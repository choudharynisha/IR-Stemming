_it isn't much of a secret, but 
it' the onli one. the trick is ..._ 

don't think about It 

By william W. stuart 

[transcriber' note: thi etext wa produc from 
world of If scienc fiction, novemb 1960. 
extens research did not uncov ani evid that 
the u.s. copyright on thi public wa renewed.] 


tommi wasn't realli a timid child. sometim he didn't understand 
thing and wa puzzled. more often, grown-up couldn't or wouldn't 
understand thing that were perfectli clear to him and he wa more 
puzzled. occasion such thing worri and even upset him a little. 
then momma and sometim daddi would translat bafflement into silli 
adult term and think that he wa afraid. 

It wa that way about the hole in the closet when tommi wa just a bit 
over three. tommi wasn't realli afraid. mr. bear wa afraid and the 
thing did puzzl tommy. So he ask about it, but he never did get ani 
sensibl or satisfactori answers, and that did worri and perhap even 
upset him a little. 

but he wasn't afraid, even befor daddi final told him, "now, tommy, 
boy. don't think about it and it won't scare you. really, there is 
noth there to hurt you, if you just don't think about it. So don't 
you think about it ani more--there' daddy' big boy." 

thi certainli wa not ani sort of explanation. but still tommi did tri 
hard not to think about it, as daddi said. and now he realli doesn't 
think about it at all ani more. Or about aunt martha, either. 

the hole wa in the closet in tommy' room. tommi and momma and daddi 
live in a not veri big, not veri new frame hous on the edg of the 
citi and aunt martha live with them. tommi didn't--at least not yet, 
although there were promises--hav ani brother or sisters. but he 
did have hi own room and a famili of hi own, too. It wa the extra 
bedroom and it had a closet that wa cramp and with no light. tommi 
like hi room. It wa small, with a small bed, and it belong to 
him, along with hi famili of mr. bear and old rabbit and kokey koala. 
It wa also in easi cri rang of momma and daddy' room and aunt 
martha' room, so if mr. bear, who wa the timid one, got frighten in 
the night, tommi could cry--pur in mr. bear' behalf--to bring help. 
Or at least company. 

tommi and hi famili all like the closet well enough too, except for 
the shelf that wa out of reach even from the "don't climb" stool. the 
closet wa good to hide in or play bear cave or rabbit hole and fine 
for find miss toy after momma had a spell of play clean 
house. 

the day tommi found the hole in the closet wa the week after hi 
third birthday. daddi wa at work. momma wa out shopping. It wa a 
raini afternoon. aunt martha wa sit with tommi and the afternoon 
television. 

* * * * * 

He wa in hi room with hi famili and they all agre as soon as they 
heard the televis come on strong that it would be a veri poor 
afternoon to wast on a nap. besides, mr. bear' feel had been 
hurt by have been somewhat left out of thing recent in favor of 
new birthday presents, now larg broken or tiresome. To make it up 
to him, tommi and old rabbit and kokey all agre to play bear cave in 
the closet. It wa a nice game and go well enough, except for some 
grumbl from kokey koala, who alway want to argu and claim that 
bear live in trees, not caves. 

but then--and it wa mr. bear' fault for want it darker, so he 
could hibernate--th closet door shut tight. that didn't seem so 
seriou at first. It would onli mean a scold for be out of bed 
when aunt martha would come to open it after tommi holler loud 
enough. and then there wa the hole in the closet, back in the corner 
next to the broken drum. they all saw it and they heard the ugli thing 
talk or think at them. It stretch out a part of itself at mr. 
bear, who wa the closest. 

It didn't grab mr. bear, but he wa terrifi just the same. and none 
of them like it. they didn't like it at all. the ugli thing couldn't 
come out of the hole becaus the hole wasn't big enough yet, but it 
tri and it wa make the hole bigger. and it kept think at them, 
red thoughts, and hungry, as it tore at the edg of the hole. the 
famili all look to tommy, so tommi cri and yelled. 

final aunt martha heard him and came to open the door. then the 
afternoon sunlight stream across the floor into the closet and the 
ugli red thought from the thing pull back, far back, so you could 
bare notic them, and you couldn't see the hole ani more, even though 
you knew it wa still there. At least tommi and mr. bear and old rabbit 
and kokey koala knew. 

after she open the closet door and carri tommi from the closet to 
the live room, aunt martha scolded. she wasn't realli mad becaus 
she had wait until a commerci interrupt her televis program 
befor answer the cri from the closet. but she scold becaus she 
wa aunt martha and scold wa what aunt martha did. A realli good 
cry, even one work up strictli as a servic for a companion, take a 
littl time to turn off. then, after a few settl gulps, tommi tri 
to explain. 

"auntie. aunt martha, there' a hole in the cave--in the closet--and 
there' a thing insid of it." 

He look at mr. bear whom he wa hold by one foot and at kokey, 
drop by aunt martha on the sofa, for confirmation. then, quickly, he 
wriggl down from auntie' lap. old rabbit! 

* * * * * 

bravely, tommi ran to the closet and wa relieved. the door wa open 
and, in the gray afternoon light, the hole wa still not to be seen. 
old rabbit, who alway had a bad temper, wa annoy and snappish at 
have been left behind. but he wa there and all right. tommi rescu 
him and ran back to aunt martha. 

"it wa hungry," he continu hi explanation. 

aunt martha, as always, wa difficult. "who is hungry? you shouldn't be 
hungry, tommy. you just had your lunch an hour ago. Do you want a glass 
of milk?" 

"not me hungry." tommi wa impatient. aunt martha never seem abl to 
grasp ani idea more complex than a glass of milk or wet pants. littl 
boys, in her mind, nearli alway either want the one or had the 
other. such thing she could and did attend to with a virtuou sens of 
duti done. but anyth els wa beyond her. 

"tommy! are your pant wet?" 

tommi sigh in resign and wet hi pants. It wa the onli thing 
to do. otherwis aunti would fuss and fume, accomplish nothing, 
understand nothing, for the rest of the afternoon. 

ten minut later, in dri pants, he finish an unwant glass of milk. 
aunt martha, conscienc appeased, return to soap opera. tommi and hi 
family, nap safe forgotten, play away the afternoon--but not in the 
closet or even, as wa usual on raini days, in tommy' room. instead, 
find daddy' old briefcas full of papers, they play offic in the 
famili room, with old rabbit grumbl about have to be miss wicksey, 
who drove the electr typewrit in daddy' office. 

momma and daddi came home togeth at a bit after five. tommi took hi 
scold about mess up daddy' paper in good part. He had expect 
it. but aunt martha wa angri about the scold she got for let 
him, mild though it was. 

In retaliation, she said, "tommy, you were a naughty, naughti boy. 
and for be so naughti you must take your big bear and your rabbit 
and the littl bear or whatev the thing is and put them away in the 
closet. and leav them there till tomorrow." 

"no! no, no, no, I won't! It isn't fair. they weren't bad. and the ugli 
thing is in the hole and it might come out and it' hungri and--and my 
famili is all afraid." 

"tommy!" aunt martha' voic wa sharp. "you stop that nonsens and put 
your toys--" 

"wait. wait up now," said daddy, who also live in the grown-up world, 
but who sometim tri to understand things. "what is thi about a 
hole in the closet? what about someth be hungry?" 

"that' all," said tommy. "the ugli thing in the hole in the closet. It 
_is_ hungry." 

there wa more to it than that, of course, but how could a thing like 
that be explain through a wall of grown, close minds? there wa 
the hole in the closet. you couldn't exactli see it. you could onli 
sort of feel see it and the hairi thing--at least it seem hairi 
and shapeless, or have mani differ shape and a mouth and sharp 
teeth--and it had reach out with someth and touch mr. bear and 
would have eaten him too, if he had blood. but then it had pull back 
from mr. bear and red hunger thought came stronger and stronger. even 
now, stretch out from the hole where it wa hidden there in the 
closet, tommi could feel the reaching, greedi thoughts. but he couldn't 
explain all that. 

"there is a hole in the closet," tommi said again. 

* * * * * 

but he knew that not even daddi would understand. Of cours momma 
wouldn't. not momma, who wa love but veri busi and just sat so 
often, dream or listen to babi sister that they said wa in her 
stomach, so big and fat now as to leav littl lap room. momma wa 
too occupi look inward to look out much at tommy. daddy, to give 
him credit, wa nearli alway will to look, but there were so mani 
thing he couldn't see. still tommi had to try. 

"the ugli thing in the hole. It want someth to eat." 

"oh, tommy! such horribl nonsense!" that wa momma. she wasn't even 
go to think about it. It is a question sometim whether babi 
sister are worth all the bother and trouble. 

"now, tommy." daddi wa be helpful. "you say there is a hole in your 
closet? and that there is someth in the hole?" 

"well-ll. sort of." really, the ugli thing wasn't so much in the hole 
as on the other side of it. but that wa close enough. 

"all right then, tommy. suppos you show it to me." 

"what?" 

"show me the hole, tommy." 

"now?" 

"yes." 

"the hole in the closet?" 

"tommy!" 

"yes, daddy." thi wasn't go to work out to anyth good and tommi 
didn't want to go back to the closet and close the closet door anyway. 
the thing didn't eat mr. bear becaus mr. bear didn't have blood. but 
daddi had and ... "tommy!" 

they went to the closet. At least, if he wa risk a daddy, tommi 
thought, he wa protect mr. bear and the others. 

"now where is thi hole, tommy?" 

"over there by the corner." tommi pointed. 

daddi went into the closet to look. tommi start to close the door. In 
the black dark, daddi would see what tommi meant about the thing in the 
hole. from the outside, tommi start to close the door. It wa a small 
closet and hardli big enough for both of them. 

"tommy! what are you tri to do? open that door." 

"but--" after all, the hole wasn't there, or scarc seem to be 
there, except in the dark. 

"open it up wider. hm-m. I believ I do see. wait till I get my 
lighter.... say, by george, I believ you'r right. there _is_ a littl 
hole there. look like a mous hole." 

there it was, as tommi might have known. grown-up will alway avoid 
see the import things. Of cours there wa a mous hole there, 
the home of the littl old mr. mous with the wiggli nose and the gray 
whiskers. He had been nice. but he wasn't there ani more and tommi had 
a pretti clear idea of what had happen to him. that poor littl old 
mr. mous had had blood. 

"but, daddy--" 

It wa hopeless. "dorrie! martha!" daddy' hunt instinct wa 
aroused. "have we got a mous trap? ani cheese? there is a hole in that 
closet, a littl old mous hole and i'm go to--" 

well, perhap thi would be better than if he hadn't found anything. 

tommi follow daddi about as he final locat a mous trap. No 
cheese? He cut a littl piec of meat for bait. Of cours tommi knew no 
trap would catch the ugli thing. 

"what in the world happen to my lighter?" daddi want to know. tommi 
didn't answer that. but at least everybody, even aunt martha, had 
forgotten about shut tommy' famili up in the closet. for now that 
wa enough. 

but later, after supper, after bath, after the shoot pictur on the 
tv, it wa time for bed. 

"daddy?" 

"get on to bed now, son. past bedtime. hop to it." 

"daddy, I want to sleep with you and momma tonight." 

* * * * * 

well, it wa a mighti dark night. the afternoon rain had built up into 
a real storm. mr. bear wa terrified. kokey wa scare and even tough 
old rabbit didn't want to sleep in tommy' room with the ugli thing in 
the hole so hungri and wait to rip it way out of the hole when it 
got dark enough--and onli the street light outsid the room to keep 
away the dark becaus they would never let tommi keep hi light on at 
night. 

"mi famili and me don't want to sleep in my room tonight." 

"now, tommy, just becaus it' a littl stormy--daddy' big boy isn't 
afraid of a littl wind and rain?" 

"i'm not afraid, daddy. it' my family. you know how famili are. you 
alway say about momma--" 

"never mind that now. To bed. your own bed." 

"but daddy, there' the ugli thing in the hole! and it' hungry!" 

"the mouse?" 

daddi went to look at hi trap, switch on the light in tommy' room. 
He came back in a minute. 

"the littl devil!" 

did daddi know? no. 

"the littl devil got away with the bait, clean as a whistle. onli a 
littl plaster dust or someth left in the trap where I put the meat." 

mr. bear shivered. "now don't be foolish, bear. you don't _have_ blood. 
the ugli thing won't get you," tommi told him softly. but mr. bear 
wouldn't listen. He wa a cry-baby, a scaredy-cat. but to tell the 
truth--th real, honest truth--th whole famili and even tommi didn't 
feel too good about it. 

"tommy? what wa that you were saying?" 

"daddy! I wanna sleep with you and momma. Me and my family. we'r 
scare of that thing." tommi knew it wa no less than hi duti to 
protect them all. 

"oh, now, tommy! you don't mean to say you'r afraid of a littl old 
mouse? A big boy like you?" 

"well, mr. bear is--i don't--daddy! It is there, honest it is, in that 
hole and it' hungri and it'll come out in the dark and--" 

"tommy! A littl mouse! get on into your room now and no more argument." 

tommy' face began to crumple. If he had to, he would fight thi one 
out all the way--tears, tantrum, kick, scream, gasp, hold hi breath 
and turn blue-- 

"now, now, tommy-boy." daddi did mean well and sometim he wa even 
right and so tommi alway did tri to do what daddi said. "tommy, you 
mustn't let thing like that bother you. If we can't catch the littl 
mouse, forget it. there' noth more we can do, so just don't think 
about it. you see?" 

sniff. "no." 

"don't think about it, that' all. there is noth there that can hurt 
you, if you just don't think about it. So don't think about it--that' 
daddy' big boy." 

"well-ll.... and then can we sleep with you and momma?" 

aunt martha rang in her nickel' worth. "A boy ought to be asham to 
be afraid of a littl mouse." 

"it' not--" 

"not what?" 

"uh--it' mr. bear that' afraid. Of the--" 

"and you just stop that nonsens about those ridicul stuf 
animals, you hear me? nobodi should make such a fuss about a littl 
mouse." 

"momma does. momma!" tommi let two fat tear trickl down hi cheeks, a 
warning, but he meant them too. "momma-a-a, can't we--" 

"all right, all right! stop thi stupid wrangling! you know how it 
get on my nerves. for goodness' sake, let him sleep with us tonight. 
anyway, _i_ don't blame him. I wouldn't sleep a wink in the same room 
with a mouse. Be sure you shut our door tonight. tight." 

"you'r spoil the child," said aunt martha sourly. 

"auntie," said tommy, "I bet you'r chicken to let your door stay open." 

"well!" huf aunt martha. "the impertinence! I certainli _shall_ keep 
my door open. No mous is go to keep me from get good, fresh 
air." 

* * * * * 

tommi wa a veri bright littl boy. now, with the door shut in momma 
and daddy' room, and aunt martha' door open, he wouldn't think about 
the ugli thing in the hole--wait for dark, real dark--to come 
out--and eat. 

"all right, tommy. thi onc you can sleep with your mother and me. get 
on to bed and mind you sleep quiet. and don't spread those stuff--your 
famili all over the bed either." 

"yes, daddy. and, daddy--" 

"what?" 

"I won't think about it now, the thing in the hole." 

tommi said hi good nights. tonight he even kiss aunt martha as if 
he meant it. and he took hi famili and he went to bed in momma and 
daddy' room. 

He did not think about the ugli thing. He went right to sleep, lie at 
the edg of the big, big bed. tommy, and old rabbit, and kokey koala, 
and even mr. bear went right to sleep. 

outsid the wind blew hard and harder and the rain drove down and it 
wa dark. the televis recept wa bad. everyon went to bed early. 
good night. light out. 

In tommy' room it wa quit dark with onli the faint, wateri ray of 
the street light on the corner swim in through the rain. In the 
closet there wa a stirring, a fumbling, a tear and the hole in the 
black grew, wa forced, bigger, wider, as the thing push and 
rip at whatev wa bar it from the warm, red, ooz food it 
craved; it must have; it would have. 

and, in a sudden gust, the wind blew harder still. somewher in town, 
block away, a wire fell and blue spark flash and crackl in 
the drip night. In tommy' hous the refriger went off, the 
electr clock stopped. the street light blink onc and wa gone and 
in tommy' closet there wa a sudden, mighti surg of effort, a break, 
and something, not a sound, but something, a harsh and bloodi sens or 
feel of rend greed flow outward from the closet in a wave. 

aunt martha, in her sleep, said, "no. oh, no!" 

daddi interrupt a snore with a strain grunt. momma whimper softli 
and hug to herself her swollen stomach. 

tommi blink and wa awake. soothingly, he pat kokey and old 
rabbit. He squeez mr. bear' paw. then he slip hi hand into the 
open in mr. bear' overal and took out daddy' cigarett lighter. 
He knew how to work it. but first he waited. 

"don't think about it," daddi had told him and he didn't think about 
it, really. but he couldn't help feel it. the ugli thing wa out, 
clear out of the hole now, and moving. He could feel that and the aw 
hunger move with it. aunt martha' room wa closest and her door wa 
open. momma and daddy' room wa closed. the ugli thing move fast, 
faster, and reach out, thirsting, hungering.... 

from aunt martha' room came the quaver wail and from the thing 
there flow a sens of vicious, evil joy. 

there it was, but wa it enough? 

tommi hug mr. bear once, tightly, and slip noiselessli from the 
bed. He wasn't think about it, he couldn't, he wouldn't think about 
it. but he knew what he had to do. He had the lighter. At the bedroom 
door he work it. open the door a crack; thrust it out. and then, in 
a littl rush, back to bed where he lay quietly, and he didn't think 
about it, he and mr. bear and old rabbit and kokey koala. 

* * * * * 

after a little, the sens of feed hunger wa gone and the feel of 
the ugli thing wa gone, back into the hole in the closet, forc back 
by the flicker yellow light of the flame start by the cigarett 
lighter. then, when the smell of smoke grew thick in the room and he 
could hear the crackl of the fire burn the house, tommi shook 
daddi awake. 

It wasn't hard to get out through the bedroom window, except for momma. 
but she made it all right. and tommi had a littl troubl hold 
tightli to each member of hi famili as daddi lift him out of the 
window, but they made it all right too. Of cours aunt martha didn't 
make it--how could she? but it wa fun watch the firemen in the rain 
from the krausmeyer' porch next door as the hous and the closet with 
the hole in the closet all burn up together. 

aunt martha? 

"funni thing," tommi heard one fireman say to anoth the next day, in 
the sunshine, as they look over the smoulder ash, "the old bat 
must have been as dri as dust inside. twenti year in the depart 
and I never did see a bodi so complet consumed--teeth, a littl 
bone.... hey, get on away from here, son! get along on home with you!" 

daddi and momma said aunt martha had gone away on a trip. tommi might 
have known pretti well where she had gone, if he had thought about it, 
but he didn't think about it. none of hi famili did. what for? aunt 
martha had had to go away, sure. she went. all right, who miss aunt 
martha? 

anyway, there were light in all of the closet in the new hous they 
move to and lot of room for everyone, even babi sister. and there 
were no holes, not even mous holes, in ani of the closets.
