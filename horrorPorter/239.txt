there Is A reaper ... 

_bi charl V. De vet_ 


doctor had given him just one month to 
live. A month to wonder, what come afterward? 
there wa one way to find out--ask a dead man! 


the amber brown of the liquor disguis the poison it held, and I 
watch with a smile on my lip as he drank it. there wa no piti in my 
heart for him. He wa a jackal in the jungl of life, and I ... I wa 
one of the carnivores. It is the lot of the jackal of life to be 
devour by the carnivore. 

suddenli the content look on hi face froze into a startl stillness. 
I knew he wa feel the first savag twing of the agoni that wa to 
come. He turn hi head and look at me, and I saw suddenli that he 
knew what I had done. 

"you murderer!" he curs me, and then hi bodi arch in the middl and 
hi voic choke off deep in hi throat. 

for a short minut he sat, tense, hi bodi stiffen by the agoni that 
rode it--un to move a muscle. I watch the torment in hi eye 
build up to a crescendo of pain, until the suffer becam so great 
that it film hi eyes, and I knew that, though he still stare 
directli at me, he no longer saw me. 

then, as suddenli as the spasm had come, the starch went out of hi bodi 
and hi back slid slowli down the chair edge. He land heavili with hi 
head rest limpli against the seat of the chair. hi right leg doubl 
up in a kind of jerk, befor he wa still. 

I knew the time had come. "where are you?" I asked. 

thi moment had cost me sixti thousand dollars. 

three week ago the best doctor in the state had given me a month to 
live. and with seven million dollar in the bank I couldn't buy a minut 
more. 

I accept the doctors' decis philosophically, like the gambler 
that I am. but I had a plan: one which necess had never forc me to 
use until now. sever year befor I had read an articl about the 
medicin men of a certain tribe of aborigin live in the jungl at 
the sourc of the amazon river. they had discov a process in which 
the juic of a certain bush--known onli to them--could be use to poison 
a man. anyon subject to thi poison died, but for a few minut after 
the life left hi bodi the medicin men could still convers with him. 
the subject, though ostens and actual dead, answer the medicin 
men' everi question. thi wa their primitive, though reportedli 
effect method of catch glimps of what lay in the world of death. 

[illustration] 

I had conceiv my idea at the time I read the article, but I had never 
had the need to use it--until the doctor gave me a month to live. then 
I spent my sixti thousand dollars, and three week later I held in my 
hand a small bottl of the witch doctors' fluid. 

the next step wa to secur my victim--mi collaborator, I prefer to 
call him. 

the man I chose wa a nobody. A homeless, friendless non-entity, pick 
up off the street. He had onc been an educ man. but now he wa onli 
a bum, and when he die he'd never be missed. A perfect man for my 
experiment. 

i'm a rich man becaus I have a system. the system is simple: I never 
make a move until I know exactli where that move will lead me. My field 
of oper is the stock market. I spend money unstintingli to secur 
the inform I need befor I take each step. I hire the best 
investigators, bribe employe and person in posit to give me the 
inform I want, and onli when I am as certain as humanli possibl 
that I cannot be wrong do I move. and the system never fails. seven 
million dollar in the bank is proof of that. 

now, know that I could not live, I intend to make the system work 
for me one last time befor I died. i'm a firm believ in the adag 
that ani situat can be whipped, given prior knowledg of it 
coming--and, of course, it attend circumstances. 

* * * * * 

for a moment he did not answer and I began to fear that my experi 
had failed. "where are you?" I repeated, louder and sharper thi time. 

the small muscl about hi eye pucker with an unnorm tension 
while the rest of hi face held it death frost. slowly, slowly, 
unnaturally--a though energ by some hyper-r power--hi lip 
and tongu moved. the word he spoke were clear. "I am in a ... a ... 
tunnel," he said. "it is lighted, dimly, but there is noth for me to 
see." blue vein show through the flesh of hi cheek like watermark 
on transluc paper. 

He paus and I urged, "go on." 

"I am alone," he said. "the realiti I knew no longer exist, and I am 
damp and cold. all about me is a sens of gloom and dejection. It is an 
apprehension--an emanation--so deep and real as to be almost a tangibl 
thing. the wall to either side of me seem to be formed, not of 
substance, but rather of the soundless cri of melancholi of spirit I 
cannot see. 

"I am waiting, wait in the gloom for someth which will come to me. 
that need to wait is an innat part of my be and I have no thought of 
question it." hi voic die again. 

"what are you wait for?" I asked. 

"I do not know," he said, hi voic dreari with the despair of centuri 
of hopelessness. "I onli know that I must wait--that compuls is 
greater than my strength to combat." 

the tone of hi voic chang slightly. "the tunnel about me is widen 
and now the wall have reced into invisibility. the tunnel ha becom 
a plain, but the plain is as desolate, as forlorn and dreari as wa the 
tunnel, and still I stand and wait. how long must thi go on?" 

He fell silent again, and I wa about to prompt him with anoth 
question--i could not afford to let the time run out in long 
silences--but abruptli the muscl about hi eye tighten and subtli a 
new aspect replac their hopeless dejection. now they express a 
black, bottomless terror. for a moment I marvel that so small a 
portion of a facial anatomi could express such horror. 

"there is someth come toward me," he said. "a--beast--of brutish 
foulness! beast is too inadequ a term to describ it, but I know no 
word to tell it form. It is an intang and evasive--thing--but veri 
real. and it is come closer! It ha no organ of sight as I know them, 
but I feel that it can see me. Or rather that it is awar of me with a 
sens sharper than vision itself. It is veri near now. Oh god, the 
malevolence, the hate--th potenti of awful, fearsom 
destruct that is it veri essence! and still I cannot move!" 

the express of terrifi anticipation, center in hi eyes, lessen 
slightly, and wa replaced, instantly, by it former deep, deep despair. 
"I am no longer afraid," he said. 

"why?" I interjected. "why?" I wa impati to learn all that I could 
befor the end came. 

"becaus ..." He paused. "becaus it hold no threat for me. somehow, 
someday, I understand--i know--that it too is seek that for which I 
wait." 

"what is it do now?" I asked. 

"it ha stop besid me and we stand together, gaze across the 
stark, empti plain. now a second aw entity, with the same leash 
virul about it, move up and stand at my other side. We all three 
wait, myself with a dark fear of thi dismal universe, my unnatur 
companion with patient, malici menace. 

"bit of ..." He faltered. "of ... I can name it onli _aura_, go out 
from the beast like an acid stream, and touch me, and the hate, and the 
venom chill my bodi like a wave of intens cold. 

"now there are other of the aw breed behind me. We stand, waiting, 
wait for that which will come. what it is I do not know." 

I could see the pallor of death creep steadili into the last corner 
of hi lips, and I knew that the end wa not far away. suddenli a black 
frustrat built up within me. "what are you wait for?" I screamed, 
the tenseness, and the import of thi moment forc me to lose the 
iron self-control upon which I have alway pride myself. I knew that 
the answer held the secret of what I must know. If I could learn that, 
my experi would not be in vain, and I could make whatev 
prepar were necessari for my own death. I had to know that answer. 

"think! think!" I pleaded. "what are you wait for?" 

"I do not know!" the dreari despair in hi eyes, sightless as they met 
mine, chill me with a cold that I felt in the marrow of my being. 
"I do not know," he repeated. "I ... yes, I do know!" 

abruptli the plasmat film clear from hi eye and I knew that for 
the first time, sinc the poison struck, he wa see me, clearly. I 
sens that thi wa the last moment befor he left--for good. It had to 
be now! 

"tell me. I command you," I cried. "what are you wait for?" 

hi voic wa quiet as he murmured, softly, implacably, befor he wa 
gone. 

"we are waiting," he said, "for _you_."
