[sidenote: _A grim tale of torture, and the blind men who were chain 
to pillar in an underground cave_] 

prefac 
the man tri hi best to sell me the house. He wa confid that I 
would like it. repeatedli he call my attent to the view. 

there wa someth in what he said about the view. the villa on the top 
of a mountain command a vision of the valley, vine-clad and 
cottage-studded. It wa an irregular bowl of green, dot with stone 
hous which were whitewash to almost pain brilliancy. 

the valley wa three and a third mile at it greatest width. stand 
at the front door of the house, an expert marksman with telescop sight 
could have place a rifl bullet in each of the white mark of cottages. 
they nestl like littl pearl amid a sea of green grape-vines. 

"A wonder view, _signor_," the real-est agent repeated. "that 
scene, at ani time of the year, is worth twice what I am ask for the 
villa." 

"but I can see all thi without buying," I argued. 

"not without trespassing." 

"but the place is old. It ha no run water." 

"wrong!" and he smile expansively, show a row of gold-fil teeth. 
"listen." 

We were silent. 

there came to us the sound of bubbl water. turning, I trace the 
sound. I found a marbl cupid spurt water in a most peculiar way into 
a wall basin. I smile and commented. 

"there is one like that in brussel and anoth in madrid. but thi is 
veri fine. however, I refer to run water in a modern bathroom." 

"but whi bath when you can sit here and enjoy the view?" 

He wa impossible. so, I wrote a check, took hi bill of sale and becam 
the owner of a mountain, top by a stone hous that seem to be half 
ruin. but he did not know, and I did not tell him that I consid the 
fountain alon worth the price that I had paid. In fact, I had come to 
itali to buy that fountain if I could; buy it and take it back to 
america with me. I knew all about that curiou piec of marble. georg 
seabrook had written to me about it. just one letter, and then he had 
gone on, good know where. georg wa like that, alway on the move. 
now I own the fountain and wa alreadi plan where I should place 
it in my new york home. certainli not in the rose garden. 

I sat down on a marbl bench and look down on the valley. the 
real-est man wa right. It wa a delicate, delici piec of 
scenery. the surround mountain were high enough to throw a constant 
shadow on some part of the valley except at high noon. there wa no sign 
of life, but I wa sure that the vineyard were aliv with husband-men 
and their families. An eagl float seren on the upper air currents, 
automat adjust himself to their constant changing. 

stretch myself, I gave one look at my car and then walk into the 
house. 

* * * * * 

In the kitchen two peasant sat, an old man and an old woman. they rose 
as I entered. 

"who are you?" I ask in english. 

they simpli smile and wave their hands. I repeat my question in 
italian. 

"we serve," the man replied. 

"serv whom?" 

"whoever is the master." 

"have you been here long?" 

"we have alway been here. It is our home." 

hi statement amus me, and I commented, "the master come and go, but 
you remain?" 

"it seem so." 

"mani masters?" 

"alas! yes. they come and go. nice young men, like you, but they do not 
stay. they buy and look at the view, and eat with us a few day and then 
they are gone." 

"and then the villa is sold again?" 

the man shrugged. "how should we know? We simpli serve." 

"then prepar me my dinner. and serv it outside, under the grapevine, 
where I can see the view." 

the woman start to obey. the man came nearer. 

"shall I carri your bag to the bedroom?" 

"yes. and I will go with you and unpack." 

He took me to a room on the second floor. there wa a bed there and a 
veri old chest of drawers. the floor, everyth about the room wa 
spotlessli clean. the wall had been freshli whitewashed. their smooth 
white suggest wonder possibl for despoliation, the 
draw of a picture, the write of a poem, the careless writh 
autograph that caus my rel so much despair. 

"have all the master slept here?" I ask carelessly. 

"all." 

"wa there one by the name of georg seabrook?" 

"I think so. but they come and go. I am old and forget." 

"and all these masters, none of them ever wrote on the walls?" 

"of a certainty. all wrote with pencil what they desir to write. who 
should say they should not? for did not the villa belong to them while 
they were here? but alway we prepar for the new master, and made the 
wall clean and beauti again." 

"you were alway sure that there would be a new master?" 

"certainly. someon must pay us our wages." 

I grave place a gold piec in hi itch palm, asking, "what did 
they write on the walls?" 

He look at me with old, unblink eyes. owl eyes! that is what they 
were, and he slowli said, 

"each wrote or drew as hi fanci led him, for they were the master and 
could do as they wished." 

"but what were the words?" 

"I cannot speak english, or read it." 

evidently, the man wa not go to talk. To me the entir situat wa 
most interesting. same servants, same villa, mani masters. they came and 
bought and wrote on the wall and left, and then my real-est friend 
sold the hous again. A fine racket! 

downstairs, outdoors, under the grapevine, eat a good italian meal, 
look at the wonder view, I came to laugh at my suspicions. I ate 
spaghetti, olives, dark bread and wine. silenc hung heavili over the 
sullen sleepi afternoon. the sky becam copper-colored. It wa about to 
rain. the old man came and show me a place to put my car, a recess in 
the wall of the house, open at one end, but shelter from the weather. 
the stone floor wa black with grease; more than one automobil had been 
kept there. 

"other car have been here," I ventured. 

"all the master had cars," the old man replied. 

* * * * * 

back on the stone galleri I wait for the storm to break. At last it 
came in a solid wall of gray wet across the valley. nearer and 
nearer it came till it delug my villa and drove me inside. 

the woman wa light candles. I took one from her hand. 

"I want to look through the house," I explained. 

she made no protest; so I start explor the first floor. one room 
wa evid the sleeping-quart for the servants; anoth wa the 
kitchen, and the remain two might have serv in the old day for 
dining-room and drawing-room. there wa littl furniture, and the wall 
were gray with time and mold. one flight of stone stair led upward to 
the bedroom, anoth to the cellar. I decid to go downstairs. 

they were steps, not made of masonry, but appar carv out of the 
live rock. the cellar wa simpli a cubic hole in the mountain. It 
all look veri old. I had the uneasi feel that origin that 
cellar had been a tomb and that later the hous had been built over it. 
but, onc at the bottom, there wa noth to indic a sepulcher. A 
few small cask of wine, some junk, odd of rope and rusti iron, those 
were in the corners; otherwise, the room wa empty, and dusty. 

"it is an odd room," I comment to myself. It seem in some way out of 
place and out of shape and size for the villa abov it. I had expect 
someth more, someth larger, gloomier. walk around, I examin 
the walls, and then someth came to my alert senses. 

three side of the room were carv out of rock, but the remain side 
wa of masonry, and in that side there wa a door. A door! and whi 
should a door be there except to lead to anoth room? there wa a door, 
and that presuppos someth on the other side. and what a door it 
was! more of a barricad than a partition. the iron hing were built to 
support weight and give complet defens and support. there wa a 
keyhole, and if the key correspond with the size of the hole, it wa 
the largest that I had ever heard of. 

naturally, I want to open the door. As master of the villa, I had a 
right to. upstair the old woman seem unabl to understand me and 
end by tell me to see her husband. he, in turn, seem incap of 
follow my stream of talk. At last, I took him to the door and point 
to the keyhole. In english, italian and sign languag I told him rather 
emphat that I want the key to that door. At last he wa will 
to admit that he understood my questions. He shook hi head. He had 
never had the key to that door. yes, he knew that there wa such a door, 
but he had never been on the other side. It wa veri old. perhap hi 
ancestor understood about it, but they were all dead. He made me tired, 
so much so that I rest by place a hand on the butt of the upper 
hinge. I knew that he wa deceiv me. live there all hi life and 
never saw the door open! 

"and you have no key to that door?" I repeated. 

"no. I have no key." 

"who ha the key?" 

"the owner of the house." 

"but I own it." 

"yes, you are the master; but I mean the one who own it all the time." 

"so, the variou master do not realli buy the place?" 

"they buy it, but they come and go." 

"but the owner keep on sell it and own it?" 

"yes." 

"must be a profit business. and who own it?" 

"donna marchesi." 

"I think I met her yesterday in sorona." 

"yes, that is where she lives." 

the storm had passed. sorona wa onli two mile away, on the other side 
of the mountain. the cellar, the door, the mysteri uncertainti on the 
other side intrigu me. I told the man that I would be back by supper, 
and I went to my bedroom to change, preparatori to make an afternoon 
call. 

In the room I found my hand black with oil. 

and that told me a good mani things, as it wa the hand that had rest 
against the upper hing of the door. I wash the hand, chang my 
cloth and drove my car to sorona. 

* * * * * 

fortunately, the donna marchesi wa at home. I might have met her 
before, but I now saw her ether beauti for the first time. At least, 
it seem ether at the first moment. In some way she wa the most 
beauti woman that I had ever seen: skin white as milk, hair a tawni 
red, pile in great mass on her head, and eye of a peculiar green, 
with pupil that were slot instead of circles. she wore her nail long, 
and they were tint red to match the titian of her hair. she seem 
surpriz to have me call on her, and more surpriz to hear of my 
errand. 

"you bought the villa?" she asked. 

"yes. though, when I bought it, I did not know that you were the owner. 
the agent never state whom he wa act for." 

"I know," she said with a smile. "franco is peculiar that way. He alway 
pretend that he own the place." 

"no doubt he ha use it more than once." 

"I fear so. the place seem to be unfortunate. I sell it with a reserv 
clause. the owner must live there. and no one seem to want to stay; so 
the place revert back to me." 

"it seem to be an old place." 

"veri old. It ha been in my famili for generations. I have tri to get 
rid of it, but what can I do when the young men will not stay?" 

she shrug her shoulder expressively. I counter with, 

"perhap if they knew, as I do, that you own the property, they would 
be content to stay, for ever, in sorona." 

"prettili said," she answered. then the room becam silent, and I heard 
her heavi breathing, like the deep purr of a cat. 

"they come and go," she said at last. 

"and, when they go, you sell to another?" I asked. 

"naturally, and with the hope that one will stay." 

"I have come for the key," I said bluntly, "the key to the cellar door." 

"are you sure you want it?" 

"absolutely! It is my villa and my cellar and my door. I want the key. I 
want to see what is on the other side of the door." 

and then it wa that I saw the pupil of her eye narrow to livid slits. 
she look at me for a second, for five, and then open a drawer in a 
cabinet near her chair, she took out the key and hand it to me. It wa 
a tool worthi of the door that it wa suppos to open, be fulli 
eight inch long and a pound in weight. 

take it, I thank her and said good-bye. fifteen minut later I wa 
back, profus in my apologies: I wa temperamental, I explained, and I 
frequent chang my mind. whatev wa on the other side of the door 
could stay there, as far as I wa concerned. then again I kiss her 
hand farewell. 

On the side street I pass through the door of a locksmith and wait 
while he complet a key. He wa follow a wax impress of the 
origin key. An hour later I wa on the way back to the villa, with the 
key in my pocket, a key that I wa sure would unlock the door, and I wa 
confid that the ladi with the cat eye felt sure that I had lost all 
interest in that door and what wa beyond it. 

the full moon wa just appear over the mountain when I drove my car 
up to the villa. I wa tired, but happy. take the candlestick in my 
hand, which candlestick wa hand to me with a deep bow by the old 
woman, I ascend the stair to my bedroom. and soon I wa fast asleep. 

* * * * * 

I awok with a start. the moon wa still shining. It wa midnight. I 
heard, or thought I heard, a deep moaning. It sound a littl like 
wave beat on a rockbound coast. then it ceas and wa replac by a 
music element that came in certain state measures. those sound were 
in the room, but they came from far away; onli by strain my sens of 
sound to the utmost could I hear anything. 

slipper on my feet, flashlight in my hand and the key in the pocket of 
my dressing-gown, I slowli descend the stairs. loud snore from the 
servants' room told, or seem to tell, of their deep slumbers. down 
into the cellar I went and put the key into the hole of the lock. the 
key turn easily--no rust there--th spring and the tumbler had been 
well oiled, like the hinges. It wa evid that the door had been use 
often. turn the light on the hinges, I saw what had made my hand 
black with oil. earnestli I damn the servants. they knew about the 
door. they knew what wa on the other side! 

just as I wa about to open the door I heard a woman' voic sing in 
italian; it sound like a select from an opera. It wa follow by 
applause, and then a moaning, and one shrill cry, as though someon had 
been hurt. there wa no doubt now as to where the sound that I heard in 
my room had come from; they had come from the other side of the door. 
there wa a mysteri there for me to solve. but I wa not readi to solv 
it; so I turn the key noiselessly, and with the door locked, tipto 
back to my bed. 

there I tri to put two and two together. they made five, seven, a 
million vagu admixtur of imposs results, all fill with weird 
forebodings. but never did they make four, and till they did, I knew the 
answer to be wrong, for two and two had to make four. 

mani chang of masters! one after anoth they came and bought and 
disappeared. A whitewash wall. what secret were cover with that 
whitewash? A door in a cellar. and what deviltri went on behind it? A 
key and a well-oil lock, and servant that knew everything. In vain 
the question came to me. _what is back of the door?_ there wa no readi 
answer. but, donna marchesi knew! wa it her voic that I had heard? she 
knew almost everyth about it, but there wa one thing that I knew and 
she did not. she did not know that I could pass through the door and 
find out what wa on the other side. she did not know that I had a key. 

the next day I plead indisposit and spent most of the hour idl 
and drows in my chamber. not till nearli midnight did I ventur down. 
the servant were certainli asleep that time. A dose of chloral in their 
wine had attend to the certainti of their slumbers. fulli dressed, 
with an automat in my pocket, I reach the cellar and open the 
door. It swung noiselessli on it well-greas hinges. the dark on 
the other side wa the black of hell. An indescrib odor came to 
me, a prison smell and with it the soft half sob, half laugh of sleep 
children, dream in their sleep, and not happy. 

I flash the light around the room. It wa not a room but a cavern, a 
cave that extend far into the distance, the roof support by stone 
pillars, set at regular intervals. As far as my light would carri I saw 
the long row of white columns. 

and to each pillar wa bound a man, by chains. they were rest on the 
stone floor, twenti or more of them, and all asleep. snores, grunt and 
weari sigh came from them, but not a singl eyelid opened. even when I 
flash the light in their face their eye were shut. 

and those face sicken me; white and drawn and fill with the line 
of deep suffering. all were cover with scars; long, narrow, deep 
scars, some fresh and red, other old and dead-white. At last, the 
sunken eyelid and the inabl to see my flashlight and respond told 
me the nauseat truth. those men were all blind. 

[illustration: "look etern into the black of hi life and 
chain to a pillar of stone."] 

A pleasant sight! one blind man, look etern into the black of 
hi life, and chain to a pillar of stone--that wa bad enough; but 
multipli that by twenty! wa it worse? could it be worse? could twenti 
men suffer more than one man? and then a thought came to me, a terrible, 
imposs thought, so horribl that I doubt my logic. but now two and 
two were begin to make four. could those men be the _masters_? they 
came and bought and left--to go to the cellar and stay there! 

"oh! donna marchesi!" I whispered. "how about those cat-eyes? If you had 
a hand in this, you are not a woman. you are a tiger." 

* * * * * 

I thought that I understood part of it. the latest master came to her 
for the key to the cellar, and then, when he onc pass through the 
door he never left. she and her servant were not there to welcom me 
that night, becaus she did not know that I had a key. 

the thought came to me that perhap one of those sleep men wa georg 
seabrook. He and I use to play tenni togeth and we knew each other 
like brothers. He had a larg scar on the back of hi right hand; a 
livid star-shap scar. with that in mind, I walk care from 
sleep man to sleep man, look at their right hands. and I found 
a right hand with a scar that wa shape like the one I knew so well. 
but that blind man, onli a skin-cov skeleton, chain to a bed of 
stone! that could not be my gay young tenni player, george! 

the discoveri nauseat me. what did it mean? what _could_ it mean? If 
the donna marchesi wa back of all that misery, what wa her motive? 

down the long cave-lik room I went. there seem to be no end to it, 
though mani of the column were surround with empti chains. onli those 
near the door had their human fli in the trap. In the opposit 
direct the row of pillar stretch into a far oblivion. I thought 
that at the end there wa the black mouth of a tunnel, but I could not 
be sure and dare not go that far to explor the truth. then, out of 
that tunnel, I heard a voic come, a sing voice. slip my shoe 
off, I ran back near the door and hid as best I could in a dark recess, 
back of a far piec of stone. I stood there in the darkness, my torch 
out, the handl of the revolv in my hand. 

the sing grew louder and louder, and then the singer came into view. 
It wa none other than donna marchesi! she carri a lantern in one hand 
and a basket in the other. hang the lantern on a nail, she took the 
basket and went from one sleep man to another. with each her 
perform wa the same; she awaken them with a kick in the face, and 
then, when they sat up cri with pain, she place a hard roll of bread 
in their blind, trembling, outstretch hand. with all fed, there wa 
silenc save for gnaw teeth break through the hard crusts. the 
poor devil were hungry, starv slowli to death, and how they wolf 
the bread! she laugh with anim delight as they cri for more. 
stand under the lamp, a love devil in her decolleté dress, she 
laugh at them. I swear I saw her yellow eyes, dilat in the 
semi-darkness! 

suddenli she gave the command, 

"up! you dogs, _up_!" 

* * * * * 

like well-train anim they rose to their feet, clumsily, but as fast 
as they could under the handicap of trembl limb and heavi chains. 
two were slow in obeying, and those she struck across the face with a 
small whip, till they whine with pain. 

they stood there in silence, twenti odd blind men, chain against as 
mani pillar of stone; and then the woman, stand in the middl of 
them, start to sing. It wa a well-train voice, but metallic, and 
her high note had in them the cri of a wild animal. No feminin 
soft there. she sang from an italian opera, and I knew that I had 
heard that song before. while she sang, her audienc wait silently. At 
last she finished, and they start to applaud. shrunken hand beat 
noisili against shrunken hands. 

she seem to watch them carefully, as though she were measur the 
degre of their appreciation. one man did not satisfi her. she went over 
and dug into hi face with long stroke of those long red nail until 
hi face wa red and her finger bloody. and when she finish her 
second song that man clap louder than ani of them. He had learn hi 
lesson. 

she end by give them each anoth roll and a dipper of water. then, 
lantern and basket in her hands, she walk away and disappear down 
the tunnel. the blind men, cri and curs in their impot rage, 
sank down on their stone beds. 

I went to my friend, and took hi hand. 

"george! georg seabrook!" I whispered. 

He sat up and cried, "who call me? who is there?" 

I told him, and he start to cry. At last he becam quiet enough to 
talk to me. what he told me, with slight variants, wa the stori of all 
the men there and all the men who had been there but who had died. each 
man had been master for a day or a week. each had found the cellar door 
and had come to the donna marchesi for the key. some had been suspici 
and had written their thought on the wall of their bedroom. but one and 
all had, in the end, found their curios more than they could resist 
and had open the door. On the other side they had been overpow and 
chain to a pillar, and there they had remain till they died. some of 
them live longer than the rest. smith of boston had been there over two 
years, though he wa cough badli and did not think that he could last 
much longer. seabrook told me their names. they were the best blood of 
america, with three englishmen and one frenchman. 

"and are you all blind?" I whispered, dread the answer. 

"yes. that happen the first night we are here. she doe it with her 
nails." 

"and she come everi night?" 

"everi night. she feed us and sing to us and we applaud. when one of 
us dies, she unchain the body, and throw it down a hole somewhere. she 
talk to us about that hole sometim and brag that she is go to 
fill it up befor she stops." 

"but who is help her?" 

"I think it is the real-est man. Of course, the old devil upstair 
help. I think that they must drug us. some of the men say that they went 
to sleep in their bed and woke, chain to their posts." 

My voic trembl as I bent over and whisper in hi ear, "what would 
you do, george, if she came and sang, and you found that you were not 
chained? you and the other men not chained? what would you men do, 
george?" 

"ask them," he snarled. "ask them, one at a time. but I know what I 
would do. I know!" 

and he start to cry, becaus he could not do it the next second; cri 
from rage and helpless till the tear ran from hi empti sockets. 

"doe she alway come at the same time?" 

"a far as I know. but time is noth to us. We just wait for death." 

"are the chain locked?" 

"yes. and she must have the key. but we could file the link if onli we 
had files. If onli each of us had a file, we could get free. perhap the 
man upstair ha a key, but I hardli think so." 

"did you write on that pretti wall upstairs, the whitewash wall?" 

"I did; I think we all did. one man wrote a sonnet to the woman, vers 
in her honor, tell about her beauti eyes. He rave about that poem 
for hour while he wa dying. did you ever see it on the wall?" 

"I did not see it. the old peopl whitewash the wall befor each new 
master comes." 

"I thought so." 

"are you sure you would know what to do, george, if she sang to you and 
you were loose?" 

"yes, we would know." 

So I left him, promis an end to the matter as soon as I could arrang 
it. 

* * * * * 

the next day saw me call on the donna marchesi. I took her flower 
that time, a corsag of vivid purpl and scarlet orchids. she 
entertain me in her music room and I, take the hint, ask her to 
sing. shyly, almost with reluctance, she did as I asked. she sang the 
select from the italian opera that I knew so well. I wa gener in 
my applause. 

she smiled. 

"you like to hear me sing?" 

"indeed! I want to hear you again. I could hear you daili without 
grow tired." 

"you'r nice," she purred. "perhap it could be arranged." 

"you are too modest. you have a wonder voice. whi not give it to the 
world?" 

"I sang onc in public," she sighed. "it wa in new york, at a privat 
musical. there were mani men there. perhap it wa stage fright; my 
voic broke badly, and the audience, especi the men, were not kind. 
I am not sure, but I thought that I heard some of them hiss me." 

"sure not!" I protested. 

"indeed, so. but no man ha hiss my sing sinc then." 

"I hope not!" I repli indignantly. "you have a wonder voice, and, 
when I applaud you, I wa sincere. By the way, may I chang my mind 
and ask for the key to the door in the cellar?" 

"do you want it, realli want it, my friend?" 

"I am sure I do. I may never use it, but it will pleas me to have it. 
littl thing in life make me happy, and thi key is a littl thing." 

"then you shall have it. will you do me a favor? wait till sunday to use 
it. today is friday, and you will not have to wait mani hours." 

"it will be a pleasur to do as you desire," I replied, kiss her 
hand. "and shall I hear you sing again? may I come often to hear you 
sing?" 

"I promis you that," she sighed. "I am sure that you will hear me sing 
often in the future. I feel that in some way our fate approach the same 
star." 

I look into her eyes, her yellow cat-eyes, and I wa sure that she 
spoke the truth. destini had certainli brought me to find her in sorona. 

* * * * * 

I bought two dozen rat-tail files, and dash across the mountain to 
milan. there I wa closet with the consul of three nations: england, 
franc and my own. they did not want to believ my story. I gave them 
names, and they had to admit that there had been inquiries, but they 
felt that the main detail were nightmares, result from an over-us 
of italian wines. but I insist that I wa not drunk with new wine. At 
last, they call in the chief of the detect bureau. He knew franco, 
the real-est agent; also the ladi in question. and he had heard 
someth of the villa; not much, but vagu whisperings. 

"we will be there saturday night," he promised. "that leav you 
tonight. the ladi will not tri to trap you till sunday. can you attend 
to the old people?" 

"they will be harmless. see that franco doe not have a chanc to 
escape. here is the extra key to the door. I will go through befor 
twelve. when I am ready, I will open the door. If I am not out by one in 
the morning, you come through with your police. Do we all understand?" 

"I understand," said the american consul. "but I still think you are 
dreaming." 

back at the villa, I again drug the old people, not much, but enough 
to insur their sleep that night. they like me. I wa liber with my 
gold, and I carelessli show them where I kept my reserve. 

then I went through the door. again I heard the donna marchesi sing to 
an audienc that would never hiss her. she left, and I start to 
distribut the files. from one blind wretch to the next I went, 
whisper word of cheer and instruct for the next night. they were 
to cut through a link in the chain, but in such a way that the tiger cat 
would not suspect that they had gain their liberty. were they pleas 
to have a hope of freedom? I am not sure, but they were delight at 
anoth prospect. 

the next night I doubl the tip to the old servants. with tear of 
gratitud in their eyes, they thank me as they call me their dear 
master. I put them to sleep as though they were babies. In fact, I 
wonder at the time if they would ever recov from the dose of chloral 
I gave them. I did not even bother to tie them, but just toss them on 
their beds. 

At half past ten, automobil began to arriv with darken lights. We 
had a lengthi conference, and soon after eleven I went through the door. 
I lost no time in make sure that each of the blind mice wa a free 
man, but I insist that they act as though bound till the proper time. 
they were trembling, but it wa not from fear, not that time. 

back in my hiding-plac I waited, and soon I heard the sing voice. 
ten minut later the donna marchesi had her lantern hung on the nail. 
ah! she wa more beauti that night than I had ever seen her. dress 
in filmi white, her beauti body, love hair, long lith limb would 
have bound ani man to her through eternity. she seem to sens that 
beauty, for, after give out the first suppli of rolls, she vari her 
program. she told her audienc how she had dress that even for 
their special pleasure. she describ her jewel and her costume. she 
almost becam grandios as she told of her beauty, and, drive in the 
dagger, she twist it as she remind them that never would they be 
abl to see her, never touch her or kiss her hand. all they could do wa 
to hear her sing, applaud and at last die. 

Of all the terribl thing in her life that littl talk to those blind 
men wa the climax. 

and then she sang. I watch her closely, and I saw what I suspected. 
she sang with her eye closed. wa she in fanci seem that she wa in 
an opera-hous befor thousand of spellbound admirers? who knows? but 
ever as she sang that night her eye were closed, and even as she came 
to a close, wait for the usual applause, her eye were closed. 

* * * * * 

she wait in the silenc for the clap of hands. It did not come. with 
terrif anger, she whirl to her basket and reach for her whip. 

"dogs!" she cried. "have you so soon forgot your lesson?" 

and then she realiz that the twenti blind men were close in on her. 
they were silent, but their outstretch hand were feel for 
someth that they want veri much. even when her whip start to cut, 
they were silent. then one man touch her. To her credit, there wa no 
sign of fear. she knew what had happened. she must have known, but she 
wa not afraid. her singl scream wa noth but the battle-cri of the 
tiger cat go into action. 

there wa a singl cry, and that wa all. the men reach for what they 
want in silence. for a while they were all in a struggl group on 
their feet, but soon they were all on the ground. It wa simpli a mass, 
and under that mass wa a biting, scratching, fighting, die animal. 

I couldn't stand it. I had plan it all, I want it all to happen, 
but when it came, I just couldn't stand it. cover with the sweat of 
fear, I ran to the door and unlock it. I swung it open, went through 
the doorway, close it and lock it again. the men, wait for me in 
the cellar, look on with doubt. It seem that they were right in 
think that my tale wa an alcohol one. 

"give me whisky!" I gasped, as I drop on the floor. 

In a few minut I had recovered. 

"open the door," I ordered. "and bring the blind men out." 

one at a time they were brought to the kitchen, and identified. some 
were terribl mutil in the face, long deep scratches, and even 
piec bitten out, and one had the corner of hi mouth torn. most of 
them were sob hysterically, but, in some way, though none said so, I 
judg that they were all happy. 

We went back to the cellar and through the door. On the stone floor wa 
a clot mass of red and white. 

"what' that?" ask the american consul. 

"I think that is the donna marchesi," I replied. "she must have met with 
an accident."
