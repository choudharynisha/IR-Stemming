I 

By the light of a tallow candle, which had been place on one end of a 
rough table, a man wa read someth written in a book. It wa an 
old account book, greatli worn; and the write wa not, apparently, 
veri legible, for the man sometim held the page close to the flame of 
the candl to get a stronger light upon it. the shadow of the book would 
then throw into obscur a half of the room, darken a number of 
face and figures; for besid the reader, eight other men were present. 
seven of them sat against the rough log walls, silent and motionless, 
and, the room be small, not veri far from the table. By extend an 
arm ani one of them could have touch the eighth man, who lay on the 
table, face upward, partli cover by a sheet, hi arm at hi sides. He 
wa dead. 

the man with the book wa not read aloud, and no one spoke; all 
seem to be wait for someth to occur; the dead man onli wa 
without expectation. from the blank dark outsid came in, through 
the apertur that serv for a window, all the ever unfamiliar nois 
of night in the wilderness--th long, nameless note of a distant coyote; 
the stilli puls thrill of tireless insect in trees; strang cri of 
night birds, so differ from those of the bird of day; the drone of 
great blunder beetles, and all that mysteri choru of small sound 
that seem alway to have been but half heard when they have suddenli 
ceased, as if consciou of an indiscretion. but noth of all thi wa 
note in that company; it member were not overmuch addict to idl 
interest in matter of no practic importance; that wa obviou in 
everi line of their rug faces--obvi even in the dim light of the 
singl candle. they were evid men of the vicinity--farm and 
woodmen. 

the person read wa a trifl different; one would have said of him 
that he wa of the world, worldly, albeit there wa that in hi 
attir which attest a certain fellowship with the organ of hi 
environment. hi coat would hardli have pass muster in san francisco: 
hi footgear wa not of urban origin, and the hat that lay by him on 
the floor (he wa the onli one uncovered) wa such that if one had 
consid it as an articl of mere person adorn he would have 
miss it meaning. In counten the man wa rather prepossessing, 
with just a hint of sternness; though that he may have assum or 
cultivated, as appropri to one in authority. for he wa a coroner. It 
wa by virtu of hi offic that he had possess of the book in which 
he wa reading; it had been found among the dead man' effects--in hi 
cabin, where the inquest wa now take place. 

when the coron had finish read he put the book into hi breast 
pocket. At that moment the door wa push open and a young man entered. 
he, clearly, wa not of mountain birth and breeding: he wa clad as 
those who dwell in cities. hi cloth wa dusty, however, as from 
travel. He had, in fact, been ride hard to attend the inquest. 

the coron nodded; no one els greet him. 

"we have wait for you," said the coroner. "it is necessari to have 
done with thi busi to-night." 

the young man smiled. "I am sorri to have kept you," he said. "I went 
away, not to evad your summons, but to post to my newspap an account 
of what I suppos I am call back to relate." 

the coron smiled. 

"the account that you post to your newspaper," he said, "differ 
probabl from that which you will give here under oath." 

"that," repli the other, rather hotli and with a visibl flush, "i as 
you choose. I use manifold paper and have a copi of what I sent. It wa 
not written as news, for it is incredible, but as fiction. It may go as 
a part of my testimoni under oath." 

"but you say it is incredible." 

"that is noth to you, sir, if I also swear that it is true." 

the coron wa appar not greatli affect by the young man' 
manifest resentment. He wa silent for some moments, hi eye upon the 
floor. the men about the side of the cabin talk in whispers, but 
seldom withdrew their gaze from the face of the corpse. present the 
coron lift hi eye and said: "we will resum the inquest." 

the men remov their hats. the wit wa sworn. 

"what is your name?" the coron asked. 

"william harker." 

"age?" 

"twenty-seven." 

"you knew the deceased, hugh morgan?" 

"yes." 

"you were with him when he died?" 

"near him." 

"how did that happen--your presence, I mean?" 

"I wa visit him at thi place to shoot and fish. A part of my 
purpose, however, wa to studi him, and hi odd, solitari way of life. 
He seem a good model for a charact in fiction. I sometim write 
stories." 

"I sometim read them." 

"thank you." 

"stori in general--not yours." 

some of the juror laughed. against a sombr background humor show high 
lights. soldier in the interv of battl laugh easily, and a jest in 
the death chamber conquer by surprise. 

"relat the circumst of thi man' death," said the coroner. "you 
may use ani note or memoranda that you please." 

the wit understood. pull a manuscript from hi breast pocket 
he held it near the candle, and turn the leav until he found the 
passag that he wanted, began to read. 




II 

"...the sun had hardli risen when we left the house. We were look for 
quail, each with a shotgun, but we had onli one dog. morgan said that 
our best ground wa beyond a certain ridg that he point out, and we 
cross it by a trail through the _chaparral_. On the other side wa 
compar level ground, thickli cover with wild oats. As we 
emerg from the _chaparral_, morgan wa but a few yard in advance. 
suddenly, we heard, at a littl distanc to our right, and partli in 
front, a nois as of some anim thrash about in the bushes, which we 
could see were violent agitated. 

"'we'v start a deer,' said. 'I wish we had brought a rifle.' 

"morgan, who had stop and wa intent watch the agit 
chaparral, said nothing, but had cock both barrel of hi gun, and wa 
hold it in readi to aim. I thought him a trifl excited, which 
surpris me, for he had a reput for except coolness, even in 
moment of sudden and immin peril. 

"'o, come!' I said. 'you are not go to fill up a deer with 
quail-shot, are you?' 

"still he did not reply; but, catch a sight of hi face as he 
turn it slightli toward me, I wa struck by the pallor of it. then I 
understood that we had seriou busi on hand, and my first conjectur 
wa that we had 'jumped' a grizzly. I advanc to morgan' side, cock 
my piec as I moved. 

"the bush were now quiet, and the sound had ceased, but morgan wa as 
attent to the place as before. 

"'what is it? what the devil is it?' I asked. 

"'that damn thing!' he replied, without turn hi head. hi voic 
wa huski and unnatural. He trembl visibly. 

"I wa about to speak further, when I observ the wild oat near the 
place of the disturb move in the most inexplic way. I can 
hardli describ it. It seem as if stir by a streak of wind, which 
not onli bent it, but press it down--crush it so that it did not 
rise, and thi movement wa slowli prolong itself directli toward us. 

"noth that I had ever seen had affect me so strang as thi 
unfamiliar and unaccount phenomenon, yet I am unabl to recal ani 
sens of fear. I remember--and tell it here because, singularli enough, 
I recollect it then--that once, in look carelessli out of an open 
window, I momentarili mistook a small tree close at hand for one of a 
group of larger tree at a littl distanc away. It look the same size 
as the others, but, be more distinctli and sharpli defin in mass 
and detail, seem out of harmoni with them. It wa a mere falsif 
of the law of aerial perspective, but it startled, almost terrifi me. 
We so reli upon the orderli oper of familiar natur law that ani 
seem suspens of them is note as a menac to our safety, a warn 
of unthink calamity. So now the appar causeless movement of the 
herbage, and the slow, undevi approach of the line of disturb 
were distinctli disquieting. My companion appear actual frightened, 
and I could hardli credit my sens when I saw him suddenli throw hi 
gun to hi shoulder and fire both barrel at the agit grass! befor 
the smoke of the discharg had clear away I heard a loud savag 
cry--a scream like that of a wild animal--and, fling hi gun upon the 
ground, morgan sprang away and ran swiftli from the spot. At the same 
instant I wa thrown violent to the ground by the impact of someth 
unseen in the smoke--som soft, heavi substanc that seem thrown 
against me with great force. 

"befor I could get upon my feet and recov my gun, which seem to 
have been struck from my hands, I heard morgan cri out as if in 
mortal agony, and mingl with hi cri were such hoars savag sound 
as one hear from fight dogs. inexpress terrified, I struggl to 
my feet and look in the direct of morgan' retreat; and may heaven 
in merci spare me from anoth sight like that! At a distanc of less 
than thirti yard wa my friend, down upon one knee, hi head thrown 
back at a fright angle, hatless, hi long hair in disord and hi 
whole bodi in violent movement from side to side, backward and forward. 
hi right arm wa lift and seem to lack the hand--at least, I 
could see none. the other arm wa invisible. At times, as my memori 
now report thi extraordinari scene, I could discern but a part of hi 
body; it wa as if he had been partli blot out--i can not otherwis 
express it--then a shift of hi posit would bring it all into view 
again. 

"all thi must have occur within a few seconds, yet in that time 
morgan assum all the postur of a determin wrestler vanquish by 
superior weight and strength. I saw noth but him, and him not alway 
distinctly. dure the entir incid hi shout and curs were heard, 
as if through an envelop uproar of such sound of rage and furi as I 
had never heard from the throat of man or brute! 

"for a moment onli I stood irresolute, then, throw down my gun, I 
ran forward to my friend' assistance. I had a vagu belief that he wa 
suffer from a fit or some form of convulsion. befor I could reach 
hi side he wa down and quiet. all sound had ceased, but, with a 
feel of such terror as even these aw event had not inspired, I 
now saw the same mysteri movement of the wild oat prolong itself 
from the trampl area about the prostrat man toward the edg of 
a wood. It wa onli when it had reach the wood that I wa abl to 
withdraw my eye and look at my companion. He wa dead." 




iii 

the coron rose from hi seat and stood besid the dead man. lift 
an edg of the sheet he pull it away, expos the entir body, 
altogeth nake and show in the candl light a clay-lik yellow. It 
had, however, broad macul of bluish-black, obvious caus by 
extravas blood from contusions. the chest and side look as if 
they had been beaten with a bludgeon. there were dread lacerations; 
the skin wa torn in strip and shreds. 

the coron move round to the end of the tabl and undid a silk 
handkerchief, which had been pass under the chin and knot on the 
top of the head. when the handkerchief wa drawn away it expos what 
had been the throat. some of the juror who had risen to get a better 
view repent their curiosity, and turn away their faces. wit 
harker went to the open window and lean out across the sill, faint and 
sick. drop the handkerchief upon the dead man' neck, the coron 
step to an angl of the room, and from a pile of cloth produc 
one garment after another, each of which he held up a moment for 
inspection. all were torn, and stiff with blood. the juror did not 
make a closer inspection. they seem rather uninterested. they had, in 
truth, seen all thi before; the onli thing that wa new to them be 
harker' testimony. 

"gentlemen," the coron said, "we have no more evidence, I think. your 
duti ha been alreadi explain to you; if there is noth you wish to 
ask you may go outsid and consid your verdict." 

the foreman rose--a tall, beard man of sixty, coars clad. 

"I should like to ask one question, mr. coroner," he said. "what asylum 
did thi yer last wit escap from?" 

"mr. harker," said the coroner, grave and tranquilly, "from what 
asylum did you last escape?" 

harker flush crimson again, but said nothing, and the seven juror 
rose and solemnli file out of the cabin. 

"if you have done insult me, sir," said harker, as soon as he and the 
offic were left alon with the dead man, "I suppos I am at liberti to 
go?" 

"yes." 

harker start to leave, but paused, with hi hand on the door latch. 
the habit of hi profess wa strong in him--strong than hi sens 
of person dignity. He turn about and said: 

"the book that you have there--i recogn it as morgan' diary. you 
seem greatli interest in it; you read in it while I wa testifying. 
may I see it? the public would like--" 

"the book will cut no figur in thi matter," repli the official, 
slip it into hi coat pocket; "all the entri in it were made 
befor the writer' death." 

As harker pass out of the hous the juri reenter and stood about the 
tabl on which the now cover corps show under the sheet with sharp 
definition. the foreman seat himself near the candle, produc 
from hi breast pocket a pencil and scrap of paper, and wrote rather 
labori the follow verdict, which with variou degre of effort 
all signed: 

"we, the jury, do find that the remain come to their death at the hand 
of a mountain lion, but some of us thinks, all the same, they had fits." 




IV 

In the diari of the late hugh morgan are certain interest entri 
having, possibly, a scientif valu as suggestions. At the inquest upon 
hi bodi the book wa not put in evidence; possibl the coron thought 
it not worth while to confus the jury. the date of the first of the 
entri mention can not be ascertained; the upper part of the leaf is 
torn away; the part of the entri remain is as follows: 

"... would run in a half circle, keep hi head turn alway toward 
the centr and again he would stand still, bark furiously. At last he 
ran away into the brush as fast as he could go. I thought at first that 
he had gone mad, but on return to the hous found no other alter 
in hi manner than what wa obvious due to fear of punishment. 

"can a dog see with hi nose? Do odor impress some olfactori centr 
with imag of the thing emit them? . . . 

"sept 2.--look at the star last night as they rose abov the 
crest of the ridg east of the house, I observ them success 
disappear--from left to right. each wa eclips but an instant, and 
onli a few at the same time, but along the entir length of the ridg 
all that were within a degre or two of the crest were blot out. It 
wa as if someth had pass along between me and them; but I could 
not see it, and the star were not thick enough to defin it outline. 
ugh! I don't like this. . . ." 

sever weeks' entri are missing, three leav be torn from the 
book. 

"sept. 27.--it ha been about here again--i find evid of it 
presenc everi day. I watch again all of last night in the same cover, 
gun in hand, double-charg with buckshot. In the morn the fresh 
footprint were there, as before. yet I would have sworn that I did not 
sleep--indeed, I hardli sleep at all. It is terrible, insupportable! If 
these amaz experi are real I shall go mad; if they are fanci 
I am mad already. 

"oct. 3.--i shall not go--it shall not drive me away. no, thi is _my_ 
house, my land. god hate a coward.... 

"oct. 5.--i can stand it no longer; I have invit harker to pass a few 
week with me--h ha a level head. I can judg from hi manner if he 
think me mad. 

"oct. 7.--i have the solut of the problem; it came to me last 
night--suddenly, as by revelation. how simple--how terribl simple! 

"there are sound that we can not hear. At either end of the scale are 
note that stir no chord of that imperfect instrument, the human ear. 
they are too high or too grave. I have observ a flock of blackbird 
occupi an entir treetop--th top of sever trees--and all in full 
song. suddenly--in a moment--at absolut the same instant--al 
spring into the air and fli away. how? they could not all see one 
another--whol treetop intervened. At no point could a leader have been 
visibl to all. there must have been a signal of warn or command, 
high and shrill abov the din, but by me unheard. I have observed, 
too, the same simultan flight when all were silent, among not onli 
blackbirds, but other birds--quail, for example, wide separ by 
bushes--even on opposit side of a hill. 

"it is known to seamen that a school of whale bask or sport on 
the surfac of the ocean, mile apart, with the convex of the earth 
between them, will sometim dive at the same instant--al gone out of 
sight in a moment. the signal ha been sounded--too grave for the ear 
of the sailor at the masthead and hi comrad on the deck--who 
nevertheless feel it vibrat in the ship as the stone of a 
cathedr are stir by the bass of the organ. 

"a with sounds, so with colors. At each end of the solar spectrum the 
chemist can detect the presenc of what are known as 'actinic' 
rays. they repres colors--integr color in the composit of 
light--which we are unabl to discern. the human eye is an imperfect 
instrument; it rang is but a few octav of the real 'chromat scale' 
I am not mad; there are color that we can not see. 

"and, god help me! the damn thing is of such a color!"
