AN occurr AT owl creek bridg 


by

the millennium fulcrum edition, 1988 


prefac 
A man stood upon a railroad bridg in northern alabama, look down 
into the swift water twenti feet below. the man' hand were behind 
hi back, the wrist bound with a cord. A rope close encircl hi 
neck. It wa attach to a stout cross-timb abov hi head and the 
slack fell to the level of hi knees. some loos board laid upon the 
tie support the rail of the railway suppli a foot for him 
and hi executioners--two privat soldier of the feder army, 
direct by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputi 
sheriff. At a short remov upon the same temporari platform wa an 
offic in the uniform of hi rank, armed. He wa a captain. A 
sentinel at each end of the bridg stood with hi rifl in the 
posit known as "support," that is to say, vertic in front of the 
left shoulder, the hammer rest on the forearm thrown straight 
across the chest--a formal and unnatur position, enforc an erect 
carriag of the body. It did not appear to be the duti of these two 
men to know what wa occur at the center of the bridge; they 
mere blockad the two end of the foot plank that travers it. 

beyond one of the sentinel nobodi wa in sight; the railroad ran 
straight away into a forest for a hundr yards, then, curving, wa 
lost to view. doubtless there wa an outpost farther along. the 
other bank of the stream wa open ground--a gentl slope top with 
a stockad of vertic tree trunks, loophol for rifles, with a 
singl embrasur through which protrud the muzzl of a brass cannon 
command the bridge. midway up the slope between the bridg and 
fort were the spectators--a singl compani of infantri in line, at 
"parad rest," the butt of their rifl on the ground, the barrel 
inclin slightli backward against the right shoulder, the hand 
cross upon the stock. A lieuten stood at the right of the line, 
the point of hi sword upon the ground, hi left hand rest upon hi 
right. except the group of four at the center of the bridge, not a 
man moved. the compani face the bridge, stare stonily, motionless. 
the sentinels, face the bank of the stream, might have been statu 
to adorn the bridge. the captain stood with fold arms, silent, 
observ the work of hi subordinates, but make no sign. death is a 
dignitari who when he come announc is to be receiv with formal 
manifest of respect, even by those most familiar with him. In 
the code of militari etiquett silenc and fixiti are form of 
deference. 

the man who wa engag in be hang wa appar about 
thirty-f year of age. He wa a civilian, if one might judg from 
hi habit, which wa that of a planter. hi featur were good--a 
straight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which hi long, dark 
hair wa comb straight back, fall behind hi ear to the collar 
of hi well fit frock coat. He wore a moustach and point 
beard, but no whiskers; hi eye were larg and dark gray, and had a 
kindli express which one would hardli have expect in one whose 
neck wa in the hemp. evid thi wa no vulgar assassin. the 
liber militari code make provis for hang mani kind of 
persons, and gentlemen are not excluded. 

the prepar be complete, the two privat soldier step 
asid and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing. 
the sergeant turn to the captain, salut and place himself 
immedi behind that officer, who in turn move apart one pace. 
these movement left the condemn man and the sergeant stand on 
the two end of the same plank, which span three of the cross-ti 
of the bridge. the end upon which the civilian stood almost, but not 
quite, reach a fourth. thi plank had been held in place by the 
weight of the captain; it wa now held by that of the sergeant. At a 
signal from the former the latter would step aside, the plank would 
tilt and the condemn man go down between two ties. the arrang 
commend itself to hi judgement as simpl and effective. hi face 
had not been cover nor hi eye bandaged. He look a moment at hi 
"unsteadfast footing," then let hi gaze wander to the swirl water 
of the stream race madli beneath hi feet. A piec of danc 
driftwood caught hi attent and hi eye follow it down the 
current. how slowli it appear to move! what a sluggish stream! 

He close hi eye in order to fix hi last thought upon hi wife and 
children. the water, touch to gold by the earli sun, the brood 
mist under the bank at some distanc down the stream, the fort, the 
soldiers, the piec of drift--al had distract him. and now he 
becam consciou of a new disturbance. strike through the thought 
of hi dear one wa sound which he could neither ignor nor 
understand, a sharp, distinct, metal percuss like the stroke of 
a blacksmith' hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ring quality. 
He wonder what it was, and whether immeasur distant or near by-- 
it seem both. it recurr wa regular, but as slow as the 
toll of a death knell. He await each new stroke with impati 
and--h knew not why--apprehension. the interv of silenc grew 
progress longer; the delay becam maddening. with their greater 
infrequ the sound increas in strength and sharpness. they hurt 
hi ear like the thrust of a knife; he fear he would shriek. what he 
heard wa the tick of hi watch. 

He unclos hi eye and saw again the water below him. "if I could 
free my hands," he thought, "I might throw off the noos and spring 
into the stream. By dive I could evad the bullet and, swim 
vigorously, reach the bank, take to the wood and get away home. My 
home, thank god, is as yet outsid their lines; my wife and littl 
one are still beyond the invader' farthest advance." 

As these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were 
flash into the doom man' brain rather than evolv from it the 
captain nod to the sergeant. the sergeant step aside. 

II 

peyton farquhar wa a well to do planter, of an old and highli 
respect alabama family. be a slave owner and like other slave 
owner a politician, he wa natur an origin secessionist and 
ardent devot to the southern cause. circumst of an imperi 
nature, which it is unnecessari to relat here, had prevent him from 
take servic with that gallant armi which had fought the disastr 
campaign end with the fall of corinth, and he chafe under the 
inglori restraint, long for the releas of hi energies, the 
larger life of the soldier, the opportun for distinction. that 
opportunity, he felt, would come, as it come to all in wartime. 
meanwhil he did what he could. No servic wa too humbl for him to 
perform in the aid of the south, no adventur too peril for him to 
undertak if consist with the charact of a civilian who wa at 
heart a soldier, and who in good faith and without too much 
qualif assent to at least a part of the frankli villain 
dictum that all is fair in love and war. 

one even while farquhar and hi wife were sit on a rustic bench 
near the entranc to hi grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the 
gate and ask for a drink of water. mrs. farquhar wa onli too happi 
to serv him with her own white hands. while she wa fetch the 
water her husband approach the dusti horseman and inquir eagerli 
for news from the front. 

"the yank are repair the railroads," said the man, "and are 
get readi for anoth advance. they have reach the owl creek 
bridge, put it in order and built a stockad on the north bank. the 
command ha issu an order, which is post everywhere, declar 
that ani civilian caught interf with the railroad, it bridges, 
tunnels, or train will be summarili hanged. I saw the order." 

"how far is it to the owl creek bridge?" farquhar asked. 

"about thirti miles." 

"i there no forc on thi side of the creek?" 

"onli a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a singl 
sentinel at thi end of the bridge." 

"suppos a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elud the 
picket post and perhap get the better of the sentinel," said 
farquhar, smiling, "what could he accomplish?" 

the soldier reflected. "I wa there a month ago," he replied. "I 
observ that the flood of last winter had lodg a great quantiti of 
driftwood against the wooden pier at thi end of the bridge. It is 
now dri and would burn like tinder." 

the ladi had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He 
thank her ceremoniously, bow to her husband and rode away. An 
hour later, after nightfall, he repass the plantation, go 
northward in the direct from which he had come. He wa a feder 
scout. 

iii 

As peyton farquhar fell straight downward through the bridg he lost 
conscious and wa as one alreadi dead. from thi state he wa 
awakened--ag later, it seem to him--bi the pain of a sharp 
pressur upon hi throat, follow by a sens of suffocation. keen, 
poignant agoni seem to shoot from hi neck downward through everi 
fiber of hi bodi and limbs. these pain appear to flash along well 
defin line of ramif and to beat with an inconceiv rapid 
periodicity. they seem like stream of pulsat fire heat him 
to an intoler temperature. As to hi head, he wa consciou of 
noth but a feel of fullness--of congestion. these sensat 
were unaccompani by thought. the intellectu part of hi natur 
wa alreadi effaced; he had power onli to feel, and feel wa 
torment. He wa consciou of motion. encompass in a lumin cloud, 
of which he wa now mere the fieri heart, without materi 
substance, he swung through unthink arc of oscillation, like a 
vast pendulum. then all at once, with terribl suddenness, the light 
about him shot upward with the nois of a loud splash; a fright 
roar wa in hi ears, and all wa cold and dark. the power of 
thought wa restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had 
fallen into the stream. there wa no addit strangulation; the 
noos about hi neck wa alreadi suffoc him and kept the water 
from hi lungs. To die of hang at the bottom of a river!--th idea 
seem to him ludicrous. He open hi eye in the dark and saw 
abov him a gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible! He wa 
still sinking, for the light becam fainter and fainter until it wa a 
mere glimmer. then it began to grow and brighten, and he knew that he 
wa rise toward the surface--knew it with reluctance, for he wa now 
veri comfortable. "to be hang and drowned," he thought, "that is 
not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot. no; I will not be shot; 
that is not fair." 

He wa not consciou of an effort, but a sharp pain in hi wrist 
appris him that he wa tri to free hi hands. He gave the 
struggl hi attention, as an idler might observ the feat of a 
juggler, without interest in the outcome. what splendid effort!--what 
magnificent, what superhuman strength! ah, that wa a fine endeavor! 
bravo! the cord fell away; hi arm part and float upward, the 
hand dimli seen on each side in the grow light. He watch them 
with a new interest as first one and then the other pounc upon the 
noos at hi neck. they tore it away and thrust it fierc aside, 
it undul resembl those of a water snake. "put it back, put 
it back!" He thought he shout these word to hi hands, for the 
undo of the noos had been succeed by the direst pang that he had 
yet experienced. hi neck ach horribly; hi brain wa on fire, hi 
heart, which had been flutter faintly, gave a great leap, tri to 
forc itself out at hi mouth. hi whole bodi wa rack and wrench 
with an insupport anguish! but hi disobedi hand gave no heed 
to the command. they beat the water vigor with quick, downward 
strokes, forc him to the surface. He felt hi head emerge; hi 
eye were blind by the sunlight; hi chest expand convulsively, 
and with a suprem and crown agoni hi lung engulf a great 
draught of air, which instantli he expel in a shriek! 

He wa now in full possess of hi physic senses. they were, 
indeed, preternatur keen and alert. someth in the aw 
disturb of hi organ system had so exalt and refin them that 
they made record of thing never befor perceived. He felt the 
rippl upon hi face and heard their separ sound as they struck. 
He look at the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individu 
trees, the leav and the vein of each leaf--h saw the veri 
insect upon them: the locusts, the brilliant bodi flies, the gray 
spider stretch their web from twig to twig. He note the 
prismat color in all the dewdrop upon a million blade of grass. 
the hum of the gnat that danc abov the eddi of the stream, 
the beat of the dragon flies' wings, the stroke of the water 
spiders' legs, like oar which had lift their boat--al these made 
audibl music. A fish slid along beneath hi eye and he heard the 
rush of it bodi part the water. 

He had come to the surfac face down the stream; in a moment the 
visibl world seem to wheel slowli round, himself the pivot point, 
and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldier upon the bridge, the 
captain, the sergeant, the two privates, hi executioners. they were 
in silhouett against the blue sky. they shout and gesticulated, 
point at him. the captain had drawn hi pistol, but did not fire; 
the other were unarmed. their movement were grotesqu and horrible, 
their form gigantic. 

suddenli he heard a sharp report and someth struck the water 
smartli within a few inch of hi head, spatter hi face with 
spray. He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinel with 
hi rifl at hi shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rise from the 
muzzle. the man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridg 
gaze into hi own through the sight of the rifle. He observ that 
it wa a gray eye and rememb have read that gray eye were 
keenest, and that all famou marksmen had them. nevertheless, thi one 
had missed. 

A counter-swirl had caught farquhar and turn him half round; he wa 
again look at the forest on the bank opposit the fort. the sound 
of a clear, high voic in a monoton singsong now rang out behind 
him and came across the water with a distinct that pierc and 
subdu all other sounds, even the beat of the rippl in hi ears. 
although no soldier, he had frequent camp enough to know the dread 
signific of that deliberate, drawling, aspir chant; the 
lieuten on shore wa take a part in the morning' work. how 
coldli and pitilessly--with what an even, calm intonation, presaging, 
and enforc tranquil in the men--with what accur measur 
interv fell those cruel words: 

"company! . . . attention! . . . shoulder arms! . . . ready!. . . 
aim! . . . fire!" 

farquhar dived--div as deepli as he could. the water roar in hi 
ear like the voic of niagara, yet he heard the dull thunder of the 
volley and, rise again toward the surface, met shine bit of 
metal, singularli flattened, oscil slowli downward. some of 
them touch him on the face and hands, then fell away, continu 
their descent. one lodg between hi collar and neck; it wa 
uncomfort warm and he snatch it out. 

As he rose to the surface, gasp for breath, he saw that he had been 
a long time under water; he wa percept farther downstream--near 
to safety. the soldier had almost finish reloading; the metal 
ramrod flash all at onc in the sunshin as they were drawn from 
the barrels, turn in the air, and thrust into their sockets. the 
two sentinel fire again, independ and ineffectually. 

the hunt man saw all thi over hi shoulder; he wa now swim 
vigor with the current. hi brain wa as energet as hi arm 
and legs; he thought with the rapid of lightning: 

"the officer," he reasoned, "will not make that martinet' error a 
second time. It is as easi to dodg a volley as a singl shot. He 
ha probabl alreadi given the command to fire at will. god help me, 
I cannot dodg them all!" 

An appal splash within two yard of him wa follow by a loud, 
rush sound, diminuendo, which seem to travel back through the air 
to the fort and die in an explos which stir the veri river to 
it deeps! A rise sheet of water curv over him, fell down upon 
him, blind him, strangl him! the cannon had taken an hand in the 
game. As he shook hi head free from the commot of the smitten 
water he heard the deflect shot hum through the air ahead, and 
in an instant it wa crack and smash the branch in the forest 
beyond. 

"they will not do that again," he thought; "the next time they will 
use a charg of grape. I must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke 
will appris me--th report arriv too late; it lag behind the 
missile. that is a good gun." 

suddenli he felt himself whirl round and round--spin like a top. 
the water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and 
men, all were commingl and blurred. object were repres by 
their color only; circular horizont streak of color--that wa all 
he saw. He had been caught in a vortex and wa be whirl on with a 
veloc of advanc and gyrat that made him giddi and sick. In few 
moment he wa flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of 
the stream--th southern bank--and behind a project point which 
conceal him from hi enemies. the sudden arrest of hi motion, the 
abras of one of hi hand on the gravel, restor him, and he wept 
with delight. He dug hi finger into the sand, threw it over himself 
in hand and audibl bless it. It look like diamonds, rubies, 
emeralds; he could think of noth beauti which it did not 
resemble. the tree upon the bank were giant garden plants; he note 
a definit order in their arrangement, inhal the fragranc of their 
blooms. A strang roseat light shone through the space among their 
trunk and the wind made in their branch the music of aeolian harps. 
He had not wish to perfect hi escape--h wa content to remain in 
that enchant spot until retaken. 

A whiz and a rattl of grapeshot among the branch high abov hi 
head rous him from hi dream. the baffl cannon had fire him a 
random farewell. He sprang to hi feet, rush up the slope bank, 
and plung into the forest. 

all that day he traveled, lay hi cours by the round sun. the 
forest seem interminable; nowher did he discov a break in it, not 
even a woodman' road. He had not known that he live in so wild a 
region. there wa someth uncanni in the revelation. 

By nightfal he wa fatigued, footsore, famished. the thought of hi 
wife and children urg him on. At last he found a road which led him 
in what he knew to be the right direction. It wa as wide and 
straight as a citi street, yet it seem untraveled. No field 
border it, no dwell anywhere. not so much as the bark of a 
dog suggest human habitation. the black bodi of the tree form 
a straight wall on both sides, termin on the horizon in a point, 
like a diagram in a lesson in perspective. overhead, as he look up 
through thi rift in the wood, shone great golden star look 
unfamiliar and group in strang constellations. He wa sure they 
were arrang in some order which had a secret and malign 
significance. the wood on either side wa full of singular noises, 
among which--once, twice, and again--h distinctli heard whisper in 
an unknown tongue. 

hi neck wa in pain and lift hi hand to it found it horribl 
swollen. He knew that it had a circl of black where the rope had 
bruis it. hi eye felt congested; he could no longer close them. 
hi tongu wa swollen with thirst; he reliev it fever by thrust 
it forward from between hi teeth into the cold air. how softli the 
turf had carpet the untravel avenue--h could no longer feel the 
roadway beneath hi feet! 

doubtless, despit hi suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking, 
for now he see anoth scene--perhap he ha mere recov from a 
delirium. He stand at the gate of hi own home. all is as he left 
it, and all bright and beauti in the morn sunshine. He must 
have travel the entir night. As he push open the gate and pass 
up the wide white walk, he see a flutter of femal garments; hi 
wife, look fresh and cool and sweet, step down from the veranda to 
meet him. At the bottom of the step she stand waiting, with a smile 
of ineff joy, an attitud of matchless grace and dignity. ah, how 
beauti she is! He spring forward with extend arms. As he is 
about to clasp her he feel a stun blow upon the back of the neck; 
a blind white light blaze all about him with a sound like the 
shock of a cannon--then all is dark and silence! 

peyton farquhar wa dead; hi body, with a broken neck, swung gentli 
from side to side beneath the timber of the owl creek bridge.
