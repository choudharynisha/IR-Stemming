[illustration:] 

twenti year had left no trace insid sam kee' littl shop on mott 
street. there were the same dusti jar of ginseng root and tigers' 
whiskers, the same littl bronz buddahs, the same gim-crack mix 
with fine jade. edith william gave a littl murmur of pleasur as the 
door shut behind them. 

"mark," she said, "it hasn't changed! It doesn't look as if a thing 
had been sold sinc we were here on our honeymoon." 

"it certainli doesn't," dr. mark william agreed, move down the 
narrow aisl behind her. "if someon hadn't told us sam kee wa dead, 
i'd believ we'd step back twenti year in time, like they do in 
those scientif stori young david reads." 

"we must buy something," hi wife said. "for a twentieth anniversari 
present for me. perhap a bell?" 

from the shadowi depth of the shop a young man emerged, american in 
dress and manner despit the orient contour of hi face and eyes. 

"good evening," he said. "may I show you something?" 

"we think we want a bell," dr. william chuckled. "but we aren't quit 
sure. you'r sam kee' son?" 

"sam kee, junior. My honor father pass to the hall of hi 
ancestor five year ago. I could just say that he died--" black eye 
twinkled--"but custom like the more floweri mode of speech. they 
think it' quaint." 

"I think it' just nice, and not quaint at all," edith william 
declared. "we'r sorri your father is dead. we'd hope to see him 
again. twenti year ago when we were a veri broke young coupl on a 
honeymoon he sold us a wonder rose-cryst necklac for half 
price." 

"i'm sure he still made a profit." the black eye twinkl again. "but 
if you'd like a bell, here are small templ bells, camel bells, dinner 
bells...." 

but even as he spoke, edith williams' hand dart to someth at the 
back of the shelf. 

"A bell carv out of crystal!" she exclaimed. "and rose-cryst at 
that. what could be more perfect? A rose-cryst wed present and a 
rose-cryst anniversari present!" 

the young man half stretch out hi hand. 

"I don't think you want that," he said. "it' broken." 

"broken?" edith william rub off the dust and held the love 
bell-shap of crystal, the size of a pear, to the light. "it look 
perfect to me." 

"I mean it is not complete." someth of the american had vanish 
from the young man. "it ha no clapper. It will not ring." 

"why, that' right." mark william took the bell. "the clapper' 
missing." 

"we can have anoth clapper made," hi wife declared. "that is, if 
the origin can't be found?" 

the young chines shook hi head. 

"the bell and the clapper were deliber separ by my father 
twenti year ago." He hesitated, then added: "mi father wa afraid of 
thi bell." 

"afraid of it?" mark william rais hi eyebrows. 

the other hesit again. 

"it will probabl sound like a stori for tourists," he said. "but my 
father believ it. thi bell wa supposedli stolen from the templ of 
a sect of buddhist somewher in the mountain of china' interior. 
just as mani occident believ that the christian judgement day will 
be herald by a blast on st. peter' trumpet, so thi small sect is 
said to believ that when a bell like thi one is rung, a bell carv 
from a singl piec of rose crystal, and consecr by ceremoni 
last ten years, ani dead within sound of it will rise and live 
again." 

"heavenly!" edith william cried. "and no pun intended. mark, think 
what a help thi bell will be in your practis when we make it ring 
again!" To the chines she added, smiling: "i'm just teas him. My 
husband is realli a veri fine surgeon." 

the other bow hi head. 

"I must tell you," he said, "you will not be abl to make it ring. 
onli the origin clapper, carv from the same block of rose crystal, 
will ring it. that is whi my father separ them." 

again he hesitated. 

"I have told you onli half of what my father told me. He said that, 
though it defeat death, death can not be defeated. rob of hi 
chosen victim, he take anoth in hi place. thu when the bell wa 
use in the templ of it origin--let us say when a high priest or a 
chief had died--a slave or servant wa place handi for death to take 
when he had been forc to relinquish hi grasp upon the import 
one." 

He smiled, shook hi head. 

"there," he said. "A preposter story. now if you wish it, the bell 
is ten dollars. plus, of course, sale tax." 

"the stori alon is worth more," dr. william declared. "I think we'd 
better have it sent, hadn't we, edith? it'll be safer in the mail than 
in our suitcase." 

"sent?" hi wife seem to come out of some deep feminin meditation. 
"oh, of course. and as for it not ringing--i shall make it ring. I 
know I shall." 

"if the stori is true," mark william murmured, "I hope not...." 

* * * * * 

the packag came on a saturday morning, when mark william wa 
catch up on the latest medic public in hi untidy, 
book-lin study. He heard edith unwrap paper in the hall outside. 
then she came in with the rose-cryst bell in her hands. 

"mark, it' here!" she said. "now to make it ring." 

she plump herself down besid hi desk. He took the bell and reach 
for a silver pencil. 

"just for the sake of curiosity," he remarked, "and not becaus I 
believ that delight sale talk we were given, let' see if it will 
ring when I tap. It should, you know." 

He tap the lip of the bell. A mute _thunk_ wa the onli response. 
then he tri with a coin, a paper knife, and the bottom of a glass. 
In each instanc the result sound wa noth like a bell ringing. 

"if you'v finished, mark," edith said then, with feminin tolerance, 
"let me show you how it' done." 

"gladly," her husband agreed. she took the bell and turn away for a 
moment. then she shook the bell vigorously. A clear, sweet ring 
shiver through the room--so thin and etheri that small involuntari 
shiver crawl up hi spine. 

"good lord!" he exclaimed. "how did you do that?" 

"I just put the clapper back in place with some thread," edith told 
him. 

"the clapper?" He struck hi forehead with hi palm. "don't tell 
me--th crystal necklac we bought twenti year ago!" 

"of course." her tone wa composed. "a soon as young sam kee told us 
about hi father' separ the clapper and the bell, I rememb 
the central crystal pendant on my necklace. It _is_ shape like a bell 
clapper--w mention it once. 

"I guess right away we had the miss clapper. but I didn't say so. 
I want to score on you, mark--" she smile affection at 
him--"and because, you know, I had a queer feel sam kee, junior, 
wouldn't let us have the bell if he guess we had the clapper." 

"I don't think he would." mark william pick up hi pipe and rub 
the bowl with hi thumb. "yet he didn't realli believ that stori he 
told us ani more than we do." 

"no, but hi father did. and if old sam kee had told it to 
us--rememb how wrinkl and wise he seemed?--i do believ we'd have 
believ the story." 

"you'r probabl right." dr. william rang the bell and waited. the 
thin, sweet sound seem to hang in the air a long moment, then wa 
gone. 

"nope," he said. "noth happened. although, of course, that may be 
becaus there wa no deceas around to respond." 

"i'm not sure I feel like joke about the story." A small frown 
gather on edith' forehead. "I had plan to use the bell as a 
dinner bell and to tell the stori to our guests. but now--i'm not 
sure." 

frowning, she stare at the bell until the ring of the telephon in 
the hall brought her out of her abstraction. 

"sit still, i'll answer." she hurri out. dr. williams, turn the 
rose crystal bell over in hi hand, could hear the sudden tension in 
her voic as she answered. He wa on hi feet when she reentered. 

"an emerg oper at the hospital," she sighed. "nice young 
man--automobil accident. fractur of the skull, dr. amo says. He 
wouldn't have disturb you but you'r the onli brain man in town, 
with dr. hendryx away on vacation." 

"I know." He wa alreadi in the hall, reach for hi hat. "man' 
work is from sun to sun, but a doctor' work is never done," he 
misquoted. 

"i'll drive you." edith follow him out. "you sit back and relax for 
anoth ten minutes...." 

* * * * * 

two hour later, as they drove homeward, the traffic wa light, which 
wa fortunate. more than onc mark, in a frown abstraction, found 
himself on the left of the center line and had to pull back into hi 
own lane. 

He had lost patient before, but never without a feel of person 
defeat. edith said he put too much of himself into everi operation. 
perhap he did. and yet--no, there wa everi reason whi the young man 
should have lived. yet, just as mark william had felt that he had 
been successful, the patient had died. 

In twenti year of marriage, edith william had learn to read hi 
thought at times. now she put a hand comfortingli on hi arm. 

"these thing happen, darling," she said. "you know that. A doctor can 
onli do so much. some of the job alway remain in the hand of 
nature. and she doe play trick at times." 

"yes, confound it, I know it," her husband growled. "but I resent 
lose that lad. there wa no valid reason for it--unless there wa 
some complic I overlooked." He shook hi head, scowling. "I 
order an autopsi but--yes, i'm go to do that autopsi myself. i'm 
go to turn back and do it now. I have to know!" 

He pull abruptli to the left to swing into a side road and turn. 
edith william never saw the car that hit them. she heard the frantic 
blare of a horn and a scream of brakes, and in a frozen instant 
realiz that there had been someon behind them, about to pass. then 
the impact came, throw her forward into the windshield and 
unconsciousness. 

* * * * * 

edith william open her eyes. even befor she realiz that she wa 
lie on the ground and that the figur bend over her wa a state 
trooper, she rememb the crash. her head hurt but there wa no 
confus in her mind. automatically, even as she tri to sit up, she 
accept the fact that there had been a crash, help had come, and she 
must have been unconsci for sever minut at least. 

"hey, lady, take it easy!" the trooper protested. "you had a bad bump. 
you got to lie still until the ambul get here. it'll be along in 
five minutes." 

"mark," edith said, pay no attention. "mi husband! Is he all 
right?" 

"now lady, please. he' be taken care of. you--" 

but she wa not listening. hold to hi arm she pull herself to a 
sit position. she saw their car on it side some yard away, other 
car pull up around them, a littl knot of stare people. saw them 
and dismiss them. her gaze found her husband, lie on the ground a 
few feet away, a coat fold beneath hi head. 

mark wa dead. she had been a doctor' wife for twenti years, and 
befor that a nurse. she knew death when she saw it. 

"mark." the word wa spoken to herself, but the trooper took it for a 
question. 

"yes, lady," he said. "he' dead. He wa still breath when I got 
here, but he die two, three minut ago." 

she got to her knees. her onli thought wa to reach hi side. she 
scrambl across the few feet of ground to him still on her knee and 
crouch besid him, fumbl for hi pulse. there wa none. there wa 
nothing. just a man who had been aliv and now wa dead. 

behind her she heard a voic raised. she turned. A large, dishevel 
man wa stand besid the trooper, talk loudly. 

"now listen, officer," he wa saying, "i'm tell you again, it 
wasn't my fault. the guy pull sharp left right in front of me. not a 
thing I could do. it' a wonder we weren't all three of us killed. you 
can see by the mark on their car it wasn't my fault--" 

edith william close her mind to the voice. she let mark' hand lie 
in her lap as she fumbl in her bag, which wa somehow still clutch 
in her fingers. she grope for a handkerchief to stem the tear which 
would not be held back. someth wa in the way--someth smooth and 
hard and cold. she drew it out and heard the thin, sweet tinkl of the 
crystal bell. she must have drop it automat into her bag as 
they were prepar to leav the house. 

the hand in her lap moved. she gasp and bent forward as her 
husband' eye opened. 

"mark!" she whispered. "mark, darling!" 

"edith," mark william said with an effort. "sorry--damn careless of 
me. think of the hospital...." 

"you'r alive!" she said. "you'r _alive_! oh, darling, darling, lie 
still, the ambul will be here ani second." 

"ambulance?" he protested. "i'm all right now. help me--sit up." 

"but mark----" 

"just a bump on the head." He struggl to sit up. the state trooper 
came over. 

"easy, buddy, easy," he said, hi voic awed. "we thought you were 
gone. now let' not lose you a second time." hi mouth wa tight. 

"hey, i'm sure glad you'r all right!" the red-fac man said in a 
rush of words. "whew, fellow, you had me all upset, even though it 
wasn't my fault. I mean, how' a guy gonna keep from hit you 
when--when----" 

"catch him!" mark william cried, but the trooper wa too late. the 
other man plung forward to the ground and lay where he had fallen 
without quivering. 

* * * * * 

the clock in the hall struck two with mute strokes. cautious edith 
william rose on her elbow and look down at her husband' face. hi 
eye open and look back at her. 

"you'r awake," she said, unnecessarily. 

"I woke up a few minut ago," he answered. "i'v been lie 
here--thinking." 

"i'll get you anoth phenobarbital. dr. amo said for you to take 
them and sleep until tomorrow." 

"I know. i'll take one presently. you know--hear that clock just 
now remind me of something." 

"yes?" 

"just befor I came to thi afternoon, after the crash, I had a 
strang impress of hear a bell ring. It sound so loud in my 
ear I open my eye to see where it was." 

"a--bell?" 

"yes. just auditori hallucination, of course." 

"but mark--" 

"yes?" 

"a--a bell did ring. I mean, I had the crystal bell in my bag and it 
tinkl a little. Do you suppose--" 

"of cours not." but though he spoke swiftli he did not sound 
convincing. "thi wa a loud bell. like a great gong." 

"but--i mean, mark darling--a moment earlier you--had no pulse." 

"no pulse?" 

"and you weren't--breathing. then the crystal bell tinkl and 
you--you...." 

"nonsense! I know what you'r think and believ me--it' nonsense!" 

"but mark." she spoke carefully. "the driver of the other car. you had 
no sooner regain conscious than he--" 

"he had a fractur skull!" dr. william interrupt sharply. "the 
ambul intern diagnos it. skull fractur often fail to show 
themselv and then--bingo, you keel over. that' what happened. now 
let' say no more about it." 

"of course." In the hall, the clock struck the quarter hour. "shall I 
fix the phenobarbit now?" 

"yes--no. Is david home?" 

she hesitated. "no, he hasn't got back yet." 

"ha he phoned? He know he' suppos to be in by midnight at the 
latest." 

"no, he--hasn't phoned. but there' a school danc tonight." 

"that' no excus for not phoning. He ha the old car, hasn't he?" 

"yes. you gave him the key thi morning, remember?" 

"all the more reason he should phone." dr. william lay silent a 
moment. "two o'clock is too late for a 17-year-old boy to be out." 

"i'll speak to him. He won't do it again. now please, mark, let me get 
you the phenobarbital. i'll stay up until david--" 

* * * * * 

the ring phone, a clamor in the darkness, interrupt her. mark 
william reach for it. the extens wa besid hi bed. 

"hello," he said. and then, although she could not hear the answer 
voice, she felt him stiffen. and she knew. As well as if she could 
hear the word she knew, with a mother' instinct for disaster. 

"yes," dr. william said. "ye ... I see ... I understand ... i'll 
come at once.... thank you for calling." 

He slid out of bed befor she could stop him. 

"an emerg call." He spoke quietly. "I have to go." He began to 
throw on hi clothes. 

"it' david," she said. "isn't it?" she sat up. "don't tri to keep me 
from knowing. it' about david." 

"yes," he said. hi voic wa veri tired. "david is hurt. I have to go 
to him. An accident." 

"he' dead." she said it steadily. "david' dead, isn't he, mark?" 

He came over and sat besid her and put hi arm around her. 

"edith," he said. "edith--yes, he' dead. forti minut ago. the 
car--went over a curve. they have him--at the counti morgue. they want 
me to--identifi him. identifi him. edith! you see, the car caught 
fire!" 

"i'm come with you," she said. "i'm come with you!" 

* * * * * 

the taxi wait in a pool of dark between two street lights. the 
long, low build which wa the counti morgue, a blue lamp over it 
door, stood below the street level. A flight of concret step went 
down to it from the sidewalk. ten minut before, dr. mark william 
had gone down those steps. now he climb back up them, stiffly, 
wearily, like an old man. 

edith wa wait in the taxi, sit forward on the edg of the 
seat, hand clenched. As he reach the last step she open the door 
and step out. 

"mark," she ask shakily, "wa it--" 

"yes, it' david." hi voic wa a monotone. "our son. i'v complet 
the formalities. for now the onli thing we can do is go home." 

"i'm go to him!" she tri to pass. He caught her wrist. discret 
the taxi driver pretend to doze. 

"no, edith! there' no need. you mustn't--se him!" 

"he' my son!" she cried. "let me go!" 

"no! what have you got under your coat?" 

"it' the bell, the rose-cryst bell!" she cried. "i'm go to ring 
it where david can hear!" 

defiantli she brought forth her hand, clutch the littl bell. "it 
brought you back, mark! now it' go to bring back david!" 

"edith!" he said in horror. "you mustn't believ that' possible. you 
can't. those were coincidences. now let me have it." 

"no! i'm go to ring it." violent she tri to break out of hi 
grip. "I want david back! i'm go to ring the bell!" 

she got her hand free. the crystal bell rang in the quiet of the earli 
morn with an eeri thinness, penetr the silenc like a silver 
knife. 

"there!" edith william panted. "i'v rung it. I know you don't 
believe, but I do. it'll bring david back." she rais her voice. 
"david!" she called. "david, son! can you hear me?" 

"edith," dr. william groaned. "you'r just torment yourself. come 
home. pleas come home." 

"not until david ha come back.... david, david, can you hear me?" she 
rang the bell again, rang it until dr. william seiz it, then she 
let him take it. 

"edith, edith," he groaned. "if onli you had let me come alone...." 

"mark, listen!" 

"what?" 

"listen!" she whisper with fierc urgency. 

He wa silent. and then finger of horror drew themselv down hi 
spine at the clear, youth voic that came up to them from the 
dark below. 

"mother?... dad?... where are you?" 

"david!" edith william breathed. "it' david! let me go! I must go 
to him." 

"no, edith!" her husband whisper frantically, as the voic below 
call again. 

"dad?... mother?... are you up there? wait for me." 

"let me go!" she sobbed. "david, we'r here! we'r up here, son!" 

"edith!" mark william gasped. "if you'v ever love me, listen to me. 
you mustn't go down there. david--i had to identifi him by hi class 
ring and hi wallet. He wa burned--terr burned!" 

"i'm go to him!" she wrench herself free and sped for the steps, 
up which now wa come a tall form, a shadow shroud in the 
darkness. 

dr. williams, horror knot hi stomach, leap to stop her. but he 
slip and fell headlong on the pavement, so that she wa abl to 
pant down the stair to meet the upcom figure. 

"oh, david," she sobbed, "david!" 

"hey, mom!" the boy held her steady. "i'm sorry. i'm terribl sorry. 
but I didn't know what had happen until I got home and you weren't 
there and then one of the fellow from the fratern call me. I 
realiz they must have made a mistake, and you'd come here, and I 
call for a taxi and came out here. My taxi let me off at the 
entranc around the block, and i'v been look for you down 
there.... poor pete!" 

"pete?" she asked. 

"pete friedburg. He wa drive the old car. I lent him the key and 
my driver' license. I shouldn't have--but he' older and he kept 
beg me...." 

"then--then it' pete who wa killed?" she gasped. "pete who 
was--burned?" 

"yes, pete. I feel terribl about lend him the car. but he wa 
suppos to be a good driver. and then them call you, you and dad 
think it wa me--" 

"then mark wa right. Of cours he wa right." she wa laugh and 
sob now. "it' just a bell, a pretti littl bell, that' all." 

"bell? I don't follow you, mom." 

"never mind," edith william gasped. "it' just a bell. It hasn't ani 
power over life and death. It doesn't bring back and it doesn't take 
away. but let' get back up to your father. He may be think that 
the bell--that the bell realli worked." 

they climb the rest of the steps. dr. mark william still lay where 
he had fallen headlong on the pavement. the cab driver wa bend 
over him, but there wa noth to be done. the crystal bell had been 
beneath him when he fell, and it had broken. one long, fine splinter 
of crystal wa embed in hi heart.
