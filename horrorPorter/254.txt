[sidenote: _A strang and curiou stori is this, about a banker whose 
onli fear wa that he might be buri alive, like hi grandfath befor 
him_] 

prefac 
A heavi still hung about the great hall and richli furnish room 
of judson mcmasters' residence, and even seem to extend out over the 
velvet lawns, the shrub-lin walk and sun-blotch reach under the 
laci elm and somber maples. 

bigg glide about the sick-chamb like a specter, appar strive 
to keep busy, while he cast countless furtive, uneasi glanc at the 
heavi figur under the white sheets. An odor of drug and fever taint 
the air, and a small walnut tabl near the flush sleeper wa laden 
with the familiar prescript bottle, tumbler and box of powders. On 
the wall behind the table, near the head of the bed, hung a small 
oil-paint of napoleon. 

the sleeper stir restlessly, rais himself pain and slowly, and 
attempt to seek fleet comfort in a new position. At the first 
movement bigg wa a shadow at the bedside, deftli manipul the 
cover and gentli aid the sick man with a tender born of long 
servic and deep affection. As the massiv gray head sank into the 
fluf pillow the tire eye opened, light by a faint glint of 
thankfulness. then they close again and the onc power bodi relaxed. 

with a pitiful, wist express on hi age face, the faith bigg 
stood helplessli peer at the sick man until hot tear began to cours 
down hi furrow cheeks, and he turn hastili away. 

"biggs!" 

the voice, still strong and commanding, cut the semi-gloom like a knife. 

biggs, who wa about to tuck the heavi curtain still more secur over 
the windows, whirl as though he had touch a live wire, and in a 
flash wa across the great room and besid the bed. 

"did you call, sir?" hi voic quavered. 

"no"--a faint twinkl light the sick man' eyes--"i just spoke." 

"ah, now sir," cri the overjoy biggs, "you are better, sir." 

"biggs, I want some air and sunshine." 

"but the doctor, sir----" 

"drat the doctor! If i'm go to pass out I want to see where i'm 
going." 

"oh, but sir," expostul the old servant, as he part the curtain 
and partial open a casement window, "I wish you wouldn't say that, 
sir." 

"I believ in face a situat squarely, biggs. My father and 
grandfath die from thi famili malady, and I guess i'm head over 
the same route." 

"please, sir," entreat biggs. 

"biggs, I want to ask you a question." 

"yes, sir?" 

"are you a christian?" 

"I tri to be, sir." 

"do you believ in death?" 

bigg wa thoroughli startl and confused. 

"why--a--w all have to die, sometime, sir," he answer haltingly, not 
know what els to say. 

"but do we actual die?" insist the sufferer. 

"well, I hope--not yet," ventur the old servant. "the doctor said----" 

"forget the doctor," interpos mcmasters. "biggs, you have been in our 
servic sinc I wa a lad, haven't you?" 

tear well into the servant' eyes, and hi voic faltered. 

"fifty-six years, come next november," he answered. 

"well, let me tell you something, that even in those fifty-six year you 
never learned, biggs. My grandfath wa buri alive!" 

"oh, sir! impossible!" cri biggs, in horror. 

"absolutely," assert the banker. 

"why--ar you--how do you know, sir?" in a hoars whisper. 

"mi father built a famili mausoleum in the far corner of thi estate, 
didn't he?" 

"yes, sir--h hate burial in the earth, sir, after read a poem of 
edgar allan poe's, sir!" 

"what poem wa that, biggs?" 

"I don't recal the name of it, but I rememb the line," falter 
biggs. 

"what wa it?" 

"oh, sir," cri the old man, "let' talk about someth cheerful." 

"not until we'r through with thi discussion, hiram." 

* * * * * 

the sound of hi given name restor bigg somewhat, for the banker 
resort to it onli on occas when he share hi deepest confid 
with hi old houseman. 

"well, the line goes, 'soft may the worm about him creep,' sir." 

A slight shudder seem to run through mcmasters' body. then after a 
tomb-lik silence, "good reason for build the mausoleum." 

"yes, sir, I think so, sir." 

"well," with an appar effort, "when they exhum my grandfather' 
remain to place them in the new vault, the casket wa opened, and----" 

"oh, sir," cri biggs, throw out a trembling, expostul hand, 
but the banker went on, relentlessly. 

"----the bodi wa turn over, on it side, with the left knee drawn up 
part-way." 

"that' the way he alway slept--in life." biggs' voic wa a hollow 
whisper. 

"and that' the reason my father, after build himself a mausoleum, 
insist that hi bodi be cremated," said mcmasters. "he took no 
chances." 

biggs' horrifi eye travel dulli to the massiv urn over the great 
fireplac and rest there, fascinated. 

"hiram, where is heaven?" 

biggs' eye flit back to rest in surpriz upon the questioner. 

"why, up there, sir," point toward the ceiling. 

"do you believ that the earth rotat on it axis?" 

"that' what I wa taught in school, sir." 

"if that hypothesi is true, we are roll through space at the rate of 
about sixteen mile a minute," figur the banker. "now you say heaven 
is up there." 

"yes, sir." 

"biggs, what time is it?" 

the servant glanc at the great clock in the corner. 

"ah, it' twelv o'clock, sir, and time for your medicine," in a voic 
full of relief. 

"never mind the drugs," command mcmasters, "until we finish our 
problem in higher mathematics. now, if I ask you where heaven is at 
midnight, which will be twelv hour from now, where will you point," 
triumphantly. 

"why, up there," repli the bewild servant, again indic the 
ceiling. 

"then," cri mcmasters, "you will be point directli opposit from 
the place you indic a moment ago; for by midnight the earth will 
have turn approxim upsid down. Do you get my point?" 

"yes, sir," repli poor biggs, thoroughli befuddled. 

"then where will heaven be at six o'clock thi evening?" fairli shout 
the sick man. 

"out there," repli the servant, hopelessly, point toward the 
window. 

"and where will heaven be at six o'clock in the morning?" 

"over there." and bigg point a trembl finger at the fireplace. 
then, "oh, sir, let' not--th doctor----" 

"hang the doctor," interrupt mcmaster testily. "i'v been think 
thi thing over, and i'v got to talk about it to someone." 

"but don't you believ in a hereafter?" queri biggs, a horribl note 
of fear in hi piti voice. 

for a moment the banker wa silent; the massiv clock tick solemnli 
on. A coal toppl with a sputter and flare in the fireplace. 

"yes, hiram," in a thought voice, "I suppos I do." 

"i'm glad to hear you say that," cri bigg in veri evid relief. 

"ah, if you could but tell me," continu the banker, "from whenc we 
come, and whither we go?" 

"if I knew, sir, i'd be equal with the creator," answer bigg with 
reverence. 

"that' well said, hiram, but it doesn't satisfi me. i'v made my place 
in the world by get to the root of things. ah, if I could onli get a 
peek behind the curtain, befor I go--back-stage, you know--mayhap I 
would not be afraid to die," and hi voic fell almost to a whisper. 

"the great director doe not permit the audienc behind the footlights, 
unless he call them," answer bigg whimsically, the ghost of a smile 
light up hi troubl features. 

"anoth thing, biggs, do you believ those stori about jonah, and 
lazarus, and the fellow they let down through a hole in the roof to be 
healed?" 

"I do, sir," with conviction. 

"do you understand how it wa done?" testily. 

"of cours not, sir, be onli a human." 

"then tell me, hiram, when you cannot see through it, how can you 
swallow all thi theology?" 

"mi faith, sir," answer biggs, simply, rais hi eye with 
reverence. 

At this, a quizzic smile came over the sick man' face. 

"in look up, hiram, don't forget, sinc it is twelve-thirty, that we 
have swung around four hundr and eighti mile from the spot you 
origin design as the locat of the pearli gates." 

"oh, sir, I beg of you," remonstr the servant, "I cannot bear to 
have you jest on such a--why, master!" he broke off with a littl cry, 
rush to hi bedside. 

the quizzic smile on the banker' face had suddenli faded, and hi 
head had fallen feebli back upon the pillow. 

"oh, whi did he wast hi strength so?" cri biggs, piteously, as with 
trembl hand and tear-blur eye he search the littl tabl for 
the smelling-salts. 

after a few breaths, the patient sigh and open hi eye wearily. 

"mi medicine, hiram, and then I must rest." 

* * * * * 

At midnight, biggs, doze in a big chair by the fire, wa arous by a 
voic from the sick bed. 

"hiram." 

"yes, sir," scurri to turn on a subdu light. 

"where is heaven now?" 

note the wan flicker of a smile, the old servant point solemnli 
downward. 

"you are a bright pupil," came in a scarc audibl voice. 

"thank you, sir." 

"do you know, biggs, I wish I had led a different--a better life." 

"you have been a good master, sir. you have been kind, you have given 
liber to charity," bigg defend him. 

"yes," cynically, "I have given liber to charity. but it ha been no 
sacrifice." 

"you have been a pillar in the church," ventur biggs. 

"yes," bitterly, "a stone pillar. I have paid handsom for my pew, and 
slept peac through the sermons. I have bought basket of food for 
the poor at thanksgiv and christma time, onli to let other reap the 
happi of give them away. I could have had so much joy out of 
christmas, if I would. I could have been a jolly, rosy-cheek santa 
clau and gone to a hundr homes, my arm load with gifts." 

"true, sir, but you made that joy possibl for others." 

"when I should have known the thrill of it myself. I have not realli 
lived, hiram. To draw the sweet truli out of life, one must humbl 
himself and serv hi fellow men. yes, the scale have fallen from my 
eyes, hiram. but it is too late, 'the spirit is will but the flesh is 
weak'." 

"it doesn't seem right, sir," said bigg after a pause. 

"what' that, hiram?" 

"why, sir, that you should be stricken down in the prime of life, just 
at a time when you could mean so much to others, while I, old and 
useless, am permit to live on. but I am not find fault with 
providence, sir," bigg hasten to say; "I just can't find the mean 
of the riddle, sir." 

"probabl i'v had my chanc and fumbl it, biggs." 

"even so, sir, god is not vindictive, accord to my ideas. there 
sure is some other solution. i'm still go to pray that He will take 
me in your stead, even if a miracl must be performed." 

"so you have faith in your prayers, do you, biggs?" 

"yes, sir, if they are unselfish prayers." 

"that brand is rather scarce, I take it," answer mcmasters, but hi 
tone wa reflect rather than sarcastic. 

"oh, sir, I wish you would pray as I do. god would sure understand." 

"rather a queer request, hiram. If my life depend upon your death no 
prayer shall ever pass my lips." 

"but, sir, i'm an old----" 

"however," interrupt mcmasters, "I shall pray that if my life is 
spare in ani other fashion, I will make full amend for my year of 
indiffer and neglect. and, hiram, no one know how much I truli seek 
thi divin dispensation. but I have alway scof at death-b 
confessions, and so my heart grow cold, for I have no right to 
ask--now." again, wearily, "no right--now." 

"ah, master, god is plenteou in mercy. If you but have the faith, sir, 
it shall make you whole." 

"veri good, had I live as you have lived, biggs." then, after a pause, 
"still, the caus is worthy, my heart is right and I shall approach the 
throne. may god be merci unto me, a sinner." 

"I hope it is not too late yet," falter biggs. "oh, if god would onli 
call me in your stead, that you might still do the good work that you 
find it in your heart to do, how gladli would I go." 

A deep sigh wa hi onli answer. 

* * * * * 

A long silenc wa final broken by the sick man. but when he spoke, 
hi voic wa so strang and uncanni that the servant hasten close and 
peer anxious into the fever-flush face of the sufferer. 

"hiram--i must tell you--a secret," came in a laborious, almost 
sepulchral, whisper. 

bigg came closer. 

"bring a chair and sit down. I must talk to you." 

As the old servant again lean forward, the suffer hesitated; then 
with an obviou effort he began. 

"hiram, I am go to give you some instruct which you must obey to 
the letter. will you promis to keep them?" 

"I swear it, sir," with great earnestness. 

"good! now, if thi fever seal my lip and the doctor pronounc me 
dead----" 

"please, sir," bigg broke in, tear stream down hi furrow cheeks, 
but hi master continu in the same subdu voice, "whatev happens, I 
am not to be embalmed--do you hear me?--not embalmed, but just laid away 
as I am now." 

"yes, sir," in a choke voice, which fulli betray the break heart 
behind it. 

"and now, hiram, the rest of the secret." He paus and beckon bigg 
to lean closer. 

"in my vault--in the mausoleum, I have had an electr button installed. 
that button connect with a silver bell. lift up that small pictur of 
napoleon, there upon the wall." 

hi hand trembl as with the palsy, bigg reach out and lift 
asid the pictur hang near the head of the bed, and there reveal 
the silver bell, fit into a small apertur in the wall. then, with a 
sob, he fell back into hi chair. 

"hiram"--in a whisper--"aft they buri me, you are to sleep in thi 
bed." 

with a cry, the old man threw out a horrified, expostul hand. 
catch it feverishly, the banker half rais himself in bed. 

"don't you understand?" he cri fiercely. "I may not be dead after all. 
rememb grandfather! and biggs--if that bell rings, get help--quick!" 

suddenli releas hi hold, mcmaster fell back limpli among the 
pillows. 

* * * * * 

all through the long night the faith bigg maintain a sleepless 
vigil, but the banker lay as immov as a stone. when the rosy-cheek 
dawn came peep audaci through the casements, bigg drew the 
heavi curtain tightli shut onc more. 

not until the doctor' motor whirl away did the patient rous from hi 
lethargy. 

appar strengthen by hi deep stupor he spoke, and bigg stood 
instantli besid him. 

"what did the doctor say?" 

bigg hesitated. 

"out with it, i'm no chicken-heart weakling." 

"noth much," admit biggs, sadly. "he onli shook hi head veri 
gravely." 

"he doesn't understand thi famili maladi ani more than the old quack 
who allow my grandfath to be buri alive," said mcmaster almost 
fiercely. 

bigg shudder and put a trembl hand to hi eyes. 

"what ail me, biggs?" almost plaintively. "no one knows. thi fever ha 
baffl the scientist for years. when you fall into a comatos 
condit they call it suspend animation. that' the best thing they 
do--find name for diseases. My famili doctor doesn't have ani more of 
an idea about thi maladi than you or I. the averag physician is just a 
guesser. He guess you have a fever and prescrib a remedy, hope 
that it will hit the spot. If it doesn't he look wise, wag hi 
head--and tri someth els on you. mayb it work and mayb it 
doesn't. the onli thing my guesser is absolut sure of is that if I 
live or if I die, he will collect a princ fee for hi services." 

bigg remain statuesqu dure the pause. 

"gad," mcmaster broke out again testily, "if I fiddl around in my 
busi like that i'd be a pauper in a month." 

"but the doctor say you'r come on," ventur biggs. 

"sure he does," answer the banker with a sneer. "that' hi stock in 
trade. I know that line of palaver. secretly, he know I am as liabl to 
be dead as aliv when he come again." 

"oh, sir, you aren't go to die!" 

"that' what i'm afraid of, biggs. but they'll call me dead and go ahead 
and embalm me and make sure of it." 

"oh, sir, I wish----" 

"now remember, biggs," broke in the sick man, "shoot the first 
undertak that tri to put that mummi stuff in my veins." 

"I understand perfectly, sir," answer biggs, fear lest the other' 
excit might again give him a turn for the worse. 

"I know i'm appar go to pass away. My father and grandfath 
both had thi cuss viru in their veins, and I don't believ either of 
them wa dead when he wa pronounc so!" 

"well, if by ani chance--that is, if you," began bigg desperately, "if 
you are apparently--dead--whi not have them keep your bodi here in the 
hous for a time?" 

"convention, formality, custom, hide-bound law!" the banker fairli 
frothed. "the health author would come here with an armi and see 
that I wa buried. no, biggs, i'v got a fine crypt out there, all quiet 
and secure, good ventilation, electr lights, like a pullman berth--and 
a push-button. that preclud all notoriety. it' secret and safe. the 
electrician who instal the apparatu die four year ago. So you and 
I, alone, possess thi knowledge." 

"don't you think someon els should know of it too? your attorney, 
or----" 

"no, biggs. If I realli am dead I don't want anyon to write up my 
eccentr for some sunday magazin sheet. and if I do come back, 
then it will be time to tell the gape public about my cleverness." 

"I wish you weren't so--so cold-blood about it all, sir." 

"I have alway hit straight from the shoulder, hiram, and i'm face 
thi death busi as i'd face ani other proposition. i'm not readi to 
cash in, and if I can cheat the doctors, undertakers, lawyers, heirs, 
and chief mourner for a few more years, i'm go to do it. and don't 
forget poor old granddad. He might have been up and about yet had he but 
use my scheme." 

* * * * * 

bigg turn away, sick at heart. It wa too terribl beyond words. To 
him hi religion wa as essenti as daili bread. death wa the 
culmin of cherish belief and constant prayer. As hi year 
declin he had face the inevit day with simpl faith that when the 
summon came he would go gladly, like him "who wrap the draperi of hi 
couch about him and lie down to pleasant dreams." with throb heart 
he listen for anoth torrent of word that would still further stab 
hi sensit soul; for he had love and rever hi master from hi 
youth up. 

but no word came. He wheel about. the massiv head had fallen limpli 
among the pillows. pallid lip were tri to form sentenc without 
result. then the great bodi seem to subsid immeasur deeper into 
the cover and a death-lik still fell upon the room. 

intuit feel that hi master wa wors than at ani previou 
relapse, bigg made everi effort to reviv him, gentli at first, and 
then by vigor shake and call to him in a heart-broken, piteou 
voice. but to no avail. the heavi figur look pallid and corpse-lik 
under the snowi sheets. 

long hour drag by, and still the lone old servant sat mute 
besid the bed, onli aroused, at last, by the peremptory, measur call 
of the telephon bell. 

"yes," said bigg in a quaver voice. "oh yes, doctor meredith, 
master' rest easy. don't think you'll need to come until tomorrow." 

"i'll keep them away as long as I can," he muttered, as he slip back 
to hi vigil. "god grant--mayb he'll come back--and take up the work of 
the master, so long delayed. Oh god! If thou wouldst onli take me in hi 
stead!" 

sleep fitfully, bigg sat dumbl through an intermin night, but 
the new day brought no reassur sign from the inert form. the 
still wa appalling. the other servant were quarter in a distant 
part of the mansion and onli came when summoned. again bigg assur the 
physician that he could gain noth by calling, and anoth aw night 
found him, ashen and distraught, at the bedside. sometim in the still 
watch he swoon and kindli natur patch up hi shred nerves, 
befor conscious onc more arous him. but the strain wa more than 
he could bear. So when the anxiou specialist came, unbidden, he found a 
shatter old watchman who broke down complet and babbl forth the 
whole mysteri tale, conceal noth but the secret of the tomb. 

In a coffin previous made to order, they laid the unembalm remain 
of judson mcmaster in the famili mausoleum, and the world which had 
felt hi master presenc for so mani year paus long enough to lay 
a costli tribut on hi bier and then went smoothli on it way. 

not so with the faith biggs. ensconc in hi master' bedroom, he 
nightli toss in troubl sleep, fill with the jangl of 
innumer electr bells. and when--on the tenth night, after he had 
been somewhat reassur that all wa well--h wa suddenli awaken by a 
mad, incess ring from the hidden alarm, a deathli weak 
overcam him and it wa some time befor he wa abl to drag hi palsi 
bodi from the bed. with fumbling, clumsi finger he tri to hasten, but 
it wa mani minut befor he tottered, half dressed, out of the room. 
and as he did so, hi heart almost stood still, then mount to hi 
throat as if to choke him. 

"biggs!"--a voice--mcmaster' voic wa calling. 

He stagger to the head of the wide, massiv stairway and look down. 
there stood the banker, pale, emaciated, but smiling. 

and then, as from an endless distance, came more words: 

"I forgot to tell you that I had a trap-door in the end of the casket. 
when you didn't answer the bell, I found I could come alone." 

with an inarticul cry, bigg stretch out hi trembl arms. 

"mi master, I am come now." 

then he swayed, stumbled, clutch feebli at the rail and plung 
headlong to the foot of the stairs, a crumpled, lifeless form.
