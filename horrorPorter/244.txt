[sidenote: _A stori of the shock revel that came to the 
twenty-first baron kralitz_] 

prefac 
I awok from profound sleep to find two black-swath form stand 
silent besid me, their face pale blur in the gloom. As I blink to 
clear my sleep-dim eyes, one of them beckon impatiently, and 
suddenli I realiz the purpos of thi midnight summons. for year I 
had been expect it, ever sinc my father, the baron kralitz, had 
reveal to me the secret and the curs that hung over our ancient 
house. and so, without a word, I rose and follow my guid as they led 
me along the gloomi corridor of the castl that had been my home sinc 
birth. 

As I proceed there rose up in my mind the stern face of my father, and 
in my ear rang hi solemn word as he told me of the legendari curs of 
the hous of kralitz, the unknown secret that wa impart to the eldest 
son of each generation--at a certain time. 

"when?" I had ask my father as he lay on hi death-bed, fight back 
the approach of dissolution. 

"when you are abl to understand," he had told me, watch my face 
intent from beneath hi tuft white brows. "some are told the secret 
sooner than others. sinc the first baron kralitz the secret ha been 
hand down----" 

He clutch at hi breast and paused. It wa fulli five minut befor 
he had gather hi strength to speak again in hi rolling, power 
voice. No gasping, death-b confess for the baron kralitz! 

He said at last, "you have seen the ruin of the old monasteri near the 
village, franz. the first baron burnt it and put the monk to the sword. 
the abbot interf too often with the baron' whims. A girl sought 
shelter and the abbot refus to give her up at the baron' demand. hi 
patienc wa at an end--you know the tale they still tell about him. 

"he slew the abbot, burn the monastery, and took the girl. befor he 
die the abbot curs hi slayer, and curs hi son for unborn 
generations. and it is the natur of thi curs that is the secret of 
our house. 

"I may not tell you what the curs is. Do not seek to discov it befor 
it is reveal to you. wait patiently, and in due time you will be taken 
by the warder of the secret down the stairway to the underground 
cavern. and then you will learn the secret of kralitz." 

As the last word pass my father' lip he died, hi stern face still 
set in it harsh lines. 

* * * * * 

deep in my memories, I had not notic our path, but now the dark form 
of my guid paus besid a gap in the stone flagging, where a stairway 
which I had never seen dure my wander about the castl led into 
subterranean depths. down thi stairway I wa conducted, and present I 
came to realiz that there wa light of a sort--a dim, phosphoresc 
radianc that came from no recogniz source, and seem to be less 
actual light than the accustom of my eye to the near-darkness. 

I went down for a long time. the stairway turn and twist in the 
rock, and the bob form ahead were my onli relief from the monotoni 
of the intermin descent. and at last, deep underground, the long 
stairway ended, and I gaze over the shoulder of my guid at the great 
door that bar my path. It wa roughli chisel from the solid stone, 
and upon it were curiou and strang disquiet carvings, symbol 
which I did not recognize. It swung open, and I pass through and 
paused, stare about me through a gray sea of mist. 

I stood upon a gentl slope that fell away into the fog-hidden distance, 
from which came a pandemonium of muffl bellow and high-pitched, 
shrill squeak vagu akin to obscen laughter. dark, half-glimps 
shape swam into sight through the haze and disappear again, and great 
vagu shadow swept overhead on silent wings. almost besid me wa a 
long rectangular tabl of stone, and at thi tabl two score of men were 
seated, watch me from eye that gleam dulli out of deep sockets. My 
two guid silent took their place among them. 

and suddenli the thick fog began to lift. It wa swept raggedli away on 
the breath of a chill wind. the far dim reach of the cavern were 
reveal as the mist swiftli dissipated, and I stood silent in the grip 
of a mighti fear, and, strangely, an equal potent, unaccount 
thrill of delight. A part of my mind seem to ask, "what horror is 
this?" and anoth part whispered, "you know thi place!" 

but I could never have seen it before. If I had realiz what lay far 
beneath the castl I could never have slept at night for the fear that 
would have obsess me. for, stand silent with conflict tide of 
horror and ecstasi race through me, I saw the weird inhabit of the 
underground world. 

demons, monsters, unnam things! nightmar colossi strode bellow 
through the murk, and amorph gray thing like giant slug walk 
upright on stumpi legs. creatur of shapeless soft pulp, be with 
flame-shot eye scatter over their misshapen bodi like fabl argus, 
writh and twist there in the evil glow. wing thing that were not 
bat swoop and flutter in the tenebr air, whisper 
sibilantly--whisp in _human_ voices. 

far away at the bottom of the slope I could see the chill gleam of 
water, a hidden, sunless sea. shape merci almost hidden by 
distanc and the semi-dark sport and cried, troubl the surfac 
of the lake, the size of which I could onli conjecture. and a flap 
thing whose leatheri wing stretch like a tent abov my head swoop 
and hover for a moment, stare with flame eyes, and then dart off 
and wa lost in the gloom. 

and all the while, as I shudder with fear and loathing, within me wa 
thi evil glee--thi voic which whispered, "you know thi place! you 
belong here! Is it not good to be home?" 

I glanc behind me. the great door had swung silent shut, and escap 
wa impossible. and then pride came to my aid. I wa a kralitz. and a 
kralitz would not acknowledg fear in the face of the devil himself! 

* * * * * 

I step forward and confront the warders, who were still seat 
regard me intent from eye in which a smolder fire seem to 
burn. fight down an insan dread that I might find befor me an array 
of fleshless skeletons, I step to the head of the table, where there 
wa a sort of crude throne, and peer close at the silent figur on 
my right. 

It wa no bare skull at which I gazed, but a bearded, deadly-pal face. 
the curved, voluptu lip were crimson, look almost rouged, and the 
dull eye stare through me bleakly. inhuman agoni had etch itself in 
deep line on the white face, and gnaw anguish smolder in the 
sunken eyes. I cannot hope to convey the utter strangeness, the 
atmospher of unearthli that surround him, almost as palpabl as 
the fetid tomb-stench that well from hi dark garments. He wave a 
black-swath arm to the vacant seat at the head of the table, and I sat 
down. 

thi nightmar sens of unreality! I seem to be in a dream, with a 
hidden part of my mind slowli wake from sleep into evil life to take 
command of my faculties. the tabl wa set with old-fashion goblet 
and trencher such as had not been use for hundr of years. there wa 
meat on the trenchers, and red liquor in the jewel goblets. A heady, 
overpow fragranc swam up into my nostrils, mix with the 
grave-smel of my companion and the musti odor of a dank and sunless 
place. 

everi white face wa turn to me, face that seem oddli familiar, 
although I did not know why. each face wa alik in it blood-red, 
sensual lip and it express of gnaw agony, and burn black eye 
like the abysm pit of tartaru stare at me until I felt the short 
hair stir on my neck. but--i wa a kralitz! I stood up and said boldli 
in archaic german that somehow came familiarli from my lips, "I am 
franz, twenty-first baron kralitz. what do you want with me?" 

A murmur of approv went around the long table. there wa a stir. from 
the foot of the board a huge beard man arose, a man with a fright 
scar that made the left side of hi face a horror of heal white 
tissue. again the odd thrill of familiar ran through me; I had seen 
that face before, and vagu I rememb look at it through dim 
twilight. 

the man spoke in the old guttur german. "we greet you, franz, baron 
kralitz. We greet you and pledg you, franz--and we pledg the hous of 
kralitz!" 

with that he caught up the goblet befor him and held it high. all along 
the long tabl the black-swath one arose, and each held high hi 
jewel cup, and pledg me. they drank deeply, savor the liquor, and 
I made the bow custom demanded. I said, in word that sprang almost 
unbidden from my mouth: 

"I greet you, who are the warder of the secret of kralitz, and I pledg 
you in return." 

all about me, to the farthermost reach of the dim cavern, a hush fell, 
and the bellow and howlings, and the insan titter of the fli 
things, were no longer heard. My companion lean expectantli toward 
me. stand alon at the head of the board, I rais my goblet and 
drank. the liquor wa heady, exhilarating, with a faintli brackish 
flavor. 

and abruptli I knew whi the pain-racked, ruin face of my companion had 
seem familiar; I had seen it often among the portrait of my 
ancestors, the frowning, disfigur visag of the founder of the hous 
of kralitz that glare down from the gloom of the great hall. In that 
fierc white light of revel I knew my companion for what they 
were; I recogn them, one by one, rememb their canva 
counterparts. but there wa a change! like an impalp veil, the stamp 
of ineradic evil lay on the tortur face of my hosts, strang 
alter their features, so that I could not alway be sure I recogn 
them. one pale, sardon face remind me of my father, but I could not 
be sure, so monstrous alter wa it expression. 

I wa dine with my ancestors--th hous of kralitz! 

My cup wa still held high, and I drain it, for somehow the grim 
revel wa not entir unexpected. A strang glow thrill through 
my veins, and I laugh aloud for the evil delight that wa in me. the 
other laugh too, a deep-throat merriment like the bark of 
wolves--tortur laughter from men stretch on the rack, mad laughter 
in hell! and all through the hazi cavern came the clamor of the devil' 
brood! great figur that tower mani span high rock with thunder 
glee, and the fli thing titter slyli overhead. and out over the 
vast expans swept the wave of fright mirth, until the half-seen 
thing in the black water sent out bellow that tore at my eardrums, 
and the unseen roof far overhead sent back roar echo of the clamor. 

and I laugh with them, laugh insanely, until I drop exhaust 
into my seat and watch the scar man at the other end of the tabl 
as he spoke. 

"you are worthi to be of our company, and worthi to eat at the same 
board. We have pledg each other, and you are one of us; we shall eat 
together." 

and we fell to, tear like hungri beast at the succul white meat 
in the jewel trenchers. strang monster serv us, and at a chill 
touch on my arm I turn to find a dread crimson thing, like a 
skin child, refil my goblet. strange, strang and utterli 
blasphem wa our feast. We shout and laugh and fed there in the 
hazi light, while all around us thunder the evil horde. there wa hell 
beneath castl kralitz, and it held high carniv thi night. 

* * * * * 

present we sang a fierc drinking-song, swing the deep cup back 
and forth in rhythm with our shout chant. It wa an archaic song, but 
the obsolet word were no handicap, for I mouth them as though they 
had been learn at my mother' knee. and at the thought of my mother a 
trembl and a weak ran through me abruptly, but I banish it with 
a draft of the headi liquor. 

long, long we shout and sang and carous there in the great cavern, 
and after a time we aros togeth and troop to where a narrow, 
high-arch bridg span the tenebr water of the lake. but I may 
not speak of what wa at the other end of the bridge, nor of the 
unnam thing that I saw--and did! I learn of the fungoid, inhuman 
be that dwell on far cold yuggoth, of the cyclopean shape that 
attend unsleep cthulhu in hi submarin city, of the strang 
pleasur that the follow of leprous, subterranean yog-sothoth may 
possess, and I learned, too, of the unbeliev manner in which iod, 
the source, is worship beyond the outer galaxies. I plumb the 
blackest pit of hell and came back--laughing. I wa one with the rest 
of those dark warders, and I join them in the saturnalia of horror 
until the scar man spoke to us again. 

"our time grow short," he said, hi scar and beard white face like 
a gargoyle' in the half-light. "we must depart soon. but you are a true 
kralitz, franz, and we shall meet again, and feast again, and make merri 
for longer than you think. one last pledge!" 

I gave it to him. "to the hous of kralitz! may it never fall!" 

and with an exult shout we drain the pungent dreg of the liquor. 

then a strang lassitud fell upon me. with the other I turn my back 
on the cavern and the shape that pranc and bellow and crawl 
there, and I went up through the carv stone portal. We file up the 
stairs, up and up, endlessly, until at last we emerg through the 
gape hole in the stone flag and proceeded, a dark, silent company, 
back through those intermin corridors. the surround began to 
grow strang familiar, and suddenli I recogn them. 

We were in the great burial vault below the castle, where the baron 
kralitz were ceremoni entombed. each baron had been place in hi 
stone casket in hi separ chamber, and each chamber lay, like bead 
on a necklace, adjac to the next, so that we proceed from the 
farthermost tomb of the earli baron kralitz toward the unoccupi 
vaults. By immemori custom, each tomb lay bare, an empti mausoleum, 
until the time had come for it use, when the great stone coffin, with 
the memori inscript carv upon it, would be carri to it place. 
It wa fitting, indeed, for the secret of kralitz to be hidden here. 

abruptli I realiz that I wa alone, save for the beard man with the 
disfigur scar. the other had vanished, and, deep in my thoughts, I 
had not miss them. My companion stretch out hi black-swath arm 
and halt my progress, and I turn to him questioningly. He said in 
hi sonor voice, "I must leav you now. I must go back to my own 
place." and he point to the way whenc we had come. 

I nodded, for I had alreadi recogn my companion for what they were. 
I knew that each baron kralitz had been laid in hi tomb, onli to aris 
as a monstrou thing neither dead nor alive, to descend into the cavern 
below and take part in the evil saturnalia. I realized, too, that with 
the approach of dawn they had return to their stone coffins, to lie in 
a death-lik tranc until the set sun should bring brief liberation. 
My own occult studi had enabl me to recogn these dread 
manifestations. 

I bow to my companion and would have proceed on my way to the upper 
part of the castle, but he bar my path. He shook hi head slowly, 
hi scar hideou in the phosphoresc gloom. 

I said, "may I not go yet?" 

He stare at me with tortured, smolder eye that had look into hell 
itself, and he point to what lay besid me, and in a flash of 
nightmar realiz I knew the secret of the curs of kralitz. there 
came to me the knowledg that made my brain a fright thing in which 
shape of dark would ever swirl and scream; the dread 
comprehens of _when_ each baron kralitz wa initi into the 
brotherhood of blood. I knew--_i knew_--that no coffin had ever been 
place unoccupi in the tombs, and I read upon the stone sarcophagu at 
my feet the inscript that made my doom known to me--_mi own name, 
"franz, twenty-first baron kralitz."_
