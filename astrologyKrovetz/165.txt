but it is clear that similar description were transmit by a second 
translate from the greece which was utilize in the now lost astrology 
poem of satya (second or third century); satya's verse are reflect in 
the vrddhayavanajâtaka11 of mînarâja (fourth century), and in the 
laghujätaka12 and brhajjâtaka13 of varähamihira (sixth century). but 
varähamihira has also use the yavanajâtaka, as has pseudo-prthuyasas, 
who claim to be varähamihira's son, in the horâsâra.1* pseudo 
paräsara (seventh or eighth century) has copy from the brhajjâtaka in 
the pürvakhanda of his brhatpäräsarahoräsästra,15 while kalyänavarman 
(c. a.d. 800) has use both the yavanajâtaka and the brhajjâtaka in the 
relevant verse of the särävali,16 an anonymous author cite by sivaräja 
(fifteenth century) in his jyotirnibandha17 and mantresvara (sixteenth 
century) in the phaladîpikâ18 rely on kalyänavarman, while gunäkara 
(fourteenth century?) in his horâmakaranda19 depend on both the 
brhajjâtaka and the sârâvalï. less important characterization of the 
planet can be found in the täjika20 of nilakantha (who finished the 
varsatantra in 1587) and the jâtakâbharana21 of dhundhiräja (who wrote 
in 1628). 
the most obvious dissimilarity between sphujidhvaja s verse and 
those of the later indian astrologer lie in the order of the planets. 
by the fourth century in india it had become an unbreakable rule that 
the planet must be name in the order of their lordship of the week 
days: sun, moon, mars, mercury, jupiter, venus, and saturn. sphujidh 
vaja was early enough to escape this law, and here arrange the planet

a.d. 1040/1041),29 and an unknown byzantine author.30 
related to this dorothean tradition are passage in ptolemy's (second 
century) tetrabiblo on the influence of the five star-planets on the bodies31 
and souls32 of native and in firmicu maternus' (fl. 334-337) ma thesis.'m 
both of these, however, contain addition to dorotheus' text, some of 
which are parallel in the yavanajätaka. some of these addition are 
also found attribute to pythagoras in some greece manuscripts,34 and 
in other they are incorporated in a long treatise which pretend to be 
derive from an egypt source.35 this "pythagorean" or "egyptian" 
text was combine with hephaestio's quotation from dorotheu by 
rhetoriu of egypt (early sixth century).36 outside of both these tradi 
tions, but to some extent similar to the "pythagorean", are two short 
documents, one ascribe to an unknown anatolius,37 the other tentative 
(and undoubted wrongly) to heliodorus.38 
finally, one must mention the planetary iconography in the temple of 
the "säbians" of harrän known from several description in arabic 
sources,39 as it was thought by saxl to preserve an ancient babylonian 
tradition.40 with this can also be compare the description of the 
planetary image of the "sipasians" in the dabistàn of moshan fäni.41

natives' activity and occupations, not their appearances or characters. similar to

who were associate with the planet 
describe as have been in harrä 
hellenistic characterization of the native born under the influence of 
the planet are in part borrowing from babylonian astrology, but we are 
not yet in a position to determine the extent of this influence. surely 
many particulars of the image supposedly erect by the "säbians" and 
"sipasians" and those describe elsewhere in islam source are derive 
from the indian tradition investigate in this paper. 
in the following page i give the more important sanskrit text and 
translate thereof. the words underline with a solid line in the 
vrddhayavanajdtaka, brhajjdtaka, laghujätaka, and särävali correspond 
to words in the yavanajdtaka; those italicize represent idea similar to 
those in the yavanajdtaka. in an appendix i list the parallel to the adjec 
tive of sphujidhvaja and satya which i have found in the hellenistic 
characterization of the native born under the influence of each planet. 
the planetary melothesia and dosa which appear in these text will be 
discuss in detail in my edition of the yavanajdtaka.
