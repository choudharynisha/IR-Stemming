the prophecies. 

the clergy have ever claim that the prophecy 

are divine revelation of event yet to occur, and have 

incessant agitate society by preach their speedy fulfillment, 

we propose to expose the fallacy of their teaching 

by showing that these scripture are not the record 

of future events, divine reavealed, but that they originate 

with the founder of astral worship, who predicate 

them upon predetermine event of their own concoction, 

relative to the general judgment, and setting up of the 

kingdom of heaven, which were to occur as the finale of 

the plan of redemption and from which were derive the 

doctrine of second adventism; and, in determine the 

exact time when then were to occur, we have but to prove 

that it was coincident with the conclusion of the last half 

of the grand cycle of 12,000 years, which, as we have 

shown, was dedicated to man as the duration of his race 

on earth. 

as evidence that the founder of the jewish or ancient 

christianity believed, like the votary of other form 

of astral worship, that the prophecy were soon to be fulfilled, 

we find that the new testament, of the original version 

of which they were the authors, is replete with such 

text as "repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand," 

matt. iv. 17; "there be some standing here which shall 

not taste death till they see the son of man coming in his 

kingdom," matt. xxi. 28; "the time is fulfilled, and the 

kingdom of god is at hand," mark i. 15. that the original 

version of the new testament was compose when the 

vernal equinox was in the sign of aries we are assured by 

reason of the fact that it inculcate homage to the lord 

under the symbol of the lamb; and that it was during the 

last, or 30th degree of that sign, can readily be proven by 

appealing to history and to astronomy, the former of which 

teach that the jew were remove from judea to alexandria 

twenty-five years before the accession to the throne 

of philadelphus, the second ptolemy, to whom we have 

refer in our preceding article, and who, after reign 

thirty-nine years, die 246 years before the beginning of 

our era. by reference to the celestial atlas we will find 

that the vernal equinox will pass out of the sign of pisces 

into that of aquarius, or in the year 1900, and we 

have but to deduct that period of time from 2150, the 

number of years require for the cardinal points to pass 

through one whole sign, to determine that the spring 

equinox pass out of the sign of aries into that of pisces 

250 years before the beginning of our era, or about 2,100 

years ago. now, from the projection of the astrology 

science, we are assured that the last half of the grand cycle 

of 12,000 years, which was allot to man as the duration 

of his race on earth, was made to begin at a time corresponding 

to the autumnal equinox, when that cardinal 

point was passing out of the sign of virgo, and that of necessity 

it had to come to an end at a time corresponding 

to the vernal equinox, when that cardinal point was passing 

out of the sign of aries; from which we know why, at 

the last judgment, the office of trumpet was assign to 

the archangel gabriel, the genius of spring, and why it 

was a ram's horn with which he was to "toot the crack o' 

doom." 

when the time arrive for the fulfillment of the prophecy 

we can well imagine that, fear the wrath of the 

lamb, there were weeping, wail and gnash of teeth 

among the terror-stricken sinners, while those who believe 

they had made their calling and election sure were 

look with feverish expectancy for the second advent of 

their lord and saviour; and, doubtless, clothe with their 

ascension robes, they watch and waited, with ear alert, 

to hear the sound of gabriel's trumpet, summon the 

quick, and the dead to the general judgment. but not a 

blast from the archangel's ram's horn was heard reverberate 

along the skies, no lord appear descend 

upon the cloud to meet the elect in the air, and, in the last 

act of the fearful drama of "judgment day," the curtain refuse 

to be rung down upon a burning world. 

with the non-fulfillment of the prophecies, the more 

enlightened elements of society began to scoff at the 

priests, who were temporary demoralized, but true to 

their deceptive instincts, soon rally with the plea of a 

mistake have been made in the calculation base upon 

the prophecies, they undoubted concoct scripture to 

meet that very emergency, for, to the taunt of the scoff 

who, in reference to the second advent of the lord, enquire 

"where is the sign of his coming? for, since the 

father fell asleep, all things continue as they were from 

the beginning of creation," they answer that "the lord 

is not slack concerning his promise," but "as a thief in the 

night" he would soon come and all things be fulfilled. see 

ii. peter, chapter iii. 

following up the history of this interesting subject, 

we find that the founder of modern christianity, to which 

we will refer in our next article, in compose their version 

of the new testament from that of the jewish, or ancient 

christians, made no change in its verbiage relative to the 

prophecies; but when constantine i., emperor of rome, 

became the patron of the church, her hierarchy, tired of 

figure upon them, secure a long respite from that troublesome 

subject by claim to have made other calculations, 

which put off the time of fulfillment to the year 1000; 

and from history we learn when the time arrive the whole 

of christendom was fearful agitate upon the subject: 

since then every generation has been vex with the fallacy 

of second adventism; and the fact of the case justify 

the charge that the clergy, by teaching that the prophecy 

refer to event yet to occur, are perpetuate a 

most stupendous fraud upon christendom, and an earnest 

and efficient protest should be inaugurate against the 

further agitation of the monstrous delusion of second adventism, 

which is frighten thousand of weak-minded 

people into insanity and cause a vast amount of social 

distress.
