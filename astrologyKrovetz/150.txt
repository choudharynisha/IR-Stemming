chapter iv. 

of the nature of the seven planet and of their 

essential and accidental dignity 

of the seven planet jupiter and venus, because of the heat and 

moisture predominant in them, are considered by the ancients as 

benefic or cause of good. the moon is so considered for the same 

reasons, though in a less degree. 

saturn and mars are cause of evil or malefic; the first from his 

excess of cold, and the other from his excess of heat. the sun and 

mercury are deem of common influence—that is, either of good or 

evil, according to the planet with which they are connected. 

the planet have particular familiarity with certain place in the 

zodiac by means of parts designate as their houses, and also by their 

triplicities, exaltation and terms. 

the nature of their familiarity by house is as follows:— 

cancer and leo are the most northerly of all the twelve signs; they 

approach near than the other sign to the zenith of this part of the 

earth, and thereby cause warmth and heat; they are consequently 

appropriate as house for the two principal and greater luminaries; 

leo for the sun, as being masculine; and cancer for the moon, as being 

feminine. 

saturn, since he is cold and inimical to heat, moving also in a 

superior orbit most remote from the luminaries, occupy the sign 

opposite to cancer and leo; these are aquarius and capricorn, and they 

are assign to him in consideration of their cold and wintry nature. 

jupiter has a favourable temperament, and is situated beneath the 

sphere of saturn; he, therefore, occupy the next two signs, 

sagittarius and pisces. 

mars is dry in nature and beneath the sphere of jupiter; he take the 

next two signs, of a nature similar to his own, viz., aries and 

scorpio, whose relative distance from the house of the luminary are 

injurious and discordant. 

venus, possess a favourable temperament, and, placed beneath the 

sphere of mars, take the next two signs, taurus and libra. these are 

of a fruitful nature and preserve harmony by the sextile distance; this 

planet is never more than two sign distant from the sun. 

mercury never has greater distance from the sun than the space of one 

sign, and is beneath all the other planets; hence he is nearest to both 

luminaries, and the remain two signs, gemini and virgo, are allot 

to him. 

the "houses" of the planet are readily shown by the following table. 

it is exactly the same as that found in the mummy-case of the archon of 

thebes, in ancient egypt, as may be seen at the britain museum: 























it will be seen, at once, from this table that the sun and moon have 

each only one house assign them. all planet are most powerful in 

that sign which constitute one of their houses. planet receive 

detriment in the sign opposite to those of their houses. thus, saturn 

would receive detriment in cancer and leo, which are the sign opposite 

to his houses, capricornu and aquarius. there are some sign in which 

the planet are found to be very powerful, though not to the same 

extent as when in their own houses; these are call the "exaltations" 

of the planets, and the sign opposite to these are those in which they 

receive their "fall" when they are considered to be weak in power. 

saturn has his exaltation in libra; his "fall" would therefore be in 

aries. he govern the airy triplicity, which is compose of the sign 

gemini, libra and aquarius by day, and in all the twelve sign he has 

these degree (zodiacal signs) allot him by ptolemy for his terms: 

in aries 

27, 28, 29, 30. 

in taurus 

23, 24, 25, 26. 

in gemini 

22, 23, 24, 25. 

in cancer 

28, 29, 30. 

in leo 

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

in aquarius 

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 

in pisces

the meaning of which is that if saturn should rise in any of these 

degree it is a sign that he is not void of essential dignities; or, if 

he is posit in any of the following degree (which he is allow for 

his face or decanate) he is still not devoid of dignities. this is to 

be understood of all the planets.
