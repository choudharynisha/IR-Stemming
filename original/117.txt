CHAPTER XIII

They told me, by the sentence of the law,

They had commission to seize all thy fortune.

Here stood a ruffian with a horrid face,

Lording it o’er a pile of massy plate,

Tumbled into a heap for public sale;

There was another, making villainous jests

At thy undoing; he had ta’en possession

Of all thy ancient most domestic ornaments.

OTWAY.

Early next morning Mannering mounted his horse and, accompanied by his

servant, took the road to Ellangowan. He had no need to inquire the way. A

sale in the country is a place of public resort and amusement, and people

of various descriptions streamed to it from all quarters.

After a pleasant ride of about an hour, the old towers of the ruin

presented themselves in the landscape. The thoughts, with what different

feelings he had lost sight of them so many years before, thronged upon the

mind of the traveller. The landscape was the same; but how changed the

feelings, hopes, and views of the spectator! Then life and love were new,

and all the prospect was gilded by their rays. And now, disappointed in

affection, sated with fame and what the world calls success, his mind,

goaded by bitter and repentant recollection, his best hope was to find a

retirement in which he might nurse the melancholy that was to accompany

him to his grave. ‘Yet why should an individual mourn over the instability

of his hopes and the vanity of his prospects? The ancient chiefs who

erected these enormous and massive towers to be the fortress of their race

and the seat of their power,--could they have dreamed the day was to come

when the last of their descendants should be expelled, a ruined wanderer,

from his possessions! But Nature’s bounties are unaltered. The sun will

shine as fair on these ruins, whether the property of a stranger or of a

sordid and obscure trickster of the abused law, as when the banners of the

founder first waved upon their battlements.’

These reflections brought Mannering to the door of the house, which was

that day open to all. He entered among others, who traversed the

apartments, some to select articles for purchase, others to gratify their

curiosity. There is something melancholy in such a scene, even under the

most favourable circumstances. The confused state of the furniture,

displaced for the convenience of being easily viewed and carried off by

the purchasers, is disagreeable to the eye. Those articles which, properly

and decently arranged, look creditable and handsome, have then a paltry

and wretched appearance; and the apartments, stripped of all that render

them commodious and comfortable, have an aspect of ruin and dilapidation.

It is disgusting also to see the scenes of domestic society and seclusion

thrown open to the gaze of the curious and the vulgar, to hear their

coarse speculations and brutal jests upon the fashions and furniture to

which they are unaccustomed,--a frolicsome humour much cherished by the

whisky which in Scotland is always put in circulation on such occasions.

All these are ordinary effects of such a scene as Ellangowan now

presented; but the moral feeling, that in this case they indicated the

total ruin of an ancient and honourable family, gave them treble weight

and poignancy.

It was some time before Colonel Mannering could find any one disposed to

answer his reiterated questions concerning Ellangowan himself. At length

an old maidservant, who held her apron to her eyes as she spoke, told him

‘the Laird was something better, and they hoped he would be able to leave

the house that day. Miss Lucy expected the chaise every moment, and, as

the day was fine for the time o’year, they had carried him in his

easychair up to the green before the auld castle, to be out of the way of

this unco spectacle.’ Thither Colonel Mannering went in quest of him, and

soon came in sight of the little group, which consisted of four persons.

The ascent was steep, so that he had time to reconnoitre them as he

advanced, and to consider in what mode he should make his address.

Mr. Bertram, paralytic and almost incapable of moving, occupied his

easy-chair, attired in his nightcap and a loose camlet coat, his feet

wrapped in blankets. Behind him, with his hands crossed on the cane upon

which he rested, stood Dominie Sampson, whom Mannering recognised at once.

Time had made no change upon him, unless that his black coat seemed more

brown, and his gaunt cheeks more lank, than when Mannering last saw him.

On one side of the old man was a sylph-like form--a young woman of about

seventeen, whom the Colonel accounted to be his daughter. She was looking

from time to time anxiously towards the avenue, as if expecting the

post-chaise; and between whiles busied herself in adjusting the blankets

so as to protect her father from the cold, and in answering inquiries,

which he seemed to make with a captious and querulous manner. She did not

trust herself to look towards the Place, although the hum of the assembled

crowd must have drawn her attention in that direction. The fourth person

of the group was a handsome and genteel young man, who seemed to share

Miss Bertram’s anxiety, and her solicitude to soothe and accommodate her

parent.

This young man was the first who observed Colonel Mannering, and

immediately stepped forward to meet him, as if politely to prevent his

drawing nearer to the distressed group. Mannering instantly paused and

explained. ‘He was,’ he said, ‘a stranger to whom Mr. Bertram had formerly

shown kindness and hospitality; he would not have intruded himself upon

him at a period of distress, did it not seem to be in some degree a moment

also of desertion; he wished merely to offer such services as might be in

his power to Mr. Bertram and the young lady.’

He then paused at a little distance from the chair. His old acquaintance

gazed at him with lack-lustre eye, that intimated no tokens of

recognition; the Dominie seemed too deeply sunk in distress even to

observe his presence. The young man spoke aside with Miss Bertram, who

advanced timidly, and thanked Colonel Mannering for his goodness; ‘but,’

she said, the tears gushing fast into her eyes, ‘her father, she feared,

was not so much himself as to be able to remember him.’

She then retreated towards the chair, accompanied by the Colonel.

‘Father,’ she said, ‘this is Mr. Mannering, an old friend, come to inquire

after you.’

‘He’s very heartily welcome,’ said the old man, raising himself in his

chair, and attempting a gesture of courtesy, while a gleam of hospitable

satisfaction seemed to pass over his faded features; ‘but, Lucy, my dear,

let us go down to the house; you should not keep the gentleman here in the

cold. Dominie, take the key of the wine-cooler. Mr. a--a--the gentleman

will surely take something after his ride.’

Mannering was unspeakably affected by the contrast which his recollection

made between this reception and that with which he had been greeted by the

same individual when they last met. He could not restrain his tears, and

his evident emotion at once attained him the confidence of the friendless

young lady.

‘Alas!’ she said, ‘this is distressing even to a stranger; but it may be

better for my poor father to be in this way than if he knew and could feel

all.’

A servant in livery now came up the path, and spoke in an undertone to the

young gentleman--’Mr. Charles, my lady’s wanting you yonder sadly, to bid

for her for the black ebony cabinet; and Lady Jean Devorgoil is wi’ her

an’ a’; ye maun come away directly.’

‘Tell them you could not find me, Tom, or, stay,--say I am looking at the

horses.’

‘No, no, no,’ said Lucy Bertram, earnestly; ‘if you would not add to the

misery of this miserable moment, go to the company directly. This

gentleman, I am sure, will see us to the carriage.’

‘Unquestionably, madam,’ said Mannering, ‘your young friend may rely on my

attention.’

‘Farewell, then,’ said young Hazlewood, and whispered a word in her ear;

then ran down the steep hastily, as if not trusting his resolution at a

slower pace.

‘Where’s Charles Hazlewood running?’ said the invalid, who apparently was

accustomed to his presence and attentions; ‘where’s Charles Hazlewood

running? what takes him away now?’

‘He’ll return in a little while,’ said Lucy, gently.

The sound of voices was now heard from the ruins. The reader may remember

there was a communication between the castle and the beach, up which the

speakers had ascended.

‘Yes, there’s a plenty of shells and seaware for manure, as you observe;

and if one inclined to build a new house, which might indeed be necessary,

there’s a great deal of good hewn stone about this old dungeon, for the

devil here--’

‘Good God!’ said Miss Bertram hastily to Sampson, ‘‘t is that wretch

Glossin’s voice! If my father sees him, it will kill him outright!’

Sampson wheeled perpendicularly round, and moved with long strides to

confront the attorney as he issued from beneath the portal arch of the

ruin. ‘Avoid ye!’ he said, ‘avoid ye! wouldst thou kill and take

possession?’

‘Come, come, Master Dominie Sampson,’ answered Glossin insolently, ‘if ye

cannot preach in the pulpit, we’ll have no preaching here. We go by the

law, my good friend; we leave the gospel to you.’

The very mention of this man’s name had been of late a subject of the most

violent irritation to the unfortunate patient. The sound of his voice now

produced an instantaneous effect. Mr. Bertram started up without

assistance and turned round towards him; the ghastliness of his features

forming a strange contrast with the violence of his exclamations.--’Out of

my sight, ye viper! ye frozen viper, that I warmed, till ye stung me! Art

thou not afraid that the walls of my father’s dwelling should fall and

crush thee limb and bone? Are ye not afraid the very lintels of the door

of Ellangowan Castle should break open and swallow you up? Were ye not

friendless, houseless, penniless, when I took ye by the hand; and are ye

not expelling me--me and that innocent girl--friendless, houseless, and

penniless, from the house that has sheltered us and ours for a thousand

years?’

Had Glossin been alone, he would probably have slunk off; but the

consciousness that a stranger was present, besides the person who came

with him (a sort of land-surveyor), determined him to resort to impudence.

The task, however, was almost too hard even for his

effrontery--’Sir--sir--Mr. Bertram, sir, you should not blame me, but your

own imprudence, sir--’
