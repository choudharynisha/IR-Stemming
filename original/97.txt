THE PROPHECIES.

The clergy having ever claimed that the prophecies

are Divine revelations of events yet to occur, and having

incessantly agitated society by preaching their speedy fulfillment,

we propose to expose the fallacy of their teachings

by showing that these scriptures are not the records

of future events, Divinely reavealed, but that they originated

with the founders of Astral worship, who predicated

them upon predetermined events of their own concoction,

relative to the general judgment, and setting up of the

kingdom of heaven, which were to occur as the finale of

the plan of redemption and from which were derived the

doctrines of second adventism; and, in determining the

exact time when then were to occur, we have but to prove

that it was coincident with the conclusion of the last half

of the grand cycle of 12,000 years, which, as we have

shown, was dedicated to man as the duration of his race

on earth.

As evidence that the founders of the Jewish or ancient

Christianity believed, like the votaries of other forms

of Astral worship, that the prophecies were soon to be fulfilled,

we find that the New Testament, of the original version

of which they were the authors, is replete with such

texts as "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,"

Matt. iv. 17; "There be some standing here which shall

not taste death till they see the Son of Man coming in His

kingdom," Matt. xxi. 28; "The time is fulfilled, and the

Kingdom of God is at hand," Mark i. 15. That the original

version of the New Testament was composed when the

Vernal Equinox was in the sign of Aries we are assured by

reason of the fact that it inculcates homage to the Lord

under the symbol of the Lamb; and that it was during the

last, or 30th degree of that sign, can readily be proven by

appealing to history and to astronomy, the former of which

teaches that the Jews were removed from Judea to Alexandria

twenty-five years before the accession to the throne

of Philadelphus, the Second Ptolemy, to whom we have

referred in our preceding article, and who, after reigning

thirty-nine years, died 246 years before the beginning of

our era. By reference to the Celestial atlas we will find

that the Vernal Equinox will pass out of the sign of Pisces

into that of Aquarius, or in the year 1900, and we

have but to deduct that period of time from 2150, the

number of years required for the cardinal points to pass

through one whole sign, to determine that the Spring

Equinox passed out of the sign of Aries into that of Pisces

250 years before the beginning of our era, or about 2,100

years ago. Now, from the projections of the astrological

science, we are assured that the last half of the grand cycle

of 12,000 years, which was allotted to man as the duration

of his race on earth, was made to begin at a time corresponding

to the Autumnal Equinox, when that cardinal

point was passing out of the sign of Virgo, and that of necessity

it had to come to an end at a time corresponding

to the Vernal Equinox, when that cardinal point was passing

out of the sign of Aries; from which we know why, at

the last judgment, the office of trumpeter was assigned to

the Archangel Gabriel, the genius of Spring, and why it

was a ram's horn with which he was to "toot the crack o'

doom."

When the time arrived for the fulfillment of the prophecies

we can well imagine that, fearing the wrath of the

Lamb, there were weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth

among the terror-stricken sinners, while those who believed

they had made their calling and election sure were

looking with feverish expectancy for the second advent of

their Lord and Saviour; and, doubtless, clothed with their

ascension robes, they watched and waited, with ears alert,

to hear the sound of Gabriel's trumpet, summoning the

quick, and the dead to the general judgment. But not a

blast from the archangel's ram's horn was heard reverberating

along the skies, no Lord appeared descending

upon the clouds to meet the elect in the air, and, in the last

act of the fearful drama of "judgment day," the curtain refused

to be rung down upon a burning world.

With the non-fulfillment of the prophecies, the more

enlightened elements of society began to scoff at the

priests, who were temporarily demoralized, but true to

their deceptive instincts, soon rallying with the plea of a

mistake having been made in the calculations based upon

the prophecies, they undoubtedly concocted scripture to

meet that very emergency, for, to the taunts of the scoffers

who, in reference to the second advent of the Lord, enquired

"Where is the sign of His coming? for, since the

fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from

the beginning of creation," they answered that "The Lord

is not slack concerning His promise," but "as a thief in the

night" he would soon come and all things be fulfilled. See

II. Peter, chapter iii.

Following up the history of this interesting subject,

we find that the founders of modern Christianity, to which

we will refer in our next article, in composing their version

of the New Testament from that of the Jewish, or ancient

Christians, made no change in its verbiage relative to the

prophecies; but when Constantine I., Emperor of Rome,

became the patron of the church, her hierarchy, tired of

figuring upon them, secured a long respite from that troublesome

subject by claiming to have made other calculations,

which put off the time of fulfillment to the year 1000;

and from history we learn when the time arrived the whole

of Christendom was fearfully agitated upon the subject:

Since then every generation has been vexed with the fallacies

of second adventism; and the facts of the case justify

the charge that the clergy, by teaching that the prophecies

refer to events yet to occur, are perpetuating a

most stupendous fraud upon Christendom, and an earnest

and efficient protest should be inaugurated against the

further agitation of the monstrous delusion of second adventism,

which is frightening thousands of weak-minded

people into insanity and causing a vast amount of social

distress.
