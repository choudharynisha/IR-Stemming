CHAPTER XIV

The bell strikes one. We take no note of time

But from its loss. To give it then a tongue

Is wise in man. As if an angel spoke,

I feel the solemn sound.

YOUNG.

The moral which the poet has rather quaintly deduced from the necessary

mode of measuring time may be well applied to our feelings respecting that

portion of it which constitutes human life. We observe the aged, the

infirm, and those engaged in occupations of immediate hazard, trembling as

it were upon the very brink of non-existence, but we derive no lesson from

the precariousness of their tenure until it has altogether failed. Then,

for a moment at least--

Our hopes and fears Start up alarm’d, and o’er life’s narrow verge

Look down--on what? a fathomless abyss, A dark eternity, how surely

ours!

The crowd of assembled gazers and idlers at Ellangowan had followed the

views of amusement, or what they called business, which brought them

there, with little regard to the feelings of those who were suffering upon

that occasion. Few, indeed, knew anything of the family. The father,

betwixt seclusion, misfortune, and imbecility, had drifted, as it were,

for many years out of the notice of his contemporaries; the daughter had

never been known to them. But when the general murmur announced that the

unfortunate Mr. Bertram had broken his heart in the effort to leave the

mansion of his forefathers, there poured forth a torrent of sympathy like

the waters from the rock when stricken by the wand of the prophet. The

ancient descent and unblemished integrity of the family were respectfully

remembered; above all, the sacred veneration due to misfortune, which in

Scotland seldom demands its tribute in vain, then claimed and received it.

Mr. Mac-Morlan hastily announced that he would suspend all farther

proceedings in the sale of the estate and other property, and relinquish

the possession of the premises to the young lady, until she could consult

with her friends and provide for the burial of her father.

Glossin had cowered for a few minutes under the general expression of

sympathy, till, hardened by observing that no appearance of popular

indignation was directed his way, he had the audacity to require that the

sale should proceed.

‘I will take it upon my own authority to adjourn it,’ said the

Sheriff-substitute, ‘and will be responsible for the consequences. I will

also give due notice when it is again to go forward. It is for the benefit

of all concerned that the lands should bring the highest price the state

of the market will admit, and this is surely no time to expect it. I will

take the responsibility upon myself.’

Glossin left the room and the house too with secrecy and despatch; and it

was probably well for him that he did so, since our friend Jock Jabos was

already haranguing a numerous tribe of bare-legged boys on the propriety

of pelting him off the estate.

Some of the rooms were hastily put in order for the reception of the young

lady, and of her father’s dead body. Mannering now found his farther

interference would be unnecessary, and might be misconstrued. He observed,

too, that several families connected with that of Ellangowan, and who

indeed derived their principal claim of gentility from the alliance, were

now disposed to pay to their trees of genealogy a tribute which the

adversity of their supposed relatives had been inadequate to call forth;

and that the honour of superintending the funeral rites of the dead

Godfrey Bertram (as in the memorable case of Homer’s birthplace) was

likely to be debated by seven gentlemen of rank and fortune, none of whom

had offered him an asylum while living. He therefore resolved, as his

presence was altogether useless, to make a short tour of a fortnight, at

the end of which period the adjourned sale of the estate of Ellangowan was

to proceed.

But before he departed he solicited an interview with the Dominie. The

poor man appeared, on being informed a gentleman wanted to speak to him,

with some expression of surprise in his gaunt features, to which recent

sorrow had given an expression yet more grisly. He made two or three

profound reverences to Mannering, and then, standing erect, patiently

waited an explanation of his commands.

‘You are probably at a loss to guess, Mr. Sampson,’ said Mannering, ‘what

a stranger may have to say to you?’

‘Unless it were to request that I would undertake to train up some youth

in polite letters and humane learning; but I cannot--I cannot; I have yet

a task to perform.’

‘No, Mr. Sampson, my wishes are not so ambitious. I have no son, and my

only daughter, I presume, you would not consider as a fit pupil.’

‘Of a surety no,’ replied the simple-minded Sampson. ‘Nathless, it was I

who did educate Miss Lucy in all useful learning, albeit it was the

housekeeper who did teach her those unprofitable exercises of hemming and

shaping.’

‘Well, sir,’ replied Mannering, ‘it is of Miss Lucy I meant to speak. You

have, I presume, no recollection of me?’

Sampson, always sufficiently absent in mind, neither remembered the

astrologer of past years, nor even the stranger who had taken his patron’s

part against Glossin, so much had his friend’s sudden death embroiled his

ideas.

‘Well, that does not signify,’ pursued the Colonel; ‘I am an old

acquaintance of the late Mr. Bertram, able and willing to assist his

daughter in her present circumstances. Besides, I have thoughts of making

this purchase, and I should wish things kept in order about the place;

will you have the goodness to apply this small sum in the usual family

expenses?’ He put into the Dominie’s hand a purse containing some gold.

‘Pro-di-gi-ous!’ exclaimed Dominie Sampson. ‘But if your honour would

tarry--’

‘Impossible, sir, impossible,’ said Mannering, making his escape from him.

‘Pro-di-gi-ous!’ again exclaimed Sampson, following to the head of the

stairs, still holding out the purse. ‘But as touching this coined money--’

Mannering escaped downstairs as fast as possible.

‘Pro-di-gi-ous!’ exclaimed Dominie Sampson, yet the third time, now

standing at the front door. ‘But as touching this specie--’

But Mannering was now on horseback, and out of hearing. The Dominie, who

had never, either in his own right or as trustee for another, been

possessed of a quarter part of this sum, though it was not above twenty

guineas, ‘took counsel,’ as he expressed himself, ‘how he should demean

himself with respect unto the fine gold’ thus left in his charge.

Fortunately he found a disinterested adviser in Mac-Morlan, who pointed

out the most proper means of disposing of it for contributing to Miss

Bertram’s convenience, being no doubt the purpose to which it was destined

by the bestower.

Many of the neighbouring gentry were now sincerely eager in pressing

offers of hospitality and kindness upon Miss Bertram. But she felt a

natural reluctance to enter any family for the first time as an object

rather of benevolence than hospitality, and determined to wait the opinion

and advice of her father’s nearest female relation, Mrs. Margaret Bertram

of Singleside, an old unmarried lady, to whom she wrote an account of her

present distressful situation.

The funeral of the late Mr. Bertram was performed with decent privacy, and

the unfortunate young lady was now to consider herself as but the

temporary tenant of the house in which she had been born, and where her

patience and soothing attentions had so long ‘rocked the cradle of

declining age.’ Her communication with Mr. Mac-Morlan encouraged her to

hope that she would not be suddenly or unkindly deprived of this asylum;

but fortune had ordered otherwise.

For two days before the appointed day for the sale of the lands and estate

of Ellangowan, Mac-Morlan daily expected the appearance of Colonel

Mannering, or at least a letter containing powers to act for him. But none

such arrived. Mr. Mac-Morlan waked early in the morning, walked over to

the Post-office,--there were no letters for him. He endeavoured to

persuade himself that he should see Colonel Mannering to breakfast, and

ordered his wife to place her best china and prepare herself accordingly.

But the preparations were in vain. ‘Could I have foreseen this,’ he said,

‘I would have travelled Scotland over, but I would have found some one to

bid against Glossin.’ Alas! such reflections were all too late. The

appointed hour arrived; and the parties met in the Masons’ Lodge at

Kippletringan, being the place fixed for the adjourned sale. Mac-Morlan

spent as much time in preliminaries as decency would permit, and read over

the articles of sale as slowly as if he had been reading his own

death-warrant. He turned his eye every time the door of the room opened,

with hopes which grew fainter and fainter. He listened to every noise in

the street of the village, and endeavoured to distinguish in it the sound

of hoofs or wheels. It was all in vain. A bright idea then occurred, that

Colonel Mannering might have employed some other person in the

transaction; he would not have wasted a moment’s thought upon the want of

confidence in himself which such a manoeuvre would have evinced. But this

hope also was groundless. After a solemn pause, Mr. Glossin offered the

upset price for the lands and barony of Ellangowan. No reply was made, and

no competitor appeared; so, after a lapse of the usual interval by the

running of a sand-glass, upon the intended purchaser entering the proper

sureties, Mr. Mac-Morlan was obliged, in technical terms, to ‘find and

declare the sale lawfully completed, and to prefer the said Gilbert

Glossin as the purchaser of the said lands and estate.’ The honest writer

refused to partake of a splendid entertainment with which Gilbert Glossin,

Esquire, now of Ellangowan, treated the rest of the company, and returned

home in huge bitterness of spirit, which he vented in complaints against

the fickleness and caprice of these Indian nabobs, who never knew what

they would be at for ten days together. Fortune generously determined to

take the blame upon herself, and cut off even this vent of Mac-Morlan’s

resentment.

An express arrived about six o’clock at night, ‘very particularly drunk,’

the maid-servant said, with a packet from Colonel Mannering, dated four

days back, at a town about a hundred miles’ distance from Kippletringan,

containing full powers to Mr. Mac-Morlan, or any one whom he might employ,

to make the intended purchase, and stating that some family business of

consequence called the Colonel himself to Westmoreland, where a letter

would find him, addressed to the care of Arthur Mervyn, Esq., of Mervyn

Hall.

Mac-Morlan, in the transports of his wrath, flung the power of attorney at

the head of the innocent maidservant, and was only forcibly withheld from

horse-whipping the rascally messenger by whose sloth and drunkenness the

disappointment had taken place.
