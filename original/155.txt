CHAPTER X.

OF THE EFFECT OF EACH PLANET IN EACH OF THE TWELVE HOUSES

Saturn in the first house, or ascendant, shows melancholy and many

sorrows, and if near the ascendant probability of early death; in the

second house pecuniary troubles; in the third quarrels with brothers

and sisters, and dangers and losses in travelling; in the fourth house

death of father or mother, and loss of friends; in the fifth barrenness

or death of children; in the sixth illness, worries with servants and

losses from cattle; in the seventh an ungovernable wife and unhappy

marriage; in the eighth violent death and loss of legacies; in the

ninth losses by sea; in the tenth dishonour and imprisonment; in the

eleventh deep depression and false friends; in the twelfth sorrow,

trouble and persecution from secret enemies. If the planet is

strong—that is, well-dignified—these evils are much lessened.

Jupiter in the first house gives a good, happy and long life; in the

second riches; in the third family affection and fortunate short

journeys; in the fourth lands and inheritance with an honourable life

and end; in the fifth many children who are good and affectionate; in

the sixth faithful servants and fortunate dealings respecting cattle;

in the seventh honourable marriage; in the eighth long life and natural

death; in the ninth profitable sea voyages; in the tenth preferment and

honours; in the eleventh faithful friends; in the twelfth victory over

secret enemies. This, of course, means when the planet is strong in

dignities; if weak the good will be somewhat abated.

Mars in the first house shows shortness of life and scars on the head

or face; in the second poverty and troubles; in the third quarrels with

kindred and dangers in travelling; in the fourth short life to the

fathers; in the fifth disobedient children; in the sixth fevers, bad

servants, and loss of cattle; in the seventh sensuality and unhappiness

in marriage; in the eighth a violent death; in the ninth irreligion and

losses at sea; in the tenth military preferment, but troubles from

great dignitaries; in the eleventh false friends and loss of money; in

the twelfth imprisonment. This is when Mars is afflicted, but if

well-aspected these evils are somewhat abated.

The Sun in the first house gives honour, glory, and long life; in the

second much riches, but great extravagance; in the third good brethren

and fortunate journeys; in the fourth a noble inheritance and honours

in old age; in the fifth few children, yet such as will be a comfort;

in the sixth diseases of the mind; in the seventh a good wife,

honourable adversaries, and sickness; in the eighth good dowry with the

wife, but danger of a violent death; in the ninth gain by the sea, and

ecclesiastical dignities; in the tenth gain from princes and noble

women; in the eleventh distinguished friendships; in the twelfth

powerful adversaries. This is if the Sun is well-dignified; if weak the

good fortune is not so pronounced.

Venus in the first house gives good health, but sensuality as regards

the opposite sex; in the second riches by means of women; in the third,

in a woman's horoscope, by means of lovers above her in rank; in the

fourth inheritance; in the fifth many children; in the sixth illness

from excesses; in the seventh a good and beautiful wife and very few

enemies; in the eighth a good dowry with the wife and a natural death;

in the ninth good fortune by sea; in the tenth honour and preferment

through the means of some one of the opposite sex; in the eleventh

sympathetic friends; in the twelfth freedom from the power of private

enemies. This if Venus be strong; if weak the good fortune is less

pronounced.

Mercury in the first house gives noble thoughts, graceful elocution,

and love of art and science; in the second profit by intellectual work;

in the third mathematical skill, swift and prosperous journeys; in the

fourth the gain of an inheritance by craftiness; in the fifth clever

children; in the sixth thieving servants and diseases of the brain; in

the seventh a fomenter of quarrels, but a discreet wife; in the eighth

death by consumption; in the ninth wonderful ability, especially in

occult matters; in the tenth much preferment for ability; in the

eleventh inconstant friends; in the twelfth secret enemies, but they

will not much affect the destiny. This is when Mercury is

well-dignified. If weak the good fortune is much lessened.

The Moon in the ascendant, or first house, shows the native will travel

and will gain the favour of noble persons; in the second she sometimes

gives unstable fortune, riches, and poverty alternately; in the third

long journeys; in the fourth profit by travelling; in the fifth many

children; in the sixth diseases of the brain, but good servants; in the

seventh honourable marriage; in the eighth danger by drowning, but

otherwise a long and healthy life; in the ninth many long sea voyages,

inconstancy in religion, and love of art; in the tenth great honours;

in the eleventh the friendship of noble personages; in the twelfth the

common people will be the native's enemies and do him much wrong.

The Dragon's Head when posited in the first house shows poverty; in the

second a good estate; in the third honest kindred and fortunate

journeys; in the fourth gain by travels; in the fifth long life and

good children; in the sixth health and good servants; in the seventh a

virtuous wife; in the eighth many legacies and a natural death; in the

ninth prosperity at sea; in the tenth honour; in the eleventh faithful

friends; in the twelfth open enemies.

The Dragon's Tail in the same places signifies the contrary in all

things.
