Chaucer’s Astronomy

Chaucer’s treatment of astronomical lore in his poetry differs much from

his use of it in his prose writings. In poetical allusions to heavenly

phenomena, much attention to detail and a pedantic regard for accuracy

would be inappropriate. References to astronomy in Chaucer’s poetry are,

as a rule rather brief, specific but not technical, often purely

conventional but always truly poetic. There are, indeed, occasional

passages in Chaucer’s poetry showing so detailed a knowledge of

observational[50] astronomy that they would seem astonishing and, to many

people, out of place, in modern poetry. They were not so in Chaucer’s

time, when the exigencies of practical life demanded of the ordinary man a

knowledge of astronomy far surpassing that possessed by most of our

contemporaries. Harry Bailly in the Introduction to the Man of Lawes

Tale determines the day of the month and hour of the day by making

calculations from the observed position of the sun in the sky, and from

the length of shadows, although, says Chaucer, “he were not depe expert in

lore.”[51] Such [Pg 28]references to technical details of astronomy as we find

in this passage are, however, not common in Chaucer’s poetry; in his

Treatise on the Astrolabe, on the other hand, a professedly scientific

work designed to instruct his young son Louis in those elements of

astronomy and astrology that were necessary for learning the use of the

astrolabe, we have sufficient evidence that he was thoroughly familiar

with the technical details of the astronomical science of his day.

In Chaucer’s poetry the astronomical references employed are almost wholly

of two kinds: references showing the time of day or season of the year at

which the events narrated are supposed to take place; and figurative

allusions for purposes of illustration or comparison. Figurative uses of

astronomy in Chaucer vary from simple similes as in the Prologue to the

Canterbury Tales, where the friar’s eyes are compared to twinkling

stars[52] to extended allegories like the Compleynt of Mars in which the

myth of Venus and Mars is related by describing the motions of the planets

Venus and Mars for a certain period during which Venus overtakes Mars,

they are in conjunction[53] for a short time, and then Venus because of

her greater apparent velocity leaves Mars behind. One of the most

magnificent astronomical figures employed by Chaucer is in the Hous of[Pg 29]

Fame. Chaucer looks up into the heavens and sees a great golden eagle

near the sun, a sight so splendid that men could never have beheld its

equal ‘unless the heaven had won another sun:’

“Hit was of golde, and shone so bright,

That never saw men such a sighte,

But-if the heven hadde y-wonne

Al newe of golde another sonne;

So shoon the egles fethres brighte,

And somwhat dounward gan hit lighte.”[54]

Besides mentioning the heavenly bodies in time references and figurative

allusions, Chaucer also employs them often in descriptions of day and

night, of dawn and twilight, and of the seasons. It is with a poet’s joy

in the warm spring sun that he writes:

“Bright was the day, and blew the firmament,

Phebus of gold his stremes doun hath sent,

To gladen every flour with his warmnesse.”[55]

and with a poet’s delight in the new life and vigor that nature puts forth

when spring comes that he writes the lines:

“Forgeten had the erthe his pore estat

Of winter, that him naked made and mat,

And with his swerd of cold so sore greved;

Now hath the atempre sonne al that releved

That naked was, and clad hit new agayn.”[56]

Chaucer’s astronomical allusions, then, except in the Treatise on the

Astrolabe and in his translation of Boethius de Consolatione

Philosophiae, in which a philosophical interest in celestial phenomena is

displayed, are almost [Pg 30]invariably employed with poetic purpose. These

poetical allusions to heavenly phenomena, however, together with the more

technical and detailed references in Chaucer’s prose works give evidence

of a rather extensive knowledge of astronomy. With all of the important

observed movements of the heavenly bodies he was perfectly familiar and it

is rather remarkable how many of these he uses in his poetry without

giving one the feeling that he is airing his knowledge.

 

1. The Sun

Of all the heavenly bodies the one most often mentioned and employed for

poetic purposes by Chaucer is the sun. Chaucer has many epithets for the

sun, but speaks of him perhaps most often in the classical manner as

Phebus or Apollo. He is called the “golden tressed Phebus”[57] or the

“laurer-crowned Phebus;”[58] and when he makes Mars flee from Venus’

palace he is called the “candel of Ielosye.”[59] In the following passage

Chaucer uses three different epithets for the sun within two lines:

“The dayes honour, and the hevenes ye,

The nightes fo, al this clepe I the sonne,

Gan westren faste, and dounward for to wrye,

As he that hadde his dayes cours y-ronne;”[60]

Sometimes Chaucer gives the sun the various accessories with which

classical myth had endowed him—the four swift steeds, the rosy chariot

and fiery torches:

“And Phebus with his rosy carte sone

Gan after that to dresse him up to fare.”[61]“‘now am I war

That Pirous and tho swifte stedes three,

Which that drawen forth the sonnes char,[Pg 31]Hath goon some by-path in despyt of me;’”[62]

“Phebus, that was comen hastely

Within the paleys-yates sturdely,

With torche in honde, of which the stremes brighte

On Venus chambre knokkeden ful lighte.”[63]

Almost always when Chaucer wishes to mention the time of day at which the

events he is relating take place, he does so by describing the sun’s

position in the sky or the direction of his motion. We can imagine that

Chaucer often smiled as he did this, for he sometimes humorously

apologizes for his poetical conceits and conventions by expressing his

idea immediately afterwards in perfectly plain terms. Such is the case in

the passage already quoted where Chaucer refers to the sun by the epithets

“dayes honour,” “hevenes ye,” and “nightes fo” and then explains them by

saying “al this clepe I the sonne;” and in the lines:

“Til that the brighte sonne loste his hewe;

For thorisonte hath reft the sonne his light;”

explained by the simple words:

“This is as muche to seye as it was night.”[64]

Thus it is that Chaucer’s poetic references to the apparent daily motion

of the sun about the earth are nearly always simply in the form of

allusions to his rising and setting. Canacee in the Squieres Tale, (F.

384 ff.) is said to rise at dawn, looking as bright and fresh as the

spring sun risen four degrees from the horizon.

“Up ryseth fresshe Canacee hir-selve,

As rody and bright as dooth the yonge sonne,

That in the Ram[65] is four degrees up-ronne;

Noon hyer was he, whan she redy was;”

Many of these references to the rising and setting of the sun might be

mentioned, if space permitted, simply for their beauty as poetry. One of

the most beautiful is the following:

[Pg 32]

“And fyry Phebus ryseth up so brighte,

That al the orient laugheth of the lighte,

And with his stremes dryeth in the greves

The silver dropes, hanging on the leves.”[66]

When, in the Canterbury Tales, the manciple has finished his tale,

Chaucer determines the time by observing the position of the sun and by

making calculations from the length of his own shadow:

“By that the maunciple hadde his tale al ended,

The sonne fro the south lyne was descended

So lowe, that he nas nat, to my sighte,

Degrees nyne and twenty as in highte.

Foure of the clokke it was tho, as I gesse;

For eleven foot, or litel more or lesse,

My shadwe was at thilke tyme, as there,

Of swich feet as my lengthe parted were

In six feet equal of porporcioun.”[67]

We must not omit mention of the humorous touch with which Chaucer, in the

mock heroic tale of Chanticleer and the Fox told by the nun’s priest,

makes even the rooster determine the time of day by observing the altitude

of the sun in the sky:

“Chauntecleer, in al his pryde,

His seven wyves walkyng by his syde,

Caste up his eyen to the brighte sonne,

That in the signe of Taurus hadde y-ronne

Twenty degrees and oon, and somewhat more;

And knew by kynde, and by noon other lore,

That it was pryme, and crew with blisful stevene.

‘The sonne,’ he sayde, ‘is clomben up on hevene

Fourty degrees and oon, and more, y-wis.’”[68]

[Pg 33]Moreover, this remarkable rooster observed that the sun had passed the

twenty-first degree in Taurus, and we are told elsewhere that he knew each

ascension of the equinoctial and crew at each; that is, he crew every

hour, as 15° of the equinoctial correspond to an hour:

“Wel sikerer was his crowing in his logge,

Than is a clokke, or an abbey orlogge.

By nature knew he ech ascencioun[69]

Of th’ equinoxial in thilke toun;

For whan degrees fiftene were ascended,

Thanne crew he, that it mighte nat ben amended.”[70]

Chaucer announces the approach of evening by describing the position and

appearance of the sun more often than any other time of the day. In the

Legend of Good Women he speaks of the sun’s leaving the south point[71]

of his daily course and approaching the west:

“Whan that the sonne out of the south gan weste,”[72]

and again of his westward motion in the lines:

“And whan that hit is eve, I rene blyve,

As sone as ever the sonne ginneth weste,”[73]

Elsewhere Chaucer refers to the setting of the sun by saying that he has

completed his “ark divine” and may no longer remain on the horizon,[74] or

by saying that the ‘horizon has bereft the sun of his light.’[75]

Chaucer’s references to the daily motion of the sun about the earth are

apt to sound to us like purely poetical figures, so accustomed are we to

refer to the sun, what we know to be the earth’s rotatory motion, by

speaking of his apparent daily motion thus figuratively as if it were

real. Chaucer’s manner of describing the revolution of the heavenly bodies

about the earth and his application of poetic epithets to them are

figurative, but the motion itself was[Pg 34] meant literally and was believed in

by the men of his century, because only the geocentric system of astronomy

was then known. If Chaucer had been in advance of his century in this

respect there would certainly be some hint of the fact in his writings.

References in Chaucer to the sun’s yearly motion are in the same sense

literal. The apparent motion of the sun along the ecliptic,[76] which we

know to be caused by the earth’s yearly motion in an elliptical orbit

around the sun, was then believed to be an actual movement of the sun

carried along by his revolving sphere. Like the references to the sun’s

daily movements those that mention his yearly motion along the ecliptic

are also usually time references. The season of the year is indicated by

defining the sun’s position among the signs of the zodiac. The Canterbury

pilgrims set out on their journey in April when

“the yonge sonne

Hath in the Ram his halfe course y-ronne.”[77]
