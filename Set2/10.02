Chaucer’s Scientific Knowledge

It was in the fourteenth century that Chaucer lived and wrote, and his

interest in astronomical lore is, therefore, not surprising. Although the

theories of astronomy current in Chaucer’s century have been made

untenable by the De Revolutionibus Orbium of Copernicus, and by Kepler’s

discovery of the laws of planetary motion; although the inaccurate and

unsatisfactory methods of astronomical investigation then in use have been

supplanted by the better methods made possible through Galileo’s invention

of the telescope and through the modern use of spectrum analysis; yet, of

all scientific subjects, the astronomy of that period could most nearly

lay claim to the name of science according to the present acceptation of

the term. For, as we have seen, the interest in astrology during the

Middle Ages had fostered the study of observational astronomy, and this[Pg 10]

in turn had furnished the science a basis of fact and observation far

surpassing in detail and accuracy that of any other subject.

Practically all of Chaucer’s writings contain some reference to the

movements and relative positions of the heavenly bodies, and to their

influence on human and mundane affairs, and in some of his works,

especially the treatise on The Astrolabe, a very technical and detailed

knowledge of astronomical and astrological lore is displayed. There is

every reason to suppose that, so far as it satisfied his purposes, Chaucer

had made himself familiar with the whole literature of astronomical

science. His familiarity with Ptolemaic astronomy is shown in his writings

both by specific mention[1] of the name of Ptolemy and his Syntaxis,

commonly known as the ‘Almagest,’ and by many more general astronomical

references.

Even more convincing evidence of Chaucer’s knowledge of the scientific

literature of his time is given in his Treatise on the Astrolabe.

According to Skeat, Part I and at least two-thirds of Part II are taken,

with some expansion and[Pg 11] alteration, from a work on the Astrolabe by

Messahala[2], called, in the Latin translation which Chaucer used,

“Compositio et Operatio Astrolabie.” This work may have been ultimately

derived from a Sanskrit copy, but from Chaucer’s own words in the

Prologue to the Astrolabe[3] it is clear that he made use of the Latin

work. The rest of Part II may have been derived from some general

compendium of astronomical and astrological knowledge, or from some other

of the treatises on the Astrolabe which Chaucer says were common in his

time.[4]

Other sources mentioned by Chaucer in The Astrolabe are the calendars of

John Some and Nicholas Lynne, Carmelite friars who wrote calendars

constructed for the meridian of Oxford[5]; and of the Arabian astronomer

Abdilazi Alkabucius.[6] In The Frankeleyns Tale Chaucer mentions the

Tabulae Toletanae,[7] a set of tables composed by order of[Pg 12] Alphonso X,

king of Castile, and so called because they were adapted to the city of

Toledo. Works which served Chaucer not as sources of information on

scientific subjects but as models for the treatment of astronomical lore

in literature were the De Consolatione Philosophiae of Boethius, which

Chaucer translated and often made use of in his poetry; and the works of

Dante, whose influence on Chaucer, probably considerable, has been pointed

out by several writers, notably Rambeau[8] who discusses the parallels

between The Hous of Fame and the Divina Commedia.
