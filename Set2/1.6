III. WHAT THE STARS ORDAINED

TOLD BY THE ASTROLOGER

"And now, master star-gazer, your proffered story," said the

tax-collector, bestirring the company from its meditative mood.

"As I have promised," responded the astrologer, "I shall recount an

experience that shows how the stars, if read aright, can tell us the

influences for good or for evil that weigh upon a man and inevitably

determine his destiny at the critical moments of his life. What is

written is written, and it is impossible to strive against fate."

"Nay," objected the Rajput, "that is a teaching of helplessness to which

I cannot subscribe—the pitiful excuse of the coward who folds his hands

in the hour of danger, or of the self-indulgent weakling who yields to

seductive temptation because his heart inclines to seize the pleasure of

the moment even when his conscience counsels otherwise. I hold that man

is the master of his own fate. Most assuredly have I been the master of

mine," he added with a proud smile, his fingers closing significantly on

the handle of a dagger at his belt.

"Be it so," answered the astrologer. "But as Allah knows everything that

is to happen, so must it happen."

"Which does not forbid the exercise of my own free will," argued the[Pg 36]

Rajput. "The Supreme Being, the presiding power of creation, call him

Allah if you will, understanding my heart as he understands all things,

knows beforehand what choice of action I shall make at the moment of an

emergency. But that still leaves me responsible for the deed which I

elect to do. Such is my understanding of destiny. It gives

fore-knowledge to God, but leaves free will to man."

"From all of which I do not dissent," rejoined the astrologer. "It is

only the ignorant or the base that makes kismet the excuse for

helplessness or for wrongdoing. But as the stars under which a man is

born influence that man's acts, then does the reading of the stars guide

us as to what the future has in store."

"I know little about your stars," replied the Rajput. "But let us have

the story," he added, crossing his hands on his knees in an attitude of

expectancy. The astrologer, saluting his audience generally with a bow

of acquiescence, thus began:

"By your courtesy let me first explain, as necessary to the

understanding of the tale which is to follow, that I am from Persia,

from the city of Teheran, where for many generations my ancestors were

profound students of astrology, some of them famous men because of their

skilful divinations, with reputations that reached even to Stamboul. For

thither in my early boyhood to the court of the Sultan of the Osmanlis

was my father summoned, and him I never[Pg 37] beheld again. It was from my

aged grandfather that I learned my first lessons in astrology—about the

twelve houses, the ruling star of each day, the coming and the going of

the planets, their conjunctions and oppositions, and the influences they

exercise on men's lives. I learned with avidity, and was an apt pupil,

for at fifteen I had begun the practice of my profession, casting

horoscopes and reading the nocturnal heavens with constant care,

understanding also the flight of birds and the cries of wild beasts of

the jungle.

"Yet at that time was my mind assailed with grievous doubts. I often

caught myself wondering whether the stars did really rule the fates of

men. And with this inward questioning a restless spirit grew upon me. I

longed to see more of the world—to enlarge the sphere of my

observations. Just then I chanced to hear some gossip in the bazaars

about a great expedition that was getting ready at Kabul to descend upon

Hindustan. The hunger of adventure seized me, and was not to be denied.

Despite the tears and implorings of my family, I set forth on foot for

Afghanistan, a stripling; in my hand the staff I used in my divinations,

in the bag slung at my side a single change of raiment. Money I had

none, but my ability to read the stars I knew well would earn me a

livelihood wherever I might wander.

"With my adventures during the next two years this story has no concern.

It is enough to say that, after many vicissitudes of fortune, I found

myself installed as astrologer in the court of a Moslem[Pg 38] prince,

sovereign over an extensive region in Kashmir.

"My lord was a man of noble heart and of high mental gifts. He ruled

over his people not by fear of the sword, but by absolute justice, which

he himself personally administered, every day holding audience so that

grievances, even those of the most poor, might be heard and wrongs

redressed. And his royal duties were shared by his wife, who, although

she might sit behind the screen of the women's quarters, none the less

shared in the counsels of state, and contributed words of wisdom in the

direction of affairs.

"Never in my experience have I encountered such mutual love, trust, and

devotion as subsisted between this pair. For no other woman in the world

had Mirza Shah thought or regard or desire—I call him Mirza Shah, but

that was not his real name. For reasons that will presently appear, I

refrain from disclosing the identity of places and persons connected

with my story.

"Well, it was my privilege from the outset to be on relations of close

intimacy with my master. He used to come through the palace gardens to

the shrub-embowered tower which I occupied, and from the roof of which I

nightly contemplated the heavens. For long hours he would abide with me,

learning something of the stars while enjoying the cool of the night air

after the heat and fatigues of the day. And many times of an afternoon

the sultana, veiled, would come with her lord, and together they would[Pg 39]

seek to gain from me knowledge of the heavenly bodies and of divination.

Some things I told to them, but others I withheld, which is just and

right, for skill in astrology is hereditary, descending from father to

son, and new minds are unprepared for such teachings, so that too much

knowledge conveyed to outsiders may become a source of disturbance to

themselves and perchance of danger and hurt to their fellow men. Thus,

following the rules laid down for me by my grandfather, always, even

when closely pressed with questions, did I exercise a discreet reserve.

"Gradually the friendship accorded to me by my lord and his lady waxed

stronger, and I found myself being admitted to some of their innermost

thoughts. Thus did I come to learn the passionate longing of the wife to

become a mother: for six years had she waited, but no child had blessed

her love for her husband. As for Mirza Shah, just so soon as the subject

was mentioned I could see the cloud of melancholy rest on his brow. And

when, as time went on, sadness seemed to settle upon him continuously, I

knew full well that this disappointment in his wedded life had at last

taken complete possession of his mind, to the exclusion of all other

matters.

"And from the sultana's manner I could see the trepidation that filled

her heart—the dread that her childlessness might in the end rob her of

her husband's love. It was not given to me to look upon her face—to get

more than a glimpse of her eyes as they shot an occasional glance at me

through the parted folds[Pg 40] of her veil. But in these glances I had read

the prayers of entreaty that I should use all the spells of my art in

her favour, so as to obtain for her from God the gift of a son.

"Well, after a time an unexpected thing happened. Mirza Shah was absent

from his home—gone on a full week's journey, engaged in the settling of

some dispute on the confines of his territory. To me there came one

afternoon the sultana, attended by one of her women—the most trusted

one, I knew, for both were from the same country, near to Amritsar,

where the famous rugs are woven. So much I had learned, and this further

I also knew, that by birth the sultana was a Hindu, although on being

wed to her lord as a little girl, she had of course embraced the true

faith of Islam, in so far as it matters for a woman to have any religion

at all.

"It was the female attendant who spoke to me, her mistress listening in

silence. But the questions came so readily that it was clear the lesson

had been well rehearsed by the twain.

"'Astrologer,' she began, 'can you swear on the Koran that the stars

speak truth?'

"'That I can swear,' I replied, with due dignity and respect for myself

and my profession.

"'Can the stars bring about the wishes of man or of woman?'

"'Nay, that I do not declare. They rule the lives of men and women only

in so far as their movements forecast the future. If we can read the

stars aright, we may gain foreknowledge of events destined to[Pg 41] happen.

For what is written in the scroll of fate cannot be changed. From kismet

there is no escape."

"'Then tell me this, O astrologer, from your stars: is my noble lady

here ever going to have a child, a son?'

"'That question I cannot answer. Unless I have the horoscope of her

highness, cast by skilled hands at the time of her birth, I cannot tell

which planet rules her destiny.'

"'Alas, we knew not these things among my people down in Amritsar,' I

heard my lady murmur.

"'Bah!' exclaimed the serving woman contemptuously. She had flung open

her veil, unashamed as are women of her station that I, not her brother

or her husband, should gaze upon her face. It was a pleasant enough face

of a woman of five-and-twenty years of age; yet, methought, as I looked

into it now, that there was unseemly boldness in her eye and even

something of wanton abandonment in her manner.

"'Bah! If your stars cannot get us what we wish, what good are they?

Better pray at a Hindu shrine to Krishna, god of love revels, than waste

time in consulting a Moslem astrologer. That is what I have said all

along, dear lady'; and with undoubtedly great affection the woman folded

to her breast her now sobbing mistress.

"I turned away, as was proper, and busied myself with a chart of the

heavens over which I had been poring when my visitors had arrived. On

again raising my eyes, I found that I was alone.

"This incident I had well nigh forgotten, and near a year had elapsed.

For some months I had not seen[Pg 42] the sultana; she remained in the strict

seclusion of the harem. Her highness was unwell, most people said. But I

knew the truth; Mirza Shah himself had told it to me, his face beaming

with pride and pleasure. At last his dearest hopes were to be realized;

the sultana was about to become a mother.
