chapter iv. 

OF the natur OF the seven planet and OF their 

essenti and accident digniti 

Of the seven planet jupit and venus, becaus of the heat and 

moistur predomin in them, are consid by the ancient as 

benef or causer of good. the moon is so consid for the same 

reasons, though in a less degree. 

saturn and mar are causer of evil or malefic; the first from hi 

excess of cold, and the other from hi excess of heat. the sun and 

mercuri are deem of common influence—that is, either of good or 

evil, accord to the planet with which they are connected. 

the planet have particular familiar with certain place in the 

zodiac by mean of part design as their houses, and also by their 

triplicities, exalt and terms. 

the natur of their familiar by hous is as follows:— 

cancer and leo are the most northerli of all the twelv signs; they 

approach nearer than the other sign to the zenith of thi part of the 

earth, and therebi caus warmth and heat; they are consequ 

appropri as hous for the two princip and greater luminaries; 

leo for the sun, as be masculine; and cancer for the moon, as be 

feminine. 

saturn, sinc he is cold and inim to heat, move also in a 

superior orbit most remot from the luminaries, occupi the sign 

opposit to cancer and leo; these are aquariu and capricorn, and they 

are assign to him in consider of their cold and wintri nature. 

jupit ha a favour temperament, and is situat beneath the 

sphere of saturn; he, therefore, occupi the next two signs, 

sagittariu and pisces. 

mar is dri in natur and beneath the sphere of jupiter; he take the 

next two signs, of a natur similar to hi own, viz., ari and 

scorpio, whose rel distanc from the hous of the luminari are 

injuri and discordant. 

venus, possess a favour temperament, and, place beneath the 

sphere of mars, take the next two signs, tauru and libra. these are 

of a fruit natur and preserv harmoni by the sextil distance; thi 

planet is never more than two sign distant from the sun. 

mercuri never ha greater distanc from the sun than the space of one 

sign, and is beneath all the other planets; henc he is nearest to both 

luminaries, and the remain two signs, gemini and virgo, are allot 

to him. 

the "houses" of the planet are readili shown by the follow table. 

It is exactli the same as that found in the mummy-cas of the archon of 

thebes, in ancient egypt, as may be seen at the british museum: 























It will be seen, at once, from thi tabl that the sun and moon have 

each onli one hous assign them. all planet are most power in 

that sign which constitut one of their houses. planet receiv 

detriment in the sign opposit to those of their houses. thus, saturn 

would receiv detriment in cancer and leo, which are the sign opposit 

to hi houses, capricornu and aquarius. there are some sign in which 

the planet are found to be veri powerful, though not to the same 

extent as when in their own houses; these are call the "exaltations" 

of the planets, and the sign opposit to these are those in which they 

receiv their "fall" when they are consid to be weak in power. 

saturn ha hi exalt in libra; hi "fall" would therefor be in 

aries. He govern the airi triplicity, which is compos of the sign 

gemini, libra and aquariu by day, and in all the twelv sign he ha 

these degre (zodiac signs) allot him by ptolemi for hi terms:
