but it is clear that similar descript were transmit by a second 
translat from the greek which wa util in the now lost astrolog 
poem of satya (second or third century); satya' vers are reflect in 
the vrddhayavanajâtaka11 of mînarâja (fourth century), and in the 
laghujätaka12 and brhajjâtaka13 of varähamihira (sixth century). but 
varähamihira ha also use the yavanajâtaka, as ha pseudo-prthuyasas, 
who claim to be varähamihira' son, in the horâsâra.1* pseudo 
paräsara (seventh or eighth century) ha copi from the brhajjâtaka in 
the pürvakhanda of hi brhatpäräsarahoräsästra,15 while kalyänavarman 
(c. a.d. 800) ha use both the yavanajâtaka and the brhajjâtaka in the 
relev vers of the särävali,16 An anonym author cite by sivaräja 
(fifteenth century) in hi jyotirnibandha17 and mantresvara (sixteenth 
century) in the phaladîpikâ18 reli on kalyänavarman, while gunäkara 
(fourteenth century?) in hi horâmakaranda19 depend on both the 
brhajjâtaka and the sârâvalï. less import character of the 
planet can be found in the täjika20 of nilakantha (who finish the 
varsatantra in 1587) and the jâtakâbharana21 of dhundhiräja (who wrote 
in 1628). 
the most obviou dissimilar between sphujidhvaja s vers and 
those of the later indian astrolog lie in the order of the planets. 
By the fourth centuri in india it had becom an unbreak rule that 
the planet must be name in the order of their lordship of the week 
days: sun, moon, mars, mercury, jupiter, venus, and saturn. sphujidh

both of these, however, contain addit to dorotheus' text, some of 
which are parallel in the yavanajätaka. some of these addit are 
also found attribut to pythagora in some greek manuscripts,34 and 
in other they are incorpor in a longer treatis which pretend to be 
deriv from an egyptian source.35 thi "pythagorean" or "egyptian" 
text wa combin with hephaestio' quotat from dorotheu by 
rhetoriu of egypt (earli sixth century).36 outsid of both these tradi 
tions, but to some extent similar to the "pythagorean", are two short 
documents, one ascrib to an unknown anatolius,37 the other tent 
(and undoubtedli wrongly) to heliodorus.38 
finally, one must mention the planetari iconographi in the templ of 
the "säbians" of harrän known from sever descript in arab 
sources,39 as it wa thought by saxl to preserv an ancient babylonian 
tradition.40 with thi can also be compar the descript of the 
planetari imag of the "sipasians" in the dabistàn of moshan fäni.41

imag of some divin bei ngs,42 none 
and the littl that is known of the i 
who were associ with the planet 
describ as have been in harrä 
hellenist character of the nativ born under the influenc of 
the planet are in part borrow from babylonian astrology, but we are 
not yet in a posit to determin the extent of thi influence. sure 
mani particular of the imag supposedli erect by the "säbians" and 
"sipasians" and those describ elsewher in islam sourc are deriv 
from the indian tradit investig in thi paper. 
In the follow page I give the more import sanskrit text and 
translat thereof. the word underlin with a solid line in the 
vrddhayavanajdtaka, brhajjdtaka, laghujätaka, and särävali correspond 
to word in the yavanajdtaka; those italic repres idea similar to 
those in the yavanajdtaka. In an appendix I list the parallel to the adjec 
tive of sphujidhvaja and satya which I have found in the hellenist 
character of the nativ born under the influenc of each planet. 
the planetari melothesia and dosa which appear in these text will be 
discuss in detail in my edit of the yavanajdtaka.
