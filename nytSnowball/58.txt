donald trump famous said that he could shoot somebodi in the middl of fifth avenu and not "lose ani voters." i don't know about that. but i'm confid that he wouldn't lose bill barr. 

execut privilege, barr would probabl call it. he'd releas a statement or hold a news confer to say that trump had a spastic trigger finger or was trigger by adam schiff or was set up by those dastard ukrainians, who are never up to ani good. such is the magnitud of barr servility, the dogged of his deference. he the presid moral launderer. trump doe evil, and barr wash him clean. 

as attorney general, he suppos to be the nation lawyer. but he has bought into the autocrat delus that trump equal america, that nation interest and presidenti prerog are inextric intertwined. so he trump advocate, come hell or high crimes, as sure as pat cipollon or rudi giuliani is. 

on monday, show fresh contempt for the peopl who work under him in the justic department, barr renounc a determin by the depart inspector general that the f.b.i. investig into the trump campaign tie to russia was legitim and that anti-trump bias was not it anim force. he did this instantly. 

and then, on tuesday, did it again, with even less subtleti and more sanctimony. "it was a travesty," he said of the investigation, and he was speak not just of the sloppi and hast of some of the f.b.i. actions, with which the inspector general also took issue. he was dismiss the whole effort as rotten. 

it was an eeri echo of his effort last spring, when he sought to neuter robert mueller find about the trump campaign open to russian help and the presid attempt to obstruct justice. give barr point for consistency. he has bought fulli into the idea that the zeal of trump detractor matter more than the presid abus of power. 

but what of the constitution? what of common decency? barr isn't concern himself with those. to do so would call into question the honor of serv in this administration, the compliment of hold the job that trump gave him. and he want that compliment. that pedestal. he prefer to see himself as a holi warrior than as an unholi dupe. 

to appreci his perspective, you must travel back two months, to the univers of notr dame, where he deliv a speech that garner some headlin but not near enough of them. 

you should read it. you should savor it grandios — it has refer to the dawn of homo sapiens, the twilight of the judeo-christian order, edmund burke, jame madison — so that you can understand his current overreach, born of his certainti that he know better than the rest of the bodi polit and is call to heal us. 

you should note his remark obsess with moral and you should tri not to laugh, the same way you stifl chuckl when you'r remind that mike pompeo is a putat worship christian and you tri to squar that with how he abet the persecut of mari yovanovitch, leav his state depart charg twist in the wind and genuflect befor a fals prophet. in trump he trusts. 

you should dwell on the part of barr jeremiad where he say that "men are subject to power passion and appetit and, if unrestrained, are capabl of ruthless ride roughshod over their neighbor and the community." ruthless? roughshod? that trump in an allit nutshell, but barr seem to be pervers oblivi to that. he was make a case for trump presidency. 

the wonder of this wretch moment has never been the exist and stench of a bad egg in the oval office. that hard strange, given how abli shameless serv ambition. the wonder is how mani other bad egg the current presid has assembl or hatched. the wonder is this fluffy, funki omelet of unscrupulousness. 

all these suppos god men — barr, pompeo, mike pence, ben carson, rick perri and more — cluster around such a demonstr godless one. they ration that trump indulg of certain religi faction absolv him of his sins. barr is the princip agent of that absolution. 

he also a paragon of hypocrisy, tell pete william of nbc news that the f.b.i. investig of trump campaign was an omin abus of govern power for partisan aims. that descript better suit the conduct for which trump is about to be impeached. i don't know how barr kept a straight face. 

actually, i do. sinc betroth himself to trump, he has had ampl practice. in the notr dame speech, without ani palpabl sens of irony, he urg a "moral renaissance" and deliv this priceless line: "no societi can exist without some mean for restrain individu rapacity." i agree. 

in our society, impeach is one of those means. the law is another. and if barr could dig out his conscienc from under all those layer of ego, he'd see that the rapaci individu in direst need of restraint is the one he let roam free.
