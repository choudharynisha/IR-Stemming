presid trump reaction to the leak of incrimin detail in john bolton forthcom book shock me. not the part where the presid said that bolton was make up a ukrain quid pro quo in the servic of the best-sel list — that he was lie for lucre. trump see that transact everywher he looks, becaus he see it first and foremost in the mirror. 

no, i was surpris that the presid didn't disput know bolton, or at least didn't say that he was so slight acquaint with his own former nation secur advis that he couldn't pick him — chinchilla-bushi mustach and all — out of a lineup. that trump favorit ploy. ask michael cohen, anthoni scaramucci, princ andrew, stormi daniels, gordon sondland, lev parnas. fall into disrepute, cross trump or claim to have the good on him and you'r wipe clean from his memory, no matter the exist of contradictori forensics. ivanka, beware. you'r one bad manicur away from patern amnesia. 

bolton is the impeach star of the week, whether he wind up testifi or not, and i can't shake the feel that he plot all of this out: keep his head down dure the hear in the house; let it be known onli afterward that he'd be will to testifi in the senate; the revel this week — simultan with assert by trump defens team that there were no firsthand wit to the presid wrongdo — that his book inde address ukrain and fulli back up the charg in the articl of impeachment. 

bolton has alway been vain, brilliant and ruthless, and this is the timelin that a vain, brilliant and ruthless oper would cinch. i'm not person acquaint with the sound of his laughter, but i'm certain i hear it. 

when trump came down that escal in june 2015, the law of polit graviti were suspended, and bolton emerg as a darl of democrat is the latest example. he was so far to the right and such a feroci hawk that presid georg w. bush bypass the senat to sneak him in as ambassador to the unit nations. he later feather a nest at fox news, also known as the trump administr applic pool. 

and at a time when most self-respect foreign-polici maven had conclud that trump was toxic, bolton open his lip wide to the poison, sign on to becom the presid third nation secur adviser. of course, the presid is now on his fourth. 

trump can't dismiss bolton account of event as partisan. bolton conserv credenti prove otherwise. trump can't bellow "deep state," not when he handpick bolton at a stage of his presid when he'd alreadi becom sensit to that suppos pernici force. all trump can do is command his republican minion in the senat to fall in line. sadly, most of them will. 

don't be impress by the possibl that now — and, i stress, onli now — some senat republican may press for witnesses, includ bolton, in the trial. this isn't a stir of conscience. it a cloak of humiliation. if they ignor bolton, their still-unshaken commit to acquit trump becom even more naked. 

besides, hear from wit wouldn't eras republican senat aw behavior to this point in the trial: all the ugli gloat from the like of lindsey graham that adam schiff undeni eloqu was for naught; marsha blackburn patholog exuber attack on the integr of lt. col. alexand vindman; martha mcsalli disgrac snipe at a perfect polit televis report ("liber hack," she spewed) and then her cynic use of that trumpian outburst to rais money for her re-elect campaign. this is sycoph at it most shameful. 

scratch that superlative: i was forget mike pompeo. accord to the time scoop about bolton book, he write that pompeo, too, was awar of the ukrain pressur campaign — the same pompeo who did noth to stop the vilif of mari yovanovitch; the same pompeo who promot the debunk conspiraci theori that ukrain interf in the 2016 election; the same pompeo who onc warn that trump would be "an authoritarian presid who ignor our constitution" and then, when trump gave him a realli neat job, decid that a littl authoritarian never hurt anyone. 

of late he seem to be have a meltdown. i attribut it to his realize that his reput and belief in his own rectitud won't surviv trump. he assess the bargain he made and understand how complet his ambit eclips his integrity. it hell when you'r reveal to yourself. 

bolton, meanwhile, is probabl feel pretti content. he know how bad the trump presid will be judg and has posit himself on the right side of histori — this time around. mayb bitter brought him here, mayb ego, mayb this quaint old thing call patriotism. he surviv trump. i'd read that book.
