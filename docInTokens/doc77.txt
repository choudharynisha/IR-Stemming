the
man
tried
his
best
to
sell
me
the
house
he
was
confident
that
i
would
like
it
repeatedly
he
called
my
attention
to
the
view
there
was
something
in
what
he
said
about
the
view
the
villa
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
commanded
a
vision
of
the
valley
vine-clad
and
cottage-studded
it
was
an
irregular
bowl
of
green
dotted
with
stone
houses
which
were
whitewashed
to
almost
painful
brilliancy
the
valley
was
three
and
a
third
miles
at
its
greatest
width
standing
at
the
front
door
of
the
house
an
expert
marksman
with
telescopic
sight
could
have
placed
a
rifle
bullet
in
each
of
the
white
marks
of
cottages
they
nestled
like
little
pearls
amid
a
sea
of
green
grape-vines
a
wonderful
view
signor
the
real-estate
agent
repeated
that
scene
at
any
time
of
the
year
is
worth
twice
what
i
am
asking
for
the
villa
but
i
can
see
all
this
without
buying
i
argued
not
without
trespassing
but
the
place
is
old
it
has
no
running
water
wrong
and
he
smiled
expansively
showing
a
row
of
gold-filled
teeth
listen
we
were
silent
there
came
to
us
the
sound
of
bubbling
water
turning
i
traced
the
sound
i
found
a
marble
cupid
spurting
water
in
a
most
peculiar
way
into
a
wall
basin
i
smiled
and
commented
there
is
one
like
that
in
brussels
and
another
in
madrid
but
this
is
very
fine
however
i
referred
to
running
water
in
a
modern
bathroom
but
why
bathe
when
you
can
sit
here
and
enjoy
the
view
he
was
impossible
so
i
wrote
a
check
took
his
bill
of
sale
and
became
the
owner
of
a
mountain
topped
by
a
stone
house
that
seemed
to
be
half
ruin
but
he
did
not
know
and
i
did
not
tell
him
that
i
considered
the
fountain
alone
worth
the
price
that
i
had
paid
in
fact
i
had
come
to
italy
to
buy
that
fountain
if
i
could
buy
it
and
take
it
back
to
america
with
me
i
knew
all
about
that
curious
piece
of
marble
george
seabrook
had
written
to
me
about
it
just
one
letter
and
then
he
had
gone
on
goodness
knows
where
george
was
like
that
always
on
the
move
now
i
owned
the
fountain
and
was
already
planning
where
i
should
place
it
in
my
new
york
home
certainly
not
in
the
rose
garden
i
sat
down
on
a
marble
bench
and
looked
down
on
the
valley
the
real-estate
man
was
right
it
was
a
delicate
delicious
piece
of
scenery
the
surrounding
mountains
were
high
enough
to
throw
a
constant
shadow
on
some
part
of
the
valley
except
at
high
noon
there
was
no
sign
of
life
but
i
was
sure
that
the
vineyards
were
alive
with
husband-men
and
their
families
an
eagle
floated
serenely
on
the
upper
air
currents
automatically
adjusting
himself
to
their
constant
changing
stretching
myself
i
gave
one
look
at
my
car
and
then
walked
into
the
house





in
the
kitchen
two
peasants
sat
an
old
man
and
an
old
woman
they
rose
as
i
entered
who
are
you
i
asked
in
english
they
simply
smiled
and
waved
their
hands
i
repeated
my
question
in
italian
we
serve
the
man
replied
serve
whom
whoever
is
the
master
have
you
been
here
long
we
have
always
been
here
it
is
our
home
his
statement
amused
me
and
i
commented
the
masters
come
and
go
but
you
remain
it
seems
so
many
masters
alas
yes
they
come
and
go
nice
young
men
like
you
but
they
do
not
stay
they
buy
and
look
at
the
view
and
eat
with
us
a
few
days
and
then
they
are
gone
and
then
the
villa
is
sold
again
the
man
shrugged
how
should
we
know
we
simply
serve
then
prepare
me
my
dinner
and
serve
it
outside
under
the
grapevine
where
i
can
see
the
view
the
woman
started
to
obey
the
man
came
nearer
shall
i
carry
your
bags
to
the
bedroom
yes
and
i
will
go
with
you
and
unpack
he
took
me
to
a
room
on
the
second
floor
there
was
a
bed
there
and
a
very
old
chest
of
drawers
the
floor
everything
about
the
room
was
spotlessly
clean
the
walls
had
been
freshly
whitewashed
their
smooth
whiteness
suggested
wonderful
possibilities
for
despoliation
the
drawing
of
a
picture
the
writing
of
a
poem
the
careless
writhing
autograph
that
caused
my
relatives
so
much
despair
have
all
the
masters
slept
here
i
asked
carelessly
all
was
there
one
by
the
name
of
george
seabrook
i
think
so
but
they
come
and
go
i
am
old
and
forget
and
all
these
masters
none
of
them
ever
wrote
on
the
walls
of
a
certainty
all
wrote
with
pencil
what
they
desired
to
write
who
should
say
they
should
not
for
did
not
the
villa
belong
to
them
while
they
were
here
but
always
we
prepared
for
the
new
master
and
made
the
walls
clean
and
beautiful
again
you
were
always
sure
that
there
would
be
a
new
master
certainly
someone
must
pay
us
our
wages
i
gravely
placed
a
gold
piece
in
his
itching
palm
asking
what
did
they
write
on
the
walls
he
looked
at
me
with
old
unblinking
eyes
owl
eyes
that
is
what
they
were
and
he
slowly
said
each
wrote
or
drew
as
his
fancy
led
him
for
they
were
the
masters
and
could
do
as
they
wished
but
what
were
the
words
i
cannot
speak
english
or
read
it
evidently
the
man
was
not
going
to
talk
to
me
the
entire
situation
was
most
interesting
same
servants
same
villa
many
masters
they
came
and
bought
and
wrote
on
the
wall
and
left
and
then
my
real-estate
friend
sold
the
house
again
a
fine
racket
downstairs
outdoors
under
the
grapevine
eating
a
good
italian
meal
looking
at
the
wonderful
view
i
came
to
laugh
at
my
suspicions
i
ate
spaghetti
olives
dark
bread
and
wine
silence
hung
heavily
over
the
sullen
sleepy
afternoon
the
sky
became
copper-colored
it
was
about
to
rain
the
old
man
came
and
showed
me
a
place
to
put
my
car
a
recess
in
the
wall
of
the
house
open
at
one
end
but
sheltered
from
the
weather
the
stone
floor
was
black
with
grease
more
than
one
automobile
had
been
kept
there
other
cars
have
been
here
i
ventured
all
the
masters
had
cars
the
old
man
replied





back
on
the
stone
gallery
i
waited
for
the
storm
to
break
at
last
it
came
in
a
solid
wall
of
gray
wetness
across
the
valley
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
till
it
deluged
my
villa
and
drove
me
inside
the
woman
was
lighting
candles
i
took
one
from
her
hand
i
want
to
look
through
the
house
i
explained
she
made
no
protest
so
i
started
exploring
the
first
floor
one
room
was
evidently
the
sleeping-quarters
for
the
servants
another
was
the
kitchen
and
the
remaining
two
might
have
served
in
the
old
days
for
dining-room
and
drawing-room
there
was
little
furniture
and
the
walls
were
gray
with
time
and
mold
one
flight
of
stone
stairs
led
upward
to
the
bedroom
another
to
the
cellar
i
decided
to
go
downstairs
they
were
steps
not
made
of
masonry
but
apparently
carved
out
of
the
living
rock
the
cellar
was
simply
a
cubical
hole
in
the
mountain
it
all
looked
very
old
i
had
the
uneasy
feeling
that
originally
that
cellar
had
been
a
tomb
and
that
later
the
house
had
been
built
over
it
but
once
at
the
bottom
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
a
sepulcher
a
few
small
casks
of
wine
some
junk
odds
of
rope
and
rusty
iron
those
were
in
the
corners
otherwise
the
room
was
empty
and
dusty
it
is
an
odd
room
i
commented
to
myself
it
seemed
in
some
way
out
of
place
and
out
of
shape
and
size
for
the
villa
above
it
i
had
expected
something
more
something
larger
gloomier
walking
around
i
examined
the
walls
and
then
something
came
to
my
alert
senses
three
sides
of
the
room
were
carved
out
of
rock
but
the
remaining
side
was
of
masonry
and
in
that
side
there
was
a
door
a
door
and
why
should
a
door
be
there
except
to
lead
to
another
room
there
was
a
door
and
that
presupposed
something
on
the
other
side
and
what
a
door
it
was
more
of
a
barricade
than
a
partition
the
iron
hinges
were
built
to
support
weight
and
give
complete
defense
and
support
there
was
a
keyhole
and
if
the
key
corresponded
with
the
size
of
the
hole
it
was
the
largest
that
i
had
ever
heard
of
naturally
i
wanted
to
open
the
door
as
master
of
the
villa
i
had
a
right
to
upstairs
the
old
woman
seemed
unable
to
understand
me
and
ended
by
telling
me
to
see
her
husband
he
in
turn
seemed
incapable
of
following
my
stream
of
talk
at
last
i
took
him
to
the
door
and
pointed
to
the
keyhole
in
english
italian
and
sign
language
i
told
him
rather
emphatically
that
i
wanted
the
key
to
that
door
at
last
he
was
willing
to
admit
that
he
understood
my
questions
he
shook
his
head
he
had
never
had
the
key
to
that
door
yes
he
knew
that
there
was
such
a
door
but
he
had
never
been
on
the
other
side
it
was
very
old
perhaps
his
ancestors
understood
about
it
but
they
were
all
dead
he
made
me
tired
so
much
so
that
i
rested
by
placing
a
hand
on
the
butt
of
the
upper
hinge
i
knew
that
he
was
deceiving
me
lived
there
all
his
life
and
never
saw
the
door
open
and
you
have
no
key
to
that
door
i
repeated
no
i
have
no
key
who
has
the
key
the
owner
of
the
house
but
i
own
it
yes
you
are
the
master
but
i
mean
the
one
who
owns
it
all
the
time
so
the
various
masters
do
not
really
buy
the
place
they
buy
it
but
they
come
and
go
but
the
owner
keeps
on
selling
it
and
owning
it
yes
must
be
a
profitable
business
and
who
owns
it
donna
marchesi
i
think
i
met
her
yesterday
in
sorona
yes
that
is
where
she
lives
the
storm
had
passed
sorona
was
only
two
miles
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
the
cellar
the
door
the
mysterious
uncertainty
on
the
other
side
intrigued
me
i
told
the
man
that
i
would
be
back
by
supper
and
i
went
to
my
bedroom
to
change
preparatory
to
making
an
afternoon
call
in
the
room
i
found
my
hand
black
with
oil
and
that
told
me
a
good
many
things
as
it
was
the
hand
that
had
rested
against
the
upper
hinge
of
the
door
i
washed
the
hand
changed
my
clothes
and
drove
my
car
to
sorona





fortunately
the
donna
marchesi
was
at
home
i
might
have
met
her
before
but
i
now
saw
her
ethereal
beauty
for
the
first
time
at
least
it
seemed
ethereal
at
the
first
moment
in
some
ways
she
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
that
i
had
ever
seen
skin
white
as
milk
hair
a
tawny
red
piled
in
great
masses
on
her
head
and
eyes
of
a
peculiar
green
with
pupils
that
were
slots
instead
of
circles
she
wore
her
nails
long
and
they
were
tinted
red
to
match
the
titian
of
her
hair
she
seemed
surprized
to
have
me
call
on
her
and
more
surprized
to
hear
of
my
errand
you
bought
the
villa
she
asked
yes
though
when
i
bought
it
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
the
owner
the
agent
never
stated
whom
he
was
acting
for
i
know
she
said
with
a
smile
franco
is
peculiar
that
way
he
always
pretends
that
he
owns
the
place
no
doubt
he
has
used
it
more
than
once
i
fear
so
the
place
seems
to
be
unfortunate
i
sell
it
with
a
reserve
clause
the
owner
must
live
there
and
no
one
seems
to
want
to
stay
so
the
place
reverts
back
to
me
it
seems
to
be
an
old
place
very
old
it
has
been
in
my
family
for
generations
i
have
tried
to
get
rid
of
it
but
what
can
i
do
when
the
young
men
will
not
stay
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
expressively
i
countered
with
perhaps
if
they
knew
as
i
do
that
you
owned
the
property
they
would
be
content
to
stay
for
ever
in
sorona
prettily
said
she
answered
then
the
room
became
silent
and
i
heard
her
heavy
breathing
like
the
deep
purr
of
a
cat
they
come
and
go
she
said
at
last
and
when
they
go
you
sell
to
another
i
asked
naturally
and
with
the
hope
that
one
will
stay
i
have
come
for
the
key
i
said
bluntly
the
key
to
the
cellar
door
are
you
sure
you
want
it
absolutely
it
is
my
villa
and
my
cellar
and
my
door
i
want
the
key
i
want
to
see
what
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
and
then
it
was
that
i
saw
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
narrow
to
livid
slits
she
looked
at
me
for
a
second
for
five
and
then
opening
a
drawer
in
a
cabinet
near
her
chair
she
took
out
the
key
and
handed
it
to
me
it
was
a
tool
worthy
of
the
door
that
it
was
supposed
to
open
being
fully
eight
inches
long
and
a
pound
in
weight
taking
it
i
thanked
her
and
said
good-bye
fifteen
minutes
later
i
was
back
profuse
in
my
apologies
i
was
temperamental
i
explained
and
i
frequently
changed
my
mind
whatever
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
could
stay
there
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
then
again
i
kissed
her
hand
farewell
on
the
side
street
i
passed
through
the
door
of
a
locksmith
and
waited
while
he
completed
a
key
he
was
following
a
wax
impression
of
the
original
key
an
hour
later
i
was
on
the
way
back
to
the
villa
with
the
key
in
my
pocket
a
key
that
i
was
sure
would
unlock
the
door
and
i
was
confident
that
the
lady
with
the
cat
eyes
felt
sure
that
i
had
lost
all
interest
in
that
door
and
what
was
beyond
it
the
full
moon
was
just
appearing
over
the
mountains
when
i
drove
my
car
up
to
the
villa
i
was
tired
but
happy
taking
the
candlestick
in
my
hand
which
candlestick
was
handed
to
me
with
a
deep
bow
by
the
old
woman
i
ascended
the
stairs
to
my
bedroom
and
soon
i
was
fast
asleep





i
awoke
with
a
start
the
moon
was
still
shining
it
was
midnight
i
heard
or
thought
i
heard
a
deep
moaning
it
sounded
a
little
like
waves
beating
on
a
rockbound
coast
then
it
ceased
and
was
replaced
by
a
musical
element
that
came
in
certain
stately
measures
those
sounds
were
in
the
room
but
they
came
from
far
away
only
by
straining
my
sense
of
sound
to
the
utmost
could
i
hear
anything
slippers
on
my
feet
flashlight
in
my
hand
and
the
key
in
the
pocket
of
my
dressing-gown
i
slowly
descended
the
stairs
loud
snores
from
the
servants'
room
told
or
seemed
to
tell
of
their
deep
slumbers
down
into
the
cellar
i
went
and
put
the
key
into
the
hole
of
the
lock
the
key
turned
easily--no
rust
there--the
springs
and
the
tumblers
had
been
well
oiled
like
the
hinges
it
was
evident
that
the
door
had
been
used
often
turning
the
light
on
the
hinges
i
saw
what
had
made
my
hand
black
with
oil
earnestly
i
damned
the
servants
they
knew
about
the
door
they
knew
what
was
on
the
other
side
just
as
i
was
about
to
open
the
door
i
heard
a
woman's
voice
singing
in
italian
it
sounded
like
a
selection
from
an
opera
it
was
followed
by
applause
and
then
a
moaning
and
one
shrill
cry
as
though
someone
had
been
hurt
there
was
no
doubt
now
as
to
where
the
sounds
that
i
heard
in
my
room
had
come
from
they
had
come
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
there
was
a
mystery
there
for
me
to
solve
but
i
was
not
ready
to
solve
it
so
i
turned
the
key
noiselessly
and
with
the
door
locked
tiptoed
back
to
my
bed
there
i
tried
to
put
two
and
two
together
they
made
five
seven
a
million
vague
admixtures
of
impossible
results
all
filled
with
weird
forebodings
but
never
did
they
make
four
and
till
they
did
i
knew
the
answers
to
be
wrong
for
two
and
two
had
to
make
four
many
changes
of
masters
one
after
another
they
came
and
bought
and
disappeared
a
whitewashed
wall
what
secrets
were
covered
with
that
whitewash
a
door
in
a
cellar
and
what
deviltry
went
on
behind
it
a
key
and
a
well-oiled
lock
and
servants
that
knew
everything
in
vain
the
question
came
to
me
what
is
back
of
the
door
there
was
no
ready
answer
but
donna
marchesi
knew
was
it
her
voice
that
i
had
heard
she
knew
almost
everything
about
it
but
there
was
one
thing
that
i
knew
and
she
did
not
she
did
not
know
that
i
could
pass
through
the
door
and
find
out
what
was
on
the
other
side
she
did
not
know
that
i
had
a
key
the
next
day
i
pleaded
indisposition
and
spent
most
of
the
hours
idling
and
drowsing
in
my
chamber
not
till
nearly
midnight
did
i
venture
down
the
servants
were
certainly
asleep
that
time
a
dose
of
chloral
in
their
wine
had
attended
to
the
certainty
of
their
slumbers
fully
dressed
with
an
automatic
in
my
pocket
i
reached
the
cellar
and
opened
the
door
it
swung
noiselessly
on
its
well-greased
hinges
the
darkness
on
the
other
side
was
the
blackness
of
hell
an
indescribable
odor
came
to
me
a
prison
smell
and
with
it
the
soft
half
sob
half
laugh
of
sleeping
children
dreaming
in
their
sleep
and
not
happy
i
flashed
the
light
around
the
room
it
was
not
a
room
but
a
cavern
a
cave
that
extended
far
into
the
distance
the
roof
supported
by
stone
pillars
set
at
regular
intervals
as
far
as
my
light
would
carry
i
saw
the
long
rows
of
white
columns
and
to
each
pillar
was
bound
a
man
by
chains
they
were
resting
on
the
stone
floor
twenty
or
more
of
them
and
all
asleep
snores
grunts
and
weary
sighs
came
from
them
but
not
a
single
eyelid
opened
even
when
i
flashed
the
light
in
their
faces
their
eyes
were
shut
and
those
faces
sickened
me
white
and
drawn
and
filled
with
the
lines
of
deep
suffering
all
were
covered
with
scars
long
narrow
deep
scars
some
fresh
and
red
others
old
and
dead-white
at
last
the
sunken
eyelids
and
the
inability
to
see
my
flashlight
and
respond
told
me
the
nauseating
truth
those
men
were
all
blind
illustration
looking
eternally
into
the
blackness
of
his
life
and
chained
to
a
pillar
of
stone
a
pleasant
sight
one
blind
man
looking
eternally
into
the
blackness
of
his
life
and
chained
to
a
pillar
of
stone--that
was
bad
enough
but
multiply
that
by
twenty
was
it
worse
could
it
be
worse
could
twenty
men
suffer
more
than
one
man
and
then
a
thought
came
to
me
a
terrible
impossible
thought
so
horrible
that
i
doubted
my
logic
but
now
two
and
two
were
beginning
to
make
four
could
those
men
be
the
masters
they
came
and
bought
and
left--to
go
to
the
cellar
and
stay
there
oh
donna
marchesi
i
whispered
how
about
those
cat-eyes
if
you
had
a
hand
in
this
you
are
not
a
woman
you
are
a
tiger





i
thought
that
i
understood
part
of
it
the
latest
master
came
to
her
for
the
key
to
the
cellar
and
then
when
he
once
passed
through
the
door
he
never
left
she
and
her
servants
were
not
there
to
welcome
me
that
night
because
she
did
not
know
that
i
had
a
key
the
thought
came
to
me
that
perhaps
one
of
those
sleeping
men
was
george
seabrook
he
and
i
used
to
play
tennis
together
and
we
knew
each
other
like
brothers
he
had
a
large
scar
on
the
back
of
his
right
hand
a
livid
star-shaped
scar
with
that
in
mind
i
walked
carefully
from
sleeping
man
to
sleeping
man
looking
at
their
right
hands
and
i
found
a
right
hand
with
a
scar
that
was
shaped
like
the
one
i
knew
so
well
but
that
blind
man
only
a
skin-covered
skeleton
chained
to
a
bed
of
stone
that
could
not
be
my
gay
young
tennis
player
george
the
discovery
nauseated
me
what
did
it
mean
what
could
it
mean
if
the
donna
marchesi
was
back
of
all
that
misery
what
was
her
motive
down
the
long
cave-like
room
i
went
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
it
though
many
of
the
columns
were
surrounded
with
empty
chains
only
those
near
the
door
had
their
human
flies
in
the
trap
in
the
opposite
direction
the
rows
of
pillars
stretched
into
a
far
oblivion
i
thought
that
at
the
end
there
was
the
black
mouth
of
a
tunnel
but
i
could
not
be
sure
and
dared
not
go
that
far
to
explore
the
truth
then
out
of
that
tunnel
i
heard
a
voice
come
a
singing
voice
slipping
my
shoes
off
i
ran
back
near
the
door
and
hid
as
best
i
could
in
a
dark
recess
back
of
a
far
piece
of
stone
i
stood
there
in
the
darkness
my
torch
out
the
handle
of
the
revolver
in
my
hand
the
singing
grew
louder
and
louder
and
then
the
singer
came
into
view
it
was
none
other
than
donna
marchesi
she
carried
a
lantern
in
one
hand
and
a
basket
in
the
other
hanging
the
lantern
on
a
nail
she
took
the
basket
and
went
from
one
sleeping
man
to
another
with
each
her
performance
was
the
same
she
awakened
them
with
a
kick
in
the
face
and
then
when
they
sat
up
crying
with
pain
she
placed
a
hard
roll
of
bread
in
their
blind
trembling
outstretched
hand
with
all
fed
there
was
silence
save
for
gnawing
teeth
breaking
through
the
hard
crusts
the
poor
devils
were
hungry
starving
slowly
to
death
and
how
they
wolfed
the
bread
she
laughed
with
animal
delight
as
they
cried
for
more
standing
under
the
lamp
a
lovely
devil
in
her
decolletã©
dress
she
laughed
at
them
i
swear
i
saw
her
yellow
eyes
dilated
in
the
semi-darkness
suddenly
she
gave
the
command
up
you
dogs
up





like
well-trained
animals
they
rose
to
their
feet
clumsily
but
as
fast
as
they
could
under
the
handicap
of
trembling
limbs
and
heavy
chains
two
were
slow
in
obeying
and
those
she
struck
across
the
face
with
a
small
whip
till
they
whined
with
pain
they
stood
there
in
silence
twenty
odd
blind
men
chained
against
as
many
pillars
of
stone
and
then
the
woman
standing
in
the
middle
of
them
started
to
sing
it
was
a
well-trained
voice
but
metallic
and
her
high
notes
had
in
them
the
cry
of
a
wild
animal
no
feminine
softness
there
she
sang
from
an
italian
opera
and
i
knew
that
i
had
heard
that
song
before
while
she
sang
her
audience
waited
silently
at
last
she
finished
and
they
started
to
applaud
shrunken
hands
beat
noisily
against
shrunken
hands
she
seemed
to
watch
them
carefully
as
though
she
were
measuring
the
degree
of
their
appreciation
one
man
did
not
satisfy
her
she
went
over
and
dug
into
his
face
with
long
strokes
of
those
long
red
nails
until
his
face
was
red
and
her
fingers
bloody
and
when
she
finished
her
second
song
that
man
clapped
louder
than
any
of
them
he
had
learned
his
lesson
she
ended
by
giving
them
each
another
roll
and
a
dipper
of
water
then
lantern
and
basket
in
her
hands
she
walked
away
and
disappeared
down
the
tunnel
the
blind
men
crying
and
cursing
in
their
impotent
rage
sank
down
on
their
stone
beds
i
went
to
my
friend
and
took
his
hand
george
george
seabrook
i
whispered
he
sat
up
and
cried
who
calls
me
who
is
there
i
told
him
and
he
started
to
cry
at
last
he
became
quiet
enough
to
talk
to
me
what
he
told
me
with
slight
variants
was
the
story
of
all
the
men
there
and
all
the
men
who
had
been
there
but
who
had
died
each
man
had
been
master
for
a
day
or
a
week
each
had
found
the
cellar
door
and
had
come
to
the
donna
marchesi
for
the
key
some
had
been
suspicious
and
had
written
their
thoughts
on
the
wall
of
their
bedroom
but
one
and
all
had
in
the
end
found
their
curiosity
more
than
they
could
resist
and
had
opened
the
door
on
the
other
side
they
had
been
overpowered
and
chained
to
a
pillar
and
there
they
had
remained
till
they
died
some
of
them
lived
longer
than
the
rest
smith
of
boston
had
been
there
over
two
years
though
he
was
coughing
badly
and
did
not
think
that
he
could
last
much
longer
seabrook
told
me
their
names
they
were
the
best
blood
of
america
with
three
englishmen
and
one
frenchman
and
are
you
all
blind
i
whispered
dreading
the
answer
yes
that
happens
the
first
night
we
are
here
she
does
it
with
her
nails
and
she
comes
every
night
every
night
she
feeds
us
and
sings
to
us
and
we
applaud
when
one
of
us
dies
she
unchains
the
body
and
throws
it
down
a
hole
somewhere
she
talks
to
us
about
that
hole
sometimes
and
brags
that
she
is
going
to
fill
it
up
before
she
stops
but
who
is
helping
her
i
think
it
is
the
real-estate
man
of
course
the
old
devils
upstairs
help
i
think
that
they
must
drug
us
some
of
the
men
say
that
they
went
to
sleep
in
their
beds
and
woke
chained
to
their
posts
my
voice
trembled
as
i
bent
over
and
whispered
in
his
ear
what
would
you
do
george
if
she
came
and
sang
and
you
found
that
you
were
not
chained
you
and
the
other
men
not
chained
what
would
you
men
do
george
ask
them
he
snarled
ask
them
one
at
a
time
but
i
know
what
i
would
do
i
know
and
he
started
to
cry
because
he
could
not
do
it
the
next
second
cried
from
rage
and
helplessness
till
the
tears
ran
from
his
empty
sockets
does
she
always
come
at
the
same
time
as
far
as
i
know
but
time
is
nothing
to
us
we
just
wait
for
death
are
the
chains
locked
yes
and
she
must
have
the
key
but
we
could
file
the
links
if
only
we
had
files
if
only
each
of
us
had
a
file
we
could
get
free
perhaps
the
man
upstairs
has
a
key
but
i
hardly
think
so
did
you
write
on
that
pretty
wall
upstairs
the
whitewashed
wall
i
did
i
think
we
all
did
one
man
wrote
a
sonnet
to
the
woman
verses
in
her
honor
telling
about
her
beautiful
eyes
he
raved
about
that
poem
for
hours
while
he
was
dying
did
you
ever
see
it
on
the
wall
i
did
not
see
it
the
old
people
whitewash
the
walls
before
each
new
master
comes
i
thought
so
are
you
sure
you
would
know
what
to
do
george
if
she
sang
to
you
and
you
were
loose
yes
we
would
know
so
i
left
him
promising
an
end
to
the
matter
as
soon
as
i
could
arrange
it





the
next
day
saw
me
calling
on
the
donna
marchesi
i
took
her
flowers
that
time
a
corsage
of
vivid
purple
and
scarlet
orchids
she
entertained
me
in
her
music
room
and
i
taking
the
hint
asked
her
to
sing
shyly
almost
with
reluctance
she
did
as
i
asked
she
sang
the
selection
from
the
italian
opera
that
i
knew
so
well
i
was
generous
in
my
applause
she
smiled
you
like
to
hear
me
sing
indeed
i
want
to
hear
you
again
i
could
hear
you
daily
without
growing
tired
you're
nice
she
purred
perhaps
it
could
be
arranged
you
are
too
modest
you
have
a
wonderful
voice
why
not
give
it
to
the
world
i
sang
once
in
public
she
sighed
it
was
in
new
york
at
a
private
musical
there
were
many
men
there
perhaps
it
was
stage
fright
my
voice
broke
badly
and
the
audience
especially
the
men
were
not
kind
i
am
not
sure
but
i
thought
that
i
heard
some
of
them
hiss
me
surely
not
i
protested
indeed
so
but
no
man
has
hissed
my
singing
since
then
i
hope
not
i
replied
indignantly
you
have
a
wonderful
voice
and
when
i
applauded
you
i
was
sincere
by
the
way
may
i
change
my
mind
and
ask
for
the
key
to
the
door
in
the
cellar
do
you
want
it
really
want
it
my
friend
i
am
sure
i
do
i
may
never
use
it
but
it
will
please
me
to
have
it
little
things
in
life
make
me
happy
and
this
key
is
a
little
thing
then
you
shall
have
it
will
you
do
me
a
favor
wait
till
sunday
to
use
it
today
is
friday
and
you
will
not
have
to
wait
many
hours
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
do
as
you
desire
i
replied
kissing
her
hand
and
shall
i
hear
you
sing
again
may
i
come
often
to
hear
you
sing
i
promise
you
that
she
sighed
i
am
sure
that
you
will
hear
me
sing
often
in
the
future
i
feel
that
in
some
way
our
fates
approach
the
same
star
i
looked
into
her
eyes
her
yellow
cat-eyes
and
i
was
sure
that
she
spoke
the
truth
destiny
had
certainly
brought
me
to
find
her
in
sorona





i
bought
two
dozen
rat-tailed
files
and
dashed
across
the
mountains
to
milan
there
i
was
closeted
with
the
consuls
of
three
nations
england
france
and
my
own
they
did
not
want
to
believe
my
story
i
gave
them
names
and
they
had
to
admit
that
there
had
been
inquiries
but
they
felt
that
the
main
details
were
nightmares
resulting
from
an
over-use
of
italian
wines
but
i
insisted
that
i
was
not
drunk
with
new
wine
at
last
they
called
in
the
chief
of
the
detective
bureau
he
knew
franco
the
real-estate
agent
also
the
lady
in
question
and
he
had
heard
something
of
the
villa
not
much
but
vague
whisperings
we
will
be
there
saturday
night
he
promised
that
leaves
you
tonight
the
lady
will
not
try
to
trap
you
till
sunday
can
you
attend
to
the
old
people
they
will
be
harmless
see
that
franco
does
not
have
a
chance
to
escape
here
is
the
extra
key
to
the
door
i
will
go
through
before
twelve
when
i
am
ready
i
will
open
the
door
if
i
am
not
out
by
one
in
the
morning
you
come
through
with
your
police
do
we
all
understand
i
understand
said
the
american
consul
but
i
still
think
you
are
dreaming
back
at
the
villa
i
again
drugged
the
old
people
not
much
but
enough
to
insure
their
sleep
that
night
they
liked
me
i
was
liberal
with
my
gold
and
i
carelessly
showed
them
where
i
kept
my
reserve
then
i
went
through
the
door
again
i
heard
the
donna
marchesi
sing
to
an
audience
that
would
never
hiss
her
she
left
and
i
started
to
distribute
the
files
from
one
blind
wretch
to
the
next
i
went
whispering
words
of
cheer
and
instruction
for
the
next
night
they
were
to
cut
through
a
link
in
the
chain
but
in
such
a
way
that
the
tiger
cat
would
not
suspect
that
they
had
gained
their
liberty
were
they
pleased
to
have
a
hope
of
freedom
i
am
not
sure
but
they
were
delighted
at
another
prospect
the
next
night
i
doubled
the
tips
to
the
old
servants
with
tears
of
gratitude
in
their
eyes
they
thanked
me
as
they
called
me
their
dear
master
i
put
them
to
sleep
as
though
they
were
babies
in
fact
i
wondered
at
the
time
if
they
would
ever
recover
from
the
dose
of
chloral
i
gave
them
i
did
not
even
bother
to
tie
them
but
just
tossed
them
on
their
beds
at
half
past
ten
automobiles
began
to
arrive
with
darkened
lights
we
had
a
lengthy
conference
and
soon
after
eleven
i
went
through
the
door
i
lost
no
time
in
making
sure
that
each
of
the
blind
mice
was
a
free
man
but
i
insisted
that
they
act
as
though
bound
till
the
proper
time
they
were
trembling
but
it
was
not
from
fear
not
that
time
back
in
my
hiding-place
i
waited
and
soon
i
heard
the
singing
voice
ten
minutes
later
the
donna
marchesi
had
her
lantern
hung
on
the
nail
ah
she
was
more
beautiful
that
night
than
i
had
ever
seen
her
dressed
in
filmy
white
her
beautiful
body
lovely
hair
long
lithe
limbs
would
have
bound
any
man
to
her
through
eternity
she
seemed
to
sense
that
beauty
for
after
giving
out
the
first
supply
of
rolls
she
varied
her
program
she
told
her
audience
how
she
had
dressed
that
evening
for
their
special
pleasure
she
described
her
jewels
and
her
costume
she
almost
became
grandiose
as
she
told
of
her
beauty
and
driving
in
the
dagger
she
twisted
it
as
she
reminded
them
that
never
would
they
be
able
to
see
her
never
touch
her
or
kiss
her
hand
all
they
could
do
was
to
hear
her
sing
applaud
and
at
last
die
of
all
the
terrible
things
in
her
life
that
little
talk
to
those
blind
men
was
the
climax
and
then
she
sang
i
watched
her
closely
and
i
saw
what
i
suspected
she
sang
with
her
eyes
closed
was
she
in
fancy
seeming
that
she
was
in
an
opera-house
before
thousands
of
spellbound
admirers
who
knows
but
ever
as
she
sang
that
night
her
eyes
were
closed
and
even
as
she
came
to
a
close
waiting
for
the
usual
applause
her
eyes
were
closed





she
waited
in
the
silence
for
the
clap
of
hands
it
did
not
come
with
terrific
anger
she
whirled
to
her
basket
and
reached
for
her
whip
dogs
she
cried
have
you
so
soon
forgot
your
lesson
and
then
she
realized
that
the
twenty
blind
men
were
closing
in
on
her
they
were
silent
but
their
outstretched
hands
were
feeling
for
something
that
they
wanted
very
much
even
when
her
whip
started
to
cut
they
were
silent
then
one
man
touched
her
to
her
credit
there
was
no
sign
of
fear
she
knew
what
had
happened
she
must
have
known
but
she
was
not
afraid
her
single
scream
was
nothing
but
the
battle-cry
of
the
tiger
cat
going
into
action
there
was
a
single
cry
and
that
was
all
the
men
reached
for
what
they
wanted
in
silence
for
a
while
they
were
all
in
a
struggling
group
on
their
feet
but
soon
they
were
all
on
the
ground
it
was
simply
a
mass
and
under
that
mass
was
a
biting
scratching
fighting
dying
animal
i
couldn't
stand
it
i
had
planned
it
all
i
wanted
it
all
to
happen
but
when
it
came
i
just
couldn't
stand
it
covered
with
the
sweat
of
fear
i
ran
to
the
door
and
unlocked
it
i
swung
it
open
went
through
the
doorway
closed
it
and
locked
it
again
the
men
waiting
for
me
in
the
cellar
looked
on
with
doubt
it
seemed
that
they
were
right
in
thinking
that
my
tale
was
an
alcoholic
one
give
me
whisky
i
gasped
as
i
dropped
on
the
floor
in
a
few
minutes
i
had
recovered
open
the
door
i
ordered
and
bring
the
blind
men
out
one
at
a
time
they
were
brought
to
the
kitchen
and
identified
some
were
terribly
mutilated
in
the
face
long
deep
scratches
and
even
pieces
bitten
out
and
one
had
the
corner
of
his
mouth
torn
most
of
them
were
sobbing
hysterically
but
in
some
way
though
none
said
so
i
judged
that
they
were
all
happy
we
went
back
to
the
cellar
and
through
the
door
on
the
stone
floor
was
a
clotted
mass
of
red
and
white
what's
that
asked
the
american
consul
i
think
that
is
the
donna
marchesi
i
replied
she
must
have
met
with
an
accident
