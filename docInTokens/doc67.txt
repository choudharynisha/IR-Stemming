the
churchyard
in
which
arthur
lawford
found
himself
wandering
that
mild
and
golden
september
afternoon
was
old
green
and
refreshingly
still
the
silence
in
which
it
lay
seemed
as
keen
and
mellow
as
the
light--the
pale
almost
heatless
sunlight
that
filled
the
air
here
and
there
robins
sang
across
the
stones
elvishly
shrill
in
the
quiet
of
harvest
the
only
other
living
creature
there
seemed
to
lawford
to
be
his
own
rather
fair
not
insubstantial
rather
languid
self
who
at
the
noise
of
the
birds
had
raised
his
head
and
glanced
as
if
between
content
and
incredulity
across
his
still
and
solitary
surroundings
an
increasing
inclination
for
such
lonely
ramblings
together
with
the
feeling
that
his
continued
ill-health
had
grown
a
little
irksome
to
his
wife
and
that
now
that
he
was
really
better
she
would
be
relieved
at
his
absence
had
induced
him
to
wander
on
from
home
without
much
considering
where
the
quiet
lanes
were
leading
him
and
in
spite
of
a
peculiar
melancholy
that
had
welled
up
into
his
mind
during
these
last
few
days
he
had
certainly
smiled
with
a
faint
sense
of
the
irony
of
things
on
lifting
his
eyes
in
an
unusually
depressed
moodiness
to
find
himself
looking
down
on
the
shadows
and
peace
of
widderstone
with
that
anxious
irresolution
which
illness
so
often
brings
in
its
train
he
had
hesitated
for
a
few
minutes
before
actually
entering
the
graveyard
but
once
safely
within
he
had
begun
to
feel
extremely
loth
to
think
of
turning
back
again
and
this
not
the
less
at
remembering
with
a
real
foreboding
that
it
was
now
drawing
towards
evening
that
another
day
was
nearly
done
he
trailed
his
umbrella
behind
him
over
the
grass-grown
paths
staying
here
and
there
to
read
some
time-worn
inscription
stooping
a
little
broodingly
over
the
dark
green
graves
not
for
the
first
time
during
the
long
laborious
convalescence
that
had
followed
apparently
so
slight
an
indisposition
a
fleeting
sense
almost
as
if
of
an
unintelligible
remorse
had
overtaken
him
a
vague
thought
that
behind
all
these
past
years
hidden
as
it
were
from
his
daily
life
lay
something
not
yet
quite
reckoned
with
how
often
as
a
boy
had
he
been
rapped
into
a
galvanic
activity
out
of
the
deep
reveries
he
used
to
fall
into--those
fits
of
a
kind
of
fishlike
day-dream
how
often
and
even
far
beyond
boyhood
had
he
found
himself
bent
on
some
distant
thought
or
fleeting
vision
that
the
sudden
clash
of
self-possession
had
made
to
seem
quite
illusory
and
yet
had
left
so
strangely
haunting
and
now
the
old
habit
had
stirred
out
of
its
long
sleep
and
through
the
gate
that
influenza
in
departing
had
left
ajar
had
returned
upon
him
â€˜but
i
suppose
we
are
all
pretty
much
the
same
if
we
only
knew
itâ€™
he
had
consoled
himself
â€˜we
keep
our
crazy
side
to
ourselves
thatâ€™s
all
we
just
go
on
for
years
and
years
doing
and
saying
whatever
happens
to
come
up--and
really
keen
about
it
tooâ€™--he
had
glanced
up
with
a
kind
of
challenge
in
his
face
at
the
squat
little
belfry--â€˜and
then
without
the
slightest
reason
or
warning
down
you
go
and
it
all
begins
to
wear
thin
and
you
get
wondering
what
on
earth
it
all
meansâ€™
memory
slipped
back
for
an
instant
to
the
life
that
in
so
unusual
a
fashion
seemed
to
have
floated
a
little
aloof
fortunately
he
had
not
discussed
these
inward
symptoms
with
his
wife
how
surprised
sheila
would
be
to
see
him
loafing
in
this
old
crooked
churchyard
how
she
would
lift
her
dark
eyebrows
with
that
handsome
indifferent
tolerance
he
smiled
but
a
little
confusedly
yet
the
thought
gave
even
a
spice
of
adventure
to
the
eveningâ€™s
ramble
he
loitered
on
scarcely
thinking
at
all
now
stooping
here
and
there
these
faint
listless
ideas
made
no
more
stir
than
the
sunlight
gilding
the
fading
leaves
the
crisp
turf
underfoot
with
a
slight
effort
he
stooped
even
once
again--
â€˜stranger
a
moment
pause
and
stay
in
this
dim
chamber
hidden
away
lies
one
who
once
found
life
as
dear
as
now
he
finds
his
slumbers
here
pray
then
the
judgement
but
increase
his
deep
everlasting
peaceâ€™
â€˜but
then
do
you
know
you
lie
at
peaceâ€™
lawford
audibly
questioned
gazing
at
the
doggerel
and
yet
as
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
blunt
green
stone
and
the
rambling
crimson-berried
brier
that
had
almost
encircled
it
with
its
thorns
the
echo
of
that
whisper
rather
jarred
he
was
he
supposed
rather
a
dull
creature--at
least
people
seemed
to
think
so--and
he
seldom
felt
at
ease
even
with
his
own
small
facetiousness
besides
just
that
kind
of
question
was
getting
very
common
now
that
cleverness
was
the
fashion
most
people
were
clever--even
perfect
fools
and
cleverness
after
all
was
often
only
a
bore
all
head
and
no
body
he
turned
languidly
to
the
small
cross-shaped
stone
on
the
other
side
â€˜here
lies
the
body
of
ann
hard
who
died
in
child-bed
also
of
james
her
infant
sonâ€™
he
muttered
the
words
over
with
a
kind
of
mournful
bitterness
â€˜thatâ€™s
just
it--just
it
thatâ€™s
just
how
it
goesâ€™
he
yawned
softly
the
pathway
had
come
to
an
end
beyond
him
lay
ranker
grass
one
and
another
obscurer
mounds
an
old
scarred
oak
seat
shadowed
by
a
few
everlastingly
green
cypresses
and
coral-fruited
yew-trees
and
above
and
beyond
all
hung
a
pale
blue
arch
of
sky
with
a
few
voyaging
clouds
like
silvered
wool
and
the
calm
wide
curves
of
stubble
field
and
pasture
land
he
stood
with
vacant
eyes
not
in
the
least
aware
how
queer
a
figure
he
made
with
his
gloves
and
his
umbrella
and
his
hat
among
the
stained
and
tottering
gravestones
then
just
to
linger
out
his
hour
and
half
sunken
in
reverie
he
walked
slowly
over
to
the
few
solitary
graves
beneath
the
cypresses
one
only
was
commemorated
with
a
tombstone
a
rather
unusual
oval-headed
stone
carved
at
each
corner
into
what
might
be
the
heads
of
angels
or
of
pagan
dryads
blindly
facing
each
other
with
worn-out
sightless
faces
a
low
curved
granite
canopy
arched
over
the
grave
with
a
crevice
so
wide
between
its
stones
that
lawford
actually
bent
down
and
slid
in
his
gloved
fingers
between
them
he
straightened
himself
with
a
sigh
and
followed
with
extreme
difficulty
the
well-nigh
illegible
inscription
â€˜here
lie
ye
bones
of
one
nicholas
sabathier
a
stranger
to
this
parish
who
fell
by
his
own
hand
on
ye
eve
of
ste
michael
and
all
angels
mdccxxxix
of
the
date
he
was
a
little
uncertain
the
â€˜handâ€™
had
lost
its
â€˜nâ€™
and
â€˜dâ€™
and
all
the
â€˜angelsâ€™
rain
had
erased
he
was
not
quite
sure
even
of
the
â€˜strangerâ€™
there
was
a
great
rich
â€˜sâ€™
and
the
twisted
tail
of
a
â€˜gâ€™
and
whether
or
not
lawford
smilingly
thought
he
is
no
stranger
now
but
how
rare
and
how
memorable
a
name
french
evidently
probably
huguenot
and
the
huguenots
he
remembered
vaguely
were
a
rather
remarkable
â€˜crowdâ€™
he
had
he
thought
even
played
at
â€˜huguenotsâ€™
once
what
was
the
manâ€™s
name
coligny
yes
of
course
coligny
â€˜and
i
supposeâ€™
lawford
continued
muttering
to
himself
â€˜i
suppose
this
poor
beggar
was
put
here
out
of
the
way
they
might
you
knowâ€™
he
added
confidentially
raising
the
ferrule
of
his
umbrella
â€˜they
might
have
stuck
a
stake
through
you
and
buried
you
at
the
crossroadsâ€™
and
again
a
feeling
of
ennui
a
faint
disgust
at
his
poor
little
witticism
clouded
over
his
mind
it
was
a
pity
thoughts
always
ran
the
easiest
way
like
water
in
old
ditches
â€˜â€œhere
lie
ye
bones
of
one
nicholas
sabathierâ€â€™
he
began
murmuring
again--â€˜merely
bones
mind
you
brains
and
heart
are
quite
another
story
and
itâ€™s
pretty
certain
the
fellow
had
some
kind
of
brains
besides
poor
devil
he
killed
himself
that
seems
to
hint
at
brains
oh
for
goodnessâ€™
sakeâ€™
he
cried
out
so
loud
that
the
sound
of
his
voice
alarmed
even
a
robin
that
had
perched
on
a
twig
almost
within
touch
with
glittering
eye
intent
above
its
dim
red
breast
on
this
other
and
even
rarer
stranger
â€˜i
wonder
if
it
is
xxxix
it
might
be
lxxixâ€™
lawford
cast
a
cautious
glance
over
his
round
grey
shoulder
then
laboriously
knelt
down
beside
the
stone
and
peeped
into
the
gaping
cranny
there
he
encountered
merely
the
tiny
pale-green
faintly
conspicuous
eyes
of
a
large
spider
confronting
his
own
it
was
for
the
moment
an
alarming
and
yet
a
faintly
fascinating
experience
the
little
almost
colourless
fires
remained
so
changeless
but
still
even
when
at
last
they
had
actually
vanished
into
the
recesses
of
that
quiet
habitation
lawford
did
not
rise
from
his
knees
an
utterly
unreasonable
feeling
of
dismay
a
sudden
weakness
and
weariness
had
come
over
him
â€˜what
is
the
good
of
it
allâ€™
he
asked
himself
inconsequently--this
monotonous
restless
stupid
life
to
which
he
was
soon
to
be
returning
and
for
good
he
began
to
realize
how
ludicrous
a
spectacle
he
must
be
kneeling
here
amid
the
weeds
and
grass
beneath
the
solemn
cypresses
â€˜well
you
canâ€™t
have
everythingâ€™
seemed
loosely
to
express
his
disquiet
he
stared
vacantly
at
the
green
and
fretted
gravestone
dimly
aware
that
his
heart
was
beating
with
an
unusual
effort
he
felt
ill
and
weak
he
leant
his
hand
on
the
stone
and
lifted
himself
on
to
the
low
wooden
seat
nearby
he
drew
off
his
glove
and
thrust
his
bare
hand
under
his
waistcoat
with
his
mouth
a
little
ajar
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
dark
square
turret
its
bell
sharply
defined
against
the
evening
sky
â€˜deadâ€™
a
bitter
inward
voice
seemed
to
break
into
speech
â€˜deadâ€™
the
viewless
air
seemed
to
be
flocking
with
hidden
listeners
the
very
clearness
and
the
crystal
silence
were
their
ambush
he
alone
seemed
to
be
the
target
of
cold
and
hostile
scrutiny
there
was
not
a
breath
to
breathe
in
this
crisp
pale
sunshine
it
was
all
too
rare
too
thin
the
shadows
lay
like
wings
everlastingly
folded
the
robin
that
had
been
his
only
living
witness
lifted
its
throat
and
broke
as
if
from
the
uttermost
outskirts
of
reality
into
its
shrill
passionless
song
lawford
moved
heavy
eyes
from
one
object
to
another--bird--sun-gilded
stone--those
two
small
earth-worn
faces--his
hands--a
stirring
in
the
grass
as
of
some
creature
labouring
to
climb
up
it
was
useless
to
sit
here
any
longer
he
must
go
back
now
fancies
were
all
very
well
for
a
change
but
must
be
only
occasional
guests
in
a
world
devoted
to
reality
he
leaned
his
hand
on
the
dark
grey
wood
and
closed
his
eyes
the
lids
presently
unsealed
a
little
momentarily
revealing
astonished
aggrieved
pupils
and
softly
slowly
they
again
descended
the
flaming
rose
that
had
swiftly
surged
from
the
west
into
the
zenith
dyeing
all
the
churchyard
grass
a
wild
and
vivid
green
and
the
stooping
stones
above
it
a
pure
faint
purple
waned
softly
back
like
a
falling
fountain
into
its
basin
in
a
few
minutes
only
a
faint
orange
burned
in
the
west
dimly
illuminating
with
its
band
of
light
the
huddled
figure
on
his
low
wood
seat
his
right
hand
still
pressed
against
a
faintly
beating
heart
dusk
gathered
the
first
white
stars
appeared
out
of
the
shadowy
fields
a
nightjar
purred
but
there
was
only
the
silence
of
the
falling
dew
among
the
graves
down
here
under
the
ink-black
cypresses
the
blades
of
the
grass
were
stooping
with
cold
drops
and
darkness
lay
like
the
hem
of
an
enormous
cloak
whose
jewels
above
the
breast
of
its
wearer
might
be
in
the
unfathomable
clearness
the
glittering
constellations
in
his
small
cage
of
darkness
lawford
shuddered
and
raised
a
furtive
head
he
stood
up
and
peered
eagerly
and
strangely
from
side
to
side
he
stayed
quite
still
listening
as
raptly
as
some
wandering
night-beast
to
the
indiscriminate
stir
and
echoings
of
the
darkness
he
cocked
his
head
above
his
shoulder
and
listened
again
then
turned
upon
the
soundless
grass
towards
the
hill
he
felt
not
the
faintest
astonishment
or
strangeness
in
his
solitude
here
only
a
little
chilled
and
physically
uneasy
and
yet
in
this
vast
darkness
a
faint
spiritual
exaltation
seemed
to
hover
he
hastened
up
the
narrow
path
walking
with
knees
a
little
bent
like
an
old
labourer
who
has
lived
a
life
of
stooping
and
came
out
into
the
dry
and
dusty
lane
one
moment
his
instinct
hesitated
as
to
which
turn
to
take--only
a
moment
he
was
soon
walking
swiftly
almost
trotting
downhill
with
this
vivid
exaltation
in
the
huge
dark
night
in
his
heart
and
sheila
merely
a
little
angry
titianesque
cloud
on
a
scarcely
perceptible
horizon
he
had
no
notion
of
the
time
the
golden
hands
of
his
watch
were
indiscernible
in
the
gloom
but
presently
as
he
passed
by
he
pressed
his
face
close
to
the
cold
glass
of
a
little
shop-window
and
pierced
that
out
by
an
old
swiss
cuckoo-clock
he
would
if
he
hurried
just
be
home
before
dinner
he
broke
into
a
slow
steady
trot
gaining
speed
as
he
ran
on
vaguely
elated
to
find
how
well
his
breath
was
serving
him
an
odd
smile
darkened
his
face
at
remembrance
of
the
thoughts
he
had
been
thinking
there
could
be
little
amiss
with
the
heart
of
a
man
who
could
shamble
along
like
this
taking
even
pleasure
an
increasing
pleasure
in
this
long
wolf-like
stride
he
turned
round
occasionally
to
look
into
the
face
of
some
fellow-wayfarer
whom
he
had
overtaken
for
he
felt
not
only
this
unusual
animation
this
peculiar
zest
but
that
like
a
boy
on
some
secret
errand
he
had
slightly
disguised
his
very
presence
was
going
masked
as
it
were
even
his
clothes
seemed
to
have
connived
at
this
queer
illusion
no
tailor
had
for
these
ten
years
allowed
him
so
much
latitude
he
cautiously
at
last
opened
his
garden
gate
and
with
soundless
agility
mounted
the
six
stone
steps
his
latch-key
ready
in
his
gloveless
hand
and
softly
let
himself
into
the
house
sheila
was
out
it
seemed
for
the
maid
had
forgotten
to
light
the
lamp
without
pausing
to
take
off
his
greatcoat
he
hung
up
his
hat
ran
nimbly
upstairs
and
knocked
with
a
light
knuckle
on
his
bedroom
door
it
was
closed
but
no
answer
came
he
opened
it
shut
it
locked
it
and
sat
down
on
the
bedside
for
a
moment
in
the
darkness
so
that
he
could
scarcely
hear
any
other
sound
as
he
sat
erect
and
still
like
some
night
animal
wary
of
danger
attentively
alert
then
he
rose
from
the
bed
threw
off
his
coat
which
was
clammy
with
dew
and
lit
a
candle
on
the
dressing-table
its
narrow
flame
lengthened
drooped
brightened
gleamed
clearly
he
glanced
around
him
unusually
contented--at
the
ruddiness
of
the
low
fire
the
brass
bedstead
the
warm
red
curtains
the
soft
silveriness
here
and
there
it
seemed
as
if
a
heavy
and
dull
dream
had
withdrawn
out
of
his
mind
he
would
go
again
some
day
and
sit
on
the
little
hard
seat
beside
the
crooked
tombstone
of
the
friendless
old
huguenot
he
opened
a
drawer
took
out
his
razors
and
faintly
whistling
returned
to
the
table
and
lit
a
second
candle
and
still
with
this
strange
heightened
sense
of
life
stirring
in
his
mind
he
drew
his
hand
gently
over
his
chin
and
looked
unto
the
glass
for
an
instant
he
stood
head
to
foot
icily
still
without
the
least
feeling
or
thought
or
stir--staring
into
the
looking-glass
then
an
inconceivable
drumming
beat
on
his
ear
a
warm
surge
like
the
onset
of
a
wave
broke
in
him
flooding
neck
face
forehead
even
his
hands
with
colour
he
caught
himself
up
and
wheeled
deliberately
and
completely
round
his
eyes
darting
to
and
fro
suddenly
to
fix
themselves
in
a
prolonged
stare
while
he
took
a
deep
breath
caught
back
his
self-possession
and
paused
then
he
turned
and
once
more
confronted
the
changed
strange
face
in
the
glass
without
a
sound
he
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
just
as
he
was
frigid
and
appalled
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
to
sit
like
this
with
a
kind
of
incredibly
swift
torrent
of
consciousness
bearing
echoes
and
images
like
straws
and
bubbles
on
its
surface
could
not
be
called
thinking
some
stealthy
hand
had
thrust
open
the
sluice
of
memory
and
words
voices
faces
of
mockery
streamed
through
without
connection
tendency
or
sense
his
hands
hung
between
his
knees
a
deep
and
settled
frown
darkened
the
features
stooping
out
of
the
direct
rays
of
the
light
and
his
eyes
wandered
like
busy
and
inquisitive
but
stupid
animals
over
the
floor
if
in
that
flood
of
unintelligible
thoughts
anything
clearly
recurred
at
all
it
was
the
memory
of
sheila
he
saw
her
face
lit
transfigured
distorted
stricken
appealing
horrified
his
lids
narrowed
a
vague
terror
and
horror
mastered
him
he
hid
his
eyes
in
his
hands
and
cried
without
sound
without
tears
without
hope
like
a
desolate
child
he
ceased
crying
and
sat
without
stirring
and
it
seemed
after
an
age
of
vacancy
and
meaninglessness
he
heard
a
door
shut
downstairs
a
distant
voice
and
then
the
rustle
of
some
one
slowly
ascending
the
stairs
some
one
turned
the
handle
in
vain
tapped
â€˜is
that
you
arthurâ€™
for
an
instant
lawford
paused
then
like
a
child
listening
for
an
echo
answered
â€˜yes
sheilaâ€™
and
a
sigh
broke
from
him
his
voice
except
for
a
little
huskiness
was
singularly
unchanged
â€˜may
i
come
inâ€™
lawford
stood
softly
up
and
glanced
once
more
into
the
glass
his
lips
set
tight
and
a
slight
frown
settled
between
the
long
narrow
intensely
dark
eyes
â€˜just
one
moment
sheilaâ€™
he
answered
slowly
â€˜just
one
momentâ€™
â€˜how
long
will
you
beâ€™
he
stood
erect
and
raised
his
voice
gazing
the
while
impassively
into
the
glass
â€˜itâ€™s
no
useâ€™
he
began
as
if
repeating
a
lesson
â€˜itâ€™s
no
use
your
asking
me
sheila
please
give
me
a
moment
ai
am
not
quite
myself
dearâ€™
he
added
quite
gravely
the
faintest
hint
of
vexation
was
in
the
answer
â€˜what
is
the
matter
canâ€™t
i
help
itâ€™s
so
very
absurd--â€™
â€˜what
is
absurdâ€™
he
asked
dully
â€˜why
standing
like
this
outside
my
own
bedroom
door
are
you
ill
i
will
send
for
dr
simonâ€™
â€˜please
sheila
do
nothing
of
the
kind
i
am
not
ill
i
merely
want
a
little
time
to
think
inâ€™
there
was
again
a
brief
pause
and
then
a
slight
rattling
at
the
handle
â€˜arthur
i
insist
on
knowing
at
once
whatâ€™s
wrong
this
does
not
sound
a
bit
like
yourself
it
is
not
even
quite
like
your
own
voiceâ€™
â€˜it
is
myselfâ€™
he
replied
stubbornly
staring
fixedly
into
the
glass
you
must
give
me
a
few
moments
sheila
something
has
happened
my
face
come
back
in
an
hourâ€™
â€˜donâ€™t
be
absurd
itâ€™s
simply
wicked
to
talk
like
that
how
do
i
know
what
you
are
doing
as
if
i
can
leave
you
for
an
hour
in
uncertainty
your
face
if
you
donâ€™t
open
at
once
i
shall
believe
thereâ€™s
something
seriously
wrong
i
shall
send
ada
for
assistanceâ€™
â€˜if
you
do
that
sheila
it
will
be
disastrous
i
cannot
answer
for
the
con--
go
quietly
downstairs
say
i
am
unwell
donâ€™t
wait
dinner
for
me
come
back
in
an
hour
oh
half
an
hourâ€™
the
answer
broke
out
angrily
â€˜you
must
be
mad
beside
yourself
to
ask
such
a
thing
i
shall
wait
in
the
next
room
until
you
callâ€™
â€˜wait
where
you
pleaseâ€™
lawford
replied
â€˜but
tell
them
downstairsâ€™
â€˜then
if
i
tell
them
to
wait
until
half-past
eight
you
will
come
down
you
say
you
are
not
ill
the
dinner
will
be
ruined
itâ€™s
absurdâ€™
lawford
made
no
answer
he
listened
a
while
then
he
deliberately
sat
down
once
more
to
try
to
think
like
a
squirrel
in
a
cage
his
mind
seemed
to
be
aimlessly
unceasingly
astir
â€˜what
is
it
really
what
is
it
really--reallyâ€™
he
sat
there
and
it
seemed
to
him
his
body
was
transparent
as
glass
it
seemed
he
had
no
body
at
all--only
the
memory
of
an
hallucinatory
reflection
in
the
glass
and
this
inward
voice
crying
arguing
questioning
threatening
out
of
the
silence--â€˜what
is
it
really--really--reallyâ€™
and
at
last
cold
wearied
out
he
rose
once
more
and
leaned
between
the
two
long
candle-flames
and
stared
on--on--on
into
the
glass
he
gave
that
long
dark
face
that
had
been
foisted
on
him
tricks
to
do--lift
an
eyebrow
frown
there
was
scarcely
any
perceptible
pause
between
the
wish
and
its
performance
he
found
to
his
discomfiture
that
the
face
answered
instantaneously
to
the
slightest
emotion
even
to
his
fainter
secondary
thoughts
as
if
these
unfamiliar
features
were
not
entirely
within
control
he
could
not
in
fact
without
the
glass
before
him
tell
precisely
what
that
face
was
expressing
he
was
still
it
seemed
keenly
sane
that
he
would
discover
for
certain
when
sheila
returned
terror
rage
horror
had
fallen
back
if
only
he
felt
ill
or
was
in
pain
he
would
have
rejoiced
at
it
he
was
simply
caught
in
some
unheard-of
snare--caught
how
when
where
by
whom
but
the
coolness
and
deliberation
of
his
scrutiny
had
to
a
certain
extent
calmed
lawfordâ€™s
mind
and
given
him
confidence
hitherto
he
had
met
the
little
difficulties
of
life
only
to
vanquish
them
with
ease
and
applause
now
he
was
standing
face
to
face
with
the
unknown
he
burst
out
laughing
into
a
long
low
helpless
laughter
then
he
arose
and
began
to
walk
softly
swiftly
to
and
fro
across
the
room--from
wall
to
wall
seven
paces
and
at
the
fourth
that
awful
unseen
brightly-lit
profile
passed
as
swiftly
over
the
tranquil
surface
of
the
looking-glass
the
power
of
concentration
was
gone
again
he
simply
paced
on
mechanically
listening
to
a
babel
of
questions
a
conflicting
medley
of
answers
but
above
all
the
confusion
and
turmoil
of
his
brain
as
a
boatswainâ€™s
whistle
rises
above
a
storm
so
sounded
that
same
infinitesimal
voice
incessantly
repeating
another
question
now
â€˜what
are
you
going
to
do
what
are
you
going
to
doâ€™
and
in
the
midst
of
this
confusion
out
of
the
infinite
as
it
were
came
another
sharp
tap
at
the
door
and
all
within
sank
to
utter
stillness
again
â€˜itâ€™s
nearly
half-past
eight
arthur
i
canâ€™t
wait
any
longerâ€™
lawford
cast
a
last
fleeting
look
into
the
glass
turned
and
confronted
the
closed
door
â€˜very
well
sheila
you
shall
not
wait
any
longerâ€™
he
crossed
over
to
the
door
and
suddenly
a
swift
crafty
idea
flashed
into
his
mind
he
tapped
on
the
panel
â€˜sheilaâ€™
he
said
softly
â€˜i
want
you
first
before
you
come
in
to
get
me
something
out
of
my
old
writing-desk
in
the
smoking-room
here
is
the
keyâ€™
he
pushed
a
tiny
key--from
off
the
ring
he
carried--beneath
the
door
â€˜in
the
third
little
drawer
from
the
top
on
the
left
side
is
a
letter
please
donâ€™t
say
anything
now
it
is
the
letter
you
wrote
me
you
will
remember
after
i
had
asked
you
to
marry
me
you
scribbled
in
the
corner
under
your
signature
the
initials
â€œysoaâ€--do
you
remember
they
meant
you
silly
old
arthur--do
you
remember
will
you
please
get
that
letter
at
onceâ€™
â€˜arthurâ€™
answered
the
voice
from
without
empty
of
all
expression
â€˜what
does
all
this
mean
this
mystery
this
hopeless
nonsense
about
a
silly
letter
what
has
happened
is
this
a
miserable
form
of
persecution
are
you
mad--i
refuse
to
get
the
letterâ€™
lawford
stooped
black
and
angular
against
the
door
â€˜i
am
not
mad
oh
i
am
in
the
deadliest
earnest
sheila
you
must
get
the
letter
if
only
for
your
own
peace
of
mindâ€™
he
heard
his
wife
hesitate
as
she
turned
he
heard
a
sob
and
once
more
he
waited
â€˜i
have
brought
the
letterâ€™
came
the
low
toneless
voice
again
â€˜have
you
opened
itâ€™
there
was
a
rustle
of
paper
â€˜are
the
letters
there
underlined
three
times--â€œysoaâ€â€™
â€˜the
letters
are
thereâ€™
â€˜and
the
date
of
the
month
is
underneath
â€œapril
3rdâ€
no
one
else
in
the
whole
world
living
or
dead
could
know
of
this
but
ourselves
sheilaâ€™
â€˜will
you
please
open
the
doorâ€™
â€˜no
oneâ€™
â€˜i
suppose
not--no
oneâ€™
â€˜then
come
inâ€™
he
unlocked
the
door
and
opened
it
a
dark
rather
handsome
woman
with
sleek
hair
in
a
silk
dress
of
a
dark
rich
colour
entered
lawford
closed
the
door
but
his
face
was
in
shadow
he
had
still
a
momentâ€™s
respite
â€˜i
need
not
ask
you
to
be
patientâ€™
he
began
quickly
â€˜if
i
could
possibly
have
spared
you--if
there
had
been
anybody
in
the
world
to
go
to
i
am
in
horrible
horrible
trouble
sheila
it
is
inconceivable
i
said
i
was
sane
so
i
am
but
the
fact
is--i
went
out
for
a
walk
it
was
rather
stupid
perhaps
so
soon
and
i
think
i
was
taken
ill
or
something--my
heart
a
kind
of
fit
a
nervous
fit
possibly
i
am
a
little
unstrung
and
itâ€™s
all
itâ€™s
mainly
fancy
but
i
think
i
canâ€™t
help
thinking
it
has
a
little
distorted--changed
my
face
everything
sheila
except
of
course
myself
would
you
mind
lookingâ€™
he
walked
slowly
and
with
face
averted
towards
the
dressing-table
â€˜simply
a
nervous--to
make
such
a
fuss
to
scareâ€™
began
his
wife
following
him
without
a
word
he
took
up
the
two
old
china
candlesticks
and
held
them
one
in
each
lank-fingered
hand
before
his
face
and
turned
lawford
could
see
his
wife--every
tint
and
curve
and
line
as
distinctly
as
she
could
see
him
her
cheeks
never
had
much
colour
now
her
whole
face
visibly
darkened
from
pallor
to
a
dusky
leaden
grey
as
she
gazed
it
was
not
an
illusion
then
not
a
miserable
hallucination
the
unbelievable
the
inconceivable
had
happened
he
replaced
the
candles
with
trembling
fingers
and
sat
down
â€˜wellâ€™
he
said
â€˜what
is
it
really
what
is
it
really
sheila
what
on
earth
are
we
to
doâ€™
â€˜is
the
door
lockedâ€™
she
whispered
he
nodded
with
eyes
fixed
stirlessly
on
his
face
sheila
unsteadily
seated
herself
a
little
out
of
the
candlelight
in
the
shadow
lawford
rose
and
put
the
key
of
the
door
on
his
wifeâ€™s
little
rose-wood
prayer-desk
at
her
elbow
and
deliberately
sat
down
again
â€˜you
said
â€œa
fitâ€--whereâ€™
â€˜i
suppose--is--is
it
very
different--hopeless
you
will
understand
my
being
o
sheila
what
am
i
to
doâ€™
his
wife
sat
perfectly
still
watching
him
with
unflinching
attention
â€˜you
gave
me
to
understand--â€œa
nervous
fitâ€
whereâ€™
lawford
took
a
deep
breath
and
quietly
faced
her
again
â€˜in
the
old
churchyard
widderstone
i
was
looking
at--at
the
gravestonesâ€™
â€˜a
fit
in
the
old
churchyard
widderstone--you
were
â€œlooking
at
the
gravestonesâ€â€™
lawford
shut
his
mouth
â€˜i
suppose
so--a
fitâ€™
he
said
presently
â€˜my
heart
went
a
little
queer
and
i
sat
down
and
fell
into
a
kind
of
doze--a
stupor
i
suppose
i
donâ€™t
remember
anything
more
and
then
i
woke
like
thisâ€™
â€˜how
do
you
knowâ€™
â€˜how
do
i
know
whatâ€™
â€˜â€œlike
thatâ€â€™
he
turned
slowly
towards
the
looking-glass
â€˜why
here
i
amâ€™
she
gazed
at
him
steadily
and
a
hard
incredulous
almost
cunning
glint
came
into
her
wide
blue
eyes
she
took
up
the
key
carelessly
glanced
at
it
glanced
at
him
â€˜it
has
made
me--i
mean
the
first
shock
you
know--it
has
made
me
a
little
faintâ€™
she
walked
slowly
deliberately
to
the
door
and
unlocked
it
â€˜iâ€™ll
get
a
little
sal
volatileâ€™
she
softly
drew
out
the
key
and
without
once
removing
her
eyes
from
his
face
opened
the
door
and
pushed
the
key
noiselessly
in
on
the
other
side
â€˜please
stay
there
i
wonâ€™t
be
a
minuteâ€™
lawfordâ€™s
face
smiled--a
rather
desperate
yet
for
all
that
a
patient
resolute
smile
â€˜oh
yes
of
courseâ€™
he
said
almost
to
himself
â€˜i
had
not
foreseen--at
least--you
must
do
precisely
what
you
please
sheila
you
were
going
to
lock
me
in
you
will
however
before
taking
any
final
step
please
think
over
what
it
will
entail
i
did
not
think
you
would
after
such
proof
in
this
awful
trouble--i
did
not
think
you
would
simply
disbelieve
me
sheila
who
else
is
there
to
help
me
you
have
the
letter
in
your
hand
isnâ€™t
that
sufficient
proof
it
was
overwhelming
proof
to
me
and
even
i
doubted
too
doubted
myself
but
never
mind
why
i
should
have
dreamed
you
would
believe
me
or
taken
this
awful
thing
differently
i
donâ€™t
know
itâ€™s
rather
awful
to
have
to
go
on
alone
but
there
think
it
over
i
shall
not
stir
until
i
hear
the
voices
and
then
honestly
sheila
i
couldnâ€™t
face
quite
that
iâ€™d
sooner
give
up
altogether
any
proof
you
can
think
of--i
will

god
i
cannot
bear
itâ€™
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
but
in
a
moment
looked
up
unmoved
once
more
â€˜why
for
that
matterâ€™
he
added
slowly
and
as
it
were
with
infinite
pains
a
faint
thin
smile
again
stealing
into
his
face
â€˜i
thinkâ€™
he
turned
wearily
to
the
glass
â€˜i
think
itâ€™s
almost
an
improvementâ€™
something
deep
in
those
dark
clear
pupils
out
of
that
lean
adventurous
face
gleamed
back
at
him
the
distant
flash
of
a
heliograph
as
it
were
height
to
height
flashing
â€˜courageâ€™
he
shuddered
and
shut
his
eyes
â€˜but
i
would
really
ratherâ€™
he
aided
in
a
quiet
childlike
way
â€˜i
would
really
rather
sheila
you
left
me
alone
nowâ€™
his
wife
stood
irresolute
â€˜i
understand
you
to
explainâ€™
she
said
â€˜that
you
went
out
of
this
house
just
your
usual
self
this
afternoon
for
a
walk
that
for
some
reason
you
went
to
widderstone--â€œto
read
the
tombstonesâ€
that
you
had
a
heart
attack
or
as
you
said
at
first
a
fit
that
you
fell
into
a
stupor
and
came
home
like--like
this
am
i
likely
to
believe
all
that
am
i
likely
to
believe
such
a
story
as
that
whoever
you
are
whoever
you
may
be
is
it
likely
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
i
thought
at
first
it
was
some
silly
practical
joke
i
thought
that
at
firstâ€™
she
paused
but
no
answer
came
â€˜well
i
suppose
in
a
civilised
country
there
is
a
remedy
even
for
a
joke
as
wicked
as
thatâ€™
lawford
listened
patiently
â€˜she
is
pretending
she
is
trying
me
she
is
feeling
her
wayâ€™
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
â€˜she
knows
i
am

but
hasnâ€™t
the
courage

her
talkâ€™
â€˜i
shall
leave
the
door
openâ€™
sheila
continued
â€˜i
am
not
as
you
no
doubt
very
naturally
assumed--i
am
not
going
to
do
anything
either
senseless
or
heedless
i
am
merely
going
to
ask
your
brother
cecil
to
come
in
if
he
is
at
home
and
if
not
no
doubt
our
old
friend
mr
montgomery
would--would
help
usâ€™
her
scrutiny
was
still
and
concentrated
like
that
of
a
cat
above
a
mouseâ€™s
hole
lawford
sat
crouched
together
in
the
candle-light
â€˜by
all
means
sheilaâ€™
he
said
slowly
choosing
his
words
â€˜if
you
think
poor
old
cecil
who
next
january
will
have
been
three
years
in
his
grave
will
be
of
any
use
in
our
difficulty
who
mr
montgomery
isâ€™
his
voice
dropped
in
utter
weariness
â€˜you
did
it
very
well
my
dearâ€™
he
added
softly
sheila
gently
closed
the
door
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
he
heard
her
softly
crying
he
heard
the
bed
shaken
with
her
sobs
but
a
slow
glance
towards
the
steady
candle-flames
restrained
him
he
let
her
cry
on
alone
when
she
had
become
a
little
more
composed
he
stood
up
â€˜you
have
had
no
dinnerâ€™
he
managed
to
blurt
out
at
last
â€˜you
will
be
faint
itâ€™s
useless
to
talk
even
to
think
any
more
to-night
leave
me
to
myself
for
a
while
donâ€™t
look
at
me
any
more
perhaps
i
can
sleep
perhaps
if
i
sleep
it
will
come
right
again
when
the
servants
are
gone
up
i
will
come
down
just
let
me
have
some--some
medical
book
or
other
and
some
more
candles
donâ€™t
think
sheila
donâ€™t
even
thinkâ€™
sheila
paid
him
no
attention
for
a
while
â€˜you
tell
me
not
to
thinkâ€™
she
began
in
a
low
almost
listless
voice
â€˜why--i
wonder
i
am
in
my
right
mind
and
â€œeatâ€
how
can
you
have
the
heartlessness
to
suggest
it
you
donâ€™t
seem
in
the
least
to
realize
what
you
say
you
seem
to
have
lost
all--all
consciousness
i
quite
agree
it
is
useless
for
me
to
burden
you
with
my
company
while
you
are
in
your
present
condition
of
mind
but
you
will
at
least
promise
me
that
you
wonâ€™t
take
any
further
steps
in
this
awful
businessâ€™
she
could
not
try
as
she
would
bring
herself
again
to
look
at
him
she
rose
softly
paused
a
moment
with
sidelong
eyes
then
turned
deliberately
towards
the
door
â€˜what
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
all
thisâ€™
from
behind
her
that
voice
so
extraordinarily
like--and
yet
in
some
vague
fashion
more
arresting
more
resonant
than
her
husbandâ€™s
broke
incredibly
out
once
more
â€˜you
will
please
leave
the
key
sheila
i
am
ill
but
i
am
not
yet
in
the
padded
room
and
please
understand
i
take
no
further
steps
in
â€œthis
awful
businessâ€
until
i
hear
a
strange
voice
in
the
houseâ€™
sheila
paused
but
the
quiet
voice
rang
in
her
ear
desperately
yet
convincingly
she
took
the
key
out
of
the
lock
placed
it
on
the
bed
and
with
a
sigh
that
was
not
quite
without
a
hint
of
relief
in
its
misery
she
furtively
extinguished
the
gas-light
on
the
landing
and
rustled
downstairs
she
speedily
returned
â€˜i
have
brought
the
bookâ€™
she
said
hastily
â€˜i
could
only
find
the
one
volume
i
have
said
you
have
taken
a
fresh
chill
no
one
will
disturb
youâ€™
lawford
took
the
book
without
a
word
and
once
more
with
eyes
stonily
averted
his
wife
left
him
to
his
own
company
and
that
of
the
face
in
the
glass
when
completely
deserted
lawford
with
fumbling
fingers
opened
quainâ€™s
â€˜dictionary
of
medicineâ€™
he
had
never
had
much
curiosity
and
had
always
hated
what
he
disbelieved
but
none
the
less
he
had
heard
occasionally
of
absurd
and
questionable
experiments
he
remembered
even
to
have
glanced
over
reports
of
cases
in
the
newspapers
concerning
disappearances
loss
of
memory
dual
personality
cranks
oh
yes
he
thought
now
with
a
sense
of
cold
humiliating
relief
there
had
been
such
cases
as
his
before
they
were
no
doubt
curable
they
must
be
comparatively
common
in
america--that
land
of
jangled
nerves
possibly
bromide
rest
a
battery
but
quain
it
seemed
shared
his
prejudices
at
least
in
this
edition
or
had
hidden
away
all
such
apocryphal
matter
beneath
technical
terms
where
no
sensible
man
could
find
it
â€˜besidesâ€™
he
muttered
angrily
â€˜whatâ€™s
the
good
of
your
one
volumeâ€™
he
flung
it
down
and
strode
to
the
bed
and
rang
the
bell
then
suddenly
recollecting
himself
he
paused
and
listened
there
came
a
tap
on
the
door
â€˜is
that
you
sheilaâ€™
he
called
doubtfully
â€˜no
sir
itâ€™s
meâ€™
came
the
answer
â€˜oh
donâ€™t
trouble
i
only
wanted
to
speak
to
your
mistress
itâ€™s
all
rightâ€™
â€˜mrs
lawford
has
gone
out
sirâ€™
replied
the
voice
â€˜gone
outâ€™
â€˜yes
sir
she
told
me
not
to
mention
it
but
i
suppose
as
you
asked--â€™
â€˜oh
thatâ€™s
all
right
never
mind
i
didnâ€™t
ringâ€™
he
stood
with
face
uplifted
thinking
â€˜can
i
do
anything
sirâ€™
came
the
faint
nervous
question
after
a
long
pause
â€˜one
moment
adaâ€™
he
called
in
a
loud
voice
he
took
out
his
pocket-book
sat
down
and
scribbled
a
little
note
he
hardly
noticed
how
changed
his
handwriting
was--the
clear
round
letters
crabbed
and
irregular
â€˜are
you
there
adaâ€™
he
called
â€˜i
am
slipping
a
note
beneath
the
door
just
draw
back
the
mat
thatâ€™s
it
take
it
at
once
please
to
mr
critchettâ€™s
and
be
sure
to
wait
for
an
answer
then
come
back
direct
to
me
up
here
i
donâ€™t
think
ada
your
mistress
believes
much
in
critchett
but
i
have
fully
explained
what
i
want
he
has
made
me
up
many
prescriptions
explain
that
to
his
assistant
if
he
is
not
there
go
at
once
and
you
will
be
back
before
she
is
i
should
be
so
very
much
obliged
tell
him
â€œmr
arthur
lawfordâ€â€™
the
minutes
slowly
drifted
by
he
sat
quite
still
in
the
clear
untroubled
light
waiting
in
the
silence
of
the
empty
house
and
for
the
first
time
he
was
confronted
with
the
cold
incredible
horror
of
his
ordeal
who
would
believe
who
could
believe
that
behind
this
strange
and
awful
yet
how
simple
mask
lay
himself
what
test
what
heaped-up
evidence
of
identity
would
break
it
down
it
was
all
a
loathsome
ignominy
it
was
utterly
absurd
it
was--
suddenly
with
a
kind
of
ape-like
cunning
he
deliberately
raised
a
long
lean
forefinger
and
pointed
it
at
the
shadowy
crystal
of
the
looking-glass
perhaps
he
was
dead
was
really
and
indeed
changed
in
body
was
fated
really
and
indeed
to
change
in
soul
into
that
â€˜itâ€™s
that
beastly
voice
againâ€™
lawford
cried
out
loud
looking
vacantly
at
his
upstretched
finger
and
then
hand
and
arm
not
too
willingly
as
it
were
obeyed
relaxed
and
fell
to
his
side
â€˜you
must
keep
a
tight
hold
old
manâ€™
he
muttered
to
himself
â€˜once
once
you
lose
yourself--the
least
symptom
of
that--the
least
symptom
and
itâ€™s
all
upâ€™
and
the
fools
the
heartless
preposterous
fools
had
brought
him
one
volume
when
on
earth
was
ada
coming
back
she
was
lagging
on
purpose
she
was
in
the
conspiracy
too
oh
it
should
be
a
lesson
to
sheila
oh
if
only
daylight
would
come
â€˜what
are
you
going
to
do--to
do--to
doâ€™
he
rose
once
more
and
paced
his
silent
cage
to
and
fro
thinking
no
more
just
using
his
eyes
compelling
them
to
wander
from
picture
to
picture
bedpost
to
bedpost
now
counting
aloud
his
footsteps
now
humming
only
only
to
keep
himself
from
thinking
at
last
he
took
out
a
drawer
and
actually
began
arranging
its
medley
of
contents
ties
letters
studs
concert
and
theatre
programmes--all
higgledy-piggledy
and
in
the
midst
of
this
childish
strategem
he
heard
a
faint
sound
as
of
heavy
water
trickling
from
a
height
he
turned
a
thief
was
in
one
of
the
candles
it
was
guttering
out
he
would
be
left
in
darkness
he
turned
hastily
without
a
momentâ€™s
heed
to
call
for
light
flung
the
door
open
and
full
in
the
flare
of
a
lamp
illuminating
her
pale
forehead
and
astonished
face
beneath
her
black
straw
hat
stood
face
to
face
with
ada
with
one
swift
dexterous
movement
he
drew
the
door
to
after
him
looking
straight
into
her
almost
colourless
steady
eyes
â€˜ahâ€™
he
said
instantly
in
a
high
faint
voice
â€˜the
powder
thank
you
yes
mr
lawfordâ€™s
powder
thank
you
thank
you
he
must
be
kept
absolutely
quiet--absolutely
mrs
lawford
is
following
please
tell
her
that
i
am
here
when
she
returns
mr
critchett
was
in
then
thank
you
extreme
extreme
silence
pleaseâ€™
again
that
knotted
melodramatic
finger
raised
itself
on
high
and
within
that
lean
cadaverous
body
the
soul
of
its
lodger
quailed
at
this
spectral
boldness
but
it
was
triumphant
the
maid
at
once
left
him
and
went
downstairs
he
heard
faint
voices
in
muffled
consultation
and
in
a
moment
sheilaâ€™s
silks
rustled
once
more
on
the
staircase
lawford
put
down
the
lamp
and
watched
her
deliberately
close
the
door
â€˜what
does
this
meanâ€™
she
began
swiftly
â€˜i
understand
that--ada
tells
me
a
stranger
is
here
giving
orders
directions
who
is
he
where
is
he
you
bound
yourself
on
your
solemn
promise
not
to
stir
till
i
returned
you
how
can
i
how
can
we
get
decently
through
this
horrible
business
if
you
are
so
wretchedly
indiscreet
you
sent
ada
to
the
chemistâ€™s
what
for
what
for
i
sayâ€™
lawford
watched
his
wife
with
an
almost
extraneous
interest
she
was
certainly
extremely
interesting
from
that
point
of
view
that
very
novel
point
of
view
â€˜itâ€™s
quite
uselessâ€™
he
said
â€˜to
get
in
the
least
nervous
or
hysterical
i
donâ€™t
care
for
the
darkness
just
now
that
was
all
tell
the
girl
i
am
a
strange
doctor--dr
simonâ€™s
new
partner
you
are
clever
at
conventionalities
sheila
invent
i
said
our
patient
must
be
kept
quiet--i
really
think
he
must
that
is
all
so
far
as
ada
is
concerned
what
on
earth
else
are
we
to
sayâ€™
he
broke
out
â€˜that
for
the
present
to
everybody
is
our
only
possible
story
it
will
give
us
what
we
must
have--time
and
next--where
is
the
second
volume
of
quain
i
want
that
and
next--why
have
you
broken
faith
with
meâ€™
mrs
lawford
sat
down
this
sudden
and
baffling
outburst
had
stupefied
her
â€˜i
canâ€™t
i
canâ€™t
make
head
or
tail
of
what
you
say
and
as
for
having
broken
faith
as
you
call
it
would
any
wife
would
any
sane
woman
face
what
you
have
brought
on
us
a
situation
like
this
without
seeking
advice
and
help
mr
bethany
will
be
perfectly
discreet--if
he
thinks
discretion
desirable
he
is
the
only
available
friend
we
have
close
enough
to
ask
at
once
and
things
of
this
kind
are
i
suppose
if
anybodyâ€™s
concern
his
itâ€™s
certain
to
leak
out
everybody
will
hear
of
it
donâ€™t
flatter
yourself
you
are
going
to
hush
up
a
thing
like
this
for
long
you
canâ€™t
keep
living
skeletons
in
a
cupboard
you
think
only
of
yourself
only
of
your
own
misfortune
but
whoâ€™s
to
know
pray
that
you
really
are
my
husband--if
you
are
the
sooner
i
get
the
vicar
on
my
side
the
better
for
us
both
who
in
the
whole
of
the
parish--i
ask
you--and
you
must
have
the
sense
left
to
see
that--who
will
believe
that
a
respectable
man
a
gentleman
a
churchman
would
deliberately
go
out
to
seek
an
afternoonâ€™s
amusement
in
a
poky
little
country
churchyard
why
apart
from
everything
else
that
was
absolutely
mad
to
start
with
can
you
really
wonder
at
the
resultâ€™
probably
because
she
still
steadfastly
refused
to
look
at
him
her
memory
kept
losing
its
hold
on
the
appalling
fact
facing
them
she
realised
fully
only
that
she
was
in
a
great
unwarrantable
and
insurmountable
difficulty
but
until
she
actually
lifted
her
eyes
for
a
moment
she
had
not
fully
realised
what
that
difficulty
was
she
got
up
with
a
sudden
and
horrible
nausea
â€˜one
momentâ€™
she
said
â€˜i
will
see
if
the
servants
have
gone
to
bedâ€™
that
long
saturnine
face
behind
which
lawford
lay
in
a
dull
and
desperate
ambush
smiled
something
partaking
of
its
clay
some
reflex
ghost
of
its
rather
remarkable
features
was
even
a
little
amused
at
sheila
she
returned
in
a
moment
and
stood
in
profile
in
the
doorway
â€˜will
you
come
downâ€™
she
remarked
distantly
â€˜one
moment
sheilaâ€™
lawford
began
miserably
â€˜before
we
take
this
irrevocable
step
a
step
i
implore
you
to
postpone
awhile--for
what
comes
i
suppose
may
go--what
precisely
have
you
told
the
vicar
i
must
in
fairness
know
thatâ€™
â€˜in
fairnessâ€™
she
began
ironically
and
suddenly
broke
off
her
husband
had
turned
the
flame
of
the
lamp
low
down
in
the
vacant
room
behind
them
the
corridor
was
lit
obscurely
by
the
chandelier
far
down
in
the
hall
below
a
faint
inexplicable
dread
fell
softly
and
coldly
on
her
heart
â€˜have
you
no
trust
in
meâ€™
she
murmured
a
little
bitterly
â€˜i
have
simply
told
him
the
truthâ€™
they
softly
descended
the
stairs
she
first
the
dark
figure
following
close
behind
her
mr
bethany
sat
awaiting
them
in
the
dining-room
a
large
heavily-furnished
room
with
a
great
benign
looking-glass
on
the
mantelpiece
a
marble
clock
and
with
rich
old
damask
curtains
fleecy
silver
hair
was
all
that
was
visible
of
their
visitor
when
they
entered
but
mr
bethany
rose
out
of
his
chair
when
he
heard
them
and
with
a
little
jerk
turned
sharply
round
thus
it
was
that
the
gold-spectacled
vicar
and
lawford
first
confronted
each
other
the
one
brightly
illuminated
the
other
framed
in
the
gloom
of
the
doorway
mr
bethanyâ€™s
first
scrutiny
was
timid
and
courteous
but
beneath
it
he
tried
to
be
keen
and
himself
hastened
round
the
table
almost
at
a
trot
to
obtain
as
delicately
as
possible
a
closer
view
but
lawford
having
shut
the
door
behind
him
had
gone
straight
to
the
fire
and
seated
himself
leaning
his
face
in
his
hands
mr
bethany
smiled
faintly
waved
his
hand
almost
as
if
in
blessing
but
certainly
in
peace
and
tapped
mrs
lawford
into
the
chair
upon
the
other
side
but
he
himself
remained
standing
â€˜mrs
lawford
has
i
declare
been
telling
family
secretsâ€™
he
began
and
paused
peering
but
there
you
will
forgive
an
old
friendâ€™s
intrusion--this
little
confidence
about
a
change
my
dear
fellow--about
a
ramble
and
a
changeâ€™
he
sat
down
put
up
his
kind
little
puckered
face
and
peered
again
at
lawford
and
then
very
hastily
at
his
wife
but
all
her
attention
was
centred
on
the
bowed
figure
opposite
to
her
lawford
responded
to
this
cautious
advance
without
raising
his
head
â€˜you
do
not
wish
me
to
repeat
all
that
my
wife
tells
me
she
has
told
youâ€™
â€˜dear
me
noâ€™
said
mr
bethany
cheerfully
â€˜i
wish
nothing
nothing
old
friend
you
must
not
burden
yourself
with
me
if
i
may
be
of
any
help
here
i
am
oh
no
noâ€™
he
paused
with
blinking
eyes
but
wits
still
shrewd
and
alert
why
doesnâ€™t
the
man
raise
his
head
he
thought
a
mere
domestic
dispute
â€˜i
thoughtâ€™
he
went
on
ruminatingly
â€˜i
thought
on
tuesday
yes
on
tuesday
that
you
werenâ€™t
looking
quite
the
thing
indeed
i
remarked
on
it
but
now
i
understand
from
mrs
lawford
that
the
malady
has
taken
a
graver
turn--eh
lawford
an
heretical
turn
i
hear
you
have
been
wandering
from
the
true
foldâ€™
mr
bethany
leaned
forward
with
what
might
be
described
as
a
very
large
smile
in
a
very
small
compass
â€˜and
that
of
course
entailed
instant
retributionâ€™
he
broke
off
solemnly
â€˜i
know
widderstone
churchyard
well
a
most
verdant
and
beautiful
spot
the
late
rector
a
mr
strickland
was
a
very
old
friend
of
mine
and
his
wife
dear
good
alicia
used
to
set
out
her
babies
in
the
morning
to
sleep
and
to
play
there
twenty
dear
me
perhaps
twenty-five
years
ago
but
i
did
not
know
my
dear
lawford
that
you--â€™
and
suddenly
without
an
instantâ€™s
warning
something
seemed
to
shout
at
him
â€˜look
look
he
is
looking
at
youâ€™
he
stopped
faltered
and
a
slight
warmth
came
into
his
face
â€˜and
and
you
were
taken
ill
thereâ€™
his
voice
had
fallen
flat
and
faint
â€˜i
fell
asleep--or
something
of
that
sortâ€™
came
the
stubborn
reply
â€˜yesâ€™
said
mr
bethany
brightly
â€˜so
your
wife
was
saying
â€œfell
asleepâ€
so
have
i
too--scores
of
timesâ€™
he
beamed
with
beads
of
sweat
glistening
on
his
forehead
â€˜and
then
iâ€™m
not
iâ€™m
not
persistingâ€™
â€˜then
i
woke
refreshed
i
think
as
it
seemed--i
felt
much
better
and
came
homeâ€™
â€˜ah
yesâ€™
said
his
visitor
and
after
that
there
was
a
long
brightly
lit
intense
pause
at
the
end
of
which
lawford
raised
his
face
and
again
looked
firmly
at
his
friend
mr
bethany
was
now
a
shrunken
old
man
he
sat
perfectly
still
his
head
craned
a
little
forward
and
his
veined
hands
clutching
his
bent
spare
knees
there
wasnâ€™t
the
least
sign
of
devilry
or
out-facingness
or
insolence
in
that
lean
shadowy
steady
head
and
yet
he
himself
was
compelled
to
sidle
his
glance
away
so
much
the
face
shook
him
he
closed
his
eyes
too
as
a
cat
does
after
exchanging
too
direct
a
scrutiny
with
human
eyes
he
put
out
towards
and
withdrew
a
groping
hand
from
mrs
lawford
â€˜is
itâ€™
came
a
voice
from
somewhere
â€˜is
it
a
great
change
sir
i
thought
perhaps
i
may
have
exaggerated--candle-light
you
knowâ€™
mr
bethany
remained
still
and
silent
striving
to
entertain
one
thought
at
a
time
his
lips
moved
as
if
he
were
talking
to
himself
and
again
it
was
lawfordâ€™s
faltering
voice
that
broke
the
silence
â€˜you
seeâ€™
he
said
â€˜i
have
never
no
fit
or
anything
of
that
kind
before
i
remember
on
tuesday
oh
yes
quite
well
i
did
feel
seedy
very
and
we
talked
didnâ€™t
we--harvest
festival
mrs
wineâ€™s
flowers
the
new
offertory-bags
and
all
that
for
godâ€™s
sake
vicar
it
is
not
as
bad
as--as
they
make
outâ€™
mr
bethany
woke
with
a
start
he
leaned
forward
and
stretched
out
a
long
black
wrinkled
sleeve
just
managing
to
reach
far
enough
to
tap
lawfordâ€™s
knee
â€˜donâ€™t
worry
donâ€™t
worryâ€™
he
said
soothingly
â€˜we
believe
we
believeâ€™
it
was
none
the
less
a
sheer
act
of
faith
he
took
off
his
spectacles
and
took
out
his
handkerchief
â€˜what
we
must
do
eh
my
dearâ€™
he
half
turned
to
mrs
lawford
â€˜what
we
must
do
is
to
consult
yes
consult
together
and
later--we
must
have
advice--medical
advice
unless
as
i
very
much
suspect
it
is
merely
a
little
quite
temporary
physical
aberration
science
i
am
told
is
making
great
strides
experimenting
groping
after
things
which
no
sane
man
has
ever
dreamed
of
before--without
being
burned
alive
for
it
whatâ€™s
in
a
name
nerves
especially
lawfordâ€™
mrs
lawford
sat
perfectly
still
absorbedly
listening
turning
her
face
first
this
way
then
that
to
each
speaker
in
turn
â€˜that
is
what
i
thoughtâ€™
she
said
and
cast
one
fleeting
glance
across
at
the
fireplace
â€˜but--â€™
the
little
old
gentleman
turned
sharply
with
half-blind
eyes
and
lips
tight
shut
â€˜i
thinkâ€™
he
said
with
a
hind
of
austere
humour
â€˜i
think
do
you
know
i
see
no
â€œbutâ€â€™
he
paused
as
if
to
catch
the
echo
and
added
â€˜itâ€™s
our
only
courseâ€™
he
continued
to
polish
round
and
round
his
glasses
mrs
lawford
rather
magnificently
rose
â€˜perhaps
if
i
were
to
leave
you
together
awhile
i
shall
not
be
far
off
it
isâ€™
she
explained
as
if
into
a
huge
vacuum
â€˜it
is
a
terrible
visitationâ€™
she
moved
gravely
round
the
table
and
very
softly
and
firmly
closed
the
door
after
her
lawford
took
a
deep
breath
â€˜of
courseâ€™
he
said
â€˜you
realise
my
wife
does
not
believe
me
she
thinksâ€™
he
explained
naively
as
if
to
himself
â€˜she
thinks
i
am
an
imposter
goodness
knows
what
she
does
think
i
canâ€™t
think
much
myself--for
longâ€™
the
vicar
rubbed
busily
on
â€˜i
have
found
lawfordâ€™
he
said
smoothly
â€˜that
in
all
real
difficulties
the
only
feasible
plan
is--is
to
face
the
main
issue
the
others
right
themselves
now
to
take
a
plunge
into
your
generosity
you
have
let
me
in
far
enough
to
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
get
out--may
i
hear
then
exactly
the
whole
story
all
that
i
know
now
so
far
as
i
could
gather
from
your
wife
poor
soul
is
of
course
inconceivable
that
you
went
out
one
man
and
came
home
another
you
will
understand
my
dear
man
i
am
speaking
as
it
were
by
rote
god
has
mercifully
ordered
that
the
human
brain
works
slowly
first
the
blow
hours
afterwards
the
bruise
oh
dear
me
that
man
hume--â€œon
miraclesâ€--positively
amazing
so
that
too
please
you
will
be
quite
clear
about
credo--not
quia
impossible
est
but
because
you
lawford
have
told
me
now
then
if
it
wonâ€™t
be
too
wearisome
to
you
the
whole
storyâ€™
he
sat
lean
and
erect
in
his
big
chair
a
hand
resting
loosely
on
each
knee
in
one
spectacles
in
the
other
a
dangling
pocket
handkerchief
and
the
dark
sallow
aquiline
formidable
figure
with
its
oddly
changing
voice
re-told
the
whole
story
from
the
beginning
â€˜you
were
aware
then
of
nothing
different
i
understand
until
you
actually
looked
into
the
glassâ€™
â€˜only
vaguely
i
mean
that
after
waking
i
felt
much
better
more
alert
and
my
thoughts--â€™
â€˜ah
yes
your
thoughtsâ€™
â€˜i
hardly
know--oh
clear
as
if
i
had
had
a
real
long
rest
it
was
just
like
being
a
boy
again
influenza
dispirits
one
soâ€™
mr
bethany
gazed
without
stirring
â€˜and
yet
you
knowâ€™
he
said
â€˜i
can
hardly
believe
i
mean
conceive
how--you
have
been
taking
no
drugs
no
quackery
lawfordâ€™
â€˜i
never
dose
myselfâ€™
said
lawford
with
sombre
pride
â€˜god
bless
me
thatâ€™s
lawford
to
the
echoâ€™
thought
his
visitor
â€˜and
before--â€™
he
went
on
gently
â€˜i
really
cannot
conceive
you
see
how
a
mere
fit
could
before
you
sat
down
you
were
quite
aloneâ€™
he
stuck
out
his
head
â€˜there
was
nobody
with
youâ€™
â€˜with
me
oh
noâ€™
came
the
soft
answer
â€˜what
had
you
been
thinking
of
in
these
days
of
faith-cures
and
hypnotism
and
telepathy
and
subliminalities--why
the
simple
old
world
grows
very
confusing
but
rarely
very
rarely
novel
you
were
thinking
you
say
do
you
remember
perhaps
just
the
driftâ€™
â€˜wellâ€™
began
lawford
ruminatingly
â€˜there
was
something
curious
even
then
perhaps
i
remember
for
instance
i
knelt
down
to
read
an
old
tombstone
there
was
a
little
seat--no
back
and
an
epitaph
the
sun
was
just
setting
some
french
name
and
there
was
a
long
jagged
crack
in
the
stone
like
the
black
line
you
know
one
sees
after
lightning
i
mean
itâ€™s
as
clear
as
that
even
now
in
memory
oh
yes
i
remember
and
then
i
suppose
came
the
sleep--stupid
sluggish
and
then
well
here
i
amâ€™
â€˜you
are
absolutely
certain
thenâ€™
persisted
mr
bethany
almost
querulously
â€˜there
was
no
living
creature
near
you
bless
me
lawford
i
see
no
unkindness
in
believing
what
the
bible
itself
relates
there
are
powers
supernatural
saul
and
so
on
we
are
all
convinced
of
that
no
oneâ€™
â€˜i
remember
distinctlyâ€™
replied
lawford
in
a
calm
stubborn
voice
â€˜i
looked
up
all
around
me
while
i
was
kneeling
there
and
there
wasnâ€™t
a
soul
to
be
seen
because
you
see
it
even
then
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
have
looked
rather
queer--my
wandering
about
like
that
i
mean
facing
me
there
were
some
cypress-trees
and
beyond
a
low
sunken
fence
and
then
just
open
country
up
above
there
were
the
gravestones
toppling
down
the
hill
where
i
had
just
strolled
down
and
sunshineâ€™
he
suddenly
threw
up
his
hand
â€˜oh
marvellous
streaming
in
gold--flaming
like
godâ€™s
own
ante-chamberâ€™
there
was
a
very
pregnant
pause
mr
bethany
shrunk
back
a
little
into
his
chair
his
lips
moved
he
folded
his
spectacles
â€˜yes
yesâ€™
he
said
and
then
very
quietly
he
stole
one
mole-like
look
into
his
sidesmanâ€™s
face
â€˜what
is
dr
simonâ€™s
numberâ€™
he
said
lawford
was
gazing
gloomily
into
the
fire
â€˜oh
annandaleâ€™
he
replied
absently
â€˜i
donâ€™t
know
the
numberâ€™
â€˜do
you
believe
in
him
your
wife
mentioned
him
is
he
cleverâ€™
â€˜oh
heâ€™s
newâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜old
james
was
our
doctor
he--he
killed
my
fatherâ€™
he
laughed
out
shamefacedly
â€˜a
sound
lovable
manâ€™
said
mr
bethany
â€˜one
of
the
kindest
men
i
ever
knew
and
a
very
old
friend
of
mineâ€™
and
suddenly
the
dark
face
turned
with
a
shudder
from
the
fire
and
spoke
in
a
low
trembling
voice
â€˜only
one
thing--only
one
thing--my
sanity
my
sanity
if
once
i
forget
who
will
believe
meâ€™
he
thrust
his
long
lean
fingers
beneath
his
coat
â€˜and
madâ€™
he
added
â€˜i
would
sooner
dieâ€™
mr
bethany
deliberately
adjusted
his
spectacles
â€˜may
i
may
i
experimentâ€™
he
said
boldly
there
came
a
tap
on
the
door
â€˜bless
meâ€™
said
the
vicar
taking
out
his
watch
â€˜it
is
a
quarter
to
twelve
â€˜yes
yes
mrs
lawfordâ€™
he
trotted
round
to
the
door
â€˜we
are
beginning
to
see
light--a
rayâ€™
â€˜but
i--i
can
see
in
the
darkâ€™
whispered
lawford
as
if
at
a
cue
turning
with
an
inscrutable
smile
to
the
fire
the
vicar
came
again
wrapped
up
in
a
little
tight
grey
great-coat
and
a
white
silk
muffler
he
looked
up
unflinching
into
lawfordâ€™s
face
and
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
â€˜patience
patience
my
dear
fellowâ€™
he
repeated
gravely
squeezing
his
hand
â€˜and
rest
complete
rest
is
imperative
just
till
the
first
thing
to-morrow
and
till
thenâ€™
he
turned
to
mrs
lawford
where
she
stood
looking
in
at
the
doorway
â€˜oh
yes
complete
quiet
and
cautionâ€™
mrs
lawford
let
him
out
he
shook
his
head
once
or
twice
holding
her
fingers
â€˜oh
yesâ€™
he
whispered
â€˜it
is
your
husband
not
the
smallest
doubt
i
tried
for
myself
but
something--something
has
happened
donâ€™t
fret
him
now
have
patience
oh
yes
it
is
incredible
the
change
but
there
the
very
first
thing
to-morrowâ€™
she
closed
the
door
gently
after
him
and
stepping
softly
back
to
the
dining-room
peered
in
her
husbandâ€™s
back
was
turned
but
he
could
see
her
in
the
looking-glass
stooping
a
little
with
set
face
watching
him
in
the
silvery
stillness
â€˜wellâ€™
he
said
â€˜is
the
old--â€™
he
doggedly
met
the
fixed
eyes
facing
him
there
â€˜is
our
old
friend
goneâ€™
â€˜yesâ€™
said
sheila
â€˜heâ€™s
goneâ€™
lawford
sighed
and
turned
round
â€˜itâ€™s
useless
talking
now
sheila
no
more
questions
i
cannot
tell
you
how
tired
i
am
and
my
head--â€™
â€˜what
is
wrong
with
your
headâ€™
inquired
his
wife
discreetly
the
haggard
face
turned
gravely
and
patiently
â€˜only
one
of
my
old
headachesâ€™
he
smiled
â€˜my
old
bilious
headaches--the
hereditary
lawford
varietyâ€™
but
his
voice
fell
low
again
â€˜we
must
get
to
bedâ€™
with
a
rather
pretty
and
childish
movement
sheila
gently
drew
her
hands
across
her
silk
skirts
â€˜yes
dearâ€™
she
said
â€˜i
have
made
up
a
bed
for
you
in
the
large
spare
room
it
is
thoroughly
airedâ€™
she
came
softly
in
hastened
over
to
a
closed
work-table
that
stood
under
the
curtains
and
opened
it
lawford
watched
her
utterly
expressionless
utterly
motionless
he
opened
his
mouth
and
shut
it
again
still
watching
his
wife
as
she
stooped
with
ridiculously
too
busy
fingers
searching
through
her
coloured
silks
again
he
opened
his
mouth
â€˜yesâ€™
he
said
and
stalked
slowly
towards
the
door
but
there
he
paused
â€˜god
knowsâ€™
he
said
strangely
and
meekly
â€˜i
am
sorry
sorry
for
all
this
you
will
forgive
me
sheilaâ€™
she
looked
up
swiftly
â€˜itâ€™s
very
tiresome
i
canâ€™t
find
anywhereâ€™
she
murmured
â€˜i
canâ€™t
find
anywhere
the--the
little
red
box
keyâ€™
lawfordâ€™s
cheek
turned
more
sallow
than
ever
â€˜you
are
only
pretending
to
look
for
itâ€™
he
said
â€˜to
try
me
we
both
know
perfectly
well
the
lock
is
broken
ada
broke
itâ€™
sheila
let
fall
the
lid
and
yet
for
a
while
her
eyes
roved
over
it
as
if
in
violent
search
for
something
then
she
turned
â€˜i
am
so
very
glad
the
vicar
was
at
homeâ€™
she
said
brightly
â€˜and
mind
mind
you
rest
arthur
thereâ€™s
nothing
so
bad
but
it
might
be
worse
oh
i
canâ€™t
i
canâ€™t
bear
itâ€™
she
sat
down
in
the
chair
and
huddled
her
face
between
her
hands
sobbing
on
and
on
without
a
tear
lawford
listened
and
stared
solemnly
â€˜whatever
it
may
be
sheila
i
will
be
loyalâ€™
he
said
her
sobs
hushed
and
again
cold
horror
crept
over
her
nobody
in
the
whole
world
could
have
said
that
â€˜i
will
be
loyalâ€™
quite
like
that--nobody
but
arthur
she
stood
up
patting
her
hair
â€˜i
donâ€™t
think
my
brain
would
bear
much
more
itâ€™s
useless
to
talk
if
you
will
go
up
i
will
put
out
the
lampâ€™
one
solitary
and
tall
candle
burned
on
the
great
dressing-table
faint
solitary
pictures
broke
the
blankness
of
each
wall
the
carpet
was
rich
the
bed
impressive
and
the
basins
on
the
washstand
as
uninviting
as
the
bed
lawford
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
it
in
complete
isolation
he
sat
without
stirring
listening
to
his
watch
ticking
in
his
pocket
the
china
clock
on
the
chimney
piece
pointed
cheerfully
to
the
hour
of
dawn
it
was
exactly
he
computed
carefully
five
hours
and
seven
minutes
fast
not
the
slightest
sound
broke
the
stillness
until
he
heard
very
very
softly
and
gradually
the
key
of
his
door
turn
in
the
oiled
wards
and
realized
that
he
was
a
prisoner
women
were
strange
creatures
how
often
he
had
heard
that
said
he
thought
lamely
he
felt
no
anger
no
surprise
or
resentment
at
the
trick
it
was
only
to
be
expected
he
could
sit
on
till
morning
easily
till
morning
he
had
never
noticed
before
how
empty
a
well-furnished
room
could
seem
it
was
his
own
room
too
his
best
visitorsâ€™
room
his
father-in-law
had
slept
here
with
his
whiskers
on
that
pillow
his
wifeâ€™s
most
formidable
aunt
had
been
all
night
here
alone
with
these
pictures
she
certainly
was
â€˜but
what
are
you
doing
hereâ€™
cried
a
voice
suddenly
out
of
his
reverie
he
started
up
and
stretched
himself
and
taking
out
the
neat
little
packet
that
the
maid
had
brought
from
the
chemistâ€™s
he
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
once
more
in
front
of
the
glass
he
sighed
vacantly
rose
and
lifted
down
from
the
wall
above
the
fireplace
a
tinted
photograph
of
himself
that
sheila
had
had
enlarged
about
twelve
years
ago
it
was
a
brighter
younger
hairier
but
unmistakably
the
same
dull
indolent
lawford
who
had
ventured
into
widderstone
churchyard
that
afternoon
the
cheek
was
a
little
plumper
the
eyes
not
quite
so
full-lidded
the
hair
a
little
more
precisely
parted
the
upper
lip
graced
with
a
small
blonde
moustache
he
tilted
the
portrait
into
the
candlelight
and
compared
it
with
this
reflection
in
the
glass
of
what
had
come
out
of
widderstone
feature
with
feature
with
perfect
composure
and
extreme
care
then
he
laid
down
the
massive
frame
on
the
table
and
gazed
quietly
at
the
tiny
packet
it
was
to
be
a
day
of
queer
experiences
he
had
never
before
realized
with
how
many
miracles
mere
everyday
life
is
besieged
here
in
this
small
punctilious
packet
lay
a
sesame--a
power
of
transformation
beside
which
the
transformation
of
that
rather
flaccid
face
of
the
noonday
into
this
tense
sinister
face
of
midnight
was
but
as
a
moving
from
house
to
house--a
change
just
as
irrevocable
and
complete
and
yet
so
very
normal
which
should
it
be
that
or--his
face
lifted
itself
once
more
to
the
ice-like
gloom
of
the
looking-glass-that
or
this
it
simply
gazed
back
with
a
kind
of
quizzical
pity
on
its
lean
features
under
the
scrutiny
of
eyes
so
deep
so
meaningful
so
desolate
and
yet
so
indomitably
courageous
in
the
brain
behind
them
a
slow
and
stolid
argument
was
in
progress
the
one
baffling
reply
on
the
one
side
to
every
appeal
on
the
other
being
still
simply
â€˜what
dreams
may
comeâ€™
those
eyes
surely
knew
something
of
dreams
else
why
this
violent
and
stubborn
endeavour
to
keep
awake
lawford
did
indeed
once
actually
frame
the
question
â€˜but
who
the
devil
are
youâ€™
and
it
really
seemed
the
eyes
perceptibly
widened
or
brightened
the
mere
vexation
of
his
unparalleled
position
sheilaâ€™s
pathetic
incredulity
his
old
vicarâ€™s
laborious
kindness
the
tiresome
network
of
experience
into
which
he
would
be
dragged
struggling
on
the
morrow
and
on
the
morrow
after
that
and
after
that--the
thought
of
all
these
things
faded
for
the
moment
from
his
mind
lost
if
not
their
significance
at
least
their
instancy
he
simply
sat
face
to
face
with
the
sheer
difficulty
of
living
on
at
all
he
even
concluded
in
a
kind
of
lethargy
that
if
nothing
had
occurred
no
â€˜changeâ€™
he
might
still
be
sitting
here
arthur
rennet
lawford
in
his
best
visitorâ€™s
room
deciding
between
inscrutable
life
and
just--death
he
supposed
he
was
tired
out
his
thoughts
hadnâ€™t
even
the
energy
to
complete
themselves
none
cared
but
himself
and
this--this
silence
â€˜but
what
does
it
all
meanâ€™
the
insistent
voice
he
was
getting
to
know
so
well
began
tediously
inquiring
again
and
every
time
he
raised
his
eyes
or
rather
as
in
many
cases
it
seemed
his
eyes
raised
themselves
they
saw
this
haunting
face
there--a
face
he
no
longer
bitterly
rebelled
at
nor
dimmed
with
scrutiny
but
a
face
that
was
becoming
a
kind
of
hold
on
life
even
a
kind
of
refuge
an
ally
it
was
a
face
that
might
have
come
out
of
a
rather
flashy
book
or
such
as
is
revered
on
the
stage
â€˜a
rotten
bad
faceâ€™
he
whispered
at
it
in
his
own
familiar
slang
after
some
such
abrupt
encounter
a
fearless
packed
daring
fascinating
face
with
even--what--a
spice
of
genius
in
it
whose
the
devilâ€™s
face
was
it
what
on
earth
was
the
matter
â€˜brazen
it
outâ€™
a
jubilant
thought
cried
suddenly
â€˜follow
it
up
play
the
game
give
me
just
one
opening
think--think
what
iâ€™ve
riskedâ€™
and
all
these
voices
thought
lawford
in
deadly
lassitude
meant
only
one
thing--insanity
a
blazing
impotent
indignation
seized
him
he
leaned
near
peering
as
it
were
out
of
a
red
dusky
mist
he
snatched
up
the
china
candlestick
and
poised
it
above
the
sardonic
reflection
as
if
to
throw
then
slowly
with
infinite
pains
he
drew
back
from
the
glass
and
replaced
the
candlestick
on
the
table
stuffed
his
paper
packet
into
his
pocket
took
off
his
boots
and
threw
himself
on
to
the
bed
in
a
little
while
in
the
faint
still
light
he
opened
drowsily
wondering
eyes
poor
old
thingâ€™
his
voice
murmured
â€˜poor
old
sheilaâ€™
it
was
but
little
after
daybreak
when
mrs
lawford
after
listening
at
his
door
a
while
turned
the
key
and
looked
in
on
her
husband
blue-grey
light
from
between
the
venetian
blinds
just
dusked
the
room
she
stood
in
a
bluish
dressing-gown
her
hand
on
her
bosom
looking
down
on
the
lean
impassive
face
for
the
briefest
instant
her
heart
had
leapt
with
an
indescribable
surmise
to
fall
dull
as
lead
once
more
breathing
equably
and
quietly
the
strange
figure
lay
stretched
upon
the
bed
â€˜how
can
he
sleep
how
can
he
sleepâ€™
she
whispered
with
a
black
and
hopeless
indignation
what
a
night
she
had
had
and
he
she
turned
noiselessly
away
the
candle
had
guttered
to
extinction
the
big
glass
reflected
her
voluminous
and
wan
her
dark-ringed
eyes
full
lips
rich
glossy
hair
and
rounded
chin
â€˜yes
yesâ€™
it
seemed
to
murmur
mournfully
she
turned
away
and
drawing
stealthily
near
stooped
once
more
quite
low
and
examined
the
face
on
the
pillow
with
lynx-like
concentration
and
though
every
nerve
revolted
at
the
thought
she
was
finally
convinced
unwillingly
but
assuredly
that
her
husband
was
here
indeed
if
it
were
not
so
how
could
she
for
a
single
moment
have
accepted
the
possibility
that
he
was
a
stranger
he
seemed
to
haunt
like
a
ghostly
emanation
this
strange
detestable
face--as
memory
supplies
the
features
concealed
beneath
a
mask
the
face
was
still
and
stony
like
one
dead
or
imaged
in
wax
yet
beneath
it
dreams
were
passing--silly
ordinary
lawford
dreams
she
was
almost
alarmed
at
the
terribly
rancorous
hatred
she
felt
for
the
face
â€˜it
was
just
like
arthur
to
be
so
taken
inâ€™
then
she
too
remembered
quain
and
remembered
also
in
the
slowly
paling
dusk
that
the
house
would
soon
be
stirring
she
went
out
and
noiselessly
locked
the
door
again
but
it
was
useless
to
begin
looking
for
quain
now--her
husband
had
a
good
many
dull
books
most
of
them
his
â€˜eccentricâ€™
fatherâ€™s
what
must
the
servants
be
thinking
and
what
was
all
that
talk
about
a
mysterious
visitor
she
would
have
to
question
ada--diplomatically
she
returned
to
her
room
and
sat
down
in
an
arm-chair
and
waited
in
sheer
weariness
she
fell
into
a
doze
and
woke
at
the
sound
of
dustpan
and
broom
she
rang
the
bell
and
asked
for
hot
water
tea
and
a
basin
of
cornflour
â€˜and
please
ada
be
as
quiet
as
possible
over
your
work
your
master
is
in
a
nice
sleep
and
must
not
be
disturbed
on
any
account
in
the
front
bedroomâ€™
she
looked
up
suddenly
â€˜by
the
way
who
let
dr
ferguson
in
last
nightâ€™
it
was
dangerous
but
successful
â€˜dr
ferguson
maâ€™am
oh
you
mean
he
was
inâ€™
sheila
smiled
resignedly
â€˜was
in
what
do
you
mean
â€œwas
inâ€
and
where
were
you
thenâ€™
â€˜i
had
been
sent
out
to
critchettâ€™s
the
chemistâ€™sâ€™
â€˜of
course
of
course
so
cook
let
dr
ferguson
in
then
why
didnâ€™t
you
say
so
before
ada
and
did
you
bring
the
medicine
with
youâ€™
â€˜it
was
a
packet
in
an
envelope
maâ€™am
but
cook
is
sure
she
heard
no
knock--not
while
i
was
out
so
dr
ferguson
must
have
come
in
quite
unbeknownâ€™
â€˜well
reallyâ€™
said
sheila
â€˜it
seems
very
difficult
to
get
at
the
truth
sometimes
and
when
illness
is
in
the
house
i
cannot
understand
why
there
should
be
no
one
available
to
answer
the
door
you
must
have
left
it
ajar
unsecured
when
you
went
out
and
pray
what
if
dr
ferguson
had
been
some
common
tramp
that
would
have
been
a
nice
thingâ€™
â€˜i
am
quite
certainâ€™
said
ada
a
little
flatly
â€˜that
i
did
shut
the
door
and
cook
says
she
never
so
much
as
stirred
from
the
kitchen
till
i
came
down
the
area
steps
with
the
packet
and
thatâ€™s
all
i
know
about
it
maâ€™am
except
that
he
was
here
when
i
came
back
i
did
not
know
even
there
was
a
dr
ferguson
and
my
mother
has
lived
here
nineteen
yearsâ€™
â€˜we
must
be
thankful
your
mother
enjoys
such
good
healthâ€™
replied
mrs
lawford
suavely
â€˜please
tell
cook
to
be
very
careful
with
the
cornflour--to
be
sure
itâ€™s
well
mixed
and
thoroughly
doneâ€™
mrs
lawfordâ€™s
eyes
followed
with
a
certain
discomfort
those
narrow
print
shoulders
descending
the
stairs
and
this
abominable
ruse
was--arthurâ€™s
she
ran
up
lightly
and
listened
with
her
ear
to
the
panel
of
his
door
and
just
as
she
was
about
to
turn
away
again
there
came
a
little
light
knock
at
the
front
door
mrs
lawford
paused
at
the
loop
of
the
staircase
and
not
altogether
with
gratitude
or
relief
she
heard
the
voice
of
mr
bethany
inquiring
in
cautious
but
quite
audible
tones
after
her
husband
she
dressed
quickly
and
went
down
the
little
white
old
man
looked
very
solitary
in
the
long
fireless
drawing-room
â€˜i
could
not
sleepâ€™
he
said
â€˜i
donâ€™t
think
i
grasped
in
the
least
i
donâ€™t
indeed
until
i
was
nearly
home
the
complexity
of
our
problem
i
came
in
fact
to
a
lamppost
it
was
casting
a
peculiar
shadow
and
then--you
know
how
such
thoughts
seize
us
my
dear--like
a
sudden
inspiration
i
realised
how
tenuous
how
appallingly
tenuous
a
hold
we
every
one
of
us
have
on
our
mere
personality
but
thatâ€™
he
continued
rapidly
â€˜thatâ€™s
only
for
ourselves--and
after
the
event
ours
just
now
is
to
act
and
first--â€™
â€˜you
really
do
then--you
really
are
convinced--â€™
began
mrs
lawford
but
mr
bethany
was
too
quick
â€˜we
must
be
most
circumspect
my
dear
friend
we
must
be
most
circumspect
for
all
our
sakes
and
this
youâ€™ll
sayâ€™
he
added
smiling
stretching
out
his
arms
his
soft
hat
in
one
hand
his
umbrella
in
the
other--â€˜this
is
being
circumspect--a
seven
oâ€™clock
in
the
morning
call
but
you
see
my
dear
i
have
come
as
i
took
the
precaution
of
explaining
to
the
maid
because
itâ€™s
now
or
never
to-day
it
does
so
happen
that
i
have
to
take
a
wedding
for
an
old
friendâ€™s
niece
at
witchett
so
when
in
need
you
see
providence
enables
us
to
tell
even
the
conventional
truth
now
really
how
is
he
has
he
slept
has
he
recalled
himself
at
all
is
there
any
change--and
dear
me
how
are
youâ€™
mrs
lawford
sighed
â€˜a
broken
night
is
really
very
little
to
a
motherâ€™
she
said
â€˜he
is
still
asleep
he
hasnâ€™t
i
think
stirred
all
nightâ€™
â€˜not
stirredâ€™
mr
bethany
repeated
â€˜you
baffle
me
and
you
have
watchedâ€™
â€˜oh
noâ€™
was
the
cheerful
answer
â€˜i
felt
that
quiet
solitude
space
was
everything
he
preferred
it
so
he--he
changed
alone
i
suppose
donâ€™t
you
think
it
almost
stands
to
reason
that
he
will
be
alonewhen
he
comes
back
was
i
right
but
there
itâ€™s
useless
itâ€™s
worse
than
useless
to
talk
like
this
my
husband
is
gone
some
terrible
thing
has
happened
whatever
the
mystery
may
be
he
will
never
come
back
alive
my
only
fear
is
that
i
am
dragging
you
into
a
matter
that
should
from
the
beginning
have
been
entrusted
to--oh
itâ€™s
monstrousâ€™
it
appeared
for
a
moment
as
if
she
were
blinking
to
keep
back
her
tears
yet
her
scrutiny
seemed
merely
to
harden
only
the
merest
flicker
of
the
folded
eyelids
over
the
greenish
eyes
of
her
visitor
answered
the
challenge
he
stood
small
and
black
peeping
fixedly
out
of
the
window
at
the
sunflecked
laurels
â€˜last
nightâ€™
he
said
slowly
â€˜when
i
said
good-bye
to
your
husband
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
were
the
words
i
have
used
in
season
and
out
of
season
for
nearly
forty-five
years--â€œgod
knows
bestâ€
well
my
dear
lady
a
sense
of
humour
a
sense
of
reverence
or
perhaps
even
a
taint
of
scepticism--call
it
what
you
will--just
intercepted
them
oh
no
not
any
of
these
my
child
just
pity
overwhelming
pity
god
does
know
best
but
in
a
matter
like
this
it
is
not
even
my
place
to
say
so
it
would
be
good
for
none
of
us
to
endanger
our
souls
even
with
verbal
cant
now
if
do
you
think
i
had
just
five
minutesâ€™
talk--five
minutes
would
it
disquiet
himâ€™
only
by
an
almost
undignified
haste
for
the
vicar
was
remarkably
agile
sheila
managed
to
unlock
the
bedroom
door
without
apparently
his
perceiving
it
and
with
a
warning
finger
she
preceded
him
into
the
great
bedroom
â€˜oh
yes
yesâ€™
he
was
whispering
to
himself
â€˜alone--well
wellâ€™
he
hung
his
hat
on
his
umbrella
and
leaned
it
in
a
corner
and
then
he
turned
â€˜i
donâ€™t
think
you
know
an
old
friend
does
him
any
wrong
but
last
night
i
had
no
real
oppor--â€™
he
firmly
adjusted
his
spectacles
and
looked
long
into
the
dark
dispassioned
face
â€˜hâ€™mâ€™
he
said
and
fidgeted
and
peered
again
mrs
lawford
watched
him
keenly
â€˜do
you
still--â€™
she
began
but
at
the
same
moment
he
too
broke
silence
suddenly
stepping
back
with
the
innocent
remark
â€˜has
he--has
he
asked
for
anythingâ€™
â€˜only
for
quainâ€™
â€˜â€œquainâ€â€™
â€˜the
medical
dictionaryâ€™
â€˜oh
yes
bless
me
of
course
a
calm
complete
sleep
of
utter
prostration--utter
nervous
prostration
and
can
one
wonder
poor
fellow
poor
fellowâ€™
he
walked
to
the
window
and
peered
between
the
blinds
â€˜sparrows
sunshine--yes
and
hereâ€™s
the
postmanâ€™
he
said
as
if
to
himself
then
he
turned
sharply
round
with
mind
made
up
â€˜now
do
you
leave
me
hereâ€™
he
said
â€˜take
half
an
hourâ€™s
quiet
rest
he
will
be
glad
of
a
dull
old
fellow
like
me
when
he
wakes
and
as
for
my
pretty
bride
if
i
miss
the
train
she
must
wait
till
the
next
good
discipline
my
dear
oh
dear
me
i
donâ€™t
change
what
a
precious
experience
now
this
would
have
been
for
a
tottery
talkative
owlish
old
parochial
creature
like
me
but
there
there
light
words
make
heavy
hearts
i
see
i
shall
be
quite
comfortable
no
no
i
breakfasted
at
home
thereâ€™s
hat
and
umbrella
at
93
i
can
flyâ€™
mrs
lawford
thanked
him
mutely
he
smilingly
but
firmly
bowed
her
out
and
closed
the
door
but
eyes
and
brain
had
been
very
busy
he
had
looked
at
the

at
the
tinted
bland
portrait
on
the
dressing-table
at
the
chair
drawn-up
at
the
boots
and
now
again
he
turned
almost
with
a
groan
towards
the
sleeper
then
he
took
out
an
envelope
on
which
he
had
jotted
various
memoranda
and
waited
awhile
minutes
passed
and
at
last
the
sleeper
faintly
stirred
muttering
mr
bethany
stooped
quickly
â€˜what
is
it
what
is
itâ€™
he
whispered
lawford
sighed
â€˜i
was
only
dreaming
sheilaâ€™
he
said
and
softly
peacefully
opened
his
eyes
â€˜i
dreamed
i
was
in
the--
his
lids
narrowed
his
dark
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
the
anxious
spectacled
face
bending
over
him
â€˜mr
bethany
where
whatâ€™s
wrongâ€™
his
friend
put
out
his
hand
â€˜there
thereâ€™
he
said
soothingly
â€˜do
not
be
disturbed
do
not
disquiet
yourselfâ€™
lawford
struggled
up
slowly
painfully
consciousness
returned
to
him
he
glanced
furtively
round
the
room
at
his
clothes
slinkingly
at
the
vicar
licked
his
lips
flushed
with
extraordinary
rapidity
and
suddenly
burst
into
tears
mr
bethany
sat
without
movement
waiting
till
he
should
have
spent
himself
â€˜now
lawfordâ€™
he
said
gently
compose
yourself
old
friend
we
must
face
the
music--like
menâ€™
he
went
to
the
window
drew
up
the
blind
peeped
out
and
took
off
his
spectacles
â€˜the
first
thing
to
be
doneâ€™
he
said
returning
briskly
to
his
chair
â€˜is
to
send
for
simon
now
does
simon
know
you
wellâ€™
lawford
shook
his
head
â€˜would
he
recognise
you
i
meanâ€™
â€˜i
have
only
met
him
once--in
the
eveningâ€™
â€˜good
let
him
come
immediately
then
tell
him
just
the
facts
if
i
am
not
mistaken
he
will
pooh-pooh
the
whole
thing
tell
you
to
keep
quiet
not
to
worry
and
so
on
my
dear
fellow
if
we
realised
say
typhoid
whoâ€™d
dare
to
face
it
that
will
give
us
time
to
wait
a
while
to
recover
our
breath
to
see
what
happens
next
and
if--as
i
donâ€™t
believe
for
a
moment--why
in
that
case
i
heard
the
other
day
of
a
most
excellent
man--grosser
of
wimpole
street
nerves
he
would
be
absorbed
heâ€™ll
bottle
you
in
spirit
lawford
weâ€™ll
have
him
down
quietly
you
see
but
there
wonâ€™t
be
any
necessity
oh
no
by
then
light
will
have
come
we
shall
remember
what
i
mean
is
thisâ€™
he
crossed
his
legs
and
pushed
out
his
lips
â€˜we
are
on
quaky
ground
and
itâ€™s
absolutely
essential
that
you
keep
cool
and
trust
i
am
yours
heart
and
soul--you
know
that
i
own
frankly
at
first
i
was
shaken
and
i
have
i
confess
been
very
cunning
but
first
faith
then
evidence
to
bolster
it
up
the
faith
was
absoluteâ€™--he
placed
one
firm
hand
on
lawfordâ€™s
knee--â€˜why
i
cannot
explain
but
it
was
the
evidence
is
convincing
but
there
are
others
to
think
of
the
shock
the
incredibleness
the
consequences
we
must
not
scan
too
closely
think
with
never
against
and
bang
go
all
the
arguments
your
wife
poor
dear
believes
but
of
course
of
course
she
is
horribly--â€™
he
broke
off
â€˜of
course
she
is
shaken
you
old
simpleton
time
will
heal
all
that
time
will
wear
out
the
mask
time
will
tire
out
this
detestable
physical
witchcraft
the
mind
the
selfâ€™s
the
thing
old
fogey
though
i
may
seem
for
saying
it--that
must
be
kept
unsmirched
we
wonâ€™t
go
wearily
over
the
painful
subject
again
you
told
me
last
night
dear
old
friend
that
you
were
absolutely
alone
at
widderstone
that
is
enough
but
here
we
have
visible
facts
tangible
effects
and
there
must
have
been
a
definite
reason
and
a
cause
for
them
i
believe
in
the
devil
in
the
powers
of
darkness
lawford
as
firmly
as
i
believe
he
and
they
are
powerless--in
the
long
run
they--what
shall
we
say--have
surrendered
their
intrinsicality
you
can
just
go
through
evil
as
you
can
go
through
a
sewer
and
come
out
on
the
other
side
too
a
loathsome
process
too
but
there--we
are
not
speaking
of
any
such
monstrosities
and
even
if
we
were
you
and
i
with
godâ€™s
help
would
just
tire
them
out
and
that
ally
gone
our
poor
dear
old
mrs
grundy
will
at
once
capitulate
eh
ehâ€™
through
all
this
long
and
arduous
harangue
consciousness
like
the
gradual
light
of
dawn
had
been
flooding
that
other
brain
and
the
face
that
now
confronted
mr
bethany
though
with
his
feeble
unaided
sight
he
could
only
very
obscurely
discern
it
was
vigilant
and
keen
in
every
sharp-cut
hungry
feature
a
rather
prolonged
silence
followed
the
visitor
peering
mutely
the
black
eyes
nearly
closed
the
face
turned
slowly
towards
the
window
saw
burnt-out
candle
comprehensive
glass
â€˜yes
yesâ€™
he
said
â€˜iâ€™ll
send
for
simon
at
onceâ€™
â€˜goodâ€™
said
mr
bethany
and
more
doubtfully
repeated
â€˜goodâ€™
â€˜now
thereâ€™s
only
one
thing
leftâ€™
he
went
on
cheerfully
â€˜i
have
jotted
down
a
few
test
questions
here
they
are
questions
no
one
on
this
earth
could
answer
but
you
lawford
they
are
merely
for
external
proofs
you
wonâ€™t
you
canâ€™t
mistake
my
motive
we
cannot
foretell
or
foresee
what
need
may
arise
for
just
such
jog-trot
primitive
evidence
i
propose
that
you
now
answer
them
here
in
writingâ€™
lawford
stood
up
and
walked
to
the
looking-glass
and
paused
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
â€˜esâ€™
he
said
â€˜of
course
itâ€™s
a
rattling
good
move
iâ€™m
not
quite
awake
myself
i
mean
iâ€™ll
do
it
nowâ€™
he
took
out
a
pencil
case
and
tore
another
leaf
from
his
pocket-book
â€˜what
are
theyâ€™
mr
bethany
rang
the
bell
sheila
herself
answered
it
she
stood
on
the
threshold
and
looked
across
through
a
shaft
of
autumnal
sunshine
at
her
husband
and
her
husband
with
a
quiet
strange
smile
looked
across
through
the
sunshine
at
his
wife
mr
bethany
waited
in
vain
â€˜i
am
just
going
to
put
the
arch-impostor
through
his
credentialsâ€™
he
said
tartly
â€˜now
then
lawfordâ€™
he
read
out
the
questions
one
by
one
from
his
crafty
little
list
pursing
his
lips
between
each
and
one
by
one
lawford
seated
at
the
dressing-table
fluently
scribbled
his
answers
then
question
and
answer
were
rigorously
compared
by
mr
bethany
with
small
white
head
bent
close
and
spectacles
poised
upon
the
powerful
nose
and
signed
and
dated
and
passed
to
mrs
lawford
without
a
word
mrs
lawford
read
question
and
answer
where
she
stood
in
complete
silence
she
looked
up
â€˜many
of
these
questions
i
donâ€™t
know
the
answers
to
myselfâ€™
she
said
â€˜it
is
immaterialâ€™
said
mr
bethany
â€˜one
answer
is--is
inaccurate
â€˜yes
yes
quite
so
due
to
a
mistake
in
a
letter
from
myselfâ€™
mrs
lawford
read
quietly
on
folded
the
papers
and
held
them
out
between
finger
and
thumb
â€˜the--handwritingâ€™
she
remarked
very
softly
â€˜wonderful
isnâ€™t
itâ€™
said
mr
bethany
warmly
â€˜all
the
general
look
and
run
of
the
thing
different
but
every
real
essential
feature
unchanged
now
into
the
envelope
and
now
a
little
waxâ€™
mrs
lawford
stood
waiting
â€˜thereâ€™s
a
green
piece
of
sealing-waxâ€™
almost
drawled
the
quiet
voice
â€˜in
the
top
right
drawer
of
the
nest
in
the
study
which
old
james
gave
me
the
christmas
before
lastâ€™
he
glanced
with
lowered
eyelids
at
his
wifeâ€™s
flushed
cheek
their
eyes
met
â€˜thank
youâ€™
she
said
when
she
returned
the
vicar
was
sitting
in
a
chair
leaning
his
chin
on
the
knobbed
handle
of
his
umbrella
he
rose
and
lit
a
taper
for
her
with
a
match
from
a
little
green
pot
on
the
table
and
mrs
lawford
with
trembling
fingers
sealed
the
letter
as
he
directed
with
his
own
seal
â€˜thereâ€™
he
said
triumphantly
â€˜how
many
more
such
brilliant
lawyers
i
wonder
lie
dormant
in
the
church
and
who
shall
keep
this
why
all
three
of
courseâ€™
he
went
on
without
pausing
â€˜some
little
drawer
now
secret
and
undetectable
with
a
lockâ€™
just
such
a
little
drawer
that
locked
itself
with
a
spring
lay
by
chance
in
the
looking-glass
there
the
letter
was
hidden
and
mr
bethany
looked
at
his
watch
â€˜nineteen
minutesâ€™
he
said
â€˜the
next
thing
my
dear
child--weâ€™re
getting
on
swimmingly--and
itâ€™s
astonishing
how
things
are
simplified
by
mere
use--the
next
thing
is
to
send
for
simonâ€™
sheila
took
a
deep
breath
but
did
not
look
up
â€˜i
am
entirely
in
your
handsâ€™
she
replied
â€˜so
be
itâ€™
said
he
crisply
â€˜get
to
bed
lawford
itâ€™s
better
so
and
iâ€™ll
look
in
on
my
way
back
from
witchett
i
came
my
dear
fellow
in
gloomy
disturbance
of
mind
it
was
getting
up
too
early
it
fogs
old
brains
good-bye
good-byeâ€™
he
squeezed
lawfordâ€™s
hand
then
with
umbrella
under
his
arm
his
hat
on
his
head
his
spectacles
readjusted
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
mrs
lawford
followed
him
for
a
few
minutes
lawford
sat
motionless
with
head
bent
a
little
and
eyes
restlessly
scanning
the
door
then
he
rose
abruptly
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
was
in
bed
alone
with
his
slow
thoughts
while
a
basin
of
cornflour
stood
untasted
on
a
little
table
at
his
bedside
and
a
cheerful
fire
burned
in
the
best
visitorsâ€™
roomâ€™s
tiny
grate
at
half-past
eleven
dr
simon
entered
this
soundless
seclusion
he
sat
down
beside
lawford
and
took
temperature
and
pulse
then
he
half
closed
his
lids
and
scanned
his
patient
out
of
an
unusually
dark
un-english
face
with
straight
black
hair
and
listened
attentively
to
his
rather
incoherent
story
it
was
a
story
very
much
modified
and
rounded
off
nor
did
lawford
draw
dr
simonâ€™s
attention
to
the
portrait
now
smiling
conventionally
above
their
heads
from
the
wall
over
the
fireplace
â€˜it
was
rather
bleak--the
wind
and
i
think
perhaps
i
had
had
a
touch
of
influenza
it
was
a
silly
thing
to
do
but
still
dr
simon
one
doesnâ€™t
expect--well
there
i
donâ€™t
feel
the
same
man--physically
i
really
cannot
explain
how
great
a
change
has
taken
place
and
yet
i
feel
perfectly
fit
in
myself
and
if
it
were
not
for--for
being
laughed
at
go
back
to
town
to-day
why
my
wife
scarcely
recognised
meâ€™
dr
simon
continued
his
scrutiny
try
as
he
would
lawford
could
not
raise
his
downcast
eyes
to
meet
direct
the
doctorâ€™s
polite
attention
â€˜and
whatâ€™
said
dr
simon
â€˜what
precisely
is
the
nature
of
the
change
have
you
any
painâ€™
â€˜no
not
the
least
painâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜i
think
perhaps
or
rather
my
face
is
a
little
shrunken--and
yet
lengthened
at
least
it
feels
so
and
a
faint
twinge
of
rheumatism
but
my
hair--well
i
donâ€™t
know
itâ€™s
difficult
to
say
oneâ€™s
selfâ€™
he
could
get
on
so
very
much
better
he
thought
if
only
his
mind
would
be
at
peace
and
these
preposterous
promptings
and
voices
were
still
dr
simon
faced
the
window
and
drew
his
hand
softly
over
his
head
â€˜we
never
can
be
too
cautious
at
a
certain
age
and
especially
after
influenzaâ€™
he
said
â€˜it
undermines
the
whole
system
and
in
particular
the
nervous
system
leaving
the
mind
the
prey
of
the
most
melancholy
fancies
i
should
astound
you
mr
lawford
with
the
devil
influenza
plays
a
slight
nervous
shock
and
a
chill
quite
slight
i
hope
a
few
daysâ€™
rest
and
plenty
of
nourishment
thereâ€™s
nothing
temperature
inconsiderable
all
perfectly
intelligible
most
certainly
reassure
yourself
and
as
for
the
change
you
speak
ofâ€™--he
looked
steadily
at
the
dark
face
on
the
pillow
and
smiled
amiably--â€˜i
donâ€™t
think
we
need
worry
much
about
that
it
certainly
was
a
bleak
wind
yesterday--and
a
cemetery
my
dear
sir
it
was
indiscreet--yes
veryâ€™
he
held
out
his
hand
â€˜you
must
not
be
alarmedâ€™
he
said
very
distinctly
with
the
merest
trace
of
an
accent
â€˜air
sunshine
quiet
nourishment
sleep--that
is
all
the
little
window
might
be
a
few
inches
open
and--and
any
light
readingâ€™
he
opened
the
door
and
joined
mrs
lawford
on
the
staircase
he
talked
to
her
quietly
over
his
shoulder
all
the
way
downstairs
â€˜it
was
it
was
sporting
with
providence--a
wind
believe
me
nearly
due
east
in
spite
of
the
warm
sunshineâ€™
â€˜but
the
change--the
changeâ€™
mrs
lawford
managed
to
murmur
tragically
as
he
strode
to
the
door
dr
simon
smiled
and
gracefully
tapped
his
forehead
with
a
red-gloved
forefinger
â€˜humour
him
humour
himâ€™
he
repeated
indulgently
â€˜rest
and
quiet
will
soon
put
that
little
trouble
out
of
his
head
oh
yes
i
did
notice
it--the
set
drawn
look
and
the
droop
quite
so
good
morningâ€™
mrs
lawford
gently
closed
the
door
after
him
a
glimpse
of
ada
crossing
from
room
to
room
suggested
a
precaution
she
called
out
in
her
clearest
notes
â€˜if
dr
ferguson
should
call
while
i
am
out
ada
will
you
please
tell
him
that
dr
simon
regretted
that
he
was
unable
to
wait
thank
youâ€™
she
paused
with
hand
on
the
balusters
then
slowly
ascended
the
stairs
her
husbandâ€™s
face
was
turned
to
the
ceiling
his
hands
clasped
above
his
head
she
took
up
her
stand
by
the
fireplace
resting
one
silk-slippered
foot
on
the
fender
â€˜dr
simon
is
reassuringâ€™
she
said
â€˜but
i
do
hope
arthur
you
will
follow
his
advice
he
looks
a
fairly
clever
man
but
with
a
big
practice
do
you
think
dear
he
quite
realised
the
extent
of
the--the
changeâ€™
â€˜i
told
him
what
happenedâ€™
said
her
husbandâ€™s
voice
out
of
the
bed-clothes
â€˜yes
yes
i
knowâ€™
said
sheila
soothingly
â€˜but
we
must
remember
he
is
comparatively
a
stranger
he
would
not
detect--â€™
â€˜what
did
he
tell
youâ€™
asked
the
voice
mrs
lawford
deliberately
considered
if
only
he
would
always
thus
keep
his
face
concealed
how
much
easier
it
would
be
to
discuss
matters
rationally
â€˜you
see
dearâ€™
she
said
softly
â€˜i
know
of
course
nothing
about
the
nerves
but
personally
i
think
his
suggestion
absurd
no
mere
fancy
surely
can
make
a
lasting
alteration
in
oneâ€™s
face
and
your
hair--i
donâ€™t
want
to
say
anything
that
may
seem
unkind--but
isnâ€™t
it
really
quite
a
distinct
shade
darker
arthurâ€™
â€˜any
great
strain
will
change
the
colour
of
a
manâ€™s
hairâ€™
said
lawford
stolidly
â€˜at
any
rate
to
white
why
i
read
once
of
a
fellow
in
india
a
hindoo
or
something
who--â€™
â€˜but
have
you
had
any
intense
strain
or
anxietyâ€™
broke
in
sheila
â€˜you
might
at
least
have
confided
in
me
that
is
unless--but
there
donâ€™t
you
think
really
arthur
it
would
be
much
more
satisfactory
in
every
way
if
we
had
further
advice
at
once
alice
will
be
home
next
week
to-morrow
is
the
harvest
festival
and
next
week
of
course
the
dedication
and
in
any
case
the
bazaar
is
out
of
the
question
they
will
have
to
find
another
stall-holder
we
must
do
our
utmost
to
avoid
comment
or
scandal
every
minute
must
help
to--to
fix
a
thing
like
that
i
own
even
now
i
cannot
realise
what
this
awful
calamity
means
itâ€™s
useless
to
brood
on
it
we
must
as
the
poor
dear
old
vicar
said
only
last
night
keep
our
heads
clear
but
i
am
sure
dr
simon
was
under
a
misapprehension
if
now
it
was
explained
to
him
a
little
more
fully
arthur--a
photograph
oh
anything
on
earth
but
this
dreadful
wearing
uncertainty
and
suspense
besides
is
simon
quite
an
english
nameâ€™
lawford
drew
further
into
his
pillow
â€˜do
as
you
think
best
sheilaâ€™
he
said
â€˜for
my
own
part
i
believe
it
may
be
as
he
suggests--partly
an
illusion
a
touch
of
nervous
breakdown
it
simply
canâ€™t
be
as
bad
as
i
think
it
is
if
it
were
you
would
not
be
here
talking
like
this
and
bethany
wouldnâ€™t
have
believed
a
word
i
said
whatever
it
is
itâ€™s
no
good
crying
it
on
the
housetops
give
me
time
just
time
besides
how
do
we
know
what
he
really
thought
doctors
donâ€™t
tell
their
patients
everything
give
the
poor
chap
a
chance
and
more
so
if
he
is
a
foreigner
heâ€™sâ€™--his
voice
sank
almost
to
a
whisper--â€˜heâ€™s
no
darker
than
this
and
do
please
sheila
take
this
infernal
stuff
away
and
let
me
have
something
solid
iâ€™m
not
ill--in
that
way
all
i
want
is
peace
and
quiet
time
to
think
let
me
fight
it
out
alone
itâ€™s
been
sprung
on
me
the
worstâ€™s
not
over
but
iâ€™ll
win
through
wait
and
if
not--well
you
shall
not
suffer
sheila
donâ€™t
be
afraid
there
are
other
ways
outâ€™
sheila
broke
down
â€˜any
one
would
think
to
hear
you
talk
that
i
was
perfectly
heartless
i
told
ada
to
be
most
careful
about
the
cornflour
and
as
for
other
ways
out
itâ€™s
a
positively
wicked
thing
to
say
to
me
when
iâ€™m
nearly
distracted
with
trouble
and
anxiety
what
motive
could
you
have
had
for
loitering
in
an
old
cemetery
and
in
an
east
wind
itâ€™s
useless
for
me
to
remain
here
arthur
to
be
accused
of
every
horrible
thing
that
comes
into
a
morbid
imagination
i
will
leave
you
as
you
suggest
in
peaceâ€™
â€˜one
moment
sheilaâ€™
answered
the
muffled
voice
â€˜i
have
accused
you
of
nothing
if
you
knew
all
if
you
could
read
my
thoughts
you
would
be
surprised
perhaps
at
my--but
never
mind
that
on
the
other
hand
i
really
do
think
it
would
be
better
for
the
present
to
discuss
the
thing
no
more
to-day
is
friday
give
this
miserable
face
a
week
talk
it
over
with
bethany
if
you
like
but
i
forbidâ€™--he
struggled
up
in
bed
sallow
and
sinister--â€˜i
flatly
forbid
please
understand
any
other
interference
till
then
afterwards
you
must
do
exactly
as
you
please
send
round
the
town
crier
but
till
then
silenceâ€™
sheila
with
raised
head
confronted
him
â€˜this
then
is
your
gratitude
so
be
it
silence
no
doubt
until
itâ€™s
too
late
to
take
action
until
you
have
wormed
your
way
in
and
think
you
are
safe
to
have
believed
where
is
my
husband
that
is
what
i
am
asking
you
now
when
and
how
you
have
learned
his
secrets
god
only
knows
and
your
conscience
but
he
always
was
a
simpleton
at
heart
i
warn
you
then
until
next
thursday
i
consent
to
say
nothing
provided
you
remain
quiet
make
no
disturbance
no
scandal
here
the
servants
and
all
who
inquire
shall
simply
be
told
that
my
husband
is
confined
to
his
room
with--with
a
nervous
breakdown
as
you
have
yourself
so
glibly
suggested
i
am
at
your
mercy
i
own
it
the
vicar
believes
your
preposterous
story--with
his
spectacles
off
you
would
convince
anybody
with
the
wicked
cunning
with
which
you
have
cajoled
and
wheedled
him
with
which
you
have
deceived
and
fooled
a
foreign
doctor
but
you
will
not
convince
me
you
will
not
convince
alice
i
have
friends
in
the
world
though
you
may
not
be
aware
of
it
who
will
not
be
quite
so
apt
to
believe
any
cock-and-bull
story
you
may
see
fit
to
invent
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
to-night
i
tell
the
vicar
all
that
i
have
just
told
you
and
from
this
moment
please
we
are
strangers
i
shall
come
into
the
room
no
more
than
necessity
dictates
on
friday
we
resume
our
real
parts
my
husband--arthur--to--to
connive
at
phhâ€™
rage
had
transfigured
her
she
scarcely
heard
her
own
words
they
poured
out
senselessly
monotonously
one
calling
up
another
as
if
from
the
lips
of
a
cassandra
lawford
sank
back
into
bed
clutching
the
sheets
with
both
lean
hands
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
shut
his
mouth
â€˜it
reminds
me
sheilaâ€™
he
began
arduously
â€˜of
our
first
quarrel
before
we
were
married
the
evening
after
your
aunt
rose
died
at
llandudno--do
you
remember
you
threw
open
the
window
and
i
think--i
saved
your
lifeâ€™
a
pause
followed
then
a
queer
almost
inarticulate
voice
added
â€˜at
least
i
am
afraid
soâ€™
a
cold
and
awful
quietness
fell
on
sheilaâ€™s
heart
she
stared
fixedly
at
the
tuft
of
dark
hair
the
only
visible
sign
of
her
husband
on
the
pillow
then
taking
up
the
basin
of
cold
cornflour
she
left
the
room
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
reappeared
carrying
a
tray
with
ham
and
eggs
and
coffee
and
honey
invitingly
displayed
she
laid
it
down
â€˜there
is
only
one
other
questionâ€™
she
said
with
perfect
composure--â€˜that
of
money
your
signature
as
it
appears
on
the--the
document
drawn
up
this
morning
would
of
course
be
quite
useless
on
a
cheque
i
have
taken
all
the
money
i
could
find
it
is
in
safety
you
may
however
conceivably
be
in
need
of
some
yourself
here
is
five
pounds
i
have
my
own
cheque-book
and
shall
therefore
have
no
need
to
consider
the
question
again
for--for
the
present
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
i
shall
be
guided
solely
by
mr
bethany
he
will
i
do
not
doubt
take
full
responsibilityâ€™
â€˜and
may
the
lord
have
mercy
on
my
soulâ€™
uttered
a
stifled
unfamiliar
voice
from
the
bed
mrs
lawford
stooped
â€˜arthurâ€™
she
cried
faintly
â€˜arthurâ€™
lawford
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
with
a
sigh
that
was
very
near
to
being
a
sob
â€˜oh
sheila
if
youâ€™d
only
be
your
real
self
what
is
the
use
of
all
this
pretence
just
consider
my
position
a
little
the
fear
and
horror
are
not
all
on
your
side
you
called
me
arthur
even
then
iâ€™d
willingly
do
anything
you
wish
to
save
you
pain
you
know
that
canâ€™t
we
be
friends
even
in
this--this
ghastly--wonâ€™t
you
sheilaâ€™
mrs
lawford
drew
back
struggling
with
a
doubtful
heart
â€˜i
thinkâ€™
she
said
it
would
be
better
not
to
discuss
that
nowâ€™
the
rest
of
the
morning
lawford
remained
in
solitude
there
were
three
books
in
the
room--jeremy
taylorâ€™s
â€˜holy
living
and
dyingâ€™
a
volume
of
the
quiver
and
a
little
gilded
book
on
wildflowers
he
read
in
vain
he
lay
and
listened
to
the
uproar
of
his
thoughts
on
which
an
occasional
sound--the
droning
of
a
fly
the
cry
of
a
milkman
the
noise
of
a
passing
van--obtruded
from
the
workaday
world
the
pale
gold
sunlight
edged
softly
over
the
bed
he
ate
up
everything
on
his
tray
he
even
on
the
shoals
of
nightmare
dreamed
awhile
but
by
and
by
as
the
hours
wheeled
slowly
on
he
grew
less
calm
less
strenuously
resolved
on
lying
there
inactive
every
sparrow
that
twittered
cried
reveille
through
his
brain
he
longed
with
an
ardour
strange
to
his
temperament
to
be
up
and
doing
what
if
his
misfortune
was
as
he
had
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
suggested
to
sheila
only
a
morbid
delusion
of
mind
shared
too
in
part
by
sheer
force
of
his
absurd
confession
even
if
he
was
going
mad
who
knows
how
peaceful
a
release
that
might
not
be
could
his
shrewd
old
vicar
have
implicitly
believed
in
him
if
the
change
were
as
complete
as
he
supposed
it
he
flung
off
the
bedclothes
and
locked
the
door
he
dressed
himself
noticing
he
fancied
with
a
deadly
revulsion
of
feeling
that
his
coat
was
a
little
too
short
in
the
sleeves
his
waistcoat
too
loose
in
the
midst
of
his
dressing
came
sheila
bringing
his
luncheon
â€˜iâ€™m
sorryâ€™
he
called
out
stooping
quickly
beside
the
bed
â€˜i
canâ€™t
talk
now
please
put
the
tray
downâ€™
about
half
an
hour
afterwards
he
heard
the
outer
door
close
and
peeping
from
behind
the
curtains
saw
his
wife
go
out
all
was
drowsily
quiet
in
the
house
he
devoured
his
lunch
like
a
schoolboy
that
finished
to
the
last
crumb
without
a
momentâ€™s
delay
he
covered
his
face
with
a
towel
locked
the
door
behind
him
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
and
ran
lightly
downstairs
he
stuffed
the
towel
into
an
ulster
pocket
put
on
a
soft
wide-brimmed
hat
and
noiselessly
let
himself
out
then
he
turned
with
an
almost
hysterical
delight
and
ran--ran
like
the
wind
without
pausing
without
thinking
straight
on
up
one
turning
down
another
until
he
reached
a
broad
open
common
thickly
wooded
sprinkled
with
gorse
and
hazel
and
may
and
faintly
purple
with
fading
heather
there
he
flung
himself
down
in
the
beautiful
sunlight
among
the
yellowing
bracken
to
recover
his
breath
he
lay
there
for
many
minutes
thinking
almost
with
composure
flight
it
seemed
had
for
the
moment
quietened
the
demands
of
that
other
feebly
struggling
personality
which
was
beginning
to
insinuate
itself
into
his
consciousness
which
had
so
miraculously
broken
in
and
taken
possession
of
his
body
he
would
not
think
now
all
he
needed
was
a
little
quiet
and
patience
before
he
threw
off
for
good
and
all
his
right
to
be
free
to
be
his
own
master
to
call
himself
sane
he
scrambled
up
and
turned
his
face
towards
the
westering
sun
what
was
there
in
the
stillness
of
its
beautiful
splendour
that
seemed
to
sharpen
his
horror
and
difficulty
and
yet
to
stir
him
to
such
a
daring
and
devilry
as
he
had
never
known
since
he
was
a
boy
there
was
little
sound
of
life
somewhere
an
unknown
bird
was
singing
and
a
few
late
bees
were
droning
in
the
bracken
all
these
years
he
had
like
an
old
blind
horse
stolidly
plodded
round
and
round
in
a
dull
self-set
routine
and
now
just
when
the
spirit
had
come
for
rebellion
the
mood
for
a
harmless
truancy
there
had
fallen
with
them
too
this
hideous
enigma
he
sat
there
with
the
dusky
silhouette
of
the
face
that
was
now
drenched
with
sunlight
in
his
mindâ€™s
eye
he
set
off
again
up
the
stony
incline
why
not
walk
on
and
on
in
time
real
wholesome
weariness
would
come
he
could
sleep
at
ease
in
some
pleasant
wayside
inn
without
once
meeting
the
eyes
that
stood
as
it
were
like
a
window
between
himself
and
a
shrewd
incredulous
scoffing
world
that
would
turn
him
into
a
monstrosity
and
his
story
into
a
fable
and
in
a
little
while
perhaps
in
three
days
he
would
awaken
out
of
this
engrossing
nightmare
and
know
he
was
free
this
black
dog
gone
from
his
back
and
as
the
old
saying
expressed
it
without
any
one
dreaming
what
it
really
meant
his
own
man
again
how
astonished
sheila
would
be
how
warmly
she
would
welcome
him
oh
yes
of
course
she
would
he
came
again
to
a
standstill
no
voice
answered
him
out
of
that
illimitable
gold
and
blue
nothing
seemed
aware
of
him
but
as
he
stood
there
doubtful
as
cain
on
the
outskirts
of
the
unknown
he
caught
the
sound
of
a
footfall
on
the
lonely
and
stone-strewn
path
the
ground
sloped
steeply
away
to
the
left
and
slowly
mounting
the
hillside
came
mildly
on
an
old
lady
he
knew
a
miss
sinnet
an
old
friend
of
his
motherâ€™s
there
was
just
such
a
little
seat
as
that
other
he
knew
so
well
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
he
made
his
way
to
it
intending
to
sit
quietly
there
until
the
little
old
lady
had
passed
by
up
and
up
she
came
her
large
bonnet
appeared
and
then
her
mild
white
face
inclined
a
little
towards
him
as
she
ascended
evidently
this
very
seat
was
her
goal
and
evasion
was
impossible
evasion
memory
rushed
back
and
set
his
pulses
beating
he
turned
boldly
to
the
sun
and
the
old
lady
with
a
brief
glance
into
his
face
composed
herself
at
the
other
end
of
the
little
seat
she
gazed
out
of
a
gentle
reverie
into
the
golden
valley
and
so
they
sat
a
while
and
almost
as
if
she
had
felt
the
bond
of
acquaintance
between
them
she
presently
sighed
and
addressed
him
â€˜a
very
very
beautiful
view
sirâ€™
lawford
paused
then
turned
a
gloomy
earnest
face
gilded
with
sunshine
â€˜beautiful
indeedâ€™
he
said
â€˜but
not
for
me
no
miss
sinnet
not
for
meâ€™
the
old
lady
gravely
turned
and
examined
the
aquiline
profile
â€˜well
i
confessâ€™
she
remarked
urbanely
â€˜you
have
the
advantage
of
meâ€™
lawford
smiled
uneasily
â€˜believe
me
it
is
little
advantageâ€™
â€˜my
sightâ€™
said
miss
sinnet
precisely
â€˜is
not
so
good
as
i
might
wish
though
better
perhaps
than
i
might
have
hoped
i
fear
i
am
not
much
wiser
your
face
is
still
unfamiliar
to
meâ€™
â€˜it
is
not
unfamiliar
to
meâ€™
said
lawford
whose
trickery
was
this
he
thought
putting
such
affected
stuff
into
his
mouth
a
faint
lightening
of
pity
came
into
the
silvery
and
scrupulous
countenance
â€˜ah
dear
me
yesâ€™
she
said
courteously
lawford
rested
a
lean
hand
on
the
seat
â€˜and
have
youâ€™
he
asked
â€˜not
the
least
recollection
in
the
world
of
my
faceâ€™
â€˜now
reallyâ€™
she
said
smiling
blandly
â€˜is
that
quite
fair
think
of
all
the
scores
and
scores
of
faces
in
seventy
long
years
and
how
very
treacherous
memory
is
you
shall
do
me
the
service
of
reminding
me
of
one
whose
name
has
for
the
moment
escaped
meâ€™
â€˜i
am
the
son
of
a
very
old
friend
of
yours
miss
sinnetâ€™
said
lawford
quietly
â€˜a
friend
that
was
once
your
schoolfellow
at
brightonâ€™
â€˜well
nowâ€™
said
the
old
lady
grasping
her
umbrella
â€˜that
is
undoubtedly
a
clue
but
then
you
see
all
but
one
of
the
friends
of
my
girlhood
are
dead
and
if
i
have
never
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
her
son
unless
there
is
a
decided
resemblance
how
am
i
to
recollect
her
by
looking
at
himâ€™
â€˜there
is
i
believe
a
likenessâ€™
said
lawford
she
nodded
her
great
bonnet
at
him
with
gentle
amusement
â€˜you
are
insistent
in
your
fancy
well
let
me
think
again
the
last
to
leave
me
was
fanny
urquhart
that
was--let
me
see--last
october
now
you
are
certainly
not
fanny
urquhartâ€™s
sonâ€™
she
stooped
austerely
â€˜for
she
never
had
one
last
year
too
i
heard
that
my
dear
dear
mrs
jameson
was
dead
her
i
hadnâ€™t
met
for
many
many
years
but
if
i
may
venture
to
say
so
yours
is
not
a
scottish
face
and
she
not
only
married
a
scottish
husband
but
was
herself
a
dunbar
no
i
am
still
at
a
lossâ€™
a
miserable
strife
was
in
her
chance
companionâ€™s
mind
a
strife
of
anger
and
recrimination
he
turned
his
eyes
wearily
to
the
fast
declining
sun
â€˜you
will
forgive
my
persistency
but
i
assure
you
it
is
a
matter
of
life
or
death
to
me
is
there
no
one
my
face
recalls
my
voiceâ€™
miss
sinnet
drew
her
long
lips
together
her
eyebrows
lifted
with
the
faintest
perturbation
â€˜but
he
certainly
knows
my
nameâ€™
she
said
to
herself
she
turned
once
more
and
in
the
still
autumnal
beauty
beneath
that
pale
blue
arch
of
evening
these
two
human
beings
confronted
one
another
again
she
eyed
him
blandly
yet
with
a
certain
grave
directness
â€˜i
donâ€™t
really
thinkâ€™
she
said
â€˜you
can
be
mary
lawfordâ€™s
son
i
could
scarcely
have
mistaken
himâ€™
lawford
gulped
and
turned
away
he
hardly
knew
what
this
surge
of
feeling
meant
was
it
hope
despair
resentment
had
he
caught
even
the
echo
of
an
unholy
joy
his
mind
for
a
moment
became
confused
as
if
in
the
tumult
of
a
struggle
he
heard
himself
expostulate
â€˜ah
miss
bennett
i
fear
i
set
you
too
difficult
a
taskâ€™
the
old
lady
drew
abruptly
in
like
a
trustful
and
gentle
snail
into
its
shocked
house
â€˜bennett
sir
but
my
name
is
not
bennettâ€™
and
again
lawford
accepted
the
miserable
prompting
â€˜not
bennett
how
can
i
ever
then
apologise
for
so
frantic
a
mistakeâ€™
the
little
old
lady
took
firm
hold
of
her
umbrella
she
did
not
answer
him
â€˜the
likeness
the
likenessâ€™
he
began
unctuously
and
stopped
for
the
glance
that
dwelt
fleetingly
on
him
was
cold
with
the
formidable
dignity
and
displeasure
of
age
he
raised
his
hat
and
turned
miserably
home
he
strode
on
out
of
the
last
gold
into
the
blue
twilight
what
fantastic
foolery
of
mind
was
mastering
him
he
cast
a
hurried
look
over
his
shoulder
at
the
kindly
and
offended
old
figure
sitting
there
solitary
on
the
little
seat
in
her
great
bonnet
with
back
turned
resolutely
upon
him--the
friend
of
his
dead
mother
who
might
have
proved
in
his
need
a
friend
indeed
to
him
and
he
had
by
this
insane
caprice
hopelessly
estranged
her
she
would
remember
this
face
well
enough
now
he
thought
bitterly
and
would
take
her
place
among
his
quiet
enemies
if
ever
the
day
of
reckoning
should
come
it
was
scandalous
it
was
banal
to
have
abused
her
trust
and
courtesy
oh
it
was
hopeless
to
struggle
any
more
the
fates
were
against
him
they
had
played
him
a
trick
he
was
to
be
their
transitory
sport
as
many
a
better
man
he
could
himself
recollect
had
been
before
him
he
would
go
home
and
give
in
let
sheila
do
with
him
what
she
pleased
no
one
but
a
lunatic
could
have
acted
as
he
had
with
just
that
frantic
hint
of
method
so
remarkable
in
the
insane
he
left
the
common
a
lamplighter
was
lighting
the
lamps
a
thin
evening
haze
was
on
the
air
if
only
he
had
stayed
at
home
that
fateful
afternoon
who
what
had
induced
him
enticed
him
to
venture
out
and
even
with
the
thought
welled
up
into
his
mind
an
intense
desire
to
go
to
the
old
green
time-worn
churchyard
again
to
sit
there
contentedly
alone
where
none
heeded
the
completest
metamorphosis
down
beside
the
yew-trees
what
a
fool
he
had
been
there
alone
of
course
lay
his
only
possible
chance
of
recovery
he
would
go
to-morrow
perhaps
sheila
had
not
yet
discovered
his
absence
and
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
repeating
so
successful
a
stratagem
remembrance
of
his
miserable
mistake
of
miss
sinnet
faintly
returned
to
him
as
he
swiftly
mounted
the
steps
to
his
porch
poor
old
lady
he
would
make
amends
for
his
discourtesy
when
he
was
quite
himself
again
she
should
some
day
hear
perhaps
his
infinitely
tragic
infinitely
comic
experience
from
his
own
lips
he
would
take
her
some
flowers
some
old
keepsake
of
his
motherâ€™s
what
would
he
not
do
when
the
old
moods
and
brains
of
the
stupid
arthur
lawford
whom
he
had
appreciated
so
little
and
so
superficially
came
back
to
him
he
ran
up
the
steps
and
stopped
dead
his
hand
in
his
pocket
chilled
and
aghast
sheila
had
taken
his
keys
he
stood
there
dazed
and
still
beneath
the
dim
yellow
of
his
own
fanlight
and
once
again
that
inward
spring
flew
back
â€˜brazen
it
out
brazen
it
out
knock
and
ringâ€™
he
knocked
flamboyantly
and
rang
there
came
a
quiet
step
and
the
door
opened
â€˜dr
simon
of
course
has
calledâ€™
he
inquired
suavely
â€˜yes
sirâ€™
â€˜ah
and
goneâ€™--as
i
feared
and
mrs
lawfordâ€™
â€˜i
think
mrs
lawford
is
in
sirâ€™
lawford
put
out
a
detaining
hand
â€˜we
will
not
disturb
her
we
will
not
disturb
her
i
can
find
my
way
up
oh
yes
thank
youâ€™
but
ada
still
palely
barred
the
way
â€˜i
think
sirâ€™
she
said
â€˜mrs
lawford
would
prefer
to
see
you
herself
she
told
me
most
particularly
â€œall
callersâ€
and
mr
lawford
was
not
to
be
disturbed
on
any
accountâ€™
â€˜disturbed
god
forbidâ€™
said
lawford
but
his
dark
eyes
failed
to
move
these
lightest
hazel
â€˜wellâ€™
he
continued
nonchalantly
â€˜perhaps--perhaps
it--would
be
as
well
if
mrs
lawford
should
know
that
i
am
here
no
thank
you
i
wonâ€™t
come
in
please
go
and
tell--â€™
but
even
as
the
maid
turned
to
obey
sheila
herself
appeared
at
the
dining-room
door
in
hat
and
veil
lawford
hesitated
an
immeasurable
moment
in
one
swift
glance
he
perceived
the
lamplit
mystery
of
evening
beckoning
calling
pleading--fly
fly
homeâ€™s
here
for
you
begin
again
begin
again
and
there
before
him
in
quiet
and
hostile
decorum
stood
maid
and
mistress
he
took
off
his
hat
and
stepped
quickly
in
â€˜so
late
so
very
late
i
fearâ€™
he
began
glibly
â€˜a
sudden
call
a
perfectly
impossible
distance
shall
we
disturb
him
do
you
thinkâ€™
â€˜wouldnâ€™t
itâ€™
began
sheila
softly
â€˜be
rather
a
pity
perhaps
dr
simon
seemed
to
think
but
of
course
you
must
decide
thatâ€™
ada
turned
quiet
small
eyes
â€˜no
no
by
no
meansâ€™
he
almost
mumbled
and
a
hard
slow
smile
passed
over
sheilaâ€™s
face
â€˜excuse
me
one
momentâ€™
she
said
â€˜i
will
see
if
he
is
awakeâ€™
she
swept
swiftly
forward
superb
and
triumphant
beneath
the
gaze
of
those
dark
restless
eyes
but
so
still
was
home
and
street
that
quite
distinctly
a
clear
and
youthful
laughter
was
heard
and
light
footsteps
approaching
sheila
paused
ada
in
the
act
of
closing
the
door
peered
out
â€˜miss
alice
maâ€™amâ€™
she
said
and
in
this
infinitesimal
advantage
of
time
dr
ferguson
had
seized
his
vanishing
opportunity
and
was
already
swiftly
mounting
the
stairs
mrs
lawford
stood
with
veil
half
raised
and
coldly
smiling
lips
and
as
if
it
were
by
pre-arrangement
her
daughterâ€™s
laughing
greeting
from
the
garden
and
from
the
landing
above
her
a
faint
â€˜ah
and
how
are
we
nowâ€™
broke
out
simultaneously
and
ada
silent
and
discreet
had
thrown
open
the
door
again
to
the
twilight
and
to
the
young
people
ascending
the
steps
lawford
was
still
sitting
on
his
bed
before
a
cold
and
ashy
hearth
when
sheila
knocked
at
the
door
â€˜yesâ€™
he
said
â€˜whoâ€™s
thereâ€™
no
answer
followed
he
rose
with
a
shuddering
sigh
and
turned
the
key
his
wife
entered
â€˜that
little
exhibition
of
finesse
was
part
of
our
agreement
i
supposeâ€™
â€˜i
say--â€™
began
lawford
â€˜to
creep
out
in
my
absence
like
a
thief
and
to
return
like
a
mountebank
that
was
part
of
our
compactâ€™
â€˜i
sayâ€™
he
stubbornly
began
again
â€˜did
you
wire
for
aliceâ€™
â€˜will
you
please
answer
my
question
am
i
to
be
a
mere
catspaw
in
your
intrigues
in
this
miserable
masquerade
before
the
servants
to
set
the
whole
place
ringing
with
the
name
of
a
doctor
that
doesnâ€™t
exist
and
a
bedridden
patient
that
slips
out
of
the
house
with
his
bedroom
key
in
his
pocket
are
you
aware
that
ada
has
been
hammering
at
your
door
every
half-hour
of
your
absence
are
you
aware
of
that
how
muchâ€™
she
continued
in
a
low
bitter
voice
â€˜how
much
should
i
offer
for
her
discretionâ€™
â€˜who
was
that
with
aliceâ€™
inquired
the
same
toneless
voice
â€˜i
refuse
to
be
ignored
i
refuse
to
be
made
a
child
of
will
you
please
answer
meâ€™
lawford
turned
â€˜look
here
sheilaâ€™
he
began
heavily
â€˜what
about
alice
if
you
wired
well
itâ€™s
useless
to
say
anything
more
but
if
you
didnâ€™t
i
ask
you
just
this
one
thing
donâ€™t
tell
herâ€™
â€˜oh
i
perfectly
appreciate
a
fatherâ€™s
natural
anxietyâ€™
her
husband
drew
up
his
shoulders
as
if
to
receive
a
blow
â€˜yes
yesâ€™
he
said
â€˜but
you
wonâ€™tâ€™
the
sound
of
a
young
laughing
voice
came
faintly
up
from
below
â€˜how
did
jimmie
fortescue
know
she
was
coming
home
to-dayâ€™
â€˜will
you
not
inquire
of
jimmie
fortescue
for
yourselfâ€™
â€˜oh
what
is
the
use
of
sneeringâ€™
began
the
dull
voice
again
â€˜i
am
horribly
tired
sheila
and
try
how
you
will
you
canâ€™t
convince
me
that
you
believe
for
a
moment
that
i
am
not
myself
that
you
are
as
hard
as
you
pretend
an
acquaintance
even
a
friend
might
be
deceived
but
husband
and
wife--oh
no
it
isnâ€™t
only
a
manâ€™s
face
thatâ€™s
himself--or
even
his
handsâ€™
he
looked
at
them
straightened
them
slowly
out
and
buried
them
in
his
pockets
â€˜all
i
care
about
now
is
alice
is
she
or
is
she
not
going
to
be
told

am
simply
asking

just
a
chanceâ€™
â€˜â€œsimply
asking
me
to
give
alice
a

now
isnâ€™t
that
really
just
a
littleâ€™
lawford
slowly
shook
his
head
â€˜you
know
in
your
heart
it
isnâ€™t

you
understand
me
quite
well
although
you
persistently
pretend
not

argue
now
i
canâ€™t

up

am
just
about
as
far
down
as
i
can
go
itâ€™s
only
aliceâ€™
â€˜i
see
a
lucid
intervalâ€™
suggested
his
wife
in
a
low
trembling
voice
â€˜yes
yes
if
you
likeâ€™
said
her
husband
patiently
â€˜â€œa
lucid
intervalâ€
donâ€™t
please
look
at
my
face
like
that
sheila
think--think
that
itâ€™s
just
lupus
just
some
horrible
disfigurementâ€™
not
much
light
was
in
the
large
room
and
there
was
something
so
extraordinarily
characteristic
of
her
husband
in
those
stooping
shoulders
in
the
head
hung
a
little
forward
and
in
the
preternaturally
solemn
voice
that
sheila
had
to
bend
a
little
over
the
bed
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
sallow
and
keener
face
again
she
sighed
and
even
on
her
own
strained
ear
her
sigh
sounded
almost
like
one
of
relief
â€˜itâ€™s
useless
i
know
to
ask
you
anything
while
you
are
in
this
moodâ€™
continued
lawford
dully
â€˜i
know
that
of
oldâ€™
the
white
ringed
hands
clenched
â€˜â€œof
oldâ€â€™
â€˜i
didnâ€™t
mean
anything
donâ€™t
listen
to
what
i

just
alice

all
i
mean
at
onceâ€™
â€˜donâ€™t
for

not
perfectly
aware
that
it
is
only

think
of

particularly
anxious
about
my
feelings
werenâ€™t
you
you
broke
the
news
to
me
with
the
tenderest
solicitude
i
am
glad
our--our
daughter
shares
my
husbandâ€™s
loveâ€™
â€˜look
hereâ€™
said
lawford
densely
â€˜you
know
that
i
love
you
as
much
as
ever
but
with
this--as
i
am
what
would
be
the
good
of
my
saying
soâ€™
mrs
lawford
took
a
deep
breath
and
a
voice
called
softly
at
the
door
â€˜mother
are
you
there
is
father
awake
may
i
come
inâ€™
in
a
flash
the
memory
returned
to
her
twenty-four
hours
ago
she
was
asking
that
very
question
of
this
unspeakable
figure
that
sat
hunched-up
before
her
â€˜one
moment
dearâ€™
she
called
and
added
in
a
very
low
voice
â€˜come
hereâ€™
lawford
looked
up
â€˜whatâ€™
he
said
â€˜perhaps
perhapsâ€™
she
whispered
â€˜it
isnâ€™t
quite
so
badâ€™
â€˜for
mercyâ€™s
sake
sheilaâ€™
he
said
â€˜donâ€™t
torture
me
tell
the
poor
child
to
go
awayâ€™
she
paused
â€˜are
you
there
alice
would
you
mind
father
says
waiting
a
little
he
is
so
very
tiredâ€™
â€˜too
tired
to
oh
very
well
motherâ€™
mrs
lawford
opened
the
door
and
called
after
her
â€˜is
jimmie
goneâ€™
â€˜oh
yes
hoursâ€™
â€˜where
did
you
meetâ€™
â€˜i
couldnâ€™t
get
a
carriage
at

station
he
carried
my
dressing-bag
i
begged
him
not
to
the
otherâ€™s
coming
on
you
know
what
jimmie
is
how
very
very
lucky
i
did
come
home
i
donâ€™t
know
what
made
me
just
an
impulse
they
did
laugh
at
me
so
father
dear--do
speak
to
me
how
are
you
nowâ€™
lawford
opened
his
mouth
gulped
and
shook
his
head
â€˜ssh
dearâ€™
whispered
sheila
â€˜i
think
he
has
fallen
asleep
i
will
be
down
in
a
minuteâ€™
mrs
lawford
was
about
to
close
the
door
when
ada
appeared
â€˜if
you
please
maâ€™amâ€™
she
said
â€˜i
have
been
waiting
as
you
told
me
to
let
dr
ferguson
out
but
itâ€™s
nearly
seven
now
and
the
tableâ€™s
not
laid
yetâ€™
â€˜i
really
should
have
thought
adaâ€™
sheila
began
then
caught
back
the
angry
words
and
turned
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
into
the
room
â€˜do
you
think
you
will
need
anything
more
dr
fergusonâ€™
she
asked
in
a
sepulchral
voice
again
lawfordâ€™s
lips
moved
again
he
shook
his
head
â€˜one
moment
adaâ€™
she
said
closing
the
door
â€˜some
more
medicine--what
medicine
quick
she
mustnâ€™t
suspectâ€™
â€˜â€œwhat
medicineâ€â€™
repeated
lawford
stolidly
â€˜oh
vexing
vexing
donâ€™t
you
see
we
must
send
her
out
donâ€™t
you
see
what
was
it
you
sent
to
critchettâ€™s
for
last
night
tell
him
thatâ€™s
gone
we
want
more
of
thatâ€™
lawford
stared
heavily
oh
yes
yesâ€™
he
said
thickly
â€˜more
of
thatâ€™
sheila
with
a
shrug
of
extreme
distaste
and
vexation
hastily
opened
the
door
â€˜dr
ferguson
wants
a
further
supply
of
the
drug
which
mr
critchett
made
up
for
mr
lawford
yesterday
evening

had
better
go
at
once
ada
and
please
make
as
much
haste
as
you
possibly
canâ€™
â€˜i
say
i
sayâ€™
began
lawford
but
it
was
too
late
the
door
was
shut
â€˜how
i
detest
this
wretched
falsehood
and
subterfuge
what
could
have
induced
youâ€™
â€˜yesâ€™
said
her
husband
â€˜what
i
think
iâ€™ll
be
getting
to
bed
again
sheila
i
forgot
i
had
been
ill
and
now
i
do
really
feel
very
tired
but
i
should
like
to
feel--in
spite
of
this
hideous--i
should
like
to
feel
we
are
friends
sheilaâ€™
sheila
almost
imperceptibly
shuddered
crossed
the
room
and
faced
the
still
almost
lifeless
mask
â€˜i
spokeâ€™
she
said
in
a
low
cold
difficult
voice--â€˜i
spoke
in
a
temper
this
morning
you
must
try
to
understand
what
a
shock
it
has
been
to
me
now
i
own
it
frankly
i
know
you
are--arthur
but
god
only
knows
how
it
frightens
me
and--and--horrifies
meâ€™
she
shut
her
eyes
beneath
her
veil
they
waited
on
in
silence
a
while
â€˜poor
boyâ€™
she
said
at
last
lightly
touching
the
loose
sleeve
â€˜be
brave
it
will
all
come
right
soon
meanwhile
for
aliceâ€™s
sake
if
not
for
mine
donâ€™t
give
way
to--to
caprices
and
all
that
keep
quietly
here
arthur

forgive
my
impatienceâ€™
he
put
out
his
hand
as
if
to
touch
her
â€˜forgive
youâ€™
he
said
humbly
pushing
it
stubbornly
back
into
his
pocket
again
â€˜oh
sheila
the
forgiveness
is
all
on
your
side
you
know
i
have
nothing
to
forgiveâ€™
a
long
silence
fell
between
them
â€˜then
to-nightâ€™
at
last
began
sheila
wearily
drawing
back
â€˜we
say
nothing
to
alice
except
that
you
are
too
tired--just
nervous
prostration--to
see
her
what
we
should
do
without
this
influenza
i
cannot
conceive
mr
bethany
will
probably
look
in
on
his
way
home
and
then
we
can
talk
it
over--we
can
talk
it
over
again
so
long
as
you
are
like
this
yourself
in
mind
why
i--what
is
it
nowâ€™
she
broke
off
querulously
â€˜if
you
please
maâ€™am
mr
critchett
says
he
doesnâ€™t
know
dr
ferguson
his
nameâ€™s
not
in
the
directory
and
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
the
message
and
heâ€™s
sorry
but
he
must
have
it
in
writing
because
there
was
more
even
in
the
first
packet
than
he
ought
by
rights
to
send
what
shall
i
do
if
you
pleaseâ€™
still
looking
at
her
husband
sheila
listened
quietly
to
the
end
and
then
as
if
in
inarticulate
disdain
she
deliberately
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
went
out
to
play
her
part
unaided
her
husband
turned
wearily
once
more
and
drawing
up
a
chair
sat
down
in
front
of
the
cold
grate
he
realised
that
sheila
thought
him
as
much
of
a
fool
now
as
she
had
for
the
moment
thought
him
an
impostor
or
something
worse
the
night
before
that
was
at
least
something
gained
he
realised
too
in
a
vague
way
that
the
exuberance
of
mind
that
had
practically
invented
dr
ferguson
and
outraged
miss
sinnet
had
quite
suddenly
flickered
out
it
was
astonishing
he
thought
with
gaze
fixed
innocently
on
the
black
coals
that
he
should
ever
have
done
such
things
he
detested
that
kind
of
â€˜rotâ€™
that
jaunty
theatrical
pose
so
many
men
prided
their
jackdaw
brains
on
and
he
sat
quite
still
like
a
cat
at
a
cranny
listening
as
it
were
for
the
faintest
remotest
stir
that
might
hint
at
any
return
of
this--activity
it
was
the
first
really
sane
moment
he
had
had
since
the
â€˜changeâ€™
whatever
it
was
that
had
happened
at
widderstone
was
now
distinctly
weakening
in
effect
why
now
perhaps
he
stole
a
thievish
look
over
his
shoulder
at
the
glass
and
cautiously
drew
finger
and
thumb
down
that
beaked
nose
then
he
really
quietly
smiled
a
smile
he
felt
this
abominable
facial
caricature
was
quite
unused
to
the
superior
lawford
smile
of
guileless
contempt
for
the
fanatical
the
fantastic
and
the
bizarre
he
wouldnâ€™t
have
sat
with
his
feet
on
the
fender
before
a
burnt-out
fire
and
the
animosity
of
that
â€˜heâ€™
uttered
only
just
under
his
breath
surprised
even
himself
it
actually
did
seem
as
if
there
were
a
chance
if
only
he
kept
cool
and
collected
if
the
whole
mind
of
a
man
was
bent
on
being
one
thing
surely
no
power
on
earth
certainly
not
on
earth
could
for
long
compel
him
to
look
another
any
more
followed
the
resplendent
thought
than
vice
versa
that
in
fact
was
the
trick
that
had
been
in
fitful
fashion
played
him
since
yesterday
obviously
and
apart
altogether
from
his
promise
to
sheila
the
best
possible
thing
he
could
do
would
be
to
walk
quietly
over
to
widderstone
to-morrow
and
like
a
child
that
has
lost
a
penny
just
make
the
attempt
to
reverse
the
process
look
at
the
graves
read
the
inscriptions
on
the
weather-beaten
stones
compose
himself
once
more
to
sleep
on
the
little
seat
magic
witchcraft
possession
and
all
that--well
mr
bethany
might
prefer
to
take
it
on
the
authority
of
the
bible
if
it
was
his
duty
but
it
was
at
least
mainly
old
testament
stuff
like
polygamy
joshua
and
the
â€˜unclean
beastsâ€™
the
â€˜unclean
beastsâ€™
it
was
simply
as
simon
had
said
mainly
an
affair
of
the
nerves
like
indian
jugglery
he
had
heard
of
dozens
of
such
cases
or
similar
cases
and
it
was
hardly
likely
that
cases
even
remotely
like
his
own
would
be
much
bragged
about
or
advertised
all
those
mysterious
â€˜disappearancesâ€™
too
which
one
reads
about
so
repeatedly
what
of
them
even
now
he
felt
and
glanced
swiftly
behind
him
at
the
fancy
it
would
be
better
to
think
as
softly
as
possible
not
to
hope
too
openly
certainly
not
to
triumph
in
the
least
degree
just
in
case
of--well--listeners
he
would
wrap
up
too
and
he
wouldnâ€™t
tell
sheila
of
the
project
till
he
had
come
safely
back
what
an
excellent
joke
it
would
be
to
confess
meekly
to
his
escapade
and
to
be
scolded
and
then
suddenly
to
reveal
himself
he
sat
back
and
gazed
with
an
almost
malignant
animosity
at
the
face
in
the
portrait
comely
and
plump
an
inarticulate
unfathomable
depression
rolled
back
on
him
like
a
mist
out
of
the
sea
he
hastily
undressed
put
watch
and
door-key
and
critchettâ€™s
powder
under
his
pillow
paused
vacantly
ruminated
and
then
replaced
the
powder
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
said
his
prayers
and
got
shivering
to
bed
he
did
not
feel
hurt
at
sheilaâ€™s
leaving
him
like
this
so
long
as
she
really
believed
in
him
and
now--alice
was
home
he
listened
trying
not
to
shiver
for
her
voice
and
sometimes
heard
he
fancied
the
clear
note
it
was
this
beastly
influenza
that
made
him
feel
so
cold
and
lifeless
but
all
would
soon
come
right--that
is
if
only
that
face
luminous
against
the
floating
darkness
within
would
not
appear
the
instant
he
closed
his
eyes
but
legions
of
dreams
are
influenzaâ€™s
allies
he
fell
into
a
chill
doze
heard
voices
innumerable
and
one
above
the
rest
shouting
them
down
until
there
fell
a
lull
and
another
as
it
were
from
afar
said
quite
clearly
and
distinctly
â€˜but
surely
my
dear
you
have
heard
the
story
of
the
poor
old
charwoman
who
talked
greek
in
her
delirium
a
little
school
french
need
not
alarm
usâ€™
and
lawford
opened
his
eyes
again
on
mr
bethany
standing
at
his
bed
â€˜tt
tt
there
iâ€™ve
been
and
waked
him
and
yet
they
say
men
make
such
excellent
nurses
in
time
of
war
but
you
see
lawford
what
did
i
tell
you
wasnâ€™t
i
now
an
infallible
prophet
your
wife
has
been
giving
me
a
most
glowing
account
quite
your
old
self
she
tells
me
except
for
just
this--this
touch
of
facial
paralysis
and
i
think
do
you
knowâ€™
the
kind
old
creature
stooped
over
the
bed
but
still
lawford
noticed
bitterly
still
without
his
spectacles--â€˜yes
i
really
think
there
is
a
decided
improvement
not
quite
so--drawn
we
must
make
haste
slowly
wedderburn
you
know
believes
profoundly
in
simon
he
pulled
his
wife
through
a
dangerous
confinement
and
hereâ€™s
pills
and
tonics
and
liniments--a
whole
chemistâ€™s
shop
oh
we
are
getting
on
swimminglyâ€™
flamelight
was
flickering
in
the
candled
dusk
lawford
turned
his
head
and
saw
sheilaâ€™s
coiled
beautiful
hair
in
the
firelight
â€˜you
havenâ€™t
told
aliceâ€™
he
asked
â€˜my
dear
good
manâ€™
said
mr
bethany
â€˜of
course
we
havenâ€™t
you
shall
tell
her
yourself
on
monday
what
an
incredible
tradition
it
will
be
but
you
mustnâ€™t
worry
you
mustnâ€™t
even
think
and
no
more
of
these
jaunts
eh
that
ferguson
business--that
was
too
bad
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
the
fellow
now
we
have
created
him
he
will
come
home
to
roost--mark
my
words
and
as
likely
as
not
down
the
vicarage
chimney
i
wouldnâ€™t
have
believed
it
of
you
my
dear
fellowâ€™
he
beamed
but
looked
none
the
less
very
lean
and
fagged
and
depressed
â€˜how
did
the
wedding
go
offâ€™
lawford
managed
to
think
of
inquiring
â€˜oh
a1â€™
said
mr
bethany
â€˜iâ€™ve
just
been
describing
it
to
alice--the
bride
her
bridegroom
mother
aunts
cake
presents
finery
blushes
tears
and
everything
that
was
hers
weâ€™ve
been
in
fits
havenâ€™t
we
mrs
lawford
and
alice
says
iâ€™m
a
worth
in
a
clerical
collar--didnâ€™t
she
and
that
itâ€™s
only
art
that
has
kept
me
out
of
an
apron
now
look
here
quiet
quiet
quiet
no
excitement
no
pranks
what
is
there
to
worry
about
pray
and
now
little
dorritâ€™s
down
with
influenza
too
and
craik
and
i
will
have
double
work
to
do
well
well
good-bye
my
dear
god
bless
you
lawford
i
canâ€™t
tell
you
how
relieved
how
unspeakably
relieved
i
am
to
find
you
so
much--so
much
better
feed
him
up
my
other
dear
body
and
mind
and
soul
and
spirit
and
there
goes
the
bell
i
must
have
a
biscuit
iâ€™ve
swallowed
nothing
but
a
cupid
in
plaster
of
paris
since
breakfast
goodnight
we
shall
miss
you
both--bothâ€™
but
when
sheila
returned
her
husband
was
sunk
again
into
a
quiet
sleep
from
which
not
even
the
many
questions
she
fretted
to
put
to
him
seemed
weighty
enough
to
warrant
his
disturbance
so
when
lawford
again
opened
his
eyes
he
found
himself
lying
wide
awake
clear
and
refreshed
and
eager
to
get
up
but
upon
the
air
lay
the
still
hush
of
early
morning
he
tried
in
vain
to
catch
back
sleep
again
a
distant
shred
of
dream
still
floated
in
his
mind
like
a
cloud
at
evening
he
rarely
dreamed
but
certainly
something
immensely
interesting
had
but
a
moment
ago
eluded
him
he
sat
up
and
looked
at
the
clear
red
cinders
and
their
maze
of
grottoes
he
got
out
of
bed
and
peeped
through
the
blinds
to
the
east
and
opposite
to
him
gardens
and
an
apple-orchard
lay
and
there
in
strange
liquid
tranquillity
hung
the
morning
star
and
rose
rifling
into
the
dusk
of
night
the
first
grey
of
dawn
the
street
beneath
its
autumn
leaves
was
vacant
charmed
deserted
hardly
since
childhood
had
lawford
seen
the
dawn
unless
over
his
winter
breakfast-table
very
much
like
a
child
now
he
stood
gazing
out
of
his
bow-window--the
child
whom
timeâ€™s
busy
robins
had
long
ago
covered
over
with
the
leaves
of
numberless
hours
a
vague
exultation
fumed
up
into
his
brain
still
on
the
borders
of
sleep
he
unlocked
the
great
wardrobe
and
took
out
an
old
faded
purple
and
crimson
dressing-gown
that
had
belonged
to
his
grandfather
the
chief
glory
of
every
christmas
charade
he
pulled
the
cowl-like
hood
over
his
head
and
strode
majestically
over
to
the
looking-glass
he
looked
in
there
a
moment
on
the
strange
face
like
a
child
dismayed
at
its
own
excitement
and
a
fit
of
sobbing
that
was
half
uncontrollable
laughter
swept
over
him
he
threw
off
the
hood
and
turned
once
more
to
the
window
consciousness
had
flooded
back
indeed
what
would
sheila
have
said
to
see
him
there
the
unearthly
beauty
and
stillness
and
manâ€™s
small
labours
garden
and
wall
and
roof-tree
idle
and
smokeless
in
the
light
of
daybreak--there
seemed
to
be
some
half-told
secret
between
them
what
had
life
done
with
him
to
leave
a
reality
so
clouded
he
put
on
his
slippers
and
gently
opening
the
door
crept
with
extreme
caution
up
the
stairs
at
a
long
narrow
landing
window
he
confronted
a
panorama
of
starry
night-gardens
sloping
orchards
and
beyond
them
fields
hills
orion
the
dogs
in
the
clear
and
cloudless
darkness
â€˜my
god
how
beautifulâ€™
a
voice
whispered
and
a
cock
crowed
mistily
afar
he
stood
staring
like
a
child
into
the
wintry
brightness
of
a
pastry-cookâ€™s
then
once
more
he
crept
stealthily
on
he
stooped
and
listened
at
a
closed
door
until
he
fancied
that
above
the
beating
of
his
own
heart
he
could
hear
the
breathing
of
the
sleeper
within
then
taking
firm
hold
of
the
handle
with
both
hands
he
slowly
noiselessly
turned
it
and
peeped
in
on
alice
the
moon
was
long
past
her
faint
shining
here
the
blind
was
down
and
yet
it
was
not
pitch
dark
he
stood
with
eyes
fixed
waiting
then
he
edged
softly
forward
and
knelt
down
beside
the
bed
he
could
hear
her
breathing
now
long
low
quiet
unhastening--the
miracle
of
life
he
could
just
dimly
discern
the
darkness
of
her
hair
against
the
pillow
some
long-sealed
spring
of
tenderness
seemed
to
rise
in
his
heart
with
a
grief
and
an
ache
he
had
never
known
before
here
at
least
he
could
find
a
little
peace
a
brief
pause
however
futile
and
stupid
all
his
hopes
of
the
night
had
been
he
leant
his
head
on
his
hands
on
the
counterpane
and
refused
to
think
he
felt
a
quick
tremor
a
startled
movement
and
knew
that
eyes
wide
open
with
fear
were
striving
to
pierce
the
gloom
between
them
â€˜there
there
dearestâ€™
he
said
in
a
low
whisper
â€˜itâ€™s
only
me
only
meâ€™
he
stroked
the
narrow
hand
and
gazed
into
the
shadowiness
her
fingers
lay
quiet
and
passive
in
his
with
that
strange
sense
of
immateriality
that
sleep
brings
to
the
body
â€˜you
youâ€™
she
answered
with
a
deep
sigh
â€˜oh
dearest
how
you
frightened
me
what
is
wrong
why
have
you
come
are
you
worse
dearest
dearestâ€™
he
kissed
her
hand
â€˜no
alice
not
worse
i
couldnâ€™t
sleep
that
was
allâ€™
â€˜oh
and
i
came
so
utterly
miserable
to
bed
because
you
would
not
see
me
and
mother
would
tell
me
only
so
very
little
i
didnâ€™t
even
know
you
had
been
illâ€™
she
pressed
his
hand
between
her
own
â€˜but
this
you
know
is
very
very
naughty--you
will
catch
cold
you
bad
thing
what
would
mother
sayâ€™
â€˜i
think
we
mustnâ€™t
tell
her
dear
i
couldnâ€™t
help
it
i
felt
much
i
wanted
to
see
you
i
have
been
rather
miserableâ€™
â€˜whyâ€™
she
said
stroking
his
hand
from
wrist
to
fingertips
with
one
soft
finger
â€˜you
mustnâ€™t
be
miserable
you
and
me
have
never
done
such
a
thing
before
have
we
was
it
that
wretched
old
fluâ€™
it
was
too
dark
in
the
little
fragrant
room
even
to
see
her
face
so
close
to
his
own
and
yet
he
feared
â€˜dr
simonâ€™
she
went
on
softly
â€˜said
it
was
but
isnâ€™t
your
voice
a
little
hoarse
and
it
sounds
so
melancholy
in
the
dark
and
ohâ€™--she
squeezed
his
wrist--â€˜you
have
grown
so
thin
you
do
frighten
me
whatever
should
i
do
if
you
were
really
ill
and
it
was
so
odd
dear
when
first
i
woke
i
seemed
to
be
still
straining
my
eyes
in
a
dream
at
such
a
curious
haunting
face--not
very
nice
i
am
glad
i
am
glad
you
were
hereâ€™
â€˜what
was
the
dream-face
likeâ€™
came
the
muttered
question
â€˜dark
and
sharp
and
rather
dwelling
eyes
you
know
those
long
faces
one
sees
in
dreams
like
a
hawk
like
a
conjurorâ€™sâ€™
like
a
conjurorâ€™s--it
was
the
first
unguarded
and
ungarbled
criticism
â€˜perhaps
dear
if
you
find
my
voice
different
and
my
hand
shrunk
up
you
will
find
my
face
changed
too--like
a
conjurorâ€™s
what
thenâ€™
she
laughed
gaily
and
tenderly
â€˜you
silly
silly
i
should
love
you
more
than
ever
your
hands
are
icy
cold
i
canâ€™t
warm
them
nohowâ€™
lawford
held
tight
his
daughterâ€™s
hand
â€˜you
do
love
me
alice
you
would
not
turn
against
me
whatever
happened
ah
you
shall
see
you
shall
seeâ€™
a
sudden
burning
hope
sprang
up
in
him
surely
when
all
was
well
again
these
last
few
hours
would
not
have
been
spent
in
vain
like
the
shadow
of
death
they
had
been
against
whose
darkness
the
green
familiar
earth
seems
beautiful
as
the
plains
of
paradise
had
he
but
realized
before
how
much
he
loved
her--what
years
of
life
had
been
wasted
in
leaving
it
all
unsaid
he
came
back
from
his
reverie
to
find
his
hand
wet
with
her
tears
he
stroked
her
hair
and
touched
gently
her
eyelids
without
speaking
â€˜you
will
let
me
come
in
to-morrowâ€™
she
pleaded
â€˜you
wonâ€™t
keep
me
outâ€™
â€˜ah
but
dear
you
must
remember
your
mother
she
gets
so
anxious
and
every
word
the
doctor
says
is
law
how
would
you
like
me
to
come
again
like
this
perhaps--like
santa
clausâ€™
â€˜you
know
how
i
love
having
youâ€™
she
said
and
stopped
â€˜but--butâ€™
he
leaned
closer
â€˜yes
yes
comeâ€™
she
said
clutching
his
hand
and
hiding
her
eyes
â€˜it
is
only
my
dream--that
horrible
dwelling
face
in
the
dream
it
frightened
me
soâ€™
lawford
rose
very
slowly
from
his
knees
he
could
feel
in
the
dark
his
brows
drawn
down
there
came
a
low
sullen
beating
on
his
ear
he
saw
his
face
as
it
were
in
dim
outline
against
the
dark
rage
and
rebellion
surged
up
in
him
even
his
love
could
be
turned
to
bitterness
well
two
could
play
at
any
game
alice
sprang
up
in
bed
and
caught
his
sleeve
â€˜dearest
dearest
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
nowâ€™
he
flung
himself
down
beside
the
bed
anger
resentment
died
away
â€˜you
are
all
i
have
leftâ€™
he
said
he
stole
back
as
he
had
come
in
the
clear
dawn
to
his
bedroom
it
was
not
five
yet
he
put
a
few
more
coals
on
his
fire
and
blew
out
the
night-light
and
lay
down
but
it
was
impossible
to
rest
to
remain
inactive
he
would
go
down
and
search
for
that
first
volume
of
quain
hallucination
influenza
insanity--why
sheila
must
have
purposely
mislaid
it
a
rather
formidable
figure
he
looked
descending
the
stairs
in
the
grey
dusk
of
daybreak
the
breakfast-room
was
at
the
back
of
the
house
he
tilted
the
blind
and
a
faint
light
flowed
in
from
the
changing
colours
of
the
sky
he
opened
the
glass
door
of
the
little
bookcase
to
the
right
of
the
window
and
ran
eye
and
finger
over
the
few
rows
of
books
but
as
he
stood
there
with
his
back
to
the
room
just
as
the
shadow
of
a
birdâ€™s
wing
floats
across
the
moonlight
of
a
pool
he
became
suddenly
conscious
that
something
somebody
had
passed
across
the
doorway
and
in
passing
had
looked
in
on
him
he
stood
motionless
listening
but
no
sound
broke
the
morning
slumbrousness
except
the
faraway
warbling
of
a
thrush
in
the
first
light
so
sudden
and
transitory
had
been
the
experience
that
it
seemed
now
to
be
illusory
yet
it
had
so
caught
him
up
it
had
with
so
furtive
and
sinister
a
quietness
broken
in
on
his
solitude
that
for
a
moment
he
dared
not
move
a
cold
indefinite
sensation
stole
over
him
that
he
was
being
watched
that
some
dim
evil
presence
was
behind
him
biding
its
time
patient
and
stealthy
with
eyes
fixed
unmovingly
on
him
where
he
stood
but
watch
and
wait
as
silently
as
he
might
only
the
day
broadened
at
the
window
and
at
last
a
narrow
ray
of
sunlight
stole
trembling
up
into
the
dusky
bowl
of
the
sky
at
any
rate
quain
was
found
with
all
the
ills
of
life
from
a
to
i
and
lawford
turned
back
to
his
bondage
with
the
book
under
his
arm
the
sabbath
pale
with
september
sunshine
and
monotonous
with
chiming
bells
had
passed
languidly
away
dr
simon
had
come
and
gone
optimistic
and
urbane
yet
with
a
faint
inward
dissatisfaction
over
a
patient
behind
whose
taciturnity
a
hint
of
mockery
and
subterfuge
seemed
to
lurk
even
mrs
lawford
had
appeared
to
share
her
husbandâ€™s
reticence
but
dr
simon
had
happened
on
other
cases
in
his
experience
where
tact
was
required
rather
than
skill
and
time
than
medicine
the
voices
and
footsteps
even
the
frou-frou
of
worshippers
going
to
church
the
voices
and
footsteps
of
worshippers
returning
from
church
had
floated
up
to
the
patientâ€™s
open
window
sunlight
had
drawn
across
his
room
in
one
pale
beam
and
vanished
a
few
callers
had
called
hothouse
flowers
waxen
and
pale
had
been
left
with
messages
of
sympathy
even
dr
critchett
had
respectfully
and
discreetly
made
inquiries
on
his
way
home
from
chapel
lawford
had
spent
most
of
his
time
in
pacing
to
and
fro
in
his
soft
slippers
the
very
monotony
had
eased
his
mind
now
and
again
he
had
lain
motionless
with
his
face
to
the
ceiling
he
had
dozed
and
had
awakened
cold
and
torpid
with
dream
he
had
hardly
been
aware
of
the
process
but
every
hour
had
done
something
it
seemed
towards
clarifying
his
point
of
view
a
consciousness
had
begun
to
stir
in
him
that
was
neither
that
of
the
old
easy
lawford
whom
he
had
never
been
fully
aware
of
before
nor
of
this
strange
ghostly
intelligence
that
haunted
the
hawklike
restless
face
and
plucked
so
insistently
at
his
distracted
nerves
he
had
begun
in
a
vague
fashion
to
be
aware
of
them
both
could
in
a
fashion
discriminate
between
them
almost
as
if
there
really
were
two
spirits
in
stubborn
conflict
within
him
it
would
of
course
wear
him
down
in
time
there
could
be
only
one
end
to
such
a
struggle--the
end
all
day
he
had
longed
for
freedom
on
and
on
with
craving
for
the
open
sky
for
solitude
for
green
silence
beyond
these
maddening
walls
this
heedful
silken
coming
and
going
these
sunday
voices
this
reiterant
yelp
of
a
single
peevish
bell--would
they
never
cease
and
above
all
betwixt
dread
and
an
almost
physical
greed
he
hungered
for
night
he
sat
down
with
elbows
on
knees
and
head
on
his
hands
thinking
of
night
its
secrecy
its
immeasurable
solitude
his
eyelids
twitched
the
fire
before
him
had
for
an
instant
gone
black
out
he
seemed
to
see
slow-gesturing
branches
grass
stooping
beneath
a
grey
and
wind-swept
sky
he
started
up
and
the
remembrance
of
the
morning
returned
to
him--the
glassy
light
the
changing
rays
the
beaming
gilt
upon
the
useless
books
now
at
last
at
the
windows
afternoon
had
begun
to
wane
and
when
sheila
brought
up
his
tea
as
if
chance
had
heard
his
cry
she
entered
in
hat
and
stole
she
put
down
the
tray
and
paused
at
the
glass
looking
across
it
out
of
the
window
â€˜alice
says
you
are
to
eat
every
one
of
those
delicious
sandwiches
and
especially
the
tiny
omelette
you
have
scarcely
touched
anything
to-day
arthur
i
am
a
poor
one
to
preach
i
am
afraid
but
you
know
what
that
will
mean--a
worse
breakdown
still
you
really
must
try
to
think
of--of
us
allâ€™
â€˜are
you
going
to
churchâ€™
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
â€˜not
of
course
if
you
would
prefer
not
but
dr
simon
advised
me
most
particularly
to
go
out
at
least
once
a
day
we
must
remember
this
is
not
the
beginning
of
your
illness
long-continued
anxiety
i
suppose
does
tell
on
one
in
time
anyhow
he
said
that
i
looked
worried
and
run-down
i
am
worried
let
us
both
try
for
each
otherâ€™s
sakes
or
even
if
only
for
aliceâ€™s
to--to
do
all
we
can
i
must
not
harass
you
but
is
there
any--do
you
see
the
slightest
change
of
any
kindâ€™
â€˜you
always
look
pretty
sheila
to-night
you
look
prettier
that
is
the
only
change
i
thinkâ€™
mrs
lawfordâ€™s
attitude
intensified
in
its
stillness
â€˜now
speaking
quite
frankly
what
is
it
in
you
suggests
these
remarks
at
such
a
time
thatâ€™s
what
baffles
me
it
seems
so
childish
so
needlessly
blindâ€™
â€˜i
am
very
sorry
sheila
to
be
so
childish
but
iâ€™m
not
say
what
you
like
blind
you
are
pretty
iâ€™d
repeat
it
if
i
was
burning
at
the
stakeâ€™
sheila
lowered
her
eyes
softly
on
to
the
rich-toned
picture
in
the
glass
â€˜supposingâ€™
she
said
watching
her
lips
move
â€˜supposing--of
course
i
know
you
are
getting
better
and
all
that--but
supposing
you
donâ€™t
change
back
as
mr
bethany
thinks
what
will
you
do
honestly
arthur
when
i
think
over
it
calmly
the
whole
tragedy
comes
back
on
me
with
such
a
force
it
sweeps
me
off
my
feet
i
am
for
the
moment
scarcely
my
own
mistress
what
would
you
doâ€™
â€˜i
think
sheilaâ€™
replied
a
low
infinitely
weary
voice
â€˜i
think
i
should
marry
againâ€™
it
was
the
same
wavering
faintly
ironical
voice
that
had
slightly
discomposed
dr
simon
that
same
morning
â€˜â€œmarry
againâ€â€™
exclaimed
incredulously
the
full
lips
in
the
looking-glass
â€˜whoâ€™
â€˜you
dearâ€™
sheila
turned
softly
round
conscious
in
a
most
humiliating
manner
that
she
had
ever
so
little
flushed
her
husband
was
pouring
out
his
tea
unaware
apparently
of
her
change
of
position
she
watched
him
curiously
in
spite
of
all
her
reason
of
her
absolute
certainty
she
wondered
even
again
for
a
moment
if
this
really
could
be
arthur
and
for
the
first
time
she
realised
the
power
and
mastery
of
that
eager
and
far
too
hungry
face
her
mind
seemed
to
pause
fluttering
in
air
like
a
bird
in
the
wind
she
hastened
rather
unsteadily
to
the
door
â€˜will
you
want
anything
more
do
you
think
for
an
hourâ€™
she
asked
her
husband
looked
up
over
his
little
table
â€˜is
alice
going
with
youâ€™
â€˜oh
yes
poor
child
she
looks
so
pale
and
miserable
we
are
going
to
mrs
sherwinâ€™s
and
then
on
to
church
you
will
lock
your
doorâ€™
â€˜yes
i
will
lock
my
doorâ€™
â€˜and
i
do
hope
arthur--nothing
rashâ€™
a
change
that
seemed
almost
the
effect
of
actual
shadow
came
over
his
face
â€˜i
wish
you
could
stay
with
meâ€™
he
said
slowly
â€˜i
donâ€™t
think
you
have
any
idea
what--what
i
go
throughâ€™
it
was
as
if
a
child
had
asked
on
the
verge
of
terror
for
a
candle
in
the
dark
but
an
hourâ€™s
terror
is
better
than
a
lifetime
of
timidity
sheila
sighed
â€˜i
thinkâ€™
she
said
â€˜i
too
might
say
that
but
there
giving
way
will
do
nothing
for
either
of
us
i
shall
be
gone
only
for
an
hour
or
two
at
the
most
and
i
told
mr
bethany
i
should
have
to
come
out
before
the
sermon
itâ€™s
only
mr
craikâ€™
â€˜but
why
mrs
sherwin
sheâ€™d
worm
a
secret
out
of
oneâ€™s
graveâ€™
â€˜itâ€™s
useless
to
discuss
that
arthur
you
have
always
consistently
disliked
my
friends
itâ€™s
scarcely
likely
that
you
would
find
any
improvement
in
them
nowâ€™
â€˜oh
well--â€™
he
began
but
the
door
was
already
closed
â€˜sheilaâ€™
he
called
in
a
burst
of
anger
â€˜well
arthurâ€™
â€˜you
have
taken
my
latchkeyâ€™
sheila
came
hastily
in
again
â€˜your
latchkeyâ€™
â€˜i
am
going
outâ€™
â€˜â€œgoing
outâ€--you
will
not
be
so
mad
so
criminal
and
after
your
promiseâ€™
he
stood
up
â€˜it
is
useless
to
argue
if
i
do
not
go
out
i
shall
certainly
go
mad
as
for
criminal--why
thatâ€™s
a
womanâ€™s
word
who
on
earth
is
to
know
meâ€™
â€˜it
is
of
no
consequence
then
that
the
servants
are
already
gossiping
about
this
impossible
dr
ferguson
that
you
are
certain
to
be
seen
either
going
or
returning
that
alice
is
bound
to
discover
that
you
are
well
enough
to
go
out
and
yet
not
even
enough
to
say
good-night
to
your
own
daughter--oh
itâ€™s
monstrous
itâ€™s
a
frantic
a
heartless
thing
to
doâ€™
her
voice
vaguely
suggested
tears
lawford
eyed
her
coldly
and
stubbornly--thinking
of
the
empty
room
he
would
leave
awaiting
his
return
its
lamp
burning
its
fire-flames
shining
it
was
almost
a
physical
discomfort
this
longing
unspeakable
for
the
twilight
the
green
secrecy
and
the
silence
of
the
graves
â€˜keep
them
out
of
the
wayâ€™
he
said
in
a
low
voice
â€˜it
will
be
dark
when
i
come
inâ€™
his
hardened
face
lit
up
â€˜itâ€™s
useless
to
attempt
to
dissuade
meâ€™
â€˜why
must
you
always
be
hurting
me
why
do
you
seem
to
delight
in
trying
to
estrange
meâ€™
husband
and
wife
faced
each
other
across
the
clear-lit
room
he
did
not
answer
â€˜for
the
last
timeâ€™
she
said
in
a
quiet
hard
voice
â€˜i
ask
you
not
to
goâ€™
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
â€˜ask
me
not
to
come
backâ€™
he
said
â€˜thatâ€™s
nearer
your
hopeâ€™
he
turned
his
face
to
the
fire
without
moving
he
heard
her
go
out
return
pause
and
go
out
again
and
when
he
deliberately
wheeled
round
in
his
chair
the
little
key
lay
conspicuous
there
on
the
counterpane
the
last
light
of
sunset
lay
in
the
west
and
a
sullen
wrack
of
cloud
was
mounting
into
the
windless
sky
when
lawford
entered
the
country
graveyard
again
by
its
dark
weather-worn
lych-gate
the
old
stone
church
with
its
square
tower
stood
amid
trees
its
eastern
window
faintly
aglow
with
crimson
and
purple
he
could
hear
a
steady
rather
nasal
voice
through
its
open
lattices
but
the
stooping
stones
and
the
cypresses
were
out
of
sight
of
its
porch
he
would
not
be
seen
down
there
he
paused
a
moment
however
his
hat
was
drawn
down
over
his
eyes
he
was
shivering
far
over
the
harvest
fields
showed
a
growing
pallor
in
the
solitary
seat
beneath
the
cypresses
he
stood
hesitating
gazing
steadily
and
yet
half
vacantly
at
the
motionless
figure
and
in
a
while
a
face
was
lifted
in
his
direction
and
undisconcerted
eyes
calmly
surveyed
him
â€˜i
am
afraidâ€™
called
lawford
rather
nervously--â€˜i
hope
i
am
not
intrudingâ€™
â€˜not
at
all
not
at
allâ€™
said
the
stranger
â€˜i
have
no
privileges
here
at
least
as
yetâ€™
lawford
again
hesitated
then
slowly
advanced
â€˜itâ€™s
astonishingly
quiet
and
beautifulâ€™
he
said
the
stranger
turned
his
head
to
glance
over
the
fields
â€˜yes
it
is
veryâ€™
he
replied
there
was
the
faintest
accent
a
little
drawl
of
unfriendliness
in
the
remark
â€˜you
often
sit
hereâ€™
lawford
persisted
the
stranger
raised
his
eyebrows
â€˜oh
yes
oftenâ€™
he
smiled
â€˜it
is
my
own
modest
fashion
of
attending
divine
service
the
congregation
is
raptâ€™
â€˜my
visitsâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜have
been
very
few--in
fact
so
far
as
i
know
i
have
only
once
been
here
beforeâ€™
â€˜i
envy
you
the
noveltyâ€™
there
was
again
the
same
faint
unmistakable
antagonism
in
voice
and
attitude
and
yet
so
deep
was
the
relief
in
talking
to
a
fellow
creature
who
hadnâ€™t
the
least
suspicion
of
anything
unusual
in
his
appearance
that
lawford
was
extremely
disinclined
to
turn
back
he
made
another
effort--for
conversation
with
strangers
had
always
been
a
difficulty
to
him--and
advanced
towards
the
seat
â€˜you
mustnâ€™t
please
let
me
intrude
upon
youâ€™
he
said
â€˜but
really
i
am
very
interested
in
this
queer
old
place
perhaps
you
would
tell
me
something
of
its
historyâ€™
he
sat
down
his
companion
moved
slowly
to
the
other
side
of
the
broken
gravestone
â€˜to
tell
you
the
truthâ€™
he
replied
picking
his
way
as
it
were
from
word
to
word
â€˜itâ€™s
â€œhistoryâ€
as
people
call
it
does
not
interest
me
in
the
least
after
all
itâ€™s
not
when
a
thing
is
but
what
it
is
that
much
matters
what
this
isâ€™--he
glanced
with
head
bent
across
the
shadowy
stones
â€˜is
pretty
evident
of
course
age
has
its
charmsâ€™
â€˜and
is
this
very
oldâ€™
â€˜oh
yes
itâ€™s
old
right
enough
as
things
go
but
even
age
perhaps
is
mainly
an
affair
of
the
imagination
thereâ€™s
a
tombstone
near
that
little
old
hawthorn
and
there
are
two
others
side
by
side
under
the
wall
still
even
legibly
late
seventeenth
century
thatâ€™s
pretty
good
weatheringâ€™
he
smiled
faintly
â€˜of
course
the
church
itself
is
centuries
older
drenched
with
age
but
sheâ€™s
still
sleep-walking
while
these
old
tombstones
dream
glow-worms
and
crickets
are
not
such
bad
bedfellowsâ€™
â€˜what
interested
me
most
i
thinkâ€™
said
lawford
haltingly
â€˜was
thisâ€™
he
pointed
with
his
stick
to
the
grave
at
his
feet
â€˜ah
yes
sabathierâ€™sâ€™
said
the
stranger
â€˜i
know
his
peculiar
history
almost
by
heartâ€™
lawford
found
himself
staring
with
unusual
concentration
into
the
rather
long
and
pale
face
â€˜not
i
supposeâ€™
he
resumed
faintly--â€˜not
i
suppose
beyond
whatâ€™s
thereâ€™
his
companion
leant
his
hand
on
the
old
stooping
tombstone
â€˜well
you
know
thereâ€™s
a
good
deal
thereâ€™--he
stooped
over--â€˜if
you
read
between
the
lines
even
if
you
donâ€™tâ€™
â€˜a
suicideâ€™
said
lawford
under
his
breath
â€˜yes
a
suicide
thatâ€™s
why
our
christian
countrymen
have
buried
him
outside
of
the
fold
dead
or
alive
they
try
to
keep
the
wolf
outâ€™
â€˜is
this
then
unconsecrated
groundâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜havenâ€™t
you
noticedâ€™
drawled
the
other
â€˜how
green
the
grass
grows
down
here
and
how
very
sharp
are
poor
old
sabathierâ€™s
thorns
besides
he
was
a
stranger
and
they--kept
him
outâ€™
â€˜but
surelyâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜was
it
so
entirely
a
matter
of
choice--the
laws
of
the
church
if
he
did
kill
himself
he
didâ€™
the
stranger
turned
with
a
little
shrug
â€˜i
donâ€™t
suppose
itâ€™s
a
matter
of
much
consequence
to
him
i
fancied
i
was
his
only
friend
may
i
venture
to
ask
why
you
are
interested
in
the
poor
old
thingâ€™
lawfordâ€™s
mind
was
as
calm
and
shallow
as
a
millpond
â€˜oh
a
rather
unusual
thing
happened
to
me
hereâ€™
he
said
â€˜you
say
you
often
comeâ€™
â€˜oftenâ€™
said
the
stranger
rather
curtly
â€˜has
anything--ever--occurredâ€™
â€˜â€œoccurredâ€â€™
he
raised
his
eyebrows
â€˜i
wish
it
had
i
come
here
simply
as
i
have
said
because
itâ€™s
quiet
because
i
prefer
the
company
of
those
who
never
answer
me
back
and
who
do
not
so
much
as
condescend
to
pay
me
the
least
attentionâ€™
he
smiled
and
turned
his
face
towards
the
quiet
fields
lawford
after
a
long
pause
lifted
his
eyes
â€˜do
you
thinkâ€™
he
said
softly
â€˜it
is
possible
one
ever
couldâ€™
â€˜â€œone
ever
couldâ€â€™
â€˜answer
backâ€™
there
was
a
low
rotting
wall
of
stone
encompassing
sabathierâ€™s
grave
on
this
the
stranger
sat
down
he
glanced
up
rather
curiously
at
his
companion
â€˜seldom
the
time
and
the
place
and
the
revenant
altogether
the
thought
has
occurred
to
othersâ€™
he
ventured
to
add
â€˜of
course
of
courseâ€™
said
lawford
eagerly
â€˜but
it
is
an
absolutely
new
one
to
me
i
donâ€™t
mean
that
i
have
never
had
such
an
idea
just
in
oneâ€™s
own
superficial
way
butâ€™--he
paused
and
glanced
swiftly
into
the
fast-thickening
twilight--â€˜i
wonder
are
they
do
you
think
really
all
quite
deadâ€™
â€˜call
and
seeâ€™
taunted
the
stranger
softly
â€˜ah
yes
i
knowâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜but
i
believe
in
the
resurrection
of
the
body
that
is
what
we
say
and
supposing
when
a
man
dies--supposing
it
was
most
frightfully
against
oneâ€™s
will
that
one
hated
the
awful
inaction
that
death
brings
shutting
a
poor
devil
up
like
a
child
kicking
against
the
door
in
a
dark
cupboard
one
might
surely
one
might--just
quietly
you
know
try
to
get
out
wouldnâ€™t
youâ€™
he
added
â€˜and
surelyâ€™
he
found
himself
beginning
gently
to
argue
again
â€˜surely
what
about
say
himâ€™
he
nodded
towards
the
old
and
broken
grave
that
lay
between
them
â€˜what
sabathierâ€™
the
other
echoed
laying
his
hand
upon
the
stone
and
a
sheer
enormous
abyss
of
silence
seemed
to
follow
the
unanswerable
question
â€˜he
was
a
stranger
it
says
so
good
godâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜how
he
must
have
wanted
to
get
home
he
killed
himself
poor
wretch
think
of
the
fret
and
fever
he
must
have
been
in--just
before
imagine
itâ€™
â€˜but
it
might
you
knowâ€™
suggested
the
other
with
a
smile--â€˜might
have
been
sheer
indifferenceâ€™
â€˜â€œnicholas
sabathier
stranger
to
this
parishâ€--no
noâ€™
said
lawford
his
heart
beating
as
if
it
would
choke
him
â€˜i
donâ€™t
fancy
it
was
indifferenceâ€™
it
was
almost
too
dark
now
to
distinguish
the
strangerâ€™s
features
but
there
seemed
a
faint
suggestion
of
irony
in
his
voice
â€˜and
how
do
you
suppose
your
angry
naughty
child
would
set
about
it
itâ€™s
narrow
quarters
how
would
he
beginâ€™
lawford
sat
quite
still
â€˜you
say--i
hope
i
am
not
detaining
you--you
say
you
have
come
here
sat
here
often
on
this
very
seat
have
you
ever
had--have
you
ever
fallen
asleep
hereâ€™
â€˜why
do
you
askâ€™
inquired
the
other
curiously
â€˜i
was
only
wonderingâ€™
said
lawford
he
was
cold
and
shivering
he
felt
instinctively
it
was
madness
to
sit
on
here
in
the
thin
gliding
mist
that
had
gathered
in
swathes
above
the
grass
milk-pale
in
the
rising
moon
the
stranger
turned
away
from
him
â€˜â€œfor
in
that
sleep
of
death
what
dreams
may
come
must
give
us
pauseâ€â€™
he
said
slowly
with
a
little
satirical
catch
on
the
last
word
â€˜what
did
you
dreamâ€™
lawford
glanced
helplessly
about
him
the
moon
cast
lean
grey
beams
of
light
between
the
cypresses
but
to
his
wide
and
wandering
eyes
it
seemed
that
a
radiance
other
than
hers
haunted
these
mounds
and
leaning
stones
â€˜have
you
ever
noticed
itâ€™
he
said
putting
out
his
hand
towards
his
unknown
companion
â€˜this
stone
is
cracked
from
head
to
foot
but
thereâ€™--he
rose
stiff
and
chilled--â€˜i
am
afraid
i
have
bored
you
with
my
company
you
came
here
for
solitude
and
i
have
been
trying
to
convince
you
that
we
are
surrounded
with
witnesses
you
will
forgive
my
intrusionâ€™
there
was
a
kind
of
old-fashioned
courtesy
in
his
manner
that
he
himself
was
dimly
aware
of
he
held
out
his
hand
â€˜i
hope
you
will
think
nothing
of
the
kindâ€™
said
the
other
earnestly
â€˜how
could
it
be
in
any
sense
an
intrusion
itâ€™s
the
old
story
of
bluebeard
and
i
confess
i
too
should
very
much
like
a
peep
into
his
cupboard
who
wouldnâ€™t
but
there
itâ€™s
merely
a
matter
of
time
i
supposeâ€™
he
paused
and
together
they
slowly
ascended
the
path
already
glimmering
with
a
heavy
dew
at
the
porch
they
paused
once
more
and
now
it
was
the
stranger
that
held
out
his
hand
â€˜perhapsâ€™
he
said
â€˜you
will
give
me
the
pleasure
of
some
day
continuing
our
talk
as
for
our
friend
below
it
so
happens
that
i
have
managed
to
pick
up
a
little
more
of
his
history
than
the
sexton
seems
to
have
heard
of--if
you
would
care
some
time
or
other
to
share
it
i
live
only
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
not
half
a
mile
distant
perhaps
you
could
spare
the
time
nowâ€™
lawford
took
out
his
watch
â€˜you
are
really
very
kindâ€™
he
said
â€˜but
perhaps--well
whatever
that
history
may
be
i
think
you
would
agree
that
mine
is
even--but
there
iâ€™ve
talked
too
much
about
myself
already
perhaps
to-morrowâ€™
â€˜why
to-morrow
thenâ€™
said
his
companion
â€˜itâ€™s
a
flat
wooden
house
on
the
left-hand
side
come
at
any
time
of
the
eveningâ€™
he
paused
again
and
smiled--â€˜the
third
house
after
the
rectory
which
is
marked
up
on
the
gate
my
name
is
herbert--herbert
herbert
to
be
preciseâ€™
lawford
took
out
his
pocket-book
and
a
card
â€˜mineâ€™
he
said
handing
it
gravely
to
his
companion
â€˜is
lawford--at
leastâ€™
it
was
really
the
first
time
that
either
had
seen
the
otherâ€™s
face
at
close
quarters
and
clear-lit
and
on
lawfordâ€™s
a
moon
almost
at
the
full
shone
dazzlingly
he
saw
an
expression--dismay
incredulity
overwhelming
astonishment--start
suddenly
into
the
dark
rather
indifferent
eyes
â€˜what
is
itâ€™
he
cried
hastily
stooping
close
â€˜whyâ€™
said
the
other
laughing
and
turning
away
â€˜i
think
the
moon
must
have
bewitched
me
tooâ€™
lawford
listened
awhile
before
opening
his
door
he
heard
voices
in
the
dining-room
a
light
shone
faintly
between
the
blinds
of
his
bedroom
he
very
gently
let
himself
in
and
unheard
unseen
mounted
the
stairs
he
sat
down
in
front
of
the
fire
tired
out
and
bitterly
cold
in
spite
of
his
long
walk
home
but
his
mind
was
wearier
even
than
his
body
he
tried
in
vain
to
catch
up
the
thread
of
his
thoughts
he
only
knew
for
certain
that
so
far
as
his
first
hope
and
motives
had
gone
his
errand
had
proved
entirely
futile
â€˜how
could
i
possibly
fall
asleep
with
that
fellow
talking
thereâ€™
he
had
said
to
himself
angrily
yet
knew
in
his
heart
that
their
talk
had
driven
every
other
idea
out
of
his
mind
he
had
not
yet
even
glanced
into
the
glass
his
every
thought
was
vainly
wandering
round
and
round
the
one
curious
hint
that
had
drifted
in
but
which
he
had
not
yet
been
able
to
put
into
words
supposing
though
that
he
had
really
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep
with
none
to
watch
or
spy--what
then
however
ridiculous
that
idea
it
was
not
more
ridiculous
more
incredible
than
the
actual
fact
if
he
had
remained
there
he
might
it
was
just
possible
that
he
would
by
now
have
actually
awakened
just
his
own
familiar
every-day
self
again
and
the
thought
of
that--though
he
hardly
realised
its
full
import--actually
did
send
him
on
tip-toe
for
a
glance
that
more
or
less
effectually
set
the
question
at
rest
and
there
looked
out
at
him
it
seemed
the
same
dark
sallow
face
that
had
so
much
appalled
him
only
two
nights
ago--expressionless
cadaverous
with
shadowy
hollows
beneath
the
glittering
eyes
and
even
as
he
watched
it
its
lips
of
their
own
volition
drew
together
and
questioned
him--â€˜whoseâ€™
he
was
not
to
be
given
much
leisure
however
for
fantastic
reveries
like
this
as
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
hands
gladly
conscious
that
he
could
not
possibly
bear
this
incessant
strain
for
long
sheila
opened
the
door
he
started
up
â€˜i
wish
you
would
knockâ€™
he
said
angrily
â€˜you
talk
of
quiet
you
tell
me
to
rest
and
think
and
here
you
come
creeping
and
spying
on
me
as
if
i
was
a
child
in
a
nursery
i
refuse
to
be
watched
and
guarded
and
peeped
on
like
thisâ€™
he
knew
that
his
hands
were
trembling
that
he
could
not
keep
his
eyes
fixed
that
his
voice
was
nearly
inarticulate
sheila
drew
in
her
lips
â€˜i
have
merely
come
to
tell
you
arthur
that
mr
bethany
has
brought
mr
danton
in
to
supper

me
it
really
would
be
advisable

take
such
a
very
old
and
prudent
and
practical
friend
into
our
confidence

do
nothing

incessant
anxiety

look
positively
at
deathâ€™s
doorâ€™
â€˜what--what
an
instinct
you
have
for
the
right
wordâ€™
said
lawford
softly
â€˜and
danton
of
all
people
in
the
world
it
was
surely
rather
a
curious
a
thoughtless
choice

had

â€˜why

â€˜he

â€˜i

sheila
indignantly
â€˜it

hardly

old

true

such--well
vulgar
terms
as
that
besides
arthur
as
for

in
the
least
desiring
to
hurt
your
feelings--i
must
candidly
warn
you
some
people
wonâ€™tâ€™
â€˜come
alongâ€™
said
lawford
with
a
faint
gust
of
laughter
â€˜letâ€™s
seeâ€™
they
went
quickly
downstairs
sheila
with
less
dignity
perhaps
than
she
had
been
surprised
into
since
she
had
left
a
slimmer
girlhood
behind
she
swept
into
the
gaze
of
the
two
gentlemen
standing
together
on
the
hearthrug
and
so
was
caught
as
it
were
between
a
rain
of
conflicting
glances
for
her
husband
had
followed
instantly
and
stood
now
behind
her
stooping
a
little
and
with
something
between
contempt
and
defiance
confronting
an
old
fat
friend
whom
that
one
brief
challenging
instant
had
congealed
into
a
condition
of
passive
and
immovable
hostility
mr
danton
composed
his
chin
in
his
collar
and
deliberately
turned
himself
towards
his
companion
his
small
eyes
wandered
and
instantaneously
met
and
rested
on
those
of
mrs
lawford
â€˜arthur
thought
he
would
prefer
to
come
down
and
see
you

â€˜you

said
mr

in
a
dry
difficult
voice

danton
began
huskily
â€˜i

said
he
stirring
vaguely
glancing
restlessly
â€˜it
was
not

come
at
allâ€™
said
a
voice
from
the
doorway
â€˜to
tell

truth

am
too
tired

a

lifted
a
long
arm--â€˜i

danton
in

rich
still
voice
â€˜oh

drawled
on

slightly
hesitating
long-drawn
syllables

a
convulsive

woke

turned
swiftly
on

cried
â€˜itâ€™s

â€˜lawfordâ€™

was
as
sharp
as
the
crack
of
a
whip

lawford
peered
as
if
out
of
a
gathering
dusk
that
thickened
and
flickered
with
shadows
before
his
eyes
â€˜whatâ€™s
he
mean
thenâ€™
he
muttered
huskily
â€˜coming
here
with
his
black
still
carcase--peeping
peeping--whatâ€™s
he
mean
i
sayâ€™
there
was
a
momentâ€™s
silence
then
with
lifted
brows
and
wide
eyes
that
to
every
one
of
his
three
witnesses
left
an
indelible
memory
of
clear
and
wolfish
light
within
their
glassy
pupils
he
turned
heavily
and
climbed
back
to
his
solitude
â€˜i
supposeâ€™
began
danton
with
an
obvious
effort
to
disentangle
himself
from
the
humiliation
of
the
moment
â€˜i
suppose
he
was--wanderingâ€™
â€˜bless
me
yesâ€™
said
mr
bethany
cordially--â€˜fever
we
all
know
what
that
meansâ€™
â€˜yesâ€™
said
danton
taking
refuge
in
mrs
lawfordâ€™s
white
and
intent
gaze
â€˜just
think
think
danton--the
awful
incessant
strain
of
such
an
ordeal
think
for
an
instant
what
such
a
thing
meansâ€™
danton
inserted
a
plump
white
finger
between
collar
and
chin
â€˜oh
yes
but--eh--needlessly
abusive
i
never
said
i
disbelieved
himâ€™
â€˜do
youâ€™
said
mrs
lawfordâ€™s
voice
he
poised
himself
as
if
it
were
on
the
monolithic
stability
of
his
legs
â€˜ehâ€™
he
said
mr
bethany
sat
down
at
the
table
â€˜i
rather
feared
some
such
temporary
breakdown
as
this
danton
i
think
i
foresaw
it
and
now
just
while
we
are
all
three
alone
here
together
in
friendly
conclave
wouldnâ€™t
it
be
as
well
donâ€™t
you
think
to
confront
ourselves
with
the
difficulties
i
know--we
all
know
that
that
poor
half-demented
creature
is
arthur
lawford
this
morning
he
was
as
sane
as
lucid
as
i
hope
i
am
now
an
awful
calamity
has
suddenly
fallen
upon
him--this
change
i
own
frankly
at
the
first
sheer
shock
it
staggered
me
as
i
think
for
the
moment
it
has
staggered
you
but
when
i
had
seen
the
poor
fellow
face
to
face
heard
him
talk
and
watched
him
there
upstairs
in
the
silence
stir
and
awake
and
come
up
again
to
his
trouble
out
of
his
sleep
i
had
no
more
doubt
in
my
own
mind
and
heart
that
he
was
he
than
i
have
in
my
mind
that
i--am
i
we
do
in
some
mysterious
way
youâ€™ll
own
at
once
grow
so
accustomed
so
inured
if
you
like
to
each
otherâ€™s
faces
masks
though
they
be
that
we
hardly
realise
we
see
them
when
we
are
speaking
together
and
yet
the
slightest
the
most
infinitesimal
change
is
instantly
apparentâ€™
â€˜oh
yes
vicar
but
you
see--â€™
mr
bethany
raised
a
small
lean
hand
â€˜one
moment
please
i
have
heard
lawfordâ€™s
own
account
conscious
or
unconscious
he
has
been
through
some
terrific
strain
some
such
awful
conflict
with
the
unseen
powers
that
we--thank
god--have
only
read
about
and
never
perhaps
until
death
is
upon
us
shall
witness
for
ourselves
what
more
likely
more
inevitable
than
that
such
a
thing
should
leave
its
scar
its
cloud
its
masking
shadow--call
it
what
you
will
a
smile
can
turn
a
face
we
dread
into
a
face
weâ€™d
die
for
some
experience
which
would
be
nothing
but
a
hideous
cruelty
and
outrage
to
ask
too
closely
about--one
perhaps
which
he
could
even
if
he
would
poor
fellow
give
no
account
of--has
put
him
temporarily
at
the
worldâ€™s
mercy
they
made
him
a
nine
daysâ€™
wonder
a
byword
and
that
my
dear
danton
is
just
where
we
come
in
we
know
the
man
himself
and
it
is
to
be
our
privilege
to
act
as
a
buffer-state
to
be
intermediaries
between
him
and
the
rest
of
this
deadly
craving
sheepish
world--for
the
time
being
oh
yes
just
for
the
time
being
other
and
keener
and
more
knowledgeable
minds
than
mine
or
yours
will
some
day
bring
him
back
to
us
again
we
donâ€™t
attempt
to
explain
we
canâ€™t
we
simply
believeâ€™
but
danton
merely
continued
to
stare
as
if
into
the
quiet
of
an
aquarium
â€˜my
dear
good
dantonâ€™
persisted
mr
bethany
with
cherubic
patience
â€˜how
old
are
youâ€™
â€˜i
donâ€™t
see
quiteâ€™
smiled
danton
with
recovered
ease
and
rapidly
mobilising
forces
â€˜excuse
the
confidence
mrs
lawford
iâ€™m
forty-threeâ€™
â€˜goodâ€™
said
mr
bethany
â€˜and
iâ€™m
seventy-one
and
this
child
hereâ€™--he
pointed
an
accusing
finger
at
sheila--is
youth
perpetual
soâ€™
he
briskly
brightened
â€˜say
between
us
weâ€™re
six
score
all
told
are
we--can
we
deliberately
with
this
mere
pinch
of
years
at
our
command
out
of
the
wheeling
millions
that
have
gone--can
we
say
â€œthis
is
impossibleâ€
to
any
single
phenomenon
can
weâ€™
â€˜no
we
canâ€™t
of
courseâ€™
said
danton
formidably
â€˜not
finally
thatâ€™s
all
very
well
butâ€™--he
paused
and
nodded
nodding
his
round
head
upward
as
if
towards
the
inaudible
overhead
â€˜i
suppose
he
canâ€™t
hearâ€™
mr
bethany
rose
cheerfully
â€˜all
right
danton
i
am
afraid
you
are
exactly
what
the
poor
fellow
in
his
delirium
solemnly
asseverated
and
jesting
apart
it
is
in
delirium
that
we
tell
our
sheer
plain
unadulterated
truth
youâ€™re
a
nicely
covered
sceptic
personally
i
refuse
to
discuss
the
matter
mere
dull
stubborn
prejudice
bigotry
if
you
like
i
will
only
remark
just
this--that
mrs
lawford
and
i
in
our
inmost
hearts
know
you
my
dear
danton
forgive
the
freedom
merely
incredulously
grope
faith
versus
reason--that
prehistoric
armageddon
some
day
and
a
day
not
far
distant
either
lawford
will
come
back
to
us
this--this
shutter
will
be
taken
down
as
abruptly
as
by
some
inconceivably
drowsy
heedlessness
of
common
nature
it
has
been
put
up
heâ€™ll
win
through
and
of
his
own
sheer
will
and
courage
but
now
because
i
ask
it
and
this
poor
child
here
entreats
it
you
will
say
nothing
to
a
living
soul
about
the
matter
say
till
friday
what
step-by-step
creatures
we
are
to
be
sure
i
say
friday
because
it
will
be
exactly
a
week
then
and
whatâ€™s
a
week--to
nature
scarcely
the
unfolding
of
a
rose
but
still
friday
be
it
then
if
nothing
has
occurred
we
will
we
shall
have
to
call
a
friendly
gathering
we
shall
be
compelled
to
have
a
friendly
consultationâ€™
â€˜iâ€™m
not
i
hope
a
brute
bethanyâ€™
said
danton
apologetically
â€˜but
honestly
speaking
for
myself
simply
as
a
man
of
the
world
itâ€™s
a
big
risk
to
be
taking
on--what
shall
we
call
it--on
mere
intuition
personally
and
even
in
a
court
of
law--though
heaven
forbid
it
ever
reaches
that
stage--personally
i
could
swear
that
the
fellow
that
stood
abusing
me
there
in
that
revolting
fashion
was
not
lawford
it
would
be
easier
even
to
believe
in
him
if
there
were
not
that--that
glaze
that
shocking
simulation
of
the
man
himself
the
very
man
but
then
i
am
a
sceptic
i
own
it
and
â€˜pon
my
word
mrs
lawford
thereâ€™s
plenty
of
room
for
sceptics
in
a
world
like
thisâ€™
â€˜very
wellâ€™
said
mr
bethany
crisply
â€˜thatâ€™s
settled
then
with
your
permission
my
dearâ€™
he
added
turning
untarnishably
clear
childlike
eyes
on
sheila
â€˜i
will
take
all
risks--even
to
the
foot
of
the
gibbet
accessory
danton
after
the
factâ€™
and
so
direct
and
cloudless
was
his
gaze
that
sheila
tried
in
vain
to
evade
it
and
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
dantonâ€™s
small
agate-like
eyes
now
completely
under
mastery
and
awaiting
confidently
the
meeting
with
her
own
â€˜of
courseâ€™
she
said
â€˜i
am
entirely
in
your
hands
dear
mr
bethanyâ€™
lawford
slept
far
into
the
cloudy
monday
morning
to
wake
steeped
in
sleep
lethargic
and
fretfully
haunted
by
inconclusive
remembrances
of
the
night
before
when
sheila
with
obvious
and
capacious
composure
brought
him
his
breakfast
tray
he
watched
her
face
for
some
time
without
speaking
â€˜sheilaâ€™
he
began
as
she
was
about
to
leave
the
room
again
she
paused
smiling
â€˜did
anything
happen
last
night
would
you
mind
telling
me
sheila
who
was
it
was
hereâ€™
her
lids
the
least
bit
narrowed
â€˜certainly
arthur
mr
danton
was
hereâ€™
â€˜then
it
was
not
a
dreamâ€™
â€˜oh
noâ€™
said
sheila
â€˜what
did
i
say
what
did
he
say
it
was
hopeless
anyhowâ€™
â€˜i
donâ€™t
quite
understand
what
you
mean
by
â€œhopelessâ€
arthur
and
must
i
answer
the
other
questionsâ€™
lawford
drew
his
hand
over
his
face
like
a
tired
child
â€˜he
didnâ€™t--believeâ€™
â€˜no
dearâ€™
said
sheila
softly
â€˜and
you
sheilaâ€™
came
the
subdued
voice
sheila
crossed
slowly
to
the
window
â€˜well
quite
honestly
arthur
i
was
not
very
much
surprised
whatever
we
are
agreed
about
on
the
whole
you
were
scarcely
yourself
last
nightâ€™
lawford
shut
his
eyes
and
re-opened
them
full
on
his
wifeâ€™s
calm
scrutiny
who
had
in
that
moment
turned
in
the
light
of
the
one
drawn
blind
to
face
him
again
â€˜who
is
alwaysâ€™
â€˜noâ€™
said
sheila
â€˜but--it
was
at
least
unfortunate
we
canâ€™t
i
suppose
rely
on
dr
bethany
aloneâ€™
lawford
crouched
over
his
food
â€˜will
he
blabâ€™
â€˜blab
mr
danton
is
a
gentleman
arthurâ€™
lawford
rolled
his
eyes
as
if
in
temporary
vertigo
â€˜yesâ€™
he
said
and
sheila
once
more
prepared
to
make
a
reposeful
exit
â€˜i
donâ€™t
think
i
can
see
simon
this
morningâ€™
â€˜oh
who
thenâ€™
â€˜i
mean
i
would
prefer
to
be
left
aloneâ€™
â€˜believe
me
i
had
no
intention
to
intrudeâ€™
and
this
time
the
door
really
closed
â€˜he
is
in
a
quiet
soothing
sleepâ€™
said
sheila
a
few
minutes
later
â€˜nothing
could
be
betterâ€™
said
dr
simon
and
lawford
to
his
inexpressible
relief
heard
the
fevered
throbbing
of
the
doctorâ€™s
car
reverse
and
turned
over
and
shut
his
eyes
dulled
and
exhausted
in
the
still
unfriendliness
of
the
vacant
room
his
spirits
had
sunk
he
thought
to
their
lowest
ebb
he
scarcely
heeded
the
fragments
of
dreams--clear
green
landscapes
amazing
gleams
of
peace
the
sudden
broken
voices
the
rustling
and
calling
shadowiness
of
subconsciousness--in
this
quiet
sunlight
of
reality
the
clouds
had
broken
or
had
been
withdrawn
like
a
veil
from
the
october
skies
one
thought
alone
was
his
refuge
one
face
alone
haunted
him
with
its
peace
one
remembrance
soothed
him--alice
through
all
his
scattered
and
purposeless
arguments
he
strove
to
remember
her
voice
the
loving-kindness
of
her
eyes
her
untroubled
confidence
in
the
afternoon
he
got
up
and
dressed
himself
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
stand
before
the
glass
and
deliberately
shave
he
even
smiled
at
the
thought
of
playing
the
barber
to
that
lean
chin
he
dressed
by
the
fireplace
â€˜i
couldnâ€™t
restâ€™
he
told
sheila
when
she
presently
came
in
on
one
of
her
quiet
cautious
heedful
visits
â€˜and
one
tires
of
reading
even
quain
in
bedâ€™
â€˜have
you
found
anythingâ€™
she
inquired
politely
â€˜oh
yesâ€™
said
lawford
wearily
â€˜i
have
discovered
that
infinitely
worse
things
are
infinitely
commoner
but
that
thereâ€™s
nothing
quite
so
picturesqueâ€™
â€˜tell
meâ€™
said
sheila
with
refreshing
naivete
â€˜how
does
it
feel
does
it
even
in
the
slightest
degree
affect
your
mindâ€™
he
turned
his
back
and
looked
up
at
his
broad
gilt
portrait
for
inspiration
â€˜practically
not
at
allâ€™
he
said
hollowly
â€˜of
course
oneâ€™s
nerves--that
fellow
danton--when
oneâ€™s
overtired
you
haveâ€™--his
voice
in
spite
of
every
effort
faintly
quavered--â€˜you
havenâ€™t
noticed
anything
my
mindâ€™
â€˜me
oh
dear
no
i
never
was
the
least
bit
observant
you
know
that
arthur
but
apart
from
that
and
i
hope
you
will
not
think
me
unsympathetic--but
donâ€™t
you
think
we
must
sooner
or
later
be
thinking
of
whatâ€™s
to
be
done
at
present
though
i
fully
agree
with
mr
bethany
as
to
the
wisdom
of
hushing
this
unhappy
business
up
as
long
as
possible
at
least
from
the
gossiping
outside
world
still
we
are
only
standing
still
and
your
malady
dear
i
suppose
isnâ€™t
you
will
help
me
arthur
you
will
try
and
think
poor
aliceâ€™
â€˜what
about
aliceâ€™
â€˜she
mopes
dear
rather
she
cannot
of
course
quite
understand
why
she
must
not
see
her
father
and
yet
his
not

or
for
the
matter
of
that
even
if
he
was
at
deathâ€™s
doorâ€™
â€˜at
deathâ€™s
doorâ€™
murmured
lawford
under
his
breath
â€˜who
was
it
was
saying
that
have
you
ever
sheila
in
a
dream
or
just
as
oneâ€™s
thoughts
go
sometimes

that
doorits
ruinous
stone
lintel
carved
into
lichenous
stone
headsstonily
silent
in
the
last
thin
sunlight

in

hunted
in
agony--in
that
cold
green-clad
shadowed
porch

beyond--o
god
beyondâ€™
sheila
stood
listening
with
startled
eyes
â€˜and
was
all
that
in
quainâ€™
she
inquired
rather
flutteringly
lawford
turned
a
sidelong
head
and
looked
steadily
at
his
wife
she
shook
herself
with
a
slight
shiver
â€˜very
well
thenâ€™
she
said
and
paused
in
the
silence
her
husband
yawned
and
smiled
and
almost
as
if
lit
with
that
thin
last
sunshine
seemed
the
smile
that
passed
for
an
instant
across
the
reverie
of
his
shadowy
face
he
drew
a
hand
wearily
over
his
eyes
â€˜what
has
he
been
saying
nowâ€™
he
inquired
like
a
fretful
child
sheila
stood
very
quiet
and
still
as
if
in
fear
of
scaring
some
rare
wild
timid
creature
by
the
least
stir
â€˜whoâ€™
she
merely
breathed
lawford
paused
on
the
hearth-rug
with
his
comb
in
his
hand
â€˜itâ€™s
just
the
last
rags
of
that
beastly
influenzaâ€™
he
said
and
began
vigorously
combing
his
hair
and
yet
simple
and
frank
though
the
action
was
it
moved
sheila
perhaps
more
than
any
other
of
the
congested
occurrences
of
the
last
few
days
her
forehead
grew
suddenly
cold
the
palms
of
her
hands
began
to
ache
she
had
to
hasten
out
of
the
room
to
avoid
revealing
the
sheer
physical
repulsion
she
had
experienced
but
lawford
quite
unmindful
of
the
shock
continued
in
a
kind
of
heedless
reverie
to
watch
as
he
combed
the
still
visionary
thoughts
that
passed
in
tranced
stillness
before
his
eyes
he
longed
beyond
measure
for
freedom
that
until
yesterday
he
had
not
even
dreamed
existed
outside
the
covers
of
some
old
impossible
romance--the
magic
of
the
darkening
sky
the
invisible
flocking
presences
of
the
dead
the
shock
of
imaginations
that
had
no
words
of
quixotic
emotions
which
the
stranger
had
stirred
in
that
low
mocking
furtive
talk
beside
the
broken
stones
of
the
huguenot
was
the
â€˜changeâ€™
quite
so
monstrous
so
meaningless
how
often
indeed
he
remembered
curiously
had
he
seemed
to
be
standing
outside
these
fast-shut
gates
of
thought
that
now
had
been
freely
opened
to
him
he
drew
ajar
the
door
and
leant
his
ear
to
listen
from
far
away
came
a
rich
long-continued
chuckle
of
laughter
followed
by
the
clatter
of
a
falling
plate
and
then
still
more
uncontrollable
laughter
there
was
a
faint
smell
of
toast
on
the
air
lawford
ventured
out
on
to
the
landing
and
into
a
little
room
that
had
once
in
years
gone
by
been
aliceâ€™s
nursery
he
stood
far
back
from
the
strip
of
open
window
that
showed
beneath
the
green
blind
craning
forward
to
see
into
the
garden--the
trees
their
knotted
trunks
and
then
as
he
stole
nearer
a
flower-bed
late
roses
geraniums
calceolarias
the
lawn
and--yes
three
wicker
chairs
a
footstool
a
work-basket
a
little
table
on
the
smooth
grass
in
the
honey-coloured
sunshine
and
sheila
sitting
there
in
the
autumnal
sunlight
her
hands
resting
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
her
head
bent
evidently
deeply
engrossed
in
her
thoughts
he
crept
an
inch
or
two
forward
and
stooped
there
was
a
hat
on
the
grass--aliceâ€™s
big
garden
hat--and
beside
it
lay
flitters
nose
on
paws
long
ears
sagging
he
had
forgotten
flitters
had
flitters
forgotten
him
would
he
bark
at
the
strange
distasteful
scent
of
a--dr
ferguson
the
coast
was
clear
then
he
turned
even
softlier
yet
to
confront
rapt
still
and
hovering
betwixt
astonishment
and
dread
the
blue
calm
eyes
of
his
daughter
looking
in
at
the
door
it
seemed
to
lawford
as
if
they
had
both
been
suddenly
swept
by
some
unseen
power
into
a
still
unearthly
silence
â€˜we
thoughtâ€™
he
began
at
last
â€˜we
thought
just
to
beckon
mrs
lawford
from
the
window
he--he
is
asleepâ€™
alice
nodded
her
whole
face
was
in
a
moment
flooded
with
red
it
ebbed
and
left
her
pale
â€˜i
will
go
down
and
tell
mother
you
want
to
see
her
it
was
very
silly
of
me
i
did
not
quite
recognise
at
firsti
suppose
thinking
of
my
father--â€™
the
words
faltered
and
the
eyes
were
lifted
to
his
face
again
with
a
desolate
incredulous
appeal
lawford
turned
away
heartsick
and
trembling
â€˜certainly
certainly
by
no
meansâ€™
he
began
listening
vaguely
to
the
glib
patter
that
seemed
to
come
from
another
mouth
â€˜your
father
my
dear
young
lady
i
venture
to
think
is
now
really
on
the
road
to
recovery
dr
simon
makes
excellent
progress
but
of
course--two
heads
we
know
are
so
much
better
than
one
when
thereâ€™s
the
least--the
least
difficulty
the
great
thing
is
quiet
rest
isolation
no
possibility
of
a
shock
else--â€™
his
voice
fell
away
his
eloquence
failed
for
alice
stood
gazing
stirlessly
on
and
on
into
this
infinitely
strange
infinitely
familiar
shadowy
phantasmal
face
â€˜oh
yesâ€™
she
replied
â€˜i
quite
understand
of
course
but
if
i
might
just
peep
even
it
would--i
should
be
so
much
much
happier
do
let
me
just
see
him
dr
ferguson
if
only
his
head
on
the
pillow
i
wouldnâ€™t
even
breathe
couldnâ€™t
it
possibly
help--even
a
faith-cureâ€™
she
leant
forward
impulsively
her
voice
trembling
anal
her
eyes
still
shining
beneath
their
faint
melancholy
smile
â€˜i
fear
my
dearit
cannot
be
he
longs
to
see
you
but
with
his
mind
you
know
in
this
state
it
might--â€™
â€˜but
mother
never
told
meâ€™
broke
in
the
girl
desperately
â€˜there
was
anything
wrong
with
his
mind
oh
but
that
was
quite
unfair
you
donâ€™t
mean
you
donâ€™t
mean--that--â€™
lawford
scanned
swiftly
the
little
square
beloved
and
memoried
room
that
fate
had
suddenly
converted
for
him
into
a
cage
of
unspeakable
pain
and
longing
â€˜oh
no
believe
me
no
not
his
brain
not
that
not
even
wandering
really
but
always
thinking
always
longing
on
and
on
for
you
dear
only
quite
quite
master
of
himself
but--â€™
â€˜you
talkâ€™
she
broke
in
again
angrily
â€˜only
in
pretence
you
are
treating
me
like
a
child
and
so
does
mother
and
so
it
has
been
ever
since
i
came
home
why
if
mother
can
and
you
can
why
may
not
i
why
if
he
can
walk
and
talk
in
the
nightâ€™
â€˜but
who--who
â€œcan
walk
and
talk
in
the
nightâ€â€™
inquired
a
low
stealthy
voice
out
of
the
quietness
behind
her
alice
turned
swiftly
her
mother
was
standing
at
a
little
distance
with
all
the
calm
and
moveless
concentration
of
a
waxwork
figure
looking
up
at
her
from
the
staircase
â€˜i
was--i
was
talking
to
dr
ferguson
motherâ€™
â€˜but
as
i
came
up
the
stairs
i
understood
you
to
be
inquiring
something
of
dr
ferguson
â€œifâ€
you
were
saying
â€œhe
can
walk
and
talk
in
the
nightâ€
you
surely
were
not
referring
to
your
father
child
that
could
not
possibly
be
in
his
state
dr
ferguson
i
know
will
bear
me
out
in
that
at
least
and
besides
i
really
must
insist
on
following
out
medical
directions
to
the
letter
dr
ferguson
i
know
will
fully
concur
do
pray
dr
fergusonâ€™
continued
sheila
raising
her
voice
even
now
scarcely
above
a
rapid
murmur--â€˜do
pray
assure
my
daughter
that
she
must
have
patience
that
however
much
even
he
himself
may
desire
it
it
is
impossible
that
she
should
see
her
father
yet
and
now
my
dear
child
come
down
i
want
to
have
a
momentâ€™s
talk
with
dr
ferguson
i
feared
from
his
beckoning
at
the
window
that
something
was
amissâ€™
alice
turned
dismayed
and
looked
steadily
almost
with
hostility
at
the
stranger
so
curiously
transfixed
and
isolated
in
her
small
old
play-room
and
in
this
scornful
yet
pleading
confrontation
her
eye
fell
suddenly
on
the
pin
in
his
scarf--the
claw
and
the
pearl
she
had
known
all
her
life
from
that
her
gaze
flitted
like
some
wild
demented
thingâ€™s
over
face
hair
hands
clothes
attitude
expression
and
her
heart
stood
still
in
an
awful
inarticulate
dread
of
the
unknown
she
turned
slowly
towards
her
mother
groped
forward
a
few
steps
turned
once
more
stretching
out
her
hands
towards
the
vague
still
figure
whose
eyes
had
called
so
piteously
to
her
out
of
their
depths
and
fell
fainting
in
the
doorway
lawford
stood
motionless
vacantly
watching
sheila
who
knelt
chafing
the
cold
hands
â€˜she
has
faintedâ€™
he
said
â€˜oh
sheila
tell
me--only
faintedâ€™
sheila
made
no
answer
did
not
even
raise
her
eyes
â€˜some
day
sheilaâ€™
he
began
in
a
dull
voice
and
broke
off
and
without
another
word
without
even
another
glance
at
the
still
face
and
blue
twitching
lids
he
passed
her
rapidly
by
and
in
another
instant
sheila
heard
the
house-door
shut
she
got
up
quickly
and
after
a
glance
into
the
vacant
bedroom
turned
the
key
then
she
hastened
upstairs
for
sal
volatile
and
eau
de
cologne
it
was
yet
clear
daylight
when
lawford
appeared
beneath
the
portico
of
his
house
with
a
glance
of
circumspection
that
almost
seemed
to
suggest
a
fear
of
pursuit
he
descended
the
steps
only
to
be
made
aware
in
so
doing
that
ada
was
with
a
kind
of
furtive
eagerness
pointing
out
the
mysterious
dr
ferguson
to
a
steadily
gazing
cook
one
or
two
well-known
and
many
a
well-remembered
face
he
encountered
in
the
thin
stream
of
city
men
treading
blackly
along
the
pavement
it
was
a
still
high
evening
and
something
very
like
a
forlorn
compassion
rose
in
his
mind
at
sight
of
their
grave
rather
pretentious
rather
dull
respectable
faces
he
found
himself
walking
with
an
affectation
of
effrontery
and
smiling
with
a
faint
contempt
on
all
alike
as
if
to
keep
himself
from
slinking
and
the
wolf
out
of
his
eyes
he
felt
restless
and
watchful
and
suspicious
as
if
he
had
suddenly
come
down
in
the
world
his
then
was
a
disguise
as
effectual
as
a
shabby
coat
and
a
glazing
eye
his
heart
sickened
was
it
even
worth
while
living
on
a
crust
of
social
respectability
so
thin
and
so
exquisitely
treacherous
he
challenged
no
one
one
or
two
actual
acquaintances
raised
and
lowered
a
faintly
inquiring
eyebrow
in
his
direction
one
even
recalled
in
his
confusion
a
smile
of
recognition
just
a
moment
too
late
there
was
it
seemed
a
peculiar
aura
in
lawfordâ€™s
presence
a
shadow
of
a
something
in
his
demeanour
that
proved
him
alien
none
the
less
green
widderstone
kept
calling
him
much
as
a
bell
in
the
imagination
tolls
on
and
on
the
echo
of
reality
if
the
worst
should
come
to
the
worst
why--there
is
pasture
in
the
solitary
by-ways
for
the
beast
that
strays
he
quickened
his
pace
along
lonelier
streets
and
soon
strode
freely
through
the
little
flagged
and
cobbled
village
of
shops
past
the
same
small
jutting
window
whose
clock
had
told
him
the
hour
on
that
first
dark
hurried
night
all
was
pale
and
faint
with
dying
colours
now
and
decay
was
in
the
leaf
and
the
last
swallows
filled
the
gold
air
with
their
clashing
stillness
no
one
heeded
him
here
he
looked
from
side
to
side
exulting
in
the
strangeness
shops
were
left
behind
the
last
milestone
passed
and
in
a
little
while
he
was
descending
the
hill
beneath
the
elm
boughs
which
he
remembered
had
stood
like
a
turreted
wall
against
the
sunset
when
first
he
had
wandered
down
into
the
churchyard
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
he
passed
by
the
green
and
white
rectory
and
there
was
the
parson
a
short
fat
pursy
man
with
wrists
protruding
from
his
jacket
sleeves
as
he
stood
on
tip-toe
tying
up
a
rambling
rose-shoot
on
his
trim
cedared
lawn
the
next
house
barely
showed
its
old
red
chimney-tops
above
its
bowers
the
next
was
empty
with
windows
vacantly
gazing
its
paths
peopled
with
great
bearded
weeds
that
stood
mutely
watching
and
guarding
the
seldom-opened
gate
then
came
more
lofty
grandmotherly
elms
a
dense
hedge
of
every
leaf
that
pricks
and
then
lawford
found
himself
standing
at
the
small
canopied
gate
of
the
queer
old
wooden
house
that
the
stranger
of
his
talk
had
in
part
described
it
stood
square
and
high
and
dark
in
a
small
amphitheatre
of
verdure
roses
here
and
there
sprang
from
the
grass
and
a
narrow
box-edged
path
led
to
a
small
door
in
a
low
green-mantled
wing
with
its
one
square
window
above
the
porch
and
while
with
vacant
mind
lawford
stood
waiting
as
one
stands
forebodingly
upon
the
eve
of
a
new
experience
he
heard
as
if
at
a
distance
the
sound
of
falling
water
he
still
paused
on
the
country
roadside
scrutinising
this
strange
still
wooden
presence
but
at
last
with
an
effort
he
pushed
open
the
gate
followed
the
winding
path
and
pulled
the
old
iron
hanging
bell
there
came
presently
a
quiet
tread
and
herbert
himself
opened
the
door
which
led
into
a
little
square
wood-panelled
hall
hung
with
queer
old
prints
and
obscure
portraits
in
dark
frames
â€˜ah
yes
come
in
mr
lawfordâ€™
he
drawled
â€˜i
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
you
were
not
comingâ€™
lawford
laid
hat
and
walking-stick
on
an
oak
bench
and
followed
his
churchyard
companion
up
a
slightly
inclined
corridor
and
a
staircase
into
a
high
room
covered
far
up
the
yellowish
walls
with
old
books
on
shelves
and
in
cases
between
which
hung
in
little
black
frames
mezzo
tints
etchings
and
antiquated
maps
a
large
table
stood
a
few
paces
from
the
deep
alcove
of
the
window
which
was
surrounded
by
a
low
faded
green
seat
and
was
screened
from
the
sunshine
by
wooden
shutters
and
here
the
tranquil
surge
of
falling
water
shook
incessantly
on
the
air
for
the
three
lower
casements
stood
open
to
the
fading
sunset
on
a
smaller
table
were
spread
cups
old
earthenware
dishes
of
fruit
and
a
big
bowl
of
damask
roses
â€˜please
sit
down
i
shanâ€™t
be
a
moment
i
am
not
sure
that
my
sister
is
in
but
if
so
i
will
tell
her
we
are
ready
for
teaâ€™
left
to
himself
in
this
quiet
strange
old
room
lawford
forgot
for
a
while
everything
else
he
was
for
the
moment
so
taken
up
with
his
surroundings
what
seized
on
his
fancy
and
strangely
affected
his
mind
was
this
incessant
changing
roar
of
falling
water
it
must
be
the
widder
he
said
to
himself
flowing
close
to
the
walls
but
not
until
he
had
had
the
boldness
to
lean
head
and
shoulders
out
of
the
nearest
window
did
he
fully
realize
how
close
indeed
the
widder
was
it
came
sweeping
dark
and
deep
and
begreened
and
full
with
the
early
autumnal
rains
actually
against
the
lower
walls
of
the
house
itself
and
in
the
middle
suddenly
swerved
in
a
black
smooth
arch
and
tumbled
headlong
into
a
great
pool
nodding
with
tall
slender
water-weeds
and
charged
in
its
bubbled
blackness
here
and
there
with
the
last
crimson
of
the
setting
sun
to
the
left
of
the
house
where
the
waters
floated
free
again
stood
vast
still
trees
above
the
clustering
rushes
and
in
glimpses
between
their
spreading
boughs
lay
the
far-stretching
countryside
now
dimmed
with
the
first
mists
of
approaching
evening
so
absorbed
he
became
as
he
stood
leaning
over
the
wooden
sill
above
the
falling
water
that
eye
and
ear
became
enslaved
by
the
roar
and
stillness
and
in
the
faint
atmosphere
of
age
that
seemed
like
a
veil
to
hang
about
the
odd
old
house
and
these
prodigious
branches
he
fell
into
a
kind
of
waking
dream
when
at
last
he
did
draw
back
into
the
room
it
was
perceptibly
darker
and
a
thin
keen
shaft
of
recollection
struck
across
his
mind--the
recollection
of
what
he
was
and
of
how
he
came
to
be
there
his
reasons
for
coming
and
of
that
dark
indefinable
presence
which
like
a
raven
had
begun
to
build
its
dwelling
in
his
mind
he
sat
on
his
eyes
restlessly
wandering
his
face
leaning
on
his
hands
and
in
a
while
the
door
opened
and
herbert
returned
carrying
an
old
crimson
and
green
teapot
and
a
dish
of
hot
cakes
â€˜theyâ€™re
all
outâ€™
he
said
â€˜sister
sallie
and
boy
but
these
were
in
the
oven
so
we
wonâ€™t
wait
i
hope
you
havenâ€™t
been
very
much
boredâ€™
lawford
dropped
his
hands
from
his
face
and
smiled
â€˜i
have
been
looking
at
the
waterâ€™
he
said
â€˜my
sisterâ€™s
favorite
occupation
she
sits
for
hours
and
hours
with
not
even
a
book
for
an
apology
staring
down
into
the
black
old
roaring
pot
it
has
a
sort
of
hypnotic
effect
after
a
time
and
youâ€™d
be
surprised
how
quickly
one
gets
used
to
the
noise
to
me
itâ€™s
even
less
distracting
than
sheer
silence
you
donâ€™t
know
after
all
what
on
earth
sheer
silence
means--even
at
widderstone
but
one
can
just
realize
a
water-nymph
they
chatter
but
thank
heaven
itâ€™s
not
articulateâ€™
he
handed
lawford
a
cup
with
a
certain
niceness
and
self-consciousness
lifting
his
eyebrows
slightly
as
he
turned
lawford
found
himself
listening
out
of
a
peculiar
stillness
of
mind
to
the
voice
of
this
suave
and
rather
inscrutable
acquaintance
â€˜the
curious
thing
is
do
you
knowâ€™
he
began
rather
nervously
â€˜that
though
i
must
have
passed
your
gate
at
least
twice
in
the
last
few
months
i
have
never
noticed
it
before
never
even
caught
the
sound
of
the
waterâ€™
â€˜no
thatâ€™s
the
best
of
it
nobody
ever
does
we
are
just
buried
alive
we
have
lived
here
for
years
and
scarcely
know
a
soul--not
even
our
own
perhaps
why
on
earth
should
one
acquaintances
after
all
are
little
else
than
a
bad
habitâ€™
â€˜but
then
what
about
meâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜but
thatâ€™s
just
itâ€™
said
herbert
â€˜i
said
acquaintances
thatâ€™s
just
exactly
what
iâ€™m
going
to
prove--what
very
old
friends
we
are
youâ€™ve
no
idea
it
really
is
rather
queerâ€™
he
took
up
his
cup
and
sauntered
over
to
the
window
lawford
eyed
him
vacantly
for
a
moment
and
following
rather
his
own
curious
thoughts
than
seeking
any
light
on
this
somewhat
vague
explanation
again
broke
the
silence
â€˜itâ€™s
odd
i
suppose
but
this
house
affects
me
much
in
the
same
way
as
widderstone
does
iâ€™m
not
particularly
fanciful--at
least
i
used
not
to
be
but
sitting
here
i
seem
i
hope
it
isnâ€™t
a
very
frantic
remark
it
seems
as
though
if
only
my
ears
would
let
me
i
should
hear--well
voices
itâ€™s
just
what
you
said
about
the
silence
i
suppose
itâ€™s
the
age
of
the
place
it
is
very
oldâ€™
â€˜pretty
old
i
suppose
itâ€™s
worm-eaten
and
rat-eaten
and
tindery
enough
in
all
conscience
and
the
damp
doesnâ€™t
exactly
foster
it
itâ€™s
a
queer
old
shanty
there
are
two
or
three
accounts
of
it
in
some
old
local
stuff
i
have
and
of
course
thereâ€™s
a
ghostâ€™
â€˜a
ghostâ€™
echoed
lawford
looking
up
whatâ€™s
in
a
nameâ€™
laughed
herbert
â€˜but
it
really
is
a
queer
show-up
of
human
oddity
a
fellow
comes
in
here
searching
thatâ€™s
allâ€™
his
back
was
turned
as
he
stood
staring
absently
out
sipping
his
tea
between
his
sentences
â€˜he
comes
in--oh
itâ€™s
a
positive
fact
for
iâ€™ve
seen
him
myself
just
sitting
back
in
my
chair
here
you
know
watching
him
as
one
would
a
tramp
in
oneâ€™s
orchardâ€™
he
cast
a
candid
glance
over
his
shoulder
â€˜first
he
looks
round
like
a
prying
servant
then
he
comes
cautiously
on--a
kind
of
grizzled
fawn-coloured
face
middle-size
with
big
hands
and
then
just
like
some
quiet
groping
nocturnal
creature
he
begins
his
precious
search--shelves
drawers
that
are
not
here
cupboards
gone
years
ago
questing
and
nosing
no
end
and
quite
methodically
too
until
he
reaches
the
window
then
he
stops
looks
back
narrows
his
foxy
lids
listens--quite
perceptibly
you
know
a
kind
of
gingerish
blur
then
he
seems
to
open
this
corner
bookcase
here
as
if
it
were
a
door
and
goes
out
along
what
i
suppose
might
at
some
time
have
been
an
outside
gallery
or
balcony
unless
as
i
rather
fancy
the
house
extended
once
beyond
these
windows
anyhow
out
he
goes
quite
deliberately
treading
the
air
as
lightly
as
botticelliâ€™s
angels
until
however
far
you
lean
out
of
the
window
you
canâ€™t
follow
him
any
further
and
then--and
this
is
the
bit
that
takes
oneâ€™s
fancy--when
you
have
contentedly
noddled
down
again
to
whatever
you
may
have
been
doing
when
the
wretch
appeared
or
are
sitting
in
a
cold
sweat
with
bolting
eyes
awaiting
developments
just
according
to
your
school
of
thought
or
of
nerves
the
creature
comes
back--comes
back
and
with
what
looks
uncommonly
like
a
lighted
candle
in
his
hand
that
really
is
a
thrill
i
assure
youâ€™
â€˜but
youâ€™ve
seen
this--youâ€™ve
really
seen
this
yourselfâ€™
â€˜oh
yes
twiceâ€™
replied
herbert
cheerfully
â€˜and
my
sister
quite
by
haphazard
once
saw
him
from
the
garden
she
was
shelling
peas
one
evening
for
sallie
and
she
distinctly
saw
him
shamble
out
of
the
window
here
and
go
shuffling
along
mid-air
across
the
roaring
washpot
down
below
turn
sharp
round
the
high
corner
of
the
house
sheer
against
the
stars
in
a
kind
of
frightened
hurry
and
then
after
five
minutesâ€™
concentrated
watching
over
the
shucks
she
saw
him
come
shuffling
back
again--the
same
distraction
the
same
nebulous
snuff
colour
and
a
candle
trailing
its
smoke
behind
him
as
he
whisked
in
homeâ€™
â€˜and
thenâ€™
â€˜ah
thenâ€™
said
herbert
lagging
along
the
bookshelves
and
scanning
the
book-backs
with
eyes
partially
closed
he
turned
with
lifted
teapot
and
refilled
his
visitorâ€™s
cup
â€˜then
wherever
you
are--i
meanâ€™
he
added
cutting
up
a
little
cake
into
six
neat
slices
â€˜wherever
the
chance
inmate
of
the
room
happens
to
be
he
comes
straight
for
you
at
a
quite
alarming
velocity
and
fades
vanishes
melts
or
as
it
were
silts
insideâ€™
lawford
listened
in
a
curious
hush
that
had
suddenly
fallen
over
his
mind
â€˜â€œfades
inside
siltsâ€--iâ€™m
awfully
stupid
but
what
on
earth
do
you
meanâ€™
the
room
had
slowly
emptied
itself
of
daylight
its
own
darkness
it
seemed
had
met
that
of
the
narrowing
night
and
herbert
deliberately
lit
a
cigarette
before
replying
his
clear
pale
face
with
its
smooth
outline
and
thin
mouth
and
rather
long
dark
eyes
turned
with
a
kind
of
serene
good-humour
towards
his
questioner
â€˜whyâ€™
he
said
â€˜i
mean
frankly
just
that
besides
itâ€™s
griselâ€™s
own
phrase
and
an
old
nurse
we
used
to
have
said
much
the
same
he
comes
or
it
comes
towards
you
first
just
walking
then
with
a
kind
of
gradually
accelerated
slide
or
glide
and
sweeps
straight
into
youâ€™
he
tapped
his
chest
â€˜me
whoever
it
may
be
is
here
in
a
kind
of
panic
i
suppose
to
hide
or
perhaps
simply
to
get
back
againâ€™
â€˜get
back
whereâ€™
â€˜be
resumed
as
it
were
via
you
you
see
i
suppose
he
is
compelled
to
regain
his
circle
or
purgatory
or
styx
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
via
consciousness
no
one
present
then
no
revenant
or
spook
or
astral
body
or
hallucination
whatâ€™s
in
a
name
and
of
course
even
an
hallucination
is
mind-stuff
and
on
its
own
as
it
were
what
i
mean
is
that
the
poor
devil
must
have
some
kind
of
human
personality
to
get
back
through
in
order
to
make
his
exit
from
our
sphere
of
consciousness
into
his
and
naturally
of
course
to
make
his
entrance
too
if
like
a
tenuous
smoke
he
can
get
in
the
probability
is
that
he
gets
out
in
precisely
the
same
fashion
for
really
if
you
werenâ€™t
consciously
expecting
the
customary
impact
you
actually
jerk
forward
in
the
act
of
resistance
unresisted
you
would
not
notice
his
going
i
am
afraid
i
must
be
horribly
boring
you
with
all
these
tangled
theories
all
i
mean
is
that
if
you
were
really
absorbed
in
what
you
happened
to
be
doing
at
the
time
the
thing
might
come
and
go
with
your
mind
for
entrance
and
exit
as
it
were
without
your
being
conscious
of
it
at
allâ€™
there
was
a
longish
pause
in
which
herbert
slowly
inhaled
and
softly
breathed
out
his
smoke
â€˜and
what--what
is
the
poor
wretch
searching
for
and
what--why
what
becomes
of
him
when
he
does
goâ€™
â€˜ah
there
you
have
me
one
merely
surmises
just
as
oneâ€™s
temperament
or
convictions
lean
grisel
says
itâ€™s
some
poor
derelict
soul
in
search
of
peace--that
the
poor
beggar
wants
finally
to
die
in
fact
and
canâ€™t
sallie
smells
crime
after
all
what
is
every
manâ€™
he
talked
on
â€˜a
horde
of
ghosts--like
a
chinese
nest
of
boxes--oaks
that
were
acorns
that
were
oaks
death
lies
behind
us
not
in
front--in
our
ancestors
back
and
back
until--â€™
â€˜â€œuntilâ€â€™
lawford
managed
to
remark
â€˜ah
that
settles
me
again
donâ€™t
they
call
it
an
amoeba
but
really
i
am
abjectly
ignorant
of
all
that
kind
of
stuff
we
are
all
we
are
and
all
in
a
sense
we
care
to
dream
we
are
and
for
that
matter
anything
outlandish
bizarre
is
a
godsend
in
this
rather
stodgy
life
it
is
after
all
just
what
the
old
boy
said--itâ€™s
only
the
impossible
thatâ€™s
credible
whatever
credible
may
meanâ€™
it
seemed
to
lawford
as
if
the
last
remark
had
wafted
him
bodily
into
the
presence
of
his
kind
blinking
intensely
anxious
old
friend
mr
bethany
and
what
leagues
asunder
the
two
men
were
who
had
happened
on
much
the
same
words
to
express
their
convictions
he
drew
his
hand
gropingly
over
his
face
half
rose
and
again
seated
himself
â€˜whatever
it
may
beâ€™
he
said
â€˜the
whole
thing
reminds
me
you
know--it
is
in
a
way
so
curiously
like
my
own--my
own
caseâ€™
herbert
sat
on
a
little
drawn
up
in
his
chair
quietly
smoking
the
crash
of
the
falling
water
after
seeming
to
increase
in
volume
with
the
fading
of
evening
had
again
died
down
in
the
darkness
to
a
low
multitudinous
tumult
as
of
countless
inarticulate
echoing
voices
â€˜â€œbizarreâ€
you
said
god
knows
i
amâ€™
but
herbert
still
remained
obdurately
silent
â€˜you
remember
perhapsâ€™
lawford
faintly
began
again
â€˜our
talk
the
other
nightâ€™
â€˜oh
ratherâ€™
replied
the
cordial
voice
out
of
the
dusk
â€˜i
suppose
you
thought
i
was
insaneâ€™
â€˜insaneâ€™
there
was
a
genuinely
amused
astonishment
in
the
echo
â€˜you
were
lucidity
itself
besides--well
honestly
if
i
may
venture
i
donâ€™t
put
very
much
truck
in
what
one
calls
oneâ€™s
sanity
except
of
course
as
a
bond
of
respectability
and
a
means
of
livelihoodâ€™
â€˜but
did
you
realise
in
the
least
from
what
i
said
how
i
really
stand
that
i
went
down
into
that
old
shadowy
hollow
one
man
and
came
back--well--thisâ€™
â€˜i
gathered
vaguely
something
like
that
i
thought
at
first
it
was
merely
an
affectation--that
what
you
said
was
an
affectation
i
mean--until--well
to
be
frank
it
was
the
â€œthisâ€
that
so
immensely
interested
me
especiallyâ€™
he
added
almost
with
a
touch
of
gaiety
â€˜especially
the
last
glimpse
but
if
itâ€™s
really
not
a
forbidden
question
what
precisely
was
the
other
what
precise
manner
of
man
i
mean
came
down
into
widderstoneâ€™
â€˜it
is
my
face
that
is
changed
mr
herbert
if
youâ€™ll
try
to
understand
me--my
face
what
you
see
now
is
not
what
i
really
am
not
what
i
was
oh
it
is
all
quite
different
i
know
perfectly
well
how
absurd
it
must
sound
and
you
wonâ€™t
press
me
further
but
thatâ€™s
the
truth
thatâ€™s
what
they
have
done
for
meâ€™
it
seemed
to
lawford
as
if
a
remote
tiny
shout
of
laughter
had
been
suddenly
caught
back
in
the
silence
that
had
followed
this
confession
he
peered
in
vain
in
the
direction
of
his
companion
even
his
cigarette
revealed
no
sign
of
him
â€˜i
know
i
knowâ€™
he
went
gropingly
on
â€˜i
felt
it
would
sound
to
you
like
nothing
but
frantic
incredible
nonsense
you
canâ€™t
see
it
you
canâ€™t
feel
it
you
canâ€™t
hear
these
hooting
voices
itâ€™s
no
use
at
all
blinking
the
fact
i
am
simply
on
the
verge
if
not
over
it
of
insanityâ€™
â€˜as
to
that
mr
lawfordâ€™
came
the
still
voice
out
of
the
darkness
â€˜the
very
fact
of
your
being
able
to
say
so
seems
to
me
all
but
proof
positive
that
youâ€™re
not
insanity
is
on
another
plane
isnâ€™t
it
in
which
one
canâ€™t
compare
oneâ€™s
states
as
for
what
you
say
being
credible
take
our
precious
noodle
of
a
spook
here
ninety-nine
hundredths
of
this
amiable
world
of
ours
would
have
guffawed
the
poor
creature
into
imperceptibility
ages
ago
to
such
poor
credulous
creatures
as
my
sister
and
i
he
is
no
more
and
no
less
a
fact
a
personality
an
amusing
reality
than--well
this
teacup
here
we
are
amazing
mysteries
both
of
us
in
any
case
and
all
round
us
are
scores
of
books
dealing
just
with
life
pure
candid
and
unexpurgated
and
thereâ€™s
not
a
single
one
among
them
but
reads
like
a
taradiddle
yet
grope
between
the
lines
of
any
autobiography
itâ€™s
pretty
clear
what
one
has
got--a
feeble
timid
creeping
attempt
to
describe
the
indescribable
as
for
what
you
say
your
case
is
the
bizarre--that
kind
very
seldom
gets
into
print
at
all
in
all
our
make-believe
all
our
pretence
how
honestly
could
it
but
there
this
is
immaterial
the
real
question
is
may
i
can
i
help
what
i
gather
is
this
you
just
trundled
down
into
widderstone
all
among
the
dead
men
and--but
one
moment
iâ€™ll
light
upâ€™
a
light
flickered
up
in
the
dark
shading
it
in
his
hand
from
the
night
air
straying
through
the
open
window
herbert
lit
the
two
candles
that
stood
upon
the
little
chimneypiece
behind
lawfordâ€™s
head
then
sauntering
over
to
the
window
again
almost
as
if
with
an
affectation
of
nonchalance
he
drew
one
of
the
shutters
and
sat
down
â€˜nothing
much
struck
meâ€™
he
went
on
leaning
back
on
his
hands
â€˜i
mean
on
sunday
evening
until
you
said
good-bye
it
was
then
that
i
caught
in
the
moon
a
distinct
glimpse
of
your
faceâ€™
â€˜thisâ€™
said
lawford
with
a
sudden
horrible
sinking
of
the
heart
herbert
nodded
â€˜the
fact
is
i
have
a
print
of
itâ€™
he
said
â€˜a
print
of
itâ€™
â€˜a
miserable
little
dingy
engravingâ€™
â€˜of
thisâ€™
herbert
nodded
with
eyes
fixed
â€˜whereâ€™
â€˜thatâ€™s
the
nuisance
i
searched
high
and
low
for
it
the
instant
i
got
home
for
the
moment
it
has
been
mislaid
but
it
must
be
somewhere
in
the
house
and
it
will
turn
up
all
in
good
time
itâ€™s
the
frontispiece
of
one
of
a
queer
old
hotchpotch
of
pamphlets
sewn
up
together
by
some
amateur
enthusiast
in
a
marbled
paper
cover--confessions
travels
trials
and
so
on
all
eighteenth
century
and
all
in
frenchâ€™
â€˜and
mineâ€™
said
lawford
gazing
stonily
across
the
candlelight
herbert
from
a
head
slightly
stooping
gazed
back
in
an
almost
birdlike
fashion
across
the
room
at
his
visitor
â€˜sabathierâ€™sâ€™
he
said
â€˜sabathierâ€™sâ€™
â€˜a
really
curious
resemblance
of
course
i
am
speaking
only
from
memory
and
perhaps
itâ€™s
not
quite
so
vivid
in
this
light
but
still
astonishingly
clearâ€™
lawford
sat
drawn
up
staring
at
his
companionâ€™s
face
in
an
intense
and
helpless
silence
his
mouth
opened
but
no
words
came
â€˜of
courseâ€™
began
herbert
again
â€˜i
donâ€™t
say
thereâ€™s
anything
in
it--except
the--the
mere
coincidenceâ€™
he
paused
and
glanced
out
of
the
open
casement
beside
him
â€˜but
thereâ€™s
just
one
obvious
question
do
you
happen
to
know
of
any
strain
of
french
blood
in
your
familyâ€™
lawford
shut
his
eyes
even
memory
seemed
to
be
forsaking
him
at
last
â€˜noâ€™
he
said
after
a
long
pause
â€˜thereâ€™s
a
little
dutch
i
think
on
my
motherâ€™s
side
but
no
frenchâ€™
â€˜no
sabathier
thenâ€™
said
herbert
smiling
â€˜and
then
thereâ€™s
another
question--this
change
is
it
really
as
complete
as
you
suppose
has
it--please
just
warn
me
off
if
i
am
in
the
least
intruding--has
it
been
noticedâ€™
lawford
hesitated
â€˜oh
yesâ€™
he
said
slowly
â€˜it
has
been
noticed--my
wife
a
few
friendsâ€™
â€˜do
you
mind
this
infernal
clatterâ€™
said
herbert
laying
his
fingers
on
the
open
casement
â€˜no
no
and
you
thinkâ€™
â€˜my
dear
fellow
i
donâ€™t
think
anything

all
the
craziest
conjecture
stranger
things
even
than
this

happened
there
are
dozens
here--in
print
what
are
we
human
beings
after
all
clay
in
the
hands
of
the
potter
our
bodies
are
merely
an
inheritance
packed
tight
and
corded
up
we
have
practically
no
control
over
their
main
functions
we
canâ€™t
even
replace
a
little
finger-nail
and
look
at
the
faces
of
us--what
atrocious
mockeries
most
of
them
are
of
any
kind
of
image
but
we
know
our
bodies
change--age
sickness
thought
passion
fatality
it
proves
they
are
amazingly
plastic
and
merely
even
as
a
theory
it
is
not
in
the
least
untenable
that
by
force
of
some
violent
convulsive
effort
from
outside
oneâ€™s
body
might
change

with
odd
voluntariness
to
friend
or
foe
smile
or
snarl
as
for
what
we
call
the
laws

are
pure

he
smoked
on
in
silence
for
a
moment
â€˜you
say
you
fell
asleep
down
thereâ€™
lawford
nodded
herbert
tapped
his
cigarette
on
the
sill
â€˜just
following
up
our
ludicrous
conjecture
you
knowâ€™
he
remarked
musingly
â€˜it
wasnâ€™t
such
a
bad
opportunity
for
the
poor
chapâ€™
â€˜but
surelyâ€™
said
lawford
speaking
as
it
were
out
of
a
dream
of
candle-light
and
reverberating
sound
and
clearest
darkness
towards
this
strange
deliberate
phantom
with
the
unruffled
clear-cut
features--â€˜surely
then
in
that
case
he
is
here
now
and
yet
on
my
word
of
honour
though
every
friend
i
ever
had
in
the
world
should
deny
it
i
am
the
same
memory
stretches
back
clear
and
sound
to
my
childhood
i
can
see
myself
with
extraordinary
lucidity
how
i
think
my
motives
and
all
that
and
in
spite
of
these
voices
that
i
seem
to
hear
and
this
peculiar
kind
of
longing
to
break
away
as
it
were
just
to
press
on--it
is
i--i
myself
that
am
speaking
to
you
now
out
of
this--this
maskâ€™
herbert
glanced
reflectively
at
his
companion
â€˜you
mustnâ€™t
let
me
tire
youâ€™
he
said
â€˜but
even
on
our
theory
it
would
not
necessarily
follow
that
you
yourself
would
be
much
affected
itâ€™s
true
this
fellow
sabathier
really
was
something
of
a
personality
he
had
a
rather
unusual
itch
for
life
for
trying
on
and
on
to
squeeze
something
out
of
experience
that
isnâ€™t
there
and
he
seemed
never
to
weary
of
a
magnificent
attempt
to
find
in
his
fellow-creatures
especially
in
the
women
he
met
what
even--if
they
have
it--they
cannot
give
the
little
book
i
wanted
to
show
you
is
partly
autobiographical
and
really
does
manage
to
set
the
fellow
on
his
feet
even
there
he
does
absolutely
take
oneâ€™s
imagination
i
shall
never
forget
the
thrill
of
picking
him
up
in
the
charing
cross
road
you
see
i
had
known
the
queer
old
tombstone
for
years
heâ€™s
enormously
vivid--quite
beyond
my
feebleness
to
describe
with
a
kind
of
french
verve
and
rapture
unluckily
we
canâ€™t
get
nearer
than
two
years
to
his
death
i
shouldnâ€™t
mind
guessing
some
last
devastating
dream
swept
over
him
held
him
the
breath
of
an
instant
too
long
beneath
the
wave
and
he
caved
in
we
know
he
killed
himself
and
perhaps
lived
to
regret
it
ever
after
â€˜after
all
what
is
this
precious
dying
we
talk
so
much
aboutâ€™
herbert
continued
after
a
while
his
eyes
restlessly
wandering
from
shelf
to
shelf
â€˜you
remember
our
talk
in
the
churchyard

all
know

fades
quick
enough
when
its
occupant
is
gone

even
in
the
sleep
of
the
living
it
lies
very
feebly
guarded
and
supposing
in
that
state
some
infernally
potent
thing
outside
it
wandering
disembodied
just
happens
on
it--like
some
hungry
sexton
beetle
on
the
carcase
of
a
mouse

the
most
outrageous
theorising--but
supposing
all
these
years
of
sun
and
dark

emanation
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
horribly
restless
by
some
fatality
longing
on
and
on
just
for
life
or
even
for
the
face
the
voice
of
some
â€œimpossible
sheâ€
whom
he
couldnâ€™t
get
in
this
muddled
world
simply
loathing
all

has
been
lingering
in
ambush
down
beside
those
poor
old
dusty
bones

had
poured
out
for
him
such
marrowy
hospitality--oh
i

dead
do

then
by
a
chance
one
quiet
autumn
evening
a
veritable
godsend
of
a
little
miss
muffet
comes
wandering
down
under
the
shade
of
his
immortal
cypresses
half
asleep
fagged
out
depressed
in
mind
and
body

yourself
in

herbert
stood
up
in
his
eagerness
his
sleek
hair
shining
â€˜the
one

raid
i
can
just
conceive
it--the
amazing
struggle
in
that
darkness
within
a
darkness
like
some
dazed
alien
bee
bursting
through
the
sentinels
of
a
hive
one
mad
impetuous
clutch
at
victory
then
the
appalling
stirring
on
the

side
the
groping
back

dismantled

you
disorganised

disintegratedâ€™
he
broke
off
with
a
smile
as
if
of
apology
for
his
long
fantastic
harangue
lawford
sat
listening
his
eyes
fixed
on
herbertâ€™s
colourless
face
there
was
not
a
sound
else
it
seemed
than
that
slightly
drawling
scrupulous
voice
poking
its
way
amid
a
maze
of
enticing
baffling
thoughts
herbert
turned
away
with
a
shrug
â€˜itâ€™s
tempting
stuffâ€™
he
said
choosing
another
cigarette
â€˜but
anyhow
the
poor
beggar
failedâ€™
â€˜failedâ€™
â€˜why
surely
if
he
had
succeeded

should
not
now

talking

a
mere
imperfect
simulacrum
to
the
outward
illusion
of
a
passing
likeness
to
the
man
but
to
sabathier
himselfâ€™
his
eyes
moved
slowly
round
and
dwelt
for
a
moment
with
a
dark
quiet
scrutiny
on
his
visitor
â€˜you
say
a
passing
likeness
do
you
mean
thatâ€™
herbert
smiled
indulgently
â€˜if
one
can
mean
what
is
purely
a
speculation
i
am
only
trying
to
look
at
the
thing
dispassionately
you
see
we
are
so
much
the
slaves
of
mere
repetition
here
is
life--yours
and
mine--a
kind
of
plenum
in
vacuo
it
is
only
when
we
begin
to
play
the
eavesdropper
when
something
goes
askew
when
one
of
the
sentries
on
the
frontier
of
the
unexpected
shouts
a
hoarse
â€œqui
viveâ€--it
is
only
then
we
begin
to
question
to
prick
our
aldermen
and
pinch
the
calves
of
our
kings
why
who
is
there
can
answer
to
anybodyâ€™s
but
his
own
satisfaction
just
that
one
fundamental
question--are
we
the
prisoners
the
slaves
the
inheritors
the
creatures
or
the
creators
of
our
bodies
fallen
angels
or
horrific
dust

for
identity
or
likeness
or
personality

have
only
our
neighboursâ€™
nod
for
them
and
just
a
fading
memory
no
the
old
fairy
tales
knew
better
and
witchcraftâ€™s
witchcraft
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
honestly
and
just
of
course
on
that
one
theory
lawford
i
canâ€™t
help
thinking
that
sabathierâ€™s
raid
only
just
so
far
succeeded
as
to
leave
his
impression
in
the
wax
it
doesnâ€™t
of
course
follow
that
it
will
necessarily
end
there
it
might--it
may
be
even
now

gradually
fading
away

you
know
need
driving
out--with
whips
and
scorpions

might
perhaps
work
inâ€™
lawford
sat
cold
and
still
â€˜itâ€™s
no
good
no
goodâ€™
he
said
â€˜i
donâ€™t
understand
i
canâ€™t
follow
you
i
was
always
stupid
always
bigoted
and
cocksure
these
things
have
never
seemed
anything
but
old
womenâ€™s
tales
to
me
and
now
i
must
pay
for
it
and
this
nicholas
sabathier
you
say
he
was
a
blackguardâ€™
â€˜wellâ€™
said
herbert
with
a
faint
smile
â€˜that
depends
on
your
definition
of
the
word
he
wasnâ€™t
a
flunkey
a
fool
or
a
prig
if
thatâ€™s
what
you
mean
he
wasnâ€™t
perhaps
on
mrs
grundyâ€™s
visiting
list
he
wasnâ€™t
exactly
gregarious
and
yet
in
a
sense
that
kind
of
temperament
is
so
rare
that
sappho
nelson
and
shelley
shared
it
to
the
stodgy
suety
world
of
course
itâ€™s
little
else
than
sheer
moonshine
midsummer
madness
naturally
in
its
own
charming
and
stodgy
way
the
world
kept
flickering
cold
water
in
his
direction
naturally
it
hissed
i
shall
find
the
book
you
shall
have
the
book
oh
yesâ€™
â€˜thereâ€™s
only
one
more
questionâ€™
said
lawford
in
a
dull
slow
voice
stooping
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
â€˜i
know
itâ€™s
impossible
for
you
to
realise--but
to
me
time
seems
like
that
water
there
to
be
heaping
up
about
me
i
wait
just
as
one
waits
when
the
conductor
of
an
orchestra
lifts
his
hand
and
in
a
moment
the
whole
surge
of
brass
and
wood
cymbal
and
drum
will
crash
out--and
sweep
me
under
i
canâ€™t
tell
you
herbert
how
it
all
is
with
just
these
groping
stirrings
of
that
mole
in
my
mindâ€™s
dark
you
say
it
may
be
this
face
working
in
god
knows
i
find
it
easy
to
speak
to
you--this
cold
clear
sense
you
know
the
others
feel
too
much
or
are
afraid
or--let
me
think--yes
i
was
going
to
ask
you
a
question
but
no
one
can
answer
itâ€™
he
peered
darkly
with
white
face
suddenly
revealed
between
his
hands
â€˜what
remains
now
where
do
i
come
in
what
is
there
left
for
me
to
doâ€™
and
at
that
moment
there
sounded
even
above
the
monotonous
roar
of
the
water
beyond
the
window--there
fell
the
sound
of
a
light
footfall
approaching
along
the
corridor
â€˜listenâ€™
said
herbert
â€˜hereâ€™s
my
sister
coming
weâ€™ll
ask
herâ€™
the
door
opened
lawford
rose
and
into
the
further
rays
of
the
candlelight
entered
a
rather
slim
figure
in
a
light
summer
gown
â€˜just
homeâ€™
said
herbert
â€˜weâ€™ve
been
for
a
walk--â€™
â€˜my
sister
always
forgets
everythingâ€™
said
herbert
turning
to
lawford
â€˜even
tea-time
this
is
mr
lawford
grisel
weâ€™ve
been
arguing
no
end
and
we
want
you
to
give
a
decision
itâ€™s
just
this
supposing
if
by
some
impossible
trick
you
had
come
in
now
not
the
charming
familiar
sister
you
are
but
shorter
fatter
fair
and
round-faced
quite
different
physically
you
know--what
would
you
doâ€™
â€˜what
nonsense
you
talk
herbertâ€™
â€˜yes
but
supposing
a
complete
transmogrification--by
some
unimaginable
ingression
or
enchantment
by
nibbling
a
bunch
of
roses
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
itâ€™
â€˜only
physicallyâ€™
â€˜well
yes
actually
but
potentially
why--thatâ€™s
another
matterâ€™
the
dark
eyes
passed
slowly
from
her
brotherâ€™s
face
and
rested
gravely
on
their
visitorâ€™s
â€˜is
he
making
fun
of
meâ€™
lawford
almost
imperceptibly
shook
his
head
â€˜but
what
a
question
and
iâ€™ve
had
no
teaâ€™
she
drew
her
gloves
slowly
through
her
hand
â€˜the
thing
of
course
isnâ€™t
possible
i
know
but
shouldnâ€™t
i
go
mad
donâ€™t
you
thinkâ€™
lawford
gazed
quietly
back
into
the
clear
grave
deliberate
eyes
â€˜suppose
suppose
just
for
the
sake
of
argument--notâ€™
he
suggested
she
turned
her
head
and
reflected
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
pure
steady
candle-flames
â€˜and
what
was
your
answerâ€™
she
said
looking
over
her
shoulder
at
her
brother
â€˜my
dear
child
you
know
what
my
answers
are
likeâ€™
â€˜and
yoursâ€™
lawford
took
a
deep
breath
gazing
mutely
forlornly
into
the
lovely
untroubled
peace
of
her
eyes
and
without
the
least
warning
tears
swept
up
into
his
own
with
an
immense
effort
he
turned
and
choking
back
every
sound
beating
hack
every
thought
groped
his
way
towards
the
square
black
darkness
of
the
open
door
â€˜i
must
think
i
must
thinkâ€™
he
managed
to
whisper
lifting
his
hand
and
steadying
himself
he
caught
over
his
shoulder
the
glimpse
of
a
curiously
distorted
vision
a
lifted
candle
and
a
still
face
gazing
after
him
with
infinitely
grieved
eyes
then
found
himself
groping
and
stumbling
down
the
steep
uneven
staircase
into
the
darkness
of
the
queer
old
wooden
and
hushed
and
lonely
house
the
night
air
cold
on
his
face
calmed
his
mind
he
turned
and
held
out
his
hand
â€˜youâ€™ll
come
againâ€™
herbert
was
saying
with
a
hint
of
anxiety
even
of
apology
in
his
voice
lawford
nodded
with
eyes
fixed
blankly
on
the
candle
and
turning
once
more
made
his
way
slowly
down
the
narrow
green-bordered
path
upon
which
the
stars
rained
a
scattered
light
so
feeble
it
seemed
but
as
a
haze
that
blurred
the
darkness
he
pushed
open
the
little
white
wicket
and
turned
his
face
towards
the
soundless
leaf-crowned
hill
he
had
advanced
hardly
a
score
of
steps
in
the
thick
dust
when
almost
as
if
its
very
silence
had
struck
upon
his
ear
he
remembered
the
black
broken
grave
with
its
sightless
heads
that
lay
beyond
the
leaves
and
fear
vast
and
menacing
fear
such
as
only
children
know
broke
like
a
sea
of
darkness
on
his
heart
he
stopped
dead--cold
helpless
trembling
and
in
the
silence
he
heard
a
faint
cry
behind
him
and
light
footsteps
pursuing
him
he
turned
again
in
the
thick
close
gloom
beneath
the
enormous
elm-boughs
the
grey
eyes
shone
clearly
visible
in
the
face
upturned
to
him
â€˜my
brotherâ€™
she
began
breathlessly--â€˜the
little
french
book
it
was
i
who--who
mislaid
itâ€™
the
set
stricken
face
listened
unmoved
â€˜you
are
ill
come
back
i
am
afraid
you
are
very
illâ€™
â€˜itâ€™s
not
that
not
thatâ€™
lawford
muttered
â€˜donâ€™t
leave
me
i
am
alone
donâ€™t
question
meâ€™
he
said
strangely
looking
down
into
her
face
clutching
her
hand
â€˜only
understand
that
i
canâ€™t
i
canâ€™t
go
onâ€™
he
swept
a
lean
arm
towards
the
unseen
churchyard
â€˜i
am
afraidâ€™
the
cold
hand
clasped
his
closer
â€˜hush
donâ€™t
speak
come
back
come
back
i
am
with
you
a
friend
you
see
come
backâ€™
lawford
clutched
her
hand
as
a
blind
man
in
sudden
peril
might
clutch
the
hand
of
a
child
he
saw
nothing
clearly
spoke
almost
without
understanding
his
words
â€˜oh
but
itâ€™s
mustâ€™
he
said
â€˜i
must
go
on
you
see--why
everything
depends
on
struggling
through
the
future
but
if
you
only
knew--thereâ€™
again
his
arm
swept
out
and
the
lean
terrified
face
turned
shuddering
from
the
dark
â€˜i
do
know
believe
me
believe
me
i
can
guess
see
i
am
coming
with
you
we
will
go
together
as
if
as
if
i
did
not
know
what
it
is
to
be
afraid
oh
believe
me
no
one
is
near
we
go
on
and
see
it
gradually
gradually
lightens
how
thankful
i
am
i
cameâ€™
she
had
turned
and
they
were
steadily
ascending
as
if
pushing
their
way
battling
on
through
some
obstacle
of
the
mind
rather
than
of
the
senses
beneath
the
star-powdered
callous
vault
of
night
and
it
seemed
to
lawford
as
if
as
they
pressed
on
together
some
obscure
detestable
presence
as
slowly
as
doggedly
had
drawn
worsted
aside
he
could
see
again
the
peaceful
outspread
branches
of
the
trees
the
lych-gate
standing
in
clear-cut
silhouette
against
the
liquid
dusk
of
the
sky
a
strange
calm
stole
over
his
mind
the
very
meaning
and
memory
of
his
fear
faded
out
and
vanished
as
the
passed-away
clouds
of
a
storm
that
leave
a
purer
serener
sky
they
stopped
and
stood
together
on
the
brow
of
the
little
hill
and
lawford
still
trembling
from
head
to
foot
looked
back
across
the
hushed
and
lightless
countryside
â€˜itâ€™s
all
gone
nowâ€™
he
said
wearily
â€˜and
now
thereâ€™s
nothing
left
you
see
i
cannot
even
ask
your
forgiveness--and
a
strangerâ€™
â€˜please
donâ€™t
say
that--unless--unless--a
â€œpilgrimâ€
too
i
think
surely
you
must
own
we
did
have
the
best
of
it
that
time
yes--and
i
donâ€™t
care
who
may
be
listening--but
we
did
win
throughâ€™
â€˜what
can
i
say
how
shall
i
explain
how
shall
i
make
you
understandâ€™
the
clear
grey
eyes
showed
not
the
faintest
perturbation
â€˜but
i
do
i
do
indeed
in
part
i
do
understand
ever
so
faintlyâ€™
â€˜and
now
i
will
come
back
with
youâ€™
they
paused
in
the
darkness
face
to
face
the
silence
of
the
sky
arched
in
its
vastness
above
the
little
hill
the
only
witness
of
their
triumph
she
turned
unquestioningly
and
laughing
softly
almost
as
children
do
the
stalking
shadows
of
a
twilight
wood
behind
them--they
trod
in
silence
back
to
the
house
they
said
good-bye
at
the
gate
and
lawford
started
once
more
for
home
he
walked
slowly
conscious
of
an
almost
intolerable
weariness
as
if
his
strength
had
suddenly
been
wrested
away
from
him
and
at
some
distance
beyond
the
top
of
the
hill
he
sat
down
on
the
bank
beside
a
nettled
ditch
and
with
his
book
pressed
down
upon
the
wayside
grass
struck
a
match
and
holding
it
low
in
the
scented
windless
air
turned
slowly
the
cockled
leaf
few
of
them
were
alike
except
for
the
dinginess
of
the
print
and
the
sinister
smudge
of
the
portraits
all
were
sewn
roughly
together
into
a
mould-stained
marbled
cover
he
lit
a
second
match
and
as
he
did
so
glanced
as
if
inquiringly
over
his
shoulder
and
a
score
or
so
of
pages
before
the
end
he
came
at
last
upon
the
name
he
was
seeking
and
turned
the
page
it
was
a
likeness
even
more
striking
in
its
crudeness
of
ink
and
line
and
paper
than
the
most
finished
of
portraits
could
have
been
it
repelled
and
yet
it
fascinated
him
he
had
not
for
a
moment
doubted
herbertâ€™s
calm
conviction
and
yet
as
he
stooped
in
the
grass
closely
scrutinising
the
blurred
obscure
features
he
felt
the
faintest
surprise
not
so
much
at
the
significant
resemblance
but
at
his
own
composure
his
own
steady
unflinching
confrontation
with
this
sinister
and
intangible
adversary
the
match
burned
down
to
his
fingers
it
hissed
faintly
in
the
grass
he
stuffed
the
book
into
his
pocket
and
stared
into
the
pale
dial
of
his
watch
it
was
a
few
minutes
after
eleven
midnight
then
would
just
see
him
in
he
rose
stiffly
and
yawned
in
sheer
exhaustion
then
hesitating
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
back
towards
the
hollow
but
a
vague
foreboding
held
him
back
a
sour
and
vacuous
incredulity
swept
over
him
what
was
the
use
of
all
this
struggling
and
vexation
what
gain
in
living
on
once
dead
his
sluggish
spirit
at
least
would
find
its
rest
dust
to
dust
it
would
indeed
be
for
him
what
else
in
sober
earnest
had
he
been
all
his
daily
stolid
life
but
half
dead
scarce
conscious
without
a
living
thought
or
desire
in
head
or
heart
and
while
he
was
still
gloomily
debating
within
himself
he
had
turned
towards
home
and
soon
was
walking
in
a
kind
of
reverie
even
his
extreme
tiredness
in
part
forgotten
and
only
a
far-away
dogged
recollection
in
his
mind
that
in
spite
of
shame
in
spite
of
all
his
miserable
weakness
the
words
had
been
uttered
once
for
all
and
in
all
sincerity
â€˜we
did
win
throughâ€™
yet
a
desolate
and
odd
air
of
strangeness
seemed
to
drape
his
unlighted
house
as
he
stood
looking
up
in
a
kind
of
furtive
communion
with
its
windows
it
affected
him
with
that
discomforting
air
of
extreme
and
meaningless
novelty
that
things
very
familiar
sometimes
take
upon
themselves
in
this
leaden
tiredness
no
impression
could
be
trustworthy
his
lids
shut
of
themselves
as
he
softly
mounted
the
steps
it
seemed
a
needlessly
wide
door
that
soundlessly
admitted
him
but
however
hard
he
pressed
the
key
his
bedroom
door
remained
stubbornly
shut
until
he
found
that
it
was
already
unlocked
and
he
had
only
to
turn
the
handle
a
night-light
burned
in
a
little
basin
on
the
washstand
the
room
was
hung
as
it
were
with
the
stillness
of
night
and
half
lying
on
the
bed
in
her
dressing-gown
her
head
leaning
on
the
rail
at
the
foot
was
alice
just
as
sleep
had
overtaken
her
lawford
returned
to
the
door
and
listened
it
seemed
he
heard
a
voice
talking
downstairs
and
yet
not
talking
for
it
ran
on
and
on
in
an
incessant
slightly
argumentative
monotony
that
had
neither
break
nor
interruption
he
closed
the
door
and
stooping
laid
his
hand
softly
on
aliceâ€™s
narrow
still
childish
hand
that
lay
half-folded
on
her
knee
her
eyes
opened
instantly
and
gazed
widely
into
his
face
a
slow
vacant
smile
of
sleep
came
and
went
and
her
fingers
tightened
gently
over
his
as
again
her
lids
drooped
down
over
the
drowsy
blue
eyes
â€˜at
last
at
last
dearâ€™
she
said
â€˜i
have
been
waiting
such
a
time
but
we
mustnâ€™t
talk
much
mother
is
waiting
up
readingâ€™
faintly
through
the
close-shut
door
came
the
sound
of
that
distant
expressionless
voice
monotonously
rising
and
falling
â€˜why
didnâ€™t
you
tell
me
dearâ€™
alice
still
sleepily
whispered
â€˜would
i
have
asked
a
single
question
how
could
i
oh
if
you
had
only
trusted
meâ€™
â€˜but
the
change--the
change
alice
you
must
have
seen
that
you
spoke
to
me
you
did
think
i
was
only
a
stranger
and
even
when
you
knew
it
was
only
fear
on
your
face
dearest
and
aversion
and
you
turned
to
your
mother
first
donâ€™t
think
alice
that
i
amgod
only
knows--iâ€™m
not
complaining
but
truth
is
best
whatever
it
is
i
do
feel
that
you
mustnâ€™t
be
afraid
of
hurting
me
my
dearâ€™
her
very
hands
seemed
to
quicken
in
his
as
now
with
sleep
quite
gone
the
fret
of
memory
returned
and
she
must
reassure
both
herself
and
him
â€˜but
you
see
dear
mother
had
told
me
that
you--besides
i
did
know
you
at
once
really
quite
inside
you
know
deep
down
i
know
i
was
perplexed
i
didnâ€™t
understand
but
that
was
all
why
even
when
you
came
up
in
the
dark
and
we
talked--if
you
only
knew
how
miserable
i
had
been--though
i
knew
even
then
there
was
something
different
still
i
was
not
a
bit
afraid
was
i
and
shouldnâ€™t
i
have
been
afraid
horribly
afraid
if
you
had
not
been
youâ€™
she
repressed
a
little
shudder
and
clasped
his
hand
more
closely
â€˜donâ€™t
let
us
say
anything
more
about
it
she
implored
him
â€˜we
are
just
together
again
you
and
i
that
is
all
that
mattersâ€™
but
her
words
were
like
brave
soldiers
who
have
fought
their
way
through
an
ambuscade
but
have
left
all
confidence
behind
them
lawford
listened
and
that
was
enough
just
now--that
she
still
in
spite
of
doubt
believed
in
him
and
thought
and
cared
for
him
he
was
too
tired
to
have
refused
the
least
kindness
he
made
no
answer
but
leant
his
head
on
the
cool
slender
fingers
in
gratitude
and
peace
and
just
as
he
was
he
almost
instantly
fell
asleep
he
woke
in
the
darkness
to
find
himself
alone
he
groped
his
way
heavily
to
the
door
and
turned
the
handle
but
now
it
was
really
locked
energy
failed
him
â€˜i
suppose--sheilaâ€™
he
muttered
sheila
calm
alert
reserved
was
sitting
at
the
open
window
when
he
awoke
again
his
breakfast
tray
stood
on
a
little
table
beside
the
bed
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
looked
at
his
wife
the
morning
light
shone
full
on
her
features
as
she
turned
quickly
at
sound
of
his
stirring
â€˜you
have
slept
lateâ€™
she
said
in
a
low
mellow
voice
â€˜have
i
sheila
i
suppose
i
was
tired
out
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
have
got
everything
ready
like
thisâ€™
â€˜i
am
afraid
arthur
i
was
thinking
rather
of
the
maids
i
like
to
inconvenience
them
as
little
as
possible
in
their
usual
routine
i
mean
how
are
you
feeling
do
you
think
this
morningâ€™
â€˜i--i
havenâ€™t
seen
the
glass
sheilaâ€™
she
paused
to
place
a
little
pencil
tick
at
the
foot
of
the
page
of
her
butcherâ€™s
book
â€˜and
did
you--did
you
tryâ€™
â€˜did
i
try
try
whatâ€™
â€˜i
understoodâ€™
she
said
turning
slowly
in
her
chair
â€˜you
gave
me
to
understand
that
you
went
out
with
the
specific
intention
of
trying
to
regain
but
there
forgive
me
arthur
i
think
i
must
be
getting
a
little
bit
hardened
to
the
position
so
far
at
least
as
any
hope
is
in
my
mind
of
rather
amateurish
experiments
being
of
much
help
i
may
seem
unsympathetic
in
saying
frankly
what
i
feel
but
amateurish
or
no
you
are
curiously
erratic
why
if
you
really
were
the
dr
ferguson
whose
part
you
play
so
admirably
you
could
scarcely
spend
a
more
active
lifeâ€™
â€˜all
you
mean
sheila
i
suppose
is
that
i
have
failedâ€™
â€˜â€œfailedâ€
did
not
enter
my
mind
i
thought
looking
at
you
just
now
in
your
clothes
on
the
bed
one
might
for
the
moment
be
deceived
into
thinking
there
was
a
slight--quite
the
slightest
improvement
there
was
not
quite
thatâ€™--she
hovered
for
the
right
word--â€˜that
tenseness
whether
or
not
whether
you
desired
any
such
change
or
didnâ€™t
i
should
have
supposed
in
any
case
it
would
have
been
better
to
act
as
far
as
possible
like
any
ordinary
person
you
were
certainly
in
an
extraordinarily
sound
sleep
i
was
almost
alarmed
until
i
remembered
that
it
was
a
little
after
two
when
i
looked
up
from
reading
aloud
to
keep
myself
awake
and
discovered
that
you
had
only
just
come
home
i
had
no
fire
you
know
how
easily
late
hours
bring
on
my
headaches
a
little
thought
might
possibly
have
suggested
that
i
should
be
anxious
to
hear
but
no
it
seems
i
cannot
profit
by
experience
arthur
and
even
now
you
have
not
answered
surely
a
very
natural
question
you
do
not
recollect
perhaps
exactly
what
did
happen
last
night
did
you
go
in
the
direction
even
of
widderstoneâ€™
â€˜yes
sheila
i
went
to
widderstoneâ€™
â€˜it
was
of
course
absurd
to
suppose
that
sitting
on
a
seat
beside
the
broken-down
grave
of
a
suicide
would
have
the
slightest
effect
on
oneâ€™s--oneâ€™s
physical
condition
though
possibly
it
might
affect
oneâ€™s
brain
it
would
mine
i
am
at
least
certain
of
that
it
was
your
own
prescription
however
and
it
merely
occurred
to
me
to
inquire
whether
the
actual
experience
has
not
brought
you
round
to
my
own
opinionâ€™
â€˜yes
i
think
it
hasâ€™
lawford
answered
calmly
â€˜but
i
donâ€™t
quite
see
what
suicide
has
got
to
do
with
it
unless--you
know
widderstone
then
sheilaâ€™
â€˜i
drove
there
last
saturday
afternoonâ€™
â€˜for
prayer
or
praiseâ€™
although
lawford
had
not
actually
raised
his
head
he
became
conscious
rather
of
the
wonderfully
adjusted
mass
of
hair
than
of
the
pained
dignity
in
the
face
that
was
now
closely
regarding
him
â€˜i
wentâ€™
came
the
rigidly
controlled
retort
â€˜simply
to
test
an
inconceivable
storyâ€™
â€˜and
returnedâ€™
â€˜convinced
arthur
of
its
inconceivability
but
if
you
would
kindly
inform
me
what
precise
formula
you
followed
at
widderstone
last
night
i
would
tell
you
why
i
think
the
explanation
or
rather
your
first
account
of
the
matter
is
not
an
explanation
of
the
factsâ€™
lawford
shot
a
rather
doglike
glance
over
his
toast
â€˜dantonâ€™
he
said
â€˜candidly
arthur
mr
danton
doubts
the
whole
story
your
very
conduct--well
it
would
serve
no
useful
purpose
to
go
into
that
candidly
on
the
other
hand
mr
danton
did
make
some
extremely
helpful
suggestions--basing
them
of
course
on
the
truth
of
your
account
he
has
seen
a
good
deal
of
life
and
certainly
very
mysterious
things
do
occur
to
quite
innocent
and
well-meaning
people
without
the
faintest
shadow
of
warning
and
as
mr
bethany
himself
said
evil
birds
do
come
home
to
roost
and
often
out
of
a
clear
sky
as
it
were
but
there
every
fresh
solution
that
occurs
to
me
only
makes
the
thing
more
preposterous
more
i
was
going
to
say
disreputable--i
mean
of
course
to
the
outside
world
and
we
have
our
duties
to
perform
to
them
too
i
suppose
why
what
can
we
say
what
plausible
account
of
ourselves
have
we
we
shall
never
be
able
to
look
anybody
in
the
face
again
i
can
only--i
am
compelled
to
believe
that
god
has
been
pleased
to
make
this
precise
visitation
upon
us--an
eye
for
an
eye
i
suppose
somewhere
and
to
that
conviction
i
shall
hold
until
actual
circumstances
convince
me
that
itâ€™s
false
what
however
and
this
is
all
that
i
have
to
say
now
what
i
cannot
understand
are
your
amazing
indiscretionsâ€™
â€˜do
you
understand
your
own
sheilaâ€™
â€˜my
indiscretions
arthurâ€™
â€˜wellâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜wasnâ€™t
it
indiscreet
donâ€™t
you
think
to

divine
retribution
by
marrying

you
have
inquired
wasnâ€™t
it
indiscreet
to
allow
me
to
remain
here
in--in
my
â€œvisitationâ€
wasnâ€™t
it
indiscreet
to
risk
the
moral
stigma
this
unhappy
face
of
mine
must
cast
on
its
surroundings
i
am
not
sure
whether
such
a
change
as
this
constitutes
cruelty

what
is
the
use
of
fretting
and
babbling
on
like
thisâ€™
â€˜am

understand
then
that

refuse
positively
to
discuss
this
horrible
business
any
more

are
doing
your
best
to
drive
me
away

you
must
see

you
be
very
disappointed

lawford
rose
from
the
bed
â€˜listen
just
this
onceâ€™
he
said
seating
himself
on
the
corner
of
the
dressing-table
â€˜imagine
all
this--whatever
you
like
to
call
it--obliterated
take
thisâ€™
he
nodded
towards
the
glass
â€˜entirely
for
itself
on
its
own
merits

it
were

the
dead
past
bury
its
dead

now
precisely
really
do
you
prefer--himâ€™
he
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
dispassionate
youthful
picture
on
the
wall
â€˜him
or
meâ€™
he
was
so
close
to
her
now
that
he
could
see
the
faintest
tremor
on
the
face
that
had
suddenly
become
grey
and
still
in
the
thin
clear
sunshine
â€˜i
own
it
i
own
itâ€™
he
went
on
slowly
â€˜the
change
is
more
than
skin-deep

one

i

sheila
slowly
raised
her
eyes
â€˜it
is
because
my

you
donâ€™t
care

ghost

one--he

out
long

going-on

down

any
other
faded
remembrance
in
this
interminable
footling
with
truth
that
we
call

this
one--the
whole
abject
meaning
of
it
lies
simply
in
the
fact
that
it
has
pierced
down

shown
us
up

no

feeble

turned
away
and
stood
staring
down
at
the
cinders
in
the
fireless
grate
â€˜i

mad

goâ€™
â€˜you
sat
there
just
as
you
said
you
sat
before
and
with
all
your
heart
and
soul
strove
to
regain--yourselfâ€™
lawford
lifted
a
still
colourless
face
into
the
sunlight
â€˜noâ€™
he
said
â€˜i
spent
the
evening
at
the
house
of
a
friendâ€™
â€˜then
i
say
it
is
infamous
you
cast
all
this
on
me
you
have
brought
me
into
contempt
and
poisoned
aliceâ€™s
whole
life
you
dream
and
idle
on
just
as
you
used
to
do
without
the
least
care
or
thought
or
consideration
for
others
and
go
out
in
this
condition--go
out
absolutely
unashamed--to
spend
the
evening
at
a
friendâ€™s
peculiar
friends
they
must
be
why
really
arthur
you
must
be
madâ€™
lawford
paused
like
a
flock
of
sheep
streaming
helter-skelter
before
the
onset
of
a
wolf
were
the
thoughts
that
a
moment
before
had
seemed
so
orderly
and
sober
â€˜not
mad--possessedâ€™
he
said
softly
â€˜and
i
add
thisâ€™
cried
sheila
as
it
were
out
of
a
tragic
mask
â€˜somewhere
in
the
past
whether
of
your
own
life
or
of
the
lives
of
those
who
brought
you
into
the
world--the
world
which
you
pretend
so
conveniently
to
despise--somewhere
is
hidden
some
miserable
secret
god
visits
all
sins
on
you
has
fallen
at
last
the
payment
that
i
believe
you
canâ€™t
run
away
any
more
than
a
child
can
run
away
from
the
cupboard
it
has
been
locked
into
for
a
punishment
whoâ€™s
going
to
hear
you
now
you
have
deliberately
refused
to
make
a
friend
of
me
fight
it
out
alone
thenâ€™
lawford
heard
the
door
close
and
the
dying
away
of
the
sound
that
had
been
the
unceasing
accompaniment
of
all
these
later
years--the
rustling
of
his
wifeâ€™s
skirts
her
crisp
authoritative
footstep
and
he
turned
towards
the
flooding
sunlight
that
streamed
in
on
the
upturned
surface
of
the
looking-glass
no
clear
decisive
thought
came
into
his
mind
only
a
vague
recognition
that
so
far
as
sheila
was
concerned
this
was
the
end
no
regret
no
remorse
visited
him
he
was
just
alone
again
that
was
all--alone
as
in
reality
he
had
always
been
alone
without
having
the
sense
or
power
to
see
or
to
acknowledge
it
all
he
had
said
had
been
the
mere
flotsam
of
the
moment
and
now
it
stood
stark
and
irrevocable
between
himself
and
the
past
he
sat
down
dazed
and
stupid
again
and
again
a
struggling
recollection
tried
to
obtrude
itself
again
and
again
he
beat
it
back
and
rather
for
something
to
distract
his
attention
than
for
any
real
interest
or
enlightenment
he
might
find
in
its
pages
he
took
out
the
grimy
dogâ€™s-eared
book
that
herbert
had
given
him
and
turned
slowly
over
the
leaves
till
he
came
to
sabathier
once
more
snatches
of
remembrance
of
their
long
talk
returned
to
him
but
just
as
that
dark
water-haunted
house
had
seemed
to
banish
remembrance
and
the
reality
of
the
room
in
which
he
now
sat
and
of
the
old
familiar
life
so
now
the
house
the
faces
of
yesterday
seemed
in
their
turn
unreal
almost
spectral
and
the
thick
print
on
the
smudgy
page
no
more
significant
than
a
story
one
reads
and
throws
away
but
a
momentâ€™s
comparison
in
the
glass
of
the
two
faces
side
by
side
suddenly
sharpened
his
attention--the
resemblance
was
so
oddly
arresting
and
yet
and
yet
so
curiously
inconclusive
there
was
then
something
of
the
stolid
old
saxon
left
he
thought
or
had
it
been
regained
which
was
it
not
merely
the
complexity
of
the
question
but
a
half-conscious
distaste
of
attempting
to
face
it
set
him
reading
very
slowly
and
laboriously
for
his
french
was
little
more
than
fragmentary
recollection
the
first
few
pages
of
the
life
of
this
buried
sabathier
but
with
a
disinclination
almost
amounting
to
aversion
he
made
very
slow
progress
many
of
the
words
were
meaningless
to
him
and
every
other
moment
he
found
himself
listening
with
intense
concentration
for
the
least
hint
of
what
sheila
was
doing
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
house
beneath
him
he
had
not
very
long
to
wait
he
was
sitting
with
his
head
leaning
on
his
hand
the
book
unheeded
beneath
the
other
on
the
table
when
the
door
opened
again
behind
him
and
sheila
entered
she
stood
for
a
moment
calm
and
dignified
looking
down
on
him
through
her
veil
â€˜please
understand
arthur
that
i
am
not
taking
this
step
in
pique
or
even
in
anger
it
would
serve
no
purpose
to
go
on
like
this--this
incessant
heedlessness
and
recrimination
there
have
been
mistakes
misconceptions
perhaps
on
both
sides
to
me
naturally
yours
are
most
conspicuous
that
need
not
however
blind
me
to
my
ownâ€™
she
paused
in
vain
for
an
answer
â€˜think
the
whole
thing
over
candidly
and
quietlyâ€™
she
began
again
in
a
quiet
rapid
voice
â€˜have
you
really
shown
the
slightest
regard
i
wonâ€™t
say
for
me
or
even
for
alice
but
for
just
the
obvious
difficulties
and--and
proprieties
of
our
position
i
have
given
up
as
far
as
i
can
brooding
on
and
on
over
the
same
horrible
impossible
thoughts
i
withdraw
unreservedly
what
i
said
just
now
about
punishment
whatever
the
evidence
it
is
not
even
a
wifeâ€™s
place
to
judge
like
that
you
will
forgive
me
thatâ€™
lawford
did
not
turn
his
head
â€˜of
courseâ€™
he
said
looking
rather
vacantly
out
of
the
window
â€˜it
was
only
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
sheila
though
who
knows
it
may
be
trueâ€™
â€˜wellâ€™
she
took
hold
of
the
great
brass
knob
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
with
one
gloved
hand--â€˜well
i
feel
it
is
my
duty
to
withdraw
it
apart
from
it
i
see
only
too
clearly
that
even
though
all
that
has
happened
in
these
last
few
days
was
in
reality
nothing
but
a
horrible
nightmare
i
see
that
even
then
what
you
have
said
about
our
married
life
together
can
never
be
recalled
you
have
told
me
quite
deliberately
that
for
years
past
your
life
has
been
nothing
but
a
pretence--a
sham
you
implied
that
mine
had
been
too
honestly
i
was
not
aware
of
it
arthur
but
supposing
all
that
has
happened
to
you
had
been
merely
what
might
happen
at
any
moment
to
anybody
some
actual
defacement
you
will
forgive
me
suggesting
such
a
horrible
thing--why
if
what
you
say
is
true
even
in
that
case
my
sympathy
would
have
been
only
a
continual
fret
and
annoyance
to
you
and
this--this
change
i
own
is
infinitely
harder
to
bear
it
would
be
an
outrage
on
common
sense
and
on
all
that
we
hold
seemly
and--and
sacred
in
life
even
in
some
trumpery
story
you
do
you
must
see
all
that
arthurâ€™
â€˜oh
yesâ€™
said
lawford
narrowing
his
eyes
to
pierce
through
the
sunlight
â€˜i
see
all
thatâ€™
â€˜then
we
need
not
go
over
it
all
again
whatever
others
may
say
or
think
i
shall
still
at
least
so
long
as
nothing
occurs
to
the
contrary
keep
firmly
to
my
present
convictions
mr
bethany
has
assured
me
repeatedly
that
he
has
no--no
misgivings
that
he
understands
and
even
if
i
still
doubted
which
i
donâ€™t
arthur
though
it
would
be
rather
trying
to
have
to
accept
oneâ€™s
husband
at
second-hand
as
it
were
i
should
have
to
be
satisfied
i
dare
say
even
such
an
unheard-of
thing
as
what
we
are
discussing
now
or
something
equally
ghastly
does
occur
occasionally
in
foreign
countries
perhaps
i
have
not
studied
such
things
enough
to
say
we
were
all
very
much
restricted
in
our
reading
as
children
and
i
honestly
think
not
unwisely
it
is
enough
for
the
present
to
repeat
that
i
do
believe
and
that
whatever
may
happen--and
i
know
absolutely
nothing
about
the
procedure
in
such
cases--but
whatever
may
happen
i
shall
still
be
loyal
i
shall
always
have
your
interests
at
heartâ€™
her
words
faltered
and
she
turned
her
head
away
â€˜you
did
love
me
once
arthur
i
canâ€™t
forget
thatâ€™
the
contralto
voice
trembled
ever
so
little
and
the
gloved
hand
smoothed
gently
the
brass
knob
beneath
â€˜ifâ€™
said
lawford
resting
his
face
on
his
hands
and
curiously
watching
the
while
his
moving
reflection
in
the
looking-glass
before
him--â€˜if
i
said
i
still
loved
you
what
then
â€˜but
you
have
already
denied
it
arthurâ€™
â€˜yes
but
if
i
said
that
that
too
was
said
only
in
haste
that
brooding
over
the
trouble
this--this
metamorphosis
was
bringing
on
us
all
had
driven
me
almost
beyond
endurance
supposing
that
i
withdrew
all
that
and
instead
said
now
that
i
do
still
love
you
just
as
i--â€™
he
turned
a
little
and
turned
back
again
â€˜like
thisâ€™
sheila
paused
â€˜could
any
woman
answer
such
a
questionâ€™
she
almost
sighed
at
last
â€˜yes
butâ€™
lawford
pressed
on
in
a
voice
almost
naive
and
stubborn
as
a
childâ€™s
â€˜if
i
tried
to--to
make
you
i
did
once
sheilaâ€™
â€˜i
canâ€™t
i
canâ€™t
conceive
such
a
position
surely
that
alone
is
almost
as
frantic
as
it
is
heartless

it
is
it
even
rightâ€™
â€˜well
i
have
not
actually
asked
it
i
ownâ€™
he
added
moodily
almost
under
his
breath
â€˜it
would
be--dangerous
but
there
sheila
this
poor
old
mask
of
mine
is
wearing
out
i
am
somehow
convinced
of
that
what
will
be
left
god
only
knows
you
were
saying--â€™
he
rose
abruptly
â€˜please
please
sit
downâ€™
he
said
â€˜i
did
not
notice
you
were
standingâ€™
â€˜i
shall
not
keep
you
a
momentâ€™
she
answered
hurriedly
â€˜i
will
sit
here
the
truth
is
arthurâ€™
she
began
again
almost
solemnly
â€˜apart
from
all
sentiment
and--and
good
intentions
my
presence
here
only
harasses
you
and
keeps
you
back
i
am
not
so
bound
up
in
myself
that
i
cannot
realise
that
the
consequence
is
that
after
calmly--and
i
hope
considerately--thinking
the
whole
thing
over
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
arouse
very
little
comment
the
least
possible
perhaps
in
the
circumstances
if
i
just
went
away
for
a
few
days
you
are
not
in
any
sense
ill
in
fact
i
have
never
known
you
so--so
robust
so
energetic
you
will
be
alone
mr
bethany
perhaps
you
could
go
out
and
come
in
just
as
you
pleased
possiblyâ€™
sheila
smiled
frankly
beneath
her
veil
â€˜even
this
dr
ferguson
you
have
invented
will
be
a
help
itâ€™s
only
the
servants
that
remain
to

consideredâ€™
â€˜i
should
prefer
to
be
quite
aloneâ€™
â€˜then
do
not
worry
about
them
i
can
easily
explain
and
if
you
would
not
mind
letting
her
in
mrs
gull
can
come
in
every
other
day
or
so
just
to
keep
things
in

entirely
trustworthy
and
discreet

perhaps
if
you
would
prefer--â€™
â€˜mrs
gull
will
do
nicely
sheila
itâ€™s
very
good
of
you
to
have
given
me
so
much

a
long
and
rather
arduous
pause
followed
â€˜oh
one
other
thing
arthur
you
sent
out
to
mr
critchett--do
you
remember--the
night
you
first
came
home

think
too
after
the
first
awful
shock
when
we
were
sitting
in
our
bedroom
you
actually
referred
to--to
violent
measures
you
will
promise
me
i
may
perhaps
at
least
ask
that
you
will
promise
me
on
your
word
of
honour
for
aliceâ€™s
sake
if
not
for
mine
to
do
nothing
rashâ€™
â€˜yes
yesâ€™
said
lawford
sinking
lower
even
than
he
had
supposed
possible
into
the
thin
and
lightless
chill
of
ennui--â€˜nothing
rashâ€™
sheila
rose
with
a
sigh
only
in
part
suppressed
â€˜i
have
not
seen
mr
bethany
again
i
think
however
it
would
be
better
to
let
harry
know
i
mean
dear
of
your
derangement
after
all
he
is
one
of
the
family--at
least
of
mine
he
will
not
interfere
he
would
perhaps
quite
naturally
be
hurt
if
we
did
not
take
him
into
our
confidence
otherwise
there
is
no
pressing
cause
for
haste
at
least
for
another
week
or
so
after
that
i
suppose
something
will
have
to
be
done
then
thereâ€™s
mr
wedderburn
wouldnâ€™t
it
be
as
well
to
let
him
know
that
at

for
the
present
you
are
quite
unable
to
think
of
returning
to
town
that
too
in
time
will
have
to
be
arranged
i
suppose
if
nothing
happens

i
mean
if
things
donâ€™t
come
right

i
do
hope
arthur
you
will
not
set
your
mind
too
closely
on
what
may
only
prove
false

is
all
intensely
painful
to
me

course

us

again
lawford
even
though
he
did
not
turn
to
confront
it
became
conscious
of
the
black
veil
turned
towards
him
tentatively
speculatively
impenetrably
â€˜yesâ€™
he
said
â€˜iâ€™ll
write
to
wedderburn

had
his
ups
and
downs
tooâ€™
â€˜i
always
rather
fancied

said
sheila
reflectively
â€˜he
looks
rather
a--a
restless
man
oh
and
then
againâ€™
she
broke
off
quickly
â€˜thereâ€™s
the
question
of

suppose--it
is
only
a
conjecture--i

gone
to

enough

needsâ€™
â€˜as
a
bribe
hush-money

a
thank-offering

murmured
her
husband
wearily
â€˜i
donâ€™t
follow
youâ€™
replied
the
discreet
voice
from
beneath
the
veil
he
did
actually
turn
this
time
and
glance
steadily
over
his
shoulder
â€˜how
long
are
you
going
for
and
whereâ€™
â€˜i
proposed
to
go
to
my
cousinâ€™s

lovatâ€™s

is
of

you
have
no

near

will
be
a
long-deferred

sheila
pondered
â€˜you
think

all

ought
to
have

candidly

canâ€™t
see

of

proves
that
in
intimate
domestic
matters

especially
in
those
between
husband
and

the
parties
concerned
have
any
means
of
judging
what
is

has
been
our
experience
at
any
rate

i
must
in
fairness
confess
that
outwardly
at

i
havenâ€™t
had
much
of
that
kind

to
complain
ofâ€™
sheila
paused
again
for
a
reply
â€˜what
kind
of
thingâ€™
â€˜domestic
experience
dearâ€™
the
house
was
quiet
there
was
not
a
sound
stirring
in
the
still
sunny
road
of
orchards
and
discreet
and
drowsy
villas
a
long
silence
followed
immensely
active
and
alert
on
the
one
side
almost
morbidly
lethargic
so
far
as
the
stooping
figure
in
front
of
the
looking-glass
was
concerned
at
last
the
last
haunting
question
came
in
a
kind
of
croak
as
if
only
by
a
supreme
effort
could
it
be
compelled
to
produce
itself
for
consideration
â€˜and
alice

â€˜alice

goes
with

â€˜you

he
stirred
uneasily
you
realise
it
may
be
finalâ€™
â€˜my
dear
arthurâ€™
cried
sheila
â€˜it
is
surely
apart
from
mere
delicacy

shock

a

her
motherâ€™s
at
present
she
only
vaguely
guesses
to
know
definitely
that
her
father
infinitely
worse
than
death
had--had--oh
is
it
possible
to
realise
anything
in
this
awful
cloud
it
would
kill
her
outrightâ€™
lawford
made
no
stir
the
quietest
of
raps
came
at
the
door
â€˜the
money
from
the
bank
maâ€™amâ€™
said
a
faint
voice
sheila
carefully
opened
the
door
a
few
inches
she
laid
the
blue
envelope
on
the
dressing-table
at
her
husbandâ€™s
elbow
â€˜you
had
better
perhaps
count
itâ€™
she
said
in
a
low
voice--â€˜forty
in
notes
the
rest
in
goldâ€™
and
narrowed
her
eyes
beneath
her
veil
upon
her
husbandâ€™s
very
peculiar
method
of
forgetting
his
responsibilities
â€˜frenchâ€™
she
said
with
a
nod
â€˜how
very
quaintâ€™
lawfordâ€™s
eyes
fell
and
rested
gravely
on
the
dingy
page
of
herbertâ€™s
mean-looking
bundle
of
print
a
queer
feeling
of
cold
crept
over
him
â€˜yesâ€™
he
said
vaguely
â€˜frenchâ€™
and
hopelessly
failed
to
fill
in
the
silence
that
seemed
like
some
rather
sleek
nocturnal
creature
quietly
waiting
to
be
fed
sheila
swept
softly
towards
the
door
â€˜well
arthur
i
think
that
is
all
the
servants
will
have
gone
by
this
evening
i
have
ordered
a
carriage
for
half-past
twelve
perhaps
you
would
first
write
down
anything
that
occurs
to
you
to
be
necessary
perhaps
too
it
would
be
better
if
dr
simon
were
told
that
we
shall
not
need
him
any
more
that
you
are
thinking
of
a
complete
change
of
scene
a
voyage
he
is
obviously
useless
besides
mr
bethany
i
think
is
going
to
discuss
a
specialist
with
you
i
have
written
him
a
little
note
just
briefly
explaining
shall
i
write
to
dr
simon
tooâ€™
â€˜you
remember
everythingâ€™
said
lawford
and
it
seemed
to
him
it
was
a
remark
he
had
heard
ages
and
ages
ago
â€˜itâ€™s
only
this
money
sheila
will
you
please
take
that
awayâ€™
â€˜take
it
awayâ€™
â€˜i
think
sheila
if
i
do
take
a
voyage
i
should
almost
prefer
to
work
my
passage
as
for
a
mere
â€œchange
of
sceneâ€
thatâ€™s
quite
uncostlyâ€™
â€˜it
is
only

sheila
solemnly

wicked

day

perhaps
repent

â€˜it

possible

none

rips
open
a
lid
sometimes
and
the
wax

rots
before
oneâ€™s
eyes
take
back
your
blue
envelope

thank
you
for
thinking
of
me
itâ€™s
always
the
woman
of
the
house
that
has
the
headâ€™
â€˜i
wishâ€™
said
sheila
almost
pathetically
and
yet
with
a
faint
quaver
of
resignation
â€˜i
wish
it
could
be
said
that
the
man
of
the
house
sometimes
has
the
heart
think
it
over
arthurâ€™
sheila
with
her
husbandâ€™s
luncheon
tray
brought
also
her
farewells
lawford
surveyed
not
without
a
faint
shy
stirring
of
incredulity
the
superbly
restrained
presence
he
stood
before
her
dry-lipped
inarticulate
a
schoolboy
caught
redhanded
in
the
shabbiest
of
offences
â€˜it
is
your
wish
then
that
i
go
arthurâ€™
she
said
pleadingly
he
handed
her
her
money
without
a
word
â€˜very
well
arthur
if
you
wonâ€™t
take
itâ€™
she
said
â€˜i
should
scarcely
have
thought
this
the
occasion
for
mere
prideâ€™
â€˜the
tenthâ€™
she
continued
as
she
squeezed
the
envelope
into
her
purse
with
only
the
least
hardening
of
voice
â€˜although
i
daresay
you
have
not
troubled
to
remember
it--the
tenth
will
be
the
eighteenth
anniversary
of
our
wedding-day
it
makes
parting
however
advisable
and
though
only
for
the
few
days
we
should
think
nothing
of
in
happier
circumstances
a
little
harder
to
bear
but
there
all
will
come
right
you
will
see
things
in
a
different
light
perhaps
words
may
wound
but
time
will
healâ€™
but
even
as
she
now
looked
closely
into
his
colourless
sunken
face
some
distant
memory
seemed
to
well
up
irresistibly--the
memory
of
eyes
just
as
ingenuous
and
as
unassuming
that
even
in
claiming
her
love
had
expressed
only
their
stolid
unworthiness
â€˜did
you
know
it
have
you
seen
itâ€™
she
said
stooping
forward
a
little
â€˜i
believe
in
spite
of
allâ€™
he
gazed
on
solemnly
almost
owlishly
out
of
his
fading
mask
â€˜wait
till
mr
bethany
tells
you
you
will
believe
it
perhaps
from
himâ€™
he
saw
the
grey-gloved
hand
a
little
reluctantly
lifted
towards
him
â€˜good-bye
sheilaâ€™
he
said
and
turned
mechanically
back
to
the
window
she
hesitated
listening
to
a
small
far-away
voice
that
kept
urging
her
with
an
almost
frog-like
pertinacity
to
do
to
say
something
and
yet
as
stubbornly
would
not
say
what
and
she
was
gone
raying
and
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
the
hired
landau
drove
up
to
the
gate
lawford
peeping
between
the
blinds
looked
down
on
the
coachman
with
reins
hanging
loosely
from
his
red
squat-thumbed
hand
seated
in
his
tight
livery
and
indescribable
hat
on
the
faded
cushions
one
thing
only
was
in
his
mind
and
it
was
almost
with
an
audible
cry
that
he
turned
towards
the
figure
that
edged
white
and
trembling
into
the
chill
room
to
fling
herself
into
his
arms
â€˜donâ€™t
look
at
meâ€™
he
begged
her
â€˜only
remember
dearest
i
would
rather
have
died
down
there
and
been
never
seen
again
than
have
given
you
pain
run--run
your
motherâ€™s
calling
write
to
me
think
of
me
good-byeâ€™
he
threw
himself
on
the
bed
and
lay
there
till
evening--till
the
door
had
shut
gently
behind
the
last
rat
to
leave
the
sinking
ship
all
the
clearness
the
calmness
were
gone
again
round
and
round
in
dizzy
sickening
flare
and
clatter
his
thoughts
whirled
contempt
fear
loathing
blasphemy
laughter
longing
there
was
no
end
death
was
no
end
there
was
no
meaning
no
refuge
no
hope
no
possible
peace
to
give
up
was
to
go
to
perdition
to
go
forward
was
to
go
mad
and
even
madness--he
sat
up
with
trembling
lips
in
the
twilight--madness
itself
was
only
a
state
only
a
state
you
might
be
bereaved
and
the
pain
and
hopelessness
of
that
would
pass
you
might
be
cast
out
betrayed
deserted
and
still
be
you
still
find
solitude
lovely
and
in
a
brave
face
a
friend
but
madness--it
surged
in
on
him
with
all
the
clearness
and
emptiness
of
a
dream
and
he
sat
quite
still
his
hand
clutching
the
bedclothes
his
head
askew
waiting
for
the
sound
of
footsteps
for
the
presences
and
the
voices
that
have
their
thin-walled
dwelling
beneath
the
shallow
crust
of
consciousness
inky
blackness
drifted
up
in
wisps
in
smoke
before
his
eyes
he
was
powerless
to
move
to
cry
out
there
was
no
room
to
turn
no
air
to
breathe
and
yet
there
was
a
low
continuous
never-varying
stir
as
of
an
enormous
wheel
whirling
in
the
gloom
countless
infinitesimal
faces
arched
like
glimmering
pebbles
the
huge
dim-coloured
vault
above
his
head
he
heard
a
voice
above
the
monstrous
rustling
of
the
wheel
clamouring
calling
him
back
he
was
hastening
headlong
muttering
to
himself
his
own
flat
meaningless
name
like
a
child
repeating
as
he
runs
his
errand
and
then
as
if
in
a
charmed
cold
pool
he
awoke
and
opened
his
eyes
again
on
the
gathering
darkness
of
the
great
bedroom
and
heard
a
quick
importunate
long-continued
knocking
on
the
door
below
as
of
some
one
who
had
already
knocked
in
vain
cramped
and
heavy-limbed
he
felt
his
way
across
the
room
and
lit
a
candle
he
stood
listening
awhile
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
that
hung
a
little
open
all
in
the
room
seemed
acutely
fantastically
still
the
flame
burned
dim
misled
in
the
sluggish
air
he
stole
slowly
to
the
door
looked
out
and
again
listened
again
the
knocking
broke
out
more
impetuously
and
yet
with
a
certain
restraint
and
caution
shielding
the
flame
of
his
candle
in
the
shell
of
his
left
hand
lawford
moved
slowly
with
chin
uplifted
to
the
stairs
he
bent
forward
a
little
and
stood
motionless
and
drawn
up
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
slowly
contracting
and
expanding
as
he
gazed
down
into
the
carpeted
vacant
gloom
past
the
dim
louring
presence
that
had
fallen
back
before
him
his
mouth
opened
â€˜whoâ€™s
thereâ€™
at
last
he
called
â€˜thank
god
thank
godâ€™
he
heard
mr
bethany
mutter
â€˜i
mustnâ€™t
call
lawfordâ€™
came
a
hurried
whisper
as
if
the
old
gentleman
were
pressing
his
lips
to
speak
through
the
letter-box
â€˜come
down
and
open
the
door
thereâ€™s
a
good
fellow
iâ€™ve
been
knocking
no
end
of
a
timeâ€™
â€˜yes
i
am
comingâ€™
said
lawford
he
shut
his
mouth
and
held
his
breath
and
stair
by
stair
he
descended
driving
steadily
before
him
the
crouching
gloating
menacing
shape
darkly
lifted
up
before
him
against
the
darkness
contending
the
way
with
him
â€˜are
you
ill
are
you
hurt
has
anything
happened
lawfordâ€™
came
the
anxious
old
voice
again
striving
in
vain
to
be
restrained
â€˜no
noâ€™
muttered
lawford
â€˜i
am
coming
coming
slowlyâ€™
he
paused
to
breathe
his
hands
trembling
his
hair
lank
with
sweat
and
still
with
eyes
wide
open
he
descended
against
the
phantom
lurking
in
the
darkness--an
adversary
that
if
he
should
but
for
one
moment
close
his
lids
he
felt
would
master
sanity
and
imagination
with
its
evil
â€˜so
long
as
you
donâ€™t
get
inâ€™
he
heard
himself
muttering
â€˜so
long
as
you
donâ€™t
get
in
my
friendâ€™
â€˜whatâ€™s
that
youâ€™re
sayingâ€™
came
up
the
muffled
querulous
voice
â€˜i
canâ€™t
for
the
life
of
me
hear
my
boyâ€™
â€˜nothing
nothingâ€™
came
softly
the
answer
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
â€˜i
was
only
speaking
to
myselfâ€™
deliberately
with
candle
held
rigidly
on
a
level
with
his
eyes
lawford
pushed
forward
a
pace
or
two
into
the
airless
empty
drawing-room
and
grasped
the
handle
of
the
door
he
gazed
in
awhile
a
black
oblique
shadow
flung
across
his
face
his
eyes
fixed
like
an
animalâ€™s
then
drew
the
door
steadily
towards
him
and
suddenly
some
power
that
had
held
him
tense
seemed
to
fail
he
thrust
out
his
head
and
his
face
quivering
with
fear
and
loathing
spat
defiance
as
if
in
a
passion
of
triumph
into
the
gloom
still
muttering
he
shut
the
door
and
turned
the
key
in
another
moment
his
light
was
gleaming
out
on
the
grey
perturbed
face
and
black
narrow
shoulders
of
his
visitor
â€˜you
gave
me
quite
a
frightâ€™
said
the
old
man
almost
angrily
â€˜have
you
hurt
your
foot
or
somethingâ€™
â€˜it
was
very
darkâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜down
the
stairsâ€™
â€˜whatâ€™
said
mr
bethany
still
more
angrily
blinking
out
of
his
unspectacled
eyes
â€˜has
she
cut
off
the
gas
thenâ€™
â€˜you
got
the
noteâ€™
said
lawford
unmoved
â€˜yes
yes
i
got
the
note
goneâ€™
â€˜oh
yes
all
gone
it
was
my
choice
i
preferred
it
soâ€™
mr
bethany
sat
down
on
one
of
the
hard
old
wooden
chairs
that
stood
on
either
side
of
the
lofty
hall
and
breathing
rather
thickly
rested
his
hands
on
his
knees
â€˜whatâ€™s
happenedâ€™
he
inquired
looking
up
into
the
candle
â€˜i
forgot
my
glasses
old
fool
that
i
am
and
canâ€™t
my
dear
fellow
see
you
very
plainly
but
your
voice--â€™
â€˜i
thinkâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜i
think
itâ€™s
beginning
to
come
backâ€™
â€˜what
the
whole
thing
oh
no
my
dear
dear
man
be
frank
with
me
not
the
whole
thingâ€™
â€˜yesâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜the
whole
thing--very
very
gradually
imperceptibly
i
think
even
sheila
noticed
but
i
rather
feel
it
than
see
it
that
is
all
iâ€™m
cornering
himâ€™
â€˜himâ€™
lawford
jerked
his
candle
as
if
towards
some
definite
goal
â€˜in
timeâ€™
he
said
the
two
faces
with
the
candle
between
them
seemed
as
it
were
to
gain
light
each
from
the
other
â€˜well
wellâ€™
said
mr
bethany
â€˜every
man
for
himself
lawford
itâ€™s
the
only
way
but
whatâ€™s
going
to
be
done
we
must
be
cautious
must
think
of--of
the
othersâ€™
â€˜oh
thatâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜sheâ€™s
going
to
squeeze
me
outâ€™
â€˜youâ€™ve--squabbled
oh
but
my
dear
honest
old
honest
old
idiot
there
are
scores
of
families
here
in
this
parish
within
a
stoneâ€™s
throw
that
squabble
wrangle
all
but
politely
tear
each
otherâ€™s
eyes
out
every
day
of
their
earthly
lives
itâ€™s
perfectly
natural
where
should
we
poor
old
busybodies
be
else
peace
on
earth
we
bring
and
itâ€™s
mainly
between
husband
and
wifeâ€™
â€˜yesâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜but
you
see
this
was
not
our
earthly
life
it
was
between
usâ€™
â€˜listen
listen
to
the
dear
mysticâ€™
exclaimed
the
old
creature
scoffingly
â€˜what
depths
weâ€™re
touching
hereâ€™s
the
first
serious
break
of
his
lifetime
and
heâ€™s
gone
stark
staring
transcendental
ah
wellâ€™
he
paused
and
glanced
quickly
about
him
with
his
curious
bird-like
poise
of
head
â€˜but
youâ€™re
not
alone
hereâ€™
he
inquired
suddenly
â€˜not
absolutely
aloneâ€™
â€˜yesâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜but
thereâ€™s
plenty
to
think
about--and
read
i
havenâ€™t
thought
or
read
for
yearsâ€™
â€˜no
nor

after
thirty
my
dear
boy
one
merely
annotates
and
the
bookâ€™s
called
life
bless
me
his
solemn
old
voice
is
grinding
epigrams
out
of
even
this
poor
old
parochial
barrel-organ
you
donâ€™t
suppose
you
cannot
be
supposing
you
are
the
only
serious
person
in
the
world
whatâ€™s
more
itâ€™s
only
skin
deepâ€™
lawford
smiled
â€˜skin
deep
but
think
quietly
over
it
youâ€™ll
see
iâ€™m
doneâ€™
â€˜come
hereâ€™
said
mr
bethany
â€˜whereâ€™s
the
whiskey
whereâ€™s
the
cigars
you
shall
smoke
and
drink
and
iâ€™ll
watch
if
it
werenâ€™t
for
a
pitiful
old
stomach
iâ€™d
join
you
come
onâ€™
he
led
the
way
into
the
dining-room
he
looked
sparer
more
wizened
and
sinewy
than
ever
as
he
stooped
to
open
the
sideboard
â€˜where
on
earth
do
they
keep
everythingâ€™
he
was
muttering
to
himself
lawford
put
the
candlestick
down
on
the
table
â€˜thereâ€™s
only
one
thingâ€™
he
said
watching
his
visitorâ€™s
rummaging
â€˜what
precisely
do
you
think
they
will
do
with
meâ€™
â€˜look
here
lawfordâ€™
snapped
mr
bethany
â€˜iâ€™ve
come
round
here
hooting
through
your
letter-box
to
tally
sense
not
sentiment
why
has
your
wife
deserted
you
without
a
servant
without
a
single--itâ€™s
perfectly
monstrousâ€™
â€˜on
my
word

honour

prefer

so
i
couldnâ€™t
have
gone
on
alone
i
all
but
forget
this--this
lupus
every
turn
of
her
little
finger
reminded
me
of
it
we
are
all
of
us
alone
whether
we
know
it
or
not
you
said
so
yourself
and
itâ€™s
better
to
realize
it
stark
and
unconfused
besides
you
have
no
idea
what--what
odd
things
there
may
be

is
something
on
the
other
side
iâ€™ll
win
through
to

mr
bethany
had
been
listening
attentively
he
scrambled
up
from
his
knees
with
a
half-empty
syphon
of
sodawater
â€˜see
here
lawfordâ€™
he
said
â€˜if
you
really
want
to
know

your
most
insidious
and
most
dangerous

pray
what
is
this
â€œother
sideâ€
which
the
superior
double-faced
creatureâ€™s
going
to
win
through
to
nowâ€™
he
rapped
it
out
almost
bitterly
almost
contemptuously
lawford
hardly
heard
the
question
before
his
eyes
had
suddenly
arisen
the
peace
the
friendly
unquestioning
stillness
the
thunderous
lullaby
old
as
the
grave
â€˜itâ€™s
only
a
fancy
it
seemed
i
could
begin
againâ€™
â€˜well
look
hereâ€™
said
mr
bethany
his
whole
face
suddenly
lined
and
grey
with
age
â€˜you
canâ€™t
itâ€™s
the
one
solitary
thing
iâ€™ve
got
to
say
as
iâ€™ve
said
it
to
myself
morn
noon
and
night
these
scores
of
years
you
canâ€™t
begin
again
itâ€™s
all
a
delusion
and
a
snare
you
say
weâ€™re
alone
so
we
are
the
worldâ€™s
a
dream
a
stage
a
mirage
a
rack
call
it
what
you
will--but
you
donâ€™t
change
youâ€™re
no
illusion
thereâ€™s
no
crying
off
for
you
no
ravelling
out
no
clean
leaves
youâ€™ve
got
this--this
trouble
this
affliction--my
dear
dear
fellow
what
shall
i
say
to
tell
you
how
i
grieve
and
groan
for
you
oh
yes
and
actually
laughed
i
confess
it
a
vile
hysterical
laughter
to
think
of
it
youâ€™ve
got
this
almost
intolerable
burden
to
bear
itâ€™s
come
like
a
thief
in
the
night
but
bear
it
you
must
and
alone
they
say
deathâ€™s
a
going
to
bed
i
doubt
it
but
anyhow
lifeâ€™s
a
long
undressing
we
came
in
puling
and
naked
and
every
stitch
must
come
off
before
we
get
out
again
we
must
stand
on
our
feet
in
all
our
rabelaisian
nakedness
and
watch
the
world
fade
well
then
and
not
another
word
of
sense
shall
you
worm
out
of
my
worn-out
old
brains
after
today--all
i
say
is
donâ€™t
give
in
why
if
you
stood
here
now
freed
from
this
devilish
disguise
the
old
fat
sluggish
fellow
that
sat
and
yawned
his
head
off
under
my
eyes
in
his
pew
the
sunday
before
last
if
i
know
anything
about
human
nature
iâ€™d
say
it
to
your
face
and
a
fig
for
your
vanity
and
resignation--your
last
state
would
be
worse
than
the
first
thereâ€™
he
bunched
up
a
big
white
handkerchief
and
mopped
it
over
his
head
â€˜thatâ€™s
doneâ€™
he
said
â€˜and
we
wonâ€™t
go
back
what
i
want
to
know
now
is
what
are
you
going
to
do
where
are
you
sleeping
what
are
you
going
to
think
about
iâ€™ll
stay--yes
yes
thatâ€™s
what
it
must
be
i
must
stay
and
i
detest
strange
beds
iâ€™ll
stay
you
shanâ€™t
be
alone
do
you
hear
me
lawford--you
shanâ€™t
be
aloneâ€™
lawford
gazed
gravely
â€˜there
is
just
one
little
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
before
you
go
iâ€™ve
wormed
out
an
extraordinary
old
french
book
and--just
as
you
say--to
pass
the
time
iâ€™ve
been
having
a
shot
at
translating
it
but
iâ€™m
frightfully
rusty
itâ€™s
old
french
would
you
mind
having
a
lookâ€™
mr
bethany
blinked
and
listened
he
tried
for
the
twentieth
time
to
judge
his
friendâ€™s
eyes
to
gain
as
best
he
could
some
sustained
and
unobserved
glance
at
this
baffling
face
â€˜where
is
your
precious
french
bookâ€™
he
said
irritably
â€˜itâ€™s
upstairsâ€™
â€˜fire
away
thenâ€™
lawford
rose
and
glanced
about
the
room
â€˜what
no
light
there
eitherâ€™
snapped
mr
bethany
â€˜take
this
i
donâ€™t
mind
the
dark
thereâ€™ll
be
plenty
of
that
for
me
soonâ€™
lawford
hesitated
at
the
door
looking
rather
strangely
back
â€˜noâ€™
he
said
â€˜there
are
matches
upstairsâ€™
he
shut
the
door
after
him
the
darkness
seemed
cold
and
still
as
water
he
went
slowly
up
with
eyes
fixed
wide
on
the
floating
luminous
gloom
and
out
of
memory
seemed
to
gather
as
faintly
as
in
the
darkness
which
they
had
exorcised
for
him
the
strange
pitiful
eyes
of
the
night
before
and
as
he
mounted
a
chill
terrible
physical
peace
seemed
to
steal
over
him
mr
bethany
was
sitting
as
he
had
left
him
looking
steadily
on
the
floor
when
lawford
returned
he
flattened
out
the
book
on
the
table
with
a
sniff
of
impatience
and
dragging
the
candle
nearer
and
stooping
his
nose
close
to
the
fusty
print
he
began
to
read
â€˜was
this
in
the
houseâ€™
he
inquired
presently
â€˜noâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜it
was
lent
to
me
by
a
friend--herbertâ€™
â€˜hâ€™m
donâ€™t
know
him
anyhow
precious
poor
stuff
this
is
this
sabathier
whoever
he
is
seems
to
be
a
kind
of
clap-trap
eighteenth-century
adventurer
who
thought
the
world
would
be
better
off
apparently
for
a
long
account
of
all
his
sentimental
amours
rousseau
with
a
touch
of
don
quixote
in
his
composition
and
an
echo
of
that
prince
of
bogies
poe
what
in
the
name
of
wonder
induced
you
to
fix
on
this
for
your
holiday
readingâ€™
â€˜sabathierâ€™s
alive
isnâ€™t
heâ€™
â€˜i
never
said
he
wasnâ€™t
heâ€™s
a
good
deal
too
much
alive
for
my
old
wits
with
his
mamâ€™selle
this
and
madame
the
other
interesting
enough
perhaps
for
the
professional
literary
nose
with
a
taste
for
patchouliâ€™
â€˜yet
i
suppose
even
that
is
not
a
very
rare
characterâ€™
mr
bethany
peered
up
from
the
dingy
book
at
his
ingenuous
questioner
â€˜i
should
say
decidedly
that
the
fellow
was
a
very
rare
character
so
long
as
by
rare
you
donâ€™t
mean
good
itâ€™s
one
of
the
dullest
stupidities
of
the
present
day
my
dear
fellow
to
dote
on
a
man
simply
because
heâ€™s
different
from
the
rest
of
us
once
a
man
strays
out
of
the
common
herd
heâ€™s
more
likely
to
meet
wolves
in
the
thickets
than
angels
from
what
i
can
gather
in
just
these
few
pages
this
sabathier
appears
to
have
been
an
amorous
adventurous
emotional
frenchman
who
went
to
the
dogs
as
easily
and
as
rapidly
as
his
own
nature
and
his
period
allowed
and
i
should
say
lawford
that
he
made
precious
bad
reading
for
a
poor
old
troubled
hermit
like
yourself
at
the
present
momentâ€™
â€˜thereâ€™s
a
portrait
of
him
a
few
pages
backâ€™
mr
bethany
with
some
little
impatience
turned
back
to
the
engraving
â€˜â€œnicholas
de
sabathierâ€â€™s
he
muttered
â€˜â€œdeâ€
indeedâ€™
he
poked
in
at
the
foxy
print
with
narrowed
eyes
â€˜i
donâ€™t
deny
itâ€™s
a
striking
even
perhaps
a
rather
taking
face
i
donâ€™t
deny
itâ€™
he
gazed
on
with
an
even
more
acute
concentration
and
looked
up
sharply
â€˜look
here
lawford
what
in
the
name
of
wonder--what
trick
are
you
playing
on
me
nowâ€™
â€˜trickâ€™
said
lawford
and
the
world
fell
with
the
tiniest
plash
in
the
silence
like
a
vivid
little
float
upon
the
surface
of
a
shadowy
pool
the
old
face
flushed
â€˜what
conceivable
bearing
i
say
has
this
dead
and
gone
old
roue
on
us
nowâ€™
â€˜you
donâ€™t
think
then
you
see
any
resemblance--any
resemblance
at
allâ€™
â€˜resemblanceâ€™
repeated
mr
bethany
in
a
flat
voice
and
without
raising
his
face
again
to
meet
lawfordâ€™s
direct
scrutiny
â€˜resemblance
to
whomâ€™
â€˜to
me
to
me
as
i
amâ€™
â€˜but
even
my
dear
fellow
forgive
my
dull
old
brains
even
if
there
was
just
the
faintest
superficial
suggestion
of--of
that
what
thenâ€™
â€˜whyâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜heâ€™s
buried
in
widderstoneâ€™
â€˜buried
in
widderstoneâ€™
the
keen
childlike
blue
eyes
looked
almost
stealthily
up
across
the
book
the
old
man
sat
without
speaking
so
still
that
it
might
even
be
supposed
he
himself
was
listening
for
a
quiet
distant
footfall
â€˜he
is
buried
in
the
grave
beside
which
i
fell
asleepâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜all
green
and
still
and
brokenâ€™
he
added
faintly
â€˜you
rememberâ€™
he
went
on
in
a
repressed
voice--â€˜you
remember
you
asked
me
if
there
was
anybody
else
in
sight
any
eavesdropper
you
donâ€™t
think--himâ€™
mr
bethany
pushed
the
book
a
few
inches
away
from
him
â€˜who
did
you
say--who
was
it
you
said
put
the
thing
into
your
head
a
queer
friend
surelyâ€™
he
paused
helplessly
â€˜and
how
pray
do
you
knowâ€™
he
began
again
more
firmly
â€˜even
if
there
is
a
sabathier
buried
at
widderstone
how
do
you
know
it
is
this
sabathier
itâ€™s
not
i
thinkâ€™
he
added
boldly
â€˜a
very
uncommon
name
with
two
bâ€™s
at
any
rate
whereabouts
is
the
graveâ€™
â€˜quite
down
at
the
bottom
under
the
trees
and
the
little
seat
i
told
you
of
is
there
too
where
i
fell
asleep
you
seeâ€™
he
explained
â€˜the
graveâ€™s
almost
isolated
i
suppose
because
he
killed
himselfâ€™
mr
bethany
clasped
his
knuckled
fingers
on
the
tablecloth
â€˜itâ€™s
no
goodâ€™
he
concluded
after
a
long
pause
â€˜the
fellowâ€™s
got
up
into
my
head
i
canâ€™t
think
him
out
we
must
thrash
it
out
quietly
in
the
morning
with
the
blessed
sun
at
the
window
not
this
farthing
dip
to
me
the
whole
idea
is
as
revolting
as
it
is
incredible
why
above
a
century--no
no
and
on
the
other
hand
how
easily
oneâ€™s
fancy
builds
a
few
straws
and
thereâ€™s
a
nest
and
squawking
fledglings
all
complete
is
that
why--is
that
why
that
good
practical
wife
of
yours
and
all
your
faithful
household
have
absconded
does
itâ€™--he
threw
up
his
head
as
if
towards
the
house
above
them--â€˜does
it
reek
with
himâ€™
lawford
shook
his
head
â€˜she
hasnâ€™t
seen
him
not--not
apart
i
havenâ€™t
told
herâ€™
mr
bethany
tossed
the
hugger-mugger
of
pamphlets
across
the
table
â€˜then
for
simple
sanityâ€™s
sake
donâ€™t
hide
it
burn
it
put
the
thing
completely
out
of
your
mind
a
friend
who
where
is
this
wonderful
friendâ€™
â€˜not
very
far
from
widderstone
he
lives--practically
aloneâ€™
â€˜and
all
that
stumbling
and
muttering
on
the
stairsâ€™
he
leant
forward
almost
threateningly
â€˜there
isnâ€™t
anybody
here
lawfordâ€™
â€˜oh
noâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜we
are
practically
alone
with
this
you
knowâ€™
he
pointed
to
the
book
and
smiled
frankly
however
faintly
again
mr
bethany
sank
into
a
fixed
yet
uneasy
reverie
and
again
shook
himself
and
raised
his
eyes
â€˜well
thenâ€™
he
said
in
a
voice
all
but
morose
in
its
fretfullness
â€˜what
i
suggest
is
that
first
you
keep
quiet
here
and
next
that
you
write
and
get
your
wife
back
you
say
you
are
better
i
think
you
said
she
herself
noticed
a
slight
improvement
isnâ€™t
it
just
exactly
as
i
foresaw
and
yet
sheâ€™s
gone
but
thatâ€™s
not
our
business
get
her
back
and
donâ€™t
for
a
single
instant
waste
a
thought
on
the
other
not
for
a
single
instant
i
implore
you
lawford
and
in
a
week
the
whole
thing
will
be
no
more
than
a
dreary
preposterous
dream
you
donâ€™t
answer
meâ€™
he
cried
impulsively
â€˜but
can
one
so
easily
forget
a
dream
like
thisâ€™
â€˜you
donâ€™t
speak
out
lawford
you
mean
she
wonâ€™tâ€™
â€˜it
must
at
least
seem
to
have
been
in
part
of
my
own
seeking
or
contriving
or
at
any
rate--she
said
it--of
my
own
hereditary
or
unconscious
deservingâ€™
â€˜she
said
thatâ€™
mr
bethany
sat
back
â€˜i
see
i
seeâ€™
he
said
â€˜iâ€™m
nothing
but
a
fumbling
old
meddler
and
there
was
i
not
ten
minutes
ago
preaching
for
all
i
was
worth
on
a
text
i
knew
nothing
about
god
bless
me
lawford
how
long
we
take
a-learning
iâ€™ll
say
no
more
but
what
an
illusion
to
think
this--this--he
laid
a
long
lean
hand
at
armâ€™s
length
flat
upon
the
table
towards
his
friend--â€˜to
think
this
is
our
old
jog-trot
arthur
lawford

henceforth
i
throw
you
over
you
old
wolf
in
sheepâ€™s
wool
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
and
now
where
am
i
going
to
sleepâ€™
he
covered
up
his
age
and
weariness
for
an
instant
with
a
small
crooked
hand
lawford
took
a
deep
breath
â€˜youâ€™re
going
old
friend
to
sleep
at
home
and
i--iâ€™m
going
to
give
you
my
arm
to
the
vicarage
gate
here
i
am
immeasurably
relieved
fitter
than
iâ€™ve
been
since
i
was
a
dolt
of
a
schoolboy
on
my
word
of
honour
i
canâ€™t
say
why
but
i
am
i
donâ€™t
care
that
vicar
honestly--puffed
up
with
spiritual
pride
if
a
man
canâ€™t
sleep
with
pride
for
a
bed-fellow
well
heâ€™d
better
try
elsewhere
itâ€™s
no
good
iâ€™m
as
stubborn
as
a
mule
thatâ€™s
at
least
a
relic
of
the
old
adam
i
care
no
moreâ€™
he
raised
his
voice
firmly
and
gravely--â€˜i
donâ€™t
care
a
jot
for
solitude
not
a
jot
for
all
the
ghosts
of
all
the
catacombsâ€™
mr
bethany
listened
grimly
pursed
up
his
lips
â€˜not
a
jot
for
all
the
ghosts
of
all
the
catechismsâ€™
he
muttered
nor
the
devil
himself
i
supposeâ€™
he
turned
once
more
to
glance
sharply
in
the
direction
of
the
face
he
could
so
dimly--and
of
set
purpose--discern
and
without
a
word
trotted
off
into
the
hall
lawford
followed
with
the
candle
â€˜â€™pon
my
word

â€˜not

said
mr

â€˜if
you
wonâ€™t
have

go

encourage

miserable
grass-widowering

would
the
busybodies
say
ghouls
and
graves
and
shocking
mysteries--selina
sister

he
shuffled
on
his
hat
and
caught
firm
hold
of
his
knobbed
umbrella
â€˜better
not
leave
a
candleâ€™
he
said
lawford
blew
out
the
candle
â€˜what
whatâ€™
called
the
old
man
suddenly
but
no
voice
had
spoken
a
thin
trickle
of
light
from
the
lamp
in
the
street
stuck
up
through
the
fanlight
as
with
a
smile
that
could
be
described
neither
as
mischievous
saturnine
nor
vindictive
and
was
yet
faintly
suggestive
of
all
three
lawford
quietly
opened
the
drawing-room
door
and
put
down
the
candlestick
on
the
floor
within
â€˜what
on
earth
my
good
man
are
you
fumbling
after
nowâ€™
came
the
almost
fretful
question
from
under
the
echoing
porch
â€˜coming
comingâ€™
said
lawford
and
slammed
the
door
behind
them
the
first
faint
streaks
of
dawn
were
silvering
across
the
stars
when
lawford
again
let
himself
into
his
deserted
house
he
stumbled
down
to
the
pantry
and
cut
himself
a
crust
of
bread
and
cheese
and
ate
it
sitting
on
the
table
watching
the
leafy
eastern
sky
through
the
painted
bars
of
the
area
window
he
munched
on
hungry
and
tired
his
night
walk
had
cooled
head
and
heart
having
obstinately
refused
mr
bethanyâ€™s
invitation
to
sleep
at
the
vicarage
he
had
sat
down
on
an
old
low
wall
and
watched
until
his
light
had
shone
out
at
his
bedroom
window
then
he
had
simply
wandered
on
past
rustling
glimmering
gardens
under
the
great
timbers
of
yellowing
elms
hardly
thinking
hardly
aware
of
himself
except
as
in
a
far-away
vision
of
a
sluggish
insignificant
creature
struggling
across
the
tossed-up
crust
of
an
old
incomprehensible
world
the
secret
of
his
content
in
that
long
leisurely
ramble
had
been
that
repeatedly
by
a
scarcely
realised
effort
it
had
not
lain
in
the
direction
of
widderstone
and
now
as
he
sat
hungrily
devouring
his
breakfast
on
the
table
in
the
kitchen
with
the
daybreak
comforting
his
eyes
he
thought
with
a
positive
mockery
of
that
poor
old
night-thing
he
had
given
inch
by
inch
into
the
safe
keeping
of
his
pink
and
white
drawing-room
don
quixote
poe
rousseau--they
were
familiar
but
not
very
significant
labels
to
a
mind
that
had
found
very
poor
entertainment
in
reading
but
they
were
at
least
representative
enough
to
set
him
wondering
which
of
their
influences
it
was
that
had
inflated
with
such
a
gaseous
heroism
the
lawford
of
the
night
before
he
thought
of
sheila
with
a
not
unkindly
smile
and
of
the
rest
â€˜i
wonder
what
theyâ€™ll
doâ€™
had
been
a
question
almost
as
much
in
his
mind
during
these
last
few
hours
as
had
â€˜what
am
i
to
doâ€™
in
the
first
bout
of
his
â€˜visitationâ€™
but
the
â€˜theyâ€™
was
not
very
precisely
visualised
he
saw
sheila
and
harry
and
dainty
pale-blue
bettie
lovat
and
cautious
old
wedderburn
and
danton
and
craik
and
cheery
gossipy
dr
sutherland
and
the
verger
mr
dutton
and
critchett
and
the
gardener
and
ada
and
the
whole
vague
populous
host
that
keep
one
as
definitely
in
oneâ€™s
place
in
the
worldâ€™s
economy
as
a
firm-set
pin
the
camphored
moth
what
his
place
was
to
be
only
time
could
show
meanwhile
there
was
in
this
loneliness
at
least
a
respite
solitude--he
bathed
his
weary
bones
in
it
he
laved
his
eyelids
in
it
as
in
a
woodland
brook
after
the
heat
of
noon
he
sat
on
in
calmest
reverie
till
his
hunger
was
satisfied
then
scattering
out
his
last
crumbs
to
the
birds
from
the
barred
window
he
climbed
upstairs
again
past
his
usual
bedroom
past
his
detested
guest
room
up
into
the
narrow
sweetness
of
aliceâ€™s
and
flinging
himself
on
her
bed
fell
into
a
long
and
dreamless
sleep
by
ten
next
morning
lawford
had
bathed
and
dressed
and
at
half-past
ten
he
got
up
from
sheilaâ€™s
fat
little
french
dictionary
and
his
memoirs
to
answer
mrs
gullâ€™s
summons
on
the
area
bell
the
little
woman
stood
with
arms
folded
over
an
empty
and
capacious
bag
with
an
air
of
sustained
melancholy
on
her
friendly
face
she
wished
him
a
very
nervous
â€˜good
morningâ€™
and
dived
down
into
the
kitchen
the
hours
dragged
slowly
by
in
a
silence
broken
only
by
an
occasional
ring
at
the
bell
about
three
she
emerged
from
the
house
and
climbed
the
area
steps
with
her
bag
hooked
over
her
arm
he
watched
the
little
black
figure
out
of
sight
watched
a
man
in
a
white
canvas
hat
ascend
the
steps
to
push
a
blue-printed
circular
through
the
letter-box
it
had
begun
to
rain
a
little
he
returned
to
the
breakfast-room
and
with
the
window
wide
open
to
the
rustling
coolness
of
the
leaves
edged
his
way
very
slowly
across
from
line
to
line
of
the
obscure
french
print
sabathier
none
the
less
and
in
spite
of
his
unintelligible
literariness
did
begin
to
take
shape
and
consistency
the
man
himself
breathing
and
thinking
began
to
live
for
lawford
even
in
those
few
half-articulate
pages
though
not
in
quite
so
formidable
a
fashion
as
mr
bethany
had
summed
him
up
but
as
the
west
began
to
lighten
with
the
declining
sun
the
same
old
disquietude
the
same
old
friendless
and
foreboding
ennui
stole
over
lawfordâ€™s
solitude
once
more
he
shut
his
books
placed
a
candlestick
and
two
boxes
of
matches
on
the
hall
table
lit
a
bead
of
gas
and
went
out
into
the
rainy-sweet
streets
again
at
a
mean
little
barberâ€™s
with
a
pole
above
his
lettered
door
he
went
in
to
be
shaved
and
a
few
steps
further
on
he
sat
down
at
the
crumb-littered
counter
of
a
little
bakerâ€™s
shop
to
have
some
tea
it
pleased
him
almost
to
childishness
to
find
how
easily
he
could
listen
and
even
talk
to
the
oiled
and
crimpy
little
barber
and
to
the
pretty
consumptive-looking
print-dressed
bakerâ€™s
wife
whatever
his
face
might
now
be
conniving
at
the
arthur
lawford
of
last
week
could
never
have
hob-nobbed
so
affably
with
his
social
â€˜inferiorsâ€™
for
no
reason
in
the
world
unless
to
spend
a
moment
or
two
longer
in
the
friendly
bakerâ€™s
shop
he
bought
six-penny-worth
of
cakes
he
watched
them
as
they
were
deposited
one
by
one
in
the
bag
and
even
asked
for
one
sort
to
be
exchanged
for
another
flushing
a
little
at
the
pretty
compliment
he
had
ventured
on
he
climbed
out
of
the
shop
and
paused
on
the
wooden
doorstep
â€˜do
you
happen
to
know
mr
herbert
herbertâ€™sâ€™
he
said
the
bakerâ€™s
wife
glanced
up
at
him
with
clear
reflective
eyes
â€˜mr
herbertâ€™s--that
must
be
some
little
way
off
sir
i
donâ€™t
know
any
such
name
and
i
know
most
just
round
about
likeâ€™
â€˜well
yes
it
isâ€™
said
lawford
rather
foolishly
â€˜i
hardly
know
why
i
asked
itâ€™s
past
the
churchyard
at
widderstoneâ€™
â€˜oh
yes
sirâ€™
she
encouraged
him
â€˜a
big
wooden-looking
houseâ€™
â€˜really
sir
woodenâ€™
lawford
looked
into
her
face
but
could
find
nothing
more
to
say
so
he
smiled
again
rather
absently
and
ascended
into
the
street
he
sat
down
outside
the
churchyard
gate
on
the
very
bank
where
he
had
in
the
sourness
of
the
nettles
first
opened
sabathierâ€™s
memoirs
the
world
lay
still
beneath
the
pale
sky
presently
the
little
fat
rector
walked
up
the
hill
his
wrists
still
showing
beneath
his
sleeves
lawford
meditatively
watched
him
pass
by
a
small
boy
with
a
switch
a
tiny
nose
and
a
swinging
gallipot
his
cheeks
lit
with
the
sunset
followed
soon
after
lawford
beckoned
him
with
his
finger
and
held
out
the
bag
of
tarts
he
watched
him
half
incredulous
of
his
prize
and
with
many
a
cautious
look
over
his
shoulder
pass
out
of
sight
for
a
long
while
he
sat
alone
only
the
evening
birds
singing
out
of
the
greenness
and
silence
of
the
churchyard
what
a
haunting
inescapable
riddle
life
was
colour
suddenly
faded
out
of
the
light
streaming
between
the
branches
and
depression
always
lying
in
ambush
of
the
novelty
of
his
freedom
began
like
mist
to
rise
above
his
restless
thoughts
it
was
all
so
devilish
empty--this
raft
of
the
world
floating
under
eveningâ€™s
shadow
how
many
sermons
had
he
listened
to
enriched
with
the
simile
of
the
ocean
of
life
here
they
were
come
home
to
roost
he
had
fallen
asleep
ineffectual
sailor
that
he
was
and
a
thief
out
of
the
cloudy
deep
had
stolen
oar
and
sail
and
compass
leaving
him
adrift
amid
the
riding
of
the
waves
â€˜are
they
worth
do
you
think
quite
a
pennyâ€™
suddenly
inquired
a
quiet
voice
in
the
silence
he
looked
up
into
the
almost
colourless
face
into
the
grey
eyes
beneath
their
clear
narrow
brows
â€˜i
was
thinkingâ€™
he
said
â€˜what
a
curious
thing
life
is
and
wondering--â€™
â€˜the
first
half
is
well
worth
the
penny--its
originality
i
canâ€™t
afford
twopence
so
you
must
give
me
what
you
were
wonderingâ€™
lawford
gazed
rather
blankly
across
the
twilight
fields
â€˜i
was
wonderingâ€™
he
said
with
an
oddly
naive
candour
â€˜how
long
it
took
one
to
sinkâ€™
â€˜they
say
you
knowâ€™
grisel
replied
solemnly
â€˜drowned
sailors
float
midway
suffering
their
sea
change
purgatory
but
what
a
splendid
pennyworth
all
pure
philosophyâ€™
â€˜â€œphilosophyâ€â€™
said
lawford
â€˜i
am
a
perfect
fool
has
your
brother
told
you
about
meâ€™
she
glanced
at
him
quickly
â€˜we
had
a
talkâ€™
â€˜then
you
do
know--â€™
he
stopped
dead
and
turned
to
her
â€˜you
really
realise
it
looking
at
me
nowâ€™
â€˜i
realiseâ€™
she
said
gravely
â€˜that
you
look
even
a
little
more
pale
and
haggard
than
when
i
saw
you
first
the
other
night
we
both
my
brother
and
i
you
know
thought
for
certain
youâ€™d
come
yesterday
in
fact
i
went
into
the
widderstone
in
the
evening
to
look
for
you
knowing
your
nocturnal
habitsâ€™
she
glanced
again
at
him
with
a
kind
of
shy
anxiety
â€˜why--why
is
your
brother
so--why
does
he
let
me
bore
him
so
horriblyâ€™
â€˜does
he
heâ€™s
tremendously
interested
but
then
heâ€™s
pretty
easily
interested
when
heâ€™s
interested
at
all
if
he
can
possibly
twist
anything
into
the
slightest
show
of
a
mystery
he
will
but
of
course
you
wonâ€™t
you
canâ€™t
take
all
he
says
seriously
the
tiniest
pinch
of
salt
you
know
heâ€™s
an
absolute
fanatic
at
talking
in
the
air
besides
it
doesnâ€™t
really
matter
muchâ€™
â€˜in
the
airâ€™
â€˜i
mean
if
once
a
theory
gets
into
his
head--the
more
far-fetched
so
long
as
itâ€™s
original
the
better--it
flowers
out
into
a
positive
miracle
of
incredibilities
and
of
course
you
can
rout
out
evidence
for
anything
under
the
sun
from
his
dingy
old
folios
why
did
he
lend
you
that
particular
bookâ€™
â€˜didnâ€™t
he
tell
you
that
thenâ€™
â€˜he
said
it
was
sabathierâ€™
she
seemed
to
think
intensely
for
the
merest
fraction
of
a
moment
and
turned
â€˜honestly
though
i
think
he
immensely
exaggerated
the
likeness
as
forâ€™
he
touched
her
arm
and
they
stopped
again
face
to
face
â€˜tell
me
what
difference
exactly
you
seeâ€™
he
said
â€˜i
am
quite
myself
again
now
honestly
please
tell
me
just
the
very
worst
you
thinkâ€™
â€˜i
think
to
begin
withâ€™
she
began
with
exaggerated
candour
â€˜his
is
rather
a
detestable
faceâ€™
â€˜and
mineâ€™
he
said
gravely
â€˜why--very
troubled
oh
yes--but
his
was
like
some
bird
of
prey
yours--what
mad
stuff
to
talk
like
this--not
the
least
symptom
that
i
can
see
of--why
the
â€œpreyâ€
you
knowâ€™
they
had
come
to
the
wicket
in
the
dark
thorny
hedge
â€˜would
it
be
very
dreadful
to
walk
on
a
little--just
to
finishâ€™
â€˜veryâ€™
she
said
turning
as
gravely
at
his
side
â€˜what
i
wanted
to
say
was--â€™
began
lawford
and
forgetting
altogether
the
thread
by
which
he
hoped
to
lead
up
to
what
he
really
wanted
to
say
broke
off
lamely
â€˜i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
absolutely
despised
a
cowardâ€™
â€˜it
would
be
rather
absurd
to
despise
what
one
so
horribly
well
understands
besides
we
werenâ€™t
cowards--we
werenâ€™t
cowards
a
bit
my
childhood
was
one
long
reiterated
terror--nights
and
nights
of
it
but
i
never
had
the
pluck
to
tell
any
one
no
one
so
much
as
dreamt
of
the
company
i
had
ah
and
you
didnâ€™t
see
either
that
my
heart
was
absolutely
in
my
mouth
that
i
was
shrivelled
up
with
fear
even
at
sight
of
the
fear
on
your
face
in
the
dark
thereâ€™s
absolutely
nothing
so
catching
so
you
see
i
do
know
a
little
what
nerves
are
and
dream
too
sometimes
though
i
donâ€™t
choose
charnelhouses
if
i
can
get
a
comfortable
bed
a
coward
may
i
really
say
that
to
ask
my
help
was
one
of
the
bravest
things
in
a
man
i
ever
heard
of
bullets--that
kind
of
courage--no
real
woman
cares
twopence
for
bullets
an
old
aunt
of
mine
stared
a
man
right
out
of
the
house
with
the
thing
in
her
face
anyhow
whether
i
may
or
not
i
do
say
it
so
now
we
are
quitsâ€™
â€˜will
you--â€™
began
lawford
and
stopped
â€˜what
i
wanted
to
say
wasâ€™
he
jerked
on
â€˜it
is
sheer
horrible
hypocrisy
to
be
talking
to
you
like
this--though
you
will
never
have
the
faintest
idea
of
what
it
has
meant
and
done
for
me
i
mean
and
yet
and
yet
i
do
feel
when
just
for
the
least
moment
i
forget
what
i
am
and
that
isnâ€™t
very
often
when
i
forget
what
i
have
become
and
what
i
must
go
back
to--i
feel
that
i
havenâ€™t
any
business
to
be
talking
with
you
at
all
â€œquitsâ€
and
here
i
am
an
outcast
from
decent
society
ah
you
donâ€™t
know--â€™
she
bent
her
head
and
laughed
under
her
breath
â€˜you
do
really
stumble
on
such
delicious
compliments
and
yet
do
you
know
i
think
my
brother
would
be
immensely
pleased
to
think
you
were
an
outcast
from
decent
society
if
only
he
could
be
thought
one
too
he
has
been
trying
half
his
life
to
wither
decent
society
with
neglect
and
disdain--but
it
doesnâ€™t
take
the
least
notice
the
deaf
adder
you
know
besides
besides
what
is
all
this
meek
talk
i
detest
meek
talk--gods
or
men
surely
in
the
first
and
last
resort
all
we
are
is
ourselves
something
has
happened
you
are
jangled
shaken
but
to
us
believe
me
you
are
simply
one
of
fewer
friends-and
i
think
after
struggling
up
widderstone
lane
hand
in
hand
with
you
in
the
dark
i
have
a
right
to
say
â€œfriendsâ€
than
i
could
count
on
one
hand
what
are
we
all
if
we
only
realized
it
we
talk
of
dignity
and
propriety
and
we
are
like
so

children
playing
with
knucklebones
in
a
giantâ€™s
scullery
come
along
he
will
some
suppertime
for
us
each
in
turn--and
how
many
even
will
so
much
as
look
up
from
their
play
to
wave
us
good-bye
thatâ€™s
what
i
mean--the
plot
of
silence
we
are
all
in
if
only
i
had
my
brotherâ€™s
lucidity
how
much
better
i
would
have
said
all
this
it
is
only
believe
me
that
i
want
ever
so
much
to
help
you
if
i
may--even
at
risk
tooâ€™
she
added
rather
shakily
â€˜of
having
that
help--well--i
know
itâ€™s
little
goodâ€™
the
lane
had
narrowed
they
had
climbed
the
arch
of
a
narrow
stone
bridge
that
spanned
the
smooth
dark
widder
a
few
late
starlings
were
winging
far
above
them
darkness
was
coming
on
apace
they
stood
for
awhile
looking
down
into
the
black
flowing
water
with
here
and
there
the
mild
silver
of
a
star
dim
leagues
below
â€˜i
am
afraidâ€™
said
grisel
looking
quietly
up
â€˜you
have
led
me
into
talking
most
pitiless
nonsense

last
night

never

â€˜thinking

at

strawâ€™
the
grey
eyes
questioned
him
â€˜you

he
explained
in
a
whisper
as
if
afraid
of
being
overheard
â€˜it--it
came
back
again
and--i
donâ€™t
mind
a
bit
how
much
you
laugh
at
me
i
had
been
asleep
and
had
had
a
most
awful
dream
one
of
those
dreams
that
seem
to
hint
that
some
day
that
will
be
our
real
world
that
some
day
we
may
awake

dreaming
then
will
be
of

i
woke--came
back--and
there
was
a
tremendous
knocking
going
on
downstairs

knew
there
was
no
one

in
the
house--â€™
â€˜no

â€˜yesâ€™
said
lawford
stolidly
â€˜they

all
out

he
went
on
quickly
â€˜there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
simply
to
go
down
and
open
the
door
and
yet
do
you
know
at
first
i
simply
couldnâ€™t
move
i
lit
a
candle
and
then--then
somehow
i
got
to
know
that
waiting
for
me
was
just--but
thereâ€™
he
broke
off
half-ashamed
â€˜i
mustnâ€™t
bother
you
with
all
this
morbid
stuff
will
your
brother
be
in
now
do
you
thinkâ€™
â€˜my
brother
will
be
in
and
of
course
expecting
you
but
as
for
â€œbotherâ€
believe
me--well
did
i
quite
deserve
itâ€™
she
stooped
towards
him
â€˜you
lit
a
candle--and
thenâ€™
they
turned
and
retraced
their
way
slowly
up
the
hill
â€˜it
came
againâ€™
â€˜itâ€™
â€˜that--that
presence
that
shadow
i
donâ€™t
mean
of
course
itâ€™s
a
real
shadow
it
comes
doesnâ€™t
it
from--from
within
as
if
from
out
of
some
unheard-of
hiding
place
where
it
has
been
lurking
for
ages
and
ages
before
oneâ€™s
childhood
at
least
so
it
seems
to
me
now
and
yet
although
it
does
come
from
within
there
it
is
too
in
front
of
you
before
your
eyes
feeding
even
on
your
fear
just
watching
waiting
for--what
nonsense
all
this
must
seem
to
youâ€™
â€˜yes
yes
and
thenâ€™
â€˜then
and
you
must
remember
the
poor
old
boy
had
been
knocking
all
this
time--my
old
friend--mr
bethany
i
mean--knocking
and
calling
through
the
letter-box
thinking
i
was
in
extremis
or
something
then--how
shall
i
describe
it--well
you
came
your
eyes
your
face
as
clear
as
when
you
know
the
night
before
last
we
went
up
the
hill
together
and
thenâ€™
â€˜and
thenâ€™
â€˜and
then
we--you
and
i
you
know--simply
drove
him
downstairs
and
i
could
hear
myself
grunting
as
if
it
was
really
a
physical
effort
we
drove
him
step
by
step
downstairs
and--â€™
he
laughed
outright
and
boyishly
continued
his
adventure
â€˜what
do
you
think
i
did
then
without
the
ghost
of
a
smile
too
at
the
idiocy
of
the
thing
i
locked
the
poor
beggar
in
the
drawing-room
i
saw
him
there
as
plainly
as
i
ever
saw
anything
in
my
life
and
the
furniture
glimmering
though
it
was
pitch
dark
i
canâ€™t
describe
it
it
all
seemed
so
desperately
real
absolutely
vital
then
it
all
seems
so
meaningless
and
impossible
now
and
yet
although
i
am
utterly
played
out
and
done
for
and
however
absurd
it
may
sound
i
wouldnâ€™t
have
lost
it
i
wouldnâ€™t
go
back
for
any
bribe
there
is
i
feel
just
as
if
a
great
bundle
had
been
rolled
off
my
back
of
course
the
queerest
the
most
detestable
part
of
the
whole
business
is
that
it--the
thing
on
the
stairs--was
thisâ€™--he
lifted
a
grave
and
haggard
face
towards
her
again--â€˜or
rather
thatâ€™
he
pointed
with
his
stick
towards
the
starry
churchyard
â€˜sabathierâ€™
he
said
again
they
had
paused
together
before
the
white
gate
and
this
time
lawford
pushed
it
open
and
followed
his
companion
up
the
narrow
path
she
stayed
a
moment
her
hand
on
the
bell
â€˜was
it
my
brother
who
actually
put
that
horrible
idea
into
your
mind--about
sabathierâ€™
â€˜oh
no
not
really
put
it
into
my
headâ€™
said
lawford
hollowly
â€˜he
only
found
it
there
lit
it
upâ€™
she
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
his
arm
â€˜whether
he
did
or
notâ€™
she
said
with
an
earnestness
that
was
almost
an
entreaty
â€˜of
course
you
must
agree
that
we
every
one
of
us
have
some
such
experience--that
kind
of
visitor
once
at
least
in
a
lifetimeâ€™
â€˜ah
butâ€™
began
lawford
turning
forlornly
away
â€˜you
didnâ€™t
see
you
canâ€™t
have
realized--the
changeâ€™
she
pulled
the
bell
almost
as
if
in
some
inward
triumph
â€˜but
donâ€™t
you
thinkâ€™
she
suggested
â€˜that
that
like
the
other
might
be
as
it
were
partly
imagination
too
if
now
you
thought
backâ€™
but
a
little
old
woman
had
opened
the
door
and
the
sentence
for
the
moment
was
left
unfinished
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
and
no
light
when
they
entered
for
a
moment
grisel
stood
by
the
open
window
looking
out
then
she
turned
impulsively
â€˜my
brother
of
course
will
ask
you
tooâ€™
she
said
â€˜we
had
made
up
our
minds
to
do
so
if
you
came
again
but
i
want
you
to
promise
me
now
that
you
wonâ€™t
dream
of
going
back
to-night
that
surely
would
be
tempting--well
not
providence
i
couldnâ€™t
rest
if
i
thought
you
might
be
alone
like
that
againâ€™
her
voice
died
away
into
the
calling
of
the
waters
a
light
moved
across
the
dingy
old
rows
of
books
and
as
his
sister
turned
to
go
out
herbert
appeared
in
the
doorway
carrying
a
green-shaded
lamp
with
an
old
leather
quarto
under
his
arm
â€˜ah
here
you
areâ€™
he
said
â€˜i
guessed
you
had
probably
metâ€™
he
drew
up
burdened
before
his
visitor
but
his
clear
black
glance
instead
of
wandering
off
at
his
first
greeting
had
intensified
and
it
was
almost
with
an
air
of
absorption
that
he
turned
away
he
dumped
his
book
on
to
a
chair
and
it
turned
over
with
scattered
leaves
on
to
the
floor
he
put
the
lamp
down
and
stooped
after
it
so
that
his
next
words
came
up
muffled
and
as
if
the
remark
had
been
forced
out
of
him
â€˜you
donâ€™t
feel
worse
i
hopeâ€™
he
got
up
and
faced
his
visitor
for
the
answer
and
for
the
moment
lawford
stood
considering
his
symptoms
â€˜noâ€™
he
said
almost
gaily
â€˜i
feel
enormously
betterâ€™
but
herbertâ€™s
long
oval
questioning
eyes
beneath
the
sleek
black
hair
were
still
fixed
on
his
face
â€˜i
am
afraid
my
dear
fellowâ€™
he
said
with
something
more
than
his
usual
curiously
indifferent
courtesy
â€˜the
struggle
has
frightfully
pulled
you
to
piecesâ€™
â€˜the
question
isâ€™
answered
lawford
with
a
kind
of
tired
yet
whimsical
melancholy
in
his
voice
â€˜though
i
am
not
sure
that
the
answer
very
much
matters--whatâ€™s
going
to
put
me
together
again
itâ€™s
the
old
story
of
humpty
dumpty
herbert
besides
one
thing
you
said
has
stuck
out
in
a
quite
curious
way
in
my
memory
i
wonder
if
you
will
rememberâ€™
â€˜what
was
thatâ€™
said
herbert
with
unfeigned
curiosity
â€˜why
you
said
even
though
sabathier
had
failed
though
i
was
still
my
own
old
stodgy
self
that
you
thought
the
face--the
face
you
know
might
work
in
somehow
sometimes
i
think
it
has
it
does
really
rather
haunt
me
in
that
case--well
what
thenâ€™
lawford
had
himself
listened
to
this
involved
explanation
much
as
one
watches
the
accomplishment
of
a
difficult
trick
marvelling
more
at
its
completion
at
all
than
at
the
difficulty
involved
in
the
doing
of
it
â€˜â€œwork
inâ€â€™
repeated
herbert
like
a
rather
blase
child
confronted
with
a
new
mechanical
toy
â€˜did
i
really
say
that
well
honestly
it
wasnâ€™t
bad
itâ€™s
what
one
would
expect
on
that
hypothesis
you
see
we
are
only
different
as
it
were
in
our
differences
once
the
footâ€™s
over
the
threshold
itâ€™s
nine
points
of
the
law
but
i
donâ€™t
remember
saying
itâ€™
he
shamefacedly
and
naively
confessed
it
â€˜i
say
such
an
awful
lot
of
things
and
iâ€™m
always
changing
my
mind
itâ€™s
a
standing
joke
against
me
with
my
sister
she
says
the
recording
angel
will
have
two
sides
to
my
account
mondays
wednesdays
and
fridays
and
tuesdays
thursdays
and
saturdays--diametrically
opposite
convictions
and
both
kinds
wrong
on
sundays
i
am
all
things
to
all
men
as
for
sabathier
by
the
way
i
do
want
particularly
to
have
another
go
at
him
iâ€™ve
been
thinking
him
over
and
iâ€™m
afraid
in
some
ways
he
wonâ€™t
quite
wash
and
that
reminds
me
did
you
read
the
poor
chapâ€™
â€˜i
just
grubbed
through
a
page
or
two
but
most
of
my
french
was
left
at
school
what
i
did
do
though
was
to
show
the
book
to
an
old
friend
of
ours--my
wifeâ€™s
and
mine--just
to
skim--a
mr
bethany
heâ€™s
an
old
clergyman--our
vicar
in
factâ€™
herbert
had
sat
down
and
with
eyes
slightly
narrowed
was
listening
with
peculiar
attention
he
smiled
a
little
magnanimously
â€˜his
verdict
i
should
think
must
have
been
a
perfect
joyâ€™
â€˜he
saidâ€™
said
lawford
in
his
rather
low
monotonous
voice
â€˜he
said
it
was
precious
poor
stuff
that
it
reminded
him
of
patchouli
and
that
sabathier--the
print
i
mean--looked
like
a
foxy
old
roue
they
were
i
think
his
exact
words
we
were
alone
together
last
nightâ€™
â€˜you
donâ€™t
mean
that
he
simply
didnâ€™t
see
the
faintest
resemblanceâ€™
lawford
nodded
â€˜but
thenâ€™
he
added
simply
â€˜whenever
he
comes
to
see
me
now
he
leaves
his
spectacles
at
homeâ€™
and
at
that
as
if
at
some
preconcerted
signal
they
both
went
off
into
a
simple
shout
of
laughter
unanimous
and
sustained
but
this
first
wild
bout
of
laughter
over
the
first
real
bursting
of
the
dam
perhaps
for
years
lawford
found
himself
at
a
lower
ebb
than
ever
â€˜you
seeâ€™
he
said
presently
and
while
still
his
companionâ€™s
face
was
smiling
around
the
remembrance
of
his
laughter
like
ripples
after
the
splash
of
a
stone
â€˜bethany
has
been
absolutely
my
sheet-anchor
right
through
and
i
was--it
was--you
canâ€™t
possibly
realise
what
a
ghastly
change
it
really
was
i
donâ€™t
think
any
one
ever
willâ€™
herbert
opened
his
hand
and
looked
reflectively
into
its
palm
before
allowing
himself
to
reply
â€˜i
wonder
you
know
i
have
been
wondering
a
good
deal
simply
taking
the
other
point
of
view
for
a
moment
was
it
i
donâ€™t
mean
â€œghastlyâ€
exactly
like
say
smallpox
gpi
elephantiasis
but
was
it
quite
so
complete
so
radical
as
in
the
first
sheer
gust
of
astonishment
you
fanciedâ€™
lawford
thought
on
a
little
further
â€˜you
know
how
one
sees
oneself
in
a
passion--why
how
a
child
looks--the
whole
face
darkened
and
drawn
and
possessed
that
was
the
change
thatâ€™s
how
it
seems
to
come
back
to
me
and
something
somebody
dodging
behind
the
eyes
yes
more
that
than
even
any
excessive
change
of
feature
except
of
course
that
i
also
seemed--shall
i
ever
forget
that
first
cold
stifling
stare
into
the
looking-glass
i
certainly
was
much
darker
even
my
hair
but
iâ€™ve
told
you
all
this
beforeâ€™
he
added
wearily
â€˜and
the
scores
and
scores
of
times
iâ€™ve
thought
it
i
used
to
sit
up
there
in
the
big
spare
bedroom
my
wife
put
me
up
in
simply
gloating
my
flesh
seemed
nothing
more
than
an
hallucination
there
i
was
haunting
my
body
an
old
grinning
tenement
and
all
that
i
thought
i
wanted
and
couldnâ€™t
do
without
all
i
valued
and
prided
myself
on--stacked
up
in
the
drizzling
street
below
why
herbert
our
bodies
are
only
glass
or
cloud
they
melt
donâ€™t
they
like
wax
in
the
sun
once
weâ€™re
out
but
those
first
few
days
donâ€™t
make
very
pleasant
thinking
friday
night
was
the
first
when
i
sat
there
like
a
twitching
waxwork
soberly
debating
between
bedlam
here
and
bedlam
hereafter
i
even
sometimes
wonder
whether
its
very
repetition
has
not
dulled
the
memory
or
distorted
it
my
wifeâ€™
he
added
ingenuously
â€˜seems
to
think
there
are
signs
of
a
slight
improvement--a
going
back
i
mean
but
iâ€™m
not
sure
whether
she
meant
itâ€™
herbert
surveyed
his
visitor
critically
â€˜you
say
â€œdarkâ€
he
said
â€˜but
surely
lawford
your
hair
now
is
nearly
grey
well-flecked
at
leastâ€™
although
the
remark
carried
nothing
comparatively
of
a
shock
with
it
yet
it
seemed
to
lawford
as
if
an
electric
current
had
passed
over
his
scalp
coldly
stirring
every
hair
upon
his
head
but
somehow
or
other
it
was
easier
to
sit
quietly
on
to
express
no
surprise
to
let
them
do
or
say
what
they
liked
â€˜wellâ€™
he
retorted
with
an
odd
crooked
smile
â€˜you
must
remember
i
am
a
good
deal
older
than
i
was
last
saturday
i
grew
grey
in
the
grave
herbertâ€™
â€˜but
itâ€™s
like
this
you
knowâ€™
said
herbert
rising
excitedly
and
at
the
next
moment
on
reflection
composedly
reseating
himself
â€˜how
many
of
your
people
actually
saw
it
how
many
owned
to
its
being
as
bad
as
complete
as
you
made
out
i
donâ€™t
want
for
a
moment
to
cut
right
across
what
you
said
last
night--our
talk--but
there
are
two
million
sides
to
every
question
and
as
often
as
not
the
less
conspicuous
have
sounder--well--roots
thatâ€™s
allâ€™
â€˜i
think
really
do
you
know
i
would
rather
not
go
over
the
detestable
thing
again
not
many
my
wife
though
and
a
man
i
know
called
danton
who--whoâ€™s
prejudiced
after
all
i
have
myself
to
think
about
too
and
right
through
right
through--there
wasnâ€™t
the
least
doubt
of
that--they
all
in
their
hearts
knew
it
was
me
they
knew
i
was
behind
i
could
feel
that
absolutely
always
itâ€™s
not
just
eyes
and
ears
we
use
thereâ€™s
us
ourselves
to
consider
though
god
alone
knows
what
that
means
but
the
password
was
there
as
you
might
say
and
they
all
knew
i
knew
it
all--exceptâ€™--he
looked
up
as
if
in
bewilderment--â€˜except
just
one
a
poor
old
lady
a
very
old
friend
of
my
motherâ€™s
whom
i--i
sabathieredâ€™
â€˜whom--you--sabathieredâ€™
repeated
herbert
carefully
with
infinite
relish
looking
sidelong
at
his
visitor
â€˜and
it
is
just
precisely
thatâ€™
but
at
that
moment
his
sister
appeared
in
the
doorway
to
say
that
supper
was
ready
and
it
was
not
until
herbert
was
actually
engaged
in
carving
a
cold
chicken
that
he
followed
up
his
advantage
â€˜mr
lawford
griselâ€™
he
said
â€˜has
just
enriched
our
jaded
language
with
a
new
verb--to
sabathier
and
if
i
may
venture
to
define
it
in
the
presence
of
the
distinguished
neologist
himself
it
means
â€œto
deal
with
histrionicallyâ€
or
rather
thatâ€™s
what
it
will
mean
a
couple
of
hundred
years
hence
for
the
moment
it
means
â€œto
act
under
the
influence
of
subliminalization
to
perplex
or
bemuse
or
estrange
with
othernessâ€
do
tell
us
lawford
more
about
the
little
old
ladyâ€™
he
passed
with
her
plate
a
little
meaningful
glance
at
his
sister
and
repeated
â€˜doâ€™
â€˜but
iâ€™ve
been
plaguing
your
sister
enough
already
youâ€™ll
wishâ€™
lawford
began
and
turned
his
tired-out
eyes
towards
those
others
awaiting
them
so
frankly
they
seemed
in
their
perfect
friendliness
a
rest
from
all
his
troubles
â€˜you
seeâ€™
he
went
on
â€˜what
i
kept
on
thinking
and
thinking
of
was
to
get
a
quite
unbiased
and
unprejudiced
view
she
had
known
me
for
years
though
we
had
not
actually
met
more
than
once
or
twice
since
my
motherâ€™s
death
and
there
she
was
sitting
with
me
at
the
other
end
of
just
such
another
little
seat
asâ€™--he
turned--to
herbert
â€˜as
ours
at
widderstone
it
was
on
bewley
common
i
can
see
it
all
now
it
was
sunset
and
i
simply
turned
and
asked
her
in
a
kind
of
a
whining
affected
manner
if
she
remembered
me
and
when
after
a
long
time
she
came
round
to
owning
that
to
all
intents
and
purposes
she
did
not--i
professed
to
have
made
a
mistake
in
recognising
her
i
thinkâ€™
he
added
glancing
up
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
two
strange
friends
â€˜i
think
it
was
the
meanest
trick
i
can
rememberâ€™
â€˜hâ€™mâ€™
said
herbert
solemnly
â€˜i
wish
i
had
as
sensitive
a
conscience
but
as
your
old
friend
didnâ€™t
recognise
you
whoâ€™s
the
worse
as
for
her
not
doing
so
just
think
of
the
difference
a
few
years
makes
to
a
man
and
any
severe
shock
life
wears
so
infernally
badly
who
for
that
matter
does
not
change
even
in
character
and
yet
who
professes
to
see
it
mind
i
donâ€™t
say
in
essence
but
then
how
many
of
the
human
ghosts
one
meets
does
one
know
in
essence
one
doesnâ€™t
want
to
it
would
be
positively
cataclysmic
and
thatâ€™s
what
brings
me
around
to
feel
lawford
if
i
may
venture
to
say
so
that
you
may
have
brooded
a
little
too
keenly
on--on
your
own
case
tell
any
one
you
feel
ill
he
will
commiserate
with
you
to
positive
nausea
tell
any
priest
your
soul
is
in
danger
will
he
wait
for
proof
itâ€™s
misereres
and
penances
world
without
end
tell
any
woman
you
love
her
will
she
can
she
should
she
gainsay
you
there
you
are
the
catâ€™s
out
of
the
bag
you
see
my
sister
and
i
sat
up
half
the
night
talking
the
thing
over
i
said
iâ€™d
take
the
plunge
i
said
iâ€™d
risk
appearing
the
crassest
contradictoriest
wretch
that
ever
drew
breath
i
donâ€™t
deny
that
what
i
hinted
at
the
other
night
must
seem
in
part
directly
contrary
to
what
iâ€™m
going
to
say
nowâ€™
he
wheeled
his
black
eyes
as
if
for
inspiration
and
helped
himself
to
salad
â€˜itâ€™s
thisâ€™
he
said
â€˜isnâ€™t
it
possible
isnâ€™t
it
even
probable
that
being
ill
and
overstrung
moping
a
little
over
things
more
or
less
out
of
the
common
ruck
and
sitting
there
in
a
kind
of
trance--isnâ€™t
it
possible
that
you
may
have
very
largely
imagined
the
change
hypnotised
yourself
into
believing
it
much
worse--more
profound
radical
acute--and
simply
absolutely
hypnotizing
others
into
thinking
so
too
christendom
is
just
beginning
to
rediscover
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
faith
that
it
is
just
possible
that
say
megrims
or
melancholia
may
be
removed
at
least
as
easily
as
mountains
the
converse
of
course
is
obvious
on
the
face
of
it
a
man
fails
because
he
thinks
himself
a
failure
itâ€™s
the
men
that
run
away
that
lose
the
battle
suppose
then
lawfordâ€™--he
leaned
forward
keen
and
suave--â€˜suppose
you
have
been
and
â€œsabathieredâ€
yourselfâ€™
lawford
had
grown
accustomed
during
the
last
few
days
to
finding
himself
gazing
out
like
a
child
into
reality
as
if
from
the
windows
of
a
dream
he
had
in
a
sense
followed
this
long
loosely
stitched
preliminary
argument
he
had
at
least
in
part
realised
that
he
sat
there
between
two
clear
friendly
minds
acting
in
the
friendliest
and
most
obvious
collusion
but
he
was
incapable
of
fixing
his
attention
very
closely
on
any
single
fragment
of
herbertâ€™s
apology
or
of
rousing
himself
into
being
much
more
than
a
dispassionate
and
not
very
interested
spectator
of
the
little
melodrama
that
fate
it
appeared
had
at
the
last
moment
decided
rather
capriciously
to
twist
into
a
farce
he
turned
with
a
smile
to
the
face
so
keenly
fixed
and
enthusiastic
with
the
question
it
had
so
laboriously
led
up
to
â€˜but
surely
i
donâ€™t
quite
seeâ€™
herbert
lifted
his
glass
as
if
to
his
visitorâ€™s
acumen
and
set
it
down
again
without
tasting
it
â€˜why
my
dear
fellowâ€™
he
said
triumphantly
â€˜even
a
dream
must
have
a
peg
yours
was
this
unforgettable
old
suicide
candidly
now
how
much
of
sabathier
was
actually
yours
in
spite
of
all
that
that
fantastical
fellow
herbert
said
last
night
dead
men
donâ€™t
tell
tales
the
last
place
in
the
world
to
look
for
a
ghost
is
where
his
traitorous
bones
lie
crumbling
good
heavens

what
irrefutable
masses
of
evidence
there
would
be
at
our
finger-tips
if
every
tombstone
hid
its
ghost
no
the
fellow
just
arrested
you
with
his
creepy
epitaph
an
epitaph
mind
you
that
is
in
a
literary
sense
distinctly
fertilizing
it
catches
oneâ€™s
fancy
in
its
own
crude
way
as
pages
and
pages
of
infinitely
more
complicated
stuff
take
possession
of
germinate
and
sprout
in
oneâ€™s
imagination
in
another
way
we
are
all
psychical
parasites
why
given
his
epitaph
given
the
surroundings
i
wager
any
sensitive
consciousness
could
have
guessed
at
his
face
and
guessing
as
it
were
would
have
feigned

do
you

â€˜i

â€œthe

of
the
dogâ€
mr
lawfordâ€™
â€˜well
then
you
seeâ€™
said
herbert
over
a
hasty
mouthful
and
turning
again
to
his
victim--â€˜then
you
see
when
you
were
just
in
the
pink
of
condition
to
credit
any
idle
tale
you
heard
then
i
came
in
what
with
the
least
impetus
can
one
not
see
by
moonlight
the
howl
of
a
dog
turns
the
midnight
into
a
brocken
the
branch
of
a
tree
stoops
out
at
you
like
a
beelzebub
crusted
with
gadflies
iâ€™d
mind
you
sipped
of
the
deadly
old
huguenot
too
iâ€™d
listened
to
your
innocent
prattle
about
the
child
kicking
his
toes
out
on
deathâ€™s
cupboard
door
what
more
likely
thing
in
the
world
then
than
that
with
that
moon
in
that
packed
air
i
should
have
swallowed
the
bait
whole
and
seen
sabathier
in
every
crevice
of
your
skin
i
donâ€™t
say
there
wasnâ€™t
any
resemblance
it
was
for
the
moment
extraordinary
it
was
even
when
you
were
here
the
other
night
distinctly
arresting
but
now
poor
old
grisel
iâ€™m
nearly
done
all
i
want
to
say
is
this
that
if
we
had
the
â€œfoxy
old
roueâ€
here
now
and
grisel
played
paris
between
the
three
of
us
sheâ€™d
hand
over
the
apple
not
to
you
but
to
meâ€™
â€˜i
donâ€™t
quite
see
where
poor
paris
comes
inâ€™
suggested
grisel
meekly
â€˜no
nor
do
iâ€™
said
herbert
â€˜all
that
i
mean
sagacious
child
is
that
mr
lawford
no
more
resembles
the
poor
wretch
now
than
i
resemble
the
apollo
belvedere
if
you
had
only
heard
my
sister
scolding
me
railing
at
me
for
putting
such
ideas
into
your
jangled
head
they
donâ€™t
affect
me
one
iota
i
have
i
suppose
what
is
usually
called
imagination
which
merely
means
that
i
can
sup
with
the
devil
spoon
for
spoon
and
could
sleep
in
bluebeardâ€™s
linen-closet
without
turning
a
hair
you
if
i
am
not
very
much
mistaken
are
not
much
troubled
with
that
very
unprofitable
quality
and
so
i
suppose
when
a
crooked
and
bizarre
fancy
does
edge
into
your
mind
it
roots
thereâ€™
and
that
said
not
without
some
little
confusion
and
covert
glance
of
inquiry
at
his
sister
herbert
made
all
the
haste
he
could
to
catch
up
the
course
that
his
companions
had
already
finished
if
only
lawford
thought
this
insufferable
weariness
would
lift
awhile
he
could
enjoy
the
quiet
absurd
heedless
talk
and
this
very
friendly
topsy-turvy
effort
to
ease
his
mind
and
soothe
his
nerves
he
might
even
take
an
interest
again
in
his
â€˜caseâ€™
â€˜you
seeâ€™
he
said
turning
to
grisel
â€˜i
donâ€™t
think
it
really
very
much
matters
how
it
all
came
about
i
never
could
believe
it
would
last
it
may
perhaps--some
of
it
at
least
may
be
fancy
but
then
what
isnâ€™t
what
is
trustworthy
and
now
your
brother
tells
me
my
hairâ€™s
turning
grey
i
suppose
i
have
been
living
too
slowly
too
sluggishly
and
they
thought
it
was
high
time
to
stir
me
upâ€™
he
saw
with
extraordinary
vividness
the
low
panelled
room
the
still
listening
face
the
white
muslin
shoulders
and
dark
hair
and
the
eyes
that
seemed
to
recall
some
far-off
desolate
longing
for
home
and
childhood
it
was
all
a
dream
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter
even
now
perhaps
his
tired
old
stupid
body
was
lying
hunched
up
drenched
with
dew
upon
the
little
old
seat
under
the
mist-wreathed
branches
soon
it
would
bestir
itself
and
wake
up
and
go
off
home--home
to
sheila
to
the
old
deadly
round
that
once
had
seemed
so
natural
and
inevitable
to
the
old
dull
lawford--eyes
and
brain
and
heart
they
returned
up
the
dark
shallow
staircase
to
herbertâ€™s
book-room
and
he
talked
on
to
very
quiet
and
passive
listeners
in
his
own
fantastic
endless
fashion
and
ever
and
again
lawford
would
find
himself
intercepting
fleeting
and
anxious
glances
at
his
face
glances
almost
of
remorse
and
pity
and
thought
he
detected
beneath
this
irresponsible
contradictory
babble
an
unceasing
effort
to
clear
the
sky
to
lure
away
too
pressing
memories
to
put
his
doubts
and
fears
completely
to
rest
herbert
even
went
so
far
as
to
plead
guilty
when
grisel
gave
him
the
cue
of
having
a
little
heightened
and
overcoloured
his
story
of
the
restless
phantasmal
old
creature
that
haunted
their
queer
wooden
hauntable
old
house
and
when
they
rose
laughing
and
yawning
to
take
up
their
candles
it
was
after
all
after
a
rather
animated
discussion
with
many
a
hair-raising
ghost
story
brought
in
for
proof
between
brother
and
sister
as
to
exactly
how
many
times
that
snuff-coloured
spectre
had
made
his
appearance
and
with
less
unanimity
still
as
to
the
precise
manner
in
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
making
his
precipitant
exit
â€˜you
do
at
any
rate
acknowledge
grisel
that
the
old
creature
does
appear
and
that
you
saw
him
yourself
step
out
into
space
when
you
were
sitting
down
there
under
the
willow
shelling
peas
iâ€™ve
seen
him
twice
for
certain
once
rather
hazily
sallie
saw
him
so
plainly
she
asked
his
business
thatâ€™s
five
i
resignâ€™
â€˜acknowledgeâ€™
said
grisel
â€˜of
course
i
do
iâ€™d
acknowledge
anything
in
the
world
to
save
argument
why
i
donâ€™t
know
what
i
should
do
without
him
if
only
now
mr
lawford
would
give
him
a
fair
chance
to
show
himself
reading
quietly
here
about
ten
minutes
to
one
or
shelling
peas
even
if
he
prefers
it
if
only
heâ€™d
stay
long
enough
for
that
wouldnâ€™t
it
be
the
very
thing
for
them
bothâ€™
â€˜of
courseâ€™
said
herbert
cordially
â€˜the
very
thingâ€™
lawford
looked
up
at
neither
of
them
he
shook
his
head
but
he
needed
little
persuasion
to
stay
at
least
one
night
the
prospect
of
that
long
solitary
walk
of
that
tired
stupid
stooping
figure
dragging
itself
along
the
interminable
country
roads
seemed
a
sheer
impossibility
â€˜it
is
not--it
isnâ€™t
i
swear
it--the
other
that
beeps
me
backâ€™
he
had
solemnly
assured
the
friend
that
half
smiled
her
relief
at
his
acceptance
â€˜but--if
you
only
knew
how
empty
itâ€™s
all
got
now
all
reason
gone
even
to
go
on
at
allâ€™
â€˜but
doesnâ€™t
it
follow
of
course
itâ€™s
empty
and
now
life
is
going
to
begin
again
i
assure
you
it
is
i
do
indeed
only
only
have
courage--just
the
will
to
win
onâ€™
he
said
good-night
shut-to
the
latched
door
of
his
long
low
room
ceilinged
with
rafters
close
under
the
steep
roof
its
brown
walls
hung
with
quiet
dark
pondering
and
beautiful
faces
looking
gravely
across
at
him
and
with
his
candle
in
his
hand
he
sat
down
on
the
bedside
all
speculation
was
gone
the
noisy
clock
of
his
brain
had
run
down
again
he
turned
towards
the
old
oval
looking-glass
on
the
dressing-table
without
the
faintest
stirring
of
interest
suspense
or
anxiety
what
did
it
matter
what
a
man
looked
like--a
now
familiar
but
enfeebled
and
deprecating
voice
seemed
to
say
he
knew
that
a
change
had
come
even
sheila
had
noticed
it
and
since
then
what
had
he
not
gone
through
what
now
was
here
seemed
of
little
moment
so
far
at
least
as
this
world
was
concerned
at
last
with
an
effort
he
rose
crossed
the
uneven
floor
and
looked
in
unmovedly
on
what
was
his
own
poor
face
come
back
to
him
changed
indeed
almost
beyond
belief
from
the
sleek
self-satisfied
genial
yet
languid
arthur
lawford
of
the
past
years
and
still
haunted
with
some
faint
trace
of
the
set
and
icy
sharpness
and
challenge
and
affront
of
the
dark
adventurer
but
that--how
immeasurably
dimmed
and
blunted
and
faded
he
had
expected
to
find
it
so
would
it
the
thought
vanished
across
his
mind
would
it
have
been
as
unmistakably
there
had
he
come
hot-foot
fearing
expecting
to
find
the
other
but--was
he
disappointed
he
hardly
knew
how
long
he
stood
there
leaning
on
his
hands
surveying
almost
listlessly
in
the
candle-light
that
lined
bedraggled
grey
hopeless
countenance
those
dark-socketed
smouldering
eyes
whose
pupils
even
now
were
so
dilated
that
a
casual
glance
would
have
failed
to
detect
the
least
hint
of
any
iris
â€˜it
must
have
been
something
pretty
bad
you
were
you
know
or
something
pretty
bad
you
didâ€™
they
seemed
to
be
trying
to
say
to
him
â€˜to
drag
us
down
to
thisâ€™
he
knelt
down
by
force
of
habit
to
say
his
prayers
but
no
words
came
well
between
earthly
friends
a
betrayal
such
as
this
would
have
caused
a
livelong
estrangement
and
hostility
the
god
the
old
lawford
used
to
pray
to
would
forgive
him
he
thought
wearily
if
just
for
the
present
he
was
a
little
too
sore
at
heart
to
play
the
hypocrite
but
if
while
kneeling
he
said
nothing
he
saw
a
good
many
things
in
such
tranquillity
and
clearness
as
the
mere
eyes
of
the
body
can
share
but
rarely
with
their
sisters
of
the
imagination
and
now
it
was
alice
who
looked
mournfully
out
of
the
dark
at
him
and
now
the
little
old
charwoman
mrs
gull
with
her
bag
hooked
over
her
arm
climbed
painfully
up
the
area
steps
and
now
it
was
the
lean
vexed
face
of
a
friend
nursing
some
restless
and
anxious
grievance
against
him--mr
bethany
and
then
and
ever
again
it
was
the
face
of
one
who
seemed
pure
dream
and
fantasy
and
yet
he
listened
intently
and
fancied
even
now
he
could
hear
the
voices
of
brother
and
sister
talking
quietly
and
circumspectly
together
in
the
room
beneath
a
quiet
knocking
aroused
him
in
the
long
tranquil
bedroom
and
herbertâ€™s
head
was
poked
into
the
room
â€˜thereâ€™s
a
bath
behind
that
door
over
thereâ€™
he
whispered
or
if
you
like
iâ€™m
off
for
a
bathe
in
the
widder
itâ€™s
a
luscious
day
shall
i
wait
all
rightâ€™
and
the
head
was
withdrawn
â€˜donâ€™t
put
much
onâ€™
came
the
voice
at
the
panel
â€˜weâ€™ll
be
home
again
in
twenty
minutesâ€™
the
green
and
brightness
of
the
morning
must
have
been
prepared
for
overnight
by
spiders
and
the
dew
everywhere
the
gleaming
nets
were
hung
and
everywhere
there
rose
a
tiny
splendour
from
the
waterdrops
so
clear
and
pure
and
changeable
it
seemed
with
their
fire
and
colour
they
shook
a
tiny
crystal
music
in
the
air
herbert
led
the
way
along
a
clayey
downward
path
beneath
hazels
tossing
softly
together
their
twigs
of
nuts
until
they
came
out
into
a
rounded
hollow
that
mounded
with
thyme
sloped
gently
down
to
the
green
banks
of
the
widder
the
water
poured
like
clearest
glass
beneath
a
rain
of
misty
sunbeams
â€˜my
sister
always
says
that
this
is
the
very
dell
boccaccio
had
in
his
mindâ€™s
eye
when
he
wrote
the
â€œdecameronâ€
there
really
is
something
almost
classic
in
those
pines
and
iâ€™d
sometimes
swear
with
my
eyes
just
out
of
the
water
iâ€™ve
seen
dryads
half
in
hiding
peeping
between
those
beeches
good
lord
lawford
what
a
world
we
wretched
moderns
have
made
and
missedâ€™
the
water
was
violently
cold
it
seemed
to
lawford
as
it
swept
up
over
his
body
and
as
he
plunged
his
night-distorted
eyes
beneath
its
blazing
surface
that
it
was
charged
with
some
strange
powerful
enchantment
to
wash
away
in
its
icy
clearness
even
the
memory
of
the
dull
and
tarnished
days
behind
him
if
one
could
but
tie
up
anyhow
that
stained
bundle
of
inconsequent
memories
called
life
and
fling
it
into
a
cupboard
remoter
even
than
bluebeardâ€™s
and
lock
the
door
and
drop
the
quickly-rusting
key
into
these
living
waters
he
dressed
himself
with
window
thrown
open
to
the
blackbirds
and
thrushes
and
the
occasional
shrill
solitary
whistling
of
a
robin
but
like
the
sour-sweet
fragrance
of
the
brier
its
wandering
desolate
burst
of
music
had
power
to
wake
memory
and
carried
him
instantly
back
to
that
first
aimless
descent
into
the
evening
gloom
of
widderstone
from
which
it
was
in
vain
to
hope
ever
to
climb
again
surely
never
a
more
ghoulish
face
looked
out
on
its
man
before
than
that
which
confronted
him
as
with
borrowed
razor
he
stood
shaving
those
sunken
chaps
that
angular
chin
and
even
now
beneath
the
lantern
of
broad
daylight
just
as
within
that
other
face
had
lurked
the
undeniable
ghost
and
presence
of
himself
so
beneath
the
sunken
features
seemed
to
float
tenuous
as
smoke
scarcely
less
elusive
than
a
dream
between
eye
and
object
the
sinister
darkness
of
the
face
that
in
those
two
bouts
with
fear
he
had
by
some
strange
miracle
managed
to
repel
â€˜work
inâ€™
the
chance
phrase
came
back
it
had
worked
in
in
sober
earnest
and
so
far
as
the
living
of
the
next
few
weeks
went
surely
it
might
prove
an
ally
without
which
he
simply
could
not
conceive
himself
as
struggling
on
at
all
but
as
dexterous
minds
as
even
restless
sabathierâ€™s
had
him
just
now
in
safe
and
kindly
keeping
all
the
quiet
october
morning
herbert
kept
him
talking
and
stooping
over
his
extraordinary
collection
of
books
â€˜the
point
isâ€™
he
explained
to
lawford
standing
amid
a
positive
archipelago
of
precious
â€˜findsâ€™
with
his
foot
hoisted
onto
a
chair
and
a
patched-up
sea-stained
folio
on
his
knee
â€˜i
honestly
detest
the
mere
give
and
take
of
what
we
are
fools
enough
to
call
life
i
donâ€™t
deny
lifeâ€™s
thereâ€™
he
swept
his
hand
towards
the
open
window--â€˜in
that
frantic
tophet
we
call
london
but
thereâ€™s
no
focus
no
point
of
vantage
even
a
scribbler
only
gets
it
piecemeal
and
through
a
dulled
medium
we
learn
to
read
before
we
know
how
to
see
we
swallow
our
tastes
convictions
and
emotions
whole
so
that
nine-tenths
of
the
worldâ€™s
nectar
is
merely
honeydewâ€™
he
smiled
pleasantly
into
the
fixed
vacancy
of
his
visitorâ€™s
face
â€˜thatâ€™s
why
iâ€™ve
just
gone
onâ€™
he
continued
amiably
â€˜collecting
this
particular
kind
of
stuff--what
you
might
call
riff-raff
thereâ€™s
not
a
book
here
lawford
that
hasnâ€™t
at
least
a
glimmer
of
the
real
thing
in
it--just
life
seen
through
a
living
eye
and
felt
as
for
literature
and
style
and
all
that
gallimaufry
donâ€™t
fear
for
them
if
your
author
has
the
ghost
of
a
hint
of
genius
in
his
makingâ€™
â€˜but
surelyâ€™
said
lawford
trying
for
the
twentieth
time
to
pretend
to
himself
that
these
endless
books
carried
the
faintest
savour
of
the
delight
to
him
which
they
must
he
rather
forlornly
supposed
shower
upon
herbert
â€˜surely
genius
is
a
very
rare
thingâ€™
â€˜rare
the
world
simply
swarms
with
it
but
before
you
can
bottle
it
up
in
a
book
itâ€™s
got
to
be
articulate
just
for
a
single
instant
imagine
yourself
falstaff
and
if
there
werenâ€™t
hundreds
of
falstaffs
in
every
generation
to
be
examples
of
his
ungodly
life
heâ€™d
be
as
dead
as
a
doornail
to-morrow--imagine
yourself
falstaff
and
being
so
sitting
down
to
write
â€œhenry
ivâ€
or
â€œthe
merry
wivesâ€
itâ€™s
simply
preposterous
you
wouldnâ€™t
be
such
a
fool
as
to
waste
the
time
a
mere
elizabethan
scribbler
comes
along
with
a
gift
of
expression
and
an
observant
eye
lifts
the
bloated
old
tippler
clean
out
of
life
and
swims
down
the
ages
as
the
greatest
genius
the
world
has
ever
seen
whereas
surely
though
you
mustnâ€™t
let
me
bore
you
with
all
this
piffle

the
genius

pretty
rare
in

can
tell
you
weâ€™re
all

sodden
with

drugged
with
the
second-hand

barnacled
with
respectability
until--until

comes
goodness
knows
where

but
thereâ€™s
no
mistaking

noâ€™
â€˜but

said
lawford
uneasily
â€˜what

â€˜i

cease
to
be

up
in

squeeze
through

the
other
side
when
you
suffer
a
kind
of
conversion
of
the
mind

aware
of
your
senses
when
you
get
a
living
inkling
when
you
become
articulate
to
yourself
when
you
seeâ€™
â€˜i
am
awfully
stupidâ€™
lawford
murmured
â€˜but
even
now
i
donâ€™t
really
follow
you
a
bit
but
when
as
you
say
you
do
become
articulate
to
yourself
what
happens
thenâ€™
â€˜why
thenâ€™
said
herbert
with
a
shrug
almost
of
despair
â€˜then
begins
the
weary
tramp
back
one
by
one

off
the
truisms
and
the
grundyisms
and
the
pedantries

all
the
stillborn
claptrap
of
the

off
then
one
can
seriously
begin
to
think
about
saving
oneâ€™s
soulâ€™
â€˜saving

groaned
lawford
â€˜why
i
am
not
even
sure
of
my
own
body
yetâ€™
he
walked
slowly
over
to
the
window
and
with
every
thought
in
his
head
as
quiet
as
doves
on
a
sunny
wall
stared
out
into
the
garden
of
green
things
growing
leaves
fading
and
falling
water
â€˜i
tell
you
whatâ€™
he
said
turning
irresolutely
â€˜i
wonder
if
you
could
possibly
find
time
to
write
me
out

translation
of
sabathier
my
french
is
much
too
hazy
to
let
me
really
get
at
the
chap
heâ€™s
gone
now
but
i
really
should
like
to
know
what
kind
of
stuff
exactly
he
has
left
behindâ€™
â€˜oh
sabathierâ€™
said
herbert
laughing
â€˜what
do
you
think
of
that
griselâ€™
he
asked
turning
to
his
sister
who
at
that
moment
had
looked
in
at
the
door
â€˜hereâ€™s
mr
lawford
asking
me
to
make
a
translation
of
sabathier
lunch
lawfordâ€™
lawford
sighed
and
not
until
he
had
slowly
descended
half
the
narrow
uneven
stairs
that
led
down
to
the
dining-room
did
he
fully
realise
the
guile
of
a
sister
that
could
induce
a
hopeless
bookworm
to
waste
a
whole
morning
over
the
stupidest
of
companions
simply
to
keep
his
tired-out
mind
from
rankling
and
give
his
sabathier
a
chance
to
go
to
roost
â€˜i
think
do
you
knowâ€™
he
managed
to
blurt
out
at
last
â€˜i
think
i
ought
to
be
getting
home
again
the
house
is
empty--and--â€™
â€˜you
shall
go
this
eveningâ€™
said
herbert
â€˜if
you
really
must
insist
on
it
but
honestly
lawford
we
both
think
that
after
what
the
last
few
days
must
have
been
it
is
merely
common
sense
to
take
a
rest
how
can
you
possibly
rest
with
a
dozen
empty
rooms
echoing
every
thought
you
think
thereâ€™s
nothing
more
to
worry
about
you
agree
to
that
send
your
people
a
note
saying
that
you
are
here
safe
and
sound

them
a
chance
of
lighting
a
fire
and
driving
in
the
fatted
calf

on
with
us
just
the
week
outâ€™
lawford
turned
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
two
friendly
faces
but
what
was
dimly
in
his
mind
refused
to
express
itself
â€˜i
think
you
know
i--â€™
he
began
falteringly
â€˜but
itâ€™s
just
this
thinking
thatâ€™s
the
deuce--this
preposterous
habit
of
having
continually
to
make
up
oneâ€™s
mind
off
with
his
head
grisel
my
sisterâ€™s
going
to
take
you
for
a
picnic
we
go
every
other
fine
afternoon
and
you
can
argue
it
out
with
herâ€™
once
alone
again
with
grisel
however
lawford
found
talking
unnecessary
silences
seemed
to
fall
between
them
as
quietly
and
restfully
as
evening
flows
into
night
they
walked
on
slowly
through
the
fading
woods
and
when
they
had
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
that
sloped
down
to
the
dark
and
foamless
widder
they
sat
down
in
the
honey-scented
sunshine
on
a
knoll
of
heather
and
bracken
and
grisel
lighted
the
little
spirit-kettle
she
had
brought
with
her
and
busied
herself
very
methodically
over
making
tea
that
done
she
clasped
her
hands
round
her
knees
and
sat
now
gossiping
now
silent
in
the
pale
autumnal
beauty
there
was
a
bird
wistfully
twittering
in
the
branches
overhead
and
ever
and
again
a
withered
leaf
would
slip
circling
down
from
the
motionless
beech
boughs
arched
in
their
stillness
above
their
heads
beneath
the
thin
blue
sky
â€˜men
you
knowâ€™
she
began
again
suddenly
starting
out
of
reverie
â€˜really
are
absurdly
blind
and
just
a
little
bit
absurdly
kindly
stupid
how
many
times
have
i
been
at
the
point
of
laughing
out
at
my
brotherâ€™s
delicious
naive
subtleties
but
you
do
you
will
understand
mr
lawford
that
he
was
that
we
are
both
â€œdoing
our
bestâ€--to
make
amendsâ€™
â€˜i
understand--i
do
indeed--a
tenth
part
of
all
your
kindnessâ€™
â€˜yes
but
thatâ€™s
just
it--that
horrible
word
â€œkindnessâ€
if
ever
there
were
two
utterly
self-absorbed
people
without
a
trace
with
an
absolute
horror
of
kindness
it
is
just
my
brother
and
i
itâ€™s
most
of
it
false
and
most
of
it
useless
we
all
surely
must
take
what
comes
in
this
topsy-turvy
world
i
believe
in
saying
out--that
the
more
one
thinks
about
life
the
worse
it
becomes
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
happiness
in
this
world--a
wooden
postâ€™s
and
prometheusâ€™s
and
who
ever
heard
of
any
one
having
the
impudence
to
be
kind
to
prometheus
as
for
a
miserable
â€œmediumâ€
like
me
not
quite
a
post
and
leagues
and
leagues
from
even
envying
a
prometheus
sheâ€™s
better
for
the
powder
without
the
jam
but
thatâ€™s
all
nothing
what
i
canâ€™t
help
thinking--and
itâ€™s
not
a
bit
giving
my
brother
away
because
we
both
think
it--that
it
was
partly
our
thoughtlessness
that
added
at
least
something
to--to
the
rest
it
was
perfectly
absurd
he
saw
you
were
ill
he
saw--he
must
have
seen
even
in
that
first
sunday
talk--that
your
nerves
were
all
askew
and
who
doesnâ€™t
know
what
â€œnervesâ€
means
nowadays
and
yet
he
deliberately
chattered
he
loves
it--just
at
large
you
know
like
me
i
told
him
before
i
came
out
that
i
intended
if
i
could
to
say
all
this
and
now
itâ€™s
said
youâ€™ll
please
forgive
me
for
going
back
to
itâ€™
â€˜please
donâ€™t
talk
about
forgiveness
but
when
you
say
he
chattered
you
mean
about
sabathier
of
course
and
that
you
know
i
donâ€™t
care
a
fig
for
now
we
can
settle
all
that
between
ourselves--him
and
me
i
mean
and
now
tell
me
candidly
again--is
there
any
â€œpreyâ€
in
my
face
nowâ€™
she
looked
up
fleetingly
into
his
eyes
leant
back
her
head
and
laughed
â€˜â€œpreyâ€
there
never
was
a
glimpseâ€™
â€˜and
â€œchangeâ€â€™
their
eyes
met
again
in
an
infinitely
brief
infinitely
bewildering
argument
â€˜really
really
scarcely
perceptibleâ€™
she
assured
him
â€˜except
of
course
how
horribly
horribly
ill
you
look
and
that
only
seems
to
prove
to
me
you
must
be
hiding
something
else
no
illusion
on
earth
could--could
have
done
that
to
your
faceâ€™
â€˜you
think
i
knowâ€™
he
persisted
â€˜that
i
must
be
persuaded
and
cosseted
and
humoured
yes
you
do
itâ€™s
my
poor
old
sanity
thatâ€™s
really
in
both
your
minds
perhaps
i
am--not
absolutely
sound
anyhow
iâ€™ve
been
watching
it
in
your
looks
at
each
other
all
the
time
and
i
can
never
never
say
never
tell
you
what
you
have
done
for
me
but
you
see
after
all
we
did
win
through
i
keep
on
telling
myself
that
so
that
now
itâ€™s
purely
from
the
most
selfish
and
practical
motives
that
i
want
you
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
me
i
have
to
go
back
you
know
and
some
of
them
one
or
two
of
my
friends
i
mean
are
not
all
on
my
side
think
of
me
as
i
was
when
you
came
into
the
room
three
centuries
ago
and
you
turned
and
looked
frowning
at
me
in
the
candle-light
remember
that
and
look
at
me
now
what
is
the
difference
does
it
shock
you
does
it
make
the
whole
world
seem
a
trick
a
sham
does
it
simply
sour
your
life
to
think
such
a
thing
possible
oh
the
hours
iâ€™ve
spent
gloating
on
widderstoneâ€™s
miserable
mask
of
skin
and
bone
as
i
was
saying
to
your
brother
only
last
night
and
never
knew
until
they
shuffled
me
that
the
old
self
too
was
nothing
better
than
a
stifling
suffocating
maskâ€™
â€˜but
donâ€™t
you
seeâ€™
she
argued
softly
turning
her
face
away
a
little
â€˜you
were
a
stranger
then
though
i
certainly
didnâ€™t
mean
to
frown
and
then
a
little
while
after
we
were
well
just
human
beings
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
if
friendship
does
not
mean
that
i
donâ€™t
know
what
it
does
mean
and
now
you
are--well
just
you
the
you
you
know
of
three
centuries
ago
and
if
you
mean
to
ask
me
whether
at
any
precise
moment
i
have
been
conscious
that
this
you
i
am
now
speaking
to
was
not
the
you
of
last
night
or
of
that
dark
climb
up
the
hill
why
it
is
simply
frantic
to
think
it
could
ever
be
necessary
to
say
over
and
over
again
no
but
if
you
mean
have
you
changed
else
all
i
could
answer
is
donâ€™t
we
all
change
as
we
grow
to
know
one
another
what
were
just
features
what
just
dingily
represented
one
as
it
were
is
forgotten
or
rather
gets
remembered
of
course
the
first
glimpse
is
the
landscape
under
lightning
as
it
were
but
afterwards
isnâ€™t
it
surely
like
the
alphabet
to
a
child
what
was
first
a
queer
angular
scrawl
becomes
a
and
is
always
ever
after
a
undistinguished
half-forgotten
yet
standing
at
last
for
goodness
knows
what
real
wonderful
things--or
for
just
the
dry
bones
of
soulless
words
is
that
itâ€™
she
stole
a
sidelong
glance
into
his
brooding
face
leaning
her
head
on
her
hand
â€˜yes
yesâ€™
came
the
rather
dissatisfied
reply
â€˜i
do
agree
perfectly
but
then
you
see--i
told
you
i
was
going
to
talk
of
nothing
but
myself--what
did
at
first
happen
to
me
was
something
much
worse
and
i
suppose
something
quite
different
from
thatâ€™
â€˜and
yet
didnâ€™t
you
tell
us
that
of
all
your
friends
not
one
really
denied
in
their
hearts
your--what
they
would
call
i
suppose--your
identity
except
that
poor
little
offended
old
lady
and
even
she
if
my
intuition
is
worth
a
penny
piece
even
she
when
you
go
soon
and
talk
to
her
will
own
that
she
did
know
you
and
that
it
was
not
because
you
were
a
stranger
that
she
was
offended
but
because
you
so
ungenerously
pretended
to
be
one
that
was
a
little
mad
now
if
you
likeâ€™
â€˜oh
yesâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜i
am
going
to
ask
her
forgiveness
i
donâ€™t
know
what
i
didnâ€™t
vow
to
take
her
for
a
peace-offering
if
the
chance
should
ever
come--and
the
courage--to
make
my
peace
with
her
but
now
that
the
chance
has
come
and
i
think
the
courage
it
is
the
desire
thatâ€™s
gone
i
donâ€™t
seem
to
care
either
way
i
feel
as
if
i
had
got
past
making
my
peace
with
any
oneâ€™
but
this
time
no
answer
helped
him
out
â€˜after
allâ€™
he
went
plodding
on
â€˜there
is
more
than
just
the
mere
day
to
day
to
consider
and
one
doesnâ€™t
realise
that
oneâ€™s
face
actually
is
oneâ€™s
fortune
without
a
shock
and
that
that
gone
one
is
as
your
brother
said
just
like
a
bee
come
back
to
the
wrong
hive
it
underminesâ€™
he
smiled
rather
bitterly
â€˜oneâ€™s
views
rather
and
it
certainly
shifts
oneâ€™s
friends
if
it
hadnâ€™t
been
just
for
my
oldâ€™--he
stopped
dead
and
again
pushed
slowly
on--â€˜if
it
hadnâ€™t
been
for
our
old
friend
mr
bethany
i
doubt
if
we
should
now
have
had
a
soul
on
our
side
i
once
read
somewhere
that
wolves
always
chase
the
old
and
weak
and
maimed
out
of
the
pack
and
after
all
what
do
we
do
where
do
we
keep
the
homeless
and
the
insane
and
yet
you
knowâ€™
he
added
ruminatingly
â€˜it
is
not
as
if
mine
was
ever
a
particularly
lovely
or
lovable
face
while
as
for
the
poor
wretch
behind
it
well
i
really
cannot
see
what
meaning
or
life
even
he
had
before--â€™
â€˜beforeâ€™
lawford
met
bravely
the
clear
whimsical
eyes
â€˜before
i
was
sabathieredâ€™
grisel
laughed
outright
â€˜you
thinkâ€™
he
retorted
almost
bitterly
â€˜you
think
i
am
talking
like
a
childâ€™
â€˜yesâ€™
she
sighed
cheerfully
â€˜i
was
quite
envying
youâ€™
â€˜well
there
i
amâ€™
said
lawford
inconsequently
â€˜and
now
well
now
i
suppose
the
whole
thingâ€™s
to
begin
again
i
canâ€™t
help
beginning
to
wonder
what
the
meaning
of
it
all
is
why
oneâ€™s
duty
should
always
seem
so
very
stupid
a
thing
and
then
too
what
can
there
be
on
earth
that
even
a
buried
sabathier
could
desireâ€™
he
glanced
up
in
a
really
animated
perplexity
at
the
still
dark
face
turned
in
the
evening
light
towards
the
darkening
valley
and
perplexity
deepened
into
a
disquieted
frown--like
that
of
a
child
who
is
roused
suddenly
from
a
daydream
by
the
half-forgotten
question
of
a
stranger
he
turned
his
eyes
almost
furtively
away
as
if
afraid
of
disturbing
her
and
for
awhile
they
sat
in
silence
at
last
he
turned
again
almost
shyly
â€˜i
hope
some
day
you
will
let
me
bring
my
daughter
to
see
youâ€™
â€˜yes
yesâ€™
said
grisel
eagerly
â€˜we
should
both
love
it
of
course
isnâ€™t
it
curious--i
simply
knew
you
had
a
daughter
sheer
intuitionâ€™
â€˜i
say
â€œsome
dayâ€â€™
said
lawford
â€˜i
know
though
that
that
some
day
will
never
comeâ€™
â€˜wait
just
waitâ€™
replied
the
quiet
confident
voice
â€˜that
will
come
too
one
thing
at
a
time
mr
lawford
youâ€™ve
won
your
old
self
back
again
youâ€™ll
win
your
old
love
of
life
back
again
in
a
little
while
never
fear
oh
donâ€™t
i
know
that
awful
landâ€™s
end
after
illness
and
that
longing
too
that
gnawing
longing
too
for
ultima
thule
so
itâ€™s
a
bargain
between
us
that
you
bring
your
daughter
soonâ€™
she
busied
herself
over
the
tea
things
â€˜and
of
courseâ€™
she
added
as
if
it
were
an
afterthought
looking
across
at
him
in
the
pale
green
sunlight
as
she
knelt
â€˜you
simply
wonâ€™t
think
of
going
back
to-night
solitude
i
really
do
think
solitude
just
now
would
be
absolute
madness
youâ€™ll
write
to-day
and
go
perhaps
to-morrowâ€™
lawford
looked
across
in
his
mind
at
his
square
ungainly
house
full-fronting
the
afternoon
sun
he
tried
to
repress
a
shudder
â€˜i
think
do
you
know
i
ought
to
go
to-dayâ€™
â€˜well
why
not
why
not
just
to
reassure
yourself
that
allâ€™s
well
and
come
back
here
to
sleep
if
youâ€™d
really
promise
that
iâ€™d
drive
you
in
iâ€™d
love
it
thereâ€™s
the
jolliest
little
governess-cart
we
sometimes
hire
for
our
picnics
way
i
youâ€™ve
no
idea
how
much
easier
in
our
minds
my
brother
and
i
would
be
if
you
would
and
then
to-morrow
or
at
any
rate
the
next
day
you
shall
be
surrendered
whole
and
in
your
right
mind
there
thatâ€™s
a
bargain
too
now
we
must
hurryâ€™
herbert
himself
went
down
to
order
the
governess
cart
and
packed
them
in
with
a
rug
and
in
the
dusk
grisel
set
lawford
down
at
the
corner
of
his
road
and
drove
on
to
an
old
booksellerâ€™s
with
a
commission
from
her
brother
promising
to
return
for
him
in
an
hour
dust
and
a
few
straws
lay
at
rest
as
if
in
some
abstruse
arrangement
on
the
stones
of
the
porch
just
as
the
last
faint
whirling
gust
of
sunset
had
left
them
shut
lids
of
sightless
indifference
seemed
to
greet
the
wanderer
from
the
curtained
windows
he
opened
the
door
and
went
in
for
a
moment
he
stood
in
the
vacant
hall
then
he
peeped
first
into
the
blind-drawn
dining-room
faintly
dingily
sweet
like
an
empty
wine-bottle
he
went
softly
on
a
few
paces
and
just
opening
the
door
looked
in
on
the
faintly
glittering
twilight
of
the
drawing-room
but
the
congealed
stump
of
candle
that
he
had
set
in
the
corner
as
a
final
rancorous
challenge
to
the
beaten
shade
was
gone
he
slowly
and
deliberately
ascended
the
stairs
conscious
of
a
peculiar
sense
of
ownership
of
what
in
even
so
brief
an
absence
had
taken
on
so
queer
a
look
of
strangeness
it
was
almost
as
if
he
might
be
some
lone
heir
come
in
the
rather
mournful
dusk
to
view
what
melancholy
fate
had
unexpectedly
bestowed
on
him
â€˜work
inâ€™--what
on
earth
else
could
this
chill
sense
of
strangeness
mean
would
he
ever
free
his
memory
from
that
one
haphazard
haunting
hint
and
as
he
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
big
calm
room
which
seemed
even
now
to
be
stirring
with
the
restless
shadow
of
these
last
few
far-away
days
now
pacing
sullenly
to
and
fro
now
sitting
hunched-up
to
think
and
now
lying
impotent
in
a
vain
hopeless
endeavour
only
for
the
breath
of
a
moment
to
forget--he
awoke
out
of
reverie
to
find
himself
smiling
at
the
thought
that
a
changed
face
was
practically
at
the
mercy
of
an
incredulous
world
whereas
a
changed
heart
was
no
oneâ€™s
deadly
dull
affair
but
its
ownerâ€™s
the
merest
breath
of
pity
even
stole
over
him
for
the
sabathier
who
after
all
had
dared
and
had
needed
perhaps
nothing
like
so
arrogant
and
merciless
a
coup
de
grace
to
realise
that
he
had
so
ignominiously
failed
â€˜but
there
thatâ€™s
doneâ€™
he
exclaimed
out
loud
not
without
a
tinge
of
regret
that
theories
however
brilliant
and
bizarre
could
never
now
be
anything
else--that
now
indeed
that
the
symptoms
had
gone
the
â€˜maladyâ€™
for
all
who
had
not
been
actually
admitted
into
the
shocked
circle
was
become
nothing
more
than
an
inanely
â€˜tallâ€™
story
stuffing
not
even
savoury
enough
for
a
goose
how
wide
exactly
he
wondered
would
sheilaâ€™s
discreet
shocked
circle
prove
he
stood
once
more
before
the
looking-glass
hearing
again
griselâ€™s
words
in
the
still
green
shadow
of
the
beech-tree
â€˜except
of
course
horribly
horribly
illâ€™
â€˜what
a
fool
what
a
coward
she
thinks
i
amâ€™
there
was
still
nearly
an
hour
to
be
spent
in
this
great
barn
of
faded
interests
he
lit
a
candle
and
descended
into
the
kitchen
a
mouse
went
scampering
to
its
hole
as
he
pushed
open
the
door
the
memory
of
that
ravenous
morning
meal
nauseated
him
it
was
sour
and
very
still
here
he
stood
erect
the
air
smelt
faint
of
earth
in
the
breakfast-room
the
bookcase
still
swung
open
late
evening
mantled
the
garden
and
in
sheer
ennui
again
he
sat
down
to
the
table
and
turned
for
a
last
not
unfriendly
hob-a-nob
with
his
poor
old
friend
sabathier
he
would
take
the
thing
back
herbert
of
course
was
going
to
translate
it
for
him
now
if
the
patient
old
frenchman
had
stormed
herbert
instead--that
surely
would
have
been
something
like
a
coup
those
frenzied
books
the
absurd
talk
of
the
man
herbert
was
perfectly
right--he
could
have
entertained
fifty
old
huguenots
without
turning
a
hair
â€˜iâ€™m
such
an
awful
stodgeâ€™
he
turned
the
woolly
leaves
over
very
slowly
he
frowned
impatiently
and
from
the
end
backwards
turned
them
over
again
then
he
laid
the
book
softly
down
on
the
table
and
sat
back
he
stared
with
narrowed
lids
into
the
flame
of
his
quiet
friendly
candle
every
trace
every
shred
of
portrait
and
memoir
were
gone
once
more
deliberately
punctiliously
he
examined
page
by
page
the
blurred
and
unfamiliar
french--the
sooty
heads
the
long
lean
noses
the
baggy
eyes
passing
like
figures
in
a
peepshow
one
by
one
under
his
hand--to
the
last
fragmentary
and
dexterously
mended
leaf
yes
sabathier
was
gone
quite
the
old
slow
lawford
smile
crept
over
his
face
at
the
discovery
it
was
a
smile
a
little
sheepish
too
as
he
thought
of
sheilaâ€™s
quiet
vigilance
and
the
next
instant
he
had
looked
up
sharply
with
a
sudden
peculiar
shrug
and
a
kind
of
cry
like
the
first
thin
cry
of
an
awakened
child
in
his
mind
without
a
momentâ€™s
hesitation
he
climbed
swiftly
upstairs
again
to
the
big
sepulchral
bedroom
he
pressed
with
his
fingernail
the
tiny
spring
in
the
looking-glass
the
empty
drawer
flew
open
there
were
finger-marks
still
in
the
dust
yet
strangely
enough
beneath
all
the
clashing
thoughts
that
came
flocking
into
his
mind
as
he
stood
with
the
empty
drawer
in
his
hand
was
a
wounding
yet
still
a
little
amused
pity
for
his
old
friend
mr
bethany
so
far
as
he
himself
was
concerned
the
discovery--well
he
would
have
plenty
of
time
to
consider
everything
that
could
possibly
now
concern
himself
anyhow
it
could
only
simplify
matters
he
remembered
waking
to
that
old
wave
of
sickening
horror
on
the
first
unhappy
morning
he
remembered
the
keen
yet
owlish
old
face
blinking
its
deathless
friendliness
at
him
and
the
steady
pressure
of
the
cold
skinny
hand
as
for
sheila
she
had
never
done
anything
by
halves
certainly
not
when
it
came
to
throwing
over
a
friend
no
longer
necessary
to
oneâ€™s
social
satisfaction
but
she
would
edge
out
cleverly
magnanimously
triumphantly
enough
no
doubt
when
the
day
of
reckoning
should
come
the
day
when
her
nets
wide
spread
her
bait
prepared
he
must
stand
up
before
her
outraged
circle
and
positively
prove
himself
her
lawful
husband
perhaps
even
to
the
very
imprint
of
his
thumb
â€˜poor
old
thingâ€™
he
said
again
and
this
time
his
pity
was
shared
almost
equally
between
both
witnesses
to
mr
bethanyâ€™s
ingenuous
little
document
the
loss
of
which
had
fallen
so
softly
and
pathetically
that
he
felt
only
ashamed
of
having
discovered
it
so
soon
he
shut
back
the
tell-tale
drawer
and
after
trying
to
collect
his
thoughts
in
case
anything
should
have
been
forgotten
he
turned
with
a
deep
trembling
sigh
to
descend
the
stairs
but
on
the
landing
he
drew
back
at
the
sound
of
voices
and
then
a
footstep
soon
came
the
sound
of
a
key
in
the
lock
he
blew
out
his
candle
and
leant
listening
over
the
balusters
â€˜whoâ€™s
thereâ€™
he
called
quietly
â€˜me
sirâ€™
came
the
feeble
reply
out
of
the
darkness
â€˜what
is
it
ada
what
have
you
come
forâ€™
â€˜only
sir
to
see
that
all
was
safe
and
you
were
in
sirâ€™
â€˜yesâ€™
he
said
â€˜allâ€™s
safe
and
i
am
in
what
if
i
had
been
outâ€™
it
was
like
dropping
tiny
pebbles
into
a
deep
well--so
long
after
came
the
answering
feeble
splash
â€˜then
i
was
to
go
back
sirâ€™
and
a
moment
after
the
discreet
voice
floated
up
with
the
faintest
tinge
of
effrontery
out
of
the
hush
â€˜is
that
dr
ferguson
too
sirâ€™
â€˜no
ada
and
please
tell
your
mistress
from
me
that
dr
ferguson
is
unlikely
to
call
againâ€™
a
keen
but
rather
forlorn
smile
passed
over
his
face
â€˜heâ€™s
dining
with
friends
no
doubt
at
holloway
but
of
course
if
she
should
want
to
see
him
he
will
see
her
to-morrow
at
any
hour
at
mrs
lovatâ€™s
and--adaâ€™
â€˜yes
sirâ€™
â€˜say
that
iâ€™m
a
little
better
your
mistress
will
be
relieved
to
hear
that
iâ€™m
a
little
better
still
not
quite
myself
say
but
i
think
a
little
betterâ€™
â€˜yes
sir
and
iâ€™m
sure
iâ€™m
very
glad
to
hear
itâ€™
came
fainter
still
â€˜what
voice
was
that
i
heard
just
nowâ€™
â€˜miss
aliceâ€™s
sir
but
she
came
quite
against
my
wishes

i
hope
you
wonâ€™t
repeat
it

promised
if
she
came
that
mistress
shouldnâ€™t
know
i
was
only
afraid
she
might
disturb
you

dr
ferguson

did
you
say
sir
that
i
was
to
tell
mistress
that
he
might
be
coming
backâ€™
â€˜ah
that
i
donâ€™t
know
so
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
not
to
mention
him
at
all

alice
thereâ€™
â€˜i
said
i
would
tell
her
if
you
were
alone
but
i
hope
youâ€™ll
understand
that
it
was
only
because
she
begged
so
mistress
has
gone
to
st
peterâ€™s
bazaar
and
thatâ€™s
how
it
wasâ€™
â€˜i
quite
understand
beckon
to
herâ€™
there
came
a
hasty
step
in
the
hall
and
a
hurried
murmur
of
explanation
lawford
heard
her
call
as
she
ran
up
the
stairs
and
the
next
moment
he
had
aliceâ€™s
hand
in
his
and
they
were
groping
together
through
the
gloaming
back
into
the
solitude
of
the
empty
room
again
â€˜donâ€™t
be
alarmed
dearâ€™
he
heard
himself
imploring
just
hold
tight
to
that
clear
common
sense
and
above
all
you
wonâ€™t
tell
it
must
be
our
secret
a
dead
dead
secret
from
every
one
even
your
mother
for
just
a
little
while
just
a
mere
two
days
or
so--in
case
iâ€™m--iâ€™m
better
dearâ€™
he
fumbled
with
the
little
box
of
matches
dropped
one
broke
another
but
at
last
the
candle-flame
dipped
brightened
and
with
the
door
shut
and
the
last
pale
blueness
of
dusk
at
the
window
lawford
turned
and
looked
at
his
daughter
she
stood
with
eyes
wide
open
like
the
eyes
of
a
child
walking
in
its
sleep
then
twisted
her
fingers
more
tightly
within
his
â€˜oh
dearest
how
ill
how
ill
you
lookâ€™
she
whispered
â€˜but
there
never
mind--never
mind
it
was
all
a
miserable
dream
then
it
wonâ€™t
it
canâ€™t
come
back
i
donâ€™t
think
i
could
bear
its
coming
back
and
mother
told
me
such
curious
things
as
if
i
were
a
child
and
understood
nothing
and
even
after
i
knew
that
you
were
you--i
mean
before
i
sat
up
here
in
the
dark
to
see
you--she
said
that
you
were
gone
and
would
never
come
back
that
a
terrible
thing
had
happened--a
disgrace
which
we
must
never
speak
of
and
that
all
the
other
was
only
a
pretence
to
keep
people
from
talking
but
i
did
not
believe
then
and
how
could
i
believe
afterwardsâ€™
â€˜there
never
mind
now
dear
what
she
said
it
was
all
meant
for
the
best
perhaps
but
here
i
am
and
not
nearly
so
ill
as
i
look
alice
and
thereâ€™s
nothing
more
to
trouble
ourselves
about
not
even
if
it
should
be
necessary
for
me
to
go
away
for
a
time
and
this
is
our
secret
mind
ours
only
just
a
dead
secret
between
you
and
meâ€™
they
sat
for
awhile
without
speaking
or
stirring
and
faintly
along
the
hushed
road
lawford
heard
in
the
silence
a
leisurely
indolent
beat
of
little
hoofs
approaching
and
the
sound
of
wheels
a
sudden
wave
of
feeling
swept
over
him
he
took
aliceâ€™s
quiet
loving
face
in
his
hands
and
kissed
her
passionately
â€˜do
not
so
much
as
think
of
me
yet
or
doubt
or
question
only
love
me
dearest
and
soon--and
soon--â€™
â€˜weâ€™ll
just
begin
again
just
begin
again
wonâ€™t
we
all
three
of
us
together
just
as
we
used
to
be
i
didnâ€™t
mean
to
have
said
all
those
horrid
things
about
mother
she
was
only
dreadfully
anxious
and
meant
everything
for
the
best
youâ€™ll
let
me
tell
her
soonâ€™
the
haggard
face
turned
slowly
listening
â€˜i
hear
i
understand
but
i
canâ€™t
think
very
clearly
now
alice
i
canâ€™t
dear
my
miserable
old
tangled
nerves
i
just
stumble
along
as
best
i
can
youâ€™ll
understand
better
when
you
get
to
be
a
poor
old
thing
like
me
we
must
do
the
best
we
can
and
of
course
youâ€™ll
see
dillie
how
awfully
important
it
is
not
to
raise
false
hopes
you
understand
i
mustnâ€™t
risk
the
least
thing
in
the
world
must
i
and
now
goodbye
only
for
a
few
hours
now
and
not
a
word
not
a
word
to
a
single
living
soulâ€™
he
extinguished
the
candle
again
and
led
the
way
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
â€˜are
you
there
adaâ€™
â€˜yes
sirâ€™
answered
the
quiet
imperturbable
voice
from
under
the
black
straw
brim
alice
went
slowly
down
but
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
looking
out
into
the
cold
blue
lamplit
street
she
paused
as
if
at
a
sudden
recollection
and
ran
hastily
up
again
â€˜there
was
nothing
more
dearâ€™
she
said
leaning
back
to
peer
up
â€˜â€œnothing
moreâ€
whatâ€™
she
stood
panting
a
little
in
the
darkness
listening
to
some
cautious
yet
uneasy
thought
that
seemed
to
haunt
her
mind
â€˜i
thought--it
seemed
there
was
something
we
had
not
said
something
i
could
not
understand
but
there
it
is
nothing
you
know
what
a
fanciful
old
silly
i
am
you
do
love
me
quite
as
much
as
everâ€™
â€˜more
sweetheart
moreâ€™
â€˜good-night
again
then
and
god
bless
you
dearâ€™
the
outer
door
closed
softly
the
footsteps
died
away
lawford
still
hesitated
he
took
hold
of
the
stairs
above
his
head
as
he
stood
on
the
landing
and
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hands
striving
calmly
to
disentangle
the
perplexity
of
his
thoughts
his
pulses
were
beating
in
his
ear
with
a
low
muffled
roar
he
looked
down
between
the
blinds
to
where
against
the
blue
of
the
road
beneath
the
straggling
yellow
beams
of
the
lamp
stood
the
little
cart
and
drooping
shaggy
pony
and
grisel
sitting
quietly
there
awaiting
him
he
shut
his
eyes
as
if
in
hope
by
some
convulsive
effort
of
mind
to
break
through
this
subtle
glasslike
atmosphere
of
dream
that
had
stolen
over
consciousness
and
blotted
out
the
significance
almost
the
meaning
of
the
past
he
turned
abruptly
empty
as
the
empty
rooms
around
him
unanswering
were
mind
and
heart
life
was
a
tale
told
by
an
idiot--signifying
nothing
he
paused
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
and
even
then
the
doubt
confronted
him
would
he
ever
come
back
who
knows
he
thought
and
again
stood
pondering
arguing
denying
at
last
he
seemed
to
have
come
to
a
decision
he
made
his
way
downstairs
opened
and
left
ajar
a
long
narrow
window
in
a
passage
to
the
garden
beyond
the
kitchen
he
turned
on
his
heel
as
he
reached
the
gate
and
waved
his
hand
as
if
in
a
kind
of
forlorn
mockery
towards
the
darkly
glittering
windows
the
drowsy
pony
awoke
at
touch
of
the
whip
grisel
lifted
the
rug
and
squeezed
a
little
closer
into
the
corner
she
had
drawn
a
veil
over
her
face
so
that
to
lawford
her
eyes
seemed
to
be
dreaming
in
a
little
darkness
of
their
own
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
side
of
the
cart
â€˜itâ€™s
a
most
curious
thingâ€™
he
said
â€˜but
peeping
down
at
you
just
now
when
the
sound
of
the
wheels
came
a
memory
came
clearly
back
to
me
of
years
and
years
ago--of
my
mother
she
used
to
come
to
fetch
me
at
school
in
a
little
cart
like
this
and
a
little
pony
just
like
this
with
a
thick
dusty
coat
and
once
i
remember
i
was
simply
sick
of
everything
a
failure
and
fagged
out
and
all
that
and
was
looking
out
in
the
twilight
i
fancy
even
it
was
autumn
too
it
was
a
little
side
staircase
window
i
was
horribly
homesick
and
she
came
quite
unexpectedly
i
shall
never
forget
it--the
misery
and
then
her
comingâ€™
he
lifted
his
eyes
cowed
with
the
incessant
struggle
and
watched
her
face
for
some
time
in
silence
â€˜ought
i
to
stayâ€™
â€˜i
see
no
â€œoughtâ€â€™
she
said
â€˜no
one
is
thereâ€™
â€˜only
a
miserable
broken
voice
out
of
a
broken
cage--called
conscienceâ€™
â€˜donâ€™t
you
think
perhaps
that
even
that
has
a
good
many
disguises--convention
cowardice
weakness
ennui
they
all
take
their
turn
at
hooting
in
its
feathers
you
must
you
really
must
have
rest
you
donâ€™t
know
you
donâ€™t
see
i
do
just
a
little
snap
some
one
last
exquisite
thread
gives
way
and
then
it
is
all
over
you
see
i
have
even
to
try
to
frighten
you
for
i
canâ€™t
tell
you
how
you
distress
meâ€™
â€˜why
do
i
distress
you--my
face
my
story
you
meanâ€™
â€˜no
i
mean
you
your
trouble
that
horrible
empty
house
and--oh
dear
me
yes
your
courage
tooâ€™
â€˜listenâ€™
said
lawford
stooping
forward
he
could
scarcely
see
the
pale
veiled
face
through
this
mist
that
had
risen
up
over
his
eyes
â€˜i
have
no
courage
apart
from
you
no
courage
and
no
hope
ask
me
to
come--a
stranger
with
no
history
no
mockery
no
miserable
rant
of
a
grave
and
darkness
and
fear
behind
me
are
we
not
all
haunted--every
one
that
forgotten
and
the
fool
i
was
and
the
vacillating
and
the
pretence--oh
how
it
all
sweeps
clear
before
me
without
a
will
without
a
hope
or
glimpse
or
whisper
of
courage
be
just
the
memory
of
my
mother
the
face
the
friend
iâ€™ve
never
seen
the
voice
that
every
dream
leaves
echoing
ask
me
to
comeâ€™
she
sat
unstirring
and
then
as
if
by
some
uncontrollable
impulse
stooped
a
little
closer
to
him
and
laid
her
gloved
hand
on
his
â€˜i
hear
you
know
i
hear
tooâ€™
she
whispered
â€˜but
we
mustnâ€™t
listen
come
now
itâ€™s
growing
lateâ€™
the
little
village
echoed
back
from
its
stone
walls
the
clatter
of
the
ponyâ€™s
hoofs
night
had
darkened
to
its
deepest
when
their
lamp
shone
white
on
the
wicket
in
the
hedge
they
had
scarcely
spoken
lawford
had
simply
watched
pass
by
almost
without
a
thought
the
arching
trees
the
darkening
fields
had
watched
rise
up
in
a
mist
of
primrose
light
the
harvest
moon
to
shine
in
saffron
on
the
faces
and
shoulders
of
the
few
wayfarers
they
met
or
who
passed
them
by
the
still
grave
face
beneath
the
shadow
of
its
veil
had
never
turned
though
the
moon
poured
all
her
flood
of
brilliance
upon
the
dark
profile
and
once
when
as
if
in
sudden
alarm
he
had
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
her
a
sudden
doubt
had
assailed
him
so
instantly
that
he
had
half
put
out
his
hand
to
touch
her
and
had
as
quickly
withdrawn
it
lest
her
beauty
and
stillness
should
be
even
as
the
momentâ€™s
fancy
had
suggested
only
a
far-gone
memory
returned
in
dream
herbert
hailed
them
from
the
darkness
of
an
open
window
he
came
down
and
they
talked
a
little
in
the
cold
air
of
the
garden
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
climbed
languidly
into
the
cart
and
drove
the
drowsy
little
pony
off
into
the
moonlight
it
was
a
quiet
supper
the
three
friends
sat
down
to
herbert
sat
narrowing
his
eyes
over
his
thoughts
which
when
the
fancy
took
him
he
scattered
out
upon
the
othersâ€™
silence
lawford
apparently
had
not
yet
shaken
himself
free
from
the
sorcery
of
the
moonlight
his
eyes
shone
dark
and
full
like
those
of
a
child
who
has
trespassed
beyond
its
hour
for
bed
and
sits
marvelling
at
reality
in
a
waking
dream
long
after
they
had
bidden
each
other
good-night
long
after
herbert
had
trodden
on
tiptoe
with
his
candle
past
his
closed
door
lawford
sat
leaning
on
his
arms
at
the
open
window
staring
out
across
the
motionless
moonlit
trees
that
seemed
to
stand
like
draped
and
dreaming
pilgrims
come
to
the
peace
of
their
nirvana
at
last
beside
the
crashing
music
of
the
waters
and
he
himself
the
self
that
never
sleeps
beneath
the
tides
and
waves
of
consciousness
was
listening
too
almost
as
unmovedly
and
unheedingly
to
the
thoughts
that
clashed
in
conflict
through
his
brain
why
in
a
strange
transitory
life
was
one
the
slave
of
these
small
cares
what
if
even
in
that
dark
pit
beneath
which
seemed
to
whisper
lethe
to
the
tumultuous
swirling
waters--what
if
there
too
were
merely
a
beginning
again
and
to
seek
a
slumbering
refuge
there
merely
a
blind
and
reiterated
plunge
into
the
heat
and
tumult
of
another
day
who
was
that
poor
dark
homeless
ghoul
sabathier
who
was
this
helen
of
an
impossible
dream
her
face
with
its
strange
smile
her
eyes
with
their
still
pity
and
rapt
courage
had
taken
hope
away
â€˜hereâ€™s
not
your
restâ€™
cried
one
insistent
voice
â€˜she
is
the
mystery
that
haunts
day
and
night
past
all
the
changing
of
the
restless
hours
chance
has
given
you
back
eyes
to
see
a
heart
that
can
be
broken
chance
and
the
stirrings
of
a
long-gone
life
have
torn
down
the
veil
age
spins
so
thick
and
fast
pride
and
ambition
what
dull
fools
men
are
effort
and
duty
what
dull
fools
men
areâ€™
he
listened
on
and
on
to
these
phantom
pleadings
and
to
the
rather
coarse
old
lawford
conscience
grunting
them
mercilessly
down
too
weary
even
to
try
to
rest
rooks
at
dawn
came
sweeping
beneath
the
turquoise
of
the
sky
he
saw
their
sharp-beaked
heads
turn
this
way
that
way
as
they
floated
on
outspread
wings
across
the
misty
world
except
for
the
hoarse
roar
of
the
water
under
the
huge
thin-leafed
trees
not
a
sound
was
stirring
â€˜one
thingâ€™
he
seemed
to
hear
himself
mutter
as
he
turned
with
a
shiver
from
the
morning
air
â€˜it
wonâ€™t
be
for
long
you
can
at
least
poor
devil
wait
the
last
act
outâ€™
if
in
this
foolish
hustling
mob
of
the
world
hired
anywhere
and
anywhen
for
the
one
poor
dubious
wage
of
a
penny--if
it
was
only
his
own
small
dull
part
to
carry
a
mock
spear
and
shout
huzza
with
the
rest--there
was
nothing
for
it
he
grunted
obstinately
to
himself
shout
he
would
with
the
loudest
he
threw
himself
on
to
the
bed
with
eyes
so
wearied
with
want
of
sleep
it
seemed
they
had
lost
their
livelong
skill
in
finding
it
not
the
echo
of
triumph
nor
even
a
sigh
of
relief
stirred
the
torpor
of
his
mind
he
knew
vaguely
that
what
had
been
the
misery
and
madness
of
the
last
few
days
was
gone
but
the
thought
had
no
power
to
move
him
now
sheilaâ€™s
good
sense
and
mr
bethanyâ€™s
stubborn
loyalty
were
alike
old
stories
that
had
lost
their
savour
and
meaning
gone
too
was
the
need
for
that
portentous
family
gathering
that
had
sat
so
often
in
his
fancy
during
these
last
few
days
around
his
dining-room
table
discussing
with
futile
decorum
the
problem
of
how
to
hush
him
up
to
muffle
him
down
half
dreaming
half
awake
he
saw
the
familiar
door
slowly
open
and
like
the
timely
hero
in
a
melodrama
his
own
figure
appear
before
the
stricken
and
astonished
company
his
eyes
opened
half-fearfully
and
glanced
up
in
the
morning
twilight
their
perplexity
gave
place
to
a
quiet
almost
vacant
smile
the
lids
slowly
closed
again
and
at
last
the
lean
hands
twitched
awhile
in
sleep
next
morning
he
spent
rummaging
among
the
old
books
dipping
listlessly
here
and
there
as
the
tasteless
fancy
took
him
while
herbert
sat
writing
with
serene
face
and
lifted
eyebrows
at
his
open
window
but
the
unfamiliar
long
sâ€™s
the
close
type
and
the
spelling
of
the
musty
old
books
wearied
eye
and
mind
what
he
read
too
however
far-fetched
or
lively
or
sententious
or
gross
seemed
either
to
be
of
the
same
texture
as
what
had
become
his
everyday
experience
and
so
baffled
him
with
its
nearness
or
else
was
only
the
meaningless
ramblings
of
an
idle
pen
and
this
he
thought
to
himself
looking
covertly
up
at
the
spruce
clear-cut
profile
at
the
window
this
is
what
herbert
had
called
life
â€˜am
i
interrupting
you
herbert
are
you
very
busyâ€™
he
asked
at
last
taking
refuge
on
a
chair
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room
â€˜bless
me
no
not
a
bit--not
a
bitâ€™
said
herbert
amiably
laying
down
his
pen
â€˜iâ€™m
afraid
the
old
leatherjackets
have
been
boring
you
itâ€™s
a
habit
this
beastly
reading
this
gorge
and
glint
and
fever
all
at
second-hand--purely
a
bad
habit
like
morphia
like
laudanum
but
once
in
you
know
thereâ€™s
no
recovery
anyhow
iâ€™m
neck-deep
and
to
struggle
would
be
simply
to
drownâ€™
â€˜i
was
only
going
to
say
how
sorry
i
am
for
having
left
sabathier
at
homeâ€™
â€˜my
dear
fellow--â€™
began
herbert
reassuringly
â€˜it
was
only
because
i
wanted
so
very
much
to
have
your
translation
i
get
muddled
up
with
other
things
groping
through
the
dictionaryâ€™
herbert
surveyed
him
critically
â€˜what
exactly
is
your
interest
now
lawford
you
donâ€™t
mean
that
my
old
â€œtheoryâ€
has
left
any
sting
nowâ€™
â€˜no
sting
oh
no
i
was
only
curious
but
you
yourself
still
think
it
really
donâ€™t
youâ€™
herbert
turned
for
a
moment
to
the
open
window
â€˜i
was
simply
trying
then
to
find
something
to
fit
the
facts
as
you
experienced
them
but
now
that
the
facts
have
gone--and
they
have
havenâ€™t
they--exit
of
course
my
theoryâ€™
â€˜i
seeâ€™
was
the
cryptic
answer
â€˜and
yet
herbertâ€™
lawford
solemnly
began
again
â€˜it
has
changed
me
even
in
my
way
of
thinking
when
i
shut
my
eyes
now--i
only
discovered
it
by
chance--i
see
immediately
faces
quite
strange
to
me
or
places
sometimes
thronged
with
people
and
once
an
old
well
with
some
one
sitting
in
the
shadow
i
canâ€™t
tell
you
how
clearly
and
yet
it
is
all
altogether
different
from
a
dream
even
when
i
sit
with
my
eyes
open
i
am
conscious
as
it
were
of
a
kind
of
faint
colourless
mirage
in
the
old
days--i
mean
before
widderstone
what
i
saw
was
only
what
iâ€™d
seen
already
nothing
came
uncalled
for
unexplained
this
makes
the
old
life
seem
so
blank
i
did
not
know
what
extraordinarily
real
things
i
was
doing
without
and
whether
for
that
reason
or
another
i
canâ€™t
quite
make
out
what
in
fact
i
did
want
then
and
was
always
fretting
and
striving
for
i
can
see
no
wisdom
or
purpose
in
anything
now
but
to
get
to
oneâ€™s
journeyâ€™s
end
as
quickly
and
bravely
as
one
can
and
even
then
even
if
we
do
call
life
a
journey
and
death
the
inn
we
shall
reach
at
last
in
the
evening
when
itâ€™s
over
that
too
i
feel
will
be
only
as
brief
a
stopping-place
as
any
other
inn
would
be
our
experience
here
is
so
scanty
and
shallow--nothing
more
than
the
moment
of
the
continual
present
surely
that
must
go
on
even
if
one
does
call
it
eternity
and
so
we
shall
all
have
to
begin
again
probably
sabathier
himself
but
there
what
on
earth
are
we
herbert
when
all
is
said
who
is
it
has--has
done
all
this
for
us--what
kind
of
self
and
to
what
possible
end
is
it
that
the
clockwork
has
been
wound
up
and
must
still
jolt
on
a
while
with
jarring
wheels
will
it
never
run
down
do
you
thinkâ€™
herbert
smiled
faintly
but
made
no
answer
â€˜you
seeâ€™
continued
lawford
in
the
same
quiet
dispassionate
undertone
â€˜i
wouldnâ€™t
mind
if
it
was
only
myself
but
there
are
so
many
of
us
so
many
selves
i
mean
and
they
all
seem
to
have
a
voice
in
the
matter
what
is
the
reality
to
this
infernal
dreamâ€™
â€˜the
reality
is
lawford
that
you
are
fretting
your
life
out
over
this
rotten
illusion
be
guided
by
me
just
this
once
weâ€™ll
go
all
three
of
us
a
good
ten-mile
walk
to-day
and
thoroughly
tire
you
out
and
to-night
you
shall
sleep
here--a
really
sound
refreshing
sleep
then
to-morrow
whole
and
hale
back
you
shall
go
honestly
itâ€™s
only
professional
strong
men
should
ask
questions
babes
like
you
and
me
must
keep
to
slopsâ€™
so
though
lawford
made
no
answer
it
was
agreed
before
noon
the
three
of
them
had
set
out
on
their
walk
across
the
fields
and
after
rambling
on
just
as
caprice
took
them
past
reddening
blackberry
bushes
and
copses
of
hazel
and
flaming
beech
they
sat
down
to
spread
out
their
meal
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
overlooking
quiet
ploughed
fields
and
grazing
cattle
herbert
stretched
himself
with
his
back
to
the
earth
and
his
placid
face
to
the
pale
vacant
sky
while
lawford
even
more
dispirited
after
his
walk
wandered
up
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
upon
the
other
side
lay
a
farm
and
its
out-buildings
and
a
pool
of
water
beneath
a
group
of
elms
it
was
vacant
in
the
sunlight
and
the
water
vividly
green
with
a
scum
of
weed
and
about
half
a
mile
beyond
stood
a
cluster
of
cottages
and
an
old
towered
church
he
gazed
idly
down
listening
vaguely
to
the
wailing
of
a
curlew
flitting
anxiously
to
and
fro
above
the
broken
solitude
of
its
green
hill
and
it
seemed
as
if
a
thin
and
dark
cloud
began
to
be
quietly
withdrawn
from
over
his
eyes
hill
and
wailing
cry
and
barn
and
water
faded
out
and
he
was
staring
as
if
in
an
endless
stillness
at
an
open
window
against
which
the
sun
was
beating
in
a
bristling
torrent
of
gold
while
out
of
the
garden
beyond
came
the
voice
of
some
evening
bird
singing
with
such
an
unspeakable
ecstasy
of
grief
it
seemed
it
must
be
perched
upon
the
confines
of
another
world
the
light
gathered
to
a
radiance
almost
intolerable
driving
back
with
its
raining
beams
some
memory
forlorn
remorseless
remote
his
body
stood
dark
and
senseless
rocking
in
the
air
on
the
hillside
as
if
bereft
of
its
spirit
then
his
hands
were
drawn
over
his
eyes
he
turned
unsteadily
and
made
his
way
as
if
through
a
thick
drizzling
haze
slowly
back
â€˜what
is
that--thereâ€™
he
said
almost
menacingly
standing
with
bloodshot
eyes
looking
down
upon
herbert
â€˜â€œthatâ€--whatâ€™
said
herbert
glancing
up
startled
from
his
book
â€˜why
whatâ€™s
wrong
lawfordâ€™
â€˜thatâ€™
said
lawford
sullenly
yet
with
a
faintly
mournful
cadence
in
his
voice
â€˜those
fields
and
that
old
empty
farm--that
village
over
there
why
did
you
bring
me
hereâ€™
grisel
had
not
stirred
â€˜the
villageâ€™
â€˜sshâ€™
she
said
catching
her
brotherâ€™s
sleeve
â€˜thatâ€™s
detcham
yes
detchamâ€™
lawford
turned
wide
vacant
eyes
on
her
he
shook
his
head
and
shuddered
â€˜no
no
not
detcham
i
know
it
i
know
it
but
it
has
gone
out
of
my
mind
not
detcham
iâ€™ve
been
there
before
donâ€™t
look
at
me
horrible
horrible
it
takes
me
back--i
canâ€™t
think
i
stood
there
trying
trying
itâ€™s
all
in
a
blur
donâ€™t
ask
me--a
dreamâ€™
grisel
leaned
forward
and
touched
his
hand
â€˜donâ€™t
think
donâ€™t
even
try
why
should
you
we
canâ€™t
we
mustnâ€™t
go
backâ€™
lawford
still
gazing
fixedly
turned
again
a
darkened
face
towards
the
steep
of
the
hill
â€˜i
think
you
knowâ€™
he
said
stooping
and
whispering
â€˜he
would
know--the
window
and
the
sun
and
the
singing
and
oh
of
course
it
was
too
late
you
understand--too
late
and
once
you
canâ€™t
go
back
oh
no
you
wonâ€™t
leave
me
you
see
if
you
go
it
would
only
be
all
i
could
not
be
quite
so
alone
but
detcham--detcham
perhaps
you
will
not
trust
me--tell
me
that
was
not
the
nameâ€™
he
shuddered
violently
and
turned
dog-like
beseeching
eyes
â€˜to-morrow--yes
to-morrowâ€™
he
said
â€˜i
will
promise
anything
if
you
will
not
leave
me
now
once--â€™
but
again
the
thread
running
so
faintly
through
that
inextricable
maze
of
memory
eluded
him
â€˜so
long
as
you
wonâ€™t
leave
me
nowâ€™
he
implored
her
she
was
vainly
trying
to
win
back
her
composure
and
could
not
answer
him
at
once
in
the
evening
after
supper
grisel
sat
her
guest
down
in
front
of
a
big
wood
fire
in
the
old
book-room
where
staring
into
the
playing
flames
he
could
fall
at
peace
into
the
almost
motionless
reverie
which
he
seemed
merely
to
harass
and
weary
himself
by
trying
to
disperse
she
opened
the
little
piano
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
and
played
on
and
on
as
fancy
led--chopin
and
beethoven
a
fugue
from
bach
and
lovely
forlorn
old
english
airs
till
the
music
seemed
not
only
a
voice
persuading
pondering
and
lamenting
but
gathered
about
itself
the
hollow
surge
of
the
water
and
the
darkness
wistful
and
clear
as
the
thoughts
of
a
solitary
child
ever
and
again
a
log
burnt
through
its
strength
and
falling
amid
sparks
stirred
like
a
restless
animal
the
stillness
or
herbert
in
his
corner
lifted
his
head
to
glance
towards
his
visitor
and
to
turn
another
page
at
last
the
music
too
fell
silent
and
lawford
stood
up
with
his
candle
in
his
hand
and
eyed
with
a
strange
fixity
brother
and
sister
his
glance
wandered
slowly
round
the
quiet
flame-lit
room
â€˜you
wonâ€™tâ€™
he
said
stooping
towards
them
as
if
in
extreme
confidence
â€˜you
wonâ€™t
much
notice
they
come
and
go
i
try
not
to--to
speak
itâ€™s
the
only
way
through
it
is
not
that
i
donâ€™t
know
theyâ€™re
only
dreams
but
if
once
the--the
others
thought
there
had
been
any
tamperingâ€™--he
tapped
his
forehead
meaningly--â€˜here
if
once
they
thought
that
it
would
you
know
be
quite
over
then
how
could
i
proveâ€™
he
turned
cautiously
towards
the
door
and
with
laborious
significance
nodded
his
head
at
them
herbert
bent
down
and
held
out
his
long
hands
to
the
fire
â€˜tampering
my
dear
chap
thatâ€™s
what
the
lump
said
to
the
leavenâ€™
â€˜yes
yesâ€™
said
lawford
putting
out
his
hand
â€˜but
you
know
what
i
mean
herbert
anything
i
tried
to
do
then
would
be
quite
quite
hopeless
that
would
be
poisoning
the
wellsâ€™
they
watched
him
out
of
the
room
and
listened
till
quite
distinctly
in
the
still
night-shaded
house
they
heard
his
door
gently
close
then
as
if
by
consent
they
turned
and
looked
long
and
questioningly
into
each
otherâ€™s
faces
â€˜then
you
are
not
afraidâ€™
herbert
said
quietly
grisel
gazed
steadily
on
and
almost
imperceptibly
shook
her
head
â€˜you
meanâ€™
he
questioned
her
but
still
he
had
again
to
read
her
answer
in
her
eyes
â€˜oh
very
well
griselâ€™
he
said
quietly
â€˜you
know
bestâ€™
and
returned
once
more
to
his
writing
for
an
hour
or
two
lawford
slept
heavily
so
heavily
that
when
a
little
after
midnight
he
awoke
with
his
face
towards
the
uncurtained
window
though
for
many
minutes
he
lay
brightly
confronting
all
orion
that
from
blazing
helm
to
flaming
dog
at
heel
filled
high
the
glimmering
square
he
could
not
lift
or
stir
his
cold
and
leaden
limbs
he
rose
at
last
and
threw
off
the
burden
of
his
bedclothes
and
rested
awhile
as
if
freed
from
the
heaviness
of
an
unrememberable
nightmare
but
so
clear
was
his
mind
and
so
extraordinarily
refreshed
he
seemed
in
body
that
sleep
for
many
hours
would
not
return
again
and
he
spent
almost
all
the
remainder
of
the
lagging
darkness
pacing
softly
to
and
fro
one
face
only
before
his
eyes
the
one
sure
thing
the
one
thing
unattainable
in
a
world
of
phantoms
herbert
waited
on
in
vain
for
his
guest
next
morning
and
after
wandering
up
and
down
the
mossy
lawn
at
the
back
of
the
house
went
off
cheerfully
at
last
alone
for
his
dip
when
he
returned
lawford
was
in
his
place
at
the
breakfast-table
he
sat
on
moody
and
constrained
until
even
herbertâ€™s
haphazard
talk
trickled
low
â€˜i
fancy
my
sister
is
nursing
a
headacheâ€™
he
said
at
last
â€˜but
sheâ€™ll
be
down
soon
and
iâ€™m
afraid
from
the
looks
of
you
lawford
your
night
was
not
particularly
restfulâ€™
he
felt
his
way
very
heedfully
â€˜perhaps
we
walked
you
a
little
too
far
yesterday
we
are
so
used
to
tramping
that--â€™
lawford
kept
thoughtful
eyes
fixed
on
the
deprecating
face
â€˜i
see
what
it
is
herbert--you
are
humouring
me
again
i
have
been
wracking
my
brains
in
vain
to
remember
what
exactly
did
happen
yesterday
i
feel
as
if
it
was
all
sunk
oceans
deep
in
sleep
i
get
so
far--and
then
iâ€™m
done
it
wonâ€™t
give
up
a
hint
but
you
really
mustnâ€™t
think
iâ€™m
an
invalid
or--or
in
my
second
childhood
the
truth
isâ€™
he
added
â€˜itâ€™s
only
my
first
come
back
again
but
now
that
iâ€™ve
got
so
far
now
that
iâ€™m
really
better
i--â€™
he
broke
off
rather
vacantly
as
if
afraid
of
his
own
confidence
â€˜i
must
be
getting
onâ€™
he
summed
up
with
an
effort
â€˜and
thatâ€™s
the
solemn
fact
i
keep
on
forgetting
iâ€™m--iâ€™m
a
ratepayerâ€™
herbert
sat
round
in
his
chair
â€˜you
see
lawford
the
very
term
is
little
else
than
double-dutch
to
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
grisel
sends
all
my
hush-money
to
the
horrible
people
that
do
the
cleaning
up
as
it
were
i
canâ€™t
catch
their
drift
government
to
me
is
merely
the
spectacle
of
the
clever
or
the
specious
managing
the
dull
it
deals
merely
with
the
physical
and
just
the
fringe
of
consciousness
i
am
not
joking
i
think
i
follow
you
all
i
mean
is
that
the
obligations--mainly
tepid
i
take
it--that
are
luring
you
back
to
the
fold
would
be
the
very
ones
that
would
scare
me
quickest
off
the
imagination
the
appeal
faded
weâ€™re
deadâ€™
lawford
opened
his
mouth
â€˜temporarily
tepidâ€™
he
at
last
all
but
coughed
out
â€˜oh
yes
of
courseâ€™
said
herbert
intelligently
â€˜only
temporarily
itâ€™s
this
beastly
gregariousness
thatâ€™s
the
devil
the
very
thought
of
it
undoes
me--with
an
absolute
shock
of
sheepishness
i
suddenly
realise
my
human
nakedness
that
here
we
are
little
better
than
naked
animals
bleating
behind
our
illusory
wattles
on
the
slopes
of--of
infinity
and
nakedness
after
all
is
a
wholesome
thing
to
realize
only
when
one
thinks
too
much
of
oneâ€™s
clothes
i
peer
sometimes
feebly
enough
out
of
my
wool
and
it
seems
to
me
that
all
these
busybodies
all
these
fact-devourers
all
this
news-reading
rabble
are
nothing
brighter
than
very
dull-witted
children
trying
to
play
an
imaginative
game
much
too
deep
for
their
poor
reasons
i
donâ€™t
mean
that
your
wanting
to
go
home
is
anything
gregarious
but
i
do
think
their
insisting
on
your
coming
back
at
once
might
be
and
i
know
you
wonâ€™t
visit
this
stuff
on
me
as
anything
more
than
just
my
â€œscumâ€
as
grisel
calls
the
fine
flower
of
my
maiden
meditations
all
that
i
really
want
to
say
is
that
we
should
both
be
more
than
delighted
if
youâ€™d
stay
just
as
long
as
it
will
not
be
a
bore
for
you
to
stay
stay
till
youâ€™re
heartily
tired
of
us
go
back
now
if
you
must
tell
them
how
much
better
you
are
bolt
off
to
a
nerve
specialist
heâ€™ll
say
complete
rest--change
of
scene
and
all
that
they
all
do
instinct
via
intellect
and
why
not
take
your
rest
here
we
are
such
miserably
dull
company
to
one
another
it
would
be
a
greater
pleasure
to
have
you
with
us
than
i
can
say
i
mean
it
from
the
very
bottom
of
my
heart
doâ€™
lawford
listened
â€˜i
wish--â€™
he
began
and
stopped
dead
again
â€˜anyhow
iâ€™ll
go
back
i
am
afraid
herbert
iâ€™ve
been
playing
truant
it
was
all
very
well
while--to
tell
you
the
truth
i
canâ€™t
think
quite
straight
yet
but
it
wonâ€™t
last
for
ever
besides--well
anyhow
iâ€™ll
go
backâ€™
â€˜right
you
areâ€™
said
herbert
pretending
to
be
cheerful
â€˜you
canâ€™t
expect
you
really
canâ€™t
everything
to
come
right
straight
away
just
have
patience
and
now
letâ€™s
go
out
and
sit
in
the
sun
theyâ€™ve
mixed
september
up
with
mayâ€™
and
about
half
an
hour
afterwards
he
glanced
up
from
his
book
to
find
his
visitor
fast
asleep
in
his
garden
chair
grisel
had
taken
her
brotherâ€™s
place
with
a
little
pile
of
needlework
beside
her
on
the
grass
when
lawford
again
opened
his
eyes
under
the
rosy
shade
of
a
parasol
he
watched
her
for
a
while
without
speaking
â€˜how
long
have
i
been
asleepâ€™
he
said
at
last
she
started
and
looked
up
from
her
needle
â€˜that
depends
on
how
long
you
have
been
awakeâ€™
she
said
smiling
â€˜my
brother
tells
meâ€™
she
went
on
beginning
to
stitch
â€˜that
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
leave
us
to-day
perhaps
we
are
only
flattering
ourselves
it
has
been
a
rest
but
if
it
has--is
that
do
you
think
quite
wiseâ€™
he
leant
forward
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
â€˜itâ€™s
because--itâ€™s
because
itâ€™s
the
only
â€œmustâ€
i
can
seeâ€™
â€˜but
even
â€œmustsâ€--well
we
have
to
be
sure
even
of
â€œmustsâ€
havenâ€™t
we
are
youâ€™
she
glanced
up
and
for
an
instant
their
eyes
met
and
the
falling
water
seemed
to
be
sounding
out
of
a
distance
so
remote
it
might
be
but
the
echo
of
a
dream
she
stooped
once
more
over
her
work
â€˜supposingâ€™
he
said
very
slowly
and
almost
as
if
speaking
to
himself
â€˜supposing
sabathier--and
you
know
heâ€™s
merely
like
a
friend
now
one
mustnâ€™t
be
seen
talking
to--supposing
he
came
back
what
thenâ€™
â€˜oh
but
sabathierâ€™s
gone
he
never
really
came
it
was
only
a
fancy--a
mood
it
was
only
you--another
youâ€™
â€˜who
was
that
yesterday
thenâ€™
she
glanced
at
him
swiftly
and
knew
the
question
was
but
a
venture
â€˜yesterdayâ€™
â€˜oh
very
wellâ€™
he
said
fretfully
â€˜you
too
but
if
he
did
if
he
did
come
really
back
â€œpreyâ€
and
allâ€™
â€˜what
is
the
riddleâ€™
she
said
taking
a
deep
breath
and
facing
him
brightly
â€˜would
my
â€œmustâ€
still
be
hisâ€™
the
face
he
raised
to
her
as
he
leaned
forward
under
the
direct
light
of
the
sun
was
so
colourless
cadaverous
and
haggard
the
thought
crossed
her
mind
that
it
did
indeed
seem
little
more
than
a
shadowy
mask
that
but
one
hour
of
darkness
might
dispel
â€˜you
said
you
know
we
did
win
through
why
then
should
we
be
even
thinking
of
defeat
nowâ€™
â€˜â€œweâ€â€™
â€˜oh
no
youâ€™
she
cried
triumphantly
â€˜you
do
not
answer
my
questionâ€™
â€˜nor
you
mine
it
was
a
glorious
victory
is
there
the
ghost
of
a
reason
why
you
should
cast
your
mind
back
is
there
nowâ€™
â€˜onlyâ€™
said
lawford
looking
patiently
up
into
her
face
â€˜only
because
i
love
youâ€™
and
listened
in
the
silence
to
the
words
as
one
may
watch
a
bird
that
has
escaped
for
ever
and
irrevocably
out
of
its
cage
steadily
flying
on
and
on
till
lost
to
sight
for
an
instant
the
grey
eyes
faltered
â€˜but
that
surelyâ€™
she
began
in
a
low
voice
still
steadily
sewing
â€˜that
was
our
compact
last
night--that
you
should
let
me
help
that
you
should
trust
me
just
as
you
trusted
the
mother
years
ago
who
came
in
the
little
cart
with
the
shaggy
dusty
pony
to
the
homesick
boy
watching
at
the
window
perhapsâ€™
she
added
her
fingers
trembling
â€˜in
this
odd
shuffle
of
souls
and
faces
i
am
that
mother
and
most
frightfully
anxious
you
should
not
give
in
why
even
because
of
the
tiredness
even
because
the
cause
seems
vain
you
must
still
fight
on--wouldnâ€™t
she
have
said
it
surely
there
are
prizes
a
daughter
a
career
no
end
and
even
they
gone--still
the
self
undimmed
undaunted
that
took
its
drubbing
like
a
manâ€™
â€˜i
know
you
know
iâ€™m
all
but
crazed
you
see
this
wretched
mind
all
littered
and
broken
down
look
at
me
like
that
then
forget
even
you
have
befriended
me
and
pretended--why
must
i
blunder
on
and
on
like
this
oh
grisel
my
friend
my
friend
if
only
you
loved
meâ€™
tears
clouded
her
eyes
she
turned
vaguely
as
if
for
a
hiding-place
â€˜we
canâ€™t
talk
here
how
mad
the
day
is
listen
listen
i
do--i
do
love
you--mother
and
woman
and
friend--from
the
very
moment
you
came
itâ€™s
all
so
clear
so
clear
that
and
your
miserable
â€œmustâ€
my
friend
come
we
will
go
away
by
ourselves
a
little
and
talk
that
way
iâ€™ll
meet
you
by
the
gateâ€™
she
came
out
into
the
sunlight
and
they
went
through
the
little
gate
together
she
walked
quickly
without
speaking
over
the
bridge
past
a
little
cottage
whose
hollyhocks
leaned
fading
above
its
low
flint
wall
skirting
a
field
of
stubble
she
struck
into
a
wood
by
a
path
that
ran
steeply
up
the
hillside
and
by
and
by
they
came
to
a
glen
where
the
woodmen
of
a
score
of
years
ago
had
felled
the
trees
leaving
a
green
hollow
of
saplings
in
the
midst
of
their
towering
neighbours
â€˜thereâ€™
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
â€˜now
we
are
alone
just
six
hours
or
so--and
then
the
sun
will
be
thereâ€™
she
pointed
to
the
tree-tops
to
the
west
â€˜and
then
you
will
have
to
go
for
good
for
good--you
your
way
and
i
mine
what
a
tangle--a
tangle
is
this
life
of
ours
could
i
have
dreamt
we
should
ever
be
talking
like
this
you
and
i
friends
of
an
hour
what
will
you
think
of
me
does
it
matter
donâ€™t
speak
say
nothing--poor
face
poor
hands
if
only
there
were
something
to
look
to--to
pray
toâ€™
she
bent
over
his
hand
and
pressed
it
to
her
breast
â€˜what
worlds
weâ€™ve
seen
together
you
and
i
and
then--another
partingâ€™
they
wandered
on
a
little
way
and
came
back
and
listened
to
the
first
few
birds
that
flew
up
into
the
higher
branches
noonday
being
past
to
sing
they
talked
and
were
silent
and
talked
again
with
out
question
or
sadness
or
regret
or
reproach
she
mocking
even
at
themselves
mocking
at
this
â€˜changeâ€™--â€˜why
and
yet
without
it
would
you
ever
even
have
dreamed
once
a
poor
fool
of
a
frenchman
went
to
his
restless
grave
for
me--for
me
need
we
understand
were
we
told
to
pry
who
made
us
human
must
be
human
too
why
must
we
take
such
care
and
make
such
a
fret--this
soul
i
know
it
i
know
it
it
is
all
we
have--â€œto
saveâ€
they
say
poor
creatures
no
never
to
spend
and
so
they
darenâ€™t
for
a
solitary
instant
lift
it
on
the
finger
from
its
cage
well
we
have
and
now
soon
back
it
must
go
back
it
must
go
and
try
its
best
to
whistle
the
day
out
and
yet
do
you
know
perhaps
the
very
freedom
does
a
little
shake
its--its
monotony
itâ€™s
true
you
see
they
have
lived
a
long
time
these
worldly
wisefolk
they
were
wise
before
they
were
swaddled
â€˜there
and
you
are
hungryâ€™
she
asked
him
laughing
in
his
eyes
of
course
of
course
you
are--scarcely
a
mouthful
since
that
first
still
wonderful
supper
and
you
havenâ€™t
slept
a
wink
except
like
a
tired-out
child
after
its
first
party
on
that
old
garden
chair
i
sat
and
watched
and
yes
almost
hoped
youâ€™d
never
wake
in
case--in
case
come
along
see
down
there
i
canâ€™t
go
home
just
yet
thereâ€™s
a
little
old
inn--weâ€™ll
go
and
sit
down
there--as
if
we
were
really
trying
to
be
romantic
i
know
the
woman
quite
well
we
can
talk
there--just
the
day
outâ€™
they
sat
at
a
little
table
in
the
garden
of
â€˜the
cherry
treesâ€™
its
thick
green
apple
branches
burdened
with
ripened
fruit
and
grisel
tried
to
persuade
him
to
eat
and
drink
â€˜for
to-morrow
we
dieâ€™
she
said
her
hands
trembling
her
face
as
it
were
veiled
with
a
faint
mysterious
light
â€˜there
are
dozens
and
dozens
of
old
stories
you
knowâ€™
she
said
leaning
on
her
elbows
â€˜dozens
and
dozens
meaning
only
us
you
must
you
must
eat
look
just
an
apple
weâ€™ve
got
to
say
good-bye
and
faintness
will
double
the
difficultyâ€™
she
lightly
touched
his
hand
as
if
to
compel
him
to
smile
with
her
â€˜there
iâ€™ll
peel
it
and
this
is
eden
and
soon
it
will
be
the
cool
of
the
evening
and
then
oh
yes
the
voice
will
come
what
nonsense
i
am
talking
never
mindâ€™
they
sat
on
in
the
quiet
sunshine
and
a
spider
slid
softly
through
the
air
and
with
busy
claws
set
to
its
nets
and
those
small
ghosts
the
robins
went
whistling
restlessly
among
the
heavy
boughs
a
child
presently
came
out
of
the
porch
of
the
inn
into
the
garden
and
stood
with
its
battered
doll
in
its
arms
softly
watching
them
awhile
but
when
grisel
smiled
and
tried
to
coax
her
over
she
burst
out
laughing
and
ran
in
again
lawford
stooped
forward
on
his
chair
with
a
groan
â€˜you
seeâ€™
he
said
â€˜the
whole
world
mocks
me
you
say
â€œthis
eveningâ€
need
it
be
must
it
be
this
evening
if
you
only
knew
how
far
they
have
driven
me
if
you
only
knew
what
we
should
only
detest
each
other
for
saying
and
for
listening
to
the
whole
thingâ€™s
dulled
and
staled
who
wants
a
changeling
who
wants
a
painted
bird
who
does
not
loathe
the
converted--and
iâ€™m
converted
to
sabathierâ€™s
god
should
we
be
sitting
here
talking
like
this
if
it
were
not
so
i
canâ€™t
i
canâ€™t
go
backâ€™
she
rose
and
stood
with
her
hand
pressed
over
her
mouth
watching
him
â€˜wonâ€™t
you
understandâ€™
he
continued
â€˜i
am
an
outcast--a
felon
caught
red-handed
come
in
the
flesh
to
a
hideous
and
righteous
judgment
i
hear
myself
saying
all
these
things
and
yet
grisel
i
do
i
do
love
you
with
all
the
dull
best
i
ever
had
not
now
then
i
donâ€™t
ask
new
even
i
can
i
would
begin
again
god
knows
my
face
has
changed
enough
even
as
it
is
think
of
me
as
that
poor
wandering
ghost
of
yours
how
easily
i
could
hide
away--in
your
memory
and
just
wait
wait
for
you
in
time
even
this
wild
futile
madness
too
would
fade
away
then
i
could
come
back
may
i
tryâ€™
â€˜i
canâ€™t
answer
you
i
canâ€™t
reason

still
i
do
know

off

i
may

wrong

knows
what
they

that
oneâ€™s
to
be
done
and
oneâ€™s
to
be
forsworn
or--forgive
my
friend
the
truest
thing
i
ever
said--or
else
we
lose
the
savour
of
both
oh
then
and
i
know
too
youâ€™d
weary
of
me
i
know
you
monsieur
nicholas
better
than
you
can
ever
know
yourself
though
you
have
risen
from
your
grave
you
follow
a
dream
no
voice
or
face
or
flesh
and
blood
and
not
to
do
what
the
one
old
raven
within
you
cries
you
must
would
be
in
time
to
hate
the
very
sound
of
my
footsteps
you
shall
go
back
poor
turncoat
and
face
the
clearness
the
utterly
more
difficult
bald
and
heartless
clearness
as
together
we
faced
the
dark
life
is
a
little
while
and
though
i
have
no
words
to
tell
what
always
are
and
must
be
foolish
reasons
because
they
are
not
reasons
at
all
but
ghosts
of
memory
i
know
in
my
heart
that
to
face
the
worst
is
your
only
hope
of
peace
should
i
have
staked
so
much
on
your
finding
that
and
now
throw
up
the
game
donâ€™t
let
us
talk
any
more
iâ€™ll
walk
half
the
way
perhaps
perhaps
i
will
walk
all
the
way
i
think
my
brother
guesses--at
least
my
madness
iâ€™ve
talked
and
talked
him
nearly
past
his
patience
and
then
when
you
are
quite
safely
oh
yes
quite
safely
and
soundly
gone
then
i
shall
go
away
for
a
little
so
that
we
canâ€™t
even
hear
each
other
speak
except
in
dreams
life--well
i
always
thought
it
was
much
too
plain
a
tale
to
have
as
dull
an
ending
and
with
us
the
powers
beyond
have
played
a
newer
trick
thatâ€™s
all
another
hour
and
we
will
go
till
then
thereâ€™s
just
the
solitary
walk
home
and
only
the
dull
old
haunted
house
that
hoards
as
many
ghosts
as
we
ourselves
to
watch
our
comingâ€™
evening
began
to
shine
between
the
trees
they
seemed
to
stand
aflame
with
a
melancholy
rapture
in
their
uplifted
boughs
above
their
fading
coats
the
fields
of
the
garnered
harvest
shone
with
a
golden
stillness
awhir
with
shimmering
flocks
of
starlings
and
the
old
birds
that
had
sung
in
the
spring
sang
now
amid
the
same
leaves
grown
older
too
to
give
them
harbourage
herbert
was
sitting
in
his
room
when
they
returned
nursing
his
teacup
on
his
knee
while
he
pretended
to
be
reading
with
elbow
propped
on
the
table
â€˜hereâ€™s
nicholas
sabathier
my
dear
come
to
say
goodbye
awhileâ€™
said
grisel
she
stood
for
a
moment
in
her
white
gown
her
face
turned
towards
the
clear
green
twilight
of
the
open
window
â€˜i
have
promised
to
walk
part
of
the
way
with
him
but
i
think
first
we
must
have
some
tea
no

flatly
refuses
to
be
driven
we
are
going
to
walkâ€™
the
two
friends
were
left
alone
face
to
face
with
a
rather
difficult
silence
only
the
least
degree
of
nervousness
apparent
so
far
as
herbert
was
concerned
in
that
odd
aloof
sustained
air
of
impersonality
that
had
so
baffled
his
companion
in
their
first
queer
talk
together
â€˜your
sister
said
just
now
herbertâ€™
blurted
lawford
at
last
â€˜â€œhereâ€™s
nicholas
sabathier
come
to
say
good-byeâ€
well
i--what
i
want
you
to
understand
is
that
it
is
sabathier
the
worst
he
ever
was
but
also
that
it
is
â€œgood-byeâ€â€™
herbert
slowly
turned
â€˜i
donâ€™t
quite
see
why
â€œgoodbyeâ€
lawford
and--frankly
there
is
nothing
to
explain
we
have
chosen
to
live
such
a
very
out-of-the-way
lifeâ€™
he
went
on
as
if
following
up
a
train
of
thought
â€˜the
truth
is
if
one
wants
to
live
at
all--oneâ€™s
own
life
i
mean--thereâ€™s
no
time
for
many
friends
and
just
steadfastly
regarding
your
neighbourâ€™s
tail
as
you
follow
it
down
into
the
nowhere--itâ€™s
that
that
seems
to
me
the
deadliest
form
of
hypnotism
one
must
simply
go
oneâ€™s
own
way
doing
oneâ€™s
best
to
free
oneâ€™s
mind
of
cant--and
i
dare
say
clearing
some
excellent
stuff
out
with
the
rubbish
one
consequence
is
that
i
donâ€™t
think
however
foolhardy
it
may
be
to
say
so
i
donâ€™t
think
i
care
a
groat
for
any
opinion
as
human
as
my
own
good
or
bad
my
sisterâ€™s
a
million
times
a
better
woman
than
i
am
a
man
what
possibly
could
there
be
then
for
me
to
sayâ€™
he
turned
with
a
nervous
smile
â€˜why
should
it
be
good-byeâ€™
lawford
glanced
involuntarily
towards
the
door
that
stood
in
shadow
duskily
ajar
â€˜wellâ€™
he
said
â€˜we
have
talked
and
we
think
it
must
be
that
until
at
leastâ€™
he
smiled
faintly
â€˜i
can
come
as
quietly
as
your
old
ghost
you
told
me
of
and
in
that
case
it
may
not
be
so
very
long
to
waitâ€™
their
eyes
met
fleetingly
across
the
still
listening
room
â€˜the
more
i
think
of
itâ€™
lawford
pushed
slowly
on
â€˜the
less
i
understand
the
frantic
purposelessness
of
all
that
has
happened
to
me
until
i
went
down
as
you
said
â€œa
godsend
of
a
little
miss
muffetâ€
and
the
inconceivable
farce
came
off
i
was
fairly
happy
fairly
contented
to
dance
my
little
wooden
dance
and
wait
till
the
showman
should
put
me
down
into
his
box
again
and
now--well
here
i
am
the
whole
thing
has
gone
by
and
scarcely
left
a
trace
of
its
visit
here
i
am
for
all
my
friends
to
swear
to
and
yet
herbert
if
youâ€™ll
forgive
me
troubling
you
with
this
stuff
about
myself
not
a
single
belief
or
thought
or
desire
remains
unchanged
you
will
remember
all
that
i
hope
itâ€™s
not
of
course
the
ghost
of
an
apology
only
the
mere
factsâ€™
herbert
rose
and
paced
slowly
across
to
the
window
â€˜the
longer
i
live
lawford
the
more
i
curse
this
futile
gift
of
speech
here
am
i
wanting
to
tell
you
to
say
out
frankly
what
if
mind
could
appeal
direct
to
mind
would
be
merely
as
the
wind
passing
through
the
leaves
of
a
tree
with
just
one--one
multitudinous
rustle
but
which
if
i
tried
to
put
into
words--well
daybreak
would
find
us
still
groping
onâ€™
he
turned
a
peculiar
wry
smile
on
his
face
â€˜itâ€™s
a
dumb
world
but
there
we
are
and
some
day
youâ€™ll
come
againâ€™
â€˜wellâ€™
said
lawford
as
if
with
an
almost
hopeless
effort
to
turn
thought
into
such
primitive
speech
â€˜thatâ€™s
where
we
stand
thenâ€™
he
got
up
suddenly
like
a
man
awakened
in
the
midst
of
unforeseen
danger
â€˜where
is
your
sisterâ€™
he
cried
looking
into
the
shadow
and
as
if
in
actual
answer
to
his
entreaty
they
heard
the
clinking
of
the
cups
on
the
little
old
green
lacquer
tray
she
was
at
that
moment
carrying
into
the
room
she
sat
down
on
the
window
seat
and
put
the
tray
down
beside
her
â€˜it
will
be
before
dark
even
nowâ€™
she
said
glancing
out
at
the
faintly
burning
skies
they
had
trudged
on
together
with
almost
as
deep
a
sense
of
physical
exhaustion
as
peasants
have
who
have
been
labouring
in
the
fields
since
daybreak
and
a
little
beyond
the
village
before
the
last
long
road
began
that
led
in
presently
to
the
housed
and
scrupulous
suburb
she
stopped
with
a
sob
beside
an
old
scarred
milestone
by
the
wayside
â€˜this--is
as
far
as
i
can
goâ€™
she
said
she
stooped
and
laid
her
hand
on
the
cold
moss-grown
surface
of
the
stone
â€˜even
now
itâ€™s
wet
with
dewâ€™
she
rose
again
and
looked
strangely
into
his
face
â€˜yes
yes
here
it
isâ€™
she
said
â€˜oh
and
worse
worse
than
any
fear
but
nothing
now
can
trouble
you
again
of
that
weâ€™re
both
at
least
past
thatâ€™
â€˜griselâ€™
he
said
â€˜forgive
me
but
i
canâ€™t--i
canâ€™t
go
onâ€™
â€˜donâ€™t
think
donâ€™t
thinkâ€™
she
said
taking
his
hands
and
lifting
them
to
her
bosom
â€˜itâ€™s
only
how
the
day
goes
and
it
has
all
my
one
dear
happened
scores
and
scores
of
times
before--mother
and
child
and
friend--and
lovers
that
are
all
these
too
like
us
we
mustnâ€™t
cry
out
perhaps
it
was
all
before
even
we
could
speak--this
sorrow
came
take
all
the
hope
and
all
the
future
and
then
may
come
our
chanceâ€™
â€˜whatâ€™s
life
to
me
now
you
said
the
desire
would
come
back
that
i
should
shake
myself
free
i
could
if
you
would
help
me
i
donâ€™t
know
what
you
are
or
what
your
meaning
is
only
that
i
love
you
care
for
nothing
wish
for
nothing
but
to
see
you
and
think
of
you
a
flat
dull
voice
keeps
saying
that
i
have
no
right
to
be
telling
you
all
this
you
will
know
best
i
know
i
am
nothing
i
ask
nothing
if
we
love
one
another
what
is
there
else
to
sayâ€™
â€˜nothing
nothing
to
say
except
only
good-bye
what
could
you
tell
me
that
i
have
not
told
myself
over
and
over
again
reasonâ€™s
gone
thinkingâ€™s
gone
now
i
am
only
sureâ€™
she
smiled
shadowily
â€˜what
peace
did
he
find
who
couldnâ€™t
perhaps
like
you
face
the
last
good-byeâ€™
they
stood
in
utter
solitude
awhile
in
the
evening
gloom
the
air
was
as
still
and
cold
as
some
grey
unfathomable
untraversed
sea
above
them
uncountable
clouds
drifted
slowly
across
space
â€˜why
do
they
all
keep
whispering
togetherâ€™
he
said
in
a
low
voice
with
cowering
face
â€˜oh
if
you
knew
grisel
how
they
have
hemmed
me
in
how
they
have
come
pressing
in
through
the
narrow
gate
i
left
ajar
only
to
mock
and
mislead
itâ€™s
all
dark
and
unintelligibleâ€™
he
touched
her
hand
peering
out
of
the
shadows
that
seemed
to
him
to
be
gathering
between
their
faces
he
drew
her
closer
and
touched
her
lips
with
his
fingers
her
beauty
seemed
to
his
distorted
senses
to
fill
earth
and
sky
this
then
was
the
presence
the
grave
and
lovely
overshadowing
dream
whose
surrender
made
life
a
torment
and
death
the
near
fold
of
an
immortal
starry
veil
she
broke
from
him
with
a
faint
cry
and
he
found
himself
running
and
running
just
as
he
had
run
that
other
night
with
death
instead
of
life
for
inspiration
towards
his
earthly
home
he
was
utterly
wearied
but
he
walked
on
for
a
long
while
with
a
dogged
unglancing
pertinacity
and
without
looking
behind
him
then
he
rested
under
the
dew-sodden
hedgeside
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
once
indeed
he
did
turn
and
grind
his
way
back
with
hard
uplifted
face
for
many
minutes
but
at
the
meeting
with
an
old
woman
who
in
the
late
dusk
passed
him
unheeded
on
the
road
he
stopped
again
and
after
standing
awhile
looking
down
upon
the
dust
trying
to
gather
up
the
tangled
threads
of
his
thoughts
he
once
more
set
off
homewards
it
was
clear
starry
and
quite
dark
when
he
reached
the
house
the
lamp
at
the
roadside
obscurely
lit
its
breadth
and
height
lamp-light
within
too
was
showing
yellow
between
the
venetian
blinds
a
cold
gas-jet
gleamed
out
of
the
basement
window
he
seemed
bereft
now
of
all
desire
or
emotion
simply
the
passive
witness
of
things
external
in
a
calm
which
though
he
scarcely
realised
its
cause
was
an
exquisite
solace
and
relief
his
senses
were
intensely
sharpened
with
sleeplessness
the
faintest
sound
belled
clear
and
keen
on
his
ear
the
thinnest
beam
of
light
besprinkled
his
eyes
with
curious
brilliance
as
quietly
as
some
nocturnal
creature
he
ascended
the
steps
to
the
porch
and
leaning
between
stone
pilaster
and
wall
listened
intently
for
any
rumour
of
those
within
he
heard
a
clear
rather
languid
and
delicate
voice
quietly
speak
on
until
it
broke
into
a
little
peal
of
laughter
followed
when
it
fell
silent
by
sheilaâ€™s--rapid
rich
and
low
the
first
speaker
seemed
to
be
standing
probably
then
his
evening
visitors
had
only
just
come
in
or
were
preparing
to
depart
he
inserted
his
latchkey
and
gently
pushed
at
the
cumbersome
door
it
was
locked
against
him
with
not
the
faintest
thought
of
resentment
or
surprise
he
turned
back
stooped
over
the
balustrade
and
looked
down
into
the
kitchen
nothing
there
was
visible
but
a
narrow
strip
of
the
white
table
on
which
lay
a
black
cotton
glove
and
beyond
the
glint
of
a
copper
pan
what
made
all
these
mute
and
inanimate
things
so
coldly
hostile
an
extreme
almost
nauseous
distaste
filled
him
at
the
thought
of
knocking
for
admission
of
confronting
ada
possibly
even
sheila
in
the
cold
echoing
gloom
of
the
detestable
porch
of
meeting
the
first
wild
almost
metallic
flash
of
recognition
he
swept
softly
down
again
and
paused
at
the
open
gate
once
before
the
voices
of
the
night
had
called
him
they
would
not
summon
him
forever
in
vain
he
raised
his
eyes
again
towards
the
window
who
were
these
visitors
met
together
to
drum
the
alien
out
he
narrowed
his
lids
and
smiled
up
at
the
vacuous
unfriendly
house
then
wheeling
on
a
sudden
impulse
he
groped
his
way
down
the
gravel
path
that
led
into
the
garden
as
he
had
left
it
the
long
white
window
was
ajar
with
extreme
caution
he
pushed
it
noiselessly
up
and
climbed
in
and
stood
listening
again
in
the
black
passage
on
the
other
side
when
he
had
fully
recovered
his
breath
and
the
knocking
of
his
heart
was
stilled
he
trod
on
softly
till
turning
the
corner
he
came
in
sight
of
the
kitchen
door
it
was
now
narrowly
open
just
enough
perhaps
to
admit
a
cat
and
as
he
softly
approached
looking
steadily
in
he
could
see
ada
sitting
at
the
empty
table
beneath
the
single
whistling
chandelier
in
her
black
dress
and
black
straw
hat
she
was
reading
apparently
but
her
back
was
turned
to
him
and
he
could
not
distinguish
her
arm
beyond
the
elbow
then
almost
in
an
instant
he
discovered
as
drawn
up
and
unstirring
he
gazed
on
that
she
was
not
reading
but
had
covertly
and
instantaneously
raised
her
eyes
from
the
print
on
the
table
beneath
and
was
transfixedly
listening
too
he
turned
his
eyes
away
and
waited
when
again
he
peered
in
she
had
apparently
bent
once
more
over
her
magazine
and
he
stole
on
one
by
one
with
a
thin
remote
exultation
in
his
progress
he
mounted
the
kitchen
stairs
and
with
each
deliberate
and
groping
step
the
voices
above
him
became
more
clearly
audible
at
last
in
the
darkness
of
the
hall
but
faintly
stirred
by
the
gleam
of
lamplight
from
the
chink
of
the
dining-room
door
he
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
drawing-room
door
and
could
hear
with
varying
distinctness
what
those
friendly
voices
were
so
absorbedly
discussing
his
ear
seemed
as
exquisite
as
some
contrivance
of
science
registering
passively
the
least
sound
the
faintest
syllable
and
like
it
in
no
sense
meddling
with
the
thought
that
speech
conveyed
he
simply
stood
listening
fixed
and
motionless
like
some
uncouth
statue
in
the
leafy
hollow
of
a
garden
stony
unspeculating
â€˜oh
but
you
either
refuse
to
believe
bettie
or
you
wonâ€™t
understand
that
itâ€™s
far
worse
than
thatâ€™
sheila
seemed
to
be
upbraiding
or
at
least
reasoning
with
the
last
speaker
â€˜ask
mr
danton--he
actually
saw
himâ€™
â€˜â€œsaw
himâ€â€™
repeated
a
thick
still
voice
â€˜he
stood
there
in
that
very
doorway
mrs
lovat
and
positively
railed
at
me
he
stood
there
and
streamed
out
all
the
names
he
could
lay
his
tongue
to
i
wasnâ€™t--unfriendly
to
the
poor
beggar
when
bethany
let
me
into
it
i
thought
it
was
simply--i
did
indeed
mrs
lawford--a
monstrous
exaggeration
flatly
i
didnâ€™t
believe
it
shall
i
say
that
but
when
i
stood
face
to
face
with
him
i
could
have
taken
my
oath
that
that
was
no
more
poor
old
arthur
lawford
than--well
i
wonâ€™t
repeat
what
particular
word
occurred
to
me
but
thereâ€™
the
corpulent
shrug
was
almost
audible
â€˜we
all
know
what
old
bethany
is
a
sterling
old
chap
mind
you
so
far
as
mere
character
is
concerned
the
right
man
in
the
right
place
but
as
gullible
and
as
soft-hearted
as
a
tom-tit
iâ€™ve
said
all
this
before
i
know
mrs
lawford
and
been
properly
snubbed
for
my
pains
but
if
i
had
been
bethany
iâ€™d
have
sifted
the
whole
story
at
the
beginning
the
moment
he
put
his
foot
into
the
house
look
at
that
tichborne
fellow--went
for
months
and
months
just
picking
up
one
day
what
he
floored
old
hawkins--wasnâ€™t
it--with
the
next
but
of
courseâ€™
he
added
gloomily
â€˜now
thatâ€™s
all
too
late
heâ€™s
moaned
himself
into
a
tolerably
tight
corner
iâ€™d
just
like
to
see
though
a
british
jury
comparing
this
claimant
with
his
photograph
â€˜pon
my
word
i
would
where
would
he
be
then
do
you
thinkâ€™
â€˜but
my
dear
mr
dantonâ€™
went
on
the
clear
languid
voice
lawford
had
heard
break
so
light-heartedly
into
laughter
â€˜you
donâ€™t
mean
to
tell
me
that
a
woman
doesnâ€™t
know
her
own
husband
when
she
sees
him--or
for
the
matter
of
that
when
she
doesnâ€™t
see
him
if
tom
came
home
from
a
ramble
as
handsome
as
apollo
to-morrow
iâ€™d
recognise
him
at
the
very
first
blush--literally
heâ€™d
go
nuzzling
off
to
get
his
slippers
or
complain
that
the
lamps
had
been
smoking
or
hunt
the
house
down
for
last
weekâ€™s
paper
oh
besides
tomâ€™s
tom--and
thereâ€™s
an
end
of
itâ€™
â€˜thatâ€™s
precisely
what
i
think
mrs
lovat
one
is
saturated
with
oneâ€™s
personality
as
it
wereâ€™
â€˜you
see
thatâ€™s
just
it
thatâ€™s
just
exactly
every
womanâ€™s
husband
all
over
he
is
saturated
with
his
personality
bravo
mr
craikâ€™
â€˜good
lordâ€™
said
danton
softly
â€˜i
donâ€™t
deny
itâ€™
â€˜but
thatâ€™
broke
in
sheila
crisply--â€˜thatâ€™s
just
precisely
what
i
asked
you
all
to
come
in
for
itâ€™s
because
i
know
now
apart
altogether
from
the
mere
evidence
that--that
he
is
arthur
mind
i
donâ€™t
say
i
ever
really
doubted
i
was
only
so
utterly
shocked
i
suppose
i
positively
put
posers
to
him
but
his
memory
was
perfect
in
spite
of
the
shock
which
would
have
killed
a--a
more
sensitive
natureâ€™
she
had
risen
it
seemed
and
was
moving
with
all
her
splendid
impressiveness
of
silk
and
presence
across
the
general
line
of
vision
but
the
hall
was
dark
and
still
her
eyes
were
dimmed
with
light
lawford
could
survey
her
there
unmoved
â€˜are
you
there
adaâ€™
she
called
discreetly
â€˜yes
maâ€™amâ€™
answered
the
faint
voice
from
below
â€˜you
have
not
heard
anything--no
knockâ€™
â€˜no
maâ€™am
no
knockâ€™
â€˜the
door
is
open
if
you
should
callâ€™
â€˜yes
maâ€™amâ€™
â€˜the
girlâ€™s
scared
out
of
her
witsâ€™
said
sheila
returning
to
her
audience
â€˜iâ€™ve
told
you
all
that
miserable
ferguson
story--a
piece
of
calm
callous
presence

mind
i
should
never
have
dreamed
my
husband
capable
of
and
the
curious
thing
is--at

it
is
no
longer
curious
in
the
light
of
the
ghastly
facts
i
am
only
waiting
for
mr
bethany
to
tell
you--from
the
very
first

instinctively
detested
the
very
mention

his

mr
craik
with
some
decision
â€˜that
servants
must
have
the
same
wonderful
instinct
as
dogs
and
children
they
are
natural
intuitive
judges
of
characterâ€™
â€˜yesâ€™
said
sheila
gravely
â€˜and
itâ€™s
only
through
that
that
i
got
to
hear
of
the--the
mysterious
friend
in
the
little
pony-carriage
adaâ€™s
magnificently
loyal--i
will
say
thatâ€™
â€˜i
donâ€™t
want
to
suggest
anything
mrs
lawfordâ€™
began
mr
craik
rather
hurriedly
â€˜but
wouldnâ€™t
it
perhaps
be
wiser
not
to
wait
for
mr
bethany
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
for
him
to
be
kept
a
considerable
time
in
the
vestry
after
service
and
to-day
is
the
feast
of
st
michaelâ€™s
and
all
angels
you
know
mightnâ€™t
your
husband
be--er--coming
back
donâ€™t
you
thinkâ€™
â€˜craikâ€™s
right
mrs
lawford
itâ€™s
not
a
bit
of
good
waiting
bethany
would
stick
there
till
midnight
if
any
old
womanâ€™s
spiritual
state
could
keep
her
going
so
long
here
we
all
are
and
at
any
moment
we
may
be
interrupted
mind
you
i
promise
nothing--only
that
there
shall
be
no
scene
but
here
i
am
and
if
he
does
come
knocking
and
ringing
and
lunging
out
in
the
disgusting
manner
he--well
all
i
ask
is
permission
to
speak
for
you
â€˜pon
my
soul
to
think
what
you
must
have
gone
through
it
isnâ€™t
the
place
for
ladies
just
now--honestly
it
ainâ€™tâ€™
â€˜besides
supposing
the
romantic
lady
of
the
pony-carriage
has
friends
are
you
a
pugilist
mr
craikâ€™
â€˜i
hope
i
could
give
some
little
account
of
myself
mrs
lovat
but
you
need
have
no
anxiety
about
thatâ€™
â€˜there
mr
danton
so
as
there
is
not
the
least
cause
for
anxiety
even
if
poor
arthur
should
return
to
his
earthly
home
may
we
share
your
dreadful
story
at
once
sheila
and
then
perhaps
hear
mr
bethanyâ€™s
exposition
of
it
when
he
does
arrive
we
are
amply
guardedâ€™
â€˜honestly
you
know
you
are
a
bit
of
a
sceptic
mrs
lovatâ€™
pleaded
danton
playfully
â€˜iâ€™ve
seen
himâ€™
â€˜and
seeing
is
disbelieving
i
suppose
now
then
sheilaâ€™
â€˜i
donâ€™t
think
thereâ€™s
the
least
chance
of
arthur
returning
to-nightâ€™
said
sheila
solemnly
â€˜i
am
perfectly
well
aware
itâ€™s
best
to
be
as
cheerful
as
one
can--and
as
resolved
but
i
think
bettie
when
even
you
know
the
whole
horrible
secret
you
wonâ€™t
think
mr
danton
was--was
horrified
for
nothing
the
ghastly
the
awful
truth
is
that
my
husband--there
is
no
other
word
for
it--is--possessedâ€™
â€˜â€œpossessedâ€
sheila
what
in
the
name
of
all
the
creeps
is
thatâ€™
â€˜well
i
dare
say
mr
craik
will
explain
it
much
better
than
i
can
by
a
devil
dearâ€™
the
voice
was
perfectly
poised
and
restrained
and
mr
craik
did
not
see
fit
for
the
moment
to
embellish
the
definition
lawford
with
an
almost
wooden
immobility
listened
on
â€˜but
the
devil
or
a
devil
isnâ€™t
there
a
distinctionâ€™
inquired
mrs
lovat
â€˜itâ€™s
in
the
bible
bettie
over
and
over
again
it
was
quite
a
common
thing
in
the
middle
ages
i
think
iâ€™m
right
in
saying
that
am
i
not
mr
craikâ€™
mr
craik
must
have
solemnly
nodded
or
abundantly
looked
his
unwilling
affirmation
â€˜and
what
has
beenâ€™
continued
sheila
temperately
â€˜i
suppose
may
be
againâ€™
â€˜when
the
fellow
began
raving
at
me
the
other
nightâ€™
began
danton
huskily
as
if
out
of
an
unfathomable
pit
of
reflection
â€˜among
other
things
he
said
that
i
havenâ€™t
any
wish
to
remember
was
that
i
was
a
sceptic
and
bethany
said
ditto
to
it
i
donâ€™t
mind
being
called
a
sceptic
why
i
said
myself
mrs
lovat
was
a
sceptic
just
now
but
when
it
comes
to
â€œdevilsâ€
mrs
lawford--i
may
be
convinced
about
the
other
but
â€œdevilsâ€
well
iâ€™ve
been
in
the
city
nearly
twenty-five
years
and
itâ€™s
my
impression
human
nature
can
raise
all
the
devils
we
shall
ever
need
and
another
thingâ€™
he
added
as
if
inspired
and
with
an
immensely
intelligent
blink
â€˜is
it
just
precisely
that
word
in
the
revised
version--eh
craikâ€™
â€˜iâ€™ll
certainly
look
it
up
danton
but
i
take
it
that
mrs
lawford
is
not
so
much
insisting
on
the
word
as
on
the--the
manifestation
and
iâ€™m
bound
to
confess
that
the
society
for
psychical
research
which
has
among
its
members
quite
eminent
and
entirely
trustworthy
men
of
science--i
am
bound
to
admit
they
have
some
very
curious
stories
to
tell
the
old
idea
was
you
know
that
there
are
seventy-two
princely
devils
and
as
many
as
seven
million--er--commoners
it
may
very
well
sound
quaint
to
our
ears
mrs
lovat
but
there
it
is
but
whether
that
has
any
bearing
on--on
what
you
were
saying
danton
i
canâ€™t
say
perhaps
mrs
lawford
will
throw
a
little
more
light
on
the
subject
when
she
tells
us
on
what
precise
facts
her--her
distressing
theory
is
basedâ€™
lawford
had
soundlessly
stolen
a
pace
or
two
nearer
and
by
stooping
forward
a
little
he
could
each
in
turn
scrutinise
the
little
intent
company
sitting
over
his
story
around
the
lamp
at
the
further
end
of
the
table
squatting
like
little
children
with
their
twigs
and
pins
fishing
for
wonders
on
the
brink
of
the
unknown
â€˜yesâ€™
mrs
lovat
was
saying
â€˜i
quite
agree
mr
craik
seventy-two
princes
and
no
princesses
oh
these
masculine
prejudices
but
do
throw
a
little
more
modern
light
on
the
subject
sheilaâ€™
â€˜i
mean
thisâ€™
said
sheila
firmly
â€˜when
i
went
in
for
the
last
time
to
say
good-bye--and
of
course
it
was
at
his
own
wish
that
i
did
leave
him
and
precisely
why
he
wished
it
is
now
unhappily
only
too
apparent--i
had
brought
him
some
money
from
the
bank--fifty
pounds
i
think
yes
fifty
pounds
and
quite
by
the
merest
chance
i
glanced
down
in
passing
at
a
book
he
had
apparently
been
reading
a
book
which
he
seemed
very
anxious
to
conceal
with
his
hand
arthur
is
not
a
great
reader
though
i
believe
he
studied
a
little
before
we
were
married
and--well
i
detest
anything
like
subterfuge
and
i
said
it
out
without
thinking
â€œwhy
youâ€™re
reading
french
arthurâ€
he
turned
deathly
white
but
made
no
answerâ€™
â€˜and
canâ€™t
you
even
confide
to
us
the
title
sheilaâ€™
sighed
mrs
lovat
reproachfully
â€˜wait
a
minuteâ€™
said
sheila
â€˜you
shall
make
as
much
fun
of
the
thing
as
you
like
bettie
when
iâ€™ve
finished
i
donâ€™t
know
why
but
that
peculiar
stealthy
look
haunted
me
â€œwhy
frenchâ€
i
kept
asking
myself
â€œwhy
frenchâ€
arthur
hasnâ€™t
opened
a
french
book
for
years
he
doesnâ€™t
even
approve
of
the
entente
his
argument
was
that
we
ought
to
be
friends
with
the
germans
because
they
are
more
hostile
never
mind
when
ada
came
back
the
next
evening
and
said
he
was
out
i
came
the
following
morning--by
myself--and
knocked
no
one
answered
and
i
let
myself
in
his
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
there
were
candles
and
matches
all
over
the
house--one
even
burnt
nearly
to
the
stick
on
the
floor
in
the
corner
of
the
drawing-room
i
suppose
it
was
foolish
but
i
was
alone
and
just
that
somehow
horrified
me
it
seemed
to
point
to
such
a
peculiar
state
of
mind
i
hesitated
what
was
the
use
of
looking
further
yet
something
seemed
to
say
to
me--and
it
was
surely
providential--â€œgo
downstairsâ€
and
there
in
the
breakfast-room
the
first
thing
i
saw
on
the
table
was
this
book--a
dingy
ragged
bleared
patched-up
oh
a
horrible
a
loathsome
little
book
and
i
have
read
bits
too
here
and
there
and
beside
it
was
my
own
little
school
dictionary
my
own
childâ€™s
â€˜she
looked
up
sharply
â€˜what
was
that
did
anybody
callâ€™
â€˜nobody
i
heardâ€™
said
danton
staring
stonily
round
â€˜it
may
have
been
the
passing
of
the
windâ€™
suggested
mr
craik
after
a
pause
â€˜peep
between
the
blinds
mr
craik
it
may
be
poor
mr
bethany
confronting
pneumonia
in
the
porchâ€™
â€˜thereâ€™s
no
one
there
mrs
lovatâ€™
said
the
curate
returning
softly
from
his
errand
â€˜please
continue
your--your
narrative
mrs
lawfordâ€™
â€˜we
are
panting
for
the
â€œdevilâ€
my
dearâ€™
â€˜well
i
sat
down
and
very
much
against
my
inclination
turned
over
the
pages
it
was
full
of
the
most
revolting
confessions
and
trials
so
far
as
i
could
see
in
fact
i
think
the
book
was
merely
an
amateur
collection
of--of
horrors
and
the
faces
the
portraits
well
then
can
you
imagine
my
feelings
when
towards
the
end
of
the
book
about
thirty
pages
from
the
end
i
came
upon
this--gloating
up
at
me
from
the
table
in
my
house
before
my
very
eyesâ€™
she
cast
a
rapid
glance
over
her
shoulder
and
gathering
up
her
silk
skirt
drew
out
from
the
pocket
beneath
the
few
crumpled
pages
and
passed
them
without
a
word
to
danton
lawford
kept
him
plainly
in
view
as
lowering
his
great
face
he
slowly
stooped
and
holding
the
loose
leaves
with
both
fat
hands
between
his
knees
stared
into
the
portrait
then
he
truculently
lifted
his
cropped
head
â€˜what
did
i
sayâ€™
he
said
â€˜what
did
i
say
what
did
i
tell
old
bethany
in
this
very
room
what
dâ€™ye
think
of
that
mrs
lovat
for
a
portrait
of
arthur
lawford
what
dâ€™ye
make
of
that
craik--eh
devil--ehâ€™
mrs
lovat
glanced
with
arched
eyebrows
and
with
her
finger-tips
handed
the
sheets
on
to
her
neighbour
who
gazed
with
a
settled
and
mournful
frown
and
returned
them
to
sheila
she
took
the
pages
folded
them
and
replaced
them
carefully
in
her
pocket
she
swept
her
hands
over
her
skirts
and
turned
to
danton
â€˜you
agreeâ€™
she
inquired
softly
â€˜itâ€™s
likeâ€™
â€˜like
itâ€™s
the
livinâ€™
livid
image
the
livinâ€™
imageâ€™
he
repeated
stretching
out
his
arm
â€˜as
he
stood
there
that
very
nightâ€™
â€˜what
will
you
say
thenâ€™
said
sheila
quietly
â€˜what
will
you
say
if
i
tell
you
that
that
man
nicholas
de
sabathier
has
been
in
his
grave
for
over
a
hundred
yearsâ€™
dantonâ€™s
little
eyes
seemed
if
anything
to
draw
back
even
further
into
his
head
â€˜iâ€™d
say
mrs
lawford
if
youâ€™ll
excuse
the
word
that
it
might
be
a
damn
horrible
coincidence--iâ€™d
go
farther
an
almost
incredible
coincidence
but
if
you
want
the
sober
truth
iâ€™d
say
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
crafty
clever
abominable
piece
of
trickery
thatâ€™s
what
iâ€™d
say
oh
you
donâ€™t
know
mrs
lovat
when
a
scampâ€™s
a
scamp
heâ€™ll
stop
at
nothing
i
could
tell
you
some
talesâ€™
â€˜ah
but
thatâ€™s
not
allâ€™
said
sheila
eyeing
them
steadfastly
one
by
one
â€˜we
all
of
us
know
that
my
husbandâ€™s
story
was
that
he
had
gone
down
to
widderstone--into
the
churchyard
for
his
convalescent
ramble
that
storyâ€™s
true
we
all
know
that
he
said
he
had
had
a
fit
a
heart
attack
and
that
a
kind
of--of
stupor
had
come
over
him
i
believe
on
my
honour
thatâ€™s
true
too
but
no
one
knows
but
he
himself
and
mr
bethany
and
i
that
it
was
a
wretched
broken
grave
quite
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
that
he
chose
for
his
resting
place
nor--and
i
canâ€™t
get
the
scene
out
of
my
head--nor
that
the
name
on
that
one
solitary
tombstone
down
there
was--wasthisâ€™
danton
rolled
his
eyes
â€˜i
donâ€™t
begin
to
followâ€™
he
said
stubbornly
â€˜you
donâ€™t
meanâ€™
said
mr
craik
who
had
not
removed
his
gaze
from
sheilaâ€™s
face
â€˜i
am
not
to
take
it
that
you
mean

otherâ€™
â€˜yesâ€™
said
sheila
â€˜hisâ€™--she
patted
her
skirts--â€˜sabathierâ€™sâ€™
â€˜you
meanâ€™
said
mrs
lovat
crisply
â€˜that
the
man
in
the
grave
is
the
man
in
the
book

that
the
man
in
the
book
is--is

arthurâ€™s
changed
faceâ€™
sheila
nodded
danton
rose
cumbrously
from
his
chair
looking
beadily
down
on
his
three
friends
â€˜oh
but
you
know
it
isnâ€™t--it
isnâ€™t
rightâ€™
he
began
â€˜lord
i
can
see
him
now
glassy--yes
thatâ€™s
the
very
word
i
said--glassy
it
wonâ€™t
do

on
my
solemn
honour
it
wonâ€™t
do
i
donâ€™t
deny
it
call
it
what
you
like
yes
devils
if
you
like
but
what
i
say
as
a
practical
man
is
that
itâ€™s
just
rank--thatâ€™s
what
it
is
bethanyâ€™s
had
too
much
rope
the
timeâ€™s
gone
by
for
sentiment
and
all
that
foolery
mercyâ€™s
all
very
well
but
after
all
itâ€™s
justice
that
clinches
the
bargain
thereâ€™s
only
one
way
we
must
catch
him
we
must
lay
the
poor
wretch
by
the
heels
before
itâ€™s
too
late
no
publicity
god
bless
me
no
weâ€™d
have
all
the
rags
in
london
on
us
theyâ€™d
pillory
us
nine
days
on
end
weâ€™d
never
live
it
down
no
we
must
just
hush
it
up--a
home
or
something
an
asylum
for
my
partâ€™
he
turned
like
a
huge
toad
his
chin
low
in
his
collar--â€˜and
iâ€™d
say
the
same
if
it
was
my
own
brother
and
after
all
he
is
your
husband
mrs
lawford--iâ€™d
sooner
he
was
in
his
grave
it
takes
two
to
play
at
that
game
thatâ€™s
what
i
say
to
lay
himself
open
i
canâ€™t
stand
it--honestly
i
canâ€™t
stand
it
and
yetâ€™
he
jerked
his
chin
over
the
peak
of
his
collar
towards
the
ladies
â€˜and
yet
you
say
heâ€™s
being
fetched
comes
creeping
home
and
is
fetched
at
dark
by
a--a
lady
in
a
pony-carriage
god
bless
me
itâ€™s
rank
whatâ€™
he
broke
out
violently
again
â€˜what
was
he
doing
there
in
a
cemetery
after
dark
do
you
think
that
beastly
frenchman
would
have
played
such
a
trick
on
craik
here
would
he
have
tried
his
little
game
on
me
deviltry
be
it
if
you
prefer
the
word
and
all
deference
to
you
mrs
lawford
but
i
know
this--a
couple
of
hundred
years
ago
they
would
have
burnt
a
man
at
the
stake
for
less
than
a
tenth
of
this
ask
craik
here
i
donâ€™t
know
how
and
i
donâ€™t
know
when
his
mother
iâ€™ve
always
heard
say
was
a
little
eccentric
but
the
truth
is
heâ€™s
managed
by
some
unholy
legerdemain
to
get
the
thing
at
his
fingerâ€™s
ends
thatâ€™s
what
it
is
think
of
that
unspeakable
book
left
open
on
the
table
look
at
his
ferguson
game
itâ€™s
our
solemn
duty
to
keep
him
for
good
and
all
out
of
mischief
it
reflects
all
round
thereâ€™s
no
getting
out
of
it
weâ€™re
all
in
it
and
tar
sticks
and
then
thereâ€™s
poor
little
alice
to
consider
and--and
you
yourself
mrs
lawford
i
wouldnâ€™t
give
the
fellow--friend
though
he
was
in
a
way--it
isnâ€™t
safe
to
give
him
five
minutesâ€™
freedom
weâ€™ve
simply
got
to
save
you
from
yourself
mrs
lawford
thatâ€™s
what
it
is--and
from
old-fashioned
sentiment
and
i
only
wish
bethany
was
here
now
to
dispute
itâ€™
he
stirred
himself
down
as
it
were
into
his
clothes
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
hearthrug
gently
oscillating
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
but
at
some
faint
rumour
out
of
the
silent
house
his
posture
suddenly
stiffened
and
he
lifted
a
little
with
heavy
steady
lids
his
head
â€˜what
is
the
matter
dantonâ€™
said
mr
craik
in
a
small
voice
â€˜why
are
you
listeningâ€™
â€˜i
wasnâ€™t
listeningâ€™
said
danton
stoutly
â€˜i
was
thinkingâ€™
at
the
same
moment
at
the
creak
of
a
footstep
on
the
kitchen
stairs
lawford
also
had
drawn
soundlessly
back
into
the
darkness
of
the
empty
drawing-room
â€˜while
mr
danton
is
â€œthinkingâ€
sheilaâ€™
mrs
lovat
was
softly
interposing
â€˜do
please
listen
a
moment
to
me
do
you
mean
really
that
that
frenchman--the
one
youâ€™ve
pocketed--is
the
poor
creature
in
the
graveâ€™
â€˜yes
mrs
lawfordâ€™
said
mr
craik
putting
out
his
face
a
little
â€˜are
we
to
take
it
that
you
mean
thatâ€™
â€˜itâ€™s
the
same
date
dear
the
same
name
even
to
the
spelling
what
possibly
else
can
i
thinkâ€™
â€˜and
that
the
poor
creature
in
the
grave
actually
climbed
up
out
of
the
darkness
and--well
whatâ€™
â€˜i
know
no
more
than
you
do
now
bettie
but
the
two
faces--you
must
remember
you
havenâ€™t
seen
my
husband
sinceâ€™
you
must
remember
you
havenâ€™t
heard
the
peculiar--the
most
peculiar
things
he--arthur
himself--has
said
to
me
things
such
as
a
wife
and
not
in
jest
bettie
i
assure
youâ€™
â€˜and
mr
bethanyâ€™
interpolated
mr
craik
modestly
feeling
his
way
â€˜pah
bethany
craik
heâ€™d
back
old
nick
himself
if
he
came
with
a
good
tale
weâ€™ve
got
to
act
weâ€™ve
got
to
settle
his
hash
before
he
does
any
mischiefâ€™
â€˜wellâ€™
began
mrs
lovat
smiling
a
little
remorsefully
beneath
the
arch
of
her
raised
eyebrows
â€˜i
sincerely
hope
youâ€™ll
all
forgive
me
but
i
really
am
heart
and
soul
with
old
nick
as
mr
danton
seems
on
intimate
terms
enough
to
call
him
dead
he
is
really
immensely
alluring
and
alive
i
think
awfully--just
awfully
pitiful
and--and
pathetic
but
if
i
know
anything
of
arthur
he
wonâ€™t
be
beaten
by
a
frenchman
as
for
just
the
portrait
i
think
do
you
know
i
almost
prefer
dark
menâ€™--she
glanced
up
at
the
face
immediately
in
front
of
the
clock--â€˜at
leastâ€™
she
added
softly
â€˜when
they
are
not
looking
very
vindictive
i
suppose
people
are
fairly
often
possessed
mr
craik
how
many
â€œdeadly
sinsâ€
are
thereâ€™
â€˜as
a
matter
of
fact
mrs
lovat
there
are
seven
but
i
think
in
this
case
mrs
lawford
intends
to
suggest
not
so
much
that--that
her
husband
is
in
that
condition
habitual
sin
you
know--grave
enough
of
course
i
own--but
that
he
is
actually
being
compelled
even
to
the
extent
of
a
more
or
less
complete
change
of
physiognomy
to
follow
the
biddings
of
some
atrocious
spiritual
influence
it
is
no
breach
of
confidence
to
say
that
i
have
myself
been
present
at
a
death-bed
where
the
struggle
against
what
i
may
call
the
end
was
perfectly
awful
to
witness
i
donâ€™t
profess
to
follow
all
the
ramifications
of
the
affair
but
though
possibly
mr
danton
may
seem
a
little
harsh
such
harshness
if
i
may
venture
to
intercede
is
not
necessarily
â€œvindictiveâ€
and--and
personal
security
is
a
considerationâ€™
â€˜if
you
only
knew
the
awful
fear
the
awful
uncertainty
i
have
been
in
bettie
oh
it
is
worse
infinitely
worse
than
you
can
possibly
imagine
i
have
myself
heard
the
voice
speak
out
of
him--a
high
hard
nasal
voice
iâ€™ve
seen
what
mr
danton
calls
the
â€œglassinessâ€
come
into
his
face
and
an
expression
so
wild
and
so
appallingly
depraved
as
it
were
that
i
have
had
to
hurry
downstairs
to
hide
myself
from
the
thought
iâ€™m
willing
to
sacrifice
everything
for
my
own
husband
and
for
alice
but
can
it
be
expected
of
me
to
go
on
harbouringâ€™
lawford
listened
on
in
vain
for
a
moment
poor
sheila
it
seemed
had
all
but
broken
down
â€˜look
here
mrs
lawfordâ€™
began
danton
huskily
â€˜you
really
mustnâ€™t
give
way
you
really
mustnâ€™t
itâ€™s
awful
unspeakably
awful
i
admit
but
here
we
are
friends
in
the
midst
of
friends
and
thereâ€™s
absolutely
nothing--whatâ€™s
that

who
is
it
oh
the
maidâ€™
ada
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
in
â€˜all
iâ€™ve
come
to
ask

said
in
a
low
voice
â€˜is

aware

somebody
in

out
the
husky
voice
again
â€˜control

gently

thatâ€™
â€˜begging
your
pardon
sir

perfectly
under

all
i

is
that

downstairs

thereâ€™s
somebody
in

houseâ€™
a
concentrated
hush
seemed
to
have
fallen
on
the
little
assembly
â€˜â€œsomebodyâ€--but
whoâ€™
said
sheila
out
of
the
silence
â€˜you
come
up
here

with
these
idle

â€˜no

here
that

heâ€™s
been
here
ever
since
he
was
here

i
came
on

and
he
was
here
last
night
and
heâ€™s
here
now
i
canâ€™t
be
deceived
by
my
own
feelings
itâ€™s
not
right
itâ€™s
not
out-spoken
to
keep
me
in
the
dark
like
this
and
if
you
have
no
objection
i
would
like
to
go
homeâ€™
lawford
in
his
utter
weariness
had
nearly
closed
the
door
and
now
sat
bent
up
on
a
chair
wondering
vaguely
when
this
poor
play
was
coming
to
an
end
longing
with
an
intensity
almost
beyond
endurance
for
the
keen
night
air
the
open
sky
but
still
his
ears
drank
in
every
tiniest
sound
or
stir
he
heard
dantonâ€™s
lowered
voice
muttering
his
arguments
he
heard
ada
quietly
sniffing
in
the
darkness
of
the
hall
and
this
was
his
world
this
was
his
lifeâ€™s
panorama
creaking
on
at
every
jolt
this
was
the
â€˜mustâ€™
grisel
had
sent
him
back
to--these
poor
fools
packed
together
in
a
panic
at
an
old
stale
tale
well
they
would
all
come
out
presently
and
cluster
and
the
crested
cackling
fellow
would
lead
them
safely
away
out
of
the
haunted
farmyard
he
started
out
of
his
reverie
at
dantonâ€™s
voice
close
at
hand
â€˜look
here
my
good
girl
we
havenâ€™t
the
least
intention
of
keeping
you
in
the
dark
if
you
want
to
leave
your
mistress
like
this
in
the
midst
of
her
anxieties
she
says
you
can
go
and
welcome
but
itâ€™s
not
a
bit
of
good
in
the
world
coming
up
with
these
cock-and-bull
stories
the
truth
is
your
masterâ€™s
mad
thatâ€™s
the
sober
truth
of
it--hopelessly
insane
you
understand
and
weâ€™ve
got
to
find
him
but
nothingâ€™s
to
be
said
dâ€™ye
see
itâ€™s
got
to
be
done
without
fuss
or
scandal
but
if
thereâ€™s
any
witness
wanted
or
anything
of
that
kind
why
here
you
are
andâ€™
he
dropped
his
voice
to
an
almost
inaudible
hoot
â€˜and
well
worth
your
while
you
did
see
him
eh
step
into
the
trap
and
all
thatâ€™
ada
stood
silent
a
moment
â€˜i
donâ€™t
know
sirâ€™
she
began
quietly
â€˜by
what
right
you
speak
to
me
about
what
you
call
my
cock-and-bull
stories
if
the
master
is
mad
all
i
can
say
to
anybody
is
iâ€™m
very
sorry
to
hear
it
i
came
to
my
mistress
sir
if
you
please
and
i
prefer
to
take
my
orders
from
one
who
has
a
right
to
give
them
did
i
understand
you
to
say
maâ€™am
that
you
wouldnâ€™t
want
me
any
more
this
eveningâ€™
sheila
had
swept
solemnly
to
the
door
â€˜mr
danton
meant
all
that
he
said
quite
kindly
ada
i
can
perfectly
understand
your
feelings--perfectly
and
iâ€™m
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
all
your
kindness
to
me
in
very
trying
circumstances
we
are
all
agreed--we
are
forced
to
the
terrible
conclusion
which--which
mr
danton
has
just--expressed
and
i
know
i
can
rely
on
your
discretion
donâ€™t
stay
on
a
moment
if
you
really
are
afraid
but
when
you
say
â€œsome
oneâ€
ada
do
you
mean--some
one
like
you
or
me
or
do
you
mean--the
otherâ€™
â€˜iâ€™ve
been
sitting
in
the
kitchen
maâ€™am
unable
to
move
iâ€™m
watched
everywhere
the
other
evening
i
went
into
the
drawing-room--i
was
alone
in
the
house--and
i
canâ€™t
describe
it
it
wasnâ€™t
dark
and
yet
it
was
all
still
and
black
like
the
ruins
after
a
fire
i
donâ€™t
mean
i
saw
it
only
that
it
was
like
a
scene
and
then
the
watching--i
am
quite
aware
to
some
it
may
sound
all
fancy
but
iâ€™m
not
superstitious
never
was
i
only
mean--that
i
canâ€™t
sit
alone
here
i
darenâ€™t
else
iâ€™m
quite
myself
so
if
so
be
you
donâ€™t
want
me
any
more
if
i
canâ€™t
be
of
any
further
use
to
you
or
to--to
mr
lawford
iâ€™d
prefer
to
go
homeâ€™
â€˜very
well
ada
thank
you
you
can
go
out
this
wayâ€™
the
door
was
unchained
and
unbolted
and
â€˜good-nightâ€™
said
and
sheila
swept
back
in
sombre
pomp
to
her
absorbed
friends
â€˜sheâ€™s
quite
a
good
creature
at
heartâ€™
she
explained
frankly
as
if
to
disclaim
any
finesse
â€˜and
almost
quixotically
loyal
but
what
really
did
she
mean
do
you
think
she
is
so
obstinate
that
maddening
â€œsome
oneâ€
how
they
do
repeat
themselves
it
canâ€™t
be
my
husband
not
dr
ferguson
i
mean
you
donâ€™t
suppose--oh
surely
not
â€œsome
oneâ€
elseâ€™
again
the
dark
silence
of
the
house
seemed
to
drift
in
on
the
little
company
mr
craik
cleared
his
throat
â€˜i
failed
to
catch
quite
all
that
the
maid
saidâ€™
he
murmured
apologetically
â€˜but
i
certainly
did
gather
it
was
to
some
kind
of--of
emanation
she
was
referring
and
the
â€œruinâ€
you
know
iâ€™m
not
a
mystic
and
yet
do
you
know
that
somehow
seemed
to
me
almost
offensively
suggestive
of--of
demonic
influence
you
donâ€™t
suppose
mrs
lawford--and
of
course
i
wouldnâ€™t
for
a
moment
venture
on
such
a
conjecture
unsupported-but
even
if
this
restless
spirit
let
us
call
it
did
succeed
in
making
a
footing
it
might
possibly
be
rather
in
the
nature
of
a
lodging
than
a
permanent
residence
moreover
we
are
i
think
bound
to
remember
that
probably
in
all
spheres
of
existence
like
attracts
like
even
the
gadarene
episode
seems
to
suggest
a
possible
multiplicationâ€™
he
peered
largely
â€˜you
donâ€™t
suppose
mrs
lawfordâ€™
â€˜i
think
mr
craik
doesnâ€™t
quite
relish
having
to
break
the
news
sheila
dearâ€™
explained
mrs
lovat
soothingly
â€˜that
perhaps
sabathierâ€™s
out
which
really
is
quite
a
heavenly
suggestion
for
in
that
case
your
husband
would
be
in
wouldnâ€™t
he
just
our
old
stolid
arthur
again
you
know
and
next
mr
craik
is
suggesting
and
it
certainly
does
seem
rather
fascinating
that
poor
adaâ€™s
got
mixed
up
with
the
frenchmanâ€™s
friends
or
perhaps
even
with
one
of
the
seventy-two
princes
royal
i
know
women
canâ€™t
or
mustnâ€™t
reason
mr
danton
but
you
do
i
hope
just
catch
the
driftâ€™
danton
started
â€˜i
wasnâ€™t
really
listening
to
the
girlâ€™
he
explained
nonchalantly
shrugging
his
black
shoulders
and
pursing
up
his
eyes
â€˜personally
mrs
lovat
iâ€™d
pack
the
baggage
off
to-night
box
and
all
but
itâ€™s
not
my
businessâ€™
â€˜you
mustnâ€™t
be
depressed--must
he
mr
craik
after
all
my
dear
man
the
business
as
you
call
it
is
not
exactly
entailed
but
really
sheila
i
think
it
must
be
getting
very
late
mr
bethany
wonâ€™t
come
now
and
the
dear
old
thing
ought
certainly
to
have
his
say
before
we
go
any
further
oughtnâ€™t
he
mr
danton
so
whatâ€™s
the
use
of
worriting
poor
adaâ€™s
ghost
any
longer
and
as
for
poor
arthur--i
havenâ€™t
the
faintest
desire
in
the
world
to
hear
the
little
cart
drive
up
simply
in
case
it
should
be
to
leave
your
unfortunate
husband
behind
it
sheila
what
it
must
be
to
be
alone
all
night
in
this
house
with
a
dead
and
buried
frenchmanâ€™s
face--well
i
shudder
dearâ€™
â€˜and
yet
mrs
lovatâ€™
said
mr
craik
with
some
little
show
of
returning
bravado
â€˜as
we
make
our
bed
you
knowâ€™
â€˜but
in
this
case
you
seeâ€™
she
replied
reflectively
â€˜if
all
accounts
are
true
mr
craik
itâ€™s
manifestly
the
wicked
frenchman
who
has
made
the
bed
and
sheila
who
refu----
but
look
mr
danton
is
fretting
to
get
homeâ€™
â€˜if
youâ€™ll
all
go
to
the
doorâ€™
said
danton
seizing
a
fleeting
opportunity
to
raise
his
eyebrows
more
expressively
even
than
if
he
had
again
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
sheila
â€˜iâ€™ll
put
out
the
lightâ€™
the
night
air
flowed
into
the
dark
house
as
danton
hastily
groped
his
way
out
of
the
dining-room
â€˜thereâ€™s
only
one
thingâ€™
said
sheila
slowly
â€˜when
i
last
saw
my
husband
you
know
he
was
i
think
the
least
bit
better
he
was
always
stubbornly
convinced
it
would
all
come
right
in
time
thatâ€™s
why
i
think
heâ€™s
been
spending
his--his
evenings
away
from
home
but
supposing
it
didâ€™
â€˜for
my
partâ€™
said
mrs
lovat
breathing
the
faint
wind
that
was
rising
out
of
the
west
â€˜iâ€™d
sigh
iâ€™d
rub
my
eyes
iâ€™d
thank
god
for
such
an
exciting
dream
and
iâ€™d
turn
comfortably
over
and
go
to
sleep
again
iâ€™m
all
for
arthur--absolutely--back
against
the
wallâ€™
â€˜for
my
partâ€™
said
danton
looming
in
the
dusk
â€˜friend
or
no
friend
iâ€™d
cut
the--iâ€™d
cut
him
dead
but
donâ€™t
fret
mrs
lawford
devil
or
no
devil
heâ€™s
gone
for
goodâ€™
â€˜and
for
my
part--â€™
began
mr
craik
but
the
door
at
that
moment
slammed
voices
however
broke
out
almost
immediately
in
the
porch
and
after
a
hurried
consultation
lawford
in
his
stagnant
retreat
heard
the
door
softly
reopen
and
the
striking
of
a
match
and
mr
craik
followed
closely
by
dantonâ€™s
great
body
stole
circumspectly
across
his
dim
chink
and
the
first
adventurer
went
stumbling
down
the
kitchen
staircase
â€˜i
supposeâ€™
muttered
lawford
turning
his
head
in
the
darkness
â€˜they
have
come
back
to
put
out
the
kitchen
gasâ€™
danton
began
a
busy
tuneless
whistle
between
his
teeth
â€˜coming
craikâ€™
he
called
thickly
after
a
long
pause
apparently
no
answer
had
been
returned
to
his
inquiry
he
waited
a
little
longer
with
legs
apart
and
eyeballs
enveloped
in
brooding
darkness
â€˜iâ€™ll
just
go
and
tell
the
ladies
youâ€™re
comingâ€™
he
suddenly
bawled
down
the
hollow
â€˜do
you
hear
craik
theyâ€™re
alone
you
knowâ€™
and
with
that
he
resolutely
wheeled
and
rapidly
made
his
way
down
the
steps
into
the
garden
some
few
moments
afterwards
mr
craik
shook
himself
free
of
the
basement
hastened
at
a
spirited
trot
to
rejoin
his
companions
and
in
his
absence
of
mind
omitted
to
shut
the
front
door
lawford
sat
on
in
the
darkness
and
now
one
sentence
and
now
another
of
their
talk
would
repeat
itself
in
his
memory
in
much
the
same
way
as
one
listlessly
turns
over
an
antiquated
diary
to
read
here
and
there
a
flattened
and
almost
meaningless
sentiment
sometimes
a
footstep
passed
echoing
along
the
path
under
the
trees
then
his
thoughts
would
leave
him
and
he
would
listen
and
listen
till
it
had
died
quite
out
it
was
all
so
very
far
away
and
they
too--these
talkers--so
very
far
away
as
remote
and
yet
as
clear
as
the
characters
in
a
play
when
they
have
made
their
final
bow
and
have
left
the
curtained
stage
and
one
is
standing
uncompanioned
and
nearly
the
last
of
the
spectators
and
the
lights
that
have
summoned
back
reality
again
are
being
extinguished
it
was
only
by
painful
effort
of
mind
that
he
kept
recalling
himself
to
himself--why
he
was
here
what
it
all
meant
that
this
was
indeed
actuality
yet
after
all
this
by
now
was
his
customary
loneliness
there
was
little
else
he
desired
for
the
present
than
the
hospitality
of
the
dark
he
glanced
around
him
in
the
clear
black
stirless
air
here
and
there
it
seemed
a
humped
or
spindled
form
held
against
all
comers
its
passive
place
here
and
there
a
tiny
faintness
of
light
played
night
after
night
these
chairs
and
tables
kept
their
blank
vigil
why
he
thought
pleased
as
an
overtired
child
with
the
fancy
in
a
sense
they
were
always
alone
shut
up
in
a
kind
of
senselessness--just
like
us
all
but
what--what
he
had
suddenly
risen
from
his
chair
to
ask
himself--what
on
earth
are
they
alone
with
no
precise
answer
had
been
forthcoming
to
that
question
but
as
in
turning
in
the
doorway
he
looked
out
into
the
night
flashing
here
and
there
in
dark
spaces
of
the
sky
above
the
withering
apple
leaves--the
long
dark
wall
and
quiet
untrodden
road--with
the
tumultuous
beating
of
the
stars--one
thing
at
least
he
was
conscious
of
having
learned
in
these
last
few
days
he
knew
what
kind
of
a
place
he
was
alone
in
it
seemed
to
weave
a
spell
over
him
to
call
up
a
nostalgia
he
had
lost
all
remembrance
of
since
childhood
and
that
queer
homesickness
at
any
rate
was
all
sabathierâ€™s
doing
he
thought
smiling
in
his
rather
careworn
fashion
sabathier
it
was
this
mystery
bereft
now
of
all
fear
and
this
beauty
together
that
made
life
the
endless
changing
and
yet
changeless
thing
it
was
and
yet
mystery
and
loveliness
alike
were
only
really
appreciable
with
oneâ€™s
legs
as
it
were
dangling
down
over
into
the
grave
just
with
oneâ€™s
lantern
lit
on
the
edge
of
the
whispering
unknown
and
a
reiterated
going
back
out
of
the
solitude
into
the
light
and
warmth
to
the
voices
and
glancing
of
eyes
to
say
good-bye--that
after
all
was
this
life
on
earth
for
those
who
watched
as
well
as
acted
what
if
oneâ€™s
earthly
home
were
empty--still
the
restless
fretted
traveller
must
tarry
â€˜for
the
horrible
worst
of
it
is
my
friendâ€™
he
said
as
if
to
some
silent
companion
listening
behind
him
â€˜the
worst
of
it
is
your
way
was
just
simply
solely
suicideâ€™
what
was
it
herbert
had
called
it
yes
a
cul-de-sac--black
lofty
immensely
still
and
old
and
picturesque
but
none
the
less
merely
a
contemptible
cul-de-sac
no
abiding
place
scarcely
even
sufficing
with
its
flagstones
for
a
groan
from
the
fugitive
and
deluded
refugee
there
was
no
peace
for
the
wicked
the
question
of
course
then
came
in--was
there
any
peace
anywhere
for
anybody
he
smiled
at
a
sudden
odd
remembrance
of
a
quiet
sardonic
old
aunt
whom
he
used
to
stay
with
as
a
child
â€˜children
should
be
seen
and
not
heardâ€™
she
would
say
peering
at
him
over
his
favourite
pudding
his
eyes
rested
vacantly
on
the
darkling
street
he
fell
again
into
reverie
gigantically
brooded
over
by
shapes
only
imagination
dimly
conceived
of
the
remote
alleys
of
his
mind
astir
with
a
shadowy
and
ceaseless
traffic
which
it
wasnâ€™t
at
least
this
lifeâ€™s
business
to
hearken
after
or
regard
and
as
he
stood
there
in
a
mysteriously
thronging
peaceful
solitude
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
faintly
out
of
the
silence
broke
the
sound
of
approaching
hoofs
his
heart
seemed
to
gather
itself
close
a
momentary
blindness
veiled
his
eyes
so
wildly
had
his
blood
surged
up
into
cheek
and
brain
he
remained
caught
up
with
head
slightly
inclined
listening
as
with
an
interminable
tardiness
measureless
anguished
hope
died
down
into
nothing
in
his
mind
cold
and
heavy
his
heart
began
to
beat
again
as
if
to
catch
up
those
laggard
moments
he
turned
with
an
infinite
revulsion
of
feeling
to
look
out
on
the
lamps
of
the
old
fly
that
had
drawn
up
at
his
gate
he
watched
incuriously
a
little
old
lady
rather
arduously
alight
pause
and
look
up
at
his
darkened
windows
and
after
a
momentary
hesitation
and
a
word
over
her
shoulder
to
the
cabman
stoop
and
fumble
at
the
iron
latch
he
watched
her
with
a
kind
of
wondering
aversion
still
scarcely
tinged
with
curiosity
she
had
succeeded
in
lifting
the
latch
and
in
pushing
her
way
through
and
was
even
now
steadily
advancing
towards
him
along
the
tiled
path
and
a
minute
after
he
recognised
with
the
strangest
reactions
the
quiet
old
figure
that
had
shared
a
sunset
with
him
ages
and
ages
ago--his
motherâ€™s
old
schoolfellow
miss
sinnet
he
was
already
ransacking
the
still
faintly-perfumed
dining-room
for
matches
and
had
just
succeeded
in
relighting
the
still-warm
lamp
when
he
heard
her
quiet
step
in
the
porch
even
felt
her
peering
in
in
the
gloom
with
all
her
yearsâ€™
trickling
customariness
behind
her
a
little
dubious
of
knocking
on
a
wide-open
door
but
the
lamp
lit
lawford
went
out
again
and
welcomed
his
visitor
â€˜i
am
aloneâ€™
he
was
explaining
gravely
â€˜my
wifeâ€™s
away
and
the
whole
house
topsy-turvy
how
very
very
kind
of
youâ€™
the
old
lady
was
breathing
a
little
heavily
after
her
ascent
of
the
steep
steps
and
seemed
not
to
have
noticed
his
outstretched
hand
none
the
less
she
followed
him
in
and
when
she
was
well
advanced
into
the
lighted
room
she
sighed
deeply
raised
her
veil
over
the
front
of
her
bonnet
and
leisurely
took
out
her
spectacles
â€˜i
supposeâ€™
she
was
explaining
in
a
little
quiet
voice
â€˜you
are
mr
arthur
lawford
but
as
i
did
not
catch
sight
of
a
light
in
any
of
the
windows
i
began
to
fear
that
the
cabman
might
have
set
me
down
at
the
wrong
houseâ€™
she
raised
her
head
and
first
through
and
then
over
her
spectacles
she
deliberately
and
steadfastly
regarded
him
â€˜yesâ€™
she
said
to
herself
and
turned
not
as
it
seemed
entirely
with
satisfaction
to
look
for
a
chair
he
wheeled
the
most
comfortable
up
to
the
table
â€˜i
have
been
visiting
my
old
friend
miss
tucker--rev
w
tuckerâ€™s
daughter--she
i
knew
could
give
me
your
address
and
sure
enough
she
did
your
road
dâ€™ye
see
was
on
my
way
home
and
i
determined
in
spite
of
the
hour
just
to
inquire
you
must
understand
mr
lawford
there
was
something
that
i
rather
particularly
wanted
to
say
to
you
but
there--youâ€™re
looking
sadly
sadly
ill
andâ€™
she
glanced
round
a
little
inquisitively
â€˜i
think
my
story
had
better
wait
for
a
more
convenient
occasionâ€™
â€˜not
at
all
miss
sinnet
please
notâ€™
lawford
assured
her
â€˜really
i
have
been
ill
but
iâ€™m
now
practically
quite
myself
again
my
wife
and
daughter
have
gone
away
for
a
few
days
and
i
follow
to-morrow
so
if
youâ€™ll
forgive
such
a
very
poor
welcome
it
may
be
my--my
only
chance
do
please
let
me
hearâ€™
the
old
lady
leant
back
in
her
chair
placed
her
hands
on
its
arms
and
softly
panted
while
out
of
the
rather
broad
serenity
of
her
face
she
sat
blinking
up
at
her
companion
as
if
after
a
long
talk
instead
of
at
the
beginning
of
one
â€˜noâ€™
she
repeated
reflectively
â€˜i
donâ€™t
like
your
looks
at
all
yet
here
we
are
enjoying
beautiful
autumn
weather
mr
lawford
why
not
make
use
of
itâ€™
â€˜oh
yesâ€™
said
lawford
â€˜i
do
i
have
been
making
tremendous
use
of
itâ€™
her
eyelid
flickered
at
his
candid
glance
â€˜and
does
your
business
permit
of
much
walkingâ€™
â€˜well
iâ€™ve
been
malingering
these
last
few
days
idling
at
home
but
i
am
usually
more
or
less
my
own
man
miss
sinnet
i
walk
a
littleâ€™
â€˜hâ€™m
but
not
much
in
my
direction
mr
lawfordâ€™
she
quizzed
him
â€˜all
horrible
indolence
miss
sinnet
but
i
often--often
think
of
you
and
especially
just
latelyâ€™
â€˜well
nowâ€™
she
wriggled
round
her
head
to
get
a
better
view
of
him
rather
stiffly
seated
on
his
chair
â€˜thatâ€™s
very
peculiar
because
i
too
have
been
thinking
lately
a
great
deal
of
you
and
yet--i
fancy
i
shall
succeed
in
mystifying
you
presently--not
precisely
of
you
but
of
somebody
elseâ€™
â€˜you
do
mystify
me--â€œsomebody
elseâ€â€™
he
replied
gallantly
â€˜and
that
is
the
story
i
supposeâ€™
â€˜thatâ€™s
the
storyâ€™
repeated
miss
sinnet
with
some
little
triumph
â€˜now
let
me
see
it
was
on
saturday
last--yes
saturday
evening
a
wonderful
sunset
bewley
heathâ€™
â€˜oh
yes
my
daughterâ€™s
favourite
walkâ€™
â€˜and
your
daughterâ€™s
age
nowâ€™
â€˜sheâ€™s
nearly
sixteen
alice
you
knowâ€™
â€˜ah
yes
alice
to
be
sure
it
is
a
beautiful
walk
and
if
fine
i
generally
take
mine
there
too
itâ€™s
near
thereâ€™s
shade
itâ€™s
very
little
frequented
and
i
can
wander
and
muse
undisturbed
and
that
i
think
is
pretty
well
all
that
an
old
woman
like
me
is
fit
for
mr
lawford
â€œnearly
sixteenâ€
is
it
possible
dear
dear
me
but
let
me
get
on
on
my
way
home
from
the
heath
you
may
be
aware
before
one
reaches
the
road
again
thereâ€™s
a
somewhat
steep
ascent
i
havenâ€™t
the
strength
i
had
and
whether
iâ€™m
fatigued
or
not
i
have
always
made
it
a
rule
to
rest
awhile
on
a
most
convenient
little
seat
at
the
summit
admire
the
view--what
i
can
see
of
it--and
then
make
my
way
quietly
quietly
home
on
saturday
however
and
it
most
rarely
occurs--once
i
remember
when
a
very
civil
nursemaid
was
sitting
with
two
charmingly
behaved
little
children
in
the
sunshine
and
i
heard
they
were
my
old
friend
major
loderâ€™s
sonâ€™s
children--on
saturday
as
i
was
saying
my
own
particular
little
haunt
was
already
occupiedâ€™
she
glanced
back
at
him
from
out
of
her
thoughts
as
it
were
â€˜by
a
gentleman
i
say
gentleman
though
i
must
confess
that
his
conduct--perhaps
too
a
little
something
even
in
his
appearance
somewhat
belied
the
term
anyhow
gentleman
let
us
call
himâ€™
lawford
all
attention
nodded
and
encouragingly
smiled
â€˜iâ€™m
not
one
of
those
tiresome
suspicious
people
mr
lawford
who
distrust
strangers
i
have
never
been
molested
and
i
have
enjoyed
many
and
many
a
most
interesting
and
sometimes
instructive
talk
with
an
individual
whom
iâ€™ve
never
seen
in
my
life
before
and
this
side
of
the
grave
perhaps
am
never
likely
to
see
againâ€™
she
lifted
her
head
with
pursed
lips
and
gravely
yet
still
flickeringly
regarded
him
once
more
â€˜well
i
made
some
trifling
remark--the
weather
the
view
what-notâ€™
she
explained
with
a
little
jerk
of
her
shoulder--â€˜and
to
my
extreme
astonishment
he
turned
and
addressed
me
by
name--miss
sinnet
unmistakably--sinnet
now
perhaps
and
very
rightly
you
wonâ€™t
considered
that
a
very
peculiar
thing
to
do
but
you
will
recollect
mr
lawford
that
i
had
been
sitting
there
a
considerable
time
surely
now
if
you
had
recognised
my
face
you
would
have
addressed
me
at
onceâ€™
â€˜was
he
do
you
think
miss
sinnet
a
little
uncertain
perhapsâ€™
â€˜never
mind
never
mind
let
me
get
on
with
my
story
first
the
next
thing
my
gentleman
does
is
more
mysterious
still
his
whole
manner
was
a
little
peculiar
perhaps--a
certain
restlessness
what
in
fact
one
might
be
almost
tempted
to
call
a
certain
furtiveness
of
behaviour
never
mind
what
he
does
next
is
to
ask
me
a
riddle
perhaps
you
wonâ€™t
think
that
was
peculiar
eitherâ€™
â€˜what
was
the
riddleâ€™
smiled
lawford
â€˜why
to
be
sure
to
guess
his
name
simply
guided
so
i
surmised
by
some
very
faint
resemblance
in
his
face
to
his
mother
who
was
he
assured
me
an
old
schoolfellow
of
mine
at
brighton
i
thought
and
thought
i
confess
the
adventure
was
beginning
to
be
a
little
perplexing
but
of
course
very
very
few
of
my
old
schoolfellows
remain
distinctly
in
my
memory
now
and
i
fear
that
grows
more
treacherous
the
longer
i
live
their
faces
as
girls
are
clear
enough
but
later
in
life
most
of
them
drifted
out
of
sight--many
alas
are
dead
and
well
at
last
i
narrowed
my
man
down
to
one
and
who
now
do
you
suppose
that
wasâ€™
lawford
sustained
an
expression
of
abysmal
mystification
â€˜do
tell
me--whoâ€™
â€˜your
own
poor
dear
mother
mr
lawfordâ€™
â€˜he
said
soâ€™
â€˜no
noâ€™
said
the
old
lady
with
some
vexation
closing
her
eyes
â€˜i
said
so
he
asked
me
to
guess
and
i
guessed
mary
lawford
now
do
you
seeâ€™
yes
yes
but
was
he
like
her
miss
sinnet
that
was
really
very
very
extraordinary
did
you
see
any
likeness
in
his
faceâ€™
miss
sinnet
very
deliberately
took
her
spectacles
out
of
their
case
again
â€˜now
see
here
sir
this
is
being
practical
isnâ€™t
it
iâ€™m
just
going
to
take
a
leisurely
glance
at
yours
but
you
mustnâ€™t
let
me
forget
the
time
you
must
look
after
the
time
for
meâ€™
â€˜itâ€™s
about
a
quarter
to
tenâ€™
said
lawford
having
glanced
first
at
the
stopped
clock
on
the
chimney-piece
and
then
at
his
watch
he
then
sat
quite
still
and
endeavoured
to
sit
at
ease
while
the
old
lady
lifted
her
bonneted
head
and
ever
so
gravely
and
benignly
surveyed
him
â€˜hâ€™mâ€™
she
said
at
last
â€˜thereâ€™s
no
mistaking
you
itâ€™s
maryâ€™s
chin
and
maryâ€™s
brow--with
just
a
little
something
perhaps
of
her
dreamy
eye
but
you
havenâ€™t
all
her
looks
mr
lawford
by
any
manner
of
means
she
was
a
very
beautiful
girl
and
so
vivacious
so
fanciful--it
was
i
suppose
the
foreign
strain
showing
itself
even
marriage
did
not
quite
succeed
in
spoiling
herâ€™
â€˜the
foreign
strainâ€™
lawford
glanced
with
a
kind
of
fleeting
fixity
at
the
quiet
old
figure
â€˜the
foreign
strainâ€™

motherâ€™s
maiden

dear
mr
lawford
surely
memory
does
not
deceive
me
in
that

gucht
that
i
believe
is
a
foreign
nameâ€™
â€˜ah
yesâ€™
said
lawford
his
rising
thoughts
sinking
quietly
to
rest
again
â€˜van
der
gucht
of
course
i--how
stupid
of
meâ€™
â€˜as
a
matter
of
fact
your
mother
was
very
proud
of
her
dutch
blood
but
thereâ€™
she
flung
out
little
fin-like
sleeves
â€˜if
you
donâ€™t
let
me
keep
to
my
story
i
shall
go
back
as
uneasy
as
i
came
and
you
didnâ€™tâ€™
she
added
even
more
fretfully
â€˜you
didnâ€™t
tell
me
the
timeâ€™
lawford
stared
at
his
watch
again
for
some
few
moments
without
replying
â€˜itâ€™s
a
few
minutes
to
tenâ€™
he
said
at
last
â€˜dear
me
and
iâ€™m
keeping
the
cabman
i
mast
hurry
on
well
now
i
put
it
to
you
you
shall
be
my
father
confessor--though
i
detest
the
idea
in
real
life--was
i
wrong
was
i
justified
in
professing
to
the
poor
fellow
that
i
detected
a
likeness
when
there
was
extremely
little
likeness
thereâ€™
â€˜what
none
at
allâ€™
cried
lawford
â€˜not
the
faintest
traceâ€™
â€˜my
dear
good
mr
lawfordâ€™
she
expostulated
patting
her
lap
â€˜thereâ€™s
very
little
more
than
a
trace
of
my
dear
beautiful
mary
in
you
her
own
son
how
could
there
be--how
could
you
expect
it
in
him
a
complete
stranger
no
it
was
nothing
but
my
own
foolish
kindliness
it
might
have
been
maryâ€™s
son
for
all
that
i
could
recollect
i
havenâ€™t
for
years
please
remember
had
the
pleasure
of
receiving
a
visit
from
you
i
am
firmly
of
opinionthat
i
was
justified
my
motive
was
entirely
benevolent
and
then--to
my
positive
amazement--well
i
wonâ€™t
say
hard
things
of
the
absent
but
he
suddenly
turns
round
on
me
with
a
â€œthank
you
miss
bennettâ€
bennett
hark
ye
perhaps
you
wonâ€™t
agree
that
i
had
any
justification
in
being
vexed
and--and
affronted
at
thatâ€™
â€˜i
think
miss
sinnetâ€™
said
lawford
solemnly
â€˜that
you
were
perfectly
justified
oh
perfectly
i
wonder
even
you
had
the
patience
to
give
the
real
arthur
lawford
a
chance
to
ask
your
forgiveness
for--or
the
strangerâ€™
â€˜well
candidlyâ€™
said
miss
sinnett
severely
â€˜i
was
very
much
scandalised
and
i
shouldnâ€™t
be
here
now
telling
you
my
story
if
it
hadnâ€™t
been
for
your
motherâ€™
â€˜my
motherâ€™
the
old
lady
rather
grimly
enjoyed
his
confusion
â€˜yes
mr
lawford
your
mother
i
donâ€™t
know
why--something
in
his
manner
something
in
his
face--so
dejected
so
unhappy
so--if
it
is
not
uncharitablnesse
to
say
it--so
wild
it
has
haunted
me
i
havenâ€™t
been
able
to
put
the
matter
out
of
my
mind
i
have
lain
awake
in
my
bed
thinking
of
him
why
did
he
speak
to
me
i
keep
asking
myself
why
did
he
play
me
so
very
aimless
a
trick
how
had
he
learned
my
name
why
was
he
sitting
there
so
solitary
and
so
dejected
and
worse
even
than
that
what
has
become
of
him
a
little
more
patience
a
little
more
charity
perhaps--what
might
i
not
have
done
for
him
the
whole
thing
has
harassed
and
distressed
me
more
than
i
can
say
would
you
believe
it
i
have
actually
twice
and
on
one
occasion
three
times
in
a
day
made
my
way
to
the
seat--hoping
to
see
him
there
and
i
am
not
so
young
as
i
was
and
then
as
i
say
to
crown
all
i
had
a
most
remarkable
dream
about
your
mother
but
thatâ€™s
my
own
affair
elderly
people
like
me
are
used--well
perhaps
i
wonâ€™t
say
used--weâ€™re
not
surprised
or
disturbed
by
visits
from
those
who
have
gone
before
we
live
in
a
sense
among
the
tombs
though
i
would
not
have
you
fancy
itâ€™s
in
any
way
a
morbid
or
unhappy
life
to
lead
we
donâ€™t
talk
about
it--certainly
not
to
young
people
let
them
enjoy
their
eden
while
they
can
though
thereâ€™s
plenty
of
apples
i
fear
on
the
tree
yet
mr
lawfordâ€™
she
leant
forward
and
whispered
it
with
a
big
simple
smile--â€˜we
donâ€™t
even
discuss
it
much
among
ourselves
but
as
one
gets
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
wicket-gate
thereâ€™s
other
company
around
one
than
youâ€™ll
find
in--in
the
directory
and
that
is
why
i
have
just
come
on
here
tonight
very
probably
my
errand
may
seem
to
have
no
meaning
for
you
you
look
ill
but
you
donâ€™t
appear
to
be
in
any
great
trouble
or
adversity
as
i
feared
in
my--well
there--as
i
feared
you
might
be
i
must
say
though
it
seems
a
terribly
empty
house
and
no
lights
tooâ€™
she
slowly
with
a
little
trembling
nodding
of
her
bonnet
turned
her
head
and
glanced
quietly
fixedly
and
unflinchingly
out
of
the
half-open
door
â€˜but
thatâ€™s
not
my
affairâ€™
and
again
she
looked
at
him
for
a
little
while
then
she
stooped
forward
and
touched
him
kindly
and
trustingly
on
the
knee
â€˜trouble
or
no
troubleâ€™
she
said
â€˜itâ€™s
never
too
late
to
remind
a
man
of
his
mother
and
iâ€™m
sure
mr
lawford
iâ€™m
very
glad
to
hear
you
are
struggling
up
out
of
your
illness
again
we
must
keep
a
brave
heart
forty
or
seventy
whichever
we
may
be
â€œwhile
the
evil
days
come
not
nor
the
years
draw
nigh
when
thou
shalt
say
i
have
no
pleasure
in
themâ€
though
they
have
not
come
to
me
even
yet
and
i
trust
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
not
to
youâ€™
she
looked
at
him
without
a
trace
of
emotion
or
constraint
in
her
large
quiet
face
and
their
eyes
met
for
a
moment
in
that
brief
fixed
baffling
fashion
that
seems
to
prove
that
mankind
is
after
all
but
a
dumb
masked
creature
saddled
with
the
vain
illusion
of
speech
â€˜and
now
that
iâ€™ve
eased
my
conscienceâ€™
said
the
old
lady
pulling
down
her
veil
â€˜i
must
beg
pardon
for
intruding
at
such
an
hour
of
the
evening
and
may
i
have
your
arm
down
those
dreadful
steps
really
mr
lawford
judging
from
the
houses
they
erect
for
us
the
builders
must
have
a
very
peculiar
notion
of
mankind
is
the
fly
still
there
i
expressly
told
the
man
to
wait
and
what
i
am
going
to
do
if--â€™
â€˜heâ€™s
thereâ€™
lawford
reassured
her
craning
his
neck
in
their
slow
progress
to
catch
a
peep
into
the
quiet
road
and
like
a
flock
of
birds
scared
by
a
chance
comer
at
their
feeding
in
some
deserted
field
a
whirring
cloud
of
memories
swept
softly
up
in
his
mind--memories
whose
import
he
made
no
effort
to
discover
none
the
less
the
leisurely
descent
became
in
their
company
something
of
a
real
experience
even
in
such
a
brimming
week
â€˜i
hope
some
day
you
will
really
tell
me
your
dreamâ€™
he
said
pushing
the
old
ladyâ€™s
silk
skirts
in
after
her
as
she
slowly
climbed
into
the
carriage
â€˜ah
my
dear
lawford
when
you
are
my
ageâ€™
she
called
back
to
him
groping
her
way
into
the
rather
musty
gloom
â€˜youâ€™ll
dream
such
dreams
for
yourself
lifeâ€™s
not
whatâ€™s
just
the
fashion
and
there
are
queerer
things
to
be
seen
and
heard
just
quietly
in
oneâ€™s
solitude
than
this
busy
life
gives
us
time
to
discover
but
as
for
my
mystifying
bewley
acquaintance--i
confess
i
cannot
make
head
or
tail
of
himâ€™
â€˜was
heâ€™
said
lawford
rather
vaguely
looking
up
into
the
dim
white
face
that
with
its
plumes
filled
nearly
the
whole
carriage
window
â€˜was
his
face
very
unpleasingâ€™
she
raised
a
gloved
hand
â€˜it
has
haunted
me
haunted
me
mr
lawford
its--its
conflict
poor
fellow
i
hope
i
do
hope
he
faced
his
trouble
out
but
i
shall
never
see
him
againâ€™
he
squeezed
the
trembling
kindly
old
hand
â€˜i
bet
miss
sinnetâ€™
he
said
earnestly
â€˜even
your
having
thought
kindly
of
the
poor
beggar
eased
his
mind--whoever
he
may
have
been
i
assure
you
assure
you
of
thatâ€™
â€˜ay
but
i
did
more
than
thinkâ€™
replied
the
old
lady
with
a
chuckle
that
might
have
seemed
even
a
little
derisive
if
it
had
not
been
so
profoundly
magnanimous
he
watched
the
old
black
fly
roll
slowly
off
and
still
smiling
at
miss
sinnetâ€™s
inscrutable
finesse
went
back
into
the
house
â€˜and
now
my
friendâ€™
he
said
addressing
peacefully
the
thronging
darkness
â€˜the
timeâ€™s
nearly
up
for
me
to
go
tooâ€™
he
had
made
up
his
mind
or
rather
it
seemed
as
if
in
the
unregarded
silences
of
this
last
long
talk
his
mind
had
made
up
itself
only
among
impossibilities
had
he
the
shadow
of
a
choice
in
this
old
haunted
house
amid
this
shallow
turmoil
no
practicable
clue
could
show
itself
of
a
way
out
he
would
go
away
for
a
while
he
left
the
door
ajar
behind
him
for
the
moments
still
left
and
stood
for
a
while
thinking
then
lamp
in
hand
he
descended
into
the
breakfast-room
for
pen
ink
and
paper
he
sat
for
some
time
in
that
underground
calm
nibbling
his
pen
like
a
harassed
and
self-conscious
schoolboy
at
last
he
began
â€˜my
dear
sheila--i
must
tell
you
to
begin
with
that
the
change
has
now
all
passed
away
i
am--as
near
as
man
can
be--completely
myself
again
and
next
that
i
overheard
all
that
was
said
to-night
in
the
dining-room
â€˜iâ€™m
sorry
for
listening
but
itâ€™s
no
good
going
over
all
that
now
here
i
am
and
as
you
said
for
aliceâ€™s
sake
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
i
am
going
away
for
a
while
to
get
if
i
can
a
chance
to
quiet
down
i
suppose
every
one
comes
sooner
or
later
to
a
time
in
life
when
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
but
just
shut
oneâ€™s
eyes
and
blunder
on
and
thatâ€™s
all
i
can
do
now--blunder
onâ€™
he
paused
and
suddenly
at
the
echo
of
the
words
in
his
mind
a
revulsion
of
feeling--shame
and
hatred
of
himself
surged
up
and
he
tore
his
letter
into
tiny
pieces
once
more
he
began
â€˜my
dear
sheilaâ€™
dropped
his
pen
sat
on
for
a
long
time
cold
and
inert
harbouring
almost
unendurably
a
pitiful
hopeless
longing
he
would
write
to
grisel
another
day
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
his
fingers
pressed
against
his
eyelids
and
clearer
than
those
which
myriad-hued
reality
can
ever
present
pictures
of
the
imagination
swam
up
before
his
eyes
it
seemed
indeed
that
even
now
some
ghost
some
revenant
of
himself
was
sitting
there
in
the
old
green
churchyard
roofed
only
with
a
thousand
thousand
stars
the
breath
of
darkness
stirred
softly
on
his
cheek
some
little
scampering
shape
slipped
by
a
bird
on
high
cried
weirdly
solemnly
over
the
globe
he
shuddered
faintly
and
looked
out
again
into
the
small
lamplit
room
here
too
was
quite
as
inexplicable
a
coming
and
going
a
fly
was
walking
on
the
table
beneath
his
eyes
with
the
uneasy
gait
of
one
that
has
outlived
his
hour
and
most
of
his
companions
mice
were
scampering
and
shrieking
in
the
empty
kitchen
and
all
about
him
in
the
viewless
air
the
phantoms
of
another
life
passed
by
unmindful
of
his
motionless
body
he
fell
into
a
lethargy
of
the
senses
and
only
gradually
became
aware
after
a
while
of
the
strange
long-drawn
sigh
of
rain
at
the
window
he
rose
and
opened
it
the
night
air
flowed
in
chilled
with
its
waters
and
faintly
fragrant
of
the
dust
it
soothed
away
all
thought
for
a
while
he
turned
back
to
his
chair
he
would
wait
until
the
rain
had
lulled
before
starting
a
little
before
midnight
the
door
was
softly
and
with
extreme
care
pushed
open
and
mr
bethanyâ€™s
old
face
with
an
intense
and
sharpened
scrutiny
looked
in
on
the
lamplit
room
and
as
if
still
intent
on
the
least
sound
within
the
empty
walls
around
him
he
came
near
and
stooping
across
the
table
stared
through
his
spectacles
at
the
sidelong
face
of
his
friend
so
still
with
hands
so
lightly
laid
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
that
the
old
man
had
need
to
watch
closely
to
detect
in
his
heavy
slumber
the
slow
measured
rise
and
fall
of
his
breast
he
turned
wearily
away
muttering
a
little
between
an
immeasurable
relief
and
a
now
almost
intolerable
medley
of
vexations
what
was
this
monstrous
web
of
craikâ€™s
what
had
the
creature
been
nodding
and
ducketing
about--those
whisperings
that
tattling
and
what
in
the
end
when
you
were
old
and
sour
and
out-strategied
what
was
the
end
to
be
of
this
urgent
dream
called
life
he
sat
quietly
down
and
drew
his
hands
over
his
face
pushed
his
lean
knotted
fingers
up
under
his
spectacles
then
sat
blinking--and
softly
slowly
deciphered
the
solitary
â€˜my
dear
sheilaâ€™
on
lawfordâ€™s
note-paper
â€˜hâ€™mâ€™
he
muttered
and
looked
up
again
at
the
dark
still
eyelids
that
in
the
strange
torpor
of
sleep
might
yet
be
dimly
conveying
to
the
dreaming
brain
behind
them
some
hint
of
his
presence
â€˜i
wish
to
goodness
you
wonderful
old
creatureâ€™
he
muttered
wagging
his
head
â€˜i
wish
to
goodness
youâ€™d
wake
upâ€™
for
some
time
he
sat
on
listening
to
the
still
soft
downpour
on
the
fading
leaves
â€˜they
donâ€™t
come
to
meâ€™
he
said
softly
again
with
a
tiny
smile
on
his
old
face
â€˜itâ€™s
that
old
medieval
craik
with
a
face
like
a
last
yearâ€™s
rookeryâ€™
and
again
he
sat
with
head
a
little
sidelong
listening
now
to
the
infinitesimal
sounds
of
life
without
now
to
the
thoughts
within
and
ever
and
again
he
gazed
steadfastly
on
lawford
at
last
it
seemed
in
the
haunted
quietness
other
thoughts
came
to
him
a
cloud
as
it
were
of
youth
drew
over
the
wrinkled
skin
composed
the
birdlike
keenness
his
head
nodded
once
like
lawford
in
the
darkness
at
widderstone
he
glanced
up
sharply
across
the
lamplight
at
his
phantasmagorical
shadowy
companion
heard
the
steady
surge
of
multitudinous
rain-drops
like
the
roar
of
timeâ€™s
winged
chariot
hurrying
near
then
he
too
with
spectacles
awry
bobbed
on
in
his
chair
a
weary
old
sentinel
on
the
outskirts
of
his
friendâ€™s
denuded
battlefield
