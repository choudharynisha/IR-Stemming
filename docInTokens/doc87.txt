upon
my
return
to
the
united
states
a
few
months
ago
after
the
extraordinary
series
of
adventure
in
the
south
seas
and
elsewhere
of
which
an
account
is
given
in
the
following
pages
accident
threw
me
into
the
society
of
several
gentlemen
in
richmond
va
who
felt
deep
interest
in
all
matters
relating
to
the
regions
i
had
visited
and
who
were
constantly
urging
it
upon
me
as
a
duty
to
give
my
narrative
to
the
public
i
had
several
reasons
however
for
declining
to
do
so
some
of
which
were
of
a
nature
altogether
private
and
concern
no
person
but
myself
others
not
so
much
so
one
consideration
which
deterred
me
was
that
having
kept
no
journal
during
a
greater
portion
of
the
time
in
which
i
was
absent
i
feared
i
should
not
be
able
to
write
from
mere
memory
a
statement
so
minute
and
connected
as
to
have
the
appearance
of
that
truth
it
would
really
possess
barring
only
the
natural
and
unavoidable
exaggeration
to
which
all
of
us
are
prone
when
detailing
events
which
have
had
powerful
influence
in
exciting
the
imaginative
faculties
another
reason
was
that
the
incidents
to
be
narrated
were
of
a
nature
so
positively
marvellous
that
unsupported
as
my
assertions
must
necessarily
be
except
by
the
evidence
of
a
single
individual
and
he
a
half-breed
indian
i
could
only
hope
for
belief
among
my
family
and
those
of
my
friends
who
have
had
reason
through
life
to
put
faith
in
my
veracity--the
probability
being
that
the
public
at
large
would
regard
what
i
should
put
forth
as
merely
an
impudent
and
ingenious
fiction
a
distrust
in
my
own
abilities
as
a
writer
was
nevertheless
one
of
the
principal
causes
which
prevented
me
from
complying
with
the
suggestions
of
my
advisers
among
those
gentlemen
in
virginia
who
expressed
the
greatest
interest
in
my
statement
more
particularly
in
regard
to
that
portion
of
it
which
related
to
the
antarctic
ocean
was
mr
poe
lately
editor
of
the
â€œsouthern
literary
messengerâ€
a
monthly
magazine
published
by
mr
thomas
w
white
in
the
city
of
richmond
he
strongly
advised
me
among
others
to
prepare
at
once
a
full
account
of
what
i
had
seen
and
undergone
and
trust
to
the
shrewdness
and
common-sense
of
the
public--insisting
with
great
plausibility
that
however
roughly
as
regards
mere
authorship
my
book
should
be
got
up
its
very
uncouthness
if
there
were
any
would
give
it
all
the
better
chance
of
being
received
as
truth
notwithstanding
this
representation
i
did
not
make
up
my
mind
to
do
as
he
suggested
he
afterward
proposed
finding
that
i
would
not
stir
in
the
matter
that
i
should
allow
him
to
draw
up
in
his
own
words
a
narrative
of
the
earlier
portion
of
my
adventures
from
facts
afforded
by
myself
publishing
it
in
the
â€œsouthern
messengerâ€
under
the
garb
of
fiction
to
this
perceiving
no
objection
i
consented
stipulating
only
that
my
real
name
should
be
retained
two
numbers
of
the
pretended
fiction
appeared
consequently
in
the
â€œmessengerâ€
for
january
and
february
1837
and
in
order
that
it
might
certainly
be
regarded
as
fiction
the
name
of
mr
poe
was
affixed
to
the
articles
in
the
table
of
contents
of
the
magazine
the
manner
in
which
this
ruse
was
received
has
induced
me
at
length
to
undertake
a
regular
compilation
and
publication
of
the
adventures
in
question
for
i
found
that
in
spite
of
the
air
of
fable
which
had
been
so
ingeniously
thrown
around
that
portion
of
my
statement
which
appeared
in
the
â€œmessengerâ€
without
altering
or
distorting
a
single
fact
the
public
were
still
not
at
all
disposed
to
receive
it
as
fable
and
several
letters
were
sent
to
mr
pâ€™s
address
distinctly
expressing
a
conviction
to
the
contrary
i
thence
concluded
that
the
facts
of
my
narrative
would
prove
of
such
a
nature
as
to
carry
with
them
sufficient
evidence
of
their
own
authenticity
and
that
i
had
consequently
little
to
fear
on
the
score
of
popular
incredulity
this
exposã©
being
made
it
will
be
seen
at
once
how
much
of
what
follows
i
claim
to
be
my
own
writing
and
it
will
also
be
understood
that
no
fact
is
misrepresented
in
the
first
few
pages
which
were
written
by
mr
poe
even
to
those
readers
who
have
not
seen
the
â€œmessengerâ€
it
will
be
unnecessary
to
point
out
where
his
portion
ends
and
my
own
commences
the
difference
in
point
of
style
will
be
readily
perceived
a
g
pym
my
name
is
arthur
gordon
pym
my
father
was
a
respectable
trader
in
sea-stores
at
nantucket
where
i
was
born
my
maternal
grandfather
was
an
attorney
in
good
practice
he
was
fortunate
in
every
thing
and
had
speculated
very
successfully
in
stocks
of
the
edgarton
new
bank
as
it
was
formerly
called
by
these
and
other
means
he
had
managed
to
lay
by
a
tolerable
sum
of
money
he
was
more
attached
to
myself
i
believe
than
to
any
other
person
in
the
world
and
i
expected
to
inherit
the
most
of
his
property
at
his
death
he
sent
me
at
six
years
of
age
to
the
school
of
old
mr
ricketts
a
gentleman
with
only
one
arm
and
of
eccentric
manners--he
is
well
known
to
almost
every
person
who
has
visited
new
bedford
i
stayed
at
his
school
until
i
was
sixteen
when
i
left
him
for
mr
e
ronaldâ€™s
academy
on
the
hill
here
i
became
intimate
with
the
son
of
mr
barnard
a
sea-captain
who
generally
sailed
in
the
employ
of
lloyd
and
vredenburgh--mr
barnard
is
also
very
well
known
in
new
bedford
and
has
many
relations
i
am
certain
in
edgarton
his
son
was
named
augustus
and
he
was
nearly
two
years
older
than
myself
he
had
been
on
a
whaling
voyage
with
his
father
in
the
john
donaldson
and
was
always
talking
to
me
of
his
adventures
in
the
south
pacific
ocean
i
used
frequently
to
go
home
with
him
and
remain
all
day
and
sometimes
all
night
we
occupied
the
same
bed
and
he
would
be
sure
to
keep
me
awake
until
almost
light
telling
me
stories
of
the
natives
of
the
island
of
tinian
and
other
places
he
had
visited
in
his
travels
at
last
i
could
not
help
being
interested
in
what
he
said
and
by
degrees
i
felt
the
greatest
desire
to
go
to
sea
i
owned
a
sailboat
called
the
ariel
and
worth
about
seventy-five
dollars
she
had
a
half-deck
or
cuddy
and
was
rigged
sloop-fashion--i
forget
her
tonnage
but
she
would
hold
ten
persons
without
much
crowding
in
this
boat
we
were
in
the
habit
of
going
on
some
of
the
maddest
freaks
in
the
world
and
when
i
now
think
of
them
it
appears
to
me
a
thousand
wonders
that
i
am
alive
to-day
i
will
relate
one
of
these
adventures
by
way
of
introduction
to
a
longer
and
more
momentous
narrative
one
night
there
was
a
party
at
mr
barnardâ€™s
and
both
augustus
and
myself
were
not
a
little
intoxicated
toward
the
close
of
it
as
usual
in
such
cases
i
took
part
of
his
bed
in
preference
to
going
home
he
went
to
sleep
as
i
thought
very
quietly
it
being
near
one
when
the
party
broke
up
and
without
saying
a
word
on
his
favorite
topic
it
might
have
been
half
an
hour
from
the
time
of
our
getting
in
bed
and
i
was
just
about
falling
into
a
doze
when
he
suddenly
started
up
and
swore
with
a
terrible
oath
that
he
would
not
go
to
sleep
for
any
arthur
pym
in
christendom
when
there
was
so
glorious
a
breeze
from
the
southwest
i
never
was
so
astonished
in
my
life
not
knowing
what
he
intended
and
thinking
that
the
wines
and
liquors
he
had
drunk
had
set
him
entirely
beside
himself
he
proceeded
to
talk
very
coolly
however
saying
he
knew
that
i
supposed
him
intoxicated
but
that
he
was
never
more
sober
in
his
life
he
was
only
tired
he
added
of
lying
in
bed
on
such
a
fine
night
like
a
dog
and
was
determined
to
get
up
and
dress
and
go
out
on
a
frolic
with
the
boat
i
can
hardly
tell
what
possessed
me
but
the
words
were
no
sooner
out
of
his
mouth
than
i
felt
a
thrill
of
the
greatest
excitement
and
pleasure
and
thought
his
mad
idea
one
of
the
most
delightful
and
most
reasonable
things
in
the
world
it
was
blowing
almost
a
gale
and
the
weather
was
very
cold--it
being
late
in
october
i
sprang
out
of
bed
nevertheless
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
and
told
him
i
was
quite
as
brave
as
himself
and
quite
as
tired
as
he
was
of
lying
in
bed
like
a
dog
and
quite
as
ready
for
any
fun
or
frolic
as
any
augustus
barnard
in
nantucket
we
lost
no
time
in
getting
on
our
clothes
and
hurrying
down
to
the
boat
she
was
lying
at
the
old
decayed
wharf
by
the
lumber-yard
of
pankey

co
and
almost
thumping
her
side
out
against
the
rough
logs
augustus
got
into
her
and
bailed
her
for
she
was
nearly
half
full
of
water
this
being
done
we
hoisted
jib
and
mainsail
kept
full
and
started
boldly
out
to
sea
the
wind
as
i
before
said
blew
freshly
from
the
southwest
the
night
was
very
clear
and
cold
augustus
had
taken
the
helm
and
i
stationed
myself
by
the
mast
on
the
deck
of
the
cuddy
we
flew
along
at
a
great
rate--neither
of
us
having
said
a
word
since
casting
loose
from
the
wharf
i
now
asked
my
companion
what
course
he
intended
to
steer
and
what
time
he
thought
it
probable
we
should
get
back
he
whistled
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
said
crustily
â€œi
am
going
to
sea--you
may
go
home
if
you
think
properâ€
turning
my
eyes
upon
him
i
perceived
at
once
that
in
spite
of
his
assumed
nonchalance
he
was
greatly
agitated
i
could
see
him
distinctly
by
the
light
of
the
moon--his
face
was
paler
than
any
marble
and
his
hand
shook
so
excessively
that
he
could
scarcely
retain
hold
of
the
tiller
i
found
that
something
had
gone
wrong
and
became
seriously
alarmed
at
this
period
i
knew
little
about
the
management
of
a
boat
and
was
now
depending
entirely
upon
the
nautical
skill
of
my
friend
the
wind
too
had
suddenly
increased
as
we
were
fast
getting
out
of
the
lee
of
the
land--still
i
was
ashamed
to
betray
any
trepidation
and
for
almost
half
an
hour
maintained
a
resolute
silence
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
however
and
spoke
to
augustus
about
the
propriety
of
turning
back
as
before
it
was
nearly
a
minute
before
he
made
answer
or
took
any
notice
of
my
suggestion
â€œby-and-byâ€
said
he
at
length--â€œtime
enough--home
by-and-byâ€
i
had
expected
a
similar
reply
but
there
was
something
in
the
tone
of
these
words
which
filled
me
with
an
indescribable
feeling
of
dread
i
again
looked
at
the
speaker
attentively
his
lips
were
perfectly
livid
and
his
knees
shook
so
violently
together
that
he
seemed
scarcely
able
to
stand
â€œfor
godâ€™s
sake
augustusâ€
i
screamed
now
heartily
frightened
â€œwhat
ails
you--what
is
the
matter--what
are
you
going
to
doâ€
â€œmatterâ€
he
stammered
in
the
greatest
apparent
surprise
letting
go
the
tiller
at
the
same
moment
and
falling
forward
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat--â€œmatter--why
nothing
is
the--matter--going
home--d--d--donâ€™t
you
seeâ€
the
whole
truth
now
flashed
upon
me
i
flew
to
him
and
raised
him
up
he
was
drunk--beastly
drunk--he
could
no
longer
either
stand
speak
or
see
his
eyes
were
perfectly
glazed
and
as
i
let
him
go
in
the
extremity
of
my
despair
he
rolled
like
a
mere
log
into
the
bilge-water
from
which
i
had
lifted
him
it
was
evident
that
during
the
evening
he
had
drunk
far
more
than
i
suspected
and
that
his
conduct
in
bed
had
been
the
result
of
a
highly-concentrated
state
of
intoxication--a
state
which
like
madness
frequently
enables
the
victim
to
imitate
the
outward
demeanour
of
one
in
perfect
possession
of
his
senses
the
coolness
of
the
night
air
however
had
had
its
usual
effect--the
mental
energy
began
to
yield
before
its
influence--and
the
confused
perception
which
he
no
doubt
then
had
of
his
perilous
situation
had
assisted
in
hastening
the
catastrophe
he
was
now
thoroughly
insensible
and
there
was
no
probability
that
he
would
be
otherwise
for
many
hours
it
is
hardly
possible
to
conceive
the
extremity
of
my
terror
the
fumes
of
the
wine
lately
taken
had
evaporated
leaving
me
doubly
timid
and
irresolute
i
knew
that
i
was
altogether
incapable
of
managing
the
boat
and
that
a
fierce
wind
and
strong
ebb
tide
were
hurrying
us
to
destruction
a
storm
was
evidently
gathering
behind
us
we
had
neither
compass
nor
provisions
and
it
was
clear
that
if
we
held
our
present
course
we
should
be
out
of
sight
of
land
before
daybreak
these
thoughts
with
a
crowd
of
others
equally
fearful
flashed
through
my
mind
with
a
bewildering
rapidity
and
for
some
moments
paralyzed
me
beyond
the
possibility
of
making
any
exertion
the
boat
was
going
through
the
water
at
a
terrible
rate--full
before
the
wind--no
reef
in
either
jib
or
mainsail--running
her
bows
completely
under
the
foam
it
was
a
thousand
wonders
she
did
not
broach
to--augustus
having
let
go
the
tiller
as
i
said
before
and
i
being
too
much
agitated
to
think
of
taking
it
myself
by
good
luck
however
she
kept
steady
and
gradually
i
recovered
some
degree
of
presence
of
mind
still
the
wind
was
increasing
fearfully
and
whenever
we
rose
from
a
plunge
forward
the
sea
behind
fell
combing
over
our
counter
and
deluged
us
with
water
i
was
so
utterly
benumbed
too
in
every
limb
as
to
be
nearly
unconscious
of
sensation
at
length
i
summoned
up
the
resolution
of
despair
and
rushing
to
the
mainsail
let
it
go
by
the
run
as
might
have
been
expected
it
flew
over
the
bows
and
getting
drenched
with
water
carried
away
the
mast
short
off
by
the
board
this
latter
accident
alone
saved
me
from
instant
destruction
under
the
jib
only
i
now
boomed
along
before
the
wind
shipping
heavy
seas
occasionally
over
the
counter
but
relieved
from
the
terror
of
immediate
death
i
took
the
helm
and
breathed
with
greater
freedom
as
i
found
that
there
yet
remained
to
us
a
chance
of
ultimate
escape
augustus
still
lay
senseless
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
as
there
was
imminent
danger
of
his
drowning
the
water
being
nearly
a
foot
deep
just
where
he
fell
i
contrived
to
raise
him
partially
up
and
keep
him
in
a
sitting
position
by
passing
a
rope
round
his
waist
and
lashing
it
to
a
ringbolt
in
the
deck
of
the
cuddy
having
thus
arranged
every
thing
as
well
as
i
could
in
my
chilled
and
agitated
condition
i
recommended
myself
to
god
and
made
up
my
mind
to
bear
whatever
might
happen
with
all
the
fortitude
in
my
power
hardly
had
i
come
to
this
resolution
when
suddenly
a
loud
and
long
scream
or
yell
as
if
from
the
throats
of
a
thousand
demons
seemed
to
pervade
the
whole
atmosphere
around
and
above
the
boat
never
while
i
live
shall
i
forget
the
intense
agony
of
terror
i
experienced
at
that
moment
my
hair
stood
erect
on
my
head--i
felt
the
blood
congealing
in
my
veins--my
heart
ceased
utterly
to
beat
and
without
having
once
raised
my
eyes
to
learn
the
source
of
my
alarm
i
tumbled
headlong
and
insensible
upon
the
body
of
my
fallen
companion
i
found
myself
upon
reviving
in
the
cabin
of
a
large
whaling-ship
the
penguin
bound
to
nantucket
several
persons
were
standing
over
me
and
augustus
paler
than
death
was
busily
occupied
in
chafing
my
hands
upon
seeing
me
open
my
eyes
his
exclamations
of
gratitude
and
joy
excited
alternate
laughter
and
tears
from
the
rough-looking
personages
who
were
present
the
mystery
of
our
being
in
existence
was
now
soon
explained
we
had
been
run
down
by
the
whaling-ship
which
was
close-hauled
beating
up
to
nantucket
with
every
sail
she
could
venture
to
set
and
consequently
running
almost
at
right
angles
to
our
own
course
several
men
were
on
the
look-out
forward
but
did
not
perceive
our
boat
until
it
was
an
impossibility
to
avoid
coming
in
contact--their
shouts
of
warning
upon
seeing
us
were
what
so
terribly
alarmed
me
the
huge
ship
i
was
told
rode
immediately
over
us
with
as
much
ease
as
our
own
little
vessel
would
have
passed
over
a
feather
and
without
the
least
perceptible
impediment
to
her
progress
not
a
scream
arose
from
the
deck
of
the
victim--there
was
a
slight
grating
sound
to
be
heard
mingling
with
the
roar
of
wind
and
water
as
the
frail
bark
which
was
swallowed
up
rubbed
for
a
moment
along
the
keel
of
her
destroyer--but
this
was
all
thinking
our
boat
which
it
will
be
remembered
was
dismasted
some
mere
shell
cut
adrift
as
useless
the
captain
captain
e
t
v
block
of
new
london
was
for
proceeding
on
his
course
without
troubling
himself
further
about
the
matter
luckily
there
were
two
of
the
look-out
who
swore
positively
to
having
seen
some
person
at
our
helm
and
represented
the
possibility
of
yet
saving
him
a
discussion
ensued
when
block
grew
angry
and
after
a
while
said
that
â€œit
was
no
business
of
his
to
be
eternally
watching
for
egg-shells
that
the
ship
should
not
put
about
for
any
such
nonsense
and
if
there
was
a
man
run
down
it
was
nobodyâ€™s
fault
but
his
own
he
might
drown
and
be
dammedâ€
or
some
language
to
that
effect
henderson
the
first
mate
now
took
the
matter
up
being
justly
indignant
as
well
as
the
whole
shipâ€™s
crew
at
a
speech
evincing
so
base
a
degree
of
heartless
atrocity
he
spoke
plainly
seeing
himself
upheld
by
the
men
told
the
captain
he
considered
him
a
fit
subject
for
the
gallows
and
that
he
would
disobey
his
orders
if
he
were
hanged
for
it
the
moment
he
set
his
foot
on
shore
he
strode
aft
jostling
block
who
turned
pale
and
made
no
answer
on
one
side
and
seizing
the
helm
gave
the
word
in
a
firm
voice
hard-a-lee
the
men
flew
to
their
posts
and
the
ship
went
cleverly
about
all
this
had
occupied
nearly
five
minutes
and
it
was
supposed
to
be
hardly
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
any
individual
could
be
saved--allowing
any
to
have
been
on
board
the
boat
yet
as
the
reader
has
seen
both
augustus
and
myself
were
rescued
and
our
deliverance
seemed
to
have
been
brought
about
by
two
of
those
almost
inconceivable
pieces
of
good
fortune
which
are
attributed
by
the
wise
and
pious
to
the
special
interference
of
providence
while
the
ship
was
yet
in
stays
the
mate
lowered
the
jolly-boat
and
jumped
into
her
with
the
very
two
men
i
believe
who
spoke
up
as
having
seen
me
at
the
helm
they
had
just
left
the
lee
of
the
vessel
the
moon
still
shining
brightly
when
she
made
a
long
and
heavy
roll
to
windward
and
henderson
at
the
same
moment
starting
up
in
his
seat
bawled
out
to
his
crew
to
back
water
he
would
say
nothing
else--repeating
his
cry
impatiently
back
water
back
water
the
men
put
back
as
speedily
as
possible
but
by
this
time
the
ship
had
gone
round
and
gotten
fully
under
headway
although
all
hands
on
board
were
making
great
exertions
to
take
in
sail
in
despite
of
the
danger
of
the
attempt
the
mate
clung
to
the
main-chains
as
soon
as
they
came
within
his
reach
another
huge
lurch
now
brought
the
starboard
side
of
the
vessel
out
of
water
nearly
as
far
as
her
keel
when
the
cause
of
his
anxiety
was
rendered
obvious
enough
the
body
of
a
man
was
seen
to
be
affixed
in
the
most
singular
manner
to
the
smooth
and
shining
bottom
the
penguin
was
coppered
and
copper-fastened
and
beating
violently
against
it
with
every
movement
of
the
hull
after
several
ineffectual
efforts
made
during
the
lurches
of
the
ship
and
at
the
imminent
risk
of
swamping
the
boat
i
was
finally
disengaged
from
my
perilous
situation
and
taken
on
board--for
the
body
proved
to
be
my
own
it
appeared
that
one
of
the
timber-bolts
having
started
and
broken
a
passage
through
the
copper
it
had
arrested
my
progress
as
i
passed
under
the
ship
and
fastened
me
in
so
extraordinary
a
manner
to
her
bottom
the
head
of
the
bolt
had
made
its
way
through
the
collar
of
the
green
baize
jacket
i
had
on
and
through
the
back
part
of
my
neck
forcing
itself
out
between
two
sinews
and
just
below
the
right
ear
i
was
immediately
put
to
bed--although
life
seemed
to
be
totally
extinct
there
was
no
surgeon
on
board
the
captain
however
treated
me
with
every
attention--to
make
amends
i
presume
in
the
eyes
of
his
crew
for
his
atrocious
behaviour
in
the
previous
portion
of
the
adventure
in
the
meantime
henderson
had
again
put
off
from
the
ship
although
the
wind
was
now
blowing
almost
a
hurricane
he
had
not
been
gone
many
minutes
when
he
fell
in
with
some
fragments
of
our
boat
and
shortly
afterward
one
of
the
men
with
him
asserted
that
he
could
distinguish
a
cry
for
help
at
intervals
amid
the
roaring
of
the
tempest
this
induced
the
hardy
seamen
to
persevere
in
their
search
for
more
than
half
an
hour
although
repeated
signals
to
return
were
made
them
by
captain
block
and
although
every
moment
on
the
water
in
so
frail
a
boat
was
fraught
to
them
with
the
most
imminent
and
deadly
peril
indeed
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
conceive
how
the
small
jolly
they
were
in
could
have
escaped
destruction
for
a
single
instant
she
was
built
however
for
the
whaling
service
and
was
fitted
as
i
have
since
had
reason
to
believe
with
air-boxes
in
the
manner
of
some
life-boats
used
on
the
coast
of
wales
after
searching
in
vain
for
about
the
period
of
time
just
mentioned
it
was
determined
to
get
back
to
the
ship
they
had
scarcely
made
this
resolve
when
a
feeble
cry
arose
from
a
dark
object
that
floated
rapidly
by
they
pursued
and
soon
overtook
it
it
proved
to
be
the
entire
deck
of
the
arielâ€™s
cuddy
augustus
was
struggling
near
it
apparently
in
the
last
agonies
upon
getting
hold
of
him
it
was
found
that
he
was
attached
by
a
rope
to
the
floating
timber
this
rope
it
will
be
remembered
i
had
myself
tied
around
his
waist
and
made
fast
to
a
ringbolt
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
him
in
an
upright
position
and
my
so
doing
it
appeared
had
been
ultimately
the
means
of
preserving
his
life
the
ariel
was
slightly
put
together
and
in
going
down
her
frame
naturally
went
to
pieces
the
deck
of
the
cuddy
as
might
have
been
expected
was
lifted
by
the
force
of
the
water
rushing
in
entirely
from
the
main
timbers
and
floated
with
other
fragments
no
doubt
to
the
surface--augustus
was
buoyed
up
with
it
and
thus
escaped
a
terrible
death
it
was
more
than
an
hour
after
being
taken
on
board
the
penguin
before
he
could
give
any
account
of
himself
or
be
made
to
comprehend
the
nature
of
the
accident
which
had
befallen
our
boat
at
length
he
became
thoroughly
aroused
and
spoke
much
of
his
sensations
while
in
the
water
upon
his
first
attaining
any
degree
of
consciousness
he
found
himself
beneath
the
surface
whirling
round
and
round
with
inconceivable
rapidity
and
with
a
rope
wrapped
in
three
or
four
folds
tightly
about
his
neck
in
an
instant
afterward
he
felt
himself
going
rapidly
upward
when
his
head
striking
violently
against
a
hard
substance
he
again
relapsed
into
insensibility
upon
once
more
reviving
he
was
in
fuller
possession
of
his
reason--this
was
still
however
in
the
greatest
degree
clouded
and
confused
he
now
knew
that
some
accident
had
occurred
and
that
he
was
in
the
water
although
his
mouth
was
above
the
surface
and
he
could
breathe
with
some
freedom
possibly
at
this
period
the
deck
was
drifting
rapidly
before
the
wind
and
drawing
him
after
it
as
he
floated
upon
his
back
of
course
as
long
as
he
could
have
retained
this
position
it
would
have
been
nearly
impossible
that
he
should
be
drowned
presently
a
surge
threw
him
directly
athwart
the
deck
and
this
post
he
endeavored
to
maintain
screaming
at
intervals
for
help
just
before
he
was
discovered
by
mr
henderson
he
had
been
obliged
to
relax
his
hold
through
exhaustion
and
falling
into
the
sea
had
given
himself
up
for
lost
during
the
whole
period
of
his
struggles
he
had
not
the
faintest
recollection
of
the
ariel
nor
of
the
matters
in
connexion
with
the
source
of
his
disaster
a
vague
feeling
of
terror
and
despair
had
taken
entire
possession
of
his
faculties
when
he
was
finally
picked
up
every
power
of
his
mind
had
failed
him
and
as
before
said
it
was
nearly
an
hour
after
getting
on
board
the
penguin
before
he
became
fully
aware
of
his
condition
in
regard
to
myself--i
was
resuscitated
from
a
state
bordering
very
nearly
upon
death
and
after
every
other
means
had
been
tried
in
vain
for
three
hours
and
a
half
by
vigorous
friction
with
flannels
bathed
in
hot
oil--a
proceeding
suggested
by
augustus
the
wound
in
my
neck
although
of
an
ugly
appearance
proved
of
little
real
consequence
and
i
soon
recovered
from
its
effects
the
penguin
got
into
port
about
nine
oâ€™clock
in
the
morning
after
encountering
one
of
the
severest
gales
ever
experienced
off
nantucket
both
augustus
and
myself
managed
to
appear
at
mr
barnardâ€™s
in
time
for
breakfast--which
luckily
was
somewhat
late
owing
to
the
party
over
night
i
suppose
all
at
the
table
were
too
much
fatigued
themselves
to
notice
our
jaded
appearance--of
course
it
would
not
have
borne
a
very
rigid
scrutiny
schoolboys
however
can
accomplish
wonders
in
the
way
of
deception
and
i
verily
believe
not
one
of
our
friends
in
nantucket
had
the
slightest
suspicion
that
the
terrible
story
told
by
some
sailors
in
town
of
their
having
run
down
a
vessel
at
sea
and
drowned
some
thirty
or
forty
poor
devils
had
reference
either
to
the
ariel
my
companion
or
myself
we
two
have
since
very
frequently
talked
the
matter
over--but
never
without
a
shudder
in
one
of
our
conversations
augustus
frankly
confessed
to
me
that
in
his
whole
life
he
had
at
no
time
experienced
so
excruciating
a
sense
of
dismay
as
when
on
board
our
little
boat
he
first
discovered
the
extent
of
his
intoxication
and
felt
himself
sinking
beneath
its
influence
in
no
affairs
of
mere
prejudice
pro
or
con
do
we
deduce
inferences
with
entire
certainty
even
from
the
most
simple
data
it
might
be
supposed
that
a
catastrophe
such
as
i
have
just
related
would
have
effectually
cooled
my
incipient
passion
for
the
sea
on
the
contrary
i
never
experienced
a
more
ardent
longing
for
the
wild
adventures
incident
to
the
life
of
a
navigator
than
within
a
week
after
our
miraculous
deliverance
this
short
period
proved
amply
long
enough
to
erase
from
my
memory
the
shadows
and
bring
out
in
vivid
light
all
the
pleasurably
exciting
points
of
color
all
the
picturesqueness
of
the
late
perilous
accident
my
conversations
with
augustus
grew
daily
more
frequent
and
more
intensely
full
of
interest
he
had
a
manner
of
relating
his
stories
of
the
ocean
more
than
one
half
of
which
i
now
suspect
to
have
been
sheer
fabrications
well
adapted
to
have
weight
with
one
of
my
enthusiastic
temperament
and
somewhat
gloomy
although
glowing
imagination
it
is
strange
too
that
he
most
strongly
enlisted
my
feelings
in
behalf
of
the
life
of
a
seaman
when
he
depicted
his
more
terrible
moments
of
suffering
and
despair
for
the
bright
side
of
the
painting
i
had
a
limited
sympathy
my
visions
were
of
shipwreck
and
famine
of
death
or
captivity
among
barbarian
hordes
of
a
lifetime
dragged
out
in
sorrow
and
tears
upon
some
gray
and
desolate
rock
in
an
ocean
unapproachable
and
unknown
such
visions
or
desires--for
they
amounted
to
desires--are
common
i
have
since
been
assured
to
the
whole
numerous
race
of
the
melancholy
among
men--at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
i
regarded
them
only
as
prophetic
glimpses
of
a
destiny
which
i
felt
myself
in
a
measure
bound
to
fulfil
augustus
thoroughly
entered
into
my
state
of
mind
it
is
probable
indeed
that
our
intimate
communion
had
resulted
in
a
partial
interchange
of
character
about
eighteen
months
after
the
period
of
the
arielâ€™s
disaster
the
firm
of
lloyd
and
vredenburgh
a
house
connected
in
some
manner
with
the
messieurs
enderby
i
believe
of
liverpool
were
engaged
in
repairing
and
fitting
out
the
brig
grampus
for
a
whaling
voyage
she
was
an
old
hulk
and
scarcely
seaworthy
when
all
was
done
to
her
that
could
be
done
i
hardly
know
why
she
was
chosen
in
preference
to
other
good
vessels
belonging
to
the
same
owners--but
so
it
was
mr
barnard
was
appointed
to
command
her
and
augustus
was
going
with
him
while
the
brig
was
getting
ready
he
frequently
urged
upon
me
the
excellency
of
the
opportunity
now
offered
for
indulging
my
desire
of
travel
he
found
me
by
no
means
an
unwilling
listener--yet
the
matter
could
not
be
so
easily
arranged
my
father
made
no
direct
opposition
but
my
mother
went
into
hysterics
at
the
bare
mention
of
the
design
and
more
than
all
my
grandfather
from
whom
i
expected
much
vowed
to
cut
me
off
with
a
shilling
if
i
should
ever
broach
the
subject
to
him
again
these
difficulties
however
so
far
from
abating
my
desire
only
added
fuel
to
the
flame
i
determined
to
go
at
all
hazards
and
having
made
known
my
intentions
to
augustus
we
set
about
arranging
a
plan
by
which
it
might
be
accomplished
in
the
meantime
i
forbore
speaking
to
any
of
my
relations
in
regard
to
the
voyage
and
as
i
busied
myself
ostensibly
with
my
usual
studies
it
was
supposed
that
i
had
abandoned
the
design
i
have
since
frequently
examined
my
conduct
on
this
occasion
with
sentiments
of
displeasure
as
well
as
of
surprise
the
intense
hypocrisy
i
made
use
of
for
the
furtherance
of
my
project--an
hypocrisy
pervading
every
word
and
action
of
my
life
for
so
long
a
period
of
time--could
only
have
been
rendered
tolerable
to
myself
by
the
wild
and
burning
expectation
with
which
i
looked
forward
to
the
fulfilment
of
my
long-cherished
visions
of
travel
in
pursuance
of
my
scheme
of
deception
i
was
necessarily
obliged
to
leave
much
to
the
management
of
augustus
who
was
employed
for
the
greater
part
of
every
day
on
board
the
grampus
attending
to
some
arrangements
for
his
father
in
the
cabin
and
cabin
hold
at
night
however
we
were
sure
to
have
a
conference
and
talk
over
our
hopes
after
nearly
a
month
passed
in
this
manner
without
our
hitting
upon
any
plan
we
thought
likely
to
succeed
he
told
me
at
last
that
he
had
determined
upon
everything
necessary
i
had
a
relation
living
in
new
bedford
a
mr
ross
at
whose
house
i
was
in
the
habit
of
spending
occasionally
two
or
three
weeks
at
a
time
the
brig
was
to
sail
about
the
middle
of
june
june
1827
and
it
was
agreed
that
a
day
or
two
before
her
putting
to
sea
my
father
was
to
receive
a
note
as
usual
from
mr
ross
asking
me
to
come
over
and
spend
a
fortnight
with
robert
and
emmet
his
sons
augustus
charged
himself
with
the
inditing
of
this
note
and
getting
it
delivered
having
set
out
as
supposed
for
new
bedford
i
was
then
to
report
myself
to
my
companion
who
would
contrive
a
hiding-place
for
me
in
the
grampus
this
hiding-place
he
assured
me
would
be
rendered
sufficiently
comfortable
for
a
residence
of
many
days
during
which
i
was
not
to
make
my
appearance
when
the
brig
had
proceeded
so
far
on
her
course
as
to
make
any
turning
back
a
matter
out
of
question
i
should
then
he
said
be
formally
installed
in
all
the
comforts
of
the
cabin
and
as
to
his
father
he
would
only
laugh
heartily
at
the
joke
vessels
enough
would
be
met
with
by
which
a
letter
might
be
sent
home
explaining
the
adventure
to
my
parents
the
middle
of
june
at
length
arrived
and
every
thing
had
been
matured
the
note
was
written
and
delivered
and
on
a
monday
morning
i
left
the
house
for
the
new
bedford
packet
as
supposed
i
went
however
straight
to
augustus
who
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
corner
of
a
street
it
had
been
our
original
plan
that
i
should
keep
out
of
the
way
until
dark
and
then
slip
on
board
the
brig
but
as
there
was
now
a
thick
fog
in
our
favor
it
was
agreed
to
lose
no
time
in
secreting
me
augustus
led
the
way
to
the
wharf
and
i
followed
at
a
little
distance
enveloped
in
a
thick
seamanâ€™s
cloak
which
he
had
brought
with
him
so
that
my
person
might
not
be
easily
recognized
just
as
we
turned
the
second
corner
after
passing
mr
edmundâ€™s
well
who
should
appear
standing
right
in
front
of
me
and
looking
me
full
in
the
face
but
old
mr
peterson
my
grandfather
â€œwhy
bless
my
soul
gordonâ€
said
he
after
a
long
pause
â€œwhy
why--whose
dirty
cloak
is
that
you
have
onâ€
â€œsirâ€
i
replied
assuming
as
well
as
i
could
in
the
exigency
of
the
moment
an
air
of
offended
surprise
and
talking
in
the
gruffest
of
all
imaginable
tones--â€œsir
you
are
a
sumâ€™mat
mistaken--my
name
in
the
first
place
beeâ€™nt
nothing
at
all
like
goddin
and
iâ€™d
want
you
for
to
know
better
you
blackguard
than
to
call
my
new
obercoat
a
darty
oneâ€
for
my
life
i
could
hardly
refrain
from
screaming
with
laughter
at
the
odd
manner
in
which
the
old
gentleman
received
this
handsome
rebuke
he
started
back
two
or
three
steps
turned
first
pale
and
then
excessively
red
threw
up
his
spectacles
then
putting
them
down
ran
full
tilt
at
me
with
his
umbrella
uplifted
he
stopped
short
however
in
his
career
as
if
struck
with
a
sudden
recollection
and
presently
turning
round
hobbled
off
down
the
street
shaking
all
the
while
with
rage
and
muttering
between
his
teeth
â€œwonâ€™t
do--new
glasses--thought
it
was
gordon--d--d
good-for-nothing
salt
water
long
tomâ€
after
this
narrow
escape
we
proceeded
with
greater
caution
and
arrived
at
our
point
of
destination
in
safety
there
were
only
one
or
two
of
the
hands
on
board
and
these
were
busy
forward
doing
something
to
the
forecastle
combings
captain
barnard
we
knew
very
well
was
engaged
at
lloyd
and
vredenburghâ€™s
and
would
remain
there
until
late
in
the
evening
so
we
had
little
to
apprehend
on
his
account
augustus
went
first
up
the
vesselâ€™s
side
and
in
a
short
while
i
followed
him
without
being
noticed
by
the
men
at
work
we
proceeded
at
once
into
the
cabin
and
found
no
person
there
it
was
fitted
up
in
the
most
comfortable
style--a
thing
somewhat
unusual
in
a
whaling-vessel
there
were
four
very
excellent
staterooms
with
wide
and
convenient
berths
there
was
also
a
large
stove
i
took
notice
and
a
remarkably
thick
and
valuable
carpet
covering
the
floor
of
both
the
cabin
and
staterooms
the
ceiling
was
full
seven
feet
high
and
in
short
every
thing
appeared
of
a
more
roomy
and
agreeable
nature
than
i
had
anticipated
augustus
however
would
allow
me
but
little
time
for
observation
insisting
upon
the
necessity
of
my
concealing
myself
as
soon
as
possible
he
led
the
way
into
his
own
stateroom
which
was
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
brig
and
next
to
the
bulkheads
upon
entering
he
closed
the
door
and
bolted
it
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
a
nicer
little
room
than
the
one
in
which
i
now
found
myself
it
was
about
ten
feet
long
and
had
only
one
berth
which
as
i
said
before
was
wide
and
convenient
in
that
portion
of
the
closet
nearest
the
bulkheads
there
was
a
space
of
four
feet
square
containing
a
table
a
chair
and
a
set
of
hanging
shelves
full
of
books
chiefly
books
of
voyages
and
travels
there
were
many
other
little
comforts
in
the
room
among
which
i
ought
not
to
forget
a
kind
of
safe
or
refrigerator
in
which
augustus
pointed
out
to
me
a
host
of
delicacies
both
in
the
eating
and
drinking
department
he
now
pressed
with
his
knuckles
upon
a
certain
spot
of
the
carpet
in
one
corner
of
the
space
just
mentioned
letting
me
know
that
a
portion
of
the
flooring
about
sixteen
inches
square
had
been
neatly
cut
out
and
again
adjusted
as
he
pressed
this
portion
rose
up
at
one
end
sufficiently
to
allow
the
passage
of
his
finger
beneath
in
this
manner
he
raised
the
mouth
of
the
trap
to
which
the
carpet
was
still
fastened
by
tacks
and
i
found
that
it
led
into
the
after
hold
he
next
lit
a
small
taper
by
means
of
a
phosphorous
match
and
placing
the
light
in
a
dark
lantern
descended
with
it
through
the
opening
bidding
me
follow
i
did
so
and
he
then
pulled
the
cover
upon
the
hole
by
means
of
a
nail
driven
into
the
under
side--the
carpet
of
course
resuming
its
original
position
on
the
floor
of
the
stateroom
and
all
traces
of
the
aperture
being
concealed
the
taper
gave
out
so
feeble
a
ray
that
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
i
could
grope
my
way
through
the
confused
mass
of
lumber
among
which
i
now
found
myself
by
degrees
however
my
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
gloom
and
i
proceeded
with
less
trouble
holding
on
to
the
skirts
of
my
friendâ€™s
coat
he
brought
me
at
length
after
creeping
and
winding
through
innumerable
narrow
passages
to
an
iron-bound
box
such
as
is
used
sometimes
for
packing
fine
earthenware
it
was
nearly
four
feet
high
and
full
six
long
but
very
narrow
two
large
empty
oil-casks
lay
on
the
top
of
it
and
above
these
again
a
vast
quantity
of
straw
matting
piled
up
as
high
as
the
floor
of
the
cabin
in
every
other
direction
around
was
wedged
as
closely
as
possible
even
up
to
the
ceiling
a
complete
chaos
of
almost
every
species
of
ship-furniture
together
with
a
heterogeneous
medley
of
crates
hampers
barrels
and
bales
so
that
it
seemed
a
matter
no
less
than
miraculous
that
we
had
discovered
any
passage
at
all
to
the
box
i
afterward
found
that
augustus
had
purposely
arranged
the
stowage
in
this
hold
with
a
view
to
affording
me
a
thorough
concealment
having
had
only
one
assistant
in
the
labour
a
man
not
going
out
in
the
brig
my
companion
now
showed
me
that
one
of
the
ends
of
the
box
could
be
removed
at
pleasure
he
slipped
it
aside
and
displayed
the
interior
at
which
i
was
excessively
amused
a
mattress
from
one
of
the
cabin
berths
covered
the
whole
of
its
bottom
and
it
contained
almost
every
article
of
mere
comfort
which
could
be
crowded
into
so
small
a
space
allowing
me
at
the
same
time
sufficient
room
for
my
accommodation
either
in
a
sitting
position
or
lying
at
full
length
among
other
things
there
were
some
books
pen
ink
and
paper
three
blankets
a
large
jug
full
of
water
a
keg
of
sea-biscuit
three
or
four
immense
bologna
sausages
an
enormous
ham
a
cold
leg
of
roast
mutton
and
half
a
dozen
bottles
of
cordials
and
liqueurs
i
proceeded
immediately
to
take
possession
of
my
little
apartment
and
this
with
feelings
of
higher
satisfaction
i
am
sure
than
any
monarch
ever
experienced
upon
entering
a
new
palace
augustus
now
pointed
out
to
me
the
method
of
fastening
the
open
end
of
the
box
and
then
holding
the
taper
close
to
the
deck
showed
me
a
piece
of
dark
whipcord
lying
along
it
this
he
said
extended
from
my
hiding-place
throughout
all
the
necessary
windings
among
the
lumber
to
a
nail
which
was
driven
into
the
deck
of
the
hold
immediately
beneath
the
trap-door
leading
into
his
stateroom
by
means
of
this
cord
i
should
be
enabled
readily
to
trace
my
way
out
without
his
guidance
provided
any
unlooked-for
accident
should
render
such
a
step
necessary
he
now
took
his
departure
leaving
with
me
the
lantern
together
with
a
copious
supply
of
tapers
and
phosphorous
and
promising
to
pay
me
a
visit
as
often
as
he
could
contrive
to
do
so
without
observation
this
was
on
the
seventeenth
of
june
i
remained
three
days
and
nights
as
nearly
as
i
could
guess
in
my
hiding-place
without
getting
out
of
it
at
all
except
twice
for
the
purpose
of
stretching
my
limbs
by
standing
erect
between
two
crates
just
opposite
the
opening
during
the
whole
period
i
saw
nothing
of
augustus
but
this
occasioned
me
little
uneasiness
as
i
knew
the
brig
was
expected
to
put
to
sea
every
hour
and
in
the
bustle
he
would
not
easily
find
opportunities
of
coming
down
to
me
at
length
i
heard
the
trap
open
and
shut
and
presently
he
called
in
a
low
voice
asking
if
all
was
well
and
if
there
was
any
thing
i
wanted
â€œnothingâ€
i
replied
â€œi
am
as
comfortable
as
can
be
when
will
the
brig
sailâ€
â€œshe
will
be
under
weigh
in
less
than
half
an
hourâ€
he
answered
â€œi
came
to
let
you
know
and
for
fear
you
should
be
uneasy
at
my
absence
i
shall
not
have
a
chance
of
coming
down
again
for
some
time--perhaps
for
three
or
four
days
more
all
is
going
on
right
aboveboard
after
i
go
up
and
close
the
trap
do
you
creep
along
by
the
whipcord
to
where
the
nail
is
driven
in
you
will
find
my
watch
there--it
may
be
useful
to
you
as
you
have
no
daylight
to
keep
time
by
i
suppose
you
canâ€™t
tell
how
long
you
have
been
buried--only
three
days--this
is
the
twentieth
i
would
bring
the
watch
to
your
box
but
am
afraid
of
being
missedâ€
with
this
he
went
up
in
about
an
hour
after
he
had
gone
i
distinctly
felt
the
brig
in
motion
and
congratulated
myself
upon
having
at
length
fairly
commenced
a
voyage
satisfied
with
this
idea
i
determined
to
make
my
mind
as
easy
as
possible
and
await
the
course
of
events
until
i
should
be
permitted
to
exchange
the
box
for
the
more
roomy
although
hardly
more
comfortable
accommodations
of
the
cabin
my
first
care
was
to
get
the
watch
leaving
the
taper
burning
i
groped
along
in
the
dark
following
the
cord
through
windings
innumerable
in
some
of
which
i
discovered
that
after
toiling
a
long
distance
i
was
brought
back
within
a
foot
or
two
of
a
former
position
at
length
i
reached
the
nail
and
securing
the
object
of
my
journey
returned
with
it
in
safety
i
now
looked
over
the
books
which
had
been
so
thoughtfully
provided
and
selected
the
expedition
of
lewis
and
clarke
to
the
mouth
of
the
columbia
with
this
i
amused
myself
for
some
time
when
growing
sleepy
i
extinguished
the
light
with
great
care
and
soon
fell
into
a
sound
slumber
upon
awakening
i
felt
strangely
confused
in
mind
and
some
time
elapsed
before
i
could
bring
to
recollection
all
the
various
circumstances
of
my
situation
by
degrees
however
i
remembered
all
striking
a
light
i
looked
at
the
watch
but
it
was
run
down
and
there
were
consequently
no
means
of
determining
how
long
i
slept
my
limbs
were
greatly
cramped
and
i
was
forced
to
relieve
them
by
standing
between
the
crates
presently
feeling
an
almost
ravenous
appetite
i
bethought
myself
of
the
cold
mutton
some
of
which
i
had
eaten
just
before
going
to
sleep
and
found
excellent
what
was
my
astonishment
in
discovering
it
to
be
in
a
state
of
absolute
putrefaction
this
circumstance
occasioned
me
great
disquietude
for
connecting
it
with
the
disorder
of
mind
i
experienced
upon
awakening
i
began
to
suppose
that
i
must
have
slept
for
an
inordinately
long
period
of
time
the
close
atmosphere
of
the
hold
might
have
had
something
to
do
with
this
and
might
in
the
end
be
productive
of
the
most
serious
results
my
head
ached
excessively
i
fancied
that
i
drew
every
breath
with
difficulty
and
in
short
i
was
oppressed
with
a
multitude
of
gloomy
feelings
still
i
could
not
venture
to
make
any
disturbance
by
opening
the
trap
or
otherwise
and
having
wound
up
the
watch
contented
myself
as
well
as
possible
throughout
the
whole
of
the
next
tedious
twenty-four
hours
no
person
came
to
my
relief
and
i
could
not
help
accusing
augustus
of
the
grossest
inattention
what
alarmed
me
chiefly
was
that
the
water
in
my
jug
was
reduced
to
about
half
a
pint
and
i
was
suffering
much
from
thirst
having
eaten
freely
of
the
bologna
sausages
after
the
loss
of
my
mutton
i
became
very
uneasy
and
could
no
longer
take
any
interest
in
my
books
i
was
overpowered
too
with
a
desire
to
sleep
yet
trembled
at
the
thought
of
indulging
it
lest
there
might
exist
some
pernicious
influence
like
that
of
burning
charcoal
in
the
confined
air
of
the
hold
in
the
meantime
the
roll
of
the
brig
told
me
that
we
were
far
in
the
main
ocean
and
a
dull
humming
sound
which
reached
my
ears
as
if
from
an
immense
distance
convinced
me
no
ordinary
gale
was
blowing
i
could
not
imagine
a
reason
for
the
absence
of
augustus
we
were
surely
far
enough
advanced
on
our
voyage
to
allow
of
my
going
up
some
accident
might
have
happened
to
him--but
i
could
think
of
none
which
would
account
for
his
suffering
me
to
remain
so
long
a
prisoner
except
indeed
his
having
suddenly
died
or
fallen
overboard
and
upon
this
idea
i
could
not
dwell
with
any
degree
of
patience
it
was
possible
that
we
had
been
baffled
by
head
winds
and
were
still
in
the
near
vicinity
of
nantucket
this
notion
however
i
was
forced
to
abandon
for
such
being
the
case
the
brig
must
have
frequently
gone
about
and
i
was
entirely
satisfied
from
her
continual
inclination
to
the
larboard
that
she
had
been
sailing
all
along
with
a
steady
breeze
on
her
starboard
quarter
besides
granting
that
we
were
still
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
island
why
should
not
augustus
have
visited
me
and
informed
me
of
the
circumstance
pondering
in
this
manner
upon
the
difficulties
of
my
solitary
and
cheerless
condition
i
resolved
to
wait
yet
another
twenty-four
hours
when
if
no
relief
were
obtained
i
would
make
my
way
to
the
trap
and
endeavour
either
to
hold
a
parley
with
my
friend
or
get
at
least
a
little
fresh
air
through
the
opening
and
a
further
supply
of
water
from
the
stateroom
while
occupied
with
this
thought
however
i
fell
in
spite
of
every
exertion
to
the
contrary
into
a
state
of
profound
sleep
or
rather
stupor
my
dreams
were
of
the
most
terrific
description
every
species
of
calamity
and
horror
befell
me
among
other
miseries
i
was
smothered
to
death
between
huge
pillows
by
demons
of
the
most
ghastly
and
ferocious
aspect
immense
serpents
held
me
in
their
embrace
and
looked
earnestly
in
my
face
with
their
fearfully
shining
eyes
then
deserts
limitless
and
of
the
most
forlorn
and
awe-inspiring
character
spread
themselves
out
before
me
immensely
tall
trunks
of
trees
gray
and
leafless
rose
up
in
endless
succession
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
their
roots
were
concealed
in
wide-spreading
morasses
whose
dreary
water
lay
intensely
black
still
and
altogether
terrible
beneath
and
the
strange
trees
seemed
endowed
with
a
human
vitality
and
waving
to
and
fro
their
skeleton
arms
were
crying
to
the
silent
waters
for
mercy
in
the
shrill
and
piercing
accents
of
the
most
acute
agony
and
despair
the
scene
changed
and
i
stood
naked
and
alone
amidst
the
burning
sand-plains
of
sahara
at
my
feet
lay
crouched
a
fierce
lion
of
the
tropics
suddenly
his
wild
eyes
opened
and
fell
upon
me
with
a
conclusive
bound
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
laid
bare
his
horrible
teeth
in
another
instant
there
burst
from
his
red
throat
a
roar
like
the
thunder
of
the
firmament
and
i
fell
impetuously
to
the
earth
stifling
in
a
paroxysm
of
terror
i
at
last
found
myself
partially
awake
my
dream
then
was
not
all
a
dream
now
at
least
i
was
in
possession
of
my
senses
the
paws
of
some
huge
and
real
monster
were
pressing
heavily
upon
my
bosom--his
hot
breath
was
in
my
ear--and
his
white
and
ghastly
fangs
were
gleaming
upon
me
through
the
gloom
had
a
thousand
lives
hung
upon
the
movement
of
a
limb
or
the
utterance
of
a
syllable
i
could
have
neither
stirred
nor
spoken
the
beast
whatever
it
was
retained
his
position
without
attempting
any
immediate
violence
while
i
lay
in
an
utterly
helpless
and
i
fancied
a
dying
condition
beneath
him
i
felt
that
my
powers
of
body
and
mind
were
fast
leaving
me--in
a
word
that
i
was
perishing
and
perishing
of
sheer
fright
my
brain
swam--i
grew
deadly
sick--my
vision
failed--even
the
glaring
eyeballs
above
me
grew
dim
making
a
last
strong
effort
i
at
length
breathed
a
faint
ejaculation
to
god
and
resigned
myself
to
die
the
sound
of
my
voice
seemed
to
arouse
all
the
latent
fury
of
the
animal
he
precipitated
himself
at
full
length
upon
my
body
but
what
was
my
astonishment
when
with
a
long
and
low
whine
he
commenced
licking
my
face
and
hands
with
the
greatest
eagerness
and
with
the
most
extravagant
demonstration
of
affection
and
joy
i
was
bewildered
utterly
lost
in
amazement--but
i
could
not
forget
the
peculiar
whine
of
my
newfoundland
dog
tiger
and
the
odd
manner
of
his
caresses
i
well
knew
it
was
he
i
experienced
a
sudden
rush
of
blood
to
my
temples--a
giddy
and
overpowering
sense
of
deliverance
and
reanimation
i
rose
hurriedly
from
the
mattress
upon
which
i
had
been
lying
and
throwing
myself
upon
the
neck
of
my
faithful
follower
and
friend
relieved
the
long
oppression
of
my
bosom
in
a
flood
of
the
most
passionate
tears
as
upon
a
former
occasion
my
conceptions
were
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
indistinctness
and
confusion
after
leaving
the
mattress
for
a
long
time
i
found
it
nearly
impossible
to
connect
any
ideas
but
by
very
slow
degrees
my
thinking
faculties
returned
and
i
again
called
to
memory
the
several
incidents
of
my
condition
for
the
presence
of
tiger
i
tried
in
vain
to
account
and
after
busying
myself
with
a
thousand
different
conjectures
respecting
him
was
forced
to
content
myself
with
rejoicing
that
he
was
with
me
to
share
my
dreary
solitude
and
render
me
comfort
by
his
caresses
most
people
love
their
dogs--but
for
tiger
i
had
an
affection
far
more
ardent
than
common
and
never
certainly
did
any
creature
more
truly
deserve
it
for
seven
years
he
had
been
my
inseparable
companion
and
in
a
multitude
of
instances
had
given
evidence
of
all
the
noble
qualities
for
which
we
value
the
animal
i
had
rescued
him
when
a
puppy
from
the
clutches
of
a
malignant
little
villain
in
nantucket
who
was
leading
him
with
a
rope
around
his
neck
to
the
water
and
the
grown
dog
repaid
the
obligation
about
three
years
afterward
by
saving
me
from
the
bludgeon
of
a
street
robber
getting
now
hold
of
the
watch
i
found
upon
applying
it
to
my
ear
that
it
had
again
run
down
but
at
this
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
being
convinced
from
the
peculiar
state
of
my
feelings
that
i
had
slept
as
before
for
a
very
long
period
of
time
how
long
it
was
of
course
impossible
to
say
i
was
burning
up
with
fever
and
my
thirst
was
almost
intolerable
i
felt
about
the
box
for
my
little
remaining
supply
of
water
for
i
had
no
light
the
taper
having
burnt
to
the
socket
of
the
lantern
and
the
phosphorus-box
not
coming
readily
to
hand
upon
finding
the
jug
however
i
discovered
it
to
be
empty--tiger
no
doubt
having
been
tempted
to
drink
it
as
well
as
to
devour
the
remnant
of
mutton
the
bone
of
which
lay
well
picked
by
the
opening
of
the
box
the
spoiled
meat
i
could
well
spare
but
my
heart
sank
as
i
thought
of
the
water
i
was
feeble
in
the
extreme--so
much
so
that
i
shook
all
over
as
with
an
ague
at
the
slightest
movement
or
exertion
to
add
to
my
troubles
the
brig
was
pitching
and
rolling
with
great
violence
and
the
oil-casks
which
lay
upon
my
box
were
in
momentary
danger
of
falling
down
so
as
to
block
up
the
only
way
of
ingress
or
egress
i
felt
also
terrible
sufferings
from
sea-sickness
these
considerations
determined
me
to
make
my
way
at
all
hazards
to
the
trap
and
obtain
immediate
relief
before
i
should
be
incapacitated
from
doing
so
altogether
having
come
to
this
resolve
i
again
felt
about
for
the
phosphorus-box
and
tapers
the
former
i
found
after
some
little
trouble
but
not
discovering
the
tapers
as
soon
as
i
had
expected
for
i
remembered
very
nearly
the
spot
in
which
i
had
placed
them
i
gave
up
the
search
for
the
present
and
bidding
tiger
lie
quiet
began
at
once
my
journey
toward
the
trap
in
this
attempt
my
great
feebleness
became
more
than
ever
apparent
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
i
could
crawl
along
at
all
and
very
frequently
my
limbs
sank
suddenly
from
beneath
me
when
falling
prostrate
on
my
face
i
would
remain
for
some
minutes
in
a
state
bordering
on
insensibility
still
i
struggled
forward
by
slow
degrees
dreading
every
moment
that
i
should
swoon
amid
the
narrow
and
intricate
windings
of
the
lumber
in
which
event
i
had
nothing
but
death
to
expect
as
the
result
at
length
upon
making
a
push
forward
with
all
the
energy
i
could
command
i
struck
my
forehead
violently
against
the
sharp
corner
of
an
iron-bound
crate
the
accident
only
stunned
me
for
a
few
moments
but
i
found
to
my
inexpressible
grief
that
the
quick
and
violent
roll
of
the
vessel
had
thrown
the
crate
entirely
across
my
path
so
as
effectually
to
block
up
the
passage
with
my
utmost
exertions
i
could
not
move
it
a
single
inch
from
its
position
it
being
closely
wedged
in
among
the
surrounding
boxes
and
ship-furniture
it
became
necessary
therefore
enfeebled
as
i
was
either
to
leave
the
guidance
of
the
whipcord
and
seek
out
a
new
passage
or
to
climb
over
the
obstacle
and
resume
the
path
on
the
other
side
the
former
alternative
presented
too
many
difficulties
and
dangers
to
be
thought
of
without
a
shudder
in
my
present
weak
state
of
both
mind
and
body
i
should
infallibly
lose
my
way
if
i
attempted
it
and
perish
miserably
amid
the
dismal
and
disgusting
labyrinths
of
the
hold
i
proceeded
therefore
without
hesitation
to
summon
up
all
my
remaining
strength
and
fortitude
and
endeavour
as
i
best
might
to
clamber
over
the
crate
upon
standing
erect
with
this
end
in
view
i
found
the
undertaking
even
a
more
serious
task
than
my
fears
had
led
me
to
imagine
on
each
side
of
the
narrow
passage
arose
a
complete
wall
of
various
heavy
lumber
which
the
least
blunder
on
my
part
might
be
the
means
of
bringing
down
upon
my
head
or
if
this
accident
did
not
occur
the
path
might
be
effectually
blocked
up
against
my
return
by
the
descending
mass
as
it
was
in
front
by
the
obstacle
there
the
crate
itself
was
a
long
and
unwieldy
box
upon
which
no
foothold
could
be
obtained
in
vain
i
attempted
by
every
means
in
my
power
to
reach
the
top
with
the
hope
of
being
thus
enabled
to
draw
myself
up
had
i
succeeded
in
reaching
it
it
is
certain
that
my
strength
would
have
proved
utterly
inadequate
to
the
task
of
getting
over
and
it
was
better
in
every
respect
that
i
failed
at
length
in
a
desperate
effort
to
force
the
crate
from
its
ground
i
felt
a
strong
vibration
in
the
side
next
me
i
thrust
my
hand
eagerly
to
the
edge
of
the
planks
and
found
that
a
very
large
one
was
loose
with
my
pocket-knife
which
luckily
i
had
with
me
i
succeeded
after
great
labour
in
prying
it
entirely
off
and
getting
it
through
the
aperture
discovered
to
my
exceeding
joy
that
there
were
no
boards
on
the
opposite
side--in
other
words
that
the
top
was
wanting
it
being
the
bottom
through
which
i
had
forced
my
way
i
now
met
with
no
important
difficulty
in
proceeding
along
the
line
until
i
finally
reached
the
nail
with
a
beating
heart
i
stood
erect
and
with
a
gentle
touch
pressed
against
the
cover
of
the
trap
it
did
not
rise
as
soon
as
i
had
expected
and
i
pressed
it
with
somewhat
more
determination
still
dreading
lest
some
other
person
than
augustus
might
be
in
his
state-room
the
door
however
to
my
astonishment
remained
steady
and
i
became
somewhat
uneasy
for
i
knew
that
it
had
formerly
required
but
little
or
no
effort
to
remove
it
i
pushed
it
strongly--it
was
nevertheless
firm
with
all
my
strength--it
still
did
not
give
way
with
rage
with
fury
with
despair--it
set
at
defiance
my
utmost
efforts
and
it
was
evident
from
the
unyielding
nature
of
the
resistance
that
the
hole
had
either
been
discovered
and
effectually
nailed
up
or
that
some
immense
weight
had
been
placed
upon
it
which
it
was
useless
to
think
of
removing
my
sensations
were
those
of
extreme
horror
and
dismay
in
vain
i
attempted
to
reason
on
the
probable
cause
of
my
being
thus
entombed
i
could
summon
up
no
connected
chain
of
reflection
and
sinking
on
the
floor
gave
way
unresistingly
to
the
most
gloomy
imaginings
in
which
the
dreadful
deaths
of
thirst
famine
suffocation
and
premature
interment
crowded
upon
me
as
the
prominent
disasters
to
be
encountered
at
length
there
returned
to
me
some
portion
of
presence
of
mind
i
arose
and
felt
with
my
fingers
for
the
seams
or
cracks
of
the
aperture
having
found
them
i
examined
them
closely
to
ascertain
if
they
emitted
any
light
from
the
state-room
but
none
was
visible
i
then
forced
the
blade
of
my
pen-knife
through
them
until
i
met
with
some
hard
obstacle
scraping
against
it
i
discovered
it
to
be
a
solid
mass
of
iron
which
from
its
peculiar
wavy
feel
as
i
passed
the
blade
along
it
i
concluded
to
be
a
chain-cable
the
only
course
now
left
me
was
to
retrace
my
way
to
the
box
and
there
either
yield
to
my
sad
fate
or
try
so
to
tranquilize
my
mind
as
to
admit
of
my
arranging
some
plan
of
escape
i
immediately
set
about
the
attempt
and
succeeded
after
innumerable
difficulties
in
getting
back
as
i
sank
utterly
exhausted
upon
the
mattress
tiger
threw
himself
at
full
length
by
my
side
and
seemed
as
if
desirous
by
his
caresses
of
consoling
me
in
my
troubles
and
urging
me
to
bear
them
with
fortitude
the
singularity
of
his
behavior
at
length
forcibly
arrested
my
attention
after
licking
my
face
and
hands
for
some
minutes
he
would
suddenly
cease
doing
so
and
utter
a
low
whine
upon
reaching
out
my
hand
toward
him
i
then
invariably
found
him
lying
on
his
back
with
his
paws
uplifted
this
conduct
so
frequently
repeated
appeared
strange
and
i
could
in
no
manner
account
for
it
as
the
dog
seemed
distressed
i
concluded
that
he
had
received
some
injury
and
taking
his
paws
in
my
hands
i
examined
them
one
by
one
but
found
no
sign
of
any
hurt
i
then
supposed
him
hungry
and
gave
him
a
large
piece
of
ham
which
he
devoured
with
avidity--afterward
however
resuming
his
extraordinary
manoeuvres
i
now
imagined
that
he
was
suffering
like
myself
the
torments
of
thirst
and
was
about
adopting
this
conclusion
as
the
true
one
when
the
idea
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
as
yet
only
examined
his
paws
and
that
there
might
possibly
be
a
wound
upon
some
portion
of
his
body
or
head
the
latter
i
felt
carefully
over
but
found
nothing
on
passing
my
hand
however
along
his
back
i
perceived
a
slight
erection
of
the
hair
extending
completely
across
it
probing
this
with
my
finger
i
discovered
a
string
and
tracing
it
up
found
that
it
encircled
the
whole
body
upon
a
closer
scrutiny
i
came
across
a
small
slip
of
what
had
the
feeling
of
letter
paper
through
which
the
string
had
been
fastened
in
such
a
manner
as
to
bring
it
immediately
beneath
the
left
shoulder
of
the
animal
the
thought
instantly
occurred
to
me
that
the
paper
was
a
note
from
augustus
and
that
some
unaccountable
accident
having
happened
to
prevent
his
relieving
me
from
my
dungeon
he
had
devised
this
method
of
acquainting
me
with
the
true
state
of
affairs
trembling
with
eagerness
i
now
commenced
another
search
for
my
phosphorus
matches
and
tapers
i
had
a
confused
recollection
of
having
put
them
carefully
away
just
before
falling
asleep
and
indeed
previously
to
my
last
journey
to
the
trap
i
had
been
able
to
remember
the
exact
spot
where
i
had
deposited
them
but
now
i
endeavored
in
vain
to
call
it
to
mind
and
busied
myself
for
a
full
hour
in
a
fruitless
and
vexatious
search
for
the
missing
articles
never
surely
was
there
a
more
tantalizing
state
of
anxiety
and
suspense
at
length
while
groping
about
with
my
head
close
to
the
ballast
near
the
opening
of
the
box
and
outside
of
it
i
perceived
a
faint
glimmering
of
light
in
the
direction
of
the
steerage
greatly
surprised
i
endeavored
to
make
my
way
toward
it
as
it
appeared
to
be
but
a
few
feet
from
my
position
scarcely
had
i
moved
with
this
intention
when
i
lost
sight
of
the
glimmer
entirely
and
before
i
could
bring
it
into
view
again
was
obliged
to
feel
along
by
the
box
until
i
had
exactly
resumed
my
original
situation
now
moving
my
head
with
caution
to
and
fro
i
found
that
by
proceeding
slowly
with
great
care
in
an
opposite
direction
to
that
in
which
i
had
at
first
started
i
was
enabled
to
draw
near
the
light
still
keeping
it
in
view
presently
i
came
directly
upon
it
having
squeezed
my
way
through
innumerable
narrow
windings
and
found
that
it
proceeded
from
some
fragments
of
my
matches
lying
in
an
empty
barrel
turned
upon
its
side
i
was
wondering
how
they
came
in
such
a
place
when
my
hand
fell
upon
two
or
three
pieces
of
taper
wax
which
had
been
evidently
mumbled
by
the
dog
i
concluded
at
once
that
he
had
devoured
the
whole
of
my
supply
of
candles
and
i
felt
hopeless
of
being
ever
able
to
read
the
note
of
augustus
the
small
remnants
of
the
wax
were
so
mashed
up
among
other
rubbish
in
the
barrel
that
i
despaired
of
deriving
any
service
from
them
and
left
them
as
they
were
the
phosphorus
of
which
there
was
only
a
speck
or
two
i
gathered
up
as
well
as
i
could
and
returned
with
it
after
much
difficulty
to
my
box
where
tiger
had
all
the
while
remained
what
to
do
next
i
could
not
tell
the
hold
was
so
intensely
dark
that
i
could
not
see
my
hand
however
close
i
would
hold
it
to
my
face
the
white
slip
of
paper
could
barely
be
discerned
and
not
even
that
when
i
looked
at
it
directly
by
turning
the
exterior
portions
of
the
retina
toward
it--that
is
to
say
by
surveying
it
slightly
askance
i
found
that
it
became
in
some
measure
perceptible
thus
the
gloom
of
my
prison
may
be
imagined
and
the
note
of
my
friend
if
indeed
it
were
a
note
from
him
seemed
only
likely
to
throw
me
into
further
trouble
by
disquieting
to
no
purpose
my
already
enfeebled
and
agitated
mind
in
vain
i
revolved
in
my
brain
a
multitude
of
absurd
expedients
for
procuring
light--such
expedients
precisely
as
a
man
in
the
perturbed
sleep
occasioned
by
opium
would
be
apt
to
fall
upon
for
a
similar
purpose--each
and
all
of
which
appear
by
turns
to
the
dreamer
the
most
reasonable
and
the
most
preposterous
of
conceptions
just
as
the
reasoning
or
imaginative
faculties
flicker
alternately
one
above
the
other
at
last
an
idea
occurred
to
me
which
seemed
rational
and
which
gave
me
cause
to
wonder
very
justly
that
i
had
not
entertained
it
before
i
placed
the
slip
of
paper
on
the
back
of
a
book
and
collecting
the
fragments
of
the
phosphorus
matches
which
i
had
brought
from
the
barrel
laid
them
together
upon
the
paper
i
then
with
the
palm
of
my
hand
rubbed
the
whole
over
quickly
yet
steadily
a
clear
light
diffused
itself
immediately
throughout
the
whole
surface
and
had
there
been
any
writing
upon
it
i
should
not
have
experienced
the
least
difficulty
i
am
sure
in
reading
it
not
a
syllable
was
there
however--nothing
but
a
dreary
and
unsatisfactory
blank
the
illumination
died
away
in
a
few
seconds
and
my
heart
died
away
within
me
as
it
went
i
have
before
stated
more
than
once
that
my
intellect
for
some
period
prior
to
this
had
been
in
a
condition
nearly
bordering
on
idiocy
there
were
to
be
sure
momentary
intervals
of
perfect
sanity
and
now
and
then
even
of
energy
but
these
were
few
it
must
be
remembered
that
i
had
been
for
many
days
certainly
inhaling
the
almost
pestilential
atmosphere
of
a
close
hold
in
a
whaling
vessel
and
for
a
long
portion
of
that
time
but
scantily
supplied
with
water
for
the
last
fourteen
or
fifteen
hours
i
had
none--nor
had
i
slept
during
that
time
salt
provisions
of
the
most
exciting
kind
had
been
my
chief
and
indeed
since
the
loss
of
the
mutton
my
only
supply
of
food
with
the
exception
of
the
sea-biscuit
and
these
latter
were
utterly
useless
to
me
as
they
were
too
dry
and
hard
to
be
swallowed
in
the
swollen
and
parched
condition
of
my
throat
i
was
now
in
a
high
state
of
fever
and
in
every
respect
exceedingly
ill
this
will
account
for
the
fact
that
many
miserable
hours
of
despondency
elapsed
after
my
last
adventure
with
the
phosphorus
before
the
thought
suggested
itself
that
i
had
examined
only
one
side
of
the
paper
i
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
my
feelings
of
rage
for
i
believe
i
was
more
angry
than
any
thing
else
when
the
egregious
oversight
i
had
committed
flashed
suddenly
upon
my
perception
the
blunder
itself
would
have
been
unimportant
had
not
my
own
folly
and
impetuosity
rendered
it
otherwise--in
my
disappointment
at
not
finding
some
words
upon
the
slip
i
had
childishly
torn
it
in
pieces
and
thrown
it
away
it
was
impossible
to
say
where
from
the
worst
part
of
this
dilemma
i
was
relieved
by
the
sagacity
of
tiger
having
got
after
a
long
search
a
small
piece
of
the
note
i
put
it
to
the
dogâ€™s
nose
and
endeavored
to
make
him
understand
that
he
must
bring
me
the
rest
of
it
to
my
astonishment
for
i
had
taught
him
none
of
the
usual
tricks
for
which
his
breed
are
famous
he
seemed
to
enter
at
once
into
my
meaning
and
rummaging
about
for
a
few
moments
soon
found
another
considerable
portion
bringing
me
this
he
paused
awhile
and
rubbing
his
nose
against
my
hand
appeared
to
be
waiting
for
my
approval
of
what
he
had
done
i
patted
him
on
the
head
when
he
immediately
made
off
again
it
was
now
some
minutes
before
he
came
back--but
when
he
did
come
he
brought
with
him
a
large
slip
which
proved
to
be
all
the
paper
missing--it
having
been
torn
it
seems
only
into
three
pieces
luckily
i
had
no
trouble
in
finding
what
few
fragments
of
the
phosphorus
were
left--being
guided
by
the
indistinct
glow
one
or
two
of
the
particles
still
emitted
my
difficulties
had
taught
me
the
necessity
of
caution
and
i
now
took
time
to
reflect
upon
what
i
was
about
to
do
it
was
very
probable
i
considered
that
some
words
were
written
upon
that
side
of
the
paper
which
had
not
been
examined--but
which
side
was
that
fitting
the
pieces
together
gave
me
no
clew
in
this
respect
although
it
assured
me
that
the
words
if
there
were
any
would
be
found
all
on
one
side
and
connected
in
a
proper
manner
as
written
there
was
the
greater
necessity
of
ascertaining
the
point
in
question
beyond
a
doubt
as
the
phosphorus
remaining
would
be
altogether
insufficient
for
a
third
attempt
should
i
fail
in
the
one
i
was
now
about
to
make
i
placed
the
paper
on
a
book
as
before
and
sat
for
some
minutes
thoughtfully
revolving
the
matter
over
in
my
mind
at
last
i
thought
it
barely
possible
that
the
written
side
might
have
some
unevenness
on
its
surface
which
a
delicate
sense
of
feeling
might
enable
me
to
detect
i
determined
to
make
the
experiment
and
passed
my
finger
very
carefully
over
the
side
which
first
presented
itself
nothing
however
was
perceptible
and
i
turned
the
paper
adjusting
it
on
the
book
i
now
again
carried
my
forefinger
cautiously
along
when
i
was
aware
of
an
exceedingly
slight
but
still
discernable
glow
which
followed
as
it
proceeded
this
i
knew
must
arise
from
some
very
minute
remaining
particles
of
the
phosphorus
with
which
i
had
covered
the
paper
in
my
previous
attempt
the
other
or
under
side
then
was
that
on
which
lay
the
writing
if
writing
there
should
finally
prove
to
be
again
i
turned
the
note
and
went
to
work
as
i
had
previously
done
having
rubbed
in
the
phosphorus
a
brilliancy
ensued
as
before--but
this
time
several
lines
of
ms
in
a
large
hand
and
apparently
in
red
ink
became
distinctly
visible
the
glimmer
although
sufficiently
bright
was
but
momentary
still
had
i
not
been
too
greatly
excited
there
would
have
been
ample
time
enough
for
me
to
peruse
the
whole
three
sentences
before
me--for
i
saw
there
were
three
in
my
anxiety
however
to
read
all
at
once
i
succeeded
only
in
reading
the
seven
concluding
words
which
thus
appeared--â€œblood--your
life
depends
upon
lying
closeâ€
had
i
been
able
to
ascertain
the
entire
contents
of
the
note--the
full
meaning
of
the
admonition
which
my
friend
had
thus
attempted
to
convey
that
admonition
even
although
it
should
have
revealed
a
story
of
disaster
the
most
unspeakable
could
not
i
am
firmly
convinced
have
imbued
my
mind
with
one
tithe
of
the
harrowing
and
yet
indefinable
horror
with
which
i
was
inspired
by
the
fragmentary
warning
thus
received
and
â€œbloodâ€
too
that
word
of
all
words--so
rife
at
all
times
with
mystery
and
suffering
and
terror--how
trebly
full
of
import
did
it
now
appear--how
chilly
and
heavily
disjointed
as
it
thus
was
from
any
foregoing
words
to
qualify
or
render
it
distinct
did
its
vague
syllables
fall
amid
the
deep
gloom
of
my
prison
into
the
innermost
recesses
of
my
soul
augustus
had
undoubtedly
good
reasons
for
wishing
me
to
remain
concealed
and
i
formed
a
thousand
surmises
as
to
what
they
could
be--but
i
could
think
of
nothing
affording
a
satisfactory
solution
of
the
mystery
just
after
returning
from
my
last
journey
to
the
trap
and
before
my
attention
had
been
otherwise
directed
by
the
singular
conduct
of
tiger
i
had
come
to
the
resolution
of
making
myself
heard
at
all
events
by
those
on
board
or
if
i
could
not
succeed
in
this
directly
of
trying
to
cut
my
way
through
the
orlop
deck
the
half
certainty
which
i
felt
of
being
able
to
accomplish
one
of
these
two
purposes
in
the
last
emergency
had
given
me
courage
which
i
should
not
otherwise
have
had
to
endure
the
evils
of
my
situation
the
few
words
i
had
been
able
to
read
however
had
cut
me
off
from
these
final
resources
and
i
now
for
the
first
time
felt
all
the
misery
of
my
fate
in
a
paroxysm
of
despair
i
threw
myself
again
upon
the
mattress
where
for
about
the
period
of
a
day
and
night
i
lay
in
a
kind
of
stupor
relieved
only
by
momentary
intervals
of
reason
and
recollection
at
length
i
once
more
arose
and
busied
myself
in
reflection
upon
the
horrors
which
encompassed
me
for
another
twenty-four
hours
it
was
barely
possible
that
i
might
exist
without
water--for
a
longer
time
i
could
not
do
so
during
the
first
portion
of
my
imprisonment
i
had
made
free
use
of
the
cordials
with
which
augustus
had
supplied
me
but
they
only
served
to
excite
fever
without
in
the
least
degree
assuaging
thirst
i
had
now
only
about
a
gill
left
and
this
was
of
a
species
of
strong
peach
liqueur
at
which
my
stomach
revolted
the
sausages
were
entirely
consumed
of
the
ham
nothing
remained
but
a
small
piece
of
the
skin
and
all
the
biscuit
except
a
few
fragments
of
one
had
been
eaten
by
tiger
to
add
to
my
troubles
i
found
that
my
headache
was
increasing
momentarily
and
with
it
the
species
of
delirium
which
had
distressed
me
more
or
less
since
my
first
falling
asleep
for
some
hours
past
it
had
been
with
the
greatest
difficulty
i
could
breathe
at
all
and
now
each
attempt
at
so
doing
was
attended
with
the
most
depressing
spasmodic
action
of
the
chest
but
there
was
still
another
and
very
different
source
of
disquietude
and
one
indeed
whose
harassing
terrors
had
been
the
chief
means
of
arousing
me
to
exertion
from
my
stupor
on
the
mattress
it
arose
from
the
demeanor
of
the
dog
i
first
observed
an
alteration
in
his
conduct
while
rubbing
in
the
phosphorus
on
the
paper
in
my
last
attempt
as
i
rubbed
he
ran
his
nose
against
my
hand
with
a
slight
snarl
but
i
was
too
greatly
excited
at
the
time
to
pay
much
attention
to
the
circumstance
soon
afterward
it
will
be
remembered
i
threw
myself
on
the
mattress
and
fell
into
a
species
of
lethargy
presently
i
became
aware
of
a
singular
hissing
sound
close
at
my
ears
and
discovered
it
to
proceed
from
tiger
who
was
panting
and
wheezing
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
apparent
excitement
his
eyeballs
flashing
fiercely
through
the
gloom
i
spoke
to
him
when
he
replied
with
a
low
growl
and
then
remained
quiet
presently
i
relapsed
into
my
stupor
from
which
i
was
again
awakened
in
a
similar
manner
this
was
repeated
three
or
four
times
until
finally
his
behaviour
inspired
me
with
so
great
a
degree
of
fear
that
i
became
fully
aroused
he
was
now
lying
close
by
the
door
of
the
box
snarling
fearfully
although
in
a
kind
of
undertone
and
grinding
his
teeth
as
if
strongly
convulsed
i
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
want
of
water
or
the
confined
atmosphere
of
the
hold
had
driven
him
mad
and
i
was
at
a
loss
what
course
to
pursue
i
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
killing
him
yet
it
seemed
absolutely
necessary
for
my
own
safety
i
could
distinctly
perceive
his
eyes
fastened
upon
me
with
an
expression
of
the
most
deadly
animosity
and
i
expected
every
instant
that
he
would
attack
me
at
last
i
could
endure
my
terrible
situation
no
longer
and
determined
to
make
my
way
from
the
box
at
all
hazards
and
dispatch
him
if
his
opposition
should
render
it
necessary
for
me
to
do
so
to
get
out
i
had
to
pass
directly
over
his
body
and
he
already
seemed
to
anticipate
my
design--missing
himself
upon
his
fore-legs
as
i
perceived
by
the
altered
position
of
his
eyes
and
displayed
the
whole
of
his
white
fangs
which
were
easily
discernible
i
took
the
remains
of
the
ham-skin
and
the
bottle
containing
the
liqueur
and
secured
them
about
my
person
together
with
a
large
carving-knife
which
augustus
had
left
me--then
folding
my
cloak
around
me
as
closely
as
possible
i
made
a
movement
toward
the
mouth
of
the
box
no
sooner
did
i
do
this
than
the
dog
sprang
with
a
loud
growl
toward
my
throat
the
whole
weight
of
his
body
struck
me
on
the
right
shoulder
and
i
fell
violently
to
the
left
while
the
enraged
animal
passed
entirely
over
me
i
had
fallen
upon
my
knees
with
my
head
buried
among
the
blankets
and
these
protected
me
from
a
second
furious
assault
during
which
i
felt
the
sharp
teeth
pressing
vigorously
upon
the
woollen
which
enveloped
my
neck--yet
luckily
without
being
able
to
penetrate
all
the
folds
i
was
now
beneath
the
dog
and
a
few
moments
would
place
me
completely
in
his
power
despair
gave
me
strength
and
i
rose
boldly
up
shaking
him
from
me
by
main
force
and
dragging
with
me
the
blankets
from
the
mattress
these
i
now
threw
over
him
and
before
he
could
extricate
himself
i
had
got
through
the
door
and
closed
it
effectually
against
his
pursuit
in
this
struggle
however
i
had
been
forced
to
drop
the
morsel
of
ham-skin
and
i
now
found
my
whole
stock
of
provisions
reduced
to
a
single
gill
of
liqueur
as
this
reflection
crossed
my
mind
i
felt
myself
actuated
by
one
of
those
fits
of
perverseness
which
might
be
supposed
to
influence
a
spoiled
child
in
similar
circumstances
and
raising
the
bottle
to
my
lips
i
drained
it
to
the
last
drop
and
dashed
it
furiously
upon
the
floor
scarcely
had
the
echo
of
the
crash
died
away
when
i
heard
my
name
pronounced
in
an
eager
but
subdued
voice
issuing
from
the
direction
of
the
steerage
so
unexpected
was
anything
of
the
kind
and
so
intense
was
the
emotion
excited
within
me
by
the
sound
that
i
endeavoured
in
vain
to
reply
my
powers
of
speech
totally
failed
and
in
an
agony
of
terror
lest
my
friend
should
conclude
me
dead
and
return
without
attempting
to
reach
me
i
stood
up
between
the
crates
near
the
door
of
the
box
trembling
convulsively
and
gasping
and
struggling
for
utterance
had
a
thousand
words
depended
upon
a
syllable
i
could
not
have
spoken
it
there
was
a
slight
movement
now
audible
among
the
lumber
somewhere
forward
of
my
station
the
sound
presently
grew
less
distinct
then
again
less
so
and
still
less
shall
i
ever
forget
my
feelings
at
this
moment
he
was
going--my
friend
my
companion
from
whom
i
had
a
right
to
expect
so
much--he
was
going--he
would
abandon
me--he
was
gone
he
would
leave
me
to
perish
miserably
to
expire
in
the
most
horrible
and
loathesome
of
dungeons--and
one
word
one
little
syllable
would
save
me--yet
that
single
syllable
i
could
not
utter
i
felt
i
am
sure
more
than
ten
thousand
times
the
agonies
of
death
itself
my
brain
reeled
and
i
fell
deadly
sick
against
the
end
of
the
box
as
i
fell
the
carving-knife
was
shaken
out
from
the
waist-band
of
my
pantaloons
and
dropped
with
a
rattling
sound
to
the
floor
never
did
any
strain
of
the
richest
melody
come
so
sweetly
to
my
ears
with
the
intensest
anxiety
i
listened
to
ascertain
the
effect
of
the
noise
upon
augustus--for
i
knew
that
the
person
who
called
my
name
could
be
no
one
but
himself
all
was
silent
for
some
moments
at
length
i
again
heard
the
word
â€œarthurâ€
repeated
in
a
low
tone
and
one
full
of
hesitation
reviving
hope
loosened
at
once
my
powers
of
speech
and
i
now
screamed
at
the
top
of
my
voice
â€œaugustus
oh
augustusâ€
â€œhush
for
godâ€™s
sake
be
silentâ€
he
replied
in
a
voice
trembling
with
agitation
â€œi
will
be
with
you
immediately--as
soon
as
i
can
make
my
way
through
the
holdâ€
for
a
long
time
i
heard
him
moving
among
the
lumber
and
every
moment
seemed
to
me
an
age
at
length
i
felt
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
and
he
placed
at
the
same
moment
a
bottle
of
water
to
my
lips
those
only
who
have
been
suddenly
redeemed
from
the
jaws
of
the
tomb
or
who
have
known
the
insufferable
torments
of
thirst
under
circumstances
as
aggravated
as
those
which
encompassed
me
in
my
dreary
prison
can
form
any
idea
of
the
unutterable
transports
which
that
one
long
draught
of
the
richest
of
all
physical
luxuries
afforded
when
i
had
in
some
degree
satisfied
my
thirst
augustus
produced
from
his
pocket
three
or
four
boiled
potatoes
which
i
devoured
with
the
greatest
avidity
he
had
brought
with
him
a
light
in
a
dark
lantern
and
the
grateful
rays
afforded
me
scarcely
less
comfort
than
the
food
and
drink
but
i
was
impatient
to
learn
the
cause
of
his
protracted
absence
and
he
proceeded
to
recount
what
had
happened
on
board
during
my
incarceration
the
brig
put
to
sea
as
i
had
supposed
in
about
an
hour
after
he
had
left
the
watch
this
was
on
the
twentieth
of
june
it
will
be
remembered
that
i
had
then
been
in
the
hold
for
three
days
and
during
this
period
there
was
so
constant
a
bustle
on
board
and
so
much
running
to
and
fro
especially
in
the
cabin
and
staterooms
that
he
had
had
no
chance
of
visiting
me
without
the
risk
of
having
the
secret
of
the
trap
discovered
when
at
length
he
did
come
i
had
assured
him
that
i
was
doing
as
well
as
possible
and
therefore
for
the
two
next
days
he
felt
but
little
uneasiness
on
my
account--still
however
watching
an
opportunity
of
going
down
it
was
not
until
the
fourth
day
that
he
found
one
several
times
during
this
interval
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
let
his
father
know
of
the
adventure
and
have
me
come
up
at
once
but
we
were
still
within
reaching
distance
of
nantucket
and
it
was
doubtful
from
some
expressions
which
had
escaped
captain
barnard
whether
he
would
not
immediately
put
back
if
he
discovered
me
to
be
on
board
besides
upon
thinking
the
matter
over
augustus
so
he
told
me
could
not
imagine
that
i
was
in
immediate
want
or
that
i
would
hesitate
in
such
case
to
make
myself
heard
at
the
trap
when
therefore
he
considered
everything
he
concluded
to
let
me
stay
until
he
could
meet
with
an
opportunity
of
visiting
me
unobserved
this
as
i
said
before
did
not
occur
until
the
fourth
day
after
his
bringing
me
the
watch
and
the
seventh
since
i
had
first
entered
the
hold
he
then
went
down
without
taking
with
him
any
water
or
provisions
intending
in
the
first
place
merely
to
call
my
attention
and
get
me
to
come
from
the
box
to
the
trap--when
he
would
go
up
to
the
stateroom
and
thence
hand
me
down
a
supply
when
he
descended
for
this
purpose
he
found
that
i
was
asleep
for
it
seems
that
i
was
snoring
very
loudly
from
all
the
calculations
i
can
make
on
the
subject
this
must
have
been
the
slumber
into
which
i
fell
just
after
my
return
from
the
trap
with
the
watch
and
which
consequently
must
have
lasted
for
more
than
three
entire
days
and
nights
at
the
very
least
latterly
i
have
had
reason
both
from
my
own
experience
and
the
assurance
of
others
to
be
acquainted
with
the
strong
soporific
effects
of
the
stench
arising
from
old
fish-oil
when
closely
confined
and
when
i
think
of
the
condition
of
the
hold
in
which
i
was
imprisoned
and
the
long
period
during
which
the
brig
had
been
used
as
a
whaling
vessel
i
am
more
inclined
to
wonder
that
i
awoke
at
all
after
once
falling
asleep
than
that
i
should
have
slept
uninterruptedly
for
the
period
specified
above
augustus
called
to
me
at
first
in
a
low
voice
and
without
closing
the
trap--but
i
made
him
no
reply
he
then
shut
the
trap
and
spoke
to
me
in
a
louder
and
finally
in
a
very
loud
tone--still
i
continued
to
snore
he
was
now
at
a
loss
what
to
do
it
would
take
him
some
time
to
make
his
way
through
the
lumber
to
my
box
and
in
the
meanwhile
his
absence
would
be
noticed
by
captain
barnard
who
had
occasion
for
his
services
every
minute
in
arranging
and
copying
papers
connected
with
the
business
of
the
voyage
he
determined
therefore
upon
reflection
to
ascend
and
await
another
opportunity
of
visiting
me
he
was
the
more
easily
induced
to
this
resolve
as
my
slumber
appeared
to
be
of
the
most
tranquil
nature
and
he
could
not
suppose
that
i
had
undergone
any
inconvenience
from
my
incarceration
he
had
just
made
up
his
mind
on
these
points
when
his
attention
was
arrested
by
an
unusual
bustle
the
sound
of
which
proceeded
apparently
from
the
cabin
he
sprang
through
the
trap
as
quickly
as
possible
closed
it
and
threw
open
the
door
of
his
stateroom
no
sooner
had
he
put
his
foot
over
the
threshold
than
a
pistol
flashed
in
his
face
and
he
was
knocked
down
at
the
same
moment
by
a
blow
from
a
handspike
a
strong
hand
held
him
on
the
cabin
floor
with
a
tight
grasp
upon
his
throat
still
he
was
able
to
see
what
was
going
on
around
him
his
father
was
tied
hand
and
foot
and
lying
along
the
steps
of
the
companion-way
with
his
head
down
and
a
deep
wound
in
the
forehead
from
which
the
blood
was
flowing
in
a
continued
stream
he
spoke
not
a
word
and
was
apparently
dying
over
him
stood
the
first
mate
eyeing
him
with
an
expression
of
fiendish
derision
and
deliberately
searching
his
pockets
from
which
he
presently
drew
forth
a
large
wallet
and
a
chronometer
seven
of
the
crew
among
whom
was
the
cook
a
negro
were
rummaging
the
staterooms
on
the
larboard
for
arms
where
they
soon
equipped
themselves
with
muskets
and
ammunition
besides
augustus
and
captain
barnard
there
were
nine
men
altogether
in
the
cabin
and
these
among
the
most
ruffianly
of
the
brigâ€™s
company
the
villains
now
went
upon
deck
taking
my
friend
with
them
after
having
secured
his
arms
behind
his
back
they
proceeded
straight
to
the
forecastle
which
was
fastened
down--two
of
the
mutineers
standing
by
it
with
axes--two
also
at
the
main
hatch
the
mate
called
out
in
a
loud
voice
â€œdo
you
hear
there
below
tumble
up
with
you
one
by
one--now
mark
that--and
no
grumblingâ€
it
was
some
minutes
before
any
one
appeared--at
last
an
englishman
who
had
shipped
as
a
raw
hand
came
up
weeping
piteously
and
entreating
the
mate
in
the
most
humble
manner
to
spare
his
life
the
only
reply
was
a
blow
on
the
forehead
from
an
axe
the
poor
fellow
fell
to
the
deck
without
a
groan
and
the
black
cook
lifted
him
up
in
his
arms
as
he
would
a
child
and
tossed
him
deliberately
into
the
sea
hearing
the
blow
and
the
plunge
of
the
body
the
men
below
could
now
be
induced
to
venture
on
deck
neither
by
threats
nor
promises
until
a
proposition
was
made
to
smoke
them
out
a
general
rush
then
ensued
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
possible
that
the
brig
might
be
retaken
the
mutineers
however
succeeded
at
last
in
closing
the
forecastle
effectually
before
more
than
six
of
their
opponents
could
get
up
these
six
finding
themselves
so
greatly
outnumbered
and
without
arms
submitted
after
a
brief
struggle
the
mate
gave
them
fair
words--no
doubt
with
a
view
of
inducing
those
below
to
yield
for
they
had
no
difficulty
in
hearing
all
that
was
said
on
deck
the
result
proved
his
sagacity
no
less
than
his
diabolical
villainy
all
in
the
forecastle
presently
signified
their
intention
of
submitting
and
ascending
one
by
one
were
pinioned
and
then
thrown
on
their
backs
together
with
the
first
six--there
being
in
all
of
the
crew
who
were
not
concerned
in
the
mutiny
twenty-seven
a
scene
of
the
most
horrible
butchery
ensued
the
bound
seamen
were
dragged
to
the
gangway
here
the
cook
stood
with
an
axe
striking
each
victim
on
the
head
as
he
was
forced
over
the
side
of
the
vessel
by
the
other
mutineers
in
this
manner
twenty-two
perished
and
augustus
had
given
himself
up
for
lost
expecting
every
moment
his
own
turn
to
come
next
but
it
seemed
that
the
villains
were
now
either
weary
or
in
some
measure
disgusted
with
their
bloody
labour
for
the
four
remaining
prisoners
together
with
my
friend
who
had
been
thrown
on
the
deck
with
the
rest
were
respited
while
the
mate
sent
below
for
rum
and
the
whole
murderous
party
held
a
drunken
carouse
which
lasted
until
sunset
they
now
fell
to
disputing
in
regard
to
the
fate
of
the
survivors
who
lay
not
more
than
four
paces
off
and
could
distinguish
every
word
said
upon
some
of
the
mutineers
the
liquor
appeared
to
have
a
softening
effect
for
several
voices
were
heard
in
favor
of
releasing
the
captives
altogether
on
condition
of
joining
the
mutiny
and
sharing
the
profits
the
black
cook
however
who
in
all
respects
was
a
perfect
demon
and
who
seemed
to
exert
as
much
influence
if
not
more
than
the
mate
himself
would
listen
to
no
proposition
of
the
kind
and
rose
repeatedly
for
the
purpose
of
resuming
his
work
at
the
gangway
fortunately
he
was
so
far
overcome
by
intoxication
as
to
be
easily
restrained
by
the
less
bloodthirsty
of
the
party
among
whom
was
a
line-manager
who
went
by
the
name
of
dirk
peters
this
man
was
the
son
of
an
indian
squaw
of
the
tribe
of
upsarokas
who
live
among
the
fastnesses
of
the
black
hills
near
the
source
of
the
missouri
his
father
was
a
fur-trader
i
believe
or
at
least
connected
in
some
manner
with
the
indian
trading-posts
on
lewis
river
peters
himself
was
one
of
the
most
ferocious-looking
men
i
ever
beheld
he
was
short
in
stature
not
more
than
four
feet
eight
inches
high
but
his
limbs
were
of
herculean
mould
his
hands
especially
were
so
enormously
thick
and
broad
as
hardly
to
retain
a
human
shape
his
arms
as
well
as
legs
were
bowed
in
the
most
singular
manner
and
appeared
to
possess
no
flexibility
whatever
his
head
was
equally
deformed
being
of
immense
size
with
an
indentation
on
the
crown
like
that
on
the
head
of
most
negroes
and
entirely
bald
to
conceal
this
latter
deficiency
which
did
not
proceed
from
old
age
he
usually
wore
a
wig
formed
of
any
hair-like
material
which
presented
itself--occasionally
the
skin
of
a
spanish
dog
or
american
grizzly
bear
at
the
time
spoken
of
he
had
on
a
portion
of
one
of
these
bearskins
and
it
added
no
little
to
the
natural
ferocity
of
his
countenance
which
betook
of
the
upsaroka
character
the
mouth
extended
nearly
from
ear
to
ear
the
lips
were
thin
and
seemed
like
some
other
portions
of
his
frame
to
be
devoid
of
natural
pliancy
so
that
the
ruling
expression
never
varied
under
the
influence
of
any
emotion
whatever
this
ruling
expression
may
be
conceived
when
it
is
considered
that
the
teeth
were
exceedingly
long
and
protruding
and
never
even
partially
covered
in
any
instance
by
the
lips
to
pass
this
man
with
a
casual
glance
one
might
imagine
him
to
be
convulsed
with
laughter
but
a
second
look
would
induce
a
shuddering
acknowledgment
that
if
such
an
expression
were
indicative
of
merriment
the
merriment
must
be
that
of
a
demon
of
this
singular
being
many
anecdotes
were
prevalent
among
the
seafaring
men
of
nantucket
these
anecdotes
went
to
prove
his
prodigious
strength
when
under
excitement
and
some
of
them
had
given
rise
to
a
doubt
of
his
sanity
but
on
board
the
grampus
it
seems
he
was
regarded
at
the
time
of
the
mutiny
with
feelings
more
of
derision
than
of
anything
else
i
have
been
thus
particular
in
speaking
of
dirk
peters
because
ferocious
as
he
appeared
he
proved
the
main
instrument
in
preserving
the
life
of
augustus
and
because
i
shall
have
frequent
occasion
to
mention
him
hereafter
in
the
course
of
my
narrative--a
narrative
let
me
here
say
which
in
its
latter
portions
will
be
found
to
include
incidents
of
a
nature
so
entirely
out
of
the
range
of
human
experience
and
for
this
reason
so
far
beyond
the
limits
of
human
credulity
that
i
proceed
in
utter
hopelessness
of
obtaining
credence
for
all
that
i
shall
tell
yet
confidently
trusting
in
time
and
progressing
science
to
verify
some
of
the
most
important
and
most
improbable
of
my
statements
after
much
indecision
and
two
or
three
violent
quarrels
it
was
determined
at
last
that
all
the
prisoners
with
the
exception
of
augustus
whom
peters
insisted
in
a
jocular
manner
upon
keeping
as
his
clerk
should
be
set
adrift
in
one
of
the
smallest
whaleboats
the
mate
went
down
into
the
cabin
to
see
if
captain
barnard
was
still
living--for
it
will
be
remembered
he
was
left
below
when
the
mutineers
came
up
presently
the
two
made
their
appearance
the
captain
pale
as
death
but
somewhat
recovered
from
the
effects
of
his
wound
he
spoke
to
the
men
in
a
voice
hardly
articulate
entreated
them
not
to
set
him
adrift
but
to
return
to
their
duty
and
promising
to
land
them
wherever
they
chose
and
to
take
no
steps
for
bringing
them
to
justice
he
might
as
well
have
spoken
to
the
winds
two
of
the
ruffians
seized
him
by
the
arms
and
hurled
him
over
the
brigâ€™s
side
into
the
boat
which
had
been
lowered
while
the
mate
went
below
the
four
men
who
were
lying
on
the
deck
were
then
untied
and
ordered
to
follow
which
they
did
without
attempting
any
resistance--augustus
being
still
left
in
his
painful
position
although
he
struggled
and
prayed
only
for
the
poor
satisfaction
of
being
permitted
to
bid
his
father
farewell
a
handful
of
sea-biscuit
and
a
jug
of
water
were
now
handed
down
but
neither
mast
sail
oar
nor
compass
the
boat
was
towed
astern
for
a
few
minutes
during
which
the
mutineers
held
another
consultation--it
was
then
finally
cut
adrift
by
this
time
night
had
come
on--there
were
neither
moon
nor
stars
visible--and
a
short
and
ugly
sea
was
running
although
there
was
no
great
deal
of
wind
the
boat
was
instantly
out
of
sight
and
little
hope
could
be
entertained
for
the
unfortunate
sufferers
who
were
in
it
this
event
happened
however
in
latitude
35
degrees
30â€™
north
longitude
61
degrees
20â€™
west
and
consequently
at
no
very
great
distance
from
the
bermuda
islands
augustus
therefore
endeavored
to
console
himself
with
the
idea
that
the
boat
might
either
succeed
in
reaching
the
land
or
come
sufficiently
near
to
be
fallen
in
with
by
vessels
off
the
coast
all
sail
was
now
put
upon
the
brig
and
she
continued
her
original
course
to
the
southwest--the
mutineers
being
bent
upon
some
piratical
expedition
in
which
from
all
that
could
be
understood
a
ship
was
to
be
intercepted
on
her
way
from
the
cape
verd
islands
to
porto
rico
no
attention
was
paid
to
augustus
who
was
untied
and
suffered
to
go
about
anywhere
forward
of
the
cabin
companion-way
dirk
peters
treated
him
with
some
degree
of
kindness
and
on
one
occasion
saved
him
from
the
brutality
of
the
cook
his
situation
was
still
one
of
the
most
precarious
as
the
men
were
continually
intoxicated
and
there
was
no
relying
upon
their
continued
good-humor
or
carelessness
in
regard
to
himself
his
anxiety
on
my
account
he
represented
however
as
the
most
distressing
result
of
his
condition
and
indeed
i
had
never
reason
to
doubt
the
sincerity
of
his
friendship
more
than
once
he
had
resolved
to
acquaint
the
mutineers
with
the
secret
of
my
being
on
board
but
was
restrained
from
so
doing
partly
through
recollection
of
the
atrocities
he
had
already
beheld
and
partly
through
a
hope
of
being
able
soon
to
bring
me
relief
for
the
latter
purpose
he
was
constantly
on
the
watch
but
in
spite
of
the
most
constant
vigilance
three
days
elapsed
after
the
boat
was
cut
adrift
before
any
chance
occurred
at
length
on
the
night
of
the
third
day
there
came
on
a
heavy
blow
from
the
eastward
and
all
hands
were
called
up
to
take
in
sail
during
the
confusion
which
ensued
he
made
his
way
below
unobserved
and
into
the
stateroom
what
was
his
grief
and
horror
in
discovering
that
the
latter
had
been
rendered
a
place
of
deposit
for
a
variety
of
sea-stores
and
ship-furniture
and
that
several
fathoms
of
old
chain-cable
which
had
been
stowed
away
beneath
the
companion-ladder
had
been
dragged
thence
to
make
room
for
a
chest
and
were
now
lying
immediately
upon
the
trap
to
remove
it
without
discovery
was
impossible
and
he
returned
on
deck
as
quickly
as
he
could
as
he
came
up
the
mate
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
demanding
what
he
had
been
doing
in
the
cabin
was
about
flinging
him
over
the
larboard
bulwark
when
his
life
was
again
preserved
through
the
interference
of
dirk
peters
augustus
was
now
put
in
handcuffs
of
which
there
were
several
pairs
on
board
and
his
feet
lashed
tightly
together
he
was
then
taken
into
the
steerage
and
thrown
into
a
lower
berth
next
to
the
forecastle
bulkheads
with
the
assurance
that
he
should
never
put
his
foot
on
deck
again
â€œuntil
the
brig
was
no
longer
a
brigâ€
this
was
the
expression
of
the
cook
who
threw
him
into
the
berth--it
is
hardly
possible
to
say
what
precise
meaning
intended
by
the
phrase
the
whole
affair
however
proved
the
ultimate
means
of
my
relief
as
will
presently
appear
for
some
minutes
after
the
cook
had
left
the
forecastle
augustus
abandoned
himself
to
despair
never
hoping
to
leave
the
berth
alive
he
now
came
to
the
resolution
of
acquainting
the
first
of
the
men
who
should
come
down
with
my
situation
thinking
it
better
to
let
me
take
my
chance
with
the
mutineers
than
perish
of
thirst
in
the
hold--for
it
had
been
ten
days
since
i
was
first
imprisoned
and
my
jug
of
water
was
not
a
plentiful
supply
even
for
four
as
he
was
thinking
on
this
subject
the
idea
came
all
at
once
into
his
head
that
it
might
be
possible
to
communicate
with
me
by
the
way
of
the
main
hold
in
any
other
circumstances
the
difficulty
and
hazard
of
the
undertaking
would
have
prevented
him
from
attempting
it
but
now
he
had
at
all
events
little
prospect
of
life
and
consequently
little
to
lose
he
bent
his
whole
mind
therefore
upon
the
task
his
handcuffs
were
the
first
consideration
at
first
he
saw
no
method
of
removing
them
and
feared
that
he
should
thus
be
baffled
in
the
very
outset
but
upon
a
closer
scrutiny
he
discovered
that
the
irons
could
be
slipped
off
and
on
at
pleasure
with
very
little
effort
or
inconvenience
merely
by
squeezing
his
hands
through
them--this
species
of
manacle
being
altogether
ineffectual
in
confining
young
persons
in
whom
the
smaller
bones
readily
yield
to
pressure
he
now
untied
his
feet
and
leaving
the
cord
in
such
a
manner
that
it
could
easily
be
readjusted
in
the
event
of
any
personâ€™s
coming
down
proceeded
to
examine
the
bulkhead
where
it
joined
the
berth
the
partition
here
was
of
soft
pine
board
an
inch
thick
and
he
saw
that
he
should
have
little
trouble
in
cutting
his
way
through
a
voice
was
now
heard
at
the
forecastle
companion-way
and
he
had
just
time
to
put
his
right
hand
into
its
handcuff
the
left
had
not
been
removed
and
to
draw
the
rope
in
a
slipknot
around
his
ankle
when
dirk
peters
came
below
followed
by
tiger
who
immediately
leaped
into
the
berth
and
lay
down
the
dog
had
been
brought
on
board
by
augustus
who
knew
my
attachment
to
the
animal
and
thought
it
would
give
me
pleasure
to
have
him
with
me
during
the
voyage
he
went
up
to
our
house
for
him
immediately
after
first
taking
me
into
the
hold
but
did
not
think
of
mentioning
the
circumstance
upon
his
bringing
the
watch
since
the
mutiny
augustus
had
not
seen
him
before
his
appearance
with
dirk
peters
and
had
given
him
up
for
lost
supposing
him
to
have
been
thrown
overboard
by
some
of
the
malignant
villains
belonging
to
the
mateâ€™s
gang
it
appeared
afterward
that
he
had
crawled
into
a
hole
beneath
a
whale-boat
from
which
not
having
room
to
turn
round
he
could
not
extricate
himself
peters
at
last
let
him
out
and
with
a
species
of
good
feeling
which
my
friend
knew
well
how
to
appreciate
had
now
brought
him
to
him
in
the
forecastle
as
a
companion
leaving
at
the
same
time
some
salt
junk
and
potatoes
with
a
can
of
water
he
then
went
on
deck
promising
to
come
down
with
something
more
to
eat
on
the
next
day
when
he
had
gone
augustus
freed
both
hands
from
the
manacles
and
unfastened
his
feet
he
then
turned
down
the
head
of
the
mattress
on
which
he
had
been
lying
and
with
his
penknife
for
the
ruffians
had
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
search
him
commenced
cutting
vigorously
across
one
of
the
partition
planks
as
closely
as
possible
to
the
floor
of
the
berth
he
chose
to
cut
here
because
if
suddenly
interrupted
he
would
be
able
to
conceal
what
had
been
done
by
letting
the
head
of
the
mattress
fall
into
its
proper
position
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
however
no
disturbance
occurred
and
by
night
he
had
completely
divided
the
plank
it
should
here
be
observed
that
none
of
the
crew
occupied
the
forecastle
as
a
sleeping-place
living
altogether
in
the
cabin
since
the
mutiny
drinking
the
wines
and
feasting
on
the
sea-stores
of
captain
barnard
and
giving
no
more
heed
than
was
absolutely
necessary
to
the
navigation
of
the
brig
these
circumstances
proved
fortunate
both
for
myself
and
augustus
for
had
matters
been
otherwise
he
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
reach
me
as
it
was
he
proceeded
with
confidence
in
his
design
it
was
near
daybreak
however
before
he
completed
the
second
division
of
the
board
which
was
about
a
foot
above
the
first
cut
thus
making
an
aperture
quite
large
enough
to
admit
his
passage
through
with
facility
to
the
main
orlop
deck
having
got
here
he
made
his
way
with
but
little
trouble
to
the
lower
main
hatch
although
in
so
doing
he
had
to
scramble
over
tiers
of
oil-casks
piled
nearly
as
high
as
the
upper
deck
there
being
barely
room
enough
left
for
his
body
upon
reaching
the
hatch
he
found
that
tiger
had
followed
him
below
squeezing
between
two
rows
of
the
casks
it
was
now
too
late
however
to
attempt
getting
to
me
before
dawn
as
the
chief
difficulty
lay
in
passing
through
the
close
stowage
in
the
lower
hold
he
therefore
resolved
to
return
and
wait
till
the
next
night
with
this
design
he
proceeded
to
loosen
the
hatch
so
that
he
might
have
as
little
detention
as
possible
when
he
should
come
again
no
sooner
had
he
loosened
it
than
tiger
sprang
eagerly
to
the
small
opening
produced
snuffed
for
a
moment
and
then
uttered
a
long
whine
scratching
at
the
same
time
as
if
anxious
to
remove
the
covering
with
his
paws
there
could
be
no
doubt
from
his
behaviour
that
he
was
aware
of
my
being
in
the
hold
and
augustus
thought
it
possible
that
he
would
be
able
to
get
to
me
if
he
put
him
down
he
now
hit
upon
the
expedient
of
sending
the
note
as
it
was
especially
desirable
that
i
should
make
no
attempt
at
forcing
my
way
out
at
least
under
existing
circumstances
and
there
could
be
no
certainty
of
his
getting
to
me
himself
on
the
morrow
as
he
intended
after-events
proved
how
fortunate
it
was
that
the
idea
occurred
to
him
as
it
did
for
had
it
not
been
for
the
receipt
of
the
note
i
should
undoubtedly
have
fallen
upon
some
plan
however
desperate
of
alarming
the
crew
and
both
our
lives
would
most
probably
have
been
sacrificed
in
consequence
having
concluded
to
write
the
difficulty
was
now
to
procure
the
materials
for
so
doing
an
old
toothpick
was
soon
made
into
a
pen
and
this
by
means
of
feeling
altogether
for
the
between-decks
was
as
dark
as
pitch
paper
enough
was
obtained
from
the
back
of
a
letter--a
duplicate
of
the
forged
letter
from
mr
ross
this
had
been
the
original
draught
but
the
handwriting
not
being
sufficiently
well
imitated
augustus
had
written
another
thrusting
the
first
by
good
fortune
into
his
coat-pocket
where
it
was
now
most
opportunely
discovered
ink
alone
was
thus
wanting
and
a
substitute
was
immediately
found
for
this
by
means
of
a
slight
incision
with
the
pen-knife
on
the
back
of
a
finger
just
above
the
nail--a
copious
flow
of
blood
ensuing
as
usual
from
wounds
in
that
vicinity
the
note
was
now
written
as
well
as
it
could
be
in
the
dark
and
under
the
circumstances
it
briefly
explained
that
a
mutiny
had
taken
place
that
captain
barnard
was
set
adrift
and
that
i
might
expect
immediate
relief
as
far
as
provisions
were
concerned
but
must
not
venture
upon
making
any
disturbance
it
concluded
with
these
words
â€œi
have
scrawled
this
with
blood--your
life
depends
upon
lying
closeâ€
this
slip
of
paper
being
tied
upon
the
dog
he
was
now
put
down
the
hatchway
and
augustus
made
the
best
of
his
way
back
to
the
forecastle
where
he
found
no
reason
to
believe
that
any
of
the
crew
had
been
in
his
absence
to
conceal
the
hole
in
the
partition
he
drove
his
knife
in
just
above
it
and
hung
up
a
pea-jacket
which
he
found
in
the
berth
his
handcuffs
were
then
replaced
and
also
the
rope
around
his
ankles
these
arrangements
were
scarcely
completed
when
dirk
peters
came
below
very
drunk
but
in
excellent
humour
and
bringing
with
him
my
friendâ€™s
allowance
of
provision
for
the
day
this
consisted
of
a
dozen
large
irish
potatoes
roasted
and
a
pitcher
of
water
he
sat
for
some
time
on
a
chest
by
the
berth
and
talked
freely
about
the
mate
and
the
general
concerns
of
the
brig
his
demeanour
was
exceedingly
capricious
and
even
grotesque
at
one
time
augustus
was
much
alarmed
by
odd
conduct
at
last
however
he
went
on
deck
muttering
a
promise
to
bring
his
prisoner
a
good
dinner
on
the
morrow
during
the
day
two
of
the
crew
harpooners
came
down
accompanied
by
the
cook
all
three
in
nearly
the
last
stage
of
intoxication
like
peters
they
made
no
scruple
of
talking
unreservedly
about
their
plans
it
appeared
that
they
were
much
divided
among
themselves
as
to
their
ultimate
course
agreeing
in
no
point
except
the
attack
on
the
ship
from
the
cape
verd
islands
with
which
they
were
in
hourly
expectation
of
meeting
as
far
as
could
be
ascertained
the
mutiny
had
not
been
brought
about
altogether
for
the
sake
of
booty
a
private
pique
of
the
chief
mateâ€™s
against
captain
barnard
having
been
the
main
instigation
there
now
seemed
to
be
two
principal
factions
among
the
crew--one
headed
by
the
mate
the
other
by
the
cook
the
former
party
were
for
seizing
the
first
suitable
vessel
which
should
present
itself
and
equipping
it
at
some
of
the
west
india
islands
for
a
piratical
cruise
the
latter
division
however
which
was
the
stronger
and
included
dirk
peters
among
its
partisans
were
bent
upon
pursuing
the
course
originally
laid
out
for
the
brig
into
the
south
pacific
there
either
to
take
whale
or
act
otherwise
as
circumstances
should
suggest
the
representations
of
peters
who
had
frequently
visited
these
regions
had
great
weight
apparently
with
the
mutineers
wavering
as
they
were
between
half-engendered
notions
of
profit
and
pleasure
he
dwelt
on
the
world
of
novelty
and
amusement
to
be
found
among
the
innumerable
islands
of
the
pacific
on
the
perfect
security
and
freedom
from
all
restraint
to
be
enjoyed
but
more
particularly
on
the
deliciousness
of
the
climate
on
the
abundant
means
of
good
living
and
on
the
voluptuous
beauty
of
the
women
as
yet
nothing
had
been
absolutely
determined
upon
but
the
pictures
of
the
hybrid
line-manager
were
taking
strong
hold
upon
the
ardent
imaginations
of
the
seamen
and
there
was
every
possibility
that
his
intentions
would
be
finally
carried
into
effect
the
three
men
went
away
in
about
an
hour
and
no
one
else
entered
the
forecastle
all
day
augustus
lay
quiet
until
nearly
night
he
then
freed
himself
from
the
rope
and
irons
and
prepared
for
his
attempt
a
bottle
was
found
in
one
of
the
berths
and
this
he
filled
with
water
from
the
pitcher
left
by
peters
storing
his
pockets
at
the
same
time
with
cold
potatoes
to
his
great
joy
he
also
came
across
a
lantern
with
a
small
piece
of
tallow
candle
in
it
this
he
could
light
at
any
moment
as
he
had
in
his
possession
a
box
of
phosphorus
matches
when
it
was
quite
dark
he
got
through
the
hole
in
the
bulkhead
having
taken
the
precaution
to
arrange
the
bedclothes
in
the
berth
so
as
to
convey
the
idea
of
a
person
covered
up
when
through
he
hung
up
the
pea-jacket
on
his
knife
as
before
to
conceal
the
aperture--this
manoeuvre
being
easily
effected
as
he
did
not
readjust
the
piece
of
plank
taken
out
until
afterward
he
was
now
on
the
main
orlop
deck
and
proceeded
to
make
his
way
as
before
between
the
upper
deck
and
the
oil-casks
to
the
main
hatchway
having
reached
this
he
lit
the
piece
of
candle
and
descended
groping
with
extreme
difficulty
among
the
compact
stowage
of
the
hold
in
a
few
moments
he
became
alarmed
at
the
insufferable
stench
and
the
closeness
of
the
atmosphere
he
could
not
think
it
possible
that
i
had
survived
my
confinement
for
so
long
a
period
breathing
so
oppressive
an
air
he
called
my
name
repeatedly
but
i
made
him
no
reply
and
his
apprehensions
seemed
thus
to
be
confirmed
the
brig
was
rolling
violently
and
there
was
so
much
noise
in
consequence
that
it
was
useless
to
listen
for
any
weak
sound
such
as
those
of
my
breathing
or
snoring
he
threw
open
the
lantern
and
held
it
as
high
as
possible
whenever
an
opportunity
occurred
in
order
that
by
observing
the
light
i
might
if
alive
be
aware
that
succor
was
approaching
still
nothing
was
heard
from
me
and
the
supposition
of
my
death
began
to
assume
the
character
of
certainty
he
determined
nevertheless
to
force
a
passage
if
possible
to
the
box
and
at
least
ascertain
beyond
a
doubt
the
truth
of
his
surmises
he
pushed
on
for
some
time
in
a
most
pitiable
state
of
anxiety
until
at
length
he
found
the
pathway
utterly
blocked
up
and
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
making
any
farther
way
by
the
course
in
which
he
had
set
out
overcome
now
by
his
feelings
he
threw
himself
among
the
lumber
in
despair
and
wept
like
a
child
it
was
at
this
period
that
he
heard
the
crash
occasioned
by
the
bottle
which
i
had
thrown
down
fortunate
indeed
was
it
that
the
incident
occurred--for
upon
this
incident
trivial
as
it
appears
the
thread
of
my
destiny
depended
many
years
elapsed
however
before
i
was
aware
of
this
fact
a
natural
shame
and
regret
for
his
weakness
and
indecision
prevented
augustus
from
confiding
to
me
at
once
what
a
more
intimate
and
unreserved
communion
afterward
induced
him
to
reveal
upon
finding
his
further
progress
in
the
hold
impeded
by
obstacles
which
he
could
not
overcome
he
had
resolved
to
abandon
his
attempt
at
reaching
me
and
return
at
once
to
the
forecastle
before
condemning
him
entirely
on
this
head
the
harassing
circumstances
which
embarrassed
him
should
be
taken
into
consideration
the
night
was
fast
wearing
away
and
his
absence
from
the
forecastle
might
be
discovered
and
indeed
would
necessarily
be
so
if
he
should
fail
to
get
back
to
the
berth
by
daybreak
his
candle
was
expiring
in
the
socket
and
there
would
be
the
greatest
difficulty
in
retracing
his
way
to
the
hatchway
in
the
dark
it
must
be
allowed
too
that
he
had
every
good
reason
to
believe
me
dead
in
which
event
no
benefit
could
result
to
me
from
his
reaching
the
box
and
a
world
of
danger
would
be
encountered
to
no
purpose
by
himself
he
had
repeatedly
called
and
i
had
made
him
no
answer
i
had
been
now
eleven
days
and
nights
with
no
more
water
than
that
contained
in
the
jug
which
he
had
left
with
me--a
supply
which
it
was
not
at
all
probable
i
had
hoarded
in
the
beginning
of
my
confinement
as
i
had
every
cause
to
expect
a
speedy
release
the
atmosphere
of
the
hold
too
must
have
appeared
to
him
coming
from
the
comparatively
open
air
of
the
steerage
of
a
nature
absolutely
poisonous
and
by
far
more
intolerable
than
it
had
seemed
to
me
upon
my
first
taking
up
my
quarters
in
the
box--the
hatchways
at
that
time
having
been
constantly
open
for
many
months
previous
add
to
these
considerations
that
of
the
scene
of
bloodshed
and
terror
so
lately
witnessed
by
my
friend
his
confinement
privations
and
narrow
escapes
from
death
together
with
the
frail
and
equivocal
tenure
by
which
he
still
existed--circumstances
all
so
well
calculated
to
prostrate
every
energy
of
mind--and
the
reader
will
be
easily
brought
as
i
have
been
to
regard
his
apparent
falling
off
in
friendship
and
in
faith
with
sentiments
rather
of
sorrow
than
of
anger
the
crash
of
the
bottle
was
distinctly
heard
yet
augustus
was
not
sure
that
it
proceeded
from
the
hold
the
doubt
however
was
sufficient
inducement
to
persevere
he
clambered
up
nearly
to
the
orlop
deck
by
means
of
the
stowage
and
then
watching
for
a
lull
in
the
pitchings
of
the
vessel
he
called
out
to
me
in
as
loud
a
tone
as
he
could
command
regardless
for
the
moment
of
being
overheard
by
the
crew
it
will
be
remembered
that
on
this
occasion
the
voice
reached
me
but
i
was
so
entirely
overcome
by
violent
agitation
as
to
be
incapable
of
reply
confident
now
that
his
worst
apprehensions
were
well
founded
he
descended
with
a
view
of
getting
back
to
the
forecastle
without
loss
of
time
in
his
haste
some
small
boxes
were
thrown
down
the
noise
occasioned
by
which
i
heard
as
will
be
recollected
he
had
made
considerable
progress
on
his
return
when
the
fall
of
the
knife
again
caused
him
to
hesitate
he
retraced
his
steps
immediately
and
clambering
up
the
stowage
a
second
time
called
out
my
name
loudly
as
before
having
watched
for
a
lull
this
time
i
found
voice
to
answer
overjoyed
at
discovering
me
to
be
still
alive
he
now
resolved
to
brave
every
difficulty
and
danger
in
reaching
me
having
extricated
himself
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
labyrinth
of
lumber
by
which
he
was
hemmed
in
he
at
length
struck
into
an
opening
which
promised
better
and
finally
after
a
series
of
struggles
arrived
at
the
box
in
a
state
of
utter
exhaustion
the
leading
particulars
of
this
narration
were
all
that
augustus
communicated
to
me
while
we
remained
near
the
box
it
was
not
until
afterward
that
he
entered
fully
into
all
the
details
he
was
apprehensive
of
being
missed
and
i
was
wild
with
impatience
to
leave
my
detested
place
of
confinement
we
resolved
to
make
our
way
at
once
to
the
hole
in
the
bulkhead
near
which
i
was
to
remain
for
the
present
while
he
went
through
to
reconnoiter
to
leave
tiger
in
the
box
was
what
neither
of
us
could
endure
to
think
of
yet
how
to
act
otherwise
was
the
question
he
now
seemed
to
be
perfectly
quiet
and
we
could
not
even
distinguish
the
sound
of
his
breathing
upon
applying
our
ears
closely
to
the
box
i
was
convinced
that
he
was
dead
and
determined
to
open
the
door
we
found
him
lying
at
full
length
apparently
in
a
deep
stupor
yet
still
alive
no
time
was
to
be
lost
yet
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
abandon
an
animal
who
had
now
been
twice
instrumental
in
saving
my
life
without
some
attempt
at
preserving
him
we
therefore
dragged
him
along
with
us
as
well
as
we
could
although
with
the
greatest
difficulty
and
fatigue
augustus
during
part
of
the
time
being
forced
to
clamber
over
the
impediments
in
our
way
with
the
huge
dog
in
his
arms--a
feat
to
which
the
feebleness
of
my
frame
rendered
me
totally
inadequate
at
length
we
succeeded
in
reaching
the
hole
when
augustus
got
through
and
tiger
was
pushed
in
afterward
all
was
found
to
be
safe
and
we
did
not
fail
to
return
sincere
thanks
to
god
for
our
deliverance
from
the
imminent
danger
we
had
escaped
for
the
present
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
remain
near
the
opening
through
which
my
companion
could
readily
supply
me
with
a
part
of
his
daily
provision
and
where
i
could
have
the
advantages
of
breathing
an
atmosphere
comparatively
pure
in
explanation
of
some
portions
of
this
narrative
wherein
i
have
spoken
of
the
stowage
of
the
brig
and
which
may
appear
ambiguous
to
some
of
my
readers
who
may
have
seen
a
proper
or
regular
stowage
i
must
here
state
that
the
manner
in
which
this
most
important
duty
had
been
performed
on
board
the
grampus
was
a
most
shameful
piece
of
neglect
on
the
part
of
captain
barnard
who
was
by
no
means
as
careful
or
as
experienced
a
seaman
as
the
hazardous
nature
of
the
service
on
which
he
was
employed
would
seem
necessarily
to
demand
a
proper
stowage
cannot
be
accomplished
in
a
careless
manner
and
many
most
disastrous
accidents
even
within
the
limits
of
my
own
experience
have
arisen
from
neglect
or
ignorance
in
this
particular
coasting
vessels
in
the
frequent
hurry
and
bustle
attendant
upon
taking
in
or
discharging
cargo
are
the
most
liable
to
mishap
from
the
want
of
a
proper
attention
to
stowage
the
great
point
is
to
allow
no
possibility
of
the
cargo
or
ballast
shifting
position
even
in
the
most
violent
rollings
of
the
vessel
with
this
end
great
attention
must
be
paid
not
only
to
the
bulk
taken
in
but
to
the
nature
of
the
bulk
and
whether
there
be
a
full
or
only
a
partial
cargo
in
most
kinds
of
freight
the
stowage
is
accomplished
by
means
of
a
screw
thus
in
a
load
of
tobacco
or
flour
the
whole
is
screwed
so
tightly
into
the
hold
of
the
vessel
that
the
barrels
or
hogsheads
upon
discharging
are
found
to
be
completely
flattened
and
take
some
time
to
regain
their
original
shape
this
screwing
however
is
resorted
to
principally
with
a
view
of
obtaining
more
room
in
the
hold
for
in
a
full
load
of
any
such
commodities
as
flour
or
tobacco
there
can
be
no
danger
of
any
shifting
whatever
at
least
none
from
which
inconvenience
can
result
there
have
been
instances
indeed
where
this
method
of
screwing
has
resulted
in
the
most
lamentable
consequences
arising
from
a
cause
altogether
distinct
from
the
danger
attendant
upon
a
shifting
of
cargo
a
load
of
cotton
for
example
tightly
screwed
while
in
certain
conditions
has
been
known
through
the
expansion
of
its
bulk
to
rend
a
vessel
asunder
at
sea
there
can
be
no
doubt
either
that
the
same
result
would
ensue
in
the
case
of
tobacco
while
undergoing
its
usual
course
of
fermentation
were
it
not
for
the
interstices
consequent
upon
the
rotundity
of
the
hogsheads
it
is
when
a
partial
cargo
is
received
that
danger
is
chiefly
to
be
apprehended
from
shifting
and
that
precautions
should
be
always
taken
to
guard
against
such
misfortune
only
those
who
have
encountered
a
violent
gale
of
wind
or
rather
who
have
experienced
the
rolling
of
a
vessel
in
a
sudden
calm
after
the
gale
can
form
an
idea
of
the
tremendous
force
of
the
plunges
and
of
the
consequent
terrible
impetus
given
to
all
loose
articles
in
the
vessel
it
is
then
that
the
necessity
of
a
cautious
stowage
when
there
is
a
partial
cargo
becomes
obvious
when
lying-to
especially
with
a
small
head
sail
a
vessel
which
is
not
properly
modelled
in
the
bows
is
frequently
thrown
upon
her
beam-ends
this
occurring
even
every
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
upon
an
average
yet
without
any
serious
consequences
resulting
provided
there
be
a
proper
stowage
if
this
however
has
not
been
strictly
attended
to
in
the
first
of
these
heavy
lurches
the
whole
of
the
cargo
tumbles
over
to
the
side
of
the
vessel
which
lies
upon
the
water
and
being
thus
prevented
from
regaining
her
equilibrium
as
she
would
otherwise
necessarily
do
she
is
certain
to
fill
in
a
few
seconds
and
go
down
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
at
least
one-half
of
the
instances
in
which
vessels
have
foundered
in
heavy
gales
at
sea
may
be
attributed
to
a
shifting
of
cargo
or
of
ballast
when
a
partial
cargo
of
any
kind
is
taken
on
board
the
whole
after
being
first
stowed
as
compactly
as
may
be
should
be
covered
with
a
layer
of
stout
shifting-boards
extending
completely
across
the
vessel
upon
these
boards
strong
temporary
stanchions
should
be
erected
reaching
to
the
timbers
above
and
thus
securing
every
thing
in
its
place
in
cargoes
consisting
of
grain
or
any
similar
matter
additional
precautions
are
requisite
a
hold
filled
entirely
with
grain
upon
leaving
port
will
be
found
not
more
than
three
fourths
full
upon
reaching
its
destination--this
too
although
the
freight
when
measured
bushel
by
bushel
by
the
consignee
will
overrun
by
a
vast
deal
on
account
of
the
swelling
of
the
grain
the
quantity
consigned
this
result
is
occasioned
by
settling
during
the
voyage
and
is
the
more
perceptible
in
proportion
to
the
roughness
of
the
weather
experienced
if
grain
loosely
thrown
in
a
vessel
then
is
ever
so
well
secured
by
shifting-boards
and
stanchions
it
will
be
liable
to
shift
in
a
long
passage
so
greatly
as
to
bring
about
the
most
distressing
calamities
to
prevent
these
every
method
should
be
employed
before
leaving
port
to
settle
the
cargo
as
much
as
possible
and
for
this
there
are
many
contrivances
among
which
may
be
mentioned
the
driving
of
wedges
into
the
grain
even
after
all
this
is
done
and
unusual
pains
taken
to
secure
the
shifting-boards
no
seaman
who
knows
what
he
is
about
will
feel
altogether
secure
in
a
gale
of
any
violence
with
a
cargo
of
grain
on
board
and
least
of
all
with
a
partial
cargo
yet
there
are
hundreds
of
our
coasting
vessels
and
it
is
likely
many
more
from
the
ports
of
europe
which
sail
daily
with
partial
cargoes
even
of
the
most
dangerous
species
and
without
any
precaution
whatever
the
wonder
is
that
no
more
accidents
occur
than
do
actually
happen
a
lamentable
instance
of
this
heedlessness
occurred
to
my
knowledge
in
the
case
of
captain
joel
rice
of
the
schooner
firefly
which
sailed
from
richmond
virginia
to
madeira
with
a
cargo
of
corn
in
the
year
1825
the
captain
had
gone
many
voyages
without
serious
accident
although
he
was
in
the
habit
of
paying
no
attention
whatever
to
his
stowage
more
than
to
secure
it
in
the
ordinary
manner
he
had
never
before
sailed
with
a
cargo
of
grain
and
on
this
occasion
had
the
corn
thrown
on
board
loosely
when
it
did
not
much
more
than
half
fill
the
vessel
for
the
first
portion
of
the
voyage
he
met
with
nothing
more
than
light
breezes
but
when
within
a
dayâ€™s
sail
of
madeira
there
came
on
a
strong
gale
from
the
n
n
e
which
forced
him
to
lie-to
he
brought
the
schooner
to
the
wind
under
a
double-reefed
foresail
alone
when
she
rode
as
well
as
any
vessel
could
be
expected
to
do
and
shipped
not
a
drop
of
water
toward
night
the
gale
somewhat
abated
and
she
rolled
with
more
unsteadiness
than
before
but
still
did
very
well
until
a
heavy
lurch
threw
her
upon
her
beam-ends
to
starboard
the
corn
was
then
heard
to
shift
bodily
the
force
of
the
movement
bursting
open
the
main
hatchway
the
vessel
went
down
like
a
shot
this
happened
within
hail
of
a
small
sloop
from
madeira
which
picked
up
one
of
the
crew
the
only
person
saved
and
which
rode
out
the
gale
in
perfect
security
as
indeed
a
jolly
boat
might
have
done
under
proper
management
the
stowage
on
board
the
grampus
was
most
clumsily
done
if
stowage
that
could
be
called
which
was
little
better
than
a
promiscuous
huddling
together
of
oil-casks
1
and
ship
furniture
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
condition
of
articles
in
the
hold
on
the
orlop
deck
there
was
space
enough
for
my
body
as
i
have
stated
between
the
oil-casks
and
the
upper
deck
a
space
was
left
open
around
the
main
hatchway
and
several
other
large
spaces
were
left
in
the
stowage
near
the
hole
cut
through
the
bulkhead
by
augustus
there
was
room
enough
for
an
entire
cask
and
in
this
space
i
found
myself
comfortably
situated
for
the
present
by
the
time
my
friend
had
got
safely
into
the
berth
and
readjusted
his
handcuffs
and
the
rope
it
was
broad
daylight
we
had
made
a
narrow
escape
indeed
for
scarcely
had
he
arranged
all
matters
when
the
mate
came
below
with
dirk
peters
and
the
cook
they
talked
for
some
time
about
the
vessel
from
the
cape
verds
and
seemed
to
be
excessively
anxious
for
her
appearance
at
length
the
cook
came
to
the
berth
in
which
augustus
was
lying
and
seated
himself
in
it
near
the
head
i
could
see
and
hear
every
thing
from
my
hiding-place
for
the
piece
cut
out
had
not
been
put
back
and
i
was
in
momentary
expectation
that
the
negro
would
fall
against
the
pea-jacket
which
was
hung
up
to
conceal
the
aperture
in
which
case
all
would
have
been
discovered
and
our
lives
would
no
doubt
have
been
instantly
sacrificed
our
good
fortune
prevailed
however
and
although
he
frequently
touched
it
as
the
vessel
rolled
he
never
pressed
against
it
sufficiently
to
bring
about
a
discovery
the
bottom
of
the
jacket
had
been
carefully
fastened
to
the
bulkhead
so
that
the
hole
might
not
be
seen
by
its
swinging
to
one
side
all
this
time
tiger
was
lying
in
the
foot
of
the
berth
and
appeared
to
have
recovered
in
some
measure
his
faculties
for
i
could
see
him
occasionally
open
his
eyes
and
draw
a
long
breath
after
a
few
minutes
the
mate
and
cook
went
above
leaving
dirk
peters
behind
who
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
came
and
sat
himself
down
in
the
place
just
occupied
by
the
mate
he
began
to
talk
very
sociably
with
augustus
and
we
could
now
see
that
the
greater
part
of
his
apparent
intoxication
while
the
two
others
were
with
him
was
a
feint
he
answered
all
my
companionâ€™s
questions
with
perfect
freedom
told
him
that
he
had
no
doubt
of
his
fatherâ€™s
having
been
picked
up
as
there
were
no
less
than
five
sail
in
sight
just
before
sundown
on
the
day
he
was
cut
adrift
and
used
other
language
of
a
consolatory
nature
which
occasioned
me
no
less
surprise
than
pleasure
indeed
i
began
to
entertain
hopes
that
through
the
instrumentality
of
peters
we
might
be
finally
enabled
to
regain
possession
of
the
brig
and
this
idea
i
mentioned
to
augustus
as
soon
as
i
found
an
opportunity
he
thought
the
matter
possible
but
urged
the
necessity
of
the
greatest
caution
in
making
the
attempt
as
the
conduct
of
the
hybrid
appeared
to
be
instigated
by
the
most
arbitrary
caprice
alone
and
indeed
it
was
difficult
to
say
if
he
was
at
any
moment
of
sound
mind
peters
went
upon
deck
in
about
an
hour
and
did
not
return
again
until
noon
when
he
brought
augustus
a
plentiful
supply
of
junk
beef
and
pudding
of
this
when
we
were
left
alone
i
partook
heartily
without
returning
through
the
hole
no
one
else
came
down
into
the
forecastle
during
the
day
and
at
night
i
got
into
augustusâ€™
berth
where
i
slept
soundly
and
sweetly
until
nearly
daybreak
when
he
awakened
me
upon
hearing
a
stir
upon
deck
and
i
regained
my
hiding-place
as
quickly
as
possible
when
the
day
was
fully
broke
we
found
that
tiger
had
recovered
his
strength
almost
entirely
and
gave
no
indications
of
hydrophobia
drinking
a
little
water
that
was
offered
him
with
great
apparent
eagerness
during
the
day
he
regained
all
his
former
vigour
and
appetite
his
strange
conduct
had
been
brought
on
no
doubt
by
the
deleterious
quality
of
the
air
of
the
hold
and
had
no
connexion
with
canine
madness
i
could
not
sufficiently
rejoice
that
i
had
persisted
in
bringing
him
with
me
from
the
box
this
day
was
the
thirtieth
of
june
and
the
thirteenth
since
the
grampus
made
sail
from
nantucket
on
the
second
of
july
the
mate
came
below
drunk
as
usual
and
in
an
excessively
good-humor
he
came
to
augustusâ€™s
berth
and
giving
him
a
slap
on
the
back
asked
him
if
he
thought
he
could
behave
himself
if
he
let
him
loose
and
whether
he
would
promise
not
to
be
going
into
the
cabin
again
to
this
of
course
my
friend
answered
in
the
affirmative
when
the
ruffian
set
him
at
liberty
after
making
him
drink
from
a
flask
of
rum
which
he
drew
from
his
coat-pocket
both
now
went
on
deck
and
i
did
not
see
augustus
for
about
three
hours
he
then
came
below
with
the
good
news
that
he
had
obtained
permission
to
go
about
the
brig
as
he
pleased
anywhere
forward
of
the
mainmast
and
that
he
had
been
ordered
to
sleep
as
usual
in
the
forecastle
he
brought
me
too
a
good
dinner
and
a
plentiful
supply
of
water
the
brig
was
still
cruising
for
the
vessel
from
the
cape
verds
and
a
sail
was
now
in
sight
which
was
thought
to
be
the
one
in
question
as
the
events
of
the
ensuing
eight
days
were
of
little
importance
and
had
no
direct
bearing
upon
the
main
incidents
of
my
narrative
i
will
here
throw
them
into
the
form
of
a
journal
as
i
do
not
wish
to
omit
them
altogether
july
3
augustus
furnished
me
with
three
blankets
with
which
i
contrived
a
comfortable
bed
in
my
hiding-place
no
one
came
below
except
my
companion
during
the
day
tiger
took
his
station
in
the
berth
just
by
the
aperture
and
slept
heavily
as
if
not
yet
entirely
recovered
from
the
effects
of
his
sickness
toward
night
a
flaw
of
wind
struck
the
brig
before
sail
could
be
taken
in
and
very
nearly
capsized
her
the
puff
died
away
immediately
however
and
no
damage
was
done
beyond
the
splitting
of
the
foretopsail
dirk
peters
treated
augustus
all
this
day
with
great
kindness
and
entered
into
a
long
conversation
with
him
respecting
the
pacific
ocean
and
the
islands
he
had
visited
in
that
region
he
asked
him
whether
he
would
not
like
to
go
with
the
mutineers
on
a
kind
of
exploring
and
pleasure
voyage
in
those
quarters
and
said
that
the
men
were
gradually
coming
over
to
the
mateâ€™s
views
to
this
augustus
thought
it
best
to
reply
that
he
would
be
glad
to
go
on
such
an
adventure
since
nothing
better
could
be
done
and
that
any
thing
was
preferable
to
a
piratical
life
july
4th
the
vessel
in
sight
proved
to
be
a
small
brig
from
liverpool
and
was
allowed
to
pass
unmolested
augustus
spent
most
of
his
time
on
deck
with
a
view
of
obtaining
all
the
information
in
his
power
respecting
the
intentions
of
the
mutineers
they
had
frequent
and
violent
quarrels
among
themselves
in
one
of
which
a
harpooner
jim
bonner
was
thrown
overboard
the
party
of
the
mate
was
gaining
ground
jim
bonner
belonged
to
the
cookâ€™s
gang
of
which
peters
was
a
partisan
july
5th
about
daybreak
there
came
on
a
stiff
breeze
from
the
west
which
at
noon
freshened
into
a
gale
so
that
the
brig
could
carry
nothing
more
than
her
trysail
and
foresail
in
taking
in
the
foretopsail
simms
one
of
the
common
hands
and
belonging
also
to
the
cookâ€™s
gang
fell
overboard
being
very
much
in
liquor
and
was
drowned--no
attempt
being
made
to
save
him
the
whole
number
of
persons
on
board
was
now
thirteen
to
wit

augustus
and
myself
july
6th
the
gale
lasted
all
this
day
blowing
in
heavy
squalls
accompanied
with
rain
the
brig
took
in
a
good
deal
of
water
through
her
seams
and
one
of
the
pumps
was
kept
continually
going
augustus
being
forced
to
take
his
turn
just
at
twilight
a
large
ship
passed
close
by
us
without
having
been
discovered
until
within
hail
the
ship
was
supposed
to
be
the
one
for
which
the
mutineers
were
on
the
lookout
the
mate
hailed
her
but
the
reply
was
drowned
in
the
roaring
of
the
gale
at
eleven
a
sea
was
shipped
amidships
which
tore
away
a
great
portion
of
the
larboard
bulwarks
and
did
some
other
slight
damage
toward
morning
the
weather
moderated
and
at
sunrise
there
was
very
little
wind
july
7th
there
was
a
heavy
swell
running
all
this
day
during
which
the
brig
being
light
rolled
excessively
and
many
articles
broke
loose
in
the
hold
as
i
could
hear
distinctly
from
my
hiding-place
i
suffered
a
great
deal
from
sea-sickness
peters
had
a
long
conversation
this
day
with
augustus
and
told
him
that
two
of
his
gang
greely
and
allen
had
gone
over
to
the
mate
and
were
resolved
to
turn
pirates
he
put
several
questions
to
augustus
which
he
did
not
then
exactly
understand
during
a
part
of
this
evening
the
leak
gained
upon
the
vessel
and
little
could
be
done
to
remedy
it
as
it
was
occasioned
by
the
brig's
straining
and
taking
in
the
water
through
her
seams
a
sail
was
thrummed
and
got
under
the
bows
which
aided
us
in
some
measure
so
that
we
began
to
gain
upon
the
leak
july
8th
a
light
breeze
sprang
up
at
sunrise
from
the
eastward
when
the
mate
headed
the
brig
to
the
southwest
with
the
intention
of
making
some
of
the
west
india
islands
in
pursuance
of
his
piratical
designs
no
opposition
was
made
by
peters
or
the
cook--at
least
none
in
the
hearing
of
augustus
all
idea
of
taking
the
vessel
from
the
cape
verds
was
abandoned
the
leak
was
now
easily
kept
under
by
one
pump
going
every
three
quarters
of
an
hour
the
sail
was
drawn
from
beneath
the
bows
spoke
two
small
schooners
during
the
day
july
9th
fine
weather
all
hands
employed
in
repairing
bulwarks
peters
had
again
a
long
conversation
with
augustus
and
spoke
more
plainly
than
he
had
done
heretofore
he
said
nothing
should
induce
him
to
come
into
the
mateâ€™s
views
and
even
hinted
his
intention
of
taking
the
brig
out
of
his
hands
he
asked
my
friend
if
he
could
depend
upon
his
aid
in
such
case
to
which
augustus
said
â€œyesâ€
without
hesitation
peters
then
said
he
would
sound
the
others
of
his
party
upon
the
subject
and
went
away
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
augustus
had
no
opportunity
of
speaking
with
him
privately
july
10
spoke
a
brig
from
rio
bound
to
norfolk
weather
hazy
with
a
light
baffling
wind
from
the
eastward
to-day
hartman
rogers
died
having
been
attacked
on
the
eighth
with
spasms
after
drinking
a
glass
of
grog
this
man
was
of
the
cookâ€™s
party
and
one
upon
whom
peters
placed
his
main
reliance
he
told
augustus
that
he
believed
the
mate
had
poisoned
him
and
that
he
expected
if
he
did
not
be
on
the
look-out
his
own
turn
would
come
shortly
there
were
now
only
himself
jones
and
the
cook
belonging
to
his
own
gang--on
the
other
side
there
were
five
he
had
spoken
to
jones
about
taking
the
command
from
the
mate
but
the
project
having
been
coolly
received
he
had
been
deterred
from
pressing
the
matter
any
further
or
from
saying
any
thing
to
the
cook
it
was
well
as
it
happened
that
he
was
so
prudent
for
in
the
afternoon
the
cook
expressed
his
determination
of
siding
with
the
mate
and
went
over
formally
to
that
party
while
jones
took
an
opportunity
of
quarrelling
with
peters
and
hinted
that
he
would
let
the
mate
know
of
the
plan
in
agitation
there
was
now
evidently
no
time
to
be
lost
and
peters
expressed
his
determination
of
attempting
to
take
the
vessel
at
all
hazards
provided
augustus
would
lend
him
his
aid
my
friend
at
once
assured
him
of
his
willingness
to
enter
into
any
plan
for
that
purpose
and
thinking
the
opportunity
a
favourable
one
made
known
the
fact
of
my
being
on
board
at
this
the
hybrid
was
not
more
astonished
than
delighted
as
he
had
no
reliance
whatever
upon
jones
whom
he
already
considered
as
belonging
to
the
party
of
the
mate
they
went
below
immediately
when
augustus
called
to
me
by
name
and
peters
and
myself
were
soon
made
acquainted
it
was
agreed
that
we
should
attempt
to
retake
the
vessel
upon
the
first
good
opportunity
leaving
jones
altogether
out
of
our
councils
in
the
event
of
success
we
were
to
run
the
brig
into
the
first
port
that
offered
and
deliver
her
up
the
desertion
of
his
party
had
frustrated
petersâ€™
design
of
going
into
the
pacific--an
adventure
which
could
not
be
accomplished
without
a
crew
and
he
depended
upon
either
getting
acquitted
upon
trial
on
the
score
of
insanity
which
he
solemnly
avowed
had
actuated
him
in
lending
his
aid
to
the
mutiny
or
upon
obtaining
a
pardon
if
found
guilty
through
the
representations
of
augustus
and
myself
our
deliberations
were
interrupted
for
the
present
by
the
cry
of
â€œall
hands
take
in
sailâ€
and
peters
and
augustus
ran
up
on
deck
as
usual
the
crew
were
nearly
all
drunk
and
before
sail
could
be
properly
taken
in
a
violent
squall
laid
the
brig
on
her
beam-ends
by
keeping
her
away
however
she
righted
having
shipped
a
good
deal
of
water
scarcely
was
everything
secure
when
another
squall
took
the
vessel
and
immediately
afterward
another--no
damage
being
done
there
was
every
appearance
of
a
gale
of
wind
which
indeed
shortly
came
on
with
great
fury
from
the
northward
and
westward
all
was
made
as
snug
as
possible
and
we
laid-to
as
usual
under
a
close-reefed
foresail
as
night
drew
on
the
wind
increased
in
violence
with
a
remarkably
heavy
sea
peters
now
came
into
the
forecastle
with
augustus
and
we
resumed
our
deliberations
we
agreed
that
no
opportunity
could
be
more
favourable
than
the
present
for
carrying
our
designs
into
effect
as
an
attempt
at
such
a
moment
would
never
be
anticipated
as
the
brig
was
snugly
laid-to
there
would
be
no
necessity
of
manoeuvring
her
until
good
weather
when
if
we
succeeded
in
our
attempt
we
might
liberate
one
or
perhaps
two
of
the
men
to
aid
us
in
taking
her
into
port
the
main
difficulty
was
the
great
disproportion
in
our
forces
there
were
only
three
of
us
and
in
the
cabin
there
were
nine
all
the
arms
on
board
too
were
in
their
possession
with
the
exception
of
a
pair
of
small
pistols
which
peters
had
concealed
about
his
person
and
the
large
seamanâ€™s
knife
which
he
always
wore
in
the
waistband
of
his
pantaloons
from
certain
indications
too--such
for
example
as
there
being
no
such
thing
as
an
axe
or
a
handspike
lying
in
their
customary
places--we
began
to
fear
that
the
mate
had
his
suspicions
at
least
in
regard
to
peters
and
that
he
would
let
slip
no
opportunity
of
getting
rid
of
him
it
was
clear
indeed
that
what
we
should
determine
to
do
could
not
be
done
too
soon
still
the
odds
were
too
much
against
us
to
allow
of
our
proceeding
without
the
greatest
caution
peters
proposed
that
he
should
go
up
on
deck
and
enter
into
conversation
with
the
watch
allen
when
he
would
be
able
to
throw
him
into
the
sea
without
trouble
and
without
making
any
disturbance
by
seizing
a
good
opportunity
that
augustus
and
myself
should
then
come
up
and
endeavour
to
provide
ourselves
with
some
kind
of
weapons
from
the
deck
and
that
we
should
then
make
a
rush
together
and
secure
the
companion-way
before
any
opposition
could
be
offered
i
objected
to
this
because
i
could
not
believe
that
the
mate
who
was
a
cunning
fellow
in
all
matters
which
did
not
affect
his
superstitious
prejudices
would
suffer
himself
to
be
so
easily
entrapped
the
very
fact
of
there
being
a
watch
on
deck
at
all
was
sufficient
proof
that
he
was
upon
the
alert--it
not
being
usual
except
in
vessels
where
discipline
is
most
rigidly
enforced
to
station
a
watch
on
deck
when
a
vessel
is
lying-to
in
a
gale
of
wind
as
i
address
myself
principally
if
not
altogether
to
persons
who
have
never
been
to
sea
it
may
be
as
well
to
state
the
exact
condition
of
a
vessel
under
such
circumstances
lying-to
or
in
sea-parlance
â€œlaying-toâ€
is
a
measure
resorted
to
for
various
purposes
and
effected
in
various
manners
in
moderate
weather
it
is
frequently
done
with
a
view
of
merely
bringing
the
vessel
to
a
stand-still
to
wait
for
another
vessel
or
any
similar
object
if
the
vessel
which
lies-to
is
under
full
sail
the
manoeuvre
is
usually
accomplished
by
throwing
round
some
portion
of
her
sails
so
as
to
let
the
wind
take
them
aback
when
she
becomes
stationary
but
we
are
now
speaking
of
lying-to
in
a
gale
of
wind
this
is
done
when
the
wind
is
ahead
and
too
violent
to
admit
of
carrying
sail
without
danger
of
capsizing
and
sometimes
even
when
the
wind
is
fair
but
the
sea
too
heavy
for
the
vessel
to
be
put
before
it
if
a
vessel
be
suffered
to
scud
before
the
wind
in
a
very
heavy
sea
much
damage
is
usually
done
her
by
the
shipping
of
water
over
her
stern
and
sometimes
by
the
violent
plunges
she
makes
forward
this
manoeuvre
then
is
seldom
resorted
to
in
such
case
unless
through
necessity
when
the
vessel
is
in
a
leaky
condition
she
is
often
put
before
the
wind
even
in
the
heaviest
seas
for
when
lying-to
her
seams
are
sure
to
be
greatly
opened
by
her
violent
straining
and
it
is
not
so
much
the
case
when
scudding
often
too
it
becomes
necessary
to
scud
a
vessel
either
when
the
blast
is
so
exceedingly
furious
as
to
tear
in
pieces
the
sail
which
is
employed
with
a
view
of
bringing
her
head
to
the
wind
or
when
through
the
false
modelling
of
the
frame
or
other
causes
this
main
object
cannot
be
effected
vessels
in
a
gale
of
wind
are
laid-to
in
different
manners
according
to
their
peculiar
construction
some
lie-to
best
under
a
foresail
and
this
i
believe
is
the
sail
most
usually
employed
large
square-rigged
vessels
have
sails
for
the
express
purpose
called
storm-staysails
but
the
jib
is
occasionally
employed
by
itself--sometimes
the
jib
and
foresail
or
a
double-reefed
foresail
and
not
unfrequently
the
after-sails
are
made
use
of
foretopsails
are
very
often
found
to
answer
the
purpose
better
than
any
other
species
of
sail
the
grampus
was
generally
laid-to
under
a
close-reefed
foresail
when
a
vessel
is
to
be
laid-to
her
head
is
brought
up
to
the
wind
just
so
nearly
as
to
fill
the
sail
under
which
she
lies
when
hauled
flat
aft
that
is
when
brought
diagonally
across
the
vessel
this
being
done
the
bows
point
within
a
few
degrees
of
the
direction
from
which
the
wind
issues
and
the
windward
bow
of
course
receives
the
shock
of
the
waves
in
this
situation
a
good
vessel
will
ride
out
a
very
heavy
gale
of
wind
without
shipping
a
drop
of
water
and
without
any
further
attention
being
requisite
on
the
part
of
the
crew
the
helm
is
usually
lashed
down
but
this
is
altogether
unnecessary
except
on
account
of
the
noise
it
makes
when
loose
for
the
rudder
has
no
effect
upon
the
vessel
when
lying-to
indeed
the
helm
had
far
better
be
left
loose
than
lashed
very
fast
for
the
rudder
is
apt
to
be
torn
off
by
heavy
seas
if
there
be
no
room
for
the
helm
to
play
as
long
as
the
sail
holds
a
well
modelled
vessel
will
maintain
her
situation
and
ride
every
sea
as
if
instinct
with
life
and
reason
if
the
violence
of
the
wind
however
should
tear
the
sail
into
pieces
a
feat
which
it
requires
a
perfect
hurricane
to
accomplish
under
ordinary
circumstances
there
is
then
imminent
danger
the
vessel
falls
off
from
the
wind
and
coming
broadside
to
the
sea
is
completely
at
its
mercy
the
only
resource
in
this
case
is
to
put
her
quietly
before
the
wind
letting
her
scud
until
some
other
sail
can
be
set
some
vessels
will
lie-to
under
no
sail
whatever
but
such
are
not
to
be
trusted
at
sea
but
to
return
from
this
digression
it
had
never
been
customary
with
the
mate
to
have
any
watch
on
deck
when
lying-to
in
a
gale
of
wind
and
the
fact
that
he
had
now
one
coupled
with
the
circumstance
of
the
missing
axes
and
handspikes
fully
convinced
us
that
the
crew
were
too
well
on
the
watch
to
be
taken
by
surprise
in
the
manner
peters
had
suggested
something
however
was
to
be
done
and
that
with
as
little
delay
as
practicable
for
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
a
suspicion
having
been
once
entertained
against
peters
he
would
be
sacrificed
upon
the
earliest
occasion
and
one
would
certainly
be
either
found
or
made
upon
the
breaking
of
the
gale
augustus
now
suggested
that
if
peters
could
contrive
to
remove
under
any
pretext
the
piece
of
chain-cable
which
lay
over
the
trap
in
the
stateroom
we
might
possibly
be
able
to
come
upon
them
unawares
by
means
of
the
hold
but
a
little
reflection
convinced
us
that
the
vessel
rolled
and
pitched
too
violently
for
any
attempt
of
that
nature
by
good
fortune
i
at
length
hit
upon
the
idea
of
working
upon
the
superstitious
terrors
and
guilty
conscience
of
the
mate
it
will
be
remembered
that
one
of
the
crew
hartman
rogers
had
died
during
the
morning
having
been
attacked
two
days
before
with
spasms
after
drinking
some
spirits
and
water
peters
had
expressed
to
us
his
opinion
that
this
man
had
been
poisoned
by
the
mate
and
for
this
belief
he
had
reasons
so
he
said
which
were
incontrovertible
but
which
he
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
explain
to
us--this
wayward
refusal
being
only
in
keeping
with
other
points
of
his
singular
character
but
whether
or
not
he
had
any
better
grounds
for
suspecting
the
mate
than
we
had
ourselves
we
were
easily
led
to
fall
in
with
his
suspicion
and
determined
to
act
accordingly
rogers
had
died
about
eleven
in
the
forenoon
in
violent
convulsions
and
the
corpse
presented
in
a
few
minutes
after
death
one
of
the
most
horrid
and
loathsome
spectacles
i
ever
remember
to
have
seen
the
stomach
was
swollen
immensely
like
that
of
a
man
who
has
been
drowned
and
lain
under
water
for
many
weeks
the
hands
were
in
the
same
condition
while
the
face
was
shrunken
shrivelled
and
of
a
chalky
whiteness
except
where
relieved
by
two
or
three
glaring
red
blotches
like
those
occasioned
by
the
erysipelas
one
of
these
blotches
extended
diagonally
across
the
face
completely
covering
up
an
eye
as
if
with
a
band
of
red
velvet
in
this
disgusting
condition
the
body
had
been
brought
up
from
the
cabin
at
noon
to
be
thrown
overboard
when
the
mate
getting
a
glimpse
of
it
for
he
now
saw
it
for
the
first
time
and
being
either
touched
with
remorse
for
his
crime
or
struck
with
terror
at
so
horrible
a
sight
ordered
the
men
to
sew
the
body
up
in
its
hammock
and
allow
it
the
usual
rites
of
sea-burial
having
given
these
directions
he
went
below
as
if
to
avoid
any
further
sight
of
his
victim
while
preparations
were
making
to
obey
his
orders
the
gale
came
on
with
great
fury
and
the
design
was
abandoned
for
the
present
the
corpse
left
to
itself
was
washed
into
the
larboard
scuppers
where
it
still
lay
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
floundering
about
with
the
furious
lurches
of
the
brig
having
arranged
our
plan
we
set
about
putting
it
in
execution
as
speedily
as
possible
peters
went
upon
deck
and
as
he
had
anticipated
was
immediately
accosted
by
allen
who
appeared
to
be
stationed
more
as
a
watch
upon
the
forecastle
than
for
any
other
purpose
the
fate
of
this
villain
however
was
speedily
and
silently
decided
for
peters
approaching
him
in
a
careless
manner
as
if
about
to
address
him
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
before
he
could
utter
a
single
cry
tossed
him
over
the
bulwarks
he
then
called
to
us
and
we
came
up
our
first
precaution
was
to
look
about
for
something
with
which
to
arm
ourselves
and
in
doing
this
we
had
to
proceed
with
great
care
for
it
was
impossible
to
stand
on
deck
an
instant
without
holding
fast
and
violent
seas
broke
over
the
vessel
at
every
plunge
forward
it
was
indispensable
too
that
we
should
be
quick
in
our
operations
for
every
minute
we
expected
the
mate
to
be
up
to
set
the
pumps
going
as
it
was
evident
the
brig
must
be
taking
in
water
very
fast
after
searching
about
for
some
time
we
could
find
nothing
more
fit
for
our
purpose
than
the
two
pump-handles
one
of
which
augustus
took
and
i
the
other
having
secured
these
we
stripped
off
the
shirt
of
the
corpse
and
dropped
the
body
overboard
peters
and
myself
then
went
below
leaving
augustus
to
watch
upon
deck
where
he
took
his
station
just
where
allen
had
been
placed
and
with
his
back
to
the
cabin
companionway
so
that
if
any
of
the
mate's
gang
should
come
up
he
might
suppose
it
was
the
watch
as
soon
as
i
got
below
i
commenced
disguising
myself
so
as
to
represent
the
corpse
of
rogers
the
shirt
which
we
had
taken
from
the
body
aided
us
very
much
for
it
was
of
singular
form
and
character
and
easily
recognizable--a
kind
of
smock
which
the
deceased
wore
over
his
other
clothing
it
was
a
blue
stockinett
with
large
white
stripes
running
across
having
put
this
on
i
proceeded
to
equip
myself
with
a
false
stomach
in
imitation
of
the
horrible
deformity
of
the
swollen
corpse
this
was
soon
effected
by
means
of
stuffing
with
some
bedclothes
i
then
gave
the
same
appearance
to
my
hands
by
drawing
on
a
pair
of
white
woollen
mittens
and
filling
them
in
with
any
kind
of
rags
that
offered
themselves
peters
then
arranged
my
face
first
rubbing
it
well
over
with
white
chalk
and
afterward
blotching
it
with
blood
which
he
took
from
a
cut
in
his
finger
the
streak
across
the
eye
was
not
forgotten
and
presented
a
most
shocking
appearance
as
i
viewed
myself
in
a
fragment
of
looking-glass
which
hung
up
in
the
cabin
and
by
the
dim
light
of
a
kind
of
battle-lantern
i
was
so
impressed
with
a
sense
of
vague
awe
at
my
appearance
and
at
the
recollection
of
the
terrific
reality
which
i
was
thus
representing
that
i
was
seized
with
a
violent
tremour
and
could
scarcely
summon
resolution
to
go
on
with
my
part
it
was
necessary
however
to
act
with
decision
and
peters
and
myself
went
upon
deck
we
there
found
everything
safe
and
keeping
close
to
the
bulwarks
the
three
of
us
crept
to
the
cabin
companion-way
it
was
only
partially
closed
precautions
having
been
taken
to
prevent
its
being
suddenly
pushed
to
from
without
by
means
of
placing
billets
of
wood
on
the
upper
step
so
as
to
interfere
with
the
shutting
we
found
no
difficulty
in
getting
a
full
view
of
the
interior
of
the
cabin
through
the
cracks
where
the
hinges
were
placed
it
now
proved
to
have
been
very
fortunate
for
us
that
we
had
not
attempted
to
take
them
by
surprise
for
they
were
evidently
on
the
alert
only
one
was
asleep
and
he
lying
just
at
the
foot
of
the
companion-ladder
with
a
musket
by
his
side
the
rest
were
seated
on
several
mattresses
which
had
been
taken
from
the
berths
and
thrown
on
the
floor
they
were
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
and
although
they
had
been
carousing
as
appeared
from
two
empty
jugs
with
some
tin
tumblers
which
lay
about
they
were
not
as
much
intoxicated
as
usual
all
had
knives
one
or
two
of
them
pistols
and
a
great
many
muskets
were
lying
in
a
berth
close
at
hand
we
listened
to
their
conversation
for
some
time
before
we
could
make
up
our
minds
how
to
act
having
as
yet
resolved
on
nothing
determinate
except
that
we
would
attempt
to
paralyze
their
exertions
when
we
should
attack
them
by
means
of
the
apparition
of
rogers
they
were
discussing
their
piratical
plans
in
which
all
we
could
hear
distinctly
was
that
they
would
unite
with
the
crew
of
a
schooner
hornet
and
if
possible
get
the
schooner
herself
into
their
possession
preparatory
to
some
attempt
on
a
large
scale
the
particulars
of
which
could
not
be
made
out
by
either
of
us
one
of
the
men
spoke
of
peters
when
the
mate
replied
to
him
in
a
low
voice
which
could
not
be
distinguished
and
afterward
added
more
loudly
that
â€œhe
could
not
understand
his
being
so
much
forward
with
the
captainâ€™s
brat
in
the
forecastle
and
he
thought
the
sooner
both
of
them
were
overboard
the
betterâ€
to
this
no
answer
was
made
but
we
could
easily
perceive
that
the
hint
was
well
received
by
the
whole
party
and
more
particularly
by
jones
at
this
period
i
was
excessively
agitated
the
more
so
as
i
could
see
that
neither
augustus
nor
peters
could
determine
how
to
act
i
made
up
my
mind
however
to
sell
my
life
as
dearly
as
possible
and
not
to
suffer
myself
to
be
overcome
by
any
feelings
of
trepidation
the
tremendous
noise
made
by
the
roaring
of
the
wind
in
the
rigging
and
the
washing
of
the
sea
over
the
deck
prevented
us
from
hearing
what
was
said
except
during
momentary
lulls
in
one
of
these
we
all
distinctly
heard
the
mate
tell
one
of
the
men
to
â€œgo
forward
have
an
eye
upon
them
for
he
wanted
no
such
secret
doings
on
board
the
brigâ€
it
was
well
for
us
that
the
pitching
of
the
vessel
at
this
moment
was
so
violent
as
to
prevent
this
order
from
being
carried
into
instant
execution
the
cook
got
up
from
his
mattress
to
go
for
us
when
a
tremendous
lurch
which
i
thought
would
carry
away
the
masts
threw
him
headlong
against
one
of
the
larboard
stateroom
doors
bursting
it
open
and
creating
a
good
deal
of
other
confusion
luckily
neither
of
our
party
was
thrown
from
his
position
and
we
had
time
to
make
a
precipitate
retreat
to
the
forecastle
and
arrange
a
hurried
plan
of
action
before
the
messenger
made
his
appearance
or
rather
before
he
put
his
head
out
of
the
companion-hatch
for
he
did
not
come
on
deck
from
this
station
he
could
not
notice
the
absence
of
allen
and
he
accordingly
bawled
out
as
if
to
him
repeating
the
orders
of
the
mate
peters
cried
out
â€œay
ayâ€
in
a
disguised
voice
and
the
cook
immediately
went
below
without
entertaining
a
suspicion
that
all
was
not
right
my
two
companions
now
proceeded
boldly
aft
and
down
into
the
cabin
peters
closing
the
door
after
him
in
the
same
manner
he
had
found
it
the
mate
received
them
with
feigned
cordiality
and
told
augustus
that
since
he
had
behaved
himself
so
well
of
late
he
might
take
up
his
quarters
in
the
cabin
and
be
one
of
them
for
the
future
he
then
poured
him
out
a
tumbler
half
full
of
rum
and
made
him
drink
it
all
this
i
saw
and
heard
for
i
followed
my
friends
to
the
cabin
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
and
took
up
my
old
point
of
observation
i
had
brought
with
me
the
two
pump-handles
one
of
which
i
secured
near
the
companion-way
to
be
ready
for
use
when
required
i
now
steadied
myself
as
well
as
possible
so
as
to
have
a
good
view
of
all
that
was
passing
within
and
endeavoured
to
nerve
myself
to
the
task
of
descending
among
the
mutineers
when
peters
should
make
a
signal
to
me
as
agreed
upon
presently
he
contrived
to
turn
the
conversation
upon
the
bloody
deeds
of
the
mutiny
and
by
degrees
led
the
men
to
talk
of
the
thousand
superstitions
which
are
so
universally
current
among
seamen
i
could
not
make
out
all
that
was
said
but
i
could
plainly
see
the
effects
of
the
conversation
in
the
countenances
of
those
present
the
mate
was
evidently
much
agitated
and
presently
when
some
one
mentioned
the
terrific
appearance
of
rogersâ€™
corpse
i
thought
he
was
upon
the
point
of
swooning
peters
now
asked
him
if
he
did
not
think
it
would
be
better
to
have
the
body
thrown
overboard
at
once
as
it
was
too
horrible
a
sight
to
see
it
floundering
about
in
the
scuppers
at
this
the
villain
absolutely
gasped
for
breath
and
turned
his
head
slowly
round
upon
his
companions
as
if
imploring
some
one
to
go
up
and
perform
the
task
no
one
however
stirred
and
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
whole
party
were
wound
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
nervous
excitement
peters
now
made
me
the
signal
i
immediately
threw
open
the
door
of
the
companion-way
and
descending
without
uttering
a
syllable
stood
erect
in
the
midst
of
the
party
the
intense
effect
produced
by
this
sudden
apparition
is
not
at
all
to
be
wondered
at
when
the
various
circumstances
are
taken
into
consideration
usually
in
cases
of
a
similar
nature
there
is
left
in
the
mind
of
the
spectator
some
glimmering
of
doubt
as
to
the
reality
of
the
vision
before
his
eyes
a
degree
of
hope
however
feeble
that
he
is
the
victim
of
chicanery
and
that
the
apparition
is
not
actually
a
visitant
from
the
old
world
of
shadows
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
such
remnants
of
doubt
have
been
at
the
bottom
of
almost
every
such
visitation
and
that
the
appalling
horror
which
has
sometimes
been
brought
about
is
to
be
attributed
even
in
the
cases
most
in
point
and
where
most
suffering
has
been
experienced
more
to
a
kind
of
anticipative
horror
lest
the
apparition
might
possibly
be
real
than
to
an
unwavering
belief
in
its
reality
but
in
the
present
instance
it
will
be
seen
immediately
that
in
the
minds
of
the
mutineers
there
was
not
even
the
shadow
of
a
basis
upon
which
to
rest
a
doubt
that
the
apparition
of
rogers
was
indeed
a
revivification
of
his
disgusting
corpse
or
at
least
its
spiritual
image
the
isolated
situation
of
the
brig
with
its
entire
inaccessibility
on
account
of
the
gale
confined
the
apparently
possible
means
of
deception
within
such
narrow
and
definite
limits
that
they
must
have
thought
themselves
enabled
to
survey
them
all
at
a
glance
they
had
now
been
at
sea
twenty-four
days
without
holding
more
than
a
speaking
communication
with
any
vessel
whatever
the
whole
of
the
crew
too--at
least
all
whom
they
had
the
most
remote
reason
for
suspecting
to
be
on
board--were
assembled
in
the
cabin
with
the
exception
of
allen
the
watch
and
his
gigantic
stature
he
was
six
feet
six
inches
high
was
too
familiar
in
their
eyes
to
permit
the
notion
that
he
was
the
apparition
before
them
to
enter
their
minds
even
for
an
instant
add
to
these
considerations
the
awe-inspiring
nature
of
the
tempest
and
that
of
the
conversation
brought
about
by
peters
the
deep
impression
which
the
loathsomeness
of
the
actual
corpse
had
made
in
the
morning
upon
the
imaginations
of
the
men
the
excellence
of
the
imitation
in
my
person
and
the
uncertain
and
wavering
light
in
which
they
beheld
me
as
the
glare
of
the
cabin
lantern
swinging
violently
to
and
fro
fell
dubiously
and
fitfully
upon
my
figure
and
there
will
be
no
reason
to
wonder
that
the
deception
had
even
more
than
the
entire
effect
which
we
had
anticipated
the
mate
sprang
up
from
the
mattress
on
which
he
was
lying
and
without
uttering
a
syllable
fell
back
stone
dead
upon
the
cabin
floor
and
was
hurled
to
the
leeward
like
a
log
by
a
heavy
roll
of
the
brig
of
the
remaining
seven
there
were
but
three
who
had
at
first
any
degree
of
presence
of
mind
the
four
others
sat
for
some
time
rooted
apparently
to
the
floor
the
most
pitiable
objects
of
horror
and
utter
despair
my
eyes
ever
encountered
the
only
opposition
we
experienced
at
all
was
from
the
cook
john
hunt
and
richard
parker
but
they
made
but
a
feeble
and
irresolute
defence
the
two
former
were
shot
instantly
by
peters
and
i
felled
parker
with
a
blow
on
the
head
from
the
pump-handle
which
i
had
brought
with
me
in
the
meantime
augustus
seized
one
of
the
muskets
lying
on
the
floor
and
shot
another
mutineer
wilson
through
the
breast
there
were
now
but
three
remaining
but
by
this
time
they
had
become
aroused
from
their
lethargy
and
perhaps
began
to
see
that
a
deception
had
been
practised
upon
them
for
they
fought
with
great
resolution
and
fury
and
but
for
the
immense
muscular
strength
of
peters
might
have
ultimately
got
the
better
of
us
these
three
men
were--jones
greely
and
absolom
hicks
jones
had
thrown
augustus
to
the
floor
stabbed
him
in
several
places
along
the
right
arm
and
would
no
doubt
have
soon
dispatched
him
as
neither
peters
nor
myself
could
immediately
get
rid
of
our
own
antagonists
had
it
not
been
for
the
timely
aid
of
a
friend
upon
whose
assistance
we
surely
had
never
depended
this
friend
was
no
other
than
tiger
with
a
low
growl
he
bounded
into
the
cabin
at
a
most
critical
moment
for
augustus
and
throwing
himself
upon
jones
pinned
him
to
the
floor
in
an
instant
my
friend
however
was
now
too
much
injured
to
render
us
any
aid
whatever
and
i
was
so
encumbered
with
my
disguise
that
i
could
do
but
little
the
dog
would
not
leave
his
hold
upon
the
throat
of
jones--peters
nevertheless
was
far
more
than
a
match
for
the
two
men
who
remained
and
would
no
doubt
have
dispatched
them
sooner
had
it
not
been
for
the
narrow
space
in
which
he
had
to
act
and
the
tremendous
lurches
of
the
vessel
presently
he
was
enabled
to
get
hold
of
a
heavy
stool
several
of
which
lay
about
the
floor
with
this
he
beat
out
the
brains
of
greely
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
discharging
a
musket
at
me
and
immediately
afterward
a
roll
of
the
brig
throwing
him
in
contact
with
hicks
he
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
by
dint
of
sheer
strength
strangled
him
instantaneously
thus
in
far
less
time
than
i
have
taken
to
tell
it
we
found
ourselves
masters
of
the
brig
the
only
person
of
our
opponents
who
was
left
alive
was
richard
parker
this
man
it
will
be
remembered
i
had
knocked
down
with
a
blow
from
the
pump-handle
at
the
commencement
of
the
attack
he
now
lay
motionless
by
the
door
of
the
shattered
stateroom
but
upon
peters
touching
him
with
his
foot
he
spoke
and
entreated
for
mercy
his
head
was
only
slightly
cut
and
otherwise
he
had
received
no
injury
having
been
merely
stunned
by
the
blow
he
now
got
up
and
for
the
present
we
secured
his
hands
behind
his
back
the
dog
was
still
growling
over
jones
but
upon
examination
we
found
him
completely
dead
the
blood
issuing
in
a
stream
from
a
deep
wound
in
the
throat
inflicted
no
doubt
by
the
sharp
teeth
of
the
animal
it
was
now
about
one
oâ€™clock
in
the
morning
and
the
wind
was
still
blowing
tremendously
the
brig
evidently
laboured
much
more
than
usual
and
it
became
absolutely
necessary
that
something
should
be
done
with
a
view
of
easing
her
in
some
measure
at
almost
every
roll
to
leeward
she
shipped
a
sea
several
of
which
came
partially
down
into
the
cabin
during
our
scuffle
the
hatchway
having
been
left
open
by
myself
when
i
descended
the
entire
range
of
bulwarks
to
larboard
had
been
swept
away
as
well
as
the
caboose
together
with
the
jollyboat
from
the
counter
the
creaking
and
working
of
the
mainmast
too
gave
indication
that
it
was
nearly
sprung
to
make
room
for
more
stowage
in
the
afterhold
the
heel
of
this
mast
had
been
stepped
between
decks
a
very
reprehensible
practice
occasionally
resorted
to
by
ignorant
ship-builders
so
that
it
was
in
imminent
danger
of
working
from
its
step
but
to
crown
all
our
difficulties
we
plummed
the
well
and
found
no
less
than
seven
feet
of
water
leaving
the
bodies
of
the
crew
lying
in
the
cabin
we
got
to
work
immediately
at
the
pumps--parker
of
course
being
set
at
liberty
to
assist
us
in
the
labour
augustusâ€™s
arm
was
bound
up
as
well
as
we
could
effect
it
and
he
did
what
he
could
but
that
was
not
much
however
we
found
that
we
could
just
manage
to
keep
the
leak
from
gaining
upon
us
by
having
one
pump
constantly
going
as
there
were
only
four
of
us
this
was
severe
labour
but
we
endeavoured
to
keep
up
our
spirits
and
looked
anxiously
for
daybreak
when
we
hoped
to
lighten
the
brig
by
cutting
away
the
mainmast
in
this
manner
we
passed
a
night
of
terrible
anxiety
and
fatigue
and
when
the
day
at
length
broke
the
gale
had
neither
abated
in
the
least
nor
were
there
any
signs
of
its
abating
we
now
dragged
the
bodies
on
deck
and
threw
them
overboard
our
next
care
was
to
get
rid
of
the
mainmast
the
necessary
preparations
having
been
made
peters
cut
away
at
the
mast
having
found
axes
in
the
cabin
while
the
rest
of
us
stood
by
the
stays
and
lanyards
as
the
brig
gave
a
tremendous
lee-lurch
the
word
was
given
to
cut
away
the
weather-lanyards
which
being
done
the
whole
mass
of
wood
and
rigging
plunged
into
the
sea
clear
of
the
brig
and
without
doing
any
material
injury
we
now
found
that
the
vessel
did
not
labour
quite
as
much
as
before
but
our
situation
was
still
exceedingly
precarious
and
in
spite
of
the
utmost
exertions
we
could
not
gain
upon
the
leak
without
the
aid
of
both
pumps
the
little
assistance
which
augustus
could
render
us
was
not
really
of
any
importance
to
add
to
our
distress
a
heavy
sea
striking
the
brig
to
the
windward
threw
her
off
several
points
from
the
wind
and
before
she
could
regain
her
position
another
broke
completely
over
her
and
hurled
her
full
upon
her
beam-ends
the
ballast
now
shifted
in
a
mass
to
leeward
the
stowage
had
been
knocking
about
perfectly
at
random
for
some
time
and
for
a
few
moments
we
thought
nothing
could
save
us
from
capsizing
presently
however
we
partially
righted
but
the
ballast
still
retaining
its
place
to
larboard
we
lay
so
much
along
that
it
was
useless
to
think
of
working
the
pumps
which
indeed
we
could
not
have
done
much
longer
in
any
case
as
our
hands
were
entirely
raw
with
the
excessive
labour
we
had
undergone
and
were
bleeding
in
the
most
horrible
manner
contrary
to
parkerâ€™s
advice
we
now
proceeded
to
cut
away
the
foremast
and
at
length
accomplished
it
after
much
difficulty
owing
to
the
position
in
which
we
lay
in
going
overboard
the
wreck
took
with
it
the
bowsprit
and
left
us
a
complete
hulk
so
far
we
had
had
reason
to
rejoice
in
the
escape
of
our
longboat
which
had
received
no
damage
from
any
of
the
huge
seas
which
had
come
on
board
but
we
had
not
long
to
congratulate
ourselves
for
the
foremast
having
gone
and
of
course
the
foresail
with
it
by
which
the
brig
had
been
steadied
every
sea
now
made
a
complete
breach
over
us
and
in
five
minutes
our
deck
was
swept
from
stem
to
stern
the
longboat
and
starboard
bulwarks
torn
off
and
even
the
windlass
shattered
into
fragments
it
was
indeed
hardly
possible
for
us
to
be
in
a
more
pitiable
condition
at
noon
there
seemed
to
be
some
slight
appearance
of
the
galeâ€™s
abating
but
in
this
we
were
sadly
disappointed
for
it
only
lulled
for
a
few
minutes
to
blow
with
redoubled
fury
about
four
in
the
afternoon
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
stand
up
against
the
violence
of
the
blast
and
as
the
night
closed
in
upon
us
i
had
not
a
shadow
of
hope
that
the
vessel
would
hold
together
until
morning
by
midnight
we
had
settled
very
deep
in
the
water
which
was
now
up
to
the
orlop
deck
the
rudder
went
soon
afterward
the
sea
which
tore
it
away
lifting
the
after
portion
of
the
brig
entirely
from
the
water
against
which
she
thumped
in
her
descent
with
such
a
concussion
as
would
be
occasioned
by
going
ashore
we
had
all
calculated
that
the
rudder
would
hold
its
own
to
the
last
as
it
was
unusually
strong
being
rigged
as
i
have
never
seen
one
rigged
either
before
or
since
down
its
main
timber
there
ran
a
succession
of
stout
iron
hooks
and
others
in
the
same
manner
down
the
stern-post
through
these
hooks
there
extended
a
very
thick
wrought-iron
rod
the
rudder
being
thus
held
to
the
stern-post
and
swinging
freely
on
the
rod
the
tremendous
force
of
the
sea
which
tore
it
off
may
be
estimated
by
the
fact
that
the
hooks
in
the
stern-post
which
ran
entirely
through
it
being
clinched
on
the
inside
were
drawn
every
one
of
them
completely
out
of
the
solid
wood
we
had
scarcely
time
to
draw
breath
after
the
violence
of
this
shock
when
one
of
the
most
tremendous
waves
i
had
then
ever
known
broke
right
on
board
of
us
sweeping
the
companion-way
clear
off
bursting
in
the
hatchways
and
filling
every
inch
of
the
vessel
with
water
luckily
just
before
night
all
four
of
us
had
lashed
ourselves
firmly
to
the
fragments
of
the
windlass
lying
in
this
manner
as
flat
upon
the
deck
as
possible
this
precaution
alone
saved
us
from
destruction
as
it
was
we
were
all
more
or
less
stunned
by
the
immense
weight
of
water
which
tumbled
upon
us
and
which
did
not
roll
from
above
us
until
we
were
nearly
exhausted
as
soon
as
i
could
recover
breath
i
called
aloud
to
my
companions
augustus
alone
replied
saying
â€œit
is
all
over
with
us
and
may
god
have
mercy
upon
our
soulsâ€
by-and-by
both
the
others
were
enabled
to
speak
when
they
exhorted
us
to
take
courage
as
there
was
still
hope
it
being
impossible
from
the
nature
of
the
cargo
that
the
brig
could
go
down
and
there
being
every
chance
that
the
gale
would
blow
over
by
the
morning
these
words
inspired
me
with
new
life
for
strange
as
it
may
seem
although
it
was
obvious
that
a
vessel
with
a
cargo
of
empty
oil-casks
would
not
sink
i
had
been
hitherto
so
confused
in
mind
as
to
have
overlooked
this
consideration
altogether
and
the
danger
which
i
had
for
some
time
regarded
as
the
most
imminent
was
that
of
foundering
as
hope
revived
within
me
i
made
use
of
every
opportunity
to
strengthen
the
lashings
which
held
me
to
the
remains
of
the
windlass
and
in
this
occupation
i
soon
discovered
that
my
companions
were
also
busy
the
night
was
as
dark
as
it
could
possibly
be
and
the
horrible
shrieking
din
and
confusion
which
surrounded
us
it
is
useless
to
attempt
describing
our
deck
lay
level
with
the
sea
or
rather
we
were
encircled
with
a
towering
ridge
of
foam
a
portion
of
which
swept
over
us
every
instant
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
our
heads
were
not
fairly
out
of
the
water
more
than
one
second
in
three
although
we
lay
close
together
no
one
of
us
could
see
the
other
or
indeed
any
portion
of
the
brig
itself
upon
which
we
were
so
tempestuously
hurled
about
at
intervals
we
called
one
to
the
other
thus
endeavouring
to
keep
alive
hope
and
render
consolation
and
encouragement
to
such
of
us
as
stood
most
in
need
of
it
the
feeble
condition
of
augustus
made
him
an
object
of
solicitude
with
us
all
and
as
from
the
lacerated
condition
of
his
right
arm
it
must
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
secure
his
lashings
with
any
degree
of
firmness
we
were
in
momentary
expectation
of
finding
that
he
had
gone
overboard--yet
to
render
him
aid
was
a
thing
altogether
out
of
the
question
fortunately
his
station
was
more
secure
than
that
of
any
of
the
rest
of
us
for
the
upper
part
of
his
body
lying
just
beneath
a
portion
of
the
shattered
windlass
the
seas
as
they
tumbled
in
upon
him
were
greatly
broken
in
their
violence
in
any
other
situation
than
this
into
which
he
had
been
accidentally
thrown
after
having
lashed
himself
in
a
very
exposed
spot
he
must
inevitably
have
perished
before
morning
owing
to
the
brigâ€™s
lying
so
much
along
we
were
all
less
liable
to
be
washed
off
than
otherwise
would
have
been
the
case
the
heel
as
i
have
before
stated
was
to
larboard
about
one
half
of
the
deck
being
constantly
under
water
the
seas
therefore
which
struck
us
to
starboard
were
much
broken
by
the
vesselâ€™s
side
only
reaching
us
in
fragments
as
we
lay
flat
on
our
faces
while
those
which
came
from
larboard
being
what
are
called
back-water
seas
and
obtaining
little
hold
upon
us
on
account
of
our
posture
had
not
sufficient
force
to
drag
us
from
our
fastenings
in
this
frightful
situation
we
lay
until
the
day
broke
so
as
to
show
us
more
fully
the
horrors
which
surrounded
us
the
brig
was
a
mere
log
rolling
about
at
the
mercy
of
every
wave
the
gale
was
upon
the
increase
if
any
thing
blowing
indeed
a
complete
hurricane
and
there
appeared
to
us
no
earthly
prospect
of
deliverance
for
several
hours
we
held
on
in
silence
expecting
every
moment
that
our
lashings
would
either
give
way
that
the
remains
of
the
windlass
would
go
by
the
board
or
that
some
of
the
huge
seas
which
roared
in
every
direction
around
us
and
above
us
would
drive
the
hulk
so
far
beneath
the
water
that
we
should
be
drowned
before
it
could
regain
the
surface
by
the
mercy
of
god
however
we
were
preserved
from
these
imminent
dangers
and
about
midday
were
cheered
by
the
light
of
the
blessed
sun
shortly
afterward
we
could
perceive
a
sensible
diminution
in
the
force
of
the
wind
when
now
for
the
first
time
since
the
latter
part
of
the
evening
before
augustus
spoke
asking
peters
who
lay
closest
to
him
if
he
thought
there
was
any
possibility
of
our
being
saved
as
no
reply
was
at
first
made
to
this
question
we
all
concluded
that
the
hybrid
had
been
drowned
where
he
lay
but
presently
to
our
great
joy
he
spoke
although
very
feebly
saying
that
he
was
in
great
pain
being
so
cut
by
the
tightness
of
his
lashings
across
the
stomach
that
he
must
either
find
means
of
loosening
them
or
perish
as
it
was
impossible
that
he
could
endure
his
misery
much
longer
this
occasioned
us
great
distress
as
it
was
altogether
useless
to
think
of
aiding
him
in
any
manner
while
the
sea
continued
washing
over
us
as
it
did
we
exhorted
him
to
bear
his
sufferings
with
fortitude
and
promised
to
seize
the
first
opportunity
which
should
offer
itself
to
relieve
him
he
replied
that
it
would
soon
be
too
late
that
it
would
be
all
over
with
him
before
we
could
help
him
and
then
after
moaning
for
some
minutes
lay
silent
when
we
concluded
that
he
had
perished
as
the
evening
drew
on
the
sea
had
fallen
so
much
that
scarcely
more
than
one
wave
broke
over
the
hulk
from
windward
in
the
course
of
five
minutes
and
the
wind
had
abated
a
great
deal
although
still
blowing
a
severe
gale
i
had
not
heard
any
of
my
companions
speak
for
hours
and
now
called
to
augustus
he
replied
although
very
feebly
so
that
i
could
not
distinguish
what
he
said
i
then
spoke
to
peters
and
to
parker
neither
of
whom
returned
any
answer
shortly
after
this
period
i
fell
into
a
state
of
partial
insensibility
during
which
the
most
pleasing
images
floated
in
my
imagination
such
as
green
trees
waving
meadows
of
ripe
grain
processions
of
dancing
girls
troops
of
cavalry
and
other
phantasies
i
now
remember
that
in
all
which
passed
before
my
mindâ€™s
eye
motion
was
a
predominant
idea
thus
i
never
fancied
any
stationary
object
such
as
a
house
a
mountain
or
any
thing
of
that
kind
but
windmills
ships
large
birds
balloons
people
on
horseback
carriages
driving
furiously
and
similar
moving
objects
presented
themselves
in
endless
succession
when
i
recovered
from
this
state
the
sun
was
as
near
as
i
could
guess
an
hour
high
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
bringing
to
recollection
the
various
circumstances
connected
with
my
situation
and
for
some
time
remained
firmly
convinced
that
i
was
still
in
the
hold
of
the
brig
near
the
box
and
that
the
body
of
parker
was
that
of
tiger
when
i
at
length
completely
came
to
my
senses
i
found
that
the
wind
blew
no
more
than
a
moderate
breeze
and
that
the
sea
was
comparatively
calm
so
much
so
that
it
only
washed
over
the
brig
amidships
my
left
arm
had
broken
loose
from
its
lashings
and
was
much
cut
about
the
elbow
my
right
was
entirely
benumbed
and
the
hand
and
wrist
swollen
prodigiously
by
the
pressure
of
the
rope
which
had
worked
from
the
shoulder
downward
i
was
also
in
great
pain
from
another
rope
which
went
about
my
waist
and
had
been
drawn
to
an
insufferable
degree
of
tightness
looking
round
upon
my
companions
i
saw
that
peters
still
lived
although
a
thick
line
was
pulled
so
forcibly
around
his
loins
as
to
give
him
the
appearance
of
being
cut
nearly
in
two
as
i
stirred
he
made
a
feeble
motion
to
me
with
his
hand
pointing
to
the
rope
augustus
gave
no
indication
of
life
whatever
and
was
bent
nearly
double
across
a
splinter
of
the
windlass
parker
spoke
to
me
when
he
saw
me
moving
and
asked
me
if
i
had
not
sufficient
strength
to
release
him
from
his
situation
saying
that
if
i
would
summon
up
what
spirits
i
could
and
contrive
to
untie
him
we
might
yet
save
our
lives
but
that
otherwise
we
must
all
perish
i
told
him
to
take
courage
and
i
would
endeavor
to
free
him
feeling
in
my
pantaloonsâ€™
pocket
i
got
hold
of
my
penknife
and
after
several
ineffectual
attempts
at
length
succeeded
in
opening
it
i
then
with
my
left
hand
managed
to
free
my
right
from
its
fastenings
and
afterward
cut
the
other
ropes
which
held
me
upon
attempting
however
to
move
from
my
position
i
found
that
my
legs
failed
me
altogether
and
that
i
could
not
get
up
neither
could
i
move
my
right
arm
in
any
direction
upon
mentioning
this
to
parker
he
advised
me
to
lie
quiet
for
a
few
minutes
holding
on
to
the
windlass
with
my
left
hand
so
as
to
allow
time
for
the
blood
to
circulate
doing
this
the
numbness
presently
began
to
die
away
so
that
i
could
move
first
one
of
my
legs
and
then
the
other
and
shortly
afterward
i
regained
the
partial
use
of
my
right
arm
i
now
crawled
with
great
caution
toward
parker
without
getting
on
my
legs
and
soon
cut
loose
all
the
lashings
about
him
when
after
a
short
delay
he
also
recovered
the
partial
use
of
his
limbs
we
now
lost
no
time
in
getting
loose
the
rope
from
peters
it
had
cut
a
deep
gash
through
the
waistband
of
his
woollen
pantaloons
and
through
two
shirts
and
made
its
way
into
his
groin
from
which
the
blood
flowed
out
copiously
as
we
removed
the
cordage
no
sooner
had
we
removed
it
however
than
he
spoke
and
seemed
to
experience
instant
relief--being
able
to
move
with
much
greater
ease
than
either
parker
or
myself--this
was
no
doubt
owing
to
the
discharge
of
blood
we
had
little
hopes
that
augustus
would
recover
as
he
evinced
no
signs
of
life
but
upon
getting
to
him
we
discovered
that
he
had
merely
swooned
from
the
loss
of
blood
the
bandages
we
had
placed
around
his
wounded
arm
having
been
torn
off
by
the
water
none
of
the
ropes
which
held
him
to
the
windlass
were
drawn
sufficiently
tight
to
occasion
his
death
having
relieved
him
from
the
fastenings
and
got
him
clear
of
the
broken
wood
about
the
windlass
we
secured
him
in
a
dry
place
to
windward
with
his
head
somewhat
lower
than
his
body
and
all
three
of
us
busied
ourselves
in
chafing
his
limbs
in
about
half
an
hour
he
came
to
himself
although
it
was
not
until
the
next
morning
that
he
gave
signs
of
recognizing
any
of
us
or
had
sufficient
strength
to
speak
by
the
time
we
had
thus
got
clear
of
our
lashings
it
was
quite
dark
and
it
began
to
cloud
up
so
that
we
were
again
in
the
greatest
agony
lest
it
should
come
on
to
blow
hard
in
which
event
nothing
could
have
saved
us
from
perishing
exhausted
as
we
were
by
good
fortune
it
continued
very
moderate
during
the
night
the
sea
subsiding
every
minute
which
gave
us
great
hopes
of
ultimate
preservation
a
gentle
breeze
still
blew
from
the
n
w
but
the
weather
was
not
at
all
cold
augustus
was
lashed
carefully
to
windward
in
such
a
manner
as
to
prevent
him
from
slipping
overboard
with
the
rolls
of
the
vessel
as
he
was
still
too
weak
to
hold
on
at
all
for
ourselves
there
was
no
such
necessity
we
sat
close
together
supporting
each
other
with
the
aid
of
the
broken
ropes
about
the
windlass
and
devising
methods
of
escape
from
our
frightful
situation
we
derived
much
comfort
from
taking
off
our
clothes
and
wringing
the
water
from
them
when
we
put
them
on
after
this
they
felt
remarkably
warm
and
pleasant
and
served
to
invigorate
us
in
no
little
degree
we
helped
augustus
off
with
his
and
wrung
them
for
him
when
he
experienced
the
same
comfort
our
chief
sufferings
were
now
those
of
hunger
and
thirst
and
when
we
looked
forward
to
the
means
of
relief
in
this
respect
our
hearts
sunk
within
us
and
we
were
induced
to
regret
that
we
had
escaped
the
less
dreadful
perils
of
the
sea
we
endeavoured
however
to
console
ourselves
with
the
hope
of
being
speedily
picked
up
by
some
vessel
and
encouraged
each
other
to
bear
with
fortitude
the
evils
that
might
happen
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
at
length
dawned
and
the
weather
still
continued
clear
and
pleasant
with
a
steady
but
very
light
breeze
from
the
n
w
the
sea
was
now
quite
smooth
and
as
from
some
cause
which
we
could
not
determine
the
brig
did
not
lie
so
much
along
as
she
had
done
before
the
deck
was
comparatively
dry
and
we
could
move
about
with
freedom
we
had
now
been
better
than
three
entire
days
and
nights
without
either
food
or
drink
and
it
became
absolutely
necessary
that
we
should
make
an
attempt
to
get
up
something
from
below
as
the
brig
was
completely
full
of
water
we
went
to
this
work
despondently
and
with
but
little
expectation
of
being
able
to
obtain
anything
we
made
a
kind
of
drag
by
driving
some
nails
which
we
broke
out
from
the
remains
of
the
companion-hatch
into
two
pieces
of
wood
tying
these
across
each
other
and
fastening
them
to
the
end
of
a
rope
we
threw
them
into
the
cabin
and
dragged
them
to
and
fro
in
the
faint
hope
of
being
thus
able
to
entangle
some
article
which
might
be
of
use
to
us
for
food
or
which
might
at
least
render
us
assistance
in
getting
it
we
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
in
this
labour
without
effect
fishing
up
nothing
more
than
a
few
bedclothes
which
were
readily
caught
by
the
nails
indeed
our
contrivance
was
so
very
clumsy
that
any
greater
success
was
hardly
to
be
anticipated
we
now
tried
the
forecastle
but
equally
in
vain
and
were
upon
the
brink
of
despair
when
peters
proposed
that
we
should
fasten
a
rope
to
his
body
and
let
him
make
an
attempt
to
get
up
something
by
diving
into
the
cabin
this
proposition
we
hailed
with
all
the
delight
which
reviving
hope
could
inspire
he
proceeded
immediately
to
strip
off
his
clothes
with
the
exception
of
his
pantaloons
and
a
strong
rope
was
then
carefully
fastened
around
his
middle
being
brought
up
over
his
shoulders
in
such
a
manner
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
its
slipping
the
undertaking
was
one
of
great
difficulty
and
danger
for
as
we
could
hardly
expect
to
find
much
if
any
provision
in
the
cabin
itself
it
was
necessary
that
the
diver
after
letting
himself
down
should
make
a
turn
to
the
right
and
proceed
under
water
a
distance
of
ten
or
twelve
feet
in
a
narrow
passage
to
the
storeroom
and
return
without
drawing
breath
everything
being
ready
peters
now
descended
in
the
cabin
going
down
the
companion-ladder
until
the
water
reached
his
chin
he
then
plunged
in
head
first
turning
to
the
right
as
he
plunged
and
endeavouring
to
make
his
way
to
the
storeroom
in
this
first
attempt
however
he
was
altogether
unsuccessful
in
less
than
half
a
minute
after
his
going
down
we
felt
the
rope
jerked
violently
the
signal
we
had
agreed
upon
when
he
desired
to
be
drawn
up
we
accordingly
drew
him
up
instantly
but
so
incautiously
as
to
bruise
him
badly
against
the
ladder
he
had
brought
nothing
with
him
and
had
been
unable
to
penetrate
more
than
a
very
little
way
into
the
passage
owing
to
the
constant
exertions
he
found
it
necessary
to
make
in
order
to
keep
himself
from
floating
up
against
the
deck
upon
getting
out
he
was
very
much
exhausted
and
had
to
rest
full
fifteen
minutes
before
he
could
again
venture
to
descend
the
second
attempt
met
with
even
worse
success
for
he
remained
so
long
under
water
without
giving
the
signal
that
becoming
alarmed
for
his
safety
we
drew
him
out
without
it
and
found
that
he
was
almost
at
the
last
gasp
having
as
he
said
repeatedly
jerked
at
the
rope
without
our
feeling
it
this
was
probably
owing
to
a
portion
of
it
having
become
entangled
in
the
balustrade
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
this
balustrade
was
indeed
so
much
in
the
way
that
we
determined
to
remove
it
if
possible
before
proceeding
with
our
design
as
we
had
no
means
of
getting
it
away
except
by
main
force
we
all
descended
into
the
water
as
far
as
we
could
on
the
ladder
and
giving
a
pull
against
it
with
our
united
strength
succeeded
in
breaking
it
down
the
third
attempt
was
equally
unsuccessful
with
the
two
first
and
it
now
became
evident
that
nothing
could
be
done
in
this
manner
without
the
aid
of
some
weight
with
which
the
diver
might
steady
himself
and
keep
to
the
floor
of
the
cabin
while
making
his
search
for
a
long
time
we
looked
about
in
vain
for
something
which
might
answer
this
purpose
but
at
length
to
our
great
joy
we
discovered
one
of
the
weather-forechains
so
loose
that
we
had
not
the
least
difficulty
in
wrenching
it
off
having
fastened
this
securely
to
one
of
his
ankles
peters
now
made
his
fourth
descent
into
the
cabin
and
this
time
succeeded
in
making
his
way
to
the
door
of
the
stewardâ€™s
room
to
his
inexpressible
grief
however
he
found
it
locked
and
was
obliged
to
return
without
effecting
an
entrance
as
with
the
greatest
exertion
he
could
remain
under
water
not
more
at
the
utmost
extent
than
a
single
minute
our
affairs
now
looked
gloomy
indeed
and
neither
augustus
nor
myself
could
refrain
from
bursting
into
tears
as
we
thought
of
the
host
of
difficulties
which
encompassed
us
and
the
slight
probability
which
existed
of
our
finally
making
an
escape
but
this
weakness
was
not
of
long
duration
throwing
ourselves
on
our
knees
to
god
we
implored
his
aid
in
the
many
dangers
which
beset
us
and
arose
with
renewed
hope
and
vigor
to
think
what
could
yet
be
done
by
mortal
means
toward
accomplishing
our
deliverance
shortly
afterward
an
incident
occurred
which
i
am
induced
to
look
upon
as
more
intensely
productive
of
emotion
as
far
more
replete
with
the
extremes
first
of
delight
and
then
of
horror
than
even
any
of
the
thousand
chances
which
afterward
befell
me
in
nine
long
years
crowded
with
events
of
the
most
startling
and
in
many
cases
of
the
most
unconceived
and
unconceivable
character
we
were
lying
on
the
deck
near
the
companion-way
and
debating
the
possibility
of
yet
making
our
way
into
the
storeroom
when
looking
toward
augustus
who
lay
fronting
myself
i
perceived
that
he
had
become
all
at
once
deadly
pale
and
that
his
lips
were
quivering
in
the
most
singular
and
unaccountable
manner
greatly
alarmed
i
spoke
to
him
but
he
made
me
no
reply
and
i
was
beginning
to
think
that
he
was
suddenly
taken
ill
when
i
took
notice
of
his
eyes
which
were
glaring
apparently
at
some
object
behind
me
i
turned
my
head
and
shall
never
forget
the
ecstatic
joy
which
thrilled
through
every
particle
of
my
frame
when
i
perceived
a
large
brig
bearing
down
upon
us
and
not
more
than
a
couple
of
miles
off
i
sprung
to
my
feet
as
if
a
musket
bullet
had
suddenly
struck
me
to
the
heart
and
stretching
out
my
arms
in
the
direction
of
the
vessel
stood
in
this
manner
motionless
and
unable
to
articulate
a
syllable
peters
and
parker
were
equally
affected
although
in
different
ways
the
former
danced
about
the
deck
like
a
madman
uttering
the
most
extravagant
rhodomontades
intermingled
with
howls
and
imprecations
while
the
latter
burst
into
tears
and
continued
for
many
minutes
weeping
like
a
child
the
vessel
in
sight
was
a
large
hermaphrodite
brig
of
a
dutch
build
and
painted
black
with
a
tawdry
gilt
figure-head
she
had
evidently
seen
a
good
deal
of
rough
weather
and
we
supposed
had
suffered
much
in
the
gale
which
had
proved
so
disastrous
to
ourselves
for
her
foretopmast
was
gone
and
some
of
her
starboard
bulwarks
when
we
first
saw
her
she
was
as
i
have
already
said
about
two
miles
off
and
to
windward
bearing
down
upon
us
the
breeze
was
very
gentle
and
what
astonished
us
chiefly
was
that
she
had
no
other
sails
set
than
her
foremast
and
mainsail
with
a
flying
jib--of
course
she
came
down
but
slowly
and
our
impatience
amounted
nearly
to
phrensy
the
awkward
manner
in
which
she
steered
too
was
remarked
by
all
of
us
even
excited
as
we
were
she
yawed
about
so
considerably
that
once
or
twice
we
thought
it
impossible
she
could
see
us
or
imagined
that
having
seen
us
and
discovered
no
person
on
board
she
was
about
to
tack
and
make
off
in
another
direction
upon
each
of
these
occasions
we
screamed
and
shouted
at
the
top
of
our
voices
when
the
stranger
would
appear
to
change
for
a
moment
her
intention
and
again
hold
on
toward
us--this
singular
conduct
being
repeated
two
or
three
times
so
that
at
last
we
could
think
of
no
other
manner
of
accounting
for
it
than
by
supposing
the
helmsman
to
be
in
liquor
no
person
was
seen
upon
her
decks
until
she
arrived
within
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
us
we
then
saw
three
seamen
whom
by
their
dress
we
took
to
be
hollanders
two
of
these
were
lying
on
some
old
sails
near
the
forecastle
and
the
third
who
appeared
to
be
looking
at
us
with
great
curiosity
was
leaning
over
the
starboard
bow
near
the
bowsprit
this
last
was
a
stout
and
tall
man
with
a
very
dark
skin
he
seemed
by
his
manner
to
be
encouraging
us
to
have
patience
nodding
to
us
in
a
cheerful
although
rather
odd
way
and
smiling
constantly
so
as
to
display
a
set
of
the
most
brilliantly
white
teeth
as
his
vessel
drew
nearer
we
saw
a
red
flannel
cap
which
he
had
on
fall
from
his
head
into
the
water
but
of
this
he
took
little
or
no
notice
continuing
his
odd
smiles
and
gesticulations
i
relate
these
things
and
circumstances
minutely
and
i
relate
them
it
must
be
understood
precisely
as
they
appeared
to
us
the
brig
came
on
slowly
and
now
more
steadily
than
before
and--i
cannot
speak
calmly
of
this
event--our
hearts
leaped
up
wildly
within
us
and
we
poured
out
our
whole
souls
in
shouts
and
thanksgiving
to
god
for
the
complete
unexpected
and
glorious
deliverance
that
was
so
palpably
at
hand
of
a
sudden
and
all
at
once
there
came
wafted
over
the
ocean
from
the
strange
vessel
which
was
now
close
upon
us
a
smell
a
stench
such
as
the
whole
world
has
no
name
for--no
conception
of--hellish--utterly
suffocating--insufferable
inconceivable
i
gasped
for
breath
and
turning
to
my
companions
perceived
that
they
were
paler
than
marble
but
we
had
now
no
time
left
for
question
or
surmise--the
brig
was
within
fifty
feet
of
us
and
it
seemed
to
be
her
intention
to
run
under
our
counter
that
we
might
board
her
without
putting
out
a
boat
we
rushed
aft
when
suddenly
a
wide
yaw
threw
her
off
full
five
or
six
points
from
the
course
she
had
been
running
and
as
she
passed
under
our
stern
at
the
distance
of
about
twenty
feet
we
had
a
full
view
of
her
decks
shall
i
ever
forget
the
triple
horror
of
that
spectacle
twenty-five
or
thirty
human
bodies
among
whom
were
several
females
lay
scattered
about
between
the
counter
and
the
galley
in
the
last
and
most
loathsome
state
of
putrefaction
we
plainly
saw
that
not
a
soul
lived
in
that
fated
vessel
yet
we
could
not
help
shouting
to
the
dead
for
help
yes
long
and
loudly
did
we
beg
in
the
agony
of
the
moment
that
those
silent
and
disgusting
images
would
stay
for
us
would
not
abandon
us
to
become
like
them
would
receive
us
among
their
goodly
company
we
were
raving
with
horror
and
despair--thoroughly
mad
through
the
anguish
of
our
grievous
disappointment
as
our
first
loud
yell
of
terror
broke
forth
it
was
replied
to
by
something
from
near
the
bowsprit
of
the
stranger
so
closely
resembling
the
scream
of
a
human
voice
that
the
nicest
ear
might
have
been
startled
and
deceived
at
this
instant
another
sudden
yaw
brought
the
region
of
the
forecastle
for
a
moment
into
view
and
we
beheld
at
once
the
origin
of
the
sound
we
saw
the
tall
stout
figure
still
leaning
on
the
bulwark
and
still
nodding
his
head
to
and
fro
but
his
face
was
now
turned
from
us
so
that
we
could
not
behold
it
his
arms
were
extended
over
the
rail
and
the
palms
of
his
hands
fell
outward
his
knees
were
lodged
upon
a
stout
rope
tightly
stretched
and
reaching
from
the
heel
of
the
bowsprit
to
a
cathead
on
his
back
from
which
a
portion
of
the
shirt
had
been
torn
leaving
it
bare
there
sat
a
huge
sea-gull
busily
gorging
itself
with
the
horrible
flesh
its
bill
and
talons
deep
buried
and
its
white
plumage
spattered
all
over
with
blood
as
the
brig
moved
farther
round
so
as
to
bring
us
close
in
view
the
bird
with
much
apparent
difficulty
drew
out
its
crimsoned
head
and
after
eyeing
us
for
a
moment
as
if
stupefied
arose
lazily
from
the
body
upon
which
it
had
been
feasting
and
flying
directly
above
our
deck
hovered
there
a
while
with
a
portion
of
clotted
and
liver-like
substance
in
its
beak
the
horrid
morsel
dropped
at
length
with
a
sullen
splash
immediately
at
the
feet
of
parker
may
god
forgive
me
but
now
for
the
first
time
there
flashed
through
my
mind
a
thought
a
thought
which
i
will
not
mention
and
i
felt
myself
making
a
step
toward
the
ensanguined
spot
i
looked
upward
and
the
eyes
of
augustus
met
my
own
with
a
degree
of
intense
and
eager
meaning
which
immediately
brought
me
to
my
senses
i
sprang
forward
quickly
and
with
a
deep
shudder
threw
the
frightful
thing
into
the
sea
the
body
from
which
it
had
been
taken
resting
as
it
did
upon
the
rope
had
been
easily
swayed
to
and
fro
by
the
exertions
of
the
carnivorous
bird
and
it
was
this
motion
which
had
at
first
impressed
us
with
the
belief
of
its
being
alive
as
the
gull
relieved
it
of
its
weight
it
swung
round
and
fell
partially
over
so
that
the
face
was
fully
discovered
never
surely
was
any
object
so
terribly
full
of
awe
the
eyes
were
gone
and
the
whole
flesh
around
the
mouth
leaving
the
teeth
utterly
naked
this
then
was
the
smile
which
had
cheered
us
on
to
hope
this
the--but
i
forbear
the
brig
as
i
have
already
told
passed
under
our
stern
and
made
its
way
slowly
but
steadily
to
leeward
with
her
and
with
her
terrible
crew
went
all
our
gay
visions
of
deliverance
and
joy
deliberately
as
she
went
by
we
might
possibly
have
found
means
of
boarding
her
had
not
our
sudden
disappointment
and
the
appalling
nature
of
the
discovery
which
accompanied
it
laid
entirely
prostrate
every
active
faculty
of
mind
and
body
we
had
seen
and
felt
but
we
could
neither
think
nor
act
until
alas
too
late
how
much
our
intellects
had
been
weakened
by
this
incident
may
be
estimated
by
the
fact
that
when
the
vessel
had
proceeded
so
far
that
we
could
perceive
no
more
than
the
half
of
her
hull
the
proposition
was
seriously
entertained
of
attempting
to
overtake
her
by
swimming
i
have
since
this
period
vainly
endeavoured
to
obtain
some
clew
to
the
hideous
uncertainty
which
enveloped
the
fate
of
the
stranger
her
build
and
general
appearance
as
i
have
before
stated
led
us
to
the
belief
that
she
was
a
dutch
trader
and
the
dresses
of
the
crew
also
sustained
this
opinion
we
might
have
easily
seen
the
name
upon
her
stern
and
indeed
taken
other
observations
which
would
have
guided
us
in
making
out
her
character
but
the
intense
excitement
of
the
moment
blinded
us
to
every
thing
of
that
nature
from
the
saffron-like
hue
of
such
of
the
corpses
as
were
not
entirely
decayed
we
concluded
that
the
whole
of
her
company
had
perished
by
the
yellow
fever
or
some
other
virulent
disease
of
the
same
fearful
kind
if
such
were
the
case
and
i
know
not
what
else
to
imagine
death
to
judge
from
the
positions
of
the
bodies
must
have
come
upon
them
in
a
manner
awfully
sudden
and
overwhelming
in
a
way
totally
distinct
from
that
which
generally
characterizes
even
the
most
deadly
pestilences
with
which
mankind
are
acquainted
it
is
possible
indeed
that
poison
accidentally
introduced
into
some
of
their
sea-stores
may
have
brought
about
the
disaster
or
that
the
eating
of
some
unknown
venomous
species
of
fish
or
other
marine
animal
or
oceanic
bird
might
have
induced
it--but
it
is
utterly
useless
to
form
conjectures
where
all
is
involved
and
will
no
doubt
remain
for
ever
involved
in
the
most
appalling
and
unfathomable
mystery
we
spent
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
a
condition
of
stupid
lethargy
gazing
after
the
retreating
vessel
until
the
darkness
hiding
her
from
our
sight
recalled
us
in
some
measure
to
our
senses
the
pangs
of
hunger
and
thirst
then
returned
absorbing
all
other
cares
and
considerations
nothing
however
could
be
done
until
the
morning
and
securing
ourselves
as
well
as
possible
we
endeavoured
to
snatch
a
little
repose
in
this
i
succeeded
beyond
my
expectations
sleeping
until
my
companions
who
had
not
been
so
fortunate
aroused
me
at
daybreak
to
renew
our
attempts
at
getting
up
provisions
from
the
hull
it
was
now
a
dead
calm
with
the
sea
as
smooth
as
i
have
ever
known
it--the
weather
warm
and
pleasant
the
brig
was
out
of
sight
we
commenced
our
operations
by
wrenching
off
with
some
trouble
another
of
the
forechains
and
having
fastened
both
to
petersâ€™
feet
he
again
made
an
endeavour
to
reach
the
door
of
the
storeroom
thinking
it
possible
that
he
might
be
able
to
force
it
open
provided
he
could
get
at
it
in
sufficient
time
and
this
he
hoped
to
do
as
the
hulk
lay
much
more
steadily
than
before
he
succeeded
very
quickly
in
reaching
the
door
when
loosening
one
of
the
chains
from
his
ankle
he
made
every
exertion
to
force
the
passage
with
it
but
in
vain
the
framework
of
the
room
being
far
stronger
than
was
anticipated
he
was
quite
exhausted
with
his
long
stay
under
water
and
it
became
absolutely
necessary
that
some
other
one
of
us
should
take
his
place
for
this
service
parker
immediately
volunteered
but
after
making
three
ineffectual
efforts
found
that
he
could
never
even
succeed
in
getting
near
the
door
the
condition
of
augustusâ€™s
wounded
arm
rendered
it
useless
for
him
to
attempt
going
down
as
he
would
be
unable
to
force
the
room
open
should
he
reach
it
and
it
accordingly
now
devolved
upon
me
to
exert
myself
for
our
common
deliverance
peters
had
left
one
of
the
chains
in
the
passage
and
i
found
upon
plunging
in
that
i
had
not
sufficient
balance
to
keep
me
firmly
down
i
determined
therefore
to
attempt
no
more
in
my
first
effort
than
merely
to
recover
the
other
chain
in
groping
along
the
floor
of
the
passage
for
this
i
felt
a
hard
substance
which
i
immediately
grasped
not
having
time
to
ascertain
what
it
was
but
returning
and
ascending
instantly
to
the
surface
the
prize
proved
to
be
a
bottle
and
our
joy
may
be
conceived
when
i
say
that
it
was
found
to
be
full
of
port
wine
giving
thanks
to
god
for
this
timely
and
cheering
assistance
we
immediately
drew
the
cork
with
my
penknife
and
each
taking
a
moderate
sup
felt
the
most
indescribable
comfort
from
the
warmth
strength
and
spirits
with
which
it
inspired
us
we
then
carefully
recorked
the
bottle
and
by
means
of
a
handkerchief
swung
it
in
such
a
manner
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
its
getting
broken
having
rested
a
while
after
this
fortunate
discovery
i
again
descended
and
now
recovered
the
chain
with
which
i
instantly
came
up
i
then
fastened
it
on
and
went
down
for
the
third
time
when
i
became
fully
satisfied
that
no
exertions
whatever
in
that
situation
would
enable
me
to
force
open
the
door
of
the
storeroom
i
therefore
returned
in
despair
there
seemed
now
to
be
no
longer
any
room
for
hope
and
i
could
perceive
in
the
countenances
of
my
companions
that
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
perish
the
wine
had
evidently
produced
in
them
a
species
of
delirium
which
perhaps
i
had
been
prevented
from
feeling
by
the
immersion
i
had
undergone
since
drinking
it
they
talked
incoherently
and
about
matters
unconnected
with
our
condition
peters
repeatedly
asking
me
questions
about
nantucket
augustus
too
i
remember
approached
me
with
a
serious
air
and
requested
me
to
lend
him
a
pocket-comb
as
his
hair
was
full
of
fish-scales
and
he
wished
to
get
them
out
before
going
on
shore
parker
appeared
somewhat
less
affected
and
urged
me
to
dive
at
random
into
the
cabin
and
bring
up
any
article
which
might
come
to
hand
to
this
i
consented
and
in
the
first
attempt
after
staying
under
a
full
minute
brought
up
a
small
leather
trunk
belonging
to
captain
barnard
this
was
immediately
opened
in
the
faint
hope
that
it
might
contain
something
to
eat
or
drink
we
found
nothing
however
except
a
box
of
razors
and
two
linen
shirts
i
now
went
down
again
and
returned
without
any
success
as
my
head
came
above
water
i
heard
a
crash
on
deck
and
upon
getting
up
saw
that
my
companions
had
ungratefully
taken
advantage
of
my
absence
to
drink
the
remainder
of
the
wine
having
let
the
bottle
fall
in
the
endeavour
to
replace
it
before
i
saw
them
i
remonstrated
with
them
on
the
heartlessness
of
their
conduct
when
augustus
burst
into
tears
the
other
two
endeavoured
to
laugh
the
matter
off
as
a
joke
but
i
hope
never
again
to
behold
laughter
of
such
a
species
the
distortion
of
countenance
was
absolutely
frightful
indeed
it
was
apparent
that
the
stimulus
in
the
empty
state
of
their
stomachs
had
taken
instant
and
violent
effect
and
that
they
were
all
exceedingly
intoxicated
with
great
difficulty
i
prevailed
upon
them
to
lie
down
when
they
fell
very
soon
into
a
heavy
slumber
accompanied
with
loud
stertorous
breathing
i
now
found
myself
as
it
were
alone
in
the
brig
and
my
reflections
to
be
sure
were
of
the
most
fearful
and
gloomy
nature
no
prospect
offered
itself
to
my
view
but
a
lingering
death
by
famine
or
at
the
best
by
being
overwhelmed
in
the
first
gale
which
should
spring
up
for
in
our
present
exhausted
condition
we
could
have
no
hope
of
living
through
another
the
gnawing
hunger
which
i
now
experienced
was
nearly
insupportable
and
i
felt
myself
capable
of
going
to
any
lengths
in
order
to
appease
it
with
my
knife
i
cut
off
a
small
portion
of
the
leather
trunk
and
endeavoured
to
eat
it
but
found
it
utterly
impossible
to
swallow
a
single
morsel
although
i
fancied
that
some
little
alleviation
of
my
suffering
was
obtained
by
chewing
small
pieces
of
it
and
spitting
them
out
toward
night
my
companions
awoke
one
by
one
each
in
an
indescribable
state
of
weakness
and
horror
brought
on
by
the
wine
whose
fumes
had
now
evaporated
they
shook
as
if
with
a
violent
ague
and
uttered
the
most
lamentable
cries
for
water
their
condition
affected
me
in
the
most
lively
degree
at
the
same
time
causing
me
to
rejoice
in
the
fortunate
train
of
circumstances
which
had
prevented
me
from
indulging
in
the
wine
and
consequently
from
sharing
their
melancholy
and
most
distressing
sensations
their
conduct
however
gave
me
great
uneasiness
and
alarm
for
it
was
evident
that
unless
some
favourable
change
took
place
they
could
afford
me
no
assistance
in
providing
for
our
common
safety
i
had
not
yet
abandoned
all
idea
of
being
able
to
get
up
something
from
below
but
the
attempt
could
not
possibly
be
resumed
until
some
one
of
them
was
sufficiently
master
of
himself
to
aid
me
by
holding
the
end
of
the
rope
while
i
went
down
parker
appeared
to
be
somewhat
more
in
possession
of
his
senses
than
the
others
and
i
endeavoured
by
every
means
in
my
power
to
rouse
him
thinking
that
a
plunge
in
the
sea-water
might
have
a
beneficial
effect
i
contrived
to
fasten
the
end
of
a
rope
around
his
body
and
then
leading
him
to
the
companion-way
he
remaining
quite
passive
all
the
while
pushed
him
in
and
immediately
drew
him
out
i
had
good
reason
to
congratulate
myself
upon
having
made
this
experiment
for
he
appeared
much
revived
and
invigorated
and
upon
getting
out
asked
me
in
a
rational
manner
why
i
had
so
served
him
having
explained
my
object
he
expressed
himself
indebted
to
me
and
said
that
he
felt
greatly
better
from
the
immersion
afterward
conversing
sensibly
upon
our
situation
we
then
resolved
to
treat
augustus
and
peters
in
the
same
way
which
we
immediately
did
when
they
both
experienced
much
benefit
from
the
shock
this
idea
of
sudden
immersion
had
been
suggested
to
me
by
reading
in
some
medical
work
the
good
effect
of
the
shower-bath
in
a
case
where
the
patient
was
suffering
from
mania
a
potu
finding
that
i
could
now
trust
my
companions
to
hold
the
end
of
the
rope
i
again
made
three
or
four
plunges
into
the
cabin
although
it
was
now
quite
dark
and
a
gentle
but
long
swell
from
the
northward
rendered
the
hulk
somewhat
unsteady
in
the
course
of
these
attempts
i
succeeded
in
bringing
up
two
case-knives
a
three-gallon
jug
empty
and
a
blanket
but
nothing
which
could
serve
us
for
food
i
continued
my
efforts
after
getting
these
articles
until
i
was
completely
exhausted
but
brought
up
nothing
else
during
the
night
parker
and
peters
occupied
themselves
by
turns
in
the
same
manner
but
nothing
coming
to
hand
we
now
gave
up
this
attempt
in
despair
concluding
that
we
were
exhausting
ourselves
in
vain
we
passed
the
remainder
of
this
night
in
a
state
of
the
most
intense
mental
and
bodily
anguish
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
the
morning
of
the
sixteenth
at
length
dawned
and
we
looked
eagerly
around
the
horizon
for
relief
but
to
no
purpose
the
sea
was
still
smooth
with
only
a
long
swell
from
the
northward
as
on
yesterday
this
was
the
sixth
day
since
we
had
tasted
either
food
or
drink
with
the
exception
of
the
bottle
of
port
wine
and
it
was
clear
that
we
could
hold
out
but
a
very
little
while
longer
unless
something
could
be
obtained
i
never
saw
before
nor
wish
to
see
again
human
beings
so
utterly
emaciated
as
peters
and
augustus
had
i
met
them
on
shore
in
their
present
condition
i
should
not
have
had
the
slightest
suspicion
that
i
had
ever
beheld
them
their
countenances
were
totally
changed
in
character
so
that
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
believe
them
really
the
same
individuals
with
whom
i
had
been
in
company
but
a
few
days
before
parker
although
sadly
reduced
and
so
feeble
that
he
could
not
raise
his
head
from
his
bosom
was
not
so
far
gone
as
the
other
two
he
suffered
with
great
patience
making
no
complaint
and
endeavouring
to
inspire
us
with
hope
in
every
manner
he
could
devise
for
myself
although
at
the
commencement
of
the
voyage
i
had
been
in
bad
health
and
was
at
all
times
of
a
delicate
constitution
i
suffered
less
than
any
of
us
being
much
less
reduced
in
frame
and
retaining
my
powers
of
mind
in
a
surprising
degree
while
the
rest
were
completely
prostrated
in
intellect
and
seemed
to
be
brought
to
a
species
of
second
childhood
generally
simpering
in
their
expressions
with
idiotic
smiles
and
uttering
the
most
absurd
platitudes
at
intervals
however
they
would
appear
to
revive
suddenly
as
if
inspired
all
at
once
with
a
consciousness
of
their
condition
when
they
would
spring
upon
their
feet
in
a
momentary
flash
of
vigour
and
speak
for
a
short
period
of
their
prospects
in
a
manner
altogether
rational
although
full
of
the
most
intense
despair
it
is
possible
however
that
my
companions
may
have
entertained
the
same
opinion
of
their
own
condition
as
i
did
of
mine
and
that
i
may
have
unwittingly
been
guilty
of
the
same
extravagances
and
imbecilities
as
themselves--this
is
a
matter
which
cannot
be
determined
about
noon
parker
declared
that
he
saw
land
off
the
larboard
quarter
and
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
i
could
restrain
him
from
plunging
into
the
sea
with
the
view
of
swimming
toward
it
peters
and
augustus
took
little
notice
of
what
he
said
being
apparently
wrapped
up
in
moody
contemplation
upon
looking
in
the
direction
pointed
out
i
could
not
perceive
the
faintest
appearance
of
the
shore--indeed
i
was
too
well
aware
that
we
were
far
from
any
land
to
indulge
in
a
hope
of
that
nature
it
was
a
long
time
nevertheless
before
i
could
convince
parker
of
his
mistake
he
then
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
weeping
like
a
child
with
loud
cries
and
sobs
for
two
or
three
hours
when
becoming
exhausted
he
fell
asleep
peters
and
augustus
now
made
several
ineffectual
efforts
to
swallow
portions
of
the
leather
i
advised
them
to
chew
it
and
spit
it
out
but
they
were
too
excessively
debilitated
to
be
able
to
follow
my
advice
i
continued
to
chew
pieces
of
it
at
intervals
and
found
some
relief
from
so
doing
my
chief
distress
was
for
water
and
i
was
only
prevented
from
taking
a
draught
from
the
sea
by
remembering
the
horrible
consequences
which
thus
have
resulted
to
others
who
were
similarly
situated
with
ourselves
the
day
wore
on
in
this
manner
when
i
suddenly
discovered
a
sail
to
the
eastward
and
on
our
larboard
bow
she
appeared
to
be
a
large
ship
and
was
coming
nearly
athwart
us
being
probably
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
distant
none
of
my
companions
had
as
yet
discovered
her
and
i
forbore
to
tell
them
of
her
for
the
present
lest
we
might
again
be
disappointed
of
relief
at
length
upon
her
getting
nearer
i
saw
distinctly
that
she
was
heading
immediately
for
us
with
her
light
sails
filled
i
could
now
contain
myself
no
longer
and
pointed
her
out
to
my
fellow-sufferers
they
immediately
sprang
to
their
feet
again
indulging
in
the
most
extravagant
demonstrations
of
joy
weeping
laughing
in
an
idiotic
manner
jumping
stamping
upon
the
deck
tearing
their
hair
and
praying
and
cursing
by
turns
i
was
so
affected
by
their
conduct
as
well
as
by
what
i
considered
a
sure
prospect
of
deliverance
that
i
could
not
refrain
from
joining
in
with
their
madness
and
gave
way
to
the
impulses
of
my
gratitude
and
ecstasy
by
lying
and
rolling
on
the
deck
clapping
my
hands
shouting
and
other
similar
acts
until
i
was
suddenly
called
to
my
recollection
and
once
more
to
the
extreme
human
misery
and
despair
by
perceiving
the
ship
all
at
once
with
her
stern
fully
presented
toward
us
and
steering
in
a
direction
nearly
opposite
to
that
in
which
i
had
at
first
perceived
her
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
induce
my
poor
companions
to
believe
that
this
sad
reverse
in
our
prospects
had
actually
taken
place
they
replied
to
all
my
assertions
with
a
stare
and
a
gesture
implying
that
they
were
not
to
be
deceived
by
such
misrepresentations
the
conduct
of
augustus
most
sensibly
affected
me
in
spite
of
all
i
could
say
or
do
to
the
contrary
he
persisted
in
saying
that
the
ship
was
rapidly
nearing
us
and
in
making
preparations
to
go
on
board
of
her
some
seaweed
floating
by
the
brig
he
maintained
that
it
was
the
shipâ€™s
boat
and
endeavoured
to
throw
himself
upon
it
howling
and
shrieking
in
the
most
heartrending
manner
when
i
forcibly
restrained
him
from
thus
casting
himself
into
the
sea
having
become
in
some
degree
pacified
we
continued
to
watch
the
ship
until
we
finally
lost
sight
of
her
the
weather
becoming
hazy
with
a
light
breeze
springing
up
as
soon
as
she
was
entirely
gone
parker
turned
suddenly
toward
me
with
an
expression
of
countenance
which
made
me
shudder
there
was
about
him
an
air
of
self-possession
which
i
had
not
noticed
in
him
until
now
and
before
he
opened
his
lips
my
heart
told
me
what
he
would
say
he
proposed
in
a
few
words
that
one
of
us
should
die
to
preserve
the
existence
of
the
others
i
had
for
some
time
past
dwelt
upon
the
prospect
of
our
being
reduced
to
this
last
horrible
extremity
and
had
secretly
made
up
my
mind
to
suffer
death
in
any
shape
or
under
any
circumstances
rather
than
resort
to
such
a
course
nor
was
this
resolution
in
any
degree
weakened
by
the
present
intensity
of
hunger
under
which
i
laboured
the
proposition
had
not
been
heard
by
either
peters
or
augustus
i
therefore
took
parker
aside
and
mentally
praying
to
god
for
power
to
dissuade
him
from
the
horrible
purpose
he
entertained
i
expostulated
with
him
for
a
long
time
and
in
the
most
supplicating
manner
begging
him
in
the
name
of
every
thing
which
he
held
sacred
and
urging
him
by
every
species
of
argument
which
the
extremity
of
the
case
suggested
to
abandon
the
idea
and
not
to
mention
it
to
either
of
the
other
two
he
heard
all
i
said
without
attempting
to
controvert
any
of
my
arguments
and
i
had
begun
to
hope
that
he
would
be
prevailed
upon
to
do
as
i
desired
but
when
i
had
ceased
speaking
he
said
that
he
knew
very
well
all
i
had
said
was
true
and
that
to
resort
to
such
a
course
was
the
most
horrible
alternative
which
could
enter
into
the
mind
of
man
but
that
he
had
now
held
out
as
long
as
human
nature
could
be
sustained
that
it
was
unnecessary
for
all
to
perish
when
by
the
death
of
one
it
was
possible
and
even
probable
that
the
rest
might
be
finally
preserved
adding
that
i
might
save
myself
the
trouble
of
trying
to
turn
him
from
his
purpose
his
mind
having
been
thoroughly
made
up
on
the
subject
even
before
the
appearance
of
the
ship
and
that
only
her
heaving
in
sight
had
prevented
him
from
mentioning
his
intention
at
an
earlier
period
i
now
begged
him
if
he
would
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
abandon
his
design
at
least
to
defer
it
for
another
day
when
some
vessel
might
come
to
our
relief
again
reiterating
every
argument
i
could
devise
and
which
i
thought
likely
to
have
influence
with
one
of
his
rough
nature
he
said
in
reply
that
he
had
not
spoken
until
the
very
last
possible
moment
that
he
could
exist
no
longer
without
sustenance
of
some
kind
and
that
therefore
in
another
day
his
suggestion
would
be
too
late
as
regarded
himself
at
least
finding
that
he
was
not
to
be
moved
by
anything
i
could
say
in
a
mild
tone
i
now
assumed
a
different
demeanor
and
told
him
that
he
must
be
aware
i
had
suffered
less
than
any
of
us
from
our
calamities
that
my
health
and
strength
consequently
were
at
that
moment
far
better
than
his
own
or
than
that
either
of
peters
or
augustus
in
short
that
i
was
in
a
condition
to
have
my
own
way
by
force
if
i
found
it
necessary
and
that
if
he
attempted
in
any
manner
to
acquaint
the
others
with
his
bloody
and
cannibal
designs
i
would
not
hesitate
to
throw
him
into
the
sea
upon
this
he
immediately
seized
me
by
the
throat
and
drawing
a
knife
made
several
ineffectual
efforts
to
stab
me
in
the
stomach
an
atrocity
which
his
excessive
debility
alone
prevented
him
from
accomplishing
in
the
meantime
being
roused
to
a
high
pitch
of
anger
i
forced
him
to
the
vesselâ€™s
side
with
the
full
intention
of
throwing
him
overboard
he
was
saved
from
his
fate
however
by
the
interference
of
peters
who
now
approached
and
separated
us
asking
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
this
parker
told
before
i
could
find
means
in
any
manner
to
prevent
him
the
effect
of
his
words
was
even
more
terrible
than
what
i
had
anticipated
both
augustus
and
peters
who
it
seems
had
long
secretly
entertained
the
same
fearful
idea
which
parker
had
been
merely
the
first
to
broach
joined
with
him
in
his
design
and
insisted
upon
its
immediately
being
carried
into
effect
i
had
calculated
that
one
at
least
of
the
two
former
would
be
found
still
possessed
of
sufficient
strength
of
mind
to
side
with
myself
in
resisting
any
attempt
to
execute
so
dreadful
a
purpose
and
with
the
aid
of
either
one
of
them
i
had
no
fear
of
being
able
to
prevent
its
accomplishment
being
disappointed
in
this
expectation
it
became
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
attend
to
my
own
safety
as
a
further
resistance
on
my
part
might
possibly
be
considered
by
men
in
their
frightful
condition
a
sufficient
excuse
for
refusing
me
fair
play
in
the
tragedy
that
i
knew
would
speedily
be
enacted
i
now
told
them
i
was
willing
to
submit
to
the
proposal
merely
requesting
a
delay
of
about
one
hour
in
order
that
the
fog
which
had
gathered
around
us
might
have
an
opportunity
of
lifting
when
it
was
possible
that
the
ship
we
had
seen
might
be
again
in
sight
after
great
difficulty
i
obtained
from
them
a
promise
to
wait
thus
long
and
as
i
had
anticipated
a
breeze
rapidly
coming
in
the
fog
lifted
before
the
hour
had
expired
when
no
vessel
appearing
in
sight
we
prepared
to
draw
lots
it
is
with
extreme
reluctance
that
i
dwell
upon
the
appalling
scene
which
ensued
a
scene
which
with
its
minutest
details
no
after
events
have
been
able
to
efface
in
the
slightest
degree
from
my
memory
and
whose
stern
recollection
will
embitter
every
future
moment
of
my
existence
let
me
run
over
this
portion
of
my
narrative
with
as
much
haste
as
the
nature
of
the
events
to
be
spoken
of
will
permit
the
only
method
we
could
devise
for
the
terrific
lottery
in
which
we
were
to
take
each
a
chance
was
that
of
drawing
straws
small
splinters
of
wood
were
made
to
answer
our
purpose
and
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
be
the
holder
i
retired
to
one
end
of
the
hulk
while
my
poor
companions
silently
took
up
their
station
in
the
other
with
their
backs
turned
toward
me
the
bitterest
anxiety
which
i
endured
at
any
period
of
this
fearful
drama
was
while
i
occupied
myself
in
the
arrangement
of
the
lots
there
are
few
conditions
into
which
man
can
possibly
fall
where
he
will
not
feel
a
deep
interest
in
the
preservation
of
his
existence
an
interest
momentarily
increasing
with
the
frailness
of
the
tenure
by
which
that
existence
may
be
held
but
now
that
the
silent
definite
and
stern
nature
of
the
business
in
which
i
was
engaged
so
different
from
the
tumultuous
dangers
of
the
storm
or
the
gradually
approaching
horrors
of
famine
allowed
me
to
reflect
on
the
few
chances
i
had
of
escaping
the
most
appalling
of
deaths--a
death
for
the
most
appalling
of
purposes--every
particle
of
that
energy
which
had
so
long
buoyed
me
up
departed
like
feathers
before
the
wind
leaving
me
a
helpless
prey
to
the
most
abject
and
pitiable
terror
i
could
not
at
first
even
summon
up
sufficient
strength
to
tear
and
fit
together
the
small
splinters
of
wood
my
fingers
absolutely
refusing
their
office
and
my
knees
knocking
violently
against
each
other
my
mind
ran
over
rapidly
a
thousand
absurd
projects
by
which
to
avoid
becoming
a
partner
in
the
awful
speculation
i
thought
of
falling
on
my
knees
to
my
companions
and
entreating
them
to
let
me
escape
this
necessity
of
suddenly
rushing
upon
them
and
by
putting
one
of
them
to
death
of
rendering
the
decision
by
lot
useless--in
short
of
every
thing
but
of
going
through
with
the
matter
i
had
in
hand
at
last
after
wasting
a
long
time
in
this
imbecile
conduct
i
was
recalled
to
my
senses
by
the
voice
of
parker
who
urged
me
to
relieve
them
at
once
from
the
terrible
anxiety
they
were
enduring
even
then
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
arrange
the
splinters
upon
the
spot
but
thought
over
every
species
of
finesse
by
which
i
could
trick
some
one
of
my
fellow-sufferers
to
draw
the
short
straw
as
it
had
been
agreed
that
whoever
drew
the
shortest
of
four
splinters
from
my
hand
was
to
die
for
the
preservation
of
the
rest
before
any
one
condemn
me
for
this
apparent
heartlessness
let
him
be
placed
in
a
situation
precisely
similar
to
my
own
at
length
delay
was
no
longer
possible
and
with
a
heart
almost
bursting
from
my
bosom
i
advanced
to
the
region
of
the
forecastle
where
my
companions
were
awaiting
me
i
held
out
my
hand
with
the
splinters
and
peters
immediately
drew
he
was
free--his
at
least
was
not
the
shortest
and
there
was
now
another
chance
against
my
escape
i
summoned
up
all
my
strength
and
passed
the
lots
to
augustus
he
also
drew
immediately
and
he
also
was
free
and
now
whether
i
should
live
or
die
the
chances
were
no
more
than
precisely
even
at
this
moment
all
the
fierceness
of
the
tiger
possessed
my
bosom
and
i
felt
toward
my
poor
fellow-creature
parker
the
most
intense
the
most
diabolical
hatred
but
the
feeling
did
not
last
and
at
length
with
a
convulsive
shudder
and
closed
eyes
i
held
out
the
two
remaining
splinters
toward
him
it
was
fully
five
minutes
before
he
could
summon
resolution
to
draw
during
which
period
of
heartrending
suspense
i
never
once
opened
my
eyes
presently
one
of
the
two
lots
was
quickly
drawn
from
my
hand
the
decision
was
then
over
yet
i
knew
not
whether
it
was
for
me
or
against
me
no
one
spoke
and
still
i
dared
not
satisfy
myself
by
looking
at
the
splinter
i
held
peters
at
length
took
me
by
the
hand
and
i
forced
myself
to
look
up
when
i
immediately
saw
by
the
countenance
of
parker
that
i
was
safe
and
that
he
it
was
who
had
been
doomed
to
suffer
gasping
for
breath
i
fell
senseless
to
the
deck
i
recovered
from
my
swoon
in
time
to
behold
the
consummation
of
the
tragedy
in
the
death
of
him
who
had
been
chiefly
instrumental
in
bringing
it
about
he
made
no
resistance
whatever
and
was
stabbed
in
the
back
by
peters
when
he
fell
instantly
dead
i
must
not
dwell
upon
the
fearful
repast
which
immediately
ensued
such
things
may
be
imagined
but
words
have
no
power
to
impress
the
mind
with
the
exquisite
horror
of
their
reality
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
having
in
some
measure
appeased
the
raging
thirst
which
consumed
us
by
the
blood
of
the
victim
and
having
by
common
consent
taken
off
the
hands
feet
and
head
throwing
them
together
with
the
entrails
into
the
sea
we
devoured
the
rest
of
the
body
piecemeal
during
the
four
ever
memorable
days
of
the
seventeenth
eighteenth
nineteenth
and
twentieth
of
the
month
on
the
nineteenth
there
coming
on
a
smart
shower
which
lasted
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
we
contrived
to
catch
some
water
by
means
of
a
sheet
which
had
been
fished
up
from
the
cabin
by
our
drag
just
after
the
gale
the
quantity
we
took
in
all
did
not
amount
to
more
than
half
a
gallon
but
even
this
scanty
allowance
supplied
us
with
comparative
strength
and
hope
on
the
twenty-first
we
were
again
reduced
to
the
last
necessity
the
weather
still
remained
warm
and
pleasant
with
occasional
fogs
and
light
breezes
most
usually
from
n
to
w
on
the
twenty-second
as
we
were
sitting
close
huddled
together
gloomily
revolving
over
our
lamentable
condition
there
flashed
through
my
mind
all
at
once
an
idea
which
inspired
me
with
a
bright
gleam
of
hope
i
remembered
that
when
the
foremast
had
been
cut
away
peters
being
in
the
windward
chains
passed
one
of
the
axes
into
my
hand
requesting
me
to
put
it
if
possible
in
a
place
of
security
and
that
a
few
minutes
before
the
last
heavy
sea
struck
the
brig
and
filled
her
i
had
taken
this
axe
into
the
forecastle
and
laid
it
in
one
of
the
larboard
berths
i
now
thought
it
possible
that
by
getting
at
this
axe
we
might
cut
through
the
deck
over
the
storeroom
and
thus
readily
supply
ourselves
with
provisions
when
i
communicated
this
object
to
my
companions
they
uttered
a
feeble
shout
of
joy
and
we
all
proceeded
forthwith
to
the
forecastle
the
difficulty
of
descending
here
was
greater
than
that
of
going
down
in
the
cabin
the
opening
being
much
smaller
for
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
whole
framework
about
the
cabin
companion-hatch
had
been
carried
away
whereas
the
forecastle-way
being
a
simple
hatch
of
only
about
three
feet
square
had
remained
uninjured
i
did
not
hesitate
however
to
attempt
the
descent
and
a
rope
being
fastened
round
my
body
as
before
i
plunged
boldly
in
feet
foremost
made
my
way
quickly
to
the
berth
and
at
the
first
attempt
brought
up
the
axe
it
was
hailed
with
the
most
ecstatic
joy
and
triumph
and
the
ease
with
which
it
had
been
obtained
was
regarded
as
an
omen
of
our
ultimate
preservation
we
now
commenced
cutting
at
the
deck
with
all
the
energy
of
rekindled
hope
peters
and
myself
taking
the
axe
by
turns
augustusâ€™s
wounded
arm
not
permitting
him
to
aid
us
in
any
degree
as
we
were
still
so
feeble
as
to
be
scarcely
able
to
stand
unsupported
and
could
consequently
work
but
a
minute
or
two
without
resting
it
soon
became
evident
that
many
long
hours
would
be
necessary
to
accomplish
our
task--that
is
to
cut
an
opening
sufficiently
large
to
admit
of
a
free
access
to
the
storeroom
this
consideration
however
did
not
discourage
us
and
working
all
night
by
the
light
of
the
moon
we
succeeded
in
effecting
our
purpose
by
daybreak
on
the
morning
of
the
twenty-third
peters
now
volunteered
to
go
down
and
having
made
all
arrangements
as
before
he
descended
and
soon
returned
bringing
up
with
him
a
small
jar
which
to
our
great
joy
proved
to
be
full
of
olives
having
shared
these
among
us
and
devoured
them
with
the
greatest
avidity
we
proceeded
to
let
him
down
again
this
time
he
succeeded
beyond
our
utmost
expectations
returning
instantly
with
a
large
ham
and
a
bottle
of
madeira
wine
of
the
latter
we
each
took
a
moderate
sup
having
learned
by
experience
the
pernicious
consequences
of
indulging
too
freely
the
ham
except
about
two
pounds
near
the
bone
was
not
in
a
condition
to
be
eaten
having
been
entirely
spoiled
by
the
salt
water
the
sound
part
was
divided
among
us
peters
and
augustus
not
being
able
to
restrain
their
appetite
swallowed
theirs
upon
the
instant
but
i
was
more
cautious
and
ate
but
a
small
portion
of
mine
dreading
the
thirst
which
i
knew
would
ensue
we
now
rested
a
while
from
our
labors
which
had
been
intolerably
severe
by
noon
feeling
somewhat
strengthened
and
refreshed
we
again
renewed
our
attempt
at
getting
up
provisions
peters
and
myself
going
down
alternately
and
always
with
more
or
less
success
until
sundown
during
this
interval
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
bring
up
altogether
four
more
small
jars
of
olives
another
ham
a
carboy
containing
nearly
three
gallons
of
excellent
cape
madeira
wine
and
what
gave
us
still
more
delight
a
small
tortoise
of
the
gallipago
breed
several
of
which
had
been
taken
on
board
by
captain
barnard
as
the
grampus
was
leaving
port
from
the
schooner
mary
pitts
just
returned
from
a
sealing
voyage
in
the
pacific
in
a
subsequent
portion
of
this
narrative
i
shall
have
frequent
occasion
to
mention
this
species
of
tortoise
it
is
found
principally
as
most
of
my
readers
may
know
in
the
group
of
islands
called
the
gallipagos
which
indeed
derive
their
name
from
the
animal--the
spanish
word
gallipago
meaning
a
fresh-water
terrapin
from
the
peculiarity
of
their
shape
and
action
they
have
been
sometimes
called
the
elephant
tortoise
they
are
frequently
found
of
an
enormous
size
i
have
myself
seen
several
which
would
weigh
from
twelve
to
fifteen
hundred
pounds
although
i
do
not
remember
that
any
navigator
speaks
of
having
seen
them
weighing
more
than
eight
hundred
their
appearance
is
singular
and
even
disgusting
their
steps
are
very
slow
measured
and
heavy
their
bodies
being
carried
about
a
foot
from
the
ground
their
neck
is
long
and
exceedingly
slender
from
eighteen
inches
to
two
feet
is
a
very
common
length
and
i
killed
one
where
the
distance
from
the
shoulder
to
the
extremity
of
the
head
was
no
less
than
three
feet
ten
inches
the
head
has
a
striking
resemblance
to
that
of
a
serpent
they
can
exist
without
food
for
an
almost
incredible
length
of
time
instances
having
been
known
where
they
have
been
thrown
into
the
hold
of
a
vessel
and
lain
two
years
without
nourishment
of
any
kind--being
as
fat
and
in
every
respect
in
as
good
order
at
the
expiration
of
the
time
as
when
they
were
first
put
in
in
one
particular
these
extraordinary
animals
bear
a
resemblance
to
the
dromedary
or
camel
of
the
desert
in
a
bag
at
the
root
of
the
neck
they
carry
with
them
a
constant
supply
of
water
in
some
instances
upon
killing
them
after
a
full
yearâ€™s
deprivation
of
all
nourishment
as
much
as
three
gallons
of
perfectly
sweet
and
fresh
water
have
been
found
in
their
bags
their
food
is
chiefly
wild
parsley
and
celery
with
purslain
sea-kelp
and
prickly
pears
upon
which
latter
vegetable
they
thrive
wonderfully
a
great
quantity
of
it
being
usually
found
on
the
hillsides
near
the
shore
wherever
the
animal
itself
is
discovered
they
are
excellent
and
highly
nutritious
food
and
have
no
doubt
been
the
means
of
preserving
the
lives
of
thousands
of
seamen
employed
in
the
whale-fishery
and
other
pursuits
in
the
pacific
the
one
which
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
bring
up
from
the
storeroom
was
not
of
a
large
size
weighing
probably
sixty-five
or
seventy
pounds
it
was
a
female
and
in
excellent
condition
being
exceedingly
fat
and
having
more
than
a
quart
of
limpid
and
sweet
water
in
its
bag
this
was
indeed
a
treasure
and
falling
on
our
knees
with
one
accord
we
returned
fervent
thanks
to
god
for
so
seasonable
a
relief
we
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
the
animal
up
through
the
opening
as
its
struggles
were
fierce
and
its
strength
prodigious
it
was
upon
the
point
of
making
its
escape
from
peterâ€™s
grasp
and
slipping
back
into
the
water
when
augustus
throwing
a
rope
with
a
slipknot
around
its
throat
held
it
up
in
this
manner
until
i
jumped
into
the
hole
by
the
side
of
peters
and
assisted
him
in
lifting
it
out
the
water
we
drew
carefully
from
the
bag
into
the
jug
which
it
will
be
remembered
had
been
brought
up
before
from
the
cabin
having
done
this
we
broke
off
the
neck
of
a
bottle
so
as
to
form
with
the
cork
a
kind
of
glass
holding
not
quite
half
a
gill
we
then
each
drank
one
of
these
measures
full
and
resolved
to
limit
ourselves
to
this
quantity
per
day
as
long
as
it
should
hold
out
during
the
last
two
or
three
days
the
weather
having
been
dry
and
pleasant
the
bedding
we
had
obtained
from
the
cabin
as
well
as
our
clothing
had
become
thoroughly
dry
so
that
we
passed
this
night
that
of
the
twenty-third
in
comparative
comfort
enjoying
a
tranquil
repose
after
having
supped
plentifully
on
olives
and
ham
with
a
small
allowance
of
the
wine
being
afraid
of
losing
some
of
our
stores
overboard
during
the
night
in
the
event
of
a
breeze
springing
up
we
secured
them
as
well
as
possible
with
cordage
to
the
fragments
of
the
windlass
our
tortoise
which
we
were
anxious
to
preserve
alive
as
long
as
we
could
we
threw
on
its
back
and
otherwise
carefully
fastened
july
24
this
morning
saw
us
wonderfully
recruited
in
spirits
and
strength
notwithstanding
the
perilous
situation
in
which
we
were
still
placed
ignorant
of
our
position
although
certainly
at
a
great
distance
from
land
without
more
food
than
would
last
us
for
a
fortnight
even
with
great
care
almost
entirely
without
water
and
floating
about
at
the
mercy
of
every
wind
and
wave
on
the
merest
wreck
in
the
world
still
the
infinitely
more
terrible
distresses
and
dangers
from
which
we
had
so
lately
and
so
providentially
been
delivered
caused
us
to
regard
what
we
now
endured
as
but
little
more
than
an
ordinary
evil--so
strictly
comparative
is
either
good
or
ill
at
sunrise
we
were
preparing
to
renew
our
attempts
at
getting
up
something
from
the
storeroom
when
a
smart
shower
coming
on
with
some
lightning
we
turn
our
attention
to
the
catching
of
water
by
means
of
the
sheet
we
had
used
before
for
this
purpose
we
had
no
other
means
of
collecting
the
rain
than
by
holding
the
sheet
spread
out
with
one
of
the
forechain-plates
in
the
middle
of
it
the
water
thus
conducted
to
the
centre
was
drained
through
into
our
jug
we
had
nearly
filled
it
in
this
manner
when
a
heavy
squall
coming
on
from
the
northward
obliged
us
to
desist
as
the
hulk
began
once
more
to
roll
so
violently
that
we
could
no
longer
keep
our
feet
we
now
went
forward
and
lashing
ourselves
securely
to
the
remnant
of
the
windlass
as
before
awaited
the
event
with
far
more
calmness
than
could
have
been
anticipated
or
would
have
been
imagined
possible
under
the
circumstances
at
noon
the
wind
had
freshened
into
a
two-reef
breeze
and
by
night
into
a
stiff
gale
accompanied
with
a
tremendously
heavy
swell
experience
having
taught
us
however
the
best
method
of
arranging
our
lashings
we
weathered
this
dreary
night
in
tolerable
security
although
thoroughly
drenched
at
almost
every
instant
by
the
sea
and
in
momentary
dread
of
being
washed
off
fortunately
the
weather
was
so
warm
as
to
render
the
water
rather
grateful
than
otherwise
july
25
this
morning
the
gale
had
diminished
to
a
mere
ten-knot
breeze
and
the
sea
had
gone
down
with
it
so
considerably
that
we
were
able
to
keep
ourselves
dry
upon
the
deck
to
our
great
grief
however
we
found
that
two
jars
of
our
olives
as
well
as
the
whole
of
our
ham
had
been
washed
overboard
in
spite
of
the
careful
manner
in
which
they
had
been
fastened
we
determined
not
to
kill
the
tortoise
as
yet
and
contented
ourselves
for
the
present
with
a
breakfast
on
a
few
of
the
olives
and
a
measure
of
water
each
which
latter
we
mixed
half
and
half
with
wine
finding
great
relief
and
strength
from
the
mixture
without
the
distressing
intoxication
which
had
ensued
upon
drinking
the
port
the
sea
was
still
far
too
rough
for
the
renewal
of
our
efforts
at
getting
up
provision
from
the
storeroom
several
articles
of
no
importance
to
us
in
our
present
situation
floated
up
through
the
opening
during
the
day
and
were
immediately
washed
overboard
we
also
now
observed
that
the
hulk
lay
more
along
than
ever
so
that
we
could
not
stand
an
instant
without
lashing
ourselves
on
this
account
we
passed
a
gloomy
and
uncomfortable
day
at
noon
the
sun
appeared
to
be
nearly
vertical
and
we
had
no
doubt
that
we
had
been
driven
down
by
the
long
succession
of
northward
and
northwesterly
winds
into
the
near
vicinity
of
the
equator
toward
evening
we
saw
several
sharks
and
were
somewhat
alarmed
by
the
audacious
manner
in
which
an
enormously
large
one
approached
us
at
one
time
a
lurch
throwing
the
deck
very
far
beneath
the
water
the
monster
actually
swam
in
upon
us
floundering
for
some
moments
just
over
the
companion-hatch
and
striking
peters
violently
with
his
tail
a
heavy
sea
at
length
hurled
him
overboard
much
to
our
relief
in
moderate
weather
we
might
have
easily
captured
him
july
26
this
morning
the
wind
having
greatly
abated
and
the
sea
not
being
very
rough
we
determined
to
renew
our
exertions
in
the
storeroom
after
a
great
deal
of
hard
labor
during
the
whole
day
we
found
that
nothing
further
was
to
be
expected
from
this
quarter
the
partitions
of
the
room
having
been
stove
during
the
night
and
its
contents
swept
into
the
hold
this
discovery
as
may
be
supposed
filled
us
with
despair
july
27
the
sea
nearly
smooth
with
a
light
wind
and
still
from
the
northward
and
westward
the
sun
coming
out
hotly
in
the
afternoon
we
occupied
ourselves
in
drying
our
clothes
found
great
relief
from
thirst
and
much
comfort
otherwise
by
bathing
in
the
sea
in
this
however
we
were
forced
to
use
great
caution
being
afraid
of
sharks
several
of
which
were
seen
swimming
around
the
brig
during
the
day
july
28
good
weather
still
the
brig
now
began
to
lie
along
so
alarmingly
that
we
feared
she
would
eventually
roll
bottom
up
prepared
ourselves
as
well
as
we
could
for
this
emergency
lashing
our
tortoise
waterjug
and
two
remaining
jars
of
olives
as
far
as
possible
over
to
the
windward
placing
them
outside
the
hull
below
the
main-chains
the
sea
very
smooth
all
day
with
little
or
no
wind
july
29
a
continuance
of
the
same
weather
augustusâ€™s
wounded
arm
began
to
evince
symptoms
of
mortification
he
complained
of
drowsiness
and
excessive
thirst
but
no
acute
pain
nothing
could
be
done
for
his
relief
beyond
rubbing
his
wounds
with
a
little
of
the
vinegar
from
the
olives
and
from
this
no
benefit
seemed
to
be
experienced
we
did
every
thing
in
our
power
for
his
comfort
and
trebled
his
allowance
of
water
july
30
an
excessively
hot
day
with
no
wind
an
enormous
shark
kept
close
by
the
hulk
during
the
whole
of
the
forenoon
we
made
several
unsuccessful
attempts
to
capture
him
by
means
of
a
noose
augustus
much
worse
and
evidently
sinking
as
much
from
want
of
proper
nourishment
as
from
the
effect
of
his
wounds
he
constantly
prayed
to
be
relieved
from
his
sufferings
wishing
for
nothing
but
death
this
evening
we
ate
the
last
of
our
olives
and
found
the
water
in
our
jug
so
putrid
that
we
could
not
swallow
it
at
all
without
the
addition
of
wine
determined
to
kill
our
tortoise
in
the
morning
july
31
after
a
night
of
excessive
anxiety
and
fatigue
owing
to
the
position
of
the
hulk
we
set
about
killing
and
cutting
up
our
tortoise
he
proved
to
be
much
smaller
than
we
had
supposed
although
in
good
condition--the
whole
meat
about
him
not
amounting
to
more
than
ten
pounds
with
a
view
of
preserving
a
portion
of
this
as
long
as
possible
we
cut
it
into
fine
pieces
and
filled
with
them
our
three
remaining
olive
jars
and
the
wine-bottle
all
of
which
had
been
kept
pouring
in
afterward
the
vinegar
from
the
olives
in
this
manner
we
put
away
about
three
pounds
of
the
tortoise
intending
not
to
touch
it
until
we
had
consumed
the
rest
we
concluded
to
restrict
ourselves
to
about
four
ounces
of
the
meat
per
day
the
whole
would
thus
last
us
thirteen
days
a
brisk
shower
with
severe
thunder
and
lightning
came
on
about
dusk
but
lasted
so
short
a
time
that
we
only
succeeded
in
catching
about
half
a
pint
of
water
the
whole
of
this
by
common
consent
was
given
to
augustus
who
now
appeared
to
be
in
the
last
extremity
he
drank
the
water
from
the
sheet
as
we
caught
it
we
holding
it
above
him
as
he
lay
so
as
to
let
it
run
into
his
mouth
for
we
had
now
nothing
left
capable
of
holding
water
unless
we
had
chosen
to
empty
out
our
wine
from
the
carboy
or
the
stale
water
from
the
jug
either
of
these
expedients
would
have
been
resorted
to
had
the
shower
lasted
the
sufferer
seemed
to
derive
but
little
benefit
from
the
draught
his
arm
was
completely
black
from
the
wrist
to
the
shoulder
and
his
feet
were
like
ice
we
expected
every
moment
to
see
him
breathe
his
last
he
was
frightfully
emaciated
so
much
so
that
although
he
weighed
a
hundred
and
twenty-seven
pounds
upon
his
leaving
nantucket
he
now
did
not
weigh
more
than
forty
or
fifty
at
the
farthest
his
eyes
were
sunk
far
in
his
head
being
scarcely
perceptible
and
the
skin
of
his
cheeks
hung
so
loosely
as
to
prevent
his
masticating
any
food
or
even
swallowing
any
liquid
without
great
difficulty
august
1
a
continuance
of
the
same
calm
weather
with
an
oppressively
hot
sun
suffered
exceedingly
from
thirst
the
water
in
the
jug
being
absolutely
putrid
and
swarming
with
vermin
we
contrived
nevertheless
to
swallow
a
portion
of
it
by
mixing
it
with
wine
our
thirst
however
was
but
little
abated
we
found
more
relief
by
bathing
in
the
sea
but
could
not
avail
ourselves
of
this
expedient
except
at
long
intervals
on
account
of
the
continual
presence
of
sharks
we
now
saw
clearly
that
augustus
could
not
be
saved
that
he
was
evidently
dying
we
could
do
nothing
to
relieve
his
sufferings
which
appeared
to
be
great
about
twelve
oâ€™clock
he
expired
in
strong
convulsions
and
without
having
spoken
for
several
hours
his
death
filled
us
with
the
most
gloomy
forebodings
and
had
so
great
an
effect
upon
our
spirits
that
we
sat
motionless
by
the
corpse
during
the
whole
day
and
never
addressed
each
other
except
in
a
whisper
it
was
not
until
some
time
after
dark
that
we
took
courage
to
get
up
and
throw
the
body
overboard
it
was
then
loathsome
beyond
expression
and
so
far
decayed
that
as
peters
attempted
to
lift
it
an
entire
leg
came
off
in
his
grasp
as
the
mass
of
putrefaction
slipped
over
the
vesselâ€™s
side
into
the
water
the
glare
of
phosphoric
light
with
which
it
was
surrounded
plainly
discovered
to
us
seven
or
eight
large
sharks
the
clashing
of
whose
horrible
teeth
as
their
prey
was
torn
to
pieces
among
them
might
have
been
heard
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
we
shrunk
within
ourselves
in
the
extremity
of
horror
at
the
sound
august
2
the
same
fearfully
calm
and
hot
weather
the
dawn
found
us
in
a
state
of
pitiable
dejection
as
well
as
bodily
exhaustion
the
water
in
the
jug
was
now
absolutely
useless
being
a
thick
gelatinous
mass
nothing
but
frightful-looking
worms
mingled
with
slime
we
threw
it
out
and
washed
the
jug
well
in
the
sea
afterward
pouring
a
little
vinegar
in
it
from
our
bottles
of
pickled
tortoise
our
thirst
could
now
scarcely
be
endured
and
we
tried
in
vain
to
relieve
it
by
wine
which
seemed
only
to
add
fuel
to
the
flame
and
excited
us
to
a
high
degree
of
intoxication
we
afterward
endeavoured
to
relieve
our
sufferings
by
mixing
the
wine
with
seawater
but
this
instantly
brought
about
the
most
violent
retchings
so
that
we
never
again
attempted
it
during
the
whole
day
we
anxiously
sought
an
opportunity
of
bathing
but
to
no
purpose
for
the
hulk
was
now
entirely
besieged
on
all
sides
with
sharks--no
doubt
the
identical
monsters
who
had
devoured
our
poor
companion
on
the
evening
before
and
who
were
in
momentary
expectation
of
another
similar
feast
this
circumstance
occasioned
us
the
most
bitter
regret
and
filled
us
with
the
most
depressing
and
melancholy
forebodings
we
had
experienced
indescribable
relief
in
bathing
and
to
have
this
resource
cut
off
in
so
frightful
a
manner
was
more
than
we
could
bear
nor
indeed
were
we
altogether
free
from
the
apprehension
of
immediate
danger
for
the
least
slip
or
false
movement
would
have
thrown
us
at
once
within
reach
of
those
voracious
fish
who
frequently
thrust
themselves
directly
upon
us
swimming
up
to
leeward
no
shouts
or
exertions
on
our
part
seemed
to
alarm
them
even
when
one
of
the
largest
was
struck
with
an
axe
by
peters
and
much
wounded
he
persisted
in
his
attempts
to
push
in
where
we
were
a
cloud
came
up
at
dusk
but
to
our
extreme
anguish
passed
over
without
discharging
itself
it
is
quite
impossible
to
conceive
our
sufferings
from
thirst
at
this
period
we
passed
a
sleepless
night
both
on
this
account
and
through
dread
of
the
sharks
august
3
no
prospect
of
relief
and
the
brig
lying
still
more
and
more
along
so
that
now
we
could
not
maintain
a
footing
upon
deck
at
all
busied
ourselves
in
securing
our
wine
and
tortoise-meat
so
that
we
might
not
lose
them
in
the
event
of
our
rolling
over
got
out
two
stout
spikes
from
the
forechains
and
by
means
of
the
axe
drove
them
into
the
hull
to
windward
within
a
couple
of
feet
of
the
water
this
not
being
very
far
from
the
keel
as
we
were
nearly
upon
our
beam-ends
to
these
spikes
we
now
lashed
our
provisions
as
being
more
secure
than
their
former
position
beneath
the
chains
suffered
great
agony
from
thirst
during
the
whole
day--no
chance
of
bathing
on
account
of
the
sharks
which
never
left
us
for
a
moment
found
it
impossible
to
sleep
august
4
a
little
before
daybreak
we
perceived
that
the
hulk
was
heeling
over
and
aroused
ourselves
to
prevent
being
thrown
off
by
the
movement
at
first
the
roll
was
slow
and
gradual
and
we
contrived
to
clamber
over
to
windward
very
well
having
taken
the
precaution
to
leave
ropes
hanging
from
the
spikes
we
had
driven
in
for
the
provision
but
we
had
not
calculated
sufficiently
upon
the
acceleration
of
the
impetus
for
presently
the
heel
became
too
violent
to
allow
of
our
keeping
pace
with
it
and
before
either
of
us
knew
what
was
to
happen
we
found
ourselves
hurled
furiously
into
the
sea
and
struggling
several
fathoms
beneath
the
surface
with
the
huge
hull
immediately
above
us
in
going
under
the
water
i
had
been
obliged
to
let
go
my
hold
upon
the
rope
and
finding
that
i
was
completely
beneath
the
vessel
and
my
strength
nearly
exhausted
i
scarcely
made
a
struggle
for
life
and
resigned
myself
in
a
few
seconds
to
die
but
here
again
i
was
deceived
not
having
taken
into
consideration
the
natural
rebound
of
the
hull
to
windward
the
whirl
of
the
water
upward
which
the
vessel
occasioned
in
rolling
partially
back
brought
me
to
the
surface
still
more
violently
than
i
had
been
plunged
beneath
upon
coming
up
i
found
myself
about
twenty
yards
from
the
hulk
as
near
as
i
could
judge
she
was
lying
keel
up
rocking
furiously
from
side
to
side
and
the
sea
in
all
directions
around
was
much
agitated
and
full
of
strong
whirlpools
i
could
see
nothing
of
peters
an
oil-cask
was
floating
within
a
few
feet
of
me
and
various
other
articles
from
the
brig
were
scattered
about
my
principal
terror
was
now
on
account
of
the
sharks
which
i
knew
to
be
in
my
vicinity
in
order
to
deter
these
if
possible
from
approaching
me
i
splashed
the
water
vigorously
with
both
hands
and
feet
as
i
swam
towards
the
hulk
creating
a
body
of
foam
i
have
no
doubt
that
to
this
expedient
simple
as
it
was
i
was
indebted
for
my
preservation
for
the
sea
all
round
the
brig
just
before
her
rolling
over
was
so
crowded
with
these
monsters
that
i
must
have
been
and
really
was
in
actual
contact
with
some
of
them
during
my
progress
by
great
good
fortune
however
i
reached
the
side
of
the
vessel
in
safety
although
so
utterly
weakened
by
the
violent
exertion
i
had
used
that
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
get
upon
it
but
for
the
timely
assistance
of
peters
who
now
to
my
great
joy
made
his
appearance
having
scrambled
up
to
the
keel
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
hull
and
threw
me
the
end
of
a
rope--one
of
those
which
had
been
attached
to
the
spikes
having
barely
escaped
this
danger
our
attention
was
now
directed
to
the
dreadful
imminency
of
another--that
of
absolute
starvation
our
whole
stock
of
provision
had
been
swept
overboard
in
spite
of
all
our
care
in
securing
it
and
seeing
no
longer
the
remotest
possibility
of
obtaining
more
we
gave
way
both
of
us
to
despair
weeping
aloud
like
children
and
neither
of
us
attempting
to
offer
consolation
to
the
other
such
weakness
can
scarcely
be
conceived
and
to
those
who
have
never
been
similarly
situated
will
no
doubt
appear
unnatural
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
our
intellects
were
so
entirely
disordered
by
the
long
course
of
privation
and
terror
to
which
we
had
been
subjected
that
we
could
not
justly
be
considered
at
that
period
in
the
light
of
rational
beings
in
subsequent
perils
nearly
as
great
if
not
greater
i
bore
up
with
fortitude
against
all
the
evils
of
my
situation
and
peters
it
will
be
seen
evinced
a
stoical
philosophy
nearly
as
incredible
as
his
present
childlike
supineness
and
imbecility--the
mental
condition
made
the
difference
the
overturning
of
the
brig
even
with
the
consequent
loss
of
the
wine
and
turtle
would
not
in
fact
have
rendered
our
situation
more
deplorable
than
before
except
for
the
disappearance
of
the
bedclothes
by
which
we
had
been
hitherto
enabled
to
catch
rainwater
and
of
the
jug
in
which
we
had
kept
it
when
caught
for
we
found
the
whole
bottom
from
within
two
or
three
feet
of
the
bends
as
far
as
the
keel
together
with
the
keel
itself
thickly
covered
with
large
barnacles
which
proved
to
be
excellent
and
highly
nutritious
food
thus
in
two
important
respects
the
accident
we
had
so
greatly
dreaded
proved
to
be
a
benefit
rather
than
an
injury
it
had
opened
to
us
a
supply
of
provisions
which
we
could
not
have
exhausted
using
it
moderately
in
a
month
and
it
had
greatly
contributed
to
our
comfort
as
regards
position
we
being
much
more
at
ease
and
in
infinitely
less
danger
than
before
the
difficulty
however
of
now
obtaining
water
blinded
us
to
all
the
benefits
of
the
change
in
our
condition
that
we
might
be
ready
to
avail
ourselves
as
far
as
possible
of
any
shower
which
might
fall
we
took
off
our
shirts
to
make
use
of
them
as
we
had
of
the
sheets--not
hoping
of
course
to
get
more
in
this
way
even
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
than
half
a
gill
at
a
time
no
signs
of
a
cloud
appeared
during
the
day
and
the
agonies
of
our
thirst
were
nearly
intolerable
at
night
peters
obtained
about
an
hourâ€™s
disturbed
sleep
but
my
intense
sufferings
would
not
permit
me
to
close
my
eyes
for
a
single
moment
august
5
to-day
a
gentle
breeze
springing
up
carried
us
through
a
vast
quantity
of
seaweed
among
which
we
were
so
fortunate
as
to
find
eleven
small
crabs
which
afforded
us
several
delicious
meals
their
shells
being
quite
soft
we
ate
them
entire
and
found
that
they
irritated
our
thirst
far
less
than
the
barnacles
seeing
no
trace
of
sharks
among
the
seaweed
we
also
ventured
to
bathe
and
remained
in
the
water
for
four
or
five
hours
during
which
we
experienced
a
very
sensible
diminution
of
our
thirst
were
greatly
refreshed
and
spent
the
night
somewhat
more
comfortably
than
before
both
of
us
snatching
a
little
sleep
august
6
this
day
we
were
blessed
by
a
brisk
and
continual
rain
lasting
from
about
noon
until
after
dark
bitterly
did
we
now
regret
the
loss
of
our
jug
and
carboy
for
in
spite
of
the
little
means
we
had
of
catching
the
water
we
might
have
filled
one
if
not
both
of
them
as
it
was
we
contrived
to
satisfy
the
cravings
of
thirst
by
suffering
the
shirts
to
become
saturated
and
then
wringing
them
so
as
to
let
the
grateful
fluid
trickle
into
our
mouths
in
this
occupation
we
passed
the
entire
day
august
7
just
at
daybreak
we
both
at
the
same
instant
descried
a
sail
to
the
eastward
and
evidently
coming
towards
us
we
hailed
the
glorious
sight
with
a
long
although
feeble
shout
of
rapture
and
began
instantly
to
make
every
signal
in
our
power
by
flaring
the
shirts
in
the
air
leaping
as
high
as
our
weak
condition
would
permit
and
even
by
hallooing
with
all
the
strength
of
our
lungs
although
the
vessel
could
not
have
been
less
than
fifteen
miles
distant
however
she
still
continued
to
near
our
hulk
and
we
felt
that
if
she
but
held
her
present
course
she
must
eventually
come
so
close
as
to
perceive
us
in
about
an
hour
after
we
first
discovered
her
we
could
clearly
see
the
people
on
her
decks
she
was
a
long
low
and
rakish-looking
topsail
schooner
with
a
black
ball
in
her
foretopsail
and
had
apparently
a
full
crew
we
now
became
alarmed
for
we
could
hardly
imagine
it
possible
that
she
did
not
observe
us
and
were
apprehensive
that
she
meant
to
leave
us
to
perish
as
we
were--an
act
of
fiendish
barbarity
which
however
incredible
it
may
appear
has
been
repeatedly
perpetuated
at
sea
under
circumstances
very
nearly
similar
and
by
beings
who
were
regarded
as
belonging
to
the
human
species
2
in
this
instance
however
by
the
mercy
of
god
we
were
destined
to
be
most
happily
deceived
for
presently
we
were
aware
of
a
sudden
commotion
on
the
deck
of
the
stranger
who
immediately
afterward
ran
up
a
british
flag
and
hauling
her
wind
bore
up
directly
upon
us
in
half
an
hour
more
we
found
ourselves
in
her
cabin
she
proved
to
be
the
jane
guy
of
liverpool
captain
guy
bound
on
a
sealing
and
trading
voyage
to
the
south
seas
and
pacific
the
jane
guy
was
a
fine-looking
topsail
schooner
of
a
hundred
and
eighty
tons
burden
she
was
unusually
sharp
in
the
bows
and
on
a
wind
in
moderate
weather
the
fastest
sailer
i
have
ever
seen
her
qualities
however
as
a
rough
sea-boat
were
not
so
good
and
her
draught
of
water
was
by
far
too
great
for
the
trade
to
which
she
was
destined
for
this
peculiar
service
a
larger
vessel
and
one
of
a
light
proportionate
draught
is
desirable--say
a
vessel
of
from
three
hundred
to
three
hundred
and
fifty
tons
she
should
be
bark-rigged
and
in
other
respects
of
a
different
construction
from
the
usual
south
sea
ships
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
she
should
be
well
armed
she
should
have
say
ten
or
twelve
twelve-pound
carronades
and
two
or
three
long
twelves
with
brass
blunderbusses
and
water-tight
arm-chests
for
each
top
her
anchors
and
cables
should
be
of
far
greater
strength
than
is
required
for
any
other
species
of
trade
and
above
all
her
crew
should
be
numerous
and
efficient--not
less
for
such
a
vessel
as
i
have
described
than
fifty
or
sixty
able-bodied
men
the
jane
guy
had
a
crew
of
thirty-five
all
able
seamen
besides
the
captain
and
mate
but
she
was
not
altogether
as
well
armed
or
otherwise
equipped
as
a
navigator
acquainted
with
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
the
trade
could
have
desired
captain
guy
was
a
gentleman
of
great
urbanity
of
manner
and
of
considerable
experience
in
the
southern
traffic
to
which
he
had
devoted
a
great
portion
of
his
life
he
was
deficient
however
in
energy
and
consequently
in
that
spirit
of
enterprise
which
is
here
so
absolutely
requisite
he
was
part
owner
of
the
vessel
in
which
he
sailed
and
was
invested
with
discretionary
powers
to
cruise
in
the
south
seas
for
any
cargo
which
might
come
most
readily
to
hand
he
had
on
board
as
usual
in
such
voyages
beads
looking-glasses
tinder-works
axes
hatchets
saws
adzes
planes
chisels
gouges
gimlets
files
spokeshaves
rasps
hammers
nails
knives
scissors
razors
needles
thread
crockery-ware
calico
trinkets
and
other
similar
articles
the
schooner
sailed
from
liverpool
on
the
tenth
of
july
crossed
the
tropic
of
cancer
on
the
twenty-fifth
in
longitude
twenty
degrees
west
and
reached
sal
one
of
the
cape
verd
islands
on
the
twenty-ninth
where
she
took
in
salt
and
other
necessaries
for
the
voyage
on
the
third
of
august
she
left
the
cape
verds
and
steered
southwest
stretching
over
toward
the
coast
of
brazil
so
as
to
cross
the
equator
between
the
meridians
of
twenty-eight
and
thirty
degrees
west
longitude
this
is
the
course
usually
taken
by
vessels
bound
from
europe
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
or
by
that
route
to
the
east
indies
by
proceeding
thus
they
avoid
the
calms
and
strong
contrary
currents
which
continually
prevail
on
the
coast
of
guinea
while
in
the
end
it
is
found
to
be
the
shortest
track
as
westerly
winds
are
never
wanting
afterward
by
which
to
reach
the
cape
it
was
captain
guyâ€™s
intention
to
make
his
first
stoppage
at
kerguelenâ€™s
land--i
hardly
know
for
what
reason
on
the
day
we
were
picked
up
the
schooner
was
off
cape
st
roque
in
longitude
thirty-one
degrees
west
so
that
when
found
we
had
drifted
probably
from
north
to
south
not
less
than
five-and-twenty
degrees
on
board
the
jane
guy
we
were
treated
with
all
the
kindness
our
distressed
situation
demanded
in
about
a
fortnight
during
which
time
we
continued
steering
to
the
southeast
with
gentle
breezes
and
fine
weather
both
peters
and
myself
recovered
entirely
from
the
effects
of
our
late
privation
and
dreadful
sufferings
and
we
began
to
remember
what
had
passed
rather
as
a
frightful
dream
from
which
we
had
been
happily
awakened
than
as
events
which
had
taken
place
in
sober
and
naked
reality
i
have
since
found
that
this
species
of
partial
oblivion
is
usually
brought
about
by
sudden
transition
whether
from
joy
to
sorrow
or
from
sorrow
to
joy--the
degree
of
forgetfulness
being
proportioned
to
the
degree
of
difference
in
the
exchange
thus
in
my
own
case
i
now
feel
it
impossible
to
realize
the
full
extent
of
the
misery
which
i
endured
during
the
days
spent
upon
the
hulk
the
incidents
are
remembered
but
not
the
feelings
which
the
incidents
elicited
at
the
time
of
their
occurrence
i
only
know
that
when
they
did
occur
i
then
thought
human
nature
could
sustain
nothing
more
of
agony
we
continued
our
voyage
for
some
weeks
without
any
incidents
of
greater
moment
than
the
occasional
meeting
with
whaling-ships
and
more
frequently
with
the
black
or
right
whale
so
called
in
contradistinction
to
the
spermaceti
these
however
were
chiefly
found
south
of
the
twenty-fifth
parallel
on
the
sixteenth
of
september
being
in
the
vicinity
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
schooner
encountered
her
first
gale
of
any
violence
since
leaving
liverpool
in
this
neighborhood
but
more
frequently
to
the
south
and
east
of
the
promontory
we
were
to
the
westward
navigators
have
often
to
contend
with
storms
from
the
northward
which
rage
with
great
fury
they
always
bring
with
them
a
heavy
sea
and
one
of
their
most
dangerous
features
is
the
instantaneous
chopping
round
of
the
wind
an
occurrence
almost
certain
to
take
place
during
the
greatest
force
of
the
gale
a
perfect
hurricane
will
be
blowing
at
one
moment
from
the
northward
or
northeast
and
in
the
next
not
a
breath
of
wind
will
be
felt
in
that
direction
while
from
the
southwest
it
will
come
out
all
at
once
with
a
violence
almost
inconceivable
a
bright
spot
to
the
southward
is
the
sure
forerunner
of
the
change
and
vessels
are
thus
enabled
to
take
the
proper
precautions
it
was
about
six
in
the
morning
when
the
blow
came
on
with
a
white
squall
and
as
usual
from
the
northward
by
eight
it
had
increased
very
much
and
brought
down
upon
us
one
of
the
most
tremendous
seas
i
had
then
ever
beheld
every
thing
had
been
made
as
snug
as
possible
but
the
schooner
laboured
excessively
and
gave
evidence
of
her
bad
qualities
as
a
seaboat
pitching
her
forecastle
under
at
every
plunge
and
with
the
greatest
difficulty
struggling
up
from
one
wave
before
she
was
buried
in
another
just
before
sunset
the
bright
spot
for
which
we
had
been
on
the
look-out
made
its
appearance
in
the
southwest
and
in
an
hour
afterward
we
perceived
the
little
headsail
we
carried
flapping
listlessly
against
the
mast
in
two
minutes
more
in
spite
of
every
preparation
we
were
hurled
on
our
beam-ends
as
if
by
magic
and
a
perfect
wilderness
of
foam
made
a
clear
breach
over
us
as
we
lay
the
blow
from
the
southwest
however
luckily
proved
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
squall
and
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
right
the
vessel
without
the
loss
of
a
spar
a
heavy
cross
sea
gave
us
great
trouble
for
a
few
hours
after
this
but
toward
morning
we
found
ourselves
in
nearly
as
good
condition
as
before
the
gale
captain
guy
considered
that
he
had
made
an
escape
little
less
than
miraculous
on
the
thirteenth
of
october
we
came
in
sight
of
prince
edwardâ€™s
island
in
latitude
46
degrees
53â€™
s
longitude
37
degrees
46â€™
e
two
days
afterward
we
found
ourselves
near
possession
island
and
presently
passed
the
islands
of
crozet
in
latitude
42
degrees
59â€™
s
longitude
48
degrees
e
on
the
eighteenth
we
made
kerguelenâ€™s
or
desolation
island
in
the
southern
indian
ocean
and
came
to
anchor
in
christmas
harbour
having
four
fathoms
of
water
this
island
or
rather
group
of
islands
bears
southeast
from
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
is
distant
therefrom
nearly
eight
hundred
leagues
it
was
first
discovered
in
1772
by
the
baron
de
kergulen
or
kerguelen
a
frenchman
who
thinking
the
land
to
form
a
portion
of
an
extensive
southern
continent
carried
home
information
to
that
effect
which
produced
much
excitement
at
the
time
the
government
taking
the
matter
up
sent
the
baron
back
in
the
following
year
for
the
purpose
of
giving
his
new
discovery
a
critical
examination
when
the
mistake
was
discovered
in
1777
captain
cook
fell
in
with
the
same
group
and
gave
to
the
principal
one
the
name
of
desolation
island
a
title
which
it
certainly
well
deserves
upon
approaching
the
land
however
the
navigator
might
be
induced
to
suppose
otherwise
as
the
sides
of
most
of
the
hills
from
september
to
march
are
clothed
with
very
brilliant
verdure
this
deceitful
appearance
is
caused
by
a
small
plant
resembling
saxifrage
which
is
abundant
growing
in
large
patches
on
a
species
of
crumbling
moss
besides
this
plant
there
is
scarcely
a
sign
of
vegetation
on
the
island
if
we
except
some
coarse
rank
grass
near
the
harbor
some
lichen
and
a
shrub
which
bears
resemblance
to
a
cabbage
shooting
into
seed
and
which
has
a
bitter
and
acrid
taste
the
face
of
the
country
is
hilly
although
none
of
the
hills
can
be
called
lofty
their
tops
are
perpetually
covered
with
snow
there
are
several
harbors
of
which
christmas
harbour
is
the
most
convenient
it
is
the
first
to
be
met
with
on
the
northeast
side
of
the
island
after
passing
cape
francois
which
forms
the
northern
shore
and
by
its
peculiar
shape
serves
to
distinguish
the
harbour
its
projecting
point
terminates
in
a
high
rock
through
which
is
a
large
hole
forming
a
natural
arch
the
entrance
is
in
latitude
48
degrees
40â€™
s
longitude
69
degrees
6â€™
e
passing
in
here
good
anchorage
may
be
found
under
the
shelter
of
several
small
islands
which
form
a
sufficient
protection
from
all
easterly
winds
proceeding
on
eastwardly
from
this
anchorage
you
come
to
wasp
bay
at
the
head
of
the
harbour
this
is
a
small
basin
completely
landlocked
into
which
you
can
go
with
four
fathoms
and
find
anchorage
in
from
ten
to
three
hard
clay
bottom
a
ship
might
lie
here
with
her
best
bower
ahead
all
the
year
round
without
risk
to
the
westward
at
the
head
of
wasp
bay
is
a
small
stream
of
excellent
water
easily
procured
some
seal
of
the
fur
and
hair
species
are
still
to
be
found
on
kerguelenâ€™s
island
and
sea
elephants
abound
the
feathered
tribes
are
discovered
in
great
numbers
penguins
are
very
plenty
and
of
these
there
are
four
different
kinds
the
royal
penguin
so
called
from
its
size
and
beautiful
plumage
is
the
largest
the
upper
part
of
the
body
is
usually
gray
sometimes
of
a
lilac
tint
the
under
portion
of
the
purest
white
imaginable
the
head
is
of
a
glossy
and
most
brilliant
black
the
feet
also
the
chief
beauty
of
plumage
however
consists
in
two
broad
stripes
of
a
gold
color
which
pass
along
from
the
head
to
the
breast
the
bill
is
long
and
either
pink
or
bright
scarlet
these
birds
walk
erect
with
a
stately
carriage
they
carry
their
heads
high
with
their
wings
drooping
like
two
arms
and
as
their
tails
project
from
their
body
in
a
line
with
the
legs
the
resemblance
to
a
human
figure
is
very
striking
and
would
be
apt
to
deceive
the
spectator
at
a
casual
glance
or
in
the
gloom
of
the
evening
the
royal
penguins
which
we
met
with
on
kerguelenâ€™s
land
were
rather
larger
than
a
goose
the
other
kinds
are
the
macaroni
the
jackass
and
the
rookery
penguin
these
are
much
smaller
less
beautiful
in
plumage
and
different
in
other
respects
besides
the
penguin
many
other
birds
are
here
to
be
found
among
which
may
be
mentioned
sea-hens
blue
peterels
teal
ducks
port
egmont
hens
shags
cape
pigeons
the
nelly
sea
swallows
terns
sea
gulls
mother
careyâ€™s
chickens
mother
careyâ€™s
geese
or
the
great
peterel
and
lastly
the
albatross
the
great
peterel
is
as
large
as
the
common
albatross
and
is
carnivorous
it
is
frequently
called
the
break-bones
or
osprey
peterel
they
are
not
at
all
shy
and
when
properly
cooked
are
palatable
food
in
flying
they
sometimes
sail
very
close
to
the
surface
of
the
water
with
the
wings
expanded
without
appearing
to
move
them
in
the
least
degree
or
make
any
exertion
with
them
whatever
the
albatross
is
one
of
the
largest
and
fiercest
of
the
south
sea
birds
it
is
of
the
gull
species
and
takes
its
prey
on
the
wing
never
coming
on
land
except
for
the
purpose
of
breeding
between
this
bird
and
the
penguin
the
most
singular
friendship
exists
their
nests
are
constructed
with
great
uniformity
upon
a
plan
concerted
between
the
two
species--that
of
the
albatross
being
placed
in
the
centre
of
a
little
square
formed
by
the
nests
of
four
penguins
navigators
have
agreed
in
calling
an
assemblage
of
such
encampments
a
rookery
these
rookeries
have
been
often
described
but
as
my
readers
may
not
all
have
seen
these
descriptions
and
as
i
shall
have
occasion
hereafter
to
speak
of
the
penguin
and
albatross
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
say
something
here
of
their
mode
of
building
and
living
when
the
season
for
incubation
arrives
the
birds
assemble
in
vast
numbers
and
for
some
days
appear
to
be
deliberating
upon
the
proper
course
to
be
pursued
at
length
they
proceed
to
action
a
level
piece
of
ground
is
selected
of
suitable
extent
usually
comprising
three
or
four
acres
and
situated
as
near
the
sea
as
possible
being
still
beyond
its
reach
the
spot
is
chosen
with
reference
to
its
evenness
of
surface
and
that
is
preferred
which
is
the
least
encumbered
with
stones
this
matter
being
arranged
the
birds
proceed
with
one
accord
and
actuated
apparently
by
one
mind
to
trace
out
with
mathematical
accuracy
either
a
square
or
other
parallelogram
as
may
best
suit
the
nature
of
the
ground
and
of
just
sufficient
size
to
accommodate
easily
all
the
birds
assembled
and
no
more--in
this
particular
seeming
determined
upon
preventing
the
access
of
future
stragglers
who
have
not
participated
in
the
labor
of
the
encampment
one
side
of
the
place
thus
marked
out
runs
parallel
with
the
waterâ€™s
edge
and
is
left
open
for
ingress
or
egress
having
defined
the
limits
of
the
rookery
the
colony
now
begin
to
clear
it
of
every
species
of
rubbish
picking
up
stone
by
stone
and
carrying
them
outside
of
the
lines
and
close
by
them
so
as
to
form
a
wall
on
the
three
inland
sides
just
within
this
wall
a
perfectly
level
and
smooth
walk
is
formed
from
six
to
eight
feet
wide
and
extending
around
the
encampment--thus
serving
the
purpose
of
a
general
promenade
the
next
process
is
to
partition
out
the
whole
area
into
small
squares
exactly
equal
in
size
this
is
done
by
forming
narrow
paths
very
smooth
and
crossing
each
other
at
right
angles
throughout
the
entire
extent
of
the
rookery
at
each
intersection
of
these
paths
the
nest
of
an
albatross
is
constructed
and
a
penguinâ€™s
nest
in
the
centre
of
each
square--thus
every
penguin
is
surrounded
by
four
albatrosses
and
each
albatross
by
a
like
number
of
penguins
the
penguinâ€™s
nest
consists
of
a
hole
in
the
earth
very
shallow
being
only
just
of
sufficient
depth
to
keep
her
single
egg
from
rolling
the
albatross
is
somewhat
less
simple
in
her
arrangements
erecting
a
hillock
about
a
foot
high
and
two
in
diameter
this
is
made
of
earth
seaweed
and
shells
on
its
summit
she
builds
her
nest
the
birds
take
especial
care
never
to
leave
their
nests
unoccupied
for
an
instant
during
the
period
of
incubation
or
indeed
until
the
young
progeny
are
sufficiently
strong
to
take
care
of
themselves
while
the
male
is
absent
at
sea
in
search
of
food
the
female
remains
on
duty
and
it
is
only
upon
the
return
of
her
partner
that
she
ventures
abroad
the
eggs
are
never
left
uncovered
at
all--while
one
bird
leaves
the
nest
the
other
nestling
in
by
its
side
this
precaution
is
rendered
necessary
by
the
thieving
propensities
prevalent
in
the
rookery
the
inhabitants
making
no
scruple
to
purloin
each
otherâ€™s
eggs
at
every
good
opportunity
although
there
are
some
rookeries
in
which
the
penguin
and
albatross
are
the
sole
population
yet
in
most
of
them
a
variety
of
oceanic
birds
are
to
be
met
with
enjoying
all
the
privileges
of
citizenship
and
scattering
their
nests
here
and
there
wherever
they
can
find
room
never
interfering
however
with
the
stations
of
the
larger
species
the
appearance
of
such
encampments
when
seen
from
a
distance
is
exceedingly
singular
the
whole
atmosphere
just
above
the
settlement
is
darkened
with
the
immense
number
of
the
albatross
mingled
with
the
smaller
tribes
which
are
continually
hovering
over
it
either
going
to
the
ocean
or
returning
home
at
the
same
time
a
crowd
of
penguins
are
to
be
observed
some
passing
to
and
fro
in
the
narrow
alleys
and
some
marching
with
the
military
strut
so
peculiar
to
them
around
the
general
promenade
ground
which
encircles
the
rookery
in
short
survey
it
as
we
will
nothing
can
be
more
astonishing
than
the
spirit
of
reflection
evinced
by
these
feathered
beings
and
nothing
surely
can
be
better
calculated
to
elicit
reflection
in
every
well-regulated
human
intellect
on
the
morning
after
our
arrival
in
christmas
harbour
the
chief
mate
mr
patterson
took
the
boats
and
although
it
was
somewhat
early
in
the
season
went
in
search
of
seal
leaving
the
captain
and
a
young
relation
of
his
on
a
point
of
barren
land
to
the
westward
they
having
some
business
whose
nature
i
could
not
ascertain
to
transact
in
the
interior
of
the
island
captain
guy
took
with
him
a
bottle
in
which
was
a
sealed
letter
and
made
his
way
from
the
point
on
which
he
was
set
on
shore
toward
one
of
the
highest
peaks
in
the
place
it
is
probable
that
his
design
was
to
leave
the
letter
on
that
height
for
some
vessel
which
he
expected
to
come
after
him
as
soon
as
we
lost
sight
of
him
we
proceeded
peters
and
myself
being
in
the
mateâ€™s
boat
on
our
cruise
around
the
coast
looking
for
seal
in
this
business
we
were
occupied
about
three
weeks
examining
with
great
care
every
nook
and
corner
not
only
of
kerguelenâ€™s
land
but
of
the
several
small
islands
in
the
vicinity
our
labours
however
were
not
crowned
with
any
important
success
we
saw
a
great
many
fur
seal
but
they
were
exceedingly
shy
and
with
the
greatest
exertions
we
could
only
procure
three
hundred
and
fifty
skins
in
all
sea
elephants
were
abundant
especially
on
the
western
coast
of
the
mainland
but
of
these
we
killed
only
twenty
and
this
with
great
difficulty
on
the
smaller
islands
we
discovered
a
good
many
of
the
hair
seal
but
did
not
molest
them
we
returned
to
the
schooner
on
the
eleventh
where
we
found
captain
guy
and
his
nephew
who
gave
a
very
bad
account
of
the
interior
representing
it
as
one
of
the
most
dreary
and
utterly
barren
countries
in
the
world
they
had
remained
two
nights
on
the
island
owing
to
some
misunderstanding
on
the
part
of
the
second
mate
in
regard
to
the
sending
a
jollyboat
from
the
schooner
to
take
them
off
on
the
twelfth
we
made
sail
from
christmas
harbour
retracing
our
way
to
the
westward
and
leaving
marionâ€™s
island
one
of
crozetâ€™s
group
on
the
larboard
we
afterward
passed
prince
edwardâ€™s
island
leaving
it
also
on
our
left
then
steering
more
to
the
northward
made
in
fifteen
days
the
islands
of
tristan
dâ€™acunha
in
latitude
37
degrees

so
well
known

which
consists
of
three
circular

first
discovered
by
the
portuguese
and
was
visited
afterward
by
the
dutch
in
1643
and
by
the
french
in
1767
the
three
islands
together
form
a
triangle
and
are
distant
from
each
other

ten
miles

fine
open
passages

properly
so
called

is
the
largest
of
the
group
being
fifteen
miles
in
circumference
and
so
elevated
that
it
can
be
seen
in
clear
weather
at
the
distance
of
eighty
or
ninety
miles
a
part
of
the
land
toward
the
north
rises
more
than
a
thousand
feet
perpendicularly
from
the
sea
a
tableland
at
this
height
extends
back
nearly
to
the
centre
of
the
island
and
from
this
tableland
arises
a
lofty
cone
like
that
of
teneriffe
the
lower
half
of
this
cone
is
clothed
with
trees
of
good
size
but
the
upper
region
is
barren
rock
usually
hidden
among
the
clouds
and
covered
with
snow
during
the
greater
part
of
the
year
there
are
no
shoals
or
other
dangers
about
the
island
the
shores
being
remarkably
bold
and
the
water
deep
on
the
northwestern
coast
is
a
bay
with
a
beach
of
black
sand
where
a
landing
with
boats
can
be
easily
effected
provided
there

here
be
readily
procured

together
with
a
great
variety
of

whales
are
also
plenty
in
their

owing
to
the
ease
with
which
these
various
animals
were
here
formerly
taken
the
group
has
been
much
visited
since
its
discovery
the
dutch
and
french
frequented
it
at
a
very
early
period
in
1790
captain
patten
of
the
ship
industry
of
philadelphia
made
tristan
dâ€™acunha
where
he
remained
seven
months
from
august
1790
to
april
1791
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
sealskins
in
this
time
he
gathered
no
less
than
five
thousand
six
hundred
and
says
that
he
would
have
had
no
difficulty
in
loading
a
large
ship
with
oil
in
three
weeks
upon
his
arrival
he
found
no
quadrupeds
with
the
exception
of
a
few
wild
goats
the
island
now
abounds
with
all
our
most
valuable
domestic
animals
which
have
been
introduced
by
subsequent
navigators
i
believe
it
was
not
long
after
captain
pattenâ€™s
visit
that
captain
colquhoun
of
the
american
brig
betsey
touched
at
the
largest
of
the
islands
for
the
purpose
of
refreshment
he
planted
onions
potatoes
cabbages
and
a
great
many
other
vegetables
an
abundance
of
all
which
is
now
to
be
met
with
in
1811
a
captain
haywood
in
the
nereus
visited
tristan
he
found
there
three
americans
who
were
residing
upon
the
island
to
prepare
sealskins
and
oil
one
of
these
men
was
named
jonathan
lambert
and
he
called
himself
the
sovereign
of
the
country
he
had
cleared
and
cultivated
about
sixty
acres
of
land
and
turned
his
attention
to
raising
the
coffee-plant
and
sugar-cane
with
which
he
had
been
furnished
by
the
american
minister
at
rio
janeiro
this
settlement
however
was
finally
abandoned
and
in
1817
the
islands
were
taken
possession
of
by
the
british
government
who
sent
a
detachment
for
that
purpose
from
the
cape
of
good
hope
they
did
not
however
retain
them
long
but
upon
the
evacuation
of
the
country
as
a
british
possession
two
or
three
english
families
took
up
their
residence
there
independently
of
the
government
on
the
twenty-fifth
of
march
1824
the
berwick
captain
jeffrey
from
london
to
van
diemenâ€™s
land
arrived
at
the
place
where
they
found
an
englishman
of
the
name
of
glass
formerly
a
corporal
in
the
british
artillery
he
claimed
to
be
supreme
governor
of
the
islands
and
had
under
his
control
twenty-one
men
and
three
women
he
gave
a
very
favourable
account
of
the
salubrity
of
the
climate
and
of
the
productiveness
of
the
soil
the
population
occupied
themselves
chiefly
in
collecting
sealskins
and
sea
elephant
oil
with
which
they
traded
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
glass
owning
a
small
schooner
at
the
period
of
our
arrival
the
governor
was
still
a
resident
but
his
little
community
had
multiplied
there
being
fifty-six
persons
upon
tristan
besides
a
smaller
settlement
of
seven
on
nightingale
island
we
had
no
difficulty
in
procuring
almost
every
kind
of
refreshment
which
we
required--sheep
hogs
bullocks
rabbits
poultry
goats
fish
in
great
variety
and
vegetables
were
abundant
having
come
to
anchor
close
in
with
the
large
island
in
eighteen
fathoms
we
took
all
we
wanted
on
board
very
conveniently
captain
guy
also
purchased
of
glass
five
hundred
sealskins
and
some
ivory
we
remained
here
a
week
during
which
the
prevailing
winds
were
from
the
northward
and
westward
and
the
weather
somewhat
hazy
on
the
fifth
of
november
we
made
sail
to
the
southward
and
westward
with
the
intention
of
having
a
thorough
search
for
a
group
of
islands
called
the
auroras
respecting
whose
existence
a
great
diversity
of
opinion
has
existed
these
islands
are
said
to
have
been
discovered
as
early
as
1762
by
the
commander
of
the
ship
aurora
in
1790
captain
manuel
de
oyarvido
in
the
ship
princess
belonging
to
the
royal
philippine
company
sailed
as
he
asserts
directly
among
them
in
1794
the
spanish
corvette
atrevida
went
with
the
determination
of
ascertaining
their
precise
situation
and
in
a
paper
published
by
the
royal
hydrographical
society
of
madrid
in
the
year
1809
the
following
language
is
used
respecting
this
expedition
â€œthe
corvette
atrevida
practised
in
their
immediate
vicinity
from
the
twenty-first
to
the
twenty-seventh
of
january
all
the
necessary
observations
and
measured
by
chronometers
the
difference
of
longitude
between
these
islands
and
the
port
of
soledad
in
the
manillas
the
islands
are
three
they
are
very
nearly
in
the
same
meridian
the
centre
one
is
rather
low
and
the
other
two
may
be
seen
at
nine
leaguesâ€™
distanceâ€
the
observations
made
on
board
the
atrevida
give
the
following
results
as
the
precise
situation
of

1820
captain
james
weddel
of
the
british
navy
sailed
from
staten
land
also
in
search
of
the
auroras
he
reports
that
having
made
the
most
diligent
search
and
passed
not
only
immediately
over
the
spots
indicated
by
the
commander
of
the
atrevida
but
in
every
direction
throughout
the
vicinity
of
these
spots
he
could
discover
no
indication
of
land
these
conflicting
statements
have
induced
other
navigators
to
look
out
for
the
islands
and
strange
to
say
while
some
have
sailed
through
every
inch
of
sea
where
they
are
supposed
to
lie
without
finding
them
there
have
been
not
a
few
who
declare
positively
that
they
have
seen
them
and
even
been
close
in
with
their
shores
it
was
captain
guyâ€™s
intention
to
make
every
exertion
within
his
power
to
settle
the
question
so
oddly
in
dispute

we
kept
on
our
course
between
the
south
and
west
with
variable
weather
until
the
twentieth
of
the
month
when
we
found
ourselves
on
the
debated
ground
being
in
latitude
53
degrees
15â€™
s
longitude
47
degrees
58â€™
w--that
is
to
say
very
nearly
upon
the
spot
indicated
as
the
situation
of
the
most
southern
of
the
group
not
perceiving
any
sign
of
land
we
continued
to
the
westward
of
the
parallel
of
fifty-three
degrees
south
as
far
as
the
meridian
of
fifty
degrees
west
we
then
stood
to
the
north
as
far
as
the
parallel
of
fifty-two
degrees
south
when
we
turned
to
the
eastward
and
kept
our
parallel
by
double
altitudes
morning
and
evening
and
meridian
altitudes
of
the
planets
and
moon
having
thus
gone
eastwardly
to
the
meridian
of
the
western
coast
of
georgia
we
kept
that
meridian
until
we
were
in
the
latitude
from
which
we
set
out
we
then
took
diagonal
courses
throughout
the
entire
extent
of
sea
circumscribed
keeping
a
lookout
constantly
at
the
masthead
and
repeating
our
examination
with
the
greatest
care
for
a
period
of
three
weeks
during
which
the
weather
was
remarkably
pleasant
and
fair
with
no
haze
whatsoever
of
course
we
were
thoroughly
satisfied
that
whatever
islands
might
have
existed
in
this
vicinity
at
any
former
period
no
vestige
of
them
remained
at
the
present
day
since
my
return
home
i
find
that
the
same
ground
was
traced
over
with
equal
care
in
1822
by
captain
johnson
of
the
american
schooner
henry
and
by
captain
morrell
in
the
american
schooner
wasp--in
both
cases
with
the
same
result
as
in
our
own
it
had
been
captain
guyâ€™s
original
intention
after
satisfying
himself
about
the
auroras
to
proceed
through
the
strait
of
magellan
and
up
along
the
western
coast
of
patagonia
but
information
received
at
tristan
dâ€™acunha
induced
him
to
steer
to
the
southward
in
the
hope
of
falling
in
with
some
small
islands
said
to
lie
about
the
parallel
of
60
degrees
s
longitude
41
degrees
20â€™
w
in
the
event
of
his
not
discovering
these
lands
he
designed
should
the
season
prove
favourable
to
push
on
toward
the
pole
accordingly
on
the
twelfth
of
december
we
made
sail
in
that
direction
on
the
eighteenth
we
found
ourselves
about
the
station
indicated
by
glass
and
cruised
for
three
days
in
that
neighborhood
without
finding
any
traces
of
the
islands
he
had
mentioned
on
the
twenty-first
the
weather
being
unusually
pleasant
we
again
made
sail
to
the
southward
with
the
resolution
of
penetrating
in
that
course
as
far
as
possible
before
entering
upon
this
portion
of
my
narrative
it
may
be
as
well
for
the
information
of
those
readers
who
have
paid
little
attention
to
the
progress
of
discovery
in
these
regions
to
give
some
brief
account
of
the
very
few
attempts
at
reaching
the
southern
pole
which
have
hitherto
been
made
that
of
captain
cook
was
the
first
of
which
we
have
any
distinct
account
in
1772
he
sailed
to
the
south
in
the
resolution
accompanied
by
lieutenant
furneaux
in
the
adventure
in
december
he
found
himself
as
far
as
the
fifty-eighth
parallel
of
south
latitude
and
in
longitude
26
degrees
57â€™
e
here
he
met
with
narrow
fields
of
ice
about
eight
or
ten
inches
thick
and
running
northwest
and
southeast
this
ice
was
in
large
cakes
and
usually
it
was
packed
so
closely
that
the
vessel
had
great
difficulty
in
forcing
a
passage
at
this
period
captain
cook
supposed
from
the
vast
number
of
birds
to
be
seen
and
from
other
indications
that
he
was
in
the
near
vicinity
of
land
he
kept
on
to
the
southward
the
weather
being
exceedingly
cold
until
he
reached
the
sixty-fourth
parallel
in
longitude
38
degrees
14â€™
e
here
he
had
mild
weather
with
gentle
breezes
for
five
days
the
thermometer
being
at
thirty-six
in
january
1773
the
vessels
crossed
the
antarctic
circle
but
did
not
succeed
in
penetrating
much
farther
for
upon
reaching
latitude
67
degrees
15â€™
they
found
all
farther
progress
impeded
by
an
immense
body
of
ice
extending
all
along
the
southern
horizon
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
this
ice
was
of
every
variety--and
some
large
floes
of
it
miles
in
extent
formed
a
compact
mass
rising
eighteen
or
twenty
feet
above
the
water
it
being
late
in
the
season
and
no
hope
entertained
of
rounding
these
obstructions
captain
cook
now
reluctantly
turned
to
the
northward
in
the
november
following
he
renewed
his
search
in
the
antarctic
in
latitude
59
degrees
40â€™
he
met
with
a
strong
current
setting
to
the
southward
in
december
when
the
vessels
were
in
latitude
67
degrees
31â€™
longitude
142
degrees
54â€™
w
the
cold
was
excessive
with
heavy
gales
and
fog
here
also
birds
were
abundant
the
albatross
the
penguin
and
the
peterel
especially
in
latitude
70
degrees
23â€™
some
large
islands
of
ice
were
encountered
and
shortly
afterward
the
clouds
to
the
southward
were
observed
to
be
of
a
snowy
whiteness
indicating
the
vicinity
of
field
ice
in
latitude
71
degrees
10â€™
longitude
106
degrees
54â€™
w
the
navigators
were
stopped
as
before
by
an
immense
frozen
expanse
which
filled
the
whole
area
of
the
southern
horizon
the
northern
edge
of
this
expanse
was
ragged
and
broken
so
firmly
wedged
together
as
to
be
utterly
impassible
and
extending
about
a
mile
to
the
southward
behind
it
the
frozen
surface
was
comparatively
smooth
for
some
distance
until
terminated
in
the
extreme
background
by
gigantic
ranges
of
ice
mountains
the
one
towering
above
the
other
captain
cook
concluded
that
this
vast
field
reached
the
southern
pole
or
was
joined
to
a
continent
mr
j
n
reynolds
whose
great
exertions
and
perseverance
have
at
length
succeeded
in
getting
set
on
foot
a
national
expedition
partly
for
the
purpose
of
exploring
these
regions
thus
speaks
of
the
attempt
of
the
resolution
â€œwe
are
not
surprised
that
captain
cook
was
unable
to
go
beyond
71
degrees
10â€™
but
we
are
astonished
that
he
did
attain
that
point
on
the
meridian
of
106
degrees
54â€™
west
longitude
palmerâ€™s
land
lies
south
of
the
shetland
latitude
sixty-four
degrees
and
tends
to
the
southward
and
westward
farther
than
any
navigator
has
yet
penetrated
cook
was
standing
for
this
land
when
his
progress
was
arrested
by
the
ice
which
we
apprehend
must
always
be
the
case
in
that
point
and
so
early
in
the
season
as
the
sixth
of
january--and
we
should
not
be
surprised
if
a
portion
of
the
icy
mountains
described
was
attached
to
the
main
body
of
palmerâ€™s
land
or
to
some
other
portions
of
land
lying
farther
to
the
southward
and
westwardâ€
in
1803
captains
kreutzenstern
and
lisiausky
were
dispatched
by
alexander
of
russia
for
the
purpose
of
circumnavigating
the
globe
in
endeavouring
to
get
south
they
made
no
farther
than
59
degrees
58â€™
in
longitude
70
degrees
15â€™
w
they
here
met
with
strong
currents
setting
eastwardly
whales
were
abundant
but
they
saw
no
ice
in
regard
to
this
voyage
mr
reynolds
observes
that
if
kreutzenstern
had
arrived
where
he
did
earlier
in
the
season
he
must
have
encountered
ice--it
was
march
when
he
reached
the
latitude
specified
the
winds
prevailing
as
they
do
from
the
southward
and
westward
had
carried
the
floes
aided
by
currents
into
that
icy
region
bounded
on
the
north
by
georgia
east
by
sandwich
land
and
the
south
orkneys
and
west
by
the
south
shetland
islands
in
1822
captain
james
weddell
of
the
british
navy
with
two
very
small
vessels
penetrated
farther
to
the
south
than
any
previous
navigator
and
this
too
without
encountering
extraordinary
difficulties
he
states
that
although
he
was
frequently
hemmed
in
by
ice
before
reaching
the
seventy-second
parallel
yet
upon
attaining
it
not
a
particle
was
to
be
discovered
and
that
upon
arriving
at
the
latitude
of
74
degrees
15â€™
no
fields
and
only
three
islands
of
ice
were
visible
it
is
somewhat
remarkable
that
although
vast
flocks
of
birds
were
seen
and
other
usual
indications
of
land
and
although
south
of
the
shetlands
unknown
coasts
were
observed
from
the
masthead
tending
southwardly
weddell
discourages
the
idea
of
land
existing
in
the
polar
regions
of
the
south
on
the
11th
of
january
1823
captain
benjamin
morrell
of
the
american
schooner
wasp
sailed
from
kerguelenâ€™s
land
with
a
view
of
penetrating
as
far
south
as
possible
on
the
first
of
february
he
found
himself
in
latitude
64
degrees
52â€™
s
longitude
118
degrees
27â€™
e
the
following
passage
is
extracted
from
his
journal
of
that
date
â€œthe
wind
soon
freshened
to
an
eleven-knot
breeze
and
we
embraced
this
opportunity
of
making
to
the
west
being
however
convinced
that
the
farther
we
went
south
beyond
latitude
sixty-four
degrees
the
less
ice
was
to
be
apprehended
we
steered
a
little
to
the
southward
until
we
crossed
the
antarctic
circle
and
were
in
latitude
69
degrees
15â€™
e
in
this
latitude
there
was
no
field
ice
and
very
few
ice
islands
in
sightâ€
under
the
date
of
march
fourteenth
i
find
also
this
entry
â€œthe
sea
was
now
entirely
free
of
field
ice
and
there
were
not
more
than
a
dozen
ice
islands
in
sight
at
the
same
time
the
temperature
of
the
air
and
water
was
at
least
thirteen
degrees
higher
more
mild
than
we
had
ever
found
it
between
the
parallels
of
sixty
and
sixty-two
south
we
were
now
in
latitude
70
degrees
14â€™
s
and
the
temperature
of
the
air
was
forty-seven
and
that
of
the
water
forty-four
in
this
situation
i
found
the
variation
to
be
14
degrees
27â€™
easterly
per
azimuth
i
have
several
times
passed
within
the
antarctic
circle
on
different
meridians
and
have
uniformly
found
the
temperature
both
of
the
air
and
the
water
to
become
more
and
more
mild
the
farther
i
advanced
beyond
the
sixty-fifth
degree
of
south
latitude
and
that
the
variation
decreases
in
the
same
proportion
while
north
of
this
latitude
say
between
sixty
and
sixty-five
south
we
frequently
had
great
difficulty
in
finding
a
passage
for
the
vessel
between
the
immense
and
almost
innumerable
ice
islands
some
of
which
were
from
one
to
two
miles
in
circumference
and
more
than
five
hundred
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
waterâ€
being
nearly
destitute
of
fuel
and
water
and
without
proper
instruments
it
being
also
late
in
the
season
captain
morrell
was
now
obliged
to
put
back
without
attempting
any
further
progress
to
the
westward
although
an
entirely
open
sea
lay
before
him
he
expresses
the
opinion
that
had
not
these
overruling
considerations
obliged
him
to
retreat
he
could
have
penetrated
if
not
to
the
pole
itself
at
least
to
the
eighty-fifth
parallel
i
have
given
his
ideas
respecting
these
matters
somewhat
at
length
that
the
reader
may
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
how
far
they
were
borne
out
by
my
own
subsequent
experience
in
1831
captain
briscoe
in
the
employ
of
the
messieurs
enderby
whale-ship
owners
of
london
sailed
in
the
brig
lively
for
the
south
seas
accompanied
by
the
cutter
tula
on
the
twenty-eighth
of
february
being
in
latitude
66
degrees
30â€™
s
longitude
47
degrees
31â€™
e
he
descried
land
and
â€œclearly
discovered
through
the
snow
the
black
peaks
of
a
range
of
mountains
running
e
s
eâ€
he
remained
in
this
neighbourhood
during
the
whole
of
the
following
month
but
was
unable
to
approach
the
coast
nearer
than
within
ten
leagues
owing
to
the
boisterous
state
of
the
weather
finding
it
impossible
to
make
further
discovery
during
this
season
he
returned
northward
to
winter
in
van
diemenâ€™s
land
in
the
beginning
of
1832
he
again
proceeded
southwardly
and
on
the
fourth
of
february
land
was
seen
to
the
southeast
in
latitude
67
degrees
15â€™
longitude
69
degrees
29â€™
w
this
was
soon
found
to
be
an
island
near
the
headland
of
the
country
he
had
first
discovered
on
the
twenty-first
of
the
month
he
succeeded
in
landing
on
the
latter
and
took
possession
of
it
in
the
name
of
william
iv
calling
it
adelaideâ€™s
island
in
honour
of
the
english
queen
these
particulars
being
made
known
to
the
royal
geographical
society
of
london
the
conclusion
was
drawn
by
that
body
â€œthat
there
is
a
continuous
tract
of
land
extending
from
47
degrees
30â€™
e
to
69
degrees
29â€™
w
longitude
running
the
parallel
of
from
sixty-six
to
sixty-seven
degrees
south
latitudeâ€
in
respect
to
this
conclusion
mr
reynolds
observes
â€œin
the
correctness
of
it
we
by
no
means
concur
nor
do
the
discoveries
of
briscoe
warrant
any
such
indifference
it
was
within
these
limits
that
weddel
proceeded
south
on
a
meridian
to
the
east
of
georgia
sandwich
land
and
the
south
orkney
and
shetland
islandsâ€
my
own
experience
will
be
found
to
testify
most
directly
to
the
falsity
of
the
conclusion
arrived
at
by
the
society
these
are
the
principal
attempts
which
have
been
made
at
penetrating
to
a
high
southern
latitude
and
it
will
now
be
seen
that
there
remained
previous
to
the
voyage
of
the
jane
nearly
three
hundred
degrees
of
longitude
in
which
the
antarctic
circle
had
not
been
crossed
at
all
of
course
a
wide
field
lay
before
us
for
discovery
and
it
was
with
feelings
of
most
intense
interest
that
i
heard
captain
guy
express
his
resolution
of
pushing
boldly
to
the
southward
we
kept
our
course
southwardly
for
four
days
after
giving
up
the
search
for
glassâ€™s
islands
without
meeting
with
any
ice
at
all
on
the
twenty-sixth
at
noon
we
were
in
latitude
63
degrees
23â€™
s
longitude
41
degrees
25â€™

we
now
saw
several
large
ice
islands
and
a
floe
of
field
ice
not
however
of
any
great
extent
the
winds
generally
blew
from
the
southeast
or
the
northeast
but
were
very
light
whenever
we
had
a
westerly
wind
which
was
seldom
it
was
invariably
attended
with
a
rain
squall
every
day
we
had
more
or
less
snow
the
thermometer

the
twenty-seventh
stood
at
thirty-five
january
1
1828--this
day
we
found
ourselves
completely
hemmed
in
by
the
ice
and
our
prospects
looked
cheerless
indeed
a
strong
gale
blew
during
the
whole
forenoon
from
the
northeast
and
drove
large
cakes
of
the
drift
against
the
rudder
and
counter
with
such
violence
that
we
all
trembled
for
the
consequences
toward
evening
the
gale
still
blowing
with
fury
a
large
field
in
front
separated
and
we
were
enabled
by
carrying
a
press
of
sail
to
force
a
passage
through
the
smaller
flakes
into
some
open
water
beyond
as
we
approached
this
space
we
took
in
sail
by
degrees
and
having
at
length
got
clear
lay-to
under
a
single
reefed
foresail
january
2--we
had
now
tolerably
pleasant
weather
at
noon
we
found
ourselves
in
latitude
69
degrees
10â€™
s
longitude
42
degrees
20â€™
w
having
crossed
the
antarctic
circle
very
little
ice
was
to
be
seen
to
the
southward
although
large
fields
of
it
lay
behind
us
this
day
we
rigged
some
sounding
gear
using
a
large
iron
pot
capable
of
holding
twenty
gallons
and
a
line
of
two
hundred
fathoms

found
the
current
setting
to
the
north
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile

hour

temperature
of
the
air
was
now
about
thirty-three

we
found
the
variation
to
be
14
degrees
28â€™
easterly
per
azimuth
january
5--we
had
still
held
on
to
the
southward
without
any
very
great
impediments
on
this
morning
however
being
in
latitude
73
degrees
15â€™
e
longitude
42
degrees
10â€™
w
we
were
again
brought
to
a
stand
by
an
immense
expanse
of
firm
ice
we
saw
nevertheless
much
open
water
to
the
southward
and
felt
no
doubt
of
being
able
to
reach
it
eventually
standing
to
the
eastward
along
the
edge
of
the
floe
we
at
length
came
to
a
passage
of
about
a
mile
in
width
through
which
we
warped
our
way
by
sundown
the
sea
in
which
we
now
were
was
thickly
covered
with
ice
islands
but
had
no
field
ice
and
we
pushed
on
boldly
as
before
the
cold
did
not
seem
to
increase
although
we
had
snow
very
frequently
and
now
and
then
hail
squalls
of
great
violence
immense
flocks
of
the
albatross
flew
over
the
schooner
this
day
going
from
southeast
to
northwest
january
7--the
sea
still
remained
pretty
well
open
so
that
we
had
no
difficulty
in
holding
on
our
course
to
the
westward
we
saw
some
icebergs
of
incredible
size
and
in
the
afternoon
passed
very
near
one
whose
summit
could
not
have
been
less
than
four
hundred
fathoms
from
the
surface
of
the
ocean
its
girth
was
probably
at
the
base
three-quarters
of
a
league
and
several
streams
of
water
were
running
from
crevices
in
its
sides
we
remained
in
sight
of
this
island
two
days
and
then
only
lost
it
in
a
fog
january
10--early
this
morning
we
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
a
man
overboard
he
was
an
american
named
peter
vredenburgh
a
native
of
new
york
and
was
one
of
the
most
valuable
hands
on
board
the
schooner
in
going
over
the
bows
his
foot
slipped
and
he
fell
between
two
cakes
of
ice
never
rising
again
at
noon
of
this
day
we
were
in
latitude
78
degrees
30â€™
longitude
40
degrees
15â€™
w
the
cold
was
now
excessive
and
we
had
hail
squalls
continually
from
the
northward
and
eastward
in
this
direction
also
we
saw
several
more
immense
icebergs
and
the
whole
horizon
to
the
eastward
appeared
to
be
blocked
up
with
field
ice
rising
in
tiers
one
mass
above
the
other
some
driftwood
floated
by
during
the
evening
and
a
great
quantity
of
birds
flew
over
among
which
were
nellies
peterels
albatrosses
and
a
large
bird
of
a
brilliant
blue
plumage
the
variation
here
per
azimuth
was
less
than
it
had
been
previously
to
our
passing
the
antarctic
circle
january
12--our
passage
to
the
south
again
looked
doubtful
as
nothing
was
to
be
seen
in
the
direction
of
the
pole
but
one
apparently
limitless
floe
backed
by
absolute
mountains
of
ragged
ice
one
precipice
of
which
arose
frowningly
above
the
other
we
stood
to
the
westward
until
the
fourteenth
in
the
hope
of
finding
an
entrance
january
14--this
morning
we
reached
the
western
extremity
of
the
field
which
had
impeded
us
and
weathering
it
came
to
an
open
sea
without
a
particle
of
ice
upon
sounding
with
two
hundred
fathoms
we
here
found
a
current
setting
southwardly
at
the
rate
of
half
a
mile
per
hour
the
temperature
of
the
air
was
forty-seven
that
of
the
water
thirty-four
we
now
sailed
to
the
southward
without
meeting
any
interruption
of
moment
until
the
sixteenth
when
at
noon
we
were
in
latitude
81
degrees
21â€™
longitude
42
degrees
w
we
here
again
sounded
and
found
a
current
setting
still
southwardly
and
at
the
rate
of
three
quarters
of
a
mile
per
hour
the
variation
per
azimuth
had
diminished
and
the
temperature
of
the
air
was
mild
and
pleasant
the
thermometer
being
as
high
as
fifty-one
at
this
period
not
a
particle
of
ice
was
to
be
discovered
all
hands
on
board
now
felt
certain
of
attaining
the
pole
january
17--this
day
was
full
of
incident
innumerable
flights
of
birds
flew
over
us
from
the
southward
and
several
were
shot
from
the
deck
one
of
them
a
species
of
pelican
proved
to
be
excellent
eating
about
midday
a
small
floe
of
ice
was
seen
from
the
masthead
off
the
larboard
bow
and
upon
it
there
appeared
to
be
some
large
animal
as
the
weather
was
good
and
nearly
calm
captain
guy
ordered
out
two
of
the
boats
to
see
what
it
was
dirk
peters
and
myself
accompanied
the
mate
in
the
larger
boat
upon
coming
up
with
the
floe
we
perceived
that
it
was
in
the
possession
of
a
gigantic
creature
of
the
race
of
the
arctic
bear
but
far
exceeding
in
size
the
largest
of
these
animals
being
well
armed
we
made
no
scruple
of
attacking
it
at
once
several
shots
were
fired
in
quick
succession
the
most
of
which
took
effect
apparently
in
the
head
and
body
nothing
discouraged
however
the
monster
threw
himself
from
the
ice
and
swam
with
open
jaws
to
the
boat
in
which
were
peters
and
myself
owing
to
the
confusion
which
ensued
among
us
at
this
unexpected
turn
of
the
adventure
no
person
was
ready
immediately
with
a
second
shot
and
the
bear
had
actually
succeeded
in
getting
half
his
vast
bulk
across
our
gunwale
and
seizing
one
of
the
men
by
the
small
of
his
back
before
any
efficient
means
were
taken
to
repel
him
in
this
extremity
nothing
but
the
promptness
and
agility
of
peters
saved
us
from
destruction
leaping
upon
the
back
of
the
huge
beast
he
plunged
the
blade
of
a
knife
behind
the
neck
reaching
the
spinal
marrow
at
a
blow
the
brute
tumbled
into
the
sea
lifeless
and
without
a
struggle
rolling
over
peters
as
he
fell
the
latter
soon
recovered
himself
and
a
rope
being
thrown
him
he
secured
the
carcass
before
entering
the
boat
we
then
returned
in
triumph
to
the
schooner
towing
our
trophy
behind
us
this
bear
upon
admeasurement
proved
to
be
full
fifteen
feet
in
his
greatest
length
his
wool
was
perfectly
white
and
very
coarse
curling
tightly
the
eyes
were
of
a
blood
red
and
larger
than
those
of
the
arctic
bear
the
snout
also
more
rounded
rather
resembling
the
snout
of
the
bulldog
the
meat
was
tender
but
excessively
rank
and
fishy
although
the
men
devoured
it
with
avidity
and
declared
it
excellent
eating
scarcely
had
we
got
our
prize
alongside
when
the
man
at
the
masthead
gave
the
joyful
shout
of
â€œland
on
the
starboard
bowâ€
all
hands
were
now
upon
the
alert
and
a
breeze
springing
up
very
opportunely
from
the
northward
and
eastward
we
were
soon
close
in
with
the
coast
it
proved
to
be
a
low
rocky
islet
of
about
a
league
in
circumference
and
altogether
destitute
of
vegetation
if
we
except
a
species
of
prickly
pear
in
approaching
it
from
the
northward
a
singular
ledge
of
rock
is
seen
projecting
into
the
sea
and
bearing
a
strong
resemblance
to
corded
bales
of
cotton
around
this
ledge
to
the
westward
is
a
small
bay
at
the
bottom
of
which
our
boats
effected
a
convenient
landing
it
did
not
take
us
long
to
explore
every
portion
of
the
island
but
with
one
exception
we
found
nothing
worthy
of
our
observation
in
the
southern
extremity
we
picked
up
near
the
shore
half
buried
in
a
pile
of
loose
stones
a
piece
of
wood
which
seemed
to
have
formed
the
prow
of
a
canoe
there
had
been
evidently
some
attempt
at
carving
upon
it
and
captain
guy
fancied
that
he
made
out
the
figure
of
a
tortoise
but
the
resemblance
did
not
strike
me
very
forcibly
besides
this
prow
if
such
it
were
we
found
no
other
token
that
any
living
creature
had
ever
been
here
before
around
the
coast
we
discovered
occasional
small
floes
of
ice--but
these
were
very
few
the
exact
situation
of
the
islet
to
which
captain
guy
gave
the
name
of
bennetâ€™s
islet
in
honour
of
his
partner
in
the
ownership
of
the
schooner
is
82
degrees
50â€™
s
latitude
42
degrees
20â€™
w
longitude
we
had
now
advanced
to
the
southward
more
than
eight
degrees
farther
than
any
previous
navigators
and
the
sea
still
lay
perfectly
open
before
us
we
found
too
that
the
variation
uniformly
decreased
as
we
proceeded
and
what
was
still
more
surprising
that
the
temperature
of
the
air
and
latterly
of
the
water
became
milder
the
weather
might
even
be
called
pleasant
and
we
had
a
steady
but
very
gentle
breeze
always
from
some
northern
point
of
the
compass
the
sky
was
usually
clear
with
now
and
then
a
slight
appearance
of
thin
vapour
in
the
southern
horizon--this
however
was
invariably
of
brief
duration
two
difficulties
alone
presented
themselves
to
our
view
we
were
getting
short
of
fuel
and
symptoms
of
scurvy
had
occurred
among
several
of
the
crew
these
considerations
began
to
impress
upon
captain
guy
the
necessity
of
returning
and
he
spoke
of
it
frequently
for
my
own
part
confident
as
i
was
of
soon
arriving
at
land
of
some
description
upon
the
course
we
were
pursuing
and
having
every
reason
to
believe
from
present
appearances
that
we
should
not
find
it
the
sterile
soil
met
with
in
the
higher
arctic
latitudes
i
warmly
pressed
upon
him
the
expediency
of
persevering
at
least
for
a
few
days
longer
in
the
direction
we
were
now
holding
so
tempting
an
opportunity
of
solving
the
great
problem
in
regard
to
an
antarctic
continent
had
never
yet
been
afforded
to
man
and
i
confess
that
i
felt
myself
bursting
with
indignation
at
the
timid
and
ill-timed
suggestions
of
our
commander
i
believe
indeed
that
what
i
could
not
refrain
from
saying
to
him
on
this
head
had
the
effect
of
inducing
him
to
push
on
while
therefore
i
cannot
but
lament
the
most
unfortunate
and
bloody
events
which
immediately
arose
from
my
advice
i
must
still
be
allowed
to
feel
some
degree
of
gratification
at
having
been
instrumental
however
remotely
in
opening
to
the
eye
of
science
one
of
the
most
intensely
exciting
secrets
which
has
ever
engrossed
its
attention
january
18--this
morning
4
we
continued
to
the
southward
with
the
same
pleasant
weather
as
before
the
sea
was
entirely
smooth
the
air
tolerably
warm
and
from
the
northeast
the
temperature
of
the
water
fifty-three
we
now
again
got
our
sounding-gear
in
order
and
with
a
hundred
and
fifty
fathoms
of
line
found
the
current
setting
toward
the
pole
at
the
rate
of
a
mile
an
hour
this
constant
tendency
to
the
southward
both
in
the
wind
and
current
caused
some
degree
of
speculation
and
even
of
alarm
in
different
quarters
of
the
schooner
and
i
saw
distinctly
that
no
little
impression
had
been
made
upon
the
mind
of
captain
guy
he
was
exceedingly
sensitive
to
ridicule
however
and
i
finally
succeeded
in
laughing
him
out
of
his
apprehensions
the
variation
was
now
very
trivial
in
the
course
of
the
day
we
saw
several
large
whales
of
the
right
species
and
innumerable
flights
of
the
albatross
passed
over
the
vessel
we
also
picked
up
a
bush
full
of
red
berries
like
those
of
the
hawthorn
and
the
carcass
of
a
singular-looking
land-animal
it
was
three
feet
in
length
and
but
six
inches
in
height
with
four
very
short
legs
the
feet
armed
with
long
claws
of
a
brilliant
scarlet
and
resembling
coral
in
substance
the
body
was
covered
with
a
straight
silky
hair
perfectly
white
the
tail
was
peaked
like
that
of
a
rat
and
about
a
foot
and
a
half
long
the
head
resembled
a
catâ€™s
with
the
exception
of
the
ears--these
were
flopped
like
the
ears
of
a
dog
the
teeth
were
of
the
same
brilliant
scarlet
as
the
claws
january
19--to-day
being
in
latitude
83
degrees
20â€™
longitude
43
degrees
5â€™
w
the
sea
being
of
an
extraordinarily
dark
colour
we
again
saw
land
from
the
masthead
and
upon
a
closer
scrutiny
found
it
to
be
one
of
a
group
of
very
large
islands
the
shore
was
precipitous
and
the
interior
seemed
to
be
well
wooded
a
circumstance
which
occasioned
us
great
joy
in
about
four
hours
from
our
first
discovering
the
land
we
came
to
anchor
in
ten
fathoms
sandy
bottom
a
league
from
the
coast
as
a
high
surf
with
strong
ripples
here
and
there
rendered
a
nearer
approach
of
doubtful
expediency
the
two
largest
boats
were
now
ordered
out
and
a
party
well
armed
among
whom
were
peters
and
myself
proceeded
to
look
for
an
opening
in
the
reef
which
appeared
to
encircle
the
island
after
searching
about
for
some
time
we
discovered
an
inlet
which
we
were
entering
when
we
saw
four
large
canoes
put
off
from
the
shore
filled
with
men
who
seemed
to
be
well
armed
we
waited
for
them
to
come
up
and
as
they
moved
with
great
rapidity
they
were
soon
within
hail
captain
guy
now
held
up
a
white
handkerchief
on
the
blade
of
an
oar
when
the
strangers
made
a
full
stop
and
commenced
a
loud
jabbering
all
at
once
intermingled
with
occasional
shouts
in
which
we
could
distinguish
the
words
anamoo-moo
and
lama-lama
they
continued
this
for
at
least
half
an
hour
during
which
we
had
a
good
opportunity
of
observing
their
appearance
in
the
four
canoes
which
might
have
been
fifty
feet
long
and
five
broad
there
were
a
hundred
and
ten
savages
in
all
they
were
about
the
ordinary
stature
of
europeans
but
of
a
more
muscular
and
brawny
frame
their
complexion
a
jet
black
with
thick
and
long
woolly
hair
they
were
clothed
in
skins
of
an
unknown
black
animal
shaggy
and
silky
and
made
to
fit
the
body
with
some
degree
of
skill
the
hair
being
inside
except
where
turned
out
about
the
neck
wrists
and
ankles
their
arms
consisted
principally
of
clubs
of
a
dark
and
apparently
very
heavy
wood
some
spears
however
were
observed
among
them
headed
with
flint
and
a
few
slings
the
bottoms
of
the
canoes
were
full
of
black
stones
about
the
size
of
a
large
egg
when
they
had
concluded
their
harangue
for
it
was
clear
they
intended
their
jabbering
for
such
one
of
them
who
seemed
to
be
the
chief
stood
up
in
the
prow
of
his
canoe
and
made
signs
for
us
to
bring
our
boats
alongside
of
him
this
hint
we
pretended
not
to
understand
thinking
it
the
wiser
plan
to
maintain
if
possible
the
interval
between
us
as
their
number
more
than
quadrupled
our
own
finding
this
to
be
the
case
the
chief
ordered
the
three
other
canoes
to
hold
back
while
he
advanced
toward
us
with
his
own
as
soon
as
he
came
up
with
us
he
leaped
on
board
the
largest
of
our
boats
and
seated
himself
by
the
side
of
captain
guy
pointing
at
the
same
time
to
the
schooner
and
repeating
the
word
anamoo-moo
and
lama-lama
we
now
put
back
to
the
vessel
the
four
canoes
following
at
a
little
distance
upon
getting
alongside
the
chief
evinced
symptoms
of
extreme
surprise
and
delight
clapping
his
hands
slapping
his
thighs
and
breast
and
laughing
obstreperously
his
followers
behind
joined
in
his
merriment
and
for
some
minutes
the
din
was
so
excessive
as
to
be
absolutely
deafening
quiet
being
at
length
restored
captain
guy
ordered
the
boats
to
be
hoisted
up
as
a
necessary
precaution
and
gave
the
chief
whose
name
we
soon
found
to
be
too-wit
to
understand
that
we
could
admit
no
more
than
twenty
of
his
men
on
deck
at
one
time
with
this
arrangement
he
appeared
perfectly
satisfied
and
gave
some
directions
to
the
canoes
when
one
of
them
approached
the
rest
remaining
about
fifty
yards
off
twenty
of
the
savages
now
got
on
board
and
proceeded
to
ramble
over
every
part
of
the
deck
and
scramble
about
among
the
rigging
making
themselves
much
at
home
and
examining
every
article
with
great
inquisitiveness
it
was
quite
evident
that
they
had
never
before
seen
any
of
the
white
race--from
whose
complexion
indeed
they
appeared
to
recoil
they
believed
the
jane
to
be
a
living
creature
and
seemed
to
be
afraid
of
hurting
it
with
the
points
of
their
spears
carefully
turning
them
up
our
crew
were
much
amused
with
the
conduct
of
too-wit
in
one
instance
the
cook
was
splitting
some
wood
near
the
galley
and
by
accident
struck
his
axe
into
the
deck
making
a
gash
of
considerable
depth
the
chief
immediately
ran
up
and
pushing
the
cook
on
one
side
rather
roughly
commenced
a
half
whine
half
howl
strongly
indicative
of
sympathy
in
what
he
considered
the
sufferings
of
the
schooner
patting
and
smoothing
the
gash
with
his
hand
and
washing
it
from
a
bucket
of
seawater
which
stood
by
this
was
a
degree
of
ignorance
for
which
we
were
not
prepared
and
for
my
part
i
could
not
help
thinking
some
of
it
affected
when
the
visitors
had
satisfied
as
well
as
they
could
their
curiosity
in
regard
to
our
upper
works
they
were
admitted
below
when
their
amazement
exceeded
all
bounds
their
astonishment
now
appeared
to
be
far
too
deep
for
words
for
they
roamed
about
in
silence
broken
only
by
low
ejaculations
the
arms
afforded
them
much
food
for
speculation
and
they
were
suffered
to
handle
and
examine
them
at
leisure
i
do
not
believe
that
they
had
the
least
suspicion
of
their
actual
use
but
rather
took
them
for
idols
seeing
the
care
we
had
of
them
and
the
attention
with
which
we
watched
their
movements
while
handling
them
at
the
great
guns
their
wonder
was
redoubled
they
approached
them
with
every
mark
of
the
profoundest
reverence
and
awe
but
forbore
to
examine
them
minutely
there
were
two
large
mirrors
in
the
cabin
and
here
was
the
acme
of
their
amazement
too-wit
was
the
first
to
approach
them
and
he
had
got
in
the
middle
of
the
cabin
with
his
face
to
one
and
his
back
to
the
other
before
he
fairly
perceived
them
upon
raising
his
eyes
and
seeing
his
reflected
self
in
the
glass
i
thought
the
savage
would
go
mad
but
upon
turning
short
round
to
make
a
retreat
and
beholding
himself
a
second
time
in
the
opposite
direction
i
was
afraid
he
would
expire
upon
the
spot
no
persuasion
could
prevail
upon
him
to
take
another
look
throwing
himself
upon
the
floor
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
he
remained
thus
until
we
were
obliged
to
drag
him
upon
deck
the
whole
of
the
savages
were
admitted
on
board
in
this
manner
twenty
at
a
time
too-wit
being
suffered
to
remain
during
the
entire
period
we
saw
no
disposition
to
thievery
among
them
nor
did
we
miss
a
single
article
after
their
departure
throughout
the
whole
of
their
visit
they
evinced
the
most
friendly
manner
there
were
however
some
points
in
their
demeanour
which
we
found
it
impossible
to
understand
for
example
we
could
not
get
them
to
approach
several
very
harmless
objects--such
as
the
schoonerâ€™s
sails
an
egg
an
open
book
or
a
pan
of
flour
we
endeavoured
to
ascertain
if
they
had
among
them
any
articles
which
might
be
turned
to
account
in
the
way
of
traffic
but
found
great
difficulty
in
being
comprehended
we
made
out
nevertheless
what
greatly
astonished
us
that
the
islands
abounded
in
the
large
tortoise
of
the
gallipagos
one
of
which
we
saw
in
the
canoe
of
too-wit
we
saw
also
some
biche
de
mer
in
the
hands
of
one
of
the
savages
who
was
greedily
devouring
it
in
its
natural
state
these
anomalies--for
they
were
such
when
considered
in
regard
to
the
latitude--induced
captain
guy
to
wish
for
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
country
in
the
hope
of
making
a
profitable
speculation
in
his
discovery
for
my
own
part
anxious
as
i
was
to
know
something
more
of
these
islands
i
was
still
more
earnestly
bent
on
prosecuting
the
voyage
to
the
southward
without
delay
we
had
now
fine
weather
but
there
was
no
telling
how
long
it
would
last
and
being
already
in
the
eighty-fourth
parallel
with
an
open
sea
before
us
a
current
setting
strongly
to
the
southward
and
the
wind
fair
i
could
not
listen
with
any
patience
to
a
proposition
of
stopping
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
for
the
health
of
the
crew
and
the
taking
on
board
a
proper
supply
of
fuel
and
fresh
provisions
i
represented
to
the
captain
that
we
might
easily
make
this
group
on
our
return
and
winter
here
in
the
event
of
being
blocked
up
by
the
ice
he
at
length
came
into
my
views
for
in
some
way
hardly
known
to
myself
i
had
acquired
much
influence
over
him
and
it
was
finally
resolved
that
even
in
the
event
of
our
finding
biche
de
mer
we
should
only
stay
here
a
week
to
recruit
and
then
push
on
to
the
southward
while
we
might
accordingly
we
made
every
necessary
preparation
and
under
the
guidance
of
too-wit
got
the
jane
through
the
reef
in
safety
coming
to
anchor
about
a
mile
from
the
shore
in
an
excellent
bay
completely
landlocked
on
the
southeastern
coast
of
the
main
island
and
in
ten
fathoms
of
water
black
sandy
bottom
at
the
head
of
this
bay
there
were
three
fine
springs
we
were
told
of
good
water
and
we
saw
abundance
of
wood
in
the
vicinity
the
four
canoes
followed
us
in
keeping
however
at
a
respectful
distance
too-wit
himself
remained
on
board
and
upon
our
dropping
anchor
invited
us
to
accompany
him
on
shore
and
visit
his
village
in
the
interior
to
this
captain
guy
consented
and
ten
savages
being
left
on
board
as
hostages
a
party
of
us
twelve
in
all
got
in
readiness
to
attend
the
chief
we
took
care
to
be
well
armed
yet
without
evincing
any
distrust
the
schooner
had
her
guns
run
out
her
boarding-nettings
up
and
every
other
proper
precaution
was
taken
to
guard
against
surprise
directions
were
left
with
the
chief
mate
to
admit
no
person
on
board
during
our
absence
and
in
the
event
of
our
not
appearing
in
twelve
hours
to
send
the
cutter
with
a
swivel
around
the
island
in
search
of
us
at
every
step
we
took
inland
the
conviction
forced
itself
upon
us
that
we
were
in
a
country
differing
essentially
from
any
hitherto
visited
by
civilized
men
we
saw
nothing
with
which
we
had
been
formerly
conversant
the
trees
resembled
no
growth
of
either
the
torrid
the
temperate
or
the
northern
frigid
zones
and
were
altogether
unlike
those
of
the
lower
southern
latitudes
we
had
already
traversed
the
very
rocks
were
novel
in
their
mass
their
color
and
their
stratification
and
the
streams
themselves
utterly
incredible
as
it
may
appear
had
so
little
in
common
with
those
of
other
climates
that
we
were
scrupulous
of
tasting
them
and
indeed
had
difficulty
in
bringing
ourselves
to
believe
that
their
qualities
were
purely
those
of
nature
at
a
small
brook
which
crossed
our
path
the
first
we
had
reached
too-wit
and
his
attendants
halted
to
drink
on
account
of
the
singular
character
of
the
water
we
refused
to
taste
it
supposing
it
to
be
polluted
and
it
was
not
until
some
time
afterward
we
came
to
understand
that
such
was
the
appearance
of
the
streams
throughout
the
whole
group
i
am
at
a
loss
to
give
a
distinct
idea
of
the
nature
of
this
liquid
and
cannot
do
so
without
many
words
although
it
flowed
with
rapidity
in
all
declivities
where
common
water
would
do
so
yet
never
except
when
falling
in
a
cascade
had
it
the
customary
appearance
of
limpidity
it
was
nevertheless
in
point
of
fact
as
perfectly
limpid
as
any
limestone
water
in
existence
the
difference
being
only
in
appearance
at
first
sight
and
especially
in
cases
where
little
declivity
was
found
it
bore
resemblance
as
regards
consistency
to
a
thick
infusion
of
gum
arabic
in
common
water
but
this
was
only
the
least
remarkable
of
its
extraordinary
qualities
it
was
not
colourless
nor
was
it
of
any
one
uniform
colour--presenting
to
the
eye
as
it
flowed
every
possible
shade
of
purple
like
the
hues
of
a
changeable
silk
this
variation
in
shade
was
produced
in
a
manner
which
excited
as
profound
astonishment
in
the
minds
of
our
party
as
the
mirror
had
done
in
the
case
of
too-wit
upon
collecting
a
basinful
and
allowing
it
to
settle
thoroughly
we
perceived
that
the
whole
mass
of
liquid
was
made
up
of
a
number
of
distinct
veins
each
of
a
distinct
hue
that
these
veins
did
not
commingle
and
that
their
cohesion
was
perfect
in
regard
to
their
own
particles
among
themselves
and
imperfect
in
regard
to
neighbouring
veins
upon
passing
the
blade
of
a
knife
athwart
the
veins
the
water
closed
over
it
immediately
as
with
us
and
also
in
withdrawing
it
all
traces
of
the
passage
of
the
knife
were
instantly
obliterated
if
however
the
blade
was
passed
down
accurately
between
the
two
veins
a
perfect
separation
was
effected
which
the
power
of
cohesion
did
not
immediately
rectify
the
phenomena
of
this
water
formed
the
first
definite
link
in
that
vast
chain
of
apparent
miracles
with
which
i
was
destined
to
be
at
length
encircled
we
were
nearly
three
hours
in
reaching
the
village
it
being
more
than
nine
miles
in
the
interior
and
the
path
lying
through
a
rugged
country
as
we
passed
along
the
party
of
too-wit
the
whole
hundred
and
ten
savages
of
the
canoes
was
momentarily
strengthened
by
smaller
detachments
of
from
two
to
six
or
seven
which
joined
us
as
if
by
accident
at
different
turns
of
the
road
there
appeared
so
much
of
system
in
this
that
i
could
not
help
feeling
distrust
and
i
spoke
to
captain
guy
of
my
apprehensions
it
was
now
too
late
however
to
recede
and
we
concluded
that
our
best
security
lay
in
evincing
a
perfect
confidence
in
the
good
faith
of
too-wit
we
accordingly
went
on
keeping
a
wary
eye
upon
the
manoeuvres
of
the
savages
and
not
permitting
them
to
divide
our
numbers
by
pushing
in
between
in
this
way
passing
through
a
precipitous
ravine
we
at
length
reached
what
we
were
told
was
the
only
collection
of
habitations
upon
the
island
as
we
came
in
sight
of
them
the
chief
set
up
a
shout
and
frequently
repeated
the
word
klock-klock
which
we
supposed
to
be
the
name
of
the
village
or
perhaps
the
generic
name
for
villages
the
dwellings
were
of
the
most
miserable
description
imaginable
and
unlike
those
of
even
the
lowest
of
the
savage
races
with
which
mankind
are
acquainted
were
of
no
uniform
plan
some
of
them
and
these
we
found
belonged
to
the
wampoos
or
yampoos
the
great
men
of
the
land
consisted
of
a
tree
cut
down
at
about
four
feet
from
the
root
with
a
large
black
skin
thrown
over
it
and
hanging
in
loose
folds
upon
the
ground
under
this
the
savage
nestled
others
were
formed
by
means
of
rough
limbs
of
trees
with
the
withered
foliage
upon
them
made
to
recline
at
an
angle
of
forty-five
degrees
against
a
bank
of
clay
heaped
up
without
regular
form
to
the
height
of
five
or
six
feet
others
again
were
mere
holes
dug
in
the
earth
perpendicularly
and
covered
over
with
similar
branches
these
being
removed
when
the
tenant
was
about
to
enter
and
pulled
on
again
when
he
had
entered
a
few
were
built
among
the
forked
limbs
of
trees
as
they
stood
the
upper
limbs
being
partially
cut
through
so
as
to
bend
over
upon
the
lower
thus
forming
thicker
shelter
from
the
weather
the
greater
number
however
consisted
of
small
shallow
caverns
apparently
scratched
in
the
face
of
a
precipitous
ledge
of
dark
stone
resembling
fullerâ€™s
earth
with
which
three
sides
of
the
village
were
bounded
at
the
door
of
each
of
these
primitive
caverns
was
a
small
rock
which
the
tenant
carefully
placed
before
the
entrance
upon
leaving
his
residence
for
what
purpose
i
could
not
ascertain
as
the
stone
itself
was
never
of
sufficient
size
to
close
up
more
than
a
third
of
the
opening
this
village
if
it
were
worthy
of
the
name
lay
in
a
valley
of
some
depth
and
could
only
be
approached
from
the
southward
the
precipitous
ledge
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
cutting
off
all
access
in
other
directions
through
the
middle
of
the
valley
ran
a
brawling
stream
of
the
same
magical-looking
water
which
has
been
described
we
saw
several
strange
animals
about
the
dwellings
all
appearing
to
be
thoroughly
domesticated
the
largest
of
these
creatures
resembled
our
common
hog
in
the
structure
of
the
body
and
snout
the
tail
however
was
bushy
and
the
legs
slender
as
those
of
the
antelope
its
motion
was
exceedingly
awkward
and
indecisive
and
we
never
saw
it
attempt
to
run
we
noticed
also
several
animals
very
similar
in
appearance
but
of
a
greater
length
of
body
and
covered
with
a
black
wool
there
were
a
great
variety
of
tame
fowls
running
about
and
these
seemed
to
constitute
the
chief
food
of
the
natives
to
our
astonishment
we
saw
black
albatross
among
these
birds
in
a
state
of
entire
domestication
going
to
sea
periodically
for
food
but
always
returning
to
the
village
as
a
home
and
using
the
southern
shore
in
the
vicinity
as
a
place
of
incubation
there
they
were
joined
by
their
friends
the
pelicans
as
usual
but
these
latter
never
followed
them
to
the
dwellings
of
the
savages
among
the
other
kinds
of
tame
fowls
were
ducks
differing
very
little
from
the
canvass-back
of
our
own
country
black
gannets
and
a
large
bird
not
unlike
the
buzzard
in
appearance
but
not
carnivorous
of
fish
there
seemed
to
be
a
great
abundance
we
saw
during
our
visit
a
quantity
of
dried
salmon
rock
cod
blue
dolphins
mackerel
blackfish
skate
conger
eels
elephantfish
mullets
soles
parrotfish
leather-jackets
gurnards
hake
flounders
paracutas
and
innumerable
other
varieties
we
noticed
too
that
most
of
them
were
similar
to
the
fish
about
the
group
of
lord
auckland
islands
in
a
latitude
as
low
as
fifty-one
degrees
south
the
gallipago
tortoise
was
also
very
plentiful
we
saw
but
few
wild
animals
and
none
of
a
large
size
or
of
a
species
with
which
we
were
familiar
one
or
two
serpents
of
a
formidable
aspect
crossed
our
path
but
the
natives
paid
them
little
attention
and
we
concluded
that
they
were
not
venomous
as
we
approached
the
village
with
too-wit
and
his
party
a
vast
crowd
of
the
people
rushed
out
to
meet
us
with
loud
shouts
among
which
we
could
only
distinguish
the
everlasting
anamoo-moo
and
lama-lama
we
were
much
surprised
at
perceiving
that
with
one
or
two
exceptions
these
new
comers
were
entirely
naked
and
skins
being
used
only
by
the
men
of
the
canoes
all
the
weapons
of
the
country
seemed
also
to
be
in
the
possession
of
the
latter
for
there
was
no
appearance
of
any
among
the
villagers
there
were
a
great
many
women
and
children
the
former
not
altogether
wanting
in
what
might
be
termed
personal
beauty
they
were
straight
tall
and
well
formed
with
a
grace
and
freedom
of
carriage
not
to
be
found
in
civilized
society
their
lips
however
like
those
of
the
men
were
thick
and
clumsy
so
that
even
when
laughing
the
teeth
were
never
disclosed
their
hair
was
of
a
finer
texture
than
that
of
the
males
among
these
naked
villagers
there
might
have
been
ten
or
twelve
who
were
clothed
like
the
party
of
too-wit
in
dresses
of
black
skin
and
armed
with
lances
and
heavy
clubs
these
appeared
to
have
great
influence
among
the
rest
and
were
always
addressed
by
the
title
wampoo
these
too
were
the
tenants
of
the
black
skin
palaces
that
of
too-wit
was
situated
in
the
centre
of
the
village
and
was
much
larger
and
somewhat
better
constructed
than
others
of
its
kind
the
tree
which
formed
its
support
was
cut
off
at
a
distance
of
twelve
feet
or
thereabouts
from
the
root
and
there
were
several
branches
left
just
below
the
cut
these
serving
to
extend
the
covering
and
in
this
way
prevent
its
flapping
about
the
trunk
the
covering
too
which
consisted
of
four
very
large
skins
fastened
together
with
wooden
skewers
was
secured
at
the
bottom
with
pegs
driven
through
it
and
into
the
ground
the
floor
was
strewed
with
a
quantity
of
dry
leaves
by
way
of
carpet
to
this
hut
we
were
conducted
with
great
solemnity
and
as
many
of
the
natives
crowded
in
after
us
as
possible
too-wit
seated
himself
on
the
leaves
and
made
signs
that
we
should
follow
his
example
this
we
did
and
presently
found
ourselves
in
a
situation
peculiarly
uncomfortable
if
not
indeed
critical
we
were
on
the
ground
twelve
in
number
with
the
savages
as
many
as
forty
sitting
on
their
hams
so
closely
around
us
that
if
any
disturbance
had
arisen
we
should
have
found
it
impossible
to
make
use
of
our
arms
or
indeed
to
have
risen
to
our
feet
the
pressure
was
not
only
inside
the
tent
but
outside
where
probably
was
every
individual
on
the
whole
island
the
crowd
being
prevented
from
trampling
us
to
death
only
by
the
incessant
exertions
and
vociferations
of
too-wit
our
chief
security
lay
however
in
the
presence
of
too-wit
himself
among
us
and
we
resolved
to
stick
by
him
closely
as
the
best
chance
of
extricating
ourselves
from
the
dilemma
sacrificing
him
immediately
upon
the
first
appearance
of
hostile
design
after
some
trouble
a
certain
degree
of
quiet
was
restored
when
the
chief
addressed
us
in
a
speech
of
great
length
and
very
nearly
resembling
the
one
delivered
in
the
canoes
with
the
exception
that
the
anamoo-moos
were
now
somewhat
more
strenuously
insisted
upon
than
the
lama-lamas
we
listened
in
profound
silence
until
the
conclusion
of
this
harangue
when
captain
guy
replied
by
assuring
the
chief
of
his
eternal
friendship
and
goodwill
concluding
what
he
had
to
say
by
a
present
of
several
strings
of
blue
beads
and
a
knife
at
the
former
the
monarch
much
to
our
surprise
turned
up
his
nose
with
some
expression
of
contempt
but
the
knife
gave
him
the
most
unlimited
satisfaction
and
he
immediately
ordered
dinner
this
was
handed
into
the
tent
over
the
heads
of
the
attendants
and
consisted
of
the
palpitating
entrails
of
a
specialis
of
unknown
animal
probably
one
of
the
slim-legged
hogs
which
we
had
observed
in
our
approach
to
the
village
seeing
us
at
a
loss
how
to
proceed
he
began
by
way
of
setting
us
an
example
to
devour
yard
after
yard
of
the
enticing
food
until
we
could
positively
stand
it
no
longer
and
evinced
such
manifest
symptoms
of
rebellion
of
stomach
as
inspired
his
majesty
with
a
degree
of
astonishment
only
inferior
to
that
brought
about
by
the
looking-glasses
we
declined
however
partaking
of
the
delicacies
before
us
and
endeavoured
to
make
him
understand
that
we
had
no
appetite
whatever
having
just
finished
a
hearty
dejeuner
when
the
monarch
had
made
an
end
of
his
meal
we
commenced
a
series
of
cross-questioning
in
every
ingenious
manner
we
could
devise
with
a
view
of
discovering
what
were
the
chief
productions
of
the
country
and
whether
any
of
them
might
be
turned
to
profit
at
length
he
seemed
to
have
some
idea
of
our
meaning
and
offered
to
accompany
us
to
a
part
of
coast
where
he
assured
us
the
biche
de
mer
pointing
to
a
specimen
of
that
animal
was
to
be
found
in
great
abundance
we
were
glad
of
this
early
opportunity
of
escaping
from
the
oppression
of
the
crowd
and
signified
our
eagerness
to
proceed
we
now
left
the
tent
and
accompanied
by
the
whole
population
of
the
village
followed
the
chief
to
the
southeastern
extremity
of
the
island
nor
far
from
the
bay
where
our
vessel
lay
at
anchor
we
waited
here
for
about
an
hour
until
the
four
canoes
were
brought
around
by
some
of
the
savages
to
our
station
the
whole
of
our
party
then
getting
into
one
of
them
we
were
paddled
along
the
edge
of
the
reef
before
mentioned
and
of
another
still
farther
out
where
we
saw
a
far
greater
quantity
of
biche
de
mer
than
the
oldest
seamen
among
us
had
ever
seen
in
those
groups
of
the
lower
latitudes
most
celebrated
for
this
article
of
commerce
we
stayed
near
these
reefs
only
long
enough
to
satisfy
ourselves
that
we
could
easily
load
a
dozen
vessels
with
the
animal
if
necessary
when
we
were
taken
alongside
the
schooner
and
parted
with
too-wit
after
obtaining
from
him
a
promise
that
he
would
bring
us
in
the
course
of
twenty-four
hours
as
many
of
the
canvass-back
ducks
and
gallipago
tortoises
as
his
canoes
would
hold
in
the
whole
of
this
adventure
we
saw
nothing
in
the
demeanour
of
the
natives
calculated
to
create
suspicion
with
the
single
exception
of
the
systematic
manner
in
which
their
party
was
strengthened
during
our
route
from
the
schooner
to
the
village
the
chief
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
we
were
soon
plentifully
supplied
with
fresh
provisions
we
found
the
tortoises
as
fine
as
we
had
ever
seen
and
the
ducks
surpassed
our
best
species
of
wild
fowl
being
exceedingly
tender
juicy
and
well-flavoured
besides
these
the
savages
brought
us
upon
our
making
them
comprehend
our
wishes
a
vast
quantity
of
brown
celery
and
scurvy
grass
with
a
canoe-load
of
fresh
fish
and
some
dried
the
celery
was
a
treat
indeed
and
the
scurvy
grass
proved
of
incalculable
benefit
in
restoring
those
of
our
men
who
had
shown
symptoms
of
disease
in
a
very
short
time
we
had
not
a
single
person
on
the
sick-list
we
had
also
plenty
of
other
kinds
of
fresh
provisions
among
which
may
be
mentioned
a
species
of
shellfish
resembling
the
mussel
in
shape
but
with
the
taste
of
an
oyster
shrimps
too
and
prawns
were
abundant
and
albatross
and
other
birdsâ€™
eggs
with
dark
shells
we
took
in
too
a
plentiful
stock
of
the
flesh
of
the
hog
which
i
have
mentioned
before
most
of
the
men
found
it
a
palatable
food
but
i
thought
it
fishy
and
otherwise
disagreeable
in
return
for
these
good
things
we
presented
the
natives
with
blue
beads
brass
trinkets
nails
knives
and
pieces
of
red
cloth
they
being
fully
delighted
in
the
exchange
we
established
a
regular
market
on
shore
just
under
the
guns
of
the
schooner
where
our
barterings
were
carried
on
with
every
appearance
of
good
faith
and
a
degree
of
order
which
their
conduct
at
the
village
of
klock-klock
had
not
led
us
to
expect
from
the
savages
matters
went
on
thus
very
amicably
for
several
days
during
which
parties
of
the
natives
were
frequently
on
board
the
schooner
and
parties
of
our
men
frequently
on
shore
making
long
excursions
into
the
interior
and
receiving
no
molestation
whatever
finding
the
ease
with
which
the
vessel
might
be
loaded
with
biche
de
mer
owing
to
the
friendly
disposition
of
the
islanders
and
the
readiness
with
which
they
would
render
us
assistance
in
collecting
it
captain
guy
resolved
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
too-wit
for
the
erection
of
suitable
houses
in
which
to
cure
the
article
and
for
the
services
of
himself
and
tribe
in
gathering
as
much
as
possible
while
he
himself
took
advantage
of
the
fine
weather
to
prosecute
his
voyage
to
the
southward
upon
mentioning
this
project
to
the
chief
he
seemed
very
willing
to
enter
into
an
agreement
a
bargain
was
accordingly
struck
perfectly
satisfactory
to
both
parties
by
which
it
was
arranged
that
after
making
the
necessary
preparations
such
as
laying
off
the
proper
grounds
erecting
a
portion
of
the
buildings
and
doing
some
other
work
in
which
the
whole
of
our
crew
would
be
required
the
schooner
should
proceed
on
her
route
leaving
three
of
her
men
on
the
island
to
superintend
the
fulfilment
of
the
project
and
instruct
the
natives
in
drying
the
biche
de
mer
in
regard
to
terms
these
were
made
to
depend
upon
the
exertions
of
the
savages
in
our
absence
they
were
to
receive
a
stipulated
quantity
of
blue
beads
knives
red
cloth
and
so
forth
for
every
certain
number
of
piculs
of
the
biche
de
mer
which
should
be
ready
on
our
return
a
description
of
the
nature
of
this
important
article
of
commerce
and
the
method
of
preparing
it
may
prove
of
some
interest
to
my
readers
and
i
can
find
no
more
suitable
place
than
this
for
introducing
an
account
of
it
the
following
comprehensive
notice
of
the
substance
is
taken
from
a
modern
history
of
a
voyage
to
the
south
seas
â€œit
is
that
mollusca
from
the
indian
seas
which
is
known
to
commerce
by
the
french
name
bouche
de
mer
a
nice
morsel
from
the
sea
if
i
am
not
much
mistaken
the
celebrated
cuvier
calls
it
gasteropeda
pulmonifera
it
is
abundantly
gathered
in
the
coasts
of
the
pacific
islands
and
gathered
especially
for
the
chinese
market
where
it
commands
a
great
price
perhaps
as
much
as
their
much-talked-of
edible
birdsâ€™
nests
which
are
properly
made
up
of
the
gelatinous
matter
picked
up
by
a
species
of
swallow
from
the
body
of
these
molluscae
they
have
no
shell
no
legs
nor
any
prominent
part
except
an
absorbing
and
an
excretory
opposite
organs
but
by
their
elastic
wings
like
caterpillars
or
worms
they
creep
in
shallow
waters
in
which
when
low
they
can
be
seen
by
a
kind
of
swallow
the
sharp
bill
of
which
inserted
in
the
soft
animal
draws
a
gummy
and
filamentous
substance
which
by
drying
can
be
wrought
into
the
solid
walls
of
their
nest
hence
the
name
of
gasteropeda
pulmonifera
â€œthis
mollusca
is
oblong
and
of
different
sizes
from
three
to
eighteen
inches
in
length
and
i
have
seen
a
few
that
were
not
less
than
two
feet
long
they
were
nearly
round
a
little
flattish
on
one
side
which
lies
next
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
they
are
from
one
to
eight
inches
thick
they
crawl
up
into
shallow
water
at
particular
seasons
of
the
year
probably
for
the
purpose
of
gendering
as
we
often
find
them
in
pairs
it
is
when
the
sun
has
the
most
power
on
the
water
rendering
it
tepid
that
they
approach
the
shore
and
they
often
go
up
into
places
so
shallow
that
on
the
tideâ€™s
receding
they
are
left
dry
exposed
to
the
beat
of
the
sun
but
they
do
not
bring
forth
their
young
in
shallow
water
as
we
never
see
any
of
their
progeny
and
full-grown
ones
are
always
observed
coming
in
from
deep
water
they
feed
principally
on
that
class
of
zoophytes
which
produce

coral
â€œthe
biche

generally
taken
in
three
or
four

of

which
they
are
brought
on

and
split
at
one
end

a
knife

more

to
the
size

then
washed
and
afterward
boiled
to
a
certain
degree

must
not
be
too
much

little

buried
in
the

four
hours
then
boiled
again
for
a
short
time
after
which
they
are

an
agreement
having
been
thus
entered
into
we
proceeded
immediately
to
land
everything
necessary
for
preparing
the
buildings
and
clearing
the
ground
a
large
flat
space
near
the
eastern
shore
of
the
bay
was
selected
where
there
was
plenty
of
both
wood
and
water
and
within
a
convenient
distance
of
the
principal
reefs
on
which
the
biche
de
mer
was
to
be
procured
we
now
all
set
to
work
in
good
earnest
and
soon
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
savages
had
felled
a
sufficient
number
of
trees
for
our
purpose
getting
them
quickly
in
order
for
the
framework
of
the
houses
which
in
two
or
three
days
were
so
far
under
way
that
we
could
safely
trust
the
rest
of
the
work
to
the
three
men
whom
we
intended
to
leave
behind
these
were
john
carson
alfred
harris
and

peterson
all
natives
of
london
i
believe
who
volunteered
their
services
in
this
respect
by
the
last
of
the
month
we
had
everything
in
readiness
for
departure
we
had
agreed
however
to
pay
a
formal
visit
of
leave-taking
to
the
village
and
too-wit
insisted
so
pertinaciously
upon
our
keeping
the
promise
that
we
did
not
think
it
advisable
to
run
the
risk
of
offending
him
by
a
final
refusal
i
believe
that
not
one
of
us
had
at
this
time
the
slightest
suspicion
of
the
good
faith
of
the
savages
they
had
uniformly
behaved
with
the
greatest
decorum
aiding
us
with
alacrity
in
our
work
offering
us
their
commodities
frequently
without
price
and
never
in
any
instance
pilfering
a
single
article
although
the
high
value
they
set
upon
the
goods
we
had
with
us
was
evident
by
the
extravagant
demonstrations
of
joy
always
manifested
upon
our
making
them
a
present
the
women
especially
were
most
obliging
in
every
respect
and
upon
the
whole
we
should
have
been
the
most
suspicious
of
human
beings
had
we
entertained
a
single
thought
of
perfidy
on
the
part
of
a
people
who
treated
us
so
well
a
very
short
while
sufficed
to
prove
that
this
apparent
kindness
of
disposition
was
only
the
result
of
a
deeply
laid
plan
for
our
destruction
and
that
the
islanders
for
whom
we
entertained
such
inordinate
feelings
of
esteem
were
among
the
most
barbarous
subtle
and
bloodthirsty
wretches
that
ever
contaminated
the
face
of
the
globe
it
was
on
the
first
of
february
that
we
went
on
shore
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
the
village
although
as
said
before
we
entertained
not
the
slightest
suspicion
still
no
proper
precaution
was
neglected
six
men
were
left
in
the
schooner
with
instructions
to
permit
none
of
the
savages
to
approach
the
vessel
during
our
absence
under
any
pretence
whatever
and
to
remain
constantly
on
deck
the
boarding-nettings
were
up
the
guns
double-shotted
with
grape
and
canister
and
the
swivels
loaded
with
canisters
of
musket-balls
she
lay
with
her
anchor
apeak
about
a
mile
from
the
shore
and
no
canoe
could
approach
her
in
any
direction
without
being
distinctly
seen
and
exposed
to
the
full
fire
of
our
swivels
immediately
the
six
men
being
left
on
board
our
shore-party
consisted
of
thirty-two
persons
in
all
we
were
armed
to
the
teeth
having
with
us
muskets
pistols
and
cutlasses
besides
each
had
a
long
kind
of
seamanâ€™s
knife
somewhat
resembling
the
bowie
knife
now
so
much
used
throughout
our
western
and
southern
country
a
hundred
of
the
black
skin
warriors
met
us
at
the
landing
for
the
purpose
of
accompanying
us
on
our
way
we
noticed
however
with
some
surprise
that
they
were
now
entirely
without
arms
and
upon
questioning
too-wit
in
relation
to
this
circumstance
he
merely
answered
that
mattee
non
we
pa
pa
si--meaning
that
there
was
no
need
of
arms
where
all
were
brothers
we
took
this
in
good
part
and
proceeded
we
had
passed
the
spring
and
rivulet
of
which
i
before
spoke
and
were
now
entering
upon
a
narrow
gorge
leading
through
the
chain
of
soapstone
hills
among
which
the
village
was
situated
this
gorge
was
very
rocky
and
uneven
so
much
so
that
it
was
with
no
little
difficulty
we
scrambled
through
it
on
our
first
visit
to
klock-klock
the
whole
length
of
the
ravine
might
have
been
a
mile
and
a
half
or
probably
two
miles
it
wound
in
every
possible
direction
through
the
hills
having
apparently
formed
at
some
remote
period
the
bed
of
a
torrent
in
no
instance
proceeding
more
than
twenty
yards
without
an
abrupt
turn
the
sides
of
this
dell
would
have
averaged
i
am
sure
seventy
or
eighty
feet
in
perpendicular
altitude
throughout
the
whole
of
their
extent
and
in
some
portions
they
arose
to
an
astonishing
height
overshadowing
the
pass
so
completely
that
but
little
of
the
light
of
day
could
penetrate
the
general
width
was
about
forty
feet
and
occasionally
it
diminished
so
as
not
to
allow
the
passage
of
more
than
five
or
six
persons
abreast
in
short
there
could
be
no
place
in
the
world
better
adapted
for
the
consummation
of
an
ambuscade
and
it
was
no
more
than
natural
that
we
should
look
carefully
to
our
arms
as
we
entered
upon
it
when
i
now
think
of
our
egregious
folly
the
chief
subject
of
astonishment
seems
to
be
that
we
should
have
ever
ventured
under
any
circumstances
so
completely
into
the
power
of
unknown
savages
as
to
permit
them
to
march
both
before
and
behind
us
in
our
progress
through
this
ravine
yet
such
was
the
order
we
blindly
took
up
trusting
foolishly
to
the
force
of
our
party
the
unarmed
condition
of
too-wit
and
his
men
the
certain
efficacy
of
our
firearms
whose
effect
was
yet
a
secret
to
the
natives
and
more
than
all
to
the
long-sustained
pretension
of
friendship
kept
up
by
these
infamous
wretches
five
or
six
of
them
went
on
before
as
if
to
lead
the
way
ostentatiously
busying
themselves
in
removing
the
larger
stones
and
rubbish
from
the
path
next
came
our
own
party
we
walked
closely
together
taking
care
only
to
prevent
separation
behind
followed
the
main
body
of
the
savages
observing
unusual
order
and
decorum
dirk
peters
a
man
named
wilson
allen
and
myself
were
on
the
right
of
our
companions
examining
as
we
went
along
the
singular
stratification
of
the
precipice
which
overhung
us
a
fissure
in
the
soft
rock
attracted
our
attention
it
was
about
wide
enough
for
one
person
to
enter
without
squeezing
and
extended
back
into
the
hill
some
eighteen
or
twenty
feet
in
a
straight
course
sloping
afterward
to
the
left
the
height
of
the
opening
is
far
as
we
could
see
into
it
from
the
main
gorge
was
perhaps
sixty
or
seventy
feet
there
were
one
or
two
stunted
shrubs
growing
from
the
crevices
bearing
a
species
of
filbert
which
i
felt
some
curiosity
to
examine
and
pushed
in
briskly
for
that
purpose
gathering
five
or
six
of
the
nuts
at
a
grasp
and
then
hastily
retreating
as
i
turned
i
found
that
peters
and
allen
had
followed
me
i
desired
them
to
go
back
as
there
was
not
room
for
two
persons
to
pass
saying
they
should
have
some
of
my
nuts
they
accordingly
turned
and
were
scrambling
back
allen
being
close
to
the
mouth
of
the
fissure
when
i
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
concussion
resembling
nothing
i
had
ever
before
experienced
and
which
impressed
me
with
a
vague
conception
if
indeed
i
then
thought
of
anything
that
the
whole
foundations
of
the
solid
globe
were
suddenly
rent
asunder
and
that
the
day
of
universal
dissolution
was
at
hand
as
soon
as
i
could
collect
my
scattered
senses
i
found
myself
nearly
suffocated
and
grovelling
in
utter
darkness
among
a
quantity
of
loose
earth
which
was
also
falling
upon
me
heavily
in
every
direction
threatening
to
bury
me
entirely
horribly
alarmed
at
this
idea
i
struggled
to
gain
my
feet
and
at
last
succeeded
i
then
remained
motionless
for
some
moments
endeavouring
to
conceive
what
had
happened
to
me
and
where
i
was
presently
i
heard
a
deep
groan
just
at
my
ear
and
afterward
the
smothered
voice
of
peters
calling
to
me
for
aid
in
the
name
of
god
i
scrambled
one
or
two
paces
forward
when
i
fell
directly
over
the
head
and
shoulders
of
my
companion
who
i
soon
discovered
was
buried
in
a
loose
mass
of
earth
as
far
as
his
middle
and
struggling
desperately
to
free
himself
from
the
pressure
i
tore
the
dirt
from
around
him
with
all
the
energy
i
could
command
and
at
length
succeeded
in
getting
him
out
as
soon
as
we
sufficiently
recovered
from
our
fright
and
surprise
to
be
capable
of
conversing
rationally
we
both
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
walls
of
the
fissure
in
which
we
had
ventured
had
by
some
convulsion
of
nature
or
probably
from
their
own
weight
caved
in
overhead
and
that
we
were
consequently
lost
for
ever
being
thus
entombed
alive
for
a
long
time
we
gave
up
supinely
to
the
most
intense
agony
and
despair
such
as
cannot
be
adequately
imagined
by
those
who
have
never
been
in
a
similar
position
i
firmly
believed
that
no
incident
ever
occurring
in
the
course
of
human
events
is
more
adapted
to
inspire
the
supremeness
of
mental
and
bodily
distress
than
a
case
like
our
own
of
living
inhumation
the
blackness
of
darkness
which
envelops
the
victim
the
terrific
oppression
of
lungs
the
stifling
fumes
from
the
damp
earth
unite
with
the
ghastly
considerations
that
we
are
beyond
the
remotest
confines
of
hope
and
that
such
is
the
allotted
portion
of
the
dead
to
carry
into
the
human
heart
a
degree
of
appalling
awe
and
horror
not
to
be
tolerated--never
to
be
conceived
at
length
peters
proposed
that
we
should
endeavour
to
ascertain
precisely
the
extent
of
our
calamity
and
grope
about
our
prison
it
being
barely
possible
he
observed
that
some
opening
might
yet
be
left
us
for
escape
i
caught
eagerly
at
this
hope
and
arousing
myself
to
exertion
attempted
to
force
my
way
through
the
loose
earth
hardly
had
i
advanced
a
single
step
before
a
glimmer
of
light
became
perceptible
enough
to
convince
me
that
at
all
events
we
should
not
immediately
perish
for
want
of
air
we
now
took
some
degree
of
heart
and
encouraged
each
other
to
hope
for
the
best
having
scrambled
over
a
bank
of
rubbish
which
impeded
our
farther
progress
in
the
direction
of
the
light
we
found
less
difficulty
in
advancing
and
also
experienced
some
relief
from
the
excessive
oppression
of
lungs
which
had
tormented
us
presently
we
were
enabled
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
objects
around
and
discovered
that
we
were
near
the
extremity
of
the
straight
portion
of
the
fissure
where
it
made
a
turn
to
the
left
a
few
struggles
more
and
we
reached
the
bend
when
to
our
inexpressible
joy
there
appeared
a
long
seam
or
crack
extending
upward
a
vast
distance
generally
at
an
angle
of
about
forty-five
degrees
although
sometimes
much
more
precipitous
we
could
not
see
through
the
whole
extent
of
this
opening
but
as
a
good
deal
of
light
came
down
it
we
had
little
doubt
of
finding
at
the
top
of
it
if
we
could
by
any
means
reach
the
top
a
clear
passage
into
the
open
air
i
now
called
to
mind
that
three
of
us
had
entered
the
fissure
from
the
main
gorge
and
that
our
companion
allen
was
still
missing
we
determined
at
once
to
retrace
our
steps
and
look
for
him
after
a
long
search
and
much
danger
from
the
farther
caving
in
of
the
earth
above
us
peters
at
length
cried
out
to
me
that
he
had
hold
of
our
companionâ€™s
foot
and
that
his
whole
body
was
deeply
buried
beneath
the
rubbish
beyond
the
possibility
of
extricating
him
i
soon
found
that
what
he
said
was
too
true
and
that
of
course
life
had
been
long
extinct
with
sorrowful
hearts
therefore
we
left
the
corpse
to
its
fate
and
again
made
our
way
to
the
bend
the
breadth
of
the
seam
was
barely
sufficient
to
admit
us
and
after
one
or
two
ineffectual
efforts
at
getting
up
we
began
once
more
to
despair
i
have
before
said
that
the
chain
of
hills
through
which
ran
the
main
gorge
was
composed
of
a
species
of
soft
rock
resembling
soapstone
the
sides
of
the
cleft
we
were
now
attempting
to
ascend
were
of
the
same
material
and
so
excessively
slippery
being
wet
that
we
could
get
but
little
foothold
upon
them
even
in
their
least
precipitous
parts
in
some
places
where
the
ascent
was
nearly
perpendicular
the
difficulty
was
of
course
much
aggravated
and
indeed
for
some
time
we
thought
insurmountable
we
took
courage
however
from
despair
and
what
by
dint
of
cutting
steps
in
the
soft
stone
with
our
bowie
knives
and
swinging
at
the
risk
of
our
lives
to
small
projecting
points
of
a
harder
species
of
slaty
rock
which
now
and
then
protruded
from
the
general
mass
we
at
length
reached
a
natural
platform
from
which
was
perceptible
a
patch
of
blue
sky
at
the
extremity
of
a
thickly-wooded
ravine
looking
back
now
with
somewhat
more
leisure
at
the
passage
through
which
we
had
thus
far
proceeded
we
clearly
saw
from
the
appearance
of
its
sides
that
it
was
of
late
formation
and
we
concluded
that
the
concussion
whatever
it
was
which
had
so
unexpectedly
overwhelmed
us
had
also
at
the
same
moment
laid
open
this
path
for
escape
being
quite
exhausted
with
exertion
and
indeed
so
weak
that
we
were
scarcely
able
to
stand
or
articulate
peters
now
proposed
that
we
should
endeavour
to
bring
our
companions
to
the
rescue
by
firing
the
pistols
which
still
remained
in
our
girdles--the
muskets
as
well
as
cutlasses
had
been
lost
among
the
loose
earth
at
the
bottom
of
the
chasm
subsequent
events
proved
that
had
we
fired
we
should
have
sorely
repented
it
but
luckily
a
half
suspicion
of
foul
play
had
by
this
time
arisen
in
my
mind
and
we
forbore
to
let
the
savages
know
of
our
whereabouts
after
having
reposed
for
about
an
hour
we
pushed
on
slowly
up
the
ravine
and
had
gone
no
great
way
before
we
heard
a
succession
of
tremendous
yells
at
length
we
reached
what
might
be
called
the
surface
of
the
ground
for
our
path
hitherto
since
leaving
the
platform
had
lain
beneath
an
archway
of
high
rock
and
foliage
at
a
vast
distance
overhead
with
great
caution
we
stole
to
a
narrow
opening
through
which
we
had
a
clear
sight
of
the
surrounding
country
when
the
whole
dreadful
secret
of
the
concussion
broke
upon
us
in
one
moment
and
at
one
view
the
spot
from
which
we
looked
was
not
far
from
the
summit
of
the
highest
peak
in
the
range
of
the
soapstone
hills
the
gorge
in
which
our
party
of
thirty-two
had
entered
ran
within
fifty
feet
to
the
left
of
us
but
for
at
least
one
hundred
yards
the
channel
or
bed
of
this
gorge
was
entirely
filled
up
with
the
chaotic
ruins
of
more
than
a
million
tons
of
earth
and
stone
that
had
been
artificially
tumbled
within
it
the
means
by
which
the
vast
mass
had
been
precipitated
were
not
more
simple
than
evident
for
sure
traces
of
the
murderous
work
were
yet
remaining
in
several
spots
along
the
top
of
the
eastern
side
of
the
gorge
we
were
now
on
the
western
might
be
seen
stakes
of
wood
driven
into
the
earth
in
these
spots
the
earth
had
not
given
way
but
throughout
the
whole
extent
of
the
face
of
the
precipice
from
which
the
mass
had
fallen
it
was
clear
from
marks
left
in
the
soil
resembling
those
made
by
the
drill
of
the
rock
blaster
that
stakes
similar
to
those
we
saw
standing
had
been
inserted
at
not
more
than
a
yard
apart
for
the
length
of
perhaps
three
hundred
feet
and
ranging
at
about
ten
feet
back
from
the
edge
of
the
gulf
strong
cords
of
grape
vine
were
attached
to
the
stakes
still
remaining
on
the
hill
and
it
was
evident
that
such
cords
had
also
been
attached
to
each
of
the
other
stakes
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
singular
stratification
of
these
soapstone
hills
and
the
description
just
given
of
the
narrow
and
deep
fissure
through
which
we
effected
our
escape
from
inhumation
will
afford
a
further
conception
of
its
nature
this
was
such
that
almost
every
natural
convulsion
would
be
sure
to
split
the
soil
into
perpendicular
layers
or
ridges
running
parallel
with
one
another
and
a
very
moderate
exertion
of
art
would
be
sufficient
for
effecting
the
same
purpose
of
this
stratification
the
savages
had
availed
themselves
to
accomplish
their
treacherous
ends
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
by
the
continuous
line
of
stakes
a
partial
rupture
of
the
soil
had
been
brought
about
probably
to
the
depth
of
one
or
two
feet
when
by
means
of
a
savage
pulling
at
the
end
of
each
of
the
cords
these
cords
being
attached
to
the
tops
of
the
stakes
and
extending
back
from
the
edge
of
the
cliff
a
vast
leverage
power
was
obtained
capable
of
hurling
the
whole
face
of
the
hill
upon
a
given
signal
into
the
bosom
of
the
abyss
below
the
fate
of
our
poor
companions
was
no
longer
a
matter
of
uncertainty
we
alone
had
escaped
from
the
tempest
of
that
overwhelming
destruction
we
were
the
only
living
white
men
upon
the
island
our
situation
as
it
now
appeared
was
scarcely
less
dreadful
than
when
we
had
conceived
ourselves
entombed
forever
we
saw
before
us
no
prospect
but
that
of
being
put
to
death
by
the
savages
or
of
dragging
out
a
miserable
existence
in
captivity
among
them
we
might
to
be
sure
conceal
ourselves
for
a
time
from
their
observation
among
the
fastnesses
of
the
hills
and
as
a
final
resort
in
the
chasm
from
which
we
had
just
issued
but
we
must
either
perish
in
the
long
polar
winter
through
cold
and
famine
or
be
ultimately
discovered
in
our
efforts
to
obtain
relief
the
whole
country
around
us
seemed
to
be
swarming
with
savages
crowds
of
whom
we
now
perceived
had
come
over
from
the
islands
to
the
southward
on
flat
rafts
doubtless
with
a
view
of
lending
their
aid
in
the
capture
and
plunder
of
the
jane
the
vessel
still
lay
calmly
at
anchor
in
the
bay
those
on
board
being
apparently
quite
unconscious
of
any
danger
awaiting
them
how
we
longed
at
that
moment
to
be
with
them
either
to
aid
in
effecting
their
escape
or
to
perish
with
them
in
attempting
a
defence
we
saw
no
chance
even
of
warning
them
of
their
danger
without
bringing
immediate
destruction
upon
our
own
heads
with
but
a
remote
hope
of
benefit
to
them
a
pistol
fired
might
suffice
to
apprise
them
that
something
wrong
had
occurred
but
the
report
could
not
possibly
inform
them
that
their
only
prospect
of
safety
lay
in
getting
out
of
the
harbour
forthwith--it
could
not
tell
them
that
no
principles
of
honour
now
bound
them
to
remain
that
their
companions
were
no
longer
among
the
living
upon
hearing
the
discharge
they
could
not
be
more
thoroughly
prepared
to
meet
the
foe
who
were
now
getting
ready
to
attack
than
they
already
were
and
always
had
been
no
good
therefore
and
infinite
harm
would
result
from
our
firing
and
after
mature
deliberation
we
forbore
our
next
thought
was
to
attempt
to
rush
toward
the
vessel
to
seize
one
of
the
four
canoes
which
lay
at
the
head
of
the
bay
and
endeavour
to
force
a
passage
on
board
but
the
utter
impossibility
of
succeeding
in
this
desperate
task
soon
became
evident
the
country
as
i
said
before
was
literally
swarming
with
the
natives
skulking
among
the
bushes
and
recesses
of
the
hills
so
as
not
to
be
observed
from
the
schooner
in
our
immediate
vicinity
especially
and
blockading
the
sole
path
by
which
we
could
hope
to
attain
the
shore
at
the
proper
point
were
stationed
the
whole
party
of
the
black
skin
warriors
with
too-wit
at
their
head
and
apparently
only
waiting
for
some
re-enforcement
to
commence
his
onset
upon
the
jane
the
canoes
too
which
lay
at
the
head
of
the
bay
were
manned
with
savages
unarmed
it
is
true
but
who
undoubtedly
had
arms
within
reach
we
were
forced
therefore
however
unwillingly
to
remain
in
our
place
of
concealment
mere
spectators
of
the
conflict
which
presently
ensued
in
about
half
an
hour
we
saw
some
sixty
or
seventy
rafts
or
flatboats
without
riggers
filled
with
savages
and
coming
round
the
southern
bight
of
the
harbor
they
appeared
to
have
no
arms
except
short
clubs
and
stones
which
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
rafts
immediately
afterward
another
detachment
still
larger
appeared
in
an
opposite
direction
and
with
similar
weapons
the
four
canoes
too
were
now
quickly
filled
with
natives
starting
up
from
the
bushes
at
the
head
of
the
bay
and
put
off
swiftly
to
join
the
other
parties
thus
in
less
time
than
i
have
taken
to
tell
it
and
as
if
by
magic
the
jane
saw
herself
surrounded
by
an
immense
multitude
of
desperadoes
evidently
bent
upon
capturing
her
at
all
hazards
that
they
would
succeed
in
so
doing
could
not
be
doubted
for
an
instant
the
six
men
left
in
the
vessel
however
resolutely
they
might
engage
in
her
defence
were
altogether
unequal
to
the
proper
management
of
the
guns
or
in
any
manner
to
sustain
a
contest
at
such
odds
i
could
hardly
imagine
that
they
would
make
resistance
at
all
but
in
this
was
deceived
for
presently
i
saw
them
get
springs
upon
the
cable
and
bring
the
vesselâ€™s
starboard
broadside
to
bear
upon
the
canoes
which
by
this
time
were
within
pistol
range
the
rafts
being
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
windward
owing
to
some
cause
unknown
but
most
probably
to
the
agitation
of
our
poor
friends
at
seeing
themselves
in
so
hopeless
a
situation
the
discharge
was
an
entire
failure
not
a
canoe
was
hit
or
a
single
savage
injured
the
shots
striking
short
and
ricocheting
over
their
heads
the
only
effect
produced
upon
them
was
astonishment
at
the
unexpected
report
and
smoke
which
was
so
excessive
that
for
some
moments
i
almost
thought
they
would
abandon
their
design
entirely
and
return
to
the
shore
and
this
they
would
most
likely
have
done
had
our
men
followed
up
their
broadside
by
a
discharge
of
small
arms
in
which
as
the
canoes
were
now
so
near
at
hand
they
could
not
have
failed
in
doing
some
execution
sufficient
at
least
to
deter
this
party
from
a
farther
advance
until
they
could
have
given
the
rafts
also
a
broadside
but
in
place
of
this
they
left
the
canoe
party
to
recover
from
their
panic
and
by
looking
about
them
to
see
that
no
injury
had
been
sustained
while
they
flew
to
the
larboard
to
get
ready
for
the
rafts
the
discharge
to
larboard
produced
the
most
terrible
effect
the
star
and
double-headed
shot
of
the
large
guns
cut
seven
or
eight
of
the
rafts
completely
asunder
and
killed
perhaps
thirty
or
forty
of
the
savages
outright
while
a
hundred
of
them
at
least
were
thrown
into
the
water
the
most
of
them
dreadfully
wounded
the
remainder
frightened
out
of
their
senses
commenced
at
once
a
precipitate
retreat
not
even
waiting
to
pick
up
their
maimed
companions
who
were
swimming
about
in
every
direction
screaming
and
yelling
for
aid
this
great
success
however
came
too
late
for
the
salvation
of
our
devoted
people
the
canoe
party
were
already
on
board
the
schooner
to
the
number
of
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
the
most
of
them
having
succeeded
in
scrambling
up
the
chains
and
over
the
boarding-netting
even
before
the
matches
had
been
applied
to
the
larboard
guns
nothing
now
could
withstand
their
brute
rage
our
men
were
borne
down
at
once
overwhelmed
trodden
under
foot
and
absolutely
torn
to
pieces
in
an
instant
seeing
this
the
savages
on
the
rafts
got
the
better
of
their
fears
and
came
up
in
shoals
to
the
plunder
in
five
minutes
the
jane
was
a
pitiable
scene
indeed
of
havoc
and
tumultuous
outrage
the
decks
were
split
open
and
ripped
up
the
cordage
sails
and
everything
movable
on
deck
demolished
as
if
by
magic
while
by
dint
of
pushing
at
the
stern
towing
with
the
canoes
and
hauling
at
the
sides
as
they
swam
in
thousands
around
the
vessel
the
wretches
finally
forced
her
on
shore
the
cable
having
been
slipped
and
delivered
her
over
to
the
good
offices
of
too-wit
who
during
the
whole
of
the
engagement
had
maintained
like
a
skilful
general
his
post
of
security
and
reconnaissance
among
the
hills
but
now
that
the
victory
was
completed
to
his
satisfaction
condescended
to
scamper
down
with
his
warriors
of
the
black
skin
and
become
a
partaker
in
the
spoils
too-witâ€™s
descent
left
us
at
liberty
to
quit
our
hiding
place
and
reconnoitre
the
hill
in
the
vicinity
of
the
chasm
at
about
fifty
yards
from
the
mouth
of
it
we
saw
a
small
spring
of
water
at
which
we
slaked
the
burning
thirst
that
now
consumed
us
not
far
from
the
spring
we
discovered
several
of
the
filbert-bushes
which
i
mentioned
before
upon
tasting
the
nuts
we
found
them
palatable
and
very
nearly
resembling
in
flavour
the
common
english
filbert
we
collected
our
hats
full
immediately
deposited
them
within
the
ravine
and
returned
for
more
while
we
were
busily
employed
in
gathering
these
a
rustling
in
the
bushes
alarmed
us
and
we
were
upon
the
point
of
stealing
back
to
our
covert
when
a
large
black
bird
of
the
bittern
species
strugglingly
and
slowly
arose
above
the
shrubs
i
was
so
much
startled
that
i
could
do
nothing
but
peters
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
run
up
to
it
before
it
could
make
its
escape
and
seize
it
by
the
neck
its
struggles
and
screams
were
tremendous
and
we
had
thoughts
of
letting
it
go
lest
the
noise
should
alarm
some
of
the
savages
who
might
be
still
lurking
in
the
neighbourhood
a
stab
with
a
bowie
knife
however
at
length
brought
it
to
the
ground
and
we
dragged
it
into
the
ravine
congratulating
ourselves
that
at
all
events
we
had
thus
obtained
a
supply
of
food
enough
to
last
us
for
a
week
we
now
went
out
again
to
look
about
us
and
ventured
a
considerable
distance
down
the
southern
declivity
of
the
hill
but
met
with
nothing
else
which
could
serve
us
for
food
we
therefore
collected
a
quantity
of
dry
wood
and
returned
seeing
one
or
two
large
parties
of
the
natives
on
their
way
to
the
village
laden
with
the
plunder
of
the
vessel
and
who
we
were
apprehensive
might
discover
us
in
passing
beneath
the
hill
our
next
care
was
to
render
our
place
of
concealment
as
secure
as
possible
and
with
this
object
we
arranged
some
brushwood
over
the
aperture
which
i
have
before
spoken
of
as
the
one
through
which
we
saw
the
patch
of
blue
sky
on
reaching
the
platform
from
the
interior
of
the
chasm
we
left
only
a
very
small
opening
just
wide
enough
to
admit
of
our
seeing
the
bay
without
the
risk
of
being
discovered
from
below
having
done
this
we
congratulated
ourselves
upon
the
security
of
the
position
for
we
were
now
completely
excluded
from
observation
as
long
as
we
chose
to
remain
within
the
ravine
itself
and
not
venture
out
upon
the
hill
we
could
perceive
no
traces
of
the
savages
having
ever
been
within
this
hollow
but
indeed
when
we
came
to
reflect
upon
the
probability
that
the
fissure
through
which
we
attained
it
had
been
only
just
now
created
by
the
fall
of
the
cliff
opposite
and
that
no
other
way
of
attaining
it
could
be
perceived
we
were
not
so
much
rejoiced
at
the
thought
of
being
secure
from
molestation
as
fearful
lest
there
should
be
absolutely
no
means
left
us
for
descent
we
resolved
to
explore
the
summit
of
the
hill
thoroughly
when
a
good
opportunity
should
offer
in
the
meantime
we
watched
the
motions
of
the
savages
through
our
loophole
they
had
already
made
a
complete
wreck
of
the
vessel
and
were
now
preparing
to
set
her
on
fire
in
a
little
while
we
saw
the
smoke
ascending
in
huge
volumes
from
her
main
hatchway
and
shortly
afterward
a
dense
mass
of
flame
burst
up
from
the
forecastle
the
rigging
masts
and
what
remained
of
the
sails
caught
immediately
and
the
fire
spread
rapidly
along
the
decks
still
a
great
many
of
the
savages
retained
their
stations
about
her
hammering
with
large
stones
axes
and
cannon
balls
at
the
bolts
and
other
iron
and
copper
work
on
the
beach
and
in
canoes
and
rafts
there
were
not
less
altogether
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
schooner
than
ten
thousand
natives
besides
the
shoals
of
them
who
laden
with
booty
were
making
their
way
inland
and
over
to
the
neighbouring
islands
we
now
anticipated
a
catastrophe
and
were
not
disappointed
first
of
all
there
came
a
smart
shock
which
we
felt
as
distinctly
where
we
were
as
if
we
had
been
slightly
galvanized
but
unattended
with
any
visible
signs
of
an
explosion
the
savages
were
evidently
startled
and
paused
for
an
instant
from
their
labours
and
yellings
they
were
upon
the
point
of
recommencing
when
suddenly
a
mass
of
smoke
puffed
up
from
the
decks
resembling
a
black
and
heavy
thundercloud--then
as
if
from
its
bowels
arose
a
tall
stream
of
vivid
fire
to
the
height
apparently
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile--then
there
came
a
sudden
circular
expansion
of
the
flame--then
the
whole
atmosphere
was
magically
crowded
in
a
single
instant
with
a
wild
chaos
of
wood
and
metal
and
human
limbs--and
lastly
came
the
concussion
in
its
fullest
fury
which
hurled
us
impetuously
from
our
feet
while
the
hills
echoed
and
re-echoed
the
tumult
and
a
dense
shower
of
the
minutest
fragments
of
the
ruins
tumbled
headlong
in
every
direction
around
us
the
havoc
among
the
savages
far
exceeded
our
utmost
expectation
and
they
had
now
indeed
reaped
the
full
and
perfect
fruits
of
their
treachery
perhaps
a
thousand
perished
by
the
explosion
while
at
least
an
equal
number
were
desperately
mangled
the
whole
surface
of
the
bay
was
literally
strewn
with
the
struggling
and
drowning
wretches
and
on
shore
matters
were
even
worse
they
seemed
utterly
appalled
by
the
suddenness
and
completeness
of
their
discomfiture
and
made
no
efforts
at
assisting
one
another
at
length
we
observed
a
total
change
in
their
demeanour
from
absolute
stupor
they
appeared
to
be
all
at
once
aroused
to
the
highest
pitch
of
excitement
and
rushed
wildly
about
going
to
and
from
a
certain
point
on
the
beach
with
the
strangest
expressions
of
mingled
horror
rage
and
intense
curiosity
depicted
on
their
countenances
and
shouting
at
the
top
of
their
voices
â€œtekeli-li
tekeli-liâ€
presently
we
saw
a
large
body
go
off
into
the
hills
whence
they
returned
in
a
short
time
carrying
stakes
of
wood
these
they
brought
to
the
station
where
the
crowd
was
the
thickest
which
now
separated
so
as
to
afford
us
a
view
of
the
object
of
all
this
excitement
we
perceived
something
white
lying
upon
the
ground
but
could
not
immediately
make
out
what
it
was
at
length
we
saw
that
it
was
the
carcass
of
the
strange
animal
with
the
scarlet
teeth
and
claws
which
the
schooner
had
picked
up
at
sea
on
the
eighteenth
of
january
captain
guy
had
had
the
body
preserved
for
the
purpose
of
stuffing
the
skin
and
taking
it
to
england
i
remember
he
had
given
some
directions
about
it
just
before
our
making
the
island
and
it
had
been
brought
into
the
cabin
and
stowed
away
in
one
of
the
lockers
it
had
now
been
thrown
on
shore
by
the
explosion
but
why
it
had
occasioned
so
much
concern
among
the
savages
was
more
than
we
could
comprehend
although
they
crowded
around
the
carcass
at
a
little
distance
none
of
them
seemed
willing
to
approach
it
closely
by-and-by
the
men
with
the
stakes
drove
them
in
a
circle
around
it
and
no
sooner
was
this
arrangement
completed
than
the
whole
of
the
vast
assemblage
rushed
into
the
interior
of
the
island
with
loud
screams
of
â€œtekeli-li
tekeli-liâ€
during
the
six
or
seven
days
immediately
following
we
remained
in
our
hiding-place
upon
the
hill
going
out
only
occasionally
and
then
with
the
greatest
precaution
for
water
and
filberts
we
had
made
a
kind
of
penthouse
on
the
platform
furnishing
it
with
a
bed
of
dry
leaves
and
placing
in
it
three
large
flat
stones
which
served
us
for
both
fireplace
and
table
we
kindled
a
fire
without
difficulty
by
rubbing
two
pieces
of
dry
wood
together
the
one
soft
the
other
hard
the
bird
we
had
taken
in
such
good
season
proved
excellent
eating
although
somewhat
tough
it
was
not
an
oceanic
fowl
but
a
species
of
bittern
with
jet
black
and
grizzly
plumage
and
diminutive
wings
in
proportion
to
its
bulk
we
afterward
saw
three
of
the
same
kind
in
the
vicinity
of
the
ravine
apparently
seeking
for
the
one
we
had
captured
but
as
they
never
alighted
we
had
no
opportunity
of
catching
them
as
long
as
this
fowl
lasted
we
suffered
nothing
from
our
situation
but
it
was
now
entirely
consumed
and
it
became
absolutely
necessary
that
we
should
look
out
for
provision
the
filberts
would
not
satisfy
the
cravings
of
hunger
afflicting
us
too
with
severe
gripings
of
the
bowels
and
if
freely
indulged
in
with
violent
headache
we
had
seen
several
large
tortoises
near
the
seashore
to
the
eastward
of
the
hill
and
perceived
they
might
be
easily
taken
if
we
could
get
at
them
without
the
observation
of
the
natives
it
was
resolved
therefore
to
make
an
attempt
at
descending
we
commenced
by
going
down
the
southern
declivity
which
seemed
to
offer
the
fewest
difficulties
but
had
not
proceeded
a
hundred
yards
before
as
we
had
anticipated
from
appearances
on
the
hilltop
our
progress
was
entirely
arrested
by
a
branch
of
the
gorge
in
which
our
companions
had
perished
we
now
passed
along
the
edge
of
this
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
we
were
again
stopped
by
a
precipice
of
immense
depth
and
not
being
able
to
make
our
way
along
the
brink
of
it
we
were
forced
to
retrace
our
steps
by
the
main
ravine
we
now
pushed
over
to
the
eastward
but
with
precisely
similar
fortune
after
an
hourâ€™s
scramble
at
the
risk
of
breaking
our
necks
we
discovered
that
we
had
merely
descended
into
a
vast
pit
of
black
granite
with
fine
dust
at
the
bottom
and
whence
the
only
egress
was
by
the
rugged
path
in
which
we
had
come
down
toiling
again
up
this
path
we
now
tried
the
northern
edge
of
the
hill
here
we
were
obliged
to
use
the
greatest
possible
caution
in
our
maneuvers
as
the
least
indiscretion
would
expose
us
to
the
full
view
of
the
savages
in
the
village
we
crawled
along
therefore
on
our
hands
and
knees
and
occasionally
were
even
forced
to
throw
ourselves
at
full
length
dragging
our
bodies
along
by
means
of
the
shrubbery
in
this
careful
manner
we
had
proceeded
but
a
little
way
when
we
arrived
at
a
chasm
far
deeper
than
any
we
had
yet
seen
and
leading
directly
into
the
main
gorge
thus
our
fears
were
fully
confirmed
and
we
found
ourselves
cut
off
entirely
from
access
to
the
world
below
thoroughly
exhausted
by
our
exertions
we
made
the
best
of
our
way
back
to
the
platform
and
throwing
ourselves
upon
the
bed
of
leaves
slept
sweetly
and
soundly
for
some
hours
for
several
days
after
this
fruitless
search
we
were
occupied
in
exploring
every
part
of
the
summit
of
the
hill
in
order
to
inform
ourselves
of
its
actual
resources
we
found
that
it
would
afford
us
no
food
with
the
exception
of
the
unwholesome
filberts
and
a
rank
species
of
scurvy
grass
which
grew
in
a
little
patch
of
not
more
than
four
rods
square
and
would
be
soon
exhausted
on
the
fifteenth
of
february
as
near
as
i
can
remember
there
was
not
a
blade
of
this
left
and
the
nuts
were
growing
scarce
our
situation
therefore
could
hardly
be
more
lamentable
5
on
the
sixteenth
we
again
went
round
the
walls
of
our
prison
in
hope
of
finding
some
avenue
of
escape
but
to
no
purpose
we
also
descended
the
chasm
in
which
we
had
been
overwhelmed
with
the
faint
expectation
of
discovering
through
this
channel
some
opening
to
the
main
ravine
here
too
we
were
disappointed
although
we
found
and
brought
up
with
us
a
musket
on
the
seventeenth
we
set
out
with
the
determination
of
examining
more
thoroughly
the
chasm
of
black
granite
into
which
we
had
made
our
way
in
the
first
search
we
remembered
that
one
of
the
fissures
in
the
sides
of
this
pit
had
been
but
partially
looked
into
and
we
were
anxious
to
explore
it
although
with
no
expectation
of
discovering
here
any
opening
we
found
no
great
difficulty
in
reaching
the
bottom
of
the
hollow
as
before
and
were
now
sufficiently
calm
to
survey
it
with
some
attention
it
was
indeed
one
of
the
most
singular-looking
places
imaginable
and
we
could
scarcely
bring
ourselves
to
believe
it
altogether
the
work
of
nature
the
pit
from
its
eastern
to
its
western
extremity
was
about
five
hundred
yards
in
length
when
all
its
windings
were
threaded
the
distance
from
east
to
west
in
a
straight
line
not
being
more
i
should
suppose
having
no
means
of
accurate
examination
than
forty
or
fifty
yards
upon
first
descending
into
the
chasm
that
is
to
say
for
a
hundred
feet
downward
from
the
summit
of
the
hill
the
sides
of
the
abyss
bore
little
resemblance
to
each
other
and
apparently
had
at
no
time
been
connected
the
one
surface
being
of
the
soapstone
and
the
other
of
marl
granulated
with
some
metallic
matter
the
average
breadth
or
interval
between
the
two
cliffs
was
probably
here
sixty
feet
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
regularity
of
formation
passing
down
however
beyond
the
limit
spoken
of
the
interval
rapidly
contracted
and
the
sides
began
to
run
parallel
although
for
some
distance
farther
they
were
still
dissimilar
in
their
material
and
form
of
surface
upon
arriving
within
fifty
feet
of
the
bottom
a
perfect
regularity
commenced
the
sides
were
now
entirely
uniform
in
substance
in
colour
and
in
lateral
direction
the
material
being
a
very
black
and
shining
granite
and
the
distance
between
the
two
sides
at
all
points
facing
each
other
exactly
twenty
yards
the
precise
formation
of
the
chasm
will
be
best
understood
by
means
of
a
delineation
taken
upon
the
spot
for
i
had
luckily
with
me
a
pocketbook
and
pencil
which
i
preserved
with
great
care
through
a
long
series
of
subsequent
adventure
and
to
which
i
am
indebted
for
memoranda
of
many
subjects
which
would
otherwise
have
been
crowded
from
my
remembrance
this
figure
no
figures
in
text
gives
the
general
outlines
of
the
chasm
without
the
minor
cavities
in
the
sides
of
which
there
were
several
each
cavity
having
a
corresponding
protuberance
opposite
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
was
covered
to
the
depth
of
three
or
four
inches
with
a
powder
almost
impalpable
beneath
which
we
found
a
continuation
of
the
black
granite
to
the
right
at
the
lower
extremity
will
be
noticed
the
appearance
of
a
small
opening
this
is
the
fissure
alluded
to
above
and
to
examine
which
more
minutely
than
before
was
the
object
of
our
second
visit
we
now
pushed
into
it
with
vigor
cutting
away
a
quantity
of
brambles
which
impeded
us
and
removing
a
vast
heap
of
sharp
flints
somewhat
resembling
arrowheads
in
shape
we
were
encouraged
to
persevere
however
by
perceiving
some
little
light
proceeding
from
the
farther
end
we
at
length
squeezed
our
way
for
about
thirty
feet
and
found
that
the
aperture
was
a
low
and
regularly
formed
arch
having
a
bottom
of
the
same
impalpable
powder
as
that
in
the
main
chasm
a
strong
light
now
broke
upon
us
and
turning
a
short
bend
we
found
ourselves
in
another
lofty
chamber
similar
to
the
one
we
had
left
in
every
respect
but
longitudinal
form
its
general
figure
is
here
given
the
total
length
of
this
chasm
commencing
at
the
opening
a
and
proceeding
round
the
curve
b
to
the
extremity
d
is
five
hundred
and
fifty
yards
at
c
we
discovered
a
small
aperture
similar
to
the
one
through
which
we
had
issued
from
the
other
chasm
and
this
was
choked
up
in
the
same
manner
with
brambles
and
a
quantity
of
the
white
arrowhead
flints
we
forced
our
way
through
it
finding
it
about
forty
feet
long
and
emerged
into
a
third
chasm
this
too
was
precisely
like
the
first
except
in
its
longitudinal
shape
which
was
thus
we
found
the
entire
length
of
the
third
chasm
three
hundred
and
twenty
yards
at
the
point
a
was
an
opening
about
six
feet
wide
and
extending
fifteen
feet
into
the
rock
where
it
terminated
in
a
bed
of
marl
there
being
no
other
chasm
beyond
as
we
had
expected
we
were
about
leaving
this
fissure
into
which
very
little
light
was
admitted
when
peters
called
my
attention
to
a
range
of
singular-looking
indentures
in
the
surface
of
the
marl
forming
the
termination
of
the
cul-de-sac
with
a
very
slight
exertion
of
the
imagination
the
left
or
most
northern
of
these
indentures
might
have
been
taken
for
the
intentional
although
rude
representation
of
a
human
figure
standing
erect
with
outstretched
arm
the
rest
of
them
bore
also
some
little
resemblance
to
alphabetical
characters
and
peters
was
willing
at
all
events
to
adopt
the
idle
opinion
that
they
were
really
such
i
convinced
him
of
his
error
finally
by
directing
his
attention
to
the
floor
of
the
fissure
where
among
the
powder
we
picked
up
piece
by
piece
several
large
flakes
of
the
marl
which
had
evidently
been
broken
off
by
some
convulsion
from
the
surface
where
the
indentures
were
found
and
which
had
projecting
points
exactly
fitting
the
indentures
thus
proving
them
to
have
been
the
work
of
nature
after
satisfying
ourselves
that
these
singular
caverns
afforded
us
no
means
of
escape
from
our
prison
we
made
our
way
back
dejected
and
dispirited
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
nothing
worth
mentioning
occurred
during
the
next
twenty-four
hours
except
that
in
examining
the
ground
to
the
eastward
of
the
third
chasm
we
found
two
triangular
holes
of
great
depth
and
also
with
black
granite
sides
into
these
holes
we
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
attempt
descending
as
they
had
the
appearance
of
mere
natural
wells
without
outlet
they
were
each
about
twenty
yards
in
circumference
and
their
shape
as
well
as
relative
position
in
regard
to
the
third
chasm
is
shown
in
figure
5
image
on
the
twentieth
of
the
month
finding
it
altogether
impossible
to
subsist
any
longer
upon
the
filberts
the
use
of
which
occasioned
us
the
most
excruciating
torment
we
resolved
to
make
a
desperate
attempt
at
descending
the
southern
declivity
of
the
hill
the
face
of
the
precipice
was
here
of
the
softest
species
of
soapstone
although
nearly
perpendicular
throughout
its
whole
extent
a
depth
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
at
the
least
and
in
many
places
even
overarching
after
a
long
search
we
discovered
a
narrow
ledge
about
twenty
feet
below
the
brink
of
the
gulf
upon
this
peters
contrived
to
leap
with
what
assistance
i
could
render
him
by
means
of
our
pocket-handkerchiefs
tied
together
with
somewhat
more
difficulty
i
also
got
down
and
we
then
saw
the
possibility
of
descending
the
whole
way
by
the
process
in
which
we
had
clambered
up
from
the
chasm
when
we
had
been
buried
by
the
fall
of
the
hill--that
is
by
cutting
steps
in
the
face
of
the
soapstone
with
our
knives
the
extreme
hazard
of
the
attempt
can
scarcely
be
conceived
but
as
there
was
no
other
resource
we
determined
to
undertake
it
upon
the
ledge
where
we
stood
there
grew
some
filbert-bushes
and
to
one
of
these
we
made
fast
an
end
of
our
rope
of
handkerchiefs
the
other
end
being
tied
round
petersâ€™
waist
i
lowered
him
down
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
until
the
handkerchiefs
were
stretched
tight
he
now
proceeded
to
dig
a
deep
hole
in
the
soapstone
as
far
in
as
eight
or
ten
inches
sloping
away
the
rock
above
to
the
height
of
a
foot
or
thereabout
so
as
to
allow
of
his
driving
with
the
butt
of
a
pistol
a
tolerably
strong
peg
into
the
levelled
surface
i
then
drew
him
up
for
about
four
feet
when
he
made
a
hole
similar
to
the
one
below
driving
in
a
peg
as
before
and
having
thus
a
resting-place
for
both
feet
and
hands
i
now
unfastened
the
handkerchiefs
from
the
bush
throwing
him
the
end
which
he
tied
to
the
peg
in
the
uppermost
hole
letting
himself
down
gently
to
a
station
about
three
feet
lower
than
he
had
yet
been
that
is
to
the
full
extent
of
the
handkerchiefs
here
he
dug
another
hole
and
drove
another
peg
he
then
drew
himself
up
so
as
to
rest
his
feet
in
the
hole
just
cut
taking
hold
with
his
hands
upon
the
peg
in
the
one
above
it
was
now
necessary
to
untie
the
handkerchiefs
from
the
topmost
peg
with
the
view
of
fastening
them
to
the
second
and
here
he
found
that
an
error
had
been
committed
in
cutting
the
holes
at
so
great
a
distance
apart
however
after
one
or
two
unsuccessful
and
dangerous
attempts
at
reaching
the
knot
having
to
hold
on
with
his
left
hand
while
he
labored
to
undo
the
fastening
with
his
right
he
at
length
cut
the
string
leaving
six
inches
of
it
affixed
to
the
peg
tying
the
handkerchiefs
now
to
the
second
peg
he
descended
to
a
station
below
the
third
taking
care
not
to
go
too
far
down
by
these
means
means
which
i
should
never
have
conceived
of
myself
and
for
which
we
were
indebted
altogether
to
petersâ€™
ingenuity
and
resolution
my
companion
finally
succeeded
with
the
occasional
aid
of
projections
in
the
cliff
in
reaching
the
bottom
without
accident
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
summon
sufficient
resolution
to
follow
him
but
i
did
at
length
attempt
it
peters
had
taken
off
his
shirt
before
descending
and
this
with
my
own
formed
the
rope
necessary
for
the
adventure
after
throwing
down
the
musket
found
in
the
chasm
i
fastened
this
rope
to
the
bushes
and
let
myself
down
rapidly
striving
by
the
vigor
of
my
movements
to
banish
the
trepidation
which
i
could
overcome
in
no
other
manner
this
answered
sufficiently
well
for
the
first
four
or
five
steps
but
presently
i
found
my
imagination
growing
terribly
excited
by
thoughts
of
the
vast
depths
yet
to
be
descended
and
the
precarious
nature
of
the
pegs
and
soapstone
holes
which
were
my
only
support
it
was
in
vain
i
endeavored
to
banish
these
reflections
and
to
keep
my
eyes
steadily
bent
upon
the
flat
surface
of
the
cliff
before
me
the
more
earnestly
i
struggled
not
to
think
the
more
intensely
vivid
became
my
conceptions
and
the
more
horribly
distinct
at
length
arrived
that
crisis
of
fancy
so
fearful
in
all
similar
cases
the
crisis
in
which
we
began
to
anticipate
the
feelings
with
which
we
shall
fall--to
picture
to
ourselves
the
sickness
and
dizziness
and
the
last
struggle
and
the
half
swoon
and
the
final
bitterness
of
the
rushing
and
headlong
descent
and
now
i
found
these
fancies
creating
their
own
realities
and
all
imagined
horrors
crowding
upon
me
in
fact
i
felt
my
knees
strike
violently
together
while
my
fingers
were
gradually
but
certainly
relaxing
their
grasp
there
was
a
ringing
in
my
ears
and
i
said
â€œthis
is
my
knell
of
deathâ€
and
now
i
was
consumed
with
the
irrepressible
desire
of
looking
below
i
could
not
i
would
not
confine
my
glances
to
the
cliff
and
with
a
wild
indefinable
emotion
half
of
horror
half
of
a
relieved
oppression
i
threw
my
vision
far
down
into
the
abyss
for
one
moment
my
fingers
clutched
convulsively
upon
their
hold
while
with
the
movement
the
faintest
possible
idea
of
ultimate
escape
wandered
like
a
shadow
through
my
mind--in
the
next
my
whole
soul
was
pervaded
with
a
longing
to
fall
a
desire
a
yearning
a
passion
utterly
uncontrollable
i
let
go
at
once
my
grasp
upon
the
peg
and
turning
half
round
from
the
precipice
remained
tottering
for
an
instant
against
its
naked
face
but
now
there
came
a
spinning
of
the
brain
a
shrill-sounding
and
phantom
voice
screamed
within
my
ears
a
dusky
fiendish
and
filmy
figure
stood
immediately
beneath
me
and
sighing
i
sunk
down
with
a
bursting
heart
and
plunged
within
its
arms
i
had
swooned
and
peters
had
caught
me
as
i
fell
he
had
observed
my
proceedings
from
his
station
at
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
and
perceiving
my
imminent
danger
had
endeavored
to
inspire
me
with
courage
by
every
suggestion
he
could
devise
although
my
confusion
of
mind
had
been
so
great
as
to
prevent
my
hearing
what
he
said
or
being
conscious
that
he
had
even
spoken
to
me
at
all
at
length
seeing
me
totter
he
hastened
to
ascend
to
my
rescue
and
arrived
just
in
time
for
my
preservation
had
i
fallen
with
my
full
weight
the
rope
of
linen
would
inevitably
have
snapped
and
i
should
have
been
precipitated
into
the
abyss
as
it
was
he
contrived
to
let
me
down
gently
so
as
to
remain
suspended
without
danger
until
animation
returned
this
was
in
about
fifteen
minutes
on
recovery
my
trepidation
had
entirely
vanished
i
felt
a
new
being
and
with
some
little
further
aid
from
my
companion
reached
the
bottom
also
in
safety
we
now
found
ourselves
not
far
from
the
ravine
which
had
proved
the
tomb
of
our
friends
and
to
the
southward
of
the
spot
where
the
hill
had
fallen
the
place
was
one
of
singular
wildness
and
its
aspect
brought
to
my
mind
the
descriptions
given
by
travellers
of
those
dreary
regions
marking
the
site
of
degraded
babylon
not
to
speak
of
the
ruins
of
the
disrupted
cliff
which
formed
a
chaotic
barrier
in
the
vista
to
the
northward
the
surface
of
the
ground
in
every
other
direction
was
strewn
with
huge
tumuli
apparently
the
wreck
of
some
gigantic
structures
of
art
although
in
detail
no
semblance
of
art
could
be
detected
scoria
were
abundant
and
large
shapeless
blocks
of
the
black
granite
intermingled
with
others
of
marl
6
and
both
granulated
with
metal
of
vegetation
there
were
no
traces
whatsoever
throughout
the
whole
of
the
desolate
area
within
sight
several
immense
scorpions
were
seen
and
various
reptiles
not
elsewhere
to
be
found
in
the
high
latitudes
as
food
was
our
most
immediate
object
we
resolved
to
make
our
way
to
the
seacoast
distant
not
more
than
half
a
mile
with
a
view
of
catching
turtle
several
of
which
we
had
observed
from
our
place
of
concealment
on
the
hill
we
had
proceeded
some
hundred
yards
threading
our
route
cautiously
between
the
huge
rocks
and
tumuli
when
upon
turning
a
corner
five
savages
sprung
upon
us
from
a
small
cavern
felling
peters
to
the
ground
with
a
blow
from
a
club
as
he
fell
the
whole
party
rushed
upon
him
to
secure
their
victim
leaving
me
time
to
recover
from
my
astonishment
i
still
had
the
musket
but
the
barrel
had
received
so
much
injury
in
being
thrown
from
the
precipice
that
i
cast
it
aside
as
useless
preferring
to
trust
my
pistols
which
had
been
carefully
preserved
in
order
with
these
i
advanced
upon
the
assailants
firing
one
after
the
other
in
quick
succession
two
savages
fell
and
one
who
was
in
the
act
of
thrusting
a
spear
into
peters
sprung
to
his
feet
without
accomplishing
his
purpose
my
companion
being
thus
released
we
had
no
further
difficulty
he
had
his
pistols
also
but
prudently
declined
using
them
confiding
in
his
great
personal
strength
which
far
exceeded
that
of
any
person
i
have
ever
known
seizing
a
club
from
one
of
the
savages
who
had
fallen
he
dashed
out
the
brains
of
the
three
who
remained
killing
each
instantaneously
with
a
single
blow
of
the
weapon
and
leaving
us
completely
masters
of
the
field
so
rapidly
had
these
events
passed
that
we
could
scarcely
believe
in
their
reality
and
were
standing
over
the
bodies
of
the
dead
in
a
species
of
stupid
contemplation
when
we
were
brought
to
recollection
by
the
sound
of
shouts
in
the
distance
it
was
clear
that
the
savages
had
been
alarmed
by
the
firing
and
that
we
had
little
chance
of
avoiding
discovery
to
regain
the
cliff
it
would
be
necessary
to
proceed
in
the
direction
of
the
shouts
and
even
should
we
succeed
in
arriving
at
its
base
we
should
never
be
able
to
ascend
it
without
being
seen
our
situation
was
one
of
the
greatest
peril
and
we
were
hesitating
in
which
path
to
commence
a
flight
when
one
of
the
savages
whom
i
had
shot
and
supposed
dead
sprang
briskly
to
his
feet
and
attempted
to
make
his
escape
we
overtook
him
however
before
he
had
advanced
many
paces
and
were
about
to
put
him
to
death
when
peters
suggested
that
we
might
derive
some
benefit
from
forcing
him
to
accompany
us
in
our
attempt
to
escape
we
therefore
dragged
him
with
us
making
him
understand
that
we
would
shoot
him
if
he
offered
resistance
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
perfectly
submissive
and
ran
by
our
sides
as
we
pushed
in
among
the
rocks
making
for
the
seashore
so
far
the
irregularities
of
the
ground
we
had
been
traversing
hid
the
sea
except
at
intervals
from
our
sight
and
when
we
first
had
it
fairly
in
view
it
was
perhaps
two
hundred
yards
distant
as
we
emerged
into
the
open
beach
we
saw
to
our
great
dismay
an
immense
crowd
of
the
natives
pouring
from
the
village
and
from
all
visible
quarters
of
the
island
making
toward
us
with
gesticulations
of
extreme
fury
and
howling
like
wild
beasts
we
were
upon
the
point
of
turning
upon
our
steps
and
trying
to
secure
a
retreat
among
the
fastnesses
of
the
rougher
ground
when
i
discovered
the
bows
of
two
canoes
projecting
from
behind
a
large
rock
which
ran
out
into
the
water
toward
these
we
now
ran
with
all
speed
and
reaching
them
found
them
unguarded
and
without
any
other
freight
than
three
of
the
large
gallipago
turtles
and
the
usual
supply
of
paddles
for
sixty
rowers
we
instantly
took
possession
of
one
of
them
and
forcing
our
captive
on
board
pushed
out
to
sea
with
all
the
strength
we
could
command
we
had
not
made
however
more
than
fifty
yards
from
the
shore
before
we
became
sufficiently
calm
to
perceive
the
great
oversight
of
which
we
had
been
guilty
in
leaving
the
other
canoe
in
the
power
of
the
savages
who
by
this
time
were
not
more
than
twice
as
far
from
the
beach
as
ourselves
and
were
rapidly
advancing
to
the
pursuit
no
time
was
now
to
be
lost
our
hope
was
at
best
a
forlorn
one
but
we
had
none
other
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
with
the
utmost
exertion
we
could
get
back
in
time
to
anticipate
them
in
taking
possession
of
the
canoe
but
yet
there
was
a
chance
that
we
could
we
might
save
ourselves
if
we
succeeded
while
not
to
make
the
attempt
was
to
resign
ourselves
to
inevitable
butchery
the
canoe
was
modelled
with
the
bow
and
stern
alike
and
in
place
of
turning
it
around
we
merely
changed
our
position
in
paddling
as
soon
as
the
savages
perceived
this
they
redoubled
their
yells
as
well
as
their
speed
and
approached
with
inconceivable
rapidity
we
pulled
however
with
all
the
energy
of
desperation
and
arrived
at
the
contested
point
before
more
than
one
of
the
natives
had
attained
it
this
man
paid
dearly
for
his
superior
agility
peters
shooting
him
through
the
head
with
a
pistol
as
he
approached
the
shore
the
foremost
among
the
rest
of
his
party
were
probably
some
twenty
or
thirty
paces
distant
as
we
seized
upon
the
canoe
we
at
first
endeavored
to
pull
her
into
the
deep
water
beyond
the
reach
of
the
savages
but
finding
her
too
firmly
aground
and
there
being
no
time
to
spare
peters
with
one
or
two
heavy
strokes
from
the
butt
of
the
musket
succeeded
in
dashing
out
a
large
portion
of
the
bow
and
of
one
side
we
then
pushed
off
two
of
the
natives
by
this
time
had
got
hold
of
our
boat
obstinately
refusing
to
let
go
until
we
were
forced
to
despatch
them
with
our
knives
we
were
now
clear
off
and
making
great
way
out
to
sea
the
main
body
of
the
savages
upon
reaching
the
broken
canoe
set
up
the
most
tremendous
yell
of
rage
and
disappointment
conceivable
in
truth
from
everything
i
could
see
of
these
wretches
they
appeared
to
be
the
most
wicked
hypocritical
vindictive
bloodthirsty
and
altogether
fiendish
race
of
men
upon
the
face
of
the
globe
it
is
clear
we
should
have
had
no
mercy
had
we
fallen
into
their
hands
they
made
a
mad
attempt
at
following
us
in
the
fractured
canoe
but
finding
it
useless
again
vented
their
rage
in
a
series
of
hideous
vociferations
and
rushed
up
into
the
hills
we
were
thus
relieved
from
immediate
danger
but
our
situation
was
still
sufficiently
gloomy
we
knew
that
four
canoes
of
the
kind
we
had
were
at
one
time
in
the
possession
of
the
savages
and
were
not
aware
of
the
fact
afterward
ascertained
from
our
captive
that
two
of
these
had
been
blown
to
pieces
in
the
explosion
of
the
jane
guy
we
calculated
therefore
upon
being
yet
pursued
as
soon
as
our
enemies
could
get
round
to
the
bay
distant
about
three
miles
where
the
boats
were
usually
laid
up
fearing
this
we
made
every
exertion
to
leave
the
island
behind
us
and
went
rapidly
through
the
water
forcing
the
prisoner
to
take
a
paddle
in
about
half
an
hour
when
we
had
gained
probably
five
or
six
miles
to
the
southward
a
large
fleet
of
the
flat-bottomed
canoes
or
rafts
were
seen
to
emerge
from
the
bay
evidently
with
the
design
of
pursuit
presently
they
put
back
despairing
to
overtake
us
we
now
found
ourselves
in
the
wide
and
desolate
antarctic
ocean
in
a
latitude
exceeding
eighty-four
degrees
in
a
frail
canoe
and
with
no
provision
but
the
three
turtles
the
long
polar
winter
too
could
not
be
considered
as
far
distant
and
it
became
necessary
that
we
should
deliberate
well
upon
the
course
to
be
pursued
there
were
six
or
seven
islands
in
sight
belonging
to
the
same
group
and
distant
from
each
other
about
five
or
six
leagues
but
upon
neither
of
these
had
we
any
intention
to
venture
in
coming
from
the
northward
in
the
jane
guy
we
had
been
gradually
leaving
behind
us
the
severest
regions
of
ice--this
however
little
it
maybe
in
accordance
with
the
generally
received
notions
respecting
the
antarctic
was
a
fact--experience
would
not
permit
us
to
deny
to
attempt
therefore
getting
back
would
be
folly--especially
at
so
late
a
period
of
the
season
only
one
course
seemed
to
be
left
open
for
hope
we
resolved
to
steer
boldly
to
the
southward
where
there
was
at
least
a
probability
of
discovering
other
lands
and
more
than
a
probability
of
finding
a
still
milder
climate
so
far
we
had
found
the
antarctic
like
the
arctic
ocean
peculiarly
free
from
violent
storms
or
immoderately
rough
water
but
our
canoe
was
at
best
of
frail
structure
although
large
and
we
set
busily
to
work
with
a
view
of
rendering
her
as
safe
as
the
limited
means
in
our
possession
would
admit
the
body
of
the
boat
was
of
no
better
material
than
bark--the
bark
of
a
tree
unknown
the
ribs
were
of
a
tough
osier
well
adapted
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
used
we
had
fifty
feet
room
from
stem
to
stern
from
four
to
six
in
breadth
and
in
depth
throughout
four
feet
and
a
half-the
boats
thus
differing
vastly
in
shape
from
those
of
any
other
inhabitants
of
the
southern
ocean
with
whom
civilized
nations
are
acquainted
we
never
did
believe
them
the
workmanship
of
the
ignorant
islanders
who
owned
them
and
some
days
after
this
period
discovered
by
questioning
our
captive
that
they
were
in
fact
made
by
the
natives
of
a
group
to
the
southwest
of
the
country
where
we
found
them
having
fallen
accidentally
into
the
hands
of
our
barbarians
what
we
could
do
for
the
security
of
our
boat
was
very
little
indeed
several
wide
rents
were
discovered
near
both
ends
and
these
we
contrived
to
patch
up
with
pieces
of
woollen
jacket
with
the
help
of
the
superfluous
paddles
of
which
there
were
a
great
many
we
erected
a
kind
of
framework
about
the
bow
so
as
to
break
the
force
of
any
seas
which
might
threaten
to
fill
us
in
that
quarter
we
also
set
up
two
paddle-blades
for
masts
placing
them
opposite
each
other
one
by
each
gunwale
thus
saving
the
necessity
of
a
yard
to
these
masts
we
attached
a
sail
made
of
our
shirts-doing
this
with
some
difficulty
as
here
we
could
get
no
assistance
from
our
prisoner
whatever
although
he
had
been
willing
enough
to
labor
in
all
the
other
operations
the
sight
of
the
linen
seemed
to
affect
him
in
a
very
singular
manner
he
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
touch
it
or
go
near
it
shuddering
when
we
attempted
to
force
him
and
shrieking
out
â€œtekeli-liâ€
having
completed
our
arrangements
in
regard
to
the
security
of
the
canoe
we
now
set
sail
to
the
south-southeast
for
the
present
with
the
view
of
weathering
the
most
southerly
of
the
group
in
sight
this
being
done
we
turned
the
bow
full
to
the
southward
the
weather
could
by
no
means
be
considered
disagreeable
we
had
a
prevailing
and
very
gentle
wind
from
the
northward
a
smooth
sea
and
continual
daylight
no
ice
whatever
was
to
be
seen
nor
did
i
ever
see
one
particle
of
this
after
leaving
the
parallel
of
bennetâ€™s
islet
indeed
the
temperature
of
the
water
was
here
far
too
warm
for
its
existence
in
any
quantity
having
killed
the
largest
of
our
tortoises
and
obtained
from
him
not
only
food
but
a
copious
supply
of
water
we
continued
on
our
course
without
any
incident
of
moment
for
perhaps
seven
or
eight
days
during
which
period
we
must
have
proceeded
a
vast
distance
to
the
southward
as
the
wind
blew
constantly
with
us
and
a
very
strong
current
set
continually
in
the
direction
we
were
pursuing
march
1st
7-many
unusual
phenomena
now--indicated
that
we
were
entering
upon
a
region
of
novelty
and
wonder
a
high
range
of
light
gray
vapor
appeared
constantly
in
the
southern
horizon
flaring
up
occasionally
in
lofty
streaks
now
darting
from
east
to
west
now
from
west
to
east
and
again
presenting
a
level
and
uniform
summit--in
short
having
all
the
wild
variations
of
the
aurora
borealis
the
average
height
of
this
vapor
as
apparent
from
our
station
was
about
twenty-five
degrees
the
temperature
of
the
sea
seemed
to
be
increasing
momentarily
and
there
was
a
very
perceptible
alteration
in
its
color
march
2d-to-day
by
repeated
questioning
of
our
captive
we
came
to
the
knowledge
of
many
particulars
in
regard
to
the
island
of
the
massacre
its
inhabitants
and
customs--but
with
these
how
can
i
now
detain
the
reader
i
may
say
however
that
we
learned
there
were
eight
islands
in
the
group--that
they
were
governed
by
a
common
king
named
tsalemon
or
psalemoun
who
resided
in
one
of
the
smallest
of
the
islands
that
the
black
skins
forming
the
dress
of
the
warriors
came
from
an
animal
of
huge
size
to
be
found
only
in
a
valley
near
the
court
of
the
king--that
the
inhabitants
of
the
group
fabricated
no
other
boats
than
the
flat-bottomed
rafts
the
four
canoes
being
all
of
the
kind
in
their
possession
and
these
having
been
obtained
by
mere
accident
from
some
large
island
in
the
southwest--that
his
own
name
was
nu-nu--that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
bennetâ€™s
islet--and
that
the
appellation
of
the
island
he
had
left
was
tsalal
the
commencement
of
the
words
tsalemon
and
tsalal
was
given
with
a
prolonged
hissing
sound
which
we
found
it
impossible
to
imitate
even
after
repeated
endeavors
and
which
was
precisely
the
same
with
the
note
of
the
black
bittern
we
had
eaten
up
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
march
3d-the
heat
of
the
water
was
now
truly
remarkable
and
in
color
was
undergoing
a
rapid
change
being
no
longer
transparent
but
of
a
milky
consistency
and
hue
in
our
immediate
vicinity
it
was
usually
smooth
never
so
rough
as
to
endanger
the
canoe--but
we
were
frequently
surprised
at
perceiving
to
our
right
and
left
at
different
distances
sudden
and
extensive
agitations
of
the
surface
these
we
at
length
noticed
were
always
preceded
by
wild
flickerings
in
the
region
of
vapor
to
the
southward
march
4th-to-day
with
the
view
of
widening
our
sail
the
breeze
from
the
northward
dying
away
perceptibly
i
took
from
my
coat-pocket
a
white
handkerchief
nu-nu
was
seated
at
my
elbow
and
the
linen
accidentally
flaring
in
his
face
he
became
violently
affected
with
convulsions
these
were
succeeded
by
drowsiness
and
stupor
and
low
murmurings
of
â€œâ€˜tekeli-li
tekeli-liâ€
march
5th-the
wind
had
entirely
ceased
but
it
was
evident
that
we
were
still
hurrying
on
to
the
southward
under
the
influence
of
a
powerful
current
and
now--indeed
it
would
seem
reasonable
that
we
should
experience
some
alarm
at
the
turn
events
were
taking--but
we
felt
none
the
countenance
of
peters
indicated
nothing
of
this
nature
although
it
wore
at
times
an
expression
i
could
not
fathom
the
polar
winter
appeared
to
be
coming
on--but
coming
without
its
terrors
i
felt
a
numbness
of
body
and
mind--a
dreaminess
of
sensation
but
this
was
all
march
6th-the
gray
vapor
had
now
arisen
many
more
degrees
above
the
horizon
and
was
gradually
losing
its
grayness
of
tint
the
heat
of
the
water
was
extreme
even
unpleasant
to
the
touch
and
its
milky
hue
was
more
evident
than
ever
today
a
violent
agitation
of
the
water
occurred
very
close
to
the
canoe
it
was
attended
as
usual
with
a
wild
flaring
up
of
the
vapor
at
its
summit
and
a
momentary
division
at
its
base
a
fine
white
powder
resembling
ashes--but
certainly
not
such--fell
over
the
canoe
and
over
a
large
surface
of
the
water
as
the
flickering
died
away
among
the
vapor
and
the
commotion
subsided
in
the
sea
nu-nu
now
threw
himself
on
his
face
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
no
persuasions
could
induce
him
to
arise
march
7th-this
day
we
questioned
nu-nu
concerning
the
motives
of
his
countrymen
in
destroying
our
companions
but
he
appeared
to
be
too
utterly
overcome
by
terror
to
afford
us
any
rational
reply
he
still
obstinately
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
upon
reiterating
the
questions
as
to
the
motive
made
use
only
of
idiotic
gesticulations
such
as
raising
with
his
forefinger
the
upper
lip
and
displaying
the
teeth
which
lay
beneath
it
these
were
black
we
had
never
before
seen
the
teeth
of
an
inhabitant
of
tsalal
march
8th-to-day
there
floated
by
us
one
of
the
white
animals
whose
appearance
upon
the
beach
at
tsalal
had
occasioned
so
wild
a
commotion
among
the
savages
i
would
have
picked
it
up
but
there
came
over
me
a
sudden
listlessness
and
i
forbore
the
heat
of
the
water
still
increased
and
the
hand
could
no
longer
be
endured
within
it
peters
spoke
little
and
i
knew
not
what
to
think
of
his
apathy
nu-nu
breathed
and
no
more
march
9th-the
whole
ashy
material
fell
now
continually
around
us
and
in
vast
quantities
the
range
of
vapor
to
the
southward
had
arisen
prodigiously
in
the
horizon
and
began
to
assume
more
distinctness
of
form
i
can
liken
it
to
nothing
but
a
limitless
cataract
rolling
silently
into
the
sea
from
some
immense
and
far-distant
rampart
in
the
heaven
the
gigantic
curtain
ranged
along
the
whole
extent
of
the
southern
horizon
it
emitted
no
sound
march
21st-a
sullen
darkness
now
hovered
above
us--but
from
out
the
milky
depths
of
the
ocean
a
luminous
glare
arose
and
stole
up
along
the
bulwarks
of
the
boat
we
were
nearly
overwhelmed
by
the
white
ashy
shower
which
settled
upon
us
and
upon
the
canoe
but
melted
into
the
water
as
it
fell
the
summit
of
the
cataract
was
utterly
lost
in
the
dimness
and
the
distance
yet
we
were
evidently
approaching
it
with
a
hideous
velocity
at
intervals
there
were
visible
in
it
wide
yawning
but
momentary
rents
and
from
out
these
rents
within
which
was
a
chaos
of
flitting
and
indistinct
images
there
came
rushing
and
mighty
but
soundless
winds
tearing
up
the
enkindled
ocean

their
course

darkness
had
materially
increased
relieved
only
by
the
glare
of
the
water
thrown
back
from
the
white
curtain
before
us
many
gigantic
and
pallidly
white
birds
flew
continuously
now
from
beyond
the
veil
and
their
scream
was
the
eternal
tekeli-li
as
they
retreated
from
our
vision
hereupon
nu-nu
stirred
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
but
upon
touching
him
we
found
his
spirit
departed
and
now
we
rushed
into
the
embraces
of
the
cataract
where
a
chasm
threw
itself
open
to
receive
us
but
there
arose
in
our
pathway
a
shrouded
human
figure
very
far
larger
in
its
proportions
than
any
dweller
among
men
and
the
hue
of
the
skin
of
the
figure
was
of
the
perfect
whiteness
of
the
snow
note
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
late
sudden
and
distressing
death
of
mr
pym
are
already
well
known
to
the
public
through
the
medium
of
the
daily
press
it
is
feared
that
the
few
remaining
chapters
which
were
to
have
completed
his
narrative
and
which
were
retained
by
him
while
the
above
were
in
type
for
the
purpose
of
revision
have
been
irrecoverably
lost
through
the
accident
by
which
he
perished
himself
this
however
may
prove
not
to
be
the
case
and
the
papers
if
ultimately
found
will
be
given
to
the
public
no
means
have
been
left
untried
to
remedy
the
deficiency
the
gentleman
whose
name
is
mentioned
in
the
preface
and
who
from
the
statement
there
made
might
be
supposed
able
to
fill
the
vacuum
has
declined
the
task--this
for
satisfactory
reasons
connected
with
the
general
inaccuracy
of
the
details
afforded
him
and
his
disbelief
in
the
entire
truth
of
the
latter
portions
of
the
narration
peters
from
whom
some
information
might
be
expected
is
still
alive
and
a
resident
of
illinois
but
cannot
be
met
with
at
present
he
may
hereafter
be
found
and
will
no
doubt
afford
material
for
a
conclusion
of
mr
pymâ€™s
account
the
loss
of
two
or
three
final
chapters
for
there
were
but
two
or
three
is
the
more
deeply
to
be
regretted
as
it
can
not
be
doubted
they
contained
matter
relative
to
the
pole
itself
or
at
least
to
regions
in
its
very
near
proximity
and
as
too
the
statements
of
the
author
in
relation
to
these
regions
may
shortly
be
verified
or
contradicted
by
means
of
the
governmental
expedition
now
preparing
for
the
southern
ocean
on
one
point
in
the
narrative
some
remarks
may
well
be
offered
and
it
would
afford
the
writer
of
this
appendix
much
pleasure
if
what
he
may
here
observe
should
have
a
tendency
to
throw
credit
in
any
degree
upon
the
very
singular
pages
now
published
we
allude
to
the
chasms
found
in
the
island
of
tsalal
and
to
the
whole
of
the
figures
upon
pages
245-47
of
the
printed
edition--ed
note
no
figures
were
included
with
this
text
mr
pym
has
given
the
figures
of
the
chasms
without
comment
and
speaks
decidedly
of
the
indentures
found
at
the
extremity
of
the
most
easterly
of
these
chasms
as
having
but
a
fanciful
resemblance
to
alphabetical
characters
and
in
short
as
being
positively
not
such
this
assertion
is
made
in
a
manner
so
simple
and
sustained
by
a
species
of
demonstration
so
conclusive
viz
the
fitting
of
the
projections
of
the
fragments
found
among
the
dust
into
the
indentures
upon
the
wall
that
we
are
forced
to
believe
the
writer
in
earnest
and
no
reasonable
reader
should
suppose
otherwise
but
as
the
facts
in
relation
to
all
the
figures
are
most
singular
especially
when
taken
in
connection
with
statements
made
in
the
body
of
the
narrative
it
may
be
as
well
to
say
a
word
or
two
concerning
them
all--this
too
the
more
especially
as
the
facts
in
question
have
beyond
doubt
escaped
the
attention
of
mr
poe

3
and

when
conjoined
with
one
another
in
the
precise
order
which
the
chasms
themselves
presented
and
when
deprived
of
the
small
lateral
branches
or
arches
which
it
will
be
remembered
served
only
as
a
means
of
communication
between
the
main
chambers
and
were
of
totally
distinct
character
constitute
an
ethiopian
verbal
root--the
root
â€œto
be
shadyâ€™--whence
all
the
inflections
of
shadow
or
darkness
in
regard
to
the
â€œleft
or
most
northwardlyâ€
of
the
indentures
in
figure
4
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
opinion
of
peters
was
correct
and
that
the
hieroglyphical
appearance
was
really
the
work
of
art
and
intended
as
the
representation
of
a
human
form
the
delineation
is
before
the
reader
and
he
may
or
may
not
perceive
the
resemblance
suggested
but
the
rest
of
the
indentures
afford
strong
confirmation
of
petersâ€™
idea
the
upper
range
is
evidently
the
arabic
verbal
root
â€œto
be
whiteâ€
whence
all
the
inflections
of
brilliancy
and
whiteness
the
lower
range
is
not
so
immediately
perspicuous
the
characters
are
somewhat
broken
and
disjointed
nevertheless
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
in
their
perfect
state
they
formed
the
full
egyptian
word
â€œthe
region
of
the
southâ€
it
should
be
observed
that
these
interpretations
confirm
the
opinion
of
peters
in
regard
to
the
â€œmost
northwardlyâ€
of
the
figures
the
arm
is
outstretched
toward
the
south
conclusions
such
as
these
open
a
wide
field
for
speculation
and
exciting
conjecture
they
should
be
regarded
perhaps
in
connection
with
some
of
the
most
faintly
detailed
incidents
of
the
narrative
although
in
no
visible
manner
is

that

the
appellation
of
the

the

may
be
found
upon
minute
philological
scrutiny
to
betray
either
some
alliance
with
the
chasms
themselves

some
reference
to
the
ethiopian
characters

mysteriously

in

so
remarkably
similar
to
our

that
i
cannot
forbear
alluding
to
it
here
this
vessel
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
tons

sailed
from

with
a
cargo
of
lumber
and
provisions
for
santa

on
the
twelfth
of

the

of

casneau

were
eight
souls
on

the
captain--the
mate
four
seamen
and
the
cook
together
with
a
mr

and
a
negro
girl
belonging
to
him
on

fifteenth
having
cleared
the

of

she
sprung
a
leak
in
a
gale
of
wind
from
the
southeast
and
was
finally
capsized
but
the
masts
going
by
the
board

afterward
righted
they
remained
in
this
situation
without
fire
and
with
very
little
provision
for
the
period
of
one
hundred
and
ninety-one
days
from

the

landed

the

from

we
gather
these

ends
in
the
following
words
â€œit

natural
to

also

in

that

in
the
first
portion
of

is
here
written
pretend
to
strict
accuracy
in

to
dates
or
latitudes
and
longitudes
having
kept
no

until
after
the
period
of
which
this
first
portion
treats
in
many
instances
i
have
relied
altogether
upon
memory

this
day

rendered
remarkable
by
our
observing
in

huge
wreaths

glanvill
i
cannot
for
my
soul
remember
how
when
or
even
precisely
where
i
first
became
acquainted
with
the
lady
ligeia
long
years
have
since
elapsed
and
my
memory
is
feeble
through
much
suffering
or
perhaps
i
cannot
now
bring
these
points
to
mind
because
in
truth
the
character
of
my
beloved
her
rare
learning
her
singular
yet
placid
cast
of
beauty
and
the
thrilling
and
enthralling
eloquence
of
her
low
musical
language
made
their
way
into
my
heart
by
paces
so
steadily
and
stealthily
progressive
that
they
have
been
unnoticed
and
unknown
yet
i
believe
that
i
met
her
first
and
most
frequently
in
some
large
old
decaying
city
near
the
rhine
of
her
family--i
have
surely
heard
her
speak
that
it
is
of
a
remotely
ancient
date
cannot
be
doubted
ligeia
ligeia
in
studies
of
a
nature
more
than
all
else
adapted
to
deaden
impressions
of
the
outward
world
it
is
by
that
sweet
word
alone--by
ligeia--that
i
bring
before
mine
eyes
in
fancy
the
image
of
her
who
is
no
more
and
now
while
i
write
a
recollection
flashes
upon
me
that
i
have
never
known
the
paternal
name
of
her
who
was
my
friend
and
my
betrothed
and
who
became
the
partner
of
my
studies
and
finally
the
wife
of
my
bosom
was
it
a
playful
charge
on
the
part
of
my
ligeia
or
was
it
a
test
of
my
strength
of
affection
that
i
should
institute
no
inquiries
upon
this
point
or
was
it
rather
a
caprice
of
my
own--a
wildly
romantic
offering
on
the
shrine
of
the
most
passionate
devotion
i
but
indistinctly
recall
the
fact
itself--what
wonder
that
i
have
utterly
forgotten
the
circumstances
which
originated
or
attended
it
and
indeed
if
ever
she
the
wan
and
the
misty-winged
ashtophet
of
idolatrous
egypt
presided
as
they
tell
over
marriages
ill-omened
then
most
surely
she
presided
over
mine
there
is
one
dear
topic
however
on
which
my
memory
fails
me
not
it
is
the
person
of
ligeia
in
stature
she
was
tall
somewhat
slender
and
in
her
latter
days
even
emaciated
i
would
in
vain
attempt
to
portray
the
majesty
the
quiet
ease
of
her
demeanor
or
the
incomprehensible
lightness
and
elasticity
of
her
footfall
she
came
and
departed
as
a
shadow
i
was
never
made
aware
of
her
entrance
into
my
closed
study
save
by
the
dear
music
of
her
low
sweet
voice
as
she
placed
her
marble
hand
upon
my
shoulder
in
beauty
of
face
no
maiden
ever
equalled
her
it
was
the
radiance
of
an
opium-dream--an
airy
and
spirit-lifting
vision
more
wildly
divine
than
the
phantasies
which
hovered
vision
about
the
slumbering
souls
of
the
daughters
of
delos
yet
her
features
were
not
of
that
regular
mould
which
we
have
been
falsely
taught
to
worship
in
the
classical
labors
of
the
heathen
â€œthere
is
no
exquisite
beautyâ€
says
bacon
lord
verulam
speaking
truly
of
all
the
forms
and
genera
of
beauty
â€œwithout
some
strangeness
in
the
proportionâ€
yet
although
i
saw
that
the
features
of
ligeia
were
not
of
a
classic
regularity--although
i
perceived
that
her
loveliness
was
indeed
â€œexquisiteâ€
and
felt
that
there
was
much
of
â€œstrangenessâ€
pervading
it
yet
i
have
tried
in
vain
to
detect
the
irregularity
and
to
trace
home
my
own
perception
of
â€œthe
strangeâ€
i
examined
the
contour
of
the
lofty
and
pale
forehead--it
was
faultless--how
cold
indeed
that
word
when
applied
to
a
majesty
so
divine--the
skin
rivalling
the
purest
ivory
the
commanding
extent
and
repose
the
gentle
prominence
of
the
regions
above
the
temples
and
then
the
raven-black
the
glossy
the
luxuriant
and
naturally-curling
tresses
setting
forth
the
full
force
of
the
homeric
epithet
â€œhyacinthineâ€
i
looked
at
the
delicate
outlines
of
the
nose--and
nowhere
but
in
the
graceful
medallions
of
the
hebrews
had
i
beheld
a
similar
perfection
there
were
the
same
luxurious
smoothness
of
surface
the
same
scarcely
perceptible
tendency
to
the
aquiline
the
same
harmoniously
curved
nostrils
speaking
the
free
spirit
i
regarded
the
sweet
mouth
here
was
indeed
the
triumph
of
all
things
heavenly--the
magnificent
turn
of
the
short
upper
lip--the
soft
voluptuous
slumber
of
the
under--the
dimples
which
sported
and
the
color
which
spoke--the
teeth
glancing
back
with
a
brilliancy
almost
startling
every
ray
of
the
holy
light
which
fell
upon
them
in
her
serene
and
placid
yet
most
exultingly
radiant
of
all
smiles
i
scrutinized
the
formation
of
the
chin--and
here
too
i
found
the
gentleness
of
breadth
the
softness
and
the
majesty
the
fullness
and
the
spirituality
of
the
greek--the
contour
which
the
god
apollo
revealed
but
in
a
dream
to
cleomenes
the
son
of
the
athenian
and
then
i
peered
into
the
large
eyes
of
ligeia
for
eyes
we
have
no
models
in
the
remotely
antique
it
might
have
been
too
that
in
these
eyes
of
my
beloved
lay
the
secret
to
which
lord
verulam
alludes
they
were
i
must
believe
far
larger
than
the
ordinary
eyes
of
our
own
race
they
were
even
fuller
than
the
fullest
of
the
gazelle
eyes
of
the
tribe
of
the
valley
of
nourjahad
yet
it
was
only
at
intervals--in
moments
of
intense
excitement--that
this
peculiarity
became
more
than
slightly
noticeable
in
ligeia
and
at
such
moments
was
her
beauty--in
my
heated
fancy
thus
it
appeared
perhaps--the
beauty
of
beings
either
above
or
apart
from
the
earth--the
beauty
of
the
fabulous
houri
of
the
turk
the
hue
of
the
orbs
was
the
most
brilliant
of
black
and
far
over
them
hung
jetty
lashes
of
great
length
the
brows
slightly
irregular
in
outline
had
the
same
tint
the
â€œstrangenessâ€
however
which
i
found
in
the
eyes
was
of
a
nature
distinct
from
the
formation
or
the
color
or
the
brilliancy
of
the
features
and
must
after
all
be
referred
to
the
expression
ah
word
of
no
meaning
behind
whose
vast
latitude
of
mere
sound
we
intrench
our
ignorance
of
so
much
of
the
spiritual
the
expression
of
the
eyes
of
ligeia
how
for
long
hours
have
i
pondered
upon
it
how
have
i
through
the
whole
of
a
midsummer
night
struggled
to
fathom
it
what
was
it--that
something
more
profound
than
the
well
of
democritus--which
lay
far
within
the
pupils
of
my
beloved
what
was
it
i
was
possessed
with
a
passion
to
discover
those
eyes
those
large
those
shining
those
divine
orbs
they
became
to
me
twin
stars
of
leda
and
i
to
them
devoutest
of
astrologers
there
is
no
point
among
the
many
incomprehensible
anomalies
of
the
science
of
mind
more
thrillingly
exciting
than
the
fact--never
i
believe
noticed
in
the
schools--that
in
our
endeavors
to
recall
to
memory
something
long
forgotten
we
often
find
ourselves
upon
the
very
verge
of
remembrance
without
being
able
in
the
end
to
remember
and
thus
how
frequently
in
my
intense
scrutiny
of
ligeiaâ€™s
eyes
have
i
felt
approaching
the
full
knowledge
of
their
expression--felt
it
approaching--yet
not
quite
be
mine--and
so
at
length
entirely
depart
and
strange
oh
strangest
mystery
of
all
i
found
in
the
commonest
objects
of
the
universe
a
circle
of
analogies
to
that
expression
i
mean
to
say
that
subsequently
to
the
period
when
ligeiaâ€™s
beauty
passed
into
my
spirit
there
dwelling
as
in
a
shrine
i
derived
from
many
existences
in
the
material
world
a
sentiment
such
as
i
felt
always
aroused
within
me
by
her
large
and
luminous
orbs
yet
not
the
more
could
i
define
that
sentiment
or
analyze
or
even
steadily
view
it
i
recognized
it
let
me
repeat
sometimes
in
the
survey
of
a
rapidly-growing
vine--in
the
contemplation
of
a
moth
a
butterfly
a
chrysalis
a
stream
of
running
water
i
have
felt
it
in
the
ocean
in
the
falling
of
a
meteor
i
have
felt
it
in
the
glances
of
unusually
aged
people
and
there
are
one
or
two
stars
in
heaven--one
especially
a
star
of
the
sixth
magnitude
double
and
changeable
to
be
found
near
the
large
star
in
lyra
in
a
telescopic
scrutiny
of
which
i
have
been
made
aware
of
the
feeling
i
have
been
filled
with
it
by
certain
sounds
from
stringed
instruments
and
not
unfrequently
by
passages
from
books
among
innumerable
other
instances
i
well
remember
something
in
a
volume
of
joseph
glanvill
which
perhaps
merely
from
its
quaintness--who
shall
say
never
failed
to
inspire
me
with
the
sentiment--â€œand
the
will
therein
lieth
which
dieth
not
who
knoweth
the
mysteries
of
the
will
with
its
vigor
for
god
is
but
a
great
will
pervading
all
things
by
nature
of
its
intentness
man
doth
not
yield
him
to
the
angels
nor
unto
death
utterly
save
only
through
the
weakness
of
his
feeble
willâ€
length
of
years
and
subsequent
reflection
have
enabled
me
to
trace
indeed
some
remote
connection
between
this
passage
in
the
english
moralist
and
a
portion
of
the
character
of
ligeia
an
intensity
in
thought
action
or
speech
was
possibly
in
her
a
result
or
at
least
an
index
of
that
gigantic
volition
which
during
our
long
intercourse
failed
to
give
other
and
more
immediate
evidence
of
its
existence
of
all
the
women
whom
i
have
ever
known
she
the
outwardly
calm
the
ever-placid
ligeia
was
the
most
violently
a
prey
to
the
tumultuous
vultures
of
stern
passion
and
of
such
passion
i
could
form
no
estimate
save
by
the
miraculous
expansion
of
those
eyes
which
at
once
so
delighted
and
appalled
me--by
the
almost
magical
melody
modulation
distinctness
and
placidity
of
her
very
low
voice--and
by
the
fierce
energy
rendered
doubly
effective
by
contrast
with
her
manner
of
utterance
of
the
wild
words
which
she
habitually
uttered
i
have
spoken
of
the
learning
of
ligeia
it
was
immense--such
as
i
have
never
known
in
woman
in
the
classical
tongues
was
she
deeply
proficient
and
as
far
as
my
own
acquaintance
extended
in
regard
to
the
modern
dialects
of
europe
i
have
never
known
her
at
fault
indeed
upon
any
theme
of
the
most
admired
because
simply
the
most
abstruse
of
the
boasted
erudition
of
the
academy
have
i
ever
found
ligeia
at
fault
how
singularly--how
thrillingly
this
one
point
in
the
nature
of
my
wife
has
forced
itself
at
this
late
period
only
upon
my
attention
i
said
her
knowledge
was
such
as
i
have
never
known
in
woman--but
where
breathes
the
man
who
has
traversed
and
successfully
all
the
wide
areas
of
moral
physical
and
mathematical
science
i
saw
not
then
what
i
now
clearly
perceive
that
the
acquisitions
of
ligeia
were
gigantic
were
astounding
yet
i
was
sufficiently
aware
of
her
infinite
supremacy
to
resign
myself
with
a
child-like
confidence
to
her
guidance
through
the
chaotic
world
of
metaphysical
investigation
at
which
i
was
most
busily
occupied
during
the
earlier
years
of
our
marriage
with
how
vast
a
triumph--with
how
vivid
a
delight--with
how
much
of
all
that
is
ethereal
in
hope--did
i
feel
as
she
bent
over
me
in
studies
but
little
sought--but
less
known--that
delicious
vista
by
slow
degrees
expanding
before
me
down
whose
long
gorgeous
and
all
untrodden
path
i
might
at
length
pass
onward
to
the
goal
of
a
wisdom
too
divinely
precious
not
to
be
forbidden
how
poignant
then
must
have
been
the
grief
with
which
after
some
years
i
beheld
my
well-grounded
expectations
take
wings
to
themselves
and
fly
away
without
ligeia
i
was
but
as
a
child
groping
benighted
her
presence
her
readings
alone
rendered
vividly
luminous
the
many
mysteries
of
the
transcendentalism
in
which
we
were
immersed
wanting
the
radiant
lustre
of
her
eyes
letters
lambent
and
golden
grew
duller
than
saturnian
lead
and
now
those
eyes
shone
less
and
less
frequently
upon
the
pages
over
which
i
pored
ligeia
grew
ill
the
wild
eyes
blazed
with
a
too--too
glorious
effulgence
the
pale
fingers
became
of
the
transparent
waxen
hue
of
the
grave
and
the
blue
veins
upon
the
lofty
forehead
swelled
and
sank
impetuously
with
the
tides
of
the
gentle
emotion
i
saw
that
she
must
die--and
i
struggled
desperately
in
spirit
with
the
grim
azrael
and
the
struggles
of
the
passionate
wife
were
to
my
astonishment
even
more
energetic
than
my
own
there
had
been
much
in
her
stern
nature
to
impress
me
with
the
belief
that
to
her
death
would
have
come
without
its
terrors--but
not
so
words
are
impotent
to
convey
any
just
idea
of
the
fierceness
of
resistance
with
which
she
wrestled
with
the
shadow
i
groaned
in
anguish
at
the
pitiable
spectacle
i
would
have
soothed--i
would
have
reasoned
but
in
the
intensity
of
her
wild
desire
for
life--for
life--but
for
life--solace
and
reason
were
the
uttermost
folly
yet
not
until
the
last
instance
amid
the
most
convulsive
writhings
of
her
fierce
spirit
was
shaken
the
external
placidity
of
her
demeanor
her
voice
grew
more
gentle--grew
more
low--yet
i
would
not
wish
to
dwell
upon
the
wild
meaning
of
the
quietly
uttered
words
my
brain
reeled
as
i
hearkened
entranced
to
a
melody
more
than
mortal--to
assumptions
and
aspirations
which
mortality
had
never
before
known
that
she
loved
me
i
should
not
have
doubted
and
i
might
have
been
easily
aware
that
in
a
bosom
such
as
hers
love
would
have
reigned
no
ordinary
passion
but
in
death
only
was
i
fully
impressed
with
the
strength
of
her
affection
for
long
hours
detaining
my
hand
would
she
pour
out
before
me
the
overflowing
of
a
heart
whose
more
than
passionate
devotion
amounted
to
idolatry
how
had
i
deserved
to
be
so
blessed
by
such
confessions--how
had
i
deserved
to
be
so
cursed
with
the
removal
of
my
beloved
in
the
hour
of
her
making
them
but
upon
this
subject
i
cannot
bear
to
dilate
let
me
say
only
that
in
ligeiaâ€™s
more
than
womanly
abandonment
to
a
love
alas
all
unmerited
all
unworthily
bestowed
i
at
length
recognized
the
principle
of
her
longing
with
so
wildly
earnest
a
desire
for
the
life
which
was
now
fleeing
so
rapidly
away
it
is
this
wild
longing--it
is
this
eager
vehemence
of
desire
for
life--but
for
life--that
i
have
no
power
to
portray--no
utterance
capable
of
expressing
at
high
noon
of
the
night
in
which
she
departed
beckoning
me
peremptorily
to
her
side
she
bade
me
repeat
certain
verses
composed
by
herself
not
many
days
before
i
obeyed
her--they
were
these
lo
â€˜tis
a
gala
night
within
the
lonesome
latter
years
an
angel
throng
bewinged
bedight
in
veils
and
drowned
in
tears
sit
in
a
theatre
to
see
a
play
of
hopes
and
fears
while
the
orchestra
breathes
fitfully
the
music
of
the
spheres
mimes
in
the
form
of
god
on
high
mutter
and
mumble
low
and
hither
and
thither
fly
mere
puppets
they
who
come
and
go
at
bidding
of
vast
formless
things
that
shift
the
scenery
to
and
fro
flapping
from
out
their
condor
wings
invisible
wo
that
motley
drama--oh
be
sure
it
shall
not
be
forgot
with
its
phantom
chased
forever
more
by
a
crowd
that
seize
it
not
through
a
circle
that
ever
returneth
in
to
the
self-same
spot
and
much
of
madness
and
more
of
sin
and
horror
the
soul
of
the
plot
but
see
amid
the
mimic
rout
a
crawling
shape
intrude
a
blood-red
thing
that
writhes
from
out
the
scenic
solitude
it
writhes--it
writhes--with
mortal
pangs
the
mimes
become
its
food
and
the
seraphs
sob
at
vermin
fangs
in
human
gore
imbued
out--out
are
the
lights--out
all
and
over
each
quivering
form
the
curtain
a
funeral
pall
comes
down
with
the
rush
of
a
storm
and
the
angels
all
pallid
and
wan
uprising
unveiling
affirm
that
the
play
is
the
tragedy
â€œmanâ€
and
its
hero
the
conqueror
worm
â€œo
godâ€
half
shrieked
ligeia
leaping
to
her
feet
and
extending
her
arms
aloft
with
a
spasmodic
movement
as
i
made
an
end
of
these
lines--â€œo
god
o
divine
father--shall
these
things
be
undeviatingly
so--shall
this
conqueror
be
not
once
conquered
are
we
not
part
and
parcel
in
thee
who--who
knoweth
the
mysteries
of
the
will
with
its
vigor
man
doth
not
yield
him
to
the
angels
nor
unto
death
utterly
save
only
through
the
weakness
of
his
feeble
willâ€
and
now
as
if
exhausted
with
emotion
she
suffered
her
white
arms
to
fall
and
returned
solemnly
to
her
bed
of
death
and
as
she
breathed
her
last
sighs
there
came
mingled
with
them
a
low
murmur
from
her
lips
i
bent
to
them
my
ear
and
distinguished
again
the
concluding
words
of
the
passage
in
glanvill--â€œman
doth
not
yield
him
to
the
angels
nor
unto
death
utterly
save
only
through
the
weakness
of
his
feeble
willâ€
she
died--and
i
crushed
into
the
very
dust
with
sorrow
could
no
longer
endure
the
lonely
desolation
of
my
dwelling
in
the
dim
and
decaying
city
by
the
rhine
i
had
no
lack
of
what
the
world
calls
wealth
ligeia
had
brought
me
far
more
very
far
more
than
ordinarily
falls
to
the
lot
of
mortals
after
a
few
months
therefore
of
weary
and
aimless
wandering
i
purchased
and
put
in
some
repair
an
abbey
which
i
shall
not
name
in
one
of
the
wildest
and
least
frequented
portions
of
fair
england
the
gloomy
and
dreary
grandeur
of
the
building
the
almost
savage
aspect
of
the
domain
the
many
melancholy
and
time-honored
memories
connected
with
both
had
much
in
unison
with
the
feelings
of
utter
abandonment
which
had
driven
me
into
that
remote
and
unsocial
region
of
the
country
yet
although
the
external
abbey
with
its
verdant
decay
hanging
about
it
suffered
but
little
alteration
i
gave
way
with
a
child-like
perversity
and
perchance
with
a
faint
hope
of
alleviating
my
sorrows
to
a
display
of
more
than
regal
magnificence
within--for
such
follies
even
in
childhood
i
had
imbibed
a
taste
and
now
they
came
back
to
me
as
if
in
the
dotage
of
grief
alas
i
feel
how
much
even
of
incipient
madness
might
have
been
discovered
in
the
gorgeous
and
fantastic
draperies
in
the
solemn
carvings
of
egypt
in
the
wild
cornices
and
furniture
in
the
bedlam
patterns
of
the
carpets
of
tufted
gold
i
had
become
a
bounden
slave
in
the
trammels
of
opium
and
my
labors
and
my
orders
had
taken
a
coloring
from
my
dreams
but
these
absurdities
i
must
not
pause
to
detail
let
me
speak
only
of
that
one
chamber
ever
accursed
whither
in
a
moment
of
mental
alienation
i
led
from
the
altar
as
my
bride--as
the
successor
of
the
unforgotten
ligeia--the
fair-haired
and
blue-eyed
lady
rowena
trevanion
of
tremaine
there
is
no
individual
portion
of
the
architecture
and
decoration
of
that
bridal
chamber
which
is
not
now
visibly
before
me
where
were
the
souls
of
the
haughty
family
of
the
bride
when
through
thirst
of
gold
they
permitted
to
pass
the
threshold
of
an
apartment
so
bedecked
a
maiden
and
a
daughter
so
beloved
i
have
said
that
i
minutely
remember
the
details
of
the
chamber--yet
i
am
sadly
forgetful
on
topics
of
deep
moment--and
here
there
was
no
system
no
keeping
in
the
fantastic
display
to
take
hold
upon
the
memory
the
room
lay
in
a
high
turret
of
the
castellated
abbey
was
pentagonal
in
shape
and
of
capacious
size
occupying
the
whole
southern
face
of
the
pentagon
was
the
sole
window--an
immense
sheet
of
unbroken
glass
from
venice--a
single
pane
and
tinted
of
a
leaden
hue
so
that
the
rays
of
either
the
sun
or
moon
passing
through
it
fell
with
a
ghastly
lustre
on
the
objects
within
over
the
upper
portion
of
this
huge
window
extended
the
trellice-work
of
an
aged
vine
which
clambered
up
the
massy
walls
of
the
turret
the
ceiling
of
gloomy-looking
oak
was
excessively
lofty
vaulted
and
elaborately
fretted
with
the
wildest
and
most
grotesque
specimens
of
a
semi-gothic
semi-druidical
device
from
out
the
most
central
recess
of
this
melancholy
vaulting
depended
by
a
single
chain
of
gold
with
long
links
a
huge
censer
of
the
same
metal
saracenic
in
pattern
and
with
many
perforations
so
contrived
that
there
writhed
in
and
out
of
them
as
if
endued
with
a
serpent
vitality
a
continual
succession
of
parti-colored
fires
some
few
ottomans
and
golden
candelabra
of
eastern
figure
were
in
various
stations
about--and
there
was
the
couch
too--bridal
couch--of
an
indian
model
and
low
and
sculptured
of
solid
ebony
with
a
pall-like
canopy
above
in
each
of
the
angles
of
the
chamber
stood
on
end
a
gigantic
sarcophagus
of
black
granite
from
the
tombs
of
the
kings
over
against
luxor
with
their
aged
lids
full
of
immemorial
sculpture
but
in
the
draping
of
the
apartment
lay
alas
the
chief
phantasy
of
all
the
lofty
walls
gigantic
in
height--even
unproportionably
so--were
hung
from
summit
to
foot
in
vast
folds
with
a
heavy
and
massive-looking
tapestry--tapestry
of
a
material
which
was
found
alike
as
a
carpet
on
the
floor
as
a
covering
for
the
ottomans
and
the
ebony
bed
as
a
canopy
for
the
bed
and
as
the
gorgeous
volutes
of
the
curtains
which
partially
shaded
the
window
the
material
was
the
richest
cloth
of
gold
it
was
spotted
all
over
at
irregular
intervals
with
arabesque
figures
about
a
foot
in
diameter
and
wrought
upon
the
cloth
in
patterns
of
the
most
jetty
black
but
these
figures
partook
of
the
true
character
of
the
arabesque
only
when
regarded
from
a
single
point
of
view
by
a
contrivance
now
common
and
indeed
traceable
to
a
very
remote
period
of
antiquity
they
were
made
changeable
in
aspect
to
one
entering
the
room
they
bore
the
appearance
of
simple
monstrosities
but
upon
a
farther
advance
this
appearance
gradually
departed
and
step
by
step
as
the
visitor
moved
his
station
in
the
chamber
he
saw
himself
surrounded
by
an
endless
succession
of
the
ghastly
forms
which
belong
to
the
superstition
of
the
norman
or
arise
in
the
guilty
slumbers
of
the
monk
the
phantasmagoric
effect
was
vastly
heightened
by
the
artificial
introduction
of
a
strong
continual
current
of
wind
behind
the
draperies--giving
a
hideous
and
uneasy
animation
to
the
whole
in
halls
such
as
these--in
a
bridal
chamber
such
as
this--i
passed
with
the
lady
of
tremaine
the
unhallowed
hours
of
the
first
month
of
our
marriage--passed
them
with
but
little
disquietude
that
my
wife
dreaded
the
fierce
moodiness
of
my
temper--that
she
shunned
me
and
loved
me
but
little--i
could
not
help
perceiving
but
it
gave
me
rather
pleasure
than
otherwise
i
loathed
her
with
a
hatred
belonging
more
to
demon
than
to
man
my
memory
flew
back
oh
with
what
intensity
of
regret
to
ligeia
the
beloved
the
august
the
beautiful
the
entombed
i
revelled
in
recollections
of
her
purity
of
her
wisdom
of
her
lofty
her
ethereal
nature
of
her
passionate
her
idolatrous
love
now
then
did
my
spirit
fully
and
freely
burn
with
more
than
all
the
fires
of
her
own
in
the
excitement
of
my
opium
dreams
for
i
was
habitually
fettered
in
the
shackles
of
the
drug
i
would
call
aloud
upon
her
name
during
the
silence
of
the
night
or
among
the
sheltered
recesses
of
the
glens
by
day
as
if
through
the
wild
eagerness
the
solemn
passion
the
consuming
ardor
of
my
longing
for
the
departed
i
could
restore
her
to
the
pathway
she
had
abandoned--ah
could
it
be
forever--upon
the
earth
about
the
commencement
of
the
second
month
of
the
marriage
the
lady
rowena
was
attacked
with
sudden
illness
from
which
her
recovery
was
slow
the
fever
which
consumed
her
rendered
her
nights
uneasy
and
in
her
perturbed
state
of
half-slumber
she
spoke
of
sounds
and
of
motions
in
and
about
the
chamber
of
the
turret
which
i
concluded
had
no
origin
save
in
the
distemper
of
her
fancy
or
perhaps
in
the
phantasmagoric
influences
of
the
chamber
itself
she
became
at
length
convalescent--finally
well
yet
but
a
brief
period
elapsed
ere
a
second
more
violent
disorder
again
threw
her
upon
a
bed
of
suffering
and
from
this
attack
her
frame
at
all
times
feeble
never
altogether
recovered
her
illnesses
were
after
this
epoch
of
alarming
character
and
of
more
alarming
recurrence
defying
alike
the
knowledge
and
the
great
exertions
of
her
physicians
with
the
increase
of
the
chronic
disease
which
had
thus
apparently
taken
too
sure
hold
upon
her
constitution
to
be
eradicated
by
human
means
i
could
not
fail
to
observe
a
similar
increase
in
the
nervous
irritation
of
her
temperament
and
in
her
excitability
by
trivial
causes
of
fear
she
spoke
again
and
now
more
frequently
and
pertinaciously
of
the
sounds--of
the
slight
sounds--and
of
the
unusual
motions
among
the
tapestries
to
which
she
had
formerly
alluded
one
night
near
the
closing
in
of
september
she
pressed
this
distressing
subject
with
more
than
usual
emphasis
upon
my
attention
she
had
just
awakened
from
an
unquiet
slumber
and
i
had
been
watching
with
feelings
half
of
anxiety
half
of
vague
terror
the
workings
of
her
emaciated
countenance
i
sat
by
the
side
of
her
ebony
bed
upon
one
of
the
ottomans
of
india
she
partly
arose
and
spoke
in
an
earnest
low
whisper
of
sounds
which
she
then
heard
but
which
i
could
not
hear--of
motions
which
she
then
saw
but
which
i
could
not
perceive
the
wind
was
rushing
hurriedly
behind
the
tapestries
and
i
wished
to
show
her
what
let
me
confess
it
i
could
not
all
believe
that
those
almost
inarticulate
breathings
and
those
very
gentle
variations
of
the
figures
upon
the
wall
were
but
the
natural
effects
of
that
customary
rushing
of
the
wind
but
a
deadly
pallor
overspreading
her
face
had
proved
to
me
that
my
exertions
to
reassure
her
would
be
fruitless
she
appeared
to
be
fainting
and
no
attendants
were
within
call
i
remembered
where
was
deposited
a
decanter
of
light
wine
which
had
been
ordered
by
her
physicians
and
hastened
across
the
chamber
to
procure
it
but
as
i
stepped
beneath
the
light
of
the
censer
two
circumstances
of
a
startling
nature
attracted
my
attention
i
had
felt
that
some
palpable
although
invisible
object
had
passed
lightly
by
my
person
and
i
saw
that
there
lay
upon
the
golden
carpet
in
the
very
middle
of
the
rich
lustre
thrown
from
the
censer
a
shadow--a
faint
indefinite
shadow
of
angelic
aspect--such
as
might
be
fancied
for
the
shadow
of
a
shade
but
i
was
wild
with
the
excitement
of
an
immoderate
dose
of
opium
and
heeded
these
things
but
little
nor
spoke
of
them
to
rowena
having
found
the
wine
i
recrossed
the
chamber
and
poured
out
a
gobletful
which
i
held
to
the
lips
of
the
fainting
lady
she
had
now
partially
recovered
however
and
took
the
vessel
herself
while
i
sank
upon
an
ottoman
near
me
with
my
eyes
fastened
upon
her
person
it
was
then
that
i
became
distinctly
aware
of
a
gentle
footfall
upon
the
carpet
and
near
the
couch
and
in
a
second
thereafter
as
rowena
was
in
the
act
of
raising
the
wine
to
her
lips
i
saw
or
may
have
dreamed
that
i
saw
fall
within
the
goblet
as
if
from
some
invisible
spring
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
three
or
four
large
drops
of
a
brilliant
and
ruby
colored
fluid
if
this
i
saw--not
so
rowena
she
swallowed
the
wine
unhesitatingly
and
i
forbore
to
speak
to
her
of
a
circumstance
which
must
after
all
i
considered
have
been
but
the
suggestion
of
a
vivid
imagination
rendered
morbidly
active
by
the
terror
of
the
lady
by
the
opium
and
by
the
hour
yet
i
cannot
conceal
it
from
my
own
perception
that
immediately
subsequent
to
the
fall
of
the
ruby-drops
a
rapid
change
for
the
worse
took
place
in
the
disorder
of
my
wife
so
that
on
the
third
subsequent
night
the
hands
of
her
menials
prepared
her
for
the
tomb
and
on
the
fourth
i
sat
alone
with
her
shrouded
body
in
that
fantastic
chamber
which
had
received
her
as
my
bride--wild
visions
opium-engendered
flitted
shadow-like
before
me
i
gazed
with
unquiet
eye
upon
the
sarcophagi
in
the
angles
of
the
room
upon
the
varying
figures
of
the
drapery
and
upon
the
writhing
of
the
parti-colored
fires
in
the
censer
overhead
my
eyes
then
fell
as
i
called
to
mind
the
circumstances
of
a
former
night
to
the
spot
beneath
the
glare
of
the
censer
where
i
had
seen
the
faint
traces
of
the
shadow
it
was
there
however
no
longer
and
breathing
with
greater
freedom
i
turned
my
glances
to
the
pallid
and
rigid
figure
upon
the
bed
then
rushed
upon
me
a
thousand
memories
of
ligeia--and
then
came
back
upon
my
heart
with
the
turbulent
violence
of
a
flood
the
whole
of
that
unutterable
wo
with
which
i
had
regarded
her
thus
enshrouded
the
night
waned
and
still
with
a
bosom
full
of
bitter
thoughts
of
the
one
only
and
supremely
beloved
i
remained
gazing
upon
the
body
of
rowena
it
might
have
been
midnight
or
perhaps
earlier
or
later
for
i
had
taken
no
note
of
time
when
a
sob
low
gentle
but
very
distinct
startled
me
from
my
revery--i
felt
that
it
came
from
the
bed
of
ebony--the
bed
of
death
i
listened
in
an
agony
of
superstitious
terror--but
there
was
no
repetition
of
the
sound
i
strained
my
vision
to
detect
any
motion
in
the
corpse--but
there
was
not
the
slightest
perceptible
yet
i
could
not
have
been
deceived
i
had
heard
the
noise
however
faint
and
my
soul
was
awakened
within
me
i
resolutely
and
perseveringly
kept
my
attention
riveted
upon
the
body
many
minutes
elapsed
before
any
circumstance
occurred
tending
to
throw
light
upon
the
mystery
at
length
it
became
evident
that
a
slight
a
very
feeble
and
barely
noticeable
tinge
of
color
had
flushed
up
within
the
cheeks
and
along
the
sunken
small
veins
of
the
eyelids
through
a
species
of
unutterable
horror
and
awe
for
which
the
language
of
mortality
has
no
sufficiently
energetic
expression
i
felt
my
heart
cease
to
beat
my
limbs
grow
rigid
where
i
sat
yet
a
sense
of
duty
finally
operated
to
restore
my
self-possession
i
could
no
longer
doubt
that
we
had
been
precipitate
in
our
preparations--that
rowena
still
lived
it
was
necessary
that
some
immediate
exertion
be
made
yet
the
turret
was
altogether
apart
from
the
portion
of
the
abbey
tenanted
by
the
servants--there
were
none
within
call--i
had
no
means
of
summoning
them
to
my
aid
without
leaving
the
room
for
many
minutes--and
this
i
could
not
venture
to
do
i
therefore
struggled
alone
in
my
endeavors
to
call
back
the
spirit
ill
hovering
in
a
short
period
it
was
certain
however
that
a
relapse
had
taken
place
the
color
disappeared
from
both
eyelid
and
cheek
leaving
a
wanness
even
more
than
that
of
marble
the
lips
became
doubly
shrivelled
and
pinched
up
in
the
ghastly
expression
of
death
a
repulsive
clamminess
and
coldness
overspread
rapidly
the
surface
of
the
body
and
all
the
usual
rigorous
illness
immediately
supervened
i
fell
back
with
a
shudder
upon
the
couch
from
which
i
had
been
so
startlingly
aroused
and
again
gave
myself
up
to
passionate
waking
visions
of
ligeia
an
hour
thus
elapsed
when
could
it
be
possible
i
was
a
second
time
aware
of
some
vague
sound
issuing
from
the
region
of
the
bed
i
listened--in
extremity
of
horror
the
sound
came
again--it
was
a
sigh
rushing
to
the
corpse
i
saw--distinctly
saw--a
tremor
upon
the
lips
in
a
minute
afterward
they
relaxed
disclosing
a
bright
line
of
the
pearly
teeth
amazement
now
struggled
in
my
bosom
with
the
profound
awe
which
had
hitherto
reigned
there
alone
i
felt
that
my
vision
grew
dim
that
my
reason
wandered
and
it
was
only
by
a
violent
effort
that
i
at
length
succeeded
in
nerving
myself
to
the
task
which
duty
thus
once
more
had
pointed
out
there
was
now
a
partial
glow
upon
the
forehead
and
upon
the
cheek
and
throat
a
perceptible
warmth
pervaded
the
whole
frame
there
was
even
a
slight
pulsation
at
the
heart
the
lady
lived
and
with
redoubled
ardor
i
betook
myself
to
the
task
of
restoration
i
chafed
and
bathed
the
temples
and
the
hands
and
used
every
exertion
which
experience
and
no
little
medical
reading
could
suggest
but
in
vain
suddenly
the
color
fled
the
pulsation
ceased
the
lips
resumed
the
expression
of
the
dead
and
in
an
instant
afterward
the
whole
body
took
upon
itself
the
icy
chilliness
the
livid
hue
the
intense
rigidity
the
sunken
outline
and
all
the
loathsome
peculiarities
of
that
which
has
been
for
many
days
a
tenant
of
the
tomb
and
again
i
sunk
into
visions
of
ligeia--and
again
what
marvel
that
i
shudder
while
i
write
again
there
reached
my
ears
a
low
sob
from
the
region
of
the
ebony
bed
but
why
shall
i
minutely
detail
the
unspeakable
horrors
of
that
night
why
shall
i
pause
to
relate
how
time
after
time
until
near
the
period
of
the
gray
dawn
this
hideous
drama
of
revivification
was
repeated
how
each
terrific
relapse
was
only
into
a
sterner
and
apparently
more
irredeemable
death
how
each
agony
wore
the
aspect
of
a
struggle
with
some
invisible
foe
and
how
each
struggle
was
succeeded
by
i
know
not
what
of
wild
change
in
the
personal
appearance
of
the
corpse
let
me
hurry
to
a
conclusion
the
greater
part
of
the
fearful
night
had
worn
away
and
she
who
had
been
dead
once
again
stirred--and
now
more
vigorously
than
hitherto
although
arousing
from
a
dissolution
more
appalling
in
its
utter
hopelessness
than
any
i
had
long
ceased
to
struggle
or
to
move
and
remained
sitting
rigidly
upon
the
ottoman
a
helpless
prey
to
a
whirl
of
violent
emotions
of
which
extreme
awe
was
perhaps
the
least
terrible
the
least
consuming
the
corpse
i
repeat
stirred
and
now
more
vigorously
than
before
the
hues
of
life
flushed
up
with
unwonted
energy
into
the
countenance--the
limbs
relaxed--and
save
that
the
eyelids
were
yet
pressed
heavily
together
and
that
the
bandages
and
draperies
of
the
grave
still
imparted
their
charnel
character
to
the
figure
i
might
have
dreamed
that
rowena
had
indeed
shaken
off
utterly
the
fetters
of
death
but
if
this
idea
was
not
even
then
altogether
adopted
i
could
at
least
doubt
no
longer
when
arising
from
the
bed
tottering
with
feeble
steps
with
closed
eyes
and
with
the
manner
of
one
bewildered
in
a
dream
the
thing
that
was
enshrouded
advanced
boldly
and
palpably
into
the
middle
of
the
apartment
i
trembled
not--i
stirred
not--for
a
crowd
of
unutterable
fancies
connected
with
the
air
the
stature
the
demeanor
of
the
figure
rushing
hurriedly
through
my
brain
had
paralyzed--had
chilled
me
into
stone
i
stirred
not--but
gazed
upon
the
apparition
there
was
a
mad
disorder
in
my
thoughts--a
tumult
unappeasable
could
it
indeed
be
the
living
rowena
who
confronted
me
could
it
indeed
be
rowena
at
all--the
fair-haired
the
blue-eyed
lady
rowena
trevanion
of
tremaine
why
why
should
i
doubt
it
the
bandage
lay
heavily
about
the
mouth--but
then
might
it
not
be
the
mouth
of
the
breathing
lady
of
tremaine
and
the
cheeks--there
were
the
roses
as
in
her
noon
of
life--yes
these
might
indeed
be
the
fair
cheeks
of
the
living
lady
of
tremaine
and
the
chin
with
its
dimples
as
in
health
might
it
not
be
hers--but
had
she
then
grown
taller
since
her
malady
what
inexpressible
madness
seized
me
with
that
thought
one
bound
and
i
had
reached
her
feet
shrinking
from
my
touch
she
let
fall
from
her
head
unloosened
the
ghastly
cerements
which
had
confined
it
and
there
streamed
forth
into
the
rushing
atmosphere
of
the
chamber
huge
masses
of
long
and
dishevelled
hair
it
was
blacker
than
the
raven
wings
of
the
midnight
and
now
slowly
opened
the
eyes
of
the
figure
which
stood
before
me
â€œhere
then
at
leastâ€
i
shrieked
aloud
â€œcan
i
never--can
i
never
be
mistaken--these
are
the
full
and
the
black
and
the
wild
eyes--of
my
lost
love--of
the
lady--of
the
lady
ligeiaâ€
morella
itself
by
itself
solely
one
everlasting
and
single
plato
sympos
with
a
feeling
of
deep
yet
most
singular
affection
i
regarded
my
friend
morella
thrown
by
accident
into
her
society
many
years
ago
my
soul
from
our
first
meeting
burned
with
fires
it
had
never
before
known
but
the
fires
were
not
of
eros
and
bitter
and
tormenting
to
my
spirit
was
the
gradual
conviction
that
i
could
in
no
manner
define
their
unusual
meaning
or
regulate
their
vague
intensity
yet
we
met
and
fate
bound
us
together
at
the
altar
and
i
never
spoke
of
passion
nor
thought
of
love
she
however
shunned
society
and
attaching
herself
to
me
alone
rendered
me
happy
it
is
a
happiness
to
wonder
it
is
a
happiness
to
dream
morellaâ€™s
erudition
was
profound
as
i
hope
to
live
her
talents
were
of
no
common
order--her
powers
of
mind
were
gigantic
i
felt
this
and
in
many
matters
became
her
pupil
i
soon
however
found
that
perhaps
on
account
of
her
presburg
education
she
placed
before
me
a
number
of
those
mystical
writings
which
are
usually
considered
the
mere
dross
of
the
early
german
literature
these
for
what
reason
i
could
not
imagine
were
her
favourite
and
constant
study--and
that
in
process
of
time
they
became
my
own
should
be
attributed
to
the
simple
but
effectual
influence
of
habit
and
example
in
all
this
if
i
err
not
my
reason
had
little
to
do
my
convictions
or
i
forget
myself
were
in
no
manner
acted
upon
by
the
ideal
nor
was
any
tincture
of
the
mysticism
which
i
read
to
be
discovered
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
either
in
my
deeds
or
in
my
thoughts
persuaded
of
this
i
abandoned
myself
implicitly
to
the
guidance
of
my
wife
and
entered
with
an
unflinching
heart
into
the
intricacies
of
her
studies
and
then--then
when
poring
over
forbidden
pages
i
felt
a
forbidden
spirit
enkindling
within
me--would
morella
place
her
cold
hand
upon
my
own
and
rake
up
from
the
ashes
of
a
dead
philosophy
some
low
singular
words
whose
strange
meaning
burned
themselves
in
upon
my
memory
and
then
hour
after
hour
would
i
linger
by
her
side
and
dwell
upon
the
music
of
her
voice
until
at
length
its
melody
was
tainted
with
terror
and
there
fell
a
shadow
upon
my
soul
and
i
grew
pale
and
shuddered
inwardly
at
those
too
unearthly
tones
and
thus
joy
suddenly
faded
into
horror
and
the
most
beautiful
became
the
most
hideous
as
hinnon
became
ge-henna
it
is
unnecessary
to
state
the
exact
character
of
those
disquisitions
which
growing
out
of
the
volumes
i
have
mentioned
formed
for
so
long
a
time
almost
the
sole
conversation
of
morella
and
myself
by
the
learned
in
what
might
be
termed
theological
morality
they
will
be
readily
conceived
and
by
the
unlearned
they
would
at
all
events
be
little
understood
the
wild
pantheism
of
fichte
the
modified
paliggenedia
of
the
pythagoreans
and
above
all
the
doctrines
of
identity
as
urged
by
schelling
were
generally
the
points
of
discussion
presenting
the
most
of
beauty
to
the
imaginative
morella
that
identity
which
is
termed
personal
mr
locke
i
think
truly
defines
to
consist
in
the
saneness
of
rational
being
and
since
by
person
we
understand
an
intelligent
essence
having
reason
and
since
there
is
a
consciousness
which
always
accompanies
thinking
it
is
this
which
makes
us
all
to
be
that
which
we
call
ourselves
thereby
distinguishing
us
from
other
beings
that
think
and
giving
us
our
personal
identity
but
the
principium
indivduationis
the
notion
of
that
identity
which
at
death
is
or
is
not
lost
for
ever
was
to
me
at
all
times
a
consideration
of
intense
interest
not
more
from
the
perplexing
and
exciting
nature
of
its
consequences
than
from
the
marked
and
agitated
manner
in
which
morella
mentioned
them
but
indeed
the
time
had
now
arrived
when
the
mystery
of
my
wifeâ€™s
manner
oppressed
me
as
a
spell
i
could
no
longer
bear
the
touch
of
her
wan
fingers
nor
the
low
tone
of
her
musical
language
nor
the
lustre
of
her
melancholy
eyes
and
she
knew
all
this
but
did
not
upbraid
she
seemed
conscious
of
my
weakness
or
my
folly
and
smiling
called
it
fate
she
seemed
also
conscious
of
a
cause
to
me
unknown
for
the
gradual
alienation
of
my
regard
but
she
gave
me
no
hint
or
token
of
its
nature
yet
was
she
woman
and
pined
away
daily
in
time
the
crimson
spot
settled
steadily
upon
the
cheek
and
the
blue
veins
upon
the
pale
forehead
became
prominent
and
one
instant
my
nature
melted
into
pity
but
in
next
i
met
the
glance
of
her
meaning
eyes
and
then
my
soul
sickened
and
became
giddy
with
the
giddiness
of
one
who
gazes
downward
into
some
dreary
and
unfathomable
abyss
shall
i
then
say
that
i
longed
with
an
earnest
and
consuming
desire
for
the
moment
of
morellaâ€™s
decease
i
did
but
the
fragile
spirit
clung
to
its
tenement
of
clay
for
many
days
for
many
weeks
and
irksome
months
until
my
tortured
nerves
obtained
the
mastery
over
my
mind
and
i
grew
furious
through
delay
and
with
the
heart
of
a
fiend
cursed
the
days
and
the
hours
and
the
bitter
moments
which
seemed
to
lengthen
and
lengthen
as
her
gentle
life
declined
like
shadows
in
the
dying
of
the
day
but
one
autumnal
evening
when
the
winds
lay
still
in
heaven
morella
called
me
to
her
bedside
there
was
a
dim
mist
over
all
the
earth
and
a
warm
glow
upon
the
waters
and
amid
the
rich
october
leaves
of
the
forest
a
rainbow
from
the
firmament
had
surely
fallen
â€œit
is
a
day
of
daysâ€
she
said
as
i
approached
â€œa
day
of
all
days
either
to
live
or
die
it
is
a
fair
day
for
the
sons
of
earth
and
life--ah
more
fair
for
the
daughters
of
heaven
and
deathâ€
i
kissed
her
forehead
and
she
continued
â€œi
am
dying
yet
shall
i
liveâ€
â€œmorellaâ€
â€œthe
days
have
never
been
when
thou
couldst
love
me--but
her
whom
in
life
thou
didst
abhor
in
death
thou
shalt
adoreâ€
â€œmorellaâ€
â€œi
repeat
i
am
dying
but
within
me
is
a
pledge
of
that
affection--ah
how
little--which
thou
didst
feel
for
me
morella
and
when
my
spirit
departs
shall
the
child
live--thy
child
and
mine
morellaâ€™s
but
thy
days
shall
be
days
of
sorrow--that
sorrow
which
is
the
most
lasting
of
impressions
as
the
cypress
is
the
most
enduring
of
trees
for
the
hours
of
thy
happiness
are
over
and
joy
is
not
gathered
twice
in
a
life
as
the
roses
of
paestum
twice
in
a
year
thou
shalt
no
longer
then
play
the
teian
with
time
but
being
ignorant
of
the
myrtle
and
the
vine
thou
shalt
bear
about
with
thee
thy
shroud
on
the
earth
as
do
the
moslemin
at
meccaâ€
â€œmorellaâ€
i
cried
â€œmorella
how
knowest
thou
thisâ€
but
she
turned
away
her
face
upon
the
pillow
and
a
slight
tremor
coming
over
her
limbs
she
thus
died
and
i
heard
her
voice
no
more
yet
as
she
had
foretold
her
child
to
which
in
dying
she
had
given
birth
which
breathed
not
until
the
mother
breathed
no
more
her
child
a
daughter
lived
and
she
grew
strangely
in
stature
and
intellect
and
was
the
perfect
resemblance
of
her
who
had
departed
and
i
loved
her
with
a
love
more
fervent
than
i
had
believed
it
possible
to
feel
for
any
denizen
of
earth
but
ere
long
the
heaven
of
this
pure
affection
became
darkened
and
gloom
and
horror
and
grief
swept
over
it
in
clouds
i
said
the
child
grew
strangely
in
stature
and
intelligence
strange
indeed
was
her
rapid
increase
in
bodily
size
but
terrible
oh
terrible
were
the
tumultuous
thoughts
which
crowded
upon
me
while
watching
the
development
of
her
mental
being
could
it
be
otherwise
when
i
daily
discovered
in
the
conceptions
of
the
child
the
adult
powers
and
faculties
of
the
woman
when
the
lessons
of
experience
fell
from
the
lips
of
infancy
and
when
the
wisdom
or
the
passions
of
maturity
i
found
hourly
gleaming
from
its
full
and
speculative
eye
when
i
say
all
this
became
evident
to
my
appalled
senses
when
i
could
no
longer
hide
it
from
my
soul
nor
throw
it
off
from
those
perceptions
which
trembled
to
receive
it
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
suspicions
of
a
nature
fearful
and
exciting
crept
in
upon
my
spirit
or
that
my
thoughts
fell
back
aghast
upon
the
wild
tales
and
thrilling
theories
of
the
entombed
morella
i
snatched
from
the
scrutiny
of
the
world
a
being
whom
destiny
compelled
me
to
adore
and
in
the
rigorous
seclusion
of
my
home
watched
with
an
agonizing
anxiety
over
all
which
concerned
the
beloved
and
as
years
rolled
away
and
i
gazed
day
after
day
upon
her
holy
and
mild
and
eloquent
face
and
poured
over
her
maturing
form
day
after
day
did
i
discover
new
points
of
resemblance
in
the
child
to
her
mother
the
melancholy
and
the
dead
and
hourly
grew
darker
these
shadows
of
similitude
and
more
full
and
more
definite
and
more
perplexing
and
more
hideously
terrible
in
their
aspect
for
that
her
smile
was
like
her
motherâ€™s
i
could
bear
but
then
i
shuddered
at
its
too
perfect
identity
that
her
eyes
were
like
morellaâ€™s
i
could
endure
but
then
they
too
often
looked
down
into
the
depths
of
my
soul
with
morellaâ€™s
own
intense
and
bewildering
meaning
and
in
the
contour
of
the
high
forehead
and
in
the
ringlets
of
the
silken
hair
and
in
the
wan
fingers
which
buried
themselves
therein
and
in
the
sad
musical
tones
of
her
speech
and
above
all--oh
above
all
in
the
phrases
and
expressions
of
the
dead
on
the
lips
of
the
loved
and
the
living
i
found
food
for
consuming
thought
and
horror
for
a
worm
that
would
not
die
thus
passed
away
two
lustra
of
her
life
and
as
yet
my
daughter
remained
nameless
upon
the
earth
â€œmy
childâ€
and
â€œmy
loveâ€
were
the
designations
usually
prompted
by
a
fatherâ€™s
affection
and
the
rigid
seclusion
of
her
days
precluded
all
other
intercourse
morellaâ€™s
name
died
with
her
at
her
death
of
the
mother
i
had
never
spoken
to
the
daughter
it
was
impossible
to
speak
indeed
during
the
brief
period
of
her
existence
the
latter
had
received
no
impressions
from
the
outward
world
save
such
as
might
have
been
afforded
by
the
narrow
limits
of
her
privacy
but
at
length
the
ceremony
of
baptism
presented
to
my
mind
in
its
unnerved
and
agitated
condition
a
present
deliverance
from
the
terrors
of
my
destiny
and
at
the
baptismal
font
i
hesitated
for
a
name
and
many
titles
of
the
wise
and
beautiful
of
old
and
modern
times
of
my
own
and
foreign
lands
came
thronging
to
my
lips
with
many
many
fair
titles
of
the
gentle
and
the
happy
and
the
good
what
prompted
me
then
to
disturb
the
memory
of
the
buried
dead
what
demon
urged
me
to
breathe
that
sound
which
in
its
very
recollection
was
wont
to
make
ebb
the
purple
blood
in
torrents
from
the
temples
to
the
heart
what
fiend
spoke
from
the
recesses
of
my
soul
when
amid
those
dim
aisles
and
in
the
silence
of
the
night
i
whispered
within
the
ears
of
the
holy
man
the
syllables--morella
what
more
than
fiend
convulsed
the
features
of
my
child
and
overspread
them
with
hues
of
death
as
starting
at
that
scarcely
audible
sound
she
turned
her
glassy
eyes
from
the
earth
to
heaven
and
falling
prostrate
on
the
black
slabs
of
our
ancestral
vault
responded--â€œi
am
hereâ€
distinct
coldly
calmly
distinct
fell
those
few
simple
sounds
within
my
ear
and
thence
like
molten
lead
rolled
hissingly
into
my
brain
years--years
may
pass
away
but
the
memory
of
that
epoch
never
nor
was
i
indeed
ignorant
of
the
flowers
and
the
vine--but
the
hemlock
and
the
cypress
overshadowed
me
night
and
day
and
i
kept
no
reckoning
of
time
or
place
and
the
stars
of
my
fate
faded
from
heaven
and
therefore
the
earth
grew
dark
and
its
figures
passed
by
me
like
flitting
shadows
and
among
them
all
i
beheld
only--morella
the
winds
of
the
firmament
breathed
but
one
sound
within
my
ears
and
the
ripples
upon
the
sea
murmured
evermore--morella
but
she
died
and
with
my
own
hands
i
bore
her
to
the
tomb
and
i
laughed
with
a
long
and
bitter
laugh
as
i
found
no
traces
of
the
first
in
the
channel
where
i
laid
the
second--morella
a
tale
of
the
ragged
mountains
during
the
fall
of
the
year
1827
while
residing
near
charlottesville
virginia
i
casually
made
the
acquaintance
of
mr
augustus
bedloe
this
young
gentleman
was
remarkable
in
every
respect
and
excited
in
me
a
profound
interest
and
curiosity
i
found
it
impossible
to
comprehend
him
either
in
his
moral
or
his
physical
relations
of
his
family
i
could
obtain
no
satisfactory
account
whence
he
came
i
never
ascertained
even
about
his
age--although
i
call
him
a
young
gentleman--there
was
something
which
perplexed
me
in
no
little
degree
he
certainly
seemed
young--and
he
made
a
point
of
speaking
about
his
youth--yet
there
were
moments
when
i
should
have
had
little
trouble
in
imagining
him
a
hundred
years
of
age
but
in
no
regard
was
he
more
peculiar
than
in
his
personal
appearance
he
was
singularly
tall
and
thin
he
stooped
much
his
limbs
were
exceedingly
long
and
emaciated
his
forehead
was
broad
and
low
his
complexion
was
absolutely
bloodless
his
mouth
was
large
and
flexible
and
his
teeth
were
more
wildly
uneven
although
sound
than
i
had
ever
before
seen
teeth
in
a
human
head
the
expression
of
his
smile
however
was
by
no
means
unpleasing
as
might
be
supposed
but
it
had
no
variation
whatever
it
was
one
of
profound
melancholy--of
a
phaseless
and
unceasing
gloom
his
eyes
were
abnormally
large
and
round
like
those
of
a
cat
the
pupils
too
upon
any
accession
or
diminution
of
light
underwent
contraction
or
dilation
just
such
as
is
observed
in
the
feline
tribe
in
moments
of
excitement
the
orbs
grew
bright
to
a
degree
almost
inconceivable
seeming
to
emit
luminous
rays
not
of
a
reflected
but
of
an
intrinsic
lustre
as
does
a
candle
or
the
sun
yet
their
ordinary
condition
was
so
totally
vapid
filmy
and
dull
as
to
convey
the
idea
of
the
eyes
of
a
long-interred
corpse
these
peculiarities
of
person
appeared
to
cause
him
much
annoyance
and
he
was
continually
alluding
to
them
in
a
sort
of
half
explanatory
half
apologetic
strain
which
when
i
first
heard
it
impressed
me
very
painfully
i
soon
however
grew
accustomed
to
it
and
my
uneasiness
wore
off
it
seemed
to
be
his
design
rather
to
insinuate
than
directly
to
assert
that
physically
he
had
not
always
been
what
he
was--that
a
long
series
of
neuralgic
attacks
had
reduced
him
from
a
condition
of
more
than
usual
personal
beauty
to
that
which
i
saw
for
many
years
past
he
had
been
attended
by
a
physician
named
templeton--an
old
gentleman
perhaps
seventy
years
of
age--whom
he
had
first
encountered
at
saratoga
and
from
whose
attention
while
there
he
either
received
or
fancied
that
he
received
great
benefit
the
result
was
that
bedloe
who
was
wealthy
had
made
an
arrangement
with
dr
templeton
by
which
the
latter
in
consideration
of
a
liberal
annual
allowance
had
consented
to
devote
his
time
and
medical
experience
exclusively
to
the
care
of
the
invalid
doctor
templeton
had
been
a
traveller
in
his
younger
days
and
at
paris
had
become
a
convert
in
great
measure
to
the
doctrines
of
mesmer
it
was
altogether
by
means
of
magnetic
remedies
that
he
had
succeeded
in
alleviating
the
acute
pains
of
his
patient
and
this
success
had
very
naturally
inspired
the
latter
with
a
certain
degree
of
confidence
in
the
opinions
from
which
the
remedies
had
been
educed
the
doctor
however
like
all
enthusiasts
had
struggled
hard
to
make
a
thorough
convert
of
his
pupil
and
finally
so
far
gained
his
point
as
to
induce
the
sufferer
to
submit
to
numerous
experiments
by
a
frequent
repetition
of
these
a
result
had
arisen
which
of
late
days
has
become
so
common
as
to
attract
little
or
no
attention
but
which
at
the
period
of
which
i
write
had
very
rarely
been
known
in
america
i
mean
to
say
that
between
doctor
templeton
and
bedloe
there
had
grown
up
little
by
little
a
very
distinct
and
strongly
marked
rapport
or
magnetic
relation
i
am
not
prepared
to
assert
however
that
this
rapport
extended
beyond
the
limits
of
the
simple
sleep-producing
power
but
this
power
itself
had
attained
great
intensity
at
the
first
attempt
to
induce
the
magnetic
somnolency
the
mesmerist
entirely
failed
in
the
fifth
or
sixth
he
succeeded
very
partially
and
after
long
continued
effort
only
at
the
twelfth
was
the
triumph
complete
after
this
the
will
of
the
patient
succumbed
rapidly
to
that
of
the
physician
so
that
when
i
first
became
acquainted
with
the
two
sleep
was
brought
about
almost
instantaneously
by
the
mere
volition
of
the
operator
even
when
the
invalid
was
unaware
of
his
presence
it
is
only
now
in
the
year
1845
when
similar
miracles
are
witnessed
daily
by
thousands
that
i
dare
venture
to
record
this
apparent
impossibility
as
a
matter
of
serious
fact
the
temperature
of
bedloe
was
in
the
highest
degree
sensitive
excitable
enthusiastic
his
imagination
was
singularly
vigorous
and
creative
and
no
doubt
it
derived
additional
force
from
the
habitual
use
of
morphine
which
he
swallowed
in
great
quantity
and
without
which
he
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
exist
it
was
his
practice
to
take
a
very
large
dose
of
it
immediately
after
breakfast
each
morning--or
rather
immediately
after
a
cup
of
strong
coffee
for
he
ate
nothing
in
the
forenoon--and
then
set
forth
alone
or
attended
only
by
a
dog
upon
a
long
ramble
among
the
chain
of
wild
and
dreary
hills
that
lie
westward
and
southward
of
charlottesville
and
are
there
dignified
by
the
title
of
the
ragged
mountains
upon
a
dim
warm
misty
day
toward
the
close
of
november
and
during
the
strange
interregnum
of
the
seasons
which
in
america
is
termed
the
indian
summer
mr
bedloe
departed
as
usual
for
the
hills
the
day
passed
and
still
he
did
not
return
about
eight
oâ€™clock
at
night
having
become
seriously
alarmed
at
his
protracted
absence
we
were
about
setting
out
in
search
of
him
when
he
unexpectedly
made
his
appearance
in
health
no
worse
than
usual
and
in
rather
more
than
ordinary
spirits
the
account
which
he
gave
of
his
expedition
and
of
the
events
which
had
detained
him
was
a
singular
one
indeed
â€œyou
will
rememberâ€
said
he
â€œthat
it
was
about
nine
in
the
morning
when
i
left
charlottesville
i
bent
my
steps
immediately
to
the
mountains
and
about
ten
entered
a
gorge
which
was
entirely
new
to
me
i
followed
the
windings
of
this
pass
with
much
interest
the
scenery
which
presented
itself
on
all
sides
although
scarcely
entitled
to
be
called
grand
had
about
it
an
indescribable
and
to
me
a
delicious
aspect
of
dreary
desolation
the
solitude
seemed
absolutely
virgin
i
could
not
help
believing
that
the
green
sods
and
the
gray
rocks
upon
which
i
trod
had
been
trodden
never
before
by
the
foot
of
a
human
being
so
entirely
secluded
and
in
fact
inaccessible
except
through
a
series
of
accidents
is
the
entrance
of
the
ravine
that
it
is
by
no
means
impossible
that
i
was
indeed
the
first
adventurer--the
very
first
and
sole
adventurer
who
had
ever
penetrated
its
recesses
â€œthe
thick
and
peculiar
mist
or
smoke
which
distinguishes
the
indian
summer
and
which
now
hung
heavily
over
all
objects
served
no
doubt
to
deepen
the
vague
impressions
which
these
objects
created
so
dense
was
this
pleasant
fog
that
i
could
at
no
time
see
more
than
a
dozen
yards
of
the
path
before
me
this
path
was
excessively
sinuous
and
as
the
sun
could
not
be
seen
i
soon
lost
all
idea
of
the
direction
in
which
i
journeyed
in
the
meantime
the
morphine
had
its
customary
effect--that
of
enduing
all
the
external
world
with
an
intensity
of
interest
in
the
quivering
of
a
leaf--in
the
hue
of
a
blade
of
grass--in
the
shape
of
a
trefoil--in
the
humming
of
a
bee--in
the
gleaming
of
a
dew-drop--in
the
breathing
of
the
wind--in
the
faint
odors
that
came
from
the
forest--there
came
a
whole
universe
of
suggestion--a
gay
and
motley
train
of
rhapsodical
and
immethodical
thought
â€œbusied
in
this
i
walked
on
for
several
hours
during
which
the
mist
deepened
around
me
to
so
great
an
extent
that
at
length
i
was
reduced
to
an
absolute
groping
of
the
way
and
now
an
indescribable
uneasiness
possessed
me--a
species
of
nervous
hesitation
and
tremor
i
feared
to
tread
lest
i
should
be
precipitated
into
some
abyss
i
remembered
too
strange
stories
told
about
these
ragged
hills
and
of
the
uncouth
and
fierce
races
of
men
who
tenanted
their
groves
and
caverns
a
thousand
vague
fancies
oppressed
and
disconcerted
me--fancies
the
more
distressing
because
vague
very
suddenly
my
attention
was
arrested
by
the
loud
beating
of
a
drum
â€œmy
amazement
was
of
course
extreme
a
drum
in
these
hills
was
a
thing
unknown
i
could
not
have
been
more
surprised
at
the
sound
of
the
trump
of
the
archangel
but
a
new
and
still
more
astounding
source
of
interest
and
perplexity
arose
there
came
a
wild
rattling
or
jingling
sound
as
if
of
a
bunch
of
large
keys
and
upon
the
instant
a
dusky-visaged
and
half-naked
man
rushed
past
me
with
a
shriek
he
came
so
close
to
my
person
that
i
felt
his
hot
breath
upon
my
face
he
bore
in
one
hand
an
instrument
composed
of
an
assemblage
of
steel
rings
and
shook
them
vigorously
as
he
ran
scarcely
had
he
disappeared
in
the
mist
before
panting
after
him
with
open
mouth
and
glaring
eyes
there
darted
a
huge
beast
i
could
not
be
mistaken
in
its
character
it
was
a
hyena
â€œthe
sight
of
this
monster
rather
relieved
than
heightened
my
terrors--for
i
now
made
sure
that
i
dreamed
and
endeavored
to
arouse
myself
to
waking
consciousness
i
stepped
boldly
and
briskly
forward
i
rubbed
my
eyes
i
called
aloud
i
pinched
my
limbs
a
small
spring
of
water
presented
itself
to
my
view
and
here
stooping
i
bathed
my
hands
and
my
head
and
neck
this
seemed
to
dissipate
the
equivocal
sensations
which
had
hitherto
annoyed
me
i
arose
as
i
thought
a
new
man
and
proceeded
steadily
and
complacently
on
my
unknown
way
â€œat
length
quite
overcome
by
exertion
and
by
a
certain
oppressive
closeness
of
the
atmosphere
i
seated
myself
beneath
a
tree
presently
there
came
a
feeble
gleam
of
sunshine
and
the
shadow
of
the
leaves
of
the
tree
fell
faintly
but
definitely
upon
the
grass
at
this
shadow
i
gazed
wonderingly
for
many
minutes
its
character
stupefied
me
with
astonishment
i
looked
upward
the
tree
was
a
palm
â€œi
now
arose
hurriedly
and
in
a
state
of
fearful
agitation--for
the
fancy
that
i
dreamed
would
serve
me
no
longer
i
saw--i
felt
that
i
had
perfect
command
of
my
senses--and
these
senses
now
brought
to
my
soul
a
world
of
novel
and
singular
sensation
the
heat
became
all
at
once
intolerable
a
strange
odor
loaded
the
breeze
a
low
continuous
murmur
like
that
arising
from
a
full
but
gently
flowing
river
came
to
my
ears
intermingled
with
the
peculiar
hum
of
multitudinous
human
voices
â€œwhile
i
listened
in
an
extremity
of
astonishment
which
i
need
not
attempt
to
describe
a
strong
and
brief
gust
of
wind
bore
off
the
incumbent
fog
as
if
by
the
wand
of
an
enchanter
â€œi
found
myself
at
the
foot
of
a
high
mountain
and
looking
down
into
a
vast
plain
through
which
wound
a
majestic
river
on
the
margin
of
this
river
stood
an
eastern-looking
city
such
as
we
read
of
in
the
arabian
tales
but
of
a
character
even
more
singular
than
any
there
described
from
my
position
which
was
far
above
the
level
of
the
town
i
could
perceive
its
every
nook
and
corner
as
if
delineated
on
a
map
the
streets
seemed
innumerable
and
crossed
each
other
irregularly
in
all
directions
but
were
rather
long
winding
alleys
than
streets
and
absolutely
swarmed
with
inhabitants
the
houses
were
wildly
picturesque
on
every
hand
was
a
wilderness
of
balconies
of
verandas
of
minarets
of
shrines
and
fantastically
carved
oriels
bazaars
abounded
and
in
these
were
displayed
rich
wares
in
infinite
variety
and
profusion--silks
muslins
the
most
dazzling
cutlery
the
most
magnificent
jewels
and
gems
besides
these
things
were
seen
on
all
sides
banners
and
palanquins
litters
with
stately
dames
close
veiled
elephants
gorgeously
caparisoned
idols
grotesquely
hewn
drums
banners
and
gongs
spears
silver
and
gilded
maces
and
amid
the
crowd
and
the
clamor
and
the
general
intricacy
and
confusion--amid
the
million
of
black
and
yellow
men
turbaned
and
robed
and
of
flowing
beard
there
roamed
a
countless
multitude
of
holy
filleted
bulls
while
vast
legions
of
the
filthy
but
sacred
ape
clambered
chattering
and
shrieking
about
the
cornices
of
the
mosques
or
clung
to
the
minarets
and
oriels
from
the
swarming
streets
to
the
banks
of
the
river
there
descended
innumerable
flights
of
steps
leading
to
bathing
places
while
the
river
itself
seemed
to
force
a
passage
with
difficulty
through
the
vast
fleets
of
deeply-burthened
ships
that
far
and
wide
encountered
its
surface
beyond
the
limits
of
the
city
arose
in
frequent
majestic
groups
the
palm
and
the
cocoa
with
other
gigantic
and
weird
trees
of
vast
age
and
here
and
there
might
be
seen
a
field
of
rice
the
thatched
hut
of
a
peasant
a
tank
a
stray
temple
a
gypsy
camp
or
a
solitary
graceful
maiden
taking
her
way
with
a
pitcher
upon
her
head
to
the
banks
of
the
magnificent
river
â€œyou
will
say
now
of
course
that
i
dreamed
but
not
so
what
i
saw--what
i
heard--what
i
felt--what
i
thought--had
about
it
nothing
of
the
unmistakable
idiosyncrasy
of
the
dream
all
was
rigorously
self-consistent
at
first
doubting
that
i
was
really
awake
i
entered
into
a
series
of
tests
which
soon
convinced
me
that
i
really
was
now
when
one
dreams
and
in
the
dream
suspects
that
he
dreams
the
suspicion
never
fails
to
confirm
itself
and
the
sleeper
is
almost
immediately
aroused
thus
novalis
errs
not
in
saying
that
â€˜we
are
near
waking
when
we
dream
that
we
dreamâ€™
had
the
vision
occurred
to
me
as
i
describe
it
without
my
suspecting
it
as
a
dream
then
a
dream
it
might
absolutely
have
been
but
occurring
as
it
did
and
suspected
and
tested
as
it
was
i
am
forced
to
class
it
among
other
phenomenaâ€
â€œin
this
i
am
not
sure
that
you
are
wrongâ€
observed
dr
templeton
â€œbut
proceed
you
arose
and
descended
into
the
cityâ€
â€œi
aroseâ€
continued
bedloe
regarding
the
doctor
with
an
air
of
profound
astonishment
â€œi
arose
as
you
say
and
descended
into
the
city
on
my
way
i
fell
in
with
an
immense
populace
crowding
through
every
avenue
all
in
the
same
direction
and
exhibiting
in
every
action
the
wildest
excitement
very
suddenly
and
by
some
inconceivable
impulse
i
became
intensely
imbued
with
personal
interest
in
what
was
going
on
i
seemed
to
feel
that
i
had
an
important
part
to
play
without
exactly
understanding
what
it
was
against
the
crowd
which
environed
me
however
i
experienced
a
deep
sentiment
of
animosity
i
shrank
from
amid
them
and
swiftly
by
a
circuitous
path
reached
and
entered
the
city
here
all
was
the
wildest
tumult
and
contention
a
small
party
of
men
clad
in
garments
half-indian
half-european
and
officered
by
gentlemen
in
a
uniform
partly
british
were
engaged
at
great
odds
with
the
swarming
rabble
of
the
alleys
i
joined
the
weaker
party
arming
myself
with
the
weapons
of
a
fallen
officer
and
fighting
i
knew
not
whom
with
the
nervous
ferocity
of
despair
we
were
soon
overpowered
by
numbers
and
driven
to
seek
refuge
in
a
species
of
kiosk
here
we
barricaded
ourselves
and
for
the
present
were
secure
from
a
loop-hole
near
the
summit
of
the
kiosk
i
perceived
a
vast
crowd
in
furious
agitation
surrounding
and
assaulting
a
gay
palace
that
overhung
the
river
presently
from
an
upper
window
of
this
place
there
descended
an
effeminate-looking
person
by
means
of
a
string
made
of
the
turbans
of
his
attendants
a
boat
was
at
hand
in
which
he
escaped
to
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
â€œand
now
a
new
object
took
possession
of
my
soul
i
spoke
a
few
hurried
but
energetic
words
to
my
companions
and
having
succeeded
in
gaining
over
a
few
of
them
to
my
purpose
made
a
frantic
sally
from
the
kiosk
we
rushed
amid
the
crowd
that
surrounded
it
they
retreated
at
first
before
us
they
rallied
fought
madly
and
retreated
again
in
the
mean
time
we
were
borne
far
from
the
kiosk
and
became
bewildered
and
entangled
among
the
narrow
streets
of
tall
overhanging
houses
into
the
recesses
of
which
the
sun
had
never
been
able
to
shine
the
rabble
pressed
impetuously
upon
us
harrassing
us
with
their
spears
and
overwhelming
us
with
flights
of
arrows
these
latter
were
very
remarkable
and
resembled
in
some
respects
the
writhing
creese
of
the
malay
they
were
made
to
imitate
the
body
of
a
creeping
serpent
and
were
long
and
black
with
a
poisoned
barb
one
of
them
struck
me
upon
the
right
temple
i
reeled
and
fell
an
instantaneous
and
dreadful
sickness
seized
me
i
struggled--i
gasped--i
died
â€œyou
will
hardly
persist
nowâ€
said
i
smiling
â€œthat
the
whole
of
your
adventure
was
not
a
dream
you
are
not
prepared
to
maintain
that
you
are
deadâ€
when
i
said
these
words
i
of
course
expected
some
lively
sally
from
bedloe
in
reply
but
to
my
astonishment
he
hesitated
trembled
became
fearfully
pallid
and
remained
silent
i
looked
toward
templeton
he
sat
erect
and
rigid
in
his
chair--his
teeth
chattered
and
his
eyes
were
starting
from
their
sockets
â€œproceedâ€
he
at
length
said
hoarsely
to
bedloe
â€œfor
many
minutesâ€
continued
the
latter
â€œmy
sole
sentiment--my
sole
feeling--was
that
of
darkness
and
nonentity
with
the
consciousness
of
death
at
length
there
seemed
to
pass
a
violent
and
sudden
shock
through
my
soul
as
if
of
electricity
with
it
came
the
sense
of
elasticity
and
of
light
this
latter
i
felt--not
saw
in
an
instant
i
seemed
to
rise
from
the
ground
but
i
had
no
bodily
no
visible
audible
or
palpable
presence
the
crowd
had
departed
the
tumult
had
ceased
the
city
was
in
comparative
repose
beneath
me
lay
my
corpse
with
the
arrow
in
my
temple
the
whole
head
greatly
swollen
and
disfigured
but
all
these
things
i
felt--not
saw
i
took
interest
in
nothing
even
the
corpse
seemed
a
matter
in
which
i
had
no
concern
volition
i
had
none
but
appeared
to
be
impelled
into
motion
and
flitted
buoyantly
out
of
the
city
retracing
the
circuitous
path
by
which
i
had
entered
it
when
i
had
attained
that
point
of
the
ravine
in
the
mountains
at
which
i
had
encountered
the
hyena
i
again
experienced
a
shock
as
of
a
galvanic
battery
the
sense
of
weight
of
volition
of
substance
returned
i
became
my
original
self
and
bent
my
steps
eagerly
homeward--but
the
past
had
not
lost
the
vividness
of
the
real--and
not
now
even
for
an
instant
can
i
compel
my
understanding
to
regard
it
as
a
dreamâ€
â€œnor
was
itâ€
said
templeton
with
an
air
of
deep
solemnity
â€œyet
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
how
otherwise
it
should
be
termed
let
us
suppose
only
that
the
soul
of
the
man
of
to-day
is
upon
the
verge
of
some
stupendous
psychal
discoveries
let
us
content
ourselves
with
this
supposition
for
the
rest
i
have
some
explanation
to
make
here
is
a
watercolor
drawing
which
i
should
have
shown
you
before
but
which
an
unaccountable
sentiment
of
horror
has
hitherto
prevented
me
from
showingâ€
we
looked
at
the
picture
which
he
presented
i
saw
nothing
in
it
of
an
extraordinary
character
but
its
effect
upon
bedloe
was
prodigious
he
nearly
fainted
as
he
gazed
and
yet
it
was
but
a
miniature
portrait--a
miraculously
accurate
one
to
be
sure--of
his
own
very
remarkable
features
at
least
this
was
my
thought
as
i
regarded
it
â€œyou
will
perceiveâ€
said
templeton
â€œthe
date
of
this
picture--it
is
here
scarcely
visible
in
this
corner--1780
in
this
year
was
the
portrait
taken
it
is
the
likeness
of
a
dead
friend--a
mr
oldeb--to
whom
i
became
much
attached
at
calcutta
during
the
administration
of
warren
hastings
i
was
then
only
twenty
years
old
when
i
first
saw
you
mr
bedloe
at
saratoga
it
was
the
miraculous
similarity
which
existed
between
yourself
and
the
painting
which
induced
me
to
accost
you
to
seek
your
friendship
and
to
bring
about
those
arrangements
which
resulted
in
my
becoming
your
constant
companion
in
accomplishing
this
point
i
was
urged
partly
and
perhaps
principally
by
a
regretful
memory
of
the
deceased
but
also
in
part
by
an
uneasy
and
not
altogether
horrorless
curiosity
respecting
yourself
â€œin
your
detail
of
the
vision
which
presented
itself
to
you
amid
the
hills
you
have
described
with
the
minutest
accuracy
the
indian
city
of
benares
upon
the
holy
river
the
riots
the
combat
the
massacre
were
the
actual
events
of
the
insurrection
of
cheyte
sing
which
took
place
in
1780
when
hastings
was
put
in
imminent
peril
of
his
life
the
man
escaping
by
the
string
of
turbans
was
cheyte
sing
himself
the
party
in
the
kiosk
were
sepoys
and
british
officers
headed
by
hastings
of
this
party
i
was
one
and
did
all
i
could
to
prevent
the
rash
and
fatal
sally
of
the
officer
who
fell
in
the
crowded
alleys
by
the
poisoned
arrow
of
a
bengalee
that
officer
was
my
dearest
friend
it
was
oldeb
you
will
perceive
by
these
manuscriptsâ€
here
the
speaker
produced
a
note-book
in
which
several
pages
appeared
to
have
been
freshly
written
â€œthat
at
the
very
period
in
which
you
fancied
these
things
amid
the
hills
i
was
engaged
in
detailing
them
upon
paper
here
at
homeâ€
in
about
a
week
after
this
conversation
the
following
paragraphs
appeared
in
a
charlottesville
paper
â€œwe
have
the
painful
duty
of
announcing
the
death
of
mr
augustus
bedlo
a
gentleman
whose
amiable
manners
and
many
virtues
have
long
endeared
him
to
the
citizens
of
charlottesville
â€œmr
b
for
some
years
past
has
been
subject
to
neuralgia
which
has
often
threatened
to
terminate
fatally
but
this
can
be
regarded
only
as
the
mediate
cause
of
his
decease
the
proximate
cause
was
one
of
especial
singularity
in
an
excursion
to
the
ragged
mountains
a
few
days
since
a
slight
cold
and
fever
were
contracted
attended
with
great
determination
of
blood
to
the
head
to
relieve
this
dr
templeton
resorted
to
topical
bleeding
leeches
were
applied
to
the
temples
in
a
fearfully
brief
period
the
patient
died
when
it
appeared
that
in
the
jar
containing
the
leeches
had
been
introduced
by
accident
one
of
the
venomous
vermicular
sangsues
which
are
now
and
then
found
in
the
neighboring
ponds
this
creature
fastened
itself
upon
a
small
artery
in
the
right
temple
its
close
resemblance
to
the
medicinal
leech
caused
the
mistake
to
be
overlooked
until
too
late
â€œn
b
the
poisonous
sangsue
of
charlottesville
may
always
be
distinguished
from
the
medicinal
leech
by
its
blackness
and
especially
by
its
writhing
or
vermicular
motions
which
very
nearly
resemble
those
of
a
snakeâ€
i
was
speaking
with
the
editor
of
the
paper
in
question
upon
the
topic
of
this
remarkable
accident
when
it
occurred
to
me
to
ask
how
it
happened
that
the
name
of
the
deceased
had
been
given
as
bedlo
â€œi
presumeâ€
i
said
â€œyou
have
authority
for
this
spelling
but
i
have
always
supposed
the
name
to
be
written
with
an
e
at
the
endâ€
â€œauthority--noâ€
he
replied
â€œit
is
a
mere
typographical
error
the
name
is
bedlo
with
an
e
all
the
world
over
and
i
never
knew
it
to
be
spelt
otherwise
in
my
lifeâ€
â€œthenâ€
said
i
mutteringly
as
i
turned
upon
my
heel
â€œthen
indeed
has
it
come
to
pass
that
one
truth
is
stranger
than
any
fiction--for
bedloe
without
the
e
what
is
it
but
oldeb
conversed
and
this
man
tells
me
that
it
is
a
typographical
errorâ€
the
spectacles
many
years
ago
it
was
the
fashion
to
ridicule
the
idea
of
â€œlove
at
first
sightâ€
but
those
who
think
not
less
than
those
who
feel
deeply
have
always
advocated
its
existence
modern
discoveries
indeed
in
what
may
be
termed
ethical
magnetism
or
magnetoesthetics
render
it
probable
that
the
most
natural
and
consequently
the
truest
and
most
intense
of
the
human
affections
are
those
which
arise
in
the
heart
as
if
by
electric
sympathy--in
a
word
that
the
brightest
and
most
enduring
of
the
psychal
fetters
are
those
which
are
riveted
by
a
glance
the
confession
i
am
about
to
make
will
add
another
to
the
already
almost
innumerable
instances
of
the
truth
of
the
position
my
story
requires
that
i
should
be
somewhat
minute
i
am
still
a
very
young
man--not
yet
twenty-two
years
of
age
my
name
at
present
is
a
very
usual
and
rather
plebeian
one--simpson
i
say
â€œat
presentâ€
for
it
is
only
lately
that
i
have
been
so
called--having
legislatively
adopted
this
surname
within
the
last
year
in
order
to
receive
a
large
inheritance
left
me
by
a
distant
male
relative
adolphus
simpson
esq
the
bequest
was
conditioned
upon
my
taking
the
name
of
the
testator--the
family
not
the
christian
name
my
christian
name
is
napoleon
bonaparte--or
more
properly
these
are
my
first
and
middle
appellations
i
assumed
the
name
simpson
with
some
reluctance
as
in
my
true
patronym
froissart
i
felt
a
very
pardonable
pride--believing
that
i
could
trace
a
descent
from
the
immortal
author
of
the
â€œchroniclesâ€
while
on
the
subject
of
names
by
the
bye
i
may
mention
a
singular
coincidence
of
sound
attending
the
names
of
some
of
my
immediate
predecessors
my
father
was
a
monsieur
froissart
of
paris
his
wife--my
mother
whom
he
married
at
fifteen--was
a
mademoiselle
croissart
eldest
daughter
of
croissart
the
banker
whose
wife
again
being
only
sixteen
when
married
was
the
eldest
daughter
of
one
victor
voissart
monsieur
voissart
very
singularly
had
married
a
lady
of
similar
name--a
mademoiselle
moissart
she
too
was
quite
a
child
when
married
and
her
mother
also
madame
moissart
was
only
fourteen
when
led
to
the
altar
these
early
marriages
are
usual
in
france
here
however
are
moissart
voissart
croissart
and
froissart
all
in
the
direct
line
of
descent
my
own
name
though
as
i
say
became
simpson
by
act
of
legislature
and
with
so
much
repugnance
on
my
part
that
at
one
period
i
actually
hesitated
about
accepting
the
legacy
with
the
useless
and
annoying
proviso
attached
as
to
personal
endowments
i
am
by
no
means
deficient
on
the
contrary
i
believe
that
i
am
well
made
and
possess
what
nine
tenths
of
the
world
would
call
a
handsome
face
in
height
i
am
five
feet
eleven
my
hair
is
black
and
curling
my
nose
is
sufficiently
good
my
eyes
are
large
and
gray
and
although
in
fact
they
are
weak
a
very
inconvenient
degree
still
no
defect
in
this
regard
would
be
suspected
from
their
appearance
the
weakness
itself
however
has
always
much
annoyed
me
and
i
have
resorted
to
every
remedy--short
of
wearing
glasses
being
youthful
and
good-looking
i
naturally
dislike
these
and
have
resolutely
refused
to
employ
them
i
know
nothing
indeed
which
so
disfigures
the
countenance
of
a
young
person
or
so
impresses
every
feature
with
an
air
of
demureness
if
not
altogether
of
sanctimoniousness
and
of
age
an
eyeglass
on
the
other
hand
has
a
savor
of
downright
foppery
and
affectation
i
have
hitherto
managed
as
well
as
i
could
without
either
but
something
too
much
of
these
merely
personal
details
which
after
all
are
of
little
importance
i
will
content
myself
with
saying
in
addition
that
my
temperament
is
sanguine
rash
ardent
enthusiastic--and
that
all
my
life
i
have
been
a
devoted
admirer
of
the
women
one
night
last
winter
i
entered
a
box
at
the
p---theatre
in
company
with
a
friend
mr
talbot
it
was
an
opera
night
and
the
bills
presented
a
very
rare
attraction
so
that
the
house
was
excessively
crowded
we
were
in
time
however
to
obtain
the
front
seats
which
had
been
reserved
for
us
and
into
which
with
some
little
difficulty
we
elbowed
our
way
for
two
hours
my
companion
who
was
a
musical
fanatico
gave
his
undivided
attention
to
the
stage
and
in
the
meantime
i
amused
myself
by
observing
the
audience
which
consisted
in
chief
part
of
the
very
elite
of
the
city
having
satisfied
myself
upon
this
point
i
was
about
turning
my
eyes
to
the
prima
donna
when
they
were
arrested
and
riveted
by
a
figure
in
one
of
the
private
boxes
which
had
escaped
my
observation
if
i
live
a
thousand
years
i
can
never
forget
the
intense
emotion
with
which
i
regarded
this
figure
it
was
that
of
a
female
the
most
exquisite
i
had
ever
beheld
the
face
was
so
far
turned
toward
the
stage
that
for
some
minutes
i
could
not
obtain
a
view
of
it--but
the
form
was
divine
no
other
word
can
sufficiently
express
its
magnificent
proportion--and
even
the
term
â€œdivineâ€
seems
ridiculously
feeble
as
i
write
it
the
magic
of
a
lovely
form
in
woman--the
necromancy
of
female
gracefulness--was
always
a
power
which
i
had
found
it
impossible
to
resist
but
here
was
grace
personified
incarnate
the
beau
ideal
of
my
wildest
and
most
enthusiastic
visions
the
figure
almost
all
of
which
the
construction
of
the
box
permitted
to
be
seen
was
somewhat
above
the
medium
height
and
nearly
approached
without
positively
reaching
the
majestic
its
perfect
fullness
and
tournure
were
delicious
the
head
of
which
only
the
back
was
visible
rivalled
in
outline
that
of
the
greek
psyche
and
was
rather
displayed
than
concealed
by
an
elegant
cap
of
gaze
aerienne
which
put
me
in
mind
of
the
ventum
textilem
of
apuleius
the
right
arm
hung
over
the
balustrade
of
the
box
and
thrilled
every
nerve
of
my
frame
with
its
exquisite
symmetry
its
upper
portion
was
draperied
by
one
of
the
loose
open
sleeves
now
in
fashion
this
extended
but
little
below
the
elbow
beneath
it
was
worn
an
under
one
of
some
frail
material
close-fitting
and
terminated
by
a
cuff
of
rich
lace
which
fell
gracefully
over
the
top
of
the
hand
revealing
only
the
delicate
fingers
upon
one
of
which
sparkled
a
diamond
ring
which
i
at
once
saw
was
of
extraordinary
value
the
admirable
roundness
of
the
wrist
was
well
set
off
by
a
bracelet
which
encircled
it
and
which
also
was
ornamented
and
clasped
by
a
magnificent
aigrette
of
jewels--telling
in
words
that
could
not
be
mistaken
at
once
of
the
wealth
and
fastidious
taste
of
the
wearer
i
gazed
at
this
queenly
apparition
for
at
least
half
an
hour
as
if
i
had
been
suddenly
converted
to
stone
and
during
this
period
i
felt
the
full
force
and
truth
of
all
that
has
been
said
or
sung
concerning
â€œlove
at
first
sightâ€
my
feelings
were
totally
different
from
any
which
i
had
hitherto
experienced
in
the
presence
of
even
the
most
celebrated
specimens
of
female
loveliness
an
unaccountable
and
what
i
am
compelled
to
consider
a
magnetic
sympathy
of
soul
for
soul
seemed
to
rivet
not
only
my
vision
but
my
whole
powers
of
thought
and
feeling
upon
the
admirable
object
before
me
i
saw--i
felt--i
knew
that
i
was
deeply
madly
irrevocably
in
love--and
this
even
before
seeing
the
face
of
the
person
beloved
so
intense
indeed
was
the
passion
that
consumed
me
that
i
really
believe
it
would
have
received
little
if
any
abatement
had
the
features
yet
unseen
proved
of
merely
ordinary
character
so
anomalous
is
the
nature
of
the
only
true
love--of
the
love
at
first
sight--and
so
little
really
dependent
is
it
upon
the
external
conditions
which
only
seem
to
create
and
control
it
while
i
was
thus
wrapped
in
admiration
of
this
lovely
vision
a
sudden
disturbance
among
the
audience
caused
her
to
turn
her
head
partially
toward
me
so
that
i
beheld
the
entire
profile
of
the
face
its
beauty
even
exceeded
my
anticipations--and
yet
there
was
something
about
it
which
disappointed
me
without
my
being
able
to
tell
exactly
what
it
was
i
said
â€œdisappointedâ€
but
this
is
not
altogether
the
word
my
sentiments
were
at
once
quieted
and
exalted
they
partook
less
of
transport
and
more
of
calm
enthusiasm
of
enthusiastic
repose
this
state
of
feeling
arose
perhaps
from
the
madonna-like
and
matronly
air
of
the
face
and
yet
i
at
once
understood
that
it
could
not
have
arisen
entirely
from
this
there
was
something
else--some
mystery
which
i
could
not
develope--some
expression
about
the
countenance
which
slightly
disturbed
me
while
it
greatly
heightened
my
interest
in
fact
i
was
just
in
that
condition
of
mind
which
prepares
a
young
and
susceptible
man
for
any
act
of
extravagance
had
the
lady
been
alone
i
should
undoubtedly
have
entered
her
box
and
accosted
her
at
all
hazards
but
fortunately
she
was
attended
by
two
companions--a
gentleman
and
a
strikingly
beautiful
woman
to
all
appearance
a
few
years
younger
than
herself
i
revolved
in
my
mind
a
thousand
schemes
by
which
i
might
obtain
hereafter
an
introduction
to
the
elder
lady
or
for
the
present
at
all
events
a
more
distinct
view
of
her
beauty
i
would
have
removed
my
position
to
one
nearer
her
own
but
the
crowded
state
of
the
theatre
rendered
this
impossible
and
the
stern
decrees
of
fashion
had
of
late
imperatively
prohibited
the
use
of
the
opera-glass
in
a
case
such
as
this
even
had
i
been
so
fortunate
as
to
have
one
with
me--but
i
had
not--and
was
thus
in
despair
at
length
i
bethought
me
of
applying
to
my
companion
â€œtalbotâ€
i
said
â€œyou
have
an
opera-glass
let
me
have
itâ€
â€œan
opera-glass--no--what
do
you
suppose
i
would
be
doing
with
an
opera-glassâ€
here
he
turned
impatiently
toward
the
stage
â€œbut
talbotâ€
i
continued
pulling
him
by
the
shoulder
â€œlisten
to
me
will
you
do
you
see
the
stage--box--there--no
the
next--did
you
ever
behold
as
lovely
a
womanâ€
â€œshe
is
very
beautiful
no
doubtâ€
he
said
â€œi
wonder
who
she
can
beâ€
â€œwhy
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
angelic
donâ€™t
you
know
who
she
is
â€˜not
to
know
her
argues
yourself
unknownâ€™
she
is
the
celebrated
madame
lalande--the
beauty
of
the
day
par
excellence
and
the
talk
of
the
whole
town
immensely
wealthy
too--a
widow
and
a
great
match--has
just
arrived
from
parisâ€
â€œdo
you
know

â€œyes

the
honorâ€

â€œassuredly

it

call
upon

at

â€œvery
good
and
now
do
hold
your
tongue
if
you
canâ€
in
this
latter
respect
i
was
forced
to
take
talbotâ€™s
advice
for
he
remained
obstinately
deaf
to
every
further
question
or
suggestion
and
occupied
himself
exclusively
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
with
what
was
transacting
upon
the
stage
in
the
meantime
i
kept
my
eyes
riveted
on
madame
lalande
and
at
length
had
the
good
fortune
to
obtain
a
full
front
view
of
her
face
it
was
exquisitely
lovely--this
of
course
my
heart
had
told
me
before
even
had
not
talbot
fully
satisfied
me
upon
the
point--but
still
the
unintelligible
something
disturbed
me
i
finally
concluded
that
my
senses
were
impressed
by
a
certain
air
of
gravity
sadness
or
still
more
properly
of
weariness
which
took
something
from
the
youth
and
freshness
of
the
countenance
only
to
endow
it
with
a
seraphic
tenderness
and
majesty
and
thus
of
course
to
my
enthusiastic
and
romantic
temperment
with
an
interest
tenfold
while
i
thus
feasted
my
eyes
i
perceived
at
last
to
my
great
trepidation
by
an
almost
imperceptible
start
on
the
part
of
the
lady
that
she
had
become
suddenly
aware
of
the
intensity
of
my
gaze
still
i
was
absolutely
fascinated
and
could
not
withdraw
it
even
for
an
instant
she
turned
aside
her
face
and
again
i
saw
only
the
chiselled
contour
of
the
back
portion
of
the
head
after
some
minutes
as
if
urged
by
curiosity
to
see
if
i
was
still
looking
she
gradually
brought
her
face
again
around
and
again
encountered
my
burning
gaze
her
large
dark
eyes
fell
instantly
and
a
deep
blush
mantled
her
cheek
but
what
was
my
astonishment
at
perceiving
that
she
not
only
did
not
a
second
time
avert
her
head
but
that
she
actually
took
from
her
girdle
a
double
eyeglass--elevated
it--adjusted
it--and
then
regarded
me
through
it
intently
and
deliberately
for
the
space
of
several
minutes
had
a
thunderbolt
fallen
at
my
feet
i
could
not
have
been
more
thoroughly
astounded--astounded
only--not
offended
or
disgusted
in
the
slightest
degree
although
an
action
so
bold
in
any
other
woman
would
have
been
likely
to
offend
or
disgust
but
the
whole
thing
was
done
with
so
much
quietude--so
much
nonchalance--so
much
repose--with
so
evident
an
air
of
the
highest
breeding
in
short--that
nothing
of
mere
effrontery
was
perceptible
and
my
sole
sentiments
were
those
of
admiration
and
surprise
i
observed
that
upon
her
first
elevation
of
the
glass
she
had
seemed
satisfied
with
a
momentary
inspection
of
my
person
and
was
withdrawing
the
instrument
when
as
if
struck
by
a
second
thought
she
resumed
it
and
so
continued
to
regard
me
with
fixed
attention
for
the
space
of
several
minutes--for
five
minutes
at
the
very
least
i
am
sure
this
action
so
remarkable
in
an
american
theatre
attracted
very
general
observation
and
gave
rise
to
an
indefinite
movement
or
buzz
among
the
audience
which
for
a
moment
filled
me
with
confusion
but
produced
no
visible
effect
upon
the
countenance
of
madame
lalande
having
satisfied
her
curiosity--if
such
it
was--she
dropped
the
glass
and
quietly
gave
her
attention
again
to
the
stage
her
profile
now
being
turned
toward
myself
as
before
i
continued
to
watch
her
unremittingly
although
i
was
fully
conscious
of
my
rudeness
in
so
doing
presently
i
saw
the
head
slowly
and
slightly
change
its
position
and
soon
i
became
convinced
that
the
lady
while
pretending
to
look
at
the
stage
was
in
fact
attentively
regarding
myself
it
is
needless
to
say
what
effect
this
conduct
on
the
part
of
so
fascinating
a
woman
had
upon
my
excitable
mind
having
thus
scrutinized
me
for
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
fair
object
of
my
passion
addressed
the
gentleman
who
attended
her
and
while
she
spoke
i
saw
distinctly
by
the
glances
of
both
that
the
conversation
had
reference
to
myself
upon
its
conclusion
madame
lalande
again
turned
toward
the
stage
and
for
a
few
minutes
seemed
absorbed
in
the
performance
at
the
expiration
of
this
period
however
i
was
thrown
into
an
extremity
of
agitation
by
seeing
her
unfold
for
the
second
time
the
eye-glass
which
hung
at
her
side
fully
confront
me
as
before
and
disregarding
the
renewed
buzz
of
the
audience
survey
me
from
head
to
foot
with
the
same
miraculous
composure
which
had
previously
so
delighted
and
confounded
my
soul
this
extraordinary
behavior
by
throwing
me
into
a
perfect
fever
of
excitement--into
an
absolute
delirium
of
love--served
rather
to
embolden
than
to
disconcert
me
in
the
mad
intensity
of
my
devotion
i
forgot
everything
but
the
presence
and
the
majestic
loveliness
of
the
vision
which
confronted
my
gaze
watching
my
opportunity
when
i
thought
the
audience
were
fully
engaged
with
the
opera
i
at
length
caught
the
eyes
of
madame
lalande
and
upon
the
instant
made
a
slight
but
unmistakable
bow
she
blushed
very
deeply--then
averted
her
eyes--then
slowly
and
cautiously
looked
around
apparently
to
see
if
my
rash
action
had
been
noticed--then
leaned
over
toward
the
gentleman
who
sat
by
her
side
i
now
felt
a
burning
sense
of
the
impropriety
i
had
committed
and
expected
nothing
less
than
instant
exposure
while
a
vision
of
pistols
upon
the
morrow
floated
rapidly
and
uncomfortably
through
my
brain
i
was
greatly
and
immediately
relieved
however
when
i
saw
the
lady
merely
hand
the
gentleman
a
play-bill
without
speaking
but
the
reader
may
form
some
feeble
conception
of
my
astonishment--of
my
profound
amazement--my
delirious
bewilderment
of
heart
and
soul--when
instantly
afterward
having
again
glanced
furtively
around
she
allowed
her
bright
eyes
to
set
fully
and
steadily
upon
my
own
and
then
with
a
faint
smile
disclosing
a
bright
line
of
her
pearly
teeth
made
two
distinct
pointed
and
unequivocal
affirmative
inclinations
of
the
head
it
is
useless
of
course
to
dwell
upon
my
joy--upon
my
transport--upon
my
illimitable
ecstasy
of
heart
if
ever
man
was
mad
with
excess
of
happiness
it
was
myself
at
that
moment
i
loved
this
was
my
first
love--so
i
felt
it
to
be
it
was
love
supreme--indescribable
it
was
â€œlove
at
first
sightâ€
and
at
first
sight
too
it
had
been
appreciated
and
returned
yes
returned
how
and
why
should
i
doubt
it
for
an
instant
what
other
construction
could
i
possibly
put
upon
such
conduct
on
the
part
of
a
lady
so
beautiful--so
wealthy--evidently
so
accomplished--of
so
high
breeding--of
so
lofty
a
position
in
society--in
every
regard
so
entirely
respectable
as
i
felt
assured
was
madame
lalande
yes
she
loved
me--she
returned
the
enthusiasm
of
my
love
with
an
enthusiasm
as
blind--as
uncompromising--as
uncalculating--as
abandoned--and
as
utterly
unbounded
as
my
own
these
delicious
fancies
and
reflections
however
were
now
interrupted
by
the
falling
of
the
drop-curtain
the
audience
arose
and
the
usual
tumult
immediately
supervened
quitting
talbot
abruptly
i
made
every
effort
to
force
my
way
into
closer
proximity
with
madame
lalande
having
failed
in
this
on
account
of
the
crowd
i
at
length
gave
up
the
chase
and
bent
my
steps
homeward
consoling
myself
for
my
disappointment
in
not
having
been
able
to
touch
even
the
hem
of
her
robe
by
the
reflection
that
i
should
be
introduced
by
talbot
in
due
form
upon
the
morrow
this
morrow
at
last
came
that
is
to
say
a
day
finally
dawned
upon
a
long
and
weary
night
of
impatience
and
then
the
hours
until
â€œoneâ€
were
snail-paced
dreary
and
innumerable
but
even
stamboul
it
is
said
shall
have
an
end
and
there
came
an
end
to
this
long
delay
the
clock
struck
as
the
last
echo
ceased
i
stepped
into
b--â€˜s
and
inquired
for
talbot
â€œoutâ€
said
the
footman--talbotâ€™s
own
â€œoutâ€
i
replied
staggering
back
half
a
dozen
paces--â€œlet
me
tell
you
my
fine
fellow
that
this
thing
is
thoroughly
impossible
and
impracticable
mr
talbot
is
not
out
what
do
you
meanâ€
â€œnothing
sir
only
mr
talbot
is
not
in
thatâ€™s
all
he
rode
over
to
s--
immediately
after
breakfast
and
left
word
that
he
would
not
be
in
town
again
for
a
weekâ€
i
stood
petrified
with
horror
and
rage
i
endeavored
to
reply
but
my
tongue
refused
its
office
at
length
i
turned
on
my
heel
livid
with
wrath
and
inwardly
consigning
the
whole
tribe
of
the
talbots
to
the
innermost
regions
of
erebus
it
was
evident
that
my
considerate
friend
il
fanatico
had
quite
forgotten
his
appointment
with
myself--had
forgotten
it
as
soon
as
it
was
made
at
no
time
was
he
a
very
scrupulous
man
of
his
word
there
was
no
help
for
it
so
smothering
my
vexation
as
well
as
i
could
i
strolled
moodily
up
the
street
propounding
futile
inquiries
about
madame
lalande
to
every
male
acquaintance
i
met
by
report
she
was
known
i
found
to
all--to
many
by
sight--but
she
had
been
in
town
only
a
few
weeks
and
there
were
very
few
therefore
who
claimed
her
personal
acquaintance
these
few
being
still
comparatively
strangers
could
not
or
would
not
take
the
liberty
of
introducing
me
through
the
formality
of
a
morning
call
while
i
stood
thus
in
despair
conversing
with
a
trio
of
friends
upon
the
all
absorbing
subject
of
my
heart
it
so
happened
that
the
subject
itself
passed
by
â€œas
i
live
there
she
isâ€
cried
one
â€œsurprisingly
beautifulâ€
exclaimed
a
second
â€œan
angel
upon
earthâ€
ejaculated
a
third
i
looked
and
in
an
open
carriage
which
approached
us
passing
slowly
down
the
street
sat
the
enchanting
vision
of
the
opera
accompanied
by
the
younger
lady
who
had
occupied
a
portion
of
her
box
â€œher
companion
also
wears
remarkably
wellâ€
said
the
one
of
my
trio
who
had
spoken
first
â€œastonishinglyâ€
said
the
second
â€œstill
quite
a
brilliant
air
but
art
will
do
wonders
upon
my
word
she
looks
better
than
she
did
at
paris
five
years
ago
a
beautiful
woman
still--donâ€™t
you
think
so
froissart--simpson
i
meanâ€
â€œstillâ€
said
i
â€œand
why
shouldnâ€™t
she
be
but
compared
with
her
friend
she
is
as
a
rush-light
to
the
evening
star--a
glow-worm
to
antares
â€œha
ha
ha--why
simpson
you
have
an
astonishing
tact
at
making
discoveries--original
ones
i
meanâ€
and
here
we
separated
while
one
of
the
trio
began
humming
a
gay
vaudeville
of
which
i
caught
only
the
lines--
ninon
ninon
ninon
a
bas--
a
bas
ninon
de
lâ€™enclos
during
this
little
scene
however
one
thing
had
served
greatly
to
console
me
although
it
fed
the
passion
by
which
i
was
consumed
as
the
carriage
of
madame
lalande
rolled
by
our
group
i
had
observed
that
she
recognized
me
and
more
than
this
she
had
blessed
me
by
the
most
seraphic
of
all
imaginable
smiles
with
no
equivocal
mark
of
the
recognition
as
for
an
introduction
i
was
obliged
to
abandon
all
hope
of
it
until
such
time
as
talbot
should
think
proper
to
return
from
the
country
in
the
meantime
i
perseveringly
frequented
every
reputable
place
of
public
amusement
and
at
length
at
the
theatre
where
i
first
saw
her
i
had
the
supreme
bliss
of
meeting
her
and
of
exchanging
glances
with
her
once
again
this
did
not
occur
however
until
the
lapse
of
a
fortnight
every
day
in
the
interim
i
had
inquired
for
talbot
at
his
hotel
and
every
day
had
been
thrown
into
a
spasm
of
wrath
by
the
everlasting
â€œnot
come
home
yetâ€
of
his
footman
upon
the
evening
in
question
therefore
i
was
in
a
condition
little
short
of
madness
madame
lalande
i
had
been
told
was
a
parisian--had
lately
arrived
from
paris--might
she
not
suddenly
return--return
before
talbot
came
back--and
might
she
not
be
thus
lost
to
me
forever
the
thought
was
too
terrible
to
bear
since
my
future
happiness
was
at
issue
i
resolved
to
act
with
a
manly
decision
in
a
word
upon
the
breaking
up
of
the
play
i
traced
the
lady
to
her
residence
noted
the
address
and
the
next
morning
sent
her
a
full
and
elaborate
letter
in
which
i
poured
out
my
whole
heart
i
spoke
boldly
freely--in
a
word
i
spoke
with
passion
i
concealed
nothing--nothing
even
of
my
weakness
i
alluded
to
the
romantic
circumstances
of
our
first
meeting--even
to
the
glances
which
had
passed
between
us
i
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
i
felt
assured
of
her
love
while
i
offered
this
assurance
and
my
own
intensity
of
devotion
as
two
excuses
for
my
otherwise
unpardonable
conduct
as
a
third
i
spoke
of
my
fear
that
she
might
quit
the
city
before
i
could
have
the
opportunity
of
a
formal
introduction
i
concluded
the
most
wildly
enthusiastic
epistle
ever
penned
with
a
frank
declaration
of
my
worldly
circumstances--of
my
affluence--and
with
an
offer
of
my
heart
and
of
my
hand
in
an
agony
of
expectation
i
awaited
the
reply
after
what
seemed
the
lapse
of
a
century
it
came
yes
actually
came
romantic
as
all
this
may
appear
i
really
received
a
letter
from
madame
lalande--the
beautiful
the
wealthy
the
idolized
madame
lalande
her
eyes--her
magnificent
eyes
had
not
belied
her
noble
heart
like
a
true
frenchwoman
as
she
was
she
had
obeyed
the
frank
dictates
of
her
reason--the
generous
impulses
of
her
nature--despising
the
conventional
pruderies
of
the
world
she
had
not
scorned
my
proposals
she
had
not
sheltered
herself
in
silence
she
had
not
returned
my
letter
unopened
she
had
even
sent
me
in
reply
one
penned
by
her
own
exquisite
fingers
it
ran
thus
â€œmonsieur
simpson
vill
pardonne
me
for
not
compose
de
butefulle
tong
of
his
contree
so
vell
as
might
it
is
only
de
late
dat
i
am

and
not
yet
ave

opportunite
for
to--lâ€™etudier
â€œvid
dis
apologie
for
the
maniere
i
vill
now
say
dat
helas--monsieur
simpson
ave
guess
but
de
too
true
need
i
say
de
more
helas
am
i
not
ready
speak
de
too
moshe
â€œeugenie
lalandâ€
this
noble--spirited
note
i
kissed
a
million
times
and
committed
no
doubt
on
its
account
a
thousand
other
extravagances
that
have
now
escaped
my
memory
still
talbot
would
not
return
alas
could
he
have
formed
even
the
vaguest
idea
of
the
suffering
his
absence
had
occasioned
his
friend
would
not
his
sympathizing
nature
have
flown
immediately
to
my
relief
still
however
he
came
not
i
wrote
he
replied
he
was
detained
by
urgent
business--but
would
shortly
return
he
begged
me
not
to
be
impatient--to
moderate
my
transports--to
read
soothing
books--to
drink
nothing
stronger
than
hock--and
to
bring
the
consolations
of
philosophy
to
my
aid
the
fool
if
he
could
not
come
himself
why
in
the
name
of
every
thing
rational
could
he
not
have
enclosed
me
a
letter
of
presentation
i
wrote
him
again
entreating
him
to
forward
one
forthwith
my
letter
was
returned
by
that
footman
with
the
following
endorsement
in
pencil
the
scoundrel
had
joined
his
master
in
the
country
â€œleft
s---yesterday
for
parts
unknown--did
not
say
where--or
when
be
back--so
thought
best
to
return
letter
knowing
your
handwriting
and
as
how
you
is
always
more
or
less
in
a
hurry
â€œyours
sincerely
â€œstubbsâ€
after
this
it
is
needless
to
say
that
i
devoted
to
the
infernal
deities
both
master
and
valet--but
there
was
little
use
in
anger
and
no
consolation
at
all
in
complaint
but
i
had
yet
a
resource
left
in
my
constitutional
audacity
hitherto
it
had
served
me
well
and
i
now
resolved
to
make
it
avail
me
to
the
end
besides
after
the
correspondence
which
had
passed
between
us
what
act
of
mere
informality
could
i
commit
within
bounds
that
ought
to
be
regarded
as
indecorous
by
madame
lalande
since
the
affair
of
the
letter
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
watching
her
house
and
thus
discovered
that
about
twilight
it
was
her
custom
to
promenade
attended
only
by
a
negro
in
livery
in
a
public
square
overlooked
by
her
windows
here
amid
the
luxuriant
and
shadowing
groves
in
the
gray
gloom
of
a
sweet
midsummer
evening
i
observed
my
opportunity
and
accosted
her
the
better
to
deceive
the
servant
in
attendance
i
did
this
with
the
assured
air
of
an
old
and
familiar
acquaintance
with
a
presence
of
mind
truly
parisian
she
took
the
cue
at
once
and
to
greet
me
held
out
the
most
bewitchingly
little
of
hands
the
valet
at
once
fell
into
the
rear
and
now
with
hearts
full
to
overflowing
we
discoursed
long
and
unreservedly
of
our
love
as
madame
lalande
spoke
english
even
less
fluently
than
she
wrote
it
our
conversation
was
necessarily
in
french
in
this
sweet
tongue
so
adapted
to
passion
i
gave
loose
to
the
impetuous
enthusiasm
of
my
nature
and
with
all
the
eloquence
i
could
command
besought
her
to
consent
to
an
immediate
marriage
at
this
impatience
she
smiled
she
urged
the
old
story
of
decorum--that
bug-bear
which
deters
so
many
from
bliss
until
the
opportunity
for
bliss
has
forever
gone
by
i
had
most
imprudently
made
it
known
among
my
friends
she
observed
that
i
desired
her
acquaintance--thus
that
i
did
not
possess
it--thus
again
there
was
no
possibility
of
concealing
the
date
of
our
first
knowledge
of
each
other
and
then
she
adverted
with
a
blush
to
the
extreme
recency
of
this
date
to
wed
immediately
would
be
improper--would
be
indecorous--would
be
outre
all
this
she
said
with
a
charming
air
of
naivete
which
enraptured
while
it
grieved
and
convinced
me
she
went
even
so
far
as
to
accuse
me
laughingly
of
rashness--of
imprudence
she
bade
me
remember
that
i
really
even
knew
not
who
she
was--what
were
her
prospects
her
connections
her
standing
in
society
she
begged
me
but
with
a
sigh
to
reconsider
my
proposal
and
termed
my
love
an
infatuation--a
will
oâ€™
the
wisp--a
fancy
or
fantasy
of
the
moment--a
baseless
and
unstable
creation
rather
of
the
imagination
than
of
the
heart
these
things
she
uttered
as
the
shadows
of
the
sweet
twilight
gathered
darkly
and
more
darkly
around
us--and
then
with
a
gentle
pressure
of
her
fairy-like
hand
overthrew
in
a
single
sweet
instant
all
the
argumentative
fabric
she
had
reared
i
replied
as
best
i
could--as
only
a
true
lover
can
i
spoke
at
length
and
perseveringly
of
my
devotion
of
my
passion--of
her
exceeding
beauty
and
of
my
own
enthusiastic
admiration
in
conclusion
i
dwelt
with
a
convincing
energy
upon
the
perils
that
encompass
the
course
of
love--that
course
of
true
love
that
never
did
run
smooth--and
thus
deduced
the
manifest
danger
of
rendering
that
course
unnecessarily
long
this
latter
argument
seemed
finally
to
soften
the
rigor
of
her
determination
she
relented
but
there
was
yet
an
obstacle
she
said
which
she
felt
assured
i
had
not
properly
considered
this
was
a
delicate
point--for
a
woman
to
urge
especially
so
in
mentioning
it
she
saw
that
she
must
make
a
sacrifice
of
her
feelings
still
for
me
every
sacrifice
should
be
made
she
alluded
to
the
topic
of
age
was
i
aware--was
i
fully
aware
of
the
discrepancy
between
us
that
the
age
of
the
husband
should
surpass
by
a
few
years--even
by
fifteen
or
twenty--the
age
of
the
wife
was
regarded
by
the
world
as
admissible
and
indeed
as
even
proper
but
she
had
always
entertained
the
belief
that
the
years
of
the
wife
should
never
exceed
in
number
those
of
the
husband
a
discrepancy
of
this
unnatural
kind
gave
rise
too
frequently
alas
to
a
life
of
unhappiness
now
she
was
aware
that
my
own
age
did
not
exceed
two
and
twenty
and
i
on
the
contrary
perhaps
was
not
aware
that
the
years
of
my
eugenie
extended
very
considerably
beyond
that
sum
about
all
this
there
was
a
nobility
of
soul--a
dignity
of
candor--which
delighted--which
enchanted
me--which
eternally
riveted
my
chains
i
could
scarcely
restrain
the
excessive
transport
which
possessed
me
â€œmy
sweetest
eugenieâ€
i
cried
â€œwhat
is
all
this
about
which
you
are
discoursing
your
years
surpass
in
some
measure
my
own
but
what
then
the
customs
of
the
world
are
so
many
conventional
follies
to
those
who
love
as
ourselves
in
what
respect
differs
a
year
from
an
hour
i
am
twenty-two
you
say
granted
indeed
you
may
as
well
call
me
at
once
twenty-three
now
you
yourself
my
dearest
eugenie
can
have
numbered
no
more
than--can
have
numbered
no
more
than--no
more
than--than--than--than--â€
here
i
paused
for
an
instant
in
the
expectation
that
madame
lalande
would
interrupt
me
by
supplying
her
true
age
but
a
frenchwoman
is
seldom
direct
and
has
always
by
way
of
answer
to
an
embarrassing
query
some
little
practical
reply
of
her
own
in
the
present
instance
eugenie
who
for
a
few
moments
past
had
seemed
to
be
searching
for
something
in
her
bosom
at
length
let
fall
upon
the
grass
a
miniature
which
i
immediately
picked
up
and
presented
to
her
â€œkeep
itâ€
she
said
with
one
of
her
most
ravishing
smiles
â€œkeep
it
for
my
sake--for
the
sake
of
her
whom
it
too
flatteringly
represents
besides
upon
the
back
of
the
trinket
you
may
discover
perhaps
the
very
information
you
seem
to
desire
it
is
now
to
be
sure
growing
rather
dark--but
you
can
examine
it
at
your
leisure
in
the
morning
in
the
meantime
you
shall
be
my
escort
home
to-night
my
friends
are
about
holding
a
little
musical
levee
i
can
promise
you
too
some
good
singing
we
french
are
not
nearly
so
punctilious
as
you
americans
and
i
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
smuggling
you
in
in
the
character
of
an
old
acquaintanceâ€
with
this
she
took
my
arm
and
i
attended
her
home
the
mansion
was
quite
a
fine
one
and
i
believe
furnished
in
good
taste
of
this
latter
point
however
i
am
scarcely
qualified
to
judge
for
it
was
just
dark
as
we
arrived
and
in
american
mansions
of
the
better
sort
lights
seldom
during
the
heat
of
summer
make
their
appearance
at
this
the
most
pleasant
period
of
the
day
in
about
an
hour
after
my
arrival
to
be
sure
a
single
shaded
solar
lamp
was
lit
in
the
principal
drawing-room
and
this
apartment
i
could
thus
see
was
arranged
with
unusual
good
taste
and
even
splendor
but
two
other
rooms
of
the
suite
and
in
which
the
company
chiefly
assembled
remained
during
the
whole
evening
in
a
very
agreeable
shadow
this
is
a
well-conceived
custom
giving
the
party
at
least
a
choice
of
light
or
shade
and
one
which
our
friends
over
the
water
could
not
do
better
than
immediately
adopt
the
evening
thus
spent
was
unquestionably
the
most
delicious
of
my
life
madame
lalande
had
not
overrated
the
musical
abilities
of
her
friends
and
the
singing
i
here
heard
i
had
never
heard
excelled
in
any
private
circle
out
of
vienna
the
instrumental
performers
were
many
and
of
superior
talents
the
vocalists
were
chiefly
ladies
and
no
individual
sang
less
than
well
at
length
upon
a
peremptory
call
for
â€œmadame
lalandeâ€
she
arose
at
once
without
affectation
or
demur
from
the
chaise
longue
upon
which
she
had
sat
by
my
side
and
accompanied
by
one
or
two
gentlemen
and
her
female
friend
of
the
opera
repaired
to
the
piano
in
the
main
drawing-room
i
would
have
escorted
her
myself
but
felt
that
under
the
circumstances
of
my
introduction
to
the
house
i
had
better
remain
unobserved
where
i
was
i
was
thus
deprived
of
the
pleasure
of
seeing
although
not
of
hearing
her
sing
the
impression
she
produced
upon
the
company
seemed
electrical
but
the
effect
upon
myself
was
something
even
more
i
know
not
how
adequately
to
describe
it
it
arose
in
part
no
doubt
from
the
sentiment
of
love
with
which
i
was
imbued
but
chiefly
from
my
conviction
of
the
extreme
sensibility
of
the
singer
it
is
beyond
the
reach
of
art
to
endow
either
air
or
recitative
with
more
impassioned
expression
than
was
hers
her
utterance
of
the
romance
in
otello--the
tone
with
which
she
gave
the
words
â€œsul
mio
sassoâ€
in
the
capuletti--is
ringing
in
my
memory
yet
her
lower
tones
were
absolutely
miraculous
her
voice
embraced
three
complete
octaves
extending
from
the
contralto
d
to
the
d
upper
soprano
and
though
sufficiently
powerful
to
have
filled
the
san
carlos
executed
with
the
minutest
precision
every
difficulty
of
vocal
composition--ascending
and
descending
scales
cadences
or
fiorituri
in
the
final
of
the
somnambula
she
brought
about
a
most
remarkable
effect
at
the
words
ah
non
guinge
uman
pensiero
al
contento
ond
â€˜io
son
piena
here
in
imitation
of
malibran
she
modified
the
original
phrase
of
bellini
so
as
to
let
her
voice
descend
to
the
tenor
g
when
by
a
rapid
transition
she
struck
the
g
above
the
treble
stave
springing
over
an
interval
of
two
octaves
upon
rising
from
the
piano
after
these
miracles
of
vocal
execution
she
resumed
her
seat
by
my
side
when
i
expressed
to
her
in
terms
of
the
deepest
enthusiasm
my
delight
at
her
performance
of
my
surprise
i
said
nothing
and
yet
was
i
most
unfeignedly
surprised
for
a
certain
feebleness
or
rather
a
certain
tremulous
indecision
of
voice
in
ordinary
conversation
had
prepared
me
to
anticipate
that
in
singing
she
would
not
acquit
herself
with
any
remarkable
ability
our
conversation
was
now
long
earnest
uninterrupted
and
totally
unreserved
she
made
me
relate
many
of
the
earlier
passages
of
my
life
and
listened
with
breathless
attention
to
every
word
of
the
narrative
i
concealed
nothing--felt
that
i
had
a
right
to
conceal
nothing--from
her
confiding
affection
encouraged
by
her
candor
upon
the
delicate
point
of
her
age
i
entered
with
perfect
frankness
not
only
into
a
detail
of
my
many
minor
vices
but
made
full
confession
of
those
moral
and
even
of
those
physical
infirmities
the
disclosure
of
which
in
demanding
so
much
higher
a
degree
of
courage
is
so
much
surer
an
evidence
of
love
i
touched
upon
my
college
indiscretions--upon
my
extravagances--upon
my
carousals--upon
my
debts--upon
my
flirtations
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
speak
of
a
slightly
hectic
cough
with
which
at
one
time
i
had
been
troubled--of
a
chronic
rheumatism--of
a
twinge
of
hereditary
gout--and
in
conclusion
of
the
disagreeable
and
inconvenient
but
hitherto
carefully
concealed
weakness
of
my
eyes
â€œupon
this
latter
pointâ€
said
madame
lalande
laughingly
â€œyou
have
been
surely
injudicious
in
coming
to
confession
for
without
the
confession
i
take
it
for
granted
that
no
one
would
have
accused
you
of
the
crime
by
the
byâ€
she
continued
â€œhave
you
any
recollection--â€
and
here
i
fancied
that
a
blush
even
through
the
gloom
of
the
apartment
became
distinctly
visible
upon
her
cheek--â€œhave
you
any
recollection
mon
cher
ami
of
this
little
ocular
assistant
which
now
depends
from
my
neckâ€
as
she
spoke
she
twirled
in
her
fingers
the
identical
double
eye-glass
which
had
so
overwhelmed
me
with
confusion
at
the
opera
â€œfull
well--alas
do
i
remember
itâ€
i
exclaimed
pressing
passionately
the
delicate
hand
which
offered
the
glasses
for
my
inspection
they
formed
a
complex
and
magnificent
toy
richly
chased
and
filigreed
and
gleaming
with
jewels
which
even
in
the
deficient
light
i
could
not
help
perceiving
were
of
high
value
â€œeh
bien
mon
amiâ€
she
resumed
with
a
certain
empressment
of
manner
that
rather
surprised
me--â€œeh
bien
mon
ami
you
have
earnestly
besought
of
me
a
favor
which
you
have
been
pleased
to
denominate
priceless
you
have
demanded
of
me
my
hand
upon
the
morrow
should
i
yield
to
your
entreaties--and
i
may
add
to
the
pleadings
of
my
own
bosom--would
i
not
be
entitled
to
demand
of
you
a
very--a
very
little
boon
in
returnâ€
â€œname
itâ€
i
exclaimed
with
an
energy
that
had
nearly
drawn
upon
us
the
observation
of
the
company
and
restrained
by
their
presence
alone
from
throwing
myself
impetuously
at
her
feet
â€œname
it
my
beloved
my
eugenie
my
own--name
it--but
alas
it
is
already
yielded
ere
namedâ€
â€œyou
shall
conquer
then
mon
amiâ€
said
she
â€œfor
the
sake
of
the
eugenie
whom
you
love
this
little
weakness
which
you
have
at
last
confessed--this
weakness
more
moral
than
physical--and
which
let
me
assure
you
is
so
unbecoming
the
nobility
of
your
real
nature--so
inconsistent
with
the
candor
of
your
usual
character--and
which
if
permitted
further
control
will
assuredly
involve
you
sooner
or
later
in
some
very
disagreeable
scrape
you
shall
conquer
for
my
sake
this
affectation
which
leads
you
as
you
yourself
acknowledge
to
the
tacit
or
implied
denial
of
your
infirmity
of
vision
for
this
infirmity
you
virtually
deny
in
refusing
to
employ
the
customary
means
for
its
relief
you
will
understand
me
to
say
then
that
i
wish
you
to
wear
spectacles--ah
hush--you
have
already
consented
to
wear
them
for
my
sake
you
shall
accept
the
little
toy
which
i
now
hold
in
my
hand
and
which
though
admirable
as
an
aid
to
vision
is
really
of
no
very
immense
value
as
a
gem
you
perceive
that
by
a
trifling
modification
thus--or
thus--it
can
be
adapted
to
the
eyes
in
the
form
of
spectacles
or
worn
in
the
waistcoat
pocket
as
an
eye-glass
it
is
in
the
former
mode
however
and
habitually
that
you
have
already
consented
to
wear
it
for
my
sakeâ€
this
request--must
i
confess
it--confused
me
in
no
little
degree
but
the
condition
with
which
it
was
coupled
rendered
hesitation
of
course
a
matter
altogether
out
of
the
question
â€œit
is
doneâ€
i
cried
with
all
the
enthusiasm
that
i
could
muster
at
the
moment
â€œit
is
done--it
is
most
cheerfully
agreed
i
sacrifice
every
feeling
for
your
sake
to-night
i
wear
this
dear
eye-glass
as
an
eye-glass
and
upon
my
heart
but
with
the
earliest
dawn
of
that
morning
which
gives
me
the
pleasure
of
calling
you
wife
i
will
place
it
upon
my--upon
my
nose--and
there
wear
it
ever
afterward
in
the
less
romantic
and
less
fashionable
but
certainly
in
the
more
serviceable
form
which
you
desireâ€
our
conversation
now
turned
upon
the
details
of
our
arrangements
for
the
morrow
talbot
i
learned
from
my
betrothed
had
just
arrived
in
town
i
was
to
see
him
at
once
and
procure
a
carriage
the
soiree
would
scarcely
break
up
before
two
and
by
this
hour
the
vehicle
was
to
be
at
the
door
when
in
the
confusion
occasioned
by
the
departure
of
the
company
madame
l
could
easily
enter
it
unobserved
we
were
then
to
call
at
the
house
of
a
clergyman
who
would
be
in
waiting
there
be
married
drop
talbot
and
proceed
on
a
short
tour
to
the
east
leaving
the
fashionable
world
at
home
to
make
whatever
comments
upon
the
matter
it
thought
best
having
planned
all
this
i
immediately
took
leave
and
went
in
search
of
talbot
but
on
the
way
i
could
not
refrain
from
stepping
into
a
hotel
for
the
purpose
of
inspecting
the
miniature
and
this
i
did
by
the
powerful
aid
of
the
glasses
the
countenance
was
a
surpassingly
beautiful
one
those
large
luminous
eyes--that
proud
grecian
nose--those
dark
luxuriant
curls--â€œahâ€
said
i
exultingly
to
myself
â€œthis
is
indeed
the
speaking
image
of
my
belovedâ€
i
turned
the
reverse
and
discovered
the
words--â€œeugenie
lalande--aged
twenty-seven
years
and
seven
monthsâ€
i
found
talbot
at
home
and
proceeded
at
once
to
acquaint
him
with
my
good
fortune
he
professed
excessive
astonishment
of
course
but
congratulated
me
most
cordially
and
proffered
every
assistance
in
his
power
in
a
word
we
carried
out
our
arrangement
to
the
letter
and
at
two
in
the
morning
just
ten
minutes
after
the
ceremony
i
found
myself
in
a
close
carriage
with
madame
lalande--with
mrs
simpson
i
should
say--and
driving
at
a
great
rate
out
of
town
in
a
direction
northeast
by
north
half-north
it
had
been
determined
for
us
by
talbot
that
as
we
were
to
be
up
all
night
we
should
make
our
first
stop
at
c--
a
village
about
twenty
miles
from
the
city
and
there
get
an
early
breakfast
and
some
repose
before
proceeding
upon
our
route
at
four
precisely
therefore
the
carriage
drew
up
at
the
door
of
the
principal
inn
i
handed
my
adored
wife
out
and
ordered
breakfast
forthwith
in
the
meantime
we
were
shown
into
a
small
parlor
and
sat
down
it
was
now
nearly
if
not
altogether
daylight
and
as
i
gazed
enraptured
at
the
angel
by
my
side
the
singular
idea
came
all
at
once
into
my
head
that
this
was
really
the
very
first
moment
since
my
acquaintance
with
the
celebrated
loveliness
of
madame
lalande
that
i
had
enjoyed
a
near
inspection
of
that
loveliness
by
daylight
at
all
â€œand
now
mon
amiâ€
said
she
taking
my
hand
and
so
interrupting
this
train
of
reflection
â€œand
now
mon
cher
ami
since
we
are
indissolubly
one--since
i
have
yielded
to
your
passionate
entreaties
and
performed
my
portion
of
our
agreement--i
presume
you
have
not
forgotten
that
you
also
have
a
little
favor
to
bestow--a
little
promise
which
it
is
your
intention
to
keep
ah
let
me
see
let
me
remember
yes
full
easily
do
i
call
to
mind
the
precise
words
of
the
dear
promise
you
made
to
eugenie
last
night
listen
you
spoke
thus
â€˜it
is
done--it
is
most
cheerfully
agreed
i
sacrifice
every
feeling
for
your
sake
to-night
i
wear
this
dear
eye-glass
as
an
eye-glass
and
upon
my
heart
but
with
the
earliest
dawn
of
that
morning
which
gives
me
the
privilege
of
calling
you
wife
i
will
place
it
upon
my--upon
my
nose--and
there
wear
it
ever
afterward
in
the
less
romantic
and
less
fashionable
but
certainly
in
the
more
serviceable
form
which
you
desireâ€™
these
were
the
exact
words
my
beloved
husband
were
they
notâ€
â€œthey
wereâ€
i
said
â€œyou
have
an
excellent
memory
and
assuredly
my
beautiful
eugenie
there
is
no
disposition
on
my
part
to
evade
the
performance
of
the
trivial
promise
they
imply
see
behold
they
are
becoming--rather--are
they
notâ€
and
here
having
arranged
the
glasses
in
the
ordinary
form
of
spectacles
i
applied
them
gingerly
in
their
proper
position
while
madame
simpson
adjusting
her
cap
and
folding
her
arms
sat
bolt
upright
in
her
chair
in
a
somewhat
stiff
and
prim
and
indeed
in
a
somewhat
undignified
position
â€œgoodness
gracious
meâ€
i
exclaimed
almost
at
the
very
instant
that
the
rim
of
the
spectacles
had
settled
upon
my
nose--â€œmy
goodness
gracious
me--why
what
can
be
the
matter
with
these
glassesâ€
and
taking
them
quickly
off
i
wiped
them
carefully
with
a
silk
handkerchief
and
adjusted
them
again
but
if
in
the
first
instance
there
had
occurred
something
which
occasioned
me
surprise
in
the
second
this
surprise
became
elevated
into
astonishment
and
this
astonishment
was
profound--was
extreme--indeed
i
may
say
it
was
horrific
what
in
the
name
of
everything
hideous
did
this
mean
could
i
believe
my
eyes--could
i--that
was
the
question
was
that--was
that--was
that
rouge
and
were
those--and
were
those--were
those
wrinkles
upon
the
visage
of
eugenie
lalande
and
oh
jupiter
and
every
one
of
the
gods
and
goddesses
little
and
big
what--what--what--what
had
become
of
her
teeth
i
dashed
the
spectacles
violently
to
the
ground
and
leaping
to
my
feet
stood
erect
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
confronting
mrs
simpson
with
my
arms
set
a-kimbo
and
grinning
and
foaming
but
at
the
same
time
utterly
speechless
with
terror
and
with
rage
now
i
have
already
said
that
madame
eugenie
lalande--that
is
to
say
simpson--spoke
the
english
language
but
very
little
better
than
she
wrote
it
and
for
this
reason
she
very
properly
never
attempted
to
speak
it
upon
ordinary
occasions
but
rage
will
carry
a
lady
to
any
extreme
and
in
the
present
care
it
carried
mrs
simpson
to
the
very
extraordinary
extreme
of
attempting
to
hold
a
conversation
in
a
tongue
that
she
did
not
altogether
understand
â€œvell
monsieurâ€
said
she
after
surveying
me
in
great
apparent
astonishment
for
some
moments--â€œvell

â€œwhy

and

and

â€œyesâ€
she
replied
leaning
fully
back
in
her
chair
and
stretching
out
her
lower
limbs
at
great
length
â€œyes

either
the
length
or
the
nature
of
this
speech
had
the
effect
of
working
up
mrs
simpson
into
a
very
extraordinary
passion
indeed
and
as
she
made
an
end
of
it
with
great
labor
she
lumped
up
from
her
chair
like
somebody
bewitched
dropping
upon
the
floor
an
entire
universe
of
bustle
as
she
lumped
once
upon
her
feet
she
gnashed
her
gums
brandished
her
arms
rolled
up
her
sleeves
shook
her
fist
in
my
face
and
concluded
the
performance
by
tearing
the
cap
from
her
head
and
with
it
an
immense
wig
of
the
most
valuable
and
beautiful
black
hair
the
whole
of
which
she
dashed
upon
the
ground
with
a
yell
and
there
trammpled
and
danced
a
fandango
upon
it
in
an
absolute
ecstasy
and
agony
of
rage
meantime
i
sank
aghast
into
the
chair
which
she
had
vacated
â€œmoissart
and
voissartâ€
i
repeated
thoughtfully
as
she
cut
one
of
her
pigeon-wings
and
â€œcroissart
and
froissartâ€
as
she
completed
another--â€œmoissart
and
voissart
and
croissart
and
napoleon

froissart--why
you
ineffable
old
serpent
thatâ€™s
me--thatâ€™s
me--dâ€™ye

i
screamed
at
the
top
of
my
voice--â€œthatâ€™s

madame
eugenie
lalande
quasi
simpson--formerly
moissart--was
in
sober
fact
my
great
great
grandmother
in
her
youth
she
had
been
beautiful
and
even
at
eighty-two
retained
the
majestic
height
the
sculptural
contour
of
head
the
fine
eyes
and
the
grecian
nose
of
her
girlhood
by
the
aid
of
these
of
pearl-powder
of
rouge
of
false
hair
false
teeth
and
false
tournure
as
well
as
of
the
most
skilful
modistes
of
paris
she
contrived
to
hold
a
respectable
footing
among
the
beauties
en
peu
passees
of
the
french
metropolis
in
this
respect
indeed
she
might
have
been
regarded
as
little
less
than
the
equal
of
the
celebrated
ninon
de
lâ€™enclos
she
was
immensely
wealthy
and
being
left
for
the
second
time
a
widow
without
children
she
bethought
herself
of
my
existence
in
america
and
for
the
purpose
of
making
me
her
heir
paid
a
visit
to
the
united
states
in
company
with
a
distant
and
exceedingly
lovely
relative
of
her
second
husbandâ€™s--a
madame
stephanie
lalande
at
the
opera
my
great
great
grandmotherâ€™s
attention
was
arrested
by
my
notice
and
upon
surveying
me
through
her
eye-glass
she
was
struck
with
a
certain
family
resemblance
to
herself
thus
interested
and
knowing
that
the
heir
she
sought
was
actually
in
the
city
she
made
inquiries
of
her
party
respecting
me
the
gentleman
who
attended
her
knew
my
person
and
told
her
who
i
was
the
information
thus
obtained
induced
her
to
renew
her
scrutiny
and
this
scrutiny
it
was
which
so
emboldened
me
that
i
behaved
in
the
absurd
manner
already
detailed
she
returned
my
bow
however
under
the
impression
that
by
some
odd
accident
i
had
discovered
her
identity
when
deceived
by
my
weakness
of
vision
and
the
arts
of
the
toilet
in
respect
to
the
age
and
charms
of
the
strange
lady
i
demanded
so
enthusiastically
of
talbot
who
she
was
he
concluded
that
i
meant
the
younger
beauty
as
a
matter
of
course
and
so
informed
me
with
perfect
truth
that
she
was
â€œthe
celebrated
widow
madame
lalandeâ€
in
the
street
next
morning
my
great
great
grandmother
encountered
talbot
an
old
parisian
acquaintance
and
the
conversation
very
naturally
turned
upon
myself
my
deficiencies
of
vision
were
then
explained
for
these
were
notorious
although
i
was
entirely
ignorant
of
their
notoriety
and
my
good
old
relative
discovered
much
to
her
chagrin
that
she
had
been
deceived
in
supposing
me
aware
of
her
identity
and
that
i
had
been
merely
making
a
fool
of
myself
in
making
open
love
in
a
theatre
to
an
old
woman
unknown
by
way
of
punishing
me
for
this
imprudence
she
concocted
with
talbot
a
plot
he
purposely
kept
out
of
my
way
to
avoid
giving
me
the
introduction
my
street
inquiries
about
â€œthe
lovely
widow
madame
lalandeâ€
were
supposed
to
refer
to
the
younger
lady
of
course
and
thus
the
conversation
with
the
three
gentlemen
whom
i
encountered
shortly
after
leaving
talbotâ€™s
hotel
will
be
easily
explained
as
also
their
allusion
to
ninon
de
lâ€™enclos
i
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
madame
lalande
closely
during
daylight
and
at
her
musical
soiree
my
silly
weakness
in
refusing
the
aid
of
glasses
effectually
prevented
me
from
making
a
discovery
of
her
age
when
â€œmadame
lalandeâ€
was
called
upon
to
sing
the
younger
lady
was
intended
and
it
was
she
who
arose
to
obey
the
call
my
great
great
grandmother
to
further
the
deception
arising
at
the
same
moment
and
accompanying
her
to
the
piano
in
the
main
drawing-room
had
i
decided
upon
escorting
her
thither
it
had
been
her
design
to
suggest
the
propriety
of
my
remaining
where
i
was
but
my
own
prudential
views
rendered
this
unnecessary
the
songs
which
i
so
much
admired
and
which
so
confirmed
my
impression
of
the
youth
of
my
mistress
were
executed
by
madame
stephanie
lalande
the
eyeglass
was
presented
by
way
of
adding
a
reproof
to
the
hoax--a
sting
to
the
epigram
of
the
deception
its
presentation
afforded
an
opportunity
for
the
lecture
upon
affectation
with
which
i
was
so
especially
edified
it
is
almost
superfluous
to
add
that
the
glasses
of
the
instrument
as
worn
by
the
old
lady
had
been
exchanged
by
her
for
a
pair
better
adapted
to
my
years
they
suited
me
in
fact
to
a
t
the
clergyman
who
merely
pretended
to
tie
the
fatal
knot
was
a
boon
companion
of
talbotâ€™s
and
no
priest
he
was
an
excellent
â€œwhipâ€
however
and
having
doffed
his
cassock
to
put
on
a
great-coat
he
drove
the
hack
which
conveyed
the
â€œhappy
coupleâ€
out
of
town
talbot
took
a
seat
at
his
side
the
two
scoundrels
were
thus
â€œin
at
the
deathâ€
and
through
a
half-open
window
of
the
back
parlor
of
the
inn
amused
themselves
in
grinning
at
the
denouement
of
the
drama
i
believe
i
shall
be
forced
to
call
them
both
out
nevertheless
i
am
not
the
husband
of
my
great
great
grandmother
and
this
is
a
reflection
which
affords
me
infinite
relief--but
i
am
the
husband
of
madame
lalande--of
madame
stephanie
lalande--with
whom
my
good
old
relative
besides
making
me
her
sole
heir
when
she
dies--if
she
ever
does--has
been
at
the
trouble
of
concocting
me
a
match
in
conclusion
i
am
done
forever
with
billets

and
am
never
to
be
met
without

buckhurstâ€™s
tragedy
of

about
twelve
oâ€™clock
one
night
in
the
month
of
october
and
during
the
chivalrous
reign
of
the
third
edward
two
seamen
belonging
to
the
crew
of
the
â€œfree
and
easyâ€
a
trading
schooner
plying
between
sluys
and
the
thames
and
then
at
anchor
in
that
river
were
much
astonished
to
find
themselves
seated
in
the
tap-room
of
an
ale-house
in
the
parish
of
st
andrews
london--which
ale-house
bore
for
sign
the
portraiture
of
a
â€œjolly
tarâ€
the
room
although
ill-contrived
smoke-blackened
low-pitched
and
in
every
other
respect
agreeing
with
the
general
character
of
such
places
at
the
period--was
nevertheless
in
the
opinion
of
the
grotesque
groups
scattered
here
and
there
within
it
sufficiently
well
adapted
to
its
purpose
of
these
groups
our
two
seamen
formed
i
think
the
most
interesting
if
not
the
most
conspicuous
the
one
who
appeared
to
be
the
elder
and
whom
his
companion
addressed
by
the
characteristic
appellation
of
â€œlegsâ€
was
at
the
same
time
much
the
taller
of
the
two
he
might
have
measured
six
feet
and
a
half
and
an
habitual
stoop
in
the
shoulders
seemed
to
have
been
the
necessary
consequence
of
an
altitude
so
enormous--superfluities
in
height
were
however
more
than
accounted
for
by
deficiencies
in
other
respects
he
was
exceedingly
thin
and
might
as
his
associates
asserted
have
answered
when
drunk
for
a
pennant
at
the
mast-head
or
when
sober
have
served
for
a
jib-boom
but
these
jests
and
others
of
a
similar
nature
had
evidently
produced
at
no
time
any
effect
upon
the
cachinnatory
muscles
of
the
tar
with
high
cheek-bones
a
large
hawk-nose
retreating
chin
fallen
under-jaw
and
huge
protruding
white
eyes
the
expression
of
his
countenance
although
tinged
with
a
species
of
dogged
indifference
to
matters
and
things
in
general
was
not
the
less
utterly
solemn
and
serious
beyond
all
attempts
at
imitation
or
description
the
younger
seaman
was
in
all
outward
appearance
the
converse
of
his
companion
his
stature
could
not
have
exceeded
four
feet
a
pair
of
stumpy
bow-legs
supported
his
squat
unwieldy
figure
while
his
unusually
short
and
thick
arms
with
no
ordinary
fists
at
their
extremities
swung
off
dangling
from
his
sides
like
the
fins
of
a
sea-turtle
small
eyes
of
no
particular
color
twinkled
far
back
in
his
head
his
nose
remained
buried
in
the
mass
of
flesh
which
enveloped
his
round
full
and
purple
face
and
his
thick
upper-lip
rested
upon
the
still
thicker
one
beneath
with
an
air
of
complacent
self-satisfaction
much
heightened
by
the
ownerâ€™s
habit
of
licking
them
at
intervals
he
evidently
regarded
his
tall
shipmate
with
a
feeling
half-wondrous
half-quizzical
and
stared
up
occasionally
in
his
face
as
the
red
setting
sun
stares
up
at
the
crags
of
ben
nevis
various
and
eventful
however
had
been
the
peregrinations
of
the
worthy
couple
in
and
about
the
different
tap-houses
of
the
neighbourhood
during
the
earlier
hours
of
the
night
funds
even
the
most
ample
are
not
always
everlasting
and
it
was
with
empty
pockets
our
friends
had
ventured
upon
the
present
hostelrie
at
the
precise
period
then
when
this
history
properly
commences
legs
and
his
fellow
hugh
tarpaulin
sat
each
with
both
elbows
resting
upon
the
large
oaken
table
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
with
a
hand
upon
either
cheek
they
were
eyeing
from
behind
a
huge
flagon
of
unpaid-for
â€œhumming-stuffâ€
the
portentous
words
â€œno
chalkâ€
which
to
their
indignation
and
astonishment
were
scored
over
the
doorway
by
means
of
that
very
mineral
whose
presence
they
purported
to
deny
not
that
the
gift
of
decyphering
written
characters--a
gift
among
the
commonalty
of
that
day
considered
little
less
cabalistical
than
the
art
of
inditing--could
in
strict
justice
have
been
laid
to
the
charge
of
either
disciple
of
the
sea
but
there
was
to
say
the
truth
a
certain
twist
in
the
formation
of
the
letters--an
indescribable
lee-lurch
about
the
whole--which
foreboded
in
the
opinion
of
both
seamen
a
long
run
of
dirty
weather
and
determined
them
at
once
in
the
allegorical
words
of
legs
himself
to
â€œpump
ship
clew
up
all
sail
and
scud
before
the
windâ€
having
accordingly
disposed
of
what
remained
of
the
ale
and
looped
up
the
points
of
their
short
doublets
they
finally
made
a
bolt
for
the
street
although
tarpaulin
rolled
twice
into
the
fire-place
mistaking
it
for
the
door
yet
their
escape
was
at
length
happily
effected--and
half
after
twelve
oâ€™clock
found
our
heroes
ripe
for
mischief
and
running
for
life
down
a
dark
alley
in
the
direction
of
st
andrewâ€™s
stair
hotly
pursued
by
the
landlady
of
the
â€œjolly
tarâ€
at
the
epoch
of
this
eventful
tale
and
periodically
for
many
years
before
and
after
all
england
but
more
especially
the
metropolis
resounded
with
the
fearful
cry
of
â€œplagueâ€
the
city
was
in
a
great
measure
depopulated--and
in
those
horrible
regions
in
the
vicinity
of
the
thames
where
amid
the
dark
narrow
and
filthy
lanes
and
alleys
the
demon
of
disease
was
supposed
to
have
had
his
nativity
awe
terror
and
superstition
were
alone
to
be
found
stalking
abroad
by
authority
of
the
king
such
districts
were
placed
under
ban
and
all
persons
forbidden
under
pain
of
death
to
intrude
upon
their
dismal
solitude
yet
neither
the
mandate
of
the
monarch
nor
the
huge
barriers
erected
at
the
entrances
of
the
streets
nor
the
prospect
of
that
loathsome
death
which
with
almost
absolute
certainty
overwhelmed
the
wretch
whom
no
peril
could
deter
from
the
adventure
prevented
the
unfurnished
and
untenanted
dwellings
from
being
stripped
by
the
hand
of
nightly
rapine
of
every
article
such
as
iron
brass
or
lead-work
which
could
in
any
manner
be
turned
to
a
profitable
account
above
all
it
was
usually
found
upon
the
annual
winter
opening
of
the
barriers
that
locks
bolts
and
secret
cellars
had
proved
but
slender
protection
to
those
rich
stores
of
wines
and
liquors
which
in
consideration
of
the
risk
and
trouble
of
removal
many
of
the
numerous
dealers
having
shops
in
the
neighbourhood
had
consented
to
trust
during
the
period
of
exile
to
so
insufficient
a
security
but
there
were
very
few
of
the
terror-stricken
people
who
attributed
these
doings
to
the
agency
of
human
hands
pest-spirits
plague-goblins
and
fever-demons
were
the
popular
imps
of
mischief
and
tales
so
blood-chilling
were
hourly
told
that
the
whole
mass
of
forbidden
buildings
was
at
length
enveloped
in
terror
as
in
a
shroud
and
the
plunderer
himself
was
often
scared
away
by
the
horrors
his
own
depreciations
had
created
leaving
the
entire
vast
circuit
of
prohibited
district
to
gloom
silence
pestilence
and
death
it
was
by
one
of
the
terrific
barriers
already
mentioned
and
which
indicated
the
region
beyond
to
be
under
the
pest-ban
that
in
scrambling
down
an
alley
legs
and
the
worthy
hugh
tarpaulin
found
their
progress
suddenly
impeded
to
return
was
out
of
the
question
and
no
time
was
to
be
lost
as
their
pursuers
were
close
upon
their
heels
with
thorough-bred
seamen
to
clamber
up
the
roughly
fashioned
plank-work
was
a
trifle
and
maddened
with
the
twofold
excitement
of
exercise
and
liquor
they
leaped
unhesitatingly
down
within
the
enclosure
and
holding
on
their
drunken
course
with
shouts
and
yellings
were
soon
bewildered
in
its
noisome
and
intricate
recesses
had
they
not
indeed
been
intoxicated
beyond
moral
sense
their
reeling
footsteps
must
have
been
palsied
by
the
horrors
of
their
situation
the
air
was
cold
and
misty
the
paving-stones
loosened
from
their
beds
lay
in
wild
disorder
amid
the
tall
rank
grass
which
sprang
up
around
the
feet
and
ankles
fallen
houses
choked
up
the
streets
the
most
fetid
and
poisonous
smells
everywhere
prevailed--and
by
the
aid
of
that
ghastly
light
which
even
at
midnight
never
fails
to
emanate
from
a
vapory
and
pestilential
atmosphere
might
be
discerned
lying
in
the
by-paths
and
alleys
or
rotting
in
the
windowless
habitations
the
carcass
of
many
a
nocturnal
plunderer
arrested
by
the
hand
of
the
plague
in
the
very
perpetration
of
his
robbery
--but
it
lay
not
in
the
power
of
images
or
sensations
or
impediments
such
as
these
to
stay
the
course
of
men
who
naturally
brave
and
at
that
time
especially
brimful
of
courage
and
of
â€œhumming-stuffâ€
would
have
reeled
as
straight
as
their
condition
might
have
permitted
undauntedly
into
the
very
jaws
of
death
onward--still
onward
stalked
the
grim
legs
making
the
desolate
solemnity
echo
and
re-echo
with
yells
like
the
terrific
war-whoop
of
the
indian
and
onward
still
onward
rolled
the
dumpy
tarpaulin
hanging
on
to
the
doublet
of
his
more
active
companion
and
far
surpassing
the
latterâ€™s
most
strenuous
exertions
in
the
way
of
vocal
music
by
bull-roarings
in
basso
from
the
profundity
of
his
stentorian
lungs
they
had
now
evidently
reached
the
strong
hold
of
the
pestilence
their
way
at
every
step
or
plunge
grew
more
noisome
and
more
horrible--the
paths
more
narrow
and
more
intricate
huge
stones
and
beams
falling
momently
from
the
decaying
roofs
above
them
gave
evidence
by
their
sullen
and
heavy
descent
of
the
vast
height
of
the
surrounding
houses
and
while
actual
exertion
became
necessary
to
force
a
passage
through
frequent
heaps
of
rubbish
it
was
by
no
means
seldom
that
the
hand
fell
upon
a
skeleton
or
rested
upon
a
more
fleshly
corpse
suddenly
as
the
seamen
stumbled
against
the
entrance
of
a
tall
and
ghastly-looking
building
a
yell
more
than
usually
shrill
from
the
throat
of
the
excited
legs
was
replied
to
from
within
in
a
rapid
succession
of
wild
laughter-like
and
fiendish
shrieks
nothing
daunted
at
sounds
which
of
such
a
nature
at
such
a
time
and
in
such
a
place
might
have
curdled
the
very
blood
in
hearts
less
irrevocably
on
fire
the
drunken
couple
rushed
headlong
against
the
door
burst
it
open
and
staggered
into
the
midst
of
things
with
a
volley
of
curses
the
room
within
which
they
found
themselves
proved
to
be
the
shop
of
an
undertaker
but
an
open
trap-door
in
a
corner
of
the
floor
near
the
entrance
looked
down
upon
a
long
range
of
wine-cellars
whose
depths
the
occasional
sound
of
bursting
bottles
proclaimed
to
be
well
stored
with
their
appropriate
contents
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
table--in
the
centre
of
which
again
arose
a
huge
tub
of
what
appeared
to
be
punch
bottles
of
various
wines
and
cordials
together
with
jugs
pitchers
and
flagons
of
every
shape
and
quality
were
scattered
profusely
upon
the
board
around
it
upon
coffin-tressels
was
seated
a
company
of
six
this
company
i
will
endeavor
to
delineate
one
by
one
fronting
the
entrance
and
elevated
a
little
above
his
companions
sat
a
personage
who
appeared
to
be
the
president
of
the
table
his
stature
was
gaunt
and
tall
and
legs
was
confounded
to
behold
in
him
a
figure
more
emaciated
than
himself
his
face
was
as
yellow
as
saffron--but
no
feature
excepting
one
alone
was
sufficiently
marked
to
merit
a
particular
description
this
one
consisted
in
a
forehead
so
unusually
and
hideously
lofty
as
to
have
the
appearance
of
a
bonnet
or
crown
of
flesh
superadded
upon
the
natural
head
his
mouth
was
puckered
and
dimpled
into
an
expression
of
ghastly
affability
and
his
eyes
as
indeed
the
eyes
of
all
at
table
were
glazed
over
with
the
fumes
of
intoxication
this
gentleman
was
clothed
from
head
to
foot
in
a
richly-embroidered
black
silk-velvet
pall
wrapped
negligently
around
his
form
after
the
fashion
of
a
spanish
cloak--his
head
was
stuck
full
of
sable
hearse-plumes
which
he
nodded
to
and
fro
with
a
jaunty
and
knowing
air
and
in
his
right
hand
he
held
a
huge
human
thigh-bone
with
which
he
appeared
to
have
been
just
knocking
down
some
member
of
the
company
for
a
song
opposite
him
and
with
her
back
to
the
door
was
a
lady
of
no
whit
the
less
extraordinary
character
although
quite
as
tall
as
the
person
just
described
she
had
no
right
to
complain
of
his
unnatural
emaciation
she
was
evidently
in
the
last
stage
of
a
dropsy
and
her
figure
resembled
nearly
that
of
the
huge
puncheon
of
october
beer
which
stood
with
the
head
driven
in
close
by
her
side
in
a
corner
of
the
chamber
her
face
was
exceedingly
round
red
and
full
and
the
same
peculiarity
or
rather
want
of
peculiarity
attached
itself
to
her
countenance
which
i
before
mentioned
in
the
case
of
the
president--that
is
to
say
only
one
feature
of
her
face
was
sufficiently
distinguished
to
need
a
separate
characterization
indeed
the
acute
tarpaulin
immediately
observed
that
the
same
remark
might
have
applied
to
each
individual
person
of
the
party
every
one
of
whom
seemed
to
possess
a
monopoly
of
some
particular
portion
of
physiognomy
with
the
lady
in
question
this
portion
proved
to
be
the
mouth
commencing
at
the
right
ear
it
swept
with
a
terrific
chasm
to
the
left--the
short
pendants
which
she
wore
in
either
auricle
continually
bobbing
into
the
aperture
she
made
however
every
exertion
to
keep
her
mouth
closed
and
look
dignified
in
a
dress
consisting
of
a
newly
starched
and
ironed
shroud
coming
up
close
under
her
chin
with
a
crimpled
ruffle
of
cambric
muslin
at
her
right
hand
sat
a
diminutive
young
lady
whom
she
appeared
to
patronise
this
delicate
little
creature
in
the
trembling
of
her
wasted
fingers
in
the
livid
hue
of
her
lips
and
in
the
slight
hectic
spot
which
tinged
her
otherwise
leaden
complexion
gave
evident
indications
of
a
galloping
consumption
an
air
of
gave
extreme
haut
ton
however
pervaded
her
whole
appearance
she
wore
in
a
graceful
and
degage
manner
a
large
and
beautiful
winding-sheet
of
the
finest
india
lawn
her
hair
hung
in
ringlets
over
her
neck
a
soft
smile
played
about
her
mouth
but
her
nose
extremely
long
thin
sinuous
flexible
and
pimpled
hung
down
far
below
her
under
lip
and
in
spite
of
the
delicate
manner
in
which
she
now
and
then
moved
it
to
one
side
or
the
other
with
her
tongue
gave
to
her
countenance
a
somewhat
equivocal
expression
over
against
her
and
upon
the
left
of
the
dropsical
lady
was
seated
a
little
puffy
wheezing
and
gouty
old
man
whose
cheeks
reposed
upon
the
shoulders
of
their
owner
like
two
huge
bladders
of
oporto
wine
with
his
arms
folded
and
with
one
bandaged
leg
deposited
upon
the
table
he
seemed
to
think
himself
entitled
to
some
consideration
he
evidently
prided
himself
much
upon
every
inch
of
his
personal
appearance
but
took
more
especial
delight
in
calling
attention
to
his
gaudy-colored
surtout
this
to
say
the
truth
must
have
cost
him
no
little
money
and
was
made
to
fit
him
exceedingly
well--being
fashioned
from
one
of
the
curiously
embroidered
silken
covers
appertaining
to
those
glorious
escutcheons
which
in
england
and
elsewhere
are
customarily
hung
up
in
some
conspicuous
place
upon
the
dwellings
of
departed
aristocracy
next
to
him
and
at
the
right
hand
of
the
president
was
a
gentleman
in
long
white
hose
and
cotton
drawers
his
frame
shook
in
a
ridiculous
manner
with
a
fit
of
what
tarpaulin
called
â€œthe
horrorsâ€
his
jaws
which
had
been
newly
shaved
were
tightly
tied
up
by
a
bandage
of
muslin
and
his
arms
being
fastened
in
a
similar
way
at
the
wrists
i
prevented
him
from
helping
himself
too
freely
to
the
liquors
upon
the
table
a
precaution
rendered
necessary
in
the
opinion
of
legs
by
the
peculiarly
sottish
and
wine-bibbing
cast
of
his
visage
a
pair
of
prodigious
ears
nevertheless
which
it
was
no
doubt
found
impossible
to
confine
towered
away
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
apartment
and
were
occasionally
pricked
up
in
a
spasm
at
the
sound
of
the
drawing
of
a
cork
fronting
him
sixthly
and
lastly
was
situated
a
singularly
stiff-looking
personage
who
being
afflicted
with
paralysis
must
to
speak
seriously
have
felt
very
ill
at
ease
in
his
unaccommodating
habiliments
he
was
habited
somewhat
uniquely
in
a
new
and
handsome
mahogany
coffin
its
top
or
head-piece
pressed
upon
the
skull
of
the
wearer
and
extended
over
it
in
the
fashion
of
a
hood
giving
to
the
entire
face
an
air
of
indescribable
interest
arm-holes
had
been
cut
in
the
sides
for
the
sake
not
more
of
elegance
than
of
convenience
but
the
dress
nevertheless
prevented
its
proprietor
from
sitting
as
erect
as
his
associates
and
as
he
lay
reclining
against
his
tressel
at
an
angle
of
forty-five
degrees
a
pair
of
huge
goggle
eyes
rolled
up
their
awful
whites
towards
the
ceiling
in
absolute
amazement
at
their
own
enormity
before
each
of
the
party
lay
a
portion
of
a
skull
which
was
used
as
a
drinking
cup
overhead
was
suspended
a
human
skeleton
by
means
of
a
rope
tied
round
one
of
the
legs
and
fastened
to
a
ring
in
the
ceiling
the
other
limb
confined
by
no
such
fetter
stuck
off
from
the
body
at
right
angles
causing
the
whole
loose
and
rattling
frame
to
dangle
and
twirl
about
at
the
caprice
of
every
occasional
puff
of
wind
which
found
its
way
into
the
apartment
in
the
cranium
of
this
hideous
thing
lay
quantity
of
ignited
charcoal
which
threw
a
fitful
but
vivid
light
over
the
entire
scene
while
coffins
and
other
wares
appertaining
to
the
shop
of
an
undertaker
were
piled
high
up
around
the
room
and
against
the
windows
preventing
any
ray
from
escaping
into
the
street
at
sight
of
this
extraordinary
assembly
and
of
their
still
more
extraordinary
paraphernalia
our
two
seamen
did
not
conduct
themselves
with
that
degree
of
decorum
which
might
have
been
expected
legs
leaning
against
the
wall
near
which
he
happened
to
be
standing
dropped
his
lower
jaw
still
lower
than
usual
and
spread
open
his
eyes
to
their
fullest
extent
while
hugh
tarpaulin
stooping
down
so
as
to
bring
his
nose
upon
a
level
with
the
table
and
spreading
out
a
palm
upon
either
knee
burst
into
a
long
loud
and
obstreperous
roar
of
very
ill-timed
and
immoderate
laughter
without
however
taking
offence
at
behaviour
so
excessively
rude
the
tall
president
smiled
very
graciously
upon
the
intruders--nodded
to
them
in
a
dignified
manner
with
his
head
of
sable
plumes--and
arising
took
each
by
an
arm
and
led
him
to
a
seat
which
some
others
of
the
company
had
placed
in
the
meantime
for
his
accommodation
legs
to
all
this
offered
not
the
slightest
resistance
but
sat
down
as
he
was
directed
while
the
gallant
hugh
removing
his
coffin
tressel
from
its
station
near
the
head
of
the
table
to
the
vicinity
of
the
little
consumptive
lady
in
the
winding
sheet
plumped
down
by
her
side
in
high
glee
and
pouring
out
a
skull
of
red
wine
quaffed
it
to
their
better
acquaintance
but
at
this
presumption
the
stiff
gentleman
in
the
coffin
seemed
exceedingly
nettled
and
serious
consequences
might
have
ensued
had
not
the
president
rapping
upon
the
table
with
his
truncheon
diverted
the
attention
of
all
present
to
the
following
speech
â€œit
becomes
our
duty
upon
the
present
happy
occasionâ€--
â€œavast
thereâ€
interrupted
legs
looking
very
serious
â€œavast
there
a
bit
i
say
and
tell
us
who
the
devil
ye
all
are
and
what
business
ye
have
here
rigged
off
like
the
foul
fiends
and
swilling
the
snug
blue
ruin
stowed
away
for
the
winter
by
my
honest
shipmate
will
wimble
the
undertakerâ€
at
this
unpardonable
piece
of
ill-breeding
all
the
original
company
half
started
to
their
feet
and
uttered
the
same
rapid
succession
of
wild
fiendish
shrieks
which
had
before
caught
the
attention
of
the
seamen
the
president
however
was
the
first
to
recover
his
composure
and
at
length
turning
to
legs
with
great
dignity
recommenced
â€œmost
willingly
will
we
gratify
any
reasonable
curiosity
on
the
part
of
guests
so
illustrious
unbidden
though
they
be
know
then
that
in
these
dominions
i
am
monarch
and
here
rule
with
undivided
empire
under
the
title
of
â€˜king
pest
the
firstâ€™
â€œthis
apartment
which
you
no
doubt
profanely
suppose
to
be
the
shop
of
will
wimble
the
undertaker--a
man
whom
we
know
not
and
whose
plebeian
appellation
has
never
before
this
night
thwarted
our
royal
ears--this
apartment
i
say
is
the
dais-chamber
of
our
palace
devoted
to
the
councils
of
our
kingdom
and
to
other
sacred
and
lofty
purposes
â€œthe
noble
lady
who
sits
opposite

queen
pest
our
serene
consort
the
other
exalted
personages
whom
you
behold
are
all
of
our
family
and
wear
the
insignia
of
the
blood
royal
under
the
respective
titles
of
â€˜his

â€˜her

â€œas

continued
he
â€œyour
demand
of
the
business
upon
which
we
sit
here
in
council
we
might
be
pardoned
for
replying
that
it
concerns
and
concerns
alone
our
own
private
and
regal
interest
and
is
in
no
manner
important
to
any
other
than
ourself
but
in
consideration
of
those
rights
to
which
as
guests
and
strangers
you
may
feel
yourselves
entitled
we
will
furthermore
explain
that
we
are
here
this
night
prepared
by
deep
research
and
accurate
investigation
to
examine
analyze
and
thoroughly
determine
the
indefinable
spirit--the
incomprehensible
qualities
and
nature--of
those
inestimable
treasures
of
the
palate
the
wines
ales
and
liqueurs
of
this
goodly
metropolis
by
so
doing
to
advance
not
more
our
own
designs
than
the
true
welfare
of
that
unearthly
sovereign
whose
reign
is
over
us
all
whose
dominions
are
unlimited
and
whose
name
is
â€˜deathâ€™â€
â€œwhose
name
is

ejaculated
tarpaulin
helping
the
lady
by
his
side
to
a
skull
of
liqueur
and
pouring
out
a
second
for
himself
â€œprofane
varletâ€
said
the
president
now
turning
his
attention
to
the
worthy
hugh
â€œprofane
and
execrable
wretch--we
have
said
that
in
consideration
of
those
rights
which
even
in
thy
filthy
person
we
feel
no
inclination
to
violate
we
have
condescended
to
make
reply
to
thy
rude
and
unseasonable
inquiries
we
nevertheless
for
your
unhallowed
intrusion
upon
our
councils
believe
it
our
duty
to
mulct
thee
and
thy
companion
in
each
a
gallon
of
black
strap--having
imbibed
which
to
the
prosperity
of
our
kingdom--at
a
single
draught--and
upon
your
bended
knees--ye
shall
be
forthwith
free
either
to
proceed
upon
your
way
or
remain
and
be
admitted
to
the
privileges
of
our
table
according
to
your
respective
and
individual
pleasuresâ€
â€œit
would
be
a
matter
of
utter
impossibilityâ€
replied
legs
whom
the
assumptions
and
dignity
of
king
pest
the
first
had
evidently
inspired
some
feelings
of
respect
and
who
arose
and
steadied
himself
by
the
table
as
he
spoke--â€œit
would
please
your
majesty
be
a
matter
of
utter
impossibility
to
stow
away
in
my
hold
even
one-fourth
part
of
the
same
liquor
which
your
majesty
has
just
mentioned
to
say
nothing
of
the
stuffs
placed
on
board
in
the
forenoon
by
way
of
ballast
and
not
to
mention
the
various
ales
and
liqueurs
shipped
this
evening
at
different
sea-ports
i
have
at
present
a
full
cargo
of
â€˜humming
stuffâ€™
taken
in
and
duly
paid
for
at
the
sign
of
the
â€˜jolly
tarâ€™
you
will
therefore
please
your
majesty
be
so
good
as
to
take
the
will
for
the
deed--for
by
no
manner
of
means
either
can
i
or
will
i
swallow
another
drop--least
of
all
a
drop
of
that
villainous
bilge-water
that
answers
to
the
hall
of
â€˜black

â€œbelay
thatâ€
interrupted
tarpaulin
astonished
not
more
at
the
length
of
his
companionâ€™s
speech
than
at
the
nature
of
his
refusal--â€œbelay
that
you
tubber--and
i
say
legs
none
of
your
palaver
my
hull
is
still
light
although
i
confess
you
yourself
seem
to
be
a
little
top-heavy
and
as
for
the
matter
of
your
share
of
the
cargo
why
rather
than
raise
a
squall
i
would
find
stowageroom

butâ€--
â€œthis
proceedingâ€
interposed
the
president
â€œis
by
no

in

terms

is
in
its
nature

not
to

altered

we
have
imposed

be
fulfilled
to
the

that
without

hesitation--in

we
decree
that

together

drowned

â€œa

most
worthy

condemnationâ€
shouted
the
pest
family
altogether
the
king
elevated
his
forehead
into
innumerable
wrinkles
the
gouty
little
old
man
puffed
like
a
pair
of
bellows
the
lady
of
the
winding
sheet
waved
her
nose
to
and
fro
the
gentleman
in
the
cotton
drawers
pricked
up
his
ears
she
of
the
shroud
gasped
like
a
dying
fish
and
he
of
the
coffin
looked
stiff
and
rolled
up
his
eyes
â€œugh

tarpaulin
without
heeding
the
general
excitation
â€œugh

said
he
â€œi
was
saying
when
mr

poked
in
his
marlin-spike
that
as
for
the
matter
of
two
or
three
gallons
more
or
less
of
black
strap
it
was
a
trifle
to
a
tight
sea-boat

not
overstowed--but

to

health

the

itâ€™s
quite
another
guess
sort
of
a

and
utterly
and
altogether
past
my
comprehensionâ€
he
was
not
allowed
to
finish
this
speech
in
tranquillity
at
the
name
tim
hurlygurly
the
whole
assembly
leaped
from
their
name
seats
â€œtreasonâ€
shouted
his
majesty
king
pest
the
first
â€œtreasonâ€
said
the
little
man
with
the
gout
â€œtreasonâ€
screamed
the
arch

â€œtreasonâ€

the
gentleman
with
his
jaws
tied
up
â€œtreasonâ€
growled
he
of
the
coffin
â€œtreason

shrieked
her
majesty
of
the
mouth
and
seizing
by
the
hinder
part
of
his
breeches
the
unfortunate
tarpaulin
who
had
just
commenced
pouring
out
for
himself
a
skull
of
liqueur
she
lifted
him
high
into
the
air
and
let
him
fall
without
ceremony
into
the
huge
open
puncheon
of
his
beloved
ale
bobbing
up
and
down
for
a
few
seconds
like
an
apple
in
a
bowl
of
toddy
he
at
length
finally
disappeared
amid
the
whirlpool
of
foam
which
in
the
already
effervescent
liquor
his
struggles
easily
succeeded
in
creating
not
tamely
however
did
the
tall
seaman
behold
the
discomfiture
of
his
companion
jostling
king
pest
through
the
open
trap
the
valiant
legs
slammed
the
door
down
upon
him
with
an
oath
and
strode
towards
the
centre
of
the
room
here
tearing
down
the
skeleton
which
swung
over
the
table
he
laid
it
about
him
with
so
much
energy
and
good
will
that
as
the
last
glimpses
of
light
died
away
within
the
apartment
he
succeeded
in
knocking
out
the
brains
of
the
little
gentleman
with
the
gout
rushing
then
with
all
his
force
against
the
fatal
hogshead
full
of
october
ale
and
hugh
tarpaulin
he
rolled
it
over
and
over
in
an
instant
out
burst
a
deluge
of
liquor
so
fierce--so
impetuous--so
overwhelming--that
the
room
was
flooded
from
wall
to
wall--the
loaded
table
was
overturned--the
tressels
were
thrown
upon
their
backs--the
tub
of
punch
into
the
fire-place--and
the
ladies
into
hysterics
piles
of
death-furniture
floundered
about
jugs
pitchers
and
carboys
mingled
promiscuously
in
the
melee
and
wicker
flagons
encountered
desperately
with
bottles
of
junk
the
man
with
the
horrors
was
drowned
upon
the
spot-the
little
stiff
gentleman
floated
off
in
his
coffin--and
the
victorious
legs
seizing
by
the
waist
the
fat
lady
in
the
shroud
rushed
out
with
her
into
the
street
and
made
a
bee-line
for
the
â€œfree
and
easyâ€
followed
under
easy
sail
by
the
redoubtable
hugh
tarpaulin
who
having
sneezed
three
or
four
times
panted
and
puffed
after
him
with
the
arch
duchess
ana-pest
three
sundays
in
a
week
â€œyou
hard-headed
dunder-headed
obstinate
rusty
crusty
musty
fusty
old
savageâ€
said
i
in
fancy
one
afternoon
to
my
grand
uncle
rumgudgeon--shaking
my
fist
at
him
in
imagination
only
in
imagination
the
fact
is
some
trivial
discrepancy
did
exist
just
then
between
what
i
said
and
what
i
had
not
the
courage
to
say--between
what
i
did
and
what
i
had
half
a
mind
to
do
the
old
porpoise
as
i
opened
the
drawing-room
door

sitting
with
his
feet
upon
the
mantel-piece
and
a
bumper
of
port
in

i
closing
the
door
gently
and
approaching
him
with
the
blandest
of
smiles
â€œyou

so
very
kind

considerate

evinced
your
benevolence

â€œi

you
confounded
old

here
he
swallowed
his
bumper
of
port
while
i
rushed
from
the
room
in
despair
a
very
â€œfine
old
english
gentlemanâ€
was
my
grand-uncle
rumgudgeon
but
unlike
him
of
the
song
he
had
his
weak
points
he
was
a
little
pursy
pompous
passionate
semicircular
somebody
with
a
red
nose
a
thick
scull
sic
a
long
purse
and
a
strong
sense
of
his
own
consequence
with
the
best
heart
in
the
world
he
contrived
through
a
predominant
whim
of
contradiction
to
earn
for
himself
among
those
who
only
knew
him
superficially
the
character
of
a
curmudgeon
like
many
excellent
people
he
seemed
possessed
with
a
spirit
of
tantalization
which
might
easily
at
a
casual
glance
have
been
mistaken
for
malevolence
to
every
request
a
positive
â€œnoâ€
was
his
immediate
answer
but
in
the
end--in
the
long
long
end--there
were
exceedingly
few
requests
which
he
refused
against
all
attacks
upon
his
purse
he
made
the
most
sturdy
defence
but
the
amount
extorted
from
him
at
last
was
generally
in
direct
ratio
with
the
length
of
the
siege
and
the
stubbornness
of
the
resistance
in
charity
no
one
gave
more
liberally
or
with
a
worse
grace
for
the
fine
arts
and
especially
for
the
belles-lettres
he
entertained
a
profound
contempt
with
this
he
had
been
inspired
by
casimir
perier
whose
pert
little
query
â€œa
quoi
un
poete
est
il
bonâ€
he
was
in
the
habit
of
quoting
with
a
very
droll
pronunciation
as
the
ne
plus
ultra
of
logical
wit
thus
my
own
inkling
for
the
muses
had
excited
his
entire
displeasure
he
assured
me
one
day
when
i
asked
him
for
a
new
copy
of
horace
that
the
translation
of
â€œpoeta
nascitur
non
fitâ€
was
â€œa
nasty
poet
for
nothing
fitâ€--a
remark
which
i
took
in
high
dudgeon
his
repugnance
to
â€œthe
humanitiesâ€
had
also
much
increased
of
late
by
an
accidental
bias
in
favor
of
what
he
supposed
to
be
natural
science
somebody
had
accosted
him
in
the
street
mistaking
him
for
no
less
a
personage
than
doctor
dubble
l
dee
the
lecturer
upon
quack
physics
this
set
him
off
at
a
tangent
and
just
at
the
epoch
of
this
story--for
story
it
is
getting
to
be
after
all--my
grand-uncle
rumgudgeon
was
accessible
and
pacific
only
upon
points
which
happened
to
chime
in
with
the
caprioles
of
the
hobby
he
was
riding
for
the
rest
he
laughed
with
his
arms
and
legs
and
his
politics
were
stubborn
and
easily
understood
he
thought
with
horsley
that
â€œthe
people
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
laws
but
to
obey
themâ€
i
had
lived
with
the
old
gentleman
all
my
life
my
parents
in
dying
had
bequeathed
me
to
him
as
a
rich
legacy
i
believe
the
old
villain
loved
me
as
his
own
child--nearly
if
not
quite
as
well
as
he
loved
kate--but
it
was
a
dogâ€™s
existence
that
he
led
me
after
all
from
my
first
year
until
my
fifth
he
obliged
me
with
very
regular
floggings
from
five
to
fifteen
he
threatened
me
hourly
with
the
house
of
correction
from
fifteen
to
twenty
not
a
day
passed
in
which
he
did
not
promise
to
cut
me
off
with
a
shilling
i
was
a
sad
dog
it
is
true--but
then
it
was
a
part
of
my
nature--a
point
of
my
faith
in
kate
however
i
had
a
firm
friend
and
i
knew
it
she
was
a
good
girl
and
told
me
very
sweetly
that
i
might
have
her
plum
and
all
whenever
i
could
badger
my
grand-uncle
rumgudgeon
into
the
necessary
consent
poor
girl--she
was
barely
fifteen
and
without
this
consent
her
little
amount
in
the
funds
was
not
come-at-able
until
five
immeasurable
summers
had
â€œdragged
their
slow
length
alongâ€
what
then
to
do
at
fifteen
or
even
at
twenty-one
for
i
had
now
passed
my
fifth
olympiad
five
years
in
prospect
are
very
much
the
same
as
five
hundred
in
vain
we
besieged
the
old
gentleman
with
importunities
here
was
a
piece
de
resistance
as
messieurs
ude
and
careme
would
say
which
suited
his
perverse
fancy
to
a
t
it
would
have
stiffed
the
indignation
of
job
himself
to
see
how
much
like
an
old
mouser
he
behaved
to
us
two
poor
wretched
little
mice
in
his
heart
he
wished
for
nothing
more
ardently
than
our
union
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
this
all
along
in
fact
he
would
have
given
ten
thousand
pounds
from
his
own
pocket
kateâ€™s
plum
was
her
own
if
he
could
have
invented
any
thing
like
an
excuse
for
complying
with
our
very
natural
wishes
but
then
we
had
been
so
imprudent
as
to
broach
the
subject
ourselves
not
to
oppose
it
under
such
circumstances
i
sincerely
believe
was
not
in
his
power
i
have
said
already
that
he
had
his
weak
points
but
in
speaking
of
these
i
must
not
be
understood
as
referring
to
his
obstinacy
which
was
one
of
his
strong
points--â€œassurement
ce
nâ€™
etait
pas
sa
foibleâ€
when
i
mention
his
weakness
i
have
allusion
to
a
bizarre
old-womanish
superstition
which
beset
him
he
was
great
in
dreams
portents
et
id
genus
omne
of
rigmarole
he
was
excessively
punctilious
too
upon
small
points
of
honor
and
after
his
own
fashion
was
a
man
of
his
word
beyond
doubt
this
was
in
fact
one
of
his
hobbies
the
spirit
of
his
vows
he
made
no
scruple
of
setting
at
naught
but
the
letter
was
a
bond
inviolable
now
it
was
this
latter
peculiarity
in
his
disposition
of
which
kateâ€™s
ingenuity
enabled
us
one
fine
day
not
long
after
our
interview
in
the
dining-room
to
take
a
very
unexpected
advantage
and
having
thus
in
the
fashion
of
all
modern
bards
and
orators
exhausted
in
prolegomena
all
the
time
at
my
command
and
nearly
all
the
room
at
my
disposal
i
will
sum
up
in
a
few
words
what
constitutes
the
whole
pith
of
the
story
it
happened
then--so
the
fates
ordered
it--that
among
the
naval
acquaintances
of
my
betrothed
were
two
gentlemen
who
had
just
set
foot
upon
the
shores
of
england
after
a
yearâ€™s
absence
each
in
foreign
travel
in
company
with
these
gentlemen
my
cousin
and
i
preconcertedly
paid
uncle
rumgudgeon
a
visit
on
the
afternoon
of
sunday
october
the
tenth--just
three
weeks
after
the
memorable
decision
which
had
so
cruelly
defeated
our
hopes
for
about
half
an
hour
the
conversation
ran
upon
ordinary
topics
but
at
last
we
contrived
quite
naturally
to
give
it
the
following
turn
capt
pratt
â€œwell
i
have
been
absent
just
one
year--just
one
year
to-day
as
i
live--let
me
see
yes--this
is
october
the
tenth
you
remember
mr
rumgudgeon
i
called
this
day
year
to
bid
you
good-bye
and
by
the
way
it
does
seem
something
like
a
coincidence
does
it
not--that
our
friend
captain
smitherton
here
has
been
absent
exactly
a
year
also--a
year
to-dayâ€
smitherton
â€œyes
just
one
year
to
a
fraction
you
will
remember
mr
rumgudgeon
that
i
called
with
capt
pratol
on
this
very
day
last
year
to
pay
my
parting
respectsâ€
uncle
â€œyes
yes
yes--i
remember
it
very
well--very
queer
indeed
both
of
you
gone
just
one
year
a
very
strange
coincidence
indeed
just
what
doctor
dubble
l
dee
would
denominate
an
extraordinary
concurrence
of
events
doctor
dub-â€
kate
interrupting
â€œto
be
sure
papa
it
is
something
strange
but
then
captain
pratt
and
captain
smitherton
didnâ€™t
go
altogether
the
same
route
and
that
makes
a
difference
you
knowâ€
uncle
â€œi
donâ€™t
know
any
such
thing
you
huzzy
how
should
i
i
think
it
only
makes
the
matter
more
remarkable
doctor
dubble
l
dee--â€
kate
â€œwhy
papa
captain
pratt
went
round
cape
horn
and
captain
smitherton
doubled
the
cape
of
good
hopeâ€
uncle
â€œprecisely--the
one
went
east
and
the
other
went
west
you
jade
and
they
both
have
gone
quite
round
the
world
by
the
by
doctor
dubble
l
dee--â€
myself
hurriedly
â€œcaptain
pratt
you
must
come
and
spend
the
evening
with
us
to-morrow--you
and
smitherton--you
can
tell
us
all
about
your
voyage
and
weâ€™ll
have
a
game
of
whist
and--â€
pratt
â€œwist
my
dear
fellow--you
forget
to-morrow
will
be
sunday
some
other
evening--â€
kate
â€œoh
no
fie--robertâ€™s
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
to-dayâ€™s
sundayâ€
pratt
â€œi
beg
both
your
pardons--but
i
canâ€™t
be
so
much
mistaken
i
know
to-morrowâ€™s
sunday
because-â€
smitherton
much
surprised
â€œwhat
are
you
all
thinking
about
wasnâ€™t
yesterday
sunday
i
should
like
to
knowâ€
all
â€œyesterday
indeed
you
are
outâ€
uncle
â€œto-dayâ€™s
sunday
i
say--donâ€™t
i
knowâ€
pratt
â€œoh
no--to-morrowâ€™s
sundayâ€
smitherton
â€œyou
are
all
mad--every
one
of
you
i
am
as
positive
that
yesterday
was
sunday
as
i
am
that
i
sit
upon
this
chairâ€
kate
jumping
up
eagerly
â€œi
see
it--i
see
it
all
papa
this
is
a
judgment
upon
you
about--about
you
know
what
let
me
alone
and
iâ€™ll
explain
it
all
in
a
minute
itâ€™s
a
very
simple
thing
indeed
captain
smitherton
says
that
yesterday
was
sunday
so
it
was
he
is
right
cousin
bobby
and
uncle
and
i
say
that
to-day
is
sunday
so
it
is
we
are
right
captain
pratt
maintains
that
to-morrow
will
be
sunday
so
it
will
he
is
right
too
the
fact
is
we
are
all
right
and
thus
three
sundays
have
come
together
in
a
weekâ€
smitherton
after
a
pause
â€œby
the
by
pratt
kate
has
us
completely
what
fools
we
two
are
mr
rumgudgeon
the
matter
stands
thus
the
earth
you
know
is
twenty-four
thousand
miles
in
circumference
now
this
globe
of
the
earth
turns
upon
its
own
axis--revolves--spins
round--these
twenty-four
thousand
miles
of
extent
going
from
west
to
east
in
precisely
twenty-four
hours
do
you
understand
mr
rumgudgeon-â€
uncle
â€œto
be
sure--to
be
sure--doctor
dub-â€
smitherton
drowning
his
voice
â€œwell
sir
that
is
at
the
rate
of
one
thousand
miles
per
hour
now
suppose
that
i
sail
from
this
position
a
thousand
miles
east
of
course
i
anticipate
the
rising
of
the
sun
here
at
london
by
just
one
hour
i
see
the
sun
rise
one
hour
before
you
do
proceeding
in
the
same
direction
yet
another
thousand
miles
i
anticipate
the
rising
by
two
hours--another
thousand
and
i
anticipate
it
by
three
hours
and
so
on
until
i
go
entirely
round
the
globe
and
back
to
this
spot
when
having
gone
twenty-four
thousand
miles
east
i
anticipate
the
rising
of
the
london
sun
by
no
less
than
twenty-four
hours
that
is
to
say
i
am
a
day
in
advance
of
your
time
understand
ehâ€
uncle
â€œbut
double
l
dee-â€
smitherton
speaking
very
loud
â€œcaptain
pratt
on
the
contrary
when
he
had
sailed
a
thousand
miles
west
of
this
position
was
an
hour
and
when
he
had
sailed
twenty-four
thousand
miles
west
was
twenty-four
hours
or
one
day
behind
the
time
at
london
thus
with
me
yesterday
was
sunday--thus
with
you
to-day
is
sunday--and
thus
with
pratt
to-morrow
will
be
sunday
and
what
is
more
mr
rumgudgeon
it
is
positively
clear
that
we
are
all
right
for
there
can
be
no
philosophical
reason
assigned
why
the
idea
of
one
of
us
should
have
preference
over
that
of
the
otherâ€
uncle
â€œmy
eyes--well
kate--well
bobby--this
is
a
judgment
upon
me
as
you
say
but
i
am
a
man
of
my
word--mark
that
you
shall
have
her
