this
collection
of
ghost
stories
owes
its
publication
to
an
interest
that
i
have
long
felt
in
the
supernatural
and
in
works
of
the
imagination
as
a
child
i
was
deeply
concerned
in
tales
of
spooks
haunted
houses
wraiths
and
specters
and
stories
of
weird
experiences
clanking
chains
ghostly
sights
and
gruesome
sounds
always
held
me
spellbound
and
breathless
experiences
in
editorial
offices
taught
me
that
i
was
not
alone
in
liking
stories
of
mystery
the
desire
to
know
something
of
that
existence
that
is
veiled
by
death
is
equally
potent
in
old
age
and
in
youth
and
men
women
and
children
like
to
be
thrilled
and
to
have
a
â€œcreepyâ€
feeling
along
the
spinal
column
as
the
result
of
reading
of
a
visitor
from
beyond
the
grave
this
volume
contains
the
most
famous
of
the
weird
stories
of
edgar
allan
poe
that
master
of
this
form
of
literature
â€œthe
black
catâ€
contains
all
the
needed
element
of
mystery
and
supernatural
and
yet
the
feline
acts
in
a
natural
manner
all
of
the
time
and
the
story
is
quite
possibly
true
it
is
only
in
the
manner
of
its
telling
that
the
tale
becomes
one
that
fittingly
finds
its
place
in
this
collection

also
represented
by

effective
bits
of
work
and
other
less

known
writers
have
also
contributed
stories
that
are
worth
reading
and
when
once
read
will
be
remembered
there
is
not
a

among
the
twenty-five
that
is
not
worthy
of
close
reading
there
has
recently
been
a
revival
in
interest
in
ghost
stories
many
of
the
high-class
magazines
have
within
a
few
months
printed
stories
with
supernatural
incidents
and
writers
whose
names
are
known
to
all
who
read
have
turned
their
attention
to
this
form
of
literature
whether
or
not
the
reader
believe
in
ghosts
he
cannot
fail
to
be
interested
in
this
little
book
without
venturing
to
express
a
positive
opinion
either
way
i
will
only
say

twenty-five
ghost
stories
the
black
cat
by
edgar
allan
poe
for
the
most
wild
yet
most
homely
narrative
which
i
am
about
to
pen
i
neither
expect
nor
solicit
belief
mad
indeed
would
i
be
to
expect
it
in
a
case
where
my
very
senses
reject
their
own
evidence
yet
mad
am
i
not--and
very
surely
do
i
not
dream
but
to-morrow
i
die
and
to-day
i
would
unburden
my
soul
my
immediate
purpose
is
to
place
before
the
world
plainly
succinctly
and
without
comment
a
series
of
mere
household
events
in
their
consequences
these
events
have
terrified--have
tortured--have
destroyed
me
yet
i
will
not
attempt
to
expound
them
to
me
they
have
presented
little
but
horror
to
many
they
will
seem
less
terrible
than
baroques
hereafter
perhaps
some
intellect
may
be
found
which
will
reduce
my
phantasm
to
the
commonplace--some
intellect
more
calm
more
logical
and
far
less
excitable
than
my
own
which
will
perceive
in
the
circumstances
i
detail
with
awe
nothing
more
than
an
ordinary
succession
of
very
natural
causes
and
effects
from
my
infancy
i
was
noted
for
the
docility
and
humanity
of
my
disposition
my
tenderness
of
heart
was
even
so
conspicuous
as
to
make
me
the
jest
of
my
companions
i
was
especially
fond
of
animals
and
was
indulged
by
my
parents
with
a
great
variety
of
pets
with
these
i
spent
most
of
my
time
and
never
was
so
happy
as
when
feeding
and
caressing
them
this
peculiarity
of
character
grew
with
my
growth
and
in
my
manhood
i
derived
from
it
one
of
my
principal
sources
of
pleasure
to
those
who
have
cherished
an
affection
for
a
faithful
and
sagacious
dog
i
need
hardly
be
at
the
trouble
of
explaining
the
nature
or
the
intensity
of
the
gratification
thus
derivable
there
is
something
in
the
unselfish
and
self-sacrificing
love
of
a
brute
which
goes
directly
to
the
heart
of
him
who
has
had
frequent
occasion
to
test
the
paltry
friendship
and
gossamer
fidelity
of
mere
man
i
married
early
and
was
happy
to
find
in
my
wife
a
disposition
not
uncongenial
with
my
own
observing
my
partiality
for
domestic
pets
she
lost
no
opportunity
of
procuring
those
of
the
most
agreeable
kind
we
had
birds
goldfish
a
fine
dog
rabbits
a
small
monkey
and
a
cat
this
latter
was
a
remarkably
large
and
beautiful
animal
entirely
black
and
sagacious
to
an
astonishing
degree
in
speaking
of
his
intelligence
my
wife
who
at
heart
was
not
a
little
tinctured
with
superstition
made
frequent
allusion
to
the
ancient
popular
notion
which
regarded
all
black
cats
as
witches
in
disguise
not
that
she
was
ever
serious
upon
this
point--and
i
mention
the
matter
at
all
for
no
better
reason
than
that
it
happens
just
now
to
be
remembered
pluto--this
was
the
catâ€™s
name--was
my
favorite
pet
and
playmate
i
alone
fed
him
and
he
attended
me
wherever
i
went
about
the
house
it
was
even
with
difficulty
that
i
could
prevent
him
from
following
me
through
the
streets
our
friendship
lasted
in
this
manner
for
several
years
during
which
my
general
temperament
and
character--through
the
instrumentality
of
the
fiend
intemperance--had
i
blush
to
confess
it
experienced
a
radical
alteration
for
the
worse
i
grew
day
by
day
more
moody
more
irritable
more
regardless
of
the
feelings
of
others
i
suffered
myself
to
use
intemperate
language
to
my
wife
at
length
i
even
offered
her
personal
violence
my
pets
of
course
were
made
to
feel
the
change
in
my
disposition
i
not
only
neglected
them
but
ill-used
them
for
pluto
however
i
still
retained
sufficient
regard
to
restrain
me
from
maltreating
him
as
i
made
no
scruple
of
maltreating
the
rabbits
the
monkey
or
even
the
dog
when
by
accident
or
through
affection
they
came
in
my
way
but
my
disease
grew
upon
me--for
what
disease
is
like
alcohol
and
at
length
even
pluto
who
was
now
becoming
old
and
consequently
somewhat
peevish--even
pluto
began
to
experience
the
effects
of
my
ill-temper
one
night
returning
home
much
intoxicated
from
one
of
my
haunts
about
town
i
fancied
that
the
cat
avoided
my
presence
i
seized
him
when
in
his
fright
at
my
violence
he
inflicted
a
slight
wound
upon
my
hand
with
his
teeth
the
fury
of
a
demon
instantly
possessed
me
i
knew
myself
no
longer
my
original
soul
seemed
at
once
to
take
its
flight
from
my
body
and
a
more
than
fiendish
malevolence
gin-nurtured
thrilled
every
fiber
of
my
frame
i
took
from
my
waistcoat
pocket
a
penknife
opened
it
grasped
the
poor
beast
by
the
throat
and
deliberately
cut
one
of
its
eyes
from
the
socket
i
blush
i
burn
i
shudder
while
i
pen
the
damnable
atrocity
when
reason
returned
with
the
morning--when
i
had
slept
off
the
fumes
of
the
nightâ€™s
debauch--i
experienced
a
sentiment
half
of
horror
half
of
remorse
for
the
crime
of
which
i
had
been
guilty
but
it
was
at
best
a
feeble
and
equivocal
feeling
and
the
soul
remained
untouched
i
again
plunged
into
excess
and
soon
drowned
in
wine
all
memory
of
the
deed
in
the
meantime
the
cat
slowly
recovered
illustration
â€œone
night
returning
home
much
intoxicatedâ€
the
socket
of
the
lost
eye
presented
it
is
true
a
frightful
appearance
but
he
no
longer
appeared
to
suffer
any
pain
he
went
about
the
house
as
usual
but
as
might
be
expected
fled
in
extreme
terror
at
my
approach
i
had
so
much
of
my
old
heart
left
as
to
be
at
first
grieved
by
this
evident
dislike
on
the
part
of
a
creature
which
had
once
so
loved
me
but
this
feeling
soon
gave
place
to
irritation
and
then
came
as
if
to
my
final
and
irrevocable
overthrow
the
spirit
of
perverseness
of
this
spirit
philosophy
takes
no
account
yet
i
am
not
more
sure
that
my
soul
lives
than
i
am
that
perverseness
is
one
of
the
primitive
impulses
of
the
human
heart--one
of
the
indivisible
primary
faculties
or
sentiments
which
give
direction
to
the
character
of
man
who
has
not
hundreds
of
times
found
himself
committing
a
vile
or
silly
action
for
no
other
reason
than
because
he
knows
he
should
not
have
we
not
a
perpetual
inclination
in
the
teeth
of
our
best
judgment
to
violate
that
which
is
law
merely
because
we
understand
it
to
be
such
this
spirit
of
perverseness
i
say
came
to
my
final
overthrow
it
was
this
unfathomable
longing
of
the
soul
to
vex
itself--to
offer
violence
to
its
own
nature--to
do
wrong
for
the
wrongâ€™s
sake
only--that
urged
me
to
continue
and
finally
to
consummate
the
injury
i
had
inflicted
upon
the
unoffending
brute
one
morning
in
cold
blood
i
slipped
a
noose
about
its
neck
and
hung
it
to
the
limb
of
a
tree
hung
it
with
the
tears
streaming
from
my
eyes
and
the
bitterest
remorse
at
my
heart
hung
it
because
i
knew
that
it
had
loved
me
and
because
i
felt
it
had
given
me
no
offense
hung
it
because
i
knew
that
in
so
doing
i
was
committing
a
sin--a
deadly
sin
that
would
so
jeopardize
my
immortal
soul
as
to
place
it
if
such
a
thing
were
possible--even
beyond
the
reach
of
the
infinite
mercy
of
the
most
merciful
and
most
terrible
god
on
the
night
of
the
day
on
which
this
cruel
deed
was
done
i
was
aroused
from
sleep
by
the
cry
of
â€œfireâ€
the
curtains
of
my
bed
were
in
flames
the
whole
house
was
blazing
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
my
wife
a
servant
and
myself
made
our
escape
from
the
conflagration
the
destruction
was
complete
my
entire
worldly
wealth
was
swallowed
up
and
i
resigned
myself
thenceforward
to
despair
i
am
above
the
weakness
of
seeking
to
establish
a
sequence
of
cause
and
effect
between
the
disaster
and
the
atrocity
but
i
am
detailing
a
chain
of
facts
and
wish
not
to
leave
even
a
possible
link
imperfect
on
the
day
succeeding
the
fire
i
visited
the
ruins
the
walls
with
one
exception
had
fallen
in
this
exception
was
found
in
a
compartment
wall
not
very
thick
which
stood
about
the
middle
of
the
house
and
against
which
had
rested
the
head
of
my
bed
the
plastering
had
here
in
great
measure
resisted
the
action
of
the
fire--a
fact
which
i
attributed
to
its
having
been
recently
spread
about
this
wall
a
dense
crowd
were
collected
and
many
persons
seemed
to
be
examining
a
particular
portion
of
it
with
very
minute
and
eager
attention
the
words
â€œstrangeâ€
â€œsingularâ€
and
other
similar
expressions
excited
my
curiosity
i
approached
and
saw
as
if
graven
in
bas-relief
upon
the
white
surface
the
figure
of
a
gigantic
cat
the
impression
was
given
with
an
accuracy
truly
marvelous
there
was
a
rope
about
the
animalâ€™s
neck
when
i
first
beheld
this
apparition--for
i
could
scarcely
regard
it
as
less--my
wonder
and
my
terror
were
extreme
but
at
length
reflection
came
to
my
aid
the
cat
i
remembered
had
been
hung
in
a
garden
adjacent
to
the
house
upon
the
alarm
of
fire
this
garden
had
been
immediately
filled
by
the
crowd--by
some
one
of
whom
the
animal
must
have
been
cut
from
the
tree
and
thrown
through
an
open
window
into
my
chamber
this
had
probably
been
done
with
the
view
of
arousing
me
from
sleep
the
falling
of
other
walls
had
compressed
the
victim
of
my
cruelty
into
the
substance
of
the
freshly
spread
plaster
the
lime
of
which
with
the
flames
and
the
ammonia
from
the
carcass
had
then
accomplished
the
portraiture
as
i
saw
it
although
i
thus
readily
accounted
to
my
reason
if
not
altogether
to
my
conscience
for
the
illustration
â€œbecause
i
knew
that
it
had
loved
meâ€
startling
fact
just
detailed
it
did
not
the
less
fail
to
make
a
deep
impression
upon
my
fancy
for
months
i
could
not
rid
myself
of
the
phantasm
of
the
cat
and
during
this
period
there
came
back
into
my
spirit
a
half
sentiment
that
seemed
but
was
not
remorse
i
went
so
far
as
to
regret
the
loss
of
the
animal
and
to
look
about
me
among
the
vile
haunts
which
i
now
habitually
frequented
for
another
pet
of
the
same
species
and
of
somewhat
similar
appearance
with
which
to
supply
its
place
one
night
as
i
sat
half
stupefied
in
a
den
of
more
than
infamy
my
attention
was
suddenly
drawn
to
some
black
object
reposing
upon
the
head
of
one
of
the
immense
hogsheads
of
gin
or
of
rum
which
constituted
the
chief
furniture
of
the
apartment
i
had
been
looking
steadily
at
the
top
of
this
hogshead
for
some
minutes
and
what
now
caused
me
surprise
was
the
fact
that
i
had
not
sooner
perceived
the
object
thereupon
i
approached
it
and
touched
it
with
my
hand
it
was
a
black
cat--a
very
large
one--fully
as
large
as
pluto
and
closely
resembling
him
in
every
respect
but
only
pluto
had
not
a
white
hair
upon
any
portion
of
his
body
but
this
cat
had
a
large
although
indefinite
splotch
of
white
covering
nearly
the
whole
region
of
the
breast
upon
my
touching
him
he
immediately
arose
purred
loudly
rubbed
against
my
hand
and
appeared
delighted
with
my
notice
this
then
was
the
very
creature
of
which
i
was
in
search
i
at
once
offered
to
purchase
it
of
the
landlord
but
this
person
made
no
claim
to
it--knew
nothing
of
it--had
never
seen
it
before
i
continued
my
caresses
and
when
i
prepared
to
go
home
the
animal
evinced
a
disposition
to
accompany
me
i
permitted
it
to
do
so
occasionally
stooping
and
patting
it
as
i
proceeded
when
it
reached
the
house
it
domesticated
itself
at
once
and
became
immediately
a
great
favorite
with
my
wife
for
my
own
part
i
soon
found
a
dislike
to
it
arising
within
me
this
was
just
the
reverse
of
what
i
had
anticipated
but--i
know
not
how
or
why
it
was--its
evident
fondness
for
myself
rather
disgusted
and
annoyed
me
by
slow
degrees
these
feelings
of
disgust
and
annoyance
rose
into
the
bitterness
of
hatred
i
avoided
the
creature
a
certain
sense
of
shame
and
the
remembrance
of
my
former
deed
of
cruelty
preventing
me
from
physically
abusing
it
i
did
not
for
some
weeks
strike
or
otherwise
violently
ill
use
it
but
gradually--very
gradually--i
came
to
look
upon
it
with
unutterable
loathing
and
to
flee
silently
from
its
odious
presence
as
from
the
breath
of
a
pestilence
what
added
no
doubt
to
my
hatred
of
the
beast
was
the
discovery
on
the
morning
after
i
brought
it
home
that
like
pluto
it
also
had
been
deprived
of
one
of
its
eyes
this
circumstance
however
only
endeared
it
to
my
wife
who
as
i
have
already
said
possessed
in
a
high
degree
that
humanity
of
feeling
which
had
once
been
my
distinguishing
trait
and
the
source
of
many
of
my
simplest
and
purest
pleasures
with
my
aversion
to
this
cat
however
its
partiality
for
myself
seemed
to
increase
it
followed
my
footsteps
with
a
pertinacity
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
make
the
reader
comprehend
whenever
i
sat
it
would
crouch
beneath
my
chair
or
spring
upon
my
knees
covering
me
with
its
loathsome
caresses
if
i
arose
to
walk
it
would
get
between
my
feet
and
thus
nearly
throw
me
down
or
fastening
its
long
and
sharp
claws
in
my
dress
clamber
in
this
manner
to
my
breast
at
such
times
although
i
longed
to
destroy
it
with
a
blow
i
was
yet
withheld
from
so
doing
partly
by
a
memory
of
my
former
crime
but
chiefly--let
me
confess
it
at
once--by
absolute
dread
of
the
beast
this
dread
was
not
exactly
a
dread
of
physical
evil--and
yet
i
should
be
at
a
loss
how
otherwise
to
define
it
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
own--yes
even
in
this
felonâ€™s
cell
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
own--that
the
terror
and
horror
with
which
the
animal
inspired
me
had
been
heightened
by
one
of
the
merest
chimeras
it
would
be
possible
to
conceive
my
wife
had
called
my
attention
more
than
once
to
the
character
of
the
mark
of
white
hair
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
which
illustration
â€œthe
figure
of
a
gigantic
catâ€
constituted
the
sole
visible
difference
between
the
strange
beast
and
the
one
i
had
destroyed
the
reader
will
remember
that
this
mark
although
large
had
been
originally
very
indefinite
but
by
slow
degrees--degrees
nearly
imperceptible
and
which
for
a
long
time
my
reason
struggled
to
reject
as
fanciful--it
had
at
length
assumed
a
rigorous
distinctness
of
outline
it
was
now
the
representation
of
an
object
that
i
shudder
to
name--and
for
this
above
all
i
loathed
and
dreaded
and
would
have
rid
myself
of
the
monster
had
i
dared--it
was
now
i
say
the
image
of
a
hideous
of
a
ghastly
thing--of
the
gallows
oh
mournful
and
terrible
engine
of
horror
and
of
crime--of
agony
and
of
death
and
now
was
i
indeed
wretched
beyond
the
wretchedness
of
mere
humanity
and
a
brute
beast
whose
fellow
i
had
contemptuously
destroyed--a
brute
beast
to
work
out
for
me--for
me
a
man
fashioned
in
the
image
of
the
high
god--so
much
of
insufferable
woe
alas
neither
by
day
nor
night
knew
i
the
blessing
of
rest
any
more
during
the
former
the
creature
left
me
no
moment
alone
and
in
the
latter
i
started
hourly
from
dreams
of
unutterable
fear
to
find
the
hot
breath
of
the
thing
upon
my
face
and
its
vast
weight--an
incarnate
nightmare
that
i
had
no
power
to
shake
off--incumbent
eternally
upon
my
heart
beneath
the
pressure
of
torments
such
as
these
the
feeble
remnants
of
the
good
within
me
succumbed
evil
thoughts
became
my
sole
intimates--the
darkest
and
most
evil
of
thoughts
the
moodiness
of
my
usual
temper
increased
to
hatred
of
all
things
and
of
all
mankind
while
from
the
sudden
frequent
and
ungovernable
outbursts
of
a
fury
to
which
i
now
blindly
abandoned
myself
my
uncomplaining
wife
alas
was
the
most
usual
and
the
most
patient
of
sufferers
one
day
she
accompanied
me
upon
some
household
errand
into
the
cellar
of
the
old
building
which
our
poverty
compelled
us
to
inhabit
the
cat
followed
me
down
the
steep
stairs
and
nearly
throwing
me
headlong
exasperated
me
to
madness
uplifting
an
axe
and
forgetting
in
my
wrath
the
childish
dread
which
had
hitherto
stayed
my
hand
i
aimed
a
blow
at
the
animal
which
of
course
would
have
proved
instantly
fatal
had
it
descended
as
i
wished
but
this
blow
was
arrested
by
the
hand
of
my
wife
goaded
by
the
interference
into
a
rage
more
than
demoniacal
i
withdrew
my
arm
from
her
grasp
and
buried
the
ax
in
her
brain
she
fell
dead
upon
the
spot
without
a
groan
this
hideous
murder
accomplished
i
set
myself
forthwith
and
with
entire
deliberation
to
the
task
of
concealing
the
body
i
knew
that
i
could
not
remove
it
from
the
house
either
by
day
or
by
night
without
the
risk
of
being
observed
by
the
neighbors
many
projects
entered
my
mind
at
one
period
i
thought
of
cutting
the
corpse
into
minute
fragments
and
destroying
them
by
fire
at
another
i
resolved
to
dig
a
grave
for
it
in
the
floor
of
the
cellar
again
i
deliberated
about
casting
it
into
the
well
in
the
yard--about
packing
it
in
a
box
as
if
merchandise
with
the
usual
arrangements
and
so
getting
a
porter
to
take
it
from
the
house
finally
i
hit
upon
what
i
considered
a
far
better
expedient
than
either
of
these
i
determined
to
wall
it
up
in
the
cellar--as
the
monks
of
the
middle
ages
are
recorded
to
have
walled
up
their
victims
for
a
purpose
such
as
this
the
cellar
was
well
adapted
its
walls
were
loosely
constructed
and
had
lately
been
plastered
throughout
with
a
rough
plaster
which
the
dampness
of
the
atmosphere
had
prevented
from
hardening
moreover
in
one
of
the
walls
was
a
projection
caused
by
a
false
chimney
or
fireplace
that
had
been
filled
up
and
made
to
resemble
the
rest
of
the
cellar
i
made
no
doubt
that
i
could
readily
displace
the
bricks
at
this
point
insert
the
corpse
and
wall
the
whole
up
as
before
so
that
no
eye
could
detect
anything
suspicious
and
in
this
calculation
i
was
not
deceived
by
means
of
a
crowbar
i
easily
dislodged
the
bricks
and
having
carefully
deposited
the
body
against
the
inner
wall
i
propped
it
in
that
position
while
with
little
trouble
i
relaid
the
whole
structure
as
it
originally
stood
having
illustration
â€œan
extraordinary
catâ€
procured
mortar
sand
and
hair
with
every
possible
precaution
i
prepared
a
plaster
which
could
not
be
distinguished
from
the
old
and
with
this
i
very
carefully
went
over
the
new
brickwork
when
i
had
finished
i
felt
satisfied
that
all
was
right
the
wall
did
not
present
the
slightest
appearance
of
having
been
disturbed
the
rubbish
on
the
floor
was
picked
up
with
the
minutest
care
i
looked
around
triumphantly
and
said
to
myself
â€œhere
at
least
then
my
labor
has
not
been
in
vainâ€
my
next
step
was
to
look
for
the
beast
which
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
wretchedness
for
i
had
at
length
firmly
resolved
to
put
it
to
death
had
i
been
able
to
meet
with
it
at
the
moment
there
could
have
been
no
doubt
of
its
fate
but
it
appeared
that
the
crafty
animal
had
been
alarmed
at
the
violence
of
my
previous
anger
and
forebore
to
present
itself
in
my
present
mood
it
is
impossible
to
describe
or
to
imagine
the
deep
the
blissful
sense
of
relief
which
the
absence
of
the
detested
creature
occasioned
in
my
bosom
it
did
not
make
its
appearance
during
the
night--and
thus
for
one
night
at
least
since
its
introduction
into
the
house
i
soundly
and
tranquilly
slept--aye
slept
even
with
the
burden
of
murder
upon
my
soul
the
second
and
the
third
day
passed
and
still
my
tormentor
came
not
once
again
i
breathed
as
a
free
man
the
monster
in
terror
had
fled
the
premises
forever
i
should
behold
it
no
more
my
happiness
was
supreme
the
guilt
of
my
dark
deed
disturbed
me
but
little
some
few
inquiries
had
been
made
but
these
had
been
readily
answered
even
a
search
had
been
instituted--but
of
course
nothing
was
to
be
discovered
i
looked
upon
my
future
felicity
as
secured
upon
the
fourth
day
of
the
assassination
a
party
of
the
police
came
very
unexpectedly
into
the
house
and
proceeded
again
to
make
a
rigorous
investigation
of
the
premises
secure
however
in
the
inscrutability
of
my
place
of
concealment
i
felt
no
embarrassment
whatever
the
officers
bade
me
accompany
them
in
their
search
they
left
no
nook
or
corner
unexplored
at
length
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
they
descended
into
the
cellar
i
quivered
not
in
a
muscle
my
heart
beat
as
calmly
as
that
of
one
who
slumbers
in
innocence
i
walked
the
cellar
from
end
to
end
i
folded
my
arms
upon
my
bosom
and
roamed
easily
to
and
fro
the
police
were
thoroughly
satisfied
and
prepared
to
depart
the
glee
at
my
heart
was
too
strong
to
be
restrained
i
burned
to
say
but
one
word
by
way
of
triumph
and
to
render
doubly
sure
their
assurance
of
my
guiltlessness
â€œgentlemenâ€
i
said
at
last
as
the
party
ascended
the
steps
â€œi
delight
to
have
allayed
your
suspicions
i
wish
you
all
health
and
a
little
more
courtesy
by
the
by
gentlemen
this--this
is
a
very
well
constructed
houseâ€
in
the
rabid
desire
to
say
something
easily
i
scarcely
knew
what
i
uttered
at
all
â€œi
may
say
an
excellently
well
constructed
house
these
walls--are
you
going
gentlemen--these
walls
are
solidly
put
togetherâ€
and
here
through
the
mere
frenzy
of
bravado
i
rapped
heavily
with
a
cane
which
i
held
in
my
hand
upon
that
very
portion
of
the
brickwork
behind
which
stood
the
corpse
of
the
wife
of
my
bosom
but
may
god
shield
and
deliver
me
from
the
fangs
of
the
arch
fiend
no
sooner
had
the
reverberation
of
my
blows
sunk
into
silence
than
i
was
answered
by
a
voice
from
within
the
tomb--by
a
cry
at
first
muffled
and
broken
like
the
sobbing
of
a
child
and
then
quickly
swelling
into
one
long
loud
and
continuous
scream
utterly
anomalous
and
inhuman--a
howl--a
wailing
shriek
half
of
horror
and
half
of
triumph
such
as
might
have
arisen
only
out
of
hell
conjointly
from
the
throats
of
the
damned
in
their
agony
and
of
the
demons
that
exult
in
the
damnation
of
my
own
thoughts
it
is
folly
to
speak
swooning
i
staggered
to
the
opposite
wall
for
an
instant
the
party
upon
the
stairs
remained
motionless
through
extremity
of
terror
and
of
awe
in
the
next
a
dozen
stout
arms
were
toiling
at
the
wall
it
fell
bodily
the
corpse
already
getting
decayed
and
clotted
with
gore
stood
erect
before
the
eyes
of
the
spectators
upon
its
head
with
red
extended
mouth
and
solitary
eye
of
fire
sat
the
hideous
beast
whose
craft
had
seduced
me
into
murder
and
whose
informing
voice
had
consigned
me
to
the
hangman
i
had
walled
the
monster
up
within
the
tomb
the
flayed
hand
by
guy
de
maupassant
one
evening
about
eight
months
ago
i
met
with
some
college
comrades
at
the
lodgings
of
our
friend
louis
r
we
drank
punch
and
smoked
talked
of
literature
and
art
and
made
jokes
like
any
other
company
of
young
men
suddenly
the
door
flew
open
and
one
who
had
been
my
friend
since
boyhood
burst
in
like
a
hurricane
â€œguess
where
i
come
fromâ€
he
cried
â€œi
bet
on
the
mabilleâ€
responded
one
â€œnoâ€
said
another
â€œyou
are
too
gay
you
come
from
borrowing
money
from
burying
a
rich
uncle
or
from
pawning
your
watchâ€
â€œyou
are
getting
soberâ€
cried
a
third
â€œand
as
you
scented
the
punch
in
louisâ€™
room
you
came
up
here
to
get
drunk
againâ€
â€œyou
are
all
wrongâ€
he
replied
â€œi
come
from
p
in
normandy
where
i
have
spent
eight
days
and
whence
i
have
brought
one
of
my
friends
a
great
criminal
whom
i
ask
permission
to
present
to
youâ€
with
these
words
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
long
black
hand
from
which
the
skin
had
been
stripped
it
had
been
severed
at
the
wrist
its
dry
and
shriveled
shape
and
the
narrow
yellowed
nails
still
clinging
to
the
fingers
made
it
frightful
to
look
upon
the
muscles
which
showed
that
its
first
owner
had
been
possessed
of
great
strength
were
bound
in
place
by
a
strip
of
parchment-like
skin
â€œjust
fancyâ€
said
my
friend
â€œthe
other
day
they
sold
the
effects
of
an
old
sorcerer
recently
deceased
well
known
in
all
the
country
every
saturday
night
he
used
to
go
to
witch
gatherings
on
a
broomstick
he
practised
the
white
magic
and
the
black
gave
blue
milk
to
the
cows
and
made
them
wear
tails
like
that
of
the
companion
of
saint
anthony
the
old
scoundrel
always
had
a
deep
affection
for
this
hand
which
he
said
was
that
of
a
celebrated
criminal
executed
in
1736
for
having
thrown
his
lawful
wife
head
first
into
a
well--for
which
i
do
not
blame
him--and
then
hanging
in
the
belfry
the
priest
who
had
married
him
after
this
double
exploit
he
went
away
and
during
his
subsequent
career
which
was
brief
but
exciting
he
robbed
twelve
travelers
smoked
a
score
of
monks
in
their
monastery
and
made
a
seraglio
of
a
conventâ€
â€œbut
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
horrorâ€
we
cried
â€œeh
parbleu
i
will
make
it
the
handle
to
my
door-bell
and
frighten
my
creditorsâ€
â€œmy
friendâ€
said
henry
smith
a
big
phlegmatic
englishman
â€œi
believe
that
this
hand
is
only
a
kind
of
indian
meat
preserved
by
a
new
process
i
advise
you
to
make
bouillon
of
itâ€
â€œrail
not
messieursâ€
said
with
the
utmost
sang
froid
a
medical
student
who
was
three-quarters
drunk
â€œbut
if
you
follow
my
advice
pierre
you
will
give
this
piece
of
human
debris
christian
burial
for
fear
lest
its
owner
should
come
to
demand
it
then
too
this
hand
has
acquired
some
bad
habits
for
you
know
the
proverb
â€˜who
has
killed
will
killâ€™â€
â€œand
who
has
drank
will
drinkâ€
replied
the
host
as
he
poured
out
a
big
glass
of
punch
for
the
student
who
emptied
it
at
a
draught
and
slid
dead
drunk
under
the
table
his
sudden
dropping
out
of
the
company
was
greeted
with
a
burst
of
laughter
and
pierre
raising
his
glass
and
saluting
the
hand
cried
â€œi
drink
to
the
next
visit
of
thy
masterâ€
then
the
conversation
turned
upon
other
subjects
and
shortly
afterward
each
returned
to
his
lodgings





about
two
oâ€™clock
the
next
day
as
i
was
passing
pierreâ€™s
door
i
entered
and
found
him
reading
and
smoking
â€œwell
how
goes
itâ€
said
i
â€œvery
wellâ€
he
responded
â€œand
your
handâ€
â€œmy
hand
did
you
not
see
it
on
the
bell-pull
i
put
it
there
when
i
returned
home
last
night
but
apropos
of
this
what
do
you
think
some
idiot
doubtless
to
play
a
stupid
joke
on
me
came
ringing
at
my
door
towards
midnight
i
demanded
who
was
there
but
as
no
one
replied
i
went
back
to
bed
again
and
to
sleepâ€
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
landlord
a
fat
and
extremely
impertinent
person
entered
without
saluting
us
â€œsirâ€
said
he
â€œi
pray
you
to
take
away
immediately
that
carrion
which
you
have
hung
to
your
bell-pull
unless
you
do
this
i
shall
be
compelled
to
ask
you
to
leaveâ€
â€œsirâ€
responded
pierre
with
much
gravity
â€œyou
insult
a
hand
which
does
not
merit
it
know
you
that
it
belonged
to
a
man
of
high
breedingâ€
the
landlord
turned
on
his
heel
and
made
his
exit
without
speaking
pierre
followed
him
detached
the
hand
and
affixed
it
to
the
bell-cord
hanging
in
his
alcove
â€œthat
is
betterâ€
he
said
â€œthis
hand
like
the
â€˜brother
all
must
dieâ€™
of
the
trappists
will
give
my
thoughts
a
serious
turn
every
night
before
i
sleepâ€
at
the
end
of
an
hour
i
left
him
and
returned
to
my
own
apartment
i
slept
badly
the
following
night
was
nervous
and
agitated
and
several
times
awoke
with
a
start
once
i
imagined
even
that
a
man
had
broken
into
my
room
and
i
sprang
up
and
searched
the
closets
and
under
the
bed
towards
six
oâ€™clock
in
the
morning
i
was
commencing
to
doze
at
last
when
a
loud
knocking
at
my
door
made
me
jump
from
my
couch
it
was
my
friend
pierreâ€™s
servant
half
dressed
pale
and
trembling
â€œah
sirâ€
cried
he
sobbing
â€œmy
poor
master
someone
has
murdered
himâ€
i
dressed
myself
hastily
and
ran
to
pierreâ€™s
lodgings
the
house
was
full
of
people
disputing
together
and
everything
was
in
a
commotion
everyone
was
talking
at
the
same
time
recounting
and
commenting
on
the
occurrence
in
all
sorts
of
ways
with
great
difficulty
i
reached
the
bedroom
made
myself
known
to
those
guarding
the
door
and
was
permitted
to
enter
four
agents
of
police
were
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
apartment
pencils
in
hand
examining
every
detail
conferring
in
low
voices
and
writing
from
time
to
time
in
their
note-books
two
doctors
were
in
consultation
by
the
bed
on
which
lay
the
unconscious
form
of
pierre
he
was
not
dead
but
his
face
was
fixed
in
an
expression
of
the
most
awful
terror
his
eyes
were
open
their
widest
and
the
dilated
pupils
seemed
to
regard
fixedly
with
unspeakable
horror
something
unknown
and
frightful
his
hands
were
clinched
i
raised
the
quilt
which
covered
his
body
from
the
chin
downward
and
saw
on
his
neck
deeply
sunk
in
the
flesh
the
marks
of
fingers
some
drops
of
blood
spotted
his
shirt
at
that
moment
one
thing
struck
me
i
chanced
to
notice
that
the
shriveled
hand
was
no
longer
attached
to
the
bell-cord
the
doctors
had
doubtless
removed
it
to
avoid
the
comments
of
those
entering
the
chamber
where
the
wounded
man
lay
because
the
appearance
of
this
hand
was
indeed
frightful
i
did
not
inquire
what
had
become
of
it
i
now
clip
from
a
newspaper
of
the
next
day
the
story
of
the
crime
with
all
the
details
that
the
police
were
able
to
procure
â€œa
frightful
attempt
was
made
yesterday
on
the
life
of
young
m
pierre
b
student
who
belongs
to
one
of
the
best
families
in
normandy
he
returned
home
about
ten
oâ€™clock
in
the
evening
and
excused
his
valet
bouvin
from
further
attendance
upon
him
saying
that
he
felt
fatigued
and
was
going
to
bed
towards
midnight
bouvin
was
suddenly
awakened
by
the
furious
ringing
of
his
masterâ€™s
bell
he
was
afraid
and
lighted
a
lamp
and
waited
the
bell
was
silent
about
a
minute
then
rang
again
with
such
vehemence
that
the
domestic
mad
with
fright
flew
from
his
room
to
awaken
the
concierge
who
ran
to
summon
the
police
and
at
the
end
of
about
fifteen
minutes
two
policemen
forced
open
the
door
a
horrible
sight
met
their
eyes
the
furniture
was
overturned
giving
evidence
of
a
fearful
struggle
between
the
victim
and
his
assailant
in
the
middle
of
the
room
upon
his
back
his
body
rigid
with
livid
face
and
frightfully
dilated
eyes
lay
motionless
young
pierre
b
bearing
upon
his
neck
the
deep
imprints
of
five
fingers
dr
bourdean
was
called
immediately
and
his
report
says
that
the
aggressor
must
have
been
possessed
of
prodigious
strength
and
have
had
an
extraordinarily
thin
and
sinewy
hand
because
the
fingers
left
in
the
flesh
of
the
victim
five
holes
like
those
from
a
pistol
ball
and
had
penetrated
until
they
almost
met
there
is
no
clue
to
the
motive
of
the
crime
or
to
its
perpetrator
the
police
are
making
a
thorough
investigationâ€
the
following
appeared
in
the
same
newspaper
next
day
â€œm
pierre
b
the
victim
of
the
frightful
assault
of
which
we
published
an
account
yesterday
has
regained
consciousness
after
two
hours
of
the
most
assiduous
care
by
dr
bourdean
his
life
is
not
in
danger
but
it
is
strongly
feared
that
he
has
lost
his
reason
no
trace
has
been
found
of
his
assailantâ€
my
poor
friend
was
indeed
insane
for
seven
months
i
visited
him
daily
at
the
hospital
where
we
had
placed
him
but
he
did
not
recover
the
light
of
reason
in
his
delirium
strange
words
escaped
him
and
like
all
madmen
he
had
one
fixed
idea
he
believed
himself
continually
pursued
by
a
specter
one
day
they
came
for
me
in
haste
saying
he
was
worse
and
when
i
arrived
i
found
him
dying
for
two
hours
he
remained
very
calm
then
suddenly
rising
from
his
bed
in
spite
of
our
efforts
he
cried
waving
his
arms
as
if
a
prey
to
the
most
awful
terror
â€œtake
it
away
take
it
away
it
strangles
me
help
helpâ€
twice
he
made
the
circuit
of
the
room
uttering
horrible
screams
then
fell
face
downward
dead





as
he
was
an
orphan
i
was
charged
to
take
his
body
to
the
little
village
of
p
in
normandy
where
his
parents
were
buried
it
was
the
place
from
which
he
had
arrived
the
evening
he
found
us
drinking
punch
in
louis
râ€™s
room
when
he
had
presented
to
us
the
flayed
hand
his
body
was
inclosed
in
a
leaden
coffin
and
four
days
afterwards
i
walked
sadly
beside
the
old
cure
who
had
given
him
his
first
lessons
to
the
little
cemetery
where
they
dug
his
grave
it
was
a
beautiful
day
and
sunshine
from
a
cloudless
sky
flooded
the
earth
birds
sang
from
the
blackberry
bushes
where
many
a
time
when
we
were
children
we
had
stolen
to
eat
the
fruit
again
i
saw
pierre
and
myself
creeping
along
behind
the
hedge
and
slipping
through
the
gap
that
we
knew
so
well
down
at
the
end
of
the
little
plot
where
they
bury
the
poor
again
we
would
return
to
the
house
with
cheeks
and
lips
black
with
the
juice
of
the
berries
we
had
eaten
i
looked
at
the
bushes
they
were
covered
with
fruit
mechanically
i
picked
some
and
bore
it
to
my
mouth
the
cure
had
opened
his
breviary
and
was
muttering
his
prayers
in
a
low
voice
i
heard
at
the
end
of
the
walk
the
spades
of
the
grave-diggers
who
were
opening
the
tomb
suddenly
they
called
out
the
cure
closed
his
book
and
we
went
to
see
what
they
wished
of
us
they
had
found
a
coffin
in
digging
a
stroke
of
the
pickaxe
had
started
the
cover
and
we
perceived
within
a
skeleton
of
unusual
stature
lying
on
its
back
its
hollow
eyes
seeming
yet
to
menace
and
defy
us
i
was
troubled
i
know
not
why
and
almost
afraid
â€œholdâ€
cried
one
of
the
men
â€œlook
there
one
of
the
rascalâ€™s
hands
has
been
severed
at
the
wrist
ah
here
it
isâ€
and
he
picked
up
from
beside
the
body
a
huge
withered
hand
and
held
it
out
to
us
â€œseeâ€
cried
the
other
laughing
â€œsee
how
he
glares
at
you
as
if
he
would
spring
at
your
throat
to
make
you
give
him
back
his
handâ€
â€œgoâ€
said
the
cure
â€œleave
the
dead
in
peace
and
close
the
coffin
we
will
make
poor
pierreâ€™s
grave
elsewhereâ€
the
next
day
all
was
finished
and
i
returned
to
paris
after
having
left
fifty
francs
with
the
old
cure
for
masses
to
be
said
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
him
whose
sepulchre
we
had
troubled
the
vengeance
of
a
tree
by
eleanor
f
lewis
through
the
windows
of
jim
dalyâ€™s
saloon
in
the
little
town
of
c----
the
setting
sun
streamed
in
yellow
patches
lighting
up
the
glasses
scattered
on
the
tables
and
the
faces
of
several
men
who
were
gathered
near
the
bar
farmers
mostly
they
were
with
a
sprinkling
of
shopkeepers
while
prominent
among
them
was
the
village
editor
and
all
were
discussing
a
startling
piece
of
news
that
had
spread
through
the
town
and
its
surroundings
the
tidings
that
walter
stedman
a
laborer
on
albert
kelseyâ€™s
ranch
had
assaulted
and
murdered
his
employerâ€™s
daughter
had
reached
them
and
had
spread
universal
horror
among
the
people
a
farmer
declared
that
he
had
seen
the
deed
committed
as
he
walked
through
a
neighboring
lane
and
having
always
been
noted
for
his
cowardice
instead
of
running
to
the
girlâ€™s
aid
had
hailed
a
party
of
miners
who
were
returning
from
their
mid-day
meal
through
a
field
near
by
when
they
reached
the
spot
however
where
stedman
as
they
supposed
had
done
his
black
deed
only
the
girl
lay
there
in
the
stillness
of
death
her
murderer
had
taken
the
opportunity
to
fly
the
party
had
searched
the
woods
of
the
kelsey
estate
and
just
as
they
were
nearing
the
house
itself
the
appearance
of
walter
stedman
walking
in
a
strangely
unsteady
manner
toward
it
made
them
quicken
their
pace
he
was
soon
in
custody
although
he
had
protested
his
innocence
of
the
crime
he
said
that
he
had
just
seen
the
body
himself
on
his
way
to
the
station
and
that
when
they
had
found
him
he
was
going
to
the
house
for
help
but
they
had
laughed
at
his
story
and
had
flung
him
into
the
tiny
stifling
calaboose
of
the
town
what
were
their
proofs
walter
stedman
a
young
fellow
of
about
twenty-six
had
come
from
the
city
to
their
quiet
town
just
when
times
were
at
their
hardest
in
search
of
work
the
most
of
the
men
living
in
the
town
were
honest
fellows
doing
their
work
faithfully
when
they
could
get
it
and
when
they
had
socially
asked
stedman
to
have
a
drink
with
them
he
had
refused
in
rather
a
scornful
manner
â€œthat
infernal
city
chapâ€
he
was
called
and
their
hate
and
envy
increased
in
strength
when
albert
kelsey
had
employed
him
in
preference
to
any
of
themselves
as
time
went
on
the
story
of
stedmanâ€™s
admiration
for
margaret
kelsey
had
gone
afloat
with
the
added
information
that
his
employerâ€™s
daughter
had
repulsed
him
saying
that
she
would
not
marry
a
common
laborer
so
stedman
when
this
news
reached
his
employerâ€™s
ears
was
discharged
and
this
then
was
his
revenge
for
them
these
proofs
were
sufficient
to
pronounce
him
guilty
yet
that
afternoon
as
stedman
crouched
on
the
floor
of
the
calaboose
grew
hopeless
in
the
knowledge
that
no
one
would
believe
his
story
and
that
his
undeserved
punishment
would
be
swift
and
sure
a
tramp
boarding
a
freight
car
several
miles
from
the
town
sped
away
from
the
spot
where
his
crime
had
been
committed
and
knew
that
forever
its
shadow
would
follow
him
from
the
tiny
window
of
his
prison
walter
stedman
could
see
the
red
glow
of
the
heavens
that
betokened
the
setting
of
the
sun
so
the
red
sun
of
his
life
was
soon
to
set
a
life
that
had
been
innocent
of
all
crime
and
that
now
was
to
be
ended
for
a
deed
that
he
had
never
committed
most
prominent
of
all
the
visions
that
swept
through
his
mind
was
that
of
margaret
kelsey
lying
as
he
had
first
found
her
fresh
from
the
hands
of
her
murderer
but
there
was
another
of
a
more
tender
nature
how
long
he
and
margaret
had
tried
to
keep
their
secret
until
walter
could
be
promoted
to
a
higher
position
so
that
he
could
ask
for
her
hand
with
no
fear
of
the
fatherâ€™s
antagonism
then
came
the
remembrance
of
an
afternoon
meeting
between
the
two
in
the
woods
of
the
kelsey
estate--how
just
as
they
were
parting
walter
had
heard
footsteps
near
them
and
glancing
sharply
around
saw
an
evil
scowling
murderous
face
peering
through
the
brush
he
had
started
toward
it
but
the
owner
of
the
countenance
had
taken
himself
hurriedly
off
the
gossiping
townspeople
had
misconstrued
this
romance
and
when
albert
kelsey
had
heard
of
this
clandestine
meeting
from
the
man
who
was
later
on
to
appear
as
a
leader
of
the
mob
and
that
he
had
discharged
stedman
they
had
believed
that
the
young
man
had
formally
proposed
and
had
been
rejected
but
justice
had
gone
wrong
as
it
had
done
innumerable
times
before
and
will
again
an
innocent
man
was
to
be
hanged
even
without
the
comfort
of
a
trial
while
the
man
who
was
guilty
was
free
to
wander
where
he
would
that
autumn
night
the
darkness
came
quickly
and
only
the
stars
did
their
best
to
light
the
scene
a
body
of
men
all
masked
and
having
as
a
leader
one
who
had
ever
since
stedmanâ€™s
arrival
in
town
cherished
a
secret
hatred
of
the
young
man
dragged
stedman
from
the
calaboose
and
tramped
through
the
town
defying
all
defying
even
god
himself
along
the
highway
and
into
farmer
brownâ€™s
â€œcross
cutâ€
they
went
vigilantly
guarding
their
prisoner
who
with
the
lanterns
lighting
up
his
haggard
face
walked
among
them
with
the
lagging
step
of
utter
hopelessness
â€œthatâ€™s
a
good
treeâ€
their
leader
said
presently
stopping
and
pointing
out
a
spreading
oak
when
the
slipknot
was
adjusted
and
stedman
had
stepped
on
the
box
he
added
â€œif
youâ€™ve
got
anything
to
say
youâ€™d
better
say
it
nowâ€
â€œi
am
innocent
i
swear
before
godâ€
the
doomed
man
answered
â€œi
never
took
the
life
of
margaret
kelseyâ€
â€œgive
us
your
proofâ€
jeered
the
leader
and
when
stedman
kept
a
despairing
silence
he
laughed
shortly
â€œready
menâ€
he
gave
the
order
the
box
was
kicked
aside
and
then--only
a
writhing
body
swung
to
and
fro
in
the
gloom
in
front
of
the
men
stood
their
leader
watching
the
contortions
of
the
body
with
silent
glee
â€œiâ€™ll
tell
you
a
secret
boysâ€
he
said
suddenly
â€œi
was
after
that
poor
murdered
girl
myself
a
d----
little
chance
i
had
but
by
----
he
had
just
as
littleâ€
a
pause--then
â€œheâ€™s
shunted
this
earth
cut
him
down
you
fellowsâ€





â€œitâ€™s
no
use
son
iâ€™ll
give
up
the
blasted
thing
as
a
bad
job
thereâ€™s
something
queer
about
that
there
tree
do
you
see
how
its
branches
balance
it
we
have
cut
the
trunk
nearly
in
two
but
it
wonâ€™t
come
down
thereâ€™s
plenty
of
others
around
weâ€™ll
take
one
of
them
if
iâ€™d
a
long
rope
with
me
iâ€™d
get
that
tree
down
and
yet
the
way
the
thing
stands
it
would
be
risking
a
fellowâ€™s
life
to
climb
it
itâ€™s
got
the
devil
in
it
sureâ€
so
old
farmer
brown
shouldered
his
axe
and
made
for
another
tree
his
son
following
they
had
sawed
and
chopped
and
chopped
and
sawed
and
yet
the
tall
white
oak
with
its
branches
jutting
out
almost
as
regularly
as
if
done
by
the
work
of
a
machine
stood
straight
and
firm
farmer
brown
well
known
for
his
weak
cowardly
spirit
who
in
beholding
the
murder
of
albert
kelseyâ€™s
daughter
had
in
his
fright
mistaken
the
criminal
now
in
his
superstition
let
the
oak
stand
because
its
well-balanced
position
saved
it
from
falling
when
other
trees
would
have
been
down
and
so
this
tree
the
same
one
to
which
an
innocent
man
had
been
hanged
was
left--for
other
work
it
was
a
bleak
rainy
night--such
a
night
as
can
be
found
only
in
central
california
the
wind
howled
like
a
thousand
demons
and
lashed
the
trees
together
in
wild
embraces
now
and
then
the
weird
â€œhoot
hootâ€
of
an
owl
came
softly
from
the
distance
in
the
lulls
of
the
storm
while
the
barking
of
coyotes
woke
the
echoes
of
the
hills
into
sounds
like
fiendish
laughter
in
the
wind
and
rain
a
man
fought
his
path
through
the
bush
and
into
farmer
brownâ€™s
â€œcross
cutâ€
as
the
shortest
way
home
suddenly
he
stopped
trembling
as
if
held
by
some
unseen
impulse
before
him
rose
the
white
oak
wavering
and
swaying
in
the
storm
â€œgood
god
itâ€™s
the
tree
i
swung
stedman
fromâ€
he
cried
and
a
strange
fear
thrilled
him
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
it
held
by
some
undefinable
fascination
yes
there
on
one
of
the
longest
branches
a
small
piece
of
rope
still
dangled
and
then
to
the
murdererâ€™s
excited
vision
this
rope
seemed
to
lengthen
to
form
at
the
end
into
a
slipknot
a
knot
that
encircled
a
purple
neck
while
below
it
writhed
and
swayed
the
body
of
a
man
â€œdamn
himâ€
he
muttered
starting
toward
the
hanging
form
as
if
about
to
help
the
rope
in
its
work
of
strangulation
â€œwill
he
forever
follow
me
and
yet
he
deserved
it
the
black-hearted
villain
he
took
her
life----â€
he
never
finished
the
sentence
the
white
oak
towering
above
him
in
its
strength
seemed
to
grow
like
a
frenzied
living
creature
there
was
a
sudden
splitting
sound
then
came
a
crash
and
under
the
fallen
tree
lay
stedmanâ€™s
murderer
crushed
and
mangled
from
between
the
broken
trunk
and
the
stump
that
was
left
a
gray
dim
shape
sprang
out
and
sped
past
the
manâ€™s
still
form
away
into
the
wild
blackness
of
the
night
the
parlor-car
ghost
all
draped
with
blue
denim--the
seaside
cottage
of
my
friend
sara
pyne
she
asked
me
to
go
there
with
her
when
she
opened
it
to
have
it
set
in
order
for
the
summer
she
confessed
that
she
felt
a
trifle
nervous
at
the
idea
of
entering
it
alone
and
i
am
always
ready
for
an
excursion
so
much
blue
denim
rather
surprised
me
because
blue
is
not
complimentary
to
saraâ€™s
complexion--she
always
wears
some
shade
of
red
by
preference
she
perceived
my
wonder
she
is
very
near-sighted
and
therefore
sees
everything
by
some
sort
of
sixth
sense
â€œyou
do
not
like
my
portieres
and
curtains
and
table-coversâ€
said
she
â€œneither
do
i
but
i
did
it
to
accommodate
and
now
he
rests
well
in
his
grave
i
hopeâ€
â€œwhose
grave
for
pityâ€™s
sakeâ€
â€œmr
j
billington
priceâ€™sâ€
â€œand
who
is
he
he
doesnâ€™t
sound
interestingâ€
â€œthen
i
will
tell
you
about
himâ€
said
sara
taking
a
seat
directly
in
front
of
one
of
those
curtains
â€œlast
autumn
i
was
leaving
this
place
for
new
york
traveling
on
the
fast
express
train
known
as
the
flying
yankee
of
course
i
thought
of
the
flying
dutchman
and
wagnerâ€™s
musical
setting
of
the
uncanny
legend
and
how
different
things
are
in
these
days
of
steam
etc
then
i
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
landscape
the
horizon
that
seemed
to
wheel
in
a
great
curve
as
the
train
sped
on
every
now
and
then
i
had
an
impression
at
the
â€˜tail
of
the
eyeâ€™
that
a
man
was
sitting
in
a
chair
three
or
four
numbers
in
front
of
me
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
car
each
time
that
i
saw
this
shape
i
looked
at
the
chair
and
ascertained
that
it
was
unoccupied
but
it
was
an
odd
trick
of
vision
i
raised
my
lorgnette
and
the
chair
showed
emptier
than
before
there
was
nobody
in
it
certainly
but
the
more
i
knew
that
it
was
vacant
the
more
plainly
i
saw
the
man
always
with
the
corner
of
my
eye
it
made
me
nervous
when
passengers
entered
the
car
i
dreaded
lest
they
might
take
that
seat
what
would
happen
if
they
should
a
bag
was
put
in
the
chair--that
made
me
uncomfortable
the
bag
was
removed
at
the
next
station
then
a
baby
was
placed
in
the
seat
it
began
to
laugh
as
though
someone
had
gently
tickled
it
there
was
something
odd
about
that
chair--thirteen
was
its
number
when
i
looked
away
from
it
the
impression
was
strong
upon
me
that
some
person
sitting
there
was
watching
me
â€œreally
it
would
not
do
to
humor
such
fancies
so
i
touched
the
electric
button
asked
the
porter
to
bring
me
a
table
and
taking
from
my
bag
a
pack
of
cards
proceeded
to
divert
myself
with
a
game
of
patience
i
was
puzzling
where
to
put
a
seven
of
spades
â€˜where
can
it
goâ€™
i
murmured
to
myself
a
voice
behind
me
prompted
â€˜play
the
four
of
diamonds
on
the
five
and
you
can
do
itâ€™
i
started
the
only
occupants
of
the
car
besides
me
were
a
bridal
couple
a
mother
with
three
little
children
and
a
typical
preacher
of
one
of
the
straitest
sects
who
had
spoken
â€˜play
up
the
four
madamâ€™
repeated
this
voice
â€œi
looked
fearfully
over
my
shoulder
at
first
i
saw
a
bluish
cloud
like
cigar
smoke
but
inodorous
then
the
vision
cleared
and
i
saw
a
young
man
whom
i
knew
by
a
subtle
intuition
to
be
the
occupant
seen
and
not
seen
of
chair
number
thirteen
evidently
he
was
a
traveling
salesman--and
a
ghost
of
course
a
drummerâ€™s
ghost
sounds
ridiculous--theyâ€™re
so
extremely
alive
or
else
you
would
expect
a
dead
drummer
to
be
particularly
dead
and
not
â€˜walkâ€™
this
was
a
most
commonplace-looking
ghost
cordial
pushing
businesslike
at
the
same
time
his
face
had
an
expression
of
utter
despair
and
horror
which
made
him
still
more
preposterous
of
course
it
is
not
nice
to
let
a
stranger
speak
to
one
even
on
so
impersonal
a
topic
as
a
four
of
diamonds
but
a
ghost--there
canâ€™t
be
any
rule
of
etiquette
about
talking
with
a
ghost
my
dear
it
was
dreadful
that
forward
creature
showed
me
how
to
play
all
the
cards
and
then
begged
me
to
lay
them
out
again
in
order
that
he
might
give
me
some
clever
points
i
was
too
much
amazed
and
disturbed
to
speak
i
could
only
place
the
cards
at
his
suggestion
this
i
did
so
as
not
to
appear
to
be
listening
to
the
empty
air
and
be
supposed
to
be
a
crazy
woman
presently
the
ghost
spoke
again
and
told
me
his
story
â€œâ€˜madamâ€™
he
said
â€˜i
have
been
riding
back
and
forth
on
this
car
ever
since
february
22
189--
seven
months
and
eleven
days
all
this
time
i
have
not
exchanged
a
word
with
anyone
for
a
drummer
that
is
pretty
hard
you
may
believe
you
know
the
story
of
the
flying
dutchman
well
that
is
very
nearly
my
case
a
curse
is
upon
me
and
will
not
be
removed
until
some
kind
soul----
but
iâ€™m
getting
ahead
of
my
text
that
day
there
were
four
of
us
traveling
for
different
houses
one
of
the
boys
was
in
wool
one
in
baking
powder
one
in
boots
and
shoes
and
myself
in
cotton
goods
we
met
on
the
road
took
seats
together
and
fell
into
talking
shop
â€œâ€˜those
fellows
told
big
lies
about
their
sales
washingtonâ€™s
birthday
though
it
was
the
baking
powder
man
raised
the
amount
of
the
bills
of
goods
which
he
had
sold
better
than
a
whole
can
of
his
stuff
could
have
done
i
admitted
the
straight
truth
that
i
had
not
yet
been
able
to
make
a
sale
and
then
i
swore--not
in
a
light-minded
chipper
style
of
verbal
trimmings
but
a
great
round
heaven-defying
oath--that
i
would
sell
a
case
of
blue
denims
on
that
trip
if
it
took
me
forever
we
became
dry
with
talk
and
when
the
train
stopped
at
rivermouth
we
went
out
to
have
some
beer
it
is
good
there
you
know--pardon
me
i
forgot
that
i
was
speaking
to
a
lady
well
we
had
to
run
to
get
aboard
i
missed
my
footing
fell
under
the
wheels
and
the
next
thing
that
i
knew
they
were
holding
an
inquest
over
my
remains
while
i
disemboweled
was
sitting
on
a
corner
of
the
undertakerâ€™s
table
wondering
which
of
the
coronerâ€™s
jury
was
likely
to
want
a
case
of
blue
denims
â€œâ€˜then
i
remembered
my
wicked
oath
and
understood
that
i
was
a
soul
doomed
to
wander
until
i
could
succeed
in
selling
that
bill
of
goods
i
spoke
once
or
twice
offering
the
denims
under
value
but
nobody
noticed
me
verdict
accidental
death
negligence
of
deceased
railroad
corporation
not
to
blame
deceased
got
out
for
beer
at
his
own
risk
the
other
drummers
took
charge
of
the
remains
and
wrote
a
beautiful
letter
to
my
relatives
about
my
social
qualities
and
my
impressive
conversation
i
wish
it
had
been
less
impressive
that
time
i
might
have
lied
about
my
sales
or
i
might
have
said
that
i
hoped
for
better
luck
but
after
that
oath
there
was
nothing
for
it
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
on
this
road
in
chair
number
thirteen
to
all
eternity
nobody
suspects
my
presence
they
sit
on
my
knees--iâ€™m
playing
in
luck
when
it
is
a
nice
baby
as
it
was
this
afternoon
they
pile
wraps
bags
even
railway
literature
on
me
they
play
cards
under
my
nose--and
what
duffers
some
of
them
are
you
madam
are
the
first
person
who
has
perceived
me
and
therefore
i
ventured
to
speak
to
you
meaning
no
offense
i
can
see
that
you
are
sorry
for
me
now
if
you
recall
the
story
of
the
flying
dutchman
he
was
saved
by
the
charity
of
a
good
woman
in
fact
senta
married
him
now
iâ€™m
not
asking
anything
of
that
size
i
see
that
you
wear
a
wedding
ring
and
no
doubt
you
make
some
manâ€™s
happiness
i
wasnâ€™t
a
marrying
man
myself
and
naturally
am
not
a
marrying
ghost
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
anyway
but
if
you
could--i
donâ€™t
suppose
you
would
have
any
use
for
them--but
if
you
were
disposed
to
do
a
turn
of
good
solid
christian
charity--i
should
be
everlastingly
grateful
and
you
may
have
that
case
of
denims
at
7250
and
that
quality
is
quoted
to-day
at
80
does
it
go
madamâ€™
â€œthe
speech
of
the
poor
ghost
was
not
very
eloquent
but
his
eyes
had
an
intense
eager
glare
which
was
terrible
something--pity
fear
i
do
not
know
what--compelled
me
i
decided
to
do
without
that
white
and
gold
evening
cloak
instead
i
gave
7250
to
the
ghost
and
took
from
him
a
receipt
for
the
sum
signed
j
billington
price
then
he
smiled
contentedly
thanked
me
with
emotion
and
returned
to
chair
number
thirteen
several
times
on
the
journey
although
i
did
not
perceive
him
again
i
felt
dazed
when
the
train
arrived
at
new
york
and
i
with
the
other
passengers
dismounted
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
strong
hand
passed
under
my
elbow
steadying
me
down
the
steps
as
i
walked
the
length
of
the
station
my
bag--not
heavy
at
any
time--appeared
to
become
weightless
i
believe
that
the
parlor-car
ghost
walked
beside
me
carrying
the
bag
whose
handle
still
remained
in
my
other
hand
indeed
once
or
twice
i
thought
i
felt
the
touch
of
cold
fingers
against
mine
since
then
i
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
poor
ghost
is
not
at
rest
i
hope
he
is
â€œbut
i
never
expected
nor
wished
for
the
blue
denims
the
next
day
however
a
dray
belonging
to
a
great
wholesale
house
backed
up
to
our
door
and
delivered
a
case
of
denims
with
a
receipted
bill
for
the
same
what
was
i
to
do
i
could
not
go
about
selling
blue
denims
i
could
not
give
them
away
without
exciting
comment
so
i
furnished
the
cottage
with
them--and
you
know
the
effect
on
my
complexion
pity
me
dear
and
credit
me
frivolous
woman
as
i
am
with
having
saved
a
soul
at
the
expense
of
my
own
vanity
my
story
is
told
what
do
you
think
about
itâ€
ghost
of
buckstown
inn
by
arnold
m
anderson
several
travel-worn
drummers
sat
in
the
lobby
exchanging
yarns
it
was
rodney
greenâ€™s
turn
and
he
looked
wise
and
began
his
tale
â€œi
donâ€™t
claim
by
any
means
that
the
belief
in
ghosts
is
a
general
thing
in
arkansas
but
i
do
say
that
i
had
an
experience
out
there
a
few
years
ago
â€œit
was
late
in
the
fall
and
i
happened
to
be
in
the
village
of
buckstown
which
desecrates
a
very
limited
portion
of
the
state
the
town
is
about
as
small
and
dirty
a
place
as
ever
i
saw
and
the
buckstown
inn
is
not
much
above
the
general
character
of
the
place
the
region
is
inhabited
by
natives
who
still
cling
to
all
sorts
of
foolish
superstitions
the
inn
in
the
ante-bellum
days
was
kept
by
one
who
was
said
to
be
the
meanest
and
most
crabbed
of
mortals
the
old
demon
was
as
miserly
as
he
was
mean
and
all
his
narrow
life
he
hoarded
his
filthy
lucre
with
fiendish
greed
report
had
it
also
that
he
had
even
murdered
his
patrons
in
their
beds
for
their
money
what
the
facts
actually
were
i
donâ€™t
know
but
even
to
this
day
the
old
inn
is
held
in
suspicion
a
lingering
effect
of
former
horrors
still
clouds
its
memory
â€œthe
present
proprietor
bunk
watson--his
real
name
is
bunker
i
believe--is
an
altogether
different
sort
of
chap--a
southern
type
in
fact--one
of
those
shiftless
heedless
happy-go-lucky
mortals
who
loves
strong
whiskey
and
who
chews
an
enormous
quid
of
black
tobacco
and
smokes
a
corncob
pipe
at
the
same
time
â€œwhen
the
former
keeper
â€˜shuffled
offâ€™
his
property
fell
to
a
distant
relative
the
present
keeper
who
with
his
family
immediately
moved
in
from
a
neighboring
hamlet
and
took
possession
it
was
well
known
that
the
old
proprietor
had
accumulated
considerable
wealth
during
his
sojourn
among
the
living
but
all
efforts
to
discover
any
treasure
upon
the
premises
had
failed
and
now
the
idea
of
ever
finding
it
was
practically
given
up
as
far
as
bunk
was
concerned
the
matter
troubled
him
little
he
had
a
hard-working
wife
who
ran
things
the
best
she
could
under
the
circumstances
and
saw
that
his
meals
were
forthcoming
at
their
respective
intervals
what
more
could
he
wish
why
should
he
care
if
there
was
a
treasure
buried
upon
his
place
indeed
it
would
have
been
a
sore
puzzle
for
him
to
know
what
to
do
with
a
fortune
unless
perhaps
his
wife
came
to
his
aid
â€œamong
the
stories
that
hovered
in
the
history
of
the
buckstown
inn
was
one
which
involved
a
ghost
in
the
room
where
the
former
keeper
had
died
peculiar
noises
were
heard
at
unearthly
hours
sighing
moaning
and
in
fact
all
the
other
indications
which
point
to
the
existence
of
ghosts
were
said
to
be
present
on
account
of
this
the
chamber
had
long
since
been
abandoned
â€œi
listened
with
keen
interest
to
the
wonderful
tales
about
the
haunted
room
and
then
suddenly
resolved
to
investigate--to
sleep
in
that
chamber
that
very
night
and
see
for
myself
all
that
was
to
be
seen
i
told
buck
of
my
purpose
he
shook
his
head
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
instead
of
warning
me
and
offering
a
flood
of
protests
as
i
expected
he
merely
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
let
fly
a
quart
or
so
of
yellowish
juice
from
between
a
pair
of
brown-stained
lips
and
opening
one
corner
of
his
wide
mouth
lazily
called
out
â€˜janeâ€™
his
wife
appeared
and
he
intimated
that
i
should
settle
the
matter
with
the
â€˜old
womanâ€™
the
prospect
of
a
fee
persuaded
the
wife
and
off
she
went
to
arrange
for
my
bed
in
that
ill-fated
room
â€œat
nine
oâ€™clock
that
evening
i
bid
the
family
good-night
took
my
candle
ascended
the
rickety
stairs
and
entered
the
chamber
of
horrors
the
atmosphere
was
heavy
and
had
a
peculiar
odor
that
was
not
at
all
pleasing
however
i
latched
the
door
and
was
soon
in
bed
having
propped
myself
up
with
pillows
i
was
prepared
to
await
the
coming
of
the
ghost
â€œoverhead
the
dusty
rafters
which
once
had
experienced
the
sensation
of
being
whitewashed
but
which
were
now
a
dirty
yellowish
color
were
hung
with
a
fantastic
array
of
cobwebs
the
flickering
light
of
the
candle
reflected
upon
the
walls
and
against
the
ceiling
a
pyramid
of
grotesque
shapes
and
with
this
effect
being
continually
disturbed
by
the
swaying
cobwebs
the
whole
caused
the
room
to
appear
rather
ghostly
after
all
and
especially
so
to
an
imaginative
mind
â€œi
waited
and
waited
for
hours
it
seemed
but
still
no
ghost
perhaps
it
was
afraid
of
my
candle
light
so
i
blew
it
out
no
sooner
had
i
done
this
and
settled
back
in
bed
again
than
a
white
hand
appeared
through
the
door
then
a
whole
figure--at
last
the
ghost
had
come
a
white
and
sheeted
ghost
â€œit
had
come
right
through
the
door
although
it
was
locked
and
now
it
advanced
toward
the
bed
raising
its
long
white
arm
it
pointed
a
bony
finger
at
me
and
then
commanded
â€˜come
with
meâ€™
thereupon
it
turned
to
the
door
while
instantly
i
jumped
out
of
bed
to
follow
some
unseen
power
compelled
me
to
obey
the
door
flew
open
and
the
ghost
led
me
down
the
stairs
through
long
halls
into
the
cellar
through
mysterious
underground
corridors
upstairs
again
in
and
out
rooms
which
i
never
dreamed
were
to
be
found
in
that
old
rambling
inn
finally
through
a
small
door
in
the
rear
we
left
the
house
i
was
in
my
sleeping
garments
but
no
matter
i
had
to
follow
â€œthe
white
form
with
a
slow
and
measured
tread
and
as
silent
as
death
led
the
way
into
the
orchard
there
under
a
tree
at
the
farther
end
it
pointed
to
the
ground
and
in
the
same
ghostly
tones
before
used
said
â€œâ€˜here
you
will
find
a
great
treasure
buriedâ€™
â€œthe
ghost
then
disappeared
and
i
saw
it
no
more
i
stood
dazed
and
trembling
upon
recovering
my
wits
i
started
to
dig
but
the
chill
of
the
night
air
and
the
scantiness
of
my
night
robes
made
such
labor
impracticable
so
i
decided
to
leave
some
mark
to
identify
the
place
and
come
around
again
at
daybreak
i
reached
up
and
broke
off
a
limb
overcome
with
my
nightâ€™s
exertions
i
slept
the
next
morning
until
a
loud
rapping
on
my
door
and
a
croaking
voice
warned
me
that
it
was
noon
â€œi
had
intended
to
leave
buckstown
inn
that
day
but
prompted
by
curiosity
and
anxious
to
investigate
i
unpacked
my
gripsack
for
a
comfortable
stay
â€œyou
must
understand
that
this
was
my
first
experience
with
a
ghost
and
i
feared
i
might
never
see
another
â€œat
breakfast
my
landlady
waited
on
me
in
silence
though
once
i
detected
her
eyes
following
me
with
a
peculiar
expression
she
wanted
to
ask
me
how
i
enjoyed
the
night
but
i
would
not
gratify
her
by
volunteering
a
word
â€œmy
host
was
more
outspoken
â€œâ€˜reckon
ye
didnâ€™t
get
much
sleepâ€™
said
he
with
a
queer
smile
â€œâ€˜did
you
hear
anythingâ€™
i
asked
â€œâ€˜well
i
did--ye-esâ€™
he
said
with
a
drawl
â€˜but
ye
didnâ€™t
disturb
me
any
i
knew
yeâ€™d
hev
trouble
when
ye
went
in
thet
room
ter
sleepâ€™
â€œthat
afternoon
i
slipped
out
to
the
tree
but
to
my
amazement
i
found
that
the
twig
i
had
broken
from
the
branches
was
gone
finally
i
found
under
the
lower
trunk
of
an
apple
tree
an
open
place
from
which
a
small
branch
had
evidently
been
wrested
but
on
looking
further
i
discovered
that
every
apple
tree
in
the
orchard
had
been
similarly
disfigured
â€œâ€˜more
mysterious
than
everâ€™
i
said
â€˜but
to-night
shall
decideâ€™
â€œthat
night
i
pleaded
weariness
which
no
one
seemed
inclined
to
question
and
sought
my
couch
earlier
â€œâ€˜goinâ€™
ter
try
it
againâ€™
asked
my
host
â€œâ€˜yes
and
iâ€™ll
stay
all
winter
but
what
iâ€™ll
get
even
with
that
ghostâ€™
i
said
â€œthat
night
i
kept
the
candle
burning
until
midnight
when
i
blew
it
out
â€œinstantly
the
room
was
flooded
with
a
soft
light
and
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
stood
my
ghost
the
identical
ghost
of
last
night
â€œagain
the
bony
finger
beckoned
and
a
sepulchral
voice
whispered
â€˜follow
meâ€™
i
sprang
from
the
bed
but
the
figure
darted
ahead
of
me
it
flew
through
the
doorway
and
down
the
stairs
and
i
after
it
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
an
unseen
hand
reached
forward
and
caught
my
foot
and
i
fell
sprawling
headlong
â€œbut
in
a
second
i
was
on
my
feet
and
pursuing
the
ghost
it
had
gained
on
me
a
few
yards
but
i
was
quicker
and
just
as
we
reached
the
outside
door
i
nearly
touched
its
robes
they
sent
a
chill
through
my
frame
and
i
nearly
gave
up
the
pursuit
â€œas
it
passed
through
the
doorway
it
turned
and
gave
me
one
look
and
i
caught
the
same
malignant
light
in
its
eyes
that
i
remembered
from
the
night
before
â€œin
the
open
orchard
i
felt
sure
i
could
catch
it
â€œbut
my
ghost
had
no
intention
of
allowing
me
any
such
opportunity
to
my
disgust
it
darted
backward
and
into
the
house
slamming
the
door
in
my
face
â€œin
my
frenzy
of
fear
and
chagrin
i
threw
myself
against
the
oaken
door
with
such
force
that
its
rusty
old
hinges
yielded
and
i
landed
in
the
big
front
room
of
the
inn
just
in
time
to
see
the
white
skirts
of
the
ghost
flit
up
the
stairs
â€œupstairs
i
flew
after
it
and
into
an
old
chamber
there
huddled
in
a
corner
i
saw
it
in
the
minuteâ€™s
delay
it
had
secured
a
lighted
candle
and
as
i
entered
it
advanced
to
daunt
me
with
bony
arm
upraised
to
a
great
height
â€œâ€˜caughtâ€™
i
cried
throwing
my
arms
around
the
figure
and
i
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
real
live
ghost
â€œthe
white
robes
fell
and
i
saw
revealed
my
hostess
of
buckstown
inn
â€œnext
morning
when
i
threatened
to
call
the
police
she
confessed
to
me
that
she
masqueraded
as
a
ghost
to
draw
visitors
to
the
out-of-the-way
old
place
and
that
she
found
its
tale
of
being
haunted
highly
profitable
to
herâ€
the
burglarâ€™s
ghost
i
am
not
an
imaginative
man
and
no
one
who
knows
me
can
say
that
i
have
ever
indulged
in
sentimental
ideas
upon
any
subject
i
am
rather
predisposed
in
fact
to
look
at
everything
from
a
purely
practical
standpoint
and
this
quality
has
been
further
developed
in
me
by
the
fact
that
for
twenty
years
i
have
been
an
active
member
of
the
detective
police
force
at
westford
a
large
town
in
one
of
our
most
important
manufacturing
districts
a
policeman
as
most
people
will
readily
believe
has
to
deal
with
so
much
practical
life
that
he
has
small
opportunity
for
developing
other
than
practical
qualities
and
he
is
more
apt
to
believe
in
tangible
things
than
in
ideas
of
a
somewhat
superstitious
nature
however
i
was
once
under
the
firm
conviction
that
i
had
been
largely
helped
up
the
ladder
of
life
by
the
ghost
of
a
once
well-known
burglar
i
have
told
the
story
to
many
and
have
heard
it
commented
upon
in
various
fashions
whether
the
comments
were
satirical
or
practical
it
made
no
difference
to
me
i
had
a
firm
faith
at
that
time
in
the
truth
of
my
tale
eighteen
years
ago
i
was
a
plain
clothes
officer
at
westford
i
was
then
twenty-three
years
of
age
and
very
anxious
about
two
matters
first
and
foremost
i
desired
promotion
second
i
wished
to
be
married
of
course
i
was
more
eager
about
the
second
than
the
first
because
my
sweetheart
alice
moore
was
one
of
the
prettiest
and
cleverest
girls
in
the
town
but
i
put
promotion
first
for
the
simple
reason
that
with
me
promotion
must
come
before
marriage
knowing
this
i
was
always
on
the
lookout
for
a
chance
of
distinguishing
myself
and
i
paid
such
attention
to
my
duties
that
my
superiors
began
to
notice
me
and
foretold
a
successful
career
for
me
in
the
future
one
evening
in
the
last
week
of
september
1873
i
was
sitting
in
my
lodgings
wondering
what
i
could
do
to
earn
the
promotion
which
i
so
earnestly
wished
for
things
were
quiet
just
then
in
westford
and
i
am
afraid
i
half
wished
that
something
dreadful
might
occur
if
i
only
could
have
a
share
in
it
i
was
pursuing
this
train
of
thought
when
i
suddenly
heard
a
voice
say
â€œgood
evening
officerâ€
i
turned
sharply
around
it
was
almost
dusk
and
my
lamp
was
not
lighted
for
all
that
i
could
see
clearly
enough
a
man
who
was
sitting
by
a
chest
of
drawers
that
stood
between
the
door
and
the
window
his
chair
stood
between
the
drawers
and
the
door
and
i
concluded
that
he
had
quietly
entered
my
room
and
seated
himself
before
addressing
me
â€œgood
eveningâ€
i
replied
â€œi
didnâ€™t
hear
you
come
inâ€
he
laughed
when
i
said
that--a
low
chuckling
rather
sly
laugh
â€œnoâ€
he
said
â€œi
dessay
not
officer
iâ€™m
a
very
quiet
sort
of
person
you
might
say
in
fact
noiseless
just
soâ€
i
looked
at
him
narrowly
feeling
considerably
surprised
and
astonished
at
his
presence
he
was
a
thickly
built
man
with
a
square
face
and
heavy
chin
his
nose
was
small
but
aggressive
his
eyes
were
little
and
overshadowed
by
heavy
eyebrows
i
could
see
them
twinkle
when
he
spoke
as
for
his
dress
it
was
in
keeping
with
his
face
he
wore
a
rough
suit
of
woolen
or
frieze
a
thick
gayly
colored
belcher
neckerchief
encircled
his
bull-like
throat
and
in
his
big
hands
he
continually
twirled
and
twisted
a
fur
cap
made
apparently
out
of
the
skin
of
some
favorite
dog
as
he
sat
there
smiling
at
me
and
saying
nothing
it
made
me
feel
uncomfortable
â€œwhat
do
you
want
with
meâ€
i
asked
â€œjust
a
little
matter
oâ€™
businessâ€
he
answered
â€œyou
should
have
gone
to
the
officeâ€
i
said
â€œweâ€™re
not
supposed
to
do
business
at
homeâ€
â€œright
you
are
guvâ€™norâ€
he
replied
â€œbut
i
wanted
to
see
you
itâ€™s
you
thatâ€™s
got
to
do
my
job
if
iâ€™d
haâ€™
seen
the
superintendent
he
might
haâ€™
put
somebody
else
on
to
it
that
wouldnâ€™t
haâ€™
suited
me
you
see
officer
youâ€™re
young
and
natâ€™rally
eager-like
for
promotion
ehâ€
â€œwhat
is
it
you
wantâ€
i
inquired
again
â€œainâ€™t
you
eager
to
be
promotedâ€
he
reiterated
â€œainâ€™t
you
now
officerâ€
i
saw
no
reason
why
i
should
conceal
the
fact
even
from
this
strange
visitor
i
admitted
that
i
was
eager
for
promotion
â€œahâ€
he
said
with
a
satisfied
smile
â€œiâ€™m
glad
oâ€™
that
itâ€™ll
make
you
all
the
keener
now
officer
you
listen
to
me
iâ€™m
a-goinâ€™
to
put
you
on
to
a
nice
little
job
ah
i
dessay
youâ€™ll
be
a
sergeant
before
long
you
will
youâ€™ll
be
complimented
and
praised
for
your
clever
conduck
in
this
â€™ere
affair
mark
my
words
if
you
ainâ€™tâ€
â€œout
with
itâ€
i
said
fancying
i
saw
through
the
manâ€™s
meaning
â€œyouâ€™re
going
to
split
on
some
of
your
pals
i
suppose
and
youâ€™ll
want
a
rewardâ€
he
shook
his
head
â€œa
rewardâ€
he
said
â€œwouldnâ€™t
be
no
use
to
me
at
all--no
not
if
it
was
a
thousand
pounds
no
it
ainâ€™t
nothing
to
do
with
reward
but
now
officer
did
you
ever
hear
of
light
toed
jimâ€
light
toed
jim
i
should
have
been
a
poor
detective
if
i
had
not
why
the
man
known
under
that
sobriquet
was
one
of
the
cleverest
burglars
and
thieves
in
england
and
had
enjoyed
such
a
famous
career
that
his
name
was
a
household
word
at
that
moment
there
was
an
additional
interest
attached
to
him
he
had
been
convicted
of
burglary
at
the
northminster
assizes
in
1871
and
sentenced
to
ten
yearsâ€™
penal
servitude
after
serving
nearly
two
years
of
his
time
he
had
escaped
from
portland
getting
away
in
such
clever
fashion
that
he
had
never
been
heard
of
since
where
he
was
no
one
could
say
but
lately
there
had
been
a
strong
suspicion
among
the
police
that
light
toed
jim
was
at
his
old
tricks
again
â€œlight
toed
jimâ€
i
repeated
â€œi
should
think
so
why
what
do
you
know
about
himâ€
he
smiled
and
nodded
his
head
â€œlight
toed

said
he
â€œis
in
westford
at
this
â€™ere
hidentical
moment

rich
old

as

the
mapleton
road

her--awfully
rich
with
naught
but
women
servants
and
animals
about
the
place

some
very
valyable
plate
there
thatâ€™s
what
light
toed
jimâ€™s
after
heâ€™ll
get
in
through
the
scullery
window
about
1
a
m
then
heâ€™ll
pass
through
the
back
and
front
kitchens
and
into
the
butlerâ€™s
pantry--only
itâ€™s
a
butleress
â€™cos
there
ainâ€™t
no
men
at
all--and
there
heâ€™ll
set
to
work
on
the
safe
some
of
his
late
pals
in
portland
give
him
the
tip
about
this
â€™ere
jobâ€
â€œhow
did

come
to
hear
of

i
asked
â€œnever

i
wants

to
be
up
there
to-night
and
to

â€œthis

jimâ€™s
secrets
and
iâ€™ll
put

i
turned
away
from
him
to
get
my
writing
materials
i
was
not
half
a
minute
with
my
back
to
him
but
when
i
turned
round
he
was
gone
the
door
was
shut
but
i
had
heard
no
sound
from
it
either
opening
or
shutting
quick
as
thought
i
darted
to
it
tore
it
wide
open
and
looked
down
the
narrow
staircase
there
was
no
one
there
i
ran
hastily
downstairs
into
the
passage
and
found
my
landlady
mrs
marriner
standing
at
the
open
door
with
a
female
friend
â€œmrs
marrinerâ€
i
said
breaking
in
upon
their
conversation
â€œwhich
way
did
that
man
go
who
came
downstairs
just
nowâ€
mrs
marriner
looked
at
me
strangely
â€œthere
ainâ€™t
been
no
man
come
downstairs
mr
parkerâ€
said
she
â€œleastways
not
this
good
three-quarters
of
an
hour
which
me
and
missis
higgins
â€™ere
as
â€™ave
come
out
to
take
an
airing
her
having
been

blessed
day

standinâ€™
â€™ere
all
the
time
and
ainâ€™t
never

â€œnonsenseâ€
i
said
â€œa
man
came
down
from
my
room
just
now--the
man
you
sent
up
twenty
minutes
sinceâ€
mrs
marriner
looked
at
me
with
an
expression
betokening
the
most
profound
astonishment
mrs
higgins
sighed
deeply
â€œmr
parkerâ€
said
mrs
marriner
â€œsorry
am
i
to
say
it
sir
but
youâ€™re
either
intoxicated
or
else
youâ€™re
a-sickening
for
brain
fever
sir
there
ainâ€™t
no
person
entered
this
door
in
or
out
for
nigh
onto
an
hour
as
me
and
missis
higgins
â€™ere
will
take
our
bible
oaths
onâ€
i
went
upstairs
and
looked
in
the
rooms
on
either
side
of
mine
the
man
was
not
there
i
looked
under
my
bed
and
of
course
he
was
not
there
he
must
have
gone
downstairs
but
then
the
women
must
have
seen
him
there
was
only
one
door
to
the
house
i
gave
it
up
in
despair
and
began
to
smoke
my
pipe
by
the
time
i
had
drawn
the
last
whiff
i
decided
that
if
anyone
was
â€œintoxicatedâ€
it
was
probably
mrs
marriner
and
mrs
higgins
and
that
my
strange
visitor
had
departed
by
the
door
i
was
not
going
to
believe
that
he
had
anything
supernatural
about
him
i
had
no
duty
that
night
and
as
the
hours
wore
on
i
found
myself
stern
in
my
resolve
to
go
up
to
miss
singletonâ€™s
house
and
see
what
i
could
make
out
of
my
informantâ€™s
story
it
was
my
opinion
that
my
late
visitor
was
a
whilom
â€œpalâ€
of
light
toed
jim
and
that
having
become
aware
of
the
latterâ€™s
plot
he
had
for
some
reason
of
his
own
decided
to
split
on
his
old
chum
thievesâ€™
disagreement
is
an
honest
manâ€™s
opportunity
and
i
determined
to
solve
the
truth
of
the
story
told
me
lest
it
should
come
to
nothing
i
decided
not
to
report
the
matter
to
my
chief
if
i
could
really
capture
light
toed
jim
my
success
would
be
all
the
more
brilliant
by
being
suddenly
sprung
upon
the
authorities
i
made
my
plan
of
action
rapidly
i
took
a
revolver
with
me
and
went
up
to
miss
singletonâ€™s
house
fortunately
i
knew
the
housekeeper
there--a
middle-aged
strong-minded
woman
not
easily
frightened
which
was
a
good
thing
to
her
i
communicated
such
information
as
i
considered
necessary
she
consented
to
conceal
me
in
the
room
where
the
safe
stood
there
was
a
cupboard
close
by
the
safe
from
which
i
could
command
a
full
view
of
the
burglarâ€™s
operations
and
pounce
upon
him
at
the
right
moment
if
only
my
information
was
to
be
relied
upon
there
was
every
chance
of
my
capturing
the
famous
burglar
soon
after
midnight
when
the
house
was
all
quiet
i
went
to
the
pantry
and
got
into
the
cupboard
locking
myself
in
there
were
two
openings
in
the
panel
through
either
of
which
i
was
able
to
command
a
full
view
of
the
room
my
position
was
somewhat
cramped
but
the
time
soon
passed
away
my
mind
was
principally
occupied
in
wondering
if
i
was
really
about
to
have
a
chance
of
distinguishing
myself
somehow
there
was
an
air
of
unreality
about
the
events
of
the
evening
which
puzzled
me
suddenly
i
heard
a
sound
which
put
me
on
the
alert
at
once
it
was
nothing
more
than
the
creaking
of
a
board
or
opening
of
a
door
would
make
in
a
quiet
house
but
it
sounded
intensified
to
my
expectant
ears
i
drew
myself
up
against
the
door
of
the
cupboard
and
placed
my
eye
to
the
opening
in
the
panel
i
had
oiled
the
key
of
the
door
and
kept
my
fingers
upon
it
in
readiness
to
spring
upon
the
burglar
at
the
proper
moment
after
what
seemed
some
time
i
saw
the
gleam
of
light
through
the
keyhole
of
the
door
opening
into
the
pantry
then
it
opened
and
a
man
carrying
a
small
lantern
came
gently
into
the
room
at
first
i
could
see
nothing
of
his
face
but
when
my
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
hazy
light
i
saw
that
i
had
been
rightly
informed
and
that
the
burglar
was
indeed
no
other
than
the
famous
light
toed
jim
as
i
stood
there
watching
him
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
cool
fashion
in
which
he
went
to
work
he
went
over
to
the
window
and
examined
it
he
tried
the
door
of
the
cupboard
in
which
i
stood
concealed
then
he
locked
the
door
of
the
pantry
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
safe
he
set
his
lamp
on
a
chair
before
the
lock
and
took
from
his
pocket
as
neat
and
pretty
a
collection
of
tools
as
ever
i
saw
with
these
he
went
quietly
and
swiftly
to
work
light
toed
jim
was
a
somewhat
slimly
built
fellow
with
little
muscular
development
about
him
while
i
am
a
big
man
with
plenty
of
bone
and
sinew
if
matters
had
come
to
a
fight
between
us
i
could
have
done
what
i
pleased
with
him
but
i
knew
that
jim
would
not
chance
a
fight
somewhere
about
him
i
felt
sure
there
was
a
revolver
which
he
would
use
on
the
least
provocation
my
plan
therefore
was
to
wait
until
his
back
was
bent
over
the
lock
of
the
safe
then
to
open
the
cupboard
door
noiselessly
and
fall
bodily
upon
him
pinning
him
to
the
ground
beneath
me
before
long
the
moment
came
he
was
working
steadily
away
at
the
lock
his
whole
attention
concentrated
on
the
job
the
slight
noise
of
his
drill
was
sufficient
to
drown
the
faint
click
of
the
key
in
the
cupboard
door
i
turned
it
quickly
and
tumbled
right
upon
him
driving
the
tool
out
of
his
hands
and
tumbling
him
into
a
heap
at
the
foot
of
the
safe
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
rage
and
astonishment
as
he
went
down
and
immediately
began
to
wriggle
under
me
like
an
eel
as
i
kept
him
down
with
one
hand
i
tried
to
pull
out
the
handcuffs
with
the
other
this
somewhat
embarrassed
me
and
the
burglar
profited
by
it
to
pull
out
a
sharp
knife
he
had
worked
himself
round
on
his
back
and
before
i
realized
what
he
was
after
he
was
hacking
furiously
at
me
with
his
keen
dagger-like
blade
then
i
realized
that
we
were
going
to
have
a
fight
for
it
and
prepared
myself
he
tried
to
run
the
knife
into
my
side
i
warded
it
off
but
the
blade
caught
the
fleshy
part
of
my
left
arm
and
i
felt
a
warm
stream
of
blood
spurt
out
that
maddened
me
and
i
seized
one
of
the
steel
drills
lying
near
at
hand
and
hit
my
man
such
a
blow
over
the
temple
that
he
collapsed
at
once
and
lay
as
if
dead
i
put
the
handcuffs
on
him
instantly
and
to
make
matters
still
more
certain
i
secured
his
ankles
then
i
rose
and
looked
at
my
arm
the
knife
had
made
a
nasty
gash
and
the
blood
was
flowing
freely
but
it
was
not
serious
and
when
the
housekeeper
who
had
just
then
appeared
on
the
scene
had
bandaged
it
i
went
out
and
secured
the
help
of
the
first
policeman
i
met
in
conveying
light
toed
jim
to
the
office
i
felt
a
proud
man
when
i
made
my
report
to
the
inspector
â€œlight
toed
jimâ€
said
he
â€œwhat
james
bland
nonsense
parkerâ€
but
i
took
him
to
the
cells
where
jim
was
being
attended
to
by
the
doctor
â€œyouâ€™re
right
parkerâ€
he
said
â€œthatâ€™s
the
man
well
this
will
be
a
fine
thing
for
youâ€
after
a
time
feeling
a
little
exhausted
i
went
home
to
try
and
get
some
sleep
the
surgeon
had
attended
to
my
arm
and
told
me
it
was
but
a
superficial
wound
it
felt
sore
enough
in
spite
of
that
i
had
no
sooner
reached
my
lodgings
than
i
saw
sitting
in
my
easy-chair
the
strange
man
who
had
called
upon
me
earlier
in
the
evening
he
rose
to
his
feet
when
i
entered
i
stared
at
him
in
utter
astonishment
â€œwell
guvâ€™norâ€
said
he
â€œi
see
youâ€™ve
done
it
youâ€™ve
got
him
square
and
fair
i
reckonâ€
â€œyesâ€
i
said
â€œahâ€
he
said
with
a
sigh
of
complete
satisfaction
â€œthen
iâ€™m
satisfied
yes
i
donâ€™t
know
as
how
thereâ€™s
aught
more
i
could
say
i
reckon
as
how
light
toed
jim
anâ€™
me
is
quitsâ€
i
was
determined
to
find
out
who
this
man
was
this
time
â€œsit
downâ€
i
said
â€œthereâ€™s
a
question
or
two
i
must
ask
you
just
let
me
get
my
coat
off
and
iâ€™ll
talk
to
youâ€
i
took
my
coat
off
and
went
over
to
the
bed
to
lay
it
down
â€œnow
thenâ€
i
began
and
looked
around
at
him
i
said
no
more
being
literally
struck
dumb
the
man
was
gone
i
began
to
feel
uncomfortable
i
ran
hastily
downstairs
only
to
find
the
outer
door
locked
and
bolted
as
i
had
left
it
a
few
minutes
before
i
went
back
utterly
nonplussed
for
an
hour
i
pondered
the
matter
over
but
could
neither
make
head
nor
tail
of
it
when
i
went
down
to
the
office
next
morning
i
was
informed
that
the
burglar
wanted
to
see
me
i
went
to
his
cell
where
he
was
lying
in
bed
with
his
head
bandaged
i
had
hit
him
pretty
hard
as
it
turned
out
and
it
was
probable
he
would
have
to
lie
on
the
sick
list
for
some
days
â€œwell
guvâ€™norâ€
said
he
â€œyouâ€™d
the
best
of
me
last
night
you
hit
me
rather
hard
that
timeâ€
â€œi
was
sorry
to
have
to
do
it
my
manâ€
i
answered
â€œyou
would
have
stabbed
me
if
you
couldâ€
â€œyesâ€
he
said
â€œi
should
but
i
say
guvâ€™nor
come
a
bit
closer
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
how
did
you
know
i
was
on
that
little
job
last
night
for
sâ€™elp
me
there
wasnâ€™t
a
soul
knew
a
breath
about
it
but
myself
i
hadnâ€™t
no
pals
never
talked
to
anybody
about
it
never
thought
aloud
about
it
as
i
knows
on
how
came
you
to
spot
it
guvâ€™norâ€
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
cell
with
us
and
i
thought
i
might
find
out
something
about
my
mysterious
visitor
of
the
night
before
â€œit
was
a
pal
of
yours
who
gave
me
the
informationâ€
i
said
â€œcanâ€™t
be
guvâ€™nor
no
use
telling
me
that
i
ainâ€™t
got
no
pals--leastways
not
in
this
jobâ€
â€œdid
you
ever
know
a
man
like
thisâ€
i
described
my
visitor
as
i
proceeded
light
toed
jimâ€™s
face
assumed
an
expression
of
real
terror
whatever
color
there
was
in
it
faded
away
i
never
saw
a
man
look
more
thoroughly
frightened
â€œyes
yesâ€
he
said
eagerly
â€œin
course
i
know
who
it
is
why
itâ€™s
barksea
bill
as
i
palâ€™d
with
at
one
time--and
what
did
he
say
guvâ€™nor--that
he
owed
me
a
grudge
that
we
was
quits
at
last
right
you
are
â€™cos
he
did
owe
me
a
grudge
i
treated
bill
very
shabby--very
shabby
indeed
and
he
swore
solemn
heâ€™d
have
his
revenge
onâ€™y
guvâ€™nor
what
you
see
wasnâ€™t
barksea
bill
at
all
but
his
ghost
â€™cos
barksea
billâ€™s
been
dead
and
buried
this
three
yearâ€
i
was
naturally
very
much
exercised
in
my
mind
over
this
weird
development
of
the
affair
and
i
used
to
think
about
it
long
after
light
toed
jim
had
once
more
retired
to
the
seclusion
of
portland
while
he
was
in
charge
at
westford
i
tried
more
than
once
to
worm
some
more
information
out
of
him
about
the
defunct
barksea
bill
but
with
no
success
he
would
say
no
more
than
that
â€œbill
was
dead
and
buried
this
three
yearâ€
and
with
that
i
had
to
be
content
gradually
i
came
to
have
a
firm
belief
that
i
had
indeed
been
visited
by
barksea
billâ€™s
ghost
and
i
often
told
the
story
to
brother
officers
and
sometimes
got
well
laughed
at
that
however
mattered
little
to
me
i
felt
sure
that
any
man
who
had
gone
through
the
same
experience
would
have
had
the
same
beliefs
of
course
i
got
my
promotion
and
was
soon
afterward
married
things
went
well
with
me
and
i
was
lifted
from
one
step
to
another
in
my
secret
mind
i
was
always
sure
i
owed
my
first
rise
to
the
burglarâ€™s
ghost
and
i
should
have
continued
to
think
so
but
for
an
incident
which
occurred
just
five
years
after
my
capture
of
light
toed
jim
i
had
occasion
to
travel
to
sheffield
from
westford
and
had
to
change
trains
at
leeds
the
carriage
i
stepped
into
was
occupied
by
a
solitary
individual
who
turned
his
face
to
me
as
i
sat
down
though
dressed
in
more
respectable
fashion
i
immediately
recognized
the
man
who
had
visited
me
so
mysteriously
at
my
lodgings
my
first
feeling
was
one
of
fear
and
i
daresay
my
face
showed
it
for
the
man
laughed
â€œhallo
guvâ€™norâ€
said
he
â€œi
see
you
knew
me
as
soon
as
you
come
in
you
owes
a
deal
to
me
guvâ€™nor
now
donâ€™t
you
ehâ€
â€œlook
here
my
manâ€
i
said
â€œiâ€™ve
been
taking
you
for
a
ghost
these
five
years
past
now
just
tell
me
how
you
got
in
and
out
of
my
room
that
night
will
youâ€
he
laughed
long
and
loud
at
that
â€œa
ghostâ€
said
he
â€œwell
if
that
ainâ€™t
a
good
un
why
easy
enough
guvâ€™nor
i
was
a-lodging
for
a
day
or
two
in
the
same
house
itâ€™s
easy
enough
when
you
know
how
to
open
a
door
very
quiet
and
to
slip
out
tooâ€
â€œbut
i
followed
you
sharp
and
looked
for
youâ€
â€œay
guvâ€™nor
but
you
looked
down
and
i
had
gone
up
you
should
haâ€™
come
up
to
the
attics
and
there
youâ€™d
haâ€™
found
me
so
you
took
me
for
a
ghost
well
iâ€™m
blowedâ€
i
told
him
what
light
toed
jim
had
said
in
the
cell
â€œayâ€
said
he
â€œi
dessay
guvâ€™nor
you
see
â€™twas
this
way--it
werenâ€™t
jimâ€™s
fault
as
i
wasnâ€™t
dead
he
tried
to
murder
me
guvâ€™nor
he
did
and
left
me
a-lying
for
dead
so
i
ses
to
myself
when
i
comes
round
that
iâ€™d
pay
him
out
sooner
or
later
but
after
that
i
quit
the
profession
jimâ€™s
nasty
conduck
havinâ€™
made
me
sick
of
it
so
i
went
in
for
honest
work
at
my
old
trade
which
was
draining
and
pipe
repairing
i
was
on
a
job
oâ€™
that
sort
in
westford
near
miss
singletonâ€™s
house
when
i
see
light
toed
jim
i
had
a
hidea
what
he
was
up
to
havinâ€™
heard
oâ€™
the
plate
and
i
watches
him
one
or
two
nights
and
gets
a
notion
â€™ow
he
was
going
to
work
the
job
then
oâ€™
course
you
being
a
officer
and
close
at
hand
i
splits
on
him--and
thatâ€™s
allâ€
â€œbut
you
had
got
the
time
and
details
correctâ€
â€œwhy
oâ€™
course
guvâ€™nor
i
was
an
old
hand--served
many
years
at
portland
i
have
and
i
knew
just
how
jim
would
work
it
after
seeing
his
perlimâ€™nary
observations
but
a
ghost
ha
ha
ha
why
guvâ€™nor
you
must
haâ€™
been
a
very
green
young
officer
in
them
daysâ€
perhaps
i
was
at
any
rate
i
learned
a
lesson
from
the
ci-devant
barksea
bill--namely
that
in
searching
a
house
it
is
always
advisable
to
look
up
as
well
as
down
a
phantom
toe
i
am
not
a
superstitious
man
far
from
it
but
despite
all
my
efforts
to
the
contrary
i
could
not
help
thinking
directly
i
had
taken
a
survey
of
my
chamber
that
i
should
never
quit
it
without
going
through
a
strange
adventure
there
was
something
in
its
immense
size
heaviness
and
gloom
that
seemed
to
annihilate
at
one
blow
all
my
resolute
skepticism
as
regards
supernatural
visitations
it
appeared
to
me
totally
impossible
to
go
into
that
room
and
disbelieve
in
ghosts
the
fact
is
i
had
incautiously
partaken
at
supper
of
that
favorite
dutch
dish
sauerkraut
and
i
suppose
it
had
disagreed
with
me
and
put
strange
fancies
into
my
head
be
this
as
it
may
i
only
know
that
after
parting
with
my
friend
for
the
night
i
gradually
worked
myself
up
into
such
a
state
of
fidgetiness
that
at
last
i
wasnâ€™t
sure
whether
i
hadnâ€™t
become
a
ghost
myself
â€œsupposingâ€
ruminated
i
â€œsupposing
the
landlord
himself
should
be
a
practical
robber
and
should
have
taken
the
lock
and
bolt
from
off
this
door
for
the
purpose
of
entering
here
in
the
dead
of
the
night
abstracting
all
my
property
and
perhaps
murdering
me
i
thought
the
dog
had
a
very
cutthroat
air
about
himâ€
now
i
had
never
had
any
such
idea
until
that
moment
for
my
host
was
a
fat
all
dutchmen
are
fat
stupid-looking
fellow
who
i
donâ€™t
believe
had
sense
enough
to
understand
what
a
robbery
or
murder
meant
but
somehow
or
other
whenever
we
have
anything
really
to
annoy
us
and
it
certainly
was
not
pleasant
to
go
to
bed
in
a
strange
place
without
being
able
to
fasten
oneâ€™s
door
we
are
sure
to
aggravate
it
by
myriads
of
chimeras
of
our
own
brain
so
on
the
present
occasion
in
the
midst
of
a
thousand
disagreeable
reveries
some
of
the
most
wild
absurdity
i
jumped
very
gloomily
into
bed
having
first
put
out
my
candle
for
total
darkness
was
far
preferable
to
its
flickering
ghostly
light
which
transformed
rather
than
revealed
objects
and
soon
fell
asleep
perfectly
tired
out
with
my
dayâ€™s
riding
how
long
i
lay
asleep
i
donâ€™t
know
but
i
suddenly
awoke
from
a
disagreeable
dream
of
cutthroats
ghosts
and
long
winding
passages
in
a
haunted
inn
an
indescribable
feeling
such
as
i
never
before
experienced
hung
upon
me
it
seemed
as
if
every
nerve
in
my
body
had
a
hundred
spirits
tickling
it
and
this
was
accompanied
by
so
great
a
heat
that
inwardly
cursing
mine
hostâ€™s
sauerkraut
and
wondering
how
the
dutchmen
could
endure
such
poison
i
was
forced
to
sit
up
in
bed
to
cool
myself
the
whole
of
the
room
was
profoundly
dark
excepting
at
one
place
where
the
moonlight
falling
through
a
crevice
in
the
shutters
threw
a
straight
line
of
about
an
inch
or
so
thick
upon
the
floor--clear
sharp
and
intensely
brilliant
against
the
darkness
i
leave
you
to
conceive
my
horror
when
upon
looking
at
this
said
line
of
light
i
saw
there
a
naked
human
toe--nothing
more
for
the
first
instant
i
thought
the
vision
must
be
some
effect
of
moonlight
then
that
i
was
only
half
awake
and
could
not
see
distinctly
so
i
rubbed
my
eyes
two
or
three
times
and
looked
again
still
there
was
the
accursed
thing--plain
distinct
immovable--marblelike
in
its
fixedness
and
rigidity
but
in
everything
else
horribly
human
i
am
not
an
easily
frightened
man
no
one
who
has
traveled
so
much
and
seen
so
much
and
been
exposed
to
so
many
dangers
as
i
can
be
but
there
was
something
so
mysterious
and
unusual
in
the
appearance
of
this
single
toe
that
for
a
short
time
i
could
not
think
what
to
be
at
so
i
did
nothing
but
stare
at
it
in
a
state
of
utter
bewilderment
at
length
however
as
the
toe
did
not
vanish
under
my
steady
gaze
i
thought
i
might
as
well
change
my
tactics
and
remembering
that
all
midnight
invaders
be
they
thieves
ghosts
or
devils
dislike
nothing
so
much
as
a
good
noise
i
shouted
out
in
a
loud
voice
â€œwhoâ€™s
thereâ€
the
toe
immediately
disappeared
in
the
darkness
almost
simultaneously
with
my
words
i
leaped
out
of
bed
and
rushed
toward
the
place
where
i
had
beheld
the
strange
appearance
the
next
instant
i
ran
against
something
and
felt
an
iron
grip
round
my
body
after
this
i
have
no
distinct
recollection
of
what
occurred
excepting
that
a
fearful
struggle
ensued
between
me
and
my
unseen
opponent
that
every
now
and
then
we
were
violently
hurled
to
the
floor
from
which
we
always
rose
again
in
an
instant
locked
in
a
deadly
embrace
that
we
tugged
and
strained
and
pulled
and
pushed
i
in
the
convulsive
and
frantic
energy
of
a
fight
for
life
he
for
by
this
time
i
had
discovered
that
the
intruder
was
a
human
being
actuated
by
some
passion
of
which
i
was
ignorant
that
we
whirled
round
and
round
cheek
to
cheek
and
arm
to
arm
in
fierce
contest
until
the
room
appeared
to
whiz
round
with
us
and
that
at
least
a
dozen
people
my
fellow
traveler
among
them
roused
i
suppose
by
our
repeated
falls
came
pouring
into
the
room
with
lights
and
showed
me
struggling
with
a
man
having
nothing
on
but
a
shirt
whose
long
tangled
hair
and
wild
unsettled
eyes
told
me
he
was
insane
and
then
for
the
first
time
i
became
aware
that
i
had
received
in
the
conflict
several
gashes
from
a
knife
which
my
opponent
still
held
in
his
hand
to
conclude
my
story
in
a
few
words
for
i
daresay
all
of
you
by
this
time
are
getting
very
tired
it
turned
out
that
my
midnight
visitor
was
a
madman
who
was
being
conveyed
to
a
lunatic
asylum
at
the
hague
and
that
he
and
his
keeper
had
been
obliged
to
stop
at
delft
on
their
way
the
poor
fellow
had
contrived
during
the
night
to
escape
from
his
keeper
who
had
carelessly
forgotten
to
lock
the
door
of
his
chamber
and
with
that
irresistible
desire
to
shed
blood
peculiar
to
many
insane
people
had
possessed
himself
of
a
pocketknife
belonging
to
the
man
who
had
charge
of
him
entered
my
room
which
was
most
likely
the
only
one
in
the
house
unfastened
and
was
probably
meditating
the
fatal
stroke
when
i
saw
his
toe
in
the
moonlight
the
rest
of
his
body
being
hidden
in
the
shade
after
this
terrible
freak
of
his
he
was
watched
with
much
greater
strictness
but
i
ought
to
observe
as
some
excuse
for
the
keeperâ€™s
negligence
that
this
was
the
first
act
of
violence
he
had
ever
attempted
mrs
davenportâ€™s
ghost

dear
readers
do
you
agree
with
hamlet
do
you
believe
that
there
is
more
between
heaven
and
earth
than
we
dream
of
in
our
philosophy
does
it
seem
possible
to
you
that
eliphas
levy
conjured
up
the
shade
of
apollonius
of
tyana
the
prophet
of
the
magii
in
a
london
hotel
and
that
the
great
sage
william
crookes
drank
his
tea
at
breakfast
several
days
a
week
for
months
in
succession
in
the
society
of
the
materialized
spirit
of
a
young
lady
attired
in
white
linen
with
a
feather
turban
on
her
head
do
not
laugh
panic
would
seize
you
in
the
presence
even
of
a
turbaned
spirit
and
the
grotesque
spectacle
would
but
intensify
your
terror
as
for
me
i
did
not
laugh
last
night
on
reading
an
account
in
a
new
york
newspaper
of
a
criminal
trial
that
will
probably
terminate
in
the
death
penalty
of
the
accused
it
is
a
sad
case
i
shudder
as
i
transcribe
the
records
of
the
trial
from
the
testimony
of
the
hotel
waiter
who
heard
the
conversation
of
the
two
confederates
through
a
keyhole
and
of
forty
thoroughly
credible
witnesses
who
testified
to
the
same
facts
what
would
be
my
feelings
if
i
had
seen
the
beautiful
victim
with
the
gaping
wound
in
her
breast
into
which
she
dipped
her
finger
to
mark
the
brow
of
her
murderer
i
about
three
oâ€™clock
on
the
afternoon
of
february
3
professor
davenport
and
miss
ida
soutchotte
a
very
pale
and
delicate
young
girl
who
had
submitted
to
the
tests
of
professor
davenport
for
a
number
of
years
were
finishing
their
dinner
in
their
room
in
the
second
story
of
a
new
york
hotel
professor
benjamin
davenport
was
a
celebrity
but
it
was
said
that
he
owed
his
fame
to
somewhat
questionable
means
the
leading
spiritualists
did
not
repose
the
confidence
in
him
that
manifestly
marked
their
regard
for
william
crookes
or
daniel
douglas
home
â€œgreedy
and
unscrupulous
mediumsâ€
the
author
of
spiritualism
in
america
thinks
â€œare
to
blame
for
the
most
bitter
attacks
to
which
our
cause
has
been
exposed
when
the
materializations
do
not
take
place
as
quickly
as
circumstances
require
they
resort
to
trickery
and
fraud
to
extricate
themselves
from
a
dilemmaâ€
professor
benjamin
davenport
belonged
to
these
â€œversatileâ€
mediums
aside
from
this
queer
stories
were
afloat
about
him
he
was
secretly
accused
of
highway
robbery
in
south
america
cheating
at
cards
in
the
gambling
houses
of
san
francisco
and
the
overhasty
use
of
firearms
toward
persons
who
had
never
offended
him
it
was
said
almost
openly
that
the
professorâ€™s
wife
had
died
from
abuse
and
grief
at
his
infidelity
but
in
spite
of
these
annoying
rumors
mr
davenport
by
virtue
of
his
skill
as
a
fraud
and
fakir
continued
to
exercise
a
great
deal
of
influence
upon
certain
plain
and
simple-minded
folks
whom
it
was
impossible
to
convince
that
they
had
not
touched
the
materialized
spirits
of
their
brothers
mothers
or
sisters
through
the
agency
of
his
wonderful
power
his
professional
success
received
material
accession
from
his
swarthy
mephisto-like
countenance
his
deep
fiery
eyes
his
large
curved
nose
the
cynical
expression
of
his
mouth
and
the
lofty
almost
prophetic
tone
of
his
words
when
the
waiter
had
made
his
last
visit--he
did
not
go
far--the
following
conversation
took
place
in
the
room
â€œthere
is
to
be
a
seance
this
evening
at
the
residence
of
mrs
hardingâ€
began
the
medium
â€œquite
a
number
of
influential
people
will
be
there
and
two
or
three
millionaires
conceal
under
your
skirt
the
blonde
womanâ€™s
wig
and
the
white
material
in
which
the
spirits
usually
make
their
appearanceâ€
â€œvery
wellâ€
replied
ida
soutchotte
in
a
resigned
tone
the
waiter
heard
her
pace
the
room
after
a
pause
she
asked
â€œwhose
spirit
are
you
going
to
control
this
evening
benjaminâ€
the
waiter
heard
a
loud
brutal
laugh
and
the
chair
groaning
beneath
the
weight
of
the
demonstrative
professor
â€œguessâ€
â€œhow
should
i
knowâ€
she
asked
â€œi
am
going
to
conjure
up
the
spirit
of
my
dead
wifeâ€
and
another
burst
of
laughter
issued
from
the
room
full
of
sinister
levity
a
cry
of
terror
burst
from
idaâ€™s
lips
a
muffled
sound
indicated
to
the
eavesdropper
at
the
door
that
she
was
dragging
herself
to
the
feet
of
the
professor
â€œbenjamin
benjamin
donâ€™t
do
itâ€
she
sobbed
â€œwhy
not
they
say
i
broke
mrs
davenportâ€™s
heart
the
story
is
damaging
my
reputation
but
it
will
be
forgotten
if
her
spirit
should
address
me
in
terms
of
endearment
from
the
other
shore
in
the
presence
of
numerous
witnesses
for
you
will
speak
to
me
tenderly
will
you
not
idaâ€
â€œno
no
you
shall
not
do
it
you
shall
not
think
of
it
listen
to
me
for
godâ€™s
sake
during
the
four
years
that
i
have
been
with
you
i
have
obeyed
you
faithfully
and
suffered
patiently
i
have
lied
and
deceived
like
you
i
learned
to
imitate
the
sleep
and
symptoms
of
clairvoyants
tell
me
did
i
ever
refuse
to
serve
you
or
utter
a
word
of
complaint
even
when
my
shoulders
bent
with
the
weight
of
my
burden
when
you
pierced
the
flesh
of
my
arms
with
knitting
needles
worse
than
all
this
i
imitated
distant
voices
behind
curtains
and
made
mothers
and
wives
believe
that
their
sons
and
husbands
had
come
from
a
better
world
to
communicate
with
them
how
often
have
i
performed
the
most
dangerous
feats
in
parlors
with
the
lamps
turned
low
clothed
in
a
shroud
or
white
muslin
i
essayed
to
represent
supernatural
forms
whom
tear-dimmed
eyes
recognized
as
those
of
departed
dear
ones
you
do
not
know
what
i
suffered
at
this
unhallowed
work
you
scoff
at
the
mysteries
of
eternity
i
suffer
the
torments
of
an
impending
retribution
my
god
if
some
time
the
dead
whom
i
counterfeit
should
rise
up
before
me
with
uplifted
arms
and
dreadful
imprecations
this
constant
terror
has
injured
my
heart--it
will
kill
me
i
am
consumed
by
fever
look
how
emaciated
how
worn-out
and
downcast
i
am
but
i
am
under
your
control
do
as
you
like
with
me
i
am
in
your
power

i
want
it
to
be
so

i
ever
complained

do
not

me
to
do
this
thing

on
me
for
what
i
have
done
for
you
in
the
past
for
what
i
am
suffering

not

mummery
do
not
compel
me
to
play
the
role
of
your
dead
wife
who
was
so
tender
and
beautiful
oh
what
put
that
thought
into
your
mind
spare
me
benjamin
i
implore
youâ€
the
professor
did
not
laugh
again
amid
the
confusion
of
upturned
articles
of
furniture
the
eavesdropper
distinguished
the
sound
of
a
skull
striking
the
floor
he
concluded
that
professor
davenport
had
knocked
miss
ida
down
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
or
had
kicked
her
as
she
approached
him
but
the
waiter
did
not
enter
the
room
as
no
one
rang
for
him
ii
that
evening
forty
persons
were
assembled
in
mrs
joanne
hardingâ€™s
parlor
staring
at
the
curtain
where
a
spirit
form
was
in
process
of
materializing
one
dark
lantern
in
a
corner
of
the
room
contributed
the
light
that
emphasized
the
darkness
rather
than
relieved
it
the
room
was
pervaded
by
profound
silence
save
the
quickened
suppressed
breathing
of
the
spectators
the
fire
in
the
grate
cast
mysterious
rays
of
light
resembling
fugitive
spirits
upon
the
objects
around
almost
indistinguishable
in
the
semi-gloom
professor
davenport
was
at
his
best
this
evening
the
spirit
world
obeyed
him
without
hesitation
like
their
lawful
master
he
was
the
mighty
prince
of
souls
hands
that
had
no
arms
were
seen
picking
flowers
from
the
vases
the
touch
of
an
invisible
spirit
conjured
sweet
melodies
from
the
keys
of
the
piano
the
furniture
responded
by
intelligent
rappings
to
the
most
unanticipated
questions
the
professor
himself
elevated
his
form
in
symbolical
distortions
from
the
floor
to
an
altitude
of
three
feet
indicated
by
mrs
harding
and
remained
suspended
in
the
air
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
holding
live
coals
in
his
hands
iii
but
the
most
interesting
as
well
as
the
most
conclusive
test
was
to
be
the
materialization
of
the
spirit
of
mrs
arabella
davenport
which
the
professor
had
promised
at
the
beginning
of
the
seance
â€œthe
hour
has
comeâ€
exclaimed
the
medium
and
while
the
hearts
of
all
throbbed
with
anxious
suspense
and
their
eyes
distended
with
painful
expectancy
of
the
promised
materialization
benjamin
davenport
stood
before
the
curtain
in
the
twilight
the
tall
man
with
the
disheveled
hair
and
demon
look
was
really
terrible
and
handsome
â€œappear
arabellaâ€
he
exclaimed
in
a
commanding
voice
with
gestures
of
the
nazarene
at
the
sepulcher
of
lazarus
all
are
waiting----
suddenly
a
cry
burst
from
behind
the
curtain--a
piercing
shuddering
horrible
shriek
the
shriek
of
an
expiring
soul
the
spectators
trembled
mrs
harding
almost
fainted
the
medium
himself
appeared
surprised
but
benjamin
recovered
his
composure
on
seeing
the
curtain
move
and
admit
the
spirit
the
apparition
was
that
of
a
young
woman
with
long
blonde
tresses
she
was
beautiful
and
pale
clad
in
some
light
whitish
material
her
breast
was
bare
and
on
the
left
side
appeared
a
bleeding
wound
in
which
trembled
a
knife
the
spectators
arose
and
retreated
pushing
their
chairs
to
the
wall
those
who
chanced
to
look
at
the
medium
noticed
that
a
deathly
pallor
had
overspread
his
face
and
that
he
was
cowering
and
trembling
but
the
young
woman
mrs
arabella
the
real
one
whom
he
so
well
remembered
she
had
come
in
response
to
his
summons
and
advanced
in
a
direct
line
toward
benjamin
who
in
terror
covered
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
ghastly
sight
and
with
a
cry
fled
behind
the
furniture
but
she
dipped
the
finger
of
her
thin
hand
into
the
blood
from
her
wound
and
traced
it
across
the
brow
of
the
unconscious
medium
the
while
repeating
in
a
slow
monotonous
tone
that
sounded
like
the
echo
of
a
wail
again
and
again
â€œyou
are
my
murderer
you
are
my
murdererâ€
and
while
he
was
rolling
and
tossing
in
deadly
terror
on
the
floor
they
turned
up
the
lights
the
spirit
had
vanished
but
in
the
communicating
room
behind
the
curtain
they
found
the
body
of
poor
miss
ida
soutchotte
with
horribly
distorted
features
a
physician
who
was
present
pronounced
it
heart
stroke
and
that
is
the
reason
that
prof
benjamin
davenport
appeared
alone
in
a
new
york
courtroom
to
answer
to
the
charge
of
having
murdered
his
wife
four
years
ago
in
san
francisco
the
phantom
woman
he
took
an
all-possessing
burning
fancy
to
her
from
the
first
she
was
neither
young
nor
pretty
so
far
as
he
could
see--but
she
was
wrapped
round
with
mystery
that
was
the
key
of
it
all
she
was
noticeable
in
spite
of
herself
her
face
at
the
window
sunset
after
sunset
her
eyes
gazing
out
mournfully
through
the
dusty
panes
hypnotized
the
lawyer
he
saw
her
through
the
twilight
night
after
night
and
he
grew
at
length
to
wait
through
the
days
in
a
feverish
waiting
for
dusk
and
that
one
look
at
an
unknown
woman
she
was
always
at
the
same
window
on
the
ground
floor
sitting
doing
nothing
she
looked
beyond
so
the
infatuated
solicitor
fancied
at
him
once
he
even
thought
that
he
detected
the
ghost
of
a
friendly
smile
on
her
lips
their
eyes
always
met
with
a
mute
desire
to
make
acquaintance
this
romance
went
on
for
a
couple
of
months
gilbert
dent
assured
himself
that
nothing
in
this
life
can
possibly
remain
stationary
and
he
cudgeled
his
brain
for
a
respectable
manner
of
introducing
himself
to
his
idol
he
had
hardly
arrived
at
this
point
when
he
received
a
shock
there
came
an
evening
when
she
was
not
at
the
window
next
morning
he
walked
down
wood
lane
on
his
way
to
the
office
he
always
went
by
train
but
he
felt
a
strong
disinclination
to
go
through
another
day
without
a
sight
of
her
his
heart
began
to
beat
like
a
schoolgirlâ€™s
as
he
drew
near
the
house
if
she
should
be
at
the
window
he
was
almost
disposed
to
take
his
courage
in
his
hand
and
call
on
her
and--yes
even--tell
her
in
a
quick
burst
that
she
had
mysteriously
become
all
the
world
to
him
he
could
see
nothing
ridiculous
in
this
course
the
possibility
of
her
being
married
or
having
family
ties
of
any
sort
had
simply
never
occurred
to
him
however
she
was
not
at
the
window
what
was
more
there
was
a
sinister
silence
a
sort
of
breathlessness
about
the
whole
place
it
was
a
very
hot
morning
in
late
august
he
looked
a
long
time
but
no
face
came
and
no
movement
stirred
the
house
he
went
his
way
walking
like
a
man
who
has
been
heavily
knocked
on
the
brow
and
sees
stars
still
that
afternoon
he
left
the
office
early
and
in
less
than
an
hour
stood
at
the
gate
again
the
window
was
blank
he
pushed
the
gate
back--it
hung
on
one
hinge--and
walked
up
the
drive
to
the
door
there
were
five
steps--five
steps
leading
up
to
it
at
the
foot
he
wheeled
aside
sharply
to
the
window
he
had
a
sick
dread
of
looking
through
the
small
panes--why
he
could
not
have
told
when
at
last
he
found
courage
to
look
he
saw
that
there
was
a
small
round
table
set
just
under
the
window--a
work-table
to
all
appearance
one
of
those
things
with
lots
of
little
compartments
all
round
and
a
lid
in
the
middle
which
shut
over
a
well-like
cavity
for
holding
pieces
of
needlework
he
remembered
that
his
mother
had
one--thirty
years
before
round
the
edge
of
the
table
was
gripped
a
small
delicate
hand
gilbert
dentâ€™s
eyes
ran
from
this
bloodless
hand
and
slim
wrist
to
a
shoulder
under
a
coarse
stuff
bodice--to
a
rather
wasted
throat
which
was
bare
and
flung
back
so
this
was
the
end--before
the
beginning
he
saw
her
she
was
dead
twisted
on
the
floor
with
a
ghastly
face
turned
up
toward
the
ceiling
and
stiff
fingers
caught
in
desperation
round
the
work
table
he
stumbled
away
along
the
path
and
into
the
lane
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
realize
the
horror
of
this
thing
the
influence
of
the
decayed
house
hung
over
him--nothing
seemed
real
it
was
quite
dark
when
he
moved
away
from
the
gate
and
went
in
the
direction
of
the
nearest
police
station
that
she
was
dead--this
woman
whose
very
name
he
did
not
know
although
she
influenced
him
so
powerfully--he
was
certain
one
look
at
the
face
would
have
told
anyone
that
that
she
was
murdered
he
more
than
suspected
he
had
seen
no
blood
about
there
had
been
no
mark
on
the
long
bare
throat
and
yet
the
word
rushed
in
his
ears
â€œmurderâ€
later
on
he
went
back
with
a
police
officer
they
broke
into
the
house
and
entered
the
room
it
was
in
utter
darkness
of
course
by
now
dent
his
fingers
trembling
struck
a
match
it
flared
round
the
walls
and
lighted
them
for
a
moment
before
he
let
it
fall
on
the
dusty
floor
the
policeman
began
to
light
his
lantern
and
turned
it
stolidly
on
the
window
he
had
no
reason
for
delay
he
was
eager
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
business
his
professional
zeal
was
whetted
this
promised
to
be
a
mystery
with
a
spice
in
it
he
turned
the
light
full
on
the
window
he
gave
a
strange
choked
cry
half
of
rage
half
of
apprehension
then
he
went
up
to
gilbert
dent
who
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
his
hands
before
his
eyes
and
took
his
shoulder
and
shook
it
none
too
gently
â€œthere
ainâ€™t
nobodyâ€
he
said
dent
looked
wildly
at
the
window--the
recess
was
empty
except
for
the
work-table
the
woman
was
gone
they
searched
the
house
they
minutely
inspected
the
garden
everything
was
normal
everything
told
the
same
mournful
tale--of
desertion
of
death
of
long
empty
years
but
they
found
no
woman
nor
trace
of
one
â€œthis
houseâ€
said
the
policeman
looking
suspiciously
into
the
lawyerâ€™s
face
â€œhas
been
empty
for
longer
than
i
can
remember
nobodyâ€™ll
live
in
it
they
do
say
something
about
foul
play
a
good
many
years
ago
i
donâ€™t
know
about
that
all
i
do
know
is
that
the
landlord
canâ€™t
get
it
off
his
handsâ€
it
was
doubtful
if
gilbert
dent
heard
one
word
of
what
the
man
was
saying
he
was
too
stunned
to
do
anything
but
creep
home--when
he
was
allowed
to
go--and
let
himself
stealthily
into
his
own
house
with
a
latch
key
he
was
afraid
even
of
himself
he
did
not
go
to
bed
that
night
as
for
the
mystery
of
the
woman
the
matter
was
allowed
to
drop
it
ended--officially
there
was
a
shrug
and
a
grin
at
the
police
station
the
impression
there
was
that
the
lawyer
had
been
drinking--that
the
dead
woman
in
the
empty
room
was
a
gruesome
freak
of
his
tipsy
brain





a
week
or
so
later
dent
called
on
his
brother
ned--the
one
near
relation
he
had
ned
was
a
doctor
perhaps
he
was
a
shade
more
matter-of-fact
than
gilbert
at
all
events
when
the
latter
told
his
story
of
the
house
and
the
woman
he
attributed
the
affair
solely
to
liver
â€œyou
are
overworkedâ€--the
elder
brother
looked
at
the
youngerâ€™s
yellow
face
â€œan
experience
of
this
nature
is
by
no
means
uncommon
havenâ€™t
you
heard
of
people
having
their
pet
â€˜spooksâ€™â€
â€œbut
this
was
a
real
womanâ€
he
declared
â€œi--i
well
i
was
in
love
with
her
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
marry
her--if
i
couldâ€
ned
gave
him
a
keen
swift
glance
â€œweâ€™ll
go
to
brighton
to-morrowâ€
he
said
with
quiet
decision
â€œas
for
your
work
everything
must
be
put
aside
youâ€™ve
run
completely
down
you
ought
to
have
been
taken
in
hand
beforeâ€
they
went
to
brighton
and
it
really
seemed
as
if
ned
was
right
and
that
the
woman
at
the
window
had
been
merely
a
nervous
creation
it
seemed
so
that
is
for
nearly
three
weeks
and
then
the
climax
came
it
was
in
the
twilight--she
had
always
been
part
of
it--that
gilbert
dent
saw
her
again
the
woman
that
he
had
found
lying
dead
they
were
walking
the
two
brothers
along
the
cliffs
the
wind
was
blowing
in
their
faces
the
sea
was
booming
beneath
the
cliff
ned
had
just
said
it
was
about
time
they
turned
back
to
the
hotel
and
had
some
dinner
when
gilbert
with
a
cry
leapt
forward
to
the
very
edge
of
the
flat
grass
path
on
which
they
were
strolling
the
movement
was
so
sudden
that
his
brother
barely
caught
him
in
time
they
struggled
and
swayed
on
the
very
edge
of
the
cliff
for
a
second
gilbert
possessed
by
some
sudden
frenzy
seemed
resolved
to
go
over
but
the
other
at
last
dragged
him
backward
and
they
rolled
together
on
the
close
thick
turf
at
this
point
gilbert
opened
his
eyes
and
tried
to
get
on
his
feet
â€œbetterâ€
asked
his
brother
cheerfully
holding
out
a
helping
hand
â€œstrange
the
sea
has
that
effect
on
some
people
didnâ€™t
think
that
you
were
one
of
themâ€
â€œwhat
effectâ€
â€œvertigo
my
dear
fellowâ€
â€œnedâ€
said
the
other
solemnly
â€œi
saw
her
it
is
not
worth
your
while
to
try
to
account
for
anything
i
have
been
inclined
to
think
that
you
were
right--that
she
the
woman
at
the
window
was
a
fancy
that
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
creation
of
my
own
brain
but
i
saw
her
again
to-night
you
must
have
seen
her
yourself--she
was
within
a
couple
of
feet
of
you
why
did
you
not
try
and
save
her
it
was
nothing
short
of
murder
to
let
her
go
over
like
that
i
did
my
bestâ€
â€œyou
certainly
did--to
kill
us
bothâ€
said
ned
grimly
gilbert
gave
him
a
wild
look
after
luncheon
ned
persuaded
him
to
rest--watched
him
fall
asleep
and
then
went
out
in
the
porch
of
the
hotel
he
was
met
by
a
waiter
on
his
return
who
told
him
that
gilbert
had
left
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
he
had
himself
gone
out
directly
he
heard
this
he
feared
the
worst
having
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
a
very
hazy
idea
of
what
the
worst
might
be
of
course
he
must
follow
without
a
momentâ€™s
delay
but
a
reference
to
the
time-table
told
him
that
there
was
not
another
train
for
an
hour
and
that
was
slow
it
was
already
getting
dusk
when
he
arrived
there
he
felt
certain
that
gilbert
would
go
there
he
got
to
the
end
of
the
lane
and
walked
up
it
slowly
examining
every
house
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
the
one
he
wanted
gilbert
had
described
it
in
detail
more
than
once
he
stood
outside
the
loosely
hanging
gate
at
last
and
stared
through
the
darkness
at
the
shabby
stucco
front
and
rank
garden
he
went
down
a
flight
of
steps
to
the
back
door
and
finding
it
unfastened
stepped
into
a
stone
passage
it
was
one
of
the
problems
of
the
place
that
he
should
have
avoided
the
main
entrance
door
with
a
half-admitted
dread
and
that
only
half
admitting
still
he
was
afraid
to
mount
the
long
flight
of
stone
stairs
leading
from
the
servantsâ€™
quarters
however
he
pulled
himself
together
and
went
up
to
the
room
it
was
quite
dark
inside
he
heard
something
scuttle
across
the
floor
he
felt
the
grit
and
dust
of
years
under
his
feet
he
struck
a
match--just
as
gilbert
had
done--and
looked
first
at
the
recess
in
which
the
window
was
built
the
match
flared
round
the
room
for
a
moment
and
gave
him
a
flash
picture
of
his
surroundings
he
saw
the
stripes
of
gaudy
paper
moving
almost
imperceptibly
like
tentacles
of
some
sea
monster
from
the
wall
he
saw
a
creature--it
looked
like
a
rat--scurry
across
the
floor
from
the
window
to
the
great
mantelpiece
of
hard
white
marble
if
he
had
seen
nothing
more
than
this
he
saw
in
detail
all
that
the
first
match
had
flashed
at
him
he
saw
his
brother
lying
on
the
floor
a
ghastly
coincidence
his
hand
was
caught
round
the
edge
of
the
work-table
as
hers
had
been
the
other
hand
was
clenched
across
his
breast
there
was
a
look
of
great
agony
on
his
face
a
dead
face
of
course
this
was
the
end
of
the
affair
he
was
lying
dead
by
the
window
where
the
woman
had
sat
every
night
at
dusk
and
smiled
at
him
the
second
match
went
out
the
brother
of
the
dead
man
struck
a
third
he
looked
again
and
closely
then
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
gave
a
cry
it
rang
through
the
empty
rooms
and
echoed
without
wearying
down
the
long
stone
passages
in
the
basement
gilbertâ€™s
head
was
thrown
back
his
chin
peaked
to
the
ceiling
on
his
throat
were
livid
marks
the
doctor
saw
them
distinctly
he
saw
the
grip
of
small
fingers
the
distinct
impression
of
a
womanâ€™s
little
hand





the
curious
thing
about
the
whole
story--the
most
curious
thing
perhaps--is
that
no
other
eye
ever
saw
those
murderous
marks
so
there
was
no
scandal
no
chase
after
the
murderer
no
undiscovered
crime
they
faded
when
the
doctor
saw
his
brother
again
in
the
full
light
and
in
the
presence
of
others
his
throat
was
clear
and
the
post
mortem
proved
that
death
was
due
to
natural
causes
so
the
matter
stands
and
will
but
where
the
house
and
its
overgrown
garden
stood
runs
a
new
road
with
neat
red
and
white
villas
whatever
secret
it
knew--if
any--it
kept
discreetly
ned
dent
is
morbid
enough
to
go
down
the
smart
new
road
in
the
twilight
sometimes
and
wonder
the
phantom
hag
the
other
evening
in
an
old
castle
the
conversation
turned
upon
apparitions
each
one
of
the
party
telling
a
story
as
the
accounts
grew
more
horrible
the
young
ladies
drew
closer
together
â€œhave
you
ever
had
an
adventure
with
a
ghostâ€
said
they
to
me
â€œdo
you
not
know
a
story
to
make
us
shiver
come
tell
us
somethingâ€
â€œi
am
quite
willing
to
do
soâ€
i
replied
â€œi
will
tell
you
of
an
incident
that
happened
to
myselfâ€
toward
the
close
of
the
autumn
of
1858
i
visited
one
of
my
friends
sub-prefect
of
a
little
city
in
the
center
of
france
albert
was
an
old
companion
of
my
youth
and
i
had
been
present
at
his
wedding
his
charming
wife
was
full
of
goodness
and
grace
my
friend
wished
to
show
me
his
happy
home
and
to
introduce
me
to
his
two
pretty
little
daughters
i
was
feted
and
taken
great
care
of
three
days
after
my
arrival
i
knew
the
entire
city
curiosities
old
castles
ruins
etc
every
day
about
four
oâ€™clock
albert
would
order
the
phaeton
and
we
would
take
a
long
ride
returning
home
in
the
evening
one
evening
my
friend
said
to
me
â€œto-morrow
we
will
go
further
than
usual
i
want
to
take
you
to
the
black
rocks
they
are
curious
old
druidical
stones
on
a
wild
and
desolate
plain
they
will
interest
you
my
wife
has
not
seen
them
yet
so
we
will
take
herâ€
the
following
day
we
drove
out
at
the
usual
hour
albertâ€™s
wife
sat
by
his
side
i
occupied
the
back
seat
alone
the
weather
was
gray
and
somber
that
afternoon
and
the
journey
was
not
very
pleasant
when
we
arrived
at
the
black
rocks
the
sun
was
setting
we
got
out
of
the
phaeton
and
albert
took
care
of
the
horses
we
walked
some
little
distance
through
the
fields
before
reaching
the
giant
remains
of
the
old
druid
religion
albertâ€™s
wife
wished
to
climb
to
the
summit
of
the
altar
and
i
assisted
her
i
can
still
see
her
graceful
figure
as
she
stood
draped
in
a
red
shawl
her
veil
floating
around
her
â€œhow
beautiful
it
is
but
does
it
not
make
you
feel
a
little
melancholyâ€
said
she
extending
her
hand
toward
the
dark
horizon
which
was
lighted
a
little
by
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
the
afternoon
wind
blew
violently
and
sighed
through
the
stunted
trees
that
grew
around
the
stone
cromlechs
not
a
dwelling
nor
a
human
being
was
in
sight
we
hastened
to
get
down
and
silently
retraced
our
steps
to
the
carriage
â€œwe
must
hurryâ€
said
albert
â€œthe
sky
is
threatening
and
we
shall
have
scarcely
time
to
reach
home
before
nightâ€
we
carefully
wrapped
the
robes
around
his
wife
she
tied
the
veil
around
her
face
and
the
horses
started
into
a
rapid
trot
it
was
growing
dark
the
scenery
around
us
was
bare
and
desolate
clumps
of
fir
trees
here
and
there
and
furze
bushes
formed
the
only
vegetation
we
began
to
feel
the
cold
for
the
wind
blew
with
fury
the
only
sound
we
heard
was
the
steady
trot
of
the
horses
and
the
sharp
clear
tinkle
of
their
bells
suddenly
i
felt
the
heavy
grasp
of
a
hand
upon
my
shoulder
i
turned
my
head
quickly
a
horrible
apparition
presented
itself
before
my
eyes
in
the
empty
place
at
my
side
sat
a
hideous
woman
i
tried
to
cry
out
the
phantom
placed
her
fingers
upon
her
lips
to
impose
silence
upon
me
i
could
not
utter
a
sound
the
woman
was
clothed
in
white
linen
her
head
was
cowled
her
face
was
overspread
with
a
corpse-like
pallor
and
in
place
of
eyes
were
ghastly
black
cavities
i
sat
motionless
overcome
by
terror
the
ghost
suddenly
stood
up
and
leaned
over
the
young
wife
she
encircled
her
with
her
arms
and
lowered
her
hideous
head
as
if
to
kiss
her
forehead
â€œwhat
a
windâ€
cried
madame
albert
turning
precipitately
toward
me
â€œmy
veil
is
tornâ€
as
she
turned
i
felt
the
same
infernal
pressure
on
my
shoulder
and
the
place
occupied
by
the
phantom
was
empty
i
looked
out
to
the
right
and
left--the
road
was
deserted
not
an
object
in
sight
â€œwhat
a
dreadful
galeâ€
said
madame
albert
â€œdid
you
feel
it
i
cannot
explain
the
terror
that
seized
me
my
veil
was
torn
by
the
wind
as
if
by
an
invisible
hand
i
am
trembling
stillâ€
â€œnever
mindâ€
said
albert
smiling
â€œwrap
yourself
up
my
dear
we
will
soon
be
warming
ourselves
by
a
good
fire
at
home
i
am
starvingâ€
a
cold
perspiration
covered
my
forehead
a
shiver
ran
through
me
my
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
i
could
not
articulate
a
sound
a
sharp
pain
in
my
shoulder
was
the
only
sensible
evidence
that
i
was
not
the
victim
of
an
hallucination
putting
my
hand
upon
my
aching
shoulder
i
felt
a
rent
in
the
cloak
that
was
wrapped
around
me
i
looked
at
it
five
perfectly
distinct
holes--visible
traces
of
the
grip
of
the
horrible
phantom
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
i
should
die
or
that
my
reason
should
leave
me
it
was
i
think
the
most
dreadful
moment
of
my
life
finally
i
became
more
calm
this
nameless
agony
had
lasted
for
some
minutes
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible
for
a
human
being
to
suffer
more
than
i
did
during
that
time
as
soon
as
i
had
recovered
my
senses
i
thought
at
first
i
would
tell
my
friends
all
that
had
passed
but
hesitated
and
finally
did
not
fearing
that
my
story
would
frighten
madame
albert
and
feeling
sure
my
friend
would
not
believe
me
the
lights
of
the
little
city
revived
me
and
gradually
the
oppression
of
terror
that
overwhelmed
me
became
lighter
so
soon
as
we
reached
home
madame
albert
untied
her
veil
it
was
literally
in
shreds
i
hoped
to
find
my
clothes
whole
and
prove
to
myself
that
it
was
all
imagination
but
no
the
cloth
was
torn
in
five
places
just
where
the
fingers
had
seized
my
shoulder
there
was
no
mark
however
upon
my
flesh
only
a
dull
pain
i
returned
to
paris
the
next
day
where
i
endeavored
to
forget
the
strange
adventure
or
at
least
when
i
thought
of
it
i
would
force
myself
to
think
it
an
hallucination
the
day
after
my
return
i
received
a
letter
from
my
friend
albert
it
was
edged
with
black
i
opened
it
with
a
vague
fear
his
wife
had
died
the
day
of
my
return
from
the
tomb
translated
from
the
french
of
de
maupassant
by
e
c
waggener
the
guests
filed
slowly
into
the
hotelâ€™s
great
dining-hall
and
took
their
places
the
waiters
began
to
serve
them
leisurely
to
give
the
tardy
ones
time
to
arrive
and
to
save
themselves
the
bother
of
bringing
back
the
courses
and
the
old
bathers
the
yearly
habitues
with
whom
the
season
was
far
advanced
kept
a
close
watch
on
the
door
each
time
it
opened
hoping
for
the
coming
of
new
faces
new
faces
the
single
distraction
of
all
pleasure
resorts
we
go
to
dinner
chiefly
to
canvass
the
daily
arrivals
to
wonder
who
they
are
what
they
do
and
what
they
think
a
restless
desire
seems
to
have
taken
possession
of
us
a
longing
for
pleasant
adventures
for
friendly
acquaintances
perhaps
for
possible
lovers
in
this
elbow-to-elbow
life
our
unknown
neighbors
become
of
paramount
importance
curiosity
is
piqued
sympathy
on
the
alert
and
the
social
instinct
doubly
active
we
have
hatreds
for
a
week
friendships
for
a
month
and
view
all
men
with
the
special
eyes
of
watering-place
intimacy
sometimes
during
an
hourâ€™s
chat
after
dinner
under
the
trees
of
the
park
where
ripples
a
healing
spring
we
discover
men
of
superior
intellect
and
surprising
merit
and
a
month
later
have
wholly
forgotten
these
new
friends
so
charming
at
first
sight
there
too
more
specially
than
elsewhere
serious
and
lasting
ties
are
formed
we
see
each
other
every
day
we
learn
to
know
each
other
very
soon
and
in
the
affection
that
springs
up
so
rapidly
between
us
there
is
mingled
much
of
the
sweet
abandon
of
old
and
tried
intimates
and
later
on
how
tender
are
the
memories
cherished
of
the
first
hours
of
this
friendship
of
the
first
communion
in
which
the
soul
came
to
light
of
the
first
glances
that
questioned
and
responded
to
the
secret
thoughts
and
interrogatories
the
lips
have
not
dared
yet
to
utter
of
the
first
cordial
confidence
and
delicious
sensation
of
opening
oneâ€™s
heart
to
someone
who
has
seemed
to
lay
bare
to
you
his
own
the
very
dullness
of
the
hours
as
it
were
the
monotony
of
days
all
alike
but
renders
more
complete
the
rapid
budding
and
blooming
of
friendshipâ€™s
flower
that
evening
then
as
on
every
evening
we
awaited
the
appearance
of
unfamiliar
faces
there
came
only
two
but
very
peculiar
ones
those
of
a
man
and
a
woman--father
and
daughter
they
seemed
to
have
stepped
from
the
pages
of
some
weird
legend
and
yet
there
was
an
attraction
about
them
albeit
an
unpleasant
one
that
made
me
set
them
down
at
once
as
the
victims
of
some
fatality
the
father
was
tall
spare
a
little
bent
with
hair
blanched
white
too
white
for
his
still
young
countenance
and
in
his
manner
and
about
his
person
the
sedate
austerity
of
carriage
that
bespeaks
the
puritan
the
daughter
was
possibly
some
twenty-four
or
twenty-five
years
of
age
she
was
very
slight
emaciated
her
exceedingly
pale
countenance
bearing
a
languid
spiritless
expression
one
of
those
people
whom
we
sometimes
encounter
apparently
too
weak
for
the
cares
and
tasks
of
life
too
feeble
to
move
or
do
the
things
that
we
must
do
every
day
nevertheless
the
girl
was
pretty
with
the
ethereal
beauty
of
an
apparition
it
was
she
undoubtedly
who
came
for
the
benefit
of
the
waters
they
chanced
to
be
placed
at
table
immediately
opposite
to
me
and
i
was
not
long
in
noticing
that
the
father
too
had
a
strange
affection
something
wrong
about
the
nerves
it
seemed
whenever
he
was
going
to
reach
for
anything
his
hand
with
a
jerky
twitch
described
a
sort
of
fluttering
zig-zag
before
he
was
able
to
grasp
what
he
was
after
soon
the
motion
disturbed
me
so
much
i
kept
my
head
turned
in
order
not
to
see
it
but
not
before
i
had
also
observed
that
the
young
girl
kept
her
glove
on
her
left
hand
while
she
ate
dinner
ended
i
went
out
as
usual
for
a
turn
in
the
grounds
belonging
to
the
establishment
a
sort
of
park
i
might
say
stretching
clear
to
the
little
station
of
auvergne
chatel-guyon
nestling
in
a
gorge
at
the
foot
of
the
high
mountain
from
which
flowed
the
sparkling
bubbling
springs
hot
from
the
furnace
of
an
ancient
volcano
beyond
us
there
the
domes
small
extinct
craters--of
which
chatel-guyon
is
the
starting
point--raised
their
serrated
heads
above
the
long
chain
while
beyond
the
domes
came
two
distinct
regions
one
of
them
needle-like
peaks
the
other
of
bold
precipitous
mountains
it
was
very
warm
that
evening
and
i
contented
myself
with
pacing
to
and
fro
under
the
rustling
trees
gazing
at
the
mountains
and
listening
to
the
strains
of
the
band
pouring
from
the
casino
situated
on
a
knoll
that
overlooked
the
grounds
presently
i
perceived
the
father
and
daughter
coming
toward
me
with
slow
steps
i
bowed
to
them
in
that
pleasant
continental
fashion
with
which
one
always
salutes
his
hotel
companions
the
gentleman
halted
at
once
â€œpardon
me
sirâ€
said
he
â€œbut
may
i
ask
if
you
can
direct
us
to
a
short
walk
easy
and
pretty
if
possibleâ€
â€œcertainlyâ€
i
answered
and
offered
to
lead
them
myself
to
the
valley
through
which
the
swift
river
flows--a
deep
narrow
cleft
between
two
great
declivities
rocky
and
wooded
they
accepted
and
as
we
walked
we
naturally
discussed
the
virtue
of
the
mineral
waters
they
had
as
i
had
surmised
come
there
on
his
daughterâ€™s
account
â€œshe
has
a
strange
maladyâ€
said
he
â€œthe
seat
of
which
her
physicians
cannot
determine
she
suffers
from
the
most
inexplicable
nervous
symptoms
sometimes
they
declare
her
ill
of
a
heart
disease
sometimes
of
a
liver
complaint
again
of
a
spinal
trouble
at
present
they
attribute
it
to
the
stomach--that
great
motor
and
regulator
of
the
body--this
protean
disease
of
a
thousand
forms
a
thousand
modes
of
attack
it
is
why
we
are
here
i
myself
think
it
is
her
nerves
in
any
case
it
is
sadâ€
this
reminded
me
of
his
own
jerking
hand
â€œit
may
be
hereditaryâ€
said
i
â€œyour
own
nerves
are
a
little
disturbed
are
they
notâ€
â€œmineâ€
he
answered
tranquilly
â€œnot
at
all
i
have
always
possessed
the
calmest
nervesâ€
then
suddenly
as
if
bethinking
himself
â€œfor
thisâ€
touching
his
hand
â€œis
not
nerves
but
the
result
of
a
shock
a
terrible
shock
that
i
suffered
once
fancy
it
sir
this
child
of
mine
has
been
buried
aliveâ€
i
could
find
nothing
to
say
i
was
dumb
with
surprise
â€œyesâ€
he
continued
â€œburied
alive
but
hear
the
story
it
is
not
long
for
some
time
past
juliette
had
seemed
affected
with
a
disordered
action
of
the
heart
we
were
finally
certain
that
the
trouble
was
organic
and
feared
the
worst
one
day
it
came
she
was
brought
in
lifeless--dead
she
had
fallen
dead
while
walking
in
the
garden
physicians
came
in
haste
but
nothing
could
be
done
she
was
gone
for
two
days
and
nights
i
watched
beside
her
myself
and
with
my
own
hands
placed
her
in
her
coffin
which
i
followed
to
the
cemetery
and
saw
placed
in
the
family
vault
this
was
in
the
country
in
the
province
of
lorraine
â€œit
had
been
my
wish
too
that
she
should
be
buried
in
her
jewels
bracelets
necklace
and
rings
all
presents
that
i
had
given
her
and
in
her
first
ball
dress
you
can
imagine
sir
the
state
of
my
heart
in
returning
home
she
was
all
that
i
had
left
my
wife
had
been
dead
for
many
years
i
returned
in
truth
half
mad
shut
myself
alone
in
my
room
and
fell
into
my
chair
dazed
unable
to
move
merely
a
miserable
breathing
wreck
â€œsoon
my
old
valet
prosper
who
had
helped
me
place
juliette
in
her
coffin
and
lay
her
away
for
her
last
sleep
came
in
noiselessly
to
see
if
he
could
not
induce
me
to
eat
i
shook
my
head
answering
nothing
he
persisted
â€œâ€˜monsieur
is
wrong
this
will
make
him
ill
will
monsieur
allow
me
then
to
put
him
to
bedâ€™
â€œâ€˜no
noâ€™
i
answered
â€˜let
me
aloneâ€™
â€œhe
yielded
and
withdrew
â€œhow
many
hours
passed
i
do
not
know
what
a
night
what
a
night
it
was
very
cold
my
fire
of
logs
had
long
since
burned
out
in
the
great
fireplace
and
the
wind
a
wintry
blast
charged
with
an
icy
frost
howled
and
screamed
about
the
house
and
strained
at
my
windows
with
a
curiously
sinister
sound
â€œlong
hours
i
say
rolled
by
i
sat
still
where
i
had
fallen
prostrated
overwhelmed
my
eyes
wide
open
but
my
body
strengthless
dead
my
soul
drowned
in
despair
suddenly
the
great
bell
gave
a
loud
peal
â€œi
gave
such
a
leap
that
my
chair
cracked
under
me
the
slow
solemn
sound
rang
through
the
empty
house
i
looked
at
the
clock
â€œit
was
two
in
the
morning
who
could
be
coming
at
such
an
hour
â€œtwice
again
the
bell
pulled
sharply
the
servants
would
never
answer
perhaps
never
hear
it
i
took
up
a
candle
and
made
my
way
to
the
door
i
was
about
to
demand
â€œâ€˜who
is
thereâ€™
but
ashamed
of
the
weakness
nerved
myself
and
drew
back
the
bolts
my
heart
throbbed
my
pulse
beat
i
threw
back
the
panel
brusquely
and
there
in
the
darkness
saw
a
shape
like
a
phantom
dressed
in
white
â€œi
recoiled
speechless
with
anguish
stammering
â€œâ€˜who--who
are
youâ€™
â€œa
voice
answered
â€œâ€˜it
is
i
fatherâ€™
â€œit
was
my
child
juliette
â€œtruly
i
thought
myself
mad
i
shuddered
shrinking
backward
before
the
specter
as
it
advanced
gesticulating
with
my
hand
to
ward
off
the
apparition
it
is
that
gesture
which
has
never
left
me
â€œagain
the
phantom
spoke
â€œâ€˜father
father
see
i
am
not
dead
someone
came
to
rob
me
of
my
jewels--they
cut
off
my
finger--the--the
flowing
blood
revived
meâ€™
â€œand
i
saw
then
that
she
was
covered
with
blood
i
fell
to
my
knees
panting
sobbing
laughing
all
in
one
as
soon
as
i
regained
my
senses
but
still
so
bewildered
i
scarcely
comprehended
the
happiness
that
had
come
to
me
i
took
her
in
my
arms
carried
her
to
her
room
and
rang
frantically
for
prosper
to
rekindle
the
fire
bring
a
warm
drink
for
her
and
go
for
the
doctor
â€œhe
came
running
entered
gazed
a
moment
at
my
daughter
in
the
chair--gave
a
gasp
of
fright
and
horror
and
fell
back--dead
â€œit
was
he
who
had
opened
the
vault
who
had
wounded
and
robbed

child
and
then
abandoned
her
for
he
could
not
efface
all
trace
of
his
deed
and
he
had
not
even
taken
the
trouble
to
return
the
coffin
to
its
niche
sure
besides
of
not
being
suspected
by
me
who
trusted
him
so
fully
we
are
truly
very
unfortunate
people
monsieurâ€
he
was
silent
meanwhile
the
night
had
come
on
enveloping
in
the
gloom
the
still
and
solitary
little
valley
a
sort
of
mysterious
dread
seemed
to
fall
upon
me
in
presence
of
these
strange
beings--this
corpse
come
to
life
and
this
father
with
his
painful
gestures
â€œlet
us
returnâ€
said
i
â€œthe
night
has
grown
chillâ€
and
still
in
silence
we
retraced
our
steps
back
to
the
hotel
and
i
shortly
afterward
returned
to
the
city
i
lost
all
further
knowledge
of
the
two
peculiar
visitors
to
my
favorite
summer
resort

far

obeyed
she
was
a
typical
western
girl--tall
lithe
graceful
and
limpid-eyed
she
was
clear-skinned
and
high-spirited
too
and
in
this
case
ignorant
through
no
fault
of
her
own
john
barrâ€™s
eyes
scanned
her
intently
and
a
flush
came
to
her
cheeks
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
unpleasantly
conscious
of
her
bare
feet
it
may
have
been
this
that
made
her
stumble
and
spill
some
of
the
contents
of
an
earthen
bowl
over
the
guestâ€™s
knees
as
she
placed
it
on
the
table
her
eyes
flashed
and
a
tear
of
anger
twinkled
on
the
lashes
she
stopped
half
meaning
to
apologize
but
an
oath
from
her
father
caused
her
to
set
the
bowl
down
heavily
and
to
hurry
from
the
cabin
a
moment
later
barr
saw
a
flutter
of
pink
calico
from
behind
a
pile
of
rocks
old
kit

saw
it
too

narvousâ€
barrâ€™s
eyes
asked
the
question
his
lips
refused
to
speak
supper
eaten
the
men
went
outside
and
sat
with
their
chairs
tilted
back
against
the
cabin
something
in
the
younger
manâ€™s
frank
face
had
softened
old
kit
into
a
reminiscent
mood
and
made
him
strangely
inclined
to
gratify
an
idle
curiosity
the
soft
evening
winds
sighed
through
the
branches
of
the
tall
spruce
pines
and
the
declining
rays
of
the
setting
sun
caused
the
shadow
of
the
rude
home
to
stretch
out
longer
across
the
greensward
from
its
shelter
where
he
sat
john
barr
looked
out
on
the
grand
ranges
of
the
rockies
and
wondered
where
in
their
vastness
he
would
find
the
man
he
sought--the
finding
of
whom
had
brought
him
out
into
this
wild
and
almost
forsaken
mining
camp
â€œstranger
iâ€™ve
took
a
likinâ€™
ter

reminds

i
know
anâ€™
you

like
an
honest
chap

do
you
bâ€™lieve
in
ghostsâ€
he
put
the
question
very
suddenly
and
a
look
of
disappointment
crossed
his
face
when
barr
told
him
that
he
did
not
believe
in
spooks
â€œwaal
iâ€™ve
seen
â€™emâ€
a
thought
connecting
the
pink
calico
with
something
in
the
past
came
to
barrâ€™s
mind
â€œcanâ€™t
you
tell
me
about
itâ€
he
asked
â€œiâ€™d
like
ter
if
youâ€™ll
swâ€™ar
on

derringer
never
ter
blab
will
you
swâ€™arâ€
the
solitary
guest
started
to
smile
but
the
smile
faded
at
the
thought
of
unshed
tears
in
pollyâ€™s
eyes
it
might
make
it
easier
for
her
if
he
humored
the
old
man
â€œiâ€™ll
swearâ€
he
said
and
he
did
â€œdo

it
warnâ€™t
no

i
noticed

wuz
plum
dark
anâ€™
as
these

ainâ€™t
a

place
fer
a
man
ter
roam
in
arter
nightfall
especially
if
he
ainâ€™t

swift
gait
fer

â€œjesâ€™

finally
i
gave
a

jerk
anâ€™
made
a
step
terward

anâ€™
as
i

so
he
disappeared
then
i
made
tracks
fer

early

thar

she
answered
stubbornly
â€œitâ€™s
john

at
her
reply
the
younger
manâ€™s
face
grew
deathly
pale
and
he
started
up
from
his
chair
but
kit
thrust
him
back
into
his
seat
saying
â€œbring

â€œwhat

when
yer
well
offâ€
polly
stared
at
the
younger
man
in
utter
bewilderment
for
a
moment
then
turning
slowly
she
stepped
quietly
into
the
cabin
after
the
precious
document
an
unusual
gleam
of
joy
lighted
up
her
face
and
a
suppressed
excitement
shone
in
her
eyes
under
her
breath
she
said
â€œsumhow
er
ruther
i
felt
he
wuz
the
right
oneâ€
too
truly
john
barr
realized
in
that
painful
moment
that
he
whom
he
sought
was
now
dead
to
him
that
the
father
from
whom
he
had
been
parted
so
many
years
was
sleeping
that
long
dreamless
sleep
in
the
clay
mound
on
the
hillside
which
marked
his
last
resting
place
as
he
turned
to
look
at
the
face
of
old
honest
kit
who
had
been
his
fatherâ€™s
friend
during
those
long
years
of
forced
exile
a
happy
smile
lit
up
the
old
minerâ€™s
rugged
features
as
he
pointed
with
his
finger
to
the
rock
cliff
near
the
old
spruce
vine
and
said
in
an
exultant
trembling
voice
â€œthar
he
be
stranger--jesâ€™
as
i
hev
seen
him
many
a
night--yer
dad--my
pard--pore
old
sandyâ€
with
an
eager
voice
john
barr
sprang
forward
and
the
mountains
echoed
and
re-echoed
the
plaintive
cry
of
â€œfather
fatherâ€
but
his
outstretched
arms
clasped
only
emptiness
and
the
darkening
shadows
of
the
rapidly
approaching
night
the
ghosts
of
red
creek
by
s
t
to
the
northward
of
mississippi
city
and
its
neighbor
handsboro
there
extends
a
tract
of
pine
forest
for
miles
with
but
few
habitations
scattered
through
it
black
and
red
creeks
with
their
numerous
branches
drain
this
region
into
the
pascagoula
river
to
the
eastward
with
the
swamps
of
pascagoula
as
a
refuge
and
the
luxuriant
and
unfrequented
bottoms
of
red
and
black
creeks
to
browse
upon
there
are
few
choicer
spots
for
deer
knowing
this
fact
a
small
party
of
gentlemen
on
the
day
before
a
crisp
cold
christmas
started
from
handsboro
in
a
large
four-wheeled
wagon
for
a
thirty-mile
drive
into
this
wilderness
of
pine
and
a
weekâ€™s
sport
after
the
deer
the
guide
was
jim
caruthers
a
true
woodsman
and
the
driver
and
general
factotum
a
jolly
negro
named
jack
lyons
than
whom
no
one
could
make
a
better
hoe-cake
and
cook
a
venison
steak
his
laugh
could
be
heard
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
his
good
nature
was
as
expansive
as
the
range
of
the
laughter
the
usual
experiences
of
a
hunting
camp
were
heartily
enjoyed
during
the
first
days
of
this
life
out
of
doors
but
its
cream
did
not
rise
until
about
the
fifth
night
when
from
familiar
intercourse
jack
lyons
became
loquacious
and
after
the
dayâ€™s
twenty
or
twenty-five-mile
walk
would
spin
yarns
in
front
of
the
camp
fire
which
brought
forgetfulness
of
fatigue
the
night
before
new
yearâ€™s
was
intensely
cold
the
cold
north
wind
of
the
afternoon
had
subsided
at
sunset
and
only
a
gust
now
and
again
touched
the
musical
leaves
of
the
pines
making
them
vibrant
with
that
mournful
score
of
natureâ€™s
operas
which
even
maestros
have
failed
to
catch
in
front
of
two
new
and
white
tents
two
sportsmen
reclined
at
length
within
reach
of
the
warmth
of
the
fire
while
opposite
them
rested
at
ease
the
guide
and
the
worthy
jack
lyons
wearied
with
the
dayâ€™s
chase
four
stanch
hounds--ringwood
rose
jet
and
boxer--were
dreaming
of
future
quarry
the
firelight
brought
out
in
bright
relief
the
trunks
of
the
tall
pines
like
cathedral
columns
and
sparkling
through
the
leafy
dome
overhead
the
scintillating
stars
glistened
with
a
diamond
brightness
a
silence
which
added
its
influence
to
the
scene
rested
about
the
borders
of
the
creek
below
and
gave
more
effect
to
the
story
of
the
veteran
teamster
than
perhaps
it
otherwise
would
have
had
â€œif
de
deer
run
down

said
old
jack
smacking
his
lips
over
a
carefully
prepared
brewing
of
the
real

old
jack
was
naturally
asked
why
he
didnâ€™t
care
about
visiting
the
gibbetâ€™s
place
at
night
asking
to
be
excused
until
he
filled
his
pipe
the
silence
was
unbroken
until
his
return
he
piled
on
more
pine
knots
and
commenced
â€œyou

jack
looked
suspiciously
over
his

into

darkness
and
crawled
into
his
blanket
muttering
â€œit
scares

now

tell
â€™bout

nightâ€
sleep
soon
fell
upon
the
camp
but
the
impression
of
old
jackâ€™s
story
survived
the
night
and
the
next
day
he
still
asserted
its
truth
the
spectre
bride
the
winter
nights
up
at
sault
ste
marie
are
as
white
and
luminous
as
the
milky
way
the
silence
that
rests
upon
the
solitude
appears
to
be
white
also
nature
has
included
sound
in
her
arrestment
save
the
still
white
frost
all
things
are
obliterated
the
stars
are
there
but
they
seem
to
belong
to
heaven
and
not
to
earth
they
are
at
an
immeasurable
height
and
so
black
is
the
night
that
the
opaque
ether
rolls
between
them
and
the
observer
in
great
liquid
billows
in
such
a
place
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
the
world
is
peopled
to
any
great
extent
one
fancies
that
cain
has
just
killed
abel
and
that
there
is
need
for
the
greatest
economy
in
the
matter
of
human
life
the
night
ralph
hagadorn
started
out
for
echo
bay
he
felt
as
if
he
were
the
only
man
in
the
world
so
complete
was
the
solitude
through
which
he
was
passing
he
was
going
over
to
attend
the
wedding
of
his
best
friend
and
was
in
fact
to
act
as
the
groomsman
business
had
delayed
him
and
he
was
compelled
to
make
his
journey
at
night
but
he
hadnâ€™t
gone
far
before
he
began
to
feel
the
exhilaration
of
the
skater
his
skates
were
keen
his
legs
fit
for
a
longer
journey
than
the
one
he
had
undertaken
and
the
tang
of
the
frost
was
to
him
what
a
spur
is
to
a
spirited
horse
he
cut
through
the
air
as
a
sharp
stone
cleaves
the
water
he
could
feel
the
tumult
of
the
air
as
he
cleft
it
as
he
went
on
he
began
to
have
fancies
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
enormously
tall--a
great
viking
of
the
northland
hastening
over
icy
fiords
to
his
love
that
reminded
him
that
he
had
a
love--though
indeed
that
thought
was
always
present
with
him
as
a
background
for
other
thoughts
to
be
sure
he
had
not
told
her
she
was
his
love
because
he
had
only
seen
her
a
few
times
and
the
opportunity
had
not
presented
itself
she
lived
at
echo
bay
too
and
was
to
be
the
maid
of
honor
to
his
friendâ€™s
bride--which
was
another
reason
why
he
skated
on
almost
as
swiftly
as
the
wind
and
why
now
and
then
he
let
out
a
shout
of
exhilaration
the
one
drawback
in
the
matter
was
that
marie
beaujeuâ€™s
father
had
money
and
that
marie
lived
in
a
fine
house
and
wore
otter
skin
about
her
throat
and
little
satin-lined
mink
boots
on
her
feet
when
she
went
sledding
and
that
the
jacket
in
which
she
kept
a
bit
of
her
dead
motherâ€™s
hair
had
a
black
pearl
in
it
as
big
as
a
pea
these
things
made
it
difficult--nay
impossible--for
ralph
hagadorn
to
say
anything
more
than
â€œi
love
youâ€
but
that
much
he
meant
to
have
the
satisfaction
of
saying
no
matter
what
came
of
it
with
this
determination
growing
upon
him
he
swept
along
the
ice
which
gleamed
under
the
starlight
indeed
venus
made
a
glowing
path
toward
the
west
and
seemed
to
reassure
him
he
was
sorry
he
could
not
skim
down
that
avenue
of
light
from
the
love
star
but
he
was
forced
to
turn
his
back
upon
it
and
face
toward
the
northeast
it
came
to
him
with
a
shock
that
he
was
not
alone
his
eyelashes
were
a
good
deal
frosted
and
his
eyeballs
blurred
with
the
cold
and
at
first
he
thought
it
an
illusion
but
he
rubbed
his
eyes
hard
and
at
length
made
sure
that
not
very
far
in
front
of
him
was
a
long
white
skater
in
fluttering
garments
who
sped
over
the
snows
fast
as
ever
werewolf
went
he
called
aloud
but
there
was
no
answer
and
then
he
gave
chase
setting
his
teeth
hard
and
putting
a
tension
on
his
firm
young
muscles
but
however
fast
he
might
go
the
white
skater
went
faster
after
a
time
he
became
convinced
as
he
chanced
to
glance
for
a
second
at
the
north
star
that
the
white
skater
was
leading
him
out
of
his
direct
path
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
wondering
if
he
should
not
keep
to
his
road
but
the
strange
companion
seemed
to
draw
him
on
irresistibly
and
so
he
followed
of
course
it
came
to
him
more
than
once
that
this
might
be
no
earthly
guide
up
in
those
latitudes
men
see
strange
things
when
the
hoar
frost
is
on
the
earth
hagadornâ€™s
father
who
lived
up
there
with
the
lake
superior
indians
and
worked
in
the
copper
mines
had
once
welcomed
a
woman
at
his
hut
on
a
bitter
night
who
was
gone
by
morning
and
who
left
wolf
tracks
in
the
snow--yes
it
was
so
and
john
fontanelle
the
half-breed
could
tell
you
about
it
any
day--if
he
were
alive
alack
the
snow
where
the
wolf
tracks
were
is
melted
now
well
hagadorn
followed
the
white
skater
all
the
night
and
when
the
ice
flushed
red
at
dawn
and
arrows
of
lovely
light
shot
up
into
the
cold
heavens
she
was
gone
and
hagadorn
was
at
his
destination
then
as
he
took
off
his
skates
while
the
sun
climbed
arrogantly
up
to
his
place
above
all
other
things
hagadorn
chanced
to
glance
lakeward
and
he
saw
there
was
a
great
wind-rift
in
the
ice
and
that
the
waves
showed
blue
as
sapphires
beside
the
gleaming
ice
had
he
swept
along
his
intended
path
watching
the
stars
to
guide
him
his
glance
turned
upward
all
his
body
at
magnificent
momentum
he
must
certainly
have
gone
into
that
cold
grave
the
white
skater
had
been
his
guardian
angel
much
impressed
he
went
up
to
his
friendâ€™s
house
expecting
to
find
there
the
pleasant
wedding
furore
but
someone
met
him
quietly
at
the
door
and
his
friend
came
downstairs
to
greet
him
with
a
solemn
demeanor
â€œis
this
your
wedding
faceâ€
cried
hagadorn
â€œwhy
really
if
this
is
the
way
you
are
affected
the
sooner
i
take
warning
the
betterâ€
â€œthereâ€™s
no
wedding
to-dayâ€
said
his
friend
â€œno
wedding
why
youâ€™re
not----â€
â€œmarie
beaujeu
died
last
night----â€
â€œmarie----â€
â€œdied
last
night
she
had
been
skating
in
the
afternoon
and
she
came
home
chilled
and
wandering
in
her
mind
as
if
the
frost
had
got
in
it
somehow
she
got
worse
and
worse
and
talked
all
the
time
of
youâ€
â€œof
meâ€
â€œwe
wondered
what
it
all
meant
we
didnâ€™t
know
you
were
loversâ€
â€œi
didnâ€™t
know
it
myself
moreâ€™s
the
pityâ€
â€œshe
said
you
were
on
the
ice
she
said
you
didnâ€™t
know
about
the
big
breaking
up
and
she
cried
to
us
that
the
wind
was
off
shore
then
she
cried
that
you
could
come
in
by
the
old
french
creek
if
you
only
knew----â€
â€œi
came
in
that
wayâ€
interrupted
hagadorn
â€œhow
did
you
come
to
do
that
itâ€™s
out
of
your
wayâ€
so
hagadorn
told
him
how
it
came
to
pass
and
that
day
they
watched
beside
the
maiden
who
had
tapers
at
her
head
and
feet
and
over
in
the
little
church
the
bride
who
might
have
been
at
her
wedding
said
prayers
for
her
friend
then
they
buried
her
in
her
bridesmaidâ€™s
white
and
hagadorn
was
there
before
the
altar
with
her
as
he
intended
from
the
first
at
midnight
the
day
of
the
burial
her
friends
were
married
in
the
gloom
of
the
cold
church
and
they
walked
together
through
the
snow
to
lay
their
bridal
wreaths
on
her
grave
three
nights
later
hagadorn
started
back
again
to
his
home
they
wanted
him
to
go
by
sunlight
but
he
had
his
way
and
went
when
venus
made
her
bright
path
on
the
ice
he
hoped
for
the
companionship
of
the
white
skater
but
he
did
not
have
it
his
only
companion
was
the
wind
the
only
voice
he
heard
was
the
baying
of
a
wolf
on
the
north
shore
the
world
was
as
white
as
if
it
had
just
been
created
and
the
sun
had
not
yet
colored
nor
man
defiled
it
how
he
caught
the
ghost
â€œyes
the
house
is
a
good
oneâ€
said
the
agent
â€œitâ€™s
in
a
good
neighborhood
and
youâ€™re
getting
it
at
almost
nothing
but
i
think
it
right
to
tell
you
all
about
it
you
are
orphans
you
say
and
with
a
mother
dependent
on
you
that
makes
it
all
the
more
necessary
that
you
should
know
the
fact
is
the
house
is
said
to
be
haunted----â€
the
agent
could
not
help
smiling
as
he
said
it
and
he
was
relieved
to
see
an
answering
smile
on
the
two
faces
before
him
â€œah
you
donâ€™t
believe
in
ghostsâ€
he
went
on
â€œnor
do
i
for
that
matter
but
somehow
the
reputation
of
the
house
keeps
me
from
having
a
tenant
long
at
a
time
the
place
ought
to
rent
for
twice
as
much
as
it
doesâ€
â€œif
we
succeed
in
driving
out
the
ghost
you
will
not
raise
the
rentâ€
asked
the
boy
with
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
eyes
â€œwell
no--not
this
year
at
any
rateâ€
laughed
the
agent
and
so
the
house
was
rented
and
the
slip
of
a
girl
and
the
tall
lad
her
brother
went
their
way
within
a
week
the
family
had
moved
into
the
house
and
were
delighted
with
it
it
was
large
and
cool
with
wide
halls
and
fine
stairways
and
with
more
room
than
they
needed
but
that
did
not
matter
in
the
least
for
they
had
always
been
cramped
in
small
houses
suffering
many
discomforts
and
they
never
could
have
afforded
such
a
place
as
this
if
it
had
not
been
â€œhauntedâ€
â€œblessings
on
the
ghostâ€
cried
margaret
gaily
as
she
ran
about
as
merry
as
a
child
â€œwho
would
be
without
a
ghost
in
the
house
when
it
brings
one
like
thisâ€
â€œand
it
is
so
near
your
schoolâ€
said
the
mother
â€œand
i
used
to
worry
so
over
the
long
walk
and
david
can
come
home
to
lunch
now
and
you
donâ€™t
know
what
a
pleasure
that
will
beâ€
â€œit
seems
to
meâ€
david
gravely
explained
â€œthat
if
i
should
meet
the
ghost
i
would
treat
him
with
the
greatest
politeness
and
encourage
him
to
stay
we
shall
not
miss
the
room
he
takes
shall
we
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
set
aside
that
room
over
yours
maggie
for
his
ghostshipâ€™s
own
for
we
shall
not
need
that
you
know
besides
the
door
doesnâ€™t
shut
and
he
can
go
in
and
out
without
breaking
the
lockâ€
and
then
they
all
laughed
and
had
a
great
deal
of
fun
over
the
ghost
which
was
a
great
joke
to
them
they
were
very
tired
that
night
and
slept
soundly
all
night
long
when
they
met
the
next
morning
there
was
more
laughter
about
the
ghost
which
was
shy
about
meeting
strangers
probably
and
had
made
no
effort
to
introduce
himself
for
the
next
three
days
they
were
all
hard
at
work
trying
to
bring
chaos
into
something
like
order
and
then
it
was
time
for
the
school
to
open
and
margaret
was
to
begin
teaching
and
david
inserted
an
advertisement
in
the
city
papers
for
a
maid-of-all-work
who
might
help
their
mother
in
their
absence
for
one
whole
day
prospective
colored
servants
presented
themselves
and
announced
â€œis
dis
de
house
whar
dey
wants
a
worklady
no
maâ€™am
i
ainâ€™
gwine
to
work
in
dis
house
ketch
me
workinâ€™
in
no
haâ€™nted
houseâ€
after
which
they
each
and
all
departed
and
others
came
in
their
stead
one
was
secured
after
a
while
but
no
sooner
had
she
talked
across
the
fence
with
a
neighborâ€™s
servant
than
she
too
departed
â€œnever
mind
childrenâ€
said
mrs
craig
wearily
â€œi
would
much
rather
do
the
work
than
be
troubled
in
this
wayâ€
so
the
maid-of-all-work
was
dismissed
and
the
craig
family
locked
the
doors
and
went
to
their
rooms
worn
out
with
the
dayâ€™s
anxieties
they
had
been
in
the
house
four
days
and
there
had
been
neither
sight
nor
sound
of
the
ghost
the
very
mention
of
it
was
enough
to
start
them
all
to
laughing
for
they
were
thoroughly
practical
people
with
a
fondness
for
inquiring
into
anything
that
seemed
mysterious
to
them
and
for
understanding
it
thoroughly
before
they
let
it
go
david
was
soon
sleeping
the
sound
sleep
of
healthy
boyhood
and
all
was
silent
in
the
house
when
margaret
stole
softly
into
his
room
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
he
was
not
easy
to
waken
and
several
minutes
had
passed
before
he
sat
up
in
bed
with
an
articulate
murmur
of
surprise
â€œhushâ€
said
margaret
in
a
whisper
with
her
hand
on
his
lips
â€œi
want
you
to
come
into
my
room
and
listen
to
a
sound
that
i
have
been
hearing
for
some
timeâ€
â€œdoors
creakingâ€
suggested
david
as
he
began
to
dress
â€œnothing
of
the
kindâ€
was
all
she
said
they
walked
up
the
stairway
and
along
the
upper
hall
to
the
door
of
the
unused
room
something
was
wrong
with
the
lock
and
the
door
would
not
stay
fastened
as
i
have
said
something
that
was
not
fear
thrilled
their
hearts
as
they
pushed
the
door
further
ajar
and
stood
where
they
could
see
every
foot
of
the
vacant
floor
one
of
their
own
boxes
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
but
aside
from
that
nothing
was
to
be
seen
and
they
looked
at
one
another
in
silence
â€œhold
the
lamp
a
minute
maggieâ€
david
said
at
last
and
then
he
went
all
over
the
room
and
looked
more
particularly
at
its
emptiness
and
even
felt
the
walls
â€œsecret
panels
you
knowâ€
he
said
with
a
smile
but
it
was
a
very
puzzled
smile
indeed
â€œi
canâ€™t
see
what
it
could
have
beenâ€
margaret
said
as
they
went
down
the
stairs
â€œno
i
canâ€™t
see
either
but
iâ€™m
going
to
seeâ€
said
david
â€œthat
was
a
chain
and
chains
donâ€™t
drag
around
by
themselves
you
know
a
ghost
could
not
drag
a
chain
if
he
were
to
tryâ€
â€œthe
conventional
ghost
very
often
drags
chainsâ€
said
margaret
as
she
closed
the
door
of
her
room
and
then
she
lay
awake
all
night
and
listened
for
the
conventional
ghost
that
dragged
a
chain
but
it
seemed
that
the
weight
of
the
chain
must
have
wearied
him
for
he
was
not
heard
again
the
mother
had
slept
through
it
all
and
next
morning
they
gave
her
a
vivid
account
of
the
nightâ€™s
adventure
â€œperhaps
it
was
someone
in
the
houseâ€
she
said
in
alarm
there
were
no
ghosts
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
but
burglars
were
very
possible
indeed
then
margaret
and
david
both
laughed
more
than
ever
â€œwhat
fun
it
would
beâ€
said
david
â€œfor
a
burglar
to
get
into
this
house
and
try
to
find
something
worth
carrying
awayâ€
so
they
went
on
to
the
next
night
all
three
fully
determined
to
spend
the
night
in
listening
for
the
ghost
and
running
him
to
earth
if
possible
but
it
was
margaret
that
heard
the
ghost
after
all
she
had
been
sleeping
and
was
suddenly
startled
wide
awake
and
there
overhead
was
the
sound
of
the
chain
dragging
and
just
as
she
was
on
the
point
of
springing
out
of
bed
to
call
her
brother
the
chain
seemed
to
go
out
of
the
upper
room
she
lay
still
and
listened
and
in
a
moment
she
heard
it
again
it
was
coming
down
the
stairs
there
was
no
carpet
on
the
stairs
and
she
could
hear
the
chain
drop
from
step
to
step
until
it
had
come
the
whole
way
down
there
it
was
almost
at
the
door
of
her
room
and
something
that
was
strangely
like
fear
kept
her
lying
still
listening
in
horrified
silence
then
it
went
along
the
hall
dragging
close
to
the
door
and
then
further
away
and
back
and
forth
for
awhile
and
then
it
began
dragging
back
up
the
stairs
again
step
by
step
she
could
hear
it
drawn
over
the
edge
of
every
step--and
by
the
time
it
had
reached
the
top
she
remembered
herself
and
called
david
again
did
the
brother
and
sister
make
a
tour
of
the
upper
room
with
the
lamp
not
only
that
but
they
looked
into
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
upper
part
of
the
house
and
at
last
came
back
baffled
they
had
seen
nothing
extraordinary
and
they
had
not
heard
a
sound
â€œiâ€™m
going
to
see
that
ghost
to-nightâ€
david
said
to
his
sister
the
next
evening
â€œhowâ€
â€œiâ€™m
going
to
sit
up
all
night
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
donâ€™t
say
anything
about
it
to
mother
it
might
make
her
uneasyâ€
so
after
the
household
were
all
quiet
david
slipped
into
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
sat
down
to
his
vigil
he
had
placed
a
screen
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
so
that
it
hid
him
from
view--as
if
a
ghost
cared
for
a
screen--and
he
established
himself
behind
it
and
prepared
to
be
as
patient
as
he
could
it
seemed
to
him
that
hours
so
long
had
never
been
devised
as
those
the
town
clocks
tolled
off
that
night
he
bore
it
until
midnight
moderately
well
because
he
argued
with
himself
if
there
were
any
ghosts
about
they
would
surely
walk
then
but
they
were
not
in
a
humor
for
walking
and
still
the
hours
rolled
on
without
any
developments
he
took
the
fidgets
and
had
nervous
twitches
all
over
him
and
at
last
he
could
endure
it
no
longer
and
had
leaned
his
head
back
against
the
wall
and
was
going
blissfully
to
sleep
when----
he
heard
a
chain
dragging
just
beyond
the
open
door
of
that
unused
room
in
spite
of
himself
a
shiver
ran
down
his
back
there
was
no
mistaking
it
it
was
a
real
chain
if
he
had
ever
heard
one
more
than
that
it
had
left
the
room
and
was
coming
straight
towards
the
stairs
the
hall
was
dark
and
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
see
anything
although
he
strained
his
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
even
while
he
looked
it
had
passed
behind
the
screen
and
was
going
down
the
stairs
dropping
from
step
to
step
with
a
clank
half
way
down
a
narrow
strip
of
moonlight
from
a
stair-window
lay
directly
across
the
steps
whatever
the
thing
was
it
must
pass
through
that
patch
of
light
and
david
leaned
forward
and
watched
down
it
went
from
step
to
step
and
presently
it
had
slipped
through
the
light
and
was
down
and
a
little
later
it
came
back
again
through
the
light
and
up
the
stairs
and
back
into
that
unused
room
and
then
david
slapped
his
knees
jubilantly
and
ran
down
to
his
room
and
slept
all
the
rest
of
the
night
next
morning
he
was
very
mysterious
about
his
discoveries
of
the
night
before
â€œoh
yes
i
saw
the
ghostâ€
he
said
to
maggie
â€œthere
donâ€™t
ask
so
many
questions
iâ€™ll
tell
you
more
about
it
to-morrow
maybeâ€
and
that
was
all
the
information
she
could
get
from
him
it
was
very
provoking
that
day
david
made
a
purchase
down
town
and
brought
home
a
bulky
bundle
which
he
hid
in
his
own
room
and
would
not
let
his
sister
even
peep
at
â€œiâ€™m
going
to
try
to
catch
a
ghost
to-nightâ€
he
said
â€œand
you
know
how
it
is
if
i
brag
too
much
beforehand
i
shall
be
sure
to
failâ€
he
was
working
with
something
in
the
hall
after
the
others
had
retired
but
he
did
not
sit
up
this
time
he
went
to
bed
and
margaret
listened
at
his
door
and
found
that
he
was
soon
asleep
but
away
in
the
night
they
were
all
awakened
by
a
squealing
that
brought
them
all
into
the
hall
in
a
great
hurry
and
there
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
they
found
the
huge
rat-trap
that
david
had
set
a
few
hours
before
and
in
the
midst
of
the
toils
was
a
rat
â€œwhy
davidâ€
exclaimed
the
mother
â€œi
didnâ€™t
know
that
there
was
a
rat
in
the
houseâ€
and
then
all
at
once
she
saw
that
there
was
a
long
chain
hanging
from
a
little
iron
collar
around
the
creatureâ€™s
neck
and
she
and
margaret
cried
together
â€œand
this
was
the
ghostâ€
such
a
funny
ghost
when
they
came
to
think
of
it--this
poor
rat
with
a
nest
in
some
hole
of
the
broken
chimney
he
had
been
someoneâ€™s
pet
once
perhaps
and
now
the
households
he
had
broken
up
the
nights
he
had
disturbed
the
wild
sensations
he
had
created--it
made
his
captors
laugh
to
think
that
this
innocent
creature
had
been
the
cause
of
the
whole
trouble
â€œiâ€™ll
get
a
cage
for
him
and
take
care
of
him
for
the
rest
of
his
lifeâ€
said
david
â€œwe
owe
him
so
much
that
we
canâ€™t
afford
to
be
ungratefulâ€
the
next
morning
he
took
the
ghost-in-a-cage
and
showed
it
to
the
agent
and
gave
him
a
vivid
account
of
the
capture
â€œso
you
have
a
good
house
for
about
half
price
all
on
account
of
that
ratâ€
exclaimed
the
agent
grimly
â€œyoung
man--but
never
mind
you
deserve
it
what
are
you
working
for
now
six
dollars
a
week
if
you
ever
want
to
change
your
place--suppose
you
come
around
here
i
think
you
need
a
business
that
will
give
you
a
chance
to
growâ€
and
the
agent
and
david
shook
hands
warmly
over
the
cage
of
the
â€œghostâ€
grand-dameâ€™s
ghost
story
by
c
d
i
donâ€™t
know
whether
you
ever
tell
your
children
ghost
stories
or
not
some
mothers
donâ€™t
but
our
mother
though
of
german
descent
was
strong-minded
on
the
ghost
subject
and
early
taught
all
of
her
children
to
be
fearless
mentally
as
well
as
physically
and
though
dearly
fond
of
hearing
ghost
stories
especially
if
they
were
real
true
ghosts
we
were
sadly
skeptical
as
to
their
being
anything
of
the
kind
that
could
harm
we
were
quite
learned
in
ghostly
lore
knew
all
about
â€œdoppeigangersâ€
â€œwill
oâ€™
the
wispâ€
â€œblue
lightsâ€
etc
and
we
could
not
have
a
greater
treat
for
good
behavior
than
for
our
mother
to
draw
on
her
store
of
supernatural
tales
for
our
entertainment
the
story
i
am
about
to
relate
she
told
us
one
stormy
night
when
gathered
round
her
chair
in
her
own
cozy
sanctum
before
a
cheerful
fire
we
ate
nuts
and
apples
and
listened
while
she
recited
â€œan
oâ€™er
true
taleâ€
told
her
by
her
grandmother
who
herself
witnessed
the
vision
it
was
a
fearful
night
the
wind
sobbed
and
wailed
round
the
house
like
lost
spirits
mourning
their
doom
the
rain
beat
upon
the
casements
and
the
trees
writhing
in
the
torture
of
the
fierce
blast
groaned
and
swayed
until
their
tops
almost
swept
the
earth
bright
flashes
of
lightning
pierced
even
through
the
closed
shutters
and
heavy
curtains
and
the
thunder
had
a
sullen
threatening
roar
that
made
your
blood
creep
it
was
a
night
to
make
one
seek
to
shut
out
all
sound
draw
the
curtains
close
stir
the
fire
and
nestle
deep
in
the
arm-chair
before
it
with
feet
upon
the
fender
and
have
something
cheerful
to
think
or
talk
about
but
i
was
all
alone
none
in
the
house
with
me
but
the
servants
and
the
servantsâ€™
wing
was
detached
from
the
main
part
of
the
building
for
i
do
not
care
to
have
menials
near
me
and
i
had
no
loved
ones
near
it
was
just
such
a
night
that
nancy
black
died
â€œwhat
a
fearful
night
for
the
soul
to
leave
its
earthly
home
and
go
out
into
the
vast
unknown
futureâ€
i
spoke
aloud
as
rousing
from
a
train
of
thought
i
drew
my
heavy
mantle
closer
round
me
wheeled
my
arm-chair
nearer
the
fire
and
cuddled
down
in
it
burying
my
feet
in
the
foot-cushion
to
warm
them
for
i
felt
strangely
cold
i
was
in
the
library
it
was
my
usual
sitting-room
for
i
seldom
used
the
parlors
what
was
the
use
my
books
were
my
friends
and
i
loved
best
to
be
with
them
my
children
dead
or
married
and
away
the
cold
grand
parlors
always
seemed
gloomy
and
sad
the
ghosts
of
departed
pleasures
haunted
them
and
i
cared
not
to
enter
them
it
was
a
long
wide
room
across
the
hall
from
the
parlors
running
the
whole
length
of
the
house
and
was
lined
with
shelves
from
floor
to
ceiling
my
husbandâ€™s
father
had
been
a
bibliomaniac
and
my
husband
had
had
a
leaning
that
way
also
and
the
shelves
held
many
an
old
rare
work
that
was
worth
its
weight
in
gold
the
fire
though
burning
brightly
did
not
illume
one-half
the
room
of
which
sitting
in
the
chimney
corner
i
commanded
a
full
view
and
had
been
looking
at
the
shadows
playing
on
the
furniture
and
shelves
as
the
flame
shot
up
and
after
flickering
a
moment
would
die
out
leaving
a
gloom
which
would
break
away
into
fantastic
shadows
as
the
firelight
would
again
shoot
up
while
watching
the
gleams
of
light
and
darkling
shades
unconsciously
the
wailing
of
the
storm
outside
attracted
my
attention
there
seemed
to
be
odd
noises
of
tapping
on
the
windows
and
sobs
and
sighs
as
though
someone
was
entreating
entrance
from
the
fierce
tumult
and
as
i
sat
there
again
i
thought
of
nancy
black
the
old
schoolgirl
friend
who
had
loved
me
so
dearly
and
the
night
when
she
went
forth
to
meet
the
doom
appointed
her
resting
my
head
upon
my
hand
i
sat
gazing
in
the
fire
thinking
over
her
strange
life
and
still
stranger
death
and
wondering
what
could
have
become
of
the
money
and
jewels
that
i
knew
she
had
once
possessed
while
sitting
thus
a
queer
sensation
crept
over
me
it
was
not
fear
but
a
feeling
as
though
if
iâ€™d
look
up
iâ€™d
see
something
frightful
a
shiver
not
like
that
of
cold
ran
from
my
head
to
my
feet
and
a
sensation
as
though
someone
was
breathing
icy
cold
breath
upon
my
forehead
the
same
feeling
you
would
cause
by
holding
a
piece
of
ice
to
your
cheek
it
fluttered
over
my
face
and
finally
settled
round
my
lips
as
though
the
unseen
one
was
caressing
me
thrilling
me
with
horror
but
i
am
not
fearful
nervous
nor
imaginative
and
resolutely
throwing
off
the
dread
that
fell
upon
me
i
turned
round
and
looked
up
and
there
so
close
by
my
side
that
my
hand
involuntarily
thrown
out
passed
through
her
seeming
form
stood
nancy
black
it
was
nancy
black
and
yet
not
nancy
black
her
whole
body
had
a
semi-transparent
appearance
just
as
your
hand
looks
when
you
hold
it
between
yourself
and
a
strong
light
her
clothing
apparently
the
same
as
worn
in
life
had
a
wavy
seething
flickering
look
like
flames
have
and
yet
did
not
seem
to
burn
â€œin
the
name
of
god
nancy
black
what
brought
you
here
and
whence
came
youâ€
i
exclaimed
a
hollow
whisper
followed
â€œthank
you
my
old
friend
for
speaking
to
me
and
oh
how
deeply
i
thank
you
for
thinking
of
me
to-night--i
shall
have
restâ€
rest
i
heard
echoed
and
a
jeering
laugh
rang
through
the
room
that
made
her
quiver
at
its
sound
â€œi
have
been
near
you
often
but
always
failed
to
find
you
in
a
condition
when
you
would
be
en
rapport
before
to-night
what
i
came
for
i
will
tell
you
whence
i
come
you
need
not
know
suffice
it
to
say
that
were
i
happy
i
would
not
be
here
on
such
an
errand
nor
on
such
a
night--it
is
only
when
the
elements
are
in
a
tumult
and
the
winds
wail
and
moan
that
we
come
forth
when
you
hear
these
sounds
it
is
souls
of
the
lost
you
hear
mourning
their
doom--â€™tis
then
they
wander
up
and
down
to
and
fro
their
only
release
from
their
fearful
home
of
torture
and
undying
pain
â€œi
have
come
to
tell
you
that
you
must
go
over
to
the
old
house
and
in
the
back
room
i
always
kept
locked
have
the
carpet
taken
up
from
toward
the
fireplace
you
will
see
a
plank
with
a
knot-hole
in
it
remove
that
and
you
will
find
what
caused
me
to
lose
my
soul--have
prayers
said
for
me
for
â€™tis
well
to
pray
for
the
dead
the
money
and
jewels
give
in
charity
bury
in
holy
ground
the
others
you
find
and
pray
for
them
and
me
ah
jeannette
you
thought
your
old
friend
though
strange
and
odd
pure
and
innocent
it
is
a
bitter
part
of
my
punishment
that
i
must
change
your
thought
of
me
farewell
do
not
fail
me
and
i
shall
trouble
you
no
more
but
whenever
you
hear
that
wind
howl
and
sweep
round
the
house
as
it
does
to-night
know
that
the
lost
are
near
it
is
their
swift
flight
through
space--fleeing
before
the
scourge
of
memory
and
conscience--that
causes
that
sound
â€œthat
to-morrow
you
may
not
think
you
are
dreaming
here
is
a
tokenâ€
and
she
touched
the
palm
of
my
hand
with
her
finger-tips
and
as
you
see
my
child
to
this
day
there
are
three
crimson
spots
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
that
nothing
will
eradicate
â€œdo
not
fail
me
and
pray
for
us
jeannette
prayâ€
and
with
a
longing
wistful
gaze
and
a
deep
sobbing
sigh
nancy
black
faded
from
my
sight
â€œam
i
dreamingâ€
i
exclaimed
as
i
rose
from
my
chair
and
rang
the
bell
when
the
servant
entered
i
bade
him
attend
to
the
fire
and
light
the
lamps
and
i
went
through
the
room
to
see
if
any
unusual
arrangement
of
the
furniture
could
have
caused
the
appearance
but
nothing
was
apparent
and
i
bade
him
send
my
maid
to
attend
me
in
my
chamber
for
i
could
not
help
feeling
unwilling
to
remain
in
the
library
any
longer
that
evening
while
making
my
toilet
for
the
night
my
maid
said
â€œhave
you
burned
your
hand
madamâ€
glancing
hastily
down
i
saw
three
dark
crimson
spots
upon
the
palm
of
my
left
hand
they
had
an
odd
look
seared
as
though
touched
by
a
red-hot
iron
yet
the
flesh
was
soft
not
burned
and
not
painful
making
some
excuse
for
it
i
did
not
allude
to
it
again
and
dismissed
her
speedily
that
i
might
reflect
undisturbed
over
the
singular
occurrence
there
were
the
marks
upon
my
hand
i
could
not
remove
them
and
they
did
not
fade
in
fact
their
deep
red
made
the
rest
of
the
palm
lose
its
pinkish
hue
and
look
pale
from
the
strong
contrast
could
i
have
been
asleep
and
dreamed
it
all
and
by
any
means
have
done
this
to
myself
i
thought
but
finally
concluded
that
on
the
morrow
iâ€™d
go
over
to
nancy
blackâ€™s
old
residence
and
settle
the
question
and
with
that
conclusion
had
to
content
myself
until
the
morrow
came
nancy
black
was
an
old
friend
from
my
girlhood
who
had
owned
large
property
in
the
town
and
lived
all
alone
in
a
spacious
stone
house
directly
opposite
my
home
and
who
when
dying
had
left
me
the
sole
legatee
of
her
property
when
morning
came
i
took
the
keys
and
with
my
maid
went
over
to
nancyâ€™s
house
it
had
never
been
disturbed
since
her
death
which
was
sudden
and
somewhat
singular
and
the
furniture
remained
just
as
she
left
it
when
taken
to
her
last
resting
place
we
went
to
the
room
nancy
had
directed
i
bade
sarah
take
up
the
carpet
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
plank
with
a
knot-hole
in
it
so
i
sent
her
from
the
room
and
lifted
the
plank
myself
and
there
between
the
two
joints
rested
a
long
box
the
lid
not
fastened
opening
it
i
was
horrified
to
see
two
skeletons--those
of
an
infant
and
of
a
woman
small
in
stature
and
delicate
frame
in
a
moment
it
flashed
before
me
that
i
saw
all
that
remained
of
nancy
blackâ€™s
young
sister
a
girl
of
seventeen
who
had
left
home
somewhat
mysteriously
years
ago
and
had
died
while
absent--at
least
that
was
the
version
nancy
had
given
of
her
absence
and
no
one
had
dreamed
of
doubting
it
her
tale
was
so
naturally
told
left
orphans
when
lucy
was
only
two
years
and
nancy
eighteen
she
had
devoted
her
life
to
the
care
of
this
young
girl
and
when
she
found
her
sister
had
fallen
she
in
her
pride
of
name
and
position
had
destroyed
mother
and
child
that
her
shame
might
not
be
known
and
had
lived
all
those
dreary
years
in
that
house
with
her
fearful
secret
round
the
box
heaped
up
on
every
side
were
money
and
jewels
and
a
parchment
scroll
among
them
had
written
on
it
â€œlucyâ€™s
share
of
our
fatherâ€™s
estateâ€
i
carried
out
nancyâ€™s
wishes
to
the
letter
for
i
now
firmly
believed
that
she
had
come
to
me
herself
that
night
to
avoid
scandal
resting
on
the
dead
i
took
our
clergyman
into
my
confidence
and
with
his
assistance
had
the
remains
buried
quietly
in
consecrated
ground
the
money
and
jewels
were
given
to
the
poor
and
the
old
building
i
turned
into
a
home
for
destitute
females
and
morning
and
night
as
i
kneel
in
prayer
i
pray
forgiveness
to
rest
upon
nancy
black
and
peace
to
her
troubled
soul
a
fight
with
a
ghost
by
q
e
d
â€œno
i
never
believed
much
in
ghostsâ€
said
the
doctor
â€œbut
i
was
always
rather
afraid
of
themâ€
â€œhave
you
ever
seen
oneâ€
asked
one
of
the
other
men
the
doctor
took
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
and
contemplated
the
ash
for
a
moment
or
two
before
replying
â€œi
have
had
some
rather
startling
experiencesâ€
he
said
after
a
pause
during
which
the
rest
of
us
exchanged
glances
for
the
doctor
has
seen
many
things
and
is
not
averse
to
talking
about
them
in
congenial
company
â€œwould
you
care
about
hearing
one
of
them
it
gives
me
the
cold
shivers
now
to
speak
of
itâ€
we
nodded
and
the
doctor
taking
a
sip
as
an
antidote
to
the
shivers
began
â€œyou
remember
george
carson
who
played
for
the
â€˜varsity
some
years
ago
big
chap
with
a
light
mustache
well
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
him
before
he
married
while
he
was
reading
for
the
bar
in
town
it
was
just
after
he
became
engaged
to
miss
stonor
who
is
now
mrs
carson
that
he
asked
me
to
go
down
to
a
place
which
his
people
had
taken
in
the
country
miss
stonor
was
to
be
there
and
he
wanted
me
to
meet
her
i
could
not
go
down
for
christmas
day
as
i
had
promised
to
be
with
my
people
but
as
i
had
been
working
a
bit
too
hard
and
wanted
a
few
daysâ€™
rest
i
decided
to
run
down
for
a
few
days
about
the
new
year
â€œwoodcote
was
a
pleasant
enough
place
to
look
at
there
were
two
packs
of
hounds
within
easy
distance
and
it
was
not
far
enough
from
a
station
to
cut
you
off
completely
from
the
morning
papers
the
carsons
had
been
lucky
i
thought
in
coming
across
such
a
good
house
at
such
a
moderate
figure
for
as
george
told
me
the
owner
had
been
obliged
to
go
abroad
for
his
health
and
was
anxious
not
to
leave
the
place
empty
all
the
winter
it
was
an
old
house
with
big
gables
and
preposterous
corners
all
over
the
place
and
you
couldnâ€™t
walk
ten
paces
along
any
of
the
passages
without
tumbling
up
or
down
stairs
but
it
had
been
patched
from
time
to
time
and
among
other
improvements
a
big
billiard-room
had
been
built
out
at
the
back
a
country
house
in
the
winter
without
a
billiard-room
when
the
frost
stops
hunting
is
just--well
not
even
a
gilded
prison
the
party
was
a
small
one
besides
george
and
his
father
and
mother
there
were
only
a
couple
of
misses
carson
who
being
somewhere
in
the
early
teens
didnâ€™t
count
and
miss
stonor
who
of
course
counted
a
good
deal
and
lastly
myself
â€œmiss
stonor
ought
to
have
been
happy
for
george
carson
besides
being
an
excellent
fellow
all
around
was
by
no
means
a
bad
match
being
an
only
son
with
considerable
expectations
but
somehow
or
other
she
did
not
strike
me
as
looking
either
very
well
or
very
happy
she
gave
me
the
impression
of
having
something
on
her
mind
which
made
her
alternately
nervous
and
listless
george
i
fancied
noticed
it
and
was
puzzled
by
it
for
i
caught
him
several
times
watching
her
with
an
anxious
and
inquiring
look
but
as
i
was
not
there
as
a
doctor
of
course
it
was
no
business
of
mine
though
i
discovered
the
reason
before
i
left
woodcote
â€œthe
second
night
after
my
arrival--we
had
been
playing
i
remember
a
family
pool
the
rest
had
gone
upstairs
to
bed--george
and
i
adjourned
to
a
sort
of
study
which
he
had
arranged
upstairs
for
a
final
smoke
and
a
chat
before
turning
in
the
study
was
next
to
his
bedroom
and
parted
off
from
it
by
curtains
as
we
were
settling
down
i
missed
my
pipe
and
remembered
that
i
had
laid
it
down
in
the
billiard-room
on
principle
i
never
smoke
another
manâ€™s
pipe
so
i
lit
a
candle
the
house
being
in
darkness
and
started
away
in
search
of
my
own
the
house
looked
awfully
weird
by
the
flickering
light
of
a
solitary
candle
and
the
stairs
creaked
in
a
particularly
gruesome
way
behind
me
just
for
all
the
world
as
though
someone
were
following
at
my
heels
i
found
my
pipe
where
i
had
expected
in
the
billiard-room
and
came
back
in
perhaps
a
little
more
hurry
than
was
absolutely
necessary
which
perhaps
explains
why
i
stumbled
in
the
uncertain
light
over
a
couple
of
unforeseen
stairs
and
dropped
my
candle
of
course
it
went
out
but
after
a
little
groping
i
found
it
having
no
matches
with
me
i
was
obliged
to
feel
my
way
along
the
banisters
for
it
was
so
dark
that
i
could
not
see
my
hand
in
front
of
me
and
as
i
slowly
advanced
sliding
my
hand
along
the
broad
balustrade
at
my
side
it
suddenly
slid
over
something
cold
and
clammy
which
was
not
balustrade
at
all
for
stopping
dead
and
closing
my
fingers
round
it
for
an
instant
i
felt
that
i
was
holding
another
hand
a
skinny
bony
hand
which
writhed
itself
slowly
from
my
grasp
and
though
i
could
hear
nothing
and
see
nothing
i
was
yet
conscious
that
something
was
brushing
past
me
and
going
up
the
stairs
â€œâ€˜hi--whatâ€™s
that
who
are
youâ€™
i
called
â€œthere
was
no
answer
â€œi
admit
that
i
was
in
a
regular
funk
i
must
have
shown
it
in
my
face
â€œâ€˜whatâ€™s
the
matterâ€™
asked
george
as
i
blundered
into
his
study
â€œâ€˜oh
nothingâ€™
i
answered
â€˜dropped
my
candle
and
lost
the
wayâ€™
â€œâ€˜but
who
were
you
talking
toâ€™
â€œâ€˜i
was
only
swearing
at
the
candleâ€™
i
replied
â€œâ€˜oh
i
thought
perhaps
you
had
seen--somebodyâ€™
replied
george
â€œsomehow
i
did
not
like
to
tell
him
the
truth
for
fear
he
would
laugh
at
my
nervousness
but
i
determined
to
keep
an
eye
on
my
liver
and
take
a
couple
of
weeksâ€™
complete
rest
that
night
i
woke
up
several
times
with
the
feeling
of
that
confounded
hand
under
my
own--a
clammy
hand
which
writhed
as
my
fingers
closed
upon
it
â€œthe
next
morning
after
breakfast
i
was
in
the
billiard-room
practicing
strokes
while
carson
was
over
at
the
stables
presently
the
door
opened
and
miss
stonor
looked
in
â€œâ€˜come
inâ€™
i
said
â€˜george
will
be
back
from
the
stables
in
a
few
minutes
meanwhile
we
can
have
fifty
upâ€™
â€œâ€˜i
wanted
to
speak
to
youâ€™
she
said
â€œshe
was
looking
very
tired
and
ill
and
i
began
to
think
i
should
not
have
an
uninterrupted
holiday
after
all
â€œâ€˜do
you
believe
in
ghostsâ€™
she
asked
having
closed
the
door
and
come
up
to
the
table
where
she
stood
leaning
with
both
her
hands
upon
it
â€œâ€˜noâ€™
i
replied
missing
an
easy
carrom
as
i
remembered
my
experience
of
last
night
â€˜but
i
believe
in
fancyâ€™
â€œâ€˜and
supposing
then
that
a
person
fancied
he
saw
things
is
there
any
remedyâ€™
â€œâ€˜what
do
you
mean
miss
stonorâ€™
i
replied
looking
at
her
in
some
surprise
â€˜do
you
mean
that
you
fancy----â€™
â€œi
stopped
for
miss
stonor
turned
away
sat
down
on
one
of
the
easy-chairs
by
the
wall
and
burst
into
tears
â€œâ€˜oh
please
help
meâ€™
she
sobbed
â€˜i
believe
i
am
going
madâ€™
â€œi
laid
down
my
cue
and
went
over
to
her
â€œâ€˜look
here
miss
stonorâ€™
i
said
taking
her
hand
which
was
hot
and
feverish
â€˜i
am
a
doctor
and
a
friend
of
george
now
tell
me
all
about
it
and
iâ€™ll
do
my
best
to
set
it
rightâ€™
â€œshe
was
in
a
more
or
less
hysterical
condition
and
her
words
were
freely
punctuated
by
sobs
but
gradually
i
managed
to
elicit
from
her
that
nearly
every
night
since
she
came
to
woodcote
she
had
been
awakened
in
some
mysterious
way
and
had
seen
a
horrible
face
looking
at
her
from
over
the
top
of
a
screen
which
stood
by
the
door
of
her
bedroom
as
soon
as
she
moved
the
face
disappeared
which
convinced
her
that
the
apparition
existed
only
in
her
imagination
that
seemed
to
distress
her
even
more
than
if
she
had
believed
it
to
be
a
genuine
ghost
for
she
thought
her
brain
was
giving
way
â€œi
told
her
that
she
was
only
suffering
from
a
very
common
symptom
of
nervous
disorder
as
indeed
it
was
and
promised
to
send
a
groom
into
the
village
to
get
a
prescription
made
up
for
her
and
having
made
me
promise
to
breathe
no
word
to
anyone
on
the
subject
more
especially
to
george
she
went
away
relieved
nevertheless
i
was
not
quite
certain
that
i
had
made
a
correct
diagnosis
of
the
case
you
see
i
had
been
rather
upset
myself
not
many
hours
before
george
was
longer
than
i
expected
at
the
stable
and
i
was
just
going
to
find
him
when
at
the
door
i
met
mrs
carson
â€œâ€˜can
you
spare
me
one
momentâ€™
she
said
as
i
held
open
the
door
for
her
â€˜i
wanted
to
find
you
aloneâ€™
â€œâ€˜certainly
mrs
carson
with
pleasure
an
hour
if
you
wishâ€™
i
replied
â€œâ€˜it
is
so
convenient
you
know
to
have
a
doctor
in
the
houseâ€™
she
said
with
a
nervous
laugh
â€˜now
i
want
you
to
prescribe
me
a
sleeping
draught
my
nerves
are
rather
out
of
order
and--i
donâ€™t
sleep
as
i
shouldâ€™
â€œâ€˜ahâ€™
i
said
â€˜do
you
see
faces--and
such
like
things
when
you
wakeâ€™
â€œâ€˜how
do
you
knowâ€™
she
asked
quickly
â€œâ€˜oh
i
inferred
from
the
other
symptoms
we
doctors
have
to
observe
all
kinds
of
little
thingsâ€™
â€œâ€˜well
of
course
i
know
it
is
only
fancy
but
it
is
just
as
bad
as
if
it
were
real
i
assure
you
it
is
making
me
quite
ill
and
i
didnâ€™t
like
to
mention
it
to
mr
carson
or
to
george
they
would
think
i
was
losing
my
headâ€™
â€œi
gave
mrs
carson
the
same
prescription
as
i
had
written
for
miss
stonor
though
by
that
time
the
conviction
had
grown
upon
me
that
there
was
something
wrong
which
could
not
be
cured
by
medicine
however
i
decided
to
say
nothing
to
george
about
the
matter
at
present
for
i
could
hardly
utilize
the
confidence
which
had
been
placed
in
me
by
miss
stonor
and
mrs
carson
and
my
own
experience
of
the
night
before
would
scarcely
have
appeared
convincing
to
him
but
i
determined
that
on
the
next
day--which
was
sunday--i
would
invent
an
excuse
for
staying
at
home
from
church
and
make
some
explorations
in
the
house
there
was
obviously
some
mystery
at
work
which
wanted
clearing
up
â€œwe
all
sat
up
rather
late
that
night
there
seemed
to
be
a
general
disinclination
to
go
to
bed
we
stayed
all
together
in
the
billiard-room
until
nearly
midnight
and
then
loitered
about
in
the
hall
talking
in
an
aimless
sort
of
fashion
but
at
last
mrs
carson
said
good-night
with
a
confidential
nod
to
me
and
miss
stonor
murmured
â€˜so
many
thanks
iâ€™ve
got
itâ€™
and
they
both
went
upstairs
george
and
i
parted
in
the
corridor
above
our
rooms
were
opposite
each
other
â€œi
did
not
begin
undressing
at
once
but
sat
down
and
tried
to
piece
together
some
theory
to
account
for
the
uncanniness
of
things
but
the
more
i
thought
the
more
perplexing
it
became
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
that
i
had
put
my
hand
on
something
extremely
alive
and
extremely
unpleasant
the
night
before
the
bare
recollection
of
it
made
me
shudder
what
living
thing
could
possibly
be
creeping
about
the
house
in
the
dark
it
was
a
manâ€™s
hand
of
that
i
was
certain
from
the
size
of
it
george
carson
was
out
of
the
question
for
he
was
in
his
room
all
the
time
nor
was
it
likely
that
mr
carson
senior
would
steal
about
his
own
house
in
his
socks
and
refuse
to
answer
when
spoken
to
the
only
other
man
in
the
house
was
an
eminently
respectable-looking
butler
and
his
hand
as
i
had
noted
particularly
when
he
poured
out
my
wine
at
dinner
was
plump
and
soft
whereas
the
mysterious
hand
on
the
balustrade
was
thin
and
bony
and
then
what
was
the
real
explanation
of
the
face
which
had
appeared
to
the
two
ladies
indigestion
might
have
explained
either
singly
extraordinary
coincidences
do
sometimes
occur
but
it
seemed
too
extraordinary
that
a
couple
of
ladies--one
old
and
one
young--should
suffer
from
the
same
indigestion
in
the
same
house
at
the
same
time
and
with
the
same
symptoms
on
the
whole
i
did
not
feel
at
all
comfortable
and
looked
carefully
in
all
the
cupboards
and
recesses
as
well
as
under
the
bed
before
starting
to
undress
then
i
went
to
the
door
intending
to
lock
it
just
as
my
hand
was
upon
the
key
i
heard
a
soft
step
in
the
corridor
outside
accompanied
by
a
sound
which
was
something
between
a
sigh
and
a
groan
very
faint
but
quite
unmistakable
and
under
the
circumstances
discomposing
it
might
of
course
be
george
anyhow
i
decided
to
look
and
see
i
turned
the
handle
gently
and
opened
the
door
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
in
the
corridor
but
on
the
opposite
side
i
could
see
a
door
open
and
georgeâ€™s
head
peeping
round
the
corner
â€œâ€˜hulloâ€™
he
said
â€œâ€˜hulloâ€™
i
replied
â€œâ€˜was
that
you
walking
up
the
passageâ€™
he
asked
â€œâ€˜noâ€™
i
answered
â€˜i
thought
it
might
be
youâ€™
â€œâ€˜then
who
the
devil
was
itâ€™
he
said
â€˜iâ€™ll
swear
i
heard
someoneâ€™
â€œthere
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
i
was
wondering
whether
i
had
better
tell
him
of
the
fright
i
had
already
had
when
he
spoke
again
â€œâ€˜i
say
just
come
here
for
a
bit
old
fellow
i
want
to
speak
to
youâ€™
â€œi
stepped
across
the
passage
and
we
went
together
into
the
little
study
which
adjoined
his
bedroom
â€œâ€˜look
hereâ€™
he
said
poking
up
the
fire
which
was
burning
low
â€˜doesnâ€™t
it
strike
you
that
there
is
something
very
odd
about
this
houseâ€™
â€œâ€˜you
mean----â€™
â€œâ€˜well
i
wouldnâ€™t
say
anything
about
it
to
the
master
or
miss
stonor
for
fear
of
frightening
them
all
the
same
scarcely
a
night
passes
but
i
hear
curious
footsteps
on
the
stairs
youâ€™ve
heard
them
yourself
havenâ€™t
youâ€™
â€œâ€˜now
you
mention
itâ€™
i
said
â€˜i
confess
i
haveâ€™
â€œâ€˜and
what
is
moreâ€™
he
continued
â€˜i
was
sitting
here
two
nights
ago
half
asleep
and--it
seems
ridiculous
i
know
but
itâ€™s
a
fact--i
suddenly
saw
a
horrible
face
glaring
at
me
from
between
those
curtains
behind
you
it
was
gone
in
a
moment
but
i
saw
it
as
plainly
as
i
see
youâ€™
â€œi
moved
my
seat
uneasily
â€œâ€˜did
you
look
in
your
bedroom
or
in
the
passageâ€™
i
asked
â€œâ€˜yes--at
onceâ€™
he
replied
â€˜there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
twice
again
that
night
i
heard
footsteps
passing--good
godâ€™
â€œhe
started
up
in
his
chair
staring
straight
over
my
shoulder
i
turned
quickly
and
saw
the
curtains
which
parted
off
the
bedroom
swing
together
â€œâ€˜what
is
itâ€™
i
asked
breathlessly
â€œâ€˜i
saw
it
again--the
same
face--between
the
curtainsâ€™
â€œi
tore
the
hangings
aside
and
rushed
into
the
next
room
it
was
empty
the
lamp
was
burning
upon
a
side
table
and
the
door
was
open
just
as
george
had
left
it
in
the
passage
outside
all
was
quiet
i
came
back
into
the
study
and
found
george
running
his
fingers
through
his
hair
in
perplexity
â€œâ€˜there
is
clearly
one
person
too
many
in
the
houseâ€™
i
said
â€˜i
think
we
ought
to
draw
the
place
and
find
out
who
it
isâ€™
â€œâ€˜all
rightâ€™
said
he
picking
up
the
poker
from
the
fireplace
â€˜if
itâ€™s
anything
made
of
flesh
and
blood
this
will
be
useful
and
if
not----â€™
â€œhe
stopped
short
for
at
that
instant
the
most
awful
shriek
of
horror
rang
through
the
house--a
shriek
of
wild
uncontrollable
terror
such
as
i
had
never
heard
before
and
i
never
hope
to
hear
again
one
moment
we
stood
staring
at
each
other
dumbfounded
the
next
george
carson
had
dashed
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
corridor
to
the
stairs
i
followed
close
behind
him
for
we
both
knew
that
none
but
a
woman
in
mortal
fear
would
shriek
like
that
and
that
that
woman
was
miss
stonor
â€œdown
the
stairs
we
tumbled
pell-mell
in
the
darkness
but
before
i
reached
the
landing
below
where
miss
stonorâ€™s
room
was
i
felt
as
i
had
felt
the
evening
before
something
brush
swiftly
past
me
as
i
ran
i
turned
and
caught
at
it
in
the
dark
but
my
hand
gripped
only
empty
air
i
was
just
about
to
turn
back
and
follow
it
when
a
cry
from
george
arrested
me
and
looking
down
i
saw
him
standing
over
the
prostrate
form
of
miss
stonor
the
door
of
her
room
was
open
and
by
the
moonlight
which
streamed
into
the
room
i
could
see
her
lying
in
her
white
nightdress
across
the
threshold
what
followed
in
the
next
few
minutes
i
can
scarcely
recall
with
accuracy
the
whole
house
was
aroused
by
the
poor
girlâ€™s
awful
shriek
she
was
quite
unconscious
when
we
came
upon
her
but
she
revived
more
or
less
as
soon
as
mrs
carson
and
one
of
the
terrified
servants
had
lifted
her
into
bed
again
nothing
intelligible
could
be
gathered
from
her
however
as
to
the
cause
of
her
fright
she
only
repeated
hysterically
again
and
again
â€œâ€˜oh
the
face
the
faceâ€™
â€œwhen
i
saw
i
could
do
her
no
further
good
for
the
present
i
took
george
by
the
arm
and
led
him
out
of
the
room
â€œâ€˜look
here
georgeâ€™
i
said
â€˜we
must
find
out
the
reason
of
this
at
once
i
am
certain
i
felt
something
go
by
me
as
i
came
downstairs
now
does
that
staircase
lead
anywhere
but
to
our
roomsâ€™
â€œgeorge
considered
for
a
moment
â€œâ€˜yesâ€™
he
replied
â€˜there
is
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
which
leads
up
into
a
sort
of
lumber
roomâ€™
â€œâ€˜then
weâ€™ll
explore
itâ€™
i
said
â€˜for
my
part
i
canâ€™t
go
to
sleep
until
iâ€™ve
got
to
the
bottom
of
this
get
the
man
to
bring
a
lantern
alongâ€™
â€œthe
butler
looked
as
though
he
didnâ€™t
half
like
the
enterprise
and
to
tell
the
truth
no
more
did
i
it
was
the
uncanniest
job
i
ever
undertook
however
we
started
the
three
of
us
first
of
all
we
searched
the
rooms
on
the
floor
above
where
george
and
i
slept
everything
was
just
as
we
had
left
it
then
i
pushed
open
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
a
crazy-looking
staircase
led
up
into
darkness
we
went
cautiously
up
i
first
with
a
candle
then
george
and
last
of
all
the
butler
with
a
lantern
at
the
top
we
stepped
into
a
big
rather
low
room
with
beams
across
the
ceiling
and
a
rough
uneven
floor
our
lights
threw
strange
shadows
into
the
corners
and
more
than
once
i
started
at
what
looked
like
a
crouching
human
figure
we
searched
every
corner
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
a
few
old
boxes
a
roll
or
two
of
matting
and
some
broken
chairs
but
in
the
far
corner
george
pointed
out
to
me
a
rickety
ladder
which
ended
at
a
closed
trap-door
just
then
i
distinctly
heard
the
curious
half
groaning
half
sighing
sound
which
had
already
puzzled
me
in
the
corridor
below
we
stood
still
and
looked
at
one
another
we
all
heard
the
sound
â€œâ€˜whatever
it
is
itâ€™s
up
thereâ€™
i
said
â€˜the
question
is
who
is
going
upâ€™
â€œgeorge
put
his
candle
down
upon
the
floor
and
stepped
upon
the
ladder
it
cracked
beneath
his
weight
he
stopped
â€œâ€˜come
down
it
wonâ€™t
bear
youâ€™
i
said
â€˜i
shall
have
to
goâ€™
â€œi
donâ€™t
know
that
i
was
ever
in
such
a
queer
funk
as
i
was
while
i
slowly
mounted
that
ladder
and
pushed
open
the
trap-door
i
had
formed
no
clear
idea
of
what
i
expected
to
find
there
certainly
i
was
not
prepared
for
what
happened
for
no
sooner
was
the
trap-door
fully
open
than
there
fell--literally
fell--upon
me
from
the
darkness
above
a
thing
in
human
shape
which
kicked
and
spat
and
tore
at
me
as
i
stood
clinging
to
the
ladder
it
lasted
but
a
moment
or
so
but
in
that
moment
i
lived
a
lifetime
of
terror
the
ladder
swayed
and
cracked
beneath
me
and
i
fell
to
the
floor
with
the
thing
gripping
my
throat
like
a
vise
the
next
instant
george
had
stunned
it
with
a
blow
from
the
poker
and
dragged
it
off
me
it
lay
upon
its
back
on
the
floor--a
ragged
hideous
loathsome
shape
and
the
mystery
was
solvedâ€
â€œbut
you
havenâ€™t
told
us
what
it
really
wasâ€
said
one
of
the
listeners
the
doctor
smiled
â€œit
was
the
owner
of
the
houseâ€
he
replied
â€œhe
had
not
gone
abroad
he
had
gone
to
a
private
lunatic
asylum
with
homicidal
mania
upon
him
about
a
fortnight
before
this
he
had
managed
to
escape
and
having
made
his
way
to
his
former
home
had
concealed
himself
with
a
cunning
often
shown
by
lunatics
in
the
loft
i
suppose
he
had
found
enough
to
eat
in
his
nightly
rambles
about
the
house
the
only
wonder
is
that
he
didnâ€™t
kill
someone
before
he
was
caughtâ€

ghost
story
i
had
just
come
back
to
england
after
having
been
some
years
in
india
and
was
looking
forward
to
meet
my
friends
among
whom
there
was
none
i
was
more
anxious
to
see
than
sir
francis
lynton
we
had
been
to
eton
together
and
for
the
short
time
i
had
been
at
oxford
before
entering
the
army
we
had
been
at
the
same
college
then
we
had
parted

came
into
the
title
and
estates
of
the
family
in
yorkshire
on
the
death
of
his
grandfather--his
father
had
predeceased--and
i
had
been
over
a
good
part
of
the
world
one
visit
indeed
i
had
made
him
in
his
yorkshire
home
before
leaving
for
india
of
but
a
few
days
it
will
be
easily
imagined
how
pleasant
it
was
two
or
three
days
after
my
arrival
in
london
to
receive
a
letter
from
lynton
saying
that
he
had
just
seen
in
the
papers
that
i
had
arrived
and
begging
me
to
come
down
at
once
to
byfield
his
place
in
yorkshire
â€œyou
are
not
to
tell
meâ€
he
said
â€œthat
you
cannot
come
in
fact
you
are
to
come
on
monday
i
have
a
couple
of
horses
which
will
just
suit

shall
meet
you
at

all
you
have
got
to
do
is
to
put
yourself
in

which
leaves

cross
at
twelve
oâ€™clockâ€
accordingly
on
the
day
appointed
i
started
in
due
time
reached
packham
losing
much
time
on
a
detestable
branch
line
and
there
found
the
dog-cart
of
sir

awaiting
me
i
drove
at
once
to
byfield
the
house
i
remembered
it
was
a
low
gable
structure
of
no
great
size
with
old-fashioned
lattice
windows
separated
from
the
park
where
were
deer
by
a
charming
terraced
garden
no
sooner
did
the
wheels
crunch
the
gravel
by
the
principal
entrance
than
almost
before
the
bell
was
rung
the
porch-door
opened
and
there
stood
lynton
himself
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
so
many
years
hardly
altered
and
with
all
the
joy
of
welcome
beaming
in
his
face
taking
me
by
both
hands
he
drew
me
into
the
house
got
rid
of
my
hat
and
wraps
looked
me
all
over
and
then
in
a
breath
began
to
say
how
glad
he
was
to
see
me
what
a
real
delight
it
was
to
have
got
me
at
last
under
his
roof
and
what
a
good
time
we
would
have
together
like
the
old
days
over
again
he
had
sent
my
luggage
up
to
my
room
which
was
ready
for
me
and
he
bade
me
make
haste
and
dress
for
dinner
so
saying
he
took
me
through
a
paneled
hall
up
an
old
oak
staircase
and
showed
me
my
room
which
hurried
as
i
was
i
observed
was
hung
with
tapestry
and
had
a
large
four-post
bed
with
velvet
curtains
opposite
the
window
they
had
gone
in
to
dinner
when
i
came
down
despite
all
the
haste
i
made
in
dressing
but
a
place
had
been
kept
for
me
next
lady
lynton
besides
my
hosts
there
were
their
two
daughters
colonel
lynton
a
brother
of
sir
francis
the
chaplain
and
some
others
whom
i
do
not
remember
distinctly
after
dinner
there
was
some
music
in
the
hall
and
a
game
of
whist
in
the
drawing-room
and
after
the
ladies
had
gone
upstairs
lynton
and
i
retired
to
the
smoking-room
where
we
sat
up
talking
the
better
part
of
the
night
i
think
it
must
have
been
near
three
when
i
retired
once
in
bed
i
slept
so
soundly
that
my
servantâ€™s
entrance
the
next
morning
failed
to
arouse
me
and
it
was
past
nine
when
i
awoke
after
breakfast
and
the
disposal
of
the
newspapers
lynton
retired
to
his
letters
and
i
asked
lady
lynton
if
one
of
her
daughters
might
show
me
the
house
elizabeth
the
eldest
was
summoned
and
seemed
in
no
way
to
dislike
the
task
the
house
was
as
already
intimated
by
no
means
large
it
occupied
three
sides
of
a
square
the
entrance
and
one
end
of
the
stables
making
the
fourth
side
the
interior
was
full
of
interest--passages
rooms
galleries
as
well
as
hall
were
paneled
in
dark
wood
and
hung
with
pictures
i
was
shown
everything
on
the
ground
illustration
â€œlosing
much
time
on
a
detestable
branch
lineâ€
floor
and
then
on
the
first
floor
then
my
guide
proposed
that
we
should
ascend
a
narrow
twisting
staircase
that
led
to
a
gallery
we
did
as
proposed
and
entered
a
handsome
long
room
or
passage
leading
to
a
small
chamber
at
one
end
in
which
my
guide
told
me
her
father
kept
books
and
papers
i
asked
if
anyone
slept
in
this
gallery
as
i
noticed
a
bed
and
fireplace
and
rods
by
means
of
which
curtains
might
be
drawn
enclosing
one
portion
where
were
bed
and
fireplace
so
as
to
convert
it
into
a
very
cosy
chamber
she
answered
â€œnoâ€
the
place
was
not
really
used
except
as
a
playroom
though
sometimes
if
the
house
happened
to
be
very
full--in
her
great-grandfatherâ€™s
time--she
had
heard
that
it
had
been
occupied
by
the
time
we
had
been
over
the
house
and
i
had
also
been
shown
the
garden
and
the
stables
and
introduced
to
the
dogs
it
was
nearly
one
oâ€™clock
we
were
to
have
an
early
luncheon
and
to
drive
afterwards
to
see
the
ruins
of
one
of
the
grand
old
yorkshire
abbeys
this
was
a
pleasant
expedition
and
we
got
back
just
in
time
for
tea
after
which
there
was
some
reading
aloud
the
evening
passed
much
in
the
same
way
as
the
preceding
one
except
that
lynton
who
had
some
business
did
not
go
down
into
the
smoking-room
and
i
took
the
opportunity
of
retiring
early
in
order
to
write
a
letter
for
the
indian
mail
something
having
been
said
as
to
the
prospect
of
hunting
the
next
day
i
had
finished
my
letter
which
was
a
long
one
together
with
two
or
three
others
and
had
just
got
into
bed
when
i
heard
a
step
overhead
as
of
someone
walking
along
the
gallery
which
i
now
knew
ran
immediately
above
my
room
it
was
a
slow
heavy
measured
tread
which
i
could
hear
getting
gradually
louder
and
nearer
and
then
as
gradually
fading
away
as
it
retreated
into
the
distance
i
was
startled
for
a
moment
having
been
told
that
the
gallery
was
unused
but
the
next
instant
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
been
told
it
communicated
with
a
chamber
where
sir
francis
kept
books
and
papers
i
knew
he
had
some
writing
to
do
and
i
thought
no
more
on
the
matter
i
was
down
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
in
good
time
â€œhow
late
you
were
last
nightâ€
i
said
to
lynton
in
the
middle
of
breakfast
â€œi
heard
you
overhead
after
one
oâ€™clockâ€
lynton
replied
rather
shortly
â€œindeed
you
did
not
for
i
was
in
bed
last
night
before
twelveâ€
â€œthere
was
someone
certainly
moving
overhead
last
nightâ€
i
answered
â€œfor
i
heard
his
steps
as
distinctly
as
i
ever
heard
anything
in
my
life
going
down
the
galleryâ€
upon
which
colonel
lynton
remarked
that
he
had
often
fancied
he
had
heard
steps
on
the
staircase
when
he
knew
that
no
one
was
about
he
was
apparently
disposed
to
say
more
when
his
brother
interrupted
him
somewhat
curtly
as
i
fancied
and
asked
me
if
i
should
feel
inclined
after
breakfast
to
have
a
horse
and
go
out
and
look
for
the
hounds
they
met
a
considerable
way
off
but
if
they
did
not
find
in
the
coverts
they
would
first
draw
a
thing
not
improbable
they
would
come
our
way
and
we
might
fall
in
with
them
about
one
oâ€™clock
and
have
a
run
i
said
there
was
nothing
i
should
like
better
lynton
mounted
me
on
a
very
nice
chestnut
and
the
rest
of
the
party
having
gone
out
shooting
and
the
young
ladies
being
otherwise
engaged
he
and
i
started
about
eleven
oâ€™clock
for
our
ride
it
was
a
beautiful
day
soft
with
a
bright
sun
one
of
those
beautiful
days
which
so
frequently
occur
in
the
early
part
of
november
on
reaching
the
hilltop
where
lynton
had
expected
to
meet
the
hounds
no
trace
of
them
was
to
be
discovered
they
must
have
found
at
once
and
run
in
a
different
direction
at
three
oâ€™clock
after
we
had
eaten
our
sandwiches
lynton
reluctantly
abandoned
all
hopes
of
falling
in
with
the
hounds
and
said
we
would
return
home
by
a
slightly
different
route
we
had
not
descended
the
hill
before
we
came
on
an
old
chalk
quarry
and
the
remains
of
a
disused
kiln
i
recollected
the
spot
at
once
i
had
been
here
with
sir
francis
on
my
former
visit
many
years
ago
â€œwhy
bless
meâ€
said
i
â€œdo
you
remember
lynton
what
happened
here
when
i
was
with
you
before
there
had
been
men
engaged
removing
chalk
and
they
came
on
a
skeleton
under
some
depth
of
rubble
we
went
together
to
see
it
removed
and
you
said
you
would
have
it
preserved
till
it
could
be
examined
by
some
ethnologist
or
anthropologist
any
one
of
those
dry-as-dusts
to
decide
whether
the
remains
were
dolichocephalous
or
brachycephalous--whether
british
danish
or--modern
what
was
the
resultâ€
sir
francis
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
answered
â€œit
is
true
i
had
the
remains
removedâ€
â€œwas
there
an
inquestâ€
â€œno
i
had
been
opening
some
of
the
tumuli
on
the
wolds
i
had
sent
a
crouched
skeleton
and
some
skulls
to
the
scarsborough
museum
this
i
was
doubtful
about--whether
it
was
a
prehistoric
interment--in
fact
to
what
date
it
belonged
no
one
thought
of
an
inquestâ€
on
reaching
the
house
one
of
the
grooms
who
took
the
horses
in
answer
to
a
question
from
lynton
said
that
colonel
and
mrs
hampshire
had
arrived
about
an
hour
ago
and
that
one
of
the
horses
being
lame
the
carriage
in
which
they
had
driven
over
from
castle
frampton
was
to
put
up
for
the
night
in
the
drawing-room
we
found
lady
lynton
pouring
out
tea
for
her
husbandâ€™s
sister
and
her
husband
who
as
we
came
in
exclaimed
â€œwe
have
come
to
beg
a
nightâ€™s
lodgingâ€
it
appeared
that
they
had
been
on
a
visit
in
the
neighborhood
and
had
been
obliged
to
leave
at
a
momentâ€™s
notice
in
consequence
of
a
sudden
death
in
the
house
where
they
were
staying
and
that
in
the
impossibility
of
getting
a
fly
their
hosts
had
sent
them
over
to
byfield
â€œwe
thoughtâ€
mrs
hampshire
went
on
to
say
â€œthat
as
we
were
coming
here
the
end
of
next
week
you
would
not
mind
having
us
a
little
sooner
or
that
if
the
house
were
quite
full
you
would
be
willing
to
put
us
up
anywhere
till
monday
and
let
us
come
back
laterâ€
lady
lynton
interposed
with
the
remark
that
it
was
all
settled
and
then
turning
to
her
husband
added
â€œbut
i
want
to
speak
to
you
for
a
momentâ€
they
both
left
the
room
together
lynton
came
back
almost
immediately
and
making
an
excuse
to
show
me
on
a
map
in
the
hall
the
point
to
which
we
had
ridden
said
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
with
a
look
of
considerable
annoyance
â€œi
am
afraid
we
must
ask
you
to
change
your
room
shall
you
mind
very
much
i
think
we
can
make
you
quite
comfortable
upstairs
in
the
gallery
which
is
the
only
room
available
lady
lynton
has
had
a
good
fire
lit
the
place
is
really
not
cold
and
it
will
be
only
for
a
night
or
two
your
servant
has
been
told
to
put
your
things
together
but
lady
lynton
did
not
like
to
give
orders
to
have
them
actually
moved
before
my
speaking
to
youâ€
i
assured
him
that
i
did
not
mind
in
the
very
least
that
i
should
be
quite
as
comfortable
upstairs
but
that
i
did
mind
very
much
their
making
such
a
fuss
about
a
matter
of
that
sort
with
an
old
friend
like
myself
certainly
nothing
could
look
more
comfortable
than
my
new
lodging
when
i
went
upstairs
to
dress
there
was
a
bright
fire
in
the
large
grate
an
arm-chair
had
been
drawn
up
beside
it
and
all
my
books
and
writing
things
had
been
put
in
with
a
reading-lamp
in
the
central
position
and
the
heavy
tapestry
curtains
were
drawn
converting
this
part
of
the
gallery
into
a
room
to
itself
indeed
i
felt
somewhat
inclined
to
congratulate
myself
on
the
change
the
spiral
staircase
had
been
one
reason
against
this
place
having
been
given
to
the
hampshires
no
ladyâ€™s
long
dress
trunk
could
have
mounted
it
sir
francis
was
necessarily
a
good
deal
occupied
in
the
evening
with
his
sister
and
her
husband
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
some
time
colonel
hampshire
had
also
just
heard
that
he
was
likely
to
be
ordered
to
egypt
and
when
lynton
and
he
retired
to
the
smoking-room
instead
of
going
there
i
went
upstairs
to
my
own
room
to
finish
a
book
in
which
i
was
interested
i
did
not
however
sit
up
long
and
very
soon
went
to
bed
before
doing
so
i
drew
back
the
curtains
on
the
rods
partly
because
i
like
plenty
of
air
where
i
sleep
and
partly
also
because
i
thought
i
might
like
to
see
the
play
of
the
moonlight
on
the
floor
in
the
portion
of
the
gallery
beyond
where
i
lay
and
where
the
blinds
had
not
been
drawn
i
must
have
been
asleep
for
some
time
for
the
fire
which
i
had
left
in
full
blaze
was
gone
to
a
few
sparks
wandering
among
the
ashes
when
i
suddenly
awoke
with
the
impression
of
having
heard
a
latch
click
at
the
further
extremity
of
the
gallery
where
was
the
chamber
containing
books
and
papers
i
had
always
been
a
light
sleeper
but
on
the
present
occasion
i
woke
at
once
to
complete
and
acute
consciousness
and
with
a
sense
of
stretched
attention
which
seemed
to
intensify
all
my
faculties
the
wind
had
risen
and
was
blowing
in
fitful
gusts
round
the
house
a
minute
or
two
passed
and
i
began
almost
to
fancy
i
must
have
been
mistaken
when
i
distinctly
heard
the
creak
of
the
door
and
then
the
click
of
the
latch
falling
back
into
place
then
i
heard
a
sound
on
the
boards
as
of
one
moving
in
the
gallery
i
sat
up
to
listen
and
as
i
did
so
i
distinctly
heard
steps
coming
down
the
gallery
illustration
â€œwho
are
youâ€
i
heard
them
approach
and
pass
my
bed
i
could
see
nothing
all
was
dark
but
i
heard
the
tread
proceeding
toward
where
were
the
uncurtained
and
unshuttered
windows
two
in
number
but
the
moon
shone
through
only
one
of
these
the
nearest--the
other
was
dark
shadowed
by
the
chapel
or
some
other
building
at
right
angles
the
tread
seemed
to
me
to
pause
now
and
again
and
then
continue
as
before
i
now
fixed
my
eyes
intently
on
the
one
illumined
window
and
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
some
dark
body
passed
across
it
but
what
i
listened
intently
and
heard
the
step
proceed
to
the
end
of
the
gallery
and
then
return
i
again
watched
the
lighted
window
and
immediately
that
the
sound
reached
that
portion
of
the
long
passage
it
ceased
momentarily
and
i
saw
as
distinctly
as
i
ever
saw
anything
in
my
life
by
moonlight
a
figure
of
a
man
with
marked
features
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
fur
cap
drawn
over
the
brows
it
stood
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
and
the
outline
of
the
face
was
in
silhouette
then
it
moved
on
and
as
it
moved
i
again
heard
the
tread
i
was
as
certain
as
i
could
be
that
the
thing
whatever
it
was
or
the
person
whoever
he
was
was
approaching
my
bed
i
threw
myself
back
in
the
bed
and
as
i
did
see
a
mass
of
charred
wood
on
the
hearth
fell
down
and
sent
up
a
flash
of--i
fancy
sparks
that
gave
out
a
glare
into
the
darkness
and
by
that--red
as
blood--i
saw
a
face
near
me
with
a
cry
over
which
i
had
as
little
control
as
the
scream
uttered
by
a
sleeper
in
the
agony
of
a
nightmare
i
called
â€œwho
are
youâ€
there
was
an
instant
during
which
my
hair
bristled
on
my
head
as
in
the
horror
of
the
darkness
i
prepared
to
grapple
with
the
being
at
my
side
when
a
board
creaked
as
if
someone
had
moved
and
i
heard
the
footsteps
retreat
and
again
the
click
of
the
latch
the
next
instant
there
was
a
rush
on
the
stairs
and
lynton
burst
into
the
room
just
as
he
had
sprung
out
of
bed
crying
â€œfor
godâ€™s
sake
what
is
the
matter
are
you
illâ€
i
could
not
answer
lynton
struck
a
light
and
leaned
over
the
bed
then
i
seized
him
by
the
arm
and
said
without
moving
â€œthere
has
been
something
in
this
room--gone
in
thitherâ€
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
my
mouth
when
lynton
following
the
direction
of
my
eyes
had
sprung
to
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
thrown
open
the
door
there
he
went
into
the
room
beyond
looked
round
it
returned
and
said
â€œyou
must
have
been
dreamingâ€
by
this
time
i
was
out
of
bed
â€œlook
for
yourselfâ€
said
he
and
he
led
me
into
the
little
room
it
was
bare
with
cupboards
and
boxes
a
sort
of
lumber
place
â€œthere
is
nothing
beyond
thisâ€
said
he
â€œno
door
no
staircase
it
is
a
blind
wayâ€
then
he
added
â€œnow
pull
on
your
dressing-gown
and
come
downstairs
to
my
sanctumâ€
i
followed
him
and
after
he
had
spoken
to
lady
lynton
who
was
standing
with
the
door
of
her
room
ajar
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
he
turned
to
me
and
said
â€œno
one
can
have
been
in
your
room
you
see
my
and
my
wifeâ€™s
apartments
are
close
below
and
no
one
could
come
up
the
spiral
staircase
without
passing
my
door
you
must
have
had
a
nightmare
directly
you
screamed
i
rushed
up
the
steps
and
met
no
one
descending
and
there
is
no
place
of
concealment
in
the
lumber-room
at
the
end
of
the
galleryâ€
then
he
took
me
into
his
private
snuggery
blew
up
the
fire
lighted
a
lamp
and
said
â€œi
shall
be
really
grateful
if
you
will
say
nothing
about
this
there
are
some
in
the
house
and
neighborhood
who
are
silly
enough
as
it
is
you
stay
here
and
if
you
do
not
feel
inclined
to
go
to
bed
read--here
are
books
i
must
go
to
lady
lynton
who
is
a
good
deal
frightened
and
does
not
like
to
be
left
aloneâ€
he
then
went
to
his
bedroom
sleep
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
was
out
of
the
question
nor
do
i
think
sir
francis
and
his
wife
slept
much
either
i
made
up
the
fire
and
after
a
time
took
up
a
book
and
tried
to
read
but
it
was
useless
i
sat
absorbed
in
thoughts
and
questionings
till
i
heard
the
servants
stirring
in
the
morning
i
went
to
my
own
room
left
the
candle
burning
and
got
into
bed
i
had
just
fallen
asleep
when
my
servant
brought
me
a
cup
of
tea
at
eight
oâ€™clock
at
breakfast
colonel
hampshire
and
his
wife
asked
if
anything
had
happened
in
the
night
as
they
had
been
much
disturbed
by
noises
overhead
to
which
lynton
replied
that
i
had
not
been
very
well
and
had
an
attack
of
cramp
and
that
he
had
been
upstairs
to
look
after
me
from
his
manner
i
could
see
that
he
wished
me
to
be
silent
and
i
said
nothing
accordingly
in
the
afternoon
when
everyone
had
gone
out
sir
francis
took
me
into
his
snuggery
and
said
â€œhalifax
i
am
very
sorry
about
that
matter
last
night
it
is
quite
true
what
my
brother
said
that
steps
have
been
heard
about
this
house
but
i
never
gave
heed
to
such
things
putting
all
noises
down
to
rats
but
after
your
experiences
i
feel
that
it
is
due
to
you
to
tell
you
something
and
also
to
make
to
you
an
explanation
there
is--there
was--no
one
in
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
except
the
skeleton
that
was
discovered
in
the
chalk-pit
when
you
were
here
many
years
ago
i
confess
i
had
not
paid
much
heed
to
it
my
archã¦ological
fancies
passed
i
had
no
visits
from
anthropologists
the
bones
and
skull
were
never
shown
to
experts
but
remain
packed
in
a
chest
in
that
lumber-room
i
confess
i
ought
to
have
buried
them
having
no
more
scientific
use
for
them
but
i
did
not--on
my
word
i
forgot
all
about
them
or
at
least
gave
no
heed
to
them
however
what
you
have
gone
through
and
have
described
to
me
has
made
me
uneasy
and
has
also
given
me
a
suspicion
that
i
can
account
for
that
body
in
a
manner
that
had
never
occurred
to
me
beforeâ€
after
a
pause
he
added
â€œwhat
i
am
going
to
tell
you
is
known
to
no
one
else
and
must
not
be
mentioned
by
you--anyhow
in
my
lifetime
you
know
now
that
owing
to
the
death
of
my
father
when
quite
young
i
and
my
brother
and
sister
were
brought
up
here
with
our
grandfather
sir
richard
he
was
an
old
imperious
hot-tempered
man
i
will
tell
you
what
i
have
made
out
of
a
matter
that
was
a
mystery
for
long
and
i
will
tell
you
afterwards
how
i
came
to
unravel
it
my
grandfather
was
in
the
habit
of
going
out
at
night
with
a
young
under-keeper
of
whom
he
was
very
fond
to
look
after
the
game
and
see
if
any
poachers
whom
he
regarded
as
his
natural
enemies
were
about
â€œone
night
as
i
suppose
my
grandfather
had
been
out
with
the
young
man
in
question
and
returning
by
the
plantations
where
the
hill
is
steepest
and
not
far
from
the
chalk-pit
you
illustration
â€œhe
and
the
keeper
buried
the
bodyâ€
remarked
on
yesterday
they
came
upon
a
man
who
though
not
actually
belonging
to
the
country
was
well
known
in
it
as
a
sort
of
traveling
tinker
of
indifferent
character
and
a
notorious
poacher
mind
this
i
am
not
sure
it
was
at
the
place
i
mention
i
only
now
surmise
it
on
the
particular
night
in
question
my
grandfather
and
the
keeper
must
have
caught
this
man
setting
snares
there
must
have
been
a
tussle
in
the
course
of
which
as
subsequent
circumstances
have
led
me
to
imagine
the
man
showed
fight
and
was
knocked
down
by
one
or
the
other
of
the
two--my
grandfather
or
the
keeper
i
believe
that
after
having
made
various
attempts
to
restore
him
they
found
that
the
man
was
actually
dead
â€œthey
were
both
in
great
alarm
and
concern--my
grandfather
especially
he
had
been
prominent
in
putting
down
some
factory
riots
and
had
given
orders
to
the
military
to
fire
whereby
several
lives
had
been
lost
there
was
a
vast
outcry
against
him
and
a
certain
political
party
had
denounced
him
as
an
assassin
no
man
was
more
vituperated
yet
now
in
my
conscience
i
believe
he
acted
with
both
discretion
and
pluck
and
arrested
a
mischievous
movement
that
might
have
led
to
much
bloodshed
be
that
as
it
may
my
impression
is
that
he
lost
his
head
over
this
fatal
affair
with
the
tinker
and
that
he
and
the
keeper
together
buried
the
body
secretly
not
far
from
the
place
where
he
was
killed
i
now
think
it
was
in
the
chalk-pit
and
that
the
skeleton
found
years
after
there
belonged
to
this
manâ€
â€œgood
heavensâ€
i
exclaimed
as
at
once
my
mind
rushed
back
to
the
figure
with
the
fur
cap
that
i
had
seen
against
the
window
sir
francis
went
on
â€œthe
sudden
disappearance
of
the
tramp
in
view
of
his
well-known
habits
and
wandering
mode
of
life
did
not
for
some
time
excite
surprise
but
later
on
one
or
two
circumstances
having
led
to
suspicion
an
inquiry
was
set
on
foot
and
among
others
my
grandfatherâ€™s
keepers
were
examined
before
the
magistrates
it
was
remembered
afterwards
that
the
under-keeper
in
question
was
absent
at
the
time
of
the
inquiry
my
grandfather
having
sent
him
with
some
dogs
to
a
brother-in-law
of
his
who
lived
upon
the
moors
but
whether
anyone
noticed
the
fact
or
if
they
did
preferred
to
be
silent
no
observations
were
made
nothing
came
of
the
investigation
and
the
whole
subject
would
have
been
dropped
if
it
had
not
been
that
two
years
later
for
some
reasons
i
do
not
understand
but
at
the
instigation
of
a
magistrate
recently
imported
into
the
division
whom
my
grandfather
greatly
disliked
and
who
was
opposed
to
him
in
politics
a
fresh
inquiry
was
instituted
in
the
course
of
that
inquiry
it
transpired
that
owing
to
some
unguarded
words
dropped
by
the
under-keeper
a
warrant
was
about
to
be
issued
for
his
arrest
my
grandfather
who
had
a
fit
of
the
gout
was
away
from
home
at
the
time
but
on
hearing
the
news
he
came
home
at
once
the
evening
he
returned
he
had
a
long
interview
with
the
young
man
who
left
the
house
after
he
had
supped
in
the
servantsâ€™
hall
it
was
observed
that
he
looked
much
depressed
the
warrant
was
issued
the
next
day
but
in
the
meantime
the
keeper
had
disappeared
my
grandfather
gave
orders
to
his
people
to
do
everything
in
their
power
to
assist
the
authorities
in
the
search
that
was
at
once
set
on
foot
but
was
unable
himself
to
take
any
share
in
it
â€œno
trace
of
the
keeper
was
found
although
at
a
subsequent
period
rumors
circulated
that
he
had
been
heard
of
in
america
but
the
man
having
been
unmarried
he
gradually
dropped
out
of
remembrance
and
as
my
grandfather
never
allowed
the
subject
to
be
mentioned
in
his
presence
i
should
probably
never
have
known
anything
about
it
but
for
the
vague
tradition
which
always
attaches
to
such
events
and
for
this
fact
that
after
my
grandfatherâ€™s
death
a
letter
came
addressed
to
him
from
somewhere
in
the
united
states
from
some
one--the
name
different
from
that
of
the
keeper--but
alluding
to
the
past
and
implying
the
presence
of
a
common
secret
and
of
course
with
it
came
a
request
for
money
i
replied
mentioning
the
death
of
sir
richard
and
asking
for
an
explanation
i
did
get
an
answer
and
it
is
from
that
that
i
am
able
to
fill
in
so
much
of
the
story
but
i
never
learned
where
the
man
had
been
killed
and
buried
and
my
next
letter
to
the
fellow
was
returned
with
â€˜deceasedâ€™
written
across
it
somehow
it
never
occurred
to
me
till
i
heard
your
story
that
possibly
the
skeleton
in
the
chalk-pit
might
be
that
of
the
poaching
tinker
i
will
now
most
assuredly
have
it
buried
in
the
churchyardâ€
â€œthat
certainly
ought
to
be
doneâ€
said
i
â€œandâ€
said
sir
francis
after
a
pause
â€œi
give
you
my
word--after
the
burial
of
the
bones
and
you
are
gone
i
will
sleep
for
a
week
in
the
bed
in
the
gallery
and
report
to
you
if
i
see
or
hear
anything
if
all
be
quiet
then--well
you
form
your
own
conclusionsâ€
i
left
a
day
after
before
long
i
got
a
letter
from
my
friend
brief
but
to
the
point
â€œall
quiet
old
boy
come
againâ€
the
ghost
of
the
count
not
far
from
the
alameda
in
the
city
of
mexico
there
is
a
great
old
stone
building
in
which
once
lived
a
very
wealthy
and
wicked
spanish
count
the
house
has
about
four
floors
and
ninety
rooms
more
or
less
the
entire
fourth
floor
is
rented
and
occupied
by
a
big
american
firm
and
their
bookkeeper
an
american
girl
has
given
us
the
following
true
account
of
the
ghost
that
for
years
haunted
the
building
the
second
floor
is
unoccupied
as
no
one
cares
to
live
there
for
obvious
reasons
and
the
bottom
floor
is
also
unoccupied
save
for
lumber
rooms
empty
boxes
and
crates
and
barrels
and
last
of
all
is
the
great
patio
with
its
tiled
floor
where
secretly
in
the
night
a
duel
was
fought
to
the
death
by
the
wicked
count
and
a
famous
austrian
prince
who
was
one
of
maximilianâ€™s
men
the
count
was
killed
no
one
knows
why
the
duel
was
fought
some
say
it
was
because
of
a
beautiful
spanish
woman
some
say
that
it
was
because
of
treasure
that
the
two
jointly
â€œconveyedâ€
and
which
the
count
refused
to
divide
with
his
princely
â€œsocioâ€
and
more
people--mexicans--shrug
their
shoulders
if
you
ask
about
it
and
say
â€œquien
sabeâ€
â€œi
saw
a
ghost
here
last
night
miss
jamesâ€
announces
our
cashier
with
much
eclat
and
evident
pride
so
great
is
the
shock
that
i
gasp
and
my
pen
drops
spattering
red
ink
on
my
nice
fresh
cuffs
and
worse
luck
on
the
ledger
page
that
i
had
just
totted
up
it
is
ruined
and
i
will
have
to
erase
it
or--something
wretched
man
â€œi
wish
to
goodness
it
had
taken
you
offâ€
i
cry
wrathfully
as
i
look
at
the
bespattered
work
â€œnow
will
you
just
look
here
and
see
what
you
have
done
i
wish
you
and
your
ghosts
were
in----â€
â€œgehennaâ€
he
inquires
sweetly
â€œiâ€™ll
fix
that--it
wonâ€™t
take
half
a
minute
and
donâ€™t
look
so
stern
else
i
wonâ€™t
tell
you
about
the
â€˜espantoâ€™
and
you
will
be
sorry
if
you
donâ€™t
hear
about
it--it
would
make
such
a
good
storyâ€
insinuatingly
â€œthen
go
ahead
with
itâ€
ungraciously
â€œwell
last
night
i
was
waiting
for
west
he
was
to
meet
me
here
after
which
it
was
our
intention
to
hit
the--that
is
i
mean
we
were
going
out
together
i
nod
scornfully
and
it
seems
that
while
i
was
patiently
waiting
here
in
my
usual
sweet-tempered
way
the
blank
idiot
had
his
supper
and
then
lay
down
to
rest
himself
for
a
while
you
know
how
delicate
he
is
another
contemptuous
nod
unfortunately
he
forgot
the
engagement
and
slept
on
he
says
he
never
awoke
until
three
oâ€™clock
and
so
didnâ€™t
come
thinking
i
wouldnâ€™t
be
there
meantime
i
also
went
to
sleep
and
might
have
snoozed
on
until
three
likewise
but
for
the
fact
that
the
ghost
woke
me----â€
â€œwell
do
go
onâ€
i
urge
â€œthe
ghost
woke
me
as
i
saidâ€
proceeds
the
simpleton
slowly
â€œit
was
passing
its
cold
fingers
over
my
face
and
groaning
really
it
was
most
extraordinary
at
first
i
didnâ€™t
know
what
it
was
then
as
i
felt
the
icy
fingers
stroking
my
face
and
heard
blood-curdling
groans
issuing
from
the
darkness
i
knew
what
it
was
and
i
remembered
the
story
of
the
prince
and
his
little
duel
down
in
the
patio
and
knew
it
was
the
ghost
of
the
princeâ€™s
victim
by
the
way
you
donâ€™t
know
what
a
funny
sensation
it
is
to
have
a
ghost
pat
your
face
miss
james----â€
â€œpat
nothingâ€
i
retort
indignantly
â€œi
wonder
you
are
not
ashamed
to
tell
me
such
fibs
such
a
ta-ra-diddle
and
as
for
the
man
that
the
prince
killed
downstairs
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
he
was
taken
home
to
spain
and
buried
there
why
then
should
he
come
back
here
into
our
offices
and
pat
your
faceâ€
â€œah
that
i
canâ€™t
sayâ€
with
a
supercilious
drawl
â€œi
can
only
account
for
it
by
thinking
that
the
ghost
has
good
taste--better
than
that
of
some
people
i
knowâ€
meaningly
â€œbut
honestly
i
swear
that
i
am
telling
you
the
truth--cross
my
heart
and
hope
to
die
if
i
am
not
and
you
donâ€™t
know
how
brave
i
was--i
never
screamed
in
fact
i
never
made
a
sound
oh
i
was
braveâ€
â€œthen
what
did
you
doâ€
sternly
â€œi
ran
por
dios
how
i
ran
you
remember
with
what
alacrity
we
got
down
the
stairs
during
the
november
earthquake
i
remember
only
too
distinctly
well
last
nightâ€™s
run
wasnâ€™t
a
run
in
comparison--it
was
a
disappearance
a
flight
a
sprint
i
went
down
the
four
flights
of
stairs
like
a
streak
of
blue
lightning
and
the
ghost
flew
with
me
i
heard
the
pattering
of
its
steps
and
its
groans
clean
down
to
the
patio
door
and
i
assure
you
i
quite
thought
i
had
made
such
an
impression
that
it
was
actually
going
on
home
with
me
and
the
thought
made
me
feel
so
weak
that
i
felt
perforce
obliged
to
take
a--have
a--that
is
strengthen
myself
with
a
cocktail
after
which
i
felt
stronger
and
went
home
quite
peacefully
but
it
was
an
uncanny
experience
wasnâ€™t
itâ€
â€œwas
it
before
or
after
taking
that
cocktailâ€
i
ask
incredulously
â€œand
did
you
take
one
only
or
elevenâ€
i
am
hard
on
the
man
but
he
really
deserves
it
ghosts
spirits
perhaps
but
not
ghosts
whereat
his
feelings
are
quite
â€œhurtedâ€--so
much
so
that
he
vows
he
will
never
tell
me
anything
again
i
had
better
read
about
doubting
thomas
he
never
has
seen
such
an
unbelieving
woman
in
all
his
life
and
if
i
were
only
a
man
he
would
be
tempted
to
pray
that
i
might
see
the
ghost
it
would
serve
me
right
then
wrathfully
departs
to
notice
me
no
more
that
day
not
believing
the
least
bit
in
ghosts
i
gave
the
matter
no
more
thought
in
fact
when
you
fall
heir
to
a
set
of
books
that
havenâ€™t
been
posted
for
nineteen
days
and
you
have
to
do
it
all
and
get
up
your
trial
balance
too
or
else
give
up
your
christmas
holidays
you
havenâ€™t
much
time
to
think
about
ghosts
or
anything
else
except
entries
and
though
i
had
been
working
fourteen
hours
per
day
the
24th
of
december
noon
hour
found
me
with
a
difference
of
1389
the
which
i
of
course
must
locate
and
straighten
out
before
departing
next
morning
on
my
weekâ€™s
holiday
por
supuesto
it
meant
night
work
nothing
else
would
do
and
besides
our
plans
had
all
been
made
to
leave
on
the
eight
oâ€™clock
train
next
morning
so
i
would
just
sit
up
all
night
if
need
be
and
find
the
wretched
balance
and
be
done
with
it
behold
me
settled
for
work
that
night
at
seven
oâ€™clock
in
my
own
office
with
three
lamps
burning
to
keep
it
from
looking
dismal
and
lonely
and
books
and
ledgers
and
journals
piled
up
two
feet
high
around
me
if
hard
work
would
locate
that
nasty
hateful
1389
it
would
surely
be
found
i
had
told
the
portero
downstairs
on
the
ground
floor
to
try
and
keep
awake
for
a
time
but
if
i
didnâ€™t
soon
finish
the
work
i
would
come
down
and
call
him
when
i
was
ready
to
go
home
he
lived
in
a
little
room
all
shut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
building
so
that
it
was
rather
difficult
to
get
at
him
besides
he
was
the
very
laziest
and
sleepiest
peon
possible
and
though
he
was
supposed
to
take
care
of
the
big
building
at
night
patrolling
it
so
as
to
keep
off
ladrones
he
in
reality
slept
so
soundly
that
the
last
trumpet
much
less
mexican
robbers
would
not
have
roused
him
and
for
this
very
reason
before
settling
to
my
work
i
was
careful
to
go
around
and
look
to
locks
and
bolts
myself
everything
was
secure
and
the
doors
safely
fastened
so
that
if
ladrones
did
break
through
they
would
have
to
be
in
shape
to
pass
through
keyholes
or
possess
false
keys
with
never
a
thought
of
spirits
or
porteros
or
anything
else
beyond
the
thirteen
dollars
and
eighty-nine
cents
i
worked
and
added
and
re-added
and
footed
up
and
at
eleven
oâ€™clock
grazia
a
dios
i
had
the
thirteen
dollars
all
safe
and
would
have
whooped
for
joy
had
i
the
time
however
i
wasnâ€™t
out
of
the
woods
yet
the
sum
of
eighty-nine
dollars
being
often
more
easy
of
location
than
eighty-nine
cents
the
latter
must
be
found
also
before
i
could
have
the
pleasure
of
shouting
in
celebration
thereof
at
it
i
went
again
after
brain
cudgeling
and
more
adding
and
prayerful
thought
i
at
last
had
under
my
thumb
that
abominable
eighty
cents
eureka
only
nine
cents
out
i
could
get
it
all
straight
and
have
some
sleep
after
all
inspired
by
which
thought
i
smothered
my
yawns
and
again
began
to
add
i
looked
at
my
watch--ten
minutes
to
twelve
perhaps
i
could
get
it
fixed
before
one
i
suppose
i
had
worked
at
the
nine
cents
for
about
twenty
minutes
one
of
the
cash
entries
looked
to
me
to
be
in
error
i
compared
it
with
the
voucher--yes
that
was
just
where
the
trouble
lay
eleven
cents--ten--nine----
s-t-t
out
went
the
lights
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye--as
i
sat
gaping
in
my
astonishment
from
out
of
the
pitchy
darkness
of
the
room
came
the
most
dreary
horrible
blood-curdling
groan
imaginable
as
i
sat
paralyzed
not
daring
to
breathe
doubting
my
senses
for
a
moment
and
then
thinking
indignantly
that
it
was
some
trick
of
that
wretched
cashier
i
felt
long
thin
icy
fingers
passing
gently
over
my
face
malgame
dios
what
a
sensation
at
first
i
was
afraid
to
move
then
i
nervously
tried
to
brush
the
icy
bony
things
away
as
fast
as
i
brushed
with
my
heart
beating
like
a
steam-hammer
and
gasping
with
deadly
fear
the
fingers
would
come
back
again
a
cold
wind
was
blowing
over
me
again
came
that
dreadful
groan
and
too
frightened
to
move
or
scream
i
tumbled
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
among
the
books
and
ledgers
then
i
suppose
i
fainted
when
i
regained
my
senses
i
was
still
in
a
heap
with
the
ledgers
still
it
was
dark
and
still
i
felt
the
cold
fingers
caressing
my
face
at
which
i
became
thoroughly
desperate
no
ghost
should
own
me
i
had
laughed
at
the
poor
cashier
and
hinted
darkly
at
cocktails
pray
what
better
was
i
i
scrambled
to
my
feet
the
fingers
still
stroking
my
face
i
must
address
them--what
language--did
they
understand
english
or
spanish
i
wondered
spanish
would
doubtless
be
most
suitable
if
indeed
it
was
the
ghost
of
the
murdered
count----
â€œwill
you
do
me
the
favor
senor
ghostâ€
i
started
out
bravely
in
my
best
spanish
but
with
a
very
trembling
voice
â€œto
inform
me
what
it
is
that
you
desire
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
because
if
not
i
would
like
very
much
to
be
allowed
to
finish
my
work
which
i
cannot
do
if
you
will
pardon
my
abruptness
if
i
am
not
aloneâ€
being
the
ghost
of
a
gentleman
and
a
diplomat
surely
he
would
take
the
hint
and
vanish
ojala
perhaps
the
ghost
did
not
understand
my
spanish
at
any
rate
there
was
no
articulate
reply
there
was
another
groan--again
the
fingers
touched
me
and
then
there
was
such
a
mournful
sigh
that
i
felt
sorry
for
the
poor
thing--what
could
be
the
matter
with
it
with
my
pity
all
fear
was
lost
for
a
moment
and
i
said
to
the
darkness
all
about
me
â€œwhat
is
it
that
you
wish
pobre
senor
can
i
not
aid
you
i
am
not
afraid--let
me
help
youâ€
the
fingers
moved
uncertainly
for
a
moment
then
the
ledgers
all
fell
down
with
a
loud
bang
a
cold
hand
caught
mine
very
gently--i
tried
not
to
feel
frightened
but
it
was
difficult--and
i
was
led
off
blindly
through
the
offices
i
could
not
see
a
thing--not
a
glimmer
of
light
showed
not
a
sound
was
heard
except
my
own
footsteps
and
the
faint
sound
of
the
invisible
something
that
was
leading
me
along--there
were
no
more
groans
thank
goodness
else
i
should
have
shrieked
and
fainted
without
a
doubt
only
the
pattering
footsteps
and
the
cold
hand
that
led
me
on
and
on
we--the
fingers
and
i--were
somehow
in
the
great
hall
then
on
the
second
floor
and
at
last
on
the
stairs
going
on
down
flight
after
flight
then
i
knew
that
i
was
being
led
about
by
the
fingers
on
the
tiled
floor
of
the
patio
and
close
to
the
porteroâ€™s
lodge
simpleton
that
he
was
sleeping
like
a
log
no
doubt
while
i
was
being
led
about
in
the
black
darkness
by
an
invisible
hand
and
no
one
to
save
me
i
would
have
yelled
of
course
but
for
one
fact--i
found
it
utterly
impossible
to
speak
or
move
my
tongue
being
a
rare
and
uncomfortable
sensation
but
where
were
we
going
back
into
the
unused
lumber
rooms
joining
onto
the
patio
nothing
there
except
barrels
and
slabs
and
empty
boxes
what
could
the
ghost
mean
he
must
be
utterly
demented
surely
in
the
middle
of
the
first
room
we
paused
i
had
an
idea
of
rushing
out
and
screaming
for
the
portero
but
abandoned
it
when
i
found
that
my
feet
wouldnâ€™t
go
i
heard
steps
passing
to
and
fro
about
the
floor
and
waited
cold
and
trembling
they
approached
me
again
my
hand
was
taken
and
i
was
led
over
near
the
corner
of
the
room
obedient
to
the
unseen
will
i
bent
down
and
groped
about
the
floor
guided
by
the
cold
fingers
holding
mine
until
i
felt
something
like
a
tiny
ring
set
firmly
in
the
floor
i
pulled
at
it
faintly
but
it
did
not
move
at
which
the
ghost
gave
a
faint
sigh
for
a
second
the
cold
fingers
pressed
mine
quite
affectionately
then
released
me
and
i
heard
steps
passing
slowly
into
the
patio
then
dying
away
where
was
it
going
and
what
on
earth
did
it
all
mean
but
i
was
so
tired
and
wrought
up
i
tried
to
find
the
door
but
couldnâ€™t
the
cashier
would
have
been
revenged
could
he
have
seen
me
stupidly
fumbling
at
a
barrel
thinking
it
was
the
door
and
at
last
too
fatigued
and
sleepy
to
stand
i
dropped
down
on
the
cold
stone
floor
and
went
to
sleep
i
must
have
slept
for
some
hours
for
when
i
awoke
the
light
of
dawn
was
coming
in
at
the
window
and
i
sat
up
and
wondered
if
i
had
taken
leave
of
my
senses
during
the
night
what
on
earth
could
i
be
doing
here
in
the
lumber-room
then
like
a
flash
i
remembered
and
half
unconsciously
crept
about
on
the
floor
seeking
the
small
ring
there
it
was
i
caught
it
and
jerked
at
it
hard
hey
presto
change
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
entire
floor
was
giving
way
there
was
a
sliding
crashing
sound
and
i
found
myself
hanging
on
for
dear
life
to
a
barrel
that
fortunately
retained
its
equilibrium
and
with
my
feet
dangling
into
space
down
below
me
was
a
small
stone-floored
room
with
big
boxes
and
small
ones
ranged
about
the
walls
treasure
like
a
flash
the
thought
struck
me
and
with
one
leap
i
was
down
in
the
secret
room
gazing
about
at
the
boxes
but
alas
upon
investigation
the
biggest
chests
proved
empty
the
bad
wicked
count
no
wonder
he
couldnâ€™t
rest
in
his
spanish
grave
but
must
come
back
to
the
scene
of
his
wickedness
and
deceit
to
make
reparation
but
the
smaller
chests
were
literally
crammed
with
all
sorts
of
things--big
heavy
spanish
coins
in
gold
and
silver--gold
and
silver
dinner
services
with
the
crest
of
the
unfortunate
emperor
magnificent
pieces
of
jeweled
armor
and
weapons
beautiful
jewelry
and
loose
precious
stones
i
deliberately
selected
handfuls
of
the
latter
giving
my
preference
to
the
diamonds
and
pearls--i
had
always
had
a
taste
for
them
which
i
had
never
before
been
able
to
gratify--and
packed
them
in
a
wooden
box
that
i
found
in
the
lumber-room
the
gold
and
dinner
services
and
armor
etc
i
left
as
they
were
being
rather
cumbersome
and
carried
off
rejoicing
my
big
box
of
diamonds
and
pearls
and
other
jewelry
needless
to
say
we
didnâ€™t
go
away
for
the
holidays
on
the
eight
oâ€™clock
train
but
i
did
come
down
to
the
office
and
proceeded
to
locate
my
missing
nine
cents
after
which
i
unfolded
the
tale
of
the
ghost
and
the
treasure--only
keeping
quiet
the
matter
of
my
private
loot
of
which
i
was
heartily
glad
afterwards
for
when
the
government
learned
of
the
find
what
do
you
suppose
they
offered
me
for
going
about
with
the
ghost
and
discovering
the
secret
room
and
treasure
ten
thousand
dollars
when
i
refused
stating
that
i
would
take
merely
as
my
reward
one
of
the
gold
dinner
services
the
greedy
things
objected
at
first
but
i
finally
had
my
way
and
to
this
very
day
they
have
no
idea
that
i--even
i--have
all
the
beautiful
jewels
wouldnâ€™t
they
be
furious
if
they
knew
it
but
they
arenâ€™t
apt
to
unless
they
learn
english
and
read
this
story
which
isnâ€™t
likely
the
old
mansion
down
on
long
beach
that
narrow
strip
of
sand
which
stretches
along
the
new
jersey
coast
from
barnegat
inlet
on
the
north
to
little
egg
harbor
inlet
on
the
south
the
summer
sojourner
at
some
one
of
the
numerous
resorts
which
of
late
years
have
sprung
up
every
few
miles
may
in
wandering
over
the
sand
dunes
just
across
the
bay
from
the
village
of
manahawkin
stumble
over
some
charred
timbers
or
vestiges
of
crumbling
chimneys
showing
that
once
years
back
a
human
habitation
has
stood
there
if
the
find
rouses
the
jaded
curiosity
of
the
visitor
sufficiently
to
impel
him
to
question
the
weatherbeaten
old
bayman
who
sails
him
on
his
fishing
trips
he
will
learn
that
these
relics
mark
the
site
of
one
of
the
first
summer
hotels
erected
on
the
new
jersey
coast
â€œthatâ€™s
where
the
old
mansion
stoodâ€
he
will
be
informed
by
captain
nate
or
captain
sam
or
whatever
particular
captain
it
may
chance
to
be
and
if
by
good
fortune
it
chances
to
be
captain
jim
he
will
hear
a
story
that
will
pleasantly
pass
away
the
long
wait
for
a
sheepshead
bite
it
was
my
good
luck
to
have
secured
captain
jim
for
a
preceptor
in
the
anglerâ€™s
art
during
my
vacation
last
summer
and
his
stories
and
reminiscences
of
long
beach
were
not
the
least
enjoyable
features
of
the
two
weeksâ€™
sojourn
captain
jim
was
not
garrulous
few
of
the
baymen
are
they
are
a
sturdy
self-reliant
and
self-controlled
people
full
of
strong
common
sense
but
still
with
that
firm
belief
in
the
supernatural
which
seems
inherent
in
dwellers
by
the
sea
â€œthe
old
mansionâ€
said
captain
jim
â€œor
the
mansion
of
health
for
that
was
its
full
name
was
built
away
back
in
1822
so
iâ€™ve
heard
my
father
say
there
had
been
a
tavern
close
by
years
before
that
was
kept
by
a
man
named
cranmer
and
people
used
to
come
from
philadelphia
by
stage
sixty
miles
through
the
pines
to
â€˜hawkin
and
then
cross
here
by
boat
some
would
stop
at
cranmerâ€™s
and
others
went
on
down
the
beach
to
homerâ€™s
which
was
clear
down
at
end
by
the
inlet
finally
some
of
the
wealthy
people
concluded
that
they
wanted
better
accommodations
than
cranmer
gave
so
they
formed
the
great
swamp
long
beach
company
and
built
the
mansion
of
health
iâ€™ve
heard
that
when
it
was
built
it
was
the
biggest
hotel
on
the
coast
and
was
considered
a
wonder
it
was
120
feet
long
three
stories
high
and
had
a
porch
running
all
the
way
around
it
with
a
balcony
on
top
it
was
certainly
a
big
thing
for
those
days
iâ€™ve
heard
father
tell
many
a
time
of
the
stage
loads
of
gay
people
that
used
to
come
rattling
into
â€˜hawkin
each
stage
drawn
by
four
horses
and
sometimes
four
or
five
of
them
a
day
in
the
summer
a
good
many
people
too
used
to
come
in
their
own
carriages
and
leave
them
over
on
the
mainland
until
they
were
ready
to
go
home
there
were
gay
times
at
the
old
mansion
then
and
it
made
times
good
for
the
people
along
shore
tooâ€
â€œhow
long
did
the
old
mansion
flourish
captainâ€
i
asked
â€œwell
for
twenty-five
or
thirty
years
people
came
there
summer
after
summer
then
they
built
a
railroad
to
cape
may
and
that
with
the
ghosts
settled
the
mansion
of
healthâ€
â€œwhat
do
you
mean
by
the
ghostsâ€
i
demanded
â€œwell
you
seeâ€
said
captain
jim
cutting
off
a
mouthful
of
navy
plug
â€œthe
story
got
around
that
the
old
house
was
haunted
some
people
said
there
were
queer
things
seen
there
and
strange
noises
were
heard
that
nobody
could
account
for
and
pretty
soon
the
place
got
a
bad
name
and
visitors
were
so
few
that
it
didnâ€™t
pay
to
keep
it
open
any
moreâ€
â€œbut
how
did
it
get
the
name
of
being
haunted
captain
jimâ€
i
persisted
â€œwhy
it
was
this
wayâ€
continued
the
mariner
â€œmaybe
youâ€™ve
heard
of
the
time
early
in
the
fifties
when
the
powhatan
was
wrecked
on
the
beach
here
and
every
soul
on
board
was
lost
she
was
an
emigrant
ship
and
there
were
over
400
people
aboard--passengers
and
crew
she
came
ashore
here
during
the
equinoctial
storm
in
september
there
wasnâ€™t
any
life-saving
stations
in
them
days
and
everyone
was
drowned
you
can
see
the
long
graves
now
over
in
the
â€˜hawkin
churchyard
where
the
bodies
were
buried
after
they
came
ashore
they
put
them
in
three
long
trenches
that
were
dug
from
one
end
of
the
burying-ground
to
the
other
the
only
people
on
the
beach
that
night
was
the
man
who
took
care
of
the
old
mansion
he
lived
there
with
his
family
and
his
son-in-law
lived
with
him
he
was
the
wreckmaster
for
this
part
of
the
coast
too
it
wasnâ€™t
till
the
second
day
that
the
people
from
â€˜hawkin
could
get
over
to
the
beach
and
by
that
time
the
bodies
had
all
come
ashore
and
the
wreckmaster
had
them
all
piled
up
on
the
sand
i
was
a
youngster
then
and
came
over
with
my
father
and
i
tell
you
it
was
the
awfullest
sight
i
ever
saw--them
long
rows
of
drowned
people
all
lying
there
with
their
white
still
faces
turned
up
to
the
sky
some
were
women
with
their
dead
babies
clasped
tight
in
their
arms
and
some
were
husbands
and
wives
whose
bodies
came
ashore
locked
together
in
a
death
embrace
iâ€™ll
never
forget
that
sight
as
long
as
i
live
well
when
the
coroner
came
and
took
charge
he
began
to
inquire
whether
any
money
or
valuables
had
been
found
but
the
wreckmaster
declared
that
not
a
solitary
coin
had
been
washed
ashore
people
thought
this
was
rather
singular
as
the
emigrants
were
most
of
them
well-to-do
germans
and
were
known
to
have
brought
a
good
deal
of
money
with
them
but
it
was
concluded
that
it
had
gone
down
with
the
ship
well
the
poor
emigrants
were
given
pauper
burial
and
the
people
had
begun
to
forget
their
suspicions
until
three
or
four
months
later
there
came
another
storm
and
the
sea
broke
clear
over
the
beach
just
below
the
old
mansion
and
washed
away
the
sand
next
morning
early
two
men
from
â€˜hawkin
sailed
across
the
bay
and
landed
on
the
beach
they
walked
across
on
the
hard
bottom
where
the
sea
had
washed
across
and
when
about
half
way
from
the
bay
one
of
the
men
saw
something
curious
close
up
against
the
stump
of
an
old
cedar
tree
he
called
the
other
manâ€™s
attention
to
it
and
they
went
over
to
the
stump
what
they
found
was
a
pile
of
leather
money-belts
that
would
have
filled
a
wheelbarrow
every
one
was
cut
open
and
empty
they
had
been
buried
in
the
sand
close
by
the
old
stump
and
the
sea
had
washed
away
the
covering
the
men
didnâ€™t
go
any
further
â€œthey
carried
the
belts
to
their
boats
and
sailed
back
to
â€˜hawkin
as
fast
as
the
wind
would
take
them
of
course
it
made
a
big
sensation
and
everybody
was
satisfied
that
the
wreckmaster
had
robbed
the
bodies
if
he
hadnâ€™t
done
anything
worse
but
there
was
no
way
to
prove
it
and
so
nothing
was
done
the
wreckmaster
didnâ€™t
stay
around
here
long
after
that
though
the
people
made
it
too
hot
for
him
and
he
and
his
family
went
away
south
where
it
was
said
he
bought
a
big
plantation
and
a
lot
of
slaves
years
afterward
the
story
came
to
â€˜hawkin
somehow
that
he
was
killed
in
a
barroom
brawl
and
that
his
son-in-law
was
drowned
by
his
boat
upsettinâ€™
while
he
was
out
fishinâ€™
i
donâ€™t
furnish
any
affidavits
with
that
part
of
the
story
though
â€œhowever
after
that
nobody
lived
in
the
old
mansion
for
long
at
a
time
people
would
go
there
stay
a
week
or
two
and
leave--and
at
last
it
was
given
up
entirely
to
beach
parties
in
the
day
time
and
ghosts
at
nightâ€
â€œbut
captain
you
donâ€™t
really
believe
the
ghost
part
do
youâ€
i
asked
captain
jim
looked
down
the
bay
expectorated
gravely
over
the
side
of
the
boat
and
answered
slowly
â€œwell
i
donâ€™t
know
as
i
would
have
believed
in
â€™em
if
i
hadnâ€™t
seen
the
ghostâ€
â€œwhatâ€
i
exclaimed
â€œyou
saw
it
tell
me
about
it
iâ€™ve
always
wanted
to
see
a
ghost
or
next
best
thing
a
man
who
has
seen
oneâ€
â€œit
was
one
august
about
1861â€
said
the
captain
â€œi
was
a
young
feller
then
and
with
a
half
dozen
more
was
over
on
the
beach
cutting
salt
hay
we
didnâ€™t
go
home
at
nights
but
did
our
own
cooking
in
the
old
mansion
kitchen
and
at
nights
slept
on
piles
of
hay
upstairs
we
were
a
reckless
lot
of
scamps
and
reckoned
that
no
ghosts
could
scare
us
there
was
a
big
full
moon
that
night
and
it
was
as
light
as
day
the
muskeeters
was
pretty
bad
too
and
it
was
easier
to
stay
awake
than
go
to
sleep
along
toward
midnight
me
and
two
other
fellers
went
out
on
the
old
balcony
and
began
to
race
around
the
house
we
hollered
and
yelled
and
chased
each
other
for
half
an
hour
or
so
and
then
we
concluded
we
had
better
go
to
sleep
so
we
started
for
the
window
of
the
room
where
the
rest
were
this
window
was
near
one
end
on
the
ocean
side
and
as
i
came
around
the
corner
i
stopped
as
if
i
had
been
shot
and
my
hair
raised
straight
up
on
top
of
my
head
right
there
in
front
of
that
window
stood
a
woman
looking
out
over
the
sea
and
in
her
arms
she
held
a
little
child
i
saw
her
as
plain
as
i
see
you
now
it
seemed
to
me
like
an
hour
she
stood
there
but
i
donâ€™t
suppose
it
was
a
second
then
she
was
gone
when
i
could
move
i
looked
around
for
the
other
boys
and
they
were
standing
there
paralyzed
they
had
seen
the
woman
too
we
didnâ€™t
say
much
and
we
didnâ€™t
sleep
much
that
night
and
the
next
night
we
bunked
out
on
the
beach
the
rest
of
the
crowd
made
all
manner
of
fun
of
us
but
we
had
had
all
the
ghost
we
wanted
and
i
never
set
foot
inside
the
old
house
after
thatâ€
â€œwhen
did
it
burn
down
captainâ€
i
asked
as
jim
relapsed
into
silence
â€œsomewhere
about
twenty-five
years
ago
a
beach
party
had
been
roasting
clams
in
the
old
oven
and
in
some
way
the
fire
got
to
the
woodwork
it
was
as
dry
as
tinder
and
i
hope
the
ghosts
were
all
burnt
up
with
itâ€
a
misfit
ghost
every
boy
with
a
knowledge
of
adventurous
literature
otherwise
â€œnovels
of
actionâ€
knows
of
the
â€œphantom
shipâ€
the
spook
of
the
high
seas
but
it
has
not
been
known
that
ships
themselves
are
haunted
and
that
in
the
service
of
the
united
states
coast
survey
there
is
a
vessel
now
in
commission
that
is
by
her
own
officers
supposed
to
be
haunted
yet
the
eagre
a
140-foot
schooner
of
the
coast
survey
is
looked
upon
in
the
service
as
a
very
undesirable
vessel
to
be
aboard
of
about
her
there
is
an
atmosphere
of
gloom
that
wardroom
jest
cannot
dispel
duty
on
board
her
has
been
shunned
as
would
be
a
pestilence
and
stories
have
been
told
by
officers
who
have
cruised
aboard
her
that
are
not
good
for
timid
people
to
hear
officers
have
hesitated
about
telling
these
uncanny
stories
but
they
have
become
sufficiently
well
known
to
make
a
billet
to
duty
aboard
the
eagre
unwelcome
among
the
coast
survey
men
the
mohawk
was
launched
june
10
1875
at
greenpoint
and
she
was
then
the
largest
sailing
yacht
afloat
william
t
garner
her
young
millionaire
owner
was
very
proud
of
his
new
craft
and
all
the
then
leaders
of
new
york
society
were
invited
to
participate
in
the
good
time
afloat
with
which
her
launching
was
celebrated
commodore
garner
then
but
thirty-three
years
old
and
his
young
wife
entertained
charmingly
and
the
trim
speedy
mohawk
was
christened
with
unusually
merry
festivities
soon
after
that
she
was
capsized
by
a
sudden
squall
off
the
landing
at
stapleton
n
y
and
six
people
were
drowned
like
rats
in
her
cabin
and
forecastle
then
the
mohawk
was
raised
at
a
cost
of
25000
and
purchased
by
the
united
states
government
for
the
service
of
the
coast
survey
her
name
was
changed
to
eagre
for
jack
tar
is
proverbially
superstitious
and
with
the
old
name
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
ship
a
crew
lieutenant
higby
king
describes
his
initial
experience
when
he
was
assigned
to
duty
on
the
eagre
in
this
way
â€œshe
had
her
full
complement
of
officers
minus
one
when
i
boarded
her
at
newport
to
complete
the
list
every
cabin
was
occupied
but
the
port
cabin
by
the
companion
way
and
to
that
i
was
assigned
â€œwe
had
a
jolly
wardroom
mess
that
night
and
i
retired
from
it
early
as
i
was
tired
by
my
journey
to
join
the
vessel
the
others
who
were
still
at
the
table
regarded
my
retirement
to
the
port
cabin
in
absolute
silence
having
bidden
me
good-night
their
silence
did
not
lead
me
to
suspect
anything
though
i
knew
that
the
eagre
had
once
been
the
mohawk
my
cabin
door
had
the
usual
cabin
lock
of
brass
and
the
porthole
was
also
securely
fastened
there
could
have
been
no
one
under
the
bed
or
sofa
as
beneath
each
was
a
facing
of
solid
oak
paneling
â€œi
undressed
lazily
and
left
the
light
burning
dimly
in
my
bracket
lamp
i
tried
conscientiously
to
go
to
sleep
for
i
donâ€™t
know
how
long
with
my
back
turned
to
the
light
the
noise
ceased
in
the
wardroom
after
a
time
and
i
knew
the
others
had
turned
in
but
i
felt
unaccountably
nervous
and
restless
i
turned
over
and
faced
the
light
thoroughly
wide
awake
and
there
in
the
single
chair
sat
an
elderly
man
seemingly
wrapt
in
deep
thought
he
was
dressed
in
a
blue
yachting
reefer
and
had
a
long
gray
beard
his
hands
were
clasped
in
his
lap
and
his
eyes
were
downcast
his
face
was
not
pale
and
ghastly
as
the
faces
of
ghosts
are
popularly
supposed
to
be
but
ruddy
and
weatherbeaten
â€œi
regarded
him
in
scared
silence
for
i
donâ€™t
know
how
long
though
it
seemed
an
hour
when
he
or
it
or
whatever
it
was
disappeared
during
that
time
the
ghost
and
such
i
now
believe
it
to
have
been
made
not
a
motion
nor
did
it
say
anything
presently
i
looked
again
and
it
was
gone
â€œat
breakfast
the
others
watched
me
critically
as
i
took
my
seat
i
had
not
intended
to
say
anything
about
my
experience
for
i
thought
then
i
had
seen
some
sort
of
hallucination
and
strongly
suspected
that
i
was
verging
on
insanity
lieutenant
irving
asked
me
if
i
had
slept
well
i
replied
that
i
had
â€˜didnâ€™t
you
see
anythingâ€™
he
inquired
i
then
frankly
admitted
that
i
had
and
described
my
experience
then
i
learned
that
each
one
of
the
seven
others
present
had
tried
the
port
cabin
at
one
time
or
another
and
each
had
seen
the
self-same
apparition
it
had
acted
in
exactly
the
same
way
in
each
case
except
in
the
case
of
irving
who
shot
at
it
with
his
pistol
when
it
immediately
disappeared
some
of
the
others
had
been
led
by
their
curiosity
to
inquire
if
anyone
lost
on
the
mohawk
resembled
the
figure
and
found
that
none
of
the
unfortunate
ones
at
all
fitted
the
description
it
had
been
dubbed
by
them
the
â€˜misfit
ghostâ€™
that
one
experience
was
enough
for
me
and
after
that
i
by
courtesy
shared
the
cabin
of
another
fellowâ€
lieutenant
irving
and
others
corroborate
the
story
of
lieutenant
king
and
as
additional
evidence
that
the
eagre
is
haunted
lieutenant
irving
describes
a
new
yearâ€™s
eve
experience
of
the
eagreâ€™s
officers
that
is
to
say
the
least
novel
in
the
way
of
supernatural
manifestations
â€œit
was
at
mess
the
first
toast
â€˜sweethearts
and
wivesâ€™
had
been
drunk
as
it
always
is
by
yankee
sailors
the
world
over
on
occasions
of
festivity
everyone
was
feeling
happy
or
as
thackeray
has
it
â€˜pleasantâ€™
when
suddenly
the
sliding-doors
separating
the
wardroom
from
the
companion
way
closed
slowly
with
a
loud
squeaking
noise
they
had
seldom
been
closed
and
it
took
the
entire
strength
of
a
man
to
start
them
from
their
rusty
fastenings
yet
upon
this
occasion
they
started
easily
and
closed
tightly
while
the
officers
jumped
to
their
feet
in
breathless
astonishment
half
a
dozen
men
hauled
them
open
in
haste
but
not
a
soul
was
behind
them
or
anywhere
about
â€˜it
must
be
our
old
friend
of
the
port
cabinâ€™
suggested
one
and
in
awe-stricken
silence
the
health
of
the
â€˜misfit
ghostâ€™
was
drunkâ€
an
unbidden
guest
my
cousins
kate
and
tom
howard
married
at
trinity
at
easter
time
concluded
to
commence
housekeeping
by
taking
one
of
those
delightfully
expensively
furnished
unfurnished
cottages
with
which
the
fashionable
watering
place
of
w----
abounds
from
whose
rear
windows
one
might
almost
take
a
plunge
into
the
surf
the
beach
beginning
at
the
back
door
they
went
down
quite
early
in
may
being
in
a
great
hurry
to
try
their
domestic
experiment
and
as
the
evenings
were
still
cold
they
spent
them
about
the
open
fire
â€œspooningâ€
it
was
upon
one
of
those
nights
about
eleven
oâ€™clock
that
they
were
startled
by
a
noise
as
of
some
small
object
falling
soon
followed
by
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
and
then
quiet
again
reigned
supreme
at
once
tom
poker
in
hand
boldly
started
in
search
of
the
burglar
followed
by
kate
wildly
clutching
at
his
coat-tail
and
in
a
state
of
tremor
they
looked
upstairs
under
the
various
beds
kate
suggesting
that
in
novels
they
were
always
to
be
found
there
the
dining-room
was
next
explored
where
all
seemed
well
and
lastly
the
kitchen
where
they
found
what
was
evidently
a
solution
of
the
mystery
the
burglar
had
entered
by
the
back
door
which
was
found
to
be
unlocked
and
slightly
ajar
the
first
excitement
subsiding
they
returned
again
to
the
dining-room
where
tom
upon
closer
inspection
then
discovered
that
one
of
a
pair
of
quaint
little
pepper-pots
wedding
gifts
was
missing
and
other
small
articles
on
the
sideboard
had
been
slightly
disturbed
the
next
morning
when
kate
mildly
remonstrated
with
the
queen
of
the
kitchen
for
her
carelessness
she
received
a
shock
by
being
told
that
it
was
her
usual
custom
to
leave
the
door
open
â€œso
that
it
would
be
aisy
convanient
loike
for
the
milkmaidâ€
they
parted
with
her
and
a
new
maid
was
engaged
whose
chief
qualification
for
the
place
was
that
she
was
most
faithful
in
the
discharge
of
her
duties
especially
in
â€œlocking
upâ€
while
they
mourned
the
loss
of
the
pepper-pot
still
it
seemed
so
trifling
when
they
thought
of
that
lovely
repousse
salad
bowl
sent
by
aunt
julia
which
stood
near
by
that
nothing
was
said
of
the
loss
outside
of
the
family
and
the
little
household
settled
into
its
normal
state
once
more
of
â€œbilling
and
cooingâ€
about
a
fortnight
later
tom
started
out
one
night
with
an
old
fisherman
one
of
the
natives
and
a
local
â€œcharacterâ€
to
indulge
in
that
delightful
pastime
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
man
known
as
â€œeelingâ€
and
as
the
night
was
dark
the
eels
were
particularly
â€œsportyâ€
so
that
it
was
well
on
towards
the
â€œwee
smaâ€™
hoursâ€
when
tom
at
last
returned
to
the
cottage
he
found
all
excitement
within
kate
was
in
hysterics
and
the
new
maid
also
weeping
was
industriously
applying
the
camphor
bottle
to
her
mistressâ€™
nose
the
burglar
or
ghost
as
they
had
now
decided
the
windows
and
doors
being
found
to
be
securely
locked
this
time
had
been
abroad
again
but
had
succeeded
in
purloining
nothing
his
royal
ghostship
had
amused
himself
apparently
by
simply
walking
about
â€œoh
tom
he
had
on
such
heavy
boots
and
was
so
dreadfully
bold
about
itâ€
said
kate
tearfully
from
that
time
kate
became
nervous
and
refused
to
be
left
alone
tom
started
whenever
a
door
creaked
and
the
â€œtreasureâ€
departed
hurriedly
saying
â€œfaith
the
house
is
haunted
sureâ€
after
that
kate
spent
her
days
in
â€œgirl
huntingâ€
and
her
nights
in
answering
shadowy
advertisements
that
never
materialized
they
tried
irish
english
dutch
and
a
â€œheathen
chineeâ€
with
a
sprinkling
of
â€œcolored
ladiesâ€
to
vary
the
monotony
they
seemed
about
to
become
famous
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
as
â€œthe
family
that
changes
help
once
a
weekâ€
when
they
landed
treasure
no

shortly
after
her
advent
we
were
all
asked
down
to
w----
to
help
celebrate
their
happiness
and
incidentally
to
christen
the
new
dinner
set
we
were
not
a
little
surprised
at
finding
kate
so
pale
and
tom
rather
distrait
however
after
a
delightful
dinner
that
should
have
filled
with
pleasure
the
most
exacting
bride
we
adjourned
to
the
piazza
leaving
the
men
to
the
contemplation
of
their
cigars
we
were
enthusiastic
in
our
praise
of
the
house
and
congratulated
kate
in
securing
such
a
prize
when
to
our
horror
she
burst
into
tears
and
said
â€œoh
girls
itâ€™s
a
dreadful
place
itâ€™s
hauntedâ€
and
then
tearfully
proceeded
with
the
details
until
we
all
felt
creepy
and
suggested
the
parlor
and
lights
it
was
not
until
long
afterwards
that
kate
discovered
that
tom
had
also
related
the
â€œghost
storyâ€
to
the
men
that
evening
to
which
ned
harris
had
said
laconically
â€œratsâ€
and
bob
shaw
laughingly
remarked
â€œtom
old
chap
you
really
shouldnâ€™t
take
your
nightcap
so
strongâ€
about
the
first
of
july
the
climax
came
the
ghost
walked
again
this
time
taking
not
only
the
remaining
pepper-pot
but
also
a
silver
salt-cellar
evidently
he
had
a
penchant
for
small
articles
but
unlike
former
times
everything
on
the
sideboard
was
in
the
greatest
disorder
aunt
juliaâ€™s
salad
bowl
was
found
on
the
floor
and
not
far
away
the
cheese-dish
with
its
contents
scattered
about
this
time
one
of
the
windows
was
found
half
open
a
week
later
a
note
came
to
me
from
kate
saying
that
she
and
tom
had
gone
to
saratoga
to
spend
the
remainder
of
the
season
with
her
mother
the
following
spring
tom
received
a
note
and
parcel
from
mr
b----
the
owner
of
the
house
at
w----
which
read
as
follows
dear
mr
howard
i
send
you
by
express
three
articles
of
silver
which
my
wife
suggests
may
belong
to
you
as
they
are
marked
with
your
initials
namely
two
silver
pepper-pots
and
a
salt-cellar
they
were
found
the
other
day
during
the
process
of
spring
house
cleaning
in
a
rat
hole
behind
the
sideboard
i
forgot
to
have
the
holes
stopped
up
last
spring
or
to
caution
you
against
the
water
rats
the
great
fellows
will
get
in
you
know
kind
regards
to
mrs
howard
very
truly
john
b----
the
next
season
the
â€œghost
clubâ€
was
organized
the
badge
being
a
small
silver
rat
bearing
proudly
aloft
a
tiny
pepper-pot
we
thoughtfully
offered
tom
the
presidency
but
he
declined
with
offended
dignity
from
the
effects
of
which
i
think
he
will
never
fully
recover
the
dead
womanâ€™s
photograph
virgil
hoyt
is
a
photographerâ€™s
assistant
up
at
st
paul
and
a
man
of
a
good
deal
of
taste
he
has
been
in
search
of
the
picturesque
all
over
the
west
and
hundreds
of
miles
to
the
north
in
canada
and
can
speak
three
or
four
indian
dialects
and
put
a
canoe
through
the
rapids
that
is
to
say
he
is
a
man
of
an
adventurous
sort
and
no
dreamer
he
can
fight
well
and
shoot
well
and
swim
well
enough
to
put
up
a
winning
race
with
the
indian
boys
and
he
can
sit
all
day
in
the
saddle
and
not
dream
about
it
at
night
wherever
he
goes
he
uses
his
camera
â€œthe
worldâ€
hoyt
is
in
the
habit
of
saying
to
those
who
sit
with
him
when
he
smokes
his
pipe
â€œwas
created
in
six
days
to
be
photographed
man--and
especially
woman--was
made
for
the
same
purpose
clouds
are
not
made
to
give
moisture
nor
trees
to
cast
shade
they
were
created
for
the
photographerâ€
in
short
virgil
hoytâ€™s
view
of
the
world
is
whimsical
and
he
doesnâ€™t
like
to
be
bothered
with
anything
disagreeable
that
is
the
reason
that
he
loathes
and
detests
going
to
a
house
of
mourning
to
photograph
a
corpse
the
horribly
bad
taste
of
it
offends
him
partly
and
partly
he
is
annoyed
at
having
to
shoulder
even
for
a
few
moments
a
part
of
someoneâ€™s
burden
of
sorrow
he
doesnâ€™t
like
sorrow
and
would
willingly
canoe
500
miles
up
the
cold
canadian
rivers
to
get
rid
of
it
nevertheless
as
assistant
photographer
it
is
often
his
duty
to
do
this
very
kind
of
thing
not
long
ago
he
was
sent
for
by
a
rich
jewish
family
at
st
paul
to
photograph
the
mother
who
had
just
died
he
was
very
much
put
out
but
he
went
he
was
taken
to
the
front
parlor
where
the
dead
woman
lay
in
her
coffin
it
was
evident
that
there
was
some
excitement
in
the
household
and
that
a
discussion
was
going
on
but
hoyt
wasnâ€™t
concerned
and
so
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
matter
the
daughter
wanted
the
coffin
turned
on
end
in
order
that
the
corpse
might
face
the
camera
properly
but
hoyt
said
he
could
overcome
the
recumbent
attitude
and
make
it
appear
that
the
face
was
taken
in
the
position
it
would
naturally
hold
in
life
and
so
they
went
out
and
left
him
alone
with
the
dead
the
face
was
a
strong
and
positive
one
such
as
may
often
be
seen
among
jewish
matrons
hoyt
regarded
it
with
some
admiration
thinking
to
himself
that
she
was
a
woman
who
had
been
used
to
having
her
own
way
there
was
a
strand
of
hair
out
of
place
and
he
pushed
it
back
from
her
brow
a
bud
lifted
its
head
too
high
from
among
the
roses
on
her
breast
and
spoiled
the
contour
of
the
chin
so
he
broke
it
off
he
remembered
these
things
later
very
distinctly
and
that
his
hand
touched
her
bare
face
two
or
three
times
then
he
took
the
photographs
and
left
the
house
he
was
very
busy
at
the
time
and
several
days
elapsed
before
he
was
able
to
develop
the
plates
he
took
them
from
the
bath
in
which
they
had
lain
with
a
number
of
others
and
went
to
work
upon
them
there
were
three
plates
he
having
taken
that
number
merely
as
a
precaution
against
any
accident
they
came
up
well
but
as
they
developed
he
became
aware
of
the
existence
of
something
in
the
photograph
which
had
not
been
apparent
to
his
eye
the
mysterious
always
came
under
the
head
of
the
disagreeable
with
him
and
was
therefore
to
be
banished
so
he
made
only
a
few
prints
and
put
the
things
away
out
of
sight
he
hoped
that
something
would
intervene
to
save
him
from
attempting
an
explanation
but
it
is
a
part
of
the
general
perplexity
of
life
that
things
do
not
intervene
as
they
ought
and
when
they
ought
so
one
day
his
employer
asked
him
what
had
become
of
those
photographs
he
illustration
â€œthey
left
him
alone
with
the
deadâ€
tried
to
evade
him
but
it
was
futile
and
he
got
out
the
finished
photographs
and
showed
them
to
him
the
older
man
sat
staring
at
them
a
long
time
â€œhoytâ€
said
he
at
length
â€œyouâ€™re
a
young
man
and
i
suppose
you
have
never
seen
anything
like
this
before
but
i
have
not
exactly
the
same
thing
but
similar
phenomena
have
come
my
way
a
number
of
times
since
i
went
into
the
business
and
i
want
to
tell
you
there
are
things
in
heaven
and
earth
not
dreamt
of----â€
â€œoh
i
know
all
that
tommy-rotâ€
cried
hoyt
angrily
â€œbut
when
anything
happens
i
want
to
know
the
reason
why
and
how
it
is
doneâ€
â€œall
rightâ€
said
his
employer
â€œthen
you
might
explain
why
and
how
the
sun
risesâ€
but
he
humored
the
younger
man
sufficiently
to
examine
with
him
the
bath
in
which
the
plates
were
submerged
and
the
plates
themselves
all
was
as
it
should
be
but
the
mystery
was
there
and
could
not
be
done
away
with
hoyt
hoped
against
hope
that
the
friends
of
the
dead
woman
would
somehow
forget
about
the
photographs
but
of
course
the
wish
was
unreasonable
and
one
day
the
daughter
appeared
and
asked
to
see
the
photographs
of
her
mother
â€œwell
to
tell
the
truthâ€
stammered
hoyt
â€œthose
didnâ€™t
come
out
as
well
as
we
could
wishâ€
â€œbut
let
me
see
themâ€
persisted
the
lady
â€œiâ€™d
like
to
look
at
them
anywayâ€
illustration
â€œhe
showed
her
the
printsâ€
â€œwell
nowâ€
said
hoyt
trying
to
be
soothing
as
he
believed
it
was
always
best
to
be
with
women--to
tell
the
truth
he
was
an
ignoramus
where
women
were
concerned--â€œi
think
it
would
be
better
if
you
didnâ€™t
see
them
there
are
reasons
why----â€
he
ambled
on
like
this
stupid
man
that
he
was
and
of
course
the
jewess
said
she
would
see
those
pictures
without
any
further
delay
so
poor
hoyt
brought
them
out
and
placed
them
in
her
hand
and
then
ran
for
the
water
pitcher
and
had
to
be
at
the
bother
of
bathing
her
forehead
to
keep
her
from
fainting
for
what
the
lady
saw
was
this
over
face
and
flowers
and
the
head
of
the
coffin
fell
a
thick
veil
the
edges
of
which
touched
the
floor
in
some
places
it
covered
the
features
so
well
that
not
a
hint
of
them
was
visible
â€œthere
was
nothing
over
motherâ€™s
faceâ€
cried
the
lady
at
length
â€œnot
a
thingâ€
acquiesced
hoyt
â€œi
know
because
i
had
occasion
to
touch
her
face
just
before
i
took
the
picture
i
put
some
of
her
hair
back
from
her
browâ€
â€œwhat
does
it
mean
thenâ€
asked
the
lady
â€œyou
know
better
than
i
there
is
no
explanation
in
science
perhaps
there
is
some
in
psychologyâ€
â€œwellâ€
said
the
lady
stammering
a
little
and
coloring
â€œmother
was
a
good
woman
but
she
always
wanted
her
own
way
and
she
always
had
it
tooâ€
â€œyesâ€
â€œand
she
never
would
have
her
picture
taken
she
didnâ€™t
admire
herself
she
said
no
one
should
ever
see
a
picture
of
hersâ€
â€œsoâ€
said
hoyt
meditatively
â€œwell
sheâ€™s
kept
her
word
hasnâ€™t
sheâ€
the
two
stood
looking
at
the
pictures
for
a
time
then
hoyt
pointed
to
the
open
blaze
in
the
grate
â€œthrow
them
inâ€
he
commanded
â€œdonâ€™t
let
your
father
see
them--donâ€™t
keep
them
yourself
they
wouldnâ€™t
be
good
things
to
keepâ€
â€œthatâ€™s
true
enoughâ€
said
the
lady
slowly
and
she
threw
them
in
the
fire
then
virgil
hoyt
brought
out
the
plates
and
broke
them
before
her
eyes
and
that
was
the
end
of
it--except
that
hoyt
sometimes
tells
the
story
to
those
who
sit
beside
him
when
his
pipe
is
lighted
the
ghost
of
a
live
man
we
were
in
the
south
atlantic
ocean
in
the
latitude
of
the
island
of
fernando
norohna
about
40
degrees
12
minutes
south
on
board
the
barque
h
g
johnson
homeward
bound
from
australia
i
was
the
only
passenger
and
we
had
safely
rounded
cape
horn
with
the
barometer
at
28
degrees
18
minutes
and
yet
had
somehow
miraculously
escaped
any
extremely
heavy
gale--had
had
light
northerly
and
easterly
winds
till
we
reached
20
degrees
and
thence
the
southeast
trades
were
sending
us
fast
on
our
way
to
the
equator
i
sat
on
deck
smoking
my
pipe
with
a
glorious
full
moon
shedding
its
bright
pathway
across
the
blue
waters
and
chatting
with
the
first
mate
a
man
some
fifty-eight
years
of
age
who
had
followed
the
sea
since
he
was
a
boy
for
twenty
years
or
more
he
had
been
mate
or
captain
and
many
and
varied
were
the
experiences
he
could
relate
a
thorough
sailor
and
skillful
navigator
he
was
as
honest
as
the
day
is
long--had
a
heart
as
big
as
an
ox
and
was
an
all-round
good
fellow
and
genial
companion
some
of
his
yarns
might
be
taken
cum
grano
salis
yet
he
always
positively
assured
me
that
he
â€œwas
telling
me
the
truthâ€
an
account
of
a
voyage
that
he
made
in
a
whaler
from
the
southern
ocean
to
new
bedford
seemed
to
me
worthy
to
be
repeated
he
had
rounded
cape
horn
six
times
and
the
cape
of
good
hope
twenty-six
times
besides
making
many
trips
across
the
western
ocean
and
to
south
american
ports
i
give
his
account
as
near
as
possible
in
his
own
words
â€œit
was
in
â€™71
that
i
commanded
the
whaler
mary
jane
we
had
been
out
from
home
over
three
years
and
had
on
board
a
full
cargo
of
whale
oil
besides
2000
pounds
of
whalebone
which
was
then
worth
5
per
pound
i
also
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
find
in
a
dead
whale
which
we
came
across
a
large
quantity
of
ambergris
and
our
hearts
were
all
very
light
as
we
began
our
homeward
voyage
and
our
thoughts
all
tended
to
the
hearty
welcome
which
we
should
receive
from
wives
and
sweethearts
when
we
reached
our
journeyâ€™s
end
many
a
night
as
i
lay
in
my
berth
i
had
thought
with
great
pleasure
of
the
amount
of
money
that
would
be
coming
to
me
from
the
proceeds
of
our
voyage
when
we
arrived
in
new
bedford
â€œi
calculated
that
i
had
made
12000
as
my
share
of
the
proceeds
of
the
whalebone
and
oil--to
say
nothing
of
the
ambergris
which
i
well
knew
would
bring
at
least
20000
and
one-half
of
which
belonged
to
me
you
can
therefore
imagine
that
i
was
well
pleased
with
myself
as
we
went
bounding
along
through
the
southeast
trades
we
crossed
the
equator
in
longitude
36
and
soon
after
took
strong
northeast
trades
and
all
was
going
as
well
as
i
could
wish
we
had
put
the
ship
in
perfect
order
painted
her
inside
and
out
and
you
would
never
have
recognized
her
as
the
old
whaling
ship
that
had
for
three
years
been
plying
the
southern
ocean
for
whales
never
shall
i
forget
an
old
bull
whale
that
we
tackled
about
two
degrees
to
the
south
of
cape
horn--but
that
is
another
story
which
i
will
give
you
another
time
â€œwe
had
just
lost
the
northeast
trades
and
were
entering
the
gulf
stream
i
sat
in
my
cabin
with
my
chart
on
the
table
before
me
rolled
up
i
had
just
picked
our
location
on
it
and
was
thinking
that
in
a
week
more
i
should
be
at
home
surrounded
by
those
near
and
dear
to
me
and
relating
to
them
the
story
of
my
great
good
fortune
â€œit
was
always
my
custom
to
work
up
my
latitude
and
longitude
about
four
oâ€™clock
in
the
afternoon
and
then
after
supper
pick
off
her
position
on
the
chart
have
a
smoke
and
perhaps
just
before
retiring
a
nip
of
grog
and
then
at
830
oâ€™clock
as
regular
as
a
clock
i
would
turn
in
â€œi
am
a
great
smoker
and
this
day
i
had
been
smoking
all
the
afternoon
besides
having
had
two
or
three
nips
we
had
a
dog
on
board
whom
we
called
â€˜bosunâ€™
who
had
been
out
with
us
all
the
voyage
and
who
was
afraid
of
nothing
he
had
endeared
himself
to
every
man
on
board
and
when
bosun
â€˜took
waterâ€™
something
very
serious
was
in
the
wind
this
night
as
i
sat
in
the
cabin
i
heard
a
most
dismal
howl
from
bosun
and
called
out
to
the
mate
to
know
what
was
the
matter
with
the
dog
he
replied
that
he
â€˜reckoned
some
of
the
men
had
been
teasing
himâ€™
and
the
occurrence
soon
passed
from
my
mind
â€œsuddenly
i
saw
someone
coming
down
the
after
companion
way
into
the
cabin
i
supposed
at
first
it
was
the
mate
and
wondered
that
he
had
not
first
spoken
to
me
but
then
i
noticed
that
he
wore
clothes
i
had
never
seen
on
the
mate
and
as
he
advanced
into
the
cabin
i
saw
his
face
it
was
the
face
of
a
man
i
had
never
seen
in
my
life
he
was
thin
and
pale
and
haggard
and
as
he
advanced
he
looked
about
the
cabin
and
at
the
rolled
up
chart
on
the
table
there
seemed
to
be
an
appeal
in
his
eyes
and
then
there
swept
over
his
face
a
look
of
intense
disappointment
and
before
i
could
move
or
speak
he
had
vanished
from
my
sight
â€œnow
i
am
a
very
practical
man
and
i
at
once
straightened
myself
in
my
chair
and
said
to
myself
â€˜well
old
man
you
have
smoked
one
too
many
pipes
to-day
or
else
you
have
had
one
drink
too
much
for
you
have
been
asleep
in
your
chair
and
seen
a
ghostâ€™
i
was
quite
satisfied
that
i
had
had
a
dream
especially
as
i
called
to
the
mate
and
asked
him
if
he
had
seen
anyone
come
below
he
said
no
that
he
had
not
left
the
deck
for
the
last
hour
and
the
man
at
the
wheel
directly
in
front
of
the
door
was
sure
no
one
had
entered
the
cabin
so
i
convinced
myself
that
i
had
had
a
very
vivid
dream--though
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
matter
all
through
the
next
day
â€œat
eight
oâ€™clock
the
next
evening
i
sat
in
the
same
place
with
my
work
just
finished
and
the
chart
lying
rolled
up
on
the
table
before
me
when
suddenly
the
dogâ€™s
dismal
howl
rang
through
the
ship
and
looking
up
i
saw
those
same
legs
coming
down
the
after
companion
my
hair
fairly
stood
on
end
and
yet
to-day
surely
i
was
wide
awake
i
had
only
smoked
one
pipe
all
day
and
had
not
touched
a
drop
of
liquor
the
same
wan
emaciated
figure
walked
into
the
cabin
glanced
inquiringly
and
appealingly
at
me
and
again
there
spread
over
his
face
that
look
of
utter
disappointment
as
if
he
had
sought
something
and
failed
to
find
it
and
again
he
disappeared
i
rushed
on
deck
to
the
mate
and
told
him
all
i
had
seen
during
the
last
two
nights
but
he
made
light
of
it
and
assured
me
i
had
been
asleep
or
smoking
too
much
he
did
not
like
to
suggest
that
i
had
been
drinking
still
i
could
see
that
the
thought
that
came
into
his
mind
was
â€˜the
old
man
has
seen
â€™em
againâ€™
i
gave
up
trying
to
convince
him
but
requested
that
the
next
night
from
8
to
830
he
should
sit
with
me
in
the
cabin
â€œhow
the
next
day
passed
i
cannot
tell
i
only
know
that
my
thoughts
never
left
that
ghostly
visitant
and
somehow
i
felt
that
the
evening
would
reveal
something
to
me
and
the
spell
be
broken
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
speak
to
the
thing
whatever
it
was
and
i
felt
a
sort
of
security
in
the
presence
of
the
mate
who
was
a
daring
fellow
and
feared
neither
man
nor
the
devil
neither
rum
nor
tobacco
passed
my
lips
during
the
next
day
and
eight
oâ€™clock
found
the
mate
and
i
sitting
in
the
cabin
and
this
time
the
chart
lay
open
on
the
table
beside
us
just
as
eight
bells
struck
the
dogâ€™s
premonitory
wail
sounded
and
looking
up
we
both
saw
the
figure
descending
the
cabin
stairs
we
both
seemed
frozen
to
our
seats
and
the
strange
weirdness
of
the
whole
proceeding
cast
the
same
spell
over
the
mate
and
me
alike
and
we
were
both
unable
to
move
or
speak
slowly
the
figure
proceeded
into
the
cabin
and
glanced
around
without
a
word
but
with
the
same
expectant
look
on
his
face
his
form
was
even
more
wasted
his
cheeks
sunken
and
his
eyes
seemed
almost
out
of
sight
so
deeply
were
they
set
in
their
sockets
as
his
eye
fell
on
the
open
chart
a
look
of
supreme
joy
fairly
irradiated
his
features
and
advancing
to
the
table
he
placed
one
long
bony
finger
on
the
chart
held
it
for
a
moment
and
then
again
disappeared
from
our
sight
â€œfor
five
minutes
after
he
had
left
us
we
sat
speechless
then
i
managed
to
say
â€˜what
do
you
think
of
that
mr
morrisâ€™
â€˜my
god
sir
i
donâ€™t
know--itâ€™s
beyond
meâ€™
then
my
eyes
fell
on
the
open
chart
and
there
where
the
finger
had
been
was
a
tiny
spot
of
blood
exactly
on
the
point
of
longitude
63
degrees
west
and
latitude
37
degrees
north
we
were
then
only
about
fifty
miles
distant
from
that
position
and
immediately
there
came
to
me
the
determination
to
steer
the
ship
there
so
i
laid
her
course
accordingly
and
posted
a
lookout
in
the
crowâ€™s
nest
at
five
oâ€™clock
in
the
morning
just
as
the
east
began
to
grow
gray
the
lookout
called
out
â€˜boat
on
the
lee
bowâ€™
and
as
we
came
up
to
it
we
found
four
men
in
it--three
dead
and
one
with
just
a
remnant
of
life
left
in
him
we
sewed
the
three
bodies
in
canvas
and
buried
them
in
the
ocean
and
then
gave
all
our
attention
to
restoring
life
to
the
poor
emaciated
frame
which
i
then
recognized
was
the
very
man
who
for
three
successive
nights
had
visited
me
in
my
cabin
â€œby
judicious
and
careful
nursing
life
gradually
came
back
to
him
and
in
four
daysâ€™
time
he
was
able
to
sit
up
and
talk
with
me
in
the
cabin
it
seems
he
commanded
the
ship
promise
and
she
had
taken
fire
and
been
destroyed
and
all
hands
had
to
take
to
the
boats
ten
were
in
the
boats
at
first
but
their
food
had
given
out
and
one
by
one
he
had
seen
them
die
and
one
by
one
he
had
cast
the
bodies
overboard
finally
he
lost
consciousness
and
knew
not
whether
his
three
remaining
companions
were
dead
or
alive
â€œthen
he
said
he
seemed
in
a
dream
to
see
a
ship
and
tried
to
go
to
her
for
help
but
just
as
he
would
be
going
on
board
of
her
something
would
seem
to
keep
him
back
three
times
in
his
dreams
he
tried
to
visit
this
ship
and
the
last
time
there
seemed
to
come
to
him
a
certain
satisfaction
and
he
felt
that
he
had
succeeded
in
his
object
turning
to
my
table
he
said
â€˜let
me
take
your
chart
iâ€™ll
show
you
just
where
we
wereâ€™
â€œâ€˜stopâ€™
said
i
â€˜donâ€™t
take
that
chart
it
is
an
old
one
and
all
marked
over
mark
your
position
on
this
new
oneâ€™
he
took
my
pencil
and
knife
and
carefully
sharpened
his
pencil
then
taking
my
dividers
he
measured
his
latitude
and
longitude
and
placed
a
pencil
dot
at
a
point
on
the
clean
chart
as
he
lifted
his
hand
he
said
â€˜oh
excuse
me
captain
i
cut
my
finger
in
sharpening
the
pencil
and
have
left
a
drop
of
blood
on
the
chartâ€™
â€œâ€˜never
mindâ€™
said
i
â€˜leave
it
thereâ€™
and
then
i
produced
the
old
chart
and
there
in
an
exactly
corresponding
place
was
the
drop
of
blood
left
by
my
ghostly
visitorâ€
then
looking
steadily
into
my
face
the
mate
solemnly
added
â€œi
canâ€™t
explain
this
sir
perhaps
you
can
but
i
can
tell
you
on
my
honor
it
is
godâ€™s
own
truth
that
i
have
told
youâ€
the
ghost
of
washington
it
was
early
on
christmas
morning
when
john
reilly
wheeled
away
from
a
picturesque
little
village
where
he
had
passed
the
previous
night
to
continue
his
cycling
tour
through
eastern
pennsylvania
to-day
his
intention
was
to
stop
at
valley
forge
and
then
to
ride
on
up
the
schuylkill
valley
visiting
in
turn
the
many
points
of
historical
interest
that
lay
along
his
route
valley
forge
his
road
map
indicated
was
but
a
short
distance
further
on
all
around
him
were
the
hills
and
fields
and
roads
over
which
washington
and
his
half-starved
army
had
foraged
and
roamed
throughout
the
trying
winter
of
1777-8--one
hundred
and
twenty-six
years
ago
it
was
a
beautiful
christmas
day
truly
and
as
he
wheeled
along
young
reillyâ€™s
thoughts
were
almost
equally
divided
between
the
surrounding
pleasant
scenery
and
the
folks
at
home
who
he
knew
very
well
were
assembling
at
just
about
the
present
time
around
a
heavily
laden
christmas
tree
in
the
front
parlor
the
sun
rose
higher
and
higher
and
reilly
pedaled
on
down
the
valley
passing
every
now
and
then
quaint
pleasant-looking
farmhouses
many
of
which
no
doubt
had
been
built
anterior
to
the
period
which
had
given
the
vicinity
its
history
arriving
finally
at
a
place
where
the
road
forked
off
in
two
directions
reilly
was
puzzled
which
way
to
go
on
there
happened
to
be
a
dwelling
close
by
accordingly
he
dismounted
left
his
wheel
leaning
against
a
gate-post
at
the
side
of
the
road
and
walked
up
a
wretchedly
flagged
walk
leading
to
the
house
with
the
idea
of
getting
instructions
from
its
inmates
situated
in
the
center
of
an
unkempt
field
of
rank
grass
and
weeds
the
building
lay
back
from
the
highway
probably
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
it
was
long
and
low
in
shape
containing
but
one
story
and
having
what
is
termed
a
gabled
roof
under
which
there
must
have
been
an
attic
of
no
mean
size
on
coming
close
to
the
house
a
fact
reilly
had
not
noticed
from
the
road
became
plainly
evident
it
was
deserted
he
saw
that
the
roof
and
side
shingles
were
in
wretched
condition
that
the
window
sashes
and
frames
as
well
as
the
doors
and
door
frames
were
missing
from
the
openings
in
the
side
walls
where
once
they
had
been
and
that
the
entire
side
of
the
house
including
that
part
of
the
stone
foundation
which
showed
above
the
ground
was
full
of
cracks
and
seams
at
first
on
the
point
of
turning
back
he
concluded
to
see
what
the
interior
was
like
anyway
accordingly
he
went
inside
glancing
around
the
large
dust-filled
room
he
had
entered
his
gaze
at
first
failed
to
locate
any
object
of
the
least
interest
a
rickety
appearing
set
of
steps
went
up
into
the
attic
from
one
side
of
the
apartment
and
over
in
one
corner
was
a
large
open
fireplace
from
the
walls
of
which
much
of
the
brickwork
had
become
loosened
and
fallen
out
reilly
had
started
up
the
steps
toward
the
attic
when
happening
to
look
back
for
an
instant
his
attention
was
attracted
to
a
singular-looking
jug-shaped
bottle
no
larger
than
a
vinegar
cruet
which
lay
upon
its
side
on
the
hearth
of
the
fireplace
partly
covered
up
by
debris
of
loose
bricks
and
mortar
he
hastened
back
down
the
steps
and
crossed
the
room
taking
the
bottle
up
in
his
hand
and
examining
it
with
curiosity
being
partly
filled
with
a
liquid
of
some
kind
or
other
the
bottle
was
very
soon
uncorked
and
held
under
the
young
manâ€™s
nose
the
liquid
gave
forth
a
peculiar
pungent
and
inviting
odor
without
further
hesitation
reillyâ€™s
lips
sought
the
neck
of
the
bottle
it
is
hardly
possible
to
describe
the
pleasure
and
satisfaction
his
senses
experienced
as
he
drank
while
the
fluid
was
still
gurgling
down
his
throat
a
heavy
hand
was
placed
most
suddenly
on
his
shoulder
and
his
body
was
given
a
violent
shaking
the
bottle
fell
to
the
floor
and
was
broken
into
a
hundred
pieces
â€œhelloâ€
said
a
rough
voice
almost
in
reillyâ€™s
ear
â€œwho
are
you
anyway
and
what
are
you
doing
within
the
lines
a
spy
iâ€™ll
be
boundâ€
as
most
assuredly
there
had
been
no
one
else
in
the
vicinity
of
the
building
when
he
had
entered
it
and
with
equal
certainty
no
one
had
come
down
the
steps
from
the
attic
reilly
was
naturally
surprised
and
mystified
by
this
unexpected
assault
he
struggled
instinctively
to
break
loose
from
the
unfriendly
grasp
and
when
he
finally
succeeded
he
twisted
his
body
around
so
that
he
faced
across
the
room
immediately
he
made
the
remarkable
discovery
that
there
were
four
other
persons
in
the
apartment--three
uncouth-looking
fellows
habited
in
fantastic
but
ragged
garments
and
a
matronly-looking
woman
the
latter
standing
over
a
washtub
which
had
been
elevated
upon
two
chairs
in
a
corner
near
the
fireplace
to
all
appearance
the
woman
had
been
busy
at
her
work
and
had
stopped
for
the
moment
to
see
what
the
men
were
going
to
do
her
waist
sleeves
were
rolled
up
to
the
shoulders
and
her
arms
dripped
with
water
and
soapsuds
over
the
tops
of
the
tubs
partly
filled
with
water
there
were
visible
the
edges
of
several
well-soaked
fabrics
too
add
to
his
astonishment
he
noticed
that
in
the
chimney-place
which
a
moment
before
was
falling
apart
but
now
seemed
to
be
clean
and
in
good
condition
a
cheerful
fire
burned
and
that
above
the
flames
was
suspended
an
iron
pot
from
which
issued
a
jet
of
steam
he
noticed
also
that
the
entire
appearance
of
the
room
had
undergone
a
great
change
everything
seemed
to
be
in
good
repair
tidy
and
neat
the
ceilings
the
walls
and
the
door
even
the
stairway
leading
to
the
attic
the
openings
in
the
walls
were
fitted
with
window
sashes
and
well-painted
doors
the
apartment
had
in
fact
evolved
under
his
very
eyesight
from
a
state
of
absolute
ruin
into
one
of
excellent
preservation
all
of
this
seemed
so
weird
and
uncanny
that
reilly
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
in
the
transformed
apartment
utterly
dumbfounded
with
his
mouth
wide
open
and
his
eyes
all
but
popping
out
of
his
head
he
was
brought
to
his
senses
by
the
fellow
who
had
shaken
him
growling
out
â€œcome
explain
yourselfâ€
â€œan
explanation
is
due
meâ€
reilly
managed
to
gasp
â€œdonâ€™t
bandy
words
with
the
rascal
harryâ€
one
of
the
other
men
spoke
up
â€œbring
him
along
to
headquartersâ€
thereupon
without
further
parley
the
three
men
marched
reilly
in
military
fashion
into
the
open
air
and
down
to
the
road
here
he
picked
up
at
the
gate-post
his
bicycle
while
they
unstacked
a
group
of
three
old-fashioned-looking
muskets
located
close
by
when
the
young
man
had
entered
the
house
a
few
minutes
before
this
stack
of
arms
had
not
been
there
he
could
not
understand
it
neither
could
he
understand
on
looking
back
at
the
building
as
he
was
marched
off
down
the
road
the
mysterious
agency
that
had
transformed
its
dilapidated
exterior
just
as
had
been
the
interior
into
a
practically
new
condition
while
they
trudged
along
the
strangers
exhibited
a
singular
interest
in
the
wheel
reilly
pushed
at
his
side
running
their
coarse
hands
over
the
frame
and
handle-bar
and
acting
on
the
whole
as
though
they
never
before
had
seen
a
bicycle
this
in
itself
was
another
surprise
he
had
hardly
supposed
there
were
three
men
in
the
country
so
totally
unacquainted
with
what
is
a
most
familiar
piece
of
mechanism
everywhere
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
paying
so
much
attention
to
the
wheel
reilly
in
turn
was
studying
with
great
curiosity
his
singular-looking
captors
rough
unprepossessing
appearing
fellows
they
were
large
of
frame
and
unshaven
and
it
must
be
added
dirty
of
face
what
remained
of
their
very
ragged
clothing
he
had
already
noticed
was
of
a
most
remarkable
cut
and
design
resembling
closely
the
garments
worn
by
the
continental
militiamen
in
the
war
of
independence
the
hats
were
broad
low
of
crown
and
three-cornered
in
shape
the
trousers
were
buff-colored
and
ended
at
the
knees
and
the
long
blue
spike-tailed
coats
were
flapped
over
at
the
extremities
of
the
tails
the
flaps
being
fastened
down
with
good-sized
brass
buttons
leather
leggings
were
strapped
around
cowhide
boots
through
the
badly
worn
feet
of
which
in
places
where
the
leather
had
cracked
open
the
flesh
unprotected
by
stockings
could
be
seen
dressed
as
he
was
in
a
cleanly
gray
cycling
costume
reillyâ€™s
appearance
most
assuredly
was
strongly
in
contrast
to
that
of
his
companions
after
a
brisk
walk
of
twenty
minutes
during
which
they
occasionally
met
and
passed
by
one
or
two
or
perhaps
a
group
of
men
clothed
and
outfitted
like
reillyâ€™s
escorts
the
little
party
followed
the
road
up
a
slight
incline
and
around
a
well-wooded
bend
to
the
left
coming
quite
suddenly
and
to
the
captive
very
unexpectedly
to
what
was
without
doubt
a
military
encampment
a
village
in
fact
composed
of
many
rows
of
small
log
huts
along
the
streets
between
the
buildings
muskets
were
stacked
in
hundreds
of
places
over
in
one
corner
on
a
slight
eminence
commanding
the
road
up
which
they
had
come
and
cleverly
hidden
from
it
behind
trees
and
shrubbery
the
young
man
noticed
a
battery
of
field
pieces
wherever
the
eye
was
turned
on
this
singular
scene
were
countless
numbers
of
soldiers
all
garmented
in
three-cornered
hats
spike-tailed
coats
and
knee
breeches
walking
lazily
hither
and
thither
grouped
around
crackling
fires
or
parading
up
and
down
the
streets
in
platoons
under
the
guidance
of
ragged
but
stern-looking
officers
harry
stopped
the
little
procession
of
four
in
front
of
one
of
the
larger
of
the
log
houses
then
while
they
stood
there
the
long
blast
from
a
bugle
was
heard
followed
by
the
roll
of
drums
a
minute
or
two
afterward
several
companies
of
militia
marched
up
and
grounded
their
arms
forming
three
sides
of
a
hollow
square
around
them
the
fourth
and
open
side
being
toward
the
log
house
directly
succeeding
this
maneuver
there
came
through
the
doorway
of
the
house
and
stepped
up
the
center
of
the
square
stopping
directly
in
front
of
reilly
a
dignified-looking
person
tall
and
straight
and
splendidly
proportioned
of
figure
and
having
a
face
of
great
nobility
and
character
the
cold
chills
chased
one
another
down
reillyâ€™s
back
his
limbs
swayed
and
tottered
beneath
his
weight
he
had
never
experienced
another
such
sensation
of
mingled
astonishment
and
fright
he
was
in
the
presence
of
general
washington
not
a
phantom
washington
either
but
washington
in
the
flesh
and
blood
as
material
and
earthly
a
being
as
ever
crossed
a
personâ€™s
line
of
vision
reilly
in
his
time
had
seen
so
many
portraits
marble
busts
and
statues
of
the
great
commander
that
he
could
not
be
mistaken
recovering
the
use
of
his
faculties
which
for
the
moment
he
seemed
to
have
lost
reilly
did
the
very
commonplace
thing
that
others
before
him
have
done
when
placed
unexpectedly
in
remarkable
situations
he
pinched
himself
to
make
sure
that
he
was
in
reality
wide
awake
and
in
the
natural
possession
of
his
senses
he
felt
like
pinching
the
figure
in
front
of
him
also
but
he
could
not
muster
up
the
courage
to
do
that
he
stood
there
trying
to
think
it
all
out
and
as
his
thoughts
became
less
stagnant
his
fright
dissolved
under
the
process
of
reasoning
his
mind
pursued
to
reason
a
thing
out
even
though
an
explanation
can
only
be
obtained
by
leaving
much
of
the
subject
unaccounted
for
tends
to
make
one
bolder
and
less
shaky
in
the
knees
the
series
of
strange
incidents
which
he
was
experiencing
had
been
inaugurated
in
the
old-fashioned
dwelling
he
had
visited
after
information
concerning
the
roads
and
everything
had
been
going
along
in
a
perfectly
normal
way
up
to
the
very
moment
when
he
had
taken
a
drink
from
the
bottle
found
in
the
fireplace
but
from
that
precise
time
everything
had
gone
wrongly
hence
the
inference
that
the
drinking
of
the
peculiar
liquid
was
accountable
in
some
way
or
other
for
his
troubles
there
was
a
supernatural
agency
in
the
whole
thing
that
much
must
be
admitted
and
whatever
that
agency
was
and
however
it
might
be
accounted
for
it
had
taken
reilly
back
into
a
period
of
time
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
and
landed
him
body
and
soul
within
the
lines
of
the
patriot
forces
wintering
at
valley
forge
he
might
have
stood
there
turning
over
and
over
in
his
mind
pinching
himself
and
muttering
all
the
morning
had
not
the
newcomer
ceased
a
silent
but
curious
inspection
of
his
person
and
asked
â€œwho
are
you
sirâ€
â€œjohn
reilly
at
your
pleasureâ€
the
young
man
replied
adding
a
question
on
his
own
account
â€œand
who
are
you
sirâ€
immediately
he
received
a
heavy
thump
on
his
back
from
harryâ€™s
hard
fist
â€œit
is
not
for
you
to
question
the
generalâ€
the
ragged
administrator
of
the
blow
exclaimed
â€œand
it
is
not
for
you
to
be
so
gayâ€
reilly
returned
angrily
giving
the
blow
back
with
added
force
â€œhere
hereâ€
broke
in
the
first
questioner
â€œfisticuffs
under
my
very
nose
no
more
of
this
i
command
you
bothâ€
to
harry
he
added
an
extra
caution
â€œyour
zeal
in
my
behalf
will
be
better
appreciated
by
being
less
demonstrative
blows
should
be
struck
only
on
the
battlefieldâ€
to
reilly
he
said
with
a
slight
smile
hovering
over
his
face
â€œmy
name
is
washington
perhaps
you
may
have
heard
of
meâ€
to
this
reilly
replied
â€œi
have
indeed
and
heard
you
very
well
spoken
of
tooâ€
emboldened
by
the
otherâ€™s
smile
he
ventured
another
question
â€œi
think
my
reckoning
of
the
day
and
year
is
badly
at
fault
an
hour
ago
i
thought
the
day
was
christmas
day
how
far
out
of
the
way
did
my
calculation
take
me
sirâ€
â€œthe
day
is
indeed
christmas
day
and
the
year
is
as
you
must
know
the
year
of
our
lord
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seventy-sevenâ€
reilly
again
pinched
himself
â€œwhy
do
you
bring
this
man
to
meâ€
washington
now
inquired
turning
to
harry
and
his
companions
â€œhe
is
a
spy
sirâ€
said
harry
â€œthat
is
a
lieâ€
reilly
indignantly
interpolated
â€œi
have
done
nothing
to
warrant
any
such
chargeâ€
â€œwe
found
him
in
the
widow
robinâ€™s
house
pouring
strong
liquor
down
his
throatâ€
â€œi
had
gone
inside
after
information
concerning
the
roads----â€
â€œwhich
he
was
getting
from
a
bottle
sirâ€
â€œif
drinking
from
a
bottle
of
necessity
constitutes
being
a
spy
i
fear
our
camp
is
already
a
hotbedâ€
washington
somewhat
sagely
remarked
casting
his
eye
around
slyly
at
his
officers
and
men
â€œtell
meâ€
he
went
on
with
sudden
sternness
looking
reilly
through
and
through
as
though
to
read
his
very
thoughts
â€œis
the
charge
true
do
you
come
from
howeâ€
â€œthe
charge
is
not
true
sir
i
come
from
no
one
i
simply
am
making
a
tour
of
pleasure
through
this
part
of
the
country
on
my
bicycleâ€
â€œwith
the
country
swarming
with
the
men
from
two
hostile
armies
any
kind
of
a
tour
save
one
of
absolute
necessity
seems
ill-timedâ€
â€œwhen
i
set
out
i
knew
nothing
about
any
armies
the
fact
is
sir----â€
reilly
started
to
make
an
explanation
but
he
checked
himself
on
realizing
that
the
telling
of
any
such
improbable
yarn
would
only
increase
the
hazardousness
of
his
position
â€œwellâ€
washington
questioned
in
a
tone
of
growing
suspicion
â€œi
certainly
did
not
know
that
your
army
or
any
other
army
was
quartered
in
this
vicinityâ€
reilly
hesitated
for
lack
of
something
further
to
say
â€œyou
seeâ€
he
finally
added
prompted
by
a
happy
idea
â€œi
rode
my
wheel
from
new
yorkâ€
â€œyou
may
have
come
from
new
york
though
it
is
hard
to
believe
you
came
on
that
singular-looking
machine
so
great
a
distance
where
is
the
horse
which
drew
the
vehicleâ€
reilly
touched
his
bicycle
â€œthis
is
the
horse
sir
just
as
it
is
the
vehicleâ€
he
said
â€œthe
man
is
crazyâ€
harry
exclaimed
washington
only
looked
the
incredulity
he
felt
and
this
time
asked
a
double
question
â€œhow
can
the
thing
be
balanced
without
it
be
held
upright
by
a
pair
of
shafts
from
a
horseâ€™s
back
and
how
is
the
motive
power
acquiredâ€
for
an
answer
reilly
jumped
upon
the
wheel
and
at
a
considerable
speed
and
in
a
haphazard
way
pedaled
around
the
space
within
the
hollow
square
of
soldiers
hither
and
thither
he
went
at
one
second
nearly
wheeling
over
the
toes
of
the
line
of
astonished
if
not
frightened
militiamen
at
the
next
bearing
suddenly
down
on
harry
and
his
companions
and
making
them
dance
and
jump
about
most
alertly
to
avoid
a
collision
even
the
dignified
washington
was
once
or
twice
put
to
the
necessity
of
dodging
hurriedly
aside
when
his
equilibrium
was
threatened
reilly
eventually
dismounted
doing
so
with
assumed
clumsiness
by
stopping
the
wheel
at
harryâ€™s
back
and
falling
over
heavily
against
the
soldier
harry
tumbled
to
the
ground
but
reilly
dexterously
landed
on
his
feet
at
once
he
began
offering
a
profusion
of
apologies
â€œyou
did
that
by
designâ€
harry
shouted
jumping
to
his
feet
his
face
was
red
with
anger
and
he
shook
his
fist
threateningly
at
the
bicyclist
washington
commanded
the
man
to
hold
his
peace
then
to
reilly
he
expressed
a
great
surprise
at
his
performance
and
a
desire
to
know
more
about
the
bicycle
the
young
man
thereupon
described
the
machine
minutely
lifting
it
into
the
air
and
spinning
the
wheels
to
illustrate
how
smoothly
they
rotated
â€œi
can
see
it
is
possible
to
ride
the
contrivance
with
rapidity
it
has
been
put
together
with
wonderful
ingenuityâ€
washington
said
when
reilly
had
replaced
the
wheel
on
the
ground
â€œand
you
sir
it
is
but
a
toyâ€
an
officer
spoke
up
â€œput
our
friend
on
his
bundle
of
tin
and
race
him
against
one
of
our
horsemen
and
he
would
make
a
sorry
showingâ€
reilly
smiled
â€œi
bear
the
gentleman
no
ill-will
for
his
opinionâ€
he
said
â€œstill
i
should
like
to
show
him
by
a
practical
test
of
the
subject
that
his
ignorance
of
it
is
most
profoundâ€
â€œyou
would
test
the
speed
of
the
machine
against
that
of
a
horseâ€
washington
said
in
amazement
â€œi
would
sir
you
have
a
good
road
yonder
with
your
permission
and
a
worthy
opponent
i
would
make
the
test
at
onceâ€
â€œbut
sir
the
man
is
a
spyâ€
harry
broke
in
â€œwould
it
not
be
better
to
throw
a
rope
around
his
neck
and
give
him
his
desertsâ€
â€œthe
charge
is
by
no
means
provenâ€
washington
replied
â€œnor
can
it
be
until
a
court
martial
convenes
this
afternoon
and
i
see
no
reason
why
we
may
not
in
the
meantime
enjoy
the
unique
contest
which
has
been
suggested
it
will
make
a
pleasant
break
in
the
routine
of
camp
lifeâ€
a
murmur
of
approval
went
up
from
the
masses
of
men
by
whom
they
were
surrounded
while
they
had
been
talking
it
seemed
as
though
everybody
in
the
camp
not
already
on
the
scene
had
gathered
together
behind
the
square
of
infantry
â€œthen
sirâ€
harry
said
with
some
eagerness
â€œi
would
like
to
be
the
man
to
ride
the
horse
there
is
no
better
animal
than
mine
anywhere
and
i
understand
his
tricks
and
humors
quite
well
enough
to
put
him
to
his
best
paceâ€
â€œi
confess
i
have
heard
you
well
spoken
of
as
a
horsemanâ€
washington
said
â€œbe
away
with
you
saddle
and
bridle
your
horse
at
onceâ€
it
was
the
chain
of
singular
circumstances
narrated
above
which
brought
john
reilly
into
the
most
remarkable
contest
of
his
life
he
had
entered
many
bicycle
races
at
one
time
or
other
always
with
credit
to
himself
and
to
the
club
whose
colors
he
wore
and
he
had
every
expectation
of
making
a
good
showing
to-day
yet
a
reflection
of
the
weird
conditions
which
had
brought
about
the
present
contest
took
away
some
of
his
self-possession
when
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
marched
over
to
the
turnpike
and
left
to
his
own
thoughts
while
the
officers
were
pacing
out
a
one
mile
straightaway
course
down
the
road
after
the
measurements
had
been
taken
two
unbroken
lines
of
soldiers
were
formed
along
the
entire
mile
a
most
evident
precaution
against
reilly
leaving
the
race
course
at
any
point
to
escape
across
the
fields
washington
came
up
to
him
again
when
the
preparations
were
completed
to
shake
his
hand
and
whisper
a
word
or
two
of
encouragement
in
his
ear
having
performed
these
kindly
acts
he
left
to
take
up
a
position
near
the
point
of
finish
the
beginning
of
the
course
was
located
close
to
the
battery
of
half
concealed
field
pieces
reilly
was
now
conducted
to
this
place
shortly
afterward
harry
appeared
on
his
horse
he
leered
at
the
bicyclist
contemptuously
and
said
something
of
a
sarcastic
nature
partly
under
his
breath
when
the
two
lined
up
side
by
side
for
the
start
to
these
slights
reilly
paid
no
heed
he
had
a
strong
belief
that
when
the
race
was
over
there
would
be
left
in
the
mutton-like
head
of
his
opponent
very
little
of
his
present
inclination
toward
the
humorous
the
soldierâ€™s
mount
was
a
handsome
black
mare
fourteen
and
a
half
hands
high
strong
of
limbs
and
at
the
flanks
and
animated
by
a
spirit
that
kept
her
prancing
around
with
continuous
action
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
man
rode
very
well
he
guided
the
animal
with
ease
and
nonchalance
when
she
reared
and
plunged
and
kept
her
movements
confined
to
an
incredibly
small
piece
of
ground
considering
her
abundance
of
action
â€œkeep
to
your
own
side
of
the
road
throughout
the
race
i
donâ€™t
want
to
be
collided
with
by
your
big
beastâ€
reilly
cautioned
while
they
were
awaiting
two
signals
from
the
starter
to
this
harry
replied
in
some
derision
â€œiâ€™ll
give
you
a
good
share
of
the
road
at
the
start
and
all
of
it
and
my
dust
too
afterwardâ€
and
then
the
officer
who
held
the
pistol
fired
the
first
shot
reilly
was
well
satisfied
with
the
conditions
under
which
the
race
was
to
be
made
the
road
was
wide
and
level
smooth
hard
and
straight
and
a
strong
breeze
which
had
sprung
up
blew
squarely
against
his
back
his
wheel
was
geared
up
to
eighty-four
inches
the
breeze
promised
to
be
a
valuable
adjunct
in
pushing
it
along
awaiting
the
second
and
last
signal
reilly
glanced
down
the
two
blue
ranks
of
soldiers
which
stretched
away
into
hazy
lines
in
the
distance
and
converged
at
the
termination
of
the
course
where
a
flag
had
been
stuck
into
the
ground
the
soldiers
were
at
parade
rest
their
unceasing
movements
as
they
chatted
to
one
another
turning
their
bodies
this
way
and
that
and
craning
their
heads
forward
to
look
toward
the
starting
point
and
then
jerking
them
back
made
the
lines
seem
like
long
squirming
snakes
at
the
end
of
the
course
a
thick
bunch
of
militiamen
clogged
the
road
and
overspread
into
the
fields
crack
the
signal
to
be
off
reilly
shoved
aside
the
fellow
who
had
been
holding
his
wheel
upright
while
astride
of
it
and
pushed
down
on
the
pedals
the
mareâ€™s
hoofs
dug
the
earth
her
great
muscular
legs
straightened
out
she
sprang
forward
with
a
snort
of
apparent
pleasure
taking
the
lead
at
the
very
start
reilly
heard
the
shout
of
excitement
run
along
the
two
ranks
of
soldiers
he
saw
them
waving
their
arms
and
hats
as
he
went
by
and
on
ahead
through
the
cloud
of
dust
there
was
visible
the
shadow-like
outlines
of
the
snorting
galloping
horse
whose
hoof
beats
sounded
clear
and
sharp
above
the
din
which
came
from
the
sides
of
the
highway
the
mare
crept
farther
and
farther
ahead
very
soon
a
hundred
feet
or
more
of
the
road
lay
between
her
and
the
bicyclist
harry
turned
in
his
saddle
and
called
out
another
sarcasm
â€œi
shall
pass
you
very
soon
keep
to
your
own
side
of
the
roadâ€
reilly
shouted
not
a
bit
daunted
by
the
way
the
race
had
commenced
his
head
was
well
down
over
the
handle-bars
his
back
had
the
shape
of
the
upper
portion
of
an
immense
egg
up
and
down
his
legs
moved
faster
and
faster
and
faster
yet
he
went
by
the
soldiers
so
rapidly
that
they
only
appeared
to
be
two
streaks
of
blurry
color
their
sharp
rasping
shouts
sounded
like
the
cracking
of
musketry
the
cloud
of
dust
blew
against
the
bicyclistâ€™s
head
and
into
his
mouth
and
throat
when
he
glanced
ahead
again
he
saw
with
satisfaction
that
the
mare
was
no
longer
increasing
her
lead
it
soon
became
evident
even
that
he
was
slowly
cutting
down
the
advantages
she
had
secured
harry
again
turned
his
head
shortly
afterward
doubtless
expecting
to
find
his
opponent
hopelessly
distanced
by
this
time
instead
of
this
reilly
was
alarmingly
close
upon
him
the
man
ejaculated
a
sudden
oath
and
lashed
his
animal
furiously
straining
every
nerve
and
sinew
the
mare
for
the
moment
pushed
further
ahead
then
her
pace
slackened
a
bit
and
reilly
again
crept
up
to
her
closer
and
closer
to
her
than
before
until
his
head
was
abreast
of
her
outstretched
tail
harry
was
lashing
the
mare
and
swearing
at
her
unceasingly
now
but
she
had
spurted
once
and
appeared
to
be
incapable
of
again
increasing
her
speed
in
this
way
they
went
on
for
some
little
distance
harry
using
his
whip
brutally
the
mare
desperately
struggling
to
attain
a
greater
pace
reilly
hanging
on
with
tenacity
to
her
hind
flanks
and
giving
up
not
an
inch
of
ground
a
mile
is
indeed
a
very
short
distance
when
traversed
at
such
a
pace
the
finishing
flag
was
already
but
a
few
hundred
feet
further
on
reilly
realized
that
it
was
time
now
to
go
to
the
front
he
gritted
his
teeth
together
with
determination
and
bent
his
head
down
even
further
toward
his
front
wheel
then
his
feet
began
to
move
so
quickly
that
there
was
only
visible
an
indistinct
blur
at
the
sides
of
his
crank
shaft
at
this
very
second
with
a
face
marked
with
rage
and
hatred
harry
brought
his
horse
suddenly
across
the
road
to
thet
part
of
it
which
he
had
been
warned
to
avoid
it
is
hard
to
tell
what
kept
reilly
from
being
run
into
and
trampled
under
foot
an
attempt
at
back
pedaling
a
sudden
twist
of
the
handle-bar
a
lurch
to
one
side
that
almost
threw
him
from
his
seat
then
in
the
fraction
of
a
second
he
was
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
pushing
ahead
of
the
mare
almost
as
though
she
were
standing
still
the
outburst
of
alarm
from
the
throats
of
the
soldiers
changed
when
they
saw
that
reilly
had
not
been
injured
first
into
a
shout
of
indignation
at
the
dastardly
attempt
which
had
been
made
to
run
him
down
and
then
into
a
roar
of
delight
when
the
bicyclist
breasted
the
flag
a
winner
of
the
race
by
twenty
feet
as
he
crossed
the
line
reilly
caught
a
glimpse
of
washington
he
stood
close
to
the
flag
and
was
waving
his
hat
in
the
air
with
the
enthusiasm
of
a
schoolboy
reilly
went
on
down
the
road
slackening
his
speed
as
effectively
as
he
could
but
before
it
was
possible
to
entirely
stop
his
wheelâ€™s
momentum
the
noisy
acclamations
in
his
rear
ceased
with
startling
suddenness
he
turned
in
his
saddle
and
looked
back
as
sure
as
st
peter
he
had
the
road
entirely
to
himself
there
wasnâ€™t
a
soldier
or
the
ghost
of
a
soldier
in
sight
as
soon
as
he
could
he
turned
his
bicycle
about
and
rode
slowly
back
along
the
highway
now
so
singularly
deserted
looking
hither
and
thither
in
vain
for
some
trace
of
the
vanished
army
even
the
flag
which
had
been
stuck
into
the
ground
at
the
end
of
the
one-mile
race
course
was
gone
the
breeze
had
died
out
again
and
the
air
was
tranquil
and
warm
in
the
branches
of
a
nearby
tree
two
sparrows
chirped
and
twittered
peacefully
reilly
went
back
to
the
place
where
the
camp
had
been
he
found
there
only
open
fields
on
one
side
of
the
road
and
a
clump
of
woodland
on
the
other
he
continued
on
down
the
little
hill
up
which
harry
and
his
companions
had
brought
him
a
few
hours
previously
and
followed
the
road
on
further
coming
finally
to
the
fork
in
it
near
which
was
located
the
old
farmhouse
wherein
he
had
been
taken
captive
the
house
was
as
it
had
been
when
he
had
previously
entered
it
falling
apart
from
age
and
neglect
when
he
went
inside
he
found
lying
on
the
brick
hearth
in
front
of
the
fireplace
a
number
of
pieces
of
broken
glass
the
end
