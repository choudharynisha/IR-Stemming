i
one
sunny
afternoon
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
1861
a
soldier
lay
in
a
clump
of
laurel
by
the
side
of
a
road
in
western
virginia
he
lay
at
full
length
upon
his
stomach
his
feet
resting
upon
the
toes
his
head
upon
the
left
forearm
his
extended
right
hand
loosely
grasped
his
rifle
but
for
the
somewhat
methodical
disposition
of
his
limbs
and
a
slight
rhythmic
movement
of
the
cartridge-box
at
the
back
of
his
belt
he
might
have
been
thought
to
be
dead
he
was
asleep
at
his
post
of
duty
but
if
detected
he
would
be
dead
shortly
afterward
death
being
the
just
and
legal
penalty
of
his
crime
the
clump
of
laurel
in
which
the
criminal
lay
was
in
the
angle
of
a
road
which
after
ascending
southward
a
steep
acclivity
to
that
point
turned
sharply
to
the
west
running
along
the
summit
for
perhaps
one
hundred
yards
there
it
turned
southward
again
and
went
zigzagging
downward
through
the
forest
at
the
salient
of
that
second
angle
was
a
large
flat
rock
jutting
out
northward
overlooking
the
deep
valley
from
which
the
road
ascended
the
rock
capped
a
high
cliff
a
stone
dropped
from
its
outer
edge
would
have
fallen
sheer
downward
one
thousand
feet
to
the
tops
of
the
pines
the
angle
where
the
soldier
lay
was
on
another
spur
of
the
same
cliff
had
he
been
awake
he
would
have
commanded
a
view
not
only
of
the
short
arm
of
the
road
and
the
jutting
rock
but
of
the
entire
profile
of
the
cliff
below
it
it
might
well
have
made
him
giddy
to
look
the
country
was
wooded
everywhere
except
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
to
the
northward
where
there
was
a
small
natural
meadow
through
which
flowed
a
stream
scarcely
visible
from
the
valley's
rim
this
open
ground
looked
hardly
larger
than
an
ordinary
door-yard
but
was
really
several
acres
in
extent
its
green
was
more
vivid
than
that
of
the
inclosing
forest
away
beyond
it
rose
a
line
of
giant
cliffs
similar
to
those
upon
which
we
are
supposed
to
stand
in
our
survey
of
the
savage
scene
and
through
which
the
road
had
somehow
made
its
climb
to
the
summit
the
configuration
of
the
valley
indeed
was
such
that
from
this
point
of
observation
it
seemed
entirely
shut
in
and
one
could
but
have
wondered
how
the
road
which
found
a
way
out
of
it
had
found
a
way
into
it
and
whence
came
and
whither
went
the
waters
of
the
stream
that
parted
the
meadow
more
than
a
thousand
feet
below
no
country
is
so
wild
and
difficult
but
men
will
make
it
a
theatre
of
war
concealed
in
the
forest
at
the
bottom
of
that
military
rat-trap
in
which
half
a
hundred
men
in
possession
of
the
exits
might
have
starved
an
army
to
submission
lay
five
regiments
of
federal
infantry
they
had
marched
all
the
previous
day
and
night
and
were
resting
at
nightfall
they
would
take
to
the
road
again
climb
to
the
place
where
their
unfaithful
sentinel
now
slept
and
descending
the
other
slope
of
the
ridge
fall
upon
a
camp
of
the
enemy
at
about
midnight
their
hope
was
to
surprise
it
for
the
road
led
to
the
rear
of
it
in
case
of
failure
their
position
would
be
perilous
in
the
extreme
and
fail
they
surely
would
should
accident
or
vigilance
apprise
the
enemy
of
the
movement
ii
the
sleeping
sentinel
in
the
clump
of
laurel
was
a
young
virginian
named
carter
druse
he
was
the
son
of
wealthy
parents
an
only
child
and
had
known
such
ease
and
cultivation
and
high
living
as
wealth
and
taste
were
able
to
command
in
the
mountain
country
of
western
virginia
his
home
was
but
a
few
miles
from
where
he
now
lay
one
morning
he
had
risen
from
the
breakfast-table
and
said
quietly
but
gravely
father
a
union
regiment
has
arrived
at
grafton
i
am
going
to
join
it
the
father
lifted
his
leonine
head
looked
at
the
son
a
moment
in
silence
and
replied
well
go
sir
and
whatever
may
occur
do
what
you
conceive
to
be
your
duty
virginia
to
which
you
are
a
traitor
must
get
on
without
you
should
we
both
live
to
the
end
of
the
war
we
will
speak
further
of
the
matter
your
mother
as
the
physician
has
informed
you
is
in
a
most
critical
condition
at
the
best
she
cannot
be
with
us
longer
than
a
few
weeks
but
that
time
is
precious
it
would
be
better
not
to
disturb
her
so
carter
druse
bowing
reverently
to
his
father
who
returned
the
salute
with
a
stately
courtesy
that
masked
a
breaking
heart
left
the
home
of
his
childhood
to
go
soldiering
by
conscience
and
courage
by
deeds
of
devotion
and
daring
he
soon
commended
himself
to
his
fellows
and
his
officers
and
it
was
to
these
qualities
and
to
some
knowledge
of
the
country
that
he
owed
his
selection
for
his
present
perilous
duty
at
the
extreme
outpost
nevertheless
fatigue
had
been
stronger
than
resolution
and
he
had
fallen
asleep
what
good
or
bad
angel
came
in
a
dream
to
rouse
him
from
his
state
of
crime
who
shall
say
without
a
movement
without
a
sound
in
the
profound
silence
and
the
languor
of
the
late
afternoon
some
invisible
messenger
of
fate
touched
with
unsealing
finger
the
eyes
of
his
consciousness--whispered
into
the
ear
of
his
spirit
the
mysterious
awakening
word
which
no
human
lips
ever
have
spoken
no
human
memory
ever
has
recalled
he
quietly
raised
his
forehead
from
his
arm
and
looked
between
the
masking
stems
of
the
laurels
instinctively
closing
his
right
hand
about
the
stock
of
his
rifle
his
first
feeling
was
a
keen
artistic
delight
on
a
colossal
pedestal
the
cliff--motionless
at
the
extreme
edge
of
the
capping
rock
and
sharply
outlined
against
the
sky--was
an
equestrian
statue
of
impressive
dignity
the
figure
of
the
man
sat
the
figure
of
the
horse
straight
and
soldierly
but
with
the
repose
of
a
grecian
god
carved
in
the
marble
which
limits
the
suggestion
of
activity
the
gray
costume
harmonized
with
its
aã«rial
background
the
metal
of
accoutrement
and
caparison
was
softened
and
subdued
by
the
shadow
the
animal's
skin
had
no
points
of
high
light
a
carbine
strikingly
foreshortened
lay
across
the
pommel
of
the
saddle
kept
in
place
by
the
right
hand
grasping
it
at
the
grip
the
left
hand
holding
the
bridle
rein
was
invisible
in
silhouette
against
the
sky
the
profile
of
the
horse
was
cut
with
the
sharpness
of
a
cameo
it
looked
across
the
heights
of
air
to
the
confronting
cliffs
beyond
the
face
of
the
rider
turned
slightly
away
showed
only
an
outline
of
temple
and
beard
he
was
looking
downward
to
the
bottom
of
the
valley
magnified
by
its
lift
against
the
sky
and
by
the
soldier's
testifying
sense
of
the
formidableness
of
a
near
enemy
the
group
appeared
of
heroic
almost
colossal
size
for
an
instant
druse
had
a
strange
half-defined
feeling
that
he
had
slept
to
the
end
of
the
war
and
was
looking
upon
a
noble
work
of
art
reared
upon
that
eminence
to
commemorate
the
deeds
of
an
heroic
past
of
which
he
had
been
an
inglorious
part
the
feeling
was
dispelled
by
a
slight
movement
of
the
group
the
horse
without
moving
its
feet
had
drawn
its
body
slightly
backward
from
the
verge
the
man
remained
immobile
as
before
broad
awake
and
keenly
alive
to
the
significance
of
the
situation
druse
now
brought
the
butt
of
his
rifle
against
his
cheek
by
cautiously
pushing
the
barrel
forward
through
the
bushes
cocked
the
piece
and
glancing
through
the
sights
covered
a
vital
spot
of
the
horseman's
breast
a
touch
upon
the
trigger
and
all
would
have
been
well
with
carter
druse
at
that
instant
the
horseman
turned
his
head
and
looked
in
the
direction
of
his
concealed
foeman--seemed
to
look
into
his
very
face
into
his
eyes
into
his
brave
compassionate
heart
is
it
then
so
terrible
to
kill
an
enemy
in
war--an
enemy
who
has
surprised
a
secret
vital
to
the
safety
of
one's
self
and
comrades--an
enemy
more
formidable
for
his
knowledge
than
all
his
army
for
its
numbers
carter
druse
grew
pale
he
shook
in
every
limb
turned
faint
and
saw
the
statuesque
group
before
him
as
black
figures
rising
falling
moving
unsteadily
in
arcs
of
circles
in
a
fiery
sky
his
hand
fell
away
from
his
weapon
his
head
slowly
dropped
until
his
face
rested
on
the
leaves
in
which
he
lay
this
courageous
gentleman
and
hardy
soldier
was
near
swooning
from
intensity
of
emotion
it
was
not
for
long
in
another
moment
his
face
was
raised
from
earth
his
hands
resumed
their
places
on
the
rifle
his
forefinger
sought
the
trigger
mind
heart
and
eyes
were
clear
conscience
and
reason
sound
he
could
not
hope
to
capture
that
enemy
to
alarm
him
would
but
send
him
dashing
to
his
camp
with
his
fatal
news
the
duty
of
the
soldier
was
plain
the
man
must
be
shot
dead
from
ambush--without
warning
without
a
moment's
spiritual
preparation
with
never
so
much
as
an
unspoken
prayer
he
must
be
sent
to
his
account
but
no--there
is
a
hope
he
may
have
discovered
nothing--perhaps
he
is
but
admiring
the
sublimity
of
the
landscape
if
permitted
he
may
turn
and
ride
carelessly
away
in
the
direction
whence
he
came
surely
it
will
be
possible
to
judge
at
the
instant
of
his
withdrawing
whether
he
knows
it
may
well
be
that
his
fixity
of
attention--druse
turned
his
head
and
looked
through
the
deeps
of
air
downward
as
from
the
surface
to
the
bottom
of
a
translucent
sea
he
saw
creeping
across
the
green
meadow
a
sinuous
line
of
figures
of
men
and
horses--some
foolish
commander
was
permitting
the
soldiers
of
his
escort
to
water
their
beasts
in
the
open
in
plain
view
from
a
dozen
summits
druse
withdrew
his
eyes
from
the
valley
and
fixed
them
again
upon
the
group
of
man
and
horse
in
the
sky
and
again
it
was
through
the
sights
of
his
rifle
but
this
time
his
aim
was
at
the
horse
in
his
memory
as
if
they
were
a
divine
mandate
rang
the
words
of
his
father
at
their
parting
whatever
may
occur
do
what
you
conceive
to
be
your
duty
he
was
calm
now
his
teeth
were
firmly
but
not
rigidly
closed
his
nerves
were
as
tranquil
as
a
sleeping
babe's--not
a
tremor
affected
any
muscle
of
his
body
his
breathing
until
suspended
in
the
act
of
taking
aim
was
regular
and
slow
duty
had
conquered
the
spirit
had
said
to
the
body
peace
be
still
he
fired
iii
an
officer
of
the
federal
force
who
in
a
spirit
of
adventure
or
in
quest
of
knowledge
had
left
the
hidden
bivouac
in
the
valley
and
with
aimless
feet
had
made
his
way
to
the
lower
edge
of
a
small
open
space
near
the
foot
of
the
cliff
was
considering
what
he
had
to
gain
by
pushing
his
exploration
further
at
a
distance
of
a
quarter-mile
before
him
but
apparently
at
a
stone's
throw
rose
from
its
fringe
of
pines
the
gigantic
face
of
rock
towering
to
so
great
a
height
above
him
that
it
made
him
giddy
to
look
up
to
where
its
edge
cut
a
sharp
rugged
line
against
the
sky
it
presented
a
clean
vertical
profile
against
a
background
of
blue
sky
to
a
point
half
the
way
down
and
of
distant
hills
hardly
less
blue
thence
to
the
tops
of
the
trees
at
its
base
lifting
his
eyes
to
the
dizzy
altitude
of
its
summit
the
officer
saw
an
astonishing
sight--a
man
on
horseback
riding
down
into
the
valley
through
the
air
straight
upright
sat
the
rider
in
military
fashion
with
a
firm
seat
in
the
saddle
a
strong
clutch
upon
the
rein
to
hold
his
charger
from
too
impetuous
a
plunge
from
his
bare
head
his
long
hair
streamed
upward
waving
like
a
plume
his
hands
were
concealed
in
the
cloud
of
the
horse's
lifted
mane
the
animal's
body
was
as
level
as
if
every
hoof-stroke
encountered
the
resistant
earth
its
motions
were
those
of
a
wild
gallop
but
even
as
the
officer
looked
they
ceased
with
all
the
legs
thrown
sharply
forward
as
in
the
act
of
alighting
from
a
leap
but
this
was
a
flight
filled
with
amazement
and
terror
by
this
apparition
of
a
horseman
in
the
sky--half
believing
himself
the
chosen
scribe
of
some
new
apocalypse
the
officer
was
overcome
by
the
intensity
of
his
emotions
his
legs
failed
him
and
he
fell
almost
at
the
same
instant
he
heard
a
crashing
sound
in
the
trees--a
sound
that
died
without
an
echo--and
all
was
still
the
officer
rose
to
his
feet
trembling
the
familiar
sensation
of
an
abraded
shin
recalled
his
dazed
faculties
pulling
himself
together
he
ran
rapidly
obliquely
away
from
the
cliff
to
a
point
distant
from
its
foot
thereabout
he
expected
to
find
his
man
and
thereabout
he
naturally
failed
in
the
fleeting
instant
of
his
vision
his
imagination
had
been
so
wrought
upon
by
the
apparent
grace
and
ease
and
intention
of
the
marvelous
performance
that
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
the
line
of
march
of
aã«rial
cavalry
is
directly
downward
and
that
he
could
find
the
objects
of
his
search
at
the
very
foot
of
the
cliff
a
half-hour
later
he
returned
to
camp
this
officer
was
a
wise
man
he
knew
better
than
to
tell
an
incredible
truth
he
said
nothing
of
what
he
had
seen
but
when
the
commander
asked
him
if
in
his
scout
he
had
learned
anything
of
advantage
to
the
expedition
he
answered
yes
sir
there
is
no
road
leading
down
into
this
valley
from
the
southward
the
commander
knowing
better
smiled
iv
after
firing
his
shot
private
carter
druse
reloaded
his
rifle
and
resumed
his
watch
ten
minutes
had
hardly
passed
when
a
federal
sergeant
crept
cautiously
to
him
on
hands
and
knees
druse
neither
turned
his
head
nor
looked
at
him
but
lay
without
motion
or
sign
of
recognition
did
you
fire
the
sergeant
whispered
yes
at
what
a
horse
it
was
standing
on
yonder
rock--pretty
far
out
you
see
it
is
no
longer
there
it
went
over
the
cliff
the
man's
face
was
white
but
he
showed
no
other
sign
of
emotion
having
answered
he
turned
away
his
eyes
and
said
no
more
the
sergeant
did
not
understand
see
here
druse
he
said
after
a
moment's
silence
it's
no
use
making
a
mystery
i
order
you
to
report
was
there
anybody
on
the
horse
yes
well
my
father
the
sergeant
rose
to
his
feet
and
walked
away
good
god
he
said
an
occurrence
at
owl
creek
bridge
i
a
man
stood
upon
a
railroad
bridge
in
northern
alabama
looking
down
into
the
swift
water
twenty
feet
below
the
man's
hands
were
behind
his
back
the
wrists
bound
with
a
cord
a
rope
closely
encircled
his
neck
it
was
attached
to
a
stout
cross-timber
above
his
head
and
the
slack
fell
to
the
level
of
his
knees
some
loose
boards
laid
upon
the
sleepers
supporting
the
metals
of
the
railway
supplied
a
footing
for
him
and
his
executioners--two
private
soldiers
of
the
federal
army
directed
by
a
sergeant
who
in
civil
life
may
have
been
a
deputy
sheriff
at
a
short
remove
upon
the
same
temporary
platform
was
an
officer
in
the
uniform
of
his
rank
armed
he
was
a
captain
a
sentinel
at
each
end
of
the
bridge
stood
with
his
rifle
in
the
position
known
as
support
that
is
to
say
vertical
in
front
of
the
left
shoulder
the
hammer
resting
on
the
forearm
thrown
straight
across
the
chest--a
formal
and
unnatural
position
enforcing
an
erect
carriage
of
the
body
it
did
not
appear
to
be
the
duty
of
these
two
men
to
know
what
was
occurring
at
the
centre
of
the
bridge
they
merely
blockaded
the
two
ends
of
the
foot
planking
that
traversed
it
beyond
one
of
the
sentinels
nobody
was
in
sight
the
railroad
ran
straight
away
into
a
forest
for
a
hundred
yards
then
curving
was
lost
to
view
doubtless
there
was
an
outpost
farther
along
the
other
bank
of
the
stream
was
open
ground--a
gentle
acclivity
topped
with
a
stockade
of
vertical
tree
trunks
loop-holed
for
rifles
with
a
single
embrasure
through
which
protruded
the
muzzle
of
a
brass
cannon
commanding
the
bridge
mid-way
of
the
slope
between
bridge
and
fort
were
the
spectators--a
single
company
of
infantry
in
line
at
parade
rest
the
butts
of
the
rifles
on
the
ground
the
barrels
inclining
slightly
backward
against
the
right
shoulder
the
hands
crossed
upon
the
stock
a
lieutenant
stood
at
the
right
of
the
line
the
point
of
his
sword
upon
the
ground
his
left
hand
resting
upon
his
right
excepting
the
group
of
four
at
the
centre
of
the
bridge
not
a
man
moved
the
company
faced
the
bridge
staring
stonily
motionless
the
sentinels
facing
the
banks
of
the
stream
might
have
been
statues
to
adorn
the
bridge
the
captain
stood
with
folded
arms
silent
observing
the
work
of
his
subordinates
but
making
no
sign
death
is
a
dignitary
who
when
he
comes
announced
is
to
be
received
with
formal
manifestations
of
respect
even
by
those
most
familiar
with
him
in
the
code
of
military
etiquette
silence
and
fixity
are
forms
of
deference
the
man
who
was
engaged
in
being
hanged
was
apparently
about
thirty-five
years
of
age
he
was
a
civilian
if
one
might
judge
from
his
habit
which
was
that
of
a
planter
his
features
were
good--a
straight
nose
firm
mouth
broad
forehead
from
which
his
long
dark
hair
was
combed
straight
back
falling
behind
his
ears
to
the
collar
of
his
well-fitting
frock-coat
he
wore
a
mustache
and
pointed
beard
but
no
whiskers
his
eyes
were
large
and
dark
gray
and
had
a
kindly
expression
which
one
would
hardly
have
expected
in
one
whose
neck
was
in
the
hemp
evidently
this
was
no
vulgar
assassin
the
liberal
military
code
makes
provision
for
hanging
many
kinds
of
persons
and
gentlemen
are
not
excluded
the
preparations
being
complete
the
two
private
soldiers
stepped
aside
and
each
drew
away
the
plank
upon
which
he
had
been
standing
the
sergeant
turned
to
the
captain
saluted
and
placed
himself
immediately
behind
that
officer
who
in
turn
moved
apart
one
pace
these
movements
left
the
condemned
man
and
the
sergeant
standing
on
the
two
ends
of
the
same
plank
which
spanned
three
of
the
cross-ties
of
the
bridge
the
end
upon
which
the
civilian
stood
almost
but
not
quite
reached
a
fourth
this
plank
had
been
held
in
place
by
the
weight
of
the
captain
it
was
now
held
by
that
of
the
sergeant
at
a
signal
from
the
former
the
latter
would
step
aside
the
plank
would
tilt
and
the
condemned
man
go
down
between
two
ties
the
arrangement
commended
itself
to
his
judgment
as
simple
and
effective
his
face
had
not
been
covered
nor
his
eyes
bandaged
he
looked
a
moment
at
his
unsteadfast
footing
then
let
his
gaze
wander
to
the
swirling
water
of
the
stream
racing
madly
beneath
his
feet
a
piece
of
dancing
driftwood
caught
his
attention
and
his
eyes
followed
it
down
the
current
how
slowly
it
appeared
to
move
what
a
sluggish
stream
he
closed
his
eyes
in
order
to
fix
his
last
thoughts
upon
his
wife
and
children
the
water
touched
to
gold
by
the
early
sun
the
brooding
mists
under
the
banks
at
some
distance
down
the
stream
the
fort
the
soldiers
the
piece
of
drift--all
had
distracted
him
and
now
he
became
conscious
of
a
new
disturbance
striking
through
the
thought
of
his
dear
ones
was
a
sound
which
he
could
neither
ignore
nor
understand
a
sharp
distinct
metallic
percussion
like
the
stroke
of
a
blacksmith's
hammer
upon
the
anvil
it
had
the
same
ringing
quality
he
wondered
what
it
was
and
whether
immeasurably
distant
or
near
by--it
seemed
both
its
recurrence
was
regular
but
as
slow
as
the
tolling
of
a
death
knell
he
awaited
each
stroke
with
impatience
and--he
knew
not
why--apprehension
the
intervals
of
silence
grew
progressively
longer
the
delays
became
maddening
with
their
greater
infrequency
the
sounds
increased
in
strength
and
sharpness
they
hurt
his
ear
like
the
thrust
of
a
knife
he
feared
he
would
shriek
what
he
heard
was
the
ticking
of
his
watch
he
unclosed
his
eyes
and
saw
again
the
water
below
him
if
i
could
free
my
hands
he
thought
i
might
throw
off
the
noose
and
spring
into
the
stream
by
diving
i
could
evade
the
bullets
and
swimming
vigorously
reach
the
bank
take
to
the
woods
and
get
away
home
my
home
thank
god
is
as
yet
outside
their
lines
my
wife
and
little
ones
are
still
beyond
the
invader's
farthest
advance
as
these
thoughts
which
have
here
to
be
set
down
in
words
were
flashed
into
the
doomed
man's
brain
rather
than
evolved
from
it
the
captain
nodded
to
the
sergeant
the
sergeant
stepped
aside
ii
peyton
farquhar
was
a
well-to-do
planter
of
an
old
and
highly
respected
alabama
family
being
a
slave
owner
and
like
other
slave
owners
a
politician
he
was
naturally
an
original
secessionist
and
ardently
devoted
to
the
southern
cause
circumstances
of
an
imperious
nature
which
it
is
unnecessary
to
relate
here
had
prevented
him
from
taking
service
with
the
gallant
army
that
had
fought
the
disastrous
campaigns
ending
with
the
fall
of
corinth
and
he
chafed
under
the
inglorious
restraint
longing
for
the
release
of
his
energies
the
larger
life
of
the
soldier
the
opportunity
for
distinction
that
opportunity
he
felt
would
come
as
it
comes
to
all
in
war
time
meanwhile
he
did
what
he
could
no
service
was
too
humble
for
him
to
perform
in
aid
of
the
south
no
adventure
too
perilous
for
him
to
undertake
if
consistent
with
the
character
of
a
civilian
who
was
at
heart
a
soldier
and
who
in
good
faith
and
without
too
much
qualification
assented
to
at
least
a
part
of
the
frankly
villainous
dictum
that
all
is
fair
in
love
and
war
one
evening
while
farquhar
and
his
wife
were
sitting
on
a
rustic
bench
near
the
entrance
to
his
grounds
a
gray-clad
soldier
rode
up
to
the
gate
and
asked
for
a
drink
of
water
mrs
farquhar
was
only
too
happy
to
serve
him
with
her
own
white
hands
while
she
was
fetching
the
water
her
husband
approached
the
dusty
horseman
and
inquired
eagerly
for
news
from
the
front
the
yanks
are
repairing
the
railroads
said
the
man
and
are
getting
ready
for
another
advance
they
have
reached
the
owl
creek
bridge
put
it
in
order
and
built
a
stockade
on
the
north
bank
the
commandant
has
issued
an
order
which
is
posted
everywhere
declaring
that
any
civilian
caught
interfering
with
the
railroad
its
bridges
tunnels
or
trains
will
be
summarily
hanged
i
saw
the
order
how
far
is
it
to
the
owl
creek
bridge
farquhar
asked
about
thirty
miles
is
there
no
force
on
this
side
the
creek
only
a
picket
post
half
a
mile
out
on
the
railroad
and
a
single
sentinel
at
this
end
of
the
bridge
suppose
a
man--a
civilian
and
student
of
hanging--should
elude
the
picket
post
and
perhaps
get
the
better
of
the
sentinel
said
farquhar
smiling
what
could
he
accomplish
the
soldier
reflected
i
was
there
a
month
ago
he
replied
i
observed
that
the
flood
of
last
winter
had
lodged
a
great
quantity
of
driftwood
against
the
wooden
pier
at
this
end
of
the
bridge
it
is
now
dry
and
would
burn
like
tow
the
lady
had
now
brought
the
water
which
the
soldier
drank
he
thanked
her
ceremoniously
bowed
to
her
husband
and
rode
away
an
hour
later
after
nightfall
he
repassed
the
plantation
going
northward
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come
he
was
a
federal
scout
iii
as
peyton
farquhar
fell
straight
downward
through
the
bridge
he
lost
consciousness
and
was
as
one
already
dead
from
this
state
he
was
awakened--ages
later
it
seemed
to
him--by
the
pain
of
a
sharp
pressure
upon
his
throat
followed
by
a
sense
of
suffocation
keen
poignant
agonies
seemed
to
shoot
from
his
neck
downward
through
every
fibre
of
his
body
and
limbs
these
pains
appeared
to
flash
along
well-defined
lines
of
ramification
and
to
beat
with
an
inconceivably
rapid
periodicity
they
seemed
like
streams
of
pulsating
fire
heating
him
to
an
intolerable
temperature
as
to
his
head
he
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
a
feeling
of
fulness--of
congestion
these
sensations
were
unaccompanied
by
thought
the
intellectual
part
of
his
nature
was
already
effaced
he
had
power
only
to
feel
and
feeling
was
torment
he
was
conscious
of
motion
encompassed
in
a
luminous
cloud
of
which
he
was
now
merely
the
fiery
heart
without
material
substance
he
swung
through
unthinkable
arcs
of
oscillation
like
a
vast
pendulum
then
all
at
once
with
terrible
suddenness
the
light
about
him
shot
upward
with
the
noise
of
a
loud
plash
a
frightful
roaring
was
in
his
ears
and
all
was
cold
and
dark
the
power
of
thought
was
restored
he
knew
that
the
rope
had
broken
and
he
had
fallen
into
the
stream
there
was
no
additional
strangulation
the
noose
about
his
neck
was
already
suffocating
him
and
kept
the
water
from
his
lungs
to
die
of
hanging
at
the
bottom
of
a
river--the
idea
seemed
to
him
ludicrous
he
opened
his
eyes
in
the
darkness
and
saw
above
him
a
gleam
of
light
but
how
distant
how
inaccessible
he
was
still
sinking
for
the
light
became
fainter
and
fainter
until
it
was
a
mere
glimmer
then
it
began
to
grow
and
brighten
and
he
knew
that
he
was
rising
toward
the
surface--knew
it
with
reluctance
for
he
was
now
very
comfortable
to
be
hanged
and
drowned
he
thought
that
is
not
so
bad
but
i
do
not
wish
to
be
shot
no
i
will
not
be
shot
that
is
not
fair
he
was
not
conscious
of
an
effort
but
a
sharp
pain
in
his
wrist
apprised
him
that
he
was
trying
to
free
his
hands
he
gave
the
struggle
his
attention
as
an
idler
might
observe
the
feat
of
a
juggler
without
interest
in
the
outcome
what
splendid
effort--what
magnificent
what
superhuman
strength
ah
that
was
a
fine
endeavor
bravo
the
cord
fell
away
his
arms
parted
and
floated
upward
the
hands
dimly
seen
on
each
side
in
the
growing
light
he
watched
them
with
a
new
interest
as
first
one
and
then
the
other
pounced
upon
the
noose
at
his
neck
they
tore
it
away
and
thrust
it
fiercely
aside
its
undulations
resembling
those
of
a
water-snake
put
it
back
put
it
back
he
thought
he
shouted
these
words
to
his
hands
for
the
undoing
of
the
noose
had
been
succeeded
by
the
direst
pang
that
he
had
yet
experienced
his
neck
ached
horribly
his
brain
was
on
fire
his
heart
which
had
been
fluttering
faintly
gave
a
great
leap
trying
to
force
itself
out
at
his
mouth
his
whole
body
was
racked
and
wrenched
with
an
insupportable
anguish
but
his
disobedient
hands
gave
no
heed
to
the
command
they
beat
the
water
vigorously
with
quick
downward
strokes
forcing
him
to
the
surface
he
felt
his
head
emerge
his
eyes
were
blinded
by
the
sunlight
his
chest
expanded
convulsively
and
with
a
supreme
and
crowning
agony
his
lungs
engulfed
a
great
draught
of
air
which
instantly
he
expelled
in
a
shriek
he
was
now
in
full
possession
of
his
physical
senses
they
were
indeed
preternaturally
keen
and
alert
something
in
the
awful
disturbance
of
his
organic
system
had
so
exalted
and
refined
them
that
they
made
record
of
things
never
before
perceived
he
felt
the
ripples
upon
his
face
and
heard
their
separate
sounds
as
they
struck
he
looked
at
the
forest
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
saw
the
individual
trees
the
leaves
and
the
veining
of
each
leaf--saw
the
very
insects
upon
them
the
locusts
the
brilliant-bodied
flies
the
gray
spiders
stretching
their
webs
from
twig
to
twig
he
noted
the
prismatic
colors
in
all
the
dewdrops
upon
a
million
blades
of
grass
the
humming
of
the
gnats
that
danced
above
the
eddies
of
the
stream
the
beating
of
the
dragon-flies'
wings
the
strokes
of
the
water-spiders'
legs
like
oars
which
had
lifted
their
boat--all
these
made
audible
music
a
fish
slid
along
beneath
his
eyes
and
he
heard
the
rush
of
its
body
parting
the
water
he
had
come
to
the
surface
facing
down
the
stream
in
a
moment
the
visible
world
seemed
to
wheel
slowly
round
himself
the
pivotal
point
and
he
saw
the
bridge
the
fort
the
soldiers
upon
the
bridge
the
captain
the
sergeant
the
two
privates
his
executioners
they
were
in
silhouette
against
the
blue
sky
they
shouted
and
gesticulated
pointing
at
him
the
captain
had
drawn
his
pistol
but
did
not
fire
the
others
were
unarmed
their
movements
were
grotesque
and
horrible
their
forms
gigantic
suddenly
he
heard
a
sharp
report
and
something
struck
the
water
smartly
within
a
few
inches
of
his
head
spattering
his
face
with
spray
he
heard
a
second
report
and
saw
one
of
the
sentinels
with
his
rifle
at
his
shoulder
a
light
cloud
of
blue
smoke
rising
from
the
muzzle
the
man
in
the
water
saw
the
eye
of
the
man
on
the
bridge
gazing
into
his
own
through
the
sights
of
the
rifle
he
observed
that
it
was
a
gray
eye
and
remembered
having
read
that
gray
eyes
were
keenest
and
that
all
famous
markmen
had
them
nevertheless
this
one
had
missed
a
counter-swirl
had
caught
farquhar
and
turned
him
half
round
he
was
again
looking
into
the
forest
on
the
bank
opposite
the
fort
the
sound
of
a
clear
high
voice
in
a
monotonous
singsong
now
rang
out
behind
him
and
came
across
the
water
with
a
distinctness
that
pierced
and
subdued
all
other
sounds
even
the
beating
of
the
ripples
in
his
ears
although
no
soldier
he
had
frequented
camps
enough
to
know
the
dread
significance
of
that
deliberate
drawling
aspirated
chant
the
lieutenant
on
shore
was
taking
a
part
in
the
morning's
work
how
coldly
and
pitilessly--with
what
an
even
calm
intonation
presaging
and
enforcing
tranquillity
in
the
men--with
what
accurately
measured
intervals
fell
those
cruel
words
attention
company
shoulder
arms
ready
aim
fire
farquhar
dived--dived
as
deeply
as
he
could
the
water
roared
in
his
ears
like
the
voice
of
niagara
yet
he
heard
the
dulled
thunder
of
the
volley
and
rising
again
toward
the
surface
met
shining
bits
of
metal
singularly
flattened
oscillating
slowly
downward
some
of
them
touched
him
on
the
face
and
hands
then
fell
away
continuing
their
descent
one
lodged
between
his
collar
and
neck
it
was
uncomfortably
warm
and
he
snatched
it
out
as
he
rose
to
the
surface
gasping
for
breath
he
saw
that
he
had
been
a
long
time
under
water
he
was
perceptibly
farther
down
stream--nearer
to
safety
the
soldiers
had
almost
finished
reloading
the
metal
ramrods
flashed
all
at
once
in
the
sunshine
as
they
were
drawn
from
the
barrels
turned
in
the
air
and
thrust
into
their
sockets
the
two
sentinels
fired
again
independently
and
ineffectually
the
hunted
man
saw
all
this
over
his
shoulder
he
was
now
swimming
vigorously
with
the
current
his
brain
was
as
energetic
as
his
arms
and
legs
he
thought
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
the
officer
he
reasoned
will
not
make
that
martinet's
error
a
second
time
it
is
as
easy
to
dodge
a
volley
as
a
single
shot
he
has
probably
already
given
the
command
to
fire
at
will
god
help
me
i
cannot
dodge
them
all
an
appalling
plash
within
two
yards
of
him
was
followed
by
a
loud
rushing
sound
diminuendo
which
seemed
to
travel
back
through
the
air
to
the
fort
and
died
in
an
explosion
which
stirred
the
very
river
to
its
deeps
a
rising
sheet
of
water
curved
over
him
fell
down
upon
him
blinded
him
strangled
him
the
cannon
had
taken
a
hand
in
the
game
as
he
shook
his
head
free
from
the
commotion
of
the
smitten
water
he
heard
the
deflected
shot
humming
through
the
air
ahead
and
in
an
instant
it
was
cracking
and
smashing
the
branches
in
the
forest
beyond
they
will
not
do
that
again
he
thought
the
next
time
they
will
use
a
charge
of
grape
i
must
keep
my
eye
upon
the
gun
the
smoke
will
apprise
me--the
report
arrives
too
late
it
lags
behind
the
missile
that
is
a
good
gun
suddenly
he
felt
himself
whirled
round
and
round--spinning
like
a
top
the
water
the
banks
the
forests
the
now
distant
bridge
fort
and
men
--all
were
commingled
and
blurred
objects
were
represented
by
their
colors
only
circular
horizontal
streaks
of
color--that
was
all
he
saw
he
had
been
caught
in
a
vortex
and
was
being
whirled
on
with
a
velocity
of
advance
and
gyration
that
made
him
giddy
and
sick
in
a
few
moments
he
was
flung
upon
the
gravel
at
the
foot
of
the
left
bank
of
the
stream
--the
southern
bank--and
behind
a
projecting
point
which
concealed
him
from
his
enemies
the
sudden
arrest
of
his
motion
the
abrasion
of
one
of
his
hands
on
the
gravel
restored
him
and
he
wept
with
delight
he
dug
his
fingers
into
the
sand
threw
it
over
himself
in
handfuls
and
audibly
blessed
it
it
looked
like
diamonds
rubies
emeralds
he
could
think
of
nothing
beautiful
which
it
did
not
resemble
the
trees
upon
the
bank
were
giant
garden
plants
he
noted
a
definite
order
in
their
arrangement
inhaled
the
fragrance
of
their
blooms
a
strange
roseate
light
shone
through
the
spaces
among
their
trunks
and
the
wind
made
in
their
branches
the
music
of
ã¦olian
harps
he
had
no
wish
to
perfect
his
escape--was
content
to
remain
in
that
enchanting
spot
until
retaken
a
whiz
and
rattle
of
grapeshot
among
the
branches
high
above
his
head
roused
him
from
his
dream
the
baffled
cannoneer
had
fired
him
a
random
farewell
he
sprang
to
his
feet
rushed
up
the
sloping
bank
and
plunged
into
the
forest
all
that
day
he
traveled
laying
his
course
by
the
rounding
sun
the
forest
seemed
interminable
nowhere
did
he
discover
a
break
in
it
not
even
a
woodman's
road
he
had
not
known
that
he
lived
in
so
wild
a
region
there
was
something
uncanny
in
the
revelation
by
nightfall
he
was
fatigued
footsore
famishing
the
thought
of
his
wife
and
children
urged
him
on
at
last
he
found
a
road
which
led
him
in
what
he
knew
to
be
the
right
direction
it
was
as
wide
and
straight
as
a
city
street
yet
it
seemed
untraveled
no
fields
bordered
it
no
dwelling
anywhere
not
so
much
as
the
barking
of
a
dog
suggested
human
habitation
the
black
bodies
of
the
trees
formed
a
straight
wall
on
both
sides
terminating
on
the
horizon
in
a
point
like
a
diagram
in
a
lesson
in
perspective
over-head
as
he
looked
up
through
this
rift
in
the
wood
shone
great
golden
stars
looking
unfamiliar
and
grouped
in
strange
constellations
he
was
sure
they
were
arranged
in
some
order
which
had
a
secret
and
malign
significance
the
wood
on
either
side
was
full
of
singular
noises
among
which--once
twice
and
again--he
distinctly
heard
whispers
in
an
unknown
tongue
his
neck
was
in
pain
and
lifting
his
hand
to
it
he
found
it
horribly
swollen
he
knew
that
it
had
a
circle
of
black
where
the
rope
had
bruised
it
his
eyes
felt
congested
he
could
no
longer
close
them
his
tongue
was
swollen
with
thirst
he
relieved
its
fever
by
thrusting
it
forward
from
between
his
teeth
into
the
cold
air
how
softly
the
turf
had
carpeted
the
untraveled
avenue--he
could
no
longer
feel
the
roadway
beneath
his
feet
doubtless
despite
his
suffering
he
had
fallen
asleep
while
walking
for
now
he
sees
another
scene--perhaps
he
has
merely
recovered
from
a
delirium
he
stands
at
the
gate
of
his
own
home
all
is
as
he
left
it
and
all
bright
and
beautiful
in
the
morning
sunshine
he
must
have
traveled
the
entire
night
as
he
pushes
open
the
gate
and
passes
up
the
wide
white
walk
he
sees
a
flutter
of
female
garments
his
wife
looking
fresh
and
cool
and
sweet
steps
down
from
the
veranda
to
meet
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
she
stands
waiting
with
a
smile
of
ineffable
joy
an
attitude
of
matchless
grace
and
dignity
ah
how
beautiful
she
is
he
springs
forward
with
extended
arms
as
he
is
about
to
clasp
her
he
feels
a
stunning
blow
upon
the
back
of
the
neck
a
blinding
white
light
blazes
all
about
him
with
a
sound
like
the
shock
of
a
cannon--then
all
is
darkness
and
silence
peyton
farquhar
was
dead
his
body
with
a
broken
neck
swung
gently
from
side
to
side
beneath
the
timbers
of
the
owl
creek
bridge
chickamauga
one
sunny
autumn
afternoon
a
child
strayed
away
from
its
rude
home
in
a
small
field
and
entered
a
forest
unobserved
it
was
happy
in
a
new
sense
of
freedom
from
control
happy
in
the
opportunity
of
exploration
and
adventure
for
this
child's
spirit
in
bodies
of
its
ancestors
had
for
thousands
of
years
been
trained
to
memorable
feats
of
discovery
and
conquest--victories
in
battles
whose
critical
moments
were
centuries
whose
victors'
camps
were
cities
of
hewn
stone
from
the
cradle
of
its
race
it
had
conquered
its
way
through
two
continents
and
passing
a
great
sea
had
penetrated
a
third
there
to
be
born
to
war
and
dominion
as
a
heritage
the
child
was
a
boy
aged
about
six
years
the
son
of
a
poor
planter
in
his
younger
manhood
the
father
had
been
a
soldier
had
fought
against
naked
savages
and
followed
the
flag
of
his
country
into
the
capital
of
a
civilized
race
to
the
far
south
in
the
peaceful
life
of
a
planter
the
warrior-fire
survived
once
kindled
it
is
never
extinguished
the
man
loved
military
books
and
pictures
and
the
boy
had
understood
enough
to
make
himself
a
wooden
sword
though
even
the
eye
of
his
father
would
hardly
have
known
it
for
what
it
was
this
weapon
he
now
bore
bravely
as
became
the
son
of
an
heroic
race
and
pausing
now
and
again
in
the
sunny
space
of
the
forest
assumed
with
some
exaggeration
the
postures
of
aggression
and
defense
that
he
had
been
taught
by
the
engraver's
art
made
reckless
by
the
ease
with
which
he
overcame
invisible
foes
attempting
to
stay
his
advance
he
committed
the
common
enough
military
error
of
pushing
the
pursuit
to
a
dangerous
extreme
until
he
found
himself
upon
the
margin
of
a
wide
but
shallow
brook
whose
rapid
waters
barred
his
direct
advance
against
the
flying
foe
that
had
crossed
with
illogical
ease
but
the
intrepid
victor
was
not
to
be
baffled
the
spirit
of
the
race
which
had
passed
the
great
sea
burned
unconquerable
in
that
small
breast
and
would
not
be
denied
finding
a
place
where
some
bowlders
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
lay
but
a
step
or
a
leap
apart
he
made
his
way
across
and
fell
again
upon
the
rear-guard
of
his
imaginary
foe
putting
all
to
the
sword
now
that
the
battle
had
been
won
prudence
required
that
he
withdraw
to
his
base
of
operations
alas
like
many
a
mightier
conqueror
and
like
one
the
mightiest
he
could
not
curb
the
lust
for
war
nor
learn
that
tempted
fate
will
leave
the
loftiest
star
advancing
from
the
bank
of
the
creek
he
suddenly
found
himself
confronted
with
a
new
and
more
formidable
enemy
in
the
path
that
he
was
following
sat
bolt
upright
with
ears
erect
and
paws
suspended
before
it
a
rabbit
with
a
startled
cry
the
child
turned
and
fled
he
knew
not
in
what
direction
calling
with
inarticulate
cries
for
his
mother
weeping
stumbling
his
tender
skin
cruelly
torn
by
brambles
his
little
heart
beating
hard
with
terror--breathless
blind
with
tears--lost
in
the
forest
then
for
more
than
an
hour
he
wandered
with
erring
feet
through
the
tangled
undergrowth
till
at
last
overcome
by
fatigue
he
lay
down
in
a
narrow
space
between
two
rocks
within
a
few
yards
of
the
stream
and
still
grasping
his
toy
sword
no
longer
a
weapon
but
a
companion
sobbed
himself
to
sleep
the
wood
birds
sang
merrily
above
his
head
the
squirrels
whisking
their
bravery
of
tail
ran
barking
from
tree
to
tree
unconscious
of
the
pity
of
it
and
somewhere
far
away
was
a
strange
muffled
thunder
as
if
the
partridges
were
drumming
in
celebration
of
nature's
victory
over
the
son
of
her
immemorial
enslavers
and
back
at
the
little
plantation
where
white
men
and
black
were
hastily
searching
the
fields
and
hedges
in
alarm
a
mother's
heart
was
breaking
for
her
missing
child
hours
passed
and
then
the
little
sleeper
rose
to
his
feet
the
chill
of
the
evening
was
in
his
limbs
the
fear
of
the
gloom
in
his
heart
but
he
had
rested
and
he
no
longer
wept
with
some
blind
instinct
which
impelled
to
action
he
struggled
through
the
undergrowth
about
him
and
came
to
a
more
open
ground--on
his
right
the
brook
to
the
left
a
gentle
acclivity
studded
with
infrequent
trees
over
all
the
gathering
gloom
of
twilight
a
thin
ghostly
mist
rose
along
the
water
it
frightened
and
repelled
him
instead
of
recrossing
in
the
direction
whence
he
had
come
he
turned
his
back
upon
it
and
went
forward
toward
the
dark
inclosing
wood
suddenly
he
saw
before
him
a
strange
moving
object
which
he
took
to
be
some
large
animal--a
dog
a
pig--he
could
not
name
it
perhaps
it
was
a
bear
he
had
seen
pictures
of
bears
but
knew
of
nothing
to
their
discredit
and
had
vaguely
wished
to
meet
one
but
something
in
form
or
movement
of
this
object--something
in
the
awkwardness
of
its
approach--told
him
that
it
was
not
a
bear
and
curiosity
was
stayed
by
fear
he
stood
still
and
as
it
came
slowly
on
gained
courage
every
moment
for
he
saw
that
at
least
it
had
not
the
long
menacing
ears
of
the
rabbit
possibly
his
impressionable
mind
was
half
conscious
of
something
familiar
in
its
shambling
awkward
gait
before
it
had
approached
near
enough
to
resolve
his
doubts
he
saw
that
it
was
followed
by
another
and
another
to
right
and
to
left
were
many
more
the
whole
open
space
about
him
was
alive
with
them--all
moving
toward
the
brook
they
were
men
they
crept
upon
their
hands
and
knees
they
used
their
hands
only
dragging
their
legs
they
used
their
knees
only
their
arms
hanging
idle
at
their
sides
they
strove
to
rise
to
their
feet
but
fell
prone
in
the
attempt
they
did
nothing
naturally
and
nothing
alike
save
only
to
advance
foot
by
foot
in
the
same
direction
singly
in
pairs
and
in
little
groups
they
came
on
through
the
gloom
some
halting
now
and
again
while
others
crept
slowly
past
them
then
resuming
their
movement
they
came
by
dozens
and
by
hundreds
as
far
on
either
hand
as
one
could
see
in
the
deepening
gloom
they
extended
and
the
black
wood
behind
them
appeared
to
be
inexhaustible
the
very
ground
seemed
in
motion
toward
the
creek
occasionally
one
who
had
paused
did
not
again
go
on
but
lay
motionless
he
was
dead
some
pausing
made
strange
gestures
with
their
hands
erected
their
arms
and
lowered
them
again
clasped
their
heads
spread
their
palms
upward
as
men
are
sometimes
seen
to
do
in
public
prayer
not
all
of
this
did
the
child
note
it
is
what
would
have
been
noted
by
an
elder
observer
he
saw
little
but
that
these
were
men
yet
crept
like
babes
being
men
they
were
not
terrible
though
unfamiliarly
clad
he
moved
among
them
freely
going
from
one
to
another
and
peering
into
their
faces
with
childish
curiosity
all
their
faces
were
singularly
white
and
many
were
streaked
and
gouted
with
red
something
in
this--
something
too
perhaps
in
their
grotesque
attitudes
and
movements--
reminded
him
of
the
painted
clown
whom
he
had
seen
last
summer
in
the
circus
and
he
laughed
as
he
watched
them
but
on
and
ever
on
they
crept
these
maimed
and
bleeding
men
as
heedless
as
he
of
the
dramatic
contrast
between
his
laughter
and
their
own
ghastly
gravity
to
him
it
was
a
merry
spectacle
he
had
seen
his
father's
negroes
creep
upon
their
hands
and
knees
for
his
amusement--had
ridden
them
so
making
believe
they
were
his
horses
he
now
approached
one
of
these
crawling
figures
from
behind
and
with
an
agile
movement
mounted
it
astride
the
man
sank
upon
his
breast
recovered
flung
the
small
boy
fiercely
to
the
ground
as
an
unbroken
colt
might
have
done
then
turned
upon
him
a
face
that
lacked
a
lower
jaw--from
the
upper
teeth
to
the
throat
was
a
great
red
gap
fringed
with
hanging
shreds
of
flesh
and
splinters
of
bone
the
unnatural
prominence
of
nose
the
absence
of
chin
the
fierce
eyes
gave
this
man
the
appearance
of
a
great
bird
of
prey
crimsoned
in
throat
and
breast
by
the
blood
of
its
quarry
the
man
rose
to
his
knees
the
child
to
his
feet
the
man
shook
his
fist
at
the
child
the
child
terrified
at
last
ran
to
a
tree
near
by
got
upon
the
farther
side
of
it
and
took
a
more
serious
view
of
the
situation
and
so
the
clumsy
multitude
dragged
itself
slowly
and
painfully
along
in
hideous
pantomime--moved
forward
down
the
slope
like
a
swarm
of
great
black
beetles
with
never
a
sound
of
going--in
silence
profound
absolute
instead
of
darkening
the
haunted
landscape
began
to
brighten
through
the
belt
of
trees
beyond
the
brook
shone
a
strange
red
light
the
trunks
and
branches
of
the
trees
making
a
black
lacework
against
it
it
struck
the
creeping
figures
and
gave
them
monstrous
shadows
which
caricatured
their
movements
on
the
lit
grass
it
fell
upon
their
faces
touching
their
whiteness
with
a
ruddy
tinge
accentuating
the
stains
with
which
so
many
of
them
were
freaked
and
maculated
it
sparkled
on
buttons
and
bits
of
metal
in
their
clothing
instinctively
the
child
turned
toward
the
growing
splendor
and
moved
down
the
slope
with
his
horrible
companions
in
a
few
moments
had
passed
the
foremost
of
the
throng--not
much
of
a
feat
considering
his
advantages
he
placed
himself
in
the
lead
his
wooden
sword
still
in
hand
and
solemnly
directed
the
march
conforming
his
pace
to
theirs
and
occasionally
turning
as
if
to
see
that
his
forces
did
not
straggle
surely
such
a
leader
never
before
had
such
a
following
scattered
about
upon
the
ground
now
slowly
narrowing
by
the
encroachment
of
this
awful
march
to
water
were
certain
articles
to
which
in
the
leader's
mind
were
coupled
no
significant
associations
an
occasional
blanket
tightly
rolled
lengthwise
doubled
and
the
ends
bound
together
with
a
string
a
heavy
knapsack
here
and
there
a
broken
rifle--such
things
in
short
as
are
found
in
the
rear
of
retreating
troops
the
spoor
of
men
flying
from
their
hunters
everywhere
near
the
creek
which
here
had
a
margin
of
lowland
the
earth
was
trodden
into
mud
by
the
feet
of
men
and
horses
an
observer
of
better
experience
in
the
use
of
his
eyes
would
have
noticed
that
these
footprints
pointed
in
both
directions
the
ground
had
been
twice
passed
over--in
advance
and
in
retreat
a
few
hours
before
these
desperate
stricken
men
with
their
more
fortunate
and
now
distant
comrades
had
penetrated
the
forest
in
thousands
their
successive
battalions
breaking
into
swarms
and
re-forming
in
lines
had
passed
the
child
on
every
side--had
almost
trodden
on
him
as
he
slept
the
rustle
and
murmur
of
their
march
had
not
awakened
him
almost
within
a
stone's
throw
of
where
he
lay
they
had
fought
a
battle
but
all
unheard
by
him
were
the
roar
of
the
musketry
the
shock
of
the
cannon
the
thunder
of
the
captains
and
the
shouting
he
had
slept
through
it
all
grasping
his
little
wooden
sword
with
perhaps
a
tighter
clutch
in
unconscious
sympathy
with
his
martial
environment
but
as
heedless
of
the
grandeur
of
the
struggle
as
the
dead
who
had
died
to
make
the
glory
the
fire
beyond
the
belt
of
woods
on
the
farther
side
of
the
creek
reflected
to
earth
from
the
canopy
of
its
own
smoke
was
now
suffusing
the
whole
landscape
it
transformed
the
sinuous
line
of
mist
to
the
vapor
of
gold
the
water
gleamed
with
dashes
of
red
and
red
too
were
many
of
the
stones
protruding
above
the
surface
but
that
was
blood
the
less
desperately
wounded
had
stained
them
in
crossing
on
them
too
the
child
now
crossed
with
eager
steps
he
was
going
to
the
fire
as
he
stood
upon
the
farther
bank
he
turned
about
to
look
at
the
companions
of
his
march
the
advance
was
arriving
at
the
creek
the
stronger
had
already
drawn
themselves
to
the
brink
and
plunged
their
faces
into
the
flood
three
or
four
who
lay
without
motion
appeared
to
have
no
heads
at
this
the
child's
eyes
expanded
with
wonder
even
his
hospitable
understanding
could
not
accept
a
phenomenon
implying
such
vitality
as
that
after
slaking
their
thirst
these
men
had
not
had
the
strength
to
back
away
from
the
water
nor
to
keep
their
heads
above
it
they
were
drowned
in
rear
of
these
the
open
spaces
of
the
forest
showed
the
leader
as
many
formless
figures
of
his
grim
command
as
at
first
but
not
nearly
so
many
were
in
motion
he
waved
his
cap
for
their
encouragement
and
smilingly
pointed
with
his
weapon
in
the
direction
of
the
guiding
light--a
pillar
of
fire
to
this
strange
exodus
confident
of
the
fidelity
of
his
forces
he
now
entered
the
belt
of
woods
passed
through
it
easily
in
the
red
illumination
climbed
a
fence
ran
across
a
field
turning
now
and
again
to
coquet
with
his
responsive
shadow
and
so
approached
the
blazing
ruin
of
a
dwelling
desolation
everywhere
in
all
the
wide
glare
not
a
living
thing
was
visible
he
cared
nothing
for
that
the
spectacle
pleased
and
he
danced
with
glee
in
imitation
of
the
wavering
flames
he
ran
about
collecting
fuel
but
every
object
that
he
found
was
too
heavy
for
him
to
cast
in
from
the
distance
to
which
the
heat
limited
his
approach
in
despair
he
flung
in
his
sword--a
surrender
to
the
superior
forces
of
nature
his
military
career
was
at
an
end
shifting
his
position
his
eyes
fell
upon
some
outbuildings
which
had
an
oddly
familiar
appearance
as
if
he
had
dreamed
of
them
he
stood
considering
them
with
wonder
when
suddenly
the
entire
plantation
with
its
inclosing
forest
seemed
to
turn
as
if
upon
a
pivot
his
little
world
swung
half
around
the
points
of
the
compass
were
reversed
he
recognized
the
blazing
building
as
his
own
home
for
a
moment
he
stood
stupefied
by
the
power
of
the
revelation
then
ran
with
stumbling
feet
making
a
half-circuit
of
the
ruin
there
conspicuous
in
the
light
of
the
conflagration
lay
the
dead
body
of
a
woman--the
white
face
turned
upward
the
hands
thrown
out
and
clutched
full
of
grass
the
clothing
deranged
the
long
dark
hair
in
tangles
and
full
of
clotted
blood
the
greater
part
of
the
forehead
was
torn
away
and
from
the
jagged
hole
the
brain
protruded
overflowing
the
temple
a
frothy
mass
of
gray
crowned
with
clusters
of
crimson
bubbles--the
work
of
a
shell
the
child
moved
his
little
hands
making
wild
uncertain
gestures
he
uttered
a
series
of
inarticulate
and
indescribable
cries--something
between
the
chattering
of
an
ape
and
the
gobbling
of
a
turkey--a
startling
soulless
unholy
sound
the
language
of
a
devil
the
child
was
a
deaf
mute
then
he
stood
motionless
with
quivering
lips
looking
down
upon
the
wreck
a
son
of
the
gods
a
study
in
the
present
tense
a
breezy
day
and
a
sunny
landscape
an
open
country
to
right
and
left
and
forward
behind
a
wood
in
the
edge
of
this
wood
facing
the
open
but
not
venturing
into
it
long
lines
of
troops
halted
the
wood
is
alive
with
them
and
full
of
confused
noises--the
occasional
rattle
of
wheels
as
a
battery
of
artillery
goes
into
position
to
cover
the
advance
the
hum
and
murmur
of
the
soldiers
talking
a
sound
of
innumerable
feet
in
the
dry
leaves
that
strew
the
interspaces
among
the
trees
hoarse
commands
of
officers
detached
groups
of
horsemen
are
well
in
front--not
altogether
exposed--many
of
them
intently
regarding
the
crest
of
a
hill
a
mile
away
in
the
direction
of
the
interrupted
advance
for
this
powerful
army
moving
in
battle
order
through
a
forest
has
met
with
a
formidable
obstacle--the
open
country
the
crest
of
that
gentle
hill
a
mile
away
has
a
sinister
look
it
says
beware
along
it
runs
a
stone
wall
extending
to
left
and
right
a
great
distance
behind
the
wall
is
a
hedge
behind
the
hedge
are
seen
the
tops
of
trees
in
rather
straggling
order
among
the
trees--what
it
is
necessary
to
know
yesterday
and
for
many
days
and
nights
previously
we
were
fighting
somewhere
always
there
was
cannonading
with
occasional
keen
rattlings
of
musketry
mingled
with
cheers
our
own
or
the
enemy's
we
seldom
knew
attesting
some
temporary
advantage
this
morning
at
daybreak
the
enemy
was
gone
we
have
moved
forward
across
his
earthworks
across
which
we
have
so
often
vainly
attempted
to
move
before
through
the
debris
of
his
abandoned
camps
among
the
graves
of
his
fallen
into
the
woods
beyond
how
curiously
we
had
regarded
everything
how
odd
it
all
had
seemed
nothing
had
appeared
quite
familiar
the
most
commonplace
objects--an
old
saddle
a
splintered
wheel
a
forgotten
canteen--everything
had
related
something
of
the
mysterious
personality
of
those
strange
men
who
had
been
killing
us
the
soldier
never
becomes
wholly
familiar
with
the
conception
of
his
foes
as
men
like
himself
he
cannot
divest
himself
of
the
feeling
that
they
are
another
order
of
beings
differently
conditioned
in
an
environment
not
altogether
of
the
earth
the
smallest
vestiges
of
them
rivet
his
attention
and
engage
his
interest
he
thinks
of
them
as
inaccessible
and
catching
an
unexpected
glimpse
of
them
they
appear
farther
away
and
therefore
larger
than
they
really
are--
like
objects
in
a
fog
he
is
somewhat
in
awe
of
them
from
the
edge
of
the
wood
leading
up
the
acclivity
are
the
tracks
of
horses
and
wheels--the
wheels
of
cannon
the
yellow
grass
is
beaten
down
by
the
feet
of
infantry
clearly
they
have
passed
this
way
in
thousands
they
have
not
withdrawn
by
the
country
roads
this
is
significant--it
is
the
difference
between
retiring
and
retreating
that
group
of
horsemen
is
our
commander
his
staff
and
escort
he
is
facing
the
distant
crest
holding
his
field-glass
against
his
eyes
with
both
hands
his
elbows
needlessly
elevated
it
is
a
fashion
it
seems
to
dignify
the
act
we
are
all
addicted
to
it
suddenly
he
lowers
the
glass
and
says
a
few
words
to
those
about
him
two
or
three
aides
detach
themselves
from
the
group
and
canter
away
into
the
woods
along
the
lines
in
each
direction
we
did
not
hear
his
words
but
we
know
them
tell
general
x
to
send
forward
the
skirmish
line
those
of
us
who
have
been
out
of
place
resume
our
positions
the
men
resting
at
ease
straighten
themselves
and
the
ranks
are
re-formed
without
a
command
some
of
us
staff
officers
dismount
and
look
at
our
saddle
girths
those
already
on
the
ground
remount
galloping
rapidly
along
in
the
edge
of
the
open
ground
comes
a
young
officer
on
a
snow-white
horse
his
saddle
blanket
is
scarlet
what
a
fool
no
one
who
has
ever
been
in
action
but
remembers
how
naturally
every
rifle
turns
toward
the
man
on
a
white
horse
no
one
but
has
observed
how
a
bit
of
red
enrages
the
bull
of
battle
that
such
colors
are
fashionable
in
military
life
must
be
accepted
as
the
most
astonishing
of
all
the
phenomena
of
human
vanity
they
would
seem
to
have
been
devised
to
increase
the
death-rate
this
young
officer
is
in
full
uniform
as
if
on
parade
he
is
all
agleam
with
bullion--a
blue-and-gold
edition
of
the
poetry
of
war
a
wave
of
derisive
laughter
runs
abreast
of
him
all
along
the
line
but
how
handsome
he
is--with
what
careless
grace
he
sits
his
horse
he
reins
up
within
a
respectful
distance
of
the
corps
commander
and
salutes
the
old
soldier
nods
familiarly
he
evidently
knows
him
a
brief
colloquy
between
them
is
going
on
the
young
man
seems
to
be
preferring
some
request
which
the
elder
one
is
indisposed
to
grant
let
us
ride
a
little
nearer
ah
too
late--it
is
ended
the
young
officer
salutes
again
wheels
his
horse
and
rides
straight
toward
the
crest
of
the
hill
a
thin
line
of
skirmishers
the
men
deployed
at
six
paces
or
so
apart
now
pushes
from
the
wood
into
the
open
the
commander
speaks
to
his
bugler
who
claps
his
instrument
to
his
lips
tra-la-la
tra-la-la
the
skirmishers
halt
in
their
tracks
meantime
the
young
horseman
has
advanced
a
hundred
yards
he
is
riding
at
a
walk
straight
up
the
long
slope
with
never
a
turn
of
the
head
how
glorious
gods
what
would
we
not
give
to
be
in
his
place--with
his
soul
he
does
not
draw
his
sabre
his
right
hand
hangs
easily
at
his
side
the
breeze
catches
the
plume
in
his
hat
and
flutters
it
smartly
the
sunshine
rests
upon
his
shoulder-straps
lovingly
like
a
visible
benediction
straight
on
he
rides
ten
thousand
pairs
of
eyes
are
fixed
upon
him
with
an
intensity
that
he
can
hardly
fail
to
feel
ten
thousand
hearts
keep
quick
time
to
the
inaudible
hoof-beats
of
his
snowy
steed
he
is
not
alone--he
draws
all
souls
after
him
but
we
remember
that
we
laughed
on
and
on
straight
for
the
hedge-lined
wall
he
rides
not
a
look
backward
o
if
he
would
but
turn--if
he
could
but
see
the
love
the
adoration
the
atonement
not
a
word
is
spoken
the
populous
depths
of
the
forest
still
murmur
with
their
unseen
and
unseeing
swarm
but
all
along
the
fringe
is
silence
the
burly
commander
is
an
equestrian
statue
of
himself
the
mounted
staff
officers
their
field
glasses
up
are
motionless
all
the
line
of
battle
in
the
edge
of
the
wood
stands
at
a
new
kind
of
attention
each
man
in
the
attitude
in
which
he
was
caught
by
the
consciousness
of
what
is
going
on
all
these
hardened
and
impenitent
man-killers
to
whom
death
in
its
awfulest
forms
is
a
fact
familiar
to
their
every-day
observation
who
sleep
on
hills
trembling
with
the
thunder
of
great
guns
dine
in
the
midst
of
streaming
missiles
and
play
at
cards
among
the
dead
faces
of
their
dearest
friends--all
are
watching
with
suspended
breath
and
beating
hearts
the
outcome
of
an
act
involving
the
life
of
one
man
such
is
the
magnetism
of
courage
and
devotion
if
now
you
should
turn
your
head
you
would
see
a
simultaneous
movement
among
the
spectators--a
start
as
if
they
had
received
an
electric
shock--and
looking
forward
again
to
the
now
distant
horseman
you
would
see
that
he
has
in
that
instant
altered
his
direction
and
is
riding
at
an
angle
to
his
former
course
the
spectators
suppose
the
sudden
deflection
to
be
caused
by
a
shot
perhaps
a
wound
but
take
this
field-glass
and
you
will
observe
that
he
is
riding
toward
a
break
in
the
wall
and
hedge
he
means
if
not
killed
to
ride
through
and
overlook
the
country
beyond
you
are
not
to
forget
the
nature
of
this
man's
act
it
is
not
permitted
to
you
to
think
of
it
as
an
instance
of
bravado
nor
on
the
other
hand
a
needless
sacrifice
of
self
if
the
enemy
has
not
retreated
he
is
in
force
on
that
ridge
the
investigator
will
encounter
nothing
less
than
a
line-of-battle
there
is
no
need
of
pickets
videttes
skirmishers
to
give
warning
of
our
approach
our
attacking
lines
will
be
visible
conspicuous
exposed
to
an
artillery
fire
that
will
shave
the
ground
the
moment
they
break
from
cover
and
for
half
the
distance
to
a
sheet
of
rifle
bullets
in
which
nothing
can
live
in
short
if
the
enemy
is
there
it
would
be
madness
to
attack
him
in
front
he
must
be
manoeuvred
out
by
the
immemorial
plan
of
threatening
his
line
of
communication
as
necessary
to
his
existence
as
to
the
diver
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
his
air
tube
but
how
ascertain
if
the
enemy
is
there
there
is
but
one
way--somebody
must
go
and
see
the
natural
and
customary
thing
to
do
is
to
send
forward
a
line
of
skirmishers
but
in
this
case
they
will
answer
in
the
affirmative
with
all
their
lives
the
enemy
crouching
in
double
ranks
behind
the
stone
wall
and
in
cover
of
the
hedge
will
wait
until
it
is
possible
to
count
each
assailant's
teeth
at
the
first
volley
a
half
of
the
questioning
line
will
fall
the
other
half
before
it
can
accomplish
the
predestined
retreat
what
a
price
to
pay
for
gratified
curiosity
at
what
a
dear
rate
an
army
must
sometimes
purchase
knowledge
let
me
pay
all
says
this
gallant
man--this
military
christ
there
is
no
hope
except
the
hope
against
hope
that
the
crest
is
clear
true
he
might
prefer
capture
to
death
so
long
as
he
advances
the
line
will
not
fire--why
should
it
he
can
safely
ride
into
the
hostile
ranks
and
become
a
prisoner
of
war
but
this
would
defeat
his
object
it
would
not
answer
our
question
it
is
necessary
either
that
he
return
unharmed
or
be
shot
to
death
before
our
eyes
only
so
shall
we
know
how
to
act
if
captured--why
that
might
have
been
done
by
a
half-dozen
stragglers
now
begins
an
extraordinary
contest
of
intellect
between
a
man
and
an
army
our
horseman
now
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
crest
suddenly
wheels
to
the
left
and
gallops
in
a
direction
parallel
to
it
he
has
caught
sight
of
his
antagonist
he
knows
all
some
slight
advantage
of
ground
has
enabled
him
to
overlook
a
part
of
the
line
if
he
were
here
he
could
tell
us
in
words
but
that
is
now
hopeless
he
must
make
the
best
use
of
the
few
minutes
of
life
remaining
to
him
by
compelling
the
enemy
himself
to
tell
us
as
much
and
as
plainly
as
possible--which
naturally
that
discreet
power
is
reluctant
to
do
not
a
rifleman
in
those
crouching
ranks
not
a
cannoneer
at
those
masked
and
shotted
guns
but
knows
the
needs
of
the
situation
the
imperative
duty
of
forbearance
besides
there
has
been
time
enough
to
forbid
them
all
to
fire
true
a
single
rifle-shot
might
drop
him
and
be
no
great
disclosure
but
firing
is
infectious--and
see
how
rapidly
he
moves
with
never
a
pause
except
as
he
whirls
his
horse
about
to
take
a
new
direction
never
directly
backward
toward
us
never
directly
forward
toward
his
executioners
all
this
is
visible
through
the
glass
it
seems
occurring
within
pistol-shot
we
see
all
but
the
enemy
whose
presence
whose
thoughts
whose
motives
we
infer
to
the
unaided
eye
there
is
nothing
but
a
black
figure
on
a
white
horse
tracing
slow
zigzags
against
the
slope
of
a
distant
hill--so
slowly
they
seem
almost
to
creep
now--the
glass
again--he
has
tired
of
his
failure
or
sees
his
error
or
has
gone
mad
he
is
dashing
directly
forward
at
the
wall
as
if
to
take
it
at
a
leap
hedge
and
all
one
moment
only
and
he
wheels
right
about
and
is
speeding
like
the
wind
straight
down
the
slope--toward
his
friends
toward
his
death
instantly
the
wall
is
topped
with
a
fierce
roll
of
smoke
for
a
distance
of
hundreds
of
yards
to
right
and
left
this
is
as
instantly
dissipated
by
the
wind
and
before
the
rattle
of
the
rifles
reaches
us
he
is
down
no
he
recovers
his
seat
he
has
but
pulled
his
horse
upon
its
haunches
they
are
up
and
away
a
tremendous
cheer
bursts
from
our
ranks
relieving
the
insupportable
tension
of
our
feelings
and
the
horse
and
its
rider
yes
they
are
up
and
away
away
indeed--they
are
making
directly
to
our
left
parallel
to
the
now
steadily
blazing
and
smoking
wall
the
rattle
of
the
musketry
is
continuous
and
every
bullet's
target
is
that
courageous
heart
suddenly
a
great
bank
of
white
smoke
pushes
upward
from
behind
the
wall
another
and
another--a
dozen
roll
up
before
the
thunder
of
the
explosions
and
the
humming
of
the
missiles
reach
our
ears
and
the
missiles
themselves
come
bounding
through
clouds
of
dust
into
our
covert
knocking
over
here
and
there
a
man
and
causing
a
temporary
distraction
a
passing
thought
of
self
the
dust
drifts
away
incredible--that
enchanted
horse
and
rider
have
passed
a
ravine
and
are
climbing
another
slope
to
unveil
another
conspiracy
of
silence
to
thwart
the
will
of
another
armed
host
another
moment
and
that
crest
too
is
in
eruption
the
horse
rears
and
strikes
the
air
with
its
forefeet
they
are
down
at
last
but
look
again--the
man
has
detached
himself
from
the
dead
animal
he
stands
erect
motionless
holding
his
sabre
in
his
right
hand
straight
above
his
head
his
face
is
toward
us
now
he
lowers
his
hand
to
a
level
with
his
face
and
moves
it
outward
the
blade
of
the
sabre
describing
a
downward
curve
it
is
a
sign
to
us
to
the
world
to
posterity
it
is
a
hero's
salute
to
death
and
history
again
the
spell
is
broken
our
men
attempt
to
cheer
they
are
choking
with
emotion
they
utter
hoarse
discordant
cries
they
clutch
their
weapons
and
press
tumultuously
forward
into
the
open
the
skirmishers
without
orders
against
orders
are
going
forward
at
a
keen
run
like
hounds
unleashed
our
cannon
speak
and
the
enemy's
now
open
in
full
chorus
to
right
and
left
as
far
as
we
can
see
the
distant
crest
seeming
now
so
near
erects
its
towers
of
cloud
and
the
great
shot
pitch
roaring
down
among
our
moving
masses
flag
after
flag
of
ours
emerges
from
the
wood
line
after
line
sweeps
forth
catching
the
sunlight
on
its
burnished
arms
the
rear
battalions
alone
are
in
obedience
they
preserve
their
proper
distance
from
the
insurgent
front
the
commander
has
not
moved
he
now
removes
his
field-glass
from
his
eyes
and
glances
to
the
right
and
left
he
sees
the
human
current
flowing
on
either
side
of
him
and
his
huddled
escort
like
tide
waves
parted
by
a
rock
not
a
sign
of
feeling
in
his
face
he
is
thinking
again
he
directs
his
eyes
forward
they
slowly
traverse
that
malign
and
awful
crest
he
addresses
a
calm
word
to
his
bugler
tra-la-la
tra-la-la
the
injunction
has
an
imperiousness
which
enforces
it
it
is
repeated
by
all
the
bugles
of
all
the
sub-ordinate
commanders
the
sharp
metallic
notes
assert
themselves
above
the
hum
of
the
advance
and
penetrate
the
sound
of
the
cannon
to
halt
is
to
withdraw
the
colors
move
slowly
back
the
lines
face
about
and
sullenly
follow
bearing
their
wounded
the
skirmishers
return
gathering
up
the
dead
ah
those
many
many
needless
dead
that
great
soul
whose
beautiful
body
is
lying
over
yonder
so
conspicuous
against
the
sere
hillside--could
it
not
have
been
spared
the
bitter
consciousness
of
a
vain
devotion
would
one
exception
have
marred
too
much
the
pitiless
perfection
of
the
divine
eternal
plan
one
of
the
missing
jerome
searing
a
private
soldier
of
general
sherman's
army
then
confronting
the
enemy
at
and
about
kennesaw
mountain
georgia
turned
his
back
upon
a
small
group
of
officers
with
whom
he
had
been
talking
in
low
tones
stepped
across
a
light
line
of
earthworks
and
disappeared
in
a
forest
none
of
the
men
in
line
behind
the
works
had
said
a
word
to
him
nor
had
he
so
much
as
nodded
to
them
in
passing
but
all
who
saw
understood
that
this
brave
man
had
been
intrusted
with
some
perilous
duty
jerome
searing
though
a
private
did
not
serve
in
the
ranks
he
was
detailed
for
service
at
division
headquarters
being
borne
upon
the
rolls
as
an
orderly
orderly
is
a
word
covering
a
multitude
of
duties
an
orderly
may
be
a
messenger
a
clerk
an
officer's
servant--anything
he
may
perform
services
for
which
no
provision
is
made
in
orders
and
army
regulations
their
nature
may
depend
upon
his
aptitude
upon
favor
upon
accident
private
searing
an
incomparable
marksman
young
hardy
intelligent
and
insensible
to
fear
was
a
scout
the
general
commanding
his
division
was
not
content
to
obey
orders
blindly
without
knowing
what
was
in
his
front
even
when
his
command
was
not
on
detached
service
but
formed
a
fraction
of
the
line
of
the
army
nor
was
he
satisfied
to
receive
his
knowledge
of
his
vis-ã
-vis
through
the
customary
channels
he
wanted
to
know
more
than
he
was
apprised
of
by
the
corps
commander
and
the
collisions
of
pickets
and
skirmishers
hence
jerome
searing
with
his
extraordinary
daring
his
woodcraft
his
sharp
eyes
and
truthful
tongue
on
this
occasion
his
instructions
were
simple
to
get
as
near
the
enemy's
lines
as
possible
and
learn
all
that
he
could
in
a
few
moments
he
had
arrived
at
the
picket-line
the
men
on
duty
there
lying
in
groups
of
two
and
four
behind
little
banks
of
earth
scooped
out
of
the
slight
depression
in
which
they
lay
their
rifles
protruding
from
the
green
boughs
with
which
they
had
masked
their
small
defenses
the
forest
extended
without
a
break
toward
the
front
so
solemn
and
silent
that
only
by
an
effort
of
the
imagination
could
it
be
conceived
as
populous
with
armed
men
alert
and
vigilant--a
forest
formidable
with
possibilities
of
battle
pausing
a
moment
in
one
of
these
rifle-pits
to
apprise
the
men
of
his
intention
searing
crept
stealthily
forward
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
was
soon
lost
to
view
in
a
dense
thicket
of
underbrush
that
is
the
last
of
him
said
one
of
the
men
i
wish
i
had
his
rifle
those
fellows
will
hurt
some
of
us
with
it
searing
crept
on
taking
advantage
of
every
accident
of
ground
and
growth
to
give
himself
better
cover
his
eyes
penetrated
everywhere
his
ears
took
note
of
every
sound
he
stilled
his
breathing
and
at
the
cracking
of
a
twig
beneath
his
knee
stopped
his
progress
and
hugged
the
earth
it
was
slow
work
but
not
tedious
the
danger
made
it
exciting
but
by
no
physical
signs
was
the
excitement
manifest
his
pulse
was
as
regular
his
nerves
were
as
steady
as
if
he
were
trying
to
trap
a
sparrow
it
seems
a
long
time
he
thought
but
i
cannot
have
come
very
far
i
am
still
alive
he
smiled
at
his
own
method
of
estimating
distance
and
crept
forward
a
moment
later
he
suddenly
flattened
himself
upon
the
earth
and
lay
motionless
minute
after
minute
through
a
narrow
opening
in
the
bushes
he
had
caught
sight
of
a
small
mound
of
yellow
clay--one
of
the
enemy's
rifle-pits
after
some
little
time
he
cautiously
raised
his
head
inch
by
inch
then
his
body
upon
his
hands
spread
out
on
each
side
of
him
all
the
while
intently
regarding
the
hillock
of
clay
in
another
moment
he
was
upon
his
feet
rifle
in
hand
striding
rapidly
forward
with
little
attempt
at
concealment
he
had
rightly
interpreted
the
signs
whatever
they
were
the
enemy
was
gone
to
assure
himself
beyond
a
doubt
before
going
back
to
report
upon
so
important
a
matter
searing
pushed
forward
across
the
line
of
abandoned
pits
running
from
cover
to
cover
in
the
more
open
forest
his
eyes
vigilant
to
discover
possible
stragglers
he
came
to
the
edge
of
a
plantation--one
of
those
forlorn
deserted
homesteads
of
the
last
years
of
the
war
upgrown
with
brambles
ugly
with
broken
fences
and
desolate
with
vacant
buildings
having
blank
apertures
in
place
of
doors
and
windows
after
a
keen
reconnoissance
from
the
safe
seclusion
of
a
clump
of
young
pines
searing
ran
lightly
across
a
field
and
through
an
orchard
to
a
small
structure
which
stood
apart
from
the
other
farm
buildings
on
a
slight
elevation
this
he
thought
would
enable
him
to
overlook
a
large
scope
of
country
in
the
direction
that
he
supposed
the
enemy
to
have
taken
in
withdrawing
this
building
which
had
originally
consisted
of
a
single
room
elevated
upon
four
posts
about
ten
feet
high
was
now
little
more
than
a
roof
the
floor
had
fallen
away
the
joists
and
planks
loosely
piled
on
the
ground
below
or
resting
on
end
at
various
angles
not
wholly
torn
from
their
fastenings
above
the
supporting
posts
were
themselves
no
longer
vertical
it
looked
as
if
the
whole
edifice
would
go
down
at
the
touch
of
a
finger
concealing
himself
in
the
debris
of
joists
and
flooring
searing
looked
across
the
open
ground
between
his
point
of
view
and
a
spur
of
kennesaw
mountain
a
half-mile
away
a
road
leading
up
and
across
this
spur
was
crowded
with
troops--the
rear-guard
of
the
retiring
enemy
their
gun-barrels
gleaming
in
the
morning
sunlight
searing
had
now
learned
all
that
he
could
hope
to
know
it
was
his
duty
to
return
to
his
own
command
with
all
possible
speed
and
report
his
discovery
but
the
gray
column
of
confederates
toiling
up
the
mountain
road
was
singularly
tempting
his
rifle--an
ordinary
springfield
but
fitted
with
a
globe
sight
and
hair-trigger--would
easily
send
its
ounce
and
a
quarter
of
lead
hissing
into
their
midst
that
would
probably
not
affect
the
duration
and
result
of
the
war
but
it
is
the
business
of
a
soldier
to
kill
it
is
also
his
habit
if
he
is
a
good
soldier
searing
cocked
his
rifle
and
set
the
trigger
but
it
was
decreed
from
the
beginning
of
time
that
private
searing
was
not
to
murder
anybody
that
bright
summer
morning
nor
was
the
confederate
retreat
to
be
announced
by
him
for
countless
ages
events
had
been
so
matching
themselves
together
in
that
wondrous
mosaic
to
some
parts
of
which
dimly
discernible
we
give
the
name
of
history
that
the
acts
which
he
had
in
will
would
have
marred
the
harmony
of
the
pattern
some
twenty-five
years
previously
the
power
charged
with
the
execution
of
the
work
according
to
the
design
had
provided
against
that
mischance
by
causing
the
birth
of
a
certain
male
child
in
a
little
village
at
the
foot
of
the
carpathian
mountains
had
carefully
reared
it
supervised
its
education
directed
its
desires
into
a
military
channel
and
in
due
time
made
it
an
officer
of
artillery
by
the
concurrence
of
an
infinite
number
of
favoring
influences
and
their
preponderance
over
an
infinite
number
of
opposing
ones
this
officer
of
artillery
had
been
made
to
commit
a
breach
of
discipline
and
flee
from
his
native
country
to
avoid
punishment
he
had
been
directed
to
new
orleans
instead
of
new
york
where
a
recruiting
officer
awaited
him
on
the
wharf
he
was
enlisted
and
promoted
and
things
were
so
ordered
that
he
now
commanded
a
confederate
battery
some
two
miles
along
the
line
from
where
jerome
searing
the
federal
scout
stood
cocking
his
rifle
nothing
had
been
neglected--at
every
step
in
the
progress
of
both
these
men's
lives
and
in
the
lives
of
their
contemporaries
and
ancestors
and
in
the
lives
of
the
contemporaries
of
their
ancestors
the
right
thing
had
been
done
to
bring
about
the
desired
result
had
anything
in
all
this
vast
concatenation
been
overlooked
private
searing
might
have
fired
on
the
retreating
confederates
that
morning
and
would
perhaps
have
missed
as
it
fell
out
a
confederate
captain
of
artillery
having
nothing
better
to
do
while
awaiting
his
turn
to
pull
out
and
be
off
amused
himself
by
sighting
a
field-piece
obliquely
to
his
right
at
what
he
mistook
for
some
federal
officers
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
and
discharged
it
the
shot
flew
high
of
its
mark
as
jerome
searing
drew
back
the
hammer
of
his
rifle
and
with
his
eyes
upon
the
distant
confederates
considered
where
he
could
plant
his
shot
with
the
best
hope
of
making
a
widow
or
an
orphan
or
a
childless
mother--perhaps
all
three
for
private
searing
although
he
had
repeatedly
refused
promotion
was
not
without
a
certain
kind
of
ambition--he
heard
a
rushing
sound
in
the
air
like
that
made
by
the
wings
of
a
great
bird
swooping
down
upon
its
prey
more
quickly
than
he
could
apprehend
the
gradation
it
increased
to
a
hoarse
and
horrible
roar
as
the
missile
that
made
it
sprang
at
him
out
of
the
sky
striking
with
a
deafening
impact
one
of
the
posts
supporting
the
confusion
of
timbers
above
him
smashing
it
into
matchwood
and
bringing
down
the
crazy
edifice
with
a
loud
clatter
in
clouds
of
blinding
dust
when
jerome
searing
recovered
consciousness
he
did
not
at
once
understand
what
had
occurred
it
was
indeed
some
time
before
he
opened
his
eyes
for
a
while
he
believed
that
he
had
died
and
been
buried
and
he
tried
to
recall
some
portions
of
the
burial
service
he
thought
that
his
wife
was
kneeling
upon
his
grave
adding
her
weight
to
that
of
the
earth
upon
his
breast
the
two
of
them
widow
and
earth
had
crushed
his
coffin
unless
the
children
should
persuade
her
to
go
home
he
would
not
much
longer
be
able
to
breathe
he
felt
a
sense
of
wrong
i
cannot
speak
to
her
he
thought
the
dead
have
no
voice
and
if
i
open
my
eyes
i
shall
get
them
full
of
earth
he
opened
his
eyes
a
great
expanse
of
blue
sky
rising
from
a
fringe
of
the
tops
of
trees
in
the
foreground
shutting
out
some
of
the
trees
a
high
dun
mound
angular
in
outline
and
crossed
by
an
intricate
patternless
system
of
straight
lines
the
whole
an
immeasurable
distance
away--a
distance
so
inconceivably
great
that
it
fatigued
him
and
he
closed
his
eyes
the
moment
that
he
did
so
he
was
conscious
of
an
insufferable
light
a
sound
was
in
his
ears
like
the
low
rhythmic
thunder
of
a
distant
sea
breaking
in
successive
waves
upon
the
beach
and
out
of
this
noise
seeming
a
part
of
it
or
possibly
coming
from
beyond
it
and
intermingled
with
its
ceaseless
undertone
came
the
articulate
words
jerome
searing
you
are
caught
like
a
rat
in
a
trap--
in
a
trap
trap
trap
suddenly
there
fell
a
great
silence
a
black
darkness
an
infinite
tranquillity
and
jerome
searing
perfectly
conscious
of
his
rathood
and
well
assured
of
the
trap
that
he
was
in
remembering
all
and
nowise
alarmed
again
opened
his
eyes
to
reconnoitre
to
note
the
strength
of
his
enemy
to
plan
his
defense
he
was
caught
in
a
reclining
posture
his
back
firmly
supported
by
a
solid
beam
another
lay
across
his
breast
but
he
had
been
able
to
shrink
a
little
away
from
it
so
that
it
no
longer
oppressed
him
though
it
was
immovable
a
brace
joining
it
at
an
angle
had
wedged
him
against
a
pile
of
boards
on
his
left
fastening
the
arm
on
that
side
his
legs
slightly
parted
and
straight
along
the
ground
were
covered
upward
to
the
knees
with
a
mass
of
debris
which
towered
above
his
narrow
horizon
his
head
was
as
rigidly
fixed
as
in
a
vise
he
could
move
his
eyes
his
chin--no
more
only
his
right
arm
was
partly
free
you
must
help
us
out
of
this
he
said
to
it
but
he
could
not
get
it
from
under
the
heavy
timber
athwart
his
chest
nor
move
it
outward
more
than
six
inches
at
the
elbow
searing
was
not
seriously
injured
nor
did
he
suffer
pain
a
smart
rap
on
the
head
from
a
flying
fragment
of
the
splintered
post
incurred
simultaneously
with
the
frightfully
sudden
shock
to
the
nervous
system
had
momentarily
dazed
him
his
term
of
unconsciousness
including
the
period
of
recovery
during
which
he
had
had
the
strange
fancies
had
probably
not
exceeded
a
few
seconds
for
the
dust
of
the
wreck
had
not
wholly
cleared
away
as
he
began
an
intelligent
survey
of
the
situation
with
his
partly
free
right
hand
he
now
tried
to
get
hold
of
the
beam
that
lay
across
but
not
quite
against
his
breast
in
no
way
could
he
do
so
he
was
unable
to
depress
the
shoulder
so
as
to
push
the
elbow
beyond
that
edge
of
the
timber
which
was
nearest
his
knees
failing
in
that
he
could
not
raise
the
forearm
and
hand
to
grasp
the
beam
the
brace
that
made
an
angle
with
it
downward
and
backward
prevented
him
from
doing
anything
in
that
direction
and
between
it
and
his
body
the
space
was
not
half
so
wide
as
the
length
of
his
forearm
obviously
he
could
not
get
his
hand
under
the
beam
nor
over
it
the
hand
could
not
in
fact
touch
it
at
all
having
demonstrated
his
inability
he
desisted
and
began
to
think
whether
he
could
reach
any
of
the
dã©bris
piled
upon
his
legs
in
surveying
the
mass
with
a
view
to
determining
that
point
his
attention
was
arrested
by
what
seemed
to
be
a
ring
of
shining
metal
immediately
in
front
of
his
eyes
it
appeared
to
him
at
first
to
surround
some
perfectly
black
substance
and
it
was
somewhat
more
than
a
half-inch
in
diameter
it
suddenly
occurred
to
his
mind
that
the
blackness
was
simply
shadow
and
that
the
ring
was
in
fact
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
protruding
from
the
pile
of
dã©bris
he
was
not
long
in
satisfying
himself
that
this
was
so--if
it
was
a
satisfaction
by
closing
either
eye
he
could
look
a
little
way
along
the
barrel--to
the
point
where
it
was
hidden
by
the
rubbish
that
held
it
he
could
see
the
one
side
with
the
corresponding
eye
at
apparently
the
same
angle
as
the
other
side
with
the
other
eye
looking
with
the
right
eye
the
weapon
seemed
to
be
directed
at
a
point
to
the
left
of
his
head
and
vice-versa
he
was
unable
to
see
the
upper
surface
of
the
barrel
but
could
see
the
under
surface
of
the
stock
at
a
slight
angle
the
piece
was
in
fact
aimed
at
the
exact
centre
of
his
forehead
in
the
perception
of
this
circumstance
in
the
recollection
that
just
previously
to
the
mischance
of
which
this
uncomfortable
situation
was
the
result
he
had
cocked
the
rifle
and
set
the
trigger
so
that
a
touch
would
discharge
it
private
searing
was
affected
with
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
but
that
was
as
far
as
possible
from
fear
he
was
a
brave
man
somewhat
familiar
with
the
aspect
of
rifles
from
that
point
of
view
and
of
cannon
too
and
now
he
recalled
with
something
like
amusement
an
incident
of
his
experience
at
the
storming
of
missionary
ridge
where
walking
up
to
one
of
the
enemy's
embrasures
from
which
he
had
seen
a
heavy
gun
throw
charge
after
charge
of
grape
among
the
assailants
he
had
thought
for
a
moment
that
the
piece
had
been
withdrawn
he
could
see
nothing
in
the
opening
but
a
brazen
circle
what
that
was
he
had
understood
just
in
time
to
step
aside
as
it
pitched
another
peck
of
iron
down
that
swarming
slope
to
face
firearms
is
one
of
the
commonest
incidents
in
a
soldier's
life--firearms
too
with
malevolent
eyes
blazing
behind
them
that
is
what
a
soldier
is
for
still
private
searing
did
not
altogether
relish
the
situation
and
turned
away
his
eyes
after
groping
aimless
with
his
right
hand
for
a
time
he
made
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
release
his
left
then
he
tried
to
disengage
his
head
the
fixity
of
which
was
the
more
annoying
from
his
ignorance
of
what
held
it
next
he
tried
to
free
his
feet
but
while
exerting
the
powerful
muscles
of
his
legs
for
that
purpose
it
occurred
to
him
that
a
disturbance
of
the
rubbish
which
held
them
might
discharge
the
rifle
how
it
could
have
endured
what
had
already
befallen
it
he
could
not
understand
although
memory
assisted
him
with
several
instances
in
point
one
in
particular
he
recalled
in
which
in
a
moment
of
mental
abstraction
he
had
clubbed
his
rifle
and
beaten
out
another
gentleman's
brains
observing
afterward
that
the
weapon
which
he
had
been
diligently
swinging
by
the
muzzle
was
loaded
capped
and
at
full
cock--knowledge
of
which
circumstance
would
doubtless
have
cheered
his
antagonist
to
longer
endurance
he
had
always
smiled
in
recalling
that
blunder
of
his
green
and
salad
days
as
a
soldier
but
now
he
did
not
smile
he
turned
his
eyes
again
to
the
muzzle
of
the
rifle
and
for
a
moment
fancied
that
it
had
moved
it
seemed
somewhat
nearer
again
he
looked
away
the
tops
of
the
distant
trees
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
plantation
interested
him
he
had
not
before
observed
how
light
and
feathery
they
were
nor
how
darkly
blue
the
sky
was
even
among
their
branches
where
they
somewhat
paled
it
with
their
green
above
him
it
appeared
almost
black
it
will
be
uncomfortably
hot
here
he
thought
as
the
day
advances
i
wonder
which
way
i
am
looking
judging
by
such
shadows
as
he
could
see
he
decided
that
his
face
was
due
north
he
would
at
least
not
have
the
sun
in
his
eyes
and
north--
well
that
was
toward
his
wife
and
children
bah
he
exclaimed
aloud
what
have
they
to
do
with
it
he
closed
his
eyes
as
i
can't
get
out
i
may
as
well
go
to
sleep
the
rebels
are
gone
and
some
of
our
fellows
are
sure
to
stray
out
here
foraging
they'll
find
me
but
he
did
not
sleep
gradually
he
became
sensible
of
a
pain
in
his
forehead--a
dull
ache
hardly
perceptible
at
first
but
growing
more
and
more
uncomfortable
he
opened
his
eyes
and
it
was
gone--closed
them
and
it
returned
the
devil
he
said
irrelevantly
and
stared
again
at
the
sky
he
heard
the
singing
of
birds
the
strange
metallic
note
of
the
meadow
lark
suggesting
the
clash
of
vibrant
blades
he
fell
into
pleasant
memories
of
his
childhood
played
again
with
his
brother
and
sister
raced
across
the
fields
shouting
to
alarm
the
sedentary
larks
entered
the
sombre
forest
beyond
and
with
timid
steps
followed
the
faint
path
to
ghost
rock
standing
at
last
with
audible
heart-throbs
before
the
dead
man's
cave
and
seeking
to
penetrate
its
awful
mystery
for
the
first
time
he
observed
that
the
opening
of
the
haunted
cavern
was
encircled
by
a
ring
of
metal
then
all
else
vanished
and
left
him
gazing
into
the
barrel
of
his
rifle
as
before
but
whereas
before
it
had
seemed
nearer
it
now
seemed
an
inconceivable
distance
away
and
all
the
more
sinister
for
that
he
cried
out
and
startled
by
something
in
his
own
voice--the
note
of
fear--lied
to
himself
in
denial
if
i
don't
sing
out
i
may
stay
here
till
i
die
he
now
made
no
further
attempt
to
evade
the
menacing
stare
of
the
gun
barrel
if
he
turned
away
his
eyes
an
instant
it
was
to
look
for
assistance
although
he
could
not
see
the
ground
on
either
side
the
ruin
and
he
permitted
them
to
return
obedient
to
the
imperative
fascination
if
he
closed
them
it
was
from
weariness
and
instantly
the
poignant
pain
in
his
forehead--the
prophecy
and
menace
of
the
bullet--
forced
him
to
reopen
them
the
tension
of
nerve
and
brain
was
too
severe
nature
came
to
his
relief
with
intervals
of
unconsciousness
reviving
from
one
of
these
he
became
sensible
of
a
sharp
smarting
pain
in
his
right
hand
and
when
he
worked
his
fingers
together
or
rubbed
his
palm
with
them
he
could
feel
that
they
were
wet
and
slippery
he
could
not
see
the
hand
but
he
knew
the
sensation
it
was
running
blood
in
his
delirium
he
had
beaten
it
against
the
jagged
fragments
of
the
wreck
had
clutched
it
full
of
splinters
he
resolved
that
he
would
meet
his
fate
more
manly
he
was
a
plain
common
soldier
had
no
religion
and
not
much
philosophy
he
could
not
die
like
a
hero
with
great
and
wise
last
words
even
if
there
had
been
some
one
to
hear
them
but
he
could
die
game
and
he
would
but
if
he
could
only
know
when
to
expect
the
shot
some
rats
which
had
probably
inhabited
the
shed
came
sneaking
and
scampering
about
one
of
them
mounted
the
pile
of
dã©bris
that
held
the
rifle
another
followed
and
another
searing
regarded
them
at
first
with
indifference
then
with
friendly
interest
then
as
the
thought
flashed
into
his
bewildered
mind
that
they
might
touch
the
trigger
of
his
rifle
he
cursed
them
and
ordered
them
to
go
away
it
is
no
business
of
yours
he
cried
the
creatures
went
away
they
would
return
later
attack
his
face
gnaw
away
his
nose
cut
his
throat--he
knew
that
but
he
hoped
by
that
time
to
be
dead
nothing
could
now
unfix
his
gaze
from
the
little
ring
of
metal
with
its
black
interior
the
pain
in
his
forehead
was
fierce
and
incessant
he
felt
it
gradually
penetrating
the
brain
more
and
more
deeply
until
at
last
its
progress
was
arrested
by
the
wood
at
the
back
of
his
head
it
grew
momentarily
more
insufferable
he
began
wantonly
beating
his
lacerated
hand
against
the
splinters
again
to
counteract
that
horrible
ache
it
seemed
to
throb
with
a
slow
regular
recurrence
each
pulsation
sharper
than
the
preceding
and
sometimes
he
cried
out
thinking
he
felt
the
fatal
bullet
no
thoughts
of
home
of
wife
and
children
of
country
of
glory
the
whole
record
of
memory
was
effaced
the
world
had
passed
away--not
a
vestige
remained
here
in
this
confusion
of
timbers
and
boards
is
the
sole
universe
here
is
immortality
in
time--each
pain
an
everlasting
life
the
throbs
tick
off
eternities
jerome
searing
the
man
of
courage
the
formidable
enemy
the
strong
resolute
warrior
was
as
pale
as
a
ghost
his
jaw
was
fallen
his
eyes
protruded
he
trembled
in
every
fibre
a
cold
sweat
bathed
his
entire
body
he
screamed
with
fear
he
was
not
insane--he
was
terrified
in
groping
about
with
his
torn
and
bleeding
hand
he
seized
at
last
a
strip
of
board
and
pulling
felt
it
give
way
it
lay
parallel
with
his
body
and
by
bending
his
elbow
as
much
as
the
contracted
space
would
permit
he
could
draw
it
a
few
inches
at
a
time
finally
it
was
altogether
loosened
from
the
wreckage
covering
his
legs
he
could
lift
it
clear
of
the
ground
its
whole
length
a
great
hope
came
into
his
mind
perhaps
he
could
work
it
upward
that
is
to
say
backward
far
enough
to
lift
the
end
and
push
aside
the
rifle
or
if
that
were
too
tightly
wedged
so
place
the
strip
of
board
as
to
deflect
the
bullet
with
this
object
he
passed
it
backward
inch
by
inch
hardly
daring
to
breathe
lest
that
act
somehow
defeat
his
intent
and
more
than
ever
unable
to
remove
his
eyes
from
the
rifle
which
might
perhaps
now
hasten
to
improve
its
waning
opportunity
something
at
least
had
been
gained
in
the
occupation
of
his
mind
in
this
attempt
at
self-defense
he
was
less
sensible
of
the
pain
in
his
head
and
had
ceased
to
wince
but
he
was
still
dreadfully
frightened
and
his
teeth
rattled
like
castanets
the
strip
of
board
ceased
to
move
to
the
suasion
of
his
hand
he
tugged
at
it
with
all
his
strength
changed
the
direction
of
its
length
all
he
could
but
it
had
met
some
extended
obstruction
behind
him
and
the
end
in
front
was
still
too
far
away
to
clear
the
pile
of
dã©bris
and
reach
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
it
extended
indeed
nearly
as
far
as
the
trigger
guard
which
uncovered
by
the
rubbish
he
could
imperfectly
see
with
his
right
eye
he
tried
to
break
the
strip
with
his
hand
but
had
no
leverage
in
his
defeat
all
his
terror
returned
augmented
tenfold
the
black
aperture
of
the
rifle
appeared
to
threaten
a
sharper
and
more
imminent
death
in
punishment
of
his
rebellion
the
track
of
the
bullet
through
his
head
ached
with
an
intenser
anguish
he
began
to
tremble
again
suddenly
he
became
composed
his
tremor
subsided
he
clenched
his
teeth
and
drew
down
his
eyebrows
he
had
not
exhausted
his
means
of
defense
a
new
design
had
shaped
itself
in
his
mind--another
plan
of
battle
raising
the
front
end
of
the
strip
of
board
he
carefully
pushed
it
forward
through
the
wreckage
at
the
side
of
the
rifle
until
it
pressed
against
the
trigger
guard
then
he
moved
the
end
slowly
outward
until
he
could
feel
that
it
had
cleared
it
then
closing
his
eyes
thrust
it
against
the
trigger
with
all
his
strength
there
was
no
explosion
the
rifle
had
been
discharged
as
it
dropped
from
his
hand
when
the
building
fell
but
it
did
its
work





lieutenant
adrian
searing
in
command
of
the
picket-guard
on
that
part
of
the
line
through
which
his
brother
jerome
had
passed
on
his
mission
sat
with
attentive
ears
in
his
breastwork
behind
the
line
not
the
faintest
sound
escaped
him
the
cry
of
a
bird
the
barking
of
a
squirrel
the
noise
of
the
wind
among
the
pines--all
were
anxiously
noted
by
his
overstrained
sense
suddenly
directly
in
front
of
his
line
he
heard
a
faint
confused
rumble
like
the
clatter
of
a
falling
building
translated
by
distance
the
lieutenant
mechanically
looked
at
his
watch
six
o'clock
and
eighteen
minutes
at
the
same
moment
an
officer
approached
him
on
foot
from
the
rear
and
saluted
lieutenant
said
the
officer
the
colonel
directs
you
to
move
forward
your
line
and
feel
the
enemy
if
you
find
him
if
not
continue
the
advance
until
directed
to
halt
there
is
reason
to
think
that
the
enemy
has
retreated
the
lieutenant
nodded
and
said
nothing
the
other
officer
retired
in
a
moment
the
men
apprised
of
their
duty
by
the
non-commissioned
officers
in
low
tones
had
deployed
from
their
rifle-pits
and
were
moving
forward
in
skirmishing
order
with
set
teeth
and
beating
hearts
this
line
of
skirmishers
sweeps
across
the
plantation
toward
the
mountain
they
pass
on
both
sides
of
the
wrecked
building
observing
nothing
at
a
short
distance
in
their
rear
their
commander
comes
he
casts
his
eyes
curiously
upon
the
ruin
and
sees
a
dead
body
half
buried
in
boards
and
timbers
it
is
so
covered
with
dust
that
its
clothing
is
confederate
gray
its
face
is
yellowish
white
the
cheeks
are
fallen
in
the
temples
sunken
too
with
sharp
ridges
about
them
making
the
forehead
forbiddingly
narrow
the
upper
lip
slightly
lifted
shows
the
white
teeth
rigidly
clenched
the
hair
is
heavy
with
moisture
the
face
as
wet
as
the
dewy
grass
all
about
from
his
point
of
view
the
officer
does
not
observe
the
rifle
the
man
was
apparently
killed
by
the
fall
of
the
building
dead
a
week
said
the
officer
curtly
moving
on
and
absently
pulling
out
his
watch
as
if
to
verify
his
estimate
of
time
six
o'clock
and
forty
minutes
killed
at
resaca
the
best
soldier
of
our
staff
was
lieutenant
herman
brayle
one
of
the
two
aides-de-camp
i
don't
remember
where
the
general
picked
him
up
from
some
ohio
regiment
i
think
none
of
us
had
previously
known
him
and
it
would
have
been
strange
if
we
had
for
no
two
of
us
came
from
the
same
state
nor
even
from
adjoining
states
the
general
seemed
to
think
that
a
position
on
his
staff
was
a
distinction
that
should
be
so
judiciously
conferred
as
not
to
beget
any
sectional
jealousies
and
imperil
the
integrity
of
that
part
of
the
country
which
was
still
an
integer
he
would
not
even
choose
officers
from
his
own
command
but
by
some
jugglery
at
department
headquarters
obtained
them
from
other
brigades
under
such
circumstances
a
man's
services
had
to
be
very
distinguished
indeed
to
be
heard
of
by
his
family
and
the
friends
of
his
youth
and
the
speaking
trump
of
fame
was
a
trifle
hoarse
from
loquacity
anyhow
lieutenant
brayle
was
more
than
six
feet
in
height
and
of
splendid
proportions
with
the
light
hair
and
gray-blue
eyes
which
men
so
gifted
usually
find
associated
with
a
high
order
of
courage
as
he
was
commonly
in
full
uniform
especially
in
action
when
most
officers
are
content
to
be
less
flamboyantly
attired
he
was
a
very
striking
and
conspicuous
figure
as
to
the
rest
he
had
a
gentleman's
manners
a
scholar's
head
and
a
lion's
heart
his
age
was
about
thirty
we
all
soon
came
to
like
brayle
as
much
as
we
admired
him
and
it
was
with
sincere
concern
that
in
the
engagement
at
stone's
river--our
first
action
after
he
joined
us--we
observed
that
he
had
one
most
objectionable
and
unsoldierly
quality
he
was
vain
of
his
courage
during
all
the
vicissitudes
and
mutations
of
that
hideous
encounter
whether
our
troops
were
fighting
in
the
open
cotton
fields
in
the
cedar
thickets
or
behind
the
railway
embankment
he
did
not
once
take
cover
except
when
sternly
commanded
to
do
so
by
the
general
who
usually
had
other
things
to
think
of
than
the
lives
of
his
staff
officers--or
those
of
his
men
for
that
matter
in
every
later
engagement
while
brayle
was
with
us
it
was
the
same
way
he
would
sit
his
horse
like
an
equestrian
statue
in
a
storm
of
bullets
and
grape
in
the
most
exposed
places--wherever
in
fact
duty
requiring
him
to
go
permitted
him
to
remain--when
without
trouble
and
with
distinct
advantage
to
his
reputation
for
common
sense
he
might
have
been
in
such
security
as
is
possible
on
a
battlefield
in
the
brief
intervals
of
personal
inaction
on
foot
from
necessity
or
in
deference
to
his
dismounted
commander
or
associates
his
conduct
was
the
same
he
would
stand
like
a
rock
in
the
open
when
officers
and
men
alike
had
taken
to
cover
while
men
older
in
service
and
years
higher
in
rank
and
of
unquestionable
intrepidity
were
loyally
preserving
behind
the
crest
of
a
hill
lives
infinitely
precious
to
their
country
this
fellow
would
stand
equally
idle
on
the
ridge
facing
in
the
direction
of
the
sharpest
fire
when
battles
are
going
on
in
open
ground
it
frequently
occurs
that
the
opposing
lines
confronting
each
other
within
a
stone's
throw
for
hours
hug
the
earth
as
closely
as
if
they
loved
it
the
line
officers
in
their
proper
places
flatten
themselves
no
less
and
the
field
officers
their
horses
all
killed
or
sent
to
the
rear
crouch
beneath
the
infernal
canopy
of
hissing
lead
and
screaming
iron
without
a
thought
of
personal
dignity
in
such
circumstances
the
life
of
a
staff
officer
of
a
brigade
is
distinctly
not
a
happy
one
mainly
because
of
its
precarious
tenure
and
the
unnerving
alternations
of
emotion
to
which
he
is
exposed
from
a
position
of
that
comparative
security
from
which
a
civilian
would
ascribe
his
escape
to
a
miracle
he
may
be
despatched
with
an
order
to
some
commander
of
a
prone
regiment
in
the
front
line--a
person
for
the
moment
inconspicuous
and
not
always
easy
to
find
without
a
deal
of
search
among
men
somewhat
preoccupied
and
in
a
din
in
which
question
and
answer
alike
must
be
imparted
in
the
sign
language
it
is
customary
in
such
cases
to
duck
the
head
and
scuttle
away
on
a
keen
run
an
object
of
lively
interest
to
some
thousands
of
admiring
marksmen
in
returning
--well
it
is
not
customary
to
return
brayle's
practice
was
different
he
would
consign
his
horse
to
the
care
of
an
orderly--he
loved
his
horse--and
walk
quietly
away
on
his
perilous
errand
with
never
a
stoop
of
the
back
his
splendid
figure
accentuated
by
his
uniform
holding
the
eye
with
a
strange
fascination
we
watched
him
with
suspended
breath
our
hearts
in
our
mouths
on
one
occasion
of
this
kind
indeed
one
of
our
number
an
impetuous
stammerer
was
so
possessed
by
his
emotion
that
he
shouted
at
me
i'll
b-b-bet
you
t-two
d-d-dollars
they
d-drop
him
b-b-before
he
g-gets
to
that
d-d-ditch
i
did
not
accept
the
brutal
wager
i
thought
they
would
let
me
do
justice
to
a
brave
man's
memory
in
all
these
needless
exposures
of
life
there
was
no
visible
bravado
nor
subsequent
narration
in
the
few
instances
when
some
of
us
had
ventured
to
remonstrate
brayle
had
smiled
pleasantly
and
made
some
light
reply
which
however
had
not
encouraged
a
further
pursuit
of
the
subject
once
he
said
captain
if
ever
i
come
to
grief
by
forgetting
your
advice
i
hope
my
last
moments
will
be
cheered
by
the
sound
of
your
beloved
voice
breathing
into
my
ear
the
blessed
words
'i
told
you
so'
we
laughed
at
the
captain--just
why
we
could
probably
not
have
explained--and
that
afternoon
when
he
was
shot
to
rags
from
an
ambuscade
brayle
remained
by
the
body
for
some
time
adjusting
the
limbs
with
needless
care--there
in
the
middle
of
a
road
swept
by
gusts
of
grape
and
canister
it
is
easy
to
condemn
this
kind
of
thing
and
not
very
difficult
to
refrain
from
imitation
but
it
is
impossible
not
to
respect
and
brayle
was
liked
none
the
less
for
the
weakness
which
had
so
heroic
an
expression
we
wished
he
were
not
a
fool
but
he
went
on
that
way
to
the
end
sometimes
hard
hit
but
always
returning
to
duty
about
as
good
as
new
of
course
it
came
at
last
he
who
ignores
the
law
of
probabilities
challenges
an
adversary
that
is
seldom
beaten
it
was
at
resaca
in
georgia
during
the
movement
that
resulted
in
the
taking
of
atlanta
in
front
of
our
brigade
the
enemy's
line
of
earthworks
ran
through
open
fields
along
a
slight
crest
at
each
end
of
this
open
ground
we
were
close
up
to
him
in
the
woods
but
the
clear
ground
we
could
not
hope
to
occupy
until
night
when
darkness
would
enable
us
to
burrow
like
moles
and
throw
up
earth
at
this
point
our
line
was
a
quarter-mile
away
in
the
edge
of
a
wood
roughly
we
formed
a
semicircle
the
enemy's
fortified
line
being
the
chord
of
the
arc
lieutenant
go
tell
colonel
ward
to
work
up
as
close
as
he
can
get
cover
and
not
to
waste
much
ammunition
in
unnecessary
firing
you
may
leave
your
horse
when
the
general
gave
this
direction
we
were
in
the
fringe
of
the
forest
near
the
right
extremity
of
the
arc
colonel
ward
was
at
the
left
the
suggestion
to
leave
the
horse
obviously
enough
meant
that
brayle
was
to
take
the
longer
line
through
the
woods
and
among
the
men
indeed
the
suggestion
was
needless
to
go
by
the
short
route
meant
absolutely
certain
failure
to
deliver
the
message
before
anybody
could
interpose
brayle
had
cantered
lightly
into
the
field
and
the
enemy's
works
were
in
crackling
conflagration
stop
that
damned
fool
shouted
the
general
a
private
of
the
escort
with
more
ambition
than
brains
spurred
forward
to
obey
and
within
ten
yards
left
himself
and
his
horse
dead
on
the
field
of
honor
brayle
was
beyond
recall
galloping
easily
along
parallel
to
the
enemy
and
less
than
two
hundred
yards
distant
he
was
a
picture
to
see
his
hat
had
been
blown
or
shot
from
his
head
and
his
long
blond
hair
rose
and
fell
with
the
motion
of
his
horse
he
sat
erect
in
the
saddle
holding
the
reins
lightly
in
his
left
hand
his
right
hanging
carelessly
at
his
side
an
occasional
glimpse
of
his
handsome
profile
as
he
turned
his
head
one
way
or
the
other
proved
that
the
interest
which
he
took
in
what
was
going
on
was
natural
and
without
affectation
the
picture
was
intensely
dramatic
but
in
no
degree
theatrical
successive
scores
of
rifles
spat
at
him
viciously
as
he
came
within
range
and
our
own
line
in
the
edge
of
the
timber
broke
out
in
visible
and
audible
defense
no
longer
regardful
of
themselves
or
their
orders
our
fellows
sprang
to
their
feet
and
swarming
into
the
open
sent
broad
sheets
of
bullets
against
the
blazing
crest
of
the
offending
works
which
poured
an
answering
fire
into
their
unprotected
groups
with
deadly
effect
the
artillery
on
both
sides
joined
the
battle
punctuating
the
rattle
and
roar
with
deep
earth-shaking
explosions
and
tearing
the
air
with
storms
of
screaming
grape
which
from
the
enemy's
side
splintered
the
trees
and
spattered
them
with
blood
and
from
ours
defiled
the
smoke
of
his
arms
with
banks
and
clouds
of
dust
from
his
parapet
my
attention
had
been
for
a
moment
drawn
to
the
general
combat
but
now
glancing
down
the
unobscured
avenue
between
these
two
thunderclouds
i
saw
brayle
the
cause
of
the
carnage
invisible
now
from
either
side
and
equally
doomed
by
friend
and
foe
he
stood
in
the
shot-swept
space
motionless
his
face
toward
the
enemy
at
some
little
distance
lay
his
horse
i
instantly
saw
what
had
stopped
him
as
topographical
engineer
i
had
early
in
the
day
made
a
hasty
examination
of
the
ground
and
now
remembered
that
at
that
point
was
a
deep
and
sinuous
gully
crossing
half
the
field
from
the
enemy's
line
its
general
course
at
right
angles
to
it
from
where
we
now
were
it
was
invisible
and
brayle
had
evidently
not
known
about
it
clearly
it
was
impassable
its
salient
angles
would
have
afforded
him
absolute
security
if
he
had
chosen
to
be
satisfied
with
the
miracle
already
wrought
in
his
favor
and
leapt
into
it
he
could
not
go
forward
he
would
not
turn
back
he
stood
awaiting
death
it
did
not
keep
him
long
waiting
by
some
mysterious
coincidence
almost
instantaneously
as
he
fell
the
firing
ceased
a
few
desultory
shots
at
long
intervals
serving
rather
to
accentuate
than
break
the
silence
it
was
as
if
both
sides
had
suddenly
repented
of
their
profitless
crime
four
stretcher-bearers
of
ours
following
a
sergeant
with
a
white
flag
soon
afterward
moved
unmolested
into
the
field
and
made
straight
for
brayle's
body
several
confederate
officers
and
men
came
out
to
meet
them
and
with
uncovered
heads
assisted
them
to
take
up
their
sacred
burden
as
it
was
borne
toward
us
we
heard
beyond
the
hostile
works
fifes
and
a
muffled
drum--a
dirge
a
generous
enemy
honored
the
fallen
brave
amongst
the
dead
man's
effects
was
a
soiled
russia-leather
pocketbook
in
the
distribution
of
mementoes
of
our
friend
which
the
general
as
administrator
decreed
this
fell
to
me
a
year
after
the
close
of
the
war
on
my
way
to
california
i
opened
and
idly
inspected
it
out
of
an
overlooked
compartment
fell
a
letter
without
envelope
or
address
it
was
in
a
woman's
handwriting
and
began
with
words
of
endearment
but
no
name
it
had
the
following
date
line
san
francisco
cal
july
9
1862
the
signature
was
darling
in
marks
of
quotation
incidentally
in
the
body
of
the
text
the
writer's
full
name
was
given--marian
mendenhall
the
letter
showed
evidence
of
cultivation
and
good
breeding
but
it
was
an
ordinary
love
letter
if
a
love
letter
can
be
ordinary
there
was
not
much
in
it
but
there
was
something
it
was
this
mr
winters
whom
i
shall
always
hate
for
it
has
been
telling
that
at
some
battle
in
virginia
where
he
got
his
hurt
you
were
seen
crouching
behind
a
tree
i
think
he
wants
to
injure
you
in
my
regard
which
he
knows
the
story
would
do
if
i
believed
it
i
could
bear
to
hear
of
my
soldier
lover's
death
but
not
of
his
cowardice
these
were
the
words
which
on
that
sunny
afternoon
in
a
distant
region
had
slain
a
hundred
men
is
woman
weak
one
evening
i
called
on
miss
mendenhall
to
return
the
letter
to
her
i
intended
also
to
tell
her
what
she
had
done--but
not
that
she
did
it
i
found
her
in
a
handsome
dwelling
on
rincon
hill
she
was
beautiful
well
bred--in
a
word
charming
you
knew
lieutenant
herman
brayle
i
said
rather
abruptly
you
know
doubtless
that
he
fell
in
battle
among
his
effects
was
found
this
letter
from
you
my
errand
here
is
to
place
it
in
your
hands
she
mechanically
took
the
letter
glanced
through
it
with
deepening
color
and
then
looking
at
me
with
a
smile
said
it
is
very
good
of
you
though
i
am
sure
it
was
hardly
worth
while
she
started
suddenly
and
changed
color
this
stain
she
said
is
it--
surely
it
is
not--
madam
i
said
pardon
me
but
that
is
the
blood
of
the
truest
and
bravest
heart
that
ever
beat
she
hastily
flung
the
letter
on
the
blazing
coals
uh
i
cannot
bear
the
sight
of
blood
she
said
how
did
he
die
i
had
involuntarily
risen
to
rescue
that
scrap
of
paper
sacred
even
to
me
and
now
stood
partly
behind
her
as
she
asked
the
question
she
turned
her
face
about
and
slightly
upward
the
light
of
the
burning
letter
was
reflected
in
her
eyes
and
touched
her
cheek
with
a
tinge
of
crimson
like
the
stain
upon
its
page
i
had
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
as
this
detestable
creature
he
was
bitten
by
a
snake
i
replied
the
affair
at
coulter's
notch
do
you
think
colonel
that
your
brave
coulter
would
like
to
put
one
of
his
guns
in
here
the
general
asked
he
was
apparently
not
altogether
serious
it
certainly
did
not
seem
a
place
where
any
artillerist
however
brave
would
like
to
put
a
gun
the
colonel
thought
that
possibly
his
division
commander
meant
good-humoredly
to
intimate
that
in
a
recent
conversation
between
them
captain
coulter's
courage
had
been
too
highly
extolled
general
he
replied
warmly
coulter
would
like
to
put
a
gun
anywhere
within
reach
of
those
people
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
enemy
it
is
the
only
place
said
the
general
he
was
serious
then
the
place
was
a
depression
a
notch
in
the
sharp
crest
of
a
hill
it
was
a
pass
and
through
it
ran
a
turnpike
which
reaching
this
highest
point
in
its
course
by
a
sinuous
ascent
through
a
thin
forest
made
a
similar
though
less
steep
descent
toward
the
enemy
for
a
mile
to
the
left
and
a
mile
to
the
right
the
ridge
though
occupied
by
federal
infantry
lying
close
behind
the
sharp
crest
and
appearing
as
if
held
in
place
by
atmospheric
pressure
was
inaccessible
to
artillery
there
was
no
place
but
the
bottom
of
the
notch
and
that
was
barely
wide
enough
for
the
roadbed
from
the
confederate
side
this
point
was
commanded
by
two
batteries
posted
on
a
slightly
lower
elevation
beyond
a
creek
and
a
half-mile
away
all
the
guns
but
one
were
masked
by
the
trees
of
an
orchard
that
one--it
seemed
a
bit
of
impudence--was
on
an
open
lawn
directly
in
front
of
a
rather
grandiose
building
the
planter's
dwelling
the
gun
was
safe
enough
in
its
exposure--but
only
because
the
federal
infantry
had
been
forbidden
to
fire
coulter's
notch--it
came
to
be
called
so--was
not
that
pleasant
summer
afternoon
a
place
where
one
would
like
to
put
a
gun
three
or
four
dead
horses
lay
there
sprawling
in
the
road
three
or
four
dead
men
in
a
trim
row
at
one
side
of
it
and
a
little
back
down
the
hill
all
but
one
were
cavalrymen
belonging
to
the
federal
advance
one
was
a
quartermaster
the
general
commanding
the
division
and
the
colonel
commanding
the
brigade
with
their
staffs
and
escorts
had
ridden
into
the
notch
to
have
a
look
at
the
enemy's
guns--which
had
straightway
obscured
themselves
in
towering
clouds
of
smoke
it
was
hardly
profitable
to
be
curious
about
guns
which
had
the
trick
of
the
cuttle-fish
and
the
season
of
observation
had
been
brief
at
its
conclusion--a
short
remove
backward
from
where
it
began--occurred
the
conversation
already
partly
reported
it
is
the
only
place
the
general
repeated
thoughtfully
to
get
at
them
the
colonel
looked
at
him
gravely
there
is
room
for
only
one
gun
general--one
against
twelve
that
is
true--for
only
one
at
a
time
said
the
commander
with
something
like
yet
not
altogether
like
a
smile
but
then
your
brave
coulter--a
whole
battery
in
himself
the
tone
of
irony
was
now
unmistakable
it
angered
the
colonel
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
the
spirit
of
military
subordination
is
not
favorable
to
retort
nor
even
to
deprecation
at
this
moment
a
young
officer
of
artillery
came
riding
slowly
up
the
road
attended
by
his
bugler
it
was
captain
coulter
he
could
not
have
been
more
than
twenty-three
years
of
age
he
was
of
medium
height
but
very
slender
and
lithe
and
sat
his
horse
with
something
of
the
air
of
a
civilian
in
face
he
was
of
a
type
singularly
unlike
the
men
about
him
thin
high-nosed
gray-eyed
with
a
slight
blond
mustache
and
long
rather
straggling
hair
of
the
same
color
there
was
an
apparent
negligence
in
his
attire
his
cap
was
worn
with
the
visor
a
trifle
askew
his
coat
was
buttoned
only
at
the
sword-belt
showing
a
considerable
expanse
of
white
shirt
tolerably
clean
for
that
stage
of
the
campaign
but
the
negligence
was
all
in
his
dress
and
bearing
in
his
face
was
a
look
of
intense
interest
in
his
surroundings
his
gray
eyes
which
seemed
occasionally
to
strike
right
and
left
across
the
landscape
like
search-lights
were
for
the
most
part
fixed
upon
the
sky
beyond
the
notch
until
he
should
arrive
at
the
summit
of
the
road
there
was
nothing
else
in
that
direction
to
see
as
he
came
opposite
his
division
and
brigade
commanders
at
the
road-side
he
saluted
mechanically
and
was
about
to
pass
on
the
colonel
signed
to
him
to
halt
captain
coulter
he
said
the
enemy
has
twelve
pieces
over
there
on
the
next
ridge
if
i
rightly
understand
the
general
he
directs
that
you
bring
up
a
gun
and
engage
them
there
was
a
blank
silence
the
general
looked
stolidly
at
a
distant
regiment
swarming
slowly
up
the
hill
through
rough
undergrowth
like
a
torn
and
draggled
cloud
of
blue
smoke
the
captain
appeared
not
to
have
observed
him
presently
the
captain
spoke
slowly
and
with
apparent
effort
on
the
next
ridge
did
you
say
sir
are
the
guns
near
the
house
ah
you
have
been
over
this
road
before
directly
at
the
house
and
it
is--necessary--to
engage
them
the
order
is
imperative
his
voice
was
husky
and
broken
he
was
visibly
paler
the
colonel
was
astonished
and
mortified
he
stole
a
glance
at
the
commander
in
that
set
immobile
face
was
no
sign
it
was
as
hard
as
bronze
a
moment
later
the
general
rode
away
followed
by
his
staff
and
escort
the
colonel
humiliated
and
indignant
was
about
to
order
captain
coulter
in
arrest
when
the
latter
spoke
a
few
words
in
a
low
tone
to
his
bugler
saluted
and
rode
straight
forward
into
the
notch
where
presently
at
the
summit
of
the
road
his
field-glass
at
his
eyes
he
showed
against
the
sky
he
and
his
horse
sharply
defined
and
statuesque
the
bugler
had
dashed
down
the
speed
and
disappeared
behind
a
wood
presently
his
bugle
was
heard
singing
in
the
cedars
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
a
single
gun
with
its
caisson
each
drawn
by
six
horses
and
manned
by
its
full
complement
of
gunners
came
bounding
and
banging
up
the
grade
in
a
storm
of
dust
unlimbered
under
cover
and
was
run
forward
by
hand
to
the
fatal
crest
among
the
dead
horses
a
gesture
of
the
captain's
arm
some
strangely
agile
movements
of
the
men
in
loading
and
almost
before
the
troops
along
the
way
had
ceased
to
hear
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
a
great
white
cloud
sprang
forward
down
the
slope
and
with
a
deafening
report
the
affair
at
coulter's
notch
had
begun
it
is
not
intended
to
relate
in
detail
the
progress
and
incidents
of
that
ghastly
contest--a
contest
without
vicissitudes
its
alternations
only
different
degrees
of
despair
almost
at
the
instant
when
captain
coulter's
gun
blew
its
challenging
cloud
twelve
answering
clouds
rolled
upward
from
among
the
trees
about
the
plantation
house
a
deep
multiple
report
roared
back
like
a
broken
echo
and
thenceforth
to
the
end
the
federal
cannoneers
fought
their
hopeless
battle
in
an
atmosphere
of
living
iron
whose
thoughts
were
lightnings
and
whose
deeds
were
death
unwilling
to
see
the
efforts
which
he
could
not
aid
and
the
slaughter
which
he
could
not
stay
the
colonel
ascended
the
ridge
at
a
point
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
left
whence
the
notch
itself
invisible
but
pushing
up
successive
masses
of
smoke
seemed
the
crater
of
a
volcano
in
thundering
eruption
with
his
glass
he
watched
the
enemy's
guns
noting
as
he
could
the
effects
of
coulter's
fire--if
coulter
still
lived
to
direct
it
he
saw
that
the
federal
gunners
ignoring
those
of
the
enemy's
pieces
whose
positions
could
be
determined
by
their
smoke
only
gave
their
whole
attention
to
the
one
that
maintained
its
place
in
the
open--the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
over
and
about
that
hardy
piece
the
shells
exploded
at
intervals
of
a
few
seconds
some
exploded
in
the
house
as
could
be
seen
by
thin
ascensions
of
smoke
from
the
breached
roof
figures
of
prostrate
men
and
horses
were
plainly
visible
if
our
fellows
are
doing
so
good
work
with
a
single
gun
said
the
colonel
to
an
aide
who
happened
to
be
nearest
they
must
be
suffering
like
the
devil
from
twelve
go
down
and
present
the
commander
of
that
piece
with
my
congratulations
on
the
accuracy
of
his
fire
turning
to
his
adjutant-general
he
said
did
you
observe
coulter's
damned
reluctance
to
obey
orders
yes
sir
i
did
well
say
nothing
about
it
please
i
don't
think
the
general
will
care
to
make
any
accusations
he
will
probably
have
enough
to
do
in
explaining
his
own
connection
with
this
uncommon
way
of
amusing
the
rear-guard
of
a
retreating
enemy
a
young
officer
approached
from
below
climbing
breathless
up
the
acclivity
almost
before
he
had
saluted
he
gasped
out
colonel
i
am
directed
by
colonel
harmon
to
say
that
the
enemy's
guns
are
within
easy
reach
of
our
rifles
and
most
of
them
visible
from
several
points
along
the
ridge
the
brigade
commander
looked
at
him
without
a
trace
of
interest
in
his
expression
i
know
it
he
said
quietly
the
young
adjutant
was
visibly
embarrassed
colonel
harmon
would
like
to
have
permission
to
silence
those
guns
he
stammered
so
should
i
the
colonel
said
in
the
same
tone
present
my
compliments
to
colonel
harmon
and
say
to
him
that
the
general's
orders
for
the
infantry
not
to
fire
are
still
in
force
the
adjutant
saluted
and
retired
the
colonel
ground
his
heel
into
the
earth
and
turned
to
look
again
at
the
enemy's
guns
colonel
said
the
adjutant-general
i
don't
know
that
i
ought
to
say
anything
but
there
is
something
wrong
in
all
this
do
you
happen
to
know
that
captain
coulter
is
from
the
south
no
was
he
indeed
i
heard
that
last
summer
the
division
which
the
general
then
commanded
was
in
the
vicinity
of
coulter's
home--camped
there
for
weeks
and--
listen
said
the
colonel
interrupting
with
an
upward
gesture
do
you
hear
that
that
was
the
silence
of
the
federal
gun
the
staff
the
orderlies
the
lines
of
infantry
behind
the
crest--all
had
heard
and
were
looking
curiously
in
the
direction
of
the
crater
whence
no
smoke
now
ascended
except
desultory
cloudlets
from
the
enemy's
shells
then
came
the
blare
of
a
bugle
a
faint
rattle
of
wheels
a
minute
later
the
sharp
reports
recommenced
with
double
activity
the
demolished
gun
had
been
replaced
with
a
sound
one
yes
said
the
adjutant-general
resuming
his
narrative
the
general
made
the
acquaintance
of
coulter's
family
there
was
trouble--i
don't
know
the
exact
nature
of
it--something
about
coulter's
wife
she
is
a
red-hot
secessionist
as
they
all
are
except
coulter
himself
but
she
is
a
good
wife
and
high-bred
lady
there
was
a
complaint
to
army
headquarters
the
general
was
transferred
to
this
division
it
is
odd
that
coulter's
battery
should
afterward
have
been
assigned
to
it
the
colonel
had
risen
from
the
rock
upon
which
they
had
been
sitting
his
eyes
were
blazing
with
a
generous
indignation
see
here
morrison
said
he
looking
his
gossiping
staff
officer
straight
in
the
face
did
you
get
that
story
from
a
gentleman
or
a
liar
i
don't
want
to
say
how
i
got
it
colonel
unless
it
is
necessary--he
was
blushing
a
trifle--but
i'll
stake
my
life
upon
its
truth
in
the
main
the
colonel
turned
toward
a
small
knot
of
officers
some
distance
away
lieutenant
williams
he
shouted
one
of
the
officers
detached
himself
from
the
group
and
coming
forward
saluted
saying
pardon
me
colonel
i
thought
you
had
been
informed
williams
is
dead
down
there
by
the
gun
what
can
i
do
sir
lieutenant
williams
was
the
aide
who
had
had
the
pleasure
of
conveying
to
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
gun
his
brigade
commander's
congratulations
go
said
the
colonel
and
direct
the
withdrawal
of
that
gun
instantly
no--i'll
go
myself
he
strode
down
the
declivity
toward
the
rear
of
the
notch
at
a
break-neck
pace
over
rocks
and
through
brambles
followed
by
his
little
retinue
in
tumultuous
disorder
at
the
foot
of
the
declivity
they
mounted
their
waiting
animals
and
took
to
the
road
at
a
lively
trot
round
a
bend
and
into
the
notch
the
spectacle
which
they
encountered
there
was
appalling
within
that
defile
barely
broad
enough
for
a
single
gun
were
piled
the
wrecks
of
no
fewer
than
four
they
had
noted
the
silencing
of
only
the
last
one
disabled--there
had
been
a
lack
of
men
to
replace
it
quickly
with
another
the
dã©bris
lay
on
both
sides
of
the
road
the
men
had
managed
to
keep
an
open
way
between
through
which
the
fifth
piece
was
now
firing
the
men--they
looked
like
demons
of
the
pit
all
were
hatless
all
stripped
to
the
waist
their
reeking
skins
black
with
blotches
of
powder
and
spattered
with
gouts
of
blood
they
worked
like
madmen
with
rammer
and
cartridge
lever
and
lanyard
they
set
their
swollen
shoulders
and
bleeding
hands
against
the
wheels
at
each
recoil
and
heaved
the
heavy
gun
back
to
its
place
there
were
no
commands
in
that
awful
environment
of
whooping
shot
exploding
shells
shrieking
fragments
of
iron
and
flying
splinters
of
wood
none
could
have
been
heard
officers
if
officers
there
were
were
indistinguishable
all
worked
together--each
while
he
lasted--governed
by
the
eye
when
the
gun
was
sponged
it
was
loaded
when
loaded
aimed
and
fired
the
colonel
observed
something
new
to
his
military
experience--something
horrible
and
unnatural
the
gun
was
bleeding
at
the
mouth
in
temporary
default
of
water
the
man
sponging
had
dipped
his
sponge
into
a
pool
of
comrade's
blood
in
all
this
work
there
was
no
clashing
the
duty
of
the
instant
was
obvious
when
one
fell
another
looking
a
trifle
cleaner
seemed
to
rise
from
the
earth
in
the
dead
man's
tracks
to
fall
in
his
turn
with
the
ruined
guns
lay
the
ruined
men--alongside
the
wreckage
under
it
and
atop
of
it
and
back
down
the
road--a
ghastly
procession--crept
on
hands
and
knees
such
of
the
wounded
as
were
able
to
move
the
colonel--he
had
compassionately
sent
his
cavalcade
to
the
right
about--
had
to
ride
over
those
who
were
entirely
dead
in
order
not
to
crush
those
who
were
partly
alive
into
that
hell
he
tranquilly
held
his
way
rode
up
alongside
the
gun
and
in
the
obscurity
of
the
last
discharge
tapped
upon
the
cheek
the
man
holding
the
rammer--who
straightway
fell
thinking
himself
killed
a
fiend
seven
times
damned
sprang
out
of
the
smoke
to
take
his
place
but
paused
and
gazed
up
at
the
mounted
officer
with
an
unearthly
regard
his
teeth
flashing
between
his
black
lips
his
eyes
fierce
and
expanded
burning
like
coals
beneath
his
bloody
brow
the
colonel
made
an
authoritative
gesture
and
pointed
to
the
rear
the
fiend
bowed
in
token
of
obedience
it
was
captain
coulter
simultaneously
with
the
colonel's
arresting
sign
silence
fell
upon
the
whole
field
of
action
the
procession
of
missiles
no
longer
streamed
into
that
defile
of
death
for
the
enemy
also
had
ceased
firing
his
army
had
been
gone
for
hours
and
the
commander
of
his
rear-guard
who
had
held
his
position
perilously
long
in
hope
to
silence
the
federal
fire
at
that
strange
moment
had
silenced
his
own
i
was
not
aware
of
the
breadth
of
my
authority
said
the
colonel
to
anybody
riding
forward
to
the
crest
to
see
what
had
really
happened
an
hour
later
his
brigade
was
in
bivouac
on
the
enemy's
ground
and
its
idlers
were
examining
with
something
of
awe
as
the
faithful
inspect
a
saint's
relics
a
score
of
straddling
dead
horses
and
three
disabled
guns
all
spiked
the
fallen
men
had
been
carried
away
their
torn
and
broken
bodies
would
have
given
too
great
satisfaction
naturally
the
colonel
established
himself
and
his
military
family
in
the
plantation
house
it
was
somewhat
shattered
but
it
was
better
than
the
open
air
the
furniture
was
greatly
deranged
and
broken
walls
and
ceilings
were
knocked
away
here
and
there
and
a
lingering
odor
of
powder
smoke
was
everywhere
the
beds
the
closets
of
women's
clothing
the
cupboards
were
not
greatly
damaged
the
new
tenants
for
a
night
made
themselves
comfortable
and
the
virtual
effacement
of
coulter's
battery
supplied
them
with
an
interesting
topic
during
supper
an
orderly
of
the
escort
showed
himself
into
the
dining-room
and
asked
permission
to
speak
to
the
colonel
what
is
it
barbour
said
that
officer
pleasantly
having
overheard
the
request
colonel
there
is
something
wrong
in
the
cellar
i
don't
know
what--
somebody
there
i
was
down
there
rummaging
about
i
will
go
down
and
see
said
a
staff
officer
rising
so
will
i
the
colonel
said
let
the
others
remain
lead
on
orderly
they
took
a
candle
from
the
table
and
descended
the
cellar
stairs
the
orderly
in
visible
trepidation
the
candle
made
but
a
feeble
light
but
presently
as
they
advanced
its
narrow
circle
of
illumination
revealed
a
human
figure
seated
on
the
ground
against
the
black
stone
wall
which
they
were
skirting
its
knees
elevated
its
head
bowed
sharply
forward
the
face
which
should
have
been
seen
in
profile
was
invisible
for
the
man
was
bent
so
far
forward
that
his
long
hair
concealed
it
and
strange
to
relate
the
beard
of
a
much
darker
hue
fell
in
a
great
tangled
mass
and
lay
along
the
ground
at
his
side
they
involuntarily
paused
then
the
colonel
taking
the
candle
from
the
orderly's
shaking
hand
approached
the
man
and
attentively
considered
him
the
long
dark
beard
was
the
hair
of
a
woman--dead
the
dead
woman
clasped
in
her
arms
a
dead
babe
both
were
clasped
in
the
arms
of
the
man
pressed
against
his
breast
against
his
lips
there
was
blood
in
the
hair
of
the
woman
there
was
blood
in
the
hair
of
the
man
a
yard
away
near
an
irregular
depression
in
the
beaten
earth
which
formed
the
cellar's
floor--fresh
excavation
with
a
convex
bit
of
iron
having
jagged
edges
visible
in
one
of
the
sides--lay
an
infant's
foot
the
colonel
held
the
light
as
high
as
he
could
the
floor
of
the
room
above
was
broken
through
the
splinters
pointing
at
all
angles
downward
this
casemate
is
not
bomb-proof
said
the
colonel
gravely
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
his
summing
up
of
the
matter
had
any
levity
in
it
they
stood
about
the
group
awhile
in
silence
the
staff
officer
was
thinking
of
his
unfinished
supper
the
orderly
of
what
might
possibly
be
in
one
of
the
casks
on
the
other
side
of
the
cellar
suddenly
the
man
whom
they
had
thought
dead
raised
his
head
and
gazed
tranquilly
into
their
faces
his
complexion
was
coal
black
the
cheeks
were
apparently
tattooed
in
irregular
sinuous
lines
from
the
eyes
downward
the
lips
too
were
white
like
those
of
a
stage
negro
there
was
blood
upon
his
forehead
the
staff
officer
drew
back
a
pace
the
orderly
two
paces
what
are
you
doing
here
my
man
said
the
colonel
unmoved
this
house
belongs
to
me
sir
was
the
reply
civilly
delivered
to
you
ah
i
see
and
these
my
wife
and
child
i
am
captain
coulter
the
coup
de
grã‚ce
the
fighting
had
been
hard
and
continuous
that
was
attested
by
all
the
senses
the
very
taste
of
battle
was
in
the
air
all
was
now
over
it
remained
only
to
succor
the
wounded
and
bury
the
dead--to
tidy
up
a
bit
as
the
humorist
of
a
burial
squad
put
it
a
good
deal
of
tidying
up
was
required
as
far
as
one
could
see
through
the
forests
among
the
splintered
trees
lay
wrecks
of
men
and
horses
among
them
moved
the
stretcher-bearers
gathering
and
carrying
away
the
few
who
showed
signs
of
life
most
of
the
wounded
had
died
of
neglect
while
the
right
to
minister
to
their
wants
was
in
dispute
it
is
an
army
regulation
that
the
wounded
must
wait
the
best
way
to
care
for
them
is
to
win
the
battle
it
must
be
confessed
that
victory
is
a
distinct
advantage
to
a
man
requiring
attention
but
many
do
not
live
to
avail
themselves
of
it
the
dead
were
collected
in
groups
of
a
dozen
or
a
score
and
laid
side
by
side
in
rows
while
the
trenches
were
dug
to
receive
them
some
found
at
too
great
a
distance
from
these
rallying
points
were
buried
where
they
lay
there
was
little
attempt
at
identification
though
in
most
cases
the
burial
parties
being
detailed
to
glean
the
same
ground
which
they
had
assisted
to
reap
the
names
of
the
victorious
dead
were
known
and
listed
the
enemy's
fallen
had
to
be
content
with
counting
but
of
that
they
got
enough
many
of
them
were
counted
several
times
and
the
total
as
given
afterward
in
the
official
report
of
the
victorious
commander
denoted
rather
a
hope
than
a
result
at
some
little
distance
from
the
spot
where
one
of
the
burial
parties
had
established
its
bivouac
of
the
dead
a
man
in
the
uniform
of
a
federal
officer
stood
leaning
against
a
tree
from
his
feet
upward
to
his
neck
his
attitude
was
that
of
weariness
reposing
but
he
turned
his
head
uneasily
from
side
to
side
his
mind
was
apparently
not
at
rest
he
was
perhaps
uncertain
in
which
direction
to
go
he
was
not
likely
to
remain
long
where
he
was
for
already
the
level
rays
of
the
setting
sun
straggled
redly
through
the
open
spaces
of
the
wood
and
the
weary
soldiers
were
quitting
their
task
for
the
day
he
would
hardly
make
a
night
of
it
alone
there
among
the
dead
nine
men
in
ten
whom
you
meet
after
a
battle
inquire
the
way
to
some
fraction
of
the
army--as
if
any
one
could
know
doubtless
this
officer
was
lost
after
resting
himself
a
moment
he
would
presumably
follow
one
of
the
retiring
burial
squads
when
all
were
gone
he
walked
straight
away
into
the
forest
toward
the
red
west
its
light
staining
his
face
like
blood
the
air
of
confidence
with
which
he
now
strode
along
showed
that
he
was
on
familiar
ground
he
had
recovered
his
bearings
the
dead
on
his
right
and
on
his
left
were
unregarded
as
he
passed
an
occasional
low
moan
from
some
sorely-stricken
wretch
whom
the
relief-parties
had
not
reached
and
who
would
have
to
pass
a
comfortless
night
beneath
the
stars
with
his
thirst
to
keep
him
company
was
equally
unheeded
what
indeed
could
the
officer
have
done
being
no
surgeon
and
having
no
water
at
the
head
of
a
shallow
ravine
a
mere
depression
of
the
ground
lay
a
small
group
of
bodies
he
saw
and
swerving
suddenly
from
his
course
walked
rapidly
toward
them
scanning
each
one
sharply
as
he
passed
he
stopped
at
last
above
one
which
lay
at
a
slight
remove
from
the
others
near
a
clump
of
small
trees
he
looked
at
it
narrowly
it
seemed
to
stir
he
stooped
and
laid
his
hand
upon
its
face
it
screamed





the
officer
was
captain
downing
madwell
of
a
massachusetts
regiment
of
infantry
a
daring
and
intelligent
soldier
an
honorable
man
in
the
regiment
were
two
brothers
named
halcrow--caffal
and
creede
halcrow
caffal
halcrow
was
a
sergeant
in
captain
madwell's
company
and
these
two
men
the
sergeant
and
the
captain
were
devoted
friends
in
so
far
as
disparity
of
rank
difference
in
duties
and
considerations
of
military
discipline
would
permit
they
were
commonly
together
they
had
indeed
grown
up
together
from
childhood
a
habit
of
the
heart
is
not
easily
broken
off
caffal
halcrow
had
nothing
military
in
his
taste
nor
disposition
but
the
thought
of
separation
from
his
friend
was
disagreeable
he
enlisted
in
the
company
in
which
madwell
was
second-lieutenant
each
had
taken
two
steps
upward
in
rank
but
between
the
highest
non-commissioned
and
the
lowest
commissioned
officer
the
gulf
is
deep
and
wide
and
the
old
relation
was
maintained
with
difficulty
and
a
difference
creede
halcrow
the
brother
of
caffal
was
the
major
of
the
regiment--a
cynical
saturnine
man
between
whom
and
captain
madwell
there
was
a
natural
antipathy
which
circumstances
had
nourished
and
strengthened
to
an
active
animosity
but
for
the
restraining
influence
of
their
mutual
relation
to
caffal
these
two
patriots
would
doubtless
have
endeavored
to
deprive
their
country
of
each
other's
services
at
the
opening
of
the
battle
that
morning
the
regiment
was
performing
outpost
duty
a
mile
away
from
the
main
army
it
was
attacked
and
nearly
surrounded
in
the
forest
but
stubbornly
held
its
ground
during
a
lull
in
the
fighting
major
halcrow
came
to
captain
madwell
the
two
exchanged
formal
salutes
and
the
major
said
captain
the
colonel
directs
that
you
push
your
company
to
the
head
of
this
ravine
and
hold
your
place
there
until
recalled
i
need
hardly
apprise
you
of
the
dangerous
character
of
the
movement
but
if
you
wish
you
can
i
suppose
turn
over
the
command
to
your
first-lieutenant
i
was
not
however
directed
to
authorize
the
substitution
it
is
merely
a
suggestion
of
my
own
unofficially
made
to
this
deadly
insult
captain
madwell
coolly
replied
sir
i
invite
you
to
accompany
the
movement
a
mounted
officer
would
be
a
conspicuous
mark
and
i
have
long
held
the
opinion
that
it
would
be
better
if
you
were
dead
the
art
of
repartee
was
cultivated
in
military
circles
as
early
as
1862
a
half-hour
later
captain
madwell's
company
was
driven
from
its
position
at
the
head
of
the
ravine
with
a
loss
of
one-third
its
number
among
the
fallen
was
sergeant
halcrow
the
regiment
was
soon
afterward
forced
back
to
the
main
line
and
at
the
close
of
the
battle
was
miles
away
the
captain
was
now
standing
at
the
side
of
his
subordinate
and
friend
sergeant
halcrow
was
mortally
hurt
his
clothing
was
deranged
it
seemed
to
have
been
violently
torn
apart
exposing
the
abdomen
some
of
the
buttons
of
his
jacket
had
been
pulled
off
and
lay
on
the
ground
beside
him
and
fragments
of
his
other
garments
were
strewn
about
his
leather
belt
was
parted
and
had
apparently
been
dragged
from
beneath
him
as
he
lay
there
had
been
no
great
effusion
of
blood
the
only
visible
wound
was
a
wide
ragged
opening
in
the
abdomen
it
was
defiled
with
earth
and
dead
leaves
protruding
from
it
was
a
loop
of
small
intestine
in
all
his
experience
captain
madwell
had
not
seen
a
wound
like
this
he
could
neither
conjecture
how
it
was
made
nor
explain
the
attendant
circumstances--the
strangely
torn
clothing
the
parted
belt
the
besmirching
of
the
white
skin
he
knelt
and
made
a
closer
examination
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
he
turned
his
eyes
in
different
directions
as
if
looking
for
an
enemy
fifty
yards
away
on
the
crest
of
a
low
thinly
wooded
hill
he
saw
several
dark
objects
moving
about
among
the
fallen
men--a
herd
of
swine
one
stood
with
its
back
to
him
its
shoulders
sharply
elevated
its
forefeet
were
upon
a
human
body
its
head
was
depressed
and
invisible
the
bristly
ridge
of
its
chine
showed
black
against
the
red
west
captain
madwell
drew
away
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
again
upon
the
thing
which
had
been
his
friend
the
man
who
had
suffered
these
monstrous
mutilations
was
alive
at
intervals
he
moved
his
limbs
he
moaned
at
every
breath
he
stared
blankly
into
the
face
of
his
friend
and
if
touched
screamed
in
his
giant
agony
he
had
torn
up
the
ground
on
which
he
lay
his
clenched
hands
were
full
of
leaves
and
twigs
and
earth
articulate
speech
was
beyond
his
power
it
was
impossible
to
know
if
he
were
sensible
to
anything
but
pain
the
expression
of
his
face
was
an
appeal
his
eyes
were
full
of
prayer
for
what
there
was
no
misreading
that
look
the
captain
had
too
frequently
seen
it
in
eyes
of
those
whose
lips
had
still
the
power
to
formulate
it
by
an
entreaty
for
death
consciously
or
unconsciously
this
writhing
fragment
of
humanity
this
type
and
example
of
acute
sensation
this
handiwork
of
man
and
beast
this
humble
unheroic
prometheus
was
imploring
everything
all
the
whole
non-ego
for
the
boon
of
oblivion
to
the
earth
and
the
sky
alike
to
the
trees
to
the
man
to
whatever
took
form
in
sense
or
consciousness
this
incarnate
suffering
addressed
that
silent
plea
for
what
indeed
for
that
which
we
accord
to
even
the
meanest
creature
without
sense
to
demand
it
denying
it
only
to
the
wretched
of
our
own
race
for
the
blessed
release
the
rite
of
uttermost
compassion
the
coup
de
grã¢ce
captain
madwell
spoke
the
name
of
his
friend
he
repeated
it
over
and
over
without
effect
until
emotion
choked
his
utterance
his
tears
plashed
upon
the
livid
face
beneath
his
own
and
blinded
himself
he
saw
nothing
but
a
blurred
and
moving
object
but
the
moans
were
more
distinct
than
ever
interrupted
at
briefer
intervals
by
sharper
shrieks
he
turned
away
struck
his
hand
upon
his
forehead
and
strode
from
the
spot
the
swine
catching
sight
of
him
threw
up
their
crimson
muzzles
regarding
him
suspiciously
a
second
and
then
with
a
gruff
concerted
grunt
raced
away
out
of
sight
a
horse
its
foreleg
splintered
by
a
cannon-shot
lifted
its
head
sidewise
from
the
ground
and
neighed
piteously
madwell
stepped
forward
drew
his
revolver
and
shot
the
poor
beast
between
the
eyes
narrowly
observing
its
death-struggle
which
contrary
to
his
expectation
was
violent
and
long
but
at
last
it
lay
still
the
tense
muscles
of
its
lips
which
had
uncovered
the
teeth
in
a
horrible
grin
relaxed
the
sharp
clean-cut
profile
took
on
a
look
of
profound
peace
and
rest
along
the
distant
thinly
wooded
crest
to
westward
the
fringe
of
sunset
fire
had
now
nearly
burned
itself
out
the
light
upon
the
trunks
of
the
trees
had
faded
to
a
tender
gray
shadows
were
in
their
tops
like
great
dark
birds
aperch
night
was
coming
and
there
were
miles
of
haunted
forest
between
captain
madwell
and
camp
yet
he
stood
there
at
the
side
of
the
dead
animal
apparently
lost
to
all
sense
of
his
surroundings
his
eyes
were
bent
upon
the
earth
at
his
feet
his
left
hand
hung
loosely
at
his
side
his
right
still
held
the
pistol
presently
he
lifted
his
face
turned
it
toward
his
dying
friend
and
walked
rapidly
back
to
his
side
he
knelt
upon
one
knee
cocked
the
weapon
placed
the
muzzle
against
the
man's
forehead
and
turning
away
his
eyes
pulled
the
trigger
there
was
no
report
he
had
used
his
last
cartridge
for
the
horse
the
sufferer
moaned
and
his
lips
moved
convulsively
the
froth
that
ran
from
them
had
a
tinge
of
blood
captain
madwell
rose
to
his
feet
and
drew
his
sword
from
the
scabbard
he
passed
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
along
the
edge
from
hilt
to
point
he
held
it
out
straight
before
him
as
if
to
test
his
nerves
there
was
no
visible
tremor
of
the
blade
the
ray
of
bleak
skylight
that
it
reflected
was
steady
and
true
he
stooped
and
with
his
left
hand
tore
away
the
dying
man's
shirt
rose
and
placed
the
point
of
the
sword
just
over
the
heart
this
time
he
did
not
withdraw
his
eyes
grasping
the
hilt
with
both
hands
he
thrust
downward
with
all
his
strength
and
weight
the
blade
sank
into
the
man's
body--through
his
body
into
the
earth
captain
madwell
came
near
falling
forward
upon
his
work
the
dying
man
drew
up
his
knees
and
at
the
same
time
threw
his
right
arm
across
his
breast
and
grasped
the
steel
so
tightly
that
the
knuckles
of
the
hand
visibly
whitened
by
a
violent
but
vain
effort
to
withdraw
the
blade
the
wound
was
enlarged
a
rill
of
blood
escaped
running
sinuously
down
into
the
deranged
clothing
at
that
moment
three
men
stepped
silently
forward
from
behind
the
clump
of
young
trees
which
had
concealed
their

what

your

am
to
lose
it
at
daylight

it
is
hardly
worth
while
concealing
it
parker
adderson
your
rank
a
somewhat
humble
one
commissioned
officers
are
too
precious
to
be
risked
in
the
perilous
business
of
a
spy
i
am
a
sergeant
of
what
regiment
you
must
excuse
me
my
answer
might
for
anything
i
know
give
you
an
idea
of
whose
forces
are
in
your
front
such
knowledge
as
that
is
what
i
came
into
your
lines
to
obtain
not
to
impart
you
are
not
without
wit
if
you
have
the
patience
to
wait
you
will
find
me
dull
enough
to-morrow
how
do
you
know
that
you
are
to
die
to-morrow
morning
among
spies
captured
by
night
that
is
the
custom
it
is
one
of
the
nice
observances
of
the
profession
the
general
so
far
laid
aside
the
dignity
appropriate
to
a
confederate
officer
of
high
rank
and
wide
renown
as
to
smile
but
no
one
in
his
power
and
out
of
his
favor
would
have
drawn
any
happy
augury
from
that
outward
and
visible
sign
of
approval
it
was
neither
genial
nor
infectious
it
did
not
communicate
itself
to
the
other
persons
exposed
to
it--the
caught
spy
who
had
provoked
it
and
the
armed
guard
who
had
brought
him
into
the
tent
and
now
stood
a
little
apart
watching
his
prisoner
in
the
yellow
candle-light
it
was
no
part
of
that
warrior's
duty
to
smile
he
had
been
detailed
for
another
purpose
the
conversation
was
resumed
it
was
in
character
a
trial
for
a
capital
offense
you
admit
then
that
you
are
a
spy--that
you
came
into
my
camp
disguised
as
you
are
in
the
uniform
of
a
confederate
soldier
to
obtain
information
secretly
regarding
the
numbers
and
disposition
of
my
troops
regarding
particularly
their
numbers
their
disposition
i
already
knew
it
is
morose
the
general
brightened
again
the
guard
with
a
severer
sense
of
his
responsibility
accentuated
the
austerity
of
his
expression
and
stood
a
trifle
more
erect
than
before
twirling
his
gray
slouch
hat
round
and
round
upon
his
forefinger
the
spy
took
a
leisurely
survey
of
his
surroundings
they
were
simple
enough
the
tent
was
a
common
wall
tent
about
eight
feet
by
ten
in
dimensions
lighted
by
a
single
tallow
candle
stuck
into
the
haft
of
a
bayonet
which
was
itself
stuck
into
a
pine
table
at
which
the
general
sat
now
busily
writing
and
apparently
forgetful
of
his
unwilling
guest
an
old
rag
carpet
covered
the
earthen
floor
an
older
leather
trunk
a
second
chair
and
a
roll
of
blankets
were
about
all
else
that
the
tent
contained
in
general
clavering's
command
confederate
simplicity
and
penury
of
pomp
and
circumstance
had
attained
their
highest
development
on
a
large
nail
driven
into
the
tent
pole
at
the
entrance
was
suspended
a
sword-belt
supporting
a
long
sabre
a
pistol
in
its
holster
and
absurdly
enough
a
bowie-knife
of
that
most
unmilitary
weapon
it
was
the
general's
habit
to
explain
that
it
was
a
souvenir
of
the
peaceful
days
when
he
was
a
civilian
it
was
a
stormy
night
the
rain
cascaded
upon
the
canvas
in
torrents
with
the
dull
drum-like
sound
familiar
to
dwellers
in
tents
as
the
whooping
blasts
charged
upon
it
the
frail
structure
shook
and
swayed
and
strained
at
its
confining
stakes
and
ropes
the
general
finished
writing
folded
the
half-sheet
of
paper
and
spoke
to
the
soldier
guarding
adderson
here
tassman
take
that
to
the
adjutant-general
then
return
and
the
prisoner
general
said
the
soldier
saluting
with
an
inquiring
glance
in
the
direction
of
that
unfortunate
do
as
i
said
replied
the
officer
curtly
the
soldier
took
the
note
and
ducked
himself
out
of
the
tent
general
clavering
turned
his
handsome
face
toward
the
federal
spy
looked
him
in
the
eyes
not
unkindly
and
said
it
is
a
bad
night
my
man
for
me
yes
do
you
guess
what
i
have
written
something
worth
reading
i
dare
say
and--perhaps
it
is
my
vanity--i
venture
to
suppose
that
i
am
mentioned
in
it
yes
it
is
a
memorandum
for
an
order
to
be
read
to
the
troops
at
reveille
concerning
your
execution
also
some
notes
for
the
guidance
of
the
provost-marshal
in
arranging
the
details
of
that
event
i
hope
general
the
spectacle
will
be
intelligently
arranged
for
i
shall
attend
it
myself
have
you
any
arrangements
of
your
own
that
you
wish
to
make
do
you
wish
to
see
a
chaplain
for
example
i
could
hardly
secure
a
longer
rest
for
myself
by
depriving
him
of
some
of
his
good
god
man
do
you
mean
to
go
to
your
death
with
nothing
but
jokes
upon
your
lips
do
you
know
that
this
is
a
serious
matter
how
can
i
know
that
i
have
never
been
dead
in
all
my
life
i
have
heard
that
death
is
a
serious
matter
but
never
from
any
of
those
who
have
experienced
it
the
general
was
silent
for
a
moment
the
man
interested
perhaps
amused
him--a
type
not
previously
encountered
death
he
said
is
at
least
a
loss--a
loss
of
such
happiness
as
we
have
and
of
opportunities
for
more
a
loss
of
which
we
shall
never
be
conscious
can
be
borne
with
composure
and
therefore
expected
without
apprehension
you
must
have
observed
general
that
of
all
the
dead
men
with
whom
it
is
your
soldierly
pleasure
to
strew
your
path
none
shows
signs
of
regret
if
the
being
dead
is
not
a
regrettable
condition
yet
the
becoming
so--
the
act
of
dying--appears
to
be
distinctly
disagreeable
to
one
who
has
not
lost
the
power
to
feel
pain
is
disagreeable
no
doubt
i
never
suffer
it
without
more
or
less
discomfort
but
he
who
lives
longest
is
most
exposed
to
it
what
you
call
dying
is
simply
the
last
pain--there
is
really
no
such
thing
as
dying
suppose
for
illustration
that
i
attempt
to
escape
you
lift
the
revolver
that
you
are
courteously
concealing
in
your
lap
and--
the
general
blushed
like
a
girl
then
laughed
softly
disclosing
his
brilliant
teeth
made
a
slight
inclination
of
his
handsome
head
and
said
nothing
the
spy
continued
you
fire
and
i
have
in
my
stomach
what
i
did
not
swallow
i
fall
but
am
not
dead
after
a
half-hour
of
agony
i
am
dead
but
at
any
given
instant
of
that
half-hour
i
was
either
alive
or
dead
there
is
no
transition
period
when
i
am
hanged
to-morrow
morning
it
will
be
quite
the
same
while
conscious
i
shall
be
living
when
dead
unconscious
nature
appears
to
have
ordered
the
matter
quite
in
my
interest--the
way
that
i
should
have
ordered
it
myself
it
is
so
simple
he
added
with
a
smile
that
it
seems
hardly
worth
while
to
be
hanged
at
all
at
the
finish
of
his
remarks
there
was
a
long
silence
the
general
sat
impassive
looking
into
the
man's
face
but
apparently
not
attentive
to
what
had
been
said
it
was
as
if
his
eyes
had
mounted
guard
over
the
prisoner
while
his
mind
concerned
itself
with
other
matters
presently
he
drew
a
long
deep
breath
shuddered
as
one
awakened
from
a
dreadful
dream
and
exclaimed
almost
inaudibly
death
is
horrible--this
man
of
death
it
was
horrible
to
our
savage
ancestors
said
the
spy
gravely
because
they
had
not
enough
intelligence
to
dissociate
the
idea
of
consciousness
from
the
idea
of
the
physical
forms
in
which
it
is
manifested--as
an
even
lower
order
of
intelligence
that
of
the
monkey
for
example
may
be
unable
to
imagine
a
house
without
inhabitants
and
seeing
a
ruined
hut
fancies
a
suffering
occupant
to
us
it
is
horrible
because
we
have
inherited
the
tendency
to
think
it
so
accounting
for
the
notion
by
wild
and
fanciful
theories
of
another
world--as
names
of
places
give
rise
to
legends
explaining
them
and
reasonless
conduct
to
philosophies
in
justification
you
can
hang
me
general
but
there
your
power
of
evil
ends
you
cannot
condemn
me
to
heaven
the
general
appeared
not
to
have
heard
the
spy's
talk
had
merely
turned
his
thoughts
into
an
unfamiliar
channel
but
there
they
pursued
their
will
independently
to
conclusions
of
their
own
the
storm
had
ceased
and
something
of
the
solemn
spirit
of
the
night
had
imparted
itself
to
his
reflections
giving
them
the
sombre
tinge
of
a
supernatural
dread
perhaps
there
was
an
element
of
prescience
in
it
i
should
not
like
to
die
he
said--not
to-night
he
was
interrupted--if
indeed
he
had
intended
to
speak
further--by
the
entrance
of
an
officer
of
his
staff
captain
hasterlick
the
provost-marshal
this
recalled
him
to
himself
the
absent
look
passed
away
from
his
face
captain
he
said
acknowledging
the
officer's
salute
this
man
is
a
yankee
spy
captured
inside
our
lines
with
incriminating
papers
on
him
he
has
confessed
how
is
the
weather
the
storm
is
over
sir
and
the
moon
shining
good
take
a
file
of
men
conduct
him
at
once
to
the
parade
ground
and
shoot
him
a
sharp
cry
broke
from
the
spy's
lips
he
threw
himself
forward
thrust
out
his
neck
expanded
his
eyes
clenched
his
hands
good
god
he
cried
hoarsely
almost
inarticulately
you
do
not
mean
that
you
forget--i
am
not
to
die
until
morning
i
have
said
nothing
of
morning
replied
the
general
coldly
that
was
an
assumption
of
your
own
you
die
now
but
general
i
beg--i
implore
you
to
remember
i
am
to
hang
it
will
take
some
time
to
erect
the
gallows--two
hours--an
hour
spies
are
hanged
i
have
rights
under
military
law
for
heaven's
sake
general
consider
how
short--
captain
observe
my
directions
the
officer
drew
his
sword
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
prisoner
pointed
silently
to
the
opening
of
the
tent
the
prisoner
hesitated
the
officer
grasped
him
by
the
collar
and
pushed
him
gently
forward
as
he
approached
the
tent
pole
the
frantic
man
sprang
to
it
and
with
cat-like
agility
seized
the
handle
of
the
bowie-knife
plucked
the
weapon
from
the
scabbard
and
thrusting
the
captain
aside
leaped
upon
the
general
with
the
fury
of
a
madman
hurling
him
to
the
ground
and
falling
headlong
upon
him
as
he
lay
the
table
was
overturned
the
candle
extinguished
and
they
fought
blindly
in
the
darkness
the
provost-marshal
sprang
to
the
assistance
of
his
superior
officer
and
was
himself
prostrated
upon
the
struggling
forms
curses
and
inarticulate
cries
of
rage
and
pain
came
from
the
welter
of
limbs
and
bodies
the
tent
came
down
upon
them
and
beneath
its
hampering
and
enveloping
folds
the
struggle
went
on
private
tassman
returning
from
his
errand
and
dimly
conjecturing
the
situation
threw
down
his
rifle
and
laying
hold
of
the
flouncing
canvas
at
random
vainly
tried
to
drag
it
off
the
men
under
it
and
the
sentinel
who
paced
up
and
down
in
front
not
daring
to
leave
his
beat
though
the
skies
should
fall
discharged
his
rifle
the
report
alarmed
the
camp
drums
beat
the
long
roll
and
bugles
sounded
the
assembly
bringing
swarms
of
half-clad
men
into
the
moonlight
dressing
as
they
ran
and
falling
into
line
at
the
sharp
commands
of
their
officers
this
was
well
being
in
line
the
men
were
under
control
they
stood
at
arms
while
the
general's
staff
and
the
men
of
his
escort
brought
order
out
of
confusion
by
lifting
off
the
fallen
tent
and
pulling
apart
the
breathless
and
bleeding
actors
in
that
strange
contention
breathless
indeed
was
one
the
captain
was
dead
the
handle
of
the
bowie-knife
protruding
from
his
throat
was
pressed
back
beneath
his
chin
until
the
end
had
caught
in
the
angle
of
the
jaw
and
the
hand
that
delivered
the
blow
had
been
unable
to
remove
the
weapon
in
the
dead
man's
hand
was
his
sword
clenched
with
a
grip
that
defied
the
strength
of
the
living
its
blade
was
streaked
with
red
to
the
hilt
lifted
to
his
feet
the
general
sank
back
to
the
earth
with
a
moan
and
fainted
besides
his
bruises
he
had
two
sword-thrusts--one
through
the
thigh
the
other
through
the
shoulder
the
spy
had
suffered
the
least
damage
apart
from
a
broken
right
arm
his
wounds
were
such
only
as
might
have
been
incurred
in
an
ordinary
combat
with
nature's
weapons
but
he
was
dazed
and
seemed
hardly
to
know
what
had
occurred
he
shrank
away
from
those
attending
him
cowered
upon
the
ground
and
uttered
unintelligible
remonstrances
his
face
swollen
by
blows
and
stained
with
gouts
of
blood
nevertheless
showed
white
beneath
his
disheveled
hair--as
white
as
that
of
a
corpse
the
man
is
not
insane
said
the
surgeon
preparing
bandages
and
replying
to
a
question
he
is
suffering
from
fright
who
and
what
is
he
private
tassman
began
to
explain
it
was
the
opportunity
of
his
life
he
omitted
nothing
that
could
in
any
way
accentuate
the
importance
of
his
own
relation
to
the
night's
events
when
he
had
finished
his
story
and
was
ready
to
begin
it
again
nobody
gave
him
any
attention
the
general
had
now
recovered
consciousness
he
raised
himself
upon
his
elbow
looked
about
him
and
seeing
the
spy
crouching
by
a
camp-fire
guarded
said
simply
take
that
man
to
the
parade
ground
and
shoot
him
the
general's
mind
wanders
said
an
officer
standing
near
his
mind
does
not
wander
the
adjutant-general
said
i
have
a
memorandum
from
him
about
this
business
he
had
given
that
same
order
to
hasterlick--with
a
motion
of
the
hand
toward
the
dead
provost-marshal--
and
by
god
it
shall
be
executed
ten
minutes
later
sergeant
parker
adderson
of
the
federal
army
philosopher
and
wit
kneeling
in
the
moonlight
and
begging
incoherently
for
his
life
was
shot
to
death
by
twenty
men
as
the
volley
rang
out
upon
the
keen
air
of
the
midnight
general
clavering
lying
white
and
still
in
the
red
glow
of
the
camp-fire
opened
his
big
blue
eyes
looked
pleasantly
upon
those
about
him
and
said
how
silent
it
all
is
the
surgeon
looked
at
the
adjutant-general
gravely
and
significantly
the
patient's
eyes
slowly
closed
and
thus
he
lay
for
a
few
moments
then
his
face
suffused
with
a
smile
of
ineffable
sweetness
he
said
faintly
i
suppose
this
must
be
death
and
so
passed
away
an
affair
of
outposts
i
concerning
the
wish
to
be
dead
two
men
sat
in
conversation
one
was
the
governor
of
the
state
the
year
was
1861
the
war
was
on
and
the
governor
already
famous
for
the
intelligence
and
zeal
with
which
he
directed
all
the
powers
and
resources
of
his
state
to
the
service
of
the
union
what
you
the
governor
was
saying
in
evident
surprise--you
too
want
a
military
commission
really
the
fifing
and
drumming
must
have
effected
a
profound
alteration
in
your
convictions
in
my
character
of
recruiting
sergeant
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
be
fastidious
but--there
was
a
touch
of
irony
in
his
manner--well
have
you
forgotten
that
an
oath
of
allegiance
is
required
i
have
altered
neither
my
convictions
nor
my
sympathies
said
the
other
tranquilly
while
my
sympathies
are
with
the
south
as
you
do
me
the
honor
to
recollect
i
have
never
doubted
that
the
north
was
in
the
right
i
am
a
southerner
in
fact
and
in
feeling
but
it
is
my
habit
in
matters
of
importance
to
act
as
i
think
not
as
i
feel
the
governor
was
absently
tapping
his
desk
with
a
pencil
he
did
not
immediately
reply
after
a
while
he
said
i
have
heard
that
there
are
all
kinds
of
men
in
the
world
so
i
suppose
there
are
some
like
that
and
doubtless
you
think
yourself
one
i've
known
you
a
long
time
and--
pardon
me--i
don't
think
so
then
i
am
to
understand
that
my
application
is
denied
unless
you
can
remove
my
belief
that
your
southern
sympathies
are
in
some
degree
a
disqualification
yes
i
do
not
doubt
your
good
faith
and
i
know
you
to
be
abundantly
fitted
by
intelligence
and
special
training
for
the
duties
of
an
officer
your
convictions
you
say
favor
the
union
cause
but
i
prefer
a
man
with
his
heart
in
it
the
heart
is
what
men
fight
with
look
here
governor
said
the
younger
man
with
a
smile
that
had
more
light
than
warmth
i
have
something
up
my
sleeve--a
qualification
which
i
had
hoped
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
mention
a
great
military
authority
has
given
a
simple
recipe
for
being
a
good
soldier
'try
always
to
get
yourself
killed'
it
is
with
that
purpose
that
i
wish
to
enter
the
service
i
am
not
perhaps
much
of
a
patriot
but
i
wish
to
be
dead
the
governor
looked
at
him
rather
sharply
then
a
little
coldly
there
is
a
simpler
and
franker
way
he
said
in
my
family
sir
was
the
reply
we
do
not
do
that--no
armisted
has
ever
done
that
a
long
silence
ensued
and
neither
man
looked
at
the
other
presently
the
governor
lifted
his
eyes
from
the
pencil
which
had
resumed
its
tapping
and
said
who
is
she
my
wife
the
governor
tossed
the
pencil
into
the
desk
rose
and
walked
two
or
three
times
across
the
room
then
he
turned
to
armisted
who
also
had
risen
looked
at
him
more
coldly
than
before
and
said
but
the
man--
would
it
not
be
better
that
he--could
not
the
country
spare
him
better
than
it
can
spare
you
or
are
the
armisteds
opposed
to
'the
unwritten
law'
the
armisteds
apparently
could
feel
an
insult
the
face
of
the
younger
man
flushed
then
paled
but
he
subdued
himself
to
the
service
of
his
purpose
the
man's
identity
is
unknown
to
me
he
said
calmly
enough
pardon
me
said
the
governor
with
even
less
of
visible
contrition
than
commonly
underlies
those
words
after
a
moment's
reflection
he
added
i
shall
send
you
to-morrow
a
captain's
commission
in
the
tenth
infantry
now
at
nashville
tennessee
good
night
good
night
sir
i
thank
you
left
alone
the
governor
remained
for
a
time
motionless
leaning
against
his
desk
presently
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
if
throwing
off
a
burden
this
is
a
bad
business
he
said
seating
himself
at
a
reading-table
before
the
fire
he
took
up
the
book
nearest
his
hand
absently
opening
it
his
eyes
fell
upon
this
sentence
when
god
made
it
necessary
for
an
unfaithful
wife
to
lie
about
her
husband
in
justification
of
her
own
sins
he
had
the
tenderness
to
endow
men
with
the
folly
to
believe
her
he
looked
at
the
title
of
the
book
it
was
his
excellency
the
fool
he
flung
the
volume
into
the
fire
ii
how
to
say
what
is
worth
hearing
the
enemy
defeated
in
two
days
of
battle
at
pittsburg
landing
had
sullenly
retired
to
corinth
whence
he
had
come
for
manifest
incompetence
grant
whose
beaten
army
had
been
saved
from
destruction
and
capture
by
buell's
soldierly
activity
and
skill
had
been
relieved
of
his
command
which
nevertheless
had
not
been
given
to
buell
but
to
halleck
a
man
of
unproved
powers
a
theorist
sluggish
irresolute
foot
by
foot
his
troops
always
deployed
in
line-of-battle
to
resist
the
enemy's
bickering
skirmishers
always
entrenching
against
the
columns
that
never
came
advanced
across
the
thirty
miles
of
forest
and
swamp
toward
an
antagonist
prepared
to
vanish
at
contact
like
a
ghost
at
cock-crow
it
was
a
campaign
of
excursions
and
alarums
of
reconnoissances
and
counter-marches
of
cross-purposes
and
countermanded
orders
for
weeks
the
solemn
farce
held
attention
luring
distinguished
civilians
from
fields
of
political
ambition
to
see
what
they
safely
could
of
the
horrors
of
war
among
these
was
our
friend
the
governor
at
the
headquarters
of
the
army
and
in
the
camps
of
the
troops
from
his
state
he
was
a
familiar
figure
attended
by
the
several
members
of
his
personal
staff
showily
horsed
faultlessly
betailored
and
bravely
silk-hatted
things
of
charm
they
were
rich
in
suggestions
of
peaceful
lands
beyond
a
sea
of
strife
the
bedraggled
soldier
looked
up
from
his
trench
as
they
passed
leaned
upon
his
spade
and
audibly
damned
them
to
signify
his
sense
of
their
ornamental
irrelevance
to
the
austerities
of
his
trade
i
think
governor
said
general
masterson
one
day
going
into
informal
session
atop
of
his
horse
and
throwing
one
leg
across
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
his
favorite
posture--i
think
i
would
not
ride
any
farther
in
that
direction
if
i
were
you
we've
nothing
out
there
but
a
line
of
skirmishers
that
i
presume
is
why
i
was
directed
to
put
these
siege
guns
here
if
the
skirmishers
are
driven
in
the
enemy
will
die
of
dejection
at
being
unable
to
haul
them
away--they're
a
trifle
heavy
there
is
reason
to
fear
that
the
unstrained
quality
of
this
military
humor
dropped
not
as
the
gentle
rain
from
heaven
upon
the
place
beneath
the
civilian's
silk
hat
anyhow
he
abated
none
of
his
dignity
in
recognition
i
understand
he
said
gravely
that
some
of
my
men
are
out
there--a
company
of
the
tenth
commanded
by
captain
armisted
i
should
like
to
meet
him
if
you
do
not
mind
he
is
worth
meeting
but
there's
a
bad
bit
of
jungle
out
there
and
i
should
advise
that
you
leave
your
horse
and--with
a
look
at
the
governor's
retinue--your
other
impedimenta
the
governor
went
forward
alone
and
on
foot
in
a
half-hour
he
had
pushed
through
a
tangled
undergrowth
covering
a
boggy
soil
and
entered
upon
firm
and
more
open
ground
here
he
found
a
half-company
of
infantry
lounging
behind
a
line
of
stacked
rifles
the
men
wore
their
accoutrements--their
belts
cartridge-boxes
haversacks
and
canteens
some
lying
at
full
length
on
the
dry
leaves
were
fast
asleep
others
in
small
groups
gossiped
idly
of
this
and
that
a
few
played
at
cards
none
was
far
from
the
line
of
stacked
arms
to
the
civilian's
eye
the
scene
was
one
of
carelessness
confusion
indifference
a
soldier
would
have
observed
expectancy
and
readiness
at
a
little
distance
apart
an
officer
in
fatigue
uniform
armed
sat
on
a
fallen
tree
noting
the
approach
of
the
visitor
to
whom
a
sergeant
rising
from
one
of
the
groups
now
came
forward
i
wish
to
see
captain
armisted
said
the
governor
the
sergeant
eyed
him
narrowly
saying
nothing
pointed
to
the
officer
and
taking
a
rifle
from
one
of
the
stacks
accompanied
him
this
man
wants
to
see
you
sir
said
the
sergeant
saluting
the
officer
rose
it
would
have
been
a
sharp
eye
that
would
have
recognized
him
his
hair
which
but
a
few
months
before
had
been
brown
was
streaked
with
gray
his
face
tanned
by
exposure
was
seamed
as
with
age
a
long
livid
scar
across
the
forehead
marked
the
stroke
of
a
sabre
one
cheek
was
drawn
and
puckered
by
the
work
of
a
bullet
only
a
woman
of
the
loyal
north
would
have
thought
the
man
handsome
armisted--captain
said
the
governor
extending
his
hand
do
you
not
know
me
i
know
you
sir
and
i
salute
you--as
the
governor
of
my
state
lifting
his
right
hand
to
the
level
of
his
eyes
he
threw
it
outward
and
downward
in
the
code
of
military
etiquette
there
is
no
provision
for
shaking
hands
that
of
the
civilian
was
withdrawn
if
he
felt
either
surprise
or
chagrin
his
face
did
not
betray
it
it
is
the
hand
that
signed
your
commission
he
said
and
it
is
the
hand--
the
sentence
remains
unfinished
the
sharp
report
of
a
rifle
came
from
the
front
followed
by
another
and
another
a
bullet
hissed
through
the
forest
and
struck
a
tree
near
by
the
men
sprang
from
the
ground
and
even
before
the
captain's
high
clear
voice
was
done
intoning
the
command
at-ten-tion
had
fallen
into
line
in
rear
of
the
stacked
arms
again--and
now
through
the
din
of
a
crackling
fusillade--sounded
the
strong
deliberate
sing-song
of
authority
take
arms
followed
by
the
rattle
of
unlocking
bayonets
bullets
from
the
unseen
enemy
were
now
flying
thick
and
fast
though
mostly
well
spent
and
emitting
the
humming
sound
which
signified
interference
by
twigs
and
rotation
in
the
plane
of
flight
two
or
three
of
the
men
in
the
line
were
already
struck
and
down
a
few
wounded
men
came
limping
awkwardly
out
of
the
undergrowth
from
the
skirmish
line
in
front
most
of
them
did
not
pause
but
held
their
way
with
white
faces
and
set
teeth
to
the
rear
suddenly
there
was
a
deep
jarring
report
in
front
followed
by
the
startling
rush
of
a
shell
which
passing
overhead
exploded
in
the
edge
of
a
thicket
setting
afire
the
fallen
leaves
penetrating
the
din--
seeming
to
float
above
it
like
the
melody
of
a
soaring
bird--rang
the
slow
aspirated
monotones
of
the
captain's
several
commands
without
emphasis
without
accent
musical
and
restful
as
an
evensong
under
the
harvest
moon
familiar
with
this
tranquilizing
chant
in
moments
of
imminent
peril
these
raw
soldiers
of
less
than
a
year's
training
yielded
themselves
to
the
spell
executing
its
mandates
with
the
composure
and
precision
of
veterans
even
the
distinguished
civilian
behind
his
tree
hesitating
between
pride
and
terror
was
accessible
to
its
charm
and
suasion
he
was
conscious
of
a
fortified
resolution
and
ran
away
only
when
the
skirmishers
under
orders
to
rally
on
the
reserve
came
out
of
the
woods
like
hunted
hares
and
formed
on
the
left
of
the
stiff
little
line
breathing
hard
and
thankful
for
the
boon
of
breath
iii
the
fighting
of
one
whose
heart
was
not
in
the
quarrel
guided
in
his
retreat
by
that
of
the
fugitive
wounded
the
governor
struggled
bravely
to
the
rear
through
the
bad
bit
of
jungle
he
was
well
winded
and
a
trifle
confused
excepting
a
single
rifle-shot
now
and
again
there
was
no
sound
of
strife
behind
him
the
enemy
was
pulling
himself
together
for
a
new
onset
against
an
antagonist
of
whose
numbers
and
tactical
disposition
he
was
in
doubt
the
fugitive
felt
that
he
would
probably
be
spared
to
his
country
and
only
commended
the
arrangements
of
providence
to
that
end
but
in
leaping
a
small
brook
in
more
open
ground
one
of
the
arrangements
incurred
the
mischance
of
a
disabling
sprain
at
the
ankle
he
was
unable
to
continue
his
flight
for
he
was
too
fat
to
hop
and
after
several
vain
attempts
causing
intolerable
pain
seated
himself
on
the
earth
to
nurse
his
ignoble
disability
and
deprecate
the
military
situation
a
brisk
renewal
of
the
firing
broke
out
and
stray
bullets
came
flitting
and
droning
by
then
came
the
crash
of
two
clean
definite
volleys
followed
by
a
continuous
rattle
through
which
he
heard
the
yells
and
cheers
of
the
combatants
punctuated
by
thunderclaps
of
cannon
all
this
told
him
that
armisted's
little
command
was
bitterly
beset
and
fighting
at
close
quarters
the
wounded
men
whom
he
had
distanced
began
to
straggle
by
on
either
hand
their
numbers
visibly
augmented
by
new
levies
from
the
line
singly
and
by
twos
and
threes
some
supporting
comrades
more
desperately
hurt
than
themselves
but
all
deaf
to
his
appeals
for
assistance
they
sifted
through
the
underbrush
and
disappeared
the
firing
was
increasingly
louder
and
more
distinct
and
presently
the
ailing
fugitives
were
succeeded
by
men
who
strode
with
a
firmer
tread
occasionally
facing
about
and
discharging
their
pieces
then
doggedly
resuming
their
retreat
reloading
as
they
walked
two
or
three
fell
as
he
looked
and
lay
motionless
one
had
enough
of
life
left
in
him
to
make
a
pitiful
attempt
to
drag
himself
to
cover
a
passing
comrade
paused
beside
him
long
enough
to
fire
appraised
the
poor
devil's
disability
with
a
look
and
moved
sullenly
on
inserting
a
cartridge
in
his
weapon
in
all
this
was
none
of
the
pomp
of
war--no
hint
of
glory
even
in
his
distress
and
peril
the
helpless
civilian
could
not
forbear
to
contrast
it
with
the
gorgeous
parades
and
reviews
held
in
honor
of
himself--with
the
brilliant
uniforms
the
music
the
banners
and
the
marching
it
was
an
ugly
and
sickening
business
to
all
that
was
artistic
in
his
nature
revolting
brutal
in
bad
taste
ugh
he
grunted
shuddering--this
is
beastly
where
is
the
charm
of
it
all
where
are
the
elevated
sentiments
the
devotion
the
heroism
the--
from
a
point
somewhere
near
in
the
direction
of
the
pursuing
enemy
rose
the
clear
deliberate
sing-song
of
captain
armisted
stead-y
men--stead-y
halt
com-mence
fir-ing
the
rattle
of
fewer
than
a
score
of
rifles
could
be
distinguished
through
the
general
uproar
and
again
that
penetrating
falsetto
cease
fir-ing
in
re-treat
maaarch
in
a
few
moments
this
remnant
had
drifted
slowly
past
the
governor
all
to
the
right
of
him
as
they
faced
in
retiring
the
men
deployed
at
intervals
of
a
half-dozen
paces
at
the
extreme
left
and
a
few
yards
behind
came
the
captain
the
civilian
called
out
his
name
but
he
did
not
hear
a
swarm
of
men
in
gray
now
broke
out
of
cover
in
pursuit
making
directly
for
the
spot
where
the
governor
lay--some
accident
of
the
ground
had
caused
them
to
converge
upon
that
point
their
line
had
become
a
crowd
in
a
last
struggle
for
life
and
liberty
the
governor
attempted
to
rise
and
looking
back
the
captain
saw
him
promptly
but
with
the
same
slow
precision
as
before
he
sang
his
commands
skirm-ish-ers
halt
the
men
stopped
and
according
to
rule
turned
to
face
the
enemy
ral-ly
on
the
right--and
they
came
in
at
a
run
fixing
bayonets
and
forming
loosely
on
the
man
at
that
end
of
the
line
forward
to
save
the
gov-ern-or
of
your
state
doub-le
quick
maaarch
only
one
man
disobeyed
this
astonishing
command
he
was
dead
with
a
cheer
they
sprang
forward
over
the
twenty
or
thirty
paces
between
them
and
their
task
the
captain
having
a
shorter
distance
to
go
arrived
first--simultaneously
with
the
enemy
a
half-dozen
hasty
shots
were
fired
at
him
and
the
foremost
man--a
fellow
of
heroic
stature
hatless
and
bare-breasted--made
a
vicious
sweep
at
his
head
with
a
clubbed
rifle
the
officer
parried
the
blow
at
the
cost
of
a
broken
arm
and
drove
his
sword
to
the
hilt
into
the
giant's
breast
as
the
body
fell
the
weapon
was
wrenched
from
his
hand
and
before
he
could
pluck
his
revolver
from
the
scabbard
at
his
belt
another
man
leaped
upon
him
like
a
tiger
fastening
both
hands
upon
his
throat
and
bearing
him
backward
upon
the
prostrate
governor
still
struggling
to
rise
this
man
was
promptly
spitted
upon
the
bayonet
of
a
federal
sergeant
and
his
death-gripe
on
the
captain's
throat
loosened
by
a
kick
upon
each
wrist
when
the
captain
had
risen
he
was
at
the
rear
of
his
men
who
had
all
passed
over
and
around
him
and
were
thrusting
fiercely
at
their
more
numerous
but
less
coherent
antagonists
nearly
all
the
rifles
on
both
sides
were
empty
and
in
the
crush
there
was
neither
time
nor
room
to
reload
the
confederates
were
at
a
disadvantage
in
that
most
of
them
lacked
bayonets
they
fought
by
bludgeoning--and
a
clubbed
rifle
is
a
formidable
arm
the
sound
of
the
conflict
was
a
clatter
like
that
of
the
interlocking
horns
of
battling
bulls--now
and
then
the
pash
of
a
crushed
skull
an
oath
or
a
grunt
caused
by
the
impact
of
a
rifle's
muzzle
against
the
abdomen
transfixed
by
its
bayonet
through
an
opening
made
by
the
fall
of
one
of
his
men
captain
armisted
sprang
with
his
dangling
left
arm
in
his
right
hand
a
full-charged
revolver
which
he
fired
with
rapidity
and
terrible
effect
into
the
thick
of
the
gray
crowd
but
across
the
bodies
of
the
slain
the
survivors
in
the
front
were
pushed
forward
by
their
comrades
in
the
rear
till
again
they
breasted
the
tireless
bayonets
there
were
fewer
bayonets
now
to
breast--a
beggarly
half-dozen
all
told
a
few
minutes
more
of
this
rough
work--a
little
fighting
back
to
back--and
all
would
be
over
suddenly
a
lively
firing
was
heard
on
the
right
and
the
left
a
fresh
line
of
federal
skirmishers
came
forward
at
a
run
driving
before
them
those
parts
of
the
confederate
line
that
had
been
separated
by
staying
the
advance
of
the
centre
and
behind
these
new
and
noisy
combatants
at
a
distance
of
two
or
three
hundred
yards
could
be
seen
indistinct
among
the
trees
a
line-of-battle
instinctively
before
retiring
the
crowd
in
gray
made
a
tremendous
rush
upon
its
handful
of
antagonists
overwhelming
them
by
mere
momentum
and
unable
to
use
weapons
in
the
crush
trampled
them
stamped
savagely
on
their
limbs
their
bodies
their
necks
their
faces
then
retiring
with
bloody
feet
across
its
own
dead
it
joined
the
general
rout
and
the
incident
was
at
an
end
iv
the
great
honor
the
great
the
governor
who
had
been
unconscious
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
about
him
slowly
recalling
the
day's
events
a
man
in
the
uniform
of
a
major
was
kneeling
beside
him
he
was
a
surgeon
grouped
about
were
the
civilian
members
of
the
governor's
staff
their
faces
expressing
a
natural
solicitude
regarding
their
offices
a
little
apart
stood
general
masterson
addressing
another
officer
and
gesticulating
with
a
cigar
he
was
saying
it
was
the
beautifulest
fight
ever
made--by
god
sir
it
was
great
the
beauty
and
greatness
were
attested
by
a
row
of
dead
trimly
disposed
and
another
of
wounded
less
formally
placed
restless
half-naked
but
bravely
bebandaged
how
do
you
feel
sir
said
the
surgeon
i
find
no
wound
i
think
i
am
all
right
the
patient
replied
sitting
up
it
is
that
ankle
the
surgeon
transferred
his
attention
to
the
ankle
cutting
away
the
boot
all
eyes
followed
the
knife
in
moving
the
leg
a
folded
paper
was
uncovered
the
patient
picked
it
up
and
carelessly
opened
it
it
was
a
letter
three
months
old
signed
julia
catching
sight
of
his
name
in
it
he
read
it
it
was
nothing
very
remarkable--merely
a
weak
woman's
confession
of
unprofitable
sin--
the
penitence
of
a
faithless
wife
deserted
by
her
betrayer
the
letter
had
fallen
from
the
pocket
of
captain
armisted
the
reader
quietly
transferred
it
to
his
own
an
aide-de-camp
rode
up
and
dismounted
advancing
to
the
governor
he
saluted
sir
he
said
i
am
sorry
to
find
you
wounded--the
commanding
general
has
not
been
informed
he
presents
his
compliments
and
i
am
directed
to
say
that
he
has
ordered
for
to-morrow
a
grand
review
of
the
reserve
corps
in
your
honor
i
venture
to
add
that
the
general's
carriage
is
at
your
service
if
you
are
able
to
attend
be
pleased
to
say
to
the
commanding
general
that
i
am
deeply
touched
by
his
kindness
if
you
have
the
patience
to
wait
a
few
moments
you
shall
convey
a
more
definite
reply
he
smiled
brightly
and
glancing
at
the
surgeon
and
his
assistants
added
at
present--if
you
will
permit
an
allusion
to
the
horrors
of
peace--i
am
'in
the
hands
of
my
friends'
the
humor
of
the
great
is
infectious
all
laughed
who
heard
where
is
captain
armisted
the
governor
asked
not
altogether
carelessly
the
surgeon
looked
up
from
his
work
pointing
silently
to
the
nearest
body
in
the
row
of
dead
the
features
discreetly
covered
with
a
handkerchief
it
was
so
near
that
the
great
man
could
have
laid
his
hand
upon
it
but
he
did
not
he
may
have
feared
that
it
would
bleed
the
story
of
a
conscience
i
captain
parrol
hartroy
stood
at
the
advanced
post
of
his
picket-guard
talking
in
low
tones
with
the
sentinel
this
post
was
on
a
turnpike
which
bisected
the
captain's
camp
a
half-mile
in
rear
though
the
camp
was
not
in
sight
from
that
point
the
officer
was
apparently
giving
the
soldier
certain
instructions--was
perhaps
merely
inquiring
if
all
were
quiet
in
front
as
the
two
stood
talking
a
man
approached
them
from
the
direction
of
the
camp
carelessly
whistling
and
was
promptly
halted
by
the
soldier
he
was
evidently
a
civilian--a
tall
person
coarsely
clad
in
the
home-made
stuff
of
yellow
gray
called
butternut
which
was
men's
only
wear
in
the
latter
days
of
the
confederacy
on
his
head
was
a
slouch
felt
hat
once
white
from
beneath
which
hung
masses
of
uneven
hair
seemingly
unacquainted
with
either
scissors
or
comb
the
man's
face
was
rather
striking
a
broad
forehead
high
nose
and
thin
cheeks
the
mouth
invisible
in
the
full
dark
beard
which
seemed
as
neglected
as
the
hair
the
eyes
were
large
and
had
that
steadiness
and
fixity
of
attention
which
so
frequently
mark
a
considering
intelligence
and
a
will
not
easily
turned
from
its
purpose--so
say
those
physiognomists
who
have
that
kind
of
eyes
on
the
whole
this
was
a
man
whom
one
would
be
likely
to
observe
and
be
observed
by
he
carried
a
walking-stick
freshly
cut
from
the
forest
and
his
ailing
cowskin
boots
were
white
with
dust
show
your
pass
said
the
federal
soldier
a
trifle
more
imperiously
perhaps
than
he
would
have
thought
necessary
if
he
had
not
been
under
the
eye
of
his
commander
who
with
folded
arms
looked
on
from
the
roadside
'lowed
you'd
rec'lect
me
gineral
said
the
wayfarer
tranquilly
while
producing
the
paper
from
the
pocket
of
his
coat
there
was
something
in
his
tone--perhaps
a
faint
suggestion
of
irony--which
made
his
elevation
of
his
obstructor
to
exalted
rank
less
agreeable
to
that
worthy
warrior
than
promotion
is
commonly
found
to
be
you-all
have
to
be
purty
pertickler
i
reckon
he
added
in
a
more
conciliatory
tone
as
if
in
half-apology
for
being
halted
having
read
the
pass
with
his
rifle
resting
on
the
ground
the
soldier
handed
the
document
back
without
a
word
shouldered
his
weapon
and
returned
to
his
commander
the
civilian
passed
on
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
when
he
had
penetrated
the
circumjacent
confederacy
a
few
yards
resumed
his
whistling
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
beyond
an
angle
in
the
road
which
at
that
point
entered
a
thin
forest
suddenly
the
officer
undid
his
arms
from
his
breast
drew
a
revolver
from
his
belt
and
sprang
forward
at
a
run
in
the
same
direction
leaving
his
sentinel
in
gaping
astonishment
at
his
post
after
making
to
the
various
visible
forms
of
nature
a
solemn
promise
to
be
damned
that
gentleman
resumed
the
air
of
stolidity
which
is
supposed
to
be
appropriate
to
a
state
of
alert
military
attention
ii
captain
hartroy
held
an
independent
command
his
force
consisted
of
a
company
of
infantry
a
squadron
of
cavalry
and
a
section
of
artillery
detached
from
the
army
to
which
they
belonged
to
defend
an
important
defile
in
the
cumberland
mountains
in
tennessee
it
was
a
field
officer's
command
held
by
a
line
officer
promoted
from
the
ranks
where
he
had
quietly
served
until
discovered
his
post
was
one
of
exceptional
peril
its
defense
entailed
a
heavy
responsibility
and
he
had
wisely
been
given
corresponding
discretionary
powers
all
the
more
necessary
because
of
his
distance
from
the
main
army
the
precarious
nature
of
his
communications
and
the
lawless
character
of
the
enemy's
irregular
troops
infesting
that
region
he
had
strongly
fortified
his
little
camp
which
embraced
a
village
of
a
half-dozen
dwellings
and
a
country
store
and
had
collected
a
considerable
quantity
of
supplies
to
a
few
resident
civilians
of
known
loyalty
with
whom
it
was
desirable
to
trade
and
of
whose
services
in
various
ways
he
sometimes
availed
himself
he
had
given
written
passes
admitting
them
within
his
lines
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
an
abuse
of
this
privilege
in
the
interest
of
the
enemy
might
entail
serious
consequences
captain
hartroy
had
made
an
order
to
the
effect
that
any
one
so
abusing
it
would
be
summarily
shot
while
the
sentinel
had
been
examining
the
civilian's
pass
the
captain
had
eyed
the
latter
narrowly
he
thought
his
appearance
familiar
and
had
at
first
no
doubt
of
having
given
him
the
pass
which
had
satisfied
the
sentinel
it
was
not
until
the
man
had
got
out
of
sight
and
hearing
that
his
identity
was
disclosed
by
a
revealing
light
from
memory
with
soldierly
promptness
of
decision
the
officer
had
acted
on
the
revelation
iii
to
any
but
a
singularly
self-possessed
man
the
apparition
of
an
officer
of
the
military
forces
formidably
clad
bearing
in
one
hand
a
sheathed
sword
and
in
the
other
a
cocked
revolver
and
rushing
in
furious
pursuit
is
no
doubt
disquieting
to
a
high
degree
upon
the
man
to
whom
the
pursuit
was
in
this
instance
directed
it
appeared
to
have
no
other
effect
than
somewhat
to
intensify
his
tranquillity
he
might
easily
enough
have
escaped
into
the
forest
to
the
right
or
the
left
but
chose
another
course
of
action--turned
and
quietly
faced
the
captain
saying
as
he
came
up
i
reckon
ye
must
have
something
to
say
to
me
which
ye
disremembered
what
mout
it
be
neighbor
but
the
neighbor
did
not
answer
being
engaged
in
the
unneighborly
act
of
covering
him
with
a
cocked
pistol
surrender
said
the
captain
as
calmly
as
a
slight
breathlessness
from
exertion
would
permit
or
you
die
there
was
no
menace
in
the
manner
of
this
demand
that
was
all
in
the
matter
and
in
the
means
of
enforcing
it
there
was
too
something
not
altogether
reassuring
in
the
cold
gray
eyes
that
glanced
along
the
barrel
of
the
weapon
for
a
moment
the
two
men
stood
looking
at
each
other
in
silence
then
the
civilian
with
no
appearance
of
fear--with
as
great
apparent
unconcern
as
when
complying
with
the
less
austere
demand
of
the
sentinel--slowly
pulled
from
his
pocket
the
paper
which
had
satisfied
that
humble
functionary
and
held
it
out
saying
i
reckon
this
'ere
parss
from
mister
hartroy
is--
the
pass
is
a
forgery
the
officer
said
interrupting
i
am
captain
hartroy--and
you
are
dramer
brune
it
would
have
required
a
sharp
eye
to
observe
the
slight
pallor
of
the
civilian's
face
at
these
words
and
the
only
other
manifestation
attesting
their
significance
was
a
voluntary
relaxation
of
the
thumb
and
fingers
holding
the
dishonored
paper
which
falling
to
the
road
unheeded
was
rolled
by
a
gentle
wind
and
then
lay
still
with
a
coating
of
dust
as
in
humiliation
for
the
lie
that
it
bore
a
moment
later
the
civilian
still
looking
unmoved
into
the
barrel
of
the
pistol
said
yes
i
am
dramer
brune
a
confederate
spy
and
your
prisoner
i
have
on
my
person
as
you
will
soon
discover
a
plan
of
your
fort
and
its
armament
a
statement
of
the
distribution
of
your
men
and
their
number
a
map
of
the
approaches
showing
the
positions
of
all
your
outposts
my
life
is
fairly
yours
but
if
you
wish
it
taken
in
a
more
formal
way
than
by
your
own
hand
and
if
you
are
willing
to
spare
me
the
indignity
of
marching
into
camp
at
the
muzzle
of
your
pistol
i
promise
you
that
i
will
neither
resist
escape
nor
remonstrate
but
will
submit
to
whatever
penalty
may
be
imposed
the
officer
lowered
his
pistol
uncocked
it
and
thrust
it
into
its
place
in
his
belt
brune
advanced
a
step
extending
his
right
hand
it
is
the
hand
of
a
traitor
and
a
spy
said
the
officer
coldly
and
did
not
take
it
the
other
bowed
come
said
the
captain
let
us
go
to
camp
you
shall
not
die
until
to-morrow
morning
he
turned
his
back
upon
his
prisoner
and
these
two
enigmatical
men
retraced
their
steps
and
soon
passed
the
sentinel
who
expressed
his
general
sense
of
things
by
a
needless
and
exaggerated
salute
to
his
commander
iv
early
on
the
morning
after
these
events
the
two
men
captor
and
captive
sat
in
the
tent
of
the
former
a
table
was
between
them
on
which
lay
among
a
number
of
letters
official
and
private
which
the
captain
had
written
during
the
night
the
incriminating
papers
found
upon
the
spy
that
gentleman
had
slept
through
the
night
in
an
adjoining
tent
unguarded
both
having
breakfasted
were
now
smoking
mr
brune
said
captain
hartroy
you
probably
do
not
understand
why
i
recognized
you
in
your
disguise
nor
how
i
was
aware
of
your
name
i
have
not
sought
to
learn
captain
the
prisoner
said
with
quiet
dignity
nevertheless
i
should
like
you
to
know--if
the
story
will
not
offend
you
will
perceive
that
my
knowledge
of
you
goes
back
to
the
autumn
of
1861
at
that
time
you
were
a
private
in
an
ohio
regiment--a
brave
and
trusted
soldier
to
the
surprise
and
grief
of
your
officers
and
comrades
you
deserted
and
went
over
to
the
enemy
soon
afterward
you
were
captured
in
a
skirmish
recognized
tried
by
court-martial
and
sentenced
to
be
shot
awaiting
the
execution
of
the
sentence
you
were
confined
unfettered
in
a
freight
car
standing
on
a
side
track
of
a
railway
at
grafton
virginia
said
brune
pushing
the
ashes
from
his
cigar
with
the
little
finger
of
the
hand
holding
it
and
without
looking
up
at
grafton
virginia
the
captain
repeated
one
dark
and
stormy
night
a
soldier
who
had
just
returned
from
a
long
fatiguing
march
was
put
on
guard
over
you
he
sat
on
a
cracker
box
inside
the
car
near
the
door
his
rifle
loaded
and
the
bayonet
fixed
you
sat
in
a
corner
and
his
orders
were
to
kill
you
if
you
attempted
to
rise
but
if
i
asked
to
rise
he
might
call
the
corporal
of
the
guard
yes
as
the
long
silent
hours
wore
away
the
soldier
yielded
to
the
demands
of
nature
he
himself
incurred
the
death
penalty
by
sleeping
at
his
post
of
duty
you
did
what
you
recognize
me
you
have
known
me
all
along
the
captain
had
risen
and
was
walking
the
floor
of
his
tent
visibly
excited
his
face
was
flushed
the
gray
eyes
had
lost
the
cold
pitiless
look
which
they
had
shown
when
brune
had
seen
them
over
the
pistol
barrel
they
had
softened
wonderfully
i
knew
you
said
the
spy
with
his
customary
tranquillity
the
moment
you
faced
me
demanding
my
surrender
in
the
circumstances
it
would
have
been
hardly
becoming
in
me
to
recall
these
matters
i
am
perhaps
a
traitor
certainly
a
spy
but
i
should
not
wish
to
seem
a
suppliant
the
captain
had
paused
in
his
walk
and
was
facing
his
prisoner
there
was
a
singular
huskiness
in
his
voice
as
he
spoke
again
mr
brune
whatever
your
conscience
may
permit
you
to
be
you
saved
my
life
at
what
you
must
have
believed
the
cost
of
your
own
until
i
saw
you
yesterday
when
halted
by
my
sentinel
i
believed
you
dead--thought
that
you
had
suffered
the
fate
which
through
my
own
crime
you
might
easily
have
escaped
you
had
only
to
step
from
the
car
and
leave
me
to
take
your
place
before
the
firing-squad
you
had
a
divine
compassion
you
pitied
my
fatigue
you
let
me
sleep
watched
over
me
and
as
the
time
drew
near
for
the
relief-guard
to
come
and
detect
me
in
my
crime
you
gently
waked
me
ah
brune
brune
that
was
well
done--that
was
great--that--
the
captain's
voice
failed
him
the
tears
were
running
down
his
face
and
sparkled
upon
his
beard
and
his
breast
resuming
his
seat
at
the
table
he
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
and
sobbed
all
else
was
silence
suddenly
the
clear
warble
of
a
bugle
was
heard
sounding
the
assembly
the
captain
started
and
raised
his
wet
face
from
his
arms
it
had
turned
ghastly
pale
outside
in
the
sunlight
were
heard
the
stir
of
the
men
falling
into
line
the
voices
of
the
sergeants
calling
the
roll
the
tapping
of
the
drummers
as
they
braced
their
drums
the
captain
spoke
again
i
ought
to
have
confessed
my
fault
in
order
to
relate
the
story
of
your
magnanimity
it
might
have
procured
you
a
pardon
a
hundred
times
i
resolved
to
do
so
but
shame
prevented
besides
your
sentence
was
just
and
righteous
well
heaven
forgive
me
i
said
nothing
and
my
regiment
was
soon
afterward
ordered
to
tennessee
and
i
never
heard
about
you
it
was
all
right
sir
said
brune
without
visible
emotion
i
escaped
and
returned
to
my
colors--the
confederate
colors
i
should
like
to
add
that
before
deserting
from
the
federal
service
i
had
earnestly
asked
a
discharge
on
the
ground
of
altered
convictions
i
was
answered
by
punishment
ah
but
if
i
had
suffered
the
penalty
of
my
crime--if
you
had
not
generously
given
me
the
life
that
i
accepted
without
gratitude
you
would
not
be
again
in
the
shadow
and
imminence
of
death
the
prisoner
started
slightly
and
a
look
of
anxiety
came
into
his
face
one
would
have
said
too
that
he
was
surprised
at
that
moment
a
lieutenant
the
adjutant
appeared
at
the
opening
of
the
tent
and
saluted
captain
he
said
the
battalion
is
formed
captain
hartroy
had
recovered
his
composure
he
turned
to
the
officer
and
said
lieutenant
go
to
captain
graham
and
say
that
i
direct
him
to
assume
command
of
the
battalion
and
parade
it
outside
the
parapet
this
gentleman
is
a
deserter
and
a
spy
he
is
to
be
shot
to
death
in
the
presence
of
the
troops
he
will
accompany
you
unbound
and
unguarded
while
the
adjutant
waited
at
the
door
the
two
men
inside
the
tent
rose
and
exchanged
ceremonious
bows
brune
immediately
retiring
half
an
hour
later
an
old
negro
cook
the
only
person
left
in
camp
except
the
commander
was
so
startled
by
the
sound
of
a
volley
of
musketry
that
he
dropped
the
kettle
that
he
was
lifting
from
a
fire
but
for
his
consternation
and
the
hissing
which
the
contents
of
the
kettle
made
among
the
embers
he
might
also
have
heard
nearer
at
hand
the
single
pistol
shot
with
which
captain
hartroy
renounced
the
life
which
in
conscience
he
could
no
longer
keep
in
compliance
with
the
terms
of
a
note
that
he
left
for
the
officer
who
succeeded
him
in
command
he
was
buried
like
the
deserter
and
spy
without
military
honors
and
in
the
solemn
shadow
of
the
mountain
which
knows
no
more
of
war
the
two
sleep
well
in
long-forgotten
graves
one
kind
of
officer
i
of
the
uses
of
civility
captain
ransome
it
is
not
permitted
to
you
to
know
anything
it
is
sufficient
that
you
obey
my
order--which
permit
me
to
repeat
if
you
perceive
any
movement
of
troops
in
your
front
you
are
to
open
fire
and
if
attacked
hold
this
position
as
long
as
you
can
do
i
make
myself
understood
sir
nothing
could
be
plainer
lieutenant
price--this
to
an
officer
of
his
own
battery
who
had
ridden
up
in
time
to
hear
the
order--the
general's
meaning
is
clear
is
it
not
perfectly
the
lieutenant
passed
on
to
his
post
for
a
moment
general
cameron
and
the
commander
of
the
battery
sat
in
their
saddles
looking
at
each
other
in
silence
there
was
no
more
to
say
apparently
too
much
had
already
been
said
then
the
superior
officer
nodded
coldly
and
turned
his
horse
to
ride
away
the
artillerist
saluted
slowly
gravely
and
with
extreme
formality
one
acquainted
with
the
niceties
of
military
etiquette
would
have
said
that
by
his
manner
he
attested
a
sense
of
the
rebuke
that
he
had
incurred
it
is
one
of
the
important
uses
of
civility
to
signify
resentment
when
the
general
had
joined
his
staff
and
escort
awaiting
him
at
a
little
distance
the
whole
cavalcade
moved
off
toward
the
right
of
the
guns
and
vanished
in
the
fog
captain
ransome
was
alone
silent
motionless
as
an
equestrian
statue
the
gray
fog
thickening
every
moment
closed
in
about
him
like
a
visible
doom
ii
under
what
circumstances
men
do
not
wish
to
be
shot
the
fighting
of
the
day
before
had
been
desultory
and
indecisive
at
the
points
of
collision
the
smoke
of
battle
had
hung
in
blue
sheets
among
the
branches
of
the
trees
till
beaten
into
nothing
by
the
falling
rain
in
the
softened
earth
the
wheels
of
cannon
and
ammunition
wagons
cut
deep
ragged
furrows
and
movements
of
infantry
seemed
impeded
by
the
mud
that
clung
to
the
soldiers'
feet
as
with
soaken
garments
and
rifles
imperfectly
protected
by
capes
of
overcoats
they
went
dragging
in
sinuous
lines
hither
and
thither
through
dripping
forest
and
flooded
field
mounted
officers
their
heads
protruding
from
rubber
ponchos
that
glittered
like
black
armor
picked
their
way
singly
and
in
loose
groups
among
the
men
coming
and
going
with
apparent
aimlessness
and
commanding
attention
from
nobody
but
one
another
here
and
there
a
dead
man
his
clothing
defiled
with
earth
his
face
covered
with
a
blanket
or
showing
yellow
and
claylike
in
the
rain
added
his
dispiriting
influence
to
that
of
the
other
dismal
features
of
the
scene
and
augmented
the
general
discomfort
with
a
particular
dejection
very
repulsive
these
wrecks
looked--not
at
all
heroic
and
nobody
was
accessible
to
the
infection
of
their
patriotic
example
dead
upon
the
field
of
honor
yes
but
the
field
of
honor
was
so
very
wet
it
makes
a
difference
the
general
engagement
that
all
expected
did
not
occur
none
of
the
small
advantages
accruing
now
to
this
side
and
now
to
that
in
isolated
and
accidental
collisions
being
followed
up
half-hearted
attacks
provoked
a
sullen
resistance
which
was
satisfied
with
mere
repulse
orders
were
obeyed
with
mechanical
fidelity
no
one
did
any
more
than
his
duty
the
army
is
cowardly
to-day
said
general
cameron
the
commander
of
a
federal
brigade
to
his
adjutant-general
the
army
is
cold
replied
the
officer
addressed
and--yes
it
doesn't
wish
to
be
like
that
he
pointed
to
one
of
the
dead
bodies
lying
in
a
thin
pool
of
yellow
water
its
face
and
clothing
bespattered
with
mud
from
hoof
and
wheel
the
army's
weapons
seemed
to
share
its
military
delinquency
the
rattle
of
rifles
sounded
flat
and
contemptible
it
had
no
meaning
and
scarcely
roused
to
attention
and
expectancy
the
unengaged
parts
of
the
line-of-battle
and
the
waiting
reserves
heard
at
a
little
distance
the
reports
of
cannon
were
feeble
in
volume
and
timbre
they
lacked
sting
and
resonance
the
guns
seemed
to
be
fired
with
light
charges
unshotted
and
so
the
futile
day
wore
on
to
its
dreary
close
and
then
to
a
night
of
discomfort
succeeded
a
day
of
apprehension
an
army
has
a
personality
beneath
the
individual
thoughts
and
emotions
of
its
component
parts
it
thinks
and
feels
as
a
unit
and
in
this
large
inclusive
sense
of
things
lies
a
wiser
wisdom
than
the
mere
sum
of
all
that
it
knows
on
that
dismal
morning
this
great
brute
force
groping
at
the
bottom
of
a
white
ocean
of
fog
among
trees
that
seemed
as
sea
weeds
had
a
dumb
consciousness
that
all
was
not
well
that
a
day's
manoeuvring
had
resulted
in
a
faulty
disposition
of
its
parts
a
blind
diffusion
of
its
strength
the
men
felt
insecure
and
talked
among
themselves
of
such
tactical
errors
as
with
their
meager
military
vocabulary
they
were
able
to
name
field
and
line
officers
gathered
in
groups
and
spoke
more
learnedly
of
what
they
apprehended
with
no
greater
clearness
commanders
of
brigades
and
divisions
looked
anxiously
to
their
connections
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
sent
staff
officers
on
errands
of
inquiry
and
pushed
skirmish
lines
silently
and
cautiously
forward
into
the
dubious
region
between
the
known
and
the
unknown
at
some
points
on
the
line
the
troops
apparently
of
their
own
volition
constructed
such
defenses
as
they
could
without
the
silent
spade
and
the
noisy
ax
one
of
these
points
was
held
by
captain
ransome's
battery
of
six
guns
provided
always
with
intrenching
tools
his
men
had
labored
with
diligence
during
the
night
and
now
his
guns
thrust
their
black
muzzles
through
the
embrasures
of
a
really
formidable
earthwork
it
crowned
a
slight
acclivity
devoid
of
undergrowth
and
providing
an
unobstructed
fire
that
would
sweep
the
ground
for
an
unknown
distance
in
front
the
position
could
hardly
have
been
better
chosen
it
had
this
peculiarity
which
captain
ransome
who
was
greatly
addicted
to
the
use
of
the
compass
had
not
failed
to
observe
it
faced
northward
whereas
he
knew
that
the
general
line
of
the
army
must
face
eastward
in
fact
that
part
of
the
line
was
refused--that
is
to
say
bent
backward
away
from
the
enemy
this
implied
that
captain
ransome's
battery
was
somewhere
near
the
left
flank
of
the
army
for
an
army
in
line
of
battle
retires
its
flanks
if
the
nature
of
the
ground
will
permit
they
being
its
vulnerable
points
actually
captain
ransome
appeared
to
hold
the
extreme
left
of
the
line
no
troops
being
visible
in
that
direction
beyond
his
own
immediately
in
rear
of
his
guns
occurred
that
conversation
between
him
and
his
brigade
commander
the
concluding
and
more
picturesque
part
of
which
is
reported
above
iii
how
to
play
the
cannon
without
notes
captain
ransome
sat
motionless
and
silent
on
horseback
a
few
yards
away
his
men
were
standing
at
their
guns
somewhere--everywhere
within
a
few
miles--were
a
hundred
thousand
men
friends
and
enemies
yet
he
was
alone
the
mist
had
isolated
him
as
completely
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
heart
of
a
desert
his
world
was
a
few
square
yards
of
wet
and
trampled
earth
about
the
feet
of
his
horse
his
comrades
in
that
ghostly
domain
were
invisible
and
inaudible
these
were
conditions
favorable
to
thought
and
he
was
thinking
of
the
nature
of
his
thoughts
his
clear-cut
handsome
features
yielded
no
attesting
sign
his
face
was
as
inscrutable
as
that
of
the
sphinx
why
should
it
have
made
a
record
which
there
was
none
to
observe
at
the
sound
of
a
footstep
he
merely
turned
his
eyes
in
the
direction
whence
it
came
one
of
his
sergeants
looking
a
giant
in
stature
in
the
false
perspective
of
the
fog
approached
and
when
clearly
defined
and
reduced
to
his
true
dimensions
by
propinquity
saluted
and
stood
at
attention
well
morris
said
the
officer
returning
his
subordinate's
salute
lieutenant
price
directed
me
to
tell
you
sir
that
most
of
the
infantry
has
been
withdrawn
we
have
not
sufficient
support
yes
i
know
i
am
to
say
that
some
of
our
men
have
been
out
over
the
works
a
hundred
yards
and
report
that
our
front
is
not
picketed
yes
they
were
so
far
forward
that
they
heard
the
enemy
yes
they
heard
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
of
artillery
and
the
commands
of
officers
yes
the
enemy
is
moving
toward
our
works
captain
ransome
who
had
been
facing
to
the
rear
of
his
line--toward
the
point
where
the
brigade
commander
and
his
cavalcade
had
been
swallowed
up
by
the
fog--reined
his
horse
about
and
faced
the
other
way
then
he
sat
motionless
as
before
who
are
the
men
who
made
that
statement
he
inquired
without
looking
at
the
sergeant
his
eyes
were
directed
straight
into
the
fog
over
the
head
of
his
horse
corporal
hassman
and
gunner
manning
captain
ransome
was
a
moment
silent
a
slight
pallor
came
into
his
face
a
slight
compression
affected
the
lines
of
his
lips
but
it
would
have
required
a
closer
observer
than
sergeant
morris
to
note
the
change
there
was
none
in
the
voice
sergeant
present
my
compliments
to
lieutenant
price
and
direct
him
to
open
fire
with
all
the
guns
grape
the
sergeant
saluted
and
vanished
in
the
fog
iv
to
introduce
general
masterson
searching
for
his
division
commander
general
cameron
and
his
escort
had
followed
the
line
of
battle
for
nearly
a
mile
to
the
right
of
ransome's
battery
and
there
learned
that
the
division
commander
had
gone
in
search
of
the
corps
commander
it
seemed
that
everybody
was
looking
for
his
immediate
superior--an
ominous
circumstance
it
meant
that
nobody
was
quite
at
ease
so
general
cameron
rode
on
for
another
half-mile
where
by
good
luck
he
met
general
masterson
the
division
commander
returning
ah
cameron
said
the
higher
officer
reining
up
and
throwing
his
right
leg
across
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
in
a
most
unmilitary
way--
anything
up
found
a
good
position
for
your
battery
i
hope--if
one
place
is
better
than
another
in
a
fog
yes
general
said
the
other
with
the
greater
dignity
appropriate
to
his
less
exalted
rank
my
battery
is
very
well
placed
i
wish
i
could
say
that
it
is
as
well
commanded
eh
what's
that
ransome
i
think
him
a
fine
fellow
in
the
army
we
should
be
proud
of
him
it
was
customary
for
officers
of
the
regular
army
to
speak
of
it
as
the
army
as
the
greatest
cities
are
most
provincial
so
the
self-complacency
of
aristocracies
is
most
frankly
plebeian
he
is
too
fond
of
his
opinion
by
the
way
in
order
to
occupy
the
hill
that
he
holds
i
had
to
extend
my
line
dangerously
the
hill
is
on
my
left--that
is
to
say
the
left
flank
of
the
army
oh
no
hart's
brigade
is
beyond
it
was
ordered
up
from
drytown
during
the
night
and
directed
to
hook
on
to
you
better
go
and--
the
sentence
was
unfinished
a
lively
cannonade
had
broken
out
on
the
left
and
both
officers
followed
by
their
retinues
of
aides
and
orderlies
making
a
great
jingle
and
clank
rode
rapidly
toward
the
spot
but
they
were
soon
impeded
for
they
were
compelled
by
the
fog
to
keep
within
sight
of
the
line-of-battle
behind
which
were
swarms
of
men
all
in
motion
across
their
way
everywhere
the
line
was
assuming
a
sharper
and
harder
definition
as
the
men
sprang
to
arms
and
the
officers
with
drawn
swords
dressed
the
ranks
color-bearers
unfurled
the
flags
buglers
blew
the
assembly
hospital
attendants
appeared
with
stretchers
field
officers
mounted
and
sent
their
impedimenta
to
the
rear
in
care
of
negro
servants
back
in
the
ghostly
spaces
of
the
forest
could
be
heard
the
rustle
and
murmur
of
the
reserves
pulling
themselves
together
nor
was
all
this
preparation
vain
for
scarcely
five
minutes
had
passed
since
captain
ransome's
guns
had
broken
the
truce
of
doubt
before
the
whole
region
was
aroar
the
enemy
had
attacked
nearly
everywhere
v
how
sounds
can
fight
shadows
captain
ransome
walked
up
and
down
behind
his
guns
which
were
firing
rapidly
but
with
steadiness
the
gunners
worked
alertly
but
without
haste
or
apparent
excitement
there
was
really
no
reason
for
excitement
it
is
not
much
to
point
a
cannon
into
a
fog
and
fire
it
anybody
can
do
as
much
as
that
the
men
smiled
at
their
noisy
work
performing
it
with
a
lessening
alacrity
they
cast
curious
regards
upon
their
captain
who
had
now
mounted
the
banquette
of
the
fortification
and
was
looking
across
the
parapet
as
if
observing
the
effect
of
his
fire
but
the
only
visible
effect
was
the
substitution
of
wide
low-lying
sheets
of
smoke
for
their
bulk
of
fog
suddenly
out
of
the
obscurity
burst
a
great
sound
of
cheering
which
filled
the
intervals
between
the
reports
of
the
guns
with
startling
distinctness
to
the
few
with
leisure
and
opportunity
to
observe
the
sound
was
inexpressibly
strange--so
loud
so
near
so
menacing
yet
nothing
seen
the
men
who
had
smiled
at
their
work
smiled
no
more
but
performed
it
with
a
serious
and
feverish
activity
from
his
station
at
the
parapet
captain
ransome
now
saw
a
great
multitude
of
dim
gray
figures
taking
shape
in
the
mist
below
him
and
swarming
up
the
slope
but
the
work
of
the
guns
was
now
fast
and
furious
they
swept
the
populous
declivity
with
gusts
of
grape
and
canister
the
whirring
of
which
could
be
heard
through
the
thunder
of
the
explosions
in
this
awful
tempest
of
iron
the
assailants
struggled
forward
foot
by
foot
across
their
dead
firing
into
the
embrasures
reloading
firing
again
and
at
last
falling
in
their
turn
a
little
in
advance
of
those
who
had
fallen
before
soon
the
smoke
was
dense
enough
to
cover
all
it
settled
down
upon
the
attack
and
drifting
back
involved
the
defense
the
gunners
could
hardly
see
to
serve
their
pieces
and
when
occasional
figures
of
the
enemy
appeared
upon
the
parapet--having
had
the
good
luck
to
get
near
enough
to
it
between
two
embrasures
to
be
protected
from
the
guns--they
looked
so
unsubstantial
that
it
seemed
hardly
worth
while
for
the
few
infantrymen
to
go
to
work
upon
them
with
the
bayonet
and
tumble
them
back
into
the
ditch
as
the
commander
of
a
battery
in
action
can
find
something
better
to
do
than
cracking
individual
skulls
captain
ransome
had
retired
from
the
parapet
to
his
proper
post
in
rear
of
his
guns
where
he
stood
with
folded
arms
his
bugler
beside
him
here
during
the
hottest
of
the
fight
he
was
approached
by
lieutenant
price
who
had
just
sabred
a
daring
assailant
inside
the
work
a
spirited
colloquy
ensued
between
the
two
officers--spirited
at
least
on
the
part
of
the
lieutenant
who
gesticulated
with
energy
and
shouted
again
and
again
into
his
commander's
ear
in
the
attempt
to
make
himself
heard
above
the
infernal
din
of
the
guns
his
gestures
if
coolly
noted
by
an
actor
would
have
been
pronounced
to
be
those
of
protestation
one
would
have
said
that
he
was
opposed
to
the
proceedings
did
he
wish
to
surrender
captain
ransome
listened
without
a
change
of
countenance
or
attitude
and
when
the
other
man
had
finished
his
harangue
looked
him
coldly
in
the
eyes
and
during
a
seasonable
abatement
of
the
uproar
said
lieutenant
price
it
is
not
permitted
to
you
to
know
anything
it
is
sufficient
that
you
obey
my
orders
the
lieutenant
went
to
his
post
and
the
parapet
being
now
apparently
clear
captain
ransome
returned
to
it
to
have
a
look
over
as
he
mounted
the
banquette
a
man
sprang
upon
the
crest
waving
a
great
brilliant
flag
the
captain
drew
a
pistol
from
his
belt
and
shot
him
dead
the
body
pitching
forward
hung
over
the
inner
edge
of
the
embankment
the
arms
straight
downward
both
hands
still
grasping
the
flag
the
man's
few
followers
turned
and
fled
down
the
slope
looking
over
the
parapet
the
captain
saw
no
living
thing
he
observed
also
that
no
bullets
were
coming
into
the
work
he
made
a
sign
to
the
bugler
who
sounded
the
command
to
cease
firing
at
all
other
points
the
action
had
already
ended
with
a
repulse
of
the
confederate
attack
with
the
cessation
of
this
cannonade
the
silence
was
absolute
vi
why
being
affronted
by
a
it
is
not
best
to
affront
b
general
masterson
rode
into
the
redoubt
the
men
gathered
in
groups
were
talking
loudly
and
gesticulating
they
pointed
at
the
dead
running
from
one
body
to
another
they
neglected
their
foul
and
heated
guns
and
forgot
to
resume
their
outer
clothing
they
ran
to
the
parapet
and
looked
over
some
of
them
leaping
down
into
the
ditch
a
score
were
gathered
about
a
flag
rigidly
held
by
a
dead
man
well
my
men
said
the
general
cheerily
you
have
had
a
pretty
fight
of
it
they
stared
nobody
replied
the
presence
of
the
great
man
seemed
to
embarrass
and
alarm
getting
no
response
to
his
pleasant
condescension
the
easy-mannered
officer
whistled
a
bar
or
two
of
a
popular
air
and
riding
forward
to
the
parapet
looked
over
at
the
dead
in
an
instant
he
had
whirled
his
horse
about
and
was
spurring
along
in
rear
of
the
guns
his
eyes
everywhere
at
once
an
officer
sat
on
the
trail
of
one
of
the
guns
smoking
a
cigar
as
the
general
dashed
up
he
rose
and
tranquilly
saluted
captain
ransome--the
words
fell
sharp
and
harsh
like
the
clash
of
steel
blades--you
have
been
fighting
our
own
men--our
own
men
sir
do
you
hear
hart's
brigade
general
i
know
that
you
know
it--you
know
that
and
you
sit
here
smoking
oh
damn
it
hamilton
i'm
losing
my
temper--this
to
his
provost-marshal
sir--
captain
ransome
be
good
enough
to
say--to
say
why
you
fought
our
own
men
that
i
am
unable
to
say
in
my
orders
that
information
was
withheld
apparently
the
general
did
not
comprehend
who
was
the
aggressor
in
this
affair
you
or
general
hart
he
asked
i
was
and
could
you
not
have
known--could
you
not
see
sir
that
you
were
attacking
our
own
men
the
reply
was
astounding
i
knew
that
general
it
appeared
to
be
none
of
my
business
then
breaking
the
dead
silence
that
followed
his
answer
he
said
i
must
refer
you
to
general
cameron
general
cameron
is
dead
sir--as
dead
as
he
can
be--as
dead
as
any
man
in
this
army
he
lies
back
yonder
under
a
tree
do
you
mean
to
say
that
he
had
anything
to
do
with
this
horrible
business
captain
ransome
did
not
reply
observing
the
altercation
his
men
had
gathered
about
to
watch
the
outcome
they
were
greatly
excited
the
fog
which
had
been
partly
dissipated
by
the
firing
had
again
closed
in
so
darkly
about
them
that
they
drew
more
closely
together
till
the
judge
on
horseback
and
the
accused
standing
calmly
before
him
had
but
a
narrow
space
free
from
intrusion
it
was
the
most
informal
of
courts-martial
but
all
felt
that
the
formal
one
to
follow
would
but
affirm
its
judgment
it
had
no
jurisdiction
but
it
had
the
significance
of
prophecy
captain
ransome
the
general
cried
impetuously
but
with
something
in
his
voice
that
was
almost
entreaty
if
you
can
say
anything
to
put
a
better
light
upon
your
incomprehensible
conduct
i
beg
you
will
do
so
having
recovered
his
temper
this
generous
soldier
sought
for
something
to
justify
his
naturally
sympathetic
attitude
toward
a
brave
man
in
the
imminence
of
a
dishonorable
death
where
is
lieutenant
price
the
captain
said
that
officer
stood
forward
his
dark
saturnine
face
looking
somewhat
forbidding
under
a
bloody
handkerchief
bound
about
his
brow
he
understood
the
summons
and
needed
no
invitation
to
speak
he
did
not
look
at
the
captain
but
addressed
the
general
during
the
engagement
i
discovered
the
state
of
affairs
and
apprised
the
commander
of
the
battery
i
ventured
to
urge
that
the
firing
cease
i
was
insulted
and
ordered
to
my
post
do
you
know
anything
of
the
orders
under
which
i
was
acting
asked
the
captain
of
any
orders
under
which
the
commander
of
the
battery
was
acting
the
lieutenant
continued
still
addressing
the
general
i
know
nothing
captain
ransome
felt
his
world
sink
away
from
his
feet
in
those
cruel
words
he
heard
the
murmur
of
the
centuries
breaking
upon
the
shore
of
eternity
he
heard
the
voice
of
doom
it
said
in
cold
mechanical
and
measured
tones
ready
aim
fire
and
he
felt
the
bullets
tear
his
heart
to
shreds
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
earth
upon
his
coffin
and
if
the
good
god
was
so
merciful
the
song
of
a
bird
above
his
forgotten
grave
quietly
detaching
his
sabre
from
its
supports
he
handed
it
up
to
the
provost-marshal
one
officer
one
man
captain
graffenreid
stood
at
the
head
of
his
company
the
regiment
was
not
engaged
it
formed
a
part
of
the
front
line-of-battle
which
stretched
away
to
the
right
with
a
visible
length
of
nearly
two
miles
through
the
open
ground
the
left
flank
was
veiled
by
woods
to
the
right
also
the
line
was
lost
to
sight
but
it
extended
many
miles
a
hundred
yards
in
rear
was
a
second
line
behind
this
the
reserve
brigades
and
divisions
in
column
batteries
of
artillery
occupied
the
spaces
between
and
crowned
the
low
hills
groups
of
horsemen--generals
with
their
staffs
and
escorts
and
field
officers
of
regiments
behind
the
colors--broke
the
regularity
of
the
lines
and
columns
numbers
of
these
figures
of
interest
had
field-glasses
at
their
eyes
and
sat
motionless
stolidly
scanning
the
country
in
front
others
came
and
went
at
a
slow
canter
bearing
orders
there
were
squads
of
stretcher-bearers
ambulances
wagon-trains
with
ammunition
and
officers'
servants
in
rear
of
all--of
all
that
was
visible--for
still
in
rear
of
these
along
the
roads
extended
for
many
miles
all
that
vast
multitude
of
non-combatants
who
with
their
various
impedimenta
are
assigned
to
the
inglorious
but
important
duty
of
supplying
the
fighters'
many
needs
an
army
in
line-of-battle
awaiting
attack
or
prepared
to
deliver
it
presents
strange
contrasts
at
the
front
are
precision
formality
fixity
and
silence
toward
the
rear
these
characteristics
are
less
and
less
conspicuous
and
finally
in
point
of
space
are
lost
altogether
in
confusion
motion
and
noise
the
homogeneous
becomes
heterogeneous
definition
is
lacking
repose
is
replaced
by
an
apparently
purposeless
activity
harmony
vanishes
in
hubbub
form
in
disorder
commotion
everywhere
and
ceaseless
unrest
the
men
who
do
not
fight
are
never
ready
from
his
position
at
the
right
of
his
company
in
the
front
rank
captain
graffenreid
had
an
unobstructed
outlook
toward
the
enemy
a
half-mile
of
open
and
nearly
level
ground
lay
before
him
and
beyond
it
an
irregular
wood
covering
a
slight
acclivity
not
a
human
being
anywhere
visible
he
could
imagine
nothing
more
peaceful
than
the
appearance
of
that
pleasant
landscape
with
its
long
stretches
of
brown
fields
over
which
the
atmosphere
was
beginning
to
quiver
in
the
heat
of
the
morning
sun
not
a
sound
came
from
forest
or
field--not
even
the
barking
of
a
dog
or
the
crowing
of
a
cock
at
the
half-seen
plantation
house
on
the
crest
among
the
trees
yet
every
man
in
those
miles
of
men
knew
that
he
and
death
were
face
to
face
captain
graffenreid
had
never
in
his
life
seen
an
armed
enemy
and
the
war
in
which
his
regiment
was
one
of
the
first
to
take
the
field
was
two
years
old
he
had
had
the
rare
advantage
of
a
military
education
and
when
his
comrades
had
marched
to
the
front
he
had
been
detached
for
administrative
service
at
the
capital
of
his
state
where
it
was
thought
that
he
could
be
most
useful
like
a
bad
soldier
he
protested
and
like
a
good
one
obeyed
in
close
official
and
personal
relations
with
the
governor
of
his
state
and
enjoying
his
confidence
and
favor
he
had
firmly
refused
promotion
and
seen
his
juniors
elevated
above
him
death
had
been
busy
in
his
distant
regiment
vacancies
among
the
field
officers
had
occurred
again
and
again
but
from
a
chivalrous
feeling
that
war's
rewards
belonged
of
right
to
those
who
bore
the
storm
and
stress
of
battle
he
had
held
his
humble
rank
and
generously
advanced
the
fortunes
of
others
his
silent
devotion
to
principle
had
conquered
at
last
he
had
been
relieved
of
his
hateful
duties
and
ordered
to
the
front
and
now
untried
by
fire
stood
in
the
van
of
battle
in
command
of
a
company
of
hardy
veterans
to
whom
he
had
been
only
a
name
and
that
name
a
by-word
by
none--not
even
by
those
of
his
brother
officers
in
whose
favor
he
had
waived
his
rights--was
his
devotion
to
duty
understood
they
were
too
busy
to
be
just
he
was
looked
upon
as
one
who
had
shirked
his
duty
until
forced
unwillingly
into
the
field
too
proud
to
explain
yet
not
too
insensible
to
feel
he
could
only
endure
and
hope
of
all
the
federal
army
on
that
summer
morning
none
had
accepted
battle
more
joyously
than
anderton
graffenreid
his
spirit
was
buoyant
his
faculties
were
riotous
he
was
in
a
state
of
mental
exaltation
and
scarcely
could
endure
the
enemy's
tardiness
in
advancing
to
the
attack
to
him
this
was
opportunity--for
the
result
he
cared
nothing
victory
or
defeat
as
god
might
will
in
one
or
in
the
other
he
should
prove
himself
a
soldier
and
a
hero
he
should
vindicate
his
right
to
the
respect
of
his
men
and
the
companionship
of
his
brother
officers--to
the
consideration
of
his
superiors
how
his
heart
leaped
in
his
breast
as
the
bugle
sounded
the
stirring
notes
of
the
assembly
with
what
a
light
tread
scarcely
conscious
of
the
earth
beneath
his
feet
he
strode
forward
at
the
head
of
his
company
and
how
exultingly
he
noted
the
tactical
dispositions
which
placed
his
regiment
in
the
front
line
and
if
perchance
some
memory
came
to
him
of
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
that
might
take
on
a
tenderer
light
in
reading
the
account
of
that
day's
doings
who
shall
blame
him
for
the
unmartial
thought
or
count
it
a
debasement
of
soldierly
ardor
suddenly
from
the
forest
a
half-mile
in
front--apparently
from
among
the
upper
branches
of
the
trees
but
really
from
the
ridge
beyond--rose
a
tall
column
of
white
smoke
a
moment
later
came
a
deep
jarring
explosion
followed--almost
attended--by
a
hideous
rushing
sound
that
seemed
to
leap
forward
across
the
intervening
space
with
inconceivable
rapidity
rising
from
whisper
to
roar
with
too
quick
a
gradation
for
attention
to
note
the
successive
stages
of
its
horrible
progression
a
visible
tremor
ran
along
the
lines
of
men
all
were
startled
into
motion
captain
graffenreid
dodged
and
threw
up
his
hands
to
one
side
of
his
head
palms
outward
as
he
did
so
he
heard
a
keen
ringing
report
and
saw
on
a
hillside
behind
the
line
a
fierce
roll
of
smoke
and
dust--the
shell's
explosion
it
had
passed
a
hundred
feet
to
his
left
he
heard
or
fancied
he
heard
a
low
mocking
laugh
and
turning
in
the
direction
whence
it
came
saw
the
eyes
of
his
first
lieutenant
fixed
upon
him
with
an
unmistakable
look
of
amusement
he
looked
along
the
line
of
faces
in
the
front
ranks
the
men
were
laughing
at
him
the
thought
restored
the
color
to
his
bloodless
face--restored
too
much
of
it
his
cheeks
burned
with
a
fever
of
shame
the
enemy's
shot
was
not
answered
the
officer
in
command
at
that
exposed
part
of
the
line
had
evidently
no
desire
to
provoke
a
cannonade
for
the
forbearance
captain
graffenreid
was
conscious
of
a
sense
of
gratitude
he
had
not
known
that
the
flight
of
a
projectile
was
a
phenomenon
of
so
appalling
character
his
conception
of
war
had
already
undergone
a
profound
change
and
he
was
conscious
that
his
new
feeling
was
manifesting
itself
in
visible
perturbation
his
blood
was
boiling
in
his
veins
he
had
a
choking
sensation
and
felt
that
if
he
had
a
command
to
give
it
would
be
inaudible
or
at
least
unintelligible
the
hand
in
which
he
held
his
sword
trembled
the
other
moved
automatically
clutching
at
various
parts
of
his
clothing
he
found
a
difficulty
in
standing
still
and
fancied
that
his
men
observed
it
was
it
fear
he
feared
it
was
from
somewhere
away
to
the
right
came
as
the
wind
served
a
low
intermittent
murmur
like
that
of
ocean
in
a
storm--like
that
of
a
distant
railway
train--like
that
of
wind
among
the
pines--three
sounds
so
nearly
alike
that
the
ear
unaided
by
the
judgment
cannot
distinguish
them
one
from
another
the
eyes
of
the
troops
were
drawn
in
that
direction
the
mounted
officers
turned
their
field-glasses
that
way
mingled
with
the
sound
was
an
irregular
throbbing
he
thought
it
at
first
the
beating
of
his
fevered
blood
in
his
ears
next
the
distant
tapping
of
a
bass
drum
the
ball
is
opened
on
the
right
flank
said
an
officer
captain
graffenreid
understood
the
sounds
were
musketry
and
artillery
he
nodded
and
tried
to
smile
there
was
apparently
nothing
infectious
in
the
smile
presently
a
light
line
of
blue
smoke-puffs
broke
out
along
the
edge
of
the
wood
in
front
succeeded
by
a
crackle
of
rifles
there
were
keen
sharp
hissings
in
the
air
terminating
abruptly
with
a
thump
near
by
the
man
at
captain
graffenreid's
side
dropped
his
rifle
his
knees
gave
way
and
he
pitched
awkwardly
forward
falling
upon
his
face
somebody
shouted
lie
down
and
the
dead
man
was
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
living
it
looked
as
if
those
few
rifle-shots
had
slain
ten
thousand
men
only
the
field
officers
remained
erect
their
concession
to
the
emergency
consisted
in
dismounting
and
sending
their
horses
to
the
shelter
of
the
low
hills
immediately
in
rear
captain
graffenreid
lay
alongside
the
dead
man
from
beneath
whose
breast
flowed
a
little
rill
of
blood
it
had
a
faint
sweetish
odor
that
sickened
him
the
face
was
crushed
into
the
earth
and
flattened
it
looked
yellow
already
and
was
repulsive
nothing
suggested
the
glory
of
a
soldier's
death
nor
mitigated
the
loathsomeness
of
the
incident
he
could
not
turn
his
back
upon
the
body
without
facing
away
from
his
company
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
forest
where
all
again
was
silent
he
tried
to
imagine
what
was
going
on
there--the
lines
of
troops
forming
to
attack
the
guns
being
pushed
forward
by
hand
to
the
edge
of
the
open
he
fancied
he
could
see
their
black
muzzles
protruding
from
the
undergrowth
ready
to
deliver
their
storm
of
missiles--such
missiles
as
the
one
whose
shriek
had
so
unsettled
his
nerves
the
distension
of
his
eyes
became
painful
a
mist
seemed
to
gather
before
them
he
could
no
longer
see
across
the
field
yet
would
not
withdraw
his
gaze
lest
he
see
the
dead
man
at
his
side
the
fire
of
battle
was
not
now
burning
very
brightly
in
this
warrior's
soul
from
inaction
had
come
introspection
he
sought
rather
to
analyze
his
feelings
than
distinguish
himself
by
courage
and
devotion
the
result
was
profoundly
disappointing
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
groaned
aloud
the
hoarse
murmur
of
battle
grew
more
and
more
distinct
upon
the
right
the
murmur
had
indeed
become
a
roar
the
throbbing
a
thunder
the
sounds
had
worked
round
obliquely
to
the
front
evidently
the
enemy's
left
was
being
driven
back
and
the
propitious
moment
to
move
against
the
salient
angle
of
his
line
would
soon
arrive
the
silence
and
mystery
in
front
were
ominous
all
felt
that
they
boded
evil
to
the
assailants
behind
the
prostrate
lines
sounded
the
hoofbeats
of
galloping
horses
the
men
turned
to
look
a
dozen
staff
officers
were
riding
to
the
various
brigade
and
regimental
commanders
who
had
remounted
a
moment
more
and
there
was
a
chorus
of
voices
all
uttering
out
of
time
the
same
words--attention
battalion
the
men
sprang
to
their
feet
and
were
aligned
by
the
company
commanders
they
awaited
the
word
forward--
awaited
too
with
beating
hearts
and
set
teeth
the
gusts
of
lead
and
iron
that
were
to
smite
them
at
their
first
movement
in
obedience
to
that
word
the
word
was
not
given
the
tempest
did
not
break
out
the
delay
was
hideous
maddening
it
unnerved
like
a
respite
at
the
guillotine
captain
graffenreid
stood
at
the
head
of
his
company
the
dead
man
at
his
feet
he
heard
the
battle
on
the
right--rattle
and
crash
of
musketry
ceaseless
thunder
of
cannon
desultory
cheers
of
invisible
combatants
he
marked
ascending
clouds
of
smoke
from
distant
forests
he
noted
the
sinister
silence
of
the
forest
in
front
these
contrasting
extremes
affected
the
whole
range
of
his
sensibilities
the
strain
upon
his
nervous
organization
was
insupportable
he
grew
hot
and
cold
by
turns
he
panted
like
a
dog
and
then
forgot
to
breathe
until
reminded
by
vertigo
suddenly
he
grew
calm
glancing
downward
his
eyes
had
fallen
upon
his
naked
sword
as
he
held
it
point
to
earth
foreshortened
to
his
view
it
resembled
somewhat
he
thought
the
short
heavy
blade
of
the
ancient
roman
the
fancy
was
full
of
suggestion
malign
fateful
heroic
the
sergeant
in
the
rear
rank
immediately
behind
captain
graffenreid
now
observed
a
strange
sight
his
attention
drawn
by
an
uncommon
movement
made
by
the
captain--a
sudden
reaching
forward
of
the
hands
and
their
energetic
withdrawal
throwing
the
elbows
out
as
in
pulling
an
oar--he
saw
spring
from
between
the
officer's
shoulders
a
bright
point
of
metal
which
prolonged
itself
outward
nearly
a
half-arm's
length--a
blade
it
was
faintly
streaked
with
crimson
and
its
point
approached
so
near
to
the
sergeant's
breast
and
with
so
quick
a
movement
that
he
shrank
backward
in
alarm
that
moment
captain
graffenreid
pitched
heavily
forward
upon
the
dead
man
and
died
a
week
later
the
major-general
commanding
the
left
corps
of
the
federal
army
submitted
the
following
official
report
sir
i
have
the
honor
to
report
with
regard
to
the
action
of
the
19th
inst
that
owing
to
the
enemy's
withdrawal
from
my
front
to
reinforce
his
beaten
left
my
command
was
not
seriously
engaged
my
loss
was
as
follows
killed
one
officer
one
man
george
thurston
three
incidents
in
the
life
of
a
man
george
thurston
was
a
first
lieutenant
and
aide-de-camp
on
the
staff
of
colonel
brough
commanding
a
federal
brigade
colonel
brough
was
only
temporarily
in
command
as
senior
colonel
the
brigadier-general
having
been
severely
wounded
and
granted
a
leave
of
absence
to
recover
lieutenant
thurston
was
i
believe
of
colonel
brough's
regiment
to
which
with
his
chief
he
would
naturally
have
been
relegated
had
he
lived
till
our
brigade
commander's
recovery
the
aide
whose
place
thurston
took
had
been
killed
in
battle
thurston's
advent
among
us
was
the
only
change
in
the
personnel
of
our
staff
consequent
upon
the
change
in
commanders
we
did
not
like
him
he
was
unsocial
this
however
was
more
observed
by
others
than
by
me
whether
in
camp
or
on
the
march
in
barracks
in
tents
or
en
bivouac
my
duties
as
topographical
engineer
kept
me
working
like
a
beaver--all
day
in
the
saddle
and
half
the
night
at
my
drawing-table
platting
my
surveys
it
was
hazardous
work
the
nearer
to
the
enemy's
lines
i
could
penetrate
the
more
valuable
were
my
field
notes
and
the
resulting
maps
it
was
a
business
in
which
the
lives
of
men
counted
as
nothing
against
the
chance
of
defining
a
road
or
sketching
a
bridge
whole
squadrons
of
cavalry
escort
had
sometimes
to
be
sent
thundering
against
a
powerful
infantry
outpost
in
order
that
the
brief
time
between
the
charge
and
the
inevitable
retreat
might
be
utilized
in
sounding
a
ford
or
determining
the
point
of
intersection
of
two
roads
in
some
of
the
dark
corners
of
england
and
wales
they
have
an
immemorial
custom
of
beating
the
bounds
of
the
parish
on
a
certain
day
of
the
year
the
whole
population
turns
out
and
travels
in
procession
from
one
landmark
to
another
on
the
boundary
line
at
the
most
important
points
lads
are
soundly
beaten
with
rods
to
make
them
remember
the
place
in
after
life
they
become
authorities
our
frequent
engagements
with
the
confederate
outposts
patrols
and
scouting
parties
had
incidentally
the
same
educating
value
they
fixed
in
my
memory
a
vivid
and
apparently
imperishable
picture
of
the
locality--a
picture
serving
instead
of
accurate
field
notes
which
indeed
it
was
not
always
convenient
to
take
with
carbines
cracking
sabers
clashing
and
horses
plunging
all
about
these
spirited
encounters
were
observations
entered
in
red
one
morning
as
i
set
out
at
the
head
of
my
escort
on
an
expedition
of
more
than
the
usual
hazard
lieutenant
thurston
rode
up
alongside
and
asked
if
i
had
any
objection
to
his
accompanying
me
the
colonel
commanding
having
given
him
permission
none
whatever
i
replied
rather
gruffly
but
in
what
capacity
will
you
go
you
are
not
a
topographical
engineer
and
captain
burling
commands
my
escort
i
will
go
as
a
spectator
he
said
removing
his
sword-belt
and
taking
the
pistols
from
his
holsters
he
handed
them
to
his
servant
who
took
them
back
to
headquarters
i
realized
the
brutality
of
my
remark
but
not
clearly
seeing
my
way
to
an
apology
said
nothing
that
afternoon
we
encountered
a
whole
regiment
of
the
enemy's
cavalry
in
line
and
a
field-piece
that
dominated
a
straight
mile
of
the
turnpike
by
which
we
had
approached
my
escort
fought
deployed
in
the
woods
on
both
sides
but
thurston
remained
in
the
center
of
the
road
which
at
intervals
of
a
few
seconds
was
swept
by
gusts
of
grape
and
canister
that
tore
the
air
wide
open
as
they
passed
he
had
dropped
the
rein
on
the
neck
of
his
horse
and
sat
bolt
upright
in
the
saddle
with
folded
arms
soon
he
was
down
his
horse
torn
to
pieces
from
the
side
of
the
road
my
pencil
and
field
book
idle
my
duty
forgotten
i
watched
him
slowly
disengaging
himself
from
the
wreck
and
rising
at
that
instant
the
cannon
having
ceased
firing
a
burly
confederate
trooper
on
a
spirited
horse
dashed
like
a
thunderbolt
down
the
road
with
drawn
saber
thurston
saw
him
coming
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
again
folded
his
arms
he
was
too
brave
to
retreat
before
the
word
and
my
uncivil
words
had
disarmed
him
he
was
a
spectator
another
moment
and
he
would
have
been
split
like
a
mackerel
but
a
blessed
bullet
tumbled
his
assailant
into
the
dusty
road
so
near
that
the
impetus
sent
the
body
rolling
to
thurston's
feet
that
evening
while
platting
my
hasty
survey
i
found
time
to
frame
an
apology
which
i
think
took
the
rude
primitive
form
of
a
confession
that
i
had
spoken
like
a
malicious
idiot
a
few
weeks
later
a
part
of
our
army
made
an
assault
upon
the
enemy's
left
the
attack
which
was
made
upon
an
unknown
position
and
across
unfamiliar
ground
was
led
by
our
brigade
the
ground
was
so
broken
and
the
underbrush
so
thick
that
all
mounted
officers
and
men
were
compelled
to
fight
on
foot--the
brigade
commander
and
his
staff
included
in
the
mãªlã©e
thurston
was
parted
from
the
rest
of
us
and
we
found
him
horribly
wounded
only
when
we
had
taken
the
enemy's
last
defense
he
was
some
months
in
hospital
at
nashville
tennessee
but
finally
rejoined
us
he
said
little
about
his
misadventure
except
that
he
had
been
bewildered
and
had
strayed
into
the
enemy's
lines
and
been
shot
down
but
from
one
of
his
captors
whom
we
in
turn
had
captured
we
learned
the
particulars
he
came
walking
right
upon
us
as
we
lay
in
line
said
this
man
a
whole
company
of
us
instantly
sprang
up
and
leveled
our
rifles
at
his
breast
some
of
them
almost
touching
him
'throw
down
that
sword
and
surrender
you
damned
yank'
shouted
some
one
in
authority
the
fellow
ran
his
eyes
along
the
line
of
rifle
barrels
folded
his
arms
across
his
breast
his
right
hand
still
clutching
his
sword
and
deliberately
replied
'i
will
not'
if
we
had
all
fired
he
would
have
been
torn
to
shreds
some
of
us
didn't
i
didn't
for
one
nothing
could
have
induced
me
when
one
is
tranquilly
looking
death
in
the
eye
and
refusing
him
any
concession
one
naturally
has
a
good
opinion
of
one's
self
i
don't
know
if
it
was
this
feeling
that
in
thurston
found
expression
in
a
stiffish
attitude
and
folded
arms
at
the
mess
table
one
day
in
his
absence
another
explanation
was
suggested
by
our
quartermaster
an
irreclaimable
stammerer
when
the
wine
was
in
it's
h--is
w--ay
of
m-m-mastering
a
c-c-consti-t-tu-tional
t-tendency
to
r--un
aw--ay
what
i
flamed
out
indignantly
rising
you
intimate
that
thurston
is
a
coward--and
in
his
absence
if
he
w--ere
a
cow--wow-ard
h--e
w--wouldn't
t-try
to
m-m-master
it
and
if
he
w--ere
p-present
i
w--wouldn't
d-d-dare
to
d-d-discuss
it
was
the
mollifying
reply
this
intrepid
man
george
thurston
died
an
ignoble
death
the
brigade
was
in
camp
with
headquarters
in
a
grove
of
immense
trees
to
an
upper
branch
of
one
of
these
a
venturesome
climber
had
attached
the
two
ends
of
a
long
rope
and
made
a
swing
with
a
length
of
not
less
than
one
hundred
feet
plunging
downward
from
a
height
of
fifty
feet
along
the
arc
of
a
circle
with
such
a
radius
soaring
to
an
equal
altitude
pausing
for
one
breathless
instant
then
sweeping
dizzily
backward--no
one
who
has
not
tried
it
can
conceive
the
terrors
of
such
sport
to
the
novice
thurston
came
out
of
his
tent
one
day
and
asked
for
instruction
in
the
mystery
of
propelling
the
swing--the
art
of
rising
and
sitting
which
every
boy
has
mastered
in
a
few
moments
he
had
acquired
the
trick
and
was
swinging
higher
than
the
most
experienced
of
us
had
dared
we
shuddered
to
look
at
his
fearful
flights
st-t-top
him
said
the
quartermaster
snailing
lazily
along
from
the
mess-tent
where
he
had
been
lunching
h--e
d-doesn't
know
that
if
h--e
g-g-goes
c-clear
over
h--e'll
w--ind
up
the
sw--ing
with
such
energy
was
that
strong
man
cannonading
himself
through
the
air
that
at
each
extremity
of
his
increasing
arc
his
body
standing
in
the
swing
was
almost
horizontal
should
he
once
pass
above
the
level
of
the
rope's
attachment
he
would
be
lost
the
rope
would
slacken
and
he
would
fall
vertically
to
a
point
as
far
below
as
he
had
gone
above
and
then
the
sudden
tension
of
the
rope
would
wrest
it
from
his
hands
all
saw
the
peril--all
cried
out
to
him
to
desist
and
gesticulated
at
him
as
indistinct
and
with
a
noise
like
the
rush
of
a
cannon
shot
in
flight
he
swept
past
us
through
the
lower
reaches
of
his
hideous
oscillation
a
woman
standing
at
a
little
distance
away
fainted
and
fell
unobserved
men
from
the
camp
of
a
regiment
near
by
ran
in
crowds
to
see
all
shouting
suddenly
as
thurston
was
on
his
upward
curve
the
shouts
all
ceased
thurston
and
the
swing
had
parted--that
is
all
that
can
be
known
both
hands
at
once
had
released
the
rope
the
impetus
of
the
light
swing
exhausted
it
was
falling
back
the
man's
momentum
was
carrying
him
almost
erect
upward
and
forward
no
longer
in
his
arc
but
with
an
outward
curve
it
could
have
been
but
an
instant
yet
it
seemed
an
age
i
cried
out
or
thought
i
cried
out
my
god
will
he
never
stop
going
up
he
passed
close
to
the
branch
of
a
tree
i
remember
a
feeling
of
delight
as
i
thought
he
would
clutch
it
and
save
himself
i
speculated
on
the
possibility
of
it
sustaining
his
weight
he
passed
above
it
and
from
my
point
of
view
was
sharply
outlined
against
the
blue
at
this
distance
of
many
years
i
can
distinctly
recall
that
image
of
a
man
in
the
sky
its
head
erect
its
feet
close
together
its
hands--i
do
not
see
its
hands
all
at
once
with
astonishing
suddenness
and
rapidity
it
turns
clear
over
and
pitches
downward
there
is
another
cry
from
the
crowd
which
has
rushed
instinctively
forward
the
man
has
become
merely
a
whirling
object
mostly
legs
then
there
is
an
indescribable
sound--
the
sound
of
an
impact
that
shakes
the
earth
and
these
men
familiar
with
death
in
its
most
awful
aspects
turn
sick
many
walk
unsteadily
away
from
the
spot
others
support
themselves
against
the
trunks
of
trees
or
sit
at
the
roots
death
has
taken
an
unfair
advantage
he
has
struck
with
an
unfamiliar
weapon
he
has
executed
a
new
and
disquieting
stratagem
we
did
not
know
that
he
had
so
ghastly
resources
possibilities
of
terror
so
dismal
thurston's
body
lay
on
its
back
one
leg
bent
beneath
was
broken
above
the
knee
and
the
bone
driven
into
the
earth
the
abdomen
had
burst
the
bowels

the

the
time
a
pleasant
sunday
afternoon
in
the
early
autumn
of
1861
the
place
a
forest's
heart
in
the
mountain
region
of
southwestern
virginia
private
grayrock
of
the
federal
army
is
discovered
seated
comfortably
at
the
root
of
a
great
pine
tree
against
which
he
leans
his
legs
extended
straight
along
the
ground
his
rifle
lying
across
his
thighs
his
hands
clasped
in
order
that
they
may
not
fall
away
to
his
sides
resting
upon
the
barrel
of
the
weapon
the
contact
of
the
back
of
his
head
with
the
tree
has
pushed
his
cap
downward
over
his
eyes
almost
concealing
them
one
seeing
him
would
say
that
he
slept
private
grayrock
did
not
sleep
to
have
done
so
would
have
imperiled
the
interests
of
the
united
states
for
he
was
a
long
way
outside
the
lines
and
subject
to
capture
or
death
at
the
hands
of
the
enemy
moreover
he
was
in
a
frame
of
mind
unfavorable
to
repose
the
cause
of
his
perturbation
of
spirit
was
this
during
the
previous
night
he
had
served
on
the
picket-guard
and
had
been
posted
as
a
sentinel
in
this
very
forest
the
night
was
clear
though
moonless
but
in
the
gloom
of
the
wood
the
darkness
was
deep
grayrock's
post
was
at
a
considerable
distance
from
those
to
right
and
left
for
the
pickets
had
been
thrown
out
a
needless
distance
from
the
camp
making
the
line
too
long
for
the
force
detailed
to
occupy
it
the
war
was
young
and
military
camps
entertained
the
error
that
while
sleeping
they
were
better
protected
by
thin
lines
a
long
way
out
toward
the
enemy
than
by
thicker
ones
close
in
and
surely
they
needed
as
long
notice
as
possible
of
an
enemy's
approach
for
they
were
at
that
time
addicted
to
the
practice
of
undressing--than
which
nothing
could
be
more
unsoldierly
on
the
morning
of
the
memorable
6th
of
april
at
shiloh
many
of
grant's
men
when
spitted
on
confederate
bayonets
were
as
naked
as
civilians
but
it
should
be
allowed
that
this
was
not
because
of
any
defect
in
their
picket
line
their
error
was
of
another
sort
they
had
no
pickets
this
is
perhaps
a
vain
digression
i
should
not
care
to
undertake
to
interest
the
reader
in
the
fate
of
an
army
what
we
have
here
to
consider
is
that
of
private
grayrock
for
two
hours
after
he
had
been
left
at
his
lonely
post
that
saturday
night
he
stood
stock-still
leaning
against
the
trunk
of
a
large
tree
staring
into
the
darkness
in
his
front
and
trying
to
recognize
known
objects
for
he
had
been
posted
at
the
same
spot
during
the
day
but
all
was
now
different
he
saw
nothing
in
detail
but
only
groups
of
things
whose
shapes
not
observed
when
there
was
something
more
of
them
to
observe
were
now
unfamiliar
they
seemed
not
to
have
been
there
before
a
landscape
that
is
all
trees
and
undergrowth
moreover
lacks
definition
is
confused
and
without
accentuated
points
upon
which
attention
can
gain
a
foothold
add
the
gloom
of
a
moonless
night
and
something
more
than
great
natural
intelligence
and
a
city
education
is
required
to
preserve
one's
knowledge
of
direction
and
that
is
how
it
occurred
that
private
grayrock
after
vigilantly
watching
the
spaces
in
his
front
and
then
imprudently
executing
a
circumspection
of
his
whole
dimly
visible
environment
silently
walking
around
his
tree
to
accomplish
it
lost
his
bearings
and
seriously
impaired
his
usefulness
as
a
sentinel
lost
at
his
post--unable
to
say
in
which
direction
to
look
for
an
enemy's
approach
and
in
which
lay
the
sleeping
camp
for
whose
security
he
was
accountable
with
his
life--conscious
too
of
many
another
awkward
feature
of
the
situation
and
of
considerations
affecting
his
own
safety
private
grayrock
was
profoundly
disquieted
nor
was
he
given
time
to
recover
his
tranquillity
for
almost
at
the
moment
that
he
realized
his
awkward
predicament
he
heard
a
stir
of
leaves
and
a
snap
of
fallen
twigs
and
turning
with
a
stilled
heart
in
the
direction
whence
it
came
saw
in
the
gloom
the
indistinct
outlines
of
a
human
figure
halt
shouted
private
grayrock
peremptorily
as
in
duty
bound
backing
up
the
command
with
the
sharp
metallic
snap
of
his
cocking
rifle--who
goes
there
there
was
no
answer
at
least
there
was
an
instant's
hesitation
and
the
answer
if
it
came
was
lost
in
the
report
of
the
sentinel's
rifle
in
the
silence
of
the
night
and
the
forest
the
sound
was
deafening
and
hardly
had
it
died
away
when
it
was
repeated
by
the
pieces
of
the
pickets
to
right
and
left
a
sympathetic
fusillade
for
two
hours
every
unconverted
civilian
of
them
had
been
evolving
enemies
from
his
imagination
and
peopling
the
woods
in
his
front
with
them
and
grayrock's
shot
had
started
the
whole
encroaching
host
into
visible
existence
having
fired
all
retreated
breathless
to
the
reserves--all
but
grayrock
who
did
not
know
in
what
direction
to
retreat
when
no
enemy
appearing
the
roused
camp
two
miles
away
had
undressed
and
got
itself
into
bed
again
and
the
picket
line
was
cautiously
re-established
he
was
discovered
bravely
holding
his
ground
and
was
complimented
by
the
officer
of
the
guard
as
the
one
soldier
of
that
devoted
band
who
could
rightly
be
considered
the
moral
equivalent
of
that
uncommon
unit
of
value
a
whoop
in
hell
in
the
mean
time
however
grayrock
had
made
a
close
but
unavailing
search
for
the
mortal
part
of
the
intruder
at
whom
he
had
fired
and
whom
he
had
a
marksman's
intuitive
sense
of
having
hit
for
he
was
one
of
those
born
experts
who
shoot
without
aim
by
an
instinctive
sense
of
direction
and
are
nearly
as
dangerous
by
night
as
by
day
during
a
full
half
of
his
twenty-four
years
he
had
been
a
terror
to
the
targets
of
all
the
shooting-galleries
in
three
cities
unable
now
to
produce
his
dead
game
he
had
the
discretion
to
hold
his
tongue
and
was
glad
to
observe
in
his
officer
and
comrades
the
natural
assumption
that
not
having
run
away
he
had
seen
nothing
hostile
his
honorable
mention
had
been
earned
by
not
running
away
anyhow
nevertheless
private
grayrock
was
far
from
satisfied
with
the
night's
adventure
and
when
the
next
day
he
made
some
fair
enough
pretext
to
apply
for
a
pass
to
go
outside
the
lines
and
the
general
commanding
promptly
granted
it
in
recognition
of
his
bravery
the
night
before
he
passed
out
at
the
point
where
that
had
been
displayed
telling
the
sentinel
then
on
duty
there
that
he
had
lost
something--which
was
true
enough--he
renewed
the
search
for
the
person
whom
he
supposed
himself
to
have
shot
and
whom
if
only
wounded
he
hoped
to
trail
by
the
blood
he
was
no
more
successful
by
daylight
than
he
had
been
in
the
darkness
and
after
covering
a
wide
area
and
boldly
penetrating
a
long
distance
into
the
confederacy
he
gave
up
the
search
somewhat
fatigued
seated
himself
at
the
root
of
the
great
pine
tree
where
we
have
seen
him
and
indulged
his
disappointment
it
is
not
to
be
inferred
that
grayrock's
was
the
chagrin
of
a
cruel
nature
balked
of
its
bloody
deed
in
the
clear
large
eyes
finely
wrought
lips
and
broad
forehead
of
that
young
man
one
could
read
quite
another
story
and
in
point
of
fact
his
character
was
a
singularly
felicitous
compound
of
boldness
and
sensibility
courage
and
conscience
i
find
myself
disappointed
he
said
to
himself
sitting
there
at
the
bottom
of
the
golden
haze
submerging
the
forest
like
a
subtler
sea--
disappointed
in
failing
to
discover
a
fellow-man
dead
by
my
hand
do
i
then
really
wish
that
i
had
taken
life
in
the
performance
of
a
duty
as
well
performed
without
what
more
could
i
wish
if
any
danger
threatened
my
shot
averted
it
that
is
what
i
was
there
to
do
no
i
am
glad
indeed
if
no
human
life
was
needlessly
extinguished
by
me
but
i
am
in
a
false
position
i
have
suffered
myself
to
be
complimented
by
my
officers
and
envied
by
my
comrades
the
camp
is
ringing
with
praise
of
my
courage
that
is
not
just
i
know
myself
courageous
but
this
praise
is
for
specific
acts
which
i
did
not
perform
or
performed--otherwise
it
is
believed
that
i
remained
at
my
post
bravely
without
firing
whereas
it
was
i
who
began
the
fusillade
and
i
did
not
retreat
in
the
general
alarm
because
bewildered
what
then
shall
i
do
explain
that
i
saw
an
enemy
and
fired
they
have
all
said
that
of
themselves
yet
none
believes
it
shall
i
tell
a
truth
which
discrediting
my
courage
will
have
the
effect
of
a
lie
ugh
it
is
an
ugly
business
altogether
i
wish
to
god
i
could
find
my
man
and
so
wishing
private
grayrock
overcome
at
last
by
the
languor
of
the
afternoon
and
lulled
by
the
stilly
sounds
of
insects
droning
and
prosing
in
certain
fragrant
shrubs
so
far
forgot
the
interests
of
the
united
states
as
to
fall
asleep
and
expose
himself
to
capture
and
sleeping
he
dreamed
he
thought
himself
a
boy
living
in
a
far
fair
land
by
the
border
of
a
great
river
upon
which
the
tall
steamboats
moved
grandly
up
and
down
beneath
their
towering
evolutions
of
black
smoke
which
announced
them
long
before
they
had
rounded
the
bends
and
marked
their
movements
when
miles
out
of
sight
with
him
always
at
his
side
as
he
watched
them
was
one
to
whom
he
gave
his
heart
and
soul
in
love--a
twin
brother
together
they
strolled
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
together
explored
the
fields
lying
farther
away
from
it
and
gathered
pungent
mints
and
sticks
of
fragrant
sassafras
in
the
hills
overlooking
all--beyond
which
lay
the
realm
of
conjecture
and
from
which
looking
southward
across
the
great
river
they
caught
glimpses
of
the
enchanted
land
hand
in
hand
and
heart
in
heart
they
two
the
only
children
of
a
widowed
mother
walked
in
paths
of
light
through
valleys
of
peace
seeing
new
things
under
a
new
sun
and
through
all
the
golden
days
floated
one
unceasing
sound--
the
rich
thrilling
melody
of
a
mocking-bird
in
a
cage
by
the
cottage
door
it
pervaded
and
possessed
all
the
spiritual
intervals
of
the
dream
like
a
musical
benediction
the
joyous
bird
was
always
in
song
its
infinitely
various
notes
seemed
to
flow
from
its
throat
effortless
in
bubbles
and
rills
at
each
heart-beat
like
the
waters
of
a
pulsing
spring
that
fresh
clear
melody
seemed
indeed
the
spirit
of
the
scene
the
meaning
and
interpretation
to
sense
of
the
mysteries
of
life
and
love
but
there
came
a
time
when
the
days
of
the
dream
grew
dark
with
sorrow
in
a
rain
of
tears
the
good
mother
was
dead
the
meadowside
home
by
the
great
river
was
broken
up
and
the
brothers
were
parted
between
two
of
their
kinsmen
william
the
dreamer
went
to
live
in
a
populous
city
in
the
realm
of
conjecture
and
john
crossing
the
river
into
the
enchanted
land
was
taken
to
a
distant
region
whose
people
in
their
lives
and
ways
were
said
to
be
strange
and
wicked
to
him
in
the
distribution
of
the
dead
mother's
estate
had
fallen
all
that
they
deemed
of
value--the
mocking-bird
they
could
be
divided
but
it
could
not
so
it
was
carried
away
into
the
strange
country
and
the
world
of
william
knew
it
no
more
forever
yet
still
through
the
aftertime
of
his
loneliness
its
song
filled
all
the
dream
and
seemed
always
sounding
in
his
ear
and
in
his
heart
the
kinsmen
who
had
adopted
the
boys
were
enemies
holding
no
communication
for
a
time
letters
full
of
boyish
bravado
and
boastful
narratives
of
the
new
and
larger
experience--grotesque
descriptions
of
their
widening
lives
and
the
new
worlds
they
had
conquered--passed
between
them
but
these
gradually
became
less
frequent
and
with
william's
removal
to
another
and
greater
city
ceased
altogether
but
ever
through
it
all
ran
the
song
of
the
mocking-bird
and
when
the
dreamer
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
through
the
vistas
of
the
pine
forest
the
cessation
of
its
music
first
apprised
him
that
he
was
awake
the
sun
was
low
and
red
in
the
west
the
level
rays
projected
from
the
trunk
of
each
giant
pine
a
wall
of
shadow
traversing
the
golden
haze
to
eastward
until
light
and
shade
were
blended
in
undistinguishable
blue
private
grayrock
rose
to
his
feet
looked
cautiously
about
him
shouldered
his
rifle
and
set
off
toward
camp
he
had
gone
perhaps
a
half-mile
and
was
passing
a
thicket
of
laurel
when
a
bird
rose
from
the
midst
of
it
and
perching
on
the
branch
of
a
tree
above
poured
from
its
joyous
breast
so
inexhaustible
floods
of
song
as
but
one
of
all
god's
creatures
can
utter
in
his
praise
there
was
little
in
that--it
was
only
to
open
the
bill
and
breathe
yet
the
man
stopped
as
if
struck
--stopped
and
let
fall
his
rifle
looked
upward
at
the
bird
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
and
wept
like
a
child
for
the
moment
he
was
indeed
a
child
in
spirit
and
in
memory
dwelling
again
by
the
great
river
over-against
the
enchanted
land
then
with
an
effort
of
the
will
he
pulled
himself
together
picked
up
his
weapon
and
audibly
damning
himself
for
an
idiot
strode
on
passing
an
opening
that
reached
into
the
heart
of
the
little
thicket
he
looked
in
and
there
supine
upon
the
earth
its
arms
all
abroad
its
gray
uniform
stained
with
a
single
spot
of
blood
upon
the
breast
its
white
face
turned
sharply
upward
and
backward
lay
the
image
of
himself--the
body
of
john
grayrock
dead
of
a
gunshot
wound
and
still
warm
he
had
found
his
man
as
the
unfortunate
soldier
knelt
beside
that
masterwork
of
civil
war
the
shrilling
bird
upon
the
bough
overhead
stilled
her
song
and
flushed
with
sunset's
crimson
glory
glided
silently
away
through
the
solemn
spaces
of
the
wood
at
roll-call
that
evening
in
the
federal
camp
the
name
william
grayrock
brought
no
response
nor
ever
again
there-after
civilians
the
man
out
of
the
nose
at
the
intersection
of
two
certain
streets
in
that
part
of
san
francisco
known
by
the
rather
loosely
applied
name
of
north
beach
is
a
vacant
lot
which
is
rather
more
nearly
level
than
is
usually
the
case
with
lots
vacant
or
otherwise
in
that
region
immediately
at
the
back
of
it
to
the
south
however
the
ground
slopes
steeply
upward
the
acclivity
broken
by
three
terraces
cut
into
the
soft
rock
it
is
a
place
for
goats
and
poor
persons
several
families
of
each
class
having
occupied
it
jointly
and
amicably
from
the
foundation
of
the
city
one
of
the
humble
habitations
of
the
lowest
terrace
is
noticeable
for
its
rude
resemblance
to
the
human
face
or
rather
to
such
a
simulacrum
of
it
as
a
boy
might
cut
out
of
a
hollowed
pumpkin
meaning
no
offense
to
his
race
the
eyes
are
two
circular
windows
the
nose
is
a
door
the
mouth
an
aperture
caused
by
removal
of
a
board
below
there
are
no
doorsteps
as
a
face
this
house
is
too
large
as
a
dwelling
too
small
the
blank
unmeaning
stare
of
its
lidless
and
browless
eyes
is
uncanny
sometimes
a
man
steps
out
of
the
nose
turns
passes
the
place
where
the
right
ear
should
be
and
making
his
way
through
the
throng
of
children
and
goats
obstructing
the
narrow
walk
between
his
neighbors'
doors
and
the
edge
of
the
terrace
gains
the
street
by
descending
a
flight
of
rickety
stairs
here
he
pauses
to
consult
his
watch
and
the
stranger
who
happens
to
pass
wonders
why
such
a
man
as
that
can
care
what
is
the
hour
longer
observations
would
show
that
the
time
of
day
is
an
important
element
in
the
man's
movements
for
it
is
at
precisely
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
that
he
comes
forth
365
times
in
every
year
having
satisfied
himself
that
he
has
made
no
mistake
in
the
hour
he
replaces
the
watch
and
walks
rapidly
southward
up
the
street
two
squares
turns
to
the
right
and
as
he
approaches
the
next
corner
fixes
his
eyes
on
an
upper
window
in
a
three-story
building
across
the
way
this
is
a
somewhat
dingy
structure
originally
of
red
brick
and
now
gray
it
shows
the
touch
of
age
and
dust
built
for
a
dwelling
it
is
now
a
factory
i
do
not
know
what
is
made
there
the
things
that
are
commonly
made
in
a
factory
i
suppose
i
only
know
that
at
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
of
every
day
but
sunday
it
is
full
of
activity
and
clatter
pulsations
of
some
great
engine
shake
it
and
there
are
recurrent
screams
of
wood
tormented
by
the
saw
at
the
window
on
which
the
man
fixes
an
intensely
expectant
gaze
nothing
ever
appears
the
glass
in
truth
has
such
a
coating
of
dust
that
it
has
long
ceased
to
be
transparent
the
man
looks
at
it
without
stopping
he
merely
keeps
turning
his
head
more
and
more
backward
as
he
leaves
the
building
behind
passing
along
to
the
next
corner
he
turns
to
the
left
goes
round
the
block
and
comes
back
till
he
reaches
the
point
diagonally
across
the
street
from
the
factory--point
on
his
former
course
which
he
then
retraces
looking
frequently
backward
over
his
right
shoulder
at
the
window
while
it
is
in
sight
for
many
years
he
has
not
been
known
to
vary
his
route
nor
to
introduce
a
single
innovation
into
his
action
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
is
again
at
the
mouth
of
his
dwelling
and
a
woman
who
has
for
some
time
been
standing
in
the
nose
assists
him
to
enter
he
is
seen
no
more
until
two
o'clock
the
next
day
the
woman
is
his
wife
she
supports
herself
and
him
by
washing
for
the
poor
people
among
whom
they
live
at
rates
which
destroy
chinese
and
domestic
competition
this
man
is
about
fifty-seven
years
of
age
though
he
looks
greatly
older
his
hair
is
dead
white
he
wears
no
beard
and
is
always
newly
shaven
his
hands
are
clean
his
nails
well
kept
in
the
matter
of
dress
he
is
distinctly
superior
to
his
position
as
indicated
by
his
surroundings
and
the
business
of
his
wife
he
is
indeed
very
neatly
if
not
quite
fashionably
clad
his
silk
hat
has
a
date
no
earlier
than
the
year
before
the
last
and
his
boots
scrupulously
polished
are
innocent
of
patches
i
am
told
that
the
suit
which
he
wears
during
his
daily
excursions
of
fifteen
minutes
is
not
the
one
that
he
wears
at
home
like
everything
else
that
he
has
this
is
provided
and
kept
in
repair
by
the
wife
and
is
renewed
as
frequently
as
her
scanty
means
permit
thirty
years
ago
john
hardshaw
and
his
wife
lived
on
rincon
hill
in
one
of
the
finest
residences
of
that
once
aristocratic
quarter
he
had
once
been
a
physician
but
having
inherited
a
considerable
estate
from
his
father
concerned
himself
no
more
about
the
ailments
of
his
fellow-creatures
and
found
as
much
work
as
he
cared
for
in
managing
his
own
affairs
both
he
and
his
wife
were
highly
cultivated
persons
and
their
house
was
frequented
by
a
small
set
of
such
men
and
women
as
persons
of
their
tastes
would
think
worth
knowing
so
far
as
these
knew
mr
and
mrs
hardshaw
lived
happily
together
certainly
the
wife
was
devoted
to
her
handsome
and
accomplished
husband
and
exceedingly
proud
of
him
among
their
acquaintances
were
the
barwells--man
wife
and
two
young
children--of
sacramento
mr
barwell
was
a
civil
and
mining
engineer
whose
duties
took
him
much
from
home
and
frequently
to
san
francisco
on
these
occasions
his
wife
commonly
accompanied
him
and
passed
much
of
her
time
at
the
house
of
her
friend
mrs
hardshaw
always
with
her
two
children
of
whom
mrs
hardshaw
childless
herself
grew
fond
unluckily
her
husband
grew
equally
fond
of
their
mother--a
good
deal
fonder
still
more
unluckily
that
attractive
lady
was
less
wise
than
weak
at
about
three
o'clock
one
autumn
morning
officer
no
13
of
the
sacramento
police
saw
a
man
stealthily
leaving
the
rear
entrance
of
a
gentleman's
residence
and
promptly
arrested
him
the
man--who
wore
a
slouch
hat
and
shaggy
overcoat--offered
the
policeman
one
hundred
then
five
hundred
then
one
thousand
dollars
to
be
released
as
he
had
less
than
the
first
mentioned
sum
on
his
person
the
officer
treated
his
proposal
with
virtuous
contempt
before
reaching
the
station
the
prisoner
agreed
to
give
him
a
check
for
ten
thousand
dollars
and
remain
ironed
in
the
willows
along
the
river
bank
until
it
should
be
paid
as
this
only
provoked
new
derision
he
would
say
no
more
merely
giving
an
obviously
fictitious
name
when
he
was
searched
at
the
station
nothing
of
value
was
found
on
him
but
a
miniature
portrait
of
mrs
barwell--the
lady
of
the
house
at
which
he
was
caught
the
case
was
set
with
costly
diamonds
and
something
in
the
quality
of
the
man's
linen
sent
a
pang
of
unavailing
regret
through
the
severely
incorruptible
bosom
of
officer
no
13
there
was
nothing
about
the
prisoner's
clothing
nor
person
to
identify
him
and
he
was
booked
for
burglary
under
the
name
that
he
had
given
the
honorable
name
of
john
k
smith
the
k
was
an
inspiration
upon
which
doubtless
he
greatly
prided
himself
in
the
mean
time
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
john
hardshaw
was
agitating
the
gossips
of
rincon
hill
in
san
francisco
and
was
even
mentioned
in
one
of
the
newspapers
it
did
not
occur
to
the
lady
whom
that
journal
considerately
described
as
his
widow
to
look
for
him
in
the
city
prison
at
sacramento--a
town
which
he
was
not
known
ever
to
have
visited
as
john
k
smith
he
was
arraigned
and
waiving
examination
committed
for
trial
about
two
weeks
before
the
trial
mrs
hardshaw
accidentally
learning
that
her
husband
was
held
in
sacramento
under
an
assumed
name
on
a
charge
of
burglary
hastened
to
that
city
without
daring
to
mention
the
matter
to
any
one
and
presented
herself
at
the
prison
asking
for
an
interview
with
her
husband
john
k
smith
haggard
and
ill
with
anxiety
wearing
a
plain
traveling
wrap
which
covered
her
from
neck
to
foot
and
in
which
she
had
passed
the
night
on
the
steamboat
too
anxious
to
sleep
she
hardly
showed
for
what
she
was
but
her
manner
pleaded
for
her
more
strongly
than
anything
that
she
chose
to
say
in
evidence
of
her
right
to
admittance
she
was
permitted
to
see
him
alone
what
occurred
during
that
distressing
interview
has
never
transpired
but
later
events
prove
that
hardshaw
had
found
means
to
subdue
her
will
to
his
own
she
left
the
prison
a
broken-hearted
woman
refusing
to
answer
a
single
question
and
returning
to
her
desolate
home
renewed
in
a
half-hearted
way
her
inquiries
for
her
missing
husband
a
week
later
she
was
herself
missing
she
had
gone
back
to
the
states--nobody
knew
any
more
than
that
on
his
trial
the
prisoner
pleaded
guilty--by
advice
of
his
counsel
so
his
counsel
said
nevertheless
the
judge
in
whose
mind
several
unusual
circumstances
had
created
a
doubt
insisted
on
the
district
attorney
placing
officer
no
13
on
the
stand
and
the
deposition
of
mrs
barwell
who
was
too
ill
to
attend
was
read
to
the
jury
it
was
very
brief
she
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
except
that
the
likeness
of
herself
was
her
property
and
had
she
thought
been
left
on
the
parlor
table
when
she
had
retired
on
the
night
of
the
arrest
she
had
intended
it
as
a
present
to
her
husband
then
and
still
absent
in
europe
on
business
for
a
mining
company
this
witness's
manner
when
making
the
deposition
at
her
residence
was
afterward
described
by
the
district
attorney
as
most
extraordinary
twice
she
had
refused
to
testify
and
once
when
the
deposition
lacked
nothing
but
her
signature
she
had
caught
it
from
the
clerk's
hands
and
torn
it
in
pieces
she
had
called
her
children
to
the
bedside
and
embraced
them
with
streaming
eyes
then
suddenly
sending
them
from
the
room
she
verified
her
statement
by
oath
and
signature
and
fainted--
slick
away
said
the
district
attorney
it
was
at
that
time
that
her
physician
arriving
upon
the
scene
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
and
grasping
the
representative
of
the
law
by
the
collar
chucked
him
into
the
street
and
kicked
his
assistant
after
him
the
insulted
majesty
of
the
law
was
not
vindicated
the
victim
of
the
indignity
did
not
even
mention
anything
of
all
this
in
court
he
was
ambitious
to
win
his
case
and
the
circumstances
of
the
taking
of
that
deposition
were
not
such
as
would
give
it
weight
if
related
and
after
all
the
man
on
trial
had
committed
an
offense
against
the
law's
majesty
only
less
heinous
than
that
of
the
irascible
physician
by
suggestion
of
the
judge
the
jury
rendered
a
verdict
of
guilty
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
and
the
prisoner
was
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
for
three
years
his
counsel
who
had
objected
to
nothing
and
had
made
no
plea
for
lenity--had
in
fact
hardly
said
a
word--wrung
his
client's
hand
and
left
the
room
it
was
obvious
to
the
whole
bar
that
he
had
been
engaged
only
to
prevent
the
court
from
appointing
counsel
who
might
possibly
insist
on
making
a
defense
john
hardshaw
served
out
his
term
at
san
quentin
and
when
discharged
was
met
at
the
prison
gates
by
his
wife
who
had
returned
from
the
states
to
receive
him
it
is
thought
they
went
straight
to
europe
anyhow
a
general
power-of-attorney
to
a
lawyer
still
living
among
us--
from
whom
i
have
many
of
the
facts
of
this
simple
history--was
executed
in
paris
this
lawyer
in
a
short
time
sold
everything
that
hardshaw
owned
in
california
and
for
years
nothing
was
heard
of
the
unfortunate
couple
though
many
to
whose
ears
had
come
vague
and
inaccurate
intimations
of
their
strange
story
and
who
had
known
them
recalled
their
personality
with
tenderness
and
their
misfortunes
with
compassion
some
years
later
they
returned
both
broken
in
fortune
and
spirits
and
he
in
health
the
purpose
of
their
return
i
have
not
been
able
to
ascertain
for
some
time
they
lived
under
the
name
of
johnson
in
a
respectable
enough
quarter
south
of
market
street
pretty
well
put
and
were
never
seen
away
from
the
vicinity
of
their
dwelling
they
must
have
had
a
little
money
left
for
it
is
not
known
that
the
man
had
any
occupation
the
state
of
his
health
probably
not
permitting
the
woman's
devotion
to
her
invalid
husband
was
matter
of
remark
among
their
neighbors
she
seemed
never
absent
from
his
side
and
always
supporting
and
cheering
him
they
would
sit
for
hours
on
one
of
the
benches
in
a
little
public
park
she
reading
to
him
his
hand
in
hers
her
light
touch
occasionally
visiting
his
pale
brow
her
still
beautiful
eyes
frequently
lifted
from
the
book
to
look
into
his
as
she
made
some
comment
on
the
text
or
closed
the
volume
to
beguile
his
mood
with
talk
of--what
nobody
ever
overheard
a
conversation
between
these
two
the
reader
who
has
had
the
patience
to
follow
their
history
to
this
point
may
possibly
find
a
pleasure
in
conjecture
there
was
probably
something
to
be
avoided
the
bearing
of
the
man
was
one
of
profound
dejection
indeed
the
unsympathetic
youth
of
the
neighborhood
with
that
keen
sense
for
visible
characteristics
which
ever
distinguishes
the
young
male
of
our
species
sometimes
mentioned
him
among
themselves
by
the
name
of
spoony
glum
it
occurred
one
day
that
john
hardshaw
was
possessed
by
the
spirit
of
unrest
god
knows
what
led
him
whither
he
went
but
he
crossed
market
street
and
held
his
way
northward
over
the
hills
and
downward
into
the
region
known
as
north
beach
turning
aimlessly
to
the
left
he
followed
his
toes
along
an
unfamiliar
street
until
he
was
opposite
what
for
that
period
was
a
rather
grand
dwelling
and
for
this
is
a
rather
shabby
factory
casting
his
eyes
casually
upward
he
saw
at
an
open
window
what
it
had
been
better
that
he
had
not
seen--the
face
and
figure
of
elvira
barwell
their
eyes
met
with
a
sharp
exclamation
like
the
cry
of
a
startled
bird
the
lady
sprang
to
her
feet
and
thrust
her
body
half
out
of
the
window
clutching
the
casing
on
each
side
arrested
by
the
cry
the
people
in
the
street
below
looked
up
hardshaw
stood
motionless
speechless
his
eyes
two
flames
take
care
shouted
some
one
in
the
crowd
as
the
woman
strained
further
and
further
forward
defying
the
silent
implacable
law
of
gravitation
as
once
she
had
defied
that
other
law
which
god
thundered
from
sinai
the
suddenness
of
her
movements
had
tumbled
a
torrent
of
dark
hair
down
her
shoulders
and
now
it
was
blown
about
her
cheeks
almost
concealing
her
face
a
moment
so
and
then--
a
fearful
cry
rang
through
the
street
as
losing
her
balance
she
pitched
headlong
from
the
window
a
confused
and
whirling
mass
of
skirts
limbs
hair
and
white
face
and
struck
the
pavement
with
a
horrible
sound
and
a
force
of
impact
that
was
felt
a
hundred
feet
away
for
a
moment
all
eyes
refused
their
office
and
turned
from
the
sickening
spectacle
on
the
sidewalk
drawn
again
to
that
horror
they
saw
it
strangely
augmented
a
man
hatless
seated
flat
upon
the
paving
stones
held
the
broken
bleeding
body
against
his
breast
kissing
the
mangled
cheeks
and
streaming
mouth
through
tangles
of
wet
hair
his
own
features
indistinguishably
crimson
with
the
blood
that
half-strangled
him
and
ran
in
rills
from
his
soaken
beard
the
reporter's
task
is
nearly
finished
the
barwells
had
that
very
morning
returned
from
a
two
years'
absence
in
peru
a
week
later
the
widower
now
doubly
desolate
since
there
could
be
no
missing
the
significance
of
hardshaw's
horrible
demonstration
had
sailed
for
i
know
not
what
distant
port
he
has
never
come
back
to
stay
hardshaw--as
johnson
no
longer--passed
a
year
in
the
stockton
asylum
for
the
insane
where
also
through
the
influence
of
pitying
friends
his
wife
was
admitted
to
care
for
him
when
he
was
discharged
not
cured
but
harmless
they
returned
to
the
city
it
would
seem
ever
to
have
had
some
dreadful
fascination
for
them
for
a
time
they
lived
near
the
mission
dolores
in
poverty
only
less
abject
than
that
which
is
their
present
lot
but
it
was
too
far
away
from
the
objective
point
of
the
man's
daily
pilgrimage
they
could
not
afford
car
fare
so
that
poor
devil
of
an
angel
from
heaven--wife
to
this
convict
and
lunatic--obtained
at
a
fair
enough
rental
the
blank-faced
shanty
on
the
lower
terrace
of
goat
hill
thence
to
the
structure
that
was
a
dwelling
and
is
a
factory
the
distance
is
not
so
great
it
is
in
fact
an
agreeable
walk
judging
from
the
man's
eager
and
cheerful
look
as
he
takes
it
the
return
journey
appears
to
be
a
trifle
wearisome
an
adventure

school
near
brownville
which
as
every
one
knows
who
has
had
the
good
luck
to
live
there
is
the
capital
of
a
considerable
expanse
of
the
finest
scenery
in
california
the
town
is
somewhat
frequented
in
summer
by
a
class
of
persons
whom
it
is
the
habit
of
the
local
journal
to
call
pleasure
seekers
but
who
by
a
juster
classification
would
be
known
as
the
sick
and
those
in
adversity
brownville
itself
might
rightly
enough
be
described
indeed
as
a
summer
place
of
last
resort
it
is
fairly
well
endowed
with
boarding-houses
at
the
least
pernicious
of
which
i
performed
twice
a
day
lunching
at
the
schoolhouse
the
humble
rite
of
cementing
the
alliance
between
soul
and
body
from
this
hostelry
as
the
local
journal
preferred
to
call
it
when
it
did
not
call
it
a
caravanserai
to
the
schoolhouse
the
distance
by
the
wagon
road
was
about
a
mile
and
a
half
but
there
was
a
trail
very
little
used
which
led
over
an
intervening
range
of
low
heavily
wooded
hills
considerably
shortening
the
distance
by
this
trail
i
was
returning
one
evening
later
than
usual
it
was
the
last
day
of
the
term
and
i
had
been
detained
at
the
schoolhouse
until
almost
dark
preparing
an
account
of
my
stewardship
for
the
trustees--two
of
whom
i
proudly
reflected
would
be
able
to
read
it
and
the
third
an
instance
of
the
dominion
of
mind
over
matter
would
be
overruled
in
his
customary
antagonism
to
the
schoolmaster
of
his
own
creation
i
had
gone
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
the
way
when
finding
an
interest
in
the
antics
of
a
family
of
lizards
which
dwelt
thereabout
and
seemed
full
of
reptilian
joy
for
their
immunity
from
the
ills
incident
to
life
at
the
brownville
house
i
sat
upon
a
fallen
tree
to
observe
them
as
i
leaned
wearily
against
a
branch
of
the
gnarled
old
trunk
the
twilight
deepened
in
the
somber
woods
and
the
faint
new
moon
began
casting
visible
shadows
and
gilding
the
leaves
of
the
trees
with
a
tender
but
ghostly
light
i
heard
the
sound
of
voices--a
woman's
angry
impetuous
rising
against
deep
masculine
tones
rich
and
musical
i
strained
my
eyes
peering
through
the
dusky
shadows
of
the
wood
hoping
to
get
a
view
of
the
intruders
on
my
solitude
but
could
see
no
one
for
some
yards
in
each
direction
i
had
an
uninterrupted
view
of
the
trail
and
knowing
of
no
other
within
a
half
mile
thought
the
persons
heard
must
be
approaching
from
the
wood
at
one
side
there
was
no
sound
but
that
of
the
voices
which
were
now
so
distinct
that
i
could
catch
the
words
that
of
the
man
gave
me
an
impression
of
anger
abundantly
confirmed
by
the
matter
spoken
i
will
have
no
threats
you
are
powerless
as
you
very
well
know
let
things
remain
as
they
are
or
by
god
you
shall
both
suffer
for
it
what
do
you
mean--this
was
the
voice
of
the
woman
a
cultivated
voice
the
voice
of
a
lady
you
would
not--murder
us
there
was
no
reply
at
least
none
that
was
audible
to
me
during
the
silence
i
peered
into
the
wood
in
hope
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
speakers
for
i
felt
sure
that
this
was
an
affair
of
gravity
in
which
ordinary
scruples
ought
not
to
count
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
woman
was
in
peril
at
any
rate
the
man
had
not
disavowed
a
willingness
to
murder
when
a
man
is
enacting
the
rã´le
of
potential
assassin
he
has
not
the
right
to
choose
his
audience
after
some
little
time
i
saw
them
indistinct
in
the
moonlight
among
the
trees
the
man
tall
and
slender
seemed
clothed
in
black
the
woman
wore
as
nearly
as
i
could
make
out
a
gown
of
gray
stuff
evidently
they
were
still
unaware
of
my
presence
in
the
shadow
though
for
some
reason
when
they
renewed
their
conversation
they
spoke
in
lower
tones
and
i
could
no
longer
understand
as
i
looked
the
woman
seemed
to
sink
to
the
ground
and
raise
her
hands
in
supplication
as
is
frequently
done
on
the
stage
and
never
so
far
as
i
knew
anywhere
else
and
i
am
now
not
altogether
sure
that
it
was
done
in
this
instance
the
man
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
they
seemed
to
glitter
bleakly
in
the
moonlight
with
an
expression
that
made
me
apprehensive
that
he
would
turn
them
upon
me
i
do
not
know
by
what
impulse
i
was
moved
but
i
sprang
to
my
feet
out
of
the
shadow
at
that
instant
the
figures
vanished
i
peered
in
vain
through
the
spaces
among
the
trees
and
clumps
of
undergrowth
the
night
wind
rustled
the
leaves
the
lizards
had
retired
early
reptiles
of
exemplary
habits
the
little
moon
was
already
slipping
behind
a
black
hill
in
the
west
i
went
home
somewhat
disturbed
in
mind
half
doubting
that
i
had
heard
or
seen
any
living
thing
excepting
the
lizards
it
all
seemed
a
trifle
odd
and
uncanny
it
was
as
if
among
the
several
phenomena
objective
and
subjective
that
made
the
sum
total
of
the
incident
there
had
been
an
uncertain
element
which
had
diffused
its
dubious
character
over
all--had
leavened
the
whole
mass
with
unreality
i
did
not
like
it
at
the
breakfast
table
the
next
morning
there
was
a
new
face
opposite
me
sat
a
young
woman
at
whom
i
merely
glanced
as
i
took
my
seat
in
speaking
to
the
high
and
mighty
female
personage
who
condescended
to
seem
to
wait
upon
us
this
girl
soon
invited
my
attention
by
the
sound
of
her
voice
which
was
like
yet
not
altogether
like
the
one
still
murmuring
in
my
memory
of
the
previous
evening's
adventure
a
moment
later
another
girl
a
few
years
older
entered
the
room
and
sat
at
the
left
of
the
other
speaking
to
her
a
gentle
good
morning
by
her
voice
i
was
startled
it
was
without
doubt
the
one
of
which
the
first
girl's
had
reminded
me
here
was
the
lady
of
the
sylvan
incident
sitting
bodily
before
me
in
her
habit
as
she
lived
evidently
enough
the
two
were
sisters
with
a
nebulous
kind
of
apprehension
that
i
might
be
recognized
as
the
mute
inglorious
hero
of
an
adventure
which
had
in
my
consciousness
and
conscience
something
of
the
character
of
eavesdropping
i
allowed
myself
only
a
hasty
cup
of
the
lukewarm
coffee
thoughtfully
provided
by
the
prescient
waitress
for
the
emergency
and
left
the
table
as
i
passed
out
of
the
house
into
the
grounds
i
heard
a
rich
strong
male
voice
singing
an
aria
from
rigoletto
i
am
bound
to
say
that
it
was
exquisitely
sung
too
but
there
was
something
in
the
performance
that
displeased
me
i
could
say
neither
what
nor
why
and
i
walked
rapidly
away
returning
later
in
the
day
i
saw
the
elder
of
the
two
young
women
standing
on
the
porch
and
near
her
a
tall
man
in
black
clothing--the
man
whom
i
had
expected
to
see
all
day
the
desire
to
know
something
of
these
persons
had
been
uppermost
in
my
mind
and
i
now
resolved
to
learn
what
i
could
of
them
in
any
way
that
was
neither
dishonorable
nor
low
the
man
was
talking
easily
and
affably
to
his
companion
but
at
the
sound
of
my
footsteps
on
the
gravel
walk
he
ceased
and
turning
about
looked
me
full
in
the
face
he
was
apparently
of
middle
age
dark
and
uncommonly
handsome
his
attire
was
faultless
his
bearing
easy
and
graceful
the
look
which
he
turned
upon
me
open
free
and
devoid
of
any
suggestion
of
rudeness
nevertheless
it
affected
me
with
a
distinct
emotion
which
on
subsequent
analysis
in
memory
appeared
to
be
compounded
of
hatred
and
dread--i
am
unwilling
to
call
it
fear
a
second
later
the
man
and
woman
had
disappeared
they
seemed
to
have
a
trick
of
disappearing
on
entering
the
house
however
i
saw
them
through
the
open
doorway
of
the
parlor
as
i
passed
they
had
merely
stepped
through
a
window
which
opened
down
to
the
floor
cautiously
approached
on
the
subject
of
her
new
guests
my
landlady
proved
not
ungracious
restated
with
i
hope
some
small
reverence
for
english
grammar
the
facts
were
these
the
two
girls
were
pauline
and
eva
maynard
of
san
francisco
the
elder
was
pauline
the
man
was
richard
benning
their
guardian
who
had
been
the
most
intimate
friend
of
their
father
now
deceased
mr
benning
had
brought
them
to
brownville
in
the
hope
that
the
mountain
climate
might
benefit
eva
who
was
thought
to
be
in
danger
of
consumption
upon
these
short
and
simple
annals
the
landlady
wrought
an
embroidery
of
eulogium
which
abundantly
attested
her
faith
in
mr
benning's
will
and
ability
to
pay
for
the
best
that
her
house
afforded
that
he
had
a
good
heart
was
evident
to
her
from
his
devotion
to
his
two
beautiful
wards
and
his
really
touching
solicitude
for
their
comfort
the
evidence
impressed
me
as
insufficient
and
i
silently
found
the
scotch
verdict
not
proven
certainly
mr
benning
was
most
attentive
to
his
wards
in
my
strolls
about
the
country
i
frequently
encountered
them--sometimes
in
company
with
other
guests
of
the
hotel--exploring
the
gulches
fishing
rifle
shooting
and
otherwise
wiling
away
the
monotony
of
country
life
and
although
i
watched
them
as
closely
as
good
manners
would
permit
i
saw
nothing
that
would
in
any
way
explain
the
strange
words
that
i
had
overheard
in
the
wood
i
had
grown
tolerably
well
acquainted
with
the
young
ladies
and
could
exchange
looks
and
even
greetings
with
their
guardian
without
actual
repugnance
a
month
went
by
and
i
had
almost
ceased
to
interest
myself
in
their
affairs
when
one
night
our
entire
little
community
was
thrown
into
excitement
by
an
event
which
vividly
recalled
my
experience
in
the
forest
this
was
the
death
of
the
elder
girl
pauline
the
sisters
had
occupied
the
same
bedroom
on
the
third
floor
of
the
house
waking
in
the
gray
of
the
morning
eva
had
found
pauline
dead
beside
her
later
when
the
poor
girl
was
weeping
beside
the
body
amid
a
throng
of
sympathetic
if
not
very
considerate
persons
mr
benning
entered
the
room
and
appeared
to
be
about
to
take
her
hand
she
drew
away
from
the
side
of
the
dead
and
moved
slowly
toward
the
door
it
is
you
she
said--you
who
have
done
this
you--you--you
she
is
raving
he
said
in
a
low
voice
he
followed
her
step
by
step
as
she
retreated
his
eyes
fixed
upon
hers
with
a
steady
gaze
in
which
there
was
nothing
of
tenderness
nor
of
compassion
she
stopped
the
hand
that
she
had
raised
in
accusation
fell
to
her
side
her
dilated
eyes
contracted
visibly
the
lids
slowly
dropped
over
them
veiling
their
strange
wild
beauty
and
she
stood
motionless
and
almost
as
white
as
the
dead
girl
lying
near
the
man
took
her
hand
and
put
his
arm
gently
about
her
shoulders
as
if
to
support
her
suddenly
she
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
and
clung
to
him
as
a
child
to
its
mother
he
smiled
with
a
smile
that
affected
me
most
disagreeably--perhaps
any
kind
of
smile
would
have
done
so--and
led
her
silently
out
of
the
room
there
was
an
inquest--and
the
customary
verdict
the
deceased
it
appeared
came
to
her
death
through
heart
disease
it
was
before
the
invention
of
heart
failure
though
the
heart
of
poor
pauline
had
indubitably
failed
the
body
was
embalmed
and
taken
to
san
francisco
by
some
one
summoned
thence
for
the
purpose
neither
eva
nor
benning
accompanying
it
some
of
the
hotel
gossips
ventured
to
think
that
very
strange
and
a
few
hardy
spirits
went
so
far
as
to
think
it
very
strange
indeed
but
the
good
landlady
generously
threw
herself
into
the
breach
saying
it
was
owing
to
the
precarious
nature
of
the
girl's
health
it
is
not
of
record
that
either
of
the
two
persons
most
affected
and
apparently
least
concerned
made
any
explanation
one
evening
about
a
week
after
the
death
i
went
out
upon
the
veranda
of
the
hotel
to
get
a
book
that
i
had
left
there
under
some
vines
shutting
out
the
moonlight
from
a
part
of
the
space
i
saw
richard
benning
for
whose
apparition
i
was
prepared
by
having
previously
heard
the
low
sweet
voice
of
eva
maynard
whom
also
i
now
discerned
standing
before
him
with
one
hand
raised
to
his
shoulder
and
her
eyes
as
nearly
as
i
could
judge
gazing
upward
into
his
he
held
her
disengaged
hand
and
his
head
was
bent
with
a
singular
dignity
and
grace
their
attitude
was
that
of
lovers
and
as
i
stood
in
deep
shadow
to
observe
i
felt
even
guiltier
than
on
that
memorable
night
in
the
wood
i
was
about
to
retire
when
the
girl
spoke
and
the
contrast
between
her
words
and
her
attitude
was
so
surprising
that
i
remained
because
i
had
merely
forgotten
to
go
away
you
will
take
my
life
she
said
as
you
did
pauline's
i
know
your
intention
as
well
as
i
know
your
power
and
i
ask
nothing
only
that
you
finish
your
work
without
needless
delay
and
let
me
be
at
peace
he
made
no
reply--merely
let
go
the
hand
that
he
was
holding
removed
the
other
from
his
shoulder
and
turning
away
descended
the
steps
leading
to
the
garden
and
disappeared
in
the
shrubbery
but
a
moment
later
i
heard
seemingly
from
a
great
distance
his
fine
clear
voice
in
a
barbaric
chant
which
as
i
listened
brought
before
some
inner
spiritual
sense
a
consciousness
of
some
far
strange
land
peopled
with
beings
having
forbidden
powers
the
song
held
me
in
a
kind
of
spell
but
when
it
had
died
away
i
recovered
and
instantly
perceived
what
i
thought
an
opportunity
i
walked
out
of
my
shadow
to
where
the
girl
stood
she
turned
and
stared
at
me
with
something
of
the
look
it
seemed
to
me
of
a
hunted
hare
possibly
my
intrusion
had
frightened
her
miss
maynard
i
said
i
beg
you
to
tell
me
who
that
man
is
and
the
nature
of
his
power
over
you
perhaps
this
is
rude
in
me
but
it
is
not
a
matter
for
idle
civilities
when
a
woman
is
in
danger
any
man
has
a
right
to
act
she
listened
without
visible
emotion--almost
i
thought
without
interest
and
when
i
had
finished
she
closed
her
big
blue
eyes
as
if
unspeakably
weary
you
can
do
nothing
she
said
i
took
hold
of
her
arm
gently
shaking
her
as
one
shakes
a
person
falling
into
a
dangerous
sleep
you
must
rouse
yourself
i
said
something
must
be
done
and
you
must
give
me
leave
to
act
you
have
said
that
that
man
killed
your
sister
and
i
believe
it--that
he
will
kill
you
and
i
believe
that
she
merely
raised
her
eyes
to
mine
will
you
not
tell
me
all
i
added
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
i
tell
you--nothing
and
if
i
could
do
anything
i
would
not
it
does
not
matter
in
the
least
we
shall
be
here
only
two
days
more
we
go
away
then
oh
so
far
if
you
have
observed
anything
i
beg
you
to
be
silent
but
this
is
madness
girl
i
was
trying
by
rough
speech
to
break
the
deadly
repose
of
her
manner
you
have
accused
him
of
murder
unless
you
explain
these
things
to
me
i
shall
lay
the
matter
before
the
authorities
this
roused
her
but
in
a
way
that
i
did
not
like
she
lifted
her
head
proudly
and
said
do
not
meddle
sir
in
what
does
not
concern
you
this
is
my
affair
mr
moran
not
yours
it
concerns
every
person
in
the
country--in
the
world
i
answered
with
equal
coldness
if
you
had
no
love
for
your
sister
i
at
least
am
concerned
for
you
listen
she
interrupted
leaning
toward
me
i
loved
her
yes
god
knows
but
more
than
that--beyond
all
beyond
expression
i
love
him
you
have
overheard
a
secret
but
you
shall
not
make
use
of
it
to
harm
him
i
shall
deny
all
your
word
against
mine--it
will
be
that
do
you
think
your
'authorities'
will
believe
you
she
was
now
smiling
like
an
angel
and
god
help
me
i
was
heels
over
head
in
love
with
her
did
she
by
some
of
the
many
methods
of
divination
known
to
her
sex
read
my
feelings
her
whole
manner
had
altered
come
she
said
almost
coaxingly
promise
that
you
will
not
be
impolite
again
she
took
my
arm
in
the
most
friendly
way
come
i
will
walk
with
you
he
will
not
know--he
will
remain
away
all
night
up
and
down
the
veranda
we
paced
in
the
moonlight
she
seemingly
forgetting
her
recent
bereavement
cooing
and
murmuring
girl-wise
of
every
kind
of
nothing
in
all
brownville
i
silent
consciously
awkward
and
with
something
of
the
feeling
of
being
concerned
in
an
intrigue
it
was
a
revelation--this
most
charming
and
apparently
blameless
creature
coolly
and
confessedly
deceiving
the
man
for
whom
a
moment
before
she
had
acknowledged
and
shown
the
supreme
love
which
finds
even
death
an
acceptable
endearment
truly
i
thought
in
my
inexperience
here
is
something
new
under
the
moon
and
the
moon
must
have
smiled
before
we
parted
i
had
exacted
a
promise
that
she
would
walk
with
me
the
next
afternoon--before
going
away
forever--to
the
old
mill
one
of
brownville's
revered
antiquities
erected
in
1860
if
he
is
not
about
she
added
gravely
as
i
let
go
the
hand
she
had
given
me
at
parting
and
of
which
may
the
good
saints
forgive
me
i
strove
vainly
to
repossess
myself
when
she
had
said
it--so
charming
as
the
wise
frenchman
has
pointed
out
do
we
find
woman's
infidelity
when
we
are
its
objects
not
its
victims
in
apportioning
his
benefactions
that
night
the
angel
of
sleep
overlooked
me
the
brownville
house
dined
early
and
after
dinner
the
next
day
miss
maynard
who
had
not
been
at
table
came
to
me
on
the
veranda
attired
in
the
demurest
of
walking
costumes
saying
not
a
word
he
was
evidently
not
about
we
went
slowly
up
the
road
that
led
to
the
old
mill
she
was
apparently
not
strong
and
at
times
took
my
arm
relinquishing
it
and
taking
it
again
rather
capriciously
i
thought
her
mood
or
rather
her
succession
of
moods
was
as
mutable
as
skylight
in
a
rippling
sea
she
jested
as
if
she
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
death
and
laughed
on
the
lightest
incitement
and
directly
afterward
would
sing
a
few
bars
of
some
grave
melody
with
such
tenderness
of
expression
that
i
had
to
turn
away
my
eyes
lest
she
should
see
the
evidence
of
her
success
in
art
if
art
it
was
not
artlessness
as
then
i
was
compelled
to
think
it
and
she
said
the
oddest
things
in
the
most
unconventional
way
skirting
sometimes
unfathomable
abysms
of
thought
where
i
had
hardly
the
courage
to
set
foot
in
short
she
was
fascinating
in
a
thousand
and
fifty
different
ways
and
at
every
step
i
executed
a
new
and
profounder
emotional
folly
a
hardier
spiritual
indiscretion
incurring
fresh
liability
to
arrest
by
the
constabulary
of
conscience
for
infractions
of
my
own
peace
arriving
at
the
mill
she
made
no
pretense
of
stopping
but
turned
into
a
trail
leading
through
a
field
of
stubble
toward
a
creek
crossing
by
a
rustic
bridge
we
continued
on
the
trail
which
now
led
uphill
to
one
of
the
most
picturesque
spots
in
the
country
the
eagle's
nest
it
was
called--the
summit
of
a
cliff
that
rose
sheer
into
the
air
to
a
height
of
hundreds
of
feet
above
the
forest
at
its
base
from
this
elevated
point
we
had
a
noble
view
of
another
valley
and
of
the
opposite
hills
flushed
with
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
as
we
watched
the
light
escaping
to
higher
and
higher
planes
from
the
encroaching
flood
of
shadow
filling
the
valley
we
heard
footsteps
and
in
another
moment
were
joined
by
richard
benning
i
saw
you
from
the
road
he
said
carelessly
so
i
came
up
being
a
fool
i
neglected
to
take
him
by
the
throat
and
pitch
him
into
the
treetops
below
but
muttered
some
polite
lie
instead
on
the
girl
the
effect
of
his
coming
was
immediate
and
unmistakable
her
face
was
suffused
with
the
glory
of
love's
transfiguration
the
red
light
of
the
sunset
had
not
been
more
obvious
in
her
eyes
than
was
now
the
lovelight
that
replaced
it
i
am
so
glad
you
came
she
said
giving
him
both
her
hands
and
god
help
me
it
was
manifestly
true
seating
himself
upon
the
ground
he
began
a
lively
dissertation
upon
the
wild
flowers
of
the
region
a
number
of
which
he
had
with
him
in
the
middle
of
a
facetious
sentence
he
suddenly
ceased
speaking
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
eva
who
leaned
against
the
stump
of
a
tree
absently
plaiting
grasses
she
lifted
her
eyes
in
a
startled
way
to
his
as
if
she
had
felt
his
look
she
then
rose
cast
away
her
grasses
and
moved
slowly
away
from
him
he
also
rose
continuing
to
look
at
her
he
had
still
in
his
hand
the
bunch
of
flowers
the
girl
turned
as
if
to
speak
but
said
nothing
i
recall
clearly
now
something
of
which
i
was
but
half-conscious
then--the
dreadful
contrast
between
the
smile
upon
her
lips
and
the
terrified
expression
in
her
eyes
as
she
met
his
steady
and
imperative
gaze
i
know
nothing
of
how
it
happened
nor
how
it
was
that
i
did
not
sooner
understand
i
only
know
that
with
the
smile
of
an
angel
upon
her
lips
and
that
look
of
terror
in
her
beautiful
eyes
eva
maynard
sprang
from
the
cliff
and
shot
crashing
into
the
tops
of
the
pines
below
how
and
how
long
afterward
i
reached
the
place
i
cannot
say
but
richard
benning
was
already
there
kneeling
beside
the
dreadful
thing
that
had
been
a
woman
she
is
dead--quite
dead
he
said
coldly
i
will
go
to
town
for
assistance
please
do
me
the
favor
to
remain
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
moved
away
but
in
a
moment
had
stopped
and
turned
about
you
have
doubtless
observed
my
friend
he
said
that
this
was
entirely
her
own
act
i
did
not
rise
in
time
to
prevent
it
and
you
not
knowing
her
mental
condition--you
could
not
of
course
have
suspected
his
manner
maddened
me
you
are
as
much
her
assassin
i
said
as
if
your
damnable
hands
had
cut
her
throat
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
without
reply
and
turning
walked
away
a
moment
later
i
heard
through
the
deepening
shadows
of
the
wood
into
which
he
had
disappeared
a
rich
strong
baritone
voice
singing
la
donna
e
mobile
from
rigoletto
the
famous
gilson
bequest
it
was
rough
on
gilson
such
was
the
terse
cold
but
not
altogether
unsympathetic
judgment
of
the
better
public
opinion
at
mammon
hill--the
dictum
of
respectability
the
verdict
of
the
opposite
or
rather
the
opposing
element--the
element
that
lurked
red-eyed
and
restless
about
moll
gurney's
deadfall
while
respectability
took
it
with
sugar
at
mr
jo
bentley's
gorgeous
saloon--was
to
pretty
much
the
same
general
effect
though
somewhat
more
ornately
expressed
by
the
use
of
picturesque
expletives
which
it
is
needless
to
quote
virtually
mammon
hill
was
a
unit
on
the
gilson
question
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
in
a
merely
temporal
sense
all
was
not
well
with
mr
gilson
he
had
that
morning
been
led
into
town
by
mr
brentshaw
and
publicly
charged
with
horse
stealing
the
sheriff
meantime
busying
himself
about
the
tree
with
a
new
manila
rope
and
carpenter
pete
being
actively
employed
between
drinks
upon
a
pine
box
about
the
length
and
breadth
of
mr
gilson
society
having
rendered
its
verdict
there
remained
between
gilson
and
eternity
only
the
decent
formality
of
a
trial
these
are
the
short
and
simple
annals
of
the
prisoner
he
had
recently
been
a
resident
of
new
jerusalem
on
the
north
fork
of
the
little
stony
but
had
come
to
the
newly
discovered
placers
of
mammon
hill
immediately
before
the
rush
by
which
the
former
place
was
depopulated
the
discovery
of
the
new
diggings
had
occurred
opportunely
for
mr
gilson
for
it
had
only
just
before
been
intimated
to
him
by
a
new
jerusalem
vigilance
committee
that
it
would
better
his
prospects
in
and
for
life
to
go
somewhere
and
the
list
of
places
to
which
he
could
safely
go
did
not
include
any
of
the
older
camps
so
he
naturally
established
himself
at
mammon
hill
being
eventually
followed
thither
by
all
his
judges
he
ordered
his
conduct
with
considerable
circumspection
but
as
he
had
never
been
known
to
do
an
honest
day's
work
at
any
industry
sanctioned
by
the
stern
local
code
of
morality
except
draw
poker
he
was
still
an
object
of
suspicion
indeed
it
was
conjectured
that
he
was
the
author
of
the
many
daring
depredations
that
had
recently
been
committed
with
pan
and
brush
on
the
sluice
boxes
prominent
among
those
in
whom
this
suspicion
had
ripened
into
a
steadfast
conviction
was
mr
brentshaw
at
all
seasonable
and
unseasonable
times
mr
brentshaw
avowed
his
belief
in
mr
gilson's
connection
with
these
unholy
midnight
enterprises
and
his
own
willingness
to
prepare
a
way
for
the
solar
beams
through
the
body
of
any
one
who
might
think
it
expedient
to
utter
a
different
opinion--which
in
his
presence
no
one
was
more
careful
not
to
do
than
the
peace-loving
person
most
concerned
whatever
may
have
been
the
truth
of
the
matter
it
is
certain
that
gilson
frequently
lost
more
clean
dust
at
jo
bentley's
faro
table
than
it
was
recorded
in
local
history
that
he
had
ever
honestly
earned
at
draw
poker
in
all
the
days
of
the
camp's
existence
but
at
last
mr
bentley--fearing
it
may
be
to
lose
the
more
profitable
patronage
of
mr
brentshaw--peremptorily
refused
to
let
gilson
copper
the
queen
intimating
at
the
same
time
in
his
frank
forthright
way
that
the
privilege
of
losing
money
at
this
bank
was
a
blessing
appertaining
to
proceeding
logically
from
and
coterminous
with
a
condition
of
notorious
commercial
righteousness
and
social
good
repute
the
hill
thought
it
high
time
to
look
after
a
person
whom
its
most
honored
citizen
had
felt
it
his
duty
to
rebuke
at
a
considerable
personal
sacrifice
the
new
jerusalem
contingent
particularly
began
to
abate
something
of
the
toleration
begotten
of
amusement
at
their
own
blunder
in
exiling
an
objectionable
neighbor
from
the
place
which
they
had
left
to
the
place
whither
they
had
come
mammon
hill
was
at
last
of
one
mind
not
much
was
said
but
that
gilson
must
hang
was
in
the
air
but
at
this
critical
juncture
in
his
affairs
he
showed
signs
of
an
altered
life
if
not
a
changed
heart
perhaps
it
was
only
that
the
bank
being
closed
against
him
he
had
no
further
use
for
gold
dust
anyhow
the
sluice
boxes
were
molested
no
more
forever
but
it
was
impossible
to
repress
the
abounding
energies
of
such
a
nature
as
his
and
he
continued
possibly
from
habit
the
tortuous
courses
which
he
had
pursued
for
profit
of
mr
bentley
after
a
few
tentative
and
resultless
undertakings
in
the
way
of
highway
robbery--if
one
may
venture
to
designate
road-agency
by
so
harsh
a
name--he
made
one
or
two
modest
essays
in
horse-herding
and
it
was
in
the
midst
of
a
promising
enterprise
of
this
character
and
just
as
he
had
taken
the
tide
in
his
affairs
at
its
flood
that
he
made
shipwreck
for
on
a
misty
moonlight
night
mr
brentshaw
rode
up
alongside
a
person
who
was
evidently
leaving
that
part
of
the
country
laid
a
hand
upon
the
halter
connecting
mr
gilson's
wrist
with
mr
harper's
bay
mare
tapped
him
familiarly
on
the
cheek
with
the
barrel
of
a
navy
revolver
and
requested
the
pleasure
of
his
company
in
a
direction
opposite
to
that
in
which
he
was
traveling
it
was
indeed
rough
on
gilson
on
the
morning
after
his
arrest
he
was
tried
convicted
and
sentenced
it
only
remains
so
far
as
concerns
his
earthly
career
to
hang
him
reserving
for
more
particular
mention
his
last
will
and
testament
which
with
great
labor
he
contrived
in
prison
and
in
which
probably
from
some
confused
and
imperfect
notion
of
the
rights
of
captors
he
bequeathed
everything
he
owned
to
his
lawfle
execketer
mr
brentshaw
the
bequest
however
was
made
conditional
on
the
legatee
taking
the
testator's
body
from
the
tree
and
planting
it
white
so
mr
gilson
was--i
was
about
to
say
swung
off
but
i
fear
there
has
been
already
something
too
much
of
slang
in
this
straightforward
statement
of
facts
besides
the
manner
in
which
the
law
took
its
course
is
more
accurately
described
in
the
terms
employed
by
the
judge
in
passing
sentence
mr
gilson
was
strung
up
in
due
season
mr
brentshaw
somewhat
touched
it
may
well
be
by
the
empty
compliment
of
the
bequest
repaired
to
the
tree
to
pluck
the
fruit
thereof
when
taken
down
the
body
was
found
to
have
in
its
waistcoat
pocket
a
duly
attested
codicil
to
the
will
already
noted
the
nature
of
its
provisions
accounted
for
the
manner
in
which
it
had
been
withheld
for
had
mr
brentshaw
previously
been
made
aware
of
the
conditions
under
which
he
was
to
succeed
to
the
gilson
estate
he
would
indubitably
have
declined
the
responsibility
briefly
stated
the
purport
of
the
codicil
was
as
follows
whereas
at
divers
times
and
in
sundry
places
certain
persons
had
asserted
that
during
his
life
the
testator
had
robbed
their
sluice
boxes
therefore
if
during
the
five
years
next
succeeding
the
date
of
this
instrument
any
one
should
make
proof
of
such
assertion
before
a
court
of
law
such
person
was
to
receive
as
reparation
the
entire
personal
and
real
estate
of
which
the
testator
died
seized
and
possessed
minus
the
expenses
of
court
and
a
stated
compensation
to
the
executor
henry
clay
brentshaw
provided
that
if
more
than
one
person
made
such
proof
the
estate
was
to
be
equally
divided
between
or
among
them
but
in
case
none
should
succeed
in
so
establishing
the
testator's
guilt
then
the
whole
property
minus
court
expenses
as
aforesaid
should
go
to
the
said
henry
clay
brentshaw
for
his
own
use
as
stated
in
the
will
the
syntax
of
this
remarkable
document
was
perhaps
open
to
critical
objection
but
that
was
clearly
enough
the
meaning
of
it
the
orthography
conformed
to
no
recognized
system
but
being
mainly
phonetic
it
was
not
ambiguous
as
the
probate
judge
remarked
it
would
take
five
aces
to
beat
it
mr
brentshaw
smiled
good-humoredly
and
after
performing
the
last
sad
rites
with
amusing
ostentation
had
himself
duly
sworn
as
executor
and
conditional
legatee
under
the
provisions
of
a
law
hastily
passed
at
the
instance
of
the
member
from
the
mammon
hill
district
by
a
facetious
legislature
which
law
was
afterward
discovered
to
have
created
also
three
or
four
lucrative
offices
and
authorized
the
expenditure
of
a
considerable
sum
of
public
money
for
the
construction
of
a
certain
railway
bridge
that
with
greater
advantage
might
perhaps
have
been
erected
on
the
line
of
some
actual
railway
of
course
mr
brentshaw
expected
neither
profit
from
the
will
nor
litigation
in
consequence
of
its
unusual
provisions
gilson
although
frequently
flush
had
been
a
man
whom
assessors
and
tax
collectors
were
well
satisfied
to
lose
no
money
by
but
a
careless
and
merely
formal
search
among
his
papers
revealed
title
deeds
to
valuable
estates
in
the
east
and
certificates
of
deposit
for
incredible
sums
in
banks
less
severely
scrupulous
than
that
of
mr
jo
bentley
the
astounding
news
got
abroad
directly
throwing
the
hill
into
a
fever
of
excitement
the
mammon
hill
patriot
whose
editor
had
been
a
leading
spirit
in
the
proceedings
that
resulted
in
gilson's
departure
from
new
jerusalem
published
a
most
complimentary
obituary
notice
of
the
deceased
and
was
good
enough
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
his
degraded
contemporary
the
squaw
gulch
clarion
was
bringing
virtue
into
contempt
by
beslavering
with
flattery
the
memory
of
one
who
in
life
had
spurned
the
vile
sheet
as
a
nuisance
from
his
door
undeterred
by
the
press
however
claimants
under
the
will
were
not
slow
in
presenting
themselves
with
their
evidence
and
great
as
was
the
gilson
estate
it
appeared
conspicuously
paltry
considering
the
vast
number
of
sluice
boxes
from
which
it
was
averred
to
have
been
obtained
the
country
rose
as
one
man
mr
brentshaw
was
equal
to
the
emergency
with
a
shrewd
application
of
humble
auxiliary
devices
he
at
once
erected
above
the
bones
of
his
benefactor
a
costly
monument
overtopping
every
rough
headboard
in
the
cemetery
and
on
this
he
judiciously
caused
to
be
inscribed
an
epitaph
of
his
own
composing
eulogizing
the
honesty
public
spirit
and
cognate
virtues
of
him
who
slept
beneath
a
victim
to
the
unjust
aspersions
of
slander's
viper
brood
moreover
he
employed
the
best
legal
talent
in
the
territory
to
defend
the
memory
of
his
departed
friend
and
for
five
long
years
the
territorial
courts
were
occupied
with
litigation
growing
out
of
the
gilson
bequest
to
fine
forensic
abilities
mr
brentshaw
opposed
abilities
more
finely
forensic
in
bidding
for
purchasable
favors
he
offered
prices
which
utterly
deranged
the
market
the
judges
found
at
his
hospitable
board
entertainment
for
man
and
beast
the
like
of
which
had
never
been
spread
in
the
territory
with
mendacious
witnesses
he
confronted
witnesses
of
superior
mendacity
nor
was
the
battle
confined
to
the
temple
of
the
blind
goddess--it
invaded
the
press
the
pulpit
the
drawing-room
it
raged
in
the
mart
the
exchange
the
school
in
the
gulches
and
on
the
street
corners
and
upon
the
last
day
of
the
memorable
period
to
which
legal
action
under
the
gilson
will
was
limited
the
sun
went
down
upon
a
region
in
which
the
moral
sense
was
dead
the
social
conscience
callous
the
intellectual
capacity
dwarfed
enfeebled
and
confused
but
mr
brentshaw
was
victorious
all
along
the
line
on
that
night
it
so
happened
that
the
cemetery
in
one
corner
of
which
lay
the
now
honored
ashes
of
the
late
milton
gilson
esq
was
partly
under
water
swollen
by
incessant
rains
cat
creek
had
spilled
over
its
banks
an
angry
flood
which
after
scooping
out
unsightly
hollows
wherever
the
soil
had
been
disturbed
had
partly
subsided
as
if
ashamed
of
the
sacrilege
leaving
exposed
much
that
had
been
piously
concealed
even
the
famous
gilson
monument
the
pride
and
glory
of
mammon
hill
was
no
longer
a
standing
rebuke
to
the
viper
brood
succumbing
to
the
sapping
current
it
had
toppled
prone
to
earth
the
ghoulish
flood
had
exhumed
the
poor
decayed
pine
coffin
which
now
lay
half-exposed
in
pitiful
contrast
to
the
pompous
monolith
which
like
a
giant
note
of
admiration
emphasized
the
disclosure
to
this
depressing
spot
drawn
by
some
subtle
influence
he
had
sought
neither
to
resist
nor
analyze
came
mr
brentshaw
an
altered
man
was
mr
brentshaw
five
years
of
toil
anxiety
and
wakefulness
had
dashed
his
black
locks
with
streaks
and
patches
of
gray
bowed
his
fine
figure
drawn
sharp
and
angular
his
face
and
debased
his
walk
to
a
doddering
shuffle
nor
had
this
lustrum
of
fierce
contention
wrought
less
upon
his
heart
and
intellect
the
careless
good
humor
that
had
prompted
him
to
accept
the
trust
of
the
dead
man
had
given
place
to
a
fixed
habit
of
melancholy
the
firm
vigorous
intellect
had
overripened
into
the
mental
mellowness
of
second
childhood
his
broad
understanding
had
narrowed
to
the
accommodation
of
a
single
idea
and
in
place
of
the
quiet
cynical
incredulity
of
former
days
there
was
in
him
a
haunting
faith
in
the
supernatural
that
flitted
and
fluttered
about
his
soul
shadowy
batlike
ominous
of
insanity
unsettled
in
all
else
his
understanding
clung
to
one
conviction
with
the
tenacity
of
a
wrecked
intellect
that
was
an
unshaken
belief
in
the
entire
blamelessness
of
the
dead
gilson
he
had
so
often
sworn
to
this
in
court
and
asserted
it
in
private
conversation--had
so
frequently
and
so
triumphantly
established
it
by
testimony
that
had
come
expensive
to
him
for
that
very
day
he
had
paid
the
last
dollar
of
the
gilson
estate
to
mr
jo
bentley
the
last
witness
to
the
gilson
good
character--that
it
had
become
to
him
a
sort
of
religious
faith
it
seemed
to
him
the
one
great
central
and
basic
truth
of
life--the
sole
serene
verity
in
a
world
of
lies
on
that
night
as
he
seated
himself
pensively
upon
the
prostrate
monument
trying
by
the
uncertain
moonlight
to
spell
out
the
epitaph
which
five
years
before
he
had
composed
with
a
chuckle
that
memory
had
not
recorded
tears
of
remorse
came
into
his
eyes
as
he
remembered
that
he
had
been
mainly
instrumental
in
compassing
by
a
false
accusation
this
good
man's
death
for
during
some
of
the
legal
proceedings
mr
harper
for
a
consideration
forgotten
had
come
forward
and
sworn
that
in
the
little
transaction
with
his
bay
mare
the
deceased
had
acted
in
strict
accordance
with
the
harperian
wishes
confidentially
communicated
to
the
deceased
and
by
him
faithfully
concealed
at
the
cost
of
his
life
all
that
mr
brentshaw
had
since
done
for
the
dead
man's
memory
seemed
pitifully
inadequate--most
mean
paltry
and
debased
with
selfishness
as
he
sat
there
torturing
himself
with
futile
regrets
a
faint
shadow
fell
across
his
eyes
looking
toward
the
moon
hanging
low
in
the
west
he
saw
what
seemed
a
vague
watery
cloud
obscuring
her
but
as
it
moved
so
that
her
beams
lit
up
one
side
of
it
he
perceived
the
clear
sharp
outline
of
a
human
figure
the
apparition
became
momentarily
more
distinct
and
grew
visibly
it
was
drawing
near
dazed
as
were
his
senses
half
locked
up
with
terror
and
confounded
with
dreadful
imaginings
mr
brentshaw
yet
could
but
perceive
or
think
he
perceived
in
this
unearthly
shape
a
strange
similitude
to
the
mortal
part
of
the
late
milton
gilson
as
that
person
had
looked
when
taken
from
the
tree
five
years
before
the
likeness
was
indeed
complete
even
to
the
full
stony
eyes
and
a
certain
shadowy
circle
about
the
neck
it
was
without
coat
or
hat
precisely
as
gilson
had
been
when
laid
in
his
poor
cheap
casket
by
the
not
ungentle
hands
of
carpenter
pete--for
whom
some
one
had
long
since
performed
the
same
neighborly
office
the
spectre
if
such
it
was
seemed
to
bear
something
in
its
hands
which
mr
brentshaw
could
not
clearly
make
out
it
drew
nearer
and
paused
at
last
beside
the
coffin
containing
the
ashes
of
the
late
mr
gilson
the
lid
of
which
was
awry
half
disclosing
the
uncertain
interior
bending
over
this
the
phantom
seemed
to
shake
into
it
from
a
basin
some
dark
substance
of
dubious
consistency
then
glided
stealthily
back
to
the
lowest
part
of
the
cemetery
here
the
retiring
flood
had
stranded
a
number
of
open
coffins
about
and
among
which
it
gurgled
with
low
sobbings
and
stilly
whispers
stooping
over
one
of
these
the
apparition
carefully
brushed
its
contents
into
the
basin
then
returning
to
its
own
casket
emptied
the
vessel
into
that
as
before
this
mysterious
operation
was
repeated
at
every
exposed
coffin
the
ghost
sometimes
dipping
its
laden
basin
into
the
running
water
and
gently
agitating
it
to
free
it
of
the
baser
clay
always
hoarding
the
residuum
in
its
own
private
box
in
short
the
immortal
part
of
the
late
milton
gilson
was
cleaning
up
the
dust
of
its
neighbors
and
providently
adding
the
same
to
its
own
perhaps
it
was
a
phantasm
of
a
disordered
mind
in
a
fevered
body
perhaps
it
was
a
solemn
farce
enacted
by
pranking
existences
that
throng
the
shadows
lying
along
the
border
of
another
world
god
knows
to
us
is
permitted
only
the
knowledge
that
when
the
sun
of
another
day
touched
with
a
grace
of
gold
the
ruined
cemetery
of
mammon
hill
his
kindliest
beam
fell
upon
the
white
still
face
of
henry
brentshaw
dead
among
the
dead
the
applicant
pushing
his
adventurous
shins
through
the
deep
snow
that
had
fallen
overnight
and
encouraged
by
the
glee
of
his
little
sister
following
in
the
open
way
that
he
made
a
sturdy
small
boy
the
son
of
grayville's
most
distinguished
citizen
struck
his
foot
against
something
of
which
there
was
no
visible
sign
on
the
surface
of
the
snow
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
narrative
to
explain
how
it
came
to
be
there
no
one
who
has
had
the
advantage
of
passing
through
grayville
by
day
can
have
failed
to
observe
the
large
stone
building
crowning
the
low
hill
to
the
north
of
the
railway
station--that
is
to
say
to
the
right
in
going
toward
great
mowbray
it
is
a
somewhat
dull-looking
edifice
of
the
early
comatose
order
and
appears
to
have
been
designed
by
an
architect
who
shrank
from
publicity
and
although
unable
to
conceal
his
work--even
compelled
in
this
instance
to
set
it
on
an
eminence
in
the
sight
of
men--did
what
he
honestly
could
to
insure
it
against
a
second
look
so
far
as
concerns
its
outer
and
visible
aspect
the
abersush
home
for
old
men
is
unquestionably
inhospitable
to
human
attention
but
it
is
a
building
of
great
magnitude
and
cost
its
benevolent
founder
the
profit
of
many
a
cargo
of
the
teas
and
silks
and
spices
that
his
ships
brought
up
from
the
under-world
when
he
was
in
trade
in
boston
though
the
main
expense
was
its
endowment
altogether
this
reckless
person
had
robbed
his
heirs-at-law
of
no
less
a
sum
than
half
a
million
dollars
and
flung
it
away
in
riotous
giving
possibly
it
was
with
a
view
to
get
out
of
sight
of
the
silent
big
witness
to
his
extravagance
that
he
shortly
afterward
disposed
of
all
his
grayville
property
that
remained
to
him
turned
his
back
upon
the
scene
of
his
prodigality
and
went
off
across
the
sea
in
one
of
his
own
ships
but
the
gossips
who
got
their
inspiration
most
directly
from
heaven
declared
that
he
went
in
search
of
a
wife--a
theory
not
easily
reconciled
with
that
of
the
village
humorist
who
solemnly
averred
that
the
bachelor
philanthropist
had
departed
this
life
left
grayville
to
wit
because
the
marriageable
maidens
had
made
it
too
hot
to
hold
him
however
this
may
have
been
he
had
not
returned
and
although
at
long
intervals
there
had
come
to
grayville
in
a
desultory
way
vague
rumors
of
his
wanderings
in
strange
lands
no
one
seemed
certainly
to
know
about
him
and
to
the
new
generation
he
was
no
more
than
a
name
but
from
above
the
portal
of
the
home
for
old
men
the
name
shouted
in
stone
despite
its
unpromising
exterior
the
home
is
a
fairly
commodious
place
of
retreat
from
the
ills
that
its
inmates
have
incurred
by
being
poor
and
old
and
men
at
the
time
embraced
in
this
brief
chronicle
they
were
in
number
about
a
score
but
in
acerbity
querulousness
and
general
ingratitude
they
could
hardly
be
reckoned
at
fewer
than
a
hundred
at
least
that
was
the
estimate
of
the
superintendent
mr
silas
tilbody
it
was
mr
tilbody's
steadfast
conviction
that
always
in
admitting
new
old
men
to
replace
those
who
had
gone
to
another
and
a
better
home
the
trustees
had
distinctly
in
will
the
infraction
of
his
peace
and
the
trial
of
his
patience
in
truth
the
longer
the
institution
was
connected
with
him
the
stronger
was
his
feeling
that
the
founder's
scheme
of
benevolence
was
sadly
impaired
by
providing
any
inmates
at
all
he
had
not
much
imagination
but
with
what
he
had
he
was
addicted
to
the
reconstruction
of
the
home
for
old
men
into
a
kind
of
castle
in
spain
with
himself
as
castellan
hospitably
entertaining
about
a
score
of
sleek
and
prosperous
middle-aged
gentlemen
consummately
good-humored
and
civilly
willing
to
pay
for
their
board
and
lodging
in
this
revised
project
of
philanthropy
the
trustees
to
whom
he
was
indebted
for
his
office
and
responsible
for
his
conduct
had
not
the
happiness
to
appear
as
to
them
it
was
held
by
the
village
humorist
aforementioned
that
in
their
management
of
the
great
charity
providence
had
thoughtfully
supplied
an
incentive
to
thrift
with
the
inference
which
he
expected
to
be
drawn
from
that
view
we
have
nothing
to
do
it
had
neither
support
nor
denial
from
the
inmates
who
certainly
were
most
concerned
they
lived
out
their
little
remnant
of
life
crept
into
graves
neatly
numbered
and
were
succeeded
by
other
old
men
as
like
them
as
could
be
desired
by
the
adversary
of
peace
if
the
home
was
a
place
of
punishment
for
the
sin
of
unthrift
the
veteran
offenders
sought
justice
with
a
persistence
that
attested
the
sincerity
of
their
penitence
it
is
to
one
of
these
that
the
reader's
attention
is
now
invited
in
the
matter
of
attire
this
person
was
not
altogether
engaging
but
for
this
season
which
was
midwinter
a
careless
observer
might
have
looked
upon
him
as
a
clever
device
of
the
husbandman
indisposed
to
share
the
fruits
of
his
toil
with
the
crows
that
toil
not
neither
spin--an
error
that
might
not
have
been
dispelled
without
longer
and
closer
observation
than
he
seemed
to
court
for
his
progress
up
abersush
street
toward
the
home
in
the
gloom
of
the
winter
evening
was
not
visibly
faster
than
what
might
have
been
expected
of
a
scarecrow
blessed
with
youth
health
and
discontent
the
man
was
indisputably
ill-clad
yet
not
without
a
certain
fitness
and
good
taste
withal
for
he
was
obviously
an
applicant
for
admittance
to
the
home
where
poverty
was
a
qualification
in
the
army
of
indigence
the
uniform
is
rags
they
serve
to
distinguish
the
rank
and
file
from
the
recruiting
officers
as
the
old
man
entering
the
gate
of
the
grounds
shuffled
up
the
broad
walk
already
white
with
the
fast-falling
snow
which
from
time
to
time
he
feebly
shook
from
its
various
coigns
of
vantage
on
his
person
he
came
under
inspection
of
the
large
globe
lamp
that
burned
always
by
night
over
the
great
door
of
the
building
as
if
unwilling
to
incur
its
revealing
beams
he
turned
to
the
left
and
passing
a
considerable
distance
along
the
face
of
the
building
rang
at
a
smaller
door
emitting
a
dimmer
ray
that
came
from
within
through
the
fanlight
and
expended
itself
incuriously
overhead
the
door
was
opened
by
no
less
a
personage
than
the
great
mr
tilbody
himself
observing
his
visitor
who
at
once
uncovered
and
somewhat
shortened
the
radius
of
the
permanent
curvature
of
his
back
the
great
man
gave
visible
token
of
neither
surprise
nor
displeasure
mr
tilbody
was
indeed
in
an
uncommonly
good
humor
a
phenomenon
ascribable
doubtless
to
the
cheerful
influence
of
the
season
for
this
was
christmas
eve
and
the
morrow
would
be
that
blessed
365th
part
of
the
year
that
all
christian
souls
set
apart
for
mighty
feats
of
goodness
and
joy
mr
tilbody
was
so
full
of
the
spirit
of
the
season
that
his
fat
face
and
pale
blue
eyes
whose
ineffectual
fire
served
to
distinguish
it
from
an
untimely
summer
squash
effused
so
genial
a
glow
that
it
seemed
a
pity
that
he
could
not
have
lain
down
in
it
basking
in
the
consciousness
of
his
own
identity
he
was
hatted
booted
overcoated
and
umbrellaed
as
became
a
person
who
was
about
to
expose
himself
to
the
night
and
the
storm
on
an
errand
of
charity
for
mr
tilbody
had
just
parted
from
his
wife
and
children
to
go
down
town
and
purchase
the
wherewithal
to
confirm
the
annual
falsehood
about
the
hunch-bellied
saint
who
frequents
the
chimneys
to
reward
little
boys
and
girls
who
are
good
and
especially
truthful
so
he
did
not
invite
the
old
man
in
but
saluted
him
cheerily
hello
just
in
time
a
moment
later
and
you
would
have
missed
me
come
i
have
no
time
to
waste
we'll
walk
a
little
way
together
thank
you
said
the
old
man
upon
whose
thin
and
white
but
not
ignoble
face
the
light
from
the
open
door
showed
an
expression
that
was
perhaps
disappointment
but
if
the
trustees--if
my
application--
the
trustees
mr
tilbody
said
closing
more
doors
than
one
and
cutting
off
two
kinds
of
light
have
agreed
that
your
application
disagrees
with
them
certain
sentiments
are
inappropriate
to
christmastide
but
humor
like
death
has
all
seasons
for
his
own
oh
my
god
cried
the
old
man
in
so
thin
and
husky
a
tone
that
the
invocation
was
anything
but
impressive
and
to
at
least
one
of
his
two
auditors
sounded
indeed
somewhat
ludicrous
to
the
other--but
that
is
a
matter
which
laymen
are
devoid
of
the
light
to
expound
yes
continued
mr
tilbody
accommodating
his
gait
to
that
of
his
companion
who
was
mechanically
and
not
very
successfully
retracing
the
track
that
he
had
made
through
the
snow
they
have
decided
that
under
the
circumstances--under
the
very
peculiar
circumstances
you
understand--it
would
be
inexpedient
to
admit
you
as
superintendent
and
ex
officio
secretary
of
the
honorable
board--as
mr
tilbody
read
his
title
clear
the
magnitude
of
the
big
building
seen
through
its
veil
of
falling
snow
appeared
to
suffer
somewhat
in
comparison--it
is
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
in
the
words
of
deacon
byram
the
chairman
your
presence
in
the
home
would--under
the
circumstances--be
peculiarly
embarrassing
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
submit
to
the
honorable
board
the
statement
that
you
made
to
me
yesterday
of
your
needs
your
physical
condition
and
the
trials
which
it
has
pleased
providence
to
send
upon
you
in
your
very
proper
effort
to
present
your
claims
in
person
but
after
careful
and
i
may
say
prayerful
consideration
of
your
case--with
something
too
i
trust
of
the
large
charitableness
appropriate
to
the
season--it
was
decided
that
we
would
not
be
justified
in
doing
anything
likely
to
impair
the
usefulness
of
the
institution
intrusted
under
providence
to
our
care
they
had
now
passed
out
of
the
grounds
the
street
lamp
opposite
the
gate
was
dimly
visible
through
the
snow
already
the
old
man's
former
track
was
obliterated
and
he
seemed
uncertain
as
to
which
way
he
should
go
mr
tilbody
had
drawn
a
little
away
from
him
but
paused
and
turned
half
toward
him
apparently
reluctant
to
forego
the
continuing
opportunity
under
the
circumstances
he
resumed
the
decision--
but
the
old
man
was
inaccessible
to
the
suasion
of
his
verbosity
he
had
crossed
the
street
into
a
vacant
lot
and
was
going
forward
rather
deviously
toward
nowhere
in
particular--which
he
having
nowhere
in
particular
to
go
to
was
not
so
reasonless
a
proceeding
as
it
looked
and
that
is
how
it
happened
that
the
next
morning
when
the
church
bells
of
all
grayville
were
ringing
with
an
added
unction
appropriate
to
the
day
the
sturdy
little
son
of
deacon
byram
breaking
a
way
through
the
snow
to
the
place
of
worship
struck
his
foot
against
the
body
of
amasa
abersush
philanthropist
a
watcher
by
the
dead
i
in
an
upper
room
of
an
unoccupied
dwelling
in
the
part
of
san
francisco
known
as
north
beach
lay
the
body
of
a
man
under
a
sheet
the
hour
was
near
nine
in
the
evening
the
room
was
dimly
lighted
by
a
single
candle
although
the
weather
was
warm
the
two
windows
contrary
to
the
custom
which
gives
the
dead
plenty
of
air
were
closed
and
the
blinds
drawn
down
the
furniture
of
the
room
consisted
of
but
three
pieces--an
arm-chair
a
small
reading-stand
supporting
the
candle
and
a
long
kitchen
table
supporting
the
body
of
the
man
all
these
as
also
the
corpse
seemed
to
have
been
recently
brought
in
for
an
observer
had
there
been
one
would
have
seen
that
all
were
free
from
dust
whereas
everything
else
in
the
room
was
pretty
thickly
coated
with
it
and
there
were
cobwebs
in
the
angles
of
the
walls
under
the
sheet
the
outlines
of
the
body
could
be
traced
even
the
features
these
having
that
unnaturally
sharp
definition
which
seems
to
belong
to
faces
of
the
dead
but
is
really
characteristic
of
those
only
that
have
been
wasted
by
disease
from
the
silence
of
the
room
one
would
rightly
have
inferred
that
it
was
not
in
the
front
of
the
house
facing
a
street
it
really
faced
nothing
but
a
high
breast
of
rock
the
rear
of
the
building
being
set
into
a
hill
as
a
neighboring
church
clock
was
striking
nine
with
an
indolence
which
seemed
to
imply
such
an
indifference
to
the
flight
of
time
that
one
could
hardly
help
wondering
why
it
took
the
trouble
to
strike
at
all
the
single
door
of
the
room
was
opened
and
a
man
entered
advancing
toward
the
body
as
he
did
so
the
door
closed
apparently
of
its
own
volition
there
was
a
grating
as
of
a
key
turned
with
difficulty
and
the
snap
of
the
lock
bolt
as
it
shot
into
its
socket
a
sound
of
retiring
footsteps
in
the
passage
outside
ensued
and
the
man
was
to
all
appearance
a
prisoner
advancing
to
the
table
he
stood
a
moment
looking
down
at
the
body
then
with
a
slight
shrug
of
the
shoulders
walked
over
to
one
of
the
windows
and
hoisted
the
blind
the
darkness
outside
was
absolute
the
panes
were
covered
with
dust
but
by
wiping
this
away
he
could
see
that
the
window
was
fortified
with
strong
iron
bars
crossing
it
within
a
few
inches
of
the
glass
and
imbedded
in
the
masonry
on
each
side
he
examined
the
other
window
it
was
the
same
he
manifested
no
great
curiosity
in
the
matter
did
not
even
so
much
as
raise
the
sash
if
he
was
a
prisoner
he
was
apparently
a
tractable
one
having
completed
his
examination
of
the
room
he
seated
himself
in
the
arm-chair
took
a
book
from
his
pocket
drew
the
stand
with
its
candle
alongside
and
began
to
read
the
man
was
young--not
more
than
thirty--dark
in
complexion
smooth-shaven
with
brown
hair
his
face
was
thin
and
high-nosed
with
a
broad
forehead
and
a
firmness
of
the
chin
and
jaw
which
is
said
by
those
having
it
to
denote
resolution
the
eyes
were
gray
and
steadfast
not
moving
except
with
definitive
purpose
they
were
now
for
the
greater
part
of
the
time
fixed
upon
his
book
but
he
occasionally
withdrew
them
and
turned
them
to
the
body
on
the
table
not
apparently
from
any
dismal
fascination
which
under
such
circumstances
it
might
be
supposed
to
exercise
upon
even
a
courageous
person
nor
with
a
conscious
rebellion
against
the
contrary
influence
which
might
dominate
a
timid
one
he
looked
at
it
as
if
in
his
reading
he
had
come
upon
something
recalling
him
to
a
sense
of
his
surroundings
clearly
this
watcher
by
the
dead
was
discharging
his
trust
with
intelligence
and
composure
as
became
him
after
reading
for
perhaps
a
half-hour
he
seemed
to
come
to
the
end
of
a
chapter
and
quietly
laid
away
the
book
he
then
rose
and
taking
the
reading-stand
from
the
floor
carried
it
into
a
corner
of
the
room
near
one
of
the
windows
lifted
the
candle
from
it
and
returned
to
the
empty
fireplace
before
which
he
had
been
sitting
a
moment
later
he
walked
over
to
the
body
on
the
table
lifted
the
sheet
and
turned
it
back
from
the
head
exposing
a
mass
of
dark
hair
and
a
thin
face-cloth
beneath
which
the
features
showed
with
even
sharper
definition
than
before
shading
his
eyes
by
interposing
his
free
hand
between
them
and
the
candle
he
stood
looking
at
his
motionless
companion
with
a
serious
and
tranquil
regard
satisfied
with
his
inspection
he
pulled
the
sheet
over
the
face
again
and
returning
to
the
chair
took
some
matches
off
the
candlestick
put
them
in
the
side
pocket
of
his
sack-coat
and
sat
down
he
then
lifted
the
candle
from
its
socket
and
looked
at
it
critically
as
if
calculating
how
long
it
would
last
it
was
barely
two
inches
long
in
another
hour
he
would
be
in
darkness
he
replaced
it
in
the
candlestick
and
blew
it
out
ii
in
a
physician's
office
in
kearny
street
three
men
sat
about
a
table
drinking
punch
and
smoking
it
was
late
in
the
evening
almost
midnight
indeed
and
there
had
been
no
lack
of
punch
the
gravest
of
the
three
dr
helberson
was
the
host--it
was
in
his
rooms
they
sat
he
was
about
thirty
years
of
age
the
others
were
even
younger
all
were
physicians
the
superstitious
awe
with
which
the
living
regard
the
dead
said
dr
helberson
is
hereditary
and
incurable
one
needs
no
more
be
ashamed
of
it
than
of
the
fact
that
he
inherits
for
example
an
incapacity
for
mathematics
or
a
tendency
to
lie
the
others
laughed
oughtn't
a
man
to
be
ashamed
to
lie
asked
the
youngest
of
the
three
who
was
in
fact
a
medical
student
not
yet
graduated
my
dear
harper
i
said
nothing
about
that
the
tendency
to
lie
is
one
thing
lying
is
another
but
do
you
think
said
the
third
man
that
this
superstitious
feeling
this
fear
of
the
dead
reasonless
as
we
know
it
to
be
is
universal
i
am
myself
not
conscious
of
it
oh
but
it
is
'in
your
system'
for
all
that
replied
helberson
it
needs
only
the
right
conditions--what
shakespeare
calls
the
'confederate
season'--to
manifest
itself
in
some
very
disagreeable
way
that
will
open
your
eyes
physicians
and
soldiers
are
of
course
more
nearly
free
from
it
than
others
physicians
and
soldiers--why
don't
you
add
hangmen
and
headsmen
let
us
have
in
all
the
assassin
classes
no
my
dear
mancher
the
juries
will
not
let
the
public
executioners
acquire
sufficient
familiarity
with
death
to
be
altogether
unmoved
by
it
young
harper
who
had
been
helping
himself
to
a
fresh
cigar
at
the
sideboard
resumed
his
seat
what
would
you
consider
conditions
under
which
any
man
of
woman
born
would
become
insupportably
conscious
of
his
share
of
our
common
weakness
in
this
regard
he
asked
rather
verbosely
well
i
should
say
that
if
a
man
were
locked
up
all
night
with
a
corpse--alone--in
a
dark
room--of
a
vacant
house--with
no
bed
covers
to
pull
over
his
head--and
lived
through
it
without
going
altogether
mad
he
might
justly
boast
himself
not
of
woman
born
nor
yet
like
macduff
a
product
of
cã¦sarean
section
i
thought
you
never
would
finish
piling
up
conditions
said
harper
but
i
know
a
man
who
is
neither
a
physician
nor
a
soldier
who
will
accept
them
all
for
any
stake
you
like
to
name
who
is
he
his
name
is
jarette--a
stranger
here
comes
from
my
town
in
new
york
i
have
no
money
to
back
him
but
he
will
back
himself
with
loads
of
it
how
do
you
know
that
he
would
rather
bet
than
eat
as
for
fear--i
dare
say
he
thinks
it
some
cutaneous
disorder
or
possibly
a
particular
kind
of
religious
heresy
what
does
he
look
like
helberson
was
evidently
becoming
interested
like
mancher
here--might
be
his
twin
brother
i
accept
the
challenge
said
helberson
promptly
awfully
obliged
to
you
for
the
compliment
i'm
sure
drawled
mancher
who
was
growing
sleepy
can't
i
get
into
this
not
against
me
helberson
said
i
don't
want
your
money
all
right
said
mancher
i'll
be
the
corpse
the
others
laughed
the
outcome
of
this
crazy
conversation
we
have
seen
iii
in
extinguishing
his
meagre
allowance
of
candle
mr
jarette's
object
was
to
preserve
it
against
some
unforeseen
need
he
may
have
thought
too
or
half
thought
that
the
darkness
would
be
no
worse
at
one
time
than
another
and
if
the
situation
became
insupportable
it
would
be
better
to
have
a
means
of
relief
or
even
release
at
any
rate
it
was
wise
to
have
a
little
reserve
of
light
even
if
only
to
enable
him
to
look
at
his
watch
no
sooner
had
he
blown
out
the
candle
and
set
it
on
the
floor
at
his
side
than
he
settled
himself
comfortably
in
the
arm-chair
leaned
back
and
closed
his
eyes
hoping
and
expecting
to
sleep
in
this
he
was
disappointed
he
had
never
in
his
life
felt
less
sleepy
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
gave
up
the
attempt
but
what
could
he
do
he
could
not
go
groping
about
in
absolute
darkness
at
the
risk
of
bruising
himself--at
the
risk
too
of
blundering
against
the
table
and
rudely
disturbing
the
dead
we
all
recognize
their
right
to
lie
at
rest
with
immunity
from
all
that
is
harsh
and
violent
jarette
almost
succeeded
in
making
himself
believe
that
considerations
of
this
kind
restrained
him
from
risking
the
collision
and
fixed
him
to
the
chair
while
thinking
of
this
matter
he
fancied
that
he
heard
a
faint
sound
in
the
direction
of
the
table--what
kind
of
sound
he
could
hardly
have
explained
he
did
not
turn
his
head
why
should
he--in
the
darkness
but
he
listened--why
should
he
not
and
listening
he
grew
giddy
and
grasped
the
arms
of
the
chair
for
support
there
was
a
strange
ringing
in
his
ears
his
head
seemed
bursting
his
chest
was
oppressed
by
the
constriction
of
his
clothing
he
wondered
why
it
was
so
and
whether
these
were
symptoms
of
fear
then
with
a
long
and
strong
expiration
his
chest
appeared
to
collapse
and
with
the
great
gasp
with
which
he
refilled
his
exhausted
lungs
the
vertigo
left
him
and
he
knew
that
so
intently
had
he
listened
that
he
had
held
his
breath
almost
to
suffocation
the
revelation
was
vexatious
he
arose
pushed
away
the
chair
with
his
foot
and
strode
to
the
centre
of
the
room
but
one
does
not
stride
far
in
darkness
he
began
to
grope
and
finding
the
wall
followed
it
to
an
angle
turned
followed
it
past
the
two
windows
and
there
in
another
corner
came
into
violent
contact
with
the
reading-stand
overturning
it
it
made
a
clatter
that
startled
him
he
was
annoyed
how
the
devil
could
i
have
forgotten
where
it
was
he
muttered
and
groped
his
way
along
the
third
wall
to
the
fireplace
i
must
put
things
to
rights
said
he
feeling
the
floor
for
the
candle
having
recovered
that
he
lighted
it
and
instantly
turned
his
eyes
to
the
table
where
naturally
nothing
had
undergone
any
change
the
reading-stand
lay
unobserved
upon
the
floor
he
had
forgotten
to
put
it
to
rights
he
looked
all
about
the
room
dispersing
the
deeper
shadows
by
movements
of
the
candle
in
his
hand
and
crossing
over
to
the
door
tested
it
by
turning
and
pulling
the
knob
with
all
his
strength
it
did
not
yield
and
this
seemed
to
afford
him
a
certain
satisfaction
indeed
he
secured
it
more
firmly
by
a
bolt
which
he
had
not
before
observed
returning
to
his
chair
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
half-past
nine
with
a
start
of
surprise
he
held
the
watch
at
his
ear
it
had
not
stopped
the
candle
was
now
visibly
shorter
he
again
extinguished
it
placing
it
on
the
floor
at
his
side
as
before
mr
jarette
was
not
at
his
ease
he
was
distinctly
dissatisfied
with
his
surroundings
and
with
himself
for
being
so
what
have
i
to
fear
he
thought
this
is
ridiculous
and
disgraceful
i
will
not
be
so
great
a
fool
but
courage
does
not
come
of
saying
i
will
be
courageous
nor
of
recognizing
its
appropriateness
to
the
occasion
the
more
jarette
condemned
himself
the
more
reason
he
gave
himself
for
condemnation
the
greater
the
number
of
variations
which
he
played
upon
the
simple
theme
of
the
harmlessness
of
the
dead
the
more
insupportable
grew
the
discord
of
his
emotions
what
he
cried
aloud
in
the
anguish
of
his
spirit
what
shall
i
who
have
not
a
shade
of
superstition
in
my
nature--i
who
have
no
belief
in
immortality--i
who
know
and
never
more
clearly
than
now
that
the
after-life
is
the
dream
of
a
desire--shall
i
lose
at
once
my
bet
my
honor
and
my
self-respect
perhaps
my
reason
because
certain
savage
ancestors
dwelling
in
caves
and
burrows
conceived
the
monstrous
notion
that
the
dead
walk
by
night--that--
distinctly
unmistakably
mr
jarette
heard
behind
him
a
light
soft
sound
of
footfalls
deliberate
regular
successively
nearer
iv
just
before
daybreak
the
next
morning
dr
helberson
and
his
young
friend
harper
were
driving
slowly
through
the
streets
of
north
beach
in
the
doctor's
coupã©
have
you
still
the
confidence
of
youth
in
the
courage
or
stolidity
of
your
friend
said
the
elder
man
do
you
believe
that
i
have
lost
this
wager
i
know
you
have
replied
the
other
with
enfeebling
emphasis
well
upon
my
soul
i
hope
so
it
was
spoken
earnestly
almost
solemnly
there
was
a
silence
for
a
few
moments
harper
the
doctor
resumed
looking
very
serious
in
the
shifting
half-lights
that
entered
the
carriage
as
they
passed
the
street
lamps
i
don't
feel
altogether
comfortable
about
this
business
if
your
friend
had
not
irritated
me
by
the
contemptuous
manner
in
which
he
treated
my
doubt
of
his
endurance--a
purely
physical
quality--and
by
the
cool
incivility
of
his
suggestion
that
the
corpse
be
that
of
a
physician
i
should
not
have
gone
on
with
it
if
anything
should
happen
we
are
ruined
as
i
fear
we
deserve
to
be
what
can
happen
even
if
the
matter
should
be
taking
a
serious
turn
of
which
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
mancher
has
only
to
'resurrect'
himself
and
explain
matters
with
a
genuine
'subject'
from
the
dissecting-room
or
one
of
your
late
patients
it
might
be
different
dr
mancher
then
had
been
as
good
as
his
promise
he
was
the
corpse
dr
helberson
was
silent
for
a
long
time
as
the
carriage
at
a
snail's
pace
crept
along
the
same
street
it
had
traveled
two
or
three
times
already
presently
he
spoke
well
let
us
hope
that
mancher
if
he
has
had
to
rise
from
the
dead
has
been
discreet
about
it
a
mistake
in
that
might
make
matters
worse
instead
of
better
yes
said
harper
jarette
would
kill
him
but
doctor--looking
at
his
watch
as
the
carriage
passed
a
gas
lamp--it
is
nearly
four
o'clock
at
last
a
moment
later
the
two
had
quitted
the
vehicle
and
were
walking
briskly
toward
the
long-unoccupied
house
belonging
to
the
doctor
in
which
they
had
immured
mr
jarette
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
mad
wager
as
they
neared
it
they
met
a
man
running
can
you
tell
me
he
cried
suddenly
checking
his
speed
where
i
can
find
a
doctor
what's
the
matter
helberson
asked
non-committal
go
and
see
for
yourself
said
the
man
resuming
his
running
they
hastened
on
arrived
at
the
house
they
saw
several
persons
entering
in
haste
and
excitement
in
some
of
the
dwellings
near
by
and
across
the
way
the
chamber
windows
were
thrown
up
showing
a
protrusion
of
heads
all
heads
were
asking
questions
none
heeding
the
questions
of
the
others
a
few
of
the
windows
with
closed
blinds
were
illuminated
the
inmates
of
those
rooms
were
dressing
to
come
down
exactly
opposite
the
door
of
the
house
that
they
sought
a
street
lamp
threw
a
yellow
insufficient
light
upon
the
scene
seeming
to
say
that
it
could
disclose
a
good
deal
more
if
it
wished
harper
paused
at
the
door
and
laid
a
hand
upon
his
companion's
arm
it
is
all
up
with
us
doctor
he
said
in
extreme
agitation
which
contrasted
strangely
with
his
free-and-easy
words
the
game
has
gone
against
us
all
let's
not
go
in
there
i'm
for
lying
low
i'm
a
physician
said
dr
helberson
calmly
there
may
be
need
of
one
they
mounted
the
doorsteps
and
were
about
to
enter
the
door
was
open
the
street
lamp
opposite
lighted
the
passage
into
which
it
opened
it
was
full
of
men
some
had
ascended
the
stairs
at
the
farther
end
and
denied
admittance
above
waited
for
better
fortune
all
were
talking
none
listening
suddenly
on
the
upper
landing
there
was
a
great
commotion
a
man
had
sprung
out
of
a
door
and
was
breaking
away
from
those
endeavoring
to
detain
him
down
through
the
mass
of
affrighted
idlers
he
came
pushing
them
aside
flattening
them
against
the
wall
on
one
side
or
compelling
them
to
cling
to
the
rail
on
the
other
clutching
them
by
the
throat
striking
them
savagely
thrusting
them
back
down
the
stairs
and
walking
over
the
fallen
his
clothing
was
in
disorder
he
was
without
a
hat
his
eyes
wild
and
restless
had
in
them
something
more
terrifying
than
his
apparently
superhuman
strength
his
face
smooth-shaven
was
bloodless
his
hair
frost-white
as
the
crowd
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
having
more
freedom
fell
away
to
let
him
pass
harper
sprang
forward
jarette
jarette
he
cried
dr
helberson
seized
harper
by
the
collar
and
dragged
him
back
the
man
looked
into
their
faces
without
seeming
to
see
them
and
sprang
through
the
door
down
the
steps
into
the
street
and
away
a
stout
policeman
who
had
had
inferior
success
in
conquering
his
way
down
the
stairway
followed
a
moment
later
and
started
in
pursuit
all
the
heads
in
the
windows--those
of
women
and
children
now--screaming
in
guidance
the
stairway
being
now
partly
cleared
most
of
the
crowd
having
rushed
down
to
the
street
to
observe
the
flight
and
pursuit
dr
helberson
mounted
to
the
landing
followed
by
harper
at
a
door
in
the
upper
passage
an
officer
denied
them
admittance
we
are
physicians
said
the
doctor
and
they
passed
in
the
room
was
full
of
men
dimly
seen
crowded
about
a
table
the
newcomers
edged
their
way
forward
and
looked
over
the
shoulders
of
those
in
the
front
rank
upon
the
table
the
lower
limbs
covered
with
a
sheet
lay
the
body
of
a
man
brilliantly
illuminated
by
the
beam
of
a
bull's-eye
lantern
held
by
a
policeman
standing
at
the
feet
the
others
excepting
those
near
the
head--the
officer
himself--all
were
in
darkness
the
face
of
the
body
showed
yellow
repulsive
horrible
the
eyes
were
partly
open
and
upturned
and
the
jaw
fallen
traces
of
froth
defiled
the
lips
the
chin
the
cheeks
a
tall
man
evidently
a
doctor
bent
over
the
body
with
his
hand
thrust
under
the
shirt
front
he
withdrew
it
and
placed
two
fingers
in
the
open
mouth
this
man
has
been
about
six
hours
dead
said
he
it
is
a
case
for
the
coroner
he
drew
a
card
from
his
pocket
handed
it
to
the
officer
and
made
his
way
toward
the
door
clear
the
room--out
all
said
the
officer
sharply
and
the
body
disappeared
as
if
it
had
been
snatched
away
as
shifting
the
lantern
he
flashed
its
beam
of
light
here
and
there
against
the
faces
of
the
crowd
the
effect
was
amazing
the
men
blinded
confused
almost
terrified
made
a
tumultuous
rush
for
the
door
pushing
crowding
and
tumbling
over
one
another
as
they
fled
like
the
hosts
of
night
before
the
shafts
of
apollo
upon
the
struggling
trampling
mass
the
officer
poured
his
light
without
pity
and
without
cessation
caught
in
the
current
helberson
and
harper
were
swept
out
of
the
room
and
cascaded
down
the
stairs
into
the
street
good
god
doctor
did
i
not
tell
you
that
jarette
would
kill
him
said
harper
as
soon
as
they
were
clear
of
the
crowd
i
believe
you
did
replied
the
other
without
apparent
emotion
they
walked
on
in
silence
block
after
block
against
the
graying
east
the
dwellings
of
the
hill
tribes
showed
in
silhouette
the
familiar
milk
wagon
was
already
astir
in
the
streets
the
baker's
man
would
soon
come
upon
the
scene
the
newspaper
carrier
was
abroad
in
the
land
it
strikes
me
youngster
said
helberson
that
you
and
i
have
been
having
too
much
of
the
morning
air
lately
it
is
unwholesome
we
need
a
change
what
do
you
say
to
a
tour
in
europe
when
i'm
not
particular
i
should
suppose
that
four
o'clock
this
afternoon
would
be
early
enough
i'll
meet
you
at
the
boat
said
harper
seven
years
afterward
these
two
men
sat
upon
a
bench
in
madison
square
new
york
in
familiar
conversation
another
man
who
had
been
observing
them
for
some
time
himself
unobserved
approached
and
courteously
lifting
his
hat
from
locks
as
white
as
frost
said
i
beg
your
pardon
gentlemen
but
when
you
have
killed
a
man
by
coming
to
life
it
is
best
to
change
clothes
with
him
and
at
the
first
opportunity
make
a
break
for
liberty
helberson
and
harper
exchanged
significant
glances
they
were
obviously
amused
the
former
then
looked
the
stranger
kindly
in
the
eye
and
replied
that
has
always
been
my
plan
i
entirely
agree
with
you
as
to
its
advant--
he
stopped
suddenly
rose
and
went
white
he
stared
at
the
man
open-mouthed
he
trembled
visibly
ah
said
the
stranger
i
see
that
you
are
indisposed
doctor
if
you
cannot
treat
yourself
dr
harper
can
do
something
for
you
i
am
sure
who
the
devil
are
you
said
harper
bluntly
the
stranger
came
nearer
and
bending
toward
them
said
in
a
whisper
i
call
myself
jarette
sometimes
but
i
don't
mind
telling
you
for
old
friendship
that
i
am
dr
william
mancher
the
revelation
brought
harper
to
his
feet
mancher
he
cried
and
helberson
added
it
is
true
by
god
yes
said
the
stranger
smiling
vaguely
it
is
true
enough
no
doubt
he
hesitated
and
seemed
to
be
trying
to
recall
something
then
began
humming
a
popular
air
he
had
apparently
forgotten
their
presence
look
here
mancher
said
the
elder
of
the
two
tell
us
just
what
occurred
that
night--to
jarette
you
know
oh
yes
about
jarette
said
the
other
it's
odd
i
should
have
neglected
to
tell
you--i
tell
it
so
often
you
see
i
knew
by
over-hearing
him
talking
to
himself
that
he
was
pretty
badly
frightened
so
i
couldn't
resist
the
temptation
to
come
to
life
and
have
a
bit
of
fun
out
of
him--i
couldn't
really
that
was
all
right
though
certainly
i
did
not
think
he
would
take
it
so
seriously
i
did
not
truly
and
afterward--well
it
was
a
tough
job
changing
places
with
him
and
then--damn
you
you
didn't
let
me
out
nothing
could
exceed
the
ferocity
with
which
these
last
words
were
delivered
both
men
stepped
back
in
alarm
we--why--why
helberson
stammered
losing
his
self-possession
utterly
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
didn't
i
say
you
were
drs
hell-born
and
sharper
inquired
the
man
laughing
my
name
is
helberson
yes
and
this
gentleman
is
mr
harper
replied
the
former
reassured
by
the
laugh
but
we
are
not
physicians
now
we
are--well
hang
it
old
man
we
are
gamblers
and
that
was
the
truth
a
very
good
profession--very
good
indeed
and
by
the
way
i
hope
sharper
here
paid
over
jarette's
money
like
an
honest
stakeholder
a
very
good
and
honorable
profession
he
repeated
thoughtfully
moving
carelessly
away
but
i
stick
to
the
old
one
i
am
high
supreme
medical
officer
of
the
bloomingdale
asylum
it
is
my
duty
to
cure
the
superintendent
the
man
and
the

it

hys

stretched
at
ease
upon
a
sofa
in
gown
and
slippers
harker
brayton
smiled
as
he
read
the
foregoing
sentence
in
old
morryster's
marvells
of
science
the
only
marvel
in
the
matter
he
said
to
himself
is
that
the
wise
and
learned
in
morryster's
day
should
have
believed
such
nonsense
as
is
rejected
by
most
of
even
the
ignorant
in
ours
a
train
of
reflection
followed--for
brayton
was
a
man
of
thought--and
he
unconsciously
lowered
his
book
without
altering
the
direction
of
his
eyes
as
soon
as
the
volume
had
gone
below
the
line
of
sight
something
in
an
obscure
corner
of
the
room
recalled
his
attention
to
his
surroundings
what
he
saw
in
the
shadow
under
his
bed
was
two
small
points
of
light
apparently
about
an
inch
apart
they
might
have
been
reflections
of
the
gas
jet
above
him
in
metal
nail
heads
he
gave
them
but
little
thought
and
resumed
his
reading
a
moment
later
something--
some
impulse
which
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
analyze--impelled
him
to
lower
the
book
again
and
seek
for
what
he
saw
before
the
points
of
light
were
still
there
they
seemed
to
have
become
brighter
than
before
shining
with
a
greenish
lustre
that
he
had
not
at
first
observed
he
thought
too
that
they
might
have
moved
a
trifle--were
somewhat
nearer
they
were
still
too
much
in
shadow
however
to
reveal
their
nature
and
origin
to
an
indolent
attention
and
again
he
resumed
his
reading
suddenly
something
in
the
text
suggested
a
thought
that
made
him
start
and
drop
the
book
for
the
third
time
to
the
side
of
the
sofa
whence
escaping
from
his
hand
it
fell
sprawling
to
the
floor
back
upward
brayton
half-risen
was
staring
intently
into
the
obscurity
beneath
the
bed
where
the
points
of
light
shone
with
it
seemed
to
him
an
added
fire
his
attention
was
now
fully
aroused
his
gaze
eager
and
imperative
it
disclosed
almost
directly
under
the
foot-rail
of
the
bed
the
coils
of
a
large
serpent--the
points
of
light
were
its
eyes
its
horrible
head
thrust
flatly
forth
from
the
innermost
coil
and
resting
upon
the
outermost
was
directed
straight
toward
him
the
definition
of
the
wide
brutal
jaw
and
the
idiot-like
forehead
serving
to
show
the
direction
of
its
malevolent
gaze
the
eyes
were
no
longer
merely
luminous
points
they
looked
into
his
own
with
a
meaning
a
malign
significance
ii
a
snake
in
a
bedroom
of
a
modern
city
dwelling
of
the
better
sort
is
happily
not
so
common
a
phenomenon
as
to
make
explanation
altogether
needless
harker
brayton
a
bachelor
of
thirty-five
a
scholar
idler
and
something
of
an
athlete
rich
popular
and
of
sound
health
had
returned
to
san
francisco
from
all
manner
of
remote
and
unfamiliar
countries
his
tastes
always
a
trifle
luxurious
had
taken
on
an
added
exuberance
from
long
privation
and
the
resources
of
even
the
castle
hotel
being
inadequate
to
their
perfect
gratification
he
had
gladly
accepted
the
hospitality
of
his
friend
dr
druring
the
distinguished
scientist
dr
druring's
house
a
large
old-fashioned
one
in
what
is
now
an
obscure
quarter
of
the
city
had
an
outer
and
visible
aspect
of
proud
reserve
it
plainly
would
not
associate
with
the
contiguous
elements
of
its
altered
environment
and
appeared
to
have
developed
some
of
the
eccentricities
which
come
of
isolation
one
of
these
was
a
wing
conspicuously
irrelevant
in
point
of
architecture
and
no
less
rebellious
in
matter
of
purpose
for
it
was
a
combination
of
laboratory
menagerie
and
museum
it
was
here
that
the
doctor
indulged
the
scientific
side
of
his
nature
in
the
study
of
such
forms
of
animal
life
as
engaged
his
interest
and
comforted
his
taste--which
it
must
be
confessed
ran
rather
to
the
lower
types
for
one
of
the
higher
nimbly
and
sweetly
to
recommend
itself
unto
his
gentle
senses
it
had
at
least
to
retain
certain
rudimentary
characteristics
allying
it
to
such
dragons
of
the
prime
as
toads
and
snakes
his
scientific
sympathies
were
distinctly
reptilian
he
loved
nature's
vulgarians
and
described
himself
as
the
zola
of
zoã¶logy
his
wife
and
daughters
not
having
the
advantage
to
share
his
enlightened
curiosity
regarding
the
works
and
ways
of
our
ill-starred
fellow-creatures
were
with
needless
austerity
excluded
from
what
he
called
the
snakery
and
doomed
to
companionship
with
their
own
kind
though
to
soften
the
rigors
of
their
lot
he
had
permitted
them
out
of
his
great
wealth
to
outdo
the
reptiles
in
the
gorgeousness
of
their
surroundings
and
to
shine
with
a
superior
splendor
architecturally
and
in
point
of
furnishing
the
snakery
had
a
severe
simplicity
befitting
the
humble
circumstances
of
its
occupants
many
of
whom
indeed
could
not
safely
have
been
intrusted
with
the
liberty
that
is
necessary
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
luxury
for
they
had
the
troublesome
peculiarity
of
being
alive
in
their
own
apartments
however
they
were
under
as
little
personal
restraint
as
was
compatible
with
their
protection
from
the
baneful
habit
of
swallowing
one
another
and
as
brayton
had
thoughtfully
been
apprised
it
was
more
than
a
tradition
that
some
of
them
had
at
divers
times
been
found
in
parts
of
the
premises
where
it
would
have
embarrassed
them
to
explain
their
presence
despite
the
snakery
and
its
uncanny
associations--to
which
indeed
he
gave
little
attention--brayton
found
life
at
the
druring
mansion
very
much
to
his
mind
iii
beyond
a
smart
shock
of
surprise
and
a
shudder
of
mere
loathing
mr
brayton
was
not
greatly
affected
his
first
thought
was
to
ring
the
call
bell
and
bring
a
servant
but
although
the
bell
cord
dangled
within
easy
reach
he
made
no
movement
toward
it
it
had
occurred
to
his
mind
that
the
act
might
subject
him
to
the
suspicion
of
fear
which
he
certainly
did
not
feel
he
was
more
keenly
conscious
of
the
incongruous
nature
of
the
situation
than
affected
by
its
perils
it
was
revolting
but
absurd
the
reptile
was
of
a
species
with
which
brayton
was
unfamiliar
its
length
he
could
only
conjecture
the
body
at
the
largest
visible
part
seemed
about
as
thick
as
his
forearm
in
what
way
was
it
dangerous
if
in
any
way
was
it
venomous
was
it
a
constrictor
his
knowledge
of
nature's
danger
signals
did
not
enable
him
to
say
he
had
never
deciphered
the
code
if
not
dangerous
the
creature
was
at
least
offensive
it
was
de
trop--
matter
out
of
place--an
impertinence
the
gem
was
unworthy
of
the
setting
even
the
barbarous
taste
of
our
time
and
country
which
had
loaded
the
walls
of
the
room
with
pictures
the
floor
with
furniture
and
the
furniture
with
bric-a-brac
had
not
quite
fitted
the
place
for
this
bit
of
the
savage
life
of
the
jungle
besides--insupportable
thought--
the
exhalations
of
its
breath
mingled
with
the
atmosphere
which
he
himself
was
breathing
these
thoughts
shaped
themselves
with
greater
or
less
definition
in
brayton's
mind
and
begot
action
the
process
is
what
we
call
consideration
and
decision
it
is
thus
that
we
are
wise
and
unwise
it
is
thus
that
the
withered
leaf
in
an
autumn
breeze
shows
greater
or
less
intelligence
than
its
fellows
falling
upon
the
land
or
upon
the
lake
the
secret
of
human
action
is
an
open
one
something
contracts
our
muscles
does
it
matter
if
we
give
to
the
preparatory
molecular
changes
the
name
of
will
brayton
rose
to
his
feet
and
prepared
to
back
softly
away
from
the
snake
without
disturbing
it
if
possible
and
through
the
door
men
retire
so
from
the
presence
of
the
great
for
greatness
is
power
and
power
is
a
menace
he
knew
that
he
could
walk
backward
without
error
should
the
monster
follow
the
taste
which
had
plastered
the
walls
with
paintings
had
consistently
supplied
a
rack
of
murderous
oriental
weapons
from
which
he
could
snatch
one
to
suit
the
occasion
in
the
mean
time
the
snake's
eyes
burned
with
a
more
pitiless
malevolence
than
before
brayton
lifted
his
right
foot
free
of
the
floor
to
step
backward
that
moment
he
felt
a
strong
aversion
to
doing
so
i
am
accounted
brave
he
thought
is
bravery
then
no
more
than
pride
because
there
are
none
to
witness
the
shame
shall
i
retreat
he
was
steadying
himself
with
his
right
hand
upon
the
back
of
a
chair
his
foot
suspended
nonsense
he
said
aloud
i
am
not
so
great
a
coward
as
to
fear
to
seem
to
myself
afraid
he
lifted
the
foot
a
little
higher
by
slightly
bending
the
knee
and
thrust
it
sharply
to
the
floor--an
inch
in
front
of
the
other
he
could
not
think
how
that
occurred
a
trial
with
the
left
foot
had
the
same
result
it
was
again
in
advance
of
the
right
the
hand
upon
the
chair
back
was
grasping
it
the
arm
was
straight
reaching
somewhat
backward
one
might
have
said
that
he
was
reluctant
to
lose
his
hold
the
snake's
malignant
head
was
still
thrust
forth
from
the
inner
coil
as
before
the
neck
level
it
had
not
moved
but
its
eyes
were
now
electric
sparks
radiating
an
infinity
of
luminous
needles
the
man
had
an
ashy
pallor
again
he
took
a
step
forward
and
another
partly
dragging
the
chair
which
when
finally
released
fell
upon
the
floor
with
a
crash
the
man
groaned
the
snake
made
neither
sound
nor
motion
but
its
eyes
were
two
dazzling
suns
the
reptile
itself
was
wholly
concealed
by
them
they
gave
off
enlarging
rings
of
rich
and
vivid
colors
which
at
their
greatest
expansion
successively
vanished
like
soap-bubbles
they
seemed
to
approach
his
very
face
and
anon
were
an
immeasurable
distance
away
he
heard
somewhere
the
continuous
throbbing
of
a
great
drum
with
desultory
bursts
of
far
music
inconceivably
sweet
like
the
tones
of
an
ã¦olian
harp
he
knew
it
for
the
sunrise
melody
of
memnon's
statue
and
thought
he
stood
in
the
nileside
reeds
hearing
with
exalted
sense
that
immortal
anthem
through
the
silence
of
the
centuries
the
music
ceased
rather
it
became
by
insensible
degrees
the
distant
roll
of
a
retreating
thunder-storm
a
landscape
glittering
with
sun
and
rain
stretched
before
him
arched
with
a
vivid
rainbow
framing
in
its
giant
curve
a
hundred
visible
cities
in
the
middle
distance
a
vast
serpent
wearing
a
crown
reared
its
head
out
of
its
voluminous
convolutions
and
looked
at
him
with
his
dead
mother's
eyes
suddenly
this
enchanting
landscape
seemed
to
rise
swiftly
upward
like
the
drop
scene
at
a
theatre
and
vanished
in
a
blank
something
struck
him
a
hard
blow
upon
the
face
and
breast
he
had
fallen
to
the
floor
the
blood
ran
from
his
broken
nose
and
his
bruised
lips
for
a
time
he
was
dazed
and
stunned
and
lay
with
closed
eyes
his
face
against
the
floor
in
a
few
moments
he
had
recovered
and
then
knew
that
this
fall
by
withdrawing
his
eyes
had
broken
the
spell
that
held
him
he
felt
that
now
by
keeping
his
gaze
averted
he
would
be
able
to
retreat
but
the
thought
of
the
serpent
within
a
few
feet
of
his
head
yet
unseen--perhaps
in
the
very
act
of
springing
upon
him
and
throwing
its
coils
about
his
throat--
was
too
horrible
he
lifted
his
head
stared
again
into
those
baleful
eyes
and
was
again
in
bondage
the
snake
had
not
moved
and
appeared
somewhat
to
have
lost
its
power
upon
the
imagination
the
gorgeous
illusions
of
a
few
moments
before
were
not
repeated
beneath
that
flat
and
brainless
brow
its
black
beady
eyes
simply
glittered
as
at
first
with
an
expression
unspeakably
malignant
it
was
as
if
the
creature
assured
of
its
triumph
had
determined
to
practise
no
more
alluring
wiles
now
ensued
a
fearful
scene
the
man
prone
upon
the
floor
within
a
yard
of
his
enemy
raised
the
upper
part
of
his
body
upon
his
elbows
his
head
thrown
back
his
legs
extended
to
their
full
length
his
face
was
white
between
its
stains
of
blood
his
eyes
were
strained
open
to
their
uttermost
expansion
there
was
froth
upon
his
lips
it
dropped
off
in
flakes
strong
convulsions
ran
through
his
body
making
almost
serpentile
undulations
he
bent
himself
at
the
waist
shifting
his
legs
from
side
to
side
and
every
movement
left
him
a
little
nearer
to
the
snake
he
thrust
his
hands
forward
to
brace
himself
back
yet
constantly
advanced
upon
his
elbows
iv
dr
druring
and
his
wife
sat
in
the
library
the
scientist
was
in
rare
good
humor
i
have
just
obtained
by
exchange
with
another
collector
he
said
a
splendid
specimen
of
the
ophiophagus
and
what
may
that
be
the
lady
inquired
with
a
somewhat
languid
interest
why
bless
my
soul
what
profound
ignorance
my
dear
a
man
who
ascertains
after
marriage
that
his
wife
does
not
know
greek
is
entitled
to
a
divorce
the
ophiophagus
is
a
snake
that
eats
other
snakes
i
hope
it
will
eat
all
yours
she
said
absently
shifting
the
lamp
but
how
does
it
get
the
other
snakes
by
charming
them
i
suppose
that
is
just
like
you
dear
said
the
doctor
with
an
affectation
of
petulance
you
know
how
irritating
to
me
is
any
allusion
to
that
vulgar
superstition
about
a
snake's
power
of
fascination
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
mighty
cry
which
rang
through
the
silent
house
like
the
voice
of
a
demon
shouting
in
a
tomb
again
and
yet
again
it
sounded
with
terrible
distinctness
they
sprang
to
their
feet
the
man
confused
the
lady
pale
and
speechless
with
fright
almost
before
the
echoes
of
the
last
cry
had
died
away
the
doctor
was
out
of
the
room
springing
up
the
stairs
two
steps
at
a
time
in
the
corridor
in
front
of
brayton's
chamber
he
met
some
servants
who
had
come
from
the
upper
floor
together
they
rushed
at
the
door
without
knocking
it
was
unfastened
and
gave
way
brayton
lay
upon
his
stomach
on
the
floor
dead
his
head
and
arms
were
partly
concealed
under
the
foot
rail
of
the
bed
they
pulled
the
body
away
turning
it
upon
the
back
the
face
was
daubed
with
blood
and
froth
the
eyes
were
wide
open
staring--a
dreadful
sight
died
in
a
fit
said
the
scientist
bending
his
knee
and
placing
his
hand
upon
the
heart
while
in
that
position
he
chanced
to
look
under
the
bed
good
god
he
added
how
did
this
thing
get
in
here
he
reached
under
the
bed
pulled
out
the
snake
and
flung
it
still
coiled
to
the
center
of
the
room
whence
with
a
harsh
shuffling
sound
it
slid
across
the
polished
floor
till
stopped
by
the
wall
where
it
lay
without
motion
it
was
a
stuffed
snake
its
eyes
were
two
shoe
buttons
a
holy
terror
i
there
was
an
entire
lack
of
interest
in
the
latest
arrival
at
hurdy-gurdy
he
was
not
even
christened
with
the
picturesquely
descriptive
nick-name
which
is
so
frequently
a
mining
camp's
word
of
welcome
to
the
newcomer
in
almost
any
other
camp
thereabout
this
circumstance
would
of
itself
have
secured
him
some
such
appellation
as
the
white-headed
conundrum
or
no
sarvey--an
expression
naively
supposed
to
suggest
to
quick
intelligences
the
spanish
quien
sabe
he
came
without
provoking
a
ripple
of
concern
upon
the
social
surface
of
hurdy-gurdy--a
place
which
to
the
general
californian
contempt
of
men's
personal
history
superadded
a
local
indifference
of
its
own
the
time
was
long
past
when
it
was
of
any
importance
who
came
there
or
if
anybody
came
no
one
was
living
at
hurdy-gurdy
two
years
before
the
camp
had
boasted
a
stirring
population
of
two
or
three
thousand
males
and
not
fewer
than
a
dozen
females
a
majority
of
the
former
had
done
a
few
weeks'
earnest
work
in
demonstrating
to
the
disgust
of
the
latter
the
singularly
mendacious
character
of
the
person
whose
ingenious
tales
of
rich
gold
deposits
had
lured
them
thither--
work
by
the
way
in
which
there
was
as
little
mental
satisfaction
as
pecuniary
profit
for
a
bullet
from
the
pistol
of
a
public-spirited
citizen
had
put
that
imaginative
gentleman
beyond
the
reach
of
aspersion
on
the
third
day
of
the
camp's
existence
still
his
fiction
had
a
certain
foundation
in
fact
and
many
had
lingered
a
considerable
time
in
and
about
hurdy-gurdy
though
now
all
had
been
long
gone
but
they
had
left
ample
evidence
of
their
sojourn
from
the
point
where
injun
creek
falls
into
the
rio
san
juan
smith
up
along
both
banks
of
the
former
into
the
caã±on
whence
it
emerges
extended
a
double
row
of
forlorn
shanties
that
seemed
about
to
fall
upon
one
another's
neck
to
bewail
their
desolation
while
about
an
equal
number
appeared
to
have
straggled
up
the
slope
on
either
hand
and
perched
themselves
upon
commanding
eminences
whence
they
craned
forward
to
get
a
good
view
of
the
affecting
scene
most
of
these
habitations
were
emaciated
as
by
famine
to
the
condition
of
mere
skeletons
about
which
clung
unlovely
tatters
of
what
might
have
been
skin
but
was
really
canvas
the
little
valley
itself
torn
and
gashed
by
pick
and
shovel
was
unhandsome
with
long
bending
lines
of
decaying
flume
resting
here
and
there
upon
the
summits
of
sharp
ridges
and
stilting
awkwardly
across
the
intervals
upon
unhewn
poles
the
whole
place
presented
that
raw
and
forbidding
aspect
of
arrested
development
which
is
a
new
country's
substitute
for
the
solemn
grace
of
ruin
wrought
by
time
wherever
there
remained
a
patch
of
the
original
soil
a
rank
overgrowth
of
weeds
and
brambles
had
spread
upon
the
scene
and
from
its
dank
unwholesome
shades
the
visitor
curious
in
such
matters
might
have
obtained
numberless
souvenirs
of
the
camp's
former
glory--fellowless
boots
mantled
with
green
mould
and
plethoric
of
rotting
leaves
an
occasional
old
felt
hat
desultory
remnants
of
a
flannel
shirt
sardine
boxes
inhumanly
mutilated
and
a
surprising
profusion
of
black
bottles
distributed
with
a
truly
catholic
impartiality
everywhere
ii
the
man
who
had
now
rediscovered
hurdy-gurdy
was
evidently
not
curious
as
to
its
archã¦ology
nor
as
he
looked
about
him
upon
the
dismal
evidences
of
wasted
work
and
broken
hopes
their
dispiriting
significance
accentuated
by
the
ironical
pomp
of
a
cheap
gilding
by
the
rising
sun
did
he
supplement
his
sigh
of
weariness
by
one
of
sensibility
he
simply
removed
from
the
back
of
his
tired
burro
a
miner's
outfit
a
trifle
larger
than
the
animal
itself
picketed
that
creature
and
selecting
a
hatchet
from
his
kit
moved
off
at
once
across
the
dry
bed
of
injun
creek
to
the
top
of
a
low
gravelly
hill
beyond
stepping
across
a
prostrate
fence
of
brush
and
boards
he
picked
up
one
of
the
latter
split
it
into
five
parts
and
sharpened
them
at
one
end
he
then
began
a
kind
of
search
occasionally
stooping
to
examine
something
with
close
attention
at
last
his
patient
scrutiny
appeared
to
be
rewarded
with
success
for
he
suddenly
erected
his
figure
to
its
full
height
made
a
gesture
of
satisfaction
pronounced
the
word
scarry
and
at
once
strode
away
with
long
equal
steps
which
he
counted
then
he
stopped
and
drove
one
of
his
stakes
into
the
earth
he
then
looked
carefully
about
him
measured
off
a
number
of
paces
over
a
singularly
uneven
ground
and
hammered
in
another
pacing
off
twice
the
distance
at
a
right
angle
to
his
former
course
he
drove
down
a
third
and
repeating
the
process
sank
home
the
fourth
and
then
a
fifth
this
he
split
at
the
top
and
in
the
cleft
inserted
an

staked
off
a
hill
claim
in
strict
accordance
with
the
local
mining
laws
of
hurdy-gurdy
and
put
up
the
customary
notice
it
is
necessary
to
explain
that
one
of
the
adjuncts
to
hurdy-gurdy--one
to
which
that
metropolis
became
afterward
itself
an
adjunct--was
a
cemetery
in
the
first
week
of
the
camp's
existence
this
had
been
thoughtfully
laid
out
by
a
committee
of
citizens
the
day
after
had
been
signalized
by
a
debate
between
two
members
of
the
committee
with
reference
to
a
more
eligible
site
and
on
the
third
day
the
necropolis
was
inaugurated
by
a
double
funeral
as
the
camp
had
waned
the
cemetery
had
waxed
and
long
before
the
ultimate
inhabitant
victorious
alike
over
the
insidious
malaria
and
the
forthright
revolver
had
turned
the
tail
of
his
pack-ass
upon
injun
creek
the
outlying
settlement
had
become
a
populous
if
not
popular
suburb
and
now
when
the
town
was
fallen
into
the
sere
and
yellow
leaf
of
an
unlovely
senility
the
graveyard--though
somewhat
marred
by
time
and
circumstance
and
not
altogether
exempt
from
innovations
in
grammar
and
experiments
in
orthography
to
say
nothing
of
the
devastating
coyote--answered
the
humble
needs
of
its
denizens
with
reasonable
completeness
it
comprised
a
generous
two
acres
of
ground
which
with
commendable
thrift
but
needless
care
had
been
selected
for
its
mineral
unworth
contained
two
or
three
skeleton
trees
one
of
which
had
a
stout
lateral
branch
from
which
a
weather-wasted
rope
still
significantly
dangled
half
a
hundred
gravelly
mounds
a
score
of
rude
headboards
displaying
the
literary
peculiarities
above
mentioned
and
a
struggling
colony
of
prickly
pears
altogether
god's
location
as
with
characteristic
reverence
it
had
been
called
could
justly
boast
of
an
indubitably
superior
quality
of
desolation
it
was
in
the
most
thickly
settled
part
of
this
interesting
demesne
that
mr
jefferson
doman
staked
off
his
claim
if
in
the
prosecution
of
his
design
he
should
deem
it
expedient
to
remove
any
of
the
dead
they
would
have
the
right
to
be
suitably
reinterred
iii
this
mr
jefferson
doman
was
from
elizabethtown
new
jersey
where
six
years
before
he
had
left
his
heart
in
the
keeping
of
a
golden-haired
demure-mannered
young
woman
named
mary
matthews
as
collateral
security
for
his
return
to
claim
her
hand
i
just
know
you'll
never
get
back
alive--you
never
do
succeed
in
anything
was
the
remark
which
illustrated
miss
matthews's
notion
of
what
constituted
success
and
inferentially
her
view
of
the
nature
of
encouragement
she
added
if
you
don't
i'll
go
to
california
too
i
can
put
the
coins
in
little
bags
as
you
dig
them
out
this
characteristically
feminine
theory
of
auriferous
deposits
did
not
commend
itself
to
the
masculine
intelligence
it
was
mr
doman's
belief
that
gold
was
found
in
a
liquid
state
he
deprecated
her
intent
with
considerable
enthusiasm
suppressed
her
sobs
with
a
light
hand
upon
her
mouth
laughed
in
her
eyes
as
he
kissed
away
her
tears
and
with
a
cheerful
ta-ta
went
to
california
to
labor
for
her
through
the
long
loveless
years
with
a
strong
heart
an
alert
hope
and
a
steadfast
fidelity
that
never
for
a
moment
forgot
what
it
was
about
in
the
mean
time
miss
matthews
had
granted
a
monopoly
of
her
humble
talent
for
sacking
up
coins
to
mr
jo
seeman
of
new
york
gambler
by
whom
it
was
better
appreciated
than
her
commanding
genius
for
unsacking
and
bestowing
them
upon
his
local
rivals
of
this
latter
aptitude
indeed
he
manifested
his
disapproval
by
an
act
which
secured
him
the
position
of
clerk
of
the
laundry
in
the
state
prison
and
for
her
the
sobriquet
of
split-faced
moll
at
about
this
time
she
wrote
to
mr
doman
a
touching
letter
of
renunciation
inclosing
her
photograph
to
prove
that
she
had
no
longer
had
a
right
to
indulge
the
dream
of
becoming
mrs
doman
and
recounting
so
graphically
her
fall
from
a
horse
that
the
staid
plug
upon
which
mr
doman
had
ridden
into
red
dog
to
get
the
letter
made
vicarious
atonement
under
the
spur
all
the
way
back
to
camp
the
letter
failed
in
a
signal
way
to
accomplish
its
object
the
fidelity
which
had
before
been
to
mr
doman
a
matter
of
love
and
duty
was
thenceforth
a
matter
of
honor
also
and
the
photograph
showing
the
once
pretty
face
sadly
disfigured
as
by
the
slash
of
a
knife
was
duly
instated
in
his
affections
and
its
more
comely
predecessor
treated
with
contumelious
neglect
on
being
informed
of
this
miss
matthews
it
is
only
fair
to
say
appeared
less
surprised
than
from
the
apparently
low
estimate
of
mr
doman's
generosity
which
the
tone
of
her
former
letter
attested
one
would
naturally
have
expected
her
to
be
soon
after
however
her
letters
grew
infrequent
and
then
ceased
altogether
but
mr
doman
had
another
correspondent
mr
barney
bree
of
hurdy-gurdy
formerly
of
red
dog
this
gentleman
although
a
notable
figure
among
miners
was
not
a
miner
his
knowledge
of
mining
consisted
mainly
in
a
marvelous
command
of
its
slang
to
which
he
made
copious
contributions
enriching
its
vocabulary
with
a
wealth
of
uncommon
phrases
more
remarkable
for
their
aptness
than
their
refinement
and
which
impressed
the
unlearned
tenderfoot
with
a
lively
sense
of
the
profundity
of
their
inventor's
acquirements
when
not
entertaining
a
circle
of
admiring
auditors
from
san
francisco
or
the
east
he
could
commonly
be
found
pursuing
the
comparatively
obscure
industry
of
sweeping
out
the
various
dance
houses
and
purifying
the
cuspidors
barney
had
apparently
but
two
passions
in
life--love
of
jefferson
doman
who
had
once
been
of
some
service
to
him
and
love
of
whisky
which
certainly
had
not
he
had
been
among
the
first
in
the
rush
to
hurdy-gurdy
but
had
not
prospered
and
had
sunk
by
degrees
to
the
position
of
grave
digger
this
was
not
a
vocation
but
barney
in
a
desultory
way
turned
his
trembling
hand
to
it
whenever
some
local
misunderstanding
at
the
card
table
and
his
own
partial
recovery
from
a
prolonged
debauch
occurred
coincidently
in
point
of
time
one
day
mr
doman
received
at
red
dog
a
letter
with
the
simple
postmark
hurdy
cal
and
being
occupied
with
another
matter
carelessly
thrust
it
into
a
chink
of
his
cabin
for
future
perusal
some
two
years
later
it
was
accidentally
dislodged
and
he
read
it
it
ran
as
follows--
hurdy
june
6
friend
jeff
i've
hit
her
hard
in
the
boneyard
she's
blind
and
lousy
i'm
on
the
divvy--that's
me
and
mum's
my
lay
till
you
toot
yours
barney
ps--i've
clayed
her
with
scarry
with
some
knowledge
of
the
general
mining
camp
argot
and
of
mr
bree's
private
system
for
the
communication
of
ideas
mr
doman
had
no
difficulty
in
understanding
by
this
uncommon
epistle
that
barney
while
performing
his
duty
as
grave
digger
had
uncovered
a
quartz
ledge
with
no
outcroppings
that
it
was
visibly
rich
in
free
gold
that
moved
by
considerations
of
friendship
he
was
willing
to
accept
mr
doman
as
a
partner
and
awaiting
that
gentleman's
declaration
of
his
will
in
the
matter
would
discreetly
keep
the
discovery
a
secret
from
the
postscript
it
was
plainly
inferable
that
in
order
to
conceal
the
treasure
he
had
buried
above
it
the
mortal
part
of
a
person
named
scarry
from
subsequent
events
as
related
to
mr
doman
at
red
dog
it
would
appear
that
before
taking
this
precaution
mr
bree
must
have
had
the
thrift
to
remove
a
modest
competency
of
the
gold
at
any
rate
it
was
at
about
that
time
that
he
entered
upon
that
memorable
series
of
potations
and
treatings
which
is
still
one
of
the
cherished
traditions
of
the
san
juan
smith
country
and
is
spoken
of
with
respect
as
far
away
as
ghost
rock
and
lone
hand
at
its
conclusion
some
former
citizens
of
hurdy-gurdy
for
whom
he
had
performed
the
last
kindly
office
at
the
cemetery
made
room
for
him
among
them
and
he
rested
well
iv
having
finished
staking
off
his
claim
mr
doman
walked
back
to
the
centre
of
it
and
stood
again
at
the
spot
where
his
search
among
the
graves
had
expired
in
the
exclamation
scarry
he
bent
again
over
the
headboard
that
bore
that
name
and
as
if
to
reinforce
the
senses
of
sight
and
hearing
ran
his
forefinger
along
the
rudely
carved
letters
re-erecting
himself
he
appended
orally
to
the
simple
inscription
the
shockingly
forthright
epitaph
she
was
a
holy
terror
had
mr
doman
been
required
to
make
these
words
good
with
proof--as
considering
their
somewhat
censorious
character
he
doubtless
should
have
been--he
would
have
found
himself
embarrassed
by
the
absence
of
reputable
witnesses
and
hearsay
evidence
would
have
been
the
best
he
could
command
at
the
time
when
scarry
had
been
prevalent
in
the
mining
camps
thereabout--when
as
the
editor
of
the
hurdy
herald
would
have
phrased
it
she
was
in
the
plenitude
of
her
power--mr
doman's
fortunes
had
been
at
a
low
ebb
and
he
had
led
the
vagrantly
laborious
life
of
a
prospector
his
time
had
been
mostly
spent
in
the
mountains
now
with
one
companion
now
with
another
it
was
from
the
admiring
recitals
of
these
casual
partners
fresh
from
the
various
camps
that
his
judgment
of
scarry
had
been
made
up
he
himself
had
never
had
the
doubtful
advantage
of
her
acquaintance
and
the
precarious
distinction
of
her
favor
and
when
finally
on
the
termination
of
her
perverse
career
at
hurdy-gurdy
he
had
read
in
a
chance
copy
of
the
herald
her
column-long
obituary
written
by
the
local
humorist
of
that
lively
sheet
in
the
highest
style
of
his
art
doman
had
paid
to
her
memory
and
to
her
historiographer's
genius
the
tribute
of
a
smile
and
chivalrously
forgotten
her
standing
now
at
the
grave-side
of
this
mountain
messalina
he
recalled
the
leading
events
of
her
turbulent
career
as
he
had
heard
them
celebrated
at
his
several
campfires
and
perhaps
with
an
unconscious
attempt
at
self-justification
repeated
that
she
was
a
holy
terror
and
sank
his
pick
into
her
grave
up
to
the
handle
at
that
moment
a
raven
which
had
silently
settled
upon
a
branch
of
the
blasted
tree
above
his
head
solemnly
snapped
its
beak
and
uttered
its
mind
about
the
matter
with
an
approving
croak
pursuing
his
discovery
of
free
gold
with
great
zeal
which
he
probably
credited
to
his
conscience
as
a
grave
digger
mr
barney
bree
had
made
an
unusually
deep
sepulcher
and
it
was
near
sunset
before
mr
doman
laboring
with
the
leisurely
deliberation
of
one
who
has
a
dead
sure
thing
and
no
fear
of
an
adverse
claimant's
enforcement
of
a
prior
right
reached
the
coffin
and
uncovered
it
when
he
had
done
so
he
was
confronted
by
a
difficulty
for
which
he
had
made
no
provision
the
coffin--a
mere
flat
shell
of
not
very
well-preserved
redwood
boards
apparently--had
no
handles
and
it
filled
the
entire
bottom
of
the
excavation
the
best
he
could
do
without
violating
the
decent
sanctities
of
the
situation
was
to
make
the
excavation
sufficiently
longer
to
enable
him
to
stand
at
the
head
of
the
casket
and
getting
his
powerful
hands
underneath
erect
it
upon
its
narrower
end
and
this
he
proceeded
to
do
the
approach
of
night
quickened
his
efforts
he
had
no
thought
of
abandoning
his
task
at
this
stage
to
resume
it
on
the
morrow
under
more
advantageous
conditions
the
feverish
stimulation
of
cupidity
and
the
fascination
of
terror
held
him
to
his
dismal
work
with
an
iron
authority
he
no
longer
idled
but
wrought
with
a
terrible
zeal
his
head
uncovered
his
outer
garments
discarded
his
shirt
opened
at
the
neck
and
thrown
back
from
his
breast
down
which
ran
sinuous
rills
of
perspiration
this
hardy
and
impenitent
gold-getter
and
grave-robber
toiled
with
a
giant
energy
that
almost
dignified
the
character
of
his
horrible
purpose
and
when
the
sun
fringes
had
burned
themselves
out
along
the
crest
line
of
the
western
hills
and
the
full
moon
had
climbed
out
of
the
shadows
that
lay
along
the
purple
plain
he
had
erected
the
coffin
upon
its
foot
where
it
stood
propped
against
the
end
of
the
open
grave
then
standing
up
to
his
neck
in
the
earth
at
the
opposite
extreme
of
the
excavation
as
he
looked
at
the
coffin
upon
which
the
moonlight
now
fell
with
a
full
illumination
he
was
thrilled
with
a
sudden
terror
to
observe
upon
it
the
startling
apparition
of
a
dark
human
head--the
shadow
of
his
own
for
a
moment
this
simple
and
natural
circumstance
unnerved
him
the
noise
of
his
labored
breathing
frightened
him
and
he
tried
to
still
it
but
his
bursting
lungs
would
not
be
denied
then
laughing
half-audibly
and
wholly
without
spirit
he
began
making
movements
of
his
head
from
side
to
side
in
order
to
compel
the
apparition
to
repeat
them
he
found
a
comforting
reassurance
in
asserting
his
command
over
his
own
shadow
he
was
temporizing
making
with
unconscious
prudence
a
dilatory
opposition
to
an
impending
catastrophe
he
felt
that
invisible
forces
of
evil
were
closing
in
upon
him
and
he
parleyed
for
time
with
the
inevitable
he
now
observed
in
succession
several
unusual
circumstances
the
surface
of
the
coffin
upon
which
his
eyes
were
fastened
was
not
flat
it
presented
two
distinct
ridges
one
longitudinal
and
the
other
transverse
where
these
intersected
at
the
widest
part
there
was
a
corroded
metallic
plate
that
reflected
the
moonlight
with
a
dismal
lustre
along
the
outer
edges
of
the
coffin
at
long
intervals
were
rust-eaten
heads
of
nails
this
frail
product
of
the
carpenter's
art
had
been
put
into
the
grave
the
wrong
side
up
perhaps
it
was
one
of
the
humors
of
the
camp--a
practical
manifestation
of
the
facetious
spirit
that
had
found
literary
expression
in
the
topsy-turvy
obituary
notice
from
the
pen
of
hurdy-gurdy's
great
humorist
perhaps
it
had
some
occult
personal
signification
impenetrable
to
understandings
uninstructed
in
local
traditions
a
more
charitable
hypothesis
is
that
it
was
owing
to
a
misadventure
on
the
part
of
mr
barney
bree
who
making
the
interment
unassisted
either
by
choice
for
the
conservation
of
his
golden
secret
or
through
public
apathy
had
committed
a
blunder
which
he
was
afterward
unable
or
unconcerned
to
rectify
however
it
had
come
about
poor
scarry
had
indubitably
been
put
into
the
earth
face
downward
when
terror
and
absurdity
make
alliance
the
effect
is
frightful
this
strong-hearted
and
daring
man
this
hardy
night
worker
among
the
dead
this
defiant
antagonist
of
darkness
and
desolation
succumbed
to
a
ridiculous
surprise
he
was
smitten
with
a
thrilling
chill--shivered
and
shook
his
massive
shoulders
as
if
to
throw
off
an
icy
hand
he
no
longer
breathed
and
the
blood
in
his
veins
unable
to
abate
its
impetus
surged
hotly
beneath
his
cold
skin
unleavened
with
oxygen
it
mounted
to
his
head
and
congested
his
brain
his
physical
functions
had
gone
over
to
the
enemy
his
very
heart
was
arrayed
against
him
he
did
not
move
he
could
not
have
cried
out
he
needed
but
a
coffin
to
be
dead--as
dead
as
the
death
that
confronted
him
with
only
the
length
of
an
open
grave
and
the
thickness
of
a
rotting
plank
between
then
one
by
one
his
senses
returned
the
tide
of
terror
that
had
overwhelmed
his
faculties
began
to
recede
but
with
the
return
of
his
senses
he
became
singularly
unconscious
of
the
object
of
his
fear
he
saw
the
moonlight
gilding
the
coffin
but
no
longer
the
coffin
that
it
gilded
raising
his
eyes
and
turning
his
head
he
noted
curiously
and
with
surprise
the
black
branches
of
the
dead
tree
and
tried
to
estimate
the
length
of
the
weather-worn
rope
that
dangled
from
its
ghostly
hand
the
monotonous
barking
of
distant
coyotes
affected
him
as
something
he
had
heard
years
ago
in
a
dream
an
owl
flapped
awkwardly
above
him
on
noiseless
wings
and
he
tried
to
forecast
the
direction
of
its
flight
when
it
should
encounter
the
cliff
that
reared
its
illuminated
front
a
mile
away
his
hearing
took
account
of
a
gopher's
stealthy
tread
in
the
shadow
of
the
cactus
he
was
intensely
observant
his
senses
were
all
alert
but
he
saw
not
the
coffin
as
one
can
gaze
at
the
sun
until
it
looks
black
and
then
vanishes
so
his
mind
having
exhausted
its
capacities
of
dread
was
no
longer
conscious
of
the
separate
existence
of
anything
dreadful
the
assassin
was
cloaking
the
sword
it
was
during
this
lull
in
the
battle
that
he
became
sensible
of
a
faint
sickening
odor
at
first
he
thought
it
was
that
of
a
rattle-snake
and
involuntarily
tried
to
look
about
his
feet
they
were
nearly
invisible
in
the
gloom
of
the
grave
a
hoarse
gurgling
sound
like
the
death-rattle
in
a
human
throat
seemed
to
come
out
of
the
sky
and
a
moment
later
a
great
black
angular
shadow
like
the
same
sound
made
visible
dropped
curving
from
the
topmost
branch
of
the
spectral
tree
fluttered
for
an
instant
before
his
face
and
sailed
fiercely
away
into
the
mist
along
the
creek
it
was
the
raven
the
incident
recalled
him
to
a
sense
of
the
situation
and
again
his
eyes
sought
the
upright
coffin
now
illuminated
by
the
moon
for
half
its
length
he
saw
the
gleam
of
the
metallic
plate
and
tried
without
moving
to
decipher
the
inscription
then
he
fell
to
speculating
upon
what
was
behind
it
his
creative
imagination
presented
him
a
vivid
picture
the
planks
no
longer
seemed
an
obstacle
to
his
vision
and
he
saw
the
livid
corpse
of
the
dead
woman
standing
in
grave-clothes
and
staring
vacantly
at
him
with
lidless
shrunken
eyes
the
lower
jaw
was
fallen
the
upper
lip
drawn
away
from
the
uncovered
teeth
he
could
make
out
a
mottled
pattern
on
the
hollow
cheeks--the
maculations
of
decay
by
some
mysterious
process
his
mind
reverted
for
the
first
time
that
day
to
the
photograph
of
mary
matthews
he
contrasted
its
blonde
beauty
with
the
forbidding
aspect
of
this
dead
face--the
most
beloved
object
that
he
knew
with
the
most
hideous
that
he
could
conceive
the
assassin
now
advanced
and
displaying
the
blade
laid
it
against
the
victim's
throat
that
is
to
say
the
man
became
at
first
dimly
then
definitely
aware
of
an
impressive
coincidence--a
relation--a
parallel
between
the
face
on
the
card
and
the
name
on
the
headboard
the
one
was
disfigured
the
other
described
a
disfiguration
the
thought
took
hold
of
him
and
shook
him
it
transformed
the
face
that
his
imagination
had
created
behind
the
coffin
lid
the
contrast
became
a
resemblance
the
resemblance
grew
to
identity
remembering
the
many
descriptions
of
scarry's
personal
appearance
that
he
had
heard
from
the
gossips
of
his
camp-fire
he
tried
with
imperfect
success
to
recall
the
exact
nature
of
the
disfiguration
that
had
given
the
woman
her
ugly
name
and
what
was
lacking
in
his
memory
fancy
supplied
stamping
it
with
the
validity
of
conviction
in
the
maddening
attempt
to
recall
such
scraps
of
the
woman's
history
as
he
had
heard
the
muscles
of
his
arms
and
hands
were
strained
to
a
painful
tension
as
by
an
effort
to
lift
a
great
weight
his
body
writhed
and
twisted
with
the
exertion
the
tendons
of
his
neck
stood
out
as
tense
as
whip-cords
and
his
breath
came
in
short
sharp
gasps
the
catastrophe
could
not
be
much
longer
delayed
or
the
agony
of
anticipation
would
leave
nothing
to
be
done
by
the
coup
de
grã¢ce
of
verification
the
scarred
face
behind
the
lid
would
slay
him
through
the
wood
a
movement
of
the
coffin
diverted
his
thought
it
came
forward
to
within
a
foot
of
his
face
growing
visibly
larger
as
it
approached
the
rusted
metallic
plate
with
an
inscription
illegible
in
the
moonlight
looked
him
steadily
in
the
eye
determined
not
to
shrink
he
tried
to
brace
his
shoulders
more
firmly
against
the
end
of
the
excavation
and
nearly
fell
backward
in
the
attempt
there
was
nothing
to
support
him
he
had
unconsciously
moved
upon
his
enemy
clutching
the
heavy
knife
that
he
had
drawn
from
his
belt
the
coffin
had
not
advanced
and
he
smiled
to
think
it
could
not
retreat
lifting
his
knife
he
struck
the
heavy
hilt
against
the
metal
plate
with
all
his
power
there
was
a
sharp
ringing
percussion
and
with
a
dull
clatter
the
whole
decayed
coffin
lid
broke
in
pieces
and
came
away
falling
about
his
feet
the
quick
and
the
dead
were
face
to
face--the
frenzied
shrieking
man--the
woman
standing
tranquil
in
her
silences
she
was
a
holy
terror
v
some
months
later
a
party
of
men
and
women
belonging
to
the
highest
social
circles
of
san
francisco
passed
through
hurdy-gurdy
on
their
way
to
the
yosemite
valley
by
a
new
trail
they
halted
for
dinner
and
during
its
preparation
explored
the
desolate
camp
one
of
the
party
had
been
at
hurdy-gurdy
in
the
days
of
its
glory
he
had
indeed
been
one
of
its
prominent
citizens
and
it
used
to
be
said
that
more
money
passed
over
his
faro
table
in
any
one
night
than
over
those
of
all
his
competitors
in
a
week
but
being
now
a
millionaire
engaged
in
greater
enterprises
he
did
not
deem
these
early
successes
of
sufficient
importance
to
merit
the
distinction
of
remark
his
invalid
wife
a
lady
famous
in
san
francisco
for
the
costly
nature
of
her
entertainments
and
her
exacting
rigor
with
regard
to
the
social
position
and
antecedents
of
those
who
attended
them
accompanied
the
expedition
during
a
stroll
among
the
shanties
of
the
abandoned
camp
mr
porfer
directed
the
attention
of
his
wife
and
friends
to
a
dead
tree
on
a
low
hill
beyond
injun
creek
as
i
told
you
he
said
i
passed
through
this
camp
in
1852
and
was
told
that
no
fewer
than
five
men
had
been
hanged
here
by
vigilantes
at
different
times
and
all
on
that
tree
if
i
am
not
mistaken
a
rope
is
dangling
from
it
yet
let
us
go
over
and
see
the
place
mr
porfer
did
not
add
that
the
rope
in
question
was
perhaps
the
very
one
from
whose
fatal
embrace
his
own
neck
had
once
had
an
escape
so
narrow
that
an
hour's
delay
in
taking
himself
out
of
that
region
would
have
spanned
it
proceeding
leisurely
down
the
creek
to
a
convenient
crossing
the
party
came
upon
the
cleanly
picked
skeleton
of
an
animal
which
mr
porfer
after
due
examination
pronounced
to
be
that
of
an
ass
the
distinguishing
ears
were
gone
but
much
of
the
inedible
head
had
been
spared
by
the
beasts
and
birds
and
the
stout
bridle
of
horsehair
was
intact
as
was
the
riata
of
similar
material
connecting
it
with
a
picket
pin
still
firmly
sunken
in
the
earth
the
wooden
and
metallic
elements
of
a
miner's
kit
lay
near
by
the
customary
remarks
were
made
cynical
on
the
part
of
the
men
sentimental
and
refined
by
the
lady
a
little
later
they
stood
by
the
tree
in
the
cemetery
and
mr
porfer
sufficiently
unbent
from
his
dignity
to
place
himself
beneath
the
rotten
rope
and
confidently
lay
a
coil
of
it
about
his
neck
somewhat
it
appeared
to
his
own
satisfaction
but
greatly
to
the
horror
of
his
wife
to
whose
sensibilities
the
performance
gave
a
smart
shock
an
exclamation
from
one
of
the
party
gathered
them
all
about
an
open
grave
at
the
bottom
of
which
they
saw
a
confused
mass
of
human
bones
and
the
broken
remnants
of
a
coffin
coyotes
and
buzzards
had
performed
the
last
sad
rites
for
pretty
much
all
else
two
skulls
were
visible
and
in
order
to
investigate
this
somewhat
unusual
redundancy
one
of
the
younger
men
had
the
hardihood
to
spring
into
the
grave
and
hand
them
up
to
another
before
mrs
porfer
could
indicate
her
marked
disapproval
of
so
shocking
an
act
which
nevertheless
she
did
with
considerable
feeling
and
in
very
choice
words
pursuing
his
search
among
the
dismal
debris
at
the
bottom
of
the
grave
the
young
man
next
handed
up
a
rusted
coffin
plate
with
a
rudely
cut
inscription
which
with
difficulty
mr
porfer
deciphered
and
read
aloud
with
an
earnest
and
not
altogether
unsuccessful
attempt
at
the
dramatic
effect
which
he
deemed
befitting
to
the
occasion
and
his
rhetorical
abilities
manuelita

born
at
the
mission

pedro--died
in
hurdy-gurdy
aged
47
hell's
full
of
such
in
deference
to
the
piety
of
the
reader
and
the
nerves
of
mrs
porfer's
fastidious
sisterhood
of
both
sexes
let
us
not
touch
upon
the
painful
impression
produced
by
this
uncommon
inscription
further
than
to
say
that
the
elocutionary
powers
of
mr
porfer
had
never
before
met
with
so
spontaneous
and
overwhelming
recognition
the
next
morsel
that
rewarded
the
ghoul
in
the
grave
was
a
long
tangle
of
black
hair
defiled
with
clay
but
this
was
such
an
anti-climax
that
it
received
little
attention
suddenly
with
a
short
exclamation
and
a
gesture
of
excitement
the
young
man
unearthed
a
fragment
of
grayish
rock
and
after
a
hurried
inspection
handed
it
up
to
mr
porfer
as
the
sunlight
fell
upon
it
it
glittered
with
a
yellow
luster--it
was
thickly
studded
with
gleaming
points
mr
porfer
snatched
it
bent
his
head
over
it
a
moment
and
threw
it
lightly
away
with
the
simple
remark
iron
pyrites--fool's
gold
the
young
man
in
the
discovery
shaft
was
a
trifle
disconcerted
apparently
meanwhile
mrs
porfer
unable
longer
to
endure
the
disagreeable
business
had
walked
back
to
the
tree
and
seated
herself
at
its
root
while
rearranging
a
tress
of
golden
hair
which
had
slipped
from
its
confinement
she
was
attracted
by
what
appeared
to
be
and
really
was
the
fragment
of
an
old
coat
looking
about
to
assure
herself
that
so
unladylike
an
act
was
not
observed
she
thrust
her
jeweled
hand
into
the
exposed
breast
pocket
and
drew
out
a
mouldy
pocket-book
its
contents
were
as
follows
one
bundle
of
letters
postmarked
elizabethtown
new
jersey
one
circle
of
blonde
hair
tied
with
a
ribbon
one
photograph
of
a
beautiful
girl
one
ditto
of
same
singularly
disfigured
one
name
on
back
of

doman
a
few
moments
later
a
group
of
anxious
gentlemen
surrounded
mrs
porfer
as
she
sat
motionless
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
her
head
dropped
forward
her
fingers
clutching
a
crushed
photograph
her
husband
raised
her
head
exposing
a
face
ghastly
white
except
the
long
deforming
cicatrice
familiar
to
all
her
friends
which
no
art
could
ever
hide
and
which
now
traversed
the
pallor
of
her
countenance
like
a
visible
curse
mary
matthews
porfer
had
the
bad
luck
to
be
dead
the
suitable
surroundings
the
night
one
midsummer
night
a
farmer's
boy
living
about
ten
miles
from
the
city
of
cincinnati
was
following
a
bridle
path
through
a
dense
and
dark
forest
he
had
lost
himself
while
searching
for
some
missing
cows
and
near
midnight
was
a
long
way
from
home
in
a
part
of
the
country
with
which
he
was
unfamiliar
but
he
was
a
stout-hearted
lad
and
knowing
his
general
direction
from
his
home
he
plunged
into
the
forest
without
hesitation
guided
by
the
stars
coming
into
the
bridle
path
and
observing
that
it
ran
in
the
right
direction
he
followed
it
the
night
was
clear
but
in
the
woods
it
was
exceedingly
dark
it
was
more
by
the
sense
of
touch
than
by
that
of
sight
that
the
lad
kept
the
path
he
could
not
indeed
very
easily
go
astray
the
undergrowth
on
both
sides
was
so
thick
as
to
be
almost
impenetrable
he
had
gone
into
the
forest
a
mile
or
more
when
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
feeble
gleam
of
light
shining
through
the
foliage
skirting
the
path
on
his
left
the
sight
of
it
startled
him
and
set
his
heart
beating
audibly
the
old
breede
house
is
somewhere
about
here
he
said
to
himself
this
must
be
the
other
end
of
the
path
which
we
reach
it
by
from
our
side
ugh
what
should
a
light
be
doing
there
nevertheless
he
pushed
on
a
moment
later
he
had
emerged
from
the
forest
into
a
small
open
space
mostly
upgrown
to
brambles
there
were
remnants
of
a
rotting
fence
a
few
yards
from
the
trail
in
the
middle
of
the
clearing
was
the
house
from
which
the
light
came
through
an
unglazed
window
the
window
had
once
contained
glass
but
that
and
its
supporting
frame
had
long
ago
yielded
to
missiles
flung
by
hands
of
venturesome
boys
to
attest
alike
their
courage
and
their
hostility
to
the
supernatural
for
the
breede
house
bore
the
evil
reputation
of
being
haunted
possibly
it
was
not
but
even
the
hardiest
sceptic
could
not
deny
that
it
was
deserted--which
in
rural
regions
is
much
the
same
thing
looking
at
the
mysterious
dim
light
shining
from
the
ruined
window
the
boy
remembered
with
apprehension
that
his
own
hand
had
assisted
at
the
destruction
his
penitence
was
of
course
poignant
in
proportion
to
its
tardiness
and
inefficacy
he
half
expected
to
be
set
upon
by
all
the
unworldly
and
bodiless
malevolences
whom
he
had
outraged
by
assisting
to
break
alike
their
windows
and
their
peace
yet
this
stubborn
lad
shaking
in
every
limb
would
not
retreat
the
blood
in
his
veins
was
strong
and
rich
with
the
iron
of
the
frontiersman
he
was
but
two
removes
from
the
generation
that
had
subdued
the
indian
he
started
to
pass
the
house
as
he
was
going
by
he
looked
in
at
the
blank
window
space
and
saw
a
strange
and
terrifying
sight--the
figure
of
a
man
seated
in
the
centre
of
the
room
at
a
table
upon
which
lay
some
loose
sheets
of
paper
the
elbows
rested
on
the
table
the
hands
supporting
the
head
which
was
uncovered
on
each
side
the
fingers
were
pushed
into
the
hair
the
face
showed
dead-yellow
in
the
light
of
a
single
candle
a
little
to
one
side
the
flame
illuminated
that
side
of
the
face
the
other
was
in
deep
shadow
the
man's
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
blank
window
space
with
a
stare
in
which
an
older
and
cooler
observer
might
have
discerned
something
of
apprehension
but
which
seemed
to
the
lad
altogether
soulless
he
believed
the
man
to
be
dead
the
situation
was
horrible
but
not
with
out
its
fascination
the
boy
stopped
to
note
it
all
he
was
weak
faint
and
trembling
he
could
feel
the
blood
forsaking
his
face
nevertheless
he
set
his
teeth
and
resolutely
advanced
to
the
house
he
had
no
conscious
intention--it
was
the
mere
courage
of
terror
he
thrust
his
white
face
forward
into
the
illuminated
opening
at
that
instant
a
strange
harsh
cry
a
shriek
broke
upon
the
silence
of
the
night--the
note
of
a
screech-owl
the
man
sprang
to
his
feet
overturning
the
table
and
extinguishing
the
candle
the
boy
took
to
his
heels
the
day
before
good-morning
colston
i
am
in
luck
it
seems
you
have
often
said
that
my
commendation
of
your
literary
work
was
mere
civility
and
here
you
find
me
absorbed--actually
merged--in
your
latest
story
in
the
messenger
nothing
less
shocking
than
your
touch
upon
my
shoulder
would
have
roused
me
to
consciousness
the
proof
is
stronger
than
you
seem
to
know
replied
the
man
addressed
so
keen
is
your
eagerness
to
read
my
story
that
you
are
willing
to
renounce
selfish
considerations
and
forego
all
the
pleasure
that
you
could
get
from
it
i
don't
understand
you
said
the
other
folding
the
newspaper
that
he
held
and
putting
it
into
his
pocket
you
writers
are
a
queer
lot
anyhow
come
tell
me
what
i
have
done
or
omitted
in
this
matter
in
what
way
does
the
pleasure
that
i
get
or
might
get
from
your
work
depend
on
me
in
many
ways
let
me
ask
you
how
you
would
enjoy
your
breakfast
if
you
took
it
in
this
street
car
suppose
the
phonograph
so
perfected
as
to
be
able
to
give
you
an
entire
opera--singing
orchestration
and
all
do
you
think
you
would
get
much
pleasure
out
of
it
if
you
turned
it
on
at
your
office
during
business
hours
do
you
really
care
for
a
serenade
by
schubert
when
you
hear
it
fiddled
by
an
untimely
italian
on
a
morning
ferryboat
are
you
always
cocked
and
primed
for
enjoyment
do
you
keep
every
mood
on
tap
ready
to
any
demand
let
me
remind
you
sir
that
the
story
which
you
have
done
me
the
honor
to
begin
as
a
means
of
becoming
oblivious
to
the
discomfort
of
this
car
is
a
ghost
story
well
well
has
the
reader
no
duties
corresponding
to
his
privileges
you
have
paid
five
cents
for
that
newspaper
it
is
yours
you
have
the
right
to
read
it
when
and
where
you
will
much
of
what
is
in
it
is
neither
helped
nor
harmed
by
time
and
place
and
mood
some
of
it
actually
requires
to
be
read
at
once--while
it
is
fizzing
but
my
story
is
not
of
that
character
it
is
not
'the
very
latest
advices'
from
ghostland
you
are
not
expected
to
keep
yourself
au
courant
with
what
is
going
on
in
the
realm
of
spooks
the
stuff
will
keep
until
you
have
leisure
to
put
yourself
into
the
frame
of
mind
appropriate
to
the
sentiment
of
the
piece--which
i
respectfully
submit
that
you
cannot
do
in
a
street
car
even
if
you
are
the
only
passenger
the
solitude
is
not
of
the
right
sort
an
author
has
rights
which
the
reader
is
bound
to
respect
for
specific
example
the
right
to
the
reader's
undivided
attention
to
deny
him
this
is
immoral
to
make
him
share
your
attention
with
the
rattle
of
a
street
car
the
moving
panorama
of
the
crowds
on
the
sidewalks
and
the
buildings
beyond--with
any
of
the
thousands
of
distractions
which
make
our
customary
environment--is
to
treat
him
with
gross
injustice
by
god
it
is
infamous
the
speaker
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
was
steadying
himself
by
one
of
the
straps
hanging
from
the
roof
of
the
car
the
other
man
looked
up
at
him
in
sudden
astonishment
wondering
how
so
trivial
a
grievance
could
seem
to
justify
so
strong
language
he
saw
that
his
friend's
face
was
uncommonly
pale
and
that
his
eyes
glowed
like
living
coals
you
know
what
i
mean
continued
the
writer
impetuously
crowding
his
words--you
know
what
i
mean
marsh
my
stuff
in
this
morning's
messenger
is
plainly
sub-headed
'a
ghost
story'
that
is
ample
notice
to
all
every
honorable
reader
will
understand
it
as
prescribing
by
implication
the
conditions
under
which
the
work
is
to
be
read
the
man
addressed
as
marsh
winced
a
trifle
then
asked
with
a
smile
what
conditions
you
know
that
i
am
only
a
plain
business
man
who
cannot
be
supposed
to
understand
such
things
how
when
where
should
i
read
your
ghost
story
in
solitude--at
night--by
the
light
of
a
candle
there
are
certain
emotions
which
a
writer
can
easily
enough
excite--such
as
compassion
or
merriment
i
can
move
you
to
tears
or
laughter
under
almost
any
circumstances
but
for
my
ghost
story
to
be
effective
you
must
be
made
to
feel
fear--at
least
a
strong
sense
of
the
supernatural--and
that
is
a
difficult
matter
i
have
a
right
to
expect
that
if
you
read
me
at
all
you
will
give
me
a
chance
that
you
will
make
yourself
accessible
to
the
emotion
that
i
try
to
inspire
the
car
had
now
arrived
at
its
terminus
and
stopped
the
trip
just
completed
was
its
first
for
the
day
and
the
conversation
of
the
two
early
passengers
had
not
been
interrupted
the
streets
were
yet
silent
and
desolate
the
house
tops
were
just
touched
by
the
rising
sun
as
they
stepped
from
the
car
and
walked
away
together
marsh
narrowly
eyed
his
companion
who
was
reported
like
most
men
of
uncommon
literary
ability
to
be
addicted
to
various
destructive
vices
that
is
the
revenge
which
dull
minds
take
upon
bright
ones
in
resentment
of
their
superiority
mr
colston
was
known
as
a
man
of
genius
there
are
honest
souls
who
believe
that
genius
is
a
mode
of
excess
it
was
known
that
colston
did
not
drink
liquor
but
many
said
that
he
ate
opium
something
in
his
appearance
that
morning--a
certain
wildness
of
the
eyes
an
unusual
pallor
a
thickness
and
rapidity
of
speech--were
taken
by
mr
marsh
to
confirm
the
report
nevertheless
he
had
not
the
self-denial
to
abandon
a
subject
which
he
found
interesting
however
it
might
excite
his
friend
do
you
mean
to
say
he
began
that
if
i
take
the
trouble
to
observe
your
directions--place
myself
in
the
conditions
that
you
demand
solitude
night
and
a
tallow
candle--you
can
with
your
ghostly
work
give
me
an
uncomfortable
sense
of
the
supernatural
as
you
call
it
can
you
accelerate
my
pulse
make
me
start
at
sudden
noises
send
a
nervous
chill
along
my
spine
and
cause
my
hair
to
rise
colston
turned
suddenly
and
looked
him
squarely
in
the
eyes
as
they
walked
you
would
not
dare--you
have
not
the
courage
he
said
he
emphasized
the
words
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
you
are
brave
enough
to
read
me
in
a
street
car
but--in
a
deserted
house--alone--in
the
forest--at
night
bah
i
have
a
manuscript
in
my
pocket
that
would
kill
you
marsh
was
angry
he
knew
himself
courageous
and
the
words
stung
him
if
you
know
such
a
place
he
said
take
me
there
to-night
and
leave
me
your
story
and
a
candle
call
for
me
when
i've
had
time
enough
to
read
it
and
i'll
tell
you
the
entire
plot
and--kick
you
out
of
the
place
that
is
how
it
occurred
that
the
farmer's
boy
looking
in
at
an
unglazed
window
of
the
breede
house
saw
a
man
sitting
in
the
light
of
a
candle
the
day
after
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
three
men
and
a
boy
approached
the
breede
house
from
that
point
of
the
compass
toward
which
the
boy
had
fled
the
preceding
night
the
men
were
in
high
spirits
they
talked
very
loudly
and
laughed
they
made
facetious
and
good-humored
ironical
remarks
to
the
boy
about
his
adventure
which
evidently
they
did
not
believe
in
the
boy
accepted
their
raillery
with
seriousness
making
no
reply
he
had
a
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
and
knew
that
one
who
professes
to
have
seen
a
dead
man
rise
from
his
seat
and
blow
out
a
candle
is
not
a
credible
witness
arriving
at
the
house
and
finding
the
door
unlocked
the
party
of
investigators
entered
without
ceremony
leading
out
of
the
passage
into
which
this
door
opened
was
another
on
the
right
and
one
on
the
left
they
entered
the
room
on
the
left--the
one
which
had
the
blank
front
window
here
was
the
dead
body
of
a
man
it
lay
partly
on
one
side
with
the
forearm
beneath
it
the
cheek
on
the
floor
the
eyes
were
wide
open
the
stare
was
not
an
agreeable
thing
to
encounter
the
lower
jaw
had
fallen
a
little
pool
of
saliva
had
collected
beneath
the
mouth
an
overthrown
table
a
partly
burned
candle
a
chair
and
some
paper
with
writing
on
it
were
all
else
that
the
room
contained
the
men
looked
at
the
body
touching
the
face
in
turn
the
boy
gravely
stood
at
the
head
assuming
a
look
of
ownership
it
was
the
proudest
moment
of
his
life
one
of
the
men
said
to
him
you're
a
good
'un--a
remark
which
was
received
by
the
two
others
with
nods
of
acquiescence
it
was
scepticism
apologizing
to
truth
then
one
of
the
men
took
from
the
floor
the
sheet
of
manuscript
and
stepped
to
the
window
for
already
the
evening
shadows
were
glooming
the
forest
the
song
of
the
whip-poor-will
was
heard
in
the
distance
and
a
monstrous
beetle
sped
by
the
window
on
roaring
wings
and
thundered
away
out
of
hearing
the
man
read
the
manuscript
before
committing
the
act
which
rightly
or
wrongly
i
have
resolved
on
and
appearing
before
my
maker
for
judgment
i
james
r
colston
deem
it
my
duty
as
a
journalist
to
make
a
statement
to
the
public
my
name
is
i
believe
tolerably
well
known
to
the
people
as
a
writer
of
tragic
tales
but
the
somberest
imagination
never
conceived
anything
so
tragic
as
my
own
life
and
history
not
in
incident
my
life
has
been
destitute
of
adventure
and
action
but
my
mental
career
has
been
lurid
with
experiences
such
as
kill
and
damn
i
shall
not
recount
them
here--some
of
them
are
written
and
ready
for
publication
elsewhere
the
object
of
these
lines
is
to
explain
to
whomsoever
may
be
interested
that
my
death
is
voluntary--my
own
act
i
shall
die
at
twelve
o'clock
on
the
night
of
the
15th
of
july--a
significant
anniversary
to
me
for
it
was
on
that
day
and
at
that
hour
that
my
friend
in
time
and
eternity
charles
breede
performed
his
vow
to
me
by
the
same
act
which
his
fidelity
to
our
pledge
now
entails
upon
me
he
took
his
life
in
his
little
house
in
the
copeton
woods
there
was
the
customary
verdict
of
'temporary
insanity'
had
i
testified
at
that
inquest--had
i
told
all
i
knew
they
would
have
called
me
mad
here
followed
an
evidently
long
passage
which
the
man
reading
read
to
himself
only
the
rest
he
read
aloud
i
have
still
a
week
of
life
in
which
to
arrange
my
worldly
affairs
and
prepare
for
the
great
change
it
is
enough
for
i
have
but
few
affairs
and
it
is
now
four
years
since
death
became
an
imperative
obligation
i
shall
bear
this
writing
on
my
body
the
finder
will
please
hand
it
to
the
coroner
james
r
colston
ps--willard
marsh
on
this
the
fatal
fifteenth
day
of
july
i
hand
you
this
manuscript
to
be
opened
and
read
under
the
conditions
agreed
upon
and
at
the
place
which
i
designated
i
forego
my
intention
to
keep
it
on
my
body
to
explain
the
manner
of
my
death
which
is
not
important
it
will
serve
to
explain
the
manner
of
yours
i
am
to
call
for
you
during
the
night
to
receive
assurance
that
you
have
read
the
manuscript
you
know
me
well
enough
to
expect
me
but
my
friend
it
will
be
after
twelve
o'clock
may
god
have
mercy
on
our
souls
jrc
before
the
man
who
was
reading
this
manuscript
had
finished
the
candle
had
been
picked
up
and
lighted
when
the
reader
had
done
he
quietly
thrust
the
paper
against
the
flame
and
despite
the
protestations
of
the
others
held
it
until
it
was
burnt
to
ashes
the
man
who
did
this
and
who
afterward
placidly
endured
a
severe
reprimand
from
the
coroner
was
a
son-in-law
of
the
late
charles
breede
at
the
inquest
nothing
could
elicit
an
intelligent
account
of
what
the
paper
had
contained
from
the
times
yesterday
the
commissioners
of
lunacy
committed
to
the
asylum
mr
james
r
colston
a
writer
of
some
local
reputation
connected
with
the
messenger
it
will
be
remembered
that
on
the
evening
of
the
15th
inst
mr
colston
was
given
into
custody
by
one
of
his
fellow-lodgers
in
the
baine
house
who
had
observed
him
acting
very
suspiciously
baring
his
throat
and
whetting
a
razor--occasionally
trying
its
edge
by
actually
cutting
through
the
skin
of
his
arm
etc
on
being
handed
over
to
the
police
the
unfortunate
man
made
a
desperate
resistance
and
has
ever
since
been
so
violent
that
it
has
been
necessary
to
keep
him
in
a
strait-jacket
most
of
our
esteemed
contemporary's
other
writers
are
still
at
large
the
boarded
window
in
1830
only
a
few
miles
away
from
what
is
now
the
great
city
of
cincinnati
lay
an
immense
and
almost
unbroken
forest
the
whole
region
was
sparsely
settled
by
people
of
the
frontier--restless
souls
who
no
sooner
had
hewn
fairly
habitable
homes
out
of
the
wilderness
and
attained
to
that
degree
of
prosperity
which
to-day
we
should
call
indigence
than
impelled
by
some
mysterious
impulse
of
their
nature
they
abandoned
all
and
pushed
farther
westward
to
encounter
new
perils
and
privations
in
the
effort
to
regain
the
meagre
comforts
which
they
had
voluntarily
renounced
many
of
them
had
already
forsaken
that
region
for
the
remoter
settlements
but
among
those
remaining
was
one
who
had
been
of
those
first
arriving
he
lived
alone
in
a
house
of
logs
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
great
forest
of
whose
gloom
and
silence
he
seemed
a
part
for
no
one
had
ever
known
him
to
smile
nor
speak
a
needless
word
his
simple
wants
were
supplied
by
the
sale
or
barter
of
skins
of
wild
animals
in
the
river
town
for
not
a
thing
did
he
grow
upon
the
land
which
if
needful
he
might
have
claimed
by
right
of
undisturbed
possession
there
were
evidences
of
improvement--a
few
acres
of
ground
immediately
about
the
house
had
once
been
cleared
of
its
trees
the
decayed
stumps
of
which
were
half
concealed
by
the
new
growth
that
had
been
suffered
to
repair
the
ravage
wrought
by
the
ax
apparently
the
man's
zeal
for
agriculture
had
burned
with
a
failing
flame
expiring
in
penitential
ashes
the
little
log
house
with
its
chimney
of
sticks
its
roof
of
warping
clapboards
weighted
with
traversing
poles
and
its
chinking
of
clay
had
a
single
door
and
directly
opposite
a
window
the
latter
however
was
boarded
up--nobody
could
remember
a
time
when
it
was
not
and
none
knew
why
it
was
so
closed
certainly
not
because
of
the
occupant's
dislike
of
light
and
air
for
on
those
rare
occasions
when
a
hunter
had
passed
that
lonely
spot
the
recluse
had
commonly
been
seen
sunning
himself
on
his
doorstep
if
heaven
had
provided
sunshine
for
his
need
i
fancy
there
are
few
persons
living
to-day
who
ever
knew
the
secret
of
that
window
but
i
am
one
as
you
shall
see
the
man's
name
was
said
to
be
murlock
he
was
apparently
seventy
years
old
actually
about
fifty
something
besides
years
had
had
a
hand
in
his
aging
his
hair
and
long
full
beard
were
white
his
gray
lustreless
eyes
sunken
his
face
singularly
seamed
with
wrinkles
which
appeared
to
belong
to
two
intersecting
systems
in
figure
he
was
tall
and
spare
with
a
stoop
of
the
shoulders--a
burden
bearer
i
never
saw
him
these
particulars
i
learned
from
my
grandfather
from
whom
also
i
got
the
man's
story
when
i
was
a
lad
he
had
known
him
when
living
near
by
in
that
early
day
one
day
murlock
was
found
in
his
cabin
dead
it
was
not
a
time
and
place
for
coroners
and
newspapers
and
i
suppose
it
was
agreed
that
he
had
died
from
natural
causes
or
i
should
have
been
told
and
should
remember
i
know
only
that
with
what
was
probably
a
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
the
body
was
buried
near
the
cabin
alongside
the
grave
of
his
wife
who
had
preceded
him
by
so
many
years
that
local
tradition
had
retained
hardly
a
hint
of
her
existence
that
closes
the
final
chapter
of
this
true
story--excepting
indeed
the
circumstance
that
many
years
afterward
in
company
with
an
equally
intrepid
spirit
i
penetrated
to
the
place
and
ventured
near
enough
to
the
ruined
cabin
to
throw
a
stone
against
it
and
ran
away
to
avoid
the
ghost
which
every
well-informed
boy
thereabout
knew
haunted
the
spot
but
there
is
an
earlier
chapter--
that
supplied
by
my
grandfather
when
murlock
built
his
cabin
and
began
laying
sturdily
about
with
his
ax
to
hew
out
a
farm--the
rifle
meanwhile
his
means
of
support--he
was
young
strong
and
full
of
hope
in
that
eastern
country
whence
he
came
he
had
married
as
was
the
fashion
a
young
woman
in
all
ways
worthy
of
his
honest
devotion
who
shared
the
dangers
and
privations
of
his
lot
with
a
willing
spirit
and
light
heart
there
is
no
known
record
of
her
name
of
her
charms
of
mind
and
person
tradition
is
silent
and
the
doubter
is
at
liberty
to
entertain
his
doubt
but
god
forbid
that
i
should
share
it
of
their
affection
and
happiness
there
is
abundant
assurance
in
every
added
day
of
the
man's
widowed
life
for
what
but
the
magnetism
of
a
blessed
memory
could
have
chained
that
venturesome
spirit
to
a
lot
like
that
one
day
murlock
returned
from
gunning
in
a
distant
part
of
the
forest
to
find
his
wife
prostrate
with
fever
and
delirious
there
was
no
physician
within
miles
no
neighbor
nor
was
she
in
a
condition
to
be
left
to
summon
help
so
he
set
about
the
task
of
nursing
her
back
to
health
but
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
she
fell
into
unconsciousness
and
so
passed
away
apparently
with
never
a
gleam
of
returning
reason
from
what
we
know
of
a
nature
like
his
we
may
venture
to
sketch
in
some
of
the
details
of
the
outline
picture
drawn
by
my
grandfather
when
convinced
that
she
was
dead
murlock
had
sense
enough
to
remember
that
the
dead
must
be
prepared
for
burial
in
performance
of
this
sacred
duty
he
blundered
now
and
again
did
certain
things
incorrectly
and
others
which
he
did
correctly
were
done
over
and
over
his
occasional
failures
to
accomplish
some
simple
and
ordinary
act
filled
him
with
astonishment
like
that
of
a
drunken
man
who
wonders
at
the
suspension
of
familiar
natural
laws
he
was
surprised
too
that
he
did
not
weep--surprised
and
a
little
ashamed
surely
it
is
unkind
not
to
weep
for
the
dead
to-morrow
he
said
aloud
i
shall
have
to
make
the
coffin
and
dig
the
grave
and
then
i
shall
miss
her
when
she
is
no
longer
in
sight
but
now--she
is
dead
of
course
but
it
is
all
right--it
must
be
all
right
somehow
things
cannot
be
so
bad
as
they
seem
he
stood
over
the
body
in
the
fading
light
adjusting
the
hair
and
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
the
simple
toilet
doing
all
mechanically
with
soulless
care
and
still
through
his
consciousness
ran
an
undersense
of
conviction
that
all
was
right--that
he
should
have
her
again
as
before
and
everything
explained
he
had
had
no
experience
in
grief
his
capacity
had
not
been
enlarged
by
use
his
heart
could
not
contain
it
all
nor
his
imagination
rightly
conceive
it
he
did
not
know
he
was
so
hard
struck
that
knowledge
would
come
later
and
never
go
grief
is
an
artist
of
powers
as
various
as
the
instruments
upon
which
he
plays
his
dirges
for
the
dead
evoking
from
some
the
sharpest
shrillest
notes
from
others
the
low
grave
chords
that
throb
recurrent
like
the
slow
beating
of
a
distant
drum
some
natures
it
startles
some
it
stupefies
to
one
it
comes
like
the
stroke
of
an
arrow
stinging
all
the
sensibilities
to
a
keener
life
to
another
as
the
blow
of
a
bludgeon
which
in
crushing
benumbs
we
may
conceive
murlock
to
have
been
that
way
affected
for
and
here
we
are
upon
surer
ground
than
that
of
conjecture
no
sooner
had
he
finished
his
pious
work
than
sinking
into
a
chair
by
the
side
of
the
table
upon
which
the
body
lay
and
noting
how
white
the
profile
showed
in
the
deepening
gloom
he
laid
his
arms
upon
the
table's
edge
and
dropped
his
face
into
them
tearless
yet
and
unutterably
weary
at
that
moment
came
in
through
the
open
window
a
long
wailing
sound
like
the
cry
of
a
lost
child
in
the
far
deeps
of
the
darkening
wood
but
the
man
did
not
move
again
and
nearer
than
before
sounded
that
unearthly
cry
upon
his
failing
sense
perhaps
it
was
a
wild
beast
perhaps
it
was
a
dream
for
murlock
was
asleep
some
hours
later
as
it
afterward
appeared
this
unfaithful
watcher
awoke
and
lifting
his
head
from
his
arms
intently
listened--he
knew
not
why
there
in
the
black
darkness
by
the
side
of
the
dead
recalling
all
without
a
shock
he
strained
his
eyes
to
see--he
knew
not
what
his
senses
were
all
alert
his
breath
was
suspended
his
blood
had
stilled
its
tides
as
if
to
assist
the
silence
who--what
had
waked
him
and
where
was
it
suddenly
the
table
shook
beneath
his
arms
and
at
the
same
moment
he
heard
or
fancied
that
he
heard
a
light
soft
step--another--sounds
as
of
bare
feet
upon
the
floor
he
was
terrified
beyond
the
power
to
cry
out
or
move
perforce
he
waited--waited
there
in
the
darkness
through
seeming
centuries
of
such
dread
as
one
may
know
yet
live
to
tell
he
tried
vainly
to
speak
the
dead
woman's
name
vainly
to
stretch
forth
his
hand
across
the
table
to
learn
if
she
were
there
his
throat
was
powerless
his
arms
and
hands
were
like
lead
then
occurred
something
most
frightful
some
heavy
body
seemed
hurled
against
the
table
with
an
impetus
that
pushed
it
against
his
breast
so
sharply
as
nearly
to
overthrow
him
and
at
the
same
instant
he
heard
and
felt
the
fall
of
something
upon
the
floor
with
so
violent
a
thump
that
the
whole
house
was
shaken
by
the
impact
a
scuffling
ensued
and
a
confusion
of
sounds
impossible
to
describe
murlock
had
risen
to
his
feet
fear
had
by
excess
forfeited
control
of
his
faculties
he
flung
his
hands
upon
the
table
nothing
was
there
there
is
a
point
at
which
terror
may
turn
to
madness
and
madness
incites
to
action
with
no
definite
intent
from
no
motive
but
the
wayward
impulse
of
a
madman
murlock
sprang
to
the
wall
with
a
little
groping
seized
his
loaded
rifle
and
without
aim
discharged
it
by
the
flash
which
lit
up
the
room
with
a
vivid
illumination
he
saw
an
enormous
panther
dragging
the
dead
woman
toward
the
window
its
teeth
fixed
in
her
throat
then
there
were
darkness
blacker
than
before
and
silence
and
when
he
returned
to
consciousness
the
sun
was
high
and
the
wood
vocal
with
songs
of
birds
the
body
lay
near
the
window
where
the
beast
had
left
it
when
frightened
away
by
the
flash
and
report
of
the
rifle
the
clothing
was
deranged
the
long
hair
in
disorder
the
limbs
lay
anyhow
from
the
throat
dreadfully
lacerated
had
issued
a
pool
of
blood
not
yet
entirely
coagulated
the
ribbon
with
which
he
had
bound
the
wrists
was
broken
the
hands
were
tightly
clenched
between
the
teeth
was
a
fragment
of
the
animal's
ear

lady

i
find
myself
more
and
more
interested
in
him
it
is
not
i
am
sure
his--do
you
know
any
good
noun
corresponding
to
the
adjective
handsome
one
does
not
like
to
say
beauty
when
speaking
of
a
man
he
is
beautiful
enough
heaven
knows
i
should
not
even
care
to
trust
you
with
him--faithfulest
of
all
possible
wives
that
you
are--when
he
looks
his
best
as
he
always
does
nor
do
i
think
the
fascination
of
his
manner
has
much
to
do
with
it
you
recollect
that
the
charm
of
art
inheres
in
that
which
is
undefinable
and
to
you
and
me
my
dear
irene
i
fancy
there
is
rather
less
of
that
in
the
branch
of
art
under
consideration
than
to
girls
in
their
first
season
i
fancy
i
know
how
my
fine
gentleman
produces
many
of
his
effects
and
could
perhaps
give
him
a
pointer
on
heightening
them
nevertheless
his
manner
is
something
truly
delightful
i
suppose
what
interests
me
chiefly
is
the
man's
brains
his
conversation
is
the
best
i
have
ever
heard
and
altogether
unlike
any
one
else's
he
seems
to
know
everything
as
indeed
he
ought
for
he
has
been
everywhere
read
everything
seen
all
there
is
to
see--sometimes
i
think
rather
more
than
is
good
for
him--and
had
acquaintance
with
the
queerest
people
and
then
his
voice--irene
when
i
hear
it
i
actually
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
have
paid
at
the
door
though
of
course
it
is
my
own
door
july

i
fear
my
remarks
about
dr
barritz
must
have
been
being
thoughtless
very
silly
or
you
would
not
have
written
of
him
with
such
levity
not
to
say
disrespect
believe
me
dearest
he
has
more
dignity
and
seriousness
of
the
kind
i
mean
which
is
not
inconsistent
with
a
manner
sometimes
playful
and
always
charming
than
any
of
the
men
that
you
and
i
ever
met
and
young
raynor--you
knew
raynor
at
monterey--tells
me
that
the
men
all
like
him
and
that
he
is
treated
with
something
like
deference
everywhere
there
is
a
mystery
too--something
about
his
connection
with
the
blavatsky
people
in
northern
india
raynor
either
would
not
or
could
not
tell
me
the
particulars
i
infer
that
dr
barritz
is
thought--don't
you
dare
to
laugh--a
magician
could
anything
be
finer
than
that
an
ordinary
mystery
is
not
of
course
so
good
as
a
scandal
but
when
it
relates
to
dark
and
dreadful
practices--to
the
exercise
of
unearthly
powers--could
anything
be
more
piquant
it
explains
too
the
singular
influence
the
man
has
upon
me
it
is
the
undefinable
in
his
art--black
art
seriously
dear
i
quite
tremble
when
he
looks
me
full
in
the
eyes
with
those
unfathomable
orbs
of
his
which
i
have
already
vainly
attempted
to
describe
to
you
how
dreadful
if
he
has
the
power
to
make
one
fall
in
love
do
you
know
if
the
blavatsky
crowd
have
that
power--

the
strangest
thing
last
evening
while
auntie
was
attending
one
of
the
hotel
hops
i
hate
them
dr
barritz
called
it
was
scandalously
late--i
actually
believe
that
he
had
talked
with
auntie
in
the
ballroom
and
learned
from
her
that
i
was
alone
i
had
been
all
the
evening
contriving
how
to
worm
out
of
him
the
truth
about
his
connection
with
the
thugs
in
sepoy
and
all
of
that
black
business
but
the
moment
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
me
for
i
admitted
him
i'm
ashamed
to
say
i
was
helpless
i
trembled
i
blushed
i--o
irene
irene
i
love
the
man
beyond
expression
and
you
know
how
it
is
yourself
fancy
i
an
ugly
duckling
from
redhorse--daughter
they
say
of
old
calamity
jim--certainly
his
heiress
with
no
living
relation
but
an
absurd
old
aunt
who
spoils
me
a
thousand
and
fifty
ways--absolutely
destitute
of
everything
but
a
million
dollars
and
a
hope
in
paris--i
daring
to
love
a
god
like
him
my
dear
if
i
had
you
here
i
could
tear
your
hair
out
with
mortification
i
am
convinced
that
he
is
aware
of
my
feeling
for
he
stayed
but
a
few
moments
said
nothing
but
what
another
man
might
have
said
half
as
well
and
pretending
that
he
had
an
engagement
went
away
i
learned
to-day
a
little
bird
told
me--the
bell-bird
that
he
went
straight
to
bed
how
does
that
strike
you
as
evidence
of
exemplary
habits
july

that
little
wretch
raynor
called
yesterday
and
his
babble
set
me
almost
wild
he
never
runs
down--that
is
to
say
when
he
exterminates
a
score
of
reputations
more
or
less
he
does
not
pause
between
one
reputation
and
the
next
by
the
way
he
inquired
about
you
and
his
manifestations
of
interest
in
you
had
i
confess
a
good
deal
of
vraisemblance
mr
raynor
observes
no
game
laws
like
death
which
he
would
inflict
if
slander
were
fatal
he
has
all
seasons
for
his
own
but
i
like
him
for
we
knew
each
other
at
redhorse
when
we
were
young
he
was
known
in
those
days
as
giggles
and
i--o
irene
can
you
ever
forgive
me--i
was
called
gunny
god
knows
why
perhaps
in
allusion
to
the
material
of
my
pinafores
perhaps
because
the
name
is
in
alliteration
with
giggles
for
gig
and
i
were
inseparable
playmates
and
the
miners
may
have
thought
it
a
delicate
civility
to
recognize
some
kind
of
relationship
between
us
later
we
took
in
a
third--another
of
adversity's
brood
who
like
garrick
between
tragedy
and
comedy
had
a
chronic
inability
to
adjudicate
the
rival
claims
of
frost
and
famine
between
him
and
misery
there
was
seldom
anything
more
than
a
single
suspender
and
the
hope
of
a
meal
which
would
at
the
same
time
support
life
and
make
it
insupportable
he
literally
picked
up
a
precarious
living
for
himself
and
an
aged
mother
by
chloriding
the
dumps
that
is
to
say
the
miners
permitted
him
to
search
the
heaps
of
waste
rock
for
such
pieces
of
pay
ore
as
had
been
overlooked
and
these
he
sacked
up
and
sold
at
the
syndicate
mill
he
became
a
member
of
our
firm--gunny
giggles
and
dumps
thenceforth--through
my
favor
for
i
could
not
then
nor
can
i
now
be
indifferent
to
his
courage
and
prowess
in
defending
against
giggles
the
immemorial
right
of
his
sex
to
insult
a
strange
and
unprotected
female--myself
after
old
jim
struck
it
in
the
calamity
and
i
began
to
wear
shoes
and
go
to
school
and
in
emulation
giggles
took
to
washing
his
face
and
became
jack
raynor
of
wells
fargo

co
and
old
mrs
barts
was
herself
chlorided
to
her
fathers
dumps
drifted
over
to
san
juan
smith
and
turned
stage
driver
and
was
killed
by
road
agents
and
so
forth
why
do
i
tell
you
all
this
dear
because
it
is
heavy
on
my
heart
because
i
walk
the
valley
of
humility
because
i
am
subduing
myself
to
permanent
consciousness
of
my
unworthiness
to
unloose
the
latchet
of
dr
barritz's
shoe
because
oh
dear
oh
dear
there's
a
cousin
of
dumps
at
this
hotel
i
haven't
spoken
to
him
i
never
had
much
acquaintance
with
him--but
do
you
suppose
he
has
recognized
me
do
please
give
me
in
your
next
your
candid
sure-enough
opinion
about
it
and
say
you
don't
think
so
do
you
suppose
he
knows
about
me
already
and
that
that
is
why
he
left
me
last
evening
when
he
saw
that
i
blushed
and
trembled
like
a
fool
under
his
eyes
you
know
i
can't
bribe
all
the
newspapers
and
i
can't
go
back
on
anybody
who
was
civil
to
gunny
at
redhorse--not
if
i'm
pitched
out
of
society
into
the
sea
so
the
skeleton
sometimes
rattles
behind
the
door
i
never
cared
much
before
as
you
know
but
now--now
it
is
not
the
same
jack
raynor
i
am
sure
of--he
will
not
tell
him
he
seems
indeed
to
hold
him
in
such
respect
as
hardly
to
dare
speak
to
him
at
all
and
i'm
a
good
deal
that
way
myself
dear
dear
i
wish
i
had
something
besides
a
million
dollars
if
jack
were
three
inches
taller
i'd
marry
him
alive
and
go
back
to
redhorse
and
wear
sackcloth
again
to
the
end
of
my
miserable
days
july
25
we
had
a
perfectly
splendid
sunset
last
evening
and
i
must
tell
you
all
about
it
i
ran
away
from
auntie
and
everybody
and
was
walking
alone
on
the
beach
i
expect
you
to
believe
you
infidel
that
i
had
not
looked
out
of
my
window
on
the
seaward
side
of
the
hotel
and
seen
him
walking
alone
on
the
beach
if
you
are
not
lost
to
every
feeling
of
womanly
delicacy
you
will
accept
my
statement
without
question
i
soon
established
myself
under
my
sunshade
and
had
for
some
time
been
gazing
out
dreamily
over
the
sea
when
he
approached
walking
close
to
the
edge
of
the
water--it
was
ebb
tide
i
assure
you
the
wet
sand
actually
brightened
about
his
feet
as
he
approached
me
he
lifted
his
hat
saying
miss
dement
may
i
sit
with
you--or
will
you
walk
with
me
the
possibility
that
neither
might
be
agreeable
seems
not
to
have
occurred
to
him
did
you
ever
know
such
assurance
assurance
my
dear
it
was
gall
downright
gall
well
i
didn't
find
it
wormwood
and
replied
with
my
untutored
redhorse
heart
in
my
throat
i--i
shall
be
pleased
to
do
anything
could
words
have
been
more
stupid
there
are
depths
of
fatuity
in
me
friend
o'
my
soul
that
are
simply
bottomless
he
extended
his
hand
smiling
and
i
delivered
mine
into
it
without
a
moment's
hesitation
and
when
his
fingers
closed
about
it
to
assist
me
to
my
feet
the
consciousness
that
it
trembled
made
me
blush
worse
than
the
red
west
i
got
up
however
and
after
a
while
observing
that
he
had
not
let
go
my
hand
i
pulled
on
it
a
little
but
unsuccessfully
he
simply
held
on
saying
nothing
but
looking
down
into
my
face
with
some
kind
of
smile--i
didn't
know--how
could
i--whether
it
was
affectionate
derisive
or
what
for
i
did
not
look
at
him
how
beautiful
he
was--
with
the
red
fires
of
the
sunset
burning
in
the
depths
of
his
eyes
do
you
know
dear
if
the
thugs
and
experts
of
the
blavatsky
region
have
any
special
kind
of
eyes
ah
you
should
have
seen
his
superb
attitude
the
god-like
inclination
of
his
head
as
he
stood
over
me
after
i
had
got
upon
my
feet
it
was
a
noble
picture
but
i
soon
destroyed
it
for
i
began
at
once
to
sink
again
to
the
earth
there
was
only
one
thing
for
him
to
do
and
he
did
it
he
supported
me
with
an
arm
about
my
waist
miss
dement
are
you
ill
he
said
it
was
not
an
exclamation
there
was
neither
alarm
nor
solicitude
in
it
if
he
had
added
i
suppose
that
is
about
what
i
am
expected
to
say
he
would
hardly
have
expressed
his
sense
of
the
situation
more
clearly
his
manner
filled
me
with
shame
and
indignation
for
i
was
suffering
acutely
i
wrenched
my
hand
out
of
his
grasped
the
arm
supporting
me
and
pushing
myself
free
fell
plump
into
the
sand
and
sat
helpless
my
hat
had
fallen
off
in
the
struggle
and
my
hair
tumbled
about
my
face
and
shoulders
in
the
most
mortifying
way
go
away
from
me
i
cried
half
choking
o
please
go
away
you--you
thug
how
dare
you
think
that
when
my
leg
is
asleep
i
actually
said
those
identical
words
and
then
i
broke
down
and
sobbed
irene
i
blubbered
his
manner
altered
in
an
instant--i
could
see
that
much
through
my
fingers
and
hair
he
dropped
on
one
knee
beside
me
parted
the
tangle
of
hair
and
said
in
the
tenderest
way
my
poor
girl
god
knows
i
have
not
intended
to
pain
you
how
should
i--i
who
love
you--i
who
have
loved
you
for--for
years
and
years
he
had
pulled
my
wet
hands
away
from
my
face
and
was
covering
them
with
kisses
my
cheeks
were
like
two
coals
my
whole
face
was
flaming
and
i
think
steaming
what
could
i
do
i
hid
it
on
his
shoulder--there
was
no
other
place
and
o
my
dear
friend
how
my
leg
tingled
and
thrilled
and
how
i
wanted
to
kick
we
sat
so
for
a
long
time
he
had
released
one
of
my
hands
to
pass
his
arm
about
me
again
and
i
possessed
myself
of
my
handkerchief
and
was
drying
my
eyes
and
my
nose
i
would
not
look
up
until
that
was
done
he
tried
in
vain
to
push
me
a
little
away
and
gaze
into
my
face
presently
when
all
was
right
and
it
had
grown
a
bit
dark
i
lifted
my
head
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
and
smiled
my
best--my
level
best
dear
what
do
you
mean
i
said
by
'years
and
years'
dearest
he
replied
very
gravely
very
earnestly
in
the
absence
of
the
sunken
cheeks
the
hollow
eyes
the
lank
hair
the
slouching
gait
the
rags
dirt
and
youth
can
you
not--will
you
not
understand
gunny
i'm
dumps
in
a
moment
i
was
upon
my
feet
and
he
upon
his
i
seized
him
by
the
lapels
of
his
coat
and
peered
into
his
handsome
face
in
the
deepening
darkness
i
was
breathless
with
excitement
and
you
are
not
dead
i
asked
hardly
knowing
what
i
said
only
dead
in
love
dear
i
recovered
from
the
road
agent's
bullet
but
this
i
fear
is
fatal
but
about
jack--mr
raynor
don't
you
know--
i
am
ashamed
to
say
darling
that
it
was
through
that
unworthy
person's
suggestion
that
i
came
here
from
vienna
irene
they
have
roped
in
your
affectionate
friend
mary
jane
dement
ps--the
worst
of
it
is
that
there
is
no
mystery
that
was
the
invention
of
jack
raynor
to
arouse
my
curiosity
james
is
not
a
thug
he
solemnly
assures
me
that
in
all
his
wanderings
he
has
never
set
foot
in
sepoy
the
eyes
of
the
panther
i
one
does
not
always
marry
when
insane
a
man
and
a
woman--nature
had
done
the
grouping--sat
on
a
rustic
seat
in
the
late
afternoon
the
man
was
middle-aged
slender
swarthy
with
the
expression
of
a
poet
and
the
complexion
of
a
pirate--a
man
at
whom
one
would
look
again
the
woman
was
young
blonde
graceful
with
something
in
her
figure
and
movements
suggesting
the
word
lithe
she
was
habited
in
a
gray
gown
with
odd
brown
markings
in
the
texture
she
may
have
been
beautiful
one
could
not
readily
say
for
her
eyes
denied
attention
to
all
else
they
were
gray-green
long
and
narrow
with
an
expression
defying
analysis
one
could
only
know
that
they
were
disquieting
cleopatra
may
have
had
such
eyes
the
man
and
the
woman
talked
yes
said
the
woman
i
love
you
god
knows
but
marry
you
no
i
cannot
will
not
irene
you
have
said
that
many
times
yet
always
have
denied
me
a
reason
i've
a
right
to
know
to
understand
to
feel
and
prove
my
fortitude
if
i
have
it
give
me
a
reason
for
loving
you
the
woman
was
smiling
through
her
tears
and
her
pallor
that
did
not
stir
any
sense
of
humor
in
the
man
no
there
is
no
reason
for
that
a
reason
for
not
marrying
me
i've
a
right
to
know
i
must
know
i
will
know
he
had
risen
and
was
standing
before
her
with
clenched
hands
on
his
face
a
frown--it
might
have
been
called
a
scowl
he
looked
as
if
he
might
attempt
to
learn
by
strangling
her
she
smiled
no
more--merely
sat
looking
up
into
his
face
with
a
fixed
set
regard
that
was
utterly
without
emotion
or
sentiment
yet
it
had
something
in
it
that
tamed
his
resentment
and
made
him
shiver
you
are
determined
to
have
my
reason
she
asked
in
a
tone
that
was
entirely
mechanical--a
tone
that
might
have
been
her
look
made
audible
if
you
please--if
i'm
not
asking
too
much
apparently
this
lord
of
creation
was
yielding
some
part
of
his
dominion
over
his
co-creature
very
well
you
shall
know
i
am
insane
the
man
started
then
looked
incredulous
and
was
conscious
that
he
ought
to
be
amused
but
again
the
sense
of
humor
failed
him
in
his
need
and
despite
his
disbelief
he
was
profoundly
disturbed
by
that
which
he
did
not
believe
between
our
convictions
and
our
feelings
there
is
no
good
understanding
that
is
what
the
physicians
would
say
the
woman
continued--if
they
knew
i
might
myself
prefer
to
call
it
a
case
of
'possession'
sit
down
and
hear
what
i
have
to
say
the
man
silently
resumed
his
seat
beside
her
on
the
rustic
bench
by
the
wayside
over-against
them
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
valley
the
hills
were
already
sunset-flushed
and
the
stillness
all
about
was
of
that
peculiar
quality
that
foretells
the
twilight
something
of
its
mysterious
and
significant
solemnity
had
imparted
itself
to
the
man's
mood
in
the
spiritual
as
in
the
material
world
are
signs
and
presages
of
night
rarely
meeting
her
look
and
whenever
he
did
so
conscious
of
the
indefinable
dread
with
which
despite
their
feline
beauty
her
eyes
always
affected
him
jenner
brading
listened
in
silence
to
the
story
told
by
irene
marlowe
in
deference
to
the
reader's
possible
prejudice
against
the
artless
method
of
an
unpractised
historian
the
author
ventures
to
substitute
his
own
version
for
hers
ii
a
room
may
be
too
narrow
for
three
though
one
is
outside
in
a
little
log
house
containing
a
single
room
sparely
and
rudely
furnished
crouching
on
the
floor
against
one
of
the
walls
was
a
woman
clasping
to
her
breast
a
child
outside
a
dense
unbroken
forest
extended
for
many
miles
in
every
direction
this
was
at
night
and
the
room
was
black
dark
no
human
eye
could
have
discerned
the
woman
and
the
child
yet
they
were
observed
narrowly
vigilantly
with
never
even
a
momentary
slackening
of
attention
and
that
is
the
pivotal
fact
upon
which
this
narrative
turns
charles
marlowe
was
of
the
class
now
extinct
in
this
country
of
woodmen
pioneers--men
who
found
their
most
acceptable
surroundings
in
sylvan
solitudes
that
stretched
along
the
eastern
slope
of
the
mississippi
valley
from
the
great
lakes
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
these
men
pushed
ever
westward
generation
after
generation
with
rifle
and
ax
reclaiming
from
nature
and
her
savage
children
here
and
there
an
isolated
acreage
for
the
plow
no
sooner
reclaimed
than
surrendered
to
their
less
venturesome
but
more
thrifty
successors
at
last
they
burst
through
the
edge
of
the
forest
into
the
open
country
and
vanished
as
if
they
had
fallen
over
a
cliff
the
woodman
pioneer
is
no
more
the
pioneer
of
the
plains--he
whose
easy
task
it
was
to
subdue
for
occupancy
two-thirds
of
the
country
in
a
single
generation--is
another
and
inferior
creation
with
charles
marlowe
in
the
wilderness
sharing
the
dangers
hardships
and
privations
of
that
strange
unprofitable
life
were
his
wife
and
child
to
whom
in
the
manner
of
his
class
in
which
the
domestic
virtues
were
a
religion
he
was
passionately
attached
the
woman
was
still
young
enough
to
be
comely
new
enough
to
the
awful
isolation
of
her
lot
to
be
cheerful
by
withholding
the
large
capacity
for
happiness
which
the
simple
satisfactions
of
the
forest
life
could
not
have
filled
heaven
had
dealt
honorably
with
her
in
her
light
household
tasks
her
child
her
husband
and
her
few
foolish
books
she
found
abundant
provision
for
her
needs
one
morning
in
midsummer
marlowe
took
down
his
rifle
from
the
wooden
hooks
on
the
wall
and
signified
his
intention
of
getting
game
we've
meat
enough
said
the
wife
please
don't
go
out
to-day
i
dreamed
last
night
o
such
a
dreadful
thing
i
cannot
recollect
it
but
i'm
almost
sure
that
it
will
come
to
pass
if
you
go
out
it
is
painful
to
confess
that
marlowe
received
this
solemn
statement
with
less
of
gravity
than
was
due
to
the
mysterious
nature
of
the
calamity
foreshadowed
in
truth
he
laughed
try
to
remember
he
said
maybe
you
dreamed
that
baby
had
lost
the
power
of
speech
the
conjecture
was
obviously
suggested
by
the
fact
that
baby
clinging
to
the
fringe
of
his
hunting-coat
with
all
her
ten
pudgy
thumbs
was
at
that
moment
uttering
her
sense
of
the
situation
in
a
series
of
exultant
goo-goos
inspired
by
sight
of
her
father's
raccoon-skin
cap
the
woman
yielded
lacking
the
gift
of
humor
she
could
not
hold
out
against
his
kindly
badinage
so
with
a
kiss
for
the
mother
and
a
kiss
for
the
child
he
left
the
house
and
closed
the
door
upon
his
happiness
forever
at
nightfall
he
had
not
returned
the
woman
prepared
supper
and
waited
then
she
put
baby
to
bed
and
sang
softly
to
her
until
she
slept
by
this
time
the
fire
on
the
hearth
at
which
she
had
cooked
supper
had
burned
out
and
the
room
was
lighted
by
a
single
candle
this
she
afterward
placed
in
the
open
window
as
a
sign
and
welcome
to
the
hunter
if
he
should
approach
from
that
side
she
had
thoughtfully
closed
and
barred
the
door
against
such
wild
animals
as
might
prefer
it
to
an
open
window
--of
the
habits
of
beasts
of
prey
in
entering
a
house
uninvited
she
was
not
advised
though
with
true
female
prevision
she
may
have
considered
the
possibility
of
their
entrance
by
way
of
the
chimney
as
the
night
wore
on
she
became
not
less
anxious
but
more
drowsy
and
at
last
rested
her
arms
upon
the
bed
by
the
child
and
her
head
upon
the
arms
the
candle
in
the
window
burned
down
to
the
socket
sputtered
and
flared
a
moment
and
went
out
unobserved
for
the
woman
slept
and
dreamed
in
her
dreams
she
sat
beside
the
cradle
of
a
second
child
the
first
one
was
dead
the
father
was
dead
the
home
in
the
forest
was
lost
and
the
dwelling
in
which
she
lived
was
unfamiliar
there
were
heavy
oaken
doors
always
closed
and
outside
the
windows
fastened
into
the
thick
stone
walls
were
iron
bars
obviously
so
she
thought
a
provision
against
indians
all
this
she
noted
with
an
infinite
self-pity
but
without
surprise--an
emotion
unknown
in
dreams
the
child
in
the
cradle
was
invisible
under
its
coverlet
which
something
impelled
her
to
remove
she
did
so
disclosing
the
face
of
a
wild
animal
in
the
shock
of
this
dreadful
revelation
the
dreamer
awoke
trembling
in
the
darkness
of
her
cabin
in
the
wood
as
a
sense
of
her
actual
surroundings
came
slowly
back
to
her
she
felt
for
the
child
that
was
not
a
dream
and
assured
herself
by
its
breathing
that
all
was
well
with
it
nor
could
she
forbear
to
pass
a
hand
lightly
across
its
face
then
moved
by
some
impulse
for
which
she
probably
could
not
have
accounted
she
rose
and
took
the
sleeping
babe
in
her
arms
holding
it
close
against
her
breast
the
head
of
the
child's
cot
was
against
the
wall
to
which
the
woman
now
turned
her
back
as
she
stood
lifting
her
eyes
she
saw
two
bright
objects
starring
the
darkness
with
a
reddish-green
glow
she
took
them
to
be
two
coals
on
the
hearth
but
with
her
returning
sense
of
direction
came
the
disquieting
consciousness
that
they
were
not
in
that
quarter
of
the
room
moreover
were
too
high
being
nearly
at
the
level
of
the
eyes--of
her
own
eyes
for
these
were
the
eyes
of
a
panther
the
beast
was
at
the
open
window
directly
opposite
and
not
five
paces
away
nothing
but
those
terrible
eyes
was
visible
but
in
the
dreadful
tumult
of
her
feelings
as
the
situation
disclosed
itself
to
her
understanding
she
somehow
knew
that
the
animal
was
standing
on
its
hinder
feet
supporting
itself
with
its
paws
on
the
window-ledge
that
signified
a
malign
interest--not
the
mere
gratification
of
an
indolent
curiosity
the
consciousness
of
the
attitude
was
an
added
horror
accentuating
the
menace
of
those
awful
eyes
in
whose
steadfast
fire
her
strength
and
courage
were
alike
consumed
under
their
silent
questioning
she
shuddered
and
turned
sick
her
knees
failed
her
and
by
degrees
instinctively
striving
to
avoid
a
sudden
movement
that
might
bring
the
beast
upon
her
she
sank
to
the
floor
crouched
against
the
wall
and
tried
to
shield
the
babe
with
her
trembling
body
without
withdrawing
her
gaze
from
the
luminous
orbs
that
were
killing
her
no
thought
of
her
husband
came
to
her
in
her
agony--no
hope
nor
suggestion
of
rescue
or
escape
her
capacity
for
thought
and
feeling
had
narrowed
to
the
dimensions
of
a
single
emotion--fear
of
the
animal's
spring
of
the
impact
of
its
body
the
buffeting
of
its
great
arms
the
feel
of
its
teeth
in
her
throat
the
mangling
of
her
babe
motionless
now
and
in
absolute
silence
she
awaited
her
doom
the
moments
growing
to
hours
to
years
to
ages
and
still
those
devilish
eyes
maintained
their
watch
returning
to
his
cabin
late
at
night
with
a
deer
on
his
shoulders
charles
marlowe
tried
the
door
it
did
not
yield
he
knocked
there
was
no
answer
he
laid
down
his
deer
and
went
round
to
the
window
as
he
turned
the
angle
of
the
building
he
fancied
he
heard
a
sound
as
of
stealthy
footfalls
and
a
rustling
in
the
undergrowth
of
the
forest
but
they
were
too
slight
for
certainty
even
to
his
practised
ear
approaching
the
window
and
to
his
surprise
finding
it
open
he
threw
his
leg
over
the
sill
and
entered
all
was
darkness
and
silence
he
groped
his
way
to
the
fire-place
struck
a
match
and
lit
a
candle
then
he
looked
about
cowering
on
the
floor
against
a
wall
was
his
wife
clasping
his
child
as
he
sprang
toward
her
she
rose
and
broke
into
laughter
long
loud
and
mechanical
devoid
of
gladness
and
devoid
of
sense--the
laughter
that
is
not
out
of
keeping
with
the
clanking
of
a
chain
hardly
knowing
what
he
did
he
extended
his
arms
she
laid
the
babe
in
them
it
was
dead--pressed
to
death
in
its
mother's
embrace
iii
the
theory
of
the
defense
that
is
what
occurred
during
a
night
in
a
forest
but
not
all
of
it
did
irene
marlowe
relate
to
jenner
brading
not
all
of
it
was
known
to
her
when
she
had
concluded
the
sun
was
below
the
horizon
and
the
long
summer
twilight
had
begun
to
deepen
in
the
hollows
of
the
land
for
some
moments
brading
was
silent
expecting
the
narrative
to
be
carried
forward
to
some
definite
connection
with
the
conversation
introducing
it
but
the
narrator
was
as
silent
as
he
her
face
averted
her
hands
clasping
and
unclasping
themselves
as
they
lay
in
her
lap
with
a
singular
suggestion
of
an
activity
independent
of
her
will
it
is
a
sad
a
terrible
story
said
brading
at
last
but
i
do
not
understand
you
call
charles
marlowe
father
that
i
know
that
he
is
old
before
his
time
broken
by
some
great
sorrow
i
have
seen
or
thought
i
saw
but
pardon
me
you
said
that
you--that
you--
that
i
am
insane
said
the
girl
without
a
movement
of
head
or
body
but
irene
you
say--please
dear
do
not
look
away
from
me--you
say
that
the
child
was
dead
not
demented
yes
that
one--i
am
the
second
i
was
born
three
months
after
that
night
my
mother
being
mercifully
permitted
to
lay
down
her
life
in
giving
me
mine
brading
was
again
silent
he
was
a
trifle
dazed
and
could
not
at
once
think
of
the
right
thing
to
say
her
face
was
still
turned
away
in
his
embarrassment
he
reached
impulsively
toward
the
hands
that
lay
closing
and
unclosing
in
her
lap
but
something--he
could
not
have
said
what--
restrained
him
he
then
remembered
vaguely
that
he
had
never
altogether
cared
to
take
her
hand
is
it
likely
she
resumed
that
a
person
born
under
such
circumstances
is
like
others--is
what
you
call
sane
brading
did
not
reply
he
was
preoccupied
with
a
new
thought
that
was
taking
shape
in
his
mind--what
a
scientist
would
have
called
an
hypothesis
a
detective
a
theory
it
might
throw
an
added
light
albeit
a
lurid
one
upon
such
doubt
of
her
sanity
as
her
own
assertion
had
not
dispelled
the
country
was
still
new
and
outside
the
villages
sparsely
populated
the
professional
hunter
was
still
a
familiar
figure
and
among
his
trophies
were
heads
and
pelts
of
the
larger
kinds
of
game
tales
variously
credible
of
nocturnal
meetings
with
savage
animals
in
lonely
roads
were
sometimes
current
passed
through
the
customary
stages
of
growth
and
decay
and
were
forgotten
a
recent
addition
to
these
popular
apocrypha
originating
apparently
by
spontaneous
generation
in
several
households
was
of
a
panther
which
had
frightened
some
of
their
members
by
looking
in
at
windows
by
night
the
yarn
had
caused
its
little
ripple
of
excitement--had
even
attained
to
the
distinction
of
a
place
in
the
local
newspaper
but
brading
had
given
it
no
attention
its
likeness
to
the
story
to
which
he
had
just
listened
now
impressed
him
as
perhaps
more
than
accidental
was
it
not
possible
that
the
one
story
had
suggested
the
other--that
finding
congenial
conditions
in
a
morbid
mind
and
a
fertile
fancy
it
had
grown
to
the
tragic
tale
that
he
had
heard
brading
recalled
certain
circumstances
of
the
girl's
history
and
disposition
of
which
with
love's
incuriosity
he
had
hitherto
been
heedless--such
as
her
solitary
life
with
her
father
at
whose
house
no
one
apparently
was
an
acceptable
visitor
and
her
strange
fear
of
the
night
by
which
those
who
knew
her
best
accounted
for
her
never
being
seen
after
dark
surely
in
such
a
mind
imagination
once
kindled
might
burn
with
a
lawless
flame
penetrating
and
enveloping
the
entire
structure
that
she
was
mad
though
the
conviction
gave
him
the
acutest
pain
he
could
no
longer
doubt
she
had
only
mistaken
an
effect
of
her
mental
disorder
for
its
cause
bringing
into
imaginary
relation
with
her
own
personality
the
vagaries
of
the
local
myth-makers
with
some
vague
intention
of
testing
his
new
theory
and
no
very
definite
notion
of
how
to
set
about
it
he
said
gravely
but
with
hesitation
irene
dear
tell
me--i
beg
you
will
not
take
offence
but
tell
me--
i
have
told
you
she
interrupted
speaking
with
a
passionate
earnestness
that
he
had
not
known
her
to
show--i
have
already
told
you
that
we
cannot
marry
is
anything
else
worth
saying
before
he
could
stop
her
she
had
sprung
from
her
seat
and
without
another
word
or
look
was
gliding
away
among
the
trees
toward
her
father's
house
brading
had
risen
to
detain
her
he
stood
watching
her
in
silence
until
she
had
vanished
in
the
gloom
suddenly
he
started
as
if
he
had
been
shot
his
face
took
on
an
expression
of
amazement
and
alarm
in
one
of
the
black
shadows
into
which
she
had
disappeared
he
had
caught
a
quick
brief
glimpse
of
shining
eyes
for
an
instant
he
was
dazed
and
irresolute
then
he
dashed
into
the
wood
after
her
shouting
irene
irene
look
out
the
panther
the
panther
in
a
moment
he
had
passed
through
the
fringe
of
forest
into
open
ground
and
saw
the
girl's
gray
skirt
vanishing
into
her
father's
door
no
panther
was
visible
iv
an
appeal

conscience
of
god
jenner
brading
attorney-at-law
lived
in
a
cottage
at
the
edge
of
the
town
directly
behind
the
dwelling
was
the
forest
being
a
bachelor
and
therefore
by
the
draconian
moral
code
of
the
time
and
place
denied
the
services
of
the
only
species
of
domestic
servant
known
thereabout
the
hired
girl
he
boarded
at
the
village
hotel
where
also
was
his
office
the
woodside
cottage
was
merely
a
lodging
maintained--at
no
great
cost
to
be
sure--as
an
evidence
of
prosperity
and
respectability
it
would
hardly
do
for
one
to
whom
the
local
newspaper
had
pointed
with
pride
as
the
foremost
jurist
of
his
time
to
be
homeless
albeit
he
may
sometimes
have
suspected
that
the
words
home
and
house
were
not
strictly
synonymous
indeed
his
consciousness
of
the
disparity
and
his
will
to
harmonize
it
were
matters
of
logical
inference
for
it
was
generally
reported
that
soon
after
the
cottage
was
built
its
owner
had
made
a
futile
venture
in
the
direction
of
marriage--had
in
truth
gone
so
far
as
to
be
rejected
by
the
beautiful
but
eccentric
daughter
of
old
man
marlowe
the
recluse
this
was
publicly
believed
because
he
had
told
it
himself
and
she
had
not--a
reversal
of
the
usual
order
of
things
which
could
hardly
fail
to
carry
conviction
brading's
bedroom
was
at
the
rear
of
the
house
with
a
single
window
facing
the
forest
one
night
he
was
awakened
by
a
noise
at
that
window
he
could
hardly
have
said
what
it
was
like
with
a
little
thrill
of
the
nerves
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
laid
hold
of
the
revolver
which
with
a
forethought
most
commendable
in
one
addicted
to
the
habit
of
sleeping
on
the
ground
floor
with
an
open
window
he
had
put
under
his
pillow
the
room
was
in
absolute
darkness
but
being
unterrified
he
knew
where
to
direct
his
eyes
and
there
he
held
them
awaiting
in
silence
what
further
might
occur
he
could
now
dimly
discern
the
aperture--a
square
of
lighter
black
presently
there
appeared
at
its
lower
edge
two
gleaming
eyes
that
burned
with
a
malignant
lustre
inexpressibly
terrible
brading's
heart
gave
a
great
jump
then
seemed
to
stand
still
a
chill
passed
along
his
spine
and
through
his
hair
he
felt
the
blood
forsake
his
cheeks
he
could
not
have
cried
out--not
to
save
his
life
but
being
a
man
of
courage
he
would
not
to
save
his
life
have
done
so
if
he
had
been
able
some
trepidation
his
coward
body
might
feel
but
his
spirit
was
of
sterner
stuff
slowly
the
shining
eyes
rose
with
a
steady
motion
that
seemed
an
approach
and
slowly
rose
brading's
right
hand
holding
the
pistol
he
fired
blinded
by
the
flash
and
stunned
by
the
report
brading
nevertheless
heard
or
fancied
that
he
heard
the
wild
high
scream
of
the
panther
so
human
in
sound
so
devilish
in
suggestion
leaping
from
the
bed
he
hastily
clothed
himself
and
pistol
in
hand
sprang
from
the
door
meeting
two
or
three
men
who
came
running
up
from
the
road
a
brief
explanation
was
followed
by
a
cautious
search
of
the
house
the
grass
was
wet
with
dew
beneath
the
window
it
had
been
trodden
and
partly
leveled
for
a
wide
space
from
which
a
devious
trail
visible
in
the
light
of
a
lantern
led
away
into
the
bushes
one
of
the
men
stumbled
and
fell
upon
his
hands
which
as
he
rose
and
rubbed
them
together
were
slippery
on
examination
they
were
seen
to
be
red
with
blood
an
encounter
unarmed
with
a
wounded
panther
was
not
agreeable
to
their
taste
all
but
brading
turned
back
he
with
lantern
and
pistol
pushed
courageously
forward
into
the
wood
passing
through
a
difficult
undergrowth
he
came
into
a
small
opening
and
there
his
courage
had
its
reward
for
there
he
found
the
body
of
his
victim
but
it
was
no
panther
what
it
was
is
told
even
to
this
day
upon
a
weather-worn
headstone
in
the
village
churchyard
and
for
many
years
was
attested
daily
at
the
graveside
by
the
bent
figure

face
