about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
in
the
outskirts
of
the
small
but
fortified
town
of
terneuse
situated
on
the
right
bank
of
the
scheldt
and
nearly
opposite
to
the
island
of
walcheren
there
was
to
be
seen
in
advance
of
a
few
other
even
more
humble
tenements
a
small
but
neat
cottage
built
according
to
the
prevailing
taste
of
the
time
the
outside
front
had
some
years
back
been
painted
of
a
deep
orange
the
windows
and
shutters
of
a
vivid
green
to
about
three
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
earth
it
was
faced
alternately
with
blue
and
white
tiles
a
small
garden
of
about
two
rods
of
our
measure
of
land
surrounded
the
edifice
and
this
little
plot
was
flanked
by
a
low
hedge
of
privet
and
encircled
by
a
moat
full
of
water
too
wide
to
be
leaped
with
ease
over
that
part
of
the
moat
which
was
in
front
of
the
cottage-door
was
a
small
and
narrow
bridge
with
ornamented
iron
handrails
for
the
security
of
the
passenger
but
the
colours
originally
so
bright
with
which
the
cottage
had
been
decorated
had
now
faded
symptoms
of
rapid
decay
were
evident
in
the
window-sills
the
door-jambs
and
other
wooden
parts
of
the
tenement
and
many
of
the
white
and
blue
tiles
had
fallen
down
and
had
not
been
replaced
that
much
care
had
once
been
bestowed
upon
this
little
tenement
was
as
evident
as
that
latterly
it
had
been
equally
neglected
the
inside
of
the
cottage
both
on
the
basement
and
the
floor
above
was
divided
into
two
larger
rooms
in
front
and
two
smaller
behind
the
rooms
in
front
could
only
be
called
large
in
comparison
with
the
other
two
as
they
were
little
more
than
twelve
feet
square
with
but
one
window
to
each
the
upper
floor
was
as
usual
appropriated
to
the
bedrooms
on
the
lower
the
two
smaller
rooms
were
now
used
only
as
a
wash-house
and
a
lumber-room
while
one
of
the
larger
was
fitted
up
as
a
kitchen
and
furnished
with
dressers
on
which
the
metal
utensils
for
cookery
shone
clean
and
polished
as
silver
the
room
itself
was
scrupulously
neat
but
the
furniture
as
well
as
the
utensils
were
scanty
the
boards
of
the
floor
were
of
a
pure
white
and
so
clean
that
you
might
have
laid
anything
down
without
fear
of
soiling
it
a
strong
deal
table
two
wooden-seated
chairs
and
a
small
easy
couch
which
had
been
removed
from
one
of
the
bedrooms
upstairs
were
all
the
moveables
which
this
room
contained
the
other
front
room
had
been
fitted
up
as
a
parlour
but
what
might
be
the
style
of
its
furniture
was
now
unknown
for
no
eye
had
beheld
the
contents
of
that
room
for
nearly
seventeen
years
during
which
it
had
been
hermetically
sealed
even
to
the
inmates
of
the
cottage
the
kitchen
which
we
have
described
was
occupied
by
two
persons
one
was
a
woman
apparently
about
forty
years
of
age
but
worn
down
by
pain
and
suffering
she
had
evidently
once
possessed
much
beauty
there
were
still
the
regular
outlines
the
noble
forehead
and
the
large
dark
eye
but
there
was
a
tenuity
in
her
features
a
wasted
appearance
such
as
to
render
the
flesh
transparent
her
brow
when
she
mused
would
sink
into
deep
wrinkles
premature
though
they
were
and
the
occasional
flashing
of
her
eyes
strongly
impressed
you
with
the
idea
of
insanity
there
appeared
to
be
some
deep-seated
irremoveable
hopeless
cause
of
anguish
never
for
one
moment
permitted
to
be
absent
from
her
memory
a
chronic
oppression
fixed
and
graven
there
only
to
be
removed
by
death
she
was
dressed
in
the
widow's
coif
of
the
time
but
although
clean
and
neat
her
garments
were
faded
from
long
wear
she
was
seated
upon
the
small
couch
which
we
have
mentioned
evidently
brought
down
as
a
relief
to
her
in
her
declining
state
on
the
deal
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
sat
the
other
person
a
stout
fair-haired
florid
youth
of
nineteen
or
twenty
years
old
his
features
were
handsome
and
bold
and
his
frame
powerful
to
excess
his
eye
denoted
courage
and
determination
and
as
he
carelessly
swung
his
legs
and
whistled
an
air
in
an
emphatic
manner
it
was
impossible
not
to
form
the
idea
that
he
was
a
daring
adventurous
and
reckless
character
do
not
go
to
sea
philip
oh
promise
me
that
my
dear
child
said
the
female
clasping
her
hands
and
why
not
go
to
sea
mother
replied
philip
what's
the
use
of
my
staying
here
to
starve--for
by
heaven
it's
little
better
i
must
do
something
for
myself
and
for
you
and
what
else
can
i
do
my
uncle
van
brennen
has
offered
to
take
me
with
him
and
will
give
me
good
wages
then
i
shall
live
happily
on
board
and
my
earnings
will
be
sufficient
for
your
support
at
home
philip--philip
hear
me
i
shall
die
if
you
leave
me
whom
have
i
in
the
world
but
you
o
my
child
as
you
love
me
and
i
know
you
do
love
me
philip
don't
leave
me
but
if
you
will
at
all
events
do
not
go
to
sea
philip
gave
no
immediate
reply
he
whistled
for
a
few
seconds
while
his
mother
wept
is
it
said
he
at
last
because
my
father
was
drowned
at
sea
that
you
beg
so
hard
mother
oh
no--no
exclaimed
the
sobbing
woman
would
to
god--
would
to
god
what
mother
nothing--nothing
be
merciful--be
merciful
o
god
replied
the
mother
sliding
from
her
seat
on
the
couch
and
kneeling
by
the
side
of
it
in
which
attitude
she
remained
for
some
time
in
fervent
prayer
at
last
she
resumed
her
seat
and
her
face
wore
an
aspect
of
more
composure
philip
who
during
this
had
remained
silent
and
thoughtful
again
addressed
his
mother
look
ye
mother
you
ask
me
to
stay
on
shore
with
you
and
starve--
rather
hard
conditions--now
hear
what
i
have
to
say
that
room
opposite
has
been
shut
up
ever
since
i
can
remember--why
you
will
never
tell
me
but
once
i
heard
you
say
when
we
were
without
bread
and
with
no
prospect
of
my
uncle's
return--you
were
then
half
frantic
mother
as
you
know
you
sometimes
are--
well
philip
what
did
you
hear
me
say
inquired
his
mother
with
tremulous
anxiety
you
said
mother
that
there
was
money
in
that
room
which
would
save
us
and
then
you
screamed
and
raved
and
said
that
you
preferred
death
now
mother
what
is
there
in
that
chamber
and
why
has
it
been
so
long
shut
up
either
i
know
that
or
i
go
to
sea
at
the
commencement
of
this
address
of
philip
his
mother
appeared
to
be
transfixed
and
motionless
as
a
statue
gradually
her
lips
separated
and
her
eyes
glared
she
seemed
to
have
lost
the
power
of
reply
she
put
her
hand
to
her
right
side
as
if
to
compress
it
then
both
her
hands
as
if
to
relieve
herself
from
excruciating
torture
at
last
she
sank
with
her
head
forward
and
the
blood
poured
out
of
her
mouth
philip
sprang
from
the
table
to
her
assistance
and
prevented
her
from
falling
on
the
floor
he
laid
her
on
the
couch
watching
with
alarm
the
continued
effusion
oh
mother--mother
what
is
this
cried
he
at
last
in
great
distress
for
some
time
his
mother
could
make
him
no
reply
she
turned
further
on
her
side
that
she
might
not
be
suffocated
by
the
discharge
from
the
ruptured
vessel
and
the
snow-white
planks
of
the
floor
were
soon
crimsoned
with
her
blood
speak
dearest
mother
if
you
can
repeated
philip
in
agony
what
shall
i
do--what
shall
i
give
you
god
almighty
what
is
this
death
my
child
death
at
length
replied
the
poor
woman
sinking
into
a
state
of
unconsciousness
philip
now
much
alarmed
flew
out
of
the
cottage
and
called
the
neighbours
to
his
mother's
assistance
two
or
three
hastened
to
the
call
and
as
soon
as
philip
saw
them
occupied
in
restoring
his
mother
he
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
to
the
house
of
a
medical
man
who
lived
about
a
mile
off--one
mynheer
poots
a
little
miserable
avaricious
wretch
but
known
to
be
very
skilful
in
his
profession
philip
found
poots
at
home
and
insisted
upon
his
immediate
attendance
i
will
come--yes
most
certainly
replied
poots
who
spoke
the
language
but
imperfectly
but
mynheer
vanderdecken
who
will
pay
me
pay
you
my
uncle
will
directly
that
he
comes
home
your
uncle
de
skipper
vanbrennen
no
he
owe
me
four
guilders
and
he
has
owed
me
for
a
long
time
besides
his
ship
may
sink
he
shall
pay
you
the
four
guilders
and
for
this
attendance
also
replied
philip
in
a
rage
come
directly--while
you
are
disputing
my
mother
may
be
dead
but
mr
philip
i
cannot
come
now
i
recollect
i
have
to
see
the
child
of
the
burgomaster
at
terneuse
replied
mynheer
poots
look
you
mynheer
poots
exclaimed
philip
red
with
passion
you
have
but
to
choose--will
you
go
quietly
or
must
i
take
you
there
you'll
not
trifle
with
me
here
mynheer
poots
was
under
considerable
alarm
for
the
character
of
philip
vanderdecken
was
well
known
i
will
come
by-and-by
mynheer
philip
if
i
can
you'll
come
now
you
wretched
old
miser
exclaimed
philip
seizing
hold
of
the
little
man
by
the
collar
and
pulling
him
out
of
his
door
murder
murder
cried
poots
as
he
lost
his
legs
and
was
dragged
along
by
the
impetuous
young
man
philip
stopped
for
he
perceived
that
poots
was
black
in
the
face
must
i
then
choke
you
to
make
you
go
quietly
for
hear
me
go
you
shall
alive
or
dead
well
then
replied
poots
recovering
himself
i
will
go
but
i'll
have
you
in
prison
to-night
and
as
for
your
mother
i'll
not--no
that
i
will
not--mynheer
philip
depend
upon
it
mark
me
mynheer
poots
replied
philip
as
sure
as
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
if
you
do
not
come
with
me
i'll
choke
you
now
and
when
you
arrive
if
you
do
not
your
best
for
my
poor
mother
i'll
murder
you
there
you
know
that
i
always
do
what
i
say
so
now
take
my
advice
come
along
quietly
and
you
shall
certainly
be
paid
and
well
paid--if
i
sell
my
coat
this
last
observation
of
philip
perhaps
had
more
effect
than
even
his
threats
poots
was
a
miserable
little
atom
and
like
a
child
in
the
powerful
grasp
of
the
young
man
the
doctor's
tenement
was
isolated
and
he
could
obtain
no
assistance
until
within
a
hundred
yards
of
vanderdecken's
cottage
so
mynheer
poots
decided
that
he
would
go--
first
because
philip
had
promised
to
pay
him
and
secondly
because
he
could
not
help
it
this
point
being
settled
philip
and
mynheer
poots
made
all
haste
to
the
cottage
and
on
their
arrival
they
found
his
mother
still
in
the
arms
of
two
of
her
female
neighbours
who
were
bathing
her
temples
with
vinegar
she
was
in
a
state
of
consciousness
but
she
could
not
speak
poots
ordered
her
to
be
carried
up
stairs
and
put
to
bed
and
pouring
some
acids
down
her
throat
hastened
away
with
philip
to
procure
the
necessary
remedies
you
will
give
your
mother
that
directly
mynheer
philip
said
poots
putting
a
phial
into
his
hand
i
will
now
go
to
the
child
of
the
burgomaster
and
will
afterwards
come
back
to
your
cottage
don't
deceive
me
said
philip
with
a
threatening
look
no
no
mynheer
philip
i
would
not
trust
to
your
uncle
vanbrennen
for
payment
but
you
have
promised
and
i
know
that
you
always
keep
your
word
in
one
hour
i
will
be
with
your
mother
but
you
yourself
must
now
be
quick
philip
hastened
home
after
the
potion
had
been
administered
the
bleeding
was
wholly
stopped
and
in
half
an
hour
his
mother
could
express
her
wishes
in
a
whisper
when
the
little
doctor
arrived
he
carefully
examined
his
patient
and
then
went
down
stairs
with
her
son
into
the
kitchen
mynheer
philip
said
poots
by
allah
i
have
done
my
best
but
i
must
tell
you
that
i
have
little
hopes
of
your
mother
rising
from
her
bed
again
she
may
live
one
day
or
two
days
but
not
more
it
is
not
my
fault
mynheer
philip
continued
poots
in
a
deprecating
tone
no
no
it
is
the
will
of
heaven
replied
philip
mournfully
and
you
will
pay
me
mynheer
vanderdecken
continued
the
doctor
after
a
short
pause
yes
replied
philip
in
a
voice
of
thunder
and
starting
from
a
reverie
after
a
moment's
silence
the
doctor
recommenced
shall
i
come
to-morrow
mynheer
philip
you
know
that
will
be
a
charge
of
another
guilder
it
is
of
no
use
to
throw
away
money
or
time
either
come
to-morrow
come
every
hour
charge
what
you
please
you
shall
certainly
be
paid
replied
philip
curling
his
lip
with
contempt
well
it
is
as
you
please
as
soon
as
she
is
dead
the
cottage
and
the
furniture
will
be
yours
and
you
will
sell
them
of
course
yes
i
will
come
you
will
have
plenty
of
money
mynheer
philip
i
would
like
the
first
offer
of
the
cottage
if
it
is
to
let
philip
raised
his
arm
in
the
air
as
if
to
crush
mynheer
poots
who
retreated
to
the
corner
i
did
not
mean
until
your
mother
was
buried
said
poots
in
a
coaxing
tone
go
wretch
go
said
philip
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
as
he
sank
down
upon
the
blood-stained
couch
after
a
short
interval
philip
vanderdecken
returned
to
the
bedside
of
his
mother
whom
he
found
much
better
and
the
neighbours
having
their
own
affairs
to
attend
to
left
them
alone
exhausted
with
the
loss
of
blood
the
poor
woman
slumbered
for
many
hours
during
which
she
never
let
go
the
hand
of
philip
who
watched
her
breathing
in
mournful
meditation
it
was
about
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
when
the
widow
awoke
she
had
in
a
great
degree
recovered
her
voice
and
thus
she
addressed
her
son--
my
dear
my
impetuous
boy
and
have
i
detained
you
here
a
prisoner
so
long
my
own
inclination
detained
me
mother
i
leave
you
not
to
others
until
you
are
up
and
well
again
that
philip
i
shall
never
be
i
feel
that
death
claims
me
and
o
my
son
were
it
not
for
you
how
should
i
quit
this
world
rejoicing
i
have
long
been
dying
philip--and
long
long
have
i
prayed
for
death
and
why
so
mother
replied
philip
bluntly
i've
done
my
best
you
have
my
child
you
have
and
may
god
bless
you
for
it
often
have
i
seen
you
curb
your
fiery
temper--restrain
yourself
when
justified
in
wrath--to
spare
a
mother's
feelings
'tis
now
some
days
that
even
hunger
has
not
persuaded
you
to
disobey
your
mother
and
philip
you
must
have
thought
me
mad
or
foolish
to
insist
so
long
and
yet
to
give
no
reason
i'll
speak--again--directly
the
widow
turned
her
head
upon
the
pillow
and
remained
quiet
for
some
minutes
then
as
if
revived
she
resumed
i
believe
i
have
been
mad
at
times--have
i
not
philip
and
god
knows
i
have
had
a
secret
in
my
heart
enough
to
drive
a
wife
to
frenzy
it
has
oppressed
me
day
and
night
worn
my
mind
impaired
my
reason
and
now
at
last
thank
heaven
it
has
overcome
this
mortal
frame
the
blow
is
struck
philip--i'm
sure
it
is
i
wait
but
to
tell
you
all--and
yet
i
would
not--'twill
turn
your
brain
as
it
has
turned
mine
philip
mother
replied
philip
earnestly
i
conjure
you
let
me
hear
this
killing
secret
be
heaven
or
hell
mixed
up
with
it
i
fear
not
heaven
will
not
hurt
me
and
satan
i
defy
i
know
thy
bold
proud
spirit
philip--thy
strength
of
mind
if
any
one
could
bear
the
load
of
such
a
dreadful
tale
thou
couldst
my
brain
alas
was
far
too
weak
for
it
and
i
see
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
it
to
thee
the
widow
paused
as
her
thoughts
reverted
to
that
which
she
had
to
confide
for
a
few
minutes
the
tears
rained
down
her
hollow
cheeks
she
then
appeared
to
have
summoned
resolution
and
to
have
regained
strength
philip
it
is
of
your
father
i
would
speak
it
is
supposed--that
he
was--drowned
at
sea
and
was
he
not
mother
replied
philip
with
surprise
o
no
but
he
has
long
been
dead
mother
no--yes--and
yet--no
said
the
widow
covering
her
eyes
her
brain
wanders
thought
philip
but
he
spoke
again
then
where
is
he
mother
the
widow
raised
herself
and
a
tremor
visibly
ran
through
her
whole
frame
as
she
replied--
in
living
judgment
the
poor
woman
then
sank
down
again
upon
the
pillow
and
covered
her
head
with
the
bedclothes
as
if
she
would
have
hid
herself
from
her
own
memory
philip
was
so
much
perplexed
and
astounded
that
he
could
make
no
reply
a
silence
of
some
minutes
ensued
when
no
longer
able
to
bear
the
agony
of
suspense
philip
faintly
whispered--
the
secret
mother
the
secret
quick
let
me
hear
it
i
can
now
tell
all
philip
replied
his
mother
in
a
solemn
tone
of
voice
hear
me
my
son
your
father's
disposition
was
but
too
like
your
own--o
may
his
cruel
fate
be
a
lesson
to
you
my
dear
dear
child
he
was
a
bold
a
daring
and
they
say
a
first-rate
seaman
he
was
not
born
here
but
in
amsterdam
but
he
would
not
live
there
because
he
still
adhered
to
the
catholic
religion
the
dutch
you
know
philip
are
heretics
according
to
our
creed
it
is
now
seventeen
years
or
more
that
he
sailed
for
india
in
his
fine
ship
the
amsterdammer
with
a
valuable
cargo
it
was
his
third
voyage
to
india
philip
and
it
was
to
have
been
if
it
had
so
pleased
god
his
last
for
he
had
purchased
that
good
ship
with
only
part
of
his
earnings
and
one
more
voyage
would
have
made
his
fortune
o
how
often
did
we
talk
over
what
we
would
do
upon
his
return
and
how
these
plans
for
the
future
consoled
me
at
the
idea
of
his
absence
for
i
loved
him
dearly
philip--he
was
always
good
and
kind
to
me
and
after
he
had
sailed
how
i
hoped
for
his
return
the
lot
of
a
sailor's
wife
is
not
to
be
envied
alone
and
solitary
for
so
many
months
watching
the
long
wick
of
the
candle
and
listening
to
the
howling
of
the
wind--foreboding
evil
and
accident--wreck
and
widowhood
he
had
been
gone
about
six
months
philip
and
there
was
still
a
long
dreary
year
to
wait
before
i
could
expect
him
back
one
night
you
my
child
were
fast
asleep
you
were
my
only
solace--my
comfort
in
my
loneliness
i
had
been
watching
over
you
in
your
slumbers
you
smiled
and
half
pronounced
the
name
of
mother
and
at
last
i
kissed
your
unconscious
lips
and
i
knelt
and
prayed--prayed
for
god's
blessing
on
you
my
child
and
upon
him
too--little
thinking
at
the
time
that
he
was
so
horribly
so
fearfully
cursed
the
widow
paused
for
breath
and
then
resumed
philip
could
not
speak
his
lips
were
sundered
and
his
eyes
riveted
upon
his
mother
as
he
devoured
her
words
i
left
you
and
went
down
stairs
into
that
room
philip
which
since
that
dreadful
night
has
never
been
re-opened
i
sate
me
down
and
read
for
the
wind
was
strong
and
when
the
gale
blows
a
sailor's
wife
can
seldom
sleep
it
was
past
midnight
and
the
rain
poured
down
i
felt
unusual
fear--i
knew
not
why
i
rose
from
the
couch
and
dipped
my
finger
in
the
blessed
water
and
i
crossed
myself
a
violent
gust
of
wind
roared
round
the
house
and
alarmed
me
still
more
i
had
a
painful
horrible
foreboding
when
of
a
sudden
the
windows
and
window-shutters
were
all
blown
in
the
light
was
extinguished
and
i
was
left
in
utter
darkness
i
screamed
with
fright--but
at
last
i
recovered
myself
and
was
proceeding
towards
the
window
that
i
might
reclose
it
when
whom
should
i
behold
slowly
entering
at
the
casement
but--your
father--
philip--yes
philip--it
was
your
father
merciful
god
muttered
philip
in
a
low
tone
almost
subdued
into
a
whisper
i
knew
not
what
to
think--he
was
in
the
room
and
although
the
darkness
was
intense
his
form
and
features
were
as
clear
and
as
defined
as
if
it
were
noon-day
fear
would
have
inclined
me
to
recoil
from--
his
loved
presence
to
fly
towards
him
i
remained
on
the
spot
where
i
was
choked
with
agonising
sensations
when
he
had
entered
the
room
the
windows
and
shutters
closed
of
themselves
and
the
candle
was
relighted--then
i
thought
it
was
his
apparition
and
i
fainted
on
the
floor
when
i
recovered
i
found
myself
on
the
couch
and
perceived
that
a
cold
o
how
cold
and
dripping
hand
was
clasped
in
mine
this
reassured
me
and
i
forgot
the
supernatural
signs
which
accompanied
his
appearance
i
imagined
that
he
had
been
unfortunate
and
had
returned
home
i
opened
my
eyes
and
beheld
my
loved
husband
and
threw
myself
into
his
arms
his
clothes
were
saturated
with
the
rain
i
felt
as
if
i
had
embraced
ice--but
nothing
can
check
the
warmth
of
woman's
love
philip
he
received
my
caresses
but
he
caressed
not
again
he
spoke
not
but
looked
thoughtful
and
unhappy
william--william'
cried
i
speak
to
your
dear
catherine'
i
will'
replied
he
solemnly
for
my
time
is
short'
no
no
you
must
not
go
to
sea
again
you
have
lost
your
vessel
but
you
are
safe
have
i
not
you
again'
alas
no--be
not
alarmed
but
listen
for
my
time
is
short
i
have
not
lost
my
vessel
catherine
but
i
have
lost--make
no
reply
but
listen
i
am
not
dead
nor
yet
am
i
alive
i
hover
between
this
world
and
the
world
of
spirits
mark
me'
for
nine
weeks
did
i
try
to
force
my
passage
against
the
elements
round
the
stormy
cape
but
without
success
and
i
swore
terribly
for
nine
weeks
more
did
i
carry
sail
against
the
adverse
winds
and
currents
and
yet
could
gain
no
ground
and
then
i
blasphemed--ay
terribly
blasphemed
yet
still
i
persevered
the
crew
worn
out
with
long
fatigue
would
have
had
me
return
to
the
table
bay
but
i
refused
nay
more
i
became
a
murderer--unintentionally
it
is
true
but
still
a
murderer
the
pilot
opposed
me
and
persuaded
the
men
to
bind
me
and
in
the
excess
of
my
fury
when
he
took
me
by
the
collar
i
struck
at
him
he
reeled
and
with
the
sudden
lurch
of
the
vessel
he
fell
overboard
and
sank
even
this
fearful
death
did
not
restrain
me
and
i
swore
by
the
fragment
of
the
holy
cross
preserved
in
that
relic
now
hanging
round
your
neck
that
i
would
gain
my
point
in
defiance
of
storm
and
seas
of
lightning
of
heaven
or
of
hell
even
if
i
should
beat
about
until
the
day
of
judgment'
my
oath
was
registered
in
thunder
and
in
streams
of
sulphurous
fire
the
hurricane
burst
upon
the
ship
the
canvass
flew
away
in
ribbons
mountains
of
seas
swept
over
us
and
in
the
centre
of
a
deep
o'erhanging
cloud
which
shrouded
all
in
utter
darkness
were
written
in
letters
of
livid
flame
these
words--until
the
day
of
judgement'
listen
to
me
catherine
my
time
is
short
one
hope
alone
remains
and
for
this
am
i
permitted
to
come
here
take
this
letter'
he
put
a
sealed
paper
on
the
table
read
it
catherine
dear
and
try
if
you
can
assist
me
read
it
and
now
farewell--my
time
is
come'
again
the
window
and
window-shutters
burst
open--again
the
light
was
extinguished
and
the
form
of
my
husband
was
as
it
were
wafted
in
the
dark
expanse
i
started
up
and
followed
him
with
outstretched
arms
and
frantic
screams
as
he
sailed
through
the
window--my
glaring
eyes
beheld
his
form
borne
away
like
lightning
on
the
wings
of
the
wild
gale
till
it
was
lost
as
a
speck
of
light
and
then
it
disappeared
again
the
windows
closed
the
light
burned
and
i
was
left
alone
heaven
have
mercy
my
brain--my
brain--philip--philip
shrieked
the
poor
woman
don't
leave
me--don't--don't--pray
don't
during
these
exclamations
the
frantic
widow
had
raised
herself
from
the
bed
and
at
the
last
had
fallen
into
the
arms
of
her
son
she
remained
there
some
minutes
without
motion
after
a
time
philip
felt
alarmed
at
her
long
quiescence
he
laid
her
gently
down
upon
the
bed
and
as
he
did
so
her
head
fell
back--her
eyes
were
turned--the
widow
vanderdecken
was
no
more
philip
vanderdecken
strong
as
he
was
in
mental
courage
was
almost
paralysed
by
the
shock
when
he
discovered
that
his
mother's
spirit
had
fled
and
for
some
time
he
remained
by
the
side
of
the
bed
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
corpse
and
his
mind
in
a
state
of
vacuity
gradually
he
recovered
himself
he
rose
smoothed
down
the
pillow
closed
her
eyelids
and
then
clasping
his
hands
the
tears
trickled
down
his
manly
cheeks
he
impressed
a
solemn
kiss
upon
the
pale
white
forehead
of
the
departed
and
drew
the
curtains
round
the
bed
poor
mother
said
he
sorrowfully
as
he
completed
his
task
at
length
thou
hast
found
rest--but
thou
hast
left
thy
son
a
bitter
legacy
and
as
philip's
thoughts
reverted
to
what
had
passed
the
dreadful
narrative
whirled
in
his
imagination
and
scathed
his
brain
he
raised
his
hands
to
his
temples
compressed
them
with
force
and
tried
to
collect
his
thoughts
that
he
might
decide
upon
what
measures
he
should
take
he
felt
that
he
had
no
time
to
indulge
his
grief
his
mother
was
in
peace
but
his
father--where
was
he
he
recalled
his
mother's
words--one
hope
alone
remained
then
there
was
hope
his
father
had
laid
a
paper
on
the
table--could
it
be
there
now
yes
it
must
be--his
mother
had
not
had
the
courage
to
take
it
up
there
was
hope
in
that
paper
and
it
had
lain
unopened
for
more
than
seventeen
years
philip
vanderdecken
resolved
that
he
would
examine
the
fatal
chamber--at
once
he
would
know
the
worst
should
he
do
it
now
or
wait
till
daylight--but
the
key
where
was
it
his
eyes
rested
upon
an
old
japanned
cabinet
in
the
room
he
had
never
seen
his
mother
open
it
in
his
presence
it
was
the
only
likely
place
of
concealment
that
he
was
aware
of
prompt
in
all
his
decisions
he
took
up
the
candle
and
proceeded
to
examine
it
it
was
not
locked
the
doors
swung
open
and
drawer
after
drawer
was
examined
but
philip
discovered
not
the
object
of
his
search
again
and
again
did
he
open
the
drawers
but
they
were
all
empty
it
occurred
to
philip
that
there
might
be
secret
drawers
and
he
examined
for
some
time
in
vain
at
last
he
took
out
all
the
drawers
and
laid
them
on
the
floor
and
lifting
the
cabinet
off
its
stand
he
shook
it
a
rattling
sound
in
one
corner
told
him
that
in
all
probability
the
key
was
there
concealed
he
renewed
his
attempts
to
discover
how
to
gain
it
but
in
vain
daylight
now
streamed
through
the
casements
and
philip
had
not
desisted
from
his
attempts
at
last
wearied
out
he
resolved
to
force
the
back
panel
of
the
cabinet
he
descended
to
the
kitchen
and
returned
with
a
small
chopping-knife
and
hammer
and
was
on
his
knees
busily
employed
forcing
out
the
panel
when
a
hand
was
placed
upon
his
shoulder
philip
started
he
had
been
so
occupied
with
his
search
and
his
wild
chasing
thoughts
that
he
had
not
heard
the
sound
of
an
approaching
footstep
he
looked
up
and
beheld
the
father
seysen
the
priest
of
the
little
parish
with
his
eyes
sternly
fixed
upon
him
the
good
man
had
been
informed
of
the
dangerous
state
of
the
widow
vanderdecken
and
had
risen
at
daylight
to
visit
and
afford
her
spiritual
comfort
how
now
my
son
said
the
priest
fearest
thou
not
to
disturb
thy
mother's
rest
and
wouldst
thou
pilfer
and
purloin
even
before
she
is
in
her
grave
i
fear
not
to
disturb
my
mother's
rest
good
father
replied
philip
rising
on
his
feet
for
she
now
rests
with
the
blessed
neither
do
i
pilfer
or
purloin
it
is
not
gold
i
seek
although
if
gold
there
were
that
gold
would
now
be
mine
i
seek
but
a
key
long
hidden
i
believe
within
this
secret
drawer
the
opening
of
which
is
a
mystery
beyond
my
art
thy
mother
is
no
more
sayest
thou
my
son
and
dead
without
receiving
the
rites
of
our
most
holy
church
why
didst
thou
not
send
for
me
she
died
good
father
suddenly
most
suddenly
in
these
arms
about
two
hours
ago
i
fear
not
for
her
soul
although
i
can
but
grieve
you
were
not
at
her
side
the
priest
gently
opened
the
curtains
and
looked
upon
the
corpse
he
sprinkled
holy
water
on
the
bed
and
for
a
short
time
his
lips
were
seen
to
move
in
silent
prayer
he
then
turned
round
to
philip
why
do
i
see
thee
thus
employed
and
why
so
anxious
to
obtain
that
key
a
mother's
death
should
call
forth
filial
tears
and
prayers
for
her
repose
yet
are
thine
eyes
dry
and
thou
art
employed
upon
an
indifferent
search
while
yet
the
tenement
is
warm
which
but
now
held
her
spirit
this
is
not
seemly
philip
what
is
the
key
thou
seekest
father
i
have
no
time
for
tears--no
time
to
spare
for
grief
or
lamentation
i
have
much
to
do
and
more
to
think
of
than
thought
can
well
embrace
that
i
loved
my
mother
you
know
well
but
the
key
thou
seekest
philip
father
it
is
the
key
of
a
chamber
which
has
not
been
unlocked
for
years
which
i
must--will
open
even
if--
if
what
my
son
i
was
about
to
say
what
i
should
not
have
said
forgive
me
father
i
meant
that
i
must
search
that
chamber
i
have
long
heard
of
that
same
chamber
being
closed
and
that
thy
mother
would
not
explain
wherefore
i
know
well
for
i
have
asked
her
and
have
been
denied
nay
when
as
in
duty
bound
i
pressed
the
question
i
found
her
reason
was
disordered
by
my
importunity
and
therefore
i
abandoned
the
attempt
some
heavy
weight
was
on
thy
mother's
mind
my
son
yet
would
she
never
confess
or
trust
it
with
me
tell
me
before
she
died
hadst
thou
this
secret
from
her
i
had
most
holy
father
wouldst
thou
not
feel
comfort
if
thou
didst
confide
to
me
my
son
i
might
advise
assist--
father
i
would
indeed--i
could
confide
it
to
thee
and
ask
for
thy
assistance--i
know
'tis
not
from
curious
feeling
thou
wouldst
have
it
but
from
a
better
motive
but
of
that
which
has
been
told
it
is
not
yet
manifest
whether
it
is
as
my
poor
mother
says
or
but
the
phantom
of
a
heated
brain
should
it
indeed
be
true
fain
would
i
share
the
burthen
with
you--yet
little
you
might
thank
me
for
the
heavy
load
but
no--at
least
not
now--it
must
not
cannot
be
revealed
i
must
do
my
work--
enter
that
hated
room
alone
fearest
thou
not
father
i
fear
nothing
i
have
a
duty
to
perform--a
dreadful
one
i
grant
but
i
pray
thee
ask
no
more
for
like
my
poor
mother
i
feel
as
if
the
probing
of
the
wound
would
half
unseat
my
reason
i
will
not
press
thee
further
philip
the
time
may
come
when
i
may
prove
of
service
farewell
my
child
but
i
pray
thee
to
discontinue
thy
unseemly
labour
for
i
must
send
in
the
neighbours
to
perform
the
duties
to
thy
departed
mother
whose
soul
i
trust
is
with
its
god
the
priest
looked
at
philip
he
perceived
that
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
there
was
a
vacancy
and
appearance
of
mental
stupefaction
and
as
he
turned
away
the
good
man
shook
his
head
he
is
right
thought
philip
when
once
more
alone
and
he
took
up
the
cabinet
and
placed
it
upon
the
stand
a
few
hours
more
can
make
no
difference
i
will
lay
me
down
for
my
head
is
giddy
philip
went
into
the
adjoining
room
threw
himself
upon
his
bed
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
in
a
sleep
as
sound
as
that
permitted
to
the
wretch
a
few
hours
previous
to
his
execution
during
his
slumbers
the
neighbours
had
come
in
and
had
prepared
everything
for
the
widow's
interment
they
had
been
careful
not
to
wake
the
son
for
they
held
as
sacred
the
sleep
of
those
who
must
wake
up
to
sorrow
among
others
soon
after
the
hour
of
noon
arrived
mynheer
poots
he
had
been
informed
of
the
death
of
the
widow
but
having
a
spare
hour
he
thought
he
might
as
well
call
as
it
would
raise
his
charges
by
another
guilder
he
first
went
into
the
room
where
the
body
lay
and
from
thence
he
proceeded
to
the
chamber
of
philip
and
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
philip
awoke
and
sitting
up
perceived
the
doctor
standing
by
him
well
mynheer
vanderdecken
commenced
the
unfeeling
little
man
so
it's
all
over
i
knew
it
would
be
so
and
recollect
you
owe
me
now
another
guilder
and
you
promised
faithfully
to
pay
me
altogether
with
the
potion
it
will
be
three
guilders
and
a
half--that
is
provided
you
return
my
phial
philip
who
at
first
waking
was
confused
gradually
recovered
his
senses
during
this
address
you
shall
have
your
three
guilders
and
a
half
and
your
phial
to
boot
mr
poots
replied
he
as
he
rose
from
off
the
bed
yes
yes
i
know
you
mean
to
pay
me--if
you
can
but
look
you
mynheer
philip
it
may
be
some
time
before
you
sell
the
cottage
you
may
not
find
a
customer
now
i
never
wish
to
be
hard
upon
people
who
have
no
money
and
i'll
tell
you
what
i'll
do
there
is
a
something
on
your
mother's
neck
it
is
of
no
value--none
at
all
but
to
a
good
catholic
to
help
you
in
your
strait
i
will
take
that
thing
and
then
we
shall
be
quits
you
will
have
paid
me
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
it
philip
listened
calmly
he
knew
to
what
the
little
miser
had
referred--
the
relic
on
his
mother's
neck
that
very
relic
upon
which
his
father
swore
the
fatal
oath
he
felt
that
millions
of
guilders
would
not
have
induced
him
to
part
with
it
leave
the
house
answered
he
abruptly
leave
it
immediately
your
money
shall
be
paid
now
mynheer
poots
in
the
first
place
knew
that
the
setting
of
the
relic
which
was
in
a
square
frame
of
pure
gold
was
worth
much
more
than
the
sum
due
to
him
he
also
knew
that
a
large
price
had
been
paid
for
the
relic
itself
and
as
at
that
time
such
a
relic
was
considered
very
valuable
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
it
would
again
fetch
a
considerable
sum
tempted
by
the
sight
of
it
when
he
entered
the
chamber
of
death
he
had
taken
it
from
the
neck
of
the
corpse
and
it
was
then
actually
concealed
in
his
bosom
so
he
replied--my
offer
is
a
good
one
mynheer
philip
and
you
had
better
take
it
of
what
use
is
such
trash
i
tell
you
no
cried
philip
in
a
rage
well
then
you
will
let
me
have
it
in
my
possession
till
i
am
paid
mynheer
vanderdecken--that
is
but
fair
i
must
not
lose
my
money
when
you
bring
me
my
three
guilders
and
a
half
and
the
phial
i
will
return
it
to
you
philip's
indignation
was
now
without
bounds
he
seized
mynheer
poots
by
the
collar
and
threw
him
out
of
the
door
away
immediately
cried
he
or
by--
there
was
no
occasion
for
philip
to
finish
the
imprecation
the
doctor
had
hastened
away
with
such
alarm
that
he
fell
down
half
the
steps
of
the
staircase
and
was
limping
away
across
the
bridge
he
almost
wished
that
the
relic
had
not
been
in
his
possession
but
his
sudden
retreat
had
prevented
him
even
if
so
inclined
from
replacing
it
on
the
corpse
the
result
of
this
conversation
naturally
turned
philip's
thoughts
to
the
relic
and
he
went
into
his
mother's
room
to
take
possession
of
it
he
opened
the
curtains--the
corpse
was
laid
out--he
put
forth
his
hand
to
untie
the
black
ribbon
it
was
not
there
gone
exclaimed
philip
they
hardly
would
have
removed
it--never
would
it
must
be
that
villain
poots--wretch
but
i
will
have
it
even
if
he
has
swallowed
it
though
i
tear
him
limb
from
limb
philip
darted
down
the
stairs
rushed
out
of
the
house
cleared
the
moat
at
one
bound
and
without
coat
or
hat
flew
away
in
the
direction
of
the
doctor's
lonely
residence
the
neighbours
saw
him
as
he
passed
them
like
the
wind
they
wondered
and
they
shook
their
heads
mynheer
poots
was
not
more
than
half
way
to
his
home
for
he
had
hurt
his
ankle
apprehensive
of
what
might
possibly
take
place
should
his
theft
be
discovered
he
occasionally
looked
behind
him
at
length
to
his
horror
he
beheld
philip
vanderdecken
at
a
distance
bounding
on
in
pursuit
of
him
frightened
almost
out
of
his
senses
the
wretched
pilferer
hardly
knew
how
to
act
to
stop
and
surrender
up
the
stolen
property
was
his
first
thought
but
fear
of
vanderdecken's
violence
prevented
him
so
he
decided
on
taking
to
his
heels
thus
hoping
to
gain
his
house
and
barricade
himself
in
by
which
means
he
would
be
in
a
condition
to
keep
possession
of
what
he
had
stolen
or
at
least
to
make
some
terms
ere
he
restored
it
mynheer
poots
had
need
to
run
fast
and
so
he
did
his
thin
legs
bearing
his
shrivelled
form
rapidly
over
the
ground
but
philip
who
when
he
witnessed
the
doctor's
attempt
to
escape
was
fully
convinced
that
he
was
the
culprit
redoubled
his
exertions
and
rapidly
came
up
with
the
chase
when
within
a
hundred
yards
of
his
own
door
mynheer
poots
heard
the
bounding
steps
of
philip
gain
upon
him
and
he
sprang
and
leaped
in
his
agony
nearer
and
nearer
still
the
step
until
at
last
he
heard
the
very
breathing
of
his
pursuer
and
poots
shrieked
in
his
fear
like
the
hare
in
the
jaws
of
the
greyhound
philip
was
not
a
yard
from
him
his
arm
was
outstretched
when
the
miscreant
dropped
down
paralysed
with
terror
and
the
impetus
of
vanderdecken
was
so
great
that
he
passed
over
his
body
tripped
and
after
trying
in
vain
to
recover
his
equilibrium
he
fell
and
rolled
over
and
over
this
saved
the
little
doctor
it
was
like
the
double
of
a
hare
in
a
second
he
was
again
on
his
legs
and
before
philip
could
rise
and
again
exert
his
speed
poots
had
entered
his
door
and
bolted
it
within
philip
was
however
determined
to
repossess
the
important
treasure
and
as
he
panted
he
cast
his
eyes
around
to
see
if
any
means
offered
for
his
forcing
his
entrance
into
the
house
but
as
the
habitation
of
the
doctor
was
lonely
every
precaution
had
been
taken
by
him
to
render
it
secure
against
robbery
the
windows
below
were
well
barricaded
and
secured
and
those
on
the
upper
story
were
too
high
for
any
one
to
obtain
admittance
by
them
we
must
here
observe
that
although
mynheer
poots
was--from
his
known
abilities
in
good
practice
his
reputation
as
a
hard-hearted
unfeeling
miser
was
well
established
no
one
was
ever
permitted
to
enter
his
threshold
nor
indeed
did
any
one
feel
inclined
he
was
as
isolated
from
his
fellow-creatures
as
was
his
tenement
and
was
only
to
be
seen
in
the
chamber
of
disease
and
death
what
his
establishment
consisted
of
no
one
knew
when
he
first
settled
in
the
neighbourhood
an
old
decrepit
woman
occasionally
answered
the
knocks
given
at
the
door
by
those
who
required
the
doctor's
services
but
she
had
been
buried
some
time
and
ever
since
all
calls
at
the
door
had
been
answered
by
mynheer
poots
in
person
if
he
were
at
home
and
if
not
there
was
no
reply
to
the
most
importunate
summons
it
was
then
surmised
that
the
old
man
lived
entirely
by
himself
being
too
niggardly
to
pay
for
any
assistance
this
philip
also
imagined
and
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
his
breath
he
began
to
devise
some
scheme
by
which
he
would
be
enabled
not
only
to
recover
the
stolen
property
but
also
to
wreak
a
dire
revenge
the
door
was
strong
and
not
to
be
forced
by
any
means
which
presented
themselves
to
the
eye
of
vanderdecken
for
a
few
minutes
he
paused
to
consider
and
as
he
reflected
so
did
his
anger
cool
down
and
he
decided
that
it
would
be
sufficient
to
recover
his
relic
without
having
recourse
to
violence
so
he
called
out
in
a
loud
voice--
mynheer
poots
i
know
that
you
can
hear
me
give
me
back
what
you
have
taken
and
i
will
do
you
no
hurt
but
if
you
will
not
you
must
take
the
consequence
for
your
life
shall
pay
the
forfeit
before
i
leave
this
spot
this
speech
was
indeed
very
plainly
heard
by
mynheer
poots
but
the
little
miser
had
recovered
from
his
fright
and
thinking
himself
secure
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
surrender
the
relic
without
a
struggle
so
the
doctor
answered
not
hoping
that
the
patience
of
philip
would
be
exhausted
and
that
by
some
arrangement
such
as
the
sacrifice
of
a
few
guilders
no
small
matter
to
one
so
needy
as
philip
he
would
be
able
to
secure
what
he
was
satisfied
would
sell
at
a
high
price
vanderdecken
finding
that
no
answer
was
returned
indulged
in
strong
invective
and
then
decided
upon
measures
certainly
in
themselves
by
no
means
undecided
there
was
part
of
a
small
stack
of
dry
fodder
standing
not
far
from
the
house
and
under
the
wall
a
pile
of
wood
for
firing
with
these
vanderdecken
resolved
upon
setting
fire
to
the
house
and
thus
if
he
did
not
gain
his
relic
he
would
at
least
obtain
ample
revenge
he
brought
several
armfuls
of
fodder
and
laid
them
at
the
door
of
the
house
and
upon
that
he
piled
the
faggots
and
logs
of
wood
until
the
door
was
quite
concealed
by
them
he
then
procured
a
light
from
the
steel
flint
and
tinder
which
every
dutchman
carries
in
his
pocket
and
very
soon
he
had
fanned
the
pile
into
a
flame
the
smoke
ascended
in
columns
up
to
the
rafters
of
the
roof
while
the
fire
raged
below
the
door
was
ignited
and
was
adding
to
the
fury
of
the
flames
and
philip
shouted
with
joy
at
the
success
of
his
attempt
now
miserable
despoiler
of
the
dead--now
wretched
thief
now
you
shall
feel
my
vengeance
cried
philip
with
a
loud
voice
if
you
remain
within
you
perish
in
the
flames
if
you
attempt
to
come
out
you
shall
die
by
my
hands
do
you
hear
mynheer
poots--do
you
hear
hardly
had
philip
concluded
this
address
when
the
window
of
the
upper
floor
furthest
from
the
burning
door
was
thrown
open
ay--you
come
now
to
beg
and
to
entreat--but
no--no
cried
philip--
who
stopped
as
he
beheld
at
the
window
what
seemed
to
be
an
apparition
for
instead
of
the
wretched
little
miser
he
beheld
one
of
the
loveliest
forms
nature
ever
deigned
to
mould--an
angelic
creature
of
about
sixteen
or
seventeen
who
appeared
calm
and
resolute
in
the
midst
of
the
danger
by
which
she
was
threatened
her
long
black
hair
was
braided
and
twined
round
her
beautifully-formed
head
her
eyes
were
large
intensely
dark
yet
soft
her
forehead
high
and
white
her
chin
dimpled
her
ruby
lips
arched
and
delicately
fine
her
nose
small
and
straight
a
lovelier
face
could
not
be
well
imagined
it
reminded
you
of
what
the
best
of
painters
have
sometimes
in
their
more
fortunate
moments
succeeded
in
embodying
when
they
would
represent
a
beauteous
saint
and
as
the
flames
wreathed
and
the
smoke
burst
out
in
columns
and
swept
past
the
window
so
might
she
have
reminded
you
in
her
calmness
of
demeanour
of
some
martyr
at
the
stake
what
wouldst
thou
violent
young
man
why
are
the
inmates
of
this
house
to
suffer
death
by
your
means
said
the
maiden
with
composure
for
a
few
seconds
philip
gazed
and
could
make
no
reply
then
the
thought
seized
him
that
in
his
vengeance
he
was
about
to
sacrifice
so
much
loveliness
he
forgot
everything
but
her
danger
and
seizing
one
of
the
large
poles
which
he
had
brought
to
feed
the
flame
he
threw
off
and
scattered
in
every
direction
the
burning
masses
until
nothing
was
left
which
could
hurt
the
building
but
the
ignited
door
itself
and
this
which
as
yet--for
it
was
of
thick
oak
plank--had
not
suffered
very
material
injury
he
soon
reduced
by
beating
it
with
clods
of
earth
to
a
smoking
and
harmless
state
during
these
active
measures
on
the
part
of
philip
the
young
maiden
watched
him
in
silence
all
is
safe
now
young
lady
said
philip
god
forgive
me
that
i
should
have
risked
a
life
so
precious
i
thought
but
to
wreak
my
vengeance
upon
mynheer
poots
and
what
cause
can
mynheer
poots
have
given
for
such
dreadful
vengeance
replied
the
maiden
calmly
what
cause
young
lady
he
came
to
my
house--despoiled
the
dead--took
from
my
mother's
corpse
a
relic
beyond
price
despoiled
the
dead--he
surely
cannot--you
must
wrong
him
young
sir
no
no
it
is
the
fact
lady--and
that
relic--forgive
me--but
that
relic
i
must
have
you
know
not
what
depends
upon
it
wait
young
sir
replied
the
maiden
i
will
soon
return
philip
waited
several
minutes
lost
in
thought
and
admiration
so
fair
a
creature
in
the
house
of
mynheer
poots
who
could
she
be
while
thus
ruminating
he
was
accosted
by
the
silver
voice
of
the
object
of
his
reveries
who
leaning
out
of
the
window
held
in
her
hand
the
black
ribbon
to
which
was
attached
the
article
so
dearly
coveted
here
is
your
relic
sir
said
the
young
female
i
regret
much
that
my
father
should
have
done
a
deed
which
well
might
justify
your
anger
but
here
it
is
continued
she
dropping
it
down
on
the
ground
by
philip
and
now
you
may
depart
your
father
maiden
can
he
be
your
father
said
philip
forgetting
to
take
up
the
relic
which
lay
at
his
feet
she
would
have
retired
from
the
window
without
reply
but
philip
spoke
a
again--
stop
lady
stop
one
moment
until
i
beg
your
forgiveness
for
a
wild
foolish
act
i
swear
by
this
sacred
relic
continued
he
taking
it
from
the
ground
and
raising
it
to
his
lips
that
had
i
known
that
any
unoffending
person
had
been
in
this
house
i
would
not
have
done
the
deed
and
much
do
i
rejoice
that
no
harm
hath
happened
but
there
is
still
danger
lady
the
door
must
be
unbarred
and
the
jambs
which
still
are
glowing
be
extinguished
or
the
house
may
yet
be
burnt
fear
not
for
your
father
maiden
for
had
he
done
me
a
thousand
times
more
wrong
you
will
protect
each
hair
upon
his
head
he
knows
me
well
enough
to
know
i
keep
my
word
allow
me
to
repair
the
injury
i
have
occasioned
and
then
i
will
depart
no
no
don't
trust
him
said
mynheer
poots
from
within
the
chamber
yes
he
may
be
trusted
replied
the
daughter
and
his
services
are
much
needed
for
what
could
a
poor
weak
girl
like
me
and
a
still
weaker
father
do
in
this
strait
open
the
door
and
let
the
house
be
made
secure
the
maiden
then
addressed
philip--he
shall
open
the
door
sir
and
i
will
thank
you
for
your
kind
service
i
trust
entirely
to
your
promise
i
never
yet
was
known
to
break
my
word
maiden
replied
philip
but
let
him
be
quick
for
the
flames
are
bursting
out
again
the
door
was
opened
by
the
trembling
hands
of
mynheer
poots
who
then
made
a
hasty
retreat
upstairs
the
truth
of
what
philip
had
said
was
then
apparent
many
were
the
buckets
of
water
which
he
was
obliged
to
fetch
before
the
fire
was
quite
subdued
but
during
his
exertions
neither
the
daughter
nor
the
father
made
their
appearance
when
all
was
safe
philip
closed
the
door
and
again
looked
up
at
the
window
the
fair
girl
made
her
appearance
and
philip
with
a
low
obeisance
assured
her
that
there
was
then
no
danger
i
thank
you
sir
replied
she--i
thank
you
much
your
conduct
although
hasty
at
the
first
has
yet
been
most
considerate
assure
your
father
maiden
that
all
animosity
on
my
part
hath
ceased
and
that
in
a
few
days
i
will
call
and
satisfy
the
demand
he
hath
against
me
the
window
closed
and
philip
more
excited
but
with
feelings
altogether
different
from
those
with
which
he
had
set
out
looked
at
it
for
a
minute
and
then
bent
his
steps
to
his
own
cottage
the
discovery
of
the
beautiful
daughter
of
mynheer
poots
had
made
a
strong
impression
upon
philip
vanderdecken
and
now
he
had
another
excitement
to
combine
with
those
which
already
overcharged
his
bosom
he
arrived
at
his
own
house
went
upstairs
and
threw
himself
on
the
bed
from
which
he
had
been
roused
by
mynheer
poots
at
first
he
recalled
to
his
mind
the
scene
we
have
just
described
painted
in
his
imagination
the
portrait
of
the
fair
girl
her
eyes
her
expression
her
silver
voice
and
the
words
which
she
had
uttered
but
her
pleasing
image
was
soon
chased
away
by
the
recollection
that
his
mother's
corpse
lay
in
the
adjoining
chamber
and
that
his
father's
secret
was
hidden
in
the
room
below
the
funeral
was
to
take
place
the
next
morning
and
philip
who
since
his
meeting
with
the
daughter
of
mynheer
poots
appeared
even
to
himself
not
so
anxious
for
immediate
examination
of
the
room
resolved
that
he
would
not
open
it
until
after
the
melancholy
ceremony
with
this
resolution
he
fell
asleep
and
exhausted
with
bodily
and
mental
excitement
he
did
not
wake
until
the
next
morning
when
he
was
summoned
by
the
priest
to
assist
at
the
funeral
rites
in
an
hour
all
was
over
the
crowd
dispersed
and
philip
returning
to
the
cottage
bolted
the
door
that
he
might
not
be
interrupted
and
felt
happy
that
he
was
alone
there
is
a
feeling
in
our
nature
which
will
arise
when
we
again
find
ourselves
in
the
tenement
where
death
has
been
and
all
traces
of
it
have
been
removed
it
is
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
and
relief
at
having
rid
ourselves
of
the
memento
of
mortality
the
silent
evidence
of
the
futility
of
our
pursuits
and
anticipations
we
know
that
we
must
one
day
die
but
we
always
wish
to
forget
it
the
continual
remembrance
would
be
too
great
a
check
upon
our
mundane
desires
and
wishes
and
although
we
are
told
that
we
ever
should
have
futurity
in
our
thoughts
we
find
that
life
is
not
to
be
enjoyed
if
we
are
not
permitted
occasional
forgetfulness
for
who
would
plan
what
rarely
he
is
permitted
to
execute
if
each
moment
of
the
day
he
thought
of
death
we
either
hope
that
we
may
live
longer
than
others
or
we
forget
that
we
may
not
if
this
buoyant
feeling
had
not
been
planted
in
our
nature
how
little
would
the
world
have
been
improved
even
from
the
deluge
philip
walked
into
the
room
where
his
mother
had
lain
one
short
hour
before
and
unwittingly
felt
relief
taking
down
the
cabinet
he
now
recommenced
his
task
the
back
panel
was
soon
removed
and
a
secret
drawer
discovered
he
drew
it
out
and
it
contained
what
he
presumed
to
be
the
object
of
his
search--a
large
key
with
a
slight
coat
of
rust
upon
it
which
came
off
upon
its
being
handled
under
the
key
was
a
paper
the
writing
on
which
was
somewhat
discoloured
it
was
in
his
mother's
hand
and
ran
as
follows--
it
is
now
two
nights
since
a
horrible
event
took
place
which
has
induced
me
to
close
the
lower
chamber
and
my
brain
is
still
bursting
with
terror
should
i
not
during
my
lifetime
reveal
what
occurred
still
this
key
will
be
required
as
at
my
death
the
room
will
be
opened
when
i
rushed
from
it
i
hastened
upstairs
and
remained
that
night
with
my
child
the
next
morning
i
summoned
up
sufficient
courage
to
go
down
turn
the
key
and
bring
it
up
into
my
chamber
it
is
now
closed
till
i
close
my
eyes
in
death
no
privation
no
suffering
shall
induce
me
to
open
it
although
in
the
iron
cupboard
under
the
buffet
farthest
from
the
window
there
is
money
sufficient
for
all
my
wants
that
money
will
remain
there
for
my
child
to
whom
if
i
do
not
impart
the
fatal
secret
he
must
be
satisfied
that
it
is
one
which
it
were
better
should
be
concealed--one
so
horrible
as
to
induce
me
to
take
the
steps
which
i
now
do
the
keys
of
the
cupboards
and
buffets
were
i
think
lying
on
the
table
or
in
my
work-box
when
i
quitted
the
room
there
is
a
letter
on
the
table--at
least
i
think
so
it
is
sealed
let
not
the
seal
be
broken
but
by
my
son
and
not
by
him
unless
he
knows
the
secret
let
it
be
burnt
by
the
priest--for
it
is
cursed--and
even
should
my
son
know
all
that
i
do
oh
let
him
pause--let
him
reflect
well
before
he
breaks
the
seal--for
'twere
better
he
should
know
no
more
not
know
more
thought
philip
as
his
eyes
were
still
fixed
upon
the
paper
yes
but
i
must
and
will
know
more
so
forgive
me
dearest
mother
if
i
waste
no
time
in
reflection
it
would
be
but
time
thrown
away
when
one
is
resolved
as
i
am
philip
pressed
his
lips
to
his
mother's
signature
folded
up
the
paper
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
then
taking
the
key
he
proceeded
downstairs
it
was
about
noon
when
philip
descended
to
open
the
chamber
the
sun
shone
bright
the
sky
was
clear
and
all
without
was
cheerful
and
joyous
the
front
door
of
the
cottage
being
closed
there
was
not
much
light
in
the
passage
when
philip
put
the
key
into
the
lock
of
the
long-closed
door
and
with
some
difficulty
turned
it
round
to
say
that
when
he
pushed
open
the
door
he
felt
no
alarm
would
not
be
correct
he
did
feel
alarm
and
his
heart
palpitated
but
he
felt
more
than
was
requisite
of
determination
to
conquer
that
alarm
and
to
conquer
more
should
more
be
created
by
what
he
should
behold
he
opened
the
door
but
did
not
immediately
enter
the
room
he
paused
where
he
stood
for
he
felt
as
if
he
was
about
to
intrude
into
the
retreat
of
a
disembodied
spirit
and
that
that
spirit
might
reappear
he
waited
a
minute
for
the
effort
of
opening
the
door
had
taken
away
his
breath
and
as
he
recovered
himself
he
looked
within
he
could
but
imperfectly
distinguish
the
objects
in
the
chamber
but
through
the
joints
of
the
shutters
there
were
three
brilliant
beams
of
sunshine
forcing
their
way
across
the
room
which
at
first
induced
him
to
recoil
as
if
from
something
supernatural
but
a
little
reflection
reassured
him
after
about
a
minute's
pause
philip
went
into
the
kitchen
lighted
a
candle
and
sighing
deeply
two
or
three
times
as
if
to
relieve
his
heart
he
summoned
his
resolution
and
walked
towards
the
fatal
room
he
first
stopped
at
the
threshold
and
by
the
light
of
the
candle
took
a
hasty
survey
all
was
still
and
the
table
on
which
the
letter
had
been
left
being
behind
the
door
was
concealed
by
its
being
opened
it
must
be
done
thought
philip
and
why
not
at
once
continued
he
resuming
his
courage
and
with
a
firm
step
he
walked
into
the
room
and
went
to
unfasten
the
shutters
if
his
hand
trembled
a
little
when
he
called
to
mind
how
supernaturally
they
had
last
been
opened
it
is
not
surprising
we
are
but
mortal
and
we
shrink
from
contact
with
aught
beyond
this
life
when
the
fastenings
were
removed
and
the
shutters
unfolded
a
stream
of
light
poured
into
the
room
so
vivid
as
to
dazzle
his
eyesight
strange
to
say
this
very
light
of
a
brilliant
day
overthrew
the
resolution
of
philip
more
than
the
previous
gloom
and
darkness
had
done
and
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
he
retreated
hastily
into
the
kitchen
to
re-summon
his
courage
and
there
he
remained
for
some
minutes
with
his
face
covered
and
in
deep
thought
it
is
singular
that
his
reveries
at
last
ended
by
reverting
to
the
fair
daughter
of
mynheer
poots
and
her
first
appearance
at
the
window
and
he
felt
as
if
the
flood
of
light
which
had
just
driven
him
from
the
one
was
not
more
impressive
and
startling
than
her
enchanting
form
at
the
other
his
mind
dwelling
upon
this
beauteous
vision
appeared
to
restore
philip's
confidence
he
now
rose
and
boldly
walked
into
the
room
we
shall
not
describe
the
objects
it
contained
as
they
chanced
to
meet
the
eyes
of
philip
but
attempt
a
more
lucid
arrangement
the
room
was
about
twelve
or
fourteen
feet
square
with
but
one
window
opposite
to
the
door
stood
the
chimney
and
fireplace
with
a
high
buffet
of
dark
wood
on
each
side
the
floor
of
the
room
was
not
dirty
although
about
its
upper
parts
spiders
had
run
their
cobwebs
in
every
direction
in
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
hung
a
quicksilver
globe
a
common
ornament
in
those
days
but
the
major
part
of
it
had
lost
its
brilliancy
the
spiders'
webs
enclosing
it
like
a
shroud
over
the
chimney-piece
were
hung
two
or
three
drawings
framed
and
glazed
but
a
dusty
mildew
was
spotted
over
the
glass
so
that
little
of
them
could
be
distinguished
in
the
centre
of
the
mantelpiece
was
an
image
of
the
virgin
mary
of
pure
silver
in
a
shrine
of
the
same
metal
but
it
was
tarnished
to
the
colour
of
bronze
or
iron
some
indian
figures
stood
on
each
side
of
it
the
glass
doors
of
the
buffets
on
each
side
of
the
chimney-piece
were
also
so
dimmed
that
little
of
what
was
within
could
be
distinguished
the
light
and
heat
which
had
been
poured
into
the
room
even
for
so
short
a
time
had
already
gathered
up
the
damp
of
many
years
and
it
lay
as
a
mist
and
mingled
with
the
dust
upon
the
panes
of
glass
still
here
and
there
a
glittering
of
silver
vessels
could
be
discerned
for
the
glass
doors
had
protected
them
from
turning
black
although
much
dimmed
in
lustre
on
the
wall
facing
the
window
were
other
prints
in
frames
equally
veiled
in
damp
and
cobwebs
and
also
two
bird-cages
the
bird-cages
philip
approached
and
looked
into
them
the
occupants
of
course
had
long
been
dead
but
at
the
bottom
of
the
cages
was
a
small
heap
of
yellow
feathers
through
which
the
little
white
bones
of
the
skeletons
were
to
be
seen
proving
that
they
had
been
brought
from
the
canary
isles
and
at
that
period
such
birds
were
highly
valued
philip
appeared
to
wish
to
examine
everything
before
he
sought
that
which
he
most
dreaded
yet
most
wished
to
find
there
were
several
chairs
round
the
room
on
one
of
them
was
some
linen
he
took
it
up
it
was
some
that
must
have
belonged
to
him
when
he
was
yet
a
child
at
last
philip
turned
his
eyes
to
the
wall
not
yet
examined
that
opposite
the
chimney
piece
through
which
the
door
was
pierced
and
behind
the
door
as
it
lay
open
he
was
to
find
the
table
the
couch
the
work-box
and
the
fatal
letter
as
he
turned
round
his
pulse
which
had
gradually
recovered
its
regular
motion
beat
more
quickly
but
he
made
the
effort
and
it
was
over
at
first
he
examined
the
walls
against
which
were
hung
swords
and
pistols
of
various
sorts
but
chiefly
asiatic
bows
and
arrows
and
other
implements
of
destruction
philip's
eyes
gradually
descended
upon
the
table
and
little
couch
behind
it
where
his
mother
stated
herself
to
have
been
seated
when
his
father
made
his
awful
visit
the
work-box
and
all
its
implements
were
on
the
table
just
as
she
had
left
them
the
keys
she
mentioned
were
also
lying
there
but
philip
looked
and
looked
again
there
was
no
letter
he
now
advanced
nearer
examined
closely--there
was
none
that
he
could
perceive
either
on
the
couch
or
on
the
table--or
on
the
floor
he
lifted
up
the
work-box
to
ascertain
if
it
was
beneath--but
no
he
examined
among
its
contents
but
no
letter
was
there
he
turned
over
the
pillows
of
the
couch
but
still
there
was
no
letter
to
be
found
and
philip
felt
as
if
there
had
been
a
heavy
load
removed
from
his
panting
chest
surely
then
thought
he
as
he
leant
against
the
wall
this
must
have
been
the
vision
of
a
heated
imagination
my
poor
mother
must
have
fallen
asleep
and
dreamt
this
horrid
tale
i
thought
it
was
impossible
at
least
i
hoped
so
it
must
have
been
as
i
suppose
the
dream
was
too
powerful
too
like
a
fearful
reality--partially
unseated
my
poor
mother's
reason
philip
reflected
again
and
was
then
satisfied
that
his
suppositions
were
correct
yes
it
must
have
been
so
poor
dear
mother
how
much
thou
hast
suffered
but
thou
art
now
rewarded
and
with
thy
god
after
a
few
minutes
during
which
he
surveyed
the
room
again
and
again
with
more
coolness
and
perhaps
some
indifference
now
that
he
regarded
the
supernatural
history
as
not
true
philip
took
out
of
his
pocket
the
written
paper
found
with
the
key
and
read
it
over--the
iron
cupboard
under
the
buffet
farthest
from
the
window
'tis
well
he
took
the
bunch
of
keys
from
off
the
table
and
soon
fitted
one
to
the
outside
wooden
doors
which
concealed
the
iron
safe
a
second
key
on
the
bunch
opened
the
iron
doors
and
philip
found
himself
in
possession
of
a
considerable
sum
of
money
amounting
as
near
as
he
could
reckon
to
ten
thousand
guilders
in
little
yellow
sacks
my
poor
mother
thought
he
and
has
a
mere
dream
scared
thee
to
penury
and
want
with
all
this
wealth
in
thy
possession
philip
replaced
the
sacks
and
locked
up
the
cupboards
after
having
taken
out
of
one
already
half
emptied
a
few
pieces
for
his
immediate
wants
his
attention
was
next
directed
to
the
buffets
above
which
with
one
of
the
keys
he
opened
he
found
that
they
contained
china
and
silver
flagons
and
cups
of
considerable
value
the
locks
were
again
turned
and
the
bunch
of
keys
thrown
upon
the
table
the
sudden
possession
of
so
much
wealth
added
to
the
conviction
to
which
philip
had
now
arrived
that
there
had
been
no
supernatural
appearance
as
supposed
by
his
mother
naturally
revived
and
composed
his
spirits
and
he
felt
a
reaction
which
amounted
almost
to
hilarity
seating
himself
on
the
couch
he
was
soon
in
a
reverie
and
as
before
reverted
to
the
lovely
daughter
of
mynheer
poots
indulging
in
various
castle-buildings
all
ending
as
usual
when
we
choose
for
ourselves
in
competence
and
felicity
in
this
pleasing
occupation
he
remained
for
more
than
two
hours
when
his
thoughts
again
reverted
to
his
poor
mother
and
her
fearful
death
dearest
kindest
mother
apostrophised
philip
aloud
as
he
rose
from
his
leaning
position
here
thou
wert
tired
with
watching
over
my
infant
slumbers
thinking
of
my
absent
father
and
his
dangers
working
up
thy
mind
and
anticipating
evil
till
thy
fevered
sleep
conjured
up
this
apparition
yes
it
must
have
been
so
for
see
here
lying
on
the
floor
is
the
embroidery
as
it
fell
from
thy
unconscious
hands
and
with
that
labour
ceased
thy
happiness
in
this
life
dear
dear
mother
continued
he
a
tear
rolling
down
his
cheek
as
he
stooped
to
pick
up
the
piece
of
muslin
how
much
hast
thou
suffered
when--god
of
heaven
exclaimed
philip
as
he
lifted
up
the
embroidery
starting
back
with
violence
and
overturning
the
table
god
of
heaven
and
of
judgment
there
is--there
is
and
philip
clasped
his
hands
and
bowed
his
head
in
awe
and
anguish
as
in
a
changed
and
fearful
tone
he
muttered
forth--the
letter
it
was
but
too
true--underneath
the
embroidery
on
the
floor
had
lain
the
fatal
letter
of
vanderdecken
had
philip
seen
it
on
the
table
when
he
first
went
into
the
room
and
was
prepared
to
find
it
he
would
have
taken
it
up
with
some
degree
of
composure
but
to
find
it
now
when
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
it
was
all
an
illusion
on
the
part
of
his
mother
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
there
had
been
no
supernatural
agency
after
he
had
been
indulging
in
visions
of
future
bliss
and
repose
was
a
shock
that
transfixed
him
where
he
stood
and
for
some
time
he
remained
in
his
attitude
of
surprise
and
terror
down
at
once
fell
the
airy
fabric
of
happiness
which
he
had
built
up
during
the
last
two
hours
and
as
he
gradually
recovered
from
his
alarm
his
heart
filled
with
melancholy
forebodings
at
last
he
dashed
forward
seized
the
letter
and
burst
out
of
the
fatal
room
i
cannot
dare
not
read
it
here
exclaimed
he
no
no
it
must
be
under
the
vault
of
high
and
offended
heaven
that
the
message
must
be
received
philip
took
his
hat
and
went
out
of
the
house
in
calm
despair
he
locked
the
door
took
out
the
key
and
walked
he
knew
not
whither
if
the
reader
can
imagine
the
feelings
of
a
man
who
sentenced
to
death
and
having
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
finds
himself
unexpectedly
reprieved
who
having
recomposed
his
mind
after
the
agitation
arising
from
a
renewal
of
those
hopes
and
expectations
which
he
had
abandoned
once
more
dwells
upon
future
prospects
and
indulges
in
pleasing
anticipations
we
say
that
if
the
reader
can
imagine
this
and
then
what
would
be
that
man's
feelings
when
he
finds
that
the
reprieve
is
revoked
and
that
he
is
to
suffer
he
may
then
form
some
idea
of
the
state
of
philip's
mind
when
he
quitted
the
cottage
long
did
he
walk
careless
in
which
direction
with
the
letter
in
his
clenched
hand
and
his
teeth
firmly
set
gradually
he
became
more
composed
and
out
of
breath
with
the
rapidity
of
his
motion
he
sat
down
upon
a
bank
and
there
he
long
remained
with
his
eyes
riveted
upon
the
dreaded
paper
which
he
held
with
both
his
hands
upon
his
knees
mechanically
he
turned
the
letter
over
the
seal
was
black
philip
sighed--i
cannot
read
it
now
thought
he
and
he
rose
and
continued
his
devious
way
for
another
half-hour
did
philip
keep
in
motion
and
the
sun
was
not
many
degrees
above
the
horizon
philip
stopped
and
looked
at
it
till
his
vision
failed
i
could
imagine
that
it
was
the
eye
of
god
thought
philip
and
perhaps
it
may
be
why
then
merciful
creator
am
i
thus
selected
from
so
many
millions
to
fulfil
so
dire
a
task
philip
looked
about
him
for
some
spot
where
he
might
be
concealed
from
observation--where
he
might
break
the
seal
and
read
this
mission
from
a
world
of
spirits
a
small
copse
of
brushwood
in
advance
of
a
grove
of
trees
was
not
far
from
where
he
stood
he
walked
to
it
and
sat
down
so
as
to
be
concealed
from
any
passers
by
philip
once
more
looked
at
the
descending
orb
of
day
and
by
degrees
he
became
composed
it
is
thy
will
exclaimed
he
it
is
my
fate
and
both
must
be
accomplished
philip
put
his
hand
to
the
seal--his
blood
thrilled
when
he
called
to
mind
that
it
had
been
delivered
by
no
mortal
hand
and
that
it
contained
the
secret
of
one
in
judgment
he
remembered
that
that
one
was
his
father
and
that
it
was
only
in
the
letter
that
there
was
hope--hope
for
his
poor
father
whose
memory
he
had
been
taught
to
love
and
who
appealed
for
help
coward
that
i
am
to
have
lost
so
many
hours
exclaimed
philip
yon
sun
appears
as
if
waiting
on
the
hill
to
give
me
light
to
read
philip
mused
a
short
time
he
was
once
more
the
daring
vanderdecken
calmly
he
broke
the
seal
which
bore
the
initials
of
his
father's
name
and
read
as
follows--
to
catherine
one
of
those
pitying
spirits
whose
eyes
rain
tears
for
mortal
crimes
has
been
permitted
to
inform
me
by
what
means
alone
my
dreadful
doom
may
be
averted
could
i
but
receive
on
the
deck
of
my
own
ship
the
holy
relic
upon
which
i
swore
the
fatal
oath
kiss
it
in
all
humility
and
shed
one
tear
of
deep
contrition
on
the
sacred
wood
i
then
might
rest
in
peace
how
this
may
be
effected
or
by
whom
so
fatal
a
task
will
be
undertaken
i
know
not
o
catherine
we
have
a
son--but
no
no
let
him
not
hear
of
me
pray
for
me
and
now
farewell
i
vanderdecken
then
it
is
true
most
horribly
true
thought
philip
and
my
father
is
even
now
in
living
judgment
and
he
points
to
me--to
whom
else
should
he
am
i
not
his
son
and
is
it
not
my
duty
yes
father
exclaimed
philip
aloud
falling
on
his
knees
you
have
not
written
these
lines
in
vain
let
me
peruse
them
once
more
philip
raised
up
his
hand
but
although
it
appeared
to
him
that
he
had
still
hold
of
the
letter
it
was
not
there--he
grasped
nothing
he
looked
on
the
grass
to
see
if
it
had
fallen--but
no
there
was
no
letter
it
had
disappeared
was
it
a
vision--no
no
he
had
read
every
word
then
it
must
be
to
me
and
me
alone
that
the
mission
was
intended
i
accept
the
sign
hear
me
dear
father--if
thou
art
so
permitted--and
deign
to
hear
me
gracious
heaven--hear
the
son
who
by
this
sacred
relic
swears
that
he
will
avert
your
doom
or
perish
to
that
will
he
devote
his
days
and
having
done
his
duty
he
will
die
in
hope
and
peace
heaven
that
recorded
my
rash
father's
oath
now
register
his
son's
upon
the
same
sacred
cross
and
may
perjury
on
my
part
be
visited
with
punishment
more
dire
than
his
receive
it
heaven
as
at
the
last
i
trust
that
in
thy
mercy
thou
wilt
receive
the
father
and
the
son
and
if
too
bold
o
pardon
my
presumption
philip
threw
himself
forward
on
his
face
with
his
lips
to
the
sacred
symbol
the
sun
went
down
and
the
twilight
gradually
disappeared
night
had
for
some
time
shrouded
all
in
darkness
and
philip
yet
remained
in
alternate
prayer
and
meditation
but
he
was
disturbed
by
the
voices
of
some
men
who
sat
down
upon
the
turf
but
a
few
yards
from
where
he
was
concealed
the
conversation
he
little
heeded
but
it
had
roused
him
and
his
first
feeling
was
to
return
to
the
cottage
that
he
might
reflect
over
his
plans
but
although
the
men
spoke
in
a
low
tone
his
attention
was
soon
arrested
by
the
subject
of
their
conversation
when
he
heard
the
name
mentioned
of
mynheer
poots
he
listened
attentively
and
discovered
that
they
were
four
disbanded
soldiers
who
intended
that
night
to
attack
the
house
of
the
little
doctor
who
had
they
knew
much
money
in
his
possession
what
i
have
proposed
is
the
best
said
one
of
them
he
has
no
one
with
him
but
his
daughter
i
value
her
more
than
his
money
replied
another
so
recollect
before
we
go
it
is
perfectly
understood
that
she
is
to
be
my
property
yes
if
you
choose
to
purchase
her
there's
no
objection
replied
a
third
agreed
how
much
will
you
in
conscience
ask
for
a
paling
girl
i
say
five
hundred
guilders
replied
another
well
be
it
so
but
on
this
condition
that
if
my
share
of
the
booty
does
not
amount
to
so
much
i
am
to
have
her
for
my
share
whatever
it
may
be
that's
very
fair
replied
the
other
but
i'm
much
mistaken
if
we
don't
turn
more
than
two
thousand
guilders
out
of
the
old
man's
chest
what
do
you
two
say--is
it
agreed--shall
baetens
have
her
o
yes
replied
the
others
well
then
replied
the
one
who
had
stipulated
for
mynheer
poots's
daughter
now
i
am
with
you
heart
and
soul
i
loved
that
girl
and
tried
to
get
her--i
positively
offered
to
marry
her
but
the
old
hunks
refused
me
an
ensign
an
officer
but
now
i'll
have
revenge
we
must
not
spare
him
no
no
replied
the
others
shall
we
go
now
or
wait
till
it
is
later
in
an
hour
or
more
the
moon
will
be
up--we
may
be
seen
who
is
to
see
us
unless
indeed
some
one
is
sent
for
him
the
later
the
better
i
say
how
long
will
it
take
us
to
get
there
not
half
an
hour
if
we
walk
suppose
we
start
in
half
an
hour
hence
we
shall
just
have
the
moon
to
count
the
guilders
by
that's
all
right
in
the
meantime
i'll
put
a
new
flint
in
my
lock
and
have
my
carbine
loaded
i
can
work
in
the
dark
you
are
used
to
it
jan
yes
i
am--and
i
intend
this
ball
to
go
through
the
old
rascal's
head
well
i'd
rather
you
should
kill
him
than
i
replied
one
of
the
others
for
he
saved
my
life
at
middleburgh
when
every
one
made
sure
i'd
die
philip
did
not
wait
to
hear
any
more
he
crawled
behind
the
bushes
until
he
gained
the
grove
of
trees
and
passing
through
them
made
a
detour
so
as
not
to
be
seen
by
these
miscreants
that
they
were
disbanded
soldiers
many
of
whom
were
infesting
the
country
he
knew
well
all
his
thoughts
were
now
to
save
the
old
doctor
and
his
daughter
from
the
danger
which
threatened
them
and
for
a
time
he
forgot
his
father
and
the
exciting
revelations
of
the
day
although
philip
had
not
been
aware
in
what
direction
he
had
walked
when
he
set
off
from
the
cottage
he
knew
the
country
well
and
now
that
it
was
necessary
to
act
he
remembered
the
direction
in
which
he
should
find
the
lonely
house
of
mynheer
poots
with
the
utmost
speed
he
made
his
way
for
it
and
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
he
arrived
there
out
of
breath
as
usual
all
was
silent
and
the
door
fastened
philip
knocked
but
there
was
no
reply
again
and
again
he
knocked
and
became
impatient
mynheer
poots
must
have
been
summoned
and
was
not
in
the
house
philip
therefore
called
out
so
as
to
be
heard
within
maiden
if
your
father
is
out
as
i
presume
he
must
be
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say--i
am
philip
vanderdecken
but
now
i
overheard
four
wretches
who
have
planned
to
murder
your
father
and
rob
him
of
his
gold
in
one
hour
or
less
they
will
be
here
and
i
have
hastened
to
warn
and
to
protect
you
if
i
may
i
swear
upon
the
relic
that
you
delivered
to
me
this
morning
that
what
i
state
is
true
philip
waited
a
short
time
but
received
no
answer
maiden
resumed
he
answer
me
if
you
value
that
which
is
more
dear
to
you
than
even
your
father's
gold
to
him
open
the
casement
above
and
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
in
so
doing
there
is
no
risk
and
even
if
it
were
not
dark
already
have
i
seen
you
a
short
time
after
this
second
address
the
casement
of
the
upper
window
was
unbarred
and
the
slight
form
of
the
fair
daughter
of
mynheer
poots
was
to
be
distinguished
by
philip
through
the
gloom
what
wouldst
thou
young
sir
at
this
unseemly
hour
and
what
is
it
thou
wouldst
impart
but
imperfectly
heard
by
me
when
thou
spokest
this
minute
at
the
door
philip
then
entered
into
a
detail
of
all
that
he
had
overheard
and
concluded
by
begging
her
to
admit
him
that
he
might
defend
her
think
fair
maiden
of
what
i
have
told
you
you
have
been
sold
to
one
of
those
reprobates
whose
name
i
think
they
mentioned
was
baetens
the
gold
i
know
you
value
not
but
think
of
thine
own
dear
self--suffer
me
to
enter
the
house
and
think
not
for
one
moment
that
my
story
is
feigned
i
swear
to
thee
by
the
soul
of
my
poor
dear
mother
now
i
trust
in
heaven
that
every
word
is
true
baetens
did
you
say
sir
if
i
mistook
them
not
such
was
the
name
he
said
he
loved
you
once
that
name
i
have
in
memory--i
know
not
what
to
do
or
what
to
say
my
father
has
been
summoned
to
a
birth
and
may
be
yet
away
for
many
hours
yet
how
can
i
ope
the
door
to
you--at
night--he
not
at
home--i
alone
i
ought
not--cannot--yet
do
i
believe
you
you
surely
never
could
be
so
base
as
to
invent
this
tale
no--upon
my
hopes
of
future
bliss
i
could
not
maiden
you
must
not
trifle
with
your
life
and
honour
but
let
me
in
and
if
i
did
what
could
you
do
against
such
numbers
they
are
four
to
one--would
soon
overpower
you
and
one
more
life
would
be
lost
not
if
you
have
arms
and
i
think
your
father
would
not
be
left
without
them
i
fear
them
not--you
know
that
i
am
resolute
i
do
indeed--and
now
you'd
risk
your
life
for
those
you
did
assail
i
thank
you
thank
you
kindly
sir--but
dare
not
ope
the
door
then
maiden
if
you'll
not
admit
me
here
will
i
now
remain
without
arms
and
but
ill
able
to
contend
with
four
armed
villains
but
still
here
will
i
remain
and
prove
my
truth
to
one
i
will
protect
'gainst
any
odds--yes
even
here
then
shall
i
be
thy
murderer--but
that
must
not
be
oh
sir--swear
swear
by
all
that's
holy
and
by
all
that's
pure
that--you
do
not
deceive
me
i
swear
by
thyself
maiden
than
all
to
me
more
sacred
the
casement
closed
and
in
a
short
time
a
light
appeared
above
in
a
minute
or
two
more
the
door
was
opened
to
philip
by
the
fair
daughter
of
mynheer
poots
she
stood
with
the
candle
in
her
right
hand
the
colour
in
her
cheeks
varying--now
flushing
red
and
again
deadly
pale
her
left
hand
was
down
by
her
side
and
in
it
she
held
a
pistol
half
concealed
philip
perceived
this
precaution
on
her
part
but
took
no
notice
of
it
he
wished
to
re-assure
her
maiden
said
he
not
entering
if
you
still
have
doubts--if
you
think
you
have
been
ill
advised
in
giving
me
admission--there
is
yet
time
to
close
the
door
against
me
but
for
your
own
sake
i
entreat
you
not
before
the
moon
is
up
the
robbers
will
be
here
with
my
life
i
will
protect
you
if
you
will
but
trust
me
who
indeed
could
injure
one
like
you
she
was
indeed
as
she
stood
irresolute
and
perplexed
from
the
peculiarity
of
her
situation
yet
not
wanting
in
courage
when
it
was
to
be
called
forth
an
object
well
worthy
of
gaze
and
admiration
her
features
thrown
into
broad
light
and
shade
by
the
candle
which
at
times
was
half
extinguished
by
the
wind--her
symmetry
of
form
and
the
gracefulness
and
singularity
of
her
attire--were
matter
of
astonishment
to
philip
her
head
was
without
covering
and
her
long
hair
fell
in
plaits
behind
her
shoulders
her
stature
was
rather
under
the
middle
size
but
her
form
perfect
her
dress
was
simple
but
becoming
and
very
different
from
that
usually
worn
by
the
young
women
of
the
district
not
only
her
features
but
her
dress
would
at
once
have
indicated
to
a
traveller
that
she
was
of
arab
blood
as
was
the
fact
she
looked
in
philip's
face
as
he
spoke--earnestly
as
if
she
would
have
penetrated
into
his
inmost
thoughts
but
there
was
a
frankness
and
honesty
in
his
bearing
and
a
sincerity
in
his
manly
countenance
which
re-assured
her
after
a
moment's
hesitation
she
replied--
come
in
sir
i
feel
that
i
can
trust
you
philip
entered
the
door
was
then
closed
and
made
secure
we
have
no
time
to
lose
maiden
said
philip
but
tell
me
your
name
that
i
may
address
you
as
i
ought
my
name
is
amine
replied
she
retreating
a
little
i
thank
you
for
that
little
confidence
but
i
must
not
dally
what
arms
have
you
in
the
house
and
have
you
ammunition
both
i
wish
that
my
father
would
come
home
and
so
do
i
replied
philip
devoutedly
wish
he
would
before
these
murderers
come
but
not
i
trust
while
the
attack
is
making
for
there's
a
carbine
loaded
expressly
for
his
head
and
if
they
make
him
prisoner
they
will
not
spare
his
life
unless
his
gold
and
your
person
are
given
in
ransom
but
the
arms
maiden--where
are
they
follow
me
replied
amine
leading
philip
to
an
inner
room
on
the
upper
floor
it
was
the
sanctum
of
her
father
and
was
surrounded
with
shelves
filled
with
bottles
and
boxes
of
drugs
in
one
corner
was
an
iron
chest
and
over
the
mantelpiece
were
a
brace
of
carbines
and
three
pistols
they
are
all
loaded
observed
amine
pointing
to
them
and
laying
on
the
table
the
one
which
she
had
held
in
her
hand
philip
took
down
the
arms
and
examined
all
the
primings
he
then
took
up
from
the
table
the
pistol
which
amine
had
laid
there
and
threw
open
the
pan
it
was
equally
well
prepared
philip
closed
the
pan
and
with
a
smile
observed--
so
this
was
meant
for
me
amine
no--not
for
you--but
for
a
traitor
had
one
gained
admittance
now
maiden
observed
philip
i
shall
station
myself
at
the
casement
which
you
opened
but
without
a
light
in
the
room
you
may
remain
here
and
can
turn
the
key
for
your
security
you
little
know
me
replied
amine
in
that
way
at
least
i
am
not
fearful
i
must
remain
near
you
and
reload
the
arms--a
task
in
which
i
am
well
practised
no
no
replied
philip
you
might
be
hurt
i
may
but
think
you
i
will
remain
here
idly
when
i
can
assist
one
who
risks
his
life
for
me
i
know
my
duty
sir
and
i
shall
perform
it
you
must
not
risk
your
life
amine
replied
philip
my
aim
will
not
be
steady
if
i
know
that
you're
in
danger
but
i
must
take
the
arms
into
the
other
chamber
for
the
time
is
come
philip
assisted
by
amine
carried
the
carbines
and
pistols
into
the
adjoining
chamber
and
amine
then
left
philip
carrying
with
her
the
light
philip
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
opened
the
casement
and
looked
out--there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
he
listened
but
all
was
silent
the
moon
was
just
rising
above
the
distant
hill
but
her
light
was
dimmed
by
fleecy
clouds
and
philip
watched
for
a
few
minutes
at
length
he
heard
a
whispering
below
he
looked
out
and
could
distinguish
through
the
dark
the
four
expected
assailants
standing
close
to
the
door
of
the
house
he
walked
away
softly
from
the
window
and
went
into
the
next
room
to
amine
whom
he
found
busy
preparing
the
ammunition
amine
they
are
at
the
door
in
consultation
you
can
see
them
now
without
risk
i
thank
them
for
they
will
convince
you
that
i
have
told
the
truth
amine
without
reply
went
into
the
front
room
and
looked
out
of
the
window
she
returned
and
laying
her
hand
upon
philip's
arm
she
said--grant
me
your
pardon
for
my
doubts
i
fear
nothing
now
but
that
my
father
may
return
too
soon
and
they
seize
him
philip
left
the
room
again
to
make
his
reconnoissance
the
robbers
did
not
appear
to
have
made
up
their
mind--the
strength
of
the
door
defied
their
utmost
efforts
so
they
attempted
stratagem
they
knocked
and
as
there
was
no
reply
they
continued
to
knock
louder
and
louder
not
meeting
with
success
they
held
another
consultation
and
the
muzzle
of
a
carbine
was
then
put
to
the
keyhole
and
the
piece
discharged
the
lock
of
the
door
was
blown
off
but
the
iron
bars
which
crossed
the
door
within
above
and
below
still
held
it
fast
although
philip
would
have
been
justified
in
firing
upon
the
robbers
when
he
first
perceived
them
in
consultation
at
the
door
still
there
is
that
feeling
in
a
generous
mind
which
prevents
the
taking
away
of
life
except
from
stern
necessity
and
this
feeling
made
him
withhold
his
fire
until
hostilities
had
actually
commenced
he
now
levelled
one
of
the
carbines
at
the
head
of
the
robber
nearest
to
the
door
who
was
busy
examining
the
effect
which
the
discharge
of
the
piece
had
made
and
what
further
obstacles
intervened
the
aim
was
true
and
the
man
fell
dead
while
the
others
started
back
with
surprise
at
the
unexpected
retaliation
but
in
a
second
or
two
a
pistol
was
discharged
at
philip
who
still
remained
leaning
out
of
the
casement
fortunately
without
effect
and
the
next
moment
he
felt
himself
drawn
away
so
as
to
be
protected
from
their
fire
it
was
amine
who
unknown
to
philip
had
been
standing
by
his
side
you
must
not
expose
yourself
philip
said
she
in
a
low
tone
she
called
me
philip
thought
he
but
made
no
reply
they
will
be
watching
for
you
at
the
casement
now
said
amine
take
the
other
carbine
and
go
below
in
the
passage
if
the
lock
of
the
door
is
blown
off
they
may
put
their
arms
in
perhaps
and
remove
the
bars
i
do
not
think
they
can
but
i'm
not
sure
at
all
events
it
is
there
you
should
now
be
as
there
they
will
not
expect
you
you
are
right
replied
philip
going
down
but
you
must
not
fire
more
than
once
there
if
another
fall
there
will
be
but
two
to
deal
with
and
they
cannot
watch
the
casement
and
force
admittance
too
go--i
will
reload
the
carbine
philip
descended
softly
and
without
a
light
he
went
up
to
the
door
and
perceived
that
one
of
the
miscreants
with
his
arm
through
the
hole
where
the
lock
was
blown
off
was
working
at
the
upper
iron
bar
which
he
could
just
reach
he
presented
his
carbine
and
was
about
to
fire
the
whole
charge
into
the
body
of
the
man
under
his
raised
arm
when
there
was
a
report
of
fire-arms
from
the
robbers
outside
amine
has
exposed
herself
thought
philip
and
may
be
hurt
the
desire
of
vengeance
prompted
him
first
to
fire
his
piece
through
the
man's
body
and
then
he
flew
up
the
stairs
to
ascertain
the
state
of
amine
she
was
not
at
the
casement
he
darted
into
the
inner
room
and
found
her
deliberately
loading
the
carbine
my
god
how
you
frightened
me
amine
i
thought
by
their
firing
that
you
had
shown
yourself
at
the
window
indeed
i
did
not
but
i
thought
that
when
you
fired
through
the
door
they
might
return
your
fire
and
you
be
hurt
so
i
went
to
the
side
of
the
casement
and
pushed
out
on
a
stick
some
of
my
father's
clothes
and
they
who
were
watching
for
you
fired
immediately
indeed
amine
who
could
have
expected
such
courage
and
such
coolness
in
one
so
young
and
beautiful
exclaimed
philip
with
surprise
are
none
but
ill-favoured
people
brave
then
replied
amine
smiling
i
did
not
mean
that
amine--but
i
am
losing
time
i
must
to
the
door
again
give
me
that
carbine
and
reload
this
philip
crept
down
stairs
that
he
might
reconnoitre
but
before
he
had
gained
the
door
he
heard
at
a
distance
the
voice
of
mynheer
poots
amine
who
also
heard
it
was
in
a
moment
at
his
side
with
a
loaded
pistol
in
each
hand
fear
not
amine
said
philip
as
he
unbarred
the
door
there
are
but
two
and
your
father
shall
be
saved
the
door
was
opened
and
philip
seizing
his
carbine
rushed
out
he
found
mynheer
poots
on
the
ground
between
the
two
men
one
of
whom
had
raised
his
knife
to
plunge
it
into
his
body
when
the
ball
of
the
carbine
whizzed
through
his
head
the
last
of
the
robbers
closed
with
philip
and
a
desperate
struggle
ensued--it
was
however
soon
decided
by
amine
stepping
forward
and
firing
one
of
the
pistols
through
the
robber's
body
we
must
here
inform
our
readers
that
mynheer
poots
when
coming
home
had
heard
the
report
of
fire-arms
in
the
direction
of
his
own
house
the
recollection
of
his
daughter
and
of
his
money--for
to
do
him
justice
he
did
love
her
best--had
lent
him
wings
he
forgot
that
he
was
a
feeble
old
man
and
without
arms
all
he
thought
of
was
to
gain
his
habitation
on
he
came
reckless
frantic
and
shouting
and
rushed
into
the
arms
of
the
two
robbers
who
seized
and
would
have
despatched
him
had
not
philip
so
opportunely
come
to
his
assistance
as
soon
as
the
last
robber
fell
philip
disengaged
himself
and
went
to
the
assistance
of
mynheer
poots
whom
he
raised
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
into
the
house
as
if
he
were
an
infant
the
old
man
was
still
in
a
state
of
delirium
from
fear
and
previous
excitement
in
a
few
minutes
mynheer
poots
was
more
coherent
my
daughter
exclaimed
he--my
daughter
where
is
she
she
is
here
father
and
safe
replied
amine
ah
my
child
is
safe
said
he
opening
his
eyes
and
staring
yes
it
is
even
so--and
my
money--my
money--where
is
my
money
continued
he
starting
up
quite
safe
father
quite
safe--you
say
quite
safe--are
you
sure
of
it--let
me
see
there
it
is
father
as
you
may
perceive
quite
safe--thanks
to
one
whom
you
have
not
treated
so
well
who--what
do
you
mean--ah
yes
i
see
him
now--'tis
philip
vanderdecken--he
owes
me
three
guilders
and
a
half
and
there
is
a
phial--did
he
save
you--and
my
money
child
he
did
indeed
at
the
risk
of
his
life
well
well
i
will
forgive
him
the
whole
debt--yes
the
whole
of
it
but--the
phial
is
of
no
use
to
him--he
must
return
that
give
me
some
water
it
was
some
time
before
the
old
man
could
regain
his
perfect
reason
philip
left
him
with
his
daughter
and
taking
a
brace
of
loaded
pistols
went
out
to
ascertain
the
fate
of
the
four
assailants
the
moon
having
climbed
above
the
bank
of
clouds
which
had
obscured
her
was
now
high
in
the
heavens
shining
bright
and
he
could
distinguish
clearly
the
two
men
lying
across
the
threshold
of
the
door
were
quite
dead
the
others
who
had
seized
upon
mynheer
poots
were
still
alive
but
one
was
expiring
and
the
other
bled
fast
philip
put
a
few
questions
to
the
latter
but
he
either
would
not
or
could
not
make
any
reply
he
removed
their
weapons
and
returned
to
the
house
where
he
found
the
old
man
attended
by
his
daughter
in
a
state
of
comparative
composure
i
thank
you
philip
vanderdecken--i
thank
you
much
you
have
saved
my
dear
child
and
my
money--that
is
little
very
little--for
i
am
poor
may
you
live
long
and
happily
philip
mused
the
letter
and
his
vow
were
for
the
first
time
since
he
fell
in
with
the
robbers
recalled
to
his
recollection
and
a
shade
passed
over
his
countenance
long
and
happily--no
no
muttered
he
with
an
involuntary
shake
of
the
head
and
i
must
thank
you
said
amine
looking
inquiringly
in
philip's
face
o
how
much
have
i
to
thank
you
for--and
indeed
i
am
grateful
yes
yes
she
is
very
grateful
interrupted
the
old
man
but
we
are
poor--very
poor
i
talked
about
my
money
because
i
have
so
little
and
i
cannot
afford
to
lose
it
but
you
shall
not
pay
me
the
three
guilders
and
a
half--i
am
content
to
lose
that
mr
philip
why
should
you
lose
even
that
mynheer
poots--i
promised
to
pay
you
and
will
keep
my
word
i
have
plenty
of
money--thousands
of
guilders
and
know
not
what
to
do
with
them
you--you--thousands
of
guilders
exclaimed
poots
pooh
nonsense
that
won't
do
i
repeat
to
you
amine
said
philip
that
i
have
thousands
of
guilders
you
know
i
would
not
tell
you
a
falsehood
i
believed
you
when
you
said
so
to
my
father
replied
amine
then
perhaps
as
you
have
so
much
and
i
am
so
very
poor
mr
vanderdecken--
but
amine
put
her
hand
upon
her
father's
lips
and
the
sentence
was
not
finished
father
said
amine
it
is
time
that
we
retire
you
must
leave
us
for
to-night
philip
i
will
not
replied
philip
nor
you
may
depend
upon
it
will
i
sleep
you
may
both
to
bed
in
safety
it
is
indeed
time
that
you
retire--good
night
mynheer
poots
i
will
but
ask
a
lamp
and
then
i
leave
you--amine
good
night
good
night
said
amine
extending
her
hand
and
many
many
thanks
thousands
of
guilders
muttered
the
old
man
as
philip
left
the
room
and
went
below
philip
vanderdecken
sat
down
at
the
porch
of
the
door
he
swept
his
hair
from
his
forehead
which
he
exposed
to
the
fanning
of
the
breeze
for
the
continued
excitement
of
the
last
three
days
had
left
a
fever
on
his
brain
which
made
him
restless
and
confused
he
longed
for
repose
but
he
knew
that
for
him
there
was
no
rest
he
had
his
forebodings--he
perceived
in
the
vista
of
futurity
a
long-continued
chain
of
danger
and
disaster
even
to
death
yet
he
beheld
it
without
emotion
and
without
dread
he
felt
as
if
it
were
only
three
days
that
he
had
begun
to
exist
he
was
melancholy
but
not
unhappy
his
thoughts
were
constantly
recurring
to
the
fatal
letter--its
strange
supernatural
disappearance
seemed
pointedly
to
establish
its
supernatural
origin
and
that
the
mission
had
been
intended
for
him
alone
and
the
relic
in
his
possession
more
fully
substantiated
the
fact
it
is
my
fate
my
duty
thought
philip
having
satisfactorily
made
up
his
mind
to
these
conclusions
his
thoughts
reverted
to
the
beauty
the
courage
and
presence
of
mind
shown
by
amine
and
thought
he
as
he
watched
the
moon
soaring
high
in
the
heavens
is
this
fair
creature's
destiny
to
be
interwoven
with
mine
the
events
of
the
last
three
days
would
almost
warrant
the
supposition
heaven
only
knows
and
heaven's
will
be
done
i
have
vowed
and
my
vow
is
registered
that
i
will
devote
my
life
to
the
release
of
my
unfortunate
father--but
does
that
prevent
my
loving
amine--no
no
the
sailor
on
the
indian
seas
must
pass
months
and
months
on
shore
before
he
can
return
to
his
duty
my
search
must
be
on
the
broad
ocean
but
how
often
may
i
return
and
why
am
i
to
be
debarred
the
solace
of
a
smiling
hearth--and
yet--do
i
right
in
winning
the
affections
of
one
who
if
she
loves
would
i
am
convinced
love
so
dearly
fondly
truly--ought
i
to
persuade
her
to
mate
herself
with
one
whose
life
will
be
so
precarious--but
is
not
every
sailor's
life
precarious
daring
the
angry
waves
with
but
an
inch
of
plank
'tween
him
and
death
besides
i
am
chosen
to
fulfil
a
task--and
if
so
what
can
hurt
me
till
in
heaven's
own
time
it
is
accomplished
but
then
how
soon
and
how
is
it
to
end--in
death
i
wish
my
blood
were
cooler
that
i
might
reason
better
such
were
the
meditations
of
philip
vanderdecken
and
long
did
he
revolve
such
chances
in
his
mind
at
last
the
day
dawned
and
as
he
perceived
the
blush
upon
the
horizon
less
careful
of
his
watch
he
slumbered
where
he
sat
a
slight
pressure
on
the
shoulder
made
him
start
up
and
draw
the
pistol
from
his
bosom
he
turned
round
and
beheld
amine
and
that
pistol
was
intended
for
me
said
amine
smiling
repeating
philip's
words
of
the
night
before
for
you
amine--yes
to
defend
you
if
'twere
necessary
once
more
i
know
it
would--how
kind
of
you
to
watch
this
tedious
night
after
so
much
exertion
and
fatigue
but
it
is
now
broad
day
until
i
saw
the
dawn
amine
i
kept
a
faithful
watch
but
now
retire
and
take
some
rest
my
father
is
risen--you
can
lie
down
on
his
bed
i
thank
you
but
i
feel
no
wish
for
sleep
there
is
much
to
do
we
must
to
the
burgomaster
and
state
the
facts
and
these
bodies
must
remain
where
they
are
until
the
whole
is
known
will
your
father
go
amine
or
shall
i
my
father
surely
is
the
more
proper
person
as
the
proprietor
of
the
house
you
must
remain
and
if
you
will
not
sleep
you
must
take
some
refreshment
i
will
go
in
and
tell
my
father
he
has
already
taken
his
morning's
meal
amine
went
in
and
soon
returned
with
her
father
who
had
consented
to
go
to
the
burgomaster
he
saluted
philip
kindly
as
he
came
out
shuddered
as
he
passed
on
one
side
to
avoid
stepping
over
the
dead
bodies
and
went
off
at
a
quick
pace
to
the
adjacent
town
where
the
burgomaster
resided
amine
desired
philip
to
follow
her
and
they
went
into
her
father's
room
where
to
his
surprise
he
found
some
coffee
ready
for
him--at
that
time
a
rarity
and
one
which
philip
did
not
expect
to
find
in
the
house
of
the
penurious
mynheer
poots
but
it
was
a
luxury
which
from
his
former
life
the
old
man
could
not
dispense
with
philip
who
had
not
tasted
food
for
nearly
twenty-four
hours
was
not
sorry
to
avail
himself
of
what
was
placed
before
him
amine
sat
down
opposite
to
him
and
was
silent
during
his
repast
amine
said
philip
at
last
i
have
had
plenty
of
time
for
reflection
during
this
night
as
i
watched
at
the
door
may
i
speak
freely
why
not
replied
amine
i
feel
assured
that
you
will
say
nothing
that
you
should
not
say
or
should
not
meet
a
maiden's
ear
you
do
me
justice
amine
my
thoughts
have
been
upon
you
and
your
father
you
cannot
stay
in
this
lone
habitation
i
feel
it
is
too
lonely
that
is
for
his
safety--perhaps
for
mine--but
you
know
my
father--the
very
loneliness
suits
him--the
price
paid
for
rent
is
little
and
he
is
careful
of
his
money
the
man
who
would
be
careful
of
his
money
should
place
it
in
security--
here
it
is
not
secure
now
hear
me
amine
i
have
a
cottage
surrounded
as
you
may
have
heard
by
many
others
which
mutually
protect
each
other
that
cottage
i
am
about
to
leave--perhaps
for
ever
for
i
intend
to
sail
by
the
first
ship
to
the
indian
seas
the
indian
seas
why
so--did
you
not
last
night
talk
of
thousands
of
guilders
i
did
and
they
are
there
but
amine
i
must
go--it
is
my
duty
ask
me
no
more
but
listen
to
what
i
now
propose
your
father
must
live
in
my
cottage
he
must
take
care
of
it
for
me
in
my
absence
he
will
do
me
a
favour
by
consenting
and
you
must
persuade
him
you
will
there
be
safe
he
must
also
take
care
of
my
money
for
me
i
want
it
not
at
present--i
cannot
take
it
with
me
my
father
is
not
to
be
trusted
with
the
money
of
other
people
why
does
your
father
hoard
he
cannot
take
his
money
with
him
when
he
is
called
away
it
must
be
all
for
you--and
is
not
then
my
money
safe
leave
it
then
in
my
charge
and
it
will
be
safe
but
why
need
you
go
and
risk
your
life
upon
the
water
when
you
have
such
ample
means
amine
ask
not
that
question
it
is
my
duty
as
a
son
and
more
i
cannot
tell
at
least
at
present
if
it
is
your
duty
i
ask
no
more
it
was
not
womanish
curiosity--no
no--it
was
a
better
feeling
i
assure
you
which
prompted
me
to
put
the
question
and
what
was
that
better
feeling
amine
i
hardly
know--many
good
feelings
perhaps
mixed
up
together--gratitude
esteem
respect
confidence
good-will
are
not
these
sufficient
yes
indeed
amine
and
much
to
gain
upon
so
short
an
acquaintance
but
still
i
feel
them
all
and
more
for
you
if
then
you
feel
so
much
for
me
do
oblige
me
by
persuading
your
father
to
leave
this
lonely
house
this
day
and
take
up
his
abode
in
mine
and
where
do
you
intend
to
go
yourself
if
your
father
will
not
admit
me
as
a
boarder
for
the
short
time
i
remain
here
i
will
seek
some
shelter
elsewhere
but
if
he
will
i
will
indemnify
him
well--that
is
if
you
raise
no
objection
to
my
being
for
a
few
days
in
the
house
why
should
i
our
habitation
is
no
longer
safe
and
you
offer
us
a
shelter
it
were
indeed
unjust
and
most
ungrateful
to
turn
you
out
from
beneath
your
own
roof
then
persuade
him
amine
i
will
accept
of
nothing
but
take
it
as
a
favour
for
i
should
depart
in
sorrow
if
i
saw
you
not
in
safety--will
you
promise
me
i
do
promise
to
use
my
best
endeavours--nay
i
may
as
well
say
at
once
it
shall
be
so
for
i
know
my
influence
here
is
my
hand
upon
it
will
that
content
you
philip
took
the
small
hand
extended
towards
him
his
feelings
overcame
his
discretion
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
he
looked
up
to
see
if
amine
was
displeased
and
found
her
dark
eye
fixed
upon
him
as
once
before
when
she
admitted
him
as
if
she
would
see
his
thoughts--but
the
hand
was
not
withdrawn
indeed
amine
said
philip
kissing
her
hand
once
more
you
may
confide
in
me
i
hope--i
think--nay
i
am
sure
i
may
at
last
replied
she
philip
released
her
hand
amine
returned
to
her
seat
and
for
some
time
remained
silent
and
in
a
pensive
attitude
philip
also
had
his
own
thoughts
and
did
not
open
his
lips
at
last
amine
spoke
i
think
i
have
heard
my
father
say
that
your
mother
was
very
poor--a
little
deranged
and
that
there
was
a
chamber
in
the
house
which
had
been
shut
up
for
years
it
was
shut
up
till
yesterday
and
there
you
found
your
money
did
your
mother
not
know
of
the
money
she
did
for
she
spoke
of
it
on
her
death-bed
there
must
have
been
some
potent
reasons
for
not
opening
the
chamber
there
were
what
were
they
philip
said
amine
in
a
soft
and
low
tone
of
voice
i
must
not
tell
at
least
i
ought
not
this
must
satisfy
you--'twas
the
fear
of
an
apparition
what
apparition
she
said
that
my
father
had
appeared
to
her
and
did
he
think
you
philip
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
did
but
i
can
answer
no
more
questions
amine
the
chamber
is
open
now
and
there
is
no
fear
of
his
re-appearance
i
fear
not
that
replied
amine
musing
but
continued
she
is
not
this
connected
with
your
resolution
of
going
to
sea
so
far
will
i
answer
you
that
it
has
decided
me
to
go
to
sea
but
i
pray
you
ask
no
more
it
is
painful
to
refuse
you
and
my
duty
forbids
me
to
speak
further
for
some
minutes
they
were
both
silent
when
amine
resumed--
you
were
so
anxious
to
possess
that
relic
that
i
cannot
help
thinking
it
has
connection
with
the
mystery
is
it
not
so
for
the
last
time
amine
i
will
answer
your
question--it
has
to
do
with
it
but
now
no
more
philip's
blunt
and
almost
rude
manner
of
finishing
his
speech
was
not
lost
upon
amine
who
replied--
you
are
so
engrossed
with
other
thoughts
that
you
have
not
felt
the
compliment
shown
you
by
my
taking
such
interest
about
you
sir
yes
i
do--i
feel
and
thank
you
too
amine
forgive
me
if
i
have
been
rude
but
recollect
the
secret
is
not
mine--at
least
i
feel
as
if
it
were
not
god
knows
i
wish
i
never
had
known
it
for
it
has
blasted
all
my
hopes
in
life
philip
was
silent
and
when
he
raised
his
eyes
he
found
that
amine's
were
fixed
upon
him
would
you
read
my
thoughts
amine
or
my
secret
your
thoughts
perhaps--your
secret
i
would
not
yet
do
i
grieve
that
it
should
oppress
you
so
heavily
as
evidently
it
does
it
must
indeed
be
one
of
awe
to
bear
down
a
mind
like
yours
philip
where
did
you
learn
to
be
so
brave
amine
said
philip
changing
the
conversation
circumstances
make
people
brave
or
otherwise
those
who
are
accustomed
to
difficulty
and
danger
fear
them
not
and
where
have
you
met
with
them
amine
in
the
country
where
i
was
born
not
in
this
dank
and
muddy
land
will
you
trust
me
with
the
story
of
your
former
life
amine
i
can
be
secret
if
you
wish
that
you
can
be
secret
perhaps
against
my
wish
you
have
already
proved
to
me
replied
amine
smiling
and
you
have
a
claim
to
know
something
of
the
life
you
have
preserved
i
cannot
tell
you
much
but
what
i
can
will
be
sufficient
my
father
when
a
lad
on
board
of
a
trading
vessel
was
taken
by
the
moors
and
sold
as
a
slave
to
a
hakim
or
physician
of
their
country
finding
him
very
intelligent
the
moor
brought
him
up
as
an
assistant
and
it
was
under
this
man
that
he
obtained
a
knowledge
of
the
art
in
a
few
years
he
was
equal
to
his
master
but
as
a
slave
he
worked
not
for
himself
you
know
indeed
it
cannot
be
concealed
my
father's
avarice
he
sighed
to
become
as
wealthy
as
his
master
and
to
obtain
his
freedom
he
became
a
follower
of
mahomet
after
which
he
was
free
and
practised
for
himself
he
took
a
wife
from
an
arab
family
the
daughter
of
a
chief
whom
he
had
restored
to
health
and
he
settled
in
the
country
i
was
born
he
amassed
wealth
and
became
much
celebrated
but
the
son
of
a
bey
dying
under
his
hands
was
the
excuse
for
persecuting
him
his
head
was
forfeited
but
he
escaped
not
however
without
the
loss
of
all
his
beloved
wealth
my
mother
and
i
went
with
him
he
fled
to
the
bedouins
with
whom
we
remained
some
years
there
i
was
accustomed
to
rapid
marches
wild
and
fierce
attacks
defeat
and
flight
and
oftentimes
to
indiscriminate
slaughter
but
the
bedouins
paid
not
well
for
my
father's
services
and
gold
was
his
idol
hearing
that
the
bey
was
dead
he
returned
to
cairo
where
he
again
practised
he
was
allowed
once
more
to
amass
until
the
heap
was
sufficient
to
excite
the
cupidity
of
the
new
bey
but
this
time
he
was
fortunately
made
acquainted
with
the
intentions
of
the
ruler
he
again
escaped
with
a
portion
of
his
wealth
in
a
small
vessel
and
gained
the
spanish
coast
but
he
never
has
been
able
to
retain
his
money
long
before
he
arrived
in
this
country
he
had
been
robbed
of
almost
all
and
has
now
been
for
these
three
years
laying
up
again
we
were
but
one
year
at
middleburg
and
from
thence
removed
to
this
place
such
is
the
history
of
my
life
philip
and
does
your
father
still
hold
the
mahomedan
faith
amine
i
know
not
i
think
he
holds
no
faith
whatever
at
least
he
hath
taught
me
none
his
god
is
gold
and
yours
is
the
god
who
made
this
beautiful
world
and
all
which
it
contains--
the
god
of
nature--name
him
as
you
will
this
i
feel
philip
but
more
i
fain
would
know
there
are
so
many
faiths
but
surely
they
must
be
but
different
paths
leading
alike
to
heaven
yours
is
the
christian
faith
philip
is
it
the
true
one
but
every
one
calls
his
own
the
true
one
whatever
his
creed
may
be
it
is
the
true
and
only
one
amine
could
i
but
reveal--i
have
such
dreadful
proofs--
that
your
own
faith
is
true
then
is
it
not
your
duty
to
reveal
these
proofs
tell
me
are
you
bound
by
any
solemn
obligations
never
to
reveal
no
i
am
not
yet
do
i
feel
as
if
i
were
but
i
hear
voices--it
must
be
your
father
and
the
authorities--i
must
go
down
and
meet
them
philip
rose
and
went
down
stairs
amine's
eyes
followed
him
as
he
went
and
she
remained
looking
towards
the
door
is
it
possible
said
she
sweeping
the
hair
from
off
her
brow
so
soon--yes
yes
'tis
even
so
i
feel
that
i
would
sooner
share
his
hidden
woe--his
dangers--even
death
itself
were
preferable
with
him
than
ease
and
happiness
with
any
other
and
it
shall
be
strange
indeed
if
i
do
not
this
night
my
father
shall
move
into
his
cottage
i
will
prepare
at
once
the
report
of
philip
and
mynheer
poots
was
taken
down
by
the
authorities
the
bodies
examined
and
one
or
two
of
them
recognised
as
well-known
marauders
they
were
then
removed
by
the
order
of
the
burgomaster
the
authorities
broke
up
their
council
and
philip
and
mynheer
poots
were
permitted
to
return
to
amine
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
repeat
the
conversation
which
ensued
it
will
be
sufficient
to
state
that
poots
yielded
to
the
arguments
employed
by
amine
and
philip
particularly
the
one
of
paying
no
rent
a
conveyance
for
the
furniture
and
medicines
was
procured
and
in
the
afternoon
most
of
the
effects
were
taken
away
it
was
not
however
till
dusk
that
the
strong
box
of
the
doctor
was
put
into
the
cart
and
philip
went
with
it
as
a
protector
amine
also
walked
by
the
side
of
the
vehicle
with
her
father
as
it
may
be
supposed
it
was
late
that
night
before
they
had
made
their
arrangements
and
had
retired
to
rest
this
then
is
the
chamber
which
has
so
long
been
closed
said
amine
on
entering
it
the
next
morning
long
before
philip
had
awakened
from
the
sound
sleep
produced
by
the
watching
of
the
night
before
yes
indeed
it
has
the
air
of
having
long
been
closed
amine
looked
around
her
and
then
examined
the
furniture
her
eyes
were
attracted
to
the
birdcages
she
looked
into
them--poor
little
things
continued
she
and
here
it
was
his
father
appeared
unto
his
mother
well
it
may
be
so--philip
saith
that
he
hath
proofs
and
why
should
he
not
appear
were
philip
dead
i
should
rejoice
to
see
his
spirit--at
least
it
would
be
something
what
am
i
saying--unfaithful
lips
thus
to
betray
my
secret--the
table
thrown
over--that
looks
like
the
work
of
fear
a
workbox
with
all
its
implements
scattered--only
a
woman's
fear
a
mouse
might
have
caused
all
this
and
yet
there
is
something
solemn
in
the
simple
fact
that
for
so
many
years
not
a
living
being
has
crossed
these
boards
even
that
a
table
thus
overthrown
could
so
remain
for
years
seems
scarcely
natural
and
therefore
has
its
power
on
the
mind
i
wonder
not
that
philip
feels
there
is
so
heavy
a
secret
belonging
to
this
room--but
it
must
not
remain
in
this
condition--it
must
be
occupied
at
once
amine
who
had
long
been
accustomed
to
attend
upon
her
father
and
perform
the
household
duties
now
commenced
her
intended
labours
every
part
of
the
room
and
every
piece
of
furniture
in
it
were
cleaned
even
the
cobwebs
and
dust
were
cleared
away
and
the
sofa
and
table
brought
from
the
corner
to
the
centre
of
the
room
the
melancholy
little
prisons
were
removed
and
when
amine's
work
of
neatness
was
complete
and
the
sun
shone
brightly
into
the
opened
window
the
chamber
wore
the
appearance
of
cheerfulness
amine
had
the
intuitive
good
sense
to
feel
that
strong
impressions
wear
away
when
the
objects
connected
with
them
are
removed
she
resolved
then
to
make
philip
more
at
ease
for
with
all
the
fire
and
warmth
of
blood
inherent
in
her
race
she
had
taken
his
image
to
her
heart
and
was
determined
to
win
him
again
and
again
did
she
resume
her
labour
until
the
pictures
about
the
room
and
every
other
article
looked
fresh
and
clean
not
only
the
birdcages
but
the
workbox
and
all
the
implements
were
removed
and
the
piece
of
embroidery
the
taking
up
of
which
had
made
philip
recoil
as
if
he
had
touched
an
adder
was
put
away
with
the
rest
philip
had
left
the
keys
on
the
floor
amine
opened
the
buffets
cleaned
the
glazed
doors
and
was
busy
rubbing
up
the
silver
flagons
when
her
father
came
into
the
room
mercy
on
me
exclaimed
mynheer
poots
and
is
all
that
silver--then
it
must
be
true
and
he
has
thousands
of
guilders
but
where
are
they
never
do
you
mind
father
yours
are
now
safe
and
for
that
you
have
to
thank
philip
vanderdecken
yes
very
true
but
as
he
is
to
live
here--does
he
eat
much--what
will
he
pay
me
he
ought
to
pay
well
as
he
has
so
much
money
amine's
lips
were
curled
with
a
contemptuous
smile
but
she
made
no
reply
i
wonder
where
he
keeps
his
money
and
he
is
going
to
sea
as
soon
as
he
can
get
a
ship
who
will
have
charge
of
his
money
when
he
goes
i
shall
take
charge
of
it
father
replied
amine
ah--yes--well--we
will
take
charge
of
it
the
ship
may
be
lost
no
we
will
not
take
charge
of
it
father
you
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
look
after
your
own
amine
placed
the
silver
in
the
buffets
locked
the
doors
and
took
the
keys
with
her
when
she
went
out
to
prepare
breakfast
leaving
the
old
man
gazing
through
the
glazed
doors
at
the
precious
metal
within
his
eyes
were
rivetted
upon
it
and
he
could
not
remove
them
every
minute
he
muttered
yes
all
silver
philip
came
down
stairs
and
as
he
passed
by
the
room
intending
to
go
into
the
kitchen
he
perceived
mynheer
poots
at
the
buffet
and
he
walked
into
the
room
he
was
surprised
as
well
as
pleased
with
the
alteration
he
felt
why
and
by
whom
it
was
done
and
he
was
grateful
amine
came
in
with
the
breakfast
and
their
eyes
spoke
more
than
their
lips
could
have
done
and
philip
sat
down
to
his
meal
with
less
of
sorrow
and
gloom
upon
his
brow
mynheer
poots
said
philip
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
i
intend
to
leave
you
in
possession
of
my
cottage
and
i
trust
you
will
find
yourself
comfortable
what
little
arrangements
are
necessary
i
will
confide
to
your
daughter
previous
to
my
departure
then
you
leave
us
mr
philip
to
go
to
sea
it
must
be
pleasant
to
go
and
see
strange
countries--much
better
than
staying
at
home
when
do
you
go
i
shall
leave
this
evening
for
amsterdam
replied
philip
to
make
my
arrangements
about
a
ship
but
i
shall
return
i
think
before
i
sail
ah
you
will
return
yes--you
have
your
money
and
your
goods
to
see
to
you
must
count
your
money
we
will
take
good
care
of
it
where
is
your
money
mr
vanderdecken
that
i
will
communicate
to
your
daughter
this
forenoon
before
i
leave
in
three
weeks
at
the
furthest
you
may
expect
me
back
father
said
amine
you
promised
to
go
and
see
the
child
of
the
burgomaster
it
is
time
you
went
yes
yes--by-and-by--all
in
good
time
but
i
must
wait
the
pleasure
of
mr
philip
first
he
has
much
to
tell
me
before
he
goes
philip
could
not
help
smiling
when
he
remembered
what
had
passed
when
he
first
summoned
mynheer
poots
to
the
cottage
but
the
remembrance
ended
in
sorrow
and
a
clouded
brow
amine
who
knew
what
was
passing
in
the
minds
of
both
her
father
and
philip
now
brought
her
father's
hat
and
led
him
to
the
door
of
the
cottage
and
mynheer
poots
very
much
against
his
inclination--but
never
disputing
the
will
of
his
daughter--was
obliged
to
depart
so
soon
philip
said
amine
returning
to
the
room
yes
amine
immediately
but
i
trust
to
be
back
once
more
before
i
sail
if
not
you
must
now
have
my
instructions
give
me
the
keys
philip
opened
the
cupboard
below
the
buffet
and
the
doors
of
the
iron
safe
there
amine
is
my
money
we
need
not
count
it
as
your
father
would
propose
you
see
that
i
was
right
when
i
asserted
that
i
had
thousands
of
guilders
at
present
they
are
of
no
use
to
me
as
i
have
to
learn
my
profession
should
i
return
some
day
they
may
help
me
to
own
a
ship
i
know
not
what
my
destiny
may
be
and
should
you
not
return
replied
amine
gravely
then
they
are
yours
as
well
as
all
that
is
in
this
cottage
and
the
cottage
itself
you
have
relations
have
you
not
but
one
who
is
rich--an
uncle
who
helped
us
but
little
in
our
distress
and
who
has
no
children
i
owe
him
but
little--and
he
wants
nothing
there
is
but
one
being
in
this
world
who
has
created
an
interest
in
this
heart
amine
and
it
is
you
i
wish
you
to
look
upon
me
as
a
brother
i
shall
always
love
you
as
a
dear
sister
amine
made
no
reply
philip
took
some
more
money
out
of
the
bag
which
had
been
opened
for
the
expenses
of
his
journey
and
then
locking
up
the
safe
and
cupboard
gave
the
keys
to
amine
he
was
about
to
address
her
when
there
was
a
slight
knock
at
the
door
and
in
entered
father
seysen
the
priest
save
you
my
son
and
you
my
child
whom
as
yet
i
have
not
seen
you
are
i
suppose
the
daughter
of
mynheer
poots
amine
bowed
her
head
i
perceive
philip
that
the
room
is
now
opened
and
i
have
heard
of
all
that
has
passed
i
would
now
talk
with
thee
philip
and
must
beg
this
maiden
to
leave
us
for
a
while
alone
amine
quitted
the
room
and
the
priest
sitting
down
on
the
couch
beckoned
philip
to
his
side
the
conversation
which
ensued
was
too
long
to
repeat
the
priest
first
questioned
philip
relative
to
his
secret
but
on
that
point
he
could
not
obtain
the
information
which
he
wished
philip
stated
as
much
as
he
did
to
amine
and
no
more
he
also
declared
his
intention
of
going
to
sea
and
that
should
he
not
return
he
had
bequeathed
his
property--the
extent
of
which
he
did
not
make
known--to
the
doctor
and
his
daughter
the
priest
then
made
inquiries
relative
to
mynheer
poots
asking
philip
whether
he
knew
what
his
creed
was
as
he
had
never
appeared
at
any
church
and
report
said
that
he
was
an
infidel
to
this
philip
as
usual
gave
his
frank
answer
and
intimated
that
the
daughter
at
least
was
anxious
to
be
enlightened
begging
the
priest
to
undertake
a
task
to
which
he
himself
was
not
adequate
to
this
request
father
seysen
who
perceived
the
state
of
philip's
mind
with
regard
to
amine
readily
consented
after
a
conversation
of
nearly
two
hours
they
were
interrupted
by
the
return
of
mynheer
poots
who
darted
out
of
the
room
the
instant
he
perceived
father
seysen
philip
called
amine
and
having
begged
her
as
a
favour
to
receive
the
priest's
visits
the
good
old
man
blessed
them
both
and
departed
you
did
not
give
him
any
money
mr
philip
said
mynheer
poots
when
father
seysen
had
left
the
room
i
did
not
replied
philip
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
it
no
no--it
is
better
not--for
money
is
better
than
what
he
can
give
you
but
he
must
not
come
here
why
not
father
replied
amine
if
mr
philip
wishes
it
it
is
his
own
house
o
yes
if
mr
philip
wishes
it
but
you
know
he
is
going
away
well
and
suppose
he
is--why
should
not
the
father
come
here
he
shall
come
here
to
see
me
see
you
my
child--what
can
he
want
with
you
well
then
if
he
comes
i
will
not
give
him
one
stiver--and
then
he'll
soon
go
away
philip
had
no
opportunity
of
further
converse
with
amine
indeed
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
in
an
hour
he
bade
her
farewell
in
presence
of
her
father
who
would
not
leave
them
hoping
to
obtain
from
philip
some
communication
about
the
money
which
he
was
to
leave
behind
him
in
two
days
philip
arrived
at
amsterdam
and
having
made
the
necessary
inquiries
found
that
there
was
no
chance
of
vessels
sailing
for
the
east
indies
for
some
months
the
dutch
east
india
company
had
long
been
formed
and
all
private
trading
was
at
an
end
the
company's
vessels
left
only
at
what
was
supposed
to
be
the
most
favourable
season
for
rounding
the
cape
of
storms
as
the
cape
of
good
hope
was
designated
by
the
early
adventurers
one
of
the
ships
which
were
to
sail
with
the
next
fleet
was
the
ter
schilling
a
three-masted
vessel
now
laid
up
and
unrigged
philip
found
out
the
captain
and
stated
his
wishes
to
sail
with
him
to
learn
his
profession
as
a
seaman
the
captain
was
pleased
with
his
appearance
and
as
philip
not
only
agreed
to
receive
no
wages
during
the
voyage
but
to
pay
a
premium
as
an
apprentice
learning
his
duty
he
was
promised
a
berth
on
board
as
the
second
mate
to
mess
in
the
cabin
and
he
was
told
that
he
should
be
informed
whenever
the
vessel
was
to
sail
philip
having
now
done
all
that
he
could
in
obedience
to
his
vow
determined
to
return
to
the
cottage
and
once
more
he
was
in
the
company
of
amine
we
must
now
pass
over
two
months
during
which
mynheer
poots
continued
to
labour
at
his
vocation
and
was
seldom
within
doors
and
our
two
young
friends
were
left
for
hours
together
philip's
love
for
amine
was
fully
equal
to
hers
for
him
it
was
more
than
love--it
was
a
devotion
on
both
sides
each
day
increasing
who
indeed
could
be
more
charming
more
attractive
in
all
ways
than
the
high-spirited
yet
tender
amine
occasionally
the
brow
of
philip
would
be
clouded
when
he
reflected
upon
the
dark
prospect
before
him
but
amine's
smile
would
chase
away
the
gloom
and
as
he
gazed
on
her
all
would
be
forgotten
amine
made
no
secret
of
her
attachment
it
was
shown
in
every
word
every
look
and
every
gesture
when
philip
would
take
her
hand
or
encircle
her
waist
with
his
arm
or
even
when
he
pressed
her
coral
lips
there
was
no
pretence
of
coyness
on
her
part
she
was
too
noble
too
confiding
she
felt
that
her
happiness
was
centred
in
his
love
and
she
lived
but
in
his
presence
two
months
had
thus
passed
away
when
father
seysen
who
often
called
and
had
paid
much
attention
to
amine's
instruction
one
day
came
in
as
amine
was
encircled
in
philip's
arms
my
children
said
he
i
have
watched
you
for
some
time--this
is
not
well
philip
if
you
intend
marriage
as
i
presume
you
do
still
it
is
dangerous
i
must
join
your
hands
philip
started
up
surely
i
am
not
deceived
in
thee
my
son
continued
the
priest
in
a
severe
tone
no
no
good
father
but
i
pray
you
leave
me
now
to-morrow
you
may
come
and
all
will
be
decided
but
i
must
talk
with
amine
the
priest
quitted
the
room
and
amine
and
philip
were
again
alone
the
colour
in
amine's
cheek
varied
and
her
heart
beat
for
she
felt
how
much
her
happiness
was
at
stake
the
priest
is
right
amine
said
philip
sitting
down
by
her
this
cannot
last--would
that
i
could
ever
stay
with
you
how
hard
a
fate
is
mine
you
know
i
love
the
very
ground
you
tread
upon
yet
i
dare
not
ask
thee
to
wed
to
misery
to
wed
with
thee
would
not
be
wedding
misery
philip
replied
amine
with
downcast
eyes
'twere
not
kindness
on
my
part
amine
i
should
indeed
be
selfish
i
will
speak
plainly
philip
replied
amine
you
say
you
love
me--i
know
not
how
men
love--but
this
i
know
how
i
can
love
i
feel
that
to
leave
me
now
were
indeed
unkind
and
selfish
on
your
part
for
philip
i--i
should
die
you
say
that
you
must
go
away--that
fate
demands
it--
and
your
fatal
secret
be
it
so--but
cannot
i
go
with
you
go
with
me
amine--unto
death
yes
death
for
what
is
death
but
a
release
i
fear
not
death
philip
i
fear
but
losing
thee
nay
more
is
not
your
life
in
the
hands
of
him
who
made
all
then
why
so
sure
to
die
you
have
hinted
to
me
that
you
are
chosen--selected
for
a
task--if
chosen
there
is
less
chance
of
death
for
until
the
end
be
fulfilled
if
chosen
you
must
live
i
would
i
knew
your
secret
philip
a
woman's
wit
might
serve
you
well
and
if
it
did
not
serve
you
is
there
no
comfort
no
pleasure
in
sharing
sorrow
as
well
as
joy
with
one
you
say
you
dote
upon
amine
dearest
amine
it
is
my
love
my
ardent
love
alone
which
makes
me
pause
for
o
amine
what
pleasure
should
i
feel
if
we
were
this
hour
united
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
or
what
to
do
i
could
not
withhold
my
secret
from
you
if
you
were
my
wife
nor
will
i
wed
you
till
you
know
it
well
amine
i
will
cast
my
all
upon
the
die
you
shall
know
this
secret
learn
what
a
doomed
wretch
i
am
though
from
no
fault
of
mine
and
then
you
yourself
shall
decide
but
remember
my
oath
is
registered
in
heaven
and
i
must
not
be
dissuaded
from
it
keep
that
in
mind
and
hear
my
tale--then
if
you
choose
to
wed
with
one
whose
prospects
are
so
bitter
be
it
so--a
short-lived
happiness
will
then
be
mine
but
for
you
amine--
at
once
the
secret
philip
cried
amine
impatiently
philip
then
entered
into
a
detail
of
what
our
readers
are
acquainted
with
amine
listened
in
silence
not
a
change
of
feature
was
to
be
observed
in
her
countenance
during
the
narrative
philip
wound
up
with
stating
the
oath
which
he
had
taken
i
have
done
said
philip
mournfully
'tis
a
strange
story
philip
replied
amine
and
now
hear
me--but
give
me
first
that
relic--i
wish
to
look
upon
it
and
can
there
be
such
virtue--i
had
nigh
said
such
mischief--in
this
little
thing
strange
forgive
me
philip--but
i've
still
my
doubts
upon
this
tale
of
eblis
you
know
i
am
not
yet
strong
in
the
new
belief
which
you
and
the
good
priest
have
lately
taught
me
i
do
not
say
that
it
cannot
be
true
but
still
one
so
unsettled
as
i
am
may
be
allowed
to
waver
but
philip
i'll
assume
that
all
is
true
then
if
it
be
true
without
the
oath
you
would
be
doing
but
your
duty
and
think
not
so
meanly
of
amine
as
to
suppose
she
would
restrain
you
from
what
is
right
no
philip
seek
your
father
and
if
you
can
and
he
requires
your
aid
then
save
him
but
philip
do
you
imagine
that
a
task
like
this
so
high
is
to
be
accomplished
at
one
trial
o
no
if
you
have
been
so
chosen
to
fulfil
it
you
will
be
preserved
through
difficulty
and
danger
until
you
have
worked
out
your
end
you
will
be
preserved
and
you
will
again
and
again
return--be
comforted--consoled--be
cherished--and
be
loved
by
amine
as
your
wife
and
when
it
pleases
him
to
call
you
from
this
world
your
memory
if
she
survive
you
philip
will
equally
be
cherished
in
her
bosom
philip
you
have
given
me
to
decide--dearest
philip
i
am
thine
amine
extended
her
arms
and
philip
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
that
evening
philip
demanded
his
daughter
of
the
father
and
mynheer
poots
as
soon
as
philip
opened
the
iron
safe
and
displayed
the
guilders
gave
his
immediate
consent
father
seysen
called
the
next
day
and
received
his
answer--and
three
days
afterwards
the
bells
of
the
little
church
of
terneuse
were
ringing
a
merry
peal
for
the
union
of
amine
poots
and
philip
vanderdecken
it
was
not
until
late
in
the
autumn
that
philip
was
roused
from
his
dream
of
love
for
what
alas
is
every
enjoyment
of
this
life
but
a
dream
by
a
summons
from
the
captain
of
the
vessel
with
whom
he
had
engaged
to
sail
strange
as
it
may
appear
from
the
first
day
which
put
him
in
possession
of
his
amine
philip
had
no
longer
brooded
over
his
future
destiny
occasionally
it
was
recalled
to
his
memory
but
immediately
rejected
and
for
the
time
forgotten
sufficient
he
thought
it
to
fulfil
his
engagement
when
the
time
should
come
and
though
the
hours
flew
away
and
day
succeeded
day
week
week
and
month
month
with
the
rapidity
accompanying
a
life
of
quiet
and
unvarying
bliss
philip
forgot
his
vow
in
the
arms
of
amine
who
was
careful
not
to
revert
to
a
topic
which
would
cloud
the
brow
of
her
adored
husband
once
indeed
or
twice
had
old
poots
raised
the
question
of
philip's
departure
but
the
indignant
frown
and
the
imperious
command
of
amine
who
knew
too
well
the
sordid
motives
which
actuated
her
father
and
who
at
such
times
looked
upon
him
with
abhorrence
made
him
silent
and
the
old
man
would
spend
his
leisure
hours
in
walking
up
and
down
the
parlour
with
his
eyes
riveted
upon
the
buffets
where
the
silver
tankards
now
beamed
in
all
their
pristine
brightness
one
morning
in
the
month
of
october
there
was
a
tapping
with
the
knuckles
at
the
cottage
door
as
this
precaution
implied
a
stranger
amine
obeyed
the
summons
i
would
speak
with
master
philip
vanderdecken
said
the
stranger
in
a
half-whispering
sort
of
voice
the
party
who
thus
addressed
amine
was
a
little
meagre
personage
dressed
in
the
garb
of
the
dutch
seaman
of
the
time
with
a
cap
made
of
badger-skin
hanging
over
his
brow
his
features
were
sharp
and
diminutive
his
face
of
a
deadly
white
his
lips
pale
and
his
hair
of
a
mixture
between
red
and
white
he
had
very
little
show
of
beard--
indeed
it
was
most
difficult
to
say
what
his
age
might
be
he
might
have
been
a
sickly
youth
early
sinking
into
decrepitude
or
an
old
man
hale
in
constitution
yet
carrying
no
flesh
but
the
most
important
feature
and
that
which
immediately
riveted
the
attention
of
amine
was
the
eye
of
this
peculiar
personage--for
he
had
but
one
the
right
eye-lid
was
closed
and
the
ball
within
had
evidently
wasted
away
but
his
left
eye
was
for
the
size
of
his
face
and
head
of
unusual
dimensions
very
protuberant
clear
and
watery
and
most
unpleasant
to
look
upon
being
relieved
by
no
fringe
of
eyelash
either
above
or
below
it
so
remarkable
was
the
feature
that
when
you
looked
at
the
man
you
saw
his
eye
and
looked
at
nothing
else
it
was
not
a
man
with
one
eye
but
one
eye
with
a
man
attached
to
it
the
body
was
but
the
tower
of
the
lighthouse
of
no
further
value
and
commanding
no
further
attention
than
does
the
structure
which
holds
up
the
beacon
to
the
venturous
mariner
and
yet
upon
examination
you
would
have
perceived
that
the
man
although
small
was
neatly
made
that
his
hands
were
very
different
in
texture
and
colour
from
those
of
common
seamen
that
his
features
in
general
although
sharp
were
regular
and
that
there
was
an
air
of
superiority
even
in
the
obsequious
manner
of
the
little
personage
and
an
indescribable
something
about
his
whole
appearance
which
almost
impressed
you
with
awe
amine's
dark
eyes
were
for
a
moment
fixed
upon
the
visitor
and
she
felt
a
chill
at
her
heart
for
which
she
could
not
account
as
she
requested
that
he
would
walk
in
philip
was
greatly
surprised
at
the
appearance
of
the
stranger
who
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
room
without
saying
a
word
sat
down
on
the
sofa
by
philip
in
the
place
which
amine
had
just
left
to
philip
there
was
something
ominous
in
this
person
taking
amine's
seat
all
that
had
passed
rushed
into
his
recollection
and
he
felt
that
there
was
a
summons
from
his
short
existence
of
enjoyment
and
repose
to
a
life
of
future
activity
danger
and
suffering
what
peculiarly
struck
philip
was
that
when
the
little
man
sat
beside
him
a
sensation
of
sudden
cold
ran
through
his
whole
frame
the
colour
fled
from
philip's
cheek
but
he
spoke
not
for
a
minute
or
two
there
was
a
silence
the
one-eyed
visitor
looked
round
him
and
turning
from
the
buffets
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
form
of
amine
who
stood
before
him
at
last
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
sort
of
giggle
on
the
part
of
the
stranger
which
ended
in--
philip
vanderdecken--he
he--philip
vanderdecken
you
don't
know
me
i
do
not
replied
philip
in
a
half
angry
tone
the
voice
of
the
little
man
was
most
peculiar--it
was
a
sort
of
subdued
scream
the
notes
of
which
sounded
in
your
ear
long
after
he
had
ceased
to
speak
i
am
schriften
one
of
the
pilots
of
the
ter
schilling
continued
the
man
and
i'm
come--he
he--and
he
looked
hard
at
amine--to
take
you
away
from
love--and
looking
at
the
buffets--he
he
from
comfort
and
from
this
also
cried
he
stamping
his
foot
on
the
floor
as
he
rose
from
the
sofa--from
terra
firma--he
he--to
a
watery
grave
perhaps
pleasant
continued
schriften
with
a
giggle
and
with
a
countenance
full
of
meaning
he
fixed
his
one
eye
on
philip's
face
philip's
first
impulse
was
to
put
his
new
visitor
out
of
the
door
but
amine
who
read
his
thoughts
folded
her
arms
as
she
stood
before
the
little
man
and
eyed
him
with
contempt
as
she
observed--
we
all
must
meet
our
fate
good
fellow
and
whether
by
land
or
sea
death
will
have
his
due
if
death
stare
him
in
the
face
the
cheek
of
philip
vanderdecken
will
never
turn
as
white
as
yours
is
now
indeed
replied
schriften
evidently
annoyed
at
this
cool
determination
on
the
part
of
one
so
young
and
beautiful
and
then
fixing
his
eye
upon
the
silver
shrine
of
the
virgin
on
the
mantelpiece--you
are
a
catholic
i
perceive--he
i
am
a
catholic
replied
philip
but
does
that
concern
you
when
does
the
vessel
sail
in
a
week--he
he--only
a
week
for
preparation--only
seven
days
to
leave
all--short
notice
more
than
sufficient
replied
philip
rising
up
from
the
sofa
you
may
tell
your
captain
that
i
shall
not
fail
come
amine
we
must
lose
no
time
no
indeed
replied
amine
and
our
first
duty
is
hospitality
mynheer
may
we
offer
you
refreshment
after
your
walk
this
day
week
said
schriften
addressing
philip
and
without
making
a
reply
to
amine
philip
nodded
his
head
the
little
man
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
the
room
and
in
a
short
time
was
out
of
sight
amine
sank
down
on
the
sofa
the
breaking-up
of
her
short
hour
of
happiness
had
been
too
sudden
too
abrupt
and
too
cruelly
brought
about
for
a
fondly
doting
although
heroic
woman
there
was
an
evident
malignity
in
the
words
and
manner
of
the
one-eyed
messenger
an
appearance
as
if
he
knew
more
than
others
which
awed
and
confused
both
philip
and
herself
amine
wept
not
but
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
as
philip
with
no
steady
pace
walked
up
and
down
the
small
room
again
with
all
the
vividness
of
colouring
did
the
scenes
half
forgotten
recur
to
his
memory
again
did
he
penetrate
the
fatal
chamber--again
was
it
obscure
the
embroidery
lay
at
his
feet
and
once
more
he
started
as
when
the
letter
appeared
upon
the
floor
they
had
both
awakened
from
a
dream
of
present
bliss
and
shuddered
at
the
awful
future
which
presented
itself
a
few
minutes
was
sufficient
for
philip
to
resume
his
natural
self-possession
he
sat
down
by
the
side
of
his
amine
and
clasped
her
in
his
arms
they
remained
silent
they
knew
too
well
each
other's
thoughts
and
excruciating
as
was
the
effort
they
were
both
summoning
up
their
courage
to
bear
and
steeling
their
hearts
against
the
conviction
that
in
this
world
they
must
now
expect
to
be
for
a
time
perhaps
for
ever
separated
amine
was
the
first
to
speak
removing
her
arm
which
had
been
wound
round
her
husband
she
first
put
his
hand
to
her
heart
as
if
to
compress
its
painful
throbbings
and
then
observed--
surely
that
was
no
earthly
messenger
philip
did
you
not
feel
chilled
to
death
when
he
sat
by
you
i
did
as
he
came
in
philip
who
had
the
same
thought
as
amine
but
did
not
wish
to
alarm
her
answered
confusedly--
nay
amine
you
fancy--that
is
the
suddenness
of
his
appearance
and
his
strange
conduct
have
made
you
imagine
this
but
i
saw
in
him
but
a
man
who
from
his
peculiar
deformity
has
become
an
envious
outcast
of
society--debarred
from
domestic
happiness
from
the
smiles
of
the
other
sex
for
what
woman
could
smile
upon
such
a
creature
his
bile
raised
at
so
much
beauty
in
the
arms
of
another
he
enjoyed
a
malignant
pleasure
in
giving
a
message
which
he
felt
would
break
upon
those
pleasures
from
which
he
is
cut
off
be
assured
my
love
that
it
was
nothing
more
and
even
if
my
conjecture
were
correct
what
does
it
matter
replied
amine
there
can
be
nothing
more
nothing
which
can
render
your
position
more
awful
and
more
desperate
as
your
wife
philip
i
feel
less
courage
than
i
did
when
i
gave
my
willing
hand
i
knew
not
then
what
would
be
the
extent
of
my
loss
but
fear
not
much
as
i
feel
here
continued
amine
putting
her
hand
to
her
heart--i
am
prepared
and
proud
that
he
who
is
selected
for
such
a
task
is
my
husband
amine
paused
you
cannot
surely
have
been
mistaken
philip
no
amine
i
have
not
been
mistaken
either
in
the
summons
or
in
my
own
courage
or
in
my
selection
of
a
wife
replied
philip
mournfully
as
he
embraced
her
it
is
the
will
of
heaven
then
may
its
will
be
done
replied
amine
rising
from
her
seat
the
first
pang
is
over
i
feel
better
now
philip
your
amine
knows
her
duty
philip
made
no
reply
when
after
a
few
moments
amine
continued--
but
one
short
week
philip--
i
would
it
had
been
but
one
day
replied
he
it
would
have
been
long
enough
he
has
come
too
soon--the
one-eyed
monster
nay
not
so
philip
i
thank
him
for
the
week--'tis
but
a
short
time
to
wean
myself
from
happiness
i
grant
you
that
were
i
to
teaze
to
vex
to
unman
you
with
my
tears
my
prayers
or
my
upbraidings
as
some
wives
would
do
philip
one
day
would
be
more
than
sufficient
for
such
a
scene
of
weakness
on
my
part
and
misery
on
yours
but
no
philip
your
amine
knows
her
duty
better
you
must
go
like
some
knight
of
old
to
perilous
encounter
perhaps
to
death
but
amine
will
arm
you
and
show
her
love
by
closing
carefully
each
rivet
to
protect
you
in
your
peril
and
will
see
you
depart
full
of
hope
and
confidence
anticipating
your
return
a
week
is
not
too
long
philip
when
employed
as
i
trust
i
shall
employ
it--a
week
to
interchange
our
sentiments
to
hear
your
voice
to
listen
to
your
words
each
of
which
will
be
engraven
on
my
heart's
memory
to
ponder
on
them
and
feed
my
love
with
them
is
your
absence
and
in
my
solitude
no
no
philip
i
thank
god
that
there
is
yet
a
week
and
so
do
i
then
amine
and
after
all
we
knew
that
this
must
come
yes
but
my
love
was
so
potent
that
it
banished
memory
and
yet
during
our
separation
your
love
must
feed
on
memory
amine
amine
sighed
here
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
mynheer
poots
who
struck
with
the
alteration
in
amine's
radiant
features
exclaimed
holy
prophet
what
is
the
matter
now
nothing
more
than
what
we
all
knew
before
replied
philip
i
am
about
to
leave
you--the
ship
will
sail
in
a
week
oh
you
will
sail
in
a
week
there
was
a
curious
expression
in
the
face
of
the
old
man
as
he
endeavoured
to
suppress
before
amine
and
her
husband
the
joy
which
he
felt
at
philip's
departure
gradually
he
subdued
his
features
into
gravity
and
said--
that
is
very
bad
news
indeed
no
answer
was
made
by
amine
or
philip
who
quitted
the
room
together
we
must
pass
over
this
week
which
was
occupied
in
preparations
for
philip's
departure
we
must
pass
over
the
heroism
of
amine
who
controlled
her
feelings
racked
as
she
was
with
intense
agony
at
the
idea
of
separating
from
her
adored
husband
we
cannot
dwell
upon
the
conflicting
emotions
in
the
breast
of
philip
who
left
competence
happiness
and
love
to
encounter
danger
privation
and
death
now
at
one
time
he
would
almost
resolve
to
remain
and
then
at
others
as
he
took
the
relic
from
his
bosom
and
remembered
his
vow
registered
upon
it
he
was
nearly
as
anxious
to
depart
amine
too
as
she
fell
asleep
in
her
husband's
arms
would
count
the
few
hours
left
them
or
she
would
shudder
as
she
lay
awake
and
the
wind
howled
at
the
prospect
of
what
philip
would
have
to
encounter
it
was
a
long
week
to
both
of
them
and
although
they
thought
that
time
flew
fast
it
was
almost
a
relief
when
the
morning
came
that
was
to
separate
them
for
to
their
feelings
which
from
regard
to
each
other
had
been
pent
up
and
controlled
they
could
then
give
vent
their
surcharged
bosoms
could
be
relieved
certainty
had
driven
away
suspense
and
hope
was
still
left
to
cheer
them
and
brighten
up
the
dark
horizon
of
the
future
philip
said
amine
as
they
sat
together
with
their
hands
entwined
i
shall
not
feel
so
much
when
you
are
gone
i
do
not
forget
that
all
this
was
told
me
before
we
were
wed
and
that
for
my
love
i
took
the
hazard
my
fond
heart
often
tells
me
that
you
will
return
but
it
may
deceive
me--return
you
may
but
not
in
life
in
this
room
i
shall
await
you
on
this
removed
to
its
former
station
i
shall
sit
and
if
you
cannot
appear
to
me
alive
o
refuse
me
not
if
it
be
possible
to
appear
to
me
when
dead
i
shall
fear
no
storm
no
bursting
open
of
the
window
o
no
i
shall
hail
the
presence
even
of
your
spirit
once
more
let
me
but
see
you--let
me
be
assured
that
you
are
dead--and
then
i
shall
know
that
i
have
no
more
to
live
for
in
this
world
and
shall
hasten
to
join
you
in
a
world
of
bliss
promise
me
philip
i
promise
all
you
ask
provided
heaven
will
so
permit
but
amine
and
philip's
lips
trembled
i
cannot--merciful
god
i
am
indeed
tried
amine
i
can
stay
no
longer
amine's
dark
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
husband--she
could
not
speak--her
features
were
convulsed--nature
could
no
longer
hold
up
against
her
excess
of
feeling--she
fell
into
his
arms
and
lay
motionless
philip
about
to
impress
a
last
kiss
upon
her
pale
lips
perceived
that
she
had
fainted
she
feels
not
now
said
he
as
he
laid
her
upon
the
sofa
it
is
better
that
it
should
be
so--too
soon
will
she
awake
to
misery
summoning
to
the
assistance
of
his
daughter
mynheer
poots
who
was
in
the
adjoining
room
philip
caught
up
his
hat
imprinted
one
more
fervent
kiss
upon
her
forehead
burst
from
the
house
and
was
out
of
sight
long
before
amine
had
recovered
from
her
swoon
before
we
follow
philip
vanderdecken
in
his
venturous
career
it
will
be
necessary
to
refresh
the
memory
of
our
readers
by
a
succinct
recapitulation
of
the
circumstances
that
had
directed
the
enterprise
of
the
dutch
towards
the
country
of
the
east
which
was
now
proving
to
them
a
source
of
wealth
which
they
considered
as
inexhaustible
let
us
begin
at
the
beginning
charles
the
fifth
after
having
possessed
the
major
part
of
europe
retired
from
the
world
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
and
divided
his
kingdoms
between
ferdinand
and
philip
to
ferdinand
he
gave
austria
and
its
dependencies
to
philip
spain
but
to
make
the
division
more
equal
and
palatable
to
the
latter
he
threw
the
low
countries
with
the
few
millions
vegetating
upon
them
into
the
bargain
having
thus
disposed
of
his
fellow-mortals
much
to
his
own
satisfaction
he
went
into
a
convent
reserving
for
himself
a
small
income
twelve
men
and
a
pony
whether
he
afterwards
repented
his
hobby
or
mounted
his
pony
is
not
recorded
but
this
is
certain--
that
in
two
years
he
died
philip
thought
as
many
have
thought
before
and
since
that
he
had
a
right
to
do
what
he
pleased
with
his
own
he
therefore
took
away
from
the
hollanders
most
of
their
liberties
to
make
amends
however
he
gave
them
the
inquisition
but
the
dutch
grumbled
and
philip
to
stop
their
grumbling
burnt
a
few
of
them
upon
which
the
dutch
who
are
aquatic
in
their
propensities
protested
against
a
religion
which
was
much
too
warm
for
their
constitutions
in
short
heresy
made
great
progress
and
the
duke
of
alva
was
despatched
with
a
large
army
to
prove
to
the
hollanders
that
the
inquisition
was
the
very
best
of
all
possible
arrangements
and
that
it
was
infinitely
better
that
a
man
should
be
burnt
for
half
an
hour
in
this
world
than
for
an
eternity
in
the
next
this
slight
difference
of
opinion
was
the
occasion
of
a
war
which
lasted
about
eighty
years
and
which
after
having
saved
some
hundreds
of
thousands
the
trouble
of
dying
in
their
beds
at
length
ended
in
the
seven
united
provinces
being
declared
independent--now
we
must
go
back
again
for
a
century
after
vasco
de
gama
had
discovered
the
passage
round
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
portuguese
were
interfered
with
by
other
nations
at
last
the
adventurous
spirit
of
the
english
nation
was
roused
the
passage
to
india
by
the
cape
had
been
claimed
by
the
portuguese
as
their
sole
right
they
defended
it
by
force
for
a
long
time
no
private
company
ventured
to
oppose
them
and
the
trade
was
not
of
that
apparent
value
to
induce
any
government
to
embark
in
a
war
upon
the
question
the
english
adventurers
therefore
turned
their
attention
to
the
discovery
of
a
north-west
passage
to
india
with
which
the
portuguese
could
have
no
right
to
interfere
and
in
vain
attempts
to
discover
that
passage
the
best
part
of
the
fifteenth
century
was
employed
at
last
they
abandoned
their
endeavours
and
resolved
no
longer
to
be
deterred
by
the
portuguese
pretensions
after
one
or
two
unsuccessful
expeditions
an
armament
was
fitted
out
and
put
under
the
orders
of
drake
this
courageous
and
successful
navigator
accomplished
more
than
the
most
sanguine
had
anticipated
he
returned
to
england
in
the
month
of
may
1580
after
a
voyage
which
occupied
him
nearly
three
years
bringing
home
with
him
great
riches
and
having
made
most
favourable
arrangements
with
the
king
of
the
molucca
islands
his
success
was
followed
up
by
cavendish
and
others
in
1600
the
english
east
india
company
in
the
meanwhile
received
their
first
charter
from
the
government
and
had
now
been
with
various
success
carrying
on
the
trade
for
upwards
of
fifty
years
during
the
time
that
the
dutch
were
vassals
to
the
crown
of
spain
it
was
their
custom
to
repair
to
lisbon
for
the
productions
of
the
east
and
afterwards
to
distribute
them
through
europe
but
when
they
quarrelled
with
philip
they
were
no
longer
admitted
as
retailers
of
his
indian
produce
the
consequence
was
that
while
asserting
and
fighting
for
their
independence
they
had
also
fitted
out
expeditions
to
india
they
were
successful
and
in
1602
the
various
speculators
were
by
the
government
formed
into
a
company
upon
the
same
principles
and
arrangement
as
those
which
had
been
chartered
in
england
at
the
time
therefore
to
which
we
are
reverting
the
english
and
dutch
had
been
trading
in
the
indian
seas
for
more
than
fifty
years
and
the
portuguese
had
lost
nearly
all
their
power
from
the
alliances
and
friendships
which
their
rivals
had
formed
with
the
potentates
of
the
east
who
had
suffered
from
the
portuguese
avarice
and
cruelty
whatever
may
have
been
the
sum
of
obligation
which
the
dutch
owed
to
the
english
for
the
assistance
they
received
from
them
during
their
struggle
for
independence
it
does
not
appear
that
their
gratitude
extended
beyond
the
cape
for
on
the
other
side
of
it
the
portuguese
english
and
dutch
fought
and
captured
each
other's
vessels
without
ceremony
and
there
was
no
law
but
that
of
main
force
the
mother
countries
were
occasionally
called
upon
to
interfere
but
the
interference
up
to
the
above
time
had
produced
nothing
more
than
a
paper
war
it
being
very
evident
that
all
parties
were
in
the
wrong
in
1650
cromwell
usurped
the
throne
of
england
and
the
year
afterwards
having
among
other
points
vainly
demanded
of
the
dutch
satisfaction
for
the
murder
of
his
regicide
ambassador
which
took
place
in
this
year
and
some
compensation
for
the
cruelties
exercised
on
the
english
at
amboyne
some
thirty
years
before
he
declared
war
with
holland
to
prove
that
he
was
in
earnest
he
seized
more
than
two
hundred
dutch
vessels
and
the
dutch
then
very
unwillingly
prepared
for
war
blake
and
van
tromp
met
and
the
naval
combats
were
most
obstinate
in
the
history
of
england
the
victory
is
almost
invariably
given
to
the
english
but
in
that
of
holland
to
the
dutch--by
all
accounts
these
engagements
were
so
obstinate
that
in
each
case
they
were
both
well
beaten
however
in
1654
peace
was
signed
the
dutchman
promising
to
take
his
hat
off
whenever
he
should
meet
an
englishman
on
the
high
seas--a
mere
act
of
politeness
which
mynheer
did
not
object
to
as
it
cost
nothing
and
now
having
detailed
the
state
of
things
up
to
the
time
of
philip's
embarkation
we
shall
proceed
with
our
story
as
soon
as
philip
was
clear
of
his
own
threshold
he
hastened
away
as
though
he
were
attempting
to
escape
from
his
own
painful
thoughts
in
two
days
he
arrived
at
amsterdam
where
his
first
object
was
to
procure
a
small
but
strong
steel
chain
to
replace
the
ribbon
by
which
the
relic
had
hitherto
been
secured
round
his
neck
having
done
this
he
hastened
to
embark
with
his
effects
on
board
of
the
ter
schilling
philip
had
not
forgotten
to
bring
with
him
the
money
which
he
had
agreed
to
pay
the
captain
in
consideration
of
being
received
on
board
as
an
apprentice
rather
than
a
sailor
he
had
also
furnished
himself
with
a
further
sum
for
his
own
exigencies
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
he
arrived
on
board
of
the
ter
schilling
which
lay
at
single
anchor
surrounded
by
the
other
vessels
composing
the
indian
fleet
the
captain
whose
name
was
kloots
received
him
with
kindness
showed
him
his
berth
and
then
went
below
in
the
hold
to
decide
a
question
relative
to
the
cargo
leaving
philip
on
deck
to
his
own
reflections
and
this
then
thought
philip
as
he
leaned
against
the
taffrail
and
looked
forward--this
then
is
the
vessel
in
which
my
first
attempt
is
to
be
made
first
and--perhaps
last
how
little
do
those
with
whom
i
am
about
to
sail
imagine
the
purport
of
my
embarkation
how
different
are
my
views
from
those
of
others
do
i
seek
a
fortune
no
is
it
to
satisfy
curiosity
and
a
truant
spirit
no
i
seek
communion
with
the
dead
can
i
meet
the
dead
without
danger
to
myself
and
these
who
sail
with
me
i
should
think
not
for
i
cannot
join
it
but
in
death
did
they
surmise
my
wishes
and
intentions
would
they
permit
me
to
remain
one
hour
on
board
superstitious
as
seamen
are
said
to
be
they
might
find
a
good
excuse
if
they
knew
my
mission
not
only
for
their
superstition
but
for
ridding
themselves
of
one
on
such
an
awful
errand
awful
indeed
and
how
to
be
accomplished
heaven
alone
with
perseverance
on
my
part
can
solve
the
mystery
and
philip's
thoughts
reverted
to
his
amine
he
folded
his
arms
and
entranced
in
meditation
with
his
eyes
raised
to
the
firmament
he
appeared
to
watch
the
flying
scud
had
you
not
better
go
below
said
a
mild
voice
which
made
philip
start
from
his
reverie
it
was
that
of
the
first
mate
whose
name
was
hillebrant
a
short
well-set
man
of
about
thirty
years
of
age
his
hair
was
flaxen
and
fell
in
long
flakes
upon
his
shoulders
his
complexion
fair
and
his
eyes
of
a
soft
blue
although
there
was
little
of
the
sailor
in
his
appearance
few
knew
or
did
their
duty
better
i
thank
you
replied
philip
i
had
indeed
forgotten
myself
and
where
i
was
my
thoughts
were
far
away
good
night
and
many
thanks
the
ter
schilling
like
most
of
the
vessels
of
that
period
was
very
different
in
her
build
and
fitting
from
those
of
the
present
day
she
was
ship-rigged
and
of
about
four
hundred
tons
burden
her
bottom
was
nearly
flat
and
her
sides
fell
in
as
she
rose
above
the
water
so
that
her
upper
decks
were
not
half
the
width
of
the
hold
all
the
vessels
employed
by
the
company
being
armed
she
had
her
main
deck
clear
of
goods
and
carried
six
nine-pounders
on
each
broadside
her
ports
were
small
and
oval
there
was
a
great
spring
in
all
her
decks--that
is
to
say
she
ran
with
a
curve
forward
and
aft
on
her
forecastle
another
small
deck
ran
from
the
knight-heads
which
was
called
the
top-gallant
forecastle
her
quarter-deck
was
broken
with
a
poop
which
rose
high
out
of
the
water
the
bowsprit
staved
very
much
and
was
to
appearance
almost
as
a
fourth
mast
the
more
so
as
she
carried
a
square
spritsail
and
sprit-topsail
on
her
quarter-deck
and
poop-bulwarks
were
fixed
in
sockets
implements
of
warfare
now
long
in
disuse
but
what
were
then
known
by
the
names
of
cohorns
and
patteraroes
they
turned
round
on
a
swivel
and
were
pointed
by
an
iron
handle
fixed
to
the
breech
the
sail
abaft
the
mizzen-mast
corresponding
to
the
driver
or
spanker
of
the
present
day
was
fixed
upon
a
lateen-yard
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
after
this
description
that
the
dangers
of
a
long
voyage
were
not
a
little
increased
by
the
peculiar
structure
of
the
vessels
which
although
with
such
top
hamper
and
so
much
wood
above
water
they
could
make
good
way
before
a
favourable
breeze
could
hold
no
wind
and
had
but
little
chance
if
caught
upon
a
lee-shore
the
crew
of
the
ter
schilling
was
composed
of
the
captain
two
mates
two
pilots
and
forty-five
men
the
supercargo
had
not
yet
come
on
board
the
cabin
under
the
poop
was
appropriated
to
the
supercargo
but
the
main-deck
cabin
to
the
captain
and
mates
who
composed
the
whole
of
the
cabin
mess
when
philip
awoke
the
next
morning
he
found
that
the
topsails
were
hoisted
and
the
anchor
short-stay
apeak
some
of
the
other
vessels
of
the
fleet
were
under
weigh
and
standing
out
the
weather
was
fine
and
the
water
smooth
and
the
bustle
and
novelty
of
the
scene
were
cheering
to
his
spirits
the
captain
mynheer
kloots
was
standing
on
the
poop
with
a
small
telescope
made
of
pasteboard
to
his
eye
anxiously
looking
towards
the
town
mynheer
kloots
as
usual
had
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
the
smoke
which
he
puffed
from
it
for
time
obscured
the
lenses
of
his
telescope
philip
went
up
the
poop
ladder
and
saluted
him
mynheer
kloots
was
a
person
of
no
moderate
dimensions
and
the
quantity
of
garments
which
he
wore
added
no
little
to
his
apparent
bulk
the
outer
garments
exposed
to
view
were
a
rough
fox-skin
cap
upon
his
head
from
under
which
appeared
the
edge
of
a
red
worsted
nightcap
a
red
plush
waistcoat
with
large
metal
buttons
a
jacket
of
green
cloth
over
which
he
wore
another
of
larger
dimensions
of
coarse
blue
cloth
which
came
down
as
low
as
what
would
be
called
a
spencer
below
he
had
black
plush
breeches
light-blue
worsted
stockings
shoes
and
broad
silver
buckles
round
his
waist
was
girded
with
a
broad
belt
a
canvas
apron
which
descended
in
thick
folds
nearly
to
his
knee
in
his
belt
was
a
large
broad-bladed
knife
in
a
sheath
of
shark's
skin
such
was
the
attire
of
mynheer
kloots
captain
of
the
ter
schilling
he
was
as
tall
as
he
was
corpulent
his
face
was
oval
and
his
features
small
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
his
frame
his
grizzly
hair
fluttered
in
the
breeze
and
his
nose
although
quite
straight
was
at
the
tip
fiery
red
from
frequent
application
to
his
bottle
of
schnapps
and
the
heat
of
a
small
pipe
which
seldom
left
his
lips
except
for
him
to
give
an
order
or
for
it
to
be
replenished
good
morning
my
son
said
the
captain
taking
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
for
a
moment
we
are
detained
by
the
supercargo
who
appears
not
over-willing
to
come
on
board
the
boat
has
been
on
shore
this
hour
waiting
for
him
and
we
shall
be
last
of
the
fleet
under
weigh
i
wish
the
company
would
let
us
sail
without
these
gentlemen
who
are
in
my
opinion
a
great
hinderance
to
business
but
they
think
otherwise
on
shore
what
is
their
duty
on
board
replied
philip
their
duty
is
to
look
after
the
cargo
and
the
traffic
and
if
they
kept
to
that
it
would
not
be
so
bad
but
they
interfere
with
everything
else
and
everybody
studying
little
except
their
own
comforts
in
fact
they
play
the
king
on
board
knowing
that
we
dare
not
affront
them
as
a
word
from
them
would
prejudice
the
vessel
when
again
to
be
chartered
the
company
insist
upon
their
being
received
with
all
honours
we
salute
with
five
guns
on
their
arrival
on
board
do
you
know
anything
of
this
one
whom
you
expect
nothing
but
from
report
a
brother
captain
of
mine
with
whom
he
has
sailed
told
me
that
he
is
most
fearful
of
the
dangers
of
the
sea
and
much
taken
up
with
his
own
importance
i
wish
he
would
come
replied
philip
i
am
most
anxious
that
we
should
sail
you
must
be
of
a
wandering
disposition
my
son
i
hear
that
you
leave
a
comfortable
home
and
a
pretty
wife
to
boot
i
am
most
anxious
to
see
the
world
replied
philip
and
i
must
learn
to
sail
a
ship
before
i
purchase
one
and
try
to
make
the
fortune
that
i
covet
alas
how
different
from
my
real
wishes
thought
philip
as
he
made
this
reply
fortunes
are
made
and
fortunes
are
swallowed
up
too
by
the
ocean
replied
the
captain
if
i
could
turn
this
good
ship
into
a
good
house
with
plenty
of
guilders
to
keep
the
house
warm
you
would
not
find
me
standing
on
this
poop
i
have
doubled
the
cape
twice
which
is
often
enough
for
any
man
the
third
time
may
not
be
so
lucky
is
it
so
dangerous
then
said
philip
as
dangerous
as
tides
and
currents
rocks
and
sand-banks
hard
gales
and
heavy
seas
can
make
it--no
more
even
when
you
anchor
in
the
bay
on
this
side
of
the
cape
you
ride
in
fear
and
trembling
for
you
may
be
blown
away
from
your
anchor
to
sea
or
be
driven
on
shore
among
the
savages
before
the
men
can
well
put
on
their
clothing
but
when
once
you're
well
on
the
other
side
of
the
cape
then
the
water
dances
to
the
beams
of
the
sun
as
if
it
were
merry
and
you
may
sail
for
weeks
with
a
cloudless
sky
and
a
following
breeze
without
starting
tack
or
sheet
or
having
to
take
your
pipe
out
of
your
mouth
what
ports
shall
we
go
into
mynheer
of
that
i
can
say
but
little
gambroon
in
the
gulf
of
persia
will
probably
be
the
first
rendezvous
of
the
whole
fleet
then
we
shall
separate
some
will
sail
direct
for
bantam
in
the
island
of
java
others
will
have
orders
to
trade
down
the
straits
for
camphor
gum
benzoin
and
wax
they
have
also
gold
and
the
teeth
of
the
elephant
to
barter
with
us
there
should
we
be
sent
thither
you
must
be
careful
with
the
natives
mynheer
vanderdecken
they
are
fierce
and
treacherous
and
their
curved
knives
or
creeses
as
they
call
them
are
sharp
and
deadly
poisoned
i
have
had
hard
fighting
in
those
straits
both
with
portuguese
and
english
but
we
are
all
at
peace
now
true
my
son
but
when
round
the
cape
we
must
not
trust
to
papers
signed
at
home
and
the
english
press
us
hard
and
tread
upon
our
heels
wherever
we
go
they
must
be
checked
and
i
suspect
our
fleet
is
so
large
and
well
appointed
in
expectation
of
hostilities
how
long
do
you
expect
your
voyage
may
occupy
us
that's
as
may
be
but
i
should
say
about
two
years--nay
if
not
detained
by
the
factors
as
i
expect
we
shall
be
for
some
hostile
service
it
may
be
less
two
years
thought
philip
two
years
from
amine
and
he
sighed
deeply
for
he
felt
that
their
separation
might
be
for
ever
nay
my
son
two
years
is
not
so
long
said
mynheer
kloots
who
observed
the
passing
cloud
on
philip's
brow
i
was
once
five
years
away
and
was
unfortunate
for
i
brought
home
nothing
not
even
my
ship
i
was
sent
to
chittagong
on
the
east
side
of
the
great
bay
of
bengala
and
lay
for
three
months
in
the
river
the
chiefs
of
the
country
would
detain
me
by
force
they
would
not
barter
for
my
cargo
or
permit
me
to
seek
another
market
my
powder
had
been
landed
and
i
could
make
no
resistance
the
worms
ate
through
the
bottom
of
my
vessel
and
she
sank
at
her
anchors
they
knew
it
would
take
place
and
that
then
they
would
have
my
cargo
at
their
own
price
another
vessel
brought
us
home
had
i
not
been
so
treacherously
served
i
should
have
had
no
need
to
sail
this
time
and
now
my
gains
are
small
the
company
forbidding
all
private
trading
but
here
he
comes
at
last
they
have
hoisted
the
ensign
on
the
staff
in
the
boat
there--they
have
shoved
off
mynheer
hillebrant
see
the
gunners
ready
with
their
linstocks
to
salvo
the
supercargo
what
duty
do
you
wish
me
to
perform
observed
philip
in
what
can
i
be
useful
at
present
you
can
be
of
little
use
except
in
those
heavy
gales
in
which
every
pair
of
hands
is
valuable
you
must
look
and
learn
for
some
time
yet
but
you
can
make
a
fair
copy
of
the
journal
kept
for
the
inspection
of
the
company
and
may
assist
me
in
various
ways
as
soon
as
the
unpleasant
nausea
felt
by
those
who
first
embark
has
subsided
as
a
remedy
i
should
propose
that
you
gird
a
handkerchief
tight
round
your
body
so
as
to
compress
the
stomach
and
make
frequent
application
of
my
bottle
of
schnapps
which
you
will
find
always
at
your
service
but
now
to
receive
the
factor
of
the
most
puissant
company
mynheer
hillebrant
let
them
discharge
the
cannon
the
guns
were
fired
and
soon
after
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
the
boat
with
its
long
ensign
trailing
on
the
water
was
pulled
alongside
philip
watched
the
appearance
of
the
supercargo--but
he
remained
in
the
boat
until
several
of
the
boxes
with
the
initials
and
arms
of
the
company
were
first
handed
on
the
deck
at
last
the
supercargo
appeared
he
was
a
small
spare
wizen-faced
man
with
a
three-cornered
cocked-hat
bound
with
broad
gold
lace
upon
his
head
under
which
appeared
a
full-bottomed
flowing
wig
the
curls
of
which
descended
low
upon
his
shoulders
his
coat
was
of
crimson
velvet
with
broad
flaps
his
waistcoat
of
white
silk
worked
in
coloured
flowers
and
descending
half-way
down
to
his
knees
his
breeches
were
of
black
satin
and
his
legs
were
covered
with
white
silk
stockings
add
to
this
gold
buckles
at
his
knees
and
in
his
shoes
lace
ruffles
to
his
wrists
and
a
silver-mounted
cane
in
his
hand
and
the
reader
has
the
entire
dress
of
mynheer
jacob
janz
von
stroom
the
supercargo
of
the
honourable
company
appointed
to
the
good
ship
ter
schilling
as
he
looked
round
him
surrounded
at
a
respectful
distance
by
the
captain
officers
and
men
of
the
ship
with
their
caps
in
their
hands
the
reader
might
be
reminded
of
the
picture
of
the
monkey
who
had
seen
the
world
surrounded
by
his
tribe
there
was
not
however
the
least
inclination
on
the
part
of
the
seamen
to
laugh
even
at
his
flowing
full-bottomed
wig
respect
was
at
that
period
paid
to
dress
and
although
mynheer
von
stroom
could
not
be
mistaken
for
a
sailor
he
was
known
to
be
the
supercargo
of
the
company
and
a
very
great
man
he
therefore
received
all
the
respect
due
to
so
important
a
personage
mynheer
von
stroom
did
not
however
appear
very
anxious
to
remain
on
deck
he
requested
to
be
shown
into
his
cabin
and
followed
the
captain
aft
picking
his
way
among
the
coils
of
ropes
with
which
his
path
was
encumbered
the
door
was
opened
and
the
supercargo
disappeared
the
ship
was
then
got
under
weigh
the
men
had
left
the
windlass
the
sails
had
been
trimmed
and
they
were
securing
the
anchor
on
board
when
the
bell
of
the
poop-cabin
appropriated
to
the
supercargo
was
pulled
with
great
violence
what
can
that
be
said
mynheer
kloots
who
was
forward
taking
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
mynheer
vanderdecken
will
you
see
what
is
the
matter
philip
went
aft
as
the
pealing
of
the
bell
continued
and
opening
the
cabin
door
discovered
the
supercargo
perched
upon
the
table
and
pulling
the
bell-rope
which
hung
over
its
centre
with
every
mark
of
fear
in
his
countenance
his
wig
was
off
and
his
bare
skull
gave
him
an
appearance
peculiarly
ridiculous
what
is
the
matter
sir
inquired
philip
matter
spluttered
mynheer
von
stroom--call
the
troops
in
with
their
firelocks
quick
sir
am
i
to
be
murdered
torn
to
pieces
and
devoured
for
mercy's
sake
sir
don't
stare
but
do
something--look
it's
coming
to
the
table
o
dear
o
dear
continued
the
supercargo
evidently
terrified
out
of
his
wits
philip
whose
eyes
had
been
fixed
on
mynheer
von
stroom
turned
them
in
the
direction
pointed
out
and
much
to
his
astonishment
perceived
a
small
bear
upon
the
deck
who
was
amusing
himself
with
the
supercargo's
flowing
wig
which
he
held
in
his
paws
tossing
it
about
and
now
and
then
burying
his
muzzle
in
it
the
unexpected
sight
of
the
animal
was
at
first
a
shock
to
philip
but
a
moment's
consideration
assured
him
that
the
animal
must
be
harmless
or
it
never
would
have
been
permitted
to
remain
loose
in
the
vessel
nevertheless
philip
had
no
wish
to
approach
the
animal
whose
disposition
he
was
unacquainted
with
when
the
appearance
of
mynheer
kloots
put
an
end
to
his
difficulty
what
is
the
matter
mynheer
said
the
captain
o
i
see
it
is
johannes
continued
the
captain
going
up
to
the
bear
and
saluting
him
with
a
kick
as
he
recovered
the
supercargo's
wig
out
of
the
cabin
johannes
out
sir
cried
mynheer
kloots
kicking
the
breech
of
the
bear
till
the
animal
had
escaped
through
the
door
mynheer
von
stroom
i
am
very
sorry--here
is
your
wig
shut
the
door
mynheer
vanderdecken
or
the
beast
may
come
back
for
he
is
very
fond
of
me
as
soon
the
door
was
shut
between
mynheer
von
stroom
and
the
object
of
his
terror
the
little
man
slid
off
the
table
to
the
high-backed
chair
near
it
shook
out
the
damaged
curls
of
his
wig
and
replaced
it
on
his
head
pulled
out
his
ruffles
and
assuming
an
air
of
magisterial
importance
struck
his
cane
on
the
deck
and
then
spoke
mynheer
kloots
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
disrespect
to
the
supercargo
of
the
puissant
company
god
in
heaven
no
disrespect
mynheer--the
animal
is
a
bear
as
you
see
he
is
very
tame
even
with
strangers
he
belongs
to
me
i
have
had
him
since
he
was
three
months
old
it
was
all
a
mistake
the
mate
mynheer
hillebrant
put
him
in
the
cabin
that
he
might
be
out
of
the
way
while
the
duty
was
carrying
on
and
he
quite
forgot
that
he
was
here
i
am
very
sorry
mynheer
von
stroom
but
he
will
not
come
here
again
unless
you
wish
to
play
with
him
play
with
him
i
supercargo
to
the
company
play
with
a
bear
mynheer
kloots
the
animal
must
be
thrown
overboard
immediately
nay
nay
i
cannot
throw
overboard
an
animal
that
i
hold
in
much
affection
mynheer
von
stroom
but
he
shall
not
trouble
you
then
captain
kloots
you
will
have
to
deal
with
the
company
to
whom
i
shall
represent
this
affair
your
charter
will
be
cancelled
and
your
freight-money
will
be
forfeited
kloots
was
like
most
dutchmen
not
a
little
obstinate
and
this
imperative
behaviour
on
the
part
of
the
supercargo
raised
his
bile
there
is
nothing
in
the
charter
that
prevents
my
having
an
animal
on
board
replied
kloots
by
the
regulations
of
the
company
replied
von
stroom
falling
back
in
his
chair
with
an
important
air
and
crossing
his
thin
legs
you
are
required
to
receive
on
board
strange
and
curious
animals
sent
home
by
the
governors
and
factors
to
be
presented
to
crowned
heads--such
as
lions
tigers
elephants
and
other
productions
of
the
east--but
in
no
instance
is
it
permitted
to
the
commanders
of
chartered
ships
to
receive
on
board
on
their
own
account
animals
of
any
description
which
must
be
considered
under
the
head
and
offence
of
private
trading
my
bear
is
not
for
sale
mynheer
von
stroom
it
must
immediately
be
sent
out
of
the
ship
mynheer
kloots
i
order
you
to
send
it
away--on
your
peril
to
refuse
then
we
will
drop
the
anchor
again
mynheer
von
stroom
and
send
on
shore
to
head-quarters
to
decide
the
point
if
the
company
insists
that
the
brute
be
put
on
shore
be
it
so
but
recollect
mynheer
von
stroom
we
shall
lose
the
protection
of
the
fleet
and
have
to
sail
alone
shall
i
drop
the
anchor
mynheer
this
observation
softened
down
the
pertinacity
of
the
supercargo
he
had
no
wish
to
sail
alone
and
the
fear
of
this
contingency
was
more
powerful
than
the
fear
of
the
bear
mynheer
kloots
i
will
not
be
too
severe
if
the
animal
is
chained
so
that
it
does
not
approach
me
i
will
consent
to
its
remaining
on
board
i
will
keep
it
out
of
your
way
as
much
as
i
can
but
as
for
chaining
up
the
poor
animal
it
will
howl
all
day
and
night
and
you
will
have
no
sleep
mynheer
von
stroom
replied
kloots
the
supercargo
who
perceived
that
the
captain
was
positive
and
that
his
threats
were
disregarded
did
all
that
a
man
could
do
who
could
not
help
himself
he
vowed
vengeance
in
his
own
mind
and
then
with
an
air
of
condescension
observed--upon
those
conditions
mynheer
kloots
your
animal
may
remain
on
board
mynheer
kloots
and
philip
then
left
the
cabin
the
former
who
was
in
no
very
good
humour
muttering
as
he
walked
away--if
the
company
send
their
monkeys
on
board
i
think
i
may
well
have
my
bear
and
pleased
with
his
joke
mynheer
kloots
recovered
his
good
humour
we
must
allow
the
indian
fleet
to
pursue
its
way
to
the
cape
with
every
variety
of
wind
and
weather
some
had
parted
company
but
the
rendezvous
was
table
bay
from
which
they
were
again
to
start
together
philip
vanderdecken
was
soon
able
to
render
some
service
on
board
he
studied
his
duty
diligently
for
employment
prevented
him
from
dwelling
too
much
upon
the
cause
of
his
embarkation
and
he
worked
hard
at
the
duties
of
the
ship
for
the
exercise
procured
for
him
that
sleep
which
otherwise
would
have
been
denied
he
was
soon
a
favourite
of
the
captain
and
intimate
with
hillebrant
the
first
mate
the
second
mate
struys
was
a
morose
young
man
with
whom
he
had
little
intercourse
as
for
the
supercargo
mynheer
jacob
janz
von
stroom
he
seldom
ventured
out
of
his
cabin
the
bear
johannes
was
not
confined
and
therefore
mynheer
von
stroom
confined
himself
hardly
a
day
passed
that
he
did
not
look
over
a
letter
which
he
had
framed
upon
the
subject
all
ready
to
forward
to
the
company
and
each
time
that
he
perused
it
he
made
some
alteration
which
he
considered
would
give
additional
force
to
his
complaint
and
would
prove
still
more
injurious
to
the
interests
of
captain
kloots
in
the
mean
time
in
happy
ignorance
of
all
that
was
passing
in
the
poop-cabin
mynheer
kloots
smoked
his
pipe
drank
his
schnapps
and
played
with
johannes
the
animal
had
also
contracted
a
great
affection
for
philip
and
used
to
walk
the
watch
with
him
there
was
another
party
in
the
ship
whom
we
must
not
lose
sight
of--the
one-eyed
pilot
schriften
who
appeared
to
have
imbibed
a
great
animosity
towards
our
hero
as
well
as
to
his
dumb
favourite
the
bear
as
philip
held
the
rank
of
an
officer
schriften
dared
not
openly
affront
though
he
took
every
opportunity
of
annoying
him
and
was
constantly
inveighing
against
him
before
the
ship's
company
to
the
bear
he
was
more
openly
inveterate
and
seldom
passed
it
without
bestowing
upon
it
a
severe
kick
accompanied
with
a
horrid
curse
although
no
one
on
board
appeared
to
be
fond
of
this
man
everybody
appeared
to
be
afraid
of
him
and
he
had
obtained
a
control
over
the
seamen
which
appeared
unaccountable
such
was
the
state
of
affairs
on
board
the
good
ship
ter
schilling
when
in
company
with
two
others
she
lay
becalmed
about
two
days'
sail
to
the
cape
the
weather
was
intensely
hot
for
it
was
the
summer
in
those
southern
latitudes
and
philip
who
had
been
lying
down
under
the
awning
spread
over
the
poop
was
so
overcome
with
the
heat
that
he
had
fallen
asleep
he
awoke
with
a
shivering
sensation
of
cold
over
his
whole
body
particularly
at
his
chest
and
half-opening
his
eyes
he
perceived
the
pilot
schriften
leaning
over
him
and
holding
between
his
finger
and
his
thumb
a
portion
of
the
chain
which
had
not
been
concealed
and
to
which
was
attached
the
sacred
relic
philip
closed
them
again
to
ascertain
what
were
the
man's
intentions
he
found
that
he
gradually
dragged
out
the
chain
and
when
the
relic
was
clear
attempted
to
pass
the
whole
over
his
head
evidently
to
gain
possession
of
it
upon
this
attempt
philip
started
up
and
seized
him
by
the
waist
indeed
cried
philip
with
an
indignant
look
as
he
released
the
chain
from
the
pilot's
hand
but
schriften
appeared
not
in
the
least
confused
at
being
detected
in
his
attempt
looking
with
his
malicious
one
eye
at
philip
he
mockingly
observed--
does
that
chain
hold
her
picture--he
he
vanderdecken
rose
pushed
him
away
and
folded
his
arms
i
advise
you
not
to
be
quite
so
curious
master
pilot
or
you
may
repent
it
or
perhaps
continued
the
pilot
quite
regardless
of
philip's
wrath
it
may
be
a
child's
caul
a
sovereign
remedy
against
drowning
go
forward
to
your
duty
sir
cried
philip
or
as
you
are
a
catholic
the
finger-nail
of
a
saint
or
yes
i
have
it--a
piece
of
the
holy
cross
philip
started
that's
it
that's
it
cried
schriften
who
now
went
forward
to
where
the
seamen
were
standing
at
the
gangway
news
for
you
my
lads
said
he
we've
a
bit
of
the
holy
cross
aboard
and
so
we
may
defy
the
devil
philip
hardly
knowing
why
had
followed
schriften
as
he
descended
the
poop-ladder
and
was
forward
on
the
quarterdeck
when
the
pilot
made
this
remark
to
the
seamen
ay
ay
replied
an
old
seaman
to
the
pilot
not
only
the
devil
but
the
flying
dutchman
to
boot
flying
dutchman
thought
philip
can
that
refer
to--
and
philip
walked
a
step
or
two
forward
so
as
to
conceal
himself
behind
the
mainmast
hoping
to
obtain
some
information
should
they
continue
the
conversation
in
this
he
was
not
disappointed
they
say
that
to
meet
with
him
is
worse
than
meeting
with
the
devil
observed
another
of
the
crew
who
ever
saw
him
said
another
he
has
been
seen
that's
sartain
and
just
as
sartain
that
ill
luck
follows
the
vessel
that
falls
in
with
him
and
where
is
he
to
be
fallen
in
with
o
they
say
that's
not
so
sartain--but
he
cruises
off
the
cape
i
should
like
to
know
the
whole
long
and
short
of
the
story
said
a
third
i
can
only
tell
what
i've
heard
it's
a
doomed
vessel
they
were
pirates
and
cut
the
captain's
throat
i
believe
no
no
cried
schriften
the
captain
is
in
her
now--and
a
villain
he
was
they
say
that
like
somebody
else
on
board
of
us
now
he
left
a
very
pretty
wife
and
that
he
was
very
fond
of
her
how
do
they
know
that
pilot
because
he
always
wants
to
send
letters
home
when
he
boards
vessels
that
he
falls
in
with
but
woe
to
the
vessel
that
takes
charge
of
them--she
is
sure
to
be
lost
with
every
soul
on
board
i
wonder
where
you
heard
all
this
said
one
of
the
men
did
you
ever
see
the
vessel
yes
i
did
screamed
schriften
but
as
if
recovering
himself
his
scream
subsided
into
his
usual
giggle
and
he
added
but
we
need
not
fear
her
boys
we've
a
bit
of
the
true
cross
on
board
schriften
then
walked
aft
as
if
to
avoid
being
questioned
when
he
perceived
philip
by
the
mainmast
so
i'm
not
the
only
one
curious--he
he
pray
did
you
bring
that
on
board
in
case
we
should
fall
in
with
the
flying
dutchman
i
fear
no
flying
dutchman
replied
philip
confused
now
i
think
of
it
you
are
of
the
same
name
at
least
they
say
that
his
name
was
vanderdecken--eh
there
are
many
vanderdeckens
in
the
world
besides
me
replied
philip
who
had
recovered
his
composure
and
having
made
this
reply
he
walked
away
to
the
poop
of
the
vessel
one
would
almost
imagine
this
malignant
one-eyed
wretch
was
aware
of
the
cause
of
my
embarkation
mused
philip
but
no
that
cannot
be
why
do
i
feel
such
a
chill
whenever
he
approaches
me
i
wonder
if
others
do
or
whether
it
is
a
mere
fancy
on
the
part
of
amine
and
myself
i
dare
ask
no
questions--strange
too
that
the
man
should
feel
such
malice
towards
me
i
never
injured
him
what
i
have
just
overheard
confirms
all
but
there
needed
no
confirmation
oh
amine
amine
but
for
thee
and
i
would
rejoice
to
solve
this
riddle
at
the
expense
of
life
god
in
mercy
check
the
current
of
my
brain
muttered
philip
or
my
reason
cannot
hold
its
seat
in
three
days
the
ter
schilling
and
her
consorts
arrived
at
table
bay
where
they
found
the
remainder
of
the
fleet
at
anchor
waiting
for
them
just
at
that
period
the
dutch
had
formed
a
settlement
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
where
the
indian
fleets
used
to
water
and
obtain
cattle
from
the
hottentot
tribes
who
lived
on
the
coast
and
who
for
a
brass
button
or
a
large
nail
would
willingly
offer
a
fat
bullock
a
few
days
were
occupied
in
completing
the
water
of
the
squadron
and
then
the
ships
having
received
from
the
admiral
their
instructions
as
to
rendezvous
in
case
of
parting
company
and
made
every
preparation
for
the
bad
weather
which
they
anticipated
again
weighed
their
anchors
and
proceeded
on
their
voyage
for
three
days
they
beat
against
light
and
baffling
winds
making
but
little
progress
on
the
third
the
breeze
sprang
up
strong
from
the
southward
until
it
increased
to
a
gale
and
the
fleet
were
blown
down
to
the
northward
of
the
bay
on
the
seventh
day
the
ter
schilling
found
herself
alone
but
the
weather
had
moderated
sail
was
again
made
upon
the
vessel
and
her
head
put
to
the
eastward
that
she
might
run
in
for
the
land
we
are
unfortunate
in
thus
parting
with
all
our
consorts
observed
mynheer
kloots
to
philip
as
they
were
standing
at
the
gangway
but
it
must
be
near
meridian
and
the
sun
will
enable
me
to
discover
our
latitude
it
is
difficult
to
say
how
far
we
may
have
been
swept
by
the
gale
and
the
currents
to
the
northward
boy
bring
up
my
cross-staff
and
be
mindful
that
you
do
not
strike
it
against
anything
as
you
come
up
the
cross-staff
at
that
time
was
the
simple
instrument
used
to
discover
the
latitude
which
it
would
give
to
a
nice
observer
to
within
five
or
ten
miles
quadrants
and
sextants
were
the
invention
of
a
much
later
period
indeed
considering
that
they
had
so
little
knowledge
of
navigation
and
the
variation
of
the
compass
and
that
their
easting
and
westing
could
only
be
computed
by
dead
reckoning
it
is
wonderful
how
our
ancestors
traversed
the
ocean
in
the
way
they
did
with
comparatively
so
few
accidents
we
are
full
three
degrees
to
the
northward
of
the
cape
observed
mynheer
kloots
after
he
had
computed
his
latitude
the
currents
must
be
running
strong
the
wind
is
going
down
fast
and
we
shall
have
a
change
if
i
mistake
not
towards
the
evening
it
fell
calm
with
a
heavy
swell
setting
towards
the
shore
shoals
of
seals
appeared
on
the
surface
following
the
vessel
as
she
drove
before
the
swell
the
fish
darted
and
leaped
in
every
direction
and
the
ocean
around
them
appeared
to
be
full
of
life
as
the
sun
slowly
descended
to
the
horizon
what
is
that
noise
we
hear
observed
philip
it
sounds
like
distant
thunder
i
hear
it
replied
mynheer
kloots
aloft
there
do
you
see
the
land
yes
replied
the
man
after
a
pause
in
ascending
the
topmast
shrouds
it
is
right
ahead--low
sand-hills
and
the
sea
breaking
high
then
that
must
be
the
noise
we
hear
we
sweep
in
fast
with
this
heavy
ground-swell
i
wish
the
breeze
would
spring
up
the
sun
was
dipping
under
the
horizon
and
the
calm
still
continued
the
swell
had
driven
the
ter
schilling
so
rapidly
on
the
shore
that
now
they
could
see
the
breakers
which
fell
over
with
the
noise
of
thunder
do
you
know
the
coast
pilot
observed
the
captain
to
schriften
who
stood
by
know
it
well
replied
schriften
the
sea
breaks
in
twelve
fathoms
at
least
in
half
an
hour
the
good
ship
will
be
beaten
into
toothpicks
without
a
breeze
to
help
us
and
the
little
man
giggled
as
if
pleased
at
the
idea
the
anxiety
of
mynheer
kloots
was
not
to
be
concealed
his
pipe
was
every
moment
in
and
out
of
his
mouth
the
crew
remained
in
groups
on
the
forecastle
and
gangway
listening
with
dismay
to
the
fearful
roaring
of
the
breakers
the
sun
had
sunk
down
below
the
horizon
and
the
gloom
of
night
was
gradually
adding
to
the
alarm
of
the
crew
of
the
ter
schilling
we
must
lower
down
the
boats
said
mynheer
kloots
to
the
first
mate
and
try
to
tow
her
off
we
cannot
do
much
good
i'm
afraid
but
at
all
events
the
boats
will
be
ready
for
the
men
to
get
into
before
she
drives
on
shore
get
the
tow
ropes
out
and
lower
down
the
boats
while
i
go
in
to
acquaint
the
supercargo
mynheer
von
stroom
was
sitting
in
all
the
dignity
of
his
office
and
it
being
sunday
had
put
on
his
very
best
wig
he
was
once
more
reading
over
the
letter
to
the
company
relative
to
the
bear
when
mynheer
kloots
made
his
appearance
and
informed
him
in
a
few
words
that
they
were
in
a
situation
of
peculiar
danger
and
that
in
all
probability
the
ship
would
be
in
pieces
in
less
than
half
an
hour
at
this
alarming
intelligence
mynheer
von
stroom
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
in
his
hurry
and
fear
knocked
down
the
candle
which
had
just
been
lighted
in
danger
mynheer
kloots--why
the
water
is
smooth
and
the
wind
down
my
hat--where
is
my
hat
and
my
cane
i
will
go
on
deck
quick
a
light--mynheer
kloots
if
you
please
to
order
a
light
to
be
brought
i
can
find
nothing
in
the
dark
mynheer
kloots
why
do
you
not
answer
mercy
on
me
he
is
gone
and
has
left
me
mynheer
kloots
had
gone
to
fetch
a
light
and
now
returned
with
it
mynheer
von
stroom
put
on
his
hat
and
walked
out
of
the
cabin
the
boats
were
down
and
the
ship's
head
had
been
turned
round
from
the
land
but
it
was
now
quite
dark
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
the
white
line
of
foam
created
by
the
breakers
as
they
dashed
with
an
awful
noise
against
the
shore
mynheer
kloots
if
you
please
i'll
leave
the
ship
directly
let
my
boat
come
alongside--i
must
have
the
largest
boat
for
the
honourable
company's
service--for
the
papers
and
myself
i'm
afraid
not
mynheer
von
stroom
replied
kloots
our
boats
will
hardly
hold
the
men
as
it
is
and
every
man's
life
is
as
valuable
to
himself
as
yours
is
to
you
but
mynheer
i
am
the
company's
supercargo
i
order
you--i
will
have
one--refuse
if
you
dare
i
dare
and
do
refuse
replied
the
captain
taking
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
well
well
replied
mynheer
von
stroom
who
now
lost
all
presence
of
mind--we
will
sir--as
soon
as
we
arrive--lord
help
us--we
are
lost
o
lord
o
lord
and
here
mynheer
von
stroom
not
knowing
why
hurried
down
to
the
cabin
and
in
his
haste
tumbled
over
the
bear
johannes
who
crossed
his
path
and
in
his
fall
his
hat
and
flowing
wig
parted
company
with
his
head
o
mercy
where
am
i
help--help
here
for
the
honourable
company's
supercargo
cast
off
there
in
the
boats
and
come
on
board
cried
mynheer
kloots
we
have
no
time
to
spare
quick
now
philip
put
in
the
compass
the
water
and
the
biscuit
we
must
leave
her
in
five
minutes
so
appalling
was
the
roar
of
the
breakers
that
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
orders
could
be
heard
in
the
mean
time
mynheer
von
stroom
lay
upon
the
deck
kicking
sprawling
and
crying
for
help
there
is
a
light
breeze
off
the
shore
cried
philip
holding
up
his
hand
there
is
but
i'm
afraid
it
is
too
late
hand
the
things
into
the
boats
and
be
cool
my
men
we
have
yet
a
chance
of
saving
her
if
the
wind
freshens
they
were
now
so
near
to
the
breakers
that
they
felt
the
swell
in
which
the
vessel
lay
becalmed
turned
over
here
and
there
on
its
long
line
but
the
breeze
freshened
and
the
vessel
was
stationary
the
men
were
all
in
the
boats
with
the
exception
of
mynheer
kloots
the
mates
and
mynheer
von
stroom
she
goes
through
the
water
now
said
philip
yes
i
think
we
shall
save
her
replied
the
captain
steady
as
you
go
hillebrant
continued
he
to
the
first
mate
who
was
at
the
helm
we
leave
the
breakers
now--only
let
the
breeze
hold
ten
minutes
the
breeze
was
steady
the
ter
schilling
stood
off
from
the
land
again
it
fell
calm
and
again
she
was
swept
towards
the
breakers
at
last
the
breeze
came
off
strong
and
the
vessel
cleaved
through
the
water
the
men
were
called
out
of
the
boats
mynheer
von
stroom
was
picked
up
along
with
his
hat
and
wig
carried
into
the
cabin
and
in
less
than
an
hour
the
ter
schilling
was
out
of
danger
now
we
will
hoist
up
the
boats
said
mynheer
kloots
and
let
us
all
before
we
lie
down
to
sleep
thank
god
for
our
deliverance
during
that
night
the
ter
schilling
made
an
offing
of
twenty
miles
and
then
stood
to
the
southward
towards
the
morning
the
wind
again
fell
and
it
was
nearly
calm
mynheer
kloots
had
been
on
deck
about
an
hour
and
had
been
talking
with
hillebrant
upon
the
danger
of
the
evening
and
the
selfishness
and
pusillanimity
of
mynheer
von
stroom
when
a
loud
noise
was
heard
in
the
poop-cabin
what
can
that
be
said
the
captain
has
the
good
man
lost
his
senses
from
the
fright
why
he
is
knocking
the
cabin
to
pieces
at
this
moment
the
servant
of
the
supercargo
ran
out
of
the
cabin
mynheer
kloots
hasten
in--help
my
master--he
will
be
killed--the
bear--the
bear
the
bear
what
johannes
cried
mynheer
kloots
why
the
animal
is
as
tame
as
a
dog
i
will
go
and
see
but
before
mynheer
kloots
could
walk
into
the
cabin
out
flew
in
his
shirt
the
affrighted
supercargo
my
god
my
god
am
i
to
be
murdered--eaten
alive
cried
he
running
forward
and
attempting
to
climb
the
fore-rigging
mynheer
kloots
followed
the
motions
of
mynheer
von
stroom
with
surprise
and
when
he
found
him
attempting
to
mount
the
rigging
he
turned
aft
and
walked
into
the
cabin
when
he
found
to
his
surprise
that
johannes
was
indeed
doing
mischief
the
panelling
of
the
state
cabin
of
the
supercargo
had
been
beaten
down
the
wig
boxes
lay
in
fragments
on
the
floor
the
two
spare
wigs
were
lying
by
them
and
upon
them
were
strewed
fragments
of
broken
pots
and
masses
of
honey
which
johannes
was
licking
up
with
peculiar
gusto
the
fact
was
that
when
the
ship
anchored
at
table
bay
mynheer
von
stroom
who
was
very
partial
to
honey
had
obtained
some
from
the
hottentots
this
honey
his
careful
servant
had
stowed
away
in
jars
which
he
had
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
two
long
boxes
ready
for
his
master's
use
during
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
that
morning
the
servant
fancying
that
the
wig
of
the
previous
night
had
suffered
when
his
master
tumbled
over
the
bear
opened
one
of
the
boxes
to
take
out
another
johannes
happened
to
come
near
the
door
and
scented
the
honey
now
partial
as
mynheer
von
stroom
was
to
honey
all
bears
are
still
more
so
and
will
venture
everything
to
obtain
it
johannes
had
yielded
to
the
impulse
of
his
species
and
following
the
scent
had
come
into
the
cabin
and
was
about
to
enter
the
sleeping
berth
of
mynheer
stroom
when
the
servant
slammed
the
door
in
his
face
whereupon
johannes
beat
in
the
panels
and
found
an
entrance
he
then
attacked
the
wig-boxes
and
by
showing
a
most
formidable
set
of
teeth
proved
to
the
servant
who
attempted
to
drive
him
off
that
he
would
not
be
trifled
with
in
the
meanwhile
mynheer
von
stroom
was
in
the
utmost
terror
not
aware
of
the
purport
of
the
bear's
visit
he
imagined
that
the
animal's
object
was
to
attack
him
his
servant
took
to
his
heels
after
a
vain
effort
to
save
the
last
box
and
mynheer
von
stroom
then
finding
himself
alone
at
length
sprang
out
of
his
bed-place
and
escaped
as
we
have
mentioned
to
the
forecastle
leaving
johannes
master
of
the
field
and
luxuriating
upon
the
spolia
opima
mynheer
kloots
immediately
perceived
how
the
case
stood
he
went
up
to
the
bear
and
spoke
to
him
then
kicked
him
but
the
bear
would
not
leave
the
honey
and
growled
furiously
at
the
interruption
this
is
a
bad
job
for
you
johannes
observed
mynheer
kloots
now
you
will
leave
the
ship
for
the
supercargo
has
just
grounds
of
complaint
oh
well
you
must
eat
the
honey
because
you
will
so
saying
mynheer
kloots
left
the
cabin
and
went
to
look
after
the
supercargo
who
remained
on
the
forecastle
with
his
bald
head
and
meagre
body
haranguing
the
men
in
his
shirt
which
fluttered
in
the
breeze
i
am
very
sorry
mynheer
von
stroom
said
kloots
but
the
bear
shall
be
sent
out
of
the
vessel
yes
yes
mynheer
kloots
but
this
is
an
affair
for
the
most
puissant
company--the
lives
of
their
servants
are
not
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
folly
of
a
sea-captain
i
have
nearly
been
torn
to
pieces
the
animal
did
not
want
you
all
he
wanted
was
the
honey
replied
kloots
he
has
got
it
and
i
myself
cannot
take
it
from
him
there
is
no
altering
the
nature
of
an
animal
will
you
be
pleased
to
walk
down
into
my
cabin
until
the
beast
can
be
secured
he
shall
not
go
loose
again
mynheer
von
stroom
who
considered
his
dignity
at
variance
with
his
appearance
and
who
perhaps
was
aware
that
majesty
deprived
of
its
externals
was
only
a
jest
thought
it
advisable
to
accept
the
offer
after
some
trouble
with
the
assistance
of
the
seamen
the
bear
was
secured
and
dragged
away
from
the
cabin
much
against
his
will
for
he
had
still
some
honey
to
lick
off
the
curls
of
the
full-bottomed
wigs
he
was
put
into
durance
vile
having
been
caught
in
the
flagrant
act
of
burglary
on
the
high
seas
this
new
adventure
was
the
topic
of
the
day
for
it
was
again
a
dead
calm
and
the
ship
lay
motionless
on
the
glassy
wave
the
sun
looks
red
as
he
sinks
observed
hillebrant
to
the
captain
who
with
philip
was
standing
on
the
poop
we
shall
have
wind
before
to-morrow
if
i
mistake
not
i
am
of
your
opinion
replied
mynheer
kloots
it
is
strange
that
we
do
not
fall
in
with
any
of
the
vessels
of
the
fleet
they
must
all
have
been
driven
down
here
perhaps
they
have
kept
a
wider
offing
it
had
been
as
well
if
we
had
done
the
same
said
kloots
that
was
a
narrow
escape
last
night
there
is
such
a
thing
as
having
too
little
as
well
as
having
too
much
wind
a
confused
noise
was
heard
among
the
seamen
who
were
collected
together
and
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
vessel's
quarter
a
ship
no--
yes
it
is
was
repeated
more
than
once
they
think
they
see
a
ship
said
schriften
coming
on
the
poop
he
he
where
there
in
the
gloom
said
the
pilot
pointing
to
the
darkest
quarter
in
the
horizon
for
the
sun
had
set
the
captain
hillebrant
and
philip
directed
their
eyes
to
the
quarter
pointed
out
and
thought
they
could
perceive
something
like
a
vessel
gradually
the
gloom
seemed
to
clear
away
and
a
lambent
pale
blaze
to
light
up
that
part
of
the
horizon
not
a
breath
of
wind
was
on
the
water--the
sea
was
like
a
mirror--more
and
more
distinct
did
the
vessel
appear
till
her
hull
masts
and
yards
were
clearly
visible
they
looked
and
rubbed
their
eyes
to
help
their
vision
for
scarcely
could
they
believe
that
which
they
did
see
in
the
centre
of
the
pale
light
which
extended
about
fifteen
degrees
above
the
horizon
there
was
indeed
a
large
ship
about
three
miles
distant
but
although
it
was
a
perfect
calm
she
was
to
all
appearance
buffeting
in
a
violent
gale
plunging
and
lifting
over
a
surface
that
was
smooth
as
glass
now
careening
to
her
bearing
then
recovering
herself
her
topsails
and
mainsail
were
furled
and
the
yards
pointed
to
the
wind
she
had
no
sail
set
but
a
close-reefed
foresail
a
storm
staysail
and
trysail
abaft
she
made
little
way
through
the
water
but
apparently
neared
them
fast
driven
down
by
the
force
of
the
gale
each
minute
she
was
plainer
to
the
view
at
last
she
was
seen
to
wear
and
in
so
doing
before
she
was
brought
to
the
wind
on
the
other
tack
she
was
so
close
to
them
that
they
could
distinguish
the
men
on
board
they
could
see
the
foaming
water
as
it
was
hurled
from
her
bows
hear
the
shrill
whistle
of
the
boatswain's
pipes
the
creaking
of
the
ship's
timbers
and
the
complaining
of
her
masts
and
then
the
gloom
gradually
rose
and
in
a
few
seconds
she
had
totally
disappeared
god
in
heaven
exclaimed
mynheer
kloots
philip
felt
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
the
cold
darted
through
his
whole
frame
he
turned
round
and
met
the
one
eye
of
schriften
who
screamed
in
his
ear--
philip
vanderdecken--that's
the
flying
dutchman
the
sudden
gloom
which
had
succeeded
to
the
pale
light
had
the
effect
of
rendering
every
object
still
more
indistinct
to
the
astonished
crew
of
the
ter
schilling
for
a
moment
or
more
not
a
word
was
uttered
by
a
soul
on
board
some
remained
with
their
eyes
still
strained
towards
the
point
where
the
apparition
had
been
seen
others
turned
away
full
of
gloomy
and
foreboding
thoughts
hillebrant
was
the
first
who
spoke
turning
round
to
the
eastern
quarter
and
observing
a
light
on
the
horizon
he
started
and
seizing
philip
by
the
arm
cried
out
what's
that
that
is
only
the
moon
rising
from
the
bank
of
clouds
replied
philip
mournfully
well
observed
mynheer
kloots
wiping
his
forehead
which
was
damped
with
perspiration
i
have
been
told
of
this
before
but
i
have
mocked
at
the
narration
philip
made
no
reply
aware
of
the
reality
of
the
vision
and
how
deeply
it
interested
him
he
felt
as
if
he
were
a
guilty
person
the
moon
had
now
risen
above
the
clouds
and
was
pouring
her
mild
pale
light
over
the
slumbering
ocean
with
a
simultaneous
impulse
every
one
directed
his
eyes
to
the
spot
where
the
strange
vision
had
last
been
seen
and
all
was
a
dead
dead
calm
since
the
apparition
the
pilot
schriften
had
remained
on
the
poop
he
now
gradually
approached
mynheer
kloots
and
looking
round
said--
mynheer
kloots
as
pilot
of
this
vessel
i
tell
you
that
you
must
prepare
for
very
bad
weather
bad
weather
said
kloots
rousing
himself
from
a
deep
reverie
yes
bad
weather
mynheer
kloots
there
never
was
a
vessel
which
fell
in
with--what
we
have
just
seen
but
met
with
disaster
soon
afterwards
the
very
name
of
vanderdecken
is
unlucky--he
he
philip
would
have
replied
to
this
sarcasm
but
he
could
not
his
tongue
was
tied
what
has
the
name
of
vanderdecken
to
do
with
it
observed
kloots
have
you
not
heard
then
the
captain
of
that
vessel
we
have
just
seen
is
a
mynheer
vanderdecken--he
is
the
flying
dutchman
how
know
you
that
pilot
inquired
hillebrant
i
know
that
and
much
more
if
i
chose
to
tell
replied
schriften
but
never
mind
i
have
warned
you
of
bad
weather
as
is
my
duty
and
with
these
words
schriften
went
down
the
poop-ladder
god
in
heaven
i
never
was
so
puzzled
and
so
frightened
in
my
life
observed
kloots
i
don't
know
what
to
think
or
say--what
think
you
philip
was
it
not
supernatural
yes
replied
philip
mournfully
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
i
thought
the
days
of
miracles
had
passed
said
the
captain
and
that
we
were
now
left
to
our
own
exertions
and
had
no
other
warnings
but
those
the
appearance
of
the
heavens
gave
us
and
they
warn
us
now
observed
hillebrant
see
how
that
bank
of
clouds
has
risen
within
these
five
minutes--the
moon
has
escaped
from
it
but
it
will
soon
catch
her
again--and
see
there
is
a
flash
of
lightning
in
the
north-west
well
my
sons
i
can
brave
the
elements
as
well
as
any
man
and
do
my
best
i
have
cared
little
for
gales
or
stress
of
weather
but
i
like
not
such
a
warning
as
we
have
had
tonight
my
heart's
as
heavy
as
lead
and
that's
the
truth
philip
send
down
for
the
bottle
of
schnapps
if
it
is
only
to
clear
my
brain
a
little
philip
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
quit
the
poop
he
wished
to
have
a
few
minutes
to
recover
himself
and
collect
his
own
thoughts
the
appearance
of
the
phantom
ship
had
been
to
him
a
dreadful
shock
not
that
he
had
not
fully
believed
in
its
existence
but
still
to
have
beheld
to
have
been
so
near
that
vessel--that
vessel
in
which
his
father
was
fulfilling
his
awful
doom--that
vessel
on
board
of
which
he
felt
sure
that
his
own
destiny
was
to
be
worked
out--had
given
a
whirl
to
his
brain
when
he
had
heard
the
sound
of
the
boatswain's
whistle
on
board
of
her
eagerly
had
he
stretched
his
earing
to
catch
the
order
given--and
given
he
was
convinced
in
his
father's
voice
nor
had
his
eyes
been
less
called
to
aid
in
his
attempt
to
discover
the
features
and
dress
of
those
moving
on
her
decks
as
soon
then
as
he
had
sent
the
boy
up
to
mynheer
kloots
philip
hastened
to
his
cabin
and
buried
his
face
in
the
coverlid
of
his
bed
and
then
he
prayed--prayed
until
he
had
recovered
his
usual
energy
and
courage
and
brought
his
mind
to
that
state
of
composure
which
could
enable
him
to
look
forward
calmly
to
danger
and
difficulty
and
feel
prepared
to
meet
it
with
the
heroism
of
a
martyr
philip
remained
below
not
more
than
half
an
hour
on
his
return
to
the
deck
what
a
change
had
taken
place
he
had
left
the
vessel
floating
motionless
on
the
still
waters
with
her
lofty
sails
hanging
down
listlessly
from
the
yards
the
moon
then
soared
aloft
in
her
beauty
reflecting
the
masts
and
sails
of
the
ship
in
extended
lines
upon
the
smooth
sea
now
all
was
dark
the
water
rippled
short
and
broke
in
foam
the
smaller
and
lofty
sails
had
been
taken
in
and
the
vessel
was
cleaving
through
the
water
and
the
wind
in
fitful
gusts
and
angry
moanings
proclaimed
too
surely
that
it
had
been
awakened
up
to
wrath
and
was
gathering
its
strength
for
destruction
the
men
were
still
busy
reducing
the
sails
but
they
worked
gloomily
and
discontentedly
what
schriften
the
pilot
had
said
to
them
philip
knew
not
but
that
they
avoided
him
and
appeared
to
look
upon
him
with
feelings
of
ill-will
was
evident
and
each
minute
the
gale
increased
the
wind
is
not
steady
observed
hillebrant
there
is
no
saying
from
which
quarter
the
storm
may
blow
it
has
already
veered
round
five
points
philip
i
don't
much
like
the
appearance
of
things
and
i
may
say
with
the
captain
that
my
heart
is
heavy
and
indeed
so
is
mine
replied
philip
but
we
are
in
the
hands
of
a
merciful
providence
hard
a-port
flatten
in
forward
brail
up
the
trysail
my
men
be
smart
cried
kloots
as
from
the
wind's
chopping
round
to
the
northward
and
westward
the
ship
was
taken
aback
and
careened
low
before
it
the
rain
now
came
down
in
torrents
and
it
was
so
dark
that
it
was
with
difficulty
they
could
perceive
each
other
on
the
deck
we
must
clew
up
the
topsails
while
the
men
can
get
upon
the
yards
see
to
it
forward
mr
hillebrant
the
lightning
now
darted
athwart
the
firmament
and
the
thunder
pealed
quick
quick
my
men
let's
furl
all
the
sailors
shook
the
water
from
their
streaming
clothes
some
worked
others
took
advantage
of
the
night
to
hide
themselves
away
and
commune
with
their
own
fears
all
canvass
was
now
taken
off
the
ship
except
the
fore-staysail
and
she
flew
to
the
southward
with
the
wind
on
her
quarter
the
sea
had
now
risen
and
roared
as
it
curled
in
foam
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
the
night
was
dark
as
erebus
and
the
wet
and
frightened
sailors
sheltered
themselves
under
the
bulwarks
although
many
had
deserted
from
their
duty
there
was
not
one
who
ventured
below
that
night
they
did
not
collect
together
as
usual--every
man
preferred
solitude
and
his
own
thoughts
the
phantom
ship
dwelt
on
their
imaginations
and
oppressed
their
brains
it
was
an
interminably
long
and
terrible
night--they
thought
the
day
would
never
come
at
last
the
darkness
gradually
changed
to
a
settled
sullen
grey
gloom--which
was
day
they
looked
at
each
other
but
found
no
comfort
in
meeting
each
other's
eyes
there
was
no
one
countenance
in
which
a
beam
of
hope
could
be
found
lurking
they
were
all
doomed--
they
remained
crouched
where
they
had--sheltered
themselves
during
the
night
and
said
nothing
the
sea
had
now
risen
mountains
high
and
more
than
once
had
struck
the
ship
abaft
kloots
was
at
the
binnacle
hillebrant
and
philip
at
the
helm
when
a
wave
curled
high
over
the
quarter
and
poured
itself
in
resistless
force
upon
the
deck
the
captain
and
his
two
mates
were
swept
away
and
dashed
almost
senseless
against
the
bulwarks--the
binnacle
and
compass
were
broken
into
fragments--no
one
ran
to
the
helm--the
vessel
broached
to--the
seas
broke
clear
over
her
and
the
mainmast
went
by
the
board
all
was
confusion
captain
kloots
was
stunned
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
philip
could
persuade
two
of
the
men
to
assist
him
down
below
hillebrant
had
been
more
unfortunate--his
right
arm
was
broken
and
he
was
otherwise
severely
bruised
philip
assisted
him
to
his
berth
and
then
went
on
deck
again
to
try
and
restore
order
philip
vanderdecken
was
not
yet
much
of
a
seaman
but
at
all
events
he
exercised
that
moral
influence
over
the
men
which
is
ever
possessed
by
resolution
and
courage
obey
willingly
they
did
not
but
they
did
obey
and
in
half
an
hour
the
vessel
was
clear
of
the
wreck
eased
by
the
loss
of
her
heavy
mast
and
steered
by
two
of
her
best
seamen
she
again
flew
before
the
gale
where
was
mynheer
von
stroom
during
all
this
work
of
destruction
in
his
bed-place
covered
up
with
the
clothes
trembling
in
every
limb
and
vowing
that
it
ever
again
he
put
his
foot
on
shore
not
all
the
companies
in
the
world
should
induce
him
to
trust
to
salt-water
again
it
certainly
was
the
best
plan
for
the
poor
man
but
although
for
a
time
the
men
obeyed
the
orders
of
philip
they
were
soon
seen
talking
earnestly
with
the
one-eyed
pilot
and
after
a
consultation
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
all
left
the
deck
with
the
exception
of
the
two
at
the
helm
their
reasons
for
so
doing
were
soon
apparent--several
returned
with
cans
full
of
liquor
which
they
had
obtained
by
forcing
the
hatches
of
the
spirit-room
for
about
an
hour
philip
remained
on
deck
persuading
the
men
not
to
intoxicate
themselves
but
in
vain
the
cans
of
grog
offered
to
the
men
at
the
wheel
were
not
refused
and
in
a
short
time
the
yawing
of
the
vessel
proved
that
the
liquor
had
taken
its
effect
philip
then
hastened
down
below
to
ascertain
if
mynheer
kloots
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
come
on
deck
he
found
him
sunk
into
a
deep
sleep
and
with
difficulty
it
was
that
he
roused
him
and
made
him
acquainted
with
the
distressing
intelligence
mynheer
kloots
followed
philip
on
deck
but
he
still
suffered
from
his
fail
his
head
was
confused
and
he
reeled
as
he
walked
as
if
he
also
had
been
making
free
with
the
liquor
when
he
had
been
on
deck
a
few
minutes
he
sank
down
on
one
of
the
guns
in
a
state
of
perfect
helplessness
he
had
in
fact
received
a
severe
concussion
of
the
brain
hillebrant
was
too
severely
injured
to
be
able
to
move
from
his
bed
and
philip
was
now
aware
of
the
helplessness
of
their
situation
daylight
gradually
disappeared
and
as
darkness
came
upon
them
so
did
the
scene
become
more
appalling
the
vessel
still
ran
before
the
gale
but
the
men
at
the
helm
had
evidently
changed
her
course
as
the
wind
that
was
on
the
starboard
was
now
on
the
larboard
quarter
but
compass
there
was
none
on
deck
and
even
if
there
had
been
the
men
in
their
drunken
state
would
have
refused
to
listen
to
philip's
orders
or
expostulations
he
they
said
was
no
sailor
and
was
not
to
teach
them
how
to
steer
the
ship
the
gale
was
now
at
its
height
the
rain
had
ceased
but
the
wind
had
increased
and
it
roared
as
it
urged
on
the
vessel
which
steered
so
wide
by
the
drunken
sailors
shipped
seas
over
each
gunnel
but
the
men
laughed
and
joined
the
chorus
of
their
songs
to
the
howling
of
the
gale
schriften
the
pilot
appeared
to
be
the
leader
of
the
ship's
company
with
the
can
of
liquor
in
his
hand
he
danced
and
sang
snapped
his
fingers
and
like
a
demon
peered
with
his
one
eye
upon
philip
and
then
would
he
fall
and
roll
with
screams
of
laughter
in
the
scuppers
more
liquor
was
handed
up
as
fast
as
it
was
called
for
oaths
shrieks
laughter
were
mingled
together
the
men
at
the
helm
lashed
it
amid-ships
and
hastened
to
join
their
companions
and
the
ter
schilling
flew
before
the
gale
the
fore-staysail
being
the
only
sail
set
checking
her
as
she
yawed
to
starboard
or
to
port
philip
remained
on
deck
by
the
poop-ladder
strange
thought
he
that
i
should
stand
here
the
only
one
left
now
capable
of
acting--that
i
should
be
fated
to
look
by
myself
upon
this
scene
of
horror
and
disgust--should
here
wait
the
severing
of
this
vessel's
timbers--the
loss
of
life
which
must
accompany
it--the
only
one
calm
and
collected
or
aware
of
what
must
soon
take
place
god
forgive
me
but
i
appear
useless
and
impotent
as
i
am
to
stand
here
like
the
master
of
the
storm--separated
as
it
were
from
my
brother
mortals
by
my
own
peculiar
destiny
it
must
be
so
this
wreck
then
must
not
be
for
me
i
feel
that
it
is
not--that
i
have
a
charmed
life
or
rather
a
protracted
one
to
fulfil
the
oath
i
registered
in
heaven
but
the
wind
is
not
so
loud
surely
the
water
is
not
so
rough
my
forebodings
may
be
wrong
and
all
may
yet
be
saved
heaven
grant
it
for
how
melancholy
how
lamentable
is
it
to
behold
men
created
in
god's
own
image
leaving
the
world
disgraced
below
the
brute
creation
philip
was
right
in
supposing
that
the
wind
was
not
so
strong
nor
the
sea
so
high
the
vessel
after
running
to
the
southward
till
past
table
bay
had
by
the
alteration
made
in
her
course
entered
into
false
bay
where
to
a
certain
degree
she
was
sheltered
from
the
violence
of
the
winds
and
waves
but
although
the
water
was
smoother
the
waves
were
still
more
than
sufficient
to
beat
to
pieces
any
vessel
that
might
be
driven
on
shore
at
the
bottom
of
the
bay
to
which
point
the
ter
schilling
was
now
running
the
bay
so
far
offered
a
fair
chance
of
escape
as
instead
of
the
rocky
coast
outside
against
which
had
the
vessel
run
a
few
seconds
would
have
insured
her
destruction
there
was
a
shelving
beach
of
loose
sand
but
of
this
philip
could
of
course
have
no
knowledge
for
the
land
at
the
entrance
of
the
bay
had
been
passed
unperceived
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
about
twenty
minutes
more
had
elapsed
when
philip
observed
that
the
whole
sea
around
them
was
one
continued
foam
he
had
hardly
time
for
conjecture
before
the
ship
struck
heavily
on
the
sands
and
the
remaining
masts
fell
by
the
board
the
crush
of
the
falling
masts
the
heavy
beating
of
the
ship
on
the
sands
which
caused
many
of
her
timbers
to
part
with
a
whole
sea
which
swept
clean
over
the
fated
vessel
checked
the
songs
and
drunken
revelry
of
the
crew
another
minute
and
the
vessel
was
swung
round
on
her
broadside
to
the
sea
and
lay
on
her
beam
ends
philip
who
was
to
windward
clung
to
the
bulwark
while
the
intoxicated
seamen
floundered
in
the
water
to
leeward
and
attempted
to
gain
the
other
side
of
the
ship
much
to
philip's
horror
he
perceived
the
body
of
mynheer
kloots
sink
down
in
the
water
which
now
was
several
feet
deep
on
the
lee
side
of
the
deck
without
any
apparent
effort
on
the
part
of
the
captain
to
save
himself
he
was
then
gone
and
there
were
no
hopes
for
him
philip
thought
of
hillebrant
and
hastened
down
below
he
found
him
still
in
his
bed-place
lying
against
the
side
he
lifted
him
out
and
with
difficulty
climbed
with
him
on
deck
and
laid
him
in
the
long-boat
on
the
booms
as
the
best
chance
of
saving
his
life
to
this
boat
the
only
one
which
could
be
made
available
the
crew
had
also
repaired
but
they
repulsed
philip
who
would
have
got
into
her
and
as
the
sea
made
clean
breakers
over
them
they
cast
loose
the
lashings
which
confined
her
with
the
assistance
of
another
heavy
sea
which
lifted
her
from
the
chocks
she
was
borne
clear
of
the
booms
and
dashed
over
the
gunnel
into
the
water
to
leeward
which
was
comparatively
smooth--not
however
without
being
filled
nearly
up
to
the
thwarts
but
this
was
little
cared
for
by
the
intoxicated
seamen
who
as
soon
as
they
were
afloat
again
raised
their
shouts
and
songs
of
revelry
as
they
were
borne
away
by
the
wind
and
sea
towards
the
beach
philip
who
held
on
by
the
stump
of
the
mainmast
watched
them
with
an
anxious
eye
now
perceiving
them
borne
aloft
on
the
foaming
surf
now
disappearing
in
the
trough
more
and
more
distant
were
the
sounds
of
their
mad
voices
till
at
last
he
could
hear
them
no
more--he
beheld
the
boat
balanced
on
an
enormous
rolling
sea
and
then
he
saw
it
not
again
philip
knew
that
now
his
only
chance
was
to
remain
with
the
vessel
and
attempt
to
save
himself
upon
some
fragment
of
the
wreck
that
the
ship
would
long
hold
together
he
felt
was
impossible
already
she
had
parted
her
upper
decks
and
each
shock
of
the
waves
divided
her
more
and
more
at
last
as
he
clung
to
the
mast
he
heard
a
noise
abaft
and
he
then
recollected
that
mynheer
von
stroom
was
still
in
his
cabin
philip
crawled
aft
and
found
that
the
poop-ladder
had
been
thrown
against
the
cabin
door
so
as
to
prevent
its
being
opened
he
removed
it
and
entered
the
cabin
where
he
found
mynheer
von
stroom
clinging
to
windward
with
the
grasp
of
death--but
it
was
not
death
but
the
paralysis
of
fear
he
spoke
to
him
but
could
obtain
no
reply
he
attempted
to
move
him
but
it
was
impossible
to
make
him
let
go
the
part
of
the
bulk-head
that
he
grasped
a
loud
noise
and
the
rush
of
a
mass
of
water
told
philip
that
the
vessel
had
parted
amid-ships
and
he
unwillingly
abandoned
the
poor
supercargo
to
his
fate
and
went
out
of
the
cabin
door
at
the
after-hatchway
he
observed
something
struggling--it
was
johannes
the
bear
who
was
swimming
but
still
fastened
by
a
cord
which
prevented
his
escape
philip
took
out
his
knife
and
released
the
poor
animal
and
hardly
had
he
done
this
act
of
kindness
when
a
heavy
sea
turned
over
the
after
part
of
the
vessel
which
separated
in
many
pieces
and
philip
found
himself
struggling
in
the
waves
he
seized
upon
a
part
of
the
deck
which
supported
him
and
was
borne
away
by
the
surf
towards
the
beach
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
near
to
the
land
and
shortly
afterwards
the
piece
of
planking
to
which
he
was
clinging
struck
on
the
sand
and
then
being
turned
over
by
the
force
of
the
running
wave
philip
lost
his
hold
and
was
left
to
his
own
exertions
he
struggled
long
but
although
so
near
to
the
shore
could
not
gain
a
footing
the
returning
wave
dragged
him
back
and
thus
was
he
hurled
to
and
fro
until
his
strength
was
gone
he
was
sinking
under
the
wave
to
rise
no
more
when
he
felt
something
touch
his
hand
he
seized
it
with
the
grasp
of
death
it
was
the
shaggy
hide
of
the
bear
johannes
who
was
making
for
the
shore
and
who
soon
dragged
him
clear
of
the
surf
so
that
he
could
gain
a
footing
philip
crawled
up
the
beach
above
the
reach
of
the
waves
and
exhausted
with
fatigue
sank
down
in
a
swoon
when
philip
was
recalled
from
his
state
of
lethargy
his
first
feeling
was
intense
pain
in
his
still-closed
eyes
arising
from
having
been
many
hours
exposed
to
the
rays
of
an
ardent
sun
he
opened
them
but
was
obliged
to
close
them
immediately
for
the
light
entered
into
them
like
the
point
of
a
knife
he
turned
over
on
his
side
and
covering
them
with
his
hand
remained
some
time
in
that
position
until
by
degrees
he
found
that
his
eyesight
was
restored
he
then
rose
and
after
a
few
seconds
could
distinguish
the
scene
around
him
the
sea
was
still
rough
and
tossed
about
in
the
surf
fragments
of
the
vessel
the
whole
sand
was
strewed
with
her
cargo
and
contents
near
him
was
the
body
of
hillebrant
and
the
other
bodies
who
were
scattered
on
the
beach
told
him
that
those
who
had
taken
to
the
boat
had
all
perished
it
was
by
the
height
of
the
sun
about
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
as
near
as
he
could
estimate
but
philip
suffered
such
an
oppression
of
mind
he
felt
so
wearied
and
in
such
pain
that
he
took
but
a
slight
survey
his
brain
was
whirling
and
all
he
demanded
was
repose
he
walked
away
from
the
scene
of
destruction
and
having
found
a
sand-hill
behind
which
he
was
defended
from
the
burning
rays
of
the
sun
he
again
lay
down
and
sank
into
a
deep
sleep
from
which
he
did
not
wake
until
the
ensuing
morning
philip
was
roused
a
second
time
by
the
sensation
of
something
pricking
him
on
the
chest
he
started
up
and
beheld
a
figure
standing
over
him
his
eyes
were
still
feeble
and
his
vision
indistinct
he
rubbed
them
for
a
time
for
he
first
thought
it
was
the
bear
johannes
and
again
that
it
was
the
supercargo
von
stroom
who
had
appeared
before
him
he
looked
again
and
found
that
he
was
mistaken
although
he
had
warrant
for
supposing
it
to
be
either
or
both
a
tall
hottentot
with
an
assaguay
in
his
hand
stood
by
his
side
over
his
shoulder
he
had
thrown
the
fresh-severed
skin
of
the
poor
bear
and
on
his
head
with
the
curls
descending
to
his
waist
was
one
of
the
wigs
of
the
supercargo
von
stroom
such
was
the
gravity
of
the
black's
appearance
in
this
strange
costume
for
in
every
other
respect
he
was
naked
that
at
any
other
time
philip
would
have
been
induced
to
laugh
heartily
but
his
feelings
were
now
too
acute
he
rose
upon
his
feet
and
stood
by
the
side
of
the
hottentot
who
still
continued
immovable
but
certainly
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
hostile
intentions
a
sensation
of
overpowering
thirst
now
seized
upon
philip
and
he
made
signs
that
he
wished
to
drink
the
hottentot
motioned
to
him
to
follow
and
led
over
the
sand-hills
to
the
beach
where
philip
discovered
upwards
of
fifty
men
who
were
busy
selecting
various
articles
from
the
scattered
stores
of
the
vessel
it
was
evident
by
the
respect
paid
to
philip's
conductor
that
he
was
the
chief
of
the
kraal
a
few
words
uttered
with
the
greatest
solemnity
were
sufficient
to
produce
though
not
exactly
what
philip
required
a
small
quantity
of
dirty
water
from
a
calabash
which
however
was
to
him
delicious
his
conductor
then
waved
to
him
to
take
a
seat
on
the
sand
it
was
a
novel
and
appalling
and
nevertheless
a
ludicrous
scene
there
was
the
white
sand
rendered
still
more
white
by
the
strong
glare
of
the
sun
strewed
with
the
fragments
of
the
vessel
with
casks
and
bales
of
merchandise
there
was
the
running
surge
with
its
foam
throwing
about
particles
of
the
wreck
there
were
the
bones
of
whales
which
had
been
driven
on
shore
in
some
former
gale
and
which
now
half-buried
in
the
sand
showed
portions
of
huge
skeletons
there
were
the
mangled
bodies
of
philip's
late
companions
whose
clothes
it
appeared
had
been
untouched
by
the
savages
with
the
exception
of
the
buttons
which
had
been
eagerly
sought
after
there
were
naked
hottentots
for
it
was
summer
time
and
they
wore
not
their
sheepskin
krosses
gravely
stepping
up
and
down
the
sand
picking
up
everything
that
was
of
no
value
and
leaving
all
that
civilised
people
most
coveted--to
crown
all
there
was
the
chief
sitting
in
the
still
bloody
skin
of
johannes
and
the
broad-bottomed
wig
of
mynheer
stroom
with
all
the
gravity
of
a
vice-chancellor
in
his
countenance
and
without
the
slightest
idea
that
he
was
in
any
way
ridiculous
the
whole
presented
perhaps
one
of
the
most
strange
and
chaotic
tableaux
that
ever
was
witnessed
although
at
that
time
the
dutch
had
not
very
long
formed
their
settlement
at
the
cape
a
considerable
traffic
had
been
for
many
years
carried
on
with
the
natives
for
skins
and
other
african
productions
the
hottentots
were
therefore
no
strangers
to
vessels
and
as
hitherto
they
had
been
treated
with
kindness
were
well-disposed
towards
europeans
after
a
time
the
hottentots
began
to
collect
all
the
wood
which
appeared
to
have
iron
in
it
made
it
up
into
several
piles
and
set
them
on
fire
the
chief
then
made
a
sign
to
philip
to
ask
him
if
he
was
hungry
philip
replied
in
the
affirmative
when
his
new
acquaintance
put
his
hand
into
a
bag
made
of
goat-skin
and
pulled
out
a
handful
of
very
large
beetles
and
presented
them
to
hum
philip
refused
them
with
marks
of
disgust
upon
which
the
chief
very
sedately
cracked
and
ate
them
and
having
finished
the
whole
handful
rose
and
made
a
sign
to
philip
to
follow
him
as
philip
rose
he
perceived
floating
on
the
surf
his
own
chest
he
hastened
to
it
and
made
signs
that
it
was
his
took
the
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
opened
it
and
then
made
up
a
bundle
of
articles
most
useful
not
forgetting
a
bag
of
guilders
his
conductor
made
no
objection
but
calling
to
one
of
the
men
near
pointed
out
the
lock
and
hinges
to
him
and
then
set
off
followed
by
philip
across
the
sand-hills
in
about
an
hour
they
arrived
at
the
kraal
consisting
of
low
huts
covered
with
skins
and
were
met
by
the
women
and
children
who
appeared
to
be
in
high
admiration
at
their
chief's
new
attire
the
showed
every
kindness
to
philip
bringing
him
milk
which
he
drank
eagerly
philip
surveyed
these
daughters
of
eve
and
as
he
turned
from
their
offensive
greasy
attire
their
strange
forms
and
hideous
features
he
sighed
and
thought
of
his
charming
amine
the
sun
was
now
setting
and
philip
still
felt
fatigued
he
made
signs
that
he
wished
to
repose
they
led
him
into
a
hut
and
though
surrounded
as
he
was
with
filth
and
his
nose
assailed
by
every
variety
of
bad
smell
attacked
moreover
by
insects
he
laid
his
head
on
his
bundle
and
uttering
a
short
prayer
of
thanksgiving
was
soon
in
a
sound
sleep
the
next
morning
he
was
awakened
by
the
chief
of
the
kraal
accompanied
by
another
man
who
spoke
a
little
dutch
he
stated
his
wish
to
be
taken
to
the
settlement
where
the
ships
came
and
anchored
and
was
fully
understood
but
the
man
said
that
there
were
no
ships
in
the
bay
at
the
time
philip
nevertheless
requested
he
might
be
taken
there
as
he
felt
that
his
best
chance
of
getting
on
board
of
any
vessel
would
be
by
remaining
at
the
settlement
and
at
all
events
he
would
be
in
the
company
of
europeans
until
a
vessel
arrived
the
distance
he
discovered
was
but
one
day's
march
or
less
after
some
little
conversation
with
the
chief
the
man
who
spoke
dutch
desired
philip
to
follow
him
and
that
he
would
take
him
there
philip
drank
plentifully
from
a
bowl
of
milk
brought
him
by
one
of
the
women
and
again
refusing
a
handful
of
beetles
offered
by
the
chief
he
took
up
his
bundle
and
followed
his
new
acquaintance
towards
evening
they
arrived
at
the
hills
from
which
philip
had
a
view
of
table
bay
and
the
few
houses
erected
by
the
dutch
to
his
delight
he
perceived
that
there
was
a
vessel
under
sail
in
the
offing
on
his
arrival
at
the
beach
to
which
he
hastened
he
found
that
she
had
sent
a
boat
on
shore
for
fresh
provisions
he
accosted
the
people
told
them
who
he
was
told
them
also
of
the
fatal
wreck
of
the
ter
schilling
and
of
his
wish
to
embark
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
boat
willingly
consented
to
take
him
on
board
and
informed
philip
that
they
were
homeward
bound
philip's
heart
leaped
at
the
intelligence
had
she
been
outward
bound
he
would
have
joined
her
but
now
he
had
a
prospect
of
again
seeing
his
dear
amine
before
he
re-embarked
to
follow
out
his
peculiar
destiny
he
felt
that
there
was
still
some
happiness
in
store
for
him
that
his
life
was
to
be
chequered
with
alternate
privation
and
repose
and
that
his
future
prospect
was
not
to
be
one
continued
chain
of
suffering
until
death
he
was
kindly
received
by
the
captain
of
the
vessel
who
freely
gave
him
a
passage
home
and
in
three
months
without
any
events
worth
narrating
philip
vanderdecken
found
himself
once
more
at
anchor
before
the
town
of
amsterdam
it
need
hardly
be
observed
that
philip
made
all
possible
haste
to
his
own
little
cottage
which
contained
all
that
he
valued
in
this
world
he
promised
to
himself
some
months
of
happiness
for
he
had
done
his
duty
and
he
felt
that
however
desirous
of
fulfilling
his
vow
he
could
not
again
leave
home
till
the
autumn
when
the
next
fleet
sailed
and
it
was
now
but
the
commencement
of
april
much
too
as
he
regretted
the
loss
of
mynheer
kloots
and
hillebrant
as
well
as
the
deaths
of
the
unfortunate
crew
still
there
was
some
solace
in
the
remembrance
that
he
was
for
ever
rid
of
the
wretch
schriften
who
had
shared
their
fate
and
besides
he
almost
blessed
the
wreck
so
fatal
to
others
which
enabled
him
so
soon
to
return
to
the
arms
of
his
amine
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
philip
took
a
boat
from
flushing
and
went
over
to
his
cottage
at
terneuse
it
was
a
rough
evening
for
the
season
of
the
year
the
wind
blew
fresh
and
the
sky
was
covered
with
flaky
clouds
fringed
here
and
there
with
broad
white
edges
for
the
light
of
the
moon
was
high
in
the
heavens
and
she
was
at
her
full
at
times
her
light
would
be
almost
obscured
by
a
dark
cloud
passing
over
her
disk
at
others
she
would
burst
out
in
all
her
brightness
philip
landed
and
wrapping
his
cloak
round
him
hastened
up
to
his
cottage
as
with
a
beating
heart
he
approached
he
perceived
that
the
window
of
the
parlour
was
open
and
that
there
was
a
female
figure
leaning
out
he
knew
that
it
could
be
no
other
than
his
amine
and
after
he
crossed
the
little
bridge
he
proceeded
to
the
window
instead
of
going
to
the
door
amine
for
it
was
she
who
stood
at
the
window
was
so
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
heavens
above
her
and
so
deep
in
communion
with
her
own
thoughts
that
she
neither
saw
nor
heard
the
approach
of
her
husband
philip
perceived
her
abstraction
and
paused
when
within
four
or
five
yards
of
her
he
wished
to
gain
the
door
without
being
observed
as
he
was
afraid
of
alarming
her
by
his
too
sudden
appearance
for
he
remembered
his
promise
that
if
dead
he
would
if
permitted
visit
her
as
his
father
had
visited
his
mother
but
while
he
thus
stood
in
suspense
amine's
eyes
were
turned
upon
him
she
beheld
him
but
a
thick
cloud
now
obscured
the
moon's
disk
and
the
dim
light
gave
to
his
form
indistinctly
seen
an
unearthly
and
shadowy
appearance
she
recognised
her
husband
but
having
no
reason
to
expect
his
return
she
recognised
him
as
an
inhabitant
of
the
world
of
spirits
she
started
parted
the
hair
away
from
her
forehead
with
both
hands
and
again
earnestly
gazed
on
him
it
is
i
amine
do
not
be
afraid
cried
philip
hastily
i
am
not
afraid
replied
amine
pressing
her
hand
to
her
heart
it
is
over
now
spirit
of
my
dear
husband--for
such
i
think
thou
art--i
thank
thee
welcome
even
in
death
philip--welcome
and
amine
waved
her
hand
mournfully
inviting
philip
to
enter
as
she
retired
from
the
window
my
god
she
thinks
me
dead
thought
philip
and
hardly
knowing
how
to
act
he
entered
in
at
the
window
and
found
her
sitting
on
the
sofa
philip
would
have
spoken
but
amine
whose
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
as
he
entered
and
who
was
fully
convinced
that
he
was
but
a
supernatural
appearance
exclaimed--
so
soon--so
soon
o
god
thy
will
be
done
but
it
is
hard
to
bear
philip
beloved
philip
i
feel
that
i
soon
shall
follow
you
philip
was
now
more
alarmed
he
was
fearful
of
any
sudden
reaction
when
amine
should
discover
that
he
was
still
alive
amine
dear
hear
me
i
have
appeared
unexpectedly
and
at
an
unusual
hour
but
throw
yourself
into
my
arms
and
you
will
find
that
your
philip
is
not
dead
not
dead
cried
amine
starting
up
no
no
still
warm
in
flesh
and
blood
amine--still
your
fond
and
doting
husband
replied
philip
catching
her
in
his
arms
and
pressing
her
to
his
heart
amine
sank
from
his
embrace
down
upon
the
sofa
and
fortunately
was
relieved
by
a
burst
of
tears
while
philip
kneeling
by
her
supported
her
o
god
o
god
i
thank
thee
relied
amine
at
last
i
thought
it
was
your
spirit
philip
o
i
was
glad
to
see
even
that
continued
she
weeping
on
his
shoulder
can
you
listen
to
me
dearest
said
philip
after
a
silence
of
a
few
moments
o
speak--speak
love
i
can
listen
for
ever
in
a
few
words
philip
then
recounted
what
had
taken
place
and
the
occasion
of
his
unexpected
return
and
felt
himself
more
than
repaid
for
all
that
he
had
suffered
by
the
fond
endearments
of
his
still
agitated
amine
and
your
father
amine
he
is
well
we
will
talk
of
him
to-morrow
yes
thought
philip
as
he
awoke
next
morning
and
dwelt
upon
the
lovely
features
of
his
still
slumbering
wife
yes
god
is
merciful
i
feel
that
there
is
still
happiness
in
store
for
me
nay
more
that
that
happiness
also
depends
upon
my
due
performance
of
my
task
and
that
i
should
be
punished
if
i
were
to
forget
my
solemn
vow
be
it
so--
through
danger
and
to
death
will
i
perform
my
duty
trusting
to
his
mercy
for
a
reward
both
here
below
and
in
heaven
above
am
i
not
repaid
for
all
that
i
have
suffered
o
yes
more
than
repaid
thought
philip
as
with
a
kiss
he
disturbed
the
slumber
of
his
wife
and
met
her
full
dark
eyes
fixed
upon
him
beaming
with
love
and
joy
before
philip
went
down
stairs
he
inquired
about
mynheer
poots
my
father
has
indeed
troubled
me
much
replied
amine
i
am
obliged
to
lock
the
parlour
when
i
leave
it
for
more
than
once
i
have
found
him
attempting
to
force
the
locks
of
the
buffets
his
love
of
gold
is
insatiable
he
dreams
of
nothing
else
he
has
caused
me
much
pain
insisting
that
i
never
should
see
you
again
and
that
i
should
surrender
to
him
all
your
wealth
but
he
fears
me
and
he
fears
your
return
much
more
is
he
well
in
health
not
ill
but
still
evidently
wasting
away--like
a
candle
burnt
down
to
the
socket
flitting
and
flaring
alternately
at
one
time
almost
imbecile
at
others
talking
and
planning
as
if
he
were
in
the
vigour
of
his
youth
o
what
a
curse
it
must
be--that
love
of
money
i
believe--
i'm
shocked
to
say
so
philip--that
that
poor
old
man
now
on
the
brink
of
a
grave
into
which
he
can
take
nothing
would
sacrifice
your
life
and
mine
to
have
possession
of
those
guilders
the
whole
of
which
i
would
barter
for
one
kiss
from
thee
indeed
amine
has
he
then
attempted
anything
in
my
absence
i
dare
not
speak
my
thoughts
philip
nor
will
i
venture
upon
surmises
which
it
were
difficult
to
prove
i
watch
him
carefully--but
talk
no
more
about
him
you
will
see
him
soon
and
do
not
expect
a
hearty
welcome
or
believe
that
if
given
it
is
sincere
i
will
not
tell
him
of
your
return
as
i
wish
to
mark
the
effect
amine
then
descended
to
prepare
breakfast
and
philip
walked
out
for
a
few
minutes
on
his
return
he
found
mynheer
poots
sitting
at
the
table
with
his
daughter
merciful
allah
am
i
right
cried
the
old
man
is
it
you
mynheer
vanderdecken
even
so
replied
philip
i
returned
last
night
and
you
did
not
tell
me
amine
i
wished
that
you
should
be
surprised
replied
amine
i
am
surprised
when
do
you
sail
again
mynheer
philip
very
soon
i
suppose
perhaps
to-morrow
said
mynheer
poots
not
for
many
months
i
trust
replied
philip
not
for
many
months--that
is
a
long
while
to
be
idle
you
must
make
money
tell
me
have
you
brought
back
plenty
this
time
no
replied
philip
i
have
been
wrecked
and
very
nearly
lost
my
life
but
you
will
go
again
yes
in
good
time
i
shall
go
again
very
well
we
will
take
care
of
your
house
and
your
guilders
i
shall
perhaps
save
you
the
trouble
of
taking
care
of
my
guilders
replied
philip
to
annoy
the
old
man
for
i
mean
to
take
them
with
me
to
take
them
with
you
for
what
pray
replied
poots
in
alarm
to
purchase
goods
where
i
go
and
make
more
money
but
you
may
be
wrecked
again
and
then
the
money
will
be
all
lost
no
no
go
yourself
mynheer
philip
but
you
must
not
take
your
guilders
indeed
i
will
replied
philip
when
i
leave
this
i
shall
take
all
my
money
with
me
during
this
conversation
it
occurred
to
philip
that
if
mynheer
poots
could
only
be
led
to
suppose
that
he
took
away
his
money
with
him
there
would
be
more
quiet
for
amine
who
was
now
obliged
as
she
had
informed
him
to
be
constantly
on
the
watch
he
determined
therefore
when
he
next
departed
to
make
the
doctor
believe
that
he
had
taken
his
wealth
with
him
mynheer
poots
did
not
renew
the
conversation
but
sank
into
gloomy
thought
in
a
few
minutes
he
left
the
parlour
and
went
up
to
his
own
room
when
philip
stated
to
his
wife
what
had
induced
him
to
make
the
old
man
believe
that
he
should
embark
his
property
it
was
thoughtful
of
you
philip
and
i
thank
you
for
your
kind
feeling
towards
me
but
i
wish
you
had
said
nothing
on
the
subject
you
do
not
know
my
father
i
must
now
watch
him
as
an
enemy
we
have
little
to
fear
from
an
infirm
old
man
replied
philip
laughing
but
amine
thought
otherwise
and
was
ever
on
her
guard
the
spring
and
summer
passed
rapidly
away
for
they
were
happy
many
were
the
conversations
between
philip
and
amine
relative
to
what
had
passed--the
supernatural
appearance
of
his
father's
ship
and
the
fatal
wreck
amine
felt
that
more
dangers
and
difficulty
were
preparing
for
her
husband
but
she
never
once
attempted
to
dissuade
him
from
renewing
his
attempts
in
fulfilment
of
his
vow
like
him
she
looked
forward
with
hope
and
confidence
aware
that
at
some
time
his
fate
must
be
accomplished
and
trusting
only
that
that
hour
would
be
long
delayed
at
the
close
of
the
summer
philip
again
went
to
amsterdam
to
procure
for
himself
a
berth
in
one
of
the
vessels
which
were
to
sail
at
the
approach
of
winter
the
wreck
of
the
ter
schilling
was
well
known
and
the
circumstances
attending
it
with
the
exception
of
the
appearance
of
the
phantom
ship
had
been
drawn
up
by
philip
on
his
passage
home
and
communicated
to
the
court
of
directors
not
only
on
account
of
the
very
creditable
manner
in
which
that
report
had
been
prepared
but
in
consideration
of
his
peculiar
sufferings
and
escape
he
had
been
promised
by
the
company
a
berth
as
second
mate
on
board
of
one
of
their
vessels
should
he
be
again
inclined
to
sail
to
the
east
indies
having
called
upon
the
directors
he
received
his
appointment
to
the
batavia
a
fine
vessel
of
about
400
tons
burden
having
effected
his
purpose
philip
hastened
back
to
terneuse
and
in
the
presence
of
mynheer
poots
informed
amine
of
what
he
had
done
so
you
go
to
sea
again
observed
mynheer
poots
yes
but
not
for
two
months
i
expect
replied
philip
ah
replied
poots
in
two
months
and
the
old
man
muttered
to
himself
how
true
it
is
that
we
can
more
easily
bear
up
against
a
real
evil
than
against
suspense
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
amine
fretted
at
the
thought
of
her
approaching
separation
from
her
husband
she
lamented
it
but
feeling
his
departure
to
be
an
imperious
duty
and
having
it
ever
in
her
mind
she
bore
up
against
her
feelings
and
submitted
without
repining
to
what
could
not
be
averted
there
was
however
one
circumstance
which
caused
her
much
uneasiness--that
was
the
temper
and
conduct
of
her
father
amine
who
knew
his
character
well
perceived
that
he
already
secretly
hated
philip
whom
he
regarded
as
an
obstacle
to
his
obtaining
possession
of
the
money
in
the
house
for
the
old
man
was
well
aware
that
if
philip
were
dead
his
daughter
would
care
little
who
had
possession
of
or
what
became
of
it
the
thought
that
philip
was
about
to
take
that
money
with
him
had
almost
turned
the
brain
of
the
avaricious
old
man
he
had
been
watched
by
amine
and
she
had
seen
him
walk
for
hours
muttering
to
himself
and
not
as
usual
attending
to
his
profession
a
few
evenings
after
his
return
from
amsterdam
philip
who
had
taken
cold
complained
of
not
being
well
not
well
cried
the
old
man
starting
up
let
me
see--yes
your
pulse
is
very
quick
amine
your
poor
husband
is
very
ill
he
must
go
to
bed
and
i
will
give
him
something
which
will
do
him
good
i
shall
charge
you
nothing
philip--nothing
at
all
i
do
not
feel
so
very
unwell
mynheer
poots
replied
philip
i
have
a
bad
headache
certainly
yes
and
you
have
fever
also
philip
and
prevention
is
better
than
cure
so
go
to
bed
and
take
what
i
send
you
and
you
will
be
well
to-morrow
philip
went
up
stairs
accompanied
by
amine
and
mynheer
poots
went
into
his
own
room
to
prepare
the
medicine
so
soon
as
philip
was
in
bed
amine
went
down
stairs
and
was
met
by
her
father
who
put
a
powder
into
her
hands
to
give
to
her
husband
and
then
left
the
parlour
god
forgive
me
if
i
wrong
my
father
thought
amine
but
i
have
my
doubts
philip
is
ill
more
so
than
he
will
acknowledge
and
if
he
does
not
take
some
remedies
he
may
be
worse--but
my
heart
misgives
me--i
have
a
foreboding
yet
surely
he
cannot
be
so
diabolically
wicked
amine
examined
the
contents
of
the
paper
it
was
a
very
small
quantity
of
dark-brown
powder
and
by
the
directions
of
mynheer
poots
to
be
given
in
a
tumbler
of
warm
wine
mynheer
poots
had
offered
to
heat
the
wine
his
return
from
the
kitchen
broke
amine's
meditations
here
is
the
wine
my
child
now
give
him
a
whole
tumbler
of
wine
and
the
powder
and
let
him
be
covered
up
warm
for
the
perspiration
will
soon
burst
out
and
it
must
not
be
checked
watch
him
amine
and
keep
the
clothes
on
and
he
will
be
well
to-morrow
morning
and
mynheer
poots
quitted
the
room
saying
good
night
my
child
amine
poured
out
the
powder
into
one
of
the
silver
mugs
on
the
table
and
then
proceeded
to
mix
it
up
with
the
wine
her
suspicions
had
for
the
time
been
removed
by
the
kind
tone
of
her
father's
voice
to
do
him
justice
as
a
medical
practitioner
he
appeared
always
to
be
most
careful
of
his
patients
when
amine
mixed
the
powder
she
examined
and
perceived
that
there
was
no
sediment
and
the
wine
was
as
clear
as
before
this
was
unusual
and
her
suspicions
revived
i
like
it
not
said
she
i
fear
my
father--god
help
me--i
hardly
know
what
to
do--i
will
not
give
it
to
philip
the
warm
wine
may
produce
perspiration
sufficient
amine
paused
and
again
reflected
she
had
mixed
the
powder
with
so
small
a
portion
of
wine
that
it
did
not
fill
a
quarter
of
the
cup
she
put
it
on
one
side
filled
another
up
to
the
brim
with
the
warm
wine
and
then
went
up
to
the
bedroom
on
the
landing-place
she
was
met
by
her
father
whom
she
supposed
to
have
retired
to
rest
take
care
you
do
not
spill
it
amine
that
is
right
let
him
have
a
whole
cupful
stop
give
it
to
me
i
will
take
it
to
him
myself
mynheer
poots
took
the
cup
from
amine's
hands
and
went
into
philip's
room
here
my
son
drink
this
off
and
you
will
be
well
said
mynheer
poots
whose
hand
trembled
so
that
he
spilt
the
wine
on
the
coverlid
amine
who
watched
her
father
was
more
than
ever
pleased
that
she
had
not
put
the
powder
into
the
cup
philip
rose
on
his
elbow
drank
off
the
wine
and
mynheer
poots
then
wished
him
good
night
do
not
leave
him
amine
i
will
see
all
right
said
mynheer
poots
as
he
left
the
room
and
amine
who
had
intended
to
go
down
for
the
candle
left
in
the
parlour
remained
with
her
husband
to
whom
she
confided
her
feelings
and
also
the
fact
that
she
had
not
given
him
the
powder
i
trust
that
you
are
mistaken
amine
replied
philip
indeed
i
feel
sure
that
you
must
be
no
man
could
be
so
bad
as
you
suppose
your
father
you
have
not
lived
with
him
as
i
have--you
have
not
seen
what
i
have
seen
replied
amine
you
know
not
what
gold
will
tempt
people
to
do
in
this
world--but
however
i
may
be
wrong
at
all
events
you
must
go
to
sleep
and
i
shall
watch
you
dearest
pray
do
not
speak--i
feel
i
cannot
sleep
just
now--i
wish
to
read
a
little--i
will
lie
down
by-and-by
philip
made
no
further
objections
and
was
soon
in
a
sound
sleep
and
amine
watched
him
in
silence
till
midnight
long
had
passed
he
breathes
heavily
thought
amine
but
had
i
given
him
that
powder
who
knows
if
he
had
ever
awoke
again
my
father
is
so
deeply
skilled
in
the
eastern
knowledge
that
i
fear
him
too
often
has
he
i
well
know
for
a
purse
well
filled
with
gold
prepared
the
sleep
of
death
another
would
shudder
at
the
thought
but
he
who
has
dealt
out
death
at
the
will
of
his
employers
would
scruple
little
to
do
so
even
to
the
husband
of
his
own
daughter
and
i
have
watched
him
in
his
moods
and
know
his
thoughts
and
wishes
what
a
foreboding
of
mishap
has
come
over
me
this
evening--what
a
fear
of
evil
philip
is
ill
'tis
true
but
not
so
very
ill
no
no
besides
his
time
is
not
yet
come
he
has
his
dreadful
task
to
finish
i
would
it
were
morning
how
soundly
he
sleeps--and
the
dew
is
on
his
brow
i
must
cover
him
up
warm
and
watch
that
he
remains
so
some
one
knocks
at
the
entrance-door
now
will
they
wake
him
'tis
a
summons
for
my
father
amine
left
the
room
and
hastened
down
stairs
it
was
as
she
supposed
a
summons
for
mynheer
poots
to
a
woman
taken
in
labour
he
shall
follow
you
directly
said
amine
i
will
now
call
him
up
amine
went
up
stairs
to
the
room
where
her
father
slept
and
knocked
hearing
no
answer
as
usual
she
knocked
again
my
father
is
not
used
to
sleep
in
this
way
thought
amine
when
she
found
no
answer
to
her
second
call
she
opened
the
door
and
went
in
to
her
surprise
her
father
was
not
in
bed
strange
thought
she
but
i
do
not
recollect
having
heard
his
footsteps
coming
up
after
he
went
down
to
take
away
the
lights
and
amine
hastened
to
the
parlour
where
stretched
on
the
sofa
she
discovered
her
father
apparently
fast
asleep
but
to
her
call
he
gave
no
answer
merciful
heaven
is
he
dead
thought
she
approaching
the
light
to
her
father's
face
yes
it
was
so--his
eyes
were
fixed
and
glazed--his
lower
jaw
had
fallen
for
some
minutes
amine
leant
against
the
wall
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
her
brain
whirled
at
last
she
recovered
herself
'tis
to
be
proved
at
once
thought
she
as
she
went
up
to
the
table
and
looked
into
the
silver
cup
in
which
she
had
mixed
the
powder--it
was
empty
the
god
of
righteousness
hath
punished
him
exclaimed
amine
but
o
that
this
man
should
have
been
my
father
yes
it
is
plain
frightened
at
his
own
wicked
damned
intentions
he
poured
out
more
wine
from
the
flagon
to
blunt
his
feelings
of
remorse
and
not
knowing
that
the
powder
was
still
in
the
cup
he
filled
it
up
and
drank
himself--the
death
he
meant
for
another
for
another--and
for
whom
one
wedded
to
his
own
daughter--philip
my
husband
wert
thou
not
my
father
continued
amine
looking
at
the
dead
body
i
would
spit
upon
thee
and
curse
thee--but
thou
art
punished
and
may
god
forgive
thee
thou
poor
weak
wicked
creature
amine
then
left
the
room
and
went
up
stairs
where
she
found
philip
still
fast
asleep
and
in
a
profuse
perspiration
most
women
would
have
awakened
their
husbands
but
amine
thought
not
of
herself
philip
was
ill
and
amine
would
not
arouse
him
to
agitate
him
she
sat
down
by
the
side
of
the
bed
and
with
her
hands
pressed
upon
her
forehead
and
her
elbows
resting
on
her
knees
she
remained
in
deep
thought
until
the
sun
had
risen
and
poured
his
bright
beams
through
the
casement
she
was
roused
from
her
reflections
by
another
summons
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
she
hastened
down
to
the
entrance
but
did
not
open
the
door
mynheer
poots
is
required
immediately
said
the
girl
who
was
the
messenger
my
good
therese
replied
amine
my
father
has
more
need
of
assistance
than
the
poor
woman
for
his
travail
in
this
world
i
fear
is
well
over
i
found
him
very
ill
when
i
went
to
call
him
and
he
has
not
been
able
to
quit
his
bed
i
must
now
entreat
you
to
do
my
message
and
desire
father
seysen
to
come
hither
for
my
poor
father
is
i
fear
in
extremity
mercy
on
me
replied
therese
is
it
so
fear
not
but
i
will
do
your
bidding
mistress
amine
the
second
knocking
had
awakened
philip
who
felt
that
he
was
much
better
and
his
headache
had
left
him
he
perceived
that
amine
had
not
taken
any
rest
that
night
and
he
was
about
to
expostulate
with
her
when
she
at
once
told
him
what
had
occurred
you
must
dress
yourself
philip
continued
she
and
must
assist
me
to
carry
up
his
body
and
place
it
in
his
bed
before
the
arrival
of
the
priest
god
of
mercy
had
i
given
you
that
powder
my
dearest
philip--
but
let
us
not
talk
about
it
be
quick
for
father
seysen
will
be
here
soon
philip
was
soon
dressed
and
followed
amine
down
into
the
parlour
the
sun
shone
bright
and
its
rays
were
darted
upon
the
haggard
face
of
the
old
man
whose
fists
were
clenched
and
his
tongue
fixed
between
the
teeth
on
one
side
of
his
mouth
alas
this
room
appears
to
be
fatal
how
many
more
scenes
of
horror
are
to
pass
within
it
none
i
trust
replied
amine
this
is
not
to
my
mind
the
scene
of
horror
it
was
when
that
old
man
now
called
away--and
a
victim
to
his
own
treachery
stood
by
your
bed-side
and
with
every
mark
of
interest
and
kindness
offered
you
the
cup--that
was
the
scene
of
horror
said
amine
shuddering--one
which
long
will
haunt
me
god
forgive
him
as
i
do
replied
philip
lifting
up
the
body
and
carrying
it
up
the
stairs
to
the
room
which
had
been
occupied
by
mynheer
poots
let
it
at
least
be
supposed
that
he
died
in
his
bed
and
that
his
death
was
natural
said
amine
my
pride
cannot
bear
that
this
should
be
known
or
that
i
should
be
pointed
at
as
the
daughter
of
a
murderer
o
philip
amine
sat
down
and
burst
into
tears
her
husband
was
attempting
to
console
her
when
father
seysen
knocked
at
the
door
philip
hastened
down
to
open
it
good
morning
my
son
how
is
the
sufferer
he
has
ceased
to
suffer
father
indeed
replied
the
good
priest
with
sorrow
in
his
countenance
am
i
then
too
late
yet
have
i
not
tarried
he
went
off
suddenly
father
in
a
convulsion
replied
philip
leading
the
way
up
stairs
father
seysen
looked
at
the
body
and
perceived
that
his
offices
were
needless
and
then
turned
to
amine
who
had
not
yet
checked
her
tears
weep
my
child
weep
for
you
have
cause
said
the
priest
the
loss
of
a
father's
love
must
be
a
severe
trial
to
a
dutiful
and
affectionate
child
but
yield
not
too
much
to
your
grief
amine
you
have
other
duties
other
ties
my
child--you
have
your
husband
i
know
it
father
replied
amine
still
must
i
weep
for
i
was
his
daughter
did
he
not
go
to
bed
last
night
then
that
his
clothes
are
still
upon
him
when
did
he
first
complain
the
last
time
that
i
saw
him
father
replied
philip
he
came
into
my
room
and
gave
me
some
medicine
and
then
he
wished
me
good
night
upon
on
a
summons
to
attend
a
sick
bed
my
wife
went
to
call
him
and
found
him
speechless
it
has
been
sudden
replied
the
priest
but
he
was
an
old
man
and
old
men
sink
at
once
were
you
with
him
when
he
died
i
was
not
sir
replied
philip
before
my
wife
had
summoned
me
and
i
had
dressed
myself
he
had
left
this
world
i
trust
my
children
for
a
better
amine
shuddered
tell
me
amine
continued
the
priest
did
he
show
signs
of
grace
before
he
died
for
you
know
full
well
that
he
has
long
been
looked
on
as
doubtful
in
his
creed
and
little
attentive
to
the
rites
of
our
holy
church
there
are
times
holy
father
replied
amine
when
even
a
sincere
christian
can
be
excused
even
if
he
give
no
sign
look
at
his
clenched
hands
witness
the
agony
of
death
on
his
face
and
could
you
in
that
state
expect
a
sign
alas
'tis
but
too
true
my
child
we
must
then
hope
for
the
best
kneel
with
me
my
children
and
let
us
offer
up
a
prayer
for
the
soul
of
the
departed
philip
and
amine
knelt
with
the
priest
who
prayed
fervently
and
as
they
rose
they
exchanged
a
glance
which
fully
revealed
what
was
passing
in
the
mind
of
each
i
will
send
the
people
to
do
their
offices
for
the
dead
and
prepare
the
body
for
interment
said
father
seysen
but
it
were
as
well
not
to
say
that
he
was
dead
before
i
arrived
or
to
let
it
he
supposed
that
he
was
called
away
without
receiving
the
consolations
of
our
holy
creed
philip
motioned
his
head
in
assent
as
he
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
the
priest
departed
there
had
always
been
a
strong
feeling
against
mynheer
poots
in
the
village--his
neglect
of
all
religious
duties--the
doubt
whether
he
was
even
a
member
of
the
church--his
avarice
and
extortion--had
created
for
him
a
host
of
enemies
but
at
the
same
time
his
great
medical
skill
which
was
fully
acknowledged
rendered
him
of
importance
had
it
been
known
that
his
creed
if
he
had
any
was
mahomedan
and
that
he
had
died
in
attempting
to
poison
his
son-in-law
it
is
certain
that
christian
burial
would
have
been
refused
him
and
the
finger
of
scorn
would
have
been
pointed
at
his
daughter
but
as
father
seysen
when
questioned
said
in
a
mild
voice
that
he
had
departed
in
peace
it
was
presumed
that
mynheer
poots
had
died
a
good
christian
although
he
had
acted
little
up
to
the
tenets
of
christianity
during
his
life
the
next
day
the
remains
of
the
old
man
were
consigned
to
the
earth
with
the
usual
rites
and
philip
and
amine
were
not
a
little
relieved
in
their
minds
at
everything
having
passed
off
so
quietly
it
was
not
until
after
the
funeral
had
taken
place
that
philip
in
company
with
amine
examined
the
chamber
of
his
father-in-law
the
key
of
the
iron
chest
was
found
in
his
pocket
but
philip
had
not
yet
looked
into
this
darling
repository
of
the
old
man
the
room
was
full
of
bottles
and
boxes
of
drugs
all
of
which
were
either
thrown
away
or
if
the
utility
of
them
was
known
to
amine
removed
to
a
spare
room
his
table
contained
many
drawers
which
were
now
examined
and
among
the
heterogeneous
contents
were
many
writings
in
arabic--probably
prescriptions
boxes
and
papers
were
also
found
with
arabic
characters
written
upon
them
and
in
the
box
which
they
first
took
up
was
a
powder
similar
to
that
which
mynheer
poots
had
given
to
amine
there
were
many
articles
and
writings
which
made
it
appear
that
the
old
man
had
dabbled
in
the
occult
sciences
as
they
were
practised
at
that
period
and
those
they
hastened
to
commit
to
the
flames
had
all
these
been
seen
by
father
seysen
observed
amine
mournfully
but
here
are
some
printed
papers
philip
philip
examined
them
and
found
that
they
were
acknowledgments
of
shares
in
the
dutch
east-india
company
no
amine
these
are
money
or
what
is
as
good--these
are
eight
shares
in
the
company's
capital
which
will
yield
us
a
handsome
income
every
year
i
had
no
idea
that
the
old
man
made
such
use
of
his
money
i
had
some
intention
of
doing
the
same
with
a
part
of
mine
before
i
went
away
instead
of
allowing
it
to
remain
idle
the
iron
chest
was
now
to
be
examined
when
philip
first
opened
it
he
imagined
that
it
contained
but
little
for
it
was
large
and
deep
and
appeared
to
be
almost
empty
but
when
he
put
his
hands
down
to
the
bottom
he
pulled
out
thirty
or
forty
small
bags
the
contents
of
which
instead
of
being
silver
guilders
were
all
coins
of
gold
there
was
only
one
large
bag
of
silver
money
but
this
was
not
all
several
small
boxes
and
packets
were
also
discovered
which
when
opened
were
found
to
contain
diamonds
and
other
precious
stones
when
everything
was
collected
the
treasure
appeared
to
be
of
great
value
amine
my
love
you
have
indeed
brought
me
an
unexpected
dower
said
philip
you
may
well
say
unexpected
replied
amine
these
diamonds
and
jewels
my
father
must
have
brought
with
him
from
egypt
and
yet
how
penuriously
were
we
living
until
we
came
to
this
cottage
and
with
all
this
treasure
he
would
have
poisoned
my
philip
for
more
god
forgive
him
having
counted
the
gold
which
amounted
to
nearly
fifty
thousand
guilders
the
whole
was
replaced
and
they
left
the
room
i
am
a
rich
man
thought
philip
after
amine
had
left
him
but
of
what
use
are
riches
to
me
i
might
purchase
a
ship
and
be
my
own
captain
but
would
not
the
ship
be
lost
that
certainly
does
not
follow
but
the
chances
are
against
the
vessel
therefore
i
will
have
no
ship
but
is
it
right
to
sail
in
the
vessels
of
others
with
this
feeling--i
know
not
this
however
i
know
that
i
have
a
duty
to
perform
and
that
all
our
lives
are
in
the
hands
of
a
kind
providence
which
calls
us
away
when
it
thinks
fit
i
will
place
most
of
my
money
in
the
shares
of
the
company
and
if
i
sail
in
their
vessels
and
they
come
to
misfortune
by
meeting
with
my
poor
father
at
least
i
shall
be
a
common
sufferer
with
the
rest
and
now
to
make
my
amine
more
comfortable
philip
immediately
made
a
great
alteration
in
their
style
of
living
two
female
servants
were
hired
the
rooms
were
more
comfortably
furnished
and
in
everything
in
which
his
wife's
comfort
and
convenience
were
concerned
he
spared
no
expense
he
wrote
to
amsterdam
and
purchased
several
shares
in
the
company's
stock
the
diamonds
and
his
own
money
he
still
left
in
the
hands
of
amine
in
making
these
arrangements
the
two
months
passed
rapidly
away
and
everything
was
complete
when
philip
again
received
his
summons
by
letter
to
desire
that
he
would
join
his
vessel
amine
would
have
wished
philip
to
go
out
as
a
passenger
instead
of
going
as
an
officer
but
philip
preferred
the
latter
as
otherwise
he
could
give
no
reason
for
his
voyage
to
india
i
know
not
why
observed
philip
the
evening
before
his
departure
but
i
do
not
feel
as
i
did
when
i
last
went
away
i
have
no
foreboding
of
evil
this
time
nor
have
i
replied
amine
but
i
feel
as
if
you
would
be
long
away
from
me
philip
and
is
not
that
an
evil
to
a
fond
and
anxious
wife
yes
love
it
is
but--
o
yes
i
know
it
is
your
duty
and
you
must
go
replied
amine
burying
her
face
in
his
bosom
the
next
day
philip
parted
from
his
wife
who
behaved
with
more
fortitude
than
on
their
first
separation
all
were
lost
but
he
was
saved
thought
amine
i
feel
that
he
will
return
to
me
god
of
heaven
thy
will
be
done
philip
soon
arrived
at
amsterdam
and
having
purchased
many
things
which
he
thought
might
be
advantageous
to
him
in
case
of
accident
to
which
he
now
looked
forward
as
almost
certain
he
embarked
on
board
the
batavia
which
was
lying
at
single
anchor
and
ready
for
sea
philip
had
not
been
long
on
board
ere
he
found
that
they
were
not
likely
to
have
a
very
comfortable
passage
for
the
batavia
was
chartered
to
convey
a
large
detachment
of
troops
to
ceylon
and
java
for
the
purpose
of
recruiting
and
strengthening
the
company's
forces
at
those
places
she
was
to
quit
the
fleet
off
madagascar
and
run
direct
for
the
island
of
java
the
number
of
soldiers
on
board
being
presumed
sufficient
to
insure
the
ship
against
any
attack
or
accidents
from
pirates
or
enemies'
cruisers
the
batavia
moreover
mounted
thirty
guns
and
had
a
crew
of
seventy-five
men
besides
military
stores
which
formed
the
principal
part
of
her
cargo
she
had
on
board
a
large
quantity
of
specie
for
the
indian
market
the
detachment
of
soldiers
was
embarking
when
philip
went
on
board
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
decks
were
so
crowded
that
it
was
hardly
possible
to
move
philip
who
had
not
yet
spoken
to
the
captain
found
out
the
first
mate
and
immediately
entered
upon
his
duty
with
which
from
his
close
application
to
it
during
his
former
voyage
and
passage
home
he
was
much
better
acquainted
than
might
have
been
imagined
in
a
short
time
all
traces
of
hurry
and
confusion
began
to
disappear
the
baggage
of
the
troops
was
stowed
away
and
the
soldiers
having
been
told
off
in
parties
and
stationed
with
their
messing
utensils
between
the
guns
of
the
main
deck
room
was
thus
afforded
for
working
the
ship
philip
showed
great
activity
as
well
as
method
in
the
arrangements
proposed
and
the
captain
during
a
pause
in
his
own
arduous
duties
said
to
him--
i
thought
you
were
taking
it
very
easy
mr
vanderdecken
in
not
joining
the
ship
before
but
now
you
are
on
board
you
are
making
up
for
lost
time
you
have
done
more
during
the
forenoon
than
i
could
have
expected
i
am
glad
that
you
are
come
though
very
sorry
you
were
not
here
when
we
were
stowing
the
hold
which
i
am
afraid
is
not
arranged
quite
so
well
as
it
might
be
mynheer
struys
the
first
mate
has
had
more
to
do
than
he
could
well
give
attention
to
i
am
sorry
that
i
should
not
have
been
here
sir
replied
philip
but
i
came
as
soon
as
the
company
sent
me
word
yes
and
as
they
know
that
you
are
a
married
man
and
do
not
forget
that
you
are
a
great
shareholder
they
would
not
trouble
you
too
soon
i
presume
you
will
have
the
command
of
a
vessel
next
voyage
in
fact
you
are
certain
of
it
with
the
capital
you
have
invested
in
their
funds
i
had
a
conversation
with
one
of
the
senior
accountants
on
the
subject
this
very
morning
philip
was
not
very
sorry
that
his
money
had
been
put
out
to
such
good
interest
as
to
be
the
captain
of
a
ship
was
what
he
earnestly
desired
he
replied
that
he
certainly
did
hope
to
command
a
ship
after
the
next
voyage
when
he
trusted
that
he
should
feel
himself
quite
competent
to
the
charge
no
doubt
no
doubt
mr
vanderdecken
i
can
see
that
clearly
you
must
be
very
fond
of
the
sea
i
am
replied
philip
i
doubt
whether
i
shall
ever
give
it
up
never
give
it
up
you
think
so
now
you
are
young
active
and
full
of
hope
but
you
will
tire
of
it
by
and
bye
and
be
glad
to
lay
by
for
the
rest
of
your
days
how
many
troops
do
we
embark
inquired
philip
two
hundred
and
forty-five
rank
and
file
and
six
officers
poor
fellows
there
are
but
few
of
them
will
ever
return
nay
more
than
one-half
will
not
see
another
birthday
it
is
a
dreadful
climate
i
have
landed
three
hundred
men
at
that
horrid
hole
and
in
six
months
even
before
i
had
sailed
there
were
not
one
hundred
left
alive
it
is
almost
murder
to
send
them
there
observed
philip
pshaw
they
must
die
somewhere
and
if
they
die
a
little
sooner
what
matter
life
is
a
commodity
to
be
bought
and
sold
like
any
other
we
send
out
so
much
manufactured
goods
and
so
much
money
to
barter
for
indian
commodities
we
also
send
out
so
much
life
and
it
gives
a
good
return
to
the
company
but
not
to
the
poor
soldiers
i
am
afraid
no
the
company
buy
it
cheap
and
sell
it
dear
replied
the
captain
who
walked
forward
true
thought
philip
they
do
purchase
human
life
cheap
and
make
a
rare
profit
of
it
for
without
these
poor
fellows
how
could
they
hold
their
possessions
in
spite
of
native
and
foreign
enemies
for
what
a
paltry
and
cheap
annuity
do
these
men
sell
their
lives
for
what
a
miserable
pittance
do
they
dare
all
the
horrors
of
a
most
deadly
climate
without
a
chance
a
hope
of
return
to
their
native
land
where
they
might
haply
repair
their
exhausted
energies
and
take
a
new
lease
of
life
good
god
if
these
men
may
be
thus
heartlessly
sacrificed
to
mammon
why
should
i
feel
remorse
if
in
the
fulfilment
of
a
sacred
duty
imposed
on
me
by
him
who
deals
with
us
as
he
thinks
meet
a
few
mortals
perish
not
a
sparrow
fails
to
the
ground
without
his
knowledge
and
it
is
for
him
to
sacrifice
or
to
save
i
am
but
the
creature
of
his
will
and
i
but
follow
my
duty--but
obey
the
commands
of
one
whose
ways
are
inscrutable
still
if
for
my
sake
this
ship
be
also
doomed
i
cannot
but
wish
that
i
had
been
appointed
to
some
other
in
which
the
waste
of
human
life
might
have
been
less
it
was
not
until
a
week
after
philip
arrived
on
board
that
the
batavia
and
the
remainder
of
the
fleet
were
ready
for
sea
it
would
be
difficult
to
analyse
the
feelings
of
philip
vanderdecken
on
this
his
second
embarkation
his
mind
was
so
continually
directed
to
the
object
of
his
voyage
that
although
he
attended
to
his
religious
duty
yet
the
business
of
life
passed
before
him
as
a
dream
assured
of
again
meeting
with
the
phantom
ship
and
almost
equally
assured
that
the
meeting
would
be
followed
by
some
untoward
event
in
all
probability
by
the
sacrifice
of
those
who
sailed
with
him
his
thoughts
preyed
upon
him
and
wore
him
down
to
a
shadow
he
hardly
ever
spoke
except
in
the
execution
of
his
duty
he
felt
like
a
criminal
as
one
who
by
embarking
with
them
had
doomed
all
around
him
to
death
disaster
and
peril
and
when
one
talked
of
his
wife
and
another
of
his
children--when
they
would
indulge
in
anticipations
and
canvass
happy
projects
philip
would
feel
sick
at
heart
and
would
rise
from
the
table
and
hasten
to
the
solitude
of
the
deck
at
one
time
he
would
try
to
persuade
himself
that
his
senses
had
been
worked
upon
in
some
moment
of
excitement
that
he
was
the
victim
of
an
illusion
at
another
he
would
call
to
mind
all
the
past--he
would
feel
its
terrible
reality
and
then
the
thought
would
suggest
itself
that
with
this
supernatural
vision
heaven
had
nothing
to
do
that
it
was
but
the
work
and
jugglery
of
satan
but
then
the
relic--by
such
means
the
devil
would
not
have
worked
a
few
days
after
he
had
sailed
he
bitterly
repented
that
he
had
not
stated
the
whole
of
his
circumstances
to
father
seysen
and
taken
his
advice
upon
the
propriety
of
following
up
his
search
but
it
was
now
too
late
already
was
the
good
ship
batavia
more
than
a
thousand
miles
from
the
port
of
amsterdam
and
his
duty
whatever
it
might
be
must
be
fulfilled
as
the
fleet
approached
the
cape
his
anxiety
increased
to
such
a
degree
that
it
was
remarked
by
all
who
were
on
board
the
captain
and
officers
commanding
the
troops
embarked
who
all
felt
interested
in
him
vainly
attempted
to
learn
the
cause
of
his
anxiety
philip
would
plead
ill
health
and
his
haggard
countenance
and
sunken
eyes
silently
proved
that
he
was
under
acute
suffering
the
major
part
of
the
night
he
passed
on
deck
straining
his
eyes
in
every
quarter
and
watching
each
change
in
the
horizon
in
anticipation
of
the
appearance
of
the
phantom
ship
and
it
was
not
till
the
day
dawned
that
he
sought
a
perturbed
repose
in
his
cabin
after
a
favourable
passage
the
fleet
anchored
to
refresh
at
table
bay
and
philip
felt
some
small
relief
that
up
to
the
present
time
the
supernatural
visitation
had
not
again
occurred
as
soon
as
the
fleet
had
watered
they
again
made
sail
and
again
did
philip's
agitation
become
perceptible
with
a
favouring
breeze
however
they
rounded
the
cape
passed
by
madagascar
and
arrived
in
the
indian
seas
when
the
batavia
parted
company
with
the
rest
of
the
fleet
which
steered
to
cambroon
and
ceylon
and
now
thought
philip
will
the
phantom
ship
make
her
appearance
it
has
only
waited
till
we
should
be
left
without
a
consort
to
assist
us
in
distress
but
the
batavia
sailed
in
a
smooth
sea
and
under
a
cloudless
sky
and
nothing
was
seen
in
a
few
weeks
she
arrived
off
java
and
previous
to
entering
the
splendid
roads
of
batavia
hove-to
for
the
night
this
was
the
last
night
they
would
be
under
sail
and
philip
stirred
not
from
the
deck
but
walked
to
and
fro
anxiously
waiting
for
the
morning
the
morning
broke--the
sun
rose
in
splendour
and
the
batavia
steered
into
the
roads
before
noon
she
was
at
anchor
and
philip
with
his
mind
relieved
hastened
down
to
his
cabin
and
took
that
repose
which
he
so
much
required
he
awoke
refreshed
for
a
great
weight
had
been
taken
off
his
mind
it
does
not
follow
then
thought
he
that
because
i
am
on
board
the
vessel
that
therefore
the
crew
are
doomed
to
perish
it
does
not
follow
that
the
phantom
ship
is
to
appear
because
i
seek
her
if
so
i
have
no
further
weight
upon
my
conscience
i
seek
her
it
is
true
and
wish
to
meet
with
her
i
stand
however
but
the
same
chance
as
others
and
it
is
no
way
certain
that
because
i
seek
i
am
sure
to
find
that
she
brings
disaster
upon
all
she
meets
may
be
true
but
not
that
i
bring
with
me
the
disaster
of
meeting
her
heaven
i
thank
thee
now
can
i
prosecute
my
search
without
remorse
philip
restored
to
composure
by
these
reflections
went
on
deck
the
debarkation
of
the
troops
was
already
taking
place
for
they
were
as
anxious
to
be
relieved
from
their
long
confinement
as
the
seamen
were
to
regain
a
little
space
and
comfort
he
surveyed
the
scene
the
town
of
batavia
lay
about
one
mile
from
them
low
on
the
beach
from
behind
it
rose
a
lofty
chain
of
mountains
brilliant
with
verdure
and
here
and
there
peopled
with
country
seats
belonging
to
the
residents
delightfully
embosomed
in
forests
of
trees
the
panorama
was
beautiful
the
vegetation
was
luxuriant
and
from
its
vivid
green
refreshing
to
the
eye
near
to
the
town
lay
large
and
small
vessels
a
forest
of
masts
the
water
in
the
bay
was
of
a
bright
blue
and
rippled
to
a
soft
breeze
here
and
there
small
islets
like
tufts
of
fresh
verdure
broke
the
uniformity
of
the
waterline
even
the
town
itself
was
pleasing
to
the
eye
the
white
colour
of
the
houses
being
opposed
to
the
dark
foliage
of
the
trees
which
grew
in
the
gardens
and
lined
the
streets
can
it
be
possible
observed
philip
to
the
captain
of
the
batavia
who
stood
by
him
that
this
beautiful
spot
can
be
so
unhealthy
i
should
form
a
very
different
opinion
from
its
appearance
even
replied
the
captain
as
the
venomous
snakes
of
the
country
start
up
from
among
its
flowers
so
does
death
stalk
about
in
this
beautiful
and
luxuriant
landscape
do
you
feel
better
mynheer
vanderdecken
much
better
replied
philip
still
in
your
enfeebled
state
i
should
recommend
you
to
go
on
shore
i
shall
avail
myself
of
your
permission
with
thanks
how
long
shall
we
stay
here
not
long
as
we
are
ordered
to
run
back
our
cargo
is
all
ready
for
us
and
will
be
on
board
soon
after
we
have
discharged
philip
took
the
advice
of
his
captain
he
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
himself
received
by
a
hospitable
merchant
who
had
a
house
at
some
distance
from
the
town
and
in
a
healthy
situation
there
he
remained
two
months
during
which
he
re-established
his
health
and
then
re-embarked
a
few
days
previous
to
the
ship
being
ready
for
sea
the
return
voyage
was
fortunate
and
in
four
months
from
the
date
of
their
quitting
batavia
they
found
themselves
abreast
of
st
helena
for
vessels
at
that
period
generally
made
what
is
called
the
eastern
passage
running
down
the
coast
of
africa
instead
of
keeping
towards
the
american
shores
again
they
had
passed
the
cape
without
meeting
with
the
phantom
ship
and
philip
was
not
only
in
excellent
health
but
in
good
spirits
as
they
lay
becalmed
with
the
island
in
sight
they
observed
a
boat
pulling
towards
them
and
in
the
course
of
three
hours
she
arrived
on
board
the
crew
were
much
exhausted
from
having
been
two
days
in
the
boat
during
which
time
they
had
never
ceased
pulling
to
gain
the
island
they
stated
themselves
to
be
the
crew
of
a
small
dutch
indiaman
which
had
foundered
at
sea
two
days
before
she
had
started
one
of
her
planks
and
filled
so
rapidly
that
the
men
had
hardly
time
to
save
themselves
they
consisted
of
the
captain
mates
and
twenty
men
belonging
to
the
ship
and
an
old
portuguese
catholic
priest
who
had
been
sent
home
by
the
dutch
governor
for
having
opposed
the
dutch
interests
in
the
island
of
japan
he
had
lived
with
the
natives
and
been
secreted
by
them
for
some
time
as
the
japanese
government
was
equally
desirous
of
capturing
him
with
the
intention
of
taking
away
his
life
eventually
he
found
himself
obliged
to
throw
himself
into
the
arms
of
the
dutch
as
being
the
less
cruel
of
his
enemies
the
dutch
government
decided
that
he
should
be
sent
away
from
the
country
and
he
had
in
consequence
been
put
on
board
of
the
indiaman
for
a
passage
home
by
the
report
of
the
captain
and
crew
one
person
only
had
been
lost
but
he
was
a
person
of
consequence
having
for
many
years
held
the
situation
of
president
in
the
dutch
factory
in
japan
he
was
returning
to
holland
with
the
riches
which
he
had
amassed
by
the
evidence
of
the
captain
and
crew
he
had
insisted
after
he
was
put
into
the
boat
upon
going
back
to
the
ship
to
secure
a
casket
of
immense
value
containing
diamonds
and
other
precious
stones
which
he
had
forgotten
they
added
that
while
they
were
waiting
for
him
the
ship
suddenly
plunged
her
bowsprit
under
and
went
down
head
foremost
and
that
it
was
with
difficulty
they
had
themselves
escaped
they
had
waited
for
some
time
to
ascertain
if
he
would
rise
again
to
the
surface
but
he
appeared
no
more
i
knew
that
something
would
happen
observed
the
captain
of
the
sunken
vessel
after
he
had
been
sitting
a
short
time
in
the
cabin
with
philip
and
the
captain
of
the
batavia
we
saw
the
fiend
or
devil's
ship
as
they
call
her
but
three
days
before
what
the
flying
dutchman
as
they
name
her
asked
philip
yes
that
i
believe
is
the
name
they
give
her
replied
the
captain
i
have
often
heard
of
her
but
it
never
was
my
fate
to
fall
in
with
her
before
and
i
hope
it
never
will
be
again
for
i
am
a
ruined
man
and
must
begin
the
world
afresh
i
have
heard
of
that
vessel
observed
the
captain
of
the
batavia
pray
how
did
she
appear
to
you
why
the
fact
is
i
did
not
see
anything
but
the
loom
of
her
hull
replied
the
other
it
was
very
strange
the
night
was
fine
and
the
heavens
clear
we
were
under
top-gallant
sails
for
i
do
not
carry
on
during
the
night
or
else
we
might
have
put
the
royals
on
her
she
would
have
carried
them
with
the
breeze
i
had
turned
in
when
about
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
the
mate
called
me
to
come
on
deck
i
demanded
what
was
the
matter
and
he
replied
he
could
hardly
tell
but
that
the
men
were
much
frightened
and
that
there
was
a
ghost
ship
as
the
sailors
termed
it
in
sight
i
went
on
deck
all
the
horizon
was
clear
but
on
our
quarter
was
a
sort
of
fog
round
as
a
ball
and
not
more
than
two
cables'
length
from
us
we
were
going
about
four
knots
and
a
half
free
and
yet
we
could
not
escape
from
this
mist
look
there'
said
the
mate
why
what
the
devil
can
it
be'
said
i
rubbing
my
eyes
no
banks
up
to
windward
and
yet
a
fog
in
the
middle
of
a
clear
sky
with
a
fresh
breeze
and
with
water
all
around
it'
for
you
see
the
fog
did
not
cover
more
than
half
a
dozen
cables'
length
as
we
could
perceive
by
the
horizon
on
each
side
of
it
hark
sir'
said
the
mate--they
are
speaking
again'
speaking'
said
i
and
i
listened
and
from
out
this
ball
of
fog
i
heard
voices
at
last
one
cried
out
keep
a
sharp
look
out
forward
d'ye
hear'
ay
ay
sir'
replied
another
voice
ship
on
the
starboard
bow
sir'
very
well
strike
the
bell
there
forward'
and
then
we
heard
the
bell
toll
it
must
be
a
vessel'
said
i
to
the
mate
not
of
this
world
sir'
replied
he
hark'
a
gun
ready
forward'
ay
ay
sir'
was
now
heard
out
of
the
fog
which
appeared
to
near
us
all
ready
sir'
fire'
the
report
of
the
gun
sounded
in
our
ears
like
thunder
and
then--
well
and
then
said
the
captain
of
the
batavia
breathless
and
then
replied
the
other
captain
solemnly
the
fog
and
all
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
the
whole
horizon
was
clear
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
is
it
possible
there
are
twenty
men
on
deck
to
tell
the
story
replied
the
captain
and
the
old
catholic
priest
to
boot
for
he
stood
by
me
the
whole
time
i
was
on
deck
the
men
said
that
some
accident
would
happen
and
in
the
morning
watch
on
sounding
the
well
we
found
four
feet
water
we
took
to
the
pumps
but
it
gained
upon
us
and
we
went
down
as
i
have
told
you
the
mate
says
that
the
vessel
is
well
known--it
is
called
the
flying
dutchman
philip
made
no
remarks
at
the
time
but
he
was
much
pleased
at
what
he
had
heard
if
thought
he
the
phantom
ship
of
my
poor
father
appears
to
others
as
well
as
to
me
and
they
are
sufferers
my
being
on
board
can
make
no
difference
i
do
but
take
my
chance
of
falling
in
with
her
and
do
not
risk
the
lives
of
those
who
sail
in
the
same
vessel
with
me
now
my
mind
is
relieved
and
i
can
prosecute
my
search
with
a
quiet
conscience
the
next
day
philip
took
an
opportunity
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
the
catholic
priest
who
spoke
dutch
and
other
languages
as
well
as
he
did
portuguese
he
was
a
venerable
old
man
apparently
about
sixty
years
of
age
with
a
white
flowing
beard
mild
in
his
demeanour
and
very
pleasing
in
his
conversation
when
philip
kept
his
watch
that
night
the
old
man
walked
with
him
and
it
was
then
after
a
long
conversation
that
philip
confided
to
him
that
he
was
of
the
catholic
persuasion
indeed
my
son
that
is
unusual
in
a
hollander
it
is
so
replied
philip
nor
is
it
known
on
board--not
that
i
am
ashamed
of
my
religion
but
i
wish
to
avoid
discussion
you
are
prudent
my
son
alas
if
the
reformed
religion
produces
no
better
fruit
than
what
i
have
witnessed
in
the
east
it
is
little
better
than
idolatry
tell
me
father
said
philip--they
talk
of
a
miraculous
vision--of
a
ship
not
manned
by
mortal
men
did
you
see
it
i
saw
what
others
saw
replied
the
priest
and
certainly
as
far
as
my
senses
would
enable
me
to
judge
the
appearance
was
most
unusual--i
may
say
supernatural
but
i
had
heard
of
this
phantom
ship
before
and
moreover
that
its
appearance
was
the
precursor
of
disaster
so
did
it
prove
in
our
case
although
indeed
we
had
one
on
board
now
no
more
whose
weight
of
guilt
was
more
than
sufficient
to
sink
any
vessel
one
the
swallowing
up
of
whom
with
all
that
wealth
from
which
he
anticipated
such
enjoyment
in
his
own
country
has
manifested
that
the
almighty
will
even
in
this
world
sometimes
wreak
just
and
awful
retribution
on
those
who
have
merited
his
vengeance
you
refer
to
the
dutch
president
who
went
down
with
the
ship
when
it
sank
i
do
but
the
tale
of
that
man's
crime
is
long
to-morrow
night
i
will
walk
with
you
and
narrate
the
whole
peace
be
with
you
my
son
and
good
night
the
weather
continued
fine
and
the
batavia
hove-to
in
the
evening
with
the
intention
of
anchoring
the
next
morning
in
the
roadstead
of
st
helena
philip
when
he
went
on
deck
to
keep
the
middle
watch
found
the
old
priest
at
the
gangway
waiting
for
him
in
the
ship
all
was
quiet
the
men
slumbered
between
the
guns
and
philip
with
his
new
acquaintance
went
aft
and
seating
themselves
on
a
hencoop
the
priest
commenced
as
follows--
you
are
not
perhaps
aware
that
the
portuguese
although
anxious
to
secure
for
themselves
a
country
discovered
by
their
enterprise
and
courage
and
the
possession
of
which
i
fear
has
cost
them
many
crimes
have
still
never
lost
sight
of
one
point
dear
to
all
good
catholics--
that
of
spreading
wide
the
true
faith
and
planting
the
banner
of
christ
in
the
regions
of
idolatry
some
of
our
countrymen
having
been
wrecked
on
the
coast
we
were
made
acquainted
with
the
islands
of
japan
and
seven
years
afterwards
our
holy
and
blessed
st
francis
now
with
god
landed
on
the
island
of
ximo
where
he
remained
for
two
years
and
five
months
during
which
he
preached
our
religion
and
made
many
converts
he
afterwards
embarked
for
china
his
original
destination
but
was
not
permitted
to
arrive
there
he
died
on
his
passage
and
thus
closed
his
pure
and
holy
life
after
his
death
notwithstanding
the
many
obstacles
thrown
in
our
way
by
the
priests
of
idolatry
and
the
persecutions
with
which
they
occasionally
visited
the
members
of
our
faith
the
converts
to
our
holy
religion
increased
greatly
in
the
japanese
islands
the
religion
spread
fast
and
many
thousands
worshipped
the
true
god
after
a
time
the
dutch
formed
a
settlement
at
japan
and
when
they
found
that
the
japanese
christians
around
the
factories
would
deal
only
with
the
portuguese
in
whom
they
had
confidence
they
became
our
enemies
and
the
man
of
whom
we
have
spoken
and
who
at
that
period
was
the
head
of
the
dutch
factory
determined
in
his
lust
for
gold
to
make
the
christian
religion
a
source
of
suspicion
to
the
emperor
of
the
country
and
thus
to
ruin
the
portuguese
and
their
adherents
such
my
son
was
the
conduct
of
one
who
professed
to
have
embraced
the
reformed
religion
as
being
of
greater
purity
than
our
own
there
was
a
japanese
lord
of
great
wealth
and
influence
who
lived
near
us
and
who
with
two
of
his
sons
had
embraced
christianity
and
had
been
baptised
he
had
two
other
sons
who
lived
at
the
emperor's
court
this
lord
had
made
us
a
present
of
a
house
for
a
college
and
school
of
instruction
on
his
death
however
his
two
sons
at
court
who
were
idolaters
insisted
upon
our
quitting
this
property
we
refused
and
thus
afforded
the
dutch
principal
an
opportunity
of
inflaming
these
young
noblemen
against
us
by
this
means
he
persuaded
the
japanese
emperor
that
the
portuguese
and
christians
had
formed
a
conspiracy
against
his
life
and
throne
for
be
it
observed
that
when
a
dutchman
was
asked
if
he
was
a
christian
he
would
reply
no
i
am
a
hollander'
the
emperor
believing
in
this
conspiracy
gave
an
immediate
order
for
the
extirpation
of
the
portuguese
and
then
of
all
the
japanese
who
had
embraced
the
christian
faith
he
raised
an
army
for
this
purpose
and
gave
the
command
of
it
to
the
young
nobleman
i
have
mentioned
the
sons
of
the
lord
who
had
given
us
the
college
the
christians
aware
that
resistance
was
their
only
chance
flew
to
arms
and
chose
as
their
generals
the
other
two
sons
of
the
japanese
lord
who
with
their
father
had
embraced
christianity
thus
were
the
two
armies
commanded
by
four
brothers
two
on
the
one
side
and
two
on
the
other
the
christian
army
amounted
to
more
than
40000
men
but
of
this
the
emperor
was
not
aware
and
he
sent
a
force
of
about
25000
to
conquer
and
exterminate
them
the
armies
met
and
after
an
obstinate
combat
for
the
japanese
are
very
brave
the
victory
was
on
the
part
of
the
christians
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
who
saved
themselves
in
the
boats
the
army
of
the
emperor
was
cut
to
pieces
this
victory
was
the
occasion
of
making
more
converts
and
our
army
was
soon
increased
to
upwards
of
50000
men
on
the
other
hand
the
emperor
perceiving
that
his
troops
had
been
destroyed
ordered
new
levies
and
raised
a
force
of
150000
men
giving
directions
to
his
generals
to
give
no
quarter
to
the
christians
with
the
exception
of
the
two
young
lords
who
commanded
them
whom
he
wished
to
secure
alive
that
he
might
put
them
to
death
by
slow
torture
all
offers
of
accommodation
were
refused
and
the
emperor
took
the
field
in
person
the
armies
again
met
and
on
the
first
day's
battle
the
victory
was
on
the
part
of
the
christians
still
they
had
to
lament
the
loss
of
one
of
their
generals
who
was
wounded
and
taken
prisoner
and
no
quarter
having
been
given
their
loss
was
severe
the
second
day's
combat
was
fatal
to
the
christians
their
general
was
killed
they
were
overpowered
by
numbers
and
fell
to
a
man
the
emperor
then
attacked
the
camp
in
the
rear
and
put
to
the
sword
every
old
man
woman
and
child
on
the
field
of
battle
in
the
camp
and
by
subsequent
torture
more
than
60000
christians
perished
but
this
was
not
all
a
rigorous
search
for
christians
was
made
throughout
the
islands
for
many
years
and
they
were
when
found
put
to
death
by
the
most
cruel
torture
it
was
not
until
fifteen
years
ago
that
christianity
was
entirely
rooted
out
of
the
japanese
empire
and
during
a
persecution
of
somewhat
more
than
sixteen
years
it
is
supposed
that
upwards
of
400000
christians
were
destroyed
and
all
this
slaughter
my
son
was
occasioned
by
the
falsehood
and
avarice
of
that
man
who
met
his
just
punishment
but
a
few
days
ago
the
dutch
company
pleased
with
his
conduct
which
procured
for
them
such
advantages
continued
him
for
many
years
as
the
president
of
their
factory
in
japan
he
was
a
young
man
when
he
first
went
there
but
his
hair
was
grey
when
he
thought
of
returning
to
his
own
country
he
had
amassed
immense
wealth--immense
indeed
must
it
have
been
to
have
satisfied
avarice
such
as
his
all
has
now
perished
with
him
and
he
has
been
summoned
to
his
account
reflect
a
little
my
son
is
it
not
better
to
follow
up
our
path
of
duty
to
eschew
the
riches
and
pleasures
of
this
world
and
at
our
summons
hence
to
feel
that
we
have
hopes
of
bliss
hereafter
most
true
holy
father
replied
philip
musing
i
have
but
a
few
years
to
live
continued
the
old
man
and
god
knows
i
shall
quit
this
world
without
reluctance
and
so
could
i
replied
philip
you
my
son--no
you
are
young
and
should
be
full
of
hopes
you
have
still
to
do
your
duty
in
that
station
to
which
it
shall
please
god
to
call
you
i
know
that
i
have
a
duty
to
perform
replied
philip
father
the
night
air
is
too
keen
for
one
so
aged
as
you
retire
to
your
bed
and
leave
me
to
my
watch
and
my
own
thoughts
i
will
my
son
may
heaven
guard
you
take
an
old
man's
blessing
good
night
good
night
replied
philip
glad
to
be
alone
shall
i
confess
all
to
him
thought
philip
i
feel
i
could
confess
to
him--but
no
i
would
not
to
father
seysen--why
to
him
i
should
put
myself
in
his
power
and
he
might
order
me--no
no
my
secret
is
my
own
i
need
no
advisers
and
philip
pulled
out
the
relic
from
his
bosom
and
put
it
reverently
to
his
lips
the
batavia
waited
a
few
days
at
st
helena
and
then
continued
her
voyage
in
six
weeks
philip
again
found
himself
at
anchor
in
the
zuyder
zee
and
having
the
captain's
permission
he
immediately
set
off
for
his
own
home
taking
with
him
the
old
portuguese
priest
mathias
with
whom
he
had
formed
a
great
intimacy
and
to
whom
he
had
offered
his
protection
for
the
time
he
might
wish
to
remain
in
the
low
countries
far
be
it
from
me
to
wish
to
annoy
you
my
son
said
father
mathias
as
with
difficulty
he
kept
pace
with
the
rapid
strides
of
philip
who
was
now
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
his
home
but
still
recollect
that
this
is
but
a
transitory
world
and
that
much
time
has
elapsed
since
you
quitted
this
spot
for
that
reason
i
would
fain
desire
you
if
possible
to
check
these
bounding
aspirations
after
happiness
these
joyful
anticipations
in
which
you
have
indulged
since
we
quitted
the
vessel
i
hope
and
trust
in
the
mercy
of
god
that
all
will
be
right
and
that
in
a
few
minutes
you
will
be
in
the
arms
of
your
much-loved
wife
but
still
in
proportion
as
you
allow
your
hopes
to
be
raised
so
will
you
inevitably
have
them
crushed
should
disappointment
cross
your
path
at
flushing
we
were
told
that
there
has
been
a
dreadful
visitation
in
this
land
and
death
may
not
have
spared
even
one
so
young
and
fair
let
us
haste
on
father
replied
philip
what
you
say
is
true
and
suspense
becomes
most
dreadful
philip
increased
his
speed
leaving
the
old
man
to
follow
him
he
arrived
at
the
bridge
with
its
wooden
gate
it
was
then
about
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
for
they
had
crossed
the
scheldt
at
the
dawn
of
day
philip
observed
that
the
lower
shutters
were
still
closed
they
might
have
been
up
and
stirring
before
this
thought
he
as
he
put
his
hand
to
the
latch
of
the
door
it
was
not
fastened
philip
entered
there
was
a
light
burning
in
the
kitchen
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
beheld
a
maid-servant
leaning
back
in
her
chair
in
a
profound
sleep
before
he
had
time
to
go
in
and
awaken
her
he
heard
a
voice
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
saying
marie
is
that
the
doctor
philip
waited
no
longer
in
three
bounds
he
was
on
the
landing-place
above
and
pushing
by
the
person
who
had
spoken
he
opened
the
door
of
amine's
room
a
floating
wick
in
a
tumbler
of
oil
gave
but
a
faint
and
glimmering
light
the
curtains
of
the
bed
were
drawn
and
by
the
side
of
it
was
kneeling
a
figure
which
was
well
known
to
philip--that
of
father
seysen
philip
recoiled
the
blood
retreated
to
his
heart
he
could
not
speak
panting
for
breath
he
supported
himself
against
the
wall
and
at
last
vented
his
agony
of
feeling
by
a
deep
groan
which
aroused
the
priest
who
turned
his
head
and
perceiving
who
it
was
rose
from
his
knees
and
extended
his
hand
in
silence
she
is
dead
then
at
last
exclaimed
philip
no
my
son
not
dead
there
is
yet
hope
the
crisis
is
at
hand
in
one
more
hour
her
fate
will
be
decided
then
either
will
she
be
restored
to
your
arms
or
follow
the
many
hundreds
whom
this
fatal
epidemic
has
consigned
to
the
tomb
father
seysen
then
led
philip
to
the
side
of
the
bed
and
withdrew
the
curtain
amine
lay
insensible
but
breathing
heavily
her
eyes
were
closed
philip
seized
her
burning
hand
knelt
down
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
burst
into
a
paroxysm
of
tears
as
soon
as
he
had
become
somewhat
composed
father
seysen
persuaded
him
to
rise
and
sit
with
him
by
the
side
of
the
bed
this
is
a
melancholy
sight
to
witness
at
your
return
philip
said
he
and
to
you
who
are
so
ardent
so
impetuous
it
must
be
doubly
so
but
god's
will
be
done
remember
there
is
yet
hope--not
strong
hope
i
grant
but
still
there
is
hope
for
so
told
me
the
medical
man
who
has
attended
her
and
who
will
return
i
expect
in
a
few
minutes
her
disease
is
a
typhus
fever
which
has
swept
off
whole
families
within
these
last
two
months
and
still
rages
violently
fortunate
indeed
is
the
house
which
has
to
mourn
but
one
victim
i
would
that
you
had
not
arrived
just
now
for
it
is
a
disease
easily
communicated
many
have
fled
from
the
country
for
security
to
add
to
our
misfortunes
we
have
suffered
from
the
want
of
medical
advice
for
the
physician
and
the
patient
have
been
swept
away
together
the
door
was
now
slowly
opened
and
a
tall
dark
man
in
a
brown
cloak
holding
to
his
nose
a
sponge
saturated
with
vinegar
entered
the
room
he
bowed
his
head
to
philip
and
the
priest
and
then
went
to
the
bedside
for
a
minute
he
held
his
fingers
to
the
pulse
of
the
sufferer
then
laying
down
her
arm
he
put
his
hand
to
her
forehead
and
covered
her
up
with
the
bedclothes
he
handed
to
philip
the
sponge
and
vinegar
making
a
sign
that
he
should
use
it
and
beckoned
father
seysen
out
of
the
room
in
a
minute
the
priest
returned
i
have
received
his
directions
my
son
he
thinks
that
she
may
be
saved
the
clothes
must
be
kept
on
her
and
replaced
if
she
should
throw
them
off
but
everything
will
depend
upon
quiet
and
calm
after
she
recovers
her
senses
surely
we
can
promise
her
that
replied
philip
it
is
not
the
knowledge
of
your
return
or
even
the
sight
of
you
which
alarms
me
joy
seldom
kills
even
when
the
shock
is
great
but
there
are
other
causes
for
uneasiness
what
are
they
holy
father
philip
it
is
now
thirteen
days
that
amine
has
raved
and
during
that
period
i
have
seldom
quitted
her
but
to
perform
the
duties
of
my
office
to
others
who
required
it
i
have
been
afraid
to
leave
her
philip
for
in
her
ravings
she
has
told
such
a
tale
even
unconnected
as
it
has
been
as
has
thrilled
my
soul
with
horror
it
evidently
has
long
lain
heavily
on
her
mind
and
must
retard
her
recovery
philip
vanderdecken
you
may
remember
that
i
would
once
have
had
the
secret
from
you--the
secret
which
forced
your
mother
to
her
tomb
and
which
now
may
send
your
young
wife
to
follow
her
for
it
is
evident
that
she
knows
all
is
it
not
true
she
does
know
all
replied
philip
mournfully
and
she
has
in
her
delirium
told
all
nay
i
trust
she
has
told
more
than
all
but
of
that
we
will
not
speak
now
watch
her
philip
i
will
return
in
half
an
hour
for
by
that
time
the
doctor
tells
me
the
symptoms
will
decide
whether
she
will
return
to
reason
or
be
lost
to
you
for
ever
philip
whispered
to
the
priest
that
he
had
been
accompanied
by
father
mathias
who
was
to
remain
as
his
guest
and
requested
him
to
explain
the
circumstances
of
his
present
position
to
him
and
see
that
he
was
attended
to
father
seysen
then
quitted
the
room
when
philip
sat
down
by
the
bedside
and
drew
back
the
curtain
perhaps
there
is
no
situation
in
life
so
agonising
to
the
feelings
as
that
in
which
philip
was
now
placed
his
joyful
emotions
when
expecting
to
embrace
in
health
and
beauty
the
object
of
his
warmest
affections
and
of
his
continual
thought
during
his
long
absence
suddenly
checked
by
disappointment
anxiety
and
grief
at
finding
her
lying
emaciated
changed
corrupted
with
disease--her
mind
overthrown--
her
eyes
unconscious
of
his
presence--her
existence
hanging
by
a
single
hair--her
frame
prostrate
before
the
king
of
terrors
who
hovers
over
her
with
uplifted
dart
and
longs
for
the
fiat
which
should
permit
him
to
pierce
his
unconscious
victim
alas
thought
philip
is
it
thus
we
meet
amine
truly
did
father
mathias
advise
me
as
i
hurried
so
impetuously
along
not
as
i
fondly
thought
to
happiness
but
to
misery
god
of
heaven
be
merciful
and
forgive
me
if
i
have
loved
this
angelic
creature
of
thy
formation
even
more
than
i
have
thee
spare
her
good
heaven
spare
her--or
i
am
lost
for
ever
philip
covered
up
his
face
and
remained
for
some
time
in
prayer
he
then
bent
over
his
amine
and
impressed
a
kiss
upon
her
burning
lips
they
were
burning
hot
still
there
was
moisture
upon
them
and
philip
perceived
that
there
was
also
moisture
on
her
forehead
he
felt
her
hand
and
the
palm
of
it
was
moist
and
carefully
covering
her
with
the
bedclothes
he
watched
her
with
anxiety
and
hope
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
had
the
delight
of
perceiving
that
amine
was
in
a
profuse
perspiration
gradually
her
breathing
became
less
heavy
and
instead
of
the
passive
state
in
which
she
had
remained
she
moved
and
became
restless
philip
watched
and
replaced
the
clothes
as
she
threw
them
off
until
she
at
last
appeared
to
have
fallen
into
a
profound
and
sweet
sleep
shortly
after
father
seysen
and
the
physician
made
their
appearance
philip
stated
in
few
words
what
had
occurred
the
doctor
went
to
the
bedside
and
in
half
a
minute
returned
your
wife
is
spared
to
you
mynheer
but
it
is
not
advisable
that
she
should
see
you
so
unexpectedly
the
shock
may
be
too
great
in
her
weak
state
she
must
be
allowed
to
sleep
as
long
as
possible
on
her
waking
she
will
have
returned
to
reason
you
must
leave
her
then
to
father
seysen
may
i
not
remain
in
the
room
until
she
awakes
i
will
then
hasten
away
unobserved
that
will
be
useless
the
disease
is
contagious
and
you
have
been
here
too
long
already
remain
below
you
must
change
your
clothes
and
see
that
they
prepare
a
bed
for
her
in
another
room
to
which
she
must
be
transported
as
soon
as
you
think
she
can
bear
it
and
then
let
these
windows
be
thrown
open
that
the
room
may
be
properly
ventilated
it
will
not
do
to
have
a
wife
just
rescued
from
the
jaws
of
death
run
the
risk
of
falling
a
sacrifice
to
the
attentions
necessary
to
a
sick
husband
philip
perceived
the
prudence
of
this
advice
and
quitting
the
room
with
the
medical
man
he
went
and
changed
his
clothes
and
then
joined
father
mathias
whom
he
found
in
the
parlour
below
you
were
right
father
said
philip
throwing
himself
on
the
sofa
i
am
old
and
suspicious
you
are
young
and
buoyant
philip
but
i
trust
all
may
yet
be
well
i
trust
so
too
replied
philip
he
then
remained
silent
and
absorbed
in
thought
for
now
that
the
imminent
danger
was
over
he
was
reflecting
upon
what
father
seysen
had
communicated
to
him
relative
to
amine's
having
revealed
the
secret
whilst
in
a
state
of
mental
aberration
the
priest
perceiving
that
his
mind
was
occupied
did
not
interrupt
him
an
hour
had
thus
passed
when
father
seysen
entered
the
room
return
thanks
to
heaven
my
son
amine
has
awakened
and
is
perfectly
sensible
and
collected
there
is
now
little
doubt
of
her
recovery
she
has
taken
the
restorative
ordered
by
the
doctor
though
she
was
so
anxious
to
repose
once
more
that
she
could
hardly
be
persuaded
to
swallow
it
she
is
now
again
fast
asleep
and
watched
by
one
of
the
maidens
and
in
all
probability
will
not
move
for
many
hours
but
every
moment
of
such
sleep
is
precious
and
she
must
not
be
disturbed
i
will
now
see
to
some
refreshment
which
must
be
needful
to
us
all
philip
you
have
not
introduced
me
to
your
companion
who
i
perceive
is
of
my
own
calling
forgive
me
sir
replied
philip
you
will
have
great
pleasure
in
making
acquaintance
with
father
mathias
who
has
promised
to
reside
with
me
i
trust
for
some
time
i
will
leave
you
together
and
see
to
the
breakfast
being
prepared
for
the
delay
of
which
i
trust
father
mathias
will
accept
my
apology
philip
then
left
the
room
and
went
into
the
kitchen
having
ordered
what
was
requisite
to
be
taken
into
the
parlour
he
put
on
his
hat
and
walked
out
of
the
house
he
could
not
eat
his
mind
was
in
a
state
of
confusion
the
events
of
the
morning
had
been
too
harassing
and
exciting
and
he
felt
as
if
the
fresh
air
was
necessary
to
his
existence
as
he
proceeded
careless
in
which
direction
he
met
many
with
whom
he
had
been
acquainted
and
from
whom
he
had
received
condolence
at
his
supposed
bereavement
and
congratulations
when
they
learnt
from
him
that
the
danger
was
over
and
from
them
he
also
learnt
how
fatal
had
been
the
pestilence
not
one-third
of
the
inhabitants
of
terneuse
and
the
surrounding
country
remained
alive
and
those
who
had
recovered
were
in
a
state
of
exhaustion
which
prevented
them
from
returning
to
their
accustomed
occupations
they
had
combated
disease
but
remained
the
prey
of
misery
and
want
and
philip
mentally
vowed
that
he
would
appropriate
all
his
savings
to
the
relief
of
those
around
him
it
was
not
until
more
than
two
hours
had
passed
away
that
philip
returned
to
the
cottage
on
his
arrival
he
found
that
amine
still
slumbered
and
the
two
priests
were
in
conversation
below
my
son
said
father
seysen
let
us
now
have
a
little
explanation
i
have
had
a
long
conference
with
this
good
father
who
hath
much
interested
me
with
his
account
of
the
extension
of
our
holy
religion
among
the
pagans
he
hath
communicated
to
me
much
to
rejoice
at
and
much
to
grieve
for
but
among
other
questions
put
to
him
i
have
in
consequence
of
what
i
have
learnt
during
the
mental
alienation
of
your
wife
interrogated
him
upon
the
point
of
a
supernatural
appearance
of
a
vessel
in
the
eastern
seas
you
observe
philip
that
your
secret
is
known
to
me
or
i
could
not
have
put
that
question
to
my
surprise
he
hath
stated
a
visitation
of
the
kind
to
which
he
was
eye-witness
and
which
cannot
reasonably
be
accounted
for
except
by
supernatural
interposition
a
strange
and
certainly
most
awful
visitation
philip
would
it
not
be
better
instead
of
leaving
me
in
a
maze
of
doubt
that
you
now
confided
to
us
both
all
the
facts
connected
with
this
strange
history
so
that
we
may
ponder
on
them
and
give
you
the
benefit
of
advice
of
those
who
are
older
than
yourself
and
who
by
their
calling
may
be
able
to
decide
more
correctly
whether
this
supernatural
power
has
been
exercised
by
a
good
or
evil
intelligence
the
holy
father
speaks
well
philip
vanderdecken
observed
mathias
if
it
be
the
work
of
the
almighty
to
whom
should
you
confide
and
by
whom
should
you
be
guided
but
by
those
who
do
his
service
on
this
earth
if
of
the
evil
one
to
whom
but
to
those
whose
duty
and
wish
it
is
to
counteract
his
baneful
influence
and
reflect
philip
that
this
secret
may
sit
heavily
on
the
mind
of
your
cherished
wife
and
may
bow
her
to
the
grave
as
it
did
your
i
trust
sainted
mother
with
you
and
supported
by
your
presence
she
may
bear
it
well
but
recollect
how
many
are
the
lonely
days
and
nights
that
she
must
pass
during
your
absence
and
how
much
she
must
require
the
consolation
and
help
of
others
a
secret
like
this
must
be
as
a
gnawing
worm
and
strong
as
she
may
be
in
courage
must
shorten
her
existence
but
for
the
support
and
the
balm
she
may
receive
from
the
ministers
of
our
faith
it
was
cruel
and
selfish
of
you
philip
to
leave
her
a
lone
woman
to
bear
up
against
your
absence
and
at
the
same
time
oppressed
with
so
fatal
a
knowledge
you
have
convinced
me
holy
father
replied
philip
i
feel
that
i
should
before
this
have
made
you
acquainted
with
this
strange
history
i
will
now
state
the
whole
of
the
circumstances
which
have
occurred
but
with
little
hope
your
advice
can
help
me
in
a
case
so
difficult
and
in
a
duty
so
peremptory
yet
so
perplexing
philip
then
entered
into
a
minute
detail
of
all
that
had
passed
from
the
few
days
previous
to
his
mother's
death
until
the
present
time
and
when
he
had
concluded
he
observed--you
see
father
that
i
have
bound
myself
by
a
solemn
vow--that
that
vow
has
been
recorded
and
accepted
and
it
appears
to
me
that
i
have
nothing
now
to
do
but
to
follow
my
peculiar
destiny
my
son
you
have
told
us
strange
and
startling
things--things
not
of
this
world--if
you
are
not
deceived
leave
us
now
father
mathias
and
i
will
consult
upon
this
serious
matter
and
when
we
are
agreed
you
shall
know
our
decision
philip
went
upstairs
to
see
amine
she
was
still
in
a
deep
sleep
he
dismissed
the
servant
and
watched
by
the
bedside
for
nearly
two
hours
did
he
remain
there
when
he
was
summoned
down
to
meet
the
two
priests
we
have
had
a
long
conversation
my
son
said
father
seysen
upon
this
strange
and
perhaps
supernatural
occurrence
i
say
perhaps
for
i
would
have
rejected
the
frenzied
communications
of
your
mother
as
the
imaginings
of
a
heated
brain
and
for
the
same
reason
i
should
have
been
equally
inclined
to
suppose
that
the
high
state
of
excitement
that
you
were
in
at
the
time
of
her
death
may
have
disordered
your
intellect
but
as
father
mathias
positively
asserts
that
a
strange
if
not
supernatural
appearance
of
a
vessel
did
take
place
on
his
passage
home
and
which
appearance
tallies
with
and
corroborates
the
legend--if
so
i
may
call
it--to
which
you
have
given
evidence
i
say
that
it
is
not
impossible
but
that
it
is
supernatural
recollect
that
the
same
appearance
of
the
phantom
ship
has
been
permitted
to
me
and
to
many
others
replied
philip
yes
replied
father
seysen
but
who
is
there
alive
of
those
who
saw
it
but
yourself
but
that
is
of
little
importance
we
will
admit
that
the
whole
affair
is
not
the
work
of
man
but
of
a
superior
intelligence
superior
indeed
replied
philip
it
is
the
work
of
heaven
that
is
a
point
not
so
easily
admitted
there
is
another
power
as
well
as
that
which
is
divine--that
of
the
devil--the
arch-enemy
of
mankind
but
as
that
power
inferior
to
the
power
of
god
cannot
act
without
his
permission
we
may
indirectly
admit
that
it
is
the
will
of
heaven
that
such
sighs
and
portents
should
be
allowed
to
be
given
on
certain
occasions
then
our
opinions
are
the
same
good
father
nay
not
exactly
my
son
elymas
the
sorcerer
was
permitted
to
practise
his
arts--gained
from
the
devil--that
it
might
be
proved
by
his
overthrow
and
blindness
how
inferior
was
his
master
to
the
divine
ruler
but
it
does
not
therefore
follow
that
sorcery
generally
was
permitted
in
this
instance
it
may
be
true
that
the
evil
one
has
been
permitted
to
exercise
his
power
over
the
captain
and
crew
of
that
ship
and
as
a
warning
against
such
heavy
offences
the
supernatural
appearance
of
the
vessel
may
be
permitted
so
far
we
are
justifiable
in
believing
but
the
great
questions
are
first
whether
it
be
your
father
who
is
thus
doomed
and
secondly
how
far
you
are
necessitated
to
follow
up
this
mad
pursuit
which
it
appears
to
me--although
it
may
end
in
your
destruction--cannot
possibly
be
the
means
of
rescuing
your
father
from
his
state
of
unhallowed
abeyance
do
you
understand
me
philip
i
certainly
understand
what
you
would
say
father
but--
answer
me
not
yet
it
is
the
opinion
of
this
holy
father
as
well
as
of
myself
that
allowing
the
facts
to
be
as
you
suppose
the
revelations
made
to
you
are
not
from
on
high
but
the
suggestions
of
the
devil
to
lead
you
into
danger
and
ultimately
to
death
for
if
it
were
your
task
as
you
suppose
why
did
not
the
vessel
appear
on
this
last
voyage
and
how
can
you
allowing
that
you
met
her
fifty
times
have
communication
with
that
or
with
those
which
are
but
phantoms
and
shadows
things
not
of
this
world
now
what
we
propose
is
that
you
should
spend
a
proportion
of
the
money
left
by
your
father
in
masses
for
the
repose
of
his
soul
which
your
mother
in
other
circumstances
would
certainly
have
done
and
that
having
so
done
you
should
remain
quietly
on
shore
until
some
new
sign
should
be
given
to
you
which
may
warrant
our
supposing
that
you
are
really
chosen
for
this
strange
pursuit
but
my
oath
father--my
recorded
vow
from
that
my
son
the
holy
church
hath
power
to
absolve
you
and
that
absolution
you
shall
receive
you
have
put
yourself
into
our
hands
and
by
our
decision
you
must
be
guided
if
there
be
wrong
it
is
we
and
not
you
who
are
responsible
but
at
present
let
us
say
no
more
i
will
now
go
up
and
so
soon
as
your
wife
awakens
prepare
her
for
your
meeting
when
father
seysen
had
quitted
the
room
father
mathias
debated
the
matter
with
philip
a
long
discussion
ensued
in
which
similar
arguments
were
made
use
of
by
the
priest
and
philip
although
not
convinced
was
at
least
doubtful
and
perplexed
he
left
the
cottage
a
new
sign--a
corroborative
sign
thought
philip
surely
there
have
been
signs
and
wonders
enough
still
it
may
be
true
that
masses
for
my
father's
soul
may
relieve
him
from
his
state
of
torture
at
all
events
if
they
decide
for
me
i
am
not
to
blame
well
then
let
us
wait
for
a
new
sign
of
the
divine
will--if
so
it
must
be
and
philip
walked
on
occasionally
thinking
on
the
arguments
of
father
seysen
and
oftener
thinking
of
amine
it
was
now
evening
and
the
sun
was
fast
descending
philip
wandered
on
until
at
last
he
arrived
at
the
very
spot
where
he
had
knelt
down
and
pronounced
his
solemn
vow
he
recognised
it
he
looked
at
the
distant
hills
the
sun
was
just
at
the
same
height
the
whole
scene
the
place
and
the
time
were
before
him
again
philip
knelt
down
took
the
relic
from
his
bosom
and
kissed
it
he
watched
the
sun--he
bowed
himself
to
the
earth
he
waited
for
a
sign
but
the
sun
sank
down
and
the
veil
of
night
spread
over
the
landscape
there
was
no
sign
and
philip
rose
and
walked
home
towards
the
cottage
more
inclined
than
before
to
follow
the
suggestions
of
father
seysen
on
his
return
philip
went
softly
up
stairs
and
entered
the
room
of
amine
whom
he
found
awake
and
in
conversation
with
the
priests
the
curtain
was
closed
and
he
was
not
perceived
with
a
beating
heart
he
remained
near
the
wall
at
the
head
of
the
bed
reason
to
believe
that
my
husband
has
arrived
said
amine
in
a
faint
voice
oh
tell
me
why
so
his
ship
is
arrived
we
know
and
one
who
had
seen
her
said
that
all
were
well
and
why
is
he
not
here
then
who
should
bring
the
news
of
his
return
but
himself
father
seysen
either
he
has
not
arrived
or
he
is
here--i
know
he
must
be
if
he
is
safe
and
well
i
know
my
philip
too
well
say
is
he
not
here
fear
not
if
you
say
yes
but
if
you
say
no
you
kill
me
he
is
here
amine
replied
father
seysen--here
and
well
o
god
i
thank
you
but
where
is
he
if
he
is
here
he
must
be
in
this
room
or
else
you
deceive
me
oh
this
suspense
is
death
i
am
here
cried
philip
opening
the
curtains
amine
rose
with
a
shriek
held
out
her
arms
and
then
fell
senseless
back
in
a
few
seconds
however
she
was
restored
and
proved
the
truth
of
the
good
father's
assertion
that
joy
does
not
kill
we
must
now
pass
over
the
few
days
during
which
philip
watched
the
couch
of
his
amine
who
rapidly
regained
her
strength
as
soon
as
she
was
well
enough
to
enter
upon
the
subject
philip
narrated
all
that
had
passed
since
his
departure
the
confession
which
he
had
made
to
father
seysen
and
the
result
amine
too
glad
that
philip
should
remain
with
her
added
her
persuasions
to
those
of
the
priests
and
for
some
little
time
philip
talked
no
more
of
going
to
sea
six
weeks
had
flown
away
and
amine
restored
to
health
wandered
over
the
country
hanging
on
the
arm
of
her
adored
philip
or
nestled
by
his
side
in
their
comfortable
home
father
mathias
still
remained
their
guest
the
masses
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
vanderdecken
had
been
paid
for
and
more
money
had
been
confided
to
the
care
of
father
seysen
to
relieve
the
sufferings
of
the
afflicted
poor
it
may
be
easily
supposed
that
one
of
the
chief
topics
of
conversation
between
philip
and
amine
was
the
decision
of
the
two
priests
relative
to
the
conduct
of
philip
he
had
been
absolved
from
his
oath
but
at
the
same
time
that
he
submitted
to
his
clerical
advisers
he
was
by
no
means
satisfied
his
love
for
amine
her
wishes
for
his
remaining
at
home
certainly
added
weight
to
the
fiat
of
father
seysen
but
although
he
in
consequence
obeyed
it
more
willingly
his
doubts
of
the
propriety
of
his
conduct
remained
the
same
the
arguments
of
amine
who
now
that
she
was
supported
by
the
opinion
of
the
priests
had
become
opposed
to
philip's
departure
even
her
caresses
with
which
those
arguments
were
mingled
were
effective
but
for
the
moment
no
sooner
was
philip
left
to
himself
no
sooner
was
the
question
for
a
time
dismissed
than
he
felt
an
inward
accusation
that
he
was
neglecting
a
sacred
duty
amine
perceived
how
often
the
cloud
was
upon
his
brow
she
knew
too
well
the
cause
and
constantly
did
she
recommence
her
arguments
and
caresses
until
philip
forgot
that
there
was
aught
but
amine
in
the
world
one
morning
as
they
were
seated
upon
a
green
bank
picking
the
flowers
that
blossomed
round
them
and
tossing
them
away
in
pure
listlessness
amine
took
the
opportunity
that
she
had
often
waited
for
to
enter
upon
a
subject
hitherto
unmentioned
philip
said
she
do
you
believe
in
dreams
think
you
that
we
may
have
supernatural
communications
by
such
means
of
course
we
may
replied
philip
we
have
proof
abundant
of
it
in
the
holy
writings
why
then
do
you
not
satisfy
your
scruples
by
a
dream
my
dearest
amine
dreams
come
unbidden
we
cannot
command
or
prevent
them
we
can
command
them
philip
say
that
you
would
dream
upon
the
subject
nearest
to
your
heart
and
you
shall
i
shall
yes
i
have
that
power
philip
although
i
have
not
spoken
of
it
i
had
it
from
my
mother
with
much
more
that
of
late
i
have
never
thought
of
you
know
philip
i
never
say
that
which
is
not
i
tell
you
that
if
you
choose
you
shall
dream
upon
it
and
to
what
good
amine
if
you
have
power
to
make
me
dream
that
power
must
be
from
somewhere
it
is
of
course
there
are
agencies
you
little
think
of
which
in
my
country
are
still
called
into
use
i
have
a
charm
philip
which
never
fails
a
charm
amine
do
you
then
deal
in
sorcery
for
such
powers
cannot
be
from
heaven
i
cannot
tell
i
only
know
the
power
is
given
it
must
be
from
the
devil
amine
and
why
so
philip
may
i
not
use
the
argument
of
your
own
priests
who
say
that
the
power
of
the
devil
is
only
permitted
to
be
used
by
divine
intelligence
and
that
it
cannot
used
without
that
permission'
allow
it
then
to
be
sorcery
or
what
you
please
unless
by
heaven
permitted
it
would
fail
but
i
cannot
see
why
we
should
suppose
that
it
is
from
an
evil
source
we
ask
for
a
warning
in
a
dream
to
guide
our
conduct
in
doubtful
circumstances
surely
the
evil
one
would
rather
lead
us
wrong
than
right
amine
we
may
be
warned
in
a
dream
as
the
patriarchs
were
of
old
but
to
use
mystic
or
unholy
charms
to
procure
a
vision
is
making
a
compact
with
the
devil
which
compact
the
evil
could
not
fulfil
if
not
permitted
by
a
higher
power
philip
your
reasoning
is
false
we
are
told
that
by
certain
means
duly
observed
we
may
procure
the
dreams
we
wish
our
observance
of
these
means
is
certainly
the
least
we
can
attend
to
to
prove
our
sincerity
forgive
me
philip
but
are
not
observances
as
necessary
in
your
religion--which
i
have
embraced
are
we
not
told
that
the
omission
of
the
mere
ceremony
of
water
to
the
infant
will
turn
all
future
chance
of
happiness
to
misery
eternal
philip
answered
not
for
some
time
i
am
afraid
amine
said
he
at
last
in
a
low
tone
i--
i
fear
nothing
philip
when
my
intentions
are
good
replied
amine
i
follow
certain
means
to
obtain
an
end
what
is
that
end
it
is
to
find
out
if
possible
what
may
be
the
will
of
heaven
in
this
perplexing
case
if
it
should
be
through
the
agency
of
the
devil
what
then
he
becomes
my
servant
and
not
my
master
he
is
permitted
by
heaven
to
act
against
himself
and
amine's
eyes
darted
fire
as
she
thus
boldly
expressed
herself
did
your
mother
often
exercise
her
art
inquired
philip
after
a
pause
not
to
my
knowledge
but
it
was
said
that
she
was
most
expert
she
died
young
as
you
know
or
i
should
have
known
much
more
think
you
philip
that
this
world
is
solely
peopled
by
such
dross
as
we
are--
things
of
clay--perishable
and
corruptible
lords
over
beasts--and
ourselves
but
little
better
have
you
not
from
your
own
sacred
writings
repeated
acknowledgments
and
proofs
of
higher
intelligences
mixing
up
with
mankind
and
acting
here
below
why
should
what
was
then
not
be
now
and
what
more
harm
is
there
to
apply
for
their
aid
now
than
a
few
thousand
years
ago
why
should
you
suppose
that
they
were
permitted
on
the
earth
then--and
not
permitted
now
what
has
become
of
them
have
they
perished
have
they
been
ordered
back--to
where--to
heaven
if
to
heaven--the
world
and
mankind
have
been
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
devil
and
his
agents
do
you
suppose
that
we
poor
mortals
have
been
thus
abandoned
i
tell
you
plainly
i
think
not
we
no
longer
have
the
communications
with
those
intelligences
that
we
once
had
because
as
we
become
more
enlightened
we
become
more
proud
and
seek
them
not
but
that
they
still
exist--a
host
of
good
against
a
host
of
evil
invisibly
opposing
each
other--is
my
conviction
but
tell
me
philip
do
you
in
your
conscience
believe
that
all
that
has
been
revealed
to
you
is
a
mere
dream
of
the
imagination
i
do
not
believe
so
amine
you
know
well
i
wish
i
could
then
is
my
reasoning
proved
for
if
such
communications
can
be
made
to
you
why
cannot
others
you
cannot
tell
by
what
agency
your
priests
say
it
is
that
of
the
evil
one
you
think
it
is
from
on
high
by
the
same
rule
who
is
to
decide
from
whence
the
dream
shall
come
'tis
true
amine
but
are
you
certain
of
your
power
certain
of
this
but
if
it
pleases
superior
intelligence
to
communicate
with
you
that
communication
may
be
relied
upon
either
you
will
not
dream
but
pass
away
the
hours
in
deep
sleep
or
what
you
dream
will
be
connected
with
the
question
at
issue
then
amine
i
have
made
my
mind
up--i
will
dream
for
at
present
my
mind
is
racked
by
contending
and
perplexing
doubts
i
would
know
whether
i
am
right
or
wrong
this
night
your
art
shall
be
employed
not
this
night
nor
yet
to-morrow
night
philip
think
you
one
moment
that
in
proposing
this
i
serve
you
against
my
own
wishes
i
feel
as
if
the
dream
will
decide
against
me
and
that
you
will
be
commanded
to
return
to
your
duty
for
i
tell
you
honestly
i
think
not
with
the
priests
but
i
am
your
wife
philip
and
it
is
my
duty
that
you
should
not
be
deceived
having
the
means
as
i
suppose
to
decide
your
conduct
i
offer
them
promise
me
that
if
i
do
this
you
will
grant
me
a
favour
which
i
shall
ask
as
my
reward
it
is
promised
amine
without
its
being
known
replied
philip
rising
from
the
turf
and
now
let
us
go
home
we
observed
that
philip
previous
to
his
sailing
in
the
batavia
had
invested
a
large
proportion
of
his
funds
in
dutch
east
india
stock
the
interest
of
the
money
was
more
than
sufficient
for
the
wants
of
amine
and
on
his
return
he
found
that
the
funds
left
in
her
charge
had
accumulated
after
paying
to
father
seysen
the
sums
for
the
masses
and
for
the
relief
of
the
poor
there
was
a
considerable
residue
and
philip
had
employed
this
in
the
purchase
of
more
shares
in
the
india
stock
the
subject
of
their
conversation
was
not
renewed
philip
was
rather
averse
to
amine
practising
those
mystical
arts
which
if
known
to
the
priests
would
have
obtained
for
her
in
all
probability
the
anathema
of
the
church
he
could
not
but
admire
the
boldness
and
power
of
amine's
reasonings
but
still
he
was
averse
to
reduce
them
into
practice
the
third
day
had
passed
away
and
no
more
had
been
said
upon
the
subject
philip
retired
to
bed
and
was
soon
fast
asleep
but
amine
slept
not
so
soon
as
she
was
convinced
that
philip
would
not
be
awakened
she
slipped
from
the
bed
and
dressed
herself
she
left
the
room
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
returned
bringing
in
her
hand
a
small
brazier
of
lighted
charcoal
and
two
small
pieces
of
parchment
rolled
up
and
fixed
by
a
knot
to
the
centre
of
a
narrow
fillet
they
exactly
resembled
the
philacteries
that
were
once
worn
by
the
jewish
nation
and
were
similarly
applied
one
of
them
she
gently
bound
upon
the
forehead
of
her
husband
and
the
other
upon
his
left
arm
she
threw
perfumes
into
the
brazier
and
as
the
form
of
her
husband
was
becoming
indistinct
from
the
smoke
which
filled
the
room
she
muttered
a
few
sentences
waved
over
him
a
small
sprig
of
some
shrub
which
she
held
in
her
white
hand
and
then
closing
the
curtains
and
removing
the
brazier
she
sat
down
by
the
side
of
the
bed
if
there
be
harm
thought
amine
at
least
the
deed
is
not
his--'tis
mine
they
cannot
say
that
he
has
practised
arts
that
are
unlawful
and
forbidden
by
his
priests
on
my
head
be
it
and
there
was
a
contemptuous
curl
on
amine's
beautiful
arched
lip
which
did
not
say
much
for
her
devotion
to
her
new
creed
morning
dawned
and
philip
still
slumbered
'tis
enough
said
amine
who
had
been
watching
the
rising
of
the
sun
as
she
beheld
his
upper
limb
a
pear
above
the
horizon
again
she
waved
her
arm
over
philip
holding
the
sprig
in
her
hand
and
cried
philip
awake
philip
started
up
opened
his
eyes
and
shut
them
again
to
avoid
the
glare
of
the
broad
daylight
rested
upon
his
elbow
and
appeared
to
be
collecting
his
thoughts
where
am
i
exclaimed
he
in
my
own
bed
yes
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
felt
the
scroll
what
is
this
continued
he
pulling
it
off
and
examining
it
and
amine
where
is
she
good
heavens
what
a
dream
another
cried
he
perceiving
the
scroll
tied
to
his
arm
i
see
it
now
amine
this
is
your
doing
and
philip
threw
himself
down
and
buried
his
face
in
the
pillow
amine
in
the
mean
time
had
slipped
into
bed
and
had
taken
her
place
by
philip's
side
sleep
philip
dear
sleep
said
she
putting
her
arms
round
him
we
will
talk
when
we
wake
again
are
you
there
amine
replied
philip
confused
i
thought
i
was
alone
i
have
dreamed
and
philip
again
was
fast
asleep
before
he
could
complete
his
sentence
amine
too
tired
with
watching
slumbered
and
was
happy
father
mathias
had
to
wait
a
long
while
for
his
breakfast
that
morning
it
was
not
till
two
hours
later
than
usual
that
philip
and
amine
made
their
appearance
welcome
my
children
said
he
you
are
late
we
are
father
replied
amine
for
philip
slept
and
i
watched
till
break
of
day
he
hath
not
been
ill
i
trust
replied
the
priest
no
not
ill
but
i
could
not
sleep
replied
amine
then
didst
thou
do
well
to
pass
the
night--as
i
doubt
not
thou
hast
done
my
child
in
holy
watchings
philip
shuddered
he
knew
that
the
watching
had
its
cause
been
known
would
have
been
in
the
priest's
opinion
anything
but
holy
amine
quickly
replied--
i
have
indeed
communed
with
higher
powers
as
far
as
my
poor
intellect
hath
been
able
the
blessing
of
our
holy
church
upon
thee
my
child
said
the
old
man
putting
his
hand
upon
her
head
and
on
thee
too
philip
philip
confused
sat
down
to
the
table
amine
was
collected
as
ever
she
spoke
little
it
is
true
and
appeared
to
commune
with
her
own
thoughts
as
soon
as
the
repast
was
finished
the
old
priest
took
up
his
breviary
and
amine
beckoning
to
philip
they
went
out
together
they
walked
in
silence
until
they
arrived
at
the
green
spot
where
amine
had
first
proposed
to
him
that
she
should
use
her
mystic
power
she
sat
sown
an
philip
fully
aware
of
her
purpose
took
his
seat
by
her
in
silence
philip
said
amine
taking
his
hand
and
looking
earnestly
in
his
face
last
night
you
dreamed
i
did
indeed
amine
replied
philip
gravely
tell
me
your
dream
for
it
will
be
for
me
to
expound
it
i
fear
it
needs
but
little
exposition
amine
all
i
would
know
is
from
what
intelligence
the
dream
has
been
received
tell
me
your
dream
replied
amine
calmly
i
thought
replied
philip
mournfully
that
i
was
sailing
as
captain
of
a
vessel
round
the
cape
the
sea
was
calm
and
the
breeze
light
i
was
abaft
the
sun
went
down
and
the
stars
were
more
than
usually
brilliant
the
weather
was
warm
and
i
lay
down
on
my
cloak
with
my
face
to
the
heavens
watching
the
gems
twinkling
in
the
sky
and
the
occasionally
falling
meteors
i
thought
that
i
fell
asleep
and
awoke
with
a
sensation
as
if
sinking
down
i
looked
around
me
the
masts
the
rigging
the
hull
of
the
vessel--all
had
disappeared
and
i
was
floating
by
myself
upon
a
large
beautifully-shaped
shell
on
the
wide
waste
of
waters
i
was
alarmed
and
afraid
to
move
lest
i
should
overturn
my
frail
bark
and
perish
at
last
i
perceived
the
fore-part
of
the
shell
pressed
down
as
if
a
weight
were
hanging
to
it
and
soon
afterwards
a
small
white
hand
which
grasped
it
i
remained
motionless
and
would
have
called
out
that
my
little
bark
would
sink
but
i
could
not
gradually
a
figure
raised
itself
from
the
waters
and
leaned
with
both
arms
over
the
fore-part
of
the
shell
where
i
first
had
seen
but
the
hand
it
was
a
female
in
form
beautiful
to
excess
the
skin
was
white
as
driven
snow
her
long
loose
hair
covered
her
and
the
ends
floated
in
the
water
her
arms
were
rounded
and
like
ivory
she
said
in
a
soft
sweet
voice--
philip
vanderdecken
what
do
you
fear
have
you
not
a
charmed
life'
i
know
not'
replied
i
whether
my
life
be
charmed
or
not
but
this
i
know
that
it
is
in
danger'
in
danger'
replied
she
it
might
have
been
in
danger
when
you
were
trusting
to
the
frail
works
of
men
which
the
waves
love
to
rend
to
fragments--your
good
ships
as
you
call
them
which
but
float
about
upon
sufferance
but
where
can
be
the
danger
when
in
a
mermaid's
shell
which
the
mountain
wave
respects
and
upon
which
the
cresting
surge
dare
not
throw
its
spray
philip
vanderdecken
you
have
come
to
seek
your
father'
i
have'
replied
i
is
it
not
the
will
of
heaven'
it
is
your
destiny--and
destiny
rules
all
above
and
below
shall
we
seek
him
together
this
shell
is
mine
you
know
not
how
to
navigate
it
shall
i
assist
you'
will
it
bear
us
both'
you
will
see'
replied
she
laughing
as
she
sank
down
from
the
fore-part
of
the
shell
and
immediately
afterwards
appeared
at
the
side
which
was
not
more
than
three
inches
above
the
water
to
my
alarm
she
raised
herself
up
and
sat
upon
the
edge
but
her
weight
appeared
to
have
no
effect
as
soon
as
she
was
seated
in
this
way--for
her
feet
still
remained
in
the
water--the
shell
moved
rapidly
along
and
each
moment
increased
its
speed
with
no
other
propelling
power
than
that
of
her
volition
do
you
fear
now
philip
vanderdecken'
no'
replied
i
she
passed
her
hands
across
her
forehead
threw
aside
the
tresses
which
had
partly
concealed
her
face
and
said--then
look
at
me'
i
looked
amine
and
i
beheld
you
me
observed
amine
with
a
smile
upon
her
lips
yes
amine
it
was
you
i
called
you
by
your
name
and
threw
my
arms
round
you
i
felt
that
i
could
remain
with
you
and
sail
about
the
world
for
ever
proceed
philip
said
amine
calmly
i
thought
we
ran
thousands
and
thousands
of
miles--we
passed
by
beautiful
islands
set
like
gems
on
the
ocean-bed
at
one
time
bounding
against
the
rippling
current
at
others
close
to
the
shore--skimming
on
the
murmuring
wave
which
rippled
on
the
sand
whilst
the
cocoa-tree
on
the
beach
waved
to
the
cooling
breeze
it
is
not
in
smooth
seas
that
your
father
must
be
sought'
said
she
we
must
try
elsewhere'
by
degrees
the
waves
rose
until
at
last
they
were
raging
in
their
fury
and
the
shell
was
tossed
by
the
tumultuous
waters
but
still
not
a
drop
entered
and
we
sailed
in
security
over
billows
which
would
have
swallowed
up
the
proudest
vessel
do
you
fear
now
philip'
said
you
to
me
no'
replied
i
with
you
amine
i
fear
nothing'
we
are
now
off
the
cape
again'
said
she
and
here
you
may
find
your
father
let
us
look
well
round
us
for
if
we
meet
a
ship
it
must
be
his
none
but
the
phantom
ship
could
swim
in
a
gale
like
this'
away
we
flew
over
the
mountainous
waves--skimming
from
crest
to
crest
between
them
our
little
bark
sometimes
wholly
out
of
the
water
now
east
now
west
north
south
in
every
quarter
of
the
compass
changing
our
course
each
minute
we
passed
over
hundreds
of
miles
at
last
we
saw
a
vessel
tossed
by
the
furious
gale
there'
cried
she
pointing
with
her
finger
there
is
your
father's
vessel
philip'
rapidly
did
we
approach--they
saw
us
from
on
board
and
brought
the
vessel
to
the
wind
we
were
alongside--the
gangway
was
clearing
away--
for
though
no
boat
could
have
boarded
our
shell
was
safe
i
looked
up
i
saw
my
father
amine
yes
saw
him
and
heard
him
as
he
gave
his
orders
i
pulled
the
relic
from
my
bosom
and
held
it
out
to
him
he
smiled
as
he
stood
on
the
gunnel
holding
on
by
the
main
shrouds
i
was
just
rising
to
mount
on
board
for
they
had
handed
to
me
the
man-ropes
when
there
was
a
loud
yell
and
a
man
jumped
from
the
gangway
into
the
shell
you
shrieked
slipped
from
the
side
and
disappeared
under
the
wave
and
in
a
moment
the
shell
guided
by
the
man
who
had
taken
your
place
flew
away
from
the
vessel
with
the
rapidity
of
thought
i
felt
a
deadly
chill
pervade
my
frame
i
turned
round
to
look
at
my
new
companion--it
was
the
pilot
schriften--the
one-eyed
wretch
who
was
drowned
when
we
were
wrecked
in
table
bay
no
no
not
yet'
cried
he
in
an
agony
of
despair
and
rage
i
hurled
him
off
his
seat
on
the
shell
and
he
floated
on
the
wild
waters
philip
vanderdecken'
said
he
as
he
swam
we
shall
meet
again'
i
turned
away
my
head
in
disgust
when
a
wave
filled
my
bark
and
down
it
sank
i
was
struggling
under
the
water
sinking
still
deeper
and
deeper
but
without
pain
when
i
awoke
now
amine
said
philip
after
a
pause
what
think
you
i
of
my
dream
does
it
not
point
out
that
i
am
your
friend
philip
and
that
the
pilot
schriften
is
your
enemy
i
grant
it
but
he
is
dead
is
that
so
certain
he
hardly
could
have
escaped
without
my
knowledge
that
is
true
but
the
dream
would
imply
otherwise
philip
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
only
way
in
which
this
dream
is
to
be
expounded
is--
that
you
remain
on
shore
for
the
present
the
advice
is
that
of
the
priests
in
either
case
you
require
some
further
intimation
in
your
dream
i
was
your
safe
guide--be
guided
now
by
me
again
be
it
so
amine
if
your
strange
art
be
in
opposition
to
our
holy
faith
you
expound
the
dream
in
conformity
with
the
advice
of
its
ministers
i
do
and
now
philip
let
us
dismiss
the
subject
from
our
thoughts
should
the
time
come
your
amine
will
not
persuade
you
from
your
duty
but
recollect
you
have
promised
to
grant
one
favour
when
i
ask
it
i
have
say
then
amine
what
may
be
your
wish
o
nothing
at
present
i
have
no
wish
on
earth
but
what
is
gratified
have
i
not
you
dear
philip
replied
amine
fondly
throwing
herself
on
her
husband's
shoulder
it
was
about
three
months
after
this
conversation
that
amine
and
philip
were
again
seated
upon
the
mossy
bank
which
we
have
mentioned
and
which
had
become
their
favourite
resort
father
mathias
had
contracted
a
great
intimacy
with
father
seysen
and
the
two
priests
were
almost
as
inseparable
as
were
philip
and
amine
having
determined
to
wait
a
summons
previous
to
philip's
again
entering
upon
his
strange
and
fearful
task
and
happy
in
the
possession
of
each
other
the
subject
was
seldom
revived
philip
who
had
on
his
return
expressed
his
wish
to
the
directors
of
the
company
for
immediate
employment
and
if
possible
to
have
the
command
of
a
vessel
had
since
that
period
taken
no
further
steps
nor
had
had
any
communication
with
amsterdam
i
am
fond
of
this
bank
philip
said
amine
i
appear
to
have
formed
an
intimacy
with
it
it
was
here
if
you
recollect
that
we
debated
the
subject
of
the
lawfulness
of
inducing
dreams
and
it
was
here
dear
philip
that
you
told
me
your
dream
and
that
i
expounded
it
you
did
so
amine
but
if
you
ask
the
opinion
of
father
seysen
you
will
find
that
he
would
give
rather
a
strong
decision
against
you--he
would
call
it
heretical
and
damnable
let
him
if
he
pleases
i
have
no
objection
to
tell
him
i
pray
not
amine
let
the
secret
remain
with
ourselves
only
think
you
father
mathias
would
blame
me
i
certainly
do
well
i
do
not
there
is
a
kindness
and
liberality
about
the
old
man
that
i
admire
i
should
like
to
argue
the
question
with
him
as
amine
spoke
philip
felt
something
touch
his
shoulder
and
a
sudden
chill
ran
through
his
frame
in
a
moment
his
ideas
reverted
to
the
probable
cause
he
turned
round
his
head
and
to
his
amazement
beheld
the
supposed
to
be
drowned
mate
of
the
ter
schilling
the
one-eyed
schriften
who
stood
behind
him
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
the
sudden
appearance
of
this
malignant
wretch
induced
philip
to
exclaim
merciful
heaven
is
it
possible
amine
who
had
turned
her
head
round
at
the
exclamation
of
philip
covered
up
her
face
and
burst
into
tears
it
was
not
i
fear
that
caused
this
unusual
emotion
on
her
part
but
the
conviction
that
her
husband
was
never
to
be
at
rest
but
in
the
grave
philip
vanderdecken
said
schriften
he
he
i've
a
letter
for
you--
it
is
from
the
company
philip
took
the
letter
but
previous
to
opening
it
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
schriften
i
thought
said
he
that
you
were
drowned
when
the
ship
was
wrecked
in
false
bay
how
did
you
escape
how
did
i
escape
replied
schriften
allow
me
to
ask
how
did
you
escape
i
was
thrown
up
by
the
waves
replied
philip
but--
but
interrupted
schriften
he
he
the
waves
ought
not
to
have
thrown
me
up
and
why
not
pray
i
did
not
say
that
no
but
i
presume
you
wish
it
had
been
so
but
on
the
contrary
i
escaped
in
the
same
way
that
you
did--i
was
thrown
up
by
the
waves--he
he
but
i
can't
wait
here
i
have
done
my
bidding
stop
replied
philip
answer
me
one
question
do
you
sail
in
the
same
vessel
with
me
this
time
i'd
rather
be
excused
replied
schriften
i
am
not
looking
for
the
phantom
ship
mynheer
vanderdecken
and
with
this
reply
the
little
man
turned
round
and
went
away
at
a
rapid
pace
is
not
this
a
summons
amine
said
philip
after
a
pause
still
holding
the
letter
in
his
hand
with
the
seal
unbroken
i
will
not
deny
it
dearest
philip
it
is
most
surely
so
the
hateful
messenger
appears
to
have
risen
from
the
grave
that
he
might
deliver
it
forgive
me
philip
but
i
was
taken
by
surprise
i
will
not
again
annoy
you
with
a
woman's
weakness
my
poor
amine
replied
philip
mournfully
alas
why
did
i
not
perform
my
pilgrimage
alone
it
was
selfish
of
me
to
link
you
with
so
much
wretchedness
and
join
you
with
me
in
bearing
the
fardel
of
never-ending
anxiety
and
suspense
and
who
should
bear
it
with
you
my
dearest
philip
if
it
is
not
the
wife
of
your
bosom
you
little
know
my
heart
if
you
think
i
shrink
from
the
duty
no
philip
it
is
a
pleasure
even
in
its
most
acute
pangs
for
i
consider
that
i
am
by
partaking
with
relieving
you
of
a
portion
of
your
sorrow
and
i
am
proud
that
i
am
the
wife
of
one
who
has
been
selected
to
be
so
peculiarly
tried
but
dearest
no
more
of
this
you
must
read
the
letter
philip
did
not
answer
he
broke
the
seal
and
found
that
the
letter
intimated
to
him
that
he
was
appointed
as
first
mate
to
the
vrow
katerina
a
vessel
which
sailed
with
the
next
fleet
and
requesting
he
would
join
as
quickly
as
possible
as
she
would
soon
be
ready
to
receive
her
cargo
the
letter
which
was
from
the
secretary
further
informed
him
that
after
this
voyage
he
might
be
certain
of
having
the
command
of
a
vessel
as
captain
upon
conditions
which
would
be
explained
when
he
called
upon
the
board
i
thought
philip
that
you
had
requested
the
command
of
a
vessel
for
this
voyage
observed
amine
mournfully
i
did
replied
philip
but
not
having
followed
up
my
application
it
appears
not
to
have
been
attended
to
it
has
been
my
own
fault
and
now
it
is
too
late
yes
dearest
most
assuredly
so
but
it
matters
not
i
would
as
willingly
perhaps
rather
sail
this
voyage
as
first
mate
philip
i
may
as
well
speak
now
that
i
am
disappointed
i
must
confess
i
fully
expected
that
you
would
have
had
the
command
of
a
vessel
and
you
may
remember
that
i
exacted
a
promise
from
you
on
this
very
bank
upon
which
we
now
sit
at
the
time
that
you
told
me
your
dream
that
promise
i
shall
still
exact
and
i
now
tell
you
what
i
had
intended
to
ask
it
was
my
dear
philip
permission
to
sail
with
you
with
you
i
care
for
nothing
i
can
be
happy
under
every
privation
or
danger
but
to
be
left
alone
for
so
long
brooding
over
my
painful
thoughts
devoured
by
suspense
impatient
restless
and
incapable
of
applying
to
any
one
thing--that
dear
philip
is
the
height
of
misery
and
that
is
what
i
feel
when
you
are
absent
recollect
i
have
your
promise
philip
as
captain
you
have
the
means
of
receiving
your
wife
on
board
i
am
bitterly
disappointed
in
being
left
this
time
do
therefore
to
a
certain
degree
console
me
by
promising
that
i
shall
sail
with
you
next
voyage
if
heaven
permit
your
return
i
promise
it
amine
since
you
are
so
earnest
i
can
refuse
you
nothing
but
i
have
a
foreboding
that
yours
and
my
happiness
will
be
wrecked
for
ever
i
am
not
a
visionary
but
it
does
appear
to
me
that
strangely
mixed
up
as
i
am
at
once
with
this
world
and
the
next
some
little
portion
of
futurity
is
opened
to
me
i
have
given
my
promise
amine
but
from
it
i
would
fain
be
released
and
if
ill
do
come
philip
it
is
our
destiny
who
can
avert
fate
amine
we
are
free
agents
and
to
a
certain
extent
are
permitted
to
direct
our
own
destinies
ay
so
would
father
seysen
fain
have
made
me
believe
but
what
he
said
in
support
of
his
assertion
was
to
me
incomprehensible
and
yet
he
said
that
it
was
a
part
of
the
catholic
faith
it
may
be
so--i
am
unable
to
understand
many
other
points
i
wish
your
faith
were
made
more
simple
as
yet
the
good
man--for
good
he
really
is--has
only
led
me
into
doubt
passing
through
doubt
you
will
arrive
at
conviction
amine
perhaps
so
replied
amine
but
it
appears
to
me
that
i
am
as
yet
but
on
the
outset
of
my
journey
but
come
philip
let
us
return
you
must
to
amsterdam
and
i
will
go
with
you
after
your
labours
of
the
day
at
least
until
you
sail
your
amine's
smiles
must
still
enliven
you
is
it
not
so
yes
dearest
i
would
have
proposed
it
i
wonder
much
how
schriften
could
come
here
i
did
not
see
his
body
it
is
certain
but
his
escape
is
to
me
miraculous
why
did
he
not
appear
when
saved
where
could
he
have
been
what
think
you
amine
what
i
have
long
thought
philip
he
is
a
ghoul
with
evil
eye
permitted
for
some
cause
to
walk
the
earth
in
human
form
and
is
certainly
in
some
way
connected
with
your
strange
destiny
if
it
requires
anything
to
convince
me
of
the
truth
of
all
that
has
passed
it
is
his
appearance--the
wretched
afrit
oh
that
i
had
my
mother's
powers--but
i
forget
it
displeases
you
philip
that
i
ever
talk
of
such
things
and
i
am
silent
philip
replied
not
and
absorbed
in
their
own
meditations
they
walked
back
in
silence
to
the
cottage
although
philip
had
made
up
his
own
mind
he
immediately
sent
the
portuguese
priest
to
summon
father
seysen
that
he
might
communicate
with
them
and
take
their
opinion
as
to
the
summons
he
had
received
having
entered
into
a
fresh
detail
of
the
supposed
death
of
schriften
and
his
reappearance
as
a
messenger
he
then
left
the
two
priests
to
consult
together
and
went
upstairs
to
amine
it
was
more
than
two
hours
before
philip
was
called
down
and
father
seysen
appeared
to
be
in
a
state
of
great
perplexity
my
son
said
he
we
are
much
perplexed
we
had
hoped
that
our
ideas
upon
this
strange
communication
were
correct
and
that
allowing
all
that
you
have
obtained
from
your
mother
and
have
seen
yourself
to
have
been
no
deception
still
that
it
was
the
work
of
the
evil
one
and
if
so
our
prayers
and
masses
would
have
destroyed
this
power
we
advised
you
to
wait
another
summons
and
you
have
received
it
the
letter
itself
is
of
course
nothing
but
the
reappearance
of
the
bearer
of
the
letter
is
the
question
to
be
considered
tell
me
philip
what
is
your
opinion
on
this
point
it
is
possible
he
might
have
been
saved--why
not
as
well
as
yourself
i
acknowledge
the
possibility
father
replied
philip
he
may
have
been
cast
on
shore
and
have
wandered
in
another
direction
it
is
possible
although
anything
but
probable
but
since
you
ask
me
my
opinion
i
must
say
candidly
that
i
consider
he
is
no
earthly
messenger--nay
i
am
sure
of
it
that
he
is
mysteriously
connected
with
my
destiny
is
certain
but
who
he
is
and
what
he
is
of
course
i
cannot
tell
then
my
son
we
have
come
to
the
determination
in
this
instance
not
to
advise
you
must
act
now
upon
your
own
responsibility
and
your
own
judgment
in
what
way
soever
you
may
decide
we
shall
not
blame
you
our
prayers
shall
be
that
heaven
may
still
have
you
in
its
holy
keeping
my
decision
holy
father
is
to
obey
the
summons
be
it
so
my
son
something
may
occur
which
may
assist
to
work
out
the
mystery--a
mystery
which
i
acknowledge
to
be
beyond
my
comprehension
and
of
too
painful
a
nature
for
me
to
dwell
upon
philip
said
no
more
for
he
perceived
that
the
priest
was
not
at
all
inclined
to
converse
father
mathias
took
this
opportunity
of
thanking
philip
for
his
hospitality
and
kindness
and
stated
his
intention
of
returning
to
lisbon
by
the
first
opportunity
that
might
offer
in
a
few
days
amine
and
philip
took
leave
of
the
priests
and
quitted
for
amsterdam--father
seysen
taking
charge
of
the
cottage
until
amine's
return
on
his
arrival
philip
called
upon
the
directors
of
the
company
who
promised
him
a
ship
on
his
return
from
the
voyage
he
was
about
to
enter
upon
making
a
condition
that
he
should
become
part
owner
of
the
vessel
to
this
philip
consented
and
then
went
down
to
visit
the
vrow
katerina
the
ship
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
as
first
mate
she
was
still
unrigged
and
the
fleet
was
not
expected
to
sail
for
two
months
only
part
of
the
crew
were
on
board
and
the
captain
who
lived
in
dort
had
not
yet
arrived
so
far
as
philip
could
judge
the
vrow
katerina
was
a
very
inferior
vessel
she
was
larger
than
many
of
the
others
but
old
and
badly
constructed
nevertheless
as
she
had
been
several
voyages
to
the
indies
and
had
returned
in
safety
it
was
to
be
presumed
that
she
could
not
have
been
taken
up
by
the
company
if
they
had
not
been
satisfied
as
to
her
seaworthiness
having
given
a
few
directions
to
the
men
who
were
on
board
philip
returned
to
the
hostelrie
where
he
had
secured
apartments
for
himself
and
amine
the
next
day
as
philip
was
superintending
the
fitting
of
the
rigging
the
captain
of
the
vrow
katerina
arrived
and
stepping
on
board
of
her
by
the
plank
which
communicated
with
the
quay
the
first
thing
that
he
did
was
to
run
to
the
mainmast
and
embrace
it
with
both
arms
although
there
was
no
small
portion
of
tallow
on
it
to
smear
the
cloth
of
his
coat
oh
my
dear
vrow
my
katerina
cried
he
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
a
female
how
do
you
do
i'm
glad
to
see
you
again--you
have
been
quite
well
i
hope
you
do
not
like
being
laid
up
in
this
way
never
mind
my
dear
creature
you
shall
soon
be
handsome
again
the
name
of
this
personage
who
thus
made
love
to
his
vessel
was
wilhelm
barentz
he
was
a
young
man
apparently
not
thirty
years
of
age
of
diminutive
stature
and
delicate
proportions
his
face
was
handsome
but
womanish
his
movements
were
rapid
and
restless
and
there
was
that
appearance
in
his
eye
which
would
have
warranted
the
supposition
that
he
was
a
little
flighty
even
if
his
conduct
had
not
fully
proved
the
fact
no
sooner
were
the
ecstasies
of
the
captain
over
than
philip
introduced
himself
to
him
and
informed
him
of
his
appointment
oh
you
are
the
first
mate
of
the
vrow
katerina
sir
you
are
a
very
fortunate
man
next
to
being
captain
of
her
first
mate
is
the
most
enviable
situation
in
the
world
certainly
not
on
account
of
her
beauty
observed
philip
she
may
have
many
other
good
qualities
not
on
account
of
her
beauty
why
sir
i
say
as
my
father
has
said
before
me
and
it
was
his
vrow
before
it
was
mine
that
she
is
the
handsomest
vessel
in
the
world
at
present
you
cannot
judge
and
besides
being
the
handsomest
vessel
she
has
every
good
quality
under
the
sun
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
sir
replied
philip
it
proves
that
one
should
never
judge
by
appearances
but
is
she
not
very
old
old
not
more
than
twenty-eight
years--just
in
her
prime
stop
my
dear
sir
till
you
see
her
dancing
on
the
waters
and
then
you
will
do
nothing
all
day
but
discourse
with
me
upon
her
excellence
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
we
shall
have
a
very
happy
time
together
provided
the
subject
be
not
exhausted
replied
philip
that
it
never
will
be
on
my
part
and
allow
me
to
observe
mr
vanderdecken
that
any
officer
who
finds
fault
with
the
vrow
katerina
quarrels
with
me
i
am
her
knight
and
i
have
already
fought
three
men
in
her
defence--i
trust
i
shall
not
have
to
fight
a
fourth
philip
smiled
he
thought
that
she
was
not
worth
fighting
for
but
he
acted
upon
the
suggestion
and
from
that
time
forward
he
never
ventured
to
express
an
opinion
against
the
beautiful
vrow
katerina
the
crew
were
soon
complete
the
vessel
rigged
her
sails
bent
and
she
was
anchored
in
the
stream
surrounded
by
the
other
ships
composing
the
fleet
about
to
be
despatched
the
cargo
was
then
received
on
board
and
as
soon
as
her
hold
was
full
there
came
to
philip's
great
vexation
an
order
to
receive
on
board
150
soldiers
and
other
passengers
many
of
whom
were
accompanied
by
their
wives
and
families
philip
worked
hard
for
the
captain
did
nothing
but
praise
the
vessel
and
at
last
they
had
embarked
everything
and
the
fleet
was
ready
to
sail
it
was
now
time
to
part
with
amine
who
had
remained
at
the
hostelrie
and
to
whom
philip
had
dedicated
every
spare
moment
that
he
could
obtain
the
fleet
was
expected
to
sail
in
two
days
and
it
was
decided
that
on
the
morrow
they
should
part
amine
was
cool
and
collected
she
felt
convinced
that
she
should
see
her
husband
again
and
with
that
feeling
she
embraced
him
as
they
separated
on
the
beach
and
he
stepped
into
the
boat
in
which
he
was
to
be
pulled
on
board
yes
thought
amine
as
she
watched
the
form
of
her
husband
as
the
distance
between
them
increased--yes
i
know
that
we
shall
meet
again
it
is
not
this
voyage
which
is
to
be
fatal
to
you
or
me
but
i
have
a
dark
foreboding
that
the
next
in
which
i
shall
join
you
will
separate
us
for
ever--in
which
way
i
know
not--but
it
is
destined
the
priests
talk
of
free
will
is
it
free-will
which
takes
him
away
from
me
would
he
not
rather
remain
on
shore
with
me
yes
but
he
is
not
permitted
for
he
must
fulfil
his
destiny
free-will
why
if
it
were
not
destiny
it
were
tyranny
i
feel
and
have
felt
as
if
these
priests
are
my
enemies
but
why
i
know
not
they
are
both
good
men
and
the
creed
they
teach
is
good
goodwill
and
charity
love
to
all
forgiveness
of
injuries
not
judging
others
all
this
is
good
and
yet
my
heart
whispers
to
me
that--but
the
boat
is
alongside
and
philip
is
climbing
up
the
vessel
farewell
farewell
my
dearest
husband
i
would
i
were
a
man
no
no
'tis
better
as
it
is
amine
watched
till
she
could
no
longer
perceive
philip
and
then
walked
slowly
to
the
hostelrie
the
next
day
when
she
arose
she
found
that
the
fleet
had
sailed
at
daylight
and
the
channel
which
had
been
so
crowded
with
vessels
was
now
untenanted
he
is
gone
muttered
amine
now
for
many
months
of
patient
calm
enduring--i
cannot
say
of
living
for
i
exist
but
in
his
presence
we
must
leave
amine
to
her
solitude
and
follow
the
fortunes
of
philip
the
fleet
had
sailed
with
a
flowing
sheet
and
bore
gallantly
down
the
zuyder
zee
but
they
had
not
been
under
way
an
hour
before
the
vrow
katerina
was
left
a
mile
or
two
astern
mynheer
barentz
found
fault
with
the
setting
and
trimming
of
the
sails
and
with
the
man
at
the
helm
who
was
repeatedly
changed
in
short
with
everything
but
his
dear
vrow
katerina
but
all
would
not
do
she
still
dropped
astern
and
proved
to
be
the
worst-sailing
vessel
in
the
fleet
mynheer
vanderdecken
said
he
at
last
the
vrow
as
my
father
used
to
say
is
not
so
very
fast
before
the
wind
vessels
that
are
good
on
a
wind
seldom
are
but
this
i
will
say
that
in
every
other
point
of
sailing
there
is
no
other
vessel
in
the
fleet
equal
to
the
vrow
katerina
besides
observed
philip
who
perceived
how
anxious
how
captain
was
on
the
subject
we
are
heavily
laden
and
have
so
many
troops
on
deck
the
fleet
cleared
the
sands
and
were
then
close-hauled
when
the
vrow
katerina
proved
to
sail
even
more
slowly
than
before
when
we
are
so
very
close-hauled
observed
mynheer
barentz
the
vrow
does
not
do
so
well
but
a
point
free
and
then
you
will
see
how
she
will
show
her
stern
to
the
whole
fleet
she
is
a
fine
vessel
mynheer
vanderdecken
is
she
not
a
very
fine
roomy
vessel
replied
philip
which
was
all
that
in
conscience
he
could
say
the
fleet
sailed
on
sometimes
on
a
wind
sometimes
free
but
let
the
point
of
sailing
be
what
it
might
the
vrow
katerina
was
invariably
astern
and
the
fleet
had
to
heave-to
at
sunset
to
enable
her
to
keep
company
still
the
captain
continued
to
declare
that
the
point
of
sailing
on
which
they
happened
to
be
was
the
only
point
in
which
the
vrow
katerina
was
deficient
unfortunately
the
vessel
had
other
points
quite
as
bad
as
her
sailing
she
was
crank
leaky
and
did
not
answer
the
helm
well
but
mynheer
barentz
was
not
to
be
convinced
he
adored
his
ship
and
like
all
men
desperately
in
love
he
could
see
no
fault
in
his
mistress
but
others
were
not
so
blind
and
the
admiral
finding
the
voyage
so
much
delayed
by
the
bad
sailing
of
one
vessel
determined
to
leave
her
to
find
her
way
by
herself
so
soon
as
they
had
passed
the
cape
he
was
however
spared
the
cruelty
of
deserting
her
for
a
heavy
gale
came
on
which
dispersed
the
whole
fleet
and
on
the
second
day
the
good
ship
vrow
katerina
found
herself
alone
labouring
heavily
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
leaking
so
much
as
to
require
hands
constantly
at
the
pumps
and
drifting
before
the
gale
as
fast
to
leeward
almost
as
she
usually
sailed
for
a
week
the
gale
continued
and
each
day
did
her
situation
become
more
alarming
crowded
with
troops
encumbered
with
heavy
stores
she
groaned
and
laboured
while
whole
seas
washed
over
her
and
the
men
could
hardly
stand
at
the
pumps
philip
was
active
and
exerted
himself
to
the
utmost
encouraging
the
worn-out
men
securing
where
aught
had
given
way
and
little
interfered
with
by
the
captain
who
was
himself
no
sailor
well
observed
the
captain
to
philip
as
they
held
on
by
the
belaying-pins
you'll
acknowledge
that
she
is
a
fine
weatherly
vessel
in
a
gale--is
she
not
softly
my
beauty
softly
continued
he
speaking
to
the
vessel
as
she
plunged
heavily
into
the
waves
and
every
timber
groaned
softly
my
dear
softly
how
those
poor
devils
in
the
other
ships
must
be
knocking
about
now
heh
mynheer
vanderdecken
we
have
the
start
of
them
this
time
they
must
be
a
terrible
long
way
down
to
leeward
don't
you
think
so
i
really
cannot
pretend
to
say
replied
philip
smiling
why
there's
not
one
of
them
in
sight
yes
by
heavens
there
is
look
on
our
lee-beam
i
see
one
now
well
she
must
be
a
capital
sailer
at
all
events
look
there
a
point
abaft
the
beam
mercy
on
me
how
stiff
she
must
be
to
carry
such
a
press
of
canvass
philip
had
already
seen
her
it
was
a
large
ship
on
a
wind
and
on
the
same
tack
as
they
were
in
a
gale
in
which
no
vessel
could
carry
the
topsails
the
vrow
katerina
being
under
close-reefed
foresails
and
staysails
the
ship
seen
to
leeward
was
standing
under
a
press
of
sail--
topgallant-sail
royals
flying
jib
and
every
stitch
of
canvass
which
could
be
set
in
a
light
breeze
the
waves
were
running
mountains
high
bearing
each
minute
the
vrow
katerina
down
to
the
gunwale
and
the
ship
seen
appeared
not
to
be
affected
by
the
tumultuous
waters
but
sailed
steadily
and
smoothly
on
an
even
keel
at
once
philip
knew
it
must
be
the
phantom
ship
in
which
his
father's
doom
was
being
fulfilled
very
odd
is
it
not
observed
mynheer
barentz
philip
felt
such
an
oppression
on
his
chest
that
he
could
not
reply
as
he
held
on
with
one
hand
he
covered
up
his
eyes
with
the
other
but
the
seamen
had
now
seen
the
vessel
and
the
legend
was
too
well
known
many
of
the
troops
had
climbed
on
deck
when
the
report
was
circulated
and
all
eyes
were
now
fixed
upon
the
supernatural
vessel
when
a
heavy
squall
burst
over
the
vrow
katerina
accompanied
with
peals
of
thunder
and
heavy
rain
rendering
it
so
thick
that
nothing
could
be
seen
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
cleared
away
and
when
they
looked
to
leeward
the
stranger
was
no
longer
in
sight
merciful
heaven
she
must
have
been
upset
and
has
gone
down
in
the
squall
said
mynheer
barentz
i
thought
as
much
carrying
such
a
press
of
sail
there
never
was
a
ship
that
could
carry
more
than
the
vrow
katerina
it
was
madness
on
the
part
of
the
captain
of
that
vessel
but
i
suppose
he
wished
to
keep
up
with
us
heh
mynheer
vanderdecken
philip
did
not
reply
to
these
remarks
which
fully
proved
the
madness
of
his
captain
he
felt
that
his
ship
was
doomed
and
when
he
thought
of
the
numbers
on
board
who
might
be
sacrificed
he
shuddered
after
a
pause
he
said--
mynheer
barentz
this
gale
is
likely
to
continue
and
the
best
ship
that
ever
was
built
cannot
in
my
opinion
stand
such
weather
i
should
advise
that
we
bear
up
and
run
back
to
table
bay
to
refit
depend
upon
it
we
shall
find
the
whole
fleet
there
before
us
never
fear
for
the
good
ship
vrow
katerina
replied
the
captain
see
what
weather
she
makes
of
it
cursed
bad
observed
one
of
the
seamen
for
the
seamen
had
gathered
near
to
philip
to
hear
what
his
advice
might
be
if
i
had
known
that
she
was
such
an
old
crazy
beast
i
never
would
have
trusted
myself
on
board
mynheer
vanderdecken
is
right
we
must
back
to
table
bay
ere
worse
befall
us
that
ship
to
leeward
has
given
us
warning--she
is
not
seen
for
nothing--ask
mr
vanderdecken
captain
he
knows
that
well
for
he
is
a
sailor
this
appeal
to
philip
made
him
start
it
was
however
made
without
any
knowledge
of
philip's
interest
in
the
phantom
ship
i
must
say
replied
philip
that
whenever
i
have
fallen
in
with
that
vessel
mischief
has
ever
followed
vessel
why
what
was
there
in
that
vessel
to
frighten
you
she
carried
too
much
sail
and
she
has
gone
down
she
never
goes
down
replied
one
of
the
seamen
no
no
exclaimed
many
voices
but
we
shall
if
we
do
not
run
back
pooh
nonsense
mynheer
vanderdecken
what
say
you
i
have
already
stated
my
opinion
replied
philip
who
was
anxious
if
possible
to
see
the
ship
once
more
in
port
that
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
bear
up
for
table
bay
and
captain
continued
the
old
seaman
who
had
just
spoken
we
are
all
determined
that
it
shall
be
so
whether
you
like
it
or
not
so
up
with
the
helm
my
hearty
and
mynheer
vanderdecken
will
trim
the
sails
why
what
is
this
cried
captain
barentz
a
mutiny
on
board
of
the
vrow
katerina
impossible
the
vrow
katerina
the
best
ship
the
fastest
in
the
whole
fleet
the
dullest
old
rotten
tub
cried
one
of
the
seamen
what
cried
the
captain
what
do
i
hear
mynheer
vanderdecken
confine
that
lying
rascal
for
mutiny
pooh
nonsense
he's
mad
replied
the
old
seaman
never
mind
him
come
mynheer
vanderdecken
we
will
obey
you
but
the
helm
must
be
up
immediately
the
captain
stormed
but
philip
by
acknowledging
the
superiority
of
his
vessel
at
the
same
time
that
he
blamed
the
seamen
for
their
panic
pointed
out
to
him
the
necessity
of
compliance
and
mynheer
barentz
at
last
consented
the
helm
was
put
up
the
sails
trimmed
and
the
vrow
katerina
rolled
heavily
before
the
gale
towards
the
evening
the
weather
moderated
and
the
sky
cleared
up
both
sea
and
wind
subsided
fast
the
leaking
decreased
and
philip
was
in
hopes
that
in
a
day
or
two
they
would
arrive
safely
in
the
bay
as
they
steered
their
course
so
did
the
wind
gradually
decrease
until
at
last
it
fell
calm
nothing
remained
of
the
tempest
but
a
long
heavy
swell
which
set
to
the
westward
and
before
which
the
vrow
katerina
was
gradually
drifting
this
was
respite
to
the
worn-out
seamen
and
also
to
the
troops
and
passengers
who
had
been
cooped
below
or
drenched
on
the
main-deck
the
upper
deck
was
crowded
mothers
basked
in
the
warm
sun
with
their
children
in
their
arms
the
rigging
was
filled
with
the
wet
clothes
which
were
hung
up
to
dry
on
every
part
of
the
shrouds
and
the
seamen
were
busily
employed
in
repairing
the
injuries
of
the
gale
by
their
reckoning
they
were
not
more
than
fifty
miles
from
table
bay
and
each
moment
they
expected
to
see
the
land
to
the
southward
of
it
all
was
again
mirth
and
every
one
on
board
except
philip
considered
that
danger
was
no
more
to
be
apprehended
the
second
mate
whose
name
was
krantz
was
an
active
good
seaman
and
a
great
favourite
with
philip
who
knew
that
he
could
trust
to
him
and
it
was
on
the
afternoon
of
this
day
that
he
and
philip
were
walking
together
on
the
deck
what
think
you
vanderdecken
of
that
strange
vessel
we
saw
i
have
seen
her
before
krantz
and--
and
what
whatever
vessel
i
have
been
in
when
i
have
seen
her
that
vessel
has
never
returned
into
port--others
tell
the
same
tale
is
she
then
the
ghost
of
a
vessel
i
am
told
so
and
there
are
various
stories
afloat
concerning
her
but
of
this
i
assure
you--that
i
am
fully
persuaded
that
some
accident
will
happen
before
we
reach
port
although
everything
at
this
moment
appears
so
calm
and
our
port
is
so
near
at
hand
you
are
superstitious
replied
krantz
and
yet
i
must
say
that
to
me
the
appearance
was
not
like
a
reality
no
vessel
could
carry
such
sail
in
the
gale
but
yet
there
are
madmen
afloat
who
will
sometimes
attempt
the
most
absurd
things
if
it
was
a
vessel
she
must
have
gone
down
for
when
it
cleared
up
she
was
not
to
be
seen
i
am
not
very
credulous
and
nothing
but
the
occurrence
of
the
consequences
which
you
anticipate
will
make
me
believe
that
there
was
anything
supernatural
in
the
affair
well
i
shall
not
be
sorry
if
the
event
proves
me
wrong
replied
philip
but
i
have
my
forebodings--we
are
not
in
port
yet
no
but
we
are
but
a
trifling
distance
from
it
and
there
is
every
prospect
of
a
continuance
of
fine
weather
there
is
no
saying
from
what
quarter
the
danger
may
come
replied
philip
we
have
other
things
to
fear
than
the
violence
of
the
gale
true
replied
krantz
but
nevertheless
don't
let
us
croak
notwithstanding
all
you
say
i
prophesy
that
in
two
days
at
the
farthest
we
are
safely
anchored
in
table
bay
the
conversation
here
dropped
and
philip
was
glad
to
be
left
alone
a
melancholy
had
seized
him--a
depression
of
spirits
even
greater
than
he
had
ever
felt
before
he
leant
over
the
gangway
and
watched
the
heaving
of
the
sea
merciful
heaven
ejaculated
he
be
pleased
to
spare
this
vessel
let
not
the
wail
of
women
the
shrieks
of
the
poor
children
now
embarked
be
heard
the
numerous
body
of
men
trusting
to
her
planks--let
not
them
be
sacrificed
for
my
father's
crimes
and
philip
mused
the
ways
of
heaven
are
indeed
mysterious
thought
he
why
should
others
suffer
because
my
father
has
sinned
and
yet
is
it
not
so
everywhere
how
many
thousands
fall
on
the
field
of
battle
in
a
war
occasioned
by
the
ambition
of
a
king
or
the
influence
of
a
woman
how
many
millions
have
been
destroyed
for
holding
a
different
creed
of
faith
he
works
in
his
own
way
leaving
us
to
wonder
and
to
doubt
the
sun
had
set
before
philip
had
quitted
the
gangway
and
gone
down
below
commending
himself
and
those
embarked
with
him
to
the
care
of
providence
he
at
last
fell
asleep
but
before
the
bell
was
struck
eight
times
to
announce
midnight
he
was
awakened
by
a
rude
shove
of
the
shoulder
and
perceived
krantz
who
had
the
first
watch
standing
by
him
by
the
heaven
above
us
vanderdecken
you
have
prophesied
right
up--
quick
the
ship's
on
fire
on
fire
exclaimed
vanderdecken
jumping
out
of
his
berth--where
the
main-hold
i
will
up
immediately
krantz
in
the
mean
time
keep
the
hatches
on
and
rig
the
pumps
in
less
than
a
minute
philip
was
on
deck
where
he
found
captain
barentz
who
had
also
been
informed
of
the
case
by
the
second
mate
in
a
few
words
all
was
explained
by
krantz
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
fire
proceeding
from
the
main-hold
and
on
removing
one
of
the
hatches
which
he
had
done
without
calling
for
any
assistance
from
a
knowledge
of
the
panic
it
would
create
he
found
that
the
hold
was
full
of
smoke
he
had
put
it
on
again
immediately
and
had
only
made
it
known
to
philip
and
the
captain
thanks
for
your
presence
of
mind
replied
philip
we
have
now
time
to
reflect
quietly
on
what
is
to
be
done
if
the
troops
and
the
poor
women
and
children
knew
their
danger
their
alarm
would
have
much
impeded
us
but
how
could
she
have
taken
fire
in
the
main-hold
i
never
heard
of
the
vrow
katerina
talking
fire
before
observed
the
captain
i
think
it
is
impossible
it
must
be
some
mistake--she
is--
i
now
recollect
that
we
have
in
our
cargo
several
cases
of
vitriol
in
bottles
interrupted
philip
in
the
gale
they
must
have
been
disturbed
and
broken
i
kept
them
above
all
in
case
of
accident
this
rolling
gunwale
under
for
so
long
a
time
must
have
occasioned
one
of
them
to
fetch
way
that's
it
depend
upon
it
observed
krantz
i
did
object
to
receive
them
stating
that
they
ought
to
go
out
in
some
vessel
which
was
not
so
encumbered
with
troops
so
that
they
might
remain
on
the
main-deck
but
they
replied
that
the
invoices
were
made
out
and
could
not
be
altered
but
now
to
act
my
idea
is
to
keep
the
hatches
on
so
as
to
smother
it
if
possible
yes
replied
krantz
and
at
the
same
time
cut
a
hole
in
the
deck
just
large
enough
to
admit
the
hose
and
pump
as
much
water
as
we
can
down
into
the
hold
you
are
right
krantz
send
for
the
carpenter
and
set
him
to
work
i
will
turn
the
hands
up
and
speak
to
the
men
i
smell
the
fire
now
very
strong
there
is
no
time
to
lose
if
we
can
only
keep
the
troops
and
the
women
quiet
we
may
do
something
the
hands
were
turned
up
and
soon
made
their
appearance
on
deck
wondering
why
they
were
summoned
the
men
had
not
perceived
the
state
of
the
vessel
for
the
hatches
having
been
kept
on
the
little
smoke
that
issued
ascended
the
hatchway
and
did
not
fill
the
lower
deck
my
lads
said
philip
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
we
have
reason
to
suspect
that
there
is
some
danger
of
fire
in
the
main-hold
i
smell
it
cried
one
of
the
seamen
so
do
i
cried
several
others
with
every
show
of
alarm
and
moving
away
as
if
to
go
below
silence
and
remain
where
you
are
my
men
listen
to
what
i
say
if
you
frighten
the
troops
and
passengers
we
shall
do
nothing
we
must
trust
to
ourselves
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
mr
krantz
and
the
carpenter
are
doing
all
that
can
be
done
at
present
and
now
my
men
do
me
the
favour
to
sit
down
on
the
deck
every
one
of
you
while
i
tell
you
what
we
must
do
this
order
of
philip's
was
obeyed
and
the
effect
was
excellent
it
gave
the
men
time
to
compose
themselves
after
the
first
shock
for
perhaps
of
all
shocks
to
the
human
frame
there
is
none
which
creates
a
greater
panic
than
the
first
intimation
of
fire
on
board
of
a
vessel--a
situation
indeed
pitiable
when
it
is
considered
that
you
have
to
choose
between
the
two
elements
seeking
your
destruction
philip
did
not
speak
for
a
minute
or
two
he
then
pointed
out
to
the
men
the
danger
of
their
situation
what
were
the
measures
which
he
and
krantz
had
decided
upon
taking
and
how
necessary
it
was
that
all
should
be
cool
and
collected
he
also
reminded
them
that
they
had
but
little
powder
in
the
magazine
which
was
far
from
the
site
of
the
fire
and
could
easily
be
removed
and
thrown
overboard
and
that
if
the
fire
could
not
be
extinguished
they
had
a
quantity
of
spars
on
deck
to
form
a
raft
which
with
the
boats
would
receive
all
on
board
and
that
they
were
but
a
short
distance
from
land
philip's
address
had
the
most
beneficial
effects
the
men
rose
up
when
he
ordered
them
one
portion
went
down
to
the
magazine
and
handed
up
the
powder
which
was
passed
along
and
thrown
overboard
another
went
to
the
pumps
and
krantz
coming
up
reported
the
hole
to
have
been
cut
in
the
planking
of
the
deck
above
the
main-hold
the
hoses
were
fixed
and
a
quantity
of
water
soon
poured
down
but
it
was
impossible
that
the
danger
could
be
kept
secret
the
troops
were
sleeping
on
the
deck
and
the
very
employment
of
the
seamen
pointed
out
what
had
occurred
even
if
the
smoke
which
now
increased
very
much
and
filled
the
lower
deck
had
not
betrayed
it
in
a
few
minutes
the
alarm
of
fire
was
heard
throughout
the
vessel
and
men
women
and
children
were
seen
some
hurrying
on
their
clothes
some
running
frightened
about
the
decks
some
shrieking
some
praying
and
the
confusion
and
terror
were
hardly
to
be
described
the
judicious
conduct
of
philip
was
then
made
evident
had
the
sailors
been
awakened
by
the
appalling
cry
they
would
have
been
equally
incapable
of
acting
as
were
the
troops
and
passengers
all
subordination
would
have
ceased
some
would
have
seized
the
boats
and
left
the
majority
to
perish
others
would
have
hastened
to
the
spirit-room
and
by
their
drunkenness
added
to
the
confusion
and
horror
of
the
scene
nothing
would
have
been
effected
and
almost
all
would
in
all
probability
have
perished
miserably
but
this
had
been
prevented
by
the
presence
of
mind
shown
by
philip
and
the
second-mate
for
the
captain
was
a
cipher--not
wanting
in
courage
certainly
but
without
conduct
or
a
knowledge
of
his
profession
the
seamen
continued
steady
to
their
duty
pushing
the
soldiers
out
of
the
way
as
they
performed
their
allotted
tasks
and
philip
perceiving
this
went
down
below
leaving
krantz
in
charge
and
by
reasoning
with
the
most
collected
by
degrees
he
brought
the
majority
of
the
troops
to
a
state
of
comparative
coolness
the
powder
had
been
thrown
overboard
and
another
hole
having
been
cut
in
the
deck
on
the
other
side
the
other
pump
was
rigged
and
double
the
quantity
of
water
poured
into
the
hold
but
it
was
evident
to
philip
that
the
combustion
increased
the
smoke
and
steam
now
burst
through
the
interstices
of
the
hatchways
and
the
holes
cut
in
the
deck
with
a
violence
that
proved
the
extent
of
the
fire
which
raged
below
and
philip
thought
it
advisable
to
remove
all
the
women
and
children
to
the
poop
and
quarter-deck
of
the
ship
desiring
the
husbands
of
the
women
to
stay
with
them
it
was
a
melancholy
sight
and
the
tears
stood
in
philip's
eyes
as
he
looked
upon
the
group
of
females--some
weeping
and
straining
their
children
to
their
bosoms
some
more
quiet
and
more
collected
than
the
men
the
elder
children
mute
or
crying
because
their
mothers
cried
and
the
younger
ones
unconscious
of
danger
playing
with
the
first
object
which
attracted
their
attention
or
smiling
at
their
parents
the
officers
commanding
the
troops
were
two
ensigns
newly
entered
and
very
young
men
ignorant
of
their
duty
and
without
any
authority--for
men
in
cases
of
extreme
danger
will
not
obey
those
who
are
more
ignorant
than
themselves--and
at
philip's
request
they
remained
with
and
superintended
the
women
and
children
so
soon
as
philip
had
given
his
orders
that
the
women
and
children
should
be
properly
clothed
which
many
of
them
were
not
he
went
again
forward
to
superintend
the
labour
of
the
seamen
who
already
began
to
show
symptoms
of
fatigue
from
the
excess
of
their
exertions
but
many
of
the
soldiers
now
offered
to
work
at
the
pumps
and
their
services
were
willingly
accepted
their
efforts
were
in
vain
in
about
half
an
hour
more
the
hatches
were
blown
up
with
a
loud
noise
and
a
column
of
intense
and
searching
flame
darted
up
perpendicularly
from
the
hold
high
as
the
lower
mast-head
then
was
heard
the
loud
shriek
of
the
women
who
pressed
their
children
in
agony
to
their
breasts
as
the
seamen
and
soldiers
who
had
been
working
the
pumps
in
their
precipitate
retreat
from
the
scorching
flames
rushed
aft
and
fell
among
the
huddled
crowd
be
steady
my
lads--steady
my
good
fellows
exclaimed
philip
there
is
no
danger
yet
recollect
we
have
our
boats
and
raft
and
although
we
cannot
subdue
the
fire
and
save
the
vessel
still
we
may
if
you
are
cool
and
collected
not
only
save
ourselves
but
every
one--even
the
poor
infants
who
now
appeal
to
you
as
men
to
exert
yourselves
in
their
behalf
come
come
my
lads
let
us
do
our
duty--we
have
the
means
of
escape
in
our
power
if
we
lose
no
time
carpenter
get
your
axes
and
cut
away
the
boom-lashings
now
my
men
let
us
get
our
boats
out
and
make
a
raft
fur
these
poor
women
and
children
we
are
not
ten
miles
from
the
land
krantz
see
to
the
boats
with
the
starboard
watch
larboard
watch
with
me
to
launch
over
the
booms
gunners
take
any
of
the
cordage
you
can
ready
for
lashing
come
my
lads
there
is
no
want
of
light--we
can
work
without
lanterns
the
men
obeyed
as
philip
to
encourage
them
had
almost
jocularly
remarked
for
a
joke
is
often
well-timed
when
apparently
on
the
threshold
of
eternity
there
was
no
want
of
light
the
column
of
fire
now
ascended
above
the
main-top--licking
with
its
forky
tongue
the
top-mast
rigging--and
embracing
the
main-mast
in
its
folds
and
the
loud
roar
with
which
it
ascended
proved
the
violence
and
rapidity
of
the
combustion
below
and
how
little
time
there
was
to
be
lost
the
lower
and
main
decks
were
now
so
filled
with
smoke
that
no
one
could
remain
there
some
few
poor
fellows
sick
in
their
cots
had
long
been
smothered
for
they
had
been
forgotten
the
swell
had
much
subsided
and
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
the
smoke
which
rose
from
the
hatchways
ascended
straight
up
in
the
air
which
as
the
vessel
had
lost
all
steerage
way
was
fortunate
the
boats
were
soon
in
the
water
and
trusty
men
placed
in
them
the
spars
were
launched
over
arranged
by
the
men
in
the
boats
and
lashed
together
all
the
gratings
were
then
collected
and
firmly
fixed
upon
the
spars
for
the
people
to
sit
upon
and
philip's
heart
was
glad
at
the
prospect
which
he
now
had
of
saving
the
numbers
which
were
embarked
but
their
difficulties
were
not
surmounted--the
fire
now
had
communicated
to
the
main-deck
and
burst
out
of
the
port-holes
amid-ships--and
the
raft
which
had
been
forming
alongside
was
obliged
to
be
drifted
astern
where
it
was
more
exposed
to
the
swell
this
retarded
their
labour
and
in
the
mean
time
the
fire
was
making
rapid
progress
the
main-mast
which
had
long
been
burning
fell
over
the
side
with
the
lurching
of
the
vessel
and
the
flames
out
of
the
main-deck
ports
soon
showed
their
points
above
the
bulwarks
while
volumes
of
smoke
were
poured
in
upon
the
upper-deck
almost
suffocating
the
numbers
which
were
crowded
there
for
all
communication
with
the
fore-part
of
the
ship
had
been
for
some
time
cut
off
by
the
flames
and
every
one
had
retreated
aft
the
women
and
children
were
now
carried
on
to
the
poop
not
only
to
remove
them
farther
from
the
suffocating
smoke
but
that
they
might
be
lowered
down
to
the
raft
from
the
stern
it
was
about
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
when
all
was
ready
and
by
the
exertions
of
philip
and
the
seamen
notwithstanding
the
swell
the
women
and
children
were
safely
placed
on
the
raft
where
it
was
considered
that
they
would
be
less
in
the
way
as
the
men
could
relieve
each
other
in
pulling
when
they
were
tired
after
the
women
and
children
had
been
lowered
down
the
troops
were
next
ordered
to
descend
by
the
ladders
some
few
were
lost
in
the
attempt
falling
under
the
boat's
bottom
and
not
re-appearing
but
two-thirds
of
them
were
safely
put
on
the
berths
they
were
ordered
to
take
by
krantz
who
had
gone
down
to
superintend
this
important
arrangement
such
had
been
the
vigilance
of
philip
who
had
requested
captain
barentz
to
stand
over
the
spirit-room
hatch
with
pistols
until
the
smoke
on
the
main-deck
rendered
the
precaution
unnecessary
that
not
a
single
person
was
intoxicated
and
to
this
might
be
ascribed
the
order
and
regularity
which
had
prevailed
during
this
trying
scene
but
before
one-third
of
the
soldiers
had
descended
by
the
stern
ladder
the
fire
burst
out
of
the
stern
windows
with
a
violence
that
nothing
could
withstand
spouts
of
vivid
flame
extended
several
feet
from
the
vessel
roaring
with
the
force
of
a
blowpipe
at
the
same
time
the
flames
burst
through
all
the
after-ports
of
the
main-deck
and
those
remaining
on
board
found
themselves
encircled
with
fire
and
suffocated
with
smoke
and
heat
the
stern
ladders
were
consumed
in
a
minute
and
dropped
into
the
sea
the
boats
which
had
been
receiving
the
men
were
obliged
also
to
back
astern
from
the
intense
heat
of
the
flames
even
those
on
the
raft
shrieked
as
they
found
themselves
scorched
by
the
ignited
fragments
which
fell
on
them
as
they
were
enveloped
in
an
opaque
cloud
of
smoke
which
hid
from
them
those
who
still
remained
on
the
deck
of
the
vessel
philip
attempted
to
speak
to
those
on
board
but
he
was
not
heard
a
scene
of
confusion
took
place
which
ended
in
great
loss
of
life
the
only
object
appeared
to
be
who
should
first
escape
though
except
by
jumping
overboard
there
was
no
escape
had
they
waited
and
as
philip
would
have
pointed
out
to
them
have
one
by
one
thrown
themselves
into
the
sea
the
men
in
the
boats
were
fully
prepared
to
pick
them
up
or
had
they
climbed
out
to
the
end
of
the
latteen
mizen-yard
which
was
lowered
down
they
might
have
descended
safely
by
a
rope
but
the
scorching
of
the
flames
which
surrounded
them
and
the
suffocation
from
the
smoke
was
overpowering
and
most
of
the
soldiers
sprang
over
the
taffrail
at
once
or
as
nearly
so
as
possible
the
consequence
was
that
there
were
thirty
or
forty
in
the
water
at
the
same
time
and
the
scene
was
as
heart-rending
as
it
was
appalling
the
sailors
in
the
boats
dragging
them
in
as
fast
as
they
could--the
women
on
the
raft
throwing
to
them
loose
garments
to
haul
them
in
at
one
time
a
wife
shrieking
as
she
saw
her
husband
struggling
and
sinking
into
eternity
at
another
curses
and
execrations
from
the
swimmer
who
was
grappled
with
by
the
drowning
man
and
dragged
with
him
under
the
surface
of
eighty
men
who
were
left
of
the
troops
on
board
at
the
time
of
the
bursting
out
of
the
flames
from
the
stern
windows
but
twenty-five
were
saved
there
were
but
few
seamen
left
on
board
with
philip
the
major
part
having
been
employed
in
making
the
raft
or
manning
the
three
boats
those
who
were
on
board
remained
by
his
side
regulating
their
motions
by
his
after
allowing
full
time
for
the
soldiers
to
be
picked
up
philip
ordered
the
men
to
climb
out
to
the
end
of
the
latteen
yard
which
hung
on
the
taffrail
and
either
to
lower
themselves
down
on
the
raft
if
it
was
under
or
to
give
notice
to
the
boats
to
receive
them
the
raft
had
been
dropped
farther
astern
by
the
seamen
that
those
on
board
of
it
might
not
suffer
from
the
smoke
and
heat
and
the
sailors
one
after
another
lowered
themselves
down
and
were
received
by
the
boats
philip
desired
captain
barentz
to
go
before
him
but
the
captain
refused
he
was
too
much
choked
with
smoke
to
say
why
but
no
doubt
but
that
it
would
have
been
something
in
praise
of
the
vrow
katerina
philip
then
climbed
out
he
was
followed
by
the
captain
and
they
were
both
received
into
one
of
the
boats
the
rope
which
had
hitherto
held
the
raft
to
the
ship
was
now
cast
off
and
it
was
taken
in
by
the
boats
and
in
a
short
time
the
vrow
katerina
was
borne
to
leeward
of
them
and
philip
and
krantz
now
made
arrangements
for
the
better
disposal
of
the
people
the
sailors
were
almost
all
put
into
boats
that
they
might
relieve
one
another
in
pulling
the
remainder
were
placed
on
the
raft
along
with
the
soldiers
the
women
and
the
children
notwithstanding
that
the
boats
were
all
as
much
loaded
as
they
could
well
bear
the
numbers
on
the
raft
were
so
great
that
it
sunk
nearly
a
foot
under
water
when
the
swell
of
the
sea
poured
upon
it
but
stanchions
and
ropes
to
support
those
on
board
had
been
fixed
and
the
men
remained
at
the
sides
while
the
women
and
children
were
crowded
together
in
the
middle
as
soon
as
these
arrangements
were
made
the
boats
took
the
raft
in
tow
and
just
as
the
dawn
of
day
appeared
pulled
in
the
direction
of
the
land
the
vrow
katerina
was
by
this
time
one
volume
of
flame
she
had
drifted
about
half
a
mile
to
leeward
and
captain
barentz
who
was
watching
as
he
sat
in
the
boat
with
philip
exclaimed--well
there
goes
a
lovely
ship
a
ship
that
could
do
everything
but
speak--i'm
sure
that
not
a
ship
in
the
fleet
would
have
made
such
a
bonfire
as
she
has--does
she
not
burn
beautifully--nobly
my
poor
vrow
katerina
perfect
to
the
last
we
never
shall
see
such
a
ship
as
you
again
well
i'm
glad
my
father
did
not
live
to
see
this
sight
for
it
would
have
broken
his
heart
poor
man
philip
made
no
reply
he
felt
a
respect
even
for
captain
barentz's
misplaced
regard
for
the
vessel
they
made
but
little
way
for
the
swell
was
rather
against
them
and
the
raft
was
deep
in
the
water
the
day
dawned
and
the
appearance
of
the
weather
was
not
favourable
it
promised
a
return
of
the
gale
already
a
breeze
ruffled
the
surface
of
the
water
and
the
swell
appeared
to
increase
rather
than
go
down
the
sky
was
overcast
and
the
horizon
thick
philip
looked
out
for
the
land
but
could
not
perceive
it
for
there
was
a
haze
on
the
horizon
so
that
he
could
not
see
more
than
five
miles
he
felt
that
to
gain
the
shore
before
the
coming
night
was
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
so
many
individuals
of
whom
more
than
sixty
were
women
and
children
who
without
any
nourishment
were
sitting
on
a
frail
raft
immersed
in
the
water
no
land
in
sight--a
gale
coming
on
and
in
all
probability
a
heavy
sea
and
dark
night
the
chance
was
indeed
desperate
and
philip
was
miserable--most
miserable--when
he
reflected
that
so
many
innocent
beings
might
before
the
next
morning
be
consigned
to
a
watery
tomb--
and
why--yes
there
was
the
feeling--that
although
philip
could
reason
against--he
never
could
conquer
for
his
own
life
he
cared
nothing--even
the
idea
of
his
beloved
amine
was
nothing
in
the
balance
at
these
moments
the
only
point
which
sustained
him
was
the
knowledge
that
he
had
his
duty
to
perform
and
in
the
full
exercise
of
his
duty
he
recovered
himself
land
ahead
was
now
cried
out
by
krantz
who
was
in
the
headmost
boat
and
the
news
was
received
with
a
shout
of
joy
from
the
raft
and
the
boats
the
anticipation
and
the
hope
the
news
gave
was
like
manna
in
the
wilderness--and
the
poor
women
on
the
raft
drenched
sometimes
above
the
waist
by
the
swell
of
the
sea
clasped
the
children
in
their
arms
still
closer
and
cried--my
darling
you
shall
be
saved
philip
stood
upon
the
stern-sheets
to
survey
the
land
and
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
finding
that
it
was
not
five
miles
distant
and
a
ray
of
hope
warmed
his
heart
the
breeze
now
had
gradually
increased
and
rippled
the
water
the
quarter
from
which
the
wind
came
was
neither
favourable
nor
adverse
being
on
the
beam
had
they
had
sails
for
the
boats
it
would
have
been
otherwise
but
they
had
been
stowed
away
and
could
not
be
procured
the
sight
of
land
naturally
rejoiced
them
all
and
the
seamen
in
the
boat
cheered
and
double-banked
the
oars
to
increase
their
way
but
the
towing
of
a
large
raft
sunk
under
water
was
no
easy
task
and
they
could
not
with
all
their
exertions
advance
more
than
half
a
mile
an
hour
until
noon
they
continued
their
exertions
not
without
success
they
were
not
three
miles
from
the
land
but
as
the
sun
passed
the
meridian
a
change
took
place
the
breeze
blew
strong
the
swell
of
the
sea
rose
rapidly
and
the
raft
was
often
so
deeply
immersed
in
the
waves
as
to
alarm
them
for
the
safety
of
those
upon
her
their
way
was
proportionably
retarded
and
by
three
o'clock
they
had
not
gained
half
a
mile
from
where
they
had
been
at
noon
the
men
not
having
had
refreshment
of
any
kind
during
the
labour
and
excitement
of
so
many
hours
began
to
flag
in
their
exertions
the
wish
for
water
was
expressed
by
all--from
the
child
who
appealed
to
its
mother
to
the
seaman
who
strained
at
the
oar
philip
did
all
he
could
to
encourage
the
men
but
finding
themselves
so
near
to
the
land
and
so
overcome
with
fatigue
and
that
the
raft
in
tow
would
not
allow
them
to
approach
their
haven
they
murmured
and
talked
of
the
necessity
of
casting
loose
the
raft
and
looking
out
for
themselves
a
feeling
of
self
prevailed
and
they
were
mutinous
but
philip
expostulated
with
them
and
out
of
respect
for
him
they
continued
their
exertions
for
another
hour
when
a
circumstance
occurred
which
decided
the
question
upon
which
they
had
recommenced
a
debate
the
increased
swell
and
the
fresh
breeze
had
so
beat
about
and
tossed
the
raft
that
it
was
with
difficulty
for
some
time
that
its
occupants
could
hold
themselves
on
it
a
loud
shout
mingled
with
screams
attracted
the
attention
of
those
in
the
boats
and
philip
looking
back
perceived
that
the
lashings
of
the
raft
had
yielded
to
the
force
of
the
waves
and
that
it
had
separated
amidship
the
scene
was
agonising
husbands
were
separated
from
their
wives
and
children--each
floating
away
from
each
other--for
the
part
of
the
raft
which
was
still
towed
by
the
boats
had
already
left
the
other
far
astern
the
women
rose
up
and
screamed
and
held
up
their
children
some
more
frantic
dashed
into
the
water
between
them
and
attempted
to
gain
the
floating
wreck
upon
which
their
husbands
stood
and
sank
before
they
could
be
assisted
but
the
horror
increased--one
lashing
having
given
way
all
the
rest
soon
followed
and
before
the
boats
could
turn
and
give
assistance
the
sea
was
strewed
with
the
spars
which
composed
the
raft
with
men
women
and
children
clinging
to
them
loud
were
the
yells
of
despair
and
the
shrieks
of
the
women
as
they
embraced
their
offspring
and
in
attempting
to
save
them
were
lost
themselves
the
spars
of
the
raft
still
close
together
were
hurled
one
upon
the
other
by
the
swell
and
many
found
death
by
being
jammed
between
them
although
all
the
boats
hastened
to
their
assistance
there
was
so
much
difficulty
and
danger
in
forcing
them
between
the
spars
that
but
few
were
saved
and
even
those
few
were
more
than
the
boats
could
well
take
in
the
seamen
and
a
few
soldiers
were
picked
up
but
all
the
females
and
the
children
had
sunk
beneath
the
waves
the
effect
of
this
catastrophe
may
be
imagined
but
hardly
described
the
seamen
who
had
debated
as
to
casting
them
adrift
to
perish
wept
as
they
pulled
towards
the
shore
philip
was
overcome
he
covered
his
face
and
remained
for
some
time
without
giving
directions
and
heedless
of
what
passed
it
was
now
five
o'clock
in
the
evening
the
boats
had
cast
off
the
tow-lines
and
vied
with
each
other
in
their
exertions
before
the
sun
had
set
they
all
had
arrived
at
the
beach
and
were
safely
landed
in
the
little
sand
bay
into
which
they
had
steered
for
the
wind
was
off
the
shore
and
there
was
no
surf
the
boats
were
hauled
up
and
the
exhausted
men
lay
down
on
the
sands
till
warm
with
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
forgetting
that
they
had
neither
eaten
nor
drunk
for
so
long
a
time
they
were
soon
fast
asleep
captain
barentz
philip
and
krantz
as
soon
as
they
had
seen
the
boats
secured
held
a
short
consultation
and
were
then
glad
to
follow
the
example
of
the
seamen
harassed
and
worn
out
with
the
fatigue
of
the
last
twenty-four
hours
their
senses
were
soon
drowned
in
oblivion
for
many
hours
they
all
slept
soundly
dreamt
of
water
and
awoke
to
the
sad
reality
that
they
were
tormented
with
thirst
and
were
on
a
sandy
heath
with
the
salt
waves
mocking
them
but
they
reflected
how
many
of
their
late
companions
had
been
swallowed
up
and
felt
thankful
that
they
had
been
spared
it
was
early
dawn
when
they
all
rose
from
the
forms
which
they
had
impressed
on
the
yielding
sand
and
by
the
directions
of
philip
they
separated
in
every
direction
to
look
for
the
means
of
quenching
their
agony
of
thirst
as
they
proceeded
over
sand-hills
they
found
growing
in
the
sand
a
low
spongy-leaf
sort
of
shrub
something
like
what
in
our
greenhouses
is
termed
the
ice-plant
the
thick
leaves
of
which
were
covered
with
large
drops
of
dew
they
sank
down
on
their
knees
and
proceeded
from
one
to
the
other
licking
off
the
moisture
which
was
abundant
and
soon
felt
a
temporary
relief
they
continued
their
search
till
noon
without
success
and
hunger
was
now
added
to
their
thirst
they
then
returned
to
the
beach
to
ascertain
if
their
companions
had
been
more
successful
they
had
also
quenched
their
thirst
with
the
dew
of
heaven
but
had
found
no
water
or
means
of
subsistence
but
some
of
them
had
eaten
the
leaves
of
the
plant
which
had
contained
the
dew
in
the
morning
and
had
found
them
although
acid
full
of
watery
sap
and
grateful
to
the
palate
the
plant
in
question
is
the
one
provided
by
bounteous
providence
for
the
support
of
the
camel
and
other
beasts
in
the
arid
desert
only
to
be
found
there
and
devoured
by
all
ruminating
animals
with
avidity
by
the
advice
of
philip
they
collected
a
quantity
of
this
plant
and
put
it
into
the
boats
and
then
launched
they
were
not
more
than
fifty
miles
from
table
bay
and
although
they
had
no
sails
the
wind
was
in
their
favour
philip
pointed
out
to
them
how
useless
it
was
to
remain
when
before
morning
they
would
in
all
probability
arrive
at
where
they
would
obtain
all
they
required
the
advice
was
approved
of
and
acted
upon
the
boats
were
shoved
off
and
the
oars
resumed
so
tired
and
exhausted
were
the
men
that
their
oars
dipped
mechanically
into
the
water
for
there
was
no
strength
left
to
be
applied
it
was
not
until
the
next
morning
at
daylight
that
they
had
arrived
opposite
false
bay
and
they
had
still
many
miles
to
pull
the
wind
in
their
favour
had
done
almost
all--the
men
could
do
little
or
nothing
encouraged
however
by
the
sight
of
land
which
they
knew
they
rallied
and
about
noon
they
pulled
exhausted
to
the
beach
at
the
bottom
of
table
bay
near
to
which
were
the
houses
and
the
fort
protecting
the
settlers
who
had
for
some
few
years
resided
there
they
landed
close
to
where
a
broad
rivulet
at
that
season
but
a
torrent
in
the
winter
poured
its
stream
into
the
bay
at
the
sight
of
fresh
water
some
of
the
men
dropped
their
oars
threw
themselves
into
the
sea
when
out
of
their
depth--others
when
the
water
was
above
their
waists--yet
they
did
not
arrive
so
soon
as
those
who
waited
till
the
boat
struck
the
beach
and
jumped
out
upon
dry
land
and
then
they
threw
themselves
into
the
rivulet
which
coursed
over
the
shingle
about
five
or
six
inches
in
depth
allowing
the
refreshing
stream
to
pour
into
their
mouths
till
they
could
receive
no
more
immersing
their
hot
hands
and
rolling
in
it
with
delight
despots
and
fanatics
have
exerted
their
ingenuity
to
invent
torments
for
their
victims--how
useless--the
rack
the
boot
tire--all
that
they
have
imagined
are
not
to
be
compared
to
the
torture
of
extreme
thirst
in
the
extremity
of
agony
the
sufferers
cry
for
water
and
it
is
not
refused
they
might
have
spared
themselves
their
refined
ingenuity
of
torment
and
the
disgusting
exhibition
of
it
had
they
only
confined
the
prisoner
in
his
cell
and
refused
him
water
as
soon
as
they
satisfied
the
most
pressing
of
all
wants
they
rose
dripping
from
the
stream
and
walked
up
to
the
houses
of
the
factory
the
inhabitants
of
which
perceiving
that
boats
had
landed
when
there
was
no
vessel
in
the
bay
naturally
concluded
that
some
disaster
had
happened
and
were
walking
down
to
meet
them
their
tragical
history
was
soon
told
the
thirty-six
men
that
stood
before
them
were
all
that
were
left
of
nearly
three
hundred
souls
embarked
and
they
had
been
more
than
two
days
without
food
at
this
intimation
no
further
questions
were
asked
by
the
considerate
settlers
until
the
hunger
of
the
sufferers
had
been
appeased
when
the
narrative
of
their
sufferings
was
fully
detailed
by
philip
and
krantz
i
have
an
idea
that
i
have
seen
you
before
observed
one
of
the
settlers
did
you
come
on
shore
when
the
fleet
anchored
i
did
not
replied
philip
but
i
have
been
here
i
recollect
now
replied
the
man
you
were
the
only
survivor
of
the
ter
schilling
which
was
lost
in
false
bay
not
the
only
survivor
replied
philip
i
thought
so
myself
but
i
afterwards
met
the
pilot
a
one-eyed
man
of
the
name
of
schriften
who
was
my
shipmate
he
must
have
arrived
here
after
me
you
saw
him
of
course
no
i
did
not
no
one
belonging
to
the
ter
schilling
ever
came
here
after
you
for
i
have
been
a
settler
here
ever
since
and
it
is
not
likely
that
i
should
forget
such
a
circumstance
he
must
then
have
returned
to
holland
by
some
other
means
i
know
not
how
our
ships
never
go
near
the
coast
after
they
leave
the
bay
it
is
too
dangerous
nevertheless
i
saw
him
replied
philip
musing
if
you
saw
him
that
is
sufficient
perhaps
some
vessel
had
been
blown
down
to
the
eastern
side
and
picked
him
up
but
the
natives
in
that
part
are
not
likely
to
have
spared
the
life
of
a
european
the
caffres
are
a
cruel
people
the
information
that
schriften
had
not
been
seen
at
the
cape
was
a
subject
of
meditation
to
philip
he
had
always
had
an
idea
as
the
reader
knows
that
there
was
something
supernatural
about
the
man
and
this
opinion
was
corroborated
by
the
report
of
the
settler
we
must
pass
over
the
space
of
two
months
during
which
the
wrecked
seamen
were
treated
with
kindness
by
the
settlers
and
at
the
expiration
of
which
a
small
brig
arrived
at
the
bay
and
took
in
refreshments
she
was
homeward
bound
with
a
full
cargo
and
being
chartered
by
the
company
could
not
refuse
to
receive
on
board
the
crew
of
the
vrow
katerina
philip
krantz
and
the
seamen
embarked
but
captain
barentz
remained
behind
to
settle
at
the
cape
should
i
go
home
said
he
to
philip
who
argued
with
him
i
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
return
for
i
have
no
wife--no
children
i
had
but
one
dear
object
my
vrow
katerina
who
was
my
wife
my
child
my
everything--she
is
gone
and
i
never
shall
find
another
vessel
like
her
and
if
i
could
i
should
not
love
it
as
i
did
her
no
my
affections
are
buried
with
her--are
entombed
in
the
deep
sea
how
beautifully
she
burnt--she
went
out
of
the
world
like
a
phoenix
as
she
was
no
no
i
will
be
faithful
to
her--i
will
send
for
what
little
money
i
have
and
live
as
near
to
her
tomb
as
i
can--i
never
shall
forget
her
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
mourn
over
her
and
vrow
katerina'
when
i
die
will
be
found
engraven
on
my
heart
philip
could
not
help
wishing
that
his
affections
had
been
fixed
upon
a
more
deserving
object
as
then
probably
the
tragical
loss
had
not
taken
place
but
he
changed
the
subject
feeling
that
being
no
sailor
captain
barentz
was
much
better
on
shore
than
in
the
command
of
a
vessel
they
shook
hands
and
parted--philip
promising
to
execute
barentz's
commission
which
was
to
turn
his
money
into
articles
most
useful
to
a
settler
and
have
them
sent
out
by
the
first
fleet
which
should
sail
from
the
zuyder
zee
but
this
commission
it
was
not
philip's
good
fortune
to
execute
the
brig
named
the
wilhelmina
sailed
and
soon
arrived
at
st
helena
after
watering
she
proceeded
on
her
voyage
they
had
made
the
western
isles
and
philip
was
consoling
himself
with
the
anticipation
of
soon
joining
his
amine
when
to
the
northward
of
the
islands
they
met
with
a
furious
gale
before
which
they
were
obliged
to
scud
for
many
days
with
the
vessel's
head
to
the
south-east
and
as
the
wind
abated
and
they
were
able
to
haul
to
it
they
fell
in
with
a
dutch
fleet
of
five
vessels
commanded
by
an
admiral
which
had
left
amsterdam
more
than
two
months
and
had
been
buffeted
about
by
contrary
gales
for
the
major
part
of
that
period
cold
fatigue
and
bad
provisions
had
brought
on
the
scurvy
and
the
ships
were
so
weakly
manned
that
they
could
hardly
navigate
them
when
the
captain
of
the
wilhelmina
reported
to
the
admiral
that
he
had
part
of
the
crew
of
the
vrow
katerina
on
board
he
was
ordered
to
send
them
immediately
to
assist
in
navigating
his
crippled
fleet
remonstrance
was
useless
philip
had
but
time
to
write
to
amine
acquainting
her
with
his
misfortunes
and
disappointment
and
confiding
the
letter
to
his
wife
as
well
as
his
narrative
of
the
loss
of
the
vrow
katerina
for
the
directors
to
the
charge
of
the
captain
of
the
wilhelmina
he
hastened
to
pack
up
his
effects
and
repaired
on
board
of
the
admiral's
ship
with
krantz
and
the
crew
to
them
were
added
six
of
the
men
belonging
to
to
wilhelmina
whom
the
admiral
insisted
on
retaining
and
the
brig
having
received
the
admiral's
despatches
was
then
permitted
to
continue
her
voyage
perhaps
there
is
nothing
more
trying
to
the
seaman's
feelings
than
being
unexpectedly
forced
to
recommence
another
series
of
trials
at
the
very
time
when
they
anticipate
repose
from
their
former
yet
how
often
does
this
happen
philip
was
melancholy
it
is
my
destiny
thought
he
using
the
words
of
amine
and
why
should
i
not
submit
krantz
was
furious
and
the
seamen
discontented
and
mutinous
but
it
was
useless
might
is
right
on
the
vast
ocean
where
there
is
no
appeal--no
trial
or
injunction
to
be
obtained
but
hard
as
their
case
appeared
to
them
the
admiral
was
fully
justified
in
his
proceeding
his
ships
were
almost
unmanageable
with
the
few
hands
who
could
still
perform
their
duty
and
this
small
increase
of
physical
power
might
be
the
means
of
saving
hundreds
who
lay
helpless
in
their
hammocks
in
his
own
vessel
the
lion
which
was
manned
with
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
when
she
sailed
from
amsterdam
there
were
not
more
than
seventy
capable
of
doing
duty
and
the
other
ships
had
suffered
in
proportion
the
first
captain
of
the
lion
was
dead
the
second
captain
in
his
hammock
and
the
admiral
had
no
one
to
assist
him
but
the
mates
of
the
vessel
some
of
whom
crawled
up
to
their
duty
more
dead
than
alive
the
ship
of
the
second
in
command
the
dort
was
even
in
a
more
deplorable
plight
the
commodore
was
dead
the
first
captain
was
still
doing
his
duty
but
he
had
but
one
more
officer
capable
of
remaining
on
deck
the
admiral
sent
for
philip
into
his
cabin
and
having
heard
his
narrative
of
the
loss
of
the
vrow
katerina
he
ordered
him
to
go
on
board
the
commodore's
ship
as
captain
giving
the
rank
of
commodore
to
the
captain
at
present
on
board
of
her
krantz
was
retained
on
board
his
own
vessel
as
second
captain
for
by
philip's
narrative
the
admiral
perceived
at
once
that
they
were
both
good
officers
and
brave
men
the
fleet
under
admiral
rymelandt's
command
was
ordered
to
proceed
to
the
east
indies
by
the
western
route
through
the
straits
of
magellan
into
the
pacific
ocean--it
being
still
imagined
notwithstanding
previous
failures
that
this
route
offered
facilities
which
might
shorten
the
passage
to
the
spice
islands
the
vessels
composing
the
fleet
were
the
lion
of
forty-four
guns
bearing
the
admiral's
flag
the
dort
of
thirty-six
guns
with
the
commodore's
pendant--to
which
philip
was
appointed
the
zuyder
zee
of
twenty
the
young
frau
of
twelve
and
a
ketch
of
four
guns
called
the
schevelling
the
crew
of
the
vrow
katerina
were
divided
between
the
two
larger
vessels
the
others
being
smaller
were
easier
worked
with
fewer
hands
every
arrangement
having
been
made
the
boats
were
hoisted
up
and
the
ships
made
sail
for
ten
days
they
were
baffled
by
light
winds
and
the
victims
to
the
scurvy
increased
considerably
on
board
of
philip's
vessel
many
died
and
were
thrown
overboard
and
others
were
carried
down
to
their
hammocks
the
newly-appointed
commodore
whose
name
was
avenhorn
went
on
board
of
the
admiral
to
report
the
state
of
the
vessel
and
to
suggest
as
philip
had
proposed
to
him
that
they
should
make
the
coast
of
south
america
and
endeavour
by
bribery
or
by
force
to
obtain
supplies
either
from
the
spanish
inhabitants
or
the
natives
but
to
this
the
admiral
would
not
listen
he
was
an
imperious
bold
and
obstinate
man
not
to
be
persuaded
or
convinced
and
with
little
feeling
for
the
sufferings
of
others
tenacious
of
being
advised
he
immediately
rejected
a
proposition
which
had
it
originated
with
himself
would
probably
have
been
immediately
acted
upon
and
the
commodore
returned
on
board
his
vessel
not
only
disappointed
but
irritated
by
the
language
used
towards
him
what
are
we
do
captain
vanderdecken
you
know
too
well
our
situation--
it
is
impossible
we
can
continue
long
at
sea
if
we
do
the
vessel
will
be
drifting
at
the
mercy
of
the
waves
while
the
crew
die
a
wretched
death
in
their
hammocks
at
present
we
have
forty
men
left
in
ten
days
more
we
shall
probably
have
but
twenty
for
as
the
labour
becomes
more
severe
so
do
they
drop
down
the
faster
is
it
not
better
to
risk
our
lives
in
combat
with
the
spaniards
than
die
here
like
rotten
sheep
i
perfectly
agree
with
you
commodore
replied
philip--but
still
we
must
obey
orders
the
admiral
is
an
inflexible
man
and
a
cruel
one
i
have
a
great
mind
to
part
company
in
the
night
and
if
he
finds
fault
i
will
justify
myself
to
the
directors
on
my
return
do
nothing
rashly--perhaps
when
day
by
day
he
finds
his
own
ship's
company
more
weakened
he
will
see
the
necessity
of
following
your
advice
a
week
had
passed
away
after
this
conversation
and
the
fleet
had
made
little
progress
in
each
ship
the
ravages
of
the
fatal
disease
became
more
serious
and
as
the
commodore
had
predicted
he
had
but
twenty
men
really
able
to
do
duty
nor
had
the
admiral's
ship
and
the
other
vessels
suffered
less
the
commodore
again
went
on
board
to
reiterate
his
proposition
admiral
rymelandt
was
not
only
a
stern
but
a
vindictive
man
he
was
aware
of
the
propriety
of
the
suggestion
made
by
his
second
in
command
but
having
refused
it
he
would
not
acquiesce
and
he
felt
revengeful
against
the
commodore
whose
counsel
he
must
now
either
adopt
or
by
refusing
it
be
prevented
from
taking
the
steps
so
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
his
crew
and
the
success
of
his
voyage
too
proud
to
acknowledge
himself
in
error
again
did
he
decidedly
refuse
and
the
commodore
went
back
to
his
own
ship
the
fleet
was
then
within
three
days
of
the
coast
steering
to
the
southward
for
the
straits
of
magellan
and
that
night
after
philip
had
returned
to
his
cot
the
commodore
went
on
deck
and
ordered
the
course
of
the
vessel
to
be
altered
some
points
more
to
the
westward
the
night
was
very
dark
and
the
lion
was
the
only
ship
which
carried
a
poop-lantern
so
that
the
parting
company
of
the
dort
was
not
perceived
by
the
admiral
and
the
other
ships
of
the
fleet
when
philip
went
on
deck
next
morning
he
found
that
their
consorts
were
not
in
sight
he
looked
at
the
compass
and
perceiving
that
the
course
was
altered
inquired
at
what
hour
and
by
whose
directions
finding
that
it
was
by
his
superior
officer
he
of
course
said
nothing
when
the
commodore
came
on
deck
he
stated
to
philip
that
he
felt
himself
warranted
in
not
complying
with
the
admiral's
orders
as
it
would
have
been
sacrificing
the
whole
ship's
company
this
was
indeed
true
in
two
days
they
made
the
land
and
running
into
the
shore
perceived
a
large
town
and
spaniards
on
the
beach
then
anchored
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
hoisted
english
colours
when
a
boat
came
on
board
to
ask
them
who
they
were
and
what
they
required
the
commodore
replied
that
the
vessel
was
english
for
he
knew
that
the
hatred
of
the
spanish
to
the
dutch
was
so
great
that
if
known
to
belong
to
that
nation
he
would
have
had
no
chance
of
procuring
any
supplies
except
by
force
he
stated
that
he
had
fallen
in
with
a
spanish
vessel
a
complete
wreck
from
the
whole
of
the
crew
being
afflicted
with
the
scurvy
that
he
had
taken
the
men
out
who
were
now
in
their
hammocks
below
as
he
considered
it
cruel
to
leave
so
many
of
his
fellow-creatures
to
perish
and
that
he
had
come
out
of
his
course
to
land
them
at
the
first
spanish
fort
he
could
reach
he
requested
that
they
would
immediately
send
on
board
vegetables
and
fresh
provisions
for
the
sick
men
whom
it
would
be
death
to
remove
until
after
a
few
days
when
they
would
be
a
little
restored
and
added
that
in
return
for
their
assisting
the
spaniards
he
trusted
the
governor
would
also
send
supplies
for
his
own
people
this
well
made-up
story
was
confirmed
by
the
officer
sent
on
board
by
the
spanish
governor
being
requested
to
go
down
below
and
see
the
patients
the
sight
of
so
many
poor
fellows
in
the
last
stage
of
that
horrid
disease--their
teeth
fallen
out
gums
ulcerated
bodies
full
of
tumours
and
sores--was
quite
sufficient
and
hurrying
up
from
the
lower
deck
as
he
would
have
done
from
a
charnel-house
the
officer
hastened
on
shore
and
made
his
report
in
two
hours
a
large
boat
was
sent
off
with
fresh
beef
and
vegetables
sufficient
for
three
days'
supply
for
the
ship's
company
and
these
were
immediately
distributed
among
the
men
a
letter
of
thanks
was
returned
by
the
commodore
stating
that
his
health
was
so
indifferent
as
to
prevent
his
coming
on
shore
in
person
to
thank
the
governor
and
forwarding
a
pretended
list
of
the
spaniards
on
board
in
which
he
mentioned
some
officers
and
people
of
distinction
whom
he
imagined
might
be
connected
with
the
family
of
the
governor
whose
name
and
titles
he
had
received
from
the
messenger
sent
on
board
for
the
dutch
knew
full
well
the
majority
of
the
noble
spanish
families--indeed
alliances
had
continually
taken
place
between
them
previous
to
their
assertion
of
their
independence
the
commodore
concluded
his
letter
by
expressing
a
hope
that
in
a
day
or
two
he
should
be
able
to
pay
his
respects
and
make
arrangements
for
the
landing
of
the
sick
as
he
was
anxious
to
proceed
on
his
voyage
of
discovery
on
the
third
day
a
fresh
supply
of
provisions
was
sent
on
board
and
so
soon
as
they
were
received
the
commodore
in
an
english
uniform
went
on
shore
and
called
upon
the
governor
gave
a
long
detail
of
the
sufferings
of
the
people
he
had
rescued
and
agreed
that
they
should
be
sent
on
shore
in
two
days
as
they
would
by
that
time
be
well
enough
to
be
moved
after
many
compliments
he
went
on
board
the
governor
having
stated
his
intention
to
return
his
visit
on
the
following
day
if
the
weather
were
not
too
rough
fortunately
the
weather
was
rough
for
the
next
two
days
and
it
was
not
until
the
third
that
the
governor
made
his
appearance
this
was
precisely
what
the
commodore
wished
there
is
no
disease
perhaps
so
dreadful
or
so
rapid
in
its
effects
upon
the
human
frame
and
at
the
same
time
so
instantaneously
checked
as
the
scurvy
if
the
remedy
can
be
procured
a
few
days
were
sufficient
to
restore
those
who
were
not
able
to
turn
in
their
hammocks
to
their
former
vigour
in
the
course
of
the
six
days
nearly
all
the
crew
of
the
dort
were
convalescent
and
able
to
go
on
deck
but
still
they
were
not
cured
the
commodore
waited
for
the
arrival
of
the
governor
received
him
with
all
due
honours
and
then
so
soon
as
he
was
in
the
cabin
told
him
very
politely
that
he
and
all
his
officers
with
him
were
prisoners
that
the
vessel
was
a
dutch
man-of-war
and
that
it
was
his
own
people
and
not
spaniards
who
had
been
dying
of
the
scurvy
he
consoled
him
however
by
pointing
out
that
he
had
thought
it
preferable
to
obtain
provisions
by
this
ruse
than
to
sacrifice
lives
on
both
sides
by
taking
them
by
force
and
that
his
excellency's
captivity
would
endure
no
longer
than
until
he
had
received
on
board
a
sufficient
number
of
live
bullocks
and
fresh
vegetables
to
insure
the
recovery
of
the
ship's
company
and
in
the
mean
time
not
the
least
insult
would
be
offered
to
him
whereupon
the
spanish
governor
first
looked
at
the
commodore
and
then
at
the
file
of
armed
men
at
the
cabin-door
and
then
to
his
distance
from
the
town
and
then
called
to
mind
the
possibility
of
his
being
taken
out
to
sea
weighing
all
these
points
in
his
mind
and
the
very
moderate
ransom
demanded
for
bullocks
were
not
worth
a
dollar
a
piece
in
that
country
he
resolved
as
he
could
not
help
himself
to
comply
with
the
commodore's
terms
he
called
for
pen
and
ink
and
wrote
an
order
to
send
on
board
immediately
all
that
was
demanded
before
sunset
the
bullocks
and
vegetables
were
brought
off
and
so
soon
as
they
were
alongside
the
commodore
with
many
bows
and
many
thanks
escorted
the
governor
to
the
gangway
complimenting
him
with
a
salvo
of
great
guns
as
he
had
done
before
on
his
arrival
the
people
on
shore
thought
that
his
excellency
had
paid
a
long
visit
but
as
he
did
not
like
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
been
deceived
nothing
was
said
about
it
at
least
in
his
hearing
although
the
facts
were
soon
well
known
as
soon
as
the
boats
were
cleared
the
commodore
weighed
anchor
and
made
sail
well
satisfied
with
having
preserved
his
ship's
company
and
as
the
falkland
islands
in
case
of
parting
company
had
been
named
as
the
rendezvous
he
steered
for
them
in
a
fortnight
he
arrived
and
found
that
his
admiral
was
not
yet
there
his
crew
were
now
all
recovered
and
his
fresh
beef
was
not
yet
expended
when
he
perceived
the
admiral
and
the
three
other
vessels
in
the
offing
it
appeared
that
so
soon
as
the
dort
had
parted
company
the
admiral
had
immediately
acted
upon
the
advice
that
the
commodore
had
given
him
and
had
run
for
the
coast
not
being
so
fortunate
in
a
ruse
as
his
second
in
command
he
had
landed
an
armed
force
from
the
four
vessels
and
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
several
head
of
cattle
at
the
expense
of
an
equal
number
of
men
killed
and
wounded
but
at
the
same
time
they
had
collected
a
large
quantity
of
vegetables
of
one
sort
or
another
which
they
had
carried
on
board
and
distributed
with
great
success
to
the
sick
who
were
gradually
recovering
immediately
that
the
admiral
had
anchored
he
made
the
signal
for
the
commodore
to
repair
on
board
and
taxed
him
with
disobedience
of
orders
in
having
left
the
fleet
the
commodore
did
not
deny
that
he
had
so
done
but
excused
himself
upon
the
plea
of
necessity
offering
to
lay
the
whole
matter
before
the
court
of
directors
so
soon
as
they
returned
but
the
admiral
was
vested
with
most
extensive
powers
not
only
of
the
trial
but
the
condemnation
and
punishment
of
any
person
guilty
of
mutiny
and
insubordination
in
his
fleet
in
reply
he
told
the
commodore
that
he
was
a
prisoner
and
to
prove
it
he
confined
him
in
irons
under
the
half-deck
a
signal
was
then
made
for
all
the
captains
they
went
on
board
and
of
course
philip
was
of
the
number
on
their
arrival
the
admiral
held
a
summary
court-martial
proving
to
them
by
his
instructions
that
he
was
so
warranted
to
do
the
result
of
the
court-martial
could
be
but
one--
condemnation
for
a
breach
of
discipline
to
which
philip
was
obliged
reluctantly
to
sign
his
name
the
admiral
then
gave
philip
the
appointment
of
second
in
command
and
the
commodore's
pendant
much
to
the
annoyance
of
the
captains
commanding
the
other
vessels
but
in
this
the
admiral
proved
his
judgment
as
there
was
no
one
of
them
so
fit
for
the
task
as
philip
having
so
done
he
dismissed
them
philip
would
have
spoken
to
the
late
commodore
but
the
sentry
opposed
it
as
against
his
orders
and
with
a
friendly
nod
philip
was
obliged
to
leave
him
without
the
desired
communication
the
fleet
remained
three
weeks
at
the
falkland
islands
to
recruit
the
ships'
companies
although
there
was
no
fresh
beef
there
was
plenty
of
scurvy-grass
and
penguins
these
birds
were
in
myriads
on
some
parts
of
the
island
which
from
the
propinquity
of
their
nests
built
of
mud
went
by
the
name
of
towns
there
they
sat
close
together
the
whole
area
which
they
covered
being
bare
of
grass
hatching
their
eggs
and
rearing
their
young
the
men
had
but
to
select
as
many
eggs
and
birds
as
they
pleased
and
so
numerous
were
they
that
when
they
had
supplied
themselves
there
was
no
apparent
diminution
of
the
numbers
this
food
although
in
a
short
time
not
very
palatable
to
the
seamen
had
the
effect
of
restoring
them
to
health
and
before
the
fleet
sailed
there
was
not
a
man
who
was
afflicted
with
the
scurvy
in
the
mean
time
the
commodore
remained
in
irons
and
many
were
the
conjectures
concerning
his
ultimate
fate
the
power
of
life
and
death
was
known
to
be
in
the
admiral's
hands
but
no
one
thought
that
such
power
would
be
exerted
up
on
a
delinquent
of
so
high
a
grade
the
other
captains
kept
aloof
from
philip
and
he
knew
little
of
what
was
the
general
idea
occasionally
when
on
board
of
the
admiral's
ship
he
ventured
to
bring
up
the
question
but
was
immediately
silenced
and
feeling
that
he
might
injure
the
late
commodore
for
whom
he
had
a
regard
he
would
risk
nothing
by
importunity
and
the
fleet
sailed
for
the
straits
of
magellan
without
anybody
being
aware
of
what
might
be
the
result
of
the
court-martial
it
was
about
a
fortnight
after
they
had
left
the
falkland
islands
that
they
entered
the
straits
at
first
they
had
a
leading
wind
which
carried
them
half
through
but
this
did
not
last
and
they
then
had
to
contend
not
only
against
the
wind
but
against
the
current
and
they
daily
lost
ground
the
crews
of
the
ships
also
began
to
sicken
from
fatigue
and
cold
whether
the
admiral
had
before
made
up
his
mind
or
whether
irritated
by
his
fruitless
endeavours
to
continue
his
voyage
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
after
three
weeks'
useless
struggle
against
the
wind
and
currents
he
hove
to
and
ordered
the
captains
on
board
when
he
proposed
that
the
prisoner
should
receive
his
punishment--and
that
punishment
was--to
be
deserted
that
is
to
be
sent
on
shore
with
a
day's
food
where
there
was
no
means
of
obtaining
support
so
as
to
die
miserably
of
hunger
this
was
a
punishment
frequently
resorted
to
by
the
dutch
at
that
period
as
will
be
seen
by
reading
an
account
of
their
voyages
but
at
the
same
time
seldom
if
ever
awarded
to
one
of
so
high
a
rank
as
that
of
commodore
philip
immediately
protested
against
it
and
so
did
krantz
although
they
were
both
aware
that
by
so
doing
they
would
make
the
admiral
their
enemy
but
the
other
captains
who
viewed
both
of
them
with
a
jealous
eye
and
considered
them
as
interlopers
and
interfering
with
their
advancement
sided
with
the
admiral
notwithstanding
this
majority
philip
thought
it
his
duty
to
expostulate
you
know
well
admiral
said
he
that
i
joined
in
his
condemnation
for
a
breach
of
discipline
but
at
the
same
time
there
was
much
in
extenuation
he
committed
a
breach
of
discipline
to
save
his
ship's
company
but
not
an
error
in
judgment
as
you
yourself
proved
by
taking
the
same
measure
to
save
your
own
men
do
not
therefore
visit
an
offence
of
so
doubtful
a
nature
with
such
cruelty
let
the
company
decide
the
point
when
you
send
him
home
which
you
can
do
so
soon
as
you
arrive
in
india
he
is
sufficiently
punished
by
losing
his
command
to
do
what
you
propose
will
be
ascribed
to
feelings
of
revenge
more
than
to
those
of
justice
what
success
can
we
deserve
if
we
commit
an
act
of
such
cruelty
and
how
can
we
expect
a
merciful
providence
to
protect
us
from
the
winds
and
waves
when
we
are
thus
barbarous
towards
each
other
philip's
arguments
were
of
no
avail
the
admiral
ordered
him
to
return
on
board
his
ship
and
had
he
been
able
to
find
an
excuse
he
would
have
deprived
him
of
his
command
this
he
could
not
well
do
but
philip
was
aware
that
the
admiral
was
now
his
inveterate
enemy
the
commodore
was
taken
out
of
irons
and
brought
into
the
cabin
and
his
sentence
was
made
known
to
him
be
it
so
admiral
replied
avenhorn
for
to
attempt
to
turn
you
from
your
purpose
i
know
would
be
unavailing
i
am
not
punished
for
disobedience
of
orders
but
for
having
by
my
disobedience
pointed
out
to
you
your
duty--a
duty
which
you
were
forced
to
perform
afterwards
by
necessity
then
be
it
so
let
me
perish
on
these
black
rocks
as
i
shall
and
my
bones
be
whitened
by
the
chilly
blasts
which
howl
over
their
desolation
but
mark
me
cruel
and
vindictive
man
i
shall
not
be
the
only
one
whose
bones
will
bleach
there
i
prophesy
that
many
others
will
share
my
fate
and
even
you
admiral
may
be
of
the
number--if
i
mistake
not
we
shall
lie
side
by
side
the
admiral
made
no
reply
but
gave
a
sign
for
the
prisoner
to
be
removed
he
then
had
a
conference
with
the
captains
of
the
three
smaller
vessels
and
as
they
had
been
all
along
retarded
by
the
heavier
sailing
of
his
own
ship
and
the
dort
commanded
by
philip
he
decided
that
they
should
part
company
and
proceed
on
as
fast
as
they
could
to
the
indies--sending
on
board
of
the
two
larger
vessels
all
the
provisions
they
could
spare
as
they
already
began
to
run
short
philip
had
left
the
cabin
with
krantz
after
the
prisoner
had
been
removed
he
then
wrote
a
few
lines
upon
a
slip
of
paper--do
not
leave
the
beach
when
you
are
put
on
shore
until
the
vessels
are
out
of
sight
and
requesting
krantz
to
find
an
opportunity
to
deliver
this
to
the
commodore
he
returned
on
board
of
his
own
ship
when
the
crew
of
the
dort
heard
of
the
punishment
about
to
be
inflicted
upon
their
old
commander
they
were
much
excited
they
felt
that
he
had
sacrificed
himself
to
save
them
and
they
murmured
much
at
the
cruelty
of
the
admiral
about
an
hour
after
philip's
return
to
his
ship
the
prisons
was
sent
on
shore
and
landed
on
the
desolate
and
rocky
coast
with
a
supply
of
provisions
for
two
days
not
a
single
article
of
extra
clothing
or
the
means
of
striking
a
light
was
permitted
him
when
the
boat's
keel
grazed
the
beach
ha
was
ordered
out
the
boat
shoved
off
and
the
men
were
not
permitted
even
to
bid
him
farewell
the
fleet
as
philip
had
expected
remained
hove
to
shifting
the
provisions
and
it
was
not
till
after
dark
that
everything
was
arranged
this
opportunity
was
not
lost
philip
was
aware
that
it
would
be
considered
a
breach
of
discipline
but
to
that
he
was
indifferent
neither
did
he
think
it
likely
that
it
would
come
to
the
ears
of
the
admiral
as
the
crew
of
the
dort
were
partial
both
to
the
commodore
and
to
him
he
had
desired
a
seaman
whom
he
could
trust
to
put
into
one
of
the
boats
a
couple
of
muskets
and
a
quantity
of
ammunition
several
blankets
and
various
other
articles
besides
provisions
for
two
or
three
months
for
one
person
and
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
the
men
pulled
on
shore
with
the
boat
found
the
commodore
on
the
beach
waiting
for
them
and
supplied
him
with
all
these
necessaries
they
then
rejoined
their
ship
without
the
admiral's
having
the
least
suspicion
of
what
had
been
done
and
shortly
after
the
fleet
made
sail
on
a
wind
with
their
heads
off
shore
the
next
morning
the
three
smaller
vessels
parted
company
and
by
sunset
had
gained
many
miles
to
windward
after
which
they
were
not
again
seen
the
admiral
had
sent
for
philip
to
give
him
his
instructions
which
were
very
severe
and
evidently
framed
so
as
to
be
able
to
afford
him
hereafter
some
excuse
for
depriving
him
of
his
command
among
others
his
orders
were
as
the
dort
drew
much
less
water
than
the
admiral's
ship
to
sail
ahead
of
him
during
the
night
that
if
they
approached
too
near
the
land
as
they
beat
across
the
channel
timely
notice
might
be
given
to
the
admiral
if
in
too
shallow
water
this
responsibility
was
the
occasion
of
philip's
being
always
on
deck
when
they
approached
the
land
on
either
side
of
the
straits
it
was
the
second
night
after
the
fleet
had
separated
that
philip
had
been
summoned
on
deck
as
they
were
nearing
the
land
of
terra
del
fuego
he
was
watching
the
man
in
the
chains
heaving
the
head
when
the
officer
of
the
watch
reported
to
him
that
the
admiral's
ship
was
ahead
of
them
instead
of
astern
philip
made
inquiry
as
to
when
he
passed
but
could
not
discover
he
went
forward
and
saw
the
admiral's
ship
with
her
poop-light
which
when
the
admiral
was
astern
was
not
visible
what
can
be
the
admiral's
reason
for
this
thought
philip
has
he
run
ahead
for
purpose
to
make
a
charge
against
me
of
neglect
of
duty
it
must
be
so
well
let
him
do
as
he
pleases
he
must
wait
now
till
we
arrive
in
india
for
i
shall
not
allow
him
to
desert
me
and
with
the
company
i
have
as
much
and
i
rather
think
as
a
large
proprietor
more
interest
than
he
has
well
as
he
has
thought
proper
to
go
ahead
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
follow
you
may
come
out
of
the
chains
there'
philip
went
forward
they
were
now
as
he
imagined
very
near
to
the
land
but
the
night
was
dark
and
they
could
not
distinguish
it
for
half
an
hour
they
continued
their
course
much
to
philip's
surprise
for
he
now
thought
he
could
make
out
the
loom
of
the
land
dark
as
it
was
his
eyes
were
constantly
fixed
upon
the
ship
ahead
expecting
every
minute
that
she
would
go
about
but
no
she
continued
her
course
and
philip
followed
with
his
own
vessel
we
are
very
close
to
the
land
sir
observed
vander
hagen
the
lieutenant
who
was
the
officer
of
the
watch
so
it
appears
to
me
but
the
admiral
is
closer
and
draws
much
more
water
than
we
do
replied
philip
i
think
i
see
the
rocks
on
the
beam
to
leeward
sir
i
believe
you
are
right
replied
philip
i
cannot
understand
this
ready
about
and
get
a
gun
ready--they
must
suppose
us
to
be
ahead
of
them
depend
up
on
it
hardly
had
philip
given
the
order
when
the
vessel
struck
heavily
on
the
rocks
philip
hastened
aft
he
found
that
the
rudder
had
been
unshipped
and
the
vessel
was
immovably
fixed
his
thoughts
then
reverted
to
the
admiral
was
he
on
shore
he
ran
forward
and
the
admiral
was
still
sailing
on
with
his
poop-light
about
two
cables'
length
ahead
of
him
fire
the
gun
there
cried
philip
perplexed
beyond
measure
the
gun
was
fired
and
immediately
followed
up
by
the
flash
and
report
of
another
gun
close
astern
of
them
philip
looked
with
astonishment
over
the
quarter
and
perceived
the
admiral's
ship
close
astern
to
him
and
evidently
on
shore
as
well
as
his
own
merciful
heaven
exclaimed
philip
rushing
forward
what
can
this
be
he
beheld
the
other
vessel
with
her
light
ahead
still
sailing
on
and
leaving
them
the
day
was
now
dawning
and
there
was
sufficient
light
to
make
out
the
land
the
dort
was
on
shore
not
fifty
yards
from
the
beach
and
surrounded
by
the
high
and
barren
rocks
yet
the
vessel
ahead
was
apparently
sailing
on
over
the
land
the
seamen
crowded
on
the
forecastle
watching
this
strange
phenomenon
at
last
it
vanished
from
their
sight
that's
the
flying
dutchman
by
all
that's
holy
cried
one
of
the
seamen
jumping
off
the
gun
hardly
had
the
man
uttered
these
words
when
the
vessel
disappeared
philip
felt
convinced
that
it
was
so
and
he
walked
away
aft
in
a
very
perturbed
state
it
must
have
been
his
father's
fatal
ship
which
had
decoyed
them
to
probable
destruction
he
hardly
knew
how
to
act
the
admiral's
wrath
he
did
not
wish
just
at
that
moment
to
encounter
he
sent
for
the
officer
of
the
watch
and
having
desired
him
to
select
a
crew
for
the
boat
out
of
those
men
who
had
been
on
deck
and
could
substantiate
his
assertions
ordered
him
to
go
on
board
of
the
admiral
and
state
what
had
happened
as
soon
as
the
boat
had
shoved
off
philip
turned
his
attention
to
the
state
of
his
own
vessel
the
daylight
had
increased
and
philip
perceived
that
they
were
surrounded
by
rocks
and
had
run
on
shore
between
two
reefs
which
extended
half
a
mile
from
the
mainland
he
sounded
round
his
vessel
and
discovered
that
she
was
fixed
from
forward
to
aft
and
that
without
lightening
her
there
was
no
chance
of
getting
her
off
he
then
turned
to
where
the
admiral's
ship
lay
aground
and
found
that
to
all
appearance
she
was
in
even
a
worse
plight
as
the
rocks
to
leeward
of
her
were
above
the
water
and
she
was
much
more
exposed
should
bad
weather
come
on
never
perhaps
was
there
a
scene
more
cheerless
and
appalling
a
dark
wintry
sea--a
sky
loaded
with
heavy
clouds--the
wind
cold
and
piercing--the
whole
line
of
the
coast
one
mass
of
barren
rocks
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
vegetation
the
inland
part
of
the
country
presented
an
equally
sombre
appearance
and
the
higher
points
were
capped
with
snow
although
it
was
not
yet
the
winter
season
sweeping
the
coast
with
his
eye
philip
perceived
not
four
miles
to
leeward
of
them
so
little
progress
had
they
made
the
spot
where
they
had
deserted
the
commodore
surely
this
has
been
a
judgment
on
him
for
his
cruelty
thought
philip
and
the
prophecy
of
poor
avenhorn
will
come
true--more
bones
than
his
will
bleach
on
those
rocks
philip
turned
round
again
to
where
the
admiral's
ship
was
on
shore
and
started
back
as
he
beheld
a
sight
even
more
dreadful
than
all
that
he
had
viewed--the
body
of
vander
hagen
the
officer
sent
on
board
of
the
admiral
hanging
at
the
main-yard-arm
my
god
is
it
possible
exclaimed
philip
stamping
with
sorrow
and
indignation
his
boat
was
returning
on
board
and
philip
awaited
it
with
impatience
the
men
hastened
up
the
side
and
breathlessly
informed
philip
that
the
admiral
as
soon
as
he
had
heard
the
lieutenant's
report
and
his
acknowledgment
that
he
was
officer
of
the
watch
had
ordered
him
to
be
hung
and
that
he
had
sent
them
back
with
a
summons
for
him
to
repair
on
board
immediately
and
that
they
had
seen
another
rope
preparing
at
the
other
yardarm
but
not
for
you
sir
cried
the
men--that
shall
never
be--you
shall
not
go
on
board--and
we
will
defend
you
with
our
lives
the
whole
ship's
company
joined
in
this
resolution
and
expressed
their
determination
to
resist
the
admiral
philip
thanked
them
kindly--stated
his
intention
of
not
going
on
board
and
requested
that
they
would
remain
quiet
until
it
was
ascertained
what
steps
the
admiral
might
take
he
then
went
down
to
his
cabin
to
reflect
upon
what
plan
he
should
proceed
as
he
looked
out
of
the
stern
windows
and
perceived
the
body
of
the
young
man
still
swinging
in
the
wind
he
almost
wished
that
he
was
in
his
place
for
then
there
would
be
an
end
to
his
wayward
fate
but
he
thought
of
amine
and
felt
that
for
her
he
wished
to
live
that
the
phantom
ship
should
have
decoyed
him
to
destruction
was
also
a
source
of
much
painful
feeling
and
philip
meditated
with
his
hands
pressed
to
his
temples
it
is
my
destiny
thought
he
at
last
and
the
will
of
heaven
must
be
done
we
could
not
have
been
so
deceived
if
heaven
had
not
permitted
it
and
then
his
thoughts
reverted
to
his
present
situation
that
the
admiral
had
exceeded
his
powers
in
taking
the
life
of
the
officer
was
undeniable
as
although
his
instructions
gave
him
power
of
life
and
death
still
it
was
only
to
be
decided
by
the
sentence
of
the
court-martial
held
by
the
captains
commanding
the
vessels
of
the
fleet
he
therefore
felt
himself
justified
in
resistance
but
philip
was
troubled
with
the
idea
that
such
resistance
might
lead
to
much
bloodshed
and
he
was
still
debating
how
to
act
when
they
reported
to
him
that
there
was
a
boat
coming
from
the
admiral's
ship
philip
went
upon
deck
to
receive
the
officer
who
stated
that
it
was
the
admiral's
order
that
he
should
immediately
come
on
board
and
that
he
must
consider
himself
now
under
arrest
and
deliver
up
his
sword
no
no
exclaimed
the
ship's
company
of
the
dort
he
shall
not
go
on
board
we
will
stand
by
our
captain
to
the
last
silence
men
silence
cried
philip
you
must
be
aware
sir
said
he
to
the
officer
that
in
the
cruel
punishment
of
that
innocent
young
man
the
admiral
has
exceeded
his
powers
and
much
as
i
regret
to
see
any
symptoms
of
mutiny
and
insubordination
it
must
be
remembered
that
if
those
in
command
disobey
the
orders
they
have
received
by
exceeding
them
they
not
only
set
the
example
but
give
an
excuse
for
those
who
otherwise
would
be
bound
to
obey
them
to
do
the
same
tell
the
admiral
that
his
murder
of
that
innocent
man
has
determined
me
no
longer
to
consider
myself
under
his
authority
and
that
i
will
hold
myself
as
well
as
him
answerable
to
the
company
whom
we
serve
for
our
conduct
i
do
not
intend
to
go
on
board
and
put
myself
in
his
power
that
he
might
gratify
his
resentment
by
my
ignominious
death
it
is
a
duty
that
i
owe
these
men
under
my
command
to
preserve
my
life
that
i
may
if
possible
preserve
theirs
in
this
strait
and
you
may
also
add
that
a
little
reflection
must
point
out
to
him
that
this
is
no
time
for
us
to
war
with
but
to
assist
each
other
with
all
our
energies
we
are
here
shipwrecked
on
a
barren
coast
with
provisions
insufficient
for
any
lengthened
stay
no
prospect
of
succour
and
little
of
escape
as
the
commodore
truly
prophesied
many
more
are
likely
to
perish
as
well
as
him--and
even
the
admiral
himself
may
be
of
the
number
i
shall
wait
his
answer
if
he
choose
to
lay
aside
all
animosity
and
refer
our
conduct
to
a
higher
tribunal
i
am
willing
to
join
with
him
in
rendering
that
assistance
to
each
other
which
our
situation
requires--if
not
you
must
perceive
and
of
course
will
tell
him
that
i
have
those
with
me
who
will
defend
me
against
any
attempt
at
force
you
have
my
answer
sir
and
may
return
on
board
the
officer
went
to
the
gangway
but
found
that
none
of
his
crew
except
the
bowman
were
in
the
boat
they
had
gone
up
to
gain
from
the
men
of
the
dort
the
true
history
of
what
they
but
imperfectly
heard
and
before
they
were
summoned
to
return
had
received
full
intelligence
they
coincided
with
the
seamen
of
the
dort
that
the
appearance
of
the
phantom
ship
which
had
occasioned
their
present
disaster
was
a
judgment
upon
the
admiral
for
his
conduct
in
having
so
cruelly
deserted
the
poor
commodore
upon
the
return
of
the
officer
with
philip's
answer
the
rage
of
the
admiral
was
beyond
all
bounds
he
ordered
the
guns
aft
which
would
bear
upon
the
dort
to
be
double-shotted
and
fired
into
her
but
krantz
pointed
out
to
him
that
they
could
not
bring
more
guns
to
bear
upon
the
dort
in
their
present
situation
than
the
dort
could
bring
to
bear
upon
them
that
their
superior
force
was
thus
neutralised
and
that
no
advantage
could
result
from
taking
such
a
step
the
admiral
immediately
put
krantz
under
arrest
and
proceeded
to
put
into
execution
his
insane
intentions
in
this
he
was
however
prevented
by
the
seamen
of
the
lion
who
neither
wished
to
fire
upon
their
consort
or
to
be
fired
at
in
return
the
report
of
the
boat's
crew
had
been
circulated
through
the
ship
and
the
men
felt
too
much
ill-will
against
the
admiral
an
perceived
at
the
same
time
the
extreme
difficulty
of
their
situation
to
wish
to
make
it
worse
they
did
not
proceed
to
open
mutiny
but
they
went
down
below
and
when
the
officers
ordered
them
up
they
refused
to
go
upon
deck
and
the
officers
who
were
equally
disgusted
with
the
admiral's
conduct
merely
informed
him
of
the
state
of
the
ship's
company
without
naming
individuals
so
as
to
excite
his
resentment
against
any
one
in
particular
such
was
the
state
of
affairs
when
the
sun
went
down
nothing
had
been
done
on
board
the
admiral's
ship
for
krantz
was
under
arrest
and
the
admiral
had
retired
in
a
state
of
fury
to
his
cabin
in
the
mean
time
philip
and
the
ship's
company
had
not
been
idle--they
had
laid
an
anchor
out
astern
and
hove
taut
they
had
started
all
the
water
and
were
pumping
it
out
when
a
boat
pulled
alongside
and
krantz
made
his
appearance
on
deck
captain
vanderdecken
i
have
come
to
put
myself
under
your
orders
if
you
will
receive
me--if
not
render
me
your
protection
for
as
sure
as
fate
i
should
have
been
hanged
to-morrow
morning
if
i
had
remained
in
my
own
ship
the
men
in
the
boat
have
come
with
the
same
intention--
that
of
joining
you
if
you
will
permit
them
although
philip
would
have
wished
it
had
been
otherwise
he
could
not
well
refuse
to
receive
krantz
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
he
was
very
partial
to
him
and
to
save
his
life
which
certainly
was
in
danger
he
would
have
done
much
more
he
desired
that
the
boat's
crew
should
return
but
when
krantz
had
stated
to
him
what
had
occurred
on
board
the
lion
and
the
crew
earnestly
begged
him
not
to
send
them
back
to
almost
certain
death
which
their
having
effected
the
escape
of
krantz
would
have
assured
philip
reluctantly
allowed
them
to
remain
the
night
was
tempestuous
but
the
wind
being
now
off
shore
the
water
was
not
rough
the
crew
of
the
dort
under
the
directions
of
philip
and
krantz
succeeded
in
lightening
the
vessel
so
much
during
the
night
that
the
next
morning
they
were
able
to
haul
her
off
and
found
that
her
bottom
had
received
no
serious
injury
it
was
fortunate
for
them
that
they
had
not
discontinued
their
exertions
for
the
wind
shifted
a
few
hours
before
sunrise
and
by
the
time
that
they
had
shipped
their
rudder
it
came
on
to
blow
fresh
down
the
straits
the
wind
being
accompanied
with
a
heavy
swell
the
admiral's
ship
still
lay
aground
and
apparently
no
exertions
were
used
to
get
her
off
philip
was
much
puzzled
how
to
act
leave
the
crew
of
the
lion
he
could
not
nor
indeed
could
he
refuse
or
did
he
wish
to
refuse
the
admiral
if
he
proposed
coming
on
board
but
he
now
made
up
his
mind
that
it
should
only
be
as
a
passenger
and
that
he
would
himself
retain
the
command
at
present
he
contented
himself
with
dropping
his
anchor
outside
clear
of
the
reef
where
he
was
sheltered
by
a
bluff
cape
under
which
the
water
was
smooth
about
a
mile
distant
from
where
the
admiral's
ship
lay
on
shore
and
he
employed
his
crew
in
replenishing
his
water-casks
from
a
rivulet
close
to
where
the
ship
was
anchored
he
waited
to
see
if
the
other
vessel
got
off
being
convinced
that
if
she
did
not
some
communication
must
soon
take
place
as
soon
as
the
water
was
complete
he
sent
one
of
his
boats
to
the
place
where
the
commodore
had
been
landed
having
resolved
to
take
him
on
board
if
they
could
find
him
but
the
boat
returned
without
having
seen
anything
of
him
although
the
men
had
clambered
over
the
hills
to
a
considerable
distance
on
the
second
morning
after
philip
had
hauled
his
vessel
off
they
observed
that
the
boats
of
the
admiral's
ship
were
passing
and
repassing
from
the
shore
landing
her
stores
and
provisions
and
the
next
day
from
the
tents
pitched
on
shore
it
was
evident
that
she
was
abandoned
although
the
boats
were
still
employed
in
taking
articles
out
of
her
that
night
it
blew
fresh
and
the
sea
was
heavy
the
next
morning
her
masts
were
gone
and
she
turned
on
her
broadside
she
was
evidently
a
wreck
and
philip
now
consulted
with
krantz
how
to
act
to
leave
the
crew
of
the
lion
on
shore
was
impossible
they
must
all
perish
when
the
winter
set
in
upon
such
a
desolate
coast
on
the
whole
it
was
considered
advisable
that
the
first
communication
should
come
from
the
other
party
and
philip
resolved
to
remain
quietly
at
anchor
it
was
very
plain
that
there
was
no
longer
any
subordination
among
the
crew
of
the
lion
who
were
to
be
seen
in
the
day
time
climbing
over
the
rocks
in
every
direction
and
at
night
when
their
large
fires
were
lighted
carousing
and
drinking
this
waste
of
provisions
was
a
subject
of
much
vexation
to
philip
he
had
not
more
than
sufficient
for
his
own
crew
and
he
took
it
for
granted
that
so
soon
as
what
they
had
taken
on
shore
should
be
expended
the
crew
of
the
lion
would
ask
to
be
received
on
board
of
the
dort
for
more
than
a
week
did
affairs
continue
in
this
state
when
one
morning
a
boat
was
seen
pulling
towards
the
ship
and
in
the
stern-sheets
philip
recognised
the
officer
who
had
been
sent
on
board
to
put
him
under
arrest
when
the
officer
came
on
deck
he
took
off
his
hat
to
philip
you
do
then
acknowledge
me
as
in
command
observed
philip
yes
sir
most
certainly
you
were
second
in
command
but
now
you
are
first--for
the
admiral
is
dead
dead
exclaimed
philip--and
how
he
was
found
dead
on
the
beach
under
a
high
cliff
and
the
body
of
the
commodore
was
in
his
arms
indeed
they
were
both
grappled
together
it
is
supposed
that
in
his
walk
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
which
he
used
to
take
every
day
to
see
if
any
vessels
might
be
in
the
straits
he
fell
in
with
the
commodore--that
they
had
come
to
contention
and
had
both
fallen
over
the
precipice
together
no
one
saw
the
meeting
but
they
must
have
fallen
over
the
rocks
as
the
bodies
are
dreadfully
mangled
on
inquiry
philip
ascertained
that
all
chance
of
saving
the
lion
had
been
lost
after
the
second
night
when
she
had
beat
in
her
larboard
streak
and
six
feet
water
in
the
hold
that
the
crew
had
been
very
insubordinate
and
had
consumed
almost
all
the
spirits
and
that
not
only
all
the
sick
had
already
perished
but
also
many
others
who
had
either
fallen
over
the
rocks
when
they
were
intoxicated
or
had
been
found
dead
in
the
morning
from
their
exposure
during
the
night
then
the
poor
commodore's
prophecy
has
been
fulfilled
observed
philip
to
krantz
many
others
and
even
the
admiral
himself
have
perished
with
him--peace
be
with
them
and
now
let
us
get
away
from
this
horrible
place
as
soon
as
possible
philip
then
gave
orders
to
the
officer
to
collect
his
men
and
the
provisions
that
remained
for
immediate
embarkation
krantz
followed
soon
after
with
all
the
boats
and
before
night
everything
was
on
board
the
bodies
of
the
admiral
and
commodore
were
buried
where
they
lay
and
the
next
morning
the
dort
was
under
weigh
and
with
a
slanting
wind
was
laying
a
fair
course
through
the
straits
it
appeared
as
if
their
misfortunes
were
to
cease
after
the
tragical
death
of
the
two
commanders
in
a
few
days
the
dort
had
passed
through
the
straits
of
magellan
and
was
sailing
in
the
pacific
ocean
with
a
blue
sky
and
quiet
sea
the
ship's
company
recovered
their
health
and
spirits
and
the
vessel
being
now
well
manned
the
duty
was
carried
on
with
cheerfulness
in
about
a
fortnight
they
had
gained
well
up
on
the
spanish
coast
but
although
they
had
seen
many
of
the
inhabitants
on
the
beach
they
had
not
fallen
in
with
any
vessels
belonging
to
the
spaniards
aware
that
if
he
met
with
a
spanish
ship
of
superior
force
it
would
attack
him
philip
had
made
every
preparation
and
had
trained
his
men
to
the
guns
he
had
now
with
the
joint
crews
of
the
vessels
a
well-manned
ship
and
the
anticipation
of
prize-money
had
made
his
men
very
eager
to
fall
in
with
some
spaniard
which
they
knew
that
philip
would
capture
if
he
could
light
winds
and
calms
detained
them
for
a
month
on
the
coast
when
philip
determined
upon
running
for
the
isle
st
marie
where
though
he
knew
it
was
in
possession
of
the
spaniards
he
yet
hoped
to
be
able
to
procure
refreshments
for
the
ship's
company
either
by
fair
means
or
by
force
the
dort
was
by
their
reckoning
about
thirty
miles
from
the
island
and
having
run
in
until
after
dark
they
had
hove
to
till
the
next
morning
krantz
was
on
deck
he
leant
over
the
side
and
as
the
sails
flapped
to
the
masts
he
attempted
to
define
the
line
of
the
horizon
it
was
very
dark
but
as
he
watched
he
thought
that
he
perceived
a
light
for
a
moment
and
which
then
disappeared
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
spot
he
soon
made
out
a
vessel
hove
to
and
not
two
cables'
length
distant
he
hastened
down
to
apprise
philip
and
procure
a
glass
by
the
time
philip
was
on
deck
the
vessel
had
been
distinctly
made
out
to
be
a
three-masted
xebeque
very
low
in
the
water
after
a
short
consultation
it
was
agreed
that
the
boats
on
the
quarter
should
be
lowered
down
and
manned
and
armed
without
noise
and
that
they
should
steal
gently
alongside
and
surprise
her
the
men
were
called
up
silence
enjoined
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
boat's
crew
had
possession
of
the
vessel
having
boarded
her
and
secured
the
hatches
before
the
alarm
could
be
given
by
the
few
who
were
on
deck
more
men
were
then
taken
on
board
by
krantz
who
as
agreed
upon
lay
to
under
the
lee
of
the
dort
until
the
daylight
made
its
appearance
the
hatches
were
then
taken
off
and
the
prisoners
sent
on
board
of
the
dort
there
were
sixty
people
on
board--a
large
number
for
a
vessel
of
that
description
on
being
interrogated
two
of
the
prisoners
who
were
well-dressed
and
gentlemanlike
persons
stepped
forward
and
stated
that
the
vessel
was
from
st
mary's
bound
to
lima
with
a
cargo
of
flour
and
passengers
that
the
crew
and
captain
consisted
of
twenty-five
men
and
all
the
rest
who
were
on
board
had
taken
that
opportunity
of
going
to
lima
that
they
themselves
were
among
the
passengers
and
trusted
that
the
vessel
and
cargo
would
be
immediately
released
as
the
two
nations
were
not
at
war
not
at
war
at
home
i
grant
replied
philip
but
in
these
seas
the
constant
aggressions
of
your
armed
ships
compel
me
to
retaliate
and
i
shall
therefore
make
a
prize
of
your
vessel
and
cargo
at
the
same
time
as
i
have
no
wish
to
molest
private
individuals
i
will
land
all
the
passengers
and
crew
at
st
mary's
to
which
place
i
am
bound
in
order
to
obtain
refreshments
which
now
i
shall
expect
will
be
given
cheerfully
as
your
ransom
so
as
to
relieve
me
from
resorting
to
force
the
prisoners
protested
strongly
against
this
but
without
avail
they
then
requested
leave
to
ransom
the
vessel
and
cargo
offering
a
larger
sum
than
they
both
appeared
to
be
worth
but
philip
being
short
of
provisions
refused
to
part
with
the
cargo
and
the
spaniards
appeared
much
disappointed
at
the
unsuccessful
issue
of
their
request
finding
that
nothing
would
induce
him
to
part
with
the
provisions
they
then
begged
hard
to
ransom
the
vessel
and
to
this
after
a
consultation
with
krantz
philip
gave
his
assent
the
two
vessels
then
made
sail
and
steered
on
for
the
island
then
about
four
leagues
distant
although
philip
had
not
wished
to
retain
the
vessel
yet
as
they
stood
in
together
her
superior
speed
became
so
manifest
that
he
almost
repented
that
he
had
agreed
to
ransom
her
at
noon
the
dort
was
anchored
in
the
roads
out
of
gunshot
and
a
portion
of
the
passengers
allowed
to
go
on
shore
and
make
arrangements
for
the
ransom
of
the
remainder
while
the
prize
was
hauled
alongside
and
her
cargo
hoisted
into
the
ship
towards
evening
three
large
boats
with
livestock
and
vegetables
and
the
sum
agreed
upon
for
the
ransom
of
the
xebeque
came
alongside
and
as
soon
as
one
of
the
boats
was
cleared
the
prisoners
were
permitted
to
go
on
shore
in
it
with
the
exception
of
the
spanish
pilot
who
at
the
suggestion
of
krantz
was
retained
with
a
promise
of
being
released
directly
the
dort
was
clear
of
the
spanish
seas
a
negro
slave
was
also
at
his
own
request
allowed
to
remain
on
board
much
to
the
annoyance
of
the
two
passengers
before
mentioned
who
claimed
the
man
as
their
property
and
insisted
that
it
was
an
infraction
of
the
agreement
which
had
been
entered
into
you
prove
my
right
by
your
own
words
replied
philip
i
agreed
to
deliver
up
all
the
passengers
but
no
property
the
slave
will
remain
on
board
finding
their
endeavours
ineffectual
the
spaniards
took
a
haughty
leave
the
dort
remained
at
anchor
that
night
to
examine
her
rigging
and
the
next
morning
they
discovered
that
the
xebeque
had
disappeared
having
sailed
unperceived
by
them
during
the
night
as
soon
as
the
anchor
was
up
and
sail
made
on
the
ship
philip
went
down
to
his
cabin
with
krantz
to
consult
as
to
their
best
course
they
were
followed
by
the
negro
slave
who
shutting
the
door
and
looking
watchfully
round
said
that
he
wished
to
speak
with
them
his
information
was
most
important
but
given
rather
too
late
the
vessel
which
had
been
ransomed
was
a
government
advice-boat
the
fastest
sailer
the
spaniards
possessed
the
pretended
two
passengers
were
officers
of
the
spanish
navy
and
the
others
were
the
crew
of
the
vessel
she
had
been
sent
down
to
collect
the
bullion
and
take
it
to
lima
and
at
the
same
time
to
watch
for
the
arrival
of
the
dutch
fleet
intelligence
of
whose
sailing
had
been
some
time
before
received
overland
when
the
dutch
fleet
made
its
appearance
she
was
to
return
to
lima
with
the
news
and
a
spanish
force
would
be
detached
against
it
they
further
learnt
that
some
of
the
supposed
casks
of
flour
contained
2000
gold
doubloons
each
others
bars
of
silver
this
precaution
having
been
taken
in
case
of
capture
that
the
vessel
had
now
sailed
for
lima
there
was
no
doubt
the
reason
why
the
spaniards
were
so
anxious
not
to
leave
the
negro
on
board
of
the
dort
was
that
they
knew
that
he
would
disclose
what
he
now
had
done
as
for
the
pilot
he
was
a
man
whom
the
spaniards
knew
they
could
trust
and
for
that
reason
they
had
better
be
careful
of
him
or
he
would
lead
the
dort
into
some
difficulty
philip
now
repented
that
he
had
ransomed
the
vessel
as
he
would
in
all
probability
have
to
meet
and
cope
with
a
superior
force
before
he
could
make
his
way
clear
out
of
these
seas
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
consulted
with
krantz
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
send
for
the
ship's
company
and
make
them
acquainted
with
these
facts
arguing
that
a
knowledge
of
the
valuable
capture
which
they
had
made
would
induce
the
men
to
fight
well
and
stimulate
them
with
the
hopes
of
further
success
the
ship's
company
heard
the
intelligence
with
delight
professed
themselves
ready
to
meet
double
their
force
and
then
by
the
directions
of
philip
the
casks
were
brought
up
on
the
quarter-deck
opened
and
the
bullion
taken
out
the
whole
when
collected
amounted
to
about
half
a
million
of
dollars
as
near
as
they
could
estimate
it
and
a
distribution
of
the
coined
money
was
made
from
the
capstan
the
very
next
day
the
bars
of
metal
being
reserved
until
they
could
be
sold
and
their
value
ascertained
for
six
weeks
philip
worked
his
vessel
up
the
coast
without
falling
in
with
any
vessel
under
sail
notice
had
been
given
by
the
advice-boat
as
it
appeared
and
every
craft
large
and
small
was
at
anchor
under
the
batteries
they
had
nearly
run
up
the
whole
coast
and
philip
had
determined
that
the
next
day
he
would
stretch
across
to
batavia
when
a
ship
was
seen
in-shore
under
a
press
of
sail
running
towards
lima
chase
was
immediately
given
but
the
water
shoaled
and
the
pilot
was
asked
if
they
could
stand
on
he
replied
in
the
affirmative
stating
that
they
were
now
in
the
shallowest
water
and
that
it
was
deeper
within
the
leadsman
was
ordered
into
the
chains
but
at
the
first
heave
the
lead-line
broke
another
was
sent
for
and
the
dort
still
carried
on
under
a
heavy
press
of
sail
just
then
the
negro
slave
went
up
to
philip
and
told
him
that
he
had
seen
the
pilot
with
his
knife
in
the
chains
and
that
he
thought
he
must
have
cut
the
lead-line
so
far
through
as
to
occasion
its
being
carried
away
and
told
philip
not
to
trust
him
the
helm
was
immediately
put
down
but
as
the
ship
went
round
she
touched
on
the
bank
dragged
and
was
again
clear--scoundrel
cried
philip
so
you
cut
the
lead-line
the
negro
saw
you
and
has
saved
us
the
spaniard
leaped
down
from
off
the
gun
and
before
he
could
be
prevented
had
buried
his
knife
in
the
heart
of
the
negro
maldetto
take
that
for
your
pains
cried
he
in
a
fury
grinding
his
teeth
and
flourishing
his
knife
the
negro
fell
dead
the
pilot
was
seized
and
disarmed
by
the
crew
of
the
dort
who
were
partial
to
the
negro
as
it
was
from
his
information
that
they
had
become
rich
let
them
do
with
him
as
they
please
said
krantz
to
philip
yes
replied
philip
summary
justice
the
crew
debated
a
few
minutes
and
then
lashed
the
pilot
to
the
negro
and
carried
him
off
to
the
taffrail
there
was
a
heavy
plunge
and
he
disappeared
under
the
eddying
waters
in
the
wake
of
the
vessel
philip
now
determined
to
shape
his
course
for
batavia
he
was
within
a
few
days'
sail
of
lima
and
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
vessels
had
been
sent
out
to
intercept
him
with
a
favourable
wind
he
now
stood
away
from
the
coast
and
for
three
days
made
a
rapid
passage
on
the
fourth
at
daylight
two
vessels
appeared
to
windward
bearing
down
upon
him
that
they
were
large
armed
vessels
was
evident
and
the
display
of
spanish
ensigns
and
pennants
as
they
rounded
to
about
a
mile
to
windward
soon
showed
that
they
were
enemies
they
proved
to
be
a
frigate
of
a
larger
size
than
the
dort
and
a
corvette
of
twenty-two
guns
the
crew
of
the
dort
showed
no
alarm
at
this
disparity
of
force
they
clinked
their
doubloons
in
their
pockets
vowed
not
to
return
them
to
their
lawful
owners
if
they
could
help
it
and
flew
with
alacrity
to
their
guns
the
dutch
ensign
was
displayed
in
defiance
and
the
two
spanish
vessels
again
putting
their
heads
towards
the
dort
that
they
might
lessen
their
distance
received
some
raking
shot
which
somewhat
discomposed
them
but
they
rounded
to
at
a
cable's
length
and
commenced
the
action
with
great
spirit
the
frigate
lying
on
the
beam
and
the
corvette
on
the
bow
of
philip's
vessel
after
half
an
hour's
determined
exchange
of
broadsides
the
fore-mast
of
the
spanish
frigate
fell
carrying
away
with
it
the
maintop-mast
and
this
accident
impeded
her
firing
the
dort
immediately
made
sail
stood
on
to
the
corvette
which
she
crippled
with
three
or
four
broadsides
then
tacked
and
fetched
alongside
of
the
frigate
whose
lee
guns
were
still
impeded
with
the
wreck
of
the
foremast
the
two
vessels
now
lay
head
and
stern
within
ten
feet
of
each
other
and
the
action
recommenced
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
spaniard
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
canvass
hanging
overside
caught
fire
from
the
discharge
of
the
guns
and
very
soon
communicated
to
the
ship
the
dort
still
pouring
in
a
most
destructive
broadside
which
could
not
be
effectually
returned
after
every
attempt
to
extinguish
the
flames
the
captain
of
the
spanish
vessel
resolved
that
both
vessels
should
share
the
same
fate
he
put
his
helm
up
and
running
her
on
to
the
dort
grappled
with
her
and
attempted
to
secure
the
two
vessels
together
then
raged
the
conflict
the
spaniards
attempting
to
pass
their
grappling-chains
so
as
to
prevent
the
escape
of
their
enemy
and
the
dutch
endeavouring
to
frustrate
their
attempt
the
chains
and
sides
of
hot
vessels
were
crowded
with
men
fighting
desperately
those
struck
down
falling
between
the
two
vessels
which
the
wreck
of
the
foremast
still
prevented
from
coming
into
actual
collision
during
this
conflict
philip
and
krantz
were
not
idle
by
squaring
the
after-yards
and
putting
all
sail
on
forward
they
contrived
that
the
dort
should
pay
off
before
the
wind
with
her
antagonist
and
by
this
manoeuvre
they
cleared
themselves
of
the
smoke
which
so
incommoded
them
and
having
good
way
on
the
two
vessels
they
then
rounded
to
so
as
to
get
on
the
other
tack
and
bring
the
spaniard
to
leeward
this
gave
them
a
manifest
advantage
and
soon
terminated
the
conflict
the
smoke
and
flames
were
beat
back
on
the
spanish
vessel--the
fire
which
had
communicated
to
the
dort
was
extinguished--the
spaniards
were
no
longer
able
to
prosecute
their
endeavours
to
fasten
the
two
vessels
together
and
retreated
to
within
the
bulwarks
of
their
own
vessel
and
after
great
exertions
the
dort
was
disengaged
and
forged
ahead
of
her
opponent
who
was
soon
enveloped
in
a
sheet
of
flame
the
corvette
remained
a
few
cables'
length
to
windward
occasionally
firing
a
gun
philip
poured
in
a
broadside
and
she
hauled
down
her
colours
the
action
might
now
be
considered
at
an
end
and
the
object
was
to
save
the
crew
of
the
burning
frigate
the
boats
of
the
dort
were
hoisted
out
but
only
two
of
them
would
swim
one
of
them
was
immediately
despatched
to
the
corvette
with
orders
for
her
to
send
all
her
boats
to
the
assistance
of
the
frigate
which
was
done
and
the
major
part
of
the
surviving
crew
were
saved
for
two
hours
the
guns
of
the
frigate
as
they
were
heated
by
the
flames
discharged
themselves
and
then
the
fire
having
communicated
to
the
magazine
she
blew
up
and
the
remainder
of
her
hull
sank
slowly
and
disappeared
among
the
prisoners
in
the
uniform
of
the
spanish
service
philip
perceived
the
two
pretended
passengers
this
proving
the
correctness
of
the
negro's
statement
the
two
men-of-war
had
been
sent
out
of
lima
on
purpose
to
intercept
him
anticipating
with
such
a
preponderating
force
an
easy
victory
after
some
consultation
with
krantz
philip
agreed
that
as
the
corvette
was
in
such
a
crippled
state
and
the
nations
were
not
actually
at
war
it
would
be
advisable
to
release
her
with
all
the
prisoners
this
was
done
and
the
dort
again
made
sail
for
batavia
and
anchored
in
the
roads
three
weeks
after
the
combat
had
taken
the
place
he
found
the
remainder
of
the
fleet
which
had
been
despatched
before
them
and
had
arrived
there
some
weeks
had
taken
in
their
cargoes
and
were
ready
to
sail
for
holland
philip
wrote
his
despatches
in
which
he
communicated
to
the
directors
the
events
of
the
voyage
and
then
went
on
shore
to
reside
at
the
house
of
the
merchant
who
had
formerly
received
him
until
the
dort
could
be
freighted
for
her
voyage
home
we
must
return
to
amine
who
is
seated
on
the
mossy
bank
where
she
and
philip
conversed
when
they
were
interrupted
by
schriften
the
pilot
she
is
in
deep
thought
with
her
eyes
cast
down
as
if
trying
to
recall
the
past
alas
for
my
mother's
power
exclaimed
she
but
it
is
gone--gone
for
ever
this
torment
and
suspense
i
cannot
bear--those
foolish
priests
too
and
amine
rose
from
the
bank
and
walked
towards
her
cottage
father
mathias
had
not
returned
to
lisbon
at
first
he
had
not
found
an
opportunity
and
afterwards
his
debt
of
gratitude
towards
philip
induced
him
to
remain
by
amine
who
appeared
each
day
to
hold
more
in
aversion
the
tenets
of
the
christian
faith
many
and
many
were
the
consultations
with
father
seysen
many
were
the
exhortations
of
both
the
good
old
men
to
amine
who
at
times
would
listen
without
reply
and
at
others
argue
boldly
against
them
it
appeared
to
them
that
she
rejected
their
religion
with
an
obstinacy
as
unpardonable
as
it
was
incomprehensible
but
to
her
the
case
was
more
simple
she
refused
to
believe
she
said
that
which
she
could
not
understand
she
went
so
far
as
to
acknowledge
the
beauty
of
the
principles
the
purity
of
the
doctrine
but
when
the
good
priests
would
enter
into
the
articles
of
their
faith
amine
would
either
shake
her
head
or
attempt
to
turn
the
conversation
this
only
increased
the
anxiety
of
the
good
father
mathias
to
convert
and
save
the
soul
of
one
so
young
and
beautiful
and
he
now
no
longer
thought
of
returning
to
lisbon
but
devoted
his
whole
time
to
the
instruction
of
amine
who
wearied
by
his
incessant
importunities
almost
loathed
his
presence
upon
reflection
it
will
not
appear
surprising
that
amine
rejected
a
creed
so
dissonant
to
her
wishes
and
intentions
the
human
mind
is
of
that
proud
nature
that
it
requires
all
its
humility
to
be
called
into
action
before
it
will
bow
even
to
the
deity
amine
knew
that
her
mother
had
possessed
superior
knowledge
and
an
intimacy
with
unearthly
intelligences
she
had
seen
her
practise
her
art
with
success
although
so
young
at
the
time
that
she
could
not
now
recall
to
mind
the
mystic
preparations
by
which
her
mother
had
succeeded
in
her
wishes
and
it
was
now
that
her
thoughts
were
wholly
bent
upon
recovering
what
she
had
forgotten
that
father
mathias
was
exhorting
her
to
a
creed
which
positively
forbade
even
the
attempt
the
peculiar
and
awful
mission
of
her
husband
strengthened
her
opinion
in
the
lawfulness
of
calling
in
the
aid
of
supernatural
agencies
and
the
arguments
brought
forward
by
these
worthy
but
not
over-talented
professors
of
the
christian
creed
had
but
little
effect
upon
a
mind
so
strong
and
so
decided
as
that
of
amine--a
mind
which
bent
as
it
was
upon
one
object
rejected
with
scorn
tenets
in
roof
of
which
they
could
offer
no
visible
manifestation
and
which
would
have
bound
her
blindly
to
believe
what
appeared
to
her
contrary
to
common
sense
that
her
mother's
art
could
bring
evidence
of
its
truth
she
had
already
shown
and
satisfied
herself
in
the
effect
of
the
dream
which
she
had
proved
upon
philip--
but
what
proof
could
they
bring
forward--records--which
they
would
not
permit
her
to
read
oh
that
i
had
my
mother's
art
repeated
amine
once
more
as
she
entered
the
cottage
then
would
i
know
where
i
was
at
this
moment
oh
for
the
black
mirror
in
which
i
used
to
peer
at
her
command
and
tell
her
what
passed
in
array
before
me
how
well
do
i
remember
that
time--
the
time
of
my
father's
absence
when
i
looked
into
the
liquid
on
the
palm
of
my
hand
and
told
her
of
the
bedouin
camp--of
the
skirmish--the
horse
without
a
rider--and
the
turban
on
the
sand
and
again
amine
fell
into
deep
thought
yes
cried
she
after
a
time
thou
canst
assist
me
mother
give
me
in
a
dream
thy
knowledge
thy
daughter
begs
it
as
a
boon
let
me
think
again
the
word--what
was
the
word
what
was
the
name
of
the
spirit--turshoon
yes
methinks
it
was
turshoon
mother
mother
help
your
daughter
dost
thou
call
upon
the
blessed
virgin
my
child
said
father
mathias
who
had
entered
the
room
as
she
pronounced
the
last
words
if
so
thou
dost
well
for
she
may
appear
to
thee
in
thy
dreams
and
strengthen
thee
in
the
true
faith
i
called
upon
my
own
mother
who
is
in
the
land
of
spirits
good
father
replied
amine
yes
but
as
an
infidel
not
i
fear
in
the
land
of
the
blessed
spirits
my
child
she
hardly
will
be
punished
for
following
the
creed
of
her
fathers
living
where
she
did
where
no
other
creed
was
known
replied
amine
indignantly
if
the
good
on
earth
are
blessed
in
the
next
world--if
she
had
as
you
assert
she
had
a
soul
to
be
saved--an
immortal
spirit--
he
who
made
that
spirit
will
not
destroy
it
because
she
worshipped
as
her
fathers
did
her
life
was
good
why
should
she
be
punished
for
ignorance
of
that
creed
which
she
never
had
an
opportunity
of
rejecting
who
shall
dispute
the
will
of
heaven
my
child
be
thankful
that
you
are
permitted
to
be
instructed
and
to
be
received
into
the
bosom
of
the
holy
church
i
am
thankful
for
many
things
father
but
i
am
weary
and
must
wish
you
a
good
night
amine
retired
to
her
room--but
not
to
sleep
once
more
did
she
attempt
the
ceremonies
used
by
her
mother
changing
them
each
time
as
doubtful
of
her
success
again
the
censer
was
lighted--the
charms
essayed
again
the
room
was
filled
with
smoke
as
she
threw
in
the
various
herbs
which
she
had
knowledge
of
for
all
the
papers
thrown
aside
at
her
father's
death
had
been
carefully
collected
and
on
many
were
directions
found
as
to
the
use
of
those
herbs
the
word
the
word
i
have
the
first--the
second
word
help
me
mother
cried
amine
as
she
sat
by
the
side
of
the
bed
in
the
room
which
was
now
so
full
of
smoke
that
nothing
could
be
distinguished
it
is
of
no
use
thought
she
at
last
letting
her
hands
fall
at
her
side
i
have
forgotten
the
art
mother
mother
help
me
in
my
dreams
this
night
the
smoke
gradually
cleared
away
and
when
amine
lifted
up
her
eyes
she
perceived
a
figure
standing
before
her
at
first
she
thought
she
had
been
successful
in
her
charm
but
as
the
figure
became
more
distinct
she
perceived
that
it
was
father
mathias
who
was
looking
at
her
with
a
severe
frown
and
contracted
brow
his
arms
folded
before
him
unholy
child
what
dost
thou
amine
had
roused
the
suspicions
of
the
priests
not
only
by
her
conversation
but
by
several
attempts
which
she
had
before
made
to
recover
her
lost
art
and
on
one
occasion
in
which
she
had
defended
it
both
father
mathias
and
father
seysen
had
poured
out
the
bitterest
anathemas
upon
her
or
any
one
who
had
resort
to
such
practices
the
smell
of
the
fragrant
herbs
thrown
into
the
censer
and
the
smoke
which
afterwards
had
escaped
through
the
door
and
ascended
the
stairs
had
awakened
the
suspicious
of
father
mathias
and
he
had
crept
up
silently
and
entered
the
room
without
her
perceiving
it
amine
at
once
perceived
her
danger
had
she
been
single
she
would
have
dared
the
priest
but
for
philip's
sake
she
determined
to
mislead
him
i
do
no
wrong
father
replied
she
calmly
but
it
appears
to
me
not
seemly
that
you
should
enter
the
chamber
of
a
young
woman
during
her
husband's
absence
i
might
have
been
in
my
bed
it
is
a
strange
intrusion
thou
canst
not
mean
this
woman
my
age--my
profession--are
a
sufficient
warranty
replied
father
mathias
somewhat
confused
at
this
unexpected
attack
not
always
father
if
what
i
have
been
told
of
monks
and
priests
be
true
replied
amine
i
ask
again
why
comest
thou
here
into
an
unprotected
woman's
chamber
because
i
felt
convinced
that
she
was
practising
unholy
arts
unholy
arts--what
mean
you
is
the
leech's
skill
unholy
is
it
unholy
to
administer
relief
to
those
who
suffer--to
charm
the
fever
and
the
ague
which
rack
the
limbs
of
those
who
live
in
this
unwholesome
climate
all
charms
are
most
unholy
when
i
said
charms
father
i
meant
not
what
you
mean
i
simply
would
have
said
a
remedy
if
a
knowledge
of
certain
powerful
herbs
which
properly
combined
will
form
a
specific
to
ease
the
suffering
wretch--an
art
well
known
unto
my
mother
and
which
i
now
would
fain
recall--if
that
knowledge
or
a
wish
to
regain
that
knowledge
be
unholy
then
are
you
correct
i
heard
thee
call
upon
thy
mother
for
her
help
i
did
for
she
well
knew
the
ingredients
but
i
i
fear
have
not
the
knowledge
that
she
had
is
that
sinful
good
father
'tis
then
a
remedy
that
you
would
find
replied
the
priest
i
thought
that
thou
didst
practise
that
which
is
most
unlawful
can
the
burning
of
a
few
weeds
be
then
unlawful
what
did
you
expect
to
find
look
you
father
at
these
ashes--they
may
with
oil
be
rubbed
into
the
pores
and
give
relief--but
can
they
do
more
what
do
you
expect
from
them--a
ghost--a
spirit--like
the
prophet
raised
for
the
king
of
israel
and
amine
laughed
aloud
i
am
perplexed
but
not
convinced
replied
the
priest
i
too
am
perplexed
and
not
convinced
responded
amine
scornfully
i
cannot
satisfy
myself
that
a
man
of
your
discretion
could
really
suppose
that
there
was
mischief
in
burning
weeds
nor
am
i
convinced
that
such
was
the
occasion
of
your
visit
at
this
hour
of
the
night
to
a
lone
woman's
chamber
there
may
be
natural
charms
more
powerful
than
those
you
call
supernatural
i
pray
you
father
leave
this
chamber
it
is
not
seemly
should
you
again
presume
you
leave
the
house
i
thought
better
of
you
in
future
i
will
not
be
left
at
any
time
alone
this
attack
of
amine's
upon
the
reputation
of
the
old
priest
was
too
severe
father
mathias
immediately
quitted
the
room
saying
as
he
went
out
may
god
forgive
you
for
your
false
suspicions
and
great
injustice
i
came
here
for
the
cause
i
have
stated
and
no
more
yes
soliloquised
amine
as
the
door
closed
i
know
you
did
but
i
must
rid
myself
of
your
unwelcome
company
i
will
have
no
spy
upon
my
actions--no
meddler
to
thwart
me
in
my
will
in
your
zeal
you
have
committed
yourself
and
i
will
take
the
advantage
you
have
given
me
is
not
the
privacy
of
a
woman's
chamber
to
be
held
sacred
by
you
sacred
men
in
return
for
assistance
in
distress--for
food
and
shelter--you
would
become
a
spy
how
grateful
and
how
worthy
of
the
creed
which
you
profess
amine
opened
her
door
as
soon
as
she
had
removed
the
censer
and
summoned
one
of
the
women
of
the
house
to
stay
that
night
in
her
room
stating
that
the
priest
had
entered
her
chamber
and
she
did
not
like
the
intrusion
holy
father
is
it
possible
replied
the
woman
amine
made
no
reply
but
went
to
bed
but
father
mathias
heard
all
that
passed
as
he
paced
the
room
below
the
next
day
he
called
upon
father
seysen
and
communicated
to
him
what
had
occurred
and
the
false
suspicions
of
amine
you
have
acted
hastily
replied
father
seysen
to
visit
a
woman's
chamber
at
such
an
hour
of
the
night
i
had
my
suspicions
good
father
seysen
and
she
will
have
hers
she
is
young
and
beautiful
now
by
the
blessed
virgin--
i
absolve
you
good
mathias
replied
father
seysen
but
still
if
known
it
would
occasion
much
scandal
to
our
church
and
known
it
soon
was
for
the
woman
who
had
been
summoned
by
amine
did
not
fail
to
mention
the
circumstance
and
father
mathias
found
himself
everywhere
so
coldly
received
and
besides
so
ill
at
ease
with
himself
that
he
very
soon
afterwards
quitted
the
country
and
returned
to
lisbon
angry
with
himself
for
his
imprudence
but
still
more
angry
with
amine
for
her
unjust
suspicions
the
cargo
of
the
dort
was
soon
ready
and
philip
sailed
and
arrived
at
amsterdam
without
any
further
adventure
that
he
reached
his
cottage
and
was
received
with
delight
by
amine
need
hardly
be
said
she
had
been
expecting
him
for
the
two
ships
of
the
squadron
which
had
sailed
on
his
arrival
at
batavia
and
which
had
charge
of
his
despatches
had
of
course
carried
letters
to
her
from
philip
the
first
letters
she
had
ever
received
from
him
during
his
voyages
six
weeks
after
the
letters
philip
himself
made
his
appearance
and
amine
was
happy
the
directors
were
of
course
highly
satisfied
with
philip's
conduct
and
he
was
appointed
to
the
command
of
a
large
armed
ship
which
was
to
proceed
to
india
in
the
spring
one-third
of
which
according
to
agreement
was
purchased
by
philip
out
of
the
funds
which
he
had
in
the
hands
of
the
company
he
had
now
five
months
of
quiet
and
repose
to
pass
away
previous
to
his
once
more
trusting
to
the
elements
and
this
time
as
it
was
agreed
he
had
to
make
arrangements
on
board
for
the
reception
of
amine
amine
narrated
to
philip
what
had
occurred
between
her
and
the
priest
mathias
and
by
what
means
she
had
rid
herself
of
his
unwished
for
surveillance
and
were
you
practising
your
mother's
arts
amine
nay
not
practising
them
for
i
could
not
recall
them
but
i
was
trying
to
recover
them
why
so
amine
this
must
not
be
it
is
as
the
good
father
said
unholy'
promise
me
you
will
abandon
them
now
and
for
ever
if
that
act
be
unholy
philip
so
is
your
mission
you
would
deal
and
co-operate
with
the
spirits
of
another
world--i
would
do
no
more
abandon
your
terrific
mission--abandon
your
seeking
after
disembodied
spirits
stay
at
home
with
you
amine
and
she
will
cheerfully
comply
with
your
request
mine
is
an
awful
summons
from
the
most
high
then
the
most
high
permits
your
communion
with
those
who
are
not
of
this
world
he
does
you
know
even
the
priests
do
not
gainsay
it
although
they
shudder
at
the
very
thought
if
then
he
permits
to
one
he
will
to
another
nay
ought
that
i
can
do
is
but
with
his
permission
yes
amine
so
does
he
permit
evil
to
stalk
on
the
earth
but
he
countenances
it
not
he
countenances
your
seeking
after
your
doomed
father
your
attempts
to
meet
him
nay
more
he
commands
it
if
you
are
thus
permitted
why
may
not
i
be
i
am
your
wife
a
portion
of
yourself
and
when
i
am
left
over
a
desolate
hearth
while
you
pursue
your
course
of
danger
may
not
i
appeal
also
to
the
immaterial
world
to
give
me
that
intelligence
which
will
soothe
my
sorrow
lighten
my
burden
and
which
at
the
same
time
can
hurt
no
living
creature
did
i
attempt
to
practise
these
arts
for
evil
purposes
it
were
just
to
deny
them
me
am
wrong
to
continue
them
but
i
would
but
follow
in
the
step
of
my
husband
and
seek
as
he
seeks
with
a
good
intent
but
it
is
contrary
to
our
faith
have
the
priests
declared
your
mission
contrary
to
their
faith
or
if
they
have
have
they
not
been
convinced
to
the
contrary
and
been
awed
to
silence
but
why
argue
my
dear
philip
shall
i
not
now
be
with
you
and
while
with
you
i
will
attempt
no
more
you
have
my
promise
but
if
separated
i
will
not
say
but
i
shall
then
require
of
the
invisible
a
knowledge
of
my
husband's
motions
when
in
search
of
the
invisible
also
the
winter
passed
rapidly
away
for
it
was
passed
by
philip
in
quiet
and
happiness
the
spring
came
on
the
vessel
was
to
be
fitted
out
and
philip
and
amine
repaired
to
amsterdam
the
utrecht
was
the
name
of
the
vessel
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
a
ship
of
400
tons
newly
launched
and
pierced
for
twenty-four
guns
two
more
months
passed
away
during
which
philip
superintended
the
fitting
and
loading
of
the
vessel
assisted
by
his
favourite
krantz
who
served
in
her
as
first
mate
every
convenience
and
comfort
that
philip
could
think
of
was
prepared
for
amine
and
in
the
month
of
may
he
started
with
orders
to
stop
at
gambroon
and
ceylon
run
down
the
straits
of
sumatra
and
from
thence
to
force
his
way
into
the
china
seas
the
company
having
every
reason
to
expect
from
the
portuguese
the
most
determined
opposition
to
the
attempt
his
ship's
company
was
numerous
and
he
had
a
small
detachment
of
soldiers
on
board
to
assist
the
supercargo
who
carried
out
many
thousand
dollars
to
make
purchases
at
ports
in
china
where
their
goods
might
not
be
appreciated
every
care
had
been
taken
in
the
equipment
of
the
vessel
which
was
perhaps
the
finest
the
best
manned
and
freighted
with
the
most
valuable
cargo
which
had
ever
been
sent
out
by
the
india
company
the
utrecht
sailed
with
a
flowing
sheet
and
was
soon
clear
the
english
channel
the
voyage
promised
to
be
auspicious
favouring
gales
bore
them
without
accident
to
within
a
few
hundred
miles
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
when
for
the
first
time
they
were
becalmed
amine
was
delighted
in
the
evenings
she
would
pace
the
deck
with
philip
then
all
was
silent
except
the
splash
of
the
wave
as
it
washed
against
the
side
of
the
vessel--all
was
in
repose
and
beauty
as
the
bright
southern
constellations
sparkled
over
their
heads
whose
destinies
can
be
in
these
stars
which
appear
not
to
those
who
inhabit
the
northern
regions
said
amine
as
she
cast
her
eyes
above
and
watched
them
in
their
brightness
and
what
does
that
falling
meteor
portend
what
causes
its
rapid
descent
from
heaven
do
you
then
put
faith
in
stars
amine
in
araby
we
do
and
why
not
they
were
not
spread
over
the
sky
to
give
light--for
what
then
to
beautify
the
world
they
have
their
uses
too
then
you
agree
with
me--they
have
their
uses
and
the
destinies
of
men
are
there
concealed
my
mother
was
one
of
those
who
could
read
them
well
alas
for
me
they
are
a
sealed
book
is
it
not
better
so
amine
better--say
better
to
grovel
on
this
earth
with
our
selfish
humbled
race
wandering
in
mystery
and
awe
and
doubt
when
we
can
communicate
with
the
intelligences
above
does
not
the
soul
leap
at
her
admission
to
confer
with
superior
powers
does
not
the
proud
heart
bound
at
the
feeling
that
its
owner
is
one
of
those
more
gifted
than
the
usual
race
of
mortals
is
it
not
a
noble
ambition
a
dangerous
one--most
dangerous
and
therefore
most
noble
they
seem
as
if
they
would
speak
to
me
look
at
you
bright
star--it
beckons
to
me
for
some
time
amine's
eyes
were
raised
aloft
she
spoke
not
and
philip
remained
at
her
side
she
walked
to
the
gangway
of
the
vessel
and
looked
down
upon
the
placid
wave
pierced
by
the
moonbeams
far
below
the
surface
and
does
your
imagination
amine
conjure
up
a
race
of
beings
gifted
to
live
beneath
that
deep
blue
wave
who
sport
amidst
the
coral
rocks
and
braid
their
hair
with
pearls
said
philip
smiling
i
know
not
but
it
appears
to
me
that
it
would
be
sweet
to
live
there
you
may
call
to
mind
your
dream
philip
i
was
then
according
to
your
description
one
of
those
same
beings
you
were
replied
philip
thoughtfully
and
yet
i
feel
as
if
water
would
reject
me
even
if
the
vessel
were
to
sink
in
what
manner
this
mortal
frame
of
mine
may
be
resolved
into
its
elements
i
know
not
but
this
i
do
feel
that
it
never
will
become
the
sport
of
or
be
tossed
by
the
mocking
waves
but
come
in
philip
dearest
it
is
late
and
the
decks
are
wet
with
dew
when
the
day
dawned
the
look-out
man
at
the
masthead
reported
that
he
perceived
something
floating
on
the
still
surface
of
the
water
on
the
beam
of
the
vessel
krantz
went
up
with
his
glass
to
examine
and
made
it
out
to
be
a
small
boat
probably
cut
adrift
from
some
vessel
as
there
was
no
appearance
of
wind
philip
permitted
a
boat
to
be
sent
to
examine
it
and
after
a
long
pull
the
seamen
returned
on
board
towing
the
small
boat
astern
there
is
a
body
of
a
man
in
it
sir
said
the
second
mate
to
krantz
as
he
gained
the
gangway
but
whether
he
is
quite
dead
or
not
i
cannot
tell
krantz
reported
this
to
philip
who
was
at
that
time
sitting
at
breakfast
with
amine
in
the
cabin
and
then
proceeded
to
the
gangway
to
where
the
body
of
the
man
had
been
already
handed
up
by
the
seamen
the
surgeon
who
had
been
summoned
declared
that
life
was
not
yet
extinct
and
was
ordering
him
to
be
taken
below
for
recovery
when
to
their
astonishment
the
man
turned
as
he
lay
sat
up
and
ultimately
rose
upon
his
feet
and
staggered
to
a
gun
when
after
a
time
he
appeared
to
be
fully
recovered
in
reply
to
questions
put
to
him
he
said
that
he
was
in
a
vessel
which
had
been
upset
in
a
squall
that
he
had
time
to
cut
away
the
small
boat
astern
and
that
all
the
rest
of
the
crew
had
perished
he
had
hardly
made
this
answer
when
philip
with
amine
came
out
of
the
cabin
and
walked
up
to
where
the
seamen
were
crowded
round
the
man
the
seamen
retreated
so
as
to
make
an
opening
when
philip
and
amine
to
their
astonishment
and
horror
recognised
their
old
acquaintance
one-eyed
pilot
schriften
he
he
captain
vanderdecken
i
believe--glad
to
see
you
in
command
and
you
too
fair
lady
philip
turned
away
with
a
chill
at
his
heart
amine's
eye
flashed
as
she
surveyed
the
wasted
form
of
the
wretched
creature
after
a
few
seconds
she
turned
round
and
followed
philip
into
the
cabin
where
she
found
him
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
courage
philip
courage
said
amine
it
was
indeed
a
heavy
shock
and
i
fear
me
forebodes
evil
but
what
then
it
is
our
destiny
it
is
it
ought
perhaps
to
be
mine
replied
philip
raising
his
head
but
you
amine
why
should
you
be
a
partner--
i
am
your
partner
philip
in
life
and
in
death
i
would
not
die
first
philip
because
it
would
grieve
you
but
your
death
will
be
the
signal
for
mine
and
i
will
join
you
quickly
surely
amine
you
would
not
hasten
your
own
yes
and
require
but
one
moment
for
this
little
steel
to
do
its
duty
nay
amine
that
is
not
lawful--our
religion
forbids
it
it
may
do
so
but
i
cannot
tell
why
i
came
into
this
world
without
my
own
consent
surely
i
may
leave
it
without
asking
the
leave
of
priests
but
let
that
pass
for
the
present
what
will
you
do
with
that
schriften
put
him
on
shore
at
the
cape--i
cannot
bear
the
odious
wretch's
presence
did
you
not
feel
the
chill
as
before
when
you
approached
him
i
did--i
knew
that
he
was
there
before
i
saw
him
but
still
i
know
not
why
i
feel
as
if
i
would
not
send
him
away
why
not
i
believe
it
is
because
i
am
inclined
to
brave
destiny
not
to
quail
at
it
the
wretch
can
do
no
harm
yes
he
can--much
he
can
render
the
ship's
company
mutinous
and
disaffected
besides
he
attempted
to
deprive
me
of
my
relic
i
almost
wish
he
had
done
so
then
must
you
have
discontinued
this
wild
search
nay
amine
say
not
so
it
is
my
duty
and
i
have
taken
my
solemn
oath--
but
this
schriften--you
cannot
well
put
him
ashore
at
the
cape
being
a
company's
officer
you
might
send
him
home
if
you
found
a
ship
there
homeward
bound
still
were
i
you
i
would
let
destiny
work
he
is
woven
in
with
ours
that
is
certain
courage
philip
and
let
him
remain
perhaps
you
are
right
amine
i
may
retard
but
cannot
escape
whatever
may
be
my
intended
fate
let
him
remain
then
and
let
him
do
his
worst
treat
him
with
kindness--who
knows
what
we
may
gain
from
him
true
true
amine
he
has
been
my
enemy
without
cause
who
can
tell--
perhaps
he
may
become
my
friend
and
if
not
you
will
have
done
your
duty
send
for
him
now
no
not
now--to-morrow
in
the
mean
time
i
will
order
him
every
comfort
we
are
talking
as
if
he
were
one
of
us
which
i
feel
that
he
is
not
replied
amine
but
still
mundane
or
not
we
cannot
but
offer
mundane
kindness
and
what
this
world
or
rather
what
this
ship
affords
i
long
now
to
talk
with
him
to
see
if
i
can
produce
any
effect
upon
his
ice-like
frame
shall
i
make
love
to
the
ghoul
and
amine
burst
into
a
bitter
laugh
here
the
conversation
dropped
but
its
substance
was
not
disregarded
the
next
morning
the
surgeon
having
reported
that
schriften
was
apparently
quite
recovered
he
was
summoned
into
the
cabin
his
frame
was
wasted
away
to
a
skeleton
but
his
motions
and
his
language
were
as
sharp
and
petulant
as
ever
i
have
sent
for
you
schriften
to
know
if
there
is
anything
that
i
can
do
to
make
you
more
comfortable
is
there
anything
that
you
want
want
replied
schriften
eyeing
first
philip
and
then
amine
he
he
i
think
i
want
filling
out
a
little
that
you
will
i
trust
in
good
time
my
steward
has
my
orders
to
take
care
of
you
poor
man
said
amine
with
a
look
of
pity
how
much
he
must
have
suffered
is
not
this
the
man
who
brought
you
the
letter
from
the
company
philip
he
he
yes
not
very
welcome
was
it
lady
no
my
good
fellow
it's
never
a
welcome
message
to
a
wife
that
sends
her
husband
away
from
her
but
that
was
not
your
fault
if
a
husband
will
go
to
sea
and
leave
a
handsome
wife
when
he
has
as
they
say
plenty
of
money
to
live
upon
on
shore
he
he
yes
indeed
you
may
well
say
that
replied
amine
better
give
it
up
all
folly
all
madness--eh
captain
i
must
finish
this
voyage
at
all
events
replied
philip
to
amine
whatever
i
may
do
afterwards
i
have
suffered
much
and
so
have
you
schriften
you
have
been
twice
wrecked
now
tell
me
what
do
you
wish
to
do
go
home
in
the
first
ship
or
go
ashore
at
the
cape
or--
or
do
anything
so
i
get
out
of
this
ship--he
he
not
so
if
you
prefer
sailing
with
me
as
i
know
you
are
a
good
seaman
you
shall
have
your
rating
and
pay
of
pilot--that
is
if
you
choose
to
follow
my
fortunes
follow--must
follow
yes
i'll
sail
with
you
mynheer
vanderdecken
i
wish
to
be
always
near
you--he
he
be
it
so
then
as
soon
as
you
are
strong
again
you
will
go
to
your
duty
till
then
i
will
see
that
you
want
for
nothing
nor
i
my
good
fellow
come
to
me
if
you
do
and
i
will
be
your
help
said
amine
you
have
suffered
much
but
we
will
do
what
we
can
to
make
you
forget
it
very
good--very
kind
replied
schriften
surveying
the
lovely
face
and
figure
of
amine
after
a
times
shrugging
up
his
shoulders
he
added--a
pity
yes
it
is
must
be
though
farewell
continued
amine
holding
out
her
hand
to
schriften
the
man
took
it
and
a
cold
shudder
went
to
her
heart
but
she
expecting
such
a
result
would
not
appear
to
feel
it
schriften
held
her
hand
for
a
second
or
two
in
his
own
looking
at
it
earnestly
and
then
at
amine's
face
so
fair--so
good
mynheer
vanderdecken
i
thank
you
lady
may
heaven
preserve
you
then
squeezing
the
hand
of
amine
which
he
had
not
released
schriften
hastened
out
of
the
cabin
so
great
was
the
sudden
icy
shock
which
passed
through
amine's
frame
when
schriften
pressed
her
hand
that
when
with
difficulty
she
gained
the
sofa
she
fell
upon
it
after
remaining
with
her
hand
pressed
against
her
heart
for
some
time
during
which
philip
bent
over
her
she
said
in
a
breathless
voice
that
creature
must
be
supernatural--i
am
sure
of
it--i
am
now
convinced
well
continued
she
after
a
pause
of
some
little
while
all
the
better
if
we
can
make
him
a
friend
and
if
i
can
i
will
but
think
you
amine
that
those
who
are
not
of
this
world
have
feelings
of
kindness
gratitude
and
ill-will
as
we
have
can
they
be
made
subservient
most
surely
so
if
they
have
ill-will--as
we
know
they
have--they
must
also
be
endowed
with
the
better
feelings
why
are
there
good
and
evil
intelligences
they
may
have
disencumbered
themselves
of
their
mortal
clay
but
the
soul
must
be
the
same
a
soul
without
feeling
were
no
soul
at
all
the
soul
is
active
in
this
world
and
must
be
so
in
the
next
if
angels
can
pity
they
must
feel
like
us
if
demons
can
vex
they
must
feel
like
us
our
feelings
change
then
why
not
theirs
without
feelings
there
were
no
heaven
no
hell
here
our
souls
are
confined
cribbed
and
overladen--borne
down
by
the
heavy
flesh
by
which
they
are
for
the
time
polluted
but
the
soul
that
has
winged
its
flight
from
clay
is
i
think
not
one
jot
more
pure
more
bright
or
more
perfect
than
those
within
ourselves
can
they
be
made
subservient
say
you
yes
they
can
they
can
be
forced
when
mortals
possess
the
means
and
power
the
evil-inclined
may
be
forced
to
good
as
well
as
to
evil
it
is
not
the
good
and
perfect
spirits
that
we
subject
by
art
but
those
that
are
inclined
to
wrong
it
is
over
them
that
mortals
have
the
power
our
arts
have
no
power
over
the
perfect
spirits
but
over
those
which
are
ever
working
evil
and
which
are
bound
to
obey
and
do
good
if
those
who
master
them
require
it
you
still
resort
to
forbidden
arts
amine
is
that
right
right
if
we
have
power
given
to
us
it
is
right
to
use
it
yes
most
certainly
for
good
but
not
for
evil
mortals
in
power
possessing
nothing
but
what
is
mundane
are
answerable
for
the
use
of
that
power
so
those
gifted
by
superior
means
are
answerable
as
they
employ
those
means
does
the
god
above
make
a
flower
to
grow
intending
that
it
should
not
be
gathered
no
neither
does
he
allow
supernatural
aid
to
be
given
if
he
did
not
intend
that
mortals
should
avail
themselves
of
it
as
amine's
eyes
beamed
upon
philip's
he
could
not
for
the
moment
subdue
the
idea
rising
in
his
mind
that
she
was
not
like
other
mortals
and
he
calmly
observed
am
i
sure
amine
that
i
am
wedded
to
one
mortal
as
myself
yes
yes
philip
compose
yourself
i
am
but
mortal
would
to
heaven
i
were
not
would
to
heaven
i
were
one
of
those
who
could
hover
over
you
watch
you
in
all
your
perils
save
and
protect
you
in
this
your
mad
career
but
i
am
but
a
poor
weak
woman
whose
heart
beats
fondly
devotedly
for
you--who
for
you
would
dare
all
and
everything--who
changed
in
her
nature
has
become
courageous
and
daring
from
her
love--
and
who
rejects
all
creeds
which
would
prevent
her
from
calling
upon
heaven
or
earth
or
hell
to
assist
her
in
retaining
with
her
her
soul's
existence
nay
nay
amine--say
not
you
reject
the
creed
does
not
this--and
philip
pulled
from
his
bosom
the
holy
relic--does
not
this
and
the
message
sent
by
it
prove
our
creed
is
true
i
have
thought
much
of
it
philip
at
first
it
startled
me
almost
into
a
belief
but
even
your
own
priests
helped
to
undeceive
me
they
would
not
answer
you
they
would
have
left
you
to
guide
yourself
the
message
and
the
holy
word
and
the
wonderful
signs
given
were
not
in
unison
with
their
creed
and
they
halted
may
i
not
halt
if
they
did
the
relic
may
be
as
mystic
as
powerful
as
you
describe
but
the
agencies
may
be
false
and
wicked--the
power
given
to
it
may
have
fallen
into
wrong
hands
the
power
remains
the
same
but
it
is
applied
to
uses
not
intended
the
power
amine
can
only
be
exercised
by
those
who
are
friends
to
him
who
died
upon
it
then
is
it
no
power
at
all
or
if
a
power
not
half
so
great
as
that
of
the
arch-fiend
for
his
can
work
for
good
and
evil
both
but
on
this
point
dear
philip
we
do
not
well
agree
nor
can
we
convince
each
other
you
have
been
taught
in
one
way
i
another
that
which
our
childhood
has
imbibed--which
has
grown
up
with
our
growth
and
strengthened
with
our
years--is
not
to
be
eradicated
i
have
seen
my
mother
work
great
charms
and
succeed
you
have
knelt
to
priests
i
blame
not
you--blame
not
then
your
amine
we
both
mean
well--i
trust
do
well
if
a
life
of
innocence
and
purity
were
all
that
were
required
my
amine
would
be
sure
of
future
bliss
i
think
it
is
and
thinking
so
it
is
my
creed
there
are
many
creeds
who
shall
say
which
is
the
true
one
and
what
matters
it--they
all
have
the
same
end
in
view--a
future
heaven
true
amine
true
replied
philip
pacing
the
cabin
thoughtfully
and
yet
our
priests
say
otherwise
what
is
the
basis
of
their
creed
philip
charity
and
good-will
does
charity
condemn
to
eternal
misery
those
who
have
never
heard
this
creed--who
have
lived
and
died
worshipping
the
great
being
after
their
best
endeavours
and
little
knowledge
no
surely
amine
made
no
further
observations
and
philip
after
pacing
for
a
few
minutes
in
deep
thought
walked
out
of
the
cabin
the
utrecht
arrived
at
the
cape
watered
and
proceeded
on
her
voyage
and
after
two
months
of
difficult
navigation
cast
anchor
off
gambroon
during
this
time
amine
had
been
unceasing
in
her
attempts
to
gain
the
good-will
of
schriften
she
had
often
conversed
with
him
on
deck
and
had
done
him
every
kindness
and
had
overcome
that
fear
which
his
near
approach
had
generally
occasioned
schriften
gradually
appeared
mindful
of
this
kindness
and
at
last
to
be
pleased
with
amine's
company
to
philip
he
was
at
times
civil
and
courteous
but
not
always
but
to
amine
he
was
always
deferent
his
language
was
mystical--she
could
not
prevent
his
chuckling
laugh
his
occasional
he
he
from
breaking
forth
but
when
they
anchored
at
gambroon
he
was
on
such
terms
with
her
that
he
would
occasionally
come
into
the
cabin
and
although
he
would
not
sit
down
would
talk
to
amine
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
depart
while
the
vessel
lay
at
anchor
at
gambroon
schriften
one
evening
walked
up
to
amine
who
was
sitting
on
the
poop
lady
said
he
after
a
pause
yon
ship
sails
for
your
own
country
in
a
few
days
so
i
am
told
replied
amine
will
you
take
the
advice
of
one
who
wishes
you
well
return
in
that
vessel--go
back
to
your
own
cottage
and
stay
there
till
your
husband
comes
to
you
once
more
why
is
this
advice
given
because
i
forebode
danger--nay
perhaps
death
a
cruel
death--to
one
i
would
not
harm
to
me
replied
amine
fixing
her
eyes
upon
schriften
and
meeting
his
piercing
gaze
yes
to
you
some
people
can
see
into
futurity
further
than
others
not
if
they
are
mortal
replied
amine
yes
if
they
are
mortal
but
mortal
or
not
i
do
see
that
which
i
would
avert
tempt
not
destiny
further
who
can
avert
it
if
i
take
your
counsel
still
was
it
my
destiny
to
take
your
counsel
if
i
take
it
not
still
it
was
my
destiny
well
then
avoid
what
threatens
you
i
fear
not
yet
do
i
thank
you
tell
me
schriften
hast
thou
not
thy
fate
some
way
interwoven
with
that
of
my
husband
i
feel
that
thou
hast
why
think
you
so
lady
for
many
reasons
twice
you
have
summoned
him--twice
have
you
been
wrecked
and
miraculously
reappeared
and
recovered
you
know
too
of
his
mission--that
is
evident
but
proves
nothing
yes
it
proves
much
for
it
proves
that
you
knew
what
was
supposed
to
be
known
but
to
him
alone
it
was
known
to
you
and
holy
men
debated
on
it
replied
schriften
with
a
sneer
how
knew
you
that
again
he
he
replied
schriften
forgive
me
lady
i
meant
not
to
affront
you
you
cannot
deny
that
you
are
connected
mysteriously
and
incomprehensibly
with
this
mission
of
my
husband's
tell
me
is
it
as
he
believes
true
and
holy
if
he
thinks
that
it
is
true
and
holy
it
becomes
so
why
then
do
you
appear
his
enemy
i
am
not
his
enemy
fair
lady
you
are
not
his
enemy--why
then
did
you
once
attempt
to
deprive
him
of
the
mystic
relic
by
which
the
mission
is
to
be
accomplished
i
would
prevent
his
further
search
for
reasons
which
must
not
be
told
does
that
prove
that
i
am
his
enemy
would
it
not
be
better
that
he
should
remain
on
shore
with
competence
and
you
than
be
crossing
the
wild
seas
on
this
mad
search
without
the
relic
it
is
not
to
be
accomplished
it
were
a
kindness
then
to
take
it
from
him
amine
answered
not
for
she
was
lost
in
thought
lady
continued
schriften
after
a
time
i
wish
you
well
for
your
husband
i
care
not
yet
do
i
wish
him
no
harm
now
hear
me
if
you
wish
for
your
future
life
to
be
one
of
ease
and
peace--if
you
wish
to
remain
long
in
this
world
with
the
husband
of
your
choice
of
your
first
and
warmest
love--if
you
wish
that
he
should
die
in
his
bed
at
a
good
old
age
and
that
you
should
close
his
eyes
with
children's
tears
lamenting
and
their
smiles
reserved
to
cheer
their
mother--all
this
i
see
and
can
promise
is
in
futurity
if
you
will
take
that
relic
from
his
bosom
and
give
it
up
to
me
but
if
you
would
that
he
should
suffer
more
than
man
has
ever
suffered
pass
his
whole
life
in
doubt
anxiety
and
pain
until
the
deep
wave
receive
his
corpse
then
let
him
keep
it
if
you
would
that
your
own
days
be
shortened
and
yet
those
remaining
be
long
in
human
suffering--if
you
would
be
separated
from
him
and
die
a
cruel
death--then
let
him
keep
it
i
can
read
futurity
and
such
must
be
the
destiny
of
both
lady
consider
well
i
must
leave
you
now
to-morrow
i
will
have
your
answer
schriften
walked
away
and
left
amine
to
her
own
reflections
for
a
long
while
she
repeated
to
herself
the
conversation
and
denunciations
of
the
man
whom
she
was
now
convinced
was
not
of
this
world
and
was
in
some
way
or
another
deeply
connected
with
her
husband's
fate
to
me
he
wishes
well
no
harm
to
my
husband
and
would
prevent
his
search
why
would
he--that
he
will
not
tell
he
has
tempted
me
tempted
me
most
strangely
how
easy
'twere
to
take
the
relic
whilst
philip
sleeps
upon
my
bosom--but
how
treacherous
and
yet
a
life
of
competence
and
ease
a
smiling
family
a
good
old
age
what
offers
to
a
fond
and
doting
wife
and
if
not
toil
anxiety
and
a
watery
grave
and
for
me
pshaw
that's
nothing
and
yet
to
die
separated
from
philip
is
that
nothing
oh
no
the
thought
is
dreadful--i
do
believe
him
yes
he
has
foretold
the
future
and
told
it
truly
could
i
persuade
philip
no
i
know
him
well
he
has
vowed
and
is
not
to
be
changed
and
yet
if
the
relic
were
taken
without
his
knowledge
he
would
not
have
to
blame
himself
who
then
would
he
blame
could
i
deceive
him
i
the
wife
of
his
bosom
tell
a
lie
no
no
it
must
not
be
come
what
will
it
is
our
destiny
and
i
am
resigned
i
would
that
schriften
had
not
spoken
alas
we
search
into
futurity
and
then
would
fain
retrace
our
steps
and
wish
we
had
remained
in
ignorance
what
makes
you
so
pensive
amine
said
philip
who
some
time
afterwards
walked
up
to
where
she
was
seated
amine
replied
not
at
first
shall
i
tell
him
all
thought
she
it
is
my
only
chance--i
will
amine
repeated
the
conversation
between
her
and
schriften
philip
made
no
reply
he
sat
down
by
amine
and
took
her
hand
amine
dropped
her
head
upon
her
husband's
shoulder
what
think
you
amine
said
philip
after
a
time
i
could
not
steal
your
relic
philip
perhaps
you'll
give
it
to
me
and
my
father
amine
my
poor
father--his
dreadful
doom
to
be
eternal
he
who
appealed
was
permitted
to
appeal
to
his
son
that
that
dreadful
doom
might
be
averted
does
not
the
conversation
of
this
man
prove
to
you
that
my
mission
is
not
false
does
not
his
knowledge
of
it
strengthen
all
yet
why
would
he
prevent
it
continued
philip
musing
why
i
cannot
tell
philip
but
i
would
fain
prevent
it
i
feel
that
he
has
power
to
read
the
future
and
has
read
aright
be
it
so
he
has
spoken
but
not
plainly
he
has
promised
me
what
i
have
long
been
prepared
for--what
i
vowed
to
heaven
to
suffer
already
have
i
suffered
much
and
am
prepared
to
suffer
more
i
have
long
looked
upon
this
world
as
a
pilgrimage
and
selected
as
i
have
been
trust
that
my
reward
will
be
in
the
other
but
amine
you
are
not
bound
by
oath
to
heaven
you
have
made
no
compact
he
advised
you
to
go
home
he
talked
of
a
cruel
death
follow
his
advice
and
avoid
it
i
am
not
bound
by
oath
philip
but
hear
me
as
i
hope
for
future
bliss
i
now
bind
myself
hold
amine
nay
philip
you
cannot
prevent
me
for
if
you
do
now
i
will
repeat
it
when
you
are
absent
a
cruel
death
were
a
charity
to
me
for
i
shall
not
see
you
suffer
then
may
i
never
expect
future
bliss
may
eternal
misery
be
my
portion
if
i
leave
you
as
long
as
fate
permits
us
to
be
together
i
am
yours--your
wife
my
fortunes
my
present
my
future
my
all
are
embarked
with
you
and
destiny
may
do
its
worst
for
amine
will
not
quail
i
have
no
recreant
heart
to
turn
aside
from
danger
or
from
suffering
in
that
one
point
philip
at
least
you
chose
you
wedded
well
philip
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
in
silence
and
the
conversation
was
not
resumed
the
next
evening
schriften
came
up
again
to
amine
well
lady
said
he
schriften
it
cannot
be
replied
amine
yet
do
i
thank
you
much
lady
if
he
must
follow
up
his
mission
why
should
you
schriften
i
am
his
wife--as
for
ever
in
this
world
and
the
next
you
cannot
blame
me
no
replied
schriften
i
do
not
blame
i
admire
you
i
feel
sorry
but
after
all
what
is
death
nothing
he
he
and
schriften
hastened
away
and
left
amine
to
herself
the
utrecht
sailed
from
gambroon
touched
at
ceylon
and
proceeded
on
her
voyage
in
the
eastern
seas
schriften
still
remained
on
board
but
since
his
last
conversation
with
amine
he
had
kept
aloof
and
appeared
to
avoid
both
her
and
philip
still
there
was
not
as
before
any
attempt
to
make
the
ship's
company
disaffected
nor
did
he
indulge
in
his
usual
taunts
and
sneers
the
communication
he
had
made
to
amine
had
also
its
effect
upon
her
and
philip
they
were
more
pensive
and
thoughtful
each
attempted
to
conceal
their
gloom
from
the
other
and
when
they
embraced
it
was
with
the
mournful
feeling
that
perhaps
it
was
an
indulgence
they
would
soon
be
deprived
of
at
the
same
time
they
steeled
their
hearts
to
endurance
and
prepared
to
meet
the
worst
krantz
wondered
at
the
change
but
of
course
could
not
account
for
it
the
utrecht
was
not
far
from
the
andaman
isles
when
krantz
who
had
watched
the
barometer
came
in
early
one
morning
and
called
philip
we
have
every
prospect
of
a
typhoon
sir
said
krantz
the
glass
and
the
weather
are
both
threatening
then
we
must
make
all
snug
send
down
top-gallant
yards
and
small
sails
directly
we
will
strike
top-gallant
masts
i
will
be
out
in
a
minute
philip
hastened
on
deck
the
sea
was
smooth
but
already
the
moaning
of
the
wind
gave
notice
of
the
approaching
storm
the
vacuum
in
the
air
was
about
to
be
filled
up
and
the
convulsion
would
be
terrible
a
white
haze
gathered
fast
thicker
and
thicker
the
men
were
turned
up
everything
of
weight
was
sent
below
and
the
guns
were
secured
now
came
a
blast
of
wind
which
careened
the
ship
passed
over
and
in
a
minute
she
righted
as
before
then
another
and
another
fiercer
and
fiercer
still
the
sea
although
smooth
at
last
appeared
white
as
a
sheet
with
foam
as
the
typhoon
swept
along
in
its
impetuous
career
it
burst
upon
the
vessel
which
bowed
down
to
her
gunnel
and
there
remained
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
hurricane
had
passed
over
and
the
vessel
was
relieved
but
the
sea
had
risen
and
the
wind
was
strong
in
another
hour
the
blast
again
came
more
wild
more
furious
than
the
first
the
waves
were
dashed
into
their
faces
torrents
of
rain
descended
the
ship
was
thrown
on
her
beam
ends
and
thus
remained
till
the
wild
blast
had
passed
away
to
sweep
destruction
far
beyond
them
leaving
behind
it
a
tumultuous
angry
sea
it
is
nearly
over
i
believe
sir
said
krantz
it
is
clearing
up
a
little
to
windward
we
have
had
the
worst
of
it
i
believe
said
philip
no
there
is
worse
to
come
said
a
low
voice
near
to
philip
it
was
schriften
who
spoke
a
vessel
to
windward
scudding
before
the
gale
cried
krantz
philip
looked
to
windward
and
in
the
spot
where
the
horizon
was
clearest
he
saw
a
vessel
under
topsails
and
foresail
standing
right
down
she
is
a
large
vessel
bring
me
my
glass
the
telescope
was
brought
from
the
cabin
but
before
philip
could
use
it
a
haze
had
again
gathered
up
to
windward
and
the
vessel
was
not
to
be
seen
thick
again
observed
philip
as
he
shut
in
his
telescope
we
must
look
out
for
that
vessel
that
she
does
not
run
too
close
to
us
she
has
seen
us
no
doubt
sir
said
krantz
after
a
few
minutes
the
typhoon
again
raged
and
the
atmosphere
was
of
a
murky
gloom
it
seemed
as
if
some
heavy
fog
had
been
hurled
along
by
the
furious
wind
nothing
was
to
be
distinguished
except
the
white
foam
of
the
sea
and
that
not
the
distance
of
half
a
cable's
length
where
it
was
lost
in
one
dark
grey
mist
the
storm-stay-sail
yielding
to
the
force
of
the
wind
was
rent
into
strips
and
flogged
and
cracked
with
a
noise
even
louder
than
the
gale
the
furious
blast
again
blew
over
and
the
mist
cleared
up
a
little
ship
on
the
weather
beam
close
aboard
of
us
cried
one
of
the
men
krantz
and
philip
sprang
upon
the
gunwale
and
beheld
the
large
ship
bearing
right
down
upon
them
not
three
cables'
length
distant
helm
up
she
does
not
see
us
and
she
will
be
aboard
of
us
cried
philip
helm
up
i
say
hard
up
quick
the
helm
was
put
up
as
the
men
perceiving
their
imminent
danger
climbed
upon
the
guns
to
look
if
the
vessel
altered
her
course
but
no--
down
she
came
and
the
head-sails
of
the
utrecht
having
been
carried
away
to
their
horror
they
perceived
that
she
would
not
answer
her
helm
and
pay
off
as
they
required
ship
ahoy
roared
philip
through
his
trumpet--but
the
gale
drove
the
sound
back
ship
ahoy
cried
krantz
on
the
gunwale
waving
his
hat
it
was
useless--down
she
came
with
the
waters
foaming
under
her
bows
and
was
now
within
pistol-shot
of
the
utrecht
ship
ahoy
roared
all
the
sailors
with
a
shout
that
must
have
been
heard
it
was
not
attended
to
down
came
the
vessel
upon
them
and
now
her
cutwater
was
within
ten
yards
of
the
utrecht
the
men
of
the
utrecht
who
expected
that
their
vessel
would
be
severed
in
half
by
the
concussion
climbed
upon
the
weather
gunwale
all
ready
to
catch
at
the
ropes
of
the
other
vessel
and
climb
on
board
of
her
amine
who
had
been
surprised
at
the
noise
on
deck
had
come
out
and
had
taken
philip
by
the
arm
trust
to
me--the
shock--
said
philip
he
said
no
more
the
cutwater
of
the
stranger
touched
their
sides
one
general
cry
was
raised
by
the
sailors
of
the
utrecht--they
sprang
to
catch
at
the
rigging
of
the
other
vessel's
bowsprit
which
was
now
pointed
between
their
masts--they
caught
at
nothing--nothing--there
was
no
shock--no
concussion
of
the
two
vessels--the
stranger
appeared
to
cleave
through
them--her
hull
passed
along
in
silence--no
cracking
of
timbers--no
falling
of
masts--the
foreyard
passed
through
their
mainsail
yet
the
canvas
was
unrent--the
whole
vessel
appeared
to
cut
through
the
utrecht
yet
left
no
trace
of
injury--not
fast
but
slowly
as
if
she
were
really
sawing
through
her
by
the
heaving
and
tossing
of
the
sea
with
her
sharp
prow
the
stranger's
forechains
had
passed
their
gunwale
before
philip
could
recover
himself
amine
cried
he
at
last
the
phantom
ship--my
father
the
seamen
of
the
utrecht
more
astounded
by
the
marvellous
result
than
by
their
former
danger
threw
themselves
down
upon
deck
some
hastened
below
some
prayed
others
were
dumb
with
astonishment
and
fear
amine
appeared
more
calm
than
any
not
excepting
philip
she
surveyed
the
vessel
as
it
slowly
forced
its
way
through
she
beheld
the
seamen
on
board
of
her
coolly
leaning
over
the
gunwale
as
if
deriding
the
destruction
they
had
occasioned
she
looked
for
vanderdecken
himself
and
on
the
poop
of
the
vessel
with
his
trumpet
under
his
arm
she
beheld
the
image
of
her
philip--the
same
hardy
strong
build--the
same
features--about
the
same
age
apparently--there
could
be
no
doubt
it
was
the
doomed
vanderdecken
see
philip
said
she
see
your
father
even
so--merciful
heaven
it
is--it
is
and
philip
overpowered
by
his
feelings
sank
upon
deck
the
vessel
had
now
passed
over
the
utrecht
the
form
of
the
elder
vanderdecken
was
seen
to
walk
aft
and
look
over
the
taffrail
amine
perceived
it
to
start
and
turn
away
suddenly--she
looked
down
and
saw
schriften
shaking
his
fist
in
defiance
at
the
supernatural
being
again
the
phantom
ship
flew
to
leeward
before
the
gale
and
was
soon
lost
in
the
mist
but
before
that
amine
had
turned
and
perceived
the
situation
of
philip
no
one
but
herself
and
schriften
appeared
able
to
act
or
move
she
caught
the
pilot's
eye
beckoned
to
him
and
with
his
assistance
philip
was
led
into
the
cabin
i
have
then
seen
him
said
philip
after
he
had
lain
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
cabin
for
some
minutes
to
recover
himself
while
amine
bent
over
him
i
have
at
last
seen
him
amine
can
you
doubt
now
no
philip
i
have
now
no
doubt
replied
amine
mournfully
but
take
courage
philip
for
myself
i
want
not
courage--but
for
you
amine--you
know
that
his
appearance
portends
a
mischief
that
will
surely
come
let
it
come
replied
amine
calmly
i
have
long
been
prepared
for
it
and
so
have
you
yes
for
my
self
but
not
for
you
you
have
been
wrecked
often
and
have
been
saved--then
why
should
not
i
but
the
sufferings
those
suffer
least
who
have
most
courage
to
bear
up
against
them
i
am
but
a
woman
weak
and
frail
in
body
but
i
trust
i
have
that
within
me
which
will
not
make
you
feel
ashamed
of
amine
no
philip
you
will
have
no
wailing
no
expression
of
despair
from
amine's
lips
if
she
can
console
you
she
will
if
she
can
assist
you
she
will
but
come
what
may
if
she
cannot
serve
you
at
least
she
will
prove
no
burden
to
you
your
presence
in
misfortune
would
unnerve
me
amine
it
shall
not
it
shall
add
to
your
resolution
let
fate
do
its
worst
depend
upon
it
amine
that
will
be
ere
long
be
it
so
replied
amine
but
philip
it
were
as
well
you
showed
yourself
on
deck
the
men
are
frightened
and
your
absence
will
be
observed
you
are
right
said
philip
and
rising
and
embracing
her
he
left
the
cabin
it
is
but
too
true
then
thought
amine
now
to
prepare
for
disaster
and
death
the
warning
has
come
i
would
i
could
know
more
oh
mother
mother
look
down
upon
thy
child
and
in
a
dream
reveal
the
mystic
arts
which
i
have
forgotten--then
should
i
know
more
but
i
have
promised
philip
that
unless
separated--yes
that
idea
is
worse
than
death
and
i
have
a
sad
foreboding
my
courage
fails
me
only
when
i
think
of
that
philip
on
his
return
to
the
deck
found
the
crew
of
the
vessel
in
great
consternation
krantz
himself
appeared
bewildered--he
had
not
forgotten
the
appearance
of
the
phantom
ship
off
desolation
harbour
and
the
vessels
following
her
their
destruction
this
second
appearance
more
awful
than
the
former
quite
unmanned
him
and
when
philip
came
out
of
the
cabin
he
was
leaning
in
gloomy
silence
against
the
weather-bulkhead
we
shall
never
reach
port
again
sir
said
he
to
philip
as
he
came
up
to
him
silence
silence
the
men
may
hear
you
it
matters
not
they
think
the
same
replied
krantz
but
they
are
wrong
replied
philip
turning
to
the
seamen
my
lads
that
some
disaster
may
happen
to
us
after
the
appearance
of
this
vessel
is
most
probable
i
have
seen
her
before
more
than
once
and
disasters
did
then
happen
but
here
i
am
alive
and
well
therefore
it
does
not
prove
that
we
cannot
escape
as
i
have
before
done
we
must
do
our
best
and
trust
in
heaven
the
gale
is
breaking
fast
and
in
a
few
hours
we
shall
have
fine
weather
i
have
met
this
phantom
ship
before
and
care
not
how
often
i
meet
it
again
mr
krantz
get
up
the
spirits--the
men
have
had
hard
work
and
must
be
fatigued
the
very
prospect
of
obtaining
liquor
appeared
to
give
courage
to
the
men
they
hastened
to
obey
the
order
and
the
quantity
served
out
was
sufficient
to
give
courage
to
the
most
tearful
and
induce
others
to
defy
old
vanderdecken
and
his
whole
crew
of
imps
the
next
morning
the
weather
was
fine
the
sea
smooth
and
the
utrecht
went
gaily
on
her
voyage
many
days
of
gentle
breezes
and
favouring
winds
gradually
wore
off
the
panic
occasioned
by
the
supernatural
appearance
and
if
not
forgotten
it
was
referred
to
either
in
jest
or
with
indifference
he
now
had
run
through
the
straits
of
malacca
and
entered
the
polynesian
archipelago
philip's
orders
were
to
refresh
and
call
for
instructions
at
the
small
island
of
boton
then
in
possession
of
the
dutch
they
arrived
there
in
safety
and
after
remaining
two
days
again
sailed
on
their
voyage
intending
to
make
their
passage
between
the
celebes
and
the
island
of
galago
the
weather
was
still
clear
and
the
wind
light
they
proceeded
cautiously
on
account
of
the
reefs
and
currents
and
with
a
careful
watch
for
the
piratical
vessels
which
have
for
centuries
infested
those
seas
but
they
were
not
molested
and
had
gained
well
up
among
the
islands
to
the
north
of
galago
when
it
fell
calm
and
the
vessel
was
borne
to
the
eastward
of
it
by
the
current
the
calm
lasted
several
days
and
they
could
procure
no
anchorage
at
last
they
found
themselves
among
the
cluster
of
islands
near
to
the
northern
coast
of
new
guinea
the
anchor
was
dropped
and
the
sails
furled
for
the
night
a
drizzling
small
rain
came
on
the
weather
was
thick
and
watches
were
stationed
in
every
part
of
the
ship
that
they
might
not
be
surprised
by
the
pirate
proas
for
the
current
ran
past
the
ship
at
the
rate
of
eight
or
nine
miles
per
hour
and
these
vessels
if
hid
among
the
islands
might
sweep
down
upon
them
unperceived
it
was
twelve
o'clock
at
night
when
philip
who
was
in
bed
was
awakened
by
a
shock
he
thought
it
might
be
a
proa
running
alongside
and
he
started
from
his
bed
and
ran
out
he
found
krantz
who
had
been
awakened
by
the
same
cause
running
up
undressed
another
shock
succeeded
and
the
ship
careened
to
port
philip
then
knew
that
the
ship
was
on
shore
the
thickness
of
the
night
prevented
them
from
ascertaining
where
the
were
but
the
lead
was
thrown
over
the
side
and
they
found
that
they
were
lying
on
shore
on
a
sandbank
with
not
more
than
fourteen
feet
water
on
the
deepest
side
and
that
they
were
broadside
on
with
a
strong
current
pressing
them
further
up
on
the
bank
indeed
the
current
ran
like
a
mill-race
and
each
minute
they
were
swept
into
shallow
water
on
examination
they
found
that
the
ship
had
dragged
her
anchor
which
with
the
cable
was
still
taut
from
the
starboard
bow
but
this
did
not
appear
to
prevent
the
vessel
from
being
swept
further
up
on
the
bank
it
was
supposed
that
the
anchor
had
parted
at
the
shank
and
another
anchor
was
let
go
nothing
more
could
be
done
till
daybreak
and
impatiently
did
they
wait
till
the
next
morning
as
the
sun
rose
the
mist
cleared
away
and
they
discovered
that
they
were
on
shore
on
a
sandbank
a
small
portion
of
which
was
above
water
and
round
which
the
current
ran
with
great
impetuosity
about
three
miles
from
them
was
a
cluster
of
small
islands
with
cocoa-trees
growing
on
them
but
with
no
appearance
of
inhabitants
i
fear
we
have
little
chance
observed
krantz
to
philip
if
we
lighten
the
vessel
the
anchor
may
not
hold
and
we
shall
be
swept
further
on
and
it
is
impossible
to
lay
out
an
anchor
against
the
force
of
this
current
at
all
events
we
must
try
but
i
grant
that
our
situation
is
anything
but
satisfactory
send
all
the
hands
aft
the
men
came
aft
gloomy
and
dispirited
my
lads
said
philip
why
are
you
disheartened
we
are
doomed
sir
we
knew
it
would
be
so
i
thought
it
probable
that
the
ship
would
be
lost--i
told
you
so
but
the
loss
of
the
ship
does
not
involve
that
of
the
ship's
company--nay
it
does
not
follow
that
the
ship
is
to
be
lost
although
she
may
be
in
great
difficulty
as
she
is
at
present
what
fear
is
there
for
us
my
men--the
water
is
smooth--we
have
plenty
of
time
before
us--we
can
make
a
raft
and
take
to
our
boats--it
never
blows
among
these
islands
and
we
have
land
close
under
our
lee
let
us
first
try
what
we
can
do
with
the
ship
if
we
fail
we
must
then
take
care
of
ourselves
the
men
caught
at
the
idea
and
went
to
work
willingly
the
water-casks
were
started
the
pumps
set
going
and
everything
that
could
be
spared
was
thrown
over
to
lighten
the
ship
but
the
anchor
still
dragged
from
the
strength
of
the
current
and
bad
holding-ground
and
philip
and
krantz
perceived
that
they
were
swept
further
on
the
bank
night
came
on
before
they
quitted
their
toil
and
then
a
fresh
breeze
sprung
up
and
created
a
swell
which
occasioned
the
vessel
to
heat
on
the
hard
sand
thus
did
they
continue
until
the
next
morning
at
daylight
the
men
resumed
their
labours
and
the
pumps
were
again
manned
to
clear
the
vessel
of
the
water
which
had
been
started
but
after
a
time
they
pumped
up
sand
this
told
them
that
a
plank
had
started
and
that
their
labours
were
useless
the
men
left
their
work
but
philip
again
encouraged
them
and
pointed
out
that
they
could
easily
save
themselves
and
all
that
they
had
to
do
was
to
construct
a
raft
which
would
hold
provisions
for
them
and
receive
that
portion
of
the
crew
who
could
not
be
taken
into
the
boats
after
some
repose
the
men
again
set
to
work
the
top-sails
were
struck
the
yards
lowered
down
and
the
raft
was
commenced
under
the
lee
of
the
vessel
where
the
strong
current
was
checked
philip
recollecting
his
former
disaster
took
great
pains
in
the
construction
of
this
raft
and
aware
that
as
the
water
and
provisions
were
expended
there
would
be
no
occasion
to
tow
so
heavy
a
mass
he
constructed
it
in
two
parts
which
might
easily
be
severed
and
thus
the
boats
would
have
less
to
tow
as
soon
as
circumstances
would
enable
them
to
part
with
one
of
them
night
again
terminated
their
labours
and
the
men
retired
to
rest
the
weather
continuing
fine
with
very
little
wind
by
noon
the
next
day
the
raft
was
complete
water
and
provisions
were
safely
stowed
on
board
a
secure
and
dry
place
was
fitted
up
for
amine
in
the
centre
of
one
portion
spare
robes
sails
and
everything
which
could
prove
useful
in
case
of
their
being
forced
on
shore
were
put
in
muskets
and
ammunition
were
also
provided
and
everything
was
ready
when
the
men
came
aft
and
pointed
out
to
philip
that
there
was
plenty
of
money
on
board
which
it
was
folly
to
leave
and
that
they
wished
to
carry
as
much
as
they
could
away
with
them
as
this
intimation
was
given
in
a
way
that
made
it
evident
they
intended
that
it
should
be
complied
with
philip
did
not
refuse
but
resolved
in
his
own
mind
that
when
they
arrived
at
a
place
where
he
could
exercise
his
authority
the
money
should
be
reclaimed
for
the
company
to
whom
it
belonged
the
men
went
down
below
and
while
philip
was
making
arrangements
with
amine
handed
the
casks
of
dollars
out
of
the
hold
broke
them
open
and
helped
themselves--quarrelling
with
each
other
for
the
first
possession
as
each
cask
was
opened
at
last
every
man
had
obtained
as
much
as
he
could
carry
and
had
placed
his
spoil
on
the
raft
with
his
baggage
or
in
the
boat
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
all
was
now
ready--amine
was
lowered
down
and
took
her
station--the
boats
took
in
tow
the
raft
which
was
cast
off
from
the
vessel
and
away
they
went
with
the
current
pulling
with
all
their
strength
to
avoid
being
stranded
upon
that
part
of
the
sandbank
which
appeared
above
water
this
was
the
great
danger
which
they
had
to
encounter
and
which
they
very
narrowly
escaped
they
numbered
eighty-six
souls
in
all
in
the
boats
there
were
thirty-two
the
rest
were
on
the
raft
which
being
well-built
and
full
of
timber
floated
high
out
of
the
water
now
that
the
sea
was
so
smooth
it
had
been
agreed
upon
by
philip
and
krantz
that
one
of
them
should
remain
on
the
raft
and
the
other
in
one
of
the
boats
but
at
the
time
the
raft
quitted
the
ship
they
were
both
on
the
raft
as
they
wished
to
consult
as
soon
as
they
discovered
the
direction
of
the
current
which
would
be
the
most
advisable
course
for
them
to
pursue
it
appeared
that
as
soon
as
the
current
had
passed
the
bank
it
took
a
more
southerly
direction
towards
new
guinea
it
was
then
debated
between
them
whether
they
should
or
should
not
land
on
that
island
the
natives
of
which
were
known
to
be
pusillanimous
yet
treacherous
a
long
debate
ensued
which
ended
however
in
their
resolve
not
to
decide
as
yet
but
wait
and
see
what
might
occur
in
the
mean
time
the
boats
pulled
to
the
westward
while
the
current
set
them
fast
down
in
a
southerly
direction
night
came
on
and
the
boats
dropped
the
grapnels
with
which
they
had
been
provided
and
philip
was
glad
to
find
that
the
current
was
not
near
so
strong
and
the
grapnels
held
both
boats
and
raft
covering
themselves
up
with
the
spare
sails
with
which
they
had
provided
themselves
and
setting
a
watch
the
tired
seamen
were
soon
fast
asleep
had
i
not
better
remain
in
one
of
the
boats
observed
krantz
suppose
to
save
themselves
the
boats
were
to
leave
the
raft
i
have
thought
of
that
replied
philip
and
have
therefore
not
allowed
any
provisions
or
water
in
the
boats
they
will
not
leave
us
for
that
reason
true
i
had
forgotten
that
krantz
remained
on
watch
and
philip
retired
to
the
repose
which
he
so
much
needed
amine
met
him
with
open
arms
i
have
no
fear
philip
said
she
i
rather
like
this
wild
adventurous
change
we
will
go
on
shore
and
build
our
hut
beneath
the
cocoa-trees
and
i
shall
repine
when
the
day
comes
which
brings
succour
and
releases
us
from
our
desert
isle
what
do
i
require
but
you
we
are
in
the
hands
of
one
above
dear
who
will
act
with
us
as
he
pleases
we
have
to
be
thankful
that
it
is
no
worse
replied
philip
but
now
to
rest
for
i
shall
soon
be
obliged
to
watch
the
morning
dawned
with
a
smooth
sea
and
a
bright
blue
sky
the
raft
had
been
borne
to
leeward
of
the
cluster
of
uninhabited
islands
of
which
we
spoke
and
was
now
without
hopes
of
reaching
them
but
to
the
westward
were
to
be
seen
on
the
horizon
the
refracted
heads
and
trunks
of
cocoa-nut
trees
and
in
that
direction
it
was
resolved
that
they
should
tow
the
raft
the
breakfast
had
been
served
out
and
the
men
had
taken
to
the
oars
when
they
discovered
a
proa
full
of
men
sweeping
after
them
from
one
of
the
islands
to
windward
that
it
was
a
pirate
vessel
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
philip
and
krantz
considered
that
their
force
was
more
than
sufficient
to
repel
them
should
an
attack
be
made
this
was
pointed
out
to
the
men
arms
were
distributed
to
all
in
the
boats
as
well
as
to
those
on
the
raft
and
that
the
seamen
might
not
be
fatigued
they
were
ordered
to
lie
on
their
oars
and
await
the
coming
up
of
the
vessel
as
soon
as
the
pirate
was
within
range
having
reconnoitred
her
antagonists
she
ceased
pulling
and
commenced
firing
from
a
small
piece
of
cannon
which
was
mounted
on
her
bows
the
grape
and
langridge
which
she
poured
upon
them
wounded
several
of
the
men
although
philip
had
ordered
them
to
lie
down
flat
on
the
raft
and
in
the
boats
the
pirate
advanced
nearer
and
her
fire
became
more
destructive
without
any
opportunity
of
returning
it
by
the
utrecht's
people
at
last
it
was
proposed
as
the
only
chance
of
escape
that
the
boats
should
attack
the
pirate
this
was
agreed
to
by
philip
more
men
were
sent
in
the
boats
krantz
took
the
command
the
raft
was
cast
off
and
the
boats
pulled
away
but
scarcely
had
they
cleared
the
raft
when
as
by
one
sudden
thought
they
turned
round
and
pulled
away
in
the
opposite
direction
krantz's
voice
was
heard
by
philip
and
his
sword
was
seen
to
sash
through
the
air
a
moment
afterwards
he
lunged
into
the
sea
and
swam
to
the
raft
it
appeared
that
the
people
in
the
boats
anxious
to
preserve
the
money
which
they
had
possession
of
had
agreed
among
themselves
to
pull
away
and
leave
the
raft
to
its
fate
the
proposal
for
attacking
the
pirate
had
been
suggested
with
that
view
and
as
soon
as
they
were
clear
of
the
raft
they
put
their
intentions
into
execution
in
vain
had
krantz
expostulated
and
threatened
they
would
have
taken
his
life
and
when
he
found
that
his
efforts
were
of
no
avail
he
leaped
from
the
boat
then
are
we
lost
i
fear
said
philip
our
numbers
are
so
reduced
that
we
cannot
hope
to
hold
out
long
what
think
you
schriften
ventured
philip
addressing
the
pilot
who
stood
near
to
him
lost--but
not
lost
by
the
pirates--no
harm
there
he
he
the
remark
of
schriften
was
correct
the
pirates
imagining
that
in
taking
to
their
boats
the
people
had
carried
with
them
everything
that
was
valuable
instead
of
firing
at
the
raft
immediately
gave
chase
to
the
boats
the
sweeps
were
now
out
and
the
proa
flew
over
the
smooth
water
like
a
sea-bird
passed
the
raft
and
was
at
first
evidently
gaining
on
the
boats
but
their
speed
soon
slackened
and
as
the
day
passed
the
boats
and
then
the
pirate
vessel
disappeared
in
the
southward
the
distance
between
them
being
apparently
much
the
same
as
at
the
commencement
of
the
chase
the
raft
being
now
at
the
mercy
of
the
wind
and
waves
philip
and
krantz
collected
the
carpenter's
tools
which
had
been
brought
from
the
ship
and
selecting
two
spars
from
the
raft
they
made
every
preparation
for
stepping
a
mast
and
setting
sail
by
the
next
morning
the
morning
dawned
and
the
first
objects
that
met
their
view
were
the
boats
pulling
back
towards
the
raft
followed
closely
by
the
pirate
the
men
had
pulled
the
whole
night
and
were
worn
out
with
fatigue
it
was
presumed
that
a
consultation
had
been
held
in
which
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
make
a
sweep
so
as
to
return
to
the
raft
as
if
they
gained
it
they
would
be
able
to
defend
themselves
and
moreover
obtain
provisions
and
water
which
they
had
not
on
board
at
the
time
of
their
desertion
but
it
was
fated
otherwise
gradually
the
men
dropped
from
their
oars
exhausted
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
the
pirate
vessel
followed
them
with
renewed
ardour
the
boats
were
captured
one
by
one
the
booty
found
was
more
than
the
pirates
anticipated
and
it
hardly
need
be
said
that
not
one
man
was
spared
all
this
took
place
within
three
miles
of
the
raft
and
philip
anticipated
that
the
next
movement
of
the
vessel
would
be
towards
them
but
he
was
mistaken
satisfied
with
their
booty
and
imagining
that
there
could
be
no
more
on
the
raft
the
pirate
pulled
away
to
the
eastward
towards
the
islands
from
amongst
which
she
had
first
made
her
appearance
thus
were
those
who
expected
to
escape
and
who
had
deserted
their
companions
deservedly
punished
whilst
those
who
anticipated
every
disaster
from
this
desertion
discovered
that
it
was
the
cause
of
their
being
saved
the
remaining
people
on
board
the
raft
amounted
to
about
forty-five
philip
krantz
schriften
amine
the
two
mates
sixteen
seamen
and
twenty-four
soldiers
who
had
been
embarked
at
amsterdam
of
provisions
they
had
sufficient
for
three
or
four
weeks
but
of
water
they
were
very
short
already
not
having
sufficient
for
more
than
three
days
at
the
usual
allowance
as
soon
as
the
mast
had
been
stepped
and
rigged
and
the
sails
set
although
there
was
hardly
a
breath
of
wind
philip
explained
to
the
men
the
necessity
of
reducing
the
quantity
of
water
and
it
was
agreed
that
it
should
be
served
out
so
as
to
extend
the
supply
to
twelve
days
the
allowance
being
reduced
to
half
a
pint
per
day
there
was
a
debate
at
this
time
as
the
raft
was
in
two
parts
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
cast
off
the
smaller
one
and
put
all
the
people
on
board
the
other
but
this
proposal
was
overruled
as
in
the
first
place
although
the
boats
had
deserted
them
the
number
on
the
raft
had
not
much
diminished
and
moreover
the
raft
would
steer
much
better
under
sail
now
that
it
had
length
than
it
would
do
if
they
reduced
its
dimensions
and
altered
its
shape
to
a
square
mass
of
floating
wood
for
three
days
it
was
a
calm
the
sun
poured
down
his
hot
beams
upon
them
and
the
want
of
water
was
severely
felt
those
who
continued
to
drink
spirits
suffered
the
most
on
the
fourth
day
the
breeze
sprung
up
favourably
and
the
sail
was
filled
it
was
a
relief
to
their
burning
brows
and
blistered
backs
and
as
the
raft
sailed
on
at
the
rate
of
four
miles
an
hour
the
men
were
gay
and
full
of
hope
the
land
below
the
cocoa-nut
trees
was
now
distinguishable
and
they
anticipated
that
the
next
day
they
could
land
and
procure
the
water
which
they
now
so
craved
for
all
night
they
carried
sail
but
the
next
morning
they
discovered
that
the
current
was
strong
against
them
and
that
what
they
gained
when
the
breeze
was
fresh
they
lost
from
the
adverse
current
as
soon
as
it
went
down
the
breeze
was
always
fresh
in
use
morning
but
it
fell
calm
in
the
evening
thus
did
they
continue
for
four
days
more
every
noon
being
not
ten
miles
from
the
land
but
the
next
morning
swept
away
to
a
distance
and
having
their
ground
to
retrace
eight
days
had
now
passed
and
the
men
worn
out
with
the
exposure
to
the
burning
sun
became
discontented
and
mutinous
at
one
time
they
insisted
that
the
raft
should
be
divided
that
they
might
gain
the
land
with
the
other
half
at
another
that
the
provisions
which
they
could
no
longer
eat
should
be
thrown
overboard
to
lighten
the
raft
the
difficulty
under
which
they
lay
was
the
having
no
anchor
or
grapnel
to
the
raft
the
boats
having
carried
away
with
them
all
that
had
been
taken
from
the
ship
philip
then
proposed
to
the
men
that
as
everyone
of
them
had
such
a
quantity
of
dollars
the
money
should
be
sewed
up
in
canvas
bags
each
man's
property
separate
and
that
with
this
weight
to
the
ropes
they
would
probably
be
enabled
to
hold
the
raft
against
the
current
for
one
night
when
they
would
be
able
the
next
day
to
gain
shore
but
this
was
refused--they
would
not
risk
their
money
no
no--fools
they
would
sooner
part
with
their
lives
by
the
most
miserable
of
all
deaths
again
and
again
was
this
proposed
to
them
by
philip
and
krantz
but
without
success
in
the
mean
time
amine
had
kept
up
her
courage
and
her
spirits
proving
to
philip
a
valuable
adviser
and
a
comforter
in
his
misfortunes
cheer
up
philip
would
she
say
we
shall
yet
build
our
cottage
under
the
shade
of
those
cocoa-nut
trees
and
pass
a
portion
if
not
the
remainder
of
our
lives
in
peace
for
who
indeed
is
there
who
would
think
to
find
us
in
these
desolate
and
untrodden
regions
schriften
was
quiet
and
well-behaved
talked
much
with
amine
but
with
nobody
else
indeed
he
appeared
to
have
a
stronger
feeling
in
favour
of
amine
than
he
had
ever
shown
before
he
watched
over
her
and
attended
her
and
amine
would
often
look
up
after
being
silent
and
perceive
schriften's
face
wear
an
air
of
pity
and
melancholy
which
she
had
believed
it
impossible
that
he
could
have
exhibited
another
day
passed
again
they
neared
the
land
and
again
did
the
breeze
die
away
and
they
were
swept
back
by
the
current
the
men
now
arose
and
in
spite
of
the
endeavours
of
philip
and
krantz
they
rolled
into
the
sea
all
the
provisions
and
stores
everything
but
one
cask
of
spirits
and
the
remaining
stock
of
water
they
then
sat
down
at
the
upper
end
of
the
raft
with
gloomy
threatening
looks
and
in
close
consultation
another
night
closed
in
philip
was
full
of
anxiety
again
he
urged
them
to
anchor
with
their
money
but
in
vain
they
ordered
him
away
and
he
returned
to
the
after
part
of
the
raft
upon
which
amine's
secure
retreat
had
been
erected
he
leant
on
it
in
deep
thought
and
melancholy
for
he
imagined
that
amine
was
asleep
what
disturbs
you
philip
what
disturbs
me
the
avarice
and
folly
of
these
men
they
will
die
rather
than
risk
their
hateful
money
they
have
the
means
of
saving
themselves
and
us
and
they
will
not
there
is
weight
enough
in
bullion
on
the
fore
part
of
the
raft
to
hold
a
dozen
floating
masses
such
as
this
yet
they
will
not
risk
it
cursed
love
of
gold
it
makes
men
fools
madmen
villains
we
have
now
but
two
days'
water--doled
out
as
it
is
drop
by
drop
look
at
their
emaciated
broken-down
wasted
forms
and
yet
see
how
they
cling
to
money
which
probably
they
will
never
have
occasion
for
even
if
they
gain
the
land
i
am
distracted
you
suffer
philip
you
suffer
from
privation
but
i
have
been
careful
i
thought
that
this
would
come
i
have
saved
both
water
and
biscuit--i
have
here
four
bottles--drink
philip
and
it
will
relieve
you
philip
drank
it
did
relieve
him
for
the
excitement
of
the
day
had
pressed
heavily
on
him
thanks
amine--thanks
dearest
i
feel
better
now--good
heaven
are
they
such
fools
as
to
value
the
dross
of
metal
above
one
drop
of
water
in
a
time
of
suffering
and
privation
such
as
this
the
night
closed
in
as
before
the
stars
shone
bright
but
there
was
no
moon
philip
had
risen
at
midnight
to
relieve
krantz
from
the
steerage
of
the
raft
usually
the
men
had
lain
about
in
every
part
of
the
raft
but
this
night
the
majority
of
them
remained
forward
philip
was
communing
with
his
own
bitter
thoughts
when
he
heard
a
scuffle
forward
and
the
voice
of
krantz
crying
out
to
him
for
help
he
quitted
the
helm
and
seizing
his
cutlass
ran
forward
where
he
found
krantz
down
and
the
men
securing
him
he
fought
his
way
to
him
but
was
himself
seized
and
disarmed
cut
away--cut
away
was
called
out
by
those
who
held
him
and
in
a
few
seconds
philip
had
the
misery
to
behold
the
after
part
of
the
raft
with
amine
upon
it
drifted
apart
from
the
one
on
which
he
stood
for
mercy's
sake
my
wife--my
amine--for
heaven's
sake
save
her
cried
philip
struggling
in
vain
to
disengage
himself
amine
also
who
had
run
to
the
side
of
the
raft
held
out
her
arms--it
was
in
vain--they
were
separated
more
than
a
cable's
length
philip
made
one
more
desperate
struggle
and
then
fell
down
deprived
of
sense
and
motion
it
was
not
until
the
day
had
dawned
that
philip
opened
his
eyes
and
discovered
krantz
kneeling
at
his
side
at
first
his
thoughts
were
scattered
and
confused
he
felt
that
some
dreadful
calamity
had
happened
to
him
but
he
could
not
recall
to
mind
what
it
was
at
last
it
rushed
upon
him
and
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
take
comfort
said
krantz
we
shall
probably
gain
the
shore
to-day
and
we
will
go
in
search
of
her
as
soon
as
we
can
this
then
is
the
separation
and
the
cruel
death
to
her
which
that
wretch
schriften
prophesied
to
us
thought
philip
cruel
indeed
to
waste
away
to
a
skeleton
under
a
burning
sun
without
one
drop
of
water
left
to
cool
her
parched
tongue
at
the
mercy
of
the
winds
and
waves
drifting
about--alone--all
alone--separated
from
her
husband
in
whose
arms
she
would
have
died
without
regret
maddened
with
suspense
and
with
the
thoughts
of
what
i
may
be
suffering
or
what
may
have
been
my
fate
pilot
you
are
right
there
can
be
no
more
cruel
death
to
a
fond
and
doting
wife
oh
my
head
reels
what
has
philip
vanderdecken
to
live
for
now
krantz
offered
such
consolation
as
his
friendship
could
suggest
but
in
vain
he
then
talked
of
revenge
and
philip
raised
his
head
after
a
few
minutes'
thought
he
rose
us
yes
replied
he
revenge--revenge
upon
these
dastards
and
traitors
tell
me
krantz
how
many
can
we
trust
half
of
the
men
i
should
think
at
least
it
was
a
surprise
a
spar
had
been
fitted
as
a
rudder
and
the
raft
had
now
gained
nearer
the
shore
than
it
ever
had
done
before
the
men
were
in
high
spirits
at
the
prospect
and
every
man
was
sitting
on
his
own
store
of
dollars
which
in
their
eyes
increased
in
value
in
proportion
as
did
their
prospect
of
escape
philip
discovered
from
krantz
that
it
was
the
soldiers
and
the
most
indifferent
seamen
who
had
mutinied
on
the
night
before
and
cut
away
the
other
raft
and
that
all
the
best
men
had
remained
neuter
and
so
they
will
be
now
i
imagine
continued
krantz
the
prospect
of
gaining
the
shore
has
in
a
manner
reconciled
them
to
the
treachery
of
their
companions
probably
replied
philip
with
a
bitter
laugh
but
i
know
what
will
rouse
them
send
them
here
to
me
philip
talked
to
the
seamen
whom
krantz
had
sent
over
to
him
he
pointed
out
to
them
that
the
other
men
were
traitors
not
to
be
relied
upon
that
they
would
sacrifice
everything
and
everybody
for
their
own
gain
that
they
had
already
done
so
for
money
and
that
they
themselves
would
have
no
security
either
on
the
raft
or
on
shore
with
such
people
that
they
dare
not
sleep
for
fear
of
having
their
throats
cut
and
that
it
were
better
at
once
to
get
rid
of
those
who
could
not
be
true
to
each
other
that
it
would
facilitate
their
escape
and
that
they
could
divide
between
themselves
the
money
which
the
others
had
secured
and
by
which
they
would
double
their
own
shares
that
it
had
been
his
intention
although
he
had
said
nothing
to
enforce
the
restoration
of
the
money
for
the
benefit
of
the
company
as
soon
as
they
had
gained
a
civilised
port
where
the
authorities
could
interfere
but
that
if
they
consented
to
join
and
aid
him
he
would
now
give
them
the
whole
of
it
for
their
own
use
what
will
not
the
desire
of
gain
effect
is
it
therefore
to
be
wondered
at
that
these
men
who
were
indeed
but
little
better
than
those
who
were
thus
in
his
desire
of
retaliation
denounced
by
philip
consented
to
his
proposal
it
was
agreed
that
if
they
did
not
gain
the
shore
the
others
should
be
attacked
that
very
night
and
tossed
into
the
sea
but
the
consultation
with
philip
had
put
the
other
party
on
the
alert
they
too
held
council
and
kept
their
arms
by
their
sides
as
the
breeze
died
away
they
were
not
two
miles
from
the
land
and
once
more
they
drifted
back
into
the
ocean
philip's
mind
was
borne
down
with
grief
at
the
loss
of
amine
but
it
recovered
to
a
certain
degree
when
he
thought
of
revenge
that
feeling
stayed
him
up
and
he
often
felt
the
edge
of
his
cutlass
impatient
for
the
moment
of
retribution
it
was
a
lovely
night
the
sea
was
now
smooth
as
glass
and
not
a
breath
of
air
moved
in
the
heavens
the
sail
of
the
raft
hung
listless
down
the
mast
and
was
reflected
upon
the
calm
surface
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
starry
night
alone
it
was
a
night
for
contemplation--for
examination
of
oneself
and
adoration
of
the
deity
and
here
on's
frail
raft
were
huddled
together
more
than
forty
beings
ready
for
combat
for
murder
and
for
spoil
each
party
pretended
to
repose
yet
each
were
quietly
watching
the
motions
of
the
other
with
their
hands
upon
their
weapons
the
signal
was
to
be
given
by
philip
it
was
to
let
go
the
halyards
of
the
yard
so
that
the
sail
should
fall
down
upon
a
portion
of
the
other
party
and
entangle
them
by
philip's
directions
schriften
had
taken
the
helm
and
krantz
remained
by
his
side
the
yard
and
sail
fell
clattering
down
and
then
the
work
of
death
commenced
there
was
no
parley
no
suspense
each
man
started
upon
his
feet
and
raised
his
sword
the
voices
of
philip
and
of
krantz
alone
were
heard
and
philip's
sword
did
its
work
he
was
nerved
to
his
revenge
and
never
could
be
satiated
as
long
as
one
remained
who
had
sacrificed
his
amine
as
philip
had
expected
many
had
been
covered
up
and
entangled
by
the
falling
of
the
sail
and
their
work
was
thereby
made
easier
some
fell
where
they
stood
others
reeled
back
and
sunk
down
under
the
smooth
water
others
were
pierced
as
they
floundered
under
the
canvas
in
a
few
minutes
the
work
of
carnage
was
complete
schriften
meanwhile
looked
on
and
ever
and
anon
gave
vent
to
his
chuckling
laugh--his
demoniacal
he
he
the
strife
was
over
and
philip
stood
against
the
mast
to
recover
his
breath
so
far
art
thou
revenged
my
amine
thought
he
but
oh
what
are
these
paltry
lives
compared
to
thine
and
now
that
his
revenge
was
satiated
and
he
could
do
no
more
be
covered
his
face
up
in
his
hands
and
wept
bitterly
while
those
who
had
assisted
him
were
already
collecting
the
money
of
the
slain
for
distribution
these
men
when
they
found
that
three
only
of
their
side
had
fallen
lamented
that
there
had
not
been
more
as
their
own
shares
of
the
dollars
would
have
been
increased
there
were
now
but
thirteen
men
besides
philip
krantz
and
schriften
left
upon
the
raft
as
the
day
dawned
the
breeze
again
sprung
up
and
they
shared
out
the
portions
of
water
which
would
have
been
the
allowance
of
their
companions
who
had
fallen
hunger
they
felt
not
but
the
water
revived
their
spirits
although
philip
had
had
little
to
say
to
schriften
since
the
separation
from
amine
it
was
very
evident
to
him
and
to
krantz
that
all
the
pilot's
former
bitter
feelings
had
returned
his
chuckle
his
sarcasms
his
he
he
were
incessant
and
his
eye
was
now
as
maliciously
directed
to
philip
as
it
was
when
they
first
met
it
was
evident
that
amine
alone
had
for
the
time
conquered
his
disposition
and
that
with
her
disappearance
had
vanished
all
the
good
will
of
schriften
towards
her
husband
for
this
philip
cared
little
he
had
a
much
more
serious
weight
on
his
heart--the
loss
of
his
dear
amine
and
he
felt
reckless
and
indifferent
concerning
anything
else
the
breeze
now
freshened
and
they
expected
that
in
two
hours
they
would
run
on
the
beach
but
they
were
disappointed
the
step
of
the
mast
gave
way
from
the
force
of
the
wind
and
the
sail
fell
upon
the
raft
this
occasioned
great
delay
and
before
they
could
repair
the
mischief
the
wind
again
subsided
and
they
were
left
about
a
mile
from
the
beach
tired
and
worn
out
with
his
feelings
philip
at
last
fell
asleep
by
the
side
of
krantz
leaving
schriften
at
the
helm
he
slept
soundly--he
dreamt
of
amine--he
thought
she
was
under
a
grove
of
cocoa-nuts
in
a
sweet
sleep
that
he
stood
by
and
watched
her
and
that
she
smiled
in
her
sleep
and
murmured
philip
when
suddenly
he
was
awakened
by
some
unusual
movement
half
dreaming
still
he
thought
that
schriften
the
pilot
had
in
his
sleep
been
attempting
to
gain
his
relic
had
passed
the
chain
over
his
head
and
was
removing
quietly
from
underneath
his
neck
the
portion
of
the
chain
which
in
his
reclining
posture
he
lay
upon
startled
at
the
idea
he
threw
up
his
hand
to
seize
the
arm
of
the
wretch
and
found
that
he
had
really
seized
hold
of
schriften
who
was
kneeling
by
him
and
in
possession
of
the
chain
and
relic
the
struggle
was
short
the
relic
was
recovered
and
the
pilot
lay
at
the
mercy
of
philip
who
held
him
down
with
his
knee
on
his
chest
philip
replaced
the
relic
on
his
bosom
and
excited
to
madness
rose
from
the
body
of
the
now
breathless
schriften
caught
it
in
his
arms
and
hurled
it
into
the
sea
man
or
devil
i
care
not
which
exclaimed
philip
breathless
escape
now
if
you
can
the
struggle
had
already
roused
up
krantz
and
others
but
not
in
time
to
prevent
philip
from
wreaking
his
vengeance
upon
schriften
in
few
words
he
told
krantz
what
had
passed
as
for
the
men
they
cared
not
they
laid
their
heads
down
again
and
satisfied
that
their
money
was
safe
inquired
no
further
philip
watched
to
see
if
schriften
would
rise
up
again
and
try
to
regain
the
raft
but
he
did
not
make
his
appearance
above
water
and
philip
felt
satisfied
what
pen
could
portray
the
feelings
of
the
fond
and
doting
amine
when
she
first
discovered
that
she
was
separated
from
her
husband
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
she
watched
the
other
raft
as
the
distance
between
them
increased
at
last
the
shades
of
night
hid
it
from
her
aching
eyes
and
she
dropped
down
in
mute
despair
gradually
she
recovered
herself
and
turning
round
she
exclaimed
who's
here
no
answer
who's
here
cried
she
in
a
louder
voice
alone--alone--and
philip
gone
mother
mother
look
down
upon
your
unhappy
child
and
amine
frantically
threw
herself
down
so
near
to
the
edge
of
the
raft
that
her
long
hair
which
had
fallen
down
floated
on
the
wave
ah
me
where
am
i
cried
amine
after
remaining
in
a
state
of
torpor
for
some
hours
the
sun
glared
fiercely
upon
her
and
dazzled
her
eyes
as
she
opened
them--she
cast
them
on
the
blue
wave
close
by
her
and
beheld
a
large
shark
motionless
by
the
side
of
the
raft
waiting
for
his
prey
recoiling
from
the
edge
she
started
up
she
turned
round
and
beheld
the
raft
vacant
and
the
truth
flashed
on
her
oh
philip
philip
cried
she
then
it
is
true
and
you
are
gone
for
ever
i
thought
it
was
only
a
dream
i
recollect
all
now
yes--all--all
and
amine
sank
down
again
upon
her
cot
which
had
been
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
raft
and
remained
motionless
for
some
time
but
the
demand
for
water
became
imperious
she
seized
one
of
the
bottles
and
drank
yet
why
should
i
drink
or
eat
why
should
i
wish
to
preserve
life
she
rose
and
looked
round
the
horizon
sky
and
water
nothing
more
is
this
the
death
i
am
to
die--the
cruel
death
prophesied
by
schriften--a
lingering
death
under
a
burning
sun
while
my
vitals
are
parched
within
be
it
so
fate
i
dare
thee
to
thy
worst--
we
can
die
but
once--and
without
him
what
care
i
to
live
but
yet
i
may
see
him
again
continued
amine
hurriedly
after
a
pause
yes
i
may--who
knows
then
welcome
life
i'll
nurse
thee
for
that
bare
hope--
bare
indeed
with
naught
to
feed
on
let
me
see--is
it
here
still
amine
looked
at
her
zone
and
perceived
her
dagger
was
still
in
it
well
then
i
will
live
since
death
is
at
my
command
and
be
guardful
of
life
for
my
dear
husband's
sake
and
amine
threw
herself
on
her
resting-place
that
she
might
forget
every
thing
she
did
from
that
morning
till
the
noon
of
the
next
day
she
remained
in
a
state
of
torpor
when
she
again
rose
she
was
faint
again
she
looked
round
her--there
was
but
sky
and
water
to
be
seen
oh
this
solitude--it
is
horrible
death
would
be
a
release--but
no
i
must
not
die--i
must
live
for
philip
she
refreshed
herself
with
water
and
a
few
pieces
of
biscuit
and
folded
her
arms
across
her
breast
a
few
more
days
without
relief
and
all
must
be
over
was
ever
woman
situated
as
i
am
and
yet
i
dare
to
indulge
hope
why
'tis
madness
and
why
am
i
thus
singled
out
because
i
have
wedded
with
philip
it
may
be
so
if
so
i
welcome
it
wretches
who
thus
severed
me
from
my
husband
who
to
save
their
own
lives
sacrificed
a
helpless
woman
nay
they
might
have
saved
me
if
they
had
had
the
least
pity--but
no
they
never
felt
it
and
these
are
christians
the
creed
that
the
old
priests
would
have
had
me--yes
that
philip
would
have
had
me
embrace
charity
and
good-will
they
talk
of
it
but
i
have
never
seen
them
practise
it
loving
one
another--forgiving
one
another--say
rather
hating
and
preying
upon
one
another
a
creed
never
practised
why
if
not
practised
of
what
value
is
it
any
creed
were
better--i
abjure
it
and
if
i
be
saved
will
abjure
it
still
for
ever
shade
of
my
mother
is
it
that
i
have
listened
to
these
men--that
i
have
to
win
my
husband's
love
tried
to
forget
that
which
thou
taughtest
even
when
a
child
at
thy
feet--that
faith
which
our
forefathers
for
thousands
of
years
lived
and
died
in--that
creed
proved
by
works
and
obedience
to
the
prophet's
willis
it
for
this
that
i
am
punished
tell
me
mother--oh
tell
me
in
my
dreams
the
night
closed
in
and
with
the
gloom
rose
heavy
clouds
the
lightning
darted
through
the
firmament
ever
and
anon
lighting
up
the
raft
at
last
the
flashes
were
so
rapid
not
following
each
other--but
darting
down
from
every
quarter
at
once
that
the
whole
firmament
appeared
as
if
on
fire
and
the
thunder
rolled
along
the
heavens
now
near
and
loud
then
rumbling
in
the
distance
the
breeze
rose
up
fresh
and
the
waves
tossed
the
raft
and
washed
occasionally
even
to
amine's
feet
as
she
stood
in
the
centre
of
it
i
like
this--this
is
far
better
than
that
calm
and
withering
heat--this
rouses
me
said
amine
as
she
cast
her
eyes
up
and
watched
the
forked
lightning
till
her
vision
became
obscured
yes
this
is
as
it
should
be
lightning
strike
me
if
you
please--waves
wash
me
off
and
bury
me
in
a
briny
tomb--pour
the
wrath
of
the
whole
elements
upon
this
devoted
head--i
care
not
i
laugh
at
i
defy
it
all
thou
canst
but
kill
this
little
steel
can
do
as
much
let
those
who
hoard
up
wealth--those
who
live
in
splendour--those
that
are
happy--those
who
have
husbands
children
aught
to
love--let
them
tremble
i
have
nothing
elements
be
ye
fire
or
water
or
earth
or
air
amine
defies
you
and
yet--no
no
deceive
not
thyself
amine
there
is
no
hope
thus
will
i
mount
my
funeral
bier
and
wait
the
will
of
destiny
and
amine
regained
the
secure
place
which
philip
had
fitted
up
for
her
in
the
centre
of
the
raft
threw
herself
down
upon
her
bed
and
shut
her
eyes
the
thunder
and
lightning
was
followed
up
by
torrents
of
heavy
rain
which
fell
till
daylight
the
wind
still
continued
fresh
but
the
sky
cleared
and
the
sun
shone
out
amine
remained
shivering
in
her
wet
garments
the
heat
of
the
sun
proved
too
powerful
for
her
exhausted
state
and
her
brain
wandered
she
rose
up
in
a
sitting
posture
looked
around
her
saw
verdant
fields
in
every
direction
the
cocoa-nuts
waving
to
the
wind--imagined
even
that
she
saw
her
own
philip
in
the
distance
hastening
to
her
she
held
out
her
arms
strove
to
get
up
and
run
to
meet
him
but
her
limbs
refused
their
office
she
called
to
him
she
screamed
and
sank
back
exhausted
on
her
resting-place
we
must
for
a
time
return
to
philip
and
follow
his
strange
destiny
a
few
hours
after
he
had
thrown
the
pilot
into
the
sea
they
gained
the
shore
so
long
looked
at
with
anxiety
and
suspense
the
spars
of
the
raft
jerked
by
the
running
swell
undulated
and
rubbed
against
each
other
as
they
rose
and
fell
to
the
waves
breaking
on
the
beach
the
breeze
was
fresh
but
the
surf
was
trifling
and
the
landing
was
without
difficulty
the
beach
was
shelving
of
firm
white
sand
interspersed
and
strewed
with
various
brilliant-coloured
shells
and
here
and
there
the
bleached
fragments
and
bones
of
some
animal
which
had
been
forced
out
of
its
element
to
die
the
island
was
like
all
the
others
covered
with
a
thick
wood
of
cocoa-nut
trees
whose
tops
waved
to
the
breeze
or
bowed
to
the
blast
producing
a
shade
and
a
freshness
which
would
have
been
duly
appreciated
by
any
other
party
than
the
present
with
the
exception
only
of
krantz
for
philip
thought
of
nothing
but
his
lost
wife
and
the
seamen
thought
of
nothing
but
of
their
sudden
wealth
krantz
supported
philip
to
the
beach
and
led
him
to
the
shade
but
after
a
minute
he
rose
and
running
down
to
the
nearest
point
looked
anxiously
for
the
portion
of
the
raft
which
held
amine
which
was
now
far
far
away
krantz
had
followed
aware
that
now
the
first
paroxysms
were
past
there
was
no
fear
of
philip's
throwing
away
his
life
gone
gone
for
ever
exclaimed
philip
pressing
his
hands
to
the
balls
of
his
eyes
not
so
philip
the
same
providence
which
has
preserved
us
will
certainly
assist
her
it
is
impossible
that
she
can
perish
among
so
many
islands
many
of
which
are
inhabited
and
a
woman
will
be
certain
of
kind
treatment
if
i
could
only
think
so
replied
philip
a
little
reflection
may
induce
you
to
think
that
it
is
rather
an
advantage
than
otherwise
that
she
is
thus
separated--not
from
you
but
from
so
many
lawless
companions
whose
united
force
we
could
not
resist
do
you
think
that
after
any
lengthened
sojourn
on
this
island
these
people
with
us
would
permit
you
to
remain
in
quiet
possession
of
your
wife
no--they
would
respect
no
laws
and
amine
has
in
my
opinion
been
miraculously
preserved
from
shame
and
ill
treatment
if
not
from
death
they
durst
not
surely
well
but
krantz
we
must
make
a
raft
and
follow
her
we
must
not
remain
here--i
will
seek
her
through
the
wide
world
be
it
so
if
you
wish
philip
and
i
will
follow
your
fortunes
replied
krantz
glad
to
find
that
there
was
something
however
wild
the
idea
for
his
mind
to
feed
on
but
now
let
us
return
to
the
raft
seek
the
refreshment
we
so
much
require
and
after
that
we
will
consider
what
may
be
the
best
plan
to
pursue
to
this
philip
who
was
much
exhausted
tacitly
consented
and
he
followed
krantz
to
where
the
raft
had
been
beached
the
men
had
left
it
and
were
each
of
them
sitting
apart
from
one
another
under
the
shade
of
his
own
chosen
cocoa-nut
tree
the
articles
which
had
been
saved
on
the
raft
had
not
been
landed
and
krantz
called
upon
them
to
come
and
carry
the
things
on
shore--but
no
one
would
answer
or
obey
they
each
sat
watching
their
money
and
afraid
to
leave
it
lest
they
should
be
dispossessed
of
it
by
the
others
now
that
their
lives
were
comparatively
speaking
safe
the
demon
of
avarice
had
taken
full
possession
of
their
souls
there
they
sat
exhausted
pining
for
water
longing
for
sleep
and
yet
they
dared
not
move--they
were
fixed
as
if
by
the
wand
of
the
enchanter
it
is
the
cursed
dollars
which
have
turned
their
brains
observed
krantz
to
philip
let
us
try
if
we
cannot
manage
to
remove
what
we
most
stand
in
need
of
and
then
we
will
search
for
water
philip
and
krantz
collected
the
carpenter's
tools
the
best
arms
and
all
the
ammunition
as
the
possession
of
the
latter
would
give
them
an
advantage
in
case
of
necessity
they
then
dragged
on
shore
the
sail
and
some
small
spars
all
of
which
they
carried
up
to
a
clump
of
cocoa-nut
trees
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
beach
in
half
an
hour
they
had
erected
an
humble
tent
and
put
into
it
what
they
had
brought
with
them
with
the
exception
of
the
major
part
of
the
ammunition
which
as
soon
as
he
was
screened
by
the
tent
krantz
buried
in
a
heap
of
dry
sand
behind
it
he
then
for
their
immediate
wants
cut
down
with
an
axe
a
small
cocoa-nut
tree
in
full
bearing
it
must
be
for
those
who
have
suffered
the
agony
of
prolonged
thirst
to
know
the
extreme
pleasure
with
which
the
milk
of
the
nuts
were
one
after
the
other
poured
down
the
parched
throats
of
krantz
and
philip
the
men
witnessed
their
enjoyment
in
silence
and
with
gloating
eyes
every
time
that
a
fresh
cocoa-nut
was
seized
and
its
contents
quaffed
by
their
officers
more
sharp
and
agonising
was
their
own
devouring
thirst--still
closer
did
their
dry
lips
glue
themselves
together--yet
they
moved
not
although
they
felt
the
tortures
of
the
condemned
evening
closed
in
philip
had
thrown
himself
down
on
the
spare
sails
and
had
fallen
asleep
when
krantz
set
off
to
explore
the
island
upon
which
they
had
been
thrown
it
was
small
not
exceeding
three
miles
in
length
and
at
no
one
part
more
than
five
hundred
yards
across
water
there
was
none
unless
it
were
to
be
obtained
by
digging
fortunately
the
young
cocoa-nuts
prevented
the
absolute
necessity
for
it
on
his
return
krantz
passed
the
men
in
their
respective
stations
each
was
awake
and
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
to
ascertain
if
it
were
an
assailant
but
perceiving
krantz
they
again
dropped
down
krantz
passed
the
raft--the
water
was
now
quite
smooth
for
the
wind
had
shifted
off
shore
and
the
spars
which
composed
the
raft
hardly
jostled
each
other
he
stepped
upon
it
and
as
the
moon
was
bright
in
the
heavens
he
took
the
precaution
of
collecting
all
the
arms
which
had
been
left
and
throwing
them
as
far
as
he
could
into
the
sea
he
then
walked
to
the
tent
where
he
found
philip
still
sleeping
soundly
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
reposing
by
his
side
and
philip's
dreams
were
of
amine
he
thought
that
he
saw
the
hated
schriften
rise
again
from
the
waters
and
climbing
up
to
the
raft
seat
himself
by
her
side
he
thought
that
he
again
heard
his
unearthly
chuckle
and
his
scornful
laugh
as
his
unwelcome
words
fell
upon
her
distracted
ears
he
thought
that
she
fled
into
the
sea
to
avoid
schriften
and
that
the
waters
appeared
to
reject
her--she
floated
on
the
surface
the
storm
rose
and
once
more
he
beheld
her
in
the
sea-shell
skimming
over
the
waves
again
she
was
in
a
furious
surf
on
the
beach
and
her
shell
sank
and
she
was
buried
in
the
waves
and
then
he
saw
her
walking
on
shore
without
fear
and
without
harm
for
the
water
which
spared
no
one
appeared
to
spare
her
philip
tried
to
join
her
but
was
prevented
by
some
unknown
power
and
amine
waved
her
hand
and
said
we
shall
meet
again
philip
yes
once
more
on
this
earth
shall
we
meet
again
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
and
scorching
in
his
heat
when
krantz
first
opened
his
eyes
and
awakened
philip
the
axe
again
procured
for
them
their
morning's
meal
philip
was
silent
he
was
ruminating
upon
his
dreams
which
had
afforded
him
consolation
we
shall
meet
again
thought
he
yes
once
more
at
least
we
shall
meet
again
providence
i
thank
thee
krantz
then
stepped
out
to
ascertain
the
condition
of
the
men
he
found
them
faint
and
so
exhausted
that
they
could
not
possibly
survive
much
longer
yet
still
watching
over
their
darling
treasure
it
was
melancholy
to
witness
such
perversion
of
intellect
and
krantz
thought
of
a
plan
which
might
save
their
lives
he
proposed
to
them
each
separately
that
they
should
bury
their
money
so
deep
that
it
was
not
to
be
recovered
without
time
this
would
prevent
any
one
from
attacking
the
treasure
of
the
other
without
its
being
perceived
and
the
attempt
frustrated
and
would
enable
them
to
obtain
their
necessary
food
and
refreshment
without
danger
of
being
robbed
to
this
plan
they
acceded
krantz
brought
out
of
the
tent
the
only
shovel
in
their
possession
and
they
one
by
one
buried
their
dollars
many
feet
deep
in
the
yielding
sand
when
they
had
all
secured
their
wealth
he
brought
them
one
of
the
axes
and
the
cocoa-nut
trees
fell
and
they
were
restored
to
new
life
and
vigour
having
satiated
themselves
they
then
lay
down
upon
the
several
spots
under
which
they
had
buried
their
dollars
and
were
soon
enjoying
that
repose
which
they
all
so
much
needed
philip
and
krantz
had
now
many
serious
consultations
as
to
the
means
which
should
be
taken
for
quitting
the
island
and
going
in
search
of
amine
for
although
krantz
thought
the
latter
part
of
philip's
proposal
useless
he
did
not
venture
to
say
so
to
quit
this
island
was
necessary
and
provided
they
gained
one
of
those
which
were
inhabited
it
was
all
that
they
could
expect
as
for
amine
he
considered
that
she
was
dead
before
this
either
having
been
washed
off
the
raft
or
that
her
body
was
lying
on
it
exposed
to
the
decomposing
heat
of
a
torrid
sun
to
cheer
philip
he
expressed
himself
otherwise
and
whenever
they
talked
about
leaving
the
island
it
was
not
to
save
their
own
lives
but
invariably
to
search
after
philip's
lost
wife
the
plan
which
they
proposed
and
acted
upon
was
to
construct
a
light
raft
the
centre
to
be
composed
of
three
water-casks
sawed
in
half
in
a
row
behind
each
other
firmly
fixed
by
cross
pieces
to
two
long
spars
on
each
side
this
under
sail
would
move
quickly
through
the
water
and
be
manageable
so
as
to
enable
them
to
steer
a
course
the
outside
spars
had
been
selected
and
hauled
on
shore
and
the
work
was
already
in
progress
but
they
were
left
alone
in
their
work
for
the
seamen
appeared
to
have
no
idea
at
present
of
quitting
the
island
restored
by
food
and
repose
they
were
now
not
content
with
the
money
which
they
had--they
were
anxious
for
more
a
portion
of
each
party's
wealth
had
been
dug
up
and
they
now
gambled
all
day
with
pebbles
which
they
had
collected
on
the
beach
and
with
which
they
had
invented
a
game
another
evil
had
crept
among
them
they
had
cut
steps
in
the
largest
cocoa-nut
trees
and
with
the
activity
of
seamen
had
mounted
them
and
by
tapping
the
top
of
the
trees
and
fixing
empty
cocoa-nuts
underneath
had
obtained
the
liquor
which
in
its
first
fermentation
is
termed
toddy
and
is
afterwards
distilled
into
arrack
but
as
toddy
it
is
quite
sufficient
to
intoxicate
and
every
day
the
scenes
of
violence
and
intoxication
accompanied
with
oaths
and
execrations
became
more
and
more
dreadful
the
losers
tore
their
hair
and
rushed
like
madmen
upon
those
who
had
gained
their
dollars
but
krantz
had
fortunately
thrown
their
weapons
into
the
sea
and
those
he
had
saved
as
well
as
the
ammunition
he
had
secreted
blows
and
bloodshed
therefore
were
continual
but
loss
of
life
there
was
none
as
the
contending
parties
were
separated
by
the
others
who
were
anxious
that
the
play
should
not
be
interrupted
such
had
been
the
state
of
affairs
for
now
nearly
a
fortnight
while
the
work
of
the
raft
had
slowly
proceeded
some
of
the
men
had
lost
their
all
and
had
by
the
general
consent
of
those
who
had
won
their
wealth
been
banished
to
a
certain
distance
that
they
might
not
pilfer
from
them
these
walked
gloomily
round
the
island
or
on
the
beach
seeking
some
instrument
by
which
they
might
avenge
themselves
and
obtain
repossession
of
their
money
krantz
and
philip
had
proposed
to
these
men
to
join
them
and
leave
the
island
but
they
had
sullenly
refused
the
axe
was
now
never
parted
with
by
krantz
he
cut
down
what
cocoa-nut
trees
they
required
for
subsistence
and
prevented
the
men
from
notching
more
trees
to
procure
the
means
of
inebriation
on
the
sixteenth
day
all
the
money
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
three
men
who
had
been
more
fortunate
than
the
rest
the
losers
were
now
by
far
the
more
numerous
party
and
the
consequence
was
that
the
next
morning
these
three
men
were
found
lying
strangled
on
the
beach
the
money
had
been
re-divided
and
the
gambling
had
re-commenced
with
more
vigour
than
ever
how
can
this
end
exclaimed
philip
to
krantz
as
he
looked
upon
the
blackened
countenances
of
the
murdered
men
in
the
death
of
all
replied
krantz
we
cannot
prevent
it
it
is
a
judgment
the
raft
was
now
ready
the
sand
had
been
dug
from
beneath
it
so
as
to
allow
the
water
to
flow
in
and
float
it
and
it
was
now
made
fast
to
a
stake
and
riding
on
the
peaceful
waters
a
large
store
of
cocoa-nuts
old
and
young
had
been
procured
and
put
on
board
of
her
and
it
was
the
intention
of
philip
and
krantz
to
have
quitted
the
island
the
next
day
unfortunately
one
of
the
men
when
bathing
had
perceived
the
arms
lying
in
the
shallow
water
he
had
dived
down
and
procured
a
cutlass
others
had
followed
his
example
and
all
had
armed
themselves
this
induced
philip
and
krantz
to
sleep
on
board
of
the
raft
and
keep
watch
and
that
night
as
the
play
was
going
on
a
heavy
loss
on
one
side
ended
in
a
general
fray
the
combat
was
furious
for
all
were
more
or
less
excited
by
intoxication
the
result
was
melancholy
for
only
three
were
left
alive
philip
with
krantz
watched
the
issue
every
man
who
fell
wounded
was
put
to
the
sword
and
the
three
left
who
had
been
fighting
on
the
same
side
rested
panting
on
their
weapons
after
a
pause
two
of
them
communicated
with
each
other
and
the
result
was
an
attack
upon
the
third
man
who
fell
dead
beneath
their
blows
merciful
father
are
these
thy
creatures
exclaimed
philip
no
replied
krantz
they
worshipped
the
devil
as
mammon
do
you
imagine
that
those
two
who
could
now
divide
more
wealth
than
they
could
well
spend
if
they
return
to
their
country--will
consent
to
a
division
never--they
must
have
all--yes
all
krantz
had
hardly
expressed
his
opinion
when
one
of
the
men
taking
advantage
of
the
other
turning
round
a
moment
from
him
passed
his
sword
through
his
back
the
man
fell
with
a
groan
and
the
sword
was
again
passed
through
his
body
said
i
not
so
but
the
treacherous
villain
shall
not
reap
his
reward
continued
krantz
levelling
the
musket
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
shooting
him
dead
you
have
done
wrong
krantz
you
have
saved
him
from
the
punishment
he
deserved
left
alone
on
the
island
without
the
means
of
obtaining
his
subsistence
he
must
have
perished
miserably
and
by
inches
with
all
his
money
round
him
that
would
have
been
torture
indeed
perhaps
i
was
wrong
if
so
may
providence
forgive
me
i
could
not
help
it
let
us
go
ashore
for
we
are
now
on
this
island
alone
we
must
collect
the
treasure
and
bury
it
so
that
it
may
be
recovered
and
at
the
same
time
take
a
portion
with
us
for
who
knows
but
that
we
may
have
occasion
for
it
tomorrow
we
had
better
remain
here
for
we
shall
have
enough
to
do
in
burying
the
bodies
of
these
infatuated
men
and
the
wealth
which
has
caused
their
destruction
philip
agreed
to
the
propriety
of
the
suggestion
the
next
day
they
buried
the
bodies
where
they
lay
and
the
treasure
was
all
collected
in
a
deep
trench
under
a
cocoa-nut
tree
which
they
carefully
marked
with
their
axe
about
five
hundred
pieces
of
gold
were
selected
and
taken
on
board
of
the
raft
with
the
intention
of
secreting
them
about
their
persons
and
resorting
to
them
in
case
of
need
the
following
morning
they
hoisted
their
sail
and
quitted
the
island
need
it
be
said
in
what
direction
they
steered
as
may
be
well
imagined
in
that
quarter
where
they
had
last
seen
the
raft
with
the
isolated
amine
the
raft
was
found
to
answer
well
and
although
her
progress
through
the
water
was
not
very
rapid
she
obeyed
the
helm
and
was
under
command
both
philip
and
krantz
were
very
careful
in
taking
such
marks
and
observations
of
the
island
as
should
enable
them
if
necessary
to
find
it
again
with
the
current
to
assist
them
they
now
proceeded
rapidly
to
the
southward
in
order
that
they
might
examine
a
large
island
which
lay
in
that
direction
their
object
after
seeking
for
amine
was
to
find
out
the
direction
of
ternate
the
king
of
which
they
knew
to
be
at
variance
with
the
portuguese
who
had
a
fort
and
factory
at
tidore
not
very
far
distant
from
it
and
from
thence
to
obtain
a
passage
in
one
of
the
chinese
junks
which
on
their
way
to
bantam
called
at
that
island
towards
evening
they
had
neared
the
large
island
and
they
soon
ran
down
it
close
to
the
beach
philip's
eyes
wandered
in
every
direction
to
ascertain
whether
anything
on
the
shore
indicated
the
presence
of
amine's
raft
but
he
could
perceive
nothing
of
the
kind
nor
did
he
see
any
inhabitants
that
they
might
not
pass
the
object
of
their
search
during
the
night
they
ran
their
raft
on
shore
in
a
small
cove
where
the
waters
were
quite
smooth
and
remained
there
until
the
next
morning
when
they
again
made
sail
and
prosecuted
their
voyage
krantz
was
steering
with
the
long
sweep
they
had
fitted
for
the
purpose
when
he
observed
philip
who
had
been
for
some
time
silent
take
from
his
breast
the
relic
which
he
wore
and
gaze
attentively
upon
it
is
that
your
picture
philip
observed
krantz
alas
no
it
is
my
destiny
replied
philip
answering
without
reflection
your
destiny
what
mean
you
did
i
say
my
destiny
i
hardly
know
what
i
said
replied
philip
replacing
the
relic
in
his
bosom
i
rather
think
you
said
more
than
you
intended
replied
krantz
but
at
the
same
time
something
near
the
truth
i
have
often
perceived
you
with
that
trinket
in
your
hand
and
i
have
not
forgotten
how
anxious
schriften
was
to
obtain
it
and
the
consequences
of
his
attempt
upon
it
is
there
not
some
secret--some
mystery
attached
to
it
surely
if
so
you
must
now
sufficiently
know
me
as
your
friend
to
feel
me
worthy
of
your
confidence
that
you
are
my
friend
krantz
i
feel
my
sincere
and
much-valued
friend
for
we
have
shared
much
danger
together
and
that
is
sufficient
to
make
us
friends
that
i
could
trust
you
i
believe
but
i
feel
as
if
i
dare
not
trust
any
one
there
is
a
mystery
attached
to
this
relic
for
a
relic
it
is
which
as
yet
has
been
confided
to
my
wife
and
holy
men
alone
and
if
trusted
to
holy
men
surely
it
may
be
trusted
to
sincere
friendship
than
which
nothing
is
more
holy
but
i
have
a
presentiment
that
the
knowledge
of
my
secret
would
prove
fatal
to
you
why
i
feel
such
a
presentiment
i
know
not
but
i
feel
it
krantz
and
i
cannot
afford
to
lose
you
my
valued
friend
you
will
not
then
make
use
of
my
friendship
it
appears
replied
krantz
i
have
risked
my
life
with
you
before
now
and
i
am
not
to
be
deterred
from
the
duties
of
friendship
by
a
childish
foreboding
on
your
part
the
result
of
an
agitated
mind
and
a
weakened
body
can
anything
be
more
absurd
than
to
suppose
that
a
secret
confided
to
me
can
be
pregnant
with
danger
unless
it
be
indeed
that
my
zeal
to
assist
you
may
lead
me
into
difficulties
i
am
not
of
a
prying
disposition
but
we
have
been
so
long
connected
together
and
are
now
so
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
world
that
it
appears
to
me
it
would
be
a
solace
to
you
were
you
to
confide
in
one
whom
you
can
trust
what
evidently
has
long
preyed
upon
your
mind
the
consolation
and
advice
of
a
friend
philip
are
not
to
be
despised
and
you
will
feel
relieved
if
able
to
talk
over
with
him
a
subject
which
evidently
oppresses
you
if
therefore
you
value
my
friendship
let
me
share
with
you
in
your
sorrows
there
are
few
who
have
passed
through
life
so
quietly
as
not
to
recollect
how
much
grief
has
been
assuaged
by
confiding
its
cause
to
and
listening
to
the
counsels
and
consolations
of
some
dear
friend
it
must
not
therefore
appear
surprising
that
situated
as
he
was
and
oppressed
with
the
loss
of
amine
philip
should
regard
krantz
as
one
to
whom
he
might
venture
to
confide
his
important
secret
he
commenced
his
narrative
with
no
injunctions
for
he
felt
that
if
krantz
could
not
respect
his
secret
for
his
secret's
sake
or
from
good
will
towards
him
he
was
not
likely
to
be
bound
by
any
promise
and
as
during
the
day
the
raft
passed
by
the
various
small
capes
and
headlands
of
the
island
he
poured
into
krantz's
ear
the
history
which
the
reader
is
acquainted
with
now
you
know
all
said
philip
with
a
deep
sigh
as
the
narrative
was
concluded
what
think
you
do
you
credit
my
strange
tale
or
do
you
imagine
as
some
well
would
that
it
is
a
mere
phantom
of
a
disordered
brain
that
it
is
not
so
philip
i
believe
replied
krantz
for
i
too
have
had
ocular
proof
of
the
correctness
of
a
part
of
your
history
remember
how
often
i
have
seen
this
phantom
ship--and
if
your
father
is
permitted
to
range
over
the
seas
why
should
you
not
be
selected
and
permitted
to
reverse
his
doom
i
fully
believe
every
word
that
you
have
told
me
and
since
you
have
told
me
this
i
can
comprehend
much
that
in
your
behaviour
at
times
appeared
unaccountable
there
are
many
who
would
pity
you
philip
but
i
envy
you
envy
me
cried
philip
yes
envy
you
and
gladly
would
i
take
the
burden
of
your
doom
on
my
own
shoulders
were
it
only
possible
is
it
not
a
splendid
thought
that
you
are
summoned
to
so
great
a
purpose--that
instead
of
roaming
through
the
world
as
we
all
do
in
pursuit
of
wealth
which
possibly
we
may
lose
after
years
of
cost
and
hardship
by
the
venture
of
a
day
and
which
at
all
events
we
must
leave
behind
us--you
are
selected
to
fulfil
a
great
and
glorious
work--the
work
of
angels
i
may
say--that
of
redeeming
the
soul
of
a
father
suffering
indeed
for
his
human
frailties
but
not
doomed
to
perish
for
eternity
you
have
indeed
an
object
of
pursuit
worthy
of
all
the
hardships
and
dangers
of
a
maritime
life
if
it
ends
in
your
death
what
then
where
else
ends
our
futile
cravings
our
continual
toil
after
nothing
we
all
must
die--but
how
few--who
indeed
besides
yourself--was
ever
permitted
before
his
death
to
ransom
the
soul
of
the
author
of
his
existence
yes
philip
i
envy
you
you
think
and
speak
like
amine
she
too
is
of
a
wild
and
ardent
soul
that
would
mingle
with
the
beings
of
the
other
world
and
hold
intelligence
with
disembodied
spirits
she
is
right
replied
krantz
there
are
events
in
my
life
or
rather
connected
with
my
family
which
have
often
fully
convinced
me
that
this
is
not
only
possible
but
permitted
your
story
has
only
corroborated
what
i
already
believed
indeed
krantz
indeed
yes
but
of
that
hereafter
the
night
is
closing
in
we
must
again
put
our
little
bark
in
safety
for
the
night
and
there
is
a
cove
which
i
think
appears
suited
for
the
purpose
before
morning
a
strong
breeze
right
on
shore
had
sprung
up
and
the
surf
became
so
high
as
to
endanger
the
raft
to
continue
their
course
was
impossible
they
could
only
haul
up
their
raft
to
prevent
its
being
dashed
to
pieces
by
the
force
of
the
waves
as
the
seas
broke
on
the
shore
philip's
thoughts
were
as
usual
upon
amine
and
as
he
watched
the
tossing
waters
as
the
sunbeams
lightened
up
their
crests
he
exclaimed
ocean
hast
thou
my
amine
if
so
give
up
thy
dead
what
is
that
continued
he
pointing
to
a
speck
on
the
horizon
the
sail
of
a
small
craft
of
some
description
or
another
replied
krantz
and
apparently
coming
down
before
the
wind
to
shelter
herself
in
the
very
nook
we
have
selected
you
are
right
it
is
the
sail
of
a
vessel--of
one
of
those
peroquas
which
skim
over
these
seas
how
she
rises
on
the
swell
she
is
full
of
men
apparently
the
peroqua
rapidly
approached
and
was
soon
close
to
the
beach
the
sail
was
lowered
and
she
was
backed
in
through
the
surf
resistance
is
useless
should
they
prove
enemies
observed
philip
we
shall
soon
know
our
fate
the
people
in
the
peroqua
took
no
notice
of
them
until
the
craft
had
been
hauled
up
and
secured
three
of
them
then
advanced
towards
philip
and
krantz
with
spears
in
their
hands
but
evidently
with
no
hostile
intentions
one
addressed
them
in
portuguese
asking
them
who
they
were
we
are
hollanders
replied
philip
a
part
of
the
crew
of
the
vessel
which
was
wrecked
inquired
he
yes
you
have
nothing
to
fear--you
are
enemies
to
the
portuguese
and
so
are
we
we
belong
to
the
island
of
ternate--our
king
is
at
war
with
the
portuguese
who
are
villains
where
are
your
companions
on
which
island
they
are
all
dead
replied
philip
may
i
ask
you
whether
you
have
fallen
in
with
a
woman
who
was
adrift
on
a
part
of
the
raft
by
herself
or
have
you
heard
of
her
we
have
heard
that
a
woman
was
picked
up
on
the
beach
to
the
southward
and
carried
away
by
the
tidore
people
to
the
portuguese
settlement
on
the
supposition
that
she
was
a
portuguese
then
god
be
thanked
she
is
saved
cried
philip
merciful
heaven
accept
my
thanks--to
tidore
you
said
yes
we
are
at
war
with
the
portuguese
we
cannot
take
you
there
no
but
we
shall
meet
again
the
person
who
accosted
them
was
evidently
of
consequence
his
dress
was
to
a
certain
degree
mahometan
but
mixed
up
with
malay
he
carried
arms
in
his
girdle
and
a
spear
in
his
hand
his
turban
was
of
printed
chintz
and
his
deportment
like
most
persons
of
rank
in
that
country
was
courteous
and
dignified
we
are
now
returning
to
ternate
and
will
take
you
with
us
our
king
will
be
pleased
to
receive
any
hollanders
especially
as
you
are
enemies
to
the
portuguese
dogs
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
we
have
one
of
your
companions
with
us
in
the
boat
we
picked
him
up
at
sea
much
exhausted
but
he
is
now
doing
well
who
can
it
be
observed
krantz
it
must
be
some
one
belonging
to
some
other
vessel
no
replied
philip
shuddering
it
must
be
schriften
then
my
eyes
must
behold
him
before
i
believe
it
replied
krantz
then
believe
your
eyes
replied
philip
pointing
to
the
form
of
schriften
who
was
now
walking
towards
them
mynheer
vanderdecken
glad
to
see
you
mynheer
krantz
i
hope
you
are
well
how
lucky
that
we
should
all
be
saved
he
he
the
ocean
has
then
indeed
given
up
its
dead
as
i
requested
thought
philip
in
the
mean
time
schriften
without
making
any
reference
to
the
way
in
which
they
had
so
unceremoniously
parted
company
addressed
krantz
with
apparent
good-humour
and
some
slight
tinge
of
sarcasm
it
was
some
time
before
krantz
could
rid
himself
of
him
what
think
you
of
him
krantz
that
he
is
a
part
of
the
whole
and
has
his
destiny
to
fulfil
as
well
as
you
he
has
his
part
to
play
in
this
wondrous
mystery
and
will
remain
until
it
is
finished
think
not
of
him
recollect
your
amine
is
safe
true
replied
philip
the
wretch
is
not
worth
a
thought
we
have
now
nothing
to
do
but
to
embark
with
these
people
hereafter
we
may
rid
ourselves
of
him
and
strive
then
to
rejoin
my
dearest
amine
when
amine
again
came
to
her
senses
she
found
herself
lying
on
the
leaves
of
the
palmetto
in
a
small
hut
a
hideous
black
child
sat
by
her
brushing
off
the
flies
where
was
she
the
raft
had
been
tossed
about
for
two
days
during
which
amine
remained
in
a
state
of
alternate
delirium
and
stupor
driven
by
the
current
and
the
gale
it
had
been
thrown
on
shore
on
the
eastern
end
of
the
coast
of
new
guinea
she
had
been
discovered
by
some
of
the
natives
who
happened
to
be
on
the
beach
trafficking
with
some
of
the
tidore
people
at
first
they
hastened
to
rid
her
of
her
garments
although
they
perceived
that
she
was
not
dead
but
before
they
had
left
her
as
naked
as
themselves
a
diamond
of
great
value
which
had
been
given
to
her
by
philip
attracted
the
attention
of
one
of
the
savages
failing
in
his
attempt
to
pull
it
off
he
pulled
out
a
rusty
blunt
knife
and
was
busily
sawing
at
the
finger
when
an
old
woman
of
authority
interfered
and
bade
him
desist
the
tidore
people
also
who
were
friends
with
the
portuguese
pointed
out
that
to
save
one
of
that
nation
would
insure
a
reward
they
stated
moreover
that
they
would
on
their
return
inform
the
people
of
the
factory
establishment
that
one
of
their
countrywomen
had
been
thrown
on
shore
on
a
raft
to
this
amine
owed
the
care
and
attention
that
was
paid
to
her
that
part
of
new
guinea
being
somewhat
civilised
by
occasional
intercourse
with
the
tidore
people
who
came
there
to
exchange
european
finery
and
trash
for
the
more
useful
productions
of
the
island
the
papoose
woman
carried
amine
into
her
hut
and
there
she
lay
for
many
days
wavering
between
life
and
death
carefully
attended
but
requiring
little
except
the
moistening
of
her
parched
lips
with
water
and
the
brushing
off
of
the
mosquitoes
and
flies
when
amine
opened
her
eyes
the
little
papoose
ran
out
to
acquaint
the
woman
who
followed
her
into
the
hut
she
was
of
large
size
very
corpulent
and
unwieldy
with
little
covering
on
her
body
her
hair
which
was
woolly
in
its
texture
was
partly
plaited
partly
frizzled
a
cloth
round
her
waist
and
a
piece
of
faded
yellow
silk
on
her
shoulders
was
all
her
dress
a
few
silver
rings
on
her
fat
fingers
and
a
necklace
of
mother-of-pearl
were
her
ornaments
her
teeth
were
jet
black
from
the
use
of
the
betel-nut
and
her
whole
appearance
was
such
as
to
excite
disgust
in
the
breast
of
amine
she
addressed
amine
but
her
words
were
unintelligible
and
the
sufferer
exhausted
with
the
slight
effort
she
had
made
fell
back
into
her
former
position
and
closed
her
eyes
but
if
the
woman
was
disgusting
she
was
kind
and
by
her
attention
and
care
amine
was
able
in
the
course
of
three
weeks
to
crawl
out
of
the
hut
and
enjoy
the
evening
breeze
the
natives
of
the
island
would
at
times
surround
her
but
they
treated
her
with
respect
from
fear
of
the
old
woman
their
woolly
hair
was
frizzled
or
plaited
sometimes
powdered
white
with
chunam
a
few
palmetto-leaves
round
the
waist
and
descending
to
the
knee
was
their
only
attire
rings
through
the
nose
and
ears
and
feathers
of
birds
particularly
the
bird
of
paradise
were
their
ornaments
but
their
language
was
wholly
unintelligible
amine
felt
grateful
for
life
she
sat
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
and
watched
the
swift
peroquas
as
they
skimmed
the
blue
sea
which
was
expanded
before
her
but
her
thoughts
were
elsewhere--they
were
on
philip
one
morning
amine
came
out
of
the
hut
with
joy
on
her
countenance
and
took
her
usual
seat
under
the
trees
yes
mother
dearest
mother
i
thank
thee
thou
hast
appeared
to
me
thou
hast
recalled
to
me
thy
arts
which
i
had
forgotten
and
had
i
but
the
means
of
conversing
with
these
people
even
now
would
i
know
where
my
philip
might
be
for
two
months
did
amine
remain
under
the
care
of
the
papoose
woman
when
the
tidore
people
returned
they
had
an
order
to
bring
the
white
woman
who
had
been
cast
on
shore
to
the
factory
and
repay
those
who
had
taken
charge
of
her
they
made
signs
to
amine
who
had
now
quite
recovered
her
beauty
that
she
was
to
go
with
them
any
change
was
preferable
to
staying
where
she
was
and
amine
followed
them
down
to
a
peroqua
on
which
she
was
securely
fixed
and
was
soon
darting
through
the
water
with
her
new
companions
and
as
they
flew
along
the
smooth
seas
amine
thought
of
philip's
dream
and
the
mermaid's
shell
by
the
evening
they
had
arrived
at
the
southern
point
of
galolo
where
they
landed
for
the
night
the
next
day
they
gained
the
place
of
their
destination
and
amine
was
led
up
to
the
portuguese
factory
that
the
curiosity
of
those
who
were
stationed
there
was
roused
is
not
to
be
wondered
at--the
history
given
by
the
natives
of
amine's
escape
appeared
so
miraculous
from
the
commandant
to
the
lowest
servant
every
one
was
waiting
to
receive
her
the
beauty
of
amine
her
perfect
form
astonished
them
the
commandant
addressed
a
long
compliment
to
her
in
portuguese
and
was
astonished
that
she
did
not
make
a
suitable
reply--but
as
amine
did
not
understand
a
word
that
he
said
it
would
have
been
more
surprising
if
she
had
as
amine
made
signs
that
she
could
not
understand
the
language
it
was
presumed
that
she
was
either
english
or
dutch
and
an
interpreter
was
sent
for
she
then
explained
that
she
was
the
wife
of
a
dutch
captain
whose
vessel
had
been
wrecked
and
that
she
did
not
know
whether
the
crew
had
been
saved
or
not
the
portuguese
were
very
glad
to
hear
that
a
dutch
vessel
had
been
wrecked
and
very
glad
that
so
lovely
a
creature
as
amine
had
been
saved
she
was
informed
by
the
commandant
that
she
was
welcome
and
that
during
her
stay
there
everything
should
be
done
to
make
her
comfortable
that
in
three
months
they
expected
a
vessel
from
the
chinese
seas
proceeding
to
goa
and
that
if
inclined
she
should
have
a
passage
to
goa
in
that
vessel
and
from
that
city
she
would
easily
find
other
vessels
to
take
her
wherever
she
might
please
to
go
she
was
then
conducted
to
an
apartment
and
left
with
a
little
negress
to
attend
upon
her
the
portuguese
commandant
was
a
small
meagre
little
man
dried
up
to
a
chip
from
long
sojourning
under
a
tropical
sun
he
had
very
large
whiskers
and
a
very
long
sword
these
were
the
two
most
remarkable
features
in
his
person
and
dress
his
attentions
could
not
be
misinterpreted
and
amine
would
have
laughed
at
him
had
she
not
been
fearful
that
she
might
be
detained
in
a
few
weeks
by
due
attention
she
gained
the
portuguese
language
so
far
as
to
ask
for
what
she
required
and
before
she
quitted
the
island
of
tidore
she
could
converse
fluently
but
her
anxiety
to
leave
and
to
ascertain
what
had
become
of
philip
became
greater
every
day
and
at
the
expiration
of
the
three
months
her
eyes
were
continually
bent
to
seaward
to
catch
the
first
glimpse
of
the
vessel
which
was
expected
at
last
it
appeared
and
as
amine
watched
the
approach
of
the
canvas
from
the
west
the
commandant
fell
on
his
knees
and
declaring
his
passion
requested
her
not
to
think
i
of
departure
but
to
unite
her
fate
with
his
amine
was
cautious
in
her
reply
for
she
knew
that
she
was
in
his
power
she
must
first
receive
intelligence
of
her
husband's
death
which
was
not
yet
certain
she
would
proceed
to
goa
and
if
she
discovered
that
she
was
single
she
would
write
to
him
this
answer
as
it
will
be
discovered
was
the
cause
of
great
suffering
to
philip
the
commandant
fully
assured
that
he
could
compass
philip's
death
was
satisfied--declared
that
as
soon
as
he
had
any
positive
intelligence
he
would
bring
it
to
goa
himself
and
made
a
thousand
protestations
of
truth
and
fidelity
fool
thought
amine
as
she
watched
the
ship
which
was
now
close
to
the
anchorage
in
half
an
hour
the
vessel
had
anchored
and
the
people
had
landed
amine
observed
a
priest
with
them
as
they
walked
up
to
the
fort
she
shuddered--she
knew
not
why
when
they
arrived
she
found
herself
in
the
presence
of
father
mathias
both
amine
and
father
mathias
started
and
drew
back
with
surprise
at
this
unexpected
meeting
amine
was
the
first
to
extend
her
hand
she
had
almost
forgotten
at
the
moment
how
they
had
parted
in
the
pleasure
she
experienced
in
meeting
with
a
well-known
face
father
mathias
coldly
took
her
hand
and
laying
his
own
upon
her
head
said
may
god
bless
thee
and
forgive
thee
my
daughter
as
i
have
long
done
then
the
recollection
of
what
had
passed
rushed
into
amine's
mind
and
she
coloured
deeply
had
father
mathias
forgiven
her
the
event
would
show
but
this
is
certain
he
now
treated
her
as
an
old
friend
listened
with
interest
to
her
history
of
the
wreck
and
agreed
with
her
upon
the
propriety
of
her
accompanying
him
to
goa
in
a
few
days
the
vessel
sailed
and
amine
quitted
the
factory
and
its
enamoured
commandant
they
ran
through
the
archipelago
in
safety
and
were
crossing
the
mouth
of
the
bay
of
bengal
without
having
had
any
interruption
to
fine
weather
father
mathias
had
returned
to
lisbon
when
he
quitted
ternicore
and
tired
of
idleness
had
again
volunteered
to
proceed
as
a
missionary
to
india
he
had
arrived
at
formosa
and
shortly
after
his
arrival
had
received
directions
from
his
superior
to
return
on
important
business
to
goa
and
thus
it
was
that
he
fell
in
with
amine
at
tidore
it
would
be
difficult
to
analyse
the
feelings
of
father
mathias
towards
amine--they
varied
so
often
at
one
moment
he
would
call
to
mind
the
kindness
shown
to
him
by
her
and
philip
the
regard
he
had
for
the
husband
and
the
many
good
qualities
which
he
acknowledged
that
she
possessed
and
now
he
would
recollect
the
disgrace
the
unmerited
disgrace
he
had
suffered
through
her
means
and
he
would
then
canvass
whether
she
really
did
believe
him
an
intruder
in
her
chamber
for
other
motives
than
those
which
actuated
him
or
whether
she
had
taken
advantage
of
his
indiscretion
these
accounts
were
nearly
balanced
in
his
mind
he
could
have
forgiven
all
if
he
had
thought
that
amine
was
a
sincere
convert
to
the
church
but
his
strong
conviction
that
she
was
not
only
an
unbeliever
but
that
she
practised
forbidden
arts
turned
the
scale
against
her
he
watched
her
narrowly
and
when
in
her
conversation
she
showed
any
religious
feeling
his
heart
warmed
towards
her
but
when
on
the
contrary
any
words
escaped
her
lips
which
seemed
to
show
that
she
thought
lightly
of
his
creed
then
the
full
tide
of
indignation
and
vengeance
poured
into
his
bosom
it
was
in
crossing
the
bay
of
bengal
to
pass
round
the
southern
cape
of
ceylon
that
they
first
met
with
bad
weather
and
when
the
storm
increased
the
superstitious
seamen
lighted
candles
before
the
small
image
of
the
saint
which
was
shrined
on
deck
amine
observed
it
and
smiled
with
scorn
and
as
she
did
so
almost
unwittingly
she
perceived
that
the
eye
of
father
mathias
was
earnestly
fixed
upon
her
the
papooses
i
have
just
left
do
no
worse
than
worship
their
idols
and
are
termed
idolaters
muttered
amine
what
then
are
these
christians
would
you
not
be
better
below
said
father
mathias
coming
over
to
amine
this
is
no
time
for
women
to
be
on
deck
they
would
be
better
employed
in
offering
up
prayers
for
safety
nay
father
i
can
pray
better
here
i
like
this
conflict
of
the
elements
and
as
i
view
i
bow
down
in
admiration
of
the
deity
who
rules
the
storm--who
sends
the
winds
forth
in
their
wrath
or
soothes
them
into
peace
it
is
well
said
my
child
replied
father
mathias
but
the
almighty
is
not
only
to
be
worshipped
in
his
works
but
in
the
closet
with
meditation
self-examination
and
faith
hast
thou
followed
up
the
precepts
which
thou
hast
been
taught--hast
thou
reverenced
the
sublime
mysteries
which
have
been
unfolded
to
thee
i
have
done
my
best
father
replied
amine
turning
away
her
head
and
watching
the
rolling
wave
hast
thou
called
upon
the
holy
virgin
and
upon
the
saints--those
intercessors
for
mortals
erring
like
thyself
amine
made
no
answer
she
did
not
wish
to
irritate
the
priest
neither
would
she
tell
an
untruth
answer
me
child
continued
the
priest
with
severity
father
replied
amine
i
have
appealed
to
god
alone--the
god
of
the
christians--the
god
of
the
whole
universe
who
believes
not
everything
believes
nothing
young
woman
i
thought
as
much
i
saw
thee
smile
with
scorn
just
now
why
didst
thou
smile
at
my
own
thoughts
good
father
say
rather
at
the
true
faith
shown
by
others
amine
made
no
answer
thou
art
still
an
unbeliever
and
a
heretic
beware
young
woman--
beware
beware
of
what
good
father
why
should
i
beware
are
there
not
millions
in
these
climes
more
unbelieving
and
more
heretic
perhaps
than
i
how
many
have
you
converted
to
your
faith
what
trouble
what
toil
what
dangers
have
you
not
undergone
to
propagate
that
creed
and
why
do
you
succeed
so
ill
shall
i
tell
you
father
it
is
because
the
people
have
already
had
a
creed
of
their
own--a
creed
taught
to
them
from
their
infancy
and
acknowledged
by
all
who
live
about
them
am
i
not
in
the
same
position
i
was
brought
up
in
another
creed
and
can
you
expect
that
that
can
be
dismissed
and
the
prejudices
of
early
years
at
once
eradicated
i
have
thought
much
of
what
you
have
told
me--have
felt
that
much
is
true--that
the
tenets
of
your
creed
are
godlike
is
not
that
much
and
yet
you
are
not
content
you
would
have
blind
acknowledgment
blind
obedience
i
were
then
an
unworthy
convert
we
shall
soon
be
in
port
then
teach
me
and
convince
me
if
you
will
i
am
ready
to
examine
and
confess
but
on
conviction
only
have
patience
good
father
and
the
time
may
come
when
i
may
feel
what
now
i
do
not--that
yon
bit
of
painted
wood
is
a
thing
to
bow
down
to
and
adore
notwithstanding
this
taunt
at
the
close
of
this
speech
there
was
so
much
truth
in
the
observations
of
amine
that
father
mathias
felt
their
power
as
the
wife
of
a
catholic
he
had
been
accustomed
to
view
amine
as
one
who
had
backslided
from
the
church
of
rome--not
as
one
who
had
been
brought
up
in
another
creed
he
now
recalled
to
mind
that
she
had
never
yet
been
received
into
the
church
for
father
seysen
had
not
considered
her
as
in
a
proper
state
to
be
admitted
and
had
deferred
her
baptism
until
he
was
satisfied
of
her
full
belief
you
speak
boldly
but
you
speak
as
you
feel
my
child
replied
father
mathias
after
a
pause
we
will
when
we
arrive
at
goa
talk
over
these
things
and
with
the
blessing
of
god
the
new
faith
shall
be
made
manifest
to
you
so
be
it
replied
amine
little
did
the
priest
imagine
that
amine's
thoughts
were
at
that
moment
upon
a
dream
she
had
had
at
new
guinea
in
which
her
mother
appeared
and
revealed
to
her
her
magic
arts
and
that
amine
was
longing
to
arrive
at
goa
that
she
might
practise
them
every
hour
the
gale
increased
and
the
vessel
laboured
and
leaked
the
portuguese
sailors
were
frightened
and
invoked
their
saints
father
mathias
and
the
other
passengers
gave
themselves
up
for
lost
for
the
pumps
could
not
keep
the
vessel
free
and
their
cheeks
blanched
as
the
waves
washed
furiously
over
the
vessel
they
prayed
and
trembled
father
mathias
gave
them
absolution
some
cried
like
children
some
tore
their
hair
some
cursed
and
cursed
the
saints
they
had
but
the
day
before
invoked
but
amine
stood
unmoved
and
as
she
heard
them
curse
she
smiled
in
scorn
my
child
said
father
mathias
checking
his
tremulous
voice
that
he
might
not
appear
agitated
before
one
whom
he
saw
so
calm
and
unmoved
amidst
the
roaring
of
the
elements--my
child
let
not
this
hour
of
peril
pass
away
before
thou
art
summoned
let
me
receive
thee
into
the
bosom
of
our
church--give
thee
pardon
for
thy
sins
and
certainty
of
bliss
hereafter
good
father
amine
is
not
to
be
frightened
into
belief
even
if
she
feared
the
storm
replied
she
nor
will
she
credit
your
power
to
forgive
her
sins
merely
because
she
says
in
fear
that
which
in
her
calm
reason
she
might
reject
if
ever
fear
could
have
subjected
me
it
was
when
i
was
alone
upon
the
raft--that
was
indeed
a
trial
of
my
strength
of
mind
the
bare
recollection
of
which
is
at
this
moment
more
dreadful
than
the
storm
now
raging
and
the
death
which
may
await
us
there
is
a
god
on
high
in
whose
mercy
i
trust--in
whose
love
i
confide--
to
whose
will
i
bow
let
him
do
his
will
die
not
my
child
in
unbelief
father
replied
amine
pointing
to
the
passengers
and
seamen
who
were
on
the
deck
crying
and
wailing
these
are
christians--these
men
have
been
promised
by
you
but
now
the
inheritance
of
perfect
bliss
what
is
their
faith
that
it
does
not
give
them
strength
to
die
like
men
why
is
it
that
a
woman
quails
not
while
they
lie
grovelling
on
the
deck
life
is
sweet
my
child--they
leave
their
wives
their
children
and
they
dread
hereafter
who
is
prepared
to
die
i
am
replied
amine
i
have
no
husband--at
least
i
fear
i
have
no
husband
for
me
life
has
no
sweets
yet
one
little
hope
remains--a
straw
to
the
sinking
wretch
i
fear
not
death
for
i
have
nought
to
live
for
were
philip
here
why
then
indeed--but
he
is
gone
before
me
and
now
to
follow
him
is
all
i
ask
he
died
in
the
faith
my
child--if
you
would
meet
him
do
the
same
he
never
died
like
these
replied
amine
looking
with
scorn
at
the
passengers
perhaps
he
lived
not
as
they
have
lived
replied
father
mathias
a
good
man
dies
in
peace
and
hath
no
fear
so
die
the
good
men
of
all
creeds
father
replied
amine
and
in
all
creeds
death
is
equally
terrible
to
the
wicked
i
will
pray
for
thee
my
child
said
father
mathias
sinking
on
his
knees
many
thanks--thy
prayers
will
be
heard
even
though
offered
for
one
like
me
replied
amine
who
clinging
to
the
man-ropes
made
her
way
up
to
the
ladder
and
gained
the
deck
lost
signora
lost
exclaimed
the
captain
wringing
his
hands
as
he
crouched
under
the
bulwark
no
replied
amine
who
had
gained
the
weather
side
and
held
on
by
a
rope
not
lost
this
time
how
say
you
signora
replied
the
captain
looking
with
admiration
at
amine's
calm
and
composed
countenance
how
say
you
signora
something
tells
me
good
captain
that
you
will
not
be
lost
if
you
exert
yourselves--something
tells
it
to
me
here
and
amine
laid
her
hand
to
her
heart
amine
had
a
conviction
that
the
vessel
would
not
be
lost
for
it
had
not
escaped
her
observation
that
the
storm
was
less
violent
although
in
their
terror
this
had
been
unnoticed
by
the
sailors
the
coolness
of
amine
her
beauty
perhaps
the
unusual
sight
of
a
woman
so
young
calm
and
confiding
when
all
others
were
in
despair
had
its
due
effect
upon
the
captain
and
sea
men
supposing
her
to
be
a
catholic
they
imagined
that
she
had
had
some
warrant
for
her
assertion
for
credulity
and
superstition
are
close
friends
they
looked
upon
amine
with
admiration
and
respect
recovered
their
energies
and
applied
to
their
duties
the
pumps
were
again
worked
the
storm
abated
during
the
night
and
the
vessel
was
as
amine
had
predicted
saved
the
crew
and
passengers
looked
upon
her
almost
as
a
saint
and
talked
of
her
to
father
mathias
who
was
sadly
perplexed
the
courage
which
she
had
displayed
was
extraordinary
even
when
he
trembled
she
showed
no
sign
of
fear
he
made
no
reply
but
communed
with
his
own
mind
and
the
result
was
unfavourable
to
amine
what
had
given
her
such
coolness
what
had
given
her
the
spirit
of
prophecy
not
the
god
of
the
christians
for
she
was
no
believer
who
then
and
father
mathias
thought
of
her
chamber
at
terneuse
and
shook
his
head
we
must
now
again
return
to
philip
and
krantz
who
had
a
long
conversation
upon
the
strange
reappearance
of
schriften
all
that
they
could
agree
upon
was
that
he
should
be
carefully
watched
and
that
they
should
dispense
with
his
company
as
soon
as
possible
krantz
had
interrogated
him
as
to
his
escape
and
schriften
had
informed
him
in
his
usual
sneering
manner
that
one
of
the
sweeps
of
the
raft
had
been
allowed
to
get
adrift
during
the
scuffle
and
that
he
had
floated
on
it
until
he
had
gained
a
small
island
that
on
seeing
the
peroqua
he
had
once
more
launched
it
and
supported
himself
by
it
until
he
was
perceived
and
picked
up
as
there
was
nothing
impossible
although
much
of
the
improbable
in
this
account
krantz
asked
no
more
questions
the
next
morning
the
wind
having
abated
they
launched
the
peroqua
and
made
sail
for
the
island
of
ternate
it
was
four
days
before
they
arrived
as
every
night
they
landed
and
hauled
up
their
craft
on
the
sandy
beach
philip's
heart
was
relieved
at
the
knowledge
of
amine's
safety
and
he
could
have
been
happy
at
the
prospect
of
again
meeting
her
had
he
not
been
so
constantly
fretted
by
the
company
of
schriften
there
was
something
so
strange
so
contrary
to
human
nature
that
the
little
man
though
diabolical
as
he
appeared
to
be
in
his
disposition
should
never
hint
at
or
complain
of
philip's
attempts
upon
his
life
had
he
complained--had
he
accused
philip
of
murder--had
he
vowed
vengeance
and
demanded
justice
on
his
return
to
the
authorities
it
had
been
different--but
no--there
he
was
making
his
uncalled-for
and
impertinent
observations
with
his
eternal
chuckle
and
sarcasm
as
if
he
had
not
the
least
cause
of
anger
or
ill-will
as
soon
as
they
arrived
at
the
principal
port
and
town
of
ternate
they
were
conducted
to
a
large
cabin
built
of
palmetto
leaves
and
bamboo
and
requested
not
to
leave
it
until
their
arrival
had
been
announced
to
the
king
the
peculiar
courtesy
and
good
breeding
of
these
islanders
was
the
constant
theme
of
remark
of
philip
and
krantz
their
religion
as
well
as
their
dress
appeared
to
be
a
compound
of
the
mahometan
and
malayan
after
a
few
hours
they
were
summoned
to
attend
the
audience
of
the
king
held
in
the
open
air
the
king
was
seated
under
a
portico
attended
by
a
numerous
concourse
of
priests
and
soldiers
there
was
much
company
but
little
splendour
all
who
were
about
the
king
were
robed
in
white
with
white
turbans
but
he
himself
was
without
ornament
the
first
thing
that
struck
philip
and
krantz
when
they
were
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
king
was
the
beautiful
cleanliness
which
everywhere
prevailed
every
dress
was
spotless
and
white
as
the
sun
could
bleach
it
having
followed
the
example
of
those
who
introduced
them
and
saluted
the
king
after
the
mahometan
custom
they
were
requested
to
be
seated
and
through
the
portuguese
interpreters--for
the
former
communication
of
the
islanders
with
the
portuguese
who
had
been
driven
from
the
place
made
the
portuguese
language
well
known
by
many--a
few
questions
were
put
by
the
king
who
bade
them
welcome
and
then
requested
to
know
how
they
had
been
wrecked
philip
entered
into
a
short
detail
in
which
he
stated
that
his
wife
had
been
separated
from
him
and
was
he
understood
in
the
hands
of
the
portuguese
factory
at
tidore
he
requested
to
know
if
his
majesty
could
assist
him
in
obtaining
her
release
or
in
going
to
join
her
it
is
well
said
replied
the
king
let
refreshments
be
brought
in
for
the
strangers
and
the
audience
be
broken
up
in
a
few
minutes
there
remained
of
all
the
court
but
two
or
three
of
the
king's
confidential
friends
and
advisers
and
a
collation
of
curries
fish
and
a
variety
of
other
dishes
was
served
up
after
it
was
over
the
king
then
said
the
portuguese
are
dogs
they
are
our
enemies--will
you
assist
us
to
fight
them
we
have
large
guns
but
do
not
understand
the
use
of
them
as
well
as
you
do
i
will
send
a
fleet
against
the
portuguese
at
tidore
if
you
will
assist
me
say
hollanders
will
you
fight
you
addressing
philip
will
then
recover
your
wife
i
will
give
an
answer
to
you
to-morrow
replied
philip
i
must
consult
with
my
friend
as
i
told
you
before
i
was
the
captain
of
the
ship
and
this
was
my
second
in
command--we
will
consult
together
schriften
whom
philip
had
represented
as
a
common
seaman
had
not
been
brought
up
into
the
presence
of
the
king
it
is
good
replied
the
king
to-morrow
we
will
expect
your
reply
philip
and
krantz
took
their
leave
and
on
their
return
to
the
cabin
found
that
the
king
had
sent
them
as
a
present
two
complete
mahometan
dresses
with
turbans
these
were
welcome
for
their
own
garments
were
sadly
tattered
and
very
unfit
for
exposure
to
the
burning
sun
of
those
climes
their
peaked
hats
too
collected
the
rays
of
heat
which
were
intolerable
and
they
gladly
exchanged
them
for
the
white
turban
secreting
their
money
in
the
malayan
sash
which
formed
a
part
of
the
attire
they
soon
robed
themselves
in
the
native
garments
the
comfort
of
which
was
immediately
acknowledged
after
a
long
consultation
it
was
decided
that
they
should
accept
the
terms
offered
by
the
king
as
this
was
the
only
feasible
way
by
which
philip
could
hope
to
re-obtain
possession
of
amine
their
consent
was
communicated
to
the
king
on
the
following
day
and
every
preparation
was
made
for
the
expedition
and
now
was
to
be
beheld
a
scene
of
bustle
and
activity
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
peroquas
of
every
dimension
floating
close
to
the
beach
side
by
side
formed
a
raft
extending
nearly
half
a
mile
on
the
smooth
water
of
the
bay
teeming
with
men
who
were
equipping
them
for
the
service
some
were
fitting
the
sails
others
were
carpentering
where
required
the
major
portion
were
sharpening
their
swords
and
preparing
the
deadly
poison
of
the
pine-apple
for
their
creeses
the
beach
was
a
scene
of
confusion
water
in
jars
bags
of
rice
vegetables
salt-fish
fowls
in
coops
were
everywhere
strewed
about
among
the
armed
natives
who
were
obeying
the
orders
of
the
chiefs
who
themselves
walked
up
and
down
dressed
in
their
gayest
apparel
and
glittering
in
their
arms
and
ornaments
the
king
had
six
long
brass
four-pounders
a
present
from
an
indian
captain
these
with
a
proportionate
quantity
of
shot
and
cartridges
were
under
the
direction
of
philip
and
krantz
fitted
on
some
of
the
largest
peroquas
and
some
of
the
natives
were
instructed
how
to
use
them
at
first
the
king
who
fully
expected
the
reduction
of
the
portuguese
fort
stated
his
determination
to
go
in
person
but
in
this
he
was
overruled
by
his
confidential
advisers
and
by
the
request
of
philip
who
could
not
allow
him
to
expose
his
valuable
life
in
ten
days
all
was
ready
and
the
fleet
manned
by
seven
thousand
men
made
sail
for
the
island
of
tidore
it
was
a
beautiful
sight
to
behold
the
blue
rippling
sea
covered
with
nearly
six
hundred
of
these
picturesque
craft
all
under
sail
and
darting
through
the
water
like
dolphins
in
pursuit
of
prey
all
crowded
with
natives
whose
white
dresses
formed
a
lively
contrast
with
the
deep
blue
of
the
water
the
large
peroquas
in
which
were
philip
and
krantz
with
the
native
commanders
were
gaily
decorated
with
streamers
and
pennons
of
all
colours
that
flowed
out
and
snapped
with
the
fresh
breeze
it
appeared
rather
to
be
an
expedition
of
mirth
and
merriment
than
one
which
was
proceeding
to
bloodshed
and
slaughter
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
they
had
made
the
island
of
tidore
and
run
down
to
within
a
few
miles
of
the
portuguese
factory
and
fort
the
natives
of
the
country
who
disliked
though
they
feared
to
disobey
the
portuguese
had
quitted
their
huts
near
the
beach
and
retired
into
the
woods
the
fleet
therefore
anchored
and
lay
near
the
beach
without
molestation
during
the
night
the
next
morning
philip
and
krantz
proceeded
to
reconnoitre
the
port
and
factory
of
tidore
were
built
upon
the
same
principle
as
almost
all
the
portuguese
defences
in
those
seas
an
outer
fortification
consisting
of
a
ditch
with
strong
palisades
embedded
in
masonry
surrounded
the
factory
and
all
the
houses
of
the
establishment
the
gates
of
the
outer
wall
were
open
all
day
for
ingress
and
egress
and
closed
only
at
night
on
the
seaward
side
of
this
enclosure
was
what
may
be
termed
the
citadel
or
real
fortification
it
was
built
of
solid
masonry
with
parapets
was
surrounded
by
a
deep
ditch
and
was
only
accessible
by
a
drawbridge
mounted
with
cannon
on
every
side
its
real
strength
however
could
not
well
be
perceived
as
it
was
hidden
by
the
high
palisading
which
surrounded
the
whole
establishment
after
a
careful
survey
philip
recommended
that
the
large
peroquas
with
the
cannon
should
attack
by
sea
while
the
men
of
the
small
vessels
should
land
and
surround
the
fort
taking
advantage
of
every
shelter
which
was
afforded
them
to
cover
themselves
while
they
harassed
the
enemy
with
their
matchlocks
arrows
and
spears
this
plan
having
been
approved
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
peroquas
made
sail
the
others
were
hauled
on
the
beach
and
the
men
belonging
to
them
proceeded
by
land
but
the
portuguese
had
been
warned
of
their
approach
and
were
fully
prepared
to
receive
them
the
guns
mounted
to
the
seaward
were
of
heavy
calibre
and
well
served
the
guns
of
the
peroquas
though
rendered
as
effectual
as
they
could
be
under
the
direction
of
philip
were
small
and
did
little
damage
to
the
thick
stone
front
of
the
fort
after
an
engagement
of
four
hours
during
which
the
ternate
people
lost
a
great
number
of
men
the
peroquas
by
the
advice
of
philip
and
krantz
hauled
off
and
returned
to
where
the
remainder
of
the
fleet
was
stationed
and
another
council
of
war
was
held
the
force
which
had
surrounded
the
fort
on
the
land
side
was
however
not
withdrawn
as
it
cut
off
any
supplies
or
assistance
and
at
the
same
time
occasionally
brought
down
any
of
the
portuguese
who
might
expose
themselves--a
point
of
no
small
importance
as
philip
well
knew
with
a
garrison
so
small
as
that
in
the
fort
that
they
could
not
take
the
fort
by
means
of
their
cannon
was
evident
on
the
sea
side
it
was
for
them
impregnable
their
efforts
must
now
be
directed
to
the
land
krantz
after
the
native
chiefs
had
done
speaking
advised
that
they
should
wait
until
dark
and
then
proceed
to
the
attack
in
the
following
way
when
the
breeze
set
along
shore
which
it
would
do
in
the
evening
he
proposed
that
the
men
should
prepare
large
bundles
of
dry
palmetto
and
cocoa-nut
leaves
that
they
should
carry
their
bundles
and
stack
them
against
the
palisades
to
windward
and
then
set
fire
to
them
they
would
thus
burn
down
the
palisades
and
gain
an
entrance
into
the
outer
fortification
after
which
they
could
ascertain
in
what
manner
they
should
next
proceed
this
advice
was
too
judicious
not
to
be
followed
all
the
men
who
had
not
matchlocks
were
set
to
collect
fagots
a
large
quantity
of
dry
wood
was
soon
got
together
and
before
night
they
were
ready
for
the
second
attack
the
white
dresses
of
the
ternates
were
laid
aside
with
nothing
on
them
but
their
belts
and
scimitars
and
creeses
and
blue
under-drawers
they
silently
crept
up
to
the
palisades
there
deposited
their
fagots
and
then
again
returned
again
to
perform
the
same
journey
as
the
breastwork
of
fagots
increased
so
did
they
more
boldly
walk
up
until
the
pile
was
completed
they
then
with
a
loud
shout
fired
it
in
several
places
the
flames
mounted
the
cannon
of
the
fort
roared
and
many
fell
under
the
discharges
of
grape
and
hand-grenade
but
stifled
by
the
smoke
which
poured
in
volumes
upon
them
the
people
in
the
fort
were
soon
compelled
to
quit
the
ramparts
to
avoid
suffocation
the
palisades
were
on
fire
and
the
flames
mounting
in
the
air
swept
over
and
began
to
attack
the
factory
and
houses
no
resistance
was
now
offered
and
the
ternates
tore
down
the
burning
palisades
and
forced
their
way
into
the
intrenchment
and
with
their
scimitars
and
creeses
put
to
death
all
who
had
been
so
unfortunate
as
not
to
take
refuge
in
the
citadel
these
were
chiefly
native
servants
whom
the
attack
had
surprised
and
for
whose
lives
the
portuguese
seemed
to
care
but
little
for
they
paid
no
attention
to
their
cries
to
lower
the
drawbridge
and
admit
them
into
the
fort
the
factory
built
of
stone
and
all
the
other
houses
were
on
fire
and
the
island
was
lighted
up
for
miles
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
and
the
defences
of
the
fort
were
now
plainly
visible
in
the
broad
glare
of
the
flames
if
we
had
scaling-ladders
cried
philip
the
fort
would
be
ours
there
is
not
a
soul
on
the
ramparts
true
true
replied
krantz
but
even
as
it
is
the
factory
walls
will
prove
an
advantageous
post
for
us
after
the
fire
is
extinguished
if
we
occupy
it
we
can
prevent
them
showing
themselves
while
the
ladders
are
constructing
to-morrow
night
we
may
have
them
ready
and
having
first
smoked
the
fort
with
a
few
more
fagots
we
may
afterwards
mount
the
walls
and
carry
the
place
that
will
do
replied
philip
as
he
walked
away
he
then
joined
the
native
chiefs
who
were
collected
together
outside
of
the
intrenchment
and
communicated
to
them
his
plans
when
he
had
made
known
his
views
and
the
chiefs
had
assented
to
them
schriften
who
had
come
with
the
expedition
unknown
to
philip
made
his
appearance
that
won't
do
you'll
never
take
that
fort
philip
vanderdecken
he
he
cried
schriften
hardly
had
he
said
the
words
when
a
tremendous
explosion
took
place
and
the
air
was
filled
with
large
stones
which
flew
and
fell
in
every
direction
killing
and
maiming
hundreds
it
was
the
factory
which
had
blown
up
for
in
its
vaults
there
was
a
large
quantity
of
gunpowder
to
which
the
fire
had
communicated
so
ends
that
scheme
mynheer
vanderdecken
he
he
screamed
schriften
you'll
never
take
that
fort
the
loss
of
life
and
the
confusion
caused
by
this
unexpected
result
occasioned
a
panic
and
all
the
ternate
people
fled
down
to
the
beach
where
their
peroquas
were
lying
it
was
in
vain
that
philip
and
their
chiefs
attempted
to
rally
them
unaccustomed
to
the
terrible
effects
of
gunpowder
in
any
large
quantities
they
believed
that
something
supernatural
had
occurred
and
many
of
them
jumped
into
the
peroquas
and
made
sail
while
the
remainder
were
confused
trembling
and
panting
all
huddled
together
on
the
beach
you'll
never
take
that
fort
mynheer
vanderdecken
screamed
the
well-known
voice
philip
raised
his
sword
to
cleave
the
little
man
in
two
but
he
let
it
fall
again
i
fear
he
tells
an
unwelcome
truth
thought
philip
but
why
should
i
take
his
life
for
that
some
few
of
the
ternate
chiefs
still
kept
up
their
courage
but
the
major
part
were
as
much
alarmed
as
their
people
after
some
consultation
it
was
agreed
that
the
army
should
remain
where
it
was
till
the
next
morning
when
they
should
finally
decide
what
to
do
when
the
day
dawned
now
that
the
portuguese
fort
was
no
longer
surrounded
by
the
other
buildings
they
perceived
that
it
was
more
formidable
than
they
had
at
first
supposed
the
ramparts
were
filled
with
men
and
they
were
bringing
cannon
to
bear
on
the
ternate
forces
philip
had
a
consultation
with
krantz
and
both
acknowledged
that
with
the
present
panic
nothing
more
could
be
done
the
chiefs
were
of
the
same
opinion
and
orders
were
given
for
the
return
of
the
expedition
indeed
the
ternate
chiefs
were
fully
satisfied
with
their
success
they
had
destroyed
the
large
fort
the
factory
and
all
the
portuguese
buildings
a
small
fortification
only
was
uninjured
that
was
built
of
stone
and
inaccessible
and
they
knew
that
the
report
of
what
had
been
done
would
be
taken
and
acknowledged
by
the
king
as
a
great
victory
the
order
was
therefore
given
for
embarkation
and
in
two
hours
the
whole
fleet
after
a
loss
of
about
seven
hundred
men
was
again
on
its
way
to
ternate
krantz
and
philip
this
time
embarked
in
the
same
peroqua
that
they
might
have
the
pleasure
of
each
other's
conversation
they
had
not
however
sailed
above
three
hours
when
it
fell
calm
and
towards
the
evening
there
was
every
prospect
of
bad
weather
when
the
breeze
again
sprung
up
it
was
from
an
adverse
quarter
but
these
vessels
steer
so
close
to
the
wind
that
this
was
disregarded
by
midnight
however
the
wind
had
increased
to
a
gale
and
before
they
were
clear
of
the
ne
headland
of
tidore
it
blew
a
hurricane
and
many
were
washed
off
into
the
sea
from
the
different
craft
and
those
who
could
not
swim
sank
and
were
drowned
the
sails
were
lowered
and
the
vessels
lay
at
the
mercy
of
the
wind
and
waves
every
sea
washing
over
them
the
fleet
was
drifting
fast
on
the
shore
and
before
morning
dawned
the
vessel
in
which
were
philip
and
krantz
was
among
the
rollers
on
the
beach
off
the
northern
end
of
the
island
in
a
short
time
she
was
dashed
to
pieces
and
every
one
had
to
look
out
for
himself
philip
and
krantz
laid
hold
of
one
fragment
and
were
supported
by
it
till
they
gained
the
shore
here
they
found
about
thirty
more
companions
who
had
suffered
the
same
fate
as
themselves
when
the
day
dawned
they
perceived
that
the
major
part
of
the
fleet
had
weathered
the
point
and
that
those
who
had
not
would
in
all
probability
escape
as
the
wind
had
moderated
the
ternate
people
proposed
that
as
they
were
well
armed
they
should
as
soon
as
the
weather
moderated
launch
some
of
the
craft
belonging
to
the
islanders
and
join
the
fleet
but
philip
who
had
been
consulting
with
krantz
considered
this
a
good
opportunity
for
ascertaining
the
fate
of
amine
as
the
portuguese
could
prove
nothing
against
them
they
could
either
deny
that
they
had
been
among
the
assailants
or
might
plead
that
they
had
been
forced
to
join
them
at
all
risks
philip
was
determined
to
remain
and
krantz
agreed
to
share
his
fate
and
seeming
to
agree
with
them
they
allowed
the
ternate
people
to
walk
to
the
tidore
peroquas
and
while
they
were
launching
them
philip
and
krantz
fell
back
into
the
jungle
and
disappeared
the
portuguese
had
perceived
the
wreck
of
their
enemies
and
irritated
by
the
loss
they
had
sustained
they
had
ordered
the
people
of
the
island
to
go
out
and
capture
all
who
were
driven
on
shore
now
that
they
were
no
longer
assailed
the
tidore
people
obeyed
them
and
very
soon
fell
in
with
philip
and
krantz
who
had
quietly
sat
down
under
the
shade
of
a
large
tree
waiting
the
issue
they
were
led
away
to
the
fort
where
they
arrived
by
nightfall
they
were
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
commandant
the
same
little
man
who
had
made
love
to
amine
and
as
they
were
dressed
in
mussulman's
attire
he
was
about
to
order
them
to
be
hung
when
philip
told
him
that
they
were
dutchmen
who
had
been
wrecked
and
forced
by
the
king
of
ternate
to
join
his
expedition
that
they
had
taken
the
earliest
opportunity
of
escaping
as
was
very
evident
since
those
who
had
been
thrown
on
shore
with
them
had
got
off
in
the
island
boats
while
they
chose
to
remain
whereupon
the
little
portuguese
commandant
struck
his
sword
firm
down
on
the
pavement
of
the
ramparts
looked
very
big
and
then
ordered
them
to
prison
for
further
examination
as
every
one
descants
upon
the
want
of
comfort
in
a
prison
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
there
are
no
very
comfortable
ones
certainly
that
to
which
philip
and
krantz
were
ushered
had
anything
rather
than
the
air
of
an
agreeable
residence
it
was
under
the
fort
with
a
very
small
aperture
looking
towards
the
sea
for
light
and
air
it
was
very
hot
and
moreover
destitute
of
all
those
little
conveniences
which
add
so
much
to
one's
happiness
in
modern
houses
and
hotels
in
fact
it
consisted
of
four
bare
walls
and
a
stone
floor
and
that
was
all
philip
who
wished
to
make
some
inquiries
relative
to
amine
addressed
in
portuguese
the
soldier
who
brought
them
down
my
good
friend
i
beg
your
pardon--
i
beg
yours
replied
the
soldier
going
out
of
the
door
and
locking
them
in
philip
leant
gloomily
against
the
wall
krantz
more
mercurial
walked
up
and
down
three
steps
each
way
and
turn
do
you
know
what
i
am
thinking
of
observed
krantz
after
a
pause
in
his
walk
it
is
very
fortunate
that
lowering
his
voice
we
have
all
our
doubloons
about
us
if
they
don't
search
us
we
may
yet
get
away
by
bribing
and
i
was
thinking
rejoined
philip
that
i
would
sooner
be
here
than
in
company
with
that
wretch
schriften
whose
sight
is
poison
to
me
i
did
not
much
admire
the
appearance
of
the
commandant
but
i
suppose
we
shall
know
more
to-morrow
here
they
were
interrupted
by
the
turning
of
the
key
and
the
entrance
of
a
soldier
with
a
chatty
of
water
and
a
large
dish
of
boiled
rice
he
was
not
the
man
who
had
brought
them
to
the
dungeon
and
philip
accosted
him
you
have
had
hard
work
within
these
last
two
days
yes
indeed
signor
the
natives
forced
us
to
join
the
expedition
and
we
escaped
so
i
heard
you
say
signor
they
lost
nearly
a
thousand
men
said
krantz
holy
st
francis
i
am
glad
of
it
they
will
be
careful
how
they
attack
portuguese
in
a
hurry
i
expect
rejoined
krantz
i
think
so
replied
the
soldier
did
you
lose
many
men
ventured
philip
perceiving
that
the
man
was
loquacious
not
ten
of
our
own
people
in
the
factory
there
were
about
a
hundred
of
the
natives
with
some
women
and
children
but
that
is
of
no
consequence
you
had
a
young
european
woman
here
i
understand
said
philip
with
anxiety
one
who
was
wrecked
in
a
vessel--was
she
among
those
who
were
lost
young
woman--holy
st
francis
yes
now
i
recollect
why
the
fact
is--
pedro
called
a
voice
from
above
the
man
stopped
put
his
fingers
to
his
lips
went
out
and
locked
the
door
god
of
heaven
give
me
patience
cried
philip
but
this
is
too
trying
he
will
be
down
here
again
to-morrow
morning
observed
krantz
yes
to-morrow
morning
but
what
an
endless
time
will
suspense
make
of
the
intervening
hours
i
feel
for
you
replied
krantz
but
what
can
be
done
the
hours
must
pass
though
suspense
draws
them
out
into
interminable
years
but
i
hear
footsteps
again
the
door
was
unlocked
and
the
first
soldier
made
his
appearance
follow
me--the
commandant
would
speak
with
you
this
unexpected
summons
was
cheerfully
complied
with
by
philip
and
his
companion
they
walked
up
the
narrow
stone
steps
and
at
last
found
themselves
in
a
small
room
in
presence
of
the
commandant
with
whom
our
readers
have
been
already
made
acquainted
he
was
lolling
on
a
small
sofa
his
long
sword
lay
on
the
table
before
him
and
two
young
native
women
were
fanning
him
one
at
his
head
and
the
other
at
his
feet
where
did
you
get
those
dresses
was
the
first
interrogatory
the
natives
when
they
brought
us
prisoners
from
the
island
on
which
we
had
saved
ourselves
took
away
our
clothes
and
gave
us
these
as
a
present
from
their
king
and
engaged
you
to
serve
in
their
fleet
in
the
attack
of
this
fort
they
forced
us
replied
krantz
for
as
there
was
no
war
between
our
nations
we
objected
to
this
service
notwithstanding
which
they
put
us
on
board
to
make
the
common
people
believe
that
they
were
assisted
by
europeans
how
am
i
to
know
the
truth
of
this
you
have
our
word
in
the
first
place
and
our
escape
from
them
in
the
second
you
belonged
to
a
dutch
east-indiaman
are
you
officers
or
common
seamen
krantz
who
considered
that
they
were
less
likely
to
be
detained
if
they
concealed
their
rank
on
board
gave
philip
a
slight
touch
with
his
finger
as
he
replied
we
are
inferior
officers
i
was
third
mate
and
this
man
was
pilot
and
your
captain
where
is
he
i--i
cannot
say
whether
he
is
alive
or
dead
had
you
no
woman
on
board
yes
the
captain
had
his
wife
what
has
become
of
her
she
is
supposed
to
have
perished
on
a
portion
of
the
raft
which
broke
a
drift
ha
replied
the
commandant
who
remained
silent
for
some
time
philip
looked
at
krantz
as
much
as
to
say
why
all
this
subterfuge
but
krantz
gave
him
a
sign
to
leave
him
to
speak
you
say
you
don't
know
whether
your
captain
is
alive
or
dead
i
do
now
suppose
i
was
to
give
you
your
liberty
would
you
have
any
objection
to
sign
a
paper
stating
his
death
and
swearing
to
the
truth
of
it
philip
stared
at
the
commandant
and
then
at
krantz
i
see
no
objection
exactly
except
that
if
it
were
sent
home
to
holland
we
might
get
into
trouble
may
i
ask
signor
commandant
why
you
wish
for
such
a
paper
no
roared
the
little
man
in
a
voice
like
thunder
i
will
give
no
reason
but
that
i
wish
it
that
is
enough
take
your
choice--the
dungeon
or
liberty
and
a
passage
by
the
first
vessel
which
calls
i
don't
doubt--in
fact--i'm
sure
he
must
be
dead
by
this
time
replied
krantz
drawling
out
the
words
in
a
musing
manner
commandant
will
you
give
us
till
to-morrow
morning
to
make
our
calculations
yes
you
may
go
but
not
to
the
dungeon
commandant
replied
krantz
we
are
not
prisoners
certainly
and
if
you
wish
us
to
do
you
a
favour
surely
you
will
not
ill-treat
us
by
your
own
acknowledgment
you
have
taken
up
arms
against
the
most
christian
king
however
you
may
remain
at
liberty
for
the
night--
to-morrow
morning
will
decide
whether
or
no
you
are
prisoners
philip
and
krantz
thanked
the
little
commandant
for
his
kindness
and
then
hastened
away
to
the
ramparts
it
was
now
dark
and
the
moon
had
not
yet
made
her
appearance
they
sat
there
on
the
parapet
enjoying
the
breeze
and
feeling
the
delight
of
liberty
even
after
their
short
incarceration
but
near
to
them
soldiers
were
either
standing
or
lying
and
they
spoke
but
in
whispers
what
could
he
mean
by
requiring
us
to
give
a
certificate
of
the
captain's
death
and
why
did
you
answer
as
you
did
philip
vanderdecken
that
i
have
often
thought
of
the
fate
of
your
beautiful
wife
you
may
imagine
and
when
i
heard
that
she
was
brought
here
i
then
trembled
for
her
what
must
she
appear
lovely
as
she
is
when
placed
in
comparison
with
the
women
of
this
country
and
that
little
commandant--is
he
not
the
very
person
who
would
be
taken
with
her
charms
i
denied
our
condition
because
i
thought
he
would
be
more
likely
to
allow
us
our
liberty
as
humble
individuals
than
as
captain
and
first-mate
particularly
as
he
suspects
that
we
led
on
the
ternate
people
to
the
attack
and
when
he
asked
for
a
certificate
of
your
death
i
immediately
imagined
that
he
wanted
it
in
order
to
induce
amine
to
marry
him
but
where
is
she
is
the
question
if
we
could
only
find
out
that
soldier
we
might
gain
some
information
depend
upon
it
she
is
here
replied
philip
clenching
his
hands
i
am
inclined
to
think
so
said
krantz
that
she
is
alive
i
feel
assured
the
conversation
was
continued
until
the
moon
rose
and
threw
her
beams
over
the
tumbling
waters
philip
and
krantz
turned
their
faces
toward
the
sea
and
leant
over
the
battlements
in
silence
after
some
time
their
reveries
were
disturbed
by
a
person
coming
up
to
them
with
a
buenos
noctes
signor
krantz
immediately
recognised
the
portuguese
soldier
whose
conversation
with
him
had
been
interrupted
good
night
my
friend
we
thank
heaven
that
you
have
no
longer
to
turn
the
key
upon
us
yes
i'm
surprised
replied
the
soldier
in
a
low
tone--our
commandant
is
fond
of
exercising
his
power
he
rules
here
without
appeal
that
i
can
tell
you
he
is
not
within
hearing
of
us
now
replied
krantz
it
is
a
lovely
spot
this
to
live
in
how
long
have
you
been
in
this
country
now
thirteen
years
signor
and
i'm
tired
of
it
i
have
a
wife
and
children
in
oporto--that
is
i
had--but
whether
they
are
alive
or
not
who
can
tell
do
you
not
expect
to
return
and
see
them
return--signor
no
portuguese
soldier
like
me
ever
returns
we
are
enlisted
for
five
years
and
we
lay
our
bones
here
that
is
hard
indeed
hard
signor
replied
the
soldier
in
a
low
whisper
it
is
cruel
and
treacherous
i
have
often
thought
of
putting
the
muzzle
of
my
arquebuse
to
my
head
but
while
there's
life
there's
hope
i
pity
you
my
good
fellow
rejoined
krantz
look
you
i
have
two
gold
pieces
left--take
one
you
may
be
able
to
send
it
home
to
your
poor
wife
and
here
is
one
of
mine
too
my
good
fellow
added
philip
putting
another
in
his
hand
now
may
all
the
saints
preserve
you
signors
replied
the
soldier
for
it
is
the
first
act
of
kindness
shown
to
me
for
many
years--not
that
my
wife
and
children
have
much
chance
of
ever
receiving
it
you
were
speaking
about
a
young
european
woman
when
we
were
in
the
dungeon
observed
krantz
after
a
pause
yes
signor
she
was
a
very
beautiful
creature
our
commandant
was
very
much
in
love
with
her
where
is
she
now
she
went
away
to
goa
in
company
with
a
priest
who
knew
her
father
mathias
a
good
old
man
he
gave
me
absolution
when
he
was
here
father
mathias
exclaimed
philip
but
a
touch
from
krantz
checked
him
you
say
the
commandant
loved
her
oh
yes
the
little
man
was
quite
mad
about
her
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
arrival
of
father
mathias
he
would
never
have
let
her
go
that
i'm
sure
of
although
she
was
another
man's
wife
sailed
for
goa
you
said
yes
in
a
ship
which
called
here
she
must
have
been
very
glad
to
have
got
away
for
our
little
commandant
persecuted
her
all
day
long
and
she
evidently
was
grieving
for
her
husband
do
you
know
signors
if
her
husband
is
alive
no
we
do
not
we
have
heard
nothing
of
him
well
if
he
is
i
hope
he
will
not
come
here
for
should
the
commandant
have
him
in
his
power
it
would
go
hard
with
him
he
is
a
man
who
sticks
at
nothing
he
is
a
brave
little
fellow
that
cannot
be
denied
but
to
get
possession
of
that
lady
he
would
remove
all
obstacles
at
any
risk--and
a
husband
is
a
very
serious
one
signors
well
signors
continued
the
soldier
after
a
pause
i
had
better
not
be
seen
here
too
long--you
may
command
me
if
you
want
anything
recollect
my
name
is
pedro--good
night
to
you
and
a
thousand
thanks
and
the
soldier
walked
away
we
have
made
one
friend
at
all
events
said
krantz
and
we
have
gained
information
of
no
little
importance
most
important
replied
philip
amine
then
has
sailed
for
goa
with
father
mathias
i
feel
that
she
is
safe
and
in
good
hands
he
is
an
excellent
man
that
father
mathias--my
mind
is
relieved
yes
but
recollect
you
are
in
the
power
of
your
enemy
we
must
leave
this
place
as
quick
as
we
can--to-morrow
we
must
sign
the
paper
it
is
of
little
consequence
as
we
shall
probably
be
at
goa
before
it
arrives
and
even
if
we
are
not
the
news
of
your
death
would
not
occasion
amine
to
marry
this
withered
piece
of
mortality
that
i
feel
assured
of
but
it
may
cause
her
great
suffering
not
worse
than
her
present
suspense
believe
me
philip
but
it
is
useless
canvassing
the
past--it
must
be
done
i
shall
sign
as
cornelius
richter
our
third
mate
you
as
jacob
vantreat--recollect
that
agreed
replied
philip
who
then
turned
away
as
if
willing
to
be
left
to
his
own
thoughts
krantz
perceived
it
and
lay
down
under
the
embrasure
and
was
soon
fast
asleep
tired
out
with
the
fatigue
of
the
day
before
philip
had
laid
himself
down
by
krantz
and
fallen
asleep
early
the
next
morning
he
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
the
commandant's
voice
and
his
long
sword
rattling
as
usual
upon
the
pavement
he
rose
and
found
the
little
man
rating
the
soldiers--threatening
some
with
the
dungeons
others
with
extra
duty
krantz
was
also
on
his
feet
before
the
commandant
had
finished
his
morning's
lecture
at
last
perceiving
them
in
a
stern
voice
he
ordered
them
to
follow
him
into
his
apartment
they
did
so
and
the
commandant
throwing
himself
upon
his
sofa
inquired
whether
they
were
ready
to
sign
the
required
paper
or
go
back
to
the
dungeon
krantz
replied
that
they
had
been
calculating
chances
and
that
they
were
in
consequence
so
perfectly
convinced
of
the
death
of
the
captain
that
they
were
willing
to
sign
any
paper
to
that
effect
at
which
reply
the
commandant
immediately
became
very
gracious
and
having
called
for
materials
he
wrote
out
the
document
which
was
duly
subscribed
to
by
krantz
and
philip
as
soon
as
they
had
signed
it
and
he
had
it
in
his
possession
the
little
man
was
so
pleased
that
he
requested
them
to
partake
of
his
breakfast
during
the
repast
he
promised
that
they
should
leave
the
island
by
the
first
opportunity
although
philip
was
taciturn
yet
as
krantz
made
himself
very
agreeable
the
commandant
invited
them
to
dinner
krantz
as
they
became
more
familiar
informed
him
that
they
had
each
a
few
pieces
of
gold
and
wished
to
be
allowed
a
room
where
they
could
keep
their
table
whether
it
was
the
want
of
society
or
the
desire
of
obtaining
the
gold
probably
both
the
commandant
offered
that
they
should
join
his
table
and
pay
their
proportion
of
the
expenses
a
proposal
which
was
gladly
acceded
to
the
terms
were
arranged
and
krantz
insisted
upon
putting
down
the
first
week's
payment
in
advance
from
that
moment
the
commandant
was
the
best
of
friends
with
them
and
did
nothing
but
caress
them
whom
he
had
so
politely
shoved
into
a
dungeon
below
water
it
was
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
as
they
were
smoking
their
manilla
cheroots
that
krantz
perceiving
the
commandant
in
a
peculiarly
good
humour
ventured
to
ask
him
why
he
was
so
anxious
for
a
certificate
of
the
captain's
death
and
in
reply
was
informed
much
to
the
astonishment
of
philip
that
amine
had
agreed
to
marry
him
upon
his
producing
such
a
document
impossible
cried
philip
starting
from
his
seat
impossible
signor--and
why
impossible
replied
the
commandant
curling
his
mustachios
with
his
fingers
with
a
surprised
and
angry
air
i
should
have
said
impossible
too
interrupted
krantz
who
perceived
the
consequences
of
philip's
indiscretion
for
had
you
seen
commandant
how
that
woman
doated
upon
her
husband
how
she
fondled
him
you
would
with
us
have
said
it
was
impossible
that
she
could
have
transferred
her
affections
so
soon
but
women
are
women
and
soldiers
have
a
great
advantage
over
other
people
perhaps
she
has
some
excuse
commandant--here's
your
health
and
success
to
you
it
is
exactly
what
i
would
have
said
added
philip
acting
upon
krantz's
plan
but
she
has
a
great
excuse
commandant
when
i
recollect
her
husband
and
have
you
in
my
presence
soothed
with
the
flattery
the
commandant
replied
why
yes
they
say
military
men
are
very
successful
with
the
fair
sex--i
presume
it
is
because
they
look
up
to
us
for
protections
and
where
can
they
be
better
assured
of
it
than
with
a
man
who
wears
a
sword
at
his
thigh--come
signors
we
will
drink
her
health
here's
to
the
beautiful
amine
vanderdecken
to
the
beautiful
amine
vanderdecken
cried
krantz
tossing
off
his
wine
to
the
beautiful
amine
vanderdecken
followed
philip
but
commandant
are
you
not
afraid
to
trust
her
at
goa
where
there
are
so
many
enticements
for
a
woman
so
many
allurements
held
out
for
her
sex
no
not
in
the
least--i
am
convinced
that
she
loves
me--nay
between
ourselves
that
she
doats
upon
me
liar
exclaimed
philip
how
signor
is
that
addressed
to
me
cried
the
commandant
seizing
his
sword
which
lay
on
the
table
no
no
replied
philip
recovering
himself
it
was
addressed
to
her
i
have
heard
her
swear
to
her
husband
that
she
would
exist
for
no
other
but
him
ha
ha
is
that
all
replied
the
commandant
my
friend
you
do
not
know
women
no
nor
is
he
very
partial
to
them
either
replied
krantz
who
then
leant
over
to
the
commandant
and
whispered
he
is
always
so
when
you
talk
of
women
he
was
cruelly
jilted
once
and
hates
the
whole
sex
then
we
must
be
merciful
to
him
replied
the
little
officer
suppose
we
change
the
subject
when
they
repaired
to
their
own
room
krantz
pointed
out
to
philip
the
necessity
for
his
commanding
his
feelings
as
otherwise
they
would
again
be
immured
in
the
dungeon
philip
acknowledged
his
rashness
but
pointed
out
to
krantz
that
the
circumstance
of
amine
having
promised
to
marry
the
commandant
if
he
procured
certain
intelligence
of
his
death
was
the
cause
of
his
irritation
can
it
be
so
is
it
possible
that
she
can
have
been
so
false
exclaimed
philip
yet
his
anxiety
to
procure
that
document
seems
to
warrant
the
truth
of
his
assertion
i
think
philip
that
in
all
probability
it
is
true
replied
krantz
carelessly
but
of
this
you
may
be
assured
that
she
has
been
placed
in
a
situation
of
great
peril
and
has
only
done
so
to
save
herself
for
your
sake
when
you
meet
depend
upon
it
she
will
fully
prove
to
you
that
necessity
had
compelled
her
to
deceive
him
in
that
way
and
that
if
she
had
not
done
so
she
would
by
this
time
have
fallen
a
prey
to
his
violence
it
may
be
so
replied
philip
gravely
it
is
so
philip
my
life
upon
it
do
not
for
a
moment
harbour
a
thought
so
injurious
to
one
who
lives
but
in
your
love
suspect
that
fond
and
devoted
creature
i
blush
for
you
philip
vanderdecken
you
are
right
and
i
beg
her
pardon
for
allowing
such
feelings
or
thoughts
to
have
for
one
moment
overpowered
me
responded
philip
but
it
is
a
hard
case
for
a
husband
who
loves
as
i
do
to
hear
his
wife's
name
bandied
about
and
her
character
assailed
by
a
contemptible
wretch
like
this
commandant
it
is
i
grant
but
still
i
prefer
even
that
to
a
dungeon
replied
krantz
and
so
good
night
for
three
weeks
they
remained
in
the
fort
every
day
becoming
more
intimate
with
the
commandant
who
often
communicated
with
krantz
when
philip
was
not
present
turning
the
conversation
upon
his
love
for
amine
and
entering
into
a
minute
detail
of
all
that
had
passed
krantz
perceived
that
he
was
right
in
his
opinion
and
that
amine
had
only
been
cajoling
the
commandant
that
she
might
escape
but
the
time
passed
heavily
away
with
philip
and
krantz
for
no
vessel
made
its
appearance
when
shall
i
see
her
again
soliloquised
philip
one
morning
as
he
lolled
over
the
parapet
in
company
with
krantz
see
who
said
the
commandant
who
happened
to
be
at
his
elbow
philip
turned
round
and
stammered
something
unintelligible
we
were
talking
of
his
sister
commandant
said
krantz
taking
his
arm
and
leading
him
away--do
not
mention
the
subject
to
my
friend
for
it
is
a
very
painful
one
and
forms
one
reason
why
he
is
so
inimical
to
the
sex
she
was
married
to
his
intimate
friend
and
ran
away
from
her
husband
it
was
his
only
sister
and
the
disgrace
broke
his
mother's
heart
and
has
made
him
miserable
take
no
notice
of
it
i
beg
no
no
certainly
not
i
don't
wonder
at
it
the
honour
of
one's
family
is
a
serious
affair
replied
the
commandant--poor
young
man
what
with
his
sister's
conduct
and
the
falsehood
of
his
own
intended
i
don't
wonder
at
his
being
so
grave
and
silent
is
he
of
good
family
signor
one
of
the
noblest
in
all
holland
replied
krantz--he
is
heir
to
a
large
property
and
independent
by
the
fortune
of
his
mother
but
these
two
unfortunate
events
induced
him
to
quit
the
states
secretly
and
he
embarked
for
these
countries
that
he
might
forget
his
grief
one
of
the
noblest
families
replied
the
commandant--then
he
is
under
an
assumed
name--jacob
vancheat
is
not
his
true
name
of
course
oh
no
replied
krantz--that
it
is
not
i
assure
you
but
my
lips
are
sealed
on
that
point
of
course
except
to
a
friend
who
can
keep
a
secret
i
will
not
ask
it
now
so
he
is
really
noble
one
of
the
highest
families
in
the
country
possessing
great
wealth
and
influence--allied
to
the
spanish
nobility
by
marriage
indeed
rejoined
the
commandant
musing--i
dare
say
he
knows
many
of
the
portuguese
as
well
no
doubt
of
it
they
are
all
more
or
less
connected
he
must
prove
to
you
a
most
valuable
friend
signor
richter
i
consider
myself
provided
for
for
life
as
soon
as
we
return
home
he
is
of
a
very
grateful
generous
disposition
as
he
would
prove
to
you
should
you
ever
fall
in
with
him
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
and
i
can
assure
you
that
i
am
heartily
tired
of
staying
in
this
country
here
i
shall
remain
probably
for
two
years
more
before
i
am
relieved
and
then
shall
have
to
join
my
regiment
at
goa
and
not
be
able
to
obtain
leave
to
return
home
without
resigning
my
commission
but
he
is
coming
this
way
after
this
conversation
with
krantz
the
alteration
in
the
manner
of
the
portuguese
commandant
who
had
the
highest
respect
for
nobility
was
most
marked
he
treated
philip
with
a
respect
which
was
observable
to
all
in
the
fort
and
which
was
until
krantz
had
explained
the
cause
a
source
of
astonishment
to
philip
himself
the
commandant
often
introduced
the
subject
to
krantz
and
sounded
him
as
to
whether
his
conduct
towards
philip
had
been
such
as
to
have
made
a
favourable
impression
for
the
little
man
now
hoped
that
through
such
an
influential
channel
he
might
reap
some
benefit
some
days
after
this
conversation
as
they
were
all
three
seated
at
table
a
corporal
entered
and
saluting
the
commandant
informed
him
that
a
dutch
sailor
had
arrived
at
fort
and
wished
to
know
whether
he
should
be
admitted
both
philip
and
krantz
turned
pale
at
this
communication--they
had
a
presentiment
of
evil
but
they
said
nothing
the
sailor
was
ordered
in
and
in
a
few
minutes
who
should
make
his
appearance
but
their
tormentor
the
one-eyed
schriften
on
perceiving
philip
and
krantz
seated
at
the
table
he
immediately
exclaimed
oh
captain
philip
vanderdecken
and
my
good
friend
mynheer
krantz
first
mate
of
the
good
ship
utrecht
i
am
glad
to
meet
you
again
captain
philip
vanderdecken
roared
the
commandant
as
he
sprung
from
his
chair
yes
that
is
my
captain
mynheer
philip
vanderdecken
and
that
is
my
first
mate
mynheer
krantz
both
of
the
good
ship
utrecht
we
were
wrecked
together
were
we
not
mynheer
he
he
sangue
de--vanderdecken
the
husband
corpo
del
diavolo--is
it
possible
cried
the
commandant
panting
for
breath
as
he
seized
his
long
sword
with
both
hands
and
clenched
it
with
fury--what
then
i
have
been
deceived
cajoled
laughed
at
then
after
a
pause--the
veins
of
his
forehead
distending
so
as
almost
to
burst--he
continued
with
a
suppressed
voice
most
noble
sir
i
thank
you
but
now
it
is
my
turn--what
ho
there
corporal--men
here
instantly--quick
philip
and
krantz
felt
convinced
that
all
denial
was
useless
philip
folded
his
arms
and
made
no
reply
krantz
merely
observed
a
little
reflection
will
prove
to
you
sir
that
this
indignation
is
not
warranted
not
warranted
rejoined
the
commandant
with
a
sneer
you
have
deceived
me
but
you
are
caught
in
your
own
trap
i
have
the
paper
signed
which
i
shall
not
fail
to
make
use
of
you
are
dead
you
know
captain
i
have
your
own
hand
to
it
and
your
wife
will
be
glad
to
believe
it
she
has
deceived
you
commandant
to
get
out
of
your
power
nothing
more
said
vanderdecken
she
would
spurn
a
contemptible
withered
wretch
like
yourself
were
she
as
free
as
the
wind
go
on
go
on
it
will
be
my
turn
soon
corporal
throw
these
two
men
into
the
dungeon
a
sentry
at
the
door
till
further
orders
away
with
them
most
noble
sir
perhaps
your
influential
friends
in
holland
and
spain
will
enable
you
to
get
out
again
philip
and
krantz
were
led
away
by
the
soldiers
who
were
very
much
surprised
at
this
change
of
treatment
schriften
followed
them
and
as
they
walked
across
the
rampart
to
the
stairs
which
led
to
their
prison
krantz
in
his
fury
burst
from
the
soldiers
and
bestowed
a
kick
upon
schriften
which
sent
him
several
feet
forward
on
his
face
that
was
a
good
one--he
he
cried
schriften
smiling
and
looking
at
krantz
as
he
regained
his
legs
there
was
an
eye
however
which
met
theirs
with
an
intelligent
glance
as
they
descended
the
stairs
to
the
dungeon
it
was
that
of
the
soldier
pedro
it
told
them
that
there
was
one
friend
upon
whom
they
could
rely
and
who
would
spare
no
endeavour
to
assist
them
in
their
new
difficulty
it
was
a
consolation
to
them
both
a
ray
of
hope
which
cheered
them
as
they
once
more
descended
the
narrow
steps
and
heard
the
heavy
key
turned
which
again
secured
them
in
their
dungeon
thus
are
all
our
hopes
wrecked
said
philip
mournfully
what
chance
have
we
now
of
escaping
from
this
little
tyrant
chances
turn
up
replied
krantz
at
present
the
prospect
is
not
very
cheering
let
us
hope
for
the
best
i
have
an
idea
in
my
head
which
may
probably
be
turned
to
some
account
continued
krantz
as
soon
as
the
little
man's
fury
is
over
which
is
that
much
as
he
likes
your
wife
there
is
something
which
he
likes
quite
as
well--money
now
as
we
know
where
all
the
treasure
is
concealed
i
think
he
may
be
tempted
to
offer
us
our
liberty
if
we
were
to
promise
to
put
it
into
his
possession
that
is
not
impossible
confound
that
little
malignant
wretch
schriften
he
certainly
is
not
as
you
say
of
this
world
he
has
been
my
persecutor
through
life
and
appears
to
act
from
an
impulse
not
his
own
then
must
he
be
part
and
portion
of
your
destiny
i'm
thinking
whether
our
noble
commandant
intends
to
leave
us
without
anything
to
eat
or
drink
i
should
not
be
surprised
that
he
will
attempt
my
life
i
am
convinced
but
not
that
he
can
take
it
he
may
however
add
to
its
sufferings
as
soon
as
the
commandant
had
recovered
from
his
fury
he
ordered
schriften
in
to
be
examined
more
particularly
but
after
every
search
made
for
him
schriften
was
nowhere
to
be
found
the
sentry
at
the
gate
declared
that
he
had
not
passed
and
a
new
search
was
ordered
but
in
vain
even
the
dungeons
and
galleries
below
were
examined
but
without
success
can
he
be
locked
up
with
the
other
prisoners
thought
the
commandant
impossible--but
i
will
go
and
see
he
descended
and
opened
the
door
of
the
dungeon
looked
in
and
was
about
to
return
without
speaking
when
krantz
said
well
signor
this
is
kind
treatment
after
having
lived
so
long
and
so
amicably
together
to
throw
us
into
prison
merely
because
a
fellow
declares
that
we
are
not
what
we
represented
ourselves
to
be
perhaps
you
will
allow
us
a
little
water
to
drink
the
commandant
confused
by
the
extraordinary
disappearance
of
schriften
hardly
knew
how
to
reply
he
at
last
said
in
a
milder
tone
than
was
to
be
anticipated
i
will
order
them
to
bring
some
signor
he
then
closed
the
door
of
the
dungeon
and
disappeared
strange
observed
philip
he
appears
more
pacified
already
in
a
few
minutes
the
door
was
again
opened
and
pedro
came
in
with
a
chatty
of
water
he
has
disappeared
like
magic
signors
and
is
nowhere
to
be
found
we
have
searched
everywhere
but
in
vain
who--the
little
old
seaman
yes
he
whom
you
kicked
as
you
were
led
to
prison
the
people
all
say
that
it
must
have
been
a
ghost
the
sentry
declares
that
he
never
left
the
fort
nor
came
near
him
so
how
he
has
got
away
is
a
riddle
which
i
perceive
has
frightened
our
commandant
not
a
little
krantz
gave
a
long
whistle
as
he
looked
at
philip
are
you
to
have
charge
of
us
pedro
i
hope
so
well
tell
the
commandant
that
when
he
is
ready
to
listen
to
me
i
have
something
of
importance
to
communicate
pedro
went
out
now
philip
i
can
frighten
this
little
man
into
allowing
us
to
go
free
if
you
will
consent
to
say
that
you
are
not
the
husband
of
amine
that
i
cannot
do
krantz
i
will
not
utter
such
a
falsehood
i
was
afraid
so
and
yet
it
appears
to
me
that
we
may
avail
ourselves
of
duplicity
to
meet
cruelty
and
injustice
unless
you
do
as
i
propose
i
hardly
know
how
i
can
manage
it
however
i
will
try
what
i
can
do
i
will
assist
you
in
every
way
except
disclaiming
my
wife
that
i
never
will
do
well
then
i
will
see
if
i
can
make
up
a
story
that
will
suit
all
parties
let
me
think
krantz
continued
musing
as
he
walked
up
and
down
and
was
still
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
when
the
door
opened
and
the
commandant
made
his
appearance
you
have
something
to
impart
to
me
i
understand--what
is
it
first
sir
bring
that
little
wretch
down
here
and
confront
him
with
us
i
see
no
occasion
for
that
replied
the
commandant
what
sir
may
you
have
to
say
do
you
know
who
you
have
in
your
company
when
you
speak
to
that
one-eyed
deformity
a
dutch
sailor
i
presume
no--a
spirit--a
demon--who
occasioned
the
loss
of
the
vessel
and
who
brings
misfortune
wherever
he
appears
holy
virgin
what
do
you
tell
me
signor
the
fact
signor
commandant
we
are
obliged
to
you
for
confining
us
here
while
he
is
in
the
fort
but
beware
for
yourself
you
are
laughing
at
me
i
am
not
bring
him
down
here
this
noble
gentleman
has
power
over
him
i
wonder
indeed
at
his
daring
to
stay
while
he
is
so
near
he
has
on
his
heart
that
which
will
send
him
trembling
away
bring
him
down
here
and
you
shall
at
once
see
him
vanish
with
curses
and
screams
heaven
defend
us
cried
the
commandant
terrified
send
for
him
now
signor
he
is
gone--vanished--not
to
be
found
i
thought
as
much
replied
philip
significantly
he
is
gone--vanished--you
say
then
commandant
you
will
probably
apologise
to
this
noble
gentleman
for
your
treatment
of
him
and
permit
us
to
return
to
our
former
apartments
i
will
there
explain
to
you
this
most
strange
and
interesting
history
the
commandant
more
confused
than
ever
hardly
knew
how
to
act
at
last
he
bowed
to
philip
and
begged
that
he
would
consider
himself
at
liberty
and
continued
he
to
krantz
i
shall
be
most
happy
at
an
immediate
explanation
of
this
affair
for
everything
appears
so
contradictory
and
must
until
it
is
explained
i
will
follow
you
into
your
own
room
a
courtesy
you
must
not
expect
from
my
noble
friend
who
is
not
a
little
indignant
at
your
treatment
of
him
the
commandant
went
out
leaving
the
door
open
philip
and
krantz
followed
the
former
retiring
to
his
own
apartment
the
latter
bending
his
steps
after
the
commandant
to
his
sitting-room
the
confusion
which
whirled
in
the
brain
of
the
commandant
made
him
appear
most
ridiculous
he
hardly
knew
whether
to
be
imperative
or
civil
whether
he
was
really
speaking
to
the
first
mate
of
the
vessel
or
to
another
party
or
whether
he
had
insulted
a
noble
or
been
cajoled
by
a
captain
of
a
vessel
he
threw
himself
down
on
his
sofa
and
krantz
taking
his
seat
in
a
chair
stated
as
follows--
you
have
been
partly
deceived
and
partly
not
commandant
when
we
first
came
here
not
knowing
what
treatment
we
might
receive
we
concealed
our
rank
afterwards
i
made
known
to
you
the
rank
of
my
friend
on
shore
but
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
say
anything
about
his
situation
on
board
of
the
vessel
the
fact
is
as
you
may
well
suppose
of
a
person
of
his
dignity
he
was
owner
of
the
fine
ship
which
was
lost
through
the
intervention
of
that
one-eyed
wretch
but
of
that
by-and-by
now
for
the
story
about
ten
years
ago
there
was
a
great
miser
in
amsterdam
he
lived
in
the
most
miserable
way
that
a
man
could
live
in
wore
nothing
but
rags
and
having
been
formerly
a
seaman
his
attire
was
generally
of
the
description
common
to
his
class
he
had
one
son
to
whom
he
denied
the
necessaries
of
life
and
whom
he
treated
most
cruelly
after
vain
attempts
to
possess
a
portion
of
his
father's
wealth
the
devil
instigated
the
son
to
murder
the
old
man
who
was
one
day
found
dead
in
his
bed
but
as
there
were
no
marks
of
violence
which
could
be
sworn
to
although
suspicion
fell
upon
the
son
the
affair
was
hushed
up
and
the
young
man
took
possession
of
his
father's
wealth
it
was
fully
expected
that
there
would
now
be
rioting
and
squandering
on
the
part
of
the
heir
as
is
usually
the
case
but
on
the
contrary
he
never
spent
anything
but
appeared
to
be
as
poor--even
poorer--than
he
ever
was
instead
of
being
gay
and
merry
he
was
in
appearance
the
most
miserable
downcast
person
in
the
world
and
he
wandered
about
seeking
a
crust
of
bread
wherever
he
could
find
it
some
said
that
he
had
been
inoculated
by
his
father
and
was
as
great
a
miser
as
his
father
had
been
others
shook
their
heads
and
said
that
all
was
not
right
at
last
after
pining
away
for
six
or
seven
years
the
young
man
died
at
an
early
age
without
confession
or
absolution
in
fact
he
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
beside
the
bed
there
was
a
paper
addressed
to
the
authorities
in
which
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
murdered
his
father
for
the
sake
of
his
wealth
and
that
when
he
went
to
take
some
of
it
for
his
expenses
on
the
day
afterwards
he
found
his
father's
spirit
sitting
on
the
bags
of
money
and
menacing
him
with
instant
death
if
he
touched
one
piece
he
returned
again
and
again
and
found
his
father
a
sentinel
as
before
at
last
he
gave
up
attempting
to
obtain
it
his
crime
made
him
miserable
and
he
continued
in
possession
without
daring
to
expend
one
sixpence
of
all
the
money
he
requested
that
as
his
end
was
approaching
the
money
should
be
given
to
the
church
of
his
patron
saint
wherever
that
church
might
be
found
if
there
was
not
one
then
that
a
church
might
be
built
and
endowed
upon
investigation
it
appeared
that
there
was
no
such
church
in
either
holland
or
the
low
countries
for
you
know
that
there
are
not
many
catholics
there
and
they
applied
to
the
catholic
countries
lisbon
and
spain
but
there
again
they
were
at
fault
and
it
was
discovered
that
the
only
church
dedicated
to
that
saint
was
one
which
had
been
erected
by
a
portuguese
nobleman
in
the
city
of
goa
in
the
east
indies
the
catholic
bishop
determined
that
the
money
should
be
sent
to
goa
and
in
consequence
it
was
embarked
on
board
of
my
patron's
vessel
to
be
delivered
up
to
the
first
portuguese
authorities
he
might
fall
in
with
well
signor
the
money
for
better
security
was
put
down
into
the
captain's
cabin
which
of
course
was
occupied
by
my
noble
friend
and
when
he
went
to
bed
the
first
night
he
was
surprised
to
perceive
a
little
one-eyed
old
man
sitting
on
the
boxes
merciful
saviour
exclaimed
the
commandant
what
the
very
same
little
man
who
appeared
here
this
day
the
very
same
replied
krantz
the
commandant
crossed
himself
and
krantz
proceeded--
my
noble
patron
was
as
you
may
imagine
rather
alarmed
but
he
is
very
courageous
in
disposition
and
he
inquired
of
the
old
man
who
he
was
and
how
he
had
come
on
board
i
came
on
board
with
my
own
money'
replied
the
spectre
it
is
all
my
own
and
i
shall
keep
it
the
church
shall
never
have
one
stiver
of
it
if
i
can
help
it'
whereupon
my
patron
pulled
out
a
famous
relic
which
he
wears
on
his
bosom
and
held
it
towards
him
at
which
the
old
man
howled
and
screamed
and
then
most
unwillingly
disappeared
for
two
more
nights
the
spectre
was
obstinate
but
at
the
sight
of
the
relic
he
invariably
went
off
howling
as
if
in
great
pain
every
time
that
he
went
away
invariably
crying
out
lost--lost'--and
during
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
he
did
not
trouble
us
any
more
we
thought
when
our
patron
told
us
this
that
he
referred
to
the
money
being
lost
to
him
but
it
appears
he
referred
to
the
ship
indeed
it
was
very
inconsiderate
to
have
taken
the
wealth
of
a
parricide
on
board
we
could
not
expect
any
good
fortune
with
such
a
freight
and
so
it
proved
when
the
ship
was
lost
our
patron
was
very
anxious
to
save
the
money
it
was
put
on
the
raft
and
when
we
landed
it
was
taken
on
shore
and
buried
that
it
might
be
restored
and
given
to
the
church
to
which
it
had
been
bequeathed
but
the
men
who
buried
it
are
all
dead
and
there
is
no
one
but
my
friend
here
the
patron
who
knows
the
spot--i
forgot
to
say
that
as
soon
as
the
money
was
landed
on
the
island
and
buried
the
spectre
appeared
as
before
and
seated
itself
over
the
spot
where
the
money
was
interred
i
think
if
this
had
not
been
the
case
the
seamen
would
have
taken
possession
of
it
but
by
its
appearance
here
this
day
i
presume
it
is
tired
and
has
deserted
its
charge
or
else
has
come
here
that
the
money
might
be
sent
for
though
i
cannot
understand
why
strange--very
strange
so
there
is
a
large
treasure
buried
in
the
sand
there
is
i
should
think
by
the
spectre's
coming
here
that
it
has
abandoned
it
of
course
it
has
or
it
would
not
be
here
what
can
you
imagine
to
have
been
the
cause
of
its
coming
probably
to
announce
its
intention
and
request
my
friend
to
have
the
treasure
sent
for
but
you
know
it
was
interrupted
very
true
but
it
called
your
friend
vanderdecken
it
was
the
name
which
he
took
on
board
of
the
ship
and
it
was
the
name
of
the
lady
very
true
he
fell
in
with
her
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
brought
her
away
with
him
then
she
is
his
wife
i
must
not
answer
that
question
it
is
quite
sufficient
that
he
treats
her
as
his
wife
ah
indeed
but
about
this
treasure
you
say
that
no
one
knows
where
it
is
buried
but
the
patron
as
you
call
him
no
one
will
you
express
my
regret
at
what
has
passed
and
tell
him
i
will
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
to-morrow
certainly
signor
replied
krantz
rising
from
his
chair
and
wishing
the
commandant
a
good
evening
as
he
retired
i
was
after
one
thing
and
have
found
another
a
spectre
that
must
have
been
but
he
must
be
a
bold
spectre
that
can
frighten
me
from
doubloons
besides
i
can
call
in
the
priests
now
let
me
see
if
i
let
this
man
go
on
condition
that
he
reveals
the
site
of
the
treasure
to
the
authorities--that
is
to
me--why
then
i
need
not
lose
the
fair
young
woman
if
i
forward
this
paper
to
her
why
then
i
gain
her
but
i
must
first
get
rid
of
him
of
the
two
i
prefer--yes--the
gold
but
i
cannot
obtain
both
at
all
events
let
me
obtain
the
money
first
i
want
it
more
than
the
church
does
but
if
i
do
get
the
money
these
two
men
can
expose
me
i
must
get
rid
of
them--silence
them
for
ever--and
then
perhaps
i
may
obtain
the
fair
amine
also
yes
their
death
will
be
necessary
to
secure
either
that
is
after
i
have
the
first
in
my
possession
let
me
think
for
some
minutes
the
commandant
walked
up
and
down
the
room
reflecting
upon
the
best
method
of
proceeding
he
says
it
was
a
spectre
and
he
has
told
a
plausible
story
thought
he
but
i
don't
know--i
have
my
doubts
they
may
be
tricking
me
well
be
it
so
if
the
money
is
there
i
will
have
it
and
if
not
i
will
have
my
revenge
yes
i
have
it
not
only
must
they
be
removed
but
by
degrees
all
the
others
too
who
assist
in
bringing
the
treasure
away
then--but--who's
there
pedro
yes
signor
how
long
have
you
been
here
but
as
you
spoke
signor
i
thought
i
heard
you
call
you
may
go--i
want
nothing
pedro
departed
but
he
had
been
some
time
in
the
room
and
had
overheard
the
whole
of
the
commandant's
soliloquy
it
was
a
bright
morning
when
the
portuguese
vessel
on
which
amine
was
on
board
entered
into
the
bay
and
roadstead
of
goa
goa
was
then
at
its
zenith--a
proud
luxurious
superb
wealthy
city--the
capital
of
the
east--a
city
of
palaces
whose
viceroy
reigned
supreme
as
they
approached
the
river
the
two
mouths
of
which
form
the
island
upon
which
goa
is
built
the
passengers
were
all
on
deck
and
the
portuguese
captain
who
had
often
been
there
pointed
out
to
amine
the
most
remarkable
buildings
when
they
had
passed
the
forts
they
entered
the
river
the
whole
line
of
whose
banks
were
covered
with
the
country
seats
of
the
nobility
and
hidalgos--splendid
buildings
embosomed
in
groves
of
orange-trees
whose
perfume
scented
the
air
there
signora
is
the
country
palace
of
the
viceroy
said
the
captain
pointing
to
a
building
which
covered
nearly
three
acres
of
ground
the
ship
sailed
on
until
they
arrived
nearly
abreast
of
the
town
when
amine's
eyes
were
directed
to
the
lofty
spires
of
the
churches
and
other
public
edifices
for
amine
had
seen
but
little
of
cities
during
her
life
as
may
be
perceived
when
her
history
is
recollected
that
is
the
jesuits'
church
with
their
establishment
said
the
captain
pointing
to
a
magnificent
pile
in
the
church
now
opening
upon
us
lie
the
canonised
bones
of
the
celebrated
saint
francisco
who
sacrificed
his
life
in
his
zeal
for
the
propagation
of
the
gospel
in
these
countries
i
have
heard
of
him
from
father
mathias
replied
amine
but
what
building
is
that
the
augustine
convent
and
the
other
to
the
right
is
the
dominican
splendid
indeed
observed
amine
the
building
you
see
now
on
the
water-side
is
the
viceroy's
palace
that
to
the
right
again
is
the
convent
of
the
barefooted
carmelites
yon
lofty
spire
is
the
cathedral
of
st
catherine
and
that
beautiful
and
light
piece
of
architecture
is
the
church
of
our
lady
of
pity
you
observe
there
a
building
with
a
dome
rising
behind
the
viceroy's
palace
i
do
replied
amine
that
is
the
holy
inquisition
although
amine
had
heard
philip
speak
of
the
inquisition
she
knew
little
about
its
properties
but
a
sudden
tremor
passed
through
her
frame
as
the
name
was
mentioned
which
she
could
not
herself
account
for
now
we
open
upon
the
viceroy's
palace
and
you
perceive
what
a
beautiful
building
it
is
continued
the
captain
that
large
pile
a
little
above
it
is
the
custom-house
abreast
of
which
we
shall
come
to
an
anchor
i
must
leave
you
now
signora
a
few
minutes
afterwards
the
ship
anchored
opposite
the
custom-house
the
captain
and
passengers
went
on
shore
with
the
exception
of
amine
who
remained
in
the
vessel
while
father
mathias
went
in
search
of
an
eligible
place
of
abode
the
next
morning
the
priest
returned
on
board
the
ship
with
the
intelligence
that
he
had
obtained
a
reception
for
amine
in
the
ursuline
convent
the
abbess
of
which
establishment
he
was
acquainted
with
and
before
amine
went
on
shore
he
cautioned
her
that
the
lady-abbess
was
a
strict
woman
and
would
be
pleased
if
she
conformed
as
much
as
possible
to
the
rules
of
the
convent
that
this
convent
only
received
young
persons
of
the
highest
and
most
wealthy
families
and
he
trusted
that
she
would
be
happy
there
he
also
promised
to
call
upon
her
and
talk
upon
those
subjects
so
dear
to
his
heart
and
so
necessary
to
her
salvation
the
earnestness
and
kindness
with
which
the
old
man
spoke
melted
amine
to
tears
and
the
holy
father
quitted
her
side
to
go
down
and
collect
her
baggage
with
a
warmth
of
feeling
towards
her
which
he
had
seldom
felt
before
and
with
greater
hopes
than
ever
that
his
endeavours
to
convert
her
would
not
ultimately
be
thrown
away
he
is
a
good
man
thought
amine
as
she
descended--and
amine
was
right
father
mathias
was
a
good
man
but
like
all
men
he
was
not
perfect
a
zealot
in
the
cause
of
his
religion
he
would
have
cheerfully
sacrificed
his
life
as
a
martyr
but
if
opposed
or
thwarted
in
his
views
he
could
then
be
cruel
and
unjust
father
mathias
had
many
reasons
for
placing
amine
in
the
ursuline
convent
he
felt
bound
to
offer
her
that
protection
which
he
had
so
long
received
under
her
roof
he
wished
her
to
be
under
the
surveillance
of
the
abbess
for
he
could
not
help
imagining
although
he
had
no
proof
that
she
was
still
essaying
or
practising
forbidden
arts
he
did
not
state
this
to
the
abbess
as
he
felt
it
would
be
unjust
to
raise
suspicions
but
he
represented
amine
as
one
who
would
do
honour
to
their
faith
to
which
she
was
not
yet
quite
converted
the
very
idea
of
effecting
a
conversion
is
to
the
tenants
of
a
convent
an
object
of
surpassing
interest
and
the
abbess
was
much
better
pleased
to
receive
one
who
required
her
counsels
and
persuasions
than
a
really
pious
christian
who
would
give
her
no
trouble
amine
went
on
shore
with
father
mathias
she
refused
the
palanquin
which
had
been
prepared
for
her
and
walked
up
to
the
convent
they
landed
between
the
custom-house
and
the
viceroy's
palace
passed
through
the
large
square
behind
it
and
then
went
up
the
strada
diretta
or
straight
street
which
led
up
to
the
church
of
pity
near
to
which
the
convent
is
situated
this
street
is
the
finest
in
goa
and
is
called
strada
diretta
from
the
singular
fact
that
almost
all
the
streets
in
goa
are
quadrants
or
segments
of
circles
amine
was
astonished
the
houses
were
of
stone
lofty
and
massive
at
each
story
was
thrown
out
a
balcony
of
marble
elaborately
carved
and
over
each
door
were
the
arms
of
the
nobility
or
hidalgos
to
whom
the
houses
belonged
the
square
behind
the
palace
and
the
wide
streets
were
filled
with
living
beings
elephants
with
gorgeous
trappings
led
or
mounted
horses
in
superb
housings
palanquins
carried
by
natives
in
splendid
liveries
running
footmen
syces
every
variety
of
nation
from
the
proud
portuguese
to
the
half-covered
native
mussulmans
arabs
hindoos
armenians
officers
and
soldiers
in
their
uniforms
all
crowded
and
thronged
together--all
was
bustle
and
motion
such
was
the
wealth
the
splendour
and
luxury
of
the
proud
city
of
goa--the
empress
of
the
east
at
the
time
we
are
now
describing
in
half
an
hour
they
forced
their
way
through
the
crowd
and
arrived
at
the
convent
where
amine
was
well
received
by
the
abbess
and
after
a
few
minutes'
conversation
father
mathias
took
his
leave
upon
which
the
abbess
immediately
set
about
her
task
of
conversion
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
order
some
dried
sweetmeats--not
a
bad
beginning
as
they
were
palatable
but
as
she
happened
to
be
very
ignorant
and
unaccustomed
to
theological
disputes
her
subsequent
arguments
did
not
go
down
as
well
as
the
fruit
after
a
rambling
discourse
of
about
an
hour
the
old
lady
felt
tired
and
felt
as
if
she
had
done
wonders
amine
was
then
introduced
to
the
nuns
most
of
whom
were
young
and
all
of
good
family
her
dormitory
was
shown
to
her
and
expressing
a
wish
to
be
alone
she
was
followed
into
her
chamber
by
only
sixteen
of
them
which
was
about
as
many
as
the
chamber
could
well
hold
we
must
pass
over
the
two
months
during
which
amine
remained
in
the
convent
father
mathias
had
taken
every
step
to
ascertain
if
her
husband
had
been
saved
upon
any
of
the
islands
which
were
under
the
portuguese
dominions
but
could
gain
no
information
amine
was
soon
weary
of
the
convent
she
was
persecuted
by
the
harangues
of
the
old
abbess
but
more
disgusted
at
the
conduct
and
conversation
of
the
nuns
they
all
had
secrets
to
confide
to
her--secrets
which
had
been
confided
to
the
whole
convent
before
such
secrets
such
stories
so
different
from
amine's
chaste
ideas--such
impurity
of
thought--that
amine
was
disgusted
at
them
but
how
could
it
be
otherwise
the
poor
creatures
had
been
taken
from
the
world
in
the
full
bloom
of
youth
under
a
ripening
sun
and
had
been
immured
in
this
unnatural
manner
to
gratify
the
avarice
and
pride
of
their
families
its
inmates
being
wholly
composed
of
the
best
families
the
rules
of
this
convent
were
not
so
strict
as
others
licences
were
given--greater
licences
were
taken--and
amine
to
her
surprise
found
that
in
this
society
devoted
to
heaven
there
were
exhibited
more
of
the
bad
passions
of
human
nature
than
she
had
before
met
with
constantly
watched
never
allowed
a
moment
to
herself
her
existence
became
unbearable
and
after
three
months
she
requested
father
mathias
would
find
her
some
other
place
of
refuge
telling
him
frankly
that
her
residence
in
that
place
was
not
very
likely
to
assist
her
conversion
to
the
tenets
of
his
faith
father
mathias
fully
comprehended
her
but
replied
i
have
no
means
here
are
means
replied
amine
taking
the
diamond
ring
from
her
finger
this
is
worth
eight
hundred
ducats
in
our
country
here
i
know
not
how
much
father
mathias
took
the
ring
i
will
call
upon
you
to-morrow
morning
and
let
you
know
what
i
have
done
i
shall
acquaint
the
lady
abbess
that
you
are
going
to
your
husband
for
it
would
not
be
safe
to
let
her
suppose
that
you
have
reasons
for
quitting
the
convent
i
have
heard
what
you
state
mentioned
before
but
have
treated
it
as
scandal
but
you
i
know
are
incapable
of
falsehood
the
next
day
father
mathias
returned
and
had
an
interview
with
the
abbess
who
after
a
time
sent
for
amine
and
told
her
that
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
leave
the
convent
she
consoled
her
as
well
as
she
could
at
leaving
such
a
happy
place
sent
for
some
sweetmeats
to
make
the
parting
less
trying
gave
her
a
blessing
and
made
her
over
to
father
mathias
who
when
they
were
alone
informed
amine
that
he
had
disposed
of
the
ring
for
eighteen
hundred
dollars
and
had
procured
apartments
for
her
in
the
house
of
a
widow
lady
with
whom
she
was
to
board
taking
leave
of
the
nuns
amine
quitted
the
convent
with
father
mathias
and
was
soon
installed
in
her
new
apartments
in
a
house
which
formed
part
of
a
spacious
square
called
the
terra
di
sabaio
after
the
introduction
to
her
hostess
father
mathias
left
her
amine
found
her
apartments
fronting
the
square
airy
and
commodious
the
landlady
who
had
escorted
her
to
view
them
not
having
left
her
she
inquired
what
large
church
that
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
square
it
is
the
ascension
replied
the
lady
the
music
is
very
fine
there
we
will
go
and
hear
it
to-morrow
if
you
please
and
that
massive
building
in
face
of
us
that

the
holy
inquisition
said
the
widow
crossing
herself
amine
again
started
she
knew
not
why
is
that
your
child
said
amine
as
a
boy
of
about
twelve
years
old
entered
the
room

replied
the
widow
the
only
one
that
is
left
me
may
god
preserve
him
the
boy
was
handsome
and
intelligent
and
amine
for
her
own
reasons
did
everything
she
could
to
make
friends
with
him
and
was
successful
amine
had
just
returned
from
an
afternoon's
walk
through
the
streets
of
goa
she
had
made
some
purchases
at
different
shops
in
the
bazaar
and
had
brought
them
home
under
her
mantilla
here
at
last
thank

amine
as
she
threw
herself
on
the
couch

exclaimed
she

means
and

pedro
the
son
of
the
widow
entered
the
room
ran
up
to
amine
and
kissed
her
tell

pedro

the
holy
virgin

you
shall
see
amine
lighted
some
charcoal
in
a
chafing-dish
and
put
it
at
her
feet
she
then
took
a
reed
pen
some
ink
from
a
small
bottle
and
a
pair
of
scissors
and
wrote
down
several
characters
on
a
paper
singing
or
rather
chanting
words
which
were
not
intelligible
to
her
young
companion
amine
then
threw
frankincense
and
coriander
seed
into
the
chafing-dish
which
threw
out
a
strong
aromatic
smoke
and
desiring
pedro
to
sit
down
by
her
on
a
small
stool
she
took
the
boy's
right
hand
and
held
it
in
her
own
she
then
drew
upon
the
palm
of
his
hand
a
square
figure
with
characters
on
each
side
of
it
and
in
the
centre
poured
a
small
quantity
of
the
ink
so
as
to
form
a
black
mirror
of
the
size
of
half
a
crown
now
all
is
ready
said
amine
look
pedro
what
see
you
in
the
ink
my
own
face
replied
the
boy
she
threw
more
frankincense
upon
the
chafing-dish
until
the
room
was
full
of
smoke
and
then
chaunted--
turshoon
turyo-shoon--come
down
come
down
be
present
ye
servants
of
these
names
remove
the
veil
and
be
correct
the
characters
she
had
drawn
upon
the
paper
she
had
divided
with
the
scissors
and
now
taking
one
of
the
pieces
she
dropped
it
into
the
chafing-dish
still
holding
the
boy's
hand
tell
me
now
pedro
what
do
you

i
see
a
man
sweeping
replied
pedro
alarmed
fear
not
pedro
you
shall
see
more
has
he
done
sweeping
yes
he
has
and
amine
muttered
words
which
were
unintelligible
and
threw
into
the
chafing-dish
the
other
half
of
the
paper
with
the
characters
she
had
written
down
say
now
pedro
philip
vanderdecken

philip
vanderdecken

responded
the
boy
trembling
tell
me
what
thou
seest
pedro--tell
me
true
said
amine
anxiously
i
see
a
man
lying
down
on
the
white
sand--i
don't
like
this
play
be
not
alarmed
pedro
you
shall
have
sweetmeats
directly
tell
me
what
thou
seest
how
the
man
is
dressed
he
has
a
short
coat--he
has
white
trowsers--he
looks
about
him--he
takes
something
out
of
his
breast
and
kisses
it
'tis
he
'tis
he
and
he
lives
heaven
i
thank
thee
look

boy

gets
up--i
don't
like
this
play
i
am
frightened
indeed
i
am
fear
not
oh
yes
i
am--i
cannot
replied
pedro
falling
on
his
knees
pray
let
me
go
pedro
had
turned
his
hand
and
spilt
the
ink
the
charm
was
broken
and
amine
could
learn
no
more
she
soothed
the
boy
with
presents
made
him
repeat
his
promise
that
he
would
not
tell
and
postponed
further
search
into
fate
until
the
boy
should
appear
to
have
recovered
from
his
terror
and
be
willing
to
resume
the
ceremonies
my
philip
lives--mother
dear
mother
i
thank
you
amine
did
not
allow
pedro
to
leave
the
room
until
he
appeared
to
have
quite
recovered
from
his
fright
for
some
days
she
did
not
say
anything
to
him
except
to
remind
him
of
his
promise
not
to
tell
his
mother
or
any
one
else
and
she
loaded
him
with
presents
one
afternoon
when
his
mother
was
gone
out
pedro
came
in
and
asked
amine
whether
they
should
not
have
the
play
ever
again
amine
who
was
anxious
to
know
more
was
glad
of
the
boy's
request
and
soon
had
everything
prepared
again
was
her
chamber
filled
with
the
smoke
of
the
frankincense
again
was
she
muttering
her
incantations
the
magic
mirror
was
on
the
boy's
hand
and
once
more
had
pedro
cried
out
philip
vanderdecken
appear
when
the
door
burst
open
and
father
mathias
the
widow
and
several
other
people
made
their
appearance
amine
started
up--pedro
screamed
and
ran
to
his
mother
then
i
was
not
mistaken
at
what
i
saw
in
the
cottage
at
terneuse
cried
father
mathias
with
his
arms
folded
over
his
breast
and
with
looks
of
indignation
accursed
sorceress
you
are
detected
amine
returned
his
gaze
with
scorn
and
coolly
replied
i
am
not
of
your
creed--you
know
it
eaves-dropping
appears
to
be
a
portion
of
your
religion
this
is
my
chamber--it
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
had
to
request
you
to
leave
it--i
do
so
now--you--and
those
who
have
come
in
with
you
take
up
all
those
implements
of
sorcery
first
said
father
mathias
to
his
companions
the
chafing-dish
and
other
articles
used
by
amine
were
taken
away
and
father
mathias
and
the
others
quitting
the
room
amine
was
left
alone
amine
had
a
foreboding
that
she
was
lost
she
knew
that
magic
was
a
crime
of
the
highest
degree
in
catholic
countries
and
that
she
had
been
detected
in
the
very
act
well
well
thought
amine
it
is
my
destiny
and
i
can
brave
the
worst
to
account
for
the
appearance
of
father
mathias
and
the
witnesses
it
must
be
observed
that
the
little
boy
pedro
had
the
day
after
amine's
first
attempt
forgotten
his
promise
and
narrated
to
his
mother
all
that
had
passed
the
widow
frightened
at
what
the
boy
had
told
her
thought
it
right
to
go
to
father
mathias
and
confide
to
him
what
her
son
had
told
her
as
it
was
in
her
opinion
sorcery
father
mathias
questioned
pedro
closely
and
convinced
that
such
was
the
case
determined
to
have
witnesses
to
confront
amine
he
therefore
proposed
that
the
boy
should
appear
to
be
willing
to
try
again
and
had
instructed
him
for
the
purpose
having
previously
arranged
that
they
should
break
in
upon
amine
as
we
have
described
about
half
an
hour
afterwards
two
men
dressed
in
black
gowns
came
into
amine's
room
and
requested
that
she
would
follow
them
or
that
force
would
be
used
amine
made
no
resistance
they
crossed
the
square
the
gate
of
a
large
building
was
opened
they
desired
her
to
walk
in
and
in
a
few
seconds
amine
found
herself
in
one
of
the
dungeons
of
the
inquisition
previous
to
continuing
our
narrative
it
may
be
as
well
to
give
our
readers
some
little
insight
into
the
nature
ceremonies
and
regulations
of
the
inquisition
and
in
describing
that
of
goa
we
may
be
said
to
describe
all
others
with
very
trifling
if
any
variation
the
santa
casa
or
inquisition
of
goa
is
situated
on
one
side
of
a
large
square
called
the
terra
di
sabaio
it
is
a
massy
handsome
pile
of
stone
buildings
with
three
doors
in
the
front
the
centre
one
is
larger
than
the
two
lateral
and
it
is
through
the
centre
door
that
you
go
into
the
hall
of
judgment
the
side-doors
lead
to
spacious
and
handsome
apartments
for
the
inquisitors
and
officers
attached
to
the
establishment
behind
these
apartments
are
the
cells
and
dungeons
of
the
inquisition
they
are
in
two
long
galleries
with
double
doors
to
each
and
are
about
ten
feet
square
there
are
about
two
hundred
of
them
some
are
much
more
comfortable
than
the
others
as
light
and
air
are
admitted
into
them
the
others
are
wholly
dark
in
the
galleries
the
keepers
watch
and
not
a
word
or
a
sound
can
proceed
from
any
cell
without
their
being
able
to
overhear
it
the
treatment
of
those
confined
is
as
far
as
respects
their
food
very
good
great
care
is
taken
that
the
nourishment
is
of
that
nature
that
the
prisoners
may
not
suffer
from
the
indigestion
arising
from
want
of
exercise
surgical
attendance
is
also
permitted
them
but
unless
on
very
particular
occasions
no
priests
are
allowed
to
enter
any
consolation
to
be
derived
from
religion
even
the
office
of
confessor
and
extreme
unction
in
case
of
dissolution
are
denied
them
should
they
die
during
their
confinement
whether
proved
guilty
or
not
of
the
crime
of
which
they
are
accused
they
are
buried
without
any
funeral
ceremony
and
tried
afterwards
if
then
found
guilty
their
bones
are
disinterred
and
the
execution
of
their
sentence
is
passed
upon
their
remains
there
are
two
inquisitors
at
goa
one
the
grand
inquisitor
and
the
other
his
second
who
are
invariably
chosen
from
the
order
of
st
dominique
these
two
are
assisted
in
their
judgment
and
examinations
by
a
large
number
selected
from
the
religious
orders
who
are
termed
deputies
of
the
holy
office
but
who
only
attend
when
summoned
they
have
other
officers
whose
duty
it
is
to
examine
all
published
books
and
ascertain
if
there
is
anything
in
their
pages
contrary
to
the
holy
religion
there
is
also
a
public
accuser
a
procureur
of
the
inquisition
and
lawyers
who
are
permitted
to
plead
the
case
of
the
prisoners
but
whose
chief
business
and
interest
it
is
to
obtain
their
secrets
and
betray
them
what
are
termed
familiars
of
the
inquisition
are
in
fact
nothing
but
this
description
of
people
but
this
disgraceful
office
is
taken
upon
themselves
by
the
highest
nobility
who
think
it
an
honour
as
well
as
a
security
to
be
enrolled
among
the
familiars
of
the
inquisition
who
are
thus
to
be
found
dispersed
throughout
society
and
every
careless
word
or
expression
is
certain
to
be
repeated
to
the
holy
office
a
summons
to
attend
at
the
inquisition
is
never
opposed
if
it
were
the
whole
populace
would
rise
and
enforce
it
those
who
are
confined
in
the
dungeons
of
the
inquisition
are
kept
separate
it
is
a
very
uncommon
thing
to
put
two
together
it
is
only
done
when
it
is
considered
that
the
prolonged
solitude
of
the
dungeon
has
created
such
a
depression
of
spirits
as
to
endanger
the
life
of
the
party
perpetual
silence
is
enjoined
and
strictly
kept
those
who
wail
or
weep
or
even
pray
in
their
utter
darkness
are
forced
by
blows
to
be
quiet
the
cries
and
shrieks
of
those
who
suffer
from
this
chastisement
or
from
the
torture
are
carried
along
the
whole
length
of
the
corridors
terrifying
those
who
in
solitude
and
darkness
are
anticipating
the
same
fate
the
first
question
put
to
a
person
arrested
by
the
inquisition
is
a
demand
what
is
his
property
he
is
desired
to
make
an
exact
declaration
of
everything
that
he
is
worth
and
swear
to
the
truth
of
his
assertions
being
informed
that
if
there
is
any
reservation
on
his
part
although
he
may
be
at
that
time
innocent
of
the
charges
produced
against
him
he
will
by
his
concealment
have
incurred
the
wrath
of
the
inquisition
and
that
if
discharged
for
the
crime
he
is
accused
of
he
will
again
be
arrested
for
having
taken
a
false
oath
to
the
inquisition
that
if
innocent
his
property
will
be
safe
and
not
interfered
with
it
is
not
without
reason
that
this
demand
is
made
if
a
person
accused
confesses
his
crime
he
is
in
most
cases
eventually
allowed
to
go
free
but
all
his
property
becomes
confiscated
by
the
rules
of
the
inquisition
it
is
made
to
appear
as
if
those
condemned
have
the
show
of
justice
for
although
two
witnesses
are
sufficient
to
warrant
the
apprehension
of
any
individual
seven
are
necessary
to
convict
him
but
as
the
witnesses
are
never
confronted
with
the
prisoners
and
torture
is
often
applied
to
the
witnesses
it
is
not
difficult
to
obtain
the
number
required
many
a
life
is
falsely
sworn
away
by
the
witness
that
he
may
save
his
own
the
chief
crimes
which
are
noticed
by
the
inquisition
are
those
of
sorcery
heresy
blasphemy
and
what
is
called
judaism
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
this
last
crime
for
which
more
people
have
suffered
from
the
inquisition
than
for
any
other
the
reader
must
be
informed
that
when
ferdinand
and
isabella
of
castile
drove
all
the
jews
out
of
spain
they
fled
to
portugal
where
they
were
received
on
the
sole
condition
that
they
should
embrace
christianity
this
they
consented
or
appeared
to
consent
to
do
but
these
converts
were
despised
by
the
portuguese
people
who
did
not
believe
them
to
be
sincere
they
obtained
the
title
of
new
christians
in
contradistinction
to
that
of
old
christians
after
a
time
the
two
were
occasionally
intermingled
in
marriage
but
when
so
it
was
always
a
reproach
to
the
old
families
and
descendants
from
these
alliances
were
long
termed
by
way
of
reproach
as
having
a
portion
of
the
new
christians
in
them
the
descendants
of
the
old
families
thus
intermingled
not
only
lost
caste
but
as
the
genealogy
of
every
family
was
well
known
they
were
looked
upon
with
suspicion
and
were
always
at
the
mercy
of
the
holy
office
when
denounced
for
judaism--that
is
for
returning
to
the
old
jewish
practices
of
keeping
the
passover
and
the
other
ceremonies
enforced
by
moses
let
us
see
how
an
accusation
of
this
kind
works
in
the
hands
of
the
inquisition
a
really
sincere
catholic
descended
from
one
of
these
unhappy
families
is
accused
and
arrested
by
the
orders
of
the
inquisition
he
is
ordered
to
declare
his
property
which--convinced
of
his
innocence
and
expecting
soon
to
be
released
he
does
without
reservation
but
hardly
has
the
key
of
the
dungeon
turned
upon
him
when
all
his
effects
are
seized
and
sold
by
public
auction
it
being
well
understood
that
they
never
will
be
restored
to
him
after
some
months'
confinement
he
is
called
into
the
hall
of
justice
and
asked
if
he
knows
why
he
is
in
prison
they
advise
him
earnestly
to
confess
and
to
conceal
nothing
as
it
is
the
only
way
by
which
he
can
obtain
his
liberty
he
declares
his
ignorance
and
being
sent
for
several
times
persists
in
it
the
period
of
the
auto-da-fe
or
act
of
faith
which
takes
place
every
two
or
three
years
that
is
the
public
execution
of
those
who
have
been
found
guilty
by
the
inquisition
approaches
the
public
accuser
then
comes
forward
stating
that
the
prisoner
has
been
accused
by
a
number
of
witnesses
of
judaism
they
persuade
him
to
acknowledge
his
guilt
he
persists
in
his
innocence
they
then
pass
a
sentence
on
him
which
they
term
convicte
invotivo
which
means
found
guilty
but
will
not
confess
his
crime
and
he
is
sentenced
to
be
burnt
at
the
approaching
celebration
after
this
they
follow
him
to
his
cell
and
exhort
him
to
confess
his
guilt
and
promise
that
if
he
does
confess
he
shall
be
pardoned
and
these
appeals
are
continued
until
the
evening
of
the
day
before
his
execution
terrified
at
the
idea
of
a
painful
death
the
wretch
at
last
to
save
his
life
consents
he
is
called
into
the
hall
of
judgment
confesses
the
crime
that
he
has
not
committed
and
imagines
that
he
is
now
saved--alas
now
he
has
entangled
himself
and
cannot
escape
you
acknowledge
that
you
have
been
guilty
of
observing
the
laws
of
moses
these
ceremonies
cannot
be
performed
alone
you
cannot
have
eaten
the
paschal
lamb
alone
tell
us
immediately
who
were
those
who
assisted
at
those
ceremonies
or
your
life
is
still
forfeited
and
the
stake
is
prepared
for
you
thus
has
he
accused
himself
without
gaining
anything
and
if
he
wishes
to
save
his
life
he
must
accuse
others
and
who
can
be
accused
but
his
own
friends
and
acquaintances
nay
in
all
probability
his
own
relations--his
brothers
sisters
wife
sons
or
daughters--for
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
in
all
such
practices
a
man
will
trust
only
his
own
family
whether
a
man
confesses
his
guilt
or
dies
asserting
his
innocence
his
worldly
property
is
in
either
case
confiscated
but
it
is
of
great
consequence
to
the
inquisition
that
he
should
confess
as
his
act
of
confession
with
his
signature
annexed
is
publicly
read
and
serves
to
prove
to
the
world
that
the
inquisition
is
impartial
and
just
nay
more
even
merciful
as
it
pardons
those
who
have
been
proved
to
be
guilty
at
goa
the
accusations
of
sorcery
and
magic
were
much
more
frequent
than
at
the
inquisitions
at
other
places
arising
from
the
customs
and
ceremonies
of
the
hindoos
being
very
much
mixed
up
with
absurd
superstitions
these
people
and
the
slaves
from
other
parts
very
often
embraced
christianity
to
please
their
masters
but
since
if
they
had
been
baptised
and
were
afterwards
convicted
of
any
crime
they
were
sentenced
to
the
punishment
by
fire
whereas
if
they
had
not
been
baptised
they
were
only
punished
by
whipping
imprisonment
or
the
galleys
upon
this
ground
alone
many
refused
to
embrace
christianity
we
have
now
detailed
all
that
we
consider
up
to
the
present
necessary
for
the
information
of
the
reader
all
that
is
omitted
he
will
gather
as
we
proceed
with
our
history
a
few
hours
after
amine
had
been
in
the
dungeon
the
jailors
entered
without
speaking
to
her
they
let
down
her
soft
silky
hair
and
cut
it
close
off
amine
with
her
lip
curled
in
contempt
and
without
resistance
and
expostulation
allowed
them
to
do
their
work
they
finished
and
she
was
again
left
to
her
solitude
the
next
day
the
jailors
entered
her
cell
and
ordered
her
to
bare
her
feet
and
follow
them
she
looked
at
them
and
they
at
her
if
you
do
not
we
must
observed
one
of
the
men
who
was
moved
by
her
youth
and
beauty
amine
did
as
she
was
desired
and
was
led
into
the
hall
of
justice
where
she
found
only
the
grand
inquisitor
and
the
secretary
the
hall
of
justice
was
a
long
room
with
lofty
windows
on
each
side
and
also
at
the
end
opposite
to
the
door
through
which
she
had
been
led
in
in
the
centre
on
a
raised
dais
was
a
long
table
covered
with
a
cloth
of
alternate
blue
and
fawn
coloured
stripes
and
at
the
end
opposite
to
where
amine
was
brought
in
was
raised
an
enormous
crucifix
with
a
carved
image
of
our
saviour
the
jailor
pointed
to
a
small
bench
and
intimated
to
amine
that
she
was
to
sit
down
after
a
scrutiny
of
some
moments
the
secretary
spoke--
what
is
your
name
amine
vanderdecken
of
what
country
my
husband
is
of
the
low
countries
i
am
from
the
east
what
is
your
husband
the
captain
of
a
dutch
indiaman
how
came
you
here
his
vessel
was
wrecked
and
we
were
separated
whom
do
you
know
here
father
mathias
what
property
have
you
none
it
is
my
husband's
where
is
it
in
the
custody
of
father
mathias
are
you
aware
why
you
are
brought
here
how
should
i
be
replied
amine
evasively
tell
me
what
i
am
accused
of
you
must
know
whether
you
have
done
wrong
or
not
you
had
better
confess
all
your
conscience
accuses
you
of
my
conscience
does
not
accuse
me
of
doing
anything
then
you
will
confess
nothing
by
your
own
showing
i
have
nothing
to
confess
you
say
you
are
from
the
east
are
you
a
christian
i
reject
your
creed
you
are
married
to
a
catholic
yes
a
true
catholic
who
married
you
father
seysen
a
catholic
priest
did
you
enter
into
the
bosom
of
the
church--did
he
venture
to
marry
you
without
your
being
baptised
some
ceremony
did
take
place
which
i
consented
to
it
was
baptism
was
it
not
i
believe
it
was
so
termed
and
now
you
say
that
you
reject
the
creed
since
i
have
witnessed
the
conduct
of
those
who
profess
it
i
do
at
the
time
of
my
marriage
i
was
disposed
towards
it
what
is
the
amount
of
your
property
in
the
father
mathias's
hands
some
hundreds
of
dollars--he
knows
exactly
the
grand
inquisitor
rang
a
bell
the
jailors
entered
and
amine
was
led
back
to
her
dungeon
why
should
they
ask
so
often
about
my
money
mused
amine
if
they
require
it
they
may
take
it
what
is
their
power
what
would
they
do
with
me
well
well
a
few
days
will
decide
a
few
days--no
no
amine
years
perhaps
would
have
passed
without
decision
but
that
in
our
months
from
the
date
of
your
incarceration
the
auto-da-fe
which
had
not
been
celebrated
for
upwards
of
three
years
was
to
take
place
and
there
was
not
a
sufficient
number
of
those
who
were
to
undergo
the
last
punishment
to
render
the
ceremony
imposing
a
few
more
were
required
for
the
stake
or
you
would
not
have
escaped
from
those
dungeons
so
soon
as
it
was
a
month
of
anxiety
and
suspense
almost
insupportable
had
to
be
passed
away
before
amine
was
again
summoned
to
the
hall
of
justice
amine
at
the
time
we
have
specified
was
again
introduced
to
the
hall
of
justice
and
was
again
asked
if
she
would
confess
irritated
at
her
long
confinement
and
the
injustice
of
the
proceedings
she
replied
i
have
told
you
once
for
all
that
i
have
nothing
to
confess
do
with
me
as
you
will
but
be
quick
will
torture
oblige
you
to
confess
try
me
replied
amine
firmly
try
me
cruel
men
and
if
you
gain
but
one
word
from
me
then
call
me
craven
i
am
but
a
woman
but
i
dare
you--i
defy
you
it
was
seldom
that
such
expressions
fell
upon
the
ears
of
her
judges
and
still
more
seldom
that
a
countenance
was
lighted
up
with
such
determination
but
the
torture
was
never
applied
until
after
the
accusation
had
been
made
and
answered
we
shall
see
said
the
grand
inquisitor
take
her
away
amine
was
led
back
to
her
cell
in
the
mean
time
father
mathias
had
had
several
conferences
with
the
inquisitor
although
in
his
wrath
he
had
accused
amine
and
had
procured
the
necessary
witnesses
against
her
he
now
felt
uneasy
and
perplexed
his
long
residence
with
her--her
invariable
kindness
till
the
time
of
his
dismissal--his
knowledge
that
she
had
never
embraced
the
faith--her
boldness
and
courage--nay
her
beauty
and
youth--all
worked
strongly
in
her
favour
his
only
object
now
was
to
persuade
her
to
confess
that
she
was
wrong
induce
her
to
embrace
the
faiths
and
save
her
with
this
view
he
had
obtained
permission
from
the
holy
office
to
enter
her
dungeon
and
reason
with
her--a
special
favour
which
for
many
reasons
they
could
not
well
refuse
him
it
was
on
the
third
day
after
her
second
examination
that
the
bolts
were
removed
at
an
unusual
hour
and
father
mathias
entered
the
cell
which
was
again
barred
and
he
was
left
alone
with
amine
my
child
my
child
exclaimed
father
mathias
with
sorrow
in
his
countenance
nay
father
this
is
mockery
it
is
you
who
brought
me
here--leave
me
i
brought
you
here
'tis
true
but
i
would
now
remove
you
if
you
will
permit
me
amine
most
willingly
i'll
follow
you
nay
nay
there
is
much
to
talk
over
much
to
be
done
this
is
not
a
dungeon
from
which
people
can
escape
so
easily
then
tell
me
what
have
you
to
say
and
what
is
it
must
be
done
i
will
but
stop
before
you
say
one
word
answer
me
one
question
as
you
hope
for
bliss
have
you
heard
aught
of
philip
yes
i
have
he
is
well
and
where
is
he
he
will
soon
be
here
god
i
thank
thee
shall
i
see
him
father
that
must
depend
upon
yourself
upon
myself
then
tell
me
quickly
what
would
they
have
me
do
confess
your
sins--your
crimes
what
sins--what
crimes
have
you
not
dealt
with
evil
beings
invoked
the
spirits
and
gained
the
assistance
of
those
who
are
not
of
this
world
amine
made
no
reply
answer
me
do
you
not
confess
i
do
not
confess
to
have
done
anything
wrong
this
is
useless
you
were
seen
by
me
and
others
what
will
avail
your
denial
are
you
aware
of
the
punishment
which
most
surely
awaits
you
if
you
do
not
confess
and
become
a
member
of
our
church
why
am
i
to
become
a
member
of
your
church
do
you
then
punish
those
who
refuse
no
had
you
not
already
consented
to
receive
baptism
you
would
not
have
been
asked
to
become
so
but
having
been
baptised
you
must
now
become
a
member
or
be
supposed
to
fall
back
into
heresy
i
knew
not
the
nature
of
your
baptism
at
that
time
granted
but
you
consented
to
it
be
it
so
but
pray
what
may
be
the
punishment
if
i
refuse
you
will
be
burnt
alive
at
the
stake
nothing
can
save
you
hear
me
amine
vanderdecken
when
next
summoned
you
must
confess
all
and
asking
pardon
request
to
be
received
into
the
church
then
will
you
be
saved
and
you
will--
what
again
be
clasped
in
philip's
arms
my
philip--my
philip--you
indeed
press
me
hard
but
father
if
i
confess
i
am
wrong
when
i
feel
that
i
am
not--
feel
that
you
are
not
yes
i
invoked
my
mother's
assistance
she
gave
it
me
in
a
dream
would
a
mother
have
assisted
her
daughter
if
it
were
wrong
it
was
not
your
mother
but
a
fiend
who
took
the
likeness
it
was
my
mother
again
you
ask
me
to
say
that
i
believe
that
which
i
cannot
that
which
you
cannot
amine
vanderdecken
be
not
obstinate
i
am
not
obstinate
good
father
have
you
not
offered
me
what
is
to
me
beyond
all
price
that
i
should
again
be
in
the
arms
of
my
husband
can
i
degrade
myself
to
a
lie--not
for
life
or
liberty
or
even
for
my
philip
amine
vanderdecken
if
you
will
confess
your
crime
before
you
are
accused
you
will
have
done
much
after
your
accusation
has
been
made
it
will
be
of
little
avail
it
will
not
be
done
either
before
or
after
father
what
i
have
done
i
have
done
but
a
crime
it
is
not
to
me
and
mine--with
you
it
may
be
but
i
am
not
of
yours
recollect
also
that
you
peril
your
husband
for
having
wedded
with
a
sorceress
forget
not
to-morrow
i
will
see
you
again
my
mind
is
troubled
replied
amine
leave
me
father
it
will
be
a
kindness
father
mathias
quitted
the
cell
pleased
with
the
last
words
of
amine
the
idea
of
her
husband's
danger
seemed
to
have
startled
her
amine
threw
herself
down
on
the
mattress
in
the
corner
of
the
cell
and
hid
her
face
burnt
alive
exclaimed
she
after
a
time
sitting
up
and
passing
her
hands
over
her
forehead
burnt
alive
and
these
are
christians
this
then
was
the
cruel
death
foretold
by
that
creature
schriften--
foretold--yes
and
therefore
must
be--it
is
my
destiny--i
cannot
save
myself
if
i
confess
then
i
confess
that
philip
is
wedded
to
a
sorceress
and
he
will
be
punished
too
no
never--never
i
can
suffer
'tis
cruel--'tis
horrible
to
think
of--but
'twill
soon
be
over
god
of
my
fathers
give
me
strength
against
these
wicked
men
and
enable
me
to
hear
all
for
my
dear
philip's
sake
the
next
evening
father
mathias
again
made
his
appearance
he
found
amine
calm
and
collected
she
refused
to
listen
to
his
advice
or
follow
his
injunctions
his
last
observation
that
her
husband
would
be
in
peril
if
she
was
found
guilty
of
sorcery
had
steeled
her
heart
and
she
had
determined
that
neither
torture
nor
the
stake
should
make
her
confess
the
act
the
priest
left
the
cell
sick
at
heart
he
now
felt
miserable
at
the
idea
of
amine's
perishing
by
so
dreadful
a
death
accused
himself
of
precipitation
and
wished
that
he
had
never
seen
amine
whose
constancy
and
courage
although
in
error
excited
his
admiration
and
his
pity
and
then
he
thought
of
philip
who
had
treated
him
so
kindly--how
could
he
meet
him
and
if
he
asked
for
his
wife
what
answer
could
he
give
another
fortnight
passed
when
amine
was
again
summoned
to
the
hall
of
judgment
and
again
asked
if
she
confessed
her
crimes
upon
her
refusal
the
accusations
against
her
were
read
she
was
accused
by
father
mathias
with
practising
forbidden
arts
and
the
depositions
of
the
boy
pedro
and
the
other
witnesses
were
read
in
his
zeal
father
mathias
also
stated
that
he
had
found
her
guilty
of
the
same
practices
at
terneuse
and
moreover
that
in
the
violent
storm
when
all
expected
to
perish
she
had
remained
calm
and
courageous
and
told
the
captain
that
they
would
be
saved
which
could
only
have
been
known
by
an
undue
spirit
of
prophecy
given
by
evil
spirits
amine's
lip
curled
in
derision
when
she
heard
the
last
accusation
she
was
asked
if
she
had
any
defence
to
make
what
defence
can
be
offered
replied
she
to
such
accusations
as
these
witness
the
last--because
i
was
not
so
craven
as
the
christians
i
am
accused
of
sorcery
the
old
dotard
but
i
will
expose
him
tell
me
if
one
knows
that
sorcery
is
used
and
conceals
or
allows
it
is
he
not
a
participator
and
equally
guilty
he
is
replied
the
inquisitor
anxiously
awaiting
the
result
then
i
denounce--
and
amine
was
about
to
reveal
that
philip's
mission
was
known
and
not
forbidden
by
fathers
mathias
and
seysen
when
recollecting
that
philip
would
be
implicated
she
stopped
denounce
whom
inquired
the
inquisitor
no
one
replied
amine
folding
her
arms
and
dropping
her
head
speak
woman
amine
made
no
answer
the
torture
will
make
you
speak
never
replied
amine
never
torture
me
to
death
if
you
choose
i
prefer
it
to
a
public
execution
the
inquisitor
and
the
secretary
consulted
a
short
time
convinced
that
amine
would
adhere
to
her
resolution
and
requiring
her
for
public
execution
they
abandoned
the
idea
of
the
torture
do
you
confess
inquired
the
inquisitor
no
replied
amine
firmly
then
take
her
away
the
night
before
the
auto-da-fe
father
mathias
again
entered
the
cell
of
amine
but
all
his
endeavours
to
convert
her
were
useless
to-morrow
will
end
it
all
father
replied
amine
leave
me--i
would
be
alone
we
must
now
return
to
philip
and
krantz
when
the
latter
retired
from
the
presence
of
the
portuguese
commandant
he
communicated
to
philip
what
had
taken
place
and
the
fabulous
tale
which
he
had
invented
to
deceive
the
commandant
i
said
that
you
alone
knew
where
the
treasure
was
concealed
continued
krantz
that
you
might
be
sent
for
for
in
all
probability
he
will
keep
me
as
a
hostage
but
never
mind
that
i
must
take
my
chance
do
you
contrive
to
escape
somehow
or
other
and
rejoin
amine
not
so
rejoined
philip
you
must
go
with
me
my
friend
i
feel
that
should
i
part
with
you
happiness
would
no
longer
be
in
store
for
me
nonsense--that
is
but
an
idle
feeling
besides
i
will
evade
him
somehow
or
another
i
will
not
show
the
treasure
unless
you
go
with
me
well
you
may
try
it
at
all
events
a
low
tap
at
the
door
was
heard
philip
rose
and
opened
it
for
they
had
retired
to
rest
and
pedro
came
in
looking
carefully
round
him
and
then
shutting
the
door
softly
he
put
his
finger
on
his
lips
to
enjoin
them
to
silence
he
then
in
a
whisper
told
them
what
he
had
overheard
contrive
if
possible
that
i
go
with
you
continued
he
i
must
leave
you
now
he
still
paces
his
room
and
pedro
slipped
out
of
the
door
and
crawled
stealthily
away
along
the
ramparts
the
treacherous
little
rascal
but
we
will
circumvent
him
if
possible
said
krantz
in
a
low
tone
yes
philip
you
are
right
we
must
both
go
for
you
will
require
my
assistance
i
must
persuade
him
to
go
himself
i'll
think
of
it--so
philip
good
night
the
next
morning
philip
and
krantz
were
summoned
to
breakfast
the
commandant
received
them
with
smiles
and
urbanity
to
philip
he
was
peculiarly
courteous
as
soon
as
the
repast
was
over
he
thus
communicated
to
him
his
intentions
and
wishes--
signor
i
have
been
reflecting
upon
what
your
friend
told
me
and
the
appearance
of
the
spectre
yesterday
which
created
such
confusion
it
induced
me
to
behave
with
a
rashness
for
which
i
must
now
offer
my
most
sincere
apologies
the
reflections
which
i
have
made
joined
with
the
feelings
of
devotion
which
must
be
in
the
heart
of
every
true
catholic
have
determined
me
with
your
assistance
to
obtain
this
treasure
dedicated
to
the
holy
church
it
is
my
proposal
that
you
should
take
a
party
of
soldiers
under
your
orders
proceed
to
the
island
on
which
it
is
deposited
and
having
obtained
it
return
here
i
will
detain
any
vessel
which
may
in
the
mean
time
put
into
the
roadstead
and
you
shall
then
be
the
bearers
of
the
treasure
and
of
my
letters
to
goa
this
will
give
you
an
honourable
introduction
to
the
authorities
and
enable
you
to
pass
away
your
time
there
in
the
most
agreeable
manner
you
will
also
signor
be
restored
to
your
wife
whose
charms
had
such
an
effect
upon
me
and
for
mention
of
whose
name
in
the
very
unceremonious
manner
which
i
did
i
must
excuse
myself
upon
the
ground
of
total
ignorance
of
who
she
was
or
of
her
being
in
any
way
connected
with
your
honourable
person
if
these
measures
suit
you
signor
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
give
orders
to
that
effect
as
a
good
catholic
myself
replied
philip
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
point
out
the
spot
where
the
treasure
is
concealed
and
restore
it
to
the
church
your
apologies
relative
to
my
wife
i
accept
with
pleasure
being
aware
that
your
conduct
proceeded
from
ignorance
of
her
situation
and
rank
but
i
do
not
exactly
see
my
way
clear
you
propose
a
party
of
soldiers
will
they
obey
me
are
they
to
be
trusted
i
shall
have
only
myself
and
friend
against
them
and
will
they
be
obedient
no
fear
of
that
signor
they
are
well
disciplined
there
is
not
even
occasion
for
your
friend
to
go
with
you
i
wish
to
retain
him
with
me
to
keep
me
company
during
your
absence
nay
that
i
must
object
to
replied
philip
i
will
not
trust
myself
alone
perhaps
i
may
be
allowed
to
give
an
opinion
on
this
subject
observed
krantz
i
see
no
reason
if
my
friend
goes
accompanied
within
a
party
of
soldiers
only
why
i
should
not
go
with
him
but
i
consider
it
would
be
unadvisable
that
he
proceed
in
the
way
the
commandant
proposes
either
with
or
without
me
you
must
recollect
commandant
that
it
is
no
trifling
sum
which
is
to
be
carried
away
that
it
will
be
open
to
view
and
will
meet
the
eyes
of
your
men
that
these
men
have
been
detained
many
years
in
this
country
and
are
anxious
to
return
home
when
therefore
they
find
themselves
with
only
two
strangers
with
them--away
from
your
authority
and
in
possession
of
a
large
sum
of
money--will
not
the
temptation
be
too
strong
they
will
only
have
to
run
down
the
southern
channel
gain
the
port
of
bantam
and
they
will
be
safe
having
obtained
both
freedom
and
wealth
to
send
therefore
my
friend
and
me
would
be
to
send
us
to
almost
certain
death
but
if
you
were
to
go
commandant
then
the
danger
would
no
longer
exist
your
presence
and
your
authority
would
control
them
and
whatever
their
wishes
or
thoughts
might
be
they
would
quail
before
the
flash
of
your
eye
very
true--very
true
replied
philip--all
this
did
not
occur
to
me
nor
had
it
occurred
to
the
commandant
but
when
pointed
out
the
force
of
these
suggestions
immediately
struck
him
and
long
before
krantz
had
finished
speaking
he
had
resolved
to
go
himself
well
signors
replied
he
i
am
always
ready
to
accede
to
your
wishes
and
since
you
consider
my
presence
necessary
and
as
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
chance
of
another
attack
from
the
ternate
people
just
now
i
will
take
upon
myself
the
responsibility
of
leaving
the
fort
for
a
few
days
under
the
charge
of
my
lieutenant
while
we
do
this
service
to
holy
mother
church
i
have
already
sent
for
one
of
the
native
vessels
which
are
large
and
commodious
and
will
with
your
permission
embark
to-morrow
two
vessels
will
be
better
observed
krantz
in
the
first
place
in
case
of
an
accident
and
next
because
we
can
embark
all
the
treasure
in
one
with
ourselves
and
put
a
portion
of
the
soldiers
in
the
other
so
that
we
may
be
in
greater
force
in
case
of
the
sight
of
so
much
wealth
stimulating
them
to
insubordination
true
signor
we
will
have
two
vessels
your
advice
is
good
everything
was
thus
satisfactorily
arranged
with
the
exception
of
their
wish
that
pedro
should
accompany
them
on
their
expedition
they
were
debating
how
this
should
be
brought
on
the
tapis
when
the
soldier
came
to
them
and
stated
that
the
commandant
had
ordered
him
to
be
of
the
party
and
that
he
was
to
offer
his
services
to
the
two
strangers
on
the
ensuing
day
everything
was
prepared
ten
soldiers
and
a
corporal
had
been
selected
by
the
commandant
and
it
required
but
little
time
to
put
into
the
vessels
the
provisions
and
other
articles
which
were
required
at
daylight
they
embarked--the
commandant
and
philip
in
one
boat
krantz
with
the
corporal
and
pedro
in
the
other
the
men
who
had
been
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
object
of
the
expedition
were
now
made
acquainted
with
it
by
pedro
and
a
long
whispering
took
place
between
them
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
krantz
who
was
aware
that
the
mutiny
would
soon
be
excited
when
it
was
understood
that
those
who
composed
the
expedition
were
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
avarice
of
the
commandant
the
weather
being
fine
they
sailed
on
during
the
night
passed
the
island
of
ternate
at
ten
leagues'
distance
and
before
morning
were
among
the
cluster
of
isles
the
southernmost
of
which
was
the
one
on
which
the
treasure
had
been
buried
on
the
second
night
the
vessels
were
beached
upon
a
small
island
and
then
for
the
first
time
a
communication
took
place
between
the
soldiers
who
had
been
in
the
boat
with
pedro
and
krantz
and
those
who
had
been
embarked
with
the
commandant
philip
and
krantz
had
also
an
opportunity
of
communicating
apart
for
a
short
time
when
they
made
sail
the
next
morning
pedro
spoke
openly
he
told
krantz
that
the
soldiers
in
the
boat
had
made
up
their
minds
and
that
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
others
would
do
so
before
night
although
they
had
not
decidedly
agreed
upon
joining
them
in
the
morning
when
they
had
re-embarked
that
they
would
despatch
the
commandant
and
then
proceed
to
batavia
and
from
thence
obtain
a
passage
home
to
europe
cannot
you
accomplish
your
end
without
murder
yes
we
could
but
not
our
revenge
you
do
not
know
the
treatment
which
we
have
received
from
his
hands
and
sweet
as
the
money
will
be
to
us
his
death
will
be
even
sweeter
besides
has
he
not
determined
to
murder
us
all
in
some
way
or
another
it
is
but
justice
no
no
if
there
was
no
other
knife
ready--mine
is
and
so
are
all
ours
cried
the
other
soldiers
putting
their
hands
to
their
weapons
one
more
day's
sail
brought
them
within
twenty
miles
of
the
island
for
philip
knew
his
landmarks
well
again
they
handed
and
all
retired
to
rest
the
commandant
dreaming
of
wealth
and
revenge
while
it
was
arranging
that
the
digging
up
of
the
treasure
which
he
coveted
should
be
the
signal
for
his
death
once
more
did
they
embark
and
the
commandant
heeded
not
the
dark
and
lowering
faces
with
which
he
was
surrounded
he
was
all
gaiety
and
politeness
swiftly
did
they
skim
over
the
dark-blue
sea
between
the
beautiful
islands
with
which
it
was
studded
and
before
the
sun
was
three
hours
high
philip
recognised
the
one
sought
after
and
pointed
out
to
the
commandant
the
notched
cocoa-nut
tree
which
served
as
a
guide
to
the
spot
where
the
money
had
been
concealed
they
landed
on
the
sandy
beach
and
the
shovels
were
ordered
to
be
brought
on
shore
by
the
impatient
little
officer
who
little
thought
that
every
moment
of
time
gained
was
but
so
much
time
lost
to
him
and
that
while
he
was
smiling
and
meditating
treachery
that
others
could
do
the
same
the
party
arrived
under
the
tree--the
shovels
soon
removed
the
light
sand
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
treasure
was
exposed
to
view
bag
after
bag
was
handed
up
and
the
loose
dollars
collected
into
heaps
two
of
the
soldiers
had
been
sent
to
the
vessels
for
sacks
to
put
the
loose
dollars
in
and
the
men
had
desisted
from
their
labour
they
laid
aside
their
spades
looks
were
exchanged
and
all
were
ready
the
commandant
turned
round
to
call
to
and
hasten
the
movements
of
the
men
who
had
been
sent
for
the
sacks
when
three
or
four
knives
simultaneously
pierced
him
through
the
back
he
fell
and
was
expostulating
when
they
were
again
buried
in
his
bosom
and
he
lay
a
corpse
philip
and
krantz
remained
silent
spectators--the
knives
were
drawn
out
wiped
and
replaced
in
their
sheaths
he
has
met
his
reward
said
krantz
yes
exclaimed
the
portuguese
soldiers--justice
nothing
but
justice
signors
you
shall
have
your
share
observed
pedro
shall
they
not
my
men
yes
yes
not
one
dollar
my
good
friends
replied
philip
take
all
the
money
and
may
you
be
happy
all
we
ask
is
your
assistance
to
proceed
on
our
way
to
where
we
are
about
to
go
and
now
before
you
divide
your
money
oblige
me
by
burying
the
body
of
that
unfortunate
man
the
soldiers
obeyed
resuming
their
shovels
they
soon
scooped
out
a
shallow
grave
the
commandant's
body
was
thrown
in
and
covered
up
from
sight
scarcely
had
the
soldiers
performed
their
task
and
thrown
down
their
shovels
when
they
commenced
an
altercation
it
appeared
that
this
money
was
to
be
again
the
cause
of
slaughter
and
bloodshed
philip
and
krantz
determined
to
sail
immediately
in
one
of
the
peroquas
and
leave
them
to
settle
their
disputes
as
they
pleased
he
asked
permission
of
the
soldiers
to
take
from
the
provisions
and
water
of
which
there
was
ample
supply
a
larger
proportion
than
was
their
share
stating
that
he
and
krantz
had
a
long
voyage
and
would
require
it
and
pointing
out
to
them
that
there
were
plenty
of
cocoa-nuts
for
their
support
the
soldiers
who
thought
of
nothing
but
their
newly-acquired
wealth
allowed
him
to
do
as
he
pleased
and
having
hastily
collected
as
many
cocoa-nuts
as
they
could
to
add
to
their
stock
of
provisions
before
noon
philip
and
krantz
had
embarked
and
made
sail
in
the
peroqua
leaving
the
soldiers
with
their
knives
again
drawn
and
so
busy
in
their
angry
altercation
as
to
be
heedless
of
their
departure
there
will
be
the
same
scene
over
again
i
expect
observed
krantz
as
the
vessel
parted
swiftly
from
the
shore
i
have
little
doubt
of
it
observe
even
now
they
are
at
blows
and
stabs
if
i
were
to
name
that
spot
it
should
be
the
accursed
isle'
would
not
any
other
be
the
same
with
so
much
to
inflame
the
passions
of
men
assuredly
what
a
curse
is
gold
and
what
a
blessing
replied
krantz
i
am
sorry
pedro
is
left
with
them
it
is
their
destiny
replied
philip
so
let's
think
no
more
of
them
now
what
do
you
propose
with
this
vessel
small
as
she
is
we
may
sail
over
these
seas
in
safety
and
we
have
i
imagine
provisions
sufficient
for
more
than
a
month
my
idea
is
to
run
into
the
track
of
the
vessels
going
to
the
westward
and
obtain
a
passage
to
goa
and
if
we
do
not
meet
with
any
we
can
at
all
events
proceed
up
the
straits
as
far
as
pulo
penang
without
risk
there
we
may
safely
remain
until
a
vessel
passes
i
agree
with
you
it
is
our
best
nay
our
only
place
unless
indeed
we
were
to
proceed
to
cochin
where
junks
are
always
leaving
for
goa
but
that
would
be
out
of
our
way
and
the
junks
cannot
well
pass
us
in
the
straits
without
their
being
seen
by
us
they
had
no
difficulty
in
steering
their
course
the
islands
by
day
and
the
clear
stars
by
night
were
their
compass
it
is
true
that
they
did
not
follow
the
more
direct
track
but
they
followed
the
more
secure
working
up
the
smooth
waters
and
gaining
to
the
northward
more
than
to
the
west
many
times
they
were
chased
by
the
malay
proas
which
infested
the
islands
but
the
swiftness
of
their
little
peroqua
was
their
security
indeed
the
chase
was
generally
speaking
abandoned
as
soon
as
the
smallness
of
the
vessel
was
made
out
by
the
pirates
who
expected
that
little
or
no
booty
was
to
be
gained
that
amine
and
philip's
mission
was
the
constant
theme
of
their
discourse
may
easily
be
imagined
one
morning
as
they
were
sailing
between
the
isles
with
less
wind
than
usual
philip
observed
krantz
you
said
that
there
were
events
in
your
own
life
or
connected
with
it
which
would
corroborate
the
mysterious
tale
i
confided
to
you
will
you
now
tell
me
to
what
you
referred
certainly
replied
krantz
i've
often
thought
of
doing
so
but
one
circumstance
or
another
has
hitherto
prevented
me
this
is
however
a
fitting
opportunity
prepare
therefore
to
listen
to
a
strange
story
quite
as
strange
perhaps
as
your
own--
i
take
it
for
granted
that
you
have
heard
people
speak
of
the
hartz
mountains
observed
krantz
i
have
never
heard
people
speak
of
them
that
i
can
recollect
replied
philip
but
i
have
read
of
them
in
some
book
and
of
the
strange
things
which
have
occurred
there
it
is
indeed
a
wild
region
rejoined
krantz
and
many
strange
tales
are
told
of
it
but
strange
as
they
are
i
have
good
reason
for
believing
them
to
be
true
i
have
told
you
philip
that
i
fully
believe
in
your
communion
with
the
other
world--that
i
credit
the
history
of
your
father
and
the
lawfulness
of
your
mission
for
that
we
are
surrounded
impelled
and
worked
upon
by
beings
different
in
their
nature
from
ourselves
i
have
had
full
evidence
as
you
will
acknowledge
when
i
state
what
has
occurred
in
my
own
family
why
such
malevolent
beings
as
i
am
about
to
speak
of
should
be
permitted
to
interfere
with
us
and
punish
i
may
say
comparatively
unoffending
mortals
is
beyond
my
comprehension
but
that
they
are
so
permitted
is
most
certain
the
great
principle
of
all
evil
fulfils
his
work
of
evil
why
then
not
the
other
minor
spirits
of
the
same
class
inquired
philip
what
matters
it
to
us
whether
we
are
tried
by
and
have
to
suffer
from
the
enmity
of
our
fellow-mortals
or
whether
we
are
persecuted
by
beings
more
powerful
and
more
malevolent
than
ourselves
we
know
that
we
have
to
work
out
our
salvation
and
that
we
shall
be
judged
according
to
our
strength
if
then
there
be
evil
spirits
who
delight
to
oppress
man
there
surely
must
be
as
amine
asserts
good
spirits
whose
delight
is
to
do
him
service
whether
then
we
have
to
struggle
against
our
passions
only
or
whether
we
have
to
struggle
not
only
against
our
passions
but
also
the
dire
influence
of
unseen
enemies
we
ever
struggle
with
the
same
odds
in
our
favour
as
the
good
are
stronger
than
the
evil
which
we
combat
in
either
case
we
are
on
the
'vantage
ground
whether
as
in
the
first
we
fight
the
good
cause
single-handed
or
as
in
the
second
although
opposed
we
have
the
host
of
heaven
ranged
on
our
side
thus
are
the
scales
of
divine
justice
evenly
balanced
and
man
is
still
a
free
agent
as
his
own
virtuous
or
vicious
propensities
must
ever
decide
whether
he
shall
gain
or
lose
the
victory
most
true
replied
krantz
and
now
to
my
history--
my
father
was
not
born
or
originally
a
resident
in
the
hartz
mountains
he
was
the
serf
of
an
hungarian
nobleman
of
great
possessions
in
transylvania
but
although
a
serf
he
was
not
by
any
means
a
poor
or
illiterate
man
in
fact
he
was
rich
and
his
intelligence
and
respectability
were
such
that
he
had
been
raised
by
his
lord
to
the
stewardship
but
whoever
may
happen
to
be
born
a
serf
a
serf
must
he
remain
even
though
he
become
a
wealthy
man
and
such
was
the
condition
of
my
father
my
father
had
been
married
for
about
five
years
and
by
his
marriage
had
three
children--my
eldest
brother
caesar
myself
hermann
and
a
sister
named
marcella
you
know
philip
that
latin
is
still
the
language
spoken
in
that
country
and
that
will
account
for
our
high-sounding
names
my
mother
was
a
very
beautiful
woman
unfortunately
more
beautiful
than
virtuous
she
was
seen
and
admired
by
the
lord
of
the
soil
my
father
was
sent
away
upon
some
mission
and
during
his
absence
my
mother
flattered
by
the
attentions
and
won
by
the
assiduities
of
this
nobleman
yielded
to
his
wishes
it
so
happened
that
my
father
returned
very
unexpectedly
and
discovered
the
intrigue
the
evidence
of
my
mother's
shame
was
positive
he
surprised
her
in
the
company
of
her
seducer
carried
away
by
the
impetuosity
of
his
feelings
he
watched
the
opportunity
of
a
meeting
taking
place
between
them
and
murdered
both
his
wife
and
her
seducer
conscious
that
as
a
serf
not
even
the
provocation
which
he
had
received
would
be
allowed
as
a
justification
of
his
conduct
he
hastily
collected
together
what
money
he
could
lay
his
hands
upon
and
as
we
were
then
in
the
depth
of
winter
he
put
his
horses
to
the
sleigh
and
taking
his
children
with
him
he
set
off
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
was
far
away
before
the
tragical
circumstance
had
transpired
aware
that
he
would
be
pursued
and
that
he
had
no
chance
of
escape
if
he
remained
in
any
portion
of
his
native
country
in
which
the
authorities
could
lay
hold
of
him
he
continued
his
flight
without
intermission
until
he
had
buried
himself
in
the
intricacies
and
seclusion
of
the
hartz
mountains
of
course
all
that
i
have
now
told
you
i
learned
afterwards
my
oldest
recollections
are
knit
to
a
rude
yet
comfortable
cottage
in
which
i
lived
with
my
father
brother
and
sister
it
was
on
the
confines
of
one
of
those
vast
forests
which
cover
the
northern
part
of
germany
around
it
were
a
few
acres
of
ground
which
during
the
summer
months
my
father
cultivated
and
which
though
they
yielded
a
doubtful
harvest
were
sufficient
for
our
support
in
the
winter
we
remained
much
in
doors
for
as
my
father
followed
the
chase
we
were
left
alone
and
the
wolves
during
that
season
incessantly
prowled
about
my
father
had
purchased
the
cottage
and
land
about
it
of
one
of
the
rude
foresters
who
gain
their
livelihood
partly
by
hunting
and
partly
by
burning
charcoal
for
the
purpose
of
smelting
the
ore
from
the
neighbouring
mines
it
was
distant
about
two
miles
from
any
other
habitation
i
can
call
to
mind
the
whole
landscape
now
the
tall
pines
which
rose
up
on
the
mountain
above
us
and
the
wide
expanse
of
forest
beneath
on
the
topmost
boughs
and
heads
of
whose
trees
we
looked
down
from
our
cottage
as
the
mountain
below
us
rapidly
descended
into
the
distant
valley
in
summer-time
the
prospect
was
beautiful
but
during
the
severe
winter
a
more
desolate
scene
could
not
well
be
imagined
i
said
that
in
the
winter
my
father
occupied
himself
with
the
chase
every
day
he
left
us
and
often
would
he
lock
the
door
that
we
might
not
leave
the
cottage
he
had
no
one
to
assist
him
or
to
take
care
of
us--indeed
it
was
not
easy
to
find
a
female
servant
who
would
live
in
such
a
solitude
but
could
he
have
found
one
my
father
would
nut
have
received
her
for
he
had
imbibed
a
horror
of
the
sex
as
the
difference
of
his
conduct
towards
us
his
two
boys
and
my
poor
little
sister
marcella
evidently
proved
you
may
suppose
we
were
sadly
neglected
indeed
we
suffered
much
for
my
father
fearful
that
we
might
come
to
some
harm
would
not
allow
us
fuel
when
he
left
the
cottage
and
we
were
obliged
therefore
to
creep
under
the
heaps
of
bears'
skins
and
there
to
keep
ourselves
as
warm
as
we
could
until
he
returned
in
the
evening
when
a
blazing
fire
was
our
delight
that
my
father
chose
this
restless
sort
of
life
may
appear
strange
but
the
fact
was
that
he
could
not
remain
quiet
whether
from
the
remorse
for
having
committed
murder
or
from
the
misery
consequent
on
his
change
of
situation
or
from
both
combined
he
was
never
happy
unless
he
was
in
a
state
of
activity
children
however
when
left
much
to
themselves
acquire
a
thoughtfulness
not
common
to
their
age
so
it
was
with
us
and
during
the
short
cold
days
of
winter
we
would
sit
silent
longing
for
the
happy
hours
when
the
snow
would
melt
and
the
leaves
would
burst
out
and
the
birds
begin
their
songs
and
when
we
should
again
be
set
at
liberty
such
was
our
peculiar
and
savage
sort
of
life
until
my
brother
caesar
was
nine
myself
seven
and
my
sister
five
years
old
when
the
circumstances
occurred
on
which
is
based
the
extraordinary
narrative
which
i
am
about
to
relate
one
evening
my
father
returned
home
rather
later
than
usual
he
had
been
unsuccessful
and
as
the
weather
was
very
severe
and
many
feet
of
snow
were
upon
the
ground
he
was
not
only
very
cold
but
in
a
very
bad
humour
he
had
brought
in
wood
and
we
were
all
three
gladly
assisting
each
other
in
blowing
on
the
embers
to
create
the
blaze
when
he
caught
poor
little
marcella
by
the
arm
and
threw
her
aside
the
child
fell
struck
her
mouth
and
bled
very
much
my
brother
ran
to
raise
her
up
accustomed
to
ill-usage
and
afraid
of
my
father
she
did
not
dare
to
cry
but
looked
up
in
his
face
very
piteously
my
father
drew
his
stool
nearer
to
the
hearth
muttered
something
in
abuse
of
women
and
busied
himself
with
the
fire
which
both
my
brother
and
i
had
deserted
when
my
sister
was
so
unkindly
treated
a
cheerful
blaze
was
soon
the
result
of
his
exertions
but
we
did
not
as
usual
crowd
round
it
marcella
still
bleeding
retired
to
a
corner
and
my
brother
and
i
took
our
seats
beside
her
while
my
father
hung
over
the
fire
gloomily
and
alone
such
had
been
our
position
for
about
half
an
hour
when
the
howl
of
a
wolf
close
under
the
window
of
the
cottage
fell
on
our
ears
my
father
started
up
and
seized
his
gun
the
howl
was
repeated
he
examined
the
priming
and
then
hastily
left
the
cottage
shutting
the
door
after
him
we
all
waited
anxiously
listening
for
we
thought
that
if
he
succeeded
in
shooting
the
wolf
he
would
return
in
a
better
humour
and
although
he
was
harsh
to
all
of
us
and
particularly
so
to
our
little
sister
still
we
loved
our
father
and
loved
to
see
him
cheerful
and
happy
for
what
else
had
we
to
look
up
to
and
i
may
here
observe
that
perhaps
there
never
were
three
children
who
were
fonder
of
each
other
we
did
not
like
other
children
fight
and
dispute
together
and
if
by
chance
any
disagreement
did
arise
between
my
elder
brother
and
me
little
marcella
would
run
to
us
and
kissing
us
both
seal
through
her
entreaties
the
peace
between
us
marcella
was
a
lovely
amiable
child
i
can
recall
her
beautiful
features
even
now--alas
poor
little
marcella
she
is
dead
then
observed
philip
dead
yes
dead--but
how
did
she
die--but
i
must
not
anticipate
philip
let
me
tell
my
story
we
waited
or
some
time
but
the
report
of
the
gun
did
not
reach
us
and
my
elder
brother
then
said
our
father
has
followed
the
wolf
and
will
not
be
back
for
some
time
marcella
let
us
wash
the
blood
from
your
mouth
and
then
we
will
leave
this
corner
and
go
to
the
fire
and
warm
ourselves'
we
did
so
and
remained
there
until
near
midnight
every
minute
wondering
as
it
grew
later
why
our
father
did
not
return
we
had
no
idea
that
he
was
in
any
danger
but
we
thought
that
he
must
have
chased
the
wolf
for
a
very
long
time
i
will
look
out
and
see
if
father
is
coming'
said
my
brother
caesar
going
to
the
door
take
care'
said
marcella
the
wolves
must
be
about
now
and
we
cannot
kill
them
brother'
my
brother
opened
the
door
very
cautiously
and
but
a
few
inches
he
peeped
out--i
see
nothing'
said
he
after
a
time
and
once
more
he
joined
us
at
the
fire
we
have
had
no
supper'
said
i
for
my
father
usually
cooked
the
meat
as
soon
as
he
came
home
and
during
his
absence
we
had
nothing
but
the
fragments
of
the
preceding
day
and
if
our
father
comes
home
after
his
hunt
caesar'
said
marcella
he
will
be
pleased
to
have
some
supper
let
us
cook
it
for
him
and
for
ourselves'
caesar
climbed
upon
the
stool
and
reached
down
some
meat--
i
forget
now
whether
it
was
venison
or
bear's
meat
but
we
cut
off
the
usual
quantity
and
proceeded
to
dress
it
as
we
used
to
do
under
our
father's
superintendence
we
were
all
busy
putting
it
into
the
platters
before
the
fire
to
await
his
coming
when
we
heard
the
sound
of
a
horn
we
listened--there
was
a
noise
outside
and
a
minute
afterwards
my
father
entered
ushering
in
a
young
female
and
a
large
dark
man
in
a
hunter's
dress
perhaps
i
had
better
now
relate
what
was
only
known
to
me
many
years
afterwards
when
my
father
had
left
the
cottage
he
perceived
a
large
white
wolf
about
thirty
yards
from
him
as
soon
as
the
animal
saw
my
father
it
retreated
slowly
growling
and
snarling
my
father
followed
the
animal
did
not
run
but
always
kept
at
some
distance
and
my
father
did
not
like
to
fire
until
he
was
pretty
certain
that
his
ball
would
take
effect
thus
they
went
on
for
some
time
the
wolf
now
leaving
my
father
far
behind
and
then
stopping
and
snarling
defiance
at
him
and
then
again
on
his
approach
setting
off
at
speed
anxious
to
shoot
the
animal
for
the
white
wolf
is
very
rare
my
father
continued
the
pursuit
for
several
hours
during
which
he
continually
ascended
the
mountain
you
must
know
philip
that
there
are
peculiar
spots
on
those
mountains
which
are
supposed
and
as
my
story
will
prove
truly
supposed
to
be
inhabited
by
the
evil
influences
they
are
well
known
to
the
huntsmen
who
invariably
avoid
them
now
one
of
these
spots
an
open
space
in
the
pine
forests
above
us
had
been
pointed
out
to
my
father
as
dangerous
on
that
account
but
whether
he
disbelieved
these
wild
stories
or
whether
in
his
eager
pursuit
of
the
chase
he
disregarded
them
i
know
not
certain
however
it
is
that
he
was
decoyed
by
the
white
wolf
to
this
open
space
when
the
animal
appeared
to
slacken
her
speed
my
father
approached
came
close
up
to
her
raised
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
was
about
to
fire
when
the
wolf
suddenly
disappeared
he
thought
that
the
snow
on
the
ground
must
have
dazzled
his
sight
and
he
let
down
his
gun
to
look
for
the
beast--but
she
was
gone
how
she
could
have
escaped
over
the
clearance
without
his
seeing
her
was
beyond
his
comprehension
mortified
at
the
ill
success
of
his
chase
he
was
about
to
retrace
his
steps
when
he
heard
the
distant
sound
of
a
horn
astonishment
at
such
a
sound--at
such
an
hour--in
such
a
wilderness
made
him
forget
for
the
moment
his
disappointment
and
he
remained
riveted
to
the
spot
in
a
minute
the
horn
was
blown
a
second
time
and
at
no
great
distance
my
father
stood
still
and
listened
a
third
time
it
was
blown
i
forget
the
term
used
to
express
it
but
it
was
the
signal
which
my
father
well
knew
implied
that
the
party
was
lost
in
the
woods
in
a
few
minutes
more
my
father
beheld
a
man
on
horseback
with
a
female
seated
on
the
crupper
enter
the
cleared
space
and
ride
up
to
him
at
first
my
father
called
to
mind
the
strange
stories
which
he
had
heard
of
the
supernatural
beings
who
were
said
to
frequent
these
mountains
but
the
nearer
approach
of
the
parties
satisfied
him
that
they
were
mortals
like
himself
as
soon
as
they
came
up
to
him
the
man
who
guided
the
horse
accosted
him
friend
hunter
you
are
out
late
the
better
fortune
for
us
we
have
ridden
far
and
are
in
fear
of
our
lives
which
are
eagerly
sought
after
these
mountains
have
enabled
us
to
elude
our
pursuers
but
if
we
find
not
shelter
and
refreshment
that
will
avail
us
little
as
we
must
perish
from
hunger
and
the
inclemency
of
the
night
my
daughter
who
rides
behind
me
is
now
more
dead
than
alive--say
can
you
assist
us
in
our
difficulty'
my
cottage
is
some
few
miles
distant'
replied
my
father
but
i
have
little
to
offer
you
besides
a
shelter
from
the
weather
to
the
little
i
have
you
are
welcome
may
i
ask
whence
you
come'
yes
friend
it
is
no
secret
now
we
have
escaped
from
transylvania
where
my
daughter's
honour
and
my
life
were
equally
in
jeopardy'
this
information
was
quite
enough
to
raise
an
interest
in
my
father's
heart
he
remembered
his
own
escape
he
remembered
the
loss
of
his
wife's
honour
and
the
tragedy
by
which
it
was
wound
up
he
immediately
and
warmly
offered
all
the
assistance
which
he
could
afford
them
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
then
good
sir'
observed
the
horseman
my
daughter
is
chilled
with
the
frost
and
cannot
hold
out
much
longer
against
the
severity
of
the
weather'
follow
me'
replied
my
father
leading
the
way
towards
his
home
i
was
lured
away
in
pursuit
of
a
large
white
wolf'
observed
my
father
it
came
to
the
very
window
of
my
hut
or
i
should
not
have
been
out
at
this
time
of
night'
the
creature
passed
by
us
just
as
we
came
out
of
the
wood'
said
the
female
in
a
silvery
tone
i
was
nearly
discharging
my
piece
at
it'
observed
the
hunter
but
since
it
did
us
such
good
service
i
am
glad
i
allowed
it
to
escape'
in
about
an
hour
and
a
half
during
which
my
father
walked
at
a
rapid
pace
the
party
arrived
at
the
cottage
and
as
i
said
before
came
in
we
are
in
good
time
apparently'
observed
the
dark
hunter
catching
the
smell
of
the
roasted
meat
as
he
walked
to
the
fire
and
surveyed
my
brother
and
sister
and
myself
you
have
young
cooks
here
meinheer'
i
am
glad
that
we
shall
not
have
to
wait'
replied
my
father
come
mistress
seat
yourself
by
the
fire
you
require
warmth
after
your
cold
ride'
and
where
can
i
put
up
my
horse
meinheer'
observed
the
huntsman
i
will
take
care
of
him'
replied
my
father
going
out
of
the
cottage
door
the
female
must
however
be
particularly
described
she
was
young
and
apparently
twenty
years
of
age
she
was
dressed
in
a
travelling-dress
deeply
bordered
with
white
fur
and
wore
a
cap
of
white
ermine
on
her
head
her
features
were
very
beautiful
at
least
i
thought
so
and
so
my
father
has
since
declared
her
hair
was
flaxen
glossy
and
shining
and
bright
as
a
mirror
and
her
mouth
although
somewhat
large
when
it
was
open
showed
the
most
brilliant
teeth
i
have
ever
beheld
but
there
was
something
about
her
eyes
bright
as
they
were
which
made
us
children
afraid
they
were
so
restless
so
furtive
i
could
not
at
that
time
tell
why
but
i
felt
as
if
there
was
cruelty
in
her
eye
and
when
she
beckoned
us
to
come
to
her
we
approached
her
with
fear
and
trembling
still
she
was
beautiful
very
beautiful
she
spoke
kindly
to
my
brother
and
myself
patted
our
heads
and
caressed
us
but
marcella
would
not
come
near
her
on
the
contrary
she
slunk
away
and
hid
herself
in
the
bed
and
would
not
wait
for
the
supper
which
half
an
hour
before
she
had
been
so
anxious
for
my
father
having
put
the
horse
into
a
close
shed
soon
returned
and
supper
was
placed
upon
the
table
when
it
was
over
my
father
requested
that
the
young
lady
would
take
possession
of
his
bed
and
he
would
remain
at
the
fire
and
sit
up
with
her
father
after
some
hesitation
on
her
part
this
arrangement
was
agreed
to
and
i
and
my
brother
crept
into
the
other
bed
with
marcella
for
we
had
as
yet
always
slept
together
but
we
could
not
sleep
there
was
something
so
unusual
not
only
in
seeing
strange
people
but
in
having
those
people
sleep
at
the
cottage
that
we
were
bewildered
as
for
poor
little
marcella
she
was
quiet
but
i
perceived
that
she
trembled
during
the
whole
night
and
sometimes
i
thought
that
she
was
checking
a
sob
my
father
had
brought
out
some
spirits
which
he
rarely
used
and
he
and
the
strange
hunter
remained
drinking
and
talking
before
the
fire
our
ears
were
ready
to
catch
the
slightest
whisper--so
much
was
our
curiosity
excited
you
said
you
came
from
transylvania'
observed
my
father
even
so
meinheer'
replied
the
hunter
i
was
a
serf
to
the
noble
house
of
---
my
master
would
insist
upon
my
surrendering
up
my
fair
girl
to
his
wishes
it
ended
in
my
giving
him
a
few
inches
of
my
hunting-knife'
we
are
countrymen
and
brothers
in
misfortune'
replied
my
father
taking
the
huntsman's
hand
and
pressing
it
warmly
indeed
are
you
then
from
that
country'
yes
and
i
too
have
fled
for
my
life
but
mine
is
a
melancholy
tale'
your
name'
inquired
the
hunter
krantz'
what
krantz
of
---
i
have
heard
your
tale
you
need
not
renew
your
grief
by
repeating
it
now
welcome
most
welcome
meinheer
and
i
may
say
my
worthy
kinsman
i
am
your
second
cousin
wilfred
of
barnsdorf'
cried
the
hunter
rising
up
and
embracing
my
father
they
filled
their
horn-mugs
to
the
brim
and
drank
to
one
another
after
the
german
fashion
the
conversation
was
then
carried
on
in
a
low
tone
all
that
we
could
collect
from
it
was
that
our
new
relative
and
his
daughter
were
to
take
up
their
abode
in
our
cottage
at
least
for
the
present
in
about
an
hour
they
both
fell
back
in
their
chairs
and
appeared
to
sleep
marcella
dear
did
you
hear'
said
my
brother
in
a
low
tone
yes'
replied
marcella
in
a
whisper
i
heard
all
oh
brother
i
cannot
bear
to
look
upon
that
woman--i
feel
so
frightened'
my
brother
made
no
reply
and
shortly
afterwards
we
were
all
three
fast
asleep
when
we
awoke
the
next
morning
we
found
that
the
hunter's
daughter
had
risen
before
us
i
thought
she
looked
more
beautiful
than
ever
she
came
up
to
little
marcella
and
caressed
her
the
child
burst
into
tears
and
sobbed
as
if
her
heart
would
break
but
not
to
detain
you
with
too
long
a
story
the
huntsman
and
his
daughter
were
accommodated
in
the
cottage
my
father
and
he
went
out
hunting
daily
leaving
christina
with
us
she
performed
all
the
household
duties
was
very
kind
to
us
children
and
gradually
the
dislike
even
of
little
marcella
wore
away
but
a
great
change
took
place
in
my
father
he
appeared
to
have
conquered
his
aversion
to
the
sex
and
was
most
attentive
to
christina
often
after
her
father
and
we
were
in
bed
would
he
sit
up
with
her
conversing
in
a
low
tone
by
the
fire
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
that
my
father
and
the
huntsman
wilfred
slept
in
another
portion
of
the
cottage
and
that
the
bed
which
he
formerly
occupied
and
which
was
in
the
same
room
as
ours
had
been
given
up
to
the
use
of
christina
these
visitors
had
been
about
three
weeks
at
the
cottage
when
one
night
after
we
children
had
been
sent
to
bed
a
consultation
was
held
my
father
had
asked
christina
in
marriage
and
had
obtained
both
her
own
consent
and
that
of
wilfred
after
this
a
conversation
took
place
which
was
as
nearly
as
i
can
recollect
as
follows
you
may
take
my
child
meinheer
krantz
and
my
blessing
with
her
and
i
shall
then
leave
you
and
seek
some
other
habitation--it
matters
little
where'
why
not
remain
here
wilfred'
no
no
i
am
called
elsewhere
let
that
suffice
and
ask
no
more
questions
you
have
my
child'
i
thank
you
for
her
and
will
duly
value
her
but
there
is
one
difficulty'
i
know
what
you
would
say
there
is
no
priest
here
in
this
wild
country
true
neither
is
there
any
law
to
bind
still
must
some
ceremony
pass
between
you
to
satisfy
a
father
will
you
consent
to
marry
her
after
my
fashion
if
so
i
will
marry
you
directly'
i
will'
replied
my
father
then
take
her
by
the
hand
now
meinheer
swear'
i
swear'
repeated
my
father
by
all
the
spirits
of
the
hartz
mountains--'
nay
why
not
by
heaven'
interrupted
my
father
because
it
is
not
my
humour'
rejoined
wilfred
if
i
prefer
that
oath
less
binding
perhaps
than
another
surely
you
will
not
thwart
me'
well
be
it
so
then
have
your
humour
will
you
make
me
swear
by
that
in
which
i
do
not
believe'
yet
many
do
so
who
in
outward
appearance
are
christians'
rejoined
wilfred
say
will
you
be
married
or
shall
i
take
my
daughter
away
with
me'
proceed'
replied
my
father
impatiently
i
swear
by
all
the
spirits
of
the
hartz
mountains
by
all
their
power
for
good
or
for
evil
that
i
take
christina
for
my
wedded
wife
that
i
will
ever
protect
her
cherish
her
and
love
her
that
my
hand
shall
never
be
raised
against
her
to
harm
her'
my
father
repeated
the
words
after
wilfred
and
if
i
fail
in
this
my
vow
may
all
the
vengeance
of
the
spirits
fall
upon
me
and
upon
my
children
may
they
perish
by
the
vulture
by
the
wolf
or
other
beasts
of
the
forest
may
their
flesh
be
torn
from
their
limbs
and
their
bones
blanch
in
the
wilderness
all
this
i
swear'
my
father
hesitated
as
he
repeated
the
last
words
little
marcella
could
not
restrain
herself
and
as
my
father
repeated
the
last
sentence
she
burst
into
tears
this
sudden
interruption
appeared
to
discompose
the
party
particularly
my
father
he
spoke
harshly
to
the
child
who
controlled
her
sobs
burying
her
face
under
the
bed-clothes
such
was
the
second
marriage
of
my
father
the
next
morning
the
hunter
wilfred
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
my
father
resumed
his
bed
which
was
in
the
same
room
as
ours
and
things
went
on
much
as
before
the
marriage
except
that
our
new
mother-in-law
did
not
show
any
kindness
towards
us
indeed
during
my
father's
absence
she
would
often
beat
us
particularly
little
marcella
and
her
eyes
would
flash
fire
as
she
looked
eagerly
upon
the
fair
and
lovely
child
one
night
my
sister
awoke
me
and
my
brother
what
is
the
matter'
said
caesar
she
has
gone
out'
whispered
marcella
gone
out'
yes
gone
out
at
the
door
in
her
night-clothes'
replied
the
child
i
saw
her
get
out
of
bed
look
at
my
father
to
see
if
he
slept
and
then
she
went
out
at
the
door'
what
could
induce
her
to
leave
her
bed
and
all
undressed
to
go
out
in
such
bitter
wintry
weather
with
the
snow
deep
on
the
ground
was
to
us
incomprehensible
we
lay
awake
and
in
about
an
hour
we
heard
the
growl
of
a
wolf
close
under
the
window
there
is
a
wolf'
said
caesar
she
will
be
torn
to
pieces'
oh
no'
cried
marcella
in
a
few
minutes
afterwards
our
mother-in-law
appeared
she
was
in
her
night-dress
as
marcella
had
stated
she
let
down
the
latch
of
the
door
so
as
to
make
no
noise
went
to
a
pail
of
water
and
washed
her
face
and
hands
and
then
slipped
into
the
bed
where
my
father
lay
we
all
three
trembled--we
hardly
knew
why
but
we
resolved
to
watch
the
next
night
we
did
so
and
not
only
on
the
ensuing
night
but
on
many
others
and
always
at
about
the
same
hour
would
our
mother-in-law
rise
from
her
bed
and
leave
the
cottage
and
after
she
was
gone
we
invariably
heard
the
growl
of
a
wolf
under
our
window
and
always
saw
her
on
her
return
wash
herself
before
she
retired
to
bed
we
observed
also
that
she
seldom
sat
down
to
meals
and
that
when
she
did
she
appeared
to
eat
with
dislike
but
when
the
meat
was
taken
down
to
be
prepared
for
dinner
she
would
often
furtively
put
a
raw
piece
into
her
mouth
my
brother
caesar
was
a
courageous
boy
he
did
not
like
to
speak
to
my
father
until
he
knew
more
he
resolved
that
he
would
follow
her
out
and
ascertain
what
she
did
marcella
and
i
endeavoured
to
dissuade
him
from
this
project
but
he
would
not
be
controlled
and
the
very
next
night
he
lay
down
in
his
clothes
and
as
soon
as
our
mother-in-law
had
left
the
cottage
he
jumped
up
took
down
my
father's
gun
and
followed
her
you
may
imagine
in
what
a
state
of
suspense
marcella
and
i
remained
during
his
absence
after
a
few
minutes
we
heard
the
report
of
a
gun
it
did
not
awaken
my
father
and
we
lay
trembling
with
anxiety
in
a
minute
afterwards
we
saw
our
mother-in-law
enter
the
cottage--her
dress
was
bloody
i
put
my
hand
to
marcella's
mouth
to
prevent
her
crying
out
although
i
was
myself
in
great
alarm
our
mother-in-law
approached
my
father's
bed
looked
to
see
if
he
was
asleep
and
then
went
to
the
chimney
and
blew
up
the
embers
into
a
blaze
who
is
there'
said
my
father
waking
up
lie
still
dearest'
replied
my
mother-in-law
it
is
only
me
i
have
lighted
the
fire
to
warm
some
water
i
am
not
quite
well'
my
father
turned
round
and
was
soon
asleep
but
we
hatched
our
mother-in-law
she
changed
her
linen
and
threw
the
garments
she
had
worn
into
the
fire
and
we
then
perceived
that
her
right
leg
was
bleeding
profusely
as
if
from
a
gun-shot
wound
she
bandaged
it
up
and
then
dressing
herself
remained
before
the
fire
until
the
break
of
day
poor
little
marcella
her
heart
beat
quick
as
she
pressed
me
to
her
side--so
indeed
did
mine
where
was
our
brother
caesar
how
did
my
mother-in-law
receive
the
wound
unless
from
his
gun
at
last
my
father
rose
and
then
for
the
first
time
i
spoke
saying
father
where
is
my
brother
caesar'
your
brother'
exclaimed
he
why
where
can
he
be'
merciful
heaven
i
thought
as
lay
very
restless
last
night'
observed
our
mother-in-law
that
i
heard
somebody
open
the
latch
of
the
door
and
dear
me
husband
what
has
become
of
your
gun'
my
father
cast
his
eyes
up
above
the
chimney
and
perceived
that
his
gun
was
missing
for
a
moment
he
looked
perplexed
then
seizing
a
broad
axe
he
went
out
of
the
cottage
without
saying
another
word
he
did
not
remain
away
from
us
long
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
bearing
in
his
arms
the
mangled
body
of
my
poor
brother
he
laid
it
down
and
covered
up
his
face
my
mother-in-law
rose
up
and
looked
at
the
body
while
marcella
and
i
threw
ourselves
by
its
side
wailing
and
sobbing
bitterly
go
to
bed
again
children'
said
she
sharply
husband'
continued
she
your
boy
must
have
taken
the
gun
down
to
shoot
a
wolf
and
the
animal
has
been
too
powerful
for
him
poor
boy
he
has
paid
dearly
for
his
rashness'
my
father
made
no
reply
i
wished
to
speak--to
tell
all--but
marcella
who
perceived
my
intention
held
me
by
the
arm
and
looked
at
me
so
imploringly
that
i
desisted
my
father
therefore
was
left
in
his
error
but
marcella
and
i
although
we
could
not
comprehend
it
were
conscious
that
our
mother-in-law
was
in
some
way
connected
with
my
brother's
death
that
day
my
father
went
out
and
dug
a
grave
and
when
he
hid
the
body
in
the
earth
he
piled
up
stones
over
it
so
that
the
wolves
should
not
be
able
to
dig
it
up
the
shock
of
this
catastrophe
was
to
my
poor
father
very
severe
for
several
days
he
never
went
to
the
chase
although
at
times
he
would
utter
bitter
anathemas
and
vengeance
against
the
wolves
but
during
this
time
of
mourning
on
his
part
my
mother-in-law's
nocturnal
wanderings
continued
with
the
same
regularity
as
before
at
last
my
father
took
down
his
gun
to
repair
to
the
forest
but
he
soon
returned
and
appeared
much
annoyed
would
you
believe
it
christina
that
the
wolves--perdition
to
the
whole
race--have
actually
contrived
to
dig
up
the
body
of
my
poor
boy
and
now
there
is
nothing
left
of
him
but
his
bones'
indeed'
replied
my
mother-in-law
marcella
looked
at
me
and
i
saw
in
her
intelligent
eye
all
she
would
have
uttered
a
wolf
growls
under
our
window
every
night
father'
said
i
ay
indeed
why
did
you
not
tell
me
boy
wake
me
the
next
time
you
hear
it'
i
saw
my
mother-in-law
turn
away
her
eyes
flashed
fire
and
she
gnashed
her
teeth
my
father
went
out
again
and
covered
up
with
a
larger
pile
of
stones
the
little
remnants
of
my
poor
brother
which
the
wolves
had
spared
such
was
the
first
act
of
the
tragedy
the
spring
now
came
on
the
snow
disappeared
and
we
were
permitted
to
leave
the
cottage
but
never
would
i
quit
for
one
moment
my
dear
little
sister
to
whom
since
the
death
of
my
brother
i
was
more
ardently
attached
than
ever
indeed
i
was
afraid
to
leave
her
alone
with
my
mother-in-law
who
appeared
to
have
a
particular
pleasure
in
ill-treating
the
child
my
father
was
now
employed
upon
his
little
farm
and
i
was
able
to
render
him
some
assistance
marcella
used
to
sit
by
us
while
we
were
at
work
leaving
my
mother-in-law
alone
in
the
cottage
i
ought
to
observe
that
as
the
spring
advanced
so
did
my
mother-in-law
decrease
her
nocturnal
rambles
and
that
we
never
heard
the
growl
of
the
wolf
under
the
window
after
i
had
spoken
of
it
to
my
father
one
day
when
my
father
and
i
were
in
the
field
marcella
being
with
us
my
mother-in-law
came
out
saying
that
she
was
going
into
the
forest
to
collect
some
herbs
my
father
wanted
and
that
marcella
must
go
to
the
cottage
and
watch
the
dinner
marcella
went
and
my
mother-in-law
soon
disappeared
in
the
forest
taking
a
direction
quite
contrary
to
that
in
which
the
cottage
stood
and
leaving
my
father
and
i
as
it
were
between
her
and
marcella
about
an
hour
afterwards
we
were
startled
by
shrieks
from
the
cottage--
evidently
the
shrieks
of
little
marcella
marcella
has
burnt
herself
father'
said
i
throwing
down
my
spade
my
father
threw
down
his
and
we
both
hastened
to
the
cottage
before
we
could
gain
the
door
out
darted
a
large
white
wolf
which
fled
with
the
utmost
celerity
my
father
had
no
weapon
he
rushed
into
the
cottage
and
there
saw
poor
little
marcella
expiring
her
body
was
dreadfully
mangled
and
the
blood
pouring
from
it
had
formed
a
large
pool
on
the
cottage
floor
my
father's
first
intention
had
been
to
seize
his
gun
and
pursue
but
he
was
checked
by
this
horrid
spectacle
he
knelt
down
by
his
dying
child
and
burst
into
tears
marcella
could
just
look
kindly
on
us
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
her
eyes
were
closed
in
death
my
father
and
i
were
still
hanging
over
my
poor
sister's
body
when
my
mother-in-law
came
in
at
the
dreadful
sight
she
expressed
much
concern
but
she
did
not
appear
to
recoil
from
the
sight
of
blood
as
most
women
do
poor
child'
said
she
it
must
have
been
that
great
white
wolf
which
passed
me
just
now
and
frightened
me
so
she's
quite
dead
krantz'
i
know
it--i
know
it'
cried
my
father
in
agony
i
thought
my
father
would
never
recover
from
the
effects
of
this
second
tragedy
he
mourned
bitterly
over
the
body
of
his
sweet
child
and
for
several
days
would
not
consign
it
to
its
grave
although
frequently
requested
by
my
mother-in-law
to
do
so
at
last
he
yielded
and
dug
a
grave
for
her
close
by
that
of
my
poor
brother
and
took
every
precaution
that
the
wolves
should
not
violate
her
remains
i
was
now
really
miserable
as
i
lay
alone
in
the
bed
which
i
had
formerly
shared
with
my
brother
and
sister
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
my
mother-in-law
was
implicated
in
both
their
deaths
although
i
could
not
account
for
the
manner
but
i
no
longer
felt
afraid
of
her
my
little
heart
was
full
of
hatred
and
revenge
the
night
after
my
sister
had
been
buried
as
i
lay
awake
i
perceived
my
mother-in-law
get
up
and
go
out
of
the
cottage
i
waited
some
time
then
dressed
myself
and
looked
out
through
the
door
which
i
half
opened
the
moon
shone
bright
and
i
could
see
the
spot
where
my
brother
and
my
sister
had
been
buried
and
what
was
my
horror
when
i
perceived
my
mother-in-law
busily
removing
the
stones
from
marcella's
grave
she
was
in
her
white
night-dress
and
the
moon
shone
full
upon
her
she
was
digging
with
her
hands
and
throwing
away
the
stones
behind
her
with
all
the
ferocity
of
a
wild
beast
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
collect
my
senses
and
decide
what
i
should
do
at
last
i
perceived
that
she
had
arrived
at
the
body
and
raised
it
up
to
the
side
of
the
grave
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
i
ran
to
my
father
and
awoke
him
father
father'
cried
i
dress
yourself
and
get
your
gun'
what'
cried
my
father
the
wolves
are
there
are
they'
he
jumped
out
of
bed
threw
on
his
clothes
and
in
his
anxiety
did
not
appear
to
perceive
the
absence
of
his
wife
as
soon
as
he
was
ready
i
opened
the
door
he
went
out
and
i
followed
him
imagine
his
horror
when
unprepared
as
he
was
for
such
a
sight
he
beheld
as
he
advanced
towards
the
grave
not
a
wolf
but
his
wife
in
her
night-dress
on
her
hands
and
knees
crouching
by
the
body
of
my
sister
and
tearing
off
large
pieces
of
the
flesh
and
devouring
them
with
all
the
avidity
of
a
wolf
she
was
too
busy
to
be
aware
of
our
approach
my
father
dropped
his
gun
his
hair
stood
on
end
so
did
mine
he
breathed
heavily
and
then
his
breath
for
a
time
stopped
i
picked
up
the
gun
and
put
it
into
his
hand
suddenly
he
appeared
as
if
concentrated
rage
had
restored
him
to
double
vigour
he
levelled
his
piece
fired
and
with
a
loud
shriek
down
fell
the
wretch
whom
he
had
fostered
in
his
bosom
god
of
heaven'
cried
my
father
sinking
down
upon
the
earth
in
a
swoon
as
soon
as
he
had
discharged
his
gun
i
remained
some
time
by
his
side
before
he
recovered
where
am
i'
said
he
what
has
happened
oh--yes
yes
i
recollect
now
heaven
forgive
me'
he
rose
and
we
walked
up
to
the
grave
what
again
was
our
astonishment
and
horror
to
find
that
instead
of
the
dead
body
of
my
mother-in-law
as
we
expected
there
was
lying
over
the
remains
of
my
poor
sister
a
large
white
she-wolf
the
white
wolf'
exclaimed
my
father
the
white
wolf
which
decoyed
me
into
the
forest--i
see
it
all
now--i
have
dealt
with
the
spirits
of
the
hartz
mountains'
for
some
time
my
father
remained
in
silence
and
deep
thought
he
then
carefully
lifted
up
the
body
of
my
sister
replaced
it
in
the
grave
an
covered
it
over
as
before
having
struck
the
head
of
the
dead
animal
with
the
heel
of
his
boot
and
raving
like
a
madman
he
walked
back
to
the
cottage
shut
the
door
and
threw
himself
on
the
bed
i
did
the
same
for
i
was
in
a
stupor
of
amazement
early
in
the
morning
we
were
both
roused
by
a
loud
knocking
at
the
door
and
in
rushed
the
hunter
wilfred
my
daughter--man--my
daughter--where
is
my
daughter'
cried
he
in
a
rage
where
the
wretch
the
fiend
should
be
i
trust'
replied
my
father
starting
up
and
displaying
equal
choler
where
she
should
be--in
hell
leave
this
cottage
or
you
may
fare
worse'
ha--ha'
replied
the
hunter
would
you
harm
a
potent
spirit
of
the
hartz
mountains
poor
mortal
who
must
needs
wed
a
were
wolf'
out
demon
i
defy
thee
and
thy
power'
yet
shall
you
feel
it
remember
your
oath--your
solemn
oath--never
to
raise
your
hand
against
her
to
harm
her'
i
made
no
compact
with
evil
spirits'
you
did
and
if
you
failed
in
your
vow
you
were
to
meet
the
vengeance
of
the
spirits
your
children
were
to
perish
by
the
vulture
the
wolf--'
out
out
demon'
and
their
bones
blanch
in
the
wilderness
ha--ha'
my
father
frantic
with
rage
seized
his
axe
and
raised
it
over
wilfred's
head
to
strike
all
this
i
swear'
continued
the
huntsman
mockingly
the
axe
descended
but
it
passed
through
the
form
of
the
hunter
and
my
father
lost
his
balance
and
tell
heavily
on
the
floor
mortal'
said
the
hunter
striding
over
my
father's
body
we
have
power
over
those
only
who
have
committed
murder
you
have
been
guilty
of
a
double
murder
you
shall
pay
the
penalty
attached
to
your
marriage
vow
two
of
your
children
are
gone
the
third
is
yet
to
follow--and
follow
them
he
will
for
your
oath
is
registered
go--it
were
kindness
to
kill
thee--your
punishment
is
that
you
live'
with
these
words
the
spirit
disappeared
my
father
rose
from
the
floor
embraced
me
tenderly
and
knelt
down
in
prayer
the
next
morning
he
quitted
the
cottage
for
ever
he
took
me
with
him
and
bent
his
steps
to
holland
where
we
safely
arrived
he
had
some
little
money
with
him
but
he
had
not
been
many
days
in
amsterdam
before
he
was
seized
with
a
brain
fever
and
died
raving
mad
i
was
put
into
the
asylum
and
afterwards
was
sent
to
sea
before
the
mast
you
now
know
all
my
history
the
question
is
whether
i
am
to
pay
the
penalty
of
my
father's
oath
i
am
myself
perfectly
convinced
that
in
some
way
or
another
i
shall
on
the
twenty-second
day
the
high
land
of
the
south
of
sumatra
was
in
view
as
there
were
no
vessels
in
sight
they
resolved
to
keep
their
course
through
the
straits
and
run
for
pulo
penang
which
they
expected
as
their
vessel
lay
so
close
to
the
wind
to
reach
in
seven
or
eight
days
by
constant
exposure
philip
and
krantz
were
now
so
bronzed
that
with
their
long
beards
and
mussulman
dresses
they
might
easily
have
passed
off
for
natives
they
had
steered
the
whole
of
the
days
exposed
to
a
burning
sun
they
had
lain
down
and
slept
in
the
dew
of
the
night
but
their
health
had
not
suffered
but
for
several
days
since
he
had
confided
the
history
of
his
family
to
philip
krantz
had
become
silent
and
melancholy
his
usual
flow
of
spirits
had
vanished
and
philip
had
often
questioned
him
as
to
the
cause
as
they
entered
the
straits
philip
talked
of
what
they
should
do
upon
their
arrival
at
goa
when
krantz
gravely
replied
for
some
days
philip
i
have
had
a
presentiment
that
i
shall
never
see
that
city
you
are
out
of
health
krantz
replied
philip
no
i
am
in
sound
health
body
and
mind
i
have
endeavoured
to
shake
off
the
presentiment
but
in
vain
there
is
a
warning
voice
that
continually
tells
me
that
i
shall
not
be
long
with
you
philip
will
you
oblige
me
by
making
me
content
on
one
point
i
have
gold
about
my
person
which
may
be
useful
to
you
oblige
me
by
taking
it
and
securing
it
on
your
own
what
nonsense
krantz
it
is
no
nonsense
philip
have
on
not
had
your
warnings
why
should
i
not
have
mine
you
know
that
i
have
little
fear
in
my
composition
and
that
i
care
not
about
death
but
i
feel
the
presentiment
which
i
speak
of
more
strongly
every
hour
it
is
some
kind
spirit
who
would
warn
me
to
prepare
for
another
world
be
it
so
i
have
lived
long
enough
in
this
world
to
leave
it
without
regret
although
to
part
with
you
and
amine
the
only
two
now
dear
to
me
is
painful
i
acknowledge
may
not
this
arise
from
over-exertion
and
fatigue
krantz
consider
how
much
excitement
you
have
laboured
under
within
these
last
four
months
is
not
that
enough
to
create
a
corresponding
depression
depend
upon
it
my
dear
friend
such
is
the
fact
i
wish
it
were
but
i
feel
otherwise
and
there
is
a
feeling
of
gladness
connected
with
the
idea
that
i
am
to
leave
this
world
arising
from
another
presentiment
which
equally
occupies
my
mind
i
hardly
can
tell
you--but
amine
and
you
are
connected
with
it
in
my
dreams
i
have
seen
you
meet
again
but
it
has
appeared
to
me
as
if
a
portion
of
your
trial
was
purposely
shut
from
my
sight
in
dark
clouds
and
i
have
asked
may
not
i
see
what
is
there
concealed'--and
an
invisible
has
answered
no
'twould
make
you
wretched
before
these
trials
take
place
you
will
be
summoned
away'
and
then
i
have
thanked
heaven
and
felt
resigned
these
are
the
imaginings
of
a
disturbed
brain
krantz
that
i
am
destined
to
suffering
may
be
true
but
why
amine
should
suffer
or
why
you
young
in
full
health
and
vigour
should
not
pass
your
days
in
peace
and
live
to
a
good
old
age
there
is
no
cause
for
believing
you
will
be
better
tomorrow
perhaps
so
replied
krantz
but
still
you
must
yield
to
my
whim
and
take
the
gold
if
i
am
wrong
and
we
do
arrive
safe
you
know
philip
you
can
let
me
have
it
back
observed
krantz
with
a
faint
smile--but
you
forget
our
water
is
nearly
out
and
we
must
look
out
for
a
rill
on
the
coast
to
obtain
a
fresh
supply
i
was
thinking
of
that
when
you
commenced
this
unwelcome
topic
we
had
better
look
out
for
the
water
before
dark
and
as
soon
as
we
have
replenished
our
jars
we
will
make
sail
again
at
the
time
that
this
conversation
took
place
they
were
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
strait
about
forty
miles
to
the
northward
the
interior
of
the
coast
was
rocky
and
mountainous
but
it
slowly
descended
to
low
land
of
alternate
forest
and
jungles
which
continued
to
the
beach
the
country
appeared
to
be
uninhabited
keeping
close
in
to
the
shore
they
discovered
after
two
hours'
run
a
fresh
stream
which
burst
in
a
cascade
from
the
mountains
and
swept
its
devious
course
through
the
jungle
until
it
poured
its
tribute
into
the
waters
of
the
strait
they
ran
close
in
to
the
mouth
of
the
stream
lowered
the
sails
and
pulled
the
peroqua
against
the
current
until
they
had
advanced
far
enough
to
assure
them
that
the
water
was
quite
fresh
the
jars
were
soon
filled
and
they
were
again
thinking
of
pushing
off
when
enticed
by
the
beauty
of
the
spot
the
coolness
of
the
fresh
water
and
wearied
with
their
long
confinement
on
board
of
the
peroqua
they
proposed
to
bathe--a
luxury
hardly
to
be
appreciated
by
those
who
have
not
been
in
a
similar
situation
they
threw
off
their
mussulman
dresses
and
plunged
into
the
stream
where
they
remained
for
some
time
krantz
was
the
first
to
get
out
he
complained
of
feeling
chilled
and
he
walked
on
to
the
banks
where
their
clothes
had
been
laid
philip
also
approached
nearer
to
the
beach
intending
to
follow
him
and
now
philip
said
krantz
this
will
be
a
good
opportunity
for
me
to
give
you
the
money
i
will
open
my
sash
and
pour
it
out
and
you
can
put
it
into
your
own
before
you
put
it
on
philip
was
standing
in
the
water
which
was
about
level
with
his
waist
well
krantz
said
he
i
suppose
if
it
must
be
so
it
must--but
it
appears
to
me
an
idea
so
ridiculous--however
you
shall
have
your
own
way
philip
quitted
the
run
and
sat
down
by
krantz
who
was
already
busy
in
shaking
the
doubloons
out
of
the
folds
of
his
sash
at
last
he
said--
i
believe
philip
you
have
got
them
all
now--i
feel
satisfied
what
danger
there
can
be
to
you
which
i
am
not
equally
exposed
to
i
cannot
conceive
replied
philip
however--
hardly
had
he
said
these
words
when
there
was
a
tremendous
roar--a
rush
like
a
mighty
wind
through
the
air--a
blow
which
threw
him
on
his
back--
a
loud
cry--and
a
contention
philip
recovered
himself
and
perceived
the
naked
form
of
krantz
carried
off
with
the
speed
of
an
arrow
by
an
enormous
tiger
through
the
jungle
he
watched
with
distended
eyeballs
in
a
few
seconds
the
animal
and
krantz
had
disappeared
god
of
heaven
would
that
thou
hadst
spared
me
this
cried
philip
throwing
himself
down
in
agony
on
his
face
oh
krantz
my
friend--my
brother--too
sure
was
your
presentiment
merciful
god
have
pity--but
thy
will
be
done
and
philip
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
for
more
than
an
hour
did
he
remain
fixed
upon
the
spot
careless
and
indifferent
to
the
danger
by
which
he
was
surrounded
at
last
somewhat
recovered
he
rose
dressed
himself
and
then
again
sat
down--his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
clothes
of
krantz
and
the
gold
which
a
on
the
sand
he
would
give
me
that
gold
he
foretold
his
doom
yes
yes
it
was
his
destiny
and
it
has
been
fulfilled
his
bones
will
bleach
in
the
wilderness
and
the
spirit-hunter
and
his
wolfish
daughter
are
avenged
the
shades
of
evening
now
set
in
and
the
low
growling
of
the
beasts
of
the
forest
recalled
philip
to
a
sense
of
his
own
danger
he
thought
of
amine
and
hastily
making
the
clothes
of
krantz
and
the
doubloons
into
a
package
he
stepped
into
the
peroqua
with
difficulty
shoved
it
off
and
with
a
melancholy
heart
and
in
silence
hoisted
the
sail
and
pursued
his
course
yes
amine
thought
philip
as
he
watched
the
stars
twinkling
and
coruscating
yes
you
are
right
when
you
assert
that
the
destinies
of
men
are
foreknown
and
may
by
some
be
read
my
destiny
is
alas
that
i
should
be
severed
from
all
i
value
upon
earth
and
die
friendless
and
alone
then
welcome
death
if
such
is
to
be
the
case
welcome--a
thousand
welcomes
what
a
relief
wilt
thou
be
to
me
what
joy
to
find
myself
summoned
to
where
the
weary
are
at
rest
i
have
my
task
to
fulfil
god
grant
that
it
may
soon
be
accomplished
and
let
not
my
life
be
embittered
by
any
more
trials
such
as
this
again
did
philip
weep
for
krantz
had
been
his
long-tried
valued
friend
his
partner
in
all
his
dangers
and
privations
from
the
period
that
they
had
met
when
the
dutch
fleet
attempted
the
passage
round
cape
horn
after
seven
days
of
painful
watching
and
brooding
over
bitter
thoughts
philip
arrived
at
pulo
penang
where
he
found
a
vessel
about
to
sail
for
the
city
to
which
he
was
destined
he
ran
his
peroqua
alongside
of
her
and
found
that
she
was
a
brig
under
the
portuguese
flag
having
however
but
two
portuguese
on
board
the
rest
of
the
crew
being
natives
representing
himself
as
am
englishman
in
the
portuguese
service
who
had
been
wrecked
and
offering
to
pay
for
his
passage
he
was
willingly
received
and
in
a
few
days
the
vessel
sailed
their
voyage
was
prosperous
in
six
weeks
they
anchored
in
the
roads
of
goa
the
next
day
they
went
up
the
river
the
portuguese
captain
informed
philip
where
he
might
obtain
lodging
and
passing
him
off
as
one
of
his
crew
there
was
no
difficulty
raised
as
to
his
landing
having
located
himself
at
his
new
lodging
philip
commenced
some
inquiries
of
his
host
relative
to
amine
designating
her
merely
as
a
young
woman
who
had
arrived
there
in
a
vessel
some
weeks
before
but
he
could
obtain
no
information
concerning
her
signor
said
the
host
to-morrow
is
the
grand
auto-da-fe
we
can
do
nothing
until
that
is
over
afterwards
i
will
put
you
in
the
way
to
find
out
what
you
wish
in
the
mean
time
you
can
walk
about
the
town
to-morrow
i
will
take
you
to
where
you
can
behold
the
grand
procession
and
then
we
will
try
what
we
can
do
to
assist
you
in
your
search
philip
went
out
procured
a
suit
of
clothes
removed
his
beard
and
then
walked
about
the
town
looking
up
at
every
window
to
see
if
he
could
perceive
amine
at
a
corner
of
one
of
the
streets
he
thought
he
recognised
father
mathias
and
ran
up
to
him
but
the
monk
had
drawn
his
cowl
over
his
head
and
when
addressed
by
that
name
made
no
reply
i
was
deceived
thought
philip
but
i
really
thought
it
was
him
and
philip
was
right
it
was
father
mathias
who
thus
screened
himself
from
philip's
recognition
tired
at
last
he
returned
to
his
hotel
just
before
it
was
dark
the
company
there
were
numerous
everybody
for
miles
distant
had
come
to
goa
to
witness
the
auto-da-fe--and
everybody
was
discussing
the
ceremony
i
will
see
this
grand
procession
said
philip
to
himself
as
he
threw
himself
on
his
bed
it
will
drive
thought
from
me
for
a
time
and
god
knows
how
painful
my
thoughts
have
now
become
amine
dear
amine
may
angels
guard
thee
although
to-morrow
was
to
end
all
amine's
hopes
and
fears--all
her
short
happiness--her
suspense
and
misery--yet
amine
slept
until
her
last
slumber
in
this
world
was
disturbed
by
the
unlocking
and
unbarring
of
the
doors
of
her
cell
and
the
appearance
of
the
head
gaoler
with
a
light
amine
started
up--she
had
been
dreaming
of
her
husband--of
happiness
she
awoke
to
the
sad
reality
there
stood
the
gaoler
with
a
dress
in
his
hand
which
he
desired
she
would
put
on
he
lighted
a
lamp
for
her
and
left
her
alone
the
dress
was
of
black
serge
with
white
stripes
amine
put
on
the
dress
and
threw
herself
down
on
the
bed
trying
if
possible
to
recall
the
dream
from
which
she
had
been
awakened
but
in
vain
two
hours
passed
away
and
the
gaoler
again
entered
and
summoned
her
to
follow
him
perhaps
one
of
the
most
appalling
customs
of
the
inquisition
is
that
after
accusation
whether
the
accused
parties
confess
their
guilt
or
not
they
return
to
their
dungeons
without
the
least
idea
of
what
may
have
been
their
sentence
and
when
summoned
on
the
morning
of
the
execution
they
are
equally
kept
in
ignorance
the
prisoners
were
all
summoned
by
the
gaolers
from
the
various
dungeons
and
led
into
a
large
hall
where
they
found
their
fellow-sufferers
collected
in
this
spacious
dimly-lighted
hall
were
to
be
seen
about
two
hundred
men
standing
up
as
if
for
support
against
the
walls
all
dressed
in
the
same
black
and
white
serge
so
motionless
so
terrified
were
they
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
rolling
of
their
eyes
as
they
watched
the
gaolers
who
passed
and
repassed
you
might
have
imagined
them
to
be
petrified
it
was
the
agony
of
suspense
worse
than
the
agony
of
death
after
a
time
a
wax
candle
about
five
feet
long
was
put
into
the
hands
of
each
prisoner
and
then
some
were
ordered
to
put
on
over
their
dress
the
sanbenitos--others
the
samarias
those
who
received
these
dresses
with
flames
painted
on
them
gave
themselves
up
for
lost
and
it
was
dreadful
to
perceive
the
anguish
of
each
individual
as
the
dresses
were
one
by
one
brought
forward
and
with
the
heavy
drops
of
perspiration
on
his
brows
he
watched
with
terror
lest
one
should
be
presented
to
him
all
was
doubt
fear
and
horror
but
the
prisoners
in
this
hall
were
not
those
who
were
to
suffer
death
those
who
wore
the
sanbenitos
had
to
walk
in
the
procession
and
receive
but
slight
punishment
those
who
wore
the
samarias
had
been
condemned
but
had
been
saved
from
the
consuming
fire
by
an
acknowledgment
of
their
offence
the
flames
painted
on
their
dresses
were
reversed
and
signified
that
they
were
not
to
suffer
but
this
the
unfortunate
wretches
did
not
know
and
the
horrors
of
a
cruel
death
stared
them
in
the
face
another
hall
similar
to
the
one
in
which
the
men
had
been
collected
was
occupied
by
female
culprits
the
same
ceremonies
were
observed--the
same
doubt
fear
and
agony
were
depicted
upon
every
countenance
but
there
was
a
third
chamber
smaller
than
the
other
two
and
this
chamber
was
reserved
for
those
who
had
been
sentenced
and
who
were
to
suffer
at
the
stake
it
was
into
this
chamber
that
amine
was
led
and
there
she
found
seven
other
prisoners
dressed
in
the
same
manner
as
herself
two
only
were
europeans
the
other
five
were
negro
slaves
each
of
these
had
his
confessor
with
him
and
was
earnestly
listening
to
his
exhortation
a
monk
approached
amine
but
she
waved
him
away
with
her
hand
he
looked
at
her
spat
on
the
floor
and
cursed
her
the
head
gaoler
now
made
his
appearance
with
the
dresses
for
those
who
were
in
this
chamber
these
were
samarias
only
different
from
the
others
inasmuch
as
the
flames
were
painted
on
them
upwards
instead
of
down
these
dresses
were
of
grey
stuff
and
loose
like
a
waggoner's
frock
at
the
lower
part
of
them
both
before
and
behind
was
painted
the
likeness
of
the
wearer
that
is
the
face
only
resting
upon
a
burning
fagot
and
surrounded
with
flames
and
demons
under
the
portrait
was
written
the
crime
for
which
the
party
suffered
sugar-loaf
caps
with
flames
painted
on
them
were
also
brought
and
put
on
their
heads
and
the
long
wax
candles
were
placed
into
their
hands
amine
and
the
others
condemned
being
arrayed
in
these
dresses
remained
in
the
chambers
for
some
hours
before
it
was
time
for
the
procession
to
commence
for
they
had
been
all
summoned
up
by
the
gaolers
at
about
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
the
sun
rose
brilliantly
much
to
the
joy
of
the
members
of
the
holy
office
who
would
not
have
had
the
day
obscured
on
which
they
were
to
vindicate
the
honour
of
the
church
and
to
prove
how
well
they
acted
up
to
the
mild
doctrines
of
the
saviour--those
of
charity
good-will
forbearing
one
another
forgiving
one
another
god
of
heaven
and
not
only
did
those
of
the
holy
inquisition
rejoice
but
thousands
and
thousands
more
who
had
flocked
from
all
parts
to
witness
the
dreadful
ceremony
and
to
hold
a
jubilee--many
indeed
actuated
by
fanatical
superstition
but
more
attended
from
thoughtlessness
and
the
love
of
pageantry
the
streets
and
squares
through
which
the
procession
was
to
pass
were
filled
at
an
early
hour
silks
tapestries
and
cloth
of
gold
and
silver
were
hung
over
the
balconies
and
out
of
the
windows
in
honour
of
the
procession
every
balcony
and
window
was
thronged
with
ladies
and
cavaliers
in
their
gayest
attire
all
waiting
anxiously
to
see
the
wretches
paraded
before
they
suffered
but
the
world
is
fond
of
excitement
and
where
is
anything
so
exciting
to
a
superstitious
people
as
an
auto-da-fe
as
the
sun
rose
the
heavy
bell
of
the
cathedral
tolled
and
all
the
prisoners
were
led
down
to
the
grand
hall
that
the
order
of
the
procession
might
be
arranged
at
the
large
entrance-door
on
a
raised
one
sat
the
grand
inquisitor
encircled
by
many
of
the
most
considerable
nobility
and
gentry
of
goa
by
the
grand
inquisitor
stood
his
secretary
and
as
the
prisoners
walked
past
the
throne
and
their
names
were
mentioned
the
secretary
after
each
called
out
the
names
of
one
of
those
gentlemen
who
immediately
stepped
forward
and
took
his
station
by
the
prisoner
these
people
are
termed
god-fathers
their
duty
is
to
accompany
and
be
answerable
for
the
prisoner
who
is
under
their
charge
until
the
ceremony
is
over
it
is
reckoned
a
high
honour
conferred
on
those
whom
the
grand
inquisitor
appoints
to
this
office
at
last
the
procession
commenced
first
was
raised
on
high
the
standard
of
the
dominican
order
of
monks
for
the
dominican
order
were
the
founders
of
the
inquisition
and
claimed
this
privilege
by
prescriptive
right
after
the
banner
the
monks
themselves
followed
in
two
lines
and
what
was
the
motto
of
their
banner--justitia
et
misericordia
then
followed
the
culprits
to
the
number
of
three
hundred
each
with
his
godfather
by
his
side
and
his
large
wax
candle
lighted
in
his
hand
those
whose
offences
have
been
most
venial
walk
first
all
are
bareheaded
and
barefooted
after
this
portion
who
wore
only
the
dress
of
black
and
white
serge
came
those
who
carried
the
sanbenitos
then
those
who
wore
the
samarias
with
the
flames
reversed
here
there
was
a
separation
in
the
procession
caused
by
a
large
cross
with
the
carved
image
of
our
saviour
nailed
to
it
the
face
of
the
image
carried
forward
this
was
intended
to
signify
that
those
in
advance
of
the
crucifix
and
upon
whom
the
saviour
looked
down
were
not
to
suffer
and
that
those
who
were
behind
and
upon
whom
his
back
was
turned
were
cast
away
to
perish
for
ever
in
this
world
and
the
next
behind
the
crucifix
followed
the
seven
condemned
and
as
the
greatest
criminal
amine
walked
the
last
but
the
procession
did
not
close
here
behind
amine
were
five
effigies
raised
high
on
poles
clothed
in
the
same
dresses
painted
with
flames
and
demons
behind
each
effigy
was
borne
a
coffin
containing
a
skeleton
the
effigies
were
of
those
who
had
died
in
their
dungeon
or
expired
under
the
torture
and
who
had
been
tried
and
condemned
after
their
death
and
sentenced
to
be
burnt
these
skeletons
had
been
dug
up
and
were
to
suffer
the
same
sentence
as
had
they
still
been
living
beings
they
would
have
undergone
the
effigies
were
to
be
tied
to
the
stakes
and
the
bones
were
to
be
consumed
then
followed
the
members
of
the
inquisition
the
familiars
monks
priests
and
hundreds
of
penitents
in
black
dresses
which
concealed
their
faces
all
with
the
lighted
tapers
in
their
hands
it
was
two
hours
before
the
procession
which
had
paraded
through
almost
every
important
street
in
goa
arrived
at
the
cathedral
in
which
the
further
ceremonies
were
to
be
gone
through
the
barefooted
culprits
could
now
scarcely
walk
the
small
sharp
flints
having
so
wounded
their
feet
that
their
tracks
up
the
steps
of
the
cathedral
were
marked
with
blood
the
grand
altar
of
the
cathedral
was
hung
with
black
cloth
and
lighted
up
with
thousands
of
tapers
on
one
side
of
it
was
a
throne
for
the
grand
inquisitor
on
the
other
a
raised
platform
for
the
viceroy
of
goa
and
his
suite
the
centre
aisle
had
benches
for
the
prisoners
and
their
godfathers
the
other
portions
of
the
procession
falling
off
to
the
right
and
left
to
the
side
aisles
and
mixing
for
the
time
with
the
spectators
as
the
prisoners
entered
the
cathedral
they
were
led
into
their
seats
those
least
guilty
sitting
nearest
to
the
altar
and
those
who
were
condemned
to
suffer
at
the
stake
being
placed
the
farthest
from
it
the
bleeding
amine
tottered
to
her
seat
and
longed
for
the
hour
which
was
to
sever
her
from
a
christian
world
she
thought
not
of
herself
nor
of
what
she
was
to
suffer
she
thought
but
of
philip
of
his
being
safe
from
these
merciless
creatures--of
the
happiness
of
dying
first
and
of
meeting
him
again
in
bliss
worn
with
long
confinement
with
suspense
and
anxiety
fatigued
and
suffering
from
her
painful
walk
and
the
exposure
to
the
burning
sun
after
so
many
months'
incarceration
in
a
dungeon
she
no
longer
shone
radiant
with
beauty
but
still
there
was
something
even
more
touching
in
her
care-worn
yet
still
perfect
features
the
object
of
universal
gaze
she
walked
with
her
eyes
cast
down
and
nearly
closed
but
occasionally
when
she
did
look
up
the
fire
that
flashed
from
them
spoke
the
proud
soul
within
and
many
feared
and
wondered
while
more
pitied
that
one
so
young
and
still
so
lovely
should
be
doomed
to
such
an
awful
fate
amine
had
not
taken
her
seat
in
the
cathedral
more
than
a
few
seconds
when
overpowered
by
her
feelings
and
by
fatigue
she
fell
back
in
a
swoon
did
no
one
step
forward
to
assist
her
to
raise
her
up
and
offer
her
restoratives
no--not
one
hundreds
would
have
done
so
but
they
dared
not
she
was
an
outcast
excommunicated
abandoned
and
lost
and
should
any
one
moved
by
compassion
for
a
suffering
fellow-creature
have
ventured
to
raise
her
up
he
would
have
been
looked
upon
with
suspicion
and
most
probably
have
been
arraigned
and
have
had
to
settle
the
affair
of
conscience
with
the
holy
inquisition
after
a
short
time
two
of
the
officers
of
the
inquisition
went
to
amine
and
raised
her
again
in
her
seat
and
she
recovered
sufficiently
to
enable
her
to
retain
her
posture
a
sermon
was
then
preached
by
a
dominican
monk
in
which
he
portrayed
the
tender
mercies
the
paternal
love
of
the
holy
office
he
compared
the
inquisition
to
the
ark
of
noah
out
of
which
all
the
animals
walked
after
the
deluge
but
with
this
difference
highly
in
favour
of
the
holy
office
that
the
animals
went
forth
from
the
ark
no
better
than
they
went
in
whereas
those
who
had
gone
into
the
inquisition
with
all
the
cruelty
of
disposition
and
with
the
hearts
of
wolves
came
out
as
mild
and
patient
as
lambs
the
public
accuser
then
mounted
the
pulpit
and
read
from
it
all
the
crimes
of
those
who
had
been
condemned
and
the
punishments
which
they
were
to
undergo
each
prisoner
as
his
sentence
was
read
was
brought
forward
to
the
pulpit
by
the
officers
to
hear
it
standing
up
with
his
wax
candle
lighted
in
his
hand
as
soon
as
the
sentences
of
all
those
whose
lives
had
been
spared
were
read
the
grand
inquisitor
put
on
his
priestly
robes
and
followed
by
several
others
took
off
from
them
the
ban
of
excommunication
which
they
were
supposed
to
have
fallen
under
by
throwing
holy
water
on
them
with
a
small
broom
as
soon
as
this
portion
of
the
ceremony
was
over
those
who
were
condemned
to
suffer
and
the
effigies
of
those
who
had
escaped
by
death
were
brought
up
one
by
one
and
their
sentences
read
the
winding
up
of
the
condemnation
of
all
was
in
the
same
words
that
the
holy
inquisition
found
it
impossible
on
account
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
the
magnitude
of
their
crimes
to
pardon
them
with
great
concern
it
handed
them
over
to
secular
justice
to
undergo
the
penalty
of
the
laws
exhorting
the
authorities
at
the
same
time
to
show
clemency
and
mercy
towards
the
unhappy
wretches
and
if
they
must
suffer
death
that
at
all
events
it
might
be
without
the
spilling
of
blood
what
mockery
was
this
apparent
intercession
not
to
shied
blood
when
to
comply
with
their
request
they
substituted
the
torment
and
agony
of
the
stake
amine
was
the
last
who
was
led
forward
to
the
pulpit
which
was
fixed
against
one
of
the
massive
columns
of
the
centre
aisle
close
to
the
throne
occupied
by
the
grand
inquisitor
you
amine
vanderdecken
cried
the
public
accuser
at
this
moment
an
unusual
bustle
was
heard
in
the
crowd
under
the
pulpit
there
was
struggling
and
expostulation
and
the
officers
raised
their
wands
for
silence
and
decorum--but
it
continued
you
amine
vanderdecken
being
accused--
another
violent
struggle
and
from
the
crowd
darted
a
young
man
who
rushed
to
where
amine
was
standing
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
philip
philip
screamed
amine
falling
on
his
bosom
as
he
caught
her
the
cap
of
flames
fell
off
her
head
and
rolled
along
the
marble
pavement
my
amine--my
wife--my
adored
one--is
it
thus
we
meet
my
lord
she
is
innocent
stand
off
men
continued
he
to
the
officers
of
the
inquisition
who
would
have
torn
them
asunder
stand
off
or
your
lives
shall
answer
for
it
this
threat
to
the
officers
and
the
defiance
of
all
rules
were
not
to
be
borne
the
whole
cathedral
was
in
a
state
of
commotion
and
the
solemnity
of
the
ceremony
was
about
to
be
compromised
the
viceroy
and
his
followers
had
risen
from
their
chairs
to
observe
what
was
passing
and
the
crowd
was
pressing
on
when
the
grand
inquisitor
gave
his
directions
and
other
officers
hastened
to
the
assistance
of
the
two
who
had
led
amine
forward
and
proceeded
to
disengage
her
from
philip's
arms
the
struggle
was
severe
philip
appeared
to
be
endued
with
the
strength
of
twenty
men
and
it
was
some
minutes
before
they
could
succeed
in
separating
him
and
when
they
had
so
done
his
struggles
were
dreadful
amine
also
held
by
two
of
the
familiars
shrieked
as
she
attempted
once
more
but
in
vain
to
rush
into
her
husband's
arms
at
last
by
a
tremendous
effort
philip
released
himself
but
as
soon
as
he
was
released
he
sank
down
helpless
on
the
pavement
the
exertion
had
caused
the
bursting
of
a
blood-vessel
and
he
lay
without
motion
oh
god
oh
god
they
have
killed
him
monsters--murderers--let
me
embrace
him
but
once
more
cried
amine
frantically
a
priest
now
stepped
forward--it
was
father
mathias--with
sorrow
in
his
countenance
he
desired
some
of
the
bystanders
to
carry
out
philip
vanderdecken
and
philip
in
a
state
of
insensibility
was
borne
away
from
the
sight
of
amine
the
blood
streaming
from
his
mouth
amine's
sentence
was
read--she
heard
it
not
her
brain
was
bewildered
she
was
led
back
to
her
seat
and
then
it
was
that
all
her
courage
all
her
constancy
and
fortitude
gave
way
and
during
the
remainder
of
the
ceremony
she
filled
the
cathedral
with
her
wild
hysterical
sobbing
all
entreaties
or
threats
being
wholly
lost
upon
her
all
was
now
over
except
the
last
and
most
tragical
scene
of
the
drama
the
culprits
who
had
been
spared
were
led
back
to
the
inquisition
by
their
godfathers
and
those
who
had
been
sentenced
were
taken
down
to
the
banks
of
the
river
to
suffer
it
was
on
a
large
open
space
on
the
left
of
the
custom-house
that
this
ceremony
was
to
be
gone
through
as
in
the
cathedral
raised
thrones
were
prepared
for
the
grand
inquisitor
and
the
who
in
state
headed
the
procession
followed
by
an
immense
concourse
of
people
thirteen
stakes
had
been
set
up
eight
for
the
living
or
the
dead
the
executioners
were
sitting
on
or
standing
by
the
piles
of
wood
and
faggots
waiting
for
their
victims
amine
could
not
walk
she
was
at
first
supported
by
the
familiars
and
then
carried
by
them
to
the
stake
which
had
been
assigned
for
her
when
they
put
her
on
her
feet
opposite
to
it
her
courage
appeared
to
revive
she
walked
boldly
up
folded
her
arms
and
leant
against
it
the
executioners
now
commenced
their
office
the
chains
were
passed
round
amine's
body--the
wood
and
faggots
piled
around
her
the
same
preparations
had
been
made
with
all
the
other
culprits
and
the
confessors
stood
by
the
side
of
each
victim
amine
waved
her
hand
indignantly
to
those
who
approached
her
when
father
mathias
almost
breathless
made
his
appearance
from
the
crowd
through
which
he
had
forced
his
way
amine
vanderdecken--unhappy
woman
had
you
been
counselled
by
me
this
would
not
have
been
now
it
is
too
late
but
not
too
late
to
save
your
soul
away
then
with
this
obstinacy--this
hardness
of
heart
call
upon
the
blessed
saviour
that
he
may
receive
your
spirit--call
upon
his
wound's
for
mercy
it
is
the
eleventh
hour
but
not
too
late
amine
continued
the
old
man
with
tears
i
implore
you
i
conjure
you
at
least
may
this
load
of
trouble
be
taken
from
my
heart
unhappy
woman'
you
say
replied
she
say
rather
unhappy
priest'
for
amine's
sufferings
will
soon
be
over
while
you
must
still
endure
the
torments
of
the
damned
unhappy
was
the
day
when
my
husband
rescued
you
from
death
still
more
unhappy
the
compassion
which
prompted
him
to
offer
you
an
asylum
and
a
refuge
unhappy
the
knowledge
of
you
from
the
first
day
to
the
last
i
leave
you
to
your
conscience--if
conscience
you
retain--nor
would
i
change
this
cruel
death
for
the
pangs
which
you
in
your
future
life
will
suffer
leave
me--i
die
in
the
faith
of
my
forefathers
and
scorn
a
creed
that
warrants
such
a
scene
as
this
amine
vanderdecken
cried
the
priest
on
his
knees
clasping
his
hands
in
agony
leave
me
father
there
is
but
a
minute
left--for
the
love
of
god--
i
tell
you
then
leave
me--that
minute
is
my
own
father
mathias
turned
away
in
despair
and
the
tears
coursed
down
the
old
man's
cheeks
as
amine
said
his
misery
was
extreme
the
head
executioner
now
inquired
of
the
confessors
whether
the
culprits
died
in
the
true
faith
if
answered
in
the
affirmative
a
rope
was
passed
round
their
necks
and
twisted
to
the
stake
so
that
they
were
strangled
before
the
fire
was
kindled
all
the
other
culprits
had
died
in
this
manner
and
the
head
executioner
inquired
of
father
mathias
whether
amine
had
a
claim
to
so
much
mercy
the
old
priest
answered
not
but
shook
his
head
the
executioner
turned
away
after
a
moment's
pause
father
mathias
followed
him
and
seized
him
by
the
arm
saying
in
a
faltering
voice
let
her
not
suffer
long
the
grand
inquisitor
gave
the
signal
and
the
fires
were
all
lighted
at
the
same
moment
in
compliance
with
the
request
of
the
priest
the
executioner
had
thrown
a
quantity
of
wet
straw
upon
amine's
pile
which
threw
up
a
dense
smoke
before
it
burst
into
flames
mother
mother
i
come
to
thee
were
the
last
words
heard
from
amine's
lips
the
flames
soon
raged
furiously
ascending
high
above
the
top
of
the
stake
to
which
she
had
been
chained
gradually
they
sunk
down
and
only
when
the
burning
embers
covered
the
ground
a
few
fragments
of
bones
hanging
on
the
chain
were
all
that
remained
of
the
once
peerless
and
high-minded
amine
years
have
passed
away
since
we
related
amine's
sufferings
and
cruel
death
and
now
once
more
we
bring
philip
vanderdecken
on
the
scene
and
during
this
time
where
has
he
been
a
lunatic--at
one
time
frantic
chained
coerced
with
blows
at
others
mild
and
peaceable
reason
occasionally
appeared
to
burst
out
again
as
the
sun
on
a
cloudy
day
and
then
it
was
again
obscured
for
many
years
there
was
one
who
watched
him
carefully
and
lived
in
hope
to
witness
his
return
to
a
sane
mind
he
watched
in
sorrow
and
remorse--he
died
without
his
desires
being
gratified
this
was
father
mathias
the
cottage
at
terneuse
had
long
fallen
into
ruin
for
many
years
it
waited
the
return
of
its
owners
and
at
last
the
heirs-at-law
claimed
and
recovered
the
substance
of
philip
vanderdecken
even
the
fate
of
amine
had
passed
from
the
recollection
of
most
people
although
her
portrait
over
burning
coals
with
her
crime
announced
beneath
it
still
hangs--as
is
the
custom
in
the
church
of
the
inquisition--attracting
from
its
expressive
beauty
the
attention
of
the
most
careless
passers-by
but
many
many
years
have
rolled
away--philip's
hair
is
white--his
once
powerful
frame
is
broken
down--and
he
appears
much
older
than
he
really
is
he
is
now
sane
but
his
vigour
is
gone
weary
of
life
all
he
wishes
for
is
to
execute
his
mission--and
then
to
welcome
death
the
relic
has
never
been
taken
from
him
he
has
been
discharged
from
the
lunatic-asylum
and
has
been
provided
with
the
means
of
returning
to
his
country
alas
he
has
now
no
country--no
home--nothing
in
the
world
to
induce
him
to
remain
in
it
all
he
asks
is--to
do
his
duty
and
to
die
the
ship
was
ready
to
sail
for
europe
and
philip
vanderdecken
went
on
board--hardly
caring
whither
he
went
to
return
to
terneuse
was
not
his
object
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
revisiting
the
scene
of
so
much
happiness
and
so
much
misery
amine's
form
was
engraven
on
his
heart
and
he
looked
forward
with
impatience
to
the
time
when
he
should
be
summoned
to
join
her
in
the
land
of
spirits
he
had
awakened
as
from
a
dream
after
so
many
years
of
aberration
of
intellect
he
was
no
longer
the
sincere
catholic
that
he
had
been
for
he
never
thought
of
religion
without
his
amine's
cruel
fate
being
brought
to
his
recollection
still
he
clung
on
to
the
relic--he
believed
in
that--and
that
only
it
was
his
god--his
creed--his
everything--the
passport
for
himself
and
for
his
father
into
the
next
world--the
means
whereby
he
should
join
his
amine--and
for
hours
would
he
remain
holding
in
his
hand
that
object
so
valued--gazing
upon
it--
recalling
every
important
event
in
his
life
from
the
death
of
his
poor
mother
and
his
first
sight
of
amine
to
the
last
dreadful
scene
it
was
to
him
a
journal
of
his
existence
and
on
it
were
fixed
all
his
hopes
for
the
future
when
oh
when
is
it
to
be
accomplished
was
the
constant
subject
of
his
reveries
blessed
indeed
will
be
the
day
when
i
leave
this
world
of
hate
and
seek
that
other
in
which
the
weary
are
at
rest
the
vessel
on
board
of
which
philip
was
embarked
as
a
passenger
was
the
nostra
senora
da
monte
a
brig
of
three
hundred
tons
bound
for
lisbon
the
captain
was
an
old
portuguese
full
of
superstition
and
fond
of
arrack--a
fondness
rather
unusual
with
the
people
of
his
nation
they
sailed
from
goa
and
philip
was
standing
abaft
and
sadly
contemplating
the
spire
of
the
cathedral
in
which
he
had
last
parted
with
his
wife
when
his
elbow
was
touched
and
he
turned
round
fellow-passenger
again
said
a
well-known
voice--it
was
that
of
the
pilot
schriften
there
was
no
alteration
in
the
man's
appearance
he
showed
no
marks
of
declining
years
his
one
eye
glared
as
keenly
as
ever
philip
started
not
only
at
the
sight
of
the
man
but
at
the
reminiscences
which
his
unexpected
appearance
brought
to
his
mind
it
was
but
for
a
second
and
he
was
again
calm
and
pensive
you
here
again
schriften
observed
philip
i
trust
your
appearance
forebodes
the
accomplishment
of
my
task
perhaps
it
does
replied
the
pilot
we
both
are
weary
philip
made
no
reply
he
did
not
even
ask
schriften
in
what
manner
he
had
escaped
from
the
fort
he
was
indifferent
about
it
for
he
felt
that
the
man
had
a
charmed
life
many
are
the
vessels
that
have
been
wrecked
philip
vanderdecken
and
many
the
souls
summoned
to
their
account
by
meeting
with
your
father's
ship
while
you
have
been
so
long
shut
up
observed
the
pilot
may
our
next
meeting
with
him
be
more
fortunate--may
it
be
the
last
replied
philip
no
no
rather
may
he
fulfil
his
doom
and
sail
till
the
day
of
judgment
replied
the
pilot
with
emphasis
vile
caitiff
i
have
a
foreboding
that
you
will
not
have
your
detestable
wish
away--leave
me
or
you
shall
find
that
although
this
head
is
blanched
by
misery
this
arm
has
still
some
power
schriften
scowled
as
he
walked
away
he
appeared
to
have
some
fear
of
philip
although
it
was
not
equal
to
his
hate
he
now
resumed
his
former
attempts
of
stirring
up
the
ship's
company
against
philip
declaring
that
he
was
a
jonah
who
would
occasion
the
loss
of
the
ship
and
that
he
was
connected
with
the
flying
dutchman
philip
very
soon
observed
that
he
was
avoided
and
he
resorted
to
counter-statements
equally
injurious
to
schriften
whom
he
declared
to
be
a
demon
the
appearance
of
schriften
was
so
much
against
him
while
that
of
philip
on
the
contrary
was
so
prepossessing
that
the
people
on
board
hardly
knew
what
to
think
they
were
divided
some
were
on
the
side
of
philip--some
on
that
of
schriften
the
captain
and
many
others
looking
with
equal
horror
upon
both
and
longing
for
the
time
when
they
could
be
sent
out
of
the
vessel
the
captain
as
we
have
before
observed
was
very
superstitious
and
very
fond
of
his
bottle
in
the
morning
he
would
be
sober
and
pray
in
the
afternoon
he
would
be
drunk
and
swear
at
the
very
saints
whose
protection
he
had
invoked
but
a
few
hours
before
may
holy
saint
antonio
preserve
us
and
keep
us
from
temptation
said
he
on
the
morning
after
a
conversation
with
the
passengers
about
the
phantom
ship
all
the
saints
protect
us
from
harm
continued
he
taking
off
his
hat
reverentially
and
crossing
himself
let
me
but
rid
myself
of
these
two
dangerous
men
without
accident
and
i
will
offer
up
a
hundred
wax
candles
of
three
ounces
each
to
the
shrine
of
the
virgin
upon
my
safe
anchoring
off
the
tower
of
belem
in
the
evening
he
changed
his
language
now
if
that
maldetto
saint
antonio
don't
help
us
may
he
feel
the
coals
of
hell
yet
damn
him
and
his
pigs
too
if
he
has
the
courage
to
do
his
duty
all
will
be
well
but
he
is
a
cowardly
wretch
he
cares
for
nobody
and
will
not
help
those
who
call
upon
him
in
trouble
carambo
that
for
you
exclaimed
the
captain
looking
at
the
small
shrine
of
the
saint
at
the
bittacle
and
snapping
his
fingers
at
the
image
that
for
you
you
useless
wretch
who
never
help
us
in
our
trouble
the
pope
must
canonise
some
better
saints
for
us
for
all
we
have
now
are
worn
out
they
could
do
something
formerly
but
now
i
would
not
give
two
ounces
of
gold
for
the
whole
calendar
as
for
you
you
lazy
old
scoundrel--
continued
the
captain
shaking
his
fist
at
poor
saint
antonio
the
ship
had
now
gained
off
the
southern
coast
of
africa
and
was
about
one
hundred
miles
from
the
lagullas
coast
the
morning
was
beautiful
a
slight
ripple
only
turned
over
the
waves
the
breeze
was
light
and
steady
and
the
vessel
was
standing
on
a
wind
at
the
rate
of
about
four
miles
an
hour
blessed
be
the
holy
saints
said
the
captain
who
had
just
gained
the
deck
another
little
slant
in
our
favour
and
we
shall
lay
our
course
again
i
say
blessed
be
the
holy
saints
and
particularly
our
worthy
patron
saint
antonio
who
has
taken
under
his
peculiar
protection
the
nostra
senora
da
monte
we
have
a
prospect
of
fine
weather
come
signors
let
us
down
to
breakfast
and
after
breakfast
we
enjoy
our
cigarros
upon
the
deck
but
the
scene
was
soon
changed
a
bank
of
clouds
rose
up
from
the
eastward
with
a
rapidity
that
to
the
seamen's
eyes
was
unnatural
and
it
soon
covered
the
whole
firmament
the
sun
was
obscured
and
all
was
one
deep
and
unnatural
gloom
the
wind
subsided
and
the
ocean
was
hushed
it
was
not
exactly
dark
but
the
heavens
were
covered
with
one
red
haze
which
gave
an
appearance
as
if
the
world
was
in
a
state
of
conflagration
in
the
cabin
the
increased
darkness
was
first
observed
by
philip
who
went
on
deck
he
was
followed
by
the
captain
and
passengers
who
were
in
a
state
of
amazement
it
was
unnatural
and
incomprehensible
now
holy
virgin
protect
us--what
can
this
be
exclaimed
the
captain
in
a
fright
holy
saint
antonio
protect
us--but
this
is
awful
there--there
shouted
the
sailors
pointing
to
the
beam
of
the
vessel
every
eye
looked
over
the
gunnel
to
witness
what
had
occasioned
such
exclamations
philip
schriften
and
the
captain
were
side
by
side
on
the
beam
of
the
ship
not
more
than
two
cables'
length
distant
they
beheld
slowly
rising
out
of
the
water
the
tapering
masthead
and
spars
of
another
vessel
she
rose
and
rose
gradually
her
topmasts
and
topsail
yards
with
the
sails
set
next
made
their
appearance
higher
and
higher
she
rose
up
from
the
element
her
lower
masts
and
rigging
and
lastly
her
hull
showed
itself
above
the
surface
still
she
rose
up
till
her
ports
with
her
guns
and
at
last
the
whole
of
her
floatage
was
above
water
and
there
she
remained
close
to
them
with
her
main
yard
squared
and
hove-to
holy
virgin
exclaimed
the
captain
breathless
i
have
known
ships
to
go
down
but
never
to
come
up
before
now
will
i
give
one
thousand
candles
of
ten
ounces
each
to
the
shrine
of
the
virgin
to
save
us
in
this
trouble
one
thousand
wax
candles
hear
me
blessed
lady
ten
ounces
each
gentlemen
cried
the
captain
to
the
passengers
who
stood
aghast
why
don't
you
promise--promise
i
say
promise
at
all
events
the
phantom
ship--the
flying
dutchman
shrieked
schriften
i
told
you
so
philip
vanderdecken
there
is
your
father--he
he
philip's
eyes
had
remained
fixed
on
the
vessel
he
perceived
that
they
were
lowering
down
a
boat
from
her
quarter
it
is
possible
thought
he
i
shall
now
be
permitted
and
philip
put
his
hand
into
his
bosom
and
grasped
the
relic
the
gloom
now
increased
so
that
the
strange
vessel's
hull
could
but
just
be
discovered
through
the
murky
atmosphere
the
seamen
and
passengers
threw
themselves
down
on
their
knees
and
invoked
their
saints
the
captain
ran
down
for
a
candle
to
light
before
the
image
of
st
antonio
which
he
took
out
of
its
shrine
and
kissed
with
much
apparent
affection
and
devotion
and
then
replaced
shortly
afterwards
the
splash
of
oars
was
heard
alongside
and
a
voice
calling
out
i
say
my
good
people
give
us
a
rope
from
forward
no
one
answered
or
complied
with
the
request
schriften
only
went
up
to
the
captain
and
told
him
that
if
they
offered
to
send
letters
they
must
not
be
received
or
the
vessel
would
be
doomed
and
all
would
perish
a
man
now
made
his
appearance
from
over
the
gunnel
at
the
gangway
you
might
as
well
have
let
me
had
a
side-rope
my
hearties
said
he
as
he
stepped
on
deck
where
is
the
captain
here
replied
the
captain
trembling
from
head
to
foot
the
man
who
accosted
him
appeared
a
weather-beaten
seaman
dressed
in
a
fur
cap
and
canvas
petticoats
he
held
some
letters
in
his
hand
what
do
you
want
at
last
screamed
the
captain
yes--what
do
you
want
continued
schriften
he
he
what
you
here
pilot
observed
the
man--well--i
thought
you
had
gone
to
davy's
locker
long
enough
ago
he
he
replied
schriften
turning
away
why
the
fact
is
captain
we
have
had
very
foul
weather
and
we
wish
to
send
letters
home
i
do
believe
that
we
shall
never
get
round
this
cape
i
can't
take
them
cried
the
captain
can't
take
them
well
it's
very
odd
but
every
ship
refuses
to
take
our
letters
it's
very
unkind
seamen
should
have
a
feeling
for
brother
seamen
especially
in
distress
god
knows
we
wish
to
see
our
wives
and
families
again
and
it
would
be
a
matter
of
comfort
to
them
if
they
only
could
hear
from
us
i
cannot
take
your
letters--the
saints
preserve
us
replied
the
captain
we
have
been
a
long
while
out
said
the
seaman
shaking
his
head
how
long
inquired
the
captain
not
knowing
what
to
say
we
can't
tell
our
almanack
was
blown
overboard
and
we
have
lost
our
reckoning
we
never
have
our
latitude
exact
now
for
we
cannot
tell
the
sun's
declination
for
the
right
day
let
me
see
your
letters
said
philip
advancing
and
taking
them
out
of
the
seaman's
hands
they
must
not
be
touched
screamed
schriften
out
monster
replied
philip
who
dares
interfere
with
me
doomed--doomed--doomed
shrieked
schriften
running
up
and
down
the
deck
and
then
breaking
into
a
wild
fit
of
laughter
touch
not
the
letters
said
the
captain
trembling
as
if
in
an
ague
fit
philip
made
no
reply
but
held
his
hand
out
for
the
letters
here
is
one
from
our
second
mate
to
his
wife
at
amsterdam
who
lives
on
waser
quay
waser
quay
has
long
been
gone
my
good
friend
there
is
now
a
large
dock
for
ships
where
it
once
was
replied
philip
impossible
replied
the
man
here
is
another
from
the
boatswain
to
his
father
who
lives
in
the
old
market-place
the
old
market-place
has
long
been
pulled
down
and
there
now
stands
a
church
upon
the
spot
impossible
replied
the
seaman
here
is
another
from
myself
to
my
sweetheart
vrow
ketser--with
money
to
buy
her
a
new
brooch
philip
shook
his
head
i
remember
seeing
an
old
lady
of
that
name
buried
some
thirty
years
ago
impossible
i
left
her
young
and
blooming
here's
one
for
the
house
of
slutz
and
company
to
whom
the
ship
belongs
there's
no
such
house
now
replied
philip
but
i
have
heard
that
many
years
ago
there
was
a
firm
of
that
name
impossible
you
must
be
laughing
at
me
here
is
a
letter
from
our
captain
to
his
son--
give
it
me
cried
philip
seizing
the
letter
he
was
about
to
break
the
seal
when
schriften
snatched
it
out
of
his
hand
and
threw
it
over
the
lee
gunnel
that's
a
scurvy
trick
for
an
old
shipmate
observed
the
seaman
schriften
made
no
reply
but
catching
up
the
other
letters
which
philip
had
laid
down
on
the
capstan
he
hurled
them
after
the
first
the
strange
seaman
shed
tears
and
walked
again
to
the
side
it
is
very
hard--very
unkind
observed
he
as
he
descended
the
time
may
come
when
you
may
wish
that
your
family
should
know
your
situation
so
saying
he
disappeared
in
a
few
seconds
was
heard
the
sound
of
the
oars
retreating
from
the
ship
holy
st
antonio
exclaimed
the
captain
i
am
lost
in
wonder
and
fright
steward
bring
me
up
the
arrack
the
steward
ran
down
for
the
bottle
being
as
much
alarmed
as
his
captain
he
helped
himself
before
he
brought
it
up
to
his
commander
now
said
the
captain
after
keeping
his
mouth
for
two
minutes
to
the
bottle
and
draining
it
to
the
bottom
what
is
to
be
done
next
i'll
tell
you
said
schriften
going
up
to
him
that
man
there
has
a
charm
hung
round
his
neck
take
it
from
him
and
throw
it
overboard
and
your
ship
will
be
saved
if
not
it
will
be
lost
with
every
soul
on
board
yes
yes
it's
all
right
depend
upon
it
cried
the
sailors
fools
replied
philip
do
you
believe
that
wretch
did
you
not
hear
the
man
who
came
on
board
recognise
him
and
call
him
shipmate
he
is
the
party
whose
presence
on
board
will
prove
so
unfortunate
yes
yes
cried
the
sailors
it's
all
right
the
man
did
call
him
shipmate
i
tell
you
it's
all
wrong
cried
schriften
that
is
the
man
let
him
give
up
the
charm
yes
yes
let
him
give
up
the
charm
cried
the
sailors
and
they
rushed
upon
philip
philip
started
back
to
where
the
captain
stood
madmen
know
ye
what
ye
are
about
it
is
the
holy
cross
that
i
wear
round
my
neck
throw
it
overboard
if
you
dare
and
your
souls
are
lost
for
ever
and
philip
took
the
relic
from
his
bosom
and
showed
it
to
the
captain
no
no
men
exclaimed
the
captain
who
was
now
more
settled
in
his
nerves
that
won't
do--the
saints
protect
us
the
seamen
however
became
clamorous
one
portion
were
for
throwing
schriften
overboard
the
other
for
throwing
philip
at
last
the
point
was
decided
by
the
captain
who
directed
the
small
skiff
hanging
astern
to
be
lowered
down
and
ordered
both
philip
and
schriften
to
get
into
it
the
seamen
approved
of
this
arrangement
as
it
satisfied
both
parties
philip
made
no
objection
schriften
screamed
and
fought
but
he
was
tossed
into
the
boat
there
he
remained
trembling
in
the
stern-sheets
while
philip
who
had
seized
the
sculls
pulled
away
from
the
vessel
in
the
direction
of
the
phantom
ship
in
a
few
minutes
the
vessel
which
philip
and
schriften
had
left
was
no
longer
to
be
discerned
through
the
thick
haze
the
phantom
ship
was
still
in
sight
but
at
a
much
greater
distance
from
them
than
she
was
before
philip
pulled
hard
towards
her
but
although
hove
to
she
appeared
to
increase
her
distance
from
the
boat
for
a
short
time
he
paused
on
his
oars
to
regain
his
breath
when
schriften
rose
up
and
took
his
seat
in
the
stern-sheets
of
the
boat
you
may
pull
and
pull
philip
vanderdecken
observed
schriften
but
you
will
not
gain
that
ship--no
no
that
cannot
be--we
may
have
a
long
cruise
together
but
you
will
be
as
far
from
your
object
at
the
end
of
it
as
you
are
now
at
the
commencement--why
don't
you
throw
me
overboard
again
you
would
be
all
the
lighter--he
he
i
threw
you
overboard
in
a
state
of
phrenzy
replied
philip
when
you
attempted
to
force
from
me
my
relic
and
have
i
not
endeavoured
to
make
others
take
it
from
you
this
very
day--have
i
not--he
he
you
have
rejoined
philip
but
i
am
now
convinced
that
you
are
as
unhappy
as
myself
and
that
in
what
you
are
doing
you
are
only
following
your
destiny
as
i
am
mine
why
and
wherefore
i
cannot
tell
but
we
are
both
engaged
in
the
same
mystery--if
the
success
of
my
endeavours
depends
upon
guarding
the
relic
the
success
of
yours
depends
upon
your
obtaining
it
and
defeating
my
purpose
by
so
doing
in
this
matter
we
are
both
agents
and
you
have
been
as
far
as
my
mission
is
concerned
my
most
active
enemy
but
schriften
i
have
not
forgotten
and
never
will
that
you
kindly
did
advise
my
poor
amine
that
you
prophesied
to
her
what
would
be
her
fate
if
she
did
not
listen
to
your
counsel
that
you
were
no
enemy
of
hers
although
you
have
been
and
are
still
mine
although
my
enemy
for
her
sake
i
forgive
you
and
will
not
attempt
to
harm
you
you
do
then
forgive
your
enemy
philip
vanderdecken
replied
schriften
mournfully
for
such
i
acknowledge
myself
to
be
i
do
with
all
my
heart
with
all
my
soul
replied
philip
then
have
you
conquered
me
philip
vanderdecken
you
have
now
made
me
your
friend
and
your
wishes
are
about
to
be
accomplished
you
would
know
who
i
am
listen--when
your
father
defying
the
almighty's
will
in
his
rage
took
my
life
he
was
vouchsafed
a
chance
of
his
doom
being
cancelled
through
the
merits
of
his
son
i
had
also
my
appeal
which
was
for
vengeance
it
was
granted
that
i
should
remain
on
earth
and
thwart
your
will
that
as
long
as
we
were
enemies
you
should
not
succeed
but
that
when
you
had
conformed
to
the
highest
attribute
of
christianity
proved
on
the
holy
cross
that
of
forgiving
your
enemy
your
task
should
be
fulfilled
philip
vanderdecken
you
have
forgiven
your
enemy
and
both
our
destinies
are
now
accomplished
as
schriften
spoke
philip's
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
he
extended
his
hand
to
philip--it
was
taken
and
as
it
was
pressed
the
form
of
the
pilot
wasted
as
it
were
into
the
air
and
philip
found
himself
alone
father
of
mercy
i
thank
thee
said
philip
that
my
task
is
done
and
that
i
again
may
meet
my
amine
philip
then
pulled
towards
the
phantom
ship
and
found
that
she
no
longer
appeared
to
leave
on
the
contrary
every
minute
he
was
nearer
and
nearer
and
at
last
he
threw
in
his
oars
climbed
up
her
sides
and
gained
her
deck
the
crew
of
the
vessel
crowded
round
him
your
captain
said
philip
i
must
speak
with
your
captain
who
shall
i
say
sir
demanded
one
who
appeared
to
be
the
first
mate
who
replied
philip
tell
him
his
son
would
speak
to
him
his
son
philip
vanderdecken
shouts
of
laughter
from
the
crew
followed
this
answer
of
philip's
and
the
mate
as
soon
as
they
ceased
observed
with
a
smile
you
forget
sir
perhaps
you
would
say
his
father
tell
him
his
son
if
you
please
replied
philip
take
no
note
of
grey
hairs
well
sir
here
he
is
coming
forward
replied
the
mate
stepping
aside
and
pointing
to
the
captain
what
is
all
this
inquired
the
captain
are
you
philip
vanderdecken
the
captain
of
this
vessel
i
am
sir
replied
the
other
you
appear
not
to
know
me
but
how
can
you
you
saw
me
but
when
i
was
only
three
years
old
yet
may
you
remember
a
letter
which
you
gave
to
your
wife
ha
replied
the
captain
and
who
then
are
you
time
has
stopped
with
you
but
with
those
who
live
in
the
world
he
stops
not
and
for
those
who
pass
a
life
of
misery
he
hurries
on
still
faster
in
me
behold
your
son
philip
vanderdecken
who
has
obeyed
your
wishes
and
after
a
life
of
such
peril
and
misery
as
few
have
passed
has
at
last
fulfilled
his
vow
and
now
offers
to
his
father
the
precious
relic
that
he
required
to
kiss
philip
drew
out
the
relic
and
held
it
towards
his
father
as
if
a
flash
of
lightning
had
passed
through
his
mind
the
captain
of
the
vessel
started
back
clasped
his
hands
fell
on
his
knees
and
wept
my
son
my
son
exclaimed
he
rising
and
throwing
himself
into
philip's
arms
my
eyes
are
opened--the
almighty
knows
how
long
they
have
been
obscured
embracing
each
other
they
walked
aft
away
from
the
men
who
were
still
crowded
at
the
gangway
my
son
my
noble
son
before
the
charm
is
broken--before
we
resolve
as
we
must
into
the
elements
oh
let
me
kneel
in
thanksgiving
and
contrition
my
son
my
noble
son
receive
a
father's
thanks
exclaimed
vanderdecken
then
with
tears
of
joy
and
penitence
he
humbly
addressed
himself
to
that
being
whom
he
once
so
awfully
defied
the
elder
vanderdecken
knelt
down
philip
did
the
same
still
embracing
each
other
with
one
arm
while
they
raised
on
high
the
other
and
prayed
for
the
last
time
the
relic
was
taken
from
the
bosom
of
philip
and
handed
to
his
father--and
his
father
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
kissed
it
and
as
he
kissed
it
the
long
tapering
upper
spars
of
the
phantom
vessel
the
yards
and
sails
that
were
set
fell
into
dust
fluttered
in
the
air
and
sank
upon
the
wave
the
mainmast
foremast
bowsprit
everything
above
the
deck
crumbled
into
atoms
and
disappeared
again
he
raised
the
relic
to
his
lips
and
the
work
of
destruction
continued--the
heavy
iron
guns
sunk
through
the
decks
and
disappeared
the
crew
of
the
vessel
who
were
looking
on
crumbled
down
into
skeletons
and
dust
and
fragments
of
ragged
garments
and
there
were
none
left
on
board
the
vessel
in
the
semblance
of
life
but
the
father
and
son
once
more
did
he
put
the
sacred
emblem
to
his
lips
and
the
beams
and
timbers
separated
the
decks
of
the
vessel
slowly
sank
and
the
remnants
of
the
hull
floated
upon
the
water
and
as
the
father
and
son--the
one
young
and
vigorous
the
other
old
and
decrepit--still
kneeling
still
embracing
with
their
hands
raised
to
heaven
sank
slowly
under
the
deep
blue
wave
the
lurid
sky
was
for
a
moment
illumined
by
a
lightning
cross
then
did
the
clouds
which
obscured
the
heavens
roll
away
swift
as
thought--the
sun
again
burst
out
in
all
his
splendour--the
rippling
waves
appeared
to
dance
with
joy
the
screaming
sea-gull
again
whirled
in
the
air
and
the
scared
albatross
once
more
slumbered
on
the
wing
the
porpoise
tumbled
and
tossed
in
his
sportive
play
the
albicore
and
dolphin
leaped
from
the
sparkling
sea--all
nature
smiled
as
if
it
rejoiced
that
the
charm
was
dissolved
for
ever
and
that
the
phantom
ship
was
no
more
