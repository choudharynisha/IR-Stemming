a
man
stood
upon
a
railroad
bridge
in
northern
alabama
looking
down
into
the
swift
water
twenty
feet
below
the
man's
hands
were
behind
his
back
the
wrists
bound
with
a
cord
a
rope
closely
encircled
his
neck
it
was
attached
to
a
stout
cross-timber
above
his
head
and
the
slack
fell
to
the
level
of
his
knees
some
loose
boards
laid
upon
the
ties
supporting
the
rails
of
the
railway
supplied
a
footing
for
him
and
his
executioners--two
private
soldiers
of
the
federal
army
directed
by
a
sergeant
who
in
civil
life
may
have
been
a
deputy
sheriff
at
a
short
remove
upon
the
same
temporary
platform
was
an
officer
in
the
uniform
of
his
rank
armed
he
was
a
captain
a
sentinel
at
each
end
of
the
bridge
stood
with
his
rifle
in
the
position
known
as
support
that
is
to
say
vertical
in
front
of
the
left
shoulder
the
hammer
resting
on
the
forearm
thrown
straight
across
the
chest--a
formal
and
unnatural
position
enforcing
an
erect
carriage
of
the
body
it
did
not
appear
to
be
the
duty
of
these
two
men
to
know
what
was
occurring
at
the
center
of
the
bridge
they
merely
blockaded
the
two
ends
of
the
foot
planking
that
traversed
it
beyond
one
of
the
sentinels
nobody
was
in
sight
the
railroad
ran
straight
away
into
a
forest
for
a
hundred
yards
then
curving
was
lost
to
view
doubtless
there
was
an
outpost
farther
along
the
other
bank
of
the
stream
was
open
ground--a
gentle
slope
topped
with
a
stockade
of
vertical
tree
trunks
loopholed
for
rifles
with
a
single
embrasure
through
which
protruded
the
muzzle
of
a
brass
cannon
commanding
the
bridge
midway
up
the
slope
between
the
bridge
and
fort
were
the
spectators--a
single
company
of
infantry
in
line
at
parade
rest
the
butts
of
their
rifles
on
the
ground
the
barrels
inclining
slightly
backward
against
the
right
shoulder
the
hands
crossed
upon
the
stock
a
lieutenant
stood
at
the
right
of
the
line
the
point
of
his
sword
upon
the
ground
his
left
hand
resting
upon
his
right
excepting
the
group
of
four
at
the
center
of
the
bridge
not
a
man
moved
the
company
faced
the
bridge
staring
stonily
motionless
the
sentinels
facing
the
banks
of
the
stream
might
have
been
statues
to
adorn
the
bridge
the
captain
stood
with
folded
arms
silent
observing
the
work
of
his
subordinates
but
making
no
sign
death
is
a
dignitary
who
when
he
comes
announced
is
to
be
received
with
formal
manifestations
of
respect
even
by
those
most
familiar
with
him
in
the
code
of
military
etiquette
silence
and
fixity
are
forms
of
deference
the
man
who
was
engaged
in
being
hanged
was
apparently
about
thirty-five
years
of
age
he
was
a
civilian
if
one
might
judge
from
his
habit
which
was
that
of
a
planter
his
features
were
good--a
straight
nose
firm
mouth
broad
forehead
from
which
his
long
dark
hair
was
combed
straight
back
falling
behind
his
ears
to
the
collar
of
his
well
fitting
frock
coat
he
wore
a
moustache
and
pointed
beard
but
no
whiskers
his
eyes
were
large
and
dark
gray
and
had
a
kindly
expression
which
one
would
hardly
have
expected
in
one
whose
neck
was
in
the
hemp
evidently
this
was
no
vulgar
assassin
the
liberal
military
code
makes
provision
for
hanging
many
kinds
of
persons
and
gentlemen
are
not
excluded
the
preparations
being
complete
the
two
private
soldiers
stepped
aside
and
each
drew
away
the
plank
upon
which
he
had
been
standing
the
sergeant
turned
to
the
captain
saluted
and
placed
himself
immediately
behind
that
officer
who
in
turn
moved
apart
one
pace
these
movements
left
the
condemned
man
and
the
sergeant
standing
on
the
two
ends
of
the
same
plank
which
spanned
three
of
the
cross-ties
of
the
bridge
the
end
upon
which
the
civilian
stood
almost
but
not
quite
reached
a
fourth
this
plank
had
been
held
in
place
by
the
weight
of
the
captain
it
was
now
held
by
that
of
the
sergeant
at
a
signal
from
the
former
the
latter
would
step
aside
the
plank
would
tilt
and
the
condemned
man
go
down
between
two
ties
the
arrangement
commended
itself
to
his
judgement
as
simple
and
effective
his
face
had
not
been
covered
nor
his
eyes
bandaged
he
looked
a
moment
at
his
unsteadfast
footing
then
let
his
gaze
wander
to
the
swirling
water
of
the
stream
racing
madly
beneath
his
feet
a
piece
of
dancing
driftwood
caught
his
attention
and
his
eyes
followed
it
down
the
current
how
slowly
it
appeared
to
move
what
a
sluggish
stream
he
closed
his
eyes
in
order
to
fix
his
last
thoughts
upon
his
wife
and
children
the
water
touched
to
gold
by
the
early
sun
the
brooding
mists
under
the
banks
at
some
distance
down
the
stream
the
fort
the
soldiers
the
piece
of
drift--all
had
distracted
him
and
now
he
became
conscious
of
a
new
disturbance
striking
through
the
thought
of
his
dear
ones
was
sound
which
he
could
neither
ignore
nor
understand
a
sharp
distinct
metallic
percussion
like
the
stroke
of
a
blacksmith's
hammer
upon
the
anvil
it
had
the
same
ringing
quality
he
wondered
what
it
was
and
whether
immeasurably
distant
or
near
by--
it
seemed
both
its
recurrence
was
regular
but
as
slow
as
the
tolling
of
a
death
knell
he
awaited
each
new
stroke
with
impatience
and--he
knew
not
why--apprehension
the
intervals
of
silence
grew
progressively
longer
the
delays
became
maddening
with
their
greater
infrequency
the
sounds
increased
in
strength
and
sharpness
they
hurt
his
ear
like
the
thrust
of
a
knife
he
feared
he
would
shriek
what
he
heard
was
the
ticking
of
his
watch
he
unclosed
his
eyes
and
saw
again
the
water
below
him
if
i
could
free
my
hands
he
thought
i
might
throw
off
the
noose
and
spring
into
the
stream
by
diving
i
could
evade
the
bullets
and
swimming
vigorously
reach
the
bank
take
to
the
woods
and
get
away
home
my
home
thank
god
is
as
yet
outside
their
lines
my
wife
and
little
ones
are
still
beyond
the
invader's
farthest
advance
as
these
thoughts
which
have
here
to
be
set
down
in
words
were
flashed
into
the
doomed
man's
brain
rather
than
evolved
from
it
the
captain
nodded
to
the
sergeant
the
sergeant
stepped
aside
ii
peyton
farquhar
was
a
well
to
do
planter
of
an
old
and
highly
respected
alabama
family
being
a
slave
owner
and
like
other
slave
owners
a
politician
he
was
naturally
an
original
secessionist
and
ardently
devoted
to
the
southern
cause
circumstances
of
an
imperious
nature
which
it
is
unnecessary
to
relate
here
had
prevented
him
from
taking
service
with
that
gallant
army
which
had
fought
the
disastrous
campaigns
ending
with
the
fall
of
corinth
and
he
chafed
under
the
inglorious
restraint
longing
for
the
release
of
his
energies
the
larger
life
of
the
soldier
the
opportunity
for
distinction
that
opportunity
he
felt
would
come
as
it
comes
to
all
in
wartime
meanwhile
he
did
what
he
could
no
service
was
too
humble
for
him
to
perform
in
the
aid
of
the
south
no
adventure
too
perilous
for
him
to
undertake
if
consistent
with
the
character
of
a
civilian
who
was
at
heart
a
soldier
and
who
in
good
faith
and
without
too
much
qualification
assented
to
at
least
a
part
of
the
frankly
villainous
dictum
that
all
is
fair
in
love
and
war
one
evening
while
farquhar
and
his
wife
were
sitting
on
a
rustic
bench
near
the
entrance
to
his
grounds
a
gray-clad
soldier
rode
up
to
the
gate
and
asked
for
a
drink
of
water
mrs
farquhar
was
only
too
happy
to
serve
him
with
her
own
white
hands
while
she
was
fetching
the
water
her
husband
approached
the
dusty
horseman
and
inquired
eagerly
for
news
from
the
front
the
yanks
are
repairing
the
railroads
said
the
man
and
are
getting
ready
for
another
advance
they
have
reached
the
owl
creek
bridge
put
it
in
order
and
built
a
stockade
on
the
north
bank
the
commandant
has
issued
an
order
which
is
posted
everywhere
declaring
that
any
civilian
caught
interfering
with
the
railroad
its
bridges
tunnels
or
trains
will
be
summarily
hanged
i
saw
the
order
how
far
is
it
to
the
owl
creek
bridge
farquhar
asked
about
thirty
miles
is
there
no
force
on
this
side
of
the
creek
only
a
picket
post
half
a
mile
out
on
the
railroad
and
a
single
sentinel
at
this
end
of
the
bridge
suppose
a
man--a
civilian
and
student
of
hanging--should
elude
the
picket
post
and
perhaps
get
the
better
of
the
sentinel
said
farquhar
smiling
what
could
he
accomplish
the
soldier
reflected
i
was
there
a
month
ago
he
replied
i
observed
that
the
flood
of
last
winter
had
lodged
a
great
quantity
of
driftwood
against
the
wooden
pier
at
this
end
of
the
bridge
it
is
now
dry
and
would
burn
like
tinder
the
lady
had
now
brought
the
water
which
the
soldier
drank
he
thanked
her
ceremoniously
bowed
to
her
husband
and
rode
away
an
hour
later
after
nightfall
he
repassed
the
plantation
going
northward
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come
he
was
a
federal
scout
iii
as
peyton
farquhar
fell
straight
downward
through
the
bridge
he
lost
consciousness
and
was
as
one
already
dead
from
this
state
he
was
awakened--ages
later
it
seemed
to
him--by
the
pain
of
a
sharp
pressure
upon
his
throat
followed
by
a
sense
of
suffocation
keen
poignant
agonies
seemed
to
shoot
from
his
neck
downward
through
every
fiber
of
his
body
and
limbs
these
pains
appeared
to
flash
along
well
defined
lines
of
ramification
and
to
beat
with
an
inconceivably
rapid
periodicity
they
seemed
like
streams
of
pulsating
fire
heating
him
to
an
intolerable
temperature
as
to
his
head
he
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
a
feeling
of
fullness--of
congestion
these
sensations
were
unaccompanied
by
thought
the
intellectual
part
of
his
nature
was
already
effaced
he
had
power
only
to
feel
and
feeling
was
torment
he
was
conscious
of
motion
encompassed
in
a
luminous
cloud
of
which
he
was
now
merely
the
fiery
heart
without
material
substance
he
swung
through
unthinkable
arcs
of
oscillation
like
a
vast
pendulum
then
all
at
once
with
terrible
suddenness
the
light
about
him
shot
upward
with
the
noise
of
a
loud
splash
a
frightful
roaring
was
in
his
ears
and
all
was
cold
and
dark
the
power
of
thought
was
restored
he
knew
that
the
rope
had
broken
and
he
had
fallen
into
the
stream
there
was
no
additional
strangulation
the
noose
about
his
neck
was
already
suffocating
him
and
kept
the
water
from
his
lungs
to
die
of
hanging
at
the
bottom
of
a
river--the
idea
seemed
to
him
ludicrous
he
opened
his
eyes
in
the
darkness
and
saw
above
him
a
gleam
of
light
but
how
distant
how
inaccessible
he
was
still
sinking
for
the
light
became
fainter
and
fainter
until
it
was
a
mere
glimmer
then
it
began
to
grow
and
brighten
and
he
knew
that
he
was
rising
toward
the
surface--knew
it
with
reluctance
for
he
was
now
very
comfortable
to
be
hanged
and
drowned
he
thought
that
is
not
so
bad
but
i
do
not
wish
to
be
shot
no
i
will
not
be
shot
that
is
not
fair
he
was
not
conscious
of
an
effort
but
a
sharp
pain
in
his
wrist
apprised
him
that
he
was
trying
to
free
his
hands
he
gave
the
struggle
his
attention
as
an
idler
might
observe
the
feat
of
a
juggler
without
interest
in
the
outcome
what
splendid
effort--what
magnificent
what
superhuman
strength
ah
that
was
a
fine
endeavor
bravo
the
cord
fell
away
his
arms
parted
and
floated
upward
the
hands
dimly
seen
on
each
side
in
the
growing
light
he
watched
them
with
a
new
interest
as
first
one
and
then
the
other
pounced
upon
the
noose
at
his
neck
they
tore
it
away
and
thrust
it
fiercely
aside
its
undulations
resembling
those
of
a
water
snake
put
it
back
put
it
back
he
thought
he
shouted
these
words
to
his
hands
for
the
undoing
of
the
noose
had
been
succeeded
by
the
direst
pang
that
he
had
yet
experienced
his
neck
ached
horribly
his
brain
was
on
fire
his
heart
which
had
been
fluttering
faintly
gave
a
great
leap
trying
to
force
itself
out
at
his
mouth
his
whole
body
was
racked
and
wrenched
with
an
insupportable
anguish
but
his
disobedient
hands
gave
no
heed
to
the
command
they
beat
the
water
vigorously
with
quick
downward
strokes
forcing
him
to
the
surface
he
felt
his
head
emerge
his
eyes
were
blinded
by
the
sunlight
his
chest
expanded
convulsively
and
with
a
supreme
and
crowning
agony
his
lungs
engulfed
a
great
draught
of
air
which
instantly
he
expelled
in
a
shriek
he
was
now
in
full
possession
of
his
physical
senses
they
were
indeed
preternaturally
keen
and
alert
something
in
the
awful
disturbance
of
his
organic
system
had
so
exalted
and
refined
them
that
they
made
record
of
things
never
before
perceived
he
felt
the
ripples
upon
his
face
and
heard
their
separate
sounds
as
they
struck
he
looked
at
the
forest
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
saw
the
individual
trees
the
leaves
and
the
veining
of
each
leaf--he
saw
the
very
insects
upon
them
the
locusts
the
brilliant
bodied
flies
the
gray
spiders
stretching
their
webs
from
twig
to
twig
he
noted
the
prismatic
colors
in
all
the
dewdrops
upon
a
million
blades
of
grass
the
humming
of
the
gnats
that
danced
above
the
eddies
of
the
stream
the
beating
of
the
dragon
flies'
wings
the
strokes
of
the
water
spiders'
legs
like
oars
which
had
lifted
their
boat--all
these
made
audible
music
a
fish
slid
along
beneath
his
eyes
and
he
heard
the
rush
of
its
body
parting
the
water
he
had
come
to
the
surface
facing
down
the
stream
in
a
moment
the
visible
world
seemed
to
wheel
slowly
round
himself
the
pivotal
point
and
he
saw
the
bridge
the
fort
the
soldiers
upon
the
bridge
the
captain
the
sergeant
the
two
privates
his
executioners
they
were
in
silhouette
against
the
blue
sky
they
shouted
and
gesticulated
pointing
at
him
the
captain
had
drawn
his
pistol
but
did
not
fire
the
others
were
unarmed
their
movements
were
grotesque
and
horrible
their
forms
gigantic
suddenly
he
heard
a
sharp
report
and
something
struck
the
water
smartly
within
a
few
inches
of
his
head
spattering
his
face
with
spray
he
heard
a
second
report
and
saw
one
of
the
sentinels
with
his
rifle
at
his
shoulder
a
light
cloud
of
blue
smoke
rising
from
the
muzzle
the
man
in
the
water
saw
the
eye
of
the
man
on
the
bridge
gazing
into
his
own
through
the
sights
of
the
rifle
he
observed
that
it
was
a
gray
eye
and
remembered
having
read
that
gray
eyes
were
keenest
and
that
all
famous
marksmen
had
them
nevertheless
this
one
had
missed
a
counter-swirl
had
caught
farquhar
and
turned
him
half
round
he
was
again
looking
at
the
forest
on
the
bank
opposite
the
fort
the
sound
of
a
clear
high
voice
in
a
monotonous
singsong
now
rang
out
behind
him
and
came
across
the
water
with
a
distinctness
that
pierced
and
subdued
all
other
sounds
even
the
beating
of
the
ripples
in
his
ears
although
no
soldier
he
had
frequented
camps
enough
to
know
the
dread
significance
of
that
deliberate
drawling
aspirated
chant
the
lieutenant
on
shore
was
taking
a
part
in
the
morning's
work
how
coldly
and
pitilessly--with
what
an
even
calm
intonation
presaging
and
enforcing
tranquility
in
the
men--with
what
accurately
measured
interval
fell
those
cruel
words
company

fire
farquhar
dived--dived
as
deeply
as
he
could
the
water
roared
in
his
ears
like
the
voice
of
niagara
yet
he
heard
the
dull
thunder
of
the
volley
and
rising
again
toward
the
surface
met
shining
bits
of
metal
singularly
flattened
oscillating
slowly
downward
some
of
them
touched
him
on
the
face
and
hands
then
fell
away
continuing
their
descent
one
lodged
between
his
collar
and
neck
it
was
uncomfortably
warm
and
he
snatched
it
out
as
he
rose
to
the
surface
gasping
for
breath
he
saw
that
he
had
been
a
long
time
under
water
he
was
perceptibly
farther
downstream--nearer
to
safety
the
soldiers
had
almost
finished
reloading
the
metal
ramrods
flashed
all
at
once
in
the
sunshine
as
they
were
drawn
from
the
barrels
turned
in
the
air
and
thrust
into
their
sockets
the
two
sentinels
fired
again
independently
and
ineffectually
the
hunted
man
saw
all
this
over
his
shoulder
he
was
now
swimming
vigorously
with
the
current
his
brain
was
as
energetic
as
his
arms
and
legs
he
thought
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
the
officer
he
reasoned
will
not
make
that
martinet's
error
a
second
time
it
is
as
easy
to
dodge
a
volley
as
a
single
shot
he
has
probably
already
given
the
command
to
fire
at
will
god
help
me
i
cannot
dodge
them
all
an
appalling
splash
within
two
yards
of
him
was
followed
by
a
loud
rushing
sound
diminuendo
which
seemed
to
travel
back
through
the
air
to
the
fort
and
died
in
an
explosion
which
stirred
the
very
river
to
its
deeps
a
rising
sheet
of
water
curved
over
him
fell
down
upon
him
blinded
him
strangled
him
the
cannon
had
taken
an
hand
in
the
game
as
he
shook
his
head
free
from
the
commotion
of
the
smitten
water
he
heard
the
deflected
shot
humming
through
the
air
ahead
and
in
an
instant
it
was
cracking
and
smashing
the
branches
in
the
forest
beyond
they
will
not
do
that
again
he
thought
the
next
time
they
will
use
a
charge
of
grape
i
must
keep
my
eye
upon
the
gun
the
smoke
will
apprise
me--the
report
arrives
too
late
it
lags
behind
the
missile
that
is
a
good
gun
suddenly
he
felt
himself
whirled
round
and
round--spinning
like
a
top
the
water
the
banks
the
forests
the
now
distant
bridge
fort
and
men
all
were
commingled
and
blurred
objects
were
represented
by
their
colors
only
circular
horizontal
streaks
of
color--that
was
all
he
saw
he
had
been
caught
in
a
vortex
and
was
being
whirled
on
with
a
velocity
of
advance
and
gyration
that
made
him
giddy
and
sick
in
few
moments
he
was
flung
upon
the
gravel
at
the
foot
of
the
left
bank
of
the
stream--the
southern
bank--and
behind
a
projecting
point
which
concealed
him
from
his
enemies
the
sudden
arrest
of
his
motion
the
abrasion
of
one
of
his
hands
on
the
gravel
restored
him
and
he
wept
with
delight
he
dug
his
fingers
into
the
sand
threw
it
over
himself
in
handfuls
and
audibly
blessed
it
it
looked
like
diamonds
rubies
emeralds
he
could
think
of
nothing
beautiful
which
it
did
not
resemble
the
trees
upon
the
bank
were
giant
garden
plants
he
noted
a
definite
order
in
their
arrangement
inhaled
the
fragrance
of
their
blooms
a
strange
roseate
light
shone
through
the
spaces
among
their
trunks
and
the
wind
made
in
their
branches
the
music
of
aeolian
harps
he
had
not
wish
to
perfect
his
escape--he
was
content
to
remain
in
that
enchanting
spot
until
retaken
a
whiz
and
a
rattle
of
grapeshot
among
the
branches
high
above
his
head
roused
him
from
his
dream
the
baffled
cannoneer
had
fired
him
a
random
farewell
he
sprang
to
his
feet
rushed
up
the
sloping
bank
and
plunged
into
the
forest
all
that
day
he
traveled
laying
his
course
by
the
rounding
sun
the
forest
seemed
interminable
nowhere
did
he
discover
a
break
in
it
not
even
a
woodman's
road
he
had
not
known
that
he
lived
in
so
wild
a
region
there
was
something
uncanny
in
the
revelation
by
nightfall
he
was
fatigued
footsore
famished
the
thought
of
his
wife
and
children
urged
him
on
at
last
he
found
a
road
which
led
him
in
what
he
knew
to
be
the
right
direction
it
was
as
wide
and
straight
as
a
city
street
yet
it
seemed
untraveled
no
fields
bordered
it
no
dwelling
anywhere
not
so
much
as
the
barking
of
a
dog
suggested
human
habitation
the
black
bodies
of
the
trees
formed
a
straight
wall
on
both
sides
terminating
on
the
horizon
in
a
point
like
a
diagram
in
a
lesson
in
perspective
overhead
as
he
looked
up
through
this
rift
in
the
wood
shone
great
golden
stars
looking
unfamiliar
and
grouped
in
strange
constellations
he
was
sure
they
were
arranged
in
some
order
which
had
a
secret
and
malign
significance
the
wood
on
either
side
was
full
of
singular
noises
among
which--once
twice
and
again--he
distinctly
heard
whispers
in
an
unknown
tongue
his
neck
was
in
pain
and
lifting
his
hand
to
it
found
it
horribly
swollen
he
knew
that
it
had
a
circle
of
black
where
the
rope
had
bruised
it
his
eyes
felt
congested
he
could
no
longer
close
them
his
tongue
was
swollen
with
thirst
he
relieved
its
fever
by
thrusting
it
forward
from
between
his
teeth
into
the
cold
air
how
softly
the
turf
had
carpeted
the
untraveled
avenue--he
could
no
longer
feel
the
roadway
beneath
his
feet
doubtless
despite
his
suffering
he
had
fallen
asleep
while
walking
for
now
he
sees
another
scene--perhaps
he
has
merely
recovered
from
a
delirium
he
stands
at
the
gate
of
his
own
home
all
is
as
he
left
it
and
all
bright
and
beautiful
in
the
morning
sunshine
he
must
have
traveled
the
entire
night
as
he
pushes
open
the
gate
and
passes
up
the
wide
white
walk
he
sees
a
flutter
of
female
garments
his
wife
looking
fresh
and
cool
and
sweet
steps
down
from
the
veranda
to
meet
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
she
stands
waiting
with
a
smile
of
ineffable
joy
an
attitude
of
matchless
grace
and
dignity
ah
how
beautiful
she
is
he
springs
forwards
with
extended
arms
as
he
is
about
to
clasp
her
he
feels
a
stunning
blow
upon
the
back
of
the
neck
a
blinding
white
light
blazes
all
about
him
with
a
sound
like
the
shock
of
a
cannon--then
all
is
darkness
and
silence
