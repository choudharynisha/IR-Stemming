it
all
started
with
a
dutchman
a
pennsylvania
dutchman
named
peter
scheinberger
who
tilled
a
weather
beaten
farm
back
in
the
hills
a
strong
wiry
man
he
was--his
arms
were
knotted
sections
of
solid
hickory
forming
themselves
into
gnarled
hands
and
twisted
stubs
of
fingers
his
furrowed
brow
dried
by
the
sun
and
cracked
in
a
million
places
by
the
wind
was
well
irrigated
by
long
rivulets
of
sweat
when
he
went
forth
in
the
fields
behind
his
horse
and
plow
it
wasn't
long
before
his
hair
was
plastered
down
firmly
to
his
scalp
the
salty
water
poured
out
of
the
deep
rings
in
his
ruddy
neck
and
ran
down
his
dark
brown
back
as
he
grew
older
the
skin
peeled
and
grew
loose
it
hung
on
him
in
folds
like
the
brittle
hide
of
a
rhino
it
seemed
that
the
more
years
he
spent
in
his
fields
behind
the
plow
horse
the
more
he
slipped
back
into
the
timeless
tradition
of
his
forefathers
he
was
a
proud
descendant
of
a
long
line
of
staunch
german
settlers
commonly
known
as
the
pennsylvania
dutch
he
grew
up
in
his
fundamental
religious
sect
having
never
known
any
other
environment
he
was
exposed
to
the
sun
soil
and
wind
from
the
early
days
of
his
childhood
and
along
with
the
elements
he
also
was
exposed
to
the
evils
of
the
hexerei
the
hexerei
or
witchcraft
was
something
that
was
never
doubted
or
scoffed
at
by
his
people
then
why
should
he
a
good
pennsylvania
dutchman
doubt
or
scoff
at
such
tradition
perhaps
had
he
moved
away
from
his
ancestral
lands
and
had
been
cultured
in
modern
communities
been
educated
and
raised
in
other
schools
he
might
have
matured
but
having
no
time
for
any
other
diversions
than
might
be
found
on
his
rustic
homestead
he
grew
up
behind
the
plow
horse
tramping
in
the
dark
stony
pasture
land
eking
out
his
meager
existence
from
the
black
fields
of
pennsylvania
now
peter's
life
could
have
gone
on
unnoticed
among
these
forgotten
hills
except
for
the
strange
visit
of
martin
g
mirestone
student
of
german
history
it
was
a
cold
night
when
peter
met
mirestone
peter
had
been
sitting
up
rather
late
pondering
over
an
old
yellowed
book
by
the
light
of
a
kerosene
lamp
the
pale
flame
flickered
about
the
walls
sending
shadows
scurrying
back
and
forth
creating
all
types
of
weird
shapes
and
designs
peter
huddled
over
the
withered
pages
every
now
and
then
glancing
up
at
the
walls
to
watch
the
fantastic
games
that
light
and
dark
were
playing
then
putting
his
book
aside
for
the
night
he
prepared
to
go
to
bed
he
went
over
to
the
window
to
draw
the
shutters
stopping
for
an
instant
to
peer
out
into
the
gloom
along
the
stony
path
that
ran
from
his
house
to
an
old
foot-bridge
about
fifty
feet
away
curling
up
from
the
gorge
mist
seemed
to
play
among
the
rotted
planks
it
rose
and
fell
in
great
billowing
blankets
sometimes
concealing
the
structure
from
view





peter
was
about
to
latch
the
shutter
and
leave
when
his
attention
was
focused
upon
a
figure
that
seemed
to
emerge
from
the
fog--sort
of
fading
in
from
nowhere
it
made
its
way
across
the
narrow
span
like
some
ghostly
apparition
the
mist
enveloped
his
legs
and
clouded
his
features
peter
drew
back
in
terror
for
the
mere
appearance
of
the
man
coming
out
of
the
darkness
was
enough
to
fill
his
infant
brain
with
visions
of
death
and
hexerei
as
the
figure
drew
closer
peter
saw
that
it
was
wearing
a
cloak
all
the
more
ghostly
it
appeared
with
the
cloak
sailing
behind
him
in
the
wind
like
some
devil's
banner
peter
just
stood
transfixed
as
he
watched
the
stranger
come
up
the
winding
road
to
his
house
slamming
the
shutter
he
hurriedly
fastened
it
and
then
turned
to
the
door
to
bolt
that
also
too
late
the
door
was
thrown
open
revealing
a
tall
man
clothed
in
black
his
face
was
wreathed
in
a
wide
grin--a
grin
that
seemed
to
make
fun
of
the
grayish
pallor
of
his
face
and
the
ominous
appearance
of
his
wild
garb
before
the
man
stepped
inside
peter
made
a
mental
image
of
the
scene
for
it
was
to
be
firmly
imbedded
in
his
mind
so
that
he
would
never
forget
the
slightest
detail
for
the
rest
of
his
life--the
wind
blowing
about
the
fierce
visage
tossing
up
the
long
strands
of
hair
the
massive
veined
hand
that
clutched
the
wrought
iron
thumb-latch
and
the
way
that
the
lamp
struck
his
face
highlighting
the
thin
ridged
nose
and
high
cheekbones
peter
scheinberger
heh
the
man
spoke
in
perfect
german
peter
scheinberger
the
last
of
your
clan
here
in
america
it
was
several
seconds
before
peter
could
muster
up
enough
courage
to
answer
him
drawing
back
slowly
he
braced
himself
against
the
table
and
in
a
thick
guttural
german
asked
who
are
you
the
stranger
shut
the
door
and
drew
the
bolt
he
crossed
the
room
and
with
an
air
of
one
who
was
accustomed
to
having
his
own
way
wherever
he
went
scanned
the
shelves
of
peter's
larder
with
a
practiced
eye
peter
watched
him
closely
as
he
drew
down
a
bottle
of
wine
broke
the
neck
against
a
beam
above
him
and
settled
down
in
peter's
easy
chair
he
poured
a
glass
full
and
shoved
it
across
the
table
towards
the
anxious
peter
and
then
poured
another
glass
for
himself
mirestone
the
stranger
finally
answered
martin
g
mirestone
then
draining
his
glass
he
added
student
of
german
history
all
this
was
beyond
peter's
comprehension
no
one
ever
had
the
audacity
to
walk
into
his
house
and
help
himself
to
whatever
he
wanted--he
was
indeed
unheard
of
in
his
tiny
social
world
well
what
are
you
staring
at
mirestone
boomed
out
take
my
cloak
please
then
be
seated
we'll
talk
taking
the
cloak
and
draping
it
over
a
wooden
peg
in
the
wall
peter
moved
cautiously
around
the
foreboding
character
that
monopolized
his
small
house
carefully
seating
himself
opposite
the
man
he
moved
the
table
so
that
it
set
between
them
as
a
protective
barrier
i'll
make
myself
clear
to
you
mirestone
explained
for
i
want
my
stay
to
be
as
brief
as
possible
he
poured
himself
another
glass
of
wine
then
settled
back
in
the
chair
half
closing
his
eyes
you
see
i
am
a
student
you
might
say
of
german
history
or
folklore
i
am
in
the
process
of
writing
a
collective
history
of
the
pennsylvania
dutch
folk
their
habits
beliefs
and--
he
broke
off
for
an
instant
as
he
leaned
forward
across
the
table
staring
into
the
frightened
eyes
of
peter
--and
their
superstitions
shifting
his
chair
around
in
order
to
get
benefit
from
the
heat
of
the
fireplace
mirestone
went
on
now
i
want
facts
scheinberger
authentic
facts
i
am
prepared
to
pay
you
well
for
your
trouble
but
i
insist
on
information
that
is
backed
up
with
sound
accurate
truth
peter
became
more
relaxed
but
still
slightly
uneasy
he
didn't
like
the
attitude
of
this
man
mirestone
he
was
too
sure
of
himself--altogether
too
cocky
but
then
on
the
other
hand
he
had
said
there
would
be
a
financial
gain
from
any
business
that
he
could
transact
with
him
money
was
something
that
peter
knew
he
needed
in
order
to
keep
his
farm
going
and
any
income
however
small
it
may
be
would
be
welcomed
gratefully
yes
he
decided
that
he
had
better
endure
the
rudeness
of
this
man
for
a
few
seconds
however
the
tall
stranger
seemed
to
lose
all
of
his
cockiness
and
a
somber
look
crept
over
his
jovial
features
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
hex
of
the
white
feather
peter
thought
a
moment
before
he
replied
yes
i
have
heard
of
it
then
nervously
he
fingered
his
glass
of
wine
that
he
had
not
as
yet
touched
raising
it
up
to
his
lips
he
sipped
it
slowly
as
he
stared
at
mirestone
over
the
rim
of
the
glass
yes
i
have
heard
of
it
he
repeated
good
good
you
have
heard
of
it
now
you
will
tell
me
about
it
of
course
i
want
to
know
all
about
it--how
it
is
practiced
the
results
and
so
forth
is
that
why
you
came
here
only
to
learn
of
the
white
feather
hex





mirestone
climbed
to
his
feet
and
paced
the
room
yes
he
said
peter
noted
a
sad
tone
in
his
voice
and
he
waited
for
him
to
say
more
yes
mirestone
continued
i
have
like
you
heard
of
the
hex
of
the
white
feather
i
have
traced
it
down
to
several
families
but
none
could
tell
me
anything
about
it
that
was
factual
half
of
the
stupid
fools
made
up
stories
as
they
went
along--some
concocting
the
biggest
bunch
of
asinine
tales
that
i've
ever
heard
but
you
peter
are
a
descendant
of
the
scheinbergers
i
know
for
a
fact
that
otto
scheinberger
practiced
the
white
feather
hex
and
passed
the
power
on
down
to
your
father
from
there
it
stopped
however
there
must
be
some
record
of
it
in
your
family
you
are
in
possession
of
the
books
of
your
grandfather
aren't
you
i
have
several
of
his
books
some
of
them
i
have
read
well
mirestone
waited
did
you
come
across
anything
about
the
hex
yes
answered
peter
i
read
about
that
which
you
mention
splendid
now
we
are
getting
somewhere
can
you
find
me
the
book
that
tells
of
it
peter
finished
drinking
his
wine
and
setting
the
glass
upon
the
table
he
slowly
rose
and
faced
mirestone
with
a
look
of
superiority
playing
about
his
rustic
features
no
i
am
afraid
not
you
see
i
have
burned
the
book
mirestone's
face
went
white
you
burned
it
yes
said
peter
i
don't
wish
to
have
anything
to
do
with
such
black
magic
it
is
better
burned
but
you
must
remember
the
hex
although
the
book
is
destroyed
you
still
have
the
information
in
your
head
nein
i
could
never
forget
it
if
i
wanted
to
replied
peter
reluctantly
if
i
could
burn
my
memory
also
it
would
be
better
mirestone
went
back
to
the
fireplace
and
placed
several
chunks
of
wood
on
the
blaze
a
bright
orange
glow
leaped
out
from
the
hearth
and
danced
mockingly
over
his
pallid
brow
hiding
his
lank
jowls
in
the
shadows
cast
by
the
cheekbones
like
some
grim
spectre
he
rose
up
towering
above
the
little
dutchman
peter
had
only
to
look
into
his
eyes
to
see
the
imperative
request
that
lingered
behind
the
hollowed
sockets





throughout
the
remainder
of
the
night
peter
almost
in
spite
of
himself
wracked
his
brain
to
bring
back
to
mind
everything
that
was
mentioned
in
the
book
about
the
hex
of
the
white
feather
the
idea
was
clear
enough
but
the
minute
details
the
infinite
possibilities
for
mistake
and
the
exacting
specifications
concerning
the
experiment
were
blurred
in
his
memory
he
knew
that
with
time
he
could
bring
back
everything
that
he
had
read
but
it
would
take
deep
concentration
and
perhaps
many
days
of
trial
and
error
to
determine
the
right
path
that
they
must
follow
in
order
to
have
success
mirestone
realizing
that
any
distraction
would
break
peter's
train
of
thought
sat
quietly
in
the
corner
finishing
off
the
dutchman's
supply
of
wine
he
watched
peter
closely
through
his
slitted
eyes
and
it
seemed
that
his
compelling
stare
was
the
only
force
that
could
drive
the
frightened
peter
on
every
so
often
peter
would
glance
up
and
see
mirestone
leaning
back
in
the
corner
half
concealed
by
the
deep
shadows--only
his
partially
opened
eyes
could
be
seen
flickering
in
the
fiery
glow
of
the
hearth
then
he
would
cover
his
face
with
his
large
knotted
hands
work
the
twisted
fingers
through
his
hair
and
try
to
bring
back
to
mind
the
evil
recipe
the
glow
from
the
fireplace
gradually
died
down
to
make
room
for
the
streams
of
morning
dawn
peter
blinked
sleepily
and
got
up
to
stretch
a
bit
outside
the
dull
morning
light
worked
its
way
over
peter's
farm--clouds
of
mist
still
poured
up
from
the
gorge
circling
the
bridge
and
creeping
up
the
bank
across
the
fields
peter
unlatched
the
heavy
oaken
door
and
went
outside
to
the
outbuildings
meanwhile
mirestone
had
started
a
fire
in
the
stove
and
was
placing
slabs
of
bacon
in
the
pan
nothing
like
a
good
old-fashioned
peasant's
breakfast
he
laughed
as
peter
came
in
the
door
several
minutes
later
so
you
brought
a
goat
heh
he
noticed
are
you
figuring
on
starting
in
soon
peter
set
a
small
kid
on
the
floor
and
watched
it
scamper
about
the
room
looking
for
an
exit
yes
we
might
as
well
i
don't
like
this
business
at
all
i
wish
to
get
it
over
with
as
soon
as
possible
and----
peter
eyed
mirestone
squarely
i
expect
to
be
paid
well
for
my
trouble
he
was
trying
to
make
himself
believe
that
that
was
his
only
reason
for
complying
with
mirestone's
demands
actually
he
was
not
so
sure





as
the
heat
of
the
noon
day
sun
blasted
down
on
their
backs
mirestone
watched
peter
pass
a
feather
freshly
plucked
from
a
white
leghorn
under
the
nose
of
the
bleating
kid
mirestone
listened
carefully
to
what
peter
was
telling
him
the
breath
of
the
victim
had
to
be
spread
over
the
feather
before
anything
further
could
be
done
tie
him
commanded
peter
mirestone
held
the
goat
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
and
fastened
a
halter
about
him
the
other
end
was
secured
to
a
stake
allowing
the
kid
to
run
about
in
a
circle
of
ten
feet
or
so
in
diameter
we
will
leave
him
for
awhile
said
peter
as
he
walked
back
to
the
kitchen
mirestone
followed
in
the
dutchman's
footsteps
and
when
they
were
inside
he
listened
intently
as
peter
recited
a
monosyllabic
chant
over
the
feather
the
chant
is
easy
enough
to
learn
peter
assured
him
you
will
master
it
quickly
i
understand
so
far
mirestone
said
then
that
is
all
peter
finished
except
that
you
can
hang
the
feather
up
and
watch
it
grow
red
red
yes
peter
explained
that
is
the
only
way
you
can
tell
if
the
hex
has
worked
peter
went
to
a
chest
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
and
drew
out
a
small
box
of
sewing
utensils
he
broke
off
a
piece
of
black
thread
and
replaced
the
box
in
the
chest
now
i'll
show
you
what
i
mean
peter
spoke
wearily
as
he
tied
the
feather
with
the
thread
and
suspended
it
from
one
of
the
rafters
in
the
room
just
sit
and
watch
it
was
not
many
minutes
before
a
light
red
tint
crept
up
the
feather's
quill
spreading
slowly
outwards
towards
the
fringed
edges
deeper
and
deeper
grew
the
intensity
of
the
color
until
it
reached
a
pure
blood
red
hurry
outside
cried
peter
you
can
see
the
goat
in
its
last
seconds
of
life
mirestone
hurried
after
the
dutchman
jerking
at
the
halter
the
goat
bleated
in
agony
prancing
up
and
down
frantically
its
eyes
grew
horribly
bloodshot
and
finally
closed
with
a
feeble
choking
sigh
the
animal
dropped
over
on
its
side
its
legs
still
twitching
spasmodically
mirestone
bent
over
the
hairy
form
and
examined
the
head
now
wet
with
perspiration
nothing
can
be
done
for
the
beast
no
peter
looked
on
with
a
touch
of
pity
in
his
eyes
nothing
can
be
done
once
the
feather
has
turned
red
as
if
the
death
of
the
kid
was
their
cue
masses
of
thick
thunderheads
turned
over
with
a
deep
rumbling
thunder
the
sky
became
crystal
clear
and
a
greenish
glow
could
be
seen
working
its
way
across
the
horizon
the
sky
darkened
as
the
glistening
thunderheads
now
taking
on
an
ominous
coloring
warned
the
farmers
of
the
impending
storm
it
was
later
that
evening
rain
drummed
against
the
slate
roof
of
peter's
house
and
reverberated
through
the
rooms
to
where
mirestone
and
the
dutchman
sat
by
the
fire
in
silence
mirestone
broke
the
still
atmosphere
by
putting
forth
a
question
that
peter
somehow
knew
would
be
coming
sooner
or
later
i
wonder
how
the
hex
would
react
on
a
human
being
peter
hoped
to
end
the
topic
by
answering
him
quickly
and
not
beating
around
the
bush
trying
to
evade
the
question
it
would
kill
him
eventually
maybe
not
so
quick
as
the
goat
but
it
would
kill
him
what
do
you
mean
not
as
quickly
as
the
goat--do
you
think
it
would
take
more
time
on
a
human
perhaps
i
have
heard
of
cases
in
which
the
hex
once
it
was
started
dragged
on
for
many
days
i
see
mirestone
sat
back
again
thinking
to
himself
peter
didn't
like
this
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
mirestone
well
you
have
your
information
i
showed
you
how
the
hex
works
so
why
not
pay
me
and
leave
mirestone
got
up
and
laughed
in
the
dutchman's
face
crossing
to
the
larder
he
brought
down
a
bottle
cracking
the
neck
on
the
beam
above
just
as
he
had
done
the
night
before
a
wave
of
apprehension
overcame
peter
as
he
realized
the
old
flip
attitude
of
mirestone's
was
coming
back
that
meant
definite
trouble
and
peter
began
to
fear
the
consequences
so
why
not
pay
me
and
leave
he
again
ventured
or
do
you
want
something
else
peter
knew
that
he
didn't
need
to
ask
that
last
question
for
already
he
realized
the
grim
experiment
that
was
playing
about
in
mirestone's
head
yes
i
just
told
you
what
i
wanted
i
want
to
see
the
hex
on
a
human
before
i
go
why
you
have
your
information
why
do
you
want
to
see
it
work
on
a
man
my
stupid
little
peasant
friend
do
i
look
like
a
student
of
history
for
the
first
time
peter
actually
looked
at
mirestone
and
saw
him
for
what
he
was
of
course
he
couldn't
be
a
student
no
student
would
act
as
he
did
or
even
look
as
he
did
the
words
jammed
in
his
throat
as
he
was
about
to
voice
a
reply
ha--martin
g
mirestone
student
of
history
student
of
german
history
no
my
little
oxen
friend
i
am
no
more
a
student
of
history
than
you
are
but
i
need
the
hex
for
other
reasons
which
do
not
concern
you
then
as
if
he
were
contemplating
a
great
new
joke
he
continued
but
on
the
other
hand
maybe
the
future
of
the
white
feather
hex
does
concern
you
mirestone's
voice
was
drowned
out
by
a
heavy
rumbling
of
thunder
and
the
increased
splashing
of
rain
on
the
windows
but
somehow
peter
seemed
not
to
notice





somewhat
later
mirestone
stepped
quietly
over
to
the
sleeping
form
of
his
host
peter
had
been
over
twenty-four
hours
now
without
sleep
and
although
the
old
dutchman
had
tried
desperately
to
fight
off
the
drowsiness
that
overcame
him
the
recent
excitement
of
the
day
had
finally
taken
its
toll
lightning
struck
near
by
followed
with
an
ear
splitting
blast
that
shook
the
house
to
its
rocky
foundations
pieces
of
slate
flew
off
the
roof
and
were
carried
away
into
the
night
the
rain
poured
down
in
a
great
deluge
blurring
the
window
making
it
impossible
to
see
in
or
out
mirestone
held
out
a
glistening
white
feather
in
his
long
spidery
fingers
he
placed
it
within
a
few
inches
of
peter's
nose
and
watched
the
delicate
edges
riffle
in
the
dutchman's
breath
crossing
to
the
table
he
leaned
over
the
white
fluff
and
breathed
the
short
german
incantation
over
it
how
it
glistened
in
the
firelight
he
bent
closer
and
closer
as
he
whispered
the
magic
words
that
peter
had
taught
him
his
breath
ruffling
the
feather
playing
about
in
the
fringed
softness
he
hung
up
the
feather
by
a
thread
and
watched
it
hop
back
and
forth
in
the
center
of
the
room





peter
awakened
and
saw
mirestone
sitting
by
the
fire
noting
every
movement
of
the
feather
what
are
you
doing
heh
mirestone
swung
around
and
glared
at
the
bleary
eyed
dutchman
sit
down
he
commanded
sit
down
and
watch
the
feather
turn
red
peter
didn't
need
to
be
told
that
it
was
his
feather
he
knew
by
the
merciless
eyes
of
mirestone
that
everything
was
over
so
you
were
determined
to
find
out
what
would
happen
if
the
hex
were
tried
on
a
man
peter
was
surprised
at
how
easily
he
took
his
fate
there
was
no
need
of
excitement--this
was
his
end
and
there
was
no
changing
it
yes
i
had
to
know
for
i
can't
leave
until
i
have
a
complete
record
of
all
the
results
mirestone
certainly
was
not
cocky
now
he
looked
almost
ashamed
of
himself
as
he
sat
there
nervously
watching
a
man's
fate
swing
by
a
silken
thread
i'm
sorry
peter
my
friend
but
that
is
how
it
must
be
you
are
a
stepping
stone
to
a
glorious
reckoning
that
will
soon
take
place
the
hex
of
the
white
feather--i
can
hardly
believe
that
i
have
at
last
tracked
it
down
and
you
peter
are
the
last
witness
the
last
link
in
the
chain
of
those
who
know
the
secret
and
how
can
it
better
end
than
by
your
becoming
a
part
of
the
secret
peter
realized
that
he
had
not
much
longer
to
live
and
nothing
he
could
do
to
mirestone
would
change
his
fate
perhaps
he
could
save
others
though
what
is
this
glorious
reckoning
you
were
speaking
about
as
soon
as
i
see
how
your
case
ends
i'll
be
able
to
go
ahead
and
release
my
vengeance
on
those
stupid
bungling
fools
who
have
thwarted
my
progress
in
the
black
arts
they
claim
to
speak
in
the
name
of
humanity
no
less
in
that
case
exclaimed
peter
i
won't
let
myself
be
a
foothold
for
your
damned
work--it
is
of
the
devil
and
i'll
have
no
part
of
it
shut
up
fool
you
are
a
part
of
it
already
not
if
my
body
is
destroyed
before
you
can
get
hold
of
it
peter
played
his
trump
card
he
quickly
sprang
back
and
slipped
out
the
door
into
the
storm
mirestone
jumped
up
after
him
but
it
was
too
late
he
peered
out
into
the
raging
tempest
making
out
the
figure
of
peter
struggling
with
the
hatch
on
the
horse
barn
he
pulled
his
cloak
about
him
and
started
towards
peter
to
stop
him
the
rain
beat
his
face
blinding
him
momentarily
and
before
he
could
see
clearly
a
dark
mass
pounded
by
swift
hoofs
spattering
mud
all
over
him
down
the
road
sped
peter
on
the
horse--down
the
road
and
towards
the
foot-bridge
mirestone
ran
a
few
steps
and
halted
he
heard
the
hollow
staccato
of
horse's
hoofs
on
the
planks
for
an
instant
followed
by
a
splintering
crash
that
rumbled
up
from
the
gorge
a
long
guttural
cry
pierced
the
black
gloom
as
man
and
horse
plunged
down
to
the
seething
death
awaiting
them
cursing
savagely
milestone
trudged
back
through
the
rain
to
the
house
he
slammed
the
door
shut
and
threw
his
cloak
on
peter's
bed
there
was
one
more
bottle
on
the
shelf
he
smashed
the
neck
and
poured
a
glass
if
one
could
see
him
bent
over
the
table
sending
silent
curses
into
his
wine
he
could
readily
imagine
the
feeling
of
defeat
that
had
spread
over
mirestone's
countenance
the
idiot
of
a
dutchman
who
had
to
play
the
hero's
part
and
save
other
lives
by
ending
his
own
made
mirestone
fairly
sick
however
all
was
not
over
so
the
dutchman
had
died
the
hex
had
worked--a
lot
sooner
than
he
had
expected
though
now
he
certainly
would
be
delayed
in
his
progress
for
he
had
counted
on
examining
the
body
for
any
traces
left
that
would
suggest
something
out
of
the
ordinary
one
thing
however
he
had
learned
was
that
the
hex
at
least
worked
on
humans
the
mangled
body
that
was
being
washed
over
the
rocks
would
be
enough
proof
on
that
score
mirestone
poured
another
drink
he
leaned
back
in
the
chair
and
placed
the
glass
to
his
lips
he
was
tilted
so
far
back
that
as
he
raised
the
wine
to
a
drinking
position
it
blocked
his
view
of
the
room
as
he
slowly
sipped
it
however
the
room
began
to
come
into
view--the
ceiling
first
and
slowly
the
wall
his
eyes
focused
on
a
piece
of
thread
hanging
from
the
ceiling
and
as
the
wine
sank
lower
and
lower
in
the
glass
the
thread
grew
longer
and
longer
until
in
one
last
swallow
he
was
able
to
see
the
end
of
the
line
mirestone's
hand
went
stiff
as
he
looked
at
the
thread
for
on
the
end
of
it
was
a
pure
white
feather





in
an
instant
mirestone
realized
that
the
hex
had
not
worked
peter's
death
at
the
bridge
had
been
a
grotesque
coincidence
had
the
untimely
plunge
in
the
rapids
been
the
result
of
the
hex
the
feather
would
have
long
since
been
red
therefore
the
tragedy
was
no
more
than
an
accident
and
mirestone's
hands
were
innocent
of
the
dutchman's
blood
that
realization
of
course
didn't
bother
him
for
he
was
not
concerned
whether
or
not
he
was
responsible
for
peter's
death
but
he
was
genuinely
worried
in
the
failure
of
the
hex
he
wondered
if
he
had
done
something
wrong
if
he
had
the
last
link
that
could
have
corrected
him
was
broken
from
here
on
in
he
was
on
his
own
he
calmed
himself
and
began
to
think
he
retraced
everything
that
he
had
done
to
see
if
he
couldn't
have
found
some
margin
in
which
error
could
have
crept
in
he
remembered
how
carefully
he
had
bent
over
the
feather
reciting
the
exact
words
taught
him
by
peter
he
especially
remembered
that
part
of
the
hex
for
hadn't
the
feather
been
ruffled
by
his
breath
when
he
spoke
gradually
the
truth
began
to
dawn
on
mirestone
his
own
breath
must
have
released
peter
from
the
hex
the
last
person's
breath
that
touched
the
feather
would
feel
the
sting
of
the
power
mirestone
sat
back
dumbfounded
he
was
to
be
his
own
guinea
pig
what
ghastly
horror
was
he
in
for
would
he
die
quickly
like
the
goat
or
would
his
death
be
prolonged
over
a
period
of
days
like
peter
had
suggested
he
gripped
himself
it
wouldn't
do
to
lose
control
of
his
senses
there
must
be
a
way
out
of
the
predicament
but
peter
said
that
as
soon
as
the
feather
turned
red
there
was
no
turning
back
ah--there's
the
answer
the
feather
is
still
white

there's
still
a
chance
mirestone
grabbed
his
cloak
and
raced
for
the
door
he
must
get
an
animal--another
goat
perhaps
and
expose
the
feather
to
its
breath
he
must
hurry
lest
the
spell
will
start
working
the
slippery
mud
dragged
him
back
and
impeded
his
progress
but
he
struggled
on
through
the
blinding
storm
towards
the
barn
it
was
so
black
outside
that
he
could
hardly
make
out
the
buildings
all
at
once
he
saw
the
barn
looming
ahead
of
him
which
door
every
second
counted
he
would
try
the
first
one
he
came
to
wait--what's
this
holding
his
cloak
mirestone
turned
and
fumbled
with
some
barbed
wire
fencing
it
had
snagged
him
in
the
dark
and
he
soon
became
hopelessly
entangled
in
it
crying
and
shrieking
he
tore
the
cloak
from
his
shoulders
and
ran
on
in
his
shirt
sleeves
he
wrenched
open
a
door
and
sprawled
in
the
barn
head
first
on
his
hands
and
knees
he
scurried
across
the
mealy
floor
to
the
goat
stall
the
kids
sprang
in
terror
as
he
lurched
in
drunkenly
grabbing
about
in
the
dark
for
one
of
them
catching
one
by
the
hind
leg
he
groped
his
way
out
again
thrusting
his
shoulders
forward
he
slid
through
the
gripping
mud
tearing
his
way
through
the
engulfing
rain
with
his
free
hand
his
leg
left
numb
from
the
wound
inflicted
by
the
barbed
wire
and
a
trickle
of
blood
was
running
down
his
shins
without
thinking
he
reached
down
to
rub
the
wound
but
quickly
yanked
his
hand
up
again
what
was
that
horrible
sensation
he
felt
as
he
passed
his
hand
over
the
fleshy
sore
he
couldn't
see
in
the
rain
but
his
leg
told
him
that
it
was
something
hairy
almost
bristly
he
ran
on
towards
the
house
stumbling
in
the
treacherous
mud
once
he
fell
completely
down
in
the
slime
wiping
the
dripping
earth
from
his
face
he
was
told
again
that
something
was
wrong
his
cheeks
verified
his
shin's
story
of
a
rough
jagged
caress
holding
his
hand
in
front
of
his
face
he
saw
amidst
a
flash
of
lightning
a
curling
black
claw
bristling
with
long
ragged
hairs
screaming
hysterically
he
dropped
the
kid
and
fell
forward
into
the
door
of
the
house
the
latch
gave
way
with
his
weight
and
he
tumbled
into
the
cottage
dancing
madly
on
the
end
of
a
thread
was
a
blood
red
feather
end
