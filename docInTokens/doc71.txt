this
is
a
tale
of
iceland
the
isle
of
stories
and
of
a
thing
that
befell
in
the
year
of
the
coming
there
of
christianity
in
the
spring
of
that
year
a
ship
sailed
from
the
south
isles
to
traffic
and
fell
becalmed
inside
snowfellness
the
winds
had
speeded
her
she
was
the
first
comer
of
the
year
and
the
fishers
drew
alongside
to
hear
the
news
of
the
south
and
eager
folk
put
out
in
boats
to
see
the
merchandise
and
make
prices
from
the
doors
of
the
hall
on
frodis
water
the
house
folk
saw
the
ship
becalmed
and
the
boats
about
her
coming
and
going
and
the
merchants
from
the
ship
could
see
the
smoke
go
up
and
the
men
and
women
trooping
to
their
meals
in
the
hall
the
goodman
of
that
house
was
called
finnward
keelfarer
and
his
wife
aud
the
light-minded
and
they
had
a
son
eyolf
a
likely
boy
and
a
daughter
asdis
a
slip
of
a
maid
finnward
was
well-to-do
in
his
affairs
he
kept
open
house
and
had
good
friends
but
aud
his
wife
was
not
so
much
considered
her
mind
was
set
on
trifles
on
bright
clothing
and
the
admiration
of
men
and
the
envy
of
women
and
it
was
thought
she
was
not
always
so
circumspect
in
her
bearing
as
she
might
have
been
but
nothing
to
hurt
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
men
came
to
the
house
from
sea
they
told
of
the
merchandise
in
the
ship
which
was
well
enough
and
to
be
had
at
easy
rates
and
of
a
waif
woman
that
sailed
in
her
no
one
could
tell
why
and
had
chests
of
clothes
beyond
comparison
fine
coloured
stuffs
finely
woven
the
best
that
ever
came
into
that
island
and
gewgaws
for
a
queen
at
the
hearing
of
that
aud's
eyes
began
to
glisten
she
went
early
to
bed
and
the
day
was
not
yet
red
before
she
was
on
the
beach
had
a
boat
launched
and
was
pulling
to
the
ship
by
the
way
she
looked
closely
at
all
boats
but
there
was
no
woman
in
any
and
at
that
she
was
better
pleased
for
she
had
no
fear
of
the
men
when
they
came
to
the
ship
boats
were
there
already
and
the
merchants
and
the
shore
folk
sat
and
jested
and
chaffered
in
the
stern
but
in
the
fore
part
of
the
ship
the
woman
sat
alone
and
looked
before
her
sourly
at
the
sea
they
called
her
thorgunna
she
was
as
tall
as
a
man
and
high
in
flesh
a
buxom
wife
to
look
at
her
hair
was
of
the
dark
red
time
had
not
changed
it
her
face
was
dark
the
cheeks
full
and
the
brow
smooth
some
of
the
merchants
told
that
she
was
sixty
years
of
age
and
others
laughed
and
said
she
was
but
forty
but
they
spoke
of
her
in
whispers
for
they
seemed
to
think
that
she
was
ill
to
deal
with
and
not
more
than
ordinary
canny
aud
went
to
where
she
sat
and
made
her
welcome
to
iceland
thorgunna
did
the
honours
of
the
ship
so
for
a
while
they
carried
it
on
praising
and
watching
each
other
in
the
way
of
women
but
aud
was
a
little
vessel
to
contain
a
great
longing
and
presently
the
cry
of
her
heart
came
out
of
her
the
folk
say
says
she
you
have
the
finest
women's
things
that
ever
came
to
iceland
and
as
she
spoke
her
eyes
grew
big
it
would
be
strange
if
i
had
not
quoth
thorgunna
queens
have
no
finer
so
aud
begged
that
she
might
see
them
thorgunna
looked
on
her
askance
truly
said
she
the
things
are
for
no
use
but
to
be
shown
so
she
fetched
a
chest
and
opened
it
here
was
a
cloak
of
the
rare
scarlet
laid
upon
with
silver
beautiful
beyond
belief
hard
by
was
a
silver
brooch
of
basket
work
that
was
wrought
as
fine
as
any
shell
and
was
as
broad
as
the
face
of
the
full
moon
and
aud
saw
the
clothes
lying
folded
in
the
chest
of
all
the
colours
of
the
day
and
fire
and
precious
gems
and
her
heart
burned
with
envy
so
because
she
had
so
huge
a
mind
to
buy
she
began
to
make
light
of
the
merchandise
they
are
good
enough
things
says
she
though
i
have
better
in
my
chest
at
home
it
is
a
good
enough
cloak
and
i
am
in
need
of
a
new
cloak
at
that
she
fingered
the
scarlet
and
the
touch
of
the
fine
stuff
went
to
her
mind
like
singing
come
says
she
if
it
were
only
for
your
civility
in
showing
it
what
will
you
have
for
your
cloak
woman
said
thorgunna
i
am
no
merchant
and
she
closed
the
chest
and
locked
it
like
one
angry
then
aud
fell
to
protesting
and
caressing
her
that
was
aud's
practice
for
she
thought
if
she
hugged
and
kissed
a
person
none
could
say
her
nay
next
she
went
to
flattery
said
she
knew
the
things
were
too
noble
for
the
like
of
her--they
were
made
for
a
stately
beautiful
woman
like
thorgunna
and
at
that
she
kissed
her
again
and
thorgunna
seemed
a
little
pleased
and
now
aud
pled
poverty
and
begged
for
the
cloak
in
a
gift
and
now
she
vaunted
the
wealth
of
her
goodman
and
offered
ounces
and
ounces
of
fine
silver
the
price
of
three
men's
lives
thorgunna
smiled
but
it
was
a
grim
smile
and
still
she
shook
her
head
at
last
aud
wrought
herself
into
extremity
and
wept
i
would
give
my
soul
for
it
she
cried
fool
said
thorgunna
but
there
have
been
fools
before
you
and
a
little
after
she
said
this
let
us
be
done
with
beseeching
the
things
are
mine
i
was
a
fool
to
show
you
them
but
where
is
their
use
unless
we
show
them
mine
they
are
and
mine
they
shall
be
till
i
die
i
have
paid
for
them
dear
enough
said
she
aud
saw
it
was
of
no
avail
so
she
dried
her
tears
and
asked
thorgunna
about
her
voyage
and
made
believe
to
listen
while
she
plotted
in
her
little
mind
thorgunna
she
asked
presently
do
you
count
kin
with
any
folk
in
iceland
i
count
kin
with
none
replied
thorgunna
my
kin
is
of
the
greatest
but
i
have
not
been
always
lucky
so
i
say
the
less
so
that
you
have
no
house
to
pass
the
time
in
till
the
ship
return
cries
aud
dear
thorgunna
you
must
come
and
live
with
us
my
goodman
is
rich
his
hand
and
his
house
are
open
and
i
will
cherish
you
like
a
daughter
at
that
thorgunna
smiled
on
the
one
side
but
her
soul
laughed
within
her
at
the
woman's
shallowness
i
will
pay
her
for
that
word
daughter
she
thought
and
she
smiled
again
i
will
live
with
you
gladly
says
she
for
your
house
has
a
good
name
and
i
have
seen
the
smoke
of
your
kitchen
from
the
ship
but
one
thing
you
shall
understand
i
make
no
presents
i
give
nothing
where
i
go--not
a
rag
and
not
an
ounce
where
i
stay
i
work
for
my
upkeep
and
as
i
am
strong
as
a
man
and
hardy
as
an
ox
they
that
have
had
the
keeping
of
me
were
the
better
pleased
it
was
a
hard
job
for
aud
to
keep
her
countenance
for
she
was
like
to
have
wept
and
yet
she
felt
it
would
be
unseemly
to
eat
her
invitation
and
like
a
shallow
woman
and
one
that
had
always
led
her
husband
by
the
nose
she
told
herself
she
would
find
some
means
to
cajole
thorgunna
and
come
by
her
purpose
after
all
so
she
put
a
good
face
on
the
thing
had
thorgunna
into
the
boat
her
and
her
two
great
chests
and
brought
her
home
with
her
to
the
hall
by
the
beach
all
the
way
in
she
made
much
of
the
wife
and
when
they
were
arrived
gave
her
a
locked
bed-place
in
the
hall
where
was
a
bed
a
table
and
a
stool
and
space
for
the
two
chests
this
shall
be
yours
while
you
stay
here
said
aud
and
she
attended
on
her
guest
now
thorgunna
opened
the
second
chest
and
took
out
her
bedding--sheets
of
english
linen
the
like
of
it
never
seen
a
cover
of
quilted
silk
and
curtains
of
purple
wrought
with
silver
at
the
sight
of
these
aud
was
like
one
distracted
greed
blinded
her
mind
the
cry
rose
strong
in
her
throat
it
must
out
what
will
you
sell
your
bedding
for
she
cried
and
her
cheeks
were
hot
thorgunna
looked
upon
her
with
a
dusky
countenance
truly
you
are
a
courteous
hostess
said
she
but
i
will
not
sleep
on
straw
for
your
amusement
at
that
aud's
two
ears
grew
hot
as
her
cheeks
and
she
took
thorgunna
at
her
word
and
left
her
from
that
time
in
peace
the
woman
was
as
good
as
her
spoken
word
inside
the
house
and
out
she
wrought
like
three
and
all
that
she
put
her
hand
to
was
well
done
when
she
milked
the
cows
yielded
beyond
custom
when
she
made
hay
it
was
always
dry
weather
when
she
took
her
turn
at
the
cooking
the
folk
licked
their
spoons
her
manners
when
she
pleased
were
outside
imitation
like
one
that
had
sat
with
kings
in
their
high
buildings
it
seemed
she
was
pious
too
and
the
day
never
passed
but
she
was
in
the
church
there
praying
the
rest
was
not
so
well
she
was
of
few
words
and
never
one
about
her
kin
and
fortunes
gloom
sat
on
her
brow
and
she
was
ill
to
cross
behind
her
back
they
gave
her
the
name
of
the
waif
woman
or
the
wind
wife
to
her
face
it
must
always
be
thorgunna
and
if
any
of
the
young
men
called
her
mother
she
would
speak
no
more
that
day
but
sit
apart
in
the
hall
and
mutter
with
her
lips
this
is
a
queer
piece
of
goods
that
we
have
gotten
says
finnward
keelfarer
i
wish
we
get
no
harm
by
her
but
the
good
wife's
pleasure
must
be
done
said
he
which
was
his
common
word
when
she
was
at
work
thorgunna
wore
the
rudest
of
plain
clothes
though
ever
clean
as
a
cat
but
at
night
in
the
hall
she
was
more
dainty
for
she
loved
to
be
admired
no
doubt
she
made
herself
look
well
and
many
thought
she
was
a
comely
woman
still
and
to
those
she
was
always
favourable
and
full
of
pleasant
speech
but
the
more
that
some
pleased
her
it
was
thought
by
good
judges
that
they
pleased
aud
the
less
when
midsummer
was
past
a
company
of
young
men
upon
a
journey
came
to
the
house
by
frodis
water
that
was
always
a
great
day
for
aud
when
there
were
gallants
at
table
and
what
made
this
day
the
greater
alf
of
the
fells
was
in
the
company
and
she
thought
alf
fancied
her
so
be
sure
aud
wore
her
best
but
when
thorgunna
came
from
the
bed-place
she
was
arrayed
like
any
queen
and
the
broad
brooch
was
in
her
bosom
all
night
in
the
hall
these
women
strove
with
each
other
and
the
little
maid
asdis
looked
on
and
was
ashamed
and
knew
not
why
but
thorgunna
pleased
beyond
all
she
told
of
strange
things
that
had
befallen
in
the
world
when
she
pleased
she
had
the
cue
to
laughter
she
sang
and
her
voice
was
full
and
her
songs
new
in
that
island
and
whenever
she
turned
the
eyes
shone
in
her
face
and
the
brooch
glittered
at
her
bosom
so
that
the
young
men
forgot
the
word
of
the
merchants
as
to
the
woman's
age
and
their
looks
followed
her
all
night
aud
was
sick
with
envy
sleep
fled
her
her
husband
slept
but
she
sat
upright
beside
him
in
the
bed
and
gnawed
her
fingers
now
she
began
to
hate
thorgunna
and
the
glittering
of
the
great
brooch
stood
before
her
in
the
dark
sure
she
thought
it
must
be
the
glamour
of
that
brooch
she
is
not
so
fair
as
i
she
is
as
old
as
the
dead
in
the
hillside
and
as
for
her
wit
and
her
songs
it
is
little
i
think
of
them
up
she
got
at
that
took
a
light
from
the
embers
and
came
to
her
guest's
bed-place
the
door
was
locked
but
aud
had
a
master-key
and
could
go
in
inside
the
chests
were
open
and
in
the
top
of
one
the
light
of
her
taper
shone
upon
the
glittering
of
the
brooch
as
a
dog
snatches
food
she
snatched
it
and
turned
to
the
bed
thorgunna
lay
on
her
side
it
was
to
be
thought
she
slept
but
she
talked
the
while
to
herself
and
her
lips
moved
it
seemed
her
years
returned
to
her
in
slumber
for
her
face
was
grey
and
her
brow
knotted
and
the
open
eyes
of
her
stared
in
the
eyes
of
aud
the
heart
of
the
foolish
woman
died
in
her
bosom
but
her
greed
was
the
stronger
and
she
fled
with
that
which
she
had
stolen
when
she
was
back
in
bed
the
word
of
thorgunna
came
to
her
mind
that
these
things
were
for
no
use
but
to
be
shown
here
she
had
the
brooch
and
the
shame
of
it
and
might
not
wear
it
so
all
night
she
quaked
with
the
fear
of
discovery
and
wept
tears
of
rage
that
she
should
have
sinned
in
vain
day
came
and
aud
must
rise
but
she
went
about
the
house
like
a
crazy
woman
she
saw
the
eyes
of
asdis
rest
on
her
strangely
and
at
that
she
beat
the
maid
she
scolded
the
house
folk
and
by
her
way
of
it
nothing
was
done
aright
first
she
was
loving
to
her
husband
and
made
much
of
him
thinking
to
be
on
his
good
side
when
trouble
came
then
she
took
a
better
way
picked
a
feud
with
him
and
railed
on
the
poor
man
till
his
ears
rang
so
that
he
might
be
in
the
wrong
beforehand
the
brooch
she
hid
without
in
the
side
of
a
hayrick
all
this
while
thorgunna
lay
in
the
bed-place
which
was
not
her
way
for
by
custom
she
was
early
astir
at
last
she
came
forth
and
there
was
that
in
her
face
that
made
all
the
house
look
one
at
the
other
and
the
heart
of
aud
to
be
straitened
never
a
word
the
guest
spoke
not
a
bite
she
swallowed
and
they
saw
the
strong
shudderings
take
and
shake
her
in
her
place
yet
a
little
and
still
without
speech
back
she
went
into
her
bad-place
and
the
door
was
shut
that
is
a
sick
wife
said
finnward
her
weird
has
come
on
her
and
at
that
the
heart
of
aud
was
lifted
up
with
hope
all
day
thorgunna
lay
on
her
bed
and
the
next
day
sent
for
finnward
finnward
keelfarer
said
she
my
trouble
is
come
upon
me
and
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
days
he
made
the
customary
talk
i
have
had
my
good
things
now
my
hour
is
come
and
let
suffice
quoth
she
i
did
not
send
for
you
to
hear
your
prating
finnward
knew
not
what
to
answer
for
he
saw
her
soul
was
dark
i
sent
for
you
on
needful
matters
she
began
again
i
die
here--i--in
this
black
house
in
a
bleak
island
far
from
all
decency
and
proper
ways
of
man
and
now
my
treasure
must
be
left
small
pleasure
have
i
had
of
it
and
leave
it
with
the
less
cried
she
good
woman
as
the
saying
is
needs
must
says
finnward
for
he
was
nettled
with
that
speech
for
that
i
called
you
quoth
thorgunna
in
these
two
chests
are
much
wealth
and
things
greatly
to
be
desired
i
wish
my
body
to
be
laid
in
skalaholt
in
the
new
church
where
i
trust
to
hear
the
mass-priests
singing
over
my
head
so
long
as
time
endures
to
that
church
i
will
you
to
give
what
is
sufficient
leaving
your
conscience
judge
of
it
my
scarlet
cloak
with
the
silver
i
will
to
that
poor
fool
your
wife
she
longed
for
it
so
bitterly
i
may
not
even
now
deny
her
give
her
the
brooch
as
well
i
warn
you
of
her
i
was
such
as
she
only
wiser
i
warn
you
the
ground
she
stands
upon
is
water
and
whoso
trusts
her
leans
on
rottenness
i
hate
her
and
i
pity
her
when
she
comes
to
lie
where
i
lie--
there
she
broke
off
the
rest
of
my
goods
i
leave
to
your
black-
eyed
maid
young
asdis
for
her
slim
body
and
clean
mind
only
the
things
of
my
bed
you
shall
see
burned
it
is
well
said
finnward
it
may
be
well
quoth
she
if
you
obey
my
life
has
been
a
wonder
to
all
and
a
fear
to
many
while
i
lived
none
thwarted
me
and
prospered
see
to
it
that
none
thwart
me
after
i
am
dead
it
stands
upon
your
safety
it
stands
upon
my
honour
quoth
finnward
and
i
have
the
name
of
an
honourable
man
you
have
the
name
of
a
weak
one
says
thorgunna
look
to
it
look
to
it
finnward
your
house
shall
rue
it
else
the
rooftree
of
my
house
is
my
word
said
finnward
and
that
is
a
true
saying
says
the
woman
see
to
it
then
the
speech
of
thorgunna
is
ended
with
that
she
turned
her
face
against
the
wall
and
finnward
left
her
the
same
night
in
the
small
hours
of
the
clock
thorgunna
passed
it
was
a
wild
night
for
summer
and
the
wind
sang
about
the
eaves
and
clouds
covered
the
moon
when
the
dark
woman
wended
from
that
day
to
this
no
man
has
learned
her
story
or
her
people's
name
but
be
sure
the
one
was
stormy
and
the
other
great
she
had
come
to
that
isle
a
waif
woman
on
a
ship
thence
she
flitted
and
no
more
remained
of
her
but
her
heavy
chests
and
her
big
body
in
the
morning
the
house
women
streaked
and
dressed
the
corpse
then
came
finnward
and
carried
the
sheets
and
curtains
from
the
house
and
caused
build
a
fire
upon
the
sands
but
aud
had
an
eye
on
her
man's
doings
and
what
is
this
that
you
are
at
said
she
so
he
told
her
burn
the
good
sheets
she
cried
and
where
would
i
be
with
my
two
hands
no
troth
said
aud
not
so
long
as
your
wife
is
above
ground
good
wife
said
finnward
this
is
beyond
your
province
here
is
my
word
pledged
and
the
woman
dead
i
pledged
it
to
so
much
the
more
am
i
bound
let
me
be
doing
as
i
must
goodwife
tilly-valley
says
she
and
a
fiddlestick's
end
goodman
you
may
know
well
about
fishing
and
be
good
at
shearing
sheep
for
what
i
know
but
you
are
little
of
a
judge
of
damask
sheets
and
the
best
word
i
can
say
is
just
this
she
says
laying
hold
of
one
end
of
the
goods
that
if
ye
are
made
up
to
burn
the
plenishing
you
must
burn
your
wife
along
with
it
i
trust
it
will
not
go
so
hard
says
finnward
and
i
beg
you
not
to
speak
so
loud
and
let
the
house
folk
hear
you
let
them
speak
low
that
are
ashamed
cries
aud
i
speak
only
in
reason
you
are
to
consider
that
the
woman
died
in
my
house
says
finnward
and
this
was
her
last
behest
in
truth
goodwife
if
i
were
to
fail
it
is
a
thing
that
would
stick
long
in
my
throat
and
would
give
us
an
ill
name
with
the
neighbours
and
you
are
to
consider
says
she
that
i
am
your
true
wife
and
worth
all
the
witches
ever
burnt
and
loving
her
old
husband--here
she
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
you
are
to
consider
that
what
you
wish
to
do
is
to
destroy
fine
stuff
such
as
we
have
no
means
of
replacing
and
that
she
bade
you
do
it
singly
to
spite
me
for
i
sought
to
buy
this
bedding
from
her
while
she
was
alive
at
her
own
price
and
that
she
hated
me
because
i
was
young
and
handsome
that
is
a
true
word
that
she
hated
you
for
she
said
so
herself
before
she
wended
says
finnward
so
that
here
is
an
old
faggot
that
hated
me
and
she
dead
as
a
bucket
says
aud
and
here
is
a
young
wife
that
loves
you
dear
and
is
alive
forby--and
at
that
she
kissed
him--and
the
point
is
which
are
you
to
do
the
will
of
the
man's
weakness
caught
him
hard
and
he
faltered
i
fear
some
hurt
will
come
of
it
said
he
there
she
cut
in
and
bade
the
lads
tread
out
the
fire
and
the
lasses
roll
the
bed-stuff
up
and
carry
it
within
my
dear
says
he
my
honour--this
is
against
my
honour
but
she
took
his
arm
under
hers
and
caressed
his
hand
and
kissed
his
knuckles
and
led
him
down
the
bay
bubble-bubble-bubble
says
she
imitating
him
like
a
baby
though
she
was
none
so
young
bubble-bubble
and
a
silly
old
man
we
must
bury
the
troll
wife
and
here
is
trouble
enough
and
a
vengeance
horses
will
sweat
for
it
before
she
comes
to
skalaholt
'tis
my
belief
she
was
a
man
in
a
woman's
habit
and
so
now
have
done
good
man
and
let
us
get
her
waked
and
buried
which
is
more
than
she
deserves
or
her
old
duds
are
like
to
pay
for
and
when
that
is
ended
we
can
consult
upon
the
rest
so
finnward
was
but
too
well
pleased
to
put
it
off
the
next
day
they
set
forth
early
for
skalaholt
across
the
heaths
it
was
heavy
weather
and
grey
overhead
the
horses
sweated
and
neighed
and
the
men
went
silent
for
it
was
nowhere
in
their
minds
that
the
dead
wife
was
canny
only
aud
talked
by
the
way
like
a
silly
sea-gull
piping
on
a
cliff
and
the
rest
held
their
peace
the
sun
went
down
before
they
were
across
whitewater
and
the
black
night
fell
on
them
this
side
of
netherness
at
netherness
they
beat
upon
the
door
the
goodman
was
not
abed
nor
any
of
his
folk
but
sat
in
the
hall
talking
and
to
them
finnward
made
clear
his
business
i
will
never
deny
you
a
roof
said
the
goodman
of
netherness
but
i
have
no
food
ready
and
if
you
cannot
be
doing
without
meat
you
must
e'en
fare
farther
they
laid
the
body
in
a
shed
made
fast
their
horses
and
came
into
the
house
and
the
door
was
closed
again
so
there
they
sat
about
the
lights
and
there
was
little
said
for
they
were
none
so
well
pleased
with
their
reception
presently
in
the
place
where
the
food
was
kept
began
a
clattering
of
dishes
and
it
fell
to
a
bondman
of
the
house
to
go
and
see
what
made
the
clatter
he
was
no
sooner
gone
than
he
was
back
again
and
told
it
was
a
big
buxom
woman
high
in
flesh
and
naked
as
she
was
born
setting
meats
upon
a
dresser
finnward
grew
pale
as
the
dawn
he
got
to
his
feet
and
the
rest
rose
with
him
and
all
the
party
of
the
funeral
came
to
the
buttery-door
and
the
dead
thorgunna
took
no
heed
of
their
coming
but
went
on
setting
forth
meats
and
seemed
to
talk
with
herself
as
she
did
so
and
she
was
naked
to
the
buff
great
fear
fell
upon
them
the
marrow
of
their
back
grew
cold
not
one
word
they
spoke
neither
good
nor
bad
but
back
into
the
hall
and
down
upon
their
bended
knees
and
to
their
prayers
now
in
the
name
of
god
what
ails
you
cried
the
goodman
of
netherness
and
when
they
had
told
him
shame
fell
upon
him
for
his
churlishness
the
dead
wife
reproves
me
said
the
honest
man
and
he
blessed
himself
and
his
house
and
caused
spread
the
tables
and
they
all
ate
of
the
meats
that
the
dead
wife
laid
out
this
was
the
first
walking
of
thorgunna
and
it
is
thought
by
good
judges
it
would
have
been
the
last
as
well
if
men
had
been
more
wise
the
next
day
they
came
to
skalaholt
and
there
was
the
body
buried
and
the
next
after
they
set
out
for
home
finnward's
heart
was
heavy
and
his
mind
divided
he
feared
the
dead
wife
and
the
living
he
feared
dishonour
and
he
feared
dispeace
and
his
will
was
like
a
sea-gull
in
the
wind
now
he
cleared
his
throat
and
made
as
if
to
speak
and
at
that
aud
cocked
her
eye
and
looked
at
the
goodman
mocking
and
his
voice
died
unborn
at
the
last
shame
gave
him
courage
aud
said
he
yon
was
a
most
uncanny
thing
at
netherness
no
doubt
said
aud
i
have
never
had
it
in
my
mind
said
he
that
yon
woman
was
the
thing
she
should
be
i
dare
say
not
said
aud
i
never
thought
so
either
it
stands
beyond
question
she
was
more
than
canny
says
finnward
shaking
his
head
no
manner
of
doubt
but
what
she
was
ancient
of
mind
she
was
getting
pretty
old
in
body
too
says
aud
wife
says
he
it
comes
in
upon
me
strongly
this
is
no
kind
of
woman
to
disobey
above
all
being
dead
and
her
walking
i
think
wife
we
must
even
do
as
she
commanded
now
what
is
ever
your
word
says
she
riding
up
close
and
setting
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
'the
goodwife's
pleasure
must
be
done'
is
not
that
my
finnward
the
good
god
knows
i
grudge
you
nothing
cried
finnward
but
my
blood
runs
cold
upon
this
business
worse
will
come
of
it
he
cried
worse
will
flow
from
it
what
is
this
todo
cries
aud
here
is
an
old
brimstone
hag
that
should
have
been
stoned
with
stones
and
hated
me
besides
vainly
she
tried
to
frighten
me
when
she
was
living
shall
she
frighten
me
now
when
she
is
dead
and
rotten
i
trow
not
think
shame
to
your
beard
goodman
are
these
a
man's
shoes
i
see
you
shaking
in
when
your
wife
rides
by
your
bridle-hand
as
bold
as
nails
ay
ay
quoth
finnward
but
there
goes
a
byword
in
the
country
little
wit
little
fear
at
this
aud
began
to
be
concerned
for
he
was
usually
easier
to
lead
so
now
she
tried
the
other
method
on
the
man
is
that
your
word
cried
she
i
kiss
the
hands
of
ye
if
i
have
not
wit
enough
i
can
rid
you
of
my
company
wit
is
it
he
seeks
she
cried
the
old
broomstick
that
we
buried
yesterday
had
wit
for
you
so
she
rode
on
ahead
and
looked
not
the
road
that
he
was
on
poor
finnward
followed
on
his
horse
but
the
light
of
the
day
was
gone
out
for
his
wife
was
like
his
life
to
him
he
went
six
miles
and
was
true
to
his
heart
but
the
seventh
was
not
half
through
when
he
rode
up
to
her
is
it
to
be
the
goodwife's
pleasure
she
asked
aud
you
shall
have
your
way
says
he
god
grant
there
come
no
ill
of
it
so
she
made
much
of
him
and
his
heart
was
comforted
when
they
came
to
the
house
aud
had
the
two
chests
to
her
own
bed-place
and
gloated
all
night
on
what
she
found
finnward
looked
on
and
trouble
darkened
his
mind
wife
says
he
at
last
you
will
not
forget
these
things
belong
to
asdis
at
that
she
barked
upon
him
like
a
dog
am
i
a
thief
she
cried
the
brat
shall
have
them
in
her
turn
when
she
grows
up
would
you
have
me
give
her
them
now
to
turn
her
minx's
head
with
so
the
weak
man
went
his
way
out
of
the
house
in
sorrow
and
fell
to
his
affairs
those
that
wrought
with
him
that
day
observed
that
now
he
would
labour
and
toil
like
a
man
furious
and
now
would
sit
and
stare
like
one
stupid
for
in
truth
he
judged
the
business
would
end
ill
for
a
while
there
was
no
more
done
and
no
more
said
aud
cherished
her
treasures
by
herself
and
none
was
the
wiser
except
finnward
only
the
cloak
she
sometimes
wore
for
that
was
hers
by
the
will
of
the
dead
wife
but
the
others
she
let
lie
because
she
knew
she
had
them
foully
and
she
feared
finnward
somewhat
and
thorgunna
much
at
last
husband
and
wife
were
bound
to
bed
one
night
and
he
was
the
first
stripped
and
got
in
what
sheets
are
these
he
screamed
as
his
legs
touched
them
for
these
were
smooth
as
water
but
the
sheets
of
iceland
were
like
sacking
clean
sheets
i
suppose
says
aud
but
her
hand
quavered
as
she
wound
her
hair
woman
cried
finnward
these
are
the
bed-sheets
of
thorgunna--these
are
the
sheets
she
died
in
do
not
lie
to
me
at
that
aud
turned
and
looked
at
him
well
says
she
they
have
been
washed
finnward
lay
down
again
in
the
bed
between
thorgunna's
sheets
and
groaned
never
a
word
more
he
said
for
now
he
knew
he
was
a
coward
and
a
man
dishonoured
presently
his
wife
came
beside
him
and
they
lay
still
but
neither
slept
it
might
be
twelve
in
the
night
when
aud
felt
finnward
shudder
so
strong
that
the
bed
shook
what
ails
you
said
she
i
know
not
he
said
it
is
a
chill
like
the
chill
of
death
my
soul
is
sick
with
it
his
voice
fell
low
it
was
so
thorgunna
sickened
said
he
and
he
arose
and
walked
in
the
hall
in
the
dark
till
it
came
morning
early
in
the
morning
he
went
forth
to
the
sea-fishing
with
four
lads
aud
was
troubled
at
heart
and
watched
him
from
the
door
and
even
as
he
went
down
the
beach
she
saw
him
shaken
with
thorgunna's
shudder
it
was
a
rough
day
the
sea
was
wild
the
boat
laboured
exceedingly
and
it
may
be
that
finnward's
mind
was
troubled
with
his
sickness
certain
it
is
that
they
struck
and
their
boat
was
burst
upon
a
skerry
under
snowfellness
the
four
lads
were
spilled
into
the
sea
and
the
sea
broke
and
buried
them
but
finnward
was
cast
upon
the
skerry
and
clambered
up
and
sat
there
all
day
long
god
knows
his
thoughts
the
sun
was
half-way
down
when
a
shepherd
went
by
on
the
cliffs
about
his
business
and
spied
a
man
in
the
midst
of
the
breach
of
the
loud
seas
upon
a
pinnacle
of
reef
he
hailed
him
and
the
man
turned
and
hailed
again
there
was
in
that
cove
so
great
a
clashing
of
the
seas
and
so
shrill
a
cry
of
sea-fowl
that
the
herd
might
hear
the
voice
and
nor
the
words
but
the
name
thorgunna
came
to
him
and
he
saw
the
face
of
finnward
keelfarer
like
the
face
of
an
old
man
lively
ran
the
herd
to
finnward's
house
and
when
his
tale
was
told
there
eyolf
the
boy
was
lively
to
out
a
boat
and
hasten
to
his
father's
aid
by
the
strength
of
hands
they
drove
the
keel
against
the
seas
and
with
skill
and
courage
eyolf
won
upon
the
skerry
and
climbed
up
there
sat
his
father
dead
and
this
was
the
first
vengeance
of
thorgunna
against
broken
faith
it
was
a
sore
job
to
get
the
corpse
on
board
and
a
sorer
yet
to
bring
it
home
before
the
rolling
seas
but
the
lad
eyolf
was
a
lad
of
promise
and
the
lads
that
pulled
for
him
were
sturdy
men
so
the
break-faith's
body
was
got
home
and
waked
and
buried
on
the
hill
aud
was
a
good
widow
and
wept
much
for
she
liked
finnward
well
enough
yet
a
bird
sang
in
her
ears
that
now
she
might
marry
a
young
man
little
fear
that
she
might
have
her
choice
of
them
she
thought
with
all
thorgunna's
fine
things
and
her
heart
was
cheered
now
when
the
corpse
was
laid
in
the
hill
asdis
came
where
aud
sat
solitary
in
hall
and
stood
by
her
awhile
without
speech
well
child
says
aud
and
again
well
and
then
keep
us
holy
if
you
have
anything
to
say
out
with
it
so
the
maid
came
so
much
nearer
mother
says
she
i
wish
you
would
not
wear
these
things
that
were
thorgunna's
aha
cries
aud
this
is
what
it
is
you
begin
early
brat
and
who
has
been
poisoning
your
mind
your
fool
of
a
father
i
suppose
and
then
she
stopped
and
went
all
scarlet
who
told
you
they
were
yours
she
asked
again
taking
it
all
the
higher
for
her
stumble
when
you
are
grown
then
you
shall
have
your
share
and
not
a
day
before
these
things
are
not
for
babies
the
child
looked
at
her
and
was
amazed
i
do
not
wish
them
she
said
i
wish
they
might
be
burned
upon
my
word
what
next
cried
aud
and
why
should
they
be
burned
i
know
my
father
tried
to
burn
these
things
said
asdis
and
he
named
thorgunna's
name
upon
the
skerry
ere
he
died
and
o
mother
i
doubt
they
have
brought
ill
luck
but
the
more
aud
was
terrified
the
more
she
would
make
light
of
it
then
the
girl
put
her
hand
upon
her
mother's
i
fear
they
are
ill
come
by
said
she
the
blood
sprang
in
aud's
face
and
who
made
you
a
judge
upon
your
mother
that
bore
you
cried
she
kinswoman
said
asdis
looking
down
i
saw
you
with
the
brooch
what
do
you
mean
when
where
did
you
see
me
cried
the
mother
here
in
the
hall
said
asdis
looking
on
the
floor
the
night
you
stole
it
at
that
aud
let
out
a
cry
then
she
heaved
up
her
hand
to
strike
the
child
you
little
spy
she
cried
then
she
covered
her
face
and
wept
and
rocked
herself
what
can
you
know
she
cried
how
can
you
understand
that
are
a
baby
not
so
long
weaned
he
could--your
father
could
the
dear
good
man
dead
and
gone
he
could
understand
and
pity
he
was
good
to
me
now
he
has
left
me
alone
with
heartless
children
asdis
she
cried
have
you
no
nature
in
your
blood
you
do
not
know
what
i
have
done
and
suffered
for
them
i
have
done--oh
and
i
could
have
done
anything
and
there
is
your
father
dead
and
after
all
you
ask
me
not
to
use
them
no
woman
in
iceland
has
the
like
and
you
wish
me
to
destroy
them
not
if
the
dead
should
rise
she
cried
no
no
and
she
stopped
her
ears
not
if
the
dead
should
rise
and
let
that
end
it
so
she
ran
into
her
bed-place
and
clapped
at
the
door
and
left
the
child
amazed
but
for
all
aud
spoke
with
so
much
passion
it
was
noticed
that
for
long
she
left
the
things
unused
only
she
would
be
locked
somewhile
daily
in
her
bed-place
where
she
pored
on
them
and
secretly
wore
them
for
her
pleasure
now
winter
was
at
hand
the
days
grew
short
and
the
nights
long
and
under
the
golden
face
of
morning
the
isle
would
stand
silver
with
frost
word
came
from
holyfell
to
frodis
water
of
a
company
of
young
men
upon
a
journey
that
night
they
supped
at
holyfell
the
next
it
would
be
at
frodis
water
and
alf
of
the
fells
was
there
and
thongbrand
ketilson
and
hall
the
fair
aud
went
early
to
her
bed-place
and
there
she
pored
upon
these
fineries
till
her
heart
was
melted
with
self-love
there
was
a
kirtle
of
a
mingled
colour
and
the
blue
shot
into
the
green
and
the
green
lightened
from
the
blue
as
the
colours
play
in
the
ocean
between
deeps
and
shallows
she
thought
she
could
endure
to
live
no
longer
and
not
wear
it
there
was
a
bracelet
of
an
ell
long
wrought
like
a
serpent
and
with
fiery
jewels
for
the
eyes
she
saw
it
shine
on
her
white
arm
and
her
head
grew
dizzy
with
desire
ah
she
thought
never
were
fine
lendings
better
met
with
a
fair
wearer
and
she
closed
her
eyelids
and
she
thought
she
saw
herself
among
the
company
and
the
men's
eyes
go
after
her
admiring
with
that
she
considered
that
she
must
soon
marry
one
of
them
and
wondered
which
and
she
thought
alf
was
perhaps
the
best
or
hall
the
fair
but
was
not
certain
and
then
she
remembered
finnward
keelfarer
in
his
cairn
upon
the
hill
and
was
concerned
well
he
was
a
good
husband
to
me
she
thought
and
i
was
a
good
wife
to
him
but
that
is
an
old
song
now
so
she
turned
again
to
handling
the
stuffs
and
jewels
at
last
she
got
to
bed
in
the
smooth
sheets
and
lay
and
fancied
how
she
would
look
and
admired
herself
and
saw
others
admire
her
and
told
herself
stories
till
her
heart
grew
warm
and
she
chuckled
to
herself
between
the
sheets
so
she
shook
awhile
with
laughter
and
then
the
mirth
abated
but
not
the
shaking
and
a
grue
took
hold
upon
her
flesh
and
the
cold
of
the
grave
upon
her
belly
and
the
terror
of
death
upon
her
soul
with
that
a
voice
was
in
her
ear
it
was
so
thorgunna
sickened
thrice
in
the
night
the
chill
and
the
terror
took
her
and
thrice
it
passed
away
and
when
she
rose
on
the
morrow
death
had
breathed
upon
her
countenance
she
saw
the
house
folk
and
her
children
gaze
upon
her
well
she
knew
why
she
knew
her
day
was
come
and
the
last
of
her
days
and
her
last
hour
was
at
her
back
and
it
was
so
in
her
soul
that
she
scarce
minded
all
was
lost
all
was
past
mending
she
would
carry
on
until
she
fell
so
she
went
as
usual
and
hurried
the
feast
for
the
young
men
and
railed
upon
her
house
folk
but
her
feet
stumbled
and
her
voice
was
strange
in
her
own
ears
and
the
eyes
of
the
folk
fled
before
her
at
times
too
the
chill
took
her
and
the
fear
along
with
it
and
she
must
sit
down
and
the
teeth
beat
together
in
her
head
and
the
stool
tottered
on
the
floor
at
these
times
she
thought
she
was
passing
and
the
voice
of
thorgunna
sounded
in
her
ear
the
things
are
for
no
use
but
to
be
shown
it
said
aud
aud
have
you
shown
them
once
no
not
once
and
at
the
sting
of
the
thought
her
courage
and
strength
would
revive
and
she
would
rise
again
and
move
about
her
business
now
the
hour
drew
near
and
aud
went
to
her
bed-place
and
did
on
the
bravest
of
her
finery
and
came
forth
to
greet
her
guests
was
never
woman
in
iceland
robed
as
she
was
the
words
of
greeting
were
yet
between
her
lips
when
the
shuddering
fell
upon
her
strong
as
labour
and
a
horror
as
deep
as
hell
her
face
was
changed
amidst
her
finery
and
the
faces
of
her
guests
were
changed
as
they
beheld
her
fear
puckered
their
brows
fear
drew
back
their
feet
and
she
took
her
doom
from
the
looks
of
them
and
fled
to
her
bed-place
there
she
flung
herself
on
the
wife's
coverlet
and
turned
her
face
against
the
wall
that
was
the
end
of
all
the
words
of
aud
and
in
the
small
hours
on
the
clock
her
spirit
wended
asdis
had
come
to
and
fro
seeing
if
she
might
help
where
was
no
help
possible
of
man
or
woman
it
was
light
in
the
bed-place
when
the
maid
returned
for
a
taper
stood
upon
a
chest
there
lay
aud
in
her
fine
clothes
and
there
by
her
side
on
the
bed
the
big
dead
wife
thorgunna
squatted
on
her
hams
no
sound
was
heard
but
it
seemed
by
the
movement
of
her
mouth
as
if
thorgunna
sang
and
she
waved
her
arms
as
if
to
singing
god
be
good
to
us
cried
asdis
she
is
dead
dead

the
dead
wife

done
the

thorgunna

with
that
she
was
not
but
the
next
day
eyolf

caused

a
fire

shore
betwixt

there
they
burned
the
bed-clothes
and
the
clothes
and
the
jewels
and
the
very
boards
of
the
waif
woman's
chests
and
when
the
tide
returned
it
washed
away
their
ashes
