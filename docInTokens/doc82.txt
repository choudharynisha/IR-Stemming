theories
what
is
the
good
of
theories
they
are
the
scourges
that
lash
our
minds
in
modern
days
lash
them
into
confusion
perplexity
despair
i
have
never
been
troubled
by
them
before
why
should
i
be
troubled
by
them
now
and
the
absurdity
of
professor
blackâ€™s
is
surely
obvious
a
child
would
laugh
at
it
yes
a
child
i
have
never
been
a
diary
writer
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
the
amusement
of
sitting
down
late
at
night
and
scrawling
minutely
in
some
hidden
book
every
paltry
incident
of
oneâ€™s
paltry
days
people
say
it
is
so
interesting
to
read
the
entries
years
afterwards
to
read
as
a
man
the
menu
that
i
ate
through
as
a
boy
the
love-story
that
i
was
actor
in
the
tragedy
that
i
brought
about
the
debt
that
i
have
never
paid--how
could
it
profit
me
to
keep
a
diary
has
always
seemed
to
me
merely
an
addition
to
the
ills
of
life
yet
now
i
have
a
hidden
book
like
the
rest
of
the
world
and
i
am
scrawling
in
it
to-day
yes
but
for
a
reason
i
want
to
make
things
clear
to
myself
and
i
find
as
others
that
my
mind
works
more
easily
with
the
assistance
of
the
pen
the
actual
tracing
of
words
on
paper
dispels
the
clouds
that
cluster
round
my
thoughts
i
shall
recall
events
to
set
my
mind
at
ease
to
prove
to
myself
how
absurd
a
man
who
could
believe
in
professor
black
would
be
â€œlittle
dry-as-dustâ€
i
used
to
call
him
â€˜dryâ€™
he
is
full
of
wild
romance
rubbish
that
a
school-girl
would
be
ashamed
to
believe
in
yet
he
is
abnormally
clever
his
record
proves
that
still
clever
men
are
the
first
to
be
led
astray
they
say
it
is
the
searcher
who
follows
the
wandering
light
what
he
says
canâ€™t
be
true
when
i
have
filled
these
pages
and
read
what
i
have
written
dispassionately
as
one
of
the
outside
public
might
read
i
shall
have
done
once
for
all
with
the
ridiculous
fancies
that
are
beginning
to
make
my
life
a
burden
to
put
my
thoughts
in
order
will
make
a
music
the
evil
spirit
within
me
will
sleep
will
die
i
shall
be
cured
it
must
be
so--it
shall
be
so
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
ah
what
a
long
time
ago
that
seems
as
a
child
i
was
cruel
most
boys
are
cruel
i
think
my
school
companions
were
a
merciless
set--merciless
to
one
another
to
their
masters
when
they
had
a
chance
to
animals
to
birds
the
desire
to
torture
was
in
nearly
all
of
them
they
loved
to
bully
and
if
they
bullied
only
mildly
it
was
from
fear
not
from
love
they
did
not
wish
their
boomerang
to
return
and
slay
them
if
a
boy
were
deformed
they
twitted
him
if
a
master
were
kind
or
gentle
or
shy
they
made
his
life
as
intolerable
as
they
could
if
an
animal
or
a
bird
came
into
their
power
they
had
no
pity
i
was
like
the
rest
indeed
i
think
that
i
was
worse
cruelty
is
horrible
i
have
enough
imagination
to
do
more
than
know
that--to
feel
it
some
say
that
it
is
lack
of
imagination
which
makes
men
and
women
brutes
may
it
not
be
power
of
imagination
the
interest
of
torturing
is
lessened
is
almost
lost
if
we
can
not
be
the
tortured
as
well
as
the
torturer
as
a
child
i
was
cruel
by
nature
by
instinct
i
was
a
handsome
well-bred
gentlemanlike
gentle-looking
little
brute
my
parents
adored
me
and
i
was
good
to
them
they
were
so
kind
to
me
that
i
was
almost
fond
of
them
why
not
it
seemed
to
me
as
politic
to
be
fond
of
them
as
of
anyone
else
i
did
what
i
pleased
but
i
did
not
always
let
them
know
it
so
i
pleased
them
the
wise
child
will
take
care
to
foster
the
ignorance
of
its
parents
my
people
were
pretty
well
off
and
i
was
their
only
child
but
my
chief
chances
of
future
pleasure
in
life
were
centred
in
my
grandmother
my
motherâ€™s
mother
she
was
immensely
rich
and
she
lived
here
this
room
in
which
i
am
writing
now
was
her
favourite
sitting-room
on
that
hearth
before
a
log
fire
such
as
is
burning
at
this
moment
used
to
sit
that
wonderful
cat
of
hers--that
horrible
cat
why
did
i
ever
play
my
childish
cards
to
win
this
house
this
place
sometimes
lately--very
lately
only--i
have
wondered
like
a
fool
perhaps
yet
would
professor
black
say
so
i
remember
as
a
boy
of
sixteen
paying
my
last
visit
here
to
my
grandmother
it
bored
me
very
much
to
come
but
she
was
said
to
be
near
death
and
death
leaves
great
houses
vacant
for
others
to
fill
so
when
my
mother
said
that
i
had
better
come
and
my
father
added
that
he
thought
my
grandmother
was
fonder
of
me
than
of
my
other
relations
i
gave
up
all
my
boyish
plans
for
the
holidays
with
apparent
willingness
though
almost
a
child
i
was
not
short-sighted
i
knew
every
boy
had
a
future
as
well
as
a
present
i
gave
up
my
plans
and
came
here
with
a
smile
but
in
my
heart
i
hated
my
grandmother
for
having
power
and
so
bending
me
to
relinquish
pleasure
for
boredom
i
hated
her
and
i
came
to
her
and
kissed
her
and
saw
her
beautiful
white
persian
cat
sitting
before
the
fire
in
this
room
and
thought
of
the
fellow
who
was
my
bosom
friend
and
with
whom
i
longed
to
be
shooting
or
fishing
or
riding
and
i
looked
at
the
cat
again
i
remember
it
began
to
purr
when
i
went
near
to
it
it
sat
quite
still
with
its
blue
eyes
fixed
upon
the
fire
but
when
i
approached
it
i
heard
it
purr
complacently
i
longed
to
kick
it
the
limitations
of
its
ridiculous
life
satisfied
it
completely
it
seemed
to
reproduce
in
an
absurd
diminished
way
my
grandmother
in
her
white
lace
cap
with
her
white
face
and
hands
she
sat
in
her
chair
all
day
and
looked
at
the
fire
the
cat
sat
on
the
hearthrug
and
did
the
same
the
cat
seemed
to
me
the
animal
personification
of
the
human
being
who
kept
me
chained
from
all
the
sports
and
pleasures
i
had
promised
myself
for
the
holidays
when
i
went
near
to
the
cat
and
heard
it
calmly
purring
at
me
i
longed
to
do
it
an
injury
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
it
understood
what
my
grandmother
did
not
and
was
complacently
triumphing
at
my
voluntary
imprisonment
with
age
and
laughing
to
itself
at
the
pains
men--and
boys--will
undergo
for
the
sake
of
money
brute
i
did
not
love
my
grandmother
and
she
had
money
i
hated
the
cat
utterly
it
hadnâ€™t
a
sou
this
beautiful
house
is
not
old
my
grandfather
built
it
himself
he
had
no
love
for
the
life
of
towns
i
believe
but
was
passionately
in
touch
with
nature
and
when
a
young
man
he
set
out
on
a
strange
tour
through
england
his
object
was
to
find
a
perfect
view
and
in
front
of
that
view
he
intended
to
build
himself
a
habitation
for
nearly
a
year
so
i
have
been
told
he
wandered
through
scotland
and
england
and
at
last
he
came
to
this
place
in
cumberland
to
this
village
to
this
very
spot
here
his
wanderings
ceased
standing
on
the
terrace--then
uncultivated
forest--that
runs
in
front
of
these
windows
he
found
at
last
what
he
desired
he
bought
the
forest
he
bought
the
windings
of
the
river
the
fields
upon
its
banks
and
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
steep
gorge
through
which
it
runs
he
built
the
lovely
dwelling
that
to-day
is
mine
this
place
is
no
ordinary
place
it
is
characteristic
in
the
highest
degree
the
house
is
wonderfully
situated
with
the
ground
falling
abruptly
in
front
of
it
the
river
forming
almost
a
horseshoe
round
it
the
woods
are
lovely
the
garden
curiously
almost
wildly
laid
out
is
like
no
other
garden
i
ever
saw
and
the
house
though
not
old
is
full
of
little
surprises
curiously
shaped
rooms
remarkable
staircases
quaint
recesses
the
place
is
a
place
to
remember
the
house
is
a
house
to
fix
itself
in
the
memory
nothing
that
had
once
lived
here
could
ever
come
back
and
forget
that
it
had
been
here
not
even
an
animal--not
even
an
animal
i
wish
i
had
never
gone
to
that
dinnerparty
and
met
the
professor
there
was
a
horror
coming
upon
me
then
he
has
hastened
its
steps
he
has
put
my
fears
into
shape
my
vague
wondering
into
words
why
cannot
men
leave
life
alone
why
will
they
catch
it
by
the
throat
and
wring
its
secrets
from
it
to
respect
reserve
is
one
of
the
first
instincts
of
the
gentleman
and
life
is
full
of
reserve
it
is
getting
very
late
i
thought
i
heard
a
step
in
the
house
just
now
i
wonder--i
wonder
if
she
is
asleep
i
wish
i
knew
day
after
day
passed
by
my
grandmother
seemed
to
be
failing
but
almost
imperceptibly
she
evidently
loved
to
have
me
near
to
her
like
most
old
dying
people
in
her
mind
she
frantically
clutched
at
life
that
could
give
to
her
nothing
more
and
i
believe
she
grew
to
regard
me
as
the
personification
of
all
that
was
leaving
her
my
vitality
warmed
her
she
extended
her
hands
to
my
flaming
hearthfire
she
seemed
trying
to
live
in
my
life
and
at
length
became
afraid
to
let
me
out
of
her
sight
one
day
she
said
to
me
in
her
quavering
ugly
voice--old
voices
are
so
ugly
like
hideous
echoes
â€œronald
i
could
never
die
while
you
were
in
the
room
so
long
as
you
are
with
me
where
i
can
touch
you
i
shall
liveâ€
and
she
put
out
her
white
corrugated
hand
and
fondled
my
warm
boyâ€™s
hand
how
i
longed
to
push
her
hand
away
and
get
out
into
the
sunlight
and
the
air
and
hear
young
voices
the
voices
of
the
morning
not
of
the
twilight
and
be
away
from
wrinkled
death
that
seemed
sitting
on
the
doorstep
of
that
house
huddled
up
like
a
beggar
waiting
for
the
door
to
be
opened
i
was
bored
till
i
grew
malignant
i
confess
it
and
feeling
malignant
i
began
to
long
more
and
more
passionately
to
vent
myself
on
someone
or
something
i
looked
at
the
cat
which
as
usual
was
sitting
before
the
fire
animals
have
intuitions
as
keen
as
those
of
a
woman
keener
than
those
of
a
man
they
inherit
an
instinct
of
fear
of
those
who
hate
them
from
a
long
line
of
ancestors
who
have
suffered
at
the
hands
of
cruel
men
they
can
tell
by
a
look
by
a
motion
by
the
tone
of
a
voice
whether
to
expect
from
anyone
kindness
or
malignity
the
cat
had
purred
complacently
on
the
first
day
of
my
arrival
and
had
hunched
up
her
white
furry
back
towards
my
hand
and
had
smiled
with
her
calm
light-blue
eyes
now
when
i
approached
her
she
seemed
to
gather
herself
together
and
to
make
herself
small
she
shrank
from
me
there
was--as
i
fancied--a
dawning
comprehension
a
dawning
terror
in
her
blue
eyes
she
always
sat
very
close
to
my
grandmother
now
as
if
she
sought
protection
and
she
watched
me
as
if
she
were
watching
for
an
intention
which
she
apprehended
to
grow
in
my
mind
and
the
intention
came
for
as
the
days
went
on
and
my
grandmother
still
lived
i
began
to
grow
desperate
my
holiday
time
was
over
now
but
my
parents
wrote
telling
me
to
stay
where
i
was
and
not
to
think
of
returning
to
school
my
grandmother
had
caused
a
letter
to
be
sent
to
them
in
which
she
said
that
she
could
not
part
from
me
and
added
that
my
parents
would
never
have
cause
to
regret
interrupting
my
education
for
a
time
â€œhe
will
be
paid
in
full
for
every
moment
he
losesâ€
she
wrote
referring
to
me
it
seemed
a
strange
taste
in
her
to
care
so
much
for
a
boy
but
she
had
never
loved
women
and
i
was
handsome
and
she
liked
handsome
faces
the
brutality
in
my
nature
was
not
written
upon
my
features
i
had
smiling
frank
brown
eyes
a
lithe
young
figure
a
gay
boyâ€™s
voice
my
movements
were
quick
and
i
have
always
been
told
that
my
gestures
were
never
awkward
my
demeanour
was
never
unfinished
as
is
the
case
so
often
with
lads
at
school
outwardly
i
was
attractive
and
the
old
woman
who
had
married
two
husbands
merely
for
their
looks
delighted
in
feeling
that
she
had
the
power
to
retain
me
by
her
side
at
an
age
when
most
boys
avoid
old
people
as
if
they
were
the
pestilence
and
then
i
pretended
to
love
her
and
obeyed
all
her
insufferably
tiresome
behests
but
i
longed
to
wreak
vengeance
upon
her
all
the
same
my
dearest
friend
the
fellow
with
whom
i
was
to
have
spent
my
holidays
was
leaving
at
the
end
of
this
term
which
i
was
missing
he
wrote
to
me
furious
letters
urging
me
to
come
back
and
reproaching
me
for
my
selfishness
and
lack
of
affection
each
time
i
received
one
i
looked
at
the
cat
and
the
cat
shrank
nearer
to
my
grandmotherâ€™s
chair
it
never
purred
now
and
nothing
would
induce
it
to
leave
the
room
where
she
sat
one
day
the
servant
said
to
me
â€œi
believe
the
poor
dumb
thing
knows
my
mistress
canâ€™t
last
very
much
longer
sir
the
way
that
cat
looks
up
at
her
goes
to
my
heart
ah
them
beasts
understand
things
as
well
as
we
do
i
believeâ€
i
think
the
cat
understood
quite
well
it
did
watch
my
grandmother
in
a
very
strange
way
gazing
up
into
her
face
as
if
to
mark
the
changing
contours
the
increasing
lines
the
down-droop
of
the
features
that
bespoke
the
gradual
soft
approach
of
death
it
listened
to
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
as
each
day
the
voice
grew
more
vague
more
weak
and
toneless
an
anxiety
that
made
me
exult
dawned
and
deepened
in
its
blue
eyes
or
so
i
thought
i
had
a
great
deal
of
morbid
imagination
at
that
age
and
loved
to
weave
a
web
of
fancies
mostly
horrible
around
almost
everything
that
entered
into
my
life
it
pleased
me
to
believe
that
the
cat
understood
each
new
intention
that
came
into
my
mind
read
me
silently
from
its
place
near
the
fire
tracked
my
thoughts
and
was
terror-stricken
as
they
concentrated
themselves
round
a
definite
resolve
which
hardened
and
toughened
day
by
day
it
pleased
me
to
believe
do
i
say
i
did
really
believe
and
do
believe
now
that
the
cat
understood
all
and
grew
haggard
with
fear
as
my
grandmother
failed
visibly
for
it
knew
what
the
end
would
mean
for
it
that
first
day
of
my
arrival
when
i
saw
my
grandmother
in
her
white
cap
with
her
white
face
and
hands
and
the
big
white
cat
sitting
near
to
her
i
had
thought
there
was
a
similarity
between
them
that
similarity
struck
me
more
forcibly
grew
upon
me
as
my
time
in
the
house
grew
longer
until
the
latter
seemed
almost
a
reproduction
of
the
former
and
after
each
letter
from
my
friend
my
hate
for
the
two
increased
but
my
hate
for
my
grandmother
was
impotent
and
would
always
be
so
i
could
never
repay
her
for
the
ennui
the
furious
forced
inactivity
which
made
my
life
a
burden
and
spurred
my
bad
passions
while
they
lulled
me
in
a
terrible
enforced
repose
i
could
repay
her
favourite
the
thing
she
had
always
cherished
her
feline
confidant
who
lived
in
safety
under
the
shadow
of
her
protection
i
could
wreak
my
fury
on
that
when
the
protection
was
withdrawn
as
it
must
be
at
last
it
seemed
to
my
brutal
imaginative
unfinished
boyâ€™s
mind
that
the
murder
of
her
pet
must
hurt
and
wound
my
grandmother
even
after
she
was
dead
i
would
make
her
suffer
then
when
she
was
impotent
to
wreak
a
vengeance
upon
me
i
would
kill
the
cat
the
creature
knew
my
resolve
the
day
i
made
it
and
had
even
i
should
say
anticipated
it
as
i
sat
day
after
day
beside
my
grandmotherâ€™s
armchair
in
the
dim
room
with
the
blinds
drawn
to
shut
out
the
summer
sunlight
and
talked
to
her
in
a
subdued
and
reverent
voice
agreeing
with
all
the
old
banalities
she
uttered
all
the
preposterous
opinions
she
propounded
all
the
commands
she
laid
upon
me
i
gazed
beyond
her
at
the
cat
and
the
creature
was
haggard
with
apprehension
it
knew
as
i
knew
that
its
day
was
coming
sometimes
i
bent
down
and
took
it
up
on
my
lap
to
please
my
grandmother
and
praised
its
beauty
and
its
gentleness
to
her
and
all
the
time
i
felt
its
warm
furry
body
trembling
with
horror
between
my
hands
this
pleased
me
and
i
pretended
that
i
was
never
happy
unless
it
was
on
my
knees
i
kept
it
there
for
hours
stroking
it
so
tenderly
smoothing
its
thick
white
coat
which
was
always
in
the
most
perfect
order
talking
to
it
caressing
it
and
sometimes
i
took
its
head
between
my
two
hands
turned
its
face
to
mine
and
stared
into
its
large
blue
eyes
then
i
could
read
all
its
agony
all
its
torture
of
apprehension
and
in
spite
of
my
friendâ€™s
letters
and
the
dulness
of
my
days
i
was
almost
happy
the
summer
was
deepening
the
glow
of
the
roses
flushed
the
garden
ways
the
skies
were
clear
above
scawfell
when
the
end
at
last
drew
near
my
grandmotherâ€™s
face
was
now
scarcely
recognizable
the
eyes
were
sunk
deep
in
her
head
all
expression
seemed
to
fade
gradually
away
her
cheeks
were
no
longer
fine
ivory
white
a
dull
sickening
yellow
pallor
overspread
them
she
seldom
looked
at
me
now
but
rested
entombed
in
her
great
armchair
her
shrunken
limbs
seeming
to
tend
downwards
as
if
she
were
inclined
to
slide
to
the
floor
and
die
there
her
lips
were
thin
and
dry
and
moved
perpetually
in
a
silent
chattering
as
if
her
mind
were
talking
and
her
voice
were
already
dead
the
tide
of
life
was
retreating
from
her
body
i
could
almost
see
it
visibly
ebb
away
the
failing
waves
made
no
sound
upon
the
shore
death
is
uncanny
like
all
silent
things
her
maid
wished
her
to
stay
entirely
in
bed
but
she
would
get
up
muttering
that
she
was
well
and
the
doctor
said
it
was
useless
to
hinder
her
she
had
no
specific
disease
only
the
years
were
taking
their
last
toll
of
her
so
she
was
placed
in
her
chair
each
day
by
the
fire
and
sat
there
till
evening
muttering
with
those
dry
lips
the
stiff
folds
of
her
silken
skirts
formed
an
angle
and
there
the
cat
crouched
hour
after
hour
a
silent
white
waiting
thing
and
the
waves
ebbed
and
ebbed
away
and
i
waited
too
one
afternoon
as
i
sat
by
my
grandmother
the
servant
entered
with
a
letter
for
me
just
arrived
by
the
post
i
took
it
up
it
was
from
willoughby
my
school-friend
he
said
the
term
was
over
that
he
had
left
school
and
his
father
had
decided
to
send
him
out
to
america
to
start
in
business
in
new
york
instead
of
entering
him
at
oxford
as
he
had
hoped
he
bade
me
good-bye
and
said
he
supposed
we
should
not
meet
again
for
years
â€œbutâ€
he
added
â€œno
doubt
you
wonâ€™t
care
a
straw
so
long
as
you
get
the
confounded
money
youâ€™re
after
youâ€™ve
taught
me
one
of
the
lessons
of
life
young
ronald--never
to
believe
in
friendshipâ€
as
i
read
the
letter
i
set
my
teeth
all
that
was
good
in
my
nature
centred
round
willoughby
he
was
a
really
fine
fellow
i
honestly
and
truly
loved
him
his
news
gave
me
a
bitter
shock
and
turned
my
heart
to
iron
and
to
fire
perhaps
i
should
never
see
him
again
even
if
i
did
time
would
have
changed
him
seared
him--my
friend
in
his
wonderful
youth
with
the
morning
in
his
eyes
would
be
no
more
i
hated
myself
in
that
moment
for
having
stayed
i
hated
still
more
her
who
had
kept
me
for
the
moment
i
was
carried
out
of
myself
i
crushed
the
letter
up
in
my
burning
hand
i
turned
fiercely
round
upon
that
yellow
enigmatic
dying
figure
in
the
great
chair
all
the
fury
locked
within
my
heart
for
so
long
rose
to
the
surface
and
drove
self-interest
away
i
turned
upon
my
grandmother
with
blazing
eyes
and
trembling
limbs
i
opened
my
mouth
to
utter
a
torrent
of
reproachful
words
when--what
was
it--what
slight
change
had
stolen
into
the
wrinkled
yellow
face
i
bent
over
her
the
eyes
gazed
at
me
but
so
horribly
she
sat
so
low
in
her
chair
she
looked
so
fearful
so
very
strange
i
put
my
fingers
on
her
eyelids
i
drew
them
down
over
the
eyeballs
they
did
not
open
again
i
felt
her
withered
hands
they
were
ice
then
i
knew
and
i
felt
myself
smiling
i
leaned
over
the
dead
woman
there
on
the
far
side
of
her
crouched
the
cat
its
white
fur
was
all
bristling
its
blue
eyes
were
dilated
on
its
jaws
there
were
flecks
of
foam
i
leaned
over
the
dead
woman
and
took
it
in
my
arms

that
was
nearly
twenty
years
ago
and
yet
to-night
the
memory
of
that
moment
and
what
followed
it
bring
a
fear
to
my
heart
which
i
must
combat
i
have
read
of
men
who
lived
for
long
spaces
of
time
haunted
by
demons
created
by
their
imagination
and
i
have
laughed
at
them
and
pitied
them
surely
i
am
not
going
to
join
in
their
folly
in
their
madness
led
to
the
gates
of
terror
by
my
own
fancies
half-confirmed
apparently
by
the
chance
utterances
of
a
conceited
professor--a
man
of
fads
although
a
man
of
science
that
was
twenty
years
ago
after
to-night
let
me
forget
it
after
to-night
do
i
say
hark
the
birds
are
twittering
in
the
dew
outside
the
pale
early
sun-shafts
strike
over
the
moors
and
i
am
tired
to-morrow
night
i
will
finish
this
wrestle
with
my
own
folly
i
will
give
the
coup
de
grã¢ce
to
my
imagination
but
no
more
now
my
brain
is
not
calm
and
i
will
not
write
in
excitement
ii
wednesday
night
november
4th
margot
has
gone
to
bed
at
last
and
i
am
alone
this
has
been
a
horrible
day--horrible
but
i
will
not
dwell
upon
it
after
the
death
of
my
grandmother
i
went
back
to
school
again
but
willoughby
was
gone
and
he
could
not
forgive
me
he
wrote
to
me
once
or
twice
from
new
york
and
then
i
ceased
to
hear
from
him
he
died
out
of
my
life
his
affection
for
me
had
evidently
declined
from
the
day
when
he
took
it
into
his
head
that
i
was
only
a
money-grubber
like
the
rest
of
the
world
and
that
the
jew
instinct
had
developed
in
me
at
an
abnormally
early
age
i
let
him
go
what
did
it
matter
but
i
was
always
glad
that
i
had
been
cruel
on
the
day
my
grandmother
died
i
never
repented
of
what
i
did--never
if
i
had
i
might
be
happier
now
i
went
back
to
school
i
studied
played
got
into
mischief
and
out
of
it
again
like
other
boys
but
in
my
life
there
seemed
to
be
an
eternal
coldness
that
i
alone
perhaps
was
conscious
of
my
deed
of
cruelty
of
brutal
revenge
on
the
thing
that
had
never
done
me
injury
had
seared
my
soul
i
was
not
sorry
but
t
could
not
forget
and
sometimes
i
thought--how
ridiculous
it
looks
written
down--that
there
was
a
power
hidden
somewhere
which
could
not
forget
either
and
that
a
penalty
might
have
to
be
paid
because
a
creature
is
dumb
must
its
soul
die
when
it
dies
is
not
the
soul
perhaps--as
he
said--a
wanderer
through
many
bodies
but
if
i
did
not
kill
a
soul
as
i
killed
a
body
the
day
my
grandmother
died
where
is
that
soul
now
that
is
what
i
want
to
arrive
at
that
is
what
i
must
arrive
at
if
i
am
to
be
happy
i
went
back
to
school
and
i
passed
to
oxford
i
tasted
the
strange
unique
life
of
a
university
narrow
yet
pulsating
where
the
youth
that
is
so
green
and
springing
tries
to
arm
itself
for
the
battle
with
the
weapons
forged
by
the
dead
and
sharpened
by
the
more
elderly
among
the
living
i
did
well
there
and
i
passed
on
into
the
world
and
then
at
last
i
began
to
understand
the
value
of
my
inheritance
for
all
that
had
been
my
grandmotherâ€™s
was
now
mine
my
people
wished
me
to
marry
but
i
had
no
desire
to
fetter
myself
so
i
took
the
sponge
in
my
strong
young
hands
and
tried
to
squeeze
it
dry
and
i
did
not
know
that
i
was
sad--i
did
not
know
it
until
at
the
age
of
thirty-three
just
seventeen
years
after
my
grandmother
died
i
understood
the
sort
of
thing
happiness
is
of
course
it
was
love
that
brought
to
me
understanding
i
need
not
explain
that
i
had
often
played
on
love
now
love
began
to
play
on
me
i
trembled
at
the
harmonies
his
hands
evoked
i
met
a
young
girl
very
young
just
on
the
verge
of
life
and
of
womanhood
she
was
seventeen
when
i
first
saw
her
and
she
was
valsing
at
a
big
ball
in
london--her
first
ball
she
passed
me
in
the
crowd
of
dancers
and
i
noticed
her
as
she
was
a
debutante
her
dress
was
naturally
snow-white
there
was
no
touch
of
colour
about
it--not
a
flower
not
a
jewel
her
hair
was
the
palest
yellow
i
had
almost
ever
seen--the
colour
of
an
early
primrose
naturally
fluffy
it
nearly
concealed
the
white
riband
that
ran
through
it
and
clustered
in
tendrils
and
tiny
natural
curls
upon
her
neck
her
skin
was
whiter
than
ivory--a
clear
luminous
white
her
eyes
were
very
large
and
china-blue
in
colour
this
young
girl
dancing
passed
and
repassed
me
and
my
glance
rested
on
her
idly
even
cynically
for
she
seemed
so
happy
and
at
that
time
happiness
won
my
languid
wonder
if
ingenuously
exhibited
to
be
happy
seemed
almost
to
be
mindless
but
by
degrees
i
found
myself
watching
this
girl
and
more
closely
another
dance
began
she
joined
it
with
another
partner
but
she
seemed
just
as
pleased
with
him
as
with
her
former
one
she
would
not
let
him
pause
to
rest
she
kept
him
dancing
all
the
time
her
youth
and
freshness
spoken
in
that
gentle
compelling
i
grew
interested
in
her
even
acutely
so
she
seemed
to
me
like
the
spirit
of
youth
dancing
over
the
body
of
time
i
resolved
to
know
her
i
felt
weary
i
thought
she
might
revive
me
the
dance
drew
to
an
end
and
i
approached
my
hostess
pointed
the
girl
out
and
asked
for
an
introduction
her
name
was
margot
magendie
i
found
and
she
was
an
heiress
as
well
as
a
beauty
i
did
not
care
it
was
her
humanity
that
drew
me
nothing
else
but
strange
to
say
when
the
moment
for
the
introduction
arrived
and
i
stood
face
to
face
with
miss
magendie
i
felt
an
extraordinary
shrinking
from
her
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
it
but
my
blood
ran
cold
and
my
pulses
almost
ceased
to
beat
i
would
have
avoided
her
an
instinct
within
me
seemed
suddenly
to
cry
out
against
her
but
it
was
too
late
the
introduction
was
effected
her
hand
rested
on
my
arm
i
was
actually
trembling
she
did
not
appear
to
notice
it
the
band
played
a
valse
and
the
inexplicable
horror
that
had
seized
me
lost
itself
in
the
gay
music
it
never
returned
until
lately
i
seldom
enjoyed
a
valse
more
our
steps
suited
so
perfectly
and
her
obvious
childish
pleasure
communicated
itself
to
me
the
spirit
of
youth
in
her
knocked
on
my
rather
jaded
heart
and
i
opened
to
it
that
was
beautiful
and
strange
i
talked
with
her
and
i
felt
myself
younger
ingenuous
rather
than
cynical
inclined
even
to
a
radiant
though
foolish
optimism
she
was
very
natural
very
imperfect
in
worldly
education
full
of
fragmentary
but
decisive
views
on
life
quite
unabashed
in
giving
them
forth
quite
inconsiderate
in
summoning
my
adherence
to
them
and
then
presently
as
we
sat
in
a
dim
corridor
under
a
rosy
hanging
lamp
in
saying
something
she
looked
with
her
great
blue
eyes
right
into
my
face
some
very
faint
recollection
awoke
and
stirred
in
my
mind
â€œsurelyâ€
i
said
hesitatingly--â€œsurely
i
have
seen
you
before
it
seems
to
me
that
i
remember
your
eyesâ€
as
i
spoke
i
was
thinking
hard
chasing
the
vagrant
recollection
that
eluded
me
she
smiled
â€œyou
donâ€™t
remember
my
faceâ€
â€œno
not
at
allâ€
â€œnor
i
yours
if
we
had
seen
each
other
surely
we
should
recollect
itâ€
then
she
blushed
suddenly
realizing
that
her
words
implied
perhaps
more
than
she
had
meant
i
did
not
pay
the
obvious
compliment
those
blue
eyes
and
something
in
their
expression
moved
me
strangely
but
i
could
not
tell
why
when
i
said
good-bye
to
her
that
night
i
asked
to
be
allowed
to
call
she
assented
that
was
the
beginning
of
a
very
beautiful
courtship
which
gave
a
colour
to
life
a
music
to
existence
a
meaning
to
every
slightest
sensation
and
was
it
love
that
laid
to
sleep
recollection
that
sang
a
lullaby
to
awakening
horror
and
strewed
poppies
over
it
till
it
sighed
itself
into
slumber
was
it
love
that
drowned
my
mind
in
deep
and
charmed
waters
binding
the
strange
powers
that
every
mind
possesses
in
flowery
garlands
stronger
than
any
fetters
of
iron
was
it
love
that
calling
up
dreams
alienated
my
thoughts
from
their
search
after
reality
i
hardly
know
i
only
know
that
i
grew
to
love
margot
and
only
looked
for
love
in
her
blue
eyes
not
for
any
deed
of
the
past
that
might
be
mirrored
there
and
i
made
her
love
me
she
gave
her
childâ€™s
heart
to
my
keeping
with
a
perfect
confidence
that
only
a
perfect
affection
could
engender
she
did
love
me
then
no
circumstances
of
to-day
can
break
that
fact
under
their
hammers
she
did
love
me
and
it
is
the
knowledge
that
she
did
which
gives
so
much
of
fear
to
me
now
for
great
changes
in
the
human
mind
are
terrible
as
we
realize
them
we
realize
the
limitless
possibilities
of
sinister
deeds
that
lie
hidden
in
every
human
being
a
little
child
that
loves
a
doll
can
become
an
old
crafty
secret
murderer
how
horrible
and
perhaps
it
is
still
more
horrible
to
think
that
while
the
human
envelope
remains
totally
unchanged
every
word
of
the
letter
within
may
become
altered
and
a
message
of
peace
fade
into
a
sentence
of
death
margotâ€™s
face
is
the
same
face
now
as
it
was
when
i
married
her--scarcely
older
certainly
not
less
beautiful
only
the
expression
of
the
eyes
has
changed
for
we
were
married
after
a
year
of
love-making
which
never
tired
either
of
us
we
elected
to
bind
ourselves
to
fuse
the
two
into
one
we
went
abroad
for
the
honeymoon
and
instead
of
shortening
it
to
the
fashionable
fortnight
we
travelled
for
nearly
six
months
and
were
happy
all
the
time
boredom
never
set
in
margot
had
a
beautiful
mind
as
well
as
a
beautiful
face
she
softened
me
through
my
affection
the
current
of
my
life
began
to
set
in
a
different
direction
i
turned
the
pages
of
a
book
of
pity
and
of
death
more
beautiful
than
that
of
pierre
loti
i
could
hear
at
last
the
great
cry
for
sympathy
which
is
the
music
of
this
strange
suffering
world
and
listening
to
it
in
my
heart
there
rang
an
echo
the
cruelty
in
my
nature
seemed
to
shrivel
up
i
was
more
gentle
than
i
had
been
more
gentle
than
i
had
thought
i
could
ever
be
at
last
in
the
late
spring
we
started
for
home
we
stayed
for
a
week
in
london
and
then
we
travelled
north
margot
had
never
seen
her
future
home
had
never
even
been
in
cumberland
before
she
was
full
of
excitement
and
happiness
a
veritable
child
in
the
ready
and
ardent
expression
of
her
feelings
the
station
is
several
miles
from
the
house
and
is
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
when
the
train
pulled
up
at
the
wayside
platform
the
day
drew
towards
sunset
and
the
flat
levels
of
the
beach
shone
with
a
rich
liquid
amber
light
in
the
distance
the
sea
was
tossing
and
tumbling
whipped
into
foam
by
a
fresh
wind
the
isle
of
man
lay
far
away
dark
mysterious
under
a
stack
of
bellying
white
clouds
just
beginning
to
be
tinged
with
the
faintest
rose
margot
found
the
scene
beautiful
the
wind
life-giving
the
flat
sand-banks
the
shining
levels
even
the
dry
spiky
grass
that
fluttered
in
the
breeze
fascinating
and
refreshing
â€œi
feel
near
the
heart
of
nature
in
a
place
like
thisâ€
she
said
looking
up
at
a
seagull
that
hovered
over
the
little
platform
crying
to
the
wind
on
which
it
hung
the
train
stole
off
along
the
edge
of
the
sands
till
we
could
see
only
the
white
streamer
of
its
smoke
trailing
towards
the
sun
we
turned
away
from
the
sea
got
into
the
carriage
that
was
waiting
for
us
and
set
our
faces
inland
the
ocean
was
blotted
out
by
the
low
grass
and
heather-covered
banks
that
divided
the
fields
presently
we
plunged
into
woods
the
road
descended
sharply
a
village
an
abruptly
winding
river
sprang
into
sight
we
were
on
my
land
we
passed
the
inn
the
rainwood
arms
named
after
my
grandfatherâ€™s
family
the
people
whom
we
met
stared
curiously
and
saluted
in
rustic
fashion
margot
was
full
of
excitement
and
pleasure
and
talked
incessantly
holding
my
hand
tightly
in
hers
and
asking
a
thousand
questions
passing
through
the
village
we
mounted
a
hill
towards
a
thick
grove
of
trees
â€œthe
house
stands
among
themâ€
i
said
pointing
she
sprang
up
eagerly
in
the
carriage
to
find
it
but
it
was
hidden
we
dashed
through
the
gate
into
the
momentary
darkness
of
the
drive
emerged
between
great
green
lawns
and
drew
up
before
the
big
doorway
of
the
hall
i
looked
into
her
eyes
and
said
â€œwelcomeâ€
she
only
smiled
in
answer
i
would
not
let
her
enter
the
house
immediately
but
made
her
come
with
me
to
the
terrace
above
the
river
to
see
the
view
over
the
cumbrian
mountains
and
the
moors
of
eskdale
the
sky
was
very
clear
and
pale
but
over
styhead
the
clouds
were
boiling
up
the
screes
that
guard
ebon
wastwater
looked
grim
and
sad
margot
stood
beside
me
on
the
terrace
but
her
chatter
had
been
succeeded
by
silence
and
i
too
was
silent
for
the
moment
absorbed
in
contemplation
but
presently
i
turned
to
her
wishing
to
see
how
she
was
impressed
by
her
new
domain
she
was
not
looking
towards
the
river
and
the
hills
but
at
the
terrace
walk
itself
the
band
of
emerald
turf
that
bordered
it
the
stone
pots
full
of
flowers
the
winding
way
that
led
into
the
shrubbery
she
was
looking
at
these
intently
and
with
a
strangely
puzzled
almost
startled
expression
â€œhush
donâ€™t
speak
to
me
for
a
momentâ€
she
said
as
i
opened
my
lips
â€œdonâ€™t
i
want
to----
how
odd
this
isâ€
and
she
gazed
up
at
the
windows
of
the
house
at
the
creepers
that
climbed
its
walls
at
the
sloping
roof
and
the
irregular
chimney-stacks
her
lips
were
slightly
parted
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
an
inward
expression
that
told
me
she
was
struggling
with
forgetfulness
and
desired
recollection
i
was
silent
wondering
at
last
she
said
â€œronald
i
have
never
been
in
the
north
of
england
before
never
set
foot
in
cumberland
yet
i
seem
to
know
this
terrace
walk
those
very
flower-pots
the
garden
the
look
of
that
roof
those
chimneys
even
the
slanting
way
in
which
that
great
creeper
climbs
is
it
not--is
it
not
very
strangeâ€
she
gazed
up
at
me
and
in
her
blue
eyes
there
was
an
expression
almost
of
fear
i
smiled
down
on
her
â€œit
must
be
your
fancyâ€
i
said
â€œit
does
not
seem
soâ€
she
replied
â€œi
feel
as
if
i
had
been
here
before
and
often
or
for
a
long
timeâ€
she
paused
then
she
said
â€œdo
let
me
go
into
the
house
there
ought
to
be
a
room
there--a
room--i
seem
almost
to
see
it
come
let
us
go
inâ€
she
took
my
hand
and
drew
me
towards
the
hall
door
the
servants
were
carrying
in
the
luggage
and
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
confusion
and
noise
but
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
she
was
intent
on
something
i
could
not
tell
what
â€œdo
show
me
the
house
ronald--the
drawing-room
and--and--there
is
another
room
i
wish
to
seeâ€
â€œyou
shall
see
them
all
dearâ€
i
said
â€œyou
are
excited
it
is
natural
enough
this
is
the
drawing-roomâ€
she
glanced
round
it
hastily
â€œand
now
the
othersâ€
she
exclaimed
i
took
her
to
the
dining-room
the
library
and
the
various
apartments
on
the
ground-floor
she
scarcely
looked
at
them
when
we
had
finished
exploring
â€œare
these
allâ€
she
asked
with
a
wavering
accent
of
disappointment
â€œallâ€
i
answered
â€œthen--show
me
the
rooms
upstairsâ€
we
ascended
the
shallow
oak
steps
and
passed
first
into
the
apartment
in
which
my
grandmother
had
died
it
had
been
done
up
since
then
refurnished
and
almost
completely
altered
only
the
wide
fireplace
with
its
brass
dogs
and
its
heavy
oaken
mantelpiece
had
been
left
untouched
margot
glanced
hastily
round
then
she
walked
up
to
the
fireplace
and
drew
a
long
breath
â€œthere
ought
to
be
a
fire
hereâ€
she
said
â€œbut
it
is
summerâ€
i
answered
wondering
â€œand
a
chair
thereâ€
she
went
on
in
a
curious
low
voice
indicating--i
think
now
or
is
it
my
imagination--the
very
spot
where
my
grandmother
was
wont
to
sit
â€œyes--i
seem
to
remember
and
yet
not
to
rememberâ€
she
looked
at
me
and
her
white
brows
were
knit
suddenly
she
said
â€œronald
i
donâ€™t
think
i
like
this
room
there
is
something--i
donâ€™t
know--i
donâ€™t
think
i
could
sit
here
and
i
seem
to
remember--something
about
it
as
i
did
about
the
terrace
what
can
it
meanâ€
â€œit
means
that
you
are
tired
and
overexcited
darling
your
nerves
are
too
highly
strung
and
nerves
play
us
strange
tricks
come
to
your
own
room
and
take
off
your
things
and
when
you
have
had
some
tea
you
will
be
all
right
againâ€
yes
i
was
fool
enough
to
believe
that
tea
was
the
panacea
for
an
undreamed-of
a
then
unimaginable
evil
i
thought
margot
was
simply
an
overtired
and
imaginative
child
that
evening
if
i
could
believe
so
now
we
went
up
into
her
boudoir
and
had
tea
and
she
grew
more
like
herself
but
several
times
that
night
i
observed
her
looking
puzzled
and
thoughtful
and
a
certain
expression
of
anxiety
shone
in
her
blue
eyes
that
was
new
to
them
then
but
i
thought
nothing
of
it
and
i
was-happy
two
or
three
days
passed
and
mar-got
did
not
again
refer
to
her
curious
sensation
of
pre-knowledge
of
the
house
and
garden
i
fancied
there
was
a
slight
alteration
in
her
manner
that
was
all
she
seemed
a
little
restless
her
vivacity
flagged
now
and
then
she
was
more
willing
to
be
alone
than
she
had
been
but
we
were
old
married
folk
now
and
could
not
be
always
in
each
otherâ€™s
sight
i
had
a
great
many
people
connected
with
the
estate
to
see
and
had
to
gather
up
the
tangled
threads
of
many
affairs
the
honeymoon
was
over
of
course
we
could
not
always
be
together
still
i
should
have
wished
margot
to
desire
it
and
i
could
not
hide
from
myself
that
now
and
then
she
scarcely
concealed
a
slight
impatience
to
be
left
in
solitude
this
troubled
me
but
only
a
little
for
she
was
generally
as
fond
as
ever
that
evening
however
an
incident
occurred
which
rendered
me
decidedly
uneasy
and
made
me
wonder
if
my
wife
were
not
inclined
to
that
curse
of
highly-strung
women--hysteria
i
had
been
riding
over
the
moors
to
visit
a
tenant-farmer
who
lived
at
some
distance
and
did
not
return
until
twilight
dismounting
i
let
myself
into
the
house
traversed
the
hall
and
ascended
the
stairs
as
i
wore
spurs
and
the
steps
were
of
polished
oak
and
uncarpeted
i
walked
noisily
enough
to
warn
anyone
of
my
approach
i
was
passing
the
door
of
the
room
that
had
been
my
grandmotherâ€™s
sitting-room
when
i
noticed
that
it
stood
open
the
house
was
rather
dark
and
the
interior
was
dim
enough
but
i
could
see
a
figure
in
a
white
dress
moving
about
inside
i
recognised
margot
and
wondered
what
she
was
doing
but
her
movements
were
so
singular
that
instead
of
speaking
to
her
i
stood
in
the
doorway
and
watched
her
she
was
walking
with
a
very
peculiar
stealthy
step
around
the
room
not
as
if
she
were
looking
for
anything
but
merely
as
if
she
were
restless
or
ill
at
ease
but
what
struck
me
forcibly
was
this
that
there
was
something
curiously
animal
in
her
movements
seen
thus
in
a
dim
half-light
that
only
partially
revealed
her
to
me
i
had
never
seen
a
woman
walk
in
that
strangely
wild
yet
soft
way
before
there
was
something
uncanny
about
it
that
rendered
me
extremely
discomforted
yet
i
was
quite
fascinated
and
rooted
to
the
ground
i
cannot
tell
how
long
i
stood
there
i
was
so
completely
absorbed
in
the
passion
of
the
gazer
that
the
passage
of
time
did
not
concern
me
in
the
least
i
was
as
one
assisting
at
a
strange
spectacle
this
white
thing
moving
in
the
dark
did
not
suggest
my
wife
to
me
although
it
was
she
i
might
have
been
watching
an
animal
vague
yet
purposeful
of
mind
tracing
out
some
hidden
thing
following
out
some
instinct
quite
foreign
to
humanity
i
remember
that
presently
i
involuntarily
clasped
my
hands
together
and
felt
that
they
were
very
cold
perspiration
broke
out
on
my
face
i
was
painfully
unnaturally
moved
and
a
violent
desire
to
be
away
from
this
white
moving
thing
came
over
me
walking
as
softly
as
i
could
i
went
to
my
dressing-room
shut
the
door
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
i
never
remember
to
have
felt
thoroughly
unnerved
before
but
now
i
found
myself
actually
shaken
palsied
i
could
understand
how
deadly
a
thing
fear
is
i
lit
a
candle
hastily
and
as
i
did
so
a
knock
came
to
the
door
margotâ€™s
voice
said
â€œmay
i
come
inâ€
i
felt
unable
to
reply
so
i
got
up
and
admitted
her
she
entered
smiling
and
looking
such
a
child
so
innocent
so
tender
that
i
almost
laughed
aloud
that
i
a
man
should
have
been
frightened
by
a
child
in
a
white
dress
just
because
the
twilight
cast
a
phantom
atmosphere
around
her
i
held
her
in
my
arms
and
i
gazed
into
her
blue
eyes
she
looked
down
but
still
smiled
â€œwhere
have
you
been
and
what
have
you
been
doingâ€
i
asked
gaily
she
answered
that
she
had
been
in
the
drawing-room
since
tea-time
â€œyou
came
here
straight
from
the
drawing-roomâ€
i
said
she
replied
â€œyesâ€
then
with
an
indifferent
air
which
hid
real
anxiety
i
said
â€œby
the
way
margot
have
you
been
into
that
room
again--the
room
you
fancied
you
recollectedâ€
â€œno
neverâ€
she
answered
withdrawing
herself
from
my
arms
â€œi
donâ€™t
wish
to
go
there
make
haste
ronald
and
dress
it
is
nearly
dinner-time
and
i
am
readyâ€
and
she
turned
and
left
me
she
had
told
me
a
lie
all
my
feelings
of
uneasiness
and
discomfort
returned
tenfold
that
evening
was
the
most
wretched
one
the
only
wretched
one
i
had
ever
spent
with
her

i
am
tired
of
writing
i
will
continue
my
task
to-morrow
it
takes
me
longer
than
i
anticipated
yet
even
to
tell
everything
to
myself
brings
me
some
comfort
man
must
express
himself
and
despair
must
find
a
voice
iii
thursday
night
december
5th
that
lie
awoke
in
me
suspicion
of
the
child
i
had
married
i
began
to
doubt
her
yet
never
ceased
to
love
her
she
had
all
my
heart
and
must
have
it
till
the
end
but
the
calm
of
love
was
to
be
succeeded
by
loveâ€™s
tumult
and
agony
a
strangeness
was
creeping
over
margot
it
was
as
if
she
took
a
thin
veil
in
her
hands
and
drew
it
over
and
all
around
her
till
the
outlines
i
had
known
were
slightly
blurred
her
disposition
which
had
been
so
clear
cut
so
sharply
beautifully
defined
standing
out
in
its
innocent
glory
for
all
men
to
see
seemed
to
withdraw
itself
as
if
a
dawning
necessity
for
secrecy
had
arisen
a
thin
crust
of
reserve
began
to
subtly
overspread
her
every
act
and
expression
she
thought
now
before
she
spoke
she
thought
before
she
looked
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
becoming
a
slightly
different
person
the
change
i
mean
to
imply
is
very
difficult
to
describe
it
was
not
abrupt
enough
to
startle
but
i
could
feel
it
slight
though
it
was
have
you
seen
the
first
flat
film
of
waveless
water
sent
by
the
incoming
tides
of
the
sea
crawling
silently
up
over
the
wrinkled
brown
sand
and
filling
the
tiny
ruts
till
diminutive
hills
and
valleys
are
all
one
smooth
surface
so
it
was
with
margot
a
tide
flowed
over
her
character
a
waveless
tide
of
reserve
the
hills
and
valleys
which
i
loved
disappeared
from
my
ken
behind
the
old
sweet
smile
the
old
frank
expression
my
wife
was
shrinking
down
to
hide
herself
as
one
escaping
from
pursuit
hides
behind
a
barrier
when
one
human
being
knows
another
very
intimately
and
all
the
barricades
that
divide
soul
from
soul
have
been
broken
down
it
is
difficult
to
set
them
up
again
without
noise
and
dust
and
the
sound
of
thrust-in
bolts
and
the
tap
of
the
hammer
that
drives
in
the
nails
it
is
difficult
but
not
impossible
barricades
can
be
raised
noiselessly
soundless
bolts--that
keep
out
the
soul--be
pushed
home
the
black
gauze
veil
that
blots
out
the
scene
drops
and
when
it
is
raised--if
ever--the
scene
is
changed
the
real
margot
was
receding
from
me
i
felt
it
with
an
impotence
of
despair
that
was
benumbing
yet
i
could
not
speak
of
it
for
at
first
i
could
hardly
tell
if
she
knew
of
what
was
taking
place
indeed
at
this
moment
in
thinking
it
over
i
do
not
believe
that
for
some
time
she
had
any
definite
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
she
was
growing
to
love
me
less
passionately
than
of
old
in
acts
she
was
not
changed
that
was
the
strange
part
of
the
matter
her
kisses
were
warm
but
i
believed
them
premeditated
she
clasped
my
hand
in
hers
but
now
there
was
more
mechanism
than
magic
in
that
act
of
tenderness
impulse
failed
within
her
and
she
had
been
all
impulse
did
she
know
it
at
that
time
i
wondered
believing
that
she
did
not
know
she
was
changing
i
was
at
the
greatest
pains
to
guard
my
conduct
lest
i
should
implant
the
suspicion
that
might
hasten
what
i
feared
i
remained
desperately
the
same
as
ever
and
so
of
course
was
not
the
same
for
a
deed
done
defiantly
bears
little
resemblance
to
a
deed
done
naturally
i
was
always
considering
what
i
should
say
how
i
should
act
even
how
i
should
look
to
live
now
was
sedulous
instead
of
easy
effort
took
the
place
of
simplicity
my
wife
and
i
were
gazing
furtively
at
each
other
through
the
eye-holes
of
masks
i
knew
it
did
she
at
that
time
i
never
ceased
to
wonder
of
one
thing
i
was
certain
however--that
margot
began
to
devise
excuses
for
being
left
alone
when
we
first
came
home
she
could
hardly
endure
me
out
of
her
sight
now
she
grew
to
appreciate
solitude
this
was
a
terrible
danger
signal
and
i
could
not
fail
to
so
regard
it
yet
something
within
me
held
me
back
from
speaking
out
i
made
no
comment
on
the
change
that
deepened
day
by
day
but
i
watched
my
wife
furtively
with
a
concentration
of
attention
that
sometimes
left
me
physically
exhausted
i
felt
too
at
length
that
i
was
growing
morbid
that
suspicion
coloured
my
mind
and
caused
me
perhaps
to
put
a
wrong
interpretation
on
many
of
her
actions
to
exaggerate
and
misconstrue
the
most
simple
things
she
did
i
began
to
believe
her
every
look
premeditated
even
if
she
kissed
me
i
thought
she
did
it
with
a
purpose
if
she
smiled
up
at
me
as
of
old
i
fancied
the
smile
to
be
only
a
concealment
of
its
opposite
by
degrees
we
became
shy
of
each
other
we
were
like
uncongenial
intimates
forced
to
occupy
the
same
house
forced
into
a
fearful
knowledge
of
each
otherâ€™s
personal
habits
while
we
knew
nothing
of
the
thoughts
that
make
up
the
true
lives
of
individuals
and
then
another
incident
occurred
a
pendant
to
the
incident
of
margotâ€™s
strange
denied
visit
to
the
room
she
affected
to
fear
it
was
one
night
one
deep
dark
night
of
the
autumn--a
season
to
affect
even
a
cheerful
mind
and
incline
it
towards
melancholy
margot
and
i
were
now
often
silent
when
we
were
together
that
evening
towards
nine
a
dull
steady
rain
set
in
i
remember
i
heard
it
on
the
window-panes
as
we
sat
in
the
drawing-room
after
dinner
and
remarked
on
it
saying
to
her
that
if
it
continued
for
two
or
three
days
she
might
chance
to
see
the
floods
out
and
that
fishermen
would
descend
upon
us
by
the
score
i
did
not
obtain
much
response
from
her
the
dreariness
of
the
weather
seemed
to
affect
her
spirits
she
took
up
a
book
presently
and
appeared
to
read
but
once
in
glancing
up
suddenly
from
my
newspaper
i
thought
i
caught
her
gaze
fixed
fearfully
upon
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
looking
furtively
at
me
with
an
absolute
terror
i
was
so
much
affected
that
i
made
some
excuse
for
leaving
the
room
went
down
to
my
den
lit
a
cigar
and
walked
uneasily
up
and
down
listening
to
the
rain
on
the
window
at
ten
margot
came
in
to
tell
me
she
was
going
to
bed
i
wished
her
good-night
tenderly
but
as
i
held
her
slim
body
a
moment
in
my
arms
i
felt
that
she
began
to
tremble
i
let
her
go
and
she
slipped
from
the
room
with
the
soft
cushioned
step
that
was
habitual
with
her
and
strangely
enough
my
thoughts
recurred
to
the
day
long
ago
when
i
first
held
the
great
white
cat
on
my
knees
and
felt
its
body
shrink
from
my
touch
with
a
nameless
horror
the
uneasy
movement
of
the
woman
recalled
to
me
so
strongly
and
so
strangely
the
uneasy
movement
of
the
animal
i
lit
a
second
cigar
it
was
near
midnight
when
it
was
smoked
out
and
i
turned
down
the
lamp
and
went
softly
up
to
bed
i
undressed
in
the
room
adjoining
my
wifeâ€™s
and
then
stole
into
hers
she
was
sleeping
in
the
wide
white
bed
rather
uneasily
and
as
i
leaned
over
her
shading
the
candle
flame
with
my
outspread
hand
she
muttered
some
broken
words
that
i
could
not
catch
i
had
never
heard
her
talk
in
her
dreams
before
i
lay
down
gently
at
her
side
and
extinguished
the
candle
but
sleep
did
not
come
to
me
the
dull
dead
silence
weighed
upon
instead
of
soothing
me
my
mind
was
terribly
alive
in
a
ferment
and
the
contrast
between
my
own
excitement
and
the
hushed
peace
of
my
environment
was
painful
was
almost
unbearable
i
wished
that
a
wind
from
the
mountains
were
beating
against
the
window-panes
and
the
rain
lashing
the
house
in
fury
the
black
calm
around
was
horrible
unnatural
the
drizzling
rain
was
now
so
small
that
i
could
not
even
hear
its
patter
when
i
strained
my
ears
margot
had
ceased
to
mutter
and
lay
perfectly
still
how
i
longed
to
be
able
to
read
the
soul
hidden
in
her
sleeping
body
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
the
mind
which
i
had
once
understood
so
perfectly
it
is
so
horrible
that
we
can
never
open
the
human
envelope
take
out
the
letter
and
seize
with
our
eyes
upon
its
every
word
margot
slept
with
all
her
secrets
safeguarded
although
she
was
unconscious
no
longer
watchful
on
the
alert
she
was
so
silent
even
her
quiet
breathing
not
reaching
my
ear
that
i
felt
impelled
to
stretch
out
my
hand
beneath
the
coverlet
and
touch
hers
ever
so
softly
i
did
so
her
hand
was
instantly
and
silently
withdrawn
she
was
awake
then
â€œmargotâ€
i
said
â€œdid
i
disturb
youâ€
there
was
no
answer
the
movement
followed
by
the
silence
affected
me
very
disagreeably
i
lit
the
candle
and
looked
at
her
she
was
lying
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
bed
with
her
blue
eyes
closed
her
lips
were
slightly
parted
i
could
hear
her
steady
breathing
yet
was
she
really
sleeping
i
bent
lower
over
her
and
as
i
did
so
a
slight
involuntary
movement
akin
to
what
we
call
a
shudder
ran
through
her
body
i
recoiled
from
the
bed
an
impotent
anger
seized
me
could
it
be
that
my
presence
was
becoming
so
hateful
to
my
wife
that
even
in
sleep
her
body
trembled
when
i
drew
near
it
or
was
this
slumber
feigned
i
could
not
tell
but
i
felt
it
impossible
at
that
moment
to
remain
in
the
room
i
returned
to
my
own
dressed
and
descended
the
stairs
to
the
door
opening
on
to
the
terrace
i
felt
a
longing
to
be
out
in
the
air
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
was
stifling
was
it
coming
to
this
then
did
i
a
man
shrink
with
a
fantastic
cowardice
from
a
woman
i
loved
the
latent
cruelty
began
to
stir
within
me
the
tyrant
spirit
which
a
strong
love
sometimes
evokes
i
had
been
margotâ€™s
slave
almost
my
affection
had
brought
me
to
her
feet
had
kept
me
there
so
long
as
she
loved
me
i
was
content
to
be
her
captive
knowing
she
was
mine
but
a
change
in
her
attitude
toward
me
might
rouse
the
master
in
my
nature
there
was
a
certain
brutality
a
savagery
which
i
had
never
wholly
slain
although
margot
had
softened
me
wonderfully
by
her
softness
had
brought
me
to
gentleness
by
her
tenderness
the
boy
of
years
ago
had
developed
toward
better
things
but
he
was
not
dead
in
me
i
felt
that
as
i
walked
up
and
down
the
terrace
through
the
night
in
a
wild
meditation
if
my
love
could
not
hold
margot
my
strength
should
i
drew
in
a
long
breath
of
the
wet
night
air
and
i
opened
my
shoulders
as
if
shaking
off
an
oppression
my
passion
for
margot
had
not
yet
drawn
me
down
to
weakness
it
had
raised
me
up
to
strength
the
faint
fear
of
her
which
i
had
felt
almost
without
knowing
it
more
than
once
died
within
me
the
desire
of
the
conqueror
elevated
me
there
was
something
for
me
to
win
my
paralysis
passed
away
and
i
turned
toward
the
house
and
now
a
strange
thing
happened
i
walked
into
the
dark
hall
closed
the
outer
door
shutting
out
the
dull
murmur
of
the
night
and
felt
in
my
pocket
for
my
matchbox
it
was
not
there
i
must
inadvertently
have
laid
it
down
in
my
dressing-room
and
left
it
i
searched
about
in
the
darkness
on
the
hall
table
but
could
find
no
light
there
was
nothing
for
it
then
but
to
feel
my
way
upstairs
as
best
i
could
i
started
keeping
my
hand
against
the
wall
to
guide
me
i
gained
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
began
to
traverse
the
landing
still
with
my
hand
upon
the
wall
to
reach
my
dressing-room
i
had
to
pass
the
apartment
which
had
been
my
grandmotherâ€™s
sitting-room
when
i
reached
it
instead
of
sliding
along
a
closed
door
as
i
had
anticipated
my
hand
dropped
into
vacancy
the
door
was
wide
open
it
had
been
shut
like
all
the
other
doors
in
the
house
when
i
had
descended
the
stairs--shut
and
locked
as
it
always
was
at
night-time
why
was
it
open
now
i
paused
in
the
darkness
and
then
an
impulse
seized
me
to
walk
forward
into
the
room
i
advanced
a
step
but
as
i
did
so
a
horrible
low
cry
broke
upon
my
ears
out
of
the
darkness
it
came
from
immediately
in
front
of
me
and
sounded
like
an
expression
of
the
most
abject
fear
my
feet
rooted
themselves
to
the
ground
â€œwhoâ€™s
thereâ€
i
asked
there
came
no
answer
i
listened
for
a
moment
but
did
not
hear
the
minutest
sound
the
desire
for
light
was
overpowering
i
generally
did
my
writing
in
this
room
and
knew
the
exact
whereabouts
of
everything
in
it
i
knew
that
on
the
writing-table
there
was
a
silver
box
containing
wax
matches
it
lay
on
the
left
of
my
desk
i
moved
another
step
forward
there
was
the
sound
of
a
slight
rustle
as
if
someone
shrank
back
as
i
advanced
i
laid
my
hand
quickly
on
the
box
opened
it
and
struck
a
light
the
room
was
vaguely
illuminated
i
saw
something
white
at
the
far
end
against
the
wall
i
put
the
match
to
a
candle
the
white
thing
was
margot
she
was
in
her
dressing-gown
and
was
crouched
up
in
an
angle
of
the
wall
as
far
away
from
where
i
stood
as
possible
her
blue
eyes
were
wide
open
and
fixed
upon
me
with
an
expression
of
such
intense
and
hideous
fear
in
them
that
i
almost
cried
out
â€œmargot
what
is
the
matterâ€
i
said
â€œare
you
illâ€
she
made
no
reply
her
face
terrified
me
â€œwhat
is
it
margotâ€
i
cried
in
a
loud
almost
harsh
voice
determined
to
rouse
her
from
this
horrible
unnatural
silence
â€œwhat
are
you
doing
hereâ€
i
moved
towards
her
i
stretched
out
my
hands
and
seized
her
as
i
did
so
a
sort
of
sob
burst
from
her
her
hands
were
cold
and
trembling
â€œwhat
is
it
what
has
frightened
youâ€
i
reiterated
at
last
she
spoke
in
a
low
voice
â€œyou--you
looked
so
strange
so--so
cruel
as
you
came
inâ€
she
said
â€œstrange
cruel
but
you
could
not
see
me
it
was
darkâ€
i
answered
â€œdarkâ€
she
said
â€œyes
until
i
lit
the
candle
and
you
cried
out
when
i
was
only
in
the
doorway
you
could
not
see
me
thereâ€
â€œwhy
not
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
itâ€
she
murmured
still
trembling
violently
â€œyou
can
see
me
in
the
darkâ€
â€œof
courseâ€
she
said
â€œi
donâ€™t
understand
what
you
mean
of
course
i
can
see
you
when
you
are
there
before
my
eyesâ€
â€œbut----â€
i
began
and
then
her
obvious
and
complete
surprise
at
my
questions
stopped
them
i
still
held
her
hands
in
mine
and
their
extreme
coldness
roused
me
to
the
remembrance
that
she
was
unclothed
â€œyou
will
be
ill
if
you
stay
hereâ€
i
said
â€œcome
back
to
your
roomâ€
she
said
nothing
and
i
led
her
back
waited
while
she
got
into
bed
and
then
placing
the
candle
on
the
dressing-table
sat
down
in
a
chair
by
her
side
the
strong
determination
to
take
prompt
action
to
come
to
an
explanation
to
end
these
dreary
mysteries
of
mind
and
conduct
was
still
upon
me
i
did
not
think
of
the
strange
hour
i
did
not
care
that
the
night
was
gliding
on
towards
dawn
i
was
self-absorbed
i
was
beyond
ordinary
considerations
yet
i
did
not
speak
immediately
i
was
trying
to
be
quite
calm
trying
to
think
of
the
best
line
for
me
to
take
so
much
might
depend
upon
our
mere
words
now
at
length
i
said
laying
my
hand
upon
hers
which
was
outside
the
coverlet
â€œmargot
what
were
you
doing
in
that
room
at
such
a
strange
hour
why
were
you
thereâ€
she
hesitated
obviously
then
she
answered
not
looking
at
me
â€œi
missed
you
i
thought
you
might
be
there--writingâ€
â€œbut
you
were
in
the
darkâ€
â€œi
thought
you
would
have
a
lightâ€
i
knew
by
her
manner
that
she
was
not
telling
me
the
truth
but
i
went
on
quietly
â€œif
you
expected
me
why
did
you
cry
out
when
i
came
to
the
doorâ€
she
tried
to
draw
her
hand
away
but
i
held
it
fast
closing
my
fingers
upon
it
with
even
brutal
strength
â€œwhy
did
you
cry
outâ€
â€œyou--you
looked
so
strange
so
cruelâ€
â€œso
cruelâ€
â€œyes
you
frightened
me--you
frightened
me
horriblyâ€
she
began
suddenly
to
sob
like
one
completely
overstrained
i
lifted
her
up
in
the
bed
put
my
arms
round
her
and
made
her
lean
against
me
i
was
strangely
moved
â€œi
frightened
you
how
can
that
beâ€
i
said
trying
to
control
a
passion
of
mingled
love
and
anger
that
filled
my
breast
â€œyou
know
that
i
love
you
you
must
know
that
in
all
our
short
married
life
have
i
ever
been
even
momentarily
unkind
to
you
let
us
be
frank
with
one
another
our
lives
have
changed
lately
one
of
us
has
altered
you
cannot
say
that
it
is
iâ€
she
only
continued
to
sob
bitterly
in
my
arms
i
held
her
closer
â€œlet
us
be
frank
with
one
anotherâ€
i
went
on
â€œfor
godâ€™s
sake
let
us
have
no
barriers
between
us
margot
look
into
my
eyes
and
tell
me--are
you
growing
tired
of
meâ€
she
turned
her
head
away
but
i
spoke
more
sternly
â€œyou
shall
be
truthful
i
will
have
no
more
subterfuge
look
me
in
the
face
you
did
love
me
onceâ€
â€œyes
yesâ€
she
whispered
in
a
choked
voice
â€œwhat
have
i
done
then
to
alienate
you
have
i
ever
hurt
you
ever
shown
a
lack
of
sympathy
ever
neglected
youâ€
â€œnever--neverâ€
â€œyet
you
have
changed
to
me
since--since----â€
i
paused
a
moment
trying
to
recall
when
i
had
first
noticed
her
altered
demeanour
she
interrupted
me
â€œit
has
all
come
upon
me
in
this
houseâ€
she
sobbed
â€œoh
what
is
it
what
does
it
all
mean
if
i
could
understand
a
little--only
a
little--it
would
not
be
so
bad
but
this
nightmare
this
thing
that
seems
such
a
madness
of
the
intellect----â€
her
voice
broke
and
ceased
her
tears
burst
forth
afresh
such
mingled
fear
passion
and
a
sort
of
strange
latent
irritation
i
had
never
seen
before
â€œit
is
a
madness
indeedâ€
i
said
and
a
sense
almost
of
outrage
made
my
voice
hard
and
cold
â€œi
have
not
deserved
such
treatment
at
your
handsâ€
â€œi
will
not
yield
to
itâ€
she
said
with
a
sort
of
desperation
suddenly
throwing
her
arms
around
me
â€œi
will
not--i
will
notâ€
i
was
strangely
puzzled
i
was
torn
with
conflicting
feelings
love
and
anger
grappled
at
my
heart
but
i
only
held
her
and
did
not
speak
until
she
grew
obviously
calmer
the
paroxysm
seemed
passing
away
then
i
said
â€œi
cannot
understandâ€
â€œnor
iâ€
she
answered
with
a
directness
that
had
been
foreign
to
her
of
late
but
that
was
part
and
parcel
of
her
real
beautiful
nature
â€œi
cannot
understand
i
only
know
there
is
a
change
in
me
or
in
you
to
me
and
that
i
cannot
help
it
or
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
help
it
sometimes
i
feel--do
not
be
angry
i
will
try
to
tell
you--a
physical
fear
of
you
of
your
touch
of
your
clasp
a
fear
such
as
an
animal
might
feel
towards
the
master
who
had
beaten
it
i
tremble
then
at
your
approach
when
you
are
near
me
i
feel
cold
oh
so
cold
and--and
anxious
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
apprehensive
oh
i
am
hurting
youâ€
i
suppose
i
must
have
winced
at
her
words
and
she
is
quick
to
observe
â€œgo
onâ€
i
said
â€œdo
not
spare
me
tell
me
everything
it
is
madness
indeed
but
we
may
kill
it
when
we
both
know
itâ€
â€œoh
if
we
couldâ€
she
cried
with
a
poignancy
which
was
heart-breaking
to
hear
â€œif
we
couldâ€
â€œdo
you
doubt
our
abilityâ€
i
said
trying
to
be
patient
and
calm
â€œyou
are
unreasoning
like
all
women
be
sensible
for
a
moment
you
do
me
a
wrong
in
cherishing
these
feelings
i
have
the
capacity
for
cruelty
in
me
i
may
have
been--i
have
been--cruel
in
the
past
but
never
to
you
you
have
no
right
to
treat
me
as
you
have
done
lately
if
you
examine
your
feelings
and
compare
them
with
facts
you
will
see
their
absurdityâ€
â€œbutâ€
she
interposed
with
a
womanâ€™s
fatal
quickness
â€œthat
will
not
do
away
with
their
realityâ€
â€œit
must
look
into
their
faces
until
they
fade
like
ghosts
seen
only
between
light
and
darkness
they
are
founded
upon
nothing
they
are
bred
without
father
or
mother
they
are
hysterical
they
are
wicked
think
a
little
of
me
you
are
not
going
to
be
conquered
by
a
chimera
to
allow
a
phantom
created
by
your
imagination
to
ruin
the
happiness
that
has
been
so
beautiful
you
will
not
do
that
you
dare
notâ€
she
only
answered
â€œif
i
can
help
itâ€
a
passionate
anger
seized
me
a
fury
at
my
impotence
against
this
child
i
pushed
her
almost
roughly
from
my
arms
â€œand
i
have
married
this
womanâ€
i
cried
bitterly
i
got
up
margot
had
ceased
crying
now
and
her
face
was
very
white
and
calm
it
looked
rigid
in
the
faint
candle-light
that
shone
across
the
bed
â€œdo
not
be
angryâ€
she
said
â€œwe
are
controlled
by
something
inside
of
us
there
are
powers
in
us
that
we
cannot
fight
againstâ€
â€œthere
is
nothing
we
cannot
fight
againstâ€
i
said
passionately
â€œthe
doctrine
of
predestination
is
the
devilâ€™s
own
doctrine
it
is
the
doctrine
set
up
by
the
sinner
to
excuse
his
sin
it
is
the
cowardâ€™s
doctrine
understand
me
margot
i
love
you
but
i
am
not
a
weak
fool
there
must
be
an
end
of
this
folly
perhaps
you
are
playing
with
me
acting
like
a
girl
testing
me
let
us
have
no
more
of
itâ€
she
said
â€œi
only
do
what
i
mustâ€
her
tone
turned
me
cold
her
set
face
frightened
me
and
angered
me
for
there
was
a
curious
obstinacy
in
it
i
left
the
room
abruptly
and
did
not
return
that
night
i
had
no
sleep
i
am
not
a
coward
but
i
find
that
i
am
inclined
to
fear
that
which
fears
me
i
dread
an
animal
that
always
avoids
me
silently
more
than
an
animal
that
actually
attacks
me
the
thing
that
runs
from
me
makes
me
shiver
the
thing
that
creeps
away
when
i
come
near
wakes
my
uneasiness
at
this
time
there
rose
up
in
me
a
strange
feeling
towards
margot
the
white
fair
child
i
had
married
was
at
moments--only
at
moments--horrible
to
me
i
felt
disposed
to
shun
her
something
within
cried
out
against
her
long
ago
at
the
instant
of
our
introduction
an
unreasoning
sensation
that
could
only
be
called
dread
had
laid
hold
upon
me
that
dread
returned
from
the
night
of
our
explanation
returned
deepened
and
added
to
it
prompted
me
to
a
suggestion
which
i
had
no
sooner
made
than
i
regretted
it
on
the
morning
following
i
told
margot
that
in
future
we
had
better
occupy
separate
rooms
she
assented
quietly
but
i
thought
a
furtive
expression
of
relief
stole
for
a
moment
into
her
face
i
was
deeply
angered
with
her
and
with
myself
yet
now
that
i
knew
beyond
question
my
wifeâ€™s
physical
terror
of
me
i
was-half
afraid
of
her
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
lie
long
hours
by
her
side
in
the
darkness
by
the
side
of
a
woman
who
was
shrinking
from
me
who
was
watching
me
when
i
could
not
see
her
the
idea
made
my
very
flesh
creep
yet
i
hated
myself
for
this
shrinking
of
the
body
and
sometimes
hated
her
for
rousing
it
a
hideous
struggle
was
going
on
within
me--a
struggle
between
love
and
impotent
anger
and
despair
between
the
lover
and
the
master
for
i
am
one
of
the
old-fashioned
men
who
think
that
a
husband
ought
to
be
master
of
his
wife
as
well
as
of
his
house
how
could
i
be
master
of
a
woman
i
secretly
feared
my
knowledge
of
myself
spurred
me
through
acute
irritation
almost
to
the
verge
of
madness
all
calm
was
gone
i
was
alternately
gentle
to
my
wife
and
almost
ferocious
towards
her
ready
to
fall
at
her
feet
and
worship
her
or
to
seize
her
and
treat
her
with
physical
violence
i
only
restrained
myself
by
an
effort
my
variations
of
manner
did
not
seem
to
affect
her
indeed
it
sometimes
struck
me
that
she
feared
me
more
when
i
was
kind
to
her
than
when
i
was
harsh
and
i
knew
by
a
thousand
furtive
indications
that
her
horror
of
me
was
deepening
day
by
day
i
believe
she
could
hardly
bring
herself
to
be
in
a
room
alone
with
me
especially
after
nightfall
one
evening
when
we
were
dining
the
butler
after
placing
dessert
upon
the
table
moved
to
leave
us
she
turned
white
and
as
he
reached
the
door
half
rose
and
called
him
back
in
a
sharp
voice
â€œsymondsâ€
she
said
â€œyes
maâ€™amâ€
â€œyou
are
goingâ€
the
fellow
looked
surprised
â€œcan
i
get
you
anything
maâ€™amâ€
she
glanced
at
me
with
an
indescribable
uneasiness
then
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
with
an
effort
and
pressed
her
lips
together
â€œnoâ€
she
said
as
the
man
went
out
and
shut
the
door
she
looked
at
me
again
from
under
her
eyelids
and
finally
her
eyes
travelled
from
me
to
a
small
thin-bladed
knife
used
for
cutting
oranges
that
lay
near
her
plate
and
fixed
themselves
on
it
she
put
out
her
hand
stealthily
drew
it
towards
her
and
kept
her
hand
over
it
on
the
table
i
took
an
orange
from
a
dish
in
front
of
me
â€œmargotâ€
i
said
â€œwill
you
pass
me
that
fruit-knifeâ€
she
obviously
hesitated
â€œgive
me
that
knifeâ€
i
repeated
roughly
stretching
out
my
hand
she
lifted
her
hand
left
the
knife
upon
the
table
and
at
the
same
time
springing
up
glided
softly
out
of
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
that
evening
i
spent
alone
in
the
smoking-room
and
for
the
first
time
she
did
not
come
to
bid
me
good-night
i
sat
smoking
my
cigar
in
a
tumult
of
furious
despair
and
love
the
situation
was
becoming
intolerable
it
could
not
be
en-dured
i
longed
for
a
crisis
even
for
a
violent
one
i
could
have
cried
aloud
that
night
for
a
veritable
tragedy
there
were
moments
when
i
would
almost
have
killed
the
child
who
mysteriously
eluded
and
defied
me
i
could
have
wreaked
a
cruel
vengeance
upon
the
body
for
the
sin
of
the
mind
i
was
terribly
mortally
distressed
after
a
long
and
painful
self-communion
i
resolved
to
make
another
wild
effort
to
set
things
right
before
it
was
too
late
and
when
the
clock
chimed
the
half-hour
after
ten
i
went
upstairs
softly
to
her
bedroom
and
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
meaning
to
enter
to
catch
margot
in
my
arms
tell
her
how
deep
my
love
for
her
was
how
she
injured
me
by
her
base
fears
and
how
she
was
driving
me
back
from
the
gentleness
she
had
given
me
to
the
cruelty
to
the
brutality
of
my
first
nature
the
door
resisted
me
it
was
locked
i
paused
a
moment
and
then
tapped
gently
i
heard
a
sudden
rustle
within
as
if
someone
hurried
across
the
floor
away
from
the
door
and
then
margotâ€™s
voice
cried
sharply
â€œwhoâ€™s
that
who
is
thereâ€
â€œmargot
it
is
i
i
wish
to
speak
to
you--to
say
good-nightâ€
â€œgood-nightâ€
she
said
â€œbut
let
me
in
for
a
momentâ€
there
was
a
silence--it
seemed
to
me
a
long
one
then
she
answered
â€œnot
now
dear
i--i
am
so
tiredâ€
â€œopen
the
door
for
a
momentâ€
â€œi
am
very
tired
good-nightâ€
the
cold
level
tone
of
her
voice--for
the
anxiety
had
left
it
after
that
first
sudden
cry--roused
me
to
a
sudden
fury
of
action
i
seized
the
handle
of
the
door
and
pressed
with
all
my
strength
physically
i
am
a
very
powerful
man--my
anger
and
despair
gave
me
a
giantâ€™s
might
i
burst
the
lock
and
sprang
into
the
room
my
impulse
was
to
seize
margot
in
my
arms
and
crush
her
to
death
it
might
be
in
an
embrace
she
could
not
struggle
against
the
blood
coursed
like
molten
fire
through
my
veins
the
lust
of
love
the
lust
of
murder
even
perhaps
was
upon
me
i
sprang
impetuously
into
the
room
no
candles
were
alight
in
it
the
blinds
were
up
and
the
chill
moonbeams
filtered
through
the
small
lattice
panes
by
the
farthest
window
in
the
yellowish
radiance
was
huddled
a
white
thing
a
sudden
cold
took
hold
upon
me
all
the
warmth
in
me
froze
up
i
stopped
where
i
was
and
held
my
breath
that
white
thing
seen
thus
uncertainly
had
no
semblance
to
humanity
it
was
animal
wholly
i
could
have
believed
for
the
moment
that
a
white
cat
crouched
from
me
there
by
the
curtain
waiting
to
spring
what
a
strange
illusion
that
was
i
tried
to
laugh
at
it
afterwards
but
at
the
moment
horror
stole
through
me--horror
and
almost
awe
all
desire
of
violence
left
me
heat
was
dead
i
felt
cold
as
stone
i
could
not
even
speak
a
word
suddenly
the
white
thing
moved
the
curtain
was
drawn
sharply
the
moonlight
was
blotted
out
the
room
was
plunged
in
darkness--a
darkness
in
which
that
thing
could
see
i
turned
and
stole
out
of
the
room
i
could
have
fled
driven
by
the
nameless
fear
that
was
upon
me
only
when
the
morning
dawned
did
the
man
in
me
awake
and
i
cursed
myself
for
my
cowardice

the
following
evening
we
were
asked
to
dine
out
with
some
neighbours
who
lived
a
few
miles
off
in
a
wonderful
old
norman
castle
near
the
sea
during
the
day
neither
of
us
had
made
the
slightest
allusion
to
the
incidents
of
the
previous
night
we
both
felt
it
a
relief
to
go
into
society
i
think
the
friends
to
whom
we
went--lord
and
lady
melchester--had
a
large
party
staying
with
them
and
we
were
i
believe
the
only
outsiders
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
one
of
their
guests
was
professor
black
whose
name
i
have
already
mentioned--a
little
dry
thin
acrid
man
with
thick
black
hair
innocent
of
the
comb
and
pursed
straight
lips
i
had
met
him
two
or
three
times
in
london
and
as
he
had
only
just
arrived
at
the
castle
and
scarcely
knew
his
fellow-visitors
there
he
brought
his
wine
over
to
me
when
the
ladies
left
the
dining-room
and
entered
into
conversation
at
the
moment
i
was
glad
but
before
we
followed
the
women
i
would
have
given
a
year--i
might
say
years--of
my
life
not
to
have
spoken
to
him
not
to
have
heard
him
speak
that
night
how
did
we
drift
into
that
fatal
conversation
i
hardly
remember
we
talked
first
of
the
neighbourhood
then
swayed
away
to
books
then
to
people
yes
that
was
how
it
came
about
the
professor
was
speaking
of
a
man
whom
we
both
knew
in
town
a
curiously
effeminate
man
whose
every
thought
and
feeling
seemed
that
of
a
woman
i
said
i
disliked
him
and
condemned
him
for
his
womanâ€™s
demeanour
his
womanâ€™s
mind
but
the
professor
thereupon
joined
issue
with
me
â€œpity
the
fellow
if
you
likeâ€
he
uttered
in
his
rather
strident
voice
â€œbut
as
to
condemning
him
i
would
as
soon
condemn
a
tadpole
for
not
being
a
full-grown
frog
his
soul
is
beyond
his
power
to
manage
or
even
to
coerce
you
may
depend
upon
itâ€
having
sipped
his
port
he
drew
a
little
nearer
to
me
and
slightly
dropped
his
voice
â€œthere
would
be
less
censure
of
individuals
in
this
worldâ€
he
said
â€œif
people
were
only
a
little
more
thoughtful
these
souls
are
like
letters
and
sometimes
they
are
sealed
up
in
the
wrong
envelope
for
instance
a
manâ€™s
soul
may
be
put
into
a
womanâ€™s
body
or
vice
versã¢
it
has
been
so
in
d------â€˜s
case
a
mistake
has
been
madeâ€
â€œby
providenceâ€
i
interrupted
with
perhaps
just
a
soupã§on
of
sarcasm
in
my
voice
the
professor
smiled
â€œsuppose
we
imitate
thomas
hardy
and
say
by
the
president
of
the
immortals
who
makes
sport
with
more
humans
than
tessâ€
he
answered
â€œmistakes
may
be
deliberate
just
as
their
reverse
may
be
accidental
even
a
mighty
power
may
condescend
sometimes
to
a
very
practical
joke
to
a
thinker
the
world
is
full
of
apple-pie
beds
and
cold
wet
sponges
fall
on
us
from
at
least
half
the
doors
we
push
open
the
soul-juggleries
of
the
before-mentioned
president
are
very
curious
but
people
will
not
realize
that
soul
transference
from
body
to
body
is
as
much
a
plain
fact
as
the
daily
rising
of
the
sun
on
one
half
of
the
world
and
its
nightly
setting
on
the
otherâ€
â€œdo
you
mean
that
souls
pass
on
into
the
world
again
on
the
death
of
the
particular
body
in
which
they
have
been
for
the
moment
confinedâ€
i
asked
â€œprecisely
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
sometimes
a
womanâ€™s
soul
goes
into
a
manâ€™s
body
then
the
man
acts
woman
and
people
cry
against
him
for
effeminacy
the
soul
colours
the
body
with
actions
the
body
does
not
colour
the
soul
or
not
in
the
same
degreeâ€
â€œbut
we
are
not
irresponsible
we
can
command
ourselvesâ€
the
professor
smiled
dryly
â€œyou
think
soâ€
he
said
â€œi
sometimes
doubt
itâ€
â€œand
i
doubt
your
theory
of
soul
transferenceâ€
â€œthat
shows
me--pardon
the
apparent
impertinence--that
you
have
never
really
examined
the
soul
question
with
any
close
attention
do
you
suppose
that
d------
really
likes
being
so
noticeably
different
from
other
men
depend
upon
itâ€™
he
has
noticed
in
himself
what
we
have
noticed
in
him
depend
upon
it
he
has
tried
to
be
ordinary
and
found
it
impossible
his
soul
manages
him
as
a
strong
nature
manages
a
weak
one
and
his
soul
is
a
female
not
a
male
for
souls
have
sexes
otherwise
what
would
be
the
sense
of
talking
about
wedded
souls
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
of
the
truth
of
reincarnation
on
earth
souls
go
on
and
on
following
out
their
object
of
developmentâ€
â€œyou
believe
that
every
soul
is
reincarnatedâ€
â€œa
certain
number
of
timesâ€
â€œthat
even
in
the
animal
world
the
soul
of
one
animal
passes
into
the
body
of
anotherâ€
â€œwait
a
minute
now
we
are
coming
to
something
that
tends
to
prove
my
theory
true
animals
have
souls
as
you
imply
who
can
know
them
intimately
and
doubt
it
for
an
instant
souls
as
immortal--or
as
mortal--as
ours
and
their
souls
too
pass
onâ€
â€œinto
other
animalsâ€
â€œpossibly
and
eventually
in
the
process
of
development
into
human
beingsâ€
i
laughed
perhaps
a
little
rudely
â€œmy
dear
professor
i
thought
that
old
notion
was
quite
exploded
in
these
modern
scientific
daysâ€
â€œi
found
my
beliefs
upon
my
own
minute
observationsâ€
he
said
rather
frigidly
â€œi
notice
certain
animals
masquerading--to
some
extent--as
human
beings
and
i
draw
my
own
conclusions
if
they
happen
to
fit
in
at
all
with
the
conclusions
of
pythagoras--or
anyone
else
for
that
matter--well
and
good
if
not
i
am
not
much
concerned
surely
you
notice
the
animal--and
not
merely
the
animal
but
definite
animals--reproduced
in
man
there
are
men
whose
whole
demeanour
suggests
the
monkey
i
have
met
women
who
in
manner
appearance
and
even
character
were
intensely
like
catsâ€
i
uttered
a
slight
exclamation
which
did
not
interrupt
him
â€œnow
i
have
made
a
minute
study
of
cats
of
all
animals
they
interest
me
the
most
they
have
less
apparent
intensity
less
uttered
passion
than
dogs
but
in
my
opinion
more
character
their
subtlety
is
extraordinary
their
sensitiveness
wonderful
will
you
understand
me
when
i
say
that
all
dogs
are
men
all
cats
women
that
remark
expresses
the
difference
between
themâ€
he
paused
a
moment
â€œgo
on--go
onâ€
i
said
leaning
forward
with
my
eyes
fixed
upon
his
keen
puckered
face
he
seemed
pleased
with
my
suddenly-aroused
interest
â€œcats
are
as
subtle
and
as
difficult
to
understand
as
the
most
complex
woman
and
almost
as
full
of
intuitions
if
they
have
been
well
treated
there
is
often
a
certain
gracious
condescending
suavity
in
their
demeanour
at
first
even
towards
a
total
stranger
but
if
that
stranger
is
ill
disposed
toward
them
they
seem
instinctively
to
read
his
soul
and
they
are
in
arms
directly
yet
they
dissemble
their
fears
in
a
cold
indifference
and
reserve
they
do
not
take
action
they
merely
abstain
from
action
they
withdraw
the
soul
that
has
peeped
out
as
they
can
withdraw
their
claws
into
the
pads
upon
their
feet
they
do
not
show
fight
as
a
dog
might
they
do
not
become
aggressive
nor
do
they
whine
and
put
their
tails
between
their
legs
they
are
simply
on
guard
watchful
mistrustful
is
not
all
this
womanâ€
â€œpossiblyâ€
i
answered
with
a
painful
effort
to
assume
indifference
â€œa
woman
intuitively
knows
who
is
her
friend
and
who
is
her
enemy--so
long
at
least
as
her
heart
is
not
engaged
then
she
runs
wild
i
allow
a
woman----
but
i
need
not
pursue
the
parallel
besides
perhaps
it
is
scarcely
to
the
point
for
my
object
is
not
to
bolster
up
an
absurd
contention
that
all
women
have
the
souls
of
cats
no
but
i
have
met
women
so
strangely
like
cats
that
their
souls
have
as
i
said
before
souls
do
coloured
their
bodies
in
actions
they
have
had
the
very
look
of
cats
in
their
faces
they
have
moved
like
them
their
demeanour
has
been
patently
and
strongly
feline
now
i
see
nothing
ridiculous
in
the
assumption
that
such
womenâ€™s
bodies
may
contain
souls--in
process
of
development
of
course--that
formerly
were
merely
cat
souls
but
that
are
now
gaining
humanity
gradually
are
working
their
way
upwards
in
the
scale
after
all
we
are
not
so
much
above
the
animals
and
in
our
lapses
we
often
become
merely
animals
the
soul
retrogrades
for
the
momentâ€
he
paused
again
and
looked
at
me
i
was
biting
my
lips
and
my
glass
of
wine
was
untouched
he
took
my
agitation
as
a
compliment
i
suppose
for
he
smiled
and
said
â€œare
you
in
process
of
conversionâ€
i
half
shook
my
head
then
i
said
with
an
effort
â€œit
is
a
curious
and
interesting
idea
of
course
but
there
is
much
to
explain
now
i
should
like
to
ask
you
this
do
you--do
you
believe
that
a
soul
if
it
passes
on
as
you
think
carries
its
memory
with
it
its
memory
of
former
loves
and--and
hates
say
that
a
catâ€™s
soul
goes
to
a
womanâ€™s
body
and
that
the
cat
has
been--has
been--well
tortured--possibly
killed
by
someone--say
some
man
long
ago
would
the
woman
meeting
that
man
remember
and
shrink
from
himâ€
â€œthat
is
a
very
interesting
and
curious
problem
and
one
which
i
do
not
pretend
to
have
solved
i
can
therefore
only
suggest
what
might
be
what
seems
to
me
reasonable
â€œi
do
not
believe
that
the
woman
would
remember
positively
but
i
think
she
might
have
an
intuition
about
the
man
our
intuitions
are
perhaps
sometimes
only
the
fragmentary
recollections
of
our
souls
of
what
formerly
happened
to
them
when
in
other
bodies
why
otherwise
should
we
sometimes
conceive
an
ardent
dislike
of
some
stranger--charming
to
all
appearance--of
whom
we
know
no
evil
whom
we
have
never
heard
of
nor
met
before
intuitions
so
called
are
often
only
tattered
memories
and
these
intuitions
might
i
should
fancy
be
strengthened
given
body
robustness
by
associations--of
place
for
example
cats
become
intensely
attached
to
localities
to
certain
spots
a
particular
house
or
garden
a
particular
fireside
apart
from
the
people
who
may
be
there
possibly
if
the
man
and
the
woman
of
whom
you
speak
could
be
brought
together
in
the
very
place
where
the
torture
arid
death
occurred
the
dislike
of
the
woman
might
deepen
into
positive
hatred
it
would
however
be
always
unreasoning
hatred
i
think
and
even
quite
unaccountable
to
herself
still----â€
but
here
lord
melchester
rose
from
the
table
the
conversations
broke
into
fragments
i
felt
that
i
was
pale
to
the
lips
we
passed
into
the
drawing-room
the
ladies
were
grouped
together
at
one
end
near
the
piano
margot
was
among
them
she
was
as
usual
dressed
in
white
and
round
the
bottom
of
her
gown
there
was
an
edging
of
snow-white
fur
as
we
came
in
she
moved
away
from
the
piano
to
a
sofa
at
some
distance
and
sank
down
upon
it
professor
black
who
had
entered
the
room
at
my
side
seized
my
arm
gently
â€œnow
that
ladyâ€
he
whispered
in
my
ear--â€œi
donâ€™t
know
who
she
may
be
but
she
is
intensely
cat-like
i
observed
it
before
dinner
did
you
notice
the
way
she
moved
just
then--the
soft
yielding
easy
manner
in
which
she
sat
down
falling
at
once
quite
naturally
into
a
charming
pose
and
her
china-blue
eyes
are----â€
â€œshe
is
my
wife
professorâ€
i
interrupted
harshly
he
looked
decidedly
taken
aback
â€œi
beg
your
pardon
i
had
no
idea
i
did
not
enter
the
drawing-room
to-night
till
after
you
arrived
i
believed
that
lady
was
one
of
my
fellow-guests
in
the
house
let
me
congratulate
you
she
is
very
beautifulâ€
and
then
he
mingled
rather
hastily
in
the
group
near
the
piano
the
man
is
mad
i
know--mad
as
a
hatter
on
one
point
like
so
many
clever
men
he
sees
the
animal
in
every
person
he
meets
just
because
his
preposterous
theory
inclines
him
to
do
so
having
given
in
his
adherence
to
it
he
sees
facts
not
as
they
are
but
as
he
wishes
them
to
be
but
he
shall
not
carry
me
with
him
the
theory
is
his
not
mine
it
does
not
hold
water
for
a
moment
i
can
laugh
at
it
now
but
that
night
i
confess
it
did
seize
me
for
the
time
being
i
could
scarcely
talk
i
found
myself
watching
margot
with
a
terrible
intentness
and
i
found
myself
agreeing
with
the
professor
to
an
extent
that
made
me
marvel
at
my
own
previous
blindness
there
was
something
strangely
feline
about
the
girl
i
had
married--the
soft
white
girl
who
was
becoming
terrible
to
me
dear
though
she
still
was
and
must
always
be
her
movements
had
the
subtle
instinctive
and
certain
grace
of
a
catâ€™s
her
cushioned
step
which
had
often
struck
me
before
was
like
the
step
of
a
cat
and
those
china-blue
eyes
a
sudden
cold
seemed
to
pass
over
me
as
i
understood
why
i
had
recognised
them
when
i
first
met
margot
they
were
the
eyes
of
the
animal
i
had
tortured
the
animal
i
had
killed
yes
but
that
proved
nothing
absolutely
nothing
many
people
had
the
eyes
of
animals--the
soft
eyes
of
dogs
the
furtive
cruel
eyes
of
tigers
i
had
known
such
people
i
had
even
once
had
an
affair
with
a
girl
who
was
always
called
the
shot
partridge
because
her
eyes
were
supposed
to
be
like
those
of
a
dying
bird
i
tried
to
laugh
to
myself
as
i
remembered
this
but
i
felt
cold
and
my
senses
seemed
benumbed
as
by
a
great
horror
i
sat
like
a
stone
with
my
eyes
fixed
upon
margot
trying
painfully
to
read
into
her
all
that
the
words
of
professor
black
had
suggested
to
me--trying
but
with
the
wish
not
to
succeed
i
was
roused
by
lady
melchester
who
came
toward
me
asking
me
to
do
something
i
forget
now
what
i
forced
myself
to
be
cheerful
to
join
in
the
conversation
to
seem
at
my
ease
but
i
felt
like
one
oppressed
with
nightmare
and
i
could
scarcely
withdraw
my
eyes
from
the
sofa
where
my
wife
was
sitting
she
was
talking
now
to
professor
black
who
had
just
been
introduced
to
her
and
i
felt
a
sudden
fury
in
my
heart
as
i
thought
that
he
was
perhaps
dryly
coldly
studying
her
little
knowing
what
issues--far-reaching
it
might
be
in
their
consequences--hung
upon
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
his
strange
theory
they
were
talking
earnestly
and
presently
it
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
be
imbuing
margot
with
his
pernicious
doctrines
that
he
might
be
giving
her
a
knowledge
of
her
own
soul
which
now
she
lacked
the
idea
was
insupportable
i
broke
off
abruptly
the
conversation
in
which
i
was
taking
part
and
hurried
over
to
them
with
an
impulse
which
must
have
astonished
anyone
who
took
note
of
me
i
sat
down
on
a
chair
drew
it
forward
almost
violently
and
thrust
myself
in
between
them
â€œwhat
are
you
two
talking
aboutâ€
i
said
roughly
with
a
suspicious
glance
at
margot
the
professor
looked
at
me
in
surprise
â€œi
was
instructing
your
wife
in
some
of
the
mysteries
of
salmon-fishingâ€
he
said
â€œshe
tells
me
you
have
a
salmon-river
running
through
your
groundsâ€
i
laughed
uneasily
â€œso
you
are
a
fisherman
as
well
as
a
romantic
theoristâ€
i
said
rather
rudely
â€œhow
i
wish
i
were
as
versatile
come
margot
we
must
be
going
now
the
carriage
ought
to
be
hereâ€
she
rose
quietly
and
bade
the
professor
good-night
but
as
she
glanced
up
at
me
in
rising
i
fancied
i
caught
a
new
expression
in
her
eyes
a
ray
of
determination
of
set
purpose
mingled
with
the
gloomy
fire
of
their
despair
as
soon
as
we
were
in
the
carriage
i
spoke
with
a
strained
effort
at
ease
and
the
haphazard
tone
which
should
mask
furtive
cross-examination
â€œprofessor
black
is
an
interesting
manâ€
i
said
â€œdo
you
think
soâ€
she
answered
from
her
dark
corner
â€œsurely
his
intellect
is
really
alive
yet
with
all
his
scientific
knowledge
and
his
power
of
eliciting
facts
and
elucidating
them
he
is
but
a
feather
headed
manâ€
i
paused
but
she
made
no
answer
â€œdo
you
not
think
soâ€
â€œhow
can
i
tellâ€
she
replied
â€œwe
only
talked
about
fishing
he
managed
to
make
that
topic
a
pleasant
oneâ€
her
tone
was
frank
i
felt
relieved
â€œhe
is
exceedingly
cleverâ€
i
said
heartily
and
we
relapsed
into
silence
when
we
reached
home
and
margot
had
removed
her
cloak
she
came
up
to
me
and
laid
her
hand
on
my
arm
so
unaccustomed
was
her
touch
now
that
i
was
startled
she
was
looking
at
me
with
a
curious
steady
smile--an
unwavering
smile
that
chilled
instead
of
warming
me
â€œronaldâ€
she
said
â€œthere
has
been
a
breach
between
us
i
have
been
the
cause
of
it
i
should
like
to--to
heal
it
do
you
still
love
me
as
you
didâ€
i
did
not
answer
immediately
i
could
not
her
voice
schooled
as
it
was
seemed
somehow
at
issue
with
the
words
she
uttered
there
was
a
desperate
hard
note
in
it
that
accorded
with
that
enigmatic
smile
of
the
mouth
it
roused
a
cold
suspicion
within
me
that
i
was
close
to
a
masked
battery
i
shrank
physically
from
the
touch
of
her
hand
she
waited
with
her
eyes
upon
me
our
faces
were
lit
tremblingly
by
the
flames
of
the
two
candles
we
held
at
last
i
found
a
voice
â€œcan
you
doubt
itâ€
i
asked
she
drew
a
step
nearer
â€œthen
let
us
resume
our
old
relationsâ€
she
said
â€œour
old
relationsâ€
â€œyesâ€
i
shuddered
as
if
a
phantom
stole
by
me
i
was
seized
with
horror
â€œto-night
it
is
not
possibleâ€
â€œwhyâ€
she
said
still
with
that
steady
smile
of
the
mouth
â€œbecause--because
i
donâ€™t
know--i----
to-morrow
it
shall
be
as
of
old
margot--to-morrow
i
promise
youâ€
â€œvery
well
kiss
me
dearâ€
i
forced
myself
to
touch
her
lips
with
mine
which
mouth
was
the
colder
then
with
that
soft
stealthy
step
of
hers
she
vanished
towards
her
room
i
heard
the
door
close
gently
i
listened
the
key
was
not
turned
in
the
lock
this
sudden
abandonment
by
margot
of
the
fantastic
precautions
i
had
almost
become
accustomed
to
filled
me
with
a
nameless
dread
that
night
i
fastened
my
door
for
the
first
time
iv
friday
night
november
6th
i
fastened
my
door
and
when
i
went
to
bed
lay
awake
for
hours
listening
a
horror
was
upon
me
then
which
has
not
left
me
since
for
a
moment
which
may
never
leave
me
i
shivered
with
cold
that
night
the
cold
born
of
sheer
physical
terror
i
knew
that
i
was
shut
up
in
the
house
with
a
soul
bent
on
unreasoning
vengeance
the
soul
of
the
animal
which
i
had
killed
prisoned
in
the
body
of
the
woman
i
had
married
i
was
sick
with
fear
then
i
am
sick
with
fear
now
to-night
i
am
so
tired
my
eyes
are
heavy
and
my
head
aches
no
wonder
i
have
not
slept
for
three
nights
i
have
not
dared
to
sleep
this
strange
revolution
in
my
wifeâ€™s
conduct
this
passionless
change--for
i
felt
instinctively
that
warm
humanity
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
transformation--took
place
three
nights
ago
these
three
last
days
mar-got
has
been
playing
a
part
with
what
object
when
i
sat
down
to
this
gray
record
of
two
souls--at
once
dreary
and
fantastic
as
it
would
seem
perhaps
to
many--i
desired
to
reassure
myself
to
write
myself
into
sweet
reason
into
peace
i
have
tried
to
accomplish
the
impossible
i
feel
that
the
wildest
theory
may
be
the
truest
after
all--that
on
the
borderland
of
what
seems
madness
actuality
paces
every
remembrance
of
my
mind
confirms
the
truth
first
suggested
to
me
by
professor
black
i
know
margotâ€™s
object
now
the
soul
of
the
creature
that
i
tortured
that
i
killed
has
passed
into
the
body
of
the
woman
whom
i
love
and
that
soul
which
once
slept
in
its
new
cage
is
awake
now
watching
plotting
perhaps
unconsciously
to
itself
it
recognises
me
it
stares
out
upon
me
with
eyes
in
which
the
dull
terror
deepens
to
hate
but
it
does
not
understand
why
it
fears--why
in
its
fear
it
hates
intuition
has
taken
the
place
of
memory
the
change
of
environment
has
killed
recollection
and
has
left
instinct
in
its
place
why
did
i
ever
sit
down
to
write
the
recalling
of
facts
has
set
the
seal
upon
my
despair
instinct
only
woke
in
margot
when
i
brought
her
to
the
place
the
soul
had
known
in
the
years
when
it
looked
out
upon
the
world
from
the
body
of
an
animal
that
first
day
on
the
terrace
instinct
stirred
in
its
sleep
opened
its
eyes
gazed
forth
upon
me
wonderingly
inquiringly
margotâ€™s
faint
remembrance
of
the
terrace
walk
of
the
flower-pots
of
the
grass
borders
where
the
cat
had
often
stretched
itself
in
the
sun
her
eagerness
to
see
the
chamber
of
death
her
stealthy
visits
to
that
chamber
her
growing
uneasiness
deepening
to
acute
apprehension
and
finally
to
a
deadly
malignity--all
lead
me
irresistibly
to
one
conclusion
the
animalâ€™s
soul
within
her
no
longer
merely
shrinks
away
in
fear
of
me
it
has
grown
sinister
it
lies
in
ambush
full
of
a
cold
a
stealthy
intention
that
curious
abrupt
change
in
margotâ€™s
demeanour
from
avoidance
to
invitation
marked
the
subtle
inward
development
of
feeling
the
silent
passage
from
sensation
only
towards
action
formerly
she
feared
me
now
i
must
fear
her
the
soul
crouching
in
its
cage
shows
its
teeth
it
is
compassing
my
destruction
the
womanâ€™s
body
twitches
with
desire
to
avenge
the
death
of
the
animalâ€™s
i
feel
that
it
is
only
waiting
the
moment
to
spring
and
the
inherent
love
of
life
breeds
in
me
a
physical
fear
of
it
as
of
a
subtle
enemy
for
even
if
the
soul
is
brave
the
body
dreads
to
die
and
seems
at
moments
to
possess
a
second
soul
purely
physical
that
cries
out
childishly
against
pain
against
death
then
too
there
is
a
cowardice
of
the
imagination
that
can
shake
the
strongest
heart
and
this
resurrection
from
the
dead
from
the
murdered
appals
my
imagination
that
what
i
thought
i
had
long
since
slain
should
have
companioned
me
so
closely
when
i
knew
it
not
i
am
sick
with
fear
physical
and
mental
two
days
ago
when
i
unlocked
my
bedroom
door
in
the
morning
and
saw
the
autumn
sunlight
streaming
in
through
the
leaded
panes
of
the
hall
windows
and
heard
the
river
dancing
merrily
down
the
gully
among
the
trees
that
will
soon
be
quite
bare
and
naked
i
said
to
myself
â€œyou
have
been
mad
your
mind
has
been
filled
with
horrible
dreams
that
have
transformed
you
into
a
coward
and
your
wife
into
a
demon
put
them
away
from
youâ€
i
looked
across
the
gully
a
clear
cold-thin
light
shone
upon
the
distant
mountains
the
cloud
stacks
lay
piled
above
the
scawfell
range
the
sky
was
a
sheet
of
faded
turquoise
i
opened
the
window
for
a
moment
the
air
was
dry
and
keen
how
sweet
it
was
to
feel
it
on
my
face
i
went
down
to
the
breakfast-room
mar-got
was
moving
about
it
softly
awaiting
me
in
her
white
hands
were
letters
they
dropped
upon
the
table
as
she
stole
up
to
greet
me
her
lips
were
set
tightly
together
but
she
lifted
them
to
kiss
me
how
close
i
came
to
my
enemy
as
our
mouths
touched
her
lips
were
colder
than
the
wind
now
that
i
was
with
her
my
momentary
sensation
of
acute
relief
deserted
me
the
horror
that
oppressed
me
returned
i
could
not
eat--i
could
only
make
a
pretence
of
doing
so
and
my
hand
trembled
so
excessively
that
i
could
scarcely
raise
my
cup
from
the
table
she
noticed
this
and
gently
asked
me
if
i
was
ill
i
shook
my
head
when
breakfast
was
over
she
said
in
a
low
level
voice
â€œronald
have
you
thought
over
what
i
said
last
nightâ€
â€œlast
nightâ€
i
answered
with
an
effort
â€œyes
about
the
coldness
between
us
i
think
i
have
been
unwell
unhappy
out
of
sorts
you
know
that--that
women
are
more
subject
to
moods
than
men
moods
they
cannot
always
account
for
even
to
themselves
i
have
hurt
you
lately
i
know
i
am
sorry
i
want
you
to
forgive
me
to--toâ€--she
paused
a
moment
and
i
heard
her
draw
in
her
breath
sharply--â€œto
take
me
back
into
your
heart
againâ€
every
word
as
she
said
it
sounded
to
me
like
a
sinister
threat
and
the
last
sentence
made
my
blood
literally
go
cold
in
my
veins
i
met
her
eyes
she
did
not
withdraw
hers
they
looked
into
mine
they
were
the
blue
eyes
of
the
cat
which
i
had
held
upon
my
knees
years
ago
i
had
gazed
into
them
as
a
boy
and
watched
the
horror
and
the
fear
dawn
in
them
with
a
malignant
triumph
â€œi
have
nothing
to
forgiveâ€
i
said
in
a
broken
husky
voice
â€œyou
have
muchâ€
she
answered
firmly
â€œbut
do
not--pray
do
not
bear
maliceâ€
â€œthere
is
no
malice
in
my
heart--nowâ€
i
said
and
the
words
seemed
like
a
cowardly
plea
for
mercy
to
the
victim
of
the
past
she
lifted
one
of
her
soft
white
hands
to
my
breast
â€œthen
it
shall
all
be
as
it
was
before
and
to-night
you
will
come
back
to
meâ€
i
hesitated
looking
down
but
how
could
i
refuse
what
excuse
could
i
make
for
denying
the
request
then
i
repeated
mechanically
â€œto-night
i
will
come
back
to
youâ€
a
terrible
slight
smile
travelled
over
her
face
she
turned
and
left
me
i
sat
down
immediately
i
felt
too
unnerved
to
remain
standing
i
was
giving
way
utterly
to
an
imaginative
horror
that
seemed
to
threaten
my
reason
in
vain
i
tried
to
pull
myself
together
my
body
was
in
a
cold
sweat
all
mastery
of
my
nerves
seemed
gone
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
remained
there
but
i
was
aroused
by
the
entrance
of
the
butler
he
glanced
towards
me
in
some
obvious
surprise
and
this
astonishment
of
a
servant
acted
upon
me
almost
like
a
scourge
i
sprang
up
hastily
â€œtell
the
groom
to
saddle
the
mareâ€
i
said
â€œi
am
going
for
a
ride
immediatelyâ€
air
action
were
what
i
needed
to
drive
this
stupor
away
i
must
get
away
from
this
house
of
tears
i
must
be
alone
i
must
wrestle
with
myself
regain
my
courage
kill
the
coward
in
me
i
threw
myself
upon
the
mare
and
rode
out
at
a
gallop
towards
the
moors
of
eskdale
along
the
lonely
country
roads
all
day
i
rode
and
all
day
i
thought
of
that
dark
house
of
that
white
creature
awaiting
my
return
peering
from
the
windows
perhaps
listening
for
my
horseâ€™s
hoofs
on
the
gravel
keeping
still
the
long
vigil
of
vengeance
my
imagination
sickened
fainted
as
my
wearied
horse
stumbled
along
the
shadowy
roads
my
terror
was
too
great
now
to
be
physical
it
was
a
terror
purely
of
the
spirit
and
indescribable
to
sleep
with
that
white
thing
that
waited
me
to
lie
in
the
dark
by
it
to
know
that
it
was
there
close
to
me
if
it
killed
me
what
matter
it
was
to
live
and
to
be
near
it
with
it
that
appalled
me
the
lights
of
the
house
gleamed
out
through
the
trees
i
heard
the
sound
of
the
river
i
got
off
my
horse
and
walked
furtively
into
the
hall
looking
round
me
margot
glided
up
to
me
immediately
and
took
my
whip
and
hat
from
me
with
her
soft
velvety
white
hands
i
shivered
at
her
touch
at
dinner
her
blue
eyes
watched
me
i
could
not
eat
but
i
drank
more
wine
than
usual
when
i
turned
to
go
down
to
the
smoking-room
she
said
â€œdonâ€™t
be
very
long
ronaldâ€
i
muttered
i
scarcely
know
what
words
in
reply
it
was
close
on
midnight
before
i
went
to
bed
when
i
entered
her
room
shielding
the
light
of
the
candle
with
my
hand
she
was
still
awake
nestling
against
the
pillows
she
stretched
herself
curiously
and
smiled
up
at
me
â€œi
thought
you
were
never
coming
dearâ€
she
said
i
knew
that
i
was
very
pale
but
she
did
not
remark
it
i
got
into
bed
but
left
the
candle
still
burning
presently
she
said
â€œwhy
donâ€™t
you
put
the
candle
outâ€
i
looked
at
her
furtively
her
face
seemed
to
me
carved
in
stone
it
was
so
rigid
so
expressionless
she
lay
away
from
me
at
the
extreme
edge
of
the
bed
sideways
with
her
hands
toward
me
â€œwhy
donâ€™t
youâ€
she
repeated
with
her
blue
eyes
on
me
â€œi
donâ€™t
feel
sleepyâ€
i
answered
slowly
â€œyou
never
will
while
there
is
a
light
in
the
roomâ€
she
said
â€œyou
wish
me
to
put
it
outâ€
â€œyes
how
odd
you
are
to-night
ronald
is
anything
the
matterâ€
â€œnoâ€
i
answered
and
i
blew
the
light
out
how
ghastly
the
darkness
was
i
believed
she
meant
to
smother
me
in
my
sleep
i
knew
it
i
determined
to
keep
awake
it
was
horrible
to
think
that
as
we
lay
there
she
could
see
me
all
the
time
as
if
it
were
daylight
the
night
wore
on
she
was
quite
silent
and
motionless
i
lay
listening
it
must
have
been
towards
morning
when
i
closed
my
eyes
not
because
i
was
sleepy
but
because
i
was
so
tired
of
gazing
at
blackness
soon
after
i
had
done
this
there
was
a
stealthy
movement
in
the
bed
â€œmargot
are
you
awakeâ€
i
instantly
cried
out
sharply
the
movement
immediately
ceased
there
was
no
reply
when
the
light
of
dawn
stole
in
at
the
window
she
seemed
to
be
sleeping

last
night
i
did
not
close
my
eyes
once
she
did
not
move
she
means
to
tire
me
out
and
she
has
the
strength
to
do
it
to-night
i
feel
so
intensely
heavy
soon
i
must
sleep
and
then----
shall
i
seek
any
longer
to
defend
myself
everything
seems
so
inevitable
so
beyond
my
power
like
the
working
of
an
inexorable
justice
bent
on
visiting
the
sin
of
the
father
upon
the
child
for
was
not
the
cruel
boy
the
father
of
the
man
and
yet
is
this
tragedy
inevitable
it
cannot
be
i
will
be
a
man
i
will
rise
up
and
combat
it
i
will
take
margot
away
from
this
house
that
her
soul
remembers
in
which
its
body
so
long
ago
was
tortured
and
slain
and
she
will--she
must
forget
instinct
will
sleep
once
more
it
shall
be
so
i
will
have
it
so
i
will
strew
poppies
over
her
soul
i
will
take
her
far
away
from
here
far
away
to
places
where
she
will
be
once
more
as
she
has
been
to-morrow
we
will
go
to-morrow----

ah
that
cry
was
it
my
own
i
am
suffocating
what
was
that
the
horror
of
it
the
pen
has
fallen
from
my
hand
i
must
have
slept
and
i
have
dreamed
in
my
dream
she
stole
upon
me
that
white
thing
her
velvety
hands
were
on
my
throat
the
soul
stared
out
from
her
eyes
the
soul
of
the
cat
even
her
body
her
womanâ€™s
body
seemed
to
change
at
the
moment
of
vengeance
she
slowly
strangled
me
and
as
the
breath
died
from
me
and
my
failing
eyes
gazed
at
her
she
was
no
longer
woman
at
all
but
something
lithe
and
white
and
soft
fur
enveloped
my
throat
those
hands
were
claws
that
breath
on
my
face
was
the
breath
of
an
animal
the
body
had
come
back
to
companion
the
soul
in
its
vengeance
the
body
of----
ah
it
was
too
horrible
can
vengeance
for
the
dead
bring
with
it
resurrection
of
the
dead
hark
there
is
a
voice
calling
to
me
from
upstairs
â€œronald
are
you
never
coming
i
am
tired
of
waiting
for
you
ronaldâ€
â€œyesâ€
â€œcome
to
meâ€
â€œand
i
must
goâ€

just
at
the
glimmer
of
dawn
the
first
pale
shaft
of
the
sun
struck
across
a
bed
upon
which
lay
the
huddled
and
distorted
corpse
of
a
man
his
head
was
sunk
down
in
the
pillows
his
eyes
that
could
not
see
stared
towards
the
rising
light
and
from
the
open
window
of
the
chamber
of
death
a
woman
in
a
white
wrapper
leaned
out
watching
eagerly
with
wide
blue
eyes
the
birds
as
they
darted
to
and
fro
rested
on
the
climbing
creepers
or
circled
above
the
gorge
through
which
the
river
ran
her
set
lips
smiled
she
looked
like
one
calm
easy
and
at
peace
presently
an
unwary
sparrow
perched
on
the
trellis
beneath
the
window
just
within
her
reach
her
white
hand
darted
down
softly
closed
on
the
bird
she
vanished
from
the
window
can
the
dead
hear
did
he
catch
the
sound
of
her
faint
continuous
purring
as
she
crouched
with
her
prey
upon
the
floor
