the
experiment
i
am
glad
you
came
clarke
very
glad
indeed
i
was
not
sure
you
could
spare
the
time
i
was
able
to
make
arrangements
for
a
few
days
things
are
not
very
lively
just
now
but
have
you
no
misgivings
raymond
is
it
absolutely
safe
the
two
men
were
slowly
pacing
the
terrace
in
front
of
dr
raymond's
house
the
sun
still
hung
above
the
western
mountain-line
but
it
shone
with
a
dull
red
glow
that
cast
no
shadows
and
all
the
air
was
quiet
a
sweet
breath
came
from
the
great
wood
on
the
hillside
above
and
with
it
at
intervals
the
soft
murmuring
call
of
the
wild
doves
below
in
the
long
lovely
valley
the
river
wound
in
and
out
between
the
lonely
hills
and
as
the
sun
hovered
and
vanished
into
the
west
a
faint
mist
pure
white
began
to
rise
from
the
hills
dr
raymond
turned
sharply
to
his
friend
safe
of
course
it
is
in
itself
the
operation
is
a
perfectly
simple
one
any
surgeon
could
do
it
and
there
is
no
danger
at
any
other
stage
none
absolutely
no
physical
danger
whatsoever
i
give
you
my
word
you
are
always
timid
clarke
always
but
you
know
my
history
i
have
devoted
myself
to
transcendental
medicine
for
the
last
twenty
years
i
have
heard
myself
called
quack
and
charlatan
and
impostor
but
all
the
while
i
knew
i
was
on
the
right
path
five
years
ago
i
reached
the
goal
and
since
then
every
day
has
been
a
preparation
for
what
we
shall
do
tonight
i
should
like
to
believe
it
is
all
true
clarke
knit
his
brows
and
looked
doubtfully
at
dr
raymond
are
you
perfectly
sure
raymond
that
your
theory
is
not
a
phantasmagoria--a
splendid
vision
certainly
but
a
mere
vision
after
all
dr
raymond
stopped
in
his
walk
and
turned
sharply
he
was
a
middle-aged
man
gaunt
and
thin
of
a
pale
yellow
complexion
but
as
he
answered
clarke
and
faced
him
there
was
a
flush
on
his
cheek
look
about
you
clarke
you
see
the
mountain
and
hill
following
after
hill
as
wave
on
wave
you
see
the
woods
and
orchard
the
fields
of
ripe
corn
and
the
meadows
reaching
to
the
reed-beds
by
the
river
you
see
me
standing
here
beside
you
and
hear
my
voice
but
i
tell
you
that
all
these
things--yes
from
that
star
that
has
just
shone
out
in
the
sky
to
the
solid
ground
beneath
our
feet--i
say
that
all
these
are
but
dreams
and
shadows
the
shadows
that
hide
the
real
world
from
our
eyes
there
is
a
real
world
but
it
is
beyond
this
glamour
and
this
vision
beyond
these
'chases
in
arras
dreams
in
a
career'
beyond
them
all
as
beyond
a
veil
i
do
not
know
whether
any
human
being
has
ever
lifted
that
veil
but
i
do
know
clarke
that
you
and
i
shall
see
it
lifted
this
very
night
from
before
another's
eyes
you
may
think
this
all
strange
nonsense
it
may
be
strange
but
it
is
true
and
the
ancients
knew
what
lifting
the
veil
means
they
called
it
seeing
the
god
pan
clarke
shivered
the
white
mist
gathering
over
the
river
was
chilly
it
is
wonderful
indeed
he
said
we
are
standing
on
the
brink
of
a
strange
world
raymond
if
what
you
say
is
true
i
suppose
the
knife
is
absolutely
necessary
yes
a
slight
lesion
in
the
grey
matter
that
is
all
a
trifling
rearrangement
of
certain
cells
a
microscopical
alteration
that
would
escape
the
attention
of
ninety-nine
brain
specialists
out
of
a
hundred
i
don't
want
to
bother
you
with
'shop'
clarke
i
might
give
you
a
mass
of
technical
detail
which
would
sound
very
imposing
and
would
leave
you
as
enlightened
as
you
are
now
but
i
suppose
you
have
read
casually
in
out-of-the-way
corners
of
your
paper
that
immense
strides
have
been
made
recently
in
the
physiology
of
the
brain
i
saw
a
paragraph
the
other
day
about
digby's
theory
and
browne
faber's
discoveries
theories
and
discoveries
where
they
are
standing
now
i
stood
fifteen
years
ago
and
i
need
not
tell
you
that
i
have
not
been
standing
still
for
the
last
fifteen
years
it
will
be
enough
if
i
say
that
five
years
ago
i
made
the
discovery
that
i
alluded
to
when
i
said
that
ten
years
ago
i
reached
the
goal
after
years
of
labour
after
years
of
toiling
and
groping
in
the
dark
after
days
and
nights
of
disappointments
and
sometimes
of
despair
in
which
i
used
now
and
then
to
tremble
and
grow
cold
with
the
thought
that
perhaps
there
were
others
seeking
for
what
i
sought
at
last
after
so
long
a
pang
of
sudden
joy
thrilled
my
soul
and
i
knew
the
long
journey
was
at
an
end
by
what
seemed
then
and
still
seems
a
chance
the
suggestion
of
a
moment's
idle
thought
followed
up
upon
familiar
lines
and
paths
that
i
had
tracked
a
hundred
times
already
the
great
truth
burst
upon
me
and
i
saw
mapped
out
in
lines
of
sight
a
whole
world
a
sphere
unknown
continents
and
islands
and
great
oceans
in
which
no
ship
has
sailed
to
my
belief
since
a
man
first
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
beheld
the
sun
and
the
stars
of
heaven
and
the
quiet
earth
beneath
you
will
think
this
all
high-flown
language
clarke
but
it
is
hard
to
be
literal
and
yet
i
do
not
know
whether
what
i
am
hinting
at
cannot
be
set
forth
in
plain
and
lonely
terms
for
instance
this
world
of
ours
is
pretty
well
girded
now
with
the
telegraph
wires
and
cables
thought
with
something
less
than
the
speed
of
thought
flashes
from
sunrise
to
sunset
from
north
to
south
across
the
floods
and
the
desert
places
suppose
that
an
electrician
of
today
were
suddenly
to
perceive
that
he
and
his
friends
have
merely
been
playing
with
pebbles
and
mistaking
them
for
the
foundations
of
the
world
suppose
that
such
a
man
saw
uttermost
space
lie
open
before
the
current
and
words
of
men
flash
forth
to
the
sun
and
beyond
the
sun
into
the
systems
beyond
and
the
voice
of
articulate-speaking
men
echo
in
the
waste
void
that
bounds
our
thought
as
analogies
go
that
is
a
pretty
good
analogy
of
what
i
have
done
you
can
understand
now
a
little
of
what
i
felt
as
i
stood
here
one
evening
it
was
a
summer
evening
and
the
valley
looked
much
as
it
does
now
i
stood
here
and
saw
before
me
the
unutterable
the
unthinkable
gulf
that
yawns
profound
between
two
worlds
the
world
of
matter
and
the
world
of
spirit
i
saw
the
great
empty
deep
stretch
dim
before
me
and
in
that
instant
a
bridge
of
light
leapt
from
the
earth
to
the
unknown
shore
and
the
abyss
was
spanned
you
may
look
in
browne
faber's
book
if
you
like
and
you
will
find
that
to
the
present
day
men
of
science
are
unable
to
account
for
the
presence
or
to
specify
the
functions
of
a
certain
group
of
nerve-cells
in
the
brain
that
group
is
as
it
were
land
to
let
a
mere
waste
place
for
fanciful
theories
i
am
not
in
the
position
of
browne
faber
and
the
specialists
i
am
perfectly
instructed
as
to
the
possible
functions
of
those
nerve-centers
in
the
scheme
of
things
with
a
touch
i
can
bring
them
into
play
with
a
touch
i
say
i
can
set
free
the
current
with
a
touch
i
can
complete
the
communication
between
this
world
of
sense
and--we
shall
be
able
to
finish
the
sentence
later
on
yes
the
knife
is
necessary
but
think
what
that
knife
will
effect
it
will
level
utterly
the
solid
wall
of
sense
and
probably
for
the
first
time
since
man
was
made
a
spirit
will
gaze
on
a
spirit-world
clarke
mary
will
see
the
god
pan
but
you
remember
what
you
wrote
to
me
i
thought
it
would
be
requisite
that
she--
he
whispered
the
rest
into
the
doctor's
ear
not
at
all
not
at
all
that
is
nonsense
i
assure
you
indeed
it
is
better
as
it
is
i
am
quite
certain
of
that
consider
the
matter
well
raymond
it's
a
great
responsibility
something
might
go
wrong
you
would
be
a
miserable
man
for
the
rest
of
your
days
no
i
think
not
even
if
the
worst
happened
as
you
know
i
rescued
mary
from
the
gutter
and
from
almost
certain
starvation
when
she
was
a
child
i
think
her
life
is
mine
to
use
as
i
see
fit
come
it's
getting
late
we
had
better
go
in
dr
raymond
led
the
way
into
the
house
through
the
hall
and
down
a
long
dark
passage
he
took
a
key
from
his
pocket
and
opened
a
heavy
door
and
motioned
clarke
into
his
laboratory
it
had
once
been
a
billiard-room
and
was
lighted
by
a
glass
dome
in
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
whence
there
still
shone
a
sad
grey
light
on
the
figure
of
the
doctor
as
he
lit
a
lamp
with
a
heavy
shade
and
placed
it
on
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
clarke
looked
about
him
scarcely
a
foot
of
wall
remained
bare
there
were
shelves
all
around
laden
with
bottles
and
phials
of
all
shapes
and
colours
and
at
one
end
stood
a
little
chippendale
book-case
raymond
pointed
to
this
you
see
that
parchment
oswald
crollius
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
show
me
the
way
though
i
don't
think
he
ever
found
it
himself
that
is
a
strange
saying
of
his
'in
every
grain
of
wheat
there
lies
hidden
the
soul
of
a
star'
there
was
not
much
furniture
in
the
laboratory
the
table
in
the
centre
a
stone
slab
with
a
drain
in
one
corner
the
two
armchairs
on
which
raymond
and
clarke
were
sitting
that
was
all
except
an
odd-looking
chair
at
the
furthest
end
of
the
room
clarke
looked
at
it
and
raised
his
eyebrows
yes
that
is
the
chair
said
raymond
we
may
as
well
place
it
in
position
he
got
up
and
wheeled
the
chair
to
the
light
and
began
raising
and
lowering
it
letting
down
the
seat
setting
the
back
at
various
angles
and
adjusting
the
foot-rest
it
looked
comfortable
enough
and
clarke
passed
his
hand
over
the
soft
green
velvet
as
the
doctor
manipulated
the
levers
now
clarke
make
yourself
quite
comfortable
i
have
a
couple
hours'
work
before
me
i
was
obliged
to
leave
certain
matters
to
the
last
raymond
went
to
the
stone
slab
and
clarke
watched
him
drearily
as
he
bent
over
a
row
of
phials
and
lit
the
flame
under
the
crucible
the
doctor
had
a
small
hand-lamp
shaded
as
the
larger
one
on
a
ledge
above
his
apparatus
and
clarke
who
sat
in
the
shadows
looked
down
at
the
great
shadowy
room
wondering
at
the
bizarre
effects
of
brilliant
light
and
undefined
darkness
contrasting
with
one
another
soon
he
became
conscious
of
an
odd
odour
at
first
the
merest
suggestion
of
odour
in
the
room
and
as
it
grew
more
decided
he
felt
surprised
that
he
was
not
reminded
of
the
chemist's
shop
or
the
surgery
clarke
found
himself
idly
endeavouring
to
analyse
the
sensation
and
half
conscious
he
began
to
think
of
a
day
fifteen
years
ago
that
he
had
spent
roaming
through
the
woods
and
meadows
near
his
own
home
it
was
a
burning
day
at
the
beginning
of
august
the
heat
had
dimmed
the
outlines
of
all
things
and
all
distances
with
a
faint
mist
and
people
who
observed
the
thermometer
spoke
of
an
abnormal
register
of
a
temperature
that
was
almost
tropical
strangely
that
wonderful
hot
day
of
the
fifties
rose
up
again
in
clarke's
imagination
the
sense
of
dazzling
all-pervading
sunlight
seemed
to
blot
out
the
shadows
and
the
lights
of
the
laboratory
and
he
felt
again
the
heated
air
beating
in
gusts
about
his
face
saw
the
shimmer
rising
from
the
turf
and
heard
the
myriad
murmur
of
the
summer
i
hope
the
smell
doesn't
annoy
you
clarke
there's
nothing
unwholesome
about
it
it
may
make
you
a
bit
sleepy
that's
all
clarke
heard
the
words
quite
distinctly
and
knew
that
raymond
was
speaking
to
him
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
rouse
himself
from
his
lethargy
he
could
only
think
of
the
lonely
walk
he
had
taken
fifteen
years
ago
it
was
his
last
look
at
the
fields
and
woods
he
had
known
since
he
was
a
child
and
now
it
all
stood
out
in
brilliant
light
as
a
picture
before
him
above
all
there
came
to
his
nostrils
the
scent
of
summer
the
smell
of
flowers
mingled
and
the
odour
of
the
woods
of
cool
shaded
places
deep
in
the
green
depths
drawn
forth
by
the
sun's
heat
and
the
scent
of
the
good
earth
lying
as
it
were
with
arms
stretched
forth
and
smiling
lips
overpowered
all
his
fancies
made
him
wander
as
he
had
wandered
long
ago
from
the
fields
into
the
wood
tracking
a
little
path
between
the
shining
undergrowth
of
beech-trees
and
the
trickle
of
water
dropping
from
the
limestone
rock
sounded
as
a
clear
melody
in
the
dream
thoughts
began
to
go
astray
and
to
mingle
with
other
thoughts
the
beech
alley
was
transformed
to
a
path
between
ilex-trees
and
here
and
there
a
vine
climbed
from
bough
to
bough
and
sent
up
waving
tendrils
and
drooped
with
purple
grapes
and
the
sparse
grey-green
leaves
of
a
wild
olive-tree
stood
out
against
the
dark
shadows
of
the
ilex
clarke
in
the
deep
folds
of
dream
was
conscious
that
the
path
from
his
father's
house
had
led
him
into
an
undiscovered
country
and
he
was
wondering
at
the
strangeness
of
it
all
when
suddenly
in
place
of
the
hum
and
murmur
of
the
summer
an
infinite
silence
seemed
to
fall
on
all
things
and
the
wood
was
hushed
and
for
a
moment
in
time
he
stood
face
to
face
there
with
a
presence
that
was
neither
man
nor
beast
neither
the
living
nor
the
dead
but
all
things
mingled
the
form
of
all
things
but
devoid
of
all
form
and
in
that
moment
the
sacrament
of
body
and
soul
was
dissolved
and
a
voice
seemed
to
cry
let
us
go
hence
and
then
the
darkness
of
darkness
beyond
the
stars
the
darkness
of
everlasting
when
clarke
woke
up
with
a
start
he
saw
raymond
pouring
a
few
drops
of
some
oily
fluid
into
a
green
phial
which
he
stoppered
tightly
you
have
been
dozing
he
said
the
journey
must
have
tired
you
out
it
is
done
now
i
am
going
to
fetch
mary
i
shall
be
back
in
ten
minutes
clarke
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
wondered
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
but
passed
from
one
dream
into
another
he
half
expected
to
see
the
walls
of
the
laboratory
melt
and
disappear
and
to
awake
in
london
shuddering
at
his
own
sleeping
fancies
but
at
last
the
door
opened
and
the
doctor
returned
and
behind
him
came
a
girl
of
about
seventeen
dressed
all
in
white
she
was
so
beautiful
that
clarke
did
not
wonder
at
what
the
doctor
had
written
to
him
she
was
blushing
now
over
face
and
neck
and
arms
but
raymond
seemed
unmoved
mary
he
said
the
time
has
come
you
are
quite
free
are
you
willing
to
trust
yourself
to
me
entirely
yes
dear
do
you
hear
that
clarke
you
are
my
witness
here
is
the
chair
mary
it
is
quite
easy
just
sit
in
it
and
lean
back
are
you
ready
yes
dear
quite
ready
give
me
a
kiss
before
you
begin
the
doctor
stooped
and
kissed
her
mouth
kindly
enough
now
shut
your
eyes
he
said
the
girl
closed
her
eyelids
as
if
she
were
tired
and
longed
for
sleep
and
raymond
placed
the
green
phial
to
her
nostrils
her
face
grew
white
whiter
than
her
dress
she
struggled
faintly
and
then
with
the
feeling
of
submission
strong
within
her
crossed
her
arms
upon
her
breast
as
a
little
child
about
to
say
her
prayers
the
bright
light
of
the
lamp
fell
full
upon
her
and
clarke
watched
changes
fleeting
over
her
face
as
the
changes
of
the
hills
when
the
summer
clouds
float
across
the
sun
and
then
she
lay
all
white
and
still
and
the
doctor
turned
up
one
of
her
eyelids
she
was
quite
unconscious
raymond
pressed
hard
on
one
of
the
levers
and
the
chair
instantly
sank
back
clarke
saw
him
cutting
away
a
circle
like
a
tonsure
from
her
hair
and
the
lamp
was
moved
nearer
raymond
took
a
small
glittering
instrument
from
a
little
case
and
clarke
turned
away
shudderingly
when
he
looked
again
the
doctor
was
binding
up
the
wound
he
had
made
she
will
awake
in
five
minutes
raymond
was
still
perfectly
cool
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
we
can
only
wait
the
minutes
passed
slowly
they
could
hear
a
slow
heavy
ticking
there
was
an
old
clock
in
the
passage
clarke
felt
sick
and
faint
his
knees
shook
beneath
him
he
could
hardly
stand
suddenly
as
they
watched
they
heard
a
long-drawn
sigh
and
suddenly
did
the
colour
that
had
vanished
return
to
the
girl's
cheeks
and
suddenly
her
eyes
opened
clarke
quailed
before
them
they
shone
with
an
awful
light
looking
far
away
and
a
great
wonder
fell
upon
her
face
and
her
hands
stretched
out
as
if
to
touch
what
was
invisible
but
in
an
instant
the
wonder
faded
and
gave
place
to
the
most
awful
terror
the
muscles
of
her
face
were
hideously
convulsed
she
shook
from
head
to
foot
the
soul
seemed
struggling
and
shuddering
within
the
house
of
flesh
it
was
a
horrible
sight
and
clarke
rushed
forward
as
she
fell
shrieking
to
the
floor
three
days
later
raymond
took
clarke
to
mary's
bedside
she
was
lying
wide-awake
rolling
her
head
from
side
to
side
and
grinning
vacantly
yes
said
the
doctor
still
quite
cool
it
is
a
great
pity
she
is
a
hopeless
idiot
however
it
could
not
be
helped
and
after
all
she
has
seen
the
great
god
pan
ii
mr
clarke's
memoirs
mr
clarke
the
gentleman
chosen
by
dr
raymond
to
witness
the
strange
experiment
of
the
god
pan
was
a
person
in
whose
character
caution
and
curiosity
were
oddly
mingled
in
his
sober
moments
he
thought
of
the
unusual
and
eccentric
with
undisguised
aversion
and
yet
deep
in
his
heart
there
was
a
wide-eyed
inquisitiveness
with
respect
to
all
the
more
recondite
and
esoteric
elements
in
the
nature
of
men
the
latter
tendency
had
prevailed
when
he
accepted
raymond's
invitation
for
though
his
considered
judgment
had
always
repudiated
the
doctor's
theories
as
the
wildest
nonsense
yet
he
secretly
hugged
a
belief
in
fantasy
and
would
have
rejoiced
to
see
that
belief
confirmed
the
horrors
that
he
witnessed
in
the
dreary
laboratory
were
to
a
certain
extent
salutary
he
was
conscious
of
being
involved
in
an
affair
not
altogether
reputable
and
for
many
years
afterwards
he
clung
bravely
to
the
commonplace
and
rejected
all
occasions
of
occult
investigation
indeed
on
some
homeopathic
principle
he
for
some
time
attended
the
seances
of
distinguished
mediums
hoping
that
the
clumsy
tricks
of
these
gentlemen
would
make
him
altogether
disgusted
with
mysticism
of
every
kind
but
the
remedy
though
caustic
was
not
efficacious
clarke
knew
that
he
still
pined
for
the
unseen
and
little
by
little
the
old
passion
began
to
reassert
itself
as
the
face
of
mary
shuddering
and
convulsed
with
an
unknown
terror
faded
slowly
from
his
memory
occupied
all
day
in
pursuits
both
serious
and
lucrative
the
temptation
to
relax
in
the
evening
was
too
great
especially
in
the
winter
months
when
the
fire
cast
a
warm
glow
over
his
snug
bachelor
apartment
and
a
bottle
of
some
choice
claret
stood
ready
by
his
elbow
his
dinner
digested
he
would
make
a
brief
pretence
of
reading
the
evening
paper
but
the
mere
catalogue
of
news
soon
palled
upon
him
and
clarke
would
find
himself
casting
glances
of
warm
desire
in
the
direction
of
an
old
japanese
bureau
which
stood
at
a
pleasant
distance
from
the
hearth
like
a
boy
before
a
jam-closet
for
a
few
minutes
he
would
hover
indecisive
but
lust
always
prevailed
and
clarke
ended
by
drawing
up
his
chair
lighting
a
candle
and
sitting
down
before
the
bureau
its
pigeon-holes
and
drawers
teemed
with
documents
on
the
most
morbid
subjects
and
in
the
well
reposed
a
large
manuscript
volume
in
which
he
had
painfully
entered
the
gems
of
his
collection
clarke
had
a
fine
contempt
for
published
literature
the
most
ghostly
story
ceased
to
interest
him
if
it
happened
to
be
printed
his
sole
pleasure
was
in
the
reading
compiling
and
rearranging
what
he
called
his
memoirs
to
prove
the
existence
of
the
devil
and
engaged
in
this
pursuit
the
evening
seemed
to
fly
and
the
night
appeared
too
short
on
one
particular
evening
an
ugly
december
night
black
with
fog
and
raw
with
frost
clarke
hurried
over
his
dinner
and
scarcely
deigned
to
observe
his
customary
ritual
of
taking
up
the
paper
and
laying
it
down
again
he
paced
two
or
three
times
up
and
down
the
room
and
opened
the
bureau
stood
still
a
moment
and
sat
down
he
leant
back
absorbed
in
one
of
those
dreams
to
which
he
was
subject
and
at
length
drew
out
his
book
and
opened
it
at
the
last
entry
there
were
three
or
four
pages
densely
covered
with
clarke's
round
set
penmanship
and
at
the
beginning
he
had
written
in
a
somewhat
larger
hand
singular
narrative
told
me
by
my
friend
dr
phillips
he
assures
me
that
all
the
facts
related
therein
are
strictly
and
wholly
true
but
refuses
to
give
either
the
surnames
of
the
persons
concerned
or
the
place
where
these
extraordinary
events
occurred
mr
clarke
began
to
read
over
the
account
for
the
tenth
time
glancing
now
and
then
at
the
pencil
notes
he
had
made
when
it
was
told
him
by
his
friend
it
was
one
of
his
humours
to
pride
himself
on
a
certain
literary
ability
he
thought
well
of
his
style
and
took
pains
in
arranging
the
circumstances
in
dramatic
order
he
read
the
following
story--
the
persons
concerned
in
this
statement
are
helen
v
who
if
she
is
still
alive
must
now
be
a
woman
of
twenty-three
rachel
m
since
deceased
who
was
a
year
younger
than
the
above
and
trevor
w
an
imbecile
aged
eighteen
these
persons
were
at
the
period
of
the
story
inhabitants
of
a
village
on
the
borders
of
wales
a
place
of
some
importance
in
the
time
of
the
roman
occupation
but
now
a
scattered
hamlet
of
not
more
than
five
hundred
souls
it
is
situated
on
rising
ground
about
six
miles
from
the
sea
and
is
sheltered
by
a
large
and
picturesque
forest
some
eleven
years
ago
helen
v
came
to
the
village
under
rather
peculiar
circumstances
it
is
understood
that
she
being
an
orphan
was
adopted
in
her
infancy
by
a
distant
relative
who
brought
her
up
in
his
own
house
until
she
was
twelve
years
old
thinking
however
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
child
to
have
playmates
of
her
own
age
he
advertised
in
several
local
papers
for
a
good
home
in
a
comfortable
farmhouse
for
a
girl
of
twelve
and
this
advertisement
was
answered
by
mr
r
a
well-to-do
farmer
in
the
above-mentioned
village
his
references
proving
satisfactory
the
gentleman
sent
his
adopted
daughter
to
mr
r
with
a
letter
in
which
he
stipulated
that
the
girl
should
have
a
room
to
herself
and
stated
that
her
guardians
need
be
at
no
trouble
in
the
matter
of
education
as
she
was
already
sufficiently
educated
for
the
position
in
life
which
she
would
occupy
in
fact
mr
r
was
given
to
understand
that
the
girl
be
allowed
to
find
her
own
occupations
and
to
spend
her
time
almost
as
she
liked
mr
r
duly
met
her
at
the
nearest
station
a
town
seven
miles
away
from
his
house
and
seems
to
have
remarked
nothing
extraordinary
about
the
child
except
that
she
was
reticent
as
to
her
former
life
and
her
adopted
father
she
was
however
of
a
very
different
type
from
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
her
skin
was
a
pale
clear
olive
and
her
features
were
strongly
marked
and
of
a
somewhat
foreign
character
she
appears
to
have
settled
down
easily
enough
into
farmhouse
life
and
became
a
favourite
with
the
children
who
sometimes
went
with
her
on
her
rambles
in
the
forest
for
this
was
her
amusement
mr
r
states
that
he
has
known
her
to
go
out
by
herself
directly
after
their
early
breakfast
and
not
return
till
after
dusk
and
that
feeling
uneasy
at
a
young
girl
being
out
alone
for
so
many
hours
he
communicated
with
her
adopted
father
who
replied
in
a
brief
note
that
helen
must
do
as
she
chose
in
the
winter
when
the
forest
paths
are
impassable
she
spent
most
of
her
time
in
her
bedroom
where
she
slept
alone
according
to
the
instructions
of
her
relative
it
was
on
one
of
these
expeditions
to
the
forest
that
the
first
of
the
singular
incidents
with
which
this
girl
is
connected
occurred
the
date
being
about
a
year
after
her
arrival
at
the
village
the
preceding
winter
had
been
remarkably
severe
the
snow
drifting
to
a
great
depth
and
the
frost
continuing
for
an
unexampled
period
and
the
summer
following
was
as
noteworthy
for
its
extreme
heat
on
one
of
the
very
hottest
days
in
this
summer
helen
v
left
the
farmhouse
for
one
of
her
long
rambles
in
the
forest
taking
with
her
as
usual
some
bread
and
meat
for
lunch
she
was
seen
by
some
men
in
the
fields
making
for
the
old
roman
road
a
green
causeway
which
traverses
the
highest
part
of
the
wood
and
they
were
astonished
to
observe
that
the
girl
had
taken
off
her
hat
though
the
heat
of
the
sun
was
already
tropical
as
it
happened
a
labourer
joseph
w
by
name
was
working
in
the
forest
near
the
roman
road
and
at
twelve
o'clock
his
little
son
trevor
brought
the
man
his
dinner
of
bread
and
cheese
after
the
meal
the
boy
who
was
about
seven
years
old
at
the
time
left
his
father
at
work
and
as
he
said
went
to
look
for
flowers
in
the
wood
and
the
man
who
could
hear
him
shouting
with
delight
at
his
discoveries
felt
no
uneasiness
suddenly
however
he
was
horrified
at
hearing
the
most
dreadful
screams
evidently
the
result
of
great
terror
proceeding
from
the
direction
in
which
his
son
had
gone
and
he
hastily
threw
down
his
tools
and
ran
to
see
what
had
happened
tracing
his
path
by
the
sound
he
met
the
little
boy
who
was
running
headlong
and
was
evidently
terribly
frightened
and
on
questioning
him
the
man
elicited
that
after
picking
a
posy
of
flowers
he
felt
tired
and
lay
down
on
the
grass
and
fell
asleep
he
was
suddenly
awakened
as
he
stated
by
a
peculiar
noise
a
sort
of
singing
he
called
it
and
on
peeping
through
the
branches
he
saw
helen
v
playing
on
the
grass
with
a
strange
naked
man
who
he
seemed
unable
to
describe
more
fully
he
said
he
felt
dreadfully
frightened
and
ran
away
crying
for
his
father
joseph
w
proceeded
in
the
direction
indicated
by
his
son
and
found
helen
v
sitting
on
the
grass
in
the
middle
of
a
glade
or
open
space
left
by
charcoal
burners
he
angrily
charged
her
with
frightening
his
little
boy
but
she
entirely
denied
the
accusation
and
laughed
at
the
child's
story
of
a
strange
man
to
which
he
himself
did
not
attach
much
credence
joseph
w
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
boy
had
woke
up
with
a
sudden
fright
as
children
sometimes
do
but
trevor
persisted
in
his
story
and
continued
in
such
evident
distress
that
at
last
his
father
took
him
home
hoping
that
his
mother
would
be
able
to
soothe
him
for
many
weeks
however
the
boy
gave
his
parents
much
anxiety
he
became
nervous
and
strange
in
his
manner
refusing
to
leave
the
cottage
by
himself
and
constantly
alarming
the
household
by
waking
in
the
night
with
cries
of
the
man
in
the
wood
father
father
in
course
of
time
however
the
impression
seemed
to
have
worn
off
and
about
three
months
later
he
accompanied
his
father
to
the
home
of
a
gentleman
in
the
neighborhood
for
whom
joseph
w
occasionally
did
work
the
man
was
shown
into
the
study
and
the
little
boy
was
left
sitting
in
the
hall
and
a
few
minutes
later
while
the
gentleman
was
giving
w
his
instructions
they
were
both
horrified
by
a
piercing
shriek
and
the
sound
of
a
fall
and
rushing
out
they
found
the
child
lying
senseless
on
the
floor
his
face
contorted
with
terror
the
doctor
was
immediately
summoned
and
after
some
examination
he
pronounced
the
child
to
be
suffering
form
a
kind
of
fit
apparently
produced
by
a
sudden
shock
the
boy
was
taken
to
one
of
the
bedrooms
and
after
some
time
recovered
consciousness
but
only
to
pass
into
a
condition
described
by
the
medical
man
as
one
of
violent
hysteria
the
doctor
exhibited
a
strong
sedative
and
in
the
course
of
two
hours
pronounced
him
fit
to
walk
home
but
in
passing
through
the
hall
the
paroxysms
of
fright
returned
and
with
additional
violence
the
father
perceived
that
the
child
was
pointing
at
some
object
and
heard
the
old
cry
the
man
in
the
wood
and
looking
in
the
direction
indicated
saw
a
stone
head
of
grotesque
appearance
which
had
been
built
into
the
wall
above
one
of
the
doors
it
seems
the
owner
of
the
house
had
recently
made
alterations
in
his
premises
and
on
digging
the
foundations
for
some
offices
the
men
had
found
a
curious
head
evidently
of
the
roman
period
which
had
been
placed
in
the
manner
described
the
head
is
pronounced
by
the
most
experienced
archaeologists
of
the
district
to
be
that
of
a
faun
or
satyr
dr
phillips
tells
me
that
he
has
seen
the
head
in
question
and
assures
me
that
he
has
never
received
such
a
vivid
presentment
of
intense
evil
from
whatever
cause
arising
this
second
shock
seemed
too
severe
for
the
boy
trevor
and
at
the
present
date
he
suffers
from
a
weakness
of
intellect
which
gives
but
little
promise
of
amending
the
matter
caused
a
good
deal
of
sensation
at
the
time
and
the
girl
helen
was
closely
questioned
by
mr
r
but
to
no
purpose
she
steadfastly
denying
that
she
had
frightened
or
in
any
way
molested
trevor
the
second
event
with
which
this
girl's
name
is
connected
took
place
about
six
years
ago
and
is
of
a
still
more
extraordinary
character
at
the
beginning
of
the
summer
of
1882
helen
contracted
a
friendship
of
a
peculiarly
intimate
character
with
rachel
m
the
daughter
of
a
prosperous
farmer
in
the
neighbourhood
this
girl
who
was
a
year
younger
than
helen
was
considered
by
most
people
to
be
the
prettier
of
the
two
though
helen's
features
had
to
a
great
extent
softened
as
she
became
older
the
two
girls
who
were
together
on
every
available
opportunity
presented
a
singular
contrast
the
one
with
her
clear
olive
skin
and
almost
italian
appearance
and
the
other
of
the
proverbial
red
and
white
of
our
rural
districts
it
must
be
stated
that
the
payments
made
to
mr
r
for
the
maintenance
of
helen
were
known
in
the
village
for
their
excessive
liberality
and
the
impression
was
general
that
she
would
one
day
inherit
a
large
sum
of
money
from
her
relative
the
parents
of
rachel
were
therefore
not
averse
from
their
daughter's
friendship
with
the
girl
and
even
encouraged
the
intimacy
though
they
now
bitterly
regret
having
done
so
helen
still
retained
her
extraordinary
fondness
for
the
forest
and
on
several
occasions
rachel
accompanied
her
the
two
friends
setting
out
early
in
the
morning
and
remaining
in
the
wood
until
dusk
once
or
twice
after
these
excursions
mrs
m
thought
her
daughter's
manner
rather
peculiar
she
seemed
languid
and
dreamy
and
as
it
has
been
expressed
different
from
herself
but
these
peculiarities
seem
to
have
been
thought
too
trifling
for
remark
one
evening
however
after
rachel
had
come
home
her
mother
heard
a
noise
which
sounded
like
suppressed
weeping
in
the
girl's
room
and
on
going
in
found
her
lying
half
undressed
upon
the
bed
evidently
in
the
greatest
distress
as
soon
as
she
saw
her
mother
she
exclaimed
ah
mother
mother
why
did
you
let
me
go
to
the
forest
with
helen
mrs
m
was
astonished
at
so
strange
a
question
and
proceeded
to
make
inquiries
rachel
told
her
a
wild
story
she
said--
clarke
closed
the
book
with
a
snap
and
turned
his
chair
towards
the
fire
when
his
friend
sat
one
evening
in
that
very
chair
and
told
his
story
clarke
had
interrupted
him
at
a
point
a
little
subsequent
to
this
had
cut
short
his
words
in
a
paroxysm
of
horror
my
god
he
had
exclaimed
think
think
what
you
are
saying
it
is
too
incredible
too
monstrous
such
things
can
never
be
in
this
quiet
world
where
men
and
women
live
and
die
and
struggle
and
conquer
or
maybe
fail
and
fall
down
under
sorrow
and
grieve
and
suffer
strange
fortunes
for
many
a
year
but
not
this
phillips
not
such
things
as
this
there
must
be
some
explanation
some
way
out
of
the
terror
why
man
if
such
a
case
were
possible
our
earth
would
be
a
nightmare
but
phillips
had
told
his
story
to
the
end
concluding
her
flight
remains
a
mystery
to
this
day
she
vanished
in
broad
sunlight
they
saw
her
walking
in
a
meadow
and
a
few
moments
later
she
was
not
there
clarke
tried
to
conceive
the
thing
again
as
he
sat
by
the
fire
and
again
his
mind
shuddered
and
shrank
back
appalled
before
the
sight
of
such
awful
unspeakable
elements
enthroned
as
it
were
and
triumphant
in
human
flesh
before
him
stretched
the
long
dim
vista
of
the
green
causeway
in
the
forest
as
his
friend
had
described
it
he
saw
the
swaying
leaves
and
the
quivering
shadows
on
the
grass
he
saw
the
sunlight
and
the
flowers
and
far
away
far
in
the
long
distance
the
two
figures
moved
toward
him
one
was
rachel
but
the
other
clarke
had
tried
his
best
to
disbelieve
it
all
but
at
the
end
of
the
account
as
he
had
written
it
in
his
book
he
had
placed
the
inscription
et
diabolus
incarnate
est
et
homo
factus
est
iii
the
city
of
resurrections
herbert
good
god
is
it
possible
yes
my
name's
herbert
i
think
i
know
your
face
too
but
i
don't
remember
your
name
my
memory
is
very
queer
don't
you
recollect
villiers
of
wadham
so
it
is
so
it
is
i
beg
your
pardon
villiers
i
didn't
think
i
was
begging
of
an
old
college
friend
good-night
my
dear
fellow
this
haste
is
unnecessary
my
rooms
are
close
by
but
we
won't
go
there
just
yet
suppose
we
walk
up
shaftesbury
avenue
a
little
way
but
how
in
heaven's
name
have
you
come
to
this
pass
herbert
it's
a
long
story
villiers
and
a
strange
one
too
but
you
can
hear
it
if
you
like
come
on
then
take
my
arm
you
don't
seem
very
strong
the
ill-assorted
pair
moved
slowly
up
rupert
street
the
one
in
dirty
evil-looking
rags
and
the
other
attired
in
the
regulation
uniform
of
a
man
about
town
trim
glossy
and
eminently
well-to-do
villiers
had
emerged
from
his
restaurant
after
an
excellent
dinner
of
many
courses
assisted
by
an
ingratiating
little
flask
of
chianti
and
in
that
frame
of
mind
which
was
with
him
almost
chronic
had
delayed
a
moment
by
the
door
peering
round
in
the
dimly-lighted
street
in
search
of
those
mysterious
incidents
and
persons
with
which
the
streets
of
london
teem
in
every
quarter
and
every
hour
villiers
prided
himself
as
a
practised
explorer
of
such
obscure
mazes
and
byways
of
london
life
and
in
this
unprofitable
pursuit
he
displayed
an
assiduity
which
was
worthy
of
more
serious
employment
thus
he
stood
by
the
lamp-post
surveying
the
passers-by
with
undisguised
curiosity
and
with
that
gravity
known
only
to
the
systematic
diner
had
just
enunciated
in
his
mind
the
formula
london
has
been
called
the
city
of
encounters
it
is
more
than
that
it
is
the
city
of
resurrections
when
these
reflections
were
suddenly
interrupted
by
a
piteous
whine
at
his
elbow
and
a
deplorable
appeal
for
alms
he
looked
around
in
some
irritation
and
with
a
sudden
shock
found
himself
confronted
with
the
embodied
proof
of
his
somewhat
stilted
fancies
there
close
beside
him
his
face
altered
and
disfigured
by
poverty
and
disgrace
his
body
barely
covered
by
greasy
ill-fitting
rags
stood
his
old
friend
charles
herbert
who
had
matriculated
on
the
same
day
as
himself
with
whom
he
had
been
merry
and
wise
for
twelve
revolving
terms
different
occupations
and
varying
interests
had
interrupted
the
friendship
and
it
was
six
years
since
villiers
had
seen
herbert
and
now
he
looked
upon
this
wreck
of
a
man
with
grief
and
dismay
mingled
with
a
certain
inquisitiveness
as
to
what
dreary
chain
of
circumstances
had
dragged
him
down
to
such
a
doleful
pass
villiers
felt
together
with
compassion
all
the
relish
of
the
amateur
in
mysteries
and
congratulated
himself
on
his
leisurely
speculations
outside
the
restaurant
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
some
time
and
more
than
one
passer-by
stared
in
astonishment
at
the
unaccustomed
spectacle
of
a
well-dressed
man
with
an
unmistakable
beggar
hanging
on
to
his
arm
and
observing
this
villiers
led
the
way
to
an
obscure
street
in
soho
here
he
repeated
his
question
how
on
earth
has
it
happened
herbert
i
always
understood
you
would
succeed
to
an
excellent
position
in
dorsetshire
did
your
father
disinherit
you
surely
not
no
villiers
i
came
into
all
the
property
at
my
poor
father's
death
he
died
a
year
after
i
left
oxford
he
was
a
very
good
father
to
me
and
i
mourned
his
death
sincerely
enough
but
you
know
what
young
men
are
a
few
months
later
i
came
up
to
town
and
went
a
good
deal
into
society
of
course
i
had
excellent
introductions
and
i
managed
to
enjoy
myself
very
much
in
a
harmless
sort
of
way
i
played
a
little
certainly
but
never
for
heavy
stakes
and
the
few
bets
i
made
on
races
brought
me
in
money--only
a
few
pounds
you
know
but
enough
to
pay
for
cigars
and
such
petty
pleasures
it
was
in
my
second
season
that
the
tide
turned
of
course
you
have
heard
of
my
marriage
no
i
never
heard
anything
about
it
yes
i
married
villiers
i
met
a
girl
a
girl
of
the
most
wonderful
and
most
strange
beauty
at
the
house
of
some
people
whom
i
knew
i
cannot
tell
you
her
age
i
never
knew
it
but
so
far
as
i
can
guess
i
should
think
she
must
have
been
about
nineteen
when
i
made
her
acquaintance
my
friends
had
come
to
know
her
at
florence
she
told
them
she
was
an
orphan
the
child
of
an
english
father
and
an
italian
mother
and
she
charmed
them
as
she
charmed
me
the
first
time
i
saw
her
was
at
an
evening
party
i
was
standing
by
the
door
talking
to
a
friend
when
suddenly
above
the
hum
and
babble
of
conversation
i
heard
a
voice
which
seemed
to
thrill
to
my
heart
she
was
singing
an
italian
song
i
was
introduced
to
her
that
evening
and
in
three
months
i
married
helen
villiers
that
woman
if
i
can
call
her
woman
corrupted
my
soul
the
night
of
the
wedding
i
found
myself
sitting
in
her
bedroom
in
the
hotel
listening
to
her
talk
she
was
sitting
up
in
bed
and
i
listened
to
her
as
she
spoke
in
her
beautiful
voice
spoke
of
things
which
even
now
i
would
not
dare
whisper
in
the
blackest
night
though
i
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
wilderness
you
villiers
you
may
think
you
know
life
and
london
and
what
goes
on
day
and
night
in
this
dreadful
city
for
all
i
can
say
you
may
have
heard
the
talk
of
the
vilest
but
i
tell
you
you
can
have
no
conception
of
what
i
know
not
in
your
most
fantastic
hideous
dreams
can
you
have
imaged
forth
the
faintest
shadow
of
what
i
have
heard--and
seen
yes
seen
i
have
seen
the
incredible
such
horrors
that
even
i
myself
sometimes
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
ask
whether
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
behold
such
things
and
live
in
a
year
villiers
i
was
a
ruined
man
in
body
and
soul--in
body
and
soul
but
your
property
herbert
you
had
land
in
dorset
i
sold
it
all
the
fields
and
woods
the
dear
old
house--everything
and
the
money
she
took
it
all
from
me
and
then
left
you
yes
she
disappeared
one
night
i
don't
know
where
she
went
but
i
am
sure
if
i
saw
her
again
it
would
kill
me
the
rest
of
my
story
is
of
no
interest
sordid
misery
that
is
all
you
may
think
villiers
that
i
have
exaggerated
and
talked
for
effect
but
i
have
not
told
you
half
i
could
tell
you
certain
things
which
would
convince
you
but
you
would
never
know
a
happy
day
again
you
would
pass
the
rest
of
your
life
as
i
pass
mine
a
haunted
man
a
man
who
has
seen
hell
villiers
took
the
unfortunate
man
to
his
rooms
and
gave
him
a
meal
herbert
could
eat
little
and
scarcely
touched
the
glass
of
wine
set
before
him
he
sat
moody
and
silent
by
the
fire
and
seemed
relieved
when
villiers
sent
him
away
with
a
small
present
of
money
by
the
way
herbert
said
villiers
as
they
parted
at
the
door
what
was
your
wife's
name
you
said
helen
i
think
helen
what
the
name
she
passed
under
when
i
met
her
was
helen
vaughan
but
what
her
real
name
was
i
can't
say
i
don't
think
she
had
a
name
no
no
not
in
that
sense
only
human
beings
have
names
villiers
i
can't
say
anymore
good-bye
yes
i
will
not
fail
to
call
if
i
see
any
way
in
which
you
can
help
me
good-night
the
man
went
out
into
the
bitter
night
and
villiers
returned
to
his
fireside
there
was
something
about
herbert
which
shocked
him
inexpressibly
not
his
poor
rags
nor
the
marks
which
poverty
had
set
upon
his
face
but
rather
an
indefinite
terror
which
hung
about
him
like
a
mist
he
had
acknowledged
that
he
himself
was
not
devoid
of
blame
the
woman
he
had
avowed
had
corrupted
him
body
and
soul
and
villiers
felt
that
this
man
once
his
friend
had
been
an
actor
in
scenes
evil
beyond
the
power
of
words
his
story
needed
no
confirmation
he
himself
was
the
embodied
proof
of
it
villiers
mused
curiously
over
the
story
he
had
heard
and
wondered
whether
he
had
heard
both
the
first
and
the
last
of
it
no
he
thought
certainly
not
the
last
probably
only
the
beginning
a
case
like
this
is
like
a
nest
of
chinese
boxes
you
open
one
after
the
other
and
find
a
quainter
workmanship
in
every
box
most
likely
poor
herbert
is
merely
one
of
the
outside
boxes
there
are
stranger
ones
to
follow
villiers
could
not
take
his
mind
away
from
herbert
and
his
story
which
seemed
to
grow
wilder
as
the
night
wore
on
the
fire
seemed
to
burn
low
and
the
chilly
air
of
the
morning
crept
into
the
room
villiers
got
up
with
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
and
shivering
slightly
went
to
bed
a
few
days
later
he
saw
at
his
club
a
gentleman
of
his
acquaintance
named
austin
who
was
famous
for
his
intimate
knowledge
of
london
life
both
in
its
tenebrous
and
luminous
phases
villiers
still
full
of
his
encounter
in
soho
and
its
consequences
thought
austin
might
possibly
be
able
to
shed
some
light
on
herbert's
history
and
so
after
some
casual
talk
he
suddenly
put
the
question
do
you
happen
to
know
anything
of
a
man
named
herbert--charles
herbert
austin
turned
round
sharply
and
stared
at
villiers
with
some
astonishment
charles
herbert
weren't
you
in
town
three
years
ago
no
then
you
have
not
heard
of
the
paul
street
case
it
caused
a
good
deal
of
sensation
at
the
time
what
was
the
case
well
a
gentleman
a
man
of
very
good
position
was
found
dead
stark
dead
in
the
area
of
a
certain
house
in
paul
street
off
tottenham
court
road
of
course
the
police
did
not
make
the
discovery
if
you
happen
to
be
sitting
up
all
night
and
have
a
light
in
your
window
the
constable
will
ring
the
bell
but
if
you
happen
to
be
lying
dead
in
somebody's
area
you
will
be
left
alone
in
this
instance
as
in
many
others
the
alarm
was
raised
by
some
kind
of
vagabond
i
don't
mean
a
common
tramp
or
a
public-house
loafer
but
a
gentleman
whose
business
or
pleasure
or
both
made
him
a
spectator
of
the
london
streets
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
this
individual
was
as
he
said
'going
home'
it
did
not
appear
whence
or
whither
and
had
occasion
to
pass
through
paul
street
between
four
and
five
am
something
or
other
caught
his
eye
at
number
20
he
said
absurdly
enough
that
the
house
had
the
most
unpleasant
physiognomy
he
had
ever
observed
but
at
any
rate
he
glanced
down
the
area
and
was
a
good
deal
astonished
to
see
a
man
lying
on
the
stones
his
limbs
all
huddled
together
and
his
face
turned
up
our
gentleman
thought
his
face
looked
peculiarly
ghastly
and
so
set
off
at
a
run
in
search
of
the
nearest
policeman
the
constable
was
at
first
inclined
to
treat
the
matter
lightly
suspecting
common
drunkenness
however
he
came
and
after
looking
at
the
man's
face
changed
his
tone
quickly
enough
the
early
bird
who
had
picked
up
this
fine
worm
was
sent
off
for
a
doctor
and
the
policeman
rang
and
knocked
at
the
door
till
a
slatternly
servant
girl
came
down
looking
more
than
half
asleep
the
constable
pointed
out
the
contents
of
the
area
to
the
maid
who
screamed
loudly
enough
to
wake
up
the
street
but
she
knew
nothing
of
the
man
had
never
seen
him
at
the
house
and
so
forth
meanwhile
the
original
discoverer
had
come
back
with
a
medical
man
and
the
next
thing
was
to
get
into
the
area
the
gate
was
open
so
the
whole
quartet
stumped
down
the
steps
the
doctor
hardly
needed
a
moment's
examination
he
said
the
poor
fellow
had
been
dead
for
several
hours
and
it
was
then
the
case
began
to
get
interesting
the
dead
man
had
not
been
robbed
and
in
one
of
his
pockets
were
papers
identifying
him
as--well
as
a
man
of
good
family
and
means
a
favourite
in
society
and
nobody's
enemy
as
far
as
could
be
known
i
don't
give
his
name
villiers
because
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
story
and
because
it's
no
good
raking
up
these
affairs
about
the
dead
when
there
are
no
relations
living
the
next
curious
point
was
that
the
medical
men
couldn't
agree
as
to
how
he
met
his
death
there
were
some
slight
bruises
on
his
shoulders
but
they
were
so
slight
that
it
looked
as
if
he
had
been
pushed
roughly
out
of
the
kitchen
door
and
not
thrown
over
the
railings
from
the
street
or
even
dragged
down
the
steps
but
there
were
positively
no
other
marks
of
violence
about
him
certainly
none
that
would
account
for
his
death
and
when
they
came
to
the
autopsy
there
wasn't
a
trace
of
poison
of
any
kind
of
course
the
police
wanted
to
know
all
about
the
people
at
number
20
and
here
again
so
i
have
heard
from
private
sources
one
or
two
other
very
curious
points
came
out
it
appears
that
the
occupants
of
the
house
were
a
mr
and
mrs
charles
herbert
he
was
said
to
be
a
landed
proprietor
though
it
struck
most
people
that
paul
street
was
not
exactly
the
place
to
look
for
country
gentry
as
for
mrs
herbert
nobody
seemed
to
know
who
or
what
she
was
and
between
ourselves
i
fancy
the
divers
after
her
history
found
themselves
in
rather
strange
waters
of
course
they
both
denied
knowing
anything
about
the
deceased
and
in
default
of
any
evidence
against
them
they
were
discharged
but
some
very
odd
things
came
out
about
them
though
it
was
between
five
and
six
in
the
morning
when
the
dead
man
was
removed
a
large
crowd
had
collected
and
several
of
the
neighbours
ran
to
see
what
was
going
on
they
were
pretty
free
with
their
comments
by
all
accounts
and
from
these
it
appeared
that
number
20
was
in
very
bad
odour
in
paul
street
the
detectives
tried
to
trace
down
these
rumours
to
some
solid
foundation
of
fact
but
could
not
get
hold
of
anything
people
shook
their
heads
and
raised
their
eyebrows
and
thought
the
herberts
rather
'queer'
'would
rather
not
be
seen
going
into
their
house'
and
so
on
but
there
was
nothing
tangible
the
authorities
were
morally
certain
the
man
met
his
death
in
some
way
or
another
in
the
house
and
was
thrown
out
by
the
kitchen
door
but
they
couldn't
prove
it
and
the
absence
of
any
indications
of
violence
or
poisoning
left
them
helpless
an
odd
case
wasn't
it
but
curiously
enough
there's
something
more
that
i
haven't
told
you
i
happened
to
know
one
of
the
doctors
who
was
consulted
as
to
the
cause
of
death
and
some
time
after
the
inquest
i
met
him
and
asked
him
about
it
'do
you
really
mean
to
tell
me'
i
said
'that
you
were
baffled
by
the
case
that
you
actually
don't
know
what
the
man
died
of'
'pardon
me'
he
replied
'i
know
perfectly
well
what
caused
death
blank
died
of
fright
of
sheer
awful
terror
i
never
saw
features
so
hideously
contorted
in
the
entire
course
of
my
practice
and
i
have
seen
the
faces
of
a
whole
host
of
dead'
the
doctor
was
usually
a
cool
customer
enough
and
a
certain
vehemence
in
his
manner
struck
me
but
i
couldn't
get
anything
more
out
of
him
i
suppose
the
treasury
didn't
see
their
way
to
prosecuting
the
herberts
for
frightening
a
man
to
death
at
any
rate
nothing
was
done
and
the
case
dropped
out
of
men's
minds
do
you
happen
to
know
anything
of
herbert
well
replied
villiers
he
was
an
old
college
friend
of
mine
you
don't
say
so
have
you
ever
seen
his
wife
no
i
haven't
i
have
lost
sight
of
herbert
for
many
years
it's
queer
isn't
it
parting
with
a
man
at
the
college
gate
or
at
paddington
seeing
nothing
of
him
for
years
and
then
finding
him
pop
up
his
head
in
such
an
odd
place
but
i
should
like
to
have
seen
mrs
herbert
people
said
extraordinary
things
about
her
what
sort
of
things
well
i
hardly
know
how
to
tell
you
everyone
who
saw
her
at
the
police
court
said
she
was
at
once
the
most
beautiful
woman
and
the
most
repulsive
they
had
ever
set
eyes
on
i
have
spoken
to
a
man
who
saw
her
and
i
assure
you
he
positively
shuddered
as
he
tried
to
describe
the
woman
but
he
couldn't
tell
why
she
seems
to
have
been
a
sort
of
enigma
and
i
expect
if
that
one
dead
man
could
have
told
tales
he
would
have
told
some
uncommonly
queer
ones
and
there
you
are
again
in
another
puzzle
what
could
a
respectable
country
gentleman
like
mr
blank
we'll
call
him
that
if
you
don't
mind
want
in
such
a
very
queer
house
as
number
20
it's
altogether
a
very
odd
case
isn't
it
it
is
indeed
austin
an
extraordinary
case
i
didn't
think
when
i
asked
you
about
my
old
friend
i
should
strike
on
such
strange
metal
well
i
must
be
off
good-day
villiers
went
away
thinking
of
his
own
conceit
of
the
chinese
boxes
here
was
quaint
workmanship
indeed
iv
the
discovery
in
paul
street
a
few
months
after
villiers'
meeting
with
herbert
mr
clarke
was
sitting
as
usual
by
his
after-dinner
hearth
resolutely
guarding
his
fancies
from
wandering
in
the
direction
of
the
bureau
for
more
than
a
week
he
had
succeeded
in
keeping
away
from
the
memoirs
and
he
cherished
hopes
of
a
complete
self-reformation
but
in
spite
of
his
endeavours
he
could
not
hush
the
wonder
and
the
strange
curiosity
that
the
last
case
he
had
written
down
had
excited
within
him
he
had
put
the
case
or
rather
the
outline
of
it
conjecturally
to
a
scientific
friend
who
shook
his
head
and
thought
clarke
getting
queer
and
on
this
particular
evening
clarke
was
making
an
effort
to
rationalize
the
story
when
a
sudden
knock
at
the
door
roused
him
from
his
meditations
mr
villiers
to
see
you
sir
dear
me
villiers
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
look
me
up
i
have
not
seen
you
for
many
months
i
should
think
nearly
a
year
come
in
come
in
and
how
are
you
villiers
want
any
advice
about
investments
no
thanks
i
fancy
everything
i
have
in
that
way
is
pretty
safe
no
clarke
i
have
really
come
to
consult
you
about
a
rather
curious
matter
that
has
been
brought
under
my
notice
of
late
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
it
all
rather
absurd
when
i
tell
my
tale
i
sometimes
think
so
myself
and
that's
just
what
i
made
up
my
mind
to
come
to
you
as
i
know
you're
a
practical
man
mr
villiers
was
ignorant
of
the
memoirs
to
prove
the
existence
of
the
devil
well
villiers
i
shall
be
happy
to
give
you
my
advice
to
the
best
of
my
ability
what
is
the
nature
of
the
case
it's
an
extraordinary
thing
altogether
you
know
my
ways
i
always
keep
my
eyes
open
in
the
streets
and
in
my
time
i
have
chanced
upon
some
queer
customers
and
queer
cases
too
but
this
i
think
beats
all
i
was
coming
out
of
a
restaurant
one
nasty
winter
night
about
three
months
ago
i
had
had
a
capital
dinner
and
a
good
bottle
of
chianti
and
i
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
pavement
thinking
what
a
mystery
there
is
about
london
streets
and
the
companies
that
pass
along
them
a
bottle
of
red
wine
encourages
these
fancies
clarke
and
i
dare
say
i
should
have
thought
a
page
of
small
type
but
i
was
cut
short
by
a
beggar
who
had
come
behind
me
and
was
making
the
usual
appeals
of
course
i
looked
round
and
this
beggar
turned
out
to
be
what
was
left
of
an
old
friend
of
mine
a
man
named
herbert
i
asked
him
how
he
had
come
to
such
a
wretched
pass
and
he
told
me
we
walked
up
and
down
one
of
those
long
and
dark
soho
streets
and
there
i
listened
to
his
story
he
said
he
had
married
a
beautiful
girl
some
years
younger
than
himself
and
as
he
put
it
she
had
corrupted
him
body
and
soul
he
wouldn't
go
into
details
he
said
he
dare
not
that
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
haunted
him
by
night
and
day
and
when
i
looked
in
his
face
i
knew
he
was
speaking
the
truth
there
was
something
about
the
man
that
made
me
shiver
i
don't
know
why
but
it
was
there
i
gave
him
a
little
money
and
sent
him
away
and
i
assure
you
that
when
he
was
gone
i
gasped
for
breath
his
presence
seemed
to
chill
one's
blood
isn't
this
all
just
a
little
fanciful
villiers
i
suppose
the
poor
fellow
had
made
an
imprudent
marriage
and
in
plain
english
gone
to
the
bad
well
listen
to
this
villiers
told
clarke
the
story
he
had
heard
from
austin
you
see
he
concluded
there
can
be
but
little
doubt
that
this
mr
blank
whoever
he
was
died
of
sheer
terror
he
saw
something
so
awful
so
terrible
that
it
cut
short
his
life
and
what
he
saw
he
most
certainly
saw
in
that
house
which
somehow
or
other
had
got
a
bad
name
in
the
neighbourhood
i
had
the
curiosity
to
go
and
look
at
the
place
for
myself
it's
a
saddening
kind
of
street
the
houses
are
old
enough
to
be
mean
and
dreary
but
not
old
enough
to
be
quaint
as
far
as
i
could
see
most
of
them
are
let
in
lodgings
furnished
and
unfurnished
and
almost
every
door
has
three
bells
to
it
here
and
there
the
ground
floors
have
been
made
into
shops
of
the
commonest
kind
it's
a
dismal
street
in
every
way
i
found
number
20
was
to
let
and
i
went
to
the
agent's
and
got
the
key
of
course
i
should
have
heard
nothing
of
the
herberts
in
that
quarter
but
i
asked
the
man
fair
and
square
how
long
they
had
left
the
house
and
whether
there
had
been
other
tenants
in
the
meanwhile
he
looked
at
me
queerly
for
a
minute
and
told
me
the
herberts
had
left
immediately
after
the
unpleasantness
as
he
called
it
and
since
then
the
house
had
been
empty
mr
villiers
paused
for
a
moment
i
have
always
been
rather
fond
of
going
over
empty
houses
there's
a
sort
of
fascination
about
the
desolate
empty
rooms
with
the
nails
sticking
in
the
walls
and
the
dust
thick
upon
the
window-sills
but
i
didn't
enjoy
going
over
number
20
paul
street
i
had
hardly
put
my
foot
inside
the
passage
when
i
noticed
a
queer
heavy
feeling
about
the
air
of
the
house
of
course
all
empty
houses
are
stuffy
and
so
forth
but
this
was
something
quite
different
i
can't
describe
it
to
you
but
it
seemed
to
stop
the
breath
i
went
into
the
front
room
and
the
back
room
and
the
kitchens
downstairs
they
were
all
dirty
and
dusty
enough
as
you
would
expect
but
there
was
something
strange
about
them
all
i
couldn't
define
it
to
you
i
only
know
i
felt
queer
it
was
one
of
the
rooms
on
the
first
floor
though
that
was
the
worst
it
was
a
largish
room
and
once
on
a
time
the
paper
must
have
been
cheerful
enough
but
when
i
saw
it
paint
paper
and
everything
were
most
doleful
but
the
room
was
full
of
horror
i
felt
my
teeth
grinding
as
i
put
my
hand
on
the
door
and
when
i
went
in
i
thought
i
should
have
fallen
fainting
to
the
floor
however
i
pulled
myself
together
and
stood
against
the
end
wall
wondering
what
on
earth
there
could
be
about
the
room
to
make
my
limbs
tremble
and
my
heart
beat
as
if
i
were
at
the
hour
of
death
in
one
corner
there
was
a
pile
of
newspapers
littered
on
the
floor
and
i
began
looking
at
them
they
were
papers
of
three
or
four
years
ago
some
of
them
half
torn
and
some
crumpled
as
if
they
had
been
used
for
packing
i
turned
the
whole
pile
over
and
amongst
them
i
found
a
curious
drawing
i
will
show
it
to
you
presently
but
i
couldn't
stay
in
the
room
i
felt
it
was
overpowering
me
i
was
thankful
to
come
out
safe
and
sound
into
the
open
air
people
stared
at
me
as
i
walked
along
the
street
and
one
man
said
i
was
drunk
i
was
staggering
about
from
one
side
of
the
pavement
to
the
other
and
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
take
the
key
back
to
the
agent
and
get
home
i
was
in
bed
for
a
week
suffering
from
what
my
doctor
called
nervous
shock
and
exhaustion
one
of
those
days
i
was
reading
the
evening
paper
and
happened
to
notice
a
paragraph
headed
'starved
to
death'
it
was
the
usual
style
of
thing
a
model
lodging-house
in
marylebone
a
door
locked
for
several
days
and
a
dead
man
in
his
chair
when
they
broke
in
'the
deceased'
said
the
paragraph
'was
known
as
charles
herbert
and
is
believed
to
have
been
once
a
prosperous
country
gentleman
his
name
was
familiar
to
the
public
three
years
ago
in
connection
with
the
mysterious
death
in
paul
street
tottenham
court
road
the
deceased
being
the
tenant
of
the
house
number
20
in
the
area
of
which
a
gentleman
of
good
position
was
found
dead
under
circumstances
not
devoid
of
suspicion'
a
tragic
ending
wasn't
it
but
after
all
if
what
he
told
me
were
true
which
i
am
sure
it
was
the
man's
life
was
all
a
tragedy
and
a
tragedy
of
a
stranger
sort
than
they
put
on
the
boards
and
that
is
the
story
is
it
said
clarke
musingly
yes
that
is
the
story
well
really
villiers
i
scarcely
know
what
to
say
about
it
there
are
no
doubt
circumstances
in
the
case
which
seem
peculiar
the
finding
of
the
dead
man
in
the
area
of
herbert's
house
for
instance
and
the
extraordinary
opinion
of
the
physician
as
to
the
cause
of
death
but
after
all
it
is
conceivable
that
the
facts
may
be
explained
in
a
straightforward
manner
as
to
your
own
sensations
when
you
went
to
see
the
house
i
would
suggest
that
they
were
due
to
a
vivid
imagination
you
must
have
been
brooding
in
a
semi-conscious
way
over
what
you
had
heard
i
don't
exactly
see
what
more
can
be
said
or
done
in
the
matter
you
evidently
think
there
is
a
mystery
of
some
kind
but
herbert
is
dead
where
then
do
you
propose
to
look
i
propose
to
look
for
the
woman
the
woman
whom
he
married
she
is
the
mystery
the
two
men
sat
silent
by
the
fireside
clarke
secretly
congratulating
himself
on
having
successfully
kept
up
the
character
of
advocate
of
the
commonplace
and
villiers
wrapped
in
his
gloomy
fancies
i
think
i
will
have
a
cigarette
he
said
at
last
and
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
to
feel
for
the
cigarette-case
ah
he
said
starting
slightly
i
forgot
i
had
something
to
show
you
you
remember
my
saying
that
i
had
found
a
rather
curious
sketch
amongst
the
pile
of
old
newspapers
at
the
house
in
paul
street
here
it
is
villiers
drew
out
a
small
thin
parcel
from
his
pocket
it
was
covered
with
brown
paper
and
secured
with
string
and
the
knots
were
troublesome
in
spite
of
himself
clarke
felt
inquisitive
he
bent
forward
on
his
chair
as
villiers
painfully
undid
the
string
and
unfolded
the
outer
covering
inside
was
a
second
wrapping
of
tissue
and
villiers
took
it
off
and
handed
the
small
piece
of
paper
to
clarke
without
a
word
there
was
dead
silence
in
the
room
for
five
minutes
or
more
the
two
men
sat
so
still
that
they
could
hear
the
ticking
of
the
tall
old-fashioned
clock
that
stood
outside
in
the
hall
and
in
the
mind
of
one
of
them
the
slow
monotony
of
sound
woke
up
a
far
far
memory
he
was
looking
intently
at
the
small
pen-and-ink
sketch
of
the
woman's
head
it
had
evidently
been
drawn
with
great
care
and
by
a
true
artist
for
the
woman's
soul
looked
out
of
the
eyes
and
the
lips
were
parted
with
a
strange
smile
clarke
gazed
still
at
the
face
it
brought
to
his
memory
one
summer
evening
long
ago
he
saw
again
the
long
lovely
valley
the
river
winding
between
the
hills
the
meadows
and
the
cornfields
the
dull
red
sun
and
the
cold
white
mist
rising
from
the
water
he
heard
a
voice
speaking
to
him
across
the
waves
of
many
years
and
saying
clarke
mary
will
see
the
god
pan
and
then
he
was
standing
in
the
grim
room
beside
the
doctor
listening
to
the
heavy
ticking
of
the
clock
waiting
and
watching
watching
the
figure
lying
on
the
green
chair
beneath
the
lamplight
mary
rose
up
and
he
looked
into
her
eyes
and
his
heart
grew
cold
within
him
who
is
this
woman
he
said
at
last
his
voice
was
dry
and
hoarse
that
is
the
woman
who
herbert
married
clarke
looked
again
at
the
sketch
it
was
not
mary
after
all
there
certainly
was
mary's
face
but
there
was
something
else
something
he
had
not
seen
on
mary's
features
when
the
white-clad
girl
entered
the
laboratory
with
the
doctor
nor
at
her
terrible
awakening
nor
when
she
lay
grinning
on
the
bed
whatever
it
was
the
glance
that
came
from
those
eyes
the
smile
on
the
full
lips
or
the
expression
of
the
whole
face
clarke
shuddered
before
it
at
his
inmost
soul
and
thought
unconsciously
of
dr
phillip's
words
the
most
vivid
presentment
of
evil
i
have
ever
seen
he
turned
the
paper
over
mechanically
in
his
hand
and
glanced
at
the
back
good
god
clarke
what
is
the
matter
you
are
as
white
as
death
villiers
had
started
wildly
from
his
chair
as
clarke
fell
back
with
a
groan
and
let
the
paper
drop
from
his
hands
i
don't
feel
very
well
villiers
i
am
subject
to
these
attacks
pour
me
out
a
little
wine
thanks
that
will
do
i
shall
feel
better
in
a
few
minutes
villiers
picked
up
the
fallen
sketch
and
turned
it
over
as
clarke
had
done
you
saw
that
he
said
that's
how
i
identified
it
as
being
a
portrait
of
herbert's
wife
or
i
should
say
his
widow
how
do
you
feel
now
better
thanks
it
was
only
a
passing
faintness
i
don't
think
i
quite
catch
your
meaning
what
did
you
say
enabled
you
to
identify
the
picture
this
word--'helen'--was
written
on
the
back
didn't
i
tell
you
her
name
was
helen
yes
helen
vaughan
clarke
groaned
there
could
be
no
shadow
of
doubt
now
don't
you
agree
with
me
said
villiers
that
in
the
story
i
have
told
you
to-night
and
in
the
part
this
woman
plays
in
it
there
are
some
very
strange
points
yes
villiers
clarke
muttered
it
is
a
strange
story
indeed
a
strange
story
indeed
you
must
give
me
time
to
think
it
over
i
may
be
able
to
help
you
or
i
may
not
must
you
be
going
now
well
good-night
villiers
good-night
come
and
see
me
in
the
course
of
a
week
v
the
letter
of
advice
do
you
know
austin
said
villiers
as
the
two
friends
were
pacing
sedately
along
piccadilly
one
pleasant
morning
in
may
do
you
know
i
am
convinced
that
what
you
told
me
about
paul
street
and
the
herberts
is
a
mere
episode
in
an
extraordinary
history
i
may
as
well
confess
to
you
that
when
i
asked
you
about
herbert
a
few
months
ago
i
had
just
seen
him
you
had
seen
him
where
he
begged
of
me
in
the
street
one
night
he
was
in
the
most
pitiable
plight
but
i
recognized
the
man
and
i
got
him
to
tell
me
his
history
or
at
least
the
outline
of
it
in
brief
it
amounted
to
this--he
had
been
ruined
by
his
wife
in
what
manner
he
would
not
tell
me
he
would
only
say
that
she
had
destroyed
him
body
and
soul
the
man
is
dead
now
and
what
has
become
of
his
wife
ah
that's
what
i
should
like
to
know
and
i
mean
to
find
her
sooner
or
later
i
know
a
man
named
clarke
a
dry
fellow
in
fact
a
man
of
business
but
shrewd
enough
you
understand
my
meaning
not
shrewd
in
the
mere
business
sense
of
the
word
but
a
man
who
really
knows
something
about
men
and
life
well
i
laid
the
case
before
him
and
he
was
evidently
impressed
he
said
it
needed
consideration
and
asked
me
to
come
again
in
the
course
of
a
week
a
few
days
later
i
received
this
extraordinary
letter
austin
took
the
envelope
drew
out
the
letter
and
read
it
curiously
it
ran
as
follows--
my
dear
villiers--i
have
thought
over
the
matter
on
which
you
consulted
me
the
other
night
and
my
advice
to
you
is
this
throw
the
portrait
into
the
fire
blot
out
the
story
from
your
mind
never
give
it
another
thought
villiers
or
you
will
be
sorry
you
will
think
no
doubt
that
i
am
in
possession
of
some
secret
information
and
to
a
certain
extent
that
is
the
case
but
i
only
know
a
little
i
am
like
a
traveller
who
has
peered
over
an
abyss
and
has
drawn
back
in
terror
what
i
know
is
strange
enough
and
horrible
enough
but
beyond
my
knowledge
there
are
depths
and
horrors
more
frightful
still
more
incredible
than
any
tale
told
of
winter
nights
about
the
fire
i
have
resolved
and
nothing
shall
shake
that
resolve
to
explore
no
whit
farther
and
if
you
value
your
happiness
you
will
make
the
same
determination
come
and
see
me
by
all
means
but
we
will
talk
on
more
cheerful
topics
than
this
austin
folded
the
letter
methodically
and
returned
it
to
villiers
it
is
certainly
an
extraordinary
letter
he
said
what
does
he
mean
by
the
portrait
ah
i
forgot
to
tell
you
i
have
been
to
paul
street
and
have
made
a
discovery
villiers
told
his
story
as
he
had
told
it
to
clarke
and
austin
listened
in
silence
he
seemed
puzzled
how
very
curious
that
you
should
experience
such
an
unpleasant
sensation
in
that
room
he
said
at
length
i
hardly
gather
that
it
was
a
mere
matter
of
the
imagination
a
feeling
of
repulsion
in
short
no
it
was
more
physical
than
mental
it
was
as
if
i
were
inhaling
at
every
breath
some
deadly
fume
which
seemed
to
penetrate
to
every
nerve
and
bone
and
sinew
of
my
body
i
felt
racked
from
head
to
foot
my
eyes
began
to
grow
dim
it
was
like
the
entrance
of
death
yes
yes
very
strange
certainly
you
see
your
friend
confesses
that
there
is
some
very
black
story
connected
with
this
woman
did
you
notice
any
particular
emotion
in
him
when
you
were
telling
your
tale
yes
i
did
he
became
very
faint
but
he
assured
me
that
it
was
a
mere
passing
attack
to
which
he
was
subject
did
you
believe
him
i
did
at
the
time
but
i
don't
now
he
heard
what
i
had
to
say
with
a
good
deal
of
indifference
till
i
showed
him
the
portrait
it
was
then
that
he
was
seized
with
the
attack
of
which
i
spoke
he
looked
ghastly
i
assure
you
then
he
must
have
seen
the
woman
before
but
there
might
be
another
explanation
it
might
have
been
the
name
and
not
the
face
which
was
familiar
to
him
what
do
you
think
i
couldn't
say
to
the
best
of
my
belief
it
was
after
turning
the
portrait
in
his
hands
that
he
nearly
dropped
from
the
chair
the
name
you
know
was
written
on
the
back
quite
so
after
all
it
is
impossible
to
come
to
any
resolution
in
a
case
like
this
i
hate
melodrama
and
nothing
strikes
me
as
more
commonplace
and
tedious
than
the
ordinary
ghost
story
of
commerce
but
really
villiers
it
looks
as
if
there
were
something
very
queer
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
the
two
men
had
without
noticing
it
turned
up
ashley
street
leading
northward
from
piccadilly
it
was
a
long
street
and
rather
a
gloomy
one
but
here
and
there
a
brighter
taste
had
illuminated
the
dark
houses
with
flowers
and
gay
curtains
and
a
cheerful
paint
on
the
doors
villiers
glanced
up
as
austin
stopped
speaking
and
looked
at
one
of
these
houses
geraniums
red
and
white
drooped
from
every
sill
and
daffodil-coloured
curtains
were
draped
back
from
each
window
it
looks
cheerful
doesn't
it
he
said
yes
and
the
inside
is
still
more
cheery
one
of
the
pleasantest
houses
of
the
season
so
i
have
heard
i
haven't
been
there
myself
but
i've
met
several
men
who
have
and
they
tell
me
it's
uncommonly
jovial
whose
house
is
it
a
mrs
beaumont's
and
who
is
she
i
couldn't
tell
you
i
have
heard
she
comes
from
south
america
but
after
all
who
she
is
is
of
little
consequence
she
is
a
very
wealthy
woman
there's
no
doubt
of
that
and
some
of
the
best
people
have
taken
her
up
i
hear
she
has
some
wonderful
claret
really
marvellous
wine
which
must
have
cost
a
fabulous
sum
lord
argentine
was
telling
me
about
it
he
was
there
last
sunday
evening
he
assures
me
he
has
never
tasted
such
a
wine
and
argentine
as
you
know
is
an
expert
by
the
way
that
reminds
me
she
must
be
an
oddish
sort
of
woman
this
mrs
beaumont
argentine
asked
her
how
old
the
wine
was
and
what
do
you
think
she
said
'about
a
thousand
years
i
believe'
lord
argentine
thought
she
was
chaffing
him
you
know
but
when
he
laughed
she
said
she
was
speaking
quite
seriously
and
offered
to
show
him
the
jar
of
course
he
couldn't
say
anything
more
after
that
but
it
seems
rather
antiquated
for
a
beverage
doesn't
it
why
here
we
are
at
my
rooms
come
in
won't
you
thanks
i
think
i
will
i
haven't
seen
the
curiosity-shop
for
a
while
it
was
a
room
furnished
richly
yet
oddly
where
every
jar
and
bookcase
and
table
and
every
rug
and
jar
and
ornament
seemed
to
be
a
thing
apart
preserving
each
its
own
individuality
anything
fresh
lately
said
villiers
after
a
while
no
i
think
not
you
saw
those
queer
jugs
didn't
you
i
thought
so
i
don't
think
i
have
come
across
anything
for
the
last
few
weeks
austin
glanced
around
the
room
from
cupboard
to
cupboard
from
shelf
to
shelf
in
search
of
some
new
oddity
his
eyes
fell
at
last
on
an
odd
chest
pleasantly
and
quaintly
carved
which
stood
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
ah
he
said
i
was
forgetting
i
have
got
something
to
show
you
austin
unlocked
the
chest
drew
out
a
thick
quarto
volume
laid
it
on
the
table
and
resumed
the
cigar
he
had
put
down
did
you
know
arthur
meyrick
the
painter
villiers
a
little
i
met
him
two
or
three
times
at
the
house
of
a
friend
of
mine
what
has
become
of
him
i
haven't
heard
his
name
mentioned
for
some
time
he's
dead
you
don't
say
so
quite
young
wasn't
he
yes
only
thirty
when
he
died
what
did
he
die
of
i
don't
know
he
was
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
and
a
thoroughly
good
fellow
he
used
to
come
here
and
talk
to
me
for
hours
and
he
was
one
of
the
best
talkers
i
have
met
he
could
even
talk
about
painting
and
that's
more
than
can
be
said
of
most
painters
about
eighteen
months
ago
he
was
feeling
rather
overworked
and
partly
at
my
suggestion
he
went
off
on
a
sort
of
roving
expedition
with
no
very
definite
end
or
aim
about
it
i
believe
new
york
was
to
be
his
first
port
but
i
never
heard
from
him
three
months
ago
i
got
this
book
with
a
very
civil
letter
from
an
english
doctor
practising
at
buenos
ayres
stating
that
he
had
attended
the
late
mr
meyrick
during
his
illness
and
that
the
deceased
had
expressed
an
earnest
wish
that
the
enclosed
packet
should
be
sent
to
me
after
his
death
that
was
all
and
haven't
you
written
for
further
particulars
i
have
been
thinking
of
doing
so
you
would
advise
me
to
write
to
the
doctor
certainly
and
what
about
the
book
it
was
sealed
up
when
i
got
it
i
don't
think
the
doctor
had
seen
it
it
is
something
very
rare
meyrick
was
a
collector
perhaps
no
i
think
not
hardly
a
collector
now
what
do
you
think
of
these
ainu
jugs
they
are
peculiar
but
i
like
them
but
aren't
you
going
to
show
me
poor
meyrick's
legacy
yes
yes
to
be
sure
the
fact
is
it's
rather
a
peculiar
sort
of
thing
and
i
haven't
shown
it
to
any
one
i
wouldn't
say
anything
about
it
if
i
were
you
there
it
is
villiers
took
the
book
and
opened
it
at
haphazard
it
isn't
a
printed
volume
then
he
said
no
it
is
a
collection
of
drawings
in
black
and
white
by
my
poor
friend
meyrick
villiers
turned
to
the
first
page
it
was
blank
the
second
bore
a
brief
inscription
which
he
read
silet
per
diem
universus
nec
sine
horrore
secretus
est
lucet
nocturnis
ignibus
chorus
aegipanum
undique
personatur
audiuntur
et
cantus
tibiarum
et
tinnitus
cymbalorum
per
oram
maritimam
on
the
third
page
was
a
design
which
made
villiers
start
and
look
up
at
austin
he
was
gazing
abstractedly
out
of
the
window
villiers
turned
page
after
page
absorbed
in
spite
of
himself
in
the
frightful
walpurgis
night
of
evil
strange
monstrous
evil
that
the
dead
artist
had
set
forth
in
hard
black
and
white
the
figures
of
fauns
and
satyrs
and
aegipans
danced
before
his
eyes
the
darkness
of
the
thicket
the
dance
on
the
mountain-top
the
scenes
by
lonely
shores
in
green
vineyards
by
rocks
and
desert
places
passed
before
him
a
world
before
which
the
human
soul
seemed
to
shrink
back
and
shudder
villiers
whirled
over
the
remaining
pages
he
had
seen
enough
but
the
picture
on
the
last
leaf
caught
his
eye
as
he
almost
closed
the
book
austin
well
what
is
it
do
you
know
who
that
is
it
was
a
woman's
face
alone
on
the
white
page
know
who
it
is
no
of
course
not
i
do
who
is
it
it
is
mrs
herbert
are
you
sure
i
am
perfectly
sure
of
it
poor
meyrick
he
is
one
more
chapter
in
her
history
but
what
do
you
think
of
the
designs
they
are
frightful
lock
the
book
up
again
austin
if
i
were
you
i
would
burn
it
it
must
be
a
terrible
companion
even
though
it
be
in
a
chest
yes
they
are
singular
drawings
but
i
wonder
what
connection
there
could
be
between
meyrick
and
mrs
herbert
or
what
link
between
her
and
these
designs
ah
who
can
say
it
is
possible
that
the
matter
may
end
here
and
we
shall
never
know
but
in
my
own
opinion
this
helen
vaughan
or
mrs
herbert
is
only
the
beginning
she
will
come
back
to
london
austin
depend
on
it
she
will
come
back
and
we
shall
hear
more
about
her
then
i
doubt
it
will
be
very
pleasant
news
vi
the
suicides
lord
argentine
was
a
great
favourite
in
london
society
at
twenty
he
had
been
a
poor
man
decked
with
the
surname
of
an
illustrious
family
but
forced
to
earn
a
livelihood
as
best
he
could
and
the
most
speculative
of
money-lenders
would
not
have
entrusted
him
with
fifty
pounds
on
the
chance
of
his
ever
changing
his
name
for
a
title
and
his
poverty
for
a
great
fortune
his
father
had
been
near
enough
to
the
fountain
of
good
things
to
secure
one
of
the
family
livings
but
the
son
even
if
he
had
taken
orders
would
scarcely
have
obtained
so
much
as
this
and
moreover
felt
no
vocation
for
the
ecclesiastical
estate
thus
he
fronted
the
world
with
no
better
armour
than
the
bachelor's
gown
and
the
wits
of
a
younger
son's
grandson
with
which
equipment
he
contrived
in
some
way
to
make
a
very
tolerable
fight
of
it
at
twenty-five
mr
charles
aubernon
saw
himself
still
a
man
of
struggles
and
of
warfare
with
the
world
but
out
of
the
seven
who
stood
before
him
and
the
high
places
of
his
family
three
only
remained
these
three
however
were
good
lives
but
yet
not
proof
against
the
zulu
assegais
and
typhoid
fever
and
so
one
morning
aubernon
woke
up
and
found
himself
lord
argentine
a
man
of
thirty
who
had
faced
the
difficulties
of
existence
and
had
conquered
the
situation
amused
him
immensely
and
he
resolved
that
riches
should
be
as
pleasant
to
him
as
poverty
had
always
been
argentine
after
some
little
consideration
came
to
the
conclusion
that
dining
regarded
as
a
fine
art
was
perhaps
the
most
amusing
pursuit
open
to
fallen
humanity
and
thus
his
dinners
became
famous
in
london
and
an
invitation
to
his
table
a
thing
covetously
desired
after
ten
years
of
lordship
and
dinners
argentine
still
declined
to
be
jaded
still
persisted
in
enjoying
life
and
by
a
kind
of
infection
had
become
recognized
as
the
cause
of
joy
in
others
in
short
as
the
best
of
company
his
sudden
and
tragical
death
therefore
caused
a
wide
and
deep
sensation
people
could
scarcely
believe
it
even
though
the
newspaper
was
before
their
eyes
and
the
cry
of
mysterious
death
of
a
nobleman
came
ringing
up
from
the
street
but
there
stood
the
brief
paragraph
lord
argentine
was
found
dead
this
morning
by
his
valet
under
distressing
circumstances
it
is
stated
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
his
lordship
committed
suicide
though
no
motive
can
be
assigned
for
the
act
the
deceased
nobleman
was
widely
known
in
society
and
much
liked
for
his
genial
manner
and
sumptuous
hospitality
he
is
succeeded
by
etc
etc
by
slow
degrees
the
details
came
to
light
but
the
case
still
remained
a
mystery
the
chief
witness
at
the
inquest
was
the
deceased's
valet
who
said
that
the
night
before
his
death
lord
argentine
had
dined
with
a
lady
of
good
position
whose
name
was
suppressed
in
the
newspaper
reports
at
about
eleven
o'clock
lord
argentine
had
returned
and
informed
his
man
that
he
should
not
require
his
services
till
the
next
morning
a
little
later
the
valet
had
occasion
to
cross
the
hall
and
was
somewhat
astonished
to
see
his
master
quietly
letting
himself
out
at
the
front
door
he
had
taken
off
his
evening
clothes
and
was
dressed
in
a
norfolk
coat
and
knickerbockers
and
wore
a
low
brown
hat
the
valet
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
lord
argentine
had
seen
him
and
though
his
master
rarely
kept
late
hours
thought
little
of
the
occurrence
till
the
next
morning
when
he
knocked
at
the
bedroom
door
at
a
quarter
to
nine
as
usual
he
received
no
answer
and
after
knocking
two
or
three
times
entered
the
room
and
saw
lord
argentine's
body
leaning
forward
at
an
angle
from
the
bottom
of
the
bed
he
found
that
his
master
had
tied
a
cord
securely
to
one
of
the
short
bed-posts
and
after
making
a
running
noose
and
slipping
it
round
his
neck
the
unfortunate
man
must
have
resolutely
fallen
forward
to
die
by
slow
strangulation
he
was
dressed
in
the
light
suit
in
which
the
valet
had
seen
him
go
out
and
the
doctor
who
was
summoned
pronounced
that
life
had
been
extinct
for
more
than
four
hours
all
papers
letters
and
so
forth
seemed
in
perfect
order
and
nothing
was
discovered
which
pointed
in
the
most
remote
way
to
any
scandal
either
great
or
small
here
the
evidence
ended
nothing
more
could
be
discovered
several
persons
had
been
present
at
the
dinner-party
at
which
lord
argentine
had
assisted
and
to
all
these
he
seemed
in
his
usual
genial
spirits
the
valet
indeed
said
he
thought
his
master
appeared
a
little
excited
when
he
came
home
but
confessed
that
the
alteration
in
his
manner
was
very
slight
hardly
noticeable
indeed
it
seemed
hopeless
to
seek
for
any
clue
and
the
suggestion
that
lord
argentine
had
been
suddenly
attacked
by
acute
suicidal
mania
was
generally
accepted
it
was
otherwise
however
when
within
three
weeks
three
more
gentlemen
one
of
them
a
nobleman
and
the
two
others
men
of
good
position
and
ample
means
perished
miserably
in
the
almost
precisely
the
same
manner
lord
swanleigh
was
found
one
morning
in
his
dressing-room
hanging
from
a
peg
affixed
to
the
wall
and
mr
collier-stuart
and
mr
herries
had
chosen
to
die
as
lord
argentine
there
was
no
explanation
in
either
case
a
few
bald
facts
a
living
man
in
the
evening
and
a
body
with
a
black
swollen
face
in
the
morning
the
police
had
been
forced
to
confess
themselves
powerless
to
arrest
or
to
explain
the
sordid
murders
of
whitechapel
but
before
the
horrible
suicides
of
piccadilly
and
mayfair
they
were
dumbfoundered
for
not
even
the
mere
ferocity
which
did
duty
as
an
explanation
of
the
crimes
of
the
east
end
could
be
of
service
in
the
west
each
of
these
men
who
had
resolved
to
die
a
tortured
shameful
death
was
rich
prosperous
and
to
all
appearances
in
love
with
the
world
and
not
the
acutest
research
should
ferret
out
any
shadow
of
a
lurking
motive
in
either
case
there
was
a
horror
in
the
air
and
men
looked
at
one
another's
faces
when
they
met
each
wondering
whether
the
other
was
to
be
the
victim
of
the
fifth
nameless
tragedy
journalists
sought
in
vain
for
their
scrapbooks
for
materials
whereof
to
concoct
reminiscent
articles
and
the
morning
paper
was
unfolded
in
many
a
house
with
a
feeling
of
awe
no
man
knew
when
or
where
the
next
blow
would
light
a
short
while
after
the
last
of
these
terrible
events
austin
came
to
see
mr
villiers
he
was
curious
to
know
whether
villiers
had
succeeded
in
discovering
any
fresh
traces
of
mrs
herbert
either
through
clarke
or
by
other
sources
and
he
asked
the
question
soon
after
he
had
sat
down
no
said
villiers
i
wrote
to
clarke
but
he
remains
obdurate
and
i
have
tried
other
channels
but
without
any
result
i
can't
find
out
what
became
of
helen
vaughan
after
she
left
paul
street
but
i
think
she
must
have
gone
abroad
but
to
tell
the
truth
austin
i
haven't
paid
much
attention
to
the
matter
for
the
last
few
weeks
i
knew
poor
herries
intimately
and
his
terrible
death
has
been
a
great
shock
to
me
a
great
shock
i
can
well
believe
it
answered
austin
gravely
you
know
argentine
was
a
friend
of
mine
if
i
remember
rightly
we
were
speaking
of
him
that
day
you
came
to
my
rooms
yes
it
was
in
connection
with
that
house
in
ashley
street
mrs
beaumont's
house
you
said
something
about
argentine's
dining
there
quite
so
of
course
you
know
it
was
there
argentine
dined
the
night
before--before
his
death
no
i
had
not
heard
that
oh
yes
the
name
was
kept
out
of
the
papers
to
spare
mrs
beaumont
argentine
was
a
great
favourite
of
hers
and
it
is
said
she
was
in
a
terrible
state
for
sometime
after
a
curious
look
came
over
villiers'
face
he
seemed
undecided
whether
to
speak
or
not
austin
began
again
i
never
experienced
such
a
feeling
of
horror
as
when
i
read
the
account
of
argentine's
death
i
didn't
understand
it
at
the
time
and
i
don't
now
i
knew
him
well
and
it
completely
passes
my
understanding
for
what
possible
cause
he--or
any
of
the
others
for
the
matter
of
that--could
have
resolved
in
cold
blood
to
die
in
such
an
awful
manner
you
know
how
men
babble
away
each
other's
characters
in
london
you
may
be
sure
any
buried
scandal
or
hidden
skeleton
would
have
been
brought
to
light
in
such
a
case
as
this
but
nothing
of
the
sort
has
taken
place
as
for
the
theory
of
mania
that
is
very
well
of
course
for
the
coroner's
jury
but
everybody
knows
that
it's
all
nonsense
suicidal
mania
is
not
small-pox
austin
relapsed
into
gloomy
silence
villiers
sat
silent
also
watching
his
friend
the
expression
of
indecision
still
fleeted
across
his
face
he
seemed
as
if
weighing
his
thoughts
in
the
balance
and
the
considerations
he
was
resolving
left
him
still
silent
austin
tried
to
shake
off
the
remembrance
of
tragedies
as
hopeless
and
perplexed
as
the
labyrinth
of
daedalus
and
began
to
talk
in
an
indifferent
voice
of
the
more
pleasant
incidents
and
adventures
of
the
season
that
mrs
beaumont
he
said
of
whom
we
were
speaking
is
a
great
success
she
has
taken
london
almost
by
storm
i
met
her
the
other
night
at
fulham's
she
is
really
a
remarkable
woman
you
have
met
mrs
beaumont
yes
she
had
quite
a
court
around
her
she
would
be
called
very
handsome
i
suppose
and
yet
there
is
something
about
her
face
which
i
didn't
like
the
features
are
exquisite
but
the
expression
is
strange
and
all
the
time
i
was
looking
at
her
and
afterwards
when
i
was
going
home
i
had
a
curious
feeling
that
very
expression
was
in
some
way
or
another
familiar
to
me
you
must
have
seen
her
in
the
row
no
i
am
sure
i
never
set
eyes
on
the
woman
before
it
is
that
which
makes
it
puzzling
and
to
the
best
of
my
belief
i
have
never
seen
anyone
like
her
what
i
felt
was
a
kind
of
dim
far-off
memory
vague
but
persistent
the
only
sensation
i
can
compare
it
to
is
that
odd
feeling
one
sometimes
has
in
a
dream
when
fantastic
cities
and
wondrous
lands
and
phantom
personages
appear
familiar
and
accustomed
villiers
nodded
and
glanced
aimlessly
round
the
room
possibly
in
search
of
something
on
which
to
turn
the
conversation
his
eyes
fell
on
an
old
chest
somewhat
like
that
in
which
the
artist's
strange
legacy
lay
hid
beneath
a
gothic
scutcheon
have
you
written
to
the
doctor
about
poor
meyrick
he
asked
yes
i
wrote
asking
for
full
particulars
as
to
his
illness
and
death
i
don't
expect
to
have
an
answer
for
another
three
weeks
or
a
month
i
thought
i
might
as
well
inquire
whether
meyrick
knew
an
englishwoman
named
herbert
and
if
so
whether
the
doctor
could
give
me
any
information
about
her
but
it's
very
possible
that
meyrick
fell
in
with
her
at
new
york
or
mexico
or
san
francisco
i
have
no
idea
as
to
the
extent
or
direction
of
his
travels
yes
and
it's
very
possible
that
the
woman
may
have
more
than
one
name
exactly
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
asking
you
to
lend
me
the
portrait
of
her
which
you
possess
i
might
have
enclosed
it
in
my
letter
to
dr
matthews
so
you
might
that
never
occurred
to
me
we
might
send
it
now
hark
what
are
those
boys
calling
while
the
two
men
had
been
talking
together
a
confused
noise
of
shouting
had
been
gradually
growing
louder
the
noise
rose
from
the
eastward
and
swelled
down
piccadilly
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
a
very
torrent
of
sound
surging
up
streets
usually
quiet
and
making
every
window
a
frame
for
a
face
curious
or
excited
the
cries
and
voices
came
echoing
up
the
silent
street
where
villiers
lived
growing
more
distinct
as
they
advanced
and
as
villiers
spoke
an
answer
rang
up
from
the
pavement
the
west
end
horrors
another
awful
suicide
full
details
austin
rushed
down
the
stairs
and
bought
a
paper
and
read
out
the
paragraph
to
villiers
as
the
uproar
in
the
street
rose
and
fell
the
window
was
open
and
the
air
seemed
full
of
noise
and
terror
another
gentleman
has
fallen
a
victim
to
the
terrible
epidemic
of
suicide
which
for
the
last
month
has
prevailed
in
the
west
end
mr
sidney
crashaw
of
stoke
house
fulham
and
king's
pomeroy
devon
was
found
after
a
prolonged
search
hanging
dead
from
the
branch
of
a
tree
in
his
garden
at
one
o'clock
today
the
deceased
gentleman
dined
last
night
at
the
carlton
club
and
seemed
in
his
usual
health
and
spirits
he
left
the
club
at
about
ten
o'clock
and
was
seen
walking
leisurely
up
st
james's
street
a
little
later
subsequent
to
this
his
movements
cannot
be
traced
on
the
discovery
of
the
body
medical
aid
was
at
once
summoned
but
life
had
evidently
been
long
extinct
so
far
as
is
known
mr
crashaw
had
no
trouble
or
anxiety
of
any
kind
this
painful
suicide
it
will
be
remembered
is
the
fifth
of
the
kind
in
the
last
month
the
authorities
at
scotland
yard
are
unable
to
suggest
any
explanation
of
these
terrible
occurrences
austin
put
down
the
paper
in
mute
horror
i
shall
leave
london
to-morrow
he
said
it
is
a
city
of
nightmares
how
awful
this
is
villiers
mr
villiers
was
sitting
by
the
window
quietly
looking
out
into
the
street
he
had
listened
to
the
newspaper
report
attentively
and
the
hint
of
indecision
was
no
longer
on
his
face
wait
a
moment
austin
he
replied
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
mention
a
little
matter
that
occurred
last
night
it
stated
i
think
that
crashaw
was
last
seen
alive
in
st
james's
street
shortly
after
ten
yes
i
think
so
i
will
look
again
yes
you
are
quite
right
quite
so
well
i
am
in
a
position
to
contradict
that
statement
at
all
events
crashaw
was
seen
after
that
considerably
later
indeed
how
do
you
know
because
i
happened
to
see
crashaw
myself
at
about
two
o'clock
this
morning
you
saw
crashaw
you
villiers
yes
i
saw
him
quite
distinctly
indeed
there
were
but
a
few
feet
between
us
where
in
heaven's
name
did
you
see
him
not
far
from
here
i
saw
him
in
ashley
street
he
was
just
leaving
a
house
did
you
notice
what
house
it
was
yes
it
was
mrs
beaumont's
villiers
think
what
you
are
saying
there
must
be
some
mistake
how
could
crashaw
be
in
mrs
beaumont's
house
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
surely
surely
you
must
have
been
dreaming
villiers
you
were
always
rather
fanciful
no
i
was
wide
awake
enough
even
if
i
had
been
dreaming
as
you
say
what
i
saw
would
have
roused
me
effectually
what
you
saw
what
did
you
see
was
there
anything
strange
about
crashaw
but
i
can't
believe
it
it
is
impossible
well
if
you
like
i
will
tell
you
what
i
saw
or
if
you
please
what
i
think
i
saw
and
you
can
judge
for
yourself
very
good
villiers
the
noise
and
clamour
of
the
street
had
died
away
though
now
and
then
the
sound
of
shouting
still
came
from
the
distance
and
the
dull
leaden
silence
seemed
like
the
quiet
after
an
earthquake
or
a
storm
villiers
turned
from
the
window
and
began
speaking
i
was
at
a
house
near
regent's
park
last
night
and
when
i
came
away
the
fancy
took
me
to
walk
home
instead
of
taking
a
hansom
it
was
a
clear
pleasant
night
enough
and
after
a
few
minutes
i
had
the
streets
pretty
much
to
myself
it's
a
curious
thing
austin
to
be
alone
in
london
at
night
the
gas-lamps
stretching
away
in
perspective
and
the
dead
silence
and
then
perhaps
the
rush
and
clatter
of
a
hansom
on
the
stones
and
the
fire
starting
up
under
the
horse's
hoofs
i
walked
along
pretty
briskly
for
i
was
feeling
a
little
tired
of
being
out
in
the
night
and
as
the
clocks
were
striking
two
i
turned
down
ashley
street
which
you
know
is
on
my
way
it
was
quieter
than
ever
there
and
the
lamps
were
fewer
altogether
it
looked
as
dark
and
gloomy
as
a
forest
in
winter
i
had
done
about
half
the
length
of
the
street
when
i
heard
a
door
closed
very
softly
and
naturally
i
looked
up
to
see
who
was
abroad
like
myself
at
such
an
hour
as
it
happens
there
is
a
street
lamp
close
to
the
house
in
question
and
i
saw
a
man
standing
on
the
step
he
had
just
shut
the
door
and
his
face
was
towards
me
and
i
recognized
crashaw
directly
i
never
knew
him
to
speak
to
but
i
had
often
seen
him
and
i
am
positive
that
i
was
not
mistaken
in
my
man
i
looked
into
his
face
for
a
moment
and
then--i
will
confess
the
truth--i
set
off
at
a
good
run
and
kept
it
up
till
i
was
within
my
own
door
why
why
because
it
made
my
blood
run
cold
to
see
that
man's
face
i
could
never
have
supposed
that
such
an
infernal
medley
of
passions
could
have
glared
out
of
any
human
eyes
i
almost
fainted
as
i
looked
i
knew
i
had
looked
into
the
eyes
of
a
lost
soul
austin
the
man's
outward
form
remained
but
all
hell
was
within
it
furious
lust
and
hate
that
was
like
fire
and
the
loss
of
all
hope
and
horror
that
seemed
to
shriek
aloud
to
the
night
though
his
teeth
were
shut
and
the
utter
blackness
of
despair
i
am
sure
that
he
did
not
see
me
he
saw
nothing
that
you
or
i
can
see
but
what
he
saw
i
hope
we
never
shall
i
do
not
know
when
he
died
i
suppose
in
an
hour
or
perhaps
two
but
when
i
passed
down
ashley
street
and
heard
the
closing
door
that
man
no
longer
belonged
to
this
world
it
was
a
devil's
face
i
looked
upon
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
in
the
room
when
villiers
ceased
speaking
the
light
was
failing
and
all
the
tumult
of
an
hour
ago
was
quite
hushed
austin
had
bent
his
head
at
the
close
of
the
story
and
his
hand
covered
his
eyes
what
can
it
mean
he
said
at
length
who
knows
austin
who
knows
it's
a
black
business
but
i
think
we
had
better
keep
it
to
ourselves
for
the
present
at
any
rate
i
will
see
if
i
cannot
learn
anything
about
that
house
through
private
channels
of
information
and
if
i
do
light
upon
anything
i
will
let
you
know
vii
the
encounter
in
soho
three
weeks
later
austin
received
a
note
from
villiers
asking
him
to
call
either
that
afternoon
or
the
next
he
chose
the
nearer
date
and
found
villiers
sitting
as
usual
by
the
window
apparently
lost
in
meditation
on
the
drowsy
traffic
of
the
street
there
was
a
bamboo
table
by
his
side
a
fantastic
thing
enriched
with
gilding
and
queer
painted
scenes
and
on
it
lay
a
little
pile
of
papers
arranged
and
docketed
as
neatly
as
anything
in
mr
clarke's
office
well
villiers
have
you
made
any
discoveries
in
the
last
three
weeks
i
think
so
i
have
here
one
or
two
memoranda
which
struck
me
as
singular
and
there
is
a
statement
to
which
i
shall
call
your
attention
and
these
documents
relate
to
mrs
beaumont
it
was
really
crashaw
whom
you
saw
that
night
standing
on
the
doorstep
of
the
house
in
ashley
street
as
to
that
matter
my
belief
remains
unchanged
but
neither
my
inquiries
nor
their
results
have
any
special
relation
to
crashaw
but
my
investigations
have
had
a
strange
issue
i
have
found
out
who
mrs
beaumont
is
who
is
she
in
what
way
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
you
and
i
know
her
better
under
another
name
what
name
is
that
herbert
herbert
austin
repeated
the
word
dazed
with
astonishment
yes
mrs
herbert
of
paul
street
helen
vaughan
of
earlier
adventures
unknown
to
me
you
had
reason
to
recognize
the
expression
of
her
face
when
you
go
home
look
at
the
face
in
meyrick's
book
of
horrors
and
you
will
know
the
sources
of
your
recollection
and
you
have
proof
of
this
yes
the
best
of
proof
i
have
seen
mrs
beaumont
or
shall
we
say
mrs
herbert
where
did
you
see
her
hardly
in
a
place
where
you
would
expect
to
see
a
lady
who
lives
in
ashley
street
piccadilly
i
saw
her
entering
a
house
in
one
of
the
meanest
and
most
disreputable
streets
in
soho
in
fact
i
had
made
an
appointment
though
not
with
her
and
she
was
precise
to
both
time
and
place
all
this
seems
very
wonderful
but
i
cannot
call
it
incredible
you
must
remember
villiers
that
i
have
seen
this
woman
in
the
ordinary
adventure
of
london
society
talking
and
laughing
and
sipping
her
coffee
in
a
commonplace
drawing-room
with
commonplace
people
but
you
know
what
you
are
saying
i
do
i
have
not
allowed
myself
to
be
led
by
surmises
or
fancies
it
was
with
no
thought
of
finding
helen
vaughan
that
i
searched
for
mrs
beaumont
in
the
dark
waters
of
the
life
of
london
but
such
has
been
the
issue
you
must
have
been
in
strange
places
villiers
yes
i
have
been
in
very
strange
places
it
would
have
been
useless
you
know
to
go
to
ashley
street
and
ask
mrs
beaumont
to
give
me
a
short
sketch
of
her
previous
history
no
assuming
as
i
had
to
assume
that
her
record
was
not
of
the
cleanest
it
would
be
pretty
certain
that
at
some
previous
time
she
must
have
moved
in
circles
not
quite
so
refined
as
her
present
ones
if
you
see
mud
at
the
top
of
a
stream
you
may
be
sure
that
it
was
once
at
the
bottom
i
went
to
the
bottom
i
have
always
been
fond
of
diving
into
queer
street
for
my
amusement
and
i
found
my
knowledge
of
that
locality
and
its
inhabitants
very
useful
it
is
perhaps
needless
to
say
that
my
friends
had
never
heard
the
name
of
beaumont
and
as
i
had
never
seen
the
lady
and
was
quite
unable
to
describe
her
i
had
to
set
to
work
in
an
indirect
way
the
people
there
know
me
i
have
been
able
to
do
some
of
them
a
service
now
and
again
so
they
made
no
difficulty
about
giving
their
information
they
were
aware
i
had
no
communication
direct
or
indirect
with
scotland
yard
i
had
to
cast
out
a
good
many
lines
though
before
i
got
what
i
wanted
and
when
i
landed
the
fish
i
did
not
for
a
moment
suppose
it
was
my
fish
but
i
listened
to
what
i
was
told
out
of
a
constitutional
liking
for
useless
information
and
i
found
myself
in
possession
of
a
very
curious
story
though
as
i
imagined
not
the
story
i
was
looking
for
it
was
to
this
effect
some
five
or
six
years
ago
a
woman
named
raymond
suddenly
made
her
appearance
in
the
neighbourhood
to
which
i
am
referring
she
was
described
to
me
as
being
quite
young
probably
not
more
than
seventeen
or
eighteen
very
handsome
and
looking
as
if
she
came
from
the
country
i
should
be
wrong
in
saying
that
she
found
her
level
in
going
to
this
particular
quarter
or
associating
with
these
people
for
from
what
i
was
told
i
should
think
the
worst
den
in
london
far
too
good
for
her
the
person
from
whom
i
got
my
information
as
you
may
suppose
no
great
puritan
shuddered
and
grew
sick
in
telling
me
of
the
nameless
infamies
which
were
laid
to
her
charge
after
living
there
for
a
year
or
perhaps
a
little
more
she
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
she
came
and
they
saw
nothing
of
her
till
about
the
time
of
the
paul
street
case
at
first
she
came
to
her
old
haunts
only
occasionally
then
more
frequently
and
finally
took
up
her
abode
there
as
before
and
remained
for
six
or
eight
months
it's
of
no
use
my
going
into
details
as
to
the
life
that
woman
led
if
you
want
particulars
you
can
look
at
meyrick's
legacy
those
designs
were
not
drawn
from
his
imagination
she
again
disappeared
and
the
people
of
the
place
saw
nothing
of
her
till
a
few
months
ago
my
informant
told
me
that
she
had
taken
some
rooms
in
a
house
which
he
pointed
out
and
these
rooms
she
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
two
or
three
times
a
week
and
always
at
ten
in
the
morning
i
was
led
to
expect
that
one
of
these
visits
would
be
paid
on
a
certain
day
about
a
week
ago
and
i
accordingly
managed
to
be
on
the
look-out
in
company
with
my
cicerone
at
a
quarter
to
ten
and
the
hour
and
the
lady
came
with
equal
punctuality
my
friend
and
i
were
standing
under
an
archway
a
little
way
back
from
the
street
but
she
saw
us
and
gave
me
a
glance
that
i
shall
be
long
in
forgetting
that
look
was
quite
enough
for
me
i
knew
miss
raymond
to
be
mrs
herbert
as
for
mrs
beaumont
she
had
quite
gone
out
of
my
head
she
went
into
the
house
and
i
watched
it
till
four
o'clock
when
she
came
out
and
then
i
followed
her
it
was
a
long
chase
and
i
had
to
be
very
careful
to
keep
a
long
way
in
the
background
and
yet
not
lose
sight
of
the
woman
she
took
me
down
to
the
strand
and
then
to
westminster
and
then
up
st
james's
street
and
along
piccadilly
i
felt
queerish
when
i
saw
her
turn
up
ashley
street
the
thought
that
mrs
herbert
was
mrs
beaumont
came
into
my
mind
but
it
seemed
too
impossible
to
be
true
i
waited
at
the
corner
keeping
my
eye
on
her
all
the
time
and
i
took
particular
care
to
note
the
house
at
which
she
stopped
it
was
the
house
with
the
gay
curtains
the
home
of
flowers
the
house
out
of
which
crashaw
came
the
night
he
hanged
himself
in
his
garden
i
was
just
going
away
with
my
discovery
when
i
saw
an
empty
carriage
come
round
and
draw
up
in
front
of
the
house
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
mrs
herbert
was
going
out
for
a
drive
and
i
was
right
there
as
it
happened
i
met
a
man
i
know
and
we
stood
talking
together
a
little
distance
from
the
carriage-way
to
which
i
had
my
back
we
had
not
been
there
for
ten
minutes
when
my
friend
took
off
his
hat
and
i
glanced
round
and
saw
the
lady
i
had
been
following
all
day
'who
is
that'
i
said
and
his
answer
was
'mrs
beaumont
lives
in
ashley
street'
of
course
there
could
be
no
doubt
after
that
i
don't
know
whether
she
saw
me
but
i
don't
think
she
did
i
went
home
at
once
and
on
consideration
i
thought
that
i
had
a
sufficiently
good
case
with
which
to
go
to
clarke
why
to
clarke
because
i
am
sure
that
clarke
is
in
possession
of
facts
about
this
woman
facts
of
which
i
know
nothing
well
what
then
mr
villiers
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
reflectively
at
austin
for
a
moment
before
he
answered
my
idea
was
that
clarke
and
i
should
call
on
mrs
beaumont
you
would
never
go
into
such
a
house
as
that
no
no
villiers
you
cannot
do
it
besides
consider
what
result
i
will
tell
you
soon
but
i
was
going
to
say
that
my
information
does
not
end
here
it
has
been
completed
in
an
extraordinary
manner
look
at
this
neat
little
packet
of
manuscript
it
is
paginated
you
see
and
i
have
indulged
in
the
civil
coquetry
of
a
ribbon
of
red
tape
it
has
almost
a
legal
air
hasn't
it
run
your
eye
over
it
austin
it
is
an
account
of
the
entertainment
mrs
beaumont
provided
for
her
choicer
guests
the
man
who
wrote
this
escaped
with
his
life
but
i
do
not
think
he
will
live
many
years
the
doctors
tell
him
he
must
have
sustained
some
severe
shock
to
the
nerves
austin
took
the
manuscript
but
never
read
it
opening
the
neat
pages
at
haphazard
his
eye
was
caught
by
a
word
and
a
phrase
that
followed
it
and
sick
at
heart
with
white
lips
and
a
cold
sweat
pouring
like
water
from
his
temples
he
flung
the
paper
down
take
it
away
villiers
never
speak
of
this
again
are
you
made
of
stone
man
why
the
dread
and
horror
of
death
itself
the
thoughts
of
the
man
who
stands
in
the
keen
morning
air
on
the
black
platform
bound
the
bell
tolling
in
his
ears
and
waits
for
the
harsh
rattle
of
the
bolt
are
as
nothing
compared
to
this
i
will
not
read
it
i
should
never
sleep
again
very
good
i
can
fancy
what
you
saw
yes
it
is
horrible
enough
but
after
all
it
is
an
old
story
an
old
mystery
played
in
our
day
and
in
dim
london
streets
instead
of
amidst
the
vineyards
and
the
olive
gardens
we
know
what
happened
to
those
who
chanced
to
meet
the
great
god
pan
and
those
who
are
wise
know
that
all
symbols
are
symbols
of
something
not
of
nothing
it
was
indeed
an
exquisite
symbol
beneath
which
men
long
ago
veiled
their
knowledge
of
the
most
awful
most
secret
forces
which
lie
at
the
heart
of
all
things
forces
before
which
the
souls
of
men
must
wither
and
die
and
blacken
as
their
bodies
blacken
under
the
electric
current
such
forces
cannot
be
named
cannot
be
spoken
cannot
be
imagined
except
under
a
veil
and
a
symbol
a
symbol
to
the
most
of
us
appearing
a
quaint
poetic
fancy
to
some
a
foolish
tale
but
you
and
i
at
all
events
have
known
something
of
the
terror
that
may
dwell
in
the
secret
place
of
life
manifested
under
human
flesh
that
which
is
without
form
taking
to
itself
a
form
oh
austin
how
can
it
be
how
is
it
that
the
very
sunlight
does
not
turn
to
blackness
before
this
thing
the
hard
earth
melt
and
boil
beneath
such
a
burden
villiers
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
and
the
beads
of
sweat
stood
out
on
his
forehead
austin
sat
silent
for
a
while
but
villiers
saw
him
make
a
sign
upon
his
breast
i
say
again
villiers
you
will
surely
never
enter
such
a
house
as
that
you
would
never
pass
out
alive
yes
austin
i
shall
go
out
alive--i
and
clarke
with
me
what
do
you
mean
you
cannot
you
would
not
dare
wait
a
moment
the
air
was
very
pleasant
and
fresh
this
morning
there
was
a
breeze
blowing
even
through
this
dull
street
and
i
thought
i
would
take
a
walk
piccadilly
stretched
before
me
a
clear
bright
vista
and
the
sun
flashed
on
the
carriages
and
on
the
quivering
leaves
in
the
park
it
was
a
joyous
morning
and
men
and
women
looked
at
the
sky
and
smiled
as
they
went
about
their
work
or
their
pleasure
and
the
wind
blew
as
blithely
as
upon
the
meadows
and
the
scented
gorse
but
somehow
or
other
i
got
out
of
the
bustle
and
the
gaiety
and
found
myself
walking
slowly
along
a
quiet
dull
street
where
there
seemed
to
be
no
sunshine
and
no
air
and
where
the
few
foot-passengers
loitered
as
they
walked
and
hung
indecisively
about
corners
and
archways
i
walked
along
hardly
knowing
where
i
was
going
or
what
i
did
there
but
feeling
impelled
as
one
sometimes
is
to
explore
still
further
with
a
vague
idea
of
reaching
some
unknown
goal
thus
i
forged
up
the
street
noting
the
small
traffic
of
the
milk-shop
and
wondering
at
the
incongruous
medley
of
penny
pipes
black
tobacco
sweets
newspapers
and
comic
songs
which
here
and
there
jostled
one
another
in
the
short
compass
of
a
single
window
i
think
it
was
a
cold
shudder
that
suddenly
passed
through
me
that
first
told
me
that
i
had
found
what
i
wanted
i
looked
up
from
the
pavement
and
stopped
before
a
dusty
shop
above
which
the
lettering
had
faded
where
the
red
bricks
of
two
hundred
years
ago
had
grimed
to
black
where
the
windows
had
gathered
to
themselves
the
dust
of
winters
innumerable
i
saw
what
i
required
but
i
think
it
was
five
minutes
before
i
had
steadied
myself
and
could
walk
in
and
ask
for
it
in
a
cool
voice
and
with
a
calm
face
i
think
there
must
even
then
have
been
a
tremor
in
my
words
for
the
old
man
who
came
out
of
the
back
parlour
and
fumbled
slowly
amongst
his
goods
looked
oddly
at
me
as
he
tied
the
parcel
i
paid
what
he
asked
and
stood
leaning
by
the
counter
with
a
strange
reluctance
to
take
up
my
goods
and
go
i
asked
about
the
business
and
learnt
that
trade
was
bad
and
the
profits
cut
down
sadly
but
then
the
street
was
not
what
it
was
before
traffic
had
been
diverted
but
that
was
done
forty
years
ago
'just
before
my
father
died'
he
said
i
got
away
at
last
and
walked
along
sharply
it
was
a
dismal
street
indeed
and
i
was
glad
to
return
to
the
bustle
and
the
noise
would
you
like
to
see
my
purchase
austin
said
nothing
but
nodded
his
head
slightly
he
still
looked
white
and
sick
villiers
pulled
out
a
drawer
in
the
bamboo
table
and
showed
austin
a
long
coil
of
cord
hard
and
new
and
at
one
end
was
a
running
noose
it
is
the
best
hempen
cord
said
villiers
just
as
it
used
to
be
made
for
the
old
trade
the
man
told
me
not
an
inch
of
jute
from
end
to
end
austin
set
his
teeth
hard
and
stared
at
villiers
growing
whiter
as
he
looked
you
would
not
do
it
he
murmured
at
last
you
would
not
have
blood
on
your
hands
my
god
he
exclaimed
with
sudden
vehemence
you
cannot
mean
this
villiers
that
you
will
make
yourself
a
hangman
no
i
shall
offer
a
choice
and
leave
helen
vaughan
alone
with
this
cord
in
a
locked
room
for
fifteen
minutes
if
when
we
go
in
it
is
not
done
i
shall
call
the
nearest
policeman
that
is
all
i
must
go
now
i
cannot
stay
here
any
longer
i
cannot
bear
this
good-night
good-night
austin
the
door
shut
but
in
a
moment
it
was
open
again
and
austin
stood
white
and
ghastly
in
the
entrance
i
was
forgetting
he
said
that
i
too
have
something
to
tell
i
have
received
a
letter
from
dr
harding
of
buenos
ayres
he
says
that
he
attended
meyrick
for
three
weeks
before
his
death
and
does
he
say
what
carried
him
off
in
the
prime
of
life
it
was
not
fever
no
it
was
not
fever
according
to
the
doctor
it
was
an
utter
collapse
of
the
whole
system
probably
caused
by
some
severe
shock
but
he
states
that
the
patient
would
tell
him
nothing
and
that
he
was
consequently
at
some
disadvantage
in
treating
the
case
is
there
anything
more
yes
dr
harding
ends
his
letter
by
saying
'i
think
this
is
all
the
information
i
can
give
you
about
your
poor
friend
he
had
not
been
long
in
buenos
ayres
and
knew
scarcely
any
one
with
the
exception
of
a
person
who
did
not
bear
the
best
of
characters
and
has
since
left--a
mrs
vaughan'
viii
the
fragments
amongst
the
papers
of
the
well-known
physician
dr
robert
matheson
of
ashley
street
piccadilly
who
died
suddenly
of
apoplectic
seizure
at
the
beginning
of
1892
a
leaf
of
manuscript
paper
was
found
covered
with
pencil
jottings
these
notes
were
in
latin
much
abbreviated
and
had
evidently
been
made
in
great
haste
the
ms
was
only
deciphered
with
difficulty
and
some
words
have
up
to
the
present
time
evaded
all
the
efforts
of
the
expert
employed
the
date
xxv
jul
1888
is
written
on
the
right-hand
corner
of
the
ms
the
following
is
a
translation
of
dr
matheson's
manuscript
whether
science
would
benefit
by
these
brief
notes
if
they
could
be
published
i
do
not
know
but
rather
doubt
but
certainly
i
shall
never
take
the
responsibility
of
publishing
or
divulging
one
word
of
what
is
here
written
not
only
on
account
of
my
oath
given
freely
to
those
two
persons
who
were
present
but
also
because
the
details
are
too
abominable
it
is
probably
that
upon
mature
consideration
and
after
weighting
the
good
and
evil
i
shall
one
day
destroy
this
paper
or
at
least
leave
it
under
seal
to
my
friend
d
trusting
in
his
discretion
to
use
it
or
to
burn
it
as
he
may
think
fit
as
was
befitting
i
did
all
that
my
knowledge
suggested
to
make
sure
that
i
was
suffering
under
no
delusion
at
first
astounded
i
could
hardly
think
but
in
a
minute's
time
i
was
sure
that
my
pulse
was
steady
and
regular
and
that
i
was
in
my
real
and
true
senses
i
then
fixed
my
eyes
quietly
on
what
was
before
me
though
horror
and
revolting
nausea
rose
up
within
me
and
an
odour
of
corruption
choked
my
breath
i
remained
firm
i
was
then
privileged
or
accursed
i
dare
not
say
which
to
see
that
which
was
on
the
bed
lying
there
black
like
ink
transformed
before
my
eyes
the
skin
and
the
flesh
and
the
muscles
and
the
bones
and
the
firm
structure
of
the
human
body
that
i
had
thought
to
be
unchangeable
and
permanent
as
adamant
began
to
melt
and
dissolve
i
know
that
the
body
may
be
separated
into
its
elements
by
external
agencies
but
i
should
have
refused
to
believe
what
i
saw
for
here
there
was
some
internal
force
of
which
i
knew
nothing
that
caused
dissolution
and
change
here
too
was
all
the
work
by
which
man
had
been
made
repeated
before
my
eyes
i
saw
the
form
waver
from
sex
to
sex
dividing
itself
from
itself
and
then
again
reunited
then
i
saw
the
body
descend
to
the
beasts
whence
it
ascended
and
that
which
was
on
the
heights
go
down
to
the
depths
even
to
the
abyss
of
all
being
the
principle
of
life
which
makes
organism
always
remained
while
the
outward
form
changed
the
light
within
the
room
had
turned
to
blackness
not
the
darkness
of
night
in
which
objects
are
seen
dimly
for
i
could
see
clearly
and
without
difficulty
but
it
was
the
negation
of
light
objects
were
presented
to
my
eyes
if
i
may
say
so
without
any
medium
in
such
a
manner
that
if
there
had
been
a
prism
in
the
room
i
should
have
seen
no
colours
represented
in
it
i
watched
and
at
last
i
saw
nothing
but
a
substance
as
jelly
then
the
ladder
was
ascended
again
here
the
ms
is
illegible
for
one
instance
i
saw
a
form
shaped
in
dimness
before
me
which
i
will
not
farther
describe
but
the
symbol
of
this
form
may
be
seen
in
ancient
sculptures
and
in
paintings
which
survived
beneath
the
lava
too
foul
to
be
spoken
of
as
a
horrible
and
unspeakable
shape
neither
man
nor
beast
was
changed
into
human
form
there
came
finally
death
i
who
saw
all
this
not
without
great
horror
and
loathing
of
soul
here
write
my
name
declaring
all
that
i
have
set
on
this
paper
to
be
true
robert
matheson
med
dr





such
raymond
is
the
story
of
what
i
know
and
what
i
have
seen
the
burden
of
it
was
too
heavy
for
me
to
bear
alone
and
yet
i
could
tell
it
to
none
but
you
villiers
who
was
with
me
at
the
last
knows
nothing
of
that
awful
secret
of
the
wood
of
how
what
we
both
saw
die
lay
upon
the
smooth
sweet
turf
amidst
the
summer
flowers
half
in
sun
and
half
in
shadow
and
holding
the
girl
rachel's
hand
called
and
summoned
those
companions
and
shaped
in
solid
form
upon
the
earth
we
tread
upon
the
horror
which
we
can
but
hint
at
which
we
can
only
name
under
a
figure
i
would
not
tell
villiers
of
this
nor
of
that
resemblance
which
struck
me
as
with
a
blow
upon
my
heart
when
i
saw
the
portrait
which
filled
the
cup
of
terror
at
the
end
what
this
can
mean
i
dare
not
guess
i
know
that
what
i
saw
perish
was
not
mary
and
yet
in
the
last
agony
mary's
eyes
looked
into
mine
whether
there
can
be
any
one
who
can
show
the
last
link
in
this
chain
of
awful
mystery
i
do
not
know
but
if
there
be
any
one
who
can
do
this
you
raymond
are
the
man
and
if
you
know
the
secret
it
rests
with
you
to
tell
it
or
not
as
you
please
i
am
writing
this
letter
to
you
immediately
on
my
getting
back
to
town
i
have
been
in
the
country
for
the
last
few
days
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
guess
in
which
part
while
the
horror
and
wonder
of
london
was
at
its
height--for
mrs
beaumont
as
i
have
told
you
was
well
known
in
society--i
wrote
to
my
friend
dr
phillips
giving
some
brief
outline
or
rather
hint
of
what
happened
and
asking
him
to
tell
me
the
name
of
the
village
where
the
events
he
had
related
to
me
occurred
he
gave
me
the
name
as
he
said
with
the
less
hesitation
because
rachel's
father
and
mother
were
dead
and
the
rest
of
the
family
had
gone
to
a
relative
in
the
state
of
washington
six
months
before
the
parents
he
said
had
undoubtedly
died
of
grief
and
horror
caused
by
the
terrible
death
of
their
daughter
and
by
what
had
gone
before
that
death
on
the
evening
of
the
day
which
i
received
phillips'
letter
i
was
at
caermaen
and
standing
beneath
the
mouldering
roman
walls
white
with
the
winters
of
seventeen
hundred
years
i
looked
over
the
meadow
where
once
had
stood
the
older
temple
of
the
god
of
the
deeps
and
saw
a
house
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
it
was
the
house
where
helen
had
lived
i
stayed
at
caermaen
for
several
days
the
people
of
the
place
i
found
knew
little
and
had
guessed
less
those
whom
i
spoke
to
on
the
matter
seemed
surprised
that
an
antiquarian
as
i
professed
myself
to
be
should
trouble
about
a
village
tragedy
of
which
they
gave
a
very
commonplace
version
and
as
you
may
imagine
i
told
nothing
of
what
i
knew
most
of
my
time
was
spent
in
the
great
wood
that
rises
just
above
the
village
and
climbs
the
hillside
and
goes
down
to
the
river
in
the
valley
such
another
long
lovely
valley
raymond
as
that
on
which
we
looked
one
summer
night
walking
to
and
fro
before
your
house
for
many
an
hour
i
strayed
through
the
maze
of
the
forest
turning
now
to
right
and
now
to
left
pacing
slowly
down
long
alleys
of
undergrowth
shadowy
and
chill
even
under
the
midday
sun
and
halting
beneath
great
oaks
lying
on
the
short
turf
of
a
clearing
where
the
faint
sweet
scent
of
wild
roses
came
to
me
on
the
wind
and
mixed
with
the
heavy
perfume
of
the
elder
whose
mingled
odour
is
like
the
odour
of
the
room
of
the
dead
a
vapour
of
incense
and
corruption
i
stood
at
the
edges
of
the
wood
gazing
at
all
the
pomp
and
procession
of
the
foxgloves
towering
amidst
the
bracken
and
shining
red
in
the
broad
sunshine
and
beyond
them
into
deep
thickets
of
close
undergrowth
where
springs
boil
up
from
the
rock
and
nourish
the
water-weeds
dank
and
evil
but
in
all
my
wanderings
i
avoided
one
part
of
the
wood
it
was
not
till
yesterday
that
i
climbed
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
and
stood
upon
the
ancient
roman
road
that
threads
the
highest
ridge
of
the
wood
here
they
had
walked
helen
and
rachel
along
this
quiet
causeway
upon
the
pavement
of
green
turf
shut
in
on
either
side
by
high
banks
of
red
earth
and
tall
hedges
of
shining
beech
and
here
i
followed
in
their
steps
looking
out
now
and
again
through
partings
in
the
boughs
and
seeing
on
one
side
the
sweep
of
the
wood
stretching
far
to
right
and
left
and
sinking
into
the
broad
level
and
beyond
the
yellow
sea
and
the
land
over
the
sea
on
the
other
side
was
the
valley
and
the
river
and
hill
following
hill
as
wave
on
wave
and
wood
and
meadow
and
cornfield
and
white
houses
gleaming
and
a
great
wall
of
mountain
and
far
blue
peaks
in
the
north
and
so
at
last
i
came
to
the
place
the
track
went
up
a
gentle
slope
and
widened
out
into
an
open
space
with
a
wall
of
thick
undergrowth
around
it
and
then
narrowing
again
passed
on
into
the
distance
and
the
faint
blue
mist
of
summer
heat
and
into
this
pleasant
summer
glade
rachel
passed
a
girl
and
left
it
who
shall
say
what
i
did
not
stay
long
there
in
a
small
town
near
caermaen
there
is
a
museum
containing
for
the
most
part
roman
remains
which
have
been
found
in
the
neighbourhood
at
various
times
on
the
day
after
my
arrival
in
caermaen
i
walked
over
to
the
town
in
question
and
took
the
opportunity
of
inspecting
the
museum
after
i
had
seen
most
of
the
sculptured
stones
the
coffins
rings
coins
and
fragments
of
tessellated
pavement
which
the
place
contains
i
was
shown
a
small
square
pillar
of
white
stone
which
had
been
recently
discovered
in
the
wood
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
and
as
i
found
on
inquiry
in
that
open
space
where
the
roman
road
broadens
out
on
one
side
of
the
pillar
was
an
inscription
of
which
i
took
a
note
some
of
the
letters
have
been
defaced
but
i
do
not
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
as
to
those
which
i
supply
the
inscription
is
as
follows
devomnodent--i--
fla--v--ivssenilispossv--it--
propternvp--tias--
--qua--sviditsvbvmb--ra--
to
the
great
god
nodens
the
god
of
the
great
deep
or
abyss
flavius
senilis
has
erected
this
pillar
on
account
of
the
marriage
which
he
saw
beneath
the
shade
the
custodian
of
the
museum
informed
me
that
local
antiquaries
were
much
puzzled
not
by
the
inscription
or
by
any
difficulty
in
translating
it
but
as
to
the
circumstance
or
rite
to
which
allusion
is
made





and
now
my
dear
clarke
as
to
what
you
tell
me
about
helen
vaughan
whom
you
say
you
saw
die
under
circumstances
of
the
utmost
and
almost
incredible
horror
i
was
interested
in
your
account
but
a
good
deal
nay
all
of
what
you
told
me
i
knew
already
i
can
understand
the
strange
likeness
you
remarked
in
both
the
portrait
and
in
the
actual
face
you
have
seen
helen's
mother
you
remember
that
still
summer
night
so
many
years
ago
when
i
talked
to
you
of
the
world
beyond
the
shadows
and
of
the
god
pan
you
remember
mary
she
was
the
mother
of
helen
vaughan
who
was
born
nine
months
after
that
night
mary
never
recovered
her
reason
she
lay
as
you
saw
her
all
the
while
upon
her
bed
and
a
few
days
after
the
child
was
born
she
died
i
fancy
that
just
at
the
last
she
knew
me
i
was
standing
by
the
bed
and
the
old
look
came
into
her
eyes
for
a
second
and
then
she
shuddered
and
groaned
and
died
it
was
an
ill
work
i
did
that
night
when
you
were
present
i
broke
open
the
door
of
the
house
of
life
without
knowing
or
caring
what
might
pass
forth
or
enter
in
i
recollect
your
telling
me
at
the
time
sharply
enough
and
rightly
too
in
one
sense
that
i
had
ruined
the
reason
of
a
human
being
by
a
foolish
experiment
based
on
an
absurd
theory
you
did
well
to
blame
me
but
my
theory
was
not
all
absurdity
what
i
said
mary
would
see
she
saw
but
i
forgot
that
no
human
eyes
can
look
on
such
a
sight
with
impunity
and
i
forgot
as
i
have
just
said
that
when
the
house
of
life
is
thus
thrown
open
there
may
enter
in
that
for
which
we
have
no
name
and
human
flesh
may
become
the
veil
of
a
horror
one
dare
not
express
i
played
with
energies
which
i
did
not
understand
you
have
seen
the
ending
of
it
helen
vaughan
did
well
to
bind
the
cord
about
her
neck
and
die
though
the
death
was
horrible
the
blackened
face
the
hideous
form
upon
the
bed
changing
and
melting
before
your
eyes
from
woman
to
man
from
man
to
beast
and
from
beast
to
worse
than
beast
all
the
strange
horror
that
you
witness
surprises
me
but
little
what
you
say
the
doctor
whom
you
sent
for
saw
and
shuddered
at
i
noticed
long
ago
i
knew
what
i
had
done
the
moment
the
child
was
born
and
when
it
was
scarcely
five
years
old
i
surprised
it
not
once
or
twice
but
several
times
with
a
playmate
you
may
guess
of
what
kind
it
was
for
me
a
constant
an
incarnate
horror
and
after
a
few
years
i
felt
i
could
bear
it
no
more
and
i
sent
helen
vaughan
away
you
know
now
what
frightened
the
boy
in
the
wood
the
rest
of
the
strange
story
and
all
else
that
you
tell
me
as
discovered
by
your
friend
i
have
contrived
to
learn
from
time
to
time
almost
to
the
last
chapter
and
now
helen
is
with
her
companions
