two
of
these
stories
the
third
and
fourth
have
appeared
in
print
in
the
cambridge
review
and
i
wish
to
thank
the
proprietor
for
permitting
me
to
republish
them
here
i
have
had
my
doubts
about
the
wisdom
of
publishing
a
third
set
of
tales
sequels
are
not
only
proverbially
but
actually
very
hazardous
things
however
the
tales
make
no
pretence
but
to
amuse
and
my
friends
have
not
seldom
asked
for
the
publication
so
not
a
great
deal
is
risked
perhaps
and
perhaps
also
some
one's
christmas
may
be
the
cheerfuller
for
a
storybook
which
i
think
only
once
mentions

residence
at

dr
ashton--thomas
ashton
doctor
of
divinity--sat
in
his
study
habited
in
a
dressing-gown
and
with
a
silk
cap
on
his
shaven
head--his
wig
being
for
the
time
taken
off
and
placed
on
its
block
on
a
side
table
he
was
a
man
of
some
fifty-five
years
strongly
made
of
a
sanguine
complexion
an
angry
eye
and
a
long
upper
lip
face
and
eye
were
lighted
up
at
the
moment
when
i
picture
him
by
the
level
ray
of
an
afternoon
sun
that
shone
in
upon
him
through
a
tall
sash
window
giving
on
the
west
the
room
into
which
it
shone
was
also
tall
lined
with
book-cases
and
where
the
wall
showed
between
them
panelled
on
the
table
near
the
doctor's
elbow
was
a
green
cloth
and
upon
it
what
he
would
have
called
a
silver
standish--a
tray
with
inkstands--quill
pens
a
calf-bound
book
or
two
some
papers
a
churchwarden
pipe
and
brass
tobacco-box
a
flask
cased
in
plaited
straw
and
a
liqueur
glass
the
year
was
1730
the
month
december
the
hour
somewhat
past
three
in
the
afternoon
i
have
described
in
these
lines
pretty
much
all
that
a
superficial
observer
would
have
noted
when
he
looked
into
the
room
what
met
dr
ashton's
eye
when
he
looked
out
of
it
sitting
in
his
leather
arm-chair
little
more
than
the
tops
of
the
shrubs
and
fruit-trees
of
his
garden
could
be
seen
from
that
point
but
the
red
brick
wall
of
it
was
visible
in
almost
all
the
length
of
its
western
side
in
the
middle
of
that
was
a
gate--a
double
gate
of
rather
elaborate
iron
scroll-work
which
allowed
something
of
a
view
beyond
through
it
he
could
see
that
the
ground
sloped
away
almost
at
once
to
a
bottom
along
which
a
stream
must
run
and
rose
steeply
from
it
on
the
other
side
up
to
a
field
that
was
park-like
in
character
and
thickly
studded
with
oaks
now
of
course
leafless
they
did
not
stand
so
thick
together
but
that
some
glimpse
of
sky
and
horizon
could
be
seen
between
their
stems
the
sky
was
now
golden
and
the
horizon
a
horizon
of
distant
woods
it
seemed
was
purple
but
all
that
dr
ashton
could
find
to
say
after
contemplating
this
prospect
for
many
minutes
was
abominable
a
listener
would
have
been
aware
immediately
upon
this
of
the
sound
of
footsteps
coming
somewhat
hurriedly
in
the
direction
of
the
study
by
the
resonance
he
could
have
told
that
they
were
traversing
a
much
larger
room
dr
ashton
turned
round
in
his
chair
as
the
door
opened
and
looked
expectant
the
incomer
was
a
lady--a
stout
lady
in
the
dress
of
the
time
though
i
have
made
some
attempt
at
indicating
the
doctor's
costume
i
will
not
enterprise
that
of
his
wife--for
it
was
mrs
ashton
who
now
entered
she
had
an
anxious
even
a
sorely
distracted
look
and
it
was
in
a
very
disturbed
voice
that
she
almost
whispered
to
dr
ashton
putting
her
head
close
to
his
he's
in
a
very
sad
way
love
worse
i'm
afraid
tt--tt
is
he
really
and
he
leaned
back
and
looked
in
her
face
she
nodded
two
solemn
bells
high
up
and
not
far
away
rang
out
the
half-hour
at
this
moment
mrs
ashton
started
oh
do
you
think
you
can
give
order
that
the
minster
clock
be
stopped
chiming
to-night
'tis
just
over
his
chamber
and
will
keep
him
from
sleeping
and
to
sleep
is
the
only
chance
for
him
that's
certain
why
to
be
sure
if
there
were
need
real
need
it
could
be
done
but
not
upon
any
light
occasion
this
frank
now
do
you
assure
me
that
his
recovery
stands
upon
it
said
dr
ashton
his
voice
was
loud
and
rather
hard
i
do
verily
believe
it
said
his
wife
then
if
it
must
be
bid
molly
run
across
to
simpkins
and
say
on
my
authority
that
he
is
to
stop
the
clock
chimes
at
sunset
and--yes--she
is
after
that
to
say
to
my
lord
saul
that
i
wish
to
see
him
presently
in
this
room
mrs
ashton
hurried
off
before
any
other
visitor
enters
it
will
be
well
to
explain
the
situation
dr
ashton
was
the
holder
among
other
preferments
of
a
prebend
in
the
rich
collegiate
church
of
whitminster
one
of
the
foundations
which
though
not
a
cathedral
survived
dissolution
and
reformation
and
retained
its
constitution
and
endowments
for
a
hundred
years
after
the
time
of
which
i
write
the
great
church
the
residences
of
the
dean
and
the
two
prebendaries
the
choir
and
its
appurtenances
were
all
intact
and
in
working
order
a
dean
who
flourished
soon
after
1500
had
been
a
great
builder
and
had
erected
a
spacious
quadrangle
of
red
brick
adjoining
the
church
for
the
residence
of
the
officials
some
of
these
persons
were
no
longer
required
their
offices
had
dwindled
down
to
mere
titles
borne
by
clergy
or
lawyers
in
the
town
and
neighbourhood
and
so
the
houses
that
had
been
meant
to
accommodate
eight
or
ten
people
were
now
shared
among
three
the
dean
and
the
two
prebendaries
dr
ashton's
included
what
had
been
the
common
parlour
and
the
dining-hall
of
the
whole
body
it
occupied
a
whole
side
of
the
court
and
at
one
end
had
a
private
door
into
the
minster
the
other
end
as
we
have
seen
looked
out
over
the
country
so
much
for
the
house
as
for
the
inmates
dr
ashton
was
a
wealthy
man
and
childless
and
he
had
adopted
or
rather
undertaken
to
bring
up
the
orphan
son
of
his
wife's
sister
frank
sydall
was
the
lad's
name
he
had
been
a
good
many
months
in
the
house
then
one
day
came
a
letter
from
an
irish
peer
the
earl
of
kildonan
who
had
known
dr
ashton
at
college
putting
it
to
the
doctor
whether
he
would
consider
taking
into
his
family
the
viscount
saul
the
earl's
heir
and
acting
in
some
sort
as
his
tutor
lord
kildonan
was
shortly
to
take
up
a
post
in
the
lisbon
embassy
and
the
boy
was
unfit
to
make
the
voyage
not
that
he
is
sickly
the
earl
wrote
though
you'll
find
him
whimsical
or
of
late
i've
thought
him
so
and
to
confirm
this
'twas
only
to-day
his
old
nurse
came
expressly
to
tell
me
he
was
possess'd
but
let
that
pass
i'll
warrant
you
can
find
a
spell
to
make
all
straight
your
arm
was
stout
enough
in
old
days
and
i
give
you
plenary
authority
to
use
it
as
you
see
fit
the
truth
is
he
has
here
no
boys
of
his
age
or
quality
to
consort
with
and
is
given
to
moping
about
in
our
raths
and
graveyards
and
he
brings
home
romances
that
fright
my
servants
out
of
their
wits
so
there
are
you
and
your
lady
forewarned
it
was
perhaps
with
half
an
eye
open
to
the
possibility
of
an
irish
bishopric
at
which
another
sentence
in
the
earl's
letter
seemed
to
hint
that
dr
ashton
accepted
the
charge
of
my
lord
viscount
saul
and
of
the
200
guineas
a
year
that
were
to
come
with
him
so
he
came
one
night
in
september
when
he
got
out
of
the
chaise
that
brought
him
he
went
first
and
spoke
to
the
postboy
and
gave
him
some
money
and
patted
the
neck
of
his
horse
whether
he
made
some
movement
that
scared
it
or
not
there
was
very
nearly
a
nasty
accident
for
the
beast
started
violently
and
the
postilion
being
unready
was
thrown
and
lost
his
fee
as
he
found
afterwards
and
the
chaise
lost
some
paint
on
the
gateposts
and
the
wheel
went
over
the
man's
foot
who
was
taking
out
the
baggage
when
lord
saul
came
up
the
steps
into
the
light
of
the
lamp
in
the
porch
to
be
greeted
by
dr
ashton
he
was
seen
to
be
a
thin
youth
of
say
sixteen
years
old
with
straight
black
hair
and
the
pale
colouring
that
is
common
to
such
a
figure
he
took
the
accident
and
commotion
calmly
enough
and
expressed
a
proper
anxiety
for
the
people
who
had
been
or
might
have
been
hurt
his
voice
was
smooth
and
pleasant
and
without
any
trace
curiously
of
an
irish
brogue
frank
sydall
was
a
younger
boy
perhaps
of
eleven
or
twelve
but
lord
saul
did
not
for
that
reject
his
company
frank
was
able
to
teach
him
various
games
he
had
not
known
in
ireland
and
he
was
apt
at
learning
them
apt
too
at
his
books
though
he
had
had
little
or
no
regular
teaching
at
home
it
was
not
long
before
he
was
making
a
shift
to
puzzle
out
the
inscriptions
on
the
tombs
in
the
minster
and
he
would
often
put
a
question
to
the
doctor
about
the
old
books
in
the
library
that
required
some
thought
to
answer
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
he
made
himself
very
agreeable
to
the
servants
for
within
ten
days
of
his
coming
they
were
almost
falling
over
each
other
in
their
efforts
to
oblige
him
at
the
same
time
mrs
ashton
was
rather
put
to
it
to
find
new
maidservants
for
there
were
several
changes
and
some
of
the
families
in
the
town
from
which
she
had
been
accustomed
to
draw
seemed
to
have
no
one
available
she
was
forced
to
go
further
afield
than
was
usual
these
generalities
i
gather
from
the
doctor's
notes
in
his
diary
and
from
letters
they
are
generalities
and
we
should
like
in
view
of
what
has
to
be
told
something
sharper
and
more
detailed
we
get
it
in
entries
which
begin
late
in
the
year
and
i
think
were
posted
up
all
together
after
the
final
incident
but
they
cover
so
few
days
in
all
that
there
is
no
need
to
doubt
that
the
writer
could
remember
the
course
of
things
accurately
on
a
friday
morning
it
was
that
a
fox
or
perhaps
a
cat
made
away
with
mrs
ashton's
most
prized
black
cockerel
a
bird
without
a
single
white
feather
on
its
body
her
husband
had
told
her
often
enough
that
it
would
make
a
suitable
sacrifice
to
ã†sculapius
that
had
discomfited
her
much
and
now
she
would
hardly
be
consoled
the
boys
looked
everywhere
for
traces
of
it
lord
saul
brought
in
a
few
feathers
which
seemed
to
have
been
partially
burnt
on
the
garden
rubbish-heap
it
was
on
the
same
day
that
dr
ashton
looking
out
of
an
upper
window
saw
the
two
boys
playing
in
the
corner
of
the
garden
at
a
game
he
did
not
understand
frank
was
looking
earnestly
at
something
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
saul
stood
behind
him
and
seemed
to
be
listening
after
some
minutes
he
very
gently
laid
his
hand
on
frank's
head
and
almost
instantly
thereupon
frank
suddenly
dropped
whatever
it
was
that
he
was
holding
clapped
his
hands
to
his
eyes
and
sank
down
on
the
grass
saul
whose
face
expressed
great
anger
hastily
picked
the
object
up
of
which
it
could
only
be
seen
that
it
was
glittering
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
turned
away
leaving
frank
huddled
up
on
the
grass
dr
ashton
rapped
on
the
window
to
attract
their
attention
and
saul
looked
up
as
if
in
alarm
and
then
springing
to
frank
pulled
him
up
by
the
arm
and
led
him
away
when
they
came
in
to
dinner
saul
explained
that
they
had
been
acting
a
part
of
the
tragedy
of
radamistus
in
which
the
heroine
reads
the
future
fate
of
her
father's
kingdom
by
means
of
a
glass
ball
held
in
her
hand
and
is
overcome
by
the
terrible
events
she
has
seen
during
this
explanation
frank
said
nothing
only
looked
rather
bewilderedly
at
saul
he
must
mrs
ashton
thought
have
contracted
a
chill
from
the
wet
of
the
grass
for
that
evening
he
was
certainly
feverish
and
disordered
and
the
disorder
was
of
the
mind
as
well
as
the
body
for
he
seemed
to
have
something
he
wished
to
say
to
mrs
ashton
only
a
press
of
household
affairs
prevented
her
from
paying
attention
to
him
and
when
she
went
according
to
her
habit
to
see
that
the
light
in
the
boys'
chamber
had
been
taken
away
and
to
bid
them
good-night
he
seemed
to
be
sleeping
though
his
face
was
unnaturally
flushed
to
her
thinking
lord
saul
however
was
pale
and
quiet
and
smiling
in
his
slumber
next
morning
it
happened
that
dr
ashton
was
occupied
in
church
and
other
business
and
unable
to
take
the
boys'
lessons
he
therefore
set
them
tasks
to
be
written
and
brought
to
him
three
times
if
not
oftener
frank
knocked
at
the
study
door
and
each
time
the
doctor
chanced
to
be
engaged
with
some
visitor
and
sent
the
boy
off
rather
roughly
which
he
later
regretted
two
clergymen
were
at
dinner
this
day
and
both
remarked--being
fathers
of
families--that
the
lad
seemed
sickening
for
a
fever
in
which
they
were
too
near
the
truth
and
it
had
been
better
if
he
had
been
put
to
bed
forthwith
for
a
couple
of
hours
later
in
the
afternoon
he
came
running
into
the
house
crying
out
in
a
way
that
was
really
terrifying
and
rushing
to
mrs
ashton
clung
about
her
begging
her
to
protect
him
and
saying
keep
them
off
keep
them
off
without
intermission
and
it
was
now
evident
that
some
sickness
had
taken
strong
hold
of
him
he
was
therefore
got
to
bed
in
another
chamber
from
that
in
which
he
commonly
lay
and
the
physician
brought
to
him
who
pronounced
the
disorder
to
be
grave
and
affecting
the
lad's
brain
and
prognosticated
a
fatal
end
to
it
if
strict
quiet
were
not
observed
and
those
sedative
remedies
used
which
he
should
prescribe
we
are
now
come
by
another
way
to
the
point
we
had
reached
before
the
minster
clock
has
been
stopped
from
striking
and
lord
saul
is
on
the
threshold
of
the
study
what
account
can
you
give
of
this
poor
lad's
state
was
dr
ashton's
first
question
why
sir
little
more
than
you
know
already
i
fancy
i
must
blame
myself
though
for
giving
him
a
fright
yesterday
when
we
were
acting
that
foolish
play
you
saw
i
fear
i
made
him
take
it
more
to
heart
than
i
meant
how
so
well
by
telling
him
foolish
tales
i
had
picked
up
in
ireland
of
what
we
call
the
second
sight
second
sight
what
kind
of
sight
might
that
be
why
you
know
our
ignorant
people
pretend
that
some
are
able
to
foresee
what
is
to
come--sometimes
in
a
glass
or
in
the
air
maybe
and
at
kildonan
we
had
an
old
woman
that
pretended
to
such
a
power
and
i
daresay
i
coloured
the
matter
more
highly
than
i
should
but
i
never
dreamed
frank
would
take
it
so
near
as
he
did
you
were
wrong
my
lord
very
wrong
in
meddling
with
such
superstitious
matters
at
all
and
you
should
have
considered
whose
house
you
were
in
and
how
little
becoming
such
actions
are
to
my
character
and
person
or
to
your
own
but
pray
how
came
it
that
you
acting
as
you
say
a
play
should
fall
upon
anything
that
could
so
alarm
frank
that
is
what
i
can
hardly
tell
sir
he
passed
all
in
a
moment
from
rant
about
battles
and
lovers
and
cleodora
and
antigenes
to
something
i
could
not
follow
at
all
and
then
dropped
down
as
you
saw
yes
was
that
at
the
moment
when
you
laid
your
hand
on
the
top
of
his
head
lord
saul
gave
a
quick
look
at
his
questioner--quick
and
spiteful--and
for
the
first
time
seemed
unready
with
an
answer
about
that
time
it
may
have
been
he
said
i
have
tried
to
recollect
myself
but
i
am
not
sure
there
was
at
any
rate
no
significance
in
what
i
did
then
ah
said
dr
ashton
well
my
lord
i
should
do
wrong
were
i
not
to
tell
you
that
this
fright
of
my
poor
nephew
may
have
very
ill
consequences
to
him
the
doctor
speaks
very
despondingly
of
his
state
lord
saul
pressed
his
hands
together
and
looked
earnestly
upon
dr
ashton
i
am
willing
to
believe
you
had
no
bad
intention
as
assuredly
you
could
have
no
reason
to
bear
the
poor
boy
malice
but
i
cannot
wholly
free
you
from
blame
in
the
affair
as
he
spoke
the
hurrying
steps
were
heard
again
and
mrs
ashton
came
quickly
into
the
room
carrying
a
candle
for
the
evening
had
by
this
time
closed
in
she
was
greatly
agitated
o
come
she
cried
come
directly
i'm
sure
he
is
going
going
frank
is
it
possible
already
with
some
such
incoherent
words
the
doctor
caught
up
a
book
of
prayers
from
the
table
and
ran
out
after
his
wife
lord
saul
stopped
for
a
moment
where
he
was
molly
the
maid
saw
him
bend
over
and
put
both
hands
to
his
face
if
it
were
the
last
words
she
had
to
speak
she
said
afterwards
he
was
striving
to
keep
back
a
fit
of
laughing
then
he
went
out
softly
following
the
others
mrs
ashton
was
sadly
right
in
her
forecast
i
have
no
inclination
to
imagine
the
last
scene
in
detail
what
dr
ashton
records
is
or
may
be
taken
to
be
important
to
the
story
they
asked
frank
if
he
would
like
to
see
his
companion
lord
saul
once
again
the
boy
was
quite
collected
it
appears
in
these
moments
no
he
said
i
do
not
want
to
see
him
but
you
should
tell
him
i
am
afraid
he
will
be
very
cold
what
do
you
mean
my
dear
said
mrs
ashton
only
that
said
frank
but
say
to
him
besides
that
i
am
free
of
them
now
but
he
should
take
care
and
i
am
sorry
about
your
black
cockerel
aunt
ashton
but
he
said
we
must
use
it
so
if
we
were
to
see
all
that
could
be
seen
not
many
minutes
after
he
was
gone
both
the
ashtons
were
grieved
she
naturally
most
but
the
doctor
though
not
an
emotional
man
felt
the
pathos
of
the
early
death
and
besides
there
was
the
growing
suspicion
that
all
had
not
been
told
him
by
saul
and
that
there
was
something
here
which
was
out
of
his
beaten
track
when
he
left
the
chamber
of
death
it
was
to
walk
across
the
quadrangle
of
the
residence
to
the
sexton's
house
a
passing
bell
the
greatest
of
the
minster
bells
must
be
rung
a
grave
must
be
dug
in
the
minster
yard
and
there
was
now
no
need
to
silence
the
chiming
of
the
minster
clock
as
he
came
slowly
back
in
the
dark
he
thought
he
must
see
lord
saul
again
that
matter
of
the
black
cockerel--trifling
as
it
might
seem--would
have
to
be
cleared
up
it
might
be
merely
a
fancy
of
the
sick
boy
but
if
not
was
there
not
a
witch-trial
he
had
read
in
which
some
grim
little
rite
of
sacrifice
had
played
a
part
yes
he
must
see
saul
i
rather
guess
these
thoughts
of
his
than
find
written
authority
for
them
that
there
was
another
interview
is
certain
certain
also
that
saul
would
or
as
he
said
could
throw
no
light
on
frank's
words
though
the
message
or
some
part
of
it
appeared
to
affect
him
horribly
but
there
is
no
record
of
the
talk
in
detail
it
is
only
said
that
saul
sat
all
that
evening
in
the
study
and
when
he
bid
good-night
which
he
did
most
reluctantly
asked
for
the
doctor's
prayers
the
month
of
january
was
near
its
end
when
lord
kildonan
in
the
embassy
at
lisbon
received
a
letter
that
for
once
gravely
disturbed
that
vain
man
and
neglectful
father
saul
was
dead
the
scene
at
frank's
burial
had
been
very
distressing
the
day
was
awful
in
blackness
and
wind
the
bearers
staggering
blindly
along
under
the
flapping
black
pall
found
it
a
hard
job
when
they
emerged
from
the
porch
of
the
minster
to
make
their
way
to
the
grave
mrs
ashton
was
in
her
room--women
did
not
then
go
to
their
kinsfolk's
funerals--but
saul
was
there
draped
in
the
mourning
cloak
of
the
time
and
his
face
was
white
and
fixed
as
that
of
one
dead
except
when
as
was
noticed
three
or
four
times
he
suddenly
turned
his
head
to
the
left
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
it
was
then
alive
with
a
terrible
expression
of
listening
fear
no
one
saw
him
go
away
and
no
one
could
find
him
that
evening
all
night
the
gale
buffeted
the
high
windows
of
the
church
and
howled
over
the
upland
and
roared
through
the
woodland
it
was
useless
to
search
in
the
open
no
voice
of
shouting
or
cry
for
help
could
possibly
be
heard
all
that
dr
ashton
could
do
was
to
warn
the
people
about
the
college
and
the
town
constables
and
to
sit
up
on
the
alert
for
any
news
and
this
he
did
news
came
early
next
morning
brought
by
the
sexton
whose
business
it
was
to
open
the
church
for
early
prayers
at
seven
and
who
sent
the
maid
rushing
upstairs
with
wild
eyes
and
flying
hair
to
summon
her
master
the
two
men
dashed
across
to
the
south
door
of
the
minster
there
to
find
lord
saul
clinging
desperately
to
the
great
ring
of
the
door
his
head
sunk
between
his
shoulders
his
stockings
in
rags
his
shoes
gone
his
legs
torn
and
bloody
this
was
what
had
to
be
told
to
lord
kildonan
and
this
really
ends
the
first
part
of
the
story
the
tomb
of
frank
sydall
and
of
the
lord
viscount
saul
only
child
and
heir
to
william
earl
of
kildonan
is
one
a
stone
altar
tomb
in
whitminster
churchyard
dr
ashton
lived
on
for
over
thirty
years
in
his
prebendal
house
i
do
not
know
how
quietly
but
without
visible
disturbance
his
successor
preferred
a
house
he
already
owned
in
the
town
and
left
that
of
the
senior
prebendary
vacant
between
them
these
two
men
saw
the
eighteenth
century
out
and
the
nineteenth
in
for
mr
hindes
the
successor
of
ashton
became
prebendary
at
nine-and-twenty
and
died
at
nine-and-eighty
so
that
it
was
not
till
1823
or
1824
that
any
one
succeeded
to
the
post
who
intended
to
make
the
house
his
home
the
man
who
did
was
dr
henry
oldys
whose
name
may
be
known
to
some
of
my
readers
as
that
of
the
author
of
a
row
of
volumes
labelled
oldys's
works
which
occupy
a
place
that
must
be
honoured
since
it
is
so
rarely
touched
upon
the
shelves
of
many
a
substantial
library
dr
oldys
his
niece
and
his
servants
took
some
months
to
transfer
furniture
and
books
from
his
dorsetshire
parsonage
to
the
quadrangle
of
whitminster
and
to
get
everything
into
place
but
eventually
the
work
was
done
and
the
house
which
though
untenanted
had
always
been
kept
sound
and
weather-tight
woke
up
and
like
monte
cristo's
mansion
at
auteuil
lived
sang
and
bloomed
once
more
on
a
certain
morning
in
june
it
looked
especially
fair
as
dr
oldys
strolled
in
his
garden
before
breakfast
and
gazed
over
the
red
roof
at
the
minster
tower
with
its
four
gold
vanes
backed
by
a
very
blue
sky
and
very
white
little
clouds
mary
he
said
as
he
seated
himself
at
the
breakfast
table
and
laid
down
something
hard
and
shiny
on
the
cloth
here's
a
find
which
the
boy
made
just
now
you'll
be
sharper
than
i
if
you
can
guess
what
it's
meant
for
it
was
a
round
and
perfectly
smooth
tablet--as
much
as
an
inch
thick--of
what
seemed
clear
glass
it
is
rather
attractive
at
all
events
said
mary
she
was
a
fair
woman
with
light
hair
and
large
eyes
rather
a
devotee
of
literature
yes
said
her
uncle
i
thought
you'd
be
pleased
with
it
i
presume
it
came
from
the
house
it
turned
up
in
the
rubbish-heap
in
the
corner
i'm
not
sure
that
i
do
like
it
after
all
said
mary
some
minutes
later
why
in
the
world
not
my
dear
i
don't
know
i'm
sure
perhaps
it's
only
fancy
yes
only
fancy
and
romance
of
course
what's
that
book
now--the
name
of
that
book
i
mean
that
you
had
your
head
in
all
yesterday
the
talisman
uncle
oh
if
this
should
turn
out
to
be
a
talisman
how
enchanting
it
would
be
yes
the
talisman
ah
well
you're
welcome
to
it
whatever
it
is
i
must
be
off
about
my
business
is
all
well
in
the
house
does
it
suit
you
any
complaints
from
the
servants'
hall
no
indeed
nothing
could
be
more
charming
the
only
soupã§on
of
a
complaint
besides
the
lock
of
the
linen
closet
which
i
told
you
of
is
that
mrs
maple
says
she
cannot
get
rid
of
the
sawflies
out
of
that
room
you
pass
through
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
by
the
way
are
you
sure
you
like
your
bedroom
it
is
a
long
way
off
from
any
one
else
you
know
like
it
to
be
sure
i
do
the
further
off
from
you
my
dear
the
better
there
don't
think
it
necessary
to
beat
me
accept
my
apologies
but
what
are
sawflies
will
they
eat
my
coats
if
not
they
may
have
the
room
to
themselves
for
what
i
care
we
are
not
likely
to
be
using
it
no
of
course
not
well
what
she
calls
sawflies
are
those
reddish
things
like
a
daddy-longlegs
but
smaller1
and
there
are
a
great
many
of
them
perching
about
that
room
certainly
i
don't
like
them
but
i
don't
fancy
they
are
mischievous
there
seem
to
be
several
things
you
don't
like
this
fine
morning
said
her
uncle
as
he
closed
the
door
miss
oldys
remained
in
her
chair
looking
at
the
tablet
which
she
was
holding
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
the
smile
that
had
been
on
her
face
faded
slowly
from
it
and
gave
place
to
an
expression
of
curiosity
and
almost
strained
attention
her
reverie
was
broken
by
the
entrance
of
mrs
maple
and
her
invariable
opening
oh
miss
could
i
speak
to
you
a
minute
a
letter
from
miss
oldys
to
a
friend
in
lichfield
begun
a
day
or
two
before
is
the
next
source
for
this
story
it
is
not
devoid
of
traces
of
the
influence
of
that
leader
of
female
thought
in
her
day
miss
anna
seward
known
to
some
as
the
swan
of
lichfield
my
sweetest
emily
will
be
rejoiced
to
hear
that
we
are
at
length--my
beloved
uncle
and
myself--settled
in
the
house
that
now
calls
us
master--nay
master
and
mistress--as
in
past
ages
it
has
called
so
many
others
here
we
taste
a
mingling
of
modern
elegance
and
hoary
antiquity
such
as
has
never
ere
now
graced
life
for
either
of
us
the
town
small
as
it
is
affords
us
some
reflection
pale
indeed
but
veritable
of
the
sweets
of
polite
intercourse
the
adjacent
country
numbers
amid
the
occupants
of
its
scattered
mansions
some
whose
polish
is
annually
refreshed
by
contact
with
metropolitan
splendour
and
others
whose
robust
and
homely
geniality
is
at
times
and
by
way
of
contrast
not
less
cheering
and
acceptable
tired
of
the
parlours
and
drawing-rooms
of
our
friends
we
have
ready
to
hand
a
refuge
from
the
clash
of
wits
or
the
small
talk
of
the
day
amid
the
solemn
beauties
of
our
venerable
minster
whose
silvern
chimes
daily
'knoll
us
to
prayer'
and
in
the
shady
walks
of
whose
tranquil
graveyard
we
muse
with
softened
heart
and
ever
and
anon
with
moistened
eye
upon
the
memorials
of
the
young
the
beautiful
the
aged
the
wise
and
the
good
here
there
is
an
abrupt
break
both
in
the
writing
and
the
style
but
my
dearest
emily
i
can
no
longer
write
with
the
care
which
you
deserve
and
in
which
we
both
take
pleasure
what
i
have
to
tell
you
is
wholly
foreign
to
what
has
gone
before
this
morning
my
uncle
brought
in
to
breakfast
an
object
which
had
been
found
in
the
garden
it
was
a
glass
or
crystal
tablet
of
this
shape
a
little
sketch
is
given
which
he
handed
to
me
and
which
after
he
left
the
room
remained
on
the
table
by
me
i
gazed
at
it
i
know
not
why
for
some
minutes
till
called
away
by
the
day's
duties
and
you
will
smile
incredulously
when
i
say
that
i
seemed
to
myself
to
begin
to
descry
reflected
in
it
objects
and
scenes
which
were
not
in
the
room
where
i
was
you
will
not
however
be
surprised
that
after
such
an
experience
i
took
the
first
opportunity
to
seclude
myself
in
my
room
with
what
i
now
half
believed
to
be
a
talisman
of
mickle
might
i
was
not
disappointed
i
assure
you
emily
by
that
memory
which
is
dearest
to
both
of
us
that
what
i
went
through
this
afternoon
transcends
the
limits
of
what
i
had
before
deemed
credible
in
brief
what
i
saw
seated
in
my
bedroom
in
the
broad
daylight
of
summer
and
looking
into
the
crystal
depth
of
that
small
round
tablet
was
this
first
a
prospect
strange
to
me
of
an
enclosure
of
rough
and
hillocky
grass
with
a
grey
stone
ruin
in
the
midst
and
a
wall
of
rough
stones
about
it
in
this
stood
an
old
and
very
ugly
woman
in
a
red
cloak
and
ragged
skirt
talking
to
a
boy
dressed
in
the
fashion
of
maybe
a
hundred
years
ago
she
put
something
which
glittered
into
his
hand
and
he
something
into
hers
which
i
saw
to
be
money
for
a
single
coin
fell
from
her
trembling
hand
into
the
grass
the
scene
passed--i
should
have
remarked
by
the
way
that
on
the
rough
walls
of
the
enclosure
i
could
distinguish
bones
and
even
a
skull
lying
in
a
disorderly
fashion
next
i
was
looking
upon
two
boys
one
the
figure
of
the
former
vision
the
other
younger
they
were
in
a
plot
of
garden
walled
round
and
this
garden
in
spite
of
the
difference
in
arrangement
and
the
small
size
of
the
trees
i
could
clearly
recognize
as
being
that
upon
which
i
now
look
from
my
window
the
boys
were
engaged
in
some
curious
play
it
seemed
something
was
smouldering
on
the
ground
the
elder
placed
his
hands
upon
it
and
then
raised
them
in
what
i
took
to
be
an
attitude
of
prayer
and
i
saw
and
started
at
seeing
that
on
them
were
deep
stains
of
blood
the
sky
above
was
overcast
the
same
boy
now
turned
his
face
towards
the
wall
of
the
garden
and
beckoned
with
both
his
raised
hands
and
as
he
did
so
i
was
conscious
that
some
moving
objects
were
becoming
visible
over
the
top
of
the
wall--whether
heads
or
other
parts
of
some
animal
or
human
forms
i
could
not
tell
upon
the
instant
the
elder
boy
turned
sharply
seized
the
arm
of
the
younger
who
all
this
time
had
been
poring
over
what
lay
on
the
ground
and
both
hurried
off
i
then
saw
blood
upon
the
grass
a
little
pile
of
bricks
and
what
i
thought
were
black
feathers
scattered
about
that
scene
closed
and
the
next
was
so
dark
that
perhaps
the
full
meaning
of
it
escaped
me
but
what
i
seemed
to
see
was
a
form
at
first
crouching
low
among
trees
or
bushes
that
were
being
threshed
by
a
violent
wind
then
running
very
swiftly
and
constantly
turning
a
pale
face
to
look
behind
him
as
if
he
feared
a
pursuer
and
indeed
pursuers
were
following
hard
after
him
their
shapes
were
but
dimly
seen
their
number--three
or
four
perhaps
only
guessed
i
suppose
they
were
on
the
whole
more
like
dogs
than
anything
else
but
dogs
such
as
we
have
seen
they
assuredly
were
not
could
i
have
closed
my
eyes
to
this
horror
i
would
have
done
so
at
once
but
i
was
helpless
the
last
i
saw
was
the
victim
darting
beneath
an
arch
and
clutching
at
some
object
to
which
he
clung
and
those
that
were
pursuing
him
overtook
him
and
i
seemed
to
hear
the
echo
of
a
cry
of
despair
it
may
be
that
i
became
unconscious
certainly
i
had
the
sensation
of
awaking
to
the
light
of
day
after
an
interval
of
darkness
such
in
literal
truth
emily
was
my
vision--i
can
call
it
by
no
other
name--of
this
afternoon
tell
me
have
i
not
been
the
unwilling
witness
of
some
episode
of
a
tragedy
connected
with
this
very
house
the
letter
is
continued
next
day
the
tale
of
yesterday
was
not
completed
when
i
laid
down
my
pen
i
said
nothing
of
my
experiences
to
my
uncle--you
know
yourself
how
little
his
robust
common-sense
would
be
prepared
to
allow
of
them
and
how
in
his
eyes
the
specific
remedy
would
be
a
black
draught
or
a
glass
of
port
after
a
silent
evening
then--silent
not
sullen--i
retired
to
rest
judge
of
my
terror
when
not
yet
in
bed
i
heard
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
distant
bellow
and
knew
it
for
my
uncle's
voice
though
never
in
my
hearing
so
exerted
before
his
sleeping-room
is
at
the
further
extremity
of
this
large
house
and
to
gain
access
to
it
one
must
traverse
an
antique
hall
some
eighty
feet
long
and
a
lofty
panelled
chamber
and
two
unoccupied
bedrooms
in
the
second
of
these--a
room
almost
devoid
of
furniture--i
found
him
in
the
dark
his
candle
lying
smashed
on
the
floor
as
i
ran
in
bearing
a
light
he
clasped
me
in
arms
that
trembled
for
the
first
time
since
i
have
known
him
thanked
god
and
hurried
me
out
of
the
room
he
would
say
nothing
of
what
had
alarmed
him
'to-morrow
to-morrow'
was
all
i
could
get
from
him
a
bed
was
hastily
improvised
for
him
in
the
room
next
to
my
own
i
doubt
if
his
night
was
more
restful
than
mine
i
could
only
get
to
sleep
in
the
small
hours
when
daylight
was
already
strong
and
then
my
dreams
were
of
the
grimmest--particularly
one
which
stamped
itself
on
my
brain
and
which
i
must
set
down
on
the
chance
of
dispersing
the
impression
it
has
made
it
was
that
i
came
up
to
my
room
with
a
heavy
foreboding
of
evil
oppressing
me
and
went
with
a
hesitation
and
reluctance
i
could
not
explain
to
my
chest
of
drawers
i
opened
the
top
drawer
in
which
was
nothing
but
ribbons
and
handkerchiefs
and
then
the
second
where
was
as
little
to
alarm
and
then
o
heavens
the
third
and
last
and
there
was
a
mass
of
linen
neatly
folded
upon
which
as
i
looked
with
curiosity
that
began
to
be
tinged
with
horror
i
perceived
a
movement
in
it
and
a
pink
hand
was
thrust
out
of
the
folds
and
began
to
grope
feebly
in
the
air
i
could
bear
it
no
more
and
rushed
from
the
room
clapping
the
door
after
me
and
strove
with
all
my
force
to
lock
it
but
the
key
would
not
turn
in
the
wards
and
from
within
the
room
came
a
sound
of
rustling
and
bumping
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
door
why
i
did
not
flee
down
the
stairs
i
know
not
i
continued
grasping
the
handle
and
mercifully
as
the
door
was
plucked
from
my
hand
with
an
irresistible
force
i
awoke
you
may
not
think
this
very
alarming
but
i
assure
you
it
was
so
to
me
at
breakfast
to-day
my
uncle
was
very
uncommunicative
and
i
think
ashamed
of
the
fright
he
had
given
us
but
afterwards
he
inquired
of
me
whether
mr
spearman
was
still
in
town
adding
that
he
thought
that
was
a
young
man
who
had
some
sense
left
in
his
head
i
think
you
know
my
dear
emily
that
i
am
not
inclined
to
disagree
with
him
there
and
also
that
i
was
not
unlikely
to
be
able
to
answer
his
question
to
mr
spearman
he
accordingly
went
and
i
have
not
seen
him
since
i
must
send
this
strange
budget
of
news
to
you
now
or
it
may
have
to
wait
over
more
than
one
post
the
reader
will
not
be
far
out
if
he
guesses
that
miss
mary
and
mr
spearman
made
a
match
of
it
not
very
long
after
this
month
of
june
mr
spearman
was
a
young
spark
who
had
a
good
property
in
the
neighbourhood
of
whitminster
and
not
unfrequently
about
this
time
spent
a
few
days
at
the
king's
head
ostensibly
on
business
but
he
must
have
had
some
leisure
for
his
diary
is
copious
especially
for
the
days
of
which
i
am
telling
the
story
it
is
probable
to
me
that
he
wrote
this
episode
as
fully
as
he
could
at
the
bidding
of
miss
mary
uncle
oldys
how
i
hope
i
may
have
the
right
to
call
him
so
before
long
called
this
morning
after
throwing
out
a
good
many
short
remarks
on
indifferent
topics
he
said
'i
wish
spearman
you'd
listen
to
an
odd
story
and
keep
a
close
tongue
about
it
just
for
a
bit
till
i
get
more
light
on
it'
'to
be
sure'
said
i
'you
may
count
on
me'
'i
don't
know
what
to
make
of
it'
he
said
'you
know
my
bedroom
it
is
well
away
from
every
one
else's
and
i
pass
through
the
great
hall
and
two
or
three
other
rooms
to
get
to
it'
'is
it
at
the
end
next
the
minster
then'
i
asked
'yes
it
is
well
now
yesterday
morning
my
mary
told
me
that
the
room
next
before
it
was
infested
with
some
sort
of
fly
that
the
housekeeper
couldn't
get
rid
of
that
may
be
the
explanation
or
it
may
not
what
do
you
think'
'why'
said
i
'you've
not
yet
told
me
what
has
to
be
explained'
'true
enough
i
don't
believe
i
have
but
by-the-by
what
are
these
sawflies
what's
the
size
of
them'
i
began
to
wonder
if
he
was
touched
in
the
head
'what
i
call
a
sawfly'
i
said
very
patiently
'is
a
red
animal
like
a
daddy-longlegs
but
not
so
big
perhaps
an
inch
long
perhaps
less
it
is
very
hard
in
the
body
and
to
me'--i
was
going
to
say
'particularly
offensive'
but
he
broke
in
'come
come
an
inch
or
less
that
won't
do'
'i
can
only
tell
you'
i
said
'what
i
know
would
it
not
be
better
if
you
told
me
from
first
to
last
what
it
is
that
has
puzzled
you
and
then
i
may
be
able
to
give
you
some
kind
of
an
opinion'
he
gazed
at
me
meditatively
'perhaps
it
would'
he
said
'i
told
mary
only
to-day
that
i
thought
you
had
some
vestiges
of
sense
in
your
head'
i
bowed
my
acknowledgements
'the
thing
is
i've
an
odd
kind
of
shyness
about
talking
of
it
nothing
of
the
sort
has
happened
to
me
before
well
about
eleven
o'clock
last
night
or
after
i
took
my
candle
and
set
out
for
my
room
i
had
a
book
in
my
other
hand--i
always
read
something
for
a
few
minutes
before
i
drop
off
to
sleep
a
dangerous
habit
i
don't
recommend
it
but
i
know
how
to
manage
my
light
and
my
bed
curtains
now
then
first
as
i
stepped
out
of
my
study
into
the
great
half
that's
next
to
it
and
shut
the
door
my
candle
went
out
i
supposed
i
had
clapped
the
door
behind
me
too
quick
and
made
a
draught
and
i
was
annoyed
for
i'd
no
tinder-box
nearer
than
my
bedroom
but
i
knew
my
way
well
enough
and
went
on
the
next
thing
was
that
my
book
was
struck
out
of
my
hand
in
the
dark
if
i
said
twitched
out
of
my
hand
it
would
better
express
the
sensation
it
fell
on
the
floor
i
picked
it
up
and
went
on
more
annoyed
than
before
and
a
little
startled
but
as
you
know
that
hall
has
many
windows
without
curtains
and
in
summer
nights
like
these
it
is
easy
to
see
not
only
where
the
furniture
is
but
whether
there's
any
one
or
anything
moving
and
there
was
no
one--nothing
of
the
kind
so
on
i
went
through
the
hall
and
through
the
audit
chamber
next
to
it
which
also
has
big
windows
and
then
into
the
bedrooms
which
lead
to
my
own
where
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
i
had
to
go
slower
because
of
steps
here
and
there
it
was
in
the
second
of
those
rooms
that
i
nearly
got
my
quietus
the
moment
i
opened
the
door
of
it
i
felt
there
was
something
wrong
i
thought
twice
i
confess
whether
i
shouldn't
turn
back
and
find
another
way
there
is
to
my
room
rather
than
go
through
that
one
then
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
and
thought
what
people
call
better
of
it
though
i
don't
know
about
better
in
this
case
if
i
was
to
describe
my
experience
exactly
i
should
say
this
there
was
a
dry
light
rustling
sound
all
over
the
room
as
i
went
in
and
then
you
remember
it
was
perfectly
dark
something
seemed
to
rush
at
me
and
there
was--i
don't
know
how
to
put
it--a
sensation
of
long
thin
arms
or
legs
or
feelers
all
about
my
face
and
neck
and
body
very
little
strength
in
them
there
seemed
to
be
but
spearman
i
don't
think
i
was
ever
more
horrified
or
disgusted
in
all
my
life
that
i
remember
and
it
does
take
something
to
put
me
out
i
roared
out
as
loud
as
i
could
and
flung
away
my
candle
at
random
and
knowing
i
was
near
the
window
i
tore
at
the
curtain
and
somehow
let
in
enough
light
to
be
able
to
see
something
waving
which
i
knew
was
an
insect's
leg
by
the
shape
of
it
but
lord
what
a
size
why
the
beast
must
have
been
as
tall
as
i
am
and
now
you
tell
me
sawflies
are
an
inch
long
or
less
what
do
you
make
of
it
spearman'
'for
goodness
sake
finish
your
story
first'
i
said
'i
never
heard
anything
like
it'
'oh'
said
he
'there's
no
more
to
tell
mary
ran
in
with
a
light
and
there
was
nothing
there
i
didn't
tell
her
what
was
the
matter
i
changed
my
room
for
last
night
and
i
expect
for
good'
'have
you
searched
this
odd
room
of
yours'
i
said
'what
do
you
keep
in
it'
'we
don't
use
it'
he
answered
'there's
an
old
press
there
and
some
little
other
furniture'
'and
in
the
press'
said
i
'i
don't
know
i
never
saw
it
opened
but
i
do
know
that
it's
locked'
'well
i
should
have
it
looked
into
and
if
you
had
time
i
own
to
having
some
curiosity
to
see
the
place
myself'
'i
didn't
exactly
like
to
ask
you
but
that's
rather
what
i
hoped
you'd
say
name
your
time
and
i'll
take
you
there'
'no
time
like
the
present'
i
said
at
once
for
i
saw
he
would
never
settle
down
to
anything
while
this
affair
was
in
suspense
he
got
up
with
great
alacrity
and
looked
at
me
i
am
tempted
to
think
with
marked
approval
'come
along'
was
all
he
said
however
and
was
pretty
silent
all
the
way
to
his
house
my
mary
as
he
calls
her
in
public
and
i
in
private
was
summoned
and
we
proceeded
to
the
room
the
doctor
had
gone
so
far
as
to
tell
her
that
he
had
had
something
of
a
fright
there
last
night
of
what
nature
he
had
not
yet
divulged
but
now
he
pointed
out
and
described
very
briefly
the
incidents
of
his
progress
when
we
were
near
the
important
spot
he
pulled
up
and
allowed
me
to
pass
on
'there's
the
room'
he
said
'go
in
spearman
and
tell
us
what
you
find'
whatever
i
might
have
felt
at
midnight
noonday
i
was
sure
would
keep
back
anything
sinister
and
i
flung
the
door
open
with
an
air
and
stepped
in
it
was
a
well-lighted
room
with
its
large
window
on
the
right
though
not
i
thought
a
very
airy
one
the
principal
piece
of
furniture
was
the
gaunt
old
press
of
dark
wood
there
was
too
a
four-post
bedstead
a
mere
skeleton
which
could
hide
nothing
and
there
was
a
chest
of
drawers
on
the
window-sill
and
the
floor
near
it
were
the
dead
bodies
of
many
hundred
sawflies
and
one
torpid
one
which
i
had
some
satisfaction
in
killing
i
tried
the
door
of
the
press
but
could
not
open
it
the
drawers
too
were
locked
somewhere
i
was
conscious
there
was
a
faint
rustling
sound
but
i
could
not
locate
it
and
when
i
made
my
report
to
those
outside
i
said
nothing
of
it
but
i
said
clearly
the
next
thing
was
to
see
what
was
in
those
locked
receptacles
uncle
oldys
turned
to
mary
'mrs
maple'
he
said
and
mary
ran
off--no
one
i
am
sure
steps
like
her--and
soon
came
back
at
a
soberer
pace
with
an
elderly
lady
of
discreet
aspect
'have
you
the
keys
of
these
things
mrs
maple'
said
uncle
oldys
his
simple
words
let
loose
a
torrent
not
violent
but
copious
of
speech
had
she
been
a
shade
or
two
higher
in
the
social
scale
mrs
maple
might
have
stood
as
the
model
for
miss
bates
'oh
doctor
and
miss
and
you
too
sir'
she
said
acknowledging
my
presence
with
a
bend
'them
keys
who
was
that
again
that
come
when
first
we
took
over
things
in
this
house--a
gentleman
in
business
it
was
and
i
gave
him
his
luncheon
in
the
small
parlour
on
account
of
us
not
having
everything
as
we
should
like
to
see
it
in
the
large
one--chicken
and
apple-pie
and
a
glass
of
madeira--dear
dear
you'll
say
i'm
running
on
miss
mary
but
i
only
mention
it
to
bring
back
my
recollection
and
there
it
comes--gardner
just
the
same
as
it
did
last
week
with
the
artichokes
and
the
text
of
the
sermon
now
that
mr
gardner
every
key
i
got
from
him
were
labelled
to
itself
and
each
and
every
one
was
a
key
of
some
door
or
another
in
this
house
and
sometimes
two
and
when
i
say
door
my
meaning
is
door
of
a
room
not
like
such
a
press
as
this
is
yes
miss
mary
i
know
full
well
and
i'm
just
making
it
clear
to
your
uncle
and
you
too
sir
but
now
there
was
a
box
which
this
same
gentleman
he
give
over
into
my
charge
and
thinking
no
harm
after
he
was
gone
i
took
the
liberty
knowing
it
was
your
uncle's
property
to
rattle
it
and
unless
i'm
most
surprisingly
deceived
in
that
box
there
was
keys
but
what
keys
that
doctor
is
known
elsewhere
for
open
the
box
no
that
i
would
not
do'
i
wondered
that
uncle
oldys
remained
as
quiet
as
he
did
under
this
address
mary
i
knew
was
amused
by
it
and
he
probably
had
been
taught
by
experience
that
it
was
useless
to
break
in
upon
it
at
any
rate
he
did
not
but
merely
said
at
the
end
'have
you
that
box
handy
mrs
maple
if
so
you
might
bring
it
here'
mrs
maple
pointed
her
finger
at
him
either
in
accusation
or
in
gloomy
triumph
'there'
she
said
'was
i
to
choose
out
the
very
words
out
of
your
mouth
doctor
them
would
be
the
ones
and
if
i've
took
it
to
my
own
rebuke
one
half-a-dozen
times
it's
been
nearer
fifty
laid
awake
i
have
in
my
bed
sat
down
in
my
chair
i
have
the
same
you
and
miss
mary
gave
me
the
day
i
was
twenty
year
in
your
service
and
no
person
could
desire
a
better--yes
miss
mary
but
it
is
the
truth
and
well
we
know
who
it
is
would
have
it
different
if
he
could
all
very
well
says
i
to
myself
but
pray
when
the
doctor
calls
you
to
account
for
that
box
what
are
you
going
to
say
no
doctor
if
you
was
some
masters
i've
heard
of
and
i
was
some
servants
i
could
name
i
should
have
an
easy
task
before
me
but
things
being
humanly
speaking
what
they
are
the
one
course
open
to
me
is
just
to
say
to
you
that
without
miss
mary
comes
to
my
room
and
helps
me
to
my
recollection
which
her
wits
may
manage
what's
slipped
beyond
mine
no
such
box
as
that
small
though
it
be
will
cross
your
eyes
this
many
a
day
to
come'
'why
dear
mrs
maple
why
didn't
you
tell
me
before
that
you
wanted
me
to
help
you
to
find
it'
said
my
mary
'no
never
mind
telling
me
why
it
was
let
us
come
at
once
and
look
for
it'
they
hastened
off
together
i
could
hear
mrs
maple
beginning
an
explanation
which
i
doubt
not
lasted
into
the
furthest
recesses
of
the
housekeeper's
department
uncle
oldys
and
i
were
left
alone
'a
valuable
servant'
he
said
nodding
towards
the
door
'nothing
goes
wrong
under
her
the
speeches
are
seldom
over
three
minutes'
'how
will
miss
oldys
manage
to
make
her
remember
about
the
box'
i
asked
'mary
oh
she'll
make
her
sit
down
and
ask
her
about
her
aunt's
last
illness
or
who
gave
her
the
china
dog
on
the
mantel-piece--something
quite
off
the
point
then
as
maple
says
one
thing
brings
up
another
and
the
right
one
will
come
round
sooner
than
you
could
suppose
there
i
believe
i
hear
them
coming
back
already'
it
was
indeed
so
and
mrs
maple
was
hurrying
on
ahead
of
mary
with
the
box
in
her
outstretched
hand
and
a
beaming
face
'what
was
it'
she
cried
as
she
drew
near
'what
was
it
as
i
said
before
ever
i
come
out
of
dorsetshire
to
this
place
not
that
i'm
a
dorset
woman
myself
nor
had
need
to
be
safe
bind
safe
find
and
there
it
was
in
the
place
where
i'd
put
it--what--two
months
back
i
daresay'
she
handed
it
to
uncle
oldys
and
he
and
i
examined
it
with
some
interest
so
that
i
ceased
to
pay
attention
to
mrs
ann
maple
for
the
moment
though
i
know
that
she
went
on
to
expound
exactly
where
the
box
had
been
and
in
what
way
mary
had
helped
to
refresh
her
memory
on
the
subject
it
was
an
oldish
box
tied
with
pink
tape
and
sealed
and
on
the
lid
was
pasted
a
label
inscribed
in
old
ink
'the
senior
prebendary's
house
whitminster'
on
being
opened
it
was
found
to
contain
two
keys
of
moderate
size
and
a
paper
on
which
in
the
same
hand
as
the
label
was
'keys
of
the
press
and
box
of
drawers
standing
in
the
disused
chamber'
also
this
'the
effects
in
this
press
and
box
are
held
by
me
and
to
be
held
by
my
successors
in
the
residence
in
trust
for
the
noble
family
of
kildonan
if
claim
be
made
by
any
survivor
of
it
i
having
made
all
the
enquiry
possible
to
myself
am
of
the
opinion
that
that
noble
house
is
wholly
extinct
the
last
earl
having
been
as
is
notorious
cast
away
at
sea
and
his
only
child
and
heire
deceas'd
in
my
house
the
papers
as
to
which
melancholy
casualty
were
by
me
repos'd
in
the
same
press
in
this
year
of
our
lord
1753
21
march
i
am
further
of
opinion
that
unless
grave
discomfort
arise
such
persons
not
being
of
the
family
of
kildonan
as
shall
become
possess'd
of
these
keys
will
be
well
advised
to
leave
matters
as
they
are
which
opinion
i
do
not
express
without
weighty
and
sufficient
reason
and
am
happy
to
have
my
judgment
confirm'd
by
the
other
members
of
this
college
and
church
who
are
conversant
with
the
events
referr'd
to
in

'ah'
said
uncle
oldys
'grave
discomfort
so
he
thought
there
might
be
something
i
suspect
it
was
that
young
man'
he
went
on
pointing
with
the
key
to
the
line
about
the
'only
child
and
heire'
'eh
mary
the
viscounty
of
kildonan
was
saul'
'how
do
you
know
that
uncle'
said
mary
'oh
why
not
it's
all
in
debrett--two
little
fat
books
but
i
meant
the
tomb
by
the
lime
walk
he's
there
what's
the
story
i
wonder
do
you
know
it
mrs
maple
and
by
the
way
look
at
your
sawflies
by
the
window
there'
mrs
maple
thus
confronted
with
two
subjects
at
once
was
a
little
put
to
it
to
do
justice
to
both
it
was
no
doubt
rash
in
uncle
oldys
to
give
her
the
opportunity
i
could
only
guess
that
he
had
some
slight
hesitation
about
using
the
key
he
held
in
his
hand
'oh
them
flies
how
bad
they
was
doctor
and
miss
this
three
or
four
days
and
you
too
sir
you
wouldn't
guess
none
of
you
and
how
they
come
too
first
we
took
the
room
in
hand
the
shutters
was
up
and
had
been
i
daresay
years
upon
years
and
not
a
fly
to
be
seen
then
we
got
the
shutter
bars
down
with
a
deal
of
trouble
and
left
it
so
for
the
day
and
next
day
i
sent
susan
in
with
the
broom
to
sweep
about
and
not
two
minutes
hadn't
passed
when
out
she
come
into
the
hall
like
a
blind
thing
and
we
had
regular
to
beat
them
off
her
why
her
cap
and
her
hair
you
couldn't
see
the
colour
of
it
i
do
assure
you
and
all
clustering
round
her
eyes
too
fortunate
enough
she's
not
a
girl
with
fancies
else
if
it
had
been
me
why
only
the
tickling
of
the
nasty
things
would
have
drove
me
out
of
my
wits
and
now
there
they
lay
like
so
many
dead
things
well
they
was
lively
enough
on
the
monday
and
now
here's
thursday
is
it
or
no
friday
only
to
come
near
the
door
and
you'd
hear
them
pattering
up
against
it
and
once
you
opened
it
dash
at
you
they
would
as
if
they'd
eat
you
i
couldn't
help
thinking
to
myself
if
you
was
bats
where
should
we
be
this
night
nor
you
can't
cresh
'em
not
like
a
usual
kind
of
a
fly
well
there's
something
to
be
thankful
for
if
we
could
but
learn
by
it
and
then
this
tomb
too'
she
said
hastening
on
to
her
second
point
to
elude
any
chance
of
interruption
'of
them
two
poor
young
lads
i
say
poor
and
yet
when
i
recollect
myself
i
was
at
tea
with
mrs
simpkins
the
sexton's
wife
before
you
come
doctor
and
miss
mary
and
that's
a
family
has
been
in
the
place
what
i
daresay
a
hundred
years
in
that
very
house
and
could
put
their
hand
on
any
tomb
or
yet
grave
in
all
the
yard
and
give
you
name
and
age
and
his
account
of
that
young
man
mr
simpkins's
i
mean
to
say--well'
she
compressed
her
lips
and
nodded
several
times
'tell
us
mrs
maple'
said
mary
'go
on'
said
uncle
oldys
'what
about
him'
said
i
'never
was
such
a
thing
seen
in
this
place
not
since
queen
mary's
times
and
the
pope
and
all'
said
mrs
maple
'why
do
you
know
he
lived
in
this
very
house
him
and
them
that
was
with
him
and
for
all
i
can
tell
in
this
identical
room'
she
shifted
her
feet
uneasily
on
the
floor
'who
was
with
him
do
you
mean
the
people
of
the
house'
said
uncle
oldys
suspiciously
'not
to
call
people
doctor
dear
no'
was
the
answer
'more
what
he
brought
with
him
from
ireland
i
believe
it
was
no
the
people
in
the
house
was
the
last
to
hear
anything
of
his
goings-on
but
in
the
town
not
a
family
but
knew
how
he
stopped
out
at
night
and
them
that
was
with
him
why
they
were
such
as
would
strip
the
skin
from
the
child
in
its
grave
and
a
withered
heart
makes
an
ugly
thin
ghost
says
mr
simpkins
but
they
turned
on
him
at
the
last
he
says
and
there's
the
mark
still
to
be
seen
on
the
minster
door
where
they
run
him
down
and
that's
no
more
than
the
truth
for
i
got
him
to
show
it
to
myself
and
that's
what
he
said
a
lord
he
was
with
a
bible
name
of
a
wicked
king
whatever
his
godfathers
could
have
been
thinking
of'
'saul
was
the
name'
said
uncle
oldys
'to
be
sure
it
was
saul
doctor
and
thank
you
and
now
isn't
it
king
saul
that
we
read
of
raising
up
the
dead
ghost
that
was
slumbering
in
its
tomb
till
he
disturbed
it
and
isn't
that
a
strange
thing
this
young
lord
to
have
such
a
name
and
mr
simpkins's
grandfather
to
see
him
out
of
his
window
of
a
dark
night
going
about
from
one
grave
to
another
in
the
yard
with
a
candle
and
them
that
was
with
him
following
through
the
grass
at
his
heels
and
one
night
him
to
come
right
up
to
old
mr
simpkins's
window
that
gives
on
the
yard
and
press
his
face
up
against
it
to
find
out
if
there
was
any
one
in
the
room
that
could
see
him
and
only
just
time
there
was
for
old
mr
simpkins
to
drop
down
like
quiet
just
under
the
window
and
hold
his
breath
and
not
stir
till
he
heard
him
stepping
away
again
and
this
rustling-like
in
the
grass
after
him
as
he
went
and
then
when
he
looked
out
of
his
window
in
the
morning
there
was
treadings
in
the
grass
and
a
dead
man's
bone
oh
he
was
a
cruel
child
for
certain
but
he
had
to
pay
in
the
end
and
after'
'after'
said
uncle
oldys
with
a
frown
'oh
yes
doctor
night
after
night
in
old
mr
simpkins's
time
and
his
son
that's
our
mr
simpkins's
father
yes
and
our
own
mr
simpkins
too
up
against
that
same
window
particular
when
they've
had
a
fire
of
a
chilly
evening
with
his
face
right
on
the
panes
and
his
hands
fluttering
out
and
his
mouth
open
and
shut
open
and
shut
for
a
minute
or
more
and
then
gone
off
in
the
dark
yard
but
open
the
window
at
such
times
no
that
they
dare
not
do
though
they
could
find
it
in
their
heart
to
pity
the
poor
thing
that
pinched
up
with
the
cold
and
seemingly
fading
away
to
a
nothink
as
the
years
passed
on
well
indeed
i
believe
it
is
no
more
than
the
truth
what
our
mr
simpkins
says
on
his
own
grandfather's
word
a
withered
heart
makes
an
ugly
thin
ghost'
'i
daresay'
said
uncle
oldys
suddenly
so
suddenly
that
mrs
maple
stopped
short
'thank
you
come
away
all
of
you'
'why
uncle'
said
mary
'are
you
not
going
to
open
the
press
after
all'
uncle
oldys
blushed
actually
blushed
'my
dear'
he
said
'you
are
at
liberty
to
call
me
a
coward
or
applaud
me
as
a
prudent
man
whichever
you
please
but
i
am
neither
going
to
open
that
press
nor
that
chest
of
drawers
myself
nor
am
i
going
to
hand
over
the
keys
to
you
or
to
any
other
person
mrs
maple
will
you
kindly
see
about
getting
a
man
or
two
to
move
those
pieces
of
furniture
into
the
garret'
'and
when
they
do
it
mrs
maple'
said
mary
who
seemed
to
me--i
did
not
then
know
why--more
relieved
than
disappointed
by
her
uncle's
decision
'i
have
something
that
i
want
put
with
the
rest
only
quite
a
small
packet'
we
left
that
curious
room
not
unwillingly
i
think
uncle
oldys's
orders
were
carried
out
that
same
day
and
so
concludes
mr
spearman
whitminster
has
a
bluebeard's
chamber
and
i
am
rather
inclined
to
suspect
a
jack-in-the-box
awaiting
some
future
occupant
of
the
residence
of
the
senior

the

a

meeting-place

but
perhaps
even
more
notably
when

are
upon

it
was
in
such
a
sale-room
that
the
remarkable
series
of
events
began
which
were
detailed
to
me
not
many
months
ago
by
the
person
whom
they
principally
affected
namely
mr
james
denton
ma
fsa
etc
etc
some
time
of
trinity
hall
now
or
lately
of
rendcomb
manor
in
the
county
of
warwick
he
on
a
certain
spring
day
not
many
years
since
was
in
london
for
a
few
days
upon
business
connected
principally
with
the
furnishing
of
the
house
which
he
had
just
finished
building
at
rendcomb
it
may
be
a
disappointment
to
you
to
learn
that
rendcomb
manor
was
new
that
i
cannot
help
there
had
no
doubt
been
an
old
house
but
it
was
not
remarkable
for
beauty
or
interest
even
had
it
been
neither
beauty
nor
interest
would
have
enabled
it
to
resist
the
disastrous
fire
which
about
a
couple
of
years
before
the
date
of
my
story
had
razed
it
to
the
ground
i
am
glad
to
say
that
all
that
was
most
valuable
in
it
had
been
saved
and
that
it
was
fully
insured
so
that
it
was
with
a
comparatively
light
heart
that
mr
denton
was
able
to
face
the
task
of
building
a
new
and
considerably
more
convenient
dwelling
for
himself
and
his
aunt
who
constituted
his
whole
mã©nage
being
in
london
with
time
on
his
hands
and
not
far
from
the
sale-room
at
which
i
have
obscurely
hinted
mr
denton
thought
that
he
would
spend
an
hour
there
upon
the
chance
of
finding
among
that
portion
of
the
famous
thomas
collection
of
mss
which
he
knew
to
be
then
on
view
something
bearing
upon
the
history
or
topography
of
his
part
of
warwickshire
he
turned
in
accordingly
purchased
a
catalogue
and
ascended
to
the
sale-room
where
as
usual
the
books
were
disposed
in
cases
and
some
laid
out
upon
the
long
tables
at
the
shelves
or
sitting
about
at
the
tables
were
figures
many
of
whom
were
familiar
to
him
he
exchanged
nods
and
greetings
with
several
and
then
settled
down
to
examine
his
catalogue
and
note
likely
items
he
had
made
good
progress
through
about
two
hundred
of
the
five
hundred
lots--every
now
and
then
rising
to
take
a
volume
from
the
shelf
and
give
it
a
cursory
glance--when
a
hand
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
and
he
looked
up
his
interrupter
was
one
of
those
intelligent
men
with
a
pointed
beard
and
a
flannel
shirt
of
whom
the
last
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
it
seems
to
me
very
prolific
it
is
no
part
of
my
plan
to
repeat
the
whole
conversation
which
ensued
between
the
two
i
must
content
myself
with
stating
that
it
largely
referred
to
common
acquaintances
eg
to
the
nephew
of
mr
denton's
friend
who
had
recently
married
and
settled
in
chelsea
to
the
sister-in-law
of
mr
denton's
friend
who
had
been
seriously
indisposed
but
was
now
better
and
to
a
piece
of
china
which
mr
denton's
friend
had
purchased
some
months
before
at
a
price
much
below
its
true
value
from
which
you
will
rightly
infer
that
the
conversation
was
rather
in
the
nature
of
a
monologue
in
due
time
however
the
friend
bethought
himself
that
mr
denton
was
there
for
a
purpose
and
said
he
what
are
you
looking
out
for
in
particular
i
don't
think
there's
much
in
this
lot
why
i
thought
there
might
be
some
warwickshire
collections
but
i
don't
see
anything
under
warwick
in
the
catalogue
no
apparently
not
said
the
friend
all
the
same
i
believe
i
noticed
something
like
a
warwickshire
diary
what
was
the
name
again
drayton
potter
painter--either
a
p
or
a
d
i
feel
sure
he
turned
over
the
leaves
quickly
yes
here
it
is
poynter
lot
486
that
might
interest
you
there
are
the
books
i
think
out
on
the
table
some
one
has
been
looking
at
them
well
i
must
be
getting
on
good-bye
you'll
look
us
up
won't
you
couldn't
you
come
this
afternoon
we've
got
a
little
music
about
four
well
then
when
you're
next
in
town
he
went
off
mr
denton
looked
at
his
watch
and
found
to
his
confusion
that
he
could
spare
no
more
than
a
moment
before
retrieving
his
luggage
and
going
for
the
train
the
moment
was
just
enough
to
show
him
that
there
were
four
largish
volumes
of
the
diary--that
it
concerned
the
years
about
1710
and
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
good
many
insertions
in
it
of
various
kinds
it
seemed
quite
worth
while
to
leave
a
commission
of
five
and
twenty
pounds
for
it
and
this
he
was
able
to
do
for
his
usual
agent
entered
the
room
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
it
that
evening
he
rejoined
his
aunt
at
their
temporary
abode
which
was
a
small
dower-house
not
many
hundred
yards
from
the
manor
on
the
following
morning
the
two
resumed
a
discussion
that
had
now
lasted
for
some
weeks
as
to
the
equipment
of
the
new
house
mr
denton
laid
before
his
relative
a
statement
of
the
results
of
his
visit
to
town--particulars
of
carpets
of
chairs
of
wardrobes
and
of
bedroom
china
yes
dear
said
his
aunt
but
i
don't
see
any
chintzes
here
did
you
go
to
----
mr
denton
stamped
on
the
floor
where
else
indeed
could
he
have
stamped
oh
dear
oh
dear
he
said
the
one
thing
i
missed
i
am
sorry
the
fact
is
i
was
on
my
way
there
and
i
happened
to
be
passing
robins's
his
aunt
threw
up
her
hands
robins's
then
the
next
thing
will
be
another
parcel
of
horrible
old
books
at
some
outrageous
price
i
do
think
james
when
i
am
taking
all
this
trouble
for
you
you
might
contrive
to
remember
the
one
or
two
things
which
i
specially
begged
you
to
see
after
it's
not
as
if
i
was
asking
it
for
myself
i
don't
know
whether
you
think
i
get
any
pleasure
out
of
it
but
if
so
i
can
assure
you
it's
very
much
the
reverse
the
thought
and
worry
and
trouble
i
have
over
it
you
have
no
idea
of
and
you
have
simply
to
go
to
the
shops
and
order
the
things
mr
denton
interposed
a
moan
of
penitence
oh
aunt----
yes
that's
all
very
well
dear
and
i
don't
want
to
speak
sharply
but
you
must
know
how
very
annoying
it
is
particularly
as
it
delays
the
whole
of
our
business
for
i
can't
tell
how
long
here
is
wednesday--the
simpsons
come
to-morrow
and
you
can't
leave
them
then
on
saturday
we
have
friends
as
you
know
coming
for
tennis
yes
indeed
you
spoke
of
asking
them
yourself
but
of
course
i
had
to
write
the
notes
and
it
is
ridiculous
james
to
look
like
that
we
must
occasionally
be
civil
to
our
neighbours
you
wouldn't
like
to
have
it
said
we
were
perfect
bears
what
was
i
saying
well
anyhow
it
comes
to
this
that
it
must
be
thursday
in
next
week
at
least
before
you
can
go
to
town
again
and
until
we
have
decided
upon
the
chintzes
it
is
impossible
to
settle
upon
one
single
other
thing
mr
denton
ventured
to
suggest
that
as
the
paint
and
wallpapers
had
been
dealt
with
this
was
too
severe
a
view
but
this
his
aunt
was
not
prepared
to
admit
at
the
moment
nor
indeed
was
there
any
proposition
he
could
have
advanced
which
she
would
have
found
herself
able
to
accept
however
as
the
day
went
on
she
receded
a
little
from
this
position
examined
with
lessening
disfavour
the
samples
and
price
lists
submitted
by
her
nephew
and
even
in
some
cases
gave
a
qualified
approval
to
his
choice
as
for
him
he
was
naturally
somewhat
dashed
by
the
consciousness
of
duty
unfulfilled
but
more
so
by
the
prospect
of
a
lawn-tennis
party
which
though
an
inevitable
evil
in
august
he
had
thought
there
was
no
occasion
to
fear
in
may
but
he
was
to
some
extent
cheered
by
the
arrival
on
the
friday
morning
of
an
intimation
that
he
had
secured
at
the
price
of
â£12
10s
the
four
volumes
of
poynter's
manuscript
diary
and
still
more
by
the
arrival
on
the
next
morning
of
the
diary
itself
the
necessity
of
taking
mr
and
mrs
simpson
for
a
drive
in
the
car
on
saturday
morning
and
of
attending
to
his
neighbours
and
guests
that
afternoon
prevented
him
from
doing
more
than
open
the
parcel
until
the
party
had
retired
to
bed
on
the
saturday
night
it
was
then
that
he
made
certain
of
the
fact
which
he
had
before
only
suspected
that
he
had
indeed
acquired
the
diary
of
mr
william
poynter
squire
of
acrington
about
four
miles
from
his
own
parish--that
same
poynter
who
was
for
a
time
a
member
of
the
circle
of
oxford
antiquaries
the
centre
of
which
was
thomas
hearne
and
with
whom
hearne
seems
ultimately
to
have
quarrelled--a
not
uncommon
episode
in
the
career
of
that
excellent
man
as
is
the
case
with
hearne's
own
collections
the
diary
of
poynter
contained
a
good
many
notes
from
printed
books
descriptions
of
coins
and
other
antiquities
that
had
been
brought
to
his
notice
and
drafts
of
letters
on
these
subjects
besides
the
chronicle
of
everyday
events
the
description
in
the
sale-catalogue
had
given
mr
denton
no
idea
of
the
amount
of
interest
which
seemed
to
lie
in
the
book
and
he
sat
up
reading
in
the
first
of
the
four
volumes
until
a
reprehensibly
late
hour
on
the
sunday
morning
after
church
his
aunt
came
into
the
study
and
was
diverted
from
what
she
had
been
going
to
say
to
him
by
the
sight
of
the
four
brown
leather
quartos
on
the
table
what
are
these
she
said
suspiciously
new
aren't
they
oh
are
these
the
things
that
made
you
forget
my
chintzes
i
thought
so
disgusting
what
did
you
give
for
them
i
should
like
to
know
over
ten
pounds
james
it
is
really
sinful
well
if
you
have
money
to
throw
away
on
this
kind
of
thing
there
can
be
no
reason
why
you
should
not
subscribe--and
subscribe
handsomely--to
my
anti-vivisection
league
there
is
not
indeed
james
and
i
shall
be
very
seriously
annoyed
if----
who
did
you
say
wrote
them
old
mr
poynter
of
acrington
well
of
course
there
is
some
interest
in
getting
together
old
papers
about
this
neighbourhood
but
ten
pounds
she
picked
up
one
of
the
volumes--not
that
which
her
nephew
had
been
reading--and
opened
it
at
random
dashing
it
to
the
floor
the
next
instant
with
a
cry
of
disgust
as
a
earwig
fell
from
between
the
pages
mr
denton
picked
it
up
with
a
smothered
expletive
and
said
poor
book
i
think
you're
rather
hard
on
mr
poynter
was
i
my
dear
i
beg
his
pardon
but
you
know
i
cannot
abide
those
horrid
creatures
let
me
see
if
i've
done
any
mischief
no
i
think
all's
well
but
look
here
what
you've
opened
him
on
dear
me
yes
to
be
sure
how
very
interesting
do
unpin
it
james
and
let
me
look
at
it
it
was
a
piece
of
patterned
stuff
about
the
size
of
the
quarto
page
to
which
it
was
fastened
by
an
old-fashioned
pin
james
detached
it
and
handed
it
to
his
aunt
carefully
replacing
the
pin
in
the
paper
now
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
the
fabric
was
but
it
had
a
design
printed
upon
it
which
completely
fascinated
miss
denton
she
went
into
raptures
over
it
held
it
against
the
wall
made
james
do
the
same
that
she
might
retire
to
contemplate
it
from
a
distance
then
pored
over
it
at
close
quarters
and
ended
her
examination
by
expressing
in
the
warmest
terms
her
appreciation
of
the
taste
of
the
ancient
mr
poynter
who
had
had
the
happy
idea
of
preserving
this
sample
in
his
diary
it
is
a
most
charming
pattern
she
said
and
remarkable
too
look
james
how
delightfully
the
lines
ripple
it
reminds
one
of
hair
very
much
doesn't
it
and
then
these
knots
of
ribbon
at
intervals
they
give
just
the
relief
of
colour
that
is
wanted
i
wonder----
i
was
going
to
say
said
james
with
deference
i
wonder
if
it
would
cost
much
to
have
it
copied
for
our
curtains
copied
how
could
you
have
it
copied
james
well
i
don't
know
the
details
but
i
suppose
that
is
a
printed
pattern
and
that
you
could
have
a
block
cut
from
it
in
wood
or
metal
now
really
that
is
a
capital
idea
james
i
am
almost
inclined
to
be
glad
that
you
were
so--that
you
forgot
the
chintzes
on
monday
at
any
rate
i'll
promise
to
forgive
and
forget
if
you
get
this
lovely
old
thing
copied
no
one
will
have
anything
in
the
least
like
it
and
mind
james
we
won't
allow
it
to
be
sold
now
i
must
go
and
i've
totally
forgotten
what
it
was
i
came
in
to
say
never
mind
it'll
keep
after
his
aunt
had
gone
james
denton
devoted
a
few
minutes
to
examining
the
pattern
more
closely
than
he
had
yet
had
a
chance
of
doing
he
was
puzzled
to
think
why
it
should
have
struck
miss
benton
so
forcibly
it
seemed
to
him
not
specially
remarkable
or
pretty
no
doubt
it
was
suitable
enough
for
a
curtain
pattern
it
ran
in
vertical
bands
and
there
was
some
indication
that
these
were
intended
to
converge
at
the
top
she
was
right
too
in
thinking
that
these
main
bands
resembled
rippling--almost
curling--tresses
of
hair
well
the
main
thing
was
to
find
out
by
means
of
trade
directories
or
otherwise
what
firm
would
undertake
the
reproduction
of
an
old
pattern
of
this
kind
not
to
delay
the
reader
over
this
portion
of
the
story
a
list
of
likely
names
was
made
out
and
mr
denton
fixed
a
day
for
calling
on
them
or
some
of
them
with
his
sample
the
first
two
visits
which
he
paid
were
unsuccessful
but
there
is
luck
in
odd
numbers
the
firm
in
bermondsey
which
was
third
on
his
list
was
accustomed
to
handling
this
line
the
evidence
they
were
able
to
produce
justified
their
being
entrusted
with
the
job
our
mr
cattell
took
a
fervent
personal
interest
in
it
it's
'eartrending
isn't
it
sir
he
said
to
picture
the
quantity
of
reelly
lovely
medeevial
stuff
of
this
kind
that
lays
well-nigh
unnoticed
in
many
of
our
residential
country
'ouses
much
of
it
in
peril
i
take
it
of
being
cast
aside
as
so
much
rubbish
what
is
it
shakespeare
says--unconsidered
trifles
ah
i
often
say
he
'as
a
word
for
us
all
sir
i
say
shakespeare
but
i'm
well
aware
all
don't
'old
with
me
there--i
'ad
something
of
an
upset
the
other
day
when
a
gentleman
came
in--a
titled
man
too
he
was
and
i
think
he
told
me
he'd
wrote
on
the
topic
and
i
'appened
to
cite
out
something
about
'ercules
and
the
painted
cloth
dear
me
you
never
see
such
a
pother
but
as
to
this
what
you've
kindly
confided
to
us
it's
a
piece
of
work
we
shall
take
a
reel
enthusiasm
in
achieving
it
out
to
the
very
best
of
our
ability
what
man
'as
done
as
i
was
observing
only
a
few
weeks
back
to
another
esteemed
client
man
can
do
and
in
three
to
four
weeks'
time
all
being
well
we
shall
'ope
to
lay
before
you
evidence
to
that
effect
sir
take
the
address
mr
'iggins
if
you
please
such
was
the
general
drift
of
mr
cattell's
observations
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
interview
with
mr
denton
about
a
month
later
being
advised
that
some
samples
were
ready
for
his
inspection
mr
denton
met
him
again
and
had
it
seems
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
faithfulness
of
the
reproduction
of
the
design
it
had
been
finished
off
at
the
top
in
accordance
with
the
indication
i
mentioned
so
that
the
vertical
bands
joined
but
something
still
needed
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
matching
the
colour
of
the
original
mr
cattell
had
suggestions
of
a
technical
kind
to
offer
with
which
i
need
not
trouble
you
he
had
also
views
as
to
the
general
desirability
of
the
pattern
which
were
vaguely
adverse
you
say
you
don't
wish
this
to
be
supplied
excepting
to
personal
friends
equipped
with
a
authorization
from
yourself
sir
it
shall
be
done
i
quite
understand
your
wish
to
keep
it
exclusive
lends
it
a
catchit
does
it
not
to
the
suite
what's
every
man's
it's
been
said
is
no
man's
do
you
think
it
would
be
popular
if
it
were
generally
obtainable
asked
mr
denton
i
'ardly
think
it
sir
said
cattell
pensively
clasping
his
beard
i
'ardly
think
it
not
popular
it
wasn't
popular
with
the
man
that
cut
the
block
was
it
mr
'iggins
did
he
find
it
a
difficult
job
he'd
no
call
to
do
so
sir
but
the
fact
is
that
the
artistic
temperament--and
our
men
are
artists
sir
every
man
of
them--true
artists
as
much
as
many
that
the
world
styles
by
that
term--it's
apt
to
take
some
strange
'ardly
accountable
likes
or
dislikes
and
here
was
an
example
the
twice
or
thrice
that
i
went
to
inspect
his
progress
language
i
could
understand
for
that's
'abitual
to
him
but
reel
distaste
for
what
i
should
call
a
dainty
enough
thing
i
did
not
nor
am
i
now
able
to
fathom
it
seemed
said
mr
cattell
looking
narrowly
upon
mr
denton
as
if
the
man
scented
something
almost
hevil
in
the
design
indeed
did
he
tell
you
so
i
can't
say
i
see
anything
sinister
in
it
myself
neether
can
i
sir
in
fact
i
said
as
much
'come
gatwick'
i
said
'what's
to
do
here
what's
the
reason
of
your
prejudice--for
i
can
call
it
no
more
than
that'
but
no
no
explanation
was
forthcoming
and
i
was
merely
reduced
as
i
am
now
to
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
a
cui
bono
however
here
it
is
and
with
that
the
technical
side
of
the
question
came
to
the
front
again
the
matching
of
the
colours
for
the
background
the
hem
and
the
knots
of
ribbon
was
by
far
the
longest
part
of
the
business
and
necessitated
many
sendings
to
and
fro
of
the
original
pattern
and
of
new
samples
during
part
of
august
and
september
too
the
dentons
were
away
from
the
manor
so
that
it
was
not
until
october
was
well
in
that
a
sufficient
quantity
of
the
stuff
had
been
manufactured
to
furnish
curtains
for
the
three
or
four
bedrooms
which
were
to
be
fitted
up
with
it
on
the
feast
of
simon
and
jude
the
aunt
and
nephew
returned
from
a
short
visit
to
find
all
completed
and
their
satisfaction
at
the
general
effect
was
great
the
new
curtains
in
particular
agreed
to
admiration
with
their
surroundings
when
mr
denton
was
dressing
for
dinner
and
took
stock
of
his
room
in
which
there
was
a
large
amount
of
the
chintz
displayed
he
congratulated
himself
over
and
over
again
on
the
luck
which
had
first
made
him
forget
his
aunt's
commission
and
had
then
put
into
his
hands
this
extremely
effective
means
of
remedying
his
mistake
the
pattern
was
as
he
said
at
dinner
so
restful
and
yet
so
far
from
being
dull
and
miss
denton--who
by
the
way
had
none
of
the
stuff
in
her
own
room--was
much
disposed
to
agree
with
him
at
breakfast
next
morning
he
was
induced
to
qualify
his
satisfaction
to
some
extent--but
very
slightly
there
is
one
thing
i
rather
regret
he
said
that
we
allowed
them
to
join
up
the
vertical
bands
of
the
pattern
at
the
top
i
think
it
would
have
been
better
to
leave
that
alone
oh
said
his
aunt
interrogatively
yes
as
i
was
reading
in
bed
last
night
they
kept
catching
my
eye
rather
that
is
i
found
myself
looking
across
at
them
every
now
and
then
there
was
an
effect
as
if
some
one
kept
peeping
out
between
the
curtains
in
one
place
or
another
where
there
was
no
edge
and
i
think
that
was
due
to
the
joining
up
of
the
bands
at
the
top
the
only
other
thing
that
troubled
me
was
the
wind
why
i
thought
it
was
a
perfectly
still
night
perhaps
it
was
only
on
my
side
of
the
house
but
there
was
enough
to
sway
my
curtains
and
rustle
them
more
than
i
wanted
that
night
a
bachelor
friend
of
james
denton's
came
to
stay
and
was
lodged
in
a
room
on
the
same
floor
as
his
host
but
at
the
end
of
a
long
passage
halfway
down
which
was
a
red
baize
door
put
there
to
cut
off
the
draught
and
intercept
noise
the
party
of
three
had
separated
miss
denton
a
good
first
the
two
men
at
about
eleven
james
denton
not
yet
inclined
for
bed
sat
him
down
in
an
arm-chair
and
read
for
a
time
then
he
dozed
and
then
he
woke
and
bethought
himself
that
his
brown
spaniel
which
ordinarily
slept
in
his
room
had
not
come
upstairs
with
him
then
he
thought
he
was
mistaken
for
happening
to
move
his
hand
which
hung
down
over
the
arm
of
the
chair
within
a
few
inches
of
the
floor
he
felt
on
the
back
of
it
just
the
slightest
touch
of
a
surface
of
hair
and
stretching
it
out
in
that
direction
he
stroked
and
patted
a
rounded
something
but
the
feel
of
it
and
still
more
the
fact
that
instead
of
a
responsive
movement
absolute
stillness
greeted
his
touch
made
him
look
over
the
arm
what
he
had
been
touching
rose
to
meet
him
it
was
in
the
attitude
of
one
that
had
crept
along
the
floor
on
its
belly
and
it
was
so
far
as
could
be
collected
a
human
figure
but
of
the
face
which
was
now
rising
to
within
a
few
inches
of
his
own
no
feature
was
discernible
only
hair
shapeless
as
it
was
there
was
about
it
so
horrible
an
air
of
menace
that
as
he
bounded
from
his
chair
and
rushed
from
the
room
he
heard
himself
moaning
with
fear
and
doubtless
he
did
right
to
fly
as
he
dashed
into
the
baize
door
that
cut
the
passage
in
two
and--forgetting
that
it
opened
towards
him--beat
against
it
with
all
the
force
in
him
he
felt
a
soft
ineffectual
tearing
at
his
back
which
all
the
same
seemed
to
be
growing
in
power
as
if
the
hand
or
whatever
worse
than
a
hand
was
there
were
becoming
more
material
as
the
pursuer's
rage
was
more
concentrated
then
he
remembered
the
trick
of
the
door--he
got
it
open--he
shut
it
behind
him--he
gained
his
friend's
room
and
that
is
all
we
need
know
it
seems
curious
that
during
all
the
time
that
had
elapsed
since
the
purchase
of
poynter's
diary
james
denton
should
not
have
sought
an
explanation
of
the
presence
of
the
pattern
that
had
been
pinned
into
it
well
he
had
read
the
diary
through
without
finding
it
mentioned
and
had
concluded
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
but
on
leaving
rendcomb
manor
he
did
not
know
whether
for
good
as
he
naturally
insisted
upon
doing
on
the
day
after
experiencing
the
horror
i
have
tried
to
put
into
words
he
took
the
diary
with
him
and
at
his
seaside
lodgings
he
examined
more
narrowly
the
portion
whence
the
pattern
had
been
taken
what
he
remembered
having
suspected
about
it
turned
out
to
be
correct
two
or
three
leaves
were
pasted
together
but
written
upon
as
was
patent
when
they
were
held
up
to
the
light
they
yielded
easily
to
steaming
for
the
paste
had
lost
much
of
its
strength
and
they
contained
something
relevant
to
the
pattern
the
entry
was
made
in
1707
old
mr
casbury
of
acrington
told
me
this
day
much
of
young
sir
everard
charlett
whom
he
remember'd
commoner
of
university
college
and
thought
was
of
the
same
family
as
dr
arthur
charlett
now
master
of
ye
coll
this
charlett
was
a
personable
young
gent
but
a
loose
atheistical
companion
and
a
great
lifter
as
they
then
call'd
the
hard
drinkers
and
for
what
i
know
do
so
now
he
was
noted
and
subject
to
severall
censures
at
different
times
for
his
extravagancies
and
if
the
full
history
of
his
debaucheries
had
bin
known
no
doubt
would
have
been
expell'd
ye
coll
supposing
that
no
interest
had
been
imploy'd
on
his
behalf
of
which
mr
casbury
had
some
suspicion
he
was
a
very
beautiful
person
and
constantly
wore
his
own
hair
which
was
very
abundant
from
which
and
his
loose
way
of
living
the
cant
name
for
him
was
absalom
and
he
was
accustom'd
to
say
that
indeed
he
believ'd
he
had
shortened
old
david's
days
meaning
his
father
sir
job
charlett
an
old
worthy
cavalier
note
that
mr
casbury
said
that
he
remembers
not
the
year
of
sir
everard
charlett's
death
but
it
was
1692
or
3
he
died
suddenly
in
october
several
lines
describing
his
unpleasant
habits
and
reputed
delinquencies
are
omitted
having
seen
him
in
such
topping
spirits
the
night
before
mr
casbury
was
amaz'd
when
he
learn'd
the
death
he
was
found
in
the
town
ditch
the
hair
as
was
said
pluck'd
clean
off
his
head
most
bells
in
oxford
rung
out
for
him
being
a
nobleman
and
he
was
buried
next
night
in
st
peter's
in
the
east
but
two
years
after
being
to
be
moved
to
his
country
estate
by
his
successor
it
was
said
the
coffin
breaking
by
mischance
proved
quite
full
of
hair
which
sounds
fabulous
but
yet
i
believe
precedents
are
upon
record
as
in
dr
plot's
history
of
staffordshire
his
chambers
being
afterwards
stripp'd
mr
casbury
came
by
part
of
the
hangings
of
it
which
'twas
said
this
charlett
had
design'd
expressly
for
a
memorial
of
his
hair
giving
the
fellow
that
drew
it
a
lock
to
work
by
and
the
piece
which
i
have
fasten'd
in
here
was
parcel
of
the
same
which
mr
casbury
gave
to
me
he
said
he
believ'd
there
was
a
subtlety
in
the
drawing
but
had
never
discover'd
it
himself
nor
much
liked
to
pore
upon
it





the
money
spent
upon
the
curtains
might
as
well
have
been
thrown
into
the
fire
as
they
were
mr
cattell's
comment
upon
what
he
heard
of
the
story
took
the
form
of
a
quotation
from
shakespeare
you
may
guess
it
without
difficulty
it
began
with
the
words
there
are
more
things
an
episode
of
cathedral
history
an
episode
of
cathedral
history
there
was
once
a
learned
gentleman
who
was
deputed
to
examine
and
report
upon
the
archives
of
the
cathedral
of
southminster
the
examination
of
these
records
demanded
a
very
considerable
expenditure
of
time
hence
it
became
advisable
for
him
to
engage
lodgings
in
the
city
for
though
the
cathedral
body
were
profuse
in
their
offers
of
hospitality
mr
lake
felt
that
he
would
prefer
to
be
master
of
his
day
this
was
recognized
as
reasonable
the
dean
eventually
wrote
advising
mr
lake
if
he
were
not
already
suited
to
communicate
with
mr
worby
the
principal
verger
who
occupied
a
house
convenient
to
the
church
and
was
prepared
to
take
in
a
quiet
lodger
for
three
or
four
weeks
such
an
arrangement
was
precisely
what
mr
lake
desired
terms
were
easily
agreed
upon
and
early
in
december
like
another
mr
datchery
as
he
remarked
to
himself
the
investigator
found
himself
in
the
occupation
of
a
very
comfortable
room
in
an
ancient
and
cathedraly
house
one
so
familiar
with
the
customs
of
cathedral
churches
and
treated
with
such
obvious
consideration
by
the
dean
and
chapter
of
this
cathedral
in
particular
could
not
fail
to
command
the
respect
of
the
head
verger
mr
worby
even
acquiesced
in
certain
modifications
of
statements
he
had
been
accustomed
to
offer
for
years
to
parties
of
visitors
mr
lake
on
his
part
found
the
verger
a
very
cheery
companion
and
took
advantage
of
any
occasion
that
presented
itself
for
enjoying
his
conversation
when
the
day's
work
was
over
one
evening
about
nine
o'clock
mr
worby
knocked
at
his
lodger's
door
i've
occasion
he
said
to
go
across
to
the
cathedral
mr
lake
and
i
think
i
made
you
a
promise
when
i
did
so
next
i
would
give
you
the
opportunity
to
see
what
it
looks
like
at
night
time
it
is
quite
fine
and
dry
outside
if
you
care
to
come
to
be
sure
i
will
very
much
obliged
to
you
mr
worby
for
thinking
of
it
but
let
me
get
my
coat
here
it
is
sir
and
i've
another
lantern
here
that
you'll
find
advisable
for
the
steps
as
there's
no
moon
any
one
might
think
we
were
jasper
and
durdles
over
again
mightn't
they
said
lake
as
they
crossed
the
close
for
he
had
ascertained
that
the
verger
had
read
edwin
drood
well
so
they
might
said
mr
worby
with
a
short
laugh
though
i
don't
know
whether
we
ought
to
take
it
as
a
compliment
odd
ways
i
often
think
they
had
at
that
cathedral
don't
it
seem
so
to
you
sir
full
choral
matins
at
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
all
the
year
round
wouldn't
suit
our
boys'
voices
nowadays
and
i
think
there's
one
or
two
of
the
men
would
be
applying
for
a
rise
if
the
chapter
was
to
bring
it
in--particular
the
alltoes
they
were
now
at
the
south-west
door
as
mr
worby
was
unlocking
it
lake
said
did
you
ever
find
anybody
locked
in
here
by
accident
twice
i
did
one
was
a
drunk
sailor
however
he
got
in
i
don't
know
i
s'pose
he
went
to
sleep
in
the
service
but
by
the
time
i
got
to
him
he
was
praying
fit
to
bring
the
roof
in
lor'
what
a
noise
that
man
did
make
said
it
was
the
first
time
he'd
been
inside
a
church
for
ten
years
and
blest
if
ever
he'd
try
it
again
the
other
was
an
old
sheep
them
boys
it
was
up
to
their
games
that
was
the
last
time
they
tried
it
on
though
there
sir
now
you
see
what
we
look
like
our
late
dean
used
now
and
again
to
bring
parties
in
but
he
preferred
a
moonlight
night
and
there
was
a
piece
of
verse
he'd
coat
to
'em
relating
to
a
scotch
cathedral
i
understand
but
i
don't
know
i
almost
think
the
effect's
better
when
it's
all
dark-like
seems
to
add
to
the
size
and
heighth
now
if
you
won't
mind
stopping
somewhere
in
the
nave
while
i
go
up
into
the
choir
where
my
business
lays
you'll
see
what
i
mean
accordingly
lake
waited
leaning
against
a
pillar
and
watched
the
light
wavering
along
the
length
of
the
church
and
up
the
steps
into
the
choir
until
it
was
intercepted
by
some
screen
or
other
furniture
which
only
allowed
the
reflection
to
be
seen
on
the
piers
and
roof
not
many
minutes
had
passed
before
worby
reappeared
at
the
door
of
the
choir
and
by
waving
his
lantern
signalled
to
lake
to
rejoin
him
i
suppose
it
is
worby
and
not
a
substitute
thought
lake
to
himself
as
he
walked
up
the
nave
there
was
in
fact
nothing
untoward
worby
showed
him
the
papers
which
he
had
come
to
fetch
out
of
the
dean's
stall
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
the
spectacle
lake
agreed
that
it
was
well
worth
seeing
i
suppose
he
said
as
they
walked
towards
the
altar-steps
together
that
you're
too
much
used
to
going
about
here
at
night
to
feel
nervous--but
you
must
get
a
start
every
now
and
then
don't
you
when
a
book
falls
down
or
a
door
swings
to
no
mr
lake
i
can't
say
i
think
much
about
noises
not
nowadays
i'm
much
more
afraid
of
finding
an
escape
of
gas
or
a
burst
in
the
stove
pipes
than
anything
else
still
there
have
been
times
years
ago
did
you
notice
that
plain
altar-tomb
there--fifteenth
century
we
say
it
is
i
don't
know
if
you
agree
to
that
well
if
you
didn't
look
at
it
just
come
back
and
give
it
a
glance
if
you'd
be
so
good
it
was
on
the
north
side
of
the
choir
and
rather
awkwardly
placed
only
about
three
feet
from
the
enclosing
stone
screen
quite
plain
as
the
verger
had
said
but
for
some
ordinary
stone
panelling
a
metal
cross
of
some
size
on
the
northern
side
that
next
to
the
screen
was
the
solitary
feature
of
any
interest
lake
agreed
that
it
was
not
earlier
than
the
perpendicular
period
but
he
said
unless
it's
the
tomb
of
some
remarkable
person
you'll
forgive
me
for
saying
that
i
don't
think
it's
particularly
noteworthy
well
i
can't
say
as
it
is
the
tomb
of
anybody
noted
in
'istory
said
worby
who
had
a
dry
smile
on
his
face
for
we
don't
own
any
record
whatsoever
of
who
it
was
put
up
to
for
all
that
if
you've
half
an
hour
to
spare
sir
when
we
get
back
to
the
house
mr
lake
i
could
tell
you
a
tale
about
that
tomb
i
won't
begin
on
it
now
it
strikes
cold
here
and
we
don't
want
to
be
dawdling
about
all
night
of
course
i
should
like
to
hear
it
immensely
very
well
sir
you
shall
now
if
i
might
put
a
question
to
you
he
went
on
as
they
passed
down
the
choir
aisle
in
our
little
local
guide--and
not
only
there
but
in
the
little
book
on
our
cathedral
in
the
series--you'll
find
it
stated
that
this
portion
of
the
building
was
erected
previous
to
the
twelfth
century
now
of
course
i
should
be
glad
enough
to
take
that
view
but--mind
the
step
sir--but
i
put
it
to
you--does
the
lay
of
the
stone
'ere
in
this
portion
of
the
wall
which
he
tapped
with
his
key
does
it
to
your
eye
carry
the
flavour
of
what
you
might
call
saxon
masonry
no
i
thought
not
no
more
it
does
to
me
now
if
you'll
believe
me
i've
said
as
much
to
those
men--one's
the
librarian
of
our
free
libry
here
and
the
other
came
down
from
london
on
purpose--fifty
times
if
i
have
once
but
i
might
just
as
well
have
talked
to
that
bit
of
stonework
but
there
it
is
i
suppose
every
one's
got
their
opinions
the
discussion
of
this
peculiar
trait
of
human
nature
occupied
mr
worby
almost
up
to
the
moment
when
he
and
lake
re-entered
the
former's
house
the
condition
of
the
fire
in
lake's
sitting-room
led
to
a
suggestion
from
mr
worby
that
they
should
finish
the
evening
in
his
own
parlour
we
find
them
accordingly
settled
there
some
short
time
afterwards
mr
worby
made
his
story
a
long
one
and
i
will
not
undertake
to
tell
it
wholly
in
his
own
words
or
in
his
own
order
lake
committed
the
substance
of
it
to
paper
immediately
after
hearing
it
together
with
some
few
passages
of
the
narrative
which
had
fixed
themselves
verbatim
in
his
mind
i
shall
probably
find
it
expedient
to
condense
lake's
record
to
some
extent
mr
worby
was
born
it
appeared
about
the
year
1828
his
father
before
him
had
been
connected
with
the
cathedral
and
likewise
his
grandfather
one
or
both
had
been
choristers
and
in
later
life
both
had
done
work
as
mason
and
carpenter
respectively
about
the
fabric
worby
himself
though
possessed
as
he
frankly
acknowledged
of
an
indifferent
voice
had
been
drafted
into
the
choir
at
about
ten
years
of
age
it
was
in
1840
that
the
wave
of
the
gothic
revival
smote
the
cathedral
of
southminster
there
was
a
lot
of
lovely
stuff
went
then
sir
said
worby
with
a
sigh
my
father
couldn't
hardly
believe
it
when
he
got
his
orders
to
clear
out
the
choir
there
was
a
new
dean
just
come
in--dean
burscough
it
was--and
my
father
had
been
'prenticed
to
a
good
firm
of
joiners
in
the
city
and
knew
what
good
work
was
when
he
saw
it
crool
it
was
he
used
to
say
all
that
beautiful
wainscot
oak
as
good
as
the
day
it
was
put
up
and
garlands-like
of
foliage
and
fruit
and
lovely
old
gilding
work
on
the
coats
of
arms
and
the
organ
pipes
all
went
to
the
timber
yard--every
bit
except
some
little
pieces
worked
up
in
the
lady
chapel
and
'ere
in
this
overmantel
well--i
may
be
mistook
but
i
say
our
choir
never
looked
as
well
since
still
there
was
a
lot
found
out
about
the
history
of
the
church
and
no
doubt
but
what
it
did
stand
in
need
of
repair
there
were
very
few
winters
passed
but
what
we'd
lose
a
pinnicle
mr
lake
expressed
his
concurrence
with
worby's
views
of
restoration
but
owns
to
a
fear
about
this
point
lest
the
story
proper
should
never
be
reached
possibly
this
was
perceptible
in
his
manner
worby
hastened
to
reassure
him
not
but
what
i
could
carry
on
about
that
topic
for
hours
at
a
time
and
do
do
when
i
see
my
opportunity
but
dean
burscough
he
was
very
set
on
the
gothic
period
and
nothing
would
serve
him
but
everything
must
be
made
agreeable
to
that
and
one
morning
after
service
he
appointed
for
my
father
to
meet
him
in
the
choir
and
he
came
back
after
he'd
taken
off
his
robes
in
the
vestry
and
he'd
got
a
roll
of
paper
with
him
and
the
verger
that
was
then
brought
in
a
table
and
they
begun
spreading
it
out
on
the
table
with
prayer
books
to
keep
it
down
and
my
father
helped
'em
and
he
saw
it
was
a
picture
of
the
inside
of
a
choir
in
a
cathedral
and
the
dean--he
was
a
quick
spoken
gentleman--he
says
'well
worby
what
do
you
think
of
that'
'why'
says
my
father
'i
don't
think
i
'ave
the
pleasure
of
knowing
that
view
would
that
be
hereford
cathedral
mr
dean'
'no
worby'
says
the
dean
'that's
southminster
cathedral
as
we
hope
to
see
it
before
many
years'
'in-deed
sir'
says
my
father
and
that
was
all
he
did
say--leastways
to
the
dean--but
he
used
to
tell
me
he
felt
really
faint
in
himself
when
he
looked
round
our
choir
as
i
can
remember
it
all
comfortable
and
furnished-like
and
then
see
this
nasty
little
dry
picter
as
he
called
it
drawn
out
by
some
london
architect
well
there
i
am
again
but
you'll
see
what
i
mean
if
you
look
at
this
old
view
worby
reached
down
a
framed
print
from
the
wall
well
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
was
that
the
dean
he
handed
over
to
my
father
a
copy
of
an
order
of
the
chapter
that
he
was
to
clear
out
every
bit
of
the
choir--make
a
clean
sweep--ready
for
the
new
work
that
was
being
designed
up
in
town
and
he
was
to
put
it
in
hand
as
soon
as
ever
he
could
get
the
breakers
together
now
then
sir
if
you
look
at
that
view
you'll
see
where
the
pulpit
used
to
stand
that's
what
i
want
you
to
notice
if
you
please
it
was
indeed
easily
seen
an
unusually
large
structure
of
timber
with
a
domed
sounding-board
standing
at
the
east
end
of
the
stalls
on
the
north
side
of
the
choir
facing
the
bishop's
throne
worby
proceeded
to
explain
that
during
the
alterations
services
were
held
in
the
nave
the
members
of
the
choir
being
thereby
disappointed
of
an
anticipated
holiday
and
the
organist
in
particular
incurring
the
suspicion
of
having
wilfully
damaged
the
mechanism
of
the
temporary
organ
that
was
hired
at
considerable
expense
from
london
the
work
of
demolition
began
with
the
choir
screen
and
organ
loft
and
proceeded
gradually
eastwards
disclosing
as
worby
said
many
interesting
features
of
older
work
while
this
was
going
on
the
members
of
the
chapter
were
naturally
in
and
about
the
choir
a
great
deal
and
it
soon
became
apparent
to
the
elder
worby--who
could
not
help
overhearing
some
of
their
talk--that
on
the
part
of
the
senior
canons
especially
there
must
have
been
a
good
deal
of
disagreement
before
the
policy
now
being
carried
out
had
been
adopted
some
were
of
opinion
that
they
should
catch
their
deaths
of
cold
in
the
return-stalls
unprotected
by
a
screen
from
the
draughts
in
the
nave
others
objected
to
being
exposed
to
the
view
of
persons
in
the
choir
aisles
especially
they
said
during
the
sermons
when
they
found
it
helpful
to
listen
in
a
posture
which
was
liable
to
misconstruction
the
strongest
opposition
however
came
from
the
oldest
of
the
body
who
up
to
the
last
moment
objected
to
the
removal
of
the
pulpit
you
ought
not
to
touch
it
mr
dean
he
said
with
great
emphasis
one
morning
when
the
two
were
standing
before
it
you
don't
know
what
mischief
you
may
do
mischief
it's
not
a
work
of
any
particular
merit
canon
don't
call
me
canon
said
the
old
man
with
great
asperity
that
is
for
thirty
years
i've
been
known
as
dr
ayloff
and
i
shall
be
obliged
mr
dean
if
you
would
kindly
humour
me
in
that
matter
and
as
to
the
pulpit
which
i've
preached
from
for
thirty
years
though
i
don't
insist
on
that
all
i'll
say
is
i
know
you're
doing
wrong
in
moving
it
but
what
sense
could
there
be
my
dear
doctor
in
leaving
it
where
it
is
when
we're
fitting
up
the
rest
of
the
choir
in
a
totally
different
style
what
reason
could
be
given--apart
from
the
look
of
the
thing
reason
reason
said
old
dr
ayloff
if
you
young
men--if
i
may
say
so
without
any
disrespect
mr
dean--if
you'd
only
listen
to
reason
a
little
and
not
be
always
asking
for
it
we
should
get
on
better
but
there
i've
said
my
say
the
old
gentleman
hobbled
off
and
as
it
proved
never
entered
the
cathedral
again
the
season--it
was
a
hot
summer--turned
sickly
on
a
sudden
dr
ayloff
was
one
of
the
first
to
go
with
some
affection
of
the
muscles
of
the
thorax
which
took
him
painfully
at
night
and
at
many
services
the
number
of
choirmen
and
boys
was
very
thin
meanwhile
the
pulpit
had
been
done
away
with
in
fact
the
sounding-board
part
of
which
still
exists
as
a
table
in
a
summer-house
in
the
palace
garden
was
taken
down
within
an
hour
or
two
of
dr
ayloff's
protest
the
removal
of
the
base--not
effected
without
considerable
trouble--disclosed
to
view
greatly
to
the
exultation
of
the
restoring
party
an
altar-tomb--the
tomb
of
course
to
which
worby
had
attracted
lake's
attention
that
same
evening
much
fruitless
research
was
expended
in
attempts
to
identify
the
occupant
from
that
day
to
this
he
has
never
had
a
name
put
to
him
the
structure
had
been
most
carefully
boxed
in
under
the
pulpit-base
so
that
such
slight
ornament
as
it
possessed
was
not
defaced
only
on
the
north
side
of
it
there
was
what
looked
like
an
injury
a
gap
between
two
of
the
slabs
composing
the
side
it
might
be
two
or
three
inches
across
palmer
the
mason
was
directed
to
fill
it
up
in
a
week's
time
when
he
came
to
do
some
other
small
jobs
near
that
part
of
the
choir
the
season
was
undoubtedly
a
very
trying
one
whether
the
church
was
built
on
a
site
that
had
once
been
a
marsh
as
was
suggested
or
for
whatever
reason
the
residents
in
its
immediate
neighbourhood
had
many
of
them
but
little
enjoyment
of
the
exquisite
sunny
days
and
the
calm
nights
of
august
and
september
to
several
of
the
older
people--dr
ayloff
among
others
as
we
have
seen--the
summer
proved
downright
fatal
but
even
among
the
younger
few
escaped
either
a
sojourn
in
bed
for
a
matter
of
weeks
or
at
the
least
a
brooding
sense
of
oppression
accompanied
by
hateful
nightmares
gradually
there
formulated
itself
a
suspicion--which
grew
into
a
conviction--that
the
alterations
in
the
cathedral
had
something
to
say
in
the
matter
the
widow
of
a
former
old
verger
a
pensioner
of
the
chapter
of
southminster
was
visited
by
dreams
which
she
retailed
to
her
friends
of
a
shape
that
slipped
out
of
the
little
door
of
the
south
transept
as
the
dark
fell
in
and
flitted--taking
a
fresh
direction
every
night--about
the
close
disappearing
for
a
while
in
house
after
house
and
finally
emerging
again
when
the
night
sky
was
paling
she
could
see
nothing
of
it
she
said
but
that
it
was
a
moving
form
only
she
had
an
impression
that
when
it
returned
to
the
church
as
it
seemed
to
do
in
the
end
of
the
dream
it
turned
its
head
and
then
she
could
not
tell
why
but
she
thought
it
had
red
eyes
worby
remembered
hearing
the
old
lady
tell
this
dream
at
a
tea-party
in
the
house
of
the
chapter
clerk
its
recurrence
might
perhaps
he
said
be
taken
as
a
symptom
of
approaching
illness
at
any
rate
before
the
end
of
september
the
old
lady
was
in
her
grave
the
interest
excited
by
the
restoration
of
this
great
church
was
not
confined
to
its
own
county
one
day
that
summer
an
fsa
of
some
celebrity
visited
the
place
his
business
was
to
write
an
account
of
the
discoveries
that
had
been
made
for
the
society
of
antiquaries
and
his
wife
who
accompanied
him
was
to
make
a
series
of
illustrative
drawings
for
his
report
in
the
morning
she
employed
herself
in
making
a
general
sketch
of
the
choir
in
the
afternoon
she
devoted
herself
to
details
she
first
drew
the
newly
exposed
altar-tomb
and
when
that
was
finished
she
called
her
husband's
attention
to
a
beautiful
piece
of
diaper-ornament
on
the
screen
just
behind
it
which
had
like
the
tomb
itself
been
completely
concealed
by
the
pulpit
of
course
he
said
an
illustration
of
that
must
be
made
so
she
seated
herself
on
the
tomb
and
began
a
careful
drawing
which
occupied
her
till
dusk
her
husband
had
by
this
time
finished
his
work
of
measuring
and
description
and
they
agreed
that
it
was
time
to
be
getting
back
to
their
hotel
you
may
as
well
brush
my
skirt
frank
said
the
lady
it
must
have
got
covered
with
dust
i'm
sure
he
obeyed
dutifully
but
after
a
moment
he
said
i
don't
know
whether
you
value
this
dress
particularly
my
dear
but
i'm
inclined
to
think
it's
seen
its
best
days
there's
a
great
bit
of
it
gone
gone
where
said
she
i
don't
know
where
it's
gone
but
it's
off
at
the
bottom
edge
behind
here
she
pulled
it
hastily
into
sight
and
was
horrified
to
find
a
jagged
tear
extending
some
way
into
the
substance
of
the
stuff
very
much
she
said
as
if
a
dog
had
rent
it
away
the
dress
was
in
any
case
hopelessly
spoilt
to
her
great
vexation
and
though
they
looked
everywhere
the
missing
piece
could
not
be
found
there
were
many
ways
they
concluded
in
which
the
injury
might
have
come
about
for
the
choir
was
full
of
old
bits
of
woodwork
with
nails
sticking
out
of
them
finally
they
could
only
suppose
that
one
of
these
had
caused
the
mischief
and
that
the
workmen
who
had
been
about
all
day
had
carried
off
the
particular
piece
with
the
fragment
of
dress
still
attached
to
it
it
was
about
this
time
worby
thought
that
his
little
dog
began
to
wear
an
anxious
expression
when
the
hour
for
it
to
be
put
into
the
shed
in
the
back
yard
approached
for
his
mother
had
ordained
that
it
must
not
sleep
in
the
house
one
evening
he
said
when
he
was
just
going
to
pick
it
up
and
carry
it
out
it
looked
at
him
like
a
christian
and
waved
its
'and
i
was
going
to
say--well
you
know
'ow
they
do
carry
on
sometimes
and
the
end
of
it
was
i
put
it
under
my
coat
and
'uddled
it
upstairs--and
i'm
afraid
i
as
good
as
deceived
my
poor
mother
on
the
subject
after
that
the
dog
acted
very
artful
with
'iding
itself
under
the
bed
for
half-an-hour
or
more
before
bed-time
came
and
we
worked
it
so
as
my
mother
never
found
out
what
we'd
done
of
course
worby
was
glad
of
its
company
anyhow
but
more
particularly
when
the
nuisance
that
is
still
remembered
in
southminster
as
the
crying
set
in
night
after
night
said
worby
that
dog
seemed
to
know
it
was
coming
he'd
creep
out
he
would
and
snuggle
into
the
bed
and
cuddle
right
up
to
me
shivering
and
when
the
crying
come
he'd
be
like
a
wild
thing
shoving
his
head
under
my
arm
and
i
was
fully
near
as
bad
six
or
seven
times
we'd
hear
it
not
more
and
when
he'd
dror
out
his
'ed
again
i'd
know
it
was
over
for
that
night
what
was
it
like
sir
well
i
never
heard
but
one
thing
that
seemed
to
hit
it
off
i
happened
to
be
playing
about
in
the
close
and
there
was
two
of
the
canons
met
and
said
'good
morning'
one
to
another
'sleep
well
last
night'
says
one--it
was
mr
henslow
that
one
and
mr
lyall
was
the
other--'can't
say
i
did'
says
mr
lyall
'rather
too
much
of
isaiah
34
14
for
me'
'34
14'
says
mr
henslow
'what's
that'
'you
call
yourself
a
bible
reader'
says
mr
lyall
mr
henslow
you
must
know
he
was
one
of
what
used
to
be
termed
simeon's
lot--pretty
much
what
we
should
call
the
evangelical
party
'you
go
and
look
it
up'
i
wanted
to
know
what
he
was
getting
at
myself
and
so
off
i
ran
home
and
got
out
my
own
bible
and
there
it
was
'the
satyr
shall
cry
to
his
fellow'
well
i
thought
is
that
what
we've
been
listening
to
these
past
nights
and
i
tell
you
it
made
me
look
over
my
shoulder
a
time
or
two
of
course
i'd
asked
my
father
and
mother
about
what
it
could
be
before
that
but
they
both
said
it
was
most
likely
cats
but
they
spoke
very
short
and
i
could
see
they
was
troubled
my
word
that
was
a
noise--'ungry-like
as
if
it
was
calling
after
some
one
that
wouldn't
come
if
ever
you
felt
you
wanted
company
it
would
be
when
you
was
waiting
for
it
to
begin
again
i
believe
two
or
three
nights
there
was
men
put
on
to
watch
in
different
parts
of
the
close
but
they
all
used
to
get
together
in
one
corner
the
nearest
they
could
to
the
high
street
and
nothing
came
of
it
well
the
next
thing
was
this
me
and
another
of
the
boys--he's
in
business
in
the
city
now
as
a
grocer
like
his
father
before
him--we'd
gone
up
in
the
close
after
morning
service
was
over
and
we
heard
old
palmer
the
mason
bellowing
to
some
of
his
men
so
we
went
up
nearer
because
we
knew
he
was
a
rusty
old
chap
and
there
might
be
some
fun
going
it
appears
palmer'd
told
this
man
to
stop
up
the
chink
in
that
old
tomb
well
there
was
this
man
keeping
on
saying
he'd
done
it
the
best
he
could
and
there
was
palmer
carrying
on
like
all
possessed
about
it
'call
that
making
a
job
of
it'
he
says
'if
you
had
your
rights
you'd
get
the
sack
for
this
what
do
you
suppose
i
pay
you
your
wages
for
what
do
you
suppose
i'm
going
to
say
to
the
dean
and
chapter
when
they
come
round
as
come
they
may
do
any
time
and
see
where
you've
been
bungling
about
covering
the
'ole
place
with
mess
and
plaster
and
lord
knows
what'
'well
master
i
done
the
best
i
could'
says
the
man
'i
don't
know
no
more
than
what
you
do
'ow
it
come
to
fall
out
this
way
i
tamped
it
right
in
the
'ole'
he
says
'and
now
it's
fell
out'
he
says
'i
never
see'
'fell
out'
says
old
palmer
'why
it's
nowhere
near
the
place
blowed
out
you
mean'
and
he
picked
up
a
bit
of
plaster
and
so
did
i
that
was
laying
up
against
the
screen
three
or
four
feet
off
and
not
dry
yet
and
old
palmer
he
looked
at
it
curious-like
and
then
he
turned
round
on
me
and
he
says
'now
then
you
boys
have
you
been
up
to
some
of
your
games
here'
'no'
i
says
'i
haven't
mr
palmer
there's
none
of
us
been
about
here
till
just
this
minute'
and
while
i
was
talking
the
other
boy
evans
he
got
looking
in
through
the
chink
and
i
heard
him
draw
in
his
breath
and
he
came
away
sharp
and
up
to
us
and
says
he
'i
believe
there's
something
in
there
i
saw
something
shiny'
'what
i
daresay'
says
old
palmer
'well
i
ain't
got
time
to
stop
about
there
you
william
you
go
off
and
get
some
more
stuff
and
make
a
job
of
it
this
time
if
not
there'll
be
trouble
in
my
yard'
he
says
so
the
man
he
went
off
and
palmer
too
and
us
boys
stopped
behind
and
i
says
to
evans
'did
you
really
see
anything
in
there'
'yes'
he
says
'i
did
indeed'
so
then
i
says
'let's
shove
something
in
and
stir
it
up'
and
we
tried
several
of
the
bits
of
wood
that
was
laying
about
but
they
were
all
too
big
then
evans
he
had
a
sheet
of
music
he'd
brought
with
him
an
anthem
or
a
service
i
forget
which
it
was
now
and
he
rolled
it
up
small
and
shoved
it
in
the
chink
two
or
three
times
he
did
it
and
nothing
happened
'give
it
me
boy'
i
said
and
i
had
a
try
no
nothing
happened
then
i
don't
know
why
i
thought
of
it
i'm
sure
but
i
stooped
down
just
opposite
the
chink
and
put
my
two
fingers
in
my
mouth
and
whistled--you
know
the
way--and
at
that
i
seemed
to
think
i
heard
something
stirring
and
i
says
to
evans
'come
away'
i
says
'i
don't
like
this'
'oh
rot'
he
says
'give
me
that
roll'
and
he
took
it
and
shoved
it
in
and
i
don't
think
ever
i
see
any
one
go
so
pale
as
he
did
'i
say
worby'
he
says
'it's
caught
or
else
some
one's
got
hold
of
it'
'pull
it
out
or
leave
it'
i
says
'come
and
let's
get
off'
so
he
gave
a
good
pull
and
it
came
away
leastways
most
of
it
did
but
the
end
was
gone
torn
off
it
was
and
evans
looked
at
it
for
a
second
and
then
he
gave
a
sort
of
a
croak
and
let
it
drop
and
we
both
made
off
out
of
there
as
quick
as
ever
we
could
when
we
got
outside
evans
says
to
me
'did
you
see
the
end
of
that
paper'
'no'
i
says
'only
it
was
torn'
'yes
it
was'
he
says
'but
it
was
wet
too
and
black'
well
partly
because
of
the
fright
we
had
and
partly
because
that
music
was
wanted
in
a
day
or
two
and
we
knew
there'd
be
a
set-out
about
it
with
the
organist
we
didn't
say
nothing
to
any
one
else
and
i
suppose
the
workmen
they
swept
up
the
bit
that
was
left
along
with
the
rest
of
the
rubbish
but
evans
if
you
were
to
ask
him
this
very
day
about
it
he'd
stick
to
it
he
saw
that
paper
wet
and
black
at
the
end
where
it
was
torn
after
that
the
boys
gave
the
choir
a
wide
berth
so
that
worby
was
not
sure
what
was
the
result
of
the
mason's
renewed
mending
of
the
tomb
only
he
made
out
from
fragments
of
conversation
dropped
by
the
workmen
passing
through
the
choir
that
some
difficulty
had
been
met
with
and
that
the
governor--mr
palmer
to
wit--had
tried
his
own
hand
at
the
job
a
little
later
he
happened
to
see
mr
palmer
himself
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
deanery
and
being
admitted
by
the
butler
a
day
or
so
after
that
he
gathered
from
a
remark
his
father
let
fall
at
breakfast
that
something
a
little
out
of
the
common
was
to
be
done
in
the
cathedral
after
morning
service
on
the
morrow
and
i'd
just
as
soon
it
was
to-day
his
father
added
i
don't
see
the
use
of
running
risks
'father'
i
says
'what
are
you
going
to
do
in
the
cathedral
to-morrow'
and
he
turned
on
me
as
savage
as
i
ever
see
him--he
was
a
wonderful
good-tempered
man
as
a
general
thing
my
poor
father
was
'my
lad'
he
says
'i'll
trouble
you
not
to
go
picking
up
your
elders'
and
betters'
talk
it's
not
manners
and
it's
not
straight
what
i'm
going
to
do
or
not
going
to
do
in
the
cathedral
to-morrow
is
none
of
your
business
and
if
i
catch
sight
of
you
hanging
about
the
place
to-morrow
after
your
work's
done
i'll
send
you
home
with
a
flea
in
your
ear
now
you
mind
that'
of
course
i
said
i
was
very
sorry
and
that
and
equally
of
course
i
went
off
and
laid
my
plans
with
evans
we
knew
there
was
a
stair
up
in
the
corner
of
the
transept
which
you
can
get
up
to
the
triforium
and
in
them
days
the
door
to
it
was
pretty
well
always
open
and
even
if
it
wasn't
we
knew
the
key
usually
laid
under
a
bit
of
matting
hard
by
so
we
made
up
our
minds
we'd
be
putting
away
music
and
that
next
morning
while
the
rest
of
the
boys
was
clearing
off
and
then
slip
up
the
stairs
and
watch
from
the
triforium
if
there
was
any
signs
of
work
going
on
well
that
same
night
i
dropped
off
asleep
as
sound
as
a
boy
does
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
dog
woke
me
up
coming
into
the
bed
and
thought
i
now
we're
going
to
get
it
sharp
for
he
seemed
more
frightened
than
usual
after
about
five
minutes
sure
enough
came
this
cry
i
can't
give
you
no
idea
what
it
was
like
and
so
near
too--nearer
than
i'd
heard
it
yet--and
a
funny
thing
mr
lake
you
know
what
a
place
this
close
is
for
an
echo
and
particular
if
you
stand
this
side
of
it
well
this
crying
never
made
no
sign
of
an
echo
at
all
but
as
i
said
it
was
dreadful
near
this
night
and
on
the
top
of
the
start
i
got
with
hearing
it
i
got
another
fright
for
i
heard
something
rustling
outside
in
the
passage
now
to
be
sure
i
thought
i
was
done
but
i
noticed
the
dog
seemed
to
perk
up
a
bit
and
next
there
was
some
one
whispered
outside
the
door
and
i
very
near
laughed
out
loud
for
i
knew
it
was
my
father
and
mother
that
had
got
out
of
bed
with
the
noise
'whatever
is
it'
says
my
mother
'hush
i
don't
know'
says
my
father
excited-like
'don't
disturb
the
boy
i
hope
he
didn't
hear
nothing'
so
me
knowing
they
were
just
outside
it
made
me
bolder
and
i
slipped
out
of
bed
across
to
my
little
window--giving
on
the
close--but
the
dog
he
bored
right
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
bed--and
i
looked
out
first
go
off
i
couldn't
see
anything
then
right
down
in
the
shadow
under
a
buttress
i
made
out
what
i
shall
always
say
was
two
spots
of
red--a
dull
red
it
was--nothing
like
a
lamp
or
a
fire
but
just
so
as
you
could
pick
'em
out
of
the
black
shadow
i
hadn't
but
just
sighted
'em
when
it
seemed
we
wasn't
the
only
people
that
had
been
disturbed
because
i
see
a
window
in
a
house
on
the
left-hand
side
become
lighted
up
and
the
light
moving
i
just
turned
my
head
to
make
sure
of
it
and
then
looked
back
into
the
shadow
for
those
two
red
things
and
they
were
gone
and
for
all
i
peered
about
and
stared
there
was
not
a
sign
more
of
them
then
come
my
last
fright
that
night--something
come
against
my
bare
leg--but
that
was
all
right
that
was
my
little
dog
had
come
out
of
bed
and
prancing
about
making
a
great
to-do
only
holding
his
tongue
and
me
seeing
he
was
quite
in
spirits
again
i
took
him
back
to
bed
and
we
slept
the
night
out
next
morning
i
made
out
to
tell
my
mother
i'd
had
the
dog
in
my
room
and
i
was
surprised
after
all
she'd
said
about
it
before
how
quiet
she
took
it
'did
you'
she
says
'well
by
good
rights
you
ought
to
go
without
your
breakfast
for
doing
such
a
thing
behind
my
back
but
i
don't
know
as
there's
any
great
harm
done
only
another
time
you
ask
my
permission
do
you
hear'
a
bit
after
that
i
said
something
to
my
father
about
having
heard
the
cats
again
'cats'
he
says
and
he
looked
over
at
my
poor
mother
and
she
coughed
and
he
says
'oh
ah
yes
cats
i
believe
i
heard
'em
myself'
that
was
a
funny
morning
altogether
nothing
seemed
to
go
right
the
organist
he
stopped
in
bed
and
the
minor
canon
he
forgot
it
was
the
19th
day
and
waited
for
the
venite
and
after
a
bit
the
deputy
he
set
off
playing
the
chant
for
evensong
which
was
a
minor
and
then
the
decani
boys
were
laughing
so
much
they
couldn't
sing
and
when
it
came
to
the
anthem
the
solo
boy
he
got
took
with
the
giggles
and
made
out
his
nose
was
bleeding
and
shoved
the
book
at
me
what
hadn't
practised
the
verse
and
wasn't
much
of
a
singer
if
i
had
known
it
well
things
was
rougher
you
see
fifty
years
ago
and
i
got
a
nip
from
the
counter-tenor
behind
me
that
i
remembered
so
we
got
through
somehow
and
neither
the
men
nor
the
boys
weren't
by
way
of
waiting
to
see
whether
the
canon
in
residence--mr
henslow
it
was--would
come
to
the
vestries
and
fine
'em
but
i
don't
believe
he
did
for
one
thing
i
fancy
he'd
read
the
wrong
lesson
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
knew
it
anyhow
evans
and
me
didn't
find
no
difficulty
in
slipping
up
the
stairs
as
i
told
you
and
when
we
got
up
we
laid
ourselves
down
flat
on
our
stomachs
where
we
could
just
stretch
our
heads
out
over
the
old
tomb
and
we
hadn't
but
just
done
so
when
we
heard
the
verger
that
was
then
first
shutting
the
iron
porch-gates
and
locking
the
south-west
door
and
then
the
transept
door
so
we
knew
there
was
something
up
and
they
meant
to
keep
the
public
out
for
a
bit
next
thing
was
the
dean
and
the
canon
come
in
by
their
door
on
the
north
and
then
i
see
my
father
and
old
palmer
and
a
couple
of
their
best
men
and
palmer
stood
a
talking
for
a
bit
with
the
dean
in
the
middle
of
the
choir
he
had
a
coil
of
rope
and
the
men
had
crows
all
of
'em
looked
a
bit
nervous
so
there
they
stood
talking
and
at
last
i
heard
the
dean
say
'well
i've
no
time
to
waste
palmer
if
you
think
this'll
satisfy
southminster
people
i'll
permit
it
to
be
done
but
i
must
say
this
that
never
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
have
i
heard
such
arrant
nonsense
from
a
practical
man
as
i
have
from
you
don't
you
agree
with
me
henslow'
as
far
as
i
could
hear
mr
henslow
said
something
like
'oh
well
we're
told
aren't
we
mr
dean
not
to
judge
others'
and
the
dean
he
gave
a
kind
of
sniff
and
walked
straight
up
to
the
tomb
and
took
his
stand
behind
it
with
his
back
to
the
screen
and
the
others
they
come
edging
up
rather
gingerly
henslow
he
stopped
on
the
south
side
and
scratched
on
his
chin
he
did
then
the
dean
spoke
up
'palmer'
he
says
'which
can
you
do
easiest
get
the
slab
off
the
top
or
shift
one
of
the
side
slabs'
old
palmer
and
his
men
they
pottered
about
a
bit
looking
round
the
edge
of
the
top
slab
and
sounding
the
sides
on
the
south
and
east
and
west
and
everywhere
but
the
north
henslow
said
something
about
it
being
better
to
have
a
try
at
the
south
side
because
there
was
more
light
and
more
room
to
move
about
in
then
my
father
who'd
been
watching
of
them
went
round
to
the
north
side
and
knelt
down
and
felt
of
the
slab
by
the
chink
and
he
got
up
and
dusted
his
knees
and
says
to
the
dean
'beg
pardon
mr
dean
but
i
think
if
mr
palmer'll
try
this
here
slab
he'll
find
it'll
come
out
easy
enough
seems
to
me
one
of
the
men
could
prize
it
out
with
his
crow
by
means
of
this
chink'
'ah
thank
you
worby'
says
the
dean
'that's
a
good
suggestion
palmer
let
one
of
your
men
do
that
will
you'
so
the
man
come
round
and
put
his
bar
in
and
bore
on
it
and
just
that
minute
when
they
were
all
bending
over
and
we
boys
got
our
heads
well
out
over
the
edge
of
the
triforium
there
come
a
most
fearful
crash
down
at
the
west
end
of
the
choir
as
if
a
whole
stack
of
big
timber
had
fallen
down
a
flight
of
stairs
well
you
can't
expect
me
to
tell
you
everything
that
happened
all
in
a
minute
of
course
there
was
a
terrible
commotion
i
heard
the
slab
fall
out
and
the
crowbar
on
the
floor
and
i
heard
the
dean
say
'good
god'
when
i
looked
down
again
i
saw
the
dean
tumbled
over
on
the
floor
the
men
was
making
off
down
the
choir
henslow
was
just
going
to
help
the
dean
up
palmer
was
going
to
stop
the
men
as
he
said
afterwards
and
my
father
was
sitting
on
the
altar
step
with
his
face
in
his
hands
the
dean
he
was
very
cross
'i
wish
to
goodness
you'd
look
where
you're
coming
to
henslow'
he
says
'why
you
should
all
take
to
your
heels
when
a
stick
of
wood
tumbles
down
i
cannot
imagine'
and
all
henslow
could
do
explaining
he
was
right
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
tomb
would
not
satisfy
him
then
palmer
came
back
and
reported
there
was
nothing
to
account
for
this
noise
and
nothing
seemingly
fallen
down
and
when
the
dean
finished
feeling
of
himself
they
gathered
round--except
my
father
he
sat
where
he
was--and
some
one
lighted
up
a
bit
of
candle
and
they
looked
into
the
tomb
'nothing
there'
says
the
dean
'what
did
i
tell
you
stay
here's
something
what's
this
a
bit
of
music
paper
and
a
piece
of
torn
stuff--part
of
a
dress
it
looks
like
both
quite
modern--no
interest
whatever
another
time
perhaps
you'll
take
the
advice
of
an
educated
man'--or
something
like
that
and
off
he
went
limping
a
bit
and
out
through
the
north
door
only
as
he
went
he
called
back
angry
to
palmer
for
leaving
the
door
standing
open
palmer
called
out
'very
sorry
sir'
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
henslow
says
'i
fancy
mr
dean's
mistaken
i
closed
the
door
behind
me
but
he's
a
little
upset'
then
palmer
says
'why
where's
worby'
and
they
saw
him
sitting
on
the
step
and
went
up
to
him
he
was
recovering
himself
it
seemed
and
wiping
his
forehead
and
palmer
helped
him
up
on
to
his
legs
as
i
was
glad
to
see
they
were
too
far
off
for
me
to
hear
what
they
said
but
my
father
pointed
to
the
north
door
in
the
aisle
and
palmer
and
henslow
both
of
them
looked
very
surprised
and
scared
after
a
bit
my
father
and
henslow
went
out
of
the
church
and
the
others
made
what
haste
they
could
to
put
the
slab
back
and
plaster
it
in
and
about
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
the
cathedral
was
opened
again
and
us
boys
made
the
best
of
our
way
home
i
was
in
a
great
taking
to
know
what
it
was
had
given
my
poor
father
such
a
turn
and
when
i
got
in
and
found
him
sitting
in
his
chair
taking
a
glass
of
spirits
and
my
mother
standing
looking
anxious
at
him
i
couldn't
keep
from
bursting
out
and
making
confession
where
i'd
been
but
he
didn't
seem
to
take
on
not
in
the
way
of
losing
his
temper
'you
was
there
was
you
well
did
you
see
it'
'i
see
everything
father'
i
said
'except
when
the
noise
came'
'did
you
see
what
it
was
knocked
the
dean
over'
he
says
'that
what
come
out
of
the
monument
you
didn't
well
that's
a
mercy'
'why
what
was
it
father'
i
said
'come
you
must
have
seen
it'
he
says
'didn't
you
see
a
thing
like
a
man
all
over
hair
and
two
great
eyes
to
it'
well
that
was
all
i
could
get
out
of
him
that
time
and
later
on
he
seemed
as
if
he
was
ashamed
of
being
so
frightened
and
he
used
to
put
me
off
when
i
asked
him
about
it
but
years
after
when
i
was
got
to
be
a
grown
man
we
had
more
talk
now
and
again
on
the
matter
and
he
always
said
the
same
thing
'black
it
was'
he'd
say
'and
a
mass
of
hair
and
two
legs
and
the
light
caught
on
its
eyes'
well
that's
the
tale
of
that
tomb
mr
lake
it's
one
we
don't
tell
to
our
visitors
and
i
should
be
obliged
to
you
not
to
make
any
use
of
it
till
i'm
out
of
the
way
i
doubt
mr
evans'll
feel
the
same
as
i
do
if
you
ask
him
this
proved
to
be
the
case
but
over
twenty
years
have
passed
by
and
the
grass
is
growing
over
both
worby
and
evans
so
mr
lake
felt
no
difficulty
about
communicating
his
notes--taken
in
1890--to
me
he
accompanied
them
with
a
sketch
of
the
tomb
and
a
copy
of
the
short
inscription
on
the
metal
cross
which
was
affixed
at
the
expense
of
dr
lyall
to
the
centre
of
the
northern
side
it
was
from
the
vulgate
of
isaiah
xxxiv
and
consisted
merely
of
the
three
words--
ibi
cubavit
lamia
the
story
of
a
disappearance
and
an
appearance
the
story
of
a
disappearance
and
an
appearance
the
letters
which
i
now
publish
were
sent
to
me
recently
by
a
person
who
knows
me
to
be
interested
in
ghost
stories
there
is
no
doubt
about
their
authenticity
the
paper
on
which
they
are
written
the
ink
and
the
whole
external
aspect
put
their
date
beyond
the
reach
of
question
the
only
point
which
they
do
not
make
clear
is
the
identity
of
the
writer
he
signs
with
initials
only
and
as
none
of
the
envelopes
of
the
letters
are
preserved
the
surname
of
his
correspondent--obviously
a
married
brother--is
as
obscure
as
his
own
no
further
preliminary
explanation
is
needed
i
think
luckily
the
first
letter
supplies
all
that
could
be
expected

1837
my
dear
robert--it
is
with
great
regret
for
the
enjoyment
i
am
losing
and
for
a
reason
which
you
will
deplore
equally
with
myself
that
i
write
to
inform
you
that
i
am
unable
to
join
your
circle
for
this
christmas
but
you
will
agree
with
me
that
it
is
unavoidable
when
i
say
that
i
have
within
these
few
hours
received
a
letter
from
mrs
hunt
at
b----
to
the
effect
that
our
uncle
henry
has
suddenly
and
mysteriously
disappeared
and
begging
me
to
go
down
there
immediately
and
join
the
search
that
is
being
made
for
him
little
as
i
or
you
either
i
think
have
ever
seen
of
uncle
i
naturally
feel
that
this
is
not
a
request
that
can
be
regarded
lightly
and
accordingly
i
propose
to
go
to
b----
by
this
afternoon's
mail
reaching
it
late
in
the
evening
i
shall
not
go
to
the
rectory
but
put
up
at
the
king's
head
and
to
which
you
may
address
letters
i
enclose
a
small
draft
which
you
will
please
make
use
of
for
the
benefit
of
the
young
people
i
shall
write
you
daily
supposing
me
to
be
detained
more
than
a
single
day
what
goes
on
and
you
may
be
sure
should
the
business
be
cleared
up
in
time
to
permit
of
my
coming
to
the
manor
after
all
i
shall
present
myself
i
have
but
a
few
minutes
at
disposal
with
cordial

my
dear
robert--in
the
first
place
there
is
as
yet
no
news
of
uncle
h
and
i
think
you
may
finally
dismiss
any
idea--i
won't
say
hope--that
i
might
after
all
turn
up
for
xmas
however
my
thoughts
will
be
with
you
and
you
have
my
best
wishes
for
a
really
festive
day
mind
that
none
of
my
nephews
or
nieces
expend
any
fraction
of
their
guineas
on
presents
for
me
since
i
got
here
i
have
been
blaming
myself
for
taking
this
affair
of
uncle
h
too
easily
from
what
people
here
say
i
gather
that
there
is
very
little
hope
that
he
can
still
be
alive
but
whether
it
is
accident
or
design
that
carried
him
off
i
cannot
judge
the
facts
are
these
on
friday
the
19th
he
went
as
usual
shortly
before
five
o'clock
to
read
evening
prayers
at
the
church
and
when
they
were
over
the
clerk
brought
him
a
message
in
response
to
which
he
set
off
to
pay
a
visit
to
a
sick
person
at
an
outlying
cottage
the
better
part
of
two
miles
away
he
paid
the
visit
and
started
on
his
return
journey
at
about
half-past
six
this
is
the
last
that
is
known
of
him
the
people
here
are
very
much
grieved
at
his
loss
he
had
been
here
many
years
as
you
know
and
though
as
you
also
know
he
was
not
the
most
genial
of
men
and
had
more
than
a
little
of
the
martinet
in
his
composition
he
seems
to
have
been
active
in
good
works
and
unsparing
of
trouble
to
himself
poor
mrs
hunt
who
has
been
his
housekeeper
ever
since
she
left
woodley
is
quite
overcome
it
seems
like
the
end
of
the
world
to
her
i
am
glad
that
i
did
not
entertain
the
idea
of
taking
quarters
at
the
rectory
and
i
have
declined
several
kindly
offers
of
hospitality
from
people
in
the
place
preferring
as
i
do
to
be
independent
and
finding
myself
very
comfortable
here
you
will
of
course
wish
to
know
what
has
been
done
in
the
way
of
inquiry
and
search
first
nothing
was
to
be
expected
from
investigation
at
the
rectory
and
to
be
brief
nothing
has
transpired
i
asked
mrs
hunt--as
others
had
done
before--whether
there
was
either
any
unfavourable
symptom
in
her
master
such
as
might
portend
a
sudden
stroke
or
attack
of
illness
or
whether
he
had
ever
had
reason
to
apprehend
any
such
thing
but
both
she
and
also
his
medical
man
were
clear
that
this
was
not
the
case
he
was
quite
in
his
usual
health
in
the
second
place
naturally
ponds
and
streams
have
been
dragged
and
fields
in
the
neighbourhood
which
he
is
known
to
have
visited
last
have
been
searched--without
result
i
have
myself
talked
to
the
parish
clerk
and--more
important--have
been
to
the
house
where
he
paid
his
visit
there
can
be
no
question
of
any
foul
play
on
these
people's
part
the
one
man
in
the
house
is
ill
in
bed
and
very
weak
the
wife
and
the
children
of
course
could
do
nothing
themselves
nor
is
there
the
shadow
of
a
probability
that
they
or
any
of
them
should
have
agreed
to
decoy
poor
uncle
h
out
in
order
that
he
might
be
attacked
on
the
way
back
they
had
told
what
they
knew
to
several
other
inquirers
already
but
the
woman
repeated
it
to
me
the
rector
was
looking
just
as
usual
he
wasn't
very
long
with
the
sick
man--he
ain't
she
said
like
some
what
has
a
gift
in
prayer
but
there
if
we
was
all
that
way
'owever
would
the
chapel
people
get
their
living
he
left
some
money
when
he
went
away
and
one
of
the
children
saw
him
cross
the
stile
into
the
next
field
he
was
dressed
as
he
always
was
wore
his
bands--i
gather
he
is
nearly
the
last
man
remaining
who
does
so--at
any
rate
in
this
district
you
see
i
am
putting
down
everything
the
fact
is
that
i
have
nothing
else
to
do
having
brought
no
business
papers
with
me
and
moreover
it
serves
to
clear
my
own
mind
and
may
suggest
points
which
have
been
overlooked
so
i
shall
continue
to
write
all
that
passes
even
to
conversations
if
need
be--you
may
read
or
not
as
you
please
but
pray
keep
the
letters
i
have
another
reason
for
writing
so
fully
but
it
is
not
a
very
tangible
one
you
may
ask
if
i
have
myself
made
any
search
in
the
fields
near
the
cottage
something--a
good
deal--has
been
done
by
others
as
i
mentioned
but
i
hope
to
go
over
the
ground
to-morrow
bow
street
has
now
been
informed
and
will
send
down
by
to-night's
coach
but
i
do
not
think
they
will
make
much
of
the
job
there
is
no
snow
which
might
have
helped
us
the
fields
are
all
grass
of
course
i
was
on
the
qui
vive
for
any
indication
to-day
both
going
and
returning
but
there
was
a
thick
mist
on
the
way
back
and
i
was
not
in
trim
for
wandering
about
unknown
pastures
especially
on
an
evening
when
bushes
looked
like
men
and
a
cow
lowing
in
the
distance
might
have
been
the
last
trump
i
assure
you
if
uncle
henry
had
stepped
out
from
among
the
trees
in
a
little
copse
which
borders
the
path
at
one
place
carrying
his
head
under
his
arm
i
should
have
been
very
little
more
uncomfortable
than
i
was
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
rather
expecting
something
of
the
kind
but
i
must
drop
my
pen
for
the
moment
mr
lucas
the
curate
is
announced
later
mr
lucas
has
been
and
gone
and
there
is
not
much
beyond
the
decencies
of
ordinary
sentiment
to
be
got
from
him
i
can
see
that
he
has
given
up
any
idea
that
the
rector
can
be
alive
and
that
so
far
as
he
can
be
he
is
truly
sorry
i
can
also
discern
that
even
in
a
more
emotional
person
than
mr
lucas
uncle
henry
was
not
likely
to
inspire
strong
attachment
besides
mr
lucas
i
have
had
another
visitor
in
the
shape
of
my
boniface--mine
host
of
the
king's
head--who
came
to
see
whether
i
had
everything
i
wished
and
who
really
requires
the
pen
of
a
boz
to
do
him
justice
he
was
very
solemn
and
weighty
at
first
well
sir
he
said
i
suppose
we
must
bow
our
'ead
beneath
the
blow
as
my
poor
wife
had
used
to
say
so
far
as
i
can
gather
there's
been
neither
hide
nor
yet
hair
of
our
late
respected
incumbent
scented
out
as
yet
not
that
he
was
what
the
scripture
terms
a
hairy
man
in
any
sense
of
the
word
i
said--as
well
as
i
could--that
i
supposed
not
but
could
not
help
adding
that
i
had
heard
he
was
sometimes
a
little
difficult
to
deal
with
mr
bowman
looked
at
me
sharply
for
a
moment
and
then
passed
in
a
flash
from
solemn
sympathy
to
impassioned
declamation
when
i
think
he
said
of
the
language
that
man
see
fit
to
employ
to
me
in
this
here
parlour
over
no
more
a
matter
than
a
cask
of
beer--such
a
thing
as
i
told
him
might
happen
any
day
of
the
week
to
a
man
with
a
family--though
as
it
turned
out
he
was
quite
under
a
mistake
and
that
i
knew
at
the
time
only
i
was
that
shocked
to
hear
him
i
couldn't
lay
my
tongue
to
the
right
expression
he
stopped
abruptly
and
eyed
me
with
some
embarrassment
i
only
said
dear
me
i'm
sorry
to
hear
you
had
any
little
differences
i
suppose
my
uncle
will
be
a
good
deal
missed
in
the
parish
mr
bowman
drew
a
long
breath
ah
yes
he
said
your
uncle
you'll
understand
me
when
i
say
that
for
the
moment
it
had
slipped
my
remembrance
that
he
was
a
relative
and
natural
enough
i
must
say
as
it
should
for
as
to
you
bearing
any
resemblance
to--to
him
the
notion
of
any
such
a
thing
is
clean
ridiculous
all
the
same
'ad
i
'ave
bore
it
in
my
mind
you'll
be
among
the
first
to
feel
i'm
sure
as
i
should
have
abstained
my
lips
or
rather
i
should
not
have
abstained
my
lips
with
no
such
reflections
i
assured
him
that
i
quite
understood
and
was
going
to
have
asked
him
some
further
questions
but
he
was
called
away
to
see
after
some
business
by
the
way
you
need
not
take
it
into
your
head
that
he
has
anything
to
fear
from
the
inquiry
into
poor
uncle
henry's
disappearance--though
no
doubt
in
the
watches
of
the
night
it
will
occur
to
him
that
i
think
he
has
and
i
may
expect
explanations
to-morrow
i
must
close
this
letter
it
has
to
go
by
the
late
coach
letter
iii
dec
25
'37
my
dear
robert--this
is
a
curious
letter
to
be
writing
on
christmas
day
and
yet
after
all
there
is
nothing
much
in
it
or
there
may
be--you
shall
be
the
judge
at
least
nothing
decisive
the
bow
street
men
practically
say
that
they
have
no
clue
the
length
of
time
and
the
weather
conditions
have
made
all
tracks
so
faint
as
to
be
quite
useless
nothing
that
belonged
to
the
dead
man--i'm
afraid
no
other
word
will
do--has
been
picked
up
as
i
expected
mr
bowman
was
uneasy
in
his
mind
this
morning
quite
early
i
heard
him
holding
forth
in
a
very
distinct
voice--purposely
so
i
thought--to
the
bow
street
officers
in
the
bar
as
to
the
loss
that
the
town
had
sustained
in
their
rector
and
as
to
the
necessity
of
leaving
no
stone
unturned
he
was
very
great
on
this
phrase
in
order
to
come
at
the
truth
i
suspect
him
of
being
an
orator
of
repute
at
convivial
meetings
when
i
was
at
breakfast
he
came
to
wait
on
me
and
took
an
opportunity
when
handing
a
muffin
to
say
in
a
low
tone
i
'ope
sir
you
reconize
as
my
feelings
towards
your
relative
is
not
actuated
by
any
taint
of
what
you
may
call
melignity--you
can
leave
the
room
eliza
i
will
see
the
gentleman
'as
all
he
requires
with
my
own
hands--i
ask
your
pardon
sir
but
you
must
be
well
aware
a
man
is
not
always
master
of
himself
and
when
that
man
has
been
'urt
in
his
mind
by
the
application
of
expressions
which
i
will
go
so
far
as
to
say
'ad
not
ought
to
have
been
made
use
of
his
voice
was
rising
all
this
time
and
his
face
growing
redder
no
sir
and
'ere
if
you
will
permit
of
it
i
should
like
to
explain
to
you
in
a
very
few
words
the
exact
state
of
the
bone
of
contention
this
cask--i
might
more
truly
call
it
a
firkin--of
beer--
i
felt
it
was
time
to
interpose
and
said
that
i
did
not
see
that
it
would
help
us
very
much
to
go
into
that
matter
in
detail
mr
bowman
acquiesced
and
resumed
more
calmly
well
sir
i
bow
to
your
ruling
and
as
you
say
be
that
here
or
be
it
there
it
don't
contribute
a
great
deal
perhaps
to
the
present
question
all
i
wish
you
to
understand
is
that
i
am
prepared
as
you
are
yourself
to
lend
every
hand
to
the
business
we
have
afore
us
and--as
i
took
the
opportunity
to
say
as
much
to
the
orficers
not
three-quarters
of
an
hour
ago--to
leave
no
stone
unturned
as
may
throw
even
a
spark
of
light
on
this
painful
matter
in
fact
mr
bowman
did
accompany
us
on
our
exploration
but
though
i
am
sure
his
genuine
wish
was
to
be
helpful
i
am
afraid
he
did
not
contribute
to
the
serious
side
of
it
he
appeared
to
be
under
the
impression
that
we
were
likely
to
meet
either
uncle
henry
or
the
person
responsible
for
his
disappearance
walking
about
the
fields--and
did
a
great
deal
of
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
calling
our
attention
by
pointing
with
his
stick
to
distant
cattle
and
labourers
he
held
several
long
conversations
with
old
women
whom
we
met
and
was
very
strict
and
severe
in
his
manner--but
on
each
occasion
returned
to
our
party
saying
well
i
find
she
don't
seem
to
'ave
no
connexion
with
this
sad
affair
i
think
you
may
take
it
from
me
sir
as
there's
little
or
no
light
to
be
looked
for
from
that
quarter
not
without
she's
keeping
somethink
back
intentional
we
gained
no
appreciable
result
as
i
told
you
at
starting
the
bow
street
men
have
left
the
town
whether
for
london
or
not
i
am
not
sure
this
evening
i
had
company
in
the
shape
of
a
bagman
a
smartish
fellow
he
knew
what
was
going
forward
but
though
he
has
been
on
the
roads
for
some
days
about
here
he
had
nothing
to
tell
of
suspicious
characters--tramps
wandering
sailors
or
gipsies
he
was
very
full
of
a
capital
punch
and
judy
show
he
had
seen
this
same
day
at
w----
and
asked
if
it
had
been
here
yet
and
advised
me
by
no
means
to
miss
it
if
it
does
come
the
best
punch
and
the
best
toby
dog
he
said
he
had
ever
come
across
toby
dogs
you
know
are
the
last
new
thing
in
the
shows
i
have
only
seen
one
myself
but
before
long
all
the
men
will
have
them
now
why
you
will
want
to
know
do
i
trouble
to
write
all
this
to
you
i
am
obliged
to
do
it
because
it
has
something
to
do
with
another
absurd
trifle
as
you
will
inevitably
say
which
in
my
present
state
of
rather
unquiet
fancy--nothing
more
perhaps--i
have
to
put
down
it
is
a
dream
sir
which
i
am
going
to
record
and
i
must
say
it
is
one
of
the
oddest
i
have
had
is
there
anything
in
it
beyond
what
the
bagman's
talk
and
uncle
henry's
disappearance
could
have
suggested
you
i
repeat
shall
judge
i
am
not
in
a
sufficiently
cool
and
judicial
frame
to
do
so
it
began
with
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
pulling
aside
of
curtains
and
i
found
myself
seated
in
a
place--i
don't
know
whether
in
doors
or
out
there
were
people--only
a
few--on
either
side
of
me
but
i
did
not
recognize
them
or
indeed
think
much
about
them
they
never
spoke
but
so
far
as
i
remember
were
all
grave
and
pale-faced
and
looked
fixedly
before
them
facing
me
there
was
a
punch
and
judy
show
perhaps
rather
larger
than
the
ordinary
ones
painted
with
black
figures
on
a
reddish-yellow
ground
behind
it
and
on
each
side
was
only
darkness
but
in
front
there
was
a
sufficiency
of
light
i
was
strung
up
to
a
high
degree
of
expectation
and
listened
every
moment
to
hear
the
panpipes
and
the
roo-too-too-it
instead
of
that
there
came
suddenly
an
enormous--i
can
use
no
other
word--an
enormous
single
toll
of
a
bell
i
don't
know
from
how
far
off--somewhere
behind
the
little
curtain
flew
up
and
the
drama
began
i
believe
someone
once
tried
to
re-write
punch
as
a
serious
tragedy
but
whoever
he
may
have
been
this
performance
would
have
suited
him
exactly
there
was
something
satanic
about
the
hero
he
varied
his
methods
of
attack
for
some
of
his
victims
he
lay
in
wait
and
to
see
his
horrible
face--it
was
yellowish
white
i
may
remark--peering
round
the
wings
made
me
think
of
the
vampyre
in
fuseli's
foul
sketch
to
others
he
was
polite
and
carneying--particularly
to
the
unfortunate
alien
who
can
only
say
shallabalah--though
what
punch
said
i
never
could
catch
but
with
all
of
them
i
came
to
dread
the
moment
of
death
the
crack
of
the
stick
on
their
skulls
which
in
the
ordinary
way
delights
me
had
here
a
crushing
sound
as
if
the
bone
was
giving
way
and
the
victims
quivered
and
kicked
as
they
lay
the
baby--it
sounds
more
ridiculous
as
i
go
on--the
baby
i
am
sure
was
alive
punch
wrung
its
neck
and
if
the
choke
or
squeak
which
it
gave
were
not
real
i
know
nothing
of
reality
the
stage
got
perceptibly
darker
as
each
crime
was
consummated
and
at
last
there
was
one
murder
which
was
done
quite
in
the
dark
so
that
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
victim
and
took
some
time
to
effect
it
was
accompanied
by
hard
breathing
and
horrid
muffled
sounds
and
after
it
punch
came
and
sat
on
the
foot-board
and
fanned
himself
and
looked
at
his
shoes
which
were
bloody
and
hung
his
head
on
one
side
and
sniggered
in
so
deadly
a
fashion
that
i
saw
some
of
those
beside
me
cover
their
faces
and
i
would
gladly
have
done
the
same
but
in
the
meantime
the
scene
behind
punch
was
clearing
and
showed
not
the
usual
house
front
but
something
more
ambitious--a
grove
of
trees
and
the
gentle
slope
of
a
hill
with
a
very
natural--in
fact
i
should
say
a
real--moon
shining
on
it
over
this
there
rose
slowly
an
object
which
i
soon
perceived
to
be
a
human
figure
with
something
peculiar
about
the
head--what
i
was
unable
at
first
to
see
it
did
not
stand
on
its
feet
but
began
creeping
or
dragging
itself
across
the
middle
distance
towards
punch
who
still
sat
back
to
it
and
by
this
time
i
may
remark
though
it
did
not
occur
to
me
at
the
moment
that
all
pretence
of
this
being
a
puppet
show
had
vanished
punch
was
still
punch
it
is
true
but
like
the
others
was
in
some
sense
a
live
creature
and
both
moved
themselves
at
their
own
will
when
i
next
glanced
at
him
he
was
sitting
in
malignant
reflection
but
in
another
instant
something
seemed
to
attract
his
attention
and
he
first
sat
up
sharply
and
then
turned
round
and
evidently
caught
sight
of
the
person
that
was
approaching
him
and
was
in
fact
now
very
near
then
indeed
did
he
show
unmistakable
signs
of
terror
catching
up
his
stick
he
rushed
towards
the
wood
only
just
eluding
the
arm
of
his
pursuer
which
was
suddenly
flung
out
to
intercept
him
it
was
with
a
revulsion
which
i
cannot
easily
express
that
i
now
saw
more
or
less
clearly
what
this
pursuer
was
like
he
was
a
sturdy
figure
clad
in
black
and
as
i
thought
wearing
bands
his
head
was
covered
with
a
whitish
bag
the
chase
which
now
began
lasted
i
do
not
know
how
long
now
among
the
trees
now
along
the
slope
of
the
field
sometimes
both
figures
disappearing
wholly
for
a
few
seconds
and
only
some
uncertain
sounds
letting
one
know
that
they
were
still
afoot
at
length
there
came
a
moment
when
punch
evidently
exhausted
staggered
in
from
the
left
and
threw
himself
down
among
the
trees
his
pursuer
was
not
long
after
him
and
came
looking
uncertainly
from
side
to
side
then
catching
sight
of
the
figure
on
the
ground
he
too
threw
himself
down--his
back
was
turned
to
the
audience--with
a
swift
motion
twitched
the
covering
from
his
head
and
thrust
his
face
into
that
of
punch
everything
on
the
instant
grew
dark
there
was
one
long
loud
shuddering
scream
and
i
awoke
to
find
myself
looking
straight
into
the
face
of--what
in
all
the
world
do
you
think--but
a
large
owl
which
was
seated
on
my
window-sill
immediately
opposite
my
bed-foot
holding
up
its
wings
like
two
shrouded
arms
i
caught
the
fierce
glance
of
its
yellow
eyes
and
then
it
was
gone
i
heard
the
single
enormous
bell
again--very
likely
as
you
are
saying
to
yourself
the
church
clock
but
i
do
not
think
so--and
then
i
was
broad
awake
all
this
i
may
say
happened
within
the
last
half-hour
there
was
no
probability
of
my
getting
to
sleep
again
so
i
got
up
put
on
clothes
enough
to
keep
me
warm
and
am
writing
this
rigmarole
in
the
first
hours
of
christmas
day
have
i
left
out
anything
yes
there
was
no
toby
dog
and
the
names
over
the
front
of
the
punch
and
judy
booth
were
kidman
and
gallop
which
were
certainly
not
what
the
bagman
told
me
to
look
out
for
by
this
time
i
feel
a
little
more
as
if
i
could
sleep
so
this
shall
be
sealed
and
wafered
letter
iv
dec
26
'37
my
dear
robert--all
is
over
the
body
has
been
found
i
do
not
make
excuses
for
not
having
sent
off
my
news
by
last
night's
mail
for
the
simple
reason
that
i
was
incapable
of
putting
pen
to
paper
the
events
that
attended
the
discovery
bewildered
me
so
completely
that
i
needed
what
i
could
get
of
a
night's
rest
to
enable
me
to
face
the
situation
at
all
now
i
can
give
you
my
journal
of
the
day
certainly
the
strangest
christmas
day
that
ever
i
spent
or
am
likely
to
spend
the
first
incident
was
not
very
serious
mr
bowman
had
i
think
been
keeping
christmas
eve
and
was
a
little
inclined
to
be
captious
at
least
he
was
not
on
foot
very
early
and
to
judge
from
what
i
could
hear
neither
men
or
maids
could
do
anything
to
please
him
the
latter
were
certainly
reduced
to
tears
nor
am
i
sure
that
mr
bowman
succeeded
in
preserving
a
manly
composure
at
any
rate
when
i
came
downstairs
it
was
in
a
broken
voice
that
he
wished
me
the
compliments
of
the
season
and
a
little
later
on
when
he
paid
his
visit
of
ceremony
at
breakfast
he
was
far
from
cheerful
even
byronic
i
might
almost
say
in
his
outlook
on
life
i
don't
know
he
said
if
you
think
with
me
sir
but
every
christmas
as
comes
round
the
world
seems
a
hollerer
thing
to
me
why
take
an
example
now
from
what
lays
under
my
own
eye
there's
my
servant
eliza--been
with
me
now
for
going
on
fifteen
years
i
thought
i
could
have
placed
my
confidence
in
elizar
and
yet
this
very
morning--christmas
morning
too
of
all
the
blessed
days
in
the
year--with
the
bells
a
ringing
and--and--all
like
that--i
say
this
very
morning
had
it
not
have
been
for
providence
watching
over
us
all
that
girl
would
have
put--indeed
i
may
go
so
far
to
say
'ad
put
the
cheese
on
your
breakfast
table----
he
saw
i
was
about
to
speak
and
waved
his
hand
at
me
it's
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
'yes
mr
bowman
but
you
took
away
the
cheese
and
locked
it
up
in
the
cupboard'
which
i
did
and
have
the
key
here
or
if
not
the
actual
key
one
very
much
about
the
same
size
that's
true
enough
sir
but
what
do
you
think
is
the
effect
of
that
action
on
me
why
it's
no
exaggeration
for
me
to
say
that
the
ground
is
cut
from
under
my
feet
and
yet
when
i
said
as
much
to
eliza
not
nasty
mind
you
but
just
firm
like
what
was
my
return
'oh'
she
says
'well'
she
says
'there
wasn't
no
bones
broke
i
suppose'
well
sir
it
'urt
me
that's
all
i
can
say
it
'urt
me
and
i
don't
like
to
think
of
it
now
there
was
an
ominous
pause
here
in
which
i
ventured
to
say
something
like
yes
very
trying
and
then
asked
at
what
hour
the
church
service
was
to
be
eleven
o'clock
mr
bowman
said
with
a
heavy
sigh
ah
you
won't
have
no
such
discourse
from
poor
mr
lucas
as
what
you
would
have
done
from
our
late
rector
him
and
me
may
have
had
our
little
differences
and
did
do
more's
the
pity
i
could
see
that
a
powerful
effort
was
needed
to
keep
him
off
the
vexed
question
of
the
cask
of
beer
but
he
made
it
but
i
will
say
this
that
a
better
preacher
nor
yet
one
to
stand
faster
by
his
rights
or
what
he
considered
to
be
his
rights--however
that's
not
the
question
now--i
for
one
never
set
under
some
might
say
'was
he
a
eloquent
man'
and
to
that
my
answer
would
be
'well
there
you've
a
better
right
per'aps
to
speak
of
your
own
uncle
than
what
i
have'
others
might
ask
'did
he
keep
a
hold
of
his
congregation'
and
there
again
i
should
reply
'that
depends'
but
as
i
say--yes
eliza
my
girl
i'm
coming--eleven
o'clock
sir
and
you
inquire
for
the
king's
head
pew
i
believe
eliza
had
been
very
near
the
door
and
shall
consider
it
in
my
vail
the
next
episode
was
church
i
felt
mr
lucas
had
a
difficult
task
in
doing
justice
to
christmas
sentiments
and
also
to
the
feeling
of
disquiet
and
regret
which
whatever
mr
bowman
might
say
was
clearly
prevalent
i
do
not
think
he
rose
to
the
occasion
i
was
uncomfortable
the
organ
wolved--you
know
what
i
mean
the
wind
died--twice
in
the
christmas
hymn
and
the
tenor
bell
i
suppose
owing
to
some
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
ringers
kept
sounding
faintly
about
once
in
a
minute
during
the
sermon
the
clerk
sent
up
a
man
to
see
to
it
but
he
seemed
unable
to
do
much
i
was
glad
when
it
was
over
there
was
an
odd
incident
too
before
the
service
i
went
in
rather
early
and
came
upon
two
men
carrying
the
parish
bier
back
to
its
place
under
the
tower
from
what
i
overheard
them
saying
it
appeared
that
it
had
been
put
out
by
mistake
by
some
one
who
was
not
there
i
also
saw
the
clerk
busy
folding
up
a
moth-eaten
velvet
pall--not
a
sight
for
christmas
day
i
dined
soon
after
this
and
then
feeling
disinclined
to
go
out
took
my
seat
by
the
fire
in
the
parlour
with
the
last
number
of
pickwick
which
i
had
been
saving
up
for
some
days
i
thought
i
could
be
sure
of
keeping
awake
over
this
but
i
turned
out
as
bad
as
our
friend
smith
i
suppose
it
was
half-past
two
when
i
was
roused
by
a
piercing
whistle
and
laughing
and
talking
voices
outside
in
the
market-place
it
was
a
punch
and
judy--i
had
no
doubt
the
one
that
my
bagman
had
seen
at
w----
i
was
half
delighted
half
not--the
latter
because
my
unpleasant
dream
came
back
to
me
so
vividly
but
anyhow
i
determined
to
see
it
through
and
i
sent
eliza
out
with
a
crown-piece
to
the
performers
and
a
request
that
they
would
face
my
window
if
they
could
manage
it
the
show
was
a
very
smart
new
one
the
names
of
the
proprietors
i
need
hardly
tell
you
were
italian
foresta
and
calpigi
the
toby
dog
was
there
as
i
had
been
led
to
expect
all
b----
turned
out
but
did
not
obstruct
my
view
for
i
was
at
the
large
first-floor
window
and
not
ten
yards
away
the
play
began
on
the
stroke
of
a
quarter
to
three
by
the
church
clock
certainly
it
was
very
good
and
i
was
soon
relieved
to
find
that
the
disgust
my
dream
had
given
me
for
punch's
onslaughts
on
his
ill-starred
visitors
was
only
transient
i
laughed
at
the
demise
of
the
turncock
the
foreigner
the
beadle
and
even
the
baby
the
only
drawback
was
the
toby
dog's
developing
a
tendency
to
howl
in
the
wrong
place
something
had
occurred
i
suppose
to
upset
him
and
something
considerable
for
i
forget
exactly
at
what
point
he
gave
a
most
lamentable
cry
leapt
off
the
foot
board
and
shot
away
across
the
market-place
and
down
a
side
street
there
was
a
stage-wait
but
only
a
brief
one
i
suppose
the
men
decided
that
it
was
no
good
going
after
him
and
that
he
was
likely
to
turn
up
again
at
night
we
went
on
punch
dealt
faithfully
with
judy
and
in
fact
with
all
comers
and
then
came
the
moment
when
the
gallows
was
erected
and
the
great
scene
with
mr
ketch
was
to
be
enacted
it
was
now
that
something
happened
of
which
i
can
certainly
not
yet
see
the
import
fully
you
have
witnessed
an
execution
and
know
what
the
criminal's
head
looks
like
with
the
cap
on
if
you
are
like
me
you
never
wish
to
think
of
it
again
and
i
do
not
willingly
remind
you
of
it
it
was
just
such
a
head
as
that
that
i
from
my
somewhat
higher
post
saw
in
the
inside
of
the
show-box
but
at
first
the
audience
did
not
see
it
i
expected
it
to
emerge
into
their
view
but
instead
of
that
there
slowly
rose
for
a
few
seconds
an
uncovered
face
with
an
expression
of
terror
upon
it
of
which
i
have
never
imagined
the
like
it
seemed
as
if
the
man
whoever
he
was
was
being
forcibly
lifted
with
his
arms
somehow
pinioned
or
held
back
towards
the
little
gibbet
on
the
stage
i
could
just
see
the
nightcapped
head
behind
him
then
there
was
a
cry
and
a
crash
the
whole
show-box
fell
over
backwards
kicking
legs
were
seen
among
the
ruins
and
then
two
figures--as
some
said
i
can
only
answer
for
one--were
visible
running
at
top
speed
across
the
square
and
disappearing
in
a
lane
which
leads
to
the
fields
of
course
everybody
gave
chase
i
followed
but
the
pace
was
killing
and
very
few
were
in
literally
at
the
death
it
happened
in
a
chalk
pit
the
man
went
over
the
edge
quite
blindly
and
broke
his
neck
they
searched
everywhere
for
the
other
until
it
occurred
to
me
to
ask
whether
he
had
ever
left
the
market-place
at
first
everyone
was
sure
that
he
had
but
when
we
came
to
look
he
was
there
under
the
show-box
dead
too
but
in
the
chalk
pit
it
was
that
poor
uncle
henry's
body
was
found
with
a
sack
over
the
head
the
throat
horribly
mangled
it
was
a
peaked
corner
of
the
sack
sticking
out
of
the
soil
that
attracted
attention
i
cannot
bring
myself
to
write
in
greater
detail
i
forgot
to
say
the
men's
real
names
were
kidman
and
gallop
i
feel
sure
i
have
heard
them
but
no
one
here
seems
to
know
anything
about
them
i
am
coming
to
you
as
soon
as
i
can
after
the
funeral
i
must
tell
you
when
we
meet
what
i
think
of
it
all
two
doctors
two
doctors
it
is
a
very
common
thing
in
my
experience
to
find
papers
shut
up
in
old
books
but
one
of
the
rarest
things
to
come
across
any
such
that
are
at
all
interesting
still
it
does
happen
and
one
should
never
destroy
them
unlooked
at
now
it
was
a
practice
of
mine
before
the
war
occasionally
to
buy
old
ledgers
of
which
the
paper
was
good
and
which
possessed
a
good
many
blank
leaves
and
to
extract
these
and
use
them
for
my
own
notes
and
writings
one
such
i
purchased
for
a
small
sum
in
1911
it
was
tightly
clasped
and
its
boards
were
warped
by
having
for
years
been
obliged
to
embrace
a
number
of
extraneous
sheets
three-quarters
of
this
inserted
matter
had
lost
all
vestige
of
importance
for
any
living
human
being
one
bundle
had
not
that
it
belonged
to
a
lawyer
is
certain
for
it
is
endorsed
the
strangest
case
i
have
yet
met
and
bears
initials
and
an
address
in
gray's
inn
it
is
only
materials
for
a
case
and
consists
of
statements
by
possible
witnesses
the
man
who
would
have
been
the
defendant
or
prisoner
seems
never
to
have
appeared
the
dossier
is
not
complete
but
such
as
it
is
it
furnishes
a
riddle
in
which
the
supernatural
appears
to
play
a
part
you
must
see
what
you
can
make
of
it
the
following
is
the
setting
and
the
tale
as
i
elicit
it
dr
abell
was
walking
in
his
garden
one
afternoon
waiting
for
his
horse
to
be
brought
round
that
he
might
set
out
on
his
visits
for
the
day
as
the
place
was
islington
the
month
june
and
the
year
1718
we
conceive
the
surroundings
as
being
countrified
and
pleasant
to
him
entered
his
confidential
servant
luke
jennett
who
had
been
with
him
twenty
years
i
said
i
wished
to
speak
to
him
and
what
i
had
to
say
might
take
some
quarter
of
an
hour
he
accordingly
bade
me
go
into
his
study
which
was
a
room
opening
on
the
terrace
path
where
he
was
walking
and
came
in
himself
and
sat
down
i
told
him
that
much
against
my
will
i
must
look
out
for
another
place
he
inquired
what
was
my
reason
in
consideration
i
had
been
so
long
with
him
i
said
if
he
would
excuse
me
he
would
do
me
a
great
kindness
because
this
appears
to
have
been
common
form
even
in
1718
i
was
one
that
always
liked
to
have
everything
pleasant
about
me
as
well
as
i
can
remember
he
said
that
was
his
case
likewise
but
he
would
wish
to
know
why
i
should
change
my
mind
after
so
many
years
and
says
he
'you
know
there
can
be
no
talk
of
a
remembrance
of
you
in
my
will
if
you
leave
my
service
now'
i
said
i
had
made
my
reckoning
of
that
'then'
says
he
'you
must
have
some
complaint
to
make
and
if
i
could
i
would
willingly
set
it
right'
and
at
that
i
told
him
not
seeing
how
i
could
keep
it
back
the
matter
of
my
former
affidavit
and
of
the
bedstaff
in
the
dispensing-room
and
said
that
a
house
where
such
things
happened
was
no
place
for
me
at
which
he
looking
very
black
upon
me
said
no
more
but
called
me
fool
and
said
he
would
pay
what
was
owing
me
in
the
morning
and
so
his
horse
being
waiting
went
out
so
for
that
night
i
lodged
with
my
sister's
husband
near
battle
bridge
and
came
early
next
morning
to
my
late
master
who
then
made
a
great
matter
that
i
had
not
lain
in
his
house
and
stopped
a
crown
out
of
my
wages
owing
after
that
i
took
service
here
and
there
not
for
long
at
a
time
and
saw
no
more
of
him
till
i
came
to
be
dr
quinn's
man
at
dodds
hall
in
islington
there
is
one
very
obscure
part
in
this
statement
namely
the
reference
to
the
former
affidavit
and
the
matter
of
the
bedstaff
the
former
affidavit
is
not
in
the
bundle
of
papers
it
is
to
be
feared
that
it
was
taken
out
to
be
read
because
of
its
special
oddity
and
not
put
back
of
what
nature
the
story
was
may
be
guessed
later
but
as
yet
no
clue
has
been
put
into
our
hands
the
rector
of
islington
jonathan
pratt
is
the
next
to
step
forward
he
furnishes
particulars
of
the
standing
and
reputation
of
dr
abell
and
dr
quinn
both
of
whom
lived
and
practised
in
his
parish
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
he
says
that
a
physician
should
be
a
regular
attendant
at
morning
and
evening
prayers
or
at
the
wednesday
lectures
but
within
the
measure
of
their
ability
i
would
say
that
both
these
persons
fulfilled
their
obligations
as
loyal
members
of
the
church
of
england
at
the
same
time
as
you
desire
my
private
mind
i
must
say
in
the
language
of
the
schools
distinguo
dr
a
was
to
me
a
source
of
perplexity
dr
q
to
my
eye
a
plain
honest
believer
not
inquiring
over
closely
into
points
of
belief
but
squaring
his
practice
to
what
lights
he
had
the
other
interested
himself
in
questions
to
which
providence
as
i
hold
designs
no
answer
to
be
given
us
in
this
state
he
would
ask
me
for
example
what
place
i
believed
those
beings
now
to
hold
in
the
scheme
of
creation
which
by
some
are
thought
neither
to
have
stood
fast
when
the
rebel
angels
fell
nor
to
have
joined
with
them
to
the
full
pitch
of
their
transgression
as
was
suitable
my
first
answer
to
him
was
a
question
what
warrant
he
had
for
supposing
any
such
beings
to
exist
for
that
there
was
none
in
scripture
i
took
it
he
was
aware
it
appeared--for
as
i
am
on
the
subject
the
whole
tale
may
be
given--that
he
grounded
himself
on
such
passages
as
that
of
the
satyr
which
jerome
tells
us
conversed
with
antony
but
thought
too
that
some
parts
of
scripture
might
be
cited
in
support
'and
besides'
said
he
'you
know
'tis
the
universal
belief
among
those
that
spend
their
days
and
nights
abroad
and
i
would
add
that
if
your
calling
took
you
so
continuously
as
it
does
me
about
the
country
lanes
by
night
you
might
not
be
so
surprised
as
i
see
you
to
be
by
my
suggestion'
'you
are
then
of
john
milton's
mind'
i
said
'and
hold
that
millions
of
spiritual
creatures
walk
the
earth
unseen
both
when
we
wake
and
when
we
sleep'
'i
do
not
know'
he
said
'why
milton
should
take
upon
himself
to
say
unseen
though
to
be
sure
he
was
blind
when
he
wrote
that
but
for
the
rest
why
yes
i
think
he
was
in
the
right'
'well'
i
said
'though
not
so
often
as
you
i
am
not
seldom
called
abroad
pretty
late
but
i
have
no
mind
of
meeting
a
satyr
in
our
islington
lanes
in
all
the
years
i
have
been
here
and
if
you
have
had
the
better
luck
i
am
sure
the
royal
society
would
be
glad
to
know
of
it'
i
am
reminded
of
these
trifling
expressions
because
dr
a
took
them
so
ill
stamping
out
of
the
room
in
a
huff
with
some
such
word
as
that
these
high
and
dry
parsons
had
no
eyes
but
for
a
prayerbook
or
a
pint
of
wine
but
this
was
not
the
only
time
that
our
conversation
took
a
remarkable
turn
there
was
an
evening
when
he
came
in
at
first
seeming
gay
and
in
good
spirits
but
afterwards
as
he
sat
and
smoked
by
the
fire
falling
into
a
musing
way
out
of
which
to
rouse
him
i
said
pleasantly
that
i
supposed
he
had
had
no
meetings
of
late
with
his
odd
friends
a
question
which
did
effectually
arouse
him
for
he
looked
most
wildly
and
as
if
scared
upon
me
and
said
'you
were
never
there
i
did
not
see
you
who
brought
you'
and
then
in
a
more
collected
tone
'what
was
this
about
a
meeting
i
believe
i
must
have
been
in
a
doze'
to
which
i
answered
that
i
was
thinking
of
fauns
and
centaurs
in
the
dark
lane
and
not
of
a
witches'
sabbath
but
it
seemed
he
took
it
differently
'well'
said
he
'i
can
plead
guilty
to
neither
but
i
find
you
very
much
more
of
a
sceptic
than
becomes
your
cloth
if
you
care
to
know
about
the
dark
lane
you
might
do
worse
than
ask
my
housekeeper
that
lived
at
the
other
end
of
it
when
she
was
a
child'
'yes'
said
i
'and
the
old
women
in
the
almshouse
and
the
children
in
the
kennel
if
i
were
you
i
would
send
to
your
brother
quinn
for
a
bolus
to
clear
your
brain'
'damn
quinn'
says
he
'talk
no
more
of
him
he
has
embezzled
four
of
my
best
patients
this
month
i
believe
it
is
that
cursed
man
of
his
jennett
that
used
to
be
with
me
his
tongue
is
never
still
it
should
be
nailed
to
the
pillory
if
he
had
his
deserts'
this
i
may
say
was
the
only
time
of
his
showing
me
that
he
had
any
grudge
against
either
dr
quinn
or
jennett
and
as
was
my
business
i
did
my
best
to
persuade
him
he
was
mistaken
in
them
yet
it
could
not
be
denied
that
some
respectable
families
in
the
parish
had
given
him
the
cold
shoulder
and
for
no
reason
that
they
were
willing
to
allege
the
end
was
that
he
said
he
had
not
done
so
ill
at
islington
but
that
he
could
afford
to
live
at
ease
elsewhere
when
he
chose
and
anyhow
he
bore
dr
quinn
no
malice
i
think
i
now
remember
what
observation
of
mine
drew
him
into
the
train
of
thought
which
he
next
pursued
it
was
i
believe
my
mentioning
some
juggling
tricks
which
my
brother
in
the
east
indies
had
seen
at
the
court
of
the
rajah
of
mysore
'a
convenient
thing
enough'
said
dr
abell
to
me
'if
by
some
arrangement
a
man
could
get
the
power
of
communicating
motion
and
energy
to
inanimate
objects'
'as
if
the
axe
should
move
itself
against
him
that
lifts
it
something
of
that
kind'
'well
i
don't
know
that
that
was
in
my
mind
so
much
but
if
you
could
summon
such
a
volume
from
your
shelf
or
even
order
it
to
open
at
the
right
page'
he
was
sitting
by
the
fire--it
was
a
cold
evening--and
stretched
out
his
hand
that
way
and
just
then
the
fire-irons
or
at
least
the
poker
fell
over
towards
him
with
a
great
clatter
and
i
did
not
hear
what
else
he
said
but
i
told
him
that
i
could
not
easily
conceive
of
an
arrangement
as
he
called
it
of
such
a
kind
that
would
not
include
as
one
of
its
conditions
a
heavier
payment
than
any
christian
would
care
to
make
to
which
he
assented
'but'
he
said
'i
have
no
doubt
these
bargains
can
be
made
very
tempting
very
persuasive
still
you
would
not
favour
them
eh
doctor
no
i
suppose
not'
this
is
as
much
as
i
know
of
dr
abell's
mind
and
the
feeling
between
these
men
dr
quinn
as
i
said
was
a
plain
honest
creature
and
a
man
to
whom
i
would
have
gone--indeed
i
have
before
now
gone
to
him
for
advice
on
matters
of
business
he
was
however
every
now
and
again
and
particularly
of
late
not
exempt
from
troublesome
fancies
there
was
certainly
a
time
when
he
was
so
much
harassed
by
his
dreams
that
he
could
not
keep
them
to
himself
but
would
tell
them
to
his
acquaintances
and
among
them
to
me
i
was
at
supper
at
his
house
and
he
was
not
inclined
to
let
me
leave
him
at
my
usual
time
'if
you
go'
he
said
'there
will
be
nothing
for
it
but
i
must
go
to
bed
and
dream
of
the
chrysalis'
'you
might
be
worse
off'
said
i
'i
do
not
think
it'
he
said
and
he
shook
himself
like
a
man
who
is
displeased
with
the
complexion
of
his
thoughts
'i
only
meant'
said
i
'that
a
chrysalis
is
an
innocent
thing'
'this
one
is
not'
he
said
'and
i
do
not
care
to
think
of
it'
however
sooner
than
lose
my
company
he
was
fain
to
tell
me
for
i
pressed
him
that
this
was
a
dream
which
had
come
to
him
several
times
of
late
and
even
more
than
once
in
a
night
it
was
to
this
effect
that
he
seemed
to
himself
to
wake
under
an
extreme
compulsion
to
rise
and
go
out
of
doors
so
he
would
dress
himself
and
go
down
to
his
garden
door
by
the
door
there
stood
a
spade
which
he
must
take
and
go
out
into
the
garden
and
at
a
particular
place
in
the
shrubbery
somewhat
clear
and
upon
which
the
moon
shone
for
there
was
always
in
his
dream
a
full
moon
he
would
feel
himself
forced
to
dig
and
after
some
time
the
spade
would
uncover
something
light-coloured
which
he
would
perceive
to
be
a
stuff
linen
or
woollen
and
this
he
must
clear
with
his
hands
it
was
always
the
same
of
the
size
of
a
man
and
shaped
like
the
chrysalis
of
a
moth
with
the
folds
showing
a
promise
of
an
opening
at
one
end
he
could
not
describe
how
gladly
he
would
have
left
all
at
this
stage
and
run
to
the
house
but
he
must
not
escape
so
easily
so
with
many
groans
and
knowing
only
too
well
what
to
expect
he
parted
these
folds
of
stuff
or
as
it
sometimes
seemed
to
be
membrane
and
disclosed
a
head
covered
with
a
smooth
pink
skin
which
breaking
as
the
creature
stirred
showed
him
his
own
face
in
a
state
of
death
the
telling
of
this
so
much
disturbed
him
that
i
was
forced
out
of
mere
compassion
to
sit
with
him
the
greater
part
of
the
night
and
talk
with
him
upon
indifferent
subjects
he
said
that
upon
every
recurrence
of
this
dream
he
woke
and
found
himself
as
it
were
fighting
for
his
breath
another
extract
from
luke
jennett's
long
continuous
statement
comes
in
at
this
point
i
never
told
tales
of
my
master
dr
abell
to
anybody
in
the
neighbourhood
when
i
was
in
another
service
i
remember
to
have
spoken
to
my
fellow-servants
about
the
matter
of
the
bedstaff
but
i
am
sure
i
never
said
either
i
or
he
were
the
persons
concerned
and
it
met
with
so
little
credit
that
i
was
affronted
and
thought
best
to
keep
it
to
myself
and
when
i
came
back
to
islington
and
found
dr
abell
still
there
who
i
was
told
had
left
the
parish
i
was
clear
that
it
behoved
me
to
use
great
discretion
for
indeed
i
was
afraid
of
the
man
and
it
is
certain
i
was
no
party
to
spreading
any
ill
report
of
him
my
master
dr
quinn
was
a
very
just
honest
man
and
no
maker
of
mischief
i
am
sure
he
never
stirred
a
finger
nor
said
a
word
by
way
of
inducement
to
a
soul
to
make
them
leave
going
to
dr
abell
and
come
to
him
nay
he
would
hardly
be
persuaded
to
attend
them
that
came
until
he
was
convinced
that
if
he
did
not
they
would
send
into
the
town
for
a
physician
rather
than
do
as
they
had
hitherto
done
i
believe
it
may
be
proved
that
dr
abell
came
into
my
master's
house
more
than
once
we
had
a
new
chambermaid
out
of
hertfordshire
and
she
asked
me
who
was
the
gentleman
that
was
looking
after
the
master
that
is
dr
quinn
when
he
was
out
and
seemed
so
disappointed
that
he
was
out
she
said
whoever
he
was
he
knew
the
way
of
the
house
well
running
at
once
into
the
study
and
then
into
the
dispensing-room
and
last
into
the
bed-chamber
i
made
her
tell
me
what
he
was
like
and
what
she
said
was
suitable
enough
to
dr
abell
but
besides
she
told
me
she
saw
the
same
man
at
church
and
some
one
told
her
that
was
the
doctor
it
was
just
after
this
that
my
master
began
to
have
his
bad
nights
and
complained
to
me
and
other
persons
and
in
particular
what
discomfort
he
suffered
from
his
pillow
and
bedclothes
he
said
he
must
buy
some
to
suit
him
and
should
do
his
own
marketing
and
accordingly
brought
home
a
parcel
which
he
said
was
of
the
right
quality
but
where
he
bought
it
we
had
then
no
knowledge
only
they
were
marked
in
thread
with
a
coronet
and
a
bird
the
women
said
they
were
of
a
sort
not
commonly
met
with
and
very
fine
and
my
master
said
they
were
the
comfortablest
he
ever
used
and
he
slept
now
both
soft
and
deep
also
the
feather
pillows
were
the
best
sorted
and
his
head
would
sink
into
them
as
if
they
were
a
cloud
which
i
have
myself
remarked
several
times
when
i
came
to
wake
him
of
a
morning
his
face
being
almost
hid
by
the
pillow
closing
over
it
i
had
never
any
communication
with
dr
abell
after
i
came
back
to
islington
but
one
day
when
he
passed
me
in
the
street
and
asked
me
whether
i
was
not
looking
for
another
service
to
which
i
answered
i
was
very
well
suited
where
i
was
but
he
said
i
was
a
tickle-minded
fellow
and
he
doubted
not
he
should
soon
hear
i
was
on
the
world
again
which
indeed
proved
true
dr
pratt
is
next
taken
up
where
he
left
off
on
the
16th
i
was
called
up
out
of
my
bed
soon
after
it
was
light--that
is
about
five--with
a
message
that
dr
quinn
was
dead
or
dying
making
my
way
to
his
house
i
found
there
was
no
doubt
which
was
the
truth
all
the
persons
in
the
house
except
the
one
that
let
me
in
were
already
in
his
chamber
and
standing
about
his
bed
but
none
touching
him
he
was
stretched
in
the
midst
of
the
bed
on
his
back
without
any
disorder
and
indeed
had
the
appearance
of
one
ready
laid
out
for
burial
his
hands
i
think
were
even
crossed
on
his
breast
the
only
thing
not
usual
was
that
nothing
was
to
be
seen
of
his
face
the
two
ends
of
the
pillow
or
bolster
appearing
to
be
closed
quite
over
it
these
i
immediately
pulled
apart
at
the
same
time
rebuking
those
present
and
especially
the
man
for
not
at
once
coming
to
the
assistance
of
his
master
he
however
only
looked
at
me
and
shook
his
head
having
evidently
no
more
hope
than
myself
that
there
was
anything
but
a
corpse
before
us
indeed
it
was
plain
to
any
one
possessed
of
the
least
experience
that
he
was
not
only
dead
but
had
died
of
suffocation
nor
could
it
be
conceived
that
his
death
was
accidentally
caused
by
the
mere
folding
of
the
pillow
over
his
face
how
should
he
not
feeling
the
oppression
have
lifted
his
hands
to
put
it
away
whereas
not
a
fold
of
the
sheet
which
was
closely
gathered
about
him
as
i
now
observed
was
disordered
the
next
thing
was
to
procure
a
physician
i
had
bethought
me
of
this
on
leaving
my
house
and
sent
on
the
messenger
who
had
come
to
me
to
dr
abell
but
i
now
heard
that
he
was
away
from
home
and
the
nearest
surgeon
was
got
who
however
could
tell
no
more
at
least
without
opening
the
body
than
we
already
knew
as
to
any
person
entering
the
room
with
evil
purpose
which
was
the
next
point
to
be
cleared
it
was
visible
that
the
bolts
of
the
door
were
burst
from
their
stanchions
and
the
stanchions
broken
away
from
the
door-post
by
main
force
and
there
was
a
sufficient
body
of
witness
the
smith
among
them
to
testify
that
this
had
been
done
but
a
few
minutes
before
i
came
the
chamber
being
moreover
at
the
top
of
the
house
the
window
was
neither
easy
of
access
nor
did
it
show
any
sign
of
an
exit
made
that
way
either
by
marks
upon
the
sill
or
footprints
below
upon
soft
mould
the
surgeon's
evidence
forms
of
course
part
of
the
report
of
the
inquest
but
since
it
has
nothing
but
remarks
upon
the
healthy
state
of
the
larger
organs
and
the
coagulation
of
blood
in
various
parts
of
the
body
it
need
not
be
reproduced
the
verdict
was
death
by
the
visitation
of
god
annexed
to
the
other
papers
is
one
which
i
was
at
first
inclined
to
suppose
had
made
its
way
among
them
by
mistake
upon
further
consideration
i
think
i
can
divine
a
reason
for
its
presence
it
relates
to
the
rifling
of
a
mausoleum
in
middlesex
which
stood
in
a
park
now
broken
up
the
property
of
a
noble
family
which
i
will
not
name
the
outrage
was
not
that
of
an
ordinary
resurrection
man
the
object
it
seemed
likely
was
theft
the
account
is
blunt
and
terrible
i
shall
not
quote
it
a
dealer
in
the
north
of
london
suffered
heavy
penalties
as
a
receiver
of
stolen
goods
in
connexion
with
the
affair
