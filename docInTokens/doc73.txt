a
drab
gray
sheet
of
cloud
slipped
stealthily
from
the
moon's
round
face
like
a
shroud
slipping
from
the
face
of
one
long
dead
a
coldly
phosphorescent
face
from
which
the
eyes
had
been
plucked
yellow
radiance
fell
toward
a
calm
oily
sea
seeking
a
narrow
bank
of
fog
lying
low
on
the
water
penetrating
its
somber
mass
like
frozen
yellow
fingers
vilma
bradley
shuddered
and
shrank
against
clifford
darrell's
brawny
form
it's--it's
ghastly
cliff
she
said
ghastly
darrell
leaned
against
the
rail
laughing
softly
one
cocktail
too
many--that's
the
answer
it's
given
you
the
jitters
listen
faintly
from
the
salon
came
strains
of
dance
music
and
the
rhythmic
shuffle
of
feet
a
nifty
yacht
a
south
sea
moon
a
radio
dance
orchestra
dancers--and
little
clifford
and
you
call
it
ghastly
almost
savagely
his
arms
tightened
about
her
and
the
bantering
note
left
his
voice
i'm
crazy
about
you
vilma
she
tried
to
laugh
but
it
was
an
unconvincing
sound
it's
the
moon
cliff--i
guess
i
never
saw
it
like
that
before
something's
going
to
happen--something
dreadful
i
just
know
it
oh--be
sensible
vilma
there
was
a
hint
of
impatience
in
cliff's
deep
voice
a
gorgeous
girl
in
his
arms--dark-haired
dark-eyed
made
for
love--and
she
talked
of
dreadful
things
which
were
going
to
happen
because
the
moon
looked
screwy
she
released
herself
and
glanced
out
over
the
sea
i
know
i'm
silly
but----
her
voice
froze
and
her
slender
body
stiffened
cliff--look
darrell
spun
around
and
as
he
stared
he
felt
a
dryness
seeping
into
his
throat
choking
him
out
of
the
winding-sheet
of
fog
into
the
moonlight
crept
a
strange
strange
craft
her
crumbling
timbers
blackened
and
rotted
with
incredible
age
the
corpse
of
a
ship
she
seemed
resurrected
from
the
grave
of
the
sea
her
prow
thrust
upward
like
a
scimitar
bent
backward
hovering
over
the
gaunt
ruin
of
a
cabin
whose
seaward
sides
were
formed
by
port
and
starboard
bows
from
a
shallow
pit
amidships
jutted
the
broken
arm
of
a
mast
its
splintered
tip
pointing
toward
the
blindly
watching
moon
the
stern
thickly
covered
with
the
moldering
encrustations
of
age
curved
inward
above
the
strange
high
poop
beneath
which
lay
another
cabin
and
along
either
side
of
her
worm-eaten
freeboard
ran
a
row
of
apertures
like
oblong
portholes
out
of
these
projected
great
oars
long
unwieldy
as
somberly
black
as
the
rest
of
the
ancient
hulk
now
a
sound
drifted
across
the
waters
the
steady
rhythmic
br-rr-oom
br-rr-oom
br-rr-oom
of
a
drum
beating
time
for
the
rowers
its
hollow
thud
checked
the
heart
set
it
to
throbbing
in
tempo
with
its
own
weary
pulse
ghostly
fingers
dripping
dread
crawled
up
darrell's
spine
stiff-lipped
vilma
gasped
what--what
is
it
cliff
answered
in
a
dry
husky
voice
the
words
seeming
to
trip
over
an
awkward
tongue
it's--it's--it
can't
be
damn
it--but
it's
a
galley
a
ship
from
the
days
of
alexander
the
great
what's
it
doing--here--now
closer
she
came
through
the
moon-path
a
frothing
lip
of
brine
curling
away
from
her
swelling
prow
closer--her
course
crossing
that
of
the
ariel--and
the
watchers
saw
her
crew
they
gasped
and
the
blood
ebbed
from
their
faces
men
of
ancient
persia
clad
in
leather
kirtles
and
rusted
armor
and
they
were
hideous
in
the
yellow
moon-glow
cliff
could
see
them
clearly
now--a
lookout
standing
motionless
in
the
stem
the
steersman
on
the
poop-deck
the
drummer
squatting
beside
the
broken
mast
the
rowers
in
the
pit--and
all
all
were
a
bloodless
white
the
skin
of
their
faces
puffed
and
bloated
and
horribly
wrinkled
like
flesh
that
had
been
under
water
a
long
time
dead
men

men
whose
movements
were
stiffly
wooden

as
dead
as
their
faces
but
most
horrible
was
the
fact
that
they
were
there
that
they
moved
at
all





a
queer
mirage
isn't
it
a
hollow
voice
spoke
suavely
behind
them
vilma
gasped
at
the
sudden
sound
and
they
whirled
a
foot
away
stood
the
tall
lean
figure
of
the
ariel's
captain
leon
corio
a
queer
smile
twisted
his
thin
lips
what's
the
idea--sneaking
up
on
us
darrell
demanded
angrily
he
didn't
like
this
man
hadn't
liked
him
from
the
moment
he
had
approached
cliff
to
sell
him
the
yacht
but
cliff
had
bought
the
craft
because
she
was
a
bargain
and
in
accordance
with
their
agreement
he
had
hired
corio
as
captain
the
tall
man's
smile
remained
fixed
and
he
bowed
gravely
sorry
sir
i
always
walk
softly
a
habit
i
suppose
he
gestured
toward
the
galley
it
looks
quite
life-like
don't
you
think
so
life-like
cliff
spoke
between
his
teeth
as
he
again
faced
the
black
ship
it
looks
dead
to
me
the
galley
had
almost
reached
them
now
veering
sharply
to
draw
up
beside
the
ariel
the
drum
quieted
and
the
oars
trailed
in
the
water
motionless
except
for
the
swaying
imparted
by
the
waves
a
musty
age-old
odor
filtered
through
the
air
like
a
breath
from
a
grave
the
music
and
dancing
had
stopped
a
fear-filled
hush
shrouded
the
yacht
vilma
drew
cliff's
arm
about
her
shoulder
he
glanced
back
at
the
motionless
captain
do
something
corio
he
rasped
don't
stand
there
like
a
dummy
corio
nodded
with
his
same
queer
smile
his
hand
darted
to
an
inside
pocket
came
out
bearing
a
curious
instrument
like
four
twisted
cones
of
silver
bound
together
with
silver
thongs
as
he
raised
this
to
his
mouth
his
eyelids
were
slits
behind
which
burned
the
embers
of
his
eyes
out
over
the
sea
crept
a
single
note
deep
hollow
laden
with
eery
minor
wailings--a
sound
that
summoned
imperatively
yet
a
sound
that
repelled
it
was
a
moan
hideous
as
the
moan
of
a
dying
demon
it
raked
the
heart
with
fear-tipped
claws
it
rose
and
fell
and
rose
again
and
as
it
died
it
awakened
the
crew
of
the
ancient
galley
to
motion
sweeping
them
in
a
horde
to
the
rail
of
the
yacht
cliff
swung
toward
corio
in
bursting
fury
fury
mingled
with
dread
his
fist
lashed
out
at
that
glittering
silver
instrument
and
the
face
behind
it
but
corio
avoided
him
like
a
wraith
still
smiling
fixedly
the
horn
again
at
his
lips
cliff
cursed
and
hurled
himself
through
the
air
one
hand
caught
a
bony
shoulder
he
felt
fingers
like
hooks
close
on
his
own
throat
he
wrenched
free
landing
a
stunning
blow
on
corio's
face--saw
him
reel
and
crash
to
the
deck--and
then
he
heard
vilma
scream
he
whirled
she
was
struggling
between
two
of
the
flabby-faced
things
from
the
galley
in
an
instant
he
was
upon
them
his
fist
thudding
against
icy
flesh
burying
itself
in
something
horribly
soft
and
yielding
startled
cliff
swung
a
second
blow
and
an
arm
tomb-cold
and
strong
as
the
tentacle
of
an
octopus
wrapped
itself
around
him--a
vise
of
thin-covered
bone
a
dead
drowned
face
peered
over
his
shoulder
staring
blankly
other
arms
seized
his
legs
and
though
he
struggled
and
writhed
with
the
strength
of
a
mounting
fear
he
was
borne
to
the
rail
over
they
went
and
dropped
to
the
rotting
deck
of
the
galley
a
numbness
was
creeping
through
him
like
a
contagion
spreading
from
those
crushing
hands
of
ice
his
struggles
ceased
with
eyes
that
turned
stiffly
in
their
sockets
he
looked
for
vilma
saw
her
raised
high
above
the
heads
of
two
other
pallid
creatures
saw
them
climb
over
the
rail
then
the
blackness
of
a
dank
and
musty
cabin
enveloped
him
and
he
was
dropped
with
jarring
force
his
captors
bulked
black
against
the
moonlit
doorway
treading
soundlessly
and
were
gone
cliff
lay
in
rigid
paralysis
every
sense
keenly
alive
his
mind
striving
to
clutch
a
single
spar
of
reason
in
this
chaotic
whirlpool
of
the
incredible
this
couldn't
be
soon
he'd
awaken
to
laugh
at
his
absurd
nightmare
yet
it
seemed
horribly
real
it
was
real
from
the
ariel
boiled
a
fearful
bedlam
screams
of
terror
curses
then
other
shadows
loomed
in
the
doorway
and
vilma
motionless
and
rigid
was
dropped
brutally
beside
him
on
the
spongy
floor
furiously
cliff
struggled
against
the
maddening
restraint
of
paralysis
he
couldn't
lie
here
helpless
vilma
needed
him
he'd--he'd
have
to
do
something
with
an
effort
that
studded
his
forehead
with
rounded
drops
of
sweat
and
sent
the
blood
throbbing
through
the
distended
veins
of
his
neck
he
sought
to
move
and
like
a
cord
snapping
his
invisible
bonds
fell
from
him
he
was
crouching
over
vilma
rubbing
her
wrists
calling
to
her
when
again
he
heard
the
silver
horn
of
corio
a
low
droning
utterly
unlike
the
note
that
had
awakened
the
galley's
crew
it
drifted
languidly
along
a
channel
of
endless
sleep
it
seeped
through
the
ear-drums
touching
every
nerve-tip
with
resistless
lassitude
doggedly
cliff
fought
against
the
sound
pressing
his
hands
over
his
ears
gritting
his
teeth
holding
his
eyelids
wide
yet
he
felt
his
muscles
weaken
began
to
relax
knew
dimly
that
his
mind
sodden
with
drowsiness
was
creeping
toward
the
pits
of
slumber--and
the
vibrant
drone
ended





his
head
cleared
rapidly
and
he
bent
over
vilma
as
he
touched
a
limp
arm
he
knew
she
had
passed
from
paralysis
into
a
deep
quiet
sleep
he
shook
her
it
was
useless
he
listened
heard
her
steady
breathing
and
at
that
instant
realized
that
the
noises
from
the
yacht
had
ceased
rising
he
strode
toward
the
square
of
chalky
moonlight
a
foot
away
he
halted
fell
back
he
had
heard
a
faint
footfall
had
seen
an
armor-clad
figure
climbing
over
the
rail
with
silent
haste
he
flung
himself
down
beside
vilma
and
there
he
lay
while
the
crew
of
the
galley
carried
his
friends
from
the
ariel
all
slumped
in
that
unnatural
sleep
and
stretched
them
out
on
the
floor
of
the
black
cabin
unmoving
he
watched
through
narrow
lids
till
all
save
corio
had
been
carried
aboard
and
the
drowned
things
had
gone
back
to
their
places
in
the
rowers'
pits
again
the
hollow
voice
of
the
drum
began
throbbing
through
the
silence
and
the
oars
creaked
a
faint
accompaniment
he
could
feel
the
galley
cleaving
the
oily
sea
on
his
feet
he
peered
through
the
doorway
the
backs
of
the
rowers
rose
and
fell
with
stiff
mechanical
rhythm
beyond
the
galley's
stern
came
the
yacht
slinking
along
like
a
thief
only
one
dim
light
showing
her
diesel
engines
purring
almost
soundlessly
he
turned
and
bent
over
vilma
still
in
thrall
to
that
strange
deep
slumber
as
he
traced
the
delicate
outlines
of
her
lovely
face
now
so
lifeless
and
pale
bitter
wrath
flared
within
him
wrath
and
hatred
for
leon
corio
but
as
he
thought
of
the
ghastly
undead
things
out
there
in
the
galley
pit
thought
of
this
water-soaked
anachronism
which
had
no
right
to
be
afloat
his
skin
crisped
with
a
sense
of
foreboding
a
fear
of
what
was
yet
to
come
he
must
do
something
stepping
over
the
still
forms
of
his
friends
he
moved
to
the
forward
wall
where
a
beam
of
radiance
crept
fearfully
through
a
gap
between
two
boards
his
hands
touched
the
hull--and
he
jerked
them
away
rotten
clammy
like
a
decayed
corpse
partly
frozen
crouching
he
peered
through
far
ahead
a
blotch
of
evil
blackness
squatted
on
the
horizon
an
island
crouching
low
like
a
black
beast
ready
to
spring
around
it
the
moonlight
seemed
to
dim
as
though
it
were
striving
to
hide
some
nameless
horror
interminably
cliff
watched
while
the
shadowed
mass
drew
closer

closer
they
were
headed
for
a
towering
wall
of
black
basalt
and
as
the
galley
neared
it
cliff
saw
that
it
bore
striking
resemblance
to
a
gigantic
human
skull
its
rounded
surface
broken
by
caves
that
the
sea
had
carved
into
hollow
eye-sockets
and
an
empty
nasal
cavity
the
rock
wall
ended
high
above
the
water
beneath
it
lay
a
gaping
chasm
of
pitchy
darkness
and
the
galley
drum
silenced
oars
at
rest
slid
under
the
ledge
into
the
mouth
of
the
skull
just
before
total
blackness
fell
cliff
sprang
to
vilma's
side
and
raised
her
in
his
arms
if
he
hoped
to
do
anything
he
must
do
it
now
he
groped
his
way
to
the
starboard
bow
and
moved
one
hand
along
the
dank
timbers
searching
he
found
what
he
sought
a
wide
gap
at
the
edge
of
a
board
gently
lowering
vilma
to
the
floor
he
gripped
the
slimy
wood
with
both
hands
and
thrust
outward
mightily
a
wide
strip
of
decayed
timber
burst
free
he
dropped
it
into
the
sea
and
attacked
the
next
board
in
moments
a
wide
irregular
opening
yawned
in
the
galley's
hull
leaning
out
cliff
looked
down
he
could
see
nothing
then
suddenly
a
faint
light
appeared
and
he
heard
the
hum
of
the
ariel's
motors
as
she
entered
the
cave
the
humming
ceased
instantly
but
the
faint
light
persisted
now
he
could
see
the
blackness
of
waters
a
rock
wall
beyond
he
drew
back--and
a
he
did
so
he
heard
movements
on
deck
at
any
moment
the
rowers
might
enter
he'd
have
to
risk
a
drop
into
the
water
with
vilma--there
was
nothing
else
to
do
if
only
she
were
conscious
he
stooped
and
raised
her
holding
her
firmly
with
one
arm
gripping
the
hull
with
the
other
he
climbed
through
the
opening
inhaled
deeply
and
dropped
a
heart-stopping
plunge--and
cold
water
closed
over
them
down
down--then
they
shot
upward
reached
the
surface
and
even
as
cliff
gulped
a
single
gasping
breath
something
struck
his
skull
a
blinding
stunning
blow
the
oars
with
rapidly
numbing
arms
and
legs
cliff
kicked
and
flailed
the
water
striving
for
land
dimly
he
knew
he
no
longer
held
vilma
dimly
he
visioned
her
as
were
those
ghastly
undead
then
his
body
scraped
on
something
hard
and
a
blackness
that
was
not
physical
blotted
out
consciousness
2
the
dreadful
isle
red-hot
hammers
pounding
against
his
temples
wakened
cliff
darrell
he
opened
his
eyes
to
stare
into
total
darkness
crawling
with
mental
monsters
spawned
by
his
pain-stabbed
brain
he
lay
half
immersed
in
shallow
brine
his
head
resting
on
a
jagged
stone
just
above
the
surface
struggling
to
his
hands
and
knees
he
shook
his
head
from
side
to
side
dumbly
like
an
animal
in
pain
something
had
hit
him--and
now
he
was
in
water--and
there
was
no
light
what
had
happened
where
was
vilma
vilma
he
groaned
he
remembered
now
they
had
dropped--and
his
head
had
struck
something--and--and--maybe
she
was
floating
out
there
even
now
dead
eyes
staring
upward
vilma
he
cried
his
voice
pleading
vilma
only
a
mocking
echo
answered
him
there
was
no
other
sound
not
even
the
whisper
of
waves
swishing
among
the
rocks
cliff
pressed
his
hands
fiercely
against
his
throbbing
head
the
pain
had
become
a
madness
matched
only
by
the
agony
of
his
own
helplessness
he
felt
his
reason
reeling
he
fought
an
insane
desire
to
fling
himself
shrieking
into
that
silent
expanse
of
water
to
search
for
vilma
then
with
a
tremendous
physical
effort
he
jarred
himself
back
to
sanity
he
staggered
to
his
feet
groped
stumblingly
over
the
rocks
away
from
the
water
his
hand
touched
a
rock
wall
broken
and
pitted
by
the
action
of
the
sea
and
he
crept
slowly
inland
feeling
his
way
like
a
blind
man
as
he
plodded
on
his
thoughts
blended
into
one
fixed
idea
he
must
get
to
light
must
get
light
to
search
for
vilma
gradually
the
insensate
pounding
in
his
head
abated
and
strength
returned
to
his
body
when
at
last
he
saw
light
beyond
a
narrow
fissure
around
an
angle
in
the
cavern
he
had
almost
recovered
in
moments
he
was
gazing
out
over
a
plain
bathed
in
the
glow
of
a
leprous
moon
as
he
stared
he
shivered
and
it
was
not
because
of
the
cold
draft
drawing
through
the
fissure
fanning
his
brine-drenched
body
grim
and
starkly
forbidding
the
plain
lay
before
him
dead
as
the
frozen
landscape
of
the
moon
once
there
had
been
life
there
but
now
only
the
skeletons
of
trees
remained
lifting
their
wasted
limbs
in
rigid
pleading
to
an
unresponsive
sky
some
there
were
that
had
fallen
uprooted
by
the
fury
of
passing
hurricanes
these
lay
like
the
scattered
bones
of
a
dismembered
giant
age-blackened
and
painted
with
hoarfrost
by
the
brushes
of
moonlight
feebly
the
dead
forest
stirred
under
the
touch
of
a
moaning
wind
and
the
gaunt
shadows
cast
by
the
trees
seemed
to
be
multi-armed
monsters
slithering
over
the
rocky
earth
he
looked
beyond
the
trees
and
he
saw
light
little
squares
of
pale
radiance
cut
high
in
the
walls
of
an
ancient
black
castle
castle
cliff
frowned
he
could
liken
it
to
nothing
else
though
he
could
not
recall
ever
having
seen
a
castle
which
thrust
curving
needle-thin
spires
into
the
sky
like
a
devil's
horns
impatiently
cliff
stepped
from
the
wall
of
rock
and
glanced
along
a
path
that
writhed
through
the
forest
glanced--and
crouched
swiftly
a
low
cry
escaping
him
a
single
spot
of
water
on
a
smooth
flat
stone
a
spot
shaped
like
a
woman's
shoe
vilma
had
passed
this
way
but--might
it
not
have
been
some
other
woman
from
the
ariel
no
they
had
been
carried--and
even
if
they
had
walked
their
feet
were
dry
like
a
hound
on
the
scent
cliff
darrell
sped
along
the
serpentine
path
the
wind
moaned
above
him
and
the
soughing
branches
seemed
to
whisper
croaking
warnings
but
he
ran
on
his
eyes
constantly
seeking
signs
of
vilma's
course
here
a
drop
of
water
shaken
from
her
drenched
skirt
there
another
and
cliff
blessed
the
full
moon
whose
light
made
possible
his
trailing
of
the
almost
invisible
spoor
now
he
had
passed
beyond
the
dead
forest
and
was
moving
toward
the
castle
the
trail
had
been
growing
steadily
fainter
but
he
managed
to
follow
it
it
led
him
toward
a
narrow
stone
stairway
climbing
crookedly
to
a
misshapen
opening
in
the
wall
light
glowed
faintly
lurid
somewhere
deep
within
and
now
cliff
heard
a
blasphemous
sound
belch
from
the
depths
of
the
castle--a
wheezing
sardonic
croaking
like
the
moan
of
a
demoniac
organ
rumbling
an
obscene
dirge
his
hair
bristled
and
he
stopped
short
he
looked
at
the
steps
searching
for
the
fading
trail--and
he
stiffened
there
on
the
second
step
was
an
irregular
blotch
of
moisture
what
did
it
mean
had
vilma
crouched
there
had
she
ascended
those
steps
entered





with
drawn
face
he
began
to
skirt
the
base
of
the
black
building
searching
every
nook
and
cranny
scanning
the
bare
walls
his
heart
lay
like
ballast
in
his
breast
if--if
something
had
lured
vilma
into
that
demon-infested
vault

he
checked
the
thought
suddenly
he
cursed
mechanically
he
had
begun
to
measure
his
stride
in
time
with
the
doleful
dirge
from
the
castle
he
stalked
on
with
altered
pace
as
he
rounded
the
corner
at
the
rear
of
the
structure
he
saw
a
shadow
outlined
against
the
sky
crouching
on
a
ledge
below
one
of
the
little
windows
he
looked
again--cried
vilma
the
figure
above
him
stirred
looked
down
then
climbed
hastily
earthward
it
was
vilma

vilma
with
black
hair
hanging
stringily
about
her
head
face
pale
eyes
fixed
in
the
wideness
of
fear

vilma
with
her
wet
clothing
clinging
to
the
lovely
contours
of
her
symmetrical
body
oh
cliff
she
gasped
a
dry
sob
choking
her
thank
god--thank
god
she
clung
to
him
her
face
hidden
against
his
shoulder
quivering
uncontrollably
then
tears
came
saving
tears
relieving
her
pent-up
emotions
cliff
said
nothing
only
held
her
close
strongly
protective
and
gradually
he
felt
the
tempest
of
terror
subside
at
last
she
looked
up
some
of
the
dread
had
gone
from
her
face
and
she
tried
to
smile
i
guess--i
can't
take
it
she
said
cliff
shook
his
head
solemnly
you're
a
game
girl
vilma
you've
nerve
enough
for
two
men
if
you
can
tell
me
what
happened
or
if
you'd
rather
let
it
wait
just
say
so
i'll
feel
better
if
i
get
it
off
my
chest
she
said
you
probably
saw
those--things--carry
me
from
the
yacht
cliff
nodded
well
i
was
just
about
paralyzed
when
they
dropped
me
in
their
terrible
boat
i
remember
you
tried
to
arouse
me
then
that
horn
blew
and
i
just
seemed
to
float
away
in
an
ocean
of
sleep
after
that
i
can
remember
nothing
till
i
awoke
with
water
filling
my
eyes
and
nose
and
mouth
choking
me
someone's
arms
were
around
me--it
must
have
been
you
cliff--and
then
they
weren't
there
any
more
and
i
struggled
wildly
out
of
my
wits
i
don't
know
how
i
got
to
shore
but
i
did
and
i
lay
there
in
the
shadow
of
the
galley
choking
and
gagging
but
afraid
to
cough
it
wasn't
altogether
dark
and
i
could
see
those
dreadful
things
with
people
hanging
over
their
shoulders
carrying
them
along
a
narrow
ledge
close
to
the
water's
edge
heading
inland
i
thought
maybe
you
were
one
of
those
limp
bodies
and
i--i
almost
died
of
fright
after
a
while
the
last
one
had
gone
and
the
light
went
out
then
i
heard
another
pair
of
feet
moving
over
the
rocks
corio
i
suppose
the
sound
died--and
i
was
alone
that
place
was
awful
cliff
the
blackness
almost
drove
me
mad
i
wanted
to
scream
but
i
was
afraid
to
some
terrible
weight
seemed
to
be
crushing
my
lungs
if
i
followed
those
undead
things
they
might
capture
me
but
it
seemed
worse
to
stay
there
in
that
dreadful
dark
i
got
out
of
there
somehow
though
it
seemed
to
take
hours
then
i
didn't
know
what
to
do
i
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
dead
forest
trying
to
decide
trying
too
to
keep
myself
from
shrieking
and
running--anywhere
then
corio's
horn
blew
again--a
sound
cliff
worse
than
anything
i've
ever
heard
it--it
was
a
wicked
sound
promising
to
fulfill
every
foul
desire
that
ever
tainted
a
human
mind
it
repelled
yet
it
lured
irresistibly
and--i
answered
she
stopped
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
after
a
moment
she
went
on
the
sound
stopped
just
as
i
found
myself
crawling
on
hands
and
knees
up
the
stone
stairway
on
the
other
side
another
started--that
awful
groaning--music--but
it
didn't
draw
me
i
ran
down
the
steps
and
scurried
away
like
a
rabbit
trying
to
find
a
place
to
hide
after
a
while
i
came
back--i
thought
you
must
be
in
there--and
i
climbed
up
to
the
window
and--and--cliff
it's
hellish
her
eyes
boring
into
his
widened
in
the
same
rigid
terror
he
had
seen
in
them
when
he
joined
her
we
could
go
back
to
the
cove
and
get
away
on
the
ariel
vilma
cliff
said
stonily
and
if
you
think
we
should
we
will
but--i
brought
our
friends
here
and--well
i
want
to
get
them
out
if
i
can
with
an
effort
vilma
nodded
of
course
we
can't
do
anything
else
he
released
her
and
stepped
up
to
the
wall
i'm
going
to
see
what's
going
on
in
there
he
said
you
wait
here
till
i
come
down
in
sudden
dread
vilma
seized
his
arm
no
cliff
i
couldn't
stand
waiting
here
alone
i'll
go
with
you
he
nodded
understandingly
and
together
they
began
climbing
the
precipitous
wall
fitting
hands
and
feet
in
step-like
crevices
that
made
progress
fairly
rapid
soon
they
were
crouching
on
a
wide
stone
ledge
clinging
to
thin
rusted
bars
staring
into
the
black
castle
3
the
steps
of
torture
a
gigantic
hall
lay
before
them
a
single
chamber
whose
walls
were
the
walls
of
the
castle
whose
arched
ceiling
rose
far
above
them
directly
below
their
window
a
stone
platform
jutted
from
the
wall
spreading
entirely
across
the
chamber
a
stone
altar
squatted
in
the
center
of
the
platform
a
strangely
phosphorescent
fire
smoldering
on
its
top
and
from
the
altar
descended
a
wide
wide
stairway
ending
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
all
this
cliff
saw
in
a
single
sweeping
glance
afterward
he
had
eyes
for
nothing
save
the
lethal
horror
of
a
mad
mad
scene
revealed
by
the
dim
radiance
of
the
altar
fire
behind
the
altar
stood
five
huge
figures
clad
in
long
hooded
cloaks
of
scarlet
the
central
figure
had
arms
raised
wide
his
cloak
spread
like
the
wings
of
some
bloody
bird
of
prey
and
from
his
lips
came
a
guttural
incantation
a
blasphemous
chant
in
archaic
latin
in
time
with
the
wheeze
of
the
buried
organ
now
his
arms
dropped
and
he
was
silent
from
the
room
below
came
a
concerted
whine
of
ceremonial
devotion
a
hollow
hungry
wail
it
rose
from
the
bloodless
lips
of
strangely
assorted
human
figures
ranging
down
the
center
of
the
long
stairway
in
two
facing
columns
a
hundred
or
more
there
must
have
been
representing
half
as
many
periods
and
countries
according
to
their
strange
and
ancient
costumes
men
in
the
armor
of
medieval
persia--the
crew
of
the
black
galley
yellow-haired
vikings
hawk-faced
egyptians
with
leather-brown
skins
half-naked
islanders
red-sashed
pirates
from
the
spanish
main
men
of
today
and
about
all
like
the
dampness
that
clings
to
a
tombstone
hovered
a
cloud
of--death
the
undead
cliff's
gaze
roved
over
the
tensely
waiting
columns
then
leaped
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
there
cowering
dumbly
like
sheep
in
a
slaughter-pen
were
his
friends
from
the
ariel
all
clothing
had
been
stripped
from
them
and
they
stood
waiting
in
waxen
statuesque
stiffness
he
saw
then
that
three
others
lay
prone
before
the
stone
altar
naked
and
ominously
still
and
far
down
at
the
very
end
of
the
hall
stood
leon
corio
draped
in
a
hooded
cape
of
unbroken
black
a
glint
of
silver
in
his
hand--his
horn
of
drugging
sounds
now
as
though
at
a
silent
command
a
girl
left
the
group
and
began
to
mount
the
stairs
as
those
motionless
three
must
have
mounted
vivacious
ann--she
had
been
the
life
of
cliff's
yacht
party
but
now
she
was--changed
her
blanched
face
was
rigid
with
inexpressible
terror
despite
the
semi-stupor
which
numbed
her
senses
her
nude
body
glowed
like
marble
in
the
dim
light
horribly
her
feet
began
their
climb
with
a
little
catch
step
suggested
by
the
moaning
chant
of
that
cracked
organ
note
she
reached
the
first
of
the
undead
and
cliff
saw
light
glint
on
a
knife-blade
a
crimson
gash
appeared
in
the
flesh
of
her
thigh
and
dead
lips
touched
that
wound
drank
thirstily
the
girl
strode
on
blood
gleaming
darkly
on
the
white
skin
a
second
drank
of
the
crimson
flow--a
third--and
the
blood
ceased
gushing
forth
another
knife
flashed--and
lips
closed
again
and
again
on
a
redly
dripping
wound
and
the
girl
with
the
unchanging
pace
of
a
robot
climbed
the
stairway
to
its
very
top--climbed
while
fiendish
corpses
drank
her
life's
blood--climbed
to
sink
down
on
the
altar
one
of
the
red-clad
figures
stooped
over
her
lifted
her
buried
long
teeth
in
her
throat--and
cliff
saw
his
face
his
own
face
paled
and
talons
of
fear
raked
his
brain
those
others
on
the
stairs--they
were
abhorrent
zombies
freed
from
the
grave
but
this
monster
a
vampire
vested
with
the
lust
and
cruelty
and
power
of
hell
he
lowered
her
finally
and
she
sank
down
lay
still
beside
the
other
three
another
began
the
hellish
climb
a
giant
of
a
man
with
a
thickly
muscled
torso
cliff
knew
him
instantly
and
his
heart
seemed
to
stop
leslie
starke
they'd
played
football
together
a
brave
man--a
fighter
he
mounted
the
stairway
with
the
same
little
catch
step
the
same
plodding
stiffness
no
resistance
no
struggle--only
a
hell
of
fear
on
his
face
the
marrow
melted
from
cliff
darrell's
bones
what--what
could
he
do
against
a
power
that
did
that
to
les
starke
he
tried
to
swallow
but
the
saliva
had
dried
on
his
tongue
he
wanted
to
turn
to
vilma
but
he
could
not
wrench
his
eyes
from
the
frightful
spectacle
up
the
stone
steps
starke
strode
and
no
blade
leaped
toward
him
no
thirsty
lips
closed
on
his
flesh
in
an
unwavering
line
he
mounted
toward
the
cowled
monster
in
the
center
of
the
dais
like
a
puppet
on
the
end
of
a
string
mounted
to
pause
before
the
stone
altar
to
lie
on
it
head
bent
back
throat
bared
mercifully
cliff
regained
enough
control
to
close
his
eyes
he
opened
them
at
a
gasp
from
vilma
saw
the
vampire
raise
the
flaccid
body
of
les
starke
and
hurl
it
far
from
him
to
crash
to
the
stone
steps
to
roll
and
thud
and
tumble
down
and
down
sickeningly
to
lie
awkwardly
twisted
on
the
floor
before
his
companions
and
another
began
to
climb
the
long
stone
steps
all
through
the
interminable
night
cliff
and
vilma
crouched
on
the
ledge
staring
through
the
barred
window
a
hundred
times
they
would
have
fled
to
escape
the
maddening
scene
but
they
could
not
move
senses
reeled
before
the
awful
monotony
of
the
ceaseless
climbing
their
eyes
smarted
with
fixed
staring
their
tongues
and
throats
were
parched
to
desert
dryness
yet
only
after
hours
of
endless
watching
only
after
the
last
victim
had
climbed
the
steps
did
the
edge
of
terror
dull
and
a
modicum
of
control
return
to
their
bodies
stiffly
cliff
looked
over
his
shoulder
a
faint
tinge
of
gray
rimmed
the
sea
on
the
eastern
horizon
almost
daylight
he
whispered
hoarsely
vilma
nodded
her
gaze
still
held
by
that
chamber
of
horror
cliff
followed
the
direction
of
her
eyes
and
saw
corio
standing
like
a
great
bat
in
his
hooded
cape
close
to
the
far
wall
he
raised
his
four-piped
horn
to
his
lips
and
the
instrument's
fourth
note
crept
through
the
room





it
was
a
doleful
sound
a
cry
like
the
cry
death
itself
might
possess
yet
oddly--and
horribly--it
was
soothing
promising
the
peace
of
endless
sleep
and
touched
by
its
power
the
columns
of
undead
stiffened
thinned
to
wraiths
flowed
as
water
flows
down
the
stone
steps
vanished
the
dead-alive--those
five
vampires
in
crimson
cowls--looked
upward
uneasily
the
shadows
under
the
roof
were
graying
with
the
light
of
dawn
cliff
could
sense
their
thought
before
sunrise
they
must
be
in
their
tombs
under
the
castle
to
sleep
until
another
night
with
one
accord
they
strode
down
the
stairs
past
corio
who
had
prostrated
himself
and
entered
a
black
opening
in
the
wall
with
their
departure
the
altar
fire
dimmed
to
a
sullen
ember
corio
arose
he
was
alone
in
the
chamber
save
for
that
dead
broken
body
lying
in
a
twisted
heap
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
those
other
half-alive
wretches
stretched
out
before
the
altar
now
cliff
told
himself
was
the
time
for
him
to
get
in
there
at
corio
now
was
the
time
to
rescue
his
friends--but
he
continued
to
crouch
unmoving
again
corio
blew
on
his
silver
horn
and
a
faint
cry
leaped
from
vilma's
tensed
lips
the
luring
note
that
had
drawn
her
cliff
thought
hazily
then
he
thought
of
nothing
save
the
sound
the
sound
that
promised
him
all
he
could
desire
earth
and
its
dominion
his
for
the
taking--if
he
answered
that
call
then
even
the
sound
eluded
his
senses
and
he
heard
only
the
promise
he
must
answer
must
claim
what
was
rightfully
his
but
those
half-dead
creatures--sight
of
their
stirring
steadied
his
staggering
sanity
here
and
there
heads
lifted
and
bloodless
husks
of
bodies
tried
to
rise
in
the
pallid
light
they
seemed
like
corpses
freed
from
newly
opened
graves
some
could
only
reach
their
knees
others
rose
to
uncertain
limbs
and
all
moved
down
the
stairway
toward
corio
answering
his
summons
followed
as
he
made
his
slow
way
toward
the
opening
in
the
wall
still
blowing
the
single
note--the
note
that
promised
earth
and
all
it
held
cliff
glanced
toward
vilma--and
she
was
not
there
he
looked
down
saw
her
far
below
dropping
from
crack
to
crevice
with
amazing
speed
and
daring
hastening
toward--corio
the
thought
jarred
any
lingering
taint
of
allurement
from
cliff's
mind
he
must
stop
her
he
swung
around
ignoring
the
cramped
stiffness
of
his
legs
and
started
down
the
steep
wall
down
down
recklessly
with
corio's
horn-note
only
a
faintly
heard
sound
fading
behind
him
now
he
saw
vilma
reach
the
rocks
below
and
dash
around
the
corner
of
the
castle
and
he
cursed
redoubling
his
speed
down--down--and
suddenly
the
ancient
rock
crumbled
underfoot
for
an
instant
he
hung
from
straining
fingertips--then
dropped
a
smashing
impact--a
stone
that
slid
beneath
him--and
his
head
crashed
against
the
castle
wall
through
a
fiery
mist
of
pain
he
pictured
vilma
in
the
grasp
of
corio
the
mist
thickened--grew
black--engulfed
him
4
in
corio's
hands
cliff
awoke
with
the
sun
glaring
down
on
his
face
he
opened
his
eyes
and
stabbing
lances
of
light
pierced
his
eyeballs
momentarily
blinded
he
pressed
his
hands
across
his
face
and
struggled
erect
there
was
a
sick
feeling
in
his
stomach
and
the
back
of
his
head
throbbed
incessantly
he
touched
the
aching
area
and
winced
a
lump
like
an
egg
thrust
out
his
scalp
it
was
sticky
with
blood
he
stood
there
weaving
from
side
to
side
trying
to
recall
something
as
memory
came
he
groaned
vilma
he
had
last
seen
her
racing
madly
toward
corio
lured
by
his
damned
horn
it
was
daylight
now
the
sun
had
risen
at
least
an
hour
ago
an
hour--with
vilma
gone
shaking
his
head
to
clear
it
and
gritting
his
teeth
at
the
pain
he
stalked
along
the
wall
turning
the
corner
he
strode
on
toward
the
crooked
steps
the
lifeless
terrain
reeled
dizzily
but
he
went
on
resolutely
the
pain
in
his
head
was
fading
to
a
dull
ache
and
as
he
mounted
the
steps
strength
seemed
to
flow
back
into
his
legs
with
every
sense
taut
he
passed
into
the
gloom
of
the
castle
a
quick
glance
he
cast
about--saw
the
body
of
starke
lying
where
it
had
fallen
no
use
to
examine
it
there
was
no
life
there
his
gaze
swept
up
the
slope
of
the
stairway
to
the
altar
at
its
head
lingered
on
the
phosphorescent
eye
of
light
still
glowing
there
then
he
shrugged
grimly
and
moved
on
to
the
doorway
in
the
wall
warily
he
peered
in
as
his
eyes
adjusted
themselves
to
the
greater
darkness
he
saw
a
narrow
stairway
leading
downward
into
a
shadowy
corridor
somewhere
in
the
tunnel's
depths
a
faint
light
shone
he
could
see
nothing
more
he
moved
stealthily
down
the
damp
dank
stairs
at
the
bottom
he
paused
listening
he
could
hear
nothing
a
hundred
feet
ahead
the
corridor
divided
in
two
a
burning
torch
was
thrust
in
the
wall
at
the
junction
cliff
nodded
with
satisfaction
corio
must
be
somewhere
near
by
for
only
a
human
needed
light
silently
cliff
strode
along
the
corridor
at
the
fork
he
hesitated
then
chose
the
right
branch
for
light
glowed
faintly
along
that
passageway
the
other
led
downward
black
as
the
pits
of
hell
a
doorway
appeared
in
the
wall
ahead
and
he
moved
warily
with
fists
clenched
flickering
torchlight
filtered
into
the
corridor
there
was
no
audible
sound
now
cliff
peered
into
a
small
chamber
and
gasped
in
sudden
horror
his
eyes
staring
unwinkingly
at
a
spectacle
incredibly
pitiful
here
were
the
passengers
of
the
ariel
whitely
naked
and
lying
in
little
groups
on
the
cold
stone
floor
huddled
together
for
warmth
their
faces
turned
toward
darrell
as
he
stood
in
the
doorway
but
there
was
no
recognition
in
the
vacuous
eyes
no
thought
no
intelligence
and
little
life
in
the
wide-mouthed
stares
it
seemed
as
though
their
souls
had
been
drained
from
their
bodies
with
their
blood
sickened
cliff
turned
away
cursing
his
own
helplessness
to
aid
them
cursing
leon
corio
who
was
responsible
for
their
plight
black
wrath
gripped
him
as
he
moved
on
again
the
corridor
branched
and
again
he
kept
to
the
right
suddenly
he
halted
ears
straining
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
voice--the
hollow
voice
of
corio
it
came
faintly
but
clearly
from
a
room
at
the
end
of
the
passageway
cliff
went
forward
slowly
and
so
my
dear
corio
was
saying
we
entered
into
a
pact
with
the--master
a
pact
sealed
with
blood
in
exchange
for
our
lives
we
three
were
to
bring
other
humans
to
this
island
for
the
feasting
of
the
dead-alive
every
third
month
each
of
us
must
return
with
our
cargo
when
the
moon
is
full
and
since
we
come
back
on
alternating
months
they
have
a
constant
supply
of
fresh
blood
usually
some
of
our
captives
live
from
full
moon
to
full
moon
before
they
become
like
those
of
the
galley--the
undead
some
of
these
we
waken
when
it
suits
our
fancy
they
are
not
like
the
masters
they
awaken
only
when
we
call
them--we
three
or
the
masters
more
than
life
they
give
us
for
what
we
do
centuries
ago
pirates
used
this
island
for
refuge
they--died--and
they
left
their
treasure
in
this
castle
it
lies
in
the
room
where
the
masters
lie
and
we
three
receive
payment
in
gold
and
gems
tonight
i
receive
my
pay
and
tomorrow
i
leave
on
the
ariel--and
you
go
with
me
cliff
heard
vilma
answer
and
even
while
his
heart
leaped
with
relief
he
marveled
at
the
cool
scorn
in
her
voice
so
i
go
with
you
do
i
i'd
rather
climb
the
stairs
with
the
rest
of
your
victims
than
have
anything
to
do
with
you--you
monster
when
cliff
darrell
finds
you----
darrell
corio's
voice
was
a
frozen
sneer
he'll
do
nothing
i'll
find
him--and
he'll
wish
he
could
climb
the
stairs
of
blood
as
for
you
you'll
go
with
me
and
like
it
a
drop
of
my
blood
in
your
veins
and
you
will
belong
to
the
master
as
i
do
we
shall
attend
to
that
but
first
there
is
something
else--more
pleasant
his
words
fell
to
an
indistinguishable
purr
still
moving
stealthily
cliff
hastened
forward
suddenly
vilma
screamed
and
he
launched
himself
madly
across
the
remaining
distance
stood
crouching
at
the
threshold
vilma
lay
on
an
ancient
bed
her
wrists
and
ankles
bound
with
leather
thongs
drawn
about
the
four
tall
bed-posts
only
the
torn
remnants
of
her
under-garments
covered
the
rounded
contours
of
her
body
and
corio
crouched
over
her
caressing
the
pink
flesh
vilma
writhed
beneath
his
touch





cliff
growled
deep
in
his
throat
as
he
sprang
corio
spun
around
and
leaped
aside
but
he
was
too
slow
to
escape
cliff's
powerful
lunge
one
hand
closed
on
his
thin
neck
and
the
other
a
rock-like
fist
made
a
bloody
ruin
of
his
mouth
howling
with
pain
corio
tried
to
sink
his
teeth
in
cliff's
arm
cliff
flung
him
aside
following
with
the
easy
glide
of
a
boxer
corio
crawled
to
his
feet
cringing
dodging
before
the
nemesis
that
stalked
him
again
cliff
leaped
and
corio
yellow
with
fear
darted
around
the
bed
and
ran
wildly
into
the
hallway
at
the
door
cliff
checked
himself
reason
holding
him
corio
could
elude
him
with
ease
in
this
labyrinth
of
passages
and
his
first
concern
was
vilma's
safety
he
returned
to
the
bed
vilma
looked
up
at
him
with
such
relief
and
thankfulness
on
her
face
that
cliff
with
a
little
choked
cry
flung
himself
to
his
knees
beside
the
bed
and
kissed
her
hungrily
for
moments
their
lips
clung
then
cliff
straightened
shakily
trying
to
laugh
we've
got
to
get
out
of
here
sweetheart
he
said
i'm
not
afraid
of
corio
but
he
knows
things
about
this
place
that
we
don't
know
after
you're
safe
on
the
yacht
i'll
come
back
and
get
him
he
looked
around
for
something
with
which
to
cut
her
bonds
on
the
wall
above
the
bed
were
crossed
a
pair
of
murderous-looking
cutlasses
seizing
one
of
these
cliff
wrenched
it
from
its
fastenings
and
drew
it
through
the
cords
she
stood
beside
him
free
your
clothing----
cliff
began
his
eyes
on
her
almost-nude
body
she
blushed
and
pointed
mutely
to
a
heap
of
rags
on
the
floor
her
eyes
flamed
wrathfully
he--he
ripped
them
from
me
the
muscles
of
cliff's
jaws
knotted
and
he
scowled
as
he
surveyed
the
room
for
a
drape
or
hanging
to
cover
her
for
the
first
time
he
really
saw
the
place
all
the
lavish
splendor
of
royalty
had
been
expended
on
this
chamber
it
might
have
been
the
bedroom
of
a
king
except
that
the
ancient
furnishings
belonged
to
no
particular
period
were
in
fact
the
loot
of
raids
extended
over
centuries
yet
despite
its
splendor
everything
was
repulsive
cloaked
with
the
same
air
of
unearthly
gloom
that
hovered
about
the
galley
he
moved
toward
an
intricately
woven
tapestry
but
vilma
checked
him
shuddering
with
revulsion
no
cliff--it's
too
much
like
grave
clothes
everything
about
this
place
makes
my
flesh
crawl
i'd
rather
stay
as
i
am
than
touch
any
of
it
cliff
nodded
slowly
let's
go
then
they
hurried
through
the
corridors
toward
the
stairway
with
cliff
holding
the
cutlas
in
readiness
as
they
passed
the
room
in
which
lay
the
ariel's
passengers
he
tried
to
divert
vilma's
attention
but
she
looked
in
as
though
hypnotized
i
saw
them
before
she
whispered
it's
awful
as
they
started
up
the
stairway
to
the
great
hall
cliff
took
the
lead
he
moved
with
utmost
caution
it
doesn't
seem
right
he
said
uneasily
we
should
hear
from
corio
at
that
moment
they
did
hear
from
him--literally
from
somewhere
in
the
maze
of
tunnels
came
the
sound
of
his
accursed
horn--the
note
of
sleep
it
swirled
insidiously
about
their
heads
numbing
their
senses
cliff
felt
his
stride
falter
saw
vilma
stumble
and
he
hurled
himself
forward
furiously
gripping
her
arm
hurry
he
shouted
striving
to
pierce
the
fog
of
sleep
we've
got
to
get
out
damn
him
vilma
rallied
for
an
instant
and
they
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
on--across
that
wide
wide
room
each
step
a
struggle
on
while
the
droning
sound
floated
languidly
through
every
nerve
cell
on--till
their
muscles
could
no
longer
move
and
they
sagged
to
the
hard
stone
asleep





moments
later
cliff
opened
his
eyes
to
meet
the
hellish
glare
of
leon
corio
corio
smiled
thinly
so--you
awaken
good
i
would
have
you
know
the
fate
i
have
planned
for
you
you
see
this
he
held
the
cutlas
high
above
darrell's
throat
like
the
blade
of
a
guillotine
with
this
i
could
end
your
life
quite
painlessly
and
quickly
it
really
would
prove
entertaining
for
miss
bradley
i'm
sure
he
chuckled
faintly
behind
bruised
and
swollen
lips
cliff
squirmed
striving
to
rise
then
subsided
instantly
he
was
bound
hand
and
foot
i
could
kill
you
corio
repeated
musingly
but
that
would
lack
finesse
his
teeth
bared
in
a
feline
smile
and
it
would
be
such
a
waste--of
blood
instead
i'll
take
you
out
to
the
galley
and
let
you
lie
there
till
her
crew
awakens
tonight
they
have
tasted
blood
and
after
tonight
will
taste
none
again
for
another
month
i
imagine
they'll--drain
you
dry
the
last
phrase
was
a
vicious
snarl
cliff
heard
vilma
utter
a
suppressed
sob
and
he
turned
his
head
she
lay
close
by
bound
like
him
with
strips
of
leather
furiously
cliff
strained
at
his
fetters
but
they
held
and
while
you
wait
for
those
gentle
persians
to
awaken
corio
continued
in
tones
caressingly
soft
you
can
think
of
your
sweetheart
in
my
arms
it
may
teach
you
not
to
strike
your
betters--though
you
can
never
profit
by
your
lesson
stooping
he
raised
cliff's
powerful
form
and
managed
to
fling
him
over
one
shoulder
then
he
moved
from
the
great
hall
down
the
stone
steps
and
across
the
dead
plain
with
its
sighing
skeleton
trees
he
was
panting
jerkily
by
the
time
he
came
to
the
fissure
leading
to
the
cove
but
he
reached
it
despite
cliff's
two
hundred
pounds
without
pausing
he
went
on
into
the
cavern
along
the
rock
ledge
to
step
at
last
upon
the
deck
of
the
black
galley
pleasant
thoughts
he
said
gently
as
he
dropped
cliff
to
the
spongy
boards
you
have
only
to
wait
till
dark
cliff
listened
to
his
rapid
footfalls
till
they
died
in
distance
then
there
was
no
sound
save
his
own
breathing
gradually
his
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
heavy
gloom
and
he
saw
that
corio
had
dropped
him
just
at
the
edge
of
the
rowers'
pit
there
were
white
things
down
there--bones
pale
as
marble
scattered
about
aimlessly
could--could
those
bones
join
to
make
the
rowers
who
would
arise
with
the
night
it
seemed
absurd--was
absurd--yet
he
knew
it
was
so
he
had
seen
too
much
to
doubt
it
he
rolled
over
on
his
back
and
stared
upward
into
the
shadows
he
must
lie
here
helpless
while
corio
returned
to
vilma--did
with
her
as
he
pleased
perhaps
he
might
even
transform
her
into
a
blood-tainted
monster
like
himself
he
saw
her
again
in
that
room
of
ancient
splendor
spread-eagled
to
the
bed
and
the
muscles
corded
in
his
arms
and
his
lips
strained
white
in
a
futile
effort
to
break
free
interminably
he
lay
there
waiting
the
galley
was
damp
with
the
chilling
dampness
of
a
sepulcher
and
the
dampness
penetrated
deeper
and
deeper
clamping
his
jaws
together
to
prevent
their
quivering
he
struggled
against
a
rising
tide
of
madness
which
gnawed
at
his
reason
his
mind
began
to
crunch
and
jangle
like
a
machine
out
of
gear
threatening
to
destroy
itself
on
and
on
in
plodding
indifference
the
stolid
moments
passed
till
at
last
cliff
realized
that
it
was
growing
darker
he
rolled
over
on
his
side
and
stared
into
the
galley
pit
eyes
fixed
on
the
inert
masses
of
white
soon
they
would
move
soon
the
undead
would
rise
his
thoughts
touched
by
the
whips
of
dread
sped
about
like
slaves
seeking
escape
from
a
torture
pit
and
abruptly
out
of
the
welter
of
chaotic
ideas
came
one
straw
of
sanity
he
seized
it
his
heart
hammering
with
hope
those
persian
sailors
were
armed
their
swords
and
knives
were
real
for
they
cut
flesh
somewhere
among
their
bones
must
lie
sharp-edged
blades
he
struggled
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
let
his
feet
drop
over
as
they
touched
he
balanced
precariously
for
an
instant
then
fell
to
his
knees
he
peered
feverishly
about
among
white
bones
moldering
garments
and
rusted
armor--and
saw
a
faint
glimmer
of
light
on
pointed
steel
he
sank
forward
on
his
face
in
the
direction
of
the
gleam
turned
over
squirmed
and
writhed
till
he
felt
the
cold
blade
against
his
hands
he
caught
it
between
his
fingers
and
began
sawing
back
and
forth
it
was
heart-breaking
work
age
had
dulled
the
weapon
and
long
slivers
of
rust
flaked
off
but
the
leather
which
bound
him
was
also
ancient
though
progress
was
slow
and
the
effort
laborious
cliff
knew
his
bonds
were
weakening
but
it
was
growing
darker
even
now
he
could
see
only
a
suggestion
of
gray
among
the
shadows
if
those
undead
things
materialized
while
he
lay
among
them
sweat
stood
out
on
his
forehead
and
he
redoubled
his
efforts
straining
at
the
leather
as
he
sawed
with
a
snap
the
cords
parted
and
his
hands
were
free
a
single
slash
severed
the
thongs
about
his
ankles
and
he
stood
up
leaped
to
the
deck
not
an
instant
too
soon
there
was
movement
in
the
pit--a
hideous
crawling
of
bones
assembling
themselves
into
skeletal
form
cliff
waited
to
see
no
more
there
were
limits
to
what
one
could
see
and
remain
sane
with
a
bound
he
crossed
the
rotting
deck
and
sprang
ashore
despite
the
dark
he
almost
ran
from
the
madness
of
that
cave
ran
till
he
passed
through
the
wall
of
rock
till
he
saw
the
rim
of
the
moon
gleaming
behind
the
castle
5
the
end
of
the
island
out
on
the
plain
he
sprinted
through
the
ghostly
forest
he
knew
he
had
no
time
to
spare--knew
that
soon
the
march
of
torture
would
begin--knew
that
if
vilma
were
within
the
castle
she
must
answer
the
summons
of
corio's
horn
even
now
light
glowed
faintly
in
the
high
square
windows
that
horn
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
he
stopped
short
if
he
heard
the
horn
he
too
must
answer
he
dared
not
risk
it
with
impatient
fingers
he
tore
a
strip
of
cloth
from
his
shirt
rolled
it
into
a
cylinder
and
thrust
it
into
his
ear
another
for
the
other
ear--and
he
darted
up
into
the
castle
a
sweeping
glance
revealed
no
one
only
the
murky
glow
of
the
altar
fire
and
the
wraiths
of
smoke
pluming
upward
toward
the
shadowed
roof
wishing
now
that
he
had
brought
a
weapon
from
the
galley
cliff
crossed
to
the
opening
in
the
wall
he
stood
at
the
top
of
the
steps
listening
then
cursed
silently
as
he
remembered
that
he
could
hear
none
but
very
loud
sounds
he
saw
nothing
so
he
hastened
down
into
the
corridor
his
steps
were
swiftly
stealthy
as
he
moved
toward
corio's
room
he
was
past
the
first
branching
passage
when
a
sixth
sense
warned
him
of
someone's
approach
he
ran
swiftly
to
the
next
fork
then
paused
within
its
shelter
and
glanced
back
saw
five
red-cowled
figures
glide
along
the
tunnel
and
vanish
up
the
stairway
cliff
frowned
with
the
vampires
in
the
great
hall
corio
must
soon
follow
leading
his
victims
to
the
blood-feast
he
drew
back
deeper
into
the
shadows
his
groping
hands
touched
something
in
the
dark--round
and
hard--like
a
keg
curiously
he
investigated
it
was
a
keg
and
there
were
others
a
sandy
powder
trailed
to
the
floor
from
a
crack
in
one
of
them
thoughtfully
cliff
let
it
run
through
his
fingers
gunpowder
of
course--he
had
heard
corio
mention
pirates
and
their
treasure
and
this
had
been
their
cache
of
explosive
an
idea
was
forming
he
looked
up
to
see
a
shadow
pass
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
he
crept
forward
and
peered
out
he
saw
the
black-hooded
figure
of
leon
corio
striding
along
saw
him
enter
the
room
where
the
passengers
of
the
ariel
lay
in
a
breath
cliff
was
down
the
corridor
to
corio's
room
a
tarnished
silver
candelabrum
shed
faint
light
through
the
chamber
and
by
its
flickering
glow
he
searched
for
vilma
thoroughly
painstakingly--futilely
he
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
in
indecision
his
forehead
creased
with
anxiety
if
only
he
could
find
her
he'd
know
how
to
plan
he
ran
his
hand
through
his
hair
helplessly
then
heard
very
faintly
the
luring
note
of
corio's
horn
she
must
answer
that
summons
unless
corio
had
her
tied
somewhere
his
best
chance
of
finding
her
lay
in
the
hall
above
on
the
wall
still
hung
the
mate
of
the
cutlas
he
had
used
to
free
vilma
he
wrenched
it
down
and
ran
out
into
the
corridor
the
last
of
the
naked
marchers
was
disappearing
up
the
stairway
now
the
horn-note
died
and
he
could
feel
more
than
hear
the
rumbling
bass
of
the
dirge
from
the
depths
below
him
he
ran
the
rest
of
the
distance
along
the
passageway
and
mounted
the
steps
two
at
a
stride
he
looked
into
the
torture
hall
as
on
the
previous
night
corio
stood
far
back
close
to
the
wall
in
which
cliff
crouched
the
arms
of
the
master
were
raised
high
raised
cliff
knew
though
he
could
not
hear
it
in
a
blasphemous
incantation
and
then
he
saw
something
that
sent
a
crimson
lance
of
fury
crashing
through
his
brain
vilma
stripped
like
the
rest
stood
with
the
other
victims
at
the
foot
of
the
long
steps
her
body
gleamed
pinkly
in
contrast
to
the
pallid
drabness
of
the
half-dead
automatons
and
she
held
her
head
proudly
erect
but
from
where
he
stood
cliff
could
see
the
side
of
her
face
and
it
bore
a
look
of
terror
he
could
see
corio's
face
too
and
he
was
looking
at
the
girl
baffled
fury
glaring
from
his
eyes--as
though
she
were
there
against
his
will
cliff's
first
impulse
was
to
fling
himself
out
there
with
his
cutlas
and
hack
a
way
to
freedom
for
vilma
and
himself
but
cold
reason
checked
this
folly
such
a
course
could
end
only
in
death
motionless
he
watched
the
scene
before
him
his
brain
frantically
seeking
a
plan
with
even
a
ghost
of
a
chance
of
succeeding
the
gunpowder
there
was
enough
of
the
stuff
below
to
blast
this
entire
castle
into
the
hell
where
it
belonged
hastily
he
retraced
his
steps
to
the
tunnel
in
which
he
had
found
the
kegs
plucking
the
torch
from
its
niche
in
the
wall
as
he
passed
it
he
held
it
high
above
his
head
as
he
examined
the
contents
of
the
broken
keg
unmistakably
gunpowder
thrusting
the
cutlas
beneath
his
belt
he
clutched
a
handful
of
the
black
dust
then
crouching
close
to
the
floor
he
drew
an
irregular
thread
through
the
passageway
toward
the
stairs
once
he
returned
for
more
powder
but
in
a
few
minutes
the
job
was
done
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
where
the
trail
ended
he
touched
his
torch
to
the
black
line
and
watched
a
hissing
spark
snake
its
white-smoked
way
back
toward
the
powder
kegs
an
instant
he
watched
it
then
sprang
up
the
stairs
he'd
have
to
move
fast
with
a
hideous
howl
he
darted
into
the
hall
his
cutlas
above
his
head
corio
spun
about--and
it
was
his
last
living
act
a
single
sweep
of
the
great
blade
sheared
his
head
from
his
neck
sent
it
rolling
grotesquely
along
the
floor
for
three
heart-beats
the
body
stood
with
a
fountain
of
blood
spurting
from
severed
arteries
then
it
crashed
coolly
cliff
leaned
over
the
twitching
cadaver
ignoring
the
bedlam
on
the
stairs
the
horde
sweeping
down
toward
him
hurling
aside
the
waiting
humans
he
pried
open
clutching
fingers
seized
a
twisted
silver
instrument
and
raised
it
to
his
lips





the
mass
of
undead
were
almost
upon
him
the
murky
light
glinting
on
menacing
blades
when
cliff
blew
the
first
note
the
note
of
sleep
he
tried
again
hastily
and
it
was
the
right
one
at
the
doleful
soothing
sound
the
undead
halted
in
their
tracks
halted--and
melted
into
nothingness
before
his
eyes
but
now
those
other
five
in
their
robes
of
bloody
red--they
were
charging
and
even
though
they
were
unarmed
cliff
felt
a
stab
of
fear
they
possessed
powers
beyond
the
human
powers
a
mortal
could
not
combat
he
braced
himself
and
waited
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
they
stopped
ranging
in
a
wide
half-circle
the
central
monster--the
master--flung
up
his
arms
in
a
strangely
terrifying
gesture
and
cliff
saw
his
carmine
lips
move
in
a
chant
which
he
could
not
hear
something
a
chilling
presence
hovered
about
him
seemed
to
settle
upon
him
cloaking
him
with
the
might
of
the
devil
himself
that
unheard
incantation
continued
and
cliff
felt
a
cold
rigidity
creeping
through
every
fiber
slowly
freezing
his
limbs
into
columns
of
ice
with
a
mighty
effort
of
will
he
flung
himself
toward
that
accursed
drinker
of
blood--and
at
that
instant
a
terrific
detonation
rocked
the
ancient
building
and
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
flame
burst
from
the
opening
in
the
wall
cliff
was
hurled
from
his
feet
rolled
over
and
over
and
crashed
against
the
wall
by
the
awful
concussion
the
cutlas
and
silver
horn
sent
whirling
through
the
air
dizzily
he
staggered
to
his
feet
crouching
defensively
sounds
came
to
him
clearly
now
the
explosion
must
have
jarred
the
plugs
from
his
ears
he
scanned
the
room
saw
the
unclad
humans
scattered
everywhere
most
of
them
lying
still
and
unconscious
he
saw
vilma
rising
slowly
then
he
looked
for
the
monsters
in
red
startled
he
saw
them
rushing
toward
the
opening
in
the
wall
to
vanish
in
its
smoke-filled
interior
why
did
they----
then
he
knew
down
there
somewhere
were
their
graves--graves
rent
and
broken
by
the
explosion--graves
threatened
by
the
flames--and
panic
had
seized
the
vampires
fear
of
the
death
which
would
result
with
exile
from
their
tombs
unsteadily
cliff
crossed
to
vilma
she
saw
him
coming
and
flung
herself
sobbing
into
his
arms
he
crushed
her
lithe
form
close--and
another
explosion
more
violent
than
the
first
sent
a
section
of
the
stone
floor
leaping
upward
as
though
with
life
of
its
own
clinging
to
vilma
cliff
managed
to
maintain
his
footing
though
the
floor
bucked
and
heaved
a
snapping
booming
roar--and
a
great
chasm
opened
in
the
floor
a
breathless
instant--and
a
segment
of
the
stone
stairs
rumbling
thunderously
dropped
out
of
sight
into
a
newly
formed
pit
with
it
went
the
blasphemous
altar
and
its
phosphorescent
fire
deafened
stunned
momentarily
powerless
to
move
cliff's
mind
groped
for
an
explanation
it
seemed
incredible
that
gunpowder
could
cause
such
havoc
and
the
swaying
of
the
floor
continued
the
thick
stone
walls
shook
alarmingly
suddenly
he
understood
an
earthquake
the
explosions
had
jarred
the
none-too-stable
understrata
of
rock
into
spasmodic
motion
that
must
grind
everything
to
bits
the
island
was
doomed
and
earth
would
be
better
without
it
if
only
they
could
reach
the
ariel
first
new
strength
flowed
through
him
and
hugging
vilma
close
he
staggered
toward
the
spot
where
he
knew
the
door
must
be
somehow
he
reached
it
and
reeled
down
the
broken
stone
steps
the
plain
of
dead
trees
swayed
like
the
deck
of
a
ship
in
a
storm
as
cliff
started
across
it
a
gale
had
arisen
and
swept
in
from
the
sea
ripping
dry
branches
from
the
skeleton
growths
and
whirling
them
about
like
straws
yet
somehow
cliff
reached
the
crevice
in
the
rock
wall
with
his
burden
reached
the
deck
of
the
galley
crossed
it
and
won
to
the
safety
of
the
ariel
minutes
later
with
diesel
engines
purring
they
crept
out
through
the
narrow
channel
into
the
open
sea





ten
minutes
later
the
isle
of
the
undead
lay
safely
behind
them
vilma
had
dressed
and
now
they
sat
together
in
the
pilot
house
cliff
had
one
arm
about
her
and
one
hand
on
the
wheel
and
so
the
girl
was
saying
while
corio
carried
you
to
that
terrible
old
boat
i
got
loose
he
hadn't
tied
me
very
tightly
and
i
slipped
my
hands
free
i
had
to
hide
and
i
could
think
of
only
one
place
that
might
be
safe
where
he
wouldn't
think
to
look
for
me
i
ran
down
to
the
room
where
those--those
others
lay
i
undressed
and
buried
myself
among
them
it
was
horrible--the
way
they
sucked
each
other's
wounds
cliff
pressed
a
hand
across
her
lips
forget
that
he
said
almost
fiercely
forget
all
of
it--d'you
hear
she
looked
up
at
him
and
said
simply
i'll
try
they
glanced
back
toward
the
black
blotch
on
the
horizon
the
seismic
disturbances
continued
unabated
at
that
moment
they
saw
the
barrier
of
rock
like
a
skull
split
and
sink
into
the
sea
beyond
cleansing
tongues
of
flame
licked
the
sky
they
saw
a
single
jagged
wall
of
the
castle
still
standing
one
window
glowing
in
its
black
expanse
like
a
square
bloody
moon
against
a
bloody
sky
it
crumbled
they
turned
away
and
cliff's
arm
circled
the
girl
he
loved
their
lips
met
and
clung
and
the
ariel
plowed
on
through
the
frothing
brine
bearing
them
toward
safety
and
forgetfulness
together
