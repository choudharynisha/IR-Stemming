when
a
traveler
in
north
central
massachusetts
takes
the
wrong
fork
at
the
junction
of
the
aylesbury
pike
just
beyond
dean's
corners
he
comes
upon
a
lonely
and
curious
country
the
ground
gets
higher
and
the
brier-bordered
stone
walls
press
closer
and
closer
against
the
ruts
of
the
dusty
curving
road
the
trees
of
the
frequent
forest
belts
seem
too
large
and
the
wild
weeds
brambles
and
grasses
attain
a
luxuriance
not
often
found
in
settled
regions
at
the
same
time
the
planted
fields
appear
singularly
few
and
barren
while
the
sparsely
scattered
houses
wear
a
surprizing
uniform
aspect
of
age
squalor
and
dilapidation
without
knowing
why
one
hesitates
to
ask
directions
from
the
gnarled
solitary
figures
spied
now
and
then
on
crumbling
doorsteps
or
in
the
sloping
rock-strewn
meadows
those
figures
are
so
silent
and
furtive
that
one
feels
somehow
confronted
by
forbidden
things
with
which
it
would
be
better
to
have
nothing
to
do
when
a
rise
in
the
road
brings
the
mountains
in
view
above
the
deep
woods
the
feeling
of
strange
uneasiness
is
increased
the
summits
are
too
rounded
and
symmetrical
to
give
a
sense
of
comfort
and
naturalness
and
sometimes
the
sky
silhouettes
with
especial
clearness
the
queer
circles
of
tall
stone
pillars
with
which
most
of
them
are
crowned
gorges
and
ravines
of
problematical
depth
intersect
the
way
and
the
crude
wooden
bridges
always
seem
of
dubious
safety
when
the
road
dips
again
there
are
stretches
of
marshland
that
one
instinctively
dislikes
and
indeed
almost
fears
at
evening
when
unseen
whippoorwills
chatter
and
the
fireflies
come
out
in
abnormal
profusion
to
dance
to
the
raucous
creepily
insistent
rhythms
of
stridently
piping
bullfrogs
the
thin
shining
line
of
the
miskatonic's
upper
reaches
has
an
oddly
serpentlike
suggestion
as
it
winds
close
to
the
feet
of
the
domed
hills
among
which
it
rises
as
the
hills
draw
nearer
one
heeds
their
wooded
sides
more
than
their
stone-crowned
tops
those
sides
loom
up
so
darkly
and
precipitously
that
one
wishes
they
would
keep
their
distance
but
there
is
no
road
by
which
to
escape
them
across
a
covered
bridge
one
sees
a
small
village
huddled
between
the
stream
and
the
vertical
slope
of
round
mountain
and
wonders
at
the
cluster
of
rotting
gambrel
roofs
bespeaking
an
earlier
architectural
period
than
that
of
the
neighboring
region
it
is
not
reassuring
to
see
on
a
closer
glance
that
most
of
the
houses
are
deserted
and
falling
to
ruin
and
that
the
broken-steepled
church
now
harbors
the
one
slovenly
mercantile
establishment
of
the
hamlet
one
dreads
to
trust
the
tenebrous
tunnel
of
the
bridge
yet
there
is
no
way
to
avoid
it
once
across
it
is
hard
to
prevent
the
impression
of
a
faint
malign
odor
about
the
village
street
as
of
the
massed
mold
and
decay
of
centuries
it
is
always
a
relief
to
get
clear
of
the
place
and
to
follow
the
narrow
road
around
the
base
of
the
hills
and
across
the
level
country
beyond
till
it
rejoins
the
aylesbury
pike
afterward
one
sometimes
learns
that
one
has
been
through
dunwich
outsiders
visit
dunwich
as
seldom
as
possible
and
since
a
certain
season
of
horror
all
the
signboards
pointing
toward
it
have
been
taken
down
the
scenery
judged
by
any
ordinary
esthetic
canon
is
more
than
commonly
beautiful
yet
there
is
no
influx
of
artists
or
summer
tourists
two
centuries
ago
when
talk
of
witch-blood
satan-worship
and
strange
forest
presences
was
not
laughed
at
it
was
the
custom
to
give
reasons
for
avoiding
the
locality
in
our
sensible
age--since
the
dunwich
horror
of
1928
was
hushed
up
by
those
who
had
the
town's
and
the
world's
welfare
at
heart--people
shun
it
without
knowing
exactly
why
perhaps
one
reason--though
it
can
not
apply
to
uninformed
strangers--is
that
the
natives
are
now
repellently
decadent
having
gone
far
along
that
path
of
retrogression
so
common
in
many
new
england
backwaters
they
have
come
to
form
a
race
by
themselves
with
the
well-defined
mental
and
physical
stigmata
of
degeneracy
and
inbreeding
the
average
of
their
intelligence
is
wofully
low
whilst
their
annals
reek
of
overt
viciousness
and
of
half-hidden
murders
incests
and
deeds
of
almost
unnamable
violence
and
perversity
the
old
gentry
representing
the
two
or
three
armigerous
families
which
came
from
salem
in
1692
have
kept
somewhat
above
the
general
level
of
decay
though
many
branches
are
sunk
into
the
sordid
populace
so
deeply
that
only
their
names
remain
as
a
key
to
the
origin
they
disgrace
some
of
the
whateleys
and
bishops
still
send
their
eldest
sons
to
harvard
and
miskatonic
though
those
sons
seldom
return
to
the
moldering
gambrel
roofs
under
which
they
and
their
ancestors
were
born
no
one
even
those
who
have
the
facts
concerning
the
recent
horror
can
say
just
what
is
the
matter
with
dunwich
though
old
legends
speak
of
unhallowed
rites
and
conclaves
of
the
indians
amidst
which
they
called
forbidden
shapes
of
shadow
out
of
the
great
rounded
hills
and
made
wild
orgiastic
prayers
that
were
answered
by
loud
crackings
and
rumblings
from
the
ground
below
in
1747
the
reverend
abijah
hoadley
newly
come
to
the
congregational
church
at
dunwich
village
preached
a
memorable
sermon
on
the
close
presence
of
satan
and
his
imps
in
which
he
said
it
must
be
allow'd
that
these
blasphemies
of
an
infernall
train
of
dã¦mons
are
matters
of
too
common
knowledge
to
be
deny'd
the
cursed
voices
of
azazel
and
buzrael
of
beelzebub
and
belial
being
heard
from
under
ground
by
above
a
score
of
credible
witnesses
now
living
i
myself
did
not
more
than
a
fortnight
ago
catch
a
very
plain
discourse
of
evill
powers
in
the
hill
behind
my
house
wherein
there
were
a
rattling
and
rolling
groaning
screeching
and
hissing
such
as
no
things
of
this
earth
cou'd
raise
up
and
which
must
needs
have
come
from
those
caves
that
only
black
magick
can
discover
and
only
the
divell
unlock
mr
hoadley
disappeared
soon
after
delivering
this
sermon
but
the
text
printed
in
springfield
is
still
extant
noises
in
the
hills
continued
to
be
reported
from
year
to
year
and
still
form
a
puzzle
to
geologists
and
physiographers
other
traditions
tell
of
foul
odors
near
the
hill-crowning
circles
of
stone
pillars
and
of
rushing
airy
presences
to
be
heard
faintly
at
certain
hours
from
stated
points
at
the
bottom
of
the
great
ravines
while
still
others
try
to
explain
the
devil's
hop
yard--a
bleak
blasted
hillside
where
no
tree
shrub
or
grass-blade
will
grow
then
too
the
natives
are
mortally
afraid
of
the
numerous
whippoorwills
which
grow
vocal
on
warm
nights
it
is
vowed
that
the
birds
are
psychopomps
lying
in
wait
for
the
souls
of
the
dying
and
that
they
time
their
eery
cries
in
unison
with
the
sufferer's
struggling
breath
if
they
can
catch
the
fleeing
soul
when
it
leaves
the
body
they
instantly
flutter
away
chittering
in
demoniac
laughter
but
if
they
fail
they
subside
gradually
into
a
disappointed
silence
these
tales
of
course
are
obsolete
and
ridiculous
because
they
come
down
from
very
old
times
dunwich
is
indeed
ridiculously
old--older
by
far
than
any
of
the
communities
within
thirty
miles
of
it
south
of
the
village
one
may
still
spy
the
cellar
walls
and
chimney
of
the
ancient
bishop
house
which
was
built
before
1700
whilst
the
ruins
of
the
mill
at
the
falls
built
in
1806
form
the
most
modern
piece
of
architecture
to
be
seen
industry
did
not
flourish
here
and
the
nineteenth
century
factory
movement
proved
short-lived
oldest
of
all
are
the
great
rings
of
rough-hewn
stone
columns
on
the
hilltops
but
these
are
more
generally
attributed
to
the
indians
than
to
the
settlers
deposits
of
skulls
and
bones
found
within
these
circles
and
around
the
sizable
table-like
rock
on
sentinel
hill
sustain
the
popular
belief
that
such
spots
were
once
the
burial-places
of
the
pocumtucks
even
though
many
ethnologists
disregarding
the
absurd
improbability
of
such
a
theory
persist
in
believing

it
was
in
the
township
of
dunwich
in
a
large
and
partly
inhabited
farmhouse
set
against
a
hillside
four
miles
from
the
village
and
a
mile
and
a
half
from
any
other
dwelling
that
wilbur
whateley
was
born
at
5
a
m
on
sunday
the
second
of
february
1913
this
date
was
recalled
because
it
was
candlemas
which
people
in
dunwich
curiously
observe
under
another
name
and
because
the
noises
in
the
hills
had
sounded
and
all
the
dogs
of
the
countryside
had
barked
persistently
throughout
the
night
before
less
worthy
of
notice
was
the
fact
that
the
mother
was
one
of
the
decadent
whateleys
a
somewhat
deformed
unattractive
albino
woman
of
35
living
with
an
aged
and
half-insane
father
about
whom
the
most
frightful
tales
of
wizardry
had
been
whispered
in
his
youth
lavinia
whateley
had
no
known
husband
but
according
to
the
custom
of
the
region
made
no
attempt
to
disavow
the
child
concerning
the
other
side
of
whose
ancestry
the
country
folk
might--and
did--speculate
as
widely
as
they
chose
on
the
contrary
she
seemed
strangely
proud
of
the
dark
goatish-looking
infant
who
formed
such
a
contrast
to
her
own
sickly
and
pink-eyed
albinism
and
was
heard
to
mutter
many
curious
prophecies
about
its
unusual
powers
and
tremendous
future
lavinia
was
one
who
would
be
apt
to
mutter
such
things
for
she
was
a
lone
creature
given
to
wandering
amidst
thunderstorms
in
the
hills
and
trying
to
read
the
great
odorous
books
which
her
father
had
inherited
through
two
centuries
of
whateleys
and
which
were
fast
falling
to
pieces
with
age
and
worm-holes
she
had
never
been
to
school
but
was
filled
with
disjointed
scraps
of
ancient
lore
that
old
whateley
had
taught
her
the
remote
farmhouse
had
always
been
feared
because
of
old
whateley's
reputation
for
black
magic
and
the
unexplained
death
by
violence
of
mrs
whateley
when
lavinia
was
twelve
years
old
had
not
helped
to
make
the
place
popular
isolated
among
strange
influences
lavinia
was
fond
of
wild
and
grandiose
daydreams
and
singular
occupations
nor
was
her
leisure
much
taken
up
by
household
cares
in
a
home
from
which
all
standards
of
order
and
cleanliness
had
long
since
disappeared
there
was
a
hideous
screaming
which
echoed
above
even
the
hill
noises
and
the
dogs'
barking
on
the
night
wilbur
was
born
but
no
known
doctor
or
midwife
presided
at
his
coming
neighbors
knew
nothing
of
him
till
a
week
afterward
when
old
whateley
drove
his
sleigh
through
the
snow
into
dunwich
village
and
discoursed
incoherently
to
the
group
of
loungers
at
osborn's
general
store
there
seemed
to
be
a
change
in
the
old
man--an
added
element
of
furtiveness
in
the
clouded
brain
which
subtly
transformed
him
from
an
object
to
a
subject
of
fear--though
he
was
not
one
to
be
perturbed
by
any
common
family
event
amidst
it
all
he
showed
some
trace
of
the
pride
later
noticed
in
his
daughter
and
what
he
said
of
the
child's
paternity
was
remembered
by
many
of
his
hearers
years
afterward
i
dun't
keer
what
folks
think--ef
lavinny's
boy
looked
like
his
pa
he
wouldn't
look
like
nothin'
ye
expeck
ye
needn't

folks'll
hear
a
child
o'
lavinny's
a-callin'
its
father's
name
on
the
top
o'
sentinel
hill
the
only
persons
who
saw
wilbur
during
the
first
month
of
his
life
were
old
zechariah
whateley
of
the
undecayed
whateleys
and
earl
sawyer's
common-law
wife
mamie
bishop
mamie's
visit
was
frankly
one
of
curiosity
and
her
subsequent
tales
did
justice
to
her
observations
but
zechariah
came
to
lead
a
pair
of
alderney
cows
which
old
whateley
had
bought
of
his
son
curtis
this
marked
the
beginning
of
a
course
of
cattle-buying
on
the
part
of
small
wilbur's
family
which
ended
only
in
1928
when
the
dunwich
horror
came
and
went
yet
at
no
time
did
the
ramshackle
whateley
barn
seem
over-crowded
with
livestock
there
came
a
period
when
people
were
curious
enough
to
steal
up
and
count
the
herd
that
grazed
precariously
on
the
steep
hillside
above
the
old
farmhouse
and
they
could
never
find
more
than
ten
or
twelve
anemic
bloodless-looking
specimens
evidently
some
blight
or
distemper
perhaps
sprung
from
the
unwholesome
pasturage
or
the
diseased
fungi
and
timbers
of
the
filthy
barn
caused
a
heavy
mortality
amongst
the
whateley
animals
odd
wounds
or
sores
having
something
of
the
aspect
of
incisions
seemed
to
afflict
the
visible
cattle
and
once
or
twice
during
the
earlier
months
certain
callers
fancied
they
could
discern
similar
sores
about
the
throats
of
the
gray
unshaven
old
man
and
his
slatternly
crinkly-haired
albino
daughter
in
the
spring
after
wilbur's
birth
lavinia
resumed
her
customary
rambles
in
the
hills
bearing
in
her
misproportioned
arms
the
swarthy
child
public
interest
in
the
whateleys
subsided
after
most
of
the
country
folk
had
seen
the
baby
and
no
one
bothered
to
comment
on
the
swift
development
which
that
newcomer
seemed
every
day
to
exhibit
wilbur's
growth
was
indeed
phenomenal
for
within
three
months
of
his
birth
he
had
attained
a
size
and
muscular
power
not
usually
found
in
infants
under
a
full
year
of
age
his
motions
and
even
his
vocal
sounds
showed
a
restraint
and
deliberateness
highly
peculiar
in
an
infant
and
no
one
was
really
unprepared
when
at
seven
months
he
began
to
walk
unassisted
with
falterings
which
another
month
was
sufficient
to
remove
it
was
somewhat
after
this
time--on
hallowe'en--that
a
great
blaze
was
seen
at
midnight
on
the
top
of
sentinel
hill
where
the
old
table-like
stone
stands
amidst
its
tumulus
of
ancient
bones
considerable
talk
was
started
when
silas
bishop--of
the
undecayed
bishops--mentioned
having
seen
the
boy
running
sturdily
up
that
hill
ahead
of
his
mother
about
an
hour
before
the
blaze
was
remarked
silas
was
rounding
up
a
stray
heifer
but
he
nearly
forgot
his
mission
when
he
fleetingly
spied
the
two
figures
in
the
dim
light
of
his
lantern
they
darted
almost
noiselessly
through
the
underbrush
and
the
astonished
watcher
seemed
to
think
they
were
entirely
unclothed
afterward
he
could
not
be
sure
about
the
boy
who
may
have
had
some
kind
of
a
fringed
belt
and
a
pair
of
dark
blue
trunks
or
trousers
on
wilbur
was
never
subsequently
seen
alive
and
conscious
without
complete
and
tightly
buttoned
attire
the
disarrangement
or
threatened
disarrangement
of
which
always
seemed
to
fill
him
with
anger
and
alarm
his
contrast
with
his
squalid
mother
and
grandfather
in
this
respect
was
thought
very
notable
until
the
horror
of
1928
suggested
the
most
valid
of
reasons
the
next
january
gossips
were
mildly
interested
in
the
fact
that
lavinny's
black
brat
had
commenced
to
talk
and
at
the
age
of
only
eleven
months
his
speech
was
somewhat
remarkable
both
because
of
its
difference
from
the
ordinary
accents
of
the
region
and
because
it
displayed
a
freedom
from
infantile
lisping
of
which
many
children
of
three
or
four
might
well
be
proud
the
boy
was
not
talkative
yet
when
he
spoke
he
seemed
to
reflect
some
elusive
element
wholly
unpossessed
by
dunwich
and
its
denizens
the
strangeness
did
not
reside
in
what
he
said
or
even
in
the
simple
idioms
he
used
but
seemed
vaguely
linked
with
his
intonation
or
with
the
internal
organs
that
produced
the
spoken
sounds
his
facial
aspect
too
was
remarkable
for
its
maturity
for
though
he
shared
his
mother's
and
grandfather's
chinlessness
his
firm
and
precociously
shaped
nose
united
with
the
expression
on
his
large
dark
almost
latin
eyes
to
give
him
an
air
of
quasi-adulthood
and
well-nigh
preternatural
intelligence
he
was
however
exceedingly
ugly
despite
his
appearance
of
brilliancy
there
being
something
almost
goatish
or
animalistic
about
his
thick
lips
large-pored
yellowish
skin
coarse
crinkly
hair
and
oddly
elongated
ears
he
was
soon
disliked
even
more
decidedly
than
his
mother
and
grandsire
and
all
conjectures
about
him
were
spiced
with
references
to
the
bygone
magic
of
old
whateley
and
how
the
hills
once
shook
when
he
shrieked
the
dreadful
name
of
yog-sothoth
in
the
midst
of
a
circle
of
stones
with
a
great
book
open
in
his
arms
before
him
dogs
abhorred
the
boy
and
he
was
always
obliged
to
take
various
defensive
measures
against
their
barking
menace
3
meanwhile
old
whateley
continued
to
buy
cattle
without
measurably
increasing
the
size
of
his
herd
he
also
cut
timber
and
began
to
repair
the
unused
parts
of
his
house--a
spacious
peaked-roofed
affair
whose
rear
end
was
buried
entirely
in
the
rocky
hillside
and
whose
three
least-ruined
ground-floor
rooms
had
always
been
sufficient
for
himself
and
his
daughter
there
must
have
been
prodigious
reserves
of
strength
in
the
old
man
to
enable
him
to
accomplish
so
much
hard
labor
and
though
he
still
babbled
dementedly
at
times
his
carpentry
seemed
to
show
the
effects
of
sound
calculation
it
had
really
begun
as
soon
as
wilbur
was
born
when
one
of
the
many
tool-sheds
had
been
put
suddenly
in
order
clapboarded
and
fitted
with
a
stout
fresh
lock
now
in
restoring
the
abandoned
upper
story
of
the
house
he
was
a
no
less
thorough
craftsman
his
mania
showed
itself
only
in
his
tight
boarding-up
of
all
the
windows
in
the
reclaimed
section--though
many
declared
that
it
was
a
crazy
thing
to
bother
with
the
reclamation
at
all
less
inexplicable
was
his
fitting-up
of
another
downstairs
room
for
his
new
grandson--a
room
which
several
callers
saw
though
no
one
was
ever
admitted
to
the
closely-boarded
upper
story
this
chamber
he
lined
with
tall
firm
shelving
along
which
he
began
gradually
to
arrange
in
apparently
careful
order
all
the
rotting
ancient
books
and
parts
of
books
which
during
his
own
day
had
been
heaped
promiscuously
in
odd
corners
of
the
various
rooms
i
made
some
use
of
'em
he
would
say
as
he
tried
to
mend
a
torn
black-letter
page
with
paste
prepared
on
the
rusty
kitchen
stove
but
the
boy's
fitten
to
make
better
use
of
'em
he'd
orter
hev
'em
as
well
sot
as
he
kin
for
they're
goin'
to
be
all
of
his
larnin'
when
wilbur
was
a
year
and
seven
months
old--in
september
of
1914--his
size
and
accomplishments
were
almost
alarming
he
had
grown
as
large
as
a
child
of
four
and
was
a
fluent
and
incredibly
intelligent
talker
he
ran
freely
about
the
fields
and
hills
and
accompanied
his
mother
on
all
her
wanderings
at
home
he
would
pore
diligently
over
the
queer
pictures
and
charts
in
his
grandfather's
books
while
old
whateley
would
instruct
and
catechize
him
through
long
hushed
afternoons
by
this
time
the
restoration
of
the
house
was
finished
and
those
who
watched
it
wondered
why
one
of
the
upper
windows
had
been
made
into
a
solid
plank
door
it
was
a
window
in
the
rear
of
the
east
gable
end
close
against
the
hill
and
no
one
could
imagine
why
a
cleated
wooden
runway
was
built
up
to
it
from
the
ground
about
the
period
of
this
work's
completion
people
noticed
that
the
old
tool-house
tightly
locked
and
windowlessly
clapboarded
since
wilbur's
birth
had
been
abandoned
again
the
door
swung
listlessly
open
and
when
earl
sawyer
once
stepped
within
after
a
cattle-selling
call
on
old
whateley
he
was
quite
discomposed
by
the
singular
odor
he
encountered--such
a
stench
he
averred
as
he
had
never
before
smelt
in
all
his
life
except
near
the
indian
circles
on
the
hills
and
which
could
not
come
from
anything
sane
or
of
this
earth
but
then
the
homes
and
sheds
of
dunwich
folk
have
never
been
remarkable
for
olfactory
immaculateness
the
following
months
were
void
of
visible
events
save
that
everyone
swore
to
a
slow
but
steady
increase
in
the
mysterious
hill
noises
on
may
eve
of
1915
there
were
tremors
which
even
the
aylesbury
people
felt
whilst
the
following
hallowe'en
produced
an
underground
rumbling
queerly
synchronized
with
bursts
of
flame--them
witch
whateleys'
doin's--from
the
summit
of
sentinel
hill
wilbur
was
growing
up
uncannily
so
that
he
looked
like
a
boy
of
ten
as
he
entered
his
fourth
year
he
read
avidly
by
himself
now
but
talked
much
less
than
formerly
a
settled
taciturnity
was
absorbing
him
and
for
the
first
time
people
began
to
speak
specifically
of
the
dawning
look
of
evil
in
his
goatish
face
he
would
sometimes
mutter
an
unfamiliar
jargon
and
chant
in
bizarre
rhythms
which
chilled
the
listener
with
a
sense
of
unexplainable
terror
the
aversion
displayed
toward
him
by
dogs
had
now
become
a
matter
of
wide
remark
and
he
was
obliged
to
carry
a
pistol
in
order
to
traverse
the
countryside
in
safety
his
occasional
use
of
the
weapon
did
not
enhance
his
popularity
amongst
the
owners
of
canine
guardians
the
few
callers
at
the
house
would
often
find
lavinia
alone
on
the
ground
floor
while
odd
cries
and
footsteps
resounded
in
the
boarded-up
second
story
she
would
never
tell
what
her
father
and
the
boy
were
doing
up
there
though
once
she
turned
pale
and
displayed
an
abnormal
degree
of
fear
when
a
jocose
fish-peddler
tried
the
locked
door
leading
to
the
stairway
that
peddler
told
the
store
loungers
at
dunwich
village
that
he
thought
he
heard
a
horse
stamping
on
that
floor
above
the
loungers
reflected
thinking
of
the
door
and
runway
and
of
the
cattle
that
so
swiftly
disappeared
then
they
shuddered
as
they
recalled
tales
of
old
whateley's
youth
and
of
the
strange
things
that
are
called
out
of
the
earth
when
a
bullock
is
sacrificed
at
the
proper
time
to
certain
heathen
gods
it
had
for
some
time
been
noticed
that
dogs
had
begun
to
hate
and
fear
the
whole
whateley
place
as
violently
as
they
hated
and
feared
young
wilbur
personally
in
1917
the
war
came
and
squire
sawyer
whateley
as
chairman
of
the
local
draft
board
had
hard
work
finding
a
quota
of
young
dunwich
men
fit
even
to
be
sent
to
a
development
camp
the
government
alarmed
at
such
signs
of
wholesale
regional
decadence
sent
several
officers
and
medical
experts
to
investigate
conducting
a
survey
which
new
england
newspaper
readers
may
still
recall
it
was
the
publicity
attending
this
investigation
which
set
reporters
on
the
track
of
the
whateleys
and
caused
the
boston
globe
and
arkham
advertiser
to
print
flamboyant
sunday
stories
of
young
wilbur's
precociousness
old
whateley's
black
magic
the
shelves
of
strange
books
the
sealed
second
story
of
the
ancient
farmhouse
and
the
weirdness
of
the
whole
region
and
its
hill
noises
wilbur
was
four
and
a
half
then
and
looked
like
a
lad
of
fifteen
his
lip
and
cheek
were
fuzzy
with
a
coarse
dark
down
and
his
voice
had
begun
to
break
earl
sawyer
went
out
to
the
whateley
place
with
both
sets
of
reporters
and
camera
men
and
called
their
attention
to
the
queer
stench
which
now
seemed
to
trickle
down
from
the
sealed
upper
spaces
it
was
he
said
exactly
like
a
smell
he
had
found
in
the
tool-shed
abandoned
when
the
house
was
finally
repaired
and
like
the
faint
odors
which
he
sometimes
thought
he
caught
near
the
stone
circles
on
the
mountains
dunwich
folk
read
the
stories
when
they
appeared
and
grinned
over
the
obvious
mistakes
they
wondered
too
why
the
writers
made
so
much
of
the
fact
that
old
whateley
always
paid
for
his
cattle
in
gold
pieces
of
extremely
ancient
date
the
whateleys
had
received
their
visitors
with
ill-concealed
distaste
though
they
did
not
dare
court
further
publicity
by
a
violent
resistance
or
refusal
to
talk
4
for
a
decade
the
annals
of
the
whateleys
sink
indistinguishably
into
the
general
life
of
a
morbid
community
used
to
their
queer
ways
and
hardened
to
their
may
eve
and
all-hallow
orgies
twice
a
year
they
would
light
fires
on
the
top
of
sentinel
hill
at
which
times
the
mountain
rumblings
would
recur
with
greater
and
greater
violence
while
at
all
seasons
there
were
strange
and
portentous
doings
at
the
lonely
farmhouse
in
the
course
of
time
callers
professed
to
hear
sounds
in
the
sealed
upper
story
even
when
all
the
family
were
downstairs
and
they
wondered
how
swiftly
or
how
lingeringly
a
cow
or
bullock
was
usually
sacrificed
there
was
talk
of
a
complaint
to
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
but
nothing
ever
came
of
it
since
dunwich
folk
are
never
anxious
to
call
the
outside
world's
attention
to
themselves
about
1923
when
wilbur
was
a
boy
of
ten
whose
mind
voice
stature
and
bearded
face
gave
all
the
impressions
of
maturity
a
second
great
siege
of
carpentry
went
on
at
the
old
house
it
was
all
inside
the
sealed
upper
part
and
from
bits
of
discarded
lumber
people
concluded
that
the
youth
and
his
grandfather
had
knocked
out
all
the
partitions
and
even
removed
the
attic
floor
leaving
only
one
vast
open
void
between
the
ground
story
and
the
peaked
roof
they
had
torn
down
the
great
central
chimney
too
and
fitted
the
rusty
range
with
a
flimsy
outside
tin
stove-pipe
in
the
spring
after
this
event
old
whateley
noticed
the
growing
number
of
whippoorwills
that
would
come
out
of
cold
spring
glen
to
chirp
under
his
window
at
night
he
seemed
to
regard
the
circumstance
as
one
of
great
significance
and
told
the
loungers
at
osborn's
that
he
thought
his
time
had
almost
come

sometimes
on

night
1924
dr
houghton
of
aylesbury
was
hastily
summoned
by
wilbur
whateley
who
had
lashed
his
one
remaining
horse
through
the
darkness
and
telephoned
from
osborn's
in
the
village
he
found
old
whateley
in
a
very
grave
state
with
a
cardiac
action
and
stertorous
breathing
that
told
of
an
end
not
far
off
the
shapeless
albino
daughter
and
oddly
bearded
grandson
stood
by
the
bedside
whilst
from
the
vacant
abyss
overhead
there
came
a
disquieting
suggestion
of
rhythmical
surging
or
lapping
as
of
the
waves
on
some
level
beach
the
doctor
though
was
chiefly
disturbed
by
the
chattering
night
birds
outside
a
seemingly
limitless
legion
of
whippoorwills
that
cried
their
endless
message
in
repetitions
timed
diabolically
to
the
wheezing
gasps
of
the
dying
man
it
was
uncanny
and
unnatural--too
much
thought
dr
houghton
like
the
whole
of
the
region
he
had
entered
so
reluctantly
in
response
to
the
urgent
call
toward
1
o'clock
old
whateley
gained
consciousness
and
interrupted
his
wheezing
to
choke
out
a
few
words
to
his
grandson
more

with
the
long

of

edition
an'
then
put
a
match
to
the
prison
fire
from
airth
can't
burn
it
nohaow
he
was
obviously
quite
mad
after
a
pause
during
which
the
flock
of
whippoorwills
outside
adjusted
their
cries
to
the
altered
tempo
while
some
indications
of
the
strange
hill
noises
came
from
afar
off
he
added
another
sentence
or
two

uns
as
wants
to

but
speech
gave
place
to
gasps
again
and
lavinia
screamed
at
the
way
the
whippoorwills
followed
the
change
it
was
the
same
for
more
than
an
hour
when
the
final
throaty
rattle
came
dr
houghton
drew
shrunken
lids
over
the
glazing
gray
eyes
as
the
tumult
of
birds
faded
imperceptibly
to
silence
lavinia
sobbed
but
wilbur
only
chuckled
whilst
the
hill
noises
rumbled
faintly
they
didn't
git
him
he
muttered
in
his
heavy
bass
voice
wilbur
was
by
this
time
a
scholar
of
really
tremendous
erudition
in
his
one-sided
way
and
was
quietly
known
by
correspondence
to
many
librarians
in
distant
places
where
rare
and
forbidden
books
of
old
days
are
kept
he
was
more
and
more
hated
and
dreaded
around
dunwich
because
of
certain
youthful
disappearances
which
suspicion
laid
vaguely
at
his
door
but
was
always
able
to
silence
inquiry
through
fear
or
through
use
of
that
fund
of
old-time
gold
which
still
as
in
his
grandfather's
time
went
forth
regularly
and
increasingly
for
cattle-buying
he
was
now
tremendously
mature
of
aspect
and
his
height
having
reached
the
normal
adult
limit
seemed
inclined
to
wax
beyond
that
figure
in
1925
when
a
scholarly
correspondent
from
miskatonic
university
called
upon
him
one
day
and
departed
pale
and
puzzled
he
was
fully
six
and
three-quarters
feet
tall
through
all
the
years
wilbur
had
treated
his
half-deformed
albino
mother
with
a
growing
contempt
finally
forbidding
her
to
go
to
the
hills
with
him
on
may
eve
and
hallowmass
and
in
1926
the
poor
creature
complained
to
mamie
bishop
of
being
afraid
of
him
they's
more
abaout
him
as
i
knows
than
i
kin
tell
ye
mamie
she
said
an'
naowadays
they's
more
nor
what
i
know
myself
i
vaow
afur
gawd
i
dun't
know
what
he
wants
nor
what
he's
a-tryin'
to
dew
that
hallowe'en
the
hill
noises
sounded
louder
than
ever
and
fire
burned
on
sentinel
hill
as
usual
but
people
paid
more
attention
to
the
rhythmical
screaming
of
vast
flocks
of
unnaturally
belated
whippoorwills
which
seemed
to
be
assembled
near
the
unlighted
whateley
farmhouse
after
midnight
their
shrill
notes
burst
into
a
kind
of
pandemoniac
cachinnation
which
filled
all
the
countryside
and
not
until
dawn
did
they
finally
quiet
down
then
they
vanished
hurrying
southward
where
they
were
fully
a
month
overdue
what
this
meant
no
one
could
quite
be
certain
till
later
none
of
the
countryfolk
seemed
to
have
died--but
poor
lavinia
whateley
the
twisted
albino
was
never
seen
again
in
the
summer
of
1927
wilbur
repaired
two
sheds
in
the
farmyard
and
began
moving
his
books
and
effects
out
to
them
soon
afterward
earl
sawyer
told
the
loungers
at
osborn's
that
more
carpentry
was
going
on
in
the
whateley
farmhouse
wilbur
was
closing
all
the
doors
and
windows
on
the
ground
floor
and
seemed
to
be
taking
out
partitions
as
he
and
his
grandfather
had
done
upstairs
four
years
before
he
was
living
in
one
of
the
sheds
and
sawyer
thought
he
seemed
unusually
worried
and
tremulous
people
generally
suspected
him
of
knowing
something
about
his
mother's
disappearance
and
very
few
ever
approached
his
neighborhood
now
his
height
had
increased
to
more
than
seven
feet
and
showed
no
signs
of
ceasing
its
development
5
the
following
winter
brought
an
event
no
less
strange
than
wilbur's
first
trip
outside
the
dunwich
region
correspondence
with
the
widener
library
at
harvard
the
bibliotheque
nationale
in
paris
the
british
museum
the
university
of
buenos
aires
and
the
library
of
miskatonic
university
at
arkham
had
failed
to
get
him
the
loan
of
a
book
he
desperately
wanted
so
at
length
he
set
out
in
person
shabby
dirty
bearded
and
uncouth
of
dialect
to
consult
the
copy
at
miskatonic
which
was
the
nearest
to
him
geographically
almost
eight
feet
tall
and
carrying
a
cheap
new
valise
from
osborn's
general
store
this
dark
and
goatish
gargoyle
appeared
one
day
in
arkham
in
quest
of
the
dreaded
volume
kept
under
lock
and
key
at
the
college
library--the
hideous
necronomicon
of
the
mad
arab
alhazred
in
olaus
wormius'
latin
version
as
printed
in
spain
in
the
seventeenth
century
he
had
never
seen
a
city
before
but
had
no
thought
save
to
find
his
way
to
the
university
grounds
where
indeed
he
passed
heedlessly
by
the
great
white-fanged
watchdog
that
barked
with
unnatural
fury
and
enmity
and
tugged
frantically
at
its
stout
chain
wilbur
had
with
him
the
priceless
but
imperfect
copy
of
dr
dee's
english
version
which
his
grandfather
had
bequeathed
him
and
upon
receiving
access
to
the
latin
copy
he
at
once
began
to
collate
the
two
texts
with
the
aim
of
discovering
a
certain
passage
which
would
have
come
on
the
751st
page
of
his
own
defective
volume
this
much
he
could
not
civilly
refrain
from
telling
the
librarian--the
same
erudite
henry
armitage
a
m
miskatonic
ph
d
princeton
litt
d
johns
hopkins
who
had
once
called
at
the
farm
and
who
now
politely
plied
him
with
questions
he
was
looking
he
had
to
admit
for
a
kind
of
formula
or
incantation
containing
the
frightful
name
yog-sothoth
and
it
puzzled
him
to
find
discrepancies
duplications
and
ambiguities
which
made
the
matter
of
determination
far
from
easy
as
he
copied
the
formula
he
finally
chose
dr
armitage
looked
involuntarily
over
his
shoulder
at
the
open
pages
the
left-hand
one
of
which
in
the
latin
version
contained
such
monstrous
threats
to
the
peace
and
sanity
of
the
world
nor
is
it
to
be
thought
ran
the
text
as
armitage
mentally
translated
it
that
man
is
either
the
oldest
or
the
last
of
earth's
masters
or
that
the
common
bulk
of
life
and
substance
walks
alone
the
old
ones
were
the
old
ones
are
and
the
old
ones
shall
be

the

we
know
but
between
them
they
walk
serene
and
primal
undimensioned
and
to
us
unseen

the

the
gate
yog-sothoth
is
the
key
and
guardian
of
the
gate

all
are
one
in

he
knows
where
the
old
ones
broke
through
of
old
and
where
they
shall
break
through
again
he
knows
where
they
have
trod
earth's
fields
and
where
they
still
tread
them
and
why
no
one
can
behold
them
as
they
tread
by
their
smell
can
men
sometimes
know
them
near
but
of
their
semblance
can
no
man
know
saving
only
in
the
features
of
those
they
have
begotten
on
mankind
and
of
those
are
there
many
sorts
differing
in
likeness
from
man's
truest
eidolon
to
that
shape
without
sight
or
substance
which
is
they
they
walk
unseen
and
foul
in
lonely
places
where
the
words
have
been
spoken
and
the
rites

through
at
their
seasons
the
wind

with
their
voices
and

with

dr
armitage
associating
what
he
was
reading
with
what
he
had
heard
of
dunwich
and
its
brooding
presences
and
of
wilbur
whateley
and
his
dim
hideous
aura
that
stretched
from
a
dubious
birth
to
a
cloud
of
probable
matricide
felt
a
wave
of
fright
as
tangible
as
a
draft
of
the
tomb's
cold
clamminess
the
bent
goatish
giant
before
him
seemed
like
the
spawn
of
another
planet
or
dimension
like
something
only
partly
of
mankind
and
linked
to
black
gulfs
of
essence
and
entity
that
stretch
like
titan
fantasms
beyond
all
spheres
of
force
and
matter
space
and
time
presently
wilbur
raised
his
head
and
began
speaking
in
that
strange
resonant
fashion
which
hinted
at
sound-producing
organs
unlike
the
run
of
mankind's
mr
armitage
he
said
i
calc'late
i've
got
to
take
that
book
home
they's
things
in
it
i've
got
to
try
under
sarten
conditions
that
i
can't
git
here
an'
it
'ud
be
a
mortal
sin
to
let
a
red-tape
rule
hold
me
up
let
me
take
it
along
sir
an'
i'll
swar
they
wun't
nobody
know
the
difference
i
dun't
need
to
tell
ye
i'll
take
good
keer
of
it
it
wa'n't
me
that
put
this
dee
copy
in
the
shape
it
is
he
stopped
as
he
saw
firm
denial
on
the
librarian's
face
and
his
own
goatish
features
grew
crafty
armitage
half
ready
to
tell
him
he
might
make
a
copy
of
what
parts
he
needed
thought
suddenly
of
the
possible
consequences
and
checked
himself
there
was
too
much
responsibility
in
giving
such
a
being
the
key
to
such
blasphemous
outer
spheres
whateley
saw
how
things
stood
and
tried
to
answer
lightly
wal
all
right
ef
ye
feel
that
way
abaout
it
maybe
harvard
wun't
be
so
fussy
as
yew
be
and
without
saying
more
he
rose
and
strode
out
of
the
building
stooping
at
each
doorway
armitage
heard
the
savage
yelping
of
the
great
watchdog
and
studied
whateley's
gorilla-like
lope
as
he
crossed
the
bit
of
campus
visible
from
the
window
he
thought
of
the
wild
tales
he
had
heard
and
recalled
the
old
sunday
stories
in
the
advertiser
these
things
and
the
lore
he
had
picked
up
from
dunwich
rustics
and
villagers
during
his
one
visit
there
unseen
things
not
of
earth--or
at
least
not
of
tri-dimensional
earth--rushed
fetid
and
horrible
through
new
england's
glens
and
brooded
obscenely
on
the
mountain
tops
of
this
he
had
long
felt
certain
now
he
seemed
to
sense
the
close
presence
of
some
terrible
part
of
the
intruding
horror
and
to
glimpse
a
hellish
advance
in
the
black
dominion
of
the
ancient
and
once
passive
nightmare
he
locked
away
the
necronomicon
with
a
shudder
of
disgust
but
the
room
still
reeked
with
an
unholy
and
unidentifiable
stench
as
a
foulness
shall
ye
know
them
he
quoted
yes--the
odor
was
the
same
as
that
which
had
sickened
him
at
the
whateley
farmhouse
less
than
three
years
before
he
thought
of
wilbur
goatish
and
ominous
once
again
and
laughed
mockingly
at
the
village
rumors
of
his
parentage
inbreeding
armitage
muttered
half
aloud
to
himself
great
god
what
simpletons
show
them
arthur
machen's
great
god
pan
and
they'll
think
it
a
common
dunwich
scandal
but
what
thing--what
cursed
shapeless
influence
on
or
off
this
three-dimensioned
earth--was
wilbur
whateley's
father
born
on
candlemas--nine
months
after
may
eve
of
1912
when
the
talk
about
the
queer
earth
noises
reached
clear
to
arkham--what
walked
on
the
mountains
that
may
night
what
roodmas
horror
fastened
itself
on
the
world
in
half-human
flesh
and
blood
during
the
ensuing
weeks
dr
armitage
set
about
to
collect
all
possible
data
on
wilbur
whateley
and
the
formless
presences
around
dunwich
he
got
in
communication
with
dr
houghton
of
aylesbury
who
had
attended
old
whateley
in
his
last
illness
and
found
much
to
ponder
over
in
the
grandfather's
last
words
as
quoted
by
the
physician
a
visit
to
dunwich
village
failed
to
bring
out
much
that
was
new
but
a
close
survey
of
the
necronomicon
in
those
parts
which
wilbur
had
sought
so
avidly
seemed
to
supply
new
and
terrible
clues
to
the
nature
methods
and
desires
of
the
strange
evil
so
vaguely
threatening
this
planet
talks
with
several
students
of
archaic
lore
in
boston
and
letters
to
many
others
elsewhere
gave
him
a
growing
amazement
which
passed
slowly
through
varied
degrees
of
alarm
to
a
state
of
really
acute
spiritual
fear
as
the
summer
drew
on
he
felt
dimly
that
something
ought
to
be
done
about
the
lurking
terrors
of
the
upper
miskatonic
valley
and
about
the
monstrous
being
known
to
the
human
world
as
wilbur
whateley
6
the
dunwich
horror
itself
came
between
lammas
and
the
equinox
in
1928
and
dr
armitage
was
among
those
who
witnessed
its
monstrous
prologue
he
had
heard
meanwhile
of
whateley's
grotesque
trip
to
cambridge
and
of
his
frantic
efforts
to
borrow
or
copy
from
the
necronomicon
at
the
widener
library
those
efforts
had
been
in
vain
since
armitage
had
issued
warnings
of
the
keenest
intensity
to
all
librarians
having
charge
of
the
dreaded
volume
wilbur
had
been
shockingly
nervous
at
cambridge
anxious
for
the
book
yet
almost
equally
anxious
to
get
home
again
as
if
he
feared
the
results
of
being
away
long
early
in
august
the
half-expected
outcome
developed
and
in
the
small
hours
of
the
third
dr
armitage
was
awakened
suddenly
by
the
wild
fierce
cries
of
the
savage
watchdog
on
the
college
campus
deep
and
terrible
the
snarling
half-mad
growls
and
barks
continued
always
in
mounting
volume
but
with
hideously
significant
pauses
then
there
rang
out
a
scream
from
a
wholly
different
throat--such
a
scream
as
roused
half
the
sleepers
of
arkham
and
haunted
their
dreams
ever
afterward--such
a
scream
as
could
come
from
no
being
born
of
earth
or
wholly
of
earth
armitage
hastened
into
some
clothing
and
rushed
across
the
street
and
lawn
to
the
college
buildings
saw
that
others
were
ahead
of
him
and
heard
the
echoes
of
a
burglar-alarm
still
shrilling
from
the
library
an
open
window
showed
black
and
gaping
in
the
moonlight
what
had
come
had
indeed
completed
its
entrance
for
the
barking
and
the
screaming
now
fast
fading
into
a
mixed
low
growling
and
moaning
proceeded
unmistakably
from
within
some
instinct
warned
armitage
that
what
was
taking
place
was
not
a
thing
for
unfortified
eyes
to
see
so
he
brushed
back
the
crowd
with
authority
as
he
unlocked
the
vestibule
door
among
the
others
he
saw
professor
warren
rice
and
dr
francis
morgan
men
to
whom
he
had
told
some
of
his
conjectures
and
misgivings
and
these
two
he
motioned
to
accompany
him
inside
the
inward
sounds
except
for
a
watchful
droning
whine
from
the
dog
had
by
this
time
quite
subsided
but
armitage
now
perceived
with
a
sudden
start
that
a
loud
chorus
of
whippoorwills
among
the
shrubbery
had
commenced
a
damnably
rhythmical
piping
as
if
in
unison
with
the
last
breath
of
a
dying
man
the
building
was
full
of
a
frightful
stench
which
dr
armitage
knew
too
well
and
the
three
men
rushed
across
the
hall
to
the
small
genealogical
reading-room
whence
the
low
whining
came
for
a
second
nobody
dared
to
turn
on
the
light
then
armitage
summoned
up
his
courage
and
snapped
the
switch
one
of
the
three--it
is
not
certain
which--shrieked
aloud
at
what
sprawled
before
them
among
disordered
tables
and
overturned
chairs
professor
rice
declares
that
he
wholly
lost
consciousness
for
an
instant
though
he
did
not
stumble
or
fall
the
thing
that
lay
half-bent
on
its
side
in
a
fetid
pool
of
greenish-yellow
ichor
and
tarry
stickiness
was
almost
nine
feet
tall
and
the
dog
had
torn
off
all
the
clothing
and
some
of
the
skin
it
was
not
quite
dead
but
twitched
silently
and
spasmodically
while
its
chest
heaved
in
monstrous
unison
with
the
mad
piping
of
the
expectant
whippoorwills
outside
bits
of
shoe-leather
and
fragments
of
apparel
were
scattered
about
the
room
and
just
inside
the
window
an
empty
canvas
sack
lay
where
it
had
evidently
been
thrown
near
the
central
desk
a
revolver
had
fallen
a
dented
but
undischarged
cartridge
later
explaining
why
it
had
not
been
fired
the
thing
itself
however
crowded
out
all
other
images
at
the
time
it
would
be
trite
and
not
wholly
accurate
to
say
that
no
human
pen
could
describe
it
but
one
may
properly
say
that
it
could
not
be
vividly
visualized
by
anyone
whose
ideas
of
aspect
and
contour
are
too
closely
bound
up
with
the
common
life-forms
of
this
planet
and
of
the
three
known
dimensions
it
was
partly
human
beyond
a
doubt
with
very
manlike
hands
and
head
and
the
goatish
chinless
face
had
the
stamp
of
the
whateleys
upon
it
but
the
torso
and
lower
parts
of
the
body
were
teratologically
fabulous
so
that
only
generous
clothing
could
ever
have
enabled
it
to
walk
on
earth
unchallenged
or
uneradicated
above
the
waist
it
was
semi-anthropomorphic
though
its
chest
where
the
dog's
rending
paws
still
rested
watchfully
had
the
leathery
reticulated
hide
of
a
crocodile
or
alligator
the
back
was
piebald
with
yellow
and
black
and
dimly
suggested
the
squamous
covering
of
certain
snakes
below
the
waist
though
it
was
the
worst
for
here
all
human
resemblance
left
off
and
sheer
fantasy
began
the
skin
was
thickly
covered
with
coarse
black
fur
and
from
the
abdomen
a
score
of
long
greenish-gray
tentacles
with
red
sucking
mouths
protruded
limply
their
arrangement
was
odd
and
seemed
to
follow
the
symmetries
of
some
cosmic
geometry
unknown
to
earth
or
the
solar
system
on
each
of
the
hips
deep
set
in
a
kind
of
pinkish
ciliated
orbit
was
what
seemed
to
be
a
rudimentary
eye
whilst
in
lieu
of
a
tail
there
depended
a
kind
of
trunk
or
feeler
with
purple
annular
markings
and
with
many
evidences
of
being
an
undeveloped
mouth
or
throat
the
limbs
save
for
their
black
fur
roughly
resembled
the
hind
legs
of
prehistoric
earth's
giant
saurians
and
terminated
in
ridgy-veined
pads
that
were
neither
hooves
nor
claws
when
the
thing
breathed
its
tail
and
tentacles
rhythmically
changed
color
as
if
from
some
circulatory
cause
normal
to
the
non-human
side
of
its
ancestry
in
the
tentacles
this
was
observable
as
a
deepening
of
the
greenish
tinge
whilst
in
the
tail
it
was
manifest
as
a
yellowish
appearance
which
alternated
with
a
sickly
grayish-white
in
the
spaces
between
the
purple
rings
of
genuine
blood
there
was
none
only
the
fetid
greenish-yellow
ichor
which
trickled
along
the
painted
floor
beyond
the
radius
of
the
stickiness
and
left
a
curious
discoloration
behind
it
as
the
presence
of
the
three
men
seemed
to
rouse
the
dying
thing
it
began
to
mumble
without
turning
or
raising
its
head
dr
armitage
made
no
written
record
of
its
mouthings
but
asserts
confidently
that
nothing
in
english
was
uttered
at
first
the
syllables
defied
all
correlation
with
any
speech
of
earth
but
toward
the
last
there
came
some
disjointed
fragments
evidently
taken
from
the
necronomicon
that
monstrous
blasphemy
in
quest
of
which
the
thing
had
perished
those
fragments
as
armitage
recalls
them
ran
something
like
n'gai
n'gha'ghaa
bugg-shoggog
y'hah
yog-sothoth
yog-sothoth
they
trailed
off
into
nothingness
as
the
whippoorwills
shrieked
in
rhythmical
crescendoes
of
unholy
anticipation
then
came
a
halt
in
the
gasping
and
the
dog
raised
his
head
in
a
long
lugubrious
howl
a
change
came
over
the
yellow
goatish
face
of
the
prostrate
thing
and
the
great
black
eyes
fell
in
appallingly
outside
the
window
the
shrilling
of
the
whippoorwills
had
suddenly
ceased
and
above
the
murmurs
of
the
gathering
crowd
there
came
the
sound
of
a
panic-struck
whirring
and
fluttering
against
the
moon
vast
clouds
of
feathery
watchers
rose
and
raced
from
sight
frantic
at
that
which
they
had
sought
for
prey
all
at
once
the
dog
started
up
abruptly
gave
a
frightened
bark
and
leaped
nervously
out
the
window
by
which
it
had
entered
a
cry
rose
from
the
crowd
and
dr
armitage
shouted
to
the
men
outside
that
no
one
must
be
admitted
till
the
police
or
medical
examiner
came
he
was
thankful
that
the
windows
were
just
too
high
to
permit
of
peering
in
and
drew
the
dark
curtains
carefully
down
over
each
one
by
this
time
two
policemen
had
arrived
and
dr
morgan
meeting
them
in
the
vestibule
was
urging
them
for
their
own
sakes
to
postpone
entrance
to
the
stench-filled
reading-room
till
the
examiner
came
and
the
prostrate
thing
could
be
covered
up
meanwhile
frightful
changes
were
taking
place
on
the
floor
one
need
not
describe
the
kind
and
rate
of
shrinkage
and
disintegration
that
occurred
before
the
eyes
of
dr
armitage
and
professor
rice
but
it
is
permissible
to
say
that
aside
from
the
external
appearance
of
face
and
hands
the
really
human
elements
in
wilbur
whateley
must
have
been
very
small
when
the
medical
examiner
came
there
was
only
a
sticky
whitish
mass
on
the
painted
boards
and
the
monstrous
odor
had
nearly
disappeared
apparently
whateley
had
had
no
skull
or
bony
skeleton
at
least
in
any
true
or
stable
sense
he
had
taken
somewhat
after
his
unknown
father
7
yet
all
this
was
only
the
prologue
of
the
actual
dunwich
horror
formalities
were
gone
through
by
bewildered
officials
abnormal
details
were
duly
kept
from
press
and
public
and
men
were
sent
to
dunwich
and
aylesbury
to
look
up
property
and
notify
any
who
might
be
heirs
of
the
late
wilbur
whateley
they
found
the
countryside
in
great
agitation
both
because
of
the
growing
rumblings
beneath
the
domed
hills
and
because
of
the
unwonted
stench
and
the
surging
lapping
sounds
which
came
increasingly
from
the
great
empty
shell
formed
by
whateley's
boarded-up
farmhouse
earl
sawyer
who
tended
the
horse
and
cattle
during
wilbur's
absence
had
developed
a
wofully
acute
case
of
nerves
the
officials
devised
excuses
not
to
enter
the
noisome
boarded
place
and
were
glad
to
confine
their
survey
of
the
deceased's
living
quarters
the
newly
mended
sheds
to
a
single
visit
they
filed
a
ponderous
report
at
the
court-house
in
aylesbury
and
litigations
concerning
heirship
are
said
to
be
still
in
progress
amongst
the
innumerable
whateleys
decayed
and
undecayed
of
the
upper
miskatonic
valley
an
almost
interminable
manuscript
in
strange
characters
written
in
a
huge
ledger
and
adjudged
a
sort
of
diary
because
of
the
spacing
and
the
variations
in
ink
and
penmanship
presented
a
baffling
puzzle
to
those
who
found
it
on
the
old
bureau
which
served
as
its
owner's
desk
after
a
week
of
debate
it
was
sent
to
miskatonic
university
together
with
the
deceased's
collection
of
strange
books
for
study
and
possible
translation
but
even
the
best
linguists
soon
saw
that
it
was
not
likely
to
be
unriddled
with
ease
no
trace
of
the
ancient
gold
with
which
wilbur
and
old
whateley
always
paid
their
debts
has
yet
been
discovered
it
was
in
the
dark
of
september
ninth
that
the
horror
broke
loose
the
hill
noises
had
been
very
pronounced
during
the
evening
and
dogs
barked
frantically
all
night
early
risers
on
the
tenth
noticed
a
peculiar
stench
in
the
air
about
7
o'clock
luther
brown
the
hired
boy
at
george
corey's
between
cold
spring
glen
and
the
village
rushed
frenziedly
back
from
his
morning
trip
to
ten-acre
meadow
with
the
cows
he
was
almost
convulsed
with
fright
as
he
stumbled
into
the
kitchen
and
in
the
yard
outside
the
no
less
frightened
herd
were
pawing
and
lowing
pitifully
having
followed
the
boy
back
in
the
panic
they
shared
with
him
between
gasps
luther
tried
to
stammer
out
his
tale
to
mrs
corey
up
thar
in

beyont

mis'

he
faltered
and
seemed
to
shiver
afresh
with
the
fright
that
had
sent
him
flying
home
mrs
corey
unable
to
extract
more
information
began
telephoning
the
neighbors
thus
starting
on
its
rounds
the
overture
of
panic
that
heralded
the
major
terrors
when
she
got
sally

at

chauncey
who
slept
poorly
had
been
up
on
the
hill
toward

and
had
dashed
back
in
terror
after
one
look
at
the
place
and
at
the
pasturage
where
mr

been
left

by
that
noon
fully
three-quarters
of
the
men
and
boys
of
dunwich
were
trooping
over
the
roads
and
meadows
between
the
new-made
whateley
ruins
and
cold
spring
glen
examining
in
horror
the
vast
monstrous
prints
the
maimed
bishop
cattle
the
strange
noisome
wreck
of
the
farmhouse
and
the
bruised
matted
vegetation
of
the
fields
and
road-sides
whatever
had
burst
loose
upon
the
world
had
assuredly
gone
down
into
the
great
sinister
ravine
for
all
the
trees
on
the
banks
were
bent
and
broken
and
a
great
avenue
had
been
gouged
in
the
precipice-hanging
underbrush
it
was
as
though
a
house
launched
by
an
avalanche
had
slid
down
through
the
tangled
growths
of
the
almost
vertical
slope
from
below
no
sound
came
but
only
a
distant
undefinable
fetor
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
men
preferred
to
stay
on
the
edge
and
argue
rather
than
descend
and
beard
the
unknown
cyclopean
horror
in
its
lair
three
dogs
that
were
with
the
party
had
barked
furiously
at
first
but
seemed
cowed
and
reluctant
when
near
the
glen
someone
telephoned
the
news
to
the
aylesbury
transcript
but
the
editor
accustomed
to
wild
tales
from
dunwich
did
no
more
than
concoct
a
humorous
paragraph
about
it
an
item
soon
afterward
reproduced
by
the
associated
press
that
night
everyone
went
home
and
every
house
and
barn
was
barricaded
as
stoutly
as
possible
needless
to
say
no
cattle
were
allowed
to
remain
in
open
pasturage
about
2
in
the
morning
a
frightful
stench
and
the
savage
barking
of
the
dogs
awakened
the
household
at
elmer
frye's
on
the
eastern
edge
of
cold
spring
glen
and
all
agreed
that
they
could
hear
a
sort
of
muffled
swishing
or
lapping
sound
from
somewhere
outside
mrs
frye
proposed
telephoning
the
neighbors
and
elmer
was
about
to
agree
when
the
noise
of
splintering
wood
burst
in
upon
their
deliberations
it
came
apparently
from
the
barn
and
was
quickly
followed
by
a
hideous
screaming
and
stamping
amongst
the
cattle
the
dogs
slavered
and
crouched
close
to
the
feet
of
the
fear-numbed
family
frye
lit
a
lantern
through
force
of
habit
but
knew
it
would
be
death
to
go
out
into
that
black
farmyard
the
children
and
the
women-folk
whimpered
kept
from
screaming
by
some
obscure
vestigial
instinct
of
defense
which
told
them
their
lives
depended
on
silence
at
last
the
noise
of
the
cattle
subsided
to
a
pitiful
moaning
and
a
great
snapping
crashing
and
crackling
ensued
the
fryes
huddled
together
in
the
sitting-room
did
not
dare
to
move
until
the
last
echoes
died
away
far
down
in
cold
spring
glen
then
amidst
the
dismal
moans
from
the
stable
and
the
demoniac
piping
of
late
whippoorwills
in
the
glen
selina
frye
tottered
to
the
telephone
and
spread
what
news
she
could
of
the
second
phase
of
the
horror
the
next
day
all
the
countryside
was
in
a
panic
and
cowed
uncommunicative
groups
came
and
went
where
the
fiendish
thing
had
occurred
two
titan
swaths
of
destruction
stretched
from
the
glen
to
the
frye
farmyard
monstrous
prints
covered
the
bare
patches
of
ground
and
one
side
of
the
old
red
barn
had
completely
caved
in
of
the
cattle
only
about
a
quarter
could
be
found
and
identified
some
of
these
were
in
curious
fragments
and
all
that
survived
had
to
be
shot
earl
sawyer
suggested
that
help
be
asked
from
aylesbury
or
arkham
but
others
maintained
it
would
be
of
no
use
old
zebulon
whateley
of
a
branch
that
hovered
about
half-way
between
soundness
and
decadence
made
darkly
wild
suggestions
about
rites
that
ought
to
be
practised
on
the
hilltops
he
came
of
a
line
where
tradition
ran
strong
and
his
memories
of
chantings
in
the
great
stone
circles
were
not
altogether
connected
with
wilbur
and
his
grandfather
darkness
fell
upon
a
stricken
countryside
too
passive
to
organize
for
real
defense
in
a
few
cases
closely
related
families
would
band
together
and
watch
in
the
gloom
under
one
roof
but
in
general
there
was
only
a
repetition
of
the
barricading
of
the
night
before
and
a
futile
ineffective
gesture
of
loading
muskets
and
setting
pitchforks
handily
about
nothing
however
occurred
except
some
hill
noises
and
when
the
day
came
there
were
many
who
hoped
that
the
new
horror
had
gone
as
swiftly
as
it
had
come
there
were
even
bold
souls
who
proposed
an
offensive
expedition
down
in
the
glen
though
they
did
not
venture
to
set
an
actual
example
to
the
still
reluctant
majority
when
night
came
again
the
barricading
was
repeated
though
there
was
less
huddling
together
of
families
in
the
morning
both
the
frye
and
the
seth
bishop
households
reported
excitement
among
the
dogs
and
vague
sounds
and
stenches
from
afar
while
early
explorers
noted
with
horror
a
fresh
set
of
the
monstrous
tracks
in
the
road
skirting
sentinel
hill
as
before
the
sides
of
the
road
showed
a
bruising
indicative
of
the
blasphemously
stupendous
bulk
of
the
horror
whilst
the
conformation
of
the
tracks
seemed
to
argue
a
passage
in
two
directions
as
if
the
moving
mountain
had
come
from
cold
spring
glen
and
returned
to
it
along
the
same
path
at
the
base
of
the
hill
a
thirty-foot
swath
of
crushed
shrubbery
and
saplings
led
steeply
upward
and
the
seekers
gasped
when
they
saw
that
even
the
most
perpendicular
places
did
not
deflect
the
inexorable
trail
whatever
the
horror
was
it
could
scale
a
sheer
stony
cliff
of
almost
complete
verticality
and
as
the
investigators
climbed
around
to
the
hill's
summit
by
safer
routes
they
saw
that
the
trail
ended--or
rather
reversed--there
it
was
here
that
the
whateleys
used
to
build
their
hellish
fires
and
chant
their
hellish
rituals
by
the
table-like
stone
on
may
eve
and
hallowmass
now
that
very
stone
formed
the
center
of
a
vast
space
thrashed
around
by
the
mountainous
horror
whilst
upon
its
slightly
concave
surface
was
a
thick
fetid
deposit
of
the
same
tarry
stickiness
observed
on
the
floor
of
the
ruined
whateley
farmhouse
when
the
horror
escaped
men
looked
at
one
another
and
muttered
then
they
looked
down
the
hill
apparently
the
horror
had
descended
by
a
route
much
the
same
as
that
of
its
ascent
to
speculate
was
futile
reason
logic
and
normal
ideas
of
motivation
stood
confounded
only
old
zebulon
who
was
not
with
the
group
could
have
done
justice
to
the
situation
or
suggested
a
plausible
explanation
thursday
night
began
much
like
the
others
but
it
ended
less
happily
the
whippoorwills
in
the
glen
had
screamed
with
such
unusual
persistence
that
many
could
not
sleep
and
about
3
a
m
all
the
party
telephones
rang
tremulously
those
who
took
down
their
receivers
heard
a
fright-mad
voice
shriek
out
help
oh
my
gawd
and
some
thought
a
crashing
sound
followed
the
breaking
off
of
the
exclamation
there
was
nothing
more
no
one
dared
do
anything
and
no
one
knew
till
morning
whence
the
call
came
then
those
who
had
heard
it
called
everyone
on
the
line
and
found
that
only
the
fryes
did
not
reply
the
truth
appeared
an
hour
later
when
a
hastily
assembled
group
of
armed
men
trudged
out
to
the
frye
place
at
the
head
of
the
glen
it
was
horrible
yet
hardly
a
surprize
there
were
more
swaths
and
monstrous
prints
but
there
was
no
longer
any
house
it
had
caved
in
like
an
egg-shell
and
amongst
the
ruins
nothing
living
or
dead
could
be
discovered--only
a
stench
and
a
tarry
stickiness
the
elmer
fryes
had
been
erased
from
dunwich
8
in
the
meantime
a
quieter
yet
even
more
spiritually
poignant
phase
of
the
horror
had
been
blackly
unwinding
itself
behind
the
closed
door
of
a
shelf-lined
room
in
arkham
the
curious
manuscript
record
or
diary
of
wilbur
whateley
delivered
to
miskatonic
university
for
translation
had
caused
much
worry
and
bafflement
among
the
experts
in
languages
both
ancient
and
modern
its
very
alphabet
notwithstanding
a
general
resemblance
to
the
heavily
shaded
arabic
used
in
mesopotamia
being
absolutely
unknown
to
any
available
authority
the
final
conclusion
of
the
linguists
was
that
the
text
represented
an
artificial
alphabet
giving
the
effect
of
a
cipher
though
none
of
the
usual
methods
of
cryptographic
solution
seemed
to
furnish
any
clue
even
when
applied
on
the
basis
of
every
tongue
the
writer
might
conceivably
have
used
the
ancient
books
taken
from
whateley's
quarters
while
absorbingly
interesting
and
in
several
cases
promising
to
open
up
new
and
terrible
lines
of
research
among
philosophers
and
men
of
science
were
of
no
assistance
whatever
in
this
matter
one
of
them
a
heavy
tome
with
an
iron
clasp
was
in
another
unknown
alphabet--this
one
of
a
very
different
cast
and
resembling
sanskrit
more
than
anything
else
the
old
ledger
was
at
length
given
wholly
into
the
charge
of
dr
armitage
both
because
of
his
peculiar
interest
in
the
whateley
matter
and
because
of
his
wide
linguistic
learning
and
skill
in
the
mystical
formulã¦
of
antiquity
and
the
middle
ages
armitage
had
an
idea
that
the
alphabet
might
be
something
esoterically
used
by
certain
forbidden
cults
which
have
come
down
from
old
times
and
which
have
inherited
many
forms
and
traditions
from
the
wizards
of
the
saracenic
world
that
question
however
he
did
not
deem
vital
since
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
know
the
origin
of
the
symbols
if
as
he
suspected
they
were
used
as
a
cipher
in
a
modern
language
it
was
his
belief
that
considering
the
great
amount
of
text
involved
the
writer
would
scarcely
have
wished
the
trouble
of
using
another
speech
than
his
own
save
perhaps
in
certain
special
formulã¦
and
incantations
accordingly
he
attacked
the
manuscript
with
the
preliminary
assumption
that
the
bulk
of
it
was
in
english
dr
armitage
knew
from
the
repeated
failures
of
his
colleagues
that
the
riddle
was
a
deep
and
complex
one
and
that
no
simple
mode
of
solution
could
merit
even
a
trial
all
through
late
august
he
fortified
himself
with
the
massed
lore
of
cryptography
drawing
upon
the
fullest
resources
of
his
own
library
and
wading
night
after
night
amidst
the
arcana
of
trithemius'
poligraphia
giambattista
porta's
de
furtivis
literarum
notis
de
vigenere's
traitã©
des
chiffres
falconer's
cryptomenysis
patefacta
davys'
and
thicknesse's
eighteenth
century
treatises
and
such
fairly
modern
authorities
as
blair
von
marten
and
klã¼ber's
kryptographik
he
interspersed
his
study
of
the
books
with
attacks
on
the
manuscript
itself
and
in
time
became
convinced
that
he
had
to
deal
with
one
of
those
subtlest
and
most
ingenious
of
cryptograms
in
which
many
separate
lists
of
corresponding
letters
are
arranged
like
the
multiplication
table
and
the
message
built
up
with
arbitrary
key-words
known
only
to
the
initiated
the
older
authorities
seemed
rather
more
helpful
than
the
newer
ones
and
armitage
concluded
that
the
code
of
the
manuscript
was
one
of
great
antiquity
no
doubt
handed
down
through
a
long
line
of
mystical
experimenters
several
times
he
seemed
near
daylight
only
to
be
set
back
by
some
unforeseen
obstacle
then
as
september
approached
the
clouds
began
to
clear
certain
letters
as
used
in
certain
parts
of
the
manuscript
emerged
definitely
and
unmistakably
and
it
became
obvious
that
the
text
was
indeed
in
english
on
the
evening
of
september
second
the
last
major
barrier
gave
way
and
dr
armitage
read
for
the
first
time
a
continuous
passage
of
wilbur
whateley's
annals
it
was
in
truth
a
diary
as
all
had
thought
and
it
was
couched
in
a
style
clearly
showing
the
mixed
occult
erudition
and
general
illiteracy
of
the
strange
being
who
wrote
it
almost
the
first
long
passage
that
armitage
deciphered
an
entry
dated
november
26
1916
proved
highly
startling
and
disquieting
it
was
written
he
remembered
by
a
child
of
three
and
a
half
who
looked
like
a
lad
of
twelve
or
thirteen
today
learned
the
aklo
for
the

it
ran
which
did
not
like
it
being
answerable
from
the
hill
and
not
from
the
air
that
upstairs
more

grandfather
kept
me
saying
the

last
night
and
i
think
i
saw

i

go

sabaoth
said
i
may
be
transfigured
there
being
much
of
outside
to
work
on
morning
found
dr
armitage
in
a
cold
sweat
of
terror
and
a
frenzy
of
wakeful
concentration
he
had
not
left
the
manuscript
all
night
but
sat
at
his
table
under
the
electric
light
turning
page
after
page
with
shaking
hands
as
fast
as
he
could
decipher
the
cryptic
text
he
had
nervously
telephoned
his
wife
he
would
not
be
home
and
when
she
brought
him
a
breakfast
from
the
house
he
could
scarcely
dispose
of
a
mouthful
all
that
day
he
read
on
now
and
then
halted
maddeningly
as
a
reapplication
of
the
complex
key
became
necessary
lunch
and
dinner
were
brought
him
but
he
ate
only
the
smallest
fraction
of
either
toward
the
middle
of
the
next
night
he
drowsed
off
in
his
chair
but
soon
woke
out
of
a
tangle
of
nightmares
almost
as
hideous
as
the
truths
and
menaces
to
man's
existence
that
he
had
uncovered
on
the
morning
of
september
fourth
professor
rice
and
dr
morgan
insisted
on
seeing
him
for
a
while
and
departed
trembling
and
ashen-gray
that
evening
he
went
to
bed
but
slept
only
fitfully
wednesday--the
next
day--he
was
back
at
the
manuscript
and
began
to
take
copious
notes
both
from
the
current
sections
and
from
those
he
had
already
deciphered
in
the
small
hours
of
that
night
he
slept
a
little
in
an
easy-chair
in
his
office
but
was
at
the
manuscript
again
before
dawn
some
time
before
noon
his
physician
dr
hartwell
called
to
see
him
and
insisted
that
he
cease
work
he
refused
intimating
that
it
was
of
the
most
vital
importance
for
him
to
complete
the
reading
of
the
diary
and
promising
an
explanation
in
due
course
of
time
that
evening
just
as
twilight
fell
he
finished
his
terrible
perusal
and
sank
back
exhausted
his
wife
bringing
his
dinner
found
him
in
a
half-comatose
state
but
he
was
conscious
enough
to
warn
her
off
with
a
sharp
cry
when
he
saw
her
eyes
wander
toward
the
notes
he
had
taken
weakly
rising
he
gathered
up
the
scribbled
papers
and
sealed
them
all
in
a
great
envelope
which
he
immediately
placed
in
his
inside
coat
pocket
he
had
sufficient
strength
to
get
home
but
was
so
clearly
in
need
of
medical
aid
that
dr
hartwell
was
summoned
at
once
as
the
doctor
put
him
to
bed
he
could
only
mutter
over
and
over
again
but
what
in
god's
name
can
we
do
dr
armitage
slept
but
was
partly
delirious
the
next
day
he
made
no
explanations
to
hartwell
but
in
his
calmer
moments
spoke
of
the
imperative
need
of
a
long
conference
with
rice
and
morgan
his
wilder
wanderings
were
very
startling
indeed
including
frantic
appeals
that
something
in
a
boarded-up
farmhouse
be
destroyed
and
fantastic
references
to
some
plan
for
the
extirpation
of
the
entire
human
race
and
all
animal
and
vegetable
life
from
the
earth
by
some
terrible
elder
race
of
beings
from
another
dimension
he
would
shout
that
the
world
was
in
danger
since
the
elder
things
wished
to
strip
it
and
drag
it
away
from
the
solar
system
and
cosmos
of
matter
into
some
other
plane
or
phase
of
entity
from
which
it
had
once
fallen
vigintillions
of
eons
ago
at
other
times
he
would
call
for
the
dreaded
necronomicon
and
the
dã¦monolatreia
of
remigius
in
which
he
seemed
hopeful
of
finding
some
formula
to
check
the
peril
he
conjured
up
stop
them
stop
them
he
would
shout
those
whateleys
meant
to
let
them
in
and
the
worst
of
all
is
left
tell
rice
and
morgan
we
must
do
something--it's
a
blind
business
but
i
know
how
to
make
the
powder
it
hasn't
been
fed
since
the
second
of
august
when
wilbur
came
here
to
his
death
and
at
that
rate
but
armitage
had
a
sound
physique
despite
his
seventy-three
years
and
slept
off
his
disorder
that
night
without
developing
any
real
fever
he
woke
late
friday
clear
of
head
though
sober
with
a
gnawing
fear
and
tremendous
sense
of
responsibility
saturday
afternoon
he
felt
able
to
go
over
to
the
library
and
summon
rice
and
morgan
for
a
conference
and
the
rest
of
that
day
and
evening
the
three
men
tortured
their
brains
in
the
wildest
speculation
and
the
most
desperate
debate
strange
and
terrible
books
were
drawn
voluminously
from
the
stack
shelves
and
from
secure
places
of
storage
and
diagrams
and
formulã¦
were
copied
with
feverish
haste
and
in
bewildering
abundance
of
skepticism
there
was
none
all
three
had
seen
the
body
of
wilbur
whateley
as
it
lay
on
the
floor
in
a
room
of
that
very
building
and
after
that
not
one
of
them
could
feel
even
slightly
inclined
to
treat
the
diary
as
a
madman's
raving
opinions
were
divided
as
to
notifying
the
massachusetts
state
police
and
the
negative
finally
won
there
were
things
involved
which
simply
could
not
be
believed
by
those
who
had
not
seen
a
sample
as
indeed
was
made
clear
during
certain
subsequent
investigations
late
at
night
the
conference
disbanded
without
having
developed
a
definite
plan
but
all
day
sunday
armitage
was
busy
comparing
formulã¦
and
mixing
chemicals
obtained
from
the
college
laboratory
the
more
he
reflected
on
the
hellish
diary
the
more
he
was
inclined
to
doubt
the
efficacy
of
any
material
agent
in
stamping
out
the
entity
which
wilbur
whateley
had
left
behind
him--the
earth-threatening
entity
which
unknown
to
him
was
to
burst
forth
in
a
few
hours
and
become
the
memorable
dunwich
horror
monday
was
a
repetition
of
sunday
with
dr
armitage
for
the
task
in
hand
required
an
infinity
of
research
and
experiment
further
consultations
of
the
monstrous
diary
brought
about
various
changes
of
plan
and
he
knew
that
even
in
the
end
a
large
amount
of
uncertainty
must
remain
by
tuesday
he
had
a
definite
line
of
action
mapped
out
and
believed
he
would
try
a
trip
to
dunwich
within
a
week
then
on
wednesday
the
great
shock
came
tucked
obscurely
away
in
a
corner
of
the
arkham
advertiser
was
a
facetious
little
item
from
the
associated
press
telling
what
a
record-breaking
monster
the
bootleg
whisky
of
dunwich
had
raised
up
armitage
half
stunned
could
only
telephone
for
rice
and
morgan
far
into
the
night
they
discussed
and
the
next
day
was
a
whirlwind
of
preparation
on
the
part
of
them
all
armitage
knew
he
would
be
meddling
with
terrible
powers
yet
saw
that
there
was
no
other
way
to
annul
the
deeper
and
more
malign
meddling
which
others
had
done
before
him
9
friday
morning
armitage
rice
and
morgan
set
out
by
motor
for
dunwich
arriving
at
the
village
about
1
in
the
afternoon
the
day
was
pleasant
but
even
in
the
brightest
sunlight
a
kind
of
quiet
dread
and
portent
seemed
to
hover
about
the
strangely
domed
hills
and
the
deep
shadowy
ravines
of
the
stricken
region
now
and
then
on
some
mountain
top
a
gaunt
circle
of
stones
could
be
glimpsed
against
the
sky
from
the
air
of
hushed
fright
at
osborn's
store
they
knew
something
hideous
had
happened
and
soon
learned
of
the
annihilation
of
the
elmer
frye
house
and
family
throughout
that
afternoon
they
rode
around
dunwich
questioning
the
natives
concerning
all
that
had
occurred
and
seeing
for
themselves
with
rising
pangs
of
horror
the
drear
frye
ruins
with
their
lingering
traces
of
the
tarry
stickiness
the
blasphemous
tracks
in
the
frye
yard
the
wounded
seth
bishop
cattle
and
the
enormous
swaths
of
disturbed
vegetation
in
various
places
the
trail
up
and
down
sentinel
hill
seemed
to
armitage
of
almost
cataclysmic
significance
and
he
looked
long
at
the
sinister
altarlike
stone
on
the
summit
at
length
the
visitors
apprised
of
a
party
of
state
police
which
had
come
from
aylesbury
that
morning
in
response
to
the
first
telephone
reports
of
the
frye
tragedy
decided
to
seek
out
the
officers
and
compare
notes
as
far
as
practicable
this
however
they
found
more
easily
planned
than
performed
since
no
sign
of
the
party
could
be
found
in
any
direction
there
had
been
five
of
them
in
a
car
but
now
the
car
stood
empty
near
the
ruins
in
the
frye
yard
the
natives
all
of
whom
had
talked
with
the
policemen
seemed
at
first
as
perplexed
as
armitage
and
his
companions
then
old
sam
hutchins
thought
of
something
and
turned
pale
nudging
fred
farr
and
pointing
to
the
dank
deep
hollow
that
yawned
close
by
gawd
he
gasped
i
telled
'em
not
ter
go
daown
into
the
glen
an'
i
never
thought
nobody'd
dew
it
with
them
tracks
an'
that
smell
an'
the
whippoorwills
a-screechin'
daown
thar
in
the
dark
o'
noonday
a
cold
shudder
ran
through
natives
and
visitors
alike
and
every
ear
seemed
strained
in
a
kind
of
instinctive
unconscious
listening
armitage
now
that
he
had
actually
come
upon
the
horror
and
its
monstrous
work
trembled
with
the
responsibility
he
felt
to
be
his
night
would
soon
fall
and
it
was
then
that
the
mountainous
blasphemy
lumbered
upon
its
eldritch
course
negotium
perambulans
in
tenebris
the
old
librarian
rehearsed
the
formulã¦
he
had
memorized
and
clutched
the
paper
containing
the
alternative
ones
he
had
not
memorized
he
saw
that
his
electric
flashlight
was
in
working
order
rice
beside
him
took
from
a
valise
a
metal
sprayer
of
the
sort
used
in
combating
insects
whilst
morgan
uncased
the
big-game
rifle
on
which
he
relied
despite
his
colleague's
warnings
that
no
material
weapon
would
be
of
help
armitage
having
read
the
hideous
diary
knew
painfully
well
what
kind
of
a
manifestation
to
expect
but
he
did
not
add
to
the
fright
of
the
dunwich
people
by
giving
any
hints
or
clues
he
hoped
that
it
might
be
conquered
without
any
revelation
to
the
world
of
the
monstrous
thing
it
had
escaped
as
the
shadows
gathered
the
natives
commenced
to
disperse
homeward
anxious
to
bar
themselves
indoors
despite
the
present
evidence
that
all
human
locks
and
bolts
were
useless
before
a
force
that
could
bend
trees
and
crush
houses
when
it
chose
they
shook
their
heads
at
the
visitors'
plan
to
stand
guard
at
the
frye
ruins
near
the
glen
and
as
they
left
had
little
expectancy
of
ever
seeing
the
watchers
again
there
were
rumblings
under
the
hills
that
night
and
the
whippoorwills
piped
threateningly
once
in
a
while
a
wind
sweeping
up
out
of
cold
spring
glen
would
bring
a
touch
of
ineffable
fetor
to
the
heavy
night
air
such
a
fetor
as
all
three
of
the
watchers
had
smelled
once
before
when
they
stood
above
a
dying
thing
that
had
passed
for
fifteen
years
and
a
half
as
a
human
being
but
the
looked-for
terror
did
not
appear
whatever
was
down
there
in
the
glen
was
biding
its
time
and
armitage
told
his
colleagues
it
would
be
suicidal
to
try
to
attack
it
in
the
dark
morning
came
wanly
and
the
night-sounds
ceased
it
was
a
gray
bleak
day
with
now
and
then
a
drizzle
of
rain
and
heavier
and
heavier
clouds
seemed
to
be
piling
themselves
up
beyond
the
hills
to
the
northwest
the
men
from
arkham
were
undecided
what
to
do
seeking
shelter
from
the
increasing
rainfall
beneath
one
of
the
few
undestroyed
frye
outbuildings
they
debated
the
wisdom
of
waiting
or
of
taking
the
aggressive
and
going
down
into
the
glen
in
quest
of
their
nameless
monstrous
quarry
the
downpour
waxed
in
heaviness
and
distant
peals
of
thunder
sounded
from
far
horizons
sheet
lightning
shimmered
and
then
a
forky
bolt
flashed
near
at
hand
as
if
descending
into
the
accursed
glen
itself
the
sky
grew
very
dark
and
the
watchers
hoped
that
the
storm
would
prove
a
short
sharp
one
followed
by
clear
weather
it
was
still
gruesomely
dark
when
not
much
over
an
hour
later
a
confused
babel
of
voices
sounded
down
the
road
another
moment
brought
to
view
a
frightened
group
of
more
than
a
dozen
men
running
shouting
and
even
whimpering
hysterically
someone
in
the
lead
began
sobbing
out
words
and
the
arkham
men
started
violently
when
those
words
developed
a
coherent
form
oh
my
gawd
my
gawd
the
voice
choked
out
it's
a-goin'
agin
an'
this
time
by
day
it's
aout--it's
aout
an'
a-movin'
this
very
minute
an'
only
the
lord
knows
when
it'll
be
on
us
all
the
speaker
panted
into
silence
but
another
took
up
his
message
nigh
on
a
haour
ago
zeb
whateley
here
heerd
the
'phone
a-ringin'
an'
it
was
mis'
corey
george's
wife
that
lives
daown
by
the
junction
she
says
the
hired
boy
luther
was
aout
drivin'
in
the
caows
from
the
storm
arter
the
big
bolt
when
he
see
all
the
trees
a-bendin'
at
the
maouth
o'
the
glen--opposite
side
ter
this--an'
smelt
the
same
awful
smell
like
he
smelt
when
he
faound
the
big
tracks
las'
monday
mornin'
an'
she
says
he
says
they
was
a
swishin'
lappin'
saound
more
nor
what
the
bendin'
trees
an'
bushes
could
make
an'
all
on
a
suddent
the
trees
along
the
rud
begun
ter
git
pushed
one
side
an'
they
was
a
awful
stompin'
an'
splashin'
in
the
mud
but
mind
ye
luther
he
didn't
see
nothin'
at
all
only
jest
the
bendin'
trees
an'
underbrush
then
fur
ahead
where
bishop's
brook
goes
under
the
rud
he
heerd
a
awful
creakin'
an'
strainin'
on
the
bridge
an'
says
he
could
tell
the
saound
o'
wood
a-startin'
to
crack
an'
split
an'
all
the
whiles
he
never
see
a
thing
only
them
trees
an'
bushes
a-bendin'
an'
when
the
swishin'
saound
got
very
fur
off--on
the
rud
towards
wizard
whateley's
an'
sentinel
hill--luther
he
had
the
guts
ter
step
up
whar
he'd
heerd
it
fust
an'
look
at
the
graound
it
was
all
mud
an'
water
an'
the
sky
was
dark
an'
the
rain
was
wipin'
aout
all
tracks
abaout
as
fast
as
could
be
but
beginnin'
at
the
glen
maouth
whar
the
trees
bed
moved
they
was
still
some
o'
them
awful
prints
big
as
bar'ls
like
he
seen
monday
at
this
point
the
first
excited
speaker
interrupted
but
that
ain't
the
trouble
naow--that
was
only
the
start
zeb
here
was
callin'
folks
up
an'
everybody
was
a-listenin'
in
when
a
call
from
seth
bishop's
cut
in
his
haousekeeper
sally
was
carryin'
on
fit
ter
kill--she'd
jest
seed
the
trees
a-bendin'
beside
the
rud
an'
says
they
was
a
kind
o'
mushy
saound
like
a
elephant
puffin'
an'
treadin'
a-headin'
fer
the
haouse
then
she
up
an'
spoke
suddent
of
a
fearful
smell
an'
says
her
boy
cha'ncey
was
a-screamin'
as
haow
it
was
jest
like
what
he
smelt
up
to
the
whateley
rewins
monday
mornin'
an'
the
dogs
was
all
barkin'
an'
whinin'
awful
an'
then
she
let
aout
a
turrible
yell
an'
says
the
shed
daown
the
rud
hed
jest
caved
in
like
the
storm
hed
blowed
it
over
only
the
wind
wa'n't
strong
enough
to
dew
that
everybody
was
a-listenin'
an'
ye
could
hear
lots
o'
folks
on
the
wire
a-gaspin'
all
to
onct
sally
she
yelled
agin
an'
says
the
front
yard
picket
fence
bed
jest
crumpled
up
though
they
wa'n't
no
sign
o'
what
done
it
then
everybody
on
the
line
could
hear
cha'ncey
an'
ol'
seth
bishop
a-yellin'
tew
an'
sally
was
shriekin'
aout
that
suthin'
heavy
hed
struck
the
haouse--not
lightnin'
nor
nothin'
but
suthin'
heavy
agin'
the
front
that
kep'
a-launchin'
itself
agin
an'
agin
though
ye
couldn't
see
nuthin'
aout
the
front
winders
an'
then

an'
then
lines
of
fright
deepened
on
every
face
and
armitage
shaken
as
he
was
had
barely
poise
enough
to
prompt
the
speaker
an'
then

sally
she
yelled
aout
'o
help
the
haouse
is
a-cavin'
in'

an'
on
the
wire
we
could
hoar
a
turrible
crashin'
an'
a
hull
flock
o'
screamin'

jest
like
when
elmer
frye's
place
was
took
only
wuss
the
man
paused
and
another
of
the
crowd
spoke
that's
all--not
a
saound
nor
squeak
over
the
'phone
arter
that
jest
still-like
we
that
heerd
it
got
aout
fords
an'
wagons
an'
raounded
up
as
many
able-bodied
men-folks
as
we
could
get
at
corey's
place
an'
come
up
here
ter
see
what
yew
thought
best
ter
dew
not
but
what
i
think
it's
the
lord's
judgment
fer
our
iniquities
that
no
mortal
kin
ever
set
aside
armitage
saw
that
the
time
for
positive
action
had
come
and
spoke
decisively
to
the
faltering
group
of
frightened
rustics
we
must
follow
it
boys
he
made
his
voice
as
reassuring
as
possible
i
believe
there's
a
chance
of
putting
it
out
of
business
you
men
know
that
those
whateleys
were
wizards--well
this
thing
is
a
thing
of
wizardry
and
must
be
put
down
by
the
same
means
i've
seen
wilbur
whateley's
diary
and
read
some
of
the
strange
old
books
he
used
to
read
and
i
think
i
know
the
right
kind
of
a
spell
to
recite
to
make
the
thing
fade
away
of
course
one
can't
be
sure
but
we
can
always
take
a
chance
it's
invisible--i
knew
it
would
be--but
there's
a
powder
in
this
long-distance
sprayer
that
might
make
it
show
up
for
a
second
later
on
we'll
try
it
it's
a
frightful
thing
to
have
alive
but
it
isn't
as
bad
as
what
wilbur
would
have
let
in
if
he'd
lived
longer
you'll
never
know
what
the
world
has
escaped
now
we've
only
this
one
thing
to
fight
and
it
can't
multiply
it
can
though
do
a
lot
of
harm
so
we
mustn't
hesitate
to
rid
the
community
of
it
we
must
follow
it--and
the
way
to
begin
is
to
go
to
the
place
that
has
just
been
wrecked
let
somebody
lead
the
way--i
don't
know
your
roads
very
well
but
i've
an
idea
there
might
be
a
shorter
cut
across
lots
how
about
it
the
men
shuffled
about
a
moment
and
then
earl
sawyer
spoke
softly
pointing
with
a
grimy
finger
through
the
steadily
lessening
rain
i
guess
ye
kin
git
to
seth
bishop's
quickest
by
cuttin'
acrost
the
lower
medder
here
wadin'
the
brook
at
the
low
place
an'
climbin'
through
carrier's
mowin'
an'
the
timber-lot
beyont
that
comes
aout
on
the
upper
rud
mighty
nigh
seth's--a
leetle
t'other
side
armitage
with
rice
and
morgan
started
to
walk
in
the
direction
indicated
and
most
of
the
natives
followed
slowly
the
sky
was
growing
lighter
and
there
were
signs
that
the
storm
had
worn
itself
away
when
armitage
inadvertently
took
a
wrong
direction
joe
osborn
warned
him
and
walked
ahead
to
show
the
right
one
courage
and
confidence
were
mounting
though
the
twilight
of
the
almost
perpendicular
wooded
hill
which
lay
toward
the
end
of
their
short
cut
and
among
whose
fantastic
ancient
trees
they
had
to
scramble
as
if
up
a
ladder
put
these
qualities
to
a
severe
test
at
length
they
emerged
on
a
muddy
road
to
find
the
sun
coming
out
they
were
a
little
beyond
the
seth
bishop
place
but
bent
trees
and
hideously
unmistakable
tracks
showed
what
had
passed
by
only
a
few
moments
were
consumed
in
surveying
the
ruins
just
around
the
bend
it
was
the
frye
incident
all
over
again
and
nothing
dead
or
living
was
found
in
either
of
the
collapsed
shells
which
had
been
the
bishop
house
and
barn
no
one
cared
to
remain
there
amidst
the
stench
and
the
tarry
stickiness
but
all
turned
instinctively
to
the
line
of
horrible
prints
leading
on
toward
the
wrecked
whateley
farmhouse
and
the
altar-crowned
slopes
of
sentinel
hill
as
the
men
passed
the
site
of
wilbur
whateley's
abode
they
shuddered
visibly
and
seemed
again
to
mix
hesitancy
with
their
zeal
it
was
no
joke
tracking
down
something
as
big
as
a
house
that
one
could
not
see
but
that
had
all
the
vicious
malevolence
of
a
demon
opposite
the
base
of
sentinel
hill
the
tracks
left
the
road
and
there
was
a
fresh
bending
and
matting
visible
along
the
broad
swath
marking
the
monster's
former
route
to
and
from
the
summit
armitage
produced
a
pocket
telescope
of
considerable
power
and
scanned
the
steep
green
side
of
the
hill
then
he
handed
the
instrument
to
morgan
whose
sight
was
keener
after
a
moment
of
gazing
morgan
cried
out
sharply
passing
the
glass
to
earl
sawyer
and
indicating
a
certain
spot
on
the
slope
with
his
finger
sawyer
as
clumsy
as
most
non-users
of
optical
devices
are
fumbled
a
while
but
eventually
focused
the
lenses
with
armitage's
aid
when
he
did
so
his
cry
was
less
restrained
than
morgan's
had
been
gawd
almighty
the
grass
an'
bushes
is
a-movin'
it's
a-goin'
up--slow-like--creepin'
up
ter
the
top
this
minute
heaven
only
knows
what
fer
then
the
germ
of
panic
seemed
to
spread
among
the
seekers
it
was
one
thing
to
chase
the
nameless
entity
but
quite
another
to
find
it
spells
might
be
all
right--but
suppose
they
weren't
voices
began
questioning
armitage
about
what
he
knew
of
the
thing
and
no
reply
seemed
quite
to
satisfy
everyone
seemed
to
feel
himself
in
close
proximity
to
phases
of
nature
and
of
being
utterly
forbidden
and
wholly
outside
the
sane
experience
of
mankind
10
in
the
end
the
three
men
from
arkham--old
white-bearded
dr
armitage
stocky
iron-gray
professor
rice
and
lean
youngish
dr
morgan--ascended
the
mountain
alone
after
much
patient
instruction
regarding
its
focusing
and
use
they
left
the
telescope
with
the
frightened
group
that
remained
in
the
road
and
as
they
climbed
they
were
watched
closely
by
those
among
whom
the
glass
was
passed
around
it
was
hard
going
and
armitage
had
to
be
helped
more
than
once
high
above
the
toiling
group
the
great
swath
trembled
as
its
hellish
maker
repassed
with
snail-like
deliberateness
then
it
was
obvious
that
the
pursuers
were
gaining
curtis
whateley--of
the
undecayed
branch--was
holding
the
telescope
when
the
arkham
party
detoured
radically
from
the
swath
he
told
the
crowd
that
the
men
were
evidently
trying
to
get
to
a
subordinate
peak
which
overlooked
the
swath
at
a
point
considerably
ahead
of
where
the
shrubbery
was
now
bending
this
indeed
proved
to
be
true
and
the
party
were
seen
to
gain
the
minor
elevation
only
a
short
time
after
the
invisible
blasphemy
had
passed
it
then
wesley
corey
who
had
taken
the
glass
cried
out
that
armitage
was
adjusting
the
sprayer
which
rice
held
and
that
something
must
be
about
to
happen
the
crowd
stirred
uneasily
recalling
that
this
sprayer
was
expected
to
give
the
unseen
horror
a
moment
of
visibility
two
or
three
men
shut
their
eyes
but
curtis
whateley
snatched
back
the
telescope
and
strained
his
vision
to
the
utmost
he
saw
that
rice
from
the
party's
point
of
vantage
above
and
behind
the
entity
had
an
excellent
chance
of
spreading
the
potent
powder
with
marvelous
effect
those
without
the
telescope
saw
only
an
instant's
flash

the
size
of

large

the
top
of
the
mountain
curtis
who
had
held
the
instrument
dropped
it
with
a
piercing
shriek
into
the
ankle-deep
mud
of
the
road
he
reeled
and
would
have
crumpled
to
the
ground
had
not
two
or
three
others
seized
and
steadied
him
all
he
could
do
was
moan
half-inaudibly
oh
oh
great
gawd

that

that
illustration
oh
oh
great
gawd

that

that
there
was
a
pandemonium
of
questioning
and
only
henry
wheeler
thought
to
rescue
the
fallen
telescope
and
wipe
it
clean
of
mud
curtis
was
past
all
coherence
and
even
isolated
replies
were
almost
too
much
for
him

on

this
final
memory
whatever
it
was
proved
too
much
for
poor
curtis
and
he
collapsed
completely
before
he
could
say
more
fred
farr
and
will
hutchins
carried
him
to
the
roadside
and
laid
him
on
the
damp
grass
henry
wheeler
trembling
turned
the
rescued
telescope
on
the
mountain
to
see
what
he
might
through
the
lenses
were
discernible
three
tiny
figures
apparently
running
toward
the
summit
as
fast
as
the
steep
incline
allowed
only
these--nothing
more
then
everyone
noticed
a
strangely
unseasonable
noise
in
the
deep
valley
behind
and
even
in
the
underbrush
of
sentinel
hill
itself
it
was
the
piping
of
unnumbered
whippoorwills
and
in
their
shrill
chorus
there
seemed
to
lurk
a
note
of
tense
and
evil
expectancy
earl
sawyer
now
took
the
telescope
and
reported
the
three
figures
as
standing
on
the
topmost
ridge
virtually
level
with
the
altar-stone
but
at
a
considerable
distance
from
it
one
figure
he
said
seemed
to
be
raising
its
hands
above
its
head
at
rhythmic
intervals
and
as
sawyer
mentioned
the
circumstance
the
crowd
seemed
to
hear
a
faint
half-musical
sound
from
the
distance
as
if
a
loud
chant
were
accompanying
the
gestures
the
weird
silhouette
on
that
remote
peak
must
have
been
a
spectacle
of
infinite
grotesqueness
and
impressiveness
but
no
observer
was
in
a
mood
for
esthetic
appreciation
i
guess
he's
sayin'
the
spell
whispered
wheeler
as
he
snatched
back
the
telescope
the
whippoorwills
were
piping
wildly
and
in
a
singularly
curious
irregular
rhythm
quite
unlike
that
of
the
visible
ritual
suddenly
the
sunshine
seemed
to
lessen
without
the
intervention
of
any
discernible
cloud
it
was
a
very
peculiar
phenomenon
and
was
plainly
marked
by
all
a
rumbling
sound
seemed
brewing
beneath
the
hills
mixed
strangely
with
a
concordant
rumbling
which
clearly
came
from
the
sky
lightning
flashed
aloft
and
the
wondering
crowd
looked
in
vain
for
the
portents
of
storm
the
chanting
of
the
men
from
arkham
now
became
unmistakable
and
wheeler
saw
through
the
glass
that
they
were
all
raising
their
arms
in
the
rhythmic
incantation
from
some
farmhouse
far
away
came
the
frantic
barking
of
dogs
the
change
in
the
quality
of
the
daylight
increased
and
the
crowd
gazed
about
the
horizon
in
wonder
a
purplish
darkness
born
of
nothing
more
than
a
spectral
deepening
of
the
sky's
blue
pressed
down
upon
the
rumbling
hills
then
the
lightning
flashed
again
somewhat
brighter
than
before
and
the
crowd
fancied
that
it
had
showed
a
certain
mistiness
around
the
altar-stone
on
the
distant
height
no
one
however
had
been
using
the
telescope
at
that
instant
the
whippoorwills
continued
their
irregular
pulsation
and
the
men
of
dunwich
braced
themselves
tensely
against
some
imponderable
menace
with
which
the
atmosphere
seemed
surcharged
without
warning
came
those
deep
cracked
raucous
vocal
sounds
which
will
never
leave
the
memory
of
the
stricken
group
who
heard
them
not
from
any
human
throat
were
they
born
for
the
organs
of
man
can
yield
no
such
acoustic
perversions
rather
would
one
have
said
they
came
from
the
pit
itself
had
not
their
source
been
so
unmistakably
the
altar-stone
on
the
peak
it
is
almost
erroneous
to
call
them
sounds
at
all
since
so
much
of
their
ghastly
infra-bass
timbre
spoke
to
dim
seats
of
consciousness
and
terror
far
subtler
than
the
ear
yet
one
must
do
so
since
their
form
was
indisputably
though
vaguely
that
of
half-articulate
words
they
were
loud--loud
as
the
rumblings
and
the
thunder
above
which
they
echoed--yet
did
they
come
from
no
visible
being
and
because
imagination
might
suggest
a
conjectural
source
in
the
world
of
non-visible
beings
the
huddled
crowd
at
the
mountain's
base
huddled
still
closer
and
winced
as
if
in
expectation
of
a
blow

the
speaking
impulse
seemed
to
falter
here
as
if
some
frightful
psychic
struggle
were
going
on
henry
wheeler
strained
his
eye
at
the
telescope
but
saw
only
the
three
grotesquely
silhouetted
human
figures
on
the
peak
all
moving
their
arms
furiously
in
strange
gestures
as
their
incantation
drew
near
its
culmination
from
what
black
wells
of
acherontic
fear
or
feeling
from
what
unplumbed
gulfs
of
extra-cosmic
consciousness
or
obscure
long-latent
heredity
were
those
half-articulate
thunder-croakings
drawn
presently
they
began
to
gather
renewed
force
and
coherence
as
they
grew
in
stark
utter
ultimate
frenzy

but
that
was
all
the
pallid
group
in
the
road
still
reeling
at
the
indisputably
english
syllables
that
had
poured
thickly
and
thunderously
down
from
the
frantic
vacancy
beside
that
shocking
altar-stone
were
never
to
hear
such
syllables
again
instead
they
jumped
violently
at
the
terrific
report
which
seemed
to
rend
the
hills
the
deafening
cataclysmic
peal
whose
source
be
it
inner
earth
or
sky
no
hearer
was
ever
able
to
place
a
single
lightning
bolt
shot
from
the
purple
zenith
to
the
altar-stone
and
a
great
tidal
wave
of
viewless
force
and
indescribable
stench
swept
down
from
the
hill
to
all
the
countryside
trees
grass
and
underbrush
were
whipped
into
a
fury
and
the
frightened
crowd
at
the
mountain's
base
weakened
by
the
lethal
fetor
that
seemed
about
to
asphyxiate
them
were
almost
hurled
off
their
feet
dogs
howled
from
the
distance
green
grass
and
foliage
wilted
to
a
curious
sickly
yellow-gray
and
over
field
and
forest
were
scattered
the
bodies
of
dead
whippoorwills
the
stench
left
quickly
but
the
vegetation
never
came
right
again
to
this
day
there
is
something
queer
and
unholy
about
the
growths
on
and
around
that
fearsome
hill
curtis
whateley
was
only
just
regaining
consciousness
when
the
arkham
men
came
slowly
down
the
mountain
in
the
beams
of
a
sunlight
once
more
brilliant
and
untainted
they
were
grave
and
quiet
and
seemed
shaken
by
memories
and
reflections
even
more
terrible
than
those
which
had
reduced
the
group
of
natives
to
a
state
of
cowed
quivering
in
reply
to
a
jumble
of
questions
they
only
shook
their
heads
and
reaffirmed
one
vital
fact
the
thing
has
gone
for
ever
armitage
said
it
has
been
split
up
into
what
it
was
originally
made
of
and
can
never
exist
again
it
was
an
impossibility
in
a
normal
world
only
the
least
fraction
was
really
matter
in
any
sense
we
know
it
was
like
its
father--and
most
of
it
has
gone
back
to
him
in
some
vague
realm
or
dimension
outside
our
material
universe
some
vague
abyss
out
of
which
only
the
most
accursed
rites
of
human
blasphemy
could
ever
have
called
him
for
a
moment
on
the
hills
there
was
a
brief
silence
and
in
that
pause
the
scattered
senses
of
poor
curtis
whateley
began
to
knit
back
into
a
sort
of
continuity
so
that
he
put
his
hands
to
his
head
with
a
moan
memory
seemed
to
pick
itself
up
where
it
had
left
off
and
the
horror
of
the
sight
that
had
prostrated
him
burst
in
upon
him
again
oh
oh
my
gawd
that
haff
face

that
haff
face
on
top
of
it

that
face
with
the
red
eyes
an'
crinkly
albino
hair
an'
no
chin
like
the
whateleys
it
was
a
octopus
centipede
spider
kind
o'
thing
but
they
was
a
haff-shaped
man's
face
on
top
of
it
an'
it
looked
like
wizard
whateley's
only
it
was
yards
an'
yards
acrost
he
paused
exhausted
as
the
whole
group
of
natives
stared
in
a
bewilderment
not
quite
crystallized
into
fresh
terror
only
old
zebulon
whateley
who
wanderingly
remembered
ancient
things
but
who
had
been
silent
heretofore
spoke
aloud
fifteen
year'
gone
he
rambled
i
heerd
ol'
whateley
say
as
haow
some
day
we'd
hear
a
child
o'
lavinny's
a-callin'
its
father's
name
on
the
top
o'
sentinel
hill
but
joe
osborn
interrupted
him
to
question
the
arkham
men
anew
what
was
it
anyhaow
an'
haowever
did
young
wizard
whateley
call
it
aout
o'
the
air
it
come
from
armitage
chose
his
words
carefully
it
was--well
it
was
mostly
a
kind
of
force
that
doesn't
belong
in
our
part
of
space
a
kind
of
force
that
acts
and
grows
and
shapes
itself
by
other
laws
than
those
of
our
sort
of
nature
we
have
no
business
calling
in
such
things
from
outside
and
only
very
wicked
people
and
very
wicked
cults
ever
try
to
there
was
some
of
it
in
wilbur
whateley
himself--enough
to
make
a
devil
and
a
precocious
monster
of
him
and
to
make
his
passing
out
a
pretty
terrible
sight
i'm
going
to
burn
his
accursed
diary
and
if
you
men
are
wise
you'll
dynamite
that
altar-stone
up
there
and
pull
down
all
the
rings
of
standing
stones
on
the
other
hills
things
like
that
brought
down
the
beings
those
whateleys
were
so
fond
of--the
beings
they
were
going
to
let
in
tangibly
to
wipe
out
the
human
race
and
drag
the
earth
off
to
some
nameless
place
for
some
nameless
purpose
but
as
to
this
thing
we've
just
sent
back--the
whateleys
raised
it
for
a
terrible
part
in
the
doings
that
were
to
come
it
grew
fast
and
big
from
the
same
reason
that
wilbur
grew
fast
and
big--but
it
beat
him
because
it
had
a
greater
share
of
the
outsideness
in
it
you
needn't
ask
how
wilbur
called
it
out
of
the
air
he
didn't
call
it
out
it
was
his
twin
brother
but
it
looked
more
like
the
father
than
he
did
