i
breathe
freely
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
lake
the
ground
upon
which
i
tread
has
been
subdued
from
the
earliest
ages
the
principal
objects
which
immediately
strike
my
eye
bring
to
my
recollection
scenes
in
which
man
acted
the
hero
and
was
the
chief
object
of
interest
not
to
look
back
to
earlier
times
of
battles
and
sieges
here
is
the
bust
of
rousseau--here
is
a
house
with
an
inscription
denoting
that
the
genevan
philosopher
first
drew
breath
under
its
roof
a
little
out
of
the
town
is
ferney
the
residence
of
voltaire
where
that
wonderful
though
certainly
in
many
respects
contemptible
character
received
like
the
hermits
of
old
the
visits
of
pilgrims
not
only
from
his
own
nation
but
from
the
farthest
boundaries
of
europe
here
too
is
bonnet's
abode
and
a
few
steps
beyond
the
house
of
that
astonishing
woman
madame
de
stael
perhaps
the
first
of
her
sex
who
has
really
proved
its
often
claimed
equality
with
the
nobler
man
we
have
before
had
women
who
have
written
interesting
novels
and
poems
in
which
their
tact
at
observing
drawing-room
characters
has
availed
them
but
never
since
the
days
of
heloise
have
those
faculties
which
are
peculiar
to
man
been
developed
as
the
possible
inheritance
of
woman
though
even
here
as
in
the
case
of
heloise
our
sex
have
not
been
backward
in
alledging
the
existence
of
an
abeilard
in
the
person
of
m
schlegel
as
the
inspirer
of
her
works
but
to
proceed
upon
the
same
side
of
the
lake
gibbon
bonnivard
bradshaw
and
others
mark
as
it
were
the
stages
for
our
progress
whilst
upon
the
other
side
there
is
one
house
built
by
diodati
the
friend
of
milton
which
has
contained
within
its
walls
for
several
months
that
poet
whom
we
have
so
often
read
together
and
who--if
human
passions
remain
the
same
and
human
feelings
like
chords
on
being
swept
by
nature's
impulses
shall
vibrate
as
before--will
be
placed
by
posterity
in
the
first
rank
of
our
english
poets
you
must
have
heard
or
the
third
canto
of
childe
harold
will
have
informed
you
that
lord
byron
resided
many
months
in
this
neighbourhood
i
went
with
some
friends
a
few
days
ago
after
having
seen
ferney
to
view
this
mansion
i
trod
the
floors
with
the
same
feelings
of
awe
and
respect
as
we
did
together
those
of
shakespeare's
dwelling
at
stratford
i
sat
down
in
a
chair
of
the
saloon
and
satisfied
myself
that
i
was
resting
on
what
he
had
made
his
constant
seat
i
found
a
servant
there
who
had
lived
with
him
she
however
gave
me
but
little
information
she
pointed
out
his
bed-chamber
upon
the
same
level
as
the
saloon
and
dining-room
and
informed
me
that
he
retired
to
rest
at
three
got
up
at
two
and
employed
himself
a
long
time
over
his
toilette
that
he
never
went
to
sleep
without
a
pair
of
pistols
and
a
dagger
by
his
side
and
that
he
never
ate
animal
food
he
apparently
spent
some
part
of
every
day
upon
the
lake
in
an
english
boat
there
is
a
balcony
from
the
saloon
which
looks
upon
the
lake
and
the
mountain
jura
and
i
imagine
that
it
must
have
been
hence
he
contemplated
the
storm
so
magnificently
described
in
the
third
canto
for
you
have
from
here
a
most
extensive
view
of
all
the
points
he
has
therein
depicted
i
can
fancy
him
like
the
scathed
pine
whilst
all
around
was
sunk
to
repose
still
waking
to
observe
what
gave
but
a
weak
image
of
the
storms
which
had
desolated
his
own
breast
the
sky
is
changed--and
such
a
change
oh
night
and
storm
and
darkness
ye
are
wond'rous
strong
yet
lovely
in
your
strength
as
is
the
light
of
a
dark
eye
in
woman
far
along
from
peak
to
peak
the
rattling
crags
among
leaps
the
lire
thunder
not
from
one
lone
cloud
but
every
mountain
now
hath
found
a
tongue
and
jura
answers
thro'
her
misty
shroud
back
to
the
joyous
alps
who
call
to
her
aloud
and
this
is
in
the
night--most
glorious
night
thou
wer't
not
sent
for
slumber
let
me
be
a
sharer
in
thy
far
and
fierce
delight--
a
portion
of
the
tempest
and
of
me
how
the
lit
lake
shines
a
phosphoric
sea
and
the
big
rain
comet
dancing
to
the
earth
and
now
again
'tis
black--and
now
the
glee
of
the
loud
hills
shakes
with
its
mountain
mirth
as
if
they
did
rejoice
o'er
a
young
earthquake's
birth
now
where
the
swift
rhine
cleaves
his
way
between
heights
which
appear
as
lovers
who
have
parted
in
haste
whose
mining
depths
so
intervene
that
they
can
meet
no
more
tho'
broken
hearted
tho'
in
their
souls
which
thus
each
other
thwarted
love
was
the
very
root
of
the
fond
rage
which
blighted
their
life's
bloom
and
then
departed--
itself
expired
but
leaving
them
an
age
of
years
all
winter--war
within
themselves
to
wage
i
went
down
to
the
little
port
if
i
may
use
the
expression
wherein
his
vessel
used
to
lay
and
conversed
with
the
cottager
who
had
the
care
of
it
you
may
smile
but
i
have
my
pleasure
in
thus
helping
my
personification
of
the
individual
i
admire
by
attaining
to
the
knowledge
of
those
circumstances
which
were
daily
around
him
i
have
made
numerous
enquiries
in
the
town
concerning
him
but
can
learn
nothing
he
only
went
into
society
there
once
when
m
pictet
took
him
to
the
house
of
a
lady
to
spend
the
evening
they
say
he
is
a
very
singular
man
and
seem
to
think
him
very
uncivil
amongst
other
things
they
relate
that
having
invited
m
pictet
and
bonstetten
to
dinner
he
went
on
the
lake
to
chillon
leaving
a
gentleman
who
travelled
with
him
to
receive
them
and
make
his
apologies
another
evening
being
invited
to
the
house
of
lady
d----
h----
he
promised
to
attend
but
upon
approaching
the
windows
of
her
ladyship's
villa
and
perceiving
the
room
to
be
full
of
company
he
set
down
his
friend
desiring
him
to
plead
his
excuse
and
immediately
returned
home
this
will
serve
as
a
contradiction
to
the
report
which
you
tell
me
is
current
in
england
of
his
having
been
avoided
by
his
countrymen
on
the
continent
the
case
happens
to
be
directly
the
reverse
as
he
has
been
generally
sought
by
them
though
on
most
occasions
apparently
without
success
it
is
said
indeed
that
upon
paying
his
first
visit
at
coppet
following
the
servant
who
had
announced
his
name
he
was
surprised
to
meet
a
lady
carried
out
fainting
but
before
he
had
been
seated
many
minutes
the
same
lady
who
had
been
so
affected
at
the
sound
of
his
name
returned
and
conversed
with
him
a
considerable
time--such
is
female
curiosity
and
affectation
he
visited
coppet
frequently
and
of
course
associated
there
with
several
of
his
countrymen
who
evinced
no
reluctance
to
meet
him
whom
his
enemies
alone
would
represent
as
an
outcast
though
i
have
been
so
unsuccessful
in
this
town
i
have
been
more
fortunate
in
my
enquiries
elsewhere
there
is
a
society
three
or
four
miles
from
geneva
the
centre
of
which
is
the
countess
of
breuss
a
russian
lady
well
acquainted
with
the
agrã©mens
de
la
sociã©tã©
and
who
has
collected
them
round
herself
at
her
mansion
it
was
chiefly
here
i
find
that
the
gentleman
who
travelled
with
lord
byron
as
physician
sought
for
society
he
used
almost
every
day
to
cross
the
lake
by
himself
in
one
of
their
flat-bottomed
boats
and
return
after
passing
the
evening
with
his
friends
about
eleven
or
twelve
at
night
often
whilst
the
storms
were
raging
in
the
circling
summits
of
the
mountains
around
as
he
became
intimate
from
long
acquaintance
with
several
of
the
families
in
this
neighbourhood
i
have
gathered
from
their
accounts
some
excellent
traits
of
his
lordship's
character
which
i
will
relate
to
you
at
some
future
opportunity
i
must
however
free
him
from
one
imputation
attached
to
him--of
having
in
his
house
two
sisters
as
the
partakers
of
his
revels
this
is
like
many
other
charges
which
have
been
brought
against
his
lordship
entirely
destitute
of
truth
his
only
companion
was
the
physician
i
have
already
mentioned
the
report
originated
from
the
following
circumstance
mr
percy
bysshe
shelly
a
gentleman
well
known
for
extravagance
of
doctrine
and
for
his
daring
in
their
profession
even
to
sign
himself
with
the
title
of
atheos
in
the
album
at
chamouny
having
taken
a
house
below
in
which
he
resided
with
miss
m
w
godwin
and
miss
clermont
the
daughters
of
the
celebrated
mr
godwin
they
were
frequently
visitors
at
diodati
and
were
often
seen
upon
the
lake
with
his
lordship
which
gave
rise
to
the
report
the
truth
of
which
is
here
positively
denied
among
other
things
which
the
lady
from
whom
i
procured
these
anecdotes
related
to
me
she
mentioned
the
outline
of
a
ghost
story
by
lord
byron
it
appears
that
one
evening
lord
b
mr
p
b
shelly
the
two
ladies
and
the
gentleman
before
alluded
to
after
having
perused
a
german
work
which
was
entitled
phantasmagoriana
began
relating
ghost
stories
when
his
lordship
having
recited
the
beginning
of
christabel
then
unpublished
the
whole
took
so
strong
a
hold
of
mr
shelly's
mind
that
he
suddenly
started
up
and
ran
out
of
the
room
the
physician
and
lord
byron
followed
and
discovered
him
leaning
against
a
mantle-piece
with
cold
drops
of
perspiration
trickling
down
his
face
after
having
given
him
something
to
refresh
him
upon
enquiring
into
the
cause
of
his
alarm
they
found
that
his
wild
imagination
having
pictured
to
him
the
bosom
of
one
of
the
ladies
with
eyes
which
was
reported
of
a
lady
in
the
neighbourhood
where
he
lived
he
was
obliged
to
leave
the
room
in
order
to
destroy
the
impression
it
was
afterwards
proposed
in
the
course
of
conversation
that
each
of
the
company
present
should
write
a
tale
depending
upon
some
supernatural
agency
which
was
undertaken
by
lord
b
the
physician
and
miss
m
w
godwin1
my
friend
the
lady
above
referred
to
had
in
her
possession
the
outline
of
each
of
these
stories
i
obtained
them
as
a
great
favour
and
herewith
forward
them
to
you
as
i
was
assured
you
would
feel
as
much
curiosity
as
myself
to
peruse
the
ebauches
of
so
great
a
genius
and
those
immediately
under
his
influence

since
published
under
the
title
of
frankenstein
or
the
modern
prometheus
the
vampyre

introduction

the
superstition
upon
which
this
tale
is
founded
is
very
general
in
the
east
among
the
arabians
it
appears
to
be
common
it
did
not
however
extend
itself
to
the
greeks
until
after
the
establishment
of
christianity
and
it
has
only
assumed
its
present
form
since
the
division
of
the
latin
and
greek
churches
at
which
time
the
idea
becoming
prevalent
that
a
latin
body
could
not
corrupt
if
buried
in
their
territory
it
gradually
increased
and
formed
the
subject
of
many
wonderful
stories
still
extant
of
the
dead
rising
from
their
graves
and
feeding
upon
the
blood
of
the
young
and
beautiful
in
the
west
it
spread
with
some
slight
variation
all
over
hungary
poland
austria
and
lorraine
where
the
belief
existed
that
vampyres
nightly
imbibed
a
certain
portion
of
the
blood
of
their
victims
who
became
emaciated
lost
their
strength
and
speedily
died
of
consumptions
whilst
these
human
blood-suckers
fattened--and
their
veins
became
distended
to
such
a
state
of
repletion
as
to
cause
the
blood
to
flow
from
all
the
passages
of
their
bodies
and
even
from
the
very
pores
of
their
skins
in
the
london
journal
of
march
1732
is
a
curious
and
of
course
credible
account
of
a
particular
case
of
vampyrism
which
is
stated
to
have
occurred
at
madreyga
in
hungary
it
appears
that
upon
an
examination
of
the
commander-in-chief
and
magistrates
of
the
place
they
positively
and
unanimously
affirmed
that
about
five
years
before
a
certain
heyduke
named
arnold
paul
had
been
heard
to
say
that
at
cassovia
on
the
frontiers
of
the
turkish
servia
he
had
been
tormented
by
a
vampyre
but
had
found
a
way
to
rid
himself
of
the
evil
by
eating
some
of
the
earth
out
of
the
vampyre's
grave
and
rubbing
himself
with
his
blood
this
precaution
however
did
not
prevent
him
from
becoming
a
vampyre2
himself
for
about
twenty
or
thirty
days
after
his
death
and
burial
many
persons
complained
of
having
been
tormented
by
him
and
a
deposition
was
made
that
four
persons
had
been
deprived
of
life
by
his
attacks
to
prevent
further
mischief
the
inhabitants
having
consulted
their
hadagni3
took
up
the
body
and
found
it
as
is
supposed
to
be
usual
in
cases
of
vampyrism
fresh
and
entirely
free
from
corruption
and
emitting
at
the
mouth
nose
and
ears
pure
and
florid
blood
proof
having
been
thus
obtained
they
resorted
to
the
accustomed
remedy
a
stake
was
driven
entirely
through
the
heart
and
body
of
arnold
paul
at
which
he
is
reported
to
have
cried
out
as
dreadfully
as
if
he
had
been
alive
this
done
they
cut
off
his
head
burned
his
body
and
threw
the
ashes
into
his
grave
the
same
measures
were
adopted
with
the
corses
of
those
persons
who
had
previously
died
from
vampyrism
lest
they
should
in
their
turn
become
agents
upon
others
who
survived
them
2
the
universal
belief
is
that
a
person
sucked
by
a
vampyre
becomes
a
vampyre
himself
and
sucks
in
his
turn

chief
bailiff
this
monstrous
rodomontade
is
here
related
because
it
seems
better
adapted
to
illustrate
the
subject
of
the
present
observations
than
any
other
instance
which
could
be
adduced
in
many
parts
of
greece
it
is
considered
as
a
sort
of
punishment
after
death
for
some
heinous
crime
committed
whilst
in
existence
that
the
deceased
is
not
only
doomed
to
vampyrise
but
compelled
to
confine
his
infernal
visitations
solely
to
those
beings
he
loved
most
while
upon
earth--those
to
whom
he
was
bound
by
ties
of
kindred
and
affection--a
supposition
alluded
to
in
the
giaour
but
first
on
earth
as
vampyre
sent
thy
corse
shall
from
its
tomb
be
rent
then
ghastly
haunt
the
native
place
and
suck
the
blood
of
all
thy
race
there
from
thy
daughter
sister
wife
at
midnight
drain
the
stream
of
life
yet
loathe
the
banquet
which
perforce
must
feed
thy
livid
living
corse
thy
victims
ere
they
yet
expire
shall
know
the
demon
for
their
sire
as
cursing
thee
thou
cursing
them
thy
flowers
are
withered
on
the
stem
but
one
that
for
thy
crime
must
fall
the
youngest
best
beloved
of
all
shall
bless
thee
with
a
father's
name--
that
word
shall
wrap
thy
heart
in
flame
yet
thou
must
end
thy
task
and
mark
her
cheek's
last
tinge--her
eye's
last
spark
and
the
last
glassy
glance
must
view
which
freezes
o'er
its
lifeless
blue
then
with
unhallowed
hand
shall
tear
the
tresses
of
her
yellow
hair
of
which
in
life
a
lock
when
shorn
affection's
fondest
pledge
was
worn--
but
now
is
borne
away
by
thee
memorial
of
thine
agony
yet
with
thine
own
best
blood
shall
drip
thy
gnashing
tooth
and
haggard
lip
then
stalking
to
thy
sullen
grave
go--and
with
gouls
and
afrits
rave
till
these
in
horror
shrink
away
from
spectre
more
accursed
than

mr
southey
has
also
introduced
in
his
wild
but
beautiful
poem
of
thalaba
the
vampyre
corse
of
the
arabian
maid
oneiza
who
is
represented
as
having
returned
from
the
grave
for
the
purpose
of
tormenting
him
she
best
loved
whilst
in
existence
but
this
cannot
be
supposed
to
have
resulted
from
the
sinfulness
of
her
life
she
being
pourtrayed
throughout
the
whole
of
the
tale
as
a
complete
type
of
purity
and
innocence
the
veracious
tournefort
gives
a
long
account
in
his
travels
of
several
astonishing
cases
of
vampyrism
to
which
he
pretends
to
have
been
an
eyewitness
and
calmet
in
his
great
work
upon
this
subject
besides
a
variety
of
anecdotes
and
traditionary
narratives
illustrative
of
its
effects
has
put
forth
some
learned
dissertations
tending
to
prove
it
to
be
a
classical
as
well
as
barbarian
error
many
curious
and
interesting
notices
on
this
singularly
horrible
superstition
might
be
added
though
the
present
may
suffice
for
the
limits
of
a
note
necessarily
devoted
to
explanation
and
which
may
now
be
concluded
by
merely
remarking
that
though
the
term
vampyre
is
the
one
in
most
general
acceptation
there
are
several
others
synonymous
with
it
made
use
of
in
various
parts
of
the
world
as

c

the
vampyre

it
happened
that
in
the
midst
of
the
dissipations
attendant
upon
a
london
winter
there
appeared
at
the
various
parties
of
the
leaders
of
the
ton
a
nobleman
more
remarkable
for
his
singularities
than
his
rank
he
gazed
upon
the
mirth
around
him
as
if
he
could
not
participate
therein
apparently
the
light
laughter
of
the
fair
only
attracted
his
attention
that
he
might
by
a
look
quell
it
and
throw
fear
into
those
breasts
where
thoughtlessness
reigned
those
who
felt
this
sensation
of
awe
could
not
explain
whence
it
arose
some
attributed
it
to
the
dead
grey
eye
which
fixing
upon
the
object's
face
did
not
seem
to
penetrate
and
at
one
glance
to
pierce
through
to
the
inward
workings
of
the
heart
but
fell
upon
the
cheek
with
a
leaden
ray
that
weighed
upon
the
skin
it
could
not
pass
his
peculiarities
caused
him
to
be
invited
to
every
house
all
wished
to
see
him
and
those
who
had
been
accustomed
to
violent
excitement
and
now
felt
the
weight
of
ennui
were
pleased
at
having
something
in
their
presence
capable
of
engaging
their
attention
in
spite
of
the
deadly
hue
of
his
face
which
never
gained
a
warmer
tint
either
from
the
blush
of
modesty
or
from
the
strong
emotion
of
passion
though
its
form
and
outline
were
beautiful
many
of
the
female
hunters
after
notoriety
attempted
to
win
his
attentions
and
gain
at
least
some
marks
of
what
they
might
term
affection
lady
mercer
who
had
been
the
mockery
of
every
monster
shewn
in
drawing-rooms
since
her
marriage
threw
herself
in
his
way
and
did
all
but
put
on
the
dress
of
a
mountebank
to
attract
his
notice--though
in
vain--when
she
stood
before
him
though
his
eyes
were
apparently
fixed
upon
her's
still
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
unperceived--even
her
unappalled
impudence
was
baffled
and
she
left
the
field
but
though
the
common
adultress
could
not
influence
even
the
guidance
of
his
eyes
it
was
not
that
the
female
sex
was
indifferent
to
him
yet
such
was
the
apparent
caution
with
which
he
spoke
to
the
virtuous
wife
and
innocent
daughter
that
few
knew
he
ever
addressed
himself
to
females
he
had
however
the
reputation
of
a
winning
tongue
and
whether
it
was
that
it
even
overcame
the
dread
of
his
singular
character
or
that
they
were
moved
by
his
apparent
hatred
of
vice
he
was
as
often
among
those
females
who
form
the
boast
of
their
sex
from
their
domestic
virtues
as
among
those
who
sully
it
by
their
vices
about
the
same
time
there
came
to
london
a
young
gentleman
of
the
name
of
aubrey
he
was
an
orphan
left
with
an
only
sister
in
the
possession
of
great
wealth
by
parents
who
died
while
he
was
yet
in
childhood
left
also
to
himself
by
guardians
who
thought
it
their
duty
merely
to
take
care
of
his
fortune
while
they
relinquished
the
more
important
charge
of
his
mind
to
the
care
of
mercenary
subalterns
he
cultivated
more
his
imagination
than
his
judgment
he
had
hence
that
high
romantic
feeling
of
honour
and
candour
which
daily
ruins
so
many
milliners'
apprentices
he
believed
all
to
sympathise
with
virtue
and
thought
that
vice
was
thrown
in
by
providence
merely
for
the
picturesque
effect
of
the
scene
as
we
see
in
romances
he
thought
that
the
misery
of
a
cottage
merely
consisted
in
the
vesting
of
clothes
which
were
as
warm
but
which
were
better
adapted
to
the
painter's
eye
by
their
irregular
folds
and
various
coloured
patches
he
thought
in
fine
that
the
dreams
of
poets
were
the
realities
of
life
he
was
handsome
frank
and
rich
for
these
reasons
upon
his
entering
into
the
gay
circles
many
mothers
surrounded
him
striving
which
should
describe
with
least
truth
their
languishing
or
romping
favourites
the
daughters
at
the
same
time
by
their
brightening
countenances
when
he
approached
and
by
their
sparkling
eyes
when
he
opened
his
lips
soon
led
him
into
false
notions
of
his
talents
and
his
merit
attached
as
he
was
to
the
romance
of
his
solitary
hours
he
was
startled
at
finding
that
except
in
the
tallow
and
wax
candles
that
flickered
not
from
the
presence
of
a
ghost
but
from
want
of
snuffing
there
was
no
foundation
in
real
life
for
any
of
that
congeries
of
pleasing
pictures
and
descriptions
contained
in
those
volumes
from
which
he
had
formed
his
study
finding
however
some
compensation
in
his
gratified
vanity
he
was
about
to
relinquish
his
dreams
when
the
extraordinary
being
we
have
above
described
crossed
him
in
his
career
he
watched
him
and
the
very
impossibility
of
forming
an
idea
of
the
character
of
a
man
entirely
absorbed
in
himself
who
gave
few
other
signs
of
his
observation
of
external
objects
than
the
tacit
assent
to
their
existence
implied
by
the
avoidance
of
their
contact
allowing
his
imagination
to
picture
every
thing
that
flattered
its
propensity
to
extravagant
ideas
he
soon
formed
this
object
into
the
hero
of
a
romance
and
determined
to
observe
the
offspring
of
his
fancy
rather
than
the
person
before
him
he
became
acquainted
with
him
paid
him
attentions
and
so
far
advanced
upon
his
notice
that
his
presence
was
always
recognised
he
gradually
learnt
that
lord
ruthven's
affairs
were
embarrassed
and
soon
found
from
the
notes
of
preparation
in
----
street
that
he
was
about
to
travel
desirous
of
gaining
some
information
respecting
this
singular
character
who
till
now
had
only
whetted
his
curiosity
he
hinted
to
his
guardians
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
perform
the
tour
which
for
many
generations
has
been
thought
necessary
to
enable
the
young
to
take
some
rapid
steps
in
the
career
of
vice
towards
putting
themselves
upon
an
equality
with
the
aged
and
not
allowing
them
to
appear
as
if
fallen
from
the
skies
whenever
scandalous
intrigues
are
mentioned
as
the
subjects
of
pleasantry
or
of
praise
according
to
the
degree
of
skill
shewn
in
carrying
them
on
they
consented
and
aubrey
immediately
mentioning
his
intentions
to
lord
ruthven
was
surprised
to
receive
from
him
a
proposal
to
join
him
flattered
by
such
a
mark
of
esteem
from
him
who
apparently
had
nothing
in
common
with
other
men
he
gladly
accepted
it
and
in
a
few
days
they
had
passed
the
circling
waters
hitherto
aubrey
had
had
no
opportunity
of
studying
lord
ruthven's
character
and
now
he
found
that
though
many
more
of
his
actions
were
exposed
to
his
view
the
results
offered
different
conclusions
from
the
apparent
motives
to
his
conduct
his
companion
was
profuse
in
his
liberality--the
idle
the
vagabond
and
the
beggar
received
from
his
hand
more
than
enough
to
relieve
their
immediate
wants
but
aubrey
could
not
avoid
remarking
that
it
was
not
upon
the
virtuous
reduced
to
indigence
by
the
misfortunes
attendant
even
upon
virtue
that
he
bestowed
his
alms--these
were
sent
from
the
door
with
hardly
suppressed
sneers
but
when
the
profligate
came
to
ask
something
not
to
relieve
his
wants
but
to
allow
him
to
wallow
in
his
lust
or
to
sink
him
still
deeper
in
his
iniquity
he
was
sent
away
with
rich
charity
this
was
however
attributed
by
him
to
the
greater
importunity
of
the
vicious
which
generally
prevails
over
the
retiring
bashfulness
of
the
virtuous
indigent
there
was
one
circumstance
about
the
charity
of
his
lordship
which
was
still
more
impressed
upon
his
mind
all
those
upon
whom
it
was
bestowed
inevitably
found
that
there
was
a
curse
upon
it
for
they
were
all
either
led
to
the
scaffold
or
sunk
to
the
lowest
and
the
most
abject
misery
at
brussels
and
other
towns
through
which
they
passed
aubrey
was
surprized
at
the
apparent
eagerness
with
which
his
companion
sought
for
the
centres
of
all
fashionable
vice
there
he
entered
into
all
the
spirit
of
the
faro
table
he
betted
and
always
gambled
with
success
except
where
the
known
sharper
was
his
antagonist
and
then
he
lost
even
more
than
he
gained
but
it
was
always
with
the
same
unchanging
face
with
which
he
generally
watched
the
society
around
it
was
not
however
so
when
he
encountered
the
rash
youthful
novice
or
the
luckless
father
of
a
numerous
family
then
his
very
wish
seemed
fortune's
law--this
apparent
abstractedness
of
mind
was
laid
aside
and
his
eyes
sparkled
with
more
fire
than
that
of
the
cat
whilst
dallying
with
the
half-dead
mouse
in
every
town
he
left
the
formerly
affluent
youth
torn
from
the
circle
he
adorned
cursing
in
the
solitude
of
a
dungeon
the
fate
that
had
drawn
him
within
the
reach
of
this
fiend
whilst
many
a
father
sat
frantic
amidst
the
speaking
looks
of
mute
hungry
children
without
a
single
farthing
of
his
late
immense
wealth
wherewith
to
buy
even
sufficient
to
satisfy
their
present
craving
yet
he
took
no
money
from
the
gambling
table
but
immediately
lost
to
the
ruiner
of
many
the
last
gilder
he
had
just
snatched
from
the
convulsive
grasp
of
the
innocent
this
might
but
be
the
result
of
a
certain
degree
of
knowledge
which
was
not
however
capable
of
combating
the
cunning
of
the
more
experienced
aubrey
often
wished
to
represent
this
to
his
friend
and
beg
him
to
resign
that
charity
and
pleasure
which
proved
the
ruin
of
all
and
did
not
tend
to
his
own
profit--but
he
delayed
it--for
each
day
he
hoped
his
friend
would
give
him
some
opportunity
of
speaking
frankly
and
openly
to
him
however
this
never
occurred
lord
ruthven
in
his
carriage
and
amidst
the
various
wild
and
rich
scenes
of
nature
was
always
the
same
his
eye
spoke
less
than
his
lip
and
though
aubrey
was
near
the
object
of
his
curiosity
he
obtained
no
greater
gratification
from
it
than
the
constant
excitement
of
vainly
wishing
to
break
that
mystery
which
to
his
exalted
imagination
began
to
assume
the
appearance
of
something
supernatural
they
soon
arrived
at
rome
and
aubrey
for
a
time
lost
sight
of
his
companion
he
left
him
in
daily
attendance
upon
the
morning
circle
of
an
italian
countess
whilst
he
went
in
search
of
the
memorials
of
another
almost
deserted
city
whilst
he
was
thus
engaged
letters
arrived
from
england
which
he
opened
with
eager
impatience
the
first
was
from
his
sister
breathing
nothing
but
affection
the
others
were
from
his
guardians
the
latter
astonished
him
if
it
had
before
entered
into
his
imagination
that
there
was
an
evil
power
resident
in
his
companion
these
seemed
to
give
him
sufficient
reason
for
the
belief
his
guardians
insisted
upon
his
immediately
leaving
his
friend
and
urged
that
his
character
was
dreadfully
vicious
for
that
the
possession
of
irresistible
powers
of
seduction
rendered
his
licentious
habits
more
dangerous
to
society
it
had
been
discovered
that
his
contempt
for
the
adultress
had
not
originated
in
hatred
of
her
character
but
that
he
had
required
to
enhance
his
gratification
that
his
victim
the
partner
of
his
guilt
should
be
hurled
from
the
pinnacle
of
unsullied
virtue
down
to
the
lowest
abyss
of
infamy
and
degradation
in
fine
that
all
those
females
whom
he
had
sought
apparently
on
account
of
their
virtue
had
since
his
departure
thrown
even
the
mask
aside
and
had
not
scrupled
to
expose
the
whole
deformity
of
their
vices
to
the
public
gaze
aubrey
determined
upon
leaving
one
whose
character
had
not
yet
shown
a
single
bright
point
on
which
to
rest
the
eye
he
resolved
to
invent
some
plausible
pretext
for
abandoning
him
altogether
purposing
in
the
mean
while
to
watch
him
more
closely
and
to
let
no
slight
circumstances
pass
by
unnoticed
he
entered
into
the
same
circle
and
soon
perceived
that
his
lordship
was
endeavouring
to
work
upon
the
inexperience
of
the
daughter
of
the
lady
whose
house
he
chiefly
frequented
in
italy
it
is
seldom
that
an
unmarried
female
is
met
with
in
society
he
was
therefore
obliged
to
carry
on
his
plans
in
secret
but
aubrey's
eye
followed
him
in
all
his
windings
and
soon
discovered
that
an
assignation
had
been
appointed
which
would
most
likely
end
in
the
ruin
of
an
innocent
though
thoughtless
girl
losing
no
time
he
entered
the
apartment
of
lord
ruthven
and
abruptly
asked
him
his
intentions
with
respect
to
the
lady
informing
him
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
aware
of
his
being
about
to
meet
her
that
very
night
lord
ruthven
answered
that
his
intentions
were
such
as
he
supposed
all
would
have
upon
such
an
occasion
and
upon
being
pressed
whether
he
intended
to
marry
her
merely
laughed
aubrey
retired
and
immediately
writing
a
note
to
say
that
from
that
moment
he
must
decline
accompanying
his
lordship
in
the
remainder
of
their
proposed
tour
he
ordered
his
servant
to
seek
other
apartments
and
calling
upon
the
mother
of
the
lady
informed
her
of
all
he
knew
not
only
with
regard
to
her
daughter
but
also
concerning
the
character
of
his
lordship
the
assignation
was
prevented
lord
ruthven
next
day
merely
sent
his
servant
to
notify
his
complete
assent
to
a
separation
but
did
not
hint
any
suspicion
of
his
plans
having
been
foiled
by
aubrey's
interposition
having
left
rome
aubrey
directed
his
steps
towards
greece
and
crossing
the
peninsula
soon
found
himself
at
athens
he
then
fixed
his
residence
in
the
house
of
a
greek
and
soon
occupied
himself
in
tracing
the
faded
records
of
ancient
glory
upon
monuments
that
apparently
ashamed
of
chronicling
the
deeds
of
freemen
only
before
slaves
had
hidden
themselves
beneath
the
sheltering
soil
or
many
coloured
lichen
under
the
same
roof
as
himself
existed
a
being
so
beautiful
and
delicate
that
she
might
have
formed
the
model
for
a
painter
wishing
to
pourtray
on
canvass
the
promised
hope
of
the
faithful
in
mahomet's
paradise
save
that
her
eyes
spoke
too
much
mind
for
any
one
to
think
she
could
belong
to
those
who
had
no
souls
as
she
danced
upon
the
plain
or
tripped
along
the
mountain's
side
one
would
have
thought
the
gazelle
a
poor
type
of
her
beauties
for
who
would
have
exchanged
her
eye
apparently
the
eye
of
animated
nature
for
that
sleepy
luxurious
look
of
the
animal
suited
but
to
the
taste
of
an
epicure
the
light
step
of
ianthe
often
accompanied
aubrey
in
his
search
after
antiquities
and
often
would
the
unconscious
girl
engaged
in
the
pursuit
of
a
kashmere
butterfly
show
the
whole
beauty
of
her
form
floating
as
it
were
upon
the
wind
to
the
eager
gaze
of
him
who
forgot
the
letters
he
had
just
decyphered
upon
an
almost
effaced
tablet
in
the
contemplation
of
her
sylph-like
figure
often
would
her
tresses
falling
as
she
flitted
around
exhibit
in
the
sun's
ray
such
delicately
brilliant
and
swiftly
fading
hues
it
might
well
excuse
the
forgetfulness
of
the
antiquary
who
let
escape
from
his
mind
the
very
object
he
had
before
thought
of
vital
importance
to
the
proper
interpretation
of
a
passage
in
pausanias
but
why
attempt
to
describe
charms
which
all
feel
but
none
can
appreciate--it
was
innocence
youth
and
beauty
unaffected
by
crowded
drawing-rooms
and
stifling
balls
whilst
he
drew
those
remains
of
which
he
wished
to
preserve
a
memorial
for
his
future
hours
she
would
stand
by
and
watch
the
magic
effects
of
his
pencil
in
tracing
the
scenes
of
her
native
place
she
would
then
describe
to
him
the
circling
dance
upon
the
open
plain
would
paint
to
him
in
all
the
glowing
colours
of
youthful
memory
the
marriage
pomp
she
remembered
viewing
in
her
infancy
and
then
turning
to
subjects
that
had
evidently
made
a
greater
impression
upon
her
mind
would
tell
him
all
the
supernatural
tales
of
her
nurse
her
earnestness
and
apparent
belief
of
what
she
narrated
excited
the
interest
even
of
aubrey
and
often
as
she
told
him
the
tale
of
the
living
vampyre
who
had
passed
years
amidst
his
friends
and
dearest
ties
forced
every
year
by
feeding
upon
the
life
of
a
lovely
female
to
prolong
his
existence
for
the
ensuing
months
his
blood
would
run
cold
whilst
he
attempted
to
laugh
her
out
of
such
idle
and
horrible
fantasies
but
ianthe
cited
to
him
the
names
of
old
men
who
had
at
last
detected
one
living
among
themselves
after
several
of
their
near
relatives
and
children
had
been
found
marked
with
the
stamp
of
the
fiend's
appetite
and
when
she
found
him
so
incredulous
she
begged
of
him
to
believe
her
for
it
had
been
remarked
that
those
who
had
dared
to
question
their
existence
always
had
some
proof
given
which
obliged
them
with
grief
and
heartbreaking
to
confess
it
was
true
she
detailed
to
him
the
traditional
appearance
of
these
monsters
and
his
horror
was
increased
by
hearing
a
pretty
accurate
description
of
lord
ruthven
he
however
still
persisted
in
persuading
her
that
there
could
be
no
truth
in
her
fears
though
at
the
same
time
he
wondered
at
the
many
coincidences
which
had
all
tended
to
excite
a
belief
in
the
supernatural
power
of
lord
ruthven
aubrey
began
to
attach
himself
more
and
more
to
ianthe
her
innocence
so
contrasted
with
all
the
affected
virtues
of
the
women
among
whom
he
had
sought
for
his
vision
of
romance
won
his
heart
and
while
he
ridiculed
the
idea
of
a
young
man
of
english
habits
marrying
an
uneducated
greek
girl
still
he
found
himself
more
and
more
attached
to
the
almost
fairy
form
before
him
he
would
tear
himself
at
times
from
her
and
forming
a
plan
for
some
antiquarian
research
he
would
depart
determined
not
to
return
until
his
object
was
attained
but
he
always
found
it
impossible
to
fix
his
attention
upon
the
ruins
around
him
whilst
in
his
mind
he
retained
an
image
that
seemed
alone
the
rightful
possessor
of
his
thoughts
ianthe
was
unconscious
of
his
love
and
was
ever
the
same
frank
infantile
being
he
had
first
known
she
always
seemed
to
part
from
him
with
reluctance
but
it
was
because
she
had
no
longer
any
one
with
whom
she
could
visit
her
favourite
haunts
whilst
her
guardian
was
occupied
in
sketching
or
uncovering
some
fragment
which
had
yet
escaped
the
destructive
hand
of
time
she
had
appealed
to
her
parents
on
the
subject
of
vampyres
and
they
both
with
several
present
affirmed
their
existence
pale
with
horror
at
the
very
name
soon
after
aubrey
determined
to
proceed
upon
one
of
his
excursions
which
was
to
detain
him
for
a
few
hours
when
they
heard
the
name
of
the
place
they
all
at
once
begged
of
him
not
to
return
at
night
as
he
must
necessarily
pass
through
a
wood
where
no
greek
would
ever
remain
after
the
day
had
closed
upon
any
consideration
they
described
it
as
the
resort
of
the
vampyres
in
their
nocturnal
orgies
and
denounced
the
most
heavy
evils
as
impending
upon
him
who
dared
to
cross
their
path
aubrey
made
light
of
their
representations
and
tried
to
laugh
them
out
of
the
idea
but
when
he
saw
them
shudder
at
his
daring
thus
to
mock
a
superior
infernal
power
the
very
name
of
which
apparently
made
their
blood
freeze
he
was
silent
next
morning
aubrey
set
off
upon
his
excursion
unattended
he
was
surprised
to
observe
the
melancholy
face
of
his
host
and
was
concerned
to
find
that
his
words
mocking
the
belief
of
those
horrible
fiends
had
inspired
them
with
such
terror
when
he
was
about
to
depart
ianthe
came
to
the
side
of
his
horse
and
earnestly
begged
of
him
to
return
ere
night
allowed
the
power
of
these
beings
to
be
put
in
action--he
promised
he
was
however
so
occupied
in
his
research
that
he
did
not
perceive
that
day-light
would
soon
end
and
that
in
the
horizon
there
was
one
of
those
specks
which
in
the
warmer
climates
so
rapidly
gather
into
a
tremendous
mass
and
pour
all
their
rage
upon
the
devoted
country--he
at
last
however
mounted
his
horse
determined
to
make
up
by
speed
for
his
delay
but
it
was
too
late
twilight
in
these
southern
climates
is
almost
unknown
immediately
the
sun
sets
night
begins
and
ere
he
had
advanced
far
the
power
of
the
storm
was
above--its
echoing
thunders
had
scarcely
an
interval
of
rest--its
thick
heavy
rain
forced
its
way
through
the
canopying
foliage
whilst
the
blue
forked
lightning
seemed
to
fall
and
radiate
at
his
very
feet
suddenly
his
horse
took
fright
and
he
was
carried
with
dreadful
rapidity
through
the
entangled
forest
the
animal
at
last
through
fatigue
stopped
and
he
found
by
the
glare
of
lightning
that
he
was
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
hovel
that
hardly
lifted
itself
up
from
the
masses
of
dead
leaves
and
brushwood
which
surrounded
it
dismounting
he
approached
hoping
to
find
some
one
to
guide
him
to
the
town
or
at
least
trusting
to
obtain
shelter
from
the
pelting
of
the
storm
as
he
approached
the
thunders
for
a
moment
silent
allowed
him
to
hear
the
dreadful
shrieks
of
a
woman
mingling
with
the
stifled
exultant
mockery
of
a
laugh
continued
in
one
almost
unbroken
sound--he
was
startled
but
roused
by
the
thunder
which
again
rolled
over
his
head
he
with
a
sudden
effort
forced
open
the
door
of
the
hut
he
found
himself
in
utter
darkness
the
sound
however
guided
him
he
was
apparently
unperceived
for
though
he
called
still
the
sounds
continued
and
no
notice
was
taken
of
him
he
found
himself
in
contact
with
some
one
whom
he
immediately
seized
when
a
voice
cried
again
baffled
to
which
a
loud
laugh
succeeded
and
he
felt
himself
grappled
by
one
whose
strength
seemed
superhuman
determined
to
sell
his
life
as
dearly
as
he
could
he
struggled
but
it
was
in
vain
he
was
lifted
from
his
feet
and
hurled
with
enormous
force
against
the
ground--his
enemy
threw
himself
upon
him
and
kneeling
upon
his
breast
had
placed
his
hands
upon
his
throat--when
the
glare
of
many
torches
penetrating
through
the
hole
that
gave
light
in
the
day
disturbed
him--he
instantly
rose
and
leaving
his
prey
rushed
through
the
door
and
in
a
moment
the
crashing
of
the
branches
as
he
broke
through
the
wood
was
no
longer
heard
the
storm
was
now
still
and
aubrey
incapable
of
moving
was
soon
heard
by
those
without
they
entered
the
light
of
their
torches
fell
upon
the
mud
walls
and
the
thatch
loaded
on
every
individual
straw
with
heavy
flakes
of
soot
at
the
desire
of
aubrey
they
searched
for
her
who
had
attracted
him
by
her
cries
he
was
again
left
in
darkness
but
what
was
his
horror
when
the
light
of
the
torches
once
more
burst
upon
him
to
perceive
the
airy
form
of
his
fair
conductress
brought
in
a
lifeless
corse
he
shut
his
eyes
hoping
that
it
was
but
a
vision
arising
from
his
disturbed
imagination
but
he
again
saw
the
same
form
when
he
unclosed
them
stretched
by
his
side
there
was
no
colour
upon
her
cheek
not
even
upon
her
lip
yet
there
was
a
stillness
about
her
face
that
seemed
almost
as
attaching
as
the
life
that
once
dwelt
there--upon
her
neck
and
breast
was
blood
and
upon
her
throat
were
the
marks
of
teeth
having
opened
the
vein--to
this
the
men
pointed
crying
simultaneously
struck
with
horror
a
vampyre
a
vampyre
a
litter
was
quickly
formed
and
aubrey
was
laid
by
the
side
of
her
who
had
lately
been
to
him
the
object
of
so
many
bright
and
fairy
visions
now
fallen
with
the
flower
of
life
that
had
died
within
her
he
knew
not
what
his
thoughts
were--his
mind
was
benumbed
and
seemed
to
shun
reflection
and
take
refuge
in
vacancy--he
held
almost
unconsciously
in
his
hand
a
naked
dagger
of
a
particular
construction
which
had
been
found
in
the
hut
they
were
soon
met
by
different
parties
who
had
been
engaged
in
the
search
of
her
whom
a
mother
had
missed
their
lamentable
cries
as
they
approached
the
city
forewarned
the
parents
of
some
dreadful
catastrophe
--to
describe
their
grief
would
be
impossible
but
when
they
ascertained
the
cause
of
their
child's
death
they
looked
at
aubrey
and
pointed
to
the
corse
they
were
inconsolable
both
died
broken-hearted
aubrey
being
put
to
bed
was
seized
with
a
most
violent
fever
and
was
often
delirious
in
these
intervals
he
would
call
upon
lord
ruthven
and
upon
ianthe--by
some
unaccountable
combination
he
seemed
to
beg
of
his
former
companion
to
spare
the
being
he
loved
at
other
times
he
would
imprecate
maledictions
upon
his
head
and
curse
him
as
her
destroyer
lord
ruthven
chanced
at
this
time
to
arrive
at
athens
and
from
whatever
motive
upon
hearing
of
the
state
of
aubrey
immediately
placed
himself
in
the
same
house
and
became
his
constant
attendant
when
the
latter
recovered
from
his
delirium
he
was
horrified
and
startled
at
the
sight
of
him
whose
image
he
had
now
combined
with
that
of
a
vampyre
but
lord
ruthven
by
his
kind
words
implying
almost
repentance
for
the
fault
that
had
caused
their
separation
and
still
more
by
the
attention
anxiety
and
care
which
he
showed
soon
reconciled
him
to
his
presence
his
lordship
seemed
quite
changed
he
no
longer
appeared
that
apathetic
being
who
had
so
astonished
aubrey
but
as
soon
as
his
convalescence
began
to
be
rapid
he
again
gradually
retired
into
the
same
state
of
mind
and
aubrey
perceived
no
difference
from
the
former
man
except
that
at
times
he
was
surprised
to
meet
his
gaze
fixed
intently
upon
him
with
a
smile
of
malicious
exultation
playing
upon
his
lips
he
knew
not
why
but
this
smile
haunted
him
during
the
last
stage
of
the
invalid's
recovery
lord
ruthven
was
apparently
engaged
in
watching
the
tideless
waves
raised
by
the
cooling
breeze
or
in
marking
the
progress
of
those
orbs
circling
like
our
world
the
moveless
sun--indeed
he
appeared
to
wish
to
avoid
the
eyes
of
all
aubrey's
mind
by
this
shock
was
much
weakened
and
that
elasticity
of
spirit
which
had
once
so
distinguished
him
now
seemed
to
have
fled
for
ever
he
was
now
as
much
a
lover
of
solitude
and
silence
as
lord
ruthven
but
much
as
he
wished
for
solitude
his
mind
could
not
find
it
in
the
neighbourhood
of
athens
if
he
sought
it
amidst
the
ruins
he
had
formerly
frequented
ianthe's
form
stood
by
his
side--if
he
sought
it
in
the
woods
her
light
step
would
appear
wandering
amidst
the
underwood
in
quest
of
the
modest
violet
then
suddenly
turning
round
would
show
to
his
wild
imagination
her
pale
face
and
wounded
throat
with
a
meek
smile
upon
her
lips
he
determined
to
fly
scenes
every
feature
of
which
created
such
bitter
associations
in
his
mind
he
proposed
to
lord
ruthven
to
whom
he
held
himself
bound
by
the
tender
care
he
had
taken
of
him
during
his
illness
that
they
should
visit
those
parts
of
greece
neither
had
yet
seen
they
travelled
in
every
direction
and
sought
every
spot
to
which
a
recollection
could
be
attached
but
though
they
thus
hastened
from
place
to
place
yet
they
seemed
not
to
heed
what
they
gazed
upon
they
heard
much
of
robbers
but
they
gradually
began
to
slight
these
reports
which
they
imagined
were
only
the
invention
of
individuals
whose
interest
it
was
to
excite
the
generosity
of
those
whom
they
defended
from
pretended
dangers
in
consequence
of
thus
neglecting
the
advice
of
the
inhabitants
on
one
occasion
they
travelled
with
only
a
few
guards
more
to
serve
as
guides
than
as
a
defence
upon
entering
however
a
narrow
defile
at
the
bottom
of
which
was
the
bed
of
a
torrent
with
large
masses
of
rock
brought
down
from
the
neighbouring
precipices
they
had
reason
to
repent
their
negligence
for
scarcely
were
the
whole
of
the
party
engaged
in
the
narrow
pass
when
they
were
startled
by
the
whistling
of
bullets
close
to
their
heads
and
by
the
echoed
report
of
several
guns
in
an
instant
their
guards
had
left
them
and
placing
themselves
behind
rocks
had
begun
to
fire
in
the
direction
whence
the
report
came
lord
ruthven
and
aubrey
imitating
their
example
retired
for
a
moment
behind
the
sheltering
turn
of
the
defile
but
ashamed
of
being
thus
detained
by
a
foe
who
with
insulting
shouts
bade
them
advance
and
being
exposed
to
unresisting
slaughter
if
any
of
the
robbers
should
climb
above
and
take
them
in
the
rear
they
determined
at
once
to
rush
forward
in
search
of
the
enemy
hardly
had
they
lost
the
shelter
of
the
rock
when
lord
ruthven
received
a
shot
in
the
shoulder
which
brought
him
to
the
ground
aubrey
hastened
to
his
assistance
and
no
longer
heeding
the
contest
or
his
own
peril
was
soon
surprised
by
seeing
the
robbers'
faces
around
him--his
guards
having
upon
lord
ruthven's
being
wounded
immediately
thrown
up
their
arms
and
surrendered
by
promises
of
great
reward
aubrey
soon
induced
them
to
convey
his
wounded
friend
to
a
neighbouring
cabin
and
having
agreed
upon
a
ransom
he
was
no
more
disturbed
by
their
presence--they
being
content
merely
to
guard
the
entrance
till
their
comrade
should
return
with
the
promised
sum
for
which
he
had
an
order
lord
ruthven's
strength
rapidly
decreased
in
two
days
mortification
ensued
and
death
seemed
advancing
with
hasty
steps
his
conduct
and
appearance
had
not
changed
he
seemed
as
unconscious
of
pain
as
he
had
been
of
the
objects
about
him
but
towards
the
close
of
the
last
evening
his
mind
became
apparently
uneasy
and
his
eye
often
fixed
upon
aubrey
who
was
induced
to
offer
his
assistance
with
more
than
usual
earnestness--assist
me
you
may
save
me--you
may
do
more
than
that--i
mean
not
my
life
i
heed
the
death
of
my
existence
as
little
as
that
of
the
passing
day
but
you
may
save
my
honour
your
friend's
honour--how
tell
me
how
i
would
do
any
thing
replied
aubrey--i
need
but
little--my
life
ebbs
apace--i
cannot
explain
the
whole--but
if
you
would
conceal
all
you
know
of
me
my
honour
were
free
from
stain
in
the
world's
mouth--and
if
my
death
were
unknown
for
some
time
in
england--i--i--but
life--it
shall
not
be
known--swear
cried
the
dying
man
raising
himself
with
exultant
violence
swear
by
all
your
soul
reveres
by
all
your
nature
fears
swear
that
for
a
year
and
a
day
you
will
not
impart
your
knowledge
of
my
crimes
or
death
to
any
living
being
in
any
way
whatever
may
happen
or
whatever
you
may
see
--his
eyes
seemed
bursting
from
their
sockets
i
swear
said
aubrey
he
sunk
laughing
upon
his
pillow
and
breathed
no
more
aubrey
retired
to
rest
but
did
not
sleep
the
many
circumstances
attending
his
acquaintance
with
this
man
rose
upon
his
mind
and
he
knew
not
why
when
he
remembered
his
oath
a
cold
shivering
came
over
him
as
if
from
the
presentiment
of
something
horrible
awaiting
him
rising
early
in
the
morning
he
was
about
to
enter
the
hovel
in
which
he
had
left
the
corpse
when
a
robber
met
him
and
informed
him
that
it
was
no
longer
there
having
been
conveyed
by
himself
and
comrades
upon
his
retiring
to
the
pinnacle
of
a
neighbouring
mount
according
to
a
promise
they
had
given
his
lordship
that
it
should
be
exposed
to
the
first
cold
ray
of
the
moon
that
rose
after
his
death
aubrey
astonished
and
taking
several
of
the
men
determined
to
go
and
bury
it
upon
the
spot
where
it
lay
but
when
he
had
mounted
to
the
summit
he
found
no
trace
of
either
the
corpse
or
the
clothes
though
the
robbers
swore
they
pointed
out
the
identical
rock
on
which
they
had
laid
the
body
for
a
time
his
mind
was
bewildered
in
conjectures
but
he
at
last
returned
convinced
that
they
had
buried
the
corpse
for
the
sake
of
the
clothes
weary
of
a
country
in
which
he
had
met
with
such
terrible
misfortunes
and
in
which
all
apparently
conspired
to
heighten
that
superstitious
melancholy
that
had
seized
upon
his
mind
he
resolved
to
leave
it
and
soon
arrived
at
smyrna
while
waiting
for
a
vessel
to
convey
him
to
otranto
or
to
naples
he
occupied
himself
in
arranging
those
effects
he
had
with
him
belonging
to
lord
ruthven
amongst
other
things
there
was
a
case
containing
several
weapons
of
offence
more
or
less
adapted
to
ensure
the
death
of
the
victim
there
were
several
daggers
and
ataghans
whilst
turning
them
over
and
examining
their
curious
forms
what
was
his
surprise
at
finding
a
sheath
apparently
ornamented
in
the
same
style
as
the
dagger
discovered
in
the
fatal
hut--he
shuddered--hastening
to
gain
further
proof
he
found
the
weapon
and
his
horror
may
be
imagined
when
he
discovered
that
it
fitted
though
peculiarly
shaped
the
sheath
he
held
in
his
hand
his
eyes
seemed
to
need
no
further
certainty--they
seemed
gazing
to
be
bound
to
the
dagger
yet
still
he
wished
to
disbelieve
but
the
particular
form
the
same
varying
tints
upon
the
haft
and
sheath
were
alike
in
splendour
on
both
and
left
no
room
for
doubt
there
were
also
drops
of
blood
on
each
he
left
smyrna
and
on
his
way
home
at
rome
his
first
inquiries
were
concerning
the
lady
he
had
attempted
to
snatch
from
lord
ruthven's
seductive
arts
her
parents
were
in
distress
their
fortune
ruined
and
she
had
not
been
heard
of
since
the
departure
of
his
lordship
aubrey's
mind
became
almost
broken
under
so
many
repeated
horrors
he
was
afraid
that
this
lady
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
destroyer
of
ianthe
he
became
morose
and
silent
and
his
only
occupation
consisted
in
urging
the
speed
of
the
postilions
as
if
he
were
going
to
save
the
life
of
some
one
he
held
dear
he
arrived
at
calais
a
breeze
which
seemed
obedient
to
his
will
soon
wafted
him
to
the
english
shores
and
he
hastened
to
the
mansion
of
his
fathers
and
there
for
a
moment
appeared
to
lose
in
the
embraces
and
caresses
of
his
sister
all
memory
of
the
past
if
she
before
by
her
infantine
caresses
had
gained
his
affection
now
that
the
woman
began
to
appear
she
was
still
more
attaching
as
a
companion
miss
aubrey
had
not
that
winning
grace
which
gains
the
gaze
and
applause
of
the
drawing-room
assemblies
there
was
none
of
that
light
brilliancy
which
only
exists
in
the
heated
atmosphere
of
a
crowded
apartment
her
blue
eye
was
never
lit
up
by
the
levity
of
the
mind
beneath
there
was
a
melancholy
charm
about
it
which
did
not
seem
to
arise
from
misfortune
but
from
some
feeling
within
that
appeared
to
indicate
a
soul
conscious
of
a
brighter
realm
her
step
was
not
that
light
footing
which
strays
where'er
a
butterfly
or
a
colour
may
attract--it
was
sedate
and
pensive
when
alone
her
face
was
never
brightened
by
the
smile
of
joy
but
when
her
brother
breathed
to
her
his
affection
and
would
in
her
presence
forget
those
griefs
she
knew
destroyed
his
rest
who
would
have
exchanged
her
smile
for
that
of
the
voluptuary
it
seemed
as
if
those
eyes--that
face
were
then
playing
in
the
light
of
their
own
native
sphere
she
was
yet
only
eighteen
and
had
not
been
presented
to
the
world
it
having
been
thought
by
her
guardians
more
fit
that
her
presentation
should
be
delayed
until
her
brother's
return
from
the
continent
when
he
might
be
her
protector
it
was
now
therefore
resolved
that
the
next
drawing-room
which
was
fast
approaching
should
be
the
epoch
of
her
entry
into
the
busy
scene
aubrey
would
rather
have
remained
in
the
mansion
of
his
fathers
and
fed
upon
the
melancholy
which
overpowered
him
he
could
not
feel
interest
about
the
frivolities
of
fashionable
strangers
when
his
mind
had
been
so
torn
by
the
events
he
had
witnessed
but
he
determined
to
sacrifice
his
own
comfort
to
the
protection
of
his
sister
they
soon
arrived
in
town
and
prepared
for
the
next
day
which
had
been
announced
as
a
drawing-room
the
crowd
was
excessive--a
drawing-room
had
not
been
held
for
a
long
time
and
all
who
were
anxious
to
bask
in
the
smile
of
royalty
hastened
thither
aubrey
was
there
with
his
sister
while
he
was
standing
in
a
corner
by
himself
heedless
of
all
around
him
engaged
in
the
remembrance
that
the
first
time
he
had
seen
lord
ruthven
was
in
that
very
place--he
felt
himself
suddenly
seized
by
the
arm
and
a
voice
he
recognized
too
well
sounded
in
his
ear--remember
your
oath
he
had
hardly
courage
to
turn
fearful
of
seeing
a
spectre
that
would
blast
him
when
he
perceived
at
a
little
distance
the
same
figure
which
had
attracted
his
notice
on
this
spot
upon
his
first
entry
into
society
he
gazed
till
his
limbs
almost
refusing
to
bear
their
weight
he
was
obliged
to
take
the
arm
of
a
friend
and
forcing
a
passage
through
the
crowd
he
threw
himself
into
his
carriage
and
was
driven
home
he
paced
the
room
with
hurried
steps
and
fixed
his
hands
upon
his
head
as
if
he
were
afraid
his
thoughts
were
bursting
from
his
brain
lord
ruthven
again
before
him--circumstances
started
up
in
dreadful
array--the
dagger--his
oath--he
roused
himself
he
could
not
believe
it
possible--the
dead
rise
again--he
thought
his
imagination
had
conjured
up
the
image
his
mind
was
resting
upon
it
was
impossible
that
it
could
be
real--he
determined
therefore
to
go
again
into
society
for
though
he
attempted
to
ask
concerning
lord
ruthven
the
name
hung
upon
his
lips
and
he
could
not
succeed
in
gaining
information
he
went
a
few
nights
after
with
his
sister
to
the
assembly
of
a
near
relation
leaving
her
under
the
protection
of
a
matron
he
retired
into
a
recess
and
there
gave
himself
up
to
his
own
devouring
thoughts
perceiving
at
last
that
many
were
leaving
he
roused
himself
and
entering
another
room
found
his
sister
surrounded
by
several
apparently
in
earnest
conversation
he
attempted
to
pass
and
get
near
her
when
one
whom
he
requested
to
move
turned
round
and
revealed
to
him
those
features
he
most
abhorred
he
sprang
forward
seized
his
sister's
arm
and
with
hurried
step
forced
her
towards
the
street
at
the
door
he
found
himself
impeded
by
the
crowd
of
servants
who
were
waiting
for
their
lords
and
while
he
was
engaged
in
passing
them
he
again
heard
that
voice
whisper
close
to
him--remember
your
oath--he
did
not
dare
to
turn
but
hurrying
his
sister
soon
reached
home
aubrey
became
almost
distracted
if
before
his
mind
had
been
absorbed
by
one
subject
how
much
more
completely
was
it
engrossed
now
that
the
certainty
of
the
monster's
living
again
pressed
upon
his
thoughts
his
sister's
attentions
were
now
unheeded
and
it
was
in
vain
that
she
intreated
him
to
explain
to
her
what
had
caused
his
abrupt
conduct
he
only
uttered
a
few
words
and
those
terrified
her
the
more
he
thought
the
more
he
was
bewildered
his
oath
startled
him--was
he
then
to
allow
this
monster
to
roam
bearing
ruin
upon
his
breath
amidst
all
he
held
dear
and
not
avert
its
progress
his
very
sister
might
have
been
touched
by
him
but
even
if
he
were
to
break
his
oath
and
disclose
his
suspicions
who
would
believe
him
he
thought
of
employing
his
own
hand
to
free
the
world
from
such
a
wretch
but
death
he
remembered
had
been
already
mocked
for
days
he
remained
in
this
state
shut
up
in
his
room
he
saw
no
one
and
ate
only
when
his
sister
came
who
with
eyes
streaming
with
tears
besought
him
for
her
sake
to
support
nature
at
last
no
longer
capable
of
bearing
stillness
and
solitude
he
left
his
house
roamed
from
street
to
street
anxious
to
fly
that
image
which
haunted
him
his
dress
became
neglected
and
he
wandered
as
often
exposed
to
the
noon-day
sun
as
to
the
midnight
damps
he
was
no
longer
to
be
recognized
at
first
he
returned
with
the
evening
to
the
house
but
at
last
he
laid
him
down
to
rest
wherever
fatigue
overtook
him
his
sister
anxious
for
his
safety
employed
people
to
follow
him
but
they
were
soon
distanced
by
him
who
fled
from
a
pursuer
swifter
than
any--from
thought
his
conduct
however
suddenly
changed
struck
with
the
idea
that
he
left
by
his
absence
the
whole
of
his
friends
with
a
fiend
amongst
them
of
whose
presence
they
were
unconscious
he
determined
to
enter
again
into
society
and
watch
him
closely
anxious
to
forewarn
in
spite
of
his
oath
all
whom
lord
ruthven
approached
with
intimacy
but
when
he
entered
into
a
room
his
haggard
and
suspicious
looks
were
so
striking
his
inward
shudderings
so
visible
that
his
sister
was
at
last
obliged
to
beg
of
him
to
abstain
from
seeking
for
her
sake
a
society
which
affected
him
so
strongly
when
however
remonstrance
proved
unavailing
the
guardians
thought
proper
to
interpose
and
fearing
that
his
mind
was
becoming
alienated
they
thought
it
high
time
to
resume
again
that
trust
which
had
been
before
imposed
upon
them
by
aubrey's
parents
desirous
of
saving
him
from
the
injuries
and
sufferings
he
had
daily
encountered
in
his
wanderings
and
of
preventing
him
from
exposing
to
the
general
eye
those
marks
of
what
they
considered
folly
they
engaged
a
physician
to
reside
in
the
house
and
take
constant
care
of
him
he
hardly
appeared
to
notice
it
so
completely
was
his
mind
absorbed
by
one
terrible
subject
his
incoherence
became
at
last
so
great
that
he
was
confined
to
his
chamber
there
he
would
often
lie
for
days
incapable
of
being
roused
he
had
become
emaciated
his
eyes
had
attained
a
glassy
lustre--the
only
sign
of
affection
and
recollection
remaining
displayed
itself
upon
the
entry
of
his
sister
then
he
would
sometimes
start
and
seizing
her
hands
with
looks
that
severely
afflicted
her
he
would
desire
her
not
to
touch
him
oh
do
not
touch
him--if
your
love
for
me
is
aught
do
not
go
near
him
when
however
she
inquired
to
whom
he
referred
his
only
answer
was
true
true
and
again
he
sank
into
a
state
whence
not
even
she
could
rouse
him
this
lasted
many
months
gradually
however
as
the
year
was
passing
his
incoherences
became
less
frequent
and
his
mind
threw
off
a
portion
of
its
gloom
whilst
his
guardians
observed
that
several
times
in
the
day
he
would
count
upon
his
fingers
a
definite
number
and
then
smile
the
time
had
nearly
elapsed
when
upon
the
last
day
of
the
year
one
of
his
guardians
entering
his
room
began
to
converse
with
his
physician
upon
the
melancholy
circumstance
of
aubrey's
being
in
so
awful
a
situation
when
his
sister
was
going
next
day
to
be
married
instantly
aubrey's
attention
was
attracted
he
asked
anxiously
to
whom
glad
of
this
mark
of
returning
intellect
of
which
they
feared
he
had
been
deprived
they
mentioned
the
name
of
the
earl
of
marsden
thinking
this
was
a
young
earl
whom
he
had
met
with
in
society
aubrey
seemed
pleased
and
astonished
them
still
more
by
his
expressing
his
intention
to
be
present
at
the
nuptials
and
desiring
to
see
his
sister
they
answered
not
but
in
a
few
minutes
his
sister
was
with
him
he
was
apparently
again
capable
of
being
affected
by
the
influence
of
her
lovely
smile
for
he
pressed
her
to
his
breast
and
kissed
her
cheek
wet
with
tears
flowing
at
the
thought
of
her
brother's
being
once
more
alive
to
the
feelings
of
affection
he
began
to
speak
with
all
his
wonted
warmth
and
to
congratulate
her
upon
her
marriage
with
a
person
so
distinguished
for
rank
and
every
accomplishment
when
he
suddenly
perceived
a
locket
upon
her
breast
opening
it
what
was
his
surprise
at
beholding
the
features
of
the
monster
who
had
so
long
influenced
his
life
he
seized
the
portrait
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
and
trampled
it
under
foot
upon
her
asking
him
why
he
thus
destroyed
the
resemblance
of
her
future
husband
he
looked
as
if
he
did
not
understand
her--then
seizing
her
hands
and
gazing
on
her
with
a
frantic
expression
of
countenance
he
bade
her
swear
that
she
would
never
wed
this
monster
for
he----
but
he
could
not
advance--it
seemed
as
if
that
voice
again
bade
him
remember
his
oath--he
turned
suddenly
round
thinking
lord
ruthven
was
near
him
but
saw
no
one
in
the
meantime
the
guardians
and
physician
who
had
heard
the
whole
and
thought
this
was
but
a
return
of
his
disorder
entered
and
forcing
him
from
miss
aubrey
desired
her
to
leave
him
he
fell
upon
his
knees
to
them
he
implored
he
begged
of
them
to
delay
but
for
one
day
they
attributing
this
to
the
insanity
they
imagined
had
taken
possession
of
his
mind
endeavoured
to
pacify
him
and
retired
lord
ruthven
had
called
the
morning
after
the
drawing-room
and
had
been
refused
with
every
one
else
when
he
heard
of
aubrey's
ill
health
he
readily
understood
himself
to
be
the
cause
of
it
but
when
he
learned
that
he
was
deemed
insane
his
exultation
and
pleasure
could
hardly
be
concealed
from
those
among
whom
he
had
gained
this
information
he
hastened
to
the
house
of
his
former
companion
and
by
constant
attendance
and
the
pretence
of
great
affection
for
the
brother
and
interest
in
his
fate
he
gradually
won
the
ear
of
miss
aubrey
who
could
resist
his
power
his
tongue
had
dangers
and
toils
to
recount--could
speak
of
himself
as
of
an
individual
having
no
sympathy
with
any
being
on
the
crowded
earth
save
with
her
to
whom
he
addressed
himself--could
tell
how
since
he
knew
her
his
existence
had
begun
to
seem
worthy
of
preservation
if
it
were
merely
that
he
might
listen
to
her
soothing
accents--in
fine
he
knew
so
well
how
to
use
the
serpent's
art
or
such
was
the
will
of
fate
that
he
gained
her
affections
the
title
of
the
elder
branch
falling
at
length
to
him
he
obtained
an
important
embassy
which
served
as
an
excuse
for
hastening
the
marriage
in
spite
of
her
brother's
deranged
state
which
was
to
take
place
the
very
day
before
his
departure
for
the
continent
aubrey
when
he
was
left
by
the
physician
and
his
guardians
attempted
to
bribe
the
servants
but
in
vain
he
asked
for
pen
and
paper
it
was
given
him
he
wrote
a
letter
to
his
sister
conjuring
her
as
she
valued
her
own
happiness
her
own
honour
and
the
honour
of
those
now
in
the
grave
who
once
held
her
in
their
arms
as
their
hope
and
the
hope
of
their
house
to
delay
but
for
a
few
hours
that
marriage
on
which
he
denounced
the
most
heavy
curses
the
servants
promised
they
would
deliver
it
but
giving
it
to
the
physician
he
thought
it
better
not
to
harass
any
more
the
mind
of
miss
aubrey
by
what
he
considered
the
ravings
of
a
maniac
night
passed
on
without
rest
to
the
busy
inmates
of
the
house
and
aubrey
heard
with
a
horror
that
may
more
easily
be
conceived
than
described
the
notes
of
busy
preparation
morning
came
and
the
sound
of
carriages
broke
upon
his
ear
aubrey
grew
almost
frantic
the
curiosity
of
the
servants
at
last
overcame
their
vigilance
they
gradually
stole
away
leaving
him
in
the
custody
of
an
helpless
old
woman
he
seized
the
opportunity
with
one
bound
was
out
of
the
room
and
in
a
moment
found
himself
in
the
apartment
where
all
were
nearly
assembled
lord
ruthven
was
the
first
to
perceive
him
he
immediately
approached
and
taking
his
arm
by
force
hurried
him
from
the
room
speechless
with
rage
when
on
the
staircase
lord
ruthven
whispered
in
his
ear--remember
your
oath
and
know
if
not
my
bride
to
day
your
sister
is
dishonoured
women
are
frail
so
saying
he
pushed
him
towards
his
attendants
who
roused
by
the
old
woman
had
come
in
search
of
him
aubrey
could
no
longer
support
himself
his
rage
not
finding
vent
had
broken
a
blood-vessel
and
he
was
conveyed
to
bed
this
was
not
mentioned
to
his
sister
who
was
not
present
when
he
entered
as
the
physician
was
afraid
of
agitating
her
the
marriage
was
solemnized
and
the
bride
and
bridegroom
left
london
aubrey's
weakness
increased
the
effusion
of
blood
produced
symptoms
of
the
near
approach
of
death
he
desired
his
sister's
guardians
might
be
called
and
when
the
midnight
hour
had
struck
he
related
composedly
what
the
reader
has
perused--he
died
immediately
after
the
guardians
hastened
to
protect
miss
aubrey
but
when
they
arrived
it
was
too
late
lord
ruthven
had
disappeared
and
aubrey's
sister
had
glutted
the
thirst
of
a
vampyre

byron's

account
of
lord
byron's
residence
c

the
world
was
all
before
him
where
to
choose
his
place
of
rest
and
providence
his
guide
in
sailing
through
the
grecian
archipelago
on
board
one
of
his
majesty's
vessels
in
the
year
1812
we
put
into
the
harbour
of
mitylene
in
the
island
of
that
name
the
beauty
of
this
place
and
the
certain
supply
of
cattle
and
vegetables
always
to
be
had
there
induce
many
british
vessels
to
visit
it--both
men
of
war
and
merchantmen
and
though
it
lies
rather
out
of
the
track
for
ships
bound
to
smyrna
its
bounties
amply
repay
for
the
deviation
of
a
voyage
we
landed
as
usual
at
the
bottom
of
the
bay
and
whilst
the
men
were
employed
in
watering
and
the
purser
bargaining
for
cattle
with
the
natives
the
clergyman
and
myself
took
a
ramble
to
the
cave
called
homer's
school
and
other
places
where
we
had
been
before
on
the
brow
of
mount
ida
a
small
monticule
so
named
we
met
with
and
engaged
a
young
greek
as
our
guide
who
told
us
he
had
come
from
scio
with
an
english
lord
who
left
the
island
four
days
previous
to
our
arrival
in
his
felucca
he
engaged
me
as
a
pilot
said
the
greek
and
would
have
taken
me
with
him
but
i
did
not
choose
to
quit
mitylene
where
i
am
likely
to
get
married
he
was
an
odd
but
a
very
good
man
the
cottage
over
the
hill
facing
the
river
belongs
to
him
and
he
has
left
an
old
man
in
charge
of
it
he
gave
dominick
the
wine-trader
six
hundred
zechines
for
it
about
l250
english
currency
and
has
resided
there
about
fourteen
months
though
not
constantly
for
he
sails
in
his
felucca
very
often
to
the
different
islands
this
account
excited
our
curiosity
very
much
and
we
lost
no
time
in
hastening
to
the
house
where
our
countryman
had
resided
we
were
kindly
received
by
an
old
man
who
conducted
us
over
the
mansion
it
consisted
of
four
apartments
on
the
ground-floor--an
entrance
hall
a
drawing-room
a
sitting
parlour
and
a
bed-room
with
a
spacious
closet
annexed
they
were
all
simply
decorated
plain
green-stained
walls
marble
tables
on
either
side
a
large
myrtle
in
the
centre
and
a
small
fountain
beneath
which
could
be
made
to
play
through
the
branches
by
moving
a
spring
fixed
in
the
side
of
a
small
bronze
venus
in
a
leaning
posture
a
large
couch
or
sofa
completed
the
furniture
in
the
hall
stood
half
a
dozen
english
cane
chairs
and
an
empty
book-case
there
were
no
mirrors
nor
a
single
painting
the
bedchamber
had
merely
a
large
mattress
spread
on
the
floor
with
two
stuffed
cotton
quilts
and
a
pillow--the
common
bed
throughout
greece
in
the
sitting-room
we
observed
a
marble
recess
formerly
the
old
man
told
us
filled
with
books
and
papers
which
were
then
in
a
large
seaman's
chest
in
the
closet
it
was
open
but
we
did
not
think
ourselves
justified
in
examining
the
contents
on
the
tablet
of
the
recess
lay
voltaire's
shakspeare's
boileau's
and
rousseau's
works
complete
volney's
ruins
of
empires
zimmerman
in
the
german
language
klopstock's
messiah
kotzebue's
novels
schiller's
play
of
the
robbers
milton's
paradise
lost
an
italian
edition
printed
at
parma
in
1810
several
small
pamphlets
from
the
greek
press
at
constantinople
much
torn
but
no
english
book
of
any
description
most
of
these
books
were
filled
with
marginal
notes
written
with
a
pencil
in
italian
and
latin
the
messiah
was
literally
scribbled
all
over
and
marked
with
slips
of
paper
on
which
also
were
remarks
the
old
man
said
the
lord
had
been
reading
these
books
the
evening
before
he
sailed
and
forgot
to
place
them
with
the
others
but
said
he
there
they
must
lie
until
his
return
for
he
is
so
particular
that
were
i
to
move
one
thing
without
orders
he
would
frown
upon
me
for
a
week
together
he
is
otherways
very
good
i
once
did
him
a
service
and
i
have
the
produce
of
this
farm
for
the
trouble
of
taking
care
of
it
except
twenty
zechines
which
i
pay
to
an
aged
armenian
who
resides
in
a
small
cottage
in
the
wood
and
whom
the
lord
brought
here
from
adrianople
i
don't
know
for
what
reason
the
appearance
of
the
house
externally
was
pleasing
the
portico
in
front
was
fifty
paces
long
and
fourteen
broad
and
the
fluted
marble
pillars
with
black
plinths
and
fret-work
cornices
as
it
is
now
customary
in
grecian
architecture
were
considerably
higher
than
the
roof
the
roof
surrounded
by
a
light
stone
balustrade
was
covered
by
a
fine
turkey
carpet
beneath
an
awning
of
strong
coarse
linen
most
of
the
house-tops
are
thus
furnished
as
upon
them
the
greeks
pass
their
evenings
in
smoking
drinking
light
wines
such
as
lachryma
christi
eating
fruit
and
enjoying
the
evening
breeze
on
the
left
hand
as
we
entered
the
house
a
small
streamlet
glided
away
grapes
oranges
and
limes
were
clustering
together
on
its
borders
and
under
the
shade
of
two
large
myrtle
bushes
a
marble
seat
with
an
ornamental
wooden
back
was
placed
on
which
we
were
told
the
lord
passed
many
of
his
evenings
and
nights
till
twelve
o'clock
reading
writing
and
talking
to
himself
i
suppose
said
the
old
man
praying
for
he
was
very
devout
and
always
attended
our
church
twice
a
week
besides
sundays
the
view
from
this
seat
was
what
may
be
termed
a
bird's-eye
view
a
line
of
rich
vineyards
led
the
eye
to
mount
calcla
covered
with
olive
and
myrtle
trees
in
bloom
and
on
the
summit
of
which
an
ancient
greek
temple
appeared
in
majestic
decay
a
small
stream
issuing
from
the
ruins
descended
in
broken
cascades
until
it
was
lost
in
the
woods
near
the
mountain's
base
the
sea
smooth
as
glass
and
an
horizon
unshadowed
by
a
single
cloud
terminates
the
view
in
front
and
a
little
on
the
left
through
a
vista
of
lofty
chesnut
and
palm-trees
several
small
islands
were
distinctly
observed
studding
the
light
blue
wave
with
spots
of
emerald
green
i
seldom
enjoyed
a
view
more
than
i
did
this
but
our
enquiries
were
fruitless
as
to
the
name
of
the
person
who
had
resided
in
this
romantic
solitude
none
knew
his
name
but
dominick
his
banker
who
had
gone
to
candia
the
armenian
said
our
conductor
could
tell
but
i
am
sure
he
will
not--and
cannot
you
tell
old
friend
said
i--if
i
can
said
he
i
dare
not
we
had
not
time
to
visit
the
armenian
but
on
our
return
to
the
town
we
learnt
several
particulars
of
the
isolated
lord
he
had
portioned
eight
young
girls
when
he
was
last
upon
the
island
and
even
danced
with
them
at
the
nuptial
feast
he
gave
a
cow
to
one
man
horses
to
others
and
cotton
and
silk
to
the
girls
who
live
by
weaving
these
articles
he
also
bought
a
new
boat
for
a
fisherman
who
had
lost
his
own
in
a
gale
and
he
often
gave
greek
testaments
to
the
poor
children
in
short
he
appeared
to
us
from
all
we
collected
to
have
been
a
very
eccentric
and
benevolent
character
one
circumstance
we
learnt
which
our
old
friend
at
the
cottage
thought
proper
not
to
disclose
he
had
a
most
beautiful
daughter
with
whom
the
lord
was
often
seen
walking
on
the
sea-shore
and
he
had
bought
her
a
piano-forte
and
taught
her
himself
the
use
of
it
such
was
the
information
with
which
we
departed
from
the
peaceful
isle
of
mitylene
our
imaginations
all
on
the
rack
guessing
who
this
rambler
in
greece
could
be
he
had
money
it
was
evident
he
had
philanthropy
of
disposition
and
all
those
eccentricities
which
mark
peculiar
genius
arrived
at
palermo
all
our
doubts
were
dispelled
falling
in
company
with
mr
foster
the
architect
a
pupil
of
wyatt's
who
had
been
travelling
in
egypt
and
greece
the
individual
said
he
about
whom
you
are
so
anxious
is
lord
byron
i
met
him
in
my
travels
on
the
island
of
tenedos
and
i
also
visited
him
at
mitylene
we
had
never
then
heard
of
his
lordship's
fame
as
we
had
been
some
years
from
home
but
childe
harolde
being
put
into
our
hands
we
recognized
the
recluse
of
calcla
in
every
page
deeply
did
we
regret
not
having
been
more
curious
in
our
researches
at
the
cottage
but
we
consoled
ourselves
with
the
idea
of
returning
to
mitylene
on
some
future
day
but
to
me
that
day
will
never
return
i
make
this
statement
believing
it
not
quite
uninteresting
and
in
justice
to
his
lordship's
good
name
which
has
been
grossly
slandered
he
has
been
described
as
of
an
unfeeling
disposition
averse
to
associating
with
human
nature
or
contributing
in
any
way
to
sooth
its
sorrows
or
add
to
its
pleasures
the
fact
is
directly
the
reverse
as
may
be
plainly
gathered
from
these
little
anecdotes
all
the
finer
feelings
of
the
heart
so
elegantly
depicted
in
his
lordship's
poems
seem
to
have
their
seat
in
his
bosom
tenderness
sympathy
and
charity
appear
to
guide
all
his
actions
and
his
courting
the
repose
of
solitude
is
an
additional
reason
for
marking
him
as
a
being
on
whose
heart
religion
hath
set
her
seal
and
over
whose
head
benevolence
hath
thrown
her
mantle
no
man
can
read
the
preceding
pleasing
traits
without
feeling
proud
of
him
as
a
countryman
with
respect
to
his
loves
or
pleasures
i
do
not
assume
a
right
to
give
an
opinion
reports
are
ever
to
be
received
with
caution
particularly
when
directed
against
man's
moral
integrity
and
he
who
dares
justify
himself
before
that
awful
tribunal
where
all
must
appear
alone
may
censure
the
errors
of
a
fellow-mortal
lord
byron's
character
is
worthy
of
his
genius
to
do
good
in
secret
and
shun
the
world's
applause
is
the
surest
testimony
of
a
virtuous
heart
and
self-approving
conscience
