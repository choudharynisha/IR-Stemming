un

i
the
purple
emperor
watched
me
in
silence
i
cast
again
spinning
out
six
feet
more
of
waterproof
silk
and
as
the
line
hissed
through
the
air
far
across
the
pool
i
saw
my
three
flies
fall
on
the
water
like
drifting
thistledown
the
purple
emperor
sneered
you
see
he
said
i
am
right
there
is
not
a
trout
in
brittany
that
will
rise
to
a
tailed
fly
they
do
in
america
i
replied
zut
for
america
observed
the
purple
emperor
and
trout
take
a
tailed
fly
in
england
i
insisted
sharply
now
do
i
care
what
things
or
people
do
in
england
demanded
the
purple
emperor
you
don't
care
for
anything
except
yourself
and
your
wriggling
caterpillars
i
said
more
annoyed
than
i
had
yet
been
the
purple
emperor
sniffed
his
broad
hairless
sunburnt
features
bore
that
obstinate
expression
which
always
irritated
me
perhaps
the
manner
in
which
he
wore
his
hat
intensified
the
irritation
for
the
flapping
brim
rested
on
both
ears
and
the
two
little
velvet
ribbons
which
hung
from
the
silver
buckle
in
front
wiggled
and
fluttered
with
every
trivial
breeze
his
cunning
eyes
and
sharp-pointed
nose
were
out
of
all
keeping
with
his
fat
red
face
when
he
met
my
eye
he
chuckled
i
know
more
about
insects
than
any
man
in
morbihan--or
finistã¨re
either
for
that
matter
he
said
the
red
admiral
knows
as
much
as
you
do
i
retorted
he
doesn't
replied
the
purple
emperor
angrily
and
his
collection
of
butterflies
is
twice
as
large
as
yours
i
added
moving
down
the
stream
to
a
spot
directly
opposite
him
it
is
is
it
sneered
the
purple
emperor
well
let
me
tell
you
monsieur
darrel
in
all
his
collection
he
hasn't
a
specimen
a
single
specimen
of
that
magnificent
butterfly
apatura
iris
commonly
known
as
the
'purple
emperor'
everybody
in
brittany
knows
that
i
said
casting
across
the
sparkling
water
but
just
because
you
happen
to
be
the
only
man
who
ever
captured
a
'purple
emperor'
in
morbihan
it
doesn't
follow
that
you
are
an
authority
on
sea-trout
flies
why
do
you
say
that
a
breton
sea-trout
won't
touch
a
tailed
fly
it's
so
he
replied
why
there
are
plenty
of
may-flies
about
the
stream
let
'em
fly
snarled
the
purple
emperor
you
won't
see
a
trout
touch
'em
my
arm
was
aching
but
i
grasped
my
split
bamboo
more
firmly
and
half
turning
waded
out
into
the
stream
and
began
to
whip
the
ripples
at
the
head
of
the
pool
a
great
green
dragon-fly
came
drifting
by
on
the
summer
breeze
and
hung
a
moment
above
the
pool
glittering
like
an
emerald
there's
a
chance
where
is
your
butterfly
net
i
called
across
the
stream
what
for
that
dragon-fly
i've
got
dozens--anax
junius
drury
characteristic
anal
angle
of
posterior
wings
in
male
round
thorax
marked
with----
that
will
do
i
said
fiercely
can't
i
point
out
an
insect
in
the
air
without
this
burst
of
erudition
can
you
tell
me
in
simple
everyday
french
what
this
little
fly
is--this
one
flitting
over
the
eel
grass
here
beside
me
see
it
has
fallen
on
the
water
huh
sneered
the
purple
emperor
that's
a
linnobia
annulus
what's
that
i
demanded
before
he
could
answer
there
came
a
heavy
splash
in
the
pool
and
the
fly
disappeared
he
he
he
tittered
the
purple
emperor
didn't
i
tell
you
the
fish
knew
their
business
that
was
a
sea-trout
i
hope
you
don't
get
him
he
gathered
up
his
butterfly
net
collecting
box
chloroform
bottle
and
cyanide
jar
then
he
rose
swung
the
box
over
his
shoulder
stuffed
the
poison
bottles
into
the
pockets
of
his
silver-buttoned
velvet
coat
and
lighted
his
pipe
this
latter
operation
was
a
demoralizing
spectacle
for
the
purple
emperor
like
all
breton
peasants
smoked
one
of
those
microscopical
breton
pipes
which
requires
ten
minutes
to
find
ten
minutes
to
fill
ten
minutes
to
light
and
ten
seconds
to
finish
with
true
breton
stolidity
he
went
through
this
solemn
rite
blew
three
puffs
of
smoke
into
the
air
scratched
his
pointed
nose
reflectively
and
waddled
away
calling
back
an
ironical
au
revoir
and
bad
luck
to
all
yankees
i
watched
him
out
of
sight
thinking
sadly
of
the
young
girl
whose
life
he
made
a
hell
upon
earth--lys
trevec
his
niece
she
never
admitted
it
but
we
all
knew
what
the
black-and-blue
marks
meant
on
her
soft
round
arm
and
it
made
me
sick
to
see
the
look
of
fear
come
into
her
eyes
when
the
purple
emperor
waddled
into
the
cafã©
of
the
groix
inn
it
was
commonly
said
that
he
half-starved
her
this
she
denied
marie
joseph
and
'fine
lelocard
had
seen
him
strike
her
the
day
after
the
pardon
of
the
birds
because
she
had
liberated
three
bullfinches
which
he
had
limed
the
day
before
i
asked
lys
if
this
were
true
and
she
refused
to
speak
to
me
for
the
rest
of
the
week
there
was
nothing
to
do
about
it
if
the
purple
emperor
had
not
been
avaricious
i
should
never
have
seen
lys
at
all
but
he
could
not
resist
the
thirty
francs
a
week
which
i
offered
him
and
lys
posed
for
me
all
day
long
happy
as
a
linnet
in
a
pink
thorn
hedge
nevertheless
the
purple
emperor
hated
me
and
constantly
threatened
to
send
lys
back
to
her
dreary
flax-spinning
he
was
suspicious
too
and
when
he
had
gulped
down
the
single
glass
of
cider
which
proves
fatal
to
the
sobriety
of
most
bretons
he
would
pound
the
long
discoloured
oaken
table
and
roar
curses
on
me
on
yves
terrec
and
on
the
red
admiral
we
were
the
three
objects
in
the
world
which
he
most
hated
me
because
i
was
a
foreigner
and
didn't
care
a
rap
for
him
and
his
butterflies
and
the
red
admiral
because
he
was
a
rival
entomologist
he
had
other
reasons
for
hating
terrec
the
red
admiral
a
little
wizened
wretch
with
a
badly
adjusted
glass
eye
and
a
passion
for
brandy
took
his
name
from
a
butterfly
which
predominated
in
his
collection
this
butterfly
commonly
known
to
amateurs
as
the
red
admiral
and
to
entomologists
as
vanessa
atalanta
had
been
the
occasion
of
scandal
among
the
entomologists
of
france
and
brittany
for
the
red
admiral
had
taken
one
of
these
common
insects
dyed
it
a
brilliant
yellow
by
the
aid
of
chemicals
and
palmed
it
off
on
a
credulous
collector
as
a
south
african
species
absolutely
unique
the
fifty
francs
which
he
gained
by
this
rascality
were
however
absorbed
in
a
suit
for
damages
brought
by
the
outraged
amateur
a
month
later
and
when
he
had
sat
in
the
quimperlã©
jail
for
a
month
he
reappeared
in
the
little
village
of
st
gildas
soured
thirsty
and
burning
for
revenge
of
course
we
named
him
the
red
admiral
and
he
accepted
the
name
with
suppressed
fury
the
purple
emperor
on
the
other
hand
had
gained
his
imperial
title
legitimately
for
it
was
an
undisputed
fact
that
the
only
specimen
of
that
beautiful
butterfly
apatura
iris
or
the
purple
emperor
as
it
is
called
by
amateurs--the
only
specimen
that
had
ever
been
taken
in
finistã¨re
or
in
morbihan--was
captured
and
brought
home
alive
by
joseph
marie
gloanec
ever
afterward
to
be
known
as
the
purple
emperor
when
the
capture
of
this
rare
butterfly
became
known
the
red
admiral
nearly
went
crazy
every
day
for
a
week
he
trotted
over
to
the
groix
inn
where
the
purple
emperor
lived
with
his
niece
and
brought
his
microscope
to
bear
on
the
rare
newly
captured
butterfly
in
hopes
of
detecting
a
fraud
but
this
specimen
was
genuine
and
he
leered
through
his
microscope
in
vain
no
chemicals
there
admiral
grinned
the
purple
emperor
and
the
red
admiral
chattered
with
rage
to
the
scientific
world
of
brittany
and
france
the
capture
of
an
apatura
iris
in
morbihan
was
of
great
importance
the
museum
of
quimper
offered
to
purchase
the
butterfly
but
the
purple
emperor
though
a
hoarder
of
gold
was
a
monomaniac
on
butterflies
and
he
jeered
at
the
curator
of
the
museum
from
all
parts
of
brittany
and
france
letters
of
inquiry
and
congratulation
poured
in
upon
him
the
french
academy
of
sciences
awarded
him
a
prize
and
the
paris
entomological
society
made
him
an
honorary
member
being
a
breton
peasant
and
a
more
than
commonly
pig-headed
one
at
that
these
honours
did
not
disturb
his
equanimity
but
when
the
little
hamlet
of
st
gildas
elected
him
mayor
and
as
is
the
custom
in
brittany
under
such
circumstances
he
left
his
thatched
house
to
take
up
an
official
life
in
the
little
groix
inn
his
head
became
completely
turned
to
be
mayor
in
a
village
of
nearly
one
hundred
and
fifty
people
it
was
an
empire
so
he
became
unbearable
drinking
himself
viciously
drunk
every
night
of
his
life
maltreating
his
niece
lys
trevec
like
the
barbarous
old
wretch
that
he
was
and
driving
the
red
admiral
nearly
frantic
with
his
eternal
harping
on
the
capture
of
apatura
iris
of
course
he
refused
to
tell
where
he
had
caught
the
butterfly
the
red
admiral
stalked
his
footsteps
but
in
vain
he
he
he
nagged
the
purple
emperor
cuddling
his
chin
over
a
glass
of
cider
i
saw
you
sneaking
about
the
st
gildas
spinny
yesterday
morning
so
you
think
you
can
find
another
apatura
iris
by
running
after
me
it
won't
do
admiral
it
won't
do
d'ye
see
the
red
admiral
turned
yellow
with
mortification
and
envy
but
the
next
day
he
actually
took
to
his
bed
for
the
purple
emperor
had
brought
home
not
a
butterfly
but
a
live
chrysalis
which
if
successfully
hatched
would
become
a
perfect
specimen
of
the
invaluable
apatura
iris
this
was
the
last
straw
the
red
admiral
shut
himself
up
in
his
little
stone
cottage
and
for
weeks
now
he
had
been
invisible
to
everybody
except
'fine
lelocard
who
carried
him
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
mullet
or
langouste
every
morning
the
withdrawal
of
the
red
admiral
from
the
society
of
st
gildas
excited
first
the
derision
and
finally
the
suspicion
of
the
purple
emperor
what
deviltry
could
he
be
hatching
was
he
experimenting
with
chemicals
again
or
was
he
engaged
in
some
deeper
plot
the
object
of
which
was
to
discredit
the
purple
emperor
roux
the
postman
who
carried
the
mail
on
foot
once
a
day
from
bannalec
a
distance
of
fifteen
miles
each
way
had
brought
several
suspicious
letters
bearing
english
stamps
to
the
red
admiral
and
the
next
day
the
admiral
had
been
observed
at
his
window
grinning
up
into
the
sky
and
rubbing
his
hands
together
a
night
or
two
after
this
apparition
the
postman
left
two
packages
at
the
groix
inn
for
a
moment
while
he
ran
across
the
way
to
drink
a
glass
of
cider
with
me
the
purple
emperor
who
was
roaming
about
the
cafã©
snooping
into
everything
that
did
not
concern
him
came
upon
the
packages
and
examined
the
postmarks
and
addresses
one
of
the
packages
was
square
and
heavy
and
felt
like
a
book
the
other
was
also
square
but
very
light
and
felt
like
a
pasteboard
box
they
were
both
addressed
to
the
red
admiral
and
they
bore
english
stamps
when
roux
the
postman
came
back
the
purple
emperor
tried
to
pump
him
but
the
poor
little
postman
knew
nothing
about
the
contents
of
the
packages
and
after
he
had
taken
them
around
the
corner
to
the
cottage
of
the
red
admiral
the
purple
emperor
ordered
a
glass
of
cider
and
deliberately
fuddled
himself
until
lys
came
in
and
tearfully
supported
him
to
his
room
here
he
became
so
abusive
and
brutal
that
lys
called
to
me
and
i
went
and
settled
the
trouble
without
wasting
any
words
this
also
the
purple
emperor
remembered
and
waited
his
chance
to
get
even
with
me
that
had
happened
a
week
ago
and
until
to-day
he
had
not
deigned
to
speak
to
me
lys
had
posed
for
me
all
the
week
and
to-day
being
saturday
and
i
lazy
we
had
decided
to
take
a
little
relaxation
she
to
visit
and
gossip
with
her
little
black-eyed
friend
yvette
in
the
neighbouring
hamlet
of
st
julien
and
i
to
try
the
appetites
of
the
breton
trout
with
the
contents
of
my
american
fly
book
i
had
thrashed
the
stream
very
conscientiously
for
three
hours
but
not
a
trout
had
risen
to
my
cast
and
i
was
piqued
i
had
begun
to
believe
that
there
were
no
trout
in
the
st
gildas
stream
and
would
probably
have
given
up
had
i
not
seen
the
sea
trout
snap
the
little
fly
which
the
purple
emperor
had
named
so
scientifically
that
set
me
thinking
probably
the
purple
emperor
was
right
for
he
certainly
was
an
expert
in
everything
that
crawled
and
wriggled
in
brittany
so
i
matched
from
my
american
fly
book
the
fly
that
the
sea
trout
had
snapped
up
and
withdrawing
the
cast
of
three
knotted
a
new
leader
to
the
silk
and
slipped
a
fly
on
the
loop
it
was
a
queer
fly
it
was
one
of
those
unnameable
experiments
which
fascinate
anglers
in
sporting
stores
and
which
generally
prove
utterly
useless
moreover
it
was
a
tailed
fly
but
of
course
i
easily
remedied
that
with
a
stroke
of
my
penknife
then
i
was
all
ready
and
i
stepped
out
into
the
hurrying
rapids
and
cast
straight
as
an
arrow
to
the
spot
where
the
sea
trout
had
risen
lightly
as
a
plume
the
fly
settled
on
the
bosom
of
the
pool
then
came
a
startling
splash
a
gleam
of
silver
and
the
line
tightened
from
the
vibrating
rod-tip
to
the
shrieking
reel
almost
instantly
i
checked
the
fish
and
as
he
floundered
for
a
moment
making
the
water
boil
along
his
glittering
sides
i
sprang
to
the
bank
again
for
i
saw
that
the
fish
was
a
heavy
one
and
i
should
probably
be
in
for
a
long
run
down
the
stream
the
five-ounce
rod
swept
in
a
splendid
circle
quivering
under
the
strain
oh
for
a
gaff-hook
i
cried
aloud
for
i
was
now
firmly
convinced
that
i
had
a
salmon
to
deal
with
and
no
sea
trout
at
all
then
as
i
stood
bringing
every
ounce
to
bear
on
the
sulking
fish
a
lithe
slender
girl
came
hurriedly
along
the
opposite
bank
calling
out
to
me
by
name
why
lys
i
said
glancing
up
for
a
second
i
thought
you
were
at
st
julien
with
yvette
yvette
has
gone
to
bannalec
i
went
home
and
found
an
awful
fight
going
on
at
the
groix
inn
and
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
came
to
tell
you
the
fish
dashed
off
at
that
moment
carrying
all
the
line
my
reel
held
and
i
was
compelled
to
follow
him
at
a
jump
lys
active
and
graceful
as
a
young
deer
in
spite
of
her
pont-aven
sabots
followed
along
the
opposite
bank
until
the
fish
settled
in
a
deep
pool
shook
the
line
savagely
once
or
twice
and
then
relapsed
into
the
sulks
fight
at
the
groix
inn
i
called
across
the
water
what
fight
not
exactly
fight
quavered
lys
but
the
red
admiral
has
come
out
of
his
house
at
last
and
he
and
my
uncle
are
drinking
together
and
disputing
about
butterflies
i
never
saw
my
uncle
so
angry
and
the
red
admiral
is
sneering
and
grinning
oh
it
is
almost
wicked
to
see
such
a
face
but
lys
i
said
scarcely
able
to
repress
a
smile
your
uncle
and
the
red
admiral
are
always
quarrelling
and
drinking
i
know--oh
dear
me--but
this
is
different
monsieur
darrel
the
red
admiral
has
grown
old
and
fierce
since
he
shut
himself
up
three
weeks
ago
and--oh
dear
i
never
saw
such
a
look
in
my
uncle's
eyes
before
he
seemed
insane
with
fury
his
eyes--i
can't
speak
of
it--and
then
terrec
came
in
oh
i
said
more
gravely
that
was
unfortunate
what
did
the
red
admiral
say
to
his
son
lys
sat
down
on
a
rock
among
the
ferns
and
gave
me
a
mutinous
glance
from
her
blue
eyes
yves
terrec
loafer
poacher
and
son
of
louis
jean
terrec
otherwise
the
red
admiral
had
been
kicked
out
by
his
father
and
had
also
been
forbidden
the
village
by
the
purple
emperor
in
his
majestic
capacity
of
mayor
twice
the
young
ruffian
had
returned
once
to
rifle
the
bedroom
of
the
purple
emperor--an
unsuccessful
enterprise--and
another
time
to
rob
his
own
father
he
succeeded
in
the
latter
attempt
but
was
never
caught
although
he
was
frequently
seen
roving
about
the
forests
and
moors
with
his
gun
he
openly
menaced
the
purple
emperor
vowed
that
he
would
marry
lys
in
spite
of
all
the
gendarmes
in
quimperlã©
and
these
same
gendarmes
he
led
many
a
long
chase
through
brier-filled
swamps
and
over
miles
of
yellow
gorse
what
he
did
to
the
purple
emperor--what
he
intended
to
do--disquieted
me
but
little
but
i
worried
over
his
threat
concerning
lys
during
the
last
three
months
this
had
bothered
me
a
great
deal
for
when
lys
came
to
st
gildas
from
the
convent
the
first
thing
she
captured
was
my
heart
for
a
long
time
i
had
refused
to
believe
that
any
tie
of
blood
linked
this
dainty
blue-eyed
creature
with
the
purple
emperor
although
she
dressed
in
the
velvet-laced
bodice
and
blue
petticoat
of
finistã¨re
and
wore
the
bewitching
white
coiffe
of
st
gildas
it
seemed
like
a
pretty
masquerade
to
me
she
was
as
sweet
and
as
gently
bred
as
many
a
maiden
of
the
noble
faubourg
who
danced
with
her
cousins
at
a
louis
xv
fãªte
champãªtre
so
when
lys
said
that
yves
terrec
had
returned
openly
to
st
gildas
i
felt
that
i
had
better
be
there
also
what
did
terrec
say
lys
i
asked
watching
the
line
vibrating
above
the
placid
pool
the
wild
rose
colour
crept
into
her
cheeks
oh
she
answered
with
a
little
toss
of
her
chin
you
know
what
he
always
says
that
he
will
carry
you
away
yes
in
spite
of
the
purple
emperor
the
red
admiral
and
the
gendarmes
yes
and
what
do
you
say
lys
i
oh
nothing
then
let
me
say
it
for
you
lys
looked
at
her
delicate
pointed
sabots
the
sabots
from
pont-aven
made
to
order
they
fitted
her
little
foot
they
were
her
only
luxury
will
you
let
me
answer
for
you
lys
i
asked
you
monsieur
darrel
yes
will
you
let
me
give
him
his
answer
mon
dieu
why
should
you
concern
yourself
monsieur
darrel
the
fish
lay
very
quiet
but
the
rod
in
my
hand
trembled
because
i
love
you
lys
the
wild
rose
colour
in
her
cheeks
deepened
she
gave
a
gentle
gasp
then
hid
her
curly
head
in
her
hands
i
love
you
lys
do
you
know
what
you
say
she
stammered
yes
i
love
you
she
raised
her
sweet
face
and
looked
at
me
across
the
pool
i
love
you
she
said
while
the
tears
stood
like
stars
in
her
eyes
shall
i
come
over
the
brook
to
you
ii
that
night
yves
terrec
left
the
village
of
st
gildas
vowing
vengeance
against
his
father
who
refused
him
shelter
i
can
see
him
now
standing
in
the
road
his
bare
legs
rising
like
pillars
of
bronze
from
his
straw-stuffed
sabots
his
short
velvet
jacket
torn
and
soiled
by
exposure
and
dissipation
and
his
eyes
fierce
roving
bloodshot--while
the
red
admiral
squeaked
curses
on
him
and
hobbled
away
into
his
little
stone
cottage
i
will
not
forget
you
cried
yves
terrec
and
stretched
out
his
hand
toward
his
father
with
a
terrible
gesture
then
he
whipped
his
gun
to
his
cheek
and
took
a
short
step
forward
but
i
caught
him
by
the
throat
before
he
could
fire
and
a
second
later
we
were
rolling
in
the
dust
of
the
bannalec
road
i
had
to
hit
him
a
heavy
blow
behind
the
ear
before
he
would
let
go
and
then
rising
and
shaking
myself
i
dashed
his
muzzle-loading
fowling
piece
to
bits
against
a
wall
and
threw
his
knife
into
the
river
the
purple
emperor
was
looking
on
with
a
queer
light
in
his
eyes
it
was
plain
that
he
was
sorry
terrec
had
not
choked
me
to
death
he
would
have
killed
his
father
i
said
as
i
passed
him
going
toward
the
groix
inn
that's
his
business
snarled
the
purple
emperor
there
was
a
deadly
light
in
his
eyes
for
a
moment
i
thought
he
was
going
to
attack
me
but
he
was
merely
viciously
drunk
so
i
shoved
him
out
of
my
way
and
went
to
bed
tired
and
disgusted
the
worst
of
it
was
i
couldn't
sleep
for
i
feared
that
the
purple
emperor
might
begin
to
abuse
lys
i
lay
restlessly
tossing
among
the
sheets
until
i
could
stay
there
no
longer
i
did
not
dress
entirely
i
merely
slipped
on
a
pair
of
chaussons
and
sabots
a
pair
of
knickerbockers
a
jersey
and
a
cap
then
loosely
tying
a
handkerchief
about
my
throat
i
went
down
the
worm-eaten
stairs
and
out
into
the
moonlit
road
there
was
a
candle
flaring
in
the
purple
emperor's
window
but
i
could
not
see
him
he's
probably
dead
drunk
i
thought
and
looked
up
at
the
window
where
three
years
before
i
had
first
seen
lys
asleep
thank
heaven
i
muttered
and
wandered
out
along
the
road
passing
the
small
cottage
of
the
red
admiral
i
saw
that
it
was
dark
but
the
door
was
open
i
stepped
inside
the
hedge
to
shut
it
thinking
in
case
yves
terrec
should
be
roving
about
his
father
would
lose
whatever
he
had
left
then
after
fastening
the
door
with
a
stone
i
wandered
on
through
the
dazzling
breton
moonlight
a
nightingale
was
singing
in
a
willow
swamp
below
and
from
the
edge
of
the
mere
among
the
tall
swamp
grasses
myriads
of
frogs
chanted
a
bass
chorus
when
i
returned
the
eastern
sky
was
beginning
to
lighten
and
across
the
meadows
on
the
cliffs
outlined
against
the
paling
horizon
i
saw
a
seaweed
gatherer
going
to
his
work
among
the
curling
breakers
on
the
coast
his
long
rake
was
balanced
on
his
shoulder
and
the
sea
wind
carried
his
song
across
the
meadows
to
me
st
gildas
st
gildas
pray
for
us
shelter
us
us
who
toil
in
the
sea
passing
the
shrine
at
the
entrance
of
the
village
i
took
off
my
cap
and
knelt
in
prayer
to
our
lady
of
faã¶uet
and
if
i
neglected
myself
in
that
prayer
surely
i
believed
our
lady
of
faã¶uet
would
be
kinder
to
lys
it
is
said
that
the
shrine
casts
white
shadows
i
looked
but
saw
only
the
moonlight
then
very
peacefully
i
went
to
bed
again
and
was
only
awakened
by
the
clank
of
sabres
and
the
trample
of
horses
in
the
road
below
my
window
good
gracious
i
thought
it
must
be
eleven
o'clock
for
there
are
the
gendarmes
from
quimperlã©
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
only
half-past
eight
and
as
the
gendarmes
made
their
rounds
every
thursday
at
eleven
i
wondered
what
had
brought
them
out
so
early
to
st
gildas
of
course
i
grumbled
rubbing
my
eyes
they
are
after
terrec
and
i
jumped
into
my
limited
bath
before
i
was
completely
dressed
i
heard
a
timid
knock
and
opening
my
door
razor
in
hand
stood
astonished
and
silent
lys
her
blue
eyes
wide
with
terror
leaned
on
the
threshold
my
darling
i
cried
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
but
she
only
clung
to
me
panting
like
a
wounded
sea
gull
at
last
when
i
drew
her
into
the
room
and
raised
her
face
to
mine
she
spoke
in
a
heart-breaking
voice
oh
dick
they
are
going
to
arrest
you
but
i
will
die
before
i
believe
one
word
of
what
they
say
no
don't
ask
me
and
she
began
to
sob
desperately
when
i
found
that
something
really
serious
was
the
matter
i
flung
on
my
coat
and
cap
and
slipping
one
arm
about
her
waist
went
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
road
four
gendarmes
sat
on
their
horses
in
front
of
the
cafã©
door
beyond
them
the
entire
population
of
st
gildas
gaped
ten
deep
hello
durand
i
said
to
the
brigadier
what
the
devil
is
this
i
hear
about
arresting
me
it's
true
mon
ami
replied
durand
with
sepulchral
sympathy
i
looked
him
over
from
the
tip
of
his
spurred
boots
to
his
sulphur-yellow
sabre
belt
then
upward
button
by
button
to
his
disconcerted
face
what
for
i
said
scornfully
don't
try
any
cheap
sleuth
work
on
me
speak
up
man
what's
the
trouble
the
purple
emperor
who
sat
in
the
doorway
staring
at
me
started
to
speak
but
thought
better
of
it
and
got
up
and
went
into
the
house
the
gendarmes
rolled
their
eyes
mysteriously
and
looked
wise
come
durand
i
said
impatiently
what's
the
charge
murder
he
said
in
a
faint
voice
what
i
cried
incredulously
nonsense
do
i
look
like
a
murderer
get
off
your
horse
you
stupid
and
tell
me
who's
murdered
durand
got
down
looking
very
silly
and
came
up
to
me
offering
his
hand
with
a
propitiatory
grin
it
was
the
purple
emperor
who
denounced
you
see
they
found
your
handkerchief
at
his
door----
whose
door
for
heaven's
sake
i
cried
why
the
red
admiral's
the
red
admiral's
what
has
he
done
nothing--he's
only
been
murdered
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
senses
although
they
took
me
over
to
the
little
stone
cottage
and
pointed
out
the
blood-spattered
room
but
the
horror
of
the
thing
was
that
the
corpse
of
the
murdered
man
had
disappeared
and
there
only
remained
a
nauseating
lake
of
blood
on
the
stone
floor
in
the
centre
of
which
lay
a
human
hand
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
whom
the
hand
belonged
for
everybody
who
had
ever
seen
the
red
admiral
knew
that
the
shrivelled
bit
of
flesh
which
lay
in
the
thickening
blood
was
the
hand
of
the
red
admiral
to
me
it
looked
like
the
severed
claw
of
some
gigantic
bird
well
i
said
there's
been
murder
committed
why
don't
you
do
something
what
asked
durand
i
don't
know
send
for
the
commissaire
he's
at
quimperlã©
i
telegraphed
then
send
for
a
doctor
and
find
out
how
long
this
blood
has
been
coagulating
the
chemist
from
quimperlã©
is
here
he's
a
doctor
what
does
he
say
he
says
that
he
doesn't
know
and
who
are
you
going
to
arrest
i
inquired
turning
away
from
the
spectacle
on
the
floor
i
don't
know
said
the
brigadier
solemnly
you
are
denounced
by
the
purple
emperor
because
he
found
your
handkerchief
at
the
door
when
he
went
out
this
morning
just
like
a
pig-headed
breton
i
exclaimed
thoroughly
angry
did
he
not
mention
yves
terrec
no
of
course
not
i
said
he
overlooked
the
fact
that
terrec
tried
to
shoot
his
father
last
night
and
that
i
took
away
his
gun
all
that
counts
for
nothing
when
he
finds
my
handkerchief
at
the
murdered
man's
door
come
into
the
cafã©
said
durand
much
disturbed
we
can
talk
it
over
there
of
course
monsieur
darrel
i
have
never
had
the
faintest
idea
that
you
were
the
murderer
the
four
gendarmes
and
i
walked
across
the
road
to
the
groix
inn
and
entered
the
cafã©
it
was
crowded
with
bretons
smoking
drinking
and
jabbering
in
half
a
dozen
dialects
all
equally
unsatisfactory
to
a
civilized
ear
and
i
pushed
through
the
crowd
to
where
little
max
fortin
the
chemist
of
quimperlã©
stood
smoking
a
vile
cigar
this
is
a
bad
business
he
said
shaking
hands
and
offering
me
the
mate
to
his
cigar
which
i
politely
declined
now
monsieur
fortin
i
said
it
appears
that
the
purple
emperor
found
my
handkerchief
near
the
murdered
man's
door
this
morning
and
so
he
concludes--here
i
glared
at
the
purple
emperor--that
i
am
the
assassin
i
will
now
ask
him
a
question
and
turning
on
him
suddenly
i
shouted
what
were
you
doing
at
the
red
admiral's
door
the
purple
emperor
started
and
turned
pale
and
i
pointed
at
him
triumphantly
see
what
a
sudden
question
will
do
look
how
embarrassed
he
is
and
yet
i
do
not
charge
him
with
murder
and
i
tell
you
gentlemen
that
man
there
knows
as
well
as
i
do
who
was
the
murderer
of
the
red
admiral
i
don't
bawled
the
purple
emperor
you
do
i
said
it
was
yves
terrec
i
don't
believe
it
he
said
obstinately
dropping
his
voice
of
course
not
being
pig-headed
i
am
not
pig-headed
he
roared
again
but
i
am
mayor
of
st
gildas
and
i
do
not
believe
that
yves
terrec
killed
his
father
you
saw
him
try
to
kill
him
last
night
the
mayor
grunted
and
you
saw
what
i
did
he
grunted
again
and
i
went
on
you
heard
yves
terrec
threaten
to
kill
his
father
you
heard
him
curse
the
red
admiral
and
swear
to
kill
him
now
the
father
is
murdered
and
his
body
is
gone
and
your
handkerchief
sneered
the
purple
emperor
i
dropped
it
of
course
and
the
seaweed
gatherer
who
saw
you
last
night
lurking
about
the
red
admiral's
cottage
grinned
the
purple
emperor
i
was
startled
at
the
man's
malice
that
will
do
i
said
it
is
perfectly
true
that
i
was
walking
on
the
bannalec
road
last
night
and
that
i
stopped
to
close
the
red
admiral's
door
which
was
ajar
although
his
light
was
not
burning
after
that
i
went
up
the
road
to
the
dinez
woods
and
then
walked
over
by
st
julien
whence
i
saw
the
seaweed
gatherer
on
the
cliffs
he
was
near
enough
for
me
to
hear
what
he
sang
what
of
that
what
did
you
do
then
then
i
stopped
at
the
shrine
and
said
a
prayer
and
then
i
went
to
bed
and
slept
until
brigadier
durand's
gendarmes
awoke
me
with
their
clatter
now
monsieur
darrel
said
the
purple
emperor
lifting
a
fat
finger
and
shooting
a
wicked
glance
at
me
now
monsieur
darrel
which
did
you
wear
last
night
on
your
midnight
stroll--sabots
or
shoes
i
thought
a
moment
shoes--no
sabots
i
just
slipped
on
my
chaussons
and
went
out
in
my
sabots
which
was
it
shoes
or
sabots
snarled
the
purple
emperor
sabots
you
fool
are
these
your
sabots
he
asked
lifting
up
a
wooden
shoe
with
my
initials
cut
on
the
instep
yes
i
replied
then
how
did
this
blood
come
on
the
other
one
he
shouted
and
held
up
a
sabot
the
mate
to
the
first
on
which
a
drop
of
blood
had
spattered
i
haven't
the
least
idea
i
said
calmly
but
my
heart
was
beating
very
fast
and
i
was
furiously
angry
you
blockhead
i
said
controlling
my
rage
i'll
make
you
pay
for
this
when
they
catch
yves
terrec
and
convict
him
brigadier
durand
do
your
duty
if
you
think
i
am
under
suspicion
arrest
me
but
grant
me
one
favour
put
me
in
the
red
admiral's
cottage
and
i'll
see
whether
i
can't
find
some
clew
that
you
have
overlooked
of
course
i
won't
disturb
anything
until
the
commissaire
arrives
bah
you
all
make
me
very
ill
he's
hardened
observed
the
purple
emperor
wagging
his
head
what
motive
had
i
to
kill
the
red
admiral
i
asked
them
all
scornfully
and
they
all
cried
none
yves
terrec
is
the
man
passing
out
of
the
door
i
swung
around
and
shook
my
finger
at
the
purple
emperor
oh
i'll
make
you
dance
for
this
my
friend
i
said
and
i
followed
brigadier
durand
across
the
street
to
the
cottage
of
the
murdered
man
iii
they
took
me
at
my
word
and
placed
a
gendarme
with
a
bared
sabre
at
the
gateway
by
the
hedge
give
me
your
parole
said
poor
durand
and
i
will
let
you
go
where
you
wish
but
i
refused
and
began
prowling
about
the
cottage
looking
for
clews
i
found
lots
of
things
that
some
people
would
have
considered
most
important
such
as
ashes
from
the
red
admiral's
pipe
footprints
in
a
dusty
vegetable
bin
bottles
smelling
of
pouldu
cider
and
dust--oh
lots
of
dust--but
i
was
not
an
expert
only
a
stupid
everyday
amateur
so
i
defaced
the
footprints
with
my
thick
shooting
boots
and
i
declined
to
examine
the
pipe
ashes
through
a
microscope
although
the
red
admiral's
microscope
stood
on
the
table
close
at
hand
at
last
i
found
what
i
had
been
looking
for
some
long
wisps
of
straw
curiously
depressed
and
flattened
in
the
middle
and
i
was
certain
i
had
found
the
evidence
that
would
settle
yves
terrec
for
the
rest
of
his
life
it
was
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
the
straws
were
sabot
straws
flattened
where
the
foot
had
pressed
them
and
sticking
straight
out
where
they
projected
beyond
the
sabot
now
nobody
in
st
gildas
used
straw
in
sabots
except
a
fisherman
who
lived
near
st
julien
and
the
straw
in
his
sabots
was
ordinary
yellow
wheat
straw
this
straw
or
rather
these
straws
were
from
the
stalks
of
the
red
wheat
which
only
grows
inland
and
which
everybody
in
st
gildas
knew
yves
terrec
wore
in
his
sabots
i
was
perfectly
satisfied
and
when
three
hours
later
a
hoarse
shouting
from
the
bannalec
road
brought
me
to
the
window
i
was
not
surprised
to
see
yves
terrec
bloody
dishevelled
hatless
with
his
strong
arms
bound
behind
him
walking
with
bent
head
between
two
mounted
gendarmes
the
crowd
around
him
swelled
every
minute
crying
parricide
parricide
death
to
the
murderer
as
he
passed
my
window
i
saw
great
clots
of
mud
on
his
dusty
sabots
from
the
heels
of
which
projected
wisps
of
red
wheat
straw
then
i
walked
back
into
the
red
admiral's
study
determined
to
find
what
the
microscope
would
show
on
the
wheat
straws
i
examined
each
one
very
carefully
and
then
my
eyes
aching
i
rested
my
chin
on
my
hand
and
leaned
back
in
the
chair
i
had
not
been
as
fortunate
as
some
detectives
for
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
straws
had
ever
been
used
in
a
sabot
at
all
furthermore
directly
across
the
hallway
stood
a
carved
breton
chest
and
now
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
from
beneath
the
closed
lid
dozens
of
similar
red
wheat
straws
projected
bent
exactly
as
mine
were
bent
by
the
weight
of
the
lid
i
yawned
in
disgust
it
was
apparent
that
i
was
not
cut
out
for
a
detective
and
i
bitterly
pondered
over
the
difference
between
clews
in
real
life
and
clews
in
a
detective
story
after
a
while
i
rose
walked
over
to
the
chest
and
opened
the
lid
the
interior
was
wadded
with
the
red
wheat
straws
and
on
this
wadding
lay
two
curious
glass
jars
two
or
three
small
vials
several
empty
bottles
labelled
chloroform
a
collecting
jar
of
cyanide
of
potassium
and
a
book
in
a
farther
corner
of
the
chest
were
some
letters
bearing
english
stamps
and
also
the
torn
coverings
of
two
parcels
all
from
england
and
all
directed
to
the
red
admiral
under
his
proper
name
of
sieur
louis
jean
terrec
st
gildas
par
moã«lan

all
these
traps
i
carried
over
to
the
desk
shut
the
lid
of
the
chest
and
sat
down
to
read
the
letters
they
were
written
in
commercial

when
i
had
finished
this
letter
i
folded
it
up
and
put
it
into
my
pocket
with
the
others
then
i
opened
blowzer's
valuable
work
how
to
catch
british
butterflies
and
turned
to
page
630
now
although
the
red
admiral
could
only
have
acquired
the
book
very
recently
and
although
all
the
other
pages
were
perfectly
clean
this
particular
page
was
thumbed
black
and
heavy
pencil
marks
inclosed
a
paragraph
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
this
is
the
paragraph
professor
schweineri
says
'of
the
two
old
methods
used
by
collectors
for
the
capture
of
the
swift-winged
high-flying
apatura
iris
or
purple
emperor
the
first
which
was
using
a
long-handled
net
proved
successful
once
in
a
thousand
times
and
the
second
the
placing
of
bait
upon
the
ground
such
as
decayed
meat
dead
cats
rats
etc
was
not
only
disagreeable
even
for
an
enthusiastic
collector
but
also
very
uncertain
once
in
five
hundred
times
would
the
splendid
butterfly
leave
the
tops
of
his
favourite
oak
trees
to
circle
about
the
fetid
bait
offered
i
have
found
cythyl
a
perfectly
sure
bait
to
draw
this
beautiful
butterfly
to
the
ground
where
it
can
be
easily
captured
an
ounce
of
cythyl
placed
in
a
yellow
saucer
under
an
oak
tree
will
draw
to
it
every
apatura
iris
within
a
radius
of
twenty
miles
so
if
any
collector
who
possesses
a
little
cythyl
even
though
it
be
in
a
sealed
bottle
in
his
pocket--if
such
a
collector
does
not
find
a
single
apatura
iris
fluttering
close
about
him
within
an
hour
let
him
be
satisfied
that
the
apatura
iris
does
not
inhabit
his
country'
when
i
had
finished
reading
this
note
i
sat
for
a
long
while
thinking
hard
then
i
examined
the
two
jars
they
were
labelled
cythyl
one
was
full
the
other
nearly
full
the
rest
must
be
on
the
corpse
of
the
red
admiral
i
thought
no
matter
if
it
is
in
a
corked
bottle----
i
took
all
the
things
back
to
the
chest
laid
them
carefully
on
the
straw
and
closed
the
lid
the
gendarme
sentinel
at
the
gate
saluted
me
respectfully
as
i
crossed
over
to
the
groix
inn
the
inn
was
surrounded
by
an
excited
crowd
and
the
hallway
was
choked
with
gendarmes
and
peasants
on
every
side
they
greeted
me
cordially
announcing
that
the
real
murderer
was
caught
but
i
pushed
by
them
without
a
word
and
ran
upstairs
to
find
lys
she
opened
her
door
when
i
knocked
and
threw
both
arms
about
my
neck
i
took
her
to
my
breast
and
kissed
her
after
a
moment
i
asked
her
if
she
would
obey
me
no
matter
what
i
commanded
and
she
said
she
would
with
a
proud
humility
that
touched
me
then
go
at
once
to
yvette
in
st
julien
i
said
ask
her
to
harness
the
dog-cart
and
drive
you
to
the
convent
in
quimperlã©
wait
for
me
there
will
you
do
this
without
questioning
me
my
darling
she
raised
her
face
to
mine
kiss
me
she
said
innocently
the
next
moment
she
had
vanished
i
walked
deliberately
into
the
purple
emperor's
room
and
peered
into
the
gauze-covered
box
which
had
held
the
chrysalis
of
apatura
iris
it
was
as
i
expected
the
chrysalis
was
empty
and
transparent
and
a
great
crack
ran
down
the
middle
of
its
back
but
on
the
netting
inside
the
box
a
magnificent
butterfly
slowly
waved
its
burnished
purple
wings
for
the
chrysalis
had
given
up
its
silent
tenant
the
butterfly
symbol
of
immortality
then
a
great
fear
fell
upon
me
i
know
now
that
it
was
the
fear
of
the
black
priest
but
neither
then
nor
for
years
after
did
i
know
that
the
black
priest
had
ever
lived
on
earth
as
i
bent
over
the
box
i
heard
a
confused
murmur
outside
the
house
which
ended
in
a
furious
shout
of
parricide
and
i
heard
the
gendarmes
ride
away
behind
a
wagon
which
rattled
sharply
on
the
flinty
highway
i
went
to
the
window
in
the
wagon
sat
yves
terrec
bound
and
wild-eyed
two
gendarmes
at
either
side
of
him
and
all
around
the
wagon
rode
mounted
gendarmes
whose
bared
sabres
scarcely
kept
the
crowd
away
parricide
they
howled
let
him
die
i
stepped
back
and
opened
the
gauze-covered
box
very
gently
but
firmly
i
took
the
splendid
butterfly
by
its
closed
fore
wings
and
lifted
it
unharmed
between
my
thumb
and
forefinger
then
holding
it
concealed
behind
my
back
i
went
down
into
the
cafã©
of
all
the
crowd
that
had
filled
it
shouting
for
the
death
of
yves
terrec
only
three
persons
remained
seated
in
front
of
the
huge
empty
fireplace
they
were
the
brigadier
durand
max
fortin
the
chemist
of
quimperlã©
and
the
purple
emperor
the
latter
looked
abashed
when
i
entered
but
i
paid
no
attention
to
him
and
walked
straight
to
the
chemist
monsieur
fortin
i
said
do
you
know
much
about
hydrocarbons
they
are
my
specialty
he
said
astonished
have
you
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
cythyl
schweineri's
cythyl
oh
yes
we
use
it
in
perfumery
good
i
said
has
it
an
odour
no--and
yes
one
is
always
aware
of
its
presence
but
really
nobody
can
affirm
it
has
an
odour
it
is
curious
he
continued
looking
at
me
it
is
very
curious
you
should
have
asked
me
that
for
all
day
i
have
been
imagining
i
detected
the
presence
of
cythyl
do
you
imagine
so
now
i
asked
yes
more
than
ever
i
sprang
to
the
front
door
and
tossed
out
the
butterfly
the
splendid
creature
beat
the
air
for
a
moment
flitted
uncertainly
hither
and
thither
and
then
to
my
astonishment
sailed
majestically
back
into
the
cafã©
and
alighted
on
the
hearthstone
for
a
moment
i
was
nonplussed
but
when
my
eyes
rested
on
the
purple
emperor
i
comprehended
in
a
flash
lift
that
hearthstone
i
cried
to
the
brigadier
durand
pry
it
up
with
your
scabbard
the
purple
emperor
suddenly
fell
forward
in
his
chair
his
face
ghastly
white
his
jaw
loose
with
terror
what
is
cythyl
i
shouted
seizing
him
by
the
arm
but
he
plunged
heavily
from
his
chair
face
downward
on
the
floor
and
at
the
same
moment
a
cry
from
the
chemist
made
me
turn
there
stood
the
brigadier
durand
one
hand
supporting
the
hearthstone
one
hand
raised
in
horror
there
stood
max
fortin
the
chemist
rigid
with
excitement
and
below
in
the
hollow
bed
where
the
hearthstone
had
rested
lay
a
crushed
mass
of
bleeding
human
flesh
from
the
midst
of
which
stared
a
cheap
glass
eye
i
seized
the
purple
emperor
and
dragged
him
to
his
feet
look
i
cried
look
at
your
old
friend
the
red
admiral
but
he
only
smiled
in
a
vacant
way
and
rolled
his
head
muttering
bait
for
butterflies
cythyl
oh
no
no
no
you
can't
do
it
admiral
d'ye
see
i
alone
own
the
purple
emperor
i
alone
am
the
purple
emperor
and
the
same
carriage
that
bore
me
to
quimperlã©
to
claim
my
bride
carried
him
to
quimper
gagged
and
bound
a
foaming
howling
lunatic





this
then
is
the
story
of
the
purple
emperor
i
might
tell
you
a
pleasanter
story
if
i
chose
but
concerning
the
fish
that
i
had
hold
of
whether
it
was
a
salmon
a
grilse
or
a
sea
trout
i
may
not
say
because
i
have
promised
lys
and
she
has
promised
me
that
no
power
on
earth
shall
wring
from
our
lips
the
mortifying
confession
that
the
fish
escaped
pompe
funãˆbre
a
wind-swept
sky
the
waste
of
moorland
stretching
to
the
west
the
sea
low
moaning
in
a
strange
unrest--
a
seagull's
cry
washed
by
the
tide
the
rocks
lie
sullen
in
the
waning
light
the
foam
breaks
in
long
strips
of
hungry
white
dissatisfied
bateman
pompe
funãˆbre
in
the
days
when
the
keepers
of
the
house
shall
tremble
when
i
first
saw
the
sexton
he
was
standing
motionless
behind
a
stone
presently
he
moved
on
again
pausing
at
times
and
turning
right
and
left
with
that
nervous
jerky
motion
that
always
chills
me
his
path
lay
across
the
blighted
moss
and
withered
leaves
scattered
in
moist
layers
along
the
bank
of
the
little
brown
stream
and
i
wondering
what
his
errand
might
be
followed
passing
silently
over
the
rotting
forest
mould
once
or
twice
he
heard
me
for
i
saw
him
stop
short
a
blot
of
black
and
orange
in
the
sombre
woods
but
he
always
started
on
again
hurrying
at
times
as
though
the
dead
might
grow
impatient
for
the
sexton
that
i
followed
through
the
november
forest
was
one
of
those
small
creatures
that
god
has
sent
to
bury
little
things
that
die
alone
in
the
world
undertaker
sexton
mute
and
gravedigger
in
one
this
thing
robed
in
black
and
orange
buries
all
things
that
die
unheeded
by
the
world
and
so
they
call
it--this
little
beetle
in
black
and
orange--the
sexton
how
he
hurried
i
looked
up
into
the
gray
sky
where
ashen
branches
interlaced
swayed
in
unfelt
winds
and
i
heard
the
dry
leaves
rattle
in
the
tree
tops
and
the
thud
of
acorns
on
the
mould
a
sombre
bird
peered
at
me
from
a
heap
of
brush
then
ran
pattering
over
the
leaves
the
sexton
had
reached
a
bit
of
broken
ground
and
was
scuffling
over
sticks
and
gulleys
toward
a
brown
tuft
of
withered
grass
above
i
dared
not
help
him
besides
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
touch
him
he
was
so
horribly
absorbed
in
his
errand
i
halted
for
a
moment
the
eagerness
of
this
live
creature
to
find
his
dead
and
handle
it
the
odour
of
death
and
decay
in
this
little
forest
world
where
i
had
waited
for
spring
when
lys
moved
among
the
flowering
gorse
singing
like
a
throstle
in
the
wind--all
this
troubled
me
and
i
lagged
behind
the
sexton
scrambled
over
the
dead
grass
raising
his
seared
eyes
at
every
wave
of
wind
the
wind
brought
sadness
with
it
the
scent
of
lifeless
trees
the
vague
rustle
of
gorse
buds
yellow
and
dry
as
paper
flowers
along
the
stream
rotting
water
plants
scorched
and
frost-blighted
lay
massed
above
the
mud
i
saw
their
pallid
stems
swaying
like
worms
in
the
listless
current
the
sexton
had
reached
a
mouldering
stump
and
now
he
seemed
undecided
i
sat
down
on
a
fallen
tree
moist
and
bleached
that
crumbled
under
my
touch
leaving
a
stale
odour
in
the
air
overhead
a
crow
rose
heavily
and
flapped
out
into
the
moorland
the
wind
rattled
the
stark
blackthorns
a
single
drop
of
rain
touched
my
cheek
i
looked
into
the
stream
for
some
sign
of
life
there
was
nothing
except
a
shapeless
creature
that
might
have
been
a
blindworm
lying
belly
upward
on
the
mud
bottom
i
touched
it
with
a
stick
it
was
stiff
and
dead
the
wind
among
the
sham
paperlike
gorse
buds
filled
the
woods
with
a
silken
rustle
i
put
out
my
hand
and
touched
a
yellow
blossom
it
felt
like
an
immortelle
on
a
funeral
pillow
the
sexton
had
moved
on
again
something
perhaps
a
musty
spider's
web
had
stuck
to
one
leg
and
he
dragged
it
as
he
laboured
on
through
the
wood
some
little
field
mouse
torn
by
weasel
or
kestrel
some
crushed
mole
some
tiny
dead
pile
of
fur
or
feather
lay
not
far
off
stricken
by
god
or
man
or
brother
creature
and
the
sexton
knew
it--how
god
knows
but
he
knew
it
and
hurried
on
to
his
tryst
with
the
dead
his
path
now
lay
along
the
edge
of
a
tidal
inlet
from
the
groix
river
i
looked
down
at
the
gray
water
through
the
leafless
branches
and
i
saw
a
small
snake
head
raised
swim
from
a
submerged
clot
of
weeds
into
the
shadow
of
a
rock
there
was
a
curlew
too
somewhere
in
the
black
swamp
whose
dreary
persistent
call
cursed
the
silence
i
wondered
when
the
sexton
would
fly
for
he
could
fly
if
he
chose
it
is
only
when
the
dead
are
near
very
near
that
he
creeps
the
soiled
mess
of
cobweb
still
stuck
to
him
and
his
progress
was
impeded
by
it
once
i
saw
a
small
brown
and
white
spider
striped
like
a
zebra
running
swiftly
in
his
tracks
but
the
sexton
turned
and
raised
his
two
clubbed
forelegs
in
a
horrid
imploring
attitude
that
still
had
something
of
menace
under
it
the
spider
backed
away
and
sidled
under
a
stone
when
anything
that
is
dying--sick
and
close
to
death--falls
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
something
moves
in
the
blue
above
floating
like
a
moat
then
another
then
others
these
specks
that
grow
out
of
the
fathomless
azure
vault
are
jewelled
flies
they
come
to
wait
for
death
the
sexton
also
arranges
rendezvous
with
death
but
never
waits
death
must
arrive
the
first
when
the
heavy
clover
is
ablaze
with
painted
wings
when
bees
hum
and
blunder
among
the
white-thorn
or
pass
by
like
swift
singing
bullets
the
sexton
snaps
open
his
black
and
orange
wings
and
hums
across
the
clover
with
the
bees
death
in
a
scented
garden
the
tokens
of
the
plague
on
a
fair
young
breast
the
gray
flag
of
fear
in
the
face
of
one
who
reels
into
the
arms
of
destruction
the
sexton
scrambling
in
the
lap
of
spring
folding
his
sleek
wings
unfolding
them
to
ape
the
buzz
of
bees
passing
over
sweet
clover
tops
to
the
putrid
flesh
that
summons
him--these
things
must
be
and
will
be
to
the
end
the
sexton
was
running
now--running
fast
trailing
the
cobweb
over
twigs
and
mud
the
edge
of
the
wood
was
near
for
i
could
see
the
winter
wheat
like
green
scenery
in
a
theatre
stretching
for
miles
across
the
cliffs
crude
as
painted
grass
and
as
i
crept
through
the
brittle
forest
fringe
i
saw
a
figure
lying
face
downward
in
the
wheat--a
girl's
slender
form
limp
motionless
the
sexton
darted
under
her
breast
then
i
threw
myself
down
beside
her
crying
lys
lys
and
as
i
cried
the
icy
rain
burst
out
across
the
moors
and
the
trees
dashed
their
stark
limbs
together
till
the
whole
spectral
forest
tossed
and
danced
and
the
wind
roared
among
the
cliffs
and
through
the
dance
of
death
lys
trembled
in
my
arms
and
sobbed
and
clung
to
me
murmuring
that
the
purple
emperor
was
dead
but
the
wind
tore
the
words
from
her
white
lips
and
flung
them
out
across
the
sea
where
the
winter
lightning
lashed
the
stark
heights
of
groix
then
the
fear
of
death
was
stilled
in
my
soul
and
i
raised
her
from
the
ground
holding
her
close
and
i
saw
the
sexton
just
beyond
us
hurry
across
the
ground
and
seek
shelter
under
a
little
dead
skylark
stiff-winged
muddy
lying
alone
in
the
rain





in
the
storm
above
us
a
bird
hovered
singing
through
the
rain
it
passed
us
twice
still
singing
and
as
it
passed
again
we
saw
the
shadow
it
cast
upon
the
world
was
whiter
than
snow
the
messenger
little
gray
messenger
robed
like
painted
death
your
robe
is
dust
whom
do
you
seek
among
lilies
and
closed
buds
at
dusk
among
lilies
and
closed
buds
at
dusk
whom
do
you
seek
little
gray
messenger
robed
in
the
awful
panoply
of
painted
death
r
w
c
the
messenger
all-wise
hast
thou
seen
all
there
is
to
see
with
thy
two
eyes
dost
thou
know
all
there
is
to
know
and
so
omniscient
darest
thou
still
to
say
thy
brother
lies
r
w
c
the
bullet
entered
here
said
max
fortin
and
he
placed
his
middle
finger
over
a
smooth
hole
exactly
in
the
centre
of
the
forehead
i
sat
down
upon
a
mound
of
dry
seaweed
and
unslung
my
fowling
piece
the
little
chemist
cautiously
felt
the
edges
of
the
shot-hole
first
with
his
middle
finger
then
with
his
thumb
let
me
see
the
skull
again
said
i
max
fortin
picked
it
up
from
the
sod
it's
like
all
the
others
he
observed
i
nodded
without
offering
to
take
it
from
him
after
a
moment
he
thoughtfully
replaced
it
upon
the
grass
at
my
feet
it's
like
all
the
others
he
repeated
wiping
his
glasses
on
his
handkerchief
i
thought
you
might
care
to
see
one
of
the
skulls
so
i
brought
this
over
from
the
gravel
pit
the
men
from
bannalec
are
digging
yet
they
ought
to
stop
how
many
skulls
are
there
altogether
i
inquired
they
found
thirty-eight
skulls
there
are
thirty-nine
noted
in
the
list
they
lie
piled
up
in
the
gravel
pit
on
the
edge
of
le
bihan's
wheat
field
the
men
are
at
work
yet
le
bihan
is
going
to
stop
them
let's
go
over
said
i
and
i
picked
up
my
gun
and
started
across
the
cliffs
fortin
on
one
side
mã´me
on
the
other
who
has
the
list
i
asked
lighting
my
pipe
you
say
there
is
a
list
the
list
was
found
rolled
up
in
a
brass
cylinder
said
the
little
chemist
he
added
you
should
not
smoke
here
you
know
that
if
a
single
spark
drifted
into
the
wheat----
ah
but
i
have
a
cover
to
my
pipe
said
i
smiling
fortin
watched
me
as
i
closed
the
pepper-box
arrangement
over
the
glowing
bowl
of
the
pipe
then
he
continued
the
list
was
made
out
on
thick
yellow
paper
the
brass
tube
has
preserved
it
it
is
as
fresh
to-day
as
it
was
in
1760
you
shall
see
it
is
that
the
date
the
list
is
dated
'april
1760'
the
brigadier
durand
has
it
it
is
not
written
in
french
not
written
in
french
i
exclaimed
no
replied
fortin
solemnly
it
is
written
in
breton
but
i
protested
the
breton
language
was
never
written
or
printed
in
1760
except
by
priests
said
the
chemist
i
have
heard
of
but
one
priest
who
ever
wrote
the
breton
language
i
began
fortin
stole
a
glance
at
my
face
you
mean--the
black
priest
he
asked
i
nodded
fortin
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
again
hesitated
and
finally
shut
his
teeth
obstinately
over
the
wheat
stem
that
he
was
chewing
and
the
black
priest
i
suggested
encouragingly
but
i
knew
it
was
useless
for
it
is
easier
to
move
the
stars
from
their
courses
than
to
make
an
obstinate
breton
talk
we
walked
on
for
a
minute
or
two
in
silence
where
is
the
brigadier
durand
i
asked
motioning
mã´me
to
come
out
of
the
wheat
which
he
was
trampling
as
though
it
were
heather
as
i
spoke
we
came
in
sight
of
the
farther
edge
of
the
wheat
field
and
the
dark
wet
mass
of
cliffs
beyond
durand
is
down
there--you
can
see
him
he
stands
just
behind
the
mayor
of
st
gildas
i
see
said
i
and
we
struck
straight
down
following
a
sun-baked
cattle
path
across
the
heather
when
we
reached
the
edge
of
the
wheat
field
le
bihan
the
mayor
of
st
gildas
called
to
me
and
i
tucked
my
gun
under
my
arm
and
skirted
the
wheat
to
where
he
stood
thirty-eight
skulls
he
said
in
his
thin
high-pitched
voice
there
is
but
one
more
and
i
am
opposed
to
further
search
i
suppose
fortin
told
you
i
shook
hands
with
him
and
returned
the
salute
of
the
brigadier
durand
i
am
opposed
to
further
search
repeated
le
bihan
nervously
picking
at
the
mass
of
silver
buttons
which
covered
the
front
of
his
velvet
and
broadcloth
jacket
like
a
breastplate
of
scale
armour
durand
pursed
up
his
lips
twisted
his
tremendous
mustache
and
hooked
his
thumbs
in
his
sabre
belt
as
for
me
he
said
i
am
in
favour
of
further
search
further
search
for
what--for
the
thirty-ninth
skull
i
asked
le
bihan
nodded
durand
frowned
at
the
sunlit
sea
rocking
like
a
bowl
of
molten
gold
from
the
cliffs
to
the
horizon
i
followed
his
eyes
on
the
dark
glistening
cliffs
silhouetted
against
the
glare
of
the
sea
sat
a
cormorant
black
motionless
its
horrible
head
raised
toward
heaven
where
is
that
list
durand
i
asked
the
gendarme
rummaged
in
his
despatch
pouch
and
produced
a
brass
cylinder
about
a
foot
long
very
gravely
he
unscrewed
the
head
and
dumped
out
a
scroll
of
thick
yellow
paper
closely
covered
with
writing
on
both
sides
at
a
nod
from
le
bihan
he
handed
me
the
scroll
but
i
could
make
nothing
of
the
coarse
writing
now
faded
to
a
dull
brown
come
come
le
bihan
i
said
impatiently
translate
it
won't
you
you
and
max
fortin
make
a
lot
of
mystery
out
of
nothing
it
seems
le
bihan
went
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
where
the
three
bannalec
men
were
digging
gave
an
order
or
two
in
breton
and
turned
to
me
as
i
came
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
the
bannalec
men
were
removing
a
square
piece
of
sail-cloth
from
what
appeared
to
be
a
pile
of
cobblestones
look
said
le
bihan
shrilly
i
looked
the
pile
below
was
a
heap
of
skulls
after
a
moment
i
clambered
down
the
gravel
sides
of
the
pit
and
walked
over
to
the
men
of
bannalec
they
saluted
me
gravely
leaning
on
their
picks
and
shovels
and
wiping
their
sweating
faces
with
sunburned
hands
how
many
said
i
in
breton
thirty-eight
they
replied
i
glanced
around
beyond
the
heap
of
skulls
lay
two
piles
of
human
bones
beside
these
was
a
mound
of
broken
rusted
bits
of
iron
and
steel
looking
closer
i
saw
that
this
mound
was
composed
of
rusty
bayonets
sabre
blades
scythe
blades
with
here
and
there
a
tarnished
buckle
attached
to
a
bit
of
leather
hard
as
iron
i
picked
up
a
couple
of
buttons
and
a
belt
plate
the
buttons
bore
the
royal
arms
of
england
the
belt
plate
was
emblazoned
with
the
english
arms
and
also
with
the
number
27
i
have
heard
my
grandfather
speak
of
the
terrible
english
regiment
the
27th
foot
which
landed
and
stormed
the
fort
up
there
said
one
of
the
bannalec
men
oh
said
i
then
these
are
the
bones
of
english
soldiers
yes
said
the
men
of
bannalec
le
bihan
was
calling
to
me
from
the
edge
of
the
pit
above
and
i
handed
the
belt
plate
and
buttons
to
the
men
and
climbed
the
side
of
the
excavation
well
said
i
trying
to
prevent
mã´me
from
leaping
up
and
licking
my
face
as
i
emerged
from
the
pit
i
suppose
you
know
what
these
bones
are
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
there
was
a
man
said
le
bihan
angrily
an
englishman
who
passed
here
in
a
dog-cart
on
his
way
to
quimper
about
an
hour
ago
and
what
do
you
suppose
he
wished
to
do
buy
the
relics
i
asked
smiling
exactly--the
pig
piped
the
mayor
of
st
gildas
jean
marie
tregunc
who
found
the
bones
was
standing
there
where
max
fortin
stands
and
do
you
know
what
he
answered
he
spat
upon
the
ground
and
said
'pig
of
an
englishman
do
you
take
me
for
a
desecrator
of
graves'
i
knew
tregunc
a
sober
blue-eyed
breton
who
lived
from
one
year's
end
to
the
other
without
being
able
to
afford
a
single
bit
of
meat
for
a
meal
how
much
did
the
englishman
offer
tregunc
i
asked
two
hundred
francs
for
the
skulls
alone
i
thought
of
the
relic
hunters
and
the
relic
buyers
on
the
battlefields
of
our
civil
war
seventeen
hundred
and
sixty
is
long
ago
i
said
respect
for
the
dead
can
never
die
said
fortin
and
the
english
soldiers
came
here
to
kill
your
fathers
and
burn
your
homes
i
continued
they
were
murderers
and
thieves
but--they
are
dead
said
tregunc
coming
up
from
the
beach
below
his
long
sea
rake
balanced
on
his
dripping
jersey
how
much
do
you
earn
every
year
jean
marie
i
asked
turning
to
shake
hands
with
him
two
hundred
and
twenty
francs
monsieur
forty-five
dollars
a
year
i
said
bah
you
are
worth
more
jean
will
you
take
care
of
my
garden
for
me
my
wife
wished
me
to
ask
you
i
think
it
would
be
worth
one
hundred
francs
a
month
to
you
and
to
me
come
on
le
bihan--come
along
fortin--and
you
durand
i
want
somebody
to
translate
that
list
into
french
for
me
tregunc
stood
gazing
at
me
his
blue
eyes
dilated
you
may
begin
at
once
i
said
smiling
if
the
salary
suits
you
it
suits
said
tregunc
fumbling
for
his
pipe
in
a
silly
way
that
annoyed
le
bihan
then
go
and
begin
your
work
cried
the
mayor
impatiently
and
tregunc
started
across
the
moors
toward
st
gildas
taking
off
his
velvet-ribboned
cap
to
me
and
gripping
his
sea
rake
very
hard
you
offer
him
more
than
my
salary
said
the
mayor
after
a
moment's
contemplation
of
his
silver
buttons
pooh
said
i
what
do
you
do
for
your
salary
except
play
dominoes
with
max
fortin
at
the
groix
inn
le
bihan
turned
red
but
durand
rattled
his
sabre
and
winked
at
max
fortin
and
i
slipped
my
arm
through
the
arm
of
the
sulky
magistrate
laughing
there's
a
shady
spot
under
the
cliff
i
said
come
on
le
bihan
and
read
me
what
is
in
the
scroll
in
a
few
moments
we
reached
the
shadow
of
the
cliff
and
i
threw
myself
upon
the
turf
chin
on
hand
to
listen
the
gendarme
durand
also
sat
down
twisting
his
mustache
into
needlelike
points
fortin
leaned
against
the
cliff
polishing
his
glasses
and
examining
us
with
vague
near-sighted
eyes
and
le
bihan
the
mayor
planted
himself
in
our
midst
rolling
up
the
scroll
and
tucking
it
under
his
arm
first
of
all
he
began
in
a
shrill
voice
i
am
going
to
light
my
pipe
and
while
lighting
it
i
shall
tell
you
what
i
have
heard
about
the
attack
on
the
fort
yonder
my
father
told
me
his
father
told
him
he
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
ruined
fort
a
small
square
stone
structure
on
the
sea
cliff
now
nothing
but
crumbling
walls
then
he
slowly
produced
a
tobacco
pouch
a
bit
of
flint
and
tinder
and
a
long-stemmed
pipe
fitted
with
a
microscopical
bowl
of
baked
clay
to
fill
such
a
pipe
requires
ten
minutes'
close
attention
to
smoke
it
to
a
finish
takes
but
four
puffs
it
is
very
breton
this
breton
pipe
it
is
the
crystallization
of
everything
breton
go
on
said
i
lighting
a
cigarette
the
fort
said
the
mayor
was
built
by
louis
xiv
and
was
dismantled
twice
by
the
english
louis
xv
restored
it
in
1739
in
1760
it
was
carried
by
assault
by
the
english
they
came
across
from
the
island
of
groix--three
shiploads--and
they
stormed
the
fort
and
sacked
st
julien
yonder
and
they
started
to
burn
st
gildas--you
can
see
the
marks
of
their
bullets
on
my
house
yet
but
the
men
of
bannalec
and
the
men
of
lorient
fell
upon
them
with
pike
and
scythe
and
blunderbuss
and
those
who
did
not
run
away
lie
there
below
in
the
gravel
pit
now--thirty-eight
of
them
and
the
thirty-ninth
skull
i
asked
finishing
my
cigarette
the
mayor
had
succeeded
in
filling
his
pipe
and
now
he
began
to
put
his
tobacco
pouch
away
the
thirty-ninth
skull
he
mumbled
holding
the
pipestem
between
his
defective
teeth--the
thirty-ninth
skull
is
no
business
of
mine
i
have
told
the
bannalec
men
to
cease
digging
but
what
is--whose
is
the
missing
skull
i
persisted
curiously
the
mayor
was
busy
trying
to
strike
a
spark
to
his
tinder
presently
he
set
it
aglow
applied
it
to
his
pipe
took
the
prescribed
four
puffs
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
the
bowl
and
gravely
replaced
the
pipe
in
his
pocket
the
missing
skull
he
asked
yes
said
i
impatiently
the
mayor
slowly
unrolled
the
scroll
and
began
to
read
translating
from
the
breton
into
french
and
this
is
what
he
read
on
the
cliffs
of
st
gildas
april
13
1760
on
this
day
by
order
of
the
count
of
soisic
general
in
chief
of
the
breton
forces
now
lying
in
kerselec
forest
the
bodies
of
thirty-eight
english
soldiers
of
the
27th
50th
and
72d
regiments
of
foot
were
buried
in
this
spot
together
with
their
arms
and
equipments
the
mayor
paused
and
glanced
at
me
reflectively
go
on
le
bihan
i
said
with
them
continued
the
mayor
turning
the
scroll
and
reading
on
the
other
side
was
buried
the
body
of
that
vile
traitor
who
betrayed
the
fort
to
the
english
the
manner
of
his
death
was
as
follows
by
order
of
the
most
noble
count
of
soisic
the
traitor
was
first
branded
upon
the
forehead
with
the
brand
of
an
arrowhead
the
iron
burned
through
the
flesh
and
was
pressed
heavily
so
that
the
brand
should
even
burn
into
the
bone
of
the
skull
the
traitor
was
then
led
out
and
bidden
to
kneel
he
admitted
having
guided
the
english
from
the
island
of
groix
although
a
priest
and
a
frenchman
he
had
violated
his
priestly
office
to
aid
him
in
discovering
the
password
to
the
fort
this
password
he
extorted
during
confession
from
a
young
breton
girl
who
was
in
the
habit
of
rowing
across
from
the
island
of
groix
to
visit
her
husband
in
the
fort
when
the
fort
fell
this
young
girl
crazed
by
the
death
of
her
husband
sought
the
count
of
soisic
and
told
how
the
priest
had
forced
her
to
confess
to
him
all
she
knew
about
the
fort
the
priest
was
arrested
at
st
gildas
as
he
was
about
to
cross
the
river
to
lorient
when
arrested
he
cursed
the
girl
marie
trevec----
what
i
exclaimed
marie
trevec
marie
trevec
repeated
le
bihan
the
priest
cursed
marie
trevec
and
all
her
family
and
descendants
he
was
shot
as
he
knelt
having
a
mask
of
leather
over
his
face
because
the
bretons
who
composed
the
squad
of
execution
refused
to
fire
at
a
priest
unless
his
face
was
concealed
the
priest
was
l'abbã©
sorgue
commonly
known
as
the
black
priest
on
account
of
his
dark
face
and
swarthy
eyebrows
he
was
buried
with
a
stake
through
his
heart
le
bihan
paused
hesitated
looked
at
me
and
handed
the
manuscript
back
to
durand
the
gendarme
took
it
and
slipped
it
into
the
brass
cylinder
so
said
i
the
thirty-ninth
skull
is
the
skull
of
the
black
priest
yes
said
fortin
i
hope
they
won't
find
it
i
have
forbidden
them
to
proceed
said
the
mayor
querulously
you
heard
me
max
fortin
i
rose
and
picked
up
my
gun
mã´me
came
and
pushed
his
head
into
my
hand
that's
a
fine
dog
observed
durand
also
rising
why
don't
you
wish
to
find
his
skull
i
asked
le
bihan
it
would
be
curious
to
see
whether
the
arrow
brand
really
burned
into
the
bone
there
is
something
in
that
scroll
that
i
didn't
read
to
you
said
the
mayor
grimly
do
you
wish
to
know
what
it
is
of
course
i
replied
in
surprise
give
me
the
scroll
again
durand
he
said
then
he
read
from
the
bottom
i
l'abbã©
sorgue
forced
to
write
the
above
by
my
executioners
have
written
it
in
my
own
blood
and
with
it
i
leave
my
curse
my
curse
on
st
gildas
on
marie
trevec
and
on
her
descendants
i
will
come
back
to
st
gildas
when
my
remains
are
disturbed
woe
to
that
englishman
whom
my
branded
skull
shall
touch
what
rot
i
said
do
you
believe
it
was
really
written
in
his
own
blood
i
am
going
to
test
it
said
fortin
at
the
request
of
monsieur
le
maire
i
am
not
anxious
for
the
job
however
see
said
le
bihan
holding
out
the
scroll
to
me
it
is
signed
'l'abbã©
sorgue'
i
glanced
curiously
over
the
paper
it
must
be
the
black
priest
i
said
he
was
the
only
man
who
wrote
in
the
breton
language
this
is
a
wonderfully
interesting
discovery
for
now
at
last
the
mystery
of
the
black
priest's
disappearance
is
cleared
up
you
will
of
course
send
this
scroll
to
paris
le
bihan
no
said
the
mayor
obstinately
it
shall
be
buried
in
the
pit
below
where
the
rest
of
the
black
priest
lies
i
looked
at
him
and
recognised
that
argument
would
be
useless
but
still
i
said
it
will
be
a
loss
to
history
monsieur
le
bihan
all
the
worse
for
history
then
said
the
enlightened
mayor
of
st
gildas
we
had
sauntered
back
to
the
gravel
pit
while
speaking
the
men
of
bannalec
were
carrying
the
bones
of
the
english
soldiers
toward
the
st
gildas
cemetery
on
the
cliffs
to
the
east
where
already
a
knot
of
white-coiffed
women
stood
in
attitudes
of
prayer
and
i
saw
the
sombre
robe
of
a
priest
among
the
crosses
of
the
little
graveyard
they
were
thieves
and
assassins
they
are
dead
now
muttered
max
fortin
respect
the
dead
repeated
the
mayor
of
st
gildas
looking
after
the
bannalec
men
it
was
written
in
that
scroll
that
marie
trevec
of
groix
island
was
cursed
by
the
priest--she
and
her
descendants
i
said
touching
le
bihan
on
the
arm
there
was
a
marie
trevec
who
married
an
yves
trevec
of
st
gildas----
it
is
the
same
said
le
bihan
looking
at
me
obliquely
oh
said
i
then
they
were
ancestors
of
my
wife
do
you
fear
the
curse
asked
le
bihan
what
i
laughed
there
was
the
case
of
the
purple
emperor
said
max
fortin
timidly
startled
for
a
moment
i
faced
him
then
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
kicked
at
a
smooth
bit
of
rock
which
lay
near
the
edge
of
the
pit
almost
embedded
in
gravel
do
you
suppose
the
purple
emperor
drank
himself
crazy
because
he
was
descended
from
marie
trevec
i
asked
contemptuously
of
course
not
said
max
fortin
hastily
of
course
not
piped
the
mayor
i
only----
hello
what's
that
you're
kicking
what
said
i
glancing
down
at
the
same
time
involuntarily
giving
another
kick
the
smooth
bit
of
rock
dislodged
itself
and
rolled
out
of
the
loosened
gravel
at
my
feet
the
thirty-ninth
skull
i
exclaimed
by
jingo
its
the
noddle
of
the
black
priest
see
there
is
the
arrowhead
branded
on
the
front
the
mayor
stepped
back
max
fortin
also
retreated
there
was
a
pause
during
which
i
looked
at
them
and
they
looked
anywhere
but
at
me
i
don't
like
it
said
the
mayor
at
last
in
a
husky
high
voice
i
don't
like
it
the
scroll
says
he
will
come
back
to
st
gildas
when
his
remains
are
disturbed
i--i
don't
like
it
monsieur
darrel----
bosh
said
i
the
poor
wicked
devil
is
where
he
can't
get
out
for
heaven's
sake
le
bihan
what
is
this
stuff
you
are
talking
in
the
year
of
grace
1896
the
mayor
gave
me
a
look
and
he
says
'englishman'
you
are
an
englishman
monsieur
darrel
he
announced
you
know
better
you
know
i'm
an
american
it's
all
the
same
said
the
mayor
of
st
gildas
obstinately
no
it
isn't
i
answered
much
exasperated
and
deliberately
pushed
the
skull
till
it
rolled
into
the
bottom
of
the
gravel
pit
below
cover
it
up
said
i
bury
the
scroll
with
it
too
if
you
insist
but
i
think
you
ought
to
send
it
to
paris
don't
look
so
gloomy
fortin
unless
you
believe
in
were-wolves
and
ghosts
hey
what
the--what
the
devil's
the
matter
with
you
anyway
what
are
you
staring
at
le
bihan
come
come
muttered
the
mayor
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
it's
time
we
got
out
of
this
did
you
see
did
you
see
fortin
i
saw
whispered
max
fortin
pallid
with
fright
the
two
men
were
almost
running
across
the
sunny
pasture
now
and
i
hastened
after
them
demanding
to
know
what
was
the
matter
matter
chattered
the
mayor
gasping
with
exasperation
and
terror
the
skull
is
rolling
uphill
again
and
he
burst
into
a
terrified
gallop
max
fortin
followed
close
behind
i
watched
them
stampeding
across
the
pasture
then
turned
toward
the
gravel
pit
mystified
incredulous
the
skull
was
lying
on
the
edge
of
the
pit
exactly
where
it
had
been
before
i
pushed
it
over
the
edge
for
a
second
i
stared
at
it
a
singular
chilly
feeling
crept
up
my
spinal
column
and
i
turned
and
walked
away
sweat
starting
from
the
root
of
every
hair
on
my
head
before
i
had
gone
twenty
paces
the
absurdity
of
the
whole
thing
struck
me
i
halted
hot
with
shame
and
annoyance
and
retraced
my
steps
there
lay
the
skull
i
rolled
a
stone
down
instead
of
the
skull
i
muttered
to
myself
then
with
the
butt
of
my
gun
i
pushed
the
skull
over
the
edge
of
the
pit
and
watched
it
roll
to
the
bottom
and
as
it
struck
the
bottom
of
the
pit
mã´me
my
dog
suddenly
whipped
his
tail
between
his
legs
whimpered
and
made
off
across
the
moor
mã´me
i
shouted
angry
and
astonished
but
the
dog
only
fled
the
faster
and
i
ceased
calling
from
sheer
surprise
what
the
mischief
is
the
matter
with
that
dog
i
thought
he
had
never
before
played
me
such
a
trick
mechanically
i
glanced
into
the
pit
but
i
could
not
see
the
skull
i
looked
down
the
skull
lay
at
my
feet
again
touching
them
good
heavens
i
stammered
and
struck
at
it
blindly
with
my
gunstock
the
ghastly
thing
flew
into
the
air
whirling
over
and
over
and
rolled
again
down
the
sides
of
the
pit
to
the
bottom
breathlessly
i
stared
at
it
then
confused
and
scarcely
comprehending
i
stepped
back
from
the
pit
still
facing
it
one
ten
twenty
paces
my
eyes
almost
starting
from
my
head
as
though
i
expected
to
see
the
thing
roll
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
pit
under
my
very
gaze
at
last
i
turned
my
back
to
the
pit
and
strode
out
across
the
gorse-covered
moorland
toward
my
home
as
i
reached
the
road
that
winds
from
st
gildas
to
st
julien
i
gave
one
hasty
glance
at
the
pit
over
my
shoulder
the
sun
shone
hot
on
the
sod
about
the
excavation
there
was
something
white
and
bare
and
round
on
the
turf
at
the
edge
of
the
pit
it
might
have
been
a
stone
there
were
plenty
of
them
lying
about
ii
when
i
entered
my
garden
i
saw
mã´me
sprawling
on
the
stone
doorstep
he
eyed
me
sideways
and
flopped
his
tail
are
you
not
mortified
you
idiot
dog
i
said
looking
about
the
upper
windows
for
lys
mã´me
rolled
over
on
his
back
and
raised
one
deprecating
forepaw
as
though
to
ward
off
calamity
don't
act
as
though
i
was
in
the
habit
of
beating
you
to
death
i
said
disgusted
i
had
never
in
my
life
raised
whip
to
the
brute
but
you
are
a
fool
dog
i
continued
no
you
needn't
come
to
be
babied
and
wept
over
lys
can
do
that
if
she
insists
but
i
am
ashamed
of
you
and
you
can
go
to
the
devil
mã´me
slunk
off
into
the
house
and
i
followed
mounting
directly
to
my
wife's
boudoir
it
was
empty
where
has
she
gone
i
said
looking
hard
at
mã´me
who
had
followed
me
oh
i
see
you
don't
know
don't
pretend
you
do
come
off
that
lounge
do
you
think
lys
wants
tan-coloured
hairs
all
over
her
lounge
i
rang
the
bell
for
catherine
and
'fine
but
they
didn't
know
where
madame
had
gone
so
i
went
into
my
room
bathed
exchanged
my
somewhat
grimy
shooting
clothes
for
a
suit
of
warm
soft
knickerbockers
and
after
lingering
some
extra
moments
over
my
toilet--for
i
was
particular
now
that
i
had
married
lys--i
went
down
to
the
garden
and
took
a
chair
out
under
the
fig-trees
where
can
she
be
i
wondered
mã´me
came
sneaking
out
to
be
comforted
and
i
forgave
him
for
lys's
sake
whereupon
he
frisked
you
bounding
cur
said
i
now
what
on
earth
started
you
off
across
the
moor
if
you
do
it
again
i'll
push
you
along
with
a
charge
of
dust
shot
as
yet
i
had
scarcely
dared
think
about
the
ghastly
hallucination
of
which
i
had
been
a
victim
but
now
i
faced
it
squarely
flushing
a
little
with
mortification
at
the
thought
of
my
hasty
retreat
from
the
gravel
pit
to
think
i
said
aloud
that
those
old
woman's
tales
of
max
fortin
and
le
bihan
should
have
actually
made
me
see
what
didn't
exist
at
all
i
lost
my
nerve
like
a
schoolboy
in
a
dark
bedroom
for
i
knew
now
that
i
had
mistaken
a
round
stone
for
a
skull
each
time
and
had
pushed
a
couple
of
big
pebbles
into
the
pit
instead
of
the
skull
itself
by
jingo
said
i
i'm
nervous
my
liver
must
be
in
a
devil
of
a
condition
if
i
see
such
things
when
i'm
awake
lys
will
know
what
to
give
me
i
felt
mortified
and
irritated
and
sulky
and
thought
disgustedly
of
le
bihan
and
max
fortin
but
after
a
while
i
ceased
speculating
dismissed
the
mayor
the
chemist
and
the
skull
from
my
mind
and
smoked
pensively
watching
the
sun
low
dipping
in
the
western
ocean
as
the
twilight
fell
for
a
moment
over
ocean
and
moorland
a
wistful
restless
happiness
filled
my
heart
the
happiness
that
all
men
know--all
men
who
have
loved
slowly
the
purple
mist
crept
out
over
the
sea
the
cliffs
darkened
the
forest
was
shrouded
suddenly
the
sky
above
burned
with
the
afterglow
and
the
world
was
alight
again
cloud
after
cloud
caught
the
rose
dye
the
cliffs
were
tinted
with
it
moor
and
pasture
heather
and
forest
burned
and
pulsated
with
the
gentle
flush
i
saw
the
gulls
turning
and
tossing
above
the
sand
bar
their
snowy
wings
tipped
with
pink
i
saw
the
sea
swallows
sheering
the
surface
of
the
still
river
stained
to
its
placid
depths
with
warm
reflections
of
the
clouds
the
twitter
of
drowsy
hedge
birds
broke
out
in
the
stillness
a
salmon
rolled
its
shining
side
above
tide-water
the
interminable
monotone
of
the
ocean
intensified
the
silence
i
sat
motionless
holding
my
breath
as
one
who
listens
to
the
first
low
rumour
of
an
organ
all
at
once
the
pure
whistle
of
a
nightingale
cut
the
silence
and
the
first
moonbeam
silvered
the
wastes
of
mist-hung
waters
i
raised
my
head
lys
stood
before
me
in
the
garden
when
we
had
kissed
each
other
we
linked
arms
and
moved
up
and
down
the
gravel
walks
watching
the
moonbeams
sparkle
on
the
sand
bar
as
the
tide
ebbed
and
ebbed
the
broad
beds
of
white
pinks
about
us
were
atremble
with
hovering
white
moths
the
october
roses
hung
all
abloom
perfuming
the
salt
wind
sweetheart
i
said
where
is
yvonne
has
she
promised
to
spend
christmas
with
us
yes
dick
she
drove
me
down
from
plougat
this
afternoon
she
sent
her
love
to
you
i
am
not
jealous
what
did
you
shoot
a
hare
and
four
partridges
they
are
in
the
gun
room
i
told
catherine
not
to
touch
them
until
you
had
seen
them
now
i
suppose
i
knew
that
lys
could
not
be
particularly
enthusiastic
over
game
or
guns
but
she
pretended
she
was
and
always
scornfully
denied
that
it
was
for
my
sake
and
not
for
the
pure
love
of
sport
so
she
dragged
me
off
to
inspect
the
rather
meagre
game
bag
and
she
paid
me
pretty
compliments
and
gave
a
little
cry
of
delight
and
pity
as
i
lifted
the
enormous
hare
out
of
the
sack
by
his
ears
he'll
eat
no
more
of
our
lettuce
i
said
attempting
to
justify
the
assassination
unhappy
little
bunny--and
what
a
beauty
o
dick
you
are
a
splendid
shot
are
you
not
i
evaded
the
question
and
hauled
out
a
partridge
poor
little
dead
things
said
lys
in
a
whisper
it
seems
a
pity--doesn't
it
dick
but
then
you
are
so
clever----
we'll
have
them
broiled
i
said
guardedly
tell
catherine
catherine
came
in
to
take
away
the
game
and
presently
'fine
lelocard
lys's
maid
announced
dinner
and
lys
tripped
away
to
her
boudoir
i
stood
an
instant
contemplating
her
blissfully
thinking
my
boy
you're
the
happiest
fellow
in
the
world--you're
in
love
with
your
wife
i
walked
into
the
dining
room
beamed
at
the
plates
walked
out
again
met
tregunc
in
the
hallway
beamed
on
him
glanced
into
the
kitchen
beamed
at
catherine
and
went
up
stairs
still
beaming
before
i
could
knock
at
lys's
door
it
opened
and
lys
came
hastily
out
when
she
saw
me
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
relief
and
nestled
close
to
my
breast
there
is
something
peering
in
at
my
window
she
said
what
i
cried
angrily
a
man
i
think
disguised
as
a
priest
and
he
has
a
mask
on
he
must
have
climbed
up
by
the
bay
tree
i
was
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
doors
in
no
time
the
moonlit
garden
was
absolutely
deserted
tregunc
came
up
and
together
we
searched
the
hedge
and
shrubbery
around
the
house
and
out
to
the
road
jean
marie
said
i
at
length
loose
my
bulldog--he
knows
you--and
take
your
supper
on
the
porch
where
you
can
watch
my
wife
says
the
fellow
is
disguised
as
a
priest
and
wears
a
mask
tregunc
showed
his
white
teeth
in
a
smile
he
will
not
care
to
venture
in
here
again
i
think
monsieur
darrel
i
went
back
and
found
lys
seated
quietly
at
the
table
the
soup
is
ready
dear
she
said
don't
worry
it
was
only
some
foolish
lout
from
bannalec
no
one
in
st
gildas
or
st
julien
would
do
such
a
thing
i
was
too
much
exasperated
to
reply
at
first
but
lys
treated
it
as
a
stupid
joke
and
after
a
while
i
began
to
look
at
it
in
that
light
lys
told
me
about
yvonne
and
reminded
me
of
my
promise
to
have
herbert
stuart
down
to
meet
her
you
wicked
diplomat
i
protested
herbert
is
in
paris
and
hard
at
work
for
the
salon
don't
you
think
he
might
spare
a
week
to
flirt
with
the
prettiest
girl
in
finistã¨re
inquired
lys
innocently
prettiest
girl
not
much
i
said
who
is
then
urged
lys
i
laughed
a
trifle
sheepishly
i
suppose
you
mean
me
dick
said
lys
colouring
up
now
i
bore
you
don't
i
bore
me
ah
no
dick
after
coffee
and
cigarettes
were
served
i
spoke
about
tregunc
and
lys
approved
poor
jean
he
will
be
glad
won't
he
what
a
dear
fellow
you
are
nonsense
said
i
we
need
a
gardener
you
said
so
yourself
lys
but
lys
leaned
over
and
kissed
me
and
then
bent
down
and
hugged
mã´me
who
whistled
through
his
nose
in
sentimental
appreciation
i
am
a
very
happy
woman
said
lys
mã´me
was
a
very
bad
dog
to-day
i
observed
poor
mã´me
said
lys
smiling
when
dinner
was
over
and
mã´me
lay
snoring
before
the
blaze--for
the
october
nights
are
often
chilly
in
finistã¨re--lys
curled
up
in
the
chimney
corner
with
her
embroidery
and
gave
me
a
swift
glance
from
under
her
drooping
lashes
you
look
like
a
schoolgirl
lys
i
said
teasingly
i
don't
believe
you
are
sixteen
yet
she
pushed
back
her
heavy
burnished
hair
thoughtfully
her
wrist
was
as
white
as
surf
foam
have
we
been
married
four
years
i
don't
believe
it
i
said
she
gave
me
another
swift
glance
and
touched
the
embroidery
on
her
knee
smiling
faintly
i
see
said
i
also
smiling
at
the
embroidered
garment
do
you
think
it
will
fit
fit
repeated
lys
then
she
laughed
and
i
persisted
are
you
perfectly
sure
that
you--er--we
shall
need
it
perfectly
said
lys
a
delicate
colour
touched
her
cheeks
and
neck
she
held
up
the
little
garment
all
fluffy
with
misty
lace
and
wrought
with
quaint
embroidery
it
is
very
gorgeous
said
i
don't
use
your
eyes
too
much
dearest
may
i
smoke
a
pipe
of
course
she
said
selecting
a
skein
of
pale
blue
silk
for
a
while
i
sat
and
smoked
in
silence
watching
her
slender
fingers
among
the
tinted
silks
and
thread
of
gold
presently
she
spoke
what
did
you
say
your
crest
is
dick
my
crest
oh
something
or
other
rampant
on
a
something
or
other----
dick
dearest
don't
be
flippant
but
i
really
forget
it's
an
ordinary
crest
everybody
in
new
york
has
them
no
family
should
be
without
'em
you
are
disagreeable
dick
send
josephine
upstairs
for
my
album
are
you
going
to
put
that
crest
on
the--the--whatever
it
is
i
am
and
my
own
crest
too
i
thought
of
the
purple
emperor
and
wondered
a
little
you
didn't
know
i
had
one
did
you
she
smiled
what
is
it
i
replied
evasively
you
shall
see
ring
for
josephine
i
rang
and
when
'fine
appeared
lys
gave
her
some
orders
in
a
low
voice
and
josephine
trotted
away
bobbing
her
white-coiffed
head
with
a
bien
madame
after
a
few
minutes
she
returned
bearing
a
tattered
musty
volume
from
which
the
gold
and
blue
had
mostly
disappeared
i
took
the
book
in
my
hands
and
examined
the
ancient
emblazoned
covers
lilies
i
exclaimed
fleur-de-lis
said
my
wife
demurely
oh
said
i
astonished
and
opened
the
book
you
have
never
before
seen
this
book
asked
lys
with
a
touch
of
malice
in
her
eyes
you
know
i
haven't
hello
what's
this
oho
so
there
should
be
a
de
before
trevec
lys
de
trevec
then
why
in
the
world
did
the
purple
emperor----
dick
cried
lys
all
right
said
i
shall
i
read
about
the
sieur
de
trevec
who
rode
to
saladin's
tent
alone
to
seek
for
medicine
for
st
louis
or
shall
i
read
about--what
is
it
oh
here
it
is
all
down
in
black
and
white--about
the
marquis
de
trevec
who
drowned
himself
before
alva's
eyes
rather
than
surrender
the
banner
of
the
fleur-de-lis
to
spain
it's
all
written
here
but
dear
how
about
that
soldier
named
trevec
who
was
killed
in
the
old
fort
on
the
cliff
yonder
he
dropped
the
de
and
the
trevecs
since
then
have
been
republicans
said
lys--all
except
me
that's
quite
right
said
i
it
is
time
that
we
republicans
should
agree
upon
some
feudal
system
my
dear
i
drink
to
the
king
and
i
raised
my
wine-glass
and
looked
at
lys
to
the
king
said
lys
flushing
she
smoothed
out
the
tiny
garment
on
her
knees
she
touched
the
glass
with
her
lips
her
eyes
were
very
sweet
i
drained
the
glass
to
the
king
after
a
silence
i
said
i
will
tell
the
king
stories
his
majesty
shall
be
amused
his
majesty
repeated
lys
softly
or
hers
i
laughed
who
knows
who
knows
murmured
lys
with
a
gentle
sigh
i
know
some
stories
about
jack
the
giant-killer
i
announced
do
you
lys
i
no
not
about
a
giant-killer
but
i
know
all
about
the
were-wolf
and
jeanne-la-flamme
and
the
man
in
purple
tatters
and--o
dear
me
i
know
lots
more
you
are
very
wise
said
i
i
shall
teach
his
majesty
english
and
i
breton
cried
lys
jealously
i
shall
bring
playthings
to
the
king
said
i--big
green
lizards
from
the
gorse
little
gray
mullets
to
swim
in
glass
globes
baby
rabbits
from
the
forest
of
kerselec----
and
i
said
lys
will
bring
the
first
primrose
the
first
branch
of
aubepine
the
first
jonquil
to
the
king--my
king
our
king
said
i
and
there
was
peace
in
finistã¨re
i
lay
back
idly
turning
the
leaves
of
the
curious
old
volume
i
am
looking
said
i
for
the
crest
the
crest
dear
it
is
a
priest's
head
with
an
arrow-shaped
mark
on
the
forehead
on
a
field----
i
sat
up
and
stared
at
my
wife
dick
whatever
is
the
matter
she
smiled
the
story
is
there
in
that
book
do
you
care
to
read
it
no
shall
i
tell
it
to
you
well
then
it
happened
in
the
third
crusade
there
was
a
monk
whom
men
called
the
black
priest
he
turned
apostate
and
sold
himself
to
the
enemies
of
christ
a
sieur
de
trevec
burst
into
the
saracen
camp
at
the
head
of
only
one
hundred
lances
and
carried
the
black
priest
away
out
of
the
very
midst
of
their
army
so
that
is
how
you
come
by
the
crest
i
said
quietly
but
i
thought
of
the
branded
skull
in
the
gravel
pit
and
wondered
yes
said
lys
the
sieur
de
trevec
cut
the
black
priest's
head
off
but
first
he
branded
him
with
an
arrow
mark
on
the
forehead
the
book
says
it
was
a
pious
action
and
the
sieur
de
trevec
got
great
merit
by
it
but
i
think
it
was
cruel
the
branding
she
sighed
did
you
ever
hear
of
any
other
black
priest
yes
there
was
one
in
the
last
century
here
in
st
gildas
he
cast
a
white
shadow
in
the
sun
he
wrote
in
the
breton
language
chronicles
too
i
believe
i
never
saw
them
his
name
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
old
chronicler
and
of
the
other
priest
jacques
sorgue
some
said
he
was
a
lineal
descendant
of
the
traitor
of
course
the
first
black
priest
was
bad
enough
for
anything
but
if
he
did
have
a
child
it
need
not
have
been
the
ancestor
of
the
last
jacques
sorgue
they
say
this
one
was
a
holy
man
they
say
he
was
so
good
he
was
not
allowed
to
die
but
was
caught
up
to
heaven
one
day
added
lys
with
believing
eyes
i
smiled
but
he
disappeared
persisted
lys
i'm
afraid
his
journey
was
in
another
direction
i
said
jestingly
and
thoughtlessly
told
her
the
story
of
the
morning
i
had
utterly
forgotten
the
masked
man
at
her
window
but
before
i
finished
i
remembered
him
fast
enough
and
realized
what
i
had
done
as
i
saw
her
face
whiten
lys
i
urged
tenderly
that
was
only
some
clumsy
clown's
trick
you
said
so
yourself
you
are
not
superstitious
my
dear
her
eyes
were
on
mine
she
slowly
drew
the
little
gold
cross
from
her
bosom
and
kissed
it
but
her
lips
trembled
as
they
pressed
the
symbol
of
faith
iii
about
nine
o'clock
the
next
morning
i
walked
into
the
groix
inn
and
sat
down
at
the
long
discoloured
oaken

inquired

a
dash
of

i
replied
she

delicious
quimperlã©
cider
and
i
poured
a
little
bordeaux
into
it
marianne

laughing
black

cheeks

red
marianne
i
asked

practical
fellow

is
all
due
to
your
kindness----
began
the
girl
but
i
raised
my
hand
and
held
up
the
glass
it's
due
to
himself
to
your
happiness
marianne
and
i
took
a
hearty
draught
of
the
schist
now
said
i
tell
me
where
i
can
find
le
bihan
and
max
fortin
monsieur
le
bihan
and
monsieur
fortin
are
above
in
the
broad
room
i
believe
they
are
examining
the
red
admiral's
effects
to
send
them
to
paris
oh
i
know
may
i
go
up
marianne
and
god

smiled
the
girl
when
i
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
broad
room
above
little
max
fortin
opened
it
dust
covered
his
spectacles
and
nose
his
hat
with
the
tiny
velvet
ribbons
fluttering
was
all
awry
come
in
monsieur
darrel
he
said
the
mayor
and
i
are
packing
up
the
effects
of
the
purple
emperor
and
of
the
poor
red
admiral
the
collections
i
asked
entering
the
room
you
must
be
very
careful
in
packing
those
butterfly
cases
the
slightest
jar
might
break
wings
and
antennã¦
you
know
le
bihan
shook
hands
with
me
and
pointed
to
the
great
pile
of
boxes
they're
all
cork
lined
he
said
but
fortin
and
i
are
putting
felt
around
each
box
the
entomological
society
of
paris
pays
the
freight
the
combined
collections
of
the
red
admiral
and
the
purple
emperor
made
a
magnificent
display
i
lifted
and
inspected
case
after
case
set
with
gorgeous
butterflies
and
moths
each
specimen
carefully
labelled
with
the
name
in
latin
there
were
cases
filled
with
crimson
tiger
moths
all
aflame
with
colour
cases
devoted
to
the
common
yellow
butterflies
symphonies
in
orange
and
pale
yellow
cases
of
soft
gray
and
dun-coloured
sphinx
moths
and
cases
of
garish
nettle-bred
butterflies
of
the
numerous
family
of
vanessa
all
alone
in
a
great
case
by
itself
was
pinned
the
purple
emperor
the
apatura
iris
that
fatal
specimen
that
had
given
the
purple
emperor
his
name
and
quietus
i
remembered
the
butterfly
and
stood
looking
at
it
with
bent
eyebrows
le
bihan
glanced
up
from
the
floor
where
he
was
nailing
down
the
lid
of
a
box
full
of
cases
it
is
settled
then
said
he
that
madame
your
wife
gives
the
purple
emperor's
entire
collection
to
the
city
of
paris
i
nodded
without
accepting
anything
for
it
it
is
a
gift
i
said
including
the
purple
emperor
there
in
the
case
that
butterfly
is
worth
a
great
deal
of
money
persisted
le
bihan
you
don't
suppose
that
we
would
wish
to
sell
that
specimen
do
you
i
answered
a
trifle
sharply
if
i
were
you
i
should
destroy
it
said
the
mayor
in
his
high-pitched
voice
that
would
be
nonsense
said
i--like
your
burying
the
brass
cylinder
and
scroll
yesterday
it
was
not
nonsense
said
le
bihan
doggedly
and
i
should
prefer
not
to
discuss
the
subject
of
the
scroll
i
looked
at
max
fortin
who
immediately
avoided
my
eyes
you
are
a
pair
of
superstitious
old
women
said
i
digging
my
hands
into
my
pockets
you
swallow
every
nursery
tale
that
is
invented
what
of
it
said
le
bihan
sulkily
there's
more
truth
than
lies
in
most
of
'em
oh
i
sneered
does
the
mayor
of
st
gildas
and
st
julien
believe
in
the
loup-garou
no
not
in
the
loup-garou
in
what
then--jeanne-la-flamme
that
said
le
bihan
with
conviction
is
history
the
devil
it
is
said
i
and
perhaps
monsieur
the
mayor
your
faith
in
giants
is
unimpaired
there
were
giants--everybody
knows
it
growled
max
fortin
and
you
a
chemist
i
observed
scornfully
listen
monsieur
darrel
squeaked
le
bihan
you
know
yourself
that
the
purple
emperor
was
a
scientific
man
now
suppose
i
should
tell
you
that
he
always
refused
to
include
in
his
collection
a
death's
messenger
a
what
i
exclaimed
you
know
what
i
mean--that
moth
that
flies
by
night
some
call
it
the
death's
head
but
in
st
gildas
we
call
it
'death's
messenger'
oh
said
i
you
mean
that
big
sphinx
moth
that
is
commonly
known
as
the
'death's-head
moth'
why
the
mischief
should
the
people
here
call
it
death's
messenger
for
hundreds
of
years
it
has
been
known
as
death's
messenger
in
st
gildas
said
max
fortin
even
froissart
speaks
of
it
in
his
commentaries
on
jacques
sorgue's
chronicles
the
book
is
in
your
library
sorgue
and
who
was
jacques
sorgue
i
never
read
his
book
jacques
sorgue
was
the
son
of
some
unfrocked
priest--i
forget
it
was
during
the
crusades
good
heavens
i
burst
out
i've
been
hearing
of
nothing
but
crusades
and
priests
and
death
and
sorcery
ever
since
i
kicked
that
skull
into
the
gravel
pit
and
i
am
tired
of
it
i
tell
you
frankly
one
would
think
we
lived
in
the
dark
ages
do
you
know
what
year
of
our
lord
it
is
le
bihan
eighteen
hundred
and
ninety-six
replied
the
mayor
and
yet
you
two
hulking
men
are
afraid
of
a
death's-head
moth
i
don't
care
to
have
one
fly
into
the
window
said
max
fortin
it
means
evil
to
the
house
and
the
people
in
it
god
alone
knows
why
he
marked
one
of
his
creatures
with
a
yellow
death's
head
on
the
back
observed
le
bihan
piously
but
i
take
it
that
he
meant
it
as
a
warning
and
i
propose
to
profit
by
it
he
added
triumphantly
see
here
le
bihan
i
said
by
a
stretch
of
imagination
one
can
make
out
a
skull
on
the
thorax
of
a
certain
big
sphinx
moth
what
of
it
it
is
a
bad
thing
to
touch
said
the
mayor
wagging
his
head
it
squeaks
when
handled
added
max
fortin
some
creatures
squeak
all
the
time
i
observed
looking
hard
at
le
bihan
pigs
added
the
mayor
yes
and
asses
i
replied
listen
le
bihan
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
saw
that
skull
roll
uphill
yesterday
the
mayor
shut
his
mouth
tightly
and
picked
up
his
hammer
don't
be
obstinate
i
said
i
asked
you
a
question
and
i
refuse
to
answer
snapped
le
bihan
fortin
saw
what
i
saw
let
him
talk
about
it
i
looked
searchingly
at
the
little
chemist
i
don't
say
that
i
saw
it
actually
roll
up
out
of
the
pit
all
by
itself
said
fortin
with
a
shiver
but--but
then
how
did
it
come
up
out
of
the
pit
if
it
didn't
roll
up
all
by
itself
it
didn't
come
up
at
all
that
was
a
yellow
cobblestone
that
you
mistook
for
the
skull
again
i
replied
you
were
nervous
max
a--a
very
curious
cobblestone
monsieur
darrel
said
fortin
i
also
was
a
victim
to
the
same
hallucination
i
continued
and
i
regret
to
say
that
i
took
the
trouble
to
roll
two
innocent
cobblestones
into
the
gravel
pit
imagining
each
time
that
it
was
the
skull
i
was
rolling
it
was
observed
le
bihan
with
a
morose
shrug
it
just
shows
said
i
ignoring
the
mayor's
remark
how
easy
it
is
to
fix
up
a
train
of
coincidences
so
that
the
result
seems
to
savour
of
the
supernatural
now
last
night
my
wife
imagined
that
she
saw
a
priest
in
a
mask
peer
in
at
her
window----
fortin
and
le
bihan
scrambled
hastily
from
their
knees
dropping
hammer
and
nails
w-h-a-t--what's
that
demanded
the
mayor
i
repeated
what
i
had
said
max
fortin
turned
livid
my
god
muttered
le
bihan
the
black
priest
is
in
st
gildas
d-don't
you--you
know
the
old
prophecy
stammered
fortin
froissart
quotes
it
from
jacques
sorgue
'when
the
black
priest
rises
from
the
dead
st
gildas
folk
shall
shriek
in
bed
when
the
black
priest
rises
from
his
grave
may
the
good
god
st
gildas
save'
aristide
le
bihan
i
said
angrily
and
you
max
fortin
i've
got
enough
of
this
nonsense
some
foolish
lout
from
bannalec
has
been
in
st
gildas
playing
tricks
to
frighten
old
fools
like
you
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
talk
about
than
nursery
legends
i'll
wait
until
you
come
to
your
senses
good-morning
and
i
walked
out
more
disturbed
than
i
cared
to
acknowledge
to
myself
the
day
had
become
misty
and
overcast
heavy
wet
clouds
hung
in
the
east
i
heard
the
surf
thundering
against
the
cliffs
and
the
gray
gulls
squealed
as
they
tossed
and
turned
high
in
the
sky
the
tide
was
creeping
across
the
river
sands
higher
higher
and
i
saw
the
seaweed
floating
on
the
beach
and
the
lanã§ons
springing
from
the
foam
silvery
thread-like
flashes
in
the
gloom
curlew
were
flying
up
the
river
in
twos
and
threes
the
timid
sea
swallows
skimmed
across
the
moors
toward
some
quiet
lonely
pool
safe
from
the
coming
tempest
in
every
hedge
field
birds
were
gathering
huddling
together
twittering
restlessly
when
i
reached
the
cliffs
i
sat
down
resting
my
chin
on
my
clenched
hands
already
a
vast
curtain
of
rain
sweeping
across
the
ocean
miles
away
hid
the
island
of
groix
to
the
east
behind
the
white
semaphore
on
the
hills
black
clouds
crowded
up
over
the
horizon
after
a
little
the
thunder
boomed
dull
distant
and
slender
skeins
of
lightning
unravelled
across
the
crest
of
the
coming
storm
under
the
cliff
at
my
feet
the
surf
rushed
foaming
over
the
shore
and
the
lanã§ons
jumped
and
skipped
and
quivered
until
they
seemed
to
be
but
the
reflections
of
the
meshed
lightning
i
turned
to
the
east
it
was
raining
over
groix
it
was
raining
at
sainte
barbe
it
was
raining
now
at
the
semaphore
high
in
the
storm
whirl
a
few
gulls
pitched
a
nearer
cloud
trailed
veils
of
rain
in
its
wake
the
sky
was
spattered
with
lightning
the
thunder
boomed
as
i
rose
to
go
a
cold
raindrop
fell
upon
the
back
of
my
hand
and
another
and
yet
another
on
my
face
i
gave
a
last
glance
at
the
sea
where
the
waves
were
bursting
into
strange
white
shapes
that
seemed
to
fling
out
menacing
arms
toward
me
then
something
moved
on
the
cliff
something
black
as
the
black
rock
it
clutched--a
filthy
cormorant
craning
its
hideous
head
at
the
sky
slowly
i
plodded
homeward
across
the
sombre
moorland
where
the
gorse
stems
glimmered
with
a
dull
metallic
green
and
the
heather
no
longer
violet
and
purple
hung
drenched
and
dun-coloured
among
the
dreary
rocks
the
wet
turf
creaked
under
my
heavy
boots
the
black-thorn
scraped
and
grated
against
knee
and
elbow
over
all
lay
a
strange
light
pallid
ghastly
where
the
sea
spray
whirled
across
the
landscape
and
drove
into
my
face
until
it
grew
numb
with
the
cold
in
broad
bands
rank
after
rank
billow
on
billow
the
rain
burst
out
across
the
endless
moors
and
yet
there
was
no
wind
to
drive
it
at
such
a
pace
lys
stood
at
the
door
as
i
turned
into
the
garden
motioning
me
to
hasten
and
then
for
the
first
time
i
became
conscious
that
i
was
soaked
to
the
skin
how
ever
in
the
world
did
you
come
to
stay
out
when
such
a
storm
threatened
she
said
oh
you
are
dripping
go
quickly
and
change
i
have
laid
your
warm
underwear
on
the
bed
dick
i
kissed
my
wife
and
went
upstairs
to
change
my
dripping
clothes
for
something
more
comfortable
when
i
returned
to
the
morning
room
there
was
a
driftwood
fire
on
the
hearth
and
lys
sat
in
the
chimney
corner
embroidering
catherine
tells
me
that
the
fishing
fleet
from
lorient
is
out
do
you
think
they
are
in
danger
dear
asked
lys
raising
her
blue
eyes
to
mine
as
i
entered
there
is
no
wind
and
there
will
be
no
sea
said
i
looking
out
of
the
window
far
across
the
moor
i
could
see
the
black
cliffs
looming
in
the
mist
how
it
rains
murmured
lys
come
to
the
fire
dick
i
threw
myself
on
the
fur
rug
my
hands
in
my
pockets
my
head
on
lys's
knees
tell
me
a
story
i
said
i
feel
like
a
boy
of
ten
lys
raised
a
finger
to
her
scarlet
lips
i
always
waited
for
her
to
do
that
will
you
be
very
still
then
she
said
still
as
death
death
echoed
a
voice
very
softly
did
you
speak
lys
i
asked
turning
so
that
i
could
see
her
face
no
did
you
dick
who
said
'death'
i
asked
startled
death
echoed
a
voice
softly
i
sprang
up
and
looked
about
lys
rose
too
her
needles
and
embroidery
falling
to
the
floor
she
seemed
about
to
faint
leaning
heavily
on
me
and
i
led
her
to
the
window
and
opened
it
a
little
way
to
give
her
air
as
i
did
so
the
chain
lightning
split
the
zenith
the
thunder
crashed
and
a
sheet
of
rain
swept
into
the
room
driving
with
it
something
that
fluttered--something
that
flapped
and
squeaked
and
beat
upon
the
rug
with
soft
moist
wings
we
bent
over
it
together
lys
clinging
to
me
and
we
saw
that
it
was
a
death's-head
moth
drenched
with
rain
the
dark
day
passed
slowly
as
we
sat
beside
the
fire
hand
in
hand
her
head
against
my
breast
speaking
of
sorrow
and
mystery
and
death
for
lys
believed
that
there
were
things
on
earth
that
none
might
understand
things
that
must
be
nameless
forever
and
ever
until
god
rolls
up
the
scroll
of
life
and
all
is
ended
we
spoke
of
hope
and
fear
and
faith
and
the
mystery
of
the
saints
we
spoke
of
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
shadow
of
sin
of
omens
and
of
love
the
moth
still
lay
on
the
floor
quivering
its
sombre
wings
in
the
warmth
of
the
fire
the
skull
and
ribs
clearly
etched
upon
its
neck
and
body
if
it
is
a
messenger
of
death
to
this
house
i
said
why
should
we
fear
lys
death
should
be
welcome
to
those
who
love
god
murmured
lys
and
she
drew
the
cross
from
her
breast
and
kissed
it
the
moth
might
die
if
i
threw
it
out
into
the
storm
i
said
after
a
silence
let
it
remain
sighed
lys
late
that
night
my
wife
lay
sleeping
and
i
sat
beside
her
bed
and
read
in
the
chronicle
of
jacques
sorgue
i
shaded
the
candle
but
lys
grew
restless
and
finally
i
took
the
book
down
into
the
morning
room
where
the
ashes
of
the
fire
rustled
and
whitened
on
the
hearth
the
death's-head
moth
lay
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
where
i
had
left
it
at
first
i
thought
it
was
dead
but
when
i
looked
closer
i
saw
a
lambent
fire
in
its
amber
eyes
the
straight
white
shadow
it
cast
across
the
floor
wavered
as
the
candle
flickered
the
pages
of
the
chronicle
of
jacques
sorgue
were
damp
and
sticky
the
illuminated
gold
and
blue
initials
left
flakes
of
azure
and
gilt
where
my
hand
brushed
them
it
is
not
paper
at
all
it
is
thin
parchment
i
said
to
myself
and
i
held
the
discoloured
page
close
to
the
candle
flame
and
read
translating
laboriously
i
jacques
sorgue
saw
all
these
things
and
i
saw
the
black
mass
celebrated
in
the
chapel
of
st
gildas-on-the-cliff
and
it
was
said
by
the
abbã©
sorgue
my
kinsman
for
which
deadly
sin
the
apostate
priest
was
seized
by
the
most
noble
marquis
of
plougastel
and
by
him
condemned
to
be
burned
with
hot
irons
until
his
seared
soul
quit
its
body
and
fly
to
its
master
the
devil
but
when
the
black
priest
lay
in
the
crypt
of
plougastel
his
master
satan
came
at
night
and
set
him
free
and
carried
him
across
land
and
sea
to
mahmoud
which
is
soldan
or
saladin
and
i
jacques
sorgue
travelling
afterward
by
sea
beheld
with
my
own
eyes
my
kinsman
the
black
priest
of
st
gildas
borne
along
in
the
air
upon
a
vast
black
wing
which
was
the
wing
of
his
master
satan
and
this
was
seen
also
by
two
men
of
the
crew
i
turned
the
page
the
wings
of
the
moth
on
the
floor
began
to
quiver
i
read
on
and
on
my
eyes
blurring
under
the
shifting
candle
flame
i
read
of
battles
and
of
saints
and
i
learned
how
the
great
soldan
made
his
pact
with
satan
and
then
i
came
to
the
sieur
de
trevec
and
read
how
he
seized
the
black
priest
in
the
midst
of
saladin's
tents
and
carried
him
away
and
cut
off
his
head
first
branding
him
on
the
forehead
and
before
he
suffered
said
the
chronicle
he
cursed
the
sieur
de
trevec
and
his
descendants
and
he
said
he
would
surely
return
to
st
gildas
'for
the
violence
you
do
to
me
i
will
do
violence
to
you
for
the
evil
i
suffer
at
your
hands
i
will
work
evil
on
you
and
your
descendants
woe
to
your
children
sieur
de
trevec'
there
was
a
whirr
a
beating
of
strong
wings
and
my
candle
flashed
up
as
in
a
sudden
breeze
a
humming
filled
the
room
the
great
moth
darted
hither
and
thither
beating
buzzing
on
ceiling
and
wall
i
flung
down
my
book
and
stepped
forward
now
it
lay
fluttering
upon
the
window
sill
and
for
a
moment
i
had
it
under
my
hand
but
the
thing
squeaked
and
i
shrank
back
then
suddenly
it
darted
across
the
candle
flame
the
light
flared
and
went
out
and
at
the
same
moment
a
shadow
moved
in
the
darkness
outside
i
raised
my
eyes
to
the
window
a
masked
face
was
peering
in
at
me
quick
as
thought
i
whipped
out
my
revolver
and
fired
every
cartridge
but
the
face
advanced
beyond
the
window
the
glass
melting
away
before
it
like
mist
and
through
the
smoke
of
my
revolver
i
saw
something
creep
swiftly
into
the
room
then
i
tried
to
cry
out
but
the
thing
was
at
my
throat
and
i
fell
backward
among
the
ashes
of
the
hearth





when
my
eyes
unclosed
i
was
lying
on
the
hearth
my
head
among
the
cold
ashes
slowly
i
got
on
my
knees
rose
painfully
and
groped
my
way
to
a
chair
on
the
floor
lay
my
revolver
shining
in
the
pale
light
of
early
morning
my
mind
clearing
by
degrees
i
looked
shuddering
at
the
window
the
glass
was
unbroken
i
stooped
stiffly
picked
up
my
revolver
and
opened
the
cylinder
every
cartridge
had
been
fired
mechanically
i
closed
the
cylinder
and
placed
the
revolver
in
my
pocket
the
book
the
chronicles
of
jacques
sorgue
lay
on
the
table
beside
me
and
as
i
started
to
close
it
i
glanced
at
the
page
it
was
all
splashed
with
rain
and
the
lettering
had
run
so
that
the
page
was
merely
a
confused
blur
of
gold
and
red
and
black
as
i
stumbled
toward
the
door
i
cast
a
fearful
glance
over
my
shoulder
the
death's-head
moth
crawled
shivering
on
the
rug
iv
the
sun
was
about
three
hours
high
i
must
have
slept
for
i
was
aroused
by
the
sudden
gallop
of
horses
under
our
window
people
were
shouting
and
calling
in
the
road
i
sprang
up
and
opened
the
sash
le
bihan
was
there
an
image
of
helplessness
and
max
fortin
stood
beside
him
polishing
his
glasses
some
gendarmes
had
just
arrived
from
quimperlã©
and
i
could
hear
them
around
the
corner
of
the
house
stamping
and
rattling
their
sabres
and
carbines
as
they
led
their
horses
into
my
stable
lys
sat
up
murmuring
half-sleepy
half-anxious
questions
i
don't
know
i
answered
i
am
going
out
to
see
what
it
means
it
is
like
the
day
they
came
to
arrest
you
lys
said
giving
me
a
troubled
look
but
i
kissed
her
and
laughed
at
her
until
she
smiled
too
then
i
flung
on
coat
and
cap
and
hurried
down
the
stairs
the
first
person
i
saw
standing
in
the
road
was
the
brigadier
durand
hello
said
i
have
you
come
to
arrest
me
again
what
the
devil
is
all
this
fuss
about
anyway
we
were
telegraphed
for
an
hour
ago
said
durand
briskly
and
for
a
sufficient
reason
i
think
look
there
monsieur
darrel
he
pointed
to
the
ground
almost
under
my
feet
good
heavens
i
cried
where
did
that
puddle
of
blood
come
from
that's
what
i
want
to
know
monsieur
darrel
max
fortin
found
it
at
daybreak
see
it's
splashed
all
over
the
grass
too
a
trail
of
it
leads
into
your
garden
across
the
flower
beds
to
your
very
window
the
one
that
opens
from
the
morning
room
there
is
another
trail
leading
from
this
spot
across
the
road
to
the
cliffs
then
to
the
gravel
pit
and
thence
across
the
moor
to
the
forest
of
kerselec
we
are
going
to
mount
in
a
minute
and
search
the
bosquets
will
you
join
us
bon
dieu
but
the
fellow
bled
like
an
ox
max
fortin
says
it's
human
blood
or
i
should
not
have
believed
it
the
little
chemist
of
quimperlã©
came
up
at
that
moment
rubbing
his
glasses
with
a
coloured
handkerchief
yes
it
is
human
blood
he
said
but
one
thing
puzzles
me
the
corpuscles
are
yellow
i
never
saw
any
human
blood
before
with
yellow
corpuscles
but
your
english
doctor
thompson
asserts
that
he
has----
well
it's
human
blood
anyway--isn't
it
insisted
durand
impatiently
ye-es
admitted
max
fortin
then
it's
my
business
to
trail
it
said
the
big
gendarme
and
he
called
his
men
and
gave
the
order
to
mount
did
you
hear
anything
last
night
asked
durand
of
me
i
heard
the
rain
i
wonder
the
rain
did
not
wash
away
these
traces
they
must
have
come
after
the
rain
ceased
see
this
thick
splash
how
it
lies
over
and
weighs
down
the
wet
grass
blades
pah
it
was
a
heavy
evil-looking
clot
and
i
stepped
back
from
it
my
throat
closing
in
disgust
my
theory
said
the
brigadier
is
this
some
of
those
biribi
fishermen
probably
the
icelanders
got
an
extra
glass
of
cognac
into
their
hides
and
quarrelled
on
the
road
some
of
them
were
slashed
and
staggered
to
your
house
but
there
is
only
one
trail
and
yet--and
yet
how
could
all
that
blood
come
from
only
one
person
well
the
wounded
man
let
us
say
staggered
first
to
your
house
and
then
back
here
and
he
wandered
off
drunk
and
dying
god
knows
where
that's
my
theory
a
very
good
one
said
i
calmly
and
you
are
going
to
trail
him
yes
when
at
once
will
you
come
not
now
i'll
gallop
over
by-and-bye
you
are
going
to
the
edge
of
the
kerselec
forest
yes
you
will
hear
us
calling
are
you
coming
max
fortin
and
you
le
bihan
good
take
the
dog-cart
the
big
gendarme
tramped
around
the
corner
to
the
stable
and
presently
returned
mounted
on
a
strong
gray
horse
his
sabre
shone
on
his
saddle
his
pale
yellow
and
white
facings
were
spotless
the
little
crowd
of
white-coiffed
women
with
their
children
fell
back
as
durand
touched
spurs
and
clattered
away
followed
by
his
two
troopers
soon
after
le
bihan
and
max
fortin
also
departed
in
the
mayor's
dingy
dog-cart
are
you
coming
piped
le
bihan
shrilly
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
replied
and
went
back
to
the
house
when
i
opened
the
door
of
the
morning
room
the
death's-head
moth
was
beating
its
strong
wings
against
the
window
for
a
second
i
hesitated
then
walked
over
and
opened
the
sash
the
creature
fluttered
out
whirred
over
the
flower
beds
a
moment
then
darted
across
the
moorland
toward
the
sea
i
called
the
servants
together
and
questioned
them
josephine
catherine
jean
marie
tregunc
not
one
of
them
had
heard
the
slightest
disturbance
during
the
night
then
i
told
jean
marie
to
saddle
my
horse
and
while
i
was
speaking
lys
came
down
dearest
i
began
going
to
her
you
must
tell
me
everything
you
know
dick
she
interrupted
looking
me
earnestly
in
the
face
but
there
is
nothing
to
tell--only
a
drunken
brawl
and
some
one
wounded
and
you
are
going
to
ride--where
dick
well
over
to
the
edge
of
kerselec
forest
durand
and
the
mayor
and
max
fortin
have
gone
on
following
a--a
trail
what
trail
some
blood
where
did
they
find
it
out
in
the
road
there
lys
crossed
herself
does
it
come
near
our
house
yes
how
near
it
comes
up
to
the
morning-room
window
said
i
giving
in
her
hand
on
my
arm
grew
heavy
i
dreamed
last
night----
so
did
i----
but
i
thought
of
the
empty
cartridges
in
my
revolver
and
stopped
i
dreamed
that
you
were
in
great
danger
and
i
could
not
move
hand
or
foot
to
save
you
but
you
had
your
revolver
and
i
called
out
to
you
to
fire----
i
did
fire
i
cried
excitedly
you--you
fired
i
took
her
in
my
arms
my
darling
i
said
something
strange
has
happened--something
that
i
can
not
understand
as
yet
but
of
course
there
is
an
explanation
last
night
i
thought
i
fired
at
the
black
priest
ah
gasped
lys
is
that
what
you
dreamed
yes
yes
that
was
it
i
begged
you
to
fire----
and
i
did
her
heart
was
beating
against
my
breast
i
held
her
close
in
silence
dick
she
said
at
length
perhaps
you
killed
the--the
thing
if
it
was
human
i
did
not
miss
i
answered
grimly
and
it
was
human
i
went
on
pulling
myself
together
ashamed
of
having
so
nearly
gone
to
pieces
of
course
it
was
human
the
whole
affair
is
plain
enough
not
a
drunken
brawl
as
durand
thinks
it
was
a
drunken
lout's
practical
joke
for
which
he
has
suffered
i
suppose
i
must
have
filled
him
pretty
full
of
bullets
and
he
has
crawled
away
to
die
in
kerselec
forest
it's
a
terrible
affair
i'm
sorry
i
fired
so
hastily
but
that
idiot
le
bihan
and
max
fortin
have
been
working
on
my
nerves
till
i
am
as
hysterical
as
a
schoolgirl
i
ended
angrily
you
fired--but
the
window
glass
was
not
shattered
said
lys
in
a
low
voice
well
the
window
was
open
then
and
as
for
the--the
rest--i've
got
nervous
indigestion
and
a
doctor
will
settle
the
black
priest
for
me
lys
i
glanced
out
of
the
window
at
tregunc
waiting
with
my
horse
at
the
gate
dearest
i
think
i
had
better
go
to
join
durand
and
the
others
i
will
go
too
oh
no
yes
dick
don't
lys
i
shall
suffer
every
moment
you
are
away
the
ride
is
too
fatiguing
and
we
can't
tell
what
unpleasant
sight
you
may
come
upon
lys
you
don't
really
think
there
is
anything
supernatural
in
this
affair
dick
she
answered
gently
i
am
a
bretonne
with
both
arms
around
my
neck
my
wife
said
death
is
the
gift
of
god
i
do
not
fear
it
when
we
are
together
but
alone--oh
my
husband
i
should
fear
a
god
who
could
take
you
away
from
me
we
kissed
each
other
soberly
simply
like
two
children
then
lys
hurried
away
to
change
her
gown
and
i
paced
up
and
down
the
garden
waiting
for
her
she
came
drawing
on
her
slender
gauntlets
i
swung
her
into
the
saddle
gave
a
hasty
order
to
jean
marie
and
mounted
now
to
quail
under
thoughts
of
terror
on
a
morning
like
this
with
lys
in
the
saddle
beside
me
no
matter
what
had
happened
or
might
happen
was
impossible
moreover
mã´me
came
sneaking
after
us
i
asked
tregunc
to
catch
him
for
i
was
afraid
he
might
be
brained
by
our
horses'
hoofs
if
he
followed
but
the
wily
puppy
dodged
and
bolted
after
lys
who
was
trotting
along
the
high-road
never
mind
i
thought
if
he's
hit
he'll
live
for
he
has
no
brains
to
lose
lys
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
road
beside
the
shrine
of
our
lady
of
st
gildas
when
i
joined
her
she
crossed
herself
i
doffed
my
cap
then
we
shook
out
our
bridles
and
galloped
toward
the
forest
of
kerselec
we
said
very
little
as
we
rode
i
always
loved
to
watch
lys
in
the
saddle
her
exquisite
figure
and
lovely
face
were
the
incarnation
of
youth
and
grace
her
curling
hair
glistened
like
threaded
gold
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
saw
the
spoiled
puppy
mã´me
come
bounding
cheerfully
alongside
oblivious
of
our
horses'
heels
our
road
swung
close
to
the
cliffs
a
filthy
cormorant
rose
from
the
black
rocks
and
flapped
heavily
across
our
path
lys's
horse
reared
but
she
pulled
him
down
and
pointed
at
the
bird
with
her
riding
crop
i
see
said
i
it
seems
to
be
going
our
way
curious
to
see
a
cormorant
in
a
forest
isn't
it
it
is
a
bad
sign
said
lys
you
know
the
morbihan
proverb
'when
the
cormorant
turns
from
the
sea
death
laughs
in
the
forest
and
wise
woodsmen
build
boats'
i
wish
said
i
sincerely
that
there
were
fewer
proverbs
in
brittany
we
were
in
sight
of
the
forest
now
across
the
gorse
i
could
see
the
sparkle
of
gendarmes'
trappings
and
the
glitter
of
le
bihan's
silver-buttoned
jacket
the
hedge
was
low
and
we
took
it
without
difficulty
and
trotted
across
the
moor
to
where
le
bihan
and
durand
stood
gesticulating
they
bowed
ceremoniously
to
lys
as
we
rode
up
the
trail
is
horrible--it
is
a
river
said
the
mayor
in
his
squeaky
voice
monsieur
darrel
i
think
perhaps
madame
would
scarcely
care
to
come
any
nearer
lys
drew
bridle
and
looked
at
me
it
is
horrible
said
durand
walking
up
beside
me
it
looks
as
though
a
bleeding
regiment
had
passed
this
way
the
trail
winds
and
winds
about
there
in
the
thickets
we
lose
it
at
times
but
we
always
find
it
again
i
can't
understand
how
one
man--no
nor
twenty--could
bleed
like
that
a
halloo
answered
by
another
sounded
from
the
depths
of
the
forest
it's
my
men
they
are
following
the
trail
muttered
the
brigadier
god
alone
knows
what
is
at
the
end
shall
we
gallop
back
lys
i
asked
no
let
us
ride
along
the
western
edge
of
the
woods
and
dismount
the
sun
is
so
hot
now
and
i
should
like
to
rest
for
a
moment
she
said
the
western
forest
is
clear
of
anything
disagreeable
said
durand
very
well
i
answered
call
me
le
bihan
if
you
find
anything
lys
wheeled
her
mare
and
i
followed
across
the
springy
heather
mã´me
trotting
cheerfully
in
the
rear
we
entered
the
sunny
woods
about
a
quarter
of
a
kilometre
from
where
we
left
durand
i
took
lys
from
her
horse
flung
both
bridles
over
a
limb
and
giving
my
wife
my
arm
aided
her
to
a
flat
mossy
rock
which
overhung
a
shallow
brook
gurgling
among
the
beech
trees
lys
sat
down
and
drew
off
her
gauntlets
mã´me
pushed
his
head
into
her
lap
received
an
undeserved
caress
and
came
doubtfully
toward
me
i
was
weak
enough
to
condone
his
offence
but
i
made
him
lie
down
at
my
feet
greatly
to
his
disgust
i
rested
my
head
on
lys's
knees
looking
up
at
the
sky
through
the
crossed
branches
of
the
trees
i
suppose
i
have
killed
him
i
said
it
shocks
me
terribly
lys
you
could
not
have
known
dear
he
may
have
been
a
robber
and--if--not----
did--have
you
ever
fired
your
revolver
since
that
day
four
years
ago
when
the
red
admiral's
son
tried
to
kill
you
but
i
know
you
have
not
no
said
i
wondering
it's
a
fact
i
have
not
why
and
don't
you
remember
that
i
asked
you
to
let
me
load
it
for
you
the
day
when
yves
went
off
swearing
to
kill
you
and
his
father
yes
i
do
remember
well
well
i--i
took
the
cartridges
first
to
st
gildas
chapel
and
dipped
them
in
holy
water
you
must
not
laugh
dick
said
lys
gently
laying
her
cool
hands
on
my
lips
laugh
my
darling
overhead
the
october
sky
was
pale
amethyst
and
the
sunlight
burned
like
orange
flame
through
the
yellow
leaves
of
beech
and
oak
gnats
and
midges
danced
and
wavered
overhead
a
spider
dropped
from
a
twig
halfway
to
the
ground
and
hung
suspended
on
the
end
of
his
gossamer
thread
are
you
sleepy
dear
asked
lys
bending
over
me
i
am--a
little
i
scarcely
slept
two
hours
last
night
i
answered
you
may
sleep
if
you
wish
said
lys
and
touched
my
eyes
caressingly
is
my
head
heavy
on
your
knees
no
dick
i
was
already
in
a
half
doze
still
i
heard
the
brook
babbling
under
the
beeches
and
the
humming
of
forest
flies
overhead
presently
even
these
were
stilled
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
sitting
bolt
upright
my
ears
ringing
with
a
scream
and
i
saw
lys
cowering
beside
me
covering
her
white
face
with
both
hands
as
i
sprang
to
my
feet
she
cried
again
and
clung
to
my
knees
i
saw
my
dog
rush
growling
into
a
thicket
then
i
heard
him
whimper
and
he
came
backing
out
whining
ears
flat
tail
down
i
stooped
and
disengaged
lys's
hand
don't
go
dick
she
cried
o
god
it's
the
black
priest
in
a
moment
i
had
leaped
across
the
brook
and
pushed
my
way
into
the
thicket
it
was
empty
i
stared
about
me
i
scanned
every
tree
trunk
every
bush
suddenly
i
saw
him
he
was
seated
on
a
fallen
log
his
head
resting
in
his
hands
his
rusty
black
robe
gathered
around
him
for
a
moment
my
hair
stirred
under
my
cap
sweat
started
on
forehead
and
cheek-bone
then
i
recovered
my
reason
and
understood
that
the
man
was
human
and
was
probably
wounded
to
death
ay
to
death
for
there
at
my
feet
lay
the
wet
trail
of
blood
over
leaves
and
stones
down
into
the
little
hollow
across
to
the
figure
in
black
resting
silently
under
the
trees
i
saw
that
he
could
not
escape
even
if
he
had
the
strength
for
before
him
almost
at
his
very
feet
lay
a
deep
shining
swamp
as
i
stepped
forward
my
foot
broke
a
twig
at
the
sound
the
figure
started
a
little
then
its
head
fell
forward
again
its
face
was
masked
walking
up
to
the
man
i
bade
him
tell
where
he
was
wounded
durand
and
the
others
broke
through
the
thicket
at
the
same
moment
and
hurried
to
my
side
who
are
you
who
hide
a
masked
face
in
a
priest's
robe
said
the
gendarme
loudly
there
was
no
answer
see--see
the
stiff
blood
all
over
his
robe
muttered
le
bihan
to
fortin
he
will
not
speak
said
i
he
may
be
too
badly
wounded
whispered
le
bihan
i
saw
him
raise
his
head
i
said
my
wife
saw
him
creep
up
here
durand
stepped
forward
and
touched
the
figure
speak
he
said
speak
quavered
fortin
durand
waited
a
moment
then
with
a
sudden
upward
movement
he
stripped
off
the
mask
and
threw
back
the
man's
head
we
were
looking
into
the
eye
sockets
of
a
skull
durand
stood
rigid
the
mayor
shrieked
the
skeleton
burst
out
from
its
rotting
robes
and
collapsed
on
the
ground
before
us
from
between
the
staring
ribs
and
the
grinning
teeth
spurted
a
torrent
of
black
blood
showering
the
shrinking
grasses
then
the
thing
shuddered
and
fell
over
into
the
black
ooze
of
the
bog
little
bubbles
of
iridescent
air
appeared
from
the
mud
the
bones
were
slowly
engulfed
and
as
the
last
fragments
sank
out
of
sight
up
from
the
depths
and
along
the
bank
crept
a
creature
shiny
shivering
quivering
its
wings
it
was
a
death's-head
moth





i
wish
i
had
time
to
tell
you
how
lys
outgrew
superstitions--for
she
never
knew
the
truth
about
the
affair
and
she
never
will
know
since
she
has
promised
not
to
read
this
book
i
wish
i
might
tell
you
about
the
king
and
his
coronation
and
how
the
coronation
robe
fitted
i
wish
that
i
were
able
to
write
how
yvonne
and
herbert
stuart
rode
to
a
boar
hunt
in
quimperlã©
and
how
the
hounds
raced
the
quarry
right
through
the
town
overturning
three
gendarmes
the
notary
and
an
old
woman
but
i
am
becoming
garrulous
and
lys
is
calling
me
to
come
and
hear
the
king
say
that
he
is
sleepy
and
his
highness
shall
not
be
kept
waiting

with

clear
your

from

i
three
great
hulking
cousins
said
she
closing
her
gray
eyes
disdainfully
we
accepted
the
rebuke
in
astonished
silence
presently
she
opened
her
eyes
and
seemed
surprised
to
see
us
there
yet
o
she
said
if
you
think
i
am
going
to
stay
here
until
you
make
up
your
minds----
i've
made
up
mine
said
donald
we
will
go
to
the
links
you
may
come
i
shall
not
she
announced
walter
what
do
you
propose
walter
looked
at
his
cartridge
belt
and
then
at
the
little
breech-loader
standing
in
a
corner
of
the
arbour
oh
i
know
she
said
but
i
won't
i
won't
i
won't
the
uncles
and
aunts
on
the
piazza
turned
to
look
at
us
her
mother
arose
from
a
steamer-chair
and
came
across
the
lawn
won't
what
sweetheart
she
asked
placing
both
hands
on
her
daughter's
shoulders
mamma
walter
wants
me
to
shoot
and
don
wants
me
to
play
golf
and
i--won't
she
doesn't
know
what
she
wants
said
i
don't
i
she
said
flushing
with
displeasure
her
mother
might
suggest
something
hazarded
donald
we
looked
at
our
aunt
sweetheart
is
spoiled
said
that
lady
decisively
if
you
children
don't
go
away
at
once
and
have
a
good
time
i
shall
find
employment
for
her
algebra
i
asked
maliciously
how
dare
you
cried
sweetheart
sitting
up
oh
isn't
he
mean
isn't
he
ignoble--and
i've
done
my
algebra
haven't
i
mamma
but
your
french
i
began
donald
laughed
and
so
did
walter
as
for
sweetheart
she
arose
in
all
the
dignity
of
sixteen
years
closed
her
eyes
with
superb
insolence
and
clasping
her
mother's
waist
with
one
round
white
arm
marched
out
of
the
arbour
we
tease
her
too
much
said
donald
she's
growing
up
fast
we
ought
not
to
call
her
'sweetheart'
when
she
puts
her
hair
up
added
walter
she's
going
to
put
it
up
in
october
when
she
goes
back
to
school
said
donald
jack
she
will
hate
you
if
you
keep
reminding
her
of
her
algebra
and
french
then
i'll
stop
said
i
suddenly
conscious
what
an
awful
thing
it
would
be
if
she
hated
me
donald's
two
pointers
came
frisking
across
the
lawn
from
the
kennels
and
donald
picked
up
his
gun
here
we
go
again
said
i
donny's
going
to
the
coverts
after
grouse
walter's
going
up
on
the
hill
with
his
dust-shot
and
arsenic
and
i'm
going
across
the
fields
after
butterflies
why
the
deuce
can't
we
all
go
together
just
for
once
and
take
sweetheart
she
would
like
it
if
we
all
went
together
said
walter
she
is
tired
of
seeing
jack
net
butterflies
collecting
birds
and
shooting
grouse
are
two
different
things
began
donald
you
spoil
my
dogs
by
shooting
your
confounded
owls
and
humming
birds
oh
your
precious
dogs
i
cried
shut
up
donny
and
give
sweetheart
a
good
day's
tramp
it's
a
pity
if
three
cousins
can't
pool
their
pleasures
for
once
donald
nodded
uncertainly
come
on
said
walter
we'll
find
sweetheart
jack
you
get
your
butterfly
togs
and
come
back
here
i
nodded
and
watched
my
two
cousins
sauntering
across
the
lawn--big
clean-cut
fellows
resembling
each
other
enough
to
be
brothers
instead
of
cousins
we
all
resembled
each
other
more
or
less
donald
walter
and
i
as
for
sweetheart
she
looked
like
none
of
us
it
was
all
very
well
for
her
mother
to
call
her
sweetheart
and
for
her
aunts
to
echo
it
in
chorus
but
the
time
was
coming
when
we
saw
we
should
have
to
stop
a
girl
of
sixteen
with
such
a
name
is
ridiculous
and
sweetheart
was
nearly
seventeen
and
her
hair
was
going
up
and
her
gowns
were
coming
down
in
october
her
own
name
was
pretty
enough
i
don't
know
that
i
ought
to
tell
it
but
i
will
it
was
the
same
as
her
mother's
we
called
her
sweetheart
sometimes
sometimes
the
aspen
beauty
donald
had
given
her
that
name
from
a
butterfly
in
my
collection
the
vanessa
pandora
commonly
known
as
the
aspen
beauty
from
its
never
having
been
captured
in
america
except
in
our
village
of
aspen
here
in
the
north
of
new
york
state
we
four
cousins
spent
our
summers
in
the
family
house
there
was
not
much
to
do
in
aspen
we
used
the
links
we
galloped
over
the
sandy
roads
we
also
trotted
our
several
hobbies
donald
walter
and
i
sweetheart
had
no
hobby
to
make
up
for
this
however
she
owned
a
magnificent
team
of
bãªtes-noires--algebra
and
french
as
for
me
my
butterfly
collection
languished
i
had
specimens
of
nearly
every
butterfly
in
new
york
state
and
i
rather
longed
for
new
states
to
conquer
anyway
there
were
plenty
of
aspen
beauties--i
mean
the
butterflies--flying
about
the
roads
and
balm-of-gilead
trees
and
perhaps
that
is
why
i
lingered
there
long
enough
to
collect
hundreds
of
duplicates
for
exchange
and
perhaps
it
wasn't
i
thought
of
these
things
as
i
sat
in
the
sun-flecked
arbour
watching
the
yellow
elm
leaves
flutter
down
from
the
branches
i
thought
too
of
sweetheart
and
wondered
how
she
would
look
with
her
hair
up
and
while
i
sat
there
smoking
watching
the
yellow
leaves
drifting
across
the
lawn
a
sharp
explosion
startled
me
and
i
raised
my
head
sweetheart
was
standing
on
the
lawn
gazing
dreamily
at
the
smoking
dã©bris
of
a
large
firecracker
what's
that
for
i
asked
it
proclaims
my
independence
said
sweetheart--my
independence
forever
hereafter
my
cousins
will
ask
to
accompany
me
on
my
walks
they
need
no
longer
charitably
permit
me
to
accompany
them
are
you
three
boys
going
to
ride
your
hobbies
we
are
i
said
then
good-bye
i
am
going
to
walk
can't
we
come
too
i
asked
laughing
oh
she
said
graciously
if
you
put
it
in
that
way
i
could
not
refuse
may
we
bring
our
guns
asked
donald
from
the
piazza
may
i
bring
my
net
i
added
half
amused
half
annoyed
she
made
a
gesture
indifferent
condescending
dear
me
murmured
the
aunts
in
chorus
from
the
piazza
as
we
trooped
after
the
aspen
beauty
sweetheart
is
growing
very
fast
i
smiled
vaguely
at
sweetheart
i
was
wondering
how
she
would
look
in
long
frocks
and
coiled
hair
ii
in
the
fall
of
the
year
the
meadows
of
aspen
glimmer
in
the
sunlight
like
crumpled
sheets
of
beaten
gold
for
aspen
is
the
land
of
golden-rod
of
yellow
earth
and
gilded
fern
there
the
crisp
oaks
rustle
every
leaf
a
blot
of
yellow
there
the
burnished
pines
sound
sound
tremble
and
resound
like
gilt-stringed
harps
aquiver
in
the
wind
sweet
fern
sun-dried
bronzed
fills
all
the
hills
with
incense
vague
and
delicate
as
the
white
down
drifting
from
the
frothy
milkweed
and
where
the
meadow
brook
prattled
limpid
filtered
with
sunlight
sweetheart
stood
knee-deep
in
fragrant
mint
watching
the
aimless
minnows
swimming
in
circles
on
a
distant
hill
dark
against
the
blue
donald
moved
with
his
dogs
and
i
saw
the
sun-glint
on
his
gun
and
i
heard
the
distant
hi--on
hi--on
long
after
he
disappeared
below
the
brown
hill's
brow
walter
too
had
gone
leaving
us
there
by
the
brook
together
sweetheart
and
i
and
i
saw
the
crows
flapping
and
circling
far
over
the
woods
and
i
heard
the
soft
report
of
his
dust-shot
shells
among
the
trees
the
ruling
passion
sweetheart
i
said
donny
chases
the
phantom
of
pleasure
with
his
dogs
the
phantom
flies
from
walter
and
he
follows
with
his
dust-shot
then
said
sweetheart
follow
your
phantom
also
there
are
butterflies
everywhere
she
raised
both
arms
and
turned
from
the
brook
everywhere
flying
i
see
butterflies--phantoms
of
pleasure
and
jack
you
do
not
follow
with
your
net
no
said
i
the
world
to-day
is
too
fair
to--slay
in
i
even
doubt
that
the
happiness
of
empires
hinges
on
the
discovery
of
a
new
species
of
anything
do
i
bore
you
a
little
said
sweetheart
touching
the
powdered
gold
of
the
blossoms
about
her
she
laid
the
tip
of
her
third
finger
on
her
lips
and
then
on
the
golden-rod
i
shall
not
pick
it
the
world
is
too
fair
to-day
she
said
what
are
you
going
to
do
jack
i
could
doze
i
said
could
you
yes--if
you
told
me
stories
i
contemplated
her
in
silence
for
a
moment
after
a
while
she
sat
down
under
an
oak
and
clasped
her
hands
i
am
growing
so
old
she
sighed
i
no
longer
take
pleasure
in
childish
things--donald's
dogs
walter's
humming
birds
your
butterflies
jack
what
sit
down
on
the
grass
what
for
because
i
ask
you
i
sat
down
presently
she
said
i
am
as
tall
as
mamma
why
should
i
study
algebra
because
i
answered
evasively
your
answer
is
as
rude
as
though
i
were
twenty
instead
of
sixteen
said
sweetheart
if
you
treat
me
as
a
child
from
this
moment
i
shall
hate
you
me--sweetheart
and
that
name--it
is
good
for
children
and
kittens
i
looked
at
her
seriously
it
is
good
for
women
too--when
it
is
time
i
said
i
prophesy
that
one
day
you
will
hear
it
again
as
for
me
i
shall
not
call
you
by
that
name
if
you
dislike
it
i
am
a
woman--now
she
said
oh
at
sixteen
to-morrow
i
am
to
be
seventeen
presently
looking
off
at
the
blue
hills
i
said
for
a
long
time
i
have
recognised
that
that
subtle
indefinable
attitude--we
call
it
deference--due
from
men
to
women
is
due
from
us
to
you
donny
and
walter
are
slower
to
accept
this
you
know
what
you
have
been
to
us
as
a
child
we
can't
bear
to
lose
you--to
meet
you
in
another
way--to
reckon
with
you
as
we
reckon
with
a
woman
but
it
is
true
our
little
sweetheart
has
vanished
and--you
are
here
the
oak
leaves
began
to
rustle
in
the
hill
winds
the
crows
cawed
from
the
woods
oui
c'est
moi
she
said
at
length
i
shall
never
call
you
sweetheart
again
i
said
smiling
who
knows
she
laughed
and
leaned
over
to
pick
a
blade
of
wild
wheat
she
coloured
faintly
a
moment
later
and
said
i
didn't
mean
that
jack
and
so
sweetheart
took
her
first
step
across
that
threshold
of
mystery
the
temple
of
idols
and
of
the
gilded
idols
within
the
temple
one
shall
turn
to
living
flesh
at
the
sound
of
a
voice
and
lo
where
a
child
had
entered
a
woman
returned
with
the
key
to
the
temple
of
gilded
idols
jack
said
sweetheart
you
are
wrong
no
day
is
too
fair
to
kill
in
i
shall
pick
my
arms
full--full
of
flowers
over
the
yellow
fields
red
with
the
stalks
of
the
buckwheat
crowned
with
a
glimmering
cloud
of
the
dusty
gold
of
the
golden-rod
sweetheart
passed
pensive
sedate
awed
by
the
burden
of
sixteen
years
i
followed
over
the
curling
fern
and
wind-stirred
grasses
the
silken
milkweed
seeds
sailed
sailed
and
the
great
red-brown
butterflies
drifted
above
ruddy
as
autumn
leaves
aglow
in
the
sun
on
the
sand-cliff
there
are
marigolds
said
sweetheart
i
looked
at
the
mass
of
wild
flowers
in
her
arms
her
white
polished
skin
reflected
the
blaze
of
colour
warming
like
ivory
under
their
glow
marigolds
i
repeated
we
will
get
some
the
sand
slides
on
the
face
of
the
cliff
you
must
be
careful
she
said
and
i
may
see
one
of
those
rare
cliff
butterflies
i
haven't
any
good
examples
i
fancy
she
was
not
listening
the
crows
were
clamouring
above
the
beech
woods
the
hill
winds
filled
our
ears
with
a
sound
like
the
sound
of
the
sea
on
shoals
her
gray
eyes
touched
with
the
sky's
deep
blue
and
the
blue
of
the
misty
hills
looked
out
across
the
miles
of
woods
and
fields
and
saw
a
world
not
a
world
old
scarred
rock-ribbed
and
salt
with
tears
but
a
new
world
youthful
ripe
sunny
hazy
with
the
splendour
of
wonders
hidden
behind
the
horizon--a
world
jewelled
with
gems
spanned
by
rose-mist
rainbows--a
world
of
sixteen
years
we
are
already
at
the
cliff's
edge
i
said
she
stepped
to
the
edge
and
looked
over
i
drew
her
back
the
sand
started
among
the
rocks
running
running
with
a
sound
like
silver
water
then
you
shall
not
go
either
she
said
i
do
not
care
for
marigolds
but
i
was
already
on
the
edge
stooping
for
a
blossom
the
next
instant
i
fell
there
was
a
whistle
of
sand
a
flurry
and
a
rush
of
wind
a
blur
of
rock
fern
dead
grasses--a
cry
for
i
remember
as
i
fell
falling
i
called
sweetheart
and
again
sweetheart
then
my
body
struck
the
rocks
below
iii
of
all
the
seconds
that
tick
the
whole
year
through
of
all
the
seconds
that
have
slipped
onward
marking
the
beat
of
time
since
time
was
loosed
there
is
one
one
brief
moment
steeped
in
magic
and
heavy
with
oblivion
that
sometimes
lingers
in
the
soul
of
man
annihilating
space
and
time
if
at
the
feet
of
god
a
year
is
a
second
passed
unnoted
this
magic
second
afloat
on
the
tide
of
time
moves
on
and
on
till
caught
in
the
vortex
of
some
life's
whirl
it
sinks
into
the
soul
of
a
being
near
to
death
and
in
that
soul
the
magic
second
glows
and
lingers
stretching
into
minutes
hours
days--aye
days
and
days
till
if
the
magic
hold
the
calm
years
crowd
on
one
by
one
and
yet
it
all
is
but
a
second--that
magic
moment
that
comes
on
the
tide
of
time--that
came
to
me
and
was
caught
up
in
my
life's
whirl
as
i
fell
dropping
there
between
sky
and
earth
and
so
that
magic
moment
grew
to
minutes
to
hours
and
when
my
body
whirling
pitching
struck
and
lay
flung
out
on
the
earth
the
magic
second
grew
until
the
crystal
days
fell
from
my
life
as
beads
one
by
one
fall
from
the
rosaries
that
saints
tell
kneeling
those
days
of
a
life
that
i
have
lived
those
years
that
linger
still
aglow
in
the
sun
behind
me
dim
yet
splendid
as
dust-dimmed
jewels
they
also
have
ended
not
in
vague
night
but
in
the
sunburst
of
another
second--such
a
second
as
ticks
from
my
watch
as
i
write
quick
sharp
joyous
irrevocable
so
of
that
magic
second
or
day
or
year
i
shall
tell--i
as
i
was
standing
beside
my
body
flung
there
across
the
earth
i
looked
at
my
body
lying
in
a
heap
then
turned
to
the
sand
cliff
smiling
sweetheart
i
called
but
she
was
already
at
my
side
we
walked
on
through
fragrant
pastures
watching
the
long
shadows
stretch
from
field
to
field
speaking
of
what
had
been
and
of
all
that
was
to
be
it
was
so
simple--everything
was
clear
before
us
had
there
been
doubts
fears
sudden
alarms
startled
heartbeats
if
there
had
been
now
they
were
ended
forever
not
forever
said
sweetheart
who
knows
how
long
the
magic
second
may
last
but
we--what
difference
can
that
make
i
asked
to
us
yes
none
said
sweetheart
decisively
we
looked
out
into
the
west
the
sun
turned
to
a
mound
of
cinders
the
hills
loomed
in
opalescent
steam
but--but--your
shadow
said
sweetheart
i
bent
my
head
thrilled
with
happiness
and
yours
i
whispered
the
shadows
we
cast
were
whiter
than
snow
i
still
heard
the
hill
winds
soft
in
my
ears
as
breaking
surf
a
bird-note
came
from
the
dusky
woodland
a
star
broke
out
overhead
what
is
your
pleasure
sweetheart
now
all
is
said
i
asked
the
world
is
all
so
fair
she
sighed
is
it
fairer
beyond
the
hills
jack
it
is
fair
where
you
pass
by
north
south
and
from
west
to
west
again
in
france
the
poplars
are
as
yellow
as
our
oaks
in
morbihan
the
gorse
gilds
all
the
hills
yellow
as
golden-rod
shall
we
go
but
in
the
spring--let
us
wait
until
spring
where
here
until
spring
it
is
written
that
time
shall
pass
as
a
shadow
across
the
sea
what
is
that
book
there
under
your
feet--that
iron-bound
book
half
embedded
like
a
stone
in
the
grass
i
did
not
see
it
bring
it
to
me
i
raised
the
book
it
left
a
bare
mark
in
the
sod
as
a
stone
that
is
turned
then
holding
it
on
my
knees
i
opened
it
and
sweetheart
leaning
on
my
shoulder
read
the
tall
stars
flared
like
candles
flooding
the
page
with
diamond
light
the
earth
perfumed
with
blossoms
stirred
with
the
vague
vibration
of
countless
sounds
tiny
voices
swaying
breathless
in
the
hidden
surge
of
an
endless
harmony
the
white
shadow
is
the
shadow
of
the
soul
she
read
even
the
winds
were
hushed
as
her
sweet
lips
moved
and
what
shall
make
thee
to
understand
what
hell
is
when
the
sun
shall
be
folded
up
as
a
garment
that
is
laid
away
when
the
stars
fall
and
the
seas
boil
and
when
souls
shall
be
joined
again
to
their
bodies
and
when
the
girl
who
hath
been
buried
alive
shall
be
asked
for
what
crime
when
books
shall
be
laid
open
when
hell
shall
burn
fiercely
and
when
paradise
shall
be
brought
very
near
every
soul
shall
know
what
it
hath
wrought
i
closed
my
eyes
the
splendour
of
the
starlight
on
the
page
was
more
than
my
eyes
could
bear
but
she
read
on
for
what
can
dim
her
eyes
o
man
verily
labouring
thou
labourest
to
meet
thy
lord
and
thou
shalt
meet
him
when
the
earth
shall
be
stretched
like
a
skin
and
shall
cast
forth
that
which
is
therein
by
the
heaven
adorned
with
signs
by
the
witness
and
the
witnessed
by
that
which
appeareth
by
night
by
the
daybreak
and
the
ten
nights--the
ten
nights
the
night
of
al
kadr
is
better
than
a
thousand
months
praise
be
to
god
the
lord
of
all
creatures
the
most
merciful
the
king
of
the
day
of
judgment
thee
do
we
worship
and
of
thee
do
we
beg
assistance
direct
us
in
the
right
way
in
the
way
of
those
to
whom
thou
hast
been
gracious
not
of
those
against
whom
thou
art
incensed
nor
of
those
who
go
astray





in
the
sudden
silence
that
spread
across
earth
and
heaven
i
heard
the
sound
of
a
voice
under
the
earth
calling
calling
calling
it
is
already
spring
said
sweetheart
and
she
rose
placing
her
white
hands
in
mine
shall
we
go
but
we
are
already
there
i
stammered
turning
my
eyes
fearfully
for
the
tall
pines
dwindled
and
clustered
and
rose
again
cool
and
gray
in
the
morning
air
all
turned
to
stone
fretted
and
carved
like
lacework
and
where
the
pines
had
faded
the
twin
towers
of
a
cathedral
loomed
and
where
the
hills
swept
across
the
horizon
the
roofs
of
a
white
city
glimmered
in
the
morning
sun
bridges
and
quays
and
streets
and
domes
and
the
hum
of
traffic
and
rattle
of
arms
and
over
all
the
veil
of
haze
and
the
twin
gray
towers
of
notre
dame
sweetheart
i
faltered
but
we
were
already
in
my
studio
iv
the
studio
had
not
changed
the
sun
flooded
it
sweetheart
sat
in
the
broken
armchair
and
watched
me
struggle
with
the
packing
every
now
and
then
she
made
an
impulsive
movement
toward
the
heap
of
clothes
on
the
floor
which
i
checked
with
a
thanks
i
can
fix
it
all
alone
sweetheart
clifford
seemed
to
extract
amusement
from
it
all
and
said
as
much
to
rowden
who
was
as
usual
ruining
my
zitherine
by
trying
to
play
it
like
a
banjo
elliott
knowing
he
could
be
of
no
use
to
us
had
the
decency
to
sit
outside
the
studio
on
one
of
the
garden
benches
he
appeared
at
intervals
at
the
studio
door
saying
come
along
clifford
they
don't
want
you
messing
about
drop
that
banjo
rowden
or
jack
will
break
your
head
with
it--won't
you
jack
i
said
i
would
but
not
with
the
zitherine
clifford
flatly
refused
to
move
unless
sweetheart
would
take
him
out
into
our
garden
and
show
him
the
solitary
goldfish
which
lurked
in
the
fountain
under
the
almond
trees
but
sweetheart
apparently
fascinated
by
the
mysteries
of
packing
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
clifford's
blandishments
and
rowden's
discords
i
imagined
said
clifford
somewhat
hurt
that
you
would
delight
in
taking
upon
yourself
the
duties
of
a
hostess
i
should
be
pleased
to
believe
that
i
am
not
an
unwelcome
guest
so
should
i
echoed
rowden
i'd
be
pleased
too
what
a
shame
for
you
to
bother
jack
she
said
mr
clifford
shall
go
and
make
some
tea
directly
mr
rowden
you
may
take
a
table
out
by
the
fountain--and
stay
there
clifford
motioning
elliott
to
take
the
other
end
of
the
japanese
table
backed
with
it
through
the
hallway
and
out
to
the
gravel
walk
expostulating
the
sugar
is
there
in
that
tin
box
by
the
model
stand
she
said
when
he
reappeared
and
the
extra
spoons
are
lying
in
a
long
box
on
jack's
big
easel
when
rowden
reluctantly
relinquishing
the
zitherine
followed
clifford
bearing
the
cups
and
alcohol
lamp
i
raised
my
head
and
wiped
the
dust
from
my
forehead
i
believe
i
swore
a
little
in
french
sweetheart
looked
startled
she
knew
more
french
than
i
supposed
she
did
what
is
it
jack
mais--rien
ã§a
m'embãªte--cette
espã¨ce
de
malle----
then
why
won't
you
let
me
help
you
jack
i
can
at
least
put
in
my
gowns
but
i
must
pack
my
colour
box
first
and
the
gun
case
and
the
box
of
reels
and
the
pastel
case
and
our
shooting
boots
and
the
water-colour
box
and
the
cartridge
belt
and
your
golf
shoes
and----
o
dear
said
sweetheart
with
a
shudder
i
stood
up
and
scowled
at
the
trunk
to
look
at
you
jack
murmured
sweetheart
one
might
think
you
unhappy
unhappy
at
the
thought
our
eyes
met
across
the
table
unhappy
i
whispered
then
clifford
came
stumbling
in
wearing
a
pair
of
joseph's
sabots
and
imitating
that
faithful
domestic
in
voice
and
manner
invited
us
to
tea
under
the
lilacs
and
almond
blossoms
in
a
moment
cried
sweetheart
impatiently
go
and
pour
the
tea
clifford
looked
aghast
no
no
he
cried
it's
impossible--i
won't
believe
that
you
two
are
deliberately
getting
rid
of
me
so
you
can
be
alone
to
spoon
and
your
honeymoon
already
a
year
old
and----
sweetheart
frowned
and
tapped
her
foot
clifford
retired
indignant
then
she
raised
her
eyes
to
mine
and
a
delicate
colour
stained
her
cheeks
and
neck
yes
i
said
we
have
been
married
nearly
a
year
sweetheart
we
looked
at
our
white
shadows
on
the
floor
v
sweetheart
sat
under
the
lilac
blossoms
pouring
out
tea
for
clifford
elliott
and
rowden
she
was
gracious
to
clifford
gentle
to
elliott
and
she
took
rowden
under
her
wing
in
the
sweetest
way
possible
to
which
clifford
stated
his
objections
mr
rowden
is
younger
than
you
are
she
said
gravely
monsieur
clifford
i
do
not
wish
you
to
torment
him
rowden's
no
baby
he's
as
old
as
jack
is
and
jack
doesn't
murder
music
i
am
glad
to
see
you
acknowledge
jack's
superiority
in
all
matters
said
sweetheart
with
a
dangerous
smile
i
don't
cried
clifford
laughing
and
i
don't
see
what
you
find
to
care
about
in
a
man
who
clips
his
hair
like
a
gendarme
and
paints
everything
purple
everything
is
purple--if
jack
paints
it
so
said
sweetheart
smiling
at
her
reflected
face
in
the
water
she
stood
at
the
rim
of
the
little
stone
fountain
with
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
back
elliott
and
clifford
were
poking
about
in
the
water
plants
to
dislodge
the
solitary
goldfish
while
rowden
gathered
dewy
clusters
of
lilacs
as
an
offering
there
he
goes
said
elliott
poor
fellow
living
there
all
alone
said
sweetheart
jack
must
leave
word
with
joseph
to
get
him
a
little
lady
fish
to
pay
his
court
to
better
put
in
another
gentleman
fish
then
if
you're
following
nature
said
clifford
with
an
attempt
at
cynicism
which
drew
the
merriest
laugh
from
sweetheart
oh
how
funny
is
monsieur
clifford
when
he
wants
to
be
like
frenchmen
she
murmured
jack
said
elliott
as
i
came
from
the
studio
and
picked
up
a
cup
of
tea
grown
cold
clifford's
doing
the
world-worn
disenchanted
rouã©
and--and
i
fear
he
will
next
make
love
to
me
cried
sweetheart
you'd
better
look
out
jack
said
clifford
darkly
and
pretended
to
sulk
until
sweetheart
sent
him
off
to
buy
the
bonbons
she
would
need
for
the
train
they're
packed
i
said
every
trunk
of
them
sweetheart
was
enchanted
all
my
new
gowns
and
the
shoes
from
rix's--o
jack
you
didn't
forget
the
shoes--and
the
bath
robes--and----
all
packed
i
said
swallowing
the
tea
with
a
wry
face
oh
she
cried
reproachfully
don't
drink
that
here
i
will
have
some
hot
tea
in
a
moment
and
she
ran
over
and
perched
on
the
arm
of
the
garden
bench
while
i
lighted
the
alcohol
lamp
and
then
a
cigarette
rowden
came
up
with
his
offering
of
lilacs
and
she
decorated
each
of
us
with
a
spray
it
was
growing
late
the
long
shadows
fell
across
the
gravel
walks
and
flecked
the
white
walls
of
the
sculptor's
studio
opposite
it's
the
nine-o'clock
train
isn't
it
said
elliott
we
will
meet
you
at
the
station
at
eight-thirty
added
rowden
you
don't
mind
do
you
our
dining
alone
said
sweetheart
shyly
it's
our
last
day--jack's
and
mine--in
the
old
studio
not
the
last
i
hope
said
elliott
sincerely
we
all
sat
silent
for
a
moment
o
paris
paris--how
i
fear
it
murmured
sweetheart
to
me
and
in
the
same
breath
no
no
we
must
love
it
you
and
i
then
elliott
said
aloud
i
suppose
you
have
no
idea
when
you
will
return
no
i
replied
thinking
of
the
magic
second
that
had
become
a
year
and
so
we
dined
alone
sweetheart
and
i
in
the
old
studio
at
half-past
eight
o'clock
the
cab
stood
at
the
gate
with
all
our
traps
piled
on
top
and
joseph
and
his
wife
and
the
two
brats
were
crying
au
revoir
madame
au
revoir
monsieur
we
will
keep
the
studio
well
dusted
bon
voyage
bon
voyage
and
all
of
a
sudden
my
arm
was
caught
by
sweetheart's
little
gloved
hand
and
she
drew
me
back
through
the
long
ivy-covered
alley
to
the
garden
where
the
studio
stood
its
doorway
closed
and
silent
the
hollow
windows
black
and
grim
truly
the
light
had
passed
away
with
the
passing
of
sweetheart
her
hand
slipped
from
my
arm
and
she
went
and
knelt
down
at
the
threshold
and
kissed
it
i
first
knew
happiness
when
i
first
crossed
it
she
said
it
breaks
my
heart
to
leave
it
only
that
magic
second
but
it
seems
years
that
we
have
lived
here
it
was
you
who
brought
happiness
to
it
i
said
good-bye
good-bye
dear
dear
old
studio
she
cried
oh
if
jack
is
always
the
same
to
me
as
he
has
been
here--if
he
will
be
faithful
and
true
in
that
new
home
the
new
home
was
to
be
in
a
strange
land
sweetheart
was
a
little
frightened
but
was
dying
to
go
there
sweetheart
had
never
seen
the
golden
gorse
ablaze
on
the
moors
of
morbihan
vi
i
went
inside
the
brass
railing
and
waited
my
turn
to
buy
the
tickets
when
it
came
i
took
two
first
class
to
quimperlã©
for
it
was
to
be
an
all-night
ride
and
there
was
no
sleeping
car
clifford
had
taken
charge
of
the
baggage
and
i
went
with
him
to
have
it
registered
leaving
sweetheart
with
elliott
and
rowden
all
the
traps
were
there--the
big
trunks
the
big
valises
my
sketching
kit
the
zitherine
in
a
leather
case
two
handbags
a
bundle
of
umbrellas
and
canes
and
a
huge
package
of
canvases
the
toilet
case
and
the
rugs
and
waterproofs
we
took
with
us
into
the
compartment
the
compartment
was
empty
sweetheart
nestled
into
one
corner
and
when
i
had
placed
our
traps
in
the
racks
overhead
i
sat
down
opposite
while
clifford
handed
in
our
sandwiches
a
bottle
of
red
wine
and
sweetheart's
box
of
bonbons
we
didn't
say
much
most
had
been
said
before
starting
clifford
was
more
affected
than
he
cared
to
show--i
know
by
the
way
he
grasped
my
hand
they
are
dear
fellows
every
one
we
did
not
realize
that
we
were
actually
going--going
perhaps
forever
she
laughed
and
chatted
and
made
fun
of
clifford
and
teased
rowden
aided
and
abetted
by
elliott
until
the
starting
gong
clanged
and
a
warning
whistle
sounded
along
the
gaslit
platform
jack
cried
clifford
leaning
in
the
window
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
both
elliott
touched
her
hand
and
wrung
mine
and
rowden
risked
his
neck
to
give
us
both
one
last
cordial
grasp
count
on
me--on
us
cried
clifford
speaking
in
english
if
you
are--troubled
by
what
my
poor
clifford
can
you
with
all
your
gay
courage
turn
back
the
hands
of
the
dials
can
you
with
all
your
warm
devotion
add
one
second
to
the
magic
second
and
make
it
two
the
shadows
we
cast
are
white
the
train
stole
out
into
the
night
and
i
saw
them
grouped
on
the
platform
silhouettes
in
the
glare
of
the
yellow
signals
i
drew
in
my
head
and
shut
the
window
sweetheart's
face
had
grown
very
serious
but
now
she
smiled
across
from
her
corner
aren't
you
coming
over
by
me
jack
vii
we
must
have
been
moving
very
swiftly
for
the
car
rocked
and
trembled
and
it
was
probably
that
which
awoke
me
i
looked
across
at
sweetheart
she
was
lying
on
her
side
one
cheek
resting
on
her
gloved
hand
her
travelling
cap
pushed
back
her
eyes
shut
i
smoothed
away
the
curly
strands
of
hair
which
straggled
across
her
cheeks
and
tucked
another
rug
well
about
her
feet
her
feet
were
small
as
a
child's
i
speak
as
if
she
were
not
a
child
she
was
eighteen
then
the
next
time
i
awoke
we
lay
in
a
long
gaslit
station
some
soldiers
were
disembarking
from
the
forward
carriages
and
a
gendarme
stalked
up
and
down
the
platform
i
looked
sleepily
about
for
the
name
of
the
station
it
was
painted
in
blue
over
the
buffet--petit
st
yves
is
it
possible
we
are
in
brittany
i
thought
then
the
voices
of
the
station
hands
who
were
hoisting
a
small
boat
upon
the
forward
carriage
settled
my
doubts
allons

jean
louis
mets

cannotte
deboutte
arrãªte
toi
yves
doucement
doucement
sacrã©e
garce
somewhere
in
the
darkness
a
mellow
bell
tolled
i
settled
back
to
slumber
my
eyes
on
sweetheart
she
slept
viii
i
awoke
in
a
flood
of
brightest
sunshine
from
our
window
i
could
look
into
the
centre
of
a
most
enchanting
little
town
all
built
of
white
limestone
and
granite
the
june
sunshine
slanted
on
thatched
roof
and
painted
gable
and
fairly
blazed
on
the
little
river
slipping
by
under
the
stone
bridge
in
the
square
the
streets
and
the
square
were
alive
with
rosy-faced
women
in
white
head-dresses
everywhere
the
constant
motion
of
blue
skirts
and
spotless
coiffes
the
twinkle
of
varnished
socks
the
clump
clump
of
sabots
like
a
black
shadow
a
priest
stole
across
the
square
above
him
the
cross
on
the
church
glowed
like
a
live
cinder
flashing
its
reflection
along
the
purple-slated
roof
from
the
eaves
of
which
a
cloud
of
ash-gray
pigeons
drifted
into
the
gutter
below
i
turned
from
the
window
to
encounter
sweetheart's
eyes
her
lips
moved
a
little
her
long
lashes
heavy
with
slumber
drooped
lower
then
with
a
little
sigh
she
sat
bolt
upright
when
i
laughed
as
i
always
did
she
smiled
a
little
confused
a
little
ashamed
murmuring
bonjour
mon
chã©ri
quelle
heure
est-il
that
was
always
the
way
sweetheart
awoke
o
dear
i
am
so
rumpled
she
said
jack
get
me
the
satchel
this
minute
and
don't
look
at
me
until
i
ask
you
to
i
unlocked
the
satchel
and
then
turning
to
the
window
again
threw
it
wide
open
oh
how
sweet
came
the
morning
air
from
the
meadows
some
young
fellows
below
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
were
poking
long
cane
fishing-rods
under
the
arches
of
the
bridge
sweetheart
i
said
over
my
shoulder
i
believe
there
are
trout
in
this
stream
mr
elliott
says
that
whenever
you
see
a
puddle
you
always
say
that
she
replied
what
does
he
know
about
it
i
answered
for
i
am
touchy
on
the
subject
he
doesn't
know
a
catfish
from
a--a
dogfish
neither
do
i
jack
dear
but
i'm
going
to
learn
don't
be
cross
she
had
finished
her
toilet
and
came
over
to
the
window
leaning
out
over
my
shoulder
where
are
we
she
cried
in
startled
wonder
at
the
little
white
town
and
the
acres
of
swaying
clover
oh
jack
is--is
this
the
country
a
man
in
uniform
passing
under
our
window
looked
up
surprised
what
are
you
doing
here
he
demanded
then
seeing
sweetheart
he
took
off
his
gold-laced
cap
and
added
with
a
bow
this
carriage
goes
no
farther
monsieur--madame----
merci
exclaimed
sweetheart
we
wish
to
go
to
quimperlã©
and
we
have
tickets
for
quimperlã©
i
insisted
but
smiled
the
official
this
is
quimperlã©
it
was
true
there
was
the
name
written
over
the
end
of
the
station
and
looking
ahead
i
saw
that
our
car
had
been
detached
and
was
standing
in
stately
seclusion
under
the
freight
shed
how
long
it
had
been
standing
so
heaven
alone
knows
but
they
evidently
had
neglected
to
call
us
and
there
we
were
inhabiting
a
detached
carriage
in
the
heart
of
quimperlã©
i
managed
to
get
a
couple
of
porters
and
presently
we
found
all
our
traps
piled
up
on
the
platform
and
a
lumbering
vehicle
with
a
breton
driver
waiting
to
convey
us
to
the
hotel
which
said
i
to
the
docile
breton
is
the
best
hotel
in
quimperlã©
the
hã´tel
lion
d'or
he
replied
how
do
you
know
i
demanded
because
said
he
mildly
it
is
the
only
hotel
in
quimperlã©
sweetheart
observed
that
this
ought
to
be
convincing
even
to
me
and
she
tormented
me
all
the
way
to
the
square
where
i
got
even
by
pretending
to
be
horrified
at
her
dishevelled
condition
incident
to
a
night's
railway
ride
in
a
stuffy
compartment
don't
jack
people
will
look
at
us
let
'em
oh
this
is
cruel
oh
i'll
pay
you
for
this
and
they
did
look
at
us--or
rather
at
her
for
from
the
time
sweetheart
and
i
had
cast
our
lots
together
i
noticed
that
i
seemed
to
escape
the
observation
of
passers-by
when
i
lived
alone
in
paris
i
attracted
a
fair
share
of
observation
from
the
world
as
it
wagged
on
its
parisian
way
it
was
pleasant
to
meet
a
pretty
girl's
eyes
now
and
then
in
the
throng
which
flowed
through
the
park
and
boulevard
i
really
never
flattered
myself
that
it
was
because
of
my
personal
beauty
but
in
paris
any
young
fellow
who
is
dressed
in
the
manner
of
albion
hatted
and
gloved
in
the
same
style
is
not
entirely
a
cipher
but
now
it
was
not
the
same
by
a
long
shot
sweetheart's
beauty
simply
put
me
in
my
place
as
an
unnoticed
but
perhaps
correct
supplement
to
her
she
knew
she
was
a
beauty
and
was
delighted
when
she
looked
into
her
mirror
nothing
escaped
her
the
soft
hair
threaded
with
sunshine
which
when
loosened
curled
to
her
knees
the
clear
white
forehead
and
straight
brows
the
nose
delicate
and
a
trifle
upturned
the
scarlet
lips
and
fine
cut
chin--she
knew
the
value
of
each
of
these
she
was
pleased
with
the
soft
full
curve
of
her
throat
the
little
ears
and
the
colour
which
came
and
went
in
her
cheeks
but
her
eyes
were
the
first
thing
one
noticed
they
were
the
most
beautiful
gray
eyes
that
ever
opened
under
silken
lashes
she
approved
of
my
telling
her
this
which
duty
i
fulfilled
daily
perhaps
it
may
be
superfluous
to
say
that
we
were
very
much
in
love
did
i
say
were
i
think
that
as
i
am
chanting
the
graces
of
sweetheart
it
might
not
be
amiss
to
say
that
she
is
just
an
inch
shorter
than
i
am
and
that
no
parisienne
carried
a
pretty
gown
with
more
perfection
than
she
did
i
have
seen
gowns
that
looked
like
the
devil
on
the
manikin
but
when
sweetheart
wore
them
they
were
the
astonishment
and
admiration
of
myself
and
i
do
know
when
a
woman
is
well
dressed
though
i
am
an
art
critic
sweetheart
regarded
her
beauty
as
an
intimate
affair
between
ourselves
a
precious
gift
for
our
mutual
benefit
to
be
carefully
treasured
and
petted
her
attitude
toward
the
world
was
unmistakable
the
world
might
look--she
was
indifferent
with
our
intimate
friends
she
was
above
being
flattered
clifford
said
to
me
once
she
carries
her
beauty
as
a
princess
would
carry
the
koh-i-noor--she
knows
she
is
worthy
of
it
and
hopes
it
is
worthy
of
her
we
ought
to
be
so
happy
that
i
am
beautiful
she
would
say
to
me
just
think
supposing
i
were
not
i
used
to
try
to
make
her
believe
that
it
would
have
made
no
difference
oh
not
now
she
would
say
gravely
i
know
that
if
i
lost
it
it
would
be
the
same
to
us
both
now
but
you
can't
make
me
believe
that
at
first
when
you
used
to
lean
over
the
terrace
of
the
luxembourg
and
wait
patiently
for
hours
just
to
see
me
walk
out
of
the
odeon
i
didn't
i
would
always
explain
i
was
there
by
accident
oh
what
a
funny
accident
to
happen
every
day
for
two
months
stop
teasing
of
course
after
the
first
week----
and
what
a
funny
accident
that
i
should
pass
the
same
way
every
day
for
two
months
when
before
i
always
went
by
the
rue
de
seine
there
was
once
such
an
accident
and
such
a
girl
i
never
knew
her
she
is
dead
i
wondered
sometimes
that
sweetheart
knew
and
believed
it
was
she
herself
yet
the
other
woman's
shadow
was
black
sweetheart
had
a
most
peculiar
and
unworldly
habit
of
not
embellishing
facts
she
presently
displayed
it
when
we
arrived
at
the
hã´tel
lion
d'or
jack
said
she
nervously
the
cinders
have
made
your
face
unpleasant
i
am
ashamed
they
may
not
believe
you
are
my
husband
as
monsieur
and
madame
i
said
we
may
have
dirty
faces
and
be
honest
do
you
suppose
they--they
will
believe
it
these
queer
people----
they'd
better
i
said
fiercely
i--i
hadn't
thought
of
that
she
said
you
see
in
our
own
little
place
in
paris
everybody
knew
it
but
here----
i
said
dearest
what
nonsense
and
we
marched
unceremoniously
up
to
the
register
where
i
wrote
our
names
then
with
a
hasty
little
squeeze
of
her
gloved
hand
she
turned
to
the
maid
and
tripped
off
to
inspect
our
quarters
while
i
was
pumping
the
fat-headed
old
proprietor
about
the
trout
fishing
in
the
vicinity
the
maid
returned
with
the
request
that
i
mount
to
the
room
above
i
followed
her
along
the
tiled
passages
and
found
sweetheart
sitting
on
a
trunk
it's
charming
charming
she
said
just
look
at
the
roses
outside
and
the
square
and
the
river
and
oh
jack
the
funny
little
breton
cattle
and
the
old
man
with
knee-breeches
it's
charming
and--here
she
caught
sight
of
the
enraptured
and
fascinated
maid--and
you
are
charming
with
your
red
cheeks
and
white
coiffe
she
said
oh
how
pretty
oh
madame
murmured
the
servant
in
dire
confusion
i
said
dearest
that
will
do
nobody
speaks
of
my
peculiar
charms
and
i
wish
to
be
noticed
the
presence
of
the
maid
prevented
sweetheart
from
making
amends
so
we
told
her
we
were
satisfied
and
we
would
spare
her
life
if
she
prepared
breakfast
in
seventeen
seconds
she
accepted
the
gift
of
existence
with
a
dazed
courtsey
and
vanished
it
was
refreshing
to
get
hold
of
a
sponge
and
cold
water
after
fourteen
hours
in
a
cramped
compartment
hunger
drove
us
to
hurry--a
thing
we
rarely
did
in
the
morning--and
the
way
we
splashed
cold
water
about
would
have
been
fatal
to
any
but
a
tiled
floor
dear
i
said
you
have
not
yet
seen
me
in
my
tyrolese
knickerbockers
and
beautiful
shooting
jacket
you
have
never
beheld
my
legs
clothed
in
tyrolese
stockings
at
twenty
francs
a
pair
the
legs
she
inquired
from
the
depths
of
a
bath
robe
i
ignored
the
question
and
parted
my
hair
with
care
then
i
sat
down
on
the
window
and
whistled
of
course
i
was
ready
first
sweetheart's
hair
had
got
into
a
tangle
and
needed
to
be
all
combed
out
oh
i
know
you
are
impatient
because
you're
whistling
the
chant
du
dã©part
she
said
from
the
door
of
her
toilet
room
as
usual
i
said
i
am
ready
first
if
you
say
that
again----
she
threatened
i
said
it
and
dodged
a
sponge
presently
i
was
requested
to
open
the
trunk
and
select
a
gown
for
her
dear
little
sweetheart
she
loved
to
pretend
that
she
had
so
many
it
needed
long
consultation
to
decide
which
the
dark
blue
i
inquired
don't
you
think
it
is
too
warm
the
pale
blue
then--or
the
pink
and
white
why
not
the
white
with
the
cuffs
ã
l'anglaise
and
the
canoe
hat
i
hauled
it
out
then
of
course
she
changed
her
mind
i
think
the
gray
is
better
for
the
morning
then
i
can
wear
the
big
chip
hat
i
fished
up
the
gray
it
was
light
almost
silvery
and
had
white
spots
on
it
jack
dear
she
said
coming
out
with
her
hair
tucked
up
in
a
knot
drawing
the
bath
robe
up
to
her
chin
with
both
hands
i
think
that
the
white
cloth
would
be
better
and
that
i
can
wear
the
bã©ret
by
this
time
the
trunk
was
in
a
pretty
mess
which
amused
her
but
at
last
i
ferreted
out
the
white
cloth
dress
and
refusing
to
listen
to
further
discussion
sat
down
on
the
window
seat
sweetheart
enjoyed
it
stop
telling
me
to
hurry
she
said
i
can't
if
you
keep
saying
it
all
the
time
after
a
while
she
called
me
to
fasten
her
corsage
which
hooked
with
about
ten
hundred
hooks
along
the
side
and
collar
i
hated
to
do
it
and
my
finger
ends
stung
for
hours
after
but
as
sweetheart
very
rightly
says
when
we
are
rich
enough
to
have
a
maid
you
needn't
i
submitted
with
an
air
which
delighted
her
her
tormenting
thank
you
jack
was
the
last
straw
so
i
calmly
picked
her
up
and
carried
her
out
and
almost
to
the
dining
room
where
i
set
her
down
just
in
time
to
avoid
the
proprietor
and
three
domestics
issuing
from
the
office
sweetheart
was
half
inclined
to
laugh
half
indignant
and
wholly
scandalized
but
she
did
not
dare
say
anything
for
we
were
at
the
dining-room
door
there
were
some
people
there
but
except
for
a
slight
inclination
we
did
not
notice
each
other
we
had
a
small
table
to
ourselves
by
the
rose-bowered
window
we
were
very
hungry
breakfast
began
with
fresh
sardines
just
caught
and
ended
with
little
breton
cakes
and
a
demi-tasse
i
finished
first
i
always
do
because
the
wretched
habit
of
bolting
my
food
contracted
while
studying
under
bouguereau
at
julian's
clings
to
me
yet
oh
i
shall
have
a
merry
time
paying
for
it
when
i
am
forty
i
began
as
usual
to
tease
sweetheart
if
you
continue
to
eat
like
this
dear
you
will
never
be
able
to
wear
your
new
frocks
this
one
seems
a
trifle
too
tight
now
sweetheart
who
prided
herself
as
much
on
her
figure
as
on
her
lovely
face
repelled
the
insult
with
disdain
and
nibbled
her
breton
biscuit
defiantly
when
at
last
she
condescended
to
rise
we
strolled
out
under
the
trees
in
front
of
the
hotel
and
sat
down
on
the
low
stone
wall
surrounding
the
garden
the
noon
sun
hung
in
the
zenith
flooding
the
town
with
a
dazzling
downpour
sunbeams
glanced
and
danced
on
the
water
sunbeams
filtered
through
the
foliage
sunbeams
stole
under
sweetheart's
big
straw
hat
searching
the
depths
of
the
gray
eyes
sunbeams
played
merry
mischief
with
my
ears
and
neck
which
were
beginning
to
sting
in
the
first
sunburn
of
the
year
through
the
square
the
white-coiffed
women
passed
and
repassed
small
urchins
with
silver-buckled
hatbands
roamed
about
the
bridge
and
market-place
until
collected
and
trooped
off
to
school
by
a
black-robed
jesuit
frã¨re
and
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
a
dozen
sprawling
men
in
breton
costume
smoked
their
microscopical
pipes
and
watched
the
water
they
are
an
industrious
race
said
i
with
fine
irony
watching
a
happy
inebriate
pursuing
a
serpentine
course
toward
the
cafã©
opposite
sweetheart
who
was
as
patriotic
a
little
girl
as
ever
hummed
the
marseillaise
and
adopted
france
as
long
as
she
lived
in
it
was
up
in
arms
in
an
instant
i
have
read
she
said
with
conviction
that
the
bretons
are
a
brave
industrious
race
they
are
french
they
speak
a
different
language
i
said--not
a
word
of
french
in
it
they
are
french
repeated
sweetheart
with
an
inflection
which
decided
me
to
shun
the
subject
until
i
could
unpack
my
guide-book
we
sat
a
little
while
longer
under
the
trees
until
we
both
began
nodding
and
mutually
accused
each
other
then
sweetheart
went
up
to
the
room
to
take
a
nap
and
i
scorning
such
weakness
lay
down
in
a
steamer
chair
under
our
window
and
fell
fast
asleep
in
no
time
i
was
aroused
by
a
big
pink
rose
which
hit
me
squarely
on
the
mouth
sweetheart
was
perched
in
the
window
seat
above
and
as
i
looked
up
she
sent
a
shower
of
blossoms
down
upon
me
jack
you
lazy
creature
it's
five
o'clock
and
i'm
dressed
and
ready
for
a
walk
so
am
i
i
said
jumping
up
but
not
like
that
you
must
come
up
and
make
yourself
nice
for
dinner
nice
what's
the
matter
with
these
tweeds
aren't
these
new
stockings
presentable
look
at
your
hair
she
said
evasively
come
up
this
minute
and
brush
it
i
went
and
was
compelled
to
climb
into
a
white
collar
and
shirt
and
trousers
of
an
english
cut
but
before
we
had
gone
far
along
the
great
military
road
that
climbed
the
heights
above
the
little
river
i
took
sweetheart's
hand
in
mine
and
imparted
to
her
my
views
and
intentions
upon
the
subject
of
my
costume
for
the
future
you
see
dearest
we
are
here
in
brittany
for
three
reasons
the
first
is
that
i
should
paint
outdoors
the
second
is
that
we
should
economize
like
the
deuce
the
third
is
our
shadows----
i
know
she
interrupted
faintly
never
mind
jack
dear
we
walked
silently
for
a
while
hand
clasping
hand
very
tightly
for
we
were
both
thinking
of
the
third
reason
i
broke
the
silence
first
speaking
cheerfully
and
she
looked
up
with
a
quick
smile
while
the
shadow
fell
from
her
brow
you
see
dear
in
this
place
where
we
are
going
there
are
no
people
but
peasants
your
frocks
are
all
right
for
a
place
like
this
we
must
both
wear
our
free-and-easy
togs--i
for
painting
and
you
for
scrambling
about
after
your
wild
flowers
or
fishing
with
me
if
you
get
tired
of
seeing
me
in
corduroys
or
tweeds
i'll
dress
for
you
when
you
think
you
can't
stand
it
any
longer
oh
jack
i
do
like
your
knickerbockers----
and
you
shall
wear
your
most
gorgeous
gown
for
me----
indeed
i
won't
she
laughed
adding
impulsively
indeed
i
will--every
day
if
you
wish
it
at
the
top
of
the
hill
stood
an
ancient
ursuline
convent
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
which
also
inclosed
the
broad
acres
of
the
wealthy
sisterhood
we
sat
down
by
the
roadside
hedge
and
looked
across
the
valley
where
the
hurrying
river
had
ceased
to
hasten
and
now
lingered
in
placid
pools
and
long
deep
reaches
the
sun
had
set
behind
the
forest
and
the
sky
threw
a
purple
light
over
woods
and
meadow
the
grassy
pools
below
were
swept
by
flocks
of
whistling
martins
and
swallows
one
or
two
white
gulls
flapped
slowly
toward
the
tide
water
below
and
a
young
curlew
speeding
high
overhead
uttered
a
lonesome
cry
the
grass--the
brilliant
green
grass
of
brittany--had
turned
a
deep
metallic
blue
in
the
twilight
a
pale
primrose
light
grew
and
died
in
the
sky
and
the
forest
changed
from
rose
to
ashes
then
a
dull
red
bar
shot
across
the
parting
clouds
in
the
west
the
forest
smouldered
an
instant
and
the
pools
glowed
crimson
slowly
the
red
bar
melted
away
the
light
died
out
among
the
branches
the
pools
turned
sombre
looking
up
we
saw
the
new
moon
flashing
in
the
sky
above
our
heads
sweetheart
sighed
in
perfect
contentment
it's
beautiful
i
said
with
another
sigh
ah
yes
she
murmured
beautiful
to
you
and
to
me--to
me
jack
who
have
never
before
seen
this
land
of
morbihan
after
a
while
she
said
and
the
ocean--oh
how
i
long
to
see
it
is
it
near
us
jack
the
river
runs
into
it
twenty
kilometres
below
we
feel
the
tide
at
quimperlã©
i
did
not
add
baedeker
i
wonder
i
said
presently
what
are
the
feelings
of
a
little
american
who
sees
this
country--the
real
country--for
the
first
time
i
suppose
you
mean
me
she
said
i
don't
know--i
don't
think
i
understand
it
yet
but
i
know
i
shall
love
it
and
never
want
to
go
back
perhaps
we
never
shall
i
said
the
magic
second
may
stretch
into
years
that
end
at
last
as
all
ends
then
our
hands
met
in
that
sudden
nervous
clasp
which
seemed
to
help
and
steady
us
when
we
were
thinking
of
the
real
world
so
long
so
long
forgotten
ix
i
was
awakened
next
morning
by
a
spongeful
of
cold
water
in
the
face
which
i
hate
i
started
up
to
wreak
vengeance
upon
sweetheart
but
she
fled
to
the
toilet
room
and
locked
herself
in
from
this
retreat
she
taunted
me
until
further
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
and
i
bowed
to
the
inevitable--indignantly
when
i
saw
my
watch
pointed
to
five
o'clock
sweetheart
was
perfectly
possessed
to
row
so
when
i
had
bolted
my
coffee
and
sat
watching
her
placidly
sip
hers
we
decided
to
go
down
to
the
bank
of
the
little
stream
and
hire
a
boat
the
boat
was
a
wretched
shapeless
affair
with
two
enormous
oars
and
the
remnants
of
rowlocks
it
was
the
best
boat
in
town
so
we
took
it
i
managed
to
get
away
from
the
bank
and
conscious
of
sweetheart's
open
admiration
pulled
boldly
down
the
stream
it
was
easy
work
for
the
tide
was
ebbing
the
river
up
to
the
bridge
was
tidal
but
above
the
bridge
it
leaped
and
flowed
a
regular
salmon
stream
sweetheart
was
so
impatient
to
take
the
oars
that
i
relinquished
them
and
picked
up
my
rod
the
boat
swung
down
the
stream
and
under
the
high
stone
viaduct
where
i
insisted
on
anchoring
and
whipping
the
promising-looking
water
the
water
was
likely
enough
and
the
sudden
splash
of
a
leaping
grilse
added
to
its
likelihood
i
was
in
hopes
a
grilse
might
become
entangled
with
one
of
the
flies
but
though
a
big
one
shot
up
out
of
the
water
within
five
feet
of
sweetheart
causing
her
to
utter
a
suppressed
scream
neither
grilse
nor
trout
rose
to
the
beautiful
lures
i
trailed
about
and
i
only
hooked
two
or
three
enormous
dace
which
came
up
like
logs
and
covered
the
bottom
of
the
boat
with
their
coarse
scales
sweetheart
had
never
seen
a
french
trout
uncooked
and
scarcely
shared
my
disappointment
they
are
splendid
fish
she
repeated
you
are
unreasonable
there
was
an
ancient
breton
squatting
on
the
bank
from
his
sulky
attitude
i
took
him
to
be
a
poacher
visiting
his
infernal
set
lines
and
snares
but
i
hailed
him
pleasantly
with
a
bonjour
which
he
returned
civilly
enough
are
there
trout
in
this
stream
about
the
bridge
he
replied
cautiously
have
you
caught
any
i
ain't
fishing
he
said
much
alarmed
what's
that
i
demanded
pointing
to
as
plump
a
trout
as
ever
i
saw
floating
on
the
end
of
a
string
under
the
bank
where
he
asked
looking
about
him
with
affected
concern
there
he
looked
around
everywhere
except
where
i
pointed
he
examined
the
horizon
and
the
tree
tops
as
though
he
expected
a
fish
on
every
twig
i
poled
the
boat
up
to
the
bank
and
pointed
out
the
fish
ma
doui
he
exclaimed
there
is
a
fish
yes
a
trout
i
said
trout
he
burst
into
a
forced
laugh
trout
ha
ha
why
monsieur
that
is
a
dace--a
poor
little
dace
he
hastily
jerked
it
up
with
a
long
homemade
gaff
which
lay--of
course
quite
by
accident--at
his
feet
a
poor
little
dace
he
mumbled
of
course
monsieur
would
not
care
to
claim
such
a
poor
coarse
little
fish
but
i
am
only
too
glad
to
eat
it--ah
yes
only
too
glad
you
see
said
sweetheart
impulsively
that
you
are
wrong
give
him
our
fish
that
will
make
four
dace
for
the
poor
fellow
i
placed
the
three
dace
across
the
blade
of
my
oar
and
held
it
out
to
the
poacher
he
took
them
as
if
he
were
really
glad
to
get
them
then
i
said
these
are
dace
and
they
don't
have
red
spots
he
stood
as
if
ready
to
bolt
but
i
laughed
and
settled
back
on
my
oars
saying
you're
a
poacher
but
i
don't
care
a
continental
and
you
can
poach
all
day
in
this
confounded
country
where
there
is
about
one
trout
to
the
kilometre
don't
look
scared
what
do
i
care
only
don't
tell
me
i'm
unable
to
distinguish
a
trout
when
i
can
see
the
tip
of
his
nose
i
then
sailed
majestically
out
into
the
stream
sweetheart
wanted
to
know
whether
that
was
really
a
real
poacher
she
had
read
about
them
her
ideal
poacher
was
a
young
stalwart
eagle-eyed
giant
with
a
tangle
of
hair
and
a
disposition
toward
assassination
the
reality
shocked
her
anyway
she
said
you
frightened
the
poor
old
thing
how
rough
men
are
we
returned
to
the
landing
place
with
difficulty
for
the
tide
was
still
on
the
ebb
and
we
got
aground
more
than
once
my
hands
were
in
a
fine
condition
when
at
last
i
drove
that
wretched
scow
into
the
mud
and
lifted
sweetheart
out
to
the
firm
bank
the
evil-eyed
old
man
who
rented
us
the
boat
glanced
sardonically
at
my
rod
and
blistered
hands
and
i
was
glad
enough
to
pay
him
all
he
asked
and
break
away
for
the
hotel
we
had
an
hour
to
lunch
in
pack
and
be
ready
for
the
trap
which
was
to
bear
us
to
our
destination--the
distant
village
of
faã¶uet
in
morbihan
x
a
long
drive
on
a
smooth
white
road
acres
of
gorse
and
broom
beech
woods
and
oak
thickets
and
the
heu
heu
allo
allons
en
route
of
the
breton
driver
these
are
my
recollections
of
the
ride
to
faã¶uet
there
are
others
too--the
hedges
heavy
with
bloom
the
perfume
of
the
wild
honeysuckle
the
continual
bird
chorus
from
every
grove
and
every
bramble
patch--and
sweetheart's
veil
flying
into
my
face
we
have
spoken
of
it
since
together
but
she
has
few
recollections
of
that
journey
she
only
remembers
it
as
her
first
steps
into
our
heritage
and
so
we
entered
into
our
heritage
sweetheart
and
i
and
our
heritage
was
very
fair
for
it
lay
everywhere
about
us
it
was
a
world
which
we
alone
inhabited
men
said
this
land
is
gloanec's
this
is
gurnalec's
this
is
kerdec's
they
spoke
of
my
woods
and
his
meadows
and
their
pastures
and
how
we
laughed
for
when
we
passed
together
through
their
lands
around
us
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
our
heritage
lay
in
the
sunshine
xi
one
day
when
sweetheart
had
been
weeping--for
we
were
thinking
of
the
end
to
the
magic
second--i
spoke
of
our
heritage
which
swept
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
across
the
moors
of
faã¶uet
she
said
the
past
is
ours
jack
the
present
is
ours
the
future----
we
tried
to
smile
but
our
hearts
were
like
lead
yet
we
know
that
the
future
will
also
be
ours
i
know
it
as
i
write
xii
the
letter
from
st
gildas
bringing
with
it
a
breath
of
salt
air
lay
on
the
table
before
us
sweetheart
clasped
her
hands
and
looked
at
me
i'm
in
favour
of
going
at
once
i
said
for
the
third
time
over
by
the
wall
were
piled
my
canvases
the
result
of
three
months
in
faã¶uet
the
first
was
a
study
of
sweetheart
under
the
trees
of
the
ancient
orchard
in
the
convent
grounds
what
trouble
i
had
had
with
that
canvas
i
remembered
the
morning
that
the
old
gardener
came
over
and
stood
behind
me
as
i
painted
and
when
i
had
replied
to
his
good-morning
i
recalled
the
pang
his
next
words
gave
me
i
am
so
sorry
monsieur
but
it
is
forbidden
to
enter
the
convent
grounds
my
canvas
was
almost
finished
and
as
the
romancers
have
it
my
despair
was
great
a
month's
work
for
nothing--or
next
to
nothing
sweetheart
rose
from
her
pose
on
the
low
bough
of
the
apple
tree
and
came
over
to
my
side
never
mind
jack
i
shall
go
and
ask
the
mother
superior
about
it
i
knew
that
she
would
win
over
the
mother
superior
and
when
that
evening
she
came
back
radiant
crying
she
is
lovely--she
says
you
may
finish
the
picture
and
i
think
you
ought
to
go
and
thank
her
i
put
on
my
cap
and
stepping
across
the
street
we
rang
at
the
gate
the
old
gardener
let
us
in
and
in
a
moment
i
stood
before
the
latticed
windows
behind
which
some
one
was
moving
in
a
low
voice
the
invisible
nun
told
us
that
the
superior
granted
to
us
the
privilege
of
working
in
the
orchard
but
we
must
be
careful
of
the
grass
because
it
was
almost
time
to
cut
it
i
am
sure
we
may
have
confidence
in
you
she
said
we
will
not
trample
the
grass
my
sister
and
i
thank
you
for
us
both
the
lattice
trembled
was
raised
a
little
and
then
fell
you
are
english
said
the
hidden
nun
i
am
american
my
sister
i
looked
at
the
lattice
a
moment
then
dropped
my
eyes
i
may
have
been
mistaken
but
i
think
she
sighed
sweetheart
came
closer
to
the
lattice
and
murmured
her
thanks
there
was
a
pause
then
came
the
voice
again
sweet
and
gentle
may
our
lady
of
saint
gildas
protect
you
and
we
went
out
by
the
little
iron
wicket
the
next
picture
was
another
study
of
sweetheart
in
the
woods
the
next
another
study
of
sweetheart
and
the
others
were
studies
of
the
same
young
lady
the
light
in
the
room
had
grown
dim
and
i
walked
to
the
window
which
overlooked
the
convent
chapel
the
chapel
windows
were
open
within
the
nuns
stood
or
knelt
chanting
three
white-veiled
figures
were
advancing
to
the
altar
and
the
others
draped
in
black
now
knelt
behind
i
didn't
think
i
had
any
business
to
look
at
them
so
i
did
not
after
all
they
were
cloistered
nuns
and
it
was
only
on
hot
nights
that
they
opened
the
chapel
windows
sweetheart
was
speaking
beside
my
shoulder
poor
things
the
ones
in
white
they
are
the
novices
they
will
never
see
parents
or
friends
again
when
they
enter
the
gates
they
never
leave--never
they
are
buried
there
i
said
after
all
we
are
much
like
them
we
have
left
all
we
have
nothing
now
but
each
other
for
the
world
is
dead
and
we
are
bound
by
vows
which
keep
us
within
the
narrow
confines
of
our
heritage
but
our
heritage
is
everywhere--as
far
as
we
can
see
ah
yes
but
we
can
only
see
to
the
horizon
there
is
a
world
beyond
i
have
renounced
it
said
sweetheart
faintly
xiii
the
letter
from
st
gildas
had
been
lying
on
our
table
for
a
week
before
i
thought
of
answering
it
and
even
then
it
was
sweetheart
who
wrote
dear
mr
stuart
jack
is
too
lazy
to
answer
your
kind
note
so
in
pure
shame
for
his
discourtesy
i
hasten
to
reply
to
your
questions
first
yes
we
have
been
working
very
hard
and
jack's
pictures
are
charming
though
he
growls
over
them
all
day
second
yes
we
intend
to
stay
in
brittany
this
winter
for
lots
of
reasons--one
being
economy
and
another
jack's
outdoor
painting
third
yes
we
are
coming
to
st
gildas
fourth
to-morrow
fifth
no
we
had
not
heard
of
mr
clifford's
affair
with
the
policeman
and
oh
i
am
so
sorry
he
was
locked
up
and
fined
jack
laughs
i
suspect
he
too
was
as
wicked
as
you
all
when
he
was
a
student
alone
in
paris
sixth
i
know
you
are
jack's
oldest
and
most
intimate
friend
so
i
allow
you
more
liberty
than
i
do
messieurs
clifford
and
elliott
therefore
i
will
answer
your
question
as
to
whether
the
honeymoon
is
not
on
the
wane
no
no
no
there
are
three
answers
to
one
question
see
how
generous
i
can
be
sweetheart
called
me
to
see
whether
or
not
i
approved
i
did
and
added
my
answer
to
stuart's
last
question
as
follows
no
you
idiot
then
i
signed
the
note
and
sweetheart
sealed
and
directed
it
so
we
left
for
st
gildas
next
morning
before
sunrise
and
in
the
rain
this
leaving
at
such
an
unearthly
hour
was
not
my
doing
but
sweetheart
was
determined
and
rose
by
candlelight
in
spite
of
desperate
opposition
on
my
part
it
was
cold
and
the
rain
beat
against
the
windows
it
was
many
kilometres
to
st
gildas
but
before
we
had
gone
six
the
rain
had
ceased
and
the
eastern
sky
flushed
to
a
pale
rose
thank
goodness
i
said
we
shall
have
the
sun
then
the
daily
repeated
miracle
of
the
coming
of
dawn
was
wrought
before
our
eyes
the
heavens
glowed
in
rainbow
tints
the
shredded
mist
rising
along
the
river
was
touched
with
purple
and
gold
and
acres
of
meadow
and
pasture
dripped
precious
stones
shreds
of
the
fading
night-mist
drifted
among
the
tree
tops
now
tipped
with
fire
while
in
the
forest
depths
faint
sparkles
came
from
some
lost
ray
of
morning
light
falling
on
wet
leaves
then
of
a
sudden
up
shot
the
sun
and
against
it
black
and
gigantic
a
peasant
towered
leaning
upon
his
spade
xiv
we
were
fast
nearing
the
end
of
our
long
journey
the
sun
blazed
on
us
from
the
zenith
and
the
wheels
creaked
with
the
heat
of
the
white
road
the
driver
leaned
back
saying
we
enter
finistã¨re
here
by
this
granite
post
presently
he
added
the
ocean
there
it
lay
a
basin
of
silver
and
blue
sweetheart
had
started
to
her
feet
speechless
one
hand
holding
to
my
shoulder
the
other
clasped
to
her
breast
and
now
as
the
road
wound
through
the
hills
and
down
to
the
coast
long
stretches
of
white
sand
skirted
the
distant
cliffs
and
over
the
cliffs
waved
miles
and
miles
of
yellow
gorse
a
cluster
of
white
and
gray
houses
lay
in
the
hollow
to
the
left
almost
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
beyond
the
waves
were
beating
in
the
bar--beating
the
same
rhythm
which
we
were
to
hear
so
long
there
together
day
and
night
there
was
not
a
boat
to
be
seen
not
a
creature
nor
was
there
any
sign
of
life
save
for
the
smoke
curling
from
a
cottage
chimney
below
the
ocean
lay
sparkling
beneath
and
beyond
its
deeper
blue
melted
into
the
haze
on
the
horizon
suddenly
in
the
road
below
the
figure
of
a
man
appeared
and
at
the
same
moment
a
pointer
pup
came
gambolling
up
beside
us
in
an
ecstasy
of
self-abnegation
and
apology
i
sprang
out
of
the
lumbering
vehicle
and
lifted
sweetheart
to
the
ground
and
in
an
instant
we
were
shaking
hands
with
a
stalwart
young
fellow
in
knickerbockers
and
jersey
who
said
we
were
a
pretty
pair
not
to
have
come
sooner
and
told
sweetheart
he
pitied
her
lot--meaning
me
then
we
walked
arm
in
arm
down
a
fragrant
lane
to
the
river
bank
where
the
dearest
old
lady
toddled
out
of
the
granite
house
to
welcome
us
and
show
us
our
rooms
sweetheart
went
with
her
while
i
stopped
an
instant
to
chat
with
stuart
that
is
madame
ylven
he
said
she
is
the
most
stunning
peasant
woman
in
finistã¨re
and
you
will
want
for
nothing
then
after
a
moment
good
heavens
jack
what
a
beauty
your
wife----
he
stopped
short
but
added
what
a
delicious
little
beauty
sweetheart
has
grown
to
be
a
white-coiffed
maid
came
to
the
door
and
said
will
monsieur
have
the
goodness
to
come
madame
wishes
him
to
see
the
rooms
the
wind
blew
from
the
south
and
the
thunder
of
the
sea
was
in
my
ears
as
i
mounted
the
stairs
to
our
new
quarters
sweetheart
met
me
at
the
door
saying
it
seems
almost
too
much
happiness
to
bear
but
i
feel
that
we
are
at
home
at
last--alone
together
for
all
time
alone
together
the
ocean
at
our
threshold
the
moors
and
forests
at
our
back
and
a
good
slate
roof
above
us
before
me
through
the
open
door
i
could
see
the
great
old-fashioned
room
warm
in
the
afternoon
sunlight--the
room
we
were
to
live
in
so
long
the
room
in
which
we
were
to
pass
the
happiest
and
bitterest
moments
of
our
lives
she
hesitated
an
instant
before
the
threshold
i
think
we
knew
that
we
stood
upon
the
threshold
of
our
destiny
then
i
said
half
in
earnest
are
you
afraid
to
cross
with
me
into
the
unknown
future
see
the
room
is
filled
with
sunshine
are
you
afraid
she
sprang
across
the
threshold
and
turning
to
me
held
out
both
hands
xv
the
sun
slipped
lower
and
lower
into
the
sea
until
a
distant
tossing
wave
washed
it
out
against
the
sky
light
died
in
the
room
and
shadows
closed
around
us
yet
it
was
in
the
darkness
and
shadows
that
we
drew
nearer
to
each
other
then
and
after
xvi
stuart
stood
under
our
window
and
yelled
up
at
me
oh
jack
i
say
jack
sweetheart
who
was
fussing
over
the
half-unpacked
trunk
went
to
the
window
and
threw
open
the
panes
you
don't
mean
to
say
you
have
had
your
coffee
she
said
jack
isn't
up
yet
jack
is
up
i
explained
coming
to
the
window
in
pajamas
hello
i
only
wanted
to
say
that
i
haven't
had
my
coffee
he
explained
and
i'm
going
to
take
it
with
you
when
you're
ready
sweetheart
picked
up
her
bã©ret
and
passing
a
hatpin
through
it
turned
to
me
with
a
warning
i
shall
eat
all
the
breakfast
monsieur
and
vanished
down
the
stairs
a
moment
later
i
heard
her
clear
voice
below
sonnez
le
chå“ur
chasseur
sonnez
la
mort
before
i
had
finished
dressing
sweetheart
tripped
in
with
my
coffee
and
toast
of
course
i've
finished
she
said
and
you
don't
deserve
this
mr
stuart
has
gone
off
with
his
canvases
and
says
he'll
see
you
at
lunch
i
swallowed
the
coffee
and
browsed
on
little
squares
of
toast
which
she
condescendingly
buttered
for
me
and
then
lighting
a
cigarette
i
announced
my
intention
of
commanding
an
exploring
expedition
consisting
of
sweetheart
and
myself
a
scratching
at
the
door
and
a
patter
of
feet
announced
that
i
had
been
overheard
sweetheart
unlatched
the
door
and
the
pointer
pup
of
the
evening
before
charged
into
the
room
and
covered
us
with
boisterous
caresses
which
we
took
to
indicate
that
he
not
only
approved
of
the
expedition
but
intended
to
undertake
the
general
supervision
of
it
himself
i
resigned
the
leadership
at
once
his
name
said
sweetheart
in
the
tone
of
one
who
presents
a
distinguished
guest
is
'luff'
i
gravely
acknowledged
the
honour
by
patting
his
head
i'm
afraid
i
said
to
sweetheart
that
there
is
a
bar
sinister
upon
his
escutcheon
but
possibly
it
is
only
the
indelible
mark
of
the
conquering
british
foxhound
sweetheart
said
nonsense
and
the
expedition
moved
luff
leading
with
a
series
of
ear-splitting
orders
in
the
dog
language
which
we
perfectly
understood
in
ten
minutes
we
stood
on
the
cliffs
the
salt
wind
whipping
our
faces
saint-gildas-des-prã©s
lay
at
our
feet
i
know
observed
sweetheart
calmly
all
about
this
place
captain
ylven
told
me
at
breakfast
well
said
i
what's
that
island
on
the
horizon
then
she
overwhelmed
me
with
erudition
until
i
longed
for
baedeker
and
revenge
that
is
the
isle
de
groix
and
all
about
us
is
the
bay
of
biscay
this
little
hamlet
on
the
cliff
is
st
julien
and
if
we
follow
the
coast
far
enough
we
come
to
lorient
follow
the
coast
which
way
sweetheart
had
forgotten
and
i
triumphed
in
silence
until
she
stamped
her
foot
and
marched
off
to
assist
luff
in
investigating
a
suspicious
hole
in
the
cliff
i
went
to
the
edge
of
the
plateau
and
looked
over
the
surf
thundered
against
the
rocks
tossing
long
strands
of
seaweed
over
the
pebbly
beach
a
man
with
a
wooden
rake
stood
in
the
water
up
to
his
knees
he
raked
the
seaweed
from
the
breakers
as
a
farmer
rakes
weeds
from
the
lawn
the
salt
wind
began
to
sting
my
lips
and
eyes
my
throat
felt
dry
and
salty
i
turned
toward
the
hamlet
of
st
gildas
i
had
not
imagined
it
so
small
besides
our
house
there
were
but
three
others
clustered
under
the
river
bank
behind
it
stretched
woods
and
grain
fields
broken
by
patches
of
yellow
gorse
across
the
river
stood
a
stone
chapel
almost
lost
in
the
miles
of
moorland
to
the
east
and
west
the
downs
covered
with
gorse
and
heather
rolled
to
the
horizon
here
and
there
along
the
cliffs
stood
what
appeared
to
be
the
ruins
of
ancient
forts
and
on
a
rock
just
where
the
river
sweeps
out
into
the
sea
rose
a
dirty
white
signal
tower
the
tower
was
low
and
squatty
and
wet
it
looked
like
some
saline
excrescence
which
had
slowly
exuded
from
the
brine-soaked
rock
on
the
bar
hundreds
of
white
gulls
rose
and
settled
as
the
tide
encroached
curlew
were
running
along
the
foam-splashed
shore
under
the
eastern
cliffs
across
the
river
on
our
side
of
the
river
the
cliffs
were
covered
with
blackthorn
and
hawthorn
with
here
and
there
a
stunted
oak
probably
so
placed
by
providence
as
general
rendezvous
for
all
the
small
twittering
birds
of
finistã¨re
birds
were
everywhere
from
the
clouds
came
the
ceaseless
carol
of
skylarks
from
the
grain
fields
and
the
flowering
gorse
rose
an
unbroken
chorus
taken
up
and
repeated
by
flocks
of
microscopical
songsters
among
the
blackthorns
on
the
cliffs
this
is
paradise
this
wilderness
i
thought
then
as
i
heard
sweetheart's
mocking
voice
from
the
cliff
o
frã¨re
jacques
dormez
vous
i'm
not
asleep
i
cried
in
answer
what
is
it
luff
has
unearthed
a
poor
little
mole
but
i
won't
allow
him
to
hurt
it
jack
dear
she
said
as
i
came
up
couldn't
we
keep
it
as
a
pet
see
the
poor
little
thing
is
blind
as
it
was
blind
we
called
it
love
which
later
was
changed
to
cupid
and
finally
when
we
discovered
it
true
gormandizing
character
for
cupid
we
substituted
cupidity
by
which
name
it
flourished
and
fattened
what
a
change
said
sweetheart
sadly
from
blind
love
to
blind
greed
the
mole
grew
very
fat
xvii
when
the
winds
stir
the
leaves
among
the
poplars
and
the
long
shadows
fall
athwart
the
fields
when
the
winds
rise
at
night
and
the
branches
scrape
and
crack
above
the
moonlit
snow
when
in
the
long
hot
days
the
earth
is
bathed
in
fragrance
and
all
the
little
creatures
of
the
fields
are
silent
when
in
the
still
evenings
the
flowers
perfume
the
air
and
the
gravel
walks
shine
white
in
the
moonlight
when
the
breezes
quicken
from
the
distant
coast
when
the
sand
shakes
beneath
the
shock
of
the
breakers
and
every
wave
is
plumed
with
white
when
the
calm
eye
of
the
beacon
turns
to
mine
lingers
and
turn
away
and
the
surf
is
yeasty
and
thick
when
i
start
at
the
sound
of
a
voice
from
the
cliffs
and
my
eyes
are
raised
in
vain
when
the
white
gulls
toss
and
drift
in
the
storm-clouds
and
the
water
hurries
out
in
the
black
ebb
tide
when
i
rise
and
look
from
the
window
when
i
dress
when
i
work
with
pen
and
colour
when
i
rest
when
i
walk
when
i
sleep--there
is
one
face
before
my
eyes
one
name
on
my
lips
for
the
white
shadow
is
turning
gray
and
god
alone
knows
the
end
xviii
and
god
alone
knows
the
end
for
the
mists
are
crowding
brooding
like
angry-browed
clouds
and
i
hear
the
whistle
of
unseen
winds
and
my
life-flame
wavers
and
sinks
and
flares
blown
hither
and
thither
tossing
fading
leaping
but
fading
always
fading
in
a
flash
like
a
printed
picture
on
a
screen
illuminated
keenly
etched
in
the
white
glare
i
see
the
bed
and
the
people
around
me
the
black
gowns
the
pale
eyes
of
the
doctor
the
sponge
and
basin
the
rolls
of
lint
voices
minute
but
clean-cut
and
clear
as
picked
harp-strings
tinkle
in
my
ears
the
voice
of
the
doctor
other
voices
but
always
the
voice
of
the
doctor--the
splinter
of
bone
on
the
brain
the
splinter
pressing
on
the
tissues
the
depression
the
doctor
that
is
the
man
that
is
the
man
who
comes
to
my
side
who
follows
follows
where
i
go
who
seeks
me
throughout
the
world
i
saw
him
as
i
lay
flung
on
the
turf
limp
unconscious
below
the
cliffs
on
the
aspen
hills
i
felt
his
presence
in
the
studio
i
heard
him
creeping
at
my
heels
across
the
gorse
thickets
of
st
gildas
and
now
he
has
come
to
cut
short
the
magic
second
to
turn
back
time--back
back
into
the
old
worn
channels
rock-ribbed
and
salt
with
tears
as
a
leaf
of
written
paper
torn
in
two
so
shall
my
life
be
torn
in
two
and
the
long
tear
shall
mangle
the
chapter
written
in
rose
and
gold
then
too
my
shadow
already
turned
from
white
to
gray
shall
fall
with
a
deeper
stain
wherever
i
pass
and
i
shall
see
the
yellow
gorse
glimmer
and
turn
to
golden-rod
and
the
poplars
turn
to
oaks
and
the
twin
towers
of
notre
dame
filmy
lace-carved
and
gray
with
centuries
shall
dwindle
as
i
look--dwindle
and
sway
and
turn
to
pines
singing
pines
that
murmur
to
the
winds
blowing
across
the
aspen
hills





all
that
is
fair
shall
pass
away
all
that
i
love
all
that
i
fear
for--these
shall
the
doctor
take
away
lifting
them
from
my
memory
on
the
point
of
a
steel
blade
what
has
he
to
give
in
return
a
hell
of
vapour
distorting
sight
a
hell
of
sound
drowning
the
soul





gigantic
apparitions
arise
across
the
world
of
water
wavering
like
shadows
on
the
clouds
steel-clad
clothed
in
skins
casqued
in
steel
their
winged
heads
bend
and
nod
and
move
against
the
clouds
and
even
they
are
changing
as
clouds
change
shape
i
see
steel
limbs
turn
red
and
naked
i
see
winged
casques
trail
to
the

the

of

the

my
shadow
is
turning
dark
i
can
scarcely
see
the
doctor
but
now--god
have
mercy--i
can
touch
him





all
the
high
spectres
are
stooping
from
the

now
they
leave
my
bed
the
people
who
crowded
there
under
the
shadowy
forms
of
the
spectres
now
the
doctor
bends
over
i
see
and
feel
him
his
hands
are
tangled
in
the
threads
of
time
he
is
cutting
a
thread
he----
xix
when
i
spoke
to
him
first
i
spoke
in
the
french
language
before
he
answered
the
scream
of
a
blue
jay
in
the
elms
outside
set
my
nerves
aquiver
and
i
called
for
donald
and
walter
as
i
lay
there
i
could
see
the
aspen
hills
from
the
window
heaps
of
crumpled
gold
bathed
in
sunshine
over
them
sailed
the
froth
from
the
silken
milkweed
over
them
drifted
the
big
brown-red
butterflies
luminous
as
richest
autumn
leaves
some
one
closed
the
door
softly
the
doctor
had
gone
the
sunlight
poured
into
the
window
etching
my
shadow
on
the
wall
behind
lying
very
still
there
i
saw
it
motionless
beside
me
the
shadow
was
black
somebody
said
in
the
next
room
will
he
die
die
i
said
aloud
a
bird
twittered
outside
my
window
the
door
opened
again
noiselessly
sweetheart
i
whispered
yes
jack
after
a
moment
i
said
when
do
you
go
back
to
school
i
i
finished
school
a
year
ago
come
nearer
i
am
here
jack
time
stopped
a
year
ago
a
year
ago
to-day
the
same
gray
eyes
the
same
face
paler
perhaps
we
have
journeyed
far
i
sighed
always
together
but
in
those
days
our
shadows
were
white
as
snow
am
i
going
to
die
there
are
tears
in
your
eyes
they
fell
on
my
cheek
her
arms
fell
too
closer
closer
around
my
neck
life
has
begun
she
said
life
what
was
the
year
that
ends
to-day
the
magic
second
of
life
a
year
of
death
to
me
ah
but
her
soul
knows
of
a
life
in
death
and
she
shall
know
it
too
when
her
shadow
turns
whiter
than
snow
for
the
temple
of
idols
has
closed
its
doors
at
the
sound
of
a
voice
and
an
idol
of
gilt
has
turned
to
flesh
and
blood
i-hã³
so
shall
she
know
of
the
life
in
death
when
her
soul
and
her
body
are
one
passeur
o
friends
i've
served
ye
food
and
bed
o
friends
the
mist
is
rising
wet
then
bide
a
moment
o
my
dead
where
lonely
i
must
linger
yet
passeur
because
man
goeth
to
his
long
home
and
the
mourners
go
about
the
streets
when
he
had
finished
his
pipe
he
tapped
the
brier
bowl
against
the
chimney
until
the
ashes
powdered
the
charred
log
smouldering
across
the
andirons
then
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
absently
touching
the
hot
pipe-bowl
with
the
tip
of
each
finger
until
it
grew
cool
enough
to
be
dropped
into
his
coat
pocket
twice
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
little
american
clock
ticking
upon
the
mantel
he
had
half
an
hour
to
wait
the
three
candles
that
lighted
the
room
might
be
trimmed
to
advantage
this
would
give
him
something
to
do
a
pair
of
scissors
lay
open
upon
the
bureau
and
he
rose
and
picked
them
up
for
a
while
he
stood
dreamily
shutting
and
opening
the
scissors
his
eyes
roaming
about
the
room
there
was
an
easel
in
the
corner
and
a
pile
of
dusty
canvases
behind
it
behind
the
canvases
there
was
a
shadow--that
gray
menacing
shadow
that
never
moved
when
he
had
trimmed
each
candle
he
wiped
the
smoky
scissors
on
a
paint
rag
and
flung
them
on
the
bureau
again
the
clock
pointed
to
ten
he
had
been
occupied
exactly
three
minutes
the
bureau
was
littered
with
neckties
pipes
combs
and
brushes
matches
reels
and
fly-books
collars
shirt
studs
a
new
pair
of
scotch
shooting
stockings
and
a
woman's
workbasket
he
picked
out
all
the
neckties
folded
them
once
and
hung
them
over
a
bit
of
twine
that
stretched
across
the
looking-glass
the
shirt
studs
he
shovelled
into
the
top
drawer
along
with
brushes
combs
and
stockings
the
reels
and
fly-books
he
dusted
with
his
handkerchief
and
placed
methodically
along
the
mantel
shelf
twice
he
stretched
out
his
hand
toward
the
woman's
workbasket
but
his
hand
fell
to
his
side
again
and
he
turned
away
into
the
room
staring
at
the
dying
fire
outside
the
snow-sealed
window
a
shutter
broke
loose
and
banged
monotonously
until
he
flung
open
the
panes
and
fastened
it
the
soft
wet
snow
that
had
choked
the
window-panes
all
day
was
frozen
hard
now
and
he
had
to
break
the
polished
crust
before
he
could
find
the
rusty
shutter
hinge
he
leaned
out
for
a
moment
his
numbed
hands
resting
on
the
snow
the
roar
of
a
rising
snow-squall
in
his
ears
and
out
across
the
desolate
garden
and
stark
hedgerow
he
saw
the
flat
black
river
spreading
through
the
gloom
a
candle
sputtered
and
snapped
behind
him
a
sheet
of
drawing-paper
fluttered
across
the
floor
and
he
closed
the
panes
and
turned
back
into
the
room
both
hands
in
his
worn
pockets
the
little
american
clock
on
the
mantel
ticked
and
ticked
but
the
hands
lagged
for
he
had
not
been
occupied
five
minutes
in
all
he
went
up
to
the
mantel
and
watched
the
hands
of
the
clock
a
minute--longer
than
a
year
to
him--crept
by
around
the
room
the
furniture
stood
ranged--a
chair
or
two
of
yellow
pine
a
table
the
easel
and
in
one
corner
the
broad
curtained
bed
and
behind
each
lay
shadows
menacing
shadows
that
never
moved
a
little
pale
flame
started
up
from
the
smoking
log
on
the
andirons
the
room
sang
with
the
sudden
hiss
of
escaping
wood
gases
after
a
little
the
back
of
the
log
caught
fire
jets
of
blue
flared
up
here
and
there
with
mellow
sounds
like
the
lighting
of
gas-burners
in
a
row
and
in
a
moment
a
thin
sheet
of
yellow
flame
wrapped
the
whole
charred
log
then
the
shadows
moved
not
the
shadows
behind
the
furniture--they
never
moved--but
other
shadows
thin
gray
confusing
that
came
and
spread
their
slim
patterns
all
around
him
and
trembled
and
trembled
he
dared
not
step
or
tread
upon
them
they
were
too
real
they
meshed
the
floor
around
his
feet
they
ensnared
his
knees
they
fell
across
his
breast
like
ropes
some
night
in
the
silence
of
the
moors
when
wind
and
river
were
still
he
feared
these
strands
of
shadow
might
tighten--creep
higher
around
his
throat
and
tighten
but
even
then
he
knew
that
those
other
shadows
would
never
move
those
gray
shapes
that
knelt
crouching
in
every
corner
when
he
looked
up
at
the
clock
again
ten
minutes
had
straggled
past
time
was
disturbed
in
the
room
the
strands
of
shadow
seemed
entangled
among
the
hands
of
the
clock
dragging
them
back
from
their
rotation
he
wondered
if
the
shadows
would
strangle
time
some
still
night
when
the
wind
and
the
flat
river
were
silent
there
grew
a
sudden
chill
across
the
floor
the
cracks
of
the
boards
let
it
in
he
leaned
down
and
drew
his
sabots
toward
him
from
their
place
near
the
andirons
and
slipped
them
over
his
chaussons
and
as
he
straightened
up
his
eyes
mechanically
sought
the
mantel
above
where
in
the
dusk
another
pair
of
sabots
stood
little
slender
delicate
sabots
carved
from
red
beech
a
year's
dust
grayed
their
surface
a
year's
rust
dulled
the
silver
band
across
the
instep
he
said
this
to
himself
aloud
knowing
that
it
was
within
a
few
minutes
of
the
year
his
own
sabots
came
from
mort-dieu
they
were
shaved
square
and
banded
with
steel
but
in
days
past
he
had
thought
that
no
sabot
in
mort-dieu
was
delicate
enough
to
touch
the
instep
of
the
mort-dieu
passeur
so
he
sent
to
the
shore
lighthouse
and
they
sent
to
lorient
where
the
women
are
coquettish
and
show
their
hair
under
the
coiffe
and
wear
dainty
sabots
and
in
this
town
where
vanity
corrupts
and
there
is
much
lace
on
coiffe
and
collarette
a
pair
of
delicate
sabots
was
found
banded
with
silver
and
chiselled
in
red
beech
the
sabots
stood
on
the
mantel
above
the
fire
now
dusty
and
tarnished
there
was
a
sound
from
the
window
the
soft
murmur
of
snow
blotting
glass
panes
the
wind
too
muttered
under
the
roof
eaves
presently
it
would
begin
to
whisper
to
him
from
the
chimney--he
knew
it--and
he
held
his
hands
over
his
ears
and
stared
at
the
clock
in
the
hamlet
of
mort-dieu
the
pines
sing
all
day
of
the
sea
secrets
but
in
the
night
the
ghosts
of
little
gray
birds
fill
the
branches
singing
of
the
sunshine
of
past
years
he
heard
the
song
as
he
sat
and
he
crushed
his
hands
over
his
ears
but
the
gray
birds
joined
with
the
wind
in
the
chimney
and
he
heard
all
that
he
dared
not
hear
and
he
thought
all
that
he
dared
not
hope
or
think
and
the
swift
tears
scalded
his
eyes
in
mort-dieu
the
nights
are
longer
than
anywhere
on
earth
he
knew
it--why
should
he
not
know
this
had
been
so
for
a
year
it
was
different
before
there
were
so
many
things
different
before
days
and
nights
vanished
like
minutes
then
the
pines
told
no
secrets
of
the
sea
and
the
gray
birds
had
not
yet
come
to
mort-dieu
also
there
was
jeanne
passeur
at
the
carmes
when
he
first
saw
her
she
was
poling
the
square
flat-bottomed
ferry
skiff
from
the
carmes
to
mort-dieu
a
red
handkerchief
bound
across
her
silky
black
hair
a
red
skirt
fluttering
just
below
her
knees
the
next
time
he
saw
her
he
had
to
call
to
her
across
the
placid
river
ohã©
ohã©
passeur
she
came
poling
the
flat
skiff
her
deep
blue
eyes
fixed
pensively
on
him
the
scarlet
skirt
and
kerchief
idly
flapping
in
the
april
wind
then
day
followed
day
when
the
far
call
passeur
grew
clearer
and
more
joyous
and
the
faint
answering
cry
i
come
rippled
across
the
water
like
music
tinged
with
laughter
then
spring
came
and
with
spring
came
love--love
carried
free
across
the
ferry
from
the
carmes
to
mort-dieu
the
flame
above
the
charred
log
whistled
flickered
and
went
out
in
a
jet
of
wood
vapour
only
to
play
like
lightning
above
the
gas
and
relight
again
the
clock
ticked
more
loudly
and
the
song
from
the
pines
filled
the
room
but
in
his
straining
eyes
a
summer
landscape
was
reflected
where
white
clouds
sailed
and
white
foam
curled
under
the
square
bow
of
a
little
skiff
and
he
pressed
his
numbed
hands
tighter
to
his
ears
to
drown
the
cry
passeur
passeur
and
now
for
a
moment
the
clock
ceased
ticking
it
was
time
to
go--who
but
he
should
know
it
he
who
went
out
into
the
night
swinging
his
lantern
and
he
went
he
had
gone
each
night
from
the
first--from
that
first
strange
winter
evening
when
a
strange
voice
had
answered
him
across
the
river
the
voice
of
the
new
passeur
he
had
never
heard
her
voice
again
so
he
passed
down
the
windy
wooden
stairs
lantern
hanging
lighted
in
his
hand
and
stepped
out
into
the
storm
through
sheets
of
drifting
snow
over
heaps
of
frozen
seaweed
and
icy
drift
he
moved
shifting
his
lantern
right
and
left
until
its
glimmer
on
the
water
warned
him
then
he
called
out
into
the
night
passeur
the
frozen
spray
spattered
his
face
and
crusted
the
lantern
he
heard
the
distant
boom
of
breakers
beyond
the
bar
and
the
noise
of
mighty
winds
among
the
seaward
cliffs
passeur
across
the
broad
flat
river
black
as
a
sea
of
pitch
a
tiny
light
sparkled
a
moment
again
he
cried
passeur
i
come
he
turned
ghastly
white
for
it
was
her
voice--or
was
he
crazy--and
he
sprang
waist
deep
into
the
icy
current
and
cried
out
again
but
his
voice
ended
in
a
sob
slowly
through
the
snow
the
flat
skiff
took
shape
creeping
nearer
and
nearer
but
she
was
not
at
the
pole--he
saw
that
there
was
only
a
tall
thin
man
shrouded
to
the
eyes
in
oilskin
and
he
leaped
into
the
boat
and
bade
the
ferryman
hasten
halfway
across
he
rose
in
the
skiff
and
called
jeanne
but
the
roar
of
the
storm
and
the
thrashing
of
icy
waves
drowned
his
voice
yet
he
heard
her
again
and
she
called
to
him
by
name
when
at
last
the
boat
grated
upon
the
invisible
shore
he
lifted
his
lantern
trembling
stumbling
among
the
rocks
and
calling
to
her
as
though
his
voice
could
silence
the
voice
that
had
spoken
a
year
ago
that
night
and
it
could
not
he
sank
shivering
upon
his
knees
and
looked
out
into
the
darkness
where
an
ocean
rolled
across
a
world
then
his
stiff
lips
moved
and
he
repeated
her
name
but
the
hand
of
the
ferryman
fell
gently
upon
his
head
and
when
he
raised
his
eyes
he
saw
that
the
ferryman
was
death
the
key
to
grief
the
moving
finger
writes
and
having
writ
moves
on
nor
all
your
piety
nor
wit
shall
lure
it
back
to
cancel
half
a
line
nor
all
your
tears
wash
out
a
word
of
it
fitzgerald
the
key
to
grief
the
wild
hawk
to
the
wind-swept
sky
the
deer
to
the
wholesome
wold
and
the
heart
of
a
man
to
the
heart
of
a
maid
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
old
kipling
i
they
were
doing
their
work
very
badly
they
got
the
rope
around
his
neck
and
tied
his
wrists
with
moose-bush
withes
but
again
he
fell
sprawling
turning
twisting
over
the
leaves
tearing
up
everything
around
him
like
a
trapped
panther
he
got
the
rope
away
from
them
he
clung
to
it
with
bleeding
fists
he
set
his
white
teeth
in
it
until
the
jute
strands
relaxed
unravelled
and
snapped
gnawed
through
by
his
white
teeth
twice
tully
struck
him
with
a
gum
hook
the
dull
blows
fell
on
flesh
rigid
as
stone
panting
foul
with
forest
mould
and
rotten
leaves
hands
and
face
smeared
with
blood
he
sat
up
on
the
ground
glaring
at
the
circle
of
men
around
him
shoot
him
gasped
tully
dashing
the
sweat
from
his
bronzed
brow
and
bates
breathing
heavily
sat
down
on
a
log
and
dragged
a
revolver
from
his
rear
pocket
the
man
on
the
ground
watched
him
there
was
froth
in
the
corners
of
his
mouth
git
back
whispered
bates
but
his
voice
and
hand
trembled
kent
he
stammered
won't
ye
hang
the
man
on
the
ground
glared
ye've
got
to
die

he
urged
they
all
say
so
ask

got
to
swing

it--ain't
he
tully--kent

sake

here
gents
the
man
on
the
ground
panted
his
bright
eyes
never
moved
after
a
moment
tully
sprang
on
him
again
there
was
a
flurry
of
leaves
a
crackle
a
gasp
and
a
grunt
then
the
thumping
and
thrashing
of
two
bodies
writhing
in
the
brush
dyce
and
carrots
jumped
on
the
prostrate
men
lefty
sawyer
caught
the
rope
again
but
the
jute
strands
gave
way
and
he
stumbled
tully
began
to
scream
he's
chokin'
me
dyce
staggered
out
into
the
open
moaning
over
a
broken
wrist
shoot
shouted
lefty
sawyer
and
dragged
tully
aside
shoot
jim
bates
shoot
straight
b'
god

gasped
bates
rising
from
the
fallen
log
the
crowd
parted
right
and
left
a
quick
report
rang
out--another--another
then
from
the
whirl
of
smoke
a
tall
form
staggered
dealing
blows--blows
that
sounded
sharp
as
the
crack
of
a
whip
he's
off
shoot
straight
they
cried
there
was
a
gallop
of
heavy
boots
in
the
woods
bates
faint
and
dazed
turned
his
head
shoot
shrieked
tully
but
bates
was
sick
his
smoking
revolver
fell
to
the
ground
his
white
face
and
pale
eyes
contracted
it
lasted
only
a
moment
he
started
after
the
others
plunging
wallowing
through
thickets
of
osier
and
hemlock
underbrush
far
ahead
he
heard
kent
crashing
on
like
a
young
moose
in
november
and
he
knew
he
was
making
for
the
shore
the
others
knew
too
already
the
gray
gleam
of
the
sea
cut
a
straight
line
along
the
forest
edge
already
the
soft
clash
of
the
surf
on
the
rocks
broke
faintly
through
the
forest
silence
he's
got
a
canoe
there
bawled
tully
he'll
be
into
it
and
he
was
into
it
kneeling
in
the
bow
driving
his
paddle
to
the
handle
the
rising
sun
gleamed
like
red
lightning
on
the
flashing
blade
the
canoe
shot
to
the
crest
of
a
wave
hung
bows
dripping
in
the
wind
dropped
into
the
depths
glided
tipped
rolled
shot
up
again
staggered
and
plunged
on
tully
ran
straight
out
into
the
cove
surf
the
water
broke
against
his
chest
bare
and
wet
with
sweat
bates
sat
down
on
a
worn
black
rock
and
watched
the
canoe
listlessly
the
canoe
dwindled
to
a
speck
of
gray
and
silver
and
when
carrots
who
had
run
back
to
the
gum
camp
for
a
rifle
returned
the
speck
on
the
water
might
have
been
easier
to
hit
than
a
loon's
head
at
twilight
so
carrots
being
thrifty
by
nature
fired
once
and
was
satisfied
to
save
the
other
cartridges
the
canoe
was
still
visible
making
for
the
open
sea
somewhere
beyond
the
horizon
lay
the
keys
a
string
of
rocks
bare
as
skulls
black
and
slimy
where
the
sea
cut
their
base
white
on
the
crests
with
the
excrement
of
sea
birds
he's
makin'
fur
the
key
to
grief
whispered
bates
to
dyce
dyce
moaning
and
nursing
his
broken
wrist
turned
a
sick
face
out
to
sea
the
last
rock
seaward
was
the
key
to
grief
a
splintered
pinnacle
polished
by
the
sea
from
the
key
to
grief
seaward
a
day's
paddle
if
a
man
dared
lay
the
long
wooded
island
in
the
ocean
known
as
grief
on
the
charts
of
the
bleak
coast
in
the
history
of
the
coast
two
men
had
made
the
voyage
to
the
key
to
grief
and
from
there
to
the
island
one
of
these
was
a
rum-crazed
pelt
hunter
who
lived
to
come
back
the
other
was
a
college
youth
they
found
his
battered
canoe
at
sea
and
a
day
later
his
battered
body
was
flung
up
in
the
cove
so
when
bates
whispered
to
dyce
and
when
dyce
called
to
the
others
they
knew
that
the
end
was
not
far
off
for
kent
and
his
canoe
and
they
turned
away
into
the
forest
sullen
but
satisfied
that
kent
would
get
his
dues
when
the
devil
got
his
lefty
spoke
vaguely
of
the
wages
of
sin
carrots
with
an
eye
to
thrift
suggested
a
plan
for
an
equitable
division
of
kent's
property
when
they
reached
the
gum
camp
they
piled
kent's
personal
effects
on
a
blanket
carrots
took
the
inventory
a
revolver
two
gum
hooks
a
fur
cap
a
nickel-plated
watch
a
pipe
a
pack
of
new
cards
a
gum
sack
forty
pounds
of
spruce
gum
and
a
frying
pan
carrots
shuffled
the
cards
picked
out
the
joker
and
flipped
it
pensively
into
the
fire
then
he
dealt
cold
decks
all
around
when
the
goods
and
chattels
of
their
late
companion
had
been
divided
by
chance--for
there
was
no
chance
to
cheat--somebody
remembered
tully
he's
down
there
on
the
coast
starin'
after
the
canoe
said
bates
huskily
he
rose
and
walked
toward
a
heap
on
the
ground
covered
by
a
blanket
he
started
to
lift
the
blanket
hesitated
and
finally
turned
away
under
the
blanket
lay
tully's
brother
shot
the
night
before
by
kent
guess
we'd
better
wait
till
tully
comes
said
carrots
uneasily
bates
and
kent
had
been
campmates
an
hour
later
tully
walked
into
camp
he
spoke
to
no
one
that
day
in
the
morning
bates
found
him
down
on
the
coast
digging
and
said
hello
tully
guess
we
ain't
much
hell
on
lynchin'
naw
said
tully

spade

to
plant

face
where
he

cried
tully
fiercely
he--he
can't

bates
uneasily
he's
dead
ain't
he
he'll
heave
up
that
there
sand
when
the
canoe
comes
back
an'
it's
a-comin'
an'
bud
kent'll
be
in
it
dead
or
alive
git
a
spade
the
pale
light
of
superstition
flickered
in
bates's
eyes
he
hesitated
the--the
dead
can't
see
he
began
kin
they
tully
turned
a
distorted
face
toward
him
yer
lie
he
roared

brother

livin'

when
the
canoe

in
i'll
hear
him
i'll
be
here
an'
we'll
live
to
see
the
hangin'
of
bud
kent
about
sundown
they
planted
tully's
brother
face
to
the
sea
ii
on
the
key
to
grief
the
green
waves
rub
all
day
white
at
the
summit
black
at
the
base
the
shafted
rocks
rear
splintered
pinnacles
slanting
like
channel
buoys
on
the
polished
pillars
sea
birds
brood--white-winged
bright-eyed
sea
birds
that
nestle
and
preen
and
flap
and
clatter
their
orange-coloured
beaks
when
the
sifted
spray
drives
and
drifts
across
the
reef
as
the
sun
rose
painting
crimson
streaks
criss-cross
over
the
waters
the
sea
birds
sidled
together
huddling
row
on
row
steeped
in
downy
drowse
where
the
sun
of
noon
burnished
the
sea
an
opal
wave
washed
listless
noiseless
a
sea
bird
stretched
one
listless
wing
and
into
the
silence
of
the
waters
a
canoe
glided
bronzed
by
the
sunlight
jewelled
by
the
salt
drops
stringing
from
prow
to
thwart
seaweed
a-trail
in
the
diamond-flashing
wake
and
in
the
bow
a
man
dripping
with
sweat
up
rose
the
gulls
sweeping
in
circles
turning
turning
over
rock
and
sea
and
their
clamour
filled
the
sky
starting
little
rippling
echoes
among
the
rocks
the
canoe
grated
on
a
shelf
of
ebony
the
seaweed
rocked
and
washed
the
little
sea
crabs
sheered
sideways
down
down
into
limpid
depths
of
greenest
shadows
such
was
the
coming
of
bud
kent
to
the
key
to
grief
he
drew
the
canoe
halfway
up
the
shelf
of
rock
and
sat
down
breathing
heavily
one
brown
arm
across
the
bow
for
an
hour
he
sat
there
the
sweat
dried
under
his
eyes
the
sea
birds
came
back
filling
the
air
with
soft
querulous
notes
there
was
a
livid
mark
around
his
neck
a
red
raw
circle
the
salt
wind
stung
it
the
sun
burned
it
into
his
flesh
like
a
collar
of
red-hot
steel
he
touched
it
at
times
once
he
washed
it
with
cold
salt
water
far
in
the
north
a
curtain
of
mist
hung
on
the
sea
dense
motionless
as
the
fog
on
the
grand
banks
he
never
moved
his
eyes
from
it
he
knew
what
it
was
behind
it
lay
the
island
of
grief
all
the
year
round
the
island
of
grief
is
hidden
by
the
banks
of
mist
ramparts
of
dead
white
fog
encircling
it
on
every
side
ships
give
it
wide
berth
some
speak
of
warm
springs
on
the
island
whose
waters
flow
far
out
to
sea
rising
in
steam
eternally
the
pelt
hunter
had
come
back
with
tales
of
forests
and
deer
and
flowers
everywhere
but
he
had
been
drinking
much
and
much
was
forgiven
him
the
body
of
the
college
youth
tossed
up
in
the
cove
on
the
mainland
was
battered
out
of
recognition
but
some
said
when
found
one
hand
clutched
a
crimson
blossom
half
wilted
but
broad
as
a
sap
pan
so
kent
lay
motionless
beside
his
canoe
burned
with
thirst
every
nerve
vibrating
thinking
of
all
these
things
it
was
not
fear
that
whitened
the
firm
flesh
under
the
tan
it
was
the
fear
of
fear
he
must
not
think--he
must
throttle
dread
his
eyes
must
never
falter
his
head
never
turn
from
that
wall
of
mist
across
the
sea
with
set
teeth
he
crushed
back
terror
with
glittering
eyes
he
looked
into
the
hollow
eyes
of
fright
and
so
he
conquered
fear
he
rose
the
sea
birds
whirled
up
into
the
sky
pitching
tossing
screaming
till
the
sharp
flapping
of
their
pinions
set
the
snapping
echoes
flying
among
the
rocks
under
the
canoe's
sharp
prow
the
kelp
bobbed
and
dipped
and
parted
the
sunlit
waves
ran
out
ahead
glittering
dancing
splash
splash
bow
and
stern
and
now
he
knelt
again
and
the
polished
paddle
swung
and
dipped
and
swept
and
swung
and
dipped
again
far
behind
the
clamour
of
the
sea
birds
lingered
in
his
ears
till
the
mellow
dip
of
the
paddle
drowned
all
sound
and
the
sea
was
a
sea
of
silence
no
wind
came
to
cool
the
hot
sweat
on
cheek
and
breast
the
sun
blazed
a
path
of
flame
before
him
and
he
followed
out
into
the
waste
of
waters
the
still
ocean
divided
under
the
bows
and
rippled
innocently
away
on
either
side
tinkling
foaming
sparkling
like
the
current
in
a
woodland
brook
he
looked
around
at
the
world
of
flattened
water
and
the
fear
of
fear
rose
up
and
gripped
his
throat
again
then
he
lowered
his
head
like
a
tortured
bull
and
shook
the
fear
of
fear
from
his
throat
and
drove
the
paddle
into
the
sea
as
a
butcher
stabs
to
the
hilt
so
at
last
he
came
to
the
wall
of
mist
it
was
thin
at
first
thin
and
cool
but
it
thickened
and
grew
warmer
and
the
fear
of
fear
dragged
at
his
head
but
he
would
not
look
behind
into
the
fog
the
canoe
shot
the
gray
water
ran
by
high
as
the
gunwales
oily
silent
shapes
flickered
across
the
bows
pillars
of
mist
that
rode
the
waters
robed
in
films
of
tattered
shadows
gigantic
forms
towered
to
dizzy
heights
above
him
shaking
out
shredded
shrouds
of
cloud
the
vast
draperies
of
the
fog
swayed
and
hung
and
trembled
as
he
brushed
them
the
white
twilight
deepened
to
a
sombre
gloom
and
now
it
grew
thinner
the
fog
became
a
mist
and
the
mist
a
haze
and
the
haze
floated
away
and
vanished
into
the
blue
of
the
heavens
all
around
lay
a
sea
of
pearl
and
sapphire
lapping
lapping
on
a
silver
shoal
so
he
came
to
the
island
of
grief
iii
on
the
silver
shoal
the
waves
washed
and
washed
breaking
like
crushed
opals
where
the
sands
sang
with
the
humming
froth
troops
of
little
shore
birds
wading
on
the
shoal
tossed
their
sun-tipped
wings
and
scuttled
inland
where
dappled
with
shadow
from
the
fringing
forest
the
white
beach
of
the
island
stretched
the
water
all
around
was
shallow
limpid
as
crystal
and
he
saw
the
ribbed
sand
shining
on
the
bottom
where
purple
seaweed
floated
and
delicate
sea
creatures
darted
and
swarmed
and
scattered
again
at
the
dip
of
his
paddle
like
velvet
rubbed
on
velvet
the
canoe
brushed
across
the
sand
he
staggered
to
his
feet
stumbled
out
dragged
the
canoe
high
up
under
the
trees
turned
it
bottom
upward
and
sank
beside
it
face
downward
in
the
sand
sleep
came
to
drive
away
the
fear
of
fear
but
hunger
thirst
and
fever
fought
with
sleep
and
he
dreamed--dreamed
of
a
rope
that
sawed
his
neck
of
the
fight
in
the
woods
and
the
shots
he
dreamed
too
of
the
camp
of
his
forty
pounds
of
spruce
gum
of
tully
and
of
bates
he
dreamed
of
the
fire
and
the
smoke-scorched
kettle
of
the
foul
odour
of
musty
bedding
of
the
greasy
cards
and
of
his
own
new
pack
hoarded
for
weeks
to
please
the
others
all
this
he
dreamed
lying
there
face
downward
in
the
sand
but
he
did
not
dream
of
the
face
of
the
dead
the
shadows
of
the
leaves
moved
on
his
blonde
head
crisp
with
clipped
curls
a
butterfly
flitted
around
him
alighting
now
on
his
legs
now
on
the
back
of
his
bronzed
hands
all
the
afternoon
the
bees
hung
droning
among
the
wildwood
blossoms
the
leaves
above
scarcely
rustled
the
shore
birds
brooded
along
the
water's
edge
the
thin
tide
sleeping
on
the
sand
mirrored
the
sky
twilight
paled
the
zenith
a
breeze
moved
in
the
deeper
woods
a
star
glimmered
went
out
glimmered
again
faded
and
glimmered
night
came
a
moth
darted
to
and
fro
under
the
trees
a
beetle
hummed
around
a
heap
of
seaweed
and
fell
scrambling
in
the
sand
somewhere
among
the
trees
a
sound
had
become
distinct
the
song
of
a
little
brook
melodious
interminable
he
heard
it
in
his
dream
it
threaded
all
his
dreams
like
a
needle
of
silver
and
like
a
needle
it
pricked
him--pricked
his
dry
throat
and
cracked
lips
it
could
not
awake
him
the
cool
night
swathed
him
head
and
foot
toward
dawn
a
bird
woke
up
and
piped
other
birds
stirred
restless
half
awakened
a
gull
spread
a
cramped
wing
on
the
shore
preened
its
feathers
scratched
its
tufted
neck
and
took
two
drowsy
steps
toward
the
sea
the
sea
breeze
stirred
out
behind
the
mist
bank
it
raised
the
feathers
on
the
sleeping
gulls
it
set
the
leaves
whispering
a
twig
snapped
broke
off
and
fell
kent
stirred
sighed
trembled
and
awoke
the
first
thing
he
heard
was
the
song
of
the
brook
and
he
stumbled
straight
into
the
woods
there
it
lay
a
thin
deep
stream
in
the
gray
morning
light
and
he
stretched
himself
beside
it
and
laid
his
cheek
in
it
a
bird
drank
in
the
pool
too--a
little
fluffy
bird
bright-eyed
and
fearless
his
knees
were
firmer
when
at
last
he
rose
heedless
of
the
drops
that
beaded
lips
and
chin
with
his
knife
he
dug
and
scraped
at
some
white
roots
that
hung
half
meshed
in
the
bank
of
the
brook
and
when
he
had
cleaned
them
in
the
pool
he
ate
them
the
sun
stained
the
sky
when
he
went
down
to
the
canoe
but
the
eternal
curtain
of
fog
far
out
at
sea
hid
it
as
yet
from
sight
he
lifted
the
canoe
bottom
upwards
to
his
head
and
paddle
and
pole
in
either
hand
carried
it
into
the
forest
after
he
had
set
it
down
he
stood
a
moment
opening
and
shutting
his
knife
then
he
looked
up
into
the
trees
there
were
birds
there
if
he
could
get
at
them
he
looked
at
the
brook
there
were
the
prints
of
his
fingers
in
the
sand
there
too
was
the
print
of
something
else--a
deer's
pointed
hoof
he
had
nothing
but
his
knife
he
opened
it
again
and
looked
at
it
that
day
he
dug
for
clams
and
ate
them
raw
he
waded
out
into
the
shallows
too
and
jabbed
at
fish
with
his
setting
pole
but
hit
nothing
except
a
yellow
crab
fire
was
what
he
wanted
he
hacked
and
chipped
at
flinty-looking
pebbles
and
scraped
tinder
from
a
stick
of
sun-dried
driftwood
his
knuckles
bled
but
no
fire
came
that
night
he
heard
deer
in
the
woods
and
could
not
sleep
for
thinking
until
the
dawn
came
up
behind
the
wall
of
mist
and
he
rose
with
it
to
drink
his
fill
at
the
brook
and
tear
raw
clams
with
his
white
teeth
again
he
fought
for
fire
craving
it
as
he
had
never
craved
water
but
his
knuckles
bled
and
the
knife
scraped
on
the
flint
in
vain
his
mind
perhaps
had
suffered
somewhat
the
white
beach
seemed
to
rise
and
fall
like
a
white
carpet
on
a
gusty
hearth
the
birds
too
that
ran
along
the
sand
seemed
big
and
juicy
like
partridges
and
he
chased
them
hurling
shells
and
bits
of
driftwood
at
them
till
he
could
scarcely
keep
his
feet
for
the
rising
plunging
beach--or
carpet
whichever
it
was
that
night
the
deer
aroused
him
at
intervals
he
heard
them
splashing
and
grunting
and
crackling
along
the
brook
once
he
arose
and
stole
after
them
knife
in
hand
till
a
false
step
into
the
brook
awoke
him
to
his
folly
and
he
felt
his
way
back
to
the
canoe
trembling
morning
came
and
again
he
drank
at
the
brook
lying
on
the
sand
where
countless
heart-shaped
hoofs
had
passed
leaving
clean
imprints
and
again
he
ripped
the
raw
clams
from
their
shells
and
swallowed
them
whimpering
all
day
long
the
white
beach
rose
and
fell
and
heaved
and
flattened
under
his
bright
dry
eyes
he
chased
the
shore
birds
at
times
till
the
unsteady
beach
tripped
him
up
and
he
fell
full
length
in
the
sand
then
he
would
rise
moaning
and
creep
into
the
shadow
of
the
wood
and
watch
the
little
song-birds
in
the
branches
moaning
always
moaning
his
hands
sticky
with
blood
hacked
steel
and
flint
together
but
so
feebly
that
now
even
the
cold
sparks
no
longer
came
he
began
to
fear
the
advancing
night
he
dreaded
to
hear
the
big
warm
deer
among
the
thickets
fear
clutched
him
suddenly
and
he
lowered
his
head
and
set
his
teeth
and
shook
fear
from
his
throat
again
then
he
started
aimlessly
into
the
woods
crowding
past
bushes
scraping
trees
treading
on
moss
and
twig
and
mouldy
stump
his
bruised
hands
swinging
always
swinging
the
sun
set
in
the
mist
as
he
came
out
of
the
woods
on
to
another
beach--a
warm
soft
beach
crimsoned
by
the
glow
in
the
evening
clouds
and
on
the
sand
at
his
feet
lay
a
young
girl
asleep
swathed
in
the
silken
garment
of
her
own
black
hair
round
limbed
brown
smooth
as
the
bloom
on
the
tawny
beach
a
gull
flapped
overhead
screaming
her
eyes
deeper
than
night
unclosed
then
her
lips
parted
in
a
cry
soft
with
sleep
ihã³
she
rose
rubbing
her
velvet
eyes
ihã³
she
cried
in
wonder
inã¢h
the
gilded
sand
settled
around
her
little
feet
her
cheeks
crimsoned
e-hã³
e-hã³
she
whispered
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hair
iv
the
bridge
of
the
stars
spans
the
sky
seas
the
sun
and
the
moon
are
the
travellers
who
pass
over
it
this
was
also
known
in
the
lodges
of
the
isantee
hundreds
of
years
ago
chaskã©
told
it
to
hã¢rpam
and
when
hã¢rpam
knew
he
told
it
to
hapã©da
and
so
the
knowledge
spread
to
hã¢rka
and
from
winona
to
wehã¢rka
up
and
down
across
and
ever
across
woof
and
web
until
it
came
to
the
island
of
grief
and
how
god

wehã¢rka
prattling
in
the
tules
may
have
told
ne-kã¢
and
ne-kã¢
high
in

may
have
told
kay-ã³shk
who
told
it
to

who
told
it
to
skeã©-skah
who
told
it
to
sã©-sã³-kah
ihã³
inã¢h
behold
the
wonder
of
it
and
this
is
the
fate
of
all
knowledge
that
comes
to
the
island
of
grief





as
the
red
glow
died
in
the
sky
and
the
sand
swam
in
shadows
the
girl
parted
the
silken
curtains
of
her
hair
and
looked
at
him
ehã³
she
whispered
again
in
soft
delight
for
now
it
was
plain
to
her
that
he
was
the
sun
he
had
crossed
the
bridge
of
stars
in
the
blue
twilight
he
had
come
e-tã³
she
stepped
nearer
shivering
faint
with
the
ecstasy
of
this
holy
miracle
wrought
before
her
he
was
the
sun
his
blood
streaked
the
sky
at
dawn
his
blood
stained
the
clouds
at
even
in
his
eyes
the
blue
of
the
sky
still
lingered
smothering
two
blue
stars
and
his
body
was
as
white
as
the
breast
of
the
moon
she
opened
both
arms
hands
timidly
stretched
palm
upward
her
face
was
raised
to
his
her
eyes
slowly
closed
the
deep-fringed
lids
trembled
like
a
young
priestess
she
stood
motionless
save
for
the
sudden
quiver
of
a
limb
a
quick
pulse-flutter
in
the
rounded
throat
and
so
she
worshipped
naked
and
unashamed
even
after
he
reeling
fell
heavily
forward
on
his
face
even
when
the
evening
breeze
stealing
over
the
sands
stirred
the
hair
on
his
head
as
winds
stir
the
fur
of
a
dead
animal
in
the
dust





when
the
morning
sun
peered
over
the
wall
of
mist
and
she
saw
it
was
the
sun
and
she
saw
him
flung
on
the
sand
at
her
feet
then
she
knew
that
he
was
a
man
only
a
man
pallid
as
death
and
smeared
with
blood
and
yet--miracle
of
miracles--the
divine
wonder
in
her
eyes
deepened
and
her
body
seemed
to
swoon
and
fall
a-trembling
and
swoon
again
for
although
it
was
but
a
man
who
lay
at
her
feet
it
had
been
easier
for
her
to
look
upon
a
god
he
dreamed
that
he
breathed
fire--fire
that
he
craved
as
he
had
never
craved
water
mad
with
delirium
he
knelt
before
the
flames
rubbing
his
torn
hands
washing
them
in
the
crimson-scented
flames
he
had
water
too
cool
scented
water
that
sprayed
his
burning
flesh
that
washed
in
his
eyes
his
hair
his
throat
after
that
came
hunger
a
fierce
rending
agony
that
scorched
and
clutched
and
tore
at
his
entrails
but
that
too
died
away
and
he
dreamed
that
he
had
eaten
and
all
his
flesh
was
warm
then
he
dreamed
that
he
slept
and
when
he
slept
he
dreamed
no
more
one
day
he
awoke
and
found
her
stretched
beside
him
soft
palms
tightly
closed
smiling
asleep
v
now
the
days
began
to
run
more
swiftly
than
the
tide
along
the
tawny
beach
and
the
nights
star-dusted
and
blue
came
and
vanished
and
returned
only
to
exhale
at
dawn
like
perfume
from
a
violet
they
counted
hours
as
they
counted
the
golden
bubbles
winking
with
a
million
eyes
along
the
foam-flecked
shore
and
the
hours
ended
and
began
and
glimmered
iridescent
and
ended
as
bubbles
end
in
a
tiny
rainbow
haze
there
was
still
fire
in
the
world
it
flashed
up
at
her
touch
and
where
she
chose
a
bow
strung
with
the
silk
of
her
own
hair
an
arrow
winged
like
a
sea
bird
and
tipped
with
shell
a
line
from
the
silver
tendon
of
a
deer
a
hook
of
polished
bone--these
were
the
mysteries
he
learned
and
learned
them
laughing
her
silken
head
bent
close
to
his
the
first
night
that
the
bow
was
wrought
and
the
glossy
string
attuned
she
stole
into
the
moonlit
forest
to
the
brook
and
there
they
stood
whispering
listening
and
whispering
though
neither
understood
the
voice
they
loved
in
the
deeper
woods
kaug
the
porcupine
scraped
and
snuffed
they
heard
wabã³se
the
rabbit
pit-a-pat
pit-a-pat
loping
across
dead
leaves
in
the
moonlight
skeã©-skah
the
wood-duck
sailed
past
noiseless
gorgeous
as
a
floating
blossom
out
on
the
ocean's
placid
silver
shinge-bis
the
diver
shook
the
scented
silence
with
his
idle
laughter
till
kay-ã³shk
the
gray
gull
stirred
in
his
slumber
there
came
a
sudden
ripple
in
the
stream
a
mellow
splash
a
soft
sound
on
the
sand
ihã³
behold
i
see
nothing
the
beloved
voice
was
only
a
wordless
melody
to
her
ihã³
ta-hinca
the
red
deer
e-hã³
the
buck
will
follow
ta-hinca
he
repeated
notching
the
arrow
e-tã³
ta-mdã³ka
so
he
drew
the
arrow
to
the
head
and
the
gray
gull
feathers
brushed
his
ear
and
the
darkness
hummed
with
the
harmony
of
the
singing
string
thus
died
ta-mdã³ka
the
buck
deer
of
seven
prongs
vi
as
an
apple
tossed
spinning
into
the
air
so
spun
the
world
above
the
hand
that
tossed
it
into
space
and
one
day
in
early
spring
sã©-sã³-kah
the
robin
awoke
at
dawn
and
saw
a
girl
at
the
foot
of
the
blossoming
tree
holding
a
babe
cradled
in
the
silken
sheets
of
her
hair
at
its
feeble
cry
kaug
the
porcupine
raised
his
quilled
head
wabã³se
the
rabbit
sat
still
with
palpitating
sides
kay-ã³shk
the
gray
gull
tiptoed
along
the
beach
kent
knelt
with
one
bronzed
arm
around
them
both
ihã³
inã¢h
whispered
the
girl
and
held
the
babe
up
in
the
rosy
flames
of
dawn
but
kent
trembled
as
he
looked
and
his
eyes
filled
on
the
pale
green
moss
their
shadows
lay--three
shadows
but
the
shadow
of
the
babe
was
white
as
froth
because
it
was
the
firstborn
son
they
named
it
chaskã©
and
the
girl
sang
as
she
cradled
it
there
in
the
silken
vestments
of
her
hair
all
day
long
in
the
sunshine
she
sang

out
in
the
calm
ocean
shinge-bis
the
diver
listened
preening
his
satin
breast
in
silence
in
the
forest
ta-hinca
the
red
deer
turned
her
delicate
head
to
the
wind
that
night
kent
thought
of
the
dead
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
come
to
the
key
of
grief
akã©-u
akã©-u
chirped
sã©-sã³-kah
the
robin
but
the
dead
never
come
again
beloved
sit
close
to
us
whispered
the
girl
watching
his
troubled
eyes
ma-cã¢nte
masã©ca
but
he
looked
at
the
babe
and
its
white
shadow
on
the
moss
and
he
only
sighed
ma-cã¢nte
masã©ca
beloved
death
sits
watching
us
across
the
sea
now
for
the
first
time
he
knew
more
than
the
fear
of
fear
he
knew
fear
and
with
fear
came
grief
he
never
before
knew
that
grief
lay
hidden
there
in
the
forest
now
he
knew
it
still
that
happiness
eternally
reborn
when
two
small
hands
reached
up
around
his
neck
when
feeble
fingers
clutched
his
hand--that
happiness
that
sã©-sã³-kah
understood
chirping
to
his
brooding
mate--that
ta-mdã³ka
knew
licking
his
dappled
fawns--that
happiness
gave
him
heart
to
meet
grief
calmly
in
dreams
or
in
the
forest
depths
and
it
helped
him
to
look
into
the
hollow
eyes
of
fear
he
often
thought
of
the
camp
now
of
bates
his
blanket
mate
of
dyce
whose
wrist
he
had
broken
with
a
blow
of
tully
whose
brother
he
had
shot
he
even
seemed
to
hear
the
shot
the
sudden
report
among
the
hemlocks
again
he
saw
the
haze
of
smoke
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
tall
form
falling
through
the
bushes
he
remembered
every
minute
incident
of
the
trial
bates's
hand
laid
on
his
shoulder
tully
red-bearded
and
wild-eyed
demanding
his
death
while
dyce
spat
and
spat
and
smoked
and
kicked
at
the
blackened
log-ends
projecting
from
the
fire
he
remembered
too
the
verdict
and
tully's
terrible
laugh
and
the
new
jute
rope
that
they
stripped
off
the
market-sealed
gum
packs
he
thought
of
these
things
sometimes
wading
out
on
the
shoals
shell-tipped
fish
spear
poised
at
such
times
he
would
miss
his
fish
he
thought
of
it
sometimes
when
he
knelt
by
the
forest
stream
listening
for
ta-hinca's
splash
among
the
cresses
at
such
moments
the
feathered
shaft
whistled
far
from
the
mark
and
ta-mdã³ka
stamped
and
snorted
till
even
the
white
fisher
stretched
on
a
rotting
log
flattened
his
whiskers
and
stole
away
into
the
forest's
blackest
depths
when
the
child
was
a
year
old
hour
for
hour
notched
at
sunset
and
sunrise
it
prattled
with
the
birds
and
called
to
ne-kã¢
the
wild
goose
who
called
again
to
the
child
from
the
sky
northward
northward
beloved
when
winter
came--there
is
no
frost
on
the
island
of
grief--ne-kã¢
the
wild
goose
passing
high
in
the
clouds
called
southward
southward
beloved
and
the
child
answered
in
a
soft
whisper
of
an
unknown
tongue
till
the
mother
shivered
and
covered
it
with
her
silken
hair
o
beloved
said
the
girl
chaskã©
calls
to
all
things
living--to
kaug
the
porcupine
to
wabã³se
to
kay-ã³shk
the
gray
gull--he
calls
and
they
understand
kent
bent
and
looked
into
her
eyes
hush
beloved
it
is
not
that
i
fear
then
what
beloved
his
shadow
it
is
white
as
surf
foam
and
at
night--i--i
have
seen----
oh
what
the
air
about
him
aglow
like
a
pale
rose
ma
cã¢ntã©
masã©ca
the
earth
alone
lasts
i
speak
as
one
dying--i
know
o
beloved
her
voice
died
away
like
a
summer
wind
beloved
he
cried
but
there
before
him
she
was
changing
the
air
grew
misty
and
her
hair
wavered
like
shreds
of
fog
and
her
slender
form
swayed
and
faded
and
swerved
like
the
mist
above
a
pond
in
her
arms
the
babe
was
a
figure
of
mist
rosy
vague
as
a
breath
on
a
mirror
the
earth
alone
lasts
inã¢h
it
is
the
end
o
beloved
the
words
came
from
the
mist--a
mist
as
formless
as
the
ether--a
mist
that
drove
in
and
crowded
him
that
came
from
the
sea
from
the
clouds
from
the
earth
at
his
feet
faint
with
terror
he
staggered
forward
calling
beloved
and
thou
chaskã©
o
beloved
akã©
u
akã©
u
far
out
at
sea
a
rosy
star
glimmered
an
instant
in
the
mist
and
went
out
a
sea
bird
screamed
soaring
over
the
waste
of
fog-smothered
waters
again
he
saw
the
rosy
star
it
came
nearer
its
reflection
glimmered
in
the
water
chaskã©
he
cried
he
heard
a
voice
dull
in
the
choking
mist
o
beloved
i
am
here
he
called
again
there
was
a
sound
on
the
shoal
a
flicker
in
the
fog
the
flare
of
a
torch
a
face
white
livid
terrible--the
face
of
the
dead
he
fell
upon
his
knees
he
closed
his
eyes
and
opened
them
tully
stood
beside
him
with
a
coil
of
rope

arabian
proverb
i
much
as
i
dislike
it
i
am
obliged
to
include
this
story
in
a
volume
devoted
to
fiction
i
have
attempted
to
tell
it
as
an
absolutely
true
story
but
until
three
months
ago
when
the
indisputable
proofs
were
placed
before
the
british
association
by
professor
james
holroyd
i
was
regarded
as
an
impostor
now
that
the
smithsonian
institute
in
washington
the
philadelphia
zoã¶logical
society
and
the
natural
history
museum
of
new
york
city
are
convinced
that
the
story
is
truthful
and
accurate
in
every
particular
i
prefer
to
tell
it
my
own
way
professor
holroyd
urges
me
to
do
this
although
professor
bruce
stoddard
of
columbia
college
is
now
at
work
upon
a
pamphlet
to
be
published
the
latter
part
of
next
month
describing
scientifically
the
extraordinary
discovery
which
to
the
shame
of
the
united
states
was
first
accepted
and
recognised
in
england
now
having
no
technical
ability
concerning
the
affair
in
question
and
having
no
knowledge
of
either
comparative
anatomy
or
zoã¶logy
i
am
perhaps
unfitted
to
tell
this
story
but
the
story
is
true
the
episode
occurred
under
my
own
eyes--here
within
a
few
hours'
sail
of
the
battery
and
as
i
was
one
of
the
first
persons
to
verify
what
has
long
been
a
theory
among
scientists
and
moreover
as
the
result
of
professor
holroyd's
discovery
is
to
be
placed
on
exhibition
in
madison
square
garden
on
the
twentieth
of
next
month
i
have
decided
to
tell
as
simply
as
i
am
able
exactly
what
occurred
i
first
wrote
out
the
story
on
april
1
1896
the
north
american
review
the
popular
science
monthly
the
scientific
american
nature
forest
and
stream
and
the
fossiliferous
magazine
in
turn
rejected
it
some
curtly
informing
me
that
fiction
had
no
place
in
their
columns
when
i
attempted
to
explain
that
it
was
not
fiction
the
editors
of
these
periodicals
either
maintained
a
contemptuous
silence
or
bluntly
notified
me
that
my
literary
services
and
opinions
were
not
desired
but
finally
when
several
publishers
offered
to
take
the
story
as
fiction
i
cut
short
all
negotiations
and
decided
to
publish
it
myself
where
i
am
known
at
all
it
is
my
misfortune
to
be
known
as
a
writer
of
fiction
this
makes
it
impossible
for
me
to
receive
a
hearing
from
a
scientific
audience
i
regret
it
bitterly
because
now
when
it
is
too
late
i
am
prepared
to
prove
certain
scientific
matters
of
interest
and
to
produce
the
proofs
in
this
case
however
i
am
fortunate
for
nobody
can
dispute
the
existence
of
a
thing
when
the
bodily
proof
is
exhibited
as
evidence
this
is
the
story
and
if
i
write
it
as
i
write
fiction
it
is
because
i
do
not
know
how
to
write
it
otherwise
i
was
walking
along
the
beach
below
pine
inlet
on
the
south
shore
of
long
island
the
railroad
and
telegraph
station
is
at
west
oyster
bay
everybody
who
has
travelled
on
the
long
island
railroad
knows
the
station
but
few
perhaps
know
pine
inlet
duck
shooters
of
course
are
familiar
with
it
but
as
there
are
no
hotels
there
and
nothing
to
see
except
salt
meadow
salt
creek
and
a
strip
of
dune
and
sand
the
summer-squatting
public
may
probably
be
unaware
of
its
existence
the
local
name
for
the
place
is
pine
inlet
the
maps
give
its
name
as
sand
point
i
believe
but
anybody
at
west
oyster
bay
can
direct
you
to
it
captain
mcpeek
who
keeps
the
west
oyster
bay
house
drives
duck
shooters
there
in
winter
it
lies
five
miles
southeast
from
west
oyster
bay
i
had
walked
over
that
afternoon
from
captain
mcpeek's
there
was
a
reason
for
my
going
to
pine
inlet--it
embarrasses
me
to
explain
it
but
the
truth
is
i
meditated
writing
an
ode
to
the
ocean
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
write
it
in
west
oyster
bay
with
the
whistle
of
locomotives
in
my
ears
i
knew
that
pine
inlet
was
one
of
the
loneliest
places
on
the
atlantic
coast
it
is
out
of
sight
of
everything
except
leagues
of
gray
ocean
rarely
one
might
make
out
fishing
smacks
drifting
across
the
horizon
summer
squatters
never
visited
it
sportsmen
shunned
it
except
in
winter
therefore
as
i
was
about
to
do
a
bit
of
poetry
i
thought
that
pine
inlet
was
the
spot
for
the
deed
so
i
went
there
as
i
was
strolling
along
the
beach
biting
my
pencil
reflectively
tremendously
impressed
by
the
solitude
and
the
solemn
thunder
of
the
surf
a
thought
occurred
to
me
how
unpleasant
it
would
be
if
i
suddenly
stumbled
on
a
summer
boarder
as
this
joyless
impossibility
flitted
across
my
mind
i
rounded
a
bleak
sand
dune
a
summer
girl
stood
directly
in
my
path
if
i
jumped
i
think
the
young
lady
has
pardoned
me
by
this
time
she
ought
to
because
she
also
started
and
said
something
in
a
very
faint
voice
what
she
said
was
oh
she
stared
at
me
as
though
i
had
just
crawled
up
out
of
the
sea
to
bite
her
i
don't
know
what
my
own
expression
resembled
but
i
have
been
given
to
understand
it
was
idiotic
now
i
perceived
after
a
few
moments
that
the
young
lady
was
frightened
and
i
knew
i
ought
to
say
something
civil
so
i
said
are
there
any
mosquitoes
here
no
she
replied
with
a
slight
quiver
in
her
voice
i
have
only
seen
one
and
it
was
biting
somebody
else
i
looked
foolish
the
conversation
seemed
so
futile
and
the
young
lady
appeared
to
be
more
nervous
than
before
i
had
an
impulse
to
say
do
not
run
i
have
breakfasted
for
she
seemed
to
be
meditating
a
plunge
into
the
breakers
what
i
did
say
was
i
did
not
know
anybody
was
here
i
do
not
intend
to
intrude
i
come
from
captain
mcpeek's
and
i
am
writing
an
ode
to
the
ocean
after
i
had
said
this
it
seemed
to
ring
in
my
ears
like
i
come
from
table
mountain
and
my
name
is
truthful
james
i
glanced
timidly
at
her
she's
thinking
of
the
same
thing
said
i
to
myself
what
an
ass
i
must
appear
however
the
young
lady
seemed
to
be
a
trifle
reassured
i
noticed
she
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
and
looked
at
my
shoes
she
looked
so
long
that
it
made
me
suspicious
and
i
also
examined
my
shoes
they
seemed
to
be
fairly
respectable
i--i
am
sorry
she
said
but
would
you
mind
not
walking
on
the
beach
this
was
sudden
i
had
intended
to
retire
and
leave
the
beach
to
her
but
i
did
not
fancy
being
driven
away
so
abruptly
i
was
about
to
withdraw
madam
said
i
bowing
stiffly
i
beg
you
will
pardon
any
inconvenience----
dear
me
she
cried
you
don't
understand
i
do
not--i
would
not
think
for
a
moment
of
asking
you
to
leave
pine
inlet
i
merely
ventured
to
request
you
to
walk
on
the
dunes
i
am
so
afraid
that
your
footprints
may
obliterate
the
impressions
that
my
father
is
studying
oh
said
i
looking
about
me
as
though
i
had
been
caught
in
the
middle
of
a
flower-bed
really
i
did
not
notice
any
impressions
impressions
of
what--if
i
may
be
permitted
i
don't
know
she
said
smiling
a
little
at
my
awkward
pose
if
you
step
this
way
in
a
straight
line
you
can
do
no
damage
i
did
as
she
bade
me
i
suppose
my
movements
resembled
the
gait
of
a
wet
peacock
possibly
they
recalled
the
delicate
manå“uvres
of
the
kangaroo
anyway
she
laughed
this
seriously
annoyed
me
i
had
been
at
a
disadvantage
i
walk
well
enough
when
let
alone
you
can
scarcely
expect
said
i
that
a
man
absorbed
in
his
own
ideas
could
notice
impressions
on
the
sand
i
trust
i
have
obliterated
nothing
as
i
said
this
i
looked
back
at
the
long
line
of
footprints
stretching
away
in
prospective
across
the
sand
they
were
my
own
how
large
they
looked
was
that
what
she
was
laughing
at
i
wish
to
explain
she
said
gravely
looking
at
the
point
of
her
parasol
i
am
very
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
warn
you--to
ask
you
to
forego
the
pleasure
of
strolling
on
a
beach
that
does
not
belong
to
me
perhaps
she
continued
in
sudden
alarm
perhaps
this
beach
belongs
to
you
the
beach
oh
no
i
said
but--but
you
were
going
to
write
poems
about
it
only
one--and
that
does
not
necessitate
owning
the
beach
i
have
observed
said
i
frankly
that
the
people
who
own
nothing
write
many
poems
about
it
she
looked
at
me
seriously
i
write
many
poems
i
added
she
laughed
doubtfully
would
you
rather
i
went
away
i
asked
politely
i
why
no--i
mean
that
you
may
do
as
you
please--except
please
do
not
walk
on
the
beach
then
i
do
not
alarm
you
by
my
presence
i
inquired
my
clothes
were
a
bit
ancient
i
wore
them
shooting
sometimes
my
family
is
respectable
i
added
and
i
told
her
my
name
oh
then
you
wrote
'culled
cowslips'
and
'faded
fig-leaves'
and
you
imitate
maeterlinck
and
you----
oh
i
know
lots
of
people
that
you
know
she
cried
with
every
symptom
of
relief
and
you
know
my
brother
i
am
the
author
said
i
coldly
of
'culled
cowslips'
but
'faded
fig-leaves'
was
an
earlier
work
which
i
no
longer
recognise
and
i
should
be
grateful
to
you
if
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
deny
that
i
ever
imitated
maeterlinck
possibly
i
added
he
imitates
me
now
do
you
know
she
said
i
was
afraid
of
you
at
first
papa
is
digging
in
the
salt
meadows
nearly
a
mile
away
it
was
hard
to
bear
can
you
not
see
said
i
that
i
am
wearing
a
shooting
coat
i
do
see--now
but
it
is
so--so
old
she
pleaded
it
is
a
shooting
coat
all
the
same
i
said
bitterly
she
was
very
quiet
and
i
saw
she
was
sorry
never
mind
i
said
magnanimously
you
probably
are
not
familiar
with
sporting
goods
if
i
knew
your
name
i
should
ask
permission
to
present
myself
why
i
am
daisy
holroyd
she
said
what
jack
holroyd's
little
sister
little
she
cried
i
didn't
mean
that
said
i
you
know
that
your
brother
and
i
were
great
friends
in
paris----
i
know
she
said
significantly
ahem
of
course
i
said
jack
and
i
were
inseparable----
except
when
shut
in
separate
cells
said
miss
holroyd
coldly
this
unfeeling
allusion
to
the
unfortunate
termination
of
a
latin-quarter
celebration
hurt
me
the
police
said
i
were
too
officious
so
jack
says
replied
miss
holroyd
demurely
we
had
unconsciously
moved
on
along
the
sand
hills
side
by
side
as
we
spoke
to
think
i
repeated
that
i
should
meet
jack's
little----
please
she
said
you
are
only
three
years
my
senior
she
opened
the
sunshade
and
tipped
it
over
one
shoulder
it
was
white
and
had
spots
and
posies
on
it
jack
sends
us
every
new
book
you
write
she
observed
i
do
not
approve
of
some
things
you
write
modern
school
i
mumbled
that
is
no
excuse
she
said
severely
anthony
trollope
didn't
do
it
the
foam
spume
from
the
breakers
was
drifting
across
the
dunes
and
the
little
tip-up
snipe
ran
along
the
beach
and
teetered
and
whistled
and
spread
their
white-barred
wings
for
a
low
straight
flight
across
the
shingle
only
to
tip
and
skeep
and
sail
on
again
the
salt
sea
wind
whistled
and
curled
through
the
crested
waves
blowing
in
perfumed
puffs
across
thickets
of
sweet
bay
and
cedar
as
we
passed
through
the
crackling
juicy-stemmed
marsh
weed
myriads
of
fiddler
crabs
raised
their
fore-claws
in
warning
and
backed
away
rustling
through
the
reeds
aggressive
protesting
like
millions
of
pigmy
ajaxes
defying
the
lightning
i
said
miss
holroyd
laughed
now
i
never
imagined
that
authors
were
clever
except
in
print
she
said
she
was
a
most
extraordinary
girl
i
suppose
she
observed
after
a
moment's
silence--i
suppose
i
am
taking
you
to
my
father
delighted
i
mumbled
h'm
i
had
the
honour
of
meeting
professor
holroyd
in
paris
yes
he
bailed
you
and
jack
out
said
miss
holroyd
serenely
the
silence
was
too
painful
to
last
captain
mcpeek
is
an
interesting
man
i
said
i
spoke
more
loudly
than
i
intended
i
may
have
been
nervous
yes
said
daisy
holroyd
but
he
has
a
most
singular
hotel
clerk
you
mean
mr
frisby
i
do
yes
i
admitted
mr
frisby
is
queer
he
was
once
a
bill-poster
i
know
it
exclaimed
daisy
holroyd
with
some
heat
he
ruins
landscapes
whenever
he
has
an
opportunity
do
you
know
that
he
has
a
passion
for
bill-posting
he
has
he
posts
bills
for
the
pure
pleasure
of
it
just
as
you
play
golf
or
tennis
or
billiards
but
he's
a
hotel
clerk
now
i
said
nobody
employs
him
to
post
bills
i
know
it
he
does
it
all
by
himself
for
the
pure
pleasure
of
it
papa
has
engaged
him
to
come
down
here
for
two
weeks
and
i
dread
it
said
the
girl
what
professor
holroyd
might
want
of
frisby
i
had
not
the
faintest
notion
i
suppose
miss
holroyd
noticed
the
bewilderment
in
my
face
for
she
laughed
and
nodded
her
head
twice
not
only
mr
frisby
but
captain
mcpeek
also
she
said
you
don't
mean
to
say
that
captain
mcpeek
is
going
to
close
his
hotel
i
exclaimed
my
trunk
was
there
it
contained
guarantees
of
my
respectability
oh
no
his
wife
will
keep
it
open
replied
the
girl
look
you
can
see
papa
now
he's
digging
where
i
blurted
out
i
remembered
professor
holroyd
as
a
prim
spectacled
gentleman
with
close-cut
snowy
beard
and
a
clerical
allure
the
man
i
saw
digging
wore
green
goggles
a
jersey
a
battered
sou'wester
and
hip-boots
of
rubber
he
was
delving
in
the
muck
of
the
salt
meadow
his
face
streaming
with
perspiration
his
boots
and
jersey
splashed
with
unpleasant-looking
mud
he
glanced
up
as
we
approached
shading
his
eyes
with
a
sunburnt
hand
papa
dear
said
miss
holroyd
here
is
jack's
friend
whom
you
bailed
out
of
mazas
the
introduction
was
startling
i
turned
crimson
with
mortification
the
professor
was
very
decent
about
it
he
called
me
by
name
at
once
when
he
said
this
he
looked
at
his
spade
it
was
clear
that
he
considered
me
a
nuisance
and
wished
to
go
on
with
his
digging
i
suppose
he
said
you
are
still
writing
a
little
i
replied
trying
not
to
speak
sarcastically
my
output
had
rivaled
that
of
the
duchess--in
quantity
i
mean
i
seldom
read--fiction
he
said
looking
restlessly
at
the
hole
in
the
ground
miss
holroyd
came
to
my
rescue
that
was
a
charming
story
you
wrote
last
she
said
papa
should
read
it--you
should
papa
it's
all
about
a
fossil
we
both
looked
narrowly
at
miss
holroyd
her
smile
was
guileless
fossils
repeated
the
professor
do
you
care
for
fossils
very
much
said
i
now
i
am
not
perfectly
sure
what
my
object
was
in
lying
i
looked
at
daisy
holroyd's
dark-fringed
eyes
they
were
very
grave
fossils
said
i
are
my
hobby
i
think
miss
holroyd
winced
a
little
at
this
i
did
not
care
i
went
on
i
have
seldom
had
the
opportunity
to
study
the
subject
but
as
a
boy
i
collected
flint
arrow-heads----
flint
arrow-heads
said
the
professor
coldly
yes
they
were
the
nearest
things
to
fossils
obtainable
i
replied
marvelling
at
my
own
mendacity
the
professor
looked
into
the
hole
i
also
looked
i
could
see
nothing
in
it
he's
digging
for
fossils
thought
i
to
myself
perhaps
said
the
professor
cautiously
you
might
wish
to
aid
me
in
a
little
research--that
is
to
say
if
you
have
an
inclination
for
fossils
the
double-entendre
was
not
lost
upon
me
i
have
read
all
your
books
so
eagerly
said
i
that
to
join
you
to
be
of
service
to
you
in
any
research
however
difficult
and
trying
would
be
an
honour
and
a
privilege
that
i
never
dared
to
hope
for
that
thought
i
to
myself
will
do
its
own
work
but
the
professor
was
still
suspicious
how
could
he
help
it
when
he
remembered
jack's
escapades
in
which
my
name
was
always
blended
doubtless
he
was
satisfied
that
my
influence
on
jack
was
evil
the
contrary
was
the
case
too
fossils
he
said
worrying
the
edges
of
the
excavation
with
his
spade
fossils
are
not
things
to
be
lightly
considered
no
indeed
i
protested
fossils
are
the
most
interesting
as
well
as
puzzling
things
in
the
world
said
he
they
are
i
cried
enthusiastically
but
i
am
not
looking
for
fossils
observed
the
professor
mildly
this
was
a
facer
i
looked
at
daisy
holroyd
she
bit
her
lip
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
sea
her
eyes
were
wonderful
eyes
did
you
think
i
was
digging
for
fossils
in
a
salt
meadow
queried
the
professor
you
can
have
read
very
little
about
the
subject
i
am
digging
for
something
quite
different
i
was
silent
i
knew
that
my
face
was
a
trifle
flushed
i
longed
to
say
well
what
the
devil
are
you
digging
for
but
i
only
stared
into
the
hole
as
though
hypnotized
captain
mcpeek
and
frisby
ought
to
be
here
he
said
looking
first
at
daisy
and
then
across
the
meadows
i
ached
to
ask
him
why
he
had
subpå“naed
captain
mcpeek
and
frisby
they
are
coming
said
daisy
shading
her
eyes
do
you
see
the
speck
on
the
meadows
it
may
be
a
mud
hen
said
the
professor
miss
holroyd
is
right
i
said
a
wagon
and
team
and
two
men
are
coming
from
the
north
there
is
a
dog
beside
the
wagon--it's
that
miserable
yellow
dog
of
frisby's
good
gracious
cried
the
professor
you
don't
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
see
all
that
at
such
a
distance
why
not
i
said
i
see
nothing
he
insisted
you
will
see
that
i'm
right
presently
i
laughed
the
professor
removed
his
blue
goggles
and
rubbed
them
glancing
obliquely
at
me
haven't
you
heard
what
extraordinary
eyesight
duck
shooters
have
said
his
daughter
looking
back
at
her
father
jack
says
that
they
can
tell
exactly
what
kind
of
a
duck
is
flying
before
most
people
could
see
anything
at
all
in
the
sky
it's
true
i
said
it
comes
to
anybody
i
fancy
who
has
had
practice
the
professor
regarded
me
with
a
new
interest
there
was
inspiration
in
his
eyes
he
turned
toward
the
ocean
for
a
long
time
he
stared
at
the
tossing
waves
on
the
beach
then
he
looked
far
out
to
where
the
horizon
met
the
sea
are
there
any
ducks
out
there
he
asked
at
last
yes
said
i
scanning
the
sea
there
are
he
produced
a
pair
of
binoculars
from
his
coat-tail
pocket
adjusted
them
and
raised
them
to
his
eyes
h'm
what
sort
of
ducks
i
looked
more
carefully
holding
both
hands
over
my
forehead
surf
ducks--scoters
and
widgeon
there
is
one
bufflehead
among
them--no
two
the
rest
are
coots
i
replied
this
cried
the
professor
is
most
astonishing
i
have
good
eyes
but
i
can't
see
a
blessed
thing
without
these
binoculars
it's
not
extraordinary
said
i
the
surf
ducks
and
coots
any
novice
might
recognise
the
widgeon
and
buffleheads
i
should
not
have
been
able
to
name
unless
they
had
risen
from
the
water
it
is
easy
to
tell
any
duck
when
it
is
flying
even
though
it
looks
no
bigger
than
a
black
pin-point
but
the
professor
insisted
that
it
was
marvellous
and
he
said
that
i
might
render
him
invaluable
service
if
i
would
consent
to
come
and
camp
at
pine
inlet
for
a
few
weeks
i
looked
at
his
daughter
but
she
turned
her
back--not
exactly
in
disdain
either
her
back
was
beautifully
moulded
her
gown
fitted
also
camp
out
here
i
repeated
pretending
to
be
unpleasantly
surprised
i
do
not
think
he
would
care
to
said
miss
holroyd
without
turning
i
had
not
expected
that
above
all
things
said
i
in
a
clear
pleasant
voice
i
like
to
camp
out
she
said
nothing
it
is
not
exactly
camping
said
the
professor
come
you
shall
see
our
conservatory
daisy
come
dear
you
must
put
on
a
heavier
frock
it
is
getting
toward
sundown
at
that
moment
over
a
near
dune
two
horses'
heads
appeared
followed
by
two
human
heads
then
a
wagon
then
a
yellow
dog
i
turned
triumphantly
to
the
professor
you
are
the
very
man
i
want
he
muttered
the
very
man--the
very
man
i
looked
at
daisy
holroyd
she
returned
my
glance
with
a
defiant
little
smile
waal
said
captain
mcpeek
driving
up
here
we
be
git
out
frisby
frisby
fat
nervous
and
sentimental
hopped
out
of
the
cart
come
said
the
professor
impatiently
moving
across
the
dunes
i
walked
with
daisy
holroyd
mcpeek
and
frisby
followed
the
yellow
dog
walked
by
himself
ii
the
sun
was
dipping
into
the
sea
as
we
trudged
across
the
meadows
toward
a
high
dome-shaped
dune
covered
with
cedars
and
thickets
of
sweet
bay
i
saw
no
sign
of
habitation
among
the
sand
hills
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
nothing
broke
the
gray
line
of
sea
and
sky
save
the
squat
dunes
crowned
with
stunted
cedars
then
as
we
rounded
the
base
of
the
dune
we
almost
walked
into
the
door
of
a
house
my
amazement
amused
miss
holroyd
and
i
noticed
also
a
touch
of
malice
in
her
pretty
eyes
but
she
said
nothing
following
her
father
into
the
house
with
the
slightest
possible
gesture
to
me
was
it
invitation
or
was
it
menace
the
house
was
merely
a
light
wooden
frame
covered
with
some
waterproof
stuff
that
looked
like
a
mixture
of
rubber
and
tar
over
this--in
fact
over
the
whole
roof--was
pitched
an
awning
of
heavy
sail-cloth
i
noticed
that
the
house
was
anchored
to
the
sand
by
chains
already
rusted
red
but
this
one-storied
house
was
not
the
only
building
nestling
in
the
south
shelter
of
the
big
dune
a
hundred
feet
away
stood
another
structure--long
low
also
built
of
wood
it
had
rows
on
rows
of
round
portholes
on
every
side
the
ports
were
fitted
with
heavy
glass
hinged
to
swing
open
if
necessary
a
single
big
double
door
occupied
the
front
behind
this
long
low
building
was
still
another
a
mere
shed
smoke
rose
from
the
sheet-iron
chimney
there
was
somebody
moving
about
inside
the
open
door
as
i
stood
gaping
at
this
mushroom
hamlet
the
professor
appeared
at
the
door
and
asked
me
to
enter
i
stepped
in
at
once
the
house
was
much
larger
than
i
had
imagined
a
straight
hallway
ran
through
the
centre
from
east
to
west
on
either
side
of
this
hallway
were
rooms
the
doors
swinging
wide
open
i
counted
three
doors
on
each
side
the
three
on
the
south
appeared
to
be
bedrooms
the
professor
ushered
me
into
a
room
on
the
north
side
where
i
found
captain
mcpeek
and
frisby
sitting
at
a
table
upon
which
were
drawings
and
sketches
of
articulated
animals
and
fishes
you
see
mcpeek
said
the
professor
we
only
wanted
one
more
man
and
i
think
i've
got
him--haven't
i
turning
eagerly
to
me
why
yes
i
said
laughing
this
is
delightful
am
i
invited
to
stay
here
your
bedroom
is
the
third
on
the
south
side
everything
is
ready
mcpeek
you
can
bring
his
trunk
to-morrow
can't
you
demanded
the
professor
the
red-faced
captain
nodded
and
shifted
a
quid
then
it's
all
settled
said
the
professor
and
he
drew
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
you
see
he
said
turning
to
me
i
was
at
my
wit's
end
to
know
whom
to
trust
i
never
thought
of
you
jack's
out
in
china
and
i
didn't
dare
trust
anybody
in
my
own
profession
all
you
care
about
is
writing
verses
and
stories
isn't
it
i
like
to
shoot
i
replied
mildly
just
the
thing
he
cried
beaming
at
us
all
in
turn
now
i
can
see
no
reason
why
we
should
not
progress
rapidly
mcpeek
you
and
frisby
must
get
those
boxes
up
here
before
dark
dinner
will
be
ready
before
you
have
finished
unloading
dick
you
will
wish
to
go
to
your
room
first
my
name
isn't
dick
but
he
spoke
so
kindly
and
beamed
upon
me
in
such
a
fatherly
manner
that
i
let
it
go
i
had
occasion
to
correct
him
afterward
several
times
but
he
always
forgot
the
next
minute
he
calls
me
dick
to
this
day
it
was
dark
when
professor
holroyd
his
daughter
and
i
sat
down
to
dinner
the
room
was
the
same
in
which
i
had
noticed
the
drawings
of
beast
and
bird
but
the
round
table
had
been
extended
into
an
oval
and
neatly
spread
with
dainty
linen
and
silver
a
fresh-cheeked
swedish
girl
appeared
from
a
further
room
bearing
the
soup
the
professor
ladled
it
out
still
beaming
now
this
is
very
delightful--isn't
it
daisy
he
said
very
said
miss
holroyd
with
the
faintest
tinge
of
irony
very
i
repeated
heartily
but
i
looked
at
my
soup
when
i
said
it
i
suppose
said
the
professor
nodding
mysteriously
at
his
daughter
that
dick
knows
nothing
of
what
we're
about
down
here
i
suppose
said
miss
holroyd
that
he
thinks
we
are
digging
for
fossils
i
looked
at
my
plate
she
might
have
spared
me
that
well
well
said
her
father
smiling
to
himself
he
shall
know
everything
by
morning
you'll
be
astonished
dick
my
boy
his
name
isn't
dick
corrected
daisy
the
professor
said
isn't
it
in
an
absent-minded
way
and
relapsed
into
contemplation
of
my
necktie
i
asked
miss
holroyd
a
few
questions
about
jack
and
was
informed
that
he
had
given
up
law
and
entered
the
diplomatic
service--as
what
i
did
not
dare
ask
for
i
know
what
our
diplomatic
service
is
in
china
said
daisy
choo
choo
is
the
name
of
the
city
added
her
father
proudly
it's
the
terminus
of
the
new
trans-siberian
railway
it's
on
the
yellow
river
said
daisy
he's
vice-consul
added
the
professor
triumphantly
he'll
make
a
good
one
i
observed
i
knew
jack
i
pitied
his
consul
so
we
chatted
on
about
my
old
playmate
until
freda
the
red-cheeked
maid
brought
coffee
and
the
professor
lighted
a
cigar
with
a
little
bow
to
his
daughter
of
course
you
don't
smoke
she
said
to
me
with
a
glimmer
of
malice
in
her
eyes
he
mustn't
interposed
the
professor
hastily
it
will
make
his
hand
tremble
no
it
doesn't
said
i
laughing
but
my
hand
will
shake
if
i
don't
smoke
are
you
going
to
employ
me
as
a
draughtsman
you'll
know
to-morrow
he
chuckled
with
a
mysterious
smile
at
his
daughter--daisy
give
him
my
best
cigars
put
the
box
here
on
the
table
we
can't
afford
to
have
his
hand
tremble
miss
holroyd
rose
and
crossed
the
hallway
to
her
father's
room
returning
presently
with
a
box
of
promising-looking
cigars
i
don't
think
he
knows
what
is
good
for
him
she
said
he
should
smoke
only
one
every
day
it
was
hard
to
bear
i
am
not
vindictive
but
i
decided
to
treasure
up
a
few
of
miss
holroyd's
gentle
taunts
my
intimacy
with
her
brother
was
certainly
a
disadvantage
to
me
now
jack
had
apparently
been
talking
too
much
and
his
sister
appeared
to
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
my
past
it
was
a
disadvantage
i
remembered
her
vaguely
as
a
girl
with
long
braids
who
used
to
come
on
sundays
with
her
father
and
take
tea
with
us
in
our
rooms
then
she
went
to
germany
to
school
and
jack
and
i
employed
our
sunday
evenings
otherwise
it
is
true
that
i
regarded
her
weekly
visits
as
a
species
of
infliction
but
i
did
not
think
i
ever
showed
it
it
is
strange
said
i
that
you
did
not
recognise
me
at
once
miss
holroyd
have
i
changed
so
greatly
in
five
years
you
wore
a
pointed
french
beard
in
paris
she
said--a
very
downy
one
and
you
never
stayed
to
tea
but
twice
and
then
you
only
spoke
once
oh
said
i
blankly
what
did
i
say
you
asked
me
if
i
liked
plums
said
daisy
bursting
into
an
irresistible
ripple
of
laughter
i
saw
that
i
must
have
made
the
same
sort
of
an
ass
of
myself
that
most
boys
of
eighteen
do
it
was
too
bad
i
never
thought
about
the
future
in
those
days
who
could
have
imagined
that
little
daisy
holroyd
would
have
grown
up
into
this
bewildering
young
lady
it
was
really
too
bad
presently
the
professor
retired
to
his
room
carrying
with
him
an
armful
of
drawings
and
bidding
us
not
to
sit
up
late
when
he
closed
his
door
miss
holroyd
turned
to
me
papa
will
work
over
those
drawings
until
midnight
she
said
with
a
despairing
smile
it
isn't
good
for
him
i
said
what
are
the
drawings
you
may
know
to-morrow
she
answered
leaning
forward
on
the
table
and
shading
her
face
with
one
hand
tell
me
about
yourself
and
jack
in
paris
i
looked
at
her
suspiciously
what
there
isn't
much
to
tell
we
studied
jack
went
to
the
law
school
and
i
attended--er--oh
all
sorts
of
schools
did
you
surely
you
gave
yourself
a
little
recreation
occasionally
occasionally
i
nodded
i
am
afraid
you
and
jack
studied
too
hard
that
may
be
said
i
looking
meek
especially
about
fossils
i
couldn't
stand
that
miss
holroyd
i
said
i
do
care
for
fossils
you
may
think
that
i
am
a
humbug
but
i
have
a
perfect
mania
for
fossils--now
since
when
about
an
hour
ago
i
said
airily
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
saw
that
she
had
flushed
up
it
pleased
me
you
will
soon
tire
of
the
experiment
she
said
with
a
dangerous
smile
oh
i
may
i
replied
indifferently
she
drew
back
the
movement
was
scarcely
perceptible
but
i
noticed
it
and
she
knew
i
did
the
atmosphere
was
vaguely
hostile
one
feels
such
mental
conditions
and
changes
instantly
i
picked
up
a
chessboard
opened
it
set
up
the
pieces
with
elaborate
care
and
began
to
move
first
the
white
then
the
black
miss
holroyd
watched
me
coldly
at
first
but
after
a
dozen
moves
she
became
interested
and
leaned
a
shade
nearer
i
moved
a
black
pawn
forward
why
do
you
do
that
said
daisy
because
said
i
the
white
queen
threatens
the
pawn
it
was
an
aggressive
move
she
insisted
purely
defensive
i
said
if
her
white
highness
will
let
the
pawn
alone
the
pawn
will
let
the
queen
alone
miss
holroyd
rested
her
chin
on
her
wrist
and
gazed
steadily
at
the
board
she
was
flushing
furiously
but
she
held
her
ground
if
the
white
queen
doesn't
block
that
pawn
the
pawn
may
become
dangerous
she
said
coldly
i
laughed
and
closed
up
the
board
with
a
snap
true
i
said
it
might
even
take
the
queen
after
a
moment's
silence
i
asked
what
would
you
do
in
that
case
miss
holroyd
i
should
resign
she
said
serenely
then
realizing
what
she
had
said
she
lost
her
self-possession
for
a
second
and
cried
no
indeed
i
should
fight
to
the
bitter
end
i
mean----
what
i
asked
lingering
over
my
revenge
i
mean
she
said
slowly
that
your
black
pawn
would
never
have
the
chance--never
i
should
take
it
immediately
i
believe
you
would
said
i
smiling
so
we'll
call
the
game
yours
and--the
pawn
captured
i
don't
want
it
she
exclaimed
a
pawn
is
worthless
except
when
it's
in
the
king
row
chess
is
most
interesting
she
observed
sedately
she
had
completely
recovered
her
self-control
still
i
saw
that
she
now
had
a
certain
respect
for
my
defensive
powers
it
was
very
soothing
to
me
you
know
said
i
gravely
that
i
am
fonder
of
jack
than
of
anybody
that's
the
reason
we
never
write
each
other
except
to
borrow
things
i
am
afraid
that
when
i
was
a
young
cub
in
france
i
was
not
an
attractive
personality
on
the
contrary
said
daisy
smiling
i
thought
you
were
very
big
and
very
perfect
i
had
illusions
i
wept
often
when
i
went
home
and
remembered
that
you
never
took
the
trouble
to
speak
to
me
but
once
i
was
a
cub
i
said
not
selfish
and
brutal
but
i
didn't
understand
schoolgirls
i
never
had
any
sisters
and
i
didn't
know
what
to
say
to
very
young
girls
if
i
had
imagined
that
you
felt
hurt----
oh
i
did--five
years
ago
afterward
i
laughed
at
the
whole
thing
laughed
i
repeated
vaguely
disappointed
why
of
course
i
was
very
easily
hurt
when
i
was
a
child
i
think
i
have
outgrown
it
the
soft
curve
of
her
sensitive
mouth
contradicted
her
will
you
forgive
me
now
i
asked
yes
i
had
forgotten
the
whole
thing
until
i
met
you
an
hour
or
so
ago
there
was
something
that
had
a
ring
not
entirely
genuine
in
this
speech
i
noticed
it
but
forgot
it
the
next
moment
tiger
cubs
have
stripes
said
i
selfishness
blossoms
in
the
cradle
and
prophecy
is
not
difficult
i
hope
i
am
not
more
selfish
than
my
brothers
i
hope
not
she
said
smiling
presently
she
rose
touched
her
hair
with
the
tip
of
one
finger
and
walked
to
the
door
good-night
she
said
courtesying
very
low
good-night
said
i
opening
the
door
for
her
to
pass
iii
the
sea
was
a
sheet
of
silver
tinged
with
pink
the
tremendous
arch
of
the
sky
was
all
shimmering
and
glimmering
with
the
promise
of
the
sun
already
the
mist
above
flecked
with
clustered
clouds
flushed
with
rose
colour
and
dull
gold
i
heard
the
low
splash
of
the
waves
breaking
and
curling
across
the
beach
a
wandering
breeze
fresh
and
fragrant
blew
the
curtains
of
my
window
there
was
the
scent
of
sweet
bay
in
the
room
and
everywhere
the
subtile
nameless
perfume
of
the
sea
when
at
last
i
stood
upon
the
shore
the
air
and
sea
were
all
aglimmer
in
a
rosy
light
deepening
to
crimson
in
the
zenith
along
the
beach
i
saw
a
little
cove
shelving
and
all
ashine
where
shallow
waves
washed
with
a
mellow
sound
fine
as
dusted
gold
the
shingle
glowed
and
the
thin
film
of
water
rose
receded
crept
up
again
a
little
higher
and
again
flowed
back
with
the
low
hiss
of
snowy
foam
and
gilded
bubbles
breaking
i
stood
a
little
while
quiet
my
eyes
upon
the
water
the
invitation
of
the
ocean
in
my
ears
vague
and
sweet
as
the
murmur
of
a
shell
then
i
looked
at
my
bathing
suit
and
towels
in
we
go
said
i
aloud
a
second
later
the
prophecy
was
fulfilled
i
swam
far
out
to
sea
and
as
i
swam
the
waters
all
around
me
turned
to
gold
the
sun
had
risen
there
is
a
fragrance
in
the
sea
at
dawn
that
none
can
name
whitethorn
abloom
in
may
sedges
asway
and
scented
rushes
rustling
in
an
inland
wind
recall
the
sea
to
me--i
can't
say
why
far
out
at
sea
i
raised
myself
swung
around
dived
and
set
out
again
for
shore
striking
strong
strokes
until
the
flecked
foam
flew
and
when
at
last
i
shot
through
the
breakers
i
laughed
aloud
and
sprang
upon
the
beach
breathless
and
happy
then
from
the
ocean
came
another
cry
clear
joyous
and
a
white
arm
rose
in
the
air
she
came
drifting
in
with
the
waves
like
a
white
sea-sprite
laughing
at
me
from
her
tangled
hair
and
i
plunged
into
the
breakers
again
to
join
her
side
by
side
we
swam
along
the
coast
just
outside
the
breakers
until
in
the
next
cove
we
saw
the
flutter
of
her
maid's
cap
strings
i
will
beat
you
to
breakfast
she
cried
as
i
rested
watching
her
glide
up
along
the
beach
done
said
i--for
a
sea-shell
done
she
called
across
the
water
i
made
good
speed
along
the
shore
and
i
was
not
long
in
dressing
but
when
i
entered
the
dining-room
she
was
there
demure
smiling
exquisite
in
her
cool
white
frock
the
sea-shell
is
yours
said
i
i
hope
i
can
find
one
with
a
pearl
in
it
the
professor
hurried
in
before
she
could
reply
he
greeted
me
very
cordially
but
there
was
an
abstracted
air
about
him
and
he
called
me
dick
until
i
recognised
that
remonstrance
was
useless
he
was
not
long
over
his
coffee
and
rolls
mcpeek
and
frisby
will
return
with
the
last
load
including
your
trunk
by
early
afternoon
he
said
rising
and
picking
up
his
bundle
of
drawings
i
haven't
time
to
explain
to
you
what
we
are
doing
dick
but
daisy
will
take
you
about
and
instruct
you
she
will
give
you
the
rifle
standing
in
my
room--it's
a
good
winchester
i
have
sent
for
an
'express'
for
you
big
enough
to
knock
over
any
elephant
in
india--daisy
take
him
through
the
sheds
and
tell
him
everything
luncheon
is
at
noon--do
you
usually
take
luncheon
dick
when
i
am
permitted
i
smiled
well
said
the
professor
doubtfully
you
mustn't
come
back
here
for
it
freda
can
take
you
what
you
want
is
your
hand
unsteady
after
eating
why
papa
said
daisy
do
you
intend
to
starve
him
we
all
laughed
the
professor
tucked
his
drawings
into
a
capacious
pocket
pulled
his
sea
boots
up
to
his
hips
seized
a
spade
and
left
nodding
to
us
as
though
he
were
thinking
of
something
else
we
went
to
the
door
and
watched
him
across
the
salt
meadows
until
a
distant
sand
dune
hid
him
come
said
daisy
holroyd
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
the
shop
she
put
on
a
broad-brimmed
straw
hat
a
distractingly
pretty
combination
of
filmy
cool
stuffs
and
led
the
way
to
the
long
low
structure
that
i
had
noticed
the
evening
before
the
interior
was
lighted
by
the
numberless
little
portholes
and
i
could
see
everything
plainly
i
acknowledge
i
was
nonplussed
by
what
i
did
see
in
the
centre
of
the
shed
which
must
have
been
at
least
a
hundred
feet
long
stood
what
i
thought
at
first
was
the
skeleton
of
an
enormous
whale
after
a
moment's
silent
contemplation
of
the
thing
i
saw
that
it
could
not
be
a
whale
for
the
frames
of
two
gigantic
bat-like
wings
rose
from
each
shoulder
also
i
noticed
that
the
animal
possessed
legs--four
of
them--with
most
unpleasant-looking
webbed
claws
fully
eight
feet
long
the
bony
framework
of
the
head
too
resembled
something
between
a
crocodile
and
a
monstrous
snapping
turtle
the
walls
of
the
shanty
were
hung
with
drawings
and
blue
prints
a
man
dressed
in
white
linen
was
tinkering
with
the
vertebrã¦
of
the
lizardlike
tail
where
on
earth
did
such
a
reptile
come
from
i
asked
at
length
oh
it's
not
real
said
daisy
scornfully
it's
papier-machã©
i
see
said
i--a
stage
prop
a
what
asked
daisy
in
hurt
astonishment
why
a--a
sort
of
siegfried
dragon--a
what's-his-name--er
pfafner
or
peffer
or----
if
my
father
heard
you
say
such
things
he
would
dislike
you
said
daisy
she
looked
grieved
and
moved
toward
the
door
i
apologized--for
what
i
knew
not--and
we
became
reconciled
she
ran
into
her
father's
room
and
brought
me
the
rifle
a
very
good
winchester
she
also
gave
me
a
cartridge
belt
full
now
she
smiled
i
shall
take
you
to
your
observatory
and
when
we
arrive
you
are
to
begin
your
duty
at
once
and
that
duty
i
ventured
shouldering
the
rifle
that
duty
is
to
watch
the
ocean
i
shall
then
explain
the
whole
affair--but
you
mustn't
look
at
me
while
i
speak
you
must
watch
the
sea
this
said
i
is
hardship
i
had
rather
go
without
the
luncheon
i
do
not
think
she
was
offended
at
my
speech
still
she
frowned
for
almost
three
seconds
we
passed
through
acres
of
sweet
bay
and
spear
grass
sometimes
skirting
thickets
of
twisted
cedars
sometimes
walking
in
the
full
glare
of
the
morning
sun
sinking
into
shifting
sand
where
sun-scorched
shells
crackled
under
our
feet
and
sun-browned
seaweed
glistened
bronzed
and
iridescent
then
as
we
climbed
a
little
hill
the
sea
wind
freshened
in
our
faces
and
lo
the
ocean
lay
below
us
far-stretching
as
the
eye
could
reach
glittering
magnificent
daisy
sat
down
flat
on
the
sand
it
takes
a
clever
girl
to
do
that
and
retain
the
respectful
deference
due
her
from
men
it
takes
a
graceful
girl
to
accomplish
it
triumphantly
when
a
man
is
looking
you
must
sit
beside
me
she
said--as
though
it
would
prove
irksome
to
me
now
she
continued
you
must
watch
the
water
while
i
am
talking
i
nodded
why
don't
you
do
it
then
she
asked
i
succeeded
in
wrenching
my
head
toward
the
ocean
although
i
felt
sure
it
would
swing
gradually
round
again
in
spite
of
me
to
begin
with
said
daisy
holroyd
there's
a
thing
in
that
ocean
that
would
astonish
you
if
you
saw
it
turn
your
head
i
am
i
said
meekly
did
you
hear
what
i
said
yes--er--a
thing
in
the
ocean
that's
going
to
astonish
me
visions
of
mermaids
rose
before
me
the
thing
said
daisy
is
a
thermosaurus
i
nodded
vaguely
as
though
anticipating
a
delightful
introduction
to
a
nautical
friend
you
don't
seem
astonished
she
said
reproachfully
why
should
i
be
i
asked
please
turn
your
eyes
toward
the
water
suppose
a
thermosaurus
should
look
out
of
the
waves
well
said
i
in
that
case
the
pleasure
would
be
mutual
she
frowned
and
bit
her
upper
lip
do
you
know
what
a
thermosaurus
is
she
asked
if
i
am
to
guess
said
i
i
guess
it's
a
jellyfish
it's
that
big
ugly
horrible
creature
that
i
showed
you
in
the
shed
cried
daisy
impatiently
eh
i
stammered
not
papier-machã©
either
she
continued
excitedly
it's
a
real
one
this
was
pleasant
news
i
glanced
instinctively
at
my
rifle
and
then
at
the
ocean
well
said
i
at
last
it
strikes
me
that
you
and
i
resemble
a
pair
of
andromedas
waiting
to
be
swallowed
this
rifle
won't
stop
a
beast
a
live
beast
like
that
nibelungen
dragon
of
yours
yes
it
will
she
said
it's
not
an
ordinary
rifle
then
for
the
first
time
i
noticed
just
below
the
magazine
a
cylindrical
attachment
that
was
strange
to
me
now
if
you
will
watch
the
sea
very
carefully
and
will
promise
not
to
look
at
me
said
daisy
i
will
try
to
explain
she
did
not
wait
for
me
to
promise
but
went
on
eagerly
a
sparkle
of
excitement
in
her
blue
eyes
you
know
of
all
the
fossil
remains
of
the
great
bat-like
and
lizard-like
creatures
that
inhabited
the
earth
ages
and
ages
ago
the
bones
of
the
gigantic
saurians
are
the
most
interesting
i
think
they
used
to
splash
about
the
water
and
fly
over
the
land
during
the
carboniferous
period
anyway
it
doesn't
matter
of
course
you
have
seen
pictures
of
reconstructed
creatures
such
as
the
ichthyosaurus
the
plesiosaurus
the
anthracosaurus
and
the
thermosaurus
i
nodded
trying
to
keep
my
eyes
from
hers
and
you
know
that
the
remains
of
the
thermosaurus
were
first
discovered
and
reconstructed
by
papa
yes
said
i
there
was
no
use
in
saying
no
i
am
glad
you
do
now
papa
has
proved
that
this
creature
lived
entirely
in
the
gulf
stream
emerging
for
occasional
flights
across
an
ocean
or
two
can
you
imagine
how
he
proved
it
no
said
i
resolutely
pointing
my
nose
at
the
ocean
he
proved
it
by
a
minute
examination
of
the
microscopical
shells
found
among
the
ribs
of
the
thermosaurus
these
shells
contained
little
creatures
that
live
only
in
the
warm
waters
of
the
gulf
stream
they
were
the
food
of
the
thermosaurus
it
was
rather
slender
rations
for
a
thing
like
that
wasn't
it
did
he
ever
swallow
bigger
food--er--men
oh
yes
tons
of
fossil
bones
from
prehistoric
men
are
also
found
in
the
interior
of
the
thermosaurus
then
said
i
you
at
least
had
better
go
back
to
captain
mcpeek's----
please
turn
around
don't
be
so
foolish
i
didn't
say
there
was
a
live
thermosaurus
in
the
water
did
i
isn't
there
why
no
my
relief
was
genuine
but
i
thought
of
the
rifle
and
looked
suspiciously
out
to
sea
what's
the
winchester
for
i
asked
listen
and
i
will
explain
papa
has
found
out--how
i
do
not
exactly
understand--that
there
is
in
the
waters
of
the
gulf
stream
the
body
of
a
thermosaurus
the
creature
must
have
been
alive
within
a
year
or
so
the
impenetrable
scale
armour
that
covers
its
body
has
as
far
as
papa
knows
prevented
its
disintegration
we
know
that
it
is
there
still
or
was
there
within
a
few
months
papa
has
reports
and
sworn
depositions
from
steamer
captains
and
seamen
from
a
dozen
different
vessels
all
corroborating
each
other
in
essential
details
these
stories
of
course
get
into
the
newspapers--sea-serpent
stories--but
papa
knows
that
they
confirm
his
theory
that
the
huge
body
of
this
reptile
is
swinging
along
somewhere
on
the
gulf
stream
she
opened
her
sunshade
and
held
it
over
her
i
noticed
that
she
deigned
to
give
me
the
benefit
of
about
one
eighth
of
it
your
duty
with
that
rifle
is
this
if
we
are
fortunate
enough
to
see
the
body
of
the
thermosaurus
come
floating
by
you
are
to
take
good
aim
and
fire--fire
rapidly
every
bullet
in
the
magazine
then
reload
and
fire
again
and
reload
and
fire
as
long
as
you
have
any
cartridges
left
a
self-feeding
maxim
is
what
i
should
have
i
said
with
gentle
sarcasm
well
and
suppose
i
make
a
sieve
of
this
big
lizard
do
you
see
these
rings
in
the
sand
she
asked
sure
enough
somebody
had
driven
heavy
piles
deep
into
the
sand
all
around
us
and
to
the
tops
of
these
piles
were
attached
steel
rings
half
buried
under
the
spear
grass
we
sat
almost
exactly
in
the
centre
of
a
circle
of
these
rings
the
reason
is
this
said
daisy
every
bullet
in
your
cartridges
is
steel-tipped
and
armour-piercing
to
the
base
of
each
bullet
is
attached
a
thin
wire
of
pallium
pallium
is
that
new
metal
a
thread
of
which
drawn
out
into
finest
wire
will
hold
a
ton
of
iron
suspended
every
bullet
is
fitted
with
minute
coils
of
miles
of
this
wire
when
the
bullet
leaves
the
rifle
it
spins
out
this
wire
as
a
shot
from
a
life-saver's
mortar
spins
out
and
carries
the
life
line
to
a
wrecked
ship
the
end
of
each
coil
of
wire
is
attached
to
that
cylinder
under
the
magazine
of
your
rifle
as
soon
as
the
shell
is
automatically
ejected
this
wire
flies
out
also
a
bit
of
scarlet
tape
is
fixed
to
the
end
so
that
it
will
be
easy
to
pick
up
there
is
also
a
snap
clasp
on
the
end
and
this
clasp
fits
those
rings
that
you
see
in
the
sand
now
when
you
begin
firing
it
is
my
duty
to
run
and
pick
up
the
wire
ends
and
attach
them
to
the
rings
then
you
see
we
have
the
body
of
the
thermosaurus
full
of
bullets
every
bullet
anchored
to
the
shore
by
tiny
wires
each
of
which
could
easily
hold
a
ton's
strain
i
looked
at
her
in
amazement
then
she
added
calmly
we
have
captured
the
thermosaurus
your
father
said
i
at
length
must
have
spent
years
of
labour
over
this
preparation
it
is
the
work
of
a
lifetime
she
said
simply
my
face
i
suppose
showed
my
misgivings
it
must
not
fail
she
added
but--but
we
are
nowhere
near
the
gulf
stream
i
ventured
her
face
brightened
and
she
frankly
held
the
sunshade
over
us
both
ah
you
don't
know
she
said
what
else
papa
has
discovered
would
you
believe
that
he
has
found
a
loop
in
the
gulf
stream--a
genuine
loop--that
swings
in
here
just
outside
of
the
breakers
below
it
is
true
everybody
on
long
island
knows
that
there
is
a
warm
current
off
the
coast
but
nobody
imagined
it
was
merely
a
sort
of
backwater
from
the
gulf
stream
that
formed
a
great
circular
mill-race
around
the
cone
of
a
subterranean
volcano
and
rejoined
the
gulf
stream
off
cape
albatross
but
it
is
that
is
why
papa
bought
a
yacht
three
years
ago
and
sailed
about
for
two
years
so
mysteriously
oh
i
did
want
to
go
with
him
so
much
this
said
i
is
most
astonishing
she
leaned
enthusiastically
toward
me
her
lovely
face
aglow
isn't
it
she
said
and
to
think
that
you
and
papa
and
i
are
the
only
people
in
the
whole
world
who
know
this
to
be
included
in
such
a
triology
was
very
delightful
papa
is
writing
the
whole
thing--i
mean
about
the
currents
he
also
has
in
preparation
sixteen
volumes
on
the
thermosaurus
he
said
this
morning
that
he
was
going
to
ask
you
to
write
the
story
first
for
some
scientific
magazine
he
is
certain
that
professor
bruce
stoddard
of
columbia
will
write
the
pamphlets
necessary
this
will
give
papa
time
to
attend
to
the
sixteen-volume
work
which
he
expects
to
finish
in
three
years
let
us
first
said
i
laughing
catch
our
thermosaurus
we
must
not
fail
she
said
wistfully
we
shall
not
fail
i
said
for
i
promise
to
sit
on
this
sand
hill
as
long
as
i
live--until
a
thermosaurus
appears--if
that
is
your
wish
miss
holroyd
our
eyes
met
for
an
instant
she
did
not
chide
me
either
for
not
looking
at
the
ocean
her
eyes
were
bluer
anyway
i
suppose
she
said
bending
her
head
and
absently
pouring
sand
between
her
fingers--i
suppose
you
think
me
a
blue-stocking
or
something
odious
not
exactly
i
said
there
was
an
emphasis
in
my
voice
that
made
her
colour
after
a
moment
she
laid
the
sunshade
down
still
open
may
i
hold
it
i
asked
she
nodded
almost
imperceptibly
the
ocean
had
turned
a
deep
marine
blue
verging
on
purple
that
heralded
a
scorching
afternoon
the
wind
died
away
the
odour
of
cedar
and
sweet
bay
hung
heavy
in
the
air
in
the
sand
at
our
feet
an
iridescent
flower
beetle
crawled
its
metallic
green
and
blue
wings
burning
like
a
spark
great
gnats
with
filmy
glittering
wings
danced
aimlessly
above
the
young
golden-rod
burnished
crickets
inquisitive
timid
ran
from
under
chips
of
driftwood
waved
their
antennã¦
at
us
and
ran
back
again
one
by
one
the
marbled
tiger
beetles
tumbled
at
our
feet
dazed
from
the
exertion
of
an
aã«rial
flight
then
scrambled
and
ran
a
little
way
or
darted
into
the
wire
grass
where
great
brilliant
spiders
eyed
them
askance
from
their
gossamer
hammocks
far
out
at
sea
the
white
gulls
floated
and
drifted
on
the
water
or
sailed
up
into
the
air
to
flap
lazily
for
a
moment
and
settle
back
among
the
waves
strings
of
black
surf
ducks
passed
their
strong
wings
tipping
the
surface
of
the
water
single
wandering
coots
whirled
from
the
breakers
into
lonely
flight
toward
the
horizon
we
lay
and
watched
the
little
ring-necks
running
along
the
water's
edge
now
backing
away
from
the
incoming
tide
now
boldly
wading
after
the
undertow
the
harmony
of
silence
the
deep
perfume
the
mystery
of
waiting
for
that
something
that
all
await--what
is
it
love
death
or
only
the
miracle
of
another
morrow--troubled
me
with
vague
restfulness
as
sunlight
casts
shadows
happiness
too
throws
a
shadow
and
the
shadow
is
sadness
and
so
the
morning
wore
away
until
freda
came
with
a
cool-looking
hamper
then
delicious
cold
fowl
and
lettuce
sandwiches
and
champagne
cup
set
our
tongues
wagging
as
only
very
young
tongues
can
wag
daisy
went
back
with
freda
after
luncheon
leaving
me
a
case
of
cigars
with
a
bantering
smile
i
dozed
half
awake
keeping
a
partly
closed
eye
on
the
ocean
where
a
faint
gray
streak
showed
plainly
amid
the
azure
water
all
around
that
was
the
gulf
stream
loop
about
four
o'clock
frisby
appeared
with
a
bamboo
shelter
tent
for
which
i
was
unaffectedly
grateful
after
he
had
erected
it
over
me
he
stopped
to
chat
a
bit
but
the
conversation
bored
me
for
he
could
talk
of
nothing
but
bill-posting
you
wouldn't
ruin
the
landscape
here
would
you
i
asked
ruin
it
repeated
frisby
nervously
it's
ruined
now
there
ain't
a
place
to
stick
a
bill
the
snipe
stick
bills--in
the
sand
i
said
flippantly
there
was
no
humour
about
frisby
do
they
he
asked
i
moved
with
a
certain
impatience
bills
said
frisby
give
spice
an'
variety
to
nature
they
break
the
monotony
of
the
everlastin'
green
and
what-you-may-call-its
i
glared
at
him
bills
he
continued
are
not
easy
to
stick
lemme
tell
you
sir
sign
paintin's
a
soft
snap
when
it
comes
to
bill-stickin'
now
i
guess
i've
stuck
more
bills
in
new
york
state
than
ennybody
have
you
i
said
angrily
yes
siree
i
always
pick
out
the
purtiest
spots--kinder
filled
chuck
full
of
woods
and
brooks
and
things
then
i
h'ist
my
paste-pot
onto
a
rock
and
i
slather
that
rock
with
gum
and
whoop
she
goes
whoop
what
goes
the
bill
i
paste
her
onto
the
rock
with
one
swipe
of
the
brush
for
the
edges
and
a
back-handed
swipe
for
the
finish--except
when
a
bill
is
folded
in
two
halves
and
what
do
you
do
then
i
asked
disgusted
swipe
twice
said
frisby
with
enthusiasm
and
you
don't
think
it
injures
the
landscape
injures
it
he
exclaimed
convinced
that
i
was
attempting
to
joke
i
looked
wearily
out
to
sea
he
also
looked
at
the
water
and
sighed
sentimentally
floatin'
buoys
with
bills
onto
'em
is
a
idea
of
mine
he
observed
that
damn
ocean
is
monotonous
ain't
it
i
don't
know
what
i
might
have
done
to
frisby--the
rifle
was
so
convenient--if
his
mean
yellow
dog
had
not
waddled
up
at
this
juncture
hi
davy
sic
'em
said
frisby
expectorating
upon
a
clamshell
and
hurling
it
seaward
the
cur
watched
the
flight
of
the
shell
apathetically
then
squatted
in
the
sand
and
looked
at
his
master
kinder
lost
his
spirit
said
frisby
ain't
he
i
once
stuck
a
bill
onto
davy
an'
it
come
off
an'
the
paste
sorter
sickened
him
he
was
hell
on
rats--once
after
a
moment
or
two
frisby
took
himself
off
whistling
cheerfully
to
davy
who
followed
him
when
he
was
ready
the
rifle
burned
in
my
fingers
it
was
nearly
six
o'clock
when
the
professor
appeared
spade
on
shoulder
boots
smeared
with
mud
well
he
said
nothing
to
report
dick
my
boy
nothing
professor
he
wiped
his
shining
face
with
his
handkerchief
and
stared
at
the
water
my
calculations
lead
me
to
believe
he
said
that
our
prize
may
be
due
any
day
now
this
theory
i
base
upon
the
result
of
the
report
from
the
last
sea
captain
i
saw
i
can
not
understand
why
some
of
these
captains
did
not
take
the
carcass
in
tow
they
all
say
that
they
tried
but
that
the
body
sank
before
they
could
come
within
half
a
mile
the
truth
is
probably
that
they
did
not
stir
a
foot
from
their
course
to
examine
the
thing
have
you
ever
cruised
about
for
it
i
ventured
for
two
years
he
said
grimly
it's
no
use
it's
accident
when
a
ship
falls
in
with
it
one
captain
reports
it
a
thousand
miles
from
where
the
last
skipper
spoke
it
and
always
in
the
gulf
stream
they
think
it
is
a
different
specimen
every
time
and
the
papers
are
teeming
with
sea-serpent
fol-de-rol
are
you
sure
i
asked
that
it
will
swing
in
to
the
coast
on
this
gulf
stream
loop
i
think
i
may
say
that
it
is
certain
to
do
so
i
experimented
with
a
dead
right
whale
you
may
have
heard
of
its
coming
ashore
here
last
summer
i
think
i
did
said
i
with
a
faint
smile
the
thing
had
poisoned
the
air
for
miles
around
but
i
continued
suppose
it
comes
in
the
night
he
laughed
there
i
am
lucky
every
night
this
month
and
every
day
too
the
current
of
the
loop
runs
inland
so
far
that
even
a
porpoise
would
strand
for
at
least
twelve
hours
longer
than
that
i
have
not
experimented
with
but
i
know
that
the
shore
trend
of
the
loop
runs
across
a
long
spur
of
the
submerged
volcanic
mountain
and
that
anything
heavier
than
a
porpoise
would
scrape
the
bottom
and
be
carried
so
slowly
that
at
least
twelve
hours
must
elapse
before
the
carcass
could
float
again
into
deep
water
there
are
chances
of
its
stranding
indefinitely
too
but
i
don't
care
to
take
those
chances
that
is
why
i
have
stationed
you
here
dick
my
boy
he
glanced
again
at
the
water
smiling
to
himself
there
is
another
question
i
want
to
ask
i
said
if
you
don't
mind
of
course
not
he
said
warmly
what
are
you
digging
for
why
simply
for
exercise
the
doctor
told
me
i
was
killing
myself
with
my
sedentary
habits
so
i
decided
to
dig
i
don't
know
a
better
exercise
do
you
i
suppose
not
i
murmured
rather
red
in
the
face
i
wondered
whether
he'd
mention
fossils
did
daisy
tell
you
why
we
are
making
our
papier-machã©
thermosaurus
he
asked
i
shook
my
head
we
constructed
that
from
measurements
i
took
from
the
fossil
remains
of
the
thermosaurus
in
the
metropolitan
museum
professor
bruce
stoddard
made
the
drawings
we
set
it
up
here
all
ready
to
receive
the
skin
of
the
carcass
that
i
am
expecting
we
had
started
toward
home
walking
slowly
across
the
darkening
dunes
shoulder
to
shoulder
the
sand
was
deep
and
walking
was
not
easy
i
wish
said
i
at
last
that
i
knew
why
miss
holroyd
asked
me
not
to
walk
on
the
beach
it's
much
less
fatiguing
that
said
the
professor
is
a
matter
that
i
intend
to
discuss
with
you
to-night
he
spoke
gravely
almost
sadly
i
felt
that
something
of
unparalleled
importance
was
soon
to
be
revealed
so
i
kept
very
quiet
watching
the
ocean
out
of
the
corners
of
my
eyes
iv
dinner
was
ended
daisy
holroyd
lighted
her
father's
pipe
for
him
and
insisted
on
my
smoking
as
much
as
i
pleased
then
she
sat
down
and
folded
her
hands
like
a
good
little
girl
waiting
for
her
father
to
make
the
revelation
which
i
felt
in
my
bones
must
be
something
out
of
the
ordinary
the
professor
smoked
for
a
while
gazing
meditatively
at
his
daughter
then
fixing
his
gray
eyes
on
me
he
said
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
kree--that
australian
bird
half
parrot
half
hawk
that
destroys
so
many
sheep
in
new
south
wales
i
nodded
the
kree
kills
a
sheep
by
alighting
on
its
back
and
tearing
away
the
flesh
with
its
hooked
beak
until
a
vital
part
is
reached
you
know
that
well
it
has
been
discovered
that
the
kree
had
prehistoric
prototypes
these
birds
were
enormous
creatures
who
preyed
upon
mammoths
and
mastodons
and
even
upon
the
great
saurians
it
has
been
conclusively
proved
that
a
few
saurians
have
been
killed
by
the
ancestors
of
the
kree
but
the
favourite
food
of
these
birds
was
undoubtedly
the
thermosaurus
it
is
believed
that
the
birds
attacked
the
eyes
of
the
thermosaurus
and
when
as
was
its
habit
the
mammoth
creature
turned
on
its
back
to
claw
them
they
fell
upon
the
thinner
scales
of
its
stomach
armour
and
finally
killed
it
this
of
course
is
a
theory
but
we
have
almost
absolute
proofs
of
its
correctness
now
these
two
birds
are
known
among
scientists
as
the
ekaf-bird
and
the
ool-yllik
the
names
are
australian
in
which
country
most
of
their
remains
have
been
unearthed
they
lived
during
the
carboniferous
period
now
it
is
not
generally
known
but
the
fact
is
that
in
1801
captain
ransom
of
the
british
exploring
vessel
gull
purchased
from
the
natives
of
tasmania
the
skin
of
an
ekaf-bird
that
could
not
have
been
killed
more
than
twenty-four
hours
previous
to
its
sale
i
saw
this
skin
in
the
british
museum
it
was
labelled
unknown
bird
probably
extinct
it
took
me
exactly
a
week
to
satisfy
myself
that
it
was
actually
the
skin
of
an
ekaf-bird
but
that
is
not
all
dick
my
boy
continued
the
professor
excitedly
in
1854
admiral
stuart
of
our
own
navy
saw
the
carcass
of
a
strange
gigantic
bird
floating
along
the
southern
coast
of
australia
sharks
were
after
it
and
before
a
boat
could
be
lowered
these
miserable
fish
got
it
but
the
good
old
admiral
secured
a
few
feathers
and
sent
them
to
the
smithsonian
i
saw
them
they
were
not
even
labelled
but
i
knew
that
they
were
feathers
from
the
ekaf-bird
or
its
near
relative
the
ool-yllik
i
had
grown
so
interested
that
i
had
leaned
far
across
the
table
daisy
too
bent
forward
it
was
only
when
the
professor
paused
for
a
moment
that
i
noticed
how
close
together
our
heads
were--daisy's
and
mine
i
don't
think
she
realized
it
she
did
not
move
now
comes
the
important
part
of
this
long
discourse
said
the
professor
smiling
at
our
eagerness
ever
since
the
carcass
of
our
derelict
thermosaurus
was
first
noticed
every
captain
who
has
seen
it
has
also
reported
the
presence
of
one
or
more
gigantic
birds
in
the
neighbourhood
these
birds
at
a
great
distance
appeared
to
be
hovering
over
the
carcass
but
on
the
approach
of
a
vessel
they
disappeared
even
in
midocean
they
were
observed
when
i
heard
about
it
i
was
puzzled
a
month
later
i
was
satisfied
that
neither
the
ekaf-bird
nor
the
ool-yllik
was
extinct
last
monday
i
knew
that
i
was
right
i
found
forty-eight
distinct
impressions
of
the
huge
seven-toed
claw
of
the
ekaf-bird
on
the
beach
here
at
pine
inlet
you
may
imagine
my
excitement
i
succeeded
in
digging
up
enough
wet
sand
around
one
of
these
impressions
to
preserve
its
form
i
managed
to
get
it
into
a
soap
box
and
now
it
is
there
in
my
shop
the
tide
rose
too
rapidly
for
me
to
save
the
other
footprints
i
shuddered
at
the
possibility
of
a
clumsy
misstep
on
my
part
obliterating
the
impression
of
an
ool-yllik
that
is
the
reason
that
my
daughter
warned
you
off
the
beach
he
said
mildly
hanging
would
have
been
too
good
for
the
vandal
who
destroyed
such
priceless
prizes
i
cried
out
in
self-reproach
daisy
holroyd
turned
a
flushed
face
to
mine
and
impulsively
laid
her
hand
on
my
sleeve
how
could
you
know
she
said
it's
all
right
now
said
her
father
emphasizing
each
word
with
a
gentle
tap
of
his
pipe-bowl
on
the
table
edge
don't
be
hard
on
yourself
dick
my
boy
you'll
do
yeoman's
service
yet
it
was
nearly
midnight
and
still
we
chatted
on
about
the
thermosaurus
the
ekaf-bird
and
the
ool-yllik
eagerly
discussing
the
probability
of
the
great
reptile's
carcass
being
in
the
vicinity
that
alone
seemed
to
explain
the
presence
of
these
prehistoric
birds
at
pine
inlet
do
they
ever
attack
human
beings
i
asked
the
professor
looked
startled
gracious
he
exclaimed
i
never
thought
of
that
and
daisy
running
about
out
of
doors
dear
me
it
takes
a
scientist
to
be
an
unnatural
parent
his
alarm
was
half
real
half
assumed
but
all
the
same
he
glanced
gravely
at
us
both
shaking
his
handsome
head
absorbed
in
thought
daisy
herself
looked
a
little
doubtful
as
for
me
my
sensations
were
distinctly
queer
it
is
true
said
the
professor
frowning
at
the
wall
that
human
remains
have
been
found
associated
with
the
bones
of
the
ekaf-bird--i
don't
know
how
intimately
it
is
a
matter
to
be
taken
into
most
serious
consideration
the
problem
can
be
solved
said
i
in
several
ways
one
is
to
keep
miss
holroyd
in
the
house----
i
shall
not
stay
in
cried
daisy
indignantly
we
all
laughed
and
her
father
assured
her
that
she
should
not
be
abused
even
if
i
did
stay
in
she
said
one
of
these
birds
might
alight
on
master
dick
she
looked
saucily
at
me
as
she
spoke
but
turned
crimson
when
her
father
observed
quietly
you
don't
seem
to
think
of
me
daisy
of
course
i
do
she
said
getting
up
and
putting
both
arms
around
her
father's
neck
but
dick--as--as
you
call
him--is
so
helpless
and
timid
my
blissful
smile
froze
on
my
lips
timid
i
repeated
she
came
back
to
the
table
making
me
a
mocking
reverence
do
you
think
i
am
to
be
laughed
at
with
impunity
she
said
what
are
your
other
plans
dick
my
boy
asked
the
professor--daisy
let
him
alone
you
little
tease
one
is
to
haul
a
lot
of
cast-iron
boilers
along
the
dunes
i
said
if
these
birds
come
when
the
carcass
floats
in
and
if
they
seem
disposed
to
trouble
us
we
could
crawl
into
the
boilers
and
be
safe
why
that
is
really
brilliant
cried
daisy
be
quiet
my
child
dick
the
plan
is
sound
and
sensible
and
perfectly
practical
mcpeek
and
frisby
shall
go
for
a
dozen
loads
of
boilers
to-morrow
it
will
spoil
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
said
daisy
with
a
taunting
nod
to
me
and
frisby
will
probably
attempt
to
cover
them
with
bill-posters
i
added
laughing
that
said
daisy
i
shall
prevent
even
at
the
cost
of
my
life
and
she
stood
up
looking
very
determined
children
children
protested
the
professor
go
to
bed--you
bother
me
then
i
turned
deliberately
to
miss
holroyd
good-night
daisy
i
said
good-night
dick
she
said
very
gently
v
the
week
passed
quickly
for
me
leaving
but
few
definite
impressions
as
i
look
back
to
it
now
i
can
see
the
long
stretch
of
beach
burning
in
the
fierce
sunlight
the
endless
meadows
with
the
glimmer
of
water
in
the
distance
the
dunes
the
twisted
cedars
the
leagues
of
scintillating
ocean
rocking
rocking
always
rocking
in
the
starlit
nights
the
curlew
came
in
from
the
sand-bars
by
twos
and
threes
i
could
hear
their
faint
call
as
i
lay
in
bed
thinking
all
day
long
the
little
ring-necks
whistled
from
the
shore
the
plover
answered
them
from
distant
lonely
inland
pools
the
great
white
gulls
drifted
like
feathers
upon
the
sea
one
morning
toward
the
end
of
the
week
i
strolling
along
the
dunes
came
upon
frisby
he
was
bill-posting
i
caught
him
red-handed
this
said
i
must
stop
do
you
understand
mr
frisby
he
stepped
back
from
his
work
laying
his
head
on
one
side
considering
first
me
then
the
bill
that
he
had
pasted
on
one
of
our
big
boilers
don't
like
the
colour
he
asked
it
goes
well
on
them
boilers
colour
no
i
don't
like
the
colour
either
can't
you
understand
that
there
are
some
people
in
the
world
who
object
to
seeing
patent-medicine
advertisements
scattered
over
a
landscape
hey
he
said
perplexed
will
you
kindly
remove
that
advertisement
i
persisted
too
late
said
frisby
it's
sot
i
was
too
disgusted
to
speak
but
my
disgust
turned
to
anger
when
i
perceived
that
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
our
boilers
lying
from
three
to
four
hundred
feet
apart
were
ablaze
with
yellow
and
red
posters
extolling
the
eureka
liver
pill
company
it
don't
cost
'em
nothin'
said
frisby
cheerfully
i
done
it
fur
the
fun
of
it
purty
ain't
it
they
are
professor
holroyd's
boilers
i
said
subduing
a
desire
to
beat
frisby
with
my
telescope
wait
until
miss
holroyd
sees
this
work
don't
she
like
yeller
and
red
he
demanded
anxiously
you'll
find
out
said
i
frisby
gaped
at
his
handiwork
and
then
at
his
yellow
dog
after
a
moment
he
mechanically
spat
on
a
clamshell
and
requested
davy
to
sic
it
can't
you
comprehend
that
you
have
ruined
our
pleasure
in
the
landscape
i
asked
more
mildly
i've
got
some
green
bills
said
frisby
i
kin
stick
'em
over
the
yeller
ones----
confound
it
said
i
it
isn't
the
colour
then
observed
frisby
you
don't
like
them
pills
i've
got
some
bills
of
the
'cropper
bicycle'
and
a
few
of
'bagley
the
gents'
tailor----'
frisby
said
i
use
them
all--paste
the
whole
collection
over
your
dog
and
yourself--then
walk
off
the
cliff
he
sullenly
unfolded
a
green
poster
swabbed
the
boiler
with
paste
laid
the
upper
section
of
the
bill
upon
it
and
plastered
the
whole
bill
down
with
a
thwack
of
his
brush
as
i
walked
away
i
heard
him
muttering
next
day
daisy
was
so
horrified
that
i
promised
to
give
frisby
an
ultimatum
i
found
him
with
freda
gazing
sentimentally
at
his
work
and
i
sent
him
back
to
the
shop
in
a
hurry
telling
freda
at
the
same
time
that
she
could
spend
her
leisure
in
providing
mr
frisby
with
sand
soap
and
a
scrubbing
brush
then
i
walked
on
to
my
post
of
observation
i
watched
until
sunset
daisy
came
with
her
father
to
hear
my
report
but
there
was
nothing
to
tell
and
we
three
walked
slowly
back
to
the
house
in
the
evenings
the
professor
worked
on
his
volumes
the
click
of
his
type-writer
sounding
faintly
behind
his
closed
door
daisy
and
i
played
chess
sometimes
sometimes
we
played
hearts
i
don't
remember
that
we
ever
finished
a
game
of
either--we
talked
too
much
our
discussions
covered
every
topic
of
interest
we
argued
upon
politics
we
skimmed
over
literature
and
music
we
settled
international
differences
we
spoke
vaguely
of
human
brotherhood
i
say
we
slighted
no
subject
of
interest--i
am
wrong
we
never
spoke
of
love
now
love
is
a
matter
of
interest
to
ten
people
out
of
ten
why
it
was
that
it
did
not
appear
to
interest
us
is
as
interesting
a
question
as
love
itself
we
were
young
alert
enthusiastic
inquiring
we
eagerly
absorbed
theories
concerning
any
curious
phenomena
in
nature
as
intellectual
cocktails
to
stimulate
discussion
and
yet
we
did
not
discuss
love
i
do
not
say
that
we
avoided
it
no
the
subject
was
too
completely
ignored
for
even
that
and
yet
we
found
it
very
difficult
to
pass
an
hour
separated
the
professor
noticed
this
and
laughed
at
us
we
were
not
even
embarrassed
sunday
passed
in
pious
contemplation
of
the
ocean
daisy
read
a
little
in
her
prayer-book
and
the
professor
threw
a
cloth
over
his
typewriter
and
strolled
up
and
down
the
sands
he
may
have
been
lost
in
devout
abstraction
he
may
have
been
looking
for
footprints
as
for
me
my
mind
was
very
serene
and
i
was
more
than
happy
daisy
read
to
me
a
little
for
my
soul's
sake
and
the
professor
came
up
and
said
something
cheerful
he
also
examined
the
magazine
of
my
winchester
that
night
too
daisy
took
her
guitar
to
the
sands
and
sang
one
or
two
armenian
hymns
unlike
us
the
armenians
do
not
take
their
pleasures
sadly
one
of
their
pleasures
is
evidently
religion
the
big
moon
came
up
over
the
dunes
and
stared
at
the
sea
until
the
surface
of
every
wave
trembled
with
radiance
a
sudden
stillness
fell
across
the
world
the
wind
died
out
the
foam
ran
noiselessly
across
the
beach
the
cricket's
rune
was
stilled
i
leaned
back
dropping
one
hand
upon
the
sand
it
touched
another
hand
soft
and
cool
after
a
while
the
other
hand
moved
slightly
and
i
found
that
my
own
had
closed
above
it
presently
one
finger
stirred
a
little--only
a
little--for
our
fingers
were
interlocked
on
the
shore
the
foam-froth
bubbled
and
winked
and
glimmered
in
the
moonlight
a
star
fell
from
the
zenith
showering
the
night
with
incandescent
dust
if
our
fingers
lay
interlaced
beside
us
her
eyes
were
calm
and
serene
as
always
wide
open
fixed
upon
the
depths
of
a
dark
sky
and
when
her
father
rose
and
spoke
to
us
she
did
not
withdraw
her
hand
is
it
late
she
asked
dreamily
it
is
midnight
little
daughter
i
stood
up
still
holding
her
hand
and
aided
her
to
rise
and
when
at
the
door
i
said
good-night
she
turned
and
looked
at
me
for
a
little
while
in
silence
then
passed
into
her
room
slowly
with
head
still
turned
toward
me
all
night
long
i
dreamed
of
her
and
when
the
east
whitened
i
sprang
up
the
thunder
of
the
ocean
in
my
ears
the
strong
sea
wind
blowing
into
the
open
window
she
is
asleep
i
thought
and
i
leaned
from
the
window
and
peered
out
into
the
east
the
sea
called
to
me
tossing
its
thousand
arms
the
soaring
gulls
dipping
rising
wheeling
above
the
sand-bar
screamed
and
clamoured
for
a
playmate
i
slipped
into
my
bathing
suit
dropped
from
the
window
upon
the
soft
sand
and
in
a
moment
had
plunged
head
foremost
into
the
surf
swimming
beneath
the
waves
toward
the
open
sea
under
the
tossing
ocean
the
voice
of
the
waters
was
in
my
ears--a
low
sweet
voice
intimate
mysterious
through
singing
foam
and
broad
green
glassy
depths
by
whispering
sandy
channels
atrail
with
seaweed
and
on
on
out
into
the
vague
cool
sea
i
sped
rising
to
the
top
sinking
gliding
then
at
last
i
flung
myself
out
of
water
hands
raised
and
the
clamour
of
the
gulls
filled
my
ears
as
i
lay
breathing
fast
drifting
on
the
sea
far
out
beyond
the
gulls
i
saw
a
flash
of
white
and
an
arm
was
lifted
signalling
me
daisy
i
called
a
clear
hail
came
across
the
water
distinct
on
the
sea
wind
and
at
the
same
instant
we
raised
our
hands
and
moved
toward
each
other
how
we
laughed
as
we
met
in
the
sea
the
white
dawn
came
up
out
of
the
depths
the
zenith
turned
to
rose
and
ashes
and
with
the
dawn
came
the
wind--a
great
sea
wind
fresh
aromatic
that
hurled
our
voices
back
into
our
throats
and
lifted
the
sheeted
spray
above
our
heads
every
wave
crowned
with
mist
caught
us
in
a
cool
embrace
cradled
us
and
slipped
away
only
to
leave
us
to
another
wave
higher
stronger
crested
with
opalescent
glory
breathing
incense
we
turned
together
up
the
coast
swimming
lightly
side
by
side
but
our
words
were
caught
up
by
the
winds
and
whirled
into
the
sky
we
looked
up
at
the
driving
clouds
we
looked
out
upon
the
pallid
waste
of
waters
but
it
was
into
each
other's
eyes
we
looked
wondering
wistful
questioning
the
reason
of
sky
and
sea
and
there
in
each
other's
eyes
we
read
the
mystery
and
we
knew
that
earth
and
sky
and
sea
were
created
for
us
alone
drifting
on
by
distant
sands
and
dunes
her
white
fingers
touching
mine
we
spoke
keying
our
tones
to
the
wind's
vast
harmony
and
we
spoke
of
love
gray
and
wide
as
the
limitless
span
of
the
sky
and
the
sea
the
winds
gathered
from
the
world's
ends
to
bear
us
on
but
they
were
not
familiar
winds
for
now
along
the
coast
the
breakers
curled
and
showed
a
million
fangs
and
the
ocean
stirred
to
its
depths
uneasy
ominous
and
the
menace
of
its
murmur
drew
us
closer
as
we
moved
where
the
dull
thunder
and
the
tossing
spray
warned
us
from
sunken
reefs
we
heard
the
harsh
challenges
of
gulls
where
the
pallid
surf
twisted
in
yellow
coils
of
spume
above
the
bar
the
singing
sands
murmured
of
treachery
and
secrets
of
lost
souls
agasp
in
the
throes
of
silent
undertows
but
there
was
a
little
stretch
of
beach
glimmering
through
the
mountains
of
water
and
toward
this
we
turned
side
by
side
around
us
the
water
grew
warmer
the
breath
of
the
following
waves
moistened
our
cheeks
the
water
itself
grew
gray
and
strange
about
us
we
have
come
too
far
i
said
but
she
only
answered
faster
faster
i
am
afraid
the
water
was
almost
hot
now
its
aromatic
odour
filled
our
lungs
the
gulf
loop
i
muttered
daisy
shall
i
help
you
no
swim--close
by
me
oh-h
dick----
her
startled
cry
was
echoed
by
another--a
shrill
scream
unutterably
horrible--and
a
great
bird
flapped
from
the
beach
splashing
and
beating
its
pinions
across
the
water
with
a
thundering
noise
out
across
the
waves
it
blundered
rising
little
by
little
from
the
water
and
now
to
my
horror
i
saw
another
monstrous
bird
swinging
in
the
air
above
it
squealing
as
it
turned
on
its
vast
wings
before
i
could
speak
we
touched
the
beach
and
i
half
lifted
her
to
the
shore
quick
i
repeated
we
must
not
wait
her
eyes
were
dark
with
fear
but
she
rested
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
we
crept
up
among
the
dune
grasses
and
sank
down
by
the
point
of
sand
where
the
rough
shelter
stood
surrounded
by
the
iron-ringed
piles
she
lay
there
breathing
fast
and
deep
dripping
with
spray
i
had
no
power
of
speech
left
but
when
i
rose
wearily
to
my
knees
and
looked
out
upon
the
water
my
blood
ran
cold
above
the
ocean
on
the
breast
of
the
roaring
wind
three
enormous
birds
sailed
turning
and
wheeling
among
each
other
and
below
drifting
with
the
gray
stream
of
the
gulf
loop
a
colossal
bulk
lay
half
submerged--a
gigantic
lizard
floating
belly
upward
then
daisy
crept
kneeling
to
my
side
and
touched
me
trembling
from
head
to
foot
i
know
i
muttered
i
must
run
back
for
the
rifle
and--and
leave
me
i
took
her
by
the
hand
and
we
dragged
ourselves
through
the
wire
grass
to
the
open
end
of
a
boiler
lying
in
the
sand
she
crept
in
on
her
hands
and
knees
and
called
to
me
to
follow
you
are
safe
now
i
cried
i
must
go
back
for
the
rifle
the
birds
may--may
attack
you
if
they
do
i
can
get
into
one
of
the
other
boilers
i
said
daisy
you
must
not
venture
out
until
i
come
back
you
won't
will
you
no-o
she
whispered
doubtfully
then--good-by
good-by
she
answered
but
her
voice
was
very
small
and
still
good-by
i
said
again
i
was
kneeling
at
the
mouth
of
the
big
iron
tunnel
it
was
dark
inside
and
i
could
not
see
her
but
before
i
was
conscious
of
it
her
arms
were
around
my
neck
and
we
had
kissed
each
other
i
don't
remember
how
i
went
away
when
i
came
to
my
proper
senses
i
was
swimming
along
the
coast
at
full
speed
and
over
my
head
wheeled
one
of
the
birds
screaming
at
every
turn
the
intoxication
of
that
innocent
embrace
the
close
impress
of
her
arms
around
my
neck
gave
me
a
strength
and
recklessness
that
neither
fear
nor
fatigue
could
subdue
the
bird
above
me
did
not
even
frighten
me
i
watched
it
over
my
shoulder
swimming
strongly
with
the
tide
now
aiding
me
now
stemming
my
course
but
i
saw
the
shore
passing
quickly
and
my
strength
increased
and
i
shouted
when
i
came
in
sight
of
the
house
and
scrambled
up
on
the
sand
dripping
and
excited
there
was
nobody
in
sight
and
i
gave
a
last
glance
up
into
the
air
where
the
bird
wheeled
still
screeching
and
hastened
into
the
house
freda
stared
at
me
in
amazement
as
i
seized
the
rifle
and
shouted
for
the
professor
he
has
just
gone
to
town
with
captain
mcpeek
in
his
wagon
stammered
freda
what
i
cried
does
he
know
where
his
daughter
is
miss
holroyd
is
asleep--not
gasped
freda
where's
frisby
i
cried
impatiently
yimmie
quavered
freda
yes
jimmie
isn't
there
anybody
here
good
heavens
where's
that
man
in
the
shop
he
also
iss
gone
said
freda
shedding
tears
to
buy
papier-machã©
yimmie
he
iss
gone
to
post
bills
i
waited
to
hear
no
more
but
swung
my
rifle
over
my
shoulder
and
hanging
the
cartridge
belt
across
my
chest
hurried
out
and
up
the
beach
the
bird
was
not
in
sight
i
had
been
running
for
perhaps
a
minute
when
far
up
on
the
dunes
i
saw
a
yellow
dog
rush
madly
through
a
clump
of
sweet
bay
and
at
the
same
moment
a
bird
soared
past
rose
and
hung
hovering
just
above
the
thicket
suddenly
the
bird
swooped
there
was
a
shriek
and
a
yelp
from
the
cur
but
the
bird
gripped
it
in
one
claw
and
beat
its
wings
upon
the
sand
striving
to
rise
then
i
saw
frisby--paste
bucket
and
brush
raised--fall
upon
the
bird
yelling
lustily
the
fierce
creature
relaxed
its
talons
and
the
dog
rushed
on
squeaking
with
terror
the
bird
turned
on
frisby
and
sent
him
sprawling
on
his
face
a
sticky
mass
of
paste
and
sand
but
this
did
not
end
the
struggle
the
bird
croaking
wildly
flew
at
the
prostrate
billposter
and
the
sand
whirled
into
a
pillar
above
its
terrible
wings
scarcely
knowing
what
i
was
about
i
raised
my
rifle
and
fired
twice
a
horrid
scream
echoed
each
shot
and
the
bird
rose
heavily
in
a
shower
of
sand
but
two
bullets
were
embedded
in
that
mass
of
foul
feathers
and
i
saw
the
wires
and
scarlet
tape
uncoiling
on
the
sand
at
my
feet
in
an
instant
i
seized
them
and
passed
the
ends
around
a
cedar
tree
hooking
the
clasps
tight
then
i
cast
one
swift
glance
upward
where
the
bird
wheeled
screeching
anchored
like
a
kite
to
the
pallium
wires
and
i
hurried
on
across
the
dunes
the
shells
cutting
my
feet
and
the
bushes
tearing
my
wet
swimming
suit
until
i
dripped
with
blood
from
shoulder
to
ankle
out
in
the
ocean
the
carcass
of
the
thermosaurus
floated
claws
outspread
belly
glistening
in
the
gray
light
and
over
him
circled
two
birds
as
i
reached
the
shelter
i
knelt
and
fired
into
the
mass
of
scales
and
at
my
first
shot
a
horrible
thing
occurred
the
lizardlike
head
writhed
the
slitted
yellow
eyes
sliding
open
from
the
film
that
covered
them
a
shudder
passed
across
the
undulating
body
the
great
scaled
belly
heaved
and
one
leg
feebly
clawed
at
the
air
the
thing
was
still
alive
crushing
back
the
horror
that
almost
paralyzed
my
hands
i
planted
shot
after
shot
into
the
quivering
reptile
while
it
writhed
and
clawed
striving
to
turn
over
and
dive
and
at
each
shot
the
black
blood
spurted
in
long
slim
jets
across
the
water
and
now
daisy
was
at
my
side
pale
and
determined
swiftly
clasping
each
tape-marked
wire
to
the
iron
rings
in
the
circle
around
us
twice
i
filled
the
magazine
from
my
belt
and
twice
i
poured
streams
of
steel-tipped
bullets
into
the
scaled
mass
twisting
and
shuddering
on
the
sea
suddenly
the
birds
steered
toward
us
i
felt
the
wind
from
their
vast
wings
i
saw
the
feathers
erect
vibrating
i
saw
the
spread
claws
outstretched
and
i
struck
furiously
at
them
crying
to
daisy
to
run
into
the
iron
shelter
backing
swinging
my
clubbed
rifle
i
retreated
but
i
tripped
across
one
of
the
taut
pallium
wires
and
in
an
instant
the
hideous
birds
were
on
me
and
the
bone
in
my
forearm
snapped
like
a
pipestem
at
a
blow
from
their
wings
twice
i
struggled
to
my
knees
blinded
with
blood
confused
almost
fainting
then
i
fell
again
rolling
into
the
mouth
of
the
iron
boiler





when
i
struggled
back
to
consciousness
daisy
knelt
silently
beside
me
while
captain
mcpeek
and
professor
holroyd
bound
up
my
shattered
arm
talking
excitedly
the
pain
made
me
faint
and
dizzy
i
tried
to
speak
and
could
not
at
last
they
got
me
to
my
feet
and
into
the
wagon
and
daisy
came
too
and
crouched
beside
me
wrapped
in
oilskins
to
her
eyes
fatigue
lack
of
food
and
excitement
had
combined
with
wounds
and
broken
bones
to
extinguish
the
last
atom
of
strength
in
my
body
but
my
mind
was
clear
enough
to
understand
that
the
trouble
was
over
and
the
thermosaurus
safe
i
heard
mcpeek
say
that
one
of
the
birds
that
i
had
anchored
to
a
cedar
tree
had
torn
loose
from
the
bullets
and
winged
its
way
heavily
out
to
sea
the
professor
answered
yes
the
ekaf-bird
the
others
were
ool-ylliks
i'd
have
given
my
right
arm
to
have
secured
them
then
for
a
time
i
heard
no
more
but
the
jolting
of
the
wagon
over
the
dunes
roused
me
to
keenest
pain
and
i
held
out
my
right
hand
to
daisy
she
clasped
it
in
both
of
hers
and
kissed
it
again
and
again





there
is
little
more
to
add
i
think
professor
bruce
stoddard
has
edited
this
story
carefully
his
own
scientific
pamphlet
will
be
published
soon
to
be
followed
by
professor
holroyd's
sixteen
volumes
in
a
few
days
the
stuffed
and
mounted
thermosaurus
will
be
placed
on
free
public
exhibition
in
the
arena
of
madison
square
garden
the
only
building
in
the
city
large
enough
to
contain
the
body
of
this
immense
winged
reptile
when
my
arm
came
out
of
splints
daisy
and
i----
but
really
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
detailed
scientific
description
of
the
thermosaurus
which
i
think
i
shall
add
as
an
appendix
to
the
book
if
you
do
not
find
it
there
it
will
be
because
daisy
and
i
have
very
little
time
to
write
about
thermosaurians
but
what
i
really
want
to
tell
you
about
is
the
extraordinary
adventures
of
captain
mcpeek
and
frisby--how
they
produced
a
specimen
of
samia
cynthia
that
dwarfed
a
hundred
of
attacus
atlas
and
how
the
american
line
steamer
st
louis
fouled
the
thing
with
her
screw
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
determined
i
am
to
tell
it
to
you
it
will
be
difficult
to
prevent
me
and
that
is
not
fiction
either
envoi
envoi
i
when
shadows
pass
across
the
grass
and
april
breezes
stir
the
sedge
along
the
brimming
river's
edge
i
trail
my
line
for
silver
trout
and
smoke
and
dream
of
you
my
lass
and
wonder
why
we
two
fell
out
and
how
the
deuce
it
came
about
ii
when
swallows
sheer
the
meadow-mere
and
thickets
thrill
with
thrushes'
hymns
along
the
mill-pond's
reedy
rims
i
trail
my
line
for
shining
dace
but
how
can
finny
fishes
cheer
a
fellow
if
he
find
no
grace
in
your
sweet
eyes
and
your
dear
face
iii
let
thrushes
wing
their
way
and
sing
where
cresses
freshen
pebbled
nooks
by
silent
rills
and
singing
brooks
i
pass
my
way
alone
alas
with
your
dear
name
the
woodlands
ring--
your
name
is
murmured
by
the
grass
by
earth
by
air
all-where
i
pass

painted

i'll
cast
no
line
to-day

thrushes'
minstrelsy
vain

you
forgive
if
i
forgive
life
is
too
sad

think
to
live
alone

i'll
say
forgive
first--if
you
wish

earth

rhapsody

smile

if

cool
our

tries
his
voice

little
so

may
know
his
notes
more
perfectly
when
crickets
start
the
symphony

through

sun-soaked
grasses
ring
with
crickets
strumming
string
on
string
xiii
then
with
your
white
hand
daintily
scarce
touching
mine
we'll
leave
our
tree
and
ramble
slowly
toward
the
west
where
our
high
castle's
flaming
crest
towering
behind
the
setting
sun
flings
out
its
banners
one

xiv
deep
in

find
how
blind
we

how
blind
how
blind

how
he'll
laugh
who
holds
the
key
to
the
great
portal's
mystery

how
his
joyous
laugh
will
ring
when
you

bid
him
fling
the

ajar

you

me
xv

dark
december
strips
the
hedge
along
the
icy
river's
edge
yet
if
you
will
forgive
me
lass
the
world
shall
bloom
like
spring

me
snow
turn
to
dew

you
pass
xvi
swallows

sheer
the
frozen
mere
dead
reeds
along
the
mill-pond's
rims
shall
thrill
with
summer-thrushes'
hymns
while
summer
breezes
blow
apace
if
you
will

forgive
me
