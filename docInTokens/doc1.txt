toward
the
end
of
the
year
1920
the
government
of
the
united
states
had
practically
completed
the
programme
adopted
during
the
last
months
of
president
winthrop's
administration
the
country
was
apparently
tranquil
everybody
knows
how
the
tariff
and
labour
questions
were
settled
the
war
with
germany
incident
on
that
country's
seizure
of
the
samoan
islands
had
left
no
visible
scars
upon
the
republic
and
the
temporary
occupation
of
norfolk
by
the
invading
army
had
been
forgotten
in
the
joy
over
repeated
naval
victories
and
the
subsequent
ridiculous
plight
of
general
von
gartenlaube's
forces
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
the
cuban
and
hawaiian
investments
had
paid
one
hundred
per
cent
and
the
territory
of
samoa
was
well
worth
its
cost
as
a
coaling
station
the
country
was
in
a
superb
state
of
defence
every
coast
city
had
been
well
supplied
with
land
fortifications
the
army
under
the
parental
eye
of
the
general
staff
organized
according
to
the
prussian
system
had
been
increased
to
300000
men
with
a
territorial
reserve
of
a
million
and
six
magnificent
squadrons
of
cruisers
and
battle-ships
patrolled
the
six
stations
of
the
navigable
seas
leaving
a
steam
reserve
amply
fitted
to
control
home
waters
the
gentlemen
from
the
west
had
at
last
been
constrained
to
acknowledge
that
a
college
for
the
training
of
diplomats
was
as
necessary
as
law
schools
are
for
the
training
of
barristers
consequently
we
were
no
longer
represented
abroad
by
incompetent
patriots
the
nation
was
prosperous
chicago
for
a
moment
paralyzed
after
a
second
great
fire
had
risen
from
its
ruins
white
and
imperial
and
more
beautiful
than
the
white
city
which
had
been
built
for
its
plaything
in
1893
everywhere
good
architecture
was
replacing
bad
and
even
in
new
york
a
sudden
craving
for
decency
had
swept
away
a
great
portion
of
the
existing
horrors
streets
had
been
widened
properly
paved
and
lighted
trees
had
been
planted
squares
laid
out
elevated
structures
demolished
and
underground
roads
built
to
replace
them
the
new
government
buildings
and
barracks
were
fine
bits
of
architecture
and
the
long
system
of
stone
quays
which
completely
surrounded
the
island
had
been
turned
into
parks
which
proved
a
god-send
to
the
population
the
subsidizing
of
the
state
theatre
and
state
opera
brought
its
own
reward
the
united
states
national
academy
of
design
was
much
like
european
institutions
of
the
same
kind
nobody
envied
the
secretary
of
fine
arts
either
his
cabinet
position
or
his
portfolio
the
secretary
of
forestry
and
game
preservation
had
a
much
easier
time
thanks
to
the
new
system
of
national
mounted
police
we
had
profited
well
by
the
latest
treaties
with
france
and
england
the
exclusion
of
foreign-born
jews
as
a
measure
of
self-preservation
the
settlement
of
the
new
independent
negro
state
of
suanee
the
checking
of
immigration
the
new
laws
concerning
naturalization
and
the
gradual
centralization
of
power
in
the
executive
all
contributed
to
national
calm
and
prosperity
when
the
government
solved
the
indian
problem
and
squadrons
of
indian
cavalry
scouts
in
native
costume
were
substituted
for
the
pitiable
organizations
tacked
on
to
the
tail
of
skeletonized
regiments
by
a
former
secretary
of
war
the
nation
drew
a
long
sigh
of
relief
when
after
the
colossal
congress
of
religions
bigotry
and
intolerance
were
laid
in
their
graves
and
kindness
and
charity
began
to
draw
warring
sects
together
many
thought
the
millennium
had
arrived
at
least
in
the
new
world
which
after
all
is
a
world
by
itself
but
self-preservation
is
the
first
law
and
the
united
states
had
to
look
on
in
helpless
sorrow
as
germany
italy
spain
and
belgium
writhed
in
the
throes
of
anarchy
while
russia
watching
from
the
caucasus
stooped
and
bound
them
one
by
one
in
the
city
of
new
york
the
summer
of
1899
was
signalized
by
the
dismantling
of
the
elevated
railroads
the
summer
of
1900
will
live
in
the
memories
of
new
york
people
for
many
a
cycle
the
dodge
statue
was
removed
in
that
year
in
the
following
winter
began
that
agitation
for
the
repeal
of
the
laws
prohibiting
suicide
which
bore
its
final
fruit
in
the
month
of
april
1920
when
the
first
government
lethal
chamber
was
opened
on
washington
square
i
had
walked
down
that
day
from
dr
archer's
house
on
madison
avenue
where
i
had
been
as
a
mere
formality
ever
since
that
fall
from
my
horse
four
years
before
i
had
been
troubled
at
times
with
pains
in
the
back
of
my
head
and
neck
but
now
for
months
they
had
been
absent
and
the
doctor
sent
me
away
that
day
saying
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
cured
in
me
it
was
hardly
worth
his
fee
to
be
told
that
i
knew
it
myself
still
i
did
not
grudge
him
the
money
what
i
minded
was
the
mistake
which
he
made
at
first
when
they
picked
me
up
from
the
pavement
where
i
lay
unconscious
and
somebody
had
mercifully
sent
a
bullet
through
my
horse's
head
i
was
carried
to
dr
archer
and
he
pronouncing
my
brain
affected
placed
me
in
his
private
asylum
where
i
was
obliged
to
endure
treatment
for
insanity
at
last
he
decided
that
i
was
well
and
i
knowing
that
my
mind
had
always
been
as
sound
as
his
if
not
sounder
paid
my
tuition
as
he
jokingly
called
it
and
left
i
told
him
smiling
that
i
would
get
even
with
him
for
his
mistake
and
he
laughed
heartily
and
asked
me
to
call
once
in
a
while
i
did
so
hoping
for
a
chance
to
even
up
accounts
but
he
gave
me
none
and
i
told
him
i
would
wait
the
fall
from
my
horse
had
fortunately
left
no
evil
results
on
the
contrary
it
had
changed
my
whole
character
for
the
better
from
a
lazy
young
man
about
town
i
had
become
active
energetic
temperate
and
above
all--oh
above
all
else--ambitious
there
was
only
one
thing
which
troubled
me
i
laughed
at
my
own
uneasiness
and
yet
it
troubled
me
during
my
convalescence
i
had
bought
and
read
for
the
first
time
the
king
in
yellow
i
remember
after
finishing
the
first
act
that
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
better
stop
i
started
up
and
flung
the
book
into
the
fireplace
the
volume
struck
the
barred
grate
and
fell
open
on
the
hearth
in
the
firelight
if
i
had
not
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
opening
words
in
the
second
act
i
should
never
have
finished
it
but
as
i
stooped
to
pick
it
up
my
eyes
became
riveted
to
the
open
page
and
with
a
cry
of
terror
or
perhaps
it
was
of
joy
so
poignant
that
i
suffered
in
every
nerve
i
snatched
the
thing
out
of
the
coals
and
crept
shaking
to
my
bedroom
where
i
read
it
and
reread
it
and
wept
and
laughed
and
trembled
with
a
horror
which
at
times
assails
me
yet
this
is
the
thing
that
troubles
me
for
i
cannot
forget
carcosa
where
black
stars
hang
in
the
heavens
where
the
shadows
of
men's
thoughts
lengthen
in
the
afternoon
when
the
twin
suns
sink
into
the
lake
of
hali
and
my
mind
will
bear
for
ever
the
memory
of
the
pallid
mask
i
pray
god
will
curse
the
writer
as
the
writer
has
cursed
the
world
with
this
beautiful
stupendous
creation
terrible
in
its
simplicity
irresistible
in
its
truth--a
world
which
now
trembles
before
the
king
in
yellow
when
the
french
government
seized
the
translated
copies
which
had
just
arrived
in
paris
london
of
course
became
eager
to
read
it
it
is
well
known
how
the
book
spread
like
an
infectious
disease
from
city
to
city
from
continent
to
continent
barred
out
here
confiscated
there
denounced
by
press
and
pulpit
censured
even
by
the
most
advanced
of
literary
anarchists
no
definite
principles
had
been
violated
in
those
wicked
pages
no
doctrine
promulgated
no
convictions
outraged
it
could
not
be
judged
by
any
known
standard
yet
although
it
was
acknowledged
that
the
supreme
note
of
art
had
been
struck
in
the
king
in
yellow
all
felt
that
human
nature
could
not
bear
the
strain
nor
thrive
on
words
in
which
the
essence
of
purest
poison
lurked
the
very
banality
and
innocence
of
the
first
act
only
allowed
the
blow
to
fall
afterward
with
more
awful
effect
it
was
i
remember
the
13th
day
of
april
1920
that
the
first
government
lethal
chamber
was
established
on
the
south
side
of
washington
square
between
wooster
street
and
south
fifth
avenue
the
block
which
had
formerly
consisted
of
a
lot
of
shabby
old
buildings
used
as
cafã©s
and
restaurants
for
foreigners
had
been
acquired
by
the
government
in
the
winter
of
1898
the
french
and
italian
cafã©s
and
restaurants
were
torn
down
the
whole
block
was
enclosed
by
a
gilded
iron
railing
and
converted
into
a
lovely
garden
with
lawns
flowers
and
fountains
in
the
centre
of
the
garden
stood
a
small
white
building
severely
classical
in
architecture
and
surrounded
by
thickets
of
flowers
six
ionic
columns
supported
the
roof
and
the
single
door
was
of
bronze
a
splendid
marble
group
of
the
fates
stood
before
the
door
the
work
of
a
young
american
sculptor
boris
yvain
who
had
died
in
paris
when
only
twenty-three
years
old
the
inauguration
ceremonies
were
in
progress
as
i
crossed
university
place
and
entered
the
square
i
threaded
my
way
through
the
silent
throng
of
spectators
but
was
stopped
at
fourth
street
by
a
cordon
of
police
a
regiment
of
united
states
lancers
were
drawn
up
in
a
hollow
square
round
the
lethal
chamber
on
a
raised
tribune
facing
washington
park
stood
the
governor
of
new
york
and
behind
him
were
grouped
the
mayor
of
new
york
and
brooklyn
the
inspector-general
of
police
the
commandant
of
the
state
troops
colonel
livingston
military
aid
to
the
president
of
the
united

blount
commanding

of

surgeon-general

the
staff
of
the
national
free
hospital
senators
wyse
and
franklin
of
new
york
and
the
commissioner
of
public
works
the
tribune
was
surrounded
by
a
squadron
of
hussars
of
the
national
guard
the
governor
was
finishing
his
reply
to
the
short
speech
of
the
surgeon-general
i
heard
him
say
the
laws
prohibiting
suicide
and
providing
punishment
for
any
attempt
at
self-destruction
have
been
repealed
the
government
has
seen
fit
to
acknowledge
the
right
of
man
to
end
an
existence
which
may
have
become
intolerable
to
him
through
physical
suffering
or
mental
despair
it
is
believed
that
the
community
will
be
benefited
by
the
removal
of
such
people
from
their
midst
since
the
passage
of
this
law
the
number
of
suicides
in
the
united
states
has
not
increased
now
the
government
has
determined
to
establish
a
lethal
chamber
in
every
city
town
and
village
in
the
country
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
or
not
that
class
of
human
creatures
from
whose
desponding
ranks
new
victims
of
self-destruction
fall
daily
will
accept
the
relief
thus
provided
he
paused
and
turned
to
the
white
lethal
chamber
the
silence
in
the
street
was
absolute
there
a
painless
death
awaits
him
who
can
no
longer
bear
the
sorrows
of
this
life
if
death
is
welcome
let
him
seek
it
there
then
quickly
turning
to
the
military
aid
of
the
president's
household
he
said
i
declare
the
lethal
chamber
open
and
again
facing
the
vast
crowd
he
cried
in
a
clear
voice
citizens
of
new
york
and
of
the
united
states
of
america
through
me
the
government
declares
the
lethal
chamber
to
be
open
the
solemn
hush
was
broken
by
a
sharp
cry
of
command
the
squadron
of
hussars
filed
after
the
governor's
carriage
the
lancers
wheeled
and
formed
along
fifth
avenue
to
wait
for
the
commandant
of
the
garrison
and
the
mounted
police
followed
them
i
left
the
crowd
to
gape
and
stare
at
the
white
marble
death
chamber
and
crossing
south
fifth
avenue
walked
along
the
western
side
of
that
thoroughfare
to
bleecker
street
then
i
turned
to
the
right
and
stopped
before
a
dingy
shop
which
bore
the
sign
hawberk
armourer
i
glanced
in
at
the
doorway
and
saw
hawberk
busy
in
his
little
shop
at
the
end
of
the
hall
he
looked
up
and
catching
sight
of
me
cried
in
his
deep
hearty
voice
come
in
mr
castaigne
constance
his
daughter
rose
to
meet
me
as
i
crossed
the
threshold
and
held
out
her
pretty
hand
but
i
saw
the
blush
of
disappointment
on
her
cheeks
and
knew
that
it
was
another
castaigne
she
had
expected
my
cousin
louis
i
smiled
at
her
confusion
and
complimented
her
on
the
banner
she
was
embroidering
from
a
coloured
plate
old
hawberk
sat
riveting
the
worn
greaves
of
some
ancient
suit
of
armour
and
the
ting
ting
ting
of
his
little
hammer
sounded
pleasantly
in
the
quaint
shop
presently
he
dropped
his
hammer
and
fussed
about
for
a
moment
with
a
tiny
wrench
the
soft
clash
of
the
mail
sent
a
thrill
of
pleasure
through
me
i
loved
to
hear
the
music
of
steel
brushing
against
steel
the
mellow
shock
of
the
mallet
on
thigh
pieces
and
the
jingle
of
chain
armour
that
was
the
only
reason
i
went
to
see
hawberk
he
had
never
interested
me
personally
nor
did
constance
except
for
the
fact
of
her
being
in
love
with
louis
this
did
occupy
my
attention
and
sometimes
even
kept
me
awake
at
night
but
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
all
would
come
right
and
that
i
should
arrange
their
future
as
i
expected
to
arrange
that
of
my
kind
doctor
john
archer
however
i
should
never
have
troubled
myself
about
visiting
them
just
then
had
it
not
been
as
i
say
that
the
music
of
the
tinkling
hammer
had
for
me
this
strong
fascination
i
would
sit
for
hours
listening
and
listening
and
when
a
stray
sunbeam
struck
the
inlaid
steel
the
sensation
it
gave
me
was
almost
too
keen
to
endure
my
eyes
would
become
fixed
dilating
with
a
pleasure
that
stretched
every
nerve
almost
to
breaking
until
some
movement
of
the
old
armourer
cut
off
the
ray
of
sunlight
then
still
thrilling
secretly
i
leaned
back
and
listened
again
to
the
sound
of
the
polishing
rag
swish
swish
rubbing
rust
from
the
rivets
constance
worked
with
the
embroidery
over
her
knees
now
and
then
pausing
to
examine
more
closely
the
pattern
in
the
coloured
plate
from
the
metropolitan
museum
who
is
this
for
i
asked
hawberk
explained
that
in
addition
to
the
treasures
of
armour
in
the
metropolitan
museum
of
which
he
had
been
appointed
armourer
he
also
had
charge
of
several
collections
belonging
to
rich
amateurs
this
was
the
missing
greave
of
a
famous
suit
which
a
client
of
his
had
traced
to
a
little
shop
in
paris
on
the
quai
d'orsay
he
hawberk
had
negotiated
for
and
secured
the
greave
and
now
the
suit
was
complete
he
laid
down
his
hammer
and
read
me
the
history
of
the
suit
traced
since
1450
from
owner
to
owner
until
it
was
acquired
by
thomas
stainbridge
when
his
superb
collection
was
sold
this
client
of
hawberk's
bought
the
suit
and
since
then
the
search
for
the
missing
greave
had
been
pushed
until
it
was
almost
by
accident
located
in
paris
did
you
continue
the
search
so
persistently
without
any
certainty
of
the
greave
being
still
in
existence
i
demanded
of
course
he
replied
coolly
then
for
the
first
time
i
took
a
personal
interest
in
hawberk
it
was
worth
something
to
you
i
ventured
no
he
replied
laughing
my
pleasure
in
finding
it
was
my
reward
have
you
no
ambition
to
be
rich
i
asked
smiling
my
one
ambition
is
to
be
the
best
armourer
in
the
world
he
answered
gravely
constance
asked
me
if
i
had
seen
the
ceremonies
at
the
lethal
chamber
she
herself
had
noticed
cavalry
passing
up
broadway
that
morning
and
had
wished
to
see
the
inauguration
but
her
father
wanted
the
banner
finished
and
she
had
stayed
at
his
request
did
you
see
your
cousin
mr
castaigne
there
she
asked
with
the
slightest
tremor
of
her
soft
eyelashes
no
i
replied
carelessly
louis'
regiment
is
manoeuvring
out
in
westchester
county
i
rose
and
picked
up
my
hat
and
cane
are
you
going
upstairs
to
see
the
lunatic
again
laughed
old
hawberk
if
hawberk
knew
how
i
loathe
that
word
lunatic
he
would
never
use
it
in
my
presence
it
rouses
certain
feelings
within
me
which
i
do
not
care
to
explain
however
i
answered
him
quietly
i
think
i
shall
drop
in
and
see
mr
wilde
for
a
moment
or
two
poor
fellow
said
constance
with
a
shake
of
the
head
it
must
be
hard
to
live
alone
year
after
year
poor
crippled
and
almost
demented
it
is
very
good
of
you
mr
castaigne
to
visit
him
as
often
as
you
do
i
think
he
is
vicious
observed
hawberk
beginning
again
with
his
hammer
i
listened
to
the
golden
tinkle
on
the
greave
plates
when
he
had
finished
i
replied
no
he
is
not
vicious
nor
is
he
in
the
least
demented
his
mind
is
a
wonder
chamber
from
which
he
can
extract
treasures
that
you
and
i
would
give
years
of
our
life
to
acquire'
hawberk
laughed
i
continued
a
little
impatiently
he
knows
history
as
no
one
else
could
know
it
nothing
however
trivial
escapes
his
search
and
his
memory
is
so
absolute
so
precise
in
details
that
were
it
known
in
new
york
that
such
a
man
existed
the
people
could
not
honour
him
enough
nonsense
muttered
hawberk
searching
on
the
floor
for
a
fallen
rivet
is
it
nonsense
i
asked
managing
to
suppress
what
i
felt
is
it
nonsense
when
he
says
that
the
tassets
and
cuissards
of
the
enamelled
suit
of
armour
commonly
known
as
the
'prince's
emblazoned'
can
be
found
among
a
mass
of
rusty
theatrical
properties
broken
stoves
and
ragpicker's
refuse
in
a
garret
in
pell
street
hawberk's
hammer
fell
to
the
ground
but
he
picked
it
up
and
asked
with
a
great
deal
of
calm
how
i
knew
that
the
tassets
and
left
cuissard
were
missing
from
the
prince's
emblazoned
i
did
not
know
until
mr
wilde
mentioned
it
to
me
the
other
day
he
said
they
were
in
the
garret
of
998
pell
street
nonsense
he
cried
but
i
noticed
his
hand
trembling
under
his
leathern
apron
is
this
nonsense
too
i
asked
pleasantly
is
it
nonsense
when
mr
wilde
continually
speaks
of
you
as
the
marquis
of
avonshire
and
of
miss
constance--
i
did
not
finish
for
constance
had
started
to
her
feet
with
terror
written
on
every
feature
hawberk
looked
at
me
and
slowly
smoothed
his
leathern
apron
that
is
impossible
he
observed
mr
wilde
may
know
a
great
many
things--
about
armour
for
instance
and
the
'prince's
emblazoned'
i
interposed
smiling
yes
he
continued
slowly
about
armour
also--may
be--but
he
is
wrong
in
regard
to
the
marquis
of
avonshire
who
as
you
know
killed
his
wife's
traducer
years
ago
and
went
to
australia
where
he
did
not
long
survive
his
wife
mr
wilde
is
wrong
murmured
constance
her
lips
were
blanched
but
her
voice
was
sweet
and
calm
let
us
agree
if
you
please
that
in
this
one
circumstance
mr
wilde
is
wrong
i
said
ii
i
climbed
the
three
dilapidated
flights
of
stairs
which
i
had
so
often
climbed
before
and
knocked
at
a
small
door
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
mr
wilde
opened
the
door
and
i
walked
in
when
he
had
double-locked
the
door
and
pushed
a
heavy
chest
against
it
he
came
and
sat
down
beside
me
peering
up
into
my
face
with
his
little
light-coloured
eyes
half
a
dozen
new
scratches
covered
his
nose
and
cheeks
and
the
silver
wires
which
supported
his
artificial
ears
had
become
displaced
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
him
so
hideously
fascinating
he
had
no
ears
the
artificial
ones
which
now
stood
out
at
an
angle
from
the
fine
wire
were
his
one
weakness
they
were
made
of
wax
and
painted
a
shell
pink
but
the
rest
of
his
face
was
yellow
he
might
better
have
revelled
in
the
luxury
of
some
artificial
fingers
for
his
left
hand
which
was
absolutely
fingerless
but
it
seemed
to
cause
him
no
inconvenience
and
he
was
satisfied
with
his
wax
ears
he
was
very
small
scarcely
higher
than
a
child
of
ten
but
his
arms
were
magnificently
developed
and
his
thighs
as
thick
as
any
athlete's
still
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
mr
wilde
was
that
a
man
of
his
marvellous
intelligence
and
knowledge
should
have
such
a
head
it
was
flat
and
pointed
like
the
heads
of
many
of
those
unfortunates
whom
people
imprison
in
asylums
for
the
weak-minded
many
called
him
insane
but
i
knew
him
to
be
as
sane
as
i
was
i
do
not
deny
that
he
was
eccentric
the
mania
he
had
for
keeping
that
cat
and
teasing
her
until
she
flew
at
his
face
like
a
demon
was
certainly
eccentric
i
never
could
understand
why
he
kept
the
creature
nor
what
pleasure
he
found
in
shutting
himself
up
in
his
room
with
this
surly
vicious
beast
i
remember
once
glancing
up
from
the
manuscript
i
was
studying
by
the
light
of
some
tallow
dips
and
seeing
mr
wilde
squatting
motionless
on
his
high
chair
his
eyes
fairly
blazing
with
excitement
while
the
cat
which
had
risen
from
her
place
before
the
stove
came
creeping
across
the
floor
right
at
him
before
i
could
move
she
flattened
her
belly
to
the
ground
crouched
trembled
and
sprang
into
his
face
howling
and
foaming
they
rolled
over
and
over
on
the
floor
scratching
and
clawing
until
the
cat
screamed
and
fled
under
the
cabinet
and
mr
wilde
turned
over
on
his
back
his
limbs
contracting
and
curling
up
like
the
legs
of
a
dying
spider
he
was
eccentric
mr
wilde
had
climbed
into
his
high
chair
and
after
studying
my
face
picked
up
a
dog's-eared
ledger
and
opened
it

well
i
said
the
profession
of
a
repairer
of
reputations
is
lucrative
his
colourless
eyes
sought
mine
i
only
wanted
to
demonstrate
that
i
was
correct
you
said
it
was
impossible
to
succeed
as
a
repairer
of
reputations
that
even
if
i
did
succeed
in
certain
cases
it
would
cost
me
more
than
i
would
gain
by
it
to-day
i
have
five
hundred
men
in
my
employ
who
are
poorly
paid
but
who
pursue
the
work
with
an
enthusiasm
which
possibly
may
be
born
of
fear
these
men
enter
every
shade
and
grade
of
society
some
even
are
pillars
of
the
most
exclusive
social
temples
others
are
the
prop
and
pride
of
the
financial
world
still
others
hold
undisputed
sway
among
the
'fancy
and
the
talent'
i
choose
them
at
my
leisure
from
those
who
reply
to
my
advertisements
it
is
easy
enough
they
are
all
cowards
i
could
treble
the
number
in
twenty
days
if
i
wished
so
you
see
those
who
have
in
their
keeping
the
reputations
of
their
fellow-citizens
i
have
in
my
pay
they
may
turn
on
you
i
suggested
he
rubbed
his
thumb
over
his
cropped
ears
and
adjusted
the
wax
substitutes
i
think
not
he
murmured
thoughtfully
i
seldom
have
to
apply
the
whip
and
then
only
once
besides
they
like
their
wages
how
do
you
apply
the
whip
i
demanded
his
face
for
a
moment
was
awful
to
look
upon
his
eyes
dwindled
to
a
pair
of
green
sparks
i
invite
them
to
come
and
have
a
little
chat
with
me
he
said
in
a
soft
voice
a
knock
at
the
door
interrupted
him
and
his
face
resumed
its
amiable
expression
who
is
it
he
inquired
mr
steylette
was
the
answer
come
to-morrow
replied
mr
wilde
impossible
began
the
other
but
was
silenced
by
a
sort
of
bark
from
mr
wilde
come
to-morrow
he
repeated
we
heard
somebody
move
away
from
the
door
and
turn
the
corner
by
the
stairway
who
is
that
i
asked
arnold
steylette
owner
and
editor
in
chief
of
the
great
new
york
daily
he
drummed
on
the
ledger
with
his
fingerless
hand
adding
i
pay
him
very
badly
but
he
thinks
it
a
good
bargain
arnold
steylette
i
repeated
amazed
yes
said
mr
wilde
with
a
self-satisfied
cough
the
cat
which
had
entered
the
room
as
he
spoke
hesitated
looked
up
at
him
and
snarled
he
climbed
down
from
the
chair
and
squatting
on
the
floor
took
the
creature
into
his
arms
and
caressed
her
the
cat
ceased
snarling
and
presently
began
a
loud
purring
which
seemed
to
increase
in
timbre
as
he
stroked
her
where
are
the
notes
i
asked
he
pointed
to
the
table
and
for
the
hundredth
time
i
picked
up
the
bundle
of
manuscript
entitled--
the
imperial
dynasty
of
america
one
by
one
i
studied
the
well-worn
pages
worn
only
by
my
own
handling
and
although
i
knew
all
by
heart
from
the
beginning
when
from
carcosa
the
hyades
hastur
and
aldebaran
to
castaigne
louis
de
calvados
born
december
19th
1877
i
read
it
with
an
eager
rapt
attention
pausing
to
repeat
parts
of
it
aloud
and
dwelling
especially
on
hildred
de
calvados
only
son
of
hildred
castaigne
and
edythe
landes
castaigne
first
in
succession
etc
etc
when
i
finished
mr
wilde
nodded
and
coughed
speaking
of
your
legitimate
ambition
he
said
how
do
constance
and
louis
get
along
she
loves
him
i
replied
simply
the
cat
on
his
knee
suddenly
turned
and
struck
at
his
eyes
and
he
flung
her
off
and
climbed
on
to
the
chair
opposite
me
and
dr
archer
but
that's
a
matter
you
can
settle
any
time
you
wish
he
added
yes
i
replied
dr
archer
can
wait
but
it
is
time
i
saw
my
cousin
louis
it
is
time
he
repeated
then
he
took
another
ledger
from
the
table
and
ran
over
the
leaves
rapidly
we
are
now
in
communication
with
ten
thousand
men
he
muttered
we
can
count
on
one
hundred
thousand
within
the
first
twenty-eight
hours
and
in
forty-eight
hours
the
state
will
rise
en
masse
the
country
follows
the
state
and
the
portion
that
will
not
i
mean
california
and
the
northwest
might
better
never
have
been
inhabited
i
shall
not
send
them
the
yellow
sign
the
blood
rushed
to
my
head
but
i
only
answered
a
new
broom
sweeps
clean
the
ambition
of
caesar
and
of
napoleon
pales
before
that
which
could
not
rest
until
it
had
seized
the
minds
of
men
and
controlled
even
their
unborn
thoughts
said
mr
wilde
you
are
speaking
of
the
king
in
yellow
i
groaned
with
a
shudder
he
is
a
king
whom
emperors
have
served
i
am
content
to
serve
him
i
replied
mr
wilde
sat
rubbing
his
ears
with
his
crippled
hand
perhaps
constance
does
not
love
him
he
suggested
i
started
to
reply
but
a
sudden
burst
of
military
music
from
the
street
below
drowned
my
voice
the
twentieth
dragoon
regiment
formerly
in
garrison
at
mount
st
vincent
was
returning
from
the
manoeuvres
in
westchester
county
to
its
new
barracks
on
east
washington
square
it
was
my
cousin's
regiment
they
were
a
fine
lot
of
fellows
in
their
pale
blue
tight-fitting
jackets
jaunty
busbys
and
white
riding
breeches
with
the
double
yellow
stripe
into
which
their
limbs
seemed
moulded
every
other
squadron
was
armed
with
lances
from
the
metal
points
of
which
fluttered
yellow
and
white
pennons
the
band
passed
playing
the
regimental
march
then
came
the
colonel
and
staff
the
horses
crowding
and
trampling
while
their
heads
bobbed
in
unison
and
the
pennons
fluttered
from
their
lance
points
the
troopers
who
rode
with
the
beautiful
english
seat
looked
brown
as
berries
from
their
bloodless
campaign
among
the
farms
of
westchester
and
the
music
of
their
sabres
against
the
stirrups
and
the
jingle
of
spurs
and
carbines
was
delightful
to
me
i
saw
louis
riding
with
his
squadron
he
was
as
handsome
an
officer
as
i
have
ever
seen
mr
wilde
who
had
mounted
a
chair
by
the
window
saw
him
too
but
said
nothing
louis
turned
and
looked
straight
at
hawberk's
shop
as
he
passed
and
i
could
see
the
flush
on
his
brown
cheeks
i
think
constance
must
have
been
at
the
window
when
the
last
troopers
had
clattered
by
and
the
last
pennons
vanished
into
south
fifth
avenue
mr
wilde
clambered
out
of
his
chair
and
dragged
the
chest
away
from
the
door
yes
he
said
it
is
time
that
you
saw
your
cousin
louis
he
unlocked
the
door
and
i
picked
up
my
hat
and
stick
and
stepped
into
the
corridor
the
stairs
were
dark
groping
about
i
set
my
foot
on
something
soft
which
snarled
and
spit
and
i
aimed
a
murderous
blow
at
the
cat
but
my
cane
shivered
to
splinters
against
the
balustrade
and
the
beast
scurried
back
into
mr
wilde's
room
passing
hawberk's
door
again
i
saw
him
still
at
work
on
the
armour
but
i
did
not
stop
and
stepping
out
into
bleecker
street
i
followed
it
to
wooster
skirted
the
grounds
of
the
lethal
chamber
and
crossing
washington
park
went
straight
to
my
rooms
in
the
benedick
here
i
lunched
comfortably
read
the
herald
and
the
meteor
and
finally
went
to
the
steel
safe
in
my
bedroom
and
set
the
time
combination
the
three
and
three-quarter
minutes
which
it
is
necessary
to
wait
while
the
time
lock
is
opening
are
to
me
golden
moments
from
the
instant
i
set
the
combination
to
the
moment
when
i
grasp
the
knobs
and
swing
back
the
solid
steel
doors
i
live
in
an
ecstasy
of
expectation
those
moments
must
be
like
moments
passed
in
paradise
i
know
what
i
am
to
find
at
the
end
of
the
time
limit
i
know
what
the
massive
safe
holds
secure
for
me
for
me
alone
and
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
waiting
is
hardly
enhanced
when
the
safe
opens
and
i
lift
from
its
velvet
crown
a
diadem
of
purest
gold
blazing
with
diamonds
i
do
this
every
day
and
yet
the
joy
of
waiting
and
at
last
touching
again
the
diadem
only
seems
to
increase
as
the
days
pass
it
is
a
diadem
fit
for
a
king
among
kings
an
emperor
among
emperors
the
king
in
yellow
might
scorn
it
but
it
shall
be
worn
by
his
royal
servant
i
held
it
in
my
arms
until
the
alarm
in
the
safe
rang
harshly
and
then
tenderly
proudly
i
replaced
it
and
shut
the
steel
doors
i
walked
slowly
back
into
my
study
which
faces
washington
square
and
leaned
on
the
window
sill
the
afternoon
sun
poured
into
my
windows
and
a
gentle
breeze
stirred
the
branches
of
the
elms
and
maples
in
the
park
now
covered
with
buds
and
tender
foliage
a
flock
of
pigeons
circled
about
the
tower
of
the
memorial
church
sometimes
alighting
on
the
purple
tiled
roof
sometimes
wheeling
downward
to
the
lotos
fountain
in
front
of
the
marble
arch
the
gardeners
were
busy
with
the
flower
beds
around
the
fountain
and
the
freshly
turned
earth
smelled
sweet
and
spicy
a
lawn
mower
drawn
by
a
fat
white
horse
clinked
across
the
green
sward
and
watering-carts
poured
showers
of
spray
over
the
asphalt
drives
around
the
statue
of
peter
stuyvesant
which
in
1897
had
replaced
the
monstrosity
supposed
to
represent
garibaldi
children
played
in
the
spring
sunshine
and
nurse
girls
wheeled
elaborate
baby
carriages
with
a
reckless
disregard
for
the
pasty-faced
occupants
which
could
probably
be
explained
by
the
presence
of
half
a
dozen
trim
dragoon
troopers
languidly
lolling
on
the
benches
through
the
trees
the
washington
memorial
arch
glistened
like
silver
in
the
sunshine
and
beyond
on
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
square
the
grey
stone
barracks
of
the
dragoons
and
the
white
granite
artillery
stables
were
alive
with
colour
and
motion
i
looked
at
the
lethal
chamber
on
the
corner
of
the
square
opposite
a
few
curious
people
still
lingered
about
the
gilded
iron
railing
but
inside
the
grounds
the
paths
were
deserted
i
watched
the
fountains
ripple
and
sparkle
the
sparrows
had
already
found
this
new
bathing
nook
and
the
basins
were
covered
with
the
dusty-feathered
little
things
two
or
three
white
peacocks
picked
their
way
across
the
lawns
and
a
drab
coloured
pigeon
sat
so
motionless
on
the
arm
of
one
of
the
fates
that
it
seemed
to
be
a
part
of
the
sculptured
stone
as
i
was
turning
carelessly
away
a
slight
commotion
in
the
group
of
curious
loiterers
around
the
gates
attracted
my
attention
a
young
man
had
entered
and
was
advancing
with
nervous
strides
along
the
gravel
path
which
leads
to
the
bronze
doors
of
the
lethal
chamber
he
paused
a
moment
before
the
fates
and
as
he
raised
his
head
to
those
three
mysterious
faces
the
pigeon
rose
from
its
sculptured
perch
circled
about
for
a
moment
and
wheeled
to
the
east
the
young
man
pressed
his
hand
to
his
face
and
then
with
an
undefinable
gesture
sprang
up
the
marble
steps
the
bronze
doors
closed
behind
him
and
half
an
hour
later
the
loiterers
slouched
away
and
the
frightened
pigeon
returned
to
its
perch
in
the
arms
of
fate
i
put
on
my
hat
and
went
out
into
the
park
for
a
little
walk
before
dinner
as
i
crossed
the
central
driveway
a
group
of
officers
passed
and
one
of
them
called
out
hello
hildred
and
came
back
to
shake
hands
with
me
it
was
my
cousin
louis
who
stood
smiling
and
tapping
his
spurred
heels
with
his
riding-whip
just
back
from
westchester
he
said
been
doing
the
bucolic
milk
and
curds
you
know
dairy-maids
in
sunbonnets
who
say
'haeow'
and
'i
don't
think'
when
you
tell
them
they
are
pretty
i'm
nearly
dead
for
a
square
meal
at
delmonico's
what's
the
news
there
is
none
i
replied
pleasantly
i
saw
your
regiment
coming
in
this
morning
did
you
i
didn't
see
you
where
were
you
in
mr
wilde's
window
oh
hell
he
began
impatiently
that
man
is
stark
mad
i
don't
understand
why
you--
he
saw
how
annoyed
i
felt
by
this
outburst
and
begged
my
pardon
really
old
chap
he
said
i
don't
mean
to
run
down
a
man
you
like
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
can't
see
what
the
deuce
you
find
in
common
with
mr
wilde
he's
not
well
bred
to
put
it
generously
he
is
hideously
deformed
his
head
is
the
head
of
a
criminally
insane
person
you
know
yourself
he's
been
in
an
asylum--
so
have
i
i
interrupted
calmly
louis
looked
startled
and
confused
for
a
moment
but
recovered
and
slapped
me
heartily
on
the
shoulder
you
were
completely
cured
he
began
but
i
stopped
him
again
i
suppose
you
mean
that
i
was
simply
acknowledged
never
to
have
been
insane
of
course
that--that's
what
i
meant
he
laughed
i
disliked
his
laugh
because
i
knew
it
was
forced
but
i
nodded
gaily
and
asked
him
where
he
was
going
louis
looked
after
his
brother
officers
who
had
now
almost
reached
broadway
we
had
intended
to
sample
a
brunswick
cocktail
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
anxious
for
an
excuse
to
go
and
see
hawberk
instead
come
along
i'll
make
you
my
excuse
we
found
old
hawberk
neatly
attired
in
a
fresh
spring
suit
standing
at
the
door
of
his
shop
and
sniffing
the
air
i
had
just
decided
to
take
constance
for
a
little
stroll
before
dinner
he
replied
to
the
impetuous
volley
of
questions
from
louis
we
thought
of
walking
on
the
park
terrace
along
the
north
river
at
that
moment
constance
appeared
and
grew
pale
and
rosy
by
turns
as
louis
bent
over
her
small
gloved
fingers
i
tried
to
excuse
myself
alleging
an
engagement
uptown
but
louis
and
constance
would
not
listen
and
i
saw
i
was
expected
to
remain
and
engage
old
hawberk's
attention
after
all
it
would
be
just
as
well
if
i
kept
my
eye
on
louis
i
thought
and
when
they
hailed
a
spring
street
horse-car
i
got
in
after
them
and
took
my
seat
beside
the
armourer
the
beautiful
line
of
parks
and
granite
terraces
overlooking
the
wharves
along
the
north
river
which
were
built
in
1910
and
finished
in
the
autumn
of
1917
had
become
one
of
the
most
popular
promenades
in
the
metropolis
they
extended
from
the
battery
to
190th
street
overlooking
the
noble
river
and
affording
a
fine
view
of
the
jersey
shore
and
the
highlands
opposite
cafã©s
and
restaurants
were
scattered
here
and
there
among
the
trees
and
twice
a
week
military
bands
from
the
garrison
played
in
the
kiosques
on
the
parapets
we
sat
down
in
the
sunshine
on
the
bench
at
the
foot
of
the
equestrian
statue
of
general
sheridan
constance
tipped
her
sunshade
to
shield
her
eyes
and
she
and
louis
began
a
murmuring
conversation
which
was
impossible
to
catch
old
hawberk
leaning
on
his
ivory
headed
cane
lighted
an
excellent
cigar
the
mate
to
which
i
politely
refused
and
smiled
at
vacancy
the
sun
hung
low
above
the
staten
island
woods
and
the
bay
was
dyed
with
golden
hues
reflected
from
the
sun-warmed
sails
of
the
shipping
in
the
harbour
brigs
schooners
yachts
clumsy
ferry-boats
their
decks
swarming
with
people
railroad
transports
carrying
lines
of
brown
blue
and
white
freight
cars
stately
sound
steamers
dã©classã©
tramp
steamers
coasters
dredgers
scows
and
everywhere
pervading
the
entire
bay
impudent
little
tugs
puffing
and
whistling
officiously--these
were
the
craft
which
churned
the
sunlight
waters
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
in
calm
contrast
to
the
hurry
of
sailing
vessel
and
steamer
a
silent
fleet
of
white
warships
lay
motionless
in
midstream
constance's
merry
laugh
aroused
me
from
my
reverie
what
are
you
staring
at
she
inquired
nothing--the
fleet
i
smiled
then
louis
told
us
what
the
vessels
were
pointing
out
each
by
its
relative
position
to
the
old
red
fort
on
governor's
island
that
little
cigar
shaped
thing
is
a
torpedo
boat
he
explained
there
are
four
more
lying
close
together
they
are
the
tarpon
the
falcon
the
sea
fox
and
the
octopus
the
gun-boats
just
above
are
the
princeton
the
champlain
the
still
water
and
the
erie
next
to
them
lie
the
cruisers
faragut
and
los
angeles
and
above
them
the
battle
ships
california
and
dakota
and
the
washington
which
is
the
flag
ship
those
two
squatty
looking
chunks
of
metal
which
are
anchored
there
off
castle
william
are
the
double
turreted
monitors
terrible
and
magnificent
behind
them
lies
the
ram
osceola
constance
looked
at
him
with
deep
approval
in
her
beautiful
eyes
what
loads
of
things
you
know
for
a
soldier
she
said
and
we
all
joined
in
the
laugh
which
followed
presently
louis
rose
with
a
nod
to
us
and
offered
his
arm
to
constance
and
they
strolled
away
along
the
river
wall
hawberk
watched
them
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
to
me
mr
wilde
was
right
he
said
i
have
found
the
missing
tassets
and
left
cuissard
of
the
'prince's
emblazoned'
in
a
vile
old
junk
garret
in
pell
street
998
i
inquired
with
a
smile
yes
mr
wilde
is
a
very
intelligent
man
i
observed
i
want
to
give
him
the
credit
of
this
most
important
discovery
continued
hawberk
and
i
intend
it
shall
be
known
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
fame
of
it
he
won't
thank
you
for
that
i
answered
sharply
please
say
nothing
about
it
do
you
know
what
it
is
worth
said
hawberk
no
fifty
dollars
perhaps
it
is
valued
at
five
hundred
but
the
owner
of
the
'prince's
emblazoned'
will
give
two
thousand
dollars
to
the
person
who
completes
his
suit
that
reward
also
belongs
to
mr
wilde
he
doesn't
want
it
he
refuses
it
i
answered
angrily
what
do
you
know
about
mr
wilde
he
doesn't
need
the
money
he
is
rich--or
will
be--richer
than
any
living
man
except
myself
what
will
we
care
for
money
then--what
will
we
care
he
and
i
when--when--
when
what
demanded
hawberk
astonished
you
will
see
i
replied
on
my
guard
again
he
looked
at
me
narrowly
much
as
doctor
archer
used
to
and
i
knew
he
thought
i
was
mentally
unsound
perhaps
it
was
fortunate
for
him
that
he
did
not
use
the
word
lunatic
just
then
no
i
replied
to
his
unspoken
thought
i
am
not
mentally
weak
my
mind
is
as
healthy
as
mr
wilde's
i
do
not
care
to
explain
just
yet
what
i
have
on
hand
but
it
is
an
investment
which
will
pay
more
than
mere
gold
silver
and
precious
stones
it
will
secure
the
happiness
and
prosperity
of
a
continent--yes
a
hemisphere
oh
said
hawberk
and
eventually
i
continued
more
quietly
it
will
secure
the
happiness
of
the
whole
world
and
incidentally
your
own
happiness
and
prosperity
as
well
as
mr
wilde's
exactly
i
smiled
but
i
could
have
throttled
him
for
taking
that
tone
he
looked
at
me
in
silence
for
a
while
and
then
said
very
gently
why
don't
you
give
up
your
books
and
studies
mr
castaigne
and
take
a
tramp
among
the
mountains
somewhere
or
other
you
used
to
be
fond
of
fishing
take
a
cast
or
two
at
the
trout
in
the
rangelys
i
don't
care
for
fishing
any
more
i
answered
without
a
shade
of
annoyance
in
my
voice
you
used
to
be
fond
of
everything
he
continued
athletics
yachting
shooting
riding--
i
have
never
cared
to
ride
since
my
fall
i
said
quietly
ah
yes
your
fall
he
repeated
looking
away
from
me
i
thought
this
nonsense
had
gone
far
enough
so
i
brought
the
conversation
back
to
mr
wilde
but
he
was
scanning
my
face
again
in
a
manner
highly
offensive
to
me
mr
wilde
he
repeated
do
you
know
what
he
did
this
afternoon
he
came
downstairs
and
nailed
a
sign
over
the
hall
door
next
to
mine
it
read
mr
wilde
repairer
of
reputations
third
bell
do
you
know
what
a
repairer
of
reputations
can
be
i
do
i
replied
suppressing
the
rage
within
oh
he
said
again
louis
and
constance
came
strolling
by
and
stopped
to
ask
if
we
would
join
them
hawberk
looked
at
his
watch
at
the
same
moment
a
puff
of
smoke
shot
from
the
casemates
of
castle
william
and
the
boom
of
the
sunset
gun
rolled
across
the
water
and
was
re-echoed
from
the
highlands
opposite
the
flag
came
running
down
from
the
flag-pole
the
bugles
sounded
on
the
white
decks
of
the
warships
and
the
first
electric
light
sparkled
out
from
the
jersey
shore
as
i
turned
into
the
city
with
hawberk
i
heard
constance
murmur
something
to
louis
which
i
did
not
understand
but
louis
whispered
my
darling
in
reply
and
again
walking
ahead
with
hawberk
through
the
square
i
heard
a
murmur
of
sweetheart
and
my
own
constance
and
i
knew
the
time
had
nearly
arrived
when
i
should
speak
of
important
matters
with
my
cousin
louis
iii
one
morning
early
in
may
i
stood
before
the
steel
safe
in
my
bedroom
trying
on
the
golden
jewelled
crown
the
diamonds
flashed
fire
as
i
turned
to
the
mirror
and
the
heavy
beaten
gold
burned
like
a
halo
about
my
head
i
remembered
camilla's
agonized
scream
and
the
awful
words
echoing
through
the
dim
streets
of
carcosa
they
were
the
last
lines
in
the
first
act
and
i
dared
not
think
of
what
followed--dared
not
even
in
the
spring
sunshine
there
in
my
own
room
surrounded
with
familiar
objects
reassured
by
the
bustle
from
the
street
and
the
voices
of
the
servants
in
the
hallway
outside
for
those
poisoned
words
had
dropped
slowly
into
my
heart
as
death-sweat
drops
upon
a
bed-sheet
and
is
absorbed
trembling
i
put
the
diadem
from
my
head
and
wiped
my
forehead
but
i
thought
of
hastur
and
of
my
own
rightful
ambition
and
i
remembered
mr
wilde
as
i
had
last
left
him
his
face
all
torn
and
bloody
from
the
claws
of
that
devil's
creature
and
what
he
said--ah
what
he
said
the
alarm
bell
in
the
safe
began
to
whirr
harshly
and
i
knew
my
time
was
up
but
i
would
not
heed
it
and
replacing
the
flashing
circlet
upon
my
head
i
turned
defiantly
to
the
mirror
i
stood
for
a
long
time
absorbed
in
the
changing
expression
of
my
own
eyes
the
mirror
reflected
a
face
which
was
like
my
own
but
whiter
and
so
thin
that
i
hardly
recognized
it
and
all
the
time
i
kept
repeating
between
my
clenched
teeth
the
day
has
come
the
day
has
come
while
the
alarm
in
the
safe
whirred
and
clamoured
and
the
diamonds
sparkled
and
flamed
above
my
brow
i
heard
a
door
open
but
did
not
heed
it
it
was
only
when
i
saw
two
faces
in
the
mirror--it
was
only
when
another
face
rose
over
my
shoulder
and
two
other
eyes
met
mine
i
wheeled
like
a
flash
and
seized
a
long
knife
from
my
dressing-table
and
my
cousin
sprang
back
very
pale
crying
hildred
for
god's
sake
then
as
my
hand
fell
he
said
it
is
i
louis
don't
you
know
me
i
stood
silent
i
could
not
have
spoken
for
my
life
he
walked
up
to
me
and
took
the
knife
from
my
hand
what
is
all
this
he
inquired
in
a
gentle
voice
are
you
ill
no
i
replied
but
i
doubt
if
he
heard
me
come
come
old
fellow
he
cried
take
off
that
brass
crown
and
toddle
into
the
study
are
you
going
to
a
masquerade
what's
all
this
theatrical
tinsel
anyway
i
was
glad
he
thought
the
crown
was
made
of
brass
and
paste
yet
i
didn't
like
him
any
the
better
for
thinking
so
i
let
him
take
it
from
my
hand
knowing
it
was
best
to
humour
him
he
tossed
the
splendid
diadem
in
the
air
and
catching
it
turned
to
me
smiling
it's
dear
at
fifty
cents
he
said
what's
it
for
i
did
not
answer
but
took
the
circlet
from
his
hands
and
placing
it
in
the
safe
shut
the
massive
steel
door
the
alarm
ceased
its
infernal
din
at
once
he
watched
me
curiously
but
did
not
seem
to
notice
the
sudden
ceasing
of
the
alarm
he
did
however
speak
of
the
safe
as
a
biscuit
box
fearing
lest
he
might
examine
the
combination
i
led
the
way
into
my
study
louis
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
and
flicked
at
flies
with
his
eternal
riding-whip
he
wore
his
fatigue
uniform
with
the
braided
jacket
and
jaunty
cap
and
i
noticed
that
his
riding-boots
were
all
splashed
with
red
mud
where
have
you
been
i
inquired
jumping
mud
creeks
in
jersey
he
said
i
haven't
had
time
to
change
yet
i
was
rather
in
a
hurry
to
see
you
haven't
you
got
a
glass
of
something
i'm
dead
tired
been
in
the
saddle
twenty-four
hours
i
gave
him
some
brandy
from
my
medicinal
store
which
he
drank
with
a
grimace
damned
bad
stuff
he
observed
i'll
give
you
an
address
where
they
sell
brandy
that
is
brandy
it's
good
enough
for
my
needs
i
said
indifferently
i
use
it
to
rub
my
chest
with
he
stared
and
flicked
at
another
fly
see
here
old
fellow
he
began
i've
got
something
to
suggest
to
you
it's
four
years
now
that
you've
shut
yourself
up
here
like
an
owl
never
going
anywhere
never
taking
any
healthy
exercise
never
doing
a
damn
thing
but
poring
over
those
books
up
there
on
the
mantelpiece
he
glanced
along
the
row
of
shelves
napoleon
napoleon
napoleon
he
read
for
heaven's
sake
have
you
nothing
but
napoleons
there
i
wish
they
were
bound
in
gold
i
said
but
wait
yes
there
is
another
book
the
king
in
yellow
i
looked
him
steadily
in
the
eye
have
you
never
read
it
i
asked
i
no
thank
god
i
don't
want
to
be
driven
crazy
i
saw
he
regretted
his
speech
as
soon
as
he
had
uttered
it
there
is
only
one
word
which
i
loathe
more
than
i
do
lunatic
and
that
word
is
crazy
but
i
controlled
myself
and
asked
him
why
he
thought
the
king
in
yellow
dangerous
oh
i
don't
know
he
said
hastily
i
only
remember
the
excitement
it
created
and
the
denunciations
from
pulpit
and
press
i
believe
the
author
shot
himself
after
bringing
forth
this
monstrosity
didn't
he
i
understand
he
is
still
alive
i
answered
that's
probably
true
he
muttered
bullets
couldn't
kill
a
fiend
like
that
it
is
a
book
of
great
truths
i
said
yes
he
replied
of
'truths'
which
send
men
frantic
and
blast
their
lives
i
don't
care
if
the
thing
is
as
they
say
the
very
supreme
essence
of
art
it's
a
crime
to
have
written
it
and
i
for
one
shall
never
open
its
pages
is
that
what
you
have
come
to
tell
me
i
asked
no
he
said
i
came
to
tell
you
that
i
am
going
to
be
married
i
believe
for
a
moment
my
heart
ceased
to
beat
but
i
kept
my
eyes
on
his
face
yes
he
continued
smiling
happily
married
to
the
sweetest
girl
on
earth
constance
hawberk
i
said
mechanically
how
did
you
know
he
cried
astonished
i
didn't
know
it
myself
until
that
evening
last
april
when
we
strolled
down
to
the
embankment
before
dinner
when
is
it
to
be
i
asked
it
was
to
have
been
next
september
but
an
hour
ago
a
despatch
came
ordering
our
regiment
to
the
presidio
san
francisco
we
leave
at
noon
to-morrow
to-morrow
he
repeated
just
think
hildred
to-morrow
i
shall
be
the
happiest
fellow
that
ever
drew
breath
in
this
jolly
world
for
constance
will
go
with
me
i
offered
him
my
hand
in
congratulation
and
he
seized
and
shook
it
like
the
good-natured
fool
he
was--or
pretended
to
be
i
am
going
to
get
my
squadron
as
a
wedding
present
he
rattled
on
captain
and
mrs
louis
castaigne
eh
hildred
then
he
told
me
where
it
was
to
be
and
who
were
to
be
there
and
made
me
promise
to
come
and
be
best
man
i
set
my
teeth
and
listened
to
his
boyish
chatter
without
showing
what
i
felt
but--
i
was
getting
to
the
limit
of
my
endurance
and
when
he
jumped
up
and
switching
his
spurs
till
they
jingled
said
he
must
go
i
did
not
detain
him
there's
one
thing
i
want
to
ask
of
you
i
said
quietly
out
with
it
it's
promised
he
laughed
i
want
you
to
meet
me
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour's
talk
to-night
of
course
if
you
wish
he
said
somewhat
puzzled
where
anywhere
in
the
park
there
what
time
hildred
midnight
what
in
the
name
of--
he
began
but
checked
himself
and
laughingly
assented
i
watched
him
go
down
the
stairs
and
hurry
away
his
sabre
banging
at
every
stride
he
turned
into
bleecker
street
and
i
knew
he
was
going
to
see
constance
i
gave
him
ten
minutes
to
disappear
and
then
followed
in
his
footsteps
taking
with
me
the
jewelled
crown
and
the
silken
robe
embroidered
with
the
yellow
sign
when
i
turned
into
bleecker
street
and
entered
the
doorway
which
bore
the
sign--
mr
wilde
repairer
of
reputations
third
bell
i
saw
old
hawberk
moving
about
in
his
shop
and
imagined
i
heard
constance's
voice
in
the
parlour
but
i
avoided
them
both
and
hurried
up
the
trembling
stairways
to
mr
wilde's
apartment
i
knocked
and
entered
without
ceremony
mr
wilde
lay
groaning
on
the
floor
his
face
covered
with
blood
his
clothes
torn
to
shreds
drops
of
blood
were
scattered
about
over
the
carpet
which
had
also
been
ripped
and
frayed
in
the
evidently
recent
struggle
it's
that
cursed
cat
he
said
ceasing
his
groans
and
turning
his
colourless
eyes
to
me
she
attacked
me
while
i
was
asleep
i
believe
she
will
kill
me
yet
this
was
too
much
so
i
went
into
the
kitchen
and
seizing
a
hatchet
from
the
pantry
started
to
find
the
infernal
beast
and
settle
her
then
and
there
my
search
was
fruitless
and
after
a
while
i
gave
it
up
and
came
back
to
find
mr
wilde
squatting
on
his
high
chair
by
the
table
he
had
washed
his
face
and
changed
his
clothes
the
great
furrows
which
the
cat's
claws
had
ploughed
up
in
his
face
he
had
filled
with
collodion
and
a
rag
hid
the
wound
in
his
throat
i
told
him
i
should
kill
the
cat
when
i
came
across
her
but
he
only
shook
his
head
and
turned
to
the
open
ledger
before
him
he
read
name
after
name
of
the
people
who
had
come
to
him
in
regard
to
their
reputation
and
the
sums
he
had
amassed
were
startling
i
put
on
the
screws
now
and
then
he
explained
one
day
or
other
some
of
these
people
will
assassinate
you
i
insisted
do
you
think
so
he
said
rubbing
his
mutilated
ears
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
him
so
i
took
down
the
manuscript
entitled
imperial
dynasty
of
america
for
the
last
time
i
should
ever
take
it
down
in
mr
wilde's
study
i
read
it
through
thrilling
and
trembling
with
pleasure
when
i
had
finished
mr
wilde
took
the
manuscript
and
turning
to
the
dark
passage
which
leads
from
his
study
to
his
bed-chamber
called
out
in
a
loud
voice
vance
then
for
the
first
time
i
noticed
a
man
crouching
there
in
the
shadow
how
i
had
overlooked
him
during
my
search
for
the
cat
i
cannot
imagine
vance
come
in
cried
mr
wilde
the
figure
rose
and
crept
towards
us
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
face
that
he
raised
to
mine
as
the
light
from
the
window
illuminated
it
vance
this
is
mr
castaigne
said
mr
wilde
before
he
had
finished
speaking
the
man
threw
himself
on
the
ground
before
the
table
crying
and
grasping
oh
god
oh
my
god
help
me
forgive
me
oh
mr
castaigne
keep
that
man
away
you
cannot
you
cannot
mean
it
you
are
different--save
me
i
am
broken
down--i
was
in
a
madhouse
and
now--when
all
was
coming
right--when
i
had
forgotten
the
king--the
king
in
yellow
and--but
i
shall
go
mad
again--i
shall
go
mad--
his
voice
died
into
a
choking
rattle
for
mr
wilde
had
leapt
on
him
and
his
right
hand
encircled
the
man's
throat
when
vance
fell
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
mr
wilde
clambered
nimbly
into
his
chair
again
and
rubbing
his
mangled
ears
with
the
stump
of
his
hand
turned
to
me
and
asked
me
for
the
ledger
i
reached
it
down
from
the
shelf
and
he
opened
it
after
a
moment's
searching
among
the
beautifully
written
pages
he
coughed
complacently
and
pointed
to
the
name
vance
vance
he
read
aloud
osgood
oswald
vance
at
the
sound
of
his
name
the
man
on
the
floor
raised
his
head
and
turned
a
convulsed
face
to
mr
wilde
his
eyes
were
injected
with
blood
his
lips

i
looked
at
the
man
on
the
floor
get
up
vance
said
mr
wilde
in
a
gentle
voice
vance
rose
as
if
hypnotized
he
will
do
as
we
suggest
now
observed
mr
wilde
and
opening
the
manuscript
he
read
the
entire
history
of
the
imperial
dynasty
of
america
then
in
a
kind
and
soothing
murmur
he
ran
over
the
important
points
with
vance
who
stood
like
one
stunned
his
eyes
were
so
blank
and
vacant
that
i
imagined
he
had
become
half-witted
and
remarked
it
to
mr
wilde
who
replied
that
it
was
of
no
consequence
anyway
very
patiently
we
pointed
out
to
vance
what
his
share
in
the
affair
would
be
and
he
seemed
to
understand
after
a
while
mr
wilde
explained
the
manuscript
using
several
volumes
on
heraldry
to
substantiate
the
result
of
his
researches
he
mentioned
the
establishment
of
the
dynasty
in
carcosa
the
lakes
which
connected
hastur
aldebaran
and
the
mystery
of
the
hyades
he
spoke
of
cassilda
and
camilla
and
sounded
the
cloudy
depths
of
demhe
and
the
lake
of
hali
the
scolloped
tatters
of
the
king
in
yellow
must
hide
yhtill
forever
he
muttered
but
i
do
not
believe
vance
heard
him
then
by
degrees
he
led
vance
along
the
ramifications
of
the
imperial
family
to
uoht
and
thale
from
naotalba
and
phantom
of
truth
to
aldones
and
then
tossing
aside
his
manuscript
and
notes
he
began
the
wonderful
story
of
the
last
king
fascinated
and
thrilled
i
watched
him
he
threw
up
his
head
his
long
arms
were
stretched
out
in
a
magnificent
gesture
of
pride
and
power
and
his
eyes
blazed
deep
in
their
sockets
like
two
emeralds
vance
listened
stupefied
as
for
me
when
at
last
mr
wilde
had
finished
and
pointing
to
me
cried
the
cousin
of
the
king
my
head
swam
with
excitement
controlling
myself
with
a
superhuman
effort
i
explained
to
vance
why
i
alone
was
worthy
of
the
crown
and
why
my
cousin
must
be
exiled
or
die
i
made
him
understand
that
my
cousin
must
never
marry
even
after
renouncing
all
his
claims
and
how
that
least
of
all
he
should
marry
the
daughter
of
the
marquis
of
avonshire
and
bring
england
into
the
question
i
showed
him
a
list
of
thousands
of
names
which
mr
wilde
had
drawn
up
every
man
whose
name
was
there
had
received
the
yellow
sign
which
no
living
human
being
dared
disregard
the
city
the
state
the
whole
land
were
ready
to
rise
and
tremble
before
the
pallid
mask
the
time
had
come
the
people
should
know
the
son
of
hastur
and
the
whole
world
bow
to
the
black
stars
which
hang
in
the
sky
over
carcosa
vance
leaned
on
the
table
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
mr
wilde
drew
a
rough
sketch
on
the
margin
of
yesterday's
herald
with
a
bit
of
lead
pencil
it
was
a
plan
of
hawberk's
rooms
then
he
wrote
out
the
order
and
affixed
the
seal
and
shaking
like
a
palsied
man
i
signed
my
first
writ
of
execution
with
my
name
hildred-rex
mr
wilde
clambered
to
the
floor
and
unlocking
the
cabinet
took
a
long
square
box
from
the
first
shelf
this
he
brought
to
the
table
and
opened
a
new
knife
lay
in
the
tissue
paper
inside
and
i
picked
it
up
and
handed
it
to
vance
along
with
the
order
and
the
plan
of
hawberk's
apartment
then
mr
wilde
told
vance
he
could
go
and
he
went
shambling
like
an
outcast
of
the
slums
i
sat
for
a
while
watching
the
daylight
fade
behind
the
square
tower
of
the
judson
memorial
church
and
finally
gathering
up
the
manuscript
and
notes
took
my
hat
and
started
for
the
door
mr
wilde
watched
me
in
silence
when
i
had
stepped
into
the
hall
i
looked
back
mr
wilde's
small
eyes
were
still
fixed
on
me
behind
him
the
shadows
gathered
in
the
fading
light
then
i
closed
the
door
behind
me
and
went
out
into
the
darkening
streets
i
had
eaten
nothing
since
breakfast
but
i
was
not
hungry
a
wretched
half-starved
creature
who
stood
looking
across
the
street
at
the
lethal
chamber
noticed
me
and
came
up
to
tell
me
a
tale
of
misery
i
gave
him
money
i
don't
know
why
and
he
went
away
without
thanking
me
an
hour
later
another
outcast
approached
and
whined
his
story
i
had
a
blank
bit
of
paper
in
my
pocket
on
which
was
traced
the
yellow
sign
and
i
handed
it
to
him
he
looked
at
it
stupidly
for
a
moment
and
then
with
an
uncertain
glance
at
me
folded
it
with
what
seemed
to
me
exaggerated
care
and
placed
it
in
his
bosom
the
electric
lights
were
sparkling
among
the
trees
and
the
new
moon
shone
in
the
sky
above
the
lethal
chamber
it
was
tiresome
waiting
in
the
square
i
wandered
from
the
marble
arch
to
the
artillery
stables
and
back
again
to
the
lotos
fountain
the
flowers
and
grass
exhaled
a
fragrance
which
troubled
me
the
jet
of
the
fountain
played
in
the
moonlight
and
the
musical
splash
of
falling
drops
reminded
me
of
the
tinkle
of
chained
mail
in
hawberk's
shop
but
it
was
not
so
fascinating
and
the
dull
sparkle
of
the
moonlight
on
the
water
brought
no
such
sensations
of
exquisite
pleasure
as
when
the
sunshine
played
over
the
polished
steel
of
a
corselet
on
hawberk's
knee
i
watched
the
bats
darting
and
turning
above
the
water
plants
in
the
fountain
basin
but
their
rapid
jerky
flight
set
my
nerves
on
edge
and
i
went
away
again
to
walk
aimlessly
to
and
fro
among
the
trees
the
artillery
stables
were
dark
but
in
the
cavalry
barracks
the
officers'
windows
were
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
sallyport
was
constantly
filled
with
troopers
in
fatigue
carrying
straw
and
harness
and
baskets
filled
with
tin
dishes
twice
the
mounted
sentry
at
the
gates
was
changed
while
i
wandered
up
and
down
the
asphalt
walk
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
nearly
time
the
lights
in
the
barracks
went
out
one
by
one
the
barred
gate
was
closed
and
every
minute
or
two
an
officer
passed
in
through
the
side
wicket
leaving
a
rattle
of
accoutrements
and
a
jingle
of
spurs
on
the
night
air
the
square
had
become
very
silent
the
last
homeless
loiterer
had
been
driven
away
by
the
grey-coated
park
policeman
the
car
tracks
along
wooster
street
were
deserted
and
the
only
sound
which
broke
the
stillness
was
the
stamping
of
the
sentry's
horse
and
the
ring
of
his
sabre
against
the
saddle
pommel
in
the
barracks
the
officers'
quarters
were
still
lighted
and
military
servants
passed
and
repassed
before
the
bay
windows
twelve
o'clock
sounded
from
the
new
spire
of
st
francis
xavier
and
at
the
last
stroke
of
the
sad-toned
bell
a
figure
passed
through
the
wicket
beside
the
portcullis
returned
the
salute
of
the
sentry
and
crossing
the
street
entered
the
square
and
advanced
toward
the
benedick
apartment
house
louis
i
called
the
man
pivoted
on
his
spurred
heels
and
came
straight
toward
me
is
that
you
hildred
yes
you
are
on
time
i
took
his
offered
hand
and
we
strolled
toward
the
lethal
chamber
he
rattled
on
about
his
wedding
and
the
graces
of
constance
and
their
future
prospects
calling
my
attention
to
his
captain's
shoulder-straps
and
the
triple
gold
arabesque
on
his
sleeve
and
fatigue
cap
i
believe
i
listened
as
much
to
the
music
of
his
spurs
and
sabre
as
i
did
to
his
boyish
babble
and
at
last
we
stood
under
the
elms
on
the
fourth
street
corner
of
the
square
opposite
the
lethal
chamber
then
he
laughed
and
asked
me
what
i
wanted
with
him
i
motioned
him
to
a
seat
on
a
bench
under
the
electric
light
and
sat
down
beside
him
he
looked
at
me
curiously
with
that
same
searching
glance
which
i
hate
and
fear
so
in
doctors
i
felt
the
insult
of
his
look
but
he
did
not
know
it
and
i
carefully
concealed
my
feelings
well
old
chap
he
inquired
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
drew
from
my
pocket
the
manuscript
and
notes
of
the
imperial
dynasty
of
america
and
looking
him
in
the
eye
said
i
will
tell
you
on
your
word
as
a
soldier
promise
me
to
read
this
manuscript
from
beginning
to
end
without
asking
me
a
question
promise
me
to
read
these
notes
in
the
same
way
and
promise
me
to
listen
to
what
i
have
to
tell
later
i
promise
if
you
wish
it
he
said
pleasantly
give
me
the
paper
hildred
he
began
to
read
raising
his
eyebrows
with
a
puzzled
whimsical
air
which
made
me
tremble
with
suppressed
anger
as
he
advanced
his
eyebrows
contracted
and
his
lips
seemed
to
form
the
word
rubbish
then
he
looked
slightly
bored
but
apparently
for
my
sake
read
with
an
attempt
at
interest
which
presently
ceased
to
be
an
effort
he
started
when
in
the
closely
written
pages
he
came
to
his
own
name
and
when
he
came
to
mine
he
lowered
the
paper
and
looked
sharply
at
me
for
a
moment
but
he
kept
his
word
and
resumed
his
reading
and
i
let
the
half-formed
question
die
on
his
lips
unanswered
when
he
came
to
the
end
and
read
the
signature
of
mr
wilde
he
folded
the
paper
carefully
and
returned
it
to
me
i
handed
him
the
notes
and
he
settled
back
pushing
his
fatigue
cap
up
to
his
forehead
with
a
boyish
gesture
which
i
remembered
so
well
in
school
i
watched
his
face
as
he
read
and
when
he
finished
i
took
the
notes
with
the
manuscript
and
placed
them
in
my
pocket
then
i
unfolded
a
scroll
marked
with
the
yellow
sign
he
saw
the
sign
but
he
did
not
seem
to
recognize
it
and
i
called
his
attention
to
it
somewhat
sharply
well
he
said
i
see
it
what
is
it
it
is
the
yellow
sign
i
said
angrily
oh
that's
it
is
it
said
louis
in
that
flattering
voice
which
doctor
archer
used
to
employ
with
me
and
would
probably
have
employed
again
had
i
not
settled
his
affair
for
him
i
kept
my
rage
down
and
answered
as
steadily
as
possible
listen
you
have
engaged
your
word
i
am
listening
old
chap
he
replied
soothingly
i
began
to
speak
very
calmly
dr
archer
having
by
some
means
become
possessed
of
the
secret
of
the
imperial
succession
attempted
to
deprive
me
of
my
right
alleging
that
because
of
a
fall
from
my
horse
four
years
ago
i
had
become
mentally
deficient
he
presumed
to
place
me
under
restraint
in
his
own
house
in
hopes
of
either
driving
me
insane
or
poisoning
me
i
have
not
forgotten
it
i
visited
him
last
night
and
the
interview
was
final
louis
turned
quite
pale
but
did
not
move
i
resumed
triumphantly
there
are
yet
three
people
to
be
interviewed
in
the
interests
of
mr
wilde
and
myself
they
are
my
cousin
louis
mr
hawberk
and
his
daughter
constance
louis
sprang
to
his
feet
and
i
arose
also
and
flung
the
paper
marked
with
the
yellow
sign
to
the
ground
oh
i
don't
need
that
to
tell
you
what
i
have
to
say
i
cried
with
a
laugh
of
triumph
you
must
renounce
the
crown
to
me
do
you
hear
to
me
louis
looked
at
me
with
a
startled
air
but
recovering
himself
said
kindly
of
course
i
renounce
the--what
is
it
i
must
renounce
the
crown
i
said
angrily
of
course
he
answered
i
renounce
it
come
old
chap
i'll
walk
back
to
your
rooms
with
you
don't
try
any
of
your
doctor's
tricks
on
me
i
cried
trembling
with
fury
don't
act
as
if
you
think
i
am
insane
what
nonsense
he
replied
come
it's
getting
late
hildred
no
i
shouted
you
must
listen
you
cannot
marry
i
forbid
it
do
you
hear
i
forbid
it
you
shall
renounce
the
crown
and
in
reward
i
grant
you
exile
but
if
you
refuse
you
shall
die
he
tried
to
calm
me
but
i
was
roused
at
last
and
drawing
my
long
knife
barred
his
way
then
i
told
him
how
they
would
find
dr
archer
in
the
cellar
with
his
throat
open
and
i
laughed
in
his
face
when
i
thought
of
vance
and
his
knife
and
the
order
signed
by
me
ah
you
are
the
king
i
cried
but
i
shall
be
king
who
are
you
to
keep
me
from
empire
over
all
the
habitable
earth
i
was
born
the
cousin
of
a
king
but
i
shall
be
king
louis
stood
white
and
rigid
before
me
suddenly
a
man
came
running
up
fourth
street
entered
the
gate
of
the
lethal
temple
traversed
the
path
to
the
bronze
doors
at
full
speed
and
plunged
into
the
death
chamber
with
the
cry
of
one
demented
and
i
laughed
until
i
wept
tears
for
i
had
recognized
vance
and
knew
that
hawberk
and
his
daughter
were
no
longer
in
my
way
go
i
cried
to
louis
you
have
ceased
to
be
a
menace
you
will
never
marry
constance
now
and
if
you
marry
any
one
else
in
your
exile
i
will
visit
you
as
i
did
my
doctor
last
night
mr
wilde
takes
charge
of
you
to-morrow
then
i
turned
and
darted
into
south
fifth
avenue
and
with
a
cry
of
terror
louis
dropped
his
belt
and
sabre
and
followed
me
like
the
wind
i
heard
him
close
behind
me
at
the
corner
of
bleecker
street
and
i
dashed
into
the
doorway
under
hawberk's
sign
he
cried
halt
or
i
fire
but
when
he
saw
that
i
flew
up
the
stairs
leaving
hawberk's
shop
below
he
left
me
and
i
heard
him
hammering
and
shouting
at
their
door
as
though
it
were
possible
to
arouse
the
dead
mr
wilde's
door
was
open
and
i
entered
crying
it
is
done
it
is
done
let
the
nations
rise
and
look
upon
their
king
but
i
could
not
find
mr
wilde
so
i
went
to
the
cabinet
and
took
the
splendid
diadem
from
its
case
then
i
drew
on
the
white
silk
robe
embroidered
with
the
yellow
sign
and
placed
the
crown
upon
my
head
at
last
i
was
king
king
by
my
right
in
hastur
king
because
i
knew
the
mystery
of
the
hyades
and
my
mind
had
sounded
the
depths
of
the
lake
of
hali
i
was
king
the
first
grey
pencillings
of
dawn
would
raise
a
tempest
which
would
shake
two
hemispheres
then
as
i
stood
my
every
nerve
pitched
to
the
highest
tension
faint
with
the
joy
and
splendour
of
my
thought
without
in
the
dark
passage
a
man
groaned
i
seized
the
tallow
dip
and
sprang
to
the
door
the
cat
passed
me
like
a
demon
and
the
tallow
dip
went
out
but
my
long
knife
flew
swifter
than
she
and
i
heard
her
screech
and
i
knew
that
my
knife
had
found
her
for
a
moment
i
listened
to
her
tumbling
and
thumping
about
in
the
darkness
and
then
when
her
frenzy
ceased
i
lighted
a
lamp
and
raised
it
over
my
head
mr
wilde
lay
on
the
floor
with
his
throat
torn
open
at
first
i
thought
he
was
dead
but
as
i
looked
a
green
sparkle
came
into
his
sunken
eyes
his
mutilated
hand
trembled
and
then
a
spasm
stretched
his
mouth
from
ear
to
ear
for
a
moment
my
terror
and
despair
gave
place
to
hope
but
as
i
bent
over
him
his
eyeballs
rolled
clean
around
in
his
head
and
he
died
then
while
i
stood
transfixed
with
rage
and
despair
seeing
my
crown
my
empire
every
hope
and
every
ambition
my
very
life
lying
prostrate
there
with
the
dead
master
they
came
seized
me
from
behind
and
bound
me
until
my
veins
stood
out
like
cords
and
my
voice
failed
with
the
paroxysms
of
my
frenzied
screams
but
i
still
raged
bleeding
and
infuriated
among
them
and
more
than
one
policeman
felt
my
sharp
teeth
then
when
i
could
no
longer
move
they
came
nearer
i
saw
old
hawberk
and
behind
him
my
cousin
louis'
ghastly
face
and
farther
away
in
the
corner
a
woman
constance
weeping
softly
ah
i
see
it
now
i
shrieked
you
have
seized
the
throne
and
the
empire
woe
woe
to
you
who
are
crowned
with
the
crown
of
the
king

i
although
i
knew
nothing
of
chemistry
i
listened
fascinated
he
picked
up
an
easter
lily
which
geneviã¨ve
had
brought
that
morning
from
notre
dame
and
dropped
it
into
the
basin
instantly
the
liquid
lost
its
crystalline
clearness
for
a
second
the
lily
was
enveloped
in
a
milk-white
foam
which
disappeared
leaving
the
fluid
opalescent
changing
tints
of
orange
and
crimson
played
over
the
surface
and
then
what
seemed
to
be
a
ray
of
pure
sunlight
struck
through
from
the
bottom
where
the
lily
was
resting
at
the
same
instant
he
plunged
his
hand
into
the
basin
and
drew
out
the
flower
there
is
no
danger
he
explained
if
you
choose
the
right
moment
that
golden
ray
is
the
signal
he
held
the
lily
toward
me
and
i
took
it
in
my
hand
it
had
turned
to
stone
to
the
purest
marble
you
see
he
said
it
is
without
a
flaw
what
sculptor
could
reproduce
it
the
marble
was
white
as
snow
but
in
its
depths
the
veins
of
the
lily
were
tinged
with
palest
azure
and
a
faint
flush
lingered
deep
in
its
heart
don't
ask
me
the
reason
of
that
he
smiled
noticing
my
wonder
i
have
no
idea
why
the
veins
and
heart
are
tinted
but
they
always
are
yesterday
i
tried
one
of
geneviã¨ve's
gold-fish--there
it
is
the
fish
looked
as
if
sculptured
in
marble
but
if
you
held
it
to
the
light
the
stone
was
beautifully
veined
with
a
faint
blue
and
from
somewhere
within
came
a
rosy
light
like
the
tint
which
slumbers
in
an
opal
i
looked
into
the
basin
once
more
it
seemed
filled
with
clearest
crystal
if
i
should
touch
it
now
i
demanded
i
don't
know
he
replied
but
you
had
better
not
try
there
is
one
thing
i'm
curious
about
i
said
and
that
is
where
the
ray
of
sunlight
came
from
it
looked
like
a
sunbeam
true
enough
he
said
i
don't
know
it
always
comes
when
i
immerse
any
living
thing
perhaps
he
continued
smiling
perhaps
it
is
the
vital
spark
of
the
creature
escaping
to
the
source
from
whence
it
came
i
saw
he
was
mocking
and
threatened
him
with
a
mahl-stick
but
he
only
laughed
and
changed
the
subject
stay
to
lunch
geneviã¨ve
will
be
here
directly
i
saw
her
going
to
early
mass
i
said
and
she
looked
as
fresh
and
sweet
as
that
lily--before
you
destroyed
it
do
you
think
i
destroyed
it
said
boris
gravely
destroyed
preserved
how
can
we
tell
we
sat
in
the
corner
of
a
studio
near
his
unfinished
group
of
the
fates
he
leaned
back
on
the
sofa
twirling
a
sculptor's
chisel
and
squinting
at
his
work
by
the
way
he
said
i
have
finished
pointing
up
that
old
academic
ariadne
and
i
suppose
it
will
have
to
go
to
the
salon
it's
all
i
have
ready
this
year
but
after
the
success
the
'madonna'
brought
me
i
feel
ashamed
to
send
a
thing
like
that
the
madonna
an
exquisite
marble
for
which
geneviã¨ve
had
sat
had
been
the
sensation
of
last
year's
salon
i
looked
at
the
ariadne
it
was
a
magnificent
piece
of
technical
work
but
i
agreed
with
boris
that
the
world
would
expect
something
better
of
him
than
that
still
it
was
impossible
now
to
think
of
finishing
in
time
for
the
salon
that
splendid
terrible
group
half
shrouded
in
the
marble
behind
me
the
fates
would
have
to
wait
we
were
proud
of
boris
yvain
we
claimed
him
and
he
claimed
us
on
the
strength
of
his
having
been
born
in
america
although
his
father
was
french
and
his
mother
was
a
russian
every
one
in
the
beaux
arts
called
him
boris
and
yet
there
were
only
two
of
us
whom
he
addressed
in
the
same
familiar
way--jack
scott
and
myself
perhaps
my
being
in
love
with
geneviã¨ve
had
something
to
do
with
his
affection
for
me
not
that
it
had
ever
been
acknowledged
between
us
but
after
all
was
settled
and
she
had
told
me
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
it
was
boris
whom
she
loved
i
went
over
to
his
house
and
congratulated
him
the
perfect
cordiality
of
that
interview
did
not
deceive
either
of
us
i
always
believed
although
to
one
at
least
it
was
a
great
comfort
i
do
not
think
he
and
geneviã¨ve
ever
spoke
of
the
matter
together
but
boris
knew
geneviã¨ve
was
lovely
the
madonna-like
purity
of
her
face
might
have
been
inspired
by
the
sanctus
in
gounod's
mass
but
i
was
always
glad
when
she
changed
that
mood
for
what
we
called
her
april
manoeuvres
she
was
often
as
variable
as
an
april
day
in
the
morning
grave
dignified
and
sweet
at
noon
laughing
capricious
at
evening
whatever
one
least
expected
i
preferred
her
so
rather
than
in
that
madonna-like
tranquillity
which
stirred
the
depths
of
my
heart
i
was
dreaming
of
geneviã¨ve
when
he
spoke
again
what
do
you
think
of
my
discovery
alec
i
think
it
wonderful
i
shall
make
no
use
of
it
you
know
beyond
satisfying
my
own
curiosity
so
far
as
may
be
and
the
secret
will
die
with
me
it
would
be
rather
a
blow
to
sculpture
would
it
not
we
painters
lose
more
than
we
ever
gain
by
photography
boris
nodded
playing
with
the
edge
of
the
chisel
this
new
vicious
discovery
would
corrupt
the
world
of
art
no
i
shall
never
confide
the
secret
to
any
one
he
said
slowly
it
would
be
hard
to
find
any
one
less
informed
about
such
phenomena
than
myself
but
of
course
i
had
heard
of
mineral
springs
so
saturated
with
silica
that
the
leaves
and
twigs
which
fell
into
them
were
turned
to
stone
after
a
time
i
dimly
comprehended
the
process
how
the
silica
replaced
the
vegetable
matter
atom
by
atom
and
the
result
was
a
duplicate
of
the
object
in
stone
this
i
confess
had
never
interested
me
greatly
and
as
for
the
ancient
fossils
thus
produced
they
disgusted
me
boris
it
appeared
feeling
curiosity
instead
of
repugnance
had
investigated
the
subject
and
had
accidentally
stumbled
on
a
solution
which
attacking
the
immersed
object
with
a
ferocity
unheard
of
in
a
second
did
the
work
of
years
this
was
all
i
could
make
out
of
the
strange
story
he
had
just
been
telling
me
he
spoke
again
after
a
long
silence
i
am
almost
frightened
when
i
think
what
i
have
found
scientists
would
go
mad
over
the
discovery
it
was
so
simple
too
it
discovered
itself
when
i
think
of
that
formula
and
that
new
element
precipitated
in
metallic
scales--
what
new
element
oh
i
haven't
thought
of
naming
it
and
i
don't
believe
i
ever
shall
there
are
enough
precious
metals
now
in
the
world
to
cut
throats
over
i
pricked
up
my
ears
have
you
struck
gold
boris
no
better--but
see
here
alec
he
laughed
starting
up
you
and
i
have
all
we
need
in
this
world
ah
how
sinister
and
covetous
you
look
already
i
laughed
too
and
told
him
i
was
devoured
by
the
desire
for
gold
and
we
had
better
talk
of
something
else
so
when
geneviã¨ve
came
in
shortly
after
we
had
turned
our
backs
on
alchemy
geneviã¨ve
was
dressed
in
silvery
grey
from
head
to
foot
the
light
glinted
along
the
soft
curves
of
her
fair
hair
as
she
turned
her
cheek
to
boris
then
she
saw
me
and
returned
my
greeting
she
had
never
before
failed
to
blow
me
a
kiss
from
the
tips
of
her
white
fingers
and
i
promptly
complained
of
the
omission
she
smiled
and
held
out
her
hand
which
dropped
almost
before
it
had
touched
mine
then
she
said
looking
at
boris--
you
must
ask
alec
to
stay
for
luncheon
this
also
was
something
new
she
had
always
asked
me
herself
until
to-day
i
did
said
boris
shortly
and
you
said
yes
i
hope
she
turned
to
me
with
a
charming
conventional
smile
i
might
have
been
an
acquaintance
of
the
day
before
yesterday
i
made
her
a
low
bow
j'avais
bien
l'honneur
madame
but
refusing
to
take
up
our
usual
bantering
tone
she
murmured
a
hospitable
commonplace
and
disappeared
boris
and
i
looked
at
one
another
i
had
better
go
home
don't
you
think
i
asked
hanged
if
i
know
he
replied
frankly
while
we
were
discussing
the
advisability
of
my
departure
geneviã¨ve
reappeared
in
the
doorway
without
her
bonnet
she
was
wonderfully
beautiful
but
her
colour
was
too
deep
and
her
lovely
eyes
were
too
bright
she
came
straight
up
to
me
and
took
my
arm
luncheon
is
ready
was
i
cross
alec
i
thought
i
had
a
headache
but
i
haven't
come
here
boris
and
she
slipped
her
other
arm
through
his
alec
knows
that
after
you
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
whom
i
like
as
well
as
i
like
him
so
if
he
sometimes
feels
snubbed
it
won't
hurt
him
ã
la
bonheur
i
cried
who
says
there
are
no
thunderstorms
in
april
are
you
ready
chanted
boris
aye
ready
and
arm-in-arm
we
raced
into
the
dining-room
scandalizing
the
servants
after
all
we
were
not
so
much
to
blame
geneviã¨ve
was
eighteen
boris
was
twenty-three
and
i
not
quite
twenty-one
ii
some
work
that
i
was
doing
about
this
time
on
the
decorations
for
geneviã¨ve's
boudoir
kept
me
constantly
at
the
quaint
little
hotel
in
the
rue
sainte-cã©cile
boris
and
i
in
those
days
laboured
hard
but
as
we
pleased
which
was
fitfully
and
we
all
three
with
jack
scott
idled
a
great
deal
together
one
quiet
afternoon
i
had
been
wandering
alone
over
the
house
examining
curios
prying
into
odd
corners
bringing
out
sweetmeats
and
cigars
from
strange
hiding-places
and
at
last
i
stopped
in
the
bathing-room
boris
all
over
clay
stood
there
washing
his
hands
the
room
was
built
of
rose-coloured
marble
excepting
the
floor
which
was
tessellated
in
rose
and
grey
in
the
centre
was
a
square
pool
sunken
below
the
surface
of
the
floor
steps
led
down
into
it
sculptured
pillars
supported
a
frescoed
ceiling
a
delicious
marble
cupid
appeared
to
have
just
alighted
on
his
pedestal
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
the
whole
interior
was
boris'
work
and
mine
boris
in
his
working-clothes
of
white
canvas
scraped
the
traces
of
clay
and
red
modelling
wax
from
his
handsome
hands
and
coquetted
over
his
shoulder
with
the
cupid
i
see
you
he
insisted
don't
try
to
look
the
other
way
and
pretend
not
to
see
me
you
know
who
made
you
little
humbug
it
was
always
my
rã´le
to
interpret
cupid's
sentiments
in
these
conversations
and
when
my
turn
came
i
responded
in
such
a
manner
that
boris
seized
my
arm
and
dragged
me
toward
the
pool
declaring
he
would
duck
me
next
instant
he
dropped
my
arm
and
turned
pale
good
god
he
said
i
forgot
the
pool
is
full
of
the
solution
i
shivered
a
little
and
dryly
advised
him
to
remember
better
where
he
had
stored
the
precious
liquid
in
heaven's
name
why
do
you
keep
a
small
lake
of
that
gruesome
stuff
here
of
all
places
i
asked
i
want
to
experiment
on
something
large
he
replied
on
me
for
instance
ah
that
came
too
close
for
jesting
but
i
do
want
to
watch
the
action
of
that
solution
on
a
more
highly
organized
living
body
there
is
that
big
white
rabbit
he
said
following
me
into
the
studio
jack
scott
wearing
a
paint-stained
jacket
came
wandering
in
appropriated
all
the
oriental
sweetmeats
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
looted
the
cigarette
case
and
finally
he
and
boris
disappeared
together
to
visit
the
luxembourg
gallery
where
a
new
silver
bronze
by
rodin
and
a
landscape
of
monet's
were
claiming
the
exclusive
attention
of
artistic
france
i
went
back
to
the
studio
and
resumed
my
work
it
was
a
renaissance
screen
which
boris
wanted
me
to
paint
for
geneviã¨ve's
boudoir
but
the
small
boy
who
was
unwillingly
dawdling
through
a
series
of
poses
for
it
to-day
refused
all
bribes
to
be
good
he
never
rested
an
instant
in
the
same
position
and
inside
of
five
minutes
i
had
as
many
different
outlines
of
the
little
beggar
are
you
posing
or
are
you
executing
a
song
and
dance
my
friend
i
inquired
whichever
monsieur
pleases
he
replied
with
an
angelic
smile
of
course
i
dismissed
him
for
the
day
and
of
course
i
paid
him
for
the
full
time
that
being
the
way
we
spoil
our
models
after
the
young
imp
had
gone
i
made
a
few
perfunctory
daubs
at
my
work
but
was
so
thoroughly
out
of
humour
that
it
took
me
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
to
undo
the
damage
i
had
done
so
at
last
i
scraped
my
palette
stuck
my
brushes
in
a
bowl
of
black
soap
and
strolled
into
the
smoking-room
i
really
believe
that
excepting
geneviã¨ve's
apartments
no
room
in
the
house
was
so
free
from
the
perfume
of
tobacco
as
this
one
it
was
a
queer
chaos
of
odds
and
ends
hung
with
threadbare
tapestry
a
sweet-toned
old
spinet
in
good
repair
stood
by
the
window
there
were
stands
of
weapons
some
old
and
dull
others
bright
and
modern
festoons
of
indian
and
turkish
armour
over
the
mantel
two
or
three
good
pictures
and
a
pipe-rack
it
was
here
that
we
used
to
come
for
new
sensations
in
smoking
i
doubt
if
any
type
of
pipe
ever
existed
which
was
not
represented
in
that
rack
when
we
had
selected
one
we
immediately
carried
it
somewhere
else
and
smoked
it
for
the
place
was
on
the
whole
more
gloomy
and
less
inviting
than
any
in
the
house
but
this
afternoon
the
twilight
was
very
soothing
the
rugs
and
skins
on
the
floor
looked
brown
and
soft
and
drowsy
the
big
couch
was
piled
with
cushions--i
found
my
pipe
and
curled
up
there
for
an
unaccustomed
smoke
in
the
smoking-room
i
had
chosen
one
with
a
long
flexible
stem
and
lighting
it
fell
to
dreaming
after
a
while
it
went
out
but
i
did
not
stir
i
dreamed
on
and
presently
fell
asleep
i
awoke
to
the
saddest
music
i
had
ever
heard
the
room
was
quite
dark
i
had
no
idea
what
time
it
was
a
ray
of
moonlight
silvered
one
edge
of
the
old
spinet
and
the
polished
wood
seemed
to
exhale
the
sounds
as
perfume
floats
above
a
box
of
sandalwood
some
one
rose
in
the
darkness
and
came
away
weeping
quietly
and
i
was
fool
enough
to
cry
out
geneviã¨ve
she
dropped
at
my
voice
and
i
had
time
to
curse
myself
while
i
made
a
light
and
tried
to
raise
her
from
the
floor
she
shrank
away
with
a
murmur
of
pain
she
was
very
quiet
and
asked
for
boris
i
carried
her
to
the
divan
and
went
to
look
for
him
but
he
was
not
in
the
house
and
the
servants
were
gone
to
bed
perplexed
and
anxious
i
hurried
back
to
geneviã¨ve
she
lay
where
i
had
left
her
looking
very
white
i
can't
find
boris
nor
any
of
the
servants
i
said
i
know
she
answered
faintly
boris
has
gone
to
ept
with
mr
scott
i
did
not
remember
when
i
sent
you
for
him
just
now
but
he
can't
get
back
in
that
case
before
to-morrow
afternoon
and--are
you
hurt
did
i
frighten
you
into
falling
what
an
awful
fool
i
am
but
i
was
only
half
awake
boris
thought
you
had
gone
home
before
dinner
do
please
excuse
us
for
letting
you
stay
here
all
this
time
i
have
had
a
long
nap
i
laughed
so
sound
that
i
did
not
know
whether
i
was
still
asleep
or
not
when
i
found
myself
staring
at
a
figure
that
was
moving
toward
me
and
called
out
your
name
have
you
been
trying
the
old
spinet
you
must
have
played
very
softly
i
would
tell
a
thousand
more
lies
worse
than
that
one
to
see
the
look
of
relief
that
came
into
her
face
she
smiled
adorably
and
said
in
her
natural
voice
alec
i
tripped
on
that
wolf's
head
and
i
think
my
ankle
is
sprained
please
call
marie
and
then
go
home
i
did
as
she
bade
me
and
left
her
there
when
the
maid
came
in
iii
at
noon
next
day
when
i
called
i
found
boris
walking
restlessly
about
his
studio
geneviã¨ve
is
asleep
just
now
he
told
me
the
sprain
is
nothing
but
why
should
she
have
such
a
high
fever
the
doctor
can't
account
for
it
or
else
he
will
not
he
muttered
geneviã¨ve
has
a
fever
i
asked
i
should
say
so
and
has
actually
been
a
little
light-headed
at
intervals
all
night
the
idea
gay
little
geneviã¨ve
without
a
care
in
the
world--and
she
keeps
saying
her
heart's
broken
and
she
wants
to
die
my
own
heart
stood
still
boris
leaned
against
the
door
of
his
studio
looking
down
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
kind
keen
eyes
clouded
a
new
line
of
trouble
drawn
over
the
mouth's
good
mark
that
made
the
smile
the
maid
had
orders
to
summon
him
the
instant
geneviã¨ve
opened
her
eyes
we
waited
and
waited
and
boris
growing
restless
wandered
about
fussing
with
modelling
wax
and
red
clay
suddenly
he
started
for
the
next
room
come
and
see
my
rose-coloured
bath
full
of
death
he
cried
is
it
death
i
asked
to
humour
his
mood
you
are
not
prepared
to
call
it
life
i
suppose
he
answered
as
he
spoke
he
plucked
a
solitary
goldfish
squirming
and
twisting
out
of
its
globe
we'll
send
this
one
after
the
other--wherever
that
is
he
said
there
was
feverish
excitement
in
his
voice
a
dull
weight
of
fever
lay
on
my
limbs
and
on
my
brain
as
i
followed
him
to
the
fair
crystal
pool
with
its
pink-tinted
sides
and
he
dropped
the
creature
in
falling
its
scales
flashed
with
a
hot
orange
gleam
in
its
angry
twistings
and
contortions
the
moment
it
struck
the
liquid
it
became
rigid
and
sank
heavily
to
the
bottom
then
came
the
milky
foam
the
splendid
hues
radiating
on
the
surface
and
then
the
shaft
of
pure
serene
light
broke
through
from
seemingly
infinite
depths
boris
plunged
in
his
hand
and
drew
out
an
exquisite
marble
thing
blue-veined
rose-tinted
and
glistening
with
opalescent
drops
child's
play
he
muttered
and
looked
wearily
longingly
at
me--as
if
i
could
answer
such
questions
but
jack
scott
came
in
and
entered
into
the
game
as
he
called
it
with
ardour
nothing
would
do
but
to
try
the
experiment
on
the
white
rabbit
then
and
there
i
was
willing
that
boris
should
find
distraction
from
his
cares
but
i
hated
to
see
the
life
go
out
of
a
warm
living
creature
and
i
declined
to
be
present
picking
up
a
book
at
random
i
sat
down
in
the
studio
to
read
alas
i
had
found
the
king
in
yellow
after
a
few
moments
which
seemed
ages
i
was
putting
it
away
with
a
nervous
shudder
when
boris
and
jack
came
in
bringing
their
marble
rabbit
at
the
same
time
the
bell
rang
above
and
a
cry
came
from
the
sick-room
boris
was
gone
like
a
flash
and
the
next
moment
he
called
jack
run
for
the
doctor
bring
him
back
with
you
alec
come
here
i
went
and
stood
at
her
door
a
frightened
maid
came
out
in
haste
and
ran
away
to
fetch
some
remedy
geneviã¨ve
sitting
bolt
upright
with
crimson
cheeks
and
glittering
eyes
babbled
incessantly
and
resisted
boris'
gentle
restraint
he
called
me
to
help
at
my
first
touch
she
sighed
and
sank
back
closing
her
eyes
and
then--then--as
we
still
bent
above
her
she
opened
them
again
looked
straight
into
boris'
face--poor
fever-crazed
girl--and
told
her
secret
at
the
same
instant
our
three
lives
turned
into
new
channels
the
bond
that
held
us
so
long
together
snapped
for
ever
and
a
new
bond
was
forged
in
its
place
for
she
had
spoken
my
name
and
as
the
fever
tortured
her
her
heart
poured
out
its
load
of
hidden
sorrow
amazed
and
dumb
i
bowed
my
head
while
my
face
burned
like
a
live
coal
and
the
blood
surged
in
my
ears
stupefying
me
with
its
clamour
incapable
of
movement
incapable
of
speech
i
listened
to
her
feverish
words
in
an
agony
of
shame
and
sorrow
i
could
not
silence
her
i
could
not
look
at
boris
then
i
felt
an
arm
upon
my
shoulder
and
boris
turned
a
bloodless
face
to
mine
it
is
not
your
fault
alec
don't
grieve
so
if
she
loves
you--
but
he
could
not
finish
and
as
the
doctor
stepped
swiftly
into
the
room
saying--ah
the
fever
i
seized
jack
scott
and
hurried
him
to
the
street
saying
boris
would
rather
be
alone
we
crossed
the
street
to
our
own
apartments
and
that
night
seeing
i
was
going
to
be
ill
too
he
went
for
the
doctor
again
the
last
thing
i
recollect
with
any
distinctness
was
hearing
jack
say
for
heaven's
sake
doctor
what
ails
him
to
wear
a
face
like
that
and
i
thought
of
the
king
in
yellow
and
the
pallid
mask
i
was
very
ill
for
the
strain
of
two
years
which
i
had
endured
since
that
fatal
may
morning
when
geneviã¨ve
murmured
i
love
you
but
i
think
i
love
boris
best
told
on
me
at
last
i
had
never
imagined
that
it
could
become
more
than
i
could
endure
outwardly
tranquil
i
had
deceived
myself
although
the
inward
battle
raged
night
after
night
and
i
lying
alone
in
my
room
cursed
myself
for
rebellious
thoughts
unloyal
to
boris
and
unworthy
of
geneviã¨ve
the
morning
always
brought
relief
and
i
returned
to
geneviã¨ve
and
to
my
dear
boris
with
a
heart
washed
clean
by
the
tempests
of
the
night
never
in
word
or
deed
or
thought
while
with
them
had
i
betrayed
my
sorrow
even
to
myself
the
mask
of
self-deception
was
no
longer
a
mask
for
me
it
was
a
part
of
me
night
lifted
it
laying
bare
the
stifled
truth
below
but
there
was
no
one
to
see
except
myself
and
when
the
day
broke
the
mask
fell
back
again
of
its
own
accord
these
thoughts
passed
through
my
troubled
mind
as
i
lay
sick
but
they
were
hopelessly
entangled
with
visions
of
white
creatures
heavy
as
stone
crawling
about
in
boris'
basin--of
the
wolf's
head
on
the
rug
foaming
and
snapping
at
geneviã¨ve
who
lay
smiling
beside
it
i
thought
too
of
the
king
in
yellow
wrapped
in
the
fantastic
colours
of
his
tattered
mantle
and
that
bitter
cry
of
cassilda
not
upon
us
oh
king
not
upon
us
feverishly
i
struggled
to
put
it
from
me
but
i
saw
the
lake
of
hali
thin
and
blank
without
a
ripple
or
wind
to
stir
it
and
i
saw
the
towers
of
carcosa
behind
the
moon
aldebaran
the
hyades
alar
hastur
glided
through
the
cloud-rifts
which
fluttered
and
flapped
as
they
passed
like
the
scolloped
tatters
of
the
king
in
yellow
among
all
these
one
sane
thought
persisted
it
never
wavered
no
matter
what
else
was
going
on
in
my
disordered
mind
that
my
chief
reason
for
existing
was
to
meet
some
requirement
of
boris
and
geneviã¨ve
what
this
obligation
was
its
nature
was
never
clear
sometimes
it
seemed
to
be
protection
sometimes
support
through
a
great
crisis
whatever
it
seemed
to
be
for
the
time
its
weight
rested
only
on
me
and
i
was
never
so
ill
or
so
weak
that
i
did
not
respond
with
my
whole
soul
there
were
always
crowds
of
faces
about
me
mostly
strange
but
a
few
i
recognized
boris
among
them
afterward
they
told
me
that
this
could
not
have
been
but
i
know
that
once
at
least
he
bent
over
me
it
was
only
a
touch
a
faint
echo
of
his
voice
then
the
clouds
settled
back
on
my
senses
and
i
lost
him
but
he
did
stand
there
and
bend
over
me
once
at
least
at
last
one
morning
i
awoke
to
find
the
sunlight
falling
across
my
bed
and
jack
scott
reading
beside
me
i
had
not
strength
enough
to
speak
aloud
neither
could
i
think
much
less
remember
but
i
could
smile
feebly
as
jack's
eye
met
mine
and
when
he
jumped
up
and
asked
eagerly
if
i
wanted
anything
i
could
whisper
yes--boris
jack
moved
to
the
head
of
my
bed
and
leaned
down
to
arrange
my
pillow
i
did
not
see
his
face
but
he
answered
heartily
you
must
wait
alec
you
are
too
weak
to
see
even
boris
i
waited
and
i
grew
strong
in
a
few
days
i
was
able
to
see
whom
i
would
but
meanwhile
i
had
thought
and
remembered
from
the
moment
when
all
the
past
grew
clear
again
in
my
mind
i
never
doubted
what
i
should
do
when
the
time
came
and
i
felt
sure
that
boris
would
have
resolved
upon
the
same
course
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
as
for
what
pertained
to
me
alone
i
knew
he
would
see
that
also
as
i
did
i
no
longer
asked
for
any
one
i
never
inquired
why
no
message
came
from
them
why
during
the
week
i
lay
there
waiting
and
growing
stronger
i
never
heard
their
name
spoken
preoccupied
with
my
own
searchings
for
the
right
way
and
with
my
feeble
but
determined
fight
against
despair
i
simply
acquiesced
in
jack's
reticence
taking
for
granted
that
he
was
afraid
to
speak
of
them
lest
i
should
turn
unruly
and
insist
on
seeing
them
meanwhile
i
said
over
and
over
to
myself
how
would
it
be
when
life
began
again
for
us
all
we
would
take
up
our
relations
exactly
as
they
were
before
geneviã¨ve
fell
ill
boris
and
i
would
look
into
each
other's
eyes
and
there
would
be
neither
rancour
nor
cowardice
nor
mistrust
in
that
glance
i
would
be
with
them
again
for
a
little
while
in
the
dear
intimacy
of
their
home
and
then
without
pretext
or
explanation
i
would
disappear
from
their
lives
for
ever
boris
would
know
geneviã¨ve--the
only
comfort
was
that
she
would
never
know
it
seemed
as
i
thought
it
over
that
i
had
found
the
meaning
of
that
sense
of
obligation
which
had
persisted
all
through
my
delirium
and
the
only
possible
answer
to
it
so
when
i
was
quite
ready
i
beckoned
jack
to
me
one
day
and
said--
jack
i
want
boris
at
once
and
take
my
dearest
greeting
to
geneviã¨ve
when
at
last
he
made
me
understand
that
they
were
both
dead
i
fell
into
a
wild
rage
that
tore
all
my
little
convalescent
strength
to
atoms
i
raved
and
cursed
myself
into
a
relapse
from
which
i
crawled
forth
some
weeks
afterward
a
boy
of
twenty-one
who
believed
that
his
youth
was
gone
for
ever
i
seemed
to
be
past
the
capability
of
further
suffering
and
one
day
when
jack
handed
me
a
letter
and
the
keys
to
boris'
house
i
took
them
without
a
tremor
and
asked
him
to
tell
me
all
it
was
cruel
of
me
to
ask
him
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
he
leaned
wearily
on
his
thin
hands
to
reopen
the
wound
which
could
never
entirely
heal
he
began
very
quietly--
alec
unless
you
have
a
clue
that
i
know
nothing
about
you
will
not
be
able
to
explain
any
more
than
i
what
has
happened
i
suspect
that
you
would
rather
not
hear
these
details
but
you
must
learn
them
else
i
would
spare
you
the
relation
god
knows
i
wish
i
could
be
spared
the
telling
i
shall
use
few
words
that
day
when
i
left
you
in
the
doctor's
care
and
came
back
to
boris
i
found
him
working
on
the
'fates'
geneviã¨ve
he
said
was
sleeping
under
the
influence
of
drugs
she
had
been
quite
out
of
her
mind
he
said
he
kept
on
working
not
talking
any
more
and
i
watched
him
before
long
i
saw
that
the
third
figure
of
the
group--the
one
looking
straight
ahead
out
over
the
world--bore
his
face
not
as
you
ever
saw
it
but
as
it
looked
then
and
to
the
end
this
is
one
thing
for
which
i
should
like
to
find
an
explanation
but
i
never
shall
well
he
worked
and
i
watched
him
in
silence
and
we
went
on
that
way
until
nearly
midnight
then
we
heard
the
door
open
and
shut
sharply
and
a
swift
rush
in
the
next
room
boris
sprang
through
the
doorway
and
i
followed
but
we
were
too
late
she
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
pool
her
hands
across
her
breast
then
boris
shot
himself
through
the
heart
jack
stopped
speaking
drops
of
sweat
stood
under
his
eyes
and
his
thin
cheeks
twitched
i
carried
boris
to
his
room
then
i
went
back
and
let
that
hellish
fluid
out
of
the
pool
and
turning
on
all
the
water
washed
the
marble
clean
of
every
drop
when
at
length
i
dared
descend
the
steps
i
found
her
lying
there
as
white
as
snow
at
last
when
i
had
decided
what
was
best
to
do
i
went
into
the
laboratory
and
first
emptied
the
solution
in
the
basin
into
the
waste-pipe
then
i
poured
the
contents
of
every
jar
and
bottle
after
it
there
was
wood
in
the
fire-place
so
i
built
a
fire
and
breaking
the
locks
of
boris'
cabinet
i
burnt
every
paper
notebook
and
letter
that
i
found
there
with
a
mallet
from
the
studio
i
smashed
to
pieces
all
the
empty
bottles
then
loading
them
into
a
coal-scuttle
i
carried
them
to
the
cellar
and
threw
them
over
the
red-hot
bed
of
the
furnace
six
times
i
made
the
journey
and
at
last
not
a
vestige
remained
of
anything
which
might
again
aid
in
seeking
for
the
formula
which
boris
had
found
then
at
last
i
dared
call
the
doctor
he
is
a
good
man
and
together
we
struggled
to
keep
it
from
the
public
without
him
i
never
could
have
succeeded
at
last
we
got
the
servants
paid
and
sent
away
into
the
country
where
old
rosier
keeps
them
quiet
with
stones
of
boris'
and
geneviã¨ve's
travels
in
distant
lands
from
whence
they
will
not
return
for
years
we
buried
boris
in
the
little
cemetery
of
sã¨vres
the
doctor
is
a
good
creature
and
knows
when
to
pity
a
man
who
can
bear
no
more
he
gave
his
certificate
of
heart
disease
and
asked
no
questions
of
me
then
lifting
his
head
from
his
hands
he
said
open
the
letter
alec
it
is
for
us
both
i
tore
it
open
it
was
boris'
will
dated
a
year
before
he
left
everything
to
geneviã¨ve
and
in
case
of
her
dying
childless
i
was
to
take
control
of
the
house
in
the
rue
sainte-cã©cile
and
jack
scott
the
management
at
ept
on
our
deaths
the
property
reverted
to
his
mother's
family
in
russia
with
the
exception
of
the
sculptured
marbles
executed
by
himself
these
he
left
to
me
the
page
blurred
under
our
eyes
and
jack
got
up
and
walked
to
the
window
presently
he
returned
and
sat
down
again
i
dreaded
to
hear
what
he
was
going
to
say
but
he
spoke
with
the
same
simplicity
and
gentleness
geneviã¨ve
lies
before
the
madonna
in
the
marble
room
the
madonna
bends
tenderly
above
her
and
geneviã¨ve
smiles
back
into
that
calm
face
that
never
would
have
been
except
for
her
his
voice
broke
but
he
grasped
my
hand
saying
courage
alec
next
morning
he
left
for
ept
to
fulfil
his
trust
iv
the
same
evening
i
took
the
keys
and
went
into
the
house
i
had
known
so
well
everything
was
in
order
but
the
silence
was
terrible
though
i
went
twice
to
the
door
of
the
marble
room
i
could
not
force
myself
to
enter
it
was
beyond
my
strength
i
went
into
the
smoking-room
and
sat
down
before
the
spinet
a
small
lace
handkerchief
lay
on
the
keys
and
i
turned
away
choking
it
was
plain
i
could
not
stay
so
i
locked
every
door
every
window
and
the
three
front
and
back
gates
and
went
away
next
morning
alcide
packed
my
valise
and
leaving
him
in
charge
of
my
apartments
i
took
the
orient
express
for
constantinople
during
the
two
years
that
i
wandered
through
the
east
at
first
in
our
letters
we
never
mentioned
geneviã¨ve
and
boris
but
gradually
their
names
crept
in
i
recollect
particularly
a
passage
in
one
of
jack's
letters
replying
to
one
of
mine--
what
you
tell
me
of
seeing
boris
bending
over
you
while
you
lay
ill
and
feeling
his
touch
on
your
face
and
hearing
his
voice
of
course
troubles
me
this
that
you
describe
must
have
happened
a
fortnight
after
he
died
i
say
to
myself
that
you
were
dreaming
that
it
was
part
of
your
delirium
but
the
explanation
does
not
satisfy
me
nor
would
it
you
toward
the
end
of
the
second
year
a
letter
came
from
jack
to
me
in
india
so
unlike
anything
that
i
had
ever
known
of
him
that
i
decided
to
return
at
once
to
paris
he
wrote
i
am
well
and
sell
all
my
pictures
as
artists
do
who
have
no
need
of
money
i
have
not
a
care
of
my
own
but
i
am
more
restless
than
if
i
had
i
am
unable
to
shake
off
a
strange
anxiety
about
you
it
is
not
apprehension
it
is
rather
a
breathless
expectancy--of
what
god
knows
i
can
only
say
it
is
wearing
me
out
nights
i
dream
always
of
you
and
boris
i
can
never
recall
anything
afterward
but
i
wake
in
the
morning
with
my
heart
beating
and
all
day
the
excitement
increases
until
i
fall
asleep
at
night
to
recall
the
same
experience
i
am
quite
exhausted
by
it
and
have
determined
to
break
up
this
morbid
condition
i
must
see
you
shall
i
go
to
bombay
or
will
you
come
to
paris
i
telegraphed
him
to
expect
me
by
the
next
steamer
when
we
met
i
thought
he
had
changed
very
little
i
he
insisted
looked
in
splendid
health
it
was
good
to
hear
his
voice
again
and
as
we
sat
and
chatted
about
what
life
still
held
for
us
we
felt
that
it
was
pleasant
to
be
alive
in
the
bright
spring
weather
we
stayed
in
paris
together
a
week
and
then
i
went
for
a
week
to
ept
with
him
but
first
of
all
we
went
to
the
cemetery
at
sã¨vres
where
boris
lay
shall
we
place
the
'fates'
in
the
little
grove
above
him
jack
asked
and
i
answered--
i
think
only
the
'madonna'
should
watch
over
boris'
grave
but
jack
was
none
the
better
for
my
home-coming
the
dreams
of
which
he
could
not
retain
even
the
least
definite
outline
continued
and
he
said
that
at
times
the
sense
of
breathless
expectancy
was
suffocating
you
see
i
do
you
harm
and
not
good
i
said
try
a
change
without
me
so
he
started
alone
for
a
ramble
among
the
channel
islands
and
i
went
back
to
paris
i
had
not
yet
entered
boris'
house
now
mine
since
my
return
but
i
knew
it
must
be
done
it
had
been
kept
in
order
by
jack
there
were
servants
there
so
i
gave
up
my
own
apartment
and
went
there
to
live
instead
of
the
agitation
i
had
feared
i
found
myself
able
to
paint
there
tranquilly
i
visited
all
the
rooms--all
but
one
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
enter
the
marble
room
where
geneviã¨ve
lay
and
yet
i
felt
the
longing
growing
daily
to
look
upon
her
face
to
kneel
beside
her
one
april
afternoon
i
lay
dreaming
in
the
smoking-room
just
as
i
had
lain
two
years
before
and
mechanically
i
looked
among
the
tawny
eastern
rugs
for
the
wolf-skin
at
last
i
distinguished
the
pointed
ears
and
flat
cruel
head
and
i
thought
of
my
dream
where
i
saw
geneviã¨ve
lying
beside
it
the
helmets
still
hung
against
the
threadbare
tapestry
among
them
the
old
spanish
morion
which
i
remembered
geneviã¨ve
had
once
put
on
when
we
were
amusing
ourselves
with
the
ancient
bits
of
mail
i
turned
my
eyes
to
the
spinet
every
yellow
key
seemed
eloquent
of
her
caressing
hand
and
i
rose
drawn
by
the
strength
of
my
life's
passion
to
the
sealed
door
of
the
marble
room
the
heavy
doors
swung
inward
under
my
trembling
hands
sunlight
poured
through
the
window
tipping
with
gold
the
wings
of
cupid
and
lingered
like
a
nimbus
over
the
brows
of
the
madonna
her
tender
face
bent
in
compassion
over
a
marble
form
so
exquisitely
pure
that
i
knelt
and
signed
myself
geneviã¨ve
lay
in
the
shadow
under
the
madonna
and
yet
through
her
white
arms
i
saw
the
pale
azure
vein
and
beneath
her
softly
clasped
hands
the
folds
of
her
dress
were
tinged
with
rose
as
if
from
some
faint
warm
light
within
her
breast
bending
with
a
breaking
heart
i
touched
the
marble
drapery
with
my
lips
then
crept
back
into
the
silent
house
a
maid
came
and
brought
me
a
letter
and
i
sat
down
in
the
little
conservatory
to
read
it
but
as
i
was
about
to
break
the
seal
seeing
the
girl
lingering
i
asked
her
what
she
wanted
she
stammered
something
about
a
white
rabbit
that
had
been
caught
in
the
house
and
asked
what
should
be
done
with
it
i
told
her
to
let
it
loose
in
the
walled
garden
behind
the
house
and
opened
my
letter
it
was
from
jack
but
so
incoherent
that
i
thought
he
must
have
lost
his
reason
it
was
nothing
but
a
series
of
prayers
to
me
not
to
leave
the
house
until
he
could
get
back
he
could
not
tell
me
why
there
were
the
dreams
he
said--he
could
explain
nothing
but
he
was
sure
that
i
must
not
leave
the
house
in
the
rue
sainte-cã©cile
as
i
finished
reading
i
raised
my
eyes
and
saw
the
same
maid-servant
standing
in
the
doorway
holding
a
glass
dish
in
which
two
gold-fish
were
swimming
put
them
back
into
the
tank
and
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
interrupting
me
i
said
with
a
half-suppressed
whimper
she
emptied
water
and
fish
into
an
aquarium
at
the
end
of
the
conservatory
and
turning
to
me
asked
my
permission
to
leave
my
service
she
said
people
were
playing
tricks
on
her
evidently
with
a
design
of
getting
her
into
trouble
the
marble
rabbit
had
been
stolen
and
a
live
one
had
been
brought
into
the
house
the
two
beautiful
marble
fish
were
gone
and
she
had
just
found
those
common
live
things
flopping
on
the
dining-room
floor
i
reassured
her
and
sent
her
away
saying
i
would
look
about
myself
i
went
into
the
studio
there
was
nothing
there
but
my
canvases
and
some
casts
except
the
marble
of
the
easter
lily
i
saw
it
on
a
table
across
the
room
then
i
strode
angrily
over
to
it
but
the
flower
i
lifted
from
the
table
was
fresh
and
fragile
and
filled
the
air
with
perfume
then
suddenly
i
comprehended
and
sprang
through
the
hall-way
to
the
marble
room
the
doors
flew
open
the
sunlight
streamed
into
my
face
and
through
it
in
a
heavenly
glory
the
madonna
smiled
as
geneviã¨ve
lifted
her
flushed
face
from
her
marble
couch
and
opened
her
sleepy
eyes
in
the
court
of
the
dragon
oh
thou
who
burn'st
in
heart
for
those
who
burn
in
hell
whose
fires
thyself
shall
feed
in
turn
how
long
be
crying--'mercy
on
them'
god
why
who
art
thou
to
teach
and
he
to
learn
in
the
church
of
st
barnabã©
vespers
were
over
the
clergy
left
the
altar
the
little
choir-boys
flocked
across
the
chancel
and
settled
in
the
stalls
a
suisse
in
rich
uniform
marched
down
the
south
aisle
sounding
his
staff
at
every
fourth
step
on
the
stone
pavement
behind
him
came
that
eloquent
preacher
and
good
man
monseigneur
c----
my
chair
was
near
the
chancel
rail
i
now
turned
toward
the
west
end
of
the
church
the
other
people
between
the
altar
and
the
pulpit
turned
too
there
was
a
little
scraping
and
rustling
while
the
congregation
seated
itself
again
the
preacher
mounted
the
pulpit
stairs
and
the
organ
voluntary
ceased
i
had
always
found
the
organ-playing
at
st
barnabã©
highly
interesting
learned
and
scientific
it
was
too
much
so
for
my
small
knowledge
but
expressing
a
vivid
if
cold
intelligence
moreover
it
possessed
the
french
quality
of
taste
taste
reigned
supreme
self-controlled
dignified
and
reticent
to-day
however
from
the
first
chord
i
had
felt
a
change
for
the
worse
a
sinister
change
during
vespers
it
had
been
chiefly
the
chancel
organ
which
supported
the
beautiful
choir
but
now
and
again
quite
wantonly
as
it
seemed
from
the
west
gallery
where
the
great
organ
stands
a
heavy
hand
had
struck
across
the
church
at
the
serene
peace
of
those
clear
voices
it
was
something
more
than
harsh
and
dissonant
and
it
betrayed
no
lack
of
skill
as
it
recurred
again
and
again
it
set
me
thinking
of
what
my
architect's
books
say
about
the
custom
in
early
times
to
consecrate
the
choir
as
soon
as
it
was
built
and
that
the
nave
being
finished
sometimes
half
a
century
later
often
did
not
get
any
blessing
at
all
i
wondered
idly
if
that
had
been
the
case
at
st
barnabã©
and
whether
something
not
usually
supposed
to
be
at
home
in
a
christian
church
might
have
entered
undetected
and
taken
possession
of
the
west
gallery
i
had
read
of
such
things
happening
too
but
not
in
works
on
architecture
then
i
remembered
that
st
barnabã©
was
not
much
more
than
a
hundred
years
old
and
smiled
at
the
incongruous
association
of
mediaeval
superstitions
with
that
cheerful
little
piece
of
eighteenth-century
rococo
but
now
vespers
were
over
and
there
should
have
followed
a
few
quiet
chords
fit
to
accompany
meditation
while
we
waited
for
the
sermon
instead
of
that
the
discord
at
the
lower
end
of
the
church
broke
out
with
the
departure
of
the
clergy
as
if
now
nothing
could
control
it
i
belong
to
those
children
of
an
older
and
simpler
generation
who
do
not
love
to
seek
for
psychological
subtleties
in
art
and
i
have
ever
refused
to
find
in
music
anything
more
than
melody
and
harmony
but
i
felt
that
in
the
labyrinth
of
sounds
now
issuing
from
that
instrument
there
was
something
being
hunted
up
and
down
the
pedals
chased
him
while
the
manuals
blared
approval
poor
devil
whoever
he
was
there
seemed
small
hope
of
escape
my
nervous
annoyance
changed
to
anger
who
was
doing
this
how
dare
he
play
like
that
in
the
midst
of
divine
service
i
glanced
at
the
people
near
me
not
one
appeared
to
be
in
the
least
disturbed
the
placid
brows
of
the
kneeling
nuns
still
turned
towards
the
altar
lost
none
of
their
devout
abstraction
under
the
pale
shadow
of
their
white
head-dress
the
fashionable
lady
beside
me
was
looking
expectantly
at
monseigneur
c----
for
all
her
face
betrayed
the
organ
might
have
been
singing
an
ave
maria
but
now
at
last
the
preacher
had
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
commanded
silence
i
turned
to
him
gladly
thus
far
i
had
not
found
the
rest
i
had
counted
on
when
i
entered
st
barnabã©
that
afternoon
i
was
worn
out
by
three
nights
of
physical
suffering
and
mental
trouble
the
last
had
been
the
worst
and
it
was
an
exhausted
body
and
a
mind
benumbed
and
yet
acutely
sensitive
which
i
had
brought
to
my
favourite
church
for
healing
for
i
had
been
reading
the
king
in
yellow
the
sun
ariseth
they
gather
themselves
together
and
lay
them
down
in
their
dens
monseigneur
c----
delivered
his
text
in
a
calm
voice
glancing
quietly
over
the
congregation
my
eyes
turned
i
knew
not
why
toward
the
lower
end
of
the
church
the
organist
was
coming
from
behind
his
pipes
and
passing
along
the
gallery
on
his
way
out
i
saw
him
disappear
by
a
small
door
that
leads
to
some
stairs
which
descend
directly
to
the
street
he
was
a
slender
man
and
his
face
was
as
white
as
his
coat
was
black
good
riddance
i
thought
with
your
wicked
music
i
hope
your
assistant
will
play
the
closing
voluntary
with
a
feeling
of
relief--with
a
deep
calm
feeling
of
relief
i
turned
back
to
the
mild
face
in
the
pulpit
and
settled
myself
to
listen
here
at
last
was
the
ease
of
mind
i
longed
for
my
children
said
the
preacher
one
truth
the
human
soul
finds
hardest
of
all
to
learn
that
it
has
nothing
to
fear
it
can
never
be
made
to
see
that
nothing
can
really
harm
it
curious
doctrine
i
thought
for
a
catholic
priest
let
us
see
how
he
will
reconcile
that
with
the
fathers
nothing
can
really
harm
the
soul
he
went
on
in
his
coolest
clearest
tones
because----
but
i
never
heard
the
rest
my
eye
left
his
face
i
knew
not
for
what
reason
and
sought
the
lower
end
of
the
church
the
same
man
was
coming
out
from
behind
the
organ
and
was
passing
along
the
gallery
the
same
way
but
there
had
not
been
time
for
him
to
return
and
if
he
had
returned
i
must
have
seen
him
i
felt
a
faint
chill
and
my
heart
sank
and
yet
his
going
and
coming
were
no
affair
of
mine
i
looked
at
him
i
could
not
look
away
from
his
black
figure
and
his
white
face
when
he
was
exactly
opposite
to
me
he
turned
and
sent
across
the
church
straight
into
my
eyes
a
look
of
hate
intense
and
deadly
i
have
never
seen
any
other
like
it
would
to
god
i
might
never
see
it
again
then
he
disappeared
by
the
same
door
through
which
i
had
watched
him
depart
less
than
sixty
seconds
before
i
sat
and
tried
to
collect
my
thoughts
my
first
sensation
was
like
that
of
a
very
young
child
badly
hurt
when
it
catches
its
breath
before
crying
out
to
suddenly
find
myself
the
object
of
such
hatred
was
exquisitely
painful
and
this
man
was
an
utter
stranger
why
should
he
hate
me
so--me
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
for
the
moment
all
other
sensation
was
merged
in
this
one
pang
even
fear
was
subordinate
to
grief
and
for
that
moment
i
never
doubted
but
in
the
next
i
began
to
reason
and
a
sense
of
the
incongruous
came
to
my
aid
as
i
have
said
st
barnabã©
is
a
modern
church
it
is
small
and
well
lighted
one
sees
all
over
it
almost
at
a
glance
the
organ
gallery
gets
a
strong
white
light
from
a
row
of
long
windows
in
the
clerestory
which
have
not
even
coloured
glass
the
pulpit
being
in
the
middle
of
the
church
it
followed
that
when
i
was
turned
toward
it
whatever
moved
at
the
west
end
could
not
fail
to
attract
my
eye
when
the
organist
passed
it
was
no
wonder
that
i
saw
him
i
had
simply
miscalculated
the
interval
between
his
first
and
his
second
passing
he
had
come
in
that
last
time
by
the
other
side-door
as
for
the
look
which
had
so
upset
me
there
had
been
no
such
thing
and
i
was
a
nervous
fool
i
looked
about
this
was
a
likely
place
to
harbour
supernatural
horrors
that
clear-cut
reasonable
face
of
monseigneur
c----
his
collected
manner
and
easy
graceful
gestures
were
they
not
just
a
little
discouraging
to
the
notion
of
a
gruesome
mystery
i
glanced
above
his
head
and
almost
laughed
that
flyaway
lady
supporting
one
corner
of
the
pulpit
canopy
which
looked
like
a
fringed
damask
table-cloth
in
a
high
wind
at
the
first
attempt
of
a
basilisk
to
pose
up
there
in
the
organ
loft
she
would
point
her
gold
trumpet
at
him
and
puff
him
out
of
existence
i
laughed
to
myself
over
this
conceit
which
at
the
time
i
thought
very
amusing
and
sat
and
chaffed
myself
and
everything
else
from
the
old
harpy
outside
the
railing
who
had
made
me
pay
ten
centimes
for
my
chair
before
she
would
let
me
in
she
was
more
like
a
basilisk
i
told
myself
than
was
my
organist
with
the
anaemic
complexion
from
that
grim
old
dame
to
yes
alas
monseigneur
c----
himself
for
all
devoutness
had
fled
i
had
never
yet
done
such
a
thing
in
my
life
but
now
i
felt
a
desire
to
mock
as
for
the
sermon
i
could
not
hear
a
word
of
it
for
the
jingle
in
my
ears
of
the
skirts
of
st
paul
has
reached
having
preached
us
those
six
lent
lectures
more
unctuous
than
ever
he
preached
keeping
time
to
the
most
fantastic
and
irreverent
thoughts
it
was
no
use
to
sit
there
any
longer
i
must
get
out
of
doors
and
shake
myself
free
from
this
hateful
mood
i
knew
the
rudeness
i
was
committing
but
still
i
rose
and
left
the
church
a
spring
sun
was
shining
on
the
rue
st
honorã©
as
i
ran
down
the
church
steps
on
one
corner
stood
a
barrow
full
of
yellow
jonquils
pale
violets
from
the
riviera
dark
russian
violets
and
white
roman
hyacinths
in
a
golden
cloud
of
mimosa
the
street
was
full
of
sunday
pleasure-seekers
i
swung
my
cane
and
laughed
with
the
rest
some
one
overtook
and
passed
me
he
never
turned
but
there
was
the
same
deadly
malignity
in
his
white
profile
that
there
had
been
in
his
eyes
i
watched
him
as
long
as
i
could
see
him
his
lithe
back
expressed
the
same
menace
every
step
that
carried
him
away
from
me
seemed
to
bear
him
on
some
errand
connected
with
my
destruction
i
was
creeping
along
my
feet
almost
refusing
to
move
there
began
to
dawn
in
me
a
sense
of
responsibility
for
something
long
forgotten
it
began
to
seem
as
if
i
deserved
that
which
he
threatened
it
reached
a
long
way
back--a
long
long
way
back
it
had
lain
dormant
all
these
years
it
was
there
though
and
presently
it
would
rise
and
confront
me
but
i
would
try
to
escape
and
i
stumbled
as
best
i
could
into
the
rue
de
rivoli
across
the
place
de
la
concorde
and
on
to
the
quai
i
looked
with
sick
eyes
upon
the
sun
shining
through
the
white
foam
of
the
fountain
pouring
over
the
backs
of
the
dusky
bronze
river-gods
on
the
far-away
arc
a
structure
of
amethyst
mist
on
the
countless
vistas
of
grey
stems
and
bare
branches
faintly
green
then
i
saw
him
again
coming
down
one
of
the
chestnut
alleys
of
the
cours
la
reine
i
left
the
river-side
plunged
blindly
across
to
the
champs
elysã©es
and
turned
toward
the
arc
the
setting
sun
was
sending
its
rays
along
the
green
sward
of
the
rond-point
in
the
full
glow
he
sat
on
a
bench
children
and
young
mothers
all
about
him
he
was
nothing
but
a
sunday
lounger
like
the
others
like
myself
i
said
the
words
almost
aloud
and
all
the
while
i
gazed
on
the
malignant
hatred
of
his
face
but
he
was
not
looking
at
me
i
crept
past
and
dragged
my
leaden
feet
up
the
avenue
i
knew
that
every
time
i
met
him
brought
him
nearer
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
and
my
fate
and
still
i
tried
to
save
myself
the
last
rays
of
sunset
were
pouring
through
the
great
arc
i
passed
under
it
and
met
him
face
to
face
i
had
left
him
far
down
the
champs
elysã©es
and
yet
he
came
in
with
a
stream
of
people
who
were
returning
from
the
bois
de
boulogne
he
came
so
close
that
he
brushed
me
his
slender
frame
felt
like
iron
inside
its
loose
black
covering
he
showed
no
signs
of
haste
nor
of
fatigue
nor
of
any
human
feeling
his
whole
being
expressed
one
thing
the
will
and
the
power
to
work
me
evil
in
anguish
i
watched
him
where
he
went
down
the
broad
crowded
avenue
that
was
all
flashing
with
wheels
and
the
trappings
of
horses
and
the
helmets
of
the
garde
republicaine
he
was
soon
lost
to
sight
then
i
turned
and
fled
into
the
bois
and
far
out
beyond
it--i
know
not
where
i
went
but
after
a
long
while
as
it
seemed
to
me
night
had
fallen
and
i
found
myself
sitting
at
a
table
before
a
small
cafã©
i
had
wandered
back
into
the
bois
it
was
hours
now
since
i
had
seen
him
physical
fatigue
and
mental
suffering
had
left
me
no
power
to
think
or
feel
i
was
tired
so
tired
i
longed
to
hide
away
in
my
own
den
i
resolved
to
go
home
but
that
was
a
long
way
off
i
live
in
the
court
of
the
dragon
a
narrow
passage
that
leads
from
the
rue
de
rennes
to
the
rue
du
dragon
it
is
an
impasse
traversable
only
for
foot
passengers
over
the
entrance
on
the
rue
de
rennes
is
a
balcony
supported
by
an
iron
dragon
within
the
court
tall
old
houses
rise
on
either
side
and
close
the
ends
that
give
on
the
two
streets
huge
gates
swung
back
during
the
day
into
the
walls
of
the
deep
archways
close
this
court
after
midnight
and
one
must
enter
then
by
ringing
at
certain

the

pavement
collects

steep

that

the

floors

and
by

all

long
the
place
rings
with
the
clink
of
hammers
and
the
clang
of
metal
bars
unsavoury
as
it
is
below
there
is
cheerfulness
and
comfort
and
hard
honest
work
above
five
flights
up
are
the
ateliers
of
architects
and
painters
and
the
hiding-places
of
middle-aged
students
like
myself
who
want
to
live
alone
when
i
first
came
here
to
live
i
was
young
and
not
alone
i
had
to
walk
a
while
before
any
conveyance
appeared
but
at
last
when
i
had
almost
reached
the
arc
de
triomphe
again
an
empty
cab
came
along
and
i
took
it
from
the
arc
to
the
rue
de
rennes
is
a
drive
of
more
than
half
an
hour
especially
when
one
is
conveyed
by
a
tired
cab
horse
that
has
been
at
the
mercy
of
sunday
fete-makers
there
had
been
time
before
i
passed
under
the
dragon's
wings
to
meet
my
enemy
over
and
over
again
but
i
never
saw
him
once
and
now
refuge
was
close
at
hand
before
the
wide
gateway
a
small
mob
of
children
were
playing
our
concierge
and
his
wife
walked
among
them
with
their
black
poodle
keeping
order
some
couples
were
waltzing
on
the
side-walk
i
returned
their
greetings
and
hurried
in
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
court
had
trooped
out
into
the
street
the
place
was
quite
deserted
lighted
by
a
few
lanterns
hung
high
up
in
which
the
gas
burned
dimly
my
apartment
was
at
the
top
of
a
house
halfway
down
the
court
reached
by
a
staircase
that
descended
almost
into
the
street
with
only
a
bit
of
passage-way
intervening
i
set
my
foot
on
the
threshold
of
the
open
door
the
friendly
old
ruinous
stairs
rose
before
me
leading
up
to
rest
and
shelter
looking
back
over
my
right
shoulder
i
saw
him
ten
paces
off
he
must
have
entered
the
court
with
me
he
was
coming
straight
on
neither
slowly
nor
swiftly
but
straight
on
to
me
and
now
he
was
looking
at
me
for
the
first
time
since
our
eyes
encountered
across
the
church
they
met
now
again
and
i
knew
that
the
time
had
come
retreating
backward
down
the
court
i
faced
him
i
meant
to
escape
by
the
entrance
on
the
rue
du
dragon
his
eyes
told
me
that
i
never
should
escape
it
seemed
ages
while
we
were
going
i
retreating
he
advancing
down
the
court
in
perfect
silence
but
at
last
i
felt
the
shadow
of
the
archway
and
the
next
step
brought
me
within
it
i
had
meant
to
turn
here
and
spring
through
into
the
street
but
the
shadow
was
not
that
of
an
archway
it
was
that
of
a
vault
the
great
doors
on
the
rue
du
dragon
were
closed
i
felt
this
by
the
blackness
which
surrounded
me
and
at
the
same
instant
i
read
it
in
his
face
how
his
face
gleamed
in
the
darkness
drawing
swiftly
nearer
the
deep
vaults
the
huge
closed
doors
their
cold
iron
clamps
were
all
on
his
side
the
thing
which
he
had
threatened
had
arrived
it
gathered
and
bore
down
on
me
from
the
fathomless
shadows
the
point
from
which
it
would
strike
was
his
infernal
eyes
hopeless
i
set
my
back
against
the
barred
doors
and
defied
him
there
was
a
scraping
of
chairs
on
the
stone
floor
and
a
rustling
as
the
congregation
rose
i
could
hear
the
suisse's
staff
in
the
south
aisle
preceding
monseigneur
c----
to
the
sacristy
the
kneeling
nuns
roused
from
their
devout
abstraction
made
their
reverence
and
went
away
the
fashionable
lady
my
neighbour
rose
also
with
graceful
reserve
as
she
departed
her
glance
just
flitted
over
my
face
in
disapproval
half
dead
or
so
it
seemed
to
me
yet
intensely
alive
to
every
trifle
i
sat
among
the
leisurely
moving
crowd
then
rose
too
and
went
toward
the
door
i
had
slept
through
the
sermon
had
i
slept
through
the
sermon
i
looked
up
and
saw
him
passing
along
the
gallery
to
his
place
only
his
side
i
saw
the
thin
bent
arm
in
its
black
covering
looked
like
one
of
those
devilish
nameless
instruments
which
lie
in
the
disused
torture-chambers
of
mediaeval
castles
but
i
had
escaped
him
though
his
eyes
had
said
i
should
not
had
i
escaped
him
that
which
gave
him
the
power
over
me
came
back
out
of
oblivion
where
i
had
hoped
to
keep
it
for
i
knew
him
now
death
and
the
awful
abode
of
lost
souls
whither
my
weakness
long
ago
had
sent
him--they
had
changed
him
for
every
other
eye
but
not
for
mine
i
had
recognized
him
almost
from
the
first
i
had
never
doubted
what
he
was
come
to
do
and
now
i
knew
while
my
body
sat
safe
in
the
cheerful
little
church
he
had
been
hunting
my
soul
in
the
court
of
the
dragon
i
crept
to
the
door
the
organ
broke
out
overhead
with
a
blare
a
dazzling
light
filled
the
church
blotting
the
altar
from
my
eyes
the
people
faded
away
the
arches
the
vaulted
roof
vanished
i
raised
my
seared
eyes
to
the
fathomless
glare
and
i
saw
the
black
stars
hanging
in
the
heavens
and
the
wet
winds
from
the
lake
of
hali
chilled
my
face
and
now
far
away
over
leagues
of
tossing
cloud-waves
i
saw
the
moon
dripping
with
spray
and
beyond
the
towers
of
carcosa
rose
behind
the
moon
death
and
the
awful
abode
of
lost
souls
whither
my
weakness
long
ago
had
sent
him
had
changed
him
for
every
other
eye
but
mine
and
now
i
heard
his
voice
rising
swelling
thundering
through
the
flaring
light
and
as
i
fell
the
radiance
increasing
increasing
poured
over
me
in
waves
of
flame
then
i
sank
into
the
depths
and
i
heard
the
king
in
yellow
whispering
to
my
soul
it
is
a
fearful
thing
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
living
god
the
yellow
sign
let
the
red
dawn
surmise
what
we
shall
do
when
this
blue
starlight
dies
and
all
is
through
i
there
are
so
many
things
which
are
impossible
to
explain
why
should
certain
chords
in
music
make
me
think
of
the
brown
and
golden
tints
of
autumn
foliage
why
should
the
mass
of
sainte
cã©cile
bend
my
thoughts
wandering
among
caverns
whose
walls
blaze
with
ragged
masses
of
virgin
silver
what
was
it
in
the
roar
and
turmoil
of
broadway
at
six
o'clock
that
flashed
before
my
eyes
the
picture
of
a
still
breton
forest
where
sunlight
filtered
through
spring
foliage
and
sylvia
bent
half
curiously
half
tenderly
over
a
small
green
lizard
murmuring
to
think
that
this
also
is
a
little
ward
of
god
when
i
first
saw
the
watchman
his
back
was
toward
me
i
looked
at
him
indifferently
until
he
went
into
the
church
i
paid
no
more
attention
to
him
than
i
had
to
any
other
man
who
lounged
through
washington
square
that
morning
and
when
i
shut
my
window
and
turned
back
into
my
studio
i
had
forgotten
him
late
in
the
afternoon
the
day
being
warm
i
raised
the
window
again
and
leaned
out
to
get
a
sniff
of
air
a
man
was
standing
in
the
courtyard
of
the
church
and
i
noticed
him
again
with
as
little
interest
as
i
had
that
morning
i
looked
across
the
square
to
where
the
fountain
was
playing
and
then
with
my
mind
filled
with
vague
impressions
of
trees
asphalt
drives
and
the
moving
groups
of
nursemaids
and
holiday-makers
i
started
to
walk
back
to
my
easel
as
i
turned
my
listless
glance
included
the
man
below
in
the
churchyard
his
face
was
toward
me
now
and
with
a
perfectly
involuntary
movement
i
bent
to
see
it
at
the
same
moment
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
me
instantly
i
thought
of
a
coffin-worm
whatever
it
was
about
the
man
that
repelled
me
i
did
not
know
but
the
impression
of
a
plump
white
grave-worm
was
so
intense
and
nauseating
that
i
must
have
shown
it
in
my
expression
for
he
turned
his
puffy
face
away
with
a
movement
which
made
me
think
of
a
disturbed
grub
in
a
chestnut
i
went
back
to
my
easel
and
motioned
the
model
to
resume
her
pose
after
working
a
while
i
was
satisfied
that
i
was
spoiling
what
i
had
done
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
i
took
up
a
palette
knife
and
scraped
the
colour
out
again
the
flesh
tones
were
sallow
and
unhealthy
and
i
did
not
understand
how
i
could
have
painted
such
sickly
colour
into
a
study
which
before
that
had
glowed
with
healthy
tones
i
looked
at
tessie
she
had
not
changed
and
the
clear
flush
of
health
dyed
her
neck
and
cheeks
as
i
frowned
is
it
something
i've
done
she
said
no--i've
made
a
mess
of
this
arm
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
can't
see
how
i
came
to
paint
such
mud
as
that
into
the
canvas
i
replied
don't
i
pose
well
she
insisted
of
course
perfectly
then
it's
not
my
fault
no
it's
my
own
i
am
very
sorry
she
said
i
told
her
she
could
rest
while
i
applied
rag
and
turpentine
to
the
plague
spot
on
my
canvas
and
she
went
off
to
smoke
a
cigarette
and
look
over
the
illustrations
in
the
courrier
franã§ais
i
did
not
know
whether
it
was
something
in
the
turpentine
or
a
defect
in
the
canvas
but
the
more
i
scrubbed
the
more
that
gangrene
seemed
to
spread
i
worked
like
a
beaver
to
get
it
out
and
yet
the
disease
appeared
to
creep
from
limb
to
limb
of
the
study
before
me
alarmed
i
strove
to
arrest
it
but
now
the
colour
on
the
breast
changed
and
the
whole
figure
seemed
to
absorb
the
infection
as
a
sponge
soaks
up
water
vigorously
i
plied
palette-knife
turpentine
and
scraper
thinking
all
the
time
what
a
sã©ance
i
should
hold
with
duval
who
had
sold
me
the
canvas
but
soon
i
noticed
that
it
was
not
the
canvas
which
was
defective
nor
yet
the
colours
of
edward
it
must
be
the
turpentine
i
thought
angrily
or
else
my
eyes
have
become
so
blurred
and
confused
by
the
afternoon
light
that
i
can't
see
straight
i
called
tessie
the
model
she
came
and
leaned
over
my
chair
blowing
rings
of
smoke
into
the
air
what
have
you
been
doing
to
it
she
exclaimed
nothing
i
growled
it
must
be
this
turpentine
what
a
horrible
colour
it
is
now
she
continued
do
you
think
my
flesh
resembles
green
cheese
no
i
don't
i
said
angrily
did
you
ever
know
me
to
paint
like
that
before
no
indeed
well
then
it
must
be
the
turpentine
or
something
she
admitted
she
slipped
on
a
japanese
robe
and
walked
to
the
window
i
scraped
and
rubbed
until
i
was
tired
and
finally
picked
up
my
brushes
and
hurled
them
through
the
canvas
with
a
forcible
expression
the
tone
alone
of
which
reached
tessie's
ears
nevertheless
she
promptly
began
that's
it
swear
and
act
silly
and
ruin
your
brushes
you
have
been
three
weeks
on
that
study
and
now
look
what's
the
good
of
ripping
the
canvas
what
creatures
artists
are
i
felt
about
as
much
ashamed
as
i
usually
did
after
such
an
outbreak
and
i
turned
the
ruined
canvas
to
the
wall
tessie
helped
me
clean
my
brushes
and
then
danced
away
to
dress
from
the
screen
she
regaled
me
with
bits
of
advice
concerning
whole
or
partial
loss
of
temper
until
thinking
perhaps
i
had
been
tormented
sufficiently
she
came
out
to
implore
me
to
button
her
waist
where
she
could
not
reach
it
on
the
shoulder
everything
went
wrong
from
the
time
you
came
back
from
the
window
and
talked
about
that
horrid-looking
man
you
saw
in
the
churchyard
she
announced
yes
he
probably
bewitched
the
picture
i
said
yawning
i
looked
at
my
watch
it's
after
six
i
know
said
tessie
adjusting
her
hat
before
the
mirror
yes
i
replied
i
didn't
mean
to
keep
you
so
long
i
leaned
out
of
the
window
but
recoiled
with
disgust
for
the
young
man
with
the
pasty
face
stood
below
in
the
churchyard
tessie
saw
my
gesture
of
disapproval
and
leaned
from
the
window
is
that
the
man
you
don't
like
she
whispered
i
nodded
i
can't
see
his
face
but
he
does
look
fat
and
soft
someway
or
other
she
continued
turning
to
look
at
me
he
reminds
me
of
a
dream--an
awful
dream
i
once
had
or
she
mused
looking
down
at
her
shapely
shoes
was
it
a
dream
after
all
how
should
i
know
i
smiled
tessie
smiled
in
reply
you
were
in
it
she
said
so
perhaps
you
might
know
something
about
it
tessie
tessie
i
protested
don't
you
dare
flatter
by
saying
that
you
dream
about
me
but
i
did
she
insisted
shall
i
tell
you
about
it
go
ahead
i
replied
lighting
a
cigarette
tessie
leaned
back
on
the
open
window-sill
and
began
very
seriously
one
night
last
winter
i
was
lying
in
bed
thinking
about
nothing
at
all
in
particular
i
had
been
posing
for
you
and
i
was
tired
out
yet
it
seemed
impossible
for
me
to
sleep
i
heard
the
bells
in
the
city
ring
ten
eleven
and
midnight
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
about
midnight
because
i
don't
remember
hearing
the
bells
after
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
scarcely
closed
my
eyes
when
i
dreamed
that
something
impelled
me
to
go
to
the
window
i
rose
and
raising
the
sash
leaned
out
twenty-fifth
street
was
deserted
as
far
as
i
could
see
i
began
to
be
afraid
everything
outside
seemed
so--so
black
and
uncomfortable
then
the
sound
of
wheels
in
the
distance
came
to
my
ears
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
that
was
what
i
must
wait
for
very
slowly
the
wheels
approached
and
finally
i
could
make
out
a
vehicle
moving
along
the
street
it
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
when
it
passed
beneath
my
window
i
saw
it
was
a
hearse
then
as
i
trembled
with
fear
the
driver
turned
and
looked
straight
at
me
when
i
awoke
i
was
standing
by
the
open
window
shivering
with
cold
but
the
black-plumed
hearse
and
the
driver
were
gone
i
dreamed
this
dream
again
in
march
last
and
again
awoke
beside
the
open
window
last
night
the
dream
came
again
you
remember
how
it
was
raining
when
i
awoke
standing
at
the
open
window
my
night-dress
was
soaked
but
where
did
i
come
into
the
dream
i
asked
you--you
were
in
the
coffin
but
you
were
not
dead
in
the
coffin
yes
how
did
you
know
could
you
see
me
no
i
only
knew
you
were
there
had
you
been
eating
welsh
rarebits
or
lobster
salad
i
began
laughing
but
the
girl
interrupted
me
with
a
frightened
cry
hello
what's
up
i
said
as
she
shrank
into
the
embrasure
by
the
window
the--the
man
below
in
the
churchyard--he
drove
the
hearse
nonsense
i
said
but
tessie's
eyes
were
wide
with
terror
i
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
man
was
gone
come
tessie
i
urged
don't
be
foolish
you
have
posed
too
long
you
are
nervous
do
you
think
i
could
forget
that
face
she
murmured
three
times
i
saw
the
hearse
pass
below
my
window
and
every
time
the
driver
turned
and
looked
up
at
me
oh
his
face
was
so
white
and--and
soft
it
looked
dead--it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
dead
a
long
time
i
induced
the
girl
to
sit
down
and
swallow
a
glass
of
marsala
then
i
sat
down
beside
her
and
tried
to
give
her
some
advice
look
here
tessie
i
said
you
go
to
the
country
for
a
week
or
two
and
you'll
have
no
more
dreams
about
hearses
you
pose
all
day
and
when
night
comes
your
nerves
are
upset
you
can't
keep
this
up
then
again
instead
of
going
to
bed
when
your
day's
work
is
done
you
run
off
to
picnics
at
sulzer's
park
or
go
to
the
eldorado
or
coney
island
and
when
you
come
down
here
next
morning
you
are
fagged
out
there
was
no
real
hearse
there
was
a
soft-shell
crab
dream
she
smiled
faintly
what
about
the
man
in
the
churchyard
oh
he's
only
an
ordinary
unhealthy
everyday
creature
as
true
as
my
name
is
tessie
reardon
i
swear
to
you
mr
scott
that
the
face
of
the
man
below
in
the
churchyard
is
the
face
of
the
man
who
drove
the
hearse
what
of
it
i
said
it's
an
honest
trade
then
you
think
i
did
see
the
hearse
oh
i
said
diplomatically
if
you
really
did
it
might
not
be
unlikely
that
the
man
below
drove
it
there
is
nothing
in
that
tessie
rose
unrolled
her
scented
handkerchief
and
taking
a
bit
of
gum
from
a
knot
in
the
hem
placed
it
in
her
mouth
then
drawing
on
her
gloves
she
offered
me
her
hand
with
a
frank
good-night
mr
scott
and
walked
out
ii
the
next
morning
thomas
the
bell-boy
brought
me
the
herald
and
a
bit
of
news
the
church
next
door
had
been
sold
i
thanked
heaven
for
it
not
that
being
a
catholic
i
had
any
repugnance
for
the
congregation
next
door
but
because
my
nerves
were
shattered
by
a
blatant
exhorter
whose
every
word
echoed
through
the
aisle
of
the
church
as
if
it
had
been
my
own
rooms
and
who
insisted
on
his
r's
with
a
nasal
persistence
which
revolted
my
every
instinct
then
too
there
was
a
fiend
in
human
shape
an
organist
who
reeled
off
some
of
the
grand
old
hymns
with
an
interpretation
of
his
own
and
i
longed
for
the
blood
of
a
creature
who
could
play
the
doxology
with
an
amendment
of
minor
chords
which
one
hears
only
in
a
quartet
of
very
young
undergraduates
i
believe
the
minister
was
a
good
man
but
when
he
bellowed
and
the
lorrrrd
said
unto
moses
the
lorrrd
is
a
man
of
war
the
lorrrd
is
his
name
my
wrath
shall
wax
hot
and
i
will
kill
you
with
the
sworrrrd
i
wondered
how
many
centuries
of
purgatory
it
would
take
to
atone
for
such
a
sin
who
bought
the
property
i
asked
thomas
nobody
that
i
knows
sir
they
do
say
the
gent
wot
owns
this
'ere
'amilton
flats
was
lookin'
at
it
'e
might
be
a
bildin'
more
studios
i
walked
to
the
window
the
young
man
with
the
unhealthy
face
stood
by
the
churchyard
gate
and
at
the
mere
sight
of
him
the
same
overwhelming
repugnance
took
possession
of
me
by
the
way
thomas
i
said
who
is
that
fellow
down
there
thomas
sniffed
that
there
worm
sir
'es
night-watchman
of
the
church
sir
'e
maikes
me
tired
a-sittin'
out
all
night
on
them
steps
and
lookin'
at
you
insultin'
like
i'd
a
punched

one
night
a

on
them

and
sez
'wat

sir
but
that's
'ow

sir
then
'e

and
i
sez

then
i
hopens

only

insultin'
like
then
i
'its
'im

but
ugh
'is
'ed
was
that
cold
and
mushy
it
ud
sicken
you
to
touch
'im
what
did
he
do
then
i
asked
curiously
'im
nawthin'
and
you
thomas
the
young
fellow
flushed
with
embarrassment
and
smiled
uneasily
mr
scott
sir
i
ain't
no
coward
an'
i
can't
make
it
out
at
all
why
i
run
i
was
in
the
5th
lawncers
sir
bugler
at
tel-el-kebir
an'
was
shot
by
the
wells
you
don't
mean
to
say
you
ran
away
yes
sir
i
run
why
that's
just
what
i
want
to
know
sir
i
grabbed
molly
an'
run
an'
the
rest
was
as
frightened
as
i
but
what
were
they
frightened
at
thomas
refused
to
answer
for
a
while
but
now
my
curiosity
was
aroused
about
the
repulsive
young
man
below
and
i
pressed
him
three
years'
sojourn
in
america
had
not
only
modified
thomas'
cockney
dialect
but
had
given
him
the
american's
fear
of
ridicule
you
won't
believe
me
mr
scott
sir
yes
i
will
you
will
lawf
at
me
sir
nonsense
he
hesitated
well
sir
it's
gawd's
truth
that
when
i
'it
'im
'e
grabbed
me
wrists
sir
and
when
i
twisted
'is
soft
mushy
fist
one
of
'is
fingers
come
off
in
me
'and
the
utter
loathing
and
horror
of
thomas'
face
must
have
been
reflected
in
my
own
for
he
added
it's
orful
an'
now
when
i
see
'im
i
just
go
away
'e
maikes
me
hill
when
thomas
had
gone
i
went
to
the
window
the
man
stood
beside
the
church-railing
with
both
hands
on
the
gate
but
i
hastily
retreated
to
my
easel
again
sickened
and
horrified
for
i
saw
that
the
middle
finger
of
his
right
hand
was
missing
at
nine
o'clock
tessie
appeared
and
vanished
behind
the
screen
with
a
merry
good
morning
mr
scott
when
she
had
reappeared
and
taken
her
pose
upon
the
model-stand
i
started
a
new
canvas
much
to
her
delight
she
remained
silent
as
long
as
i
was
on
the
drawing
but
as
soon
as
the
scrape
of
the
charcoal
ceased
and
i
took
up
my
fixative
she
began
to
chatter
oh
i
had
such
a
lovely
time
last
night
we
went
to
tony
pastor's
who
are
'we'
i
demanded
oh
maggie
you
know
mr
whyte's
model
and
pinkie
mccormick--we
call
her
pinkie
because
she's
got
that
beautiful
red
hair
you
artists
like
so
much--and
lizzie
burke
i
sent
a
shower
of
spray
from
the
fixative
over
the
canvas
and
said
well
go
on
we
saw
kelly
and
baby
barnes
the
skirt-dancer
and--and
all
the
rest
i
made
a
mash
then
you
have
gone
back
on
me
tessie
she
laughed
and
shook
her
head
he's
lizzie
burke's
brother
ed
he's
a
perfect
gen'l'man
i
felt
constrained
to
give
her
some
parental
advice
concerning
mashing
which
she
took
with
a
bright
smile
oh
i
can
take
care
of
a
strange
mash
she
said
examining
her
chewing
gum
but
ed
is
different
lizzie
is
my
best
friend
then
she
related
how
ed
had
come
back
from
the
stocking
mill
in
lowell
massachusetts
to
find
her
and
lizzie
grown
up
and
what
an
accomplished
young
man
he
was
and
how
he
thought
nothing
of
squandering
half-a-dollar
for
ice-cream
and
oysters
to
celebrate
his
entry
as
clerk
into
the
woollen
department
of
macy's
before
she
finished
i
began
to
paint
and
she
resumed
the
pose
smiling
and
chattering
like
a
sparrow
by
noon
i
had
the
study
fairly
well
rubbed
in
and
tessie
came
to
look
at
it
that's
better
she
said
i
thought
so
too
and
ate
my
lunch
with
a
satisfied
feeling
that
all
was
going
well
tessie
spread
her
lunch
on
a
drawing
table
opposite
me
and
we
drank
our
claret
from
the
same
bottle
and
lighted
our
cigarettes
from
the
same
match
i
was
very
much
attached
to
tessie
i
had
watched
her
shoot
up
into
a
slender
but
exquisitely
formed
woman
from
a
frail
awkward
child
she
had
posed
for
me
during
the
last
three
years
and
among
all
my
models
she
was
my
favourite
it
would
have
troubled
me
very
much
indeed
had
she
become
tough
or
fly
as
the
phrase
goes
but
i
never
noticed
any
deterioration
of
her
manner
and
felt
at
heart
that
she
was
all
right
she
and
i
never
discussed
morals
at
all
and
i
had
no
intention
of
doing
so
partly
because
i
had
none
myself
and
partly
because
i
knew
she
would
do
what
she
liked
in
spite
of
me
still
i
did
hope
she
would
steer
clear
of
complications
because
i
wished
her
well
and
then
also
i
had
a
selfish
desire
to
retain
the
best
model
i
had
i
knew
that
mashing
as
she
termed
it
had
no
significance
with
girls
like
tessie
and
that
such
things
in
america
did
not
resemble
in
the
least
the
same
things
in
paris
yet
having
lived
with
my
eyes
open
i
also
knew
that
somebody
would
take
tessie
away
some
day
in
one
manner
or
another
and
though
i
professed
to
myself
that
marriage
was
nonsense
i
sincerely
hoped
that
in
this
case
there
would
be
a
priest
at
the
end
of
the
vista
i
am
a
catholic
when
i
listen
to
high
mass
when
i
sign
myself
i
feel
that
everything
including
myself
is
more
cheerful
and
when
i
confess
it
does
me
good
a
man
who
lives
as
much
alone
as
i
do
must
confess
to
somebody
then
again
sylvia
was
catholic
and
it
was
reason
enough
for
me
but
i
was
speaking
of
tessie
which
is
very
different
tessie
also
was
catholic
and
much
more
devout
than
i
so
taking
it
all
in
all
i
had
little
fear
for
my
pretty
model
until
she
should
fall
in
love
but
then
i
knew
that
fate
alone
would
decide
her
future
for
her
and
i
prayed
inwardly
that
fate
would
keep
her
away
from
men
like
me
and
throw
into
her
path
nothing
but
ed
burkes
and
jimmy
mccormicks
bless
her
sweet
face
tessie
sat
blowing
rings
of
smoke
up
to
the
ceiling
and
tinkling
the
ice
in
her
tumbler
do
you
know
that
i
also
had
a
dream
last
night
i
observed
not
about
that
man
she
laughed
exactly
a
dream
similar
to
yours
only
much
worse
it
was
foolish
and
thoughtless
of
me
to
say
this
but
you
know
how
little
tact
the
average
painter
has
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
about
ten
o'clock
i
continued
and
after
a
while
i
dreamt
that
i
awoke
so
plainly
did
i
hear
the
midnight
bells
the
wind
in
the
tree-branches
and
the
whistle
of
steamers
from
the
bay
that
even
now
i
can
scarcely
believe
i
was
not
awake
i
seemed
to
be
lying
in
a
box
which
had
a
glass
cover
dimly
i
saw
the
street
lamps
as
i
passed
for
i
must
tell
you
tessie
the
box
in
which
i
reclined
appeared
to
lie
in
a
cushioned
wagon
which
jolted
me
over
a
stony
pavement
after
a
while
i
became
impatient
and
tried
to
move
but
the
box
was
too
narrow
my
hands
were
crossed
on
my
breast
so
i
could
not
raise
them
to
help
myself
i
listened
and
then
tried
to
call
my
voice
was
gone
i
could
hear
the
trample
of
the
horses
attached
to
the
wagon
and
even
the
breathing
of
the
driver
then
another
sound
broke
upon
my
ears
like
the
raising
of
a
window
sash
i
managed
to
turn
my
head
a
little
and
found
i
could
look
not
only
through
the
glass
cover
of
my
box
but
also
through
the
glass
panes
in
the
side
of
the
covered
vehicle
i
saw
houses
empty
and
silent
with
neither
light
nor
life
about
any
of
them
excepting
one
in
that
house
a
window
was
open
on
the
first
floor
and
a
figure
all
in
white
stood
looking
down
into
the
street
it
was
you
tessie
had
turned
her
face
away
from
me
and
leaned
on
the
table
with
her
elbow
i
could
see
your
face
i
resumed
and
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
very
sorrowful
then
we
passed
on
and
turned
into
a
narrow
black
lane
presently
the
horses
stopped
i
waited
and
waited
closing
my
eyes
with
ear
and
impatience
but
all
was
silent
as
the
grave
after
what
seemed
to
me
hours
i
began
to
feel
uncomfortable
a
sense
that
somebody
was
close
to
me
made
me
unclose
my
eyes
then
i
saw
the
white
face
of
the
hearse-driver
looking
at
me
through
the
coffin-lid----
a
sob
from
tessie
interrupted
me
she
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
i
saw
i
had
made
an
ass
of
myself
and
attempted
to
repair
the
damage
why
tess
i
said
i
only
told
you
this
to
show
you
what
influence
your
story
might
have
on
another
person's
dreams
you
don't
suppose
i
really
lay
in
a
coffin
do
you
what
are
you
trembling
for
don't
you
see
that
your
dream
and
my
unreasonable
dislike
for
that
inoffensive
watchman
of
the
church
simply
set
my
brain
working
as
soon
as
i
fell
asleep
she
laid
her
head
between
her
arms
and
sobbed
as
if
her
heart
would
break
what
a
precious
triple
donkey
i
had
made
of
myself
but
i
was
about
to
break
my
record
i
went
over
and
put
my
arm
about
her
tessie
dear
forgive
me
i
said
i
had
no
business
to
frighten
you
with
such
nonsense
you
are
too
sensible
a
girl
too
good
a
catholic
to
believe
in
dreams
her
hand
tightened
on
mine
and
her
head
fell
back
upon
my
shoulder
but
she
still
trembled
and
i
petted
her
and
comforted
her
come
tess
open
your
eyes
and
smile
her
eyes
opened
with
a
slow
languid
movement
and
met
mine
but
their
expression
was
so
queer
that
i
hastened
to
reassure
her
again
it's
all
humbug
tessie
you
surely
are
not
afraid
that
any
harm
will
come
to
you
because
of
that
no
she
said
but
her
scarlet
lips
quivered
then
what's
the
matter
are
you
afraid
yes
not
for
myself
for
me
then
i
demanded
gaily
for
you
she
murmured
in
a
voice
almost
inaudible
i--i
care
for
you
at
first
i
started
to
laugh
but
when
i
understood
her
a
shock
passed
through
me
and
i
sat
like
one
turned
to
stone
this
was
the
crowning
bit
of
idiocy
i
had
committed
during
the
moment
which
elapsed
between
her
reply
and
my
answer
i
thought
of
a
thousand
responses
to
that
innocent
confession
i
could
pass
it
by
with
a
laugh
i
could
misunderstand
her
and
assure
her
as
to
my
health
i
could
simply
point
out
that
it
was
impossible
she
could
love
me
but
my
reply
was
quicker
than
my
thoughts
and
i
might
think
and
think
now
when
it
was
too
late
for
i
had
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
that
evening
i
took
my
usual
walk
in
washington
park
pondering
over
the
occurrences
of
the
day
i
was
thoroughly
committed
there
was
no
back
out
now
and
i
stared
the
future
straight
in
the
face
i
was
not
good
not
even
scrupulous
but
i
had
no
idea
of
deceiving
either
myself
or
tessie
the
one
passion
of
my
life
lay
buried
in
the
sunlit
forests
of
brittany
was
it
buried
for
ever
hope
cried
no
for
three
years
i
had
been
listening
to
the
voice
of
hope
and
for
three
years
i
had
waited
for
a
footstep
on
my
threshold
had
sylvia
forgotten
no
cried
hope
i
said
that
i
was
no
good
that
is
true
but
still
i
was
not
exactly
a
comic
opera
villain
i
had
led
an
easy-going
reckless
life
taking
what
invited
me
of
pleasure
deploring
and
sometimes
bitterly
regretting
consequences
in
one
thing
alone
except
my
painting
was
i
serious
and
that
was
something
which
lay
hidden
if
not
lost
in
the
breton
forests
it
was
too
late
for
me
to
regret
what
had
occurred
during
the
day
whatever
it
had
been
pity
a
sudden
tenderness
for
sorrow
or
the
more
brutal
instinct
of
gratified
vanity
it
was
all
the
same
now
and
unless
i
wished
to
bruise
an
innocent
heart
my
path
lay
marked
before
me
the
fire
and
strength
the
depth
of
passion
of
a
love
which
i
had
never
even
suspected
with
all
my
imagined
experience
in
the
world
left
me
no
alternative
but
to
respond
or
send
her
away
whether
because
i
am
so
cowardly
about
giving
pain
to
others
or
whether
it
was
that
i
have
little
of
the
gloomy
puritan
in
me
i
do
not
know
but
i
shrank
from
disclaiming
responsibility
for
that
thoughtless
kiss
and
in
fact
had
no
time
to
do
so
before
the
gates
of
her
heart
opened
and
the
flood
poured
forth
others
who
habitually
do
their
duty
and
find
a
sullen
satisfaction
in
making
themselves
and
everybody
else
unhappy
might
have
withstood
it
i
did
not
i
dared
not
after
the
storm
had
abated
i
did
tell
her
that
she
might
better
have
loved
ed
burke
and
worn
a
plain
gold
ring
but
she
would
not
hear
of
it
and
i
thought
perhaps
as
long
as
she
had
decided
to
love
somebody
she
could
not
marry
it
had
better
be
me
i
at
least
could
treat
her
with
an
intelligent
affection
and
whenever
she
became
tired
of
her
infatuation
she
could
go
none
the
worse
for
it
for
i
was
decided
on
that
point
although
i
knew
how
hard
it
would
be
i
remembered
the
usual
termination
of
platonic
liaisons
and
thought
how
disgusted
i
had
been
whenever
i
heard
of
one
i
knew
i
was
undertaking
a
great
deal
for
so
unscrupulous
a
man
as
i
was
and
i
dreamed
the
future
but
never
for
one
moment
did
i
doubt
that
she
was
safe
with
me
had
it
been
anybody
but
tessie
i
should
not
have
bothered
my
head
about
scruples
for
it
did
not
occur
to
me
to
sacrifice
tessie
as
i
would
have
sacrificed
a
woman
of
the
world
i
looked
the
future
squarely
in
the
face
and
saw
the
several
probable
endings
to
the
affair
she
would
either
tire
of
the
whole
thing
or
become
so
unhappy
that
i
should
have
either
to
marry
her
or
go
away
if
i
married
her
we
would
be
unhappy
i
with
a
wife
unsuited
to
me
and
she
with
a
husband
unsuitable
for
any
woman
for
my
past
life
could
scarcely
entitle
me
to
marry
if
i
went
away
she
might
either
fall
ill
recover
and
marry
some
eddie
burke
or
she
might
recklessly
or
deliberately
go
and
do
something
foolish
on
the
other
hand
if
she
tired
of
me
then
her
whole
life
would
be
before
her
with
beautiful
vistas
of
eddie
burkes
and
marriage
rings
and
twins
and
harlem
flats
and
heaven
knows
what
as
i
strolled
along
through
the
trees
by
the
washington
arch
i
decided
that
she
should
find
a
substantial
friend
in
me
anyway
and
the
future
could
take
care
of
itself
then
i
went
into
the
house
and
put
on
my
evening
dress
for
the
little
faintly-perfumed
note
on
my
dresser
said
have
a
cab
at
the
stage
door
at
eleven
and
the
note
was
signed
edith
carmichel
metropolitan
theatre
i
took
supper
that
night
or
rather
we
took
supper
miss
carmichel
and
i
at
solari's
and
the
dawn
was
just
beginning
to
gild
the
cross
on
the
memorial
church
as
i
entered
washington
square
after
leaving
edith
at
the
brunswick
there
was
not
a
soul
in
the
park
as
i
passed
along
the
trees
and
took
the
walk
which
leads
from
the
garibaldi
statue
to
the
hamilton
apartment
house
but
as
i
passed
the
churchyard
i
saw
a
figure
sitting
on
the
stone
steps
in
spite
of
myself
a
chill
crept
over
me
at
the
sight
of
the
white
puffy
face
and
i
hastened
to
pass
then
he
said
something
which
might
have
been
addressed
to
me
or
might
merely
have
been
a
mutter
to
himself
but
a
sudden
furious
anger
flamed
up
within
me
that
such
a
creature
should
address
me
for
an
instant
i
felt
like
wheeling
about
and
smashing
my
stick
over
his
head
but
i
walked
on
and
entering
the
hamilton
went
to
my
apartment
for
some
time
i
tossed
about
the
bed
trying
to
get
the
sound
of
his
voice
out
of
my
ears
but
could
not
it
filled
my
head
that
muttering
sound
like
thick
oily
smoke
from
a
fat-rendering
vat
or
an
odour
of
noisome
decay
and
as
i
lay
and
tossed
about
the
voice
in
my
ears
seemed
more
distinct
and
i
began
to
understand
the
words
he
had
muttered
they
came
to
me
slowly
as
if
i
had
forgotten
them
and
at
last
i
could
make
some
sense
out
of
the
sounds
it
was
this
have
you
found
the
yellow
sign
have
you
found
the
yellow
sign
have
you
found
the
yellow
sign
i
was
furious
what
did
he
mean
by
that
then
with
a
curse
upon
him
and
his
i
rolled
over
and
went
to
sleep
but
when
i
awoke
later
i
looked
pale
and
haggard
for
i
had
dreamed
the
dream
of
the
night
before
and
it
troubled
me
more
than
i
cared
to
think
i
dressed
and
went
down
into
my
studio
tessie
sat
by
the
window
but
as
i
came
in
she
rose
and
put
both
arms
around
my
neck
for
an
innocent
kiss
she
looked
so
sweet
and
dainty
that
i
kissed
her
again
and
then
sat
down
before
the
easel
hello
where's
the
study
i
began
yesterday
i
asked
tessie
looked
conscious
but
did
not
answer
i
began
to
hunt
among
the
piles
of
canvases
saying
hurry
up
tess
and
get
ready
we
must
take
advantage
of
the
morning
light
when
at
last
i
gave
up
the
search
among
the
other
canvases
and
turned
to
look
around
the
room
for
the
missing
study
i
noticed
tessie
standing
by
the
screen
with
her
clothes
still
on
what's
the
matter
i
asked
don't
you
feel
well
yes
then
hurry
do
you
want
me
to
pose
as--as
i
have
always
posed
then
i
understood
here
was
a
new
complication
i
had
lost
of
course
the
best
nude
model
i
had
ever
seen
i
looked
at
tessie
her
face
was
scarlet
alas
alas
we
had
eaten
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
eden
and
native
innocence
were
dreams
of
the
past--i
mean
for
her
i
suppose
she
noticed
the
disappointment
on
my
face
for
she
said
i
will
pose
if
you
wish
the
study
is
behind
the
screen
here
where
i
put
it
no
i
said
we
will
begin
something
new
and
i
went
into
my
wardrobe
and
picked
out
a
moorish
costume
which
fairly
blazed
with
tinsel
it
was
a
genuine
costume
and
tessie
retired
to
the
screen
with
it
enchanted
when
she
came
forth
again
i
was
astonished
her
long
black
hair
was
bound
above
her
forehead
with
a
circlet
of
turquoises
and
the
ends
curled
about
her
glittering
girdle
her
feet
were
encased
in
the
embroidered
pointed
slippers
and
the
skirt
of
her
costume
curiously
wrought
with
arabesques
in
silver
fell
to
her
ankles
the
deep
metallic
blue
vest
embroidered
with
silver
and
the
short
mauresque
jacket
spangled
and
sewn
with
turquoises
became
her
wonderfully
she
came
up
to
me
and
held
up
her
face
smiling
i
slipped
my
hand
into
my
pocket
and
drawing
out
a
gold
chain
with
a
cross
attached
dropped
it
over
her
head
it's
yours
tessie
mine
she
faltered
yours
now
go
and
pose
then
with
a
radiant
smile
she
ran
behind
the
screen
and
presently
reappeared
with
a
little
box
on
which
was
written
my
name
i
had
intended
to
give
it
to
you
when
i
went
home
to-night
she
said
but
i
can't
wait
now
i
opened
the
box
on
the
pink
cotton
inside
lay
a
clasp
of
black
onyx
on
which
was
inlaid
a
curious
symbol
or
letter
in
gold
it
was
neither
arabic
nor
chinese
nor
as
i
found
afterwards
did
it
belong
to
any
human
script
it's
all
i
had
to
give
you
for
a
keepsake
she
said
timidly
i
was
annoyed
but
i
told
her
how
much
i
should
prize
it
and
promised
to
wear
it
always
she
fastened
it
on
my
coat
beneath
the
lapel
how
foolish
tess
to
go
and
buy
me
such
a
beautiful
thing
as
this
i
said
i
did
not
buy
it
she
laughed
where
did
you
get
it
then
she
told
me
how
she
had
found
it
one
day
while
coming
from
the
aquarium
in
the
battery
how
she
had
advertised
it
and
watched
the
papers
but
at
last
gave
up
all
hopes
of
finding
the
owner
that
was
last
winter
she
said
the
very
day
i
had
the
first
horrid
dream
about
the
hearse
i
remembered
my
dream
of
the
previous
night
but
said
nothing
and
presently
my
charcoal
was
flying
over
a
new
canvas
and
tessie
stood
motionless
on
the
model-stand
iii
the
day
following
was
a
disastrous
one
for
me
while
moving
a
framed
canvas
from
one
easel
to
another
my
foot
slipped
on
the
polished
floor
and
i
fell
heavily
on
both
wrists
they
were
so
badly
sprained
that
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
hold
a
brush
and
i
was
obliged
to
wander
about
the
studio
glaring
at
unfinished
drawings
and
sketches
until
despair
seized
me
and
i
sat
down
to
smoke
and
twiddle
my
thumbs
with
rage
the
rain
blew
against
the
windows
and
rattled
on
the
roof
of
the
church
driving
me
into
a
nervous
fit
with
its
interminable
patter
tessie
sat
sewing
by
the
window
and
every
now
and
then
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
me
with
such
innocent
compassion
that
i
began
to
feel
ashamed
of
my
irritation
and
looked
about
for
something
to
occupy
me
i
had
read
all
the
papers
and
all
the
books
in
the
library
but
for
the
sake
of
something
to
do
i
went
to
the
bookcases
and
shoved
them
open
with
my
elbow
i
knew
every
volume
by
its
colour
and
examined
them
all
passing
slowly
around
the
library
and
whistling
to
keep
up
my
spirits
i
was
turning
to
go
into
the
dining-room
when
my
eye
fell
upon
a
book
bound
in
serpent
skin
standing
in
a
corner
of
the
top
shelf
of
the
last
bookcase
i
did
not
remember
it
and
from
the
floor
could
not
decipher
the
pale
lettering
on
the
back
so
i
went
to
the
smoking-room
and
called
tessie
she
came
in
from
the
studio
and
climbed
up
to
reach
the
book
what
is
it
i
asked
the
king
in
yellow
i
was
dumfounded
who
had
placed
it
there
how
came
it
in
my
rooms
i
had
long
ago
decided
that
i
should
never
open
that
book
and
nothing
on
earth
could
have
persuaded
me
to
buy
it
fearful
lest
curiosity
might
tempt
me
to
open
it
i
had
never
even
looked
at
it
in
book-stores
if
i
ever
had
had
any
curiosity
to
read
it
the
awful
tragedy
of
young
castaigne
whom
i
knew
prevented
me
from
exploring
its
wicked
pages
i
had
always
refused
to
listen
to
any
description
of
it
and
indeed
nobody
ever
ventured
to
discuss
the
second
part
aloud
so
i
had
absolutely
no
knowledge
of
what
those
leaves
might
reveal
i
stared
at
the
poisonous
mottled
binding
as
i
would
at
a
snake
don't
touch
it
tessie
i
said
come
down
of
course
my
admonition
was
enough
to
arouse
her
curiosity
and
before
i
could
prevent
it
she
took
the
book
and
laughing
danced
off
into
the
studio
with
it
i
called
to
her
but
she
slipped
away
with
a
tormenting
smile
at
my
helpless
hands
and
i
followed
her
with
some
impatience
tessie
i
cried
entering
the
library
listen
i
am
serious
put
that
book
away
i
do
not
wish
you
to
open
it
the
library
was
empty
i
went
into
both
drawing-rooms
then
into
the
bedrooms
laundry
kitchen
and
finally
returned
to
the
library
and
began
a
systematic
search
she
had
hidden
herself
so
well
that
it
was
half-an-hour
later
when
i
discovered
her
crouching
white
and
silent
by
the
latticed
window
in
the
store-room
above
at
the
first
glance
i
saw
she
had
been
punished
for
her
foolishness
the
king
in
yellow
lay
at
her
feet
but
the
book
was
open
at
the
second
part
i
looked
at
tessie
and
saw
it
was
too
late
she
had
opened
the
king
in
yellow
then
i
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
into
the
studio
she
seemed
dazed
and
when
i
told
her
to
lie
down
on
the
sofa
she
obeyed
me
without
a
word
after
a
while
she
closed
her
eyes
and
her
breathing
became
regular
and
deep
but
i
could
not
determine
whether
or
not
she
slept
for
a
long
while
i
sat
silently
beside
her
but
she
neither
stirred
nor
spoke
and
at
last
i
rose
and
entering
the
unused
store-room
took
the
book
in
my
least
injured
hand
it
seemed
heavy
as
lead
but
i
carried
it
into
the
studio
again
and
sitting
down
on
the
rug
beside
the
sofa
opened
it
and
read
it
through
from
beginning
to
end
when
faint
with
excess
of
my
emotions
i
dropped
the
volume
and
leaned
wearily
back
against
the
sofa
tessie
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
me
we
had
been
speaking
for
some
time
in
a
dull
monotonous
strain
before
i
realized
that
we
were
discussing
the
king
in
yellow
oh
the
sin
of
writing
such
words--words
which
are
clear
as
crystal
limpid
and
musical
as
bubbling
springs
words
which
sparkle
and
glow
like
the
poisoned
diamonds
of
the
medicis
oh
the
wickedness
the
hopeless
damnation
of
a
soul
who
could
fascinate
and
paralyze
human
creatures
with
such
words--words
understood
by
the
ignorant
and
wise
alike
words
which
are
more
precious
than
jewels
more
soothing
than
music
more
awful
than
death
we
talked
on
unmindful
of
the
gathering
shadows
and
she
was
begging
me
to
throw
away
the
clasp
of
black
onyx
quaintly
inlaid
with
what
we
now
knew
to
be
the
yellow
sign
i
never
shall
know
why
i
refused
though
even
at
this
hour
here
in
my
bedroom
as
i
write
this
confession
i
should
be
glad
to
know
what
it
was
that
prevented
me
from
tearing
the
yellow
sign
from
my
breast
and
casting
it
into
the
fire
i
am
sure
i
wished
to
do
so
and
yet
tessie
pleaded
with
me
in
vain
night
fell
and
the
hours
dragged
on
but
still
we
murmured
to
each
other
of
the
king
and
the
pallid
mask
and
midnight
sounded
from
the
misty
spires
in
the
fog-wrapped
city
we
spoke
of
hastur
and
of
cassilda
while
outside
the
fog
rolled
against
the
blank
window-panes
as
the
cloud
waves
roll
and
break
on
the
shores
of
hali
the
house
was
very
silent
now
and
not
a
sound
came
up
from
the
misty
streets
tessie
lay
among
the
cushions
her
face
a
grey
blot
in
the
gloom
but
her
hands
were
clasped
in
mine
and
i
knew
that
she
knew
and
read
my
thoughts
as
i
read
hers
for
we
had
understood
the
mystery
of
the
hyades
and
the
phantom
of
truth
was
laid
then
as
we
answered
each
other
swiftly
silently
thought
on
thought
the
shadows
stirred
in
the
gloom
about
us
and
far
in
the
distant
streets
we
heard
a
sound
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
the
dull
crunching
of
wheels
nearer
and
yet
nearer
and
now
outside
before
the
door
it
ceased
and
i
dragged
myself
to
the
window
and
saw
a
black-plumed
hearse
the
gate
below
opened
and
shut
and
i
crept
shaking
to
my
door
and
bolted
it
but
i
knew
no
bolts
no
locks
could
keep
that
creature
out
who
was
coming
for
the
yellow
sign
and
now
i
heard
him
moving
very
softly
along
the
hall
now
he
was
at
the
door
and
the
bolts
rotted
at
his
touch
now
he
had
entered
with
eyes
starting
from
my
head
i
peered
into
the
darkness
but
when
he
came
into
the
room
i
did
not
see
him
it
was
only
when
i
felt
him
envelope
me
in
his
cold
soft
grasp
that
i
cried
out
and
struggled
with
deadly
fury
but
my
hands
were
useless
and
he
tore
the
onyx
clasp
from
my
coat
and
struck
me
full
in
the
face
then
as
i
fell
i
heard
tessie's
soft
cry
and
her
spirit
fled
and
even
while
falling
i
longed
to
follow
her
for
i
knew
that
the
king
in
yellow
had
opened
his
tattered
mantle
and
there
was
only
god
to
cry
to
now
i
could
tell
more
but
i
cannot
see
what
help
it
will
be
to
the
world
as
for
me
i
am
past
human
help
or
hope
as
i
lie
here
writing
careless
even
whether
or
not
i
die
before
i
finish
i
can
see
the
doctor
gathering
up
his
powders
and
phials
with
a
vague
gesture
to
the
good
priest
beside
me
which
i
understand
they
will
be
very
curious
to
know
the
tragedy--they
of
the
outside
world
who
write
books
and
print
millions
of
newspapers
but
i
shall
write
no
more
and
the
father
confessor
will
seal
my
last
words
with
the
seal
of
sanctity
when
his
holy
office
is
done
they
of
the
outside
world
may
send
their
creatures
into
wrecked
homes
and
death-smitten
firesides
and
their
newspapers
will
batten
on
blood
and
tears
but
with
me
their
spies
must
halt
before
the
confessional
they
know
that
tessie
is
dead
and
that
i
am
dying
they
know
how
the
people
in
the
house
aroused
by
an
infernal
scream
rushed
into
my
room
and
found
one
living
and
two
dead
but
they
do
not
know
what
i
shall
tell
them
now
they
do
not
know
that
the
doctor
said
as
he
pointed
to
a
horrible
decomposed
heap
on
the
floor--the
livid
corpse
of
the
watchman
from
the
church
i
have
no
theory
no
explanation
that
man
must
have
been
dead
for
months
i
think
i
am
dying
i
wish
the
priest
would--

there
be
three
things
which
are
too
wonderful
for
me
yea
four
which
i
know
not
the
way
of
an
eagle
in
the
air
the
way
of
a
serpent
upon
a
rock
the
way
of
a
ship
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
and
the
way
of
a
man
with
a
maid
i
the
utter
desolation
of
the
scene
began
to
have
its
effect
i
sat
down
to
face
the
situation
and
if
possible
recall
to
mind
some
landmark
which
might
aid
me
in
extricating
myself
from
my
present
position
if
i
could
only
find
the
ocean
again
all
would
be
clear
for
i
knew
one
could
see
the
island
of
groix
from
the
cliffs
i
laid
down
my
gun
and
kneeling
behind
a
rock
lighted
a
pipe
then
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
nearly
four
o'clock
i
might
have
wandered
far
from
kerselec
since
daybreak
standing
the
day
before
on
the
cliffs
below
kerselec
with
goulven
looking
out
over
the
sombre
moors
among
which
i
had
now
lost
my
way
these
downs
had
appeared
to
me
level
as
a
meadow
stretching
to
the
horizon
and
although
i
knew
how
deceptive
is
distance
i
could
not
realize
that
what
from
kerselec
seemed
to
be
mere
grassy
hollows
were
great
valleys
covered
with
gorse
and
heather
and
what
looked
like
scattered
boulders
were
in
reality
enormous
cliffs
of
granite
it's
a
bad
place
for
a
stranger
old
goulven
had
said
you'd
better
take
a
guide
and
i
had
replied
i
shall
not
lose
myself
now
i
knew
that
i
had
lost
myself
as
i
sat
there
smoking
with
the
sea-wind
blowing
in
my
face
on
every
side
stretched
the
moorland
covered
with
flowering
gorse
and
heath
and
granite
boulders
there
was
not
a
tree
in
sight
much
less
a
house
after
a
while
i
picked
up
the
gun
and
turning
my
back
on
the
sun
tramped
on
again
there
was
little
use
in
following
any
of
the
brawling
streams
which
every
now
and
then
crossed
my
path
for
instead
of
flowing
into
the
sea
they
ran
inland
to
reedy
pools
in
the
hollows
of
the
moors
i
had
followed
several
but
they
all
led
me
to
swamps
or
silent
little
ponds
from
which
the
snipe
rose
peeping
and
wheeled
away
in
an
ecstasy
of
fright
i
began
to
feel
fatigued
and
the
gun
galled
my
shoulder
in
spite
of
the
double
pads
the
sun
sank
lower
and
lower
shining
level
across
yellow
gorse
and
the
moorland
pools
as
i
walked
my
own
gigantic
shadow
led
me
on
seeming
to
lengthen
at
every
step
the
gorse
scraped
against
my
leggings
crackled
beneath
my
feet
showering
the
brown
earth
with
blossoms
and
the
brake
bowed
and
billowed
along
my
path
from
tufts
of
heath
rabbits
scurried
away
through
the
bracken
and
among
the
swamp
grass
i
heard
the
wild
duck's
drowsy
quack
once
a
fox
stole
across
my
path
and
again
as
i
stooped
to
drink
at
a
hurrying
rill
a
heron
flapped
heavily
from
the
reeds
beside
me
i
turned
to
look
at
the
sun
it
seemed
to
touch
the
edges
of
the
plain
when
at
last
i
decided
that
it
was
useless
to
go
on
and
that
i
must
make
up
my
mind
to
spend
at
least
one
night
on
the
moors
i
threw
myself
down
thoroughly
fagged
out
the
evening
sunlight
slanted
warm
across
my
body
but
the
sea-winds
began
to
rise
and
i
felt
a
chill
strike
through
me
from
my
wet
shooting-boots
high
overhead
gulls
were
wheeling
and
tossing
like
bits
of
white
paper
from
some
distant
marsh
a
solitary
curlew
called
little
by
little
the
sun
sank
into
the
plain
and
the
zenith
flushed
with
the
after-glow
i
watched
the
sky
change
from
palest
gold
to
pink
and
then
to
smouldering
fire
clouds
of
midges
danced
above
me
and
high
in
the
calm
air
a
bat
dipped
and
soared
my
eyelids
began
to
droop
then
as
i
shook
off
the
drowsiness
a
sudden
crash
among
the
bracken
roused
me
i
raised
my
eyes
a
great
bird
hung
quivering
in
the
air
above
my
face
for
an
instant
i
stared
incapable
of
motion
then
something
leaped
past
me
in
the
ferns
and
the
bird
rose
wheeled
and
pitched
headlong
into
the
brake
i
was
on
my
feet
in
an
instant
peering
through
the
gorse
there
came
the
sound
of
a
struggle
from
a
bunch
of
heather
close
by
and
then
all
was
quiet
i
stepped
forward
my
gun
poised
but
when
i
came
to
the
heather
the
gun
fell
under
my
arm
again
and
i
stood
motionless
in
silent
astonishment
a
dead
hare
lay
on
the
ground
and
on
the
hare
stood
a
magnificent
falcon
one
talon
buried
in
the
creature's
neck
the
other
planted
firmly
on
its
limp
flank
but
what
astonished
me
was
not
the
mere
sight
of
a
falcon
sitting
upon
its
prey
i
had
seen
that
more
than
once
it
was
that
the
falcon
was
fitted
with
a
sort
of
leash
about
both
talons
and
from
the
leash
hung
a
round
bit
of
metal
like
a
sleigh-bell
the
bird
turned
its
fierce
yellow
eyes
on
me
and
then
stooped
and
struck
its
curved
beak
into
the
quarry
at
the
same
instant
hurried
steps
sounded
among
the
heather
and
a
girl
sprang
into
the
covert
in
front
without
a
glance
at
me
she
walked
up
to
the
falcon
and
passing
her
gloved
hand
under
its
breast
raised
it
from
the
quarry
then
she
deftly
slipped
a
small
hood
over
the
bird's
head
and
holding
it
out
on
her
gauntlet
stooped
and
picked
up
the
hare
she
passed
a
cord
about
the
animal's
legs
and
fastened
the
end
of
the
thong
to
her
girdle
then
she
started
to
retrace
her
steps
through
the
covert
as
she
passed
me
i
raised
my
cap
and
she
acknowledged
my
presence
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
inclination
i
had
been
so
astonished
so
lost
in
admiration
of
the
scene
before
my
eyes
that
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
that
here
was
my
salvation
but
as
she
moved
away
i
recollected
that
unless
i
wanted
to
sleep
on
a
windy
moor
that
night
i
had
better
recover
my
speech
without
delay
at
my
first
word
she
hesitated
and
as
i
stepped
before
her
i
thought
a
look
of
fear
came
into
her
beautiful
eyes
but
as
i
humbly
explained
my
unpleasant
plight
her
face
flushed
and
she
looked
at
me
in
wonder
surely
you
did
not
come
from
kerselec
she
repeated
her
sweet
voice
had
no
trace
of
the
breton
accent
nor
of
any
accent
which
i
knew
and
yet
there
was
something
in
it
i
seemed
to
have
heard
before
something
quaint
and
indefinable
like
the
theme
of
an
old
song
i
explained
that
i
was
an
american
unacquainted
with
finistã¨re
shooting
there
for
my
own
amusement
an
american
she
repeated
in
the
same
quaint
musical
tones
i
have
never
before
seen
an
american
for
a
moment
she
stood
silent
then
looking
at
me
she
said
if
you
should
walk
all
night
you
could
not
reach
kerselec
now
even
if
you
had
a
guide
this
was
pleasant
news
but
i
began
if
i
could
only
find
a
peasant's
hut
where
i
might
get
something
to
eat
and
shelter
the
falcon
on
her
wrist
fluttered
and
shook
its
head
the
girl
smoothed
its
glossy
back
and
glanced
at
me
look
around
she
said
gently
can
you
see
the
end
of
these
moors
look
north
south
east
west
can
you
see
anything
but
moorland
and
bracken
no
i
said
the
moor
is
wild
and
desolate
it
is
easy
to
enter
but
sometimes
they
who
enter
never
leave
it
there
are
no
peasants'
huts
here
well
i
said
if
you
will
tell
me
in
which
direction
kerselec
lies
to-morrow
it
will
take
me
no
longer
to
go
back
than
it
has
to
come
she
looked
at
me
again
with
an
expression
almost
like
pity
ah
she
said
to
come
is
easy
and
takes
hours
to
go
is
different--and
may
take
centuries
i
stared
at
her
in
amazement
but
decided
that
i
had
misunderstood
her
then
before
i
had
time
to
speak
she
drew
a
whistle
from
her
belt
and
sounded
it
sit
down
and
rest
she
said
to
me
you
have
come
a
long
distance
and
are
tired
she
gathered
up
her
pleated
skirts
and
motioning
me
to
follow
picked
her
dainty
way
through
the
gorse
to
a
flat
rock
among
the
ferns
they
will
be
here
directly
she
said
and
taking
a
seat
at
one
end
of
the
rock
invited
me
to
sit
down
on
the
other
edge
the
after-glow
was
beginning
to
fade
in
the
sky
and
a
single
star
twinkled
faintly
through
the
rosy
haze
a
long
wavering
triangle
of
water-fowl
drifted
southward
over
our
heads
and
from
the
swamps
around
plover
were
calling
they
are
very
beautiful--these
moors
she
said
quietly
beautiful
but
cruel
to
strangers
i
answered
beautiful
and
cruel
she
repeated
dreamily
beautiful
and
cruel
like
a
woman
i
said
stupidly
oh
she
cried
with
a
little
catch
in
her
breath
and
looked
at
me
her
dark
eyes
met
mine
and
i
thought
she
seemed
angry
or
frightened
like
a
woman
she
repeated
under
her
breath
how
cruel
to
say
so
then
after
a
pause
as
though
speaking
aloud
to
herself
how
cruel
for
him
to
say
that
i
don't
know
what
sort
of
an
apology
i
offered
for
my
inane
though
harmless
speech
but
i
know
that
she
seemed
so
troubled
about
it
that
i
began
to
think
i
had
said
something
very
dreadful
without
knowing
it
and
remembered
with
horror
the
pitfalls
and
snares
which
the
french
language
sets
for
foreigners
while
i
was
trying
to
imagine
what
i
might
have
said
a
sound
of
voices
came
across
the
moor
and
the
girl
rose
to
her
feet
no
she
said
with
a
trace
of
a
smile
on
her
pale
face
i
will
not
accept
your
apologies
monsieur
but
i
must
prove
you
wrong
and
that
shall
be
my
revenge
look
here
come
hastur
and
raoul
two
men
loomed
up
in
the
twilight
one
had
a
sack
across
his
shoulders
and
the
other
carried
a
hoop
before
him
as
a
waiter
carries
a
tray
the
hoop
was
fastened
with
straps
to
his
shoulders
and
around
the
edge
of
the
circlet
sat
three
hooded
falcons
fitted
with
tinkling
bells
the
girl
stepped
up
to
the
falconer
and
with
a
quick
turn
of
her
wrist
transferred
her
falcon
to
the
hoop
where
it
quickly
sidled
off
and
nestled
among
its
mates
who
shook
their
hooded
heads
and
ruffled
their
feathers
till
the
belled
jesses
tinkled
again
the
other
man
stepped
forward
and
bowing
respectfully
took
up
the
hare
and
dropped
it
into
the
game-sack
these
are
my
piqueurs
said
the
girl
turning
to
me
with
a
gentle
dignity
raoul
is
a
good
fauconnier
and
i
shall
some
day
make
him
grand
veneur
hastur
is
incomparable
the
two
silent
men
saluted
me
respectfully
did
i
not
tell
you
monsieur
that
i
should
prove
you
wrong
she
continued
this
then
is
my
revenge
that
you
do
me
the
courtesy
of
accepting
food
and
shelter
at
my
own
house
before
i
could
answer
she
spoke
to
the
falconers
who
started
instantly
across
the
heath
and
with
a
gracious
gesture
to
me
she
followed
i
don't
know
whether
i
made
her
understand
how
profoundly
grateful
i
felt
but
she
seemed
pleased
to
listen
as
we
walked
over
the
dewy
heather
are
you
not
very
tired
she
asked
i
had
clean
forgotten
my
fatigue
in
her
presence
and
i
told
her
so
don't
you
think
your
gallantry
is
a
little
old-fashioned
she
said
and
when
i
looked
confused
and
humbled
she
added
quietly
oh
i
like
it
i
like
everything
old-fashioned
and
it
is
delightful
to
hear
you
say
such
pretty
things
the
moorland
around
us
was
very
still
now
under
its
ghostly
sheet
of
mist
the
plovers
had
ceased
their
calling
the
crickets
and
all
the
little
creatures
of
the
fields
were
silent
as
we
passed
yet
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
could
hear
them
beginning
again
far
behind
us
well
in
advance
the
two
tall
falconers
strode
across
the
heather
and
the
faint
jingling
of
the
hawks'
bells
came
to
our
ears
in
distant
murmuring
chimes
suddenly
a
splendid
hound
dashed
out
of
the
mist
in
front
followed
by
another
and
another
until
half-a-dozen
or
more
were
bounding
and
leaping
around
the
girl
beside
me
she
caressed
and
quieted
them
with
her
gloved
hand
speaking
to
them
in
quaint
terms
which
i
remembered
to
have
seen
in
old
french
manuscripts
then
the
falcons
on
the
circlet
borne
by
the
falconer
ahead
began
to
beat
their
wings
and
scream
and
from
somewhere
out
of
sight
the
notes
of
a
hunting-horn
floated
across
the
moor
the
hounds
sprang
away
before
us
and
vanished
in
the
twilight
the
falcons
flapped
and
squealed
upon
their
perch
and
the
girl
taking
up
the
song
of
the
horn
began
to
hum
clear
and
mellow
her
voice
sounded
in
the
night
air

as
i
listened
to
her
lovely
voice
a
grey
mass
which
rapidly
grew
more
distinct
loomed
up
in
front
and
the
horn
rang
out
joyously
through
the
tumult
of
the
hounds
and
falcons
a
torch
glimmered
at
a
gate
a
light
streamed
through
an
opening
door
and
we
stepped
upon
a
wooden
bridge
which
trembled
under
our
feet
and
rose
creaking
and
straining
behind
us
as
we
passed
over
the
moat
and
into
a
small
stone
court
walled
on
every
side
from
an
open
doorway
a
man
came
and
bending
in
salutation
presented
a
cup
to
the
girl
beside
me
she
took
the
cup
and
touched
it
with
her
lips
then
lowering
it
turned
to
me
and
said
in
a
low
voice
i
bid
you
welcome
at
that
moment
one
of
the
falconers
came
with
another
cup
but
before
handing
it
to
me
presented
it
to
the
girl
who
tasted
it
the
falconer
made
a
gesture
to
receive
it
but
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
stepping
forward
offered
me
the
cup
with
her
own
hands
i
felt
this
to
be
an
act
of
extraordinary
graciousness
but
hardly
knew
what
was
expected
of
me
and
did
not
raise
it
to
my
lips
at
once
the
girl
flushed
crimson
i
saw
that
i
must
act
quickly
mademoiselle
i
faltered
a
stranger
whom
you
have
saved
from
dangers
he
may
never
realize
empties
this
cup
to
the
gentlest
and
loveliest
hostess
of
france
in
his
name
she
murmured
crossing
herself
as
i
drained
the
cup
then
stepping
into
the
doorway
she
turned
to
me
with
a
pretty
gesture
and
taking
my
hand
in
hers
led
me
into
the
house
saying
again
and
again
you
are
very
welcome
indeed
you
are
welcome
to
the
chã¢teau
d'ys
ii
i
awoke
next
morning
with
the
music
of
the
horn
in
my
ears
and
leaping
out
of
the
ancient
bed
went
to
a
curtained
window
where
the
sunlight
filtered
through
little
deep-set
panes
the
horn
ceased
as
i
looked
into
the
court
below
a
man
who
might
have
been
brother
to
the
two
falconers
of
the
night
before
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
pack
of
hounds
a
curved
horn
was
strapped
over
his
back
and
in
his
hand
he
held
a
long-lashed
whip
the
dogs
whined
and
yelped
dancing
around
him
in
anticipation
there
was
the
stamp
of
horses
too
in
the
walled
yard
mount
cried
a
voice
in
breton
and
with
a
clatter
of
hoofs
the
two
falconers
with
falcons
upon
their
wrists
rode
into
the
courtyard
among
the
hounds
then
i
heard
another
voice
which
sent
the
blood
throbbing
through
my
heart
piriou

and
spare
neither

nor

thou

like

thou

not
find
it
so
simple
to
govern
that

last
week
he
foamed
au

and
lost
the

although
he
is
used
to

a

was
i
dreaming
the
old
language
of
falconry
which
i
had
read
in
yellow
manuscripts--the
old
forgotten
french
of
the
middle
ages
was
sounding
in
my
ears
while
the
hounds
bayed
and
the
hawks'
bells
tinkled
accompaniment
to
the
stamping
horses
she
spoke
again
in
the
sweet
forgotten
language
if
you
would
rather
attach
the
longe
and
leave
thy
hagard
au

i
shall
say
nothing
for
it
were
a

to

so
fair
a

sport
with
an
ill-trained

is
possibly
the

i
was
perhaps
hasty
with
the
bird
it
takes
time
to
pass
ã
la

and
the
exercises
d'escap
then
the
falconer
raoul
bowed
in
his
stirrups
and
replied
if
it
be
the
pleasure
of
mademoiselle
i
shall
keep
the

it
is
my
wish
she
answered
falconry
i
know
but
you
have
yet
to
give
me
many
a
lesson
in

my
poor
raoul
sieur

mount
the
huntsman
sprang
into
an
archway
and
in
an
instant
returned
mounted
upon
a
strong
black
horse
followed
by
a
piqueur
also
mounted
ah
she
cried
joyously

all

thy

the
silvery
music
of
the
hunting-horn
filled
the
courtyard
the
hounds
sprang
through
the
gateway
and
galloping
hoof-beats
plunged
out
of
the
paved
court
loud
on
the
drawbridge
suddenly
muffled
then
lost
in
the
heather
and
bracken
of
the
moors
distant
and
more
distant
sounded
the
horn
until
it
became
so
faint
that
the
sudden
carol
of
a
soaring
lark
drowned
it
in
my
ears
i
heard
the
voice
below
responding
to
some
call
from
within
the
house
i
do
not
regret
the
chase
i
will
go
another
time
courtesy
to
the
stranger
pelagie
remember
and
a
feeble
voice
came
quavering
from
within
the
house
courtoisie
i
stripped
and
rubbed
myself
from
head
to
foot
in
the
huge
earthen
basin
of
icy
water
which
stood
upon
the
stone
floor
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
then
i
looked
about
for
my
clothes
they
were
gone
but
on
a
settle
near
the
door
lay
a
heap
of
garments
which
i
inspected
with
astonishment
as
my
clothes
had
vanished
i
was
compelled
to
attire
myself
in
the
costume
which
had
evidently
been
placed
there
for
me
to
wear
while
my
own
clothes
dried
everything
was
there
cap
shoes
and
hunting
doublet
of
silvery
grey
homespun
but
the
close-fitting
costume
and
seamless
shoes
belonged
to
another
century
and
i
remembered
the
strange
costumes
of
the
three
falconers
in
the
court-yard
i
was
sure
that
it
was
not
the
modern
dress
of
any
portion
of
france
or
brittany
but
not
until
i
was
dressed
and
stood
before
a
mirror
between
the
windows
did
i
realize
that
i
was
clothed
much
more
like
a
young
huntsman
of
the
middle
ages
than
like
a
breton
of
that
day
i
hesitated
and
picked
up
the
cap
should
i
go
down
and
present
myself
in
that
strange
guise
there
seemed
to
be
no
help
for
it
my
own
clothes
were
gone
and
there
was
no
bell
in
the
ancient
chamber
to
call
a
servant
so
i
contented
myself
with
removing
a
short
hawk's
feather
from
the
cap
and
opening
the
door
went
downstairs
by
the
fireplace
in
the
large
room
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
an
old
breton
woman
sat
spinning
with
a
distaff
she
looked
up
at
me
when
i
appeared
and
smiling
frankly
wished
me
health
in
the
breton
language
to
which
i
laughingly
replied
in
french
at
the
same
moment
my
hostess
appeared
and
returned
my
salutation
with
a
grace
and
dignity
that
sent
a
thrill
to
my
heart
her
lovely
head
with
its
dark
curly
hair
was
crowned
with
a
head-dress
which
set
all
doubts
as
to
the
epoch
of
my
own
costume
at
rest
her
slender
figure
was
exquisitely
set
off
in
the
homespun
hunting-gown
edged
with
silver
and
on
her
gauntlet-covered
wrist
she
bore
one
of
her
petted
hawks
with
perfect
simplicity
she
took
my
hand
and
led
me
into
the
garden
in
the
court
and
seating
herself
before
a
table
invited
me
very
sweetly
to
sit
beside
her
then
she
asked
me
in
her
soft
quaint
accent
how
i
had
passed
the
night
and
whether
i
was
very
much
inconvenienced
by
wearing
the
clothes
which
old
pelagie
had
put
there
for
me
while
i
slept
i
looked
at
my
own
clothes
and
shoes
drying
in
the
sun
by
the
garden-wall
and
hated
them
what
horrors
they
were
compared
with
the
graceful
costume
which
i
now
wore
i
told
her
this
laughing
but
she
agreed
with
me
very
seriously
we
will
throw
them
away
she
said
in
a
quiet
voice
in
my
astonishment
i
attempted
to
explain
that
i
not
only
could
not
think
of
accepting
clothes
from
anybody
although
for
all
i
knew
it
might
be
the
custom
of
hospitality
in
that
part
of
the
country
but
that
i
should
cut
an
impossible
figure
if
i
returned
to
france
clothed
as
i
was
then
she
laughed
and
tossed
her
pretty
head
saying
something
in
old
french
which
i
did
not
understand
and
then
pelagie
trotted
out
with
a
tray
on
which
stood
two
bowls
of
milk
a
loaf
of
white
bread
fruit
a
platter
of
honey-comb
and
a
flagon
of
deep
red
wine
you
see
i
have
not
yet
broken
my
fast
because
i
wished
you
to
eat
with
me
but
i
am
very
hungry
she
smiled
i
would
rather
die
than
forget
one
word
of
what
you
have
said
i
blurted
out
while
my
cheeks
burned
she
will
think
me
mad
i
added
to
myself
but
she
turned
to
me
with
sparkling
eyes
ah
she
murmured
then
monsieur
knows
all
that
there
is
of
chivalry--
she
crossed
herself
and
broke
bread
i
sat
and
watched
her
white
hands
not
daring
to
raise
my
eyes
to
hers
will
you
not
eat
she
asked
why
do
you
look
so
troubled
ah
why
i
knew
it
now
i
knew
i
would
give
my
life
to
touch
with
my
lips
those
rosy
palms--i
understood
now
that
from
the
moment
when
i
looked
into
her
dark
eyes
there
on
the
moor
last
night
i
had
loved
her
my
great
and
sudden
passion
held
me
speechless
are
you
ill
at
ease
she
asked
again
then
like
a
man
who
pronounces
his
own
doom
i
answered
in
a
low
voice
yes
i
am
ill
at
ease
for
love
of
you
and
as
she
did
not
stir
nor
answer
the
same
power
moved
my
lips
in
spite
of
me
and
i
said
i
who
am
unworthy
of
the
lightest
of
your
thoughts
i
who
abuse
hospitality
and
repay
your
gentle
courtesy
with
bold
presumption
i
love
you
she
leaned
her
head
upon
her
hands
and
answered
softly
i
love
you
your
words
are
very
dear
to
me
i
love
you
then
i
shall
win
you
win
me
she
replied
but
all
the
time
i
had
been
sitting
silent
my
face
turned
toward
her
she
also
silent
her
sweet
face
resting
on
her
upturned
palm
sat
facing
me
and
as
her
eyes
looked
into
mine
i
knew
that
neither
she
nor
i
had
spoken
human
speech
but
i
knew
that
her
soul
had
answered
mine
and
i
drew
myself
up
feeling
youth
and
joyous
love
coursing
through
every
vein
she
with
a
bright
colour
in
her
lovely
face
seemed
as
one
awakened
from
a
dream
and
her
eyes
sought
mine
with
a
questioning
glance
which
made
me
tremble
with
delight
we
broke
our
fast
speaking
of
ourselves
i
told
her
my
name
and
she
told
me
hers
the
demoiselle
jeanne
d'ys
she
spoke
of
her
father
and
mother's
death
and
how
the
nineteen
of
her
years
had
been
passed
in
the
little
fortified
farm
alone
with
her
nurse
pelagie
glemarec
renã©
the
piqueur
and
the
four
falconers
raoul
gaston
hastur
and
the
sieur
piriou
louis
who
had
served
her
father
she
had
never
been
outside
the
moorland--never
even
had
seen
a
human
soul
before
except
the
falconers
and
pelagie
she
did
not
know
how
she
had
heard
of
kerselec
perhaps
the
falconers
had
spoken
of
it
she
knew
the
legends
of
loup
garou
and
jeanne
la
flamme
from
her
nurse
pelagie
she
embroidered
and
spun
flax
her
hawks
and
hounds
were
her
only
distraction
when
she
had
met
me
there
on
the
moor
she
had
been
so
frightened
that
she
almost
dropped
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
she
had
it
was
true
seen
ships
at
sea
from
the
cliffs
but
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
moors
over
which
she
galloped
were
destitute
of
any
sign
of
human
life
there
was
a
legend
which
old
pelagie
told
how
anybody
once
lost
in
the
unexplored
moorland
might
never
return
because
the
moors
were
enchanted
she
did
not
know
whether
it
was
true
she
never
had
thought
about
it
until
she
met
me
she
did
not
know
whether
the
falconers
had
even
been
outside
or
whether
they
could
go
if
they
would
the
books
in
the
house
which
pelagie
the
nurse
had
taught
her
to
read
were
hundreds
of
years
old
all
this
she
told
me
with
a
sweet
seriousness
seldom
seen
in
any
one
but
children
my
own
name
she
found
easy
to
pronounce
and
insisted
because
my
first
name
was
philip
i
must
have
french
blood
in
me
she
did
not
seem
curious
to
learn
anything
about
the
outside
world
and
i
thought
perhaps
she
considered
it
had
forfeited
her
interest
and
respect
from
the
stories
of
her
nurse
we
were
still
sitting
at
the
table
and
she
was
throwing
grapes
to
the
small
field
birds
which
came
fearlessly
to
our
very
feet
i
began
to
speak
in
a
vague
way
of
going
but
she
would
not
hear
of
it
and
before
i
knew
it
i
had
promised
to
stay
a
week
and
hunt
with
hawk
and
hound
in
their
company
i
also
obtained
permission
to
come
again
from
kerselec
and
visit
her
after
my
return
why
she
said
innocently
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
do
if
you
never
came
back
and
i
knowing
that
i
had
no
right
to
awaken
her
with
the
sudden
shock
which
the
avowal
of
my
own
love
would
bring
to
her
sat
silent
hardly
daring
to
breathe
you
will
come
very
often
she
asked
very
often
i
said
every
day
every
day
oh
she
sighed
i
am
very
happy
come
and
see
my
hawks
she
rose
and
took
my
hand
again
with
a
childlike
innocence
of
possession
and
we
walked
through
the
garden
and
fruit
trees
to
a
grassy
lawn
which
was
bordered
by
a
brook
over
the
lawn
were
scattered
fifteen
or
twenty
stumps
of
trees--partially
imbedded
in
the
grass--and
upon
all
of
these
except
two
sat
falcons
they
were
attached
to
the
stumps
by
thongs
which
were
in
turn
fastened
with
steel
rivets
to
their
legs
just
above
the
talons
a
little
stream
of
pure
spring
water
flowed
in
a
winding
course
within
easy
distance
of
each
perch
the
birds
set
up
a
clamour
when
the
girl
appeared
but
she
went
from
one
to
another
caressing
some
taking
others
for
an
instant
upon
her
wrist
or
stooping
to
adjust
their
jesses
are
they
not
pretty
she
said
see
here
is
a
falcon-gentil
we
call
it
'ignoble'
because
it
takes
the
quarry
in
direct
chase
this
is
a
blue
falcon
in
falconry
we
call
it
'noble'
because
it
rises
over
the
quarry
and
wheeling
drops
upon
it
from
above
this
white
bird
is
a
gerfalcon
from
the
north
it
is
also
'noble'
here
is
a
merlin
and
this
tiercelet
is
a
falcon-heroner
i
asked
her
how
she
had
learned
the
old
language
of
falconry
she
did
not
remember
but
thought
her
father
must
have
taught
it
to
her
when
she
was
very
young
then
she
led
me
away
and
showed
me
the
young
falcons
still
in
the
nest
they
are
termed
niais
in
falconry
she
explained
a
branchier
is
the
young
bird
which
is
just
able
to
leave
the
nest
and
hop
from
branch
to
branch
a
young
bird
which
has
not
yet
moulted
is
called
a
sors
and
a
muã©
is
a
hawk
which
has
moulted
in
captivity
when
we
catch
a
wild
falcon
which
has
changed
its
plumage
we
term
it
a
hagard
raoul
first
taught
me
to
dress
a
falcon
shall
i
teach
you
how
it
is
done
she
seated
herself
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
among
the
falcons
and
i
threw
myself
at
her
feet
to
listen
then
the
demoiselle
d'ys
held
up
one
rosy-tipped
finger
and
began
very
gravely
first
one
must
catch
the
falcon
i
am
caught
i
answered
she
laughed
very
prettily
and
told
me
my
dressage
would
perhaps
be
difficult
as
i
was
noble
i
am
already
tamed
i
replied
jessed
and
belled
she
laughed
delighted
oh
my
brave
falcon
then
you
will
return
at
my
call
i
am
yours
i
answered
gravely
she
sat
silent
for
a
moment
then
the
colour
heightened
in
her
cheeks
and
she
held
up
her
finger
again
saying
listen
i
wish
to
speak
of
falconry--
i
listen
countess
jeanne
d'ys
but
again
she
fell
into
the
reverie
and
her
eyes
seemed
fixed
on
something
beyond
the
summer
clouds
philip
she
said
at
last
jeanne
i
whispered
that
is
all--that
is
what
i
wished
she
sighed--philip
and
jeanne
she
held
her
hand
toward
me
and
i
touched
it
with
my
lips
win
me
she
said
but
this
time
it
was
the
body
and
soul
which
spoke
in
unison
after
a
while
she
began
again
let
us
speak
of
falconry
begin
i
replied
we
have
caught
the
falcon
then
jeanne
d'ys
took
my
hand
in
both
of
hers
and
told
me
how
with
infinite
patience
the
young
falcon
was
taught
to
perch
upon
the
wrist
how
little
by
little
it
became
used
to
the
belled
jesses
and
the
chaperon
ã
cornette
they
must
first
have
a
good
appetite
she
said
then
little
by
little
i
reduce
their
nourishment
which
in
falconry
we
call
pã¢t
when
after
many
nights
passed
au
bloc
as
these
birds
are
now
i
prevail
upon
the
hagard
to
stay
quietly
on
the
wrist
then
the
bird
is
ready
to
be
taught
to
come
for
its
food
i
fix
the
pã¢t
to
the
end
of
a
thong
or
leurre
and
teach
the
bird
to
come
to
me
as
soon
as
i
begin
to
whirl
the
cord
in
circles
about
my
head
at
first
i
drop
the
pã¢t
when
the
falcon
comes
and
he
eats
the
food
on
the
ground
after
a
little
he
will
learn
to
seize
the
leurre
in
motion
as
i
whirl
it
around
my
head
or
drag
it
over
the
ground
after
this
it
is
easy
to
teach
the
falcon
to
strike
at
game
always
remembering
to
'faire
courtoisie
ã¡
l'oiseau'
that
is
to
allow
the
bird
to
taste
the
quarry
a
squeal
from
one
of
the
falcons
interrupted
her
and
she
arose
to
adjust
the
longe
which
had
become
whipped
about
the
bloc
but
the
bird
still
flapped
its
wings
and
screamed
what
is
the
matter
she
said
philip
can
you
see
i
looked
around
and
at
first
saw
nothing
to
cause
the
commotion
which
was
now
heightened
by
the
screams
and
flapping
of
all
the
birds
then
my
eye
fell
upon
the
flat
rock
beside
the
stream
from
which
the
girl
had
risen
a
grey
serpent
was
moving
slowly
across
the
surface
of
the
boulder
and
the
eyes
in
its
flat
triangular
head
sparkled
like
jet
a
couleuvre
she
said
quietly
it
is
harmless
is
it
not
i
asked
she
pointed
to
the
black
v-shaped
figure
on
the
neck
it
is
certain
death
she
said
it
is
a
viper
we
watched
the
reptile
moving
slowly
over
the
smooth
rock
to
where
the
sunlight
fell
in
a
broad
warm
patch
i
started
forward
to
examine
it
but
she
clung
to
my
arm
crying
don't
philip
i
am
afraid
for
me
for
you
philip--i
love
you
then
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
but
all
i
could
say
was
jeanne
jeanne
jeanne
and
as
she
lay
trembling
on
my
breast
something
struck
my
foot
in
the
grass
below
but
i
did
not
heed
it
then
again
something
struck
my
ankle
and
a
sharp
pain
shot
through
me
i
looked
into
the
sweet
face
of
jeanne
d'ys
and
kissed
her
and
with
all
my
strength
lifted
her
in
my
arms
and
flung
her
from
me
then
bending
i
tore
the
viper
from
my
ankle
and
set
my
heel
upon
its
head
i
remember
feeling
weak
and
numb--i
remember
falling
to
the
ground
through
my
slowly
glazing
eyes
i
saw
jeanne's
white
face
bending
close
to
mine
and
when
the
light
in
my
eyes
went
out
i
still
felt
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
her
soft
cheek
against
my
drawn
lips
when
i
opened
my
eyes
i
looked
around
in
terror
jeanne
was
gone
i
saw
the
stream
and
the
flat
rock
i
saw
the
crushed
viper
in
the
grass
beside
me
but
the
hawks
and
blocs
had
disappeared
i
sprang
to
my
feet
the
garden
the
fruit
trees
the
drawbridge
and
the
walled
court
were
gone
i
stared
stupidly
at
a
heap
of
crumbling
ruins
ivy-covered
and
grey
through
which
great
trees
had
pushed
their
way
i
crept
forward
dragging
my
numbed
foot
and
as
i
moved
a
falcon
sailed
from
the
tree-tops
among
the
ruins
and
soaring
mounting
in
narrowing
circles
faded
and
vanished
in
the
clouds
above
jeanne
jeanne
i
cried
but
my
voice
died
on
my
lips
and
i
fell
on
my
knees
among
the
weeds
and
as
god
willed
it
i
not
knowing
had
fallen
kneeling
before
a
crumbling
shrine
carved
in
stone
for
our
mother
of
sorrows
i
saw
the
sad
face
of
the
virgin
wrought
in
the
cold
stone
i
saw
the
cross
and
thorns
at
her
feet
and
beneath
it
i
read
pray
for
the
soul
of
the
demoiselle
jeanne
d'ys
who
died
in
her
youth
for
love
of
philip
a
stranger
ad
1573
but
upon
the
icy
slab
lay
a
woman's
glove
still
warm
and
fragrant
the
prophets'
paradise
if
but
the
vine
and
love
abjuring
band
are
in
the
prophets'
paradise
to
stand
alack
i
doubt
the
prophets'
paradise
were
empty
as
the
hollow
of
one's
hand
the
studio
he
smiled
saying
seek
her
throughout
the
world
i
said
why
tell
me
of
the
world
my
world
is
here
between
these
walls
and
the
sheet
of
glass
above
here
among
gilded
flagons
and
dull
jewelled
arms
tarnished
frames
and
canvasses
black
chests
and
high-backed
chairs
quaintly
carved
and
stained
in
blue
and
gold
for
whom
do
you
wait
he
said
and
i
answered
when
she
comes
i
shall
know
her
on
my
hearth
a
tongue
of
flame
whispered
secrets
to
the
whitening
ashes
in
the
street
below
i
heard
footsteps
a
voice
and
a
song
for
whom
then
do
you
wait
he
said
and
i
answered
i
shall
know
her
footsteps
a
voice
and
a
song
in
the
street
below
and
i
knew
the
song
but
neither
the
steps
nor
the
voice
fool
he
cried
the
song
is
the
same
the
voice
and
steps
have
but
changed
with
years
on
the
hearth
a
tongue
of
flame
whispered
above
the
whitening
ashes
wait
no
more
they
have
passed
the
steps
and
the
voice
in
the
street
below
then
he
smiled
saying
for
whom
do
you
wait
seek
her
throughout
the
world
i
answered
my
world
is
here
between
these
walls
and
the
sheet
of
glass
above
here
among
gilded
flagons
and
dull
jewelled
arms
tarnished
frames
and
canvasses
black
chests
and
high-backed
chairs
quaintly
carved
and
stained
in
blue
and
gold
the
phantom
the
phantom
of
the
past
would
go
no
further
if
it
is
true
she
sighed
that
you
find
in
me
a
friend
let
us
turn
back
together
you
will
forget
here
under
the
summer
sky
i
held
her
close
pleading
caressing
i
seized
her
white
with
anger
but
she
resisted
if
it
is
true
she
sighed
that
you
find
in
me
a
friend
let
us
turn
back
together
the
phantom
of
the
past
would
go
no
further
the
sacrifice
i
went
into
a
field
of
flowers
whose
petals
are
whiter
than
snow
and
whose
hearts
are
pure
gold
far
afield
a
woman
cried
i
have
killed
him
i
loved
and
from
a
jar
she
poured
blood
upon
the
flowers
whose
petals
are
whiter
than
snow
and
whose
hearts
are
pure
gold
far
afield
i
followed
and
on
the
jar
i
read
a
thousand
names
while
from
within
the
fresh
blood
bubbled
to
the
brim
i
have
killed
him
i
loved
she
cried
the
world's
athirst
now
let
it
drink
she
passed
and
far
afield
i
watched
her
pouring
blood
upon
the
flowers
whose
petals
are
whiter
than
snow
and
whose
hearts
are
pure
gold
destiny
i
came
to
the
bridge
which
few
may
pass
pass
cried
the
keeper
but
i
laughed
saying
there
is
time
and
he
smiled
and
shut
the
gates
to
the
bridge
which
few
may
pass
came
young
and
old
all
were
refused
idly
i
stood
and
counted
them
until
wearied
of
their
noise
and
lamentations
i
came
again
to
the
bridge
which
few
may
pass
those
in
the
throng
about
the
gates
shrieked
out
he
comes
too
late
but
i
laughed
saying
there
is
time
pass
cried
the
keeper
as
i
entered
then
smiled
and
shut
the
gates
the
throng
there
where
the
throng
was
thickest
in
the
street
i
stood
with
pierrot
all
eyes
were
turned
on
me
what
are
they
laughing
at
i
asked
but
he
grinned
dusting
the
chalk
from
my
black
cloak
i
cannot
see
it
must
be
something
droll
perhaps
an
honest
thief
all
eyes
were
turned
on
me
he
has
robbed
you
of
your
purse
they
laughed
my
purse
i
cried
pierrot--help
it
is
a
thief
they
laughed
he
has
robbed
you
of
your
purse
then
truth
stepped
out
holding
a
mirror
if
he
is
an
honest
thief
cried
truth
pierrot
shall
find
him
with
this
mirror
but
he
only
grinned
dusting
the
chalk
from
my
black
cloak
you
see
he
said
truth
is
an
honest
thief
she
brings
you
back
your
mirror
all
eyes
were
turned
on
me
arrest
truth
i
cried
forgetting
it
was
not
a
mirror
but
a
purse
i
lost
standing
with
pierrot
there
where
the
throng
was
thickest
in
the
street
the
jester
was
she
fair
i
asked
but
he
only
chuckled
listening
to
the
bells
jingling
on
his
cap
stabbed
he
tittered
think
of
the
long
journey
the
days
of
peril
the
dreadful
nights
think
how
he
wandered
for
her
sake
year
after
year
through
hostile
lands
yearning
for
kith
and
kin
yearning
for
her
stabbed
he
tittered
listening
to
the
bells
jingling
on
his
cap
was
she
fair
i
asked
but
he
only
snarled
muttering
to
the
bells
jingling
on
his
cap
she
kissed
him
at
the
gate
he
tittered
but
in
the
hall
his
brother's
welcome
touched
his
heart
was
she
fair
i
asked
stabbed
he
chuckled

of
the

the
green
room
the
clown
turned
his
powdered
face
to
the
mirror
if
to
be
fair
is
to
be
beautiful
he
said
who
can
compare
with
me
in
my
white
mask
who
can
compare
with
him
in
his
white
mask
i
asked
of

i

you
are
very
beautiful

the
clown
turning
his
powdered
face
from
the
mirror
the
love
test
if
it
is
true
that
you

wait
no

her
these

would
dishonour
her

so
dishonour
you

dishonoured
if
it

that
you

said

then
wait
no

i
took
the
jewels
and
went
to
her
but
she
trod
upon
them
sobbing
teach
me
to
wait--i
love
you
then
wait

i
the
animal
paused
on
the
threshold
interrogative
alert
ready
for
flight
if
necessary
severn
laid
down
his
palette
and
held
out
a
hand
of
welcome
the
cat
remained
motionless
her
yellow
eyes
fastened
upon
severn
puss
he
said
in
his
low
pleasant
voice
come
in
the
tip
of
her
thin
tail
twitched
uncertainly
come
in
he
said
again
apparently
she
found
his
voice
reassuring
for
she
slowly
settled
upon
all
fours
her
eyes
still
fastened
upon
him
her
tail
tucked
under
her
gaunt
flanks
he
rose
from
his
easel
smiling
she
eyed
him
quietly
and
when
he
walked
toward
her
she
watched
him
bend
above
her
without
a
wince
her
eyes
followed
his
hand
until
it
touched
her
head
then
she
uttered
a
ragged
mew
it
had
long
been
severn's
custom
to
converse
with
animals
probably
because
he
lived
so
much
alone
and
now
he
said
what's
the
matter
puss
her
timid
eyes
sought
his
i
understand
he
said
gently
you
shall
have
it
at
once
then
moving
quietly
about
he
busied
himself
with
the
duties
of
a
host
rinsed
a
saucer
filled
it
with
the
rest
of
the
milk
from
the
bottle
on
the
window-sill
and
kneeling
down
crumbled
a
roll
into
the
hollow
of
his
hand
the
creature
rose
and
crept
toward
the
saucer
with
the
handle
of
a
palette-knife
he
stirred
the
crumbs
and
milk
together
and
stepped
back
as
she
thrust
her
nose
into
the
mess
he
watched
her
in
silence
from
time
to
time
the
saucer
clinked
upon
the
tiled
floor
as
she
reached
for
a
morsel
on
the
rim
and
at
last
the
bread
was
all
gone
and
her
purple
tongue
travelled
over
every
unlicked
spot
until
the
saucer
shone
like
polished
marble
then
she
sat
up
and
coolly
turning
her
back
to
him
began
her
ablutions
keep
it
up
said
severn
much
interested
you
need
it
she
flattened
one
ear
but
neither
turned
nor
interrupted
her
toilet
as
the
grime
was
slowly
removed
severn
observed
that
nature
had
intended
her
for
a
white
cat
her
fur
had
disappeared
in
patches
from
disease
or
the
chances
of
war
her
tail
was
bony
and
her
spine
sharp
but
what
charms
she
had
were
becoming
apparent
under
vigorous
licking
and
he
waited
until
she
had
finished
before
re-opening
the
conversation
when
at
last
she
closed
her
eyes
and
folded
her
forepaws
under
her
breast
he
began
again
very
gently
puss
tell
me
your
troubles
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
broke
into
a
harsh
rumbling
which
he
recognized
as
an
attempt
to
purr
he
bent
over
to
rub
her
cheek
and
she
mewed
again
an
amiable
inquiring
little
mew
to
which
he
replied
certainly
you
are
greatly
improved
and
when
you
recover
your
plumage
you
will
be
a
gorgeous
bird
much
flattered
she
stood
up
and
marched
around
and
around
his
legs
pushing
her
head
between
them
and
making
pleased
remarks
to
which
he
responded
with
grave
politeness
now
what
sent
you
here
he
said--here
into
the
street
of
the
four
winds
and
up
five
flights
to
the
very
door
where
you
would
be
welcome
what
was
it
that
prevented
your
meditated
flight
when
i
turned
from
my
canvas
to
encounter
your
yellow
eyes
are
you
a
latin
quarter
cat
as
i
am
a
latin
quarter
man
and
why
do
you
wear
a
rose-coloured
flowered
garter
buckled
about
your
neck
the
cat
had
climbed
into
his
lap
and
now
sat
purring
as
he
passed
his
hand
over
her
thin
coat
excuse
me
he
continued
in
lazy
soothing
tones
harmonizing
with
her
purring
if
i
seem
indelicate
but
i
cannot
help
musing
on
this
rose-coloured
garter
flowered
so
quaintly
and
fastened
with
a
silver
clasp
for
the
clasp
is
silver
i
can
see
the
mint
mark
on
the
edge
as
is
prescribed
by
the
law
of
the
french
republic
now
why
is
this
garter
woven
of
rose
silk
and
delicately
embroidered--why
is
this
silken
garter
with
its
silver
clasp
about
your
famished
throat
am
i
indiscreet
when
i
inquire
if
its
owner
is
your
owner
is
she
some
aged
dame
living
in
memory
of
youthful
vanities
fond
doting
on
you
decorating
you
with
her
intimate
personal
attire
the
circumference
of
the
garter
would
suggest
this
for
your
neck
is
thin
and
the
garter
fits
you
but
then
again
i
notice--i
notice
most
things--that
the
garter
is
capable
of
being
much
enlarged
these
small
silver-rimmed
eyelets
of
which
i
count
five
are
proof
of
that
and
now
i
observe
that
the
fifth
eyelet
is
worn
out
as
though
the
tongue
of
the
clasp
were
accustomed
to
lie
there
that
seems
to
argue
a
well-rounded
form
the
cat
curled
her
toes
in
contentment
the
street
was
very
still
outside
he
murmured
on
why
should
your
mistress
decorate
you
with
an
article
most
necessary
to
her
at
all
times
anyway
at
most
times
how
did
she
come
to
slip
this
bit
of
silk
and
silver
about
your
neck
was
it
the
caprice
of
a
moment--when
you
before
you
had
lost
your
pristine
plumpness
marched
singing
into
her
bedroom
to
bid
her
good-morning
of
course
and
she
sat
up
among
the
pillows
her
coiled
hair
tumbling
to
her
shoulders
as
you
sprang
upon
the
bed
purring
'good-day
my
lady'
oh
it
is
very
easy
to
understand
he
yawned
resting
his
head
on
the
back
of
the
chair
the
cat
still
purred
tightening
and
relaxing
her
padded
claws
over
his
knee
shall
i
tell
you
all
about
her
cat
she
is
very
beautiful--your
mistress
he
murmured
drowsily
and
her
hair
is
heavy
as
burnished
gold
i
could
paint
her--not
on
canvas--for
i
should
need
shades
and
tones
and
hues
and
dyes
more
splendid
than
the
iris
of
a
splendid
rainbow
i
could
only
paint
her
with
closed
eyes
for
in
dreams
alone
can
such
colours
as
i
need
be
found
for
her
eyes
i
must
have
azure
from
skies
untroubled
by
a
cloud--the
skies
of
dreamland
for
her
lips
roses
from
the
palaces
of
slumberland
and
for
her
brow
snow-drifts
from
mountains
which
tower
in
fantastic
pinnacles
to
the
moons--oh
much
higher
than
our
moon
here--the
crystal
moons
of
dreamland
she
is--very--beautiful
your
mistress
the
words
died
on
his
lips
and
his
eyelids
drooped
the
cat
too
was
asleep
her
cheek
turned
up
upon
her
wasted
flank
her
paws
relaxed
and
limp
ii
it
is
fortunate
said
severn
sitting
up
and
stretching
that
we
have
tided
over
the
dinner
hour
for
i
have
nothing
to
offer
you
for
supper
but
what
may
be
purchased
with
one
silver
franc
the
cat
on
his
knee
rose
arched
her
back
yawned
and
looked
up
at
him
what
shall
it
be
a
roast
chicken
with
salad
no
possibly
you
prefer
beef
of
course--and
i
shall
try
an
egg
and
some
white
bread
now
for
the
wines
milk
for
you
good
i
shall
take
a
little
water
fresh
from
the
wood
with
a
motion
toward
the
bucket
in
the
sink
he
put
on
his
hat
and
left
the
room
the
cat
followed
to
the
door
and
after
he
had
closed
it
behind
him
she
settled
down
smelling
at
the
cracks
and
cocking
one
ear
at
every
creak
from
the
crazy
old
building
the
door
below
opened
and
shut
the
cat
looked
serious
for
a
moment
doubtful
and
her
ears
flattened
in
nervous
expectation
presently
she
rose
with
a
jerk
of
her
tail
and
started
on
a
noiseless
tour
of
the
studio
she
sneezed
at
a
pot
of
turpentine
hastily
retreating
to
the
table
which
she
presently
mounted
and
having
satisfied
her
curiosity
concerning
a
roll
of
red
modelling
wax
returned
to
the
door
and
sat
down
with
her
eyes
on
the
crack
over
the
threshold
then
she
lifted
her
voice
in
a
thin
plaint
when
severn
returned
he
looked
grave
but
the
cat
joyous
and
demonstrative
marched
around
him
rubbing
her
gaunt
body
against
his
legs
driving
her
head
enthusiastically
into
his
hand
and
purring
until
her
voice
mounted
to
a
squeal
he
placed
a
bit
of
meat
wrapped
in
brown
paper
upon
the
table
and
with
a
penknife
cut
it
into
shreds
the
milk
he
took
from
a
bottle
which
had
served
for
medicine
and
poured
it
into
the
saucer
on
the
hearth
the
cat
crouched
before
it
purring
and
lapping
at
the
same
time
he
cooked
his
egg
and
ate
it
with
a
slice
of
bread
watching
her
busy
with
the
shredded
meat
and
when
he
had
finished
and
had
filled
and
emptied
a
cup
of
water
from
the
bucket
in
the
sink
he
sat
down
taking
her
into
his
lap
where
she
at
once
curled
up
and
began
her
toilet
he
began
to
speak
again
touching
her
caressingly
at
times
by
way
of
emphasis
cat
i
have
found
out
where
your
mistress
lives
it
is
not
very
far
away--it
is
here
under
this
same
leaky
roof
but
in
the
north
wing
which
i
had
supposed
was
uninhabited
my
janitor
tells
me
this
by
chance
he
is
almost
sober
this
evening
the
butcher
on
the
rue
de
seine
where
i
bought
your
meat
knows
you
and
old
cabane
the
baker
identified
you
with
needless
sarcasm
they
tell
me
hard
tales
of
your
mistress
which
i
shall
not
believe
they
say
she
is
idle
and
vain
and
pleasure-loving
they
say
she
is
hare-brained
and
reckless
the
little
sculptor
on
the
ground
floor
who
was
buying
rolls
from
old
cabane
spoke
to
me
to-night
for
the
first
time
although
we
have
always
bowed
to
each
other
he
said
she
was
very
good
and
very
beautiful
he
has
only
seen
her
once
and
does
not
know
her
name
i
thanked
him--i
don't
know
why
i
thanked
him
so
warmly
cabane
said
'into
this
cursed
street
of
the
four
winds
the
four
winds
blow
all
things
evil'
the
sculptor
looked
confused
but
when
he
went
out
with
his
rolls
he
said
to
me
'i
am
sure
monsieur
that
she
is
as
good
as
she
is
beautiful'
the
cat
had
finished
her
toilet
and
now
springing
softly
to
the
floor
went
to
the
door
and
sniffed
he
knelt
beside
her
and
unclasping
the
garter
held
it
for
a
moment
in
his
hands
after
a
while
he
said
there
is
a
name
engraved
upon
the
silver
clasp
beneath
the
buckle
it
is
a
pretty
name
sylvia
elven
sylvia
is
a
woman's
name
elven
is
the
name
of
a
town
in
paris
in
this
quarter
above
all
in
this
street
of
the
four
winds
names
are
worn
and
put
away
as
the
fashions
change
with
the
seasons
i
know
the
little
town
of
elven
for
there
i
met
fate
face
to
face
and
fate
was
unkind
but
do
you
know
that
in
elven
fate
had
another
name
and
that
name
was
sylvia
he
replaced
the
garter
and
stood
up
looking
down
at
the
cat
crouched
before
the
closed
door
the
name
of
elven
has
a
charm
for
me
it
tells
me
of
meadows
and
clear
rivers
the
name
of
sylvia
troubles
me
like
perfume
from
dead
flowers
the
cat
mewed
yes
yes
he
said
soothingly
i
will
take
you
back
your
sylvia
is
not
my
sylvia
the
world
is
wide
and
elven
is
not
unknown
yet
in
the
darkness
and
filth
of
poorer
paris
in
the
sad
shadows
of
this
ancient
house
these
names
are
very
pleasant
to
me
he
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
strode
through
the
silent
corridors
to
the
stairs
down
five
flights
and
into
the
moonlit
court
past
the
little
sculptor's
den
and
then
again
in
at
the
gate
of
the
north
wing
and
up
the
worm-eaten
stairs
he
passed
until
he
came
to
a
closed
door
when
he
had
stood
knocking
for
a
long
time
something
moved
behind
the
door
it
opened
and
he
went
in
the
room
was
dark
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
the
cat
sprang
from
his
arms
into
the
shadows
he
listened
but
heard
nothing
the
silence
was
oppressive
and
he
struck
a
match
at
his
elbow
stood
a
table
and
on
the
table
a
candle
in
a
gilded
candlestick
this
he
lighted
then
looked
around
the
chamber
was
vast
the
hangings
heavy
with
embroidery
over
the
fireplace
towered
a
carved
mantel
grey
with
the
ashes
of
dead
fires
in
a
recess
by
the
deep-set
windows
stood
a
bed
from
which
the
bedclothes
soft
and
fine
as
lace
trailed
to
the
polished
floor
he
lifted
the
candle
above
his
head
a
handkerchief
lay
at
his
feet
it
was
faintly
perfumed
he
turned
toward
the
windows
in
front
of
them
was
a
canapã©
and
over
it
were
flung
pell-mell
a
gown
of
silk
a
heap
of
lace-like
garments
white
and
delicate
as
spiders'
meshes
long
crumpled
gloves
and
on
the
floor
beneath
the
stockings
the
little
pointed
shoes
and
one
garter
of
rosy
silk
quaintly
flowered
and
fitted
with
a
silver
clasp
wondering
he
stepped
forward
and
drew
the
heavy
curtains
from
the
bed
for
a
moment
the
candle
flared
in
his
hand
then
his
eyes
met
two
other
eyes
wide
open
smiling
and
the
candle-flame
flashed
over
hair
heavy
as
gold
she
was
pale
but
not
as
white
as
he
her
eyes
were
untroubled
as
a
child's
but
he
stared
trembling
from
head
to
foot
while
the
candle
flickered
in
his
hand
at
last
he
whispered
sylvia
it
is
i
again
he
said
it
is
i
then
knowing
that
she
was
dead
he
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
and
through
the
long
watches
of
the
night
the
cat
purred
on
his
knee
tightening
and
relaxing
her
padded
claws
until
the
sky
paled
above
the
street
of
the
four
winds
the
street
of
the
first
shell
be
of
good
cheer
the
sullen
month
will
die
and
a
young
moon
requite
us
by
and
by
look
how
the
old
one
meagre
bent
and
wan
with
age
and
fast
is
fainting
from
the
sky
the
room
was
already
dark
the
high
roofs
opposite
cut
off
what
little
remained
of
the
december
daylight
the
girl
drew
her
chair
nearer
the
window
and
choosing
a
large
needle
threaded
it
knotting
the
thread
over
her
fingers
then
she
smoothed
the
baby
garment
across
her
knees
and
bending
bit
off
the
thread
and
drew
the
smaller
needle
from
where
it
rested
in
the
hem
when
she
had
brushed
away
the
stray
threads
and
bits
of
lace
she
laid
it
again
over
her
knees
caressingly
then
she
slipped
the
threaded
needle
from
her
corsage
and
passed
it
through
a
button
but
as
the
button
spun
down
the
thread
her
hand
faltered
the
thread
snapped
and
the
button
rolled
across
the
floor
she
raised
her
head
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
strip
of
waning
light
above
the
chimneys
from
somewhere
in
the
city
came
sounds
like
the
distant
beating
of
drums
and
beyond
far
beyond
a
vague
muttering
now
growing
swelling
rumbling
in
the
distance
like
the
pounding
of
surf
upon
the
rocks
now
like
the
surf
again
receding
growling
menacing
the
cold
had
become
intense
a
bitter
piercing
cold
which
strained
and
snapped
at
joist
and
beam
and
turned
the
slush
of
yesterday
to
flint
from
the
street
below
every
sound
broke
sharp
and
metallic--the
clatter
of
sabots
the
rattle
of
shutters
or
the
rare
sound
of
a
human
voice
the
air
was
heavy
weighted
with
the
black
cold
as
with
a
pall
to
breathe
was
painful
to
move
an
effort
in
the
desolate
sky
there
was
something
that
wearied
in
the
brooding
clouds
something
that
saddened
it
penetrated
the
freezing
city
cut
by
the
freezing
river
the
splendid
city
with
its
towers
and
domes
its
quays
and
bridges
and
its
thousand
spires
it
entered
the
squares
it
seized
the
avenues
and
the
palaces
stole
across
bridges
and
crept
among
the
narrow
streets
of
the
latin
quarter
grey
under
the
grey
of
the
december
sky
sadness
utter
sadness
a
fine
icy
sleet
was
falling
powdering
the
pavement
with
a
tiny
crystalline
dust
it
sifted
against
the
window-panes
and
drifted
in
heaps
along
the
sill
the
light
at
the
window
had
nearly
failed
and
the
girl
bent
low
over
her
work
presently
she
raised
her
head
brushing
the
curls
from
her
eyes
jack
dearest
don't
forget
to
clean
your
palette
he
said
all
right
and
picking
up
the
palette
sat
down
upon
the
floor
in
front
of
the
stove
his
head
and
shoulders
were
in
the
shadow
but
the
firelight
fell
across
his
knees
and
glimmered
red
on
the
blade
of
the
palette-knife
full
in
the
firelight
beside
him
stood
a
colour-box
on
the
lid
was
carved
j
trent
ecole
des
beaux
arts
1870
this
inscription
was
ornamented
with
an
american
and
a
french
flag
the
sleet
blew
against
the
window-panes
covering
them
with
stars
and
diamonds
then
melting
from
the
warmer
air
within
ran
down
and
froze
again
in
fern-like
traceries
a
dog
whined
and
the
patter
of
small
paws
sounded
on
the
zinc
behind
the
stove
jack
dear
do
you
think
hercules
is
hungry
the
patter
of
paws
was
redoubled
behind
the
stove
he's
whining
she
continued
nervously
and
if
it
isn't
because
he's
hungry
it
is
because--
her
voice
faltered
a
loud
humming
filled
the
air
the
windows
vibrated
oh
jack
she
cried
another--
but
her
voice
was
drowned
in
the
scream
of
a
shell
tearing
through
the
clouds
overhead
that
is
the
nearest
yet
she
murmured
oh
no
he
answered
cheerfully
it
probably
fell
way
over
by
montmartre
and
as
she
did
not
answer
he
said
again
with
exaggerated
unconcern
they
wouldn't
take
the
trouble
to
fire
at
the
latin
quarter
anyway
they
haven't
a
battery
that
can
hurt
it
after
a
while
she
spoke
up
brightly
jack
dear
when
are
you
going
to
take
me
to
see
monsieur
west's
statues
i
will
bet
he
said
throwing
down
his
palette
and
walking
over
to
the
window
beside
her
that
colette
has
been
here
to-day
why
she
asked
opening
her
eyes
very
wide
then
oh
it's
too
bad--really
men
are
tiresome
when
they
think
they
know
everything
and
i
warn
you
that
if
monsieur
west
is
vain
enough
to
imagine
that
colette--
from
the
north
another
shell
came
whistling
and
quavering
through
the
sky
passing
above
them
with
long-drawn
screech
which
left
the
windows
singing
that
he
blurted
out
was
too
near
for
comfort
they
were
silent
for
a
while
then
he
spoke
again
gaily
go
on
sylvia
and
wither
poor
west
but
she
only
sighed
oh
dear
i
can
never
seem
to
get
used
to
the
shells
he
sat
down
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
beside
her
her
scissors
fell
jingling
to
the
floor
she
tossed
the
unfinished
frock
after
them
and
putting
both
arms
about
his
neck
drew
him
down
into
her
lap
don't
go
out
to-night
jack
he
kissed
her
uplifted
face
you
know
i
must
don't
make
it
hard
for
me
but
when
i
hear
the
shells
and--and
know
you
are
out
in
the
city--
but
they
all
fall
in
montmartre--
they
may
all
fall
in
the
beaux
arts
you
said
yourself
that
two
struck
the
quai
d'orsay--
mere
accident--
jack
have
pity
on
me
take
me
with
you
and
who
will
there
be
to
get
dinner
she
rose
and
flung
herself
on
the
bed
oh
i
can't
get
used
to
it
and
i
know
you
must
go
but
i
beg
you
not
to
be
late
to
dinner
if
you
knew
what
i
suffer
i--i--cannot
help
it
and
you
must
be
patient
with
me
dear
he
said
it
is
as
safe
there
as
it
is
in
our
own
house
she
watched
him
fill
for
her
the
alcohol
lamp
and
when
he
had
lighted
it
and
had
taken
his
hat
to
go
she
jumped
up
and
clung
to
him
in
silence
after
a
moment
he
said
now
sylvia
remember
my
courage
is
sustained
by
yours
come
i
must
go
she
did
not
move
and
he
repeated
i
must
go
then
she
stepped
back
and
he
thought
she
was
going
to
speak
and
waited
but
she
only
looked
at
him
and
a
little
impatiently
he
kissed
her
again
saying
don't
worry
dearest
when
he
had
reached
the
last
flight
of
stairs
on
his
way
to
the
street
a
woman
hobbled
out
of
the
house-keeper's
lodge
waving
a
letter
and
calling
monsieur
jack
monsieur
jack
this
was
left
by
monsieur
fallowby
he
took
the
letter
and
leaning
on
the
threshold
of
the
lodge
read
it
dear
jack
i
believe
braith
is
dead
broke
and
i'm
sure
fallowby
is
braith
swears
he
isn't
and
fallowby
swears
he
is
so
you
can
draw
your
own
conclusions
i've
got
a
scheme
for
a
dinner
and
if
it
works
i
will
let
you
fellows
in
yours
faithfully
west
ps--fallowby
has
shaken
hartman
and
his
gang
thank
the
lord
there
is
something
rotten
there--or
it
may
be
he's
only
a
miser
pps--i'm
more
desperately
in
love
than
ever
but
i'm
sure
she
does
not
care
a
straw
for
me
all
right
said
trent
with
a
smile
to
the
concierge
but
tell
me
how
is
papa
cottard
the
old
woman
shook
her
head
and
pointed
to
the
curtained
bed
in
the
lodge
pã¨re
cottard
he
cried
cheerily
how
goes
the
wound
to-day
he
walked
over
to
the
bed
and
drew
the
curtains
an
old
man
was
lying
among
the
tumbled
sheets
better
smiled
trent
better
repeated
the
man
wearily
and
after
a
pause
have
you
any
news
monsieur
jack
i
haven't
been
out
to-day
i
will
bring
you
any
rumour
i
may
hear
though
goodness
knows
i've
got
enough
of
rumours
he
muttered
to
himself
then
aloud
cheer
up
you're
looking
better
and
the
sortie
oh
the
sortie
that's
for
this
week
general
trochu
sent
orders
last
night
it
will
be
terrible
it
will
be
sickening
thought
trent
as
he
went
not
into
the
street
and
turned
the
corner
toward
the
rue
de
seine
slaughter
slaughter
phew
i'm
glad
i'm
not
going
the
street
was
almost
deserted
a
few
women
muffled
in
tattered
military
capes
crept
along
the
frozen
pavement
and
a
wretchedly
clad
gamin
hovered
over
the
sewer-hole
on
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
a
rope
around
his
waist
held
his
rags
together
from
the
rope
hung
a
rat
still
warm
and
bleeding
there's
another
in
there
he
yelled
at
trent
i
hit
him
but
he
got
away
trent
crossed
the
street
and
asked
how
much
two
francs
for
a
quarter
of
a
fat
one
that's
what
they
give
at
the
st
germain
market
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
interrupted
him
but
he
wiped
his
face
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
looked
cunningly
at
trent
last
week
you
could
buy
a
rat
for
six
francs
but
and
here
he
swore
vilely
the
rats
have
quit
the
rue
de
seine
and
they
kill
them
now
over
by
the
new
hospital
i'll
let
you
have
this
for
seven
francs
i
can
sell
it
for
ten
in
the
isle
st
louis
you
lie
said
trent
and
let
me
tell
you
that
if
you
try
to
swindle
anybody
in
this
quarter
the
people
will
make
short
work
of
you
and
your
rats
he
stood
a
moment
eyeing
the
gamin
who
pretended
to
snivel
then
he
tossed
him
a
franc
laughing
the
child
caught
it
and
thrusting
it
into
his
mouth
wheeled
about
to
the
sewer-hole
for
a
second
he
crouched
motionless
alert
his
eyes
on
the
bars
of
the
drain
then
leaping
forward
he
hurled
a
stone
into
the
gutter
and
trent
left
him
to
finish
a
fierce
grey
rat
that
writhed
squealing
at
the
mouth
of
the
sewer
suppose
braith
should
come
to
that
he
thought
poor
little
chap
and
hurrying
he
turned
in
the
dirty
passage
des
beaux
arts
and
entered
the
third
house
to
the
left
monsieur
is
at
home
quavered
the
old
concierge
home
a
garret
absolutely
bare
save
for
the
iron
bedstead
in
the
corner
and
the
iron
basin
and
pitcher
on
the
floor
west
appeared
at
the
door
winking
with
much
mystery
and
motioned
trent
to
enter
braith
who
was
painting
in
bed
to
keep
warm
looked
up
laughed
and
shook
hands
any
news
the
perfunctory
question
was
answered
as
usual
by
nothing
but
the
cannon
trent
sat
down
on
the
bed
where
on
earth
did
you
get
that
he
demanded
pointing
to
a
half-finished
chicken
nestling
in
a
wash-basin
west
grinned
are
you
millionaires
you
two
out
with
it
braith
looking
a
little
ashamed
began
oh
it's
one
of
west's
exploits
but
was
cut
short
by
west
who
said
he
would
tell
the
story
himself
you
see
before
the
siege
i
had
a
letter
of
introduction
to
a
'type'
here
a
fat
banker
german-american
variety
you
know
the
species
i
see
well
of
course
i
forgot
to
present
the
letter
but
this
morning
judging
it
to
be
a
favourable
opportunity
i
called
on
him
the
villain
lives
in
comfort--fires
my
boy--fires
in
the
ante-rooms
the
buttons
finally
condescends
to
carry
my
letter
and
card
up
leaving
me
standing
in
the
hallway
which
i
did
not
like
so
i
entered
the
first
room
i
saw
and
nearly
fainted
at
the
sight
of
a
banquet
on
a
table
by
the
fire
down
comes
buttons
very
insolent
no
oh
no
his
master
'is
not
at
home
and
in
fact
is
too
busy
to
receive
letters
of
introduction
just
now
the
siege
and
many
business
difficulties--'
i
deliver
a
kick
to
buttons
pick
up
this
chicken
from
the
table
toss
my
card
on
to
the
empty
plate
and
addressing
buttons
as
a
species
of
prussian
pig
march
out
with
the
honours
of
war
trent
shook
his
head
i
forgot
to
say
that
hartman
often
dines
there
and
i
draw
my
own
conclusions
continued
west
now
about
this
chicken
half
of
it
is
for
braith
and
myself
and
half
for
colette
but
of
course
you
will
help
me
eat
my
part
because
i'm
not
hungry
neither
am
i
began
braith
but
trent
with
a
smile
at
the
pinched
faces
before
him
shook
his
head
saying
what
nonsense
you
know
i'm
never
hungry
west
hesitated
reddened
and
then
slicing
off
braith's
portion
but
not
eating
any
himself
said
good-night
and
hurried
away
to
number
470
rue
serpente
where
lived
a
pretty
girl
named
colette
orphan
after
sedan
and
heaven
alone
knew
where
she
got
the
roses
in
her
cheeks
for
the
siege
came
hard
on
the
poor
that
chicken
will
delight
her
but
i
really
believe
she's
in
love
with
west
said
trent
then
walking
over
to
the
bed
see
here
old
man
no
dodging
you
know
how
much
have
you
left
the
other
hesitated
and
flushed
come
old
chap
insisted
trent
braith
drew
a
purse
from
beneath
his
bolster
and
handed
it
to
his
friend
with
a
simplicity
that
touched
him
seven
sons
he
counted
you
make
me
tired
why
on
earth
don't
you
come
to
me
i
take
it
d----d
ill
braith
how
many
times
must
i
go
over
the
same
thing
and
explain
to
you
that
because
i
have
money
it
is
my
duty
to
share
it
and
your
duty
and
the
duty
of
every
american
to
share
it
with
me
you
can't
get
a
cent
the
city's
blockaded
and
the
american
minister
has
his
hands
full
with
all
the
german
riff-raff
and
deuce
knows
what
why
don't
you
act
sensibly
i--i
will
trent
but
it's
an
obligation
that
perhaps
i
can
never
even
in
part
repay
i'm
poor
and--
of
course
you'll
pay
me
if
i
were
a
usurer
i
would
take
your
talent
for
security
when
you
are
rich
and
famous--
don't
trent--
all
right
only
no
more
monkey
business
he
slipped
a
dozen
gold
pieces
into
the
purse
and
tucking
it
again
under
the
mattress
smiled
at
braith
how
old
are
you
he
demanded
sixteen
trent
laid
his
hand
lightly
on
his
friend's
shoulder
i'm
twenty-two
and
i
have
the
rights
of
a
grandfather
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
you'll
do
as
i
say
until
you're
twenty-one
the
siã¨ge
will
be
over
then
i
hope
said
braith
trying
to
laugh
but
the
prayer
in
their
hearts
how
long
o
lord
how
long
was
answered
by
the
swift
scream
of
a
shell
soaring
among
the
storm-clouds
of
that
december
night
ii
west
standing
in
the
doorway
of
a
house
in
the
rue
serpentine
was
speaking
angrily
he
said
he
didn't
care
whether
hartman
liked
it
or
not
he
was
telling
him
not
arguing
with
him
you
call
yourself
an
american
he
sneered
berlin
and
hell
are
full
of
that
kind
of
american
you
come
loafing
about
colette
with
your
pockets
stuffed
with
white
bread
and
beef
and
a
bottle
of
wine
at
thirty
francs
and
you
can't
really
afford
to
give
a
dollar
to
the
american
ambulance
and
public
assistance
which
braith
does
and
he's
half
starved
hartman
retreated
to
the
curbstone
but
west
followed
him
his
face
like
a
thunder-cloud
don't
you
dare
to
call
yourself
a
countryman
of
mine
he
growled--no--nor
an
artist
either
artists
don't
worm
themselves
into
the
service
of
the
public
defence
where
they
do
nothing
but
feed
like
rats
on
the
people's
food
and
i'll
tell
you
now
he
continued
dropping
his
voice
for
hartman
had
started
as
though
stung
you
might
better
keep
away
from
that
alsatian
brasserie
and
the
smug-faced
thieves
who
haunt
it
you
know
what
they
do
with
suspects
you
lie
you
hound
screamed
hartman
and
flung
the
bottle
in
his
hand
straight
at
west's
face
west
had
him
by
the
throat
in
a
second
and
forcing
him
against
the
dead
wall
shook
him
wickedly
now
you
listen
to
me
he
muttered
through
his
clenched
teeth
you
are
already
a
suspect
and--i
swear--i
believe
you
are
a
paid
spy
it
isn't
my
business
to
detect
such
vermin
and
i
don't
intend
to
denounce
you
but
understand
this
colette
don't
like
you
and
i
can't
stand
you
and
if
i
catch
you
in
this
street
again
i'll
make
it
somewhat
unpleasant
get
out
you
sleek
prussian
hartman
had
managed
to
drag
a
knife
from
his
pocket
but
west
tore
it
from
him
and
hurled
him
into
the
gutter
a
gamin
who
had
seen
this
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
which
rattled
harshly
in
the
silent
street
then
everywhere
windows
were
raised
and
rows
of
haggard
faces
appeared
demanding
to
know
why
people
should
laugh
in
the
starving
city
is
it
a
victory
murmured
one
look
at
that
cried
west
as
hartman
picked
himself
up
from
the
pavement
look
you
miser
look
at
those
faces
but
hartman
gave
him
a
look
which
he
never
forgot
and
walked
away
without
a
word
trent
who
suddenly
appeared
at
the
corner
glanced
curiously
at
west
who
merely
nodded
toward
his
door
saying
come
in
fallowby's
upstairs
what
are
you
doing
with
that
knife
demanded
fallowby
as
he
and
trent
entered
the
studio
west
looked
at
his
wounded
hand
which
still
clutched
the
knife
but
saying
cut
myself
by
accident
tossed
it
into
a
corner
and
washed
the
blood
from
his
fingers
fallowby
fat
and
lazy
watched
him
without
comment
but
trent
half
divining
how
things
had
turned
walked
over
to
fallowby
smiling
i've
a
bone
to
pick
with
you
he
said
where
is
it
i'm
hungry
replied
fallowby
with
affected
eagerness
but
trent
frowning
told
him
to
listen
how
much
did
i
advance
you
a
week
ago
three
hundred
and
eighty
francs
replied
the
other
with
a
squirm
of
contrition
where
is
it
fallowby
began
a
series
of
intricate
explanations
which
were
soon
cut
short
by
trent
i
know
you
blew
it
in--you
always
blow
it
in
i
don't
care
a
rap
what
you
did
before
the
siege
i
know
you
are
rich
and
have
a
right
to
dispose
of
your
money
as
you
wish
to
and
i
also
know
that
generally
speaking
it
is
none
of
my
business
but
now
it
is
my
business
as
i
have
to
supply
the
funds
until
you
get
some
more
which
you
won't
until
the
siege
is
ended
one
way
or
another
i
wish
to
share
what
i
have
but
i
won't
see
it
thrown
out
of
the
window
oh
yes
of
course
i
know
you
will
reimburse
me
but
that
isn't
the
question
and
anyway
it's
the
opinion
of
your
friends
old
man
that
you
will
not
be
worse
off
for
a
little
abstinence
from
fleshly
pleasures
you
are
positively
a
freak
in
this
famine-cursed
city
of
skeletons
i
am
rather
stout
he
admitted
is
it
true
you
are
out
of
money
demanded
trent
yes
i
am
sighed
the
other
that
roast
sucking
pig
on
the
rue
st
honorã©--is
it
there
yet
continued
trent
wh--at
stammered
the
feeble
one
ah--i
thought
so
i
caught
you
in
ecstasy
before
that
sucking
pig
at
least
a
dozen
times
then
laughing
he
presented
fallowby
with
a
roll
of
twenty
franc
pieces
saying
if
these
go
for
luxuries
you
must
live
on
your
own
flesh
and
went
over
to
aid
west
who
sat
beside
the
wash-basin
binding
up
his
hand
west
suffered
him
to
tie
the
knot
and
then
said
you
remember
yesterday
when
i
left
you
and
braith
to
take
the
chicken
to
colette
chicken
good
heavens
moaned
fallowby
chicken
repeated
west
enjoying
fallowby's
grief--i--that
is
i
must
explain
that
things
are
changed
colette
and
i--are
to
be
married--
what--what
about
the
chicken
groaned
fallowby
shut
up
laughed
trent
and
slipping
his
arm
through
west's
walked
to
the
stairway
the
poor
little
thing
said
west
just
think
not
a
splinter
of
firewood
for
a
week
and
wouldn't
tell
me
because
she
thought
i
needed
it
for
my
clay
figure
whew
when
i
heard
it
i
smashed
that
smirking
clay
nymph
to
pieces
and
the
rest
can
freeze
and
be
hanged
after
a
moment
he
added
timidly
won't
you
call
on
your
way
down
and
say
bon
soir
it's
no
17
yes
said
trent
and
he
went
out
softly
closing
the
door
behind
he
stopped
on
the
third
landing
lighted
a
match
scanned
the
numbers
over
the
row
of
dingy
doors
and
knocked
at
no
17
c'est
toi
georges
the
door
opened
oh
pardon
monsieur
jack
i
thought
it
was
monsieur
west
then
blushing
furiously
oh
i
see
you
have
heard
oh
thank
you
so
much
for
your
wishes
and
i'm
sure
we
love
each
other
very
much--and
i'm
dying
to
see
sylvia
and
tell
her
and--
and
what
laughed
trent
i
am
very
happy
she
sighed
he's
pure
gold
returned
trent
and
then
gaily
i
want
you
and
george
to
come
and
dine
with
us
to-night
it's
a
little
treat--you
see
to-morrow
is
sylvia's
fãªte
she
will
be
nineteen
i
have
written
to
thorne
and
the
guernalecs
will
come
with
their
cousin
odile
fallowby
has
engaged
not
to
bring
anybody
but
himself
the
girl
accepted
shyly
charging
him
with
loads
of
loving
messages
to
sylvia
and
he
said
good-night
he
started
up
the
street
walking
swiftly
for
it
was
bitter
cold
and
cutting
across
the
rue
de
la
lune
he
entered
the
rue
de
seine
the
early
winter
night
had
fallen
almost
without
warning
but
the
sky
was
clear
and
myriads
of
stars
glittered
in
the
heavens
the
bombardment
had
become
furious--a
steady
rolling
thunder
from
the
prussian
cannon
punctuated
by
the
heavy
shocks
from
mont
valã©rien
the
shells
streamed
across
the
sky
leaving
trails
like
shooting
stars
and
now
as
he
turned
to
look
back
rockets
blue
and
red
flared
above
the
horizon
from
the
fort
of
issy
and
the
fortress
of
the
north
flamed
like
a
bonfire
good
news
a
man
shouted
over
by
the
boulevard
st
germain
as
if
by
magic
the
streets
were
filled
with
people--shivering
chattering
people
with
shrunken
eyes
jacques
cried
one
the
army
of
the
loire
eh
mon
vieux
it
has
come
then
at
last
i
told
thee
i
told
thee
to-morrow--to-night--who
knows
is
it
true
is
it
a
sortie
some
one
said
oh
god--a
sortie--and
my
son
another
cried
to
the
seine
they
say
one
can
see
the
signals
of
the
army
of
the
loire
from
the
pont
neuf
there
was
a
child
standing
near
trent
who
kept
repeating
mamma
mamma
then
to-morrow
we
may
eat
white
bread
and
beside
him
an
old
man
swaying
stumbling
his
shrivelled
hands
crushed
to
his
breast
muttering
as
if
insane
could
it
be
true
who
has
heard
the
news
the
shoemaker
on
the
rue
de
buci
had
it
from
a
mobile
who
had
heard
a
franctireur
repeat
it
to
a
captain
of
the
national
guard
trent
followed
the
throng
surging
through
the
rue
de
seine
to
the
river
rocket
after
rocket
clove
the
sky
and
now
from
montmartre
the
cannon
clanged
and
the
batteries
on
montparnasse
joined
in
with
a
crash
the
bridge
was
packed
with
people
trent
asked
who
has
seen
the
signals
of
the
army
of
the
loire
we
are
waiting
for
them
was
the
reply
he
looked
toward
the
north
suddenly
the
huge
silhouette
of
the
arc
de
triomphe
sprang
into
black
relief
against
the
flash
of
a
cannon
the
boom
of
the
gun
rolled
along
the
quay
and
the
old
bridge
vibrated
again
over
by
the
point
du
jour
a
flash
and
heavy
explosion
shook
the
bridge
and
then
the
whole
eastern
bastion
of
the
fortifications
blazed
and
crackled
sending
a
red
flame
into
the
sky
has
any
one
seen
the
signals
yet
he
asked
again
we
are
waiting
was
the
reply
yes
waiting
murmured
a
man
behind
him
waiting
sick
starved
freezing
but
waiting
is
it
a
sortie
they
go
gladly
is
it
to
starve
they
starve
they
have
no
time
to
think
of
surrender
are
they
heroes--these
parisians
answer
me
trent
the
american
ambulance
surgeon
turned
about
and
scanned
the
parapets
of
the
bridge
any
news
doctor
asked
trent
mechanically
news
said
the
doctor
i
don't
know
any--i
haven't
time
to
know
any
what
are
these
people
after
they
say
that
the
army
of
the
loire
has
signalled
mont
valã©rien
poor
devils
the
doctor
glanced
about
him
for
an
instant
and
then
i'm
so
harried
and
worried
that
i
don't
know
what
to
do
after
the
last
sortie
we
had
the
work
of
fifty
ambulances
on
our
poor
little
corps
to-morrow
there's
another
sortie
and
i
wish
you
fellows
could
come
over
to
headquarters
we
may
need
volunteers
how
is
madame
he
added
abruptly
well
replied
trent
but
she
seems
to
grow
more
nervous
every
day
i
ought
to
be
with
her
now
take
care
of
her
said
the
doctor
then
with
a
sharp
look
at
the
people
i
can't
stop
now--goodnight
and
he
hurried
away
muttering
poor
devils
trent
leaned
over
the
parapet
and
blinked
at
the
black
river
surging
through
the
arches
dark
objects
carried
swiftly
on
the
breast
of
the
current
struck
with
a
grinding
tearing
noise
against
the
stone
piers
spun
around
for
an
instant
and
hurried
away
into
the
darkness
the
ice
from
the
marne
as
he
stood
staring
into
the
water
a
hand
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
hello
southwark
he
cried
turning
around
this
is
a
queer
place
for
you
trent
i
have
something
to
tell
you
don't
stay
here--don't
believe
in
the
army
of
the
loire
and
the
attachã©
of
the
american
legation
slipped
his
arm
through
trent's
and
drew
him
toward
the
louvre
then
it's
another
lie
said
trent
bitterly
worse--we
know
at
the
legation--i
can't
speak
of
it
but
that's
not
what
i
have
to
say
something
happened
this
afternoon
the
alsatian
brasserie
was
visited
and
an
american
named
hartman
has
been
arrested
do
you
know
him
i
know
a
german
who
calls
himself
an
american--his
name
is
hartman
well
he
was
arrested
about
two
hours
ago
they
mean
to
shoot
him
what
of
course
we
at
the
legation
can't
allow
them
to
shoot
him
off-hand
but
the
evidence
seems
conclusive
is
he
a
spy
well
the
papers
seized
in
his
rooms
are
pretty
damning
proofs
and
besides
he
was
caught
they
say
swindling
the
public
food
committee
he
drew
rations
for
fifty
how
i
don't
know
he
claims
to
be
an
american
artist
here
and
we
have
been
obliged
to
take
notice
of
it
at
the
legation
it's
a
nasty
affair
to
cheat
the
people
at
such
a
time
is
worse
than
robbing
the
poor-box
cried
trent
angrily
let
them
shoot
him
he's
an
american
citizen
yes
oh
yes
said
the
other
with
bitterness
american
citizenship
is
a
precious
privilege
when
every
goggle-eyed
german--
his
anger
choked
him
southwark
shook
hands
with
him
warmly
it
can't
be
helped
we
must
own
the
carrion
i
am
afraid
you
may
be
called
upon
to
identify
him
as
an
american
artist
he
said
with
a
ghost
of
a
smile
on
his
deep-lined
face
and
walked
away
through
the
cours
la
reine
trent
swore
silently
for
a
moment
and
then
drew
out
his
watch
seven
o'clock
sylvia
will
be
anxious
he
thought
and
hurried
back
to
the
river
the
crowd
still
huddled
shivering
on
the
bridge
a
sombre
pitiful
congregation
peering
out
into
the
night
for
the
signals
of
the
army
of
the
loire
and
their
hearts
beat
time
to
the
pounding
of
the
guns
their
eyes
lighted
with
each
flash
from
the
bastions
and
hope
rose
with
the
drifting
rockets
a
black
cloud
hung
over
the
fortifications
from
horizon
to
horizon
the
cannon
smoke
stretched
in
wavering
bands
now
capping
the
spires
and
domes
with
cloud
now
blowing
in
streamers
and
shreds
along
the
streets
now
descending
from
the
housetops
enveloping
quays
bridges
and
river
in
a
sulphurous
mist
and
through
the
smoke
pall
the
lightning
of
the
cannon
played
while
from
time
to
time
a
rift
above
showed
a
fathomless
black
vault
set
with
stars
he
turned
again
into
the
rue
de
seine
that
sad
abandoned
street
with
its
rows
of
closed
shutters
and
desolate
ranks
of
unlighted
lamps
he
was
a
little
nervous
and
wished
once
or
twice
for
a
revolver
but
the
slinking
forms
which
passed
him
in
the
darkness
were
too
weak
with
hunger
to
be
dangerous
he
thought
and
he
passed
on
unmolested
to
his
doorway
but
there
somebody
sprang
at
his
throat
over
and
over
the
icy
pavement
he
rolled
with
his
assailant
tearing
at
the
noose
about
his
neck
and
then
with
a
wrench
sprang
to
his
feet
get
up
he
cried
to
the
other
slowly
and
with
great
deliberation
a
small
gamin
picked
himself
out
of
the
gutter
and
surveyed
trent
with
disgust
that's
a
nice
clean
trick
said
trent
a
whelp
of
your
age
you'll
finish
against
a
dead
wall
give
me
that
cord
the
urchin
handed
him
the
noose
without
a
word
trent
struck
a
match
and
looked
at
his
assailant
it
was
the
rat-killer
of
the
day
before
h'm
i
thought
so
he
muttered
tiens
c'est
toi
said
the
gamin
tranquilly
the
impudence
the
overpowering
audacity
of
the
ragamuffin
took
trent's
breath
away
do
you
know
you
young
strangler
he
gasped
that
they
shoot
thieves
of
your
age
the
child
turned
a
passionless
face
to
trent
shoot
then
that
was
too
much
and
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
entered
his
hotel
groping
up
the
unlighted
stairway
he
at
last
reached
his
own
landing
and
felt
about
in
the
darkness
for
the
door
from
his
studio
came
the
sound
of
voices
west's
hearty
laugh
and
fallowby's
chuckle
and
at
last
he
found
the
knob
and
pushing
back
the
door
stood
a
moment
confused
by
the
light
hello
jack
cried
west
you're
a
pleasant
creature
inviting
people
to
dine
and
letting
them
wait
here's
fallowby
weeping
with
hunger--
shut
up
observed
the
latter
perhaps
he's
been
out
to
buy
a
turkey
he's
been
out
garroting
look
at
his
noose

guernalec

shook
hands
with
everybody
and
laughed
at
sylvia's
pale
face
i
didn't
mean
to
be
late
i
stopped
on
the
bridge
a
moment
to
watch
the
bombardment
were
you
anxious
sylvia
she
smiled
and
murmured
oh
no
but
her
hand
dropped
into
his
and
tightened
convulsively
to
the
table
shouted
fallowby
and
uttered
a
joyous
whoop
take
it
easy
observed
thorne
with
a
remnant
of
manners
you
are
not
the
host
you
know
marie
guernalec
who
had
been
chattering
with
colette
jumped
up
and
took
thorne's
arm
and
monsieur
guernalec
drew
odile's
arm
through
his
trent
bowing
gravely
offered
his
own
arm
to
colette
west
took
in
sylvia
and
fallowby
hovered
anxiously
in
the
rear
you
march
around
the
table
three
times
singing
the
marseillaise
explained
sylvia
and
monsieur
fallowby
pounds
on
the
table
and
beats
time
fallowby
suggested
that
they
could
sing
after
dinner
but
his
protest
was
drowned
in
the
ringing
chorus--
aux

formez
vos
bataillons
around
the
room
they
marched
singing
marchons
marchons
with
all
their
might
while
fallowby
with
very
bad
grace
hammered
on
the
table
consoling
himself
a
little
with
the
hope
that
the
exercise
would
increase
his
appetite
hercules
the
black
and

fled
under
the
bed
from
which
retreat
he
yapped
and
whined
until
dragged
out
by
guernalec
and
placed
in
odile's
lap
and
now
said

gravely
when
everybody

sighed
odile
marie

sipped
her

in
rapture
not
at
all

i
don't
care
what
they

doesn't
taste
like

whispered
colette
to

fallowby
who
had
finished
began
to
caress
his
chin
and
eye
the

have
some
more
old
chap
inquired
trent
monsieur
fallowby
cannot
have
any
more
announced
sylvia
i
am
saving
this
for
the

fallowby
transferred
his
eyes
to
the
fish
the
sardines
hot
from
the
grille
were
a
great
success
while
the
others
were
eating
sylvia
ran
downstairs
with
the
soup
for
the
old
concierge
and
her
husband
and
when
she
hurried
back
flushed
and
breathless
and
had
slipped
into
her
chair
with
a
happy
smile
at
trent
that
young
man
arose
and
silence
fell
over
the
table
for
an
instant
he
looked
at
sylvia
and
thought
he
had
never
seen
her
so
beautiful
you
all
know
he
began
that
to-day
is
my
wife's
nineteenth
birthday--
fallowby
bubbling
with
enthusiasm
waved
his
glass
in
circles
about
his
head
to
the
terror
of
odile
and
colette
his
neighbours
and
thorne
west
and
guernalec
refilled
their
glasses
three
times
before
the
storm
of
applause
which
the
toast
of
sylvia
had
provoked
subsided
three
times
the
glasses
were
filled
and
emptied
to
sylvia
and
again
to
trent
who
protested
this
is
irregular
he
cried
the
next
toast
is
to
the
twin
republics
france
and
america
to
the
republics
to
the
republics
they
cried
and
the
toast
was
drunk
amid
shouts
of
vive
a
france
vive
l'amã©rique
vive
la
nation
then
trent
with
a
smile
at
west
offered
the
toast
to
a
happy
pair
and
everybody
understood
and
sylvia
leaned
over
and
kissed
colette
while
trent
bowed
to
west
the
beef
was
eaten
in
comparative
calm
but
when
it
was
finished
and
a
portion
of
it
set
aside
for
the
old
people
below
trent
cried
drink
to
paris
may
she
rise
from
her
ruins
and
crush
the
invader
and
the
cheers
rang
out
drowning
for
a
moment
the
monotonous
thunder
of
the
prussian
guns
pipes
and
cigarettes
were
lighted
and
trent
listened
an
instant
to
the
animated
chatter
around
him
broken
by
ripples
of
laughter
from
the
girls
or
the
mellow
chuckle
of
fallowby
then
he
turned
to
west
there
is
going
to
be
a
sortie
to-night
he
said
i
saw
the
american
ambulance
surgeon
just
before
i
came
in
and
he
asked
me
to
speak
to
you
fellows
any
aid
we
can
give
him
will
not
come
amiss
then
dropping
his
voice
and
speaking
in
english
as
for
me
i
shall
go
out
with
the
ambulance
to-morrow
morning
there
is
of
course
no
danger
but
it's
just
as
well
to
keep
it
from
sylvia
west
nodded
thorne
and
guernalec
who
had
heard
broke
in
and
offered
assistance
and
fallowby
volunteered
with
a
groan
all
right
said
trent
rapidly--no
more
now
but
meet
me
at
ambulance
headquarters
to-morrow
morning
at
eight
sylvia
and
colette
who
were
becoming
uneasy
at
the
conversation
in
english
now
demanded
to
know
what
they
were
talking
about
what
does
a
sculptor
usually
talk
about
cried
west
with
a
laugh
odile
glanced
reproachfully
at
thorne
her
fiancã©
you
are
not
french
you
know
and
it
is
none
of
your
business
this
war
said
odile
with
much
dignity
thorne
looked
meek
but
west
assumed
an
air
of
outraged
virtue
it
seems
he
said
to
fallowby
that
a
fellow
cannot
discuss
the
beauties
of
greek
sculpture
in
his
mother
tongue
without
being
openly
suspected
colette
placed
her
hand
over
his
mouth
and
turning
to
sylvia
murmured
they
are
horridly
untruthful
these
men
i
believe
the
word
for
ambulance
is
the
same
in
both
languages
said
marie
guernalec
saucily
sylvia
don't
trust
monsieur
trent
jack
whispered
sylvia
promise
me--
a
knock
at
the
studio
door
interrupted
her
come
in
cried
fallowby
but
trent
sprang
up
and
opening
the
door
looked
out
then
with
a
hasty
excuse
to
the
rest
he
stepped
into
the
hall-way
and
closed
the
door
when
he
returned
he
was
grumbling
what
is
it
jack
cried
west
what
is
it
repeated
trent
savagely
i'll
tell
you
what
it
is
i
have
received
a
dispatch
from
the
american
minister
to
go
at
once
and
identify
and
claim
as
a
fellow-countryman
and
a
brother
artist
a
rascally
thief
and
a
german
spy
don't
go
suggested
fallowby
if
i
don't
they'll
shoot
him
at
once
let
them
growled
thorne
do
you
fellows
know
who
it
is
hartman
shouted
west
inspired
sylvia
sprang
up
deathly
white
but
odile
slipped
her
arm
around
her
and
supported
her
to
a
chair
saying
calmly
sylvia
has
fainted--it's
the
hot
room--bring
some
water
trent
brought
it
at
once
sylvia
opened
her
eyes
and
after
a
moment
rose
and
supported
by
marie
guernalec
and
trent
passed
into
the
bedroom
it
was
the
signal
for
breaking
up
and
everybody
came
and
shook
hands
with
trent
saying
they
hoped
sylvia
would
sleep
it
off
and
that
it
would
be
nothing
when
marie
guernalec
took
leave
of
him
she
avoided
his
eyes
but
he
spoke
to
her
cordially
and
thanked
her
for
her
aid
anything
i
can
do
jack
inquired
west
lingering
and
then
hurried
downstairs
to
catch
up
with
the
rest
trent
leaned
over
the
banisters
listening
to
their
footsteps
and
chatter
and
then
the
lower
door
banged
and
the
house
was
silent
he
lingered
staring
down
into
the
blackness
biting
his
lips
then
with
an
impatient
movement
i
am
crazy
he
muttered
and
lighting
a
candle
went
into
the
bedroom
sylvia
was
lying
on
the
bed
he
bent
over
her
smoothing
the
curly
hair
on
her
forehead
are
you
better
dear
sylvia
she
did
not
answer
but
raised
her
eyes
to
his
for
an
instant
he
met
her
gaze
but
what
he
read
there
sent
a
chill
to
his
heart
and
he
sat
down
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
at
last
she
spoke
in
a
voice
changed
and
strained--a
voice
which
he
had
never
heard
and
he
dropped
his
hands
and
listened
bolt
upright
in
his
chair
jack
it
has
come
at
last
i
have
feared
it
and
trembled--ah
how
often
have
i
lain
awake
at
night
with
this
on
my
heart
and
prayed
that
i
might
die
before
you
should
ever
know
of
it
for
i
love
you
jack
and
if
you
go
away
i
cannot
live
i
have
deceived
you--it
happened
before
i
knew
you
but
since
that
first
day
when
you
found
me
weeping
in
the
luxembourg
and
spoke
to
me
jack
i
have
been
faithful
to
you
in
every
thought
and
deed
i
loved
you
from
the
first
and
did
not
dare
to
tell
you
this--fearing
that
you
would
go
away
and
since
then
my
love
has
grown--grown--and
oh
i
suffered--but
i
dared
not
tell
you
and
now
you
know
but
you
do
not
know
the
worst
for
him--now--what
do
i
care
he
was
cruel--oh
so
cruel
she
hid
her
face
in
her
arms
must
i
go
on
must
i
tell
you--can
you
not
imagine
oh
jack--
he
did
not
stir
his
eyes
seemed
dead
i--i
was
so
young
i
knew
nothing
and
he
said--said
that
he
loved
me--
trent
rose
and
struck
the
candle
with
his
clenched
fist
and
the
room
was
dark
the
bells
of
st
sulpice
tolled
the
hour
and
she
started
up
speaking
with
feverish
haste--i
must
finish
when
you
told
me
you
loved
me--you--you
asked
me
nothing
but
then
even
then
it
was
too
late
and
that
other
life
which
binds
me
to
him
must
stand
for
ever
between
you
and
me
for
there
is
another
whom
he
has
claimed
and
is
good
to
he
must
not
die--they
cannot
shoot
him
for
that
other's
sake
trent
sat
motionless
but
his
thoughts
ran
on
in
an
interminable
whirl
sylvia
little
sylvia
who
shared
with
him
his
student
life--who
bore
with
him
the
dreary
desolation
of
the
siege
without
complaint--this
slender
blue-eyed
girl
whom
he
was
so
quietly
fond
of
whom
he
teased
or
caressed
as
the
whim
suited
who
sometimes
made
him
the
least
bit
impatient
with
her
passionate
devotion
to
him--could
this
be
the
same
sylvia
who
lay
weeping
there
in
the
darkness
then
he
clinched
his
teeth
let
him
die
let
him
die--but
then--for
sylvia's
sake
and--for
that
other's
sake--yes
he
would
go--he
must
go--his
duty
was
plain
before
him
but
sylvia--he
could
not
be
what
he
had
been
to
her
and
yet
a
vague
terror
seized
him
now
all
was
said
trembling
he
struck
a
light
she
lay
there
her
curly
hair
tumbled
about
her
face
her
small
white
hands
pressed
to
her
breast
he
could
not
leave
her
and
he
could
not
stay
he
never
knew
before
that
he
loved
her
she
had
been
a
mere
comrade
this
girl
wife
of
his
ah
he
loved
her
now
with
all
his
heart
and
soul
and
he
knew
it
only
when
it
was
too
late
too
late
why
then
he
thought
of
that
other
one
binding
her
linking
her
forever
to
the
creature
who
stood
in
danger
of
his
life
with
an
oath
he
sprang
to
the
door
but
the
door
would
not
open--or
was
it
that
he
pressed
it
back--locked
it--and
flung
himself
on
his
knees
beside
the
bed
knowing
that
he
dared
not
for
his
life's
sake
leave
what
was
his
all
in
life
iii
it
was
four
in
the
morning
when
he
came
out
of
the
prison
of
the
condemned
with
the
secretary
of
the
american
legation
a
knot
of
people
had
gathered
around
the
american
minister's
carriage
which
stood
in
front
of
the
prison
the
horses
stamping
and
pawing
in
the
icy
street
the
coachman
huddled
on
the
box
wrapped
in
furs
southwark
helped
the
secretary
into
the
carriage
and
shook
hands
with
trent
thanking
him
for
coming
how
the
scoundrel
did
stare
he
said
your
evidence
was
worse
than
a
kick
but
it
saved
his
skin
for
the
moment
at
least--and
prevented
complications
the
secretary
sighed
we
have
done
our
part
now
let
them
prove
him
a
spy
and
we
wash
our
hands
of
him
jump
in
captain
come
along
trent
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
captain
southwark
i
won't
detain
him
said
trent
hastily
and
dropping
his
voice
southwark
help
me
now
you
know
the
story
from
the
blackguard
you
know
the--the
child
is
at
his
rooms
get
it
and
take
it
to
my
own
apartment
and
if
he
is
shot
i
will
provide
a
home
for
it
i
understand
said
the
captain
gravely
will
you
do
this
at
once
at
once
he
replied
their
hands
met
in
a
warm
clasp
and
then
captain
southwark
climbed
into
the
carriage
motioning
trent
to
follow
but
he
shook
his
head
saying
good-bye
and
the
carriage
rolled
away
he
watched
the
carriage
to
the
end
of
the
street
then
started
toward
his
own
quarter
but
after
a
step
or
two
hesitated
stopped
and
finally
turned
away
in
the
opposite
direction
something--perhaps
it
was
the
sight
of
the
prisoner
he
had
so
recently
confronted
nauseated
him
he
felt
the
need
of
solitude
and
quiet
to
collect
his
thoughts
the
events
of
the
evening
had
shaken
him
terribly
but
he
would
walk
it
off
forget
bury
everything
and
then
go
back
to
sylvia
he
started
on
swiftly
and
for
a
time
the
bitter
thoughts
seemed
to
fade
but
when
he
paused
at
last
breathless
under
the
arc
de
triomphe
the
bitterness
and
the
wretchedness
of
the
whole
thing--yes
of
his
whole
misspent
life
came
back
with
a
pang
then
the
face
of
the
prisoner
stamped
with
the
horrible
grimace
of
fear
grew
in
the
shadows
before
his
eyes
sick
at
heart
he
wandered
up
and
down
under
the
great
arc
striving
to
occupy
his
mind
peering
up
at
the
sculptured
cornices
to
read
the
names
of
the
heroes
and
battles
which
he
knew
were
engraved
there
but
always
the
ashen
face
of
hartman
followed
him
grinning
with
terror--or
was
it
terror--was
it
not
triumph--at
the
thought
he
leaped
like
a
man
who
feels
a
knife
at
his
throat
but
after
a
savage
tramp
around
the
square
came
back
again
and
sat
down
to
battle
with
his
misery
the
air
was
cold
but
his
cheeks
were
burning
with
angry
shame
shame
why
was
it
because
he
had
married
a
girl
whom
chance
had
made
a
mother
did
he
love
her
was
this
miserable
bohemian
existence
then
his
end
and
aim
in
life
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
secrets
of
his
heart
and
read
an
evil
story--the
story
of
the
past
and
he
covered
his
face
for
shame
while
keeping
time
to
the
dull
pain
throbbing
in
his
head
his
heart
beat
out
the
story
for
the
future
shame
and
disgrace
roused
at
last
from
a
lethargy
which
had
begun
to
numb
the
bitterness
of
his
thoughts
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
about
a
sudden
fog
had
settled
in
the
streets
the
arches
of
the
arc
were
choked
with
it
he
would
go
home
a
great
horror
of
being
alone
seized
him
but
he
was
not
alone
the
fog
was
peopled
with
phantoms
all
around
him
in
the
mist
they
moved
drifting
through
the
arches
in
lengthening
lines
and
vanished
while
from
the
fog
others
rose
up
swept
past
and
were
engulfed
he
was
not
alone
for
even
at
his
side
they
crowded
touched
him
swarmed
before
him
beside
him
behind
him
pressed
him
back
seized
and
bore
him
with
them
through
the
mist
down
a
dim
avenue
through
lanes
and
alleys
white
with
fog
they
moved
and
if
they
spoke
their
voices
were
dull
as
the
vapour
which
shrouded
them
at
last
in
front
a
bank
of
masonry
and
earth
cut
by
a
massive
iron
barred
gate
towered
up
in
the
fog
slowly
and
more
slowly
they
glided
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
thigh
to
thigh
then
all
movement
ceased
a
sudden
breeze
stirred
the
fog
it
wavered
and
eddied
objects
became
more
distinct
a
pallor
crept
above
the
horizon
touching
the
edges
of
the
watery
clouds
and
drew
dull
sparks
from
a
thousand
bayonets
bayonets--they
were
everywhere
cleaving
the
fog
or
flowing
beneath
it
in
rivers
of
steel
high
on
the
wall
of
masonry
and
earth
a
great
gun
loomed
and
around
it
figures
moved
in
silhouettes
below
a
broad
torrent
of
bayonets
swept
through
the
iron
barred
gateway
out
into
the
shadowy
plain
it
became
lighter
faces
grew
more
distinct
among
the
marching
masses
and
he
recognized
one
you
philippe
the
figure
turned
its
head
trent
cried
is
there
room
for
me
but
the
other
only
waved
his
arm
in
a
vague
adieu
and
was
gone
with
the
rest
presently
the
cavalry
began
to
pass
squadron
on
squadron
crowding
out
into
the
darkness
then
many
cannon
then
an
ambulance
then
again
the
endless
lines
of
bayonets
beside
him
a
cuirassier
sat
on
his
steaming
horse
and
in
front
among
a
group
of
mounted
officers
he
saw
a
general
with
the
astrakan
collar
of
his
dolman
turned
up
about
his
bloodless
face
some
women
were
weeping
near
him
and
one
was
struggling
to
force
a
loaf
of
black
bread
into
a
soldier's
haversack
the
soldier
tried
to
aid
her
but
the
sack
was
fastened
and
his
rifle
bothered
him
so
trent
held
it
while
the
woman
unbuttoned
the
sack
and
forced
in
the
bread
now
all
wet
with
her
tears
the
rifle
was
not
heavy
trent
found
it
wonderfully
manageable
was
the
bayonet
sharp
he
tried
it
then
a
sudden
longing
a
fierce
imperative
desire
took
possession
of
him
chouette
cried
a
gamin
clinging
to
the
barred
gate
encore
toi
mon
vieux
trent
looked
up
and
the
rat-killer
laughed
in
his
face
but
when
the
soldier
had
taken
the
rifle
again
and
thanking
him
ran
hard
to
catch
his
battalion
he
plunged
into
the
throng
about
the
gateway
are
you
going
he
cried
to
a
marine
who
sat
in
the
gutter
bandaging
his
foot
yes
then
a
girl--a
mere
child--caught
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
into
the
cafã©
which
faced
the
gate
the
room
was
crowded
with
soldiers
some
white
and
silent
sitting
on
the
floor
others
groaning
on
the
leather-covered
settees
the
air
was
sour
and
suffocating
choose
said
the
girl
with
a
little
gesture
of
pity
they
can't
go
in
a
heap
of
clothing
on
the
floor
he
found
a
capote
and
kã©pi
she
helped
him
buckle
his
knapsack
cartridge-box
and
belt
and
showed
him
how
to
load
the
chasse-pot
rifle
holding
it
on
her
knees
when
he
thanked
her
she
started
to
her
feet
you
are
a
foreigner
american
he
said
moving
toward
the
door
but
the
child
barred
his
way
i
am
a
bretonne
my
father
is
up
there
with
the
cannon
of
the
marine
he
will
shoot
you
if
you
are
a
spy
they
faced
each
other
for
a
moment
then
sighing
he
bent
over
and
kissed
the
child
pray
for
france
little
one
he
murmured
and
she
repeated
with
a
pale
smile
for
france
and
you
beau
monsieur
he
ran
across
the
street
and
through
the
gateway
once
outside
he
edged
into
line
and
shouldered
his
way
along
the
road
a
corporal
passed
looked
at
him
repassed
and
finally
called
an
officer
you
belong
to
the
60th
growled
the
corporal
looking
at
the
number
on
his
kã©pi
we
have
no
use
for
franc-tireurs
added
the
officer
catching
sight
of
his
black
trousers
i
wish
to
volunteer
in
place
of
a
comrade
said
trent
and
the
officer
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
passed
on
nobody
paid
much
attention
to
him
one
or
two
merely
glancing
at
his
trousers
the
road
was
deep
with
slush
and
mud-ploughed
and
torn
by
wheels
and
hoofs
a
soldier
in
front
of
him
wrenched
his
foot
in
an
icy
rut
and
dragged
himself
to
the
edge
of
the
embankment
groaning
the
plain
on
either
side
of
them
was
grey
with
melting
snow
here
and
there
behind
dismantled
hedge-rows
stood
wagons
bearing
white
flags
with
red
crosses
sometimes
the
driver
was
a
priest
in
rusty
hat
and
gown
sometimes
a
crippled
mobile
once
they
passed
a
wagon
driven
by
a
sister
of
charity
silent
empty
houses
with
great
rents
in
their
walls
and
every
window
blank
huddled
along
the
road
further
on
within
the
zone
of
danger
nothing
of
human
habitation
remained
except
here
and
there
a
pile
of
frozen
bricks
or
a
blackened
cellar
choked
with
snow
for
some
time
trent
had
been
annoyed
by
the
man
behind
him
who
kept
treading
on
his
heels
convinced
at
last
that
it
was
intentional
he
turned
to
remonstrate
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
fellow-student
from
the
beaux
arts
trent
stared
i
thought
you
were
in
the
hospital
the
other
shook
his
head
pointing
to
his
bandaged
jaw
i
see
you
can't
speak
can
i
do
anything
the
wounded
man
rummaged
in
his
haversack
and
produced
a
crust
of
black
bread
he
can't
eat
it
his
jaw
is
smashed
and
he
wants
you
to
chew
it
for
him
said
the
soldier
next
to
him
trent
took
the
crust
and
grinding
it
in
his
teeth
morsel
by
morsel
passed
it
back
to
the
starving
man
from
time
to
time
mounted
orderlies
sped
to
the
front
covering
them
with
slush
it
was
a
chilly
silent
march
through
sodden
meadows
wreathed
in
fog
along
the
railroad
embankment
across
the
ditch
another
column
moved
parallel
to
their
own
trent
watched
it
a
sombre
mass
now
distinct
now
vague
now
blotted
out
in
a
puff
of
fog
once
for
half-an-hour
he
lost
it
but
when
again
it
came
into
view
he
noticed
a
thin
line
detach
itself
from
the
flank
and
bellying
in
the
middle
swing
rapidly
to
the
west
at
the
same
moment
a
prolonged
crackling
broke
out
in
the
fog
in
front
other
lines
began
to
slough
off
from
the
column
swinging
east
and
west
and
the
crackling
became
continuous
a
battery
passed
at
full
gallop
and
he
drew
back
with
his
comrades
to
give
it
way
it
went
into
action
a
little
to
the
right
of
his
battalion
and
as
the
shot
from
the
first
rifled
piece
boomed
through
the
mist
the
cannon
from
the
fortifications
opened
with
a
mighty
roar
an
officer
galloped
by
shouting
something
which
trent
did
not
catch
but
he
saw
the
ranks
in
front
suddenly
part
company
with
his
own
and
disappear
in
the
twilight
more
officers
rode
up
and
stood
beside
him
peering
into
the
fog
away
in
front
the
crackling
had
become
one
prolonged
crash
it
was
dreary
waiting
trent
chewed
some
bread
for
the
man
behind
who
tried
to
swallow
it
and
after
a
while
shook
his
head
motioning
trent
to
eat
the
rest
himself
a
corporal
offered
him
a
little
brandy
and
he
drank
it
but
when
he
turned
around
to
return
the
flask
the
corporal
was
lying
on
the
ground
alarmed
he
looked
at
the
soldier
next
to
him
who
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
but
something
struck
him
and
he
rolled
over
and
over
into
the
ditch
below
at
that
moment
the
horse
of
one
of
the
officers
gave
a
bound
and
backed
into
the
battalion
lashing
out
with
his
heels
one
man
was
ridden
down
another
was
kicked
in
the
chest
and
hurled
through
the
ranks
the
officer
sank
his
spurs
into
the
horse
and
forced
him
to
the
front
again
where
he
stood
trembling
the
cannonade
seemed
to
draw
nearer
a
staff-officer
riding
slowly
up
and
down
the
battalion
suddenly
collapsed
in
his
saddle
and
clung
to
his
horse's
mane
one
of
his
boots
dangled
crimsoned
and
dripping
from
the
stirrup
then
out
of
the
mist
in
front
men
came
running
the
roads
the
fields
the
ditches
were
full
of
them
and
many
of
them
fell
for
an
instant
he
imagined
he
saw
horsemen
riding
about
like
ghosts
in
the
vapours
beyond
and
a
man
behind
him
cursed
horribly
declaring
he
too
had
seen
them
and
that
they
were
uhlans
but
the
battalion
stood
inactive
and
the
mist
fell
again
over
the
meadows
the
colonel
sat
heavily
upon
his
horse
his
bullet-shaped
head
buried
in
the
astrakan
collar
of
his
dolman
his
fat
legs
sticking
straight
out
in
the
stirrups
the
buglers
clustered
about
him
with
bugles
poised
and
behind
him
a
staff-officer
in
a
pale
blue
jacket
smoked
a
cigarette
and
chatted
with
a
captain
of
hussars
from
the
road
in
front
came
the
sound
of
furious
galloping
and
an
orderly
reined
up
beside
the
colonel
who
motioned
him
to
the
rear
without
turning
his
head
then
on
the
left
a
confused
murmur
arose
which
ended
in
a
shout
a
hussar
passed
like
the
wind
followed
by
another
and
another
and
then
squadron
after
squadron
whirled
by
them
into
the
sheeted
mists
at
that
instant
the
colonel
reared
in
his
saddle
the
bugles
clanged
and
the
whole
battalion
scrambled
down
the
embankment
over
the
ditch
and
started
across
the
soggy
meadow
almost
at
once
trent
lost
his
cap
something
snatched
it
from
his
head
he
thought
it
was
a
tree
branch
a
good
many
of
his
comrades
rolled
over
in
the
slush
and
ice
and
he
imagined
that
they
had
slipped
one
pitched
right
across
his
path
and
he
stopped
to
help
him
up
but
the
man
screamed
when
he
touched
him
and
an
officer
shouted
forward
forward
so
he
ran
on
again
it
was
a
long
jog
through
the
mist
and
he
was
often
obliged
to
shift
his
rifle
when
at
last
they
lay
panting
behind
the
railroad
embankment
he
looked
about
him
he
had
felt
the
need
of
action
of
a
desperate
physical
struggle
of
killing
and
crushing
he
had
been
seized
with
a
desire
to
fling
himself
among
masses
and
tear
right
and
left
he
longed
to
fire
to
use
the
thin
sharp
bayonet
on
his
chassepot
he
had
not
expected
this
he
wished
to
become
exhausted
to
struggle
and
cut
until
incapable
of
lifting
his
arm
then
he
had
intended
to
go
home
he
heard
a
man
say
that
half
the
battalion
had
gone
down
in
the
charge
and
he
saw
another
examining
a
corpse
under
the
embankment
the
body
still
warm
was
clothed
in
a
strange
uniform
but
even
when
he
noticed
the
spiked
helmet
lying
a
few
inches
further
away
he
did
not
realize
what
had
happened
the
colonel
sat
on
his
horse
a
few
feet
to
the
left
his
eyes
sparkling
under
the
crimson
kã©pi
trent
heard
him
reply
to
an
officer
i
can
hold
it
but
another
charge
and
i
won't
have
enough
men
left
to
sound
a
bugle
were
the
prussians
here
trent
asked
of
a
soldier
who
sat
wiping
the
blood
trickling
from
his
hair
yes
the
hussars
cleaned
them
out
we
caught
their
cross
fire
we
are
supporting
a
battery
on
the
embankment
said
another
then
the
battalion
crawled
over
the
embankment
and
moved
along
the
lines
of
twisted
rails
trent
rolled
up
his
trousers
and
tucked
them
into
his
woollen
socks
but
they
halted
again
and
some
of
the
men
sat
down
on
the
dismantled
railroad
track
trent
looked
for
his
wounded
comrade
from
the
beaux
arts
he
was
standing
in
his
place
very
pale
the
cannonade
had
become
terrific
for
a
moment
the
mist
lifted
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
first
battalion
motionless
on
the
railroad
track
in
front
of
regiments
on
either
flank
and
then
as
the
fog
settled
again
the
drums
beat
and
the
music
of
the
bugles
began
away
on
the
extreme
left
a
restless
movement
passed
among
the
troops
the
colonel
threw
up
his
arm
the
drums
rolled
and
the
battalion
moved
off
through
the
fog
they
were
near
the
front
now
for
the
battalion
was
firing
as
it
advanced
ambulances
galloped
along
the
base
of
the
embankment
to
the
rear
and
the
hussars
passed
and
repassed
like
phantoms
they
were
in
the
front
at
last
for
all
about
them
was
movement
and
turmoil
while
from
the
fog
close
at
hand
came
cries
and
groans
and
crashing
volleys
shells
fell
everywhere
bursting
along
the
embankment
splashing
them
with
frozen
slush
trent
was
frightened
he
began
to
dread
the
unknown
which
lay
there
crackling
and
flaming
in
obscurity
the
shock
of
the
cannon
sickened
him
he
could
even
see
the
fog
light
up
with
a
dull
orange
as
the
thunder
shook
the
earth
it
was
near
he
felt
certain
for
the
colonel
shouted
forward
and
the
first
battalion
was
hastening
into
it
he
felt
its
breath
he
trembled
but
hurried
on
a
fearful
discharge
in
front
terrified
him
somewhere
in
the
fog
men
were
cheering
and
the
colonel's
horse
streaming
with
blood
plunged
about
in
the
smoke
another
blast
and
shock
right
in
his
face
almost
stunned
him
and
he
faltered
all
the
men
to
the
right
were
down
his
head
swam
the
fog
and
smoke
stupefied
him
he
put
out
his
hand
for
a
support
and
caught
something
it
was
the
wheel
of
a
gun-carriage
and
a
man
sprang
from
behind
it
aiming
a
blow
at
his
head
with
a
rammer
but
stumbled
back
shrieking
with
a
bayonet
through
his
neck
and
trent
knew
that
he
had
killed
mechanically
he
stooped
to
pick
up
his
rifle
but
the
bayonet
was
still
in
the
man
who
lay
beating
with
red
hands
against
the
sod
it
sickened
him
and
he
leaned
on
the
cannon
men
were
fighting
all
around
him
now
and
the
air
was
foul
with
smoke
and
sweat
somebody
seized
him
from
behind
and
another
in
front
but
others
in
turn
seized
them
or
struck
them
solid
blows
the
click
click
click
of
bayonets
infuriated
him
and
he
grasped
the
rammer
and
struck
out
blindly
until
it
was
shivered
to
pieces
a
man
threw
his
arm
around
his
neck
and
bore
him
to
the
ground
but
he
throttled
him
and
raised
himself
on
his
knees
he
saw
a
comrade
seize
the
cannon
and
fall
across
it
with
his
skull
crushed
in
he
saw
the
colonel
tumble
clean
out
of
his
saddle
into
the
mud
then
consciousness
fled
when
he
came
to
himself
he
was
lying
on
the
embankment
among
the
twisted
rails
on
every
side
huddled
men
who
cried
out
and
cursed
and
fled
away
into
the
fog
and
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
followed
them
once
he
stopped
to
help
a
comrade
with
a
bandaged
jaw
who
could
not
speak
but
clung
to
his
arm
for
a
time
and
then
fell
dead
in
the
freezing
mire
and
again
he
aided
another
who
groaned
trent
c'est
moi--philippe
until
a
sudden
volley
in
the
midst
relieved
him
of
his
charge
an
icy
wind
swept
down
from
the
heights
cutting
the
fog
into
shreds
for
an
instant
with
an
evil
leer
the
sun
peered
through
the
naked
woods
of
vincennes
sank
like
a
blood-clot
in
the
battery
smoke
lower
lower
into
the
blood-soaked
plain
iv
when
midnight
sounded
from
the
belfry
of
st
sulpice
the
gates
of
paris
were
still
choked
with
fragments
of
what
had
once
been
an
army
they
entered
with
the
night
a
sullen
horde
spattered
with
slime
faint
with
hunger
and
exhaustion
there
was
little
disorder
at
first
and
the
throng
at
the
gates
parted
silently
as
the
troops
tramped
along
the
freezing
streets
confusion
came
as
the
hours
passed
swiftly
and
more
swiftly
crowding
squadron
after
squadron
and
battery
on
battery
horses
plunging
and
caissons
jolting
the
remnants
from
the
front
surged
through
the
gates
a
chaos
of
cavalry
and
artillery
struggling
for
the
right
of
way
close
upon
them
stumbled
the
infantry
here
a
skeleton
of
a
regiment
marching
with
a
desperate
attempt
at
order
there
a
riotous
mob
of
mobiles
crushing
their
way
to
the
streets
then
a
turmoil
of
horsemen
cannon
troops
without
officers
officers
without
men
then
again
a
line
of
ambulances
the
wheels
groaning
under
their
heavy
loads
dumb
with
misery
the
crowd
looked
on
all
through
the
day
the
ambulances
had
been
arriving
and
all
day
long
the
ragged
throng
whimpered
and
shivered
by
the
barriers
at
noon
the
crowd
was
increased
ten-fold
filling
the
squares
about
the
gates
and
swarming
over
the
inner
fortifications
at
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
the
german
batteries
suddenly
wreathed
themselves
in
smoke
and
the
shells
fell
fast
on
montparnasse
at
twenty
minutes
after
four
two
projectiles
struck
a
house
in
the
rue
de
bac
and
a
moment
later
the
first
shell
fell
in
the
latin
quarter
braith
was
painting
in
bed
when
west
came
in
very
much
scared
i
wish
you
would
come
down
our
house
has
been
knocked
into
a
cocked
hat
and
i'm
afraid
that
some
of
the
pillagers
may
take
it
into
their
heads
to
pay
us
a
visit
to-night
braith
jumped
out
of
bed
and
bundled
himself
into
a
garment
which
had
once
been
an
overcoat
anybody
hurt
he
inquired
struggling
with
a
sleeve
full
of
dilapidated
lining
no
colette
is
barricaded
in
the
cellar
and
the
concierge
ran
away
to
the
fortifications
there
will
be
a
rough
gang
there
if
the
bombardment
keeps
up
you
might
help
us--
of
course
said
braith
but
it
was
not
until
they
had
reached
the
rue
serpente
and
had
turned
in
the
passage
which
led
to
west's
cellar
that
the
latter
cried
have
you
seen
jack
trent
to-day
no
replied
braith
looking
troubled
he
was
not
at
ambulance
headquarters
he
stayed
to
take
care
of
sylvia
i
suppose
a
bomb
came
crashing
through
the
roof
of
a
house
at
the
end
of
the
alley
and
burst
in
the
basement
showering
the
street
with
slate
and
plaster
a
second
struck
a
chimney
and
plunged
into
the
garden
followed
by
an
avalanche
of
bricks
and
another
exploded
with
a
deafening
report
in
the
next
street
they
hurried
along
the
passage
to
the
steps
which
led
to
the
cellar
here
again
braith
stopped
don't
you
think
i
had
better
run
up
to
see
if
jack
and
sylvia
are
well
entrenched
i
can
get
back
before
dark
no
go
in
and
find
colette
and
i'll
go
no
no
let
me
go
there's
no
danger
i
know
it
replied
west
calmly
and
dragging
braith
into
the
alley
pointed
to
the
cellar
steps
the
iron
door
was
barred
colette
colette
he
called
the
door
swung
inward
and
the
girl
sprang
up
the
stairs
to
meet
them
at
that
instant
braith
glancing
behind
him
gave
a
startled
cry
and
pushing
the
two
before
him
into
the
cellar
jumped
down
after
them
and
slammed
the
iron
door
a
few
seconds
later
a
heavy
jar
from
the
outside
shook
the
hinges
they
are
here
muttered
west
very
pale
that
door
observed
colette
calmly
will
hold
for
ever
braith
examined
the
low
iron
structure
now
trembling
with
the
blows
rained
on
it
from
without
west
glanced
anxiously
at
colette
who
displayed
no
agitation
and
this
comforted
him
i
don't
believe
they
will
spend
much
time
here
said
braith
they
only
rummage
in
cellars
for
spirits
i
imagine
unless
they
hear
that
valuables
are
buried
there
but
surely
nothing
is
buried
here
exclaimed
braith
uneasily
unfortunately
there
is
growled
west
that
miserly
landlord
of
mine--
a
crash
from
the
outside
followed
by
a
yell
cut
him
short
then
blow
after
blow
shook
the
doors
until
there
came
a
sharp
snap
a
clinking
of
metal
and
a
triangular
bit
of
iron
fell
inwards
leaving
a
hole
through
which
struggled
a
ray
of
light
instantly
west
knelt
and
shoving
his
revolver
through
the
aperture
fired
every
cartridge
for
a
moment
the
alley
resounded
with
the
racket
of
the
revolver
then
absolute
silence
followed
presently
a
single
questioning
blow
fell
upon
the
door
and
a
moment
later
another
and
another
and
then
a
sudden
crack
zigzagged
across
the
iron
plate
here
said
west
seizing
colette
by
the
wrist
you
follow
me
braith
and
he
ran
swiftly
toward
a
circular
spot
of
light
at
the
further
end
of
the
cellar
the
spot
of
light
came
from
a
barred
man-hole
above
west
motioned
braith
to
mount
on
his
shoulders
push
it
over
you
must
with
little
effort
braith
lifted
the
barred
cover
scrambled
out
on
his
stomach
and
easily
raised
colette
from
west's
shoulders
quick
old
chap
cried
the
latter
braith
twisted
his
legs
around
a
fence-chain
and
leaned
down
again
the
cellar
was
flooded
with
a
yellow
light
and
the
air
reeked
with
the
stench
of
petroleum
torches
the
iron
door
still
held
but
a
whole
plate
of
metal
was
gone
and
now
as
they
looked
a
figure
came
creeping
through
holding
a
torch
quick
whispered
braith
jump
and
west
hung
dangling
until
colette
grasped
him
by
the
collar
and
he
was
dragged
out
then
her
nerves
gave
way
and
she
wept
hysterically
but
west
threw
his
arm
around
her
and
led
her
across
the
gardens
into
the
next
street
where
braith
after
replacing
the
man-hole
cover
and
piling
some
stone
slabs
from
the
wall
over
it
rejoined
them
it
was
almost
dark
they
hurried
through
the
street
now
only
lighted
by
burning
buildings
or
the
swift
glare
of
the
shells
they
gave
wide
berth
to
the
fires
but
at
a
distance
saw
the
flitting
forms
of
pillagers
among
the
dã©bris
sometimes
they
passed
a
female
fury
crazed
with
drink
shrieking
anathemas
upon
the
world
or
some
slouching
lout
whose
blackened
face
and
hands
betrayed
his
share
in
the
work
of
destruction
at
last
they
reached
the
seine
and
passed
the
bridge
and
then
braith
said
i
must
go
back
i
am
not
sure
of
jack
and
sylvia
as
he
spoke
he
made
way
for
a
crowd
which
came
trampling
across
the
bridge
and
along
the
river
wall
by
the
d'orsay
barracks
in
the
midst
of
it
west
caught
the
measured
tread
of
a
platoon
a
lantern
passed
a
file
of
bayonets
then
another
lantern
which
glimmered
on
a
deathly
face
behind
and
colette
gasped
hartman
and
he
was
gone
they
peered
fearfully
across
the
embankment
holding
their
breath
there
was
a
shuffle
of
feet
on
the
quay
and
the
gate
of
the
barracks
slammed
a
lantern
shone
for
a
moment
at
the
postern
the
crowd
pressed
to
the
grille
then
came
the
clang
of
the
volley
from
the
stone
parade
one
by
one
the
petroleum
torches
flared
up
along
the
embankment
and
now
the
whole
square
was
in
motion
down
from
the
champs
elysã©es
and
across
the
place
de
la
concorde
straggled
the
fragments
of
the
battle
a
company
here
and
a
mob
there
they
poured
in
from
every
street
followed
by
women
and
children
and
a
great
murmur
borne
on
the
icy
wind
swept
through
the
arc
de
triomphe
and
down
the
dark
avenue--perdus
perdus
a
ragged
end
of
a
battalion
was
pressing
past
the
spectre
of
annihilation
west
groaned
then
a
figure
sprang
from
the
shadowy
ranks
and
called
west's
name
and
when
he
saw
it
was
trent
he
cried
out
trent
seized
him
white
with
terror
sylvia
west
stared
speechless
but
colette
moaned
oh
sylvia
sylvia--and
they
are
shelling
the
quarter
trent
shouted
braith
but
he
was
gone
and
they
could
not
overtake
them
the
bombardment
ceased
as
trent
crossed
the
boulevard
st
germain
but
the
entrance
to
the
rue
de
seine
was
blocked
by
a
heap
of
smoking
bricks
everywhere
the
shells
had
torn
great
holes
in
the
pavement
the
cafã©
was
a
wreck
of
splinters
and
glass
the
book-store
tottered
ripped
from
roof
to
basement
and
the
little
bakery
long
since
closed
bulged
outward
above
a
mass
of
slate
and
tin
he
climbed
over
the
steaming
bricks
and
hurried
into
the
rue
de
tournon
on
the
corner
a
fire
blazed
lighting
up
his
own
street
and
on
the
bank
wall
beneath
a
shattered
gas
lamp
a
child
was
writing
with
a
bit
of
cinder
here
fell
the
first
shell
the
letters
stared
him
in
the
face
the
rat-killer
finished
and
stepped
back
to
view
his
work
but
catching
sight
of
trent's
bayonet
screamed
and
fled
and
as
trent
staggered
across
the
shattered
street
from
holes
and
crannies
in
the
ruins
fierce
women
fled
from
their
work
of
pillage
cursing
him
at
first
he
could
not
find
his
house
for
the
tears
blinded
him
but
he
felt
along
the
wall
and
reached
the
door
a
lantern
burned
in
the
concierge's
lodge
and
the
old
man
lay
dead
beside
it
faint
with
fright
he
leaned
a
moment
on
his
rifle
then
snatching
the
lantern
sprang
up
the
stairs
he
tried
to
call
but
his
tongue
hardly
moved
on
the
second
floor
he
saw
plaster
on
the
stairway
and
on
the
third
the
floor
was
torn
and
the
concierge
lay
in
a
pool
of
blood
across
the
landing
the
next
floor
was
his
theirs
the
door
hung
from
its
hinges
the
walls
gaped
he
crept
in
and
sank
down
by
the
bed
and
there
two
arms
were
flung
around
his
neck
and
a
tear-stained
face
sought
his
own
sylvia
o
jack
jack
jack
from
the
tumbled
pillow
beside
them
a
child
wailed
they
brought
it
it
is
mine
she
sobbed
ours
he
whispered
with
his
arms
around
them
both
then
from
the
stairs
below
came
braith's
anxious
voice
trent
is
all
well
the
street
of
our
lady
of
the
fields
et
tout
les
jours
passã©s
dans
la
tristesse
nous
sont
comptã©s
comme
des
jours
heureux
i
the
street
is
not
fashionable
neither
is
it
shabby
it
is
a
pariah
among
streets--a
street
without
a
quarter
it
is
generally
understood
to
lie
outside
the
pale
of
the
aristocratic
avenue
de
l'observatoire
the
students
of
the
montparnasse
quarter
consider
it
swell
and
will
have
none
of
it
the
latin
quarter
from
the
luxembourg
its
northern
frontier
sneers
at
its
respectability
and
regards
with
disfavour
the
correctly
costumed
students
who
haunt
it
few
strangers
go
into
it
at
times
however
the
latin
quarter
students
use
it
as
a
thoroughfare
between
the
rue
de
rennes
and
the
bullier
but
except
for
that
and
the
weekly
afternoon
visits
of
parents
and
guardians
to
the
convent
near
the
rue
vavin
the
street
of
our
lady
of
the
fields
is
as
quiet
as
a
passy
boulevard
perhaps
the
most
respectable
portion
lies
between
the
rue
de
la
grande
chaumiã¨re
and
the
rue
vavin
at
least
this
was
the
conclusion
arrived
at
by
the
reverend
joel
byram
as
he
rambled
through
it
with
hastings
in
charge
to
hastings
the
street
looked
pleasant
in
the
bright
june
weather
and
he
had
begun
to
hope
for
its
selection
when
the
reverend
byram
shied
violently
at
the
cross
on
the
convent
opposite
jesuits
he
muttered
well
said
hastings
wearily
i
imagine
we
won't
find
anything
better
you
say
yourself
that
vice
is
triumphant
in
paris
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
every
street
we
find
jesuits
or
something
worse
after
a
moment
he
repeated
or
something
worse
which
of
course
i
would
not
notice
except
for
your
kindness
in
warning
me
dr
byram
sucked
in
his
lips
and
looked
about
him
he
was
impressed
by
the
evident
respectability
of
the
surroundings
then
frowning
at
the
convent
he
took
hastings'
arm
and
shuffled
across
the
street
to
an
iron
gateway
which
bore
the
number
201
bis
painted
in
white
on
a
blue
ground
below
this
was
a
notice
printed
in
english
1

2
for

please
oppress

3
for

thrice
hastings
touched
the
electric
button
three
times
and
they
were
ushered
through
the
garden
and
into
the
parlour
by
a
trim
maid
the
dining-room
door
just
beyond
was
open
and
from
the
table
in
plain
view
a
stout
woman
hastily
arose
and
came
toward
them
hastings
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
young
man
with
a
big
head
and
several
snuffy
old
gentlemen
at
breakfast
before
the
door
closed
and
the
stout
woman
waddled
into
the
room
bringing
with
her
an
aroma
of
coffee
and
a
black
poodle
it
ees
a

here
the

growled
at
dr
byram
and
was
promptly
cuffed
by
his
mistress
veux

she
cried
with
a
slap

said
hastings
smiling

fled
and
his
mistress
cried
ah

like
a

young

then
dr
byram
managed
to
get
in

word
or

and
gathered

or
less
information
with
regard
to

then
they
went
upstairs
to
examine
hastings'
future
quarters
test
the
bed-springs
and
arrange
for
the
weekly
towel
allowance
dr
byram
appeared
satisfied
madame
marotte
accompanied
them
to
the
door
and
rang
for
the
maid
but
as
hastings
stepped
out
into
the
gravel
walk
his
guide
and
mentor
paused
a
moment
and
fixed
madame
with
his
watery
eyes
you
understand
he
said
that
he
is
a
youth
of
most
careful
bringing
up
and
his
character
and
morals
are
without
a
stain
he
is
young
and
has
never
been
abroad
never
even
seen
a
large
city
and
his
parents
have
requested
me
as
an
old
family
friend
living
in
paris
to
see
that
he
is
placed
under
good
influences
he
is
to
study
art
but
on
no
account
would
his
parents
wish
him
to
live
in
the
latin
quarter
if
they
knew
of
the
immorality
which
is
rife
there
a
sound
like
the
click
of
a
latch
interrupted
him
and
he
raised
his
eyes
but
not
in
time
to
see
the
maid
slap
the
big-headed
young
man
behind
the
parlour-door
madame
coughed
cast
a
deadly
glance
behind
her
and
then
beamed
on
dr
byram
it
ees
well
zat
he
come
here
the
pension
more
serious
il
n'en
existe

ees
not
any
she
announced
with
conviction
so
as
there
was
nothing
more
to
add
dr
byram
joined
hastings
at
the
gate
i
trust
he
said
eyeing
the
convent
that
you
will
make
no
acquaintances
among
jesuits
hastings
looked
at
the
convent
until
a
pretty
girl
passed
before
the
gray
faã§ade
and
then
he
looked
at
her
a
young
fellow
with
a
paint-box
and
canvas
came
swinging
along
stopped
before
the
pretty
girl
said
something
during
a
brief
but
vigorous
handshake
at
which
they
both
laughed
and
he
went
his
way
calling
back
ã
demain
valentine
as
in
the
same
breath
she
cried
ã
demain
valentine
thought
hastings
what
a
quaint
name
and
he
started
to
follow
the
reverend
joel
byram
who
was
shuffling
towards
the
nearest
tramway
station
ii
an'
you
are
pleas
wiz
paris
monsieur'
astang
demanded
madame
marotte
the
next
morning
as
hastings
came
into
the
breakfast-room
of
the
pension
rosy
from
his
plunge
in
the
limited
bath
above
i
am
sure
i
shall
like
it
he
replied
wondering
at
his
own
depression
of
spirits
the
maid
brought
him
coffee
and
rolls
he
returned
the
vacant
glance
of
the
big-headed
young
man
and
acknowledged
diffidently
the
salutes
of
the
snuffy
old
gentlemen
he
did
not
try
to
finish
his
coffee
and
sat
crumbling
a
roll
unconscious
of
the
sympathetic
glances
of
madame
marotte
who
had
tact
enough
not
to
bother
him
presently
a
maid
entered
with
a
tray
on
which
were
balanced
two
bowls
of
chocolate
and
the
snuffy
old
gentlemen
leered
at
her
ankles
the
maid
deposited
the
chocolate
at
a
table
near
the
window
and
smiled
at
hastings
then
a
thin
young
lady
followed
by
her
counterpart
in
all
except
years
marched
into
the
room
and
took
the
table
near
the
window
they
were
evidently
american
but
hastings
if
he
expected
any
sign
of
recognition
was
disappointed
to
be
ignored
by
compatriots
intensified
his
depression
he
fumbled
with
his
knife
and
looked
at
his
plate
the
thin
young
lady
was
talkative
enough
she
was
quite
aware
of
hastings'
presence
ready
to
be
flattered
if
he
looked
at
her
but
on
the
other
hand
she
felt
her
superiority
for
she
had
been
three
weeks
in
paris
and
he
it
was
easy
to
see
had
not
yet
unpacked
his
steamer-trunk
her
conversation
was
complacent
she
argued
with
her
mother
upon
the
relative
merits
of
the
louvre
and
the
bon
marchã©
but
her
mother's
part
of
the
discussion
was
mostly
confined
to
the
observation
why
susie
the
snuffy
old
gentlemen
had
left
the
room
in
a
body
outwardly
polite
and
inwardly
raging
they
could
not
endure
the
americans
who
filled
the
room
with
their
chatter
the
big-headed
young
man
looked
after
them
with
a
knowing
cough
murmuring
gay
old
birds
they
look
like
bad
old
men
mr
bladen
said
the
girl
to
this
mr
bladen
smiled
and
said
they've
had
their
day
in
a
tone
which
implied
that
he
was
now
having
his
and
that's
why
they
all
have
baggy
eyes
cried
the
girl
i
think
it's
a
shame
for
young
gentlemen--
why
susie
said
the
mother
and
the
conversation
lagged
after
a
while
mr
bladen
threw
down
the
petit
journal
which
he
daily
studied
at
the
expense
of
the
house
and
turning
to
hastings
started
to
make
himself
agreeable
he
began
by
saying
i
see
you
are
american
to
this
brilliant
and
original
opening
hastings
deadly
homesick
replied
gratefully
and
the
conversation
was
judiciously
nourished
by
observations
from
miss
susie
byng
distinctly
addressed
to
mr
bladen
in
the
course
of
events
miss
susie
forgetting
to
address
herself
exclusively
to
mr
bladen
and
hastings
replying
to
her
general
question
the
entente
cordiale
was
established
and
susie
and
her
mother
extended
a
protectorate
over
what
was
clearly
neutral
territory
mr
hastings
you
must
not
desert
the
pension
every
evening
as
mr
bladen
does
paris
is
an
awful
place
for
young
gentlemen
and
mr
bladen
is
a
horrid
cynic
mr
bladen
looked
gratified
hastings
answered
i
shall
be
at
the
studio
all
day
and
i
imagine
i
shall
be
glad
enough
to
come
back
at
night
mr
bladen
who
at
a
salary
of
fifteen
dollars
a
week
acted
as
agent
for
the
pewly
manufacturing
company
of
troy
ny
smiled
a
sceptical
smile
and
withdrew
to
keep
an
appointment
with
a
customer
on
the
boulevard
magenta
hastings
walked
into
the
garden
with
mrs
byng
and
susie
and
at
their
invitation
sat
down
in
the
shade
before
the
iron
gate
the
chestnut
trees
still
bore
their
fragrant
spikes
of
pink
and
white
and
the
bees
hummed
among
the
roses
trellised
on
the
white-walled
house
a
faint
freshness
was
in
the
air
the
watering
carts
moved
up
and
down
the
street
and
a
clear
stream
bubbled
over
the
spotless
gutters
of
the
rue
de
la
grande
chaumiã¨re
the
sparrows
were
merry
along
the
curb-stones
taking
bath
after
bath
in
the
water
and
ruffling
their
feathers
with
delight
in
a
walled
garden
across
the
street
a
pair
of
blackbirds
whistled
among
the
almond
trees
hastings
swallowed
the
lump
in
his
throat
for
the
song
of
the
birds
and
the
ripple
of
water
in
a
paris
gutter
brought
back
to
him
the
sunny
meadows
of
millbrook
that's
a
blackbird
observed
miss
byng
see
him
there
on
the
bush
with
pink
blossoms
he's
all
black
except
his
bill
and
that
looks
as
if
it
had
been
dipped
in
an
omelet
as
some
frenchman
says--
why
susie
said
mrs
byng
that
garden
belongs
to
a
studio
inhabited
by
two
americans
continued
the
girl
serenely
and
i
often
see
them
pass
they
seem
to
need
a
great
many
models
mostly
young
and
feminine--
why
susie
perhaps
they
prefer
painting
that
kind
but
i
don't
see
why
they
should
invite
five
with
three
more
young
gentlemen
and
all
get
into
two
cabs
and
drive
away
singing
this
street
she
continued
is
dull
there
is
nothing
to
see
except
the
garden
and
a
glimpse
of
the
boulevard
montparnasse
through
the
rue
de
la
grande
chaumiã¨re
no
one
ever
passes
except
a
policeman
there
is
a
convent
on
the
corner
i
thought
it
was
a
jesuit
college
began
hastings
but
was
at
once
overwhelmed
with
a
baedecker
description
of
the
place
ending
with
on
one
side
stand
the
palatial
hotels
of
jean
paul
laurens
and
guillaume
bouguereau
and
opposite
in
the
little
passage
stanislas
carolus
duran
paints
the
masterpieces
which
charm
the
world
the
blackbird
burst
into
a
ripple
of
golden
throaty
notes
and
from
some
distant
green
spot
in
the
city
an
unknown
wild-bird
answered
with
a
frenzy
of
liquid
trills
until
the
sparrows
paused
in
their
ablutions
to
look
up
with
restless
chirps
then
a
butterfly
came
and
sat
on
a
cluster
of
heliotrope
and
waved
his
crimson-banded
wings
in
the
hot
sunshine
hastings
knew
him
for
a
friend
and
before
his
eyes
there
came
a
vision
of
tall
mulleins
and
scented
milkweed
alive
with
painted
wings
a
vision
of
a
white
house
and
woodbine-covered
piazza--a
glimpse
of
a
man
reading
and
a
woman
leaning
over
the
pansy
bed--and
his
heart
was
full
he
was
startled
a
moment
later
by
miss
byng
i
believe
you
are
homesick
hastings
blushed
miss
byng
looked
at
him
with
a
sympathetic
sigh
and
continued
whenever
i
felt
homesick
at
first
i
used
to
go
with
mamma
and
walk
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
i
don't
know
why
it
is
but
those
old-fashioned
gardens
seemed
to
bring
me
nearer
home
than
anything
in
this
artificial
city
but
they
are
full
of
marble
statues
said
mrs
byng
mildly
i
don't
see
the
resemblance
myself
where
is
the
luxembourg
inquired
hastings
after
a
silence
come
with
me
to
the
gate
said
miss
byng
he
rose
and
followed
her
and
she
pointed
out
the
rue
vavin
at
the
foot
of
the
street
you
pass
by
the
convent
to
the
right
she
smiled
and
hastings
went
iii
the
luxembourg
was
a
blaze
of
flowers
he
walked
slowly
through
the
long
avenues
of
trees
past
mossy
marbles
and
old-time
columns
and
threading
the
grove
by
the
bronze
lion
came
upon
the
tree-crowned
terrace
above
the
fountain
below
lay
the
basin
shining
in
the
sunlight
flowering
almonds
encircled
the
terrace
and
in
a
greater
spiral
groves
of
chestnuts
wound
in
and
out
and
down
among
the
moist
thickets
by
the
western
palace
wing
at
one
end
of
the
avenue
of
trees
the
observatory
rose
its
white
domes
piled
up
like
an
eastern
mosque
at
the
other
end
stood
the
heavy
palace
with
every
window-pane
ablaze
in
the
fierce
sun
of
june
around
the
fountain
children
and
white-capped
nurses
armed
with
bamboo
poles
were
pushing
toy
boats
whose
sails
hung
limp
in
the
sunshine
a
dark
policeman
wearing
red
epaulettes
and
a
dress
sword
watched
them
for
a
while
and
then
went
away
to
remonstrate
with
a
young
man
who
had
unchained
his
dog
the
dog
was
pleasantly
occupied
in
rubbing
grass
and
dirt
into
his
back
while
his
legs
waved
into
the
air
the
policeman
pointed
at
the
dog
he
was
speechless
with
indignation
well
captain
smiled
the
young
fellow
well
monsieur
student
growled
the
policeman
what
do
you
come
and
complain
to
me
for
if
you
don't
chain
him
i'll
take
him
shouted
the
policeman
what's
that
to
me
mon
capitaine
wha--t
isn't
that
bull-dog
yours
if
it
was
don't
you
suppose
i'd
chain
him
the
officer
glared
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
deciding
that
as
he
was
a
student
he
was
wicked
grabbed
at
the
dog
who
promptly
dodged
around
and
around
the
flower-beds
they
raced
and
when
the
officer
came
too
near
for
comfort
the
bull-dog
cut
across
a
flower-bed
which
perhaps
was
not
playing
fair
the
young
man
was
amused
and
the
dog
also
seemed
to
enjoy
the
exercise
the
policeman
noticed
this
and
decided
to
strike
at
the
fountain-head
of
the
evil
he
stormed
up
to
the
student
and
said
as
the
owner
of
this
public
nuisance
i
arrest
you
but
objected
the
other
i
disclaim
the
dog
that
was
a
poser
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
catch
the
dog
until
three
gardeners
lent
a
hand
but
then
the
dog
simply
ran
away
and
disappeared
in
the
rue
de
medici
the
policeman
shambled
off
to
find
consolation
among
the
white-capped
nurses
and
the
student
looking
at
his
watch
stood
up
yawning
then
catching
sight
of
hastings
he
smiled
and
bowed
hastings
walked
over
to
the
marble
laughing
why
clifford
he
said
i
didn't
recognize
you
it's
my
moustache
sighed
the
other
i
sacrificed
it
to
humour
a
whim
of--of--a
friend
what
do
you
think
of
my
dog
then
he
is
yours
cried
hastings
of
course
it's
a
pleasant
change
for
him
this
playing
tag
with
policemen
but
he
is
known
now
and
i'll
have
to
stop
it
he's
gone
home
he
always
does
when
the
gardeners
take
a
hand
it's
a
pity
he's
fond
of
rolling
on
lawns
then
they
chatted
for
a
moment
of
hastings'
prospects
and
clifford
politely
offered
to
stand
his
sponsor
at
the
studio
you
see
old
tabby
i
mean
dr
byram
told
me
about
you
before
i
met
you
explained
clifford
and
elliott
and
i
will
be
glad
to
do
anything
we
can
then
looking
at
his
watch
again
he
muttered
i
have
just
ten
minutes
to
catch
the
versailles
train
au
revoir
and
started
to
go
but
catching
sight
of
a
girl
advancing
by
the
fountain
took
off
his
hat
with
a
confused
smile
why
are
you
not
at
versailles
she
said
with
an
almost
imperceptible
acknowledgment
of
hastings'
presence
i--i'm
going
murmured
clifford
for
a
moment
they
faced
each
other
and
then
clifford
very
red
stammered
with
your
permission
i
have
the
honour
of
presenting
to
you
my
friend
monsieur
hastings
hastings
bowed
low
she
smiled
very
sweetly
but
there
was
something
of
malice
in
the
quiet
inclination
of
her
small
parisienne
head
i
could
have
wished
she
said
that
monsieur
clifford
might
spare
me
more
time
when
he
brings
with
him
so
charming
an
american
must--must
i
go
valentine
began
clifford
certainly
she
replied
clifford
took
his
leave
with
very
bad
grace
wincing
when
she
added
and
give
my
dearest
love
to
cã©cile
as
he
disappeared
in
the
rue
d'assas
the
girl
turned
as
if
to
go
but
then
suddenly
remembering
hastings
looked
at
him
and
shook
her
head
monsieur
clifford
is
so
perfectly
harebrained
she
smiled
it
is
embarrassing
sometimes
you
have
heard
of
course
all
about
his
success
at
the
salon
he
looked
puzzled
and
she
noticed
it
you
have
been
to
the
salon
of
course
why
no
he
answered
i
only
arrived
in
paris
three
days
ago
she
seemed
to
pay
little
heed
to
his
explanation
but
continued
nobody
imagined
he
had
the
energy
to
do
anything
good
but
on
varnishing
day
the
salon
was
astonished
by
the
entrance
of
monsieur
clifford
who
strolled
about
as
bland
as
you
please
with
an
orchid
in
his
buttonhole
and
a
beautiful
picture
on
the
line
she
smiled
to
herself
at
the
reminiscence
and
looked
at
the
fountain
monsieur
bouguereau
told
me
that
monsieur
julian
was
so
astonished
that
he
only
shook
hands
with
monsieur
clifford
in
a
dazed
manner
and
actually
forgot
to
pat
him
on
the
back
fancy
she
continued
with
much
merriment
fancy
papa
julian
forgetting
to
pat
one
on
the
back
hastings
wondering
at
her
acquaintance
with
the
great
bouguereau
looked
at
her
with
respect
may
i
ask
he
said
diffidently
whether
you
are
a
pupil
of
bouguereau
i
she
said
in
some
surprise
then
she
looked
at
him
curiously
was
he
permitting
himself
the
liberty
of
joking
on
such
short
acquaintance
his
pleasant
serious
face
questioned
hers
tiens
she
thought
what
a
droll
man
you
surely
study
art
he
said
she
leaned
back
on
the
crooked
stick
of
her
parasol
and
looked
at
him
why
do
you
think
so
because
you
speak
as
if
you
did
you
are
making
fun
of
me
she
said
and
it
is
not
good
taste
she
stopped
confused
as
he
coloured
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
how
long
have
you
been
in
paris
she
said
at
length
three
days
he
replied
gravely
but--but--surely
you
are
not
a
nouveau
you
speak
french
too
well
then
after
a
pause
really
are
you
a
nouveau
i
am
he
said
she
sat
down
on
the
marble
bench
lately
occupied
by
clifford
and
tilting
her
parasol
over
her
small
head
looked
at
him
i
don't
believe
it
he
felt
the
compliment
and
for
a
moment
hesitated
to
declare
himself
one
of
the
despised
then
mustering
up
his
courage
he
told
her
how
new
and
green
he
was
and
all
with
a
frankness
which
made
her
blue
eyes
open
very
wide
and
her
lips
part
in
the
sweetest
of
smiles
you
have
never
seen
a
studio
never
nor
a
model
no
how
funny
she
said
solemnly
then
they
both
laughed
and
you
he
said
have
seen
studios
hundreds
and
models
millions
and
you
know
bouguereau
yes
and
henner
and
constant
and
laurens
and
puvis
de
chavannes
and
dagnan
and
courtois
and--and
all
the
rest
of
them
and
yet
you
say
you
are
not
an
artist
pardon
she
said
gravely
did
i
say
i
was
not
won't
you
tell
me
he
hesitated
at
first
she
looked
at
him
shaking
her
head
and
smiling
then
of
a
sudden
her
eyes
fell
and
she
began
tracing
figures
with
her
parasol
in
the
gravel
at
her
feet
hastings
had
taken
a
place
on
the
seat
and
now
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
sat
watching
the
spray
drifting
above
the
fountain
jet
a
small
boy
dressed
as
a
sailor
stood
poking
his
yacht
and
crying
i
won't
go
home
i
won't
go
home
his
nurse
raised
her
hands
to
heaven
just
like
a
little
american
boy
thought
hastings
and
a
pang
of
homesickness
shot
through
him
presently
the
nurse
captured
the
boat
and
the
small
boy
stood
at
bay
monsieur
renã©
when
you
decide
to
come
here
you
may
have
your
boat
the
boy
backed
away
scowling
give
me
my
boat
i
say
he
cried
and
don't
call
me
renã©
for
my
name's
randall
and
you
know
it
hello
said
hastings--randall--that's
english
i
am
american
announced
the
boy
in
perfectly
good
english
turning
to
look
at
hastings
and
she's
such
a
fool
she
calls
me
renã©
because
mamma
calls
me
ranny--
here
he
dodged
the
exasperated
nurse
and
took
up
his
station
behind
hastings
who
laughed
and
catching
him
around
the
waist
lifted
him
into
his
lap
one
of
my
countrymen
he
said
to
the
girl
beside
him
he
smiled
while
he
spoke
but
there
was
a
queer
feeling
in
his
throat
don't
you
see
the
stars
and
stripes
on
my
yacht
demanded
randall
sure
enough
the
american
colours
hung
limply
under
the
nurse's
arm
oh
cried
the
girl
he
is
charming
and
impulsively
stooped
to
kiss
him
but
the
infant
randall
wriggled
out
of
hastings'
arms
and
his
nurse
pounced
upon
him
with
an
angry
glance
at
the
girl
she
reddened
and
then
bit
her
lips
as
the
nurse
with
eyes
still
fixed
on
her
dragged
the
child
away
and
ostentatiously
wiped
his
lips
with
her
handkerchief
then
she
stole
a
look
at
hastings
and
bit
her
lip
again
what
an
ill-tempered
woman
he
said
in
america
most
nurses
are
flattered
when
people
kiss
their
children
for
an
instant
she
tipped
the
parasol
to
hide
her
face
then
closed
it
with
a
snap
and
looked
at
him
defiantly
do
you
think
it
strange
that
she
objected
why
not
he
said
in
surprise
again
she
looked
at
him
with
quick
searching
eyes
his
eyes
were
clear
and
bright
and
he
smiled
back
repeating
why
not
you
are
droll
she
murmured
bending
her
head
why
but
she
made
no
answer
and
sat
silent
tracing
curves
and
circles
in
the
dust
with
her
parasol
after
a
while
he
said--i
am
glad
to
see
that
young
people
have
so
much
liberty
here
i
understood
that
the
french
were
not
at
all
like
us
you
know
in
america--or
at
least
where
i
live
in
milbrook
girls
have
every
liberty--go
out
alone
and
receive
their
friends
alone
and
i
was
afraid
i
should
miss
it
here
but
i
see
how
it
is
now
and
i
am
glad
i
was
mistaken
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
and
kept
them
there
he
continued
pleasantly--since
i
have
sat
here
i
have
seen
a
lot
of
pretty
girls
walking
alone
on
the
terrace
there--and
then
you
are
alone
too
tell
me
for
i
do
not
know
french
customs--do
you
have
the
liberty
of
going
to
the
theatre
without
a
chaperone
for
a
long
time
she
studied
his
face
and
then
with
a
trembling
smile
said
why
do
you
ask
me
because
you
must
know
of
course
he
said
gaily
yes
she
replied
indifferently
i
know
he
waited
for
an
answer
but
getting
none
decided
that
perhaps
she
had
misunderstood
him
i
hope
you
don't
think
i
mean
to
presume
on
our
short
acquaintance
he
began--in
fact
it
is
very
odd
but
i
don't
know
your
name
when
mr
clifford
presented
me
he
only
mentioned
mine
is
that
the
custom
in
france
it
is
the
custom
in
the
latin
quarter
she
said
with
a
queer
light
in
her
eyes
then
suddenly
she
began
talking
almost
feverishly
you
must
know
monsieur
hastings
that
we
are
all
un
peu
sans
gãªne
here
in
the
latin
quarter
we
are
very
bohemian
and
etiquette
and
ceremony
are
out
of
place
it
was
for
that
monsieur
clifford
presented
you
to
me
with
small
ceremony
and
left
us
together
with
less--only
for
that
and
i
am
his
friend
and
i
have
many
friends
in
the
latin
quarter
and
we
all
know
each
other
very
well--and
i
am
not
studying
art
but--but--
but
what
he
said
bewildered
i
shall
not
tell
you--it
is
a
secret
she
said
with
an
uncertain
smile
on
both
cheeks
a
pink
spot
was
burning
and
her
eyes
were
very
bright
then
in
a
moment
her
face
fell
do
you
know
monsieur
clifford
very
intimately
not
very
after
a
while
she
turned
to
him
grave
and
a
little
pale
my
name
is
valentine--valentine
tissot
might--might
i
ask
a
service
of
you
on
such
very
short
acquaintance
oh
he
cried
i
should
be
honoured
it
is
only
this
she
said
gently
it
is
not
much
promise
me
not
to
speak
to
monsieur
clifford
about
me
promise
me
that
you
will
speak
to
no
one
about
me
i
promise
he
said
greatly
puzzled
she
laughed
nervously
i
wish
to
remain
a
mystery
it
is
a
caprice
but
he
began
i
had
wished
i
had
hoped
that
you
might
give
monsieur
clifford
permission
to
bring
me
to
present
me
at
your
house
my--my
house
she
repeated
i
mean
where
you
live
in
fact
to
present
me
to
your
family
the
change
in
the
girl's
face
shocked
him
i
beg
your
pardon
he
cried
i
have
hurt
you
and
as
quick
as
a
flash
she
understood
him
because
she
was
a
woman
my
parents
are
dead
she
said
presently
he
began
again
very
gently
would
it
displease
you
if
i
beg
you
to
receive
me
it
is
the
custom
i
cannot
she
answered
then
glancing
up
at
him
i
am
sorry
i
should
like
to
but
believe
me
i
cannot
he
bowed
seriously
and
looked
vaguely
uneasy
it
isn't
because
i
don't
wish
to
i--i
like
you
you
are
very
kind
to
me
kind
he
cried
surprised
and
puzzled
i
like
you
she
said
slowly
and
we
will
see
each
other
sometimes
if
you
will
at
friends'
houses
no
not
at
friends'
houses
where
here
she
said
with
defiant
eyes
why
he
cried
in
paris
you
are
much
more
liberal
in
your
views
than
we
are
she
looked
at
him
curiously
yes
we
are
very
bohemian
i
think
it
is
charming
he
declared
you
see
we
shall
be
in
the
best
of
society
she
ventured
timidly
with
a
pretty
gesture
toward
the
statues
of
the
dead
queens
ranged
in
stately
ranks
above
the
terrace
he
looked
at
her
delighted
and
she
brightened
at
the
success
of
her
innocent
little
pleasantry
indeed
she
smiled
i
shall
be
well
chaperoned
because
you
see
we
are
under
the
protection
of
the
gods
themselves
look
there
are
apollo
and
juno
and
venus
on
their
pedestals
counting
them
on
her
small
gloved
fingers
and
ceres
hercules
and--but
i
can't
make
out--
hastings
turned
to
look
up
at
the
winged
god
under
whose
shadow
they
were
seated
why
it's
love
he
said
iv
there
is
a
nouveau
here
drawled
laffat
leaning
around
his
easel
and
addressing
his
friend
bowles
there
is
a
nouveau
here
who
is
so
tender
and
green
and
appetizing
that
heaven
help
him
if
he
should
fall
into
a
salad
bowl
hayseed
inquired
bowles
plastering
in
a
background
with
a
broken
palette-knife
and
squinting
at
the
effect
with
approval
yes
squeedunk
or
oshkosh
and
how
he
ever
grew
up
among
the
daisies
and
escaped
the
cows
heaven
alone
knows
bowles
rubbed
his
thumb
across
the
outlines
of
his
study
to
throw
in
a
little
atmosphere
as
he
said
glared
at
the
model
pulled
at
his
pipe
and
finding
it
out
struck
a
match
on
his
neighbour's
back
to
relight
it
his
name
continued
laffat
hurling
a
bit
of
bread
at
the
hat-rack
his
name
is
hastings
he
is
a
berry
he
knows
no
more
about
the
world--and
here
mr
laffat's
face
spoke
volumes
for
his
own
knowledge
of
that
planet--than
a
maiden
cat
on
its
first
moonlight
stroll
bowles
now
having
succeeded
in
lighting
his
pipe
repeated
the
thumb
touch
on
the
other
edge
of
the
study
and
said
ah
yes
continued
his
friend
and
would
you
imagine
it
he
seems
to
think
that
everything
here
goes
on
as
it
does
in
his
d----d
little
backwoods
ranch
at
home
talks
about
the
pretty
girls
who
walk
alone
in
the
street
says
how
sensible
it
is
and
how
french
parents
are
misrepresented
in
america
says
that
for
his
part
he
finds
french
girls--and
he
confessed
to
only
knowing
one--as
jolly
as
american
girls
i
tried
to
set
him
right
tried
to
give
him
a
pointer
as
to
what
sort
of
ladies
walk
about
alone
or
with
students
and
he
was
either
too
stupid
or
too
innocent
to
catch
on
then
i
gave
it
to
him
straight
and
he
said
i
was
a
vile-minded
fool
and
marched
off
did
you
assist
him
with
your
shoe
inquired
bowles
languidly
interested
well
no
he
called
you
a
vile-minded
fool
he
was
correct
said
clifford
from
his
easel
in
front
what--what
do
you
mean
demanded
laffat
turning
red
that
replied
clifford
who
spoke
to
you
is
this
your
business
sneered
bowles
but
nearly
lost
his
balance
as
clifford
swung
about
and
eyed
him
yes
he
said
slowly
it's
my
business
no
one
spoke
for
some
time
then
clifford
sang
out
i
say
hastings
and
when
hastings
left
his
easel
and
came
around
he
nodded
toward
the
astonished
laffat
this
man
has
been
disagreeable
to
you
and
i
want
to
tell
you
that
any
time
you
feel
inclined
to
kick
him
why
i
will
hold
the
other
creature
hastings
embarrassed
said
why
no
i
don't
agree
with
his
ideas
nothing
more
clifford
said
naturally
and
slipping
his
arm
through
hastings'
strolled
about
with
him
and
introduced
him
to
several
of
his
own
friends
at
which
all
the
nouveaux
opened
their
eyes
with
envy
and
the
studio
were
given
to
understand
that
hastings
although
prepared
to
do
menial
work
as
the
latest
nouveau
was
already
within
the
charmed
circle
of
the
old
respected
and
feared
the
truly
great
the
rest
finished
the
model
resumed
his
place
and
work
went
on
in
a
chorus
of
songs
and
yells
and
every
ear-splitting
noise
which
the
art
student
utters
when
studying
the
beautiful
five
o'clock
struck--the
model
yawned
stretched
and
climbed
into
his
trousers
and
the
noisy
contents
of
six
studios
crowded
through
the
hall
and
down
into
the
street
ten
minutes
later
hastings
found
himself
on
top
of
a
montrouge
tram
and
shortly
afterward
was
joined
by
clifford
they
climbed
down
at
the
rue
gay
lussac
i
always
stop
here
observed
clifford
i
like
the
walk
through
the
luxembourg
by
the
way
said
hastings
how
can
i
call
on
you
when
i
don't
know
where
you
live
why
i
live
opposite
you
what--the
studio
in
the
garden
where
the
almond
trees
are
and
the
blackbirds--
exactly
said
clifford
i'm
with
my
friend
elliott
hastings
thought
of
the
description
of
the
two
american
artists
which
he
had
heard
from
miss
susie
byng
and
looked
blank
clifford
continued
perhaps
you
had
better
let
me
know
when
you
think
of
coming
so--so
that
i
will
be
sure
to--to
be
there
he
ended
rather
lamely
i
shouldn't
care
to
meet
any
of
your
model
friends
there
said
hastings
smiling
you
know--my
ideas
are
rather
straitlaced--i
suppose
you
would
say
puritanical
i
shouldn't
enjoy
it
and
wouldn't
know
how
to
behave
oh
i
understand
said
clifford
but
added
with
great
cordiality--i'm
sure
we'll
be
friends
although
you
may
not
approve
of
me
and
my
set
but
you
will
like
severn
and
selby
because--because
well
they
are
like
yourself
old
chap
after
a
moment
he
continued
there
is
something
i
want
to
speak
about
you
see
when
i
introduced
you
last
week
in
the
luxembourg
to
valentine--
not
a
word
cried
hastings
smiling
you
must
not
tell
me
a
word
of
her
why--
no--not
a
word
he
said
gaily
i
insist--promise
me
upon
your
honour
you
will
not
speak
of
her
until
i
give
you
permission
promise
i
promise
said
clifford
amazed
she
is
a
charming
girl--we
had
such
a
delightful
chat
after
you
left
and
i
thank
you
for
presenting
me
but
not
another
word
about
her
until
i
give
you
permission
oh
murmured
clifford
remember
your
promise
he
smiled
as
he
turned
into
his
gateway
clifford
strolled
across
the
street
and
traversing
the
ivy-covered
alley
entered
his
garden
he
felt
for
his
studio
key
muttering
i
wonder--i
wonder--but
of
course
he
doesn't
he
entered
the
hallway
and
fitting
the
key
into
the
door
stood
staring
at
the
two
cards
tacked
over
the
panels
foxhall
clifford
richard
osborne
elliott
why
the
devil
doesn't
he
want
me
to
speak
of
her
he
opened
the
door
and
discouraging
the
caresses
of
two
brindle
bull-dogs
sank
down
on
the
sofa
elliott
sat
smoking
and
sketching
with
a
piece
of
charcoal
by
the
window
hello
he
said
without
looking
around
clifford
gazed
absently
at
the
back
of
his
head
murmuring
i'm
afraid
i'm
afraid
that
man
is
too
innocent
i
say
elliott
he
said
at
last
hastings--you
know
the
chap
that
old
tabby
byram
came
around
here
to
tell
us
about--the
day
you
had
to
hide
colette
in
the
armoire--
yes
what's
up
oh
nothing
he's
a
brick
yes
said
elliott
without
enthusiasm
don't
you
think
so
demanded
clifford
why
yes
but
he
is
going
to
have
a
tough
time
when
some
of
his
illusions
are
dispelled
more
shame
to
those
who
dispel
'em
yes--wait
until
he
comes
to
pay
his
call
on
us
unexpectedly
of
course--
clifford
looked
virtuous
and
lighted
a
cigar
i
was
just
going
to
say
he
observed
that
i
have
asked
him
not
to
come
without
letting
us
know
so
i
can
postpone
any
orgie
you
may
have
intended--
ah
cried
elliott
indignantly
i
suppose
you
put
it
to
him
in
that
way
not
exactly
grinned
clifford
then
more
seriously
i
don't
want
anything
to
occur
here
to
bother
him
he's
a
brick
and
it's
a
pity
we
can't
be
more
like
him
i
am
observed
elliott
complacently
only
living
with
you--
listen
cried
the
other
i
have
managed
to
put
my
foot
in
it
in
great
style
do
you
know
what
i've
done
well--the
first
time
i
met
him
in
the
street--or
rather
it
was
in
the
luxembourg
i
introduced
him
to
valentine
did
he
object
believe
me
said
clifford
solemnly
this
rustic
hastings
has
no
more
idea
that
valentine
is--is--in
fact
is
valentine
than
he
has
that
he
himself
is
a
beautiful
example
of
moral
decency
in
a
quarter
where
morals
are
as
rare
as
elephants
i
heard
enough
in
a
conversation
between
that
blackguard
loffat
and
the
little
immoral
eruption
bowles
to
open
my
eyes
i
tell
you
hastings
is
a
trump
he's
a
healthy
clean-minded
young
fellow
bred
in
a
small
country
village
brought
up
with
the
idea
that
saloons
are
way-stations
to
hell--and
as
for
women--
well
demanded
elliott
well
said
clifford
his
idea
of
the
dangerous
woman
is
probably
a
painted
jezabel
probably
replied
the
other
he's
a
trump
said
clifford
and
if
he
swears
the
world
is
as
good
and
pure
as
his
own
heart
i'll
swear
he's
right
elliott
rubbed
his
charcoal
on
his
file
to
get
a
point
and
turned
to
his
sketch
saying
he
will
never
hear
any
pessimism
from
richard
osborne
e
he's
a
lesson
to
me
said
clifford
then
he
unfolded
a
small
perfumed
note
written
on
rose-coloured
paper
which
had
been
lying
on
the
table
before
him
he
read
it
smiled
whistled
a
bar
or
two
from
miss
helyett
and
sat
down
to
answer
it
on
his
best
cream-laid
note-paper
when
it
was
written
and
sealed
he
picked
up
his
stick
and
marched
up
and
down
the
studio
two
or
three
times
whistling
going
out
inquired
the
other
without
turning
yes
he
said
but
lingered
a
moment
over
elliott's
shoulder
watching
him
pick
out
the
lights
in
his
sketch
with
a
bit
of
bread
to-morrow
is
sunday
he
observed
after
a
moment's
silence
well
inquired
elliott
have
you
seen
colette
no
i
will
to-night
she
and
rowden
and
jacqueline
are
coming
to
boulant's
i
suppose
you
and
cã©cile
will
be
there
well
no
replied
clifford
cã©cile
dines
at
home
to-night
and
i--i
had
an
idea
of
going
to
mignon's
elliott
looked
at
him
with
disapproval
you
can
make
all
the
arrangements
for
la
roche
without
me
he
continued
avoiding
elliott's
eyes
what
are
you
up
to
now
nothing
protested
clifford
don't
tell
me
replied
his
chum
with
scorn
fellows
don't
rush
off
to
mignon's
when
the
set
dine
at
boulant's
who
is
it
now--but
no
i
won't
ask
that--what's
the
use
then
he
lifted
up
his
voice
in
complaint
and
beat
upon
the
table
with
his
pipe
what's
the
use
of
ever
trying
to
keep
track
of
you
what
will
cã©cile
say--oh
yes
what
will
she
say
it's
a
pity
you
can't
be
constant
two
months
yes
by
jove
and
the
quarter
is
indulgent
but
you
abuse
its
good
nature
and
mine
too
presently
he
arose
and
jamming
his
hat
on
his
head
marched
to
the
door
heaven
alone
knows
why
any
one
puts
up
with
your
antics
but
they
all
do
and
so
do
i
if
i
were
cã©cile
or
any
of
the
other
pretty
fools
after
whom
you
have
toddled
and
will
in
all
human
probabilities
continue
to
toddle
i
say
if
i
were
cã©cile
i'd
spank
you
now
i'm
going
to
boulant's
and
as
usual
i
shall
make
excuses
for
you
and
arrange
the
affair
and
i
don't
care
a
continental
where
you
are
going
but
by
the
skull
of
the
studio
skeleton
if
you
don't
turn
up
to-morrow
with
your
sketching-kit
under
one
arm
and
cã©cile
under
the
other--if
you
don't
turn
up
in
good
shape
i'm
done
with
you
and
the
rest
can
think
what
they
please
good-night
clifford
said
good-night
with
as
pleasant
a
smile
as
he
could
muster
and
then
sat
down
with
his
eyes
on
the
door
he
took
out
his
watch
and
gave
elliott
ten
minutes
to
vanish
then
rang
the
concierge's
call
murmuring
oh
dear
oh
dear
why
the
devil
do
i
do
it
alfred
he
said
as
that
gimlet-eyed
person
answered
the
call
make
yourself
clean
and
proper
alfred
and
replace
your
sabots
with
a
pair
of
shoes
then
put
on
your
best
hat
and
take
this
letter
to
the
big
white
house
in
the
rue
de
dragon
there
is
no
answer
mon
petit
alfred
the
concierge
departed
with
a
snort
in
which
unwillingness
for
the
errand
and
affection
for
m
clifford
were
blended
then
with
great
care
the
young
fellow
arrayed
himself
in
all
the
beauties
of
his
and
elliott's
wardrobe
he
took
his
time
about
it
and
occasionally
interrupted
his
toilet
to
play
his
banjo
or
make
pleasing
diversion
for
the
bull-dogs
by
gambling
about
on
all
fours
i've
got
two
hours
before
me
he
thought
and
borrowed
a
pair
of
elliott's
silken
foot-gear
with
which
he
and
the
dogs
played
ball
until
he
decided
to
put
them
on
then
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
inspected
his
dress-coat
when
he
had
emptied
it
of
four
handkerchiefs
a
fan
and
a
pair
of
crumpled
gloves
as
long
as
his
arm
he
decided
it
was
not
suited
to
add
ã©clat
to
his
charms
and
cast
about
in
his
mind
for
a
substitute
elliott
was
too
thin
and
anyway
his
coats
were
now
under
lock
and
key
rowden
probably
was
as
badly
off
as
himself
hastings
hastings
was
the
man
but
when
he
threw
on
a
smoking-jacket
and
sauntered
over
to
hastings'
house
he
was
informed
that
he
had
been
gone
over
an
hour
now
where
in
the
name
of
all
that's
reasonable
could
he
have
gone
muttered
clifford
looking
down
the
street
the
maid
didn't
know
so
he
bestowed
upon
her
a
fascinating
smile
and
lounged
back
to
the
studio
hastings
was
not
far
away
the
luxembourg
is
within
five
minutes'
walk
of
the
rue
notre
dame
des
champs
and
there
he
sat
under
the
shadow
of
a
winged
god
and
there
he
had
sat
for
an
hour
poking
holes
in
the
dust
and
watching
the
steps
which
lead
from
the
northern
terrace
to
the
fountain
the
sun
hung
a
purple
globe
above
the
misty
hills
of
meudon
long
streamers
of
clouds
touched
with
rose
swept
low
on
the
western
sky
and
the
dome
of
the
distant
invalides
burned
like
an
opal
through
the
haze
behind
the
palace
the
smoke
from
a
high
chimney
mounted
straight
into
the
air
purple
until
it
crossed
the
sun
where
it
changed
to
a
bar
of
smouldering
fire
high
above
the
darkening
foliage
of
the
chestnuts
the
twin
towers
of
st
sulpice
rose
an
ever-deepening
silhouette
a
sleepy
blackbird
was
carolling
in
some
near
thicket
and
pigeons
passed
and
repassed
with
the
whisper
of
soft
winds
in
their
wings
the
light
on
the
palace
windows
had
died
away
and
the
dome
of
the
pantheon
swam
aglow
above
the
northern
terrace
a
fiery
valhalla
in
the
sky
while
below
in
grim
array
along
the
terrace
ranged
the
marble
ranks
of
queens
looked
out
into
the
west
from
the
end
of
the
long
walk
by
the
northern
faã§ade
of
the
palace
came
the
noise
of
omnibuses
and
the
cries
of
the
street
hastings
looked
at
the
palace
clock
six
and
as
his
own
watch
agreed
with
it
he
fell
to
poking
holes
in
the
gravel
again
a
constant
stream
of
people
passed
between
the
odã©on
and
the
fountain
priests
in
black
with
silver-buckled
shoes
line
soldiers
slouchy
and
rakish
neat
girls
without
hats
bearing
milliners'
boxes
students
with
black
portfolios
and
high
hats
students
with
bã©rets
and
big
canes
nervous
quick-stepping
officers
symphonies
in
turquoise
and
silver
ponderous
jangling
cavalrymen
all
over
dust
pastry
cooks'
boys
skipping
along
with
utter
disregard
for
the
safety
of
the
basket
balanced
on
the
impish
head
and
then
the
lean
outcast
the
shambling
paris
tramp
slouching
with
shoulders
bent
and
little
eye
furtively
scanning
the
ground
for
smokers'
refuse--all
these
moved
in
a
steady
stream
across
the
fountain
circle
and
out
into
the
city
by
the
odeon
whose
long
arcades
were
now
beginning
to
flicker
with
gas-jets
the
melancholy
bells
of
st
sulpice
struck
the
hour
and
the
clock-tower
of
the
palace
lighted
up
then
hurried
steps
sounded
across
the
gravel
and
hastings
raised
his
head
how
late
you
are
he
said
but
his
voice
was
hoarse
and
only
his
flushed
face
told
how
long
had
seemed
the
waiting
she
said
i
was
kept--indeed
i
was
so
much
annoyed--and--and
i
may
only
stay
a
moment
she
sat
down
beside
him
casting
a
furtive
glance
over
her
shoulder
at
the
god
upon
his
pedestal
what
a
nuisance
that
intruding
cupid
still
there
wings
and
arrows
too
said
hastings
unheeding
her
motion
to
be
seated
wings
she
murmured
oh
yes--to
fly
away
with
when
he's
tired
of
his
play
of
course
it
was
a
man
who
conceived
the
idea
of
wings
otherwise
cupid
would
have
been
insupportable
do
you
think
so
ma
foi
it's
what
men
think
and
women
oh
she
said
with
a
toss
of
her
small
head
i
really
forget
what
we
were
speaking
of
we
were
speaking
of
love
said
hastings
i
was
not
said
the
girl
then
looking
up
at
the
marble
god
i
don't
care
for
this
one
at
all
i
don't
believe
he
knows
how
to
shoot
his
arrows--no
indeed
he
is
a
coward--he
creeps
up
like
an
assassin
in
the
twilight
i
don't
approve
of
cowardice
she
announced
and
turned
her
back
on
the
statue
i
think
said
hastings
quietly
that
he
does
shoot
fairly--yes
and
even
gives
one
warning
is
it
your
experience
monsieur
hastings
he
looked
straight
into
her
eyes
and
said
he
is
warning
me
heed
the
warning
then
she
cried
with
a
nervous
laugh
as
she
spoke
she
stripped
off
her
gloves
and
then
carefully
proceeded
to
draw
them
on
again
when
this
was
accomplished
she
glanced
at
the
palace
clock
saying
oh
dear
how
late
it
is
furled
her
umbrella
then
unfurled
it
and
finally
looked
at
him
no
he
said
i
shall
not
heed
his
warning
oh
dear
she
sighed
again
still
talking
about
that
tiresome
statue
then
stealing
a
glance
at
his
face
i
suppose--i
suppose
you
are
in
love
i
don't
know
he
muttered
i
suppose
i
am
she
raised
her
head
with
a
quick
gesture
you
seem
delighted
at
the
idea
she
said
but
bit
her
lip
and
trembled
as
his
eyes
met
hers
then
sudden
fear
came
over
her
and
she
sprang
up
staring
into
the
gathering
shadows
are
you
cold
he
said
but
she
only
answered
oh
dear
oh
dear
it
is
late--so
late
i
must
go--good-night
she
gave
him
her
gloved
hand
a
moment
and
then
withdrew
it
with
a
start
what
is
it
he
insisted
are
you
frightened
she
looked
at
him
strangely
no--no--not
frightened--you
are
very
good
to
me--
by
jove
he
burst
out
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
i'm
good
to
you
that's
at
least
the
third
time
and
i
don't
understand
the
sound
of
a
drum
from
the
guard-house
at
the
palace
cut
him
short
listen
she
whispered
they
are
going
to
close
it's
late
oh
so
late
the
rolling
of
the
drum
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
then
the
silhouette
of
the
drummer
cut
the
sky
above
the
eastern
terrace
the
fading
light
lingered
a
moment
on
his
belt
and
bayonet
then
he
passed
into
the
shadows
drumming
the
echoes
awake
the
roll
became
fainter
along
the
eastern
terrace
then
grew
and
grew
and
rattled
with
increasing
sharpness
when
he
passed
the
avenue
by
the
bronze
lion
and
turned
down
the
western
terrace
walk
louder
and
louder
the
drum
sounded
and
the
echoes
struck
back
the
notes
from
the
grey
palace
wall
and
now
the
drummer
loomed
up
before
them--his
red
trousers
a
dull
spot
in
the
gathering
gloom
the
brass
of
his
drum
and
bayonet
touched
with
a
pale
spark
his
epaulettes
tossing
on
his
shoulders
he
passed
leaving
the
crash
of
the
drum
in
their
ears
and
far
into
the
alley
of
trees
they
saw
his
little
tin
cup
shining
on
his
haversack
then
the
sentinels
began
the
monotonous
cry
on
ferme
on
ferme
and
the
bugle
blew
from
the
barracks
in
the
rue
de
tournon
on
ferme
on
ferme
good-night
she
whispered
i
must
return
alone
to-night
he
watched
her
until
she
reached
the
northern
terrace
and
then
sat
down
on
the
marble
seat
until
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
a
glimmer
of
bayonets
warned
him
away
she
passed
on
through
the
grove
and
turning
into
the
rue
de
medici
traversed
it
to
the
boulevard
at
the
corner
she
bought
a
bunch
of
violets
and
walked
on
along
the
boulevard
to
the
rue
des
ãcoles
a
cab
was
drawn
up
before
boulant's
and
a
pretty
girl
aided
by
elliott
jumped
out
valentine
cried
the
girl
come
with
us
i
can't
she
said
stopping
a
moment--i
have
a
rendezvous
at
mignon's
not
victor
cried
the
girl
laughing
but
she
passed
with
a
little
shiver
nodding
good-night
then
turning
into
the
boulevard
st
germain
she
walked
a
tittle
faster
to
escape
a
gay
party
sitting
before
the
cafã©
cluny
who
called
to
her
to
join
them
at
the
door
of
the
restaurant
mignon
stood
a
coal-black
negro
in
buttons
he
took
off
his
peaked
cap
as
she
mounted
the
carpeted
stairs
send
eugene
to
me
she
said
at
the
office
and
passing
through
the
hallway
to
the
right
of
the
dining-room
stopped
before
a
row
of
panelled
doors
a
waiter
passed
and
she
repeated
her
demand
for
eugene
who
presently
appeared
noiselessly
skipping
and
bowed
murmuring
madame
who
is
here
no
one
in
the
cabinets
madame
in
the
half
madame
madelon
and
monsieur
gay
monsieur
de
clamart
monsieur
clisson
madame
marie
and
their
set
then
he
looked
around
and
bowing
again
murmured
monsieur
awaits
madame
since
half
an
hour
and
he
knocked
at
one
of
the
panelled
doors
bearing
the
number
six
clifford
opened
the
door
and
the
girl
entered
the
garã§on
bowed
her
in
and
whispering
will
monsieur
have
the
goodness
to
ring
vanished
he
helped
her
off
with
her
jacket
and
took
her
hat
and
umbrella
when
she
was
seated
at
the
little
table
with
clifford
opposite
she
smiled
and
leaned
forward
on
both
elbows
looking
him
in
the
face
what
are
you
doing
here
she
demanded
waiting
he
replied
in
accents
of
adoration
for
an
instant
she
turned
and
examined
herself
in
the
glass
the
wide
blue
eyes
the
curling
hair
the
straight
nose
and
short
curled
lip
flashed
in
the
mirror
an
instant
only
and
then
its
depths
reflected
her
pretty
neck
and
back
thus
do
i
turn
my
back
on
vanity
she
said
and
then
leaning
forward
again
what
are
you
doing
here
waiting
for
you
repeated
clifford
slightly
troubled
and
cã©cile
now
don't
valentine--
do
you
know
she
said
calmly
i
dislike
your
conduct
he
was
a
little
disconcerted
and
rang
for
eugene
to
cover
his
confusion
the
soup
was
bisque
and
the
wine
pommery
and
the
courses
followed
each
other
with
the
usual
regularity
until
eugene
brought
coffee
and
there
was
nothing
left
on
the
table
but
a
small
silver
lamp
valentine
said
clifford
after
having
obtained
permission
to
smoke
is
it
the
vaudeville
or
the
eldorado--or
both
or
the
nouveau
cirque
or--
it
is
here
said
valentine
well
he
said
greatly
flattered
i'm
afraid
i
couldn't
amuse
you--
oh
yes
you
are
funnier
than
the
eldorado
now
see
here
don't
guy
me
valentine
you
always
do
and
and--you
know
what
they
say--a
good
laugh
kills--
what
er--er--love
and
all
that
she
laughed
until
her
eyes
were
moist
with
tears
tiens
she
cried
he
is
dead
then
clifford
eyed
her
with
growing
alarm
do
you
know
why
i
came
she
said
no
he
replied
uneasily
i
don't
how
long
have
you
made
love
to
me
well
he
admitted
somewhat
startled--i
should
say--for
about
a
year
it
is
a
year
i
think
are
you
not
tired
he
did
not
answer
don't
you
know
that
i
like
you
too
well
to--to
ever
fall
in
love
with
you
she
said
don't
you
know
that
we
are
too
good
comrades--too
old
friends
for
that
and
were
we
not--do
you
think
that
i
do
not
know
your
history
monsieur
clifford
don't
be--don't
be
so
sarcastic
he
urged
don't
be
unkind
valentine
i'm
not
i'm
kind
i'm
very
kind--to
you
and
to
cã©cile
cã©cile
is
tired
of
me
i
hope
she
is
said
the
girl
for
she
deserves
a
better
fate
tiens
do
you
know
your
reputation
in
the
quarter
of
the
inconstant
the
most
inconstant--utterly
incorrigible
and
no
more
serious
than
a
gnat
on
a
summer
night
poor
cã©cile
clifford
looked
so
uncomfortable
that
she
spoke
more
kindly
i
like
you
you
know
that
everybody
does
you
are
a
spoiled
child
here
everything
is
permitted
you
and
every
one
makes
allowance
but
every
one
cannot
be
a
victim
to
caprice
caprice
he
cried
by
jove
if
the
girls
of
the
latin
quarter
are
not
capricious--
never
mind--never
mind
about
that
you
must
not
sit
in
judgment--you
of
all
men
why
are
you
here
to-night
oh
she
cried
i
will
tell
you
why
monsieur
receives
a
little
note
he
sends
a
little
answer
he
dresses
in
his
conquering
raiment--
i
don't
said
clifford
very
red
you
do
and
it
becomes
you
she
retorted
with
a
faint
smile
then
again
very
quietly
i
am
in
your
power
but
i
know
i
am
in
the
power
of
a
friend
i
have
come
to
acknowledge
it
to
you
here--and
it
is
because
of
that
that
i
am
here
to
beg
of
you--a--a
favour
clifford
opened
his
eyes
but
said
nothing
i
am
in--great
distress
of
mind
it
is
monsieur
hastings
well
said
clifford
in
some
astonishment
i
want
to
ask
you
she
continued
in
a
low
voice
i
want
to
ask
you
to--to--in
case
you
should
speak
of
me
before
him--not
to
say--not
to
say--
i
shall
not
speak
of
you
to
him
he
said
quietly
can--can
you
prevent
others
i
might
if
i
was
present
may
i
ask
why
that
is
not
fair
she
murmured
you
know
how--how
he
considers
me--as
he
considers
every
woman
you
know
how
different
he
is
from
you
and
the
rest
i
have
never
seen
a
man--such
a
man
as
monsieur
hastings
he
let
his
cigarette
go
out
unnoticed
i
am
almost
afraid
of
him--afraid
he
should
know--what
we
all
are
in
the
quarter
oh
i
do
not
wish
him
to
know
i
do
not
wish
him
to--to
turn
from
me--to
cease
from
speaking
to
me
as
he
does
you--you
and
the
rest
cannot
know
what
it
has
been
to
me
i
could
not
believe
him--i
could
not
believe
he
was
so
good
and--and
noble
i
do
not
wish
him
to
know--so
soon
he
will
find
out--sooner
or
later
he
will
find
out
for
himself
and
then
he
will
turn
away
from
me
why
she
cried
passionately
why
should
he
turn
from
me
and
not
from
you
clifford
much
embarrassed
eyed
his
cigarette
the
girl
rose
very
white
he
is
your
friend--you
have
a
right
to
warn
him
he
is
my
friend
he
said
at
length
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
then
she
cried
by
all
that
i
hold
to
me
most
sacred
you
need
not
warn
him
i
shall
trust
your
word
he
said
pleasantly
v
the
month
passed
quickly
for
hastings
and
left
few
definite
impressions
after
it
it
did
leave
some
however
one
was
a
painful
impression
of
meeting
mr
bladen
on
the
boulevard
des
capucines
in
company
with
a
very
pronounced
young
person
whose
laugh
dismayed
him
and
when
at
last
he
escaped
from
the
cafã©
where
mr
bladen
had
hauled
him
to
join
them
in
a
bock
he
felt
as
if
the
whole
boulevard
was
looking
at
him
and
judging
him
by
his
company
later
an
instinctive
conviction
regarding
the
young
person
with
mr
bladen
sent
the
hot
blood
into
his
cheek
and
he
returned
to
the
pension
in
such
a
miserable
state
of
mind
that
miss
byng
was
alarmed
and
advised
him
to
conquer
his
homesickness
at
once
another
impression
was
equally
vivid
one
saturday
morning
feeling
lonely
his
wanderings
about
the
city
brought
him
to
the
gare
st
lazare
it
was
early
for
breakfast
but
he
entered
the
hã´tel
terminus
and
took
a
table
near
the
window
as
he
wheeled
about
to
give
his
order
a
man
passing
rapidly
along
the
aisle
collided
with
his
head
and
looking
up
to
receive
the
expected
apology
he
was
met
instead
by
a
slap
on
the
shoulder
and
a
hearty
what
the
deuce
are
you
doing
here
old
chap
it
was
rowden
who
seized
him
and
told
him
to
come
along
so
mildly
protesting
he
was
ushered
into
a
private
dining-room
where
clifford
rather
red
jumped
up
from
the
table
and
welcomed
him
with
a
startled
air
which
was
softened
by
the
unaffected
glee
of
rowden
and
the
extreme
courtesy
of
elliott
the
latter
presented
him
to
three
bewitching
girls
who
welcomed
him
so
charmingly
and
seconded
rowden
in
his
demand
that
hastings
should
make
one
of
the
party
that
he
consented
at
once
while
elliott
briefly
outlined
the
projected
excursion
to
la
roche
hastings
delightedly
ate
his
omelet
and
returned
the
smiles
of
encouragement
from
cã©cile
and
colette
and
jacqueline
meantime
clifford
in
a
bland
whisper
was
telling
rowden
what
an
ass
he
was
poor
rowden
looked
miserable
until
elliott
divining
how
affairs
were
turning
frowned
on
clifford
and
found
a
moment
to
let
rowden
know
that
they
were
all
going
to
make
the
best
of
it
you
shut
up
he
observed
to
clifford
it's
fate
and
that
settles
it
it's
rowden
and
that
settles
it
murmured
clifford
concealing
a
grin
for
after
all
he
was
not
hastings'
wet
nurse
so
it
came
about
that
the
train
which
left
the
gare
st
lazare
at
915
am
stopped
a
moment
in
its
career
towards
havre
and
deposited
at
the
red-roofed
station
of
la
roche
a
merry
party
armed
with
sunshades
trout-rods
and
one
cane
carried
by
the
non-combatant
hastings
then
when
they
had
established
their
camp
in
a
grove
of
sycamores
which
bordered
the
little
river
ept
clifford
the
acknowledged
master
of
all
that
pertained
to
sportsmanship
took
command
you
rowden
he
said
divide
your
flies
with
elliott
and
keep
an
eye
on
him
or
else
he'll
be
trying
to
put
on
a
float
and
sinker
prevent
him
by
force
from
grubbing
about
for
worms
elliott
protested
but
was
forced
to
smile
in
the
general
laugh
you
make
me
ill
he
asserted
do
you
think
this
is
my
first
trout
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
your
first
trout
said
clifford
and
dodging
a
fly
hook
hurled
with
intent
to
hit
proceeded
to
sort
and
equip
three
slender
rods
destined
to
bring
joy
and
fish
to
cã©cil
colette
and
jacqueline
with
perfect
gravity
he
ornamented
each
line
with
four
split
shot
a
small
hook
and
a
brilliant
quill
float
i
shall
never
touch
the
worms
announced
cã©cile
with
a
shudder
jacqueline
and
colette
hastened
to
sustain
her
and
hastings
pleasantly
offered
to
act
in
the
capacity
of
general
baiter
and
taker-off
of
fish
but
cã©cile
doubtless
fascinated
by
the
gaudy
flies
in
clifford's
book
decided
to
accept
lessons
from
him
in
the
true
art
and
presently
disappeared
up
the
ept
with
clifford
in
tow
elliott
looked
doubtfully
at
colette
i
prefer
gudgeons
said
that
damsel
with
decision
and
you
and
monsieur
rowden
may
go
away
when
you
please
may
they
not
jacqueline
certainly
responded
jacqueline
elliott
undecided
examined
his
rod
and
reel
you've
got
your
reel
on
wrong
side
up
observed
rowden
elliott
wavered
and
stole
a
glance
at
colette
i--i--have
almost
decided
to--er--not
to
flip
the
flies
about
just
now
he
began
there's
the
pole
that
cã©cile
left--
don't
call
it
a
pole
corrected
rowden
rod
then
continued
elliott
and
started
off
in
the
wake
of
the
two
girls
but
was
promptly
collared
by
rowden
no
you
don't
fancy
a
man
fishing
with
a
float
and
sinker
when
he
has
a
fly
rod
in
his
hand
you
come
along
where
the
placid
little
ept
flows
down
between
its
thickets
to
the
seine
a
grassy
bank
shadows
the
haunt
of
the
gudgeon
and
on
this
bank
sat
colette
and
jacqueline
and
chattered
and
laughed
and
watched
the
swerving
of
the
scarlet
quills
while
hastings
his
hat
over
his
eyes
his
head
on
a
bank
of
moss
listened
to
their
soft
voices
and
gallantly
unhooked
the
small
and
indignant
gudgeon
when
a
flash
of
a
rod
and
a
half-suppressed
scream
announced
a
catch
the
sunlight
filtered
through
the
leafy
thickets
awaking
to
song
the
forest
birds
magpies
in
spotless
black
and
white
flirted
past
alighting
near
by
with
a
hop
and
bound
and
twitch
of
the
tail
blue
and
white
jays
with
rosy
breasts
shrieked
through
the
trees
and
a
low-sailing
hawk
wheeled
among
the
fields
of
ripening
wheat
putting
to
flight
flocks
of

across
the

a
gull
dropped
on
the

like

the
air
was

and
still
scarcely
a
leaf
moved
sounds
from
a
distant
farm
came
faintly
the

cock-crow
and

a

ploughed
up

its

odour
of

hastings
was
thinking
of
valentine
it
was
two
o'clock
when
elliott
strolled
back
and
frankly
admitting
that
he
had
eluded
rowden
sat
down
beside
colette
and
prepared
to
doze
with
satisfaction
where
are
your
trout
said
colette
severely
they
still
live
murmured
elliott
and
went
fast
asleep
rowden
returned
shortly
after
and
casting
a
scornful
glance
at
the
slumbering
one
displayed
three
crimson-flecked
trout
and
that
smiled
hastings
lazily
that
is
the
holy
end
to
which
the
faithful
plod--the
slaughter
of
these
small
fish
with
a
bit
of
silk
and
feather
rowden
disdained
to
answer
him
colette
caught
another
gudgeon
and
awoke
elliott
who
protested
and
gazed
about
for
the
lunch
baskets
as
clifford
and
cã©cile
came
up
demanding
instant
refreshment
cã©cile's
skirts
were
soaked
and
her
gloves
torn
but
she
was
happy
and
clifford
dragging
out
a
two-pound
trout
stood
still
to
receive
the
applause
of
the
company
where
the
deuce
did
you
get
that
demanded
elliott
cã©cile
wet
and
enthusiastic
recounted
the
battle
and
then
clifford
eulogized
her
powers
with
the
fly
and
in
proof
produced
from
his
creel
a
defunct
chub
which
he
observed
just
missed
being
a
trout
they
were
all
very
happy
at
luncheon
and
hastings
was
voted
charming
he
enjoyed
it
immensely--only
it
seemed
to
him
at
moments
that
flirtation
went
further
in
france
than
in
millbrook
connecticut
and
he
thought
that
cã©cile
might
be
a
little
less
enthusiastic
about
clifford
that
perhaps
it
would
be
quite
as
well
if
jacqueline
sat
further
away
from
rowden
and
that
possibly
colette
could
have
for
a
moment
at
least
taken
her
eyes
from
elliott's
face
still
he
enjoyed
it--except
when
his
thoughts
drifted
to
valentine
and
then
he
felt
that
he
was
very
far
away
from
her
la
roche
is
at
least
an
hour
and
a
half
from
paris
it
is
also
true
that
he
felt
a
happiness
a
quick
heart-beat
when
at
eight
o'clock
that
night
the
train
which
bore
them
from
la
roche
rolled
into
the
gare
st
lazare
and
he
was
once
more
in
the
city
of
valentine
good-night
they
said
pressing
around
him
you
must
come
with
us
next
time
he
promised
and
watched
them
two
by
two
drift
into
the
darkening
city
and
stood
so
long
that
when
again
he
raised
his
eyes
the
vast
boulevard
was
twinkling
with
gas-jets
through
which
the
electric
lights
stared
like
moons
vi
it
was
with
another
quick
heart-beat
that
he
awoke
next
morning
for
his
first
thought
was
of
valentine
the
sun
already
gilded
the
towers
of
notre
dame
the
clatter
of
workmen's
sabots
awoke
sharp
echoes
in
the
street
below
and
across
the
way
a
blackbird
in
a
pink
almond
tree
was
going
into
an
ecstasy
of
trills
he
determined
to
awake
clifford
for
a
brisk
walk
in
the
country
hoping
later
to
beguile
that
gentleman
into
the
american
church
for
his
soul's
sake
he
found
alfred
the
gimlet-eyed
washing
the
asphalt
walk
which
led
to
the
studio
monsieur
elliott
he
replied
to
the
perfunctory
inquiry
je
ne
sais
pas
and
monsieur
clifford
began
hastings
somewhat
astonished
monsieur
clifford
said
the
concierge
with
fine
irony
will
be
pleased
to
see
you
as
he
retired
early
in
fact
he
has
just
come
in
hastings
hesitated
while
the
concierge
pronounced
a
fine
eulogy
on
people
who
never
stayed
out
all
night
and
then
came
battering
at
the
lodge
gate
during
hours
which
even
a
gendarme
held
sacred
to
sleep
he
also
discoursed
eloquently
upon
the
beauties
of
temperance
and
took
an
ostentatious
draught
from
the
fountain
in
the
court
i
do
not
think
i
will
come
in
said
hastings
pardon
monsieur
growled
the
concierge
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
see
monsieur
clifford
he
possibly
needs
aid
me
he
drives
forth
with
hair-brushes
and
boots
it
is
a
mercy
if
he
has
not
set
fire
to
something
with
his
candle
hastings
hesitated
for
an
instant
but
swallowing
his
dislike
of
such
a
mission
walked
slowly
through
the
ivy-covered
alley
and
across
the
inner
garden
to
the
studio
he
knocked
perfect
silence
then
he
knocked
again
and
this
time
something
struck
the
door
from
within
with
a
crash
that
said
the
concierge
was
a
boot
he
fitted
his
duplicate
key
into
the
lock
and
ushered
hastings
in
clifford
in
disordered
evening
dress
sat
on
the
rug
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
held
in
his
hand
a
shoe
and
did
not
appear
astonished
to
see
hastings
good-morning
do
you
use
pears'
soap
he
inquired
with
a
vague
wave
of
his
hand
and
a
vaguer
smile
hastings'
heart
sank
for
heaven's
sake
he
said
clifford
go
to
bed
not
while
that--that
alfred
pokes
his
shaggy
head
in
here
an'
i
have
a
shoe
left
hastings
blew
out
the
candle
picked
up
clifford's
hat
and
cane
and
said
with
an
emotion
he
could
not
conceal
this
is
terrible
clifford--i--never
knew
you
did
this
sort
of
thing
well
i
do
said
clifford
where
is
elliott
ole
chap
returned
clifford
becoming
maudlin
providence
which
feeds--feeds--er--sparrows
an'
that
sort
of
thing
watcheth
over
the
intemperate
wanderer--
where
is
elliott
but
clifford
only
wagged
his
head
and
waved
his
arm
about
he's
out
there--somewhere
about
then
suddenly
feeling
a
desire
to
see
his
missing
chum
lifted
up
his
voice
and
howled
for
him
hastings
thoroughly
shocked
sat
down
on
the
lounge
without
a
word
presently
after
shedding
several
scalding
tears
clifford
brightened
up
and
rose
with
great
precaution
ole
chap
he
observed
do
you
want
to
see
er--er
miracle
well
here
goes
i'm
goin'
to
begin
he
paused
beaming
at
vacancy
er
miracle
he
repeated
hastings
supposed
he
was
alluding
to
the
miracle
of
his
keeping
his
balance
and
said
nothing
i'm
goin'
to
bed
he
announced
poor
ole
clifford's
goin'
to
bed
an'
that's
er
miracle
and
he
did
with
a
nice
calculation
of
distance
and
equilibrium
which
would
have
rung
enthusiastic
yells
of
applause
from
elliott
had
he
been
there
to
assist
en
connaisseur
but
he
was
not
he
had
not
yet
reached
the
studio
he
was
on
his
way
however
and
smiled
with
magnificent
condescension
on
hastings
who
half
an
hour
later
found
him
reclining
upon
a
bench
in
the
luxembourg
he
permitted
himself
to
be
aroused
dusted
and
escorted
to
the
gate
here
however
he
refused
all
further
assistance
and
bestowing
a
patronizing
bow
upon
hastings
steered
a
tolerably
true
course
for
the
rue
vavin
hastings
watched
him
out
of
sight
and
then
slowly
retraced
his
steps
toward
the
fountain
at
first
he
felt
gloomy
and
depressed
but
gradually
the
clear
air
of
the
morning
lifted
the
pressure
from
his
heart
and
he
sat
down
on
the
marble
seat
under
the
shadow
of
the
winged
god
the
air
was
fresh
and
sweet
with
perfume
from
the
orange
flowers
everywhere
pigeons
were
bathing
dashing
the
water
over
their
iris-hued
breasts
flashing
in
and
out
of
the
spray
or
nestling
almost
to
the
neck
along
the
polished
basin
the
sparrows
too
were
abroad
in
force
soaking
their
dust-coloured
feathers
in
the
limpid
pool
and
chirping
with
might
and
main
under
the
sycamores
which
surrounded
the
duck-pond
opposite
the
fountain
of
marie
de
medici
the
water-fowl
cropped
the
herbage
or
waddled
in
rows
down
the
bank
to
embark
on
some
solemn
aimless
cruise
butterflies
somewhat
lame
from
a
chilly
night's
repose
under
the
lilac
leaves
crawled
over
and
over
the
white
phlox
or
took
a
rheumatic
flight
toward
some
sun-warmed
shrub
the
bees
were
already
busy
among
the
heliotrope
and
one
or
two
grey
flies
with
brick-coloured
eyes
sat
in
a
spot
of
sunlight
beside
the
marble
seat
or
chased
each
other
about
only
to
return
again
to
the
spot
of
sunshine
and
rub
their
fore-legs
exulting
the
sentries
paced
briskly
before
the
painted
boxes
pausing
at
times
to
look
toward
the
guard-house
for
their
relief
they
came
at
last
with
a
shuffle
of
feet
and
click
of
bayonets
the
word
was
passed
the
relief
fell
out
and
away
they
went
crunch
crunch
across
the
gravel
a
mellow
chime
floated
from
the
clock-tower
of
the
palace
the
deep
bell
of
st
sulpice
echoed
the
stroke
hastings
sat
dreaming
in
the
shadow
of
the
god
and
while
he
mused
somebody
came
and
sat
down
beside
him
at
first
he
did
not
raise
his
head
it
was
only
when
she
spoke
that
he
sprang
up
you
at
this
hour
i
was
restless
i
could
not
sleep
then
in
a
low
happy
voice--and
you
at
this
hour
i--i
slept
but
the
sun
awoke
me
i
could
not
sleep
she
said
and
her
eyes
seemed
for
a
moment
touched
with
an
indefinable
shadow
then
smiling
i
am
so
glad--i
seemed
to
know
you
were
coming
don't
laugh
i
believe
in
dreams
did
you
really
dream
of--of
my
being
here
i
think
i
was
awake
when
i
dreamed
it
she
admitted
then
for
a
time
they
were
mute
acknowledging
by
silence
the
happiness
of
being
together
and
after
all
their
silence
was
eloquent
for
faint
smiles
and
glances
born
of
their
thoughts
crossed
and
recrossed
until
lips
moved
and
words
were
formed
which
seemed
almost
superfluous
what
they
said
was
not
very
profound
perhaps
the
most
valuable
jewel
that
fell
from
hastings'
lips
bore
direct
reference
to
breakfast
i
have
not
yet
had
my
chocolate
she
confessed
but
what
a
material
man
you
are
valentine
he
said
impulsively
i
wish--i
do
wish
that
you
would--just
for
this
once--give
me
the
whole
day--just
for
this
once
oh
dear
she
smiled
not
only
material
but
selfish
not
selfish
hungry
he
said
looking
at
her
a
cannibal
too
oh
dear
will
you
valentine
but
my
chocolate--
take
it
with
me
but
dã©jeuner--
together
at
st
cloud
but
i
can't--
together--all
day--all
day
long
will
you
valentine
she
was
silent
only
for
this
once
again
that
indefinable
shadow
fell
across
her
eyes
and
when
it
was
gone
she
sighed
yes--together
only
for
this
once
all
day
he
said
doubting
his
happiness
all
day
she
smiled
and
oh
i
am
so
hungry
he
laughed
enchanted
what
a
material
young
lady
it
is
on
the
boulevard
st
michel
there
is
a
crã©merie
painted
white
and
blue
outside
and
neat
and
clean
as
a
whistle
inside
the
auburn-haired
young
woman
who
speaks
french
like
a
native
and
rejoices
in
the
name
of
murphy
smiled
at
them
as
they
entered
and
tossing
a
fresh
napkin
over
the
zinc
tãªte-ã
-tãªte
table
whisked
before
them
two
cups
of
chocolate
and
a
basket
full
of
crisp
fresh
croissons
the
primrose-coloured
pats
of
butter
each
stamped
with
a
shamrock
in
relief
seemed
saturated
with
the
fragrance
of
normandy
pastures
how
delicious
they
said
in
the
same
breath
and
then
laughed
at
the
coincidence
with
but
a
single
thought
he
began
how
absurd
she
cried
with
cheeks
all
rosy
i'm
thinking
i'd
like
a
croisson
so
am
i
he
replied
triumphant
that
proves
it
then
they
had
a
quarrel
she
accusing
him
of
behaviour
unworthy
of
a
child
in
arms
and
he
denying
it
and
bringing
counter
charges
until
mademoiselle
murphy
laughed
in
sympathy
and
the
last
croisson
was
eaten
under
a
flag
of
truce
then
they
rose
and
she
took
his
arm
with
a
bright
nod
to
mile
murphy
who
cried
them
a
merry
bonjour
madame
bonjour
monsieur
and
watched
them
hail
a
passing
cab
and
drive
away
dieu
qu'il
est
beau
she
sighed
adding
after
a
moment
do
they
be
married
i
dunno--ma
foi
ils
ont
bien
l'air
the
cab
swung
around
the
rue
de
medici
turned
into
the
rue
de
vaugirard
followed
it
to
where
it
crosses
the
rue
de
rennes
and
taking
that
noisy
thoroughfare
drew
up
before
the
gare
montparnasse
they
were
just
in
time
for
a
train
and
scampered
up
the
stairway
and
out
to
the
cars
as
the
last
note
from
the
starting-gong
rang
through
the
arched
station
the
guard
slammed
the
door
of
their
compartment
a
whistle
sounded
answered
by
a
screech
from
the
locomotive
and
the
long
train
glided
from
the
station
faster
faster
and
sped
out
into
the
morning
sunshine
the
summer
wind
blew
in
their
faces
from
the
open
window
and
sent
the
soft
hair
dancing
on
the
girl's
forehead
we
have
the
compartment
to
ourselves
said
hastings
she
leaned
against
the
cushioned
window-seat
her
eyes
bright
and
wide
open
her
lips
parted
the
wind
lifted
her
hat
and
fluttered
the
ribbons
under
her
chin
with
a
quick
movement
she
untied
them
and
drawing
a
long
hat-pin
from
her
hat
laid
it
down
on
the
seat
beside
her
the
train
was
flying
the
colour
surged
in
her
cheeks
and
with
each
quick-drawn
breath
her
breath
rose
and
fell
under
the
cluster
of
lilies
at
her
throat
trees
houses
ponds
danced
past
cut
by
a
mist
of
telegraph
poles
faster
faster
she
cried
his
eyes
never
left
her
but
hers
wide
open
and
blue
as
the
summer
sky
seemed
fixed
on
something
far
ahead--something
which
came
no
nearer
but
fled
before
them
as
they
fled
was
it
the
horizon
cut
now
by
the
grim
fortress
on
the
hill
now
by
the
cross
of
a
country
chapel
was
it
the
summer
moon
ghost-like
slipping
through
the
vaguer
blue
above
faster
faster
she
cried
her
parted
lips
burned
scarlet
the
car
shook
and
shivered
and
the
fields
streamed
by
like
an
emerald
torrent
he
caught
the
excitement
and
his
faced
glowed
oh
she
cried
and
with
an
unconscious
movement
caught
his
hand
drawing
him
to
the
window
beside
her
look
lean
out
with
me
he
only
saw
her
lips
move
her
voice
was
drowned
in
the
roar
of
a
trestle
but
his
hand
closed
in
hers
and
he
clung
to
the
sill
the
wind
whistled
in
their
ears
not
so
far
out
valentine
take
care
he
gasped
below
through
the
ties
of
the
trestle
a
broad
river
flashed
into
view
and
out
again
as
the
train
thundered
along
a
tunnel
and
away
once
more
through
the
freshest
of
green
fields
the
wind
roared
about
them
the
girl
was
leaning
far
out
from
the
window
and
he
caught
her
by
the
waist
crying
not
too
far
but
she
only
murmured
faster
faster
away
out
of
the
city
out
of
the
land
faster
faster
away
out
of
the
world
what
are
you
saying
all
to
yourself
he
said
but
his
voice
was
broken
and
the
wind
whirled
it
back
into
his
throat
she
heard
him
and
turning
from
the
window
looked
down
at
his
arm
about
her
then
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
the
car
shook
and
the
windows
rattled
they
were
dashing
through
a
forest
now
and
the
sun
swept
the
dewy
branches
with
running
flashes
of
fire
he
looked
into
her
troubled
eyes
he
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
the
half-parted
lips
and
she
cried
out
a
bitter
hopeless
cry
not
that--not
that
but
he
held
her
close
and
strong
whispering
words
of
honest
love
and
passion
and
when
she
sobbed--not
that--not
that--i
have
promised
you
must--you
must
know--i
am--not--worthy--
in
the
purity
of
his
own
heart
her
words
were
to
him
meaningless
then
meaningless
for
ever
after
presently
her
voice
ceased
and
her
head
rested
on
his
breast
he
leaned
against
the
window
his
ears
swept
by
the
furious
wind
his
heart
in
a
joyous
tumult
the
forest
was
passed
and
the
sun
slipped
from
behind
the
trees
flooding
the
earth
again
with
brightness
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
out
into
the
world
from
the
window
then
she
began
to
speak
but
her
voice
was
faint
and
he
bent
his
head
close
to
hers
and
listened
i
cannot
turn
from
you
i
am
too
weak
you
were
long
ago
my
master--master
of
my
heart
and
soul
i
have
broken
my
word
to
one
who
trusted
me
but
i
have
told
you
all--what
matters
the
rest
he
smiled
at
her
innocence
and
she
worshipped
his
she
spoke
again
take
me
or
cast
me
away--what
matters
it
now
with
a
word
you
can
kill
me
and
it
might
be
easier
to
die
than
to
look
upon
happiness
as
great
as
mine
he
took
her
in
his
arms
hush
what
are
you
saying
look--look
out
at
the
sunlight
the
meadows
and
the
streams
we
shall
be
very
happy
in
so
bright
a
world
she
turned
to
the
sunlight
from
the
window
the
world
below
seemed
very
fair
to
her
trembling
with
happiness
she
sighed
is
this
the
world
then
i
have
never
known
it
nor
have
i
god
forgive
me
he
murmured
perhaps
it
was
our
gentle
lady
of
the
fields
who
forgave
them
both
rue
barrãe
for
let
philosopher
and
doctor
preach
of
what
they
will
and
what
they
will
not--each
is
but
one
link
in
an
eternal
chain
that
none
can
slip
nor
break
nor
over-reach
crimson
nor
yellow
roses
nor
the
savour
of
the
mounting
sea
are
worth
the
perfume
i
adore
that
clings
to
thee
the
languid-headed
lilies
tire
the
changeless
waters
weary
me
i
ache
with
passionate
desire
of
thine
and
thee
there
are
but
these
things
in
the
world--
thy
mouth
of
fire
thy
breasts
thy
hands
thy
hair
upcurled
and
my
desire
i
one
morning
at
julian's
a
student
said
to
selby
that
is
foxhall
clifford
pointing
with
his
brushes
at
a
young
man
who
sat
before
an
easel
doing
nothing
selby
shy
and
nervous
walked
over
and
began
my
name
is
selby--i
have
just
arrived
in
paris
and
bring
a
letter
of
introduction--
his
voice
was
lost
in
the
crash
of
a
falling
easel
the
owner
of
which
promptly
assaulted
his
neighbour
and
for
a
time
the
noise
of
battle
rolled
through
the
studios
of
mm
boulanger
and
lefebvre
presently
subsiding
into
a
scuffle
on
the
stairs
outside
selby
apprehensive
as
to
his
own
reception
in
the
studio
looked
at
clifford
who
sat
serenely
watching
the
fight
it's
a
little
noisy
here
said
clifford
but
you
will
like
the
fellows
when
you
know
them
his
unaffected
manner
delighted
selby
then
with
a
simplicity
that
won
his
heart
he
presented
him
to
half
a
dozen
students
of
as
many
nationalities
some
were
cordial
all
were
polite
even
the
majestic
creature
who
held
the
position
of
massier
unbent
enough
to
say
my
friend
when
a
man
speaks
french
as
well
as
you
do
and
is
also
a
friend
of
monsieur
clifford
he
will
have
no
trouble
in
this
studio
you
expect
of
course
to
fill
the
stove
until
the
next
new
man
comes
of
course
and
you
don't
mind
chaff
no
replied
selby
who
hated
it
clifford
much
amused
put
on
his
hat
saying
you
must
expect
lots
of
it
at
first
selby
placed
his
own
hat
on
his
head
and
followed
him
to
the
door
as
they
passed
the
model
stand
there
was
a
furious
cry
of
chapeau
chapeau
and
a
student
sprang
from
his
easel
menacing
selby
who
reddened
but
looked
at
clifford
take
off
your
hat
for
them
said
the
latter
laughing
a
little
embarrassed
he
turned
and
saluted
the
studio
et
moi
cried
the
model
you
are
charming
replied
selby
astonished
at
his
own
audacity
but
the
studio
rose
as
one
man
shouting
he
has
done
well
he's
all
right
while
the
model
laughing
kissed
her
hand
to
him
and
cried
ã
demain
beau
jeune
homme
all
that
week
selby
worked
at
the
studio
unmolested
the
french
students
christened
him
l'enfant
prodigue
which
was
freely
translated
the
prodigious
infant
the
kid
kid
selby
and
kidby
but
the
disease
soon
ran
its
course
from
kidby
to
kidney
and
then
naturally
to
tidbits
where
it
was
arrested
by
clifford's
authority
and
ultimately
relapsed
to
kid
wednesday
came
and
with
it
m
boulanger
for
three
hours
the
students
writhed
under
his
biting
sarcasms--among
the
others
clifford
who
was
informed
that
he
knew
even
less
about
a
work
of
art
than
he
did
about
the
art
of
work
selby
was
more
fortunate
the
professor
examined
his
drawing
in
silence
looked
at
him
sharply
and
passed
on
with
a
non-committal
gesture
he
presently
departed
arm
in
arm
with
bouguereau
to
the
relief
of
clifford
who
was
then
at
liberty
to
jam
his
hat
on
his
head
and
depart
the
next
day
he
did
not
appear
and
selby
who
had
counted
on
seeing
him
at
the
studio
a
thing
which
he
learned
later
it
was
vanity
to
count
on
wandered
back
to
the
latin
quarter
alone
paris
was
still
strange
and
new
to
him
he
was
vaguely
troubled
by
its
splendour
no
tender
memories
stirred
his
american
bosom
at
the
place
du
chã¢telet
nor
even
by
notre
dame
the
palais
de
justice
with
its
clock
and
turrets
and
stalking
sentinels
in
blue
and
vermilion
the
place
st
michel
with
its
jumble
of
omnibuses
and
ugly
water-spitting
griffins
the
hill
of
the
boulevard
st
michel
the
tooting
trams
the
policemen
dawdling
two
by
two
and
the
table-lined
terraces
of
the
cafã©
vacehett
were
nothing
to
him
as
yet
nor
did
he
even
know
when
he
stepped
from
the
stones
of
the
place
st
michel
to
the
asphalt
of
the
boulevard
that
he
had
crossed
the
frontier
and
entered
the
student
zone--the
famous
latin
quarter
a
cabman
hailed
him
as
bourgeois
and
urged
the
superiority
of
driving
over
walking
a
gamin
with
an
appearance
of
great
concern
requested
the
latest
telegraphic
news
from
london
and
then
standing
on
his
head
invited
selby
to
feats
of
strength
a
pretty
girl
gave
him
a
glance
from
a
pair
of
violet
eyes
he
did
not
see
her
but
she
catching
her
own
reflection
in
a
window
wondered
at
the
colour
burning
in
her
cheeks
turning
to
resume
her
course
she
met
foxhall
clifford
and
hurried
on
clifford
open-mouthed
followed
her
with
his
eyes
then
he
looked
after
selby
who
had
turned
into
the
boulevard
st
germain
toward
the
rue
de
seine
then
he
examined
himself
in
the
shop
window
the
result
seemed
to
be
unsatisfactory
i'm
not
a
beauty
he
mused
but
neither
am
i
a
hobgoblin
what
does
she
mean
by
blushing
at
selby
i
never
before
saw
her
look
at
a
fellow
in
my
life--neither
has
any
one
in
the
quarter
anyway
i
can
swear
she
never
looks
at
me
and
goodness
knows
i
have
done
all
that
respectful
adoration
can
do
he
sighed
and
murmuring
a
prophecy
concerning
the
salvation
of
his
immortal
soul
swung
into
that
graceful
lounge
which
at
all
times
characterized
clifford
with
no
apparent
exertion
he
overtook
selby
at
the
corner
and
together
they
crossed
the
sunlit
boulevard
and
sat
down
under
the
awning
of
the
cafã©
du
cercle
clifford
bowed
to
everybody
on
the
terrace
saying
you
shall
meet
them
all
later
but
now
let
me
present
you
to
two
of
the
sights
of
paris
mr
richard
elliott
and
mr
stanley
rowden
the
sights
looked
amiable
and
took
vermouth
you
cut
the
studio
to-day
said
elliott
suddenly
turning
on
clifford
who
avoided
his
eyes
to
commune
with
nature
observed
rowden
what's
her
name
this
time
asked
elliott
and
rowden
answered
promptly
name
yvette
nationality
breton--
wrong
replied
clifford
blandly
it's
rue
barrã©e
the
subject
changed
instantly
and
selby
listened
in
surprise
to
names
which
were
new
to
him
and
eulogies
on
the
latest
prix
de
rome
winner
he
was
delighted
to
hear
opinions
boldly
expressed
and
points
honestly
debated
although
the
vehicle
was
mostly
slang
both
english
and
french
he
longed
for
the
time
when
he
too
should
be
plunged
into
the
strife
for
fame
the
bells
of
st
sulpice
struck
the
hour
and
the
palace
of
the
luxembourg
answered
chime
on
chime
with
a
glance
at
the
sun
dipping
low
in
the
golden
dust
behind
the
palais
bourbon
they
rose
and
turning
to
the
east
crossed
the
boulevard
st
germain
and
sauntered
toward
the
ãcole
de
mã©decine
at
the
corner
a
girl
passed
them
walking
hurriedly
clifford
smirked
elliot
and
rowden
were
agitated
but
they
all
bowed
and
without
raising
her
eyes
she
returned
their
salute
but
selby
who
had
lagged
behind
fascinated
by
some
gay
shop
window
looked
up
to
meet
two
of
the
bluest
eyes
he
had
ever
seen
the
eyes
were
dropped
in
an
instant
and
the
young
fellow
hastened
to
overtake
the
others
by
jove
he
said
do
you
fellows
know
i
have
just
seen
the
prettiest
girl--
an
exclamation
broke
from
the
trio
gloomy
foreboding
like
the
chorus
in
a
greek
play
rue
barrã©e
what
cried
selby
bewildered
the
only
answer
was
a
vague
gesture
from
clifford
two
hours
later
during
dinner
clifford
turned
to
selby
and
said
you
want
to
ask
me
something
i
can
tell
by
the
way
you
fidget
about
yes
i
do
he
said
innocently
enough
it's
about
that
girl
who
is
she
in
rowden's
smile
there
was
pity
in
elliott's
bitterness
her
name
said
clifford
solemnly
is
unknown
to
any
one
at
least
he
added
with
much
conscientiousness
as
far
as
i
can
learn
every
fellow
in
the
quarter
bows
to
her
and
she
returns
the
salute
gravely
but
no
man
has
ever
been
known
to
obtain
more
than
that
her
profession
judging
from
her
music-roll
is
that
of
a
pianist
her
residence
is
in
a
small
and
humble
street
which
is
kept
in
a
perpetual
process
of
repair
by
the
city
authorities
and
from
the
black
letters
painted
on
the
barrier
which
defends
the
street
from
traffic
she
has
taken
the
name
by
which
we
know
her--rue
barrã©e
mr
rowden
in
his
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
french
tongue
called
our
attention
to
it
as
roo
barry--
i
didn't
said
rowden
hotly
and
roo
barry
or
rue
barrã©e
is
to-day
an
object
of
adoration
to
every
rapin
in
the
quarter--
we
are
not
rapins
corrected
elliott
i
am
not
returned
clifford
and
i
beg
to
call
to
your
attention
selby
that
these
two
gentlemen
have
at
various
and
apparently
unfortunate
moments
offered
to
lay
down
life
and
limb
at
the
feet
of
rue
barrã©e
the
lady
possesses
a
chilling
smile
which
she
uses
on
such
occasions
and
here
he
became
gloomily
impressive
i
have
been
forced
to
believe
that
neither
the
scholarly
grace
of
my
friend
elliott
nor
the
buxom
beauty
of
my
friend
rowden
have
touched
that
heart
of
ice
elliott
and
rowden
boiling
with
indignation
cried
out
and
you
i
said
clifford
blandly
do
fear
to
tread
where
you
rush
in
ii
twenty-four
hours
later
selby
had
completely
forgotten
rue
barrã©e
during
the
week
he
worked
with
might
and
main
at
the
studio
and
saturday
night
found
him
so
tired
that
he
went
to
bed
before
dinner
and
had
a
nightmare
about
a
river
of
yellow
ochre
in
which
he
was
drowning
sunday
morning
apropos
of
nothing
at
all
he
thought
of
rue
barrã©e
and
ten
seconds
afterwards
he
saw
her
it
was
at
the
flower-market
on
the
marble
bridge
she
was
examining
a
pot
of
pansies
the
gardener
had
evidently
thrown
heart
and
soul
into
the
transaction
but
rue
barrã©e
shook
her
head
it
is
a
question
whether
selby
would
have
stopped
then
and
there
to
inspect
a
cabbage-rose
had
not
clifford
unwound
for
him
the
yarn
of
the
previous
tuesday
it
is
possible
that
his
curiosity
was
piqued
for
with
the
exception
of
a
hen-turkey
a
boy
of
nineteen
is
the
most
openly
curious
biped
alive
from
twenty
until
death
he
tries
to
conceal
it
but
to
be
fair
to
selby
it
is
also
true
that
the
market
was
attractive
under
a
cloudless
sky
the
flowers
were
packed
and
heaped
along
the
marble
bridge
to
the
parapet
the
air
was
soft
the
sun
spun
a
shadowy
lacework
among
the
palms
and
glowed
in
the
hearts
of
a
thousand
roses
spring
had
come--was
in
full
tide
the
watering
carts
and
sprinklers
spread
freshness
over
the
boulevard
the
sparrows
had
become
vulgarly
obtrusive
and
the
credulous
seine
angler
anxiously
followed
his
gaudy
quill
floating
among
the
soapsuds
of
the
lavoirs
the
white-spiked
chestnuts
clad
in
tender
green
vibrated
with
the
hum
of
bees
shoddy
butterflies
flaunted
their
winter
rags
among
the
heliotrope
there
was
a
smell
of
fresh
earth
in
the
air
an
echo
of
the
woodland
brook
in
the
ripple
of
the
seine
and
swallows
soared
and
skimmed
among
the
anchored
river
craft
somewhere
in
a
window
a
caged
bird
was
singing
its
heart
out
to
the
sky
selby
looked
at
the
cabbage-rose
and
then
at
the
sky
something
in
the
song
of
the
caged
bird
may
have
moved
him
or
perhaps
it
was
that
dangerous
sweetness
in
the
air
of
may
at
first
he
was
hardly
conscious
that
he
had
stopped
then
he
was
scarcely
conscious
why
he
had
stopped
then
he
thought
he
would
move
on
then
he
thought
he
wouldn't
then
he
looked
at
rue
barrã©e
the
gardener
said
mademoiselle
this
is
undoubtedly
a
fine
pot
of
pansies
rue
barrã©e
shook
her
head
the
gardener
smiled
she
evidently
did
not
want
the
pansies
she
had
bought
many
pots
of
pansies
there
two
or
three
every
spring
and
never
argued
what
did
she
want
then
the
pansies
were
evidently
a
feeler
toward
a
more
important
transaction
the
gardener
rubbed
his
hands
and
gazed
about
him
these
tulips
are
magnificent
he
observed
and
these
hyacinths--
he
fell
into
a
trance
at
the
mere
sight
of
the
scented
thickets
that
murmured
rue
pointing
to
a
splendid
rose-bush
with
her
furled
parasol
but
in
spite
of
her
her
voice
trembled
a
little
selby
noticed
it
more
shame
to
him
that
he
was
listening
and
the
gardener
noticed
it
and
burying
his
nose
in
the
roses
scented
a
bargain
still
to
do
him
justice
he
did
not
add
a
centime
to
the
honest
value
of
the
plant
for
after
all
rue
was
probably
poor
and
any
one
could
see
she
was
charming
fifty
francs
mademoiselle
the
gardener's
tone
was
grave
rue
felt
that
argument
would
be
wasted
they
both
stood
silent
for
a
moment
the
gardener
did
not
eulogize
his
prize--the
rose-tree
was
gorgeous
and
any
one
could
see
it
i
will
take
the
pansies
said
the
girl
and
drew
two
francs
from
a
worn
purse
then
she
looked
up
a
tear-drop
stood
in
the
way
refracting
the
light
like
a
diamond
but
as
it
rolled
into
a
little
corner
by
her
nose
a
vision
of
selby
replaced
it
and
when
a
brush
of
the
handkerchief
had
cleared
the
startled
blue
eyes
selby
himself
appeared
very
much
embarrassed
he
instantly
looked
up
into
the
sky
apparently
devoured
with
a
thirst
for
astronomical
research
and
as
he
continued
his
investigations
for
fully
five
minutes
the
gardener
looked
up
too
and
so
did
a
policeman
then
selby
looked
at
the
tips
of
his
boots
the
gardener
looked
at
him
and
the
policeman
slouched
on
rue
barrã©e
had
been
gone
some
time
what
said
the
gardener
may
i
offer
monsieur
selby
never
knew
why
but
he
suddenly
began
to
buy
flowers
the
gardener
was
electrified
never
before
had
he
sold
so
many
flowers
never
at
such
satisfying
prices
and
never
never
with
such
absolute
unanimity
of
opinion
with
a
customer
but
he
missed
the
bargaining
the
arguing
the
calling
of
heaven
to
witness
the
transaction
lacked
spice
these
tulips
are
magnificent
they
are
cried
selby
warmly
but
alas
they
are
dear
i
will
take
them
dieu
murmured
the
gardener
in
a
perspiration
he's
madder
than
most
englishmen
this
cactus--
is
gorgeous
alas--
send
it
with
the
rest
the
gardener
braced
himself
against
the
river
wall
that
splendid
rose-bush
he
began
faintly
that
is
a
beauty
i
believe
it
is
fifty
francs--
he
stopped
very
red
the
gardener
relished
his
confusion
then
a
sudden
cool
self-possession
took
the
place
of
his
momentary
confusion
and
he
held
the
gardener
with
his
eye
and
bullied
him
i'll
take
that
bush
why
did
not
the
young
lady
buy
it
mademoiselle
is
not
wealthy
how
do
you
know
dame
i
sell
her
many
pansies
pansies
are
not
expensive
those
are
the
pansies
she
bought
these
monsieur
the
blue
and
gold
then
you
intend
to
send
them
to
her
at
mid-day
after
the
market
take
this
rose-bush
with
them
and--here
he
glared
at
the
gardener--don't
you
dare
say
from
whom
they
came
the
gardener's
eyes
were
like
saucers
but
selby
calm
and
victorious
said
send
the
others
to
the
hã´tel
du
sã©nat
7
rue
de
tournon
i
will
leave
directions
with
the
concierge
then
he
buttoned
his
glove
with
much
dignity
and
stalked
off
but
when
well
around
the
corner
and
hidden
from
the
gardener's
view
the
conviction
that
he
was
an
idiot
came
home
to
him
in
a
furious
blush
ten
minutes
later
he
sat
in
his
room
in
the
hã´tel
du
sã©nat
repeating
with
an
imbecile
smile
what
an
ass
i
am
what
an
ass
an
hour
later
found
him
in
the
same
chair
in
the
same
position
his
hat
and
gloves
still
on
his
stick
in
his
hand
but
he
was
silent
apparently
lost
in
contemplation
of
his
boot
toes
and
his
smile
was
less
imbecile
and
even
a
bit
retrospective
iii
about
five
o'clock
that
afternoon
the
little
sad-eyed
woman
who
fills
the
position
of
concierge
at
the
hã´tel
du
sã©nat
held
up
her
hands
in
amazement
to
see
a
wagon-load
of
flower-bearing
shrubs
draw
up
before
the
doorway
she
called
joseph
the
intemperate
garã§on
who
while
calculating
the
value
of
the
flowers
in
petits
verres
gloomily
disclaimed
any
knowledge
as
to
their
destination
voyons
said
the
little
concierge
cherchons
la
femme
you
he
suggested
the
little
woman
stood
a
moment
pensive
and
then
sighed
joseph
caressed
his
nose
a
nose
which
for
gaudiness
could
vie
with
any
floral
display
then
the
gardener
came
in
hat
in
hand
and
a
few
minutes
later
selby
stood
in
the
middle
of
his
room
his
coat
off
his
shirt-sleeves
rolled
up
the
chamber
originally
contained
besides
the
furniture
about
two
square
feet
of
walking
room
and
now
this
was
occupied
by
a
cactus
the
bed
groaned
under
crates
of
pansies
lilies
and
heliotrope
the
lounge
was
covered
with
hyacinths
and
tulips
and
the
washstand
supported
a
species
of
young
tree
warranted
to
bear
flowers
at
some
time
or
other
clifford
came
in
a
little
later
fell
over
a
box
of
sweet
peas
swore
a
little
apologized
and
then
as
the
full
splendour
of
the
floral
fãªte
burst
upon
him
sat
down
in
astonishment
upon
a
geranium
the
geranium
was
a
wreck
but
selby
said
don't
mind
and
glared
at
the
cactus
are
you
going
to
give
a
ball
demanded
clifford
n--no--i'm
very
fond
of
flowers
said
selby
but
the
statement
lacked
enthusiasm
i
should
imagine
so
then
after
a
silence
that's
a
fine
cactus
selby
contemplated
the
cactus
touched
it
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
and
pricked
his
thumb
clifford
poked
a
pansy
with
his
stick
then
joseph
came
in
with
the
bill
announcing
the
sum
total
in
a
loud
voice
partly
to
impress
clifford
partly
to
intimidate
selby
into
disgorging
a
pourboire
which
he
would
share
if
he
chose
with
the
gardener
clifford
tried
to
pretend
that
he
had
not
heard
while
selby
paid
bill
and
tribute
without
a
murmur
then
he
lounged
back
into
the
room
with
an
attempt
at
indifference
which
failed
entirely
when
he
tore
his
trousers
on
the
cactus
clifford
made
some
commonplace
remark
lighted
a
cigarette
and
looked
out
of
the
window
to
give
selby
a
chance
selby
tried
to
take
it
but
getting
as
far
as--yes
spring
is
here
at
last
froze
solid
he
looked
at
the
back
of
clifford's
head
it
expressed
volumes
those
little
perked-up
ears
seemed
tingling
with
suppressed
glee
he
made
a
desperate
effort
to
master
the
situation
and
jumped
up
to
reach
for
some
russian
cigarettes
as
an
incentive
to
conversation
but
was
foiled
by
the
cactus
to
whom
again
he
fell
a
prey
the
last
straw
was
added
damn
the
cactus
this
observation
was
wrung
from
selby
against
his
will--against
his
own
instinct
of
self-preservation
but
the
thorns
on
the
cactus
were
long
and
sharp
and
at
their
repeated
prick
his
pent-up
wrath
escaped
it
was
too
late
now
it
was
done
and
clifford
had
wheeled
around
see
here
selby
why
the
deuce
did
you
buy
those
flowers
i'm
fond
of
them
said
selby
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
you
can't
sleep
here
i
could
if
you'd
help
me
take
the
pansies
off
the
bed
where
can
you
put
them
couldn't
i
give
them
to
the
concierge
as
soon
as
he
said
it
he
regretted
it
what
in
heaven's
name
would
clifford
think
of
him
he
had
heard
the
amount
of
the
bill
would
he
believe
that
he
had
invested
in
these
luxuries
as
a
timid
declaration
to
his
concierge
and
would
the
latin
quarter
comment
upon
it
in
their
own
brutal
fashion
he
dreaded
ridicule
and
he
knew
clifford's
reputation
then
somebody
knocked
selby
looked
at
clifford
with
a
hunted
expression
which
touched
that
young
man's
heart
it
was
a
confession
and
at
the
same
time
a
supplication
clifford
jumped
up
threaded
his
way
through
the
floral
labyrinth
and
putting
an
eye
to
the
crack
of
the
door
said
who
the
devil
is
it
this
graceful
style
of
reception
is
indigenous
to
the
quarter
it's
elliott
he
said
looking
back
and
rowden
too
and
their
bulldogs
then
he
addressed
them
through
the
crack
sit
down
on
the
stairs
selby
and
i
are
coming
out
directly
discretion
is
a
virtue
the
latin
quarter
possesses
few
and
discretion
seldom
figures
on
the
list
they
sat
down
and
began
to
whistle
presently
rowden
called
out
i
smell
flowers
they
feast
within
you
ought
to
know
selby
better
than
that
growled
clifford
behind
the
door
while
the
other
hurriedly
exchanged
his
torn
trousers
for
others
we
know
selby
said
elliott
with
emphasis
yes
said
rowden
he
gives
receptions
with
floral
decorations
and
invites
clifford
while
we
sit
on
the
stairs
yes
while
the
youth
and
beauty
of
the
quarter
revel
suggested
rowden
then
with
sudden
misgiving
is
odette
there
see
here
demanded
elliott
is
colette
there
then
he
raised
his
voice
in
a
plaintive
howl
are
you
there
colette
while
i'm
kicking
my
heels
on
these
tiles
clifford
is
capable
of
anything
said
rowden
his
nature
is
soured
since
rue
barrã©e
sat
on
him
elliott
raised
his
voice
i
say
you
fellows
we
saw
some
flowers
carried
into
rue
barrã©e's
house
at
noon
posies
and
roses
specified
rowden
probably
for
her
added
elliott
caressing
his
bulldog
clifford
turned
with
sudden
suspicion
upon
selby
the
latter
hummed
a
tune
selected
a
pair
of
gloves
and
choosing
a
dozen
cigarettes
placed
them
in
a
case
then
walking
over
to
the
cactus
he
deliberately
detached
a
blossom
drew
it
through
his
buttonhole
and
picking
up
hat
and
stick
smiled
upon
clifford
at
which
the
latter
was
mightily
troubled
iv
monday
morning
at
julian's
students
fought
for
places
students
with
prior
claims
drove
away
others
who
had
been
anxiously
squatting
on
coveted
tabourets
since
the
door
was
opened
in
hopes
of
appropriating
them
at
roll-call
students
squabbled
over
palettes
brushes
portfolios
or
rent
the
air
with
demands
for
ciceri
and
bread
the
former
a
dirty
ex-model
who
had
in
palmier
days
posed
as
judas
now
dispensed
stale
bread
at
one
sou
and
made
enough
to
keep
himself
in
cigarettes
monsieur
julian
walked
in
smiled
a
fatherly
smile
and
walked
out
his
disappearance
was
followed
by
the
apparition
of
the
clerk
a
foxy
creature
who
flitted
through
the
battling
hordes
in
search
of
prey
three
men
who
had
not
paid
dues
were
caught
and
summoned

outflanked
his
retreat
towards
the
door
cut
off
and
finally
captured
behind
the
stove
about
that
time
the
revolution
assuming
an
acute
form
howls
rose
for
jules
jules
came
umpired
two
fights
with
a
sad
resignation
in
his
big
brown
eyes
shook
hands
with
everybody
and
melted
away
in
the
throng
leaving
an
atmosphere
of
peace
and
good-will
the
lions
sat
down
with
the
lambs
the
massiers
marked
the
best
places
for
themselves
and
friends
and
mounting
the

a

a

a

and

and
the
voice
of
the

stern
and
reproachful
cochon
then
the
roll-call
was
resumed
clifford
the
massier
paused
and
looked
up
one
finger
between
the
leaves
of
the
ledger
clifford
clifford
was
not
there
he
was
about
three
miles
away
in
a
direct
line
and
every
instant
increased
the
distance
not
that
he
was
walking
fast--on
the
contrary
he
was
strolling
with
that
leisurely
gait
peculiar
to
himself
elliott
was
beside
him
and
two
bulldogs
covered
the
rear
elliott
was
reading
the
gil
blas
from
which
he
seemed
to
extract
amusement
but
deeming
boisterous
mirth
unsuitable
to
clifford's
state
of
mind
subdued
his
amusement
to
a
series
of
discreet
smiles
the
latter
moodily
aware
of
this
said
nothing
but
leading
the
way
into
the
luxembourg
gardens
installed
himself
upon
a
bench
by
the
northern
terrace
and
surveyed
the
landscape
with
disfavour
elliott
according
to
the
luxembourg
regulations
tied
the
two
dogs
and
then
with
an
interrogative
glance
toward
his
friend
resumed
the
gil
blas
and
the
discreet
smiles
the
day
was
perfect
the
sun
hung
over
notre
dame
setting
the
city
in
a
glitter
the
tender
foliage
of
the
chestnuts
cast
a
shadow
over
the
terrace
and
flecked
the
paths
and
walks
with
tracery
so
blue
that
clifford
might
here
have
found
encouragement
for
his
violent
impressions
had
he
but
looked
but
as
usual
in
this
period
of
his
career
his
thoughts
were
anywhere
except
in
his
profession
around
about
the
sparrows
quarrelled
and
chattered
their
courtship
songs
the
big
rosy
pigeons
sailed
from
tree
to
tree
the
flies
whirled
in
the
sunbeams
and
the
flowers
exhaled
a
thousand
perfumes
which
stirred
clifford
with
languorous
wistfulness
under
this
influence
he
spoke
elliott
you
are
a
true
friend--
you
make
me
ill
replied
the
latter
folding
his
paper
it's
just
as
i
thought--you
are
tagging
after
some
new
petticoat
again
and
he
continued
wrathfully
if
this
is
what
you've
kept
me
away
from
julian's
for--if
it's
to
fill
me
up
with
the
perfections
of
some
little
idiot--
not
idiot
remonstrated
clifford
gently
see
here
cried
elliott
have
you
the
nerve
to
try
to
tell
me
that
you
are
in
love
again
again
yes
again
and
again
and
again
and--by
george
have
you
this
observed
clifford
sadly
is
serious
for
a
moment
elliott
would
have
laid
hands
on
him
then
he
laughed
from
sheer
helplessness
oh
go
on
go
on
let's
see
there's
clã©mence
and
marie
tellec
and
cosette
and
fifine
colette
marie
verdier--
all
of
whom
are
charming
most
charming
but
i
never
was
serious--
so
help
me
moses
said
elliott
solemnly
each
and
every
one
of
those
named
have
separately
and
in
turn
torn
your
heart
with
anguish
and
have
also
made
me
lose
my
place
at
julian's
in
this
same
manner
each
and
every
one
separately
and
in
turn
do
you
deny
it
what
you
say
may
be
founded
on
facts--in
a
way--but
give
me
the
credit
of
being
faithful
to
one
at
a
time--
until
the
next
came
along
but
this--this
is
really
very
different
elliott
believe
me
i
am
all
broken
up
then
there
being
nothing
else
to
do
elliott
gnashed
his
teeth
and
listened
it's--it's
rue
barrã©e
well
observed
elliott
with
scorn
if
you
are
moping
and
moaning
over
that
girl--the
girl
who
has
given
you
and
myself
every
reason
to
wish
that
the
ground
would
open
and
engulf
us--well
go
on
i'm
going
on--i
don't
care
timidity
has
fled--
yes
your
native
timidity
i'm
desperate
elliott
am
i
in
love
never
never
did
i
feel
so
d--n
miserable
i
can't
sleep
honestly
i'm
incapable
of
eating
properly
same
symptoms
noticed
in
the
case
of
colette
listen
will
you
hold
on
a
moment
i
know
the
rest
by
heart
now
let
me
ask
you
something
is
it
your
belief
that
rue
barrã©e
is
a
pure
girl
yes
said
clifford
turning
red
do
you
love
her--not
as
you
dangle
and
tiptoe
after
every
pretty
inanity--i
mean
do
you
honestly
love
her
yes
said
the
other
doggedly
i
would--
hold
on
a
moment
would
you
marry
her
clifford
turned
scarlet
yes
he
muttered
pleasant
news
for
your
family
growled
elliott
in
suppressed
fury
'dear
father
i
have
just
married
a
charming
grisette
whom
i'm
sure
you'll
welcome
with
open
arms
in
company
with
her
mother
a
most
estimable
and
cleanly
washlady'
good
heavens
this
seems
to
have
gone
a
little
further
than
the
rest
thank
your
stars
young
man
that
my
head
is
level
enough
for
us
both
still
in
this
case
i
have
no
fear
rue
barrã©e
sat
on
your
aspirations
in
a
manner
unmistakably
final
rue
barrã©e
began
clifford
drawing
himself
up
but
he
suddenly
ceased
for
there
where
the
dappled
sunlight
glowed
in
spots
of
gold
along
the
sun-flecked
path
tripped
rue
barrã©e
her
gown
was
spotless
and
her
big
straw
hat
tipped
a
little
from
the
white
forehead
threw
a
shadow
across
her
eyes
elliott
stood
up
and
bowed
clifford
removed
his
head-covering
with
an
air
so
plaintive
so
appealing
so
utterly
humble
that
rue
barrã©e
smiled
the
smile
was
delicious
and
when
clifford
incapable
of
sustaining
himself
on
his
legs
from
sheer
astonishment
toppled
slightly
she
smiled
again
in
spite
of
herself
a
few
moments
later
she
took
a
chair
on
the
terrace
and
drawing
a
book
from
her
music-roll
turned
the
pages
found
the
place
and
then
placing
it
open
downwards
in
her
lap
sighed
a
little
smiled
a
little
and
looked
out
over
the
city
she
had
entirely
forgotten

after
a
while
she
took
up
her
book
again
but
instead
of
reading
began
to
adjust
a
rose
in
her
corsage
the
rose
was
big
and
red
it
glowed
like
fire
there
over
her
heart
and
like
fire
it
warmed
her
heart
now
fluttering
under
the
silken
petals
rue
barrã©e
sighed
again
she
was
very
happy
the
sky
was
so
blue
the
air
so
soft
and
perfumed
the
sunshine
so
caressing
and
her
heart
sang
within
her
sang
to
the
rose
in
her
breast
this
is
what
it
sang
out
of
the
throng
of
passers-by
out
of
the
world
of
yesterday
out
of
the
millions
passing
one
has
turned
aside
to
me
so
her
heart
sang
under
his
rose
on
her
breast
then
two
big
mouse-coloured
pigeons
came
whistling
by
and
alighted
on
the
terrace
where
they
bowed
and
strutted
and
bobbed
and
turned
until
rue
barrã©e
laughed
in
delight
and
looking
up
beheld
clifford
before
her
his
hat
was
in
his
hand
and
his
face
was
wreathed
in
a
series
of
appealing
smiles
which
would
have
touched
the
heart
of
a
bengal
tiger
for
an
instant
rue
barrã©e
frowned
then
she
looked
curiously
at
clifford
then
when
she
saw
the
resemblance
between
his
bows
and
the
bobbing
pigeons
in
spite
of
herself
her
lips
parted
in
the
most
bewitching
laugh
was
this
rue
barrã©e
so
changed
so
changed
that
she
did
not
know
herself
but
oh
that
song
in
her
heart
which
drowned
all
else
which
trembled
on
her
lips
struggling
for
utterance
which
rippled
forth
in
a
laugh
at
nothing--at
a
strutting
pigeon--and
mr
clifford
and
you
think
because
i
return
the
salute
of
the
students
in
the
quarter
that
you
may
be
received
in
particular
as
a
friend
i
do
not
know
you
monsieur
but
vanity
is
man's
other
name--be
content
monsieur
vanity
i
shall
be
punctilious--oh
most
punctilious
in
returning
your
salute
but
i
beg--i
implore
you
to
let
me
render
you
that
homage
which
has
so
long--
oh
dear
i
don't
care
for
homage
let
me
only
be
permitted
to
speak
to
you
now
and
then--occasionally--very
occasionally
and
if
you
why
not
another
not
at
all--i
will
be
discretion
itself
discretion--why
her
eyes
were
very
clear
and
clifford
winced
for
a
moment
but
only
for
a
moment
then
the
devil
of
recklessness
seizing
him
he
sat
down
and
offered
himself
soul
and
body
goods
and
chattels
and
all
the
time
he
knew
he
was
a
fool
and
that
infatuation
is
not
love
and
that
each
word
he
uttered
bound
him
in
honour
from
which
there
was
no
escape
and
all
the
time
elliott
was
scowling
down
on
the
fountain
plaza
and
savagely
checking
both
bulldogs
from
their
desire
to
rush
to
clifford's
rescue--for
even
they
felt
there
was
something
wrong
as
elliott
stormed
within
himself
and
growled
maledictions
when
clifford
finished
he
finished
in
a
glow
of
excitement
but
rue
barrã©e's
response
was
long
in
coming
and
his
ardour
cooled
while
the
situation
slowly
assumed
its
just
proportions
then
regret
began
to
creep
in
but
he
put
that
aside
and
broke
out
again
in
protestations
at
the
first
word
rue
barrã©e
checked
him
i
thank
you
she
said
speaking
very
gravely
no
man
has
ever
before
offered
me
marriage
she
turned
and
looked
out
over
the
city
after
a
while
she
spoke
again
you
offer
me
a
great
deal
i
am
alone
i
have
nothing
i
am
nothing
she
turned
again
and
looked
at
paris
brilliant
fair
in
the
sunshine
of
a
perfect
day
he
followed
her
eyes
oh
she
murmured
it
is
hard--hard
to
work
always--always
alone
with
never
a
friend
you
can
have
in
honour
and
the
love
that
is
offered
means
the
streets
the
boulevard--when
passion
is
dead
i
know
it--we
know
it--we
others
who
have
nothing--have
no
one
and
who
give
ourselves
unquestioning--when
we
love--yes
unquestioning--heart
and
soul
knowing
the
end
she
touched
the
rose
at
her
breast
for
a
moment
she
seemed
to
forget
him
then
quietly--i
thank
you
i
am
very
grateful
she
opened
the
book
and
plucking
a
petal
from
the
rose
dropped
it
between
the
leaves
then
looking
up
she
said
gently
i
cannot
accept
v
it
took
clifford
a
month
to
entirely
recover
although
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
he
was
pronounced
convalescent
by
elliott
who
was
an
authority
and
his
convalescence
was
aided
by
the
cordiality
with
which
rue
barrã©e
acknowledged
his
solemn
salutes
forty
times
a
day
he
blessed
rue
barrã©e
for
her
refusal
and
thanked
his
lucky
stars
and
at
the
same
time
oh
wondrous
heart
of
ours--he
suffered
the
tortures
of
the
blighted
elliott
was
annoyed
partly
by
clifford's
reticence
partly
by
the
unexplainable
thaw
in
the
frigidity
of
rue
barrã©e
at
their
frequent
encounters
when
she
tripping
along
the
rue
de
seine
with
music-roll
and
big
straw
hat
would
pass
clifford
and
his
familiars
steering
an
easterly
course
to
the
cafã©
vachette
and
at
the
respectful
uncovering
of
the
band
would
colour
and
smile
at
clifford
elliott's
slumbering
suspicions
awoke
but
he
never
found
out
anything
and
finally
gave
it
up
as
beyond
his
comprehension
merely
qualifying
clifford
as
an
idiot
and
reserving
his
opinion
of
rue
barrã©e
and
all
this
time
selby
was
jealous
at
first
he
refused
to
acknowledge
it
to
himself
and
cut
the
studio
for
a
day
in
the
country
but
the
woods
and
fields
of
course
aggravated
his
case
and
the
brooks
babbled
of
rue
barrã©e
and
the
mowers
calling
to
each
other
across
the
meadow
ended
in
a
quavering
rue
bar-rã©e-e
that
day
spent
in
the
country
made
him
angry
for
a
week
and
he
worked
sulkily
at
julian's
all
the
time
tormented
by
a
desire
to
know
where
clifford
was
and
what
he
might
be
doing
this
culminated
in
an
erratic
stroll
on
sunday
which
ended
at
the
flower-market
on
the
pont
au
change
began
again
was
gloomily
extended
to
the
morgue
and
again
ended
at
the
marble
bridge
it
would
never
do
and
selby
felt
it
so
he
went
to
see
clifford
who
was
convalescing
on
mint
juleps
in
his
garden
they
sat
down
together
and
discussed
morals
and
human
happiness
and
each
found
the
other
most
entertaining
only
selby
failed
to
pump
clifford
to
the
other's
unfeigned
amusement
but
the
juleps
spread
balm
on
the
sting
of
jealousy
and
trickled
hope
to
the
blighted
and
when
selby
said
he
must
go
clifford
went
too
and
when
selby
not
to
be
outdone
insisted
on
accompanying
clifford
back
to
his
door
clifford
determined
to
see
selby
back
half
way
and
then
finding
it
hard
to
part
they
decided
to
dine
together
and
flit
to
flit
a
verb
applied
to
clifford's
nocturnal
prowls
expressed
perhaps
as
well
as
anything
the
gaiety
proposed
dinner
was
ordered
at
mignon's
and
while
selby
interviewed
the
chef
clifford
kept
a
fatherly
eye
on
the
butler
the
dinner
was
a
success
or
was
of
the
sort
generally
termed
a
success
toward
the
dessert
selby
heard
some
one
say
as
at
a
great
distance
kid
selby
drunk
as
a
lord
a
group
of
men
passed
near
them
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
shook
hands
and
laughed
a
great
deal
and
that
everybody
was
very
witty
there
was
clifford
opposite
swearing
undying
confidence
in
his
chum
selby
and
there
seemed
to
be
others
there
either
seated
beside
them
or
continually
passing
with
the
swish
of
skirts
on
the
polished
floor
the
perfume
of
roses
the
rustle
of
fans
the
touch
of
rounded
arms
and
the
laughter
grew
vaguer
and
vaguer
the
room
seemed
enveloped
in
mist
then
all
in
a
moment
each
object
stood
out
painfully
distinct
only
forms
and
visages
were
distorted
and
voices
piercing
he
drew
himself
up
calm
grave
for
the
moment
master
of
himself
but
very
drunk
he
knew
he
was
drunk
and
was
as
guarded
and
alert
as
keenly
suspicious
of
himself
as
he
would
have
been
of
a
thief
at
his
elbow
his
self-command
enabled
clifford
to
hold
his
head
safely
under
some
running
water
and
repair
to
the
street
considerably
the
worse
for
wear
but
never
suspecting
that
his
companion
was
drunk
for
a
time
he
kept
his
self-command
his
face
was
only
a
bit
paler
a
bit
tighter
than
usual
he
was
only
a
trifle
slower
and
more
fastidious
in
his
speech
it
was
midnight
when
he
left
clifford
peacefully
slumbering
in
somebody's
arm-chair
with
a
long
suede
glove
dangling
in
his
hand
and
a
plumy
boa
twisted
about
his
neck
to
protect
his
throat
from
drafts
he
walked
through
the
hall
and
down
the
stairs
and
found
himself
on
the
sidewalk
in
a
quarter
he
did
not
know
mechanically
he
looked
up
at
the
name
of
the
street
the
name
was
not
familiar
he
turned
and
steered
his
course
toward
some
lights
clustered
at
the
end
of
the
street
they
proved
farther
away
than
he
had
anticipated
and
after
a
long
quest
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
his
eyes
had
been
mysteriously
removed
from
their
proper
places
and
had
been
reset
on
either
side
of
his
head
like
those
of
a
bird
it
grieved
him
to
think
of
the
inconvenience
this
transformation
might
occasion
him
and
he
attempted
to
cock
up
his
head
hen-like
to
test
the
mobility
of
his
neck
then
an
immense
despair
stole
over
him--tears
gathered
in
the
tear-ducts
his
heart
melted
and
he
collided
with
a
tree
this
shocked
him
into
comprehension
he
stifled
the
violent
tenderness
in
his
breast
picked
up
his
hat
and
moved
on
more
briskly
his
mouth
was
white
and
drawn
his
teeth
tightly
clinched
he
held
his
course
pretty
well
and
strayed
but
little
and
after
an
apparently
interminable
length
of
time
found
himself
passing
a
line
of
cabs
the
brilliant
lamps
red
yellow
and
green
annoyed
him
and
he
felt
it
might
be
pleasant
to
demolish
them
with
his
cane
but
mastering
this
impulse
he
passed
on
later
an
idea
struck
him
that
it
would
save
fatigue
to
take
a
cab
and
he
started
back
with
that
intention
but
the
cabs
seemed
already
so
far
away
and
the
lanterns
were
so
bright
and
confusing
that
he
gave
it
up
and
pulling
himself
together
looked
around
a
shadow
a
mass
huge
undefined
rose
to
his
right
he
recognized
the
arc
de
triomphe
and
gravely
shook
his
cane
at
it
its
size
annoyed
him
he
felt
it
was
too
big
then
he
heard
something
fall
clattering
to
the
pavement
and
thought
probably
it
was
his
cane
but
it
didn't
much
matter
when
he
had
mastered
himself
and
regained
control
of
his
right
leg
which
betrayed
symptoms
of
insubordination
he
found
himself
traversing
the
place
de
la
concorde
at
a
pace
which
threatened
to
land
him
at
the
madeleine
this
would
never
do
he
turned
sharply
to
the
right
and
crossing
the
bridge
passed
the
palais
bourbon
at
a
trot
and
wheeled
into
the
boulevard
st
germain
he
got
on
well
enough
although
the
size
of
the
war
office
struck
him
as
a
personal
insult
and
he
missed
his
cane
which
it
would
have
been
pleasant
to
drag
along
the
iron
railings
as
he
passed
it
occurred
to
him
however
to
substitute
his
hat
but
when
he
found
it
he
forgot
what
he
wanted
it
for
and
replaced
it
upon
his
head
with
gravity
then
he
was
obliged
to
battle
with
a
violent
inclination
to
sit
down
and
weep
this
lasted
until
he
came
to
the
rue
de
rennes
but
there
he
became
absorbed
in
contemplating
the
dragon
on
the
balcony
overhanging
the
cour
du
dragon
and
time
slipped
away
until
he
remembered
vaguely
that
he
had
no
business
there
and
marched
off
again
it
was
slow
work
the
inclination
to
sit
down
and
weep
had
given
place
to
a
desire
for
solitary
and
deep
reflection
here
his
right
leg
forgot
its
obedience
and
attacking
the
left
outflanked
it
and
brought
him
up
against
a
wooden
board
which
seemed
to
bar
his
path
he
tried
to
walk
around
it
but
found
the
street
closed
he
tried
to
push
it
over
and
found
he
couldn't
then
he
noticed
a
red
lantern
standing
on
a
pile
of
paving-stones
inside
the
barrier
this
was
pleasant
how
was
he
to
get
home
if
the
boulevard
was
blocked
but
he
was
not
on
the
boulevard
his
treacherous
right
leg
had
beguiled
him
into
a
detour
for
there
behind
him
lay
the
boulevard
with
its
endless
line
of
lamps--and
here
what
was
this
narrow
dilapidated
street
piled
up
with
earth
and
mortar
and
heaps
of
stone
he
looked
up
written
in
staring
black
letters
on
the
barrier
was
rue
barrãe
he
sat
down
two
policemen
whom
he
knew
came
by
and
advised
him
to
get
up
but
he
argued
the
question
from
a
standpoint
of
personal
taste
and
they
passed
on
laughing
for
he
was
at
that
moment
absorbed
in
a
problem
it
was
how
to
see
rue
barrã©e
she
was
somewhere
or
other
in
that
big
house
with
the
iron
balconies
and
the
door
was
locked
but
what
of
that
the
simple
idea
struck
him
to
shout
until
she
came
this
idea
was
replaced
by
another
equally
lucid--to
hammer
on
the
door
until
she
came
but
finally
rejecting
both
of
these
as
too
uncertain
he
decided
to
climb
into
the
balcony
and
opening
a
window
politely
inquire
for
rue
barrã©e
there
was
but
one
lighted
window
in
the
house
that
he
could
see
it
was
on
the
second
floor
and
toward
this
he
cast
his
eyes
then
mounting
the
wooden
barrier
and
clambering
over
the
piles
of
stones
he
reached
the
sidewalk
and
looked
up
at
the
faã§ade
for
a
foothold
it
seemed
impossible
but
a
sudden
fury
seized
him
a
blind
drunken
obstinacy
and
the
blood
rushed
to
his
head
leaping
beating
in
his
ears
like
the
dull
thunder
of
an
ocean
he
set
his
teeth
and
springing
at
a
window-sill
dragged
himself
up
and
hung
to
the
iron
bars
then
reason
fled
there
surged
in
his
brain
the
sound
of
many
voices
his
heart
leaped
up
beating
a
mad
tattoo
and
gripping
at
cornice
and
ledge
he
worked
his
way
along
the
faã§ade
clung
to
pipes
and
shutters
and
dragged
himself
up
over
and
into
the
balcony
by
the
lighted
window
his
hat
fell
off
and
rolled
against
the
pane
for
a
moment
he
leaned
breathless
against
the
railing--then
the
window
was
slowly
opened
from
within
they
stared
at
each
other
for
some
time
presently
the
girl
took
two
unsteady
steps
back
into
the
room
he
saw
her
face--all
crimsoned
now--he
saw
her
sink
into
a
chair
by
the
lamplit
table
and
without
a
word
he
followed
her
into
the
room
closing
the
big
door-like
panes
behind
him
then
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
the
room
was
small
and
white
everything
was
white
about
it--the
curtained
bed
the
little
wash-stand
in
the
corner
the
bare
walls
the
china
lamp--and
his
own
face--had
he
known
it
but
the
face
and
neck
of
rue
were
surging
in
the
colour
that
dyed
the
blossoming
rose-tree
there
on
the
hearth
beside
her
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
speak
she
seemed
not
to
expect
it
his
mind
was
struggling
with
the
impressions
of
the
room
the
whiteness
the
extreme
purity
of
everything
occupied
him--began
to
trouble
him
as
his
eye
became
accustomed
to
the
light
other
objects
grew
from
the
surroundings
and
took
their
places
in
the
circle
of
lamplight
there
was
a
piano
and
a
coal-scuttle
and
a
little
iron
trunk
and
a
bath-tub
then
there
was
a
row
of
wooden
pegs
against
the
door
with
a
white
chintz
curtain
covering
the
clothes
underneath
on
the
bed
lay
an
umbrella
and
a
big
straw
hat
and
on
the
table
a
music-roll
unfurled
an
ink-stand
and
sheets
of
ruled
paper
behind
him
stood
a
wardrobe
faced
with
a
mirror
but
somehow
he
did
not
care
to
see
his
own
face
just
then
he
was
sobering
the
girl
sat
looking
at
him
without
a
word
her
face
was
expressionless
yet
the
lips
at
times
trembled
almost
imperceptibly
her
eyes
so
wonderfully
blue
in
the
daylight
seemed
dark
and
soft
as
velvet
and
the
colour
on
her
neck
deepened
and
whitened
with
every
breath
she
seemed
smaller
and
more
slender
than
when
he
had
seen
her
in
the
street
and
there
was
now
something
in
the
curve
of
her
cheek
almost
infantine
when
at
last
he
turned
and
caught
his
own
reflection
in
the
mirror
behind
him
a
shock
passed
through
him
as
though
he
had
seen
a
shameful
thing
and
his
clouded
mind
and
his
clouded
thoughts
grew
clearer
for
a
moment
their
eyes
met
then
his
sought
the
floor
his
lips
tightened
and
the
struggle
within
him
bowed
his
head
and
strained
every
nerve
to
the
breaking
and
now
it
was
over
for
the
voice
within
had
spoken
he
listened
dully
interested
but
already
knowing
the
end--indeed
it
little
mattered--the
end
would
always
be
the
same
for
him--he
understood
now--always
the
same
for
him
and
he
listened
dully
interested
to
a
voice
which
grew
within
him
after
a
while
he
stood
up
and
she
rose
at
once
one
small
hand
resting
on
the
table
presently
he
opened
the
window
picked
up
his
hat
and
shut
it
again
then
he
went
over
to
the
rosebush
and
touched
the
blossoms
with
his
face
one
was
standing
in
a
glass
of
water
on
the
table
and
mechanically
the
girl
drew
it
out
pressed
it
with
her
lips
and
laid
it
on
the
table
beside
him
he
took
it
without
a
word
and
crossing
the
room
opened
the
door
the
landing
was
dark
and
silent
but
the
girl
lifted
the
lamp
and
gliding
past
him
slipped
down
the
polished
stairs
to
the
hallway
then
unchaining
the
bolts
she
drew
open
the
iron
wicket
through
this
he
passed
with
his
rose
