from
even
the
greatest
of
horrors
irony
is
seldom
absent
sometimes
it
enters
directly
into
the
composition
of
the
events
while
sometimes
it
relates
only
to
their
fortuitous
position
among
persons
and
places
the
latter
sort
is
splendidly
exemplified
by
a
case
in
the
ancient
city
of
providence
where
in
the
late
forties
edgar
allan
poe
used
to
sojourn
often
during
his
unsuccessful
wooing
of
the
gifted
poetess
mrs
whitman
poe
generally
stopped
at
the
mansion
house
in
benefit
street--the
renamed
golden
ball
inn
whose
roof
has
sheltered
washington
jefferson
and
lafayette--and
his
favorite
walk
led
northward
along
the
same
street
to
mrs
whitman's
home
and
the
neighboring
hillside
churchyard
of
st
john's
whose
hidden
expanse
of
eighteenth
century
gravestones
had
for
him
a
peculiar
fascination
now
the
irony
is
this
in
this
walk
so
many
times
repeated
the
world's
greatest
master
of
the
terrible
and
the
bizarre
was
obliged
to
pass
a
particular
house
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
street
a
dingy
antiquated
structure
perched
on
the
abruptly
rising
side
hill
with
a
great
unkempt
yard
dating
from
a
time
when
the
region
was
partly
open
country
it
does
not
appear
that
he
ever
wrote
or
spoke
of
it
nor
is
there
any
evidence
that
he
even
noticed
it
and
yet
that
house
to
the
two
persons
in
possession
of
certain
information
equals
or
outranks
in
horror
the
wildest
fantasy
of
the
genius
who
so
often
passed
it
unknowingly
and
stands
starkly
leering
as
a
symbol
of
all
that
is
unutterably
hideous
the
house
was--and
for
that
matter
still
is--of
a
kind
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
curious
originally
a
farm
or
semi-farm
building
it
followed
the
average
new
england
colonial
lines
of
the
middle
eighteenth
century--the
prosperous
peaked-roof
sort
with
two
stories
and
dormerless
attic
and
with
the
georgian
doorway
and
interior
panelling
dictated
by
the
progress
of
taste
at
that
time
it
faced
south
with
one
gable
end
buried
to
the
lower
windows
in
the
eastward
rising
hill
and
the
other
exposed
to
the
foundations
toward
the
street
its
construction
over
a
century
and
a
half
ago
had
followed
the
grading
and
straightening
of
the
road
in
that
especial
vicinity
for
benefit
street--at
first
called
back
street--was
laid
out
as
a
lane
winding
amongst
the
graveyards
of
the
first
settlers
and
straightened
only
when
the
removal
of
the
bodies
to
the
north
burial
ground
made
it
decently
possible
to
cut
through
the
old
family
plots
at
the
start
the
western
wall
had
lain
some
twenty
feet
up
a
precipitous
lawn
from
the
roadway
but
a
widening
of
the
street
at
about
the
time
of
the
revolution
sheared
off
most
of
the
intervening
space
exposing
the
foundations
so
that
a
brick
basement
wall
had
to
be
made
giving
the
deep
cellar
a
street
frontage
with
door
and
one
window
above
ground
close
to
the
new
line
of
public
travel
when
the
sidewalk
was
laid
out
a
century
ago
the
last
of
the
intervening
space
was
removed
and
poe
in
his
walks
must
have
seen
only
a
sheer
ascent
of
dull
gray
brick
flush
with
the
sidewalk
and
surmounted
at
a
height
of
ten
feet
by
the
antique
shingled
bulk
of
the
house
proper
illustration
that
awful
door
in
benefit
street
which
i
had
left
ajar
the
farm-like
ground
extended
back
very
deeply
up
the
hill
almost
to
wheaton
street
the
space
south
of
the
house
abutting
on
benefit
street
was
of
course
greatly
above
the
existing
sidewalk
level
forming
a
terrace
bounded
by
a
high
bank
wall
of
damp
mossy
stone
pierced
by
a
steep
flight
of
narrow
steps
which
led
inward
between
canyon-like
surfaces
to
the
upper
region
of
mangy
lawn
rheumy
brick
walks
and
neglected
gardens
whose
dismantled
cement
urns
rusted
kettles
fallen
from
tripods
of
knotty
sticks
and
similar
paraphernalia
set
off
the
weather-beaten
front
door
with
its
broken
fanlight
rotting
ionic
pilasters
and
wormy
triangular
pediment





what
i
heard
in
my
youth
about
the
shunned
house
was
merely
that
people
died
there
in
alarmingly
great
numbers
that
i
was
told
was
why
the
original
owners
had
moved
out
some
twenty
years
after
building
the
place
it
was
plainly
unhealthy
perhaps
because
of
the
dampness
and
fungous
growths
in
the
cellar
the
general
sickish
smell
the
drafts
of
the
hallways
or
the
quality
of
the
well
and
pump
water
these
things
were
bad
enough
and
these
were
all
that
gained
belief
among
the
persons
whom
i
knew
only
the
notebooks
of
my
antiquarian
uncle
doctor
elihu
whipple
revealed
to
me
at
length
the
darker
vaguer
surmises
which
formed
an
undercurrent
of
folklore
among
old-time
servants
and
humble
folk
surmises
which
never
travelled
far
and
which
were
largely
forgotten
when
providence
grew
to
be
a
metropolis
with
a
shifting
modern
population
the
general
fact
is
that
the
house
was
never
regarded
by
the
solid
part
of
the
community
as
in
any
real
sense
haunted
there
were
no
widespread
tales
of
rattling
chains
cold
currents
of
air
extinguished
lights
or
faces
at
the
window
extremists
sometimes
said
the
house
was
unlucky
but
that
is
as
far
as
even
they
went
what
was
really
beyond
dispute
is
that
a
frightful
proportion
of
persons
died
there
or
more
accurately
had
died
there
since
after
some
peculiar
happenings
over
sixty
years
ago
the
building
had
become
deserted
through
the
sheer
impossibility
of
renting
it
these
persons
were
not
all
cut
off
suddenly
by
any
one
cause
rather
did
it
seem
that
their
vitality
was
insidiously
sapped
so
that
each
one
died
the
sooner
from
whatever
tendency
to
weakness
he
may
have
naturally
had
and
those
who
did
not
die
displayed
in
varying
degree
a
type
of
anemia
or
consumption
and
sometimes
a
decline
of
the
mental
faculties
which
spoke
ill
for
the
salubriousness
of
the
building
neighboring
houses
it
must
be
added
seemed
entirely
free
from
the
noxious
quality
this
much
i
knew
before
my
insistent
questioning
led
my
uncle
to
show
me
the
notes
which
finally
embarked
us
both
on
our
hideous
investigation
in
my
childhood
the
shunned
house
was
vacant
with
barren
gnarled
and
terrible
old
trees
long
queerly
pale
grass
and
nightmarishly
misshapen
weeds
in
the
high
terraced
yard
where
birds
never
lingered
we
boys
used
to
overrun
the
place
and
i
can
still
recall
my
youthful
terror
not
only
at
the
morbid
strangeness
of
this
sinister
vegetation
but
at
the
eldritch
atmosphere
and
odor
of
the
dilapidated
house
whose
unlocked
front
door
was
often
entered
in
quest
of
shudders
the
small-paned
windows
were
largely
broken
and
a
nameless
air
of
desolation
hung
round
the
precarious
panelling
shaky
interior
shutters
peeling
wall-paper
falling
plaster
rickety
staircases
and
such
fragments
of
battered
furniture
as
still
remained
the
dust
and
cobwebs
added
their
touch
of
the
fearful
and
brave
indeed
was
the
boy
who
would
voluntarily
ascend
the
ladder
to
the
attic
a
vast
raftered
length
lighted
only
by
small
blinking
windows
in
the
gable
ends
and
filled
with
a
massed
wreckage
of
chests
chairs
and
spinning-wheels
which
infinite
years
of
deposit
had
shrouded
and
festooned
into
monstrous
and
hellish
shapes
but
after
all
the
attic
was
not
the
most
terrible
part
of
the
house
it
was
the
dank
humid
cellar
which
somehow
exerted
the
strongest
repulsion
on
us
even
though
it
was
wholly
above
ground
on
the
street
side
with
only
a
thin
door
and
window-pierced
brick
wall
to
separate
it
from
the
busy
sidewalk
we
scarcely
knew
whether
to
haunt
it
in
spectral
fascination
or
to
shun
it
for
the
sake
of
our
souls
and
our
sanity
for
one
thing
the
bad
odor
of
the
house
was
strongest
there
and
for
another
thing
we
did
not
like
the
white
fungous
growths
which
occasionally
sprang
up
in
rainy
summer
weather
from
the
hard
earth
floor
those
fungi
grotesquely
like
the
vegetation
in
the
yard
outside
were
truly
horrible
in
their
outlines
detestable
parodies
of
toadstools
and
indian-pipes
whose
like
we
had
never
seen
in
any
other
situation
they
rotted
quickly
and
at
one
stage
became
slightly
phosphorescent
so
that
nocturnal
passers-by
sometimes
spoke
of
witch-fires
glowing
behind
the
broken
panes
of
the
fetor-spreading
windows
we
never--even
in
our
wildest
halloween
moods--visited
this
cellar
by
night
but
in
some
of
our
daytime
visits
could
detect
the
phosphorescence
especially
when
the
day
was
dark
and
wet
there
was
also
a
subtler
thing
we
often
thought
we
detected--a
very
strange
thing
which
was
however
merely
suggestive
at
most
i
refer
to
a
sort
of
cloudy
whitish
pattern
on
the
dirt
floor--a
vague
shifting
deposit
of
mold
or
niter
which
we
sometimes
thought
we
could
trace
amidst
the
sparse
fungous
growths
near
the
huge
fireplace
of
the
basement
kitchen
once
in
a
while
it
struck
us
that
this
patch
bore
an
uncanny
resemblance
to
a
doubled-up
human
figure
though
generally
no
such
kinship
existed
and
often
there
was
no
whitish
deposit
whatever
on
a
certain
rainy
afternoon
when
this
illusion
seemed
phenomenally
strong
and
when
in
addition
i
had
fancied
i
glimpsed
a
kind
of
thin
yellowish
shimmering
exhalation
rising
from
the
nitrous
pattern
toward
the
yawning
fireplace
i
spoke
to
my
uncle
about
the
matter
he
smiled
at
this
odd
conceit
but
it
seemed
that
his
smile
was
tinged
with
reminiscence
later
i
heard
that
a
similar
notion
entered
into
some
of
the
wild
ancient
tales
of
the
common
folk--a
notion
likewise
alluding
to
ghoulish
wolfish
shapes
taken
by
smoke
from
the
great
chimney
and
queer
contours
assumed
by
certain
of
the
sinuous
tree-roots
that
thrust
their
way
into
the
cellar
through
the
loose
foundation-stones
2
not
till
my
adult
years
did
my
uncle
set
before
me
the
notes
and
data
which
he
had
collected
concerning
the
shunned
house
doctor
whipple
was
a
sane
conservative
physician
of
the
old
school
and
for
all
his
interest
in
the
place
was
not
eager
to
encourage
young
thoughts
toward
the
abnormal
his
own
view
postulating
simply
a
building
and
location
of
markedly
unsanitary
qualities
had
nothing
to
do
with
abnormality
but
he
realized
that
the
very
picturesqueness
which
aroused
his
own
interest
would
in
a
boy's
fanciful
mind
take
on
all
manner
of
gruesome
imaginative
associations
the
doctor
was
a
bachelor
a
white-haired
clean-shaven
old-fashioned
gentleman
and
a
local
historian
of
note
who
had
often
broken
a
lance
with
such
controversial
guardians
of
tradition
as
sidney
s
rider
and
thomas
w
bicknell
he
lived
with
one
man-servant
in
a
georgian
homestead
with
knocker
and
iron-railed
steps
balanced
eerily
on
the
steep
ascent
of
north
court
street
beside
the
ancient
brick
court
and
colony
house
where
his
grandfather--a
cousin
of
that
celebrated
privateersman
captain
whipple
who
burnt
his
majesty's
armed
schooner
gaspee
in
1772--had
voted
in
the
legislature
on
may
4
1776
for
the
independence
of
the
rhode
island
colony
around
him
in
the
damp
low-ceiled
library
with
the
musty
white
panelling
heavy
carved
overmantel
and
small-paned
vine-shaded
windows
were
the
relics
and
records
of
his
ancient
family
among
which
were
many
dubious
allusions
to
the
shunned
house
in
benefit
street
that
pest
spot
lies
not
far
distant--for
benefit
runs
ledgewise
just
above
the
court
house
along
the
precipitous
hill
up
which
the
first
settlement
climbed
when
in
the
end
my
insistent
pestering
and
maturing
years
evoked
from
my
uncle
the
hoarded
lore
i
sought
there
lay
before
me
a
strange
enough
chronicle
long-winded
statistical
and
drearily
genealogical
as
some
of
the
matter
was
there
ran
through
it
a
continuous
thread
of
brooding
tenacious
horror
and
preternatural
malevolence
which
impressed
me
even
more
than
it
had
impressed
the
good
doctor
separate
events
fitted
together
uncannily
and
seemingly
irrelevant
details
held
mines
of
hideous
possibilities
a
new
and
burning
curiosity
grew
in
me
compared
to
which
my
boyish
curiosity
was
feeble
and
inchoate
the
first
revelation
led
to
an
exhaustive
research
and
finally
to
that
shuddering
quest
which
proved
so
disastrous
to
myself
and
mine
for
at
the
last
my
uncle
insisted
on
joining
the
search
i
had
commenced
and
after
a
certain
night
in
that
house
he
did
not
come
away
with
me
i
am
lonely
without
that
gentle
soul
whose
long
years
were
filled
only
with
honor
virtue
good
taste
benevolence
and
learning
i
have
reared
a
marble
urn
to
his
memory
in
st
john's
churchyard--the
place
that
poe
loved--the
hidden
grove
of
giant
willows
on
the
hill
where
tombs
and
headstones
huddle
quietly
between
the
hoary
bulk
of
the
church
and
the
houses
and
bank
walls
of
benefit
street
the
history
of
the
house
opening
amidst
a
maze
of
dates
revealed
no
trace
of
the
sinister
either
about
its
construction
or
about
the
prosperous
and
honorable
family
who
built
it
yet
from
the
first
a
taint
of
calamity
soon
increased
to
boding
significance
was
apparent
my
uncle's
carefully
compiled
record
began
with
the
building
of
the
structure
in
1763
and
followed
the
theme
with
an
unusual
amount
of
detail
the
shunned
house
it
seems
was
first
inhabited
by
william
harris
and
his
wife
rhoby
dexter
with
their
children
elkanah
born
in
1755
abigail
born
in
1757
william
jr
born
in
1759
and
ruth
born
in
1761
harris
was
a
substantial
merchant
and
seaman
in
the
west
india
trade
connected
with
the
firm
of
obadiah
brown
and
his
nephews
after
brown's
death
in
1761
the
new
firm
of
nicholas
brown

company
made
him
master
of
the
brig
prudence
providence-built
of
120
tons
thus
enabling
him
to
erect
the
new
homestead
he
had
desired
ever
since
his
marriage
the
site
he
had
chosen--a
recently
straightened
part
of
the
new
and
fashionable
back
street
which
ran
along
the
side
of
the
hill
above
crowded
cheapside--was
all
that
could
be
wished
and
the
building
did
justice
to
the
location
it
was
the
best
that
moderate
means
could
afford
and
harris
hastened
to
move
in
before
the
birth
of
a
fifth
child
which
the
family
expected
that
child
a
boy
came
in
december
but
was
still-born
nor
was
any
child
to
be
born
alive
in
that
house
for
a
century
and
a
half
the
next
april
sickness
occurred
among
the
children
and
abigail
and
ruth
died
before
the
month
was
over
doctor
job
ives
diagnosed
the
trouble
as
some
infantile
fever
though
others
declared
it
was
more
of
a
mere
wasting-away
or
decline
it
seemed
in
any
event
to
be
contagious
for
hannah
bowen
one
of
the
two
servants
died
of
it
in
the
following
june
eli
lideason
the
other
servant
constantly
complained
of
weakness
and
would
have
returned
to
his
father's
farm
in
rehoboth
but
for
a
sudden
attachment
for
mehitabel
pierce
who
was
hired
to
succeed
hannah
he
died
the
next
year--a
sad
year
indeed
since
it
marked
the
death
of
william
harris
himself
enfeebled
as
he
was
by
the
climate
of
martinique
where
his
occupation
had
kept
him
for
considerable
periods
during
the
preceding
decade
the
widowed
rhoby
harris
never
recovered
from
the
shock
of
her
husband's
death
and
the
passing
of
her
first-born
elkanah
two
years
later
was
the
final
blow
to
her
reason
in
1768
she
fell
victim
to
a
mild
form
of
insanity
and
was
thereafter
confined
to
the
upper
part
of
the
house
her
elder
maiden
sister
mercy
dexter
having
moved
in
to
take
charge
of
the
family
mercy
was
a
plain
raw-boned
woman
of
great
strength
but
her
health
visibly
declined
from
the
time
of
her
advent
she
was
greatly
devoted
to
her
unfortunate
sister
and
had
an
especial
affection
for
her
only
surviving
nephew
william
who
from
a
sturdy
infant
had
become
a
sickly
spindling
lad
in
this
year
the
servant
mehitabel
died
and
the
other
servant
preserved
smith
left
without
coherent
explanation--or
at
least
with
only
some
wild
tales
and
a
complaint
that
he
disliked
the
smell
of
the
place
for
a
time
mercy
could
secure
no
more
help
since
the
seven
deaths
and
case
of
madness
all
occurring
within
five
years'
space
had
begun
to
set
in
motion
the
body
of
fireside
rumor
which
later
became
so
bizarre
ultimately
however
she
obtained
new
servants
from
out
of
town
ann
white
a
morose
woman
from
that
part
of
north
kingstown
now
set
off
as
the
township
of
exeter
and
a
capable
boston
man
named
zenas
low





it
was
ann
white
who
first
gave
definite
shape
to
the
sinister
idle
talk
mercy
should
have
known
better
than
to
hire
anyone
from
the
nooseneck
hill
country
for
that
remote
bit
of
backwoods
was
then
as
now
a
seat
of
the
most
uncomfortable
superstitions
as
lately
as
1892
an
exeter
community
exhumed
a
dead
body
and
ceremoniously
burnt
its
heart
in
order
to
prevent
certain
alleged
visitations
injurious
to
the
public
health
and
peace
and
one
may
imagine
the
point
of
view
of
the
same
section
in
1768
ann's
tongue
was
perniciously
active
and
within
a
few
months
mercy
discharged
her
filling
her
place
with
a
faithful
and
amiable
amazon
from
newport
maria
robbins
meanwhile
poor
rhoby
harris
in
her
madness
gave
voice
to
dreams
and
imaginings
of
the
most
hideous
sort
at
times
her
screams
became
insupportable
and
for
long
periods
she
would
utter
shrieking
horrors
which
necessitated
her
son's
temporary
residence
with
his
cousin
peleg
harris
in
presbyterian
lane
near
the
new
college
building
the
boy
would
seem
to
improve
after
these
visits
and
had
mercy
been
as
wise
as
she
was
well-meaning
she
would
have
let
him
live
permanently
with
peleg
just
what
mrs
harris
cried
out
in
her
fits
of
violence
tradition
hesitates
to
say
or
rather
presents
such
extravagant
accounts
that
they
nullify
themselves
through
sheer
absurdity
certainly
it
sounds
absurd
to
hear
that
a
woman
educated
only
in
the
rudiments
of
french
often
shouted
for
hours
in
a
coarse
and
idiomatic
form
of
that
language
or
that
the
same
person
alone
and
guarded
complained
wildly
of
a
staring
thing
which
bit
and
chewed
at
her
in
1772
the
servant
zenas
died
and
when
mrs
harris
heard
of
it
she
laughed
with
a
shocking
delight
utterly
foreign
to
her
the
next
year
she
herself
died
and
was
laid
to
rest
in
the
north
burial
ground
beside
her
husband
upon
the
outbreak
of
trouble
with
great
britain
in
1775
william
harris
despite
his
scant
sixteen
years
and
feeble
constitution
managed
to
enlist
in
the
army
of
observation
under
general
greene
and
from
that
time
on
enjoyed
a
steady
rise
in
health
and
prestige
in
1780
as
a
captain
in
the
rhode
island
forces
in
new
jersey
under
colonel
angell
he
met
and
married
phebe
hetfield
of
elizabethtown
whom
he
brought
to
providence
upon
his
honorable
discharge
in
the
following
year
the
young
soldier's
return
was
not
a
thing
of
unmitigated
happiness
the
house
it
is
true
was
still
in
good
condition
and
the
street
had
been
widened
and
changed
in
name
from
back
street
to
benefit
street
but
mercy
dexter's
once
robust
frame
had
undergone
a
sad
and
curious
decay
so
that
she
was
now
a
stooped
and
pathetic
figure
with
hollow
voice
and
disconcerting
pallor--qualities
shared
to
a
singular
degree
by
the
one
remaining
servant
maria
in
the
autumn
of
1782
phebe
harris
gave
birth
to
a
still-born
daughter
and
on
the
fifteenth
of
the
next
may
mercy
dexter
took
leave
of
a
useful
austere
and
virtuous
life
william
harris
at
last
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
radically
unhealthful
nature
of
his
abode
now
took
steps
toward
quitting
it
and
closing
it
for
ever
securing
temporary
quarters
for
himself
and
his
wife
at
the
newly
opened
golden
ball
inn
he
arranged
for
the
building
of
a
new
and
finer
house
in
westminster
street
in
the
growing
part
of
the
town
across
the
great
bridge
there
in
1785
his
son
dutee
was
born
and
there
the
family
dwelt
till
the
encroachments
of
commerce
drove
them
back
across
the
river
and
over
the
hill
to
angell
street
in
the
newer
east
side
residence
district
where
the
late
archer
harris
built
his
sumptuous
but
hideous
french-roofed
mansion
in
1876
william
and
phebe
both
succumbed
to
the
yellow
fever
epidemic
of
1797
but
dutee
was
brought
up
by
his
cousin
rathbone
harris
peleg's
son
rathbone
was
a
practical
man
and
rented
the
benefit
street
house
despite
william's
wish
to
keep
it
vacant
he
considered
it
an
obligation
to
his
ward
to
make
the
most
of
all
the
boy's
property
nor
did
he
concern
himself
with
the
deaths
and
illnesses
which
caused
so
many
changes
of
tenants
or
the
steadily
growing
aversion
with
which
the
house
was
generally
regarded
it
is
likely
that
he
felt
only
vexation
when
in
1804
the
town
council
ordered
him
to
fumigate
the
place
with
sulfur
tar
and
gum
camphor
on
account
of
the
much-discussed
deaths
of
four
persons
presumably
caused
by
the
then
diminishing
fever
epidemic
they
said
the
place
had
a
febrile
smell
dutee
himself
thought
little
of
the
house
for
he
grew
up
to
be
a
privateersman
and
served
with
distinction
on
the
vigilant
under
captain
cahoone
in
the
war
of
1812
he
returned
unharmed
married
in
1814
and
became
a
father
on
that
memorable
night
of
september
23
1815
when
a
great
gale
drove
the
waters
of
the
bay
over
half
the
town
and
floated
a
tall
sloop
well
up
westminster
street
so
that
its
masts
almost
tapped
the
harris
windows
in
symbolic
affirmation
that
the
new
boy
welcome
was
a
seaman's
son
welcome
did
not
survive
his
father
but
lived
to
perish
gloriously
at
fredericksburg
in
1862
neither
he
nor
his
son
archer
knew
of
the
shunned
house
as
other
than
a
nuisance
almost
impossible
to
rent--perhaps
on
account
of
the
mustiness
and
sickly
odor
of
unkempt
old
age
indeed
it
never
was
rented
after
a
series
of
deaths
culminating
in
1861
which
the
excitement
of
the
war
tended
to
throw
into
obscurity
carrington
harris
last
of
the
male
line
knew
it
only
as
a
deserted
and
somewhat
picturesque
center
of
legend
until
i
told
him
my
experience
he
had
meant
to
tear
it
down
and
build
an
apartment
house
on
the
site
but
after
my
account
decided
to
let
it
stand
install
plumbing
and
rent
it
nor
has
he
yet
had
any
difficulty
in
obtaining
tenants
the
horror
has
gone
3
it
may
well
be
imagined
how
powerfully
i
was
affected
by
the
annals
of
the
harrises
in
this
continuous
record
there
seemed
to
me
to
brood
a
persistent
evil
beyond
anything
in
nature
as
i
had
known
it
an
evil
clearly
connected
with
the
house
and
not
with
the
family
this
impression
was
confirmed
by
my
uncle's
less
systematic
array
of
miscellaneous
data--legends
transcribed
from
servant
gossip
cuttings
from
the
papers
copies
of
death
certificates
by
fellow-physicians
and
the
like
all
of
this
material
i
cannot
hope
to
give
for
my
uncle
was
a
tireless
antiquarian
and
very
deeply
interested
in
the
shunned
house
but
i
may
refer
to
several
dominant
points
which
earn
notice
by
their
recurrence
through
many
reports
from
diverse
sources
for
example
the
servant
gossip
was
practically
unanimous
in
attributing
to
the
fungous
and
malodorous
cellar
of
the
house
a
vast
supremacy
in
evil
influence
there
had
been
servants--ann
white
especially--who
would
not
use
the
cellar
kitchen
and
at
least
three
well-defined
legends
bore
upon
the
queer
quasi-human
or
diabolic
outlines
assumed
by
tree-roots
and
patches
of
mold
in
that
region
these
latter
narratives
interested
me
profoundly
on
account
of
what
i
had
seen
in
my
boyhood
but
i
felt
that
most
of
the
significance
had
in
each
case
been
largely
obscured
by
additions
from
the
common
stock
of
local
ghost
lore
ann
white
with
her
exeter
superstition
had
promulgated
the
most
extravagant
and
at
the
same
time
most
consistent
tale
alleging
that
there
must
lie
buried
beneath
the
house
one
of
those
vampires--the
dead
who
retain
their
bodily
form
and
live
on
the
blood
or
breath
of
the
living--whose
hideous
legions
send
their
preying
shapes
or
spirits
abroad
by
night
to
destroy
a
vampire
one
must
the
grandmothers
say
exhume
it
and
burn
its
heart
or
at
least
drive
a
stake
through
that
organ
and
ann's
dogged
insistence
on
a
search
under
the
cellar
had
been
prominent
in
bringing
about
her
discharge
her
tales
however
commanded
a
wide
audience
and
were
the
more
readily
accepted
because
the
house
indeed
stood
on
land
once
used
for
burial
purposes
to
me
their
interest
depended
less
on
this
circumstance
than
on
the
peculiarly
appropriate
way
in
which
they
dovetailed
with
certain
other
things--the
complaint
of
the
departing
servant
preserved
smith
who
had
preceded
ann
and
never
heard
of
her
that
something
sucked
his
breath
at
night
the
death-certificates
of
the
fever
victims
of
1804
issued
by
doctor
chad
hopkins
and
showing
the
four
deceased
persons
all
unaccountably
lacking
in
blood
and
the
obscure
passages
of
poor
rhoby
harris's
ravings
where
she
complained
of
the
sharp
teeth
of
a
glassy-eyed
half-visible
presence
free
from
unwarranted
superstition
though
i
am
these
things
produced
in
me
an
odd
sensation
which
was
intensified
by
a
pair
of
widely
separated
newspaper
cuttings
relating
to
deaths
in
the
shunned
house--one
from
the
providence
gazette
and
country-journal
of
april
12
1815
and
the
other
from
the
daily
transcript
and
chronicle
of
october
27
1845--each
of
which
detailed
an
appallingly
grisly
circumstance
whose
duplication
was
remarkable
it
seems
that
in
both
instances
the
dying
person
in
1815
a
gentle
old
lady
named
stafford
and
in
1845
a
schoolteacher
of
middle
age
named
eleazar
durfee
became
transfigured
in
a
horrible
way
glaring
glassily
and
attempting
to
bite
the
throat
of
the
attending
physician
even
more
puzzling
though
was
the
final
case
which
put
an
end
to
the
renting
of
the
house--a
series
of
anemia
deaths
preceded
by
progressive
madnesses
wherein
the
patient
would
craftily
attempt
the
lives
of
his
relatives
by
incisions
in
the
neck
or
wrist
this
was
in
1860
and
1861
when
my
uncle
had
just
begun
his
medical
practise
and
before
leaving
for
the
front
he
heard
much
of
it
from
his
elder
professional
colleagues
the
really
inexplicable
thing
was
the
way
in
which
the
victims--ignorant
people
for
the
ill-smelling
and
widely
shunned
house
could
now
be
rented
to
no
others--would
babble
maledictions
in
french
a
language
they
could
not
possibly
have
studied
to
any
extent
it
made
one
think
of
poor
rhoby
harris
nearly
a
century
before
and
so
moved
my
uncle
that
he
commenced
collecting
historical
data
on
the
house
after
listening
some
time
subsequent
to
his
return
from
the
war
to
the
first-hand
account
of
doctors
chase
and
whitmarsh
indeed
i
could
see
that
my
uncle
had
thought
deeply
on
the
subject
and
that
he
was
glad
of
my
own
interest--an
open-minded
and
sympathetic
interest
which
enabled
him
to
discuss
with
me
matters
at
which
others
would
merely
have
laughed
his
fancy
had
not
gone
so
far
as
mine
but
he
felt
that
the
place
was
rare
in
its
imaginative
potentialities
and
worthy
of
note
as
an
inspiration
in
the
field
of
the
grotesque
and
macabre
for
my
part
i
was
disposed
to
take
the
whole
subject
with
profound
seriousness
and
began
at
once
not
only
to
review
the
evidence
but
to
accumulate
as
much
more
as
i
could
i
talked
with
the
elderly
archer
harris
then
owner
of
the
house
many
times
before
his
death
in
1916
and
obtained
from
him
and
his
still
surviving
maiden
sister
alice
an
authentic
corroboration
of
all
the
family
data
my
uncle
had
collected
when
however
i
asked
them
what
connection
with
france
or
its
language
the
house
could
have
they
confessed
themselves
as
frankly
baffled
and
ignorant
as
i
archer
knew
nothing
and
all
that
miss
harris
could
say
was
that
an
old
allusion
her
grandfather
dutee
harris
had
heard
of
might
have
shed
a
little
light
the
old
seaman
who
had
survived
his
son
welcome's
death
in
battle
by
two
years
had
not
himself
known
the
legend
but
recalled
that
his
earliest
nurse
the
ancient
maria
robbins
seemed
darkly
aware
of
something
that
might
have
lent
a
weird
significance
to
the
french
raving
of
rhoby
harris
which
she
had
so
often
heard
during
the
last
days
of
that
hapless
woman
maria
had
been
at
the
shunned
house
from
1769
till
the
removal
of
the
family
in
1783
and
had
seen
mercy
dexter
die
once
she
hinted
to
the
child
dutee
of
a
somewhat
peculiar
circumstance
in
mercy's
last
moments
but
he
had
soon
forgotten
all
about
it
save
that
it
was
something
peculiar
the
granddaughter
moreover
recalled
even
this
much
with
difficulty
she
and
her
brother
were
not
so
much
interested
in
the
house
as
was
archer's
son
carrington
the
present
owner
with
whom
i
talked
after
my
experience





having
exhausted
the
harris
family
of
all
the
information
it
could
furnish
i
turned
my
attention
to
early
town
records
and
deeds
with
a
zeal
more
penetrating
than
that
which
my
uncle
had
occasionally
shown
in
the
same
work
what
i
wished
was
a
comprehensive
history
of
the
site
from
its
very
settlement
in
1636--or
even
before
if
any
narragansett
indian
legend
could
be
unearthed
to
supply
the
data
i
found
at
the
start
that
the
land
had
been
part
of
the
long
strip
of
home
lot
granted
originally
to
john
throckmorton
one
of
many
similar
strips
beginning
at
the
town
street
beside
the
river
and
extending
up
over
the
hill
to
a
line
roughly
corresponding
with
the
modern
hope
street
the
throckmorton
lot
had
later
of
course
been
much
subdivided
and
i
became
very
assiduous
in
tracing
that
section
through
which
back
or
benefit
street
was
later
run
it
had
as
rumor
indeed
said
been
the
throckmorton
graveyard
but
as
i
examined
the
records
more
carefully
i
found
that
the
graves
had
all
been
transferred
at
an
early
date
to
the
north
burial
ground
on
the
pawtucket
west
road
then
suddenly
i
came--by
a
rare
piece
of
chance
since
it
was
not
in
the
main
body
of
records
and
might
easily
have
been
missed--upon
something
which
aroused
my
keenest
eagerness
fitting
in
as
it
did
with
several
of
the
queerest
phases
of
the
affair
it
was
the
record
of
a
lease
in
1697
of
a
small
tract
of
ground
to
an
etienne
roulet
and
wife
at
last
the
french
element
had
appeared--that
and
another
deeper
element
of
horror
which
the
name
conjured
up
from
the
darkest
recesses
of
my
weird
and
heterogeneous
reading--and
i
feverishly
studied
the
platting
of
the
locality
as
it
had
been
before
the
cutting
through
and
partial
straightening
of
back
street
between
1747
and
1758
i
found
what
i
had
half
expected
that
where
the
shunned
house
now
stood
the
roulets
had
laid
out
their
graveyard
behind
a
one-story
and
attic
cottage
and
that
no
record
of
any
transfer
of
graves
existed
the
document
indeed
ended
in
much
confusion
and
i
was
forced
to
ransack
both
the
rhode
island
historical
society
and
shepley
library
before
i
could
find
a
local
door
which
the
name
of
etienne
roulet
would
unlock
in
the
end
i
did
find
something
something
of
such
vague
but
monstrous
import
that
i
set
about
at
once
to
examine
the
cellar
of
the
shunned
house
itself
with
a
new
and
excited
minuteness
the
roulets
it
seemed
had
come
in
1696
from
east
greenwich
down
the
west
shore
of
narragansett
bay
they
were
huguenots
from
caude
and
had
encountered
much
opposition
before
the
providence
selectmen
allowed
them
to
settle
in
the
town
unpopularity
had
dogged
them
in
east
greenwich
whither
they
had
come
in
1686
after
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
and
rumor
said
that
the
cause
of
dislike
extended
beyond
mere
racial
and
national
prejudice
or
the
land
disputes
which
involved
other
french
settlers
with
the
english
in
rivalries
which
not
even
governor
andros
could
quell
but
their
ardent
protestantism--too
ardent
some
whispered--and
their
evident
distress
when
virtually
driven
from
the
village
down
the
bay
had
moved
the
sympathy
of
the
town
fathers
here
the
strangers
had
been
granted
a
haven
and
the
swarthy
etienne
roulet
less
apt
at
agriculture
than
at
reading
queer
books
and
drawing
queer
diagrams
was
given
a
clerical
post
in
the
warehouse
at
pardon
tillinghast's
wharf
far
south
in
town
street
there
had
however
been
a
riot
of
some
sort
later
on--perhaps
forty
years
later
after
old
roulet's
death--and
no
one
seemed
to
hear
of
the
family
after
that
for
a
century
and
more
it
appeared
the
roulets
had
been
well
remembered
and
frequently
discussed
as
vivid
incidents
in
the
quiet
life
of
a
new
england
seaport
etienne's
son
paul
a
surly
fellow
whose
erratic
conduct
had
probably
provoked
the
riot
which
wiped
out
the
family
was
particularly
a
source
of
speculation
and
though
providence
never
shared
the
witchcraft
panics
of
her
puritan
neighbors
it
was
freely
intimated
by
old
wives
that
his
prayers
were
neither
uttered
at
the
proper
time
nor
directed
toward
the
proper
object
all
this
had
undoubtedly
formed
the
basis
of
the
legend
known
by
old
maria
robbins
what
relation
it
had
to
the
french
ravings
of
rhoby
harris
and
other
inhabitants
of
the
shunned
house
imagination
or
future
discovery
alone
could
determine
i
wondered
how
many
of
those
who
had
known
the
legends
realized
that
additional
link
with
the
terrible
which
my
wider
reading
had
given
me
that
ominous
item
in
the
annals
of
morbid
horror
which
tells
of
the
creature
jacques
roulet
of
caude
who
in
1598
was
condemned
to
death
as
a
demoniac
but
afterward
saved
from
the
stake
by
the
paris
parliament
and
shut
in
a
madhouse
he
had
been
found
covered
with
blood
and
shreds
of
flesh
in
a
wood
shortly
after
the
killing
and
rending
of
a
boy
by
a
pair
of
wolves
one
wolf
was
seen
to
lope
away
unhurt
surely
a
pretty
hearthside
tale
with
a
queer
significance
as
to
name
and
place
but
i
decided
that
the
providence
gossips
could
not
have
generally
known
of
it
had
they
known
the
coincidence
of
names
would
have
brought
some
drastic
and
frightened
action--indeed
might
not
its
limited
whispering
have
precipitated
the
final
riot
which
erased
the
roulets
from
the
town





i
now
visited
the
accursed
place
with
increased
frequency
studying
the
unwholesome
vegetation
of
the
garden
examining
all
the
walls
of
the
building
and
poring
over
every
inch
of
the
earthen
cellar
floor
finally
with
carrington
harris's
permission
i
fitted
a
key
to
the
disused
door
opening
from
the
cellar
directly
upon
benefit
street
preferring
to
have
a
more
immediate
access
to
the
outside
world
than
the
dark
stairs
ground-floor
hall
and
front
door
could
give
there
where
morbidity
lurked
most
thickly
i
searched
and
poked
during
long
afternoons
when
the
sunlight
filtered
in
through
the
cobwebbed
above-ground
windows
and
a
sense
of
security
glowed
from
the
unlocked
door
which
placed
me
only
a
few
feet
from
the
placid
sidewalk
outside
nothing
new
rewarded
my
efforts--only
the
same
depressing
mustiness
and
faint
suggestions
of
noxious
odors
and
nitrous
outlines
on
the
floor--and
i
fancy
that
many
pedestrians
must
have
watched
me
curiously
through
the
broken
panes
at
length
upon
a
suggestion
of
my
uncle's
i
decided
to
try
the
spot
nocturnally
and
one
stormy
midnight
ran
the
beams
of
an
electric
torch
over
the
moldy
floor
with
its
uncanny
shapes
and
distorted
half-phosphorescent
fungi
the
place
had
dispirited
me
curiously
that
evening
and
i
was
almost
prepared
when
i
saw--or
thought
i
saw--amidst
the
whitish
deposits
a
particularly
sharp
definition
of
the
huddled
form
i
had
suspected
from
boyhood
its
clearness
was
astonishing
and
unprecedented--and
as
i
watched
i
seemed
to
see
again
the
thin
yellowish
shimmering
exhalation
which
had
startled
me
on
that
rainy
afternoon
so
many
years
before
above
the
anthropomorphic
patch
of
mold
by
the
fireplace
it
rose
a
subtle
sickish
almost
luminous
vapor
which
as
it
hung
trembling
in
the
dampness
seemed
to
develop
vague
and
shocking
suggestions
of
form
gradually
trailing
off
into
nebulous
decay
and
passing
up
into
the
blackness
of
the
great
chimney
with
a
fetor
in
its
wake
it
was
truly
horrible
and
the
more
so
to
me
because
of
what
i
knew
of
the
spot
refusing
to
flee
i
watched
it
fade--and
as
i
watched
i
felt
that
it
was
in
turn
watching
me
greedily
with
eyes
more
imaginable
than
visible
when
i
told
my
uncle
about
it
he
was
greatly
aroused
and
after
a
tense
hour
of
reflection
arrived
at
a
definite
and
drastic
decision
weighing
in
his
mind
the
importance
of
the
matter
and
the
significance
of
our
relation
to
it
he
insisted
that
we
both
test--and
if
possible
destroy--the
horror
of
the
house
by
a
joint
night
or
nights
of
aggressive
vigil
in
that
musty
and
fungus-cursed
cellar
4
on
wednesday
june
25
1919
after
a
proper
notification
of
carrington
harris
which
did
not
include
surmises
as
to
what
we
expected
to
find
my
uncle
and
i
conveyed
to
the
shunned
house
two
camp
chairs
and
a
folding
camp
cot
together
with
some
scientific
mechanism
of
greater
weight
and
intricacy
these
we
placed
in
the
cellar
during
the
day
screening
the
windows
with
paper
and
planning
to
return
in
the
evening
for
our
first
vigil
we
had
locked
the
door
from
the
cellar
to
the
ground
floor
and
having
a
key
to
the
outside
cellar
door
were
prepared
to
leave
our
expensive
and
delicate
apparatus--which
we
had
obtained
secretly
and
at
great
cost--as
many
days
as
our
vigils
might
be
protracted
it
was
our
design
to
sit
up
together
till
very
late
and
then
watch
singly
till
dawn
in
two-hour
stretches
myself
first
and
then
my
companion
the
inactive
member
resting
on
the
cot
the
natural
leadership
with
which
my
uncle
procured
the
instruments
from
the
laboratories
of
brown
university
and
the
cranston
street
armory
and
instinctively
assumed
direction
of
our
venture
was
a
marvelous
commentary
on
the
potential
vitality
and
resilience
of
a
man
of
eighty-one
elihu
whipple
had
lived
according
to
the
hygienic
laws
he
had
preached
as
a
physician
and
but
for
what
happened
later
would
be
here
in
full
vigor
today
only
two
persons
suspected
what
did
happen--carrington
harris
and
myself
i
had
to
tell
harris
because
he
owned
the
house
and
deserved
to
know
what
had
gone
out
of
it
then
too
we
had
spoken
to
him
in
advance
of
our
quest
and
i
felt
after
my
uncle's
going
that
he
would
understand
and
assist
me
in
some
vitally
necessary
public
explanations
he
turned
very
pale
but
agreed
to
help
me
and
decided
that
it
would
now
be
safe
to
rent
the
house
to
declare
that
we
were
not
nervous
on
that
rainy
night
of
watching
would
be
an
exaggeration
both
gross
and
ridiculous
we
were
not
as
i
have
said
in
any
sense
childishly
superstitious
but
scientific
study
and
reflection
had
taught
us
that
the
known
universe
of
three
dimensions
embraces
the
merest
fraction
of
the
whole
cosmos
of
substance
and
energy
in
this
case
an
overwhelming
preponderance
of
evidence
from
numerous
authentic
sources
pointed
to
the
tenacious
existence
of
certain
forces
of
great
power
and
so
far
as
the
human
point
of
view
is
concerned
exceptional
malignancy
to
say
that
we
actually
believed
in
vampires
or
werewolves
would
be
a
carelessly
inclusive
statement
rather
must
it
be
said
that
we
were
not
prepared
to
deny
the
possibility
of
certain
unfamiliar
and
unclassified
modifications
of
vital
force
and
attenuated
matter
existing
very
infrequently
in
three-dimensional
space
because
of
its
more
intimate
connection
with
other
spatial
units
yet
close
enough
to
the
boundary
of
our
own
to
furnish
us
occasional
manifestations
which
we
for
lack
of
a
proper
vantage-point
may
never
hope
to
understand
in
short
it
seemed
to
my
uncle
and
me
that
an
incontrovertible
array
of
facts
pointed
to
some
lingering
influence
in
the
shunned
house
traceable
to
one
or
another
of
the
ill-favored
french
settlers
of
two
centuries
before
and
still
operative
through
rare
and
unknown
laws
of
atomic
and
electronic
motion
that
the
family
of
roulet
had
possessed
an
abnormal
affinity
for
outer
circles
of
entity--dark
spheres
which
for
normal
folk
hold
only
repulsion
and
terror--their
recorded
history
seemed
to
prove
had
not
then
the
riots
of
those
bygone
seventeen-thirties
set
moving
certain
kinetic
patterns
in
the
morbid
brain
of
one
or
more
of
them--notably
the
sinister
paul
roulet--which
obscurely
survived
the
bodies
murdered
and
buried
by
the
mob
and
continued
to
function
in
some
multiple-dimensioned
space
along
the
original
lines
of
force
determined
by
a
frantic
hatred
of
the
encroaching
community
such
a
thing
was
surely
not
a
physical
or
biochemical
impossibility
in
the
light
of
a
newer
science
which
includes
the
theories
of
relativity
and
intra-atomic
action
one
might
easily
imagine
an
alien
nucleus
of
substance
or
energy
formless
or
otherwise
kept
alive
by
imperceptible
or
immaterial
subtractions
from
the
life-force
or
bodily
tissue
and
fluids
of
other
and
more
palpably
living
things
into
which
it
penetrates
and
with
whose
fabric
it
sometimes
completely
merges
itself
it
might
be
actively
hostile
or
it
might
be
dictated
merely
by
blind
motives
of
self-preservation
in
any
case
such
a
monster
must
of
necessity
be
in
our
scheme
of
things
an
anomaly
and
an
intruder
whose
extirpation
forms
a
primary
duty
with
every
man
not
an
enemy
to
the
world's
life
health
and
sanity
what
baffled
us
was
our
utter
ignorance
of
the
aspect
in
which
we
might
encounter
the
thing
no
sane
person
had
ever
seen
it
and
few
had
ever
felt
it
definitely
it
might
be
pure
energy--a
form
ethereal
and
outside
the
realm
of
substance--or
it
might
be
partly
material
some
unknown
and
equivocal
mass
of
plasticity
capable
of
changing
at
will
to
nebulous
approximations
of
the
solid
liquid
gaseous
or
tenuously
unparticled
states
the
anthropomorphic
patch
of
mold
on
the
floor
the
form
of
the
yellowish
vapor
and
the
curvature
of
the
tree-roots
in
some
of
the
old
tales
all
argued
at
least
a
remote
and
reminiscent
connection
with
the
human
shape
but
how
representative
or
permanent
that
similarity
might
be
none
could
say
with
any
kind
of
certainty





we
had
devised
two
weapons
to
fight
it
a
large
and
specially
fitted
crookes
tube
operated
by
powerful
storage
batteries
and
provided
with
peculiar
screens
and
reflectors
in
case
it
proved
intangible
and
opposable
only
by
vigorously
destructive
ether
radiations
and
a
pair
of
military
flame-throwers
of
the
sort
used
in
the
world
war
in
case
it
proved
partly
material
and
susceptible
of
mechanical
destruction--for
like
the
superstitious
exeter
rustics
we
were
prepared
to
burn
the
thing's
heart
out
if
heart
existed
to
burn
all
this
aggressive
mechanism
we
set
in
the
cellar
in
positions
carefully
arranged
with
reference
to
the
cot
and
chairs
and
to
the
spot
before
the
fireplace
where
the
mold
had
taken
strange
shapes
that
suggestive
patch
by
the
way
was
only
faintly
visible
when
we
placed
our
furniture
and
instruments
and
when
we
returned
that
evening
for
the
actual
vigil
for
a
moment
i
half
doubted
that
i
had
ever
seen
it
in
the
more
definitely
limned
form--but
then
i
thought
of
the
legends
our
cellar
vigil
began
at
ten
p
m
daylight
saving
time
and
as
it
continued
we
found
no
promise
of
pertinent
developments
a
weak
filtered
glow
from
the
rain-harassed
street-lamps
outside
and
a
feeble
phosphorescence
from
the
detestable
fungi
within
showed
the
dripping
stone
of
the
walls
from
which
all
traces
of
whitewash
had
vanished
the
dank
fetid
and
mildew-tainted
hard
earth
floor
with
its
obscene
fungi
the
rotting
remains
of
what
had
been
stools
chairs
and
tables
and
other
more
shapeless
furniture
the
heavy
planks
and
massive
beams
of
the
ground
floor
overhead
the
decrepit
plank
door
leading
to
bins
and
chambers
beneath
other
parts
of
the
house
the
crumbling
stone
staircase
with
ruined
wooden
hand-rail
and
the
crude
and
cavernous
fireplace
of
blackened
brick
where
rusted
iron
fragments
revealed
the
past
presence
of
hooks
andirons
spit
crane
and
a
door
to
the
dutch
oven--these
things
and
our
austere
cot
and
camp
chairs
and
the
heavy
and
intricate
destructive
machinery
we
had
brought
we
had
as
in
my
own
former
explorations
left
the
door
to
the
street
unlocked
so
that
a
direct
and
practical
path
of
escape
might
lie
open
in
case
of
manifestations
beyond
our
power
to
deal
with
it
was
our
idea
that
our
continued
nocturnal
presence
would
call
forth
whatever
malign
entity
lurked
there
and
that
being
prepared
we
could
dispose
of
the
thing
with
one
or
the
other
of
our
provided
means
as
soon
as
we
had
recognized
and
observed
it
sufficiently
how
long
it
might
require
to
evoke
and
extinguish
the
thing
we
had
no
notion
it
occurred
to
us
too
that
our
venture
was
far
from
safe
for
in
what
strength
the
thing
might
appear
no
one
could
tell
but
we
deemed
the
game
worth
the
hazard
and
embarked
on
it
alone
and
unhesitatingly
conscious
that
the
seeking
of
outside
aid
would
only
expose
us
to
ridicule
and
perhaps
defeat
our
entire
purpose
such
was
our
frame
of
mind
as
we
talked--far
into
the
night
till
my
uncle's
growing
drowsiness
made
me
remind
him
to
lie
down
for
his
two-hour
sleep
something
like
fear
chilled
me
as
i
sat
there
in
the
small
hours
alone--i
say
alone
for
one
who
sits
by
a
sleeper
is
indeed
alone
perhaps
more
alone
than
he
can
realize
my
uncle
breathed
heavily
his
deep
inhalations
and
exhalations
accompanied
by
the
rain
outside
and
punctuated
by
another
nerve-racking
sound
of
distant
dripping
water
within--for
the
house
was
repulsively
damp
even
in
dry
weather
and
in
this
storm
positively
swamp-like
i
studied
the
loose
antique
masonry
of
the
walls
in
the
fungus-light
and
the
feeble
rays
which
stole
in
from
the
street
through
the
screened
window
and
once
when
the
noisome
atmosphere
of
the
place
seemed
about
to
sicken
me
i
opened
the
door
and
looked
up
and
down
the
street
feasting
my
eyes
on
familiar
sights
and
my
nostrils
on
wholesome
air
still
nothing
occurred
to
reward
my
watching
and
i
yawned
repeatedly
fatigue
getting
the
better
of
apprehension
then
the
stirring
of
my
uncle
in
his
sleep
attracted
my
notice
he
had
turned
restlessly
on
the
cot
several
times
during
the
latter
half
of
the
first
hour
but
now
he
was
breathing
with
unusual
irregularity
occasionally
heaving
a
sigh
which
held
more
than
a
few
of
the
qualities
of
a
choking
moan
i
turned
my
electric
flashlight
on
him
and
found
his
face
averted
so
rising
and
crossing
to
the
other
side
of
the
cot
i
again
flashed
the
light
to
see
if
he
seemed
in
any
pain
what
i
saw
unnerved
me
most
surprisingly
considering
its
relative
triviality
it
must
have
been
merely
the
association
of
any
odd
circumstance
with
the
sinister
nature
of
our
location
and
mission
for
surely
the
circumstance
was
not
in
itself
frightful
or
unnatural
it
was
merely
that
my
uncle's
facial
expression
disturbed
no
doubt
by
the
strange
dreams
which
our
situation
prompted
betrayed
considerable
agitation
and
seemed
not
at
all
characteristic
of
him
his
habitual
expression
was
one
of
kindly
and
well-bred
calm
whereas
now
a
variety
of
emotions
seemed
struggling
within
him
i
think
on
the
whole
that
it
was
this
variety
which
chiefly
disturbed
me
my
uncle
as
he
gasped
and
tossed
in
increasing
perturbation
and
with
eyes
that
had
now
started
open
seemed
not
one
but
many
men
and
suggested
a
curious
quality
of
alienage
from
himself





all
at
once
he
commenced
to
mutter
and
i
did
not
like
the
look
of
his
mouth
and
teeth
as
he
spoke
the
words
were
at
first
indistinguishable
and
then--with
a
tremendous
start--i
recognized
something
about
them
which
filled
me
with
icy
fear
till
i
recalled
the
breadth
of
my
uncle's
education
and
the
interminable
translations
he
had
made
from
anthropological
and
antiquarian
articles
in
the
revue
des
deux
mondes
for
the
venerable
elihu
whipple
was
muttering
in
french
and
the
few
phrases
i
could
distinguish
seemed
connected
with
the
darkest
myths
he
had
ever
adapted
from
the
famous
paris
magazine
suddenly
a
perspiration
broke
out
on
the
sleeper's
forehead
and
he
leaped
abruptly
up
half
awake
the
jumble
of
french
changed
to
a
cry
in
english
and
the
hoarse
voice
shouted
excitedly
my
breath
my
breath
then
the
awakening
became
complete
and
with
a
subsidence
of
facial
expression
to
the
normal
state
my
uncle
seized
my
hand
and
began
to
relate
a
dream
whose
nucleus
of
significance
i
could
only
surmise
with
a
kind
of
awe
he
had
he
said
floated
off
from
a
very
ordinary
series
of
dream-pictures
into
a
scene
whose
strangeness
was
related
to
nothing
he
had
ever
read
it
was
of
this
world
and
yet
not
of
it--a
shadowy
geometrical
confusion
in
which
could
be
seen
elements
of
familiar
things
in
most
unfamiliar
and
perturbing
combinations
there
was
a
suggestion
of
queerly
disordered
pictures
superimposed
one
upon
another
an
arrangement
in
which
the
essentials
of
time
as
well
as
of
space
seemed
dissolved
and
mixed
in
the
most
illogical
fashion
in
this
kaleidoscopic
vortex
of
phantasmal
images
were
occasional
snap-shots
if
one
might
use
the
term
of
singular
clearness
but
unaccountable
heterogeneity
once
my
uncle
thought
he
lay
in
a
carelessly
dug
open
pit
with
a
crowd
of
angry
faces
framed
by
straggling
locks
and
three-cornered
hats
frowning
down
on
him
again
he
seemed
to
be
in
the
interior
of
a
house--an
old
house
apparently--but
the
details
and
inhabitants
were
constantly
changing
and
he
could
never
be
certain
of
the
faces
or
the
furniture
or
even
of
the
room
itself
since
doors
and
windows
seemed
in
just
as
great
a
state
of
flux
as
the
presumably
more
mobile
objects
it
was
queer--damnably
queer--and
my
uncle
spoke
almost
sheepishly
as
if
half
expecting
not
to
be
believed
when
he
declared
that
of
the
strange
faces
many
had
unmistakably
borne
the
features
of
the
harris
family
and
all
the
while
there
was
a
personal
sensation
of
choking
as
if
some
pervasive
presence
had
spread
itself
through
his
body
and
sought
to
possess
itself
of
his
vital
processes
i
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
those
vital
processes
worn
as
they
were
by
eighty-one
years
of
continuous
functioning
in
conflict
with
unknown
forces
of
which
the
youngest
and
strongest
system
might
well
be
afraid
but
in
another
moment
reflected
that
dreams
are
only
dreams
and
that
these
uncomfortable
visions
could
be
at
most
no
more
than
my
uncle's
reaction
to
the
investigations
and
expectations
which
had
lately
filled
our
minds
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
conversation
also
soon
tended
to
dispel
my
sense
of
strangeness
and
in
time
i
yielded
to
my
yawns
and
took
my
turn
at
slumber
my
uncle
seemed
now
very
wakeful
and
welcomed
his
period
of
watching
even
though
the
nightmare
had
aroused
him
far
ahead
of
his
allotted
two
hours
sleep
seized
me
quickly
and
i
was
at
once
haunted
with
dreams
of
the
most
disturbing
kind
i
felt
in
my
visions
a
cosmic
and
abysmal
loneness
with
hostility
surging
from
all
sides
upon
some
prison
where
i
lay
confined
i
seemed
bound
and
gagged
and
taunted
by
the
echoing
yells
of
distant
multitudes
who
thirsted
for
my
blood
my
uncle's
face
came
to
me
with
less
pleasant
association
than
in
waking
hours
and
i
recall
many
futile
struggles
and
attempts
to
scream
it
was
not
a
pleasant
sleep
and
for
a
second
i
was
not
sorry
for
the
echoing
shriek
which
clove
through
the
barriers
of
dream
and
flung
me
to
a
sharp
and
startled
awakeness
in
which
every
actual
object
before
my
eyes
stood
out
with
more
than
natural
clearness
and
reality
5
i
had
been
lying
with
my
face
away
from
my
uncle's
chair
so
that
in
this
sudden
flash
of
awakening
i
saw
only
the
door
to
the
street
the
window
and
the
wall
and
floor
and
ceiling
toward
the
north
of
the
room
all
photographed
with
morbid
vividness
on
my
brain
in
a
light
brighter
than
the
glow
of
the
fungi
or
the
rays
from
the
street
outside
it
was
not
a
strong
or
even
a
fairly
strong
light
certainly
not
nearly
strong
enough
to
read
an
average
book
by
but
it
cast
a
shadow
of
myself
and
the
cot
on
the
floor
and
had
a
yellowish
penetrating
force
that
hinted
at
things
more
potent
than
luminosity
this
i
perceived
with
unhealthy
sharpness
despite
the
fact
that
two
of
my
other
senses
were
violently
assailed
for
on
my
ears
rang
the
reverberations
of
that
shocking
scream
while
my
nostrils
revolted
at
the
stench
which
filled
the
place
my
mind
as
alert
as
my
senses
recognized
the
gravely
unusual
and
almost
automatically
i
leaped
up
and
turned
about
to
grasp
the
destructive
instruments
which
we
had
left
trained
on
the
moldy
spot
before
the
fireplace
as
i
turned
i
dreaded
what
i
was
to
see
for
the
scream
had
been
in
my
uncle's
voice
and
i
knew
not
against
what
menace
i
should
have
to
defend
him
and
myself
yet
after
all
the
sight
was
worse
than
i
had
dreaded
there
are
horrors
beyond
horrors
and
this
was
one
of
those
nuclei
of
all
dreamable
hideousness
which
the
cosmos
saves
to
blast
an
accursed
and
unhappy
few
out
of
the
fungus-ridden
earth
steamed
up
a
vaporous
corpse-light
yellow
and
diseased
which
bubbled
and
lapped
to
a
gigantic
height
in
vague
outlines
half
human
and
half
monstrous
through
which
i
could
see
the
chimney
and
fireplace
beyond
it
was
all
eyes--wolfish
and
mocking--and
the
rugose
insect-like
head
dissolved
at
the
top
to
a
thin
stream
of
mist
which
curled
putridly
about
and
finally
vanished
up
the
chimney
i
say
that
i
saw
this
thing
but
it
is
only
in
conscious
retrospection
that
i
ever
definitely
traced
its
damnable
approach
to
form
at
the
time
it
was
to
me
only
a
seething
dimly
phosphorescent
cloud
of
fungous
loathsomeness
enveloping
and
dissolving
to
an
abhorrent
plasticity
the
one
object
on
which
all
my
attention
was
focussed
that
object
was
my
uncle--the
venerable
elihu
whipple--who
with
blackening
and
decaying
features
leered
and
gibbered
at
me
and
reached
out
dripping
claws
to
rend
me
in
the
fury
which
this
horror
had
brought
it
was
a
sense
of
routine
which
kept
me
from
going
mad
i
had
drilled
myself
in
preparation
for
the
crucial
moment
and
blind
training
saved
me
recognizing
the
bubbling
evil
as
no
substance
reachable
by
matter
or
material
chemistry
and
therefore
ignoring
the
flame-thrower
which
loomed
on
my
left
i
threw
on
the
current
of
the
crookes
tube
apparatus
and
focussed
toward
that
scene
of
immortal
blasphemousness
the
strongest
ether
radiations
which
man's
art
can
arouse
from
the
spaces
and
fluids
of
nature
there
was
a
bluish
haze
and
a
frenzied
sputtering
and
the
yellowish
phosphorescence
grew
dimmer
to
my
eyes
but
i
saw
the
dimness
was
only
that
of
contrast
and
that
the
waves
from
the
machine
had
no
effect
whatever
then
in
the
midst
of
that
demoniac
spectacle
i
saw
a
fresh
horror
which
brought
cries
to
my
lips
and
sent
me
fumbling
and
staggering
toward
that
unlocked
door
to
the
quiet
street
careless
of
what
abnormal
terrors
i
loosed
upon
the
world
or
what
thoughts
or
judgments
of
men
i
brought
down
upon
my
head
in
that
dim
blend
of
blue
and
yellow
the
form
of
my
uncle
had
commenced
a
nauseous
liquefaction
whose
essence
eludes
all
description
and
in
which
there
played
across
his
vanishing
face
such
changes
of
identity
as
only
madness
can
conceive
he
was
at
once
a
devil
and
a
multitude
a
charnel-house
and
a
pageant
lit
by
the
mixed
and
uncertain
beams
that
gelatinous
face
assumed
a
dozen--a
score--a
hundred--aspects
grinning
as
it
sank
to
the
ground
on
a
body
that
melted
like
tallow
in
the
caricatured
likeness
of
legions
strange
and
yet
not
strange
i
saw
the
features
of
the
harris
line
masculine
and
feminine
adult
and
infantile
and
other
features
old
and
young
coarse
and
refined
familiar
and
unfamiliar
for
a
second
there
flashed
a
degraded
counterfeit
of
a
miniature
of
poor
mad
rhoby
harris
that
i
had
seen
in
the
school
of
design
museum
and
another
time
i
thought
i
caught
the
raw-boned
image
of
mercy
dexter
as
i
recalled
her
from
a
painting
in
carrington
harris's
house
it
was
frightful
beyond
conception
toward
the
last
when
a
curious
blend
of
servant
and
baby
visages
flickered
close
to
the
fungous
floor
where
a
pool
of
greenish
grease
was
spreading
it
seemed
as
though
the
shifting
features
fought
against
themselves
and
strove
to
form
contours
like
those
of
my
uncle's
kindly
face
i
like
to
think
that
he
existed
at
that
moment
and
that
he
tried
to
bid
me
farewell
it
seems
to
me
i
hiccupped
a
farewell
from
my
own
parched
throat
as
i
lurched
out
into
the
street
a
thin
stream
of
grease
following
me
through
the
door
to
the
rain-drenched
sidewalk





the
rest
is
shadowy
and
monstrous
there
was
no
one
in
the
soaking
street
and
in
all
the
world
there
was
no
one
i
dared
tell
i
walked
aimlessly
south
past
college
hill
and
the
athenum
down
hopkins
street
and
over
the
bridge
to
the
business
section
where
tall
buildings
seemed
to
guard
me
as
modern
material
things
guard
the
world
from
ancient
and
unwholesome
wonder
then
gray
dawn
unfolded
wetly
from
the
east
silhouetting
the
archaic
hill
and
its
venerable
steeples
and
beckoning
me
to
the
place
where
my
terrible
work
was
still
unfinished
and
in
the
end
i
went
wet
hatless
and
dazed
in
the
morning
light
and
entered
that
awful
door
in
benefit
street
which
i
had
left
ajar
and
which
still
swung
cryptically
in
full
sight
of
the
early
householders
to
whom
i
dared
not
speak
the
grease
was
gone
for
the
moldy
floor
was
porous
and
in
front
of
the
fireplace
was
no
vestige
of
the
giant
doubled-up
form
traced
in
niter
i
looked
at
the
cot
the
chairs
the
instruments
my
neglected
hat
and
the
yellowed
straw
hat
of
my
uncle
dazedness
was
uppermost
and
i
could
scarcely
recall
what
was
dream
and
what
was
reality
then
thought
trickled
back
and
i
knew
that
i
had
witnessed
things
more
horrible
than
i
had
dreamed
sitting
down
i
tried
to
conjecture
as
nearly
as
sanity
would
let
me
just
what
had
happened
and
how
i
might
end
the
horror
if
indeed
it
had
been
real
matter
it
seemed
not
to
be
nor
ether
nor
anything
else
conceivable
by
mortal
mind
what
then
but
some
exotic
emanation
some
vampirish
vapor
such
as
exeter
rustics
tell
of
as
lurking
over
certain
churchyards
this
i
felt
was
the
clue
and
again
i
looked
at
the
floor
before
the
fireplace
where
the
mold
and
niter
had
taken
strange
forms
in
ten
minutes
my
mind
was
made
up
and
taking
my
hat
i
set
out
for
home
where
i
bathed
ate
and
gave
by
telephone
an
order
for
a
pickax
a
spade
a
military
gas-mask
and
six
carboys
of
sulfuric
acid
all
to
be
delivered
the
next
morning
at
the
cellar
door
of
the
shunned
house
in
benefit
street
after
that
i
tried
to
sleep
and
failing
passed
the
hours
in
reading
and
in
the
composition
of
inane
verses
to
counteract
my
mood
at
eleven
a
m
the
next
day
i
commenced
digging
it
was
sunny
weather
and
i
was
glad
of
that
i
was
still
alone
for
as
much
as
i
feared
the
unknown
horror
i
sought
there
was
more
fear
in
the
thought
of
telling
anybody
later
i
told
harris
only
through
sheer
necessity
and
because
he
had
heard
odd
tales
from
old
people
which
disposed
him
ever
so
little
toward
belief
as
i
turned
up
the
stinking
black
earth
in
front
of
the
fireplace
my
spade
causing
a
viscous
yellow
ichor
to
ooze
from
the
white
fungi
which
it
severed
i
trembled
at
the
dubious
thoughts
of
what
i
might
uncover
some
secrets
of
inner
earth
are
not
good
for
mankind
and
this
seemed
to
me
one
of
them
my
hand
shook
perceptibly
but
still
i
delved
after
a
while
standing
in
the
large
hole
i
had
made
with
the
deepening
of
the
hole
which
was
about
six
feet
square
the
evil
smell
increased
and
i
lost
all
doubt
of
my
imminent
contact
with
the
hellish
thing
whose
emanations
had
cursed
the
house
for
over
a
century
and
a
half
i
wondered
what
it
would
look
like--what
its
form
and
substance
would
be
and
how
big
it
might
have
waxed
through
long
ages
of
life-sucking
at
length
i
climbed
out
of
the
hole
and
dispersed
the
heaped-up
dirt
then
arranging
the
great
carboys
of
acid
around
and
near
two
sides
so
that
when
necessary
i
might
empty
them
all
down
the
aperture
in
quick
succession
after
that
i
dumped
earth
only
along
the
other
two
sides
working
more
slowly
and
donning
my
gas-mask
as
the
smell
grew
i
was
nearly
unnerved
at
my
proximity
to
a
nameless
thing
at
the
bottom
of
a
pit
suddenly
my
spade
struck
something
softer
than
earth
i
shuddered
and
made
a
motion
as
if
to
climb
out
of
the
hole
which
was
now
as
deep
as
my
neck
then
courage
returned
and
i
scraped
away
more
dirt
in
the
light
of
the
electric
torch
i
had
provided
the
surface
i
uncovered
was
fishy
and
glassy--a
kind
of
semi-putrid
congealed
jelly
with
suggestions
of
translucency
i
scraped
further
and
saw
that
it
had
form
there
was
a
rift
where
a
part
of
the
substance
was
folded
over
the
exposed
area
was
huge
and
roughly
cylindrical
like
a
mammoth
soft
blue-white
stovepipe
doubled
in
two
its
largest
part
some
two
feet
in
diameter
still
more
i
scraped
and
then
abruptly
i
leaped
out
of
the
hole
and
away
from
the
filthy
thing
frantically
unstopping
and
tilting
the
heavy
carboys
and
precipitating
their
corrosive
contents
one
after
another
down
that
charnel
gulf
and
upon
the
unthinkable
abnormality
whose
titan
elbow
i
had
seen





the
blinding
maelstrom
of
greenish-yellow
vapor
which
surged
tempestuously
up
from
that
hole
as
the
floods
of
acid
descended
will
never
leave
my
memory
all
along
the
hill
people
tell
of
the
yellow
day
when
virulent
and
horrible
fumes
arose
from
the
factory
waste
dumped
in
the
providence
river
but
i
know
how
mistaken
they
are
as
to
the
source
they
tell
too
of
the
hideous
roar
which
at
the
same
time
came
from
some
disordered
water-pipe
or
gas
main
underground--but
again
i
could
correct
them
if
i
dared
it
was
unspeakably
shocking
and
i
do
not
see
how
i
lived
through
it
i
did
faint
after
emptying
the
fourth
carboy
which
i
had
to
handle
after
the
fumes
had
begun
to
penetrate
my
mask
but
when
i
recovered
i
saw
that
the
hole
was
emitting
no
fresh
vapors
the
two
remaining
carboys
i
emptied
down
without
particular
result
and
after
a
time
i
felt
it
safe
to
shovel
the
earth
back
into
the
pit
it
was
twilight
before
i

a

of

grayish
powder

one
of
earth's
nethermost
terrors
had
perished
for
ever

if

it
had
received
at

the
demon
soul
of
an
unhallowed
thing

the

spadeful
of

i
shed
the

of
the

tears
with

i

paid
unaffected
tribute
to
my
beloved
uncle's
memory
the
next

no

it
is
still
spectral

its
strangeness
fascinates
me
and
i
shall
find
mixed
with
my
relief
a
queer
regret
when
it

torn

to
make
way
for
a
tawdry

or
vulgar
apartment

gnarled
boughs
