volume
â€œthe
green
flagâ€
i
have
assembled
a
number
of
my
stories
which
deal
with
warfare
or
with
sport
in
the
present
collection
those
have
been
brought
together
which
are
concerned
with
the
grotesque
and
with
the
terribleâ€”such
tales
as
might
well
be
read
â€œround
the
fireâ€
upon
a
winterâ€™s
night
this
would
be
my
ideal
atmosphere
for
such
stories
if
an
author
might
choose
his
time
and
place
as
an
artist
does
the
light

however
if
they
have
the
good
fortune
to
give
pleasure
to
any
one
at
any
time
or
place
their
author
will
be
very
satisfied

the
leather
funnel
my
friend
lionel
dacre
lived
in
the
avenue
de
wagram
paris
his
house
was
that
small
one
with
the
iron
railings
and
grass
plot
in
front
of
it
on
the
left-hand
side
as
you
pass
down
from
the
arc
de
triomphe
i
fancy
that
it
had
been
there
long
before
the
avenue
was
constructed
for
the
grey
tiles
were
stained
with
lichens
and
the
walls
were
mildewed
and
discoloured
with
age
it
looked
a
small
house
from
the
street
five
windows
in
front
if
i
remember
right
but
it
deepened
into
a
single
long
chamber
at
the
back
it
was
here
that
dacre
had
that
singular
library
of
occult
literature
and
the
fantastic
curiosities
which
served
as
a
hobby
for
himself
and
an
amusement
for
his
friends
a
wealthy
man
of
refined
and
eccentric
tastes
he
had
spent
much
of
his
life
and
fortune
in
gathering
together
what
was
said
to
be
a
unique
private
collection
of
talmudic
cabalistic
and
magical
works
many
of
them
of
great
rarity
and
value
his
tastes
leaned
toward
the
marvellous
and
the
monstrous
and
i
have
heard
that
his
experiments
in
the
direction
of
the
unknown
have
passed
all
the
bounds
of
civilization
and
of
decorum
to
his
english
friends
he
never
alluded
to
such
matters
and
took
the
tone
of
the
student
and
virtuoso
but
a
frenchman
whose
tastes
were
of
the
same
nature
has
assured
me
that
the
worst
excesses
of
the
black
mass
have
been
perpetrated
in
that
large
and
lofty
hall
which
is
lined
with
the
shelves
of
his
books
and
the
cases
of
his
museum
dacreâ€™s
appearance
was
enough
to
show
that
his
deep
interest
in
these
psychic
matters
was
intellectual
rather
than
spiritual
there
was
no
trace
of
asceticism
upon
his
heavy
face
but
there
was
much
mental
force
in
his
huge
dome-like
skull
which
curved
upward
from
amongst
his
thinning
locks
like
a
snow-peak
above
its
fringe
of
fir
trees
his
knowledge
was
greater
than
his
wisdom
and
his
powers
were
far
superior
to
his
character
the
small
bright
eyes
buried
deeply
in
his
fleshy
face
twinkled
with
intelligence
and
an
unabated
curiosity
of
life
but
they
were
the
eyes
of
a
sensualist
and
an
egotist
enough
of
the
man
for
he
is
dead
now
poor
devil
dead
at
the
very
time
that
he
had
made
sure
that
he
had
at
last
discovered
the
elixir
of
life
it
is
not
with
his
complex
character
that
i
have
to
deal
but
with
the
very
strange
and
inexplicable
incident
which
had
its
rise
in
my
visit
to
him
in
the
early
spring
of
the
year
â€˜82
i
had
known
dacre
in
england
for
my
researches
in
the
assyrian
room
of
the
british
museum
had
been
conducted
at
the
time
when
he
was
endeavouring
to
establish
a
mystic
and
esoteric
meaning
in
the
babylonian
tablets
and
this
community
of
interests
had
brought
us
together
chance
remarks
had
led
to
daily
conversation
and
that
to
something
verging
upon
friendship
i
had
promised
him
that
on
my
next
visit
to
paris
i
would
call
upon
him
at
the
time
when
i
was
able
to
fulfil
my
compact
i
was
living
in
a
cottage
at
fontainebleau
and
as
the
evening
trains
were
inconvenient
he
asked
me
to
spend
the
night
in
his
house
â€œi
have
only
that
one
spare
couchâ€
said
he
pointing
to
a
broad
sofa
in
his
large
salon
â€œi
hope
that
you
will
manage
to
be
comfortable
thereâ€
it
was
a
singular
bedroom
with
its
high
walls
of
brown
volumes
but
there
could
be
no
more
agreeable
furniture
to
a
bookworm
like
myself
and
there
is
no
scent
so
pleasant
to
my
nostrils
as
that
faint
subtle
reek
which
comes
from
an
ancient
book
i
assured
him
that
i
could
desire
no
more
charming
chamber
and
no
more
congenial
surroundings
â€œif
the
fittings
are
neither
convenient
nor
conventional
they
are
at
least
costlyâ€
said
he
looking
round
at
his
shelves
â€œi
have
expended
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
money
upon
these
objects
which
surround
you
books
weapons
gems
carvings
tapestries
imagesâ€”there
is
hardly
a
thing
here
which
has
not
its
history
and
it
is
generally
one
worth
tellingâ€
he
was
seated
as
he
spoke
at
one
side
of
the
open
fireplace
and
i
at
the
other
his
reading
table
was
on
his
right
and
the
strong
lamp
above
it
ringed
it
with
a
very
vivid
circle
of
golden
light
a
half-rolled
palimpsest
lay
in
the
centre
and
around
it
were
many
quaint
articles
of
bric-ã
-brac
one
of
these
was
a
large
funnel
such
as
is
used
for
filling
wine
casks
it
appeared
to
be
made
of
black
wood
and
to
be
rimmed
with
discoloured
brass
â€œthat
is
a
curious
thingâ€
i
remarked
â€œwhat
is
the
history
of
thatâ€
â€œahâ€
said
he
â€œit
is
the
very
question
which
i
have
had
occasion
to
ask
myself
i
would
give
a
good
deal
to
know
take
it
in
your
hands
and
examine
itâ€
i
did
so
and
found
that
what
i
had
imagined
to
be
wood
was
in
reality
leather
though
age
had
dried
it
into
an
extreme
hardness
it
was
a
large
funnel
and
might
hold
a
quart
when
full
the
brass
rim
encircled
the
wide
end
but
the
narrow
was
also
tipped
with
metal
â€œwhat
do
you
make
of
itâ€
asked
dacre
â€œi
should
imagine
that
it
belonged
to
some
vintner
or
maltster
in
the
middle
agesâ€
said
i
â€œi
have
seen
in
england
leathern
drinking
flagons
of
the
seventeenth
centuryâ€”â€˜black
jacksâ€™
as
they
were
calledâ€”which
were
of
the
same
colour
and
hardness
as
this
fillerâ€
â€œi
dare
say
the
date
would
be
about
the
sameâ€
said
dacre
â€œand
no
doubt
also
it
was
used
for
filling
a
vessel
with
liquid
if
my
suspicions
are
correct
however
it
was
a
queer
vintner
who
used
it
and
a
very
singular
cask
which
was
filled
do
you
observe
nothing
strange
at
the
spout
end
of
the
funnelâ€
as
i
held
it
to
the
light
i
observed
that
at
a
spot
some
five
inches
above
the
brass
tip
the
narrow
neck
of
the
leather
funnel
was
all
haggled
and
scored
as
if
some
one
had
notched
it
round
with
a
blunt
knife
only
at
that
point
was
there
any
roughening
of
the
dead
black
surface
â€œsome
one
has
tried
to
cut
off
the
neckâ€
â€œwould
you
call
it
a
cutâ€
â€œit
is
torn
and
lacerated
it
must
have
taken
some
strength
to
leave
these
marks
on
such
tough
material
whatever
the
instrument
may
have
been
but
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
can
tell
that
you
know
more
than
you
sayâ€
dacre
smiled
and
his
little
eyes
twinkled
with
knowledge
â€œhave
you
included
the
psychology
of
dreams
among
your
learned
studiesâ€
he
asked
â€œi
did
not
even
know
that
there
was
such
a
psychologyâ€
â€œmy
dear
sir
that
shelf
above
the
gem
case
is
filled
with
volumes
from
albertus
magnus
onward
which
deal
with
no
other
subject
it
is
a
science
in
itselfâ€
â€œa
science
of
charlatansâ€
â€œthe
charlatan
is
always
the
pioneer
from
the
astrologer
came
the
astronomer
from
the
alchemist
the
chemist
from
the
mesmerist
the
experimental
psychologist
the
quack
of
yesterday
is
the
professor
of
to-morrow
even
such
subtle
and
elusive
things
as
dreams
will
in
time
be
reduced
to
system
and
order
when
that
time
comes
the
researches
of
our
friends
in
the
book-shelf
yonder
will
no
longer
be
the
amusement
of
the
mystic
but
the
foundations
of
a
scienceâ€
â€œsupposing
that
is
so
what
has
the
science
of
dreams
to
do
with
a
large
black
brass-rimmed
funnelâ€
â€œi
will
tell
you
you
know
that
i
have
an
agent
who
is
always
on
the
lookout
for
rarities
and
curiosities
for
my
collection
some
days
ago
he
heard
of
a
dealer
upon
one
of
the
quais
who
had
acquired
some
old
rubbish
found
in
a
cupboard
in
an
ancient
house
at
the
back
of
the
rue
mathurin
in
the
quartier
latin
the
dining-room
of
this
old
house
is
decorated
with
a
coat
of
arms
chevrons
and
bars
rouge
upon
a
field
argent
which
prove
upon
inquiry
to
be
the
shield
of
nicholas
de
la
reynie
a
high
official
of
king
louis
xiv
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
other
articles
in
the
cupboard
date
back
to
the
early
days
of
that
king
the
inference
is
therefore
that
they
were
all
the
property
of
this
nicholas
de
la
reynie
who
was
as
i
understand
the
gentleman
specially
concerned
with
the
maintenance
and
execution
of
the
draconic
laws
of
that
epochâ€
â€œwhat
thenâ€
â€œi
would
ask
you
now
to
take
the
funnel
into
your
hands
once
more
and
to
examine
the
upper
brass
rim
can
you
make
out
any
lettering
upon
itâ€
there
were
certainly
some
scratches
upon
it
almost
obliterated
by
time
the
general
effect
was
of
several
letters
the
last
of
which
bore
some
resemblance
to
a
b
â€œyou
make
it
a
bâ€
â€œyes
i
doâ€
â€œso
do
i
in
fact
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
it
is
a
bâ€
â€œbut
the
nobleman
you
mentioned
would
have
had
r
for
his
initialâ€
â€œexactly
thatâ€™s
the
beauty
of
it
he
owned
this
curious
object
and
yet
he
had
some
one
elseâ€™s
initials
upon
it
why
did
he
do
thisâ€
â€œi
canâ€™t
imagine
can
youâ€
â€œwell
i
might
perhaps
guess
do
you
observe
something
drawn
a
little
further
along
the
rimâ€
â€œi
should
say
it
was
a
crownâ€
â€œit
is
undoubtedly
a
crown
but
if
you
examine
it
in
a
good
light
you
will
convince
yourself
that
it
is
not
an
ordinary
crown
it
is
a
heraldic
crownâ€”a
badge
of
rank
and
it
consists
of
an
alternation
of
four
pearls
and
strawberry
leaves
the
proper
badge
of
a
marquis
we
may
infer
therefore
that
the
person
whose
initials
end
in
b
was
entitled
to
wear
that
coronetâ€
â€œthen
this
common
leather
filler
belonged
to
a
marquisâ€
dacre
gave
a
peculiar
smile
â€œor
to
some
member
of
the
family
of
a
marquisâ€
said
he
â€œso
much
we
have
clearly
gathered
from
this
engraved
rimâ€
â€œbut
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
dreamsâ€
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
from
a
look
upon
dacreâ€™s
face
or
from
some
subtle
suggestion
in
his
manner
but
a
feeling
of
repulsion
of
unreasoning
horror
came
upon
me
as
i
looked
at
the
gnarled
old
lump
of
leather
â€œi
have
more
than
once
received
important
information
through
my
dreamsâ€
said
my
companion
in
the
didactic
manner
which
he
loved
to
affect
â€œi
make
it
a
rule
now
when
i
am
in
doubt
upon
any
material
point
to
place
the
article
in
question
beside
me
as
i
sleep
and
to
hope
for
some
enlightenment
the
process
does
not
appear
to
me
to
be
very
obscure
though
it
has
not
yet
received
the
blessing
of
orthodox
science
according
to
my
theory
any
object
which
has
been
intimately
associated
with
any
supreme
paroxysm
of
human
emotion
whether
it
be
joy
or
pain
will
retain
a
certain
atmosphere
or
association
which
it
is
capable
of
communicating
to
a
sensitive
mind
by
a
sensitive
mind
i
do
not
mean
an
abnormal
one
but
such
a
trained
and
educated
mind
as
you
or
i
possessâ€
â€œyou
mean
for
example
that
if
i
slept
beside
that
old
sword
upon
the
wall
i
might
dream
of
some
bloody
incident
in
which
that
very
sword
took
partâ€
â€œan
excellent
example
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
sword
was
used
in
that
fashion
by
me
and
i
saw
in
my
sleep
the
death
of
its
owner
who
perished
in
a
brisk
skirmish
which
i
have
been
unable
to
identify
but
which
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
wars
of
the
frondists
if
you
think
of
it
some
of
our
popular
observances
show
that
the
fact
has
already
been
recognized
by
our
ancestors
although
we
in
our
wisdom
have
classed
it
among
superstitionsâ€
â€œfor
exampleâ€
â€œwell
the
placing
of
the
brideâ€™s
cake
beneath
the
pillow
in
order
that
the
sleeper
may
have
pleasant
dreams
that
is
one
of
several
instances
which
you
will
find
set
forth
in
a
small
brochure
which
i
am
myself
writing
upon
the
subject
but
to
come
back
to
the
point
i
slept
one
night
with
this
funnel
beside
me
and
i
had
a
dream
which
certainly
throws
a
curious
light
upon
its
use
and
originâ€
â€œwhat
did
you
dreamâ€
â€œi
dreamedâ€”â€
he
paused
and
an
intent
look
of
interest
came
over
his
massive
face
â€œby
jove
thatâ€™s
well
thought
ofâ€
said
he
â€œthis
really
will
be
an
exceedingly
interesting
experiment
you
are
yourself
a
psychic
subjectâ€”with
nerves
which
respond
readily
to
any
impressionâ€
â€œi
have
never
tested
myself
in
that
directionâ€
â€œthen
we
shall
test
you
to-night
might
i
ask
you
as
a
very
great
favour
when
you
occupy
that
couch
to-night
to
sleep
with
this
old
funnel
placed
by
the
side
of
your
pillowâ€
the
request
seemed
to
me
a
grotesque
one
but
i
have
myself
in
my
complex
nature
a
hunger
after
all
which
is
bizarre
and
fantastic
i
had
not
the
faintest
belief
in
dacreâ€™s
theory
nor
any
hopes
for
success
in
such
an
experiment
yet
it
amused
me
that
the
experiment
should
be
made
dacre
with
great
gravity
drew
a
small
stand
to
the
head
of
my
settee
and
placed
the
funnel
upon
it
then
after
a
short
conversation
he
wished
me
good-night
and
left
me





i
sat
for
some
little
time
smoking
by
the
smouldering
fire
and
turning
over
in
my
mind
the
curious
incident
which
had
occurred
and
the
strange
experience
which
might
lie
before
me
sceptical
as
i
was
there
was
something
impressive
in
the
assurance
of
dacreâ€™s
manner
and
my
extraordinary
surroundings
the
huge
room
with
the
strange
and
often
sinister
objects
which
were
hung
round
it
struck
solemnity
into
my
soul
finally
i
undressed
and
turning
out
the
lamp
i
lay
down
after
long
tossing
i
fell
asleep
let
me
try
to
describe
as
accurately
as
i
can
the
scene
which
came
to
me
in
my
dreams
it
stands
out
now
in
my
memory
more
clearly
than
anything
which
i
have
seen
with
my
waking
eyes
there
was
a
room
which
bore
the
appearance
of
a
vault
four
spandrels
from
the
corners
ran
up
to
join
a
sharp
cup-shaped
roof
the
architecture
was
rough
but
very
strong
it
was
evidently
part
of
a
great
building
three
men
in
black
with
curious
top-heavy
black
velvet
hats
sat
in
a
line
upon
a
red-carpeted
dais
their
faces
were
very
solemn
and
sad
on
the
left
stood
two
long-gowned
men
with
portfolios
in
their
hands
which
seemed
to
be
stuffed
with
papers
upon
the
right
looking
toward
me
was
a
small
woman
with
blonde
hair
and
singular
light-blue
eyesâ€”the
eyes
of
a
child
she
was
past
her
first
youth
but
could
not
yet
be
called
middle-aged
her
figure
was
inclined
to
stoutness
and
her
bearing
was
proud
and
confident
her
face
was
pale
but
serene
it
was
a
curious
face
comely
and
yet
feline
with
a
subtle
suggestion
of
cruelty
about
the
straight
strong
little
mouth
and
chubby
jaw
she
was
draped
in
some
sort
of
loose
white
gown
beside
her
stood
a
thin
eager
priest
who
whispered
in
her
ear
and
continually
raised
a
crucifix
before
her
eyes
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
fixedly
past
the
crucifix
at
the
three
men
in
black
who
were
i
felt
her
judges
as
i
gazed
the
three
men
stood
up
and
said
something
but
i
could
distinguish
no
words
though
i
was
aware
that
it
was
the
central
one
who
was
speaking
they
then
swept
out
of
the
room
followed
by
the
two
men
with
the
papers
at
the
same
instant
several
rough-looking
fellows
in
stout
jerkins
came
bustling
in
and
removed
first
the
red
carpet
and
then
the
boards
which
formed
the
dais
so
as
to
entirely
clear
the
room
when
this
screen
was
removed
i
saw
some
singular
articles
of
furniture
behind
it
one
looked
like
a
bed
with
wooden
rollers
at
each
end
and
a
winch
handle
to
regulate
its
length
another
was
a
wooden
horse
there
were
several
other
curious
objects
and
a
number
of
swinging
cords
which
played
over
pulleys
it
was
not
unlike
a
modern
gymnasium
when
the
room
had
been
cleared
there
appeared
a
new
figure
upon
the
scene
this
was
a
tall
thin
person
clad
in
black
with
a
gaunt
and
austere
face
the
aspect
of
the
man
made
me
shudder
his
clothes
were
all
shining
with
grease
and
mottled
with
stains
he
bore
himself
with
a
slow
and
impressive
dignity
as
if
he
took
command
of
all
things
from
the
instant
of
his
entrance
in
spite
of
his
rude
appearance
and
sordid
dress
it
was
now
his
business
his
room
his
to
command
he
carried
a
coil
of
light
ropes
over
his
left
fore-arm
the
lady
looked
him
up
and
down
with
a
searching
glance
but
her
expression
was
unchanged
it
was
confidentâ€”even
defiant
but
it
was
very
different
with
the
priest
his
face
was
ghastly
white
and
i
saw
the
moisture
glisten
and
run
on
his
high
sloping
forehead
he
threw
up
his
hands
in
prayer
and
he
stooped
continually
to
mutter
frantic
words
in
the
ladyâ€™s
ear
the
man
in
black
now
advanced
and
taking
one
of
the
cords
from
his
left
arm
he
bound
the
womanâ€™s
hands
together
she
held
them
meekly
toward
him
as
he
did
so
then
he
took
her
arm
with
a
rough
grip
and
led
her
toward
the
wooden
horse
which
was
little
higher
than
her
waist
on
to
this
she
was
lifted
and
laid
with
her
back
upon
it
and
her
face
to
the
ceiling
while
the
priest
quivering
with
horror
had
rushed
out
of
the
room
the
womanâ€™s
lips
were
moving
rapidly
and
though
i
could
hear
nothing
i
knew
that
she
was
praying
her
feet
hung
down
on
either
side
of
the
horse
and
i
saw
that
the
rough
varlets
in
attendance
had
fastened
cords
to
her
ankles
and
secured
the
other
ends
to
iron
rings
in
the
stone
floor
my
heart
sank
within
me
as
i
saw
these
ominous
preparations
and
yet
i
was
held
by
the
fascination
of
horror
and
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
from
the
strange
spectacle
a
man
had
entered
the
room
with
a
bucket
of
water
in
either
hand
another
followed
with
a
third
bucket
they
were
laid
beside
the
wooden
horse
the
second
man
had
a
wooden
dipperâ€”a
bowl
with
a
straight
handleâ€”in
his
other
hand
this
he
gave
to
the
man
in
black
at
the
same
moment
one
of
the
varlets
approached
with
a
dark
object
in
his
hand
which
even
in
my
dream
filled
me
with
a
vague
feeling
of
familiarity
it
was
a
leathern
filler
with
horrible
energy
he
thrust
itâ€”but
i
could
stand
no
more
my
hair
stood
on
end
with
horror
i
writhed
i
struggled
i
broke
through
the
bonds
of
sleep
and
i
burst
with
a
shriek
into
my
own
life
and
found
myself
lying
shivering
with
terror
in
the
huge
library
with
the
moonlight
flooding
through
the
window
and
throwing
strange
silver
and
black
traceries
upon
the
opposite
wall
oh
what
a
blessed
relief
to
feel
that
i
was
back
in
the
nineteenth
centuryâ€”back
out
of
that
medieval
vault
into
a
world
where
men
had
human
hearts
within
their
bosoms
i
sat
up
on
my
couch
trembling
in
every
limb
my
mind
divided
between
thankfulness
and
horror
to
think
that
such
things
were
ever
doneâ€”that
they
could
be
done
without
god
striking
the
villains
dead
was
it
all
a
fantasy
or
did
it
really
stand
for
something
which
had
happened
in
the
black
cruel
days
of
the
worldâ€™s
history
i
sank
my
throbbing
head
upon
my
shaking
hands
and
then
suddenly
my
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
in
my
bosom
and
i
could
not
even
scream
so
great
was
my
terror
something
was
advancing
toward
me
through
the
darkness
of
the
room
it
is
a
horror
coming
upon
a
horror
which
breaks
a
manâ€™s
spirit
i
could
not
reason
i
could
not
pray
i
could
only
sit
like
a
frozen
image
and
glare
at
the
dark
figure
which
was
coming
down
the
great
room
and
then
it
moved
out
into
the
white
lane
of
moonlight
and
i
breathed
once
more
it
was
dacre
and
his
face
showed
that
he
was
as
frightened
as
myself
â€œwas
that
you
for
godâ€™s
sake
whatâ€™s
the
matterâ€
he
asked
in
a
husky
voice
â€œoh
dacre
i
am
glad
to
see
you
i
have
been
down
into
hell
it
was
dreadfulâ€
â€œthen
it
was
you
who
screamedâ€
â€œi
dare
say
it
wasâ€
â€œit
rang
through
the
house
the
servants
are
all
terrifiedâ€
he
struck
a
match
and
lit
the
lamp
â€œi
think
we
may
get
the
fire
to
burn
up
againâ€
he
added
throwing
some
logs
upon
the
embers
â€œgood
god
my
dear
chap
how
white
you
are
you
look
as
if
you
had
seen
a
ghostâ€
â€œso
i
haveâ€”several
ghostsâ€
â€œthe
leather
funnel
has
acted
thenâ€
â€œi
wouldnâ€™t
sleep
near
the
infernal
thing
again
for
all
the
money
you
could
offer
meâ€
dacre
chuckled
â€œi
expected
that
you
would
have
a
lively
night
of
itâ€
said
he
â€œyou
took
it
out
of
me
in
return
for
that
scream
of
yours
wasnâ€™t
a
very
pleasant
sound
at
two
in
the
morning
i
suppose
from
what
you
say
that
you
have
seen
the
whole
dreadful
businessâ€
â€œwhat
dreadful
businessâ€
â€œthe
torture
of
the
waterâ€”the
â€˜extraordinary
questionâ€™
as
it
was
called
in
the
genial
days
of
â€˜le
roi
soleilâ€™
did
you
stand
it
out
to
the
endâ€
â€œno
thank
god
i
awoke
before
it
really
beganâ€
â€œah
it
is
just
as
well
for
you
i
held
out
till
the
third
bucket
well
it
is
an
old
story
and
they
are
all
in
their
graves
now
anyhow
so
what
does
it
matter
how
they
got
there
i
suppose
that
you
have
no
idea
what
it
was
that
you
have
seenâ€
â€œthe
torture
of
some
criminal
she
must
have
been
a
terrible
malefactor
indeed
if
her
crimes
are
in
proportion
to
her
penaltyâ€
â€œwell
we
have
that
small
consolationâ€
said
dacre
wrapping
his
dressing-gown
round
him
and
crouching
closer
to
the
fire
â€œthey
were
in
proportion
to
her
penalty
that
is
to
say
if
i
am
correct
in
the
ladyâ€™s
identityâ€
â€œhow
could
you
possibly
know
her
identityâ€
for
answer
dacre
took
down
an
old
vellum-covered
volume
from
the
shelf
â€œjust
listen
to
thisâ€
said
he
â€œit
is
in
the
french
of
the
seventeenth
century
but
i
will
give
a
rough
translation
as
i
go
you
will
judge
for
yourself
whether
i
have
solved
the
riddle
or
not
â€œthe
prisoner
was
brought
before
the
grand
chambers
and
tournelles
of
parliament
sitting
as
a
court
of
justice
charged
with
the
murder
of
master
dreux
dâ€™aubray
her
father
and
of
her
two
brothers
mm
dâ€™aubray
one
being
civil
lieutenant
and
the
other
a
counsellor
of
parliament
in
person
it
seemed
hard
to
believe
that
she
had
really
done
such
wicked
deeds
for
she
was
of
a
mild
appearance
and
of
short
stature
with
a
fair
skin
and
blue
eyes
yet
the
court
having
found
her
guilty
condemned
her
to
the
ordinary
and
to
the
extraordinary
question
in
order
that
she
might
be
forced
to
name
her
accomplices
after
which
she
should
be
carried
in
a
cart
to
the
place
de
grã¨ve
there
to
have
her
head
cut
off
her
body
being
afterwards
burned
and
her
ashes
scattered
to
the
windsâ€
the
date
of
this
entry
is
july
16
1676â€
â€œit
is
interestingâ€
said
i
â€œbut
not
convincing
how
do
you
prove
the
two
women
to
be
the
sameâ€
â€œi
am
coming
to
that
the
narrative
goes
on
to
tell
of
the
womanâ€™s
behaviour
when
questioned
â€˜when
the
executioner
approached
her
she
recognized
him
by
the
cords
which
he
held
in
his
hands
and
she
at
once
held
out
her
own
hands
to
him
looking
at
him
from
head
to
foot
without
uttering
a
wordâ€™
howâ€™s
thatâ€
â€œyes
it
was
soâ€
â€œâ€˜she
gazed
without
wincing
upon
the
wooden
horse
and
rings
which
had
twisted
so
many
limbs
and
caused
so
many
shrieks
of
agony
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
three
pails
of
water
which
were
all
ready
for
her
she
said
with
a
smile
â€œall
that
water
must
have
been
brought
here
for
the
purpose
of
drowning
me
monsieur
you
have
no
idea
i
trust
of
making
a
person
of
my
small
stature
swallow
it
allâ€â€™
shall
i
read
the
details
of
the
tortureâ€
â€œno
for
heavenâ€™s
sake
donâ€™tâ€
â€œhere
is
a
sentence
which
must
surely
show
you
that
what
is
here
recorded
is
the
very
scene
which
you
have
gazed
upon
to-night
â€˜the
good
abbã©
pirot
unable
to
contemplate
the
agonies
which
were
suffered
by
his
penitent

hurried
from
the
roomâ€™
does
that
convince
youâ€
â€œit
does
entirely
there
can
be
no
question
that
it
is
indeed
the
same
event
but
who
then
is
this
lady
whose
appearance
was
so
attractive
and
whose
end
was
so
horribleâ€
for
answer
dacre
came
across
to
me
and
placed
the
small
lamp
upon
the
table
which
stood
by
my
bed
lifting
up
the
ill-omened
filler
he
turned
the
brass
rim
so
that
the
light
fell
full
upon
it
seen
in
this
way
the
engraving
seemed
clearer
than
on
the
night
before
â€œwe
have
already
agreed
that
this
is
the
badge
of
a
marquis
or
of
a
marquiseâ€
said
he
â€œwe
have
also
settled
that
the
last
letter
is
bâ€
â€œit
is
undoubtedly
soâ€
â€œi
now
suggest
to
you
that
the
other
letters
from
left
to
right
are
m
m
a
small
d
a
a
small
d
and
then
the
final
bâ€
â€œyes
i
am
sure
that
you
are
right
i
can
make
out
the
two
small
dâ€™s
quite
plainlyâ€
â€œwhat
i
have
read
to
you
to-nightâ€
said
dacre
â€œis
the
official
record
of
the
trial
of
marie
madeleine
dâ€™aubray
marquise
de
brinvilliers
one
of
the
most
famous
poisoners
and
murderers
of
all
timeâ€
i
sat
in
silence
overwhelmed
at
the
extraordinary
nature
of
the
incident
and
at
the
completeness
of
the
proof
with
which
dacre
had
exposed
its
real
meaning
in
a
vague
way
i
remembered
some
details
of
the
womanâ€™s
career
her
unbridled
debauchery
the
coldblooded
and
protracted
torture
of
her
sick
father
the
murder
of
her
brothers
for
motives
of
petty
gain
i
recollected
also
that
the
bravery
of
her
end
had
done
something
to
atone
for
the
horror
of
her
life
and
that
all
paris
had
sympathized
with
her
last
moments
and
blessed
her
as
a
martyr
within
a
few
days
of
the
time
when
they
had
cursed
her
as
a
murderess
one
objection
and
one
only
occurred
to
my
mind
â€œhow
came
her
initials
and
her
badge
of
rank
upon
the
filler
surely
they
did
not
carry
their
medieval
homage
to
the
nobility
to
the
point
of
decorating
instruments
of
torture
with
their
titlesâ€
â€œi
was
puzzled
with
the
same
pointâ€
said
dacre
â€œbut
it
admits
of
a
simple
explanation
the
case
excited
extraordinary
interest
at
the
time
and
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
that
la
reynie
the
head
of
the
police
should
retain
this
filler
as
a
grim
souvenir
it
was
not
often
that
a
marchioness
of
france
underwent
the
extraordinary
question
that
he
should
engrave
her
initials
upon
it
for
the
information
of
others
was
surely
a
very
ordinary
proceeding
upon
his
partâ€
â€œand
thisâ€
i
asked
pointing
to
the
marks
upon
the
leathern
neck
â€œshe
was
a
cruel
tigressâ€
said
dacre
as
he
turned
away
â€œi
think
it
is
evident
that
like
other
tigresses
her
teeth
were
both
strong
and
sharpâ€
the
beetle-hunter
a
curious
experience
said
the
doctor
yes
my
friends
i
have
had
one
very
curious
experience
i
never
expect
to
have
another
for
it
is
against
all
doctrines
of
chances
that
two
such
events
would
befall
any
one
man
in
a
single
lifetime
you
may
believe
me
or
not
but
the
thing
happened
exactly
as
i
tell
it
i
had
just
become
a
medical
man
but
i
had
not
started
in
practice
and
i
lived
in
rooms
in
gower
street
the
street
has
been
renumbered
since
then
but
it
was
in
the
only
house
which
has
a
bow-window
upon
the
left-hand
side
as
you
go
down
from
the
metropolitan
station
a
widow
named
murchison
kept
the
house
at
that
time
and
she
had
three
medical
students
and
one
engineer
as
lodgers
i
occupied
the
top
room
which
was
the
cheapest
but
cheap
as
it
was
it
was
more
than
i
could
afford
my
small
resources
were
dwindling
away
and
every
week
it
became
more
necessary
that
i
should
find
something
to
do
yet
i
was
very
unwilling
to
go
into
general
practice
for
my
tastes
were
all
in
the
direction
of
science
and
especially
of
zoology
towards
which
i
had
always
a
strong
leaning
i
had
almost
given
the
fight
up
and
resigned
myself
to
being
a
medical
drudge
for
life
when
the
turning-point
of
my
struggles
came
in
a
very
extraordinary
way
one
morning
i
had
picked
up
the
standard
and
was
glancing
over
its
contents
there
was
a
complete
absence
of
news
and
i
was
about
to
toss
the
paper
down
again
when
my
eyes
were
caught
by
an
advertisement
at
the
head
of
the
personal
column
it
was
worded
in
this
wayâ€”
wanted
for
one
or
more
days
the
services
of
a
medical
man
it
is
essential
that
he
should
be
a
man
of
strong
physique
of
steady
nerves
and
of
a
resolute
nature
must
be
an
entomologistâ€”coleopterist
preferred
apply
in
person
at
77b
brook
street
application
must
be
made
before
twelve
oâ€™clock
to-day
now
i
have
already
said
that
i
was
devoted
to
zoology
of
all
branches
of
zoology
the
study
of
insects
was
the
most
attractive
to
me
and
of
all
insects
beetles
were
the
species
with
which
i
was
most
familiar
butterfly
collectors
are
numerous
but
beetles
are
far
more
varied
and
more
accessible
in
these
islands
than
are
butterflies
it
was
this
fact
which
had
attracted
my
attention
to
them
and
i
had
myself
made
a
collection
which
numbered
some
hundred
varieties
as
to
the
other
requisites
of
the
advertisement
i
knew
that
my
nerves
could
be
depended
upon
and
i
had
won
the
weight-throwing
competition
at
the
inter-hospital
sports
clearly
i
was
the
very
man
for
the
vacancy
within
five
minutes
of
my
having
read
the
advertisement
i
was
in
a
cab
and
on
my
way
to
brook
street
as
i
drove
i
kept
turning
the
matter
over
in
my
head
and
trying
to
make
a
guess
as
to
what
sort
of
employment
it
could
be
which
needed
such
curious
qualifications
a
strong
physique
a
resolute
nature
a
medical
training
and
a
knowledge
of
beetlesâ€”what
connection
could
there
be
between
these
various
requisites
and
then
there
was
the
disheartening
fact
that
the
situation
was
not
a
permanent
one
but
terminable
from
day
to
day
according
to
the
terms
of
the
advertisement
the
more
i
pondered
over
it
the
more
unintelligible
did
it
become
but
at
the
end
of
my
meditations
i
always
came
back
to
the
ground
fact
that
come
what
might
i
had
nothing
to
lose
that
i
was
completely
at
the
end
of
my
resources
and
that
i
was
ready
for
any
adventure
however
desperate
which
would
put
a
few
honest
sovereigns
into
my
pocket
the
man
fears
to
fail
who
has
to
pay
for
his
failure
but
there
was
no
penalty
which
fortune
could
exact
from
me
i
was
like
the
gambler
with
empty
pockets
who
is
still
allowed
to
try
his
luck
with
the
others
no
77b
brook
street
was
one
of
those
dingy
and
yet
imposing
houses
dun-coloured
and
flat-faced
with
the
intensely
respectable
and
solid
air
which
marks
the
georgian
builder
as
i
alighted
from
the
cab
a
young
man
came
out
of
the
door
and
walked
swiftly
down
the
street
in
passing
me
i
noticed
that
he
cast
an
inquisitive
and
somewhat
malevolent
glance
at
me
and
i
took
the
incident
as
a
good
omen
for
his
appearance
was
that
of
a
rejected
candidate
and
if
he
resented
my
application
it
meant
that
the
vacancy
was
not
yet
filled
up
full
of
hope
i
ascended
the
broad
steps
and
rapped
with
the
heavy
knocker
a
footman
in
powder
and
livery
opened
the
door
clearly
i
was
in
touch
with
people
of
wealth
and
fashion
â€œyes
sirâ€
said
the
footman
â€œi
came
in
answer
toâ€”â€”â€
â€œquite
so
sirâ€
said
the
footman
â€œlord
linchmere
will
see
you
at
once
in
the
libraryâ€
lord
linchmere
i
had
vaguely
heard
the
name
but
could
not
for
the
instant
recall
anything
about
him
following
the
footman
i
was
shown
into
a
large
book-lined
room
in
which
there
was
seated
behind
a
writing-desk
a
small
man
with
a
pleasant
clean-shaven
mobile
face
and
long
hair
shot
with
grey
brushed
back
from
his
forehead
he
looked
me
up
and
down
with
a
very
shrewd
penetrating
glance
holding
the
card
which
the
footman
had
given
him
in
his
right
hand
then
he
smiled
pleasantly
and
i
felt
that
externally
at
any
rate
i
possessed
the
qualifications
which
he
desired
â€œyou
have
come
in
answer
to
my
advertisement
dr
hamiltonâ€
he
asked
â€œyes
sirâ€
â€œdo
you
fulfil
the
conditions
which
are
there
laid
downâ€
â€œi
believe
that
i
doâ€
â€œyou
are
a
powerful
man
or
so
i
should
judge
from
your
appearanceâ€
â€œi
think
that
i
am
fairly
strongâ€
â€œand
resoluteâ€
â€œi
believe
soâ€
â€œhave
you
ever
known
what
it
was
to
be
exposed
to
imminent
dangerâ€
â€œno
i
donâ€™t
know
that
i
ever
haveâ€
â€œbut
you
think
you
would
be
prompt
and
cool
at
such
a
timeâ€
â€œi
hope
soâ€
â€œwell
i
believe
that
you
would
i
have
the
more
confidence
in
you
because
you
do
not
pretend
to
be
certain
as
to
what
you
would
do
in
a
position
that
was
new
to
you
my
impression
is
that
so
far
as
personal
qualities
go
you
are
the
very
man
of
whom
i
am
in
search
that
being
settled
we
may
pass
on
to
the
next
pointâ€
â€œwhich
isâ€
â€œto
talk
to
me
about
beetlesâ€
i
looked
across
to
see
if
he
was
joking
but
on
the
contrary
he
was
leaning
eagerly
forward
across
his
desk
and
there
was
an
expression
of
something
like
anxiety
in
his
eyes
â€œi
am
afraid
that
you
do
not
know
about
beetlesâ€
he
cried
â€œon
the
contrary
sir
it
is
the
one
scientific
subject
about
which
i
feel
that
i
really
do
know
somethingâ€
â€œi
am
overjoyed
to
hear
it
please
talk
to
me
about
beetlesâ€
i
talked
i
do
not
profess
to
have
said
anything
original
upon
the
subject
but
i
gave
a
short
sketch
of
the
characteristics
of
the
beetle
and
ran
over
the
more
common
species
with
some
allusions
to
the
specimens
in
my
own
little
collection
and
to
the
article
upon
â€œburying
beetlesâ€
which
i
had
contributed
to
the
journal
of
entomological
science
â€œwhat
not
a
collectorâ€
cried
lord
linchmere
â€œyou
donâ€™t
mean
that
you
are
yourself
a
collectorâ€
his
eyes
danced
with
pleasure
at
the
thought
â€œyou
are
certainly
the
very
man
in
london
for
my
purpose
i
thought
that
among
five
millions
of
people
there
must
be
such
a
man
but
the
difficulty
is
to
lay
oneâ€™s
hands
upon
him
i
have
been
extraordinarily
fortunate
in
finding
youâ€
he
rang
a
gong
upon
the
table
and
the
footman
entered
â€œask
lady
rossiter
to
have
the
goodness
to
step
this
wayâ€
said
his
lordship
and
a
few
moments
later
the
lady
was
ushered
into
the
room
she
was
a
small
middle-aged
woman
very
like
lord
linchmere
in
appearance
with
the
same
quick
alert
features
and
grey-black
hair
the
expression
of
anxiety
however
which
i
had
observed
upon
his
face
was
very
much
more
marked
upon
hers
some
great
grief
seemed
to
have
cast
its
shadow
over
her
features
as
lord
linchmere
presented
me
she
turned
her
face
full
upon
me
and
i
was
shocked
to
observe
a
half-healed
scar
extending
for
two
inches
over
her
right
eyebrow
it
was
partly
concealed
by
plaster
but
none
the
less
i
could
see
that
it
had
been
a
serious
wound
and
not
long
inflicted
â€œdr
hamilton
is
the
very
man
for
our
purpose
evelynâ€
said
lord
linchmere
â€œhe
is
actually
a
collector
of
beetles
and
he
has
written
articles
upon
the
subjectâ€
â€œreallyâ€
said
lady
rossiter
â€œthen
you
must
have
heard
of
my
husband
every
one
who
knows
anything
about
beetles
must
have
heard
of
sir
thomas
rossiterâ€
for
the
first
time
a
thin
little
ray
of
light
began
to
break
into
the
obscure
business
here
at
last
was
a
connection
between
these
people
and
beetles
sir
thomas
rossiterâ€”he
was
the
greatest
authority
upon
the
subject
in
the
world
he
had
made
it
his
life-long
study
and
had
written
a
most
exhaustive
work
upon
it
i
hastened
to
assure
her
that
i
had
read
and
appreciated
it
â€œhave
you
met
my
husbandâ€
she
asked
â€œno
i
have
notâ€
â€œbut
you
shallâ€
said
lord
linchmere
with
decision
the
lady
was
standing
beside
the
desk
and
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
it
was
obvious
to
me
as
i
saw
their
faces
together
that
they
were
brother
and
sister
â€œare
you
really
prepared
for
this
charles
it
is
noble
of
you
but
you
fill
me
with
fearsâ€
her
voice
quavered
with
apprehension
and
he
appeared
to
me
to
be
equally
moved
though
he
was
making
strong
efforts
to
conceal
his
agitation
â€œyes
yes
dear
it
is
all
settled
it
is
all
decided
in
fact
there
is
no
other
possible
way
that
i
can
seeâ€
â€œthere
is
one
obvious
wayâ€
â€œno
no
evelyn
i
shall
never
abandon
youâ€”never
it
will
come
rightâ€”depend
upon
it
it
will
come
right
and
surely
it
looks
like
the
interference
of
providence
that
so
perfect
an
instrument
should
be
put
into
our
handsâ€
my
position
was
embarrassing
for
i
felt
that
for
the
instant
they
had
forgotten
my
presence
but
lord
linchmere
came
back
suddenly
to
me
and
to
my
engagement
â€œthe
business
for
which
i
want
you
dr
hamilton
is
that
you
should
put
yourself
absolutely
at
my
disposal
i
wish
you
to
come
for
a
short
journey
with
me
to
remain
always
at
my
side
and
to
promise
to
do
without
question
whatever
i
may
ask
you
however
unreasonable
it
may
appear
to
you
to
beâ€
â€œthat
is
a
good
deal
to
askâ€
said
i
â€œunfortunately
i
cannot
put
it
more
plainly
for
i
do
not
myself
know
what
turn
matters
may
take
you
may
be
sure
however
that
you
will
not
be
asked
to
do
anything
which
your
conscience
does
not
approve
and
i
promise
you
that
when
all
is
over
you
will
be
proud
to
have
been
concerned
in
so
good
a
workâ€
â€œif
it
ends
happilyâ€
said
the
lady
â€œexactly
if
it
ends
happilyâ€
his
lordship
repeated
â€œand
termsâ€
i
asked
â€œtwenty
pounds
a
dayâ€
i
was
amazed
at
the
sum
and
must
have
showed
my
surprise
upon
my
features
â€œit
is
a
rare
combination
of
qualities
as
must
have
struck
you
when
you
first
read
the
advertisementâ€
said
lord
linchmere
â€œsuch
varied
gifts
may
well
command
a
high
return
and
i
do
not
conceal
from
you
that
your
duties
might
be
arduous
or
even
dangerous
besides
it
is
possible
that
one
or
two
days
may
bring
the
matter
to
an
endâ€
â€œplease
godâ€
sighed
his
sister
â€œso
now
dr
hamilton
may
i
rely
upon
your
aidâ€
â€œmost
undoubtedlyâ€
said
i
â€œyou
have
only
to
tell
me
what
my
duties
areâ€
â€œyour
first
duty
will
be
to
return
to
your
home
you
will
pack
up
whatever
you
may
need
for
a
short
visit
to
the
country
we
start
together
from
paddington
station
at
340
this
afternoonâ€
â€œdo
we
go
farâ€
â€œas
far
as
pangbourne
meet
me
at
the
bookstall
at
330
i
shall
have
the
tickets
good-bye
dr
hamilton
and
by
the
way
there
are
two
things
which
i
should
be
very
glad
if
you
would
bring
with
you
in
case
you
have
them
one
is
your
case
for
collecting
beetles
and
the
other
is
a
stick
and
the
thicker
and
heavier
the
betterâ€





you
may
imagine
that
i
had
plenty
to
think
of
from
the
time
that
i
left
brook
street
until
i
set
out
to
meet
lord
linchmere
at
paddington
the
whole
fantastic
business
kept
arranging
and
re-arranging
itself
in
kaleidoscopic
forms
inside
my
brain
until
i
had
thought
out
a
dozen
explanations
each
of
them
more
grotesquely
improbable
than
the
last
and
yet
i
felt
that
the
truth
must
be
something
grotesquely
improbable
also
at
last
i
gave
up
all
attempts
at
finding
a
solution
and
contented
myself
with
exactly
carrying
out
the
instructions
which
i
had
received
with
a
hand
valise
specimen-case
and
a
loaded
cane
i
was
waiting
at
the
paddington
bookstall
when
lord
linchmere
arrived
he
was
an
even
smaller
man
than
i
had
thoughtâ€”frail
and
peaky
with
a
manner
which
was
more
nervous
than
it
had
been
in
the
morning
he
wore
a
long
thick
travelling
ulster
and
i
observed
that
he
carried
a
heavy
blackthorn
cudgel
in
his
hand
â€œi
have
the
ticketsâ€
said
he
leading
the
way
up
the
platform
â€œthis
is
our
train
i
have
engaged
a
carriage
for
i
am
particularly
anxious
to
impress
one
or
two
things
upon
you
while
we
travel
downâ€
and
yet
all
that
he
had
to
impress
upon
me
might
have
been
said
in
a
sentence
for
it
was
that
i
was
to
remember
that
i
was
there
as
a
protection
to
himself
and
that
i
was
not
on
any
consideration
to
leave
him
for
an
instant
this
he
repeated
again
and
again
as
our
journey
drew
to
a
close
with
an
insistence
which
showed
that
his
nerves
were
thoroughly
shaken
â€œyesâ€
he
said
at
last
in
answer
to
my
looks
rather
than
to
my
words
â€œi
am
nervous
dr
hamilton
i
have
always
been
a
timid
man
and
my
timidity
depends
upon
my
frail
physical
health
but
my
soul
is
firm
and
i
can
bring
myself
up
to
face
a
danger
which
a
less
nervous
man
might
shrink
from
what
i
am
doing
now
is
done
from
no
compulsion
but
entirely
from
a
sense
of
duty
and
yet
it
is
beyond
doubt
a
desperate
risk
if
things
should
go
wrong
i
will
have
some
claims
to
the
title
of
martyrâ€
this
eternal
reading
of
riddles
was
too
much
for
me
i
felt
that
i
must
put
a
term
to
it
â€œi
think
it
would
be
very
much
better
sir
if
you
were
to
trust
me
entirelyâ€
said
i
â€œit
is
impossible
for
me
to
act
effectively
when
i
do
not
know
what
are
the
objects
which
we
have
in
view
or
even
where
we
are
goingâ€
â€œoh
as
to
where
we
are
going
there
need
be
no
mystery
about
thatâ€
said
he
â€œwe
are
going
to
delamere
court
the
residence
of
sir
thomas
rossiter
with
whose
work
you
are
so
conversant
as
to
the
exact
object
of
our
visit
i
do
not
know
that
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
anything
would
be
gained
dr
hamilton
by
my
taking
you
into
my
complete
confidence
i
may
tell
you
that
we
are
actingâ€”i
say
â€˜weâ€™
because
my
sister
lady
rossiter
takes
the
same
view
as
myselfâ€”with
the
one
object
of
preventing
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
family
scandal
that
being
so
you
can
understand
that
i
am
loth
to
give
any
explanations
which
are
not
absolutely
necessary
it
would
be
a
different
matter
dr
hamilton
if
i
were
asking
your
advice
as
matters
stand
it
is
only
your
active
help
which
i
need
and
i
will
indicate
to
you
from
time
to
time
how
you
can
best
give
itâ€
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
and
a
poor
man
can
put
up
with
a
good
deal
for
twenty
pounds
a
day
but
i
felt
none
the
less
that
lord
linchmere
was
acting
rather
scurvily
towards
me
he
wished
to
convert
me
into
a
passive
tool
like
the
blackthorn
in
his
hand
with
his
sensitive
disposition
i
could
imagine
however
that
scandal
would
be
abhorrent
to
him
and
i
realized
that
he
would
not
take
me
into
his
confidence
until
no
other
course
was
open
to
him
i
must
trust
to
my
own
eyes
and
ears
to
solve
the
mystery
but
i
had
every
confidence
that
i
should
not
trust
to
them
in
vain
delamere
court

a
good
five
miles
from
pangbourne
station
and
we
drove
for
that
distance
in
an
open
fly
lord
linchmere
sat
in
deep
thought
during
the
time
and
he
never
opened
his
mouth
until
we
were
close
to
our
destination
when
he
did
speak
it
was
to
give
me
a
piece
of
information
which
surprised
me
â€œperhaps
you
are
not
awareâ€
said
he
â€œthat
i
am
a
medical
man
like
yourselfâ€
â€œno
sir
i
did
not
know
itâ€
â€œyes
i
qualified
in
my
younger
days
when
there
were
several
lives
between
me
and
the
peerage
i
have
not
had
occasion
to
practise
but
i
have
found
it
a
useful
education
all
the
same
i
never
regretted
the
years
which
i
devoted
to
medical
study
these
are
the
gates
of
delamere
courtâ€
we
had
come
to
two
high
pillars
crowned
with
heraldic
monsters
which
flanked
the
opening
of
a
winding
avenue
over
the
laurel
bushes
and
rhododendrons
i
could
see
a
long
many-gabled
mansion
girdled
with
ivy
and
toned
to
the
warm
cheery
mellow
glow
of
old
brick-work
my
eyes
were
still
fixed
in
admiration
upon
this
delightful
house
when
my
companion
plucked
nervously
at
my
sleeve
â€œhereâ€™s
sir
thomasâ€
he
whispered
â€œplease
talk
beetle
all
you
canâ€
a
tall
thin
figure
curiously
angular
and
bony
had
emerged
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
of
laurels
in
his
hand
he
held
a
spud
and
he
wore
gauntleted
gardenerâ€™s
gloves
a
broad-brimmed
grey
hat
cast
his
face
into
shadow
but
it
struck
me
as
exceedingly
austere
with
an
ill-nourished
beard
and
harsh
irregular
features
the
fly
pulled
up
and
lord
linchmere
sprang
out
â€œmy
dear
thomas
how
are
youâ€
said
he
heartily
but
the
heartiness
was
by
no
means
reciprocal
the
owner
of
the
grounds
glared
at
me
over
his
brother-in-lawâ€™s
shoulder
and
i
caught
broken
scraps
of
sentencesâ€”â€œwell-known
wishes

hatred
of
strangers

unjustifiable
intrusion

perfectly
inexcusableâ€
then
there
was
a
muttered
explanation
and
the
two
of
them
came
over
together
to
the
side
of
the
fly
â€œlet
me
present
you
to
sir
thomas
rossiter
dr
hamiltonâ€
said
lord
linchmere
â€œyou
will
find
that
you
have
a
strong
community
of
tastesâ€
i
bowed
sir
thomas
stood
very
stiffly
looking
at
me
severely
from
under
the
broad
brim
of
his
hat
â€œlord
linchmere
tells
me
that
you
know
something
about
beetlesâ€
said
he
â€œwhat
do
you
know
about
beetlesâ€
â€œi
know
what
i
have
learned
from
your
work
upon
the
coleoptera
sir
thomasâ€
i
answered
â€œgive
me
the
names
of
the
better-known
species
of
the
british
scarabã¦iâ€
said
he
i
had
not
expected
an
examination
but
fortunately
i
was
ready
for
one
my
answers
seemed
to
please
him
for
his
stern
features
relaxed
â€œyou
appear
to
have
read
my
book
with
some
profit
sirâ€
said
he
â€œit
is
a
rare
thing
for
me
to
meet
any
one
who
takes
an
intelligent
interest
in
such
matters
people
can
find
time
for
such
trivialities
as
sport
or
society
and
yet
the
beetles
are
overlooked
i
can
assure
you
that
the
greater
part
of
the
idiots
in
this
part
of
the
country
are
unaware
that
i
have
ever
written
a
book
at
allâ€”i
the
first
man
who
ever
described
the
true
function
of
the
elytra
i
am
glad
to
see
you
sir
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
can
show
you
some
specimens
which
will
interest
youâ€
he
stepped
into
the
fly
and
drove
up
with
us
to
the
house
expounding
to
me
as
we
went
some
recent
researches
which
he
had
made
into
the
anatomy
of
the
lady-bird
i
have
said
that
sir
thomas
rossiter
wore
a
large
hat
drawn
down
over
his
brows
as
he
entered
the
hall
he
uncovered
himself
and
i
was
at
once
aware
of
a
singular
characteristic
which
the
hat
had
concealed
his
forehead
which
was
naturally
high
and
higher
still
on
account
of
receding
hair
was
in
a
continual
state
of
movement
some
nervous
weakness
kept
the
muscles
in
a
constant
spasm
which
sometimes
produced
a
mere
twitching
and
sometimes
a
curious
rotary
movement
unlike
anything
which
i
had
ever
seen
before
it
was
strikingly
visible
as
he
turned
towards
us
after
entering
the
study
and
seemed
the
more
singular
from
the
contrast
with
the
hard
steady
grey
eyes
which
looked
out
from
underneath
those
palpitating
brows
â€œi
am
sorryâ€
said
he
â€œthat
lady
rossiter
is
not
here
to
help
me
to
welcome
you
by
the
way
charles
did
evelyn
say
anything
about
the
date
of
her
returnâ€
â€œshe
wished
to
stay
in
town
for
a
few
more
daysâ€
said
lord
linchmere
â€œyou
know
how
ladiesâ€™
social
duties
accumulate
if
they
have
been
for
some
time
in
the
country
my
sister
has
many
old
friends
in
london
at
presentâ€
â€œwell
she
is
her
own
mistress
and
i
should
not
wish
to
alter
her
plans
but
i
shall
be
glad
when
i
see
her
again
it
is
very
lonely
here
without
her
companyâ€
â€œi
was
afraid
that
you
might
find
it
so
and
that
was
partly
why
i
ran
down
my
young
friend
dr
hamilton
is
so
much
interested
in
the
subject
which
you
have
made
your
own
that
i
thought
you
would
not
mind
his
accompanying
meâ€
â€œi
lead
a
retired
life
dr
hamilton
and
my
aversion
to
strangers
grows
upon
meâ€
said
our
host
â€œi
have
sometimes
thought
that
my
nerves
are
not
so
good
as
they
were
my
travels
in
search
of
beetles
in
my
younger
days
took
me
into
many
malarious
and
unhealthy
places
but
a
brother
coleopterist
like
yourself
is
always
a
welcome
guest
and
i
shall
be
delighted
if
you
will
look
over
my
collection
which
i
think
that
i
may
without
exaggeration
describe
as
the
best
in
europeâ€
and
so
no
doubt
it
was
he
had
a
huge
oaken
cabinet
arranged
in
shallow
drawers
and
here
neatly
ticketed
and
classified
were
beetles
from
every
corner
of
the
earth
black
brown
blue
green
and
mottled
every
now
and
then
as
he
swept
his
hand
over
the
lines
and
lines
of
impaled
insects
he
would
catch
up
some
rare
specimen
and
handling
it
with
as
much
delicacy
and
reverence
as
if
it
were
a
precious
relic
he
would
hold
forth
upon
its
peculiarities
and
the
circumstances
under
which
it
came
into
his
possession
it
was
evidently
an
unusual
thing
for
him
to
meet
with
a
sympathetic
listener
and
he
talked
and
talked
until
the
spring
evening
had
deepened
into
night
and
the
gong
announced
that
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
all
the
time
lord
linchmere
said
nothing
but
he
stood
at
his
brother-in-lawâ€™s
elbow
and
i
caught
him
continually
shooting
curious
little
questioning
glances
into
his
face
and
his
own
features
expressed
some
strong
emotion
apprehension
sympathy
expectation
i
seemed
to
read
them
all
i
was
sure
that
lord
linchmere
was
fearing
something
and
awaiting
something
but
what
that
something
might
be
i
could
not
imagine
the
evening
passed
quietly
but
pleasantly
and
i
should
have
been
entirely
at
my
ease
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
continual
sense
of
tension
upon
the
part
of
lord
linchmere
as
to
our
host
i
found
that
he
improved
upon
acquaintance
he
spoke
constantly
with
affection
of
his
absent
wife
and
also
of
his
little
son
who
had
recently
been
sent
to
school
the
house
he
said
was
not
the
same
without
them
if
it
were
not
for
his
scientific
studies
he
did
not
know
how
he
could
get
through
the
days
after
dinner
we
smoked
for
some
time
in
the
billiard-room
and
finally
went
early
to
bed
and
then
it
was
that
for
the
first
time
the
suspicion
that
lord
linchmere
was
a
lunatic
crossed
my
mind
he
followed
me
into
my
bedroom
when
our
host
had
retired
â€œdoctorâ€
said
he
speaking
in
a
low
hurried
voice
â€œyou
must
come
with
me
you
must
spend
the
night
in
my
bedroomâ€
â€œwhat
do
you
meanâ€
â€œi
prefer
not
to
explain
but
this
is
part
of
your
duties
my
room
is
close
by
and
you
can
return
to
your
own
before
the
servant
calls
you
in
the
morningâ€
â€œbut
whyâ€
i
asked
â€œbecause
i
am
nervous
of
being
aloneâ€
said
he
â€œthatâ€™s
the
reason
since
you
must
have
a
reasonâ€
it
seemed
rank
lunacy
but
the
argument
of
those
twenty
pounds
would
overcome
many
objections
i
followed
him
to
his
room
â€œwellâ€
said
i
â€œthereâ€™s
only
room
for
one
in
that
bedâ€
â€œonly
one
shall
occupy
itâ€
said
he
â€œand
the
otherâ€
â€œmust
remain
on
watchâ€
â€œwhyâ€
said
i
â€œone
would
think
you
expected
to
be
attackedâ€
â€œperhaps
i
doâ€
â€œin
that
case
why
not
lock
your
doorâ€
â€œperhaps
i
want
to
be
attackedâ€
it
looked
more
and
more
like
lunacy
however
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
submit
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
sat
down
in
the
arm-chair
beside
the
empty
fireplace
â€œi
am
to
remain
on
watch
thenâ€
said
i
ruefully
â€œwe
will
divide
the
night
if
you
will
watch
until
two
i
will
watch
the
remainderâ€
â€œvery
goodâ€
â€œcall
me
at
two
oâ€™clock
thenâ€
â€œi
will
do
soâ€
â€œkeep
your
ears
open
and
if
you
hear
any
sounds
wake
me
instantlyâ€”instantly
you
hearâ€
â€œyou
can
rely
upon
itâ€
i
tried
to
look
as
solemn
as
he
did
â€œand
for
godâ€™s
sake
donâ€™t
go
to
sleepâ€
said
he
and
so
taking
off
only
his
coat
he
threw
the
coverlet
over
him
and
settled
down
for
the
night
it
was
a
melancholy
vigil
and
made
more
so
by
my
own
sense
of
its
folly
supposing
that
by
any
chance
lord
linchmere
had
cause
to
suspect
that
he
was
subject
to
danger
in
the
house
of
sir
thomas
rossiter
why
on
earth
could
he
not
lock
his
door
and
so
protect
himself
his
own
answer
that
he
might
wish
to
be
attacked
was
absurd
why
should
he
possibly
wish
to
be
attacked
and
who
would
wish
to
attack
him
clearly
lord
linchmere
was
suffering
from
some
singular
delusion
and
the
result
was
that
on
an
imbecile
pretext
i
was
to
be
deprived
of
my
nightâ€™s
rest
still
however
absurd
i
was
determined
to
carry
out
his
injunctions
to
the
letter
as
long
as
i
was
in
his
employment
i
sat
therefore
beside
the
empty
fireplace
and
listened
to
a
sonorous
chiming
clock
somewhere
down
the
passage
which
gurgled
and
struck
every
quarter
of
an
hour
it
was
an
endless
vigil
save
for
that
single
clock
an
absolute
silence
reigned
throughout
the
great
house
a
small
lamp
stood
on
the
table
at
my
elbow
throwing
a
circle
of
light
round
my
chair
but
leaving
the
corners
of
the
room
draped
in
shadow
on
the
bed
lord
linchmere
was
breathing
peacefully
i
envied
him
his
quiet
sleep
and
again
and
again
my
own
eyelids
drooped
but
every
time
my
sense
of
duty
came
to
my
help
and
i
sat
up
rubbing
my
eyes
and
pinching
myself
with
a
determination
to
see
my
irrational
watch
to
an
end
and
i
did
so
from
down
the
passage
came
the
chimes
of
two
oâ€™clock
and
i
laid
my
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
sleeper
instantly
he
was
sitting
up
with
an
expression
of
the
keenest
interest
upon
his
face
â€œyou
have
heard
somethingâ€
â€œno
sir
it
is
two
oâ€™clockâ€
â€œvery
good
i
will
watch
you
can
go
to
sleepâ€
i
lay
down
under
the
coverlet
as
he
had
done
and
was
soon
unconscious
my
last
recollection
was
of
that
circle
of
lamplight
and
of
the
small
hunched-up
figure
and
strained
anxious
face
of
lord
linchmere
in
the
centre
of
it
how
long
i
slept
i
do
not
know
but
i
was
suddenly
aroused
by
a
sharp
tug
at
my
sleeve
the
room
was
in
darkness
but
a
hot
smell
of
oil
told
me
that
the
lamp
had
only
that
instant
been
extinguished
â€œquick
quickâ€
said
lord
linchmereâ€™s
voice
in
my
ear
i
sprang
out
of
bed
he
still
dragging
at
my
arm
â€œover
hereâ€
he
whispered
and
pulled
me
into
a
corner
of
the
room
â€œhush
listenâ€
in
the
silence
of
the
night
i
could
distinctly
hear
that
someone
was
coming
down
the
corridor
it
was
a
stealthy
step
faint
and
intermittent
as
of
a
man
who
paused
cautiously
after
every
stride
sometimes
for
half
a
minute
there
was
no
sound
and
then
came
the
shuffle
and
creak
which
told
of
a
fresh
advance
my
companion
was
trembling
with
excitement
his
hand
which
still
held
my
sleeve
twitched
like
a
branch
in
the
wind
â€œwhat
is
itâ€
i
whispered
â€œitâ€™s
heâ€
â€œsir
thomasâ€
â€œyesâ€
â€œwhat
does
he
wantâ€
â€œhush
do
nothing
until
i
tell
youâ€
i
was
conscious
now
that
someone
was
trying
the
door
there
was
the
faintest
little
rattle
from
the
handle
and
then
i
dimly
saw
a
thin
slit
of
subdued
light
there
was
a
lamp
burning
somewhere
far
down
the
passage
and
it
just
sufficed
to
make
the
outside
visible
from
the
darkness
of
our
room
the
greyish
slit
grew
broader
and
broader
very
gradually
very
gently
and
then
outlined
against
it
i
saw
the
dark
figure
of
a
man
he
was
squat
and
crouching
with
the
silhouette
of
a
bulky
and
misshapen
dwarf
slowly
the
door
swung
open
with
this
ominous
shape
framed
in
the
centre
of
it
and
then
in
an
instant
the
crouching
figure
shot
up
there
was
a
tiger
spring
across
the
room
and
thud
thud
thud
came
three
tremendous
blows
from
some
heavy
object
upon
the
bed
i
was
so
paralyzed
with
amazement
that
i
stood
motionless
and
staring
until
i
was
aroused
by
a
yell
for
help
from
my
companion
the
open
door
shed
enough
light
for
me
to
see
the
outline
of
things
and
there
was
little
lord
linchmere
with
his
arms
round
the
neck
of
his
brother-in-law
holding
bravely
on
to
him
like
a
game
bull-terrier
with
its
teeth
into
a
gaunt
deerhound
the
tall
bony
man
dashed
himself
about
writhing
round
and
round
to
get
a
grip
upon
his
assailant
but
the
other
clutching
on
from
behind
still
kept
his
hold
though
his
shrill
frightened
cries
showed
how
unequal
he
felt
the
contest
to
be
i
sprang
to
the
rescue
and
the
two
of
us
managed
to
throw
sir
thomas
to
the
ground
though
he
made
his
teeth
meet
in
my
shoulder
with
all
my
youth
and
weight
and
strength
it
was
a
desperate
struggle
before
we
could
master
his
frenzied
struggles
but
at
last
we
secured
his
arms
with
the
waist-cord
of
the
dressing-gown
which
he
was
wearing
i
was
holding
his
legs
while
lord
linchmere
was
endeavouring
to
relight
the
lamp
when
there
came
the
pattering
of
many
feet
in
the
passage
and
the
butler
and
two
footmen
who
had
been
alarmed
by
the
cries
rushed
into
the
room
with
their
aid
we
had
no
further
difficulty
in
securing
our
prisoner
who
lay
foaming
and
glaring
upon
the
ground
one
glance
at
his
face
was
enough
to
prove
that
he
was
a
dangerous
maniac
while
the
short
heavy
hammer
which
lay
beside
the
bed
showed
how
murderous
had
been
his
intentions
â€œdo
not
use
any
violenceâ€
said
lord
linchmere
as
we
raised
the
struggling
man
to
his
feet
â€œhe
will
have
a
period
of
stupor
after
this
excitement
i
believe
that
it
is
coming
on
alreadyâ€
as
he
spoke
the
convulsions
became
less
violent
and
the
madmanâ€™s
head
fell
forward
upon
his
breast
as
if
he
were
overcome
by
sleep
we
led
him
down
the
passage
and
stretched
him
upon
his
own
bed
where
he
lay
unconscious
breathing
heavily
â€œtwo
of
you
will
watch
himâ€
said
lord
linchmere
â€œand
now
dr
hamilton
if
you
will
return
with
me
to
my
room
i
will
give
you
the
explanation
which
my
horror
of
scandal
has
perhaps
caused
me
to
delay
too
long
come
what
may
you
will
never
have
cause
to
regret
your
share
in
this
nightâ€™s
work
â€œthe
case
may
be
made
clear
in
a
very
few
wordsâ€
he
continued
when
we
were
alone
â€œmy
poor
brother-in-law
is
one
of
the
best
fellows
upon
earth
a
loving
husband
and
an
estimable
father
but
he
comes
from
a
stock
which
is
deeply
tainted
with
insanity
he
has
more
than
once
had
homicidal
outbreaks
which
are
the
more
painful
because
his
inclination
is
always
to
attack
the
very
person
to
whom
he
is
most
attached
his
son
was
sent
away
to
school
to
avoid
this
danger
and
then
came
an
attempt
upon
my
sister
his
wife
from
which
she
escaped
with
injuries
that
you
may
have
observed
when
you
met
her
in
london
you
understand
that
he
knows
nothing
of
the
matter
when
he
is
in
his
sound
senses
and
would
ridicule
the
suggestion
that
he
could
under
any
circumstances
injure
those
whom
he
loves
so
dearly
it
is
often
as
you
know
a
characteristic
of
such
maladies
that
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
convince
the
man
who
suffers
from
them
of
their
existence
â€œour
great
object
was
of
course
to
get
him
under
restraint
before
he
could
stain
his
hands
with
blood
but
the
matter
was
full
of
difficulty
he
is
a
recluse
in
his
habits
and
would
not
see
any
medical
man
besides
it
was
necessary
for
our
purpose
that
the
medical
man
should
convince
himself
of
his
insanity
and
he
is
sane
as
you
or
i
save
on
these
very
rare
occasions
but
fortunately
before
he
has
these
attacks
he
always
shows
certain
premonitory
symptoms
which
are
providential
danger-signals
warning
us
to
be
upon
our
guard
the
chief
of
these
is
that
nervous
contortion
of
the
forehead
which
you
must
have
observed
this
is
a
phenomenon
which
always
appears
from
three
to
four
days
before
his
attacks
of
frenzy
the
moment
it
showed
itself
his
wife
came
into
town
on
some
pretext
and
took
refuge
in
my
house
in
brook
street
â€œit
remained
for
me
to
convince
a
medical
man
of
sir
thomasâ€™s
insanity
without
which
it
was
impossible
to
put
him
where
he
could
do
no
harm
the
first
problem
was
how
to
get
a
medical
man
into
his
house
i
bethought
me
of
his
interest
in
beetles
and
his
love
for
any
one
who
shared
his
tastes
i
advertised
therefore
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
in
you
the
very
man
i
wanted
a
stout
companion
was
necessary
for
i
knew
that
the
lunacy
could
only
be
proved
by
a
murderous
assault
and
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
that
assault
would
be
made
upon
myself
since
he
had
the
warmest
regard
for
me
in
his
moments
of
sanity
i
think
your
intelligence
will
supply
all
the
rest
i
did
not
know
that
the
attack
would
come
by
night
but
i
thought
it
very
probable
for
the
crises
of
such
cases
usually
do
occur
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
i
am
a
very
nervous
man
myself
but
i
saw
no
other
way
in
which
i
could
remove
this
terrible
danger
from
my
sisterâ€™s
life
i
need
not
ask
you
whether
you
are
willing
to
sign
the
lunacy
papersâ€
â€œundoubtedly
but
two
signatures
are
necessaryâ€
â€œyou
forget
that
i
am
myself
a
holder
of
a
medical
degree
i
have
the
papers
on
a
side-table
here
so
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
sign
them
now
we
can
have
the
patient
removed
in
the
morningâ€





so
that
was
my
visit
to
sir
thomas
rossiter
the
famous
beetle-hunter
and
that
was
also
my
first
step
upon
the
ladder
of
success
for
lady
rossiter
and
lord
linchmere
have
proved
to
be
staunch
friends
and
they
have
never
forgotten
my
association
with
them
in
the
time
of
their
need
sir
thomas
is
out
and
said
to
be
cured
but
i
still
think
that
if
i
spent
another
night
at
delamere
court
i
should
be
inclined
to
lock
my
door
upon
the
inside
the
man
with
the
watches
there
are
many
who
will
still
bear
in
mind
the
singular
circumstances
which
under
the
heading
of
the
rugby
mystery
filled
many
columns
of
the
daily
press
in
the
spring
of
the
year
1892
coming
as
it
did
at
a
period
of
exceptional
dulness
it
attracted
perhaps
rather
more
attention
than
it
deserved
but
it
offered
to
the
public
that
mixture
of
the
whimsical
and
the
tragic
which
is
most
stimulating
to
the
popular
imagination
interest
drooped
however
when
after
weeks
of
fruitless
investigation
it
was
found
that
no
final
explanation
of
the
facts
was
forthcoming
and
the
tragedy
seemed
from
that
time
to
the
present
to
have
finally
taken
its
place
in
the
dark
catalogue
of
inexplicable
and
unexpiated
crimes
a
recent
communication
the
authenticity
of
which
appears
to
be
above
question
has
however
thrown
some
new
and
clear
light
upon
the
matter
before
laying
it
before
the
public
it
would
be
as
well
perhaps
that
i
should
refresh
their
memories
as
to
the
singular
facts
upon
which
this
commentary
is
founded
these
facts
were
briefly
as
followsâ€”
at
five
oâ€™clock
on
the
evening
of
the
18th
of
march
in
the
year
already
mentioned
a
train
left
euston
station
for
manchester
it
was
a
rainy
squally
day
which
grew
wilder
as
it
progressed
so
it
was
by
no
means
the
weather
in
which
any
one
would
travel
who
was
not
driven
to
do
so
by
necessity
the
train
however
is
a
favourite
one
among
manchester
business
men
who
are
returning
from
town
for
it
does
the
journey
in
four
hours
and
twenty
minutes
with
only
three
stoppages
upon
the
way
in
spite
of
the
inclement
evening
it
was
therefore
fairly
well
filled
upon
the
occasion
of
which
i
speak
the
guard
of
the
train
was
a
tried
servant
of
the
companyâ€”a
man
who
had
worked
for
twenty-two
years
without
blemish
or
complaint
his
name
was
john
palmer
the
station
clock
was
upon
the
stroke
of
five
and
the
guard
was
about
to
give
the
customary
signal
to
the
engine-driver
when
he
observed
two
belated
passengers
hurrying
down
the
platform
the
one
was
an
exceptionally
tall
man
dressed
in
a
long
black
overcoat
with
astrakhan
collar
and
cuffs
i
have
already
said
that
the
evening
was
an
inclement
one
and
the
tall
traveller
had
the
high
warm
collar
turned
up
to
protect
his
throat
against
the
bitter
march
wind
he
appeared
as
far
as
the
guard
could
judge
by
so
hurried
an
inspection
to
be
a
man
between
fifty
and
sixty
years
of
age
who
had
retained
a
good
deal
of
the
vigour
and
activity
of
his
youth
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
brown
leather
gladstone
bag
his
companion
was
a
lady
tall
and
erect
walking
with
a
vigorous
step
which
outpaced
the
gentleman
beside
her
she
wore
a
long
fawn-coloured
dust-cloak
a
black
close-fitting
toque
and
a
dark
veil
which
concealed
the
greater
part
of
her
face
the
two
might
very
well
have
passed
as
father
and
daughter
they
walked
swiftly
down
the
line
of
carriages
glancing
in
at
the
windows
until
the
guard
john
palmer
overtook
them
â€œnow
then
sir
look
sharp
the
train
is
goingâ€
said
he
â€œfirst-classâ€
the
man
answered
the
guard
turned
the
handle
of
the
nearest
door
in
the
carriage
which
he
had
opened
there
sat
a
small
man
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
his
appearance
seems
to
have
impressed
itself
upon
the
guardâ€™s
memory
for
he
was
prepared
afterwards
to
describe
or
to
identify
him
he
was
a
man
of
thirty-four
or
thirty-five
years
of
age
dressed
in
some
grey
material
sharp-nosed
alert
with
a
ruddy
weather-beaten
face
and
a
small
closely
cropped
black
beard
he
glanced
up
as
the
door
was
opened
the
tall
man
paused
with
his
foot
upon
the
step
â€œthis
is
a
smoking
compartment
the
lady
dislikes
smokeâ€
said
he
looking
round
at
the
guard
â€œall
right
here
you
are
sirâ€
said
john
palmer
he
slammed
the
door
of
the
smoking
carriage
opened
that
of
the
next
one
which
was
empty
and
thrust
the
two
travellers
in
at
the
same
moment
he
sounded
his
whistle
and
the
wheels
of
the
train
began
to
move
the
man
with
the
cigar
was
at
the
window
of
his
carriage
and
said
something
to
the
guard
as
he
rolled
past
him
but
the
words
were
lost
in
the
bustle
of
the
departure
palmer
stepped
into
the
guardâ€™s
van
as
it
came
up
to
him
and
thought
no
more
of
the
incident
twelve
minutes
after
its
departure
the
train
reached
willesden
junction
where
it
stopped
for
a
very
short
interval
an
examination
of
the
tickets
has
made
it
certain
that
no
one
either
joined
or
left
it
at
this
time
and
no
passenger
was
seen
to
alight
upon
the
platform
at
514
the
journey
to
manchester
was
resumed
and
rugby
was
reached
at
650
the
express
being
five
minutes
late
at
rugby
the
attention
of
the
station
officials
was
drawn
to
the
fact
that
the
door
of
one
of
the
first-class
carriages
was
open
an
examination
of
that
compartment
and
of
its
neighbour
disclosed
a
remarkable
state
of
affairs
the
smoking
carriage
in
which
the
short
red-faced
man
with
the
black
beard
had
been
seen
was
now
empty
save
for
a
half-smoked
cigar
there
was
no
trace
whatever
of
its
recent
occupant
the
door
of
this
carriage
was
fastened
in
the
next
compartment
to
which
attention
had
been
originally
drawn
there
was
no
sign
either
of
the
gentleman
with
the
astrakhan
collar
or
of
the
young
lady
who
accompanied
him
all
three
passengers
had
disappeared
on
the
other
hand
there
was
found
upon
the
floor
of
this
carriageâ€”the
one
in
which
the
tall
traveller
and
the
lady
had
beenâ€”a
young
man
fashionably
dressed
and
of
elegant
appearance
he
lay
with
his
knees
drawn
up
and
his
head
resting
against
the
further
door
an
elbow
upon
either
seat
a
bullet
had
penetrated
his
heart
and
his
death
must
have
been
instantaneous
no
one
had
seen
such
a
man
enter
the
train
and
no
railway
ticket
was
found
in
his
pocket
neither
were
there
any
markings
upon
his
linen
nor
papers
nor
personal
property
which
might
help
to
identify
him
who
he
was
whence
he
had
come
and
how
he
had
met
his
end
were
each
as
great
a
mystery
as
what
had
occurred
to
the
three
people
who
had
started
an
hour
and
a
half
before
from
willesden
in
those
two
compartments
i
have
said
that
there
was
no
personal
property
which
might
help
to
identify
him
but
it
is
true
that
there
was
one
peculiarity
about
this
unknown
young
man
which
was
much
commented
upon
at
the
time
in
his
pockets
were
found
no
fewer
than
six
valuable
gold
watches
three
in
the
various
pockets
of
his
waistcoat
one
in
his
ticket-pocket
one
in
his
breast-pocket
and
one
small
one
set
in
a
leather
strap
and
fastened
round
his
left
wrist
the
obvious
explanation
that
the
man
was
a
pickpocket
and
that
this
was
his
plunder
was
discounted
by
the
fact
that
all
six
were
of
american
make
and
of
a
type
which
is
rare
in
england
three
of
them
bore
the
mark
of
the
rochester
watchmaking
company
one
was
by
mason
of
elmira
one
was
unmarked
and
the
small
one
which
was
highly
jewelled
and
ornamented
was
from
tiffany
of
new
york
the
other
contents
of
his
pocket
consisted
of
an
ivory
knife
with
a
corkscrew
by
rodgers
of
sheffield
a
small
circular
mirror
one
inch
in
diameter
a
re-admission
slip
to
the
lyceum
theatre
a
silver
box
full
of
vesta
matches
and
a
brown
leather
cigar-case
containing
two
cherootsâ€”also
two
pounds
fourteen
shillings
in
money
it
was
clear
then
that
whatever
motives
may
have
led
to
his
death
robbery
was
not
among
them
as
already
mentioned
there
were
no
markings
upon
the
manâ€™s
linen
which
appeared
to
be
new
and
no
tailorâ€™s
name
upon
his
coat
in
appearance
he
was
young
short
smooth-cheeked
and
delicately
featured
one
of
his
front
teeth
was
conspicuously
stopped
with
gold
on
the
discovery
of
the
tragedy
an
examination
was
instantly
made
of
the
tickets
of
all
passengers
and
the
number
of
the
passengers
themselves
was
counted
it
was
found
that
only
three
tickets
were
unaccounted
for
corresponding
to
the
three
travellers
who
were
missing
the
express
was
then
allowed
to
proceed
but
a
new
guard
was
sent
with
it
and
john
palmer
was
detained
as
a
witness
at
rugby
the
carriage
which
included
the
two
compartments
in
question
was
uncoupled
and
side-tracked
then
on
the
arrival
of
inspector
vane
of
scotland
yard
and
of
mr
henderson
a
detective
in
the
service
of
the
railway
company
an
exhaustive
inquiry
was
made
into
all
the
circumstances
that
crime
had
been
committed
was
certain
the
bullet
which
appeared
to
have
come
from
a
small
pistol
or
revolver
had
been
fired
from
some
little
distance
as
there
was
no
scorching
of
the
clothes
no
weapon
was
found
in
the
compartment
which
finally
disposed
of
the
theory
of
suicide
nor
was
there
any
sign
of
the
brown
leather
bag
which
the
guard
had
seen
in
the
hand
of
the
tall
gentleman
a
ladyâ€™s
parasol
was
found
upon
the
rack
but
no
other
trace
was
to
be
seen
of
the
travellers
in
either
of
the
sections
apart
from
the
crime
the
question
of
how
or
why
three
passengers
one
of
them
a
lady
could
get
out
of
the
train
and
one
other
get
in
during
the
unbroken
run
between
willesden
and
rugby
was
one
which
excited
the
utmost
curiosity
among
the
general
public
and
gave
rise
to
much
speculation
in
the
london
press
john
palmer
the
guard
was
able
at
the
inquest
to
give
some
evidence
which
threw
a
little
light
upon
the
matter
there
was
a
spot
between
tring
and
cheddington
according
to
his
statement
where
on
account
of
some
repairs
to
the
line
the
train
had
for
a
few
minutes
slowed
down
to
a
pace
not
exceeding
eight
or
ten
miles
an
hour
at
that
place
it
might
be
possible
for
a
man
or
even
for
an
exceptionally
active
woman
to
have
left
the
train
without
serious
injury
it
was
true
that
a
gang
of
platelayers
was
there
and
that
they
had
seen
nothing
but
it
was
their
custom
to
stand
in
the
middle
between
the
metals
and
the
open
carriage
door
was
upon
the
far
side
so
that
it
was
conceivable
that
someone
might
have
alighted
unseen
as
the
darkness
would
by
that
time
be
drawing
in
a
steep
embankment
would
instantly
screen
anyone
who
sprang
out
from
the
observation
of
the
navvies
the
guard
also
deposed
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
movement
upon
the
platform
at
willesden
junction
and
that
though
it
was
certain
that
no
one
had
either
joined
or
left
the
train
there
it
was
still
quite
possible
that
some
of
the
passengers
might
have
changed
unseen
from
one
compartment
to
another
it
was
by
no
means
uncommon
for
a
gentleman
to
finish
his
cigar
in
a
smoking
carriage
and
then
to
change
to
a
clearer
atmosphere
supposing
that
the
man
with
the
black
beard
had
done
so
at
willesden
and
the
half-smoked
cigar
upon
the
floor
seemed
to
favour
the
supposition
he
would
naturally
go
into
the
nearest
section
which
would
bring
him
into
the
company
of
the
two
other
actors
in
this
drama
thus
the
first
stage
of
the
affair
might
be
surmised
without
any
great
breach
of
probability
but
what
the
second
stage
had
been
or
how
the
final
one
had
been
arrived
at
neither
the
guard
nor
the
experienced
detective
officers
could
suggest
a
careful
examination
of
the
line
between
willesden
and
rugby
resulted
in
one
discovery
which
might
or
might
not
have
a
bearing
upon
the
tragedy
near
tring
at
the
very
place
where
the
train
slowed
down
there
was
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
embankment
a
small
pocket
testament
very
shabby
and
worn
it
was
printed
by
the
bible
society
of
london
and
bore
an
inscription
â€œfrom
john
to
alice
jan
13th
1856â€
upon
the
fly-leaf
underneath
was
written
â€œjames
july
4th
1859â€
and
beneath
that
again
â€œedward
nov
1st
1869â€
all
the
entries
being
in
the
same
handwriting
this
was
the
only
clue
if
it
could
be
called
a
clue
which
the
police
obtained
and
the
coronerâ€™s
verdict
of
â€œmurder
by
a
person
or
persons
unknownâ€
was
the
unsatisfactory
ending
of
a
singular
case
advertisement
rewards
and
inquiries
proved
equally
fruitless
and
nothing
could
be
found
which
was
solid
enough
to
form
the
basis
for
a
profitable
investigation
it
would
be
a
mistake
however
to
suppose
that
no
theories
were
formed
to
account
for
the
facts
on
the
contrary
the
press
both
in
england
and
in
america
teemed
with
suggestions
and
suppositions
most
of
which
were
obviously
absurd
the
fact
that
the
watches
were
of
american
make
and
some
peculiarities
in
connection
with
the
gold
stopping
of
his
front
tooth
appeared
to
indicate
that
the
deceased
was
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
though
his
linen
clothes
and
boots
were
undoubtedly
of
british
manufacture
it
was
surmised
by
some
that
he
was
concealed
under
the
seat
and
that
being
discovered
he
was
for
some
reason
possibly
because
he
had
overheard
their
guilty
secrets
put
to
death
by
his
fellow-passengers
when
coupled
with
generalities
as
to
the
ferocity
and
cunning
of
anarchical
and
other
secret
societies
this
theory
sounded
as
plausible
as
any
the
fact
that
he
should
be
without
a
ticket
would
be
consistent
with
the
idea
of
concealment
and
it
was
well
known
that
women
played
a
prominent
part
in
the
nihilistic
propaganda
on
the
other
hand
it
was
clear
from
the
guardâ€™s
statement
that
the
man
must
have
been
hidden
there
before
the
others
arrived
and
how
unlikely
the
coincidence
that
conspirators
should
stray
exactly
into
the
very
compartment
in
which
a
spy
was
already
concealed
besides
this
explanation
ignored
the
man
in
the
smoking
carriage
and
gave
no
reason
at
all
for
his
simultaneous
disappearance
the
police
had
little
difficulty
in
showing
that
such
a
theory
would
not
cover
the
facts
but
they
were
unprepared
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
advance
any
alternative
explanation
there
was
a
letter
in
the
daily
gazette
over
the
signature
of
a
well-known
criminal
investigator
which
gave
rise
to
considerable
discussion
at
the
time
he
had
formed
a
hypothesis
which
had
at
least
ingenuity
to
recommend
it
and
i
cannot
do
better
than
append
it
in
his
own
words
â€œwhatever
may
be
the
truthâ€
said
he
â€œit
must
depend
upon
some
bizarre
and
rare
combination
of
events
so
we
need
have
no
hesitation
in
postulating
such
events
in
our
explanation
in
the
absence
of
data
we
must
abandon
the
analytic
or
scientific
method
of
investigation
and
must
approach
it
in
the
synthetic
fashion
in
a
word
instead
of
taking
known
events
and
deducing
from
them
what
has
occurred
we
must
build
up
a
fanciful
explanation
if
it
will
only
be
consistent
with
known
events
we
can
then
test
this
explanation
by
any
fresh
facts
which
may
arise
if
they
all
fit
into
their
places
the
probability
is
that
we
are
upon
the
right
track
and
with
each
fresh
fact
this
probability
increases
in
a
geometrical
progression
until
the
evidence
becomes
final
and
convincing
â€œnow
there
is
one
most
remarkable
and
suggestive
fact
which
has
not
met
with
the
attention
which
it
deserves
there
is
a
local
train
running
through
harrow
and
kingâ€™s
langley
which
is
timed
in
such
a
way
that
the
express
must
have
overtaken
it
at
or
about
the
period
when
it
eased
down
its
speed
to
eight
miles
an
hour
on
account
of
the
repairs
of
the
line
the
two
trains
would
at
that
time
be
travelling
in
the
same
direction
at
a
similar
rate
of
speed
and
upon
parallel
lines
it
is
within
everyoneâ€™s
experience
how
under
such
circumstances
the
occupant
of
each
carriage
can
see
very
plainly
the
passengers
in
the
other
carriages
opposite
to
him
the
lamps
of
the
express
had
been
lit
at
willesden
so
that
each
compartment
was
brightly
illuminated
and
most
visible
to
an
observer
from
outside
â€œnow
the
sequence
of
events
as
i
reconstruct
them
would
be
after
this
fashion
this
young
man
with
the
abnormal
number
of
watches
was
alone
in
the
carriage
of
the
slow
train
his
ticket
with
his
papers
and
gloves
and
other
things
was
we
will
suppose
on
the
seat
beside
him
he
was
probably
an
american
and
also
probably
a
man
of
weak
intellect
the
excessive
wearing
of
jewellery
is
an
early
symptom
in
some
forms
of
mania
â€œas
he
sat
watching
the
carriages
of
the
express
which
were
on
account
of
the
state
of
the
line
going
at
the
same
pace
as
himself
he
suddenly
saw
some
people
in
it
whom
he
knew
we
will
suppose
for
the
sake
of
our
theory
that
these
people
were
a
woman
whom
he
loved
and
a
man
whom
he
hatedâ€”and
who
in
return
hated
him
the
young
man
was
excitable
and
impulsive
he
opened
the
door
of
his
carriage
stepped
from
the
footboard
of
the
local
train
to
the
footboard
of
the
express
opened
the
other
door
and
made
his
way
into
the
presence
of
these
two
people
the
feat
on
the
supposition
that
the
trains
were
going
at
the
same
pace
is
by
no
means
so
perilous
as
it
might
appear
â€œhaving
now
got
our
young
man
without
his
ticket
into
the
carriage
in
which
the
elder
man
and
the
young
woman
are
travelling
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
that
a
violent
scene
ensued
it
is
possible
that
the
pair
were
also
americans
which
is
the
more
probable
as
the
man
carried
a
weaponâ€”an
unusual
thing
in
england
if
our
supposition
of
incipient
mania
is
correct
the
young
man
is
likely
to
have
assaulted
the
other
as
the
upshot
of
the
quarrel
the
elder
man
shot
the
intruder
and
then
made
his
escape
from
the
carriage
taking
the
young
lady
with
him
we
will
suppose
that
all
this
happened
very
rapidly
and
that
the
train
was
still
going
at
so
slow
a
pace
that
it
was
not
difficult
for
them
to
leave
it
a
woman
might
leave
a
train
going
at
eight
miles
an
hour
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
know
that
this
woman
did
do
so
â€œand
now
we
have
to
fit
in
the
man
in
the
smoking
carriage
presuming
that
we
have
up
to
this
point
reconstructed
the
tragedy
correctly
we
shall
find
nothing
in
this
other
man
to
cause
us
to
reconsider
our
conclusions
according
to
my
theory
this
man
saw
the
young
fellow
cross
from
one
train
to
the
other
saw
him
open
the
door
heard
the
pistol-shot
saw
the
two
fugitives
spring
out
on
to
the
line
realized
that
murder
had
been
done
and
sprang
out
himself
in
pursuit
why
he
has
never
been
heard
of
sinceâ€”whether
he
met
his
own
death
in
the
pursuit
or
whether
as
is
more
likely
he
was
made
to
realize
that
it
was
not
a
case
for
his
interferenceâ€”is
a
detail
which
we
have
at
present
no
means
of
explaining
i
acknowledge
that
there
are
some
difficulties
in
the
way
at
first
sight
it
might
seem
improbable
that
at
such
a
moment
a
murderer
would
burden
himself
in
his
flight
with
a
brown
leather
bag
my
answer
is
that
he
was
well
aware
that
if
the
bag
were
found
his
identity
would
be
established
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
take
it
with
him
my
theory
stands
or
falls
upon
one
point
and
i
call
upon
the
railway
company
to
make
strict
inquiry
as
to
whether
a
ticket
was
found
unclaimed
in
the
local
train
through
harrow
and
kingâ€™s
langley
upon
the
18th
of
march
if
such
a
ticket
were
found
my
case
is
proved
if
not
my
theory
may
still
be
the
correct
one
for
it
is
conceivable
either
that
he
travelled
without
a
ticket
or
that
his
ticket
was
lostâ€
to
this
elaborate
and
plausible
hypothesis
the
answer
of
the
police
and
of
the
company
was
first
that
no
such
ticket
was
found
secondly
that
the
slow
train
would
never
run
parallel
to
the
express
and
thirdly
that
the
local
train
had
been
stationary
in
kingâ€™s
langley
station
when
the
express
going
at
fifty
miles
an
hour
had
flashed
past
it
so
perished
the
only
satisfying
explanation
and
five
years
have
elapsed
without
supplying
a
new
one
now
at
last
there
comes
a
statement
which
covers
all
the
facts
and
which
must
be
regarded
as
authentic
it
took
the
shape
of
a
letter
dated
from
new
york
and
addressed
to
the
same
criminal
investigator
whose
theory
i
have
quoted
it
is
given
here
in
extenso
with
the
exception
of
the
two
opening
paragraphs
which
are
personal
in
their
natureâ€”
â€œyouâ€™ll
excuse
me
if
iâ€™m
not
very
free
with
names
thereâ€™s
less
reason
now
than
there
was
five
years
ago
when
mother
was
still
living
but
for
all
that
i
had
rather
cover
up
our
tracks
all
i
can
but
i
owe
you
an
explanation
for
if
your
idea
of
it
was
wrong
it
was
a
mighty
ingenious
one
all
the
same
iâ€™ll
have
to
go
back
a
little
so
as
you
may
understand
all
about
it
â€œmy
people
came
from
bucks
england
and
emigrated
to
the
states
in
the
early
fifties
they
settled
in
rochester
in
the
state
of
new
york
where
my
father
ran
a
large
dry
goods
store
there
were
only
two
sons
myself
james
and
my
brother
edward
i
was
ten
years
older
than
my
brother
and
after
my
father
died
i
sort
of
took
the
place
of
a
father
to
him
as
an
elder
brother
would
he
was
a
bright
spirited
boy
and
just
one
of
the
most
beautiful
creatures
that
ever
lived
but
there
was
always
a
soft
spot
in
him
and
it
was
like
mould
in
cheese
for
it
spread
and
spread
and
nothing
that
you
could
do
would
stop
it
mother
saw
it
just
as
clearly
as
i
did
but
she
went
on
spoiling
him
all
the
same
for
he
had
such
a
way
with
him
that
you
could
refuse
him
nothing
i
did
all
i
could
to
hold
him
in
and
he
hated
me
for
my
pains
â€œat
last
he
fairly
got
his
head
and
nothing
that
we
could
do
would
stop
him
he
got
off
into
new
york
and
went
rapidly
from
bad
to
worse
at
first
he
was
only
fast
and
then
he
was
criminal
and
then
at
the
end
of
a
year
or
two
he
was
one
of
the
most
notorious
young
crooks
in
the
city
he
had
formed
a
friendship
with
sparrow
maccoy
who
was
at
the
head
of
his
profession
as
a
bunco-steerer
green
goods-man
and
general
rascal
they
took
to
card-sharping
and
frequented
some
of
the
best
hotels
in
new
york
my
brother
was
an
excellent
actor
he
might
have
made
an
honest
name
for
himself
if
he
had
chosen
and
he
would
take
the
parts
of
a
young
englishman
of
title
of
a
simple
lad
from
the
west
or
of
a
college
undergraduate
whichever
suited
sparrow
maccoyâ€™s
purpose
and
then
one
day
he
dressed
himself
as
a
girl
and
he
carried
it
off
so
well
and
made
himself
such
a
valuable
decoy
that
it
was
their
favourite
game
afterwards
they
had
made
it
right
with
tammany
and
with
the
police
so
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
could
ever
stop
them
for
those
were
in
the
days
before
the
lexow
commission
and
if
you
only
had
a
pull
you
could
do
pretty
nearly
everything
you
wanted
â€œand
nothing
would
have
stopped
them
if
they
had
only
stuck
to
cards
and
new
york
but
they
must
needs
come
up
rochester
way
and
forge
a
name
upon
a
check
it
was
my
brother
that
did
it
though
everyone
knew
that
it
was
under
the
influence
of
sparrow
maccoy
i
bought
up
that
check
and
a
pretty
sum
it
cost
me
then
i
went
to
my
brother
laid
it
before
him
on
the
table
and
swore
to
him
that
i
would
prosecute
if
he
did
not
clear
out
of
the
country
at
first
he
simply
laughed
i
could
not
prosecute
he
said
without
breaking
our
motherâ€™s
heart
and
he
knew
that
i
would
not
do
that
i
made
him
understand
however
that
our
motherâ€™s
heart
was
being
broken
in
any
case
and
that
i
had
set
firm
on
the
point
that
i
would
rather
see
him
in
a
rochester
gaol
than
in
a
new
york
hotel
so
at
last
he
gave
in
and
he
made
me
a
solemn
promise
that
he
would
see
sparrow
maccoy
no
more
that
he
would
go
to
europe
and
that
he
would
turn
his
hand
to
any
honest
trade
that
i
helped
him
to
get
i
took
him
down
right
away
to
an
old
family
friend
joe
willson
who
is
an
exporter
of
american
watches
and
clocks
and
i
got
him
to
give
edward
an
agency
in
london
with
a
small
salary
and
a
15
per
cent
commission
on
all
business
his
manner
and
appearance
were
so
good
that
he
won
the
old
man
over
at
once
and
within
a
week
he
was
sent
off
to
london
with
a
case
full
of
samples
â€œit
seemed
to
me
that
this
business
of
the
check
had
really
given
my
brother
a
fright
and
that
there
was
some
chance
of
his
settling
down
into
an
honest
line
of
life
my
mother
had
spoken
with
him
and
what
she
said
had
touched
him
for
she
had
always
been
the
best
of
mothers
to
him
and
he
had
been
the
great
sorrow
of
her
life
but
i
knew
that
this
man
sparrow
maccoy
had
a
great
influence
over
edward
and
my
chance
of
keeping
the
lad
straight
lay
in
breaking
the
connection
between
them
i
had
a
friend
in
the
new
york
detective
force
and
through
him
i
kept
a
watch
upon
maccoy
when
within
a
fortnight
of
my
brotherâ€™s
sailing
i
heard
that
maccoy
had
taken
a
berth
in
the
etruria
i
was
as
certain
as
if
he
had
told
me
that
he
was
going
over
to
england
for
the
purpose
of
coaxing
edward
back
again
into
the
ways
that
he
had
left
in
an
instant
i
had
resolved
to
go
also
and
to
put
my
influence
against
maccoyâ€™s
i
knew
it
was
a
losing
fight
but
i
thought
and
my
mother
thought
that
it
was
my
duty
we
passed
the
last
night
together
in
prayer
for
my
success
and
she
gave
me
her
own
testament
that
my
father
had
given
her
on
the
day
of
their
marriage
in
the
old
country
so
that
i
might
always
wear
it
next
my
heart
â€œi
was
a
fellow-traveller
on
the
steamship
with
sparrow
maccoy
and
at
least
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
spoiling
his
little
game
for
the
voyage
the
very
first
night
i
went
into
the
smoking-room
and
found
him
at
the
head
of
a
card
table
with
half-a-dozen
young
fellows
who
were
carrying
their
full
purses
and
their
empty
skulls
over
to
europe
he
was
settling
down
for
his
harvest
and
a
rich
one
it
would
have
been
but
i
soon
changed
all
that
â€œâ€˜gentlemenâ€™
said
i
â€˜are
you
aware
whom
you
are
playing
withâ€™
â€œâ€˜whatâ€™s
that
to
you
you
mind
your
own
businessâ€™
said
he
with
an
oath
â€œâ€˜who
is
it
anywayâ€™
asked
one
of
the
dudes
â€œâ€˜heâ€™s
sparrow
maccoy
the
most
notorious
cardsharper
in
the
statesâ€™
â€œup
he
jumped
with
a
bottle
in
his
hand
but
he
remembered
that
he
was
under
the
flag
of
the
effete
old
country
where
law
and
order
run
and
tammany
has
no
pull
gaol
and
the
gallows
wait
for
violence
and
murder
and
thereâ€™s
no
slipping
out
by
the
back
door
on
board
an
ocean
liner
â€œâ€˜prove
your
words
youâ€”â€”â€™
said
he
â€œâ€˜i
willâ€™
said
i
â€˜if
you
will
turn
up
your
right
shirt-sleeve
to
the
shoulder
i
will
either
prove
my
words
or
i
will
eat
themâ€™
â€œhe
turned
white
and
said
not
a
word
you
see
i
knew
something
of
his
ways
and
i
was
aware
that
part
of
the
mechanism
which
he
and
all
such
sharpers
use
consists
of
an
elastic
down
the
arm
with
a
clip
just
above
the
wrist
it
is
by
means
of
this
clip
that
they
withdraw
from
their
hands
the
cards
which
they
do
not
want
while
they
substitute
other
cards
from
another
hiding-place
i
reckoned
on
it
being
there
and
it
was
he
cursed
me
slunk
out
of
the
saloon
and
was
hardly
seen
again
during
the
voyage
for
once
at
any
rate
i
got
level
with
mister
sparrow
maccoy
â€œbut
he
soon
had
his
revenge
upon
me
for
when
it
came
to
influencing
my
brother
he
outweighed
me
every
time
edward
had
kept
himself
straight
in
london
for
the
first
few
weeks
and
had
done
some
business
with
his
american
watches
until
this
villain
came
across
his
path
once
more
i
did
my
best
but
the
best
was
little
enough
the
next
thing
i
heard
there
had
been
a
scandal
at
one
of
the
northumberland
avenue
hotels
a
traveller
had
been
fleeced
of
a
large
sum
by
two
confederate
card-sharpers
and
the
matter
was
in
the
hands
of
scotland
yard
the
first
i
learned
of
it
was
in
the
evening
paper
and
i
was
at
once
certain
that
my
brother
and
maccoy
were
back
at
their
old
games
i
hurried
at
once
to
edwardâ€™s
lodgings
they
told
me
that
he
and
a
tall
gentleman
whom
i
recognized
as
maccoy
had
gone
off
together
and
that
he
had
left
the
lodgings
and
taken
his
things
with
him
the
landlady
had
heard
them
give
several
directions
to
the
cabman
ending
with
euston
station
and
she
had
accidentally
overheard
the
tall
gentleman
saying
something
about
manchester
she
believed
that
that
was
their
destination
â€œa
glance
at
the
time-table
showed
me
that
the
most
likely
train
was
at
five
though
there
was
another
at
435
which
they
might
have
caught
i
had
only
time
to
get
the
later
one
but
found
no
sign
of
them
either
at
the
depã´t
or
in
the
train
they
must
have
gone
on
by
the
earlier
one
so
i
determined
to
follow
them
to
manchester
and
search
for
them
in
the
hotels
there
one
last
appeal
to
my
brother
by
all
that
he
owed
to
my
mother
might
even
now
be
the
salvation
of
him
my
nerves
were
overstrung
and
i
lit
a
cigar
to
steady
them
at
that
moment
just
as
the
train
was
moving
off
the
door
of
my
compartment
was
flung
open
and
there
were
maccoy
and
my
brother
on
the
platform
â€œthey
were
both
disguised
and
with
good
reason
for
they
knew
that
the
london
police
were
after
them
maccoy
had
a
great
astrakhan
collar
drawn
up
so
that
only
his
eyes
and
nose
were
showing
my
brother
was
dressed
like
a
woman
with
a
black
veil
half
down
his
face
but
of
course
it
did
not
deceive
me
for
an
instant
nor
would
it
have
done
so
even
if
i
had
not
known
that
he
had
often
used
such
a
dress
before
i
started
up
and
as
i
did
so
maccoy
recognized
me
he
said
something
the
conductor
slammed
the
door
and
they
were
shown
into
the
next
compartment
i
tried
to
stop
the
train
so
as
to
follow
them
but
the
wheels
were
already
moving
and
it
was
too
late
â€œwhen
we
stopped
at
willesden
i
instantly
changed
my
carriage
it
appears
that
i
was
not
seen
to
do
so
which
is
not
surprising
as
the
station
was
crowded
with
people
maccoy
of
course
was
expecting
me
and
he
had
spent
the
time
between
euston
and
willesden
in
saying
all
he
could
to
harden
my
brotherâ€™s
heart
and
set
him
against
me
that
is
what
i
fancy
for
i
had
never
found
him
so
impossible
to
soften
or
to
move
i
tried
this
way
and
i
tried
that
i
pictured
his
future
in
an
english
gaol
i
described
the
sorrow
of
his
mother
when
i
came
back
with
the
news
i
said
everything
to
touch
his
heart
but
all
to
no
purpose
he
sat
there
with
a
fixed
sneer
upon
his
handsome
face
while
every
now
and
then
sparrow
maccoy
would
throw
in
a
taunt
at
me
or
some
word
of
encouragement
to
hold
my
brother
to
his
resolutions
â€œâ€˜why
donâ€™t
you
run
a
sunday-schoolâ€™
he
would
say
to
me
and
then
in
the
same
breath
â€˜he
thinks
you
have
no
will
of
your
own
he
thinks
you
are
just
the
baby
brother
and
that
he
can
lead
you
where
he
likes
heâ€™s
only
just
finding
out
that
you
are
a
man
as
well
as
heâ€™
â€œit
was
those
words
of
his
which
set
me
talking
bitterly
we
had
left
willesden
you
understand
for
all
this
took
some
time
my
temper
got
the
better
of
me
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
let
my
brother
see
the
rough
side
of
me
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
had
i
done
so
earlier
and
more
often
â€œâ€˜a
manâ€™
said
i
â€˜well
iâ€™m
glad
to
have
your
friendâ€™s
assurance
of
it
for
no
one
would
suspect
it
to
see
you
like
a
boarding-school
missy
i
donâ€™t
suppose
in
all
this
country
there
is
a
more
contemptible-looking
creature
than
you
are
as
you
sit
there
with
that
dolly
pinafore
upon
youâ€™
he
coloured
up
at
that
for
he
was
a
vain
man
and
he
winced
from
ridicule
â€œâ€˜itâ€™s
only
a
dust-cloakâ€™
said
he
and
he
slipped
it
off
â€˜one
has
to
throw
the
coppers
off
oneâ€™s
scent
and
i
had
no
other
way
to
do
itâ€™
he
took
his
toque
off
with
the
veil
attached
and
he
put
both
it
and
the
cloak
into
his
brown
bag
â€˜anyway
i
donâ€™t
need
to
wear
it
until
the
conductor
comes
roundâ€™
said
he
â€œâ€˜nor
then
eitherâ€™
said
i
and
taking
the
bag
i
slung
it
with
all
my
force
out
of
the
window
â€˜nowâ€™
said
i
â€˜youâ€™ll
never
make
a
mary
jane
of
yourself
while
i
can
help
it
if
nothing
but
that
disguise
stands
between
you
and
a
gaol
then
to
gaol
you
shall
goâ€™
â€œthat
was
the
way
to
manage
him
i
felt
my
advantage
at
once
his
supple
nature
was
one
which
yielded
to
roughness
far
more
readily
than
to
entreaty
he
flushed
with
shame
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
maccoy
saw
my
advantage
also
and
was
determined
that
i
should
not
pursue
it
â€œâ€˜heâ€™s
my
pard
and
you
shall
not
bully
himâ€™
he
cried
â€œâ€˜heâ€™s
my
brother
and
you
shall
not
ruin
himâ€™
said
i
â€˜i
believe
a
spell
of
prison
is
the
very
best
way
of
keeping
you
apart
and
you
shall
have
it
or
it
will
be
no
fault
of
mineâ€™
â€œâ€˜oh
you
would
squeal
would
youâ€™
he
cried
and
in
an
instant
he
whipped
out
his
revolver
i
sprang
for
his
hand
but
saw
that
i
was
too
late
and
jumped
aside
at
the
same
instant
he
fired
and
the
bullet
which
would
have
struck
me
passed
through
the
heart
of
my
unfortunate
brother
â€œhe
dropped
without
a
groan
upon
the
floor
of
the
compartment
and
maccoy
and
i
equally
horrified
knelt
at
each
side
of
him
trying
to
bring
back
some
signs
of
life
maccoy
still
held
the
loaded
revolver
in
his
hand
but
his
anger
against
me
and
my
resentment
towards
him
had
both
for
the
moment
been
swallowed
up
in
this
sudden
tragedy
it
was
he
who
first
realized
the
situation
the
train
was
for
some
reason
going
very
slowly
at
the
moment
and
he
saw
his
opportunity
for
escape
in
an
instant
he
had
the
door
open
but
i
was
as
quick
as
he
and
jumping
upon
him
the
two
of
us
fell
off
the
footboard
and
rolled
in
each
otherâ€™s
arms
down
a
steep
embankment
at
the
bottom
i
struck
my
head
against
a
stone
and
i
remembered
nothing
more
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
lying
among
some
low
bushes
not
far
from
the
railroad
track
and
somebody
was
bathing
my
head
with
a
wet
handkerchief
it
was
sparrow
maccoy
â€œâ€˜i
guess
i
couldnâ€™t
leave
youâ€™
said
he
â€˜i
didnâ€™t
want
to
have
the
blood
of
two
of
you
on
my
hands
in
one
day
you
loved
your
brother
iâ€™ve
no
doubt
but
you
didnâ€™t
love
him
a
cent
more
than
i
loved
him
though
youâ€™ll
say
that
i
took
a
queer
way
to
show
it
anyhow
it
seems
a
mighty
empty
world
now
that
he
is
gone
and
i
donâ€™t
care
a
continental
whether
you
give
me
over
to
the
hangman
or
notâ€™
â€œhe
had
turned
his
ankle
in
the
fall
and
there
we
sat
he
with
his
useless
foot
and
i
with
my
throbbing
head
and
we
talked
and
talked
until
gradually
my
bitterness
began
to
soften
and
to
turn
into
something
like
sympathy
what
was
the
use
of
revenging
his
death
upon
a
man
who
was
as
much
stricken
by
that
death
as
i
was
and
then
as
my
wits
gradually
returned
i
began
to
realize
also
that
i
could
do
nothing
against
maccoy
which
would
not
recoil
upon
my
mother
and
myself
how
could
we
convict
him
without
a
full
account
of
my
brotherâ€™s
career
being
made
publicâ€”the
very
thing
which
of
all
others
we
wished
to
avoid
it
was
really
as
much
our
interest
as
his
to
cover
the
matter
up
and
from
being
an
avenger
of
crime
i
found
myself
changed
to
a
conspirator
against
justice
the
place
in
which
we
found
ourselves
was
one
of
those
pheasant
preserves
which
are
so
common
in
the
old
country
and
as
we
groped
our
way
through
it
i
found
myself
consulting
the
slayer
of
my
brother
as
to
how
far
it
would
be
possible
to
hush
it
up
â€œi
soon
realized
from
what
he
said
that
unless
there
were
some
papers
of
which
we
knew
nothing
in
my
brotherâ€™s
pockets
there
was
really
no
possible
means
by
which
the
police
could
identify
him
or
learn
how
he
had
got
there
his
ticket
was
in
maccoyâ€™s
pocket
and
so
was
the
ticket
for
some
baggage
which
they
had
left
at
the
depã´t
like
most
americans
he
had
found
it
cheaper
and
easier
to
buy
an
outfit
in
london
than
to
bring
one
from
new
york
so
that
all
his
linen
and
clothes
were
new
and
unmarked
the
bag
containing
the
dust
cloak
which
i
had
thrown
out
of
the
window
may
have
fallen
among
some
bramble
patch
where
it
is
still
concealed
or
may
have
been
carried
off
by
some
tramp
or
may
have
come
into
the
possession
of
the
police
who
kept
the
incident
to
themselves
anyhow
i
have
seen
nothing
about
it
in
the
london
papers
as
to
the
watches
they
were
a
selection
from
those
which
had
been
intrusted
to
him
for
business
purposes
it
may
have
been
for
the
same
business
purposes
that
he
was
taking
them
to
manchester
butâ€”well
itâ€™s
too
late
to
enter
into
that
â€œi
donâ€™t
blame
the
police
for
being
at
fault
i
donâ€™t
see
how
it
could
have
been
otherwise
there
was
just
one
little
clew
that
they
might
have
followed
up
but
it
was
a
small
one
i
mean
that
small
circular
mirror
which
was
found
in
my
brotherâ€™s
pocket
it
isnâ€™t
a
very
common
thing
for
a
young
man
to
carry
about
with
him
is
it
but
a
gambler
might
have
told
you
what
such
a
mirror
may
mean
to
a
cardsharper
if
you
sit
back
a
little
from
the
table
and
lay
the
mirror
face
upwards
upon
your
lap
you
can
see
as
you
deal
every
card
that
you
give
to
your
adversary
it
is
not
hard
to
say
whether
you
see
a
man
or
raise
him
when
you
know
his
cards
as
well
as
your
own
it
was
as
much
a
part
of
a
sharperâ€™s
outfit
as
the
elastic
clip
upon
sparrow
maccoyâ€™s
arm
taking
that
in
connection
with
the
recent
frauds
at
the
hotels
the
police
might
have
got
hold
of
one
end
of
the
string
â€œi
donâ€™t
think
there
is
much
more
for
me
to
explain
we
got
to
a
village
called
amersham
that
night
in
the
character
of
two
gentlemen
upon
a
walking
tour
and
afterwards
we
made
our
way
quietly
to
london
whence
maccoy
went
on
to
cairo
and
i
returned
to
new
york
my
mother
died
six
months
afterwards
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
to
the
day
of
her
death
she
never
knew
what
happened
she
was
always
under
the
delusion
that
edward
was
earning
an
honest
living
in
london
and
i
never
had
the
heart
to
tell
her
the
truth
he
never
wrote
but
then
he
never
did
write
at
any
time
so
that
made
no
difference
his
name
was
the
last
upon
her
lips
â€œthereâ€™s
just
one
other
thing
that
i
have
to
ask
you
sir
and
i
should
take
it
as
a
kind
return
for
all
this
explanation
if
you
could
do
it
for
me
you
remember
that
testament
that
was
picked
up
i
always
carried
it
in
my
inside
pocket
and
it
must
have
come
out
in
my
fall
i
value
it
very
highly
for
it
was
the
family
book
with
my
birth
and
my
brotherâ€™s
marked
by
my
father
in
the
beginning
of
it
i
wish
you
would
apply
at
the
proper
place
and
have
it
sent
to
me
it
can
be
of
no
possible
value
to
any
one
else
if
you
address
it
to
x
bassanoâ€™s
library
broadway
new
york
it
is
sure
to
come
to
handâ€
the
pot
of
caviare
it
was
the
fourth
day
of
the
siege
ammunition
and
provisions
were
both
nearing
an
end
when
the
boxer
insurrection
had
suddenly
flamed
up
and
roared
like
a
fire
in
dry
grass
across
northern
china
the
few
scattered
europeans
in
the
outlying
provinces
had
huddled
together
at
the
nearest
defensible
post
and
had
held
on
for
dear
life
until
rescue
cameâ€”or
until
it
did
not
in
the
latter
case
the
less
said
about
their
fate
the
better
in
the
former
they
came
back
into
the
world
of
men
with
that
upon
their
faces
which
told
that
they
had
looked
very
closely
upon
such
an
end
as
would
ever
haunt
their
dreams
ichau
was
only
fifty
miles
from
the
coast
and
there
was
a
european
squadron
in
the
gulf
of
liantong
therefore
the
absurd
little
garrison
consisting
of
native
christians
and
railway
men
with
a
german
officer
to
command
them
and
five
civilian
europeans
to
support
him
held
on
bravely
with
the
conviction
that
help
must
soon
come
sweeping
down
to
them
from
the
low
hills
to
eastward
the
sea
was
visible
from
those
hills
and
on
the
sea
were
their
armed
countrymen
surely
then
they
could
not
feel
deserted
with
brave
hearts
they
manned
the
loopholes
in
the
crumbling
brick
walls
outlining
the
tiny
european
quarter
and
they
fired
away
briskly
if
ineffectively
at
the
rapidly
advancing
sangars
of
the
boxers
it
was
certain
that
in
another
day
or
so
they
would
be
at
the
end
of
their
resources
but
then
it
was
equally
certain
that
in
another
day
or
so
they
must
be
relieved
it
might
be
a
little
sooner
or
it
might
be
a
little
later
but
there
was
no
one
who
ever
ventured
to
hint
that
the
relief
would
not
arrive
in
time
to
pluck
them
out
of
the
fire
up
to
tuesday
night
there
was
no
word
of
discouragement
it
was
true
that
on
the
wednesday
their
robust
faith
in
what
was
going
forward
behind
those
eastern
hills
had
weakened
a
little
the
grey
slopes
lay
bare
and
unresponsive
while
the
deadly
sangars
pushed
ever
nearer
so
near
that
the
dreadful
faces
which
shrieked
imprecations
at
them
from
time
to
time
over
the
top
could
be
seen
in
every
hideous
feature
there
was
not
so
much
of
that
now
since
young
ainslie
of
the
diplomatic
service
with
his
neat
little
303
sporting
rifle
had
settled
down
in
the
squat
church
tower
and
had
devoted
his
days
to
abating
the
nuisance
but
a
silent
sangar
is
an
even
more
impressive
thing
than
a
clamorous
one
and
steadily
irresistibly
inevitably
the
lines
of
brick
and
rubble
drew
closer
soon
they
would
be
so
near
that
one
rush
would
assuredly
carry
the
frantic
swordsmen
over
the
frail
entrenchment
it
all
seemed
very
black
upon
the
wednesday
evening
colonel
dresler
the
german
ex-infantry
soldier
went
about
with
an
imperturbable
face
but
a
heart
of
lead
ralston
of
the
railway
was
up
half
the
night
writing
farewell
letters
professor
mercer
the
old
entomologist
was
even
more
silent
and
grimly
thoughtful
than
ever
ainslie
had
lost
some
of
his
flippancy
on
the
whole
the
ladiesâ€”miss
sinclair
the
nurse
of
the
scotch
mission
mrs
patterson
and
her
pretty
daughter
jessie
were
the
most
composed
of
the
party
father
pierre
of
the
french
mission
was
also
unaffected
as
was
natural
to
one
who
regarded
martyrdom
as
a
glorious
crown
the
boxers
yelling
for
his
blood
beyond
the
walls
disturbed
him
less
than
his
forced
association
with
the
sturdy
scotch
presbyterian
presence
of
mr
patterson
with
whom
for
ten
years
he
had
wrangled
over
the
souls
of
the
natives
they
passed
each
other
now
in
the
corridors
as
dog
passes
cat
and
each
kept
a
watchful
eye
upon
the
other
lest
even
in
the
trenches
he
might
filch
some
sheep
from
the
rival
fold
whispering
heresy
in
his
ear
but
the
wednesday
night
passed
without
a
crisis
and
on
the
thursday
all
was
bright
once
more
it
was
ainslie
up
in
the
clock
tower
who
had
first
heard
the
distant
thud
of
a
gun
then
dresler
heard
it
and
within
half
an
hour
it
was
audible
to
allâ€”that
strong
iron
voice
calling
to
them
from
afar
and
bidding
them
to
be
of
good
cheer
since
help
was
coming
it
was
clear
that
the
landing
party
from
the
squadron
was
well
on
its
way
it
would
not
arrive
an
hour
too
soon
the
cartridges
were
nearly
finished
their
half-rations
of
food
would
soon
dwindle
to
an
even
more
pitiful
supply
but
what
need
to
worry
about
that
now
that
relief
was
assured
there
would
be
no
attack
that
day
as
most
of
the
boxers
could
be
seen
streaming
off
in
the
direction
of
the
distant
firing
and
the
long
lines
of
sangars
were
silent
and
deserted
they
were
all
able
therefore
to
assemble
at
the
lunch-table
a
merry
talkative
party
full
of
that
joy
of
living
which
sparkles
most
brightly
under
the
imminent
shadow
of
death
â€œthe
pot
of
caviareâ€
cried
ainslie
â€œcome
professor
out
with
the
pot
of
caviareâ€
â€œpotz-tausend
yesâ€
grunted
old
dresler
â€œit
is
certainly
time
that
we
had
that
famous
potâ€
the
ladies
joined
in
and
from
all
parts
of
the
long
ill-furnished
table
there
came
the
demand
for
caviare
it
was
a
strange
time
to
ask
for
such
a
delicacy
but
the
reason
is
soon
told
professor
mercer
the
old
californian
entomologist
had
received
a
jar
of
caviare
in
a
hamper
of
goods
from
san
francisco
arriving
a
day
or
two
before
the
outbreak
in
the
general
pooling
and
distribution
of
provisions
this
one
dainty
and
three
bottles
of
lachryma
christi
from
the
same
hamper
had
been
excepted
and
set
aside
by
common
consent
they
were
to
be
reserved
for
the
final
joyous
meal
when
the
end
of
their
peril
should
be
in
sight
even
as
they
sat
the
thud-thud
of
the
relieving
guns
came
to
their
earsâ€”more
luxurious
music
to
their
lunch
than
the
most
sybaritic
restaurant
of
london
could
have
supplied
before
evening
the
relief
would
certainly
be
there
why
then
should
their
stale
bread
not
be
glorified
by
the
treasured
caviare
but
the
professor
shook
his
gnarled
old
head
and
smiled
his
inscrutable
smile
â€œbetter
waitâ€
said
he
â€œwait
why
waitâ€
cried
the
company
â€œthey
have
still
far
to
comeâ€
he
answered
â€œthey
will
be
here
for
supper
at
the
latestâ€
said
ralston
of
the
railwayâ€”a
keen
birdlike
man
with
bright
eyes
and
long
projecting
nose
â€œthey
cannot
be
more
than
ten
miles
from
us
now
if
they
only
did
two
miles
an
hour
it
would
make
them
due
at
sevenâ€
â€œthere
is
a
battle
on
the
wayâ€
remarked
the
colonel
â€œyou
will
grant
two
hours
or
three
hours
for
the
battleâ€
â€œnot
half
an
hourâ€
cried
ainslie
â€œthey
will
walk
through
them
as
if
they
were
not
there
what
can
these
rascals
with
their
matchlocks
and
swords
do
against
modern
weaponsâ€
â€œit
depends
on
who
leads
the
column
of
reliefâ€
said
dresler
â€œif
they
are
fortunate
enough
to
have
a
german
officerâ€”â€”â€
â€œan
englishman
for
my
moneyâ€
cried
ralston
â€œthe
french
commodore
is
said
to
be
an
excellent
strategistâ€
remarked
father
pierre
â€œi
donâ€™t
see
that
it
matters
a
tossâ€
cried
the
exuberant
ainslie
â€œmr
mauser
and
mr
maxim
are
the
two
men
who
will
see
us
through
and
with
them
on
our
side
no
leader
can
go
wrong
i
tell
you
they
will
just
brush
them
aside
and
walk
through
them
so
now
professor
come
on
with
that
pot
of
caviareâ€
but
the
old
scientist
was
unconvinced
â€œwe
shall
reserve
it
for
supperâ€
said
he
â€œafter
allâ€
said
mr
patterson
in
his
slow
precise
scottish
intonation
â€œit
will
be
a
courtesy
to
our
guestsâ€”the
officers
of
the
reliefâ€”if
we
have
some
palatable
food
to
lay
before
them
iâ€™m
in
agreement
with
the
professor
that
we
reserve
the
caviare
for
supperâ€
the
argument
appealed
to
their
sense
of
hospitality
there
was
something
pleasantly
chivalrous
too
in
the
idea
of
keeping
their
one
little
delicacy
to
give
a
savour
to
the
meal
of
their
preservers
there
was
no
more
talk
of
the
caviare
â€œby
the
way
professorâ€
said
mr
patterson
â€œiâ€™ve
only
heard
to-day
that
this
is
the
second
time
that
you
have
been
besieged
in
this
way
iâ€™m
sure
we
should
all
be
very
interested
to
hear
some
details
of
your
previous
experienceâ€
the
old
manâ€™s
face
set
very
grimly
â€œi
was
in
sung-tong
in
south
china
in
â€˜eighty-nineâ€
said
he
â€œitâ€™s
a
very
extraordinary
coincidence
that
you
should
twice
have
been
in
such
a
perilous
situationâ€
said
the
missionary
â€œtell
us
how
you
were
relieved
at
sung-tongâ€
the
shadow
deepened
upon
the
weary
face
â€œwe
were
not
relievedâ€
said
he
â€œwhat
the
place
fellâ€
â€œyes
it
fellâ€
â€œand
you
came
through
aliveâ€
â€œi
am
a
doctor
as
well
as
an
entomologist
they
had
many
wounded
they
spared
meâ€
â€œand
the
restâ€
â€œassez
assezâ€
cried
the
little
french
priest
raising
his
hand
in
protest
he
had
been
twenty
years
in
china
the
professor
had
said
nothing
but
there
was
something
some
lurking
horror
in
his
dull
grey
eyes
which
had
turned
the
ladies
pale
â€œi
am
sorryâ€
said
the
missionary
â€œi
can
see
that
it
is
a
painful
subject
i
should
not
have
askedâ€
â€œnoâ€
the
professor
answered
slowly
â€œit
is
wiser
not
to
ask
it
is
better
not
to
speak
about
such
things
at
all
but
surely
those
guns
are
very
much
nearerâ€
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
after
a
silence
the
thud-thud
had
recommenced
with
a
lively
ripple
of
rifle-fire
playing
all
round
that
deep
bass
master-note
it
must
be
just
at
the
farther
side
of
the
nearest
hill
they
pushed
back
their
chairs
and
ran
out
to
the
ramparts
the
silent-footed
native
servants
came
in
and
cleared
the
scanty
remains
from
the
table
but
after
they
had
left
the
old
professor
sat
on
there
his
massive
grey-crowned
head
leaning
upon
his
hands
and
the
same
pensive
look
of
horror
in
his
eyes
some
ghosts
may
be
laid
for
years
but
when
they
do
rise
it
is
not
so
easy
to
drive
them
back
to
their
slumbers
the
guns
had
ceased
outside
but
he
had
not
observed
it
lost
as
he
was
in
the
one
supreme
and
terrible
memory
of
his
life
his
thoughts
were
interrupted
at
last
by
the
entrance
of
the
commandant
there
was
a
complacent
smile
upon
his
broad
german
face
â€œthe
kaiser
will
be
pleasedâ€
said
he
rubbing
his
hands
â€œyes
certainly
it
should
mean
a
decoration
â€˜defence
of
ichau
against
the
boxers
by
colonel
dresler
late
major
of
the
114th
hanoverian
infantry
splendid
resistance
of
small
garrison
against
overwhelming
oddsâ€™
it
will
certainly
appear
in
the
berlin
papersâ€
â€œthen
you
think
we
are
savedâ€
said
the
old
man
with
neither
emotion
nor
exultation
in
his
voice
the
colonel
smiled
â€œwhy
professorâ€
said
he
â€œi
have
seen
you
more
excited
on
the
morning
when
you
brought
back
lepidus
mercerensis
in
your
collecting-boxâ€
â€œthe
fly
was
safe
in
my
collecting-box
firstâ€
the
entomologist
answered
â€œi
have
seen
so
many
strange
turns
of
fate
in
my
long
life
that
i
do
not
grieve
nor
do
i
rejoice
until
i
know
that
i
have
cause
but
tell
me
the
newsâ€
â€œwellâ€
said
the
colonel
lighting
his
long
pipe
and
stretching
his
gaitered
legs
in
the
bamboo
chair
â€œiâ€™ll
stake
my
military
reputation
that
all
is
well
they
are
advancing
swiftly
the
firing
has
died
down
to
show
that
resistance
is
at
an
end
and
within
an
hour
weâ€™ll
see
them
over
the
brow
ainslie
is
to
fire
his
gun
three
times
from
the
church
tower
as
a
signal
and
then
we
shall
make
a
little
sally
on
our
own
accountâ€
â€œand
you
are
waiting
for
this
signalâ€
â€œyes
we
are
waiting
for
ainslieâ€™s
shots
i
thought
i
would
spend
the
time
with
you
for
i
had
something
to
ask
youâ€
â€œwhat
was
itâ€
â€œwell
you
remember
your
talk
about
the
other
siegeâ€”the
siege
of
sung-tong
it
interests
me
very
much
from
a
professional
point
of
view
now
that
the
ladies
and
civilians
are
gone
you
will
have
no
objection
to
discussing
itâ€
â€œit
is
not
a
pleasant
subjectâ€
â€œno
i
dare
say
not
mein
gott
it
was
indeed
a
tragedy
but
you
have
seen
how
i
have
conducted
the
defence
here
was
it
wise
was
it
good
was
it
worthy
of
the
traditions
of
the
german
armyâ€
â€œi
think
you
could
have
done
no
moreâ€
â€œthank
you
but
this
other
place
was
it
as
ably
defended
to
me
a
comparison
of
this
sort
is
very
interesting
could
it
have
been
savedâ€
â€œno
everything
possible
was
doneâ€”save
only
one
thingâ€
â€œah
there
was
one
omission
what
was
itâ€
â€œno
oneâ€”above
all
no
womanâ€”should
have
been
allowed
to
fall
alive
into
the
hands
of
the
chineseâ€
the
colonel
held
out
his
broad
red
hand
and
enfolded
the
long
white
nervous
fingers
of
the
professor
â€œyou
are
rightâ€”a
thousand
times
right
but
do
not
think
that
this
has
escaped
my
thoughts
for
myself
i
would
die
fighting
so
would
ralston
so
would
ainslie
i
have
talked
to
them
and
it
is
settled
but
the
others
i
have
spoken
with
them
but
what
are
you
to
do
there
are
the
priest
and
the
missionary
and
the
womenâ€
â€œwould
they
wish
to
be
taken
aliveâ€
â€œthey
would
not
promise
to
take
steps
to
prevent
it
they
would
not
lay
hands
on
their
own
lives
their
consciences
would
not
permit
it
of
course
it
is
all
over
now
and
we
need
not
speak
of
such
dreadful
things
but
what
would
you
have
done
in
my
placeâ€
â€œkill
themâ€
â€œmein
gott
you
would
murder
themâ€
â€œin
mercy
i
would
kill
them
man
i
have
been
through
it
i
have
seen
the
death
of
the
hot
eggs
i
have
seen
the
death
of
the
boiling
kettle
i
have
seen
the
womenâ€”my
god
i
wonder
that
i
have
ever
slept
sound
againâ€
his
usually
impassive
face
was
working
and
quivering
with
the
agony
of
the
remembrance
â€œi
was
strapped
to
a
stake
with
thorns
in
my
eyelids
to
keep
them
open
and
my
grief
at
their
torture
was
a
less
thing
than
my
self-reproach
when
i
thought
that
i
could
with
one
tube
of
tasteless
tablets
have
snatched
them
at
the
last
instant
from
the
hands
of
their
tormentors
murder
i
am
ready
to
stand
at
the
divine
bar
and
answer
for
a
thousand
murders
such
as
that
sin
why
it
is
such
an
act
as
might
well
cleanse
the
stain
of
real
sin
from
the
soul
but
if
knowing
what
i
do
i
should
have
failed
this
second
time
to
do
it
then
by
heaven
there
is
no
hell
deep
enough
or
hot
enough
to
receive
my
guilty
craven
spiritâ€
the
colonel
rose
and
again
his
hand
clasped
that
of
the
professor
â€œyou
speak
senseâ€
said
he
â€œyou
are
a
brave
strong
man
who
know
your
own
mind
yes
by
the
lord
you
would
have
been
my
great
help
had
things
gone
the
other
way
i
have
often
thought
and
wondered
in
the
dark
early
hours
of
the
morning
but
i
did
not
know
how
to
do
it
but
we
should
have
heard
ainslieâ€™s
shots
before
now
i
will
go
and
seeâ€
again
the
old
scientist
sat
alone
with
his
thoughts
finally
as
neither
the
guns
of
the
relieving
force
nor
yet
the
signal
of
their
approach
sounded
upon
his
ears
he
rose
and
was
about
to
go
himself
upon
the
ramparts
to
make
inquiry
when
the
door
flew
open
and
colonel
dresler
staggered
into
the
room
his
face
was
of
a
ghastly
yellow-white
and
his
chest
heaved
like
that
of
a
man
exhausted
with
running
there
was
brandy
on
the
side-table
and
he
gulped
down
a
glassful
then
he
dropped
heavily
into
a
chair
â€œwellâ€
said
the
professor
coldly
â€œthey
are
not
comingâ€
â€œno
they
cannot
comeâ€
there
was
silence
for
a
minute
or
more
the
two
men
staring
blankly
at
each
other
â€œdo
they
all
knowâ€
â€œno
one
knows
but
meâ€
â€œhow
did
you
learnâ€
â€œi
was
at
the
wall
near
the
postern
gateâ€”the
little
wooden
gate
that
opens
on
the
rose
garden
i
saw
something
crawling
among
the
bushes
there
was
a
knocking
at
the
door
i
opened
it
it
was
a
christian
tartar
badly
cut
about
with
swords
he
had
come
from
the
battle
commodore
wyndham
the
englishman
had
sent
him
the
relieving
force
had
been
checked
they
had
shot
away
most
of
their
ammunition
they
had
entrenched
themselves
and
sent
back
to
the
ships
for
more
three
days
must
pass
before
they
could
come
that
was
all
mein
gott
it
was
enoughâ€
the
professor
bent
his
shaggy
grey
brows
â€œwhere
is
the
manâ€
he
asked
â€œhe
is
dead
he
died
of
loss
of
blood
his
body
lies
at
the
postern
gateâ€
â€œand
no
one
saw
himâ€
â€œnot
to
speak
toâ€
â€œoh
they
did
see
him
thenâ€
â€œainslie
must
have
seen
him
from
the
church
tower
he
must
know
that
i
have
had
tidings
he
will
want
to
know
what
they
are
if
i
tell
him
they
must
all
knowâ€
â€œhow
long
can
we
hold
outâ€
â€œan
hour
or
two
at
the
mostâ€
â€œis
that
absolutely
certainâ€
â€œi
pledge
my
credit
as
a
soldier
upon
itâ€
â€œthen
we
must
fallâ€
â€œyes
we
must
fallâ€
â€œthere
is
no
hope
for
usâ€
â€œnoneâ€
the
door
flew
open
and
young
ainslie
rushed
in
behind
him
crowded
ralston
patterson
and
a
crowd
of
white
men
and
of
native
christians
â€œyouâ€™ve
had
news
colonelâ€
professor
mercer
pushed
to
the
front
â€œcolonel
dresler
has
just
been
telling
me
it
is
all
right
they
have
halted
but
will
be
here
in
the
early
morning
there
is
no
longer
any
dangerâ€
a
cheer
broke
from
the
group
in
the
doorway
everyone
was
laughing
and
shaking
hands
â€œbut
suppose
they
rush
us
before
to-morrow
morningâ€
cried
ralston
in
a
petulant
voice
â€œwhat
infernal
fools
these
fellows
are
not
to
push
on
lazy
devils
they
should
be
court-martialled
every
man
of
themâ€
â€œitâ€™s
all
safeâ€
said
ainslie
â€œthese
fellows
have
had
a
bad
knock
we
can
see
their
wounded
being
carried
by
the
hundred
over
the
hill
they
must
have
lost
heavily
they
wonâ€™t
attack
before
morningâ€
â€œno
noâ€
said
the
colonel
â€œit
is
certain
that
they
wonâ€™t
attack
before
morning
none
the
less
get
back
to
your
posts
we
must
give
no
point
awayâ€
he
left
the
room
with
the
rest
but
as
he
did
so
he
looked
back
and
his
eyes
for
an
instant
met
those
of
the
old
professor
â€œi
leave
it
in
your
handsâ€
was
the
message
which
he
flashed
a
stern
set
smile
was
his
answer





the
afternoon
wore
away
without
the
boxers
making
their
last
attack
to
colonel
dresler
it
was
clear
that
the
unwonted
stillness
meant
only
that
they
were
reassembling
their
forces
from
their
fight
with
the
relief
column
and
were
gathering
themselves
for
the
inevitable
and
final
rush
to
all
the
others
it
appeared
that
the
siege
was
indeed
over
and
that
the
assailants
had
been
crippled
by
the
losses
which
they
had
already
sustained
it
was
a
joyous
and
noisy
party
therefore
which
met
at
the
supper-table
when
the
three
bottles
of
lachryma
christi
were
uncorked
and
the
famous
port
of
caviare
was
finally
opened
it
was
a
large
jar
and
though
each
had
a
tablespoonful
of
the
delicacy
it
was
by
no
means
exhausted
ralston
who
was
an
epicure
had
a
double
allowance
he
pecked
away
at
it
like
a
hungry
bird
ainslie
too
had
a
second
helping
the
professor
took
a
large
spoonful
himself
and
colonel
dresler
watching
him
narrowly
did
the
same
the
ladies
ate
freely
save
only
pretty
miss
patterson
who
disliked
the
salty
pungent
taste
in
spite
of
the
hospitable
entreaties
of
the
professor
her
portion
lay
hardly
touched
at
the
side
of
her
plate
â€œyou
donâ€™t
like
my
little
delicacy
it
is
a
disappointment
to
me
when
i
had
kept
it
for
your
pleasureâ€
said
the
old
man
â€œi
beg
that
you
will
eat
the
caviareâ€
â€œi
have
never
tasted
it
before
no
doubt
i
should
like
it
in
timeâ€
â€œwell
you
must
make
a
beginning
why
not
start
to
educate
your
taste
now
do
pleaseâ€
pretty
jessie
pattersonâ€™s
bright
face
shone
with
her
sunny
boyish
smile
â€œwhy
how
earnest
you
areâ€
she
laughed
â€œi
had
no
idea
you
were
so
polite
professor
mercer
even
if
i
do
not
eat
it
i
am
just
as
gratefulâ€
â€œyou
are
foolish
not
to
eat
itâ€
said
the
professor
with
such
intensity
that
the
smile
died
from
her
face
and
her
eyes
reflected
the
earnestness
of
his
own
â€œi
tell
you
it
is
foolish
not
to
eat
caviare
to-nightâ€
â€œbut
whyâ€”whyâ€
she
asked
â€œbecause
you
have
it
on
your
plate
because
it
is
sinful
to
waste
itâ€
â€œthere
thereâ€
said
stout
mrs
patterson
leaning
across
â€œdonâ€™t
trouble
her
any
more
i
can
see
that
she
does
not
like
it
but
it
shall
not
be
wastedâ€
she
passed
the
blade
of
her
knife
under
it
and
scraped
it
from
jessieâ€™s
plate
on
to
her
own
â€œnow
it
wonâ€™t
be
wasted
your
mind
will
be
at
ease
professorâ€
but
it
did
not
seem
at
ease
on
the
contrary
his
face
was
agitated
like
that
of
a
man
who
encounters
an
unexpected
and
formidable
obstacle
he
was
lost
in
thought
the
conversation
buzzed
cheerily
everyone
was
full
of
his
future
plans
â€œno
no
there
is
no
holiday
for
meâ€
said
father
pierre
â€œwe
priests
donâ€™t
get
holidays
now
that
the
mission
and
school
are
formed
i
am
to
leave
it
to
father
amiel
and
to
push
westwards
to
found
anotherâ€
â€œyou
are
leavingâ€
said
mr
patterson
â€œyou
donâ€™t
mean
that
you
are
going
away
from
ichauâ€
father
pierre
shook
his
venerable
head
in
waggish
reproof
â€œyou
must
not
look
so
pleased
mr
pattersonâ€
â€œwell
well
our
views
are
very
differentâ€
said
the
presbyterian
â€œbut
there
is
no
personal
feeling
towards
you
father
pierre
at
the
same
time
how
any
reasonable
educated
man
at
this
time
of
the
worldâ€™s
history
can
teach
these
poor
benighted
heathen
thatâ€”â€”â€
a
general
buzz
of
remonstrance
silenced
the
theology
â€œwhat
will
you
do
yourself
mr
pattersonâ€
asked
someone
â€œwell
iâ€™ll
take
three
months
in
edinburgh
to
attend
the
annual
meeting
youâ€™ll
be
glad
to
do
some
shopping
in
princes
street
iâ€™m
thinking
mary
and
you
jessie
youâ€™ll
see
some
folk
your
own
age
then
we
can
come
back
in
the
fall
when
your
nerves
have
had
a
restâ€
â€œindeed
we
shall
all
need
itâ€
said
miss
sinclair
the
mission
nurse
â€œyou
know
this
long
strain
takes
me
in
the
strangest
way
at
the
present
moment
i
can
hear
such
a
buzzing
in
my
earsâ€
â€œwell
thatâ€™s
funny
for
itâ€™s
just
the
same
with
meâ€
cried
ainslie
â€œan
absurd
up-and-down
buzzing
as
if
a
drunken
bluebottle
were
trying
experiments
on
his
register
as
you
say
it
must
be
due
to
nervous
strain
for
my
part
i
am
going
back
to
peking
and
i
hope
i
may
get
some
promotion
over
this
affair
i
can
get
good
polo
here
and
thatâ€™s
as
fine
a
change
of
thought
as
i
know
how
about
you
ralstonâ€
â€œoh
i
donâ€™t
know
iâ€™ve
hardly
had
time
to
think
i
want
to
have
a
real
good
sunny
bright
holiday
and
forget
it
all
it
was
funny
to
see
all
the
letters
in
my
room
it
looked
so
black
on
wednesday
night
that
i
had
settled
up
my
affairs
and
written
to
all
my
friends
i
donâ€™t
quite
know
how
they
were
to
be
delivered
but
i
trusted
to
luck
i
think
i
will
keep
those
papers
as
a
souvenir
they
will
always
remind
me
of
how
close
a
shave
we
have
hadâ€
â€œyes
i
would
keep
themâ€
said
dresler
his
voice
was
so
deep
and
solemn
that
every
eye
was
turned
upon
him
â€œwhat
is
it
colonel
you
seem
in
the
blues
to-nightâ€
it
was
ainslie
who
spoke
â€œno
no
i
am
very
contentedâ€
â€œwell
so
you
should
be
when
you
see
success
in
sight
i
am
sure
we
are
all
indebted
to
you
for
your
science
and
skill
i
donâ€™t
think
we
could
have
held
the
place
without
you
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
ask
you
to
drink
the
health
of
colonel
dresler
of
the
imperial
german
army
er
soll
lebenâ€”hochâ€
they
all
stood
up
and
raised
their
glasses
to
the
soldier
with
smiles
and
bows
his
pale
face
flushed
with
professional
pride
â€œi
have
always
kept
my
books
with
me
i
have
forgotten
nothingâ€
said
he
â€œi
do
not
think
that
more
could
be
done
if
things
had
gone
wrong
with
us
and
the
place
had
fallen
you
would
i
am
sure
have
freed
me
from
any
blame
or
responsibilityâ€
he
looked
wistfully
round
him
â€œiâ€™m
voicing
the
sentiments
of
this
company
colonel
dreslerâ€
said
the
scotch
minister
â€œwhen
i
sayâ€”â€”but
lord
save
us
whatâ€™s
amiss
with
mr
ralstonâ€
he
had
dropped
his
face
upon
his
folded
arms
and
was
placidly
sleeping
â€œdonâ€™t
mind
himâ€
said
the
professor
hurriedly
â€œwe
are
all
in
the
stage
of
reaction
now
i
have
no
doubt
that
we
are
all
liable
to
collapse
it
is
only
to-night
that
we
shall
feel
what
we
have
gone
throughâ€
â€œiâ€™m
sure
i
can
fully
sympathize
with
himâ€
said
mrs
patterson
â€œi
donâ€™t
know
when
i
have
been
more
sleepy
i
can
hardly
hold
my
own
head
upâ€
she
cuddled
back
in
her
chair
and
shut
her
eyes
â€œwell
iâ€™ve
never
known
mary
do
that
beforeâ€
cried
her
husband
laughing
heartily
â€œgone
to
sleep
over
her
supper
what
ever
will
she
think
when
we
tell
her
of
it
afterwards
but
the
air
does
seem
hot
and
heavy
i
can
certainly
excuse
any
one
who
falls
asleep
to-night
i
think
that
i
shall
turn
in
early
myselfâ€
ainslie
was
in
a
talkative
excited
mood
he
was
on
his
feet
once
more
with
his
glass
in
his
hand
â€œi
think
that
we
ought
to
have
one
drink
all
together
and
then
sing
â€˜auld
lang
syneâ€™â€
said
he
smiling
round
at
the
company
â€œfor
a
week
we
have
all
pulled
in
the
same
boat
and
weâ€™ve
got
to
know
each

as
people
never
do
in
the
quiet
days
of
peace

learned

gone
to
sleep
tooâ€”most
infernal
sleepy
weatherâ€
his
glass
crashed
down
upon
the
table
and
he
sank
back
mumbling
and
muttering
into
his
seat
miss
sinclair
the
pale
mission
nurse
had
dropped
off
also
she
lay
like
a
broken
lily
across
the
arm
of
her
chair
mr
patterson
looked
round
him
and
sprang
to
his
feet
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
flushed
forehead
â€œthis
isnâ€™t
natural

he
cried
â€œwhy
are

asleep

off

he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
rushed
to
the
windows
but
midway
his
head
spun
round
his
knees
sank
under
him
and
he
pitched
forward
upon
his
face
the
young
girl
had
also
sprung
to
her
feet
she
looked
round
her
with
horror-stricken
eyes
at
her
prostrate
father
and
the
silent
ring
of
figures
â€œprofessor
mercer
what
is
it
what
is
itâ€
she
cried
â€œoh
my
god
they
are
dying
they
are
deadâ€
the
old
man
had
raised
himself
by
a
supreme
effort
of
his
will
though
the
darkness
was
already
gathering
thickly
round
him
â€œmy
dear
young
ladyâ€
he
said
stuttering
and
stumbling
over
the
words
â€œwe
would
have
spared
you
this
it
would
have
been
painless
to
mind
and
body
it
was
cyanide
i
had

in
the
caviare
but
you
would
not
have
itâ€
â€œgreat
heavenâ€
she
shrank
away
from
him
with
dilated
eyes
â€œoh
you
monster
you
monster
you
have
poisoned
themâ€
â€œno
no
i
saved
them
you
donâ€™t
know
the
chinese
they
are
horrible
in
another
hour
we
should
all
have
been
in
their
hands
take
it
now
childâ€
even
as
he
spoke
a
burst
of
firing
broke
out
under
the
very
windows
of
the
room
â€œhark
there
they
are
quick
dear
quick
you
may
cheat
them
yetâ€
but
his
words
fell
upon
deaf
ears
for
the
girl
had
sunk
back
senseless
in
her
chair
the
old
man
stood
listening
for
an
instant
to
the
firing
outside
but
what
was
that
merciful
father
what
was
that
was
he
going
mad
was
it
the
effect
of
the
drug
surely
it
was
a
european
cheer
yes
there
were
sharp
orders
in
english
there
was
the
shouting
of
sailors
he
could
no
longer
doubt
it
by
some
miracle
the
relief
had
come
after
all
he
threw
his
long
arms
upwards
in
his
despair
â€œwhat
have
i
done
oh
good
lord
what
have
i
doneâ€
he
cried





it
was
commodore
wyndham
himself
who
was
the
first
after
his
desperate
and
successful
night
attack
to
burst
into
that
terrible
supper-room
round
the
table
sat
the
white
and
silent
company
only
in
the
young
girl
who
moaned
and
faintly
stirred
was
any
sign
of
life
to
be
seen
and
yet
there
was
one
in
the
circle
who
had
the
energy
for
a
last
supreme
duty
the
commodore
standing
stupefied
at
the
door
saw
a
grey
head
slowly
lifted
from
the
table
and
the
tall
form
of
the
professor
staggered
for
an
instant
to
its
feet
â€œtake
care
of
the
caviare
for
godâ€™s
sake
donâ€™t
touch
the
caviareâ€
he
croaked
then
he
sank
back
once
more
and
the
circle
of
death
was
complete
the
japanned
box
it
was
a
curious
thing
said
the
private
tutor
one
of
those
grotesque
and
whimsical
incidents
which
occur
to
one
as
one
goes
through
life
i
lost
the
best
situation
which
i
am
ever
likely
to
have
through
it
but
i
am
glad
that
i
went
to
thorpe
place
for
i
gainedâ€”well
as
i
tell
you
the
story
you
will
learn
what
i
gained
i
donâ€™t
know
whether
you
are
familiar
with
that
part
of
the
midlands
which
is
drained
by
the
avon
it
is
the
most
english
part
of
england
shakespeare
the
flower
of
the
whole
race
was
born
right
in
the
middle
of
it
it
is
a
land
of
rolling
pastures
rising
in
higher
folds
to
the
westward
until
they
swell
into
the
malvern
hills
there
are
no
towns
but
numerous
villages

with
its
grey
norman
church
you
have
left
the
brick
of
the
southern
and
eastern
counties
behind
you
and
everything
is
stoneâ€”stone
for
the
walls
and
lichened
slabs
of
stone
for
the
roofs
it
is
all
grim
and
solid
and
massive
as
befits
the
heart
of
a
great
nation
it
was
in
the
middle
of
this
country
not
very
far
from
evesham
that
sir
john
bollamore
lived
in
the
old
ancestral
home
of
thorpe
place
and
thither
it
was
that
i
came
to
teach
his
two
little
sons
sir
john
was
a
widowerâ€”his
wife
had
died
three
years
beforeâ€”and
he
had
been
left
with
these
two
lads
aged
eight
and
ten
and
one
dear
little
girl
of
seven
miss
witherton
who
is
now
my
wife
was
governess
to
this
little
girl
i
was
tutor
to
the
two
boys
could
there
be
a
more
obvious
prelude
to
an
engagement
she
governs
me
now
and
i
tutor
two
little
boys
of
our
own
but
thereâ€”i
have
already
revealed
what
it
was
which
i
gained
in
thorpe
place
it
was
a
very
very
old
house
incredibly
oldâ€”pre-norman
some
of
itâ€”and
the
bollamores
claimed
to
have
lived
in
that
situation
since
long
before
the
conquest
it
struck
a
chill
to
my
heart
when
first
i
came
there
those
enormously
thick
grey
walls
the
rude
crumbling
stones
the
smell
as
from
a
sick
animal
which
exhaled
from
the
rotting
plaster
of
the
aged
building
but
the
modern
wing
was
bright
and
the
garden
was
well
kept
no
house
could
be
dismal
which
had
a
pretty
girl
inside
it
and
such
a
show
of
roses
in
front
apart
from
a
very
complete
staff
of
servants
there
were
only
four
of
us
in
the
household
these
were
miss
witherton
who
was
at
that
time
four-and-twenty
and
as
prettyâ€”well
as
pretty
as
mrs
colmore
is
nowâ€”myself
frank
colmore
aged
thirty
mrs
stevens
the
housekeeper
a
dry
silent
woman
and
mr
richards
a
tall
military-looking
man
who
acted
as
steward
to
the
bollamore
estates
we
four
always
had
our
meals
together
but
sir
john
had
his
usually
alone
in
the
library
sometimes
he
joined
us
at
dinner
but
on
the
whole
we
were
just
as
glad
when
he
did
not
for
he
was
a
very
formidable
person
imagine
a
man
six
feet
three
inches
in
height
majestically
built
with
a
high-nosed
aristocratic
face
brindled
hair
shaggy
eyebrows
a
small
pointed
mephistophelian
beard
and
lines
upon
his
brow
and
round
his
eyes
as
deep
as
if
they
had
been
carved
with
a
penknife
he
had
grey
eyes
weary
hopeless-looking
eyes
proud
and
yet
pathetic
eyes
which
claimed
your
pity
and
yet
dared
you
to
show
it
his
back
was
rounded
with
study
but
otherwise
he
was
as
fine
a
looking
man
of
his
ageâ€”five-and-fifty
perhapsâ€”as
any
woman
would
wish
to
look
upon
but
his
presence
was
not
a
cheerful
one
he
was
always
courteous
always
refined
but
singularly
silent
and
retiring
i
have
never
lived
so
long
with
any
man
and
known
so
little
of
him
if
he
were
indoors
he
spent
his
time
either
in
his
own
small
study
in
the
eastern
tower
or
in
the
library
in
the
modern
wing
so
regular
was
his
routine
that
one
could
always
say
at
any
hour
exactly
where
he
would
be
twice
in
the
day
he
would
visit
his
study
once
after
breakfast
and
once
about
ten
at
night
you
might
set
your
watch
by
the
slam
of
the
heavy
door
for
the
rest
of
the
day
he
would
be
in
his
libraryâ€”save
that
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
afternoon
he
would
take
a
walk
or
a
ride
which
was
solitary
like
the
rest
of
his
existence
he
loved
his
children
and
was
keenly
interested
in
the
progress
of
their
studies
but
they
were
a
little
awed
by
the
silent
shaggy-browed
figure
and
they
avoided
him
as
much
as
they
could
indeed
we
all
did
that
it
was
some
time
before
i
came
to
know
anything
about
the
circumstances
of
sir
john
bollamoreâ€™s
life
for
mrs
stevens
the
housekeeper
and
mr
richards
the
land-steward
were
too
loyal
to
talk
easily
of
their
employerâ€™s
affairs
as
to
the
governess
she
knew
no
more
than
i
did
and
our
common
interest
was
one
of
the
causes
which
drew
us
together
at
last
however
an
incident
occurred
which
led
to
a
closer
acquaintance
with
mr
richards
and
a
fuller
knowledge
of
the
life
of
the
man
whom
i
served
the
immediate
cause
of
this
was
no
less
than
the
falling
of
master
percy
the
youngest
of
my
pupils
into
the
mill-race
with
imminent
danger
both
to
his
life
and
to
mine
since
i
had
to
risk
myself
in
order
to
save
him
dripping
and
exhaustedâ€”for
i
was
far
more
spent
than
the
childâ€”i
was
making
for
my
room
when
sir
john
who
had
heard
the
hubbub
opened
the
door
of
his
little
study
and
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
i
told
him
of
the
accident
but
assured
him
that
his
child
was
in
no
danger
while
he
listened
with
a
rugged
immobile
face
which
expressed
in
its
intense
eyes
and
tightened
lips
all
the
emotion
which
he
tried
to
conceal
â€œone
moment
step
in
here
let
me
have
the
detailsâ€
said
he
turning
back
through
the
open
door
and
so
i
found
myself
within
that
little
sanctum
inside
which
as
i
afterwards
learned
no
other
foot
had
for
three
years
been
set
save
that
of
the
old
servant
who
cleaned
it
out
it
was
a
round
room
conforming
to
the
shape
of
the
tower
in
which
it
was
situated
with
a
low
ceiling
a
single
narrow
ivy-wreathed
window
and
the
simplest
of
furniture
an
old
carpet
a
single
chair
a
deal
table
and
a
small
shelf
of
books
made
up
the
whole
contents
on
the
table
stood
a
full-length
photograph
of
a
womanâ€”i
took
no
particular
notice
of
the
features
but
i
remember
that
a
certain
gracious
gentleness
was
the
prevailing
impression
beside
it
were
a
large
black
japanned
box
and
one
or
two
bundles
of
letters
or
papers
fastened
together
with
elastic
bands
our
interview
was
a
short
one
for
sir
john
bollamore
perceived
that
i
was
soaked
and
that
i
should
change
without
delay
the
incident
led
however
to
an
instructive
talk
with
richards
the
agent
who
had
never
penetrated
into
the
chamber
which
chance
had
opened
to
me
that
very
afternoon
he
came
to
me
all
curiosity
and
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
path
with
me
while
my
two
charges
played
tennis
upon
the
lawn
beside
us
â€œyou
hardly
realize
the
exception
which
has
been
made
in
your
favourâ€
said
he
â€œthat
room
has
been
kept
such
a
mystery
and
sir
johnâ€™s
visits
to
it
have
been
so
regular
and
consistent
that
an
almost
superstitious
feeling
has
arisen
about
it
in
the
household
i
assure
you
that
if
i
were
to
repeat
to
you
the
tales
which
are
flying
about
tales
of
mysterious
visitors
there
and
of
voices
overheard
by
the
servants
you
might
suspect
that
sir
john
had
relapsed
into
his
old
waysâ€
â€œwhy
do
you
say
relapsedâ€
i
asked
he
looked
at
me
in
surprise
â€œis
it
possibleâ€
said
he
â€œthat
sir
john
bollamoreâ€™s
previous
history
is
unknown
to
youâ€
â€œabsolutelyâ€
â€œyou
astound
me
i
thought
that
every
man
in
england
knew
something
of
his
antecedents
i
should
not
mention
the
matter
if
it
were
not
that
you
are
now
one
of
ourselves
and
that
the
facts
might
come
to
your
ears
in
some
harsher
form
if
i
were
silent
upon
them
i
always
took
it
for
granted
that
you
knew
that
you
were
in
the
service
of
â€˜devilâ€™
bollamoreâ€
â€œbut
why
â€˜devilâ€™â€
i
asked
â€œah
you
are
young
and
the
world
moves
fast
but
twenty
years
ago
the
name
of
â€˜devilâ€™
bollamore
was
one
of
the
best
known
in
london
he
was
the
leader
of
the
fastest
set
bruiser
driver
gambler
drunkardâ€”a
survival
of
the
old
type
and
as
bad
as
the
worst
of
themâ€
i
stared
at
him
in
amazement
â€œwhatâ€
i
cried
â€œthat
quiet
studious
sad-faced
manâ€
â€œthe
greatest
rip
and
debauchee
in
england
all
between
ourselves
colmore
but
you
understand
now
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
a
womanâ€™s
voice
in
his
room
might
even
now
give
rise
to
suspicionsâ€
â€œbut
what
can
have
changed
him
soâ€
â€œlittle
beryl
clare
when
she
took
the
risk
of
becoming
his
wife
that
was
the
turning
point
he
had
got
so
far
that
his
own
fast
set
had
thrown
him
over
there
is
a
world
of
difference
you
know
between
a
man
who
drinks
and
a
drunkard
they
all
drink
but
they
taboo
a
drunkard
he
had
become
a
slave
to
itâ€”hopeless
and
helpless
then
she
stepped
in
saw
the
possibilities
of
a
fine
man
in
the
wreck
took
her
chance
in
marrying
him
though
she
might
have
had
the
pick
of
a
dozen
and
by
devoting
her
life
to
it
brought
him
back
to
manhood
and
decency
you
have
observed
that
no
liquor
is
ever
kept
in
the
house
there
never
has
been
any
since
her
foot
crossed
its
threshold
a
drop
of
it
would
be
like
blood
to
a
tiger
even
nowâ€
â€œthen
her
influence
still
holds
himâ€
â€œthat
is
the
wonder
of
it
when
she
died
three
years
ago
we
all
expected
and
feared
that
he
would
fall
back
into
his
old
ways
she
feared
it
herself
and
the
thought
gave
a
terror
to
death
for
she
was
like
a
guardian
angel
to
that
man
and
lived
only
for
the
one
purpose
by
the
way
did
you
see
a
black
japanned
box
in
his
roomâ€
â€œyesâ€
â€œi
fancy
it
contains
her
letters
if
ever
he
has
occasion
to
be
away
if
only
for
a
single
night
he
invariably
takes
his
black
japanned
box
with
him
well
well
colmore
perhaps
i
have
told
you
rather
more
than
i
should
but
i
shall
expect
you
to
reciprocate
if
anything
of
interest
should
come
to
your
knowledgeâ€
i
could
see
that
the
worthy
man
was
consumed
with
curiosity
and
just
a
little
piqued
that
i
the
new-comer
should
have
been
the
first
to
penetrate
into
the
untrodden
chamber
but
the
fact
raised
me
in
his
esteem
and
from
that
time
onwards
i
found
myself
upon
more
confidential
terms
with
him
and
now
the
silent
and
majestic
figure
of
my
employer
became
an
object
of
greater
interest
to
me
i
began
to
understand
that
strangely
human
look
in
his
eyes
those
deep
lines
upon
his
careworn
face
he
was
a
man
who
was
fighting
a
ceaseless
battle
holding
at
armâ€™s
length
from
morning
till
night
a
horrible
adversary
who
was
for
ever
trying
to
close
with
himâ€”an
adversary
which
would
destroy
him
body
and
soul
could
it
but
fix
its
claws
once
more
upon
him
as
i
watched
the
grim
round-backed
figure
pacing
the
corridor
or
walking
in
the
garden
this
imminent
danger
seemed
to
take
bodily
shape
and
i
could
almost
fancy
that
i
saw
this
most
loathsome
and
dangerous
of
all
the
fiends
crouching
closely
in
his
very
shadow
like
a
half-cowed
beast
which
slinks
beside
its
keeper
ready
at
any
unguarded
moment
to
spring
at
his
throat
and
the
dead
woman
the
woman
who
had
spent
her
life
in
warding
off
this
danger
took
shape
also
to
my
imagination
and
i
saw
her
as
a
shadowy
but
beautiful
presence
which
intervened
for
ever
with
arms
uplifted
to
screen
the
man
whom
she
loved
in
some
subtle
way
he
divined
the
sympathy
which
i
had
for
him
and
he
showed
in
his
own
silent
fashion
that
he
appreciated
it
he
even
invited
me
once
to
share
his
afternoon
walk
and
although
no
word
passed
between
us
on
this
occasion
it
was
a
mark
of
confidence
which
he
had
never
shown
to
any
one
before
he
asked
me
also
to
index
his
library
it
was
one
of
the
best
private
libraries
in
england
and
i
spent
many
hours
in
the
evening
in
his
presence
if
not
in
his
society
he
reading
at
his
desk
and
i
sitting
in
a
recess
by
the
window
reducing
to
order
the
chaos
which
existed
among
his
books
in
spite
of
these
close
relations
i
was
never
again
asked
to
enter
the
chamber
in
the
turret
and
then
came
my
revulsion
of
feeling
a
single
incident
changed
all
my
sympathy
to
loathing
and
made
me
realize
that
my
employer
still
remained
all
that
he
had
ever
been
with
the
additional
vice
of
hypocrisy
what
happened
was
as
follows
one
evening
miss
witherton
had
gone
down
to
broadway
the
neighbouring
village
to
sing
at
a
concert
for
some
charity
and
i
according
to
my
promise
had
walked
over
to
escort
her
back
the
drive
sweeps
round
under
the
eastern
turret
and
i
observed
as
i
passed
that
the
light
was
lit
in
the
circular
room
it
was
a
summer
evening
and
the
window
which
was
a
little
higher
than
our
heads
was
open
we
were
as
it
happened
engrossed
in
our
own
conversation
at
the
moment
and
we
had
paused
upon
the
lawn
which
skirts
the
old
turret
when
suddenly
something
broke
in
upon
our
talk
and
turned
our
thoughts
away
from
our
own
affairs
it
was
a
voiceâ€”the
voice
undoubtedly
of
a
woman
it
was
lowâ€”so
low
that
it
was
only
in
that
still
night
air
that
we
could
have
heard
it
but
hushed
as
it
was
there
was
no
mistaking
its
feminine
timbre
it
spoke
hurriedly
gaspingly
for
a
few
sentences
and
then
was
silentâ€”a
piteous
breathless
imploring
sort
of
voice
miss
witherton
and
i
stood
for
an
instant
staring
at
each
other
then
we
walked
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
hall-door
â€œit
came
through
the
windowâ€
i
said
â€œwe
must
not
play
the
part
of
eavesdroppersâ€
she
answered
â€œwe
must
forget
that
we
have
ever
heard
itâ€
there
was
an
absence
of
surprise
in
her
manner
which
suggested
a
new
idea
to
me
â€œyou
have
heard
it
beforeâ€
i
cried
â€œi
could
not
help
it
my
own
room
is
higher
up
on
the
same
turret
it
has
happened
frequentlyâ€
â€œwho
can
the
woman
beâ€
â€œi
have
no
idea
i
had
rather
not
discuss
itâ€
her
voice
was
enough
to
show
me
what
she
thought
but
granting
that
our
employer
led
a
double
and
dubious
life
who
could
she
be
this
mysterious
woman
who
kept
him
company
in
the
old
tower
i
knew
from
my
own
inspection
how
bleak
and
bare
a
room
it
was
she
certainly
did
not
live
there
but
in
that
case
where
did
she
come
from
it
could
not
be
any
one
of
the
household
they
were
all
under
the
vigilant
eyes
of
mrs
stevens
the
visitor
must
come
from
without
but
how
and
then
suddenly
i
remembered
how
ancient
this
building
was
and
how
probable
that
some
mediã¦val
passage
existed
in
it
there
is
hardly
an
old
castle
without
one
the
mysterious
room
was
the
basement
of
the
turret
so
that
if
there
were
anything
of
the
sort
it
would
open
through
the
floor
there
were
numerous
cottages
in
the
immediate
vicinity
the
other
end
of
the
secret
passage
might
lie
among
some
tangle
of
bramble
in
the
neighbouring
copse
i
said
nothing
to
any
one
but
i
felt
that
the
secret
of
my
employer
lay
within
my
power
and
the
more
convinced
i
was
of
this
the
more
i
marvelled
at
the
manner
in
which
he
concealed
his
true
nature
often
as
i
watched
his
austere
figure
i
asked
myself
if
it
were
indeed
possible
that
such
a
man
should
be
living
this
double
life
and
i
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
my
suspicions
might
after
all
prove
to
be
ill-founded
but
there
was
the
female
voice
there
was
the
secret
nightly
rendezvous
in
the
turret
chamberâ€”how
could
such
facts
admit
of
an
innocent
interpretation
i
conceived
a
horror
of
the
man
i
was
filled
with
loathing
at
his
deep
consistent
hypocrisy
only
once
during
all
those
months
did
i
ever
see
him
without
that
sad
but
impassive
mask
which
he
usually
presented
towards
his
fellow-man
for
an
instant
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
those
volcanic
fires
which
he
had
damped
down
so
long
the
occasion
was
an
unworthy
one
for
the
object
of
his
wrath
was
none
other
than
the
aged
charwoman
whom
i
have
already
mentioned
as
being
the
one
person
who
was
allowed
within
his
mysterious
chamber
i
was
passing
the
corridor
which
led
to
the
turretâ€”for
my
own
room
lay
in
that
directionâ€”when
i
heard
a
sudden
startled
scream
and
merged
in
it
the
husky
growling
note
of
a
man
who
is
inarticulate
with
passion
it
was
the
snarl
of
a
furious
wild
beast
then
i
heard
his
voice
thrilling
with
anger
â€œyou
would
dareâ€
he
cried
â€œyou
would
dare
to
disobey
my
directionsâ€
an
instant
later
the
charwoman
passed
me
flying
down
the
passage
white
faced
and
tremulous
while
the
terrible
voice
thundered
behind
her
â€œgo
to
mrs
stevens
for
your
money
never
set
foot
in
thorpe
place
againâ€
consumed
with
curiosity
i
could
not
help
following
the
woman
and
found
her
round
the
corner
leaning
against
the
wall
and
palpitating
like
a
frightened
rabbit
â€œwhat
is
the
matter
mrs
brownâ€
i
asked
â€œitâ€™s
masterâ€
she
gasped
â€œoh
â€˜ow
â€˜e
frightened
me
if
you
had
seen
â€˜is
eyes
mr
colmore
sir
i
thought
â€˜e
would
â€˜ave
been
the
death
of
meâ€
â€œbut
what
had
you
doneâ€
â€œdone
sir
nothing
at
least
nothing
to
make
so
much
of
just
laid
my
â€˜and
on
that
black
box
of
â€˜isâ€”â€˜adnâ€™t
even
opened
it
when
in
â€˜e
came
and
you
â€˜eard
the
way
â€˜e
went
on
iâ€™ve
lost
my
place
and
glad
i
am
of
it
for
i
would
never
trust
myself
within
reach
of
â€˜im
againâ€
so
it
was
the
japanned
box
which
was
the
cause
of
this
outburstâ€”the
box
from
which
he
would
never
permit
himself
to
be
separated
what
was
the
connection
or
was
there
any
connection
between
this
and
the
secret
visits
of
the
lady
whose
voice
i
had
overheard
sir
john
bollamoreâ€™s
wrath
was
enduring
as
well
as
fiery
for
from
that
day
mrs
brown
the
charwoman
vanished
from
our
ken
and
thorpe
place
knew
her
no
more
and
now
i
wish
to
tell
you
the
singular
chance
which
solved
all
these
strange
questions
and
put
my
employerâ€™s
secret
in
my
possession
the
story
may
leave
you
with
some
lingering
doubt
as
to
whether
my
curiosity
did
not
get
the
better
of
my
honour
and
whether
i
did
not
condescend
to
play
the
spy
if
you
choose
to
think
so
i
cannot
help
it
but
can
only
assure
you
that
improbable
as
it
may
appear
the
matter
came
about
exactly
as
i
describe
it
the
first
stage
in
this
dã©nouement
was
that
the
small
room
on
the
turret
became
uninhabitable
this
occurred
through
the
fall
of
the
worm-eaten
oaken
beam
which
supported
the
ceiling
rotten
with
age
it
snapped
in
the
middle
one
morning
and
brought
down
a
quantity
of
plaster
with
it
fortunately
sir
john
was
not
in
the
room
at
the
time
his
precious
box
was
rescued
from
amongst
the
dã©bris
and
brought
into
the
library
where
henceforward
it
was
locked
within
his
bureau
sir
john
took
no
steps
to
repair
the
damage
and
i
never
had
an
opportunity
of
searching
for
that
secret
passage
the
existence
of
which
i
had
surmised
as
to
the
lady
i
had
thought
that
this
would
have
brought
her
visits
to
an
end
had
i
not
one
evening
heard
mr
richards
asking
mrs
stevens
who
the
woman
was
whom
he
had
overheard
talking
to
sir
john
in
the
library
i
could
not
catch
her
reply
but
i
saw
from
her
manner
that
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
had
to
answer
or
avoid
the
same
question
â€œyouâ€™ve
heard
the
voice
colmoreâ€
said
the
agent
i
confessed
that
i
had
â€œand
what
do
you
think
of
itâ€
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
remarked
that
it
was
no
business
of
mine
â€œcome
come
you
are
just
as
curious
as
any
of
us
is
it
a
woman
or
notâ€
â€œit
is
certainly
a
womanâ€
â€œwhich
room
did
you
hear
it
fromâ€
â€œfrom
the
turret-room
before
the
ceiling
fellâ€
â€œbut
i
heard
it
from
the
library
only
last
night
i
passed
the
doors
as
i
was
going
to
bed
and
i
heard
something
wailing
and
praying
just
as
plainly
as
i
hear
you
it
may
be
a
womanâ€”â€”â€
â€œwhy
what
else
could
it
beâ€
he
looked
at
me
hard
â€œthere
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earthâ€
said
he
â€œif
it
is
a
woman
how
does
she
get
thereâ€
â€œi
donâ€™t
knowâ€
â€œno
nor
i
but
if
it
is
the
other
thingâ€”but
there
for
a
practical
business
man
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
this
is
rather
a
ridiculous
line
of
conversationâ€
he
turned
away
but
i
saw
that
he
felt
even
more
than
he
had
said
to
all
the
old
ghost
stories
of
thorpe
place
a
new
one
was
being
added
before
our
very
eyes
it
may
by
this
time
have
taken
its
permanent
place
for
though
an
explanation
came
to
me
it
never
reached
the
others
and
my
explanation
came
in
this
way
i
had
suffered
a
sleepless
night
from
neuralgia
and
about
mid-day
i
had
taken
a
heavy
dose
of
chlorodyne
to
alleviate
the
pain
at
that
time
i
was
finishing
the
indexing
of
sir
john
bollamoreâ€™s
library
and
it
was
my
custom
to
work
there
from
five
till
seven
on
this
particular
day
i
struggled
against
the
double
effect
of
my
bad
night
and
the
narcotic
i
have
already
mentioned
that
there
was
a
recess
in
the
library
and
in
this
it
was
my
habit
to
work
i
settled
down
steadily
to
my
task
but
my
weariness
overcame
me
and
falling
back
upon
the
settee
i
dropped
into
a
heavy
sleep
how
long
i
slept
i
do
not
know
but
it
was
quite
dark
when
i
awoke
confused
by
the
chlorodyne
which
i
had
taken
i
lay
motionless
in
a
semi-conscious
state
the
great
room
with
its
high
walls
covered
with
books
loomed
darkly
all
round
me
a
dim
radiance
from
the
moonlight
came
through
the
farther
window
and
against
this
lighter
background
i
saw
that
sir
john
bollamore
was
sitting
at
his
study
table
his
well-set
head
and
clearly
cut
profile
were
sharply
outlined
against
the
glimmering
square
behind
him
he
bent
as
i
watched
him
and
i
heard
the
sharp
turning
of
a
key
and
the
rasping
of
metal
upon
metal
as
if
in
a
dream
i
was
vaguely
conscious
that
this
was
the
japanned
box
which
stood
in
front
of
him
and
that
he
had
drawn
something
out
of
it
something
squat
and
uncouth
which
now
lay
before
him
upon
the
table
i
never
realizedâ€”it
never
occurred
to
my
bemuddled
and
torpid
brain
that
i
was
intruding
upon
his
privacy
that
he
imagined
himself
to
be
alone
in
the
room
and
then
just
as
it
rushed
upon
my
horrified
perceptions
and
i
had
half
risen
to
announce
my
presence
i
heard
a
strange
crisp
metallic
clicking
and
then
the
voice
yes
it
was
a
womanâ€™s
voice
there
could
not
be
a
doubt
of
it
but
a
voice
so
charged
with
entreaty
and
with
yearning
love
that
it
will
ring
for
ever
in
my
ears
it
came
with
a
curious
far-away
tinkle
but
every
word
was
clear
though
faintâ€”very
faint
for
they
were
the
last
words
of
a
dying
woman
â€œi
am
not
really
gone
johnâ€
said
the
thin
gasping
voice
â€œi
am
here
at
your
very
elbow
and
shall
be
until
we
meet
once
more
i
die
happy
to
think
that
morning
and
night
you
will
hear
my
voice
oh
john
be
strong
be
strong
until
we
meet
againâ€
i
say
that
i
had
risen
in
order
to
announce
my
presence
but
i
could
not
do
so
while
the
voice
was
sounding
i
could
only
remain
half
lying
half
sitting
paralyzed
astounded
listening
to
those
yearning
distant
musical
words
and
heâ€”he
was
so
absorbed
that
even
if
i
had
spoken
he
might
not
have
heard
me
but
with
the
silence
of
the
voice
came
my
half
articulated
apologies
and
explanations
he
sprang
across
the
room
switched
on
the
electric
light
and
in
its
white
glare
i
saw
him
his
eyes
gleaming
with
anger
his
face
twisted
with
passion
as
the
hapless
charwoman
may
have
seen
him
weeks
before
â€œmr
colmoreâ€
he
cried
â€œyou
here
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
sirâ€
with
halting
words
i
explained
it
all
my
neuralgia
the
narcotic
my
luckless
sleep
and
singular
awakening
as
he
listened
the
glow
of
anger
faded
from
his
face
and
the
sad
impassive
mask
closed
once
more
over
his
features
â€œmy
secret
is
yours
mr
colmoreâ€
said
he
â€œi
have
only
myself
to
blame
for
relaxing
my
precautions
half
confidences
are
worse
than
no
confidences
and
so
you
may
know
all
since
you
know
so
much
the
story
may
go
where
you
will
when
i
have
passed
away
but
until
then
i
rely
upon
your
sense
of
honour
that
no
human
soul
shall
hear
it
from
your
lips
i
am
proud
stillâ€”god
help
meâ€”or
at
least
i
am
proud
enough
to
resent
that
pity
which
this
story
would
draw
upon
me
i
have
smiled
at
envy
and
disregarded
hatred
but
pity
is
more
than
i
can
tolerate
â€œyou
have
heard
the
source
from
which
the
voice
comesâ€”that
voice
which
has
as
i
understand
excited
so
much
curiosity
in
my
household
i
am
aware
of
the
rumours
to
which
it
has
given
rise
these
speculations
whether
scandalous
or
superstitious
are
such
as
i
can
disregard
and
forgive
what
i
should
never
forgive
would
be
a
disloyal
spying
and
eavesdropping
in
order
to
satisfy
an
illicit
curiosity
but
of
that
mr
colmore
i
acquit
you
â€œwhen
i
was
a
young
man
sir
many
years
younger
than
you
are
now
i
was
launched
upon
town
without
a
friend
or
adviser
and
with
a
purse
which
brought
only
too
many
false
friends
and
false
advisers
to
my
side
i
drank
deeply
of
the
wine
of
lifeâ€”if
there
is
a
man
living
who
has
drank
more
deeply
he
is
not
a
man
whom
i
envy
my
purse
suffered
my
character
suffered
my
constitution
suffered
stimulants
became
a
necessity
to
me
i
was
a
creature
from
whom
my
memory
recoils
and
it
was
at
that
time
the
time
of
my
blackest
degradation
that
god
sent
into
my
life
the
gentlest
sweetest
spirit
that
ever
descended
as
a
ministering
angel
from
above
she
loved
me
broken
as
i
was
loved
me
and
spent
her
life
in
making
a
man
once
more
of
that
which
had
degraded
itself
to
the
level
of
the
beasts
â€œbut
a
fell
disease
struck
her
and
she
withered
away
before
my
eyes
in
the
hour
of
her
agony
it
was
never
of
herself
of
her
own
sufferings
and
her
own
death
that
she
thought
it
was
all
of
me
the
one
pang
which
her
fate
brought
to
her
was
the
fear
that
when
her
influence
was
removed
i
should
revert
to
that
which
i
had
been
it
was
in
vain
that
i
made
oath
to
her
that
no
drop
of
wine
would
ever
cross
my
lips
she
knew
only
too
well
the
hold
that
the
devil
had
upon
meâ€”she
who
had
striven
so
to
loosen
itâ€”and
it
haunted
her
night
and
day
the
thought
that
my
soul
might
again
be
within
his
grip
â€œit
was
from
some
friendâ€™s
gossip
of
the
sick
room
that
she
heard
of
this
inventionâ€”this
phonographâ€”and
with
the
quick
insight
of
a
loving
woman
she
saw
how
she
might
use
it
for
her
ends
she
sent
me
to
london
to
procure
the
best
which
money
could
buy
with
her
dying
breath
she
gasped
into
it
the
words
which
have
held
me
straight
ever
since
lonely
and
broken
what
else
have
i
in
all
the
world
to
uphold
me
but
it
is
enough
please
god
i
shall
face
her
without
shame
when
he
is
pleased
to
reunite
us
that
is
my
secret
mr
colmore
and
whilst
i
live
i
leave
it
in
your
keepingâ€
the
black
doctor
bishopâ€™s
crossing
is
a
small
village
lying
ten
miles
in
a
south-westerly
direction
from
liverpool
here
in
the
early
seventies
there
settled
a
doctor
named
aloysius
lana
nothing
was
known
locally
either
of
his
antecedents
or
of
the
reasons
which
had
prompted
him
to
come
to
this
lancashire
hamlet
two
facts
only
were
certain
about
him
the
one
that
he
had
gained
his
medical
qualification
with
some
distinction
at
glasgow
the
other
that
he
came
undoubtedly
of
a
tropical
race
and
was
so
dark
that
he
might
almost
have
had
a
strain
of
the
indian
in
his
composition
his
predominant
features
were
however
european
and
he
possessed
a
stately
courtesy
and
carriage
which
suggested
a
spanish
extraction
a
swarthy
skin
raven-black
hair
and
dark
sparkling
eyes
under
a
pair
of
heavily-tufted
brows
made
a
strange
contrast
to
the
flaxen
or
chestnut
rustics
of
england
and
the
new-comer
was
soon
known
as
â€œthe
black
doctor
of
bishopâ€™s
crossingâ€
at
first
it
was
a
term
of
ridicule
and
reproach
as
the
years
went
on
it
became
a
title
of
honour
which
was
familiar
to
the
whole
country-side
and
extended
far
beyond
the
narrow
confines
of
the
village
for
the
new-comer
proved
himself
to
be
a
capable
surgeon
and
an
accomplished
physician
the
practice
of
that
district
had
been
in
the
hands
of
edward
rowe
the
son
of
sir
william
rowe
the
liverpool
consultant
but
he
had
not
inherited
the
talents
of
his
father
and
dr
lana
with
his
advantages
of
presence
and
of
manner
soon
beat
him
out
of
the
field
dr
lanaâ€™s
social
success
was
as
rapid
as
his
professional
a
remarkable
surgical
cure
in
the
case
of
the
hon
james
lowry
the
second
son
of
lord
belton
was
the
means
of
introducing
him
to
county
society
where
he
became
a
favourite
through
the
charm
of
his
conversation
and
the
elegance
of
his
manners
an
absence
of
antecedents
and
of
relatives
is
sometimes
an
aid
rather
than
an
impediment
to
social
advancement
and
the
distinguished
individuality
of
the
handsome
doctor
was
its
own
recommendation
his
patients
had
one
faultâ€”and
one
fault
onlyâ€”to
find
with
him
he
appeared
to
be
a
confirmed
bachelor
this
was
the
more
remarkable
since
the
house
which
he
occupied
was
a
large
one
and
it
was
known
that
his
success
in
practice
had
enabled
him
to
save
considerable
sums
at
first
the
local
match-makers
were
continually
coupling
his
name
with
one
or
other
of
the
eligible
ladies
but
as
years
passed
and
dr
lana
remained
unmarried
it
came
to
be
generally
understood
that
for
some
reason
he
must
remain
a
bachelor
some
even
went
so
far
as
to
assert
that
he
was
already
married
and
that
it
was
in
order
to
escape
the
consequence
of
an
early
misalliance
that
he
had
buried
himself
at
bishopâ€™s
crossing
and
then
just
as
the
match-makers
had
finally
given
him
up
in
despair
his
engagement
was
suddenly
announced
to
miss
frances
morton
of
leigh
hall
miss
morton
was
a
young
lady
who
was
well
known
upon
the
country-side
her
father
james
haldane
morton
having
been
the
squire
of
bishopâ€™s
crossing
both
her
parents
were
however
dead
and
she
lived
with
her
only
brother
arthur
morton
who
had
inherited
the
family
estate
in
person
miss
morton
was
tall
and
stately
and
she
was
famous
for
her
quick
impetuous
nature
and
for
her
strength
of
character
she
met
dr
lana
at
a
garden-party
and
a
friendship
which
quickly
ripened
into
love
sprang
up
between
them
nothing
could
exceed
their
devotion
to
each
other
there
was
some
discrepancy
in
age
he
being
thirty-seven
and
she
twenty-four
but
save
in
that
one
respect
there
was
no
possible
objection
to
be
found
with
the
match
the
engagement
was
in
february
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
in
august
upon
the
3rd
of
june
dr
lana
received
a
letter
from
abroad
in
a
small
village
the
postmaster
is
also
in
a
position
to
be
the
gossip-master
and
mr
bankley
of
bishopâ€™s
crossing
had
many
of
the
secrets
of
his
neighbours
in
his
possession
of
this
particular
letter
he
remarked
only
that
it
was
in
a
curious
envelope
that
it
was
in
a
manâ€™s
handwriting
that
the
postscript
was
buenos
ayres
and
the
stamp
of
the
argentine
republic
it
was
the
first
letter
which
he
had
ever
known
dr
lana
to
have
from
abroad
and
this
was
the
reason
why
his
attention
was
particularly
called
to
it
before
he
handed
it
to
the
local
postman
it
was
delivered
by
the
evening
delivery
of
that
date
next
morningâ€”that
is
upon
the
4th
of
juneâ€”dr
lana
called
upon
miss
morton
and
a
long
interview
followed
from
which
he
was
observed
to
return
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
miss
morton
remained
in
her
room
all
that
day
and
her
maid
found
her
several
times
in
tears
in
the
course
of
a
week
it
was
an
open
secret
to
the
whole
village
that
the
engagement
was
at
an
end
that
dr
lana
had
behaved
shamefully
to
the
young
lady
and
that
arthur
morton
her
brother
was
talking
of
horse-whipping
him
in
what
particular
respect
the
doctor
had
behaved
badly
was
unknownâ€”some
surmised
one
thing
and
some
another
but
it
was
observed
and
taken
as
the
obvious
sign
of
a
guilty
conscience
that
he
would
go
for
miles
round
rather
than
pass
the
windows
of
leigh
hall
and
that
he
gave
up
attending
morning
service
upon
sundays
where
he
might
have
met
the
young
lady
there
was
an
advertisement
also
in
the
lancet
as
to
the
sale
of
a
practice
which
mentioned
no
names
but
which
was
thought
by
some
to
refer
to
bishopâ€™s
crossing
and
to
mean
that
dr
lana
was
thinking
of
abandoning
the
scene
of
his
success
such
was
the
position
of
affairs
when
upon
the
evening
of
monday
june
21st
there
came
a
fresh
development
which
changed
what
had
been
a
mere
village
scandal
into
a
tragedy
which
arrested
the
attention
of
the
whole
nation
some
detail
is
necessary
to
cause
the
facts
of
that
evening
to
present
their
full
significance
the
sole
occupants
of
the
doctorâ€™s
house
were
his
housekeeper
an
elderly
and
most
respectable
woman
named
martha
woods
and
a
young
servantâ€”mary
pilling
the
coachman
and
the
surgery-boy
slept
out
it
was
the
custom
of
the
doctor
to
sit
at
night
in
his
study
which
was
next
the
surgery
in
the
wing
of
the
house
which
was
farthest
from
the
servantsâ€™
quarters
this
side
of
the
house
had
a
door
of
its
own
for
the
convenience
of
patients
so
that
it
was
possible
for
the
doctor
to
admit
and
receive
a
visitor
there
without
the
knowledge
of
any
one
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
patients
came
late
it
was
quite
usual
for
him
to
let
them
in
and
out
by
the
surgery
entrance
for
the
maid
and
the
housekeeper
were
in
the
habit
of
retiring
early
on
this
particular
night
martha
woods
went
into
the
doctorâ€™s
study
at
half-past
nine
and
found
him
writing
at
his
desk
she
bade
him
good-night
sent
the
maid
to
bed
and
then
occupied
herself
until
a
quarter
to
eleven
in
household
matters
it
was
striking
eleven
upon
the
hall
clock
when
she
went
to
her
own
room
she
had
been
there
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
twenty
minutes
when
she
heard
a
cry
or
call
which
appeared
to
come
from
within
the
house
she
waited
some
time
but
it
was
not
repeated
much
alarmed
for
the
sound
was
loud
and
urgent
she
put
on
a
dressing-gown
and
ran
at
the
top
of
her
speed
to
the
doctorâ€™s
study
â€œwhoâ€™s
thereâ€
cried
a
voice
as
she
tapped
at
the
door
â€œi
am
here
sirâ€”mrs
woodsâ€
â€œi
beg
that
you
will
leave
me
in
peace
go
back
to
your
room
this
instantâ€
cried
the
voice
which
was
to
the
best
of
her
belief
that
of
her
master
the
tone
was
so
harsh
and
so
unlike
her
masterâ€™s
usual
manner
that
she
was
surprised
and
hurt
â€œi
thought
i
heard
you
calling
sirâ€
she
explained
but
no
answer
was
given
to
her
mrs
woods
looked
at
the
clock
as
she
returned
to
her
room
and
it
was
then
half-past
eleven
at
some
period
between
eleven
and
twelve
she
could
not
be
positive
as
to
the
exact
hour
a
patient
called
upon
the
doctor
and
was
unable
to
get
any
reply
from
him
this
late
visitor
was
mrs
madding
the
wife
of
the
village
grocer
who
was
dangerously
ill
of
typhoid
fever
dr
lana
had
asked
her
to
look
in
the
last
thing
and
let
him
know
how
her
husband
was
progressing
she
observed
that
the
light
was
burning
in
the
study
but
having
knocked
several
times
at
the
surgery
door
without
response
she
concluded
that
the
doctor
had
been
called
out
and
so
returned
home
there
is
a
short
winding
drive
with
a
lamp
at
the
end
of
it
leading
down
from
the
house
to
the
road
as
mrs
madding
emerged
from
the
gate
a
man
was
coming
along
the
footpath
thinking
that
it
might
be
dr
lana
returning
from
some
professional
visit
she
waited
for
him
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
mr
arthur
morton
the
young
squire
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
she
observed
that
his
manner
was
excited
and
that
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
heavy
hunting-crop
he
was
turning
in
at
the
gate
when
she
addressed
him
â€œthe
doctor
is
not
in
sirâ€
said
she
â€œhow
do
you
know
thatâ€
he
asked
harshly
â€œi
have
been
to
the
surgery
door
sirâ€
â€œi
see
a
lightâ€
said
the
young
squire
looking
up
the
drive
â€œthat
is
in
his
study
is
it
notâ€
â€œyes
sir
but
i
am
sure
that
he
is
outâ€
â€œwell
he
must
come
in
againâ€
said
young
morton
and
passed
through
the
gate
while
mrs
madding
went
upon
her
homeward
way
at
three
oâ€™clock
that
morning
her
husband
suffered
a
sharp
relapse
and
she
was
so
alarmed
by
his
symptoms
that
she
determined
to
call
the
doctor
without
delay
as
she
passed
through
the
gate
she
was
surprised
to
see
some
one
lurking
among
the
laurel
bushes
it
was
certainly
a
man
and
to
the
best
of
her
belief
mr
arthur
morton
preoccupied
with
her
own
troubles
she
gave
no
particular
attention
to
the
incident
but
hurried
on
upon
her
errand
when
she
reached
the
house
she
perceived
to
her
surprise
that
the
light
was
still
burning
in
the
study
she
therefore
tapped
at
the
surgery
door
there
was
no
answer
she
repeated
the
knocking
several
times
without
effect
it
appeared
to
her
to
be
unlikely
that
the
doctor
would
either
go
to
bed
or
go
out
leaving
so
brilliant
a
light
behind
him
and
it
struck
mrs
madding
that
it
was
possible
that
he
might
have
dropped
asleep
in
his
chair
she
tapped
at
the
study
window
therefore
but
without
result
then
finding
that
there
was
an
opening
between
the
curtain
and
the
woodwork
she
looked
through
the
small
room
was
brilliantly
lighted
from
a
large
lamp
on
the
central
table
which
was
littered
with
the
doctorâ€™s
books
and
instruments
no
one
was
visible
nor
did
she
see
anything
unusual
except
that
in
the
further
shadow
thrown
by
the
table
a
dingy
white
glove
was
lying
upon
the
carpet
and
then
suddenly
as
her
eyes
became
more
accustomed
to
the
light
a
boot
emerged
from
the
other
end
of
the
shadow
and
she
realized
with
a
thrill
of
horror
that
what
she
had
taken
to
be
a
glove
was
the
hand
of
a
man
who
was
prostrate
upon
the
floor
understanding
that
something
terrible
had
occurred
she
rang
at
the
front
door
roused
mrs
woods
the
housekeeper
and
the
two
women
made
their
way
into
the
study
having
first
dispatched
the
maidservant
to
the
police-station
at
the
side
of
the
table
away
from
the
window
dr
lana
was
discovered
stretched
upon
his
back
and
quite
dead
it
was
evident
that
he
had
been
subjected
to
violence
for
one
of
his
eyes
was
blackened
and
there
were
marks
of
bruises
about
his
face
and
neck
a
slight
thickening
and
swelling
of
his
features
appeared
to
suggest
that
the
cause
of
his
death
had
been
strangulation
he
was
dressed
in
his
usual
professional
clothes
but
wore
cloth
slippers
the
soles
of
which
were
perfectly
clean
the
carpet
was
marked
all
over
especially
on
the
side
of
the
door
with
traces
of
dirty
boots
which
were
presumably
left
by
the
murderer
it
was
evident
that
some
one
had
entered
by
the
surgery
door
had
killed
the
doctor
and
had
then
made
his
escape
unseen
that
the
assailant
was
a
man
was
certain
from
the
size
of
the
footprints
and
from
the
nature
of
the
injuries
but
beyond
that
point
the
police
found
it
very
difficult
to
go
there
were
no
signs
of
robbery
and
the
doctorâ€™s
gold
watch
was
safe
in
his
pocket
he
kept
a
heavy
cash-box
in
the
room
and
this
was
discovered
to
be
locked
but
empty
mrs
woods
had
an
impression
that
a
large
sum
was
usually
kept
there
but
the
doctor
had
paid
a
heavy
corn
bill
in
cash
only
that
very
day
and
it
was
conjectured
that
it
was
to
this
and
not
to
a
robber
that
the
emptiness
of
the
box
was
due
one
thing
in
the
room
was
missingâ€”but
that
one
thing
was
suggestive
the
portrait
of
miss
morton
which
had
always
stood
upon
the
side-table
had
been
taken
from
its
frame
and
carried
off
mrs
woods
had
observed
it
there
when
she
waited
upon
her
employer
that
evening
and
now
it
was
gone
on
the
other
hand
there
was
picked
up
from
the
floor
a
green
eye-patch
which
the
housekeeper
could
not
remember
to
have
seen
before
such
a
patch
might
however
be
in
the
possession
of
a
doctor
and
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
it
was
in
any
way
connected
with
the
crime
suspicion
could
only
turn
in
one
direction
and
arthur
morton
the
young
squire
was
immediately
arrested
the
evidence
against
him
was
circumstantial
but
damning
he
was
devoted
to
his
sister
and
it
was
shown
that
since
the
rupture
between
her
and
dr
lana
he
had
been
heard
again
and
again
to
express
himself
in
the
most
vindictive
terms
towards
her
former
lover
he
had
as
stated
been
seen
somewhere
about
eleven
oâ€™clock
entering
the
doctorâ€™s
drive
with
a
hunting-crop
in
his
hand
he
had
then
according
to
the
theory
of
the
police
broken
in
upon
the
doctor
whose
exclamation
of
fear
or
of
anger
had
been
loud
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
mrs
woods
when
mrs
woods
descended
dr
lana
had
made
up
his
mind
to
talk
it
over
with
his
visitor
and
had
therefore
sent
his
housekeeper
back
to
her
room
this
conversation
had
lasted
a
long
time
had
become
more
and
more
fiery
and
had
ended
by
a
personal
struggle
in
which
the
doctor
lost
his
life
the
fact
revealed
by
a
post-mortem
that
his
heart
was
much
diseasedâ€”an
ailment
quite
unsuspected
during
his
lifeâ€”would
make
it
possible
that
death
might
in
his
case
ensue
from
injuries
which
would
not
be
fatal
to
a
healthy
man
arthur
morton
had
then
removed
his
sisterâ€™s
photograph
and
had
made
his
way
homeward
stepping
aside
into
the
laurel
bushes
to
avoid
mrs
madding
at
the
gate
this
was
the
theory
of
the
prosecution
and
the
case
which
they
presented
was
a
formidable
one
on
the
other
hand
there
were
some
strong
points
for
the
defence
morton
was
high-spirited
and
impetuous
like
his
sister
but
he
was
respected
and
liked
by
everyone
and
his
frank
and
honest
nature
seemed
to
be
incapable
of
such
a
crime
his
own
explanation
was
that
he
was
anxious
to
have
a
conversation
with
dr
lana
about
some
urgent
family
matters
from
first
to
last
he
refused
even
to
mention
the
name
of
his
sister
he
did
not
attempt
to
deny
that
this
conversation
would
probably
have
been
of
an
unpleasant
nature
he
had
heard
from
a
patient
that
the
doctor
was
out
and
he
therefore
waited
until
about
three
in
the
morning
for
his
return
but
as
he
had
seen
nothing
of
him
up
to
that
hour
he
had
given
it
up
and
had
returned
home
as
to
his
death
he
knew
no
more
about
it
than
the
constable
who
arrested
him
he
had
formerly
been
an
intimate
friend
of
the
deceased
man
but
circumstances
which
he
would
prefer
not
to
mention
had
brought
about
a
change
in
his
sentiments
there
were
several
facts
which
supported
his
innocence
it
was
certain
that
dr
lana
was
alive
and
in
his
study
at
half-past
eleven
oâ€™clock
mrs
woods
was
prepared
to
swear
that
it
was
at
that
hour
that
she
had
heard
his
voice
the
friends
of
the
prisoner
contended
that
it
was
probable
that
at
that
time
dr
lana
was
not
alone
the
sound
which
had
originally
attracted
the
attention
of
the
housekeeper
and
her
masterâ€™s
unusual
impatience
that
she
should
leave
him
in
peace
seemed
to
point
to
that
if
this
were
so
then
it
appeared
to
be
probable
that
he
had
met
his
end
between
the
moment
when
the
housekeeper
heard
his
voice
and
the
time
when
mrs
madding
made
her
first
call
and
found
it
impossible
to
attract
his
attention
but
if
this
were
the
time
of
his
death
then
it
was
certain
that
mr
arthur
morton
could
not
be
guilty
as
it
was
after
this
that
she
had
met
the
young
squire
at
the
gate
if
this
hypothesis
were
correct
and
someone
was
with
dr
lana
before
mrs
madding
met
mr
arthur
morton
then
who
was
this
someone
and
what
motives
had
he
for
wishing
evil
to
the
doctor
it
was
universally
admitted
that
if
the
friends
of
the
accused
could
throw
light
upon
this
they
would
have
gone
a
long
way
towards
establishing
his
innocence
but
in
the
meanwhile
it
was
open
to
the
public
to
sayâ€”as
they
did
sayâ€”that
there
was
no
proof
that
any
one
had
been
there
at
all
except
the
young
squire
while
on
the
other
hand
there
was
ample
proof
that
his
motives
in
going
were
of
a
sinister
kind
when
mrs
madding
called
the
doctor
might
have
retired
to
his
room
or
he
might
as
she
thought
at
the
time
have
gone
out
and
returned
afterwards
to
find
mr
arthur
morton
waiting
for
him
some
of
the
supporters
of
the
accused
laid
stress
upon
the
fact
that
the
photograph
of
his
sister
frances
which
had
been
removed
from
the
doctorâ€™s
room
had
not
been
found
in
her
brotherâ€™s
possession
this
argument
however
did
not
count
for
much
as
he
had
ample
time
before
his
arrest
to
burn
it
or
to
destroy
it
as
to
the
only
positive
evidence
in
the
caseâ€”the
muddy
footmarks
upon
the
floorâ€”they
were
so
blurred
by
the
softness
of
the
carpet
that
it
was
impossible
to
make
any
trustworthy
deduction
from
them
the
most
that
could
be
said
was
that
their
appearance
was
not
inconsistent
with
the
theory
that
they
were
made
by
the
accused
and
it
was
further
shown
that
his
boots
were
very
muddy
upon
that
night
there
had
been
a
heavy
shower
in
the
afternoon
and
all
boots
were
probably
in
the
same
condition
such
is
a
bald
statement
of
the
singular
and
romantic
series
of
events
which
centred
public
attention
upon
this
lancashire
tragedy
the
unknown
origin
of
the
doctor
his
curious
and
distinguished
personality
the
position
of
the
man
who
was
accused
of
the
murder
and
the
love
affair
which
had
preceded
the
crime
all
combined
to
make
the
affair
one
of
those
dramas
which
absorb
the
whole
interest
of
a
nation
throughout
the
three
kingdoms
men
discussed
the
case
of
the
black
doctor
of
bishopâ€™s
crossing
and
many
were
the
theories
put
forward
to
explain
the
facts
but
it
may
safely
be
said
that
among
them
all
there
was
not
one
which
prepared
the
minds
of
the
public
for
the
extraordinary
sequel
which
caused
so
much
excitement
upon
the
first
day
of
the
trial
and
came
to
a
climax
upon
the
second
the
long
files
of
the
lancaster
weekly
with
their
report
of
the
case
lie
before
me
as
i
write
but
i
must
content
myself
with
a
synopsis
of
the
case
up
to
the
point
when
upon
the
evening
of
the
first
day
the
evidence
of
miss
frances
morton
threw
a
singular
light
upon
the
case
mr
porlock
carr
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
had
marshalled
his
facts
with
his
usual
skill
and
as
the
day
wore
on
it
became
more
and
more
evident
how
difficult
was
the
task
which
mr
humphrey
who
had
been
retained
for
the
defence
had
before
him
several
witnesses
were
put
up
to
swear
to
the
intemperate
expressions
which
the
young
squire
had
been
heard
to
utter
about
the
doctor
and
the
fiery
manner
in
which
he
resented
the
alleged
ill-treatment
of
his
sister
mrs
madding
repeated
her
evidence
as
to
the
visit
which
had
been
paid
late
at
night
by
the
prisoner
to
the
deceased
and
it
was
shown
by
another
witness
that
the
prisoner
was
aware
that
the
doctor
was
in
the
habit
of
sitting
up
alone
in
this
isolated
wing
of
the
house
and
that
he
had
chosen
this
very
late
hour
to
call
because
he
knew
that
his
victim
would
then
be
at
his
mercy
a
servant
at
the
squireâ€™s
house
was
compelled
to
admit
that
he
had
heard
his
master
return
about
three
that
morning
which
corroborated
mrs
maddingâ€™s
statement
that
she
had
seen
him
among
the
laurel
bushes
near
the
gate
upon
the
occasion
of
her
second
visit
the
muddy
boots
and
an
alleged
similarity
in
the
footprints
were
duly
dwelt
upon
and
it
was
felt
when
the
case
for
the
prosecution
had
been
presented
that
however
circumstantial
it
might
be
it
was
none
the
less
so
complete
and
so
convincing
that
the
fate
of
the
prisoner
was
sealed
unless
something
quite
unexpected
should
be
disclosed
by
the
defence
it
was
three
oâ€™clock
when
the
prosecution
closed
at
half-past
four
when
the
court
rose
a
new
and
unlooked
for
development
had
occurred
i
extract
the
incident
or
part
of
it
from
the
journal
which
i
have
already
mentioned
omitting
the
preliminary
observations
of
the
counsel
considerable
sensation
was
caused
in
the
crowded
court
when
the
first
witness
called
for
the
defence
proved
to
be
miss
frances
morton
the
sister
of
the
prisoner
our
readers
will
remember
that
the
young
lady
had
been
engaged
to
dr
lana
and
that
it
was
his
anger
over
the
sudden
termination
of
this
engagement
which
was
thought
to
have
driven
her
brother
to
the
perpetration
of
this
crime
miss
morton
had
not
however
been
directly
implicated
in
the
case
in
any
way
either
at
the
inquest
or
at
the
police-court
proceedings
and
her
appearance
as
the
leading
witness
for
the
defence
came
as
a
surprise
upon
the
public
miss
frances
morton
who
was
a
tall
and
handsome
brunette
gave
her
evidence
in
a
low
but
clear
voice
though
it
was
evident
throughout
that
she
was
suffering
from
extreme
emotion
she
alluded
to
her
engagement
to
the
doctor
touched
briefly
upon
its
termination
which
was
due
she
said
to
personal
matters
connected
with
his
family
and
surprised
the
court
by
asserting
that
she
had
always
considered
her
brotherâ€™s
resentment
to
be
unreasonable
and
intemperate
in
answer
to
a
direct
question
from
her
counsel
she
replied
that
she
did
not
feel
that
she
had
any
grievance
whatever
against
dr
lana
and
that
in
her
opinion
he
had
acted
in
a
perfectly
honourable
manner
her
brother
on
an
insufficient
knowledge
of
the
facts
had
taken
another
view
and
she
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
in
spite
of
her
entreaties
he
had
uttered
threats
of
personal
violence
against
the
doctor
and
had
upon
the
evening
of
the
tragedy
announced
his
intention
of
â€œhaving
it
out
with
himâ€
she
had
done
her
best
to
bring
him
to
a
more
reasonable
frame
of
mind
but
he
was
very
headstrong
where
his
emotions
or
prejudices
were
concerned
up
to
this
point
the
young
ladyâ€™s
evidence
had
appeared
to
make
against
the
prisoner
rather
than
in
his
favour
the
questions
of
her
counsel
however
soon
put
a
very
different
light
upon
the
matter
and
disclosed
an
unexpected
line
of
defence
mr
humphrey
do
you
believe
your
brother
to
be
guilty
of
this
crime
the
judge
i
cannot
permit
that
question
mr
humphrey
we
are
here
to
decide
upon
questions
of
factâ€”not
of
belief
mr
humphrey
do
you
know
that
your
brother
is
not
guilty
of
the
death
of
doctor
lana
miss
morton
yes
mr
humphrey
how
do
you
know
it
miss
morton
because
dr
lana
is
not
dead
there
followed
a
prolonged
sensation
in
court
which
interrupted
the
cross-examination
of
the
witness
mr
humphrey
and
how
do
you
know
miss
morton
that
dr
lana
is
not
dead
miss
morton
because
i
have
received
a
letter
from
him
since
the
date
of
his
supposed
death
mr
humphrey
have
you
this
letter
miss
morton
yes
but
i
should
prefer
not
to
show
it
mr
humphrey
have
you
the
envelope
miss
morton
yes
it
is
here
mr
humphrey
what
is
the
post-mark
miss
morton
liverpool
mr
humphrey
and
the
date
miss
morton
june
the
22nd
mr
humphrey
that
being
the
day
after
his
alleged
death
are
you
prepared
to
swear
to
this
handwriting
miss
morton
miss
morton
certainly
mr
humphrey
i
am
prepared
to
call
six
other
witnesses
my
lord
to
testify
that
this
letter
is
in
the
writing
of
doctor
lana
the
judge
then
you
must
call
them
to-morrow
mr
porlock
carr
counsel
for
the
prosecution
in
the
meantime
my
lord
we
claim
possession
of
this
document
so
that
we
may
obtain
expert
evidence
as
to
how
far
it
is
an
imitation
of
the
handwriting
of
the
gentleman
whom
we
still
confidently
assert
to
be
deceased
i
need
not
point
out
that
the
theory
so
unexpectedly
sprung
upon
us
may
prove
to
be
a
very
obvious
device
adopted
by
the
friends
of
the
prisoner
in
order
to
divert
this
inquiry
i
would
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
young
lady
must
according
to
her
own
account
have
possessed
this
letter
during
the
proceedings
at
the
inquest
and
at
the
police-court
she
desires
us
to
believe
that
she
permitted
these
to
proceed
although
she
held
in
her
pocket
evidence
which
would
at
any
moment
have
brought
them
to
an
end
mr
humphrey
can
you
explain
this
miss
morton
miss
morton
dr
lana
desired
his
secret
to
be
preserved
mr
porlock
carr
then
why
have
you
made
this
public
miss
morton
to
save
my
brother
a
murmur
of
sympathy
broke
out
in
court
which
was
instantly
suppressed
by
the
judge
the
judge
admitting
this
line
of
defence
it
lies
with
you
mr
humphrey
to
throw
a
light
upon
who
this
man
is
whose
body
has
been
recognised
by
so
many
friends
and
patients
of
dr
lana
as
being
that
of
the
doctor
himself
a
juryman
has
any
one
up
to
now
expressed
any
doubt
about
the
matter
mr
porlock
carr
not
to
my
knowledge
mr
humphrey
we
hope
to
make
the
matter
clear
the
judge
then
the
court
adjourns
until
to-morrow





this
new
development
of
the
case
excited
the
utmost
interest
among
the
general
public
press
comment
was
prevented
by
the
fact
that
the
trial
was
still
undecided
but
the
question
was
everywhere
argued
as
to
how
far
there
could
be
truth
in
miss
mortonâ€™s
declaration
and
how
far
it
might
be
a
daring
ruse
for
the
purpose
of
saving
her
brother
the
obvious
dilemma
in
which
the
missing
doctor
stood
was
that
if
by
any
extraordinary
chance
he
was
not
dead
then
he
must
be
held
responsible
for
the
death
of
this
unknown
man
who
resembled
him
so
exactly
and
who
was
found
in
his
study
this
letter
which
miss
morton
refused
to
produce
was
possibly
a
confession
of
guilt
and
she
might
find
herself
in
the
terrible
position
of
only
being
able
to
save
her
brother
from
the
gallows
by
the
sacrifice
of
her
former
lover
the
court
next
morning
was
crammed
to
overflowing
and
a
murmur
of
excitement
passed
over
it
when
mr
humphrey
was
observed
to
enter
in
a
state
of
emotion
which
even
his
trained
nerves
could
not
conceal
and
to
confer
with
the
opposing
counsel
a
few
hurried
wordsâ€”words
which
left
a
look
of
amazement
upon
mr
porlock
carrâ€™s
faceâ€”passed
between
them
and
then
the
counsel
for
the
defence
addressing
the
judge
announced
that
with
the
consent
of
the
prosecution
the
young
lady
who
had
given
evidence
upon
the
sitting
before
would
not
be
recalled





the
judge
but
you
appear
mr
humphrey
to
have
left
matters
in
a
very
unsatisfactory
state
mr
humphrey
perhaps
my
lord
my
next
witness
may
help
to
clear
them
up
the
judge
then
call
your
next
witness
mr
humphrey
i
call
dr
aloysius
lana
the
learned
counsel
has
made
many
telling
remarks
in
his
day
but
he
has
certainly
never
produced
such
a
sensation
with
so
short
a
sentence
the
court
was
simply
stunned
with
amazement
as
the
very
man
whose
fate
had
been
the
subject
of
so
much
contention
appeared
bodily
before
them
in
the
witness-box
those
among
the
spectators
who
had
known
him
at
bishopâ€™s
crossing
saw
him
now
gaunt
and
thin
with
deep
lines
of
care
upon
his
face
but
in
spite
of
his
melancholy
bearing
and
despondent
expression
there
were
few
who
could
say
that
they
had
ever
seen
a
man
of
more
distinguished
presence
bowing
to
the
judge
he
asked
if
he
might
be
allowed
to
make
a
statement
and
having
been
duly
informed
that
whatever
he
said
might
be
used
against
him
he
bowed
once
more
and
proceededâ€”
â€œmy
wishâ€
said
he
â€œis
to
hold
nothing
back
but
to
tell
with
perfect
frankness
all
that
occurred
upon
the
night
of
the
21st
of
june
had
i
known
that
the
innocent
had
suffered
and
that
so
much
trouble
had
been
brought
upon
those
whom
i
love
best
in
the
world
i
should
have
come
forward
long
ago
but
there
were
reasons
which
prevented
these
things
from
coming
to
my
ears
it
was
my
desire
that
an
unhappy
man
should
vanish
from
the
world
which
had
known
him
but
i
had
not
foreseen
that
others
would
be
affected
by
my
actions
let
me
to
the
best
of
my
ability
repair
the
evil
which
i
have
done
â€œto
any
one
who
is
acquainted
with
the
history
of
the
argentine
republic
the
name
of
lana
is
well
known
my
father
who
came
of
the
best
blood
of
old
spain
filled
all
the
highest
offices
of
the
state
and
would
have
been
president
but
for
his
death
in
the
riots
of
san
juan
a
brilliant
career
might
have
been
open
to
my
twin
brother
ernest
and
myself
had
it
not
been
for
financial
losses
which
made
it
necessary
that
we
should
earn
our
own
living
i
apologize
sir
if
these
details
appear
to
be
irrelevant
but
they
are
a
necessary
introduction
to
that
which
is
to
follow
â€œi
had
as
i
have
said
a
twin
brother
named
ernest
whose
resemblance
to
me
was
so
great
that
even
when
we
were
together
people
could
see
no
difference
between
us
down
to
the
smallest
detail
we
were
exactly
the
same
as
we
grew
older
this
likeness
became
less
marked
because
our
expression
was
not
the
same
but
with
our
features
in
repose
the
points
of
difference
were
very
slight
â€œit
does
not
become
me
to
say
too
much
of
one
who
is
dead
the
more
so
as
he
is
my
only
brother
but
i
leave
his
character
to
those
who
knew
him
best
i
will
only
sayâ€”for
i
have
to
say
itâ€”that
in
my
early
manhood
i
conceived
a
horror
of
him
and
that
i
had
good
reason
for
the
aversion
which
filled
me
my
own
reputation
suffered
from
his
actions
for
our
close
resemblance
caused
me
to
be
credited
with
many
of
them
eventually
in
a
peculiarly
disgraceful
business
he
contrived
to
throw
the
whole
odium
upon
me
in
such
a
way
that
i
was
forced
to
leave
the
argentine
for
ever
and
to
seek
a
career
in
europe
the
freedom
from
his
hated
presence
more
than
compensated
me
for
the
loss
of
my
native
land
i
had
enough
money
to
defray
my
medical
studies
at
glasgow
and
i
finally
settled
in
practice
at
bishopâ€™s
crossing
in
the
firm
conviction
that
in
that
remote
lancashire
hamlet
i
should
never
hear
of
him
again
â€œfor
years
my
hopes
were
fulfilled
and
then
at
last
he
discovered
me
some
liverpool
man
who
visited
buenos
ayres
put
him
upon
my
track
he
had
lost
all
his
money
and
he
thought
that
he
would
come
over
and
share
mine
knowing
my
horror
of
him
he
rightly
thought
that
i
would
be
willing
to
buy
him
off
i
received
a
letter
from
him
saying
that
he
was
coming
it
was
at
a
crisis
in
my
own
affairs
and
his
arrival
might
conceivably
bring
trouble
and
even
disgrace
upon
some
whom
i
was
especially
bound
to
shield
from
anything
of
the
kind
i
took
steps
to
insure
that
any
evil
which
might
come
should
fall
on
me
only
and
thatâ€â€”here
he
turned
and
looked
at
the
prisonerâ€”â€œwas
the
cause
of
conduct
upon
my
part
which
has
been
too
harshly
judged
my
only
motive
was
to
screen
those
who
were
dear
to
me
from
any
possible
connection
with
scandal
or
disgrace
that
scandal
and
disgrace
would
come
with
my
brother
was
only
to
say
that
what
had
been
would
be
again
â€œmy
brother
arrived
himself
one
night
not
very
long
after
my
receipt
of
the
letter
i
was
sitting
in
my
study
after
the
servants
had
gone
to
bed
when
i
heard
a
footstep
upon
the
gravel
outside
and
an
instant
later
i
saw
his
face
looking
in
at
me
through
the
window
he
was
a
clean-shaven
man
like
myself
and
the
resemblance
between
us
was
still
so
great
that
for
an
instant
i
thought
it
was
my
own
reflection
in
the
glass
he
had
a
dark
patch
over
his
eye
but
our
features
were
absolutely
the
same
then
he
smiled
in
a
sardonic
way
which
had
been
a
trick
of
his
from
his
boyhood
and
i
knew
that
he
was
the
same
brother
who
had
driven
me
from
my
native
land
and
brought
disgrace
upon
what
had
been
an
honourable
name
i
went
to
the
door
and
i
admitted
him
that
would
be
about
ten
oâ€™clock
that
night
â€œwhen
he
came
into
the
glare
of
the
lamp
i
saw
at
once
that
he
had
fallen
upon
very
evil
days
he
had
walked
from
liverpool
and
he
was
tired
and
ill
i
was
quite
shocked
by
the
expression
upon
his
face
my
medical
knowledge
told
me
that
there
was
some
serious
internal
malady
he
had
been
drinking
also
and
his
face
was
bruised
as
the
result
of
a
scuffle
which
he
had
had
with
some
sailors
it
was
to
cover
his
injured
eye
that
he
wore
this
patch
which
he
removed
when
he
entered
the
room
he
was
himself
dressed
in
a
pea-jacket
and
flannel
shirt
and
his
feet
were
bursting
through
his
boots
but
his
poverty
had
only
made
him
more
savagely
vindictive
towards
me
his
hatred
rose
to
the
height
of
a
mania
i
had
been
rolling
in
money
in
england
according
to
his
account
while
he
had
been
starving
in
south
america
i
cannot
describe
to
you
the
threats
which
he
uttered
or
the
insults
which
he
poured
upon
me
my
impression
is
that
hardships
and
debauchery
had
unhinged
his
reason
he
paced
about
the
room
like
a
wild
beast
demanding
drink
demanding
money
and
all
in
the
foulest
language
i
am
a
hot-tempered
man
but
i
thank
god
that
i
am
able
to
say
that
i
remained
master
of
myself
and
that
i
never
raised
a
hand
against
him
my
coolness
only
irritated
him
the
more
he
raved
he
cursed
he
shook
his
fists
in
my
face
and
then
suddenly
a
horrible
spasm
passed
over
his
features
he
clapped
his
hand
to
his
side
and
with
a
loud
cry
he
fell
in
a
heap
at
my
feet
i
raised
him
up
and
stretched
him
upon
the
sofa
but
no
answer
came
to
my
exclamations
and
the
hand
which
i
held
in
mine
was
cold
and
clammy
his
diseased
heart
had
broken
down
his
own
violence
had
killed
him
â€œfor
a
long
time
i
sat
as
if
i
were
in
some
dreadful
dream
staring
at
the
body
of
my
brother
i
was
aroused
by
the
knocking
of
mrs
woods
who
had
been
disturbed
by
that
dying
cry
i
sent
her
away
to
bed
shortly
afterwards
a
patient
tapped
at
the
surgery
door
but
as
i
took
no
notice
he
or
she
went
off
again
slowly
and
gradually
as
i
sat
there
a
plan
was
forming
itself
in
my
head
in
the
curious
automatic
way
in
which
plans
do
form
when
i
rose
from
my
chair
my
future
movements
were
finally
decided
upon
without
my
having
been
conscious
of
any
process
of
thought
it
was
an
instinct
which
irresistibly
inclined
me
towards
one
course
â€œever
since
that
change
in
my
affairs
to
which
i
have
alluded
bishopâ€™s
crossing
had
become
hateful
to
me
my
plans
of
life
had
been
ruined
and
i
had
met
with
hasty
judgments
and
unkind
treatment
where
i
had
expected
sympathy
it
is
true
that
any
danger
of
scandal
from
my
brother
had
passed
away
with
his
life
but
still
i
was
sore
about
the
past
and
felt
that
things
could
never
be
as
they
had
been
it
may
be
that
i
was
unduly
sensitive
and
that
i
had
not
made
sufficient
allowance
for
others
but
my
feelings
were
as
i
describe
any
chance
of
getting
away
from
bishopâ€™s
crossing
and
of
everyone
in
it
would
be
most
welcome
to
me
and
here
was
such
a
chance
as
i
could
never
have
dared
to
hope
for
a
chance
which
would
enable
me
to
make
a
clean
break
with
the
past
â€œthere
was
this
dead
man
lying
upon
the
sofa
so
like
me
that
save
for
some
little
thickness
and
coarseness
of
the
features
there
was
no
difference
at
all
no
one
had
seen
him
come
and
no
one
would
miss
him
we
were
both
clean
shaven
and
his
hair
was
about
the
same
length
as
my
own
if
i
changed
clothes
with
him
then
dr
aloysius
lana
would
be
found
lying
dead
in
his
study
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
an
unfortunate
fellow
and
of
a
blighted
career
there
was
plenty
of
ready
money
in
the
room
and
this
i
could
carry
away
with
me
to
help
me
to
start
once
more
in
some
other
land
in
my
brotherâ€™s
clothes
i
could
walk
by
night
unobserved
as
far
as
liverpool
and
in
that
great
seaport
i
would
soon
find
some
means
of
leaving
the
country
after
my
lost
hopes
the
humblest
existence
where
i
was
unknown
was
far
preferable
in
my
estimation
to
a
practice
however
successful
in
bishopâ€™s
crossing
where
at
any
moment
i
might
come
face
to
face
with
those
whom
i
should
wish
if
it
were
possible
to
forget
i
determined
to
effect
the
change
â€œand
i
did
so
i
will
not
go
into
particulars
for
the
recollection
is
as
painful
as
the
experience
but
in
an
hour
my
brother
lay
dressed
down
to
the
smallest
detail
in
my
clothes
while
i
slunk
out
by
the
surgery
door
and
taking
the
back
path
which
led
across
some
fields
i
started
off
to
make
the
best
of
my
way
to
liverpool
where
i
arrived
the
same
night
my
bag
of
money
and
a
certain
portrait
were
all
i
carried
out
of
the
house
and
i
left
behind
me
in
my
hurry
the
shade
which
my
brother
had
been
wearing
over
his
eye
everything
else
of
his
i
took
with
me
â€œi
give
you
my
word
sir
that
never
for
one
instant
did
the
idea
occur
to
me
that
people
might
think
that
i
had
been
murdered
nor
did
i
imagine
that
any
one
might
be
caused
serious
danger
through
this
stratagem
by
which
i
endeavoured
to
gain
a
fresh
start
in
the
world
on
the
contrary
it
was
the
thought
of
relieving
others
from
the
burden
of
my
presence
which
was
always
uppermost
in
my
mind
a
sailing
vessel
was
leaving
liverpool
that
very
day
for
corunna
and
in
this
i
took
my
passage
thinking
that
the
voyage
would
give
me
time
to
recover
my
balance
and
to
consider
the
future
but
before
i
left
my
resolution
softened
i
bethought
me
that
there
was
one
person
in
the
world
to
whom
i
would
not
cause
an
hour
of
sadness
she
would
mourn
me
in
her
heart
however
harsh
and
unsympathetic
her
relatives
might
be
she
understood
and
appreciated
the
motives
upon
which
i
had
acted
and
if
the
rest
of
her
family
condemned
me
she
at
least
would
not
forget
and
so
i
sent
her
a
note
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
to
save
her
from
a
baseless
grief
if
under
the
pressure
of
events
she
broke
that
seal
she
has
my
entire
sympathy
and
forgiveness
â€œit
was
only
last
night
that
i
returned
to
england
and
during
all
this
time
i
have
heard
nothing
of
the
sensation
which
my
supposed
death
had
caused
nor
of
the
accusation
that
mr
arthur
morton
had
been
concerned
in
it
it
was
in
a
late
evening
paper
that
i
read
an
account
of
the
proceedings
of
yesterday
and
i
have
come
this
morning
as
fast
as
an
express
train
could
bring
me
to
testify
to
the
truthâ€
such
was
the
remarkable
statement
of
dr
aloysius
lana
which
brought
the
trial
to
a
sudden
termination
a
subsequent
investigation
corroborated
it
to
the
extent
of
finding
out
the
vessel
in
which
his
brother
ernest
lana
had
come
over
from
south
america
the
shipâ€™s
doctor
was
able
to
testify
that
he
had
complained
of
a
weak
heart
during
the
voyage
and
that
his
symptoms
were
consistent
with
such
a
death
as
was
described
as
to
dr
aloysius
lana
he
returned
to
the
village
from
which
he
had
made
so
dramatic
a
disappearance
and
a
complete
reconciliation
was
effected
between
him
and
the
young
squire
the
latter
having
acknowledged
that
he
had
entirely
misunderstood
the
otherâ€™s
motives
in
withdrawing
from
his
engagement
that
another
reconciliation
followed
may
be
judged
from
a
notice
extracted
from
a
prominent
column
in
the
morning
postâ€”
a
marriage
was
solemnized
upon
september
19th
by
the
rev
stephen
johnson
at
the
parish
church
of
bishopâ€™s
crossing
between
aloysius
xavier
lana
son
of
don
alfredo
lana
formerly
foreign
minister
of
the
argentine
republic
and
frances
morton
only
daughter
of
the
late
james
morton
jp
of
leigh
hall
bishopâ€™s
crossing
lancashire
playing
with
fire
i
cannot
pretend
to
say
what
occurred
on
the
14th
of
april
last
at
no
17
badderly
gardens
put
down
in
black
and
white
my
surmise
might
seem
too
crude
too
grotesque
for
serious
consideration
and
yet
that
something
did
occur
and
that
it
was
of
a
nature
which
will
leave
its
mark
upon
every
one
of
us
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
is
as
certain
as
the
unanimous
testimony
of
five
witnesses
can
make
it
i
will
not
enter
into
any
argument
or
speculation
i
will
only
give
a
plain
statement
which
will
be
submitted
to
john
moir
harvey
deacon
and
mrs
delamere
and
withheld
from
publication
unless
they
are
prepared
to
corroborate
every
detail
i
cannot
obtain
the
sanction
of
paul
le
duc
for
he
appears
to
have
left
the
country
it
was
john
moir
the
well-known
senior
partner
of
moir
moir
and
sanderson
who
had
originally
turned
our
attention
to
occult
subjects
he
had
like
many
very
hard
and
practical
men
of
business
a
mystic
side
to
his
nature
which
had
led
him
to
the
examination
and
eventually
to
the
acceptance
of
those
elusive
phenomena
which
are
grouped
together
with
much
that
is
foolish
and
much
that
is
fraudulent
under
the
common
heading
of
spiritualism
his
researches
which
had
begun
with
an
open
mind
ended
unhappily
in
dogma
and
he
became
as
positive
and
fanatical
as
any
other
bigot
he
represented
in
our
little
group
the
body
of
men
who
have
turned
these
singular
phenomena
into
a
new
religion
mrs
delamere
our
medium
was
his
sister
the
wife
of
delamere
the
rising
sculptor
our
experience
had
shown
us
that
to
work
on
these
subjects
without
a
medium
was
as
futile
as
for
an
astronomer
to
make
observations
without
a
telescope
on
the
other
hand
the
introduction
of
a
paid
medium
was
hateful
to
all
of
us
was
it
not
obvious
that
he
or
she
would
feel
bound
to
return
some
result
for
money
received
and
that
the
temptation
to
fraud
would
be
an
overpowering
one
no
phenomena
could
be
relied
upon
which
were
produced
at
a
guinea
an
hour
but
fortunately
moir
had
discovered
that
his
sister
was
mediumisticâ€”in
other
words
that
she
was
a
battery
of
that
animal
magnetic
force
which
is
the
only
form
of
energy
which
is
subtle
enough
to
be
acted
upon
from
the
spiritual
plane
as
well
as
from
our
own
material
one
of
course
when
i
say
this
i
do
not
mean
to
beg
the
question
but
i
am
simply
indicating
the
theories
upon
which
we
were
ourselves
rightly
or
wrongly
explaining
what
we
saw
the
lady
came
not
altogether
with
the
approval
of
her
husband
and
though
she
never
gave
indications
of
any
very
great
psychic
force
we
were
able
at
least
to
obtain
those
usual
phenomena
of
message-tilting
which
are
at
the
same
time
so
puerile
and
so
inexplicable
every
sunday
evening
we
met
in
harvey
deaconâ€™s
studio
at
badderly
gardens
the
next
house
to
the
corner
of
merton
park
road
harvey
deaconâ€™s
imaginative
work
in
art
would
prepare
any
one
to
find
that
he
was
an
ardent
lover
of
everything
which
was
outrã©
and
sensational
a
certain
picturesqueness
in
the
study
of
the
occult
had
been
the
quality
which
had
originally
attracted
him
to
it
but
his
attention
was
speedily
arrested
by
some
of
those
phenomena
to
which
i
have
referred
and
he
was
coming
rapidly
to
the
conclusion
that
what
he
had
looked
upon
as
an
amusing
romance
and
an
after-dinner
entertainment
was
really
a
very
formidable
reality
he
is
a
man
with
a
remarkably
clear
and
logical
brainâ€”a
true
descendant
of
his
ancestor
the
well-known
scotch
professorâ€”and
he
represented
in
our
small
circle
the
critical
element
the
man
who
has
no
prejudices
is
prepared
to
follow
facts
as
far
as
he
can
see
them
and
refuses
to
theorize
in
advance
of
his
data
his
caution
annoyed
moir
as
much
as
the
latterâ€™s
robust
faith
amused
deacon
but
each
in
his
own
way
was
equally
keen
upon
the
matter
and
i
what
am
i
to
say
that
i
represented
i
was
not
the
devotee
i
was
not
the
scientific
critic
perhaps
the
best
that
i
can
claim
for
myself
is
that
i
was
the
dilettante
man
about
town
anxious
to
be
in
the
swim
of
every
fresh
movement
thankful
for
any
new
sensation
which
would
take
me
out
of
myself
and
open
up
fresh
possibilities
of
existence
i
am
not
an
enthusiast
myself
but
i
like
the
company
of
those
who
are
moirâ€™s
talk
which
made
me
feel
as
if
we
had
a
private
pass-key
through
the
door
of
death
filled
me
with
a
vague
contentment
the
soothing
atmosphere
of
the
sã©ance
with
the
darkened
lights
was
delightful
to
me
in
a
word
the
thing
amused
me
and
so
i
was
there
it
was
as
i
have
said
upon
the
14th
of
april
last
that
the
very
singular
event
which
i
am
about
to
put
upon
record
took
place
i
was
the
first
of
the
men
to
arrive
at
the
studio
but
mrs
delamere
was
already
there
having
had
afternoon
tea
with
mrs
harvey
deacon
the
two
ladies
and
deacon
himself
were
standing
in
front
of
an
unfinished
picture
of
his
upon
the
easel
i
am
not
an
expert
in
art
and
i
have
never
professed
to
understand
what
harvey
deacon
meant
by
his
pictures
but
i
could
see
in
this
instance
that
it
was
all
very
clever
and
imaginative
fairies
and
animals
and
allegorical
figures
of
all
sorts
the
ladies
were
loud
in
their
praises
and
indeed
the
colour
effect
was
a
remarkable
one
â€œwhat
do
you
think
of
it
markhamâ€
he
asked
â€œwell
itâ€™s
above
meâ€
said
i
â€œthese
beastsâ€”what
are
theyâ€
â€œmythical
monsters
imaginary
creatures
heraldic
emblemsâ€”a
sort
of
weird
bizarre
procession
of
themâ€
â€œwith
a
white
horse
in
frontâ€
â€œitâ€™s
not
a
horseâ€
said
he
rather
testilyâ€”which
was
surprising
for
he
was
a
very
good-humoured
fellow
as
a
rule
and
hardly
ever
took
himself
seriously
â€œwhat
is
it
thenâ€
â€œcanâ€™t
you
see
the
horn
in
front
itâ€™s
a
unicorn
i
told
you
they
were
heraldic
beasts
canâ€™t
you
recognize
oneâ€
â€œvery
sorry
deaconâ€
said
i
for
he
really
seemed
to
be
annoyed
he
laughed
at
his
own
irritation
â€œexcuse
me
markhamâ€
said
he
â€œthe
fact
is
that
i
have
had
an
awful
job
over
the
beast
all
day
i
have
been
painting
him
in
and
painting
him
out
and
trying
to
imagine
what
a
real
live
ramping
unicorn
would
look
like
at
last
i
got
him
as
i
hoped
so
when
you
failed
to
recognize
it
it
took
me
on
the
rawâ€
â€œwhy
of
course
itâ€™s
a
unicornâ€
said
i
for
he
was
evidently
depressed
at
my
obtuseness
â€œi
can
see
the
horn
quite
plainly
but
i
never
saw
a
unicorn
except
beside
the
royal
arms
and
so
i
never
thought
of
the
creature
and
these
others
are
griffins
and
cockatrices
and
dragons
of
sortsâ€
â€œyes
i
had
no
difficulty
with
them
it
was
the
unicorn
which
bothered
me
however
thereâ€™s
an
end
of
it
until
to-morrowâ€
he
turned
the
picture
round
upon
the
easel
and
we
all
chatted
about
other
subjects
moir
was
late
that
evening
and
when
he
did
arrive
he
brought
with
him
rather
to
our
surprise
a
small
stout
frenchman
whom
he
introduced
as
monsieur
paul
le
duc
i
say
to
our
surprise
for
we
held
a
theory
that
any
intrusion
into
our
spiritual
circle
deranged
the
conditions
and
introduced
an
element
of
suspicion
we
knew
that
we
could
trust
each
other
but
all
our
results
were
vitiated
by
the
presence
of
an
outsider
however
moir
soon
reconciled
us
to
the
innovation
monsieur
paul
le
duc
was
a
famous
student
of
occultism
a
seer
a
medium
and
a
mystic
he
was
travelling
in
england
with
a
letter
of
introduction
to
moir
from
the
president
of
the
parisian
brothers
of
the
rosy
cross
what
more
natural
than
that
he
should
bring
him
to
our
little
sã©ance
or
that
we
should
feel
honoured
by
his
presence
he
was
as
i
have
said
a
small
stout
man
undistinguished
in
appearance
with
a
broad
smooth
clean-shaven
face
remarkable
only
for
a
pair
of
large
brown
velvety
eyes
staring
vaguely
out
in
front
of
him
he
was
well
dressed
with
the
manners
of
a
gentleman
and
his
curious
little
turns
of
english
speech
set
the
ladies
smiling
mrs
deacon
had
a
prejudice
against
our
researches
and
left
the
room
upon
which
we
lowered
the
lights
as
was
our
custom
and
drew
up
our
chairs
to
the
square
mahogany
table
which
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
studio
the
light
was
subdued
but
sufficient
to
allow
us
to
see
each
other
quite
plainly
i
remember
that
i
could
even
observe
the
curious
podgy
little
square-topped
hands
which
the
frenchman
laid
upon
the
table
â€œwhat
a
funâ€
said
he
â€œit
is
many
years
since
i
have
sat
in
this
fashion
and
it
is
to
me
amusing
madame
is
medium
does
madame
make
the
tranceâ€
â€œwell
hardly
thatâ€
said
mrs
delamere
â€œbut
i
am
always
conscious
of
extreme
sleepinessâ€
â€œit
is
the
first
stage
then
you
encourage
it
and
there
comes
the
trance
when
the
trance
comes
then
out
jumps
your
little
spirit
and
in
jumps
another
little
spirit
and
so
you
have
direct
talking
or
writing
you
leave
your
machine
to
be
worked
by
another
hein
but
what
have
unicorns
to
do
with
itâ€
harvey
deacon
started
in
his
chair
the
frenchman
was
moving
his
head
slowly
round
and
staring
into
the
shadows
which
draped
the
walls
â€œwhat
a
funâ€
said
he
â€œalways
unicorns
who
has
been
thinking
so
hard
upon
a
subject
so
bizarreâ€
â€œthis
is
wonderfulâ€
cried
deacon
â€œi
have
been
trying
to
paint
one
all
day
but
how
could
you
know
itâ€
â€œyou
have
been
thinking
of
them
in
this
roomâ€
â€œcertainlyâ€
â€œbut
thoughts
are
things
my
friend
when
you
imagine
a
thing
you
make
a
thing
you
did
not
know
it
hein
but
i
can
see
your
unicorns
because
it
is
not
only
with
my
eye
that
i
can
seeâ€
â€œdo
you
mean
to
say
that
i
create
a
thing
which
has
never
existed
by
merely
thinking
of
itâ€
â€œbut
certainly
it
is
the
fact
which
lies
under
all
other
facts
that
is
why
an
evil
thought
is
also
a
dangerâ€
â€œthey
are
i
suppose
upon
the
astral
planeâ€
said
moir
â€œah
well
these
are
but
words
my
friends
they
are
thereâ€”somewhereâ€”everywhereâ€”i
cannot
tell
myself
i
see
them
i
could
not
touch
themâ€
â€œyou
could
not
make
us
see
themâ€
â€œit
is
to
materialize
them
hold
it
is
an
experiment
but
the
power
is
wanting
let
us
see
what
power
we
have
and
then
arrange
what
we
shall
do
may
i
place
you
as
i
should
wishâ€
â€œyou
evidently
know
a
great
deal
more
about
it
than
we
doâ€
said
harvey
deacon
â€œi
wish
that
you
would
take
complete
controlâ€
â€œit
may
be
that
the
conditions
are
not
good
but
we
will
try
what
we
can
do
madame
will
sit
where
she
is
i
next
and
this
gentleman
beside
me
meester
moir
will
sit
next
to
madame
because
it
is
well
to
have
blacks
and
blondes
in
turn
so
and
now
with
your
permission
i
will
turn
the
lights
all
outâ€
â€œwhat
is
the
advantage
of
the
darkâ€
i
asked
â€œbecause
the
force
with
which
we
deal
is
a
vibration
of
ether
and
so
also
is
light
we
have
the
wires
all
for
ourselves
nowâ€”hein
you
will
not
be
frightened
in
the
darkness
madame
what
a
fun
is
such
a
sã©anceâ€
at
first
the
darkness
appeared
to
be
absolutely
pitchy
but
in
a
few
minutes
our
eyes
became
so
far
accustomed
to
it
that
we
could
just
make
out
each
otherâ€™s
presenceâ€”very
dimly
and
vaguely
it
is
true
i
could
see
nothing
else
in
the
roomâ€”only
the
black
loom
of
the
motionless
figures
we
were
all
taking
the
matter
much
more
seriously
than
we
had
ever
done
before
â€œyou
will
place
your
hands
in
front
it
is
hopeless
that
we
touch
since
we
are
so
few
round
so
large
a
table
you
will
compose
yourself
madame
and
if
sleep
should
come
to
you
you
will
not
fight
against
it
and
now
we
sit
in
silence
and
we
expectâ€”â€”heinâ€
so
we
sat
in
silence
and
expected
staring
out
into
the
blackness
in
front
of
us
a
clock
ticked
in
the
passage
a
dog
barked
intermittently
far
away
once
or
twice
a
cab
rattled
past
in
the
street
and
the
gleam
of
its
lamps
through
the
chink
in
the
curtains
was
a
cheerful
break
in
that
gloomy
vigil
i
felt
those
physical
symptoms
with
which
previous
sã©ances
had
made
me
familiarâ€”the
coldness
of
the
feet
the
tingling
in
the
hands
the
glow
of
the
palms
the
feeling
of
a
cold
wind
upon
the
back
strange
little
shooting
pains
came
in
my
forearms
especially
as
it
seemed
to
me
in
my
left
one
which
was
nearest
to
our
visitorâ€”due
no
doubt
to
disturbance
of
the
vascular
system
but
worthy
of
some
attention
all
the
same
at
the
same
time
i
was
conscious
of
a
strained
feeling
of
expectancy
which
was
almost
painful
from
the
rigid
absolute
silence
of
my
companions
i
gathered
that
their
nerves
were
as
tense
as
my
own
and
then
suddenly
a
sound
came
out
of
the
darknessâ€”a
low
sibilant
sound
the
quick
thin
breathing
of
a
woman
quicker
and
thinner
yet
it
came
as
between
clenched
teeth
to
end
in
a
loud
gasp
with
a
dull
rustle
of
cloth
â€œwhatâ€™s
that
is
all
rightâ€
someone
asked
in
the
darkness
â€œyes
all
is
rightâ€
said
the
frenchman
â€œit
is
madame
she
is
in
her
trance
now
gentlemen
if
you
will
wait
quiet
you
will
see
something
i
think
which
will
interest
you
muchâ€
still
the
ticking
in
the
hall
still
the
breathing
deeper
and
fuller
now
from
the
medium
still
the
occasional
flash
more
welcome
than
ever
of
the
passing
lights
of
the
hansoms
what
a
gap
we
were
bridging
the
half-raised
veil
of
the
eternal
on
the
one
side
and
the
cabs
of
london
on
the
other
the
table
was
throbbing
with
a
mighty
pulse
it
swayed
steadily
rhythmically
with
an
easy
swooping
scooping
motion
under
our
fingers
sharp
little
raps
and
cracks
came
from
its
substance
file-firing
volley-firing
the
sounds
of
a
fagot
burning
briskly
on
a
frosty
night
â€œthere
is
much
powerâ€
said
the
frenchman
â€œsee
it
on
the
tableâ€
i
had
thought
it
was
some
delusion
of
my
own
but
all
could
see
it
now
there
was
a
greenish-yellow
phosphorescent
lightâ€”or
i
should
say
a
luminous
vapour
rather
than
a
lightâ€”which
lay
over
the
surface
of
the
table
it
rolled
and
wreathed
and
undulated
in
dim
glimmering
folds
turning
and
swirling
like
clouds
of
smoke
i
could
see
the
white
square-ended
hands
of
the
french
medium
in
this
baleful
light
â€œwhat
a
funâ€
he
cried
â€œit
is
splendidâ€
â€œshall
we
call
the
alphabetâ€
asked
moir
â€œbut
noâ€”for
we
can
do
much
betterâ€
said
our
visitor
â€œit
is
but
a
clumsy
thing
to
tilt
the
table
for
every
letter
of
the
alphabet
and
with
such
a
medium
as
madame
we
should
do
better
than
thatâ€
â€œyes
you
will
do
betterâ€
said
a
voice
â€œwho
was
that
who
spoke
was
that
you
markhamâ€
â€œno
i
did
not
speakâ€
â€œit
was
madame
who
spokeâ€
â€œbut
it
was
not
her
voiceâ€
â€œis
that
you
mrs
delamereâ€
â€œit
is
not
the
medium
but
it
is
the
power
which
uses
the
organs
of
the
mediumâ€
said
the
strange
deep
voice
â€œwhere
is
mrs
delamere
it
will
not
hurt
her
i
trustâ€
â€œthe
medium
is
happy
in
another
plane
of
existence
she
has
taken
my
place
as
i
have
taken
hersâ€
â€œwho
are
youâ€
â€œit
cannot
matter
to
you
who
i
am
i
am
one
who
has
lived
as
you
are
living
and
who
has
died
as
you
will
dieâ€
we
heard
the
creak
and
grate
of
a
cab
pulling
up
next
door
there
was
an
argument
about
the
fare
and
the
cabman
grumbled
hoarsely
down
the
street
the
green-yellow
cloud
still
swirled
faintly
over
the
table
dull
elsewhere
but
glowing
into
a
dim
luminosity
in
the
direction
of
the
medium
it
seemed
to
be
piling
itself
up
in
front
of
her
a
sense
of
fear
and
cold
struck
into
my
heart
it
seemed
to
me
that
lightly
and
flippantly
we
had
approached
the
most
real
and
august
of
sacraments
that
communion
with
the
dead
of
which
the
fathers
of
the
church
had
spoken
â€œdonâ€™t
you
think
we
are
going
too
far
should
we
not
break
up
this
sã©anceâ€
i
cried
but
the
others
were
all
earnest
to
see
the
end
of
it
they
laughed
at
my
scruples
â€œall
the
powers
are
made
for
useâ€
said
harvey
deacon
â€œif
we
can
do
this
we
should
do
this
every
new
departure
of
knowledge
has
been
called
unlawful
in
its
inception
it
is
right
and
proper
that
we
should
inquire
into
the
nature
of
deathâ€
â€œit
is
right
and
properâ€
said
the
voice
â€œthere
what
more
could
you
askâ€
cried
moir
who
was
much
excited
â€œlet
us
have
a
test
will
you
give
us
a
test
that
you
are
really
thereâ€
â€œwhat
test
do
you
demandâ€
â€œwell
nowâ€”i
have
some
coins
in
my
pocket
will
you
tell
me
how
manyâ€
â€œwe
come
back
in
the
hope
of
teaching
and
of
elevating
and
not
to
guess
childish
riddlesâ€
â€œha
ha
meester
moir
you
catch
it
that
timeâ€
cried
the
frenchman
â€œbut
surely
this
is
very
good
sense
what
the
control
is
sayingâ€
â€œit
is
a
religion
not
a
gameâ€
said
the
cold
hard
voice
â€œexactlyâ€”the
very
view
i
take
of
itâ€
cried
moir
â€œi
am
sure
i
am
very
sorry
if
i
have
asked
a
foolish
question
you
will
not
tell
me
who
you
areâ€
â€œwhat
does
it
matterâ€
â€œhave
you
been
a
spirit
longâ€
â€œyesâ€
â€œhow
longâ€
â€œwe
cannot
reckon
time
as
you
do
our
conditions
are
differentâ€
â€œare
you
happyâ€
â€œyesâ€
â€œyou
would
not
wish
to
come
back
to
lifeâ€
â€œnoâ€”certainly
notâ€
â€œare
you
busyâ€
â€œwe
could
not
be
happy
if
we
were
not
busyâ€
â€œwhat
do
you
doâ€
â€œi
have
said
that
the
conditions
are
entirely
differentâ€
â€œcan
you
give
us
no
idea
of
your
workâ€
â€œwe
labour
for
our
own
improvement
and
for
the
advancement
of
othersâ€
â€œdo
you
like
coming
here
to-nightâ€
â€œi
am
glad
to
come
if
i
can
do
any
good
by
comingâ€
â€œthen
to
do
good
is
your
objectâ€
â€œit
is
the
object
of
all
life
on
every
planeâ€
â€œyou
see
markham
that
should
answer
your
scruplesâ€
it
did
for
my
doubts
had
passed
and
only
interest
remained
â€œhave
you
pain
in
your
lifeâ€
i
asked
â€œno
pain
is
a
thing
of
the
bodyâ€
â€œhave
you
mental
painâ€
â€œyes
one
may
always
be
sad
or
anxiousâ€
â€œdo
you
meet
the

you
have
known
on
earthâ€
â€œsome
of
themâ€
â€œwhy
only
some
of
themâ€
â€œonly
those
who
are
sympatheticâ€
â€œdo
husbands
meet

â€œthose
who
have
truly
lovedâ€
â€œand
the
othersâ€
â€œthey
are
nothing
to
each

â€œthere
must
be
a
spiritual
connectionâ€
â€œof

â€œis
what
we
are
doing
rightâ€
â€œif
done
in

â€œwhat

â€œcuriosity
and
levityâ€
â€œmay
harm

â€œvery
serious

â€œwhat

â€œyou
may
call
up

over
which
you
have
no
controlâ€
â€œevil
forcesâ€
â€œundeveloped
forcesâ€
â€œyou
say
they
are
dangerous
dangerous
to
body
or
mindâ€
â€œsometimes
to
bothâ€
there
was
a
pause
and
the
blackness
seemed
to
grow
blacker
still
while
the
yellow-green
fog
swirled
and
smoked
upon
the
table
â€œany
questions
you
would
like
to
ask
moirâ€
said
harvey
deacon
â€œonly
thisâ€”do
you
pray
in
your
worldâ€
â€œone
should
pray
in
every
worldâ€
â€œwhyâ€
â€œbecause
it
is
the
acknowledgment
of
forces
outside
ourselvesâ€
â€œwhat
religion
do
you
hold
over
thereâ€
â€œwe
differ
exactly
as
you
doâ€
â€œyou
have
no
certain
knowledgeâ€
â€œwe
have
only
faithâ€
â€œthese
questions
of
religionâ€
said
the
frenchman
â€œthey
are
of
interest
to
you
serious
english
people
but
they
are
not
so
much
fun
it
seems
to
me
that
with
this
power
here
we
might
be
able
to
have
some
great
experienceâ€”hein
something
of
which
we
could
talkâ€
â€œbut
nothing
could
be
more
interesting
than
thisâ€
said
moir
â€œwell
if
you
think
so
that
is
very
wellâ€
the
frenchman
answered
peevishly
â€œfor
my
part
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
heard
all
this
before
and
that
to-night
i
should
weesh
to
try
some
experiment
with
all
this
force
which
is
given
to
us
but
if
you
have
other
questions
then
ask
them
and
when
you
are
finish
we
can
try
something
moreâ€
but
the
spell
was
broken
we
asked
and
asked
but
the
medium
sat
silent
in
her
chair
only
her
deep
regular
breathing
showed
that
she
was
there
the
mist
still
swirled
upon
the
table
â€œyou
have
disturbed
the
harmony
she
will
not
answerâ€
â€œbut
we
have
learned
already
all
that
she
can
tellâ€”hein
for
my
part
i
wish
to
see
something
that
i
have
never
seen
beforeâ€
â€œwhat
thenâ€
â€œyou
will
let
me
tryâ€
â€œwhat
would
you
doâ€
â€œi
have
said
to
you
that
thoughts
are
things
now
i
wish
to
prove
it
to
you
and
to
show
you
that
which
is
only
a
thought
yes
yes
i
can
do
it
and
you
will
see
now
i
ask
you
only
to
sit
still
and
say
nothing
and
keep
ever
your
hands
quiet
upon
the
tableâ€
the
room
was
blacker
and
more
silent
than
ever
the
same
feeling
of
apprehension
which
had
lain
heavily
upon
me
at
the
beginning
of
the
sã©ance
was
back
at
my
heart
once
more
the
roots
of
my
hair
were
tingling
â€œit
is
working
it
is
workingâ€
cried
the
frenchman
and
there
was
a
crack
in
his
voice
as
he
spoke
which
told
me
that
he
also
was
strung
to
his
tightest
the
luminous
fog
drifted
slowly
off
the
table
and
wavered
and
flickered
across
the
room
there
in
the
farther
and
darkest
corner
it
gathered
and
glowed
hardening
down
into
a
shining
coreâ€”a
strange
shifty
luminous
and
yet
non-illuminating
patch
of
radiance
bright
itself
but
throwing
no
rays
into
the
darkness
it
had
changed
from
a
greenish-yellow
to
a
dusky
sullen
red
then
round
this
centre
there
coiled
a
dark
smoky
substance
thickening
hardening
growing
denser
and
blacker
and
then
the
light
went
out
smothered
in
that
which
had
grown
round
it
â€œit
has
goneâ€
â€œhushâ€”thereâ€™s
something
in
the
roomâ€
we
heard
it
in
the
corner
where
the
light
had
been
something
which
breathed
deeply
and
fidgeted
in
the
darkness
â€œwhat
is
it
le
duc
what
have
you
doneâ€
â€œit
is
all
right
no
harm
will
comeâ€
the
frenchmanâ€™s
voice
was
treble
with
agitation
â€œgood
heavens
moir
thereâ€™s
a
large
animal
in
the
room
here
it
is
close
by
my
chair
go
away
go
awayâ€
it
was
harvey
deaconâ€™s
voice
and
then
came
the
sound
of
a
blow
upon
some
hard
object
and
then

and
then

how
can
i
tell
you
what
happened
then
some
huge
thing
hurtled
against
us
in
the
darkness
rearing
stamping
smashing
springing
snorting
the
table
was
splintered
we
were
scattered
in
every
direction
it
clattered
and
scrambled
amongst
us
rushing
with
horrible
energy
from
one
corner
of
the
room
to
another
we
were
all
screaming
with
fear
grovelling
upon
our
hands
and
knees
to
get
away
from
it
something
trod
upon
my
left
hand
and
i
felt
the
bones
splinter
under
the
weight
â€œa
light
a
lightâ€
someone
yelled
â€œmoir
you
have
matches
matchesâ€
â€œno
i
have
none
deacon
where
are
the
matches
for
godâ€™s
sake
the
matchesâ€
â€œi
canâ€™t
find
them
here
you
frenchman
stop
itâ€
â€œit
is
beyond
me
oh
mon
dieu
i
cannot
stop
it
the
door
where
is
the
doorâ€
my
hand
by
good
luck
lit
upon
the
handle
as
i
groped
about
in
the
darkness
the
hard-breathing
snorting
rushing
creature
tore
past
me
and
butted
with
a
fearful
crash
against
the
oaken
partition
the
instant
that
it
had
passed
i
turned
the
handle
and
next
moment
we
were
all
outside
and
the
door
shut
behind
us
from
within
came
a
horrible
crashing
and
rending
and
stamping
â€œwhat
is
it
in
heavenâ€™s
name
what
is
itâ€
â€œa
horse
i
saw
it
when
the
door
opened
but
mrs
delamereâ€”â€”â€
â€œwe
must
fetch
her
out
come
on
markham
the
longer
we
wait
the
less
we
shall
like
itâ€
he
flung
open
the
door
and
we
rushed
in
she
was
there
on
the
ground
amidst
the
splinters
of
her
chair
we
seized
her
and
dragged
her
swiftly
out
and
as
we
gained
the
door
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
into
the
darkness
there
were
two
strange
eyes
glowing
at
us
a
rattle
of
hoofs
and
i
had
just
time
to
slam
the
door
when
there
came
a
crash
upon
it
which
split
it
from
top
to
bottom
â€œitâ€™s
coming
through
itâ€™s
comingâ€
â€œrun
run
for
your
livesâ€
cried
the
frenchman
another
crash
and
something
shot
through
the
riven
door
it
was
a
long
white
spike
gleaming
in
the
lamplight
for
a
moment
it
shone
before
us
and
then
with
a
snap
it
disappeared
again
â€œquick
quick
this
wayâ€
harvey
deacon
shouted
â€œcarry
her
in
here
quickâ€
we
had
taken
refuge
in
the
dining-room
and
shut
the
heavy
oak
door
we
laid
the
senseless
woman
upon
the
sofa
and
as
we
did
so
moir
the
hard
man
of
business
drooped
and
fainted
across
the
hearthrug
harvey
deacon
was
as
white
as
a
corpse
jerking
and
twitching
like
an
epileptic
with
a
crash
we
heard
the
studio
door
fly
to
pieces
and
the
snorting
and
stamping
were
in
the
passage
up
and
down
up
and
down
shaking
the
house
with
their
fury
the
frenchman
had
sunk
his
face
on
his
hands
and
sobbed
like
a
frightened
child
â€œwhat
shall
we
doâ€
i
shook
him
roughly
by
the
shoulder
â€œis
a
gun
any
useâ€
â€œno
no
the
power
will
pass
then
it
will
endâ€
â€œyou
might
have
killed
us
allâ€”you
unspeakable
foolâ€”with
your
infernal
experimentsâ€
â€œi
did
not
know
how
could
i
tell
that
it
would
be
frightened
it
is
mad
with
terror
it
was
his
fault
he
struck
itâ€
harvey
deacon
sprang
up
â€œgood
heavensâ€
he
cried
a
terrible
scream
sounded
through
the
house
â€œitâ€™s
my
wife
here
iâ€™m
going
out
if
itâ€™s
the
evil
one
himself
i
am
going
outâ€
he
had
thrown
open
the
door
and
rushed
out
into
the
passage
at
the
end
of
it
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
mrs
deacon
was
lying
senseless
struck
down
by
the
sight
which
she
had
seen
but
there
was
nothing
else
with
eyes
of
horror
we
looked
about
us
but
all
was
perfectly
quiet
and
still
i
approached
the
black
square
of
the
studio
door
expecting
with
every
slow
step
that
some
atrocious
shape
would
hurl
itself
out
of
it
but
nothing
came
and
all
was
silent
inside
the
room
peeping
and
peering
our
hearts
in
our
mouths
we
came
to
the
very
threshold
and
stared
into
the
darkness
there
was
still
no
sound
but
in
one
direction
there
was
also
no
darkness
a
luminous
glowing
cloud
with
an
incandescent
centre
hovered
in
the
corner
of
the
room
slowly
it
dimmed
and
faded
growing
thinner
and
fainter
until
at
last
the
same
dense
velvety
blackness
filled
the
whole
studio
and
with
the
last
flickering
gleam
of
that
baleful
light
the
frenchman
broke
into
a
shout
of
joy
â€œwhat
a
funâ€
he
cried
â€œno
one
is
hurt
and
only
the
door
broken
and
the
ladies
frightened
but
my
friends
we
have
done
what
has
never
been
done
beforeâ€
â€œand
as
far
as
i
can
help
itâ€
said
harvey
deacon
â€œit
will
certainly
never
be
done
againâ€
and
that
was
what
befell
on
the
14th
of
april
last
at
no
17
badderly
gardens
i
began
by
saying
that
it
would
seem
too
grotesque
to
dogmatize
as
to
what
it
was
which
actually
did
occur
but
i
give
my
impressions
our
impressions
since
they
are
corroborated
by
harvey
deacon
and
john
moir
for
what
they
are
worth
you
may
if
it
pleases
you
imagine
that
we
were
the
victims
of
an
elaborate
and
extraordinary
hoax
or
you
may
think
with
us
that
we
underwent
a
very
real
and
a
very
terrible
experience
or
perhaps
you
may
know
more
than
we
do
of
such
occult
matters
and
can
inform
us
of
some
similar
occurrence
in
this
latter
case
a
letter
to
william
markham
146m
the
albany
would
help
to
throw
a
light
upon
that
which
is
very
dark
to
us
the
jewâ€™s
breastplate
my
particular
friend
ward
mortimer
was
one
of
the
best
men
of
his
day
at
everything
connected
with
oriental
archã¦ology
he
had
written
largely
upon
the
subject
he
had
lived
two
years
in
a
tomb
at
thebes
while
he
excavated
in
the
valley
of
the
kings
and
finally
he
had
created
a
considerable
sensation
by
his
exhumation
of
the
alleged
mummy
of
cleopatra
in
the
inner
room
of
the
temple
of
horus
at
philã¦
with
such
a
record
at
the
age
of
thirty-one
it
was
felt
that
a
considerable
career
lay
before
him
and
no
one
was
surprised
when
he
was
elected
to
the
curatorship
of
the
belmore
street
museum
which
carries
with
it
the
lectureship
at
the
oriental
college
and
an
income
which
has
sunk
with
the
fall
in
land
but
which
still
remains
at
that
ideal
sum
which
is
large
enough
to
encourage
an
investigator
but
not
so
large
as
to
enervate
him
there
was
only
one
reason
which
made
ward
mortimerâ€™s
position
a
little
difficult
at
the
belmore
street
museum
and
that
was
the
extreme
eminence
of
the
man
whom
he
had
to
succeed
professor
andreas
was
a
profound
scholar
and
a
man
of
european
reputation
his
lectures
were
frequented
by
students
from
every
part
of
the
world
and
his
admirable
management
of
the
collection
intrusted
to
his
care
was
a
commonplace
in
all
learned
societies
there
was
therefore
considerable
surprise
when
at
the
age
of
fifty-five
he
suddenly
resigned
his
position
and
retired
from
those
duties
which
had
been
both
his
livelihood
and
his
pleasure
he
and
his
daughter
left
the
comfortable
suite
of
rooms
which
had
formed
his
official
residence
in
connection
with
the
museum
and
my
friend
mortimer
who
was
a
bachelor
took
up
his
quarters
there
on
hearing
of
mortimerâ€™s
appointment
professor
andreas
had
written
him
a
very
kindly
and
flattering
congratulatory
letter
i
was
actually
present
at
their
first
meeting
and
i
went
with
mortimer
round
the
museum
when
the
professor
showed
us
the
admirable
collection
which
he
had
cherished
so
long
the
professorâ€™s
beautiful
daughter
and
a
young
man
captain
wilson
who
was
as
i
understood
soon
to
be
her
husband
accompanied
us
in
our
inspection
there
were
fifteen
rooms
but
the
babylonian
the
syrian
and
the
central
hall
which
contained
the
jewish
and
egyptian
collection
were
the
finest
of
all
professor
andreas
was
a
quiet
dry
elderly
man
with
a
clean-shaven
face
and
an
impassive
manner
but
his
dark
eyes
sparkled
and
his
features
quickened
into
enthusiastic
life
as
he
pointed
out
to
us
the
rarity
and
the
beauty
of
some
of
his
specimens
his
hand
lingered
so
fondly
over
them
that
one
could
read
his
pride
in
them
and
the
grief
in
his
heart
now
that
they
were
passing
from
his
care
into
that
of
another
he
had
shown
us
in
turn
his
mummies
his
papyri
his
rare
scarabs
his
inscriptions
his
jewish
relics
and
his
duplication
of
the
famous
seven-branched
candlestick
of
the
temple
which
was
brought
to
rome
by
titus
and
which
is
supposed
by
some
to
be
lying
at
this
instant
in
the
bed
of
the
tiber
then
he
approached
a
case
which
stood
in
the
very
centre
of
the
hall
and
he
looked
down
through
the
glass
with
reverence
in
his
attitude
and
manner
â€œthis
is
no
novelty
to
an
expert
like
yourself
mr
mortimerâ€
said
he
â€œbut
i
daresay
that
your
friend
mr
jackson
will
be
interested
to
see
itâ€
leaning
over
the
case
i
saw
an
object
some
five
inches
square
which
consisted
of
twelve
precious
stones
in
a
framework
of
gold
with
golden
hooks
at
two
of
the
corners
the
stones
were
all
varying
in
sort
and
colour
but
they
were
of
the
same
size
their
shapes
arrangement
and
gradation
of
tint
made
me
think
of
a
box
of
water-colour
paints
each
stone
had
some
hieroglyphic
scratched
upon
its
surface
â€œyou
have
heard
mr
jackson
of
the
urim
and
thummimâ€
i
had
heard
the
term
but
my
idea
of
its
meaning
was
exceedingly
vague
â€œthe
urim
and
thummim
was
a
name
given
to
the
jewelled
plate
which
lay
upon
the
breast
of
the
high
priest
of
the
jews
they
had
a
very
special
feeling
of
reverence
for
itâ€”something
of
the
feeling
which
an
ancient
roman
might
have
for
the
sibylline
books
in
the
capitol
there
are
as
you
see
twelve
magnificent
stones
inscribed
with
mystical
characters
counting
from
the
left-hand
top
corner
the
stones
are
carnelian
peridot
emerald
ruby
lapis
lazuli
onyx
sapphire
agate
amethyst
topaz
beryl
and
jasperâ€
i
was
amazed
at
the
variety
and
beauty
of
the
stones
â€œhas
the
breastplate
any
particular
historyâ€
i
asked
â€œit
is
of
great
age
and
of
immense
valueâ€
said
professor
andreas
â€œwithout
being
able
to
make
an
absolute
assertion
we
have
many
reasons
to
think
that
it
is
possible
that
it
may
be
the
original
urim
and
thummim
of
solomonâ€™s
temple
there
is
certainly
nothing
so
fine
in
any
collection
in
europe
my
friend
captain
wilson
here
is
a
practical
authority
upon
precious
stones
and
he
would
tell
you
how
pure
these
areâ€
captain
wilson
a
man
with
a
dark
hard
incisive
face
was
standing
beside
his
fiancã©e
at
the
other
side
of
the
case
â€œyesâ€
said
he
curtly
â€œi
have
never
seen
finer
stonesâ€
â€œand
the
gold-work
is
also
worthy
of
attention
the
ancients
excelled
in
â€”â€”â€â€”he
was
apparently
about
to
indicate
the
setting
of
the
stones
when
captain
wilson
interrupted
him
â€œyou
will
see
a
finer
example
of
their
gold-work
in
this
candlestickâ€
said
he
turning
to
another
table
and
we
all
joined
him
in
his
admiration
of
its
embossed
stem
and
delicately
ornamented
branches
altogether
it
was
an
interesting
and
a
novel
experience
to
have
objects
of
such
rarity
explained
by
so
great
an
expert
and
when
finally
professor
andreas
finished
our
inspection
by
formally
handing
over
the
precious
collection
to
the
care
of
my
friend
i
could
not
help
pitying
him
and
envying
his
successor
whose
life
was
to
pass
in
so
pleasant
a
duty
within
a
week
ward
mortimer
was
duly
installed
in
his
new
set
of
rooms
and
had
become
the
autocrat
of
the
belmore
street
museum
about
a
fortnight
afterwards
my
friend
gave
a
small
dinner
to
half-a-dozen
bachelor
friends
to
celebrate
his
promotion
when
his
guests
were
departing
he
pulled
my
sleeve
and
signalled
to
me
that
he
wished
me
to
remain
â€œyou
have
only
a
few
hundred
yards
to
goâ€
said
heâ€”i
was
living
in
chambers
in
the
albany
â€œyou
may
as
well
stay
and
have
a
quiet
cigar
with
me
i
very
much
want
your
adviceâ€
i
relapsed
into
an
arm-chair
and
lit
one
of
his
excellent
matronas
when
he
had
returned
from
seeing
the
last
of
his
guests
out
he
drew
a
letter
from
his
dress-jacket
and
sat
down
opposite
to
me
â€œthis
is
an
anonymous
letter
which
i
received
this
morningâ€
said
he
â€œi
want
to
read
it
to
you
and
to
have
your
adviceâ€
â€œyou
are
very
welcome
to
it
for
what
it
is
worthâ€
â€œthis
is
how
the
note
runs
â€˜sirâ€”i
should
strongly
advise
you
to
keep
a
very
careful
watch
over
the
many
valuable
things
which
are
committed
to
your
charge
i
do
not
think
that
the
present
system
of
a
single
watchman
is
sufficient
be
upon
your
guard
or
an
irreparable
misfortune
may
occurâ€
â€œis
that
allâ€
â€œyes
that
is
allâ€
â€œwellâ€
said
i
â€œit
is
at
least
obvious
that
it
was
written
by
one
of
the
limited
number
of
people
who
are
aware
that
you
have
only
one
watchman
at
nightâ€
ward
mortimer
handed
me
the
note
with
a
curious
smile
â€œhave
you
an
eye
for
handwritingâ€
said
he
â€œnow
look
at
thisâ€
he
put
another
letter
in
front
of
me
â€œlook
at
the
c
in
â€˜congratulateâ€™
and
the
c
in
â€˜committedâ€™
look
at
the
capital
i
look
at
the
trick
of
putting
in
a
dash
instead
of
a
stopâ€
â€œthey
are
undoubtedly
from
the
same
handâ€”with
some
attempt
at
disguise
in
the
case
of
this
first
oneâ€
â€œthe
secondâ€
said
ward
mortimer
â€œis
the
letter
of
congratulation
which
was
written
to
me
by
professor
andreas
upon
my
obtaining
my
appointmentâ€
i
stared
at
him
in
amazement
then
i
turned
over
the
letter
in
my
hand
and
there
sure
enough
was
â€œmartin
andreasâ€
signed
upon
the
other
side
there
could
be
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
any
one
who
had
the
slightest
knowledge
of
the
science
of
graphology
that
the
professor
had
written
an
anonymous
letter
warning
his
successor
against
thieves
it
was
inexplicable
but
it
was
certain
â€œwhy
should
he
do
itâ€
i
asked
â€œprecisely
what
i
should
wish
to
ask
you
if
he
had
any
such
misgivings
why
could
he
not
come
and
tell
me
directâ€
â€œwill
you
speak
to
him
about
itâ€
â€œthere
again
i
am
in
doubt
he
might
choose
to
deny
that
he
wrote
itâ€
â€œat
any
rateâ€
said
i
â€œthis
warning
is
meant
in
a
friendly
spirit
and
i
should
certainly
act
upon
it
are
the
present
precautions
enough
to
insure
you
against
robberyâ€
â€œi
should
have
thought
so
the
public
are
only
admitted
from
ten
till
five
and
there
is
a
guardian
to
every
two
rooms
he
stands
at
the
door
between
them
and
so
commands
them
bothâ€
â€œbut
at
nightâ€
â€œwhen
the
public
are
gone
we
at
once
put
up
the
great
iron
shutters
which
are
absolutely
burglar-proof
the
watchman
is
a
capable
fellow
he
sits
in
the
lodge
but
he
walks
round
every
three
hours
we
keep
one
electric
light
burning
in
each
room
all
nightâ€
â€œit
is
difficult
to
suggest
anything
moreâ€”short
of
keeping
your
day
watchers
all
nightâ€
â€œwe
could
not
afford
thatâ€
â€œat
least
i
should
communicate
with
the
police
and
have
a
special
constable
put
on
outside
in
belmore
streetâ€
said
i
â€œas
to
the
letter
if
the
writer
wishes
to
be
anonymous
i
think
he
has
a
right
to
remain
so
we
must
trust
to
the
future
to
show
some
reason
for
the
curious
course
which
he
has
adoptedâ€
so
we
dismissed
the
subject
but
all
that
night
after
my
return
to
my
chambers
i
was
puzzling
my
brain
as
to
what
possible
motive
professor
andreas
could
have
for
writing
an
anonymous
warning
letter
to
his
successorâ€”for
that
the
writing
was
his
was
as
certain
to
me
as
if
i
had
seen
him
actually
doing
it
he
foresaw
some
danger
to
the
collection
was
it
because
he
foresaw
it
that
he
abandoned
his
charge
of
it
but
if
so
why
should
he
hesitate
to
warn
mortimer
in
his
own
name
i
puzzled
and
puzzled
until
at
last
i
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep
which
carried
me
beyond
my
usual
hour
of
rising
i
was
aroused
in
a
singular
and
effective
method
for
about
nine
oâ€™clock
my
friend
mortimer
rushed
into
my
room
with
an
expression
of
consternation
upon
his
face
he
was
usually
one
of
the
most
tidy
men
of
my
acquaintance
but
now
his
collar
was
undone
at
one
end
his
tie
was
flying
and
his
hat
at
the
back
of
his
head
i
read
his
whole
story
in
his
frantic
eyes
â€œthe
museum
has
been
robbedâ€
i
cried
springing
up
in
bed
â€œi
fear
so
those
jewels
the
jewels
of
the
urim
and
thummimâ€
he
gasped
for
he
was
out
of
breath
with
running
â€œiâ€™m
going
on
to
the
police-station
come
to
the
museum
as
soon
as
you
can
jackson
good-byeâ€
he
rushed
distractedly
out
of
the
room
and
i
heard
him
clatter
down
the
stairs
i
was
not
long
in
following
his
directions
but
i
found
when
i
arrived
that
he
had
already
returned
with
a
police
inspector
and
another
elderly
gentleman
who
proved
to
be
mr
purvis
one
of
the
partners
of
morson
and
company
the
well-known
diamond
merchants
as
an
expert
in
stones
he
was
always
prepared
to
advise
the
police
they
were
grouped
round
the
case
in
which
the
breastplate
of
the
jewish
priest
had
been
exposed
the
plate
had
been
taken
out
and
laid
upon
the
glass
top
of
the
case
and
the
three
heads
were
bent
over
it
â€œit
is
obvious
that
it
has
been
tampered
withâ€
said
mortimer
â€œit
caught
my
eye
the
moment
that
i
passed
through
the
room
this
morning
i
examined
it
yesterday
evening
so
that
it
is
certain
that
this
has
happened
during
the
nightâ€
it
was
as
he
had
said
obvious
that
some
one
had
been
at
work
upon
it
the
settings
of
the
uppermost
row
of
four
stonesâ€”the
carnelian
peridot
emerald
and
ruby-were
rough
and
jagged
as
if
some
one
had
scraped
all
round
them
the
stones
were
in
their
places
but
the
beautiful
gold-work
which
we
had
admired
only
a
few
days
before
had
been
very
clumsily
pulled
about
â€œit
looks
to
meâ€
said
the
police
inspector
â€œas
if
some
one
had
been
trying
to
take
out
the
stonesâ€
â€œmy
fear
isâ€
said
mortimer
â€œthat
he
not
only
tried
but
succeeded
i
believe
these
four
stones
to
be
skilful
imitations
which
have
been
put
in
the
place
of
the
originalsâ€
the
same
suspicion
had
evidently
been
in
the
mind
of
the
expert
for
he
had
been
carefully
examining
the
four
stones
with
the
aid
of
a
lens
he
now
submitted
them
to
several
tests
and
finally
turned
cheerfully
to
mortimer
â€œi
congratulate
you
sirâ€
said
he
heartily
â€œi
will
pledge
my
reputation
that
all
four
of
these
stones
are
genuine
and
of
a
most
unusual
degree
of
purityâ€
the
colour
began
to
come
back
to
my
poor
friendâ€™s
frightened
face
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
â€œthank
godâ€
he
cried
â€œthen
what
in
the
world
did
the
thief
wantâ€
â€œprobably
he
meant
to
take
the
stones
but
was
interruptedâ€
â€œin
that
case
one
would
expect
him
to
take
them
out
one
at
a
time
but
the
setting
of
each
of
these
has
been
loosened
and
yet
the
stones
are
all
hereâ€
â€œit
is
certainly
most
extraordinaryâ€
said
the
inspector
â€œi
never
remember
a
case
like
it
let
us
see
the
watchmanâ€
the
commissionaire
was
calledâ€”a
soldierly
honest-faced
man
who
seemed
as
concerned
as
ward
mortimer
at
the
incident
â€œno
sir
i
never
heard
a
soundâ€
he
answered
in
reply
to
the
questions
of
the
inspector
â€œi
made
my
rounds
four
times
as
usual
but
i
saw
nothing
suspicious
iâ€™ve
been
in
my
position
ten
years
but
nothing
of
the
kind
has
ever
occurred
beforeâ€
â€œno
thief
could
have
come
through
the
windowsâ€
â€œimpossible
sirâ€
â€œor
passed
you
at
the
doorâ€
â€œno
sir
i
never
left
my
post
except
when
i
walked
my
roundsâ€
â€œwhat
other
openings
are
there
in
the
museumâ€
â€œthere
is
the
door
into
mr
ward
mortimerâ€™s
private
roomsâ€
â€œthat
is
locked
at
nightâ€
my
friend
explained
â€œand
in
order
to
reach
it
any
one
from
the
street
would
have
to
open
the
outside
door
as
wellâ€
â€œyour
servantsâ€
â€œtheir
quarters
are
entirely
separateâ€
â€œwell
wellâ€
said
the
inspector
â€œthis
is
certainly
very
obscure
however
there
has
been
no
harm
done
according
to
mr
purvisâ€
â€œi
will
swear
that
those
stones
are
genuineâ€
â€œso
that
the
case
appears
to
be
merely
one
of
malicious
damage
but
none
the
less
i
should
be
very
glad
to
go
carefully
round
the
premises
and
to
see
if
we
can
find
any
trace
to
show
us
who
your
visitor
may
have
beenâ€
his
investigation
which
lasted
all
the
morning
was
careful
and
intelligent
but
it
led
in
the
end
to
nothing
he
pointed
out
to
us
that
there
were
two
possible
entrances
to
the
museum
which
we
had
not
considered
the
one
was
from
the
cellars
by
a
trap-door
opening
in
the
passage
the
other
through
a
skylight
from
the
lumber-room
overlooking
that
very
chamber
to
which
the
intruder
had
penetrated
as
neither
the
cellar
nor
the
lumber-room
could
be
entered
unless
the
thief
was
already
within
the
locked
doors
the
matter
was
not
of
any
practical
importance
and
the
dust
of
cellar
and
attic
assured
us
that
no
one
had
used
either
one
or
the
other
finally
we
ended
as
we
began
without
the
slightest
clue
as
to
how
why
or
by
whom
the
setting
of
these
four
jewels
had
been
tampered
with
there
remained
one
course
for
mortimer
to
take
and
he
took
it
leaving
the
police
to
continue
their
fruitless
researches
he
asked
me
to
accompany
him
that
afternoon
in
a
visit
to
professor
andreas
he
took
with
him
the
two
letters
and
it
was
his
intention
to
openly
tax
his
predecessor
with
having
written
the
anonymous
warning
and
to
ask
him
to
explain
the
fact
that
he
should
have
anticipated
so
exactly
that
which
had
actually
occurred
the
professor
was
living
in
a
small
villa
in
upper
norwood
but
we
were
informed
by
the
servant
that
he
was
away
from
home
seeing
our
disappointment
she
asked
us
if
we
should
like
to
see
miss
andreas
and
showed
us
into
the
modest
drawing-room
i
have
mentioned
incidentally
that
the
professorâ€™s
daughter
was
a
very
beautiful
girl
she
was
a
blonde
tall
and
graceful
with
a
skin
of
that
delicate
tint
which
the
french
call
â€œmatâ€
the
colour
of
old
ivory
or
of
the
lighter
petals
of
the
sulphur
rose
i
was
shocked
however
as
she
entered
the
room
to
see
how
much
she
had
changed
in
the
last
fortnight
her
young
face
was
haggard
and
her
bright
eyes
heavy
with
trouble
â€œfather
has
gone
to
scotlandâ€
she
said
â€œhe
seems
to
be
tired
and
has
had
a
good
deal
to
worry
him
he
only
left
us
yesterdayâ€
â€œyou
look
a
little
tired
yourself
miss
andreasâ€
said
my
friend
â€œi
have
been
so
anxious
about
fatherâ€
â€œcan
you
give
me
his
scotch
addressâ€
â€œyes
he
is
with
his
brother
the
rev
david
andreas
1
arran
villas
ardrossanâ€
ward
mortimer
made
a
note
of
the
address
and
we
left
without
saying
anything
as
to
the
object
of
our
visit
we
found
ourselves
in
belmore
street
in
the
evening
in
exactly
the
same
position
in
which
we
had
been
in
the
morning
our
only
clue
was
the
professorâ€™s
letter
and
my
friend
had
made
up
his
mind
to
start
for
ardrossan
next
day
and
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
anonymous
letter
when
a
new
development
came
to
alter
our
plans
very
early
on
the
following
morning
i
was
aroused
from
my
sleep
by
a
tap
upon
my
bedroom
door
it
was
a
messenger
with
a
note
from
mortimer
â€œdo
come
roundâ€
it
said
â€œthe
matter
is
becoming
more
and
more
extraordinaryâ€
when
i
obeyed
his
summons
i
found
him
pacing
excitedly
up
and
down
the
central
room
while
the
old
soldier
who
guarded
the
premises
stood
with
military
stiffness
in
a
corner
â€œmy
dear
jacksonâ€
he
cried
â€œi
am
so
delighted
that
you
have
come
for
this
is
a
most
inexplicable
businessâ€
â€œwhat
has
happened
thenâ€
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
case
which
contained
the
breastplate
â€œlook
at
itâ€
said
he
i
did
so
and
could
not
restrain
a
cry
of
surprise
the
setting
of
the
middle
row
of
precious
stones
had
been
profaned
in
the
same
manner
as
the
upper
ones
of
the
twelve
jewels
eight
had
been
now
tampered
with
in
this
singular
fashion
the
setting
of
the
lower
four
was
neat
and
smooth
the
others
jagged
and
irregular
â€œhave
the
stones
been
alteredâ€
i
asked
â€œno
i
am
certain
that
these
upper
four
are
the
same
which
the
expert
pronounced
to
be
genuine
for
i
observed
yesterday
that
little
discoloration
on
the
edge
of
the
emerald
since
they
have
not
extracted
the
upper
stones
there
is
no
reason
to
think
the
lower
have
been
transposed
you
say
that
you
heard
nothing
simpsonâ€
â€œno
sirâ€
the
commissionaire
answered
â€œbut
when
i
made
my
round
after
daylight
i
had
a
special
look
at
these
stones
and
i
saw
at
once
that
some
one
had
been
meddling
with
them
then
i
called
you
sir
and
told
you
i
was
backwards
and
forwards
all
the
night
and
i
never
saw
a
soul
or
heard
a
soundâ€
â€œcome
up
and
have
some
breakfast
with
meâ€
said
mortimer
and
he
took
me
into
his
own
chambersâ€”â€œnow
what
do
you
think
of
this
jacksonâ€
he
asked
â€œit
is
the
most
objectless
futile
idiotic
business
that
ever
i
heard
of
it
can
only
be
the
work
of
a
monomaniacâ€
â€œcan
you
put
forward
any
theoryâ€
a
curious
idea
came
into
my
head
â€œthis
object
is
a
jewish
relic
of
great
antiquity
and
sanctityâ€
said
i
â€œhow
about
the
anti-semitic
movement
could
one
conceive
that
a
fanatic
of
that
way
of
thinking
might
desecrateâ€”â€”â€
â€œno
no
noâ€
cried
mortimer
â€œthat
will
never
do
such
a
man
might
push
his
lunacy
to
the
length
of
destroying
a
jewish
relic
but
why
on
earth
should
he
nibble
round
every
stone
so
carefully
that
he
can
only
do
four
stones
in
a
night
we
must
have
a
better
solution
than
that
and
we
must
find
it
for
ourselves
for
i
do
not
think
that
our
inspector
is
likely
to
help
us
first
of
all
what
do
you
think
of
simpson
the
porterâ€
â€œhave
you
any
reason
to
suspect
himâ€
â€œonly
that
he
is
the
one
person
on
the
premisesâ€
â€œbut
why
should
he
indulge
in
such
wanton
destruction
nothing
has
been
taken
away
he
has
no
motiveâ€
â€œmaniaâ€
â€œno
i
will
swear
to
his
sanityâ€
â€œhave
you
any
other
theoryâ€
â€œwell
yourself
for
example
you
are
not
a
somnambulist
by
any
chanceâ€
â€œnothing
of
the
sort
i
assure
youâ€
â€œthen
i
give
it
upâ€
â€œbut
i
donâ€™tâ€”and
i
have
a
plan
by
which
we
will
make
it
all
clearâ€
â€œto
visit
professor
andreasâ€
â€œno
we
shall
find
our
solution
nearer
than
scotland
i
will
tell
you
what
we
shall
do
you
know
that
skylight
which
overlooks
the
central
hall
we
will
leave
the
electric
lights
in
the
hall
and
we
will
keep
watch
in
the
lumber-room
you
and
i
and
solve
the
mystery
for
ourselves
if
our
mysterious
visitor
is
doing
four
stones
at
a
time
he
has
four
still
to
do
and
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that
he
will
return
to-night
and
complete
the
jobâ€
â€œexcellentâ€
i
cried
â€œwe
will
keep
our
own
secret
and
say
nothing
either
to
the
police
or
to
simpson
will
you
join
meâ€
â€œwith
the
utmost
pleasureâ€
said
i
and
so
it
was
agreed
it
was
ten
oâ€™clock
that
night
when
i
returned
to
the
belmore
street
museum
mortimer
was
as
i
could
see
in
a
state
of
suppressed
nervous
excitement
but
it
was
still
too
early
to
begin
our
vigil
so
we
remained
for
an
hour
or
so
in
his
chambers
discussing
all
the
possibilities
of
the
singular
business
which
we
had
met
to
solve
at
last
the
roaring
stream
of
hansom
cabs
and
the
rush
of
hurrying
feet
became
lower
and
more
intermittent
as
the
pleasure-seekers
passed
on
their
way
to
their
stations
or
their
homes
it
was
nearly
twelve
when
mortimer
led
the
way
to
the
lumber-room
which
overlooked
the
central
hall
of
the
museum
he
had
visited
it
during
the
day
and
had
spread
some
sacking
so
that
we
could
lie
at
our
ease
and
look
straight
down
into
the
museum
the
skylight
was
of
unfrosted
glass
but
was
so
covered
with
dust
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
any
one
looking
up
from
below
to
detect
that
he
was
overlooked
we
cleared
a
small
piece
at
each
corner
which
gave
us
a
complete
view
of
the
room
beneath
us
in
the
cold
white
light
of
the
electric
lamps
everything
stood
out
hard
and
clear
and
i
could
see
the
smallest
detail
of
the
contents
of
the
various
cases
such
a
vigil
is
an
excellent
lesson
since
one
has
no
choice
but
to
look
hard
at
those
objects
which
we
usually
pass
with
such
half-hearted
interest
through
my
little
peep-hole
i
employed
the
hours
in
studying
every
specimen
from
the
huge
mummy-case
which
leaned
against
the
wall
to
those
very
jewels
which
had
brought
us
there
gleaming
and
sparkling
in
their
glass
case
immediately
beneath
us
there
was
much
precious
gold-work
and
many
valuable
stones
scattered
through
the
numerous
cases
but
those
wonderful
twelve
which
made
up
the
urim
and
thummim
glowed
and
burned
with
a
radiance
which
far
eclipsed
the
others
i
studied
in
turn
the
tomb-pictures
of
sicara
the
friezes
from
karnak
the
statues
of
memphis
and
the
inscriptions
of
thebes
but
my
eyes
would
always
come
back
to
that
wonderful
jewish
relic
and
my
mind
to
the
singular
mystery
which
surrounded
it
i
was
lost
in
the
thought
of
it
when
my
companion
suddenly
drew
his
breath
sharply
in
and
seized
my
arm
in
a
convulsive
grip
at
the
same
instant
i
saw
what
it
was
which
had
excited
him
i
have
said
that
against
the
wallâ€”on
the
right-hand
side
of
the
doorway
the
right-hand
side
as
we
looked
at
it
but
the
left
as
one
enteredâ€”there
stood
a
large
mummy-case
to
our
unutterable
amazement
it
was
slowly
opening
gradually
gradually
the
lid
was
swinging
back
and
the
black
slit
which
marked
the
opening
was
becoming
wider
and
wider
so
gently
and
carefully
was
it
done
that
the
movement
was
almost
imperceptible
then
as
we
breathlessly
watched
it
a
white
thin
hand
appeared
at
the
opening
pushing
back
the
painted
lid
then
another
hand
and
finally
a
faceâ€”a
face
which
was
familiar
to
us
both
that
of
professor
andreas
stealthily
he
slunk
out
of
the
mummy-case
like
a
fox
stealing
from
its
burrow
his
head
turning
incessantly
to
left
and
to
right
stepping
then
pausing
then
stepping
again
the
very
image
of
craft
and
of
caution
once
some
sound
in
the
street
struck
him
motionless
and
he
stood
listening
with
his
ear
turned
ready
to
dart
back
to
the
shelter
behind
him
then
he
crept
onwards
again
upon
tiptoe
very
very
softly
and
slowly
until
he
had
reached
the
case
in
the
centre
of
the
room
there
he
took
a
bunch
of
keys
from
his
pocket
unlocked
the
case
took
out
the
jewish
breastplate
and
laying
it
upon
the
glass
in
front
of
him
began
to
work
upon
it
with
some
sort
of
small
glistening
tool
he
was
so
directly
underneath
us
that
his
bent
head
covered
his
work
but
we
could
guess
from
the
movement
of
his
hand
that
he
was
engaged
in
finishing
the
strange
disfigurement
which
he
had
begun
i
could
realize
from
the
heavy
breathing
of
my
companion
and
the
twitchings
of
the
hand
which
still
clutched
my
wrist
the
furious
indignation
which
filled
his
heart
as
he
saw
this
vandalism
in
the
quarter
of
all
others
where
he
could
least
have
expected
it
he
the
very
man
who
a
fortnight
before
had
reverently
bent
over
this
unique
relic
and
who
had
impressed
its
antiquity
and
its
sanctity
upon
us
was
now
engaged
in
this
outrageous
profanation
it
was
impossible
unthinkableâ€”and
yet
there
in
the
white
glare
of
the
electric
light
beneath
us
was
that
dark
figure
with
the
bent
grey
head
and
the
twitching
elbow
what
inhuman
hypocrisy
what
hateful
depth
of
malice
against
his
successor
must
underlie
these
sinister
nocturnal
labours
it
was
painful
to
think
of
and
dreadful
to
watch
even
i
who
had
none
of
the
acute
feelings
of
a
virtuoso
could
not
bear
to
look
on
and
see
this
deliberate
mutilation
of
so
ancient
a
relic
it
was
a
relief
to
me
when
my
companion
tugged
at
my
sleeve
as
a
signal
that
i
was
to
follow
him
as
he
softly
crept
out
of
the
room
it
was
not
until
we
were
within
his
own
quarters
that
he
opened
his
lips
and
then
i
saw
by
his
agitated
face
how
deep
was
his
consternation
â€œthe
abominable
gothâ€
he
cried
â€œcould
you
have
believed
itâ€
â€œit
is
amazingâ€
â€œhe
is
a
villain
or
a
lunaticâ€”one
or
the
other
we
shall
very
soon
see
which
come
with
me
jackson
and
we
shall
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
black
businessâ€
a
door
opened
out
of
the
passage
which
was
the
private
entrance
from
his
rooms
into
the
museum
this
he
opened
softly
with
his
key
having
first
kicked
off
his
shoes
an
example
which
i
followed
we
crept
together
through
room
after
room
until
the
large
hall
lay
before
us
with
that
dark
figure
still
stooping
and
working
at
the
central
case
with
an
advance
as
cautious
as
his
own
we
closed
in
upon
him
but
softly
as
we
went
we
could
not
take
him
entirely
unawares
we
were
still
a
dozen
yards
from
him
when
he
looked
round
with
a
start
and
uttering
a
husky
cry
of
terror
ran
frantically
down
the
museum
â€œsimpson
simpsonâ€
roared
mortimer
and
far
away
down
the
vista
of
electric
lighted
doors
we
saw
the
stiff
figure
of
the
old
soldier
suddenly
appear
professor
andreas
saw
him
also
and
stopped
running
with
a
gesture
of
despair
at
the
same
instant
we
each
laid
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
â€œyes
yes
gentlemenâ€
he
panted
â€œi
will
come
with
you
to
your
room
mr
ward
mortimer
if
you
please
i
feel
that
i
owe
you
an
explanationâ€
my
companionâ€™s
indignation
was
so
great
that
i
could
see
that
he
dared
not
trust
himself
to
reply
we
walked
on
each
side
of
the
old
professor
the
astonished
commissionaire
bringing
up
the
rear
when
we
reached
the
violated
case
mortimer
stopped
and
examined
the
breastplate
already
one
of
the
stones
of
the
lower
row
had
had
its
setting
turned
back
in
the
same
manner
as
the
others
my
friend
held
it
up
and
glanced
furiously
at
his
prisoner
â€œhow
could
youâ€
he
cried
â€œhow
could
youâ€
â€œit
is
horribleâ€”horribleâ€
said
the
professor
â€œi
donâ€™t
wonder
at
your
feelings
take
me
to
your
roomâ€
â€œbut
this
shall
not
be
left
exposedâ€
cried
mortimer
he
picked
the
breastplate
up
and
carried
it
tenderly
in
his
hand
while
i
walked
beside
the
professor
like
a
policeman
with
a
malefactor
we
passed
into
mortimerâ€™s
chambers
leaving
the
amazed
old
soldier
to
understand
matters
as
best
he
could
the
professor
sat
down
in
mortimerâ€™s
arm-chair
and
turned
so
ghastly
a
colour
that
for
the
instant
all
our
resentment
was
changed
to
concern
a
stiff
glass
of
brandy
brought
the
life
back
to
him
once
more
â€œthere
i
am
better
nowâ€
said
he
â€œthese
last
few
days
have
been
too
much
for
me
i
am
convinced
that
i
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
it
is
a
nightmareâ€”a
horrible
nightmareâ€”that
i
should
be
arrested
as
a
burglar
in
what
has
been
for
so
long
my
own
museum
and
yet
i
cannot
blame
you
you
could
not
have
done
otherwise
my
hope
always
was
that
i
should
get
it
all
over
before
i
was
detected
this
would
have
been
my
last
nightâ€™s
workâ€
â€œhow
did
you
get
inâ€
asked
mortimer
â€œby
taking
a
very
great
liberty
with
your
private
door
but
the
object
justified
it
the
object
justified
everything
you
will
not
be
angry
when
you
know
everythingâ€”at
least
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
i
had
a
key
to
your
side
door
and
also
to
the
museum
door
i
did
not
give
them
up
when
i
left
and
so
you
see
it
was
not
difficult
for
me
to
let
myself
into
the
museum
i
used
to
come
in
early
before
the
crowd
had
cleared
from
the
street
then
i
hid
myself
in
the
mummy-case
and
took
refuge
there
whenever
simpson
came
round
i
could
always
hear
him
coming
i
used
to
leave
in
the
same
way
as
i
cameâ€
â€œyou
ran
a
riskâ€
â€œi
had
toâ€
â€œbut
why
what
on
earth
was
your
objectâ€”you
to
do
a
thing
like
thatâ€
mortimer
pointed
reproachfully
at
the
plate
which
lay
before
him
on
the
table
â€œi
could
devise
no
other
means
i
thought
and
thought
but
there
was
no
alternative
except
a
hideous
public
scandal
and
a
private
sorrow
which
would
have
clouded
our
lives
i
acted
for
the
best
incredible
as
it
may
seem
to
you
and
i
only
ask
your
attention
to
enable
me
to
prove
itâ€
â€œi
will
hear
what
you
have
to
say
before
i
take
any
further
stepsâ€
said
mortimer
grimly
â€œi
am
determined
to
hold
back
nothing
and
to
take
you
both
completely
into
my
confidence
i
will
leave
it
to
your
own
generosity
how
far
you
will
use
the
facts
with
which
i
supply
youâ€
â€œwe
have
the
essential
facts
alreadyâ€
â€œand
yet
you
understand
nothing
let
me
go
back
to
what
passed
a
few
weeks
ago
and
i
will
make
it
all
clear
to
you
believe
me
that
what
i
say
is
the
absolute
and
exact
truth
â€œyou
have
met
the
person
who
calls
himself
captain
wilson
i
say
â€˜calls
himselfâ€™
because
i
have
reason
now
to
believe
that
it
is
not
his
correct
name
it
would
take
me
too
long
if
i
were
to
describe
all
the
means
by
which
he
obtained
an
introduction
to
me
and
ingratiated
himself
into
my
friendship
and
the
affection
of
my
daughter
he
brought
letters
from
foreign
colleagues
which
compelled
me
to
show
him
some
attention
and
then
by
his
own
attainments
which
are
considerable
he
succeeded
in
making
himself
a
very
welcome
visitor
at
my
rooms
when
i
learned
that
my
daughterâ€™s
affections
had
been
gained
by
him
i
may
have
thought
it
premature
but
i
certainly
was
not
surprised
for
he
had
a
charm
of
manner
and
of
conversation
which
would
have
made
him
conspicuous
in
any
society
â€œhe
was
much
interested
in
oriental
antiquities
and
his
knowledge
of
the
subject
justified
his
interest
often
when
he
spent
the
evening
with
us
he
would
ask
permission
to
go
down
into
the
museum
and
have
an
opportunity
of
privately
inspecting
the
various
specimens
you
can
imagine
that
i
as
an
enthusiast
was
in
sympathy
with
such
a
request
and
that
i
felt
no
surprise
at
the
constancy
of
his
visits
after
his
actual
engagement
to
elise
there
was
hardly
an
evening
which
he
did
not
pass
with
us
and
an
hour
or
two
were
generally
devoted
to
the
museum
he
had
the
free
run
of
the
place
and
when
i
have
been
away
for
the
evening
i
had
no
objection
to
his
doing
whatever
he
wished
here
this
state
of
things
was
only
terminated
by
the
fact
of
my
resignation
of
my
official
duties
and
my
retirement
to
norwood
where
i
hoped
to
have
the
leisure
to
write
a
considerable
work
which
i
had
planned
â€œit
was
immediately
after
thisâ€”within
a
week
or
soâ€”that
i
first
realized
the
true
nature
and
character
of
the
man
whom
i
had
so
imprudently
introduced
into
my
family
the
discovery
came
to
me
through
letters
from
my
friends
abroad
which
showed
me
that
his
introductions
to
me
had
been
forgeries
aghast
at
the
revelation
i
asked
myself
what
motive
this
man
could
originally
have
had
in
practising
this
elaborate
deception
upon
me
i
was
too
poor
a
man
for
any
fortune-hunter
to
have
marked
me
down
why
then
had
he
come
i
remembered
that
some
of
the
most
precious
gems
in
europe
had
been
under
my
charge
and
i
remembered
also
the
ingenious
excuses
by
which
this
man
had
made
himself
familiar
with
the
cases
in
which
they
were
kept
he
was
a
rascal
who
was
planning
some
gigantic
robbery
how
could
i
without
striking
my
own
daughter
who
was
infatuated
about
him
prevent
him
from
carrying
out
any
plan
which
he
might
have
formed
my
device
was
a
clumsy
one
and
yet
i
could
think
of
nothing
more
effective
if
i
had
written
a
letter
under
my
own
name
you
would
naturally
have
turned
to
me
for
details
which
i
did
not
wish
to
give
i
resorted
to
an
anonymous
letter
begging
you
to
be
upon
your
guard
â€œi
may
tell
you
that
my
change
from
belmore
street
to
norwood
had
not
affected
the
visits
of
this
man
who
had
i
believe
a
real
and
overpowering
affection
for
my
daughter
as
to
her
i
could
not
have
believed
that
any
woman
could
be
so
completely
under
the
influence
of
a
man
as
she
was
his
stronger
nature
seemed
to
entirely
dominate
her
i
had
not
realized
how
far
this
was
the
case
or
the
extent
of
the
confidence
which
existed
between
them
until
that
very
evening
when
his
true
character
for
the
first
time
was
made
clear
to
me
i
had
given
orders
that
when
he
called
he
should
be
shown
into
my
study
instead
of
to
the
drawing-room
there
i
told
him
bluntly
that
i
knew
all
about
him
that
i
had
taken
steps
to
defeat
his
designs
and
that
neither
i
nor
my
daughter
desired
ever
to
see
him
again
i
added
that
i
thanked
god
that
i
had
found
him
out
before
he
had
time
to
harm
those
precious
objects
which
it
had
been
the
work
of
my
lifetime
to
protect
â€œhe
was
certainly
a
man
of
iron
nerve
he
took
my
remarks
without
a
sign
either
of
surprise
or
of
defiance
but
listened
gravely
and
attentively
until
i
had
finished
then
he
walked
across
the
room
without
a
word
and
struck
the
bell
â€œâ€˜ask
miss
andreas
to
be
so
kind
as
to
step
this
wayâ€™
said
he
to
the
servant
â€œmy
daughter
entered
and
the
man
closed
the
door
behind
her
then
he
took
her
hand
in
his
â€œâ€˜eliseâ€™
said
he
â€˜your
father
has
just
discovered
that
i
am
a
villain
he
knows
now
what
you
knew
beforeâ€™
â€œshe
stood
in
silence
listening
â€œâ€˜he
says
that
we
are
to
part
for
everâ€™
said
he
â€œshe
did
not
withdraw
her
hand
â€œâ€˜will
you
be
true
to
me
or
will
you
remove
the
last
good
influence
which
is
ever
likely
to
come
into
my
lifeâ€™
â€œâ€˜johnâ€™
she
cried
passionately
â€˜i
will
never
abandon
you
never
never
not
if
the
whole
world
were
against
youâ€™
â€œin
vain
i
argued
and
pleaded
with
her
it
was
absolutely
useless
her
whole
life
was
bound
up
in
this
man
before
me
my
daughter
gentlemen
is
all
that
i
have
left
to
love
and
it
filled
me
with
agony
when
i
saw
how
powerless
i
was
to
save
her
from
her
ruin
my
helplessness
seemed
to
touch
this
man
who
was
the
cause
of
my
trouble
â€œâ€˜it
may
not
be
as
bad
as
you
think
sirâ€™
said
he
in
his
quiet
inflexible
way
â€˜i
love
elise
with
a
love
which
is
strong
enough
to
rescue
even
one
who
has
such
a
record
as
i
have
it
was
but
yesterday
that
i
promised
her
that
never
again
in
my
whole
life
would
i
do
a
thing
of
which
she
should
be
ashamed
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
it
and
never
yet
did
i
make
up
my
mind
to
a
thing
which
i
did
not
doâ€™
â€œhe
spoke
with
an
air
which
carried
conviction
with
it
as
he
concluded
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
he
drew
out
a
small
cardboard
box
â€œâ€˜i
am
about
to
give
you
a
proof
of
my
determinationâ€™
said
he
â€˜this
elise
shall
be
the
first-fruits
of
your
redeeming
influence
over
me
you
are
right
sir
in
thinking
that
i
had
designs
upon
the
jewels
in
your
possession
such
ventures
have
had
a
charm
for
me
which
depended
as
much
upon
the
risk
run
as
upon
the
value
of
the
prize
those
famous
and
antique
stones
of
the
jewish
priest
were
a
challenge
to
my
daring
and
my
ingenuity
i
determined
to
get
themâ€™
â€œâ€˜i
guessed
as
muchâ€™
â€œâ€˜there
was
only
one
thing
that
you
did
not
guessâ€™
â€œâ€˜and
what
is
thatâ€™
â€œâ€˜that
i
got
them
they
are
in
this
boxâ€™
â€œhe
opened
the
box
and
tilted
out
the
contents
upon
the
corner
of
my
desk
my
hair
rose
and
my
flesh
grew
cold
as
i
looked
there
were
twelve
magnificent
square
stones
engraved
with
mystical
characters
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
they
were
the
jewels
of
the
urim
and
thummim
â€œâ€˜good
godâ€™
i
cried
â€˜how
have
you
escaped
discoveryâ€™
â€œby
the
substitution
of
twelve
others
made
especially
to
my
order
in
which
the
originals
are
so
carefully
imitated
that
i
defy
the
eye
to
detect
the
differenceâ€™
â€œâ€˜then
the
present
stones
are
falseâ€™
i
cried
â€œâ€˜they
have
been
for
some
weeksâ€™
â€œwe
all
stood
in
silence
my
daughter
white
with
emotion
but
still
holding
this
man
by
the
hand
â€œâ€˜you
see
what
i
am
capable
of
eliseâ€™
said
he
â€œâ€˜i
see
that
you
are
capable
of
repentance
and
restitutionâ€™
she
answered
â€œâ€˜yes
thanks
to
your
influence
i
leave
the
stones
in
your
hands
sir
do
what
you
like
about
it
but
remember
that
whatever
you
do
against
me
is
done
against
the
future
husband
of
your
only
daughter
you
will
hear
from
me
soon
again
elise
it
is
the
last
time
that
i
will
ever
cause
pain
to
your
tender
heartâ€™
and
with
these
words
he
left
both
the
room
and
the
house
â€œmy
position
was
a
dreadful
one
here
i
was
with
these
precious
relics
in
my
possession
and
how
could
i
return
them
without
a
scandal
and
an
exposure
i
knew
the
depth
of
my
daughterâ€™s
nature
too
well
to
suppose
that
i
would
ever
be
able
to
detach
her
from
this
man
now
that
she
had
entirely
given
him
her
heart
i
was
not
even
sure
how
far
it
was
right
to
detach
her
if
she
had
such
an
ameliorating
influence
over
him
how
could
i
expose
him
without
injuring
herâ€”and
how
far
was
i
justified
in
exposing
him
when
he
had
voluntarily
put
himself
into
my
power
i
thought
and
thought
until
at
last
i
formed
a
resolution
which
may
seem
to
you
to
be
a
foolish
one
and
yet
if
i
had
to
do
it
again
i
believe
it
would
be
the
best
course
open
to
me
â€œmy
idea
was
to
return
the
stones
without
any
one
being
the
wiser
with
my
keys
i
could
get
into
the
museum
at
any
time
and
i
was
confident
that
i
could
avoid
simpson
whose
hours
and
methods
were
familiar
to
me
i
determined
to
take
no
one
into
my
confidenceâ€”not
even
my
daughterâ€”whom
i
told
that
i
was
about
to
visit
my
brother
in
scotland
i
wanted
a
free
hand
for
a
few
nights
without
inquiry
as
to
my
comings
and
goings
to
this
end
i
took
a
room
in
harding
street
that
very
night
with
an
intimation
that
i
was
a
pressman
and
that
i
should
keep
very
late
hours
â€œthat
night
i
made
my
way
into
the
museum
and
i
replaced
four
of
the
stones
it
was
hard
work
and
took
me
all
night
when
simpson
came
round
i
always
heard
his
footsteps
and
concealed
myself
in
the
mummy-case
i
had
some
knowledge
of
gold-work
but
was
far
less
skilful
than
the
thief
had
been
he
had
replaced
the
setting
so
exactly
that
i
defy
any
one
to
see
the
difference
my
work
was
rude
and
clumsy
however
i
hoped
that
the
plate
might
not
be
carefully
examined
or
the
roughness
of
the
setting
observed
until
my
task
was
done
next
night
i
replaced
four
more
stones
and
to-night
i
should
have
finished
my
task
had
it
not
been
for
the
unfortunate
circumstance
which
has
caused
me
to
reveal
so
much
which
i
should
have
wished
to
keep
concealed
i
appeal
to
you
gentlemen
to
your
sense
of
honour
and
of
compassion
whether
what
i
have
told
you
should
go
any
farther
or
not
my
own
happiness
my
daughterâ€™s
future
the
hopes
of
this
manâ€™s
regeneration
all
depend
upon
your
decisionâ€
â€œwhich
isâ€
said
my
friend
â€œthat
all
is
well
that
ends
well
and
that
the
whole
matter
ends
here
and
at
once
to-morrow
the
loose
settings
shall
be
tightened
by
an
expert
goldsmith
and
so
passes
the
greatest
danger
to
which
since
the
destruction
of
the
temple
the
urim
and
thummim
have
been
exposed
here
is
my
hand
professor
andreas
and
i
can
only
hope
that
under
such
difficult
circumstances
i
should
have
carried
myself
as
unselfishly
and
as
wellâ€
just
one
footnote
to
this
narrative
within
a
month
elise
andreas
was
married
to
a
man
whose
name
had
i
the
indiscretion
to
mention
it
would
appeal
to
my
readers
as
one
who
is
now
widely
and
deservedly
honoured
but
if
the
truth
were
known
that
honour
is
due
not
to
him
but
to
the
gentle
girl
who
plucked
him
back
when
he
had
gone
so
far
down
that
dark
road
along
which
few
return
the
lost
special
the
confession
of
herbert
de
lernac
now
lying
under
sentence
of
death
at
marseilles
has
thrown
a
light
upon
one
of
the
most
inexplicable
crimes
of
the
centuryâ€”an
incident
which
is
i
believe
absolutely
unprecedented
in
the
criminal
annals
of
any
country
although
there
is
a
reluctance
to
discuss
the
matter
in
official
circles
and
little
information
has
been
given
to
the
press
there
are
still
indications
that
the
statement
of
this
arch-criminal
is
corroborated
by
the
facts
and
that
we
have
at
last
found
a
solution
for
a
most
astounding
business
as
the
matter
is
eight
years
old
and
as
its
importance
was
somewhat
obscured
by
a
political
crisis
which
was
engaging
the
public
attention
at
the
time
it
may
be
as
well
to
state
the
facts
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain
them
they
are
collated
from
the
liverpool
papers
of
that
date
from
the
proceedings
at
the
inquest
upon
john
slater
the
engine-driver
and
from
the
records
of
the
london
and
west
coast
railway
company
which
have
been
courteously
put
at
my
disposal
briefly
they
are
as
follows
on
the
3rd
of
june
1890
a
gentleman
who
gave
his
name
as
monsieur
louis
caratal
desired
an
interview
with
mr
james
bland
the
superintendent
of
the
london
and
west
coast
central
station
in
liverpool
he
was
a
small
man
middle-aged
and
dark
with
a
stoop
which
was
so
marked
that
it
suggested
some
deformity
of
the
spine
he
was
accompanied
by
a
friend
a
man
of
imposing
physique
whose
deferential
manner
and
constant
attention
showed
that
his
position
was
one
of
dependence
this
friend
or
companion
whose
name
did
not
transpire
was
certainly
a
foreigner
and
probably
from
his
swarthy
complexion
either
a
spaniard
or
a
south
american
one
peculiarity
was
observed
in
him
he
carried
in
his
left
hand
a
small
black
leather
dispatch-box
and
it
was
noticed
by
a
sharp-eyed
clerk
in
the
central
office
that
this
box
was
fastened
to
his
wrist
by
a
strap
no
importance
was
attached
to
the
fact
at
the
time
but
subsequent
events
endowed
it
with
some
significance
monsieur
caratal
was
shown
up
to
mr
blandâ€™s
office
while
his
companion
remained
outside
monsieur
caratalâ€™s
business
was
quickly
dispatched
he
had
arrived
that
afternoon
from
central
america
affairs
of
the
utmost
importance
demanded
that
he
should
be
in
paris
without
the
loss
of
an
unnecessary
hour
he
had
missed
the
london
express
a
special
must
be
provided
money
was
of
no
importance
time
was
everything
if
the
company
would
speed
him
on
his
way
they
might
make
their
own
terms
mr
bland
struck
the
electric
bell
summoned
mr
potter
hood
the
traffic
manager
and
had
the
matter
arranged
in
five
minutes
the
train
would
start
in
three-quarters
of
an
hour
it
would
take
that
time
to
insure
that
the
line
should
be
clear
the
powerful
engine
called
rochdale
no
247
on
the
companyâ€™s
register
was
attached
to
two
carriages
with
a
guardâ€™s
van
behind
the
first
carriage
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
decreasing
the
inconvenience
arising
from
the
oscillation
the
second
was
divided
as
usual
into
four
compartments
a
first-class
a
first-class
smoking
a
second-class
and
a
second-class
smoking
the
first
compartment
which
was
nearest
to
the
engine
was
the
one
allotted
to
the
travellers
the
other
three
were
empty
the
guard
of
the
special
train
was
james
mcpherson
who
had
been
some
years
in
the
service
of
the
company
the
stoker
william
smith
was
a
new
hand
monsieur
caratal
upon
leaving
the
superintendentâ€™s
office
rejoined
his
companion
and
both
of
them
manifested
extreme
impatience
to
be
off
having
paid
the
money
asked
which
amounted
to
fifty
pounds
five
shillings
at
the
usual
special
rate
of
five
shillings
a
mile
they
demanded
to
be
shown
the
carriage
and
at
once
took
their
seats
in
it
although
they
were
assured
that
the
better
part
of
an
hour
must
elapse
before
the
line
could
be
cleared
in
the
meantime
a
singular
coincidence
had
occurred
in
the
office
which
monsieur
caratal
had
just
quitted
a
request
for
a
special
is
not
a
very
uncommon
circumstance
in
a
rich
commercial
centre
but
that
two
should
be
required
upon
the
same
afternoon
was
most
unusual
it
so
happened
however
that
mr
bland
had
hardly
dismissed
the
first
traveller
before
a
second
entered
with
a
similar
request
this
was
a
mr
horace
moore
a
gentlemanly
man
of
military
appearance
who
alleged
that
the
sudden
serious
illness
of
his
wife
in
london
made
it
absolutely
imperative
that
he
should
not
lose
an
instant
in
starting
upon
the
journey
his
distress
and
anxiety
were
so
evident
that
mr
bland
did
all
that
was
possible
to
meet
his
wishes
a
second
special
was
out
of
the
question
as
the
ordinary
local
service
was
already
somewhat
deranged
by
the
first
there
was
the
alternative
however
that
mr
moore
should
share
the
expense
of
monsieur
caratalâ€™s
train
and
should
travel
in
the
other
empty
first-class
compartment
if
monsieur
caratal
objected
to
having
him
in
the
one
which
he
occupied
it
was
difficult
to
see
any
objection
to
such
an
arrangement
and
yet
monsieur
caratal
upon
the
suggestion
being
made
to
him
by
mr
potter
hood
absolutely
refused
to
consider
it
for
an
instant
the
train
was
his
he
said
and
he
would
insist
upon
the
exclusive
use
of
it
all
argument
failed
to
overcome
his
ungracious
objections
and
finally
the
plan
had
to
be
abandoned
mr
horace
moore
left
the
station
in
great
distress
after
learning
that
his
only
course
was
to
take
the
ordinary
slow
train
which
leaves
liverpool
at
six
oâ€™clock
at
four
thirty-one
exactly
by
the
station
clock
the
special
train
containing
the
crippled
monsieur
caratal
and
his
gigantic
companion
steamed
out
of
the
liverpool
station
the
line
was
at
that
time
clear
and
there
should
have
been
no
stoppage
before
manchester
the
trains
of
the
london
and
west
coast
railway
run
over
the
lines
of
another
company
as
far
as
this
town
which
should
have
been
reached
by
the
special
rather
before
six
oâ€™clock
at
a
quarter
after
six
considerable
surprise
and
some
consternation
were
caused
amongst
the
officials
at
liverpool
by
the
receipt
of
a
telegram
from
manchester
to
say
that
it
had
not
yet
arrived
an
inquiry
directed
to
st
helens
which
is
a
third
of
the
way
between
the
two
cities
elicited
the
following
replyâ€”
â€œto
james
bland
superintendent
central
l

w
c
liverpoolâ€”special
passed
here
at
452
well
up
to
timeâ€”dowser
st
helensâ€
this
telegram
was
received
at
640
at
650
a
second
message
was
received
from
manchesterâ€”
â€œno
sign
of
special
as
advised
by
youâ€
and
then
ten
minutes
later
a
third
more
bewilderingâ€”
â€œpresume
some
mistake
as
to
proposed
running
of
special
local
train
from
st
helens
timed
to
follow
it
has
just
arrived
and
has
seen
nothing
of
it
kindly
wire
advicesâ€”manchesterâ€
the
matter
was
assuming
a
most
amazing
aspect
although
in
some
respects
the
last
telegram
was
a
relief
to
the
authorities
at
liverpool
if
an
accident
had
occurred
to
the
special
it
seemed
hardly
possible
that
the
local
train
could
have
passed
down
the
same
line
without
observing
it
and
yet
what
was
the
alternative
where
could
the
train
be
had
it
possibly
been
side-tracked
for
some
reason
in
order
to
allow
the
slower
train
to
go
past
such
an
explanation
was
possible
if
some
small
repair
had
to
be
effected
a
telegram
was
dispatched
to
each
of
the
stations
between
st
helens
and
manchester
and
the
superintendent
and
traffic
manager
waited
in
the
utmost
suspense
at
the
instrument
for
the
series
of
replies
which
would
enable
them
to
say
for
certain
what
had
become
of
the
missing
train
the
answers
came
back
in
the
order
of
questions
which
was
the
order
of
the
stations
beginning
at
the
st
helens
endâ€”
â€œspecial
passed
here
five
oâ€™clockâ€”collins
greenâ€
â€œspecial
passed
here
six
past
fiveâ€”earlestownâ€
â€œspecial
passed
here
510â€”newtonâ€
â€œspecial
passed
here
520â€”kenyon
junctionâ€
â€œno
special
train
has
passed
hereâ€”barton
mossâ€
the
two
officials
stared
at
each
other
in
amazement
â€œthis
is
unique
in
my
thirty
years
of
experienceâ€
said
mr
bland
â€œabsolutely
unprecedented
and
inexplicable
sir
the
special
has
gone
wrong
between
kenyon
junction
and
barton
mossâ€
â€œand
yet
there
is
no
siding
so
far
as
my
memory
serves
me
between
the
two
stations
the
special
must
have
run
off
the
metalsâ€
â€œbut
how
could
the
four-fifty
parliamentary
pass
over
the
same
line
without
observing
itâ€
â€œthereâ€™s
no
alternative
mr
hood
it
must
be
so
possibly
the
local
train
may
have
observed
something
which
may
throw
some
light
upon
the
matter
we
will
wire
to
manchester
for
more
information
and
to
kenyon
junction
with
instructions
that
the
line
be
examined
instantly
as
far
as
barton
mossâ€
the
answer
from
manchester
came
within
a
few
minutes
â€œno
news
of
missing
special
driver
and
guard
of
slow
train
positive
no
accident
between
kenyon
junction
and
barton
moss
line
quite
clear
and
no
sign
of
anything
unusualâ€”manchesterâ€
â€œthat
driver
and
guard
will
have
to
goâ€
said
mr
bland
grimly
â€œthere
has
been
a
wreck
and
they
have
missed
it
the
special
has
obviously
run
off
the
metals
without
disturbing
the
lineâ€”how
it
could
have
done
so
passes
my
comprehensionâ€”but
so
it
must
be
and
we
shall
have
a
wire
from
kenyon
or
barton
moss
presently
to
say
that
they
have
found
her
at
the
bottom
of
an
embankmentâ€
but
mr
blandâ€™s
prophecy
was
not
destined
to
be
fulfilled
half
an
hour
passed
and
then
there
arrived
the
following
message
from
the
station-master
of
kenyon
junctionâ€”
â€œthere
are
no
traces
of
the
missing
special
it
is
quite
certain
that
she
passed
here
and
that
she
did
not
arrive
at
barton
moss
we
have
detached
engine
from
goods
train
and
i
have
myself
ridden
down
the
line
but
all
is
clear
and
there
is
no
sign
of
any
accidentâ€
mr
bland
tore
his
hair
in
his
perplexity
â€œthis
is
rank
lunacy
hoodâ€
he
cried
â€œdoes
a
train
vanish
into
thin
air
in
england
in
broad
daylight
the
thing
is
preposterous
an
engine
a
tender
two
carriages
a
van
five
human
beingsâ€”and
all
lost
on
a
straight
line
of
railway
unless
we
get
something
positive
within
the
next
hour
iâ€™ll
take
inspector
collins
and
go
down
myselfâ€
and
then
at
last
something
positive
did
occur
it
took
the
shape
of
another
telegram
from
kenyon
junction
â€œregret
to
report
that
the
dead
body
of
john
slater
driver
of
the
special
train
has
just
been
found
among
the
gorse
bushes
at
a
point
two
and
a
quarter
miles
from
the
junction
had
fallen
from
his
engine
pitched
down
the
embankment
and
rolled
among
bushes
injuries
to
his
head
from
the
fall
appear
to
be
cause
of
death
ground
has
now
been
carefully
examined
and
there
is
no
trace
of
the
missing
trainâ€
the
country
was
as
has
already
been
stated
in
the
throes
of
a
political
crisis
and
the
attention
of
the
public
was
further
distracted
by
the
important
and
sensational
developments
in
paris
where
a
huge
scandal
threatened
to
destroy
the
government
and
to
wreck
the
reputations
of
many
of
the
leading
men
in
france
the
papers
were
full
of
these
events
and
the
singular
disappearance
of
the
special
train
attracted
less
attention
than
would
have
been
the
case
in
more
peaceful
times
the
grotesque
nature
of
the
event
helped
to
detract
from
its
importance
for
the
papers
were
disinclined
to
believe
the
facts
as
reported
to
them
more
than
one
of
the
london
journals
treated
the
matter
as
an
ingenious
hoax
until
the
coronerâ€™s
inquest
upon
the
unfortunate
driver
an
inquest
which
elicited
nothing
of
importance
convinced
them
of
the
tragedy
of
the
incident
mr
bland
accompanied
by
inspector
collins
the
senior
detective
officer
in
the
service
of
the
company
went
down
to
kenyon
junction
the
same
evening
and
their
research
lasted
throughout
the
following
day
but
was
attended
with
purely
negative
results
not
only
was
no
trace
found
of
the
missing
train
but
no
conjecture
could
be
put
forward
which
could
possibly
explain
the
facts
at
the
same
time
inspector
collinsâ€™s
official
report
which
lies
before
me
as
i
write
served
to
show
that
the
possibilities
were
more
numerous
than
might
have
been
expected
â€œin
the
stretch
of
railway
between
these
two
pointsâ€
said
he
â€œthe
country
is
dotted
with
ironworks
and
collieries
of
these
some
are
being
worked
and
some
have
been
abandoned
there
are
no
fewer
than
twelve
which
have
small
gauge
lines
which
run
trolly-cars
down
to
the
main
line
these
can
of
course
be
disregarded
besides
these
however
there
are
seven
which
have
or
have
had
proper
lines
running
down
and
connecting
with
points
to
the
main
line
so
as
to
convey
their
produce
from
the
mouth
of
the
mine
to
the
great
centres
of
distribution
in
every
case
these
lines
are
only
a
few
miles
in
length
out
of
the
seven
four
belong
to
collieries
which
are
worked
out
or
at
least
to
shafts
which
are
no
longer
used
these
are
the
redgauntlet
hero
slough
of
despond
and
heartsease
mines
the
latter
having
ten
years
ago
been
one
of
the
principal
mines
in
lancashire
these
four
side
lines
may
be
eliminated
from
our
inquiry
for
to
prevent
possible
accidents
the
rails
nearest
to
the
main
line
have
been
taken
up
and
there
is
no
longer
any
connection
there
remain
three
other
side
lines
leadingâ€”
a
to
the
carnstock
iron
works
b
to
the
big
ben
colliery
c
to
the
perseverance
colliery
â€œof
these
the
big
ben
line
is
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
and
ends
at
a
dead
wall
of
coal
waiting
removal
from
the
mouth
of
the
mine
nothing
had
been
seen
or
heard
there
of
any
special
the
carnstock
iron
works
line
was
blocked
all
day
upon
the
3rd
of
june
by
sixteen
truckloads
of
hematite
it
is
a
single
line
and
nothing
could
have
passed
as
to
the
perseverance
line
it
is
a
large
double
line
which
does
a
considerable
traffic
for
the
output
of
the
mine
is
very
large
on
the
3rd
of
june
this
traffic
proceeded
as
usual
hundreds
of
men
including
a
gang
of
railway
platelayers
were
working
along
the
two
miles
and
a
quarter
which
constitute
the
total
length
of
the
line
and
it
is
inconceivable
that
an
unexpected
train
could
have
come
down
there
without
attracting
universal
attention
it
may
be
remarked
in
conclusion
that
this
branch
line
is
nearer
to
st
helens
than
the
point
at
which
the
engine-driver
was
discovered
so
that
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
train
was
past
that
point
before
misfortune
overtook
her
â€œas
to
john
slater
there
is
no
clue
to
be
gathered
from
his
appearance
or
injuries
we
can
only
say
that
so
far
as
we
can
see
he
met
his
end
by
falling
off
his
engine
though
why
he
fell
or
what
became
of
the
engine
after
his
fall
is
a
question
upon
which
i
do
not
feel
qualified
to
offer
an
opinionâ€
in
conclusion
the
inspector
offered
his
resignation
to
the
board
being
much
nettled
by
an
accusation
of
incompetence
in
the
london
papers
a
month
elapsed
during
which
both
the
police
and
the
company
prosecuted
their
inquiries
without
the
slightest
success
a
reward
was
offered
and
a
pardon
promised
in
case
of
crime
but
they
were
both
unclaimed
every
day
the
public
opened
their
papers
with
the
conviction
that
so
grotesque
a
mystery
would
at
last
be
solved
but
week
after
week
passed
by
and
a
solution
remained
as
far
off
as
ever
in
broad
daylight
upon
a
june
afternoon
in
the
most
thickly
inhabited
portion
of
england
a
train
with
its
occupants
had
disappeared
as
completely
as
if
some
master
of
subtle
chemistry
had
volatilized
it
into
gas
indeed
among
the
various
conjectures
which
were
put
forward
in
the
public
press
there
were
some
which
seriously
asserted
that
supernatural
or
at
least
preternatural
agencies
had
been
at
work
and
that
the
deformed
monsieur
caratal
was
probably
a
person
who
was
better
known
under
a
less
polite
name
others
fixed
upon
his
swarthy
companion
as
being
the
author
of
the
mischief
but
what
it
was
exactly
which
he
had
done
could
never
be
clearly
formulated
in
words
amongst
the
many
suggestions
put
forward
by
various
newspapers
or
private
individuals
there
were
one
or
two
which
were
feasible
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
public
one
which
appeared
in
the
times
over
the
signature
of
an
amateur
reasoner
of
some
celebrity
at
that
date
attempted
to
deal
with
the
matter
in
a
critical
and
semi-scientific
manner
an
extract
must
suffice
although
the
curious
can
see
the
whole
letter
in
the
issue
of
the
3rd
of
july
â€œit
is
one
of
the
elementary
principles
of
practical
reasoningâ€
he
remarked
â€œthat
when
the
impossible
has
been
eliminated
the
residuum
however
improbable
must
contain
the
truth
it
is
certain
that
the
train
left
kenyon
junction
it
is
certain
that
it
did
not
reach
barton
moss
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
unlikely
but
still
possible
that
it
may
have
taken
one
of
the
seven
available
side
lines
it
is
obviously
impossible
for
a
train
to
run
where
there
are
no
rails
and
therefore
we
may
reduce
our
improbables
to
the
three
open
lines
namely
the
carnstock
iron
works
the
big
ben
and
the
perseverance
is
there
a
secret
society
of
colliers
an
english
camorra
which
is
capable
of
destroying
both
train
and
passengers
it
is
improbable
but
it
is
not
impossible
i
confess
that
i
am
unable
to
suggest
any
other
solution
i
should
certainly
advise
the
company
to
direct
all
their
energies
towards
the
observation
of
those
three
lines
and
of
the
workmen
at
the
end
of
them
a
careful
supervision
of
the
pawnbrokersâ€™
shops
of
the
district
might
possibly
bring
some
suggestive
facts
to
lightâ€
the
suggestion
coming
from
a
recognized
authority
upon
such
matters
created
considerable
interest
and
a
fierce
opposition
from
those
who
considered
such
a
statement
to
be
a
preposterous
libel
upon
an
honest
and
deserving
set
of
men
the
only
answer
to
this
criticism
was
a
challenge
to
the
objectors
to
lay
any
more
feasible
explanation
before
the
public
in
reply
to
this
two
others
were
forthcoming
times
july
7th
and
9th
the
first
suggested
that
the
train
might
have
run
off
the
metals
and
be
lying
submerged
in
the
lancashire
and
staffordshire
canal
which
runs
parallel
to
the
railway
for
some
hundreds
of
yards
this
suggestion
was
thrown
out
of
court
by
the
published
depth
of
the
canal
which
was
entirely
insufficient
to
conceal
so
large
an
object
the
second
correspondent
wrote
calling
attention
to
the
bag
which
appeared
to
be
the
sole
luggage
which
the
travellers
had
brought
with
them
and
suggesting
that
some
novel
explosive
of
immense
and
pulverizing
power
might
have
been
concealed
in
it
the
obvious
absurdity
however
of
supposing
that
the
whole
train
might
be
blown
to
dust
while
the
metals
remained
uninjured
reduced
any
such
explanation
to
a
farce
the
investigation
had
drifted
into
this
hopeless
position
when
a
new
and
most
unexpected
incident
occurred
this
was
nothing
less
than
the
receipt
by
mrs
mcpherson
of
a
letter
from
her
husband
james
mcpherson
who
had
been
the
guard
of
the
missing
train
the
letter
which
was
dated
july
5th
1890
was
posted
from
new
york
and
came
to
hand
upon
july
14th
some
doubts
were
expressed
as
to
its
genuine
character
but
mrs
mcpherson
was
positive
as
to
the
writing
and
the
fact
that
it
contained
a
remittance
of
a
hundred
dollars
in
five-dollar
notes
was
enough
in
itself
to
discount
the
idea
of
a
hoax
no
address
was
given
in
the
letter
which
ran
in
this
wayâ€”
â€œmy
dear
wifeâ€”
â€œi
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal
and
i
find
it
very
hard
to
give
you
up
the
same
with
lizzie
i
try
to
fight
against
it
but
it
will
always
come
back
to
me
i
send
you
some
money
which
will
change
into
twenty
english
pounds
this
should
be
enough
to
bring
both
lizzie
and
you
across
the
atlantic
and
you
will
find
the
hamburg
boats
which
stop
at
southampton
very
good
boats
and
cheaper
than
liverpool
if
you
could
come
here
and
stop
at
the
johnston
house
i
would
try
and
send
you
word
how
to
meet
but
things
are
very
difficult
with
me
at
present
and
i
am
not
very
happy
finding
it
hard
to
give
you
both
up
so
no
more
at
present
from
your
loving
husband
â€œjames
mcphersonâ€
for
a
time
it
was
confidently
anticipated
that
this
letter
would
lead
to
the
clearing
up
of
the
whole
matter
the
more
so
as
it
was
ascertained
that
a
passenger
who
bore
a
close
resemblance
to
the
missing
guard
had
travelled
from
southampton
under
the
name
of
summers
in
the
hamburg
and
new
york
liner
vistula
which
started
upon
the
7th
of
june
mrs
mcpherson
and
her
sister
lizzie
dolton
went
across
to
new
york
as
directed
and
stayed
for
three
weeks
at
the
johnston
house
without
hearing
anything
from
the
missing
man
it
is
probable
that
some
injudicious
comments
in
the
press
may
have
warned
him
that
the
police
were
using
them
as
a
bait
however
this
may
be
it
is
certain
that
he
neither
wrote
nor
came
and
the
women
were
eventually
compelled
to
return
to
liverpool
and
so
the
matter
stood
and
has
continued
to
stand
up
to
the
present
year
of
1898
incredible
as
it
may
seem
nothing
has
transpired
during
these
eight
years
which
has
shed
the
least
light
upon
the
extraordinary
disappearance
of
the
special
train
which
contained
monsieur
caratal
and
his
companion
careful
inquiries
into
the
antecedents
of
the
two
travellers
have
only
established
the
fact
that
monsieur
caratal
was
well
known
as
a
financier
and
political
agent
in
central
america
and
that
during
his
voyage
to
europe
he
had
betrayed
extraordinary
anxiety
to
reach
paris
his
companion
whose
name
was
entered
upon
the
passenger
lists
as
eduardo
gomez
was
a
man
whose
record
was
a
violent
one
and
whose
reputation
was
that
of
a
bravo
and
a
bully
there
was
evidence
to
show
however
that
he
was
honestly
devoted
to
the
interests
of
monsieur
caratal
and
that
the
latter
being
a
man
of
puny
physique
employed
the
other
as
a
guard
and
protector
it
may
be
added
that
no
information
came
from
paris
as
to
what
the
objects
of
monsieur
caratalâ€™s
hurried
journey
may
have
been
this
comprises
all
the
facts
of
the
case
up
to
the
publication
in
the
marseilles
papers
of
the
recent
confession
of
herbert
de
lernac
now
under
sentence
of
death
for
the
murder
of
a
merchant
named
bonvalot
this
statement
may
be
literally
translated
as
followsâ€”
â€œit
is
not
out
of
mere
pride
or
boasting
that
i
give
this
information
for
if
that
were
my
object
i
could
tell
a
dozen
actions
of
mine
which
are
quite
as
splendid
but
i
do
it
in
order
that
certain
gentlemen
in
paris
may
understand
that
i
who
am
able
here
to
tell
about
the
fate
of
monsieur
caratal
can
also
tell
in
whose
interest
and
at
whose
request
the
deed
was
done
unless
the
reprieve
which
i
am
awaiting
comes
to
me
very
quickly
take
warning
messieurs
before
it
is
too
late
you
know
herbert
de
lernac
and
you
are
aware
that
his
deeds
are
as
ready
as
his
words
hasten
then
or
you
are
lost
â€œat
present
i
shall
mention
no
namesâ€”if
you
only
heard
the
names
what
would
you
not
thinkâ€”but
i
shall
merely
tell
you
how
cleverly
i
did
it
i
was
true
to
my
employers
then
and
no
doubt
they
will
be
true
to
me
now
i
hope
so
and
until
i
am
convinced
that
they
have
betrayed
me
these
names
which
would
convulse
europe
shall
not
be
divulged
but
on
that
day

well
i
say
no
more
â€œin
a
word
then
there
was
a
famous
trial
in
paris
in
the
year
1890
in
connection
with
a
monstrous
scandal
in
politics
and
finance
how
monstrous
that
scandal
was
can
never
be
known
save
by
such
confidential
agents
as
myself
the
honour
and
careers
of
many
of
the
chief
men
in
france
were
at
stake
you
have
seen
a
group
of
nine-pins
standing
all
so
rigid
and
prim
and
unbending
then
there
comes
the
ball
from
far
away
and
pop
pop
popâ€”there
are
your
nine-pins
on
the
floor
well
imagine
some
of
the
greatest
men
in
france
as
these
nine-pins
and
then
this
monsieur
caratal
was
the
ball
which
could
be
seen
coming
from
far
away
if
he
arrived
then
it
was
pop
pop
pop
for
all
of
them
it
was
determined
that
he
should
not
arrive
â€œi
do
not
accuse
them
all
of
being
conscious
of
what
was
to
happen
there
were
as
i
have
said
great
financial
as
well
as
political
interests
at
stake
and
a
syndicate
was
formed
to
manage
the
business
some
subscribed
to
the
syndicate
who
hardly
understood
what
were
its
objects
but
others
understood
very
well
and
they
can
rely
upon
it
that
i
have
not
forgotten
their
names
they
had
ample
warning
that
monsieur
caratal
was
coming
long
before
he
left
south
america
and
they
knew
that
the
evidence
which
he
held
would
certainly
mean
ruin
to
all
of
them
the
syndicate
had
the
command
of
an
unlimited
amount
of
moneyâ€”absolutely
unlimited
you
understand
they
looked
round
for
an
agent
who
was
capable
of
wielding
this
gigantic
power
the
man
chosen
must
be
inventive
resolute
adaptiveâ€”a
man
in
a
million
they
chose
herbert
de
lernac
and
i
admit
that
they
were
right
â€œmy
duties
were
to
choose
my
subordinates
to
use
freely
the
power
which
money
gives
and
to
make
certain
that
monsieur
caratal
should
never
arrive
in
paris
with
characteristic
energy
i
set
about
my
commission
within
an
hour
of
receiving
my
instructions
and
the
steps
which
i
took
were
the
very
best
for
the
purpose
which
could
possibly
be
devised
â€œa
man
whom
i
could
trust
was
dispatched
instantly
to
south
america
to
travel
home
with
monsieur
caratal
had
he
arrived
in
time
the
ship
would
never
have
reached
liverpool
but
alas
it
had
already
started
before
my
agent
could
reach
it
i
fitted
out
a
small
armed
brig
to
intercept
it
but
again
i
was
unfortunate
like
all
great
organizers
i
was
however
prepared
for
failure
and
had
a
series
of
alternatives
prepared
one
or
the
other
of
which
must
succeed
you
must
not
underrate
the
difficulties
of
my
undertaking
or
imagine
that
a
mere
commonplace
assassination
would
meet
the
case
we
must
destroy
not
only
monsieur
caratal
but
monsieur
caratalâ€™s
documents
and
monsieur
caratalâ€™s
companions
also
if
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
communicated
his
secrets
to
them
and
you
must
remember
that
they
were
on
the
alert
and
keenly
suspicious
of
any
such
attempt
it
was
a
task
which
was
in
every
way
worthy
of
me
for
i
am
always
most
masterful
where
another
would
be
appalled
â€œi
was
all
ready
for
monsieur
caratalâ€™s
reception
in
liverpool
and
i
was
the
more
eager
because
i
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
made
arrangements
by
which
he
would
have
a
considerable
guard
from
the
moment
that
he
arrived
in
london
anything
which
was
to
be
done
must
be
done
between
the
moment
of
his
setting
foot
upon
the
liverpool
quay
and
that
of
his
arrival
at
the
london
and
west
coast
terminus
in
london
we
prepared
six
plans
each
more
elaborate
than
the
last
which
plan
would
be
used
would
depend
upon
his
own
movements
do
what
he
would
we
were
ready
for
him
if
he
had
stayed
in
liverpool
we
were
ready
if
he
took
an
ordinary
train
an
express
or
a
special
all
was
ready
everything
had
been
foreseen
and
provided
for
â€œyou
may
imagine
that
i
could
not
do
all
this
myself
what
could
i
know
of
the
english
railway
lines
but
money
can
procure
willing
agents
all
the
world
over
and
i
soon
had
one
of
the
acutest
brains
in
england
to
assist
me
i
will
mention
no
names
but
it
would
be
unjust
to
claim
all
the
credit
for
myself
my
english
ally
was
worthy
of
such
an
alliance
he
knew
the
london
and
west
coast
line
thoroughly
and
he
had
the
command
of
a
band
of
workers
who
were
trustworthy
and
intelligent
the
idea
was
his
and
my
own
judgment
was
only
required
in
the
details
we
bought
over
several
officials
amongst
whom
the
most
important
was
james
mcpherson
whom
we
had
ascertained
to
be
the
guard
most
likely
to
be
employed
upon
a
special
train
smith
the
stoker
was
also
in
our
employ
john
slater
the
engine-driver
had
been
approached
but
had
been
found
to
be
obstinate
and
dangerous
so
we
desisted
we
had
no
certainty
that
monsieur
caratal
would
take
a
special
but
we
thought
it
very
probable
for
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
to
him
that
he
should
reach
paris
without
delay
it
was
for
this
contingency
therefore
that
we
made
special
preparationsâ€”preparations
which
were
complete
down
to
the
last
detail
long
before
his
steamer
had
sighted
the
shores
of
england
you
will
be
amused
to
learn
that
there
was
one
of
my
agents
in
the
pilot-boat
which
brought
that
steamer
to
its
moorings
â€œthe
moment
that
caratal
arrived
in
liverpool
we
knew
that
he
suspected
danger
and
was
on
his
guard
he
had
brought
with
him
as
an
escort
a
dangerous
fellow
named
gomez
a
man
who
carried
weapons
and
was
prepared
to
use
them
this
fellow
carried
caratalâ€™s
confidential
papers
for
him
and
was
ready
to
protect
either
them
or
his
master
the
probability
was
that
caratal
had
taken
him
into
his
counsels
and
that
to
remove
caratal
without
removing
gomez
would
be
a
mere
waste
of
energy
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
be
involved
in
a
common
fate
and
our
plans
to
that
end
were
much
facilitated
by
their
request
for
a
special
train
on
that
special
train
you
will
understand
that
two
out
of
the
three
servants
of
the
company
were
really
in
our
employ
at
a
price
which
would
make
them
independent
for
a
lifetime
i
do
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
english
are
more
honest
than
any
other
nation
but
i
have
found
them
more
expensive
to
buy
â€œi
have
already
spoken
of
my
english
agentâ€”who
is
a
man
with
a
considerable
future
before
him
unless
some
complaint
of
the
throat
carries
him
off
before
his
time
he
had
charge
of
all
arrangements
at
liverpool
whilst
i
was
stationed
at
the
inn
at
kenyon
where
i
awaited
a
cipher
signal
to
act
when
the
special
was
arranged
for
my
agent
instantly
telegraphed
to
me
and
warned
me
how
soon
i
should
have
everything
ready
he
himself
under
the
name
of
horace
moore
applied
immediately
for
a
special
also
in
the
hope
that
he
would
be
sent
down
with
monsieur
caratal
which
might
under
certain
circumstances
have
been
helpful
to
us
if
for
example
our
great
coup
had
failed
it
would
then
have
become
the
duty
of
my
agent
to
have
shot
them
both
and
destroyed
their
papers
caratal
was
on
his
guard
however
and
refused
to
admit
any
other
traveller
my
agent
then
left
the
station
returned
by
another
entrance
entered
the
guardâ€™s
van
on
the
side
farthest
from
the
platform
and
travelled
down
with
mcpherson
the
guard
â€œin
the
meantime
you
will
be
interested
to
know
what
my
movements
were
everything
had
been
prepared
for
days
before
and
only
the
finishing
touches
were
needed
the
side
line
which
we
had
chosen
had
once
joined
the
main
line
but
it
had
been
disconnected
we
had
only
to
replace
a
few
rails
to
connect
it
once
more
these
rails
had
been
laid
down
as
far
as
could
be
done
without
danger
of
attracting
attention
and
now
it
was
merely
a
case
of
completing
a
juncture
with
the
line
and
arranging
the
points
as
they
had
been
before
the
sleepers
had
never
been
removed
and
the
rails
fish-plates
and
rivets
were
all
ready
for
we
had
taken
them
from
a
siding
on
the
abandoned
portion
of
the
line
with
my
small
but
competent
band
of
workers
we
had
everything
ready
long
before
the
special
arrived
when
it
did
arrive
it
ran
off
upon
the
small
side
line
so
easily
that
the
jolting
of
the
points
appears
to
have
been
entirely
unnoticed
by
the
two
travellers
â€œour
plan
had
been
that
smith
the
stoker
should
chloroform
john
slater
the
driver
so
that
he
should
vanish
with
the
others
in
this
respect
and
in
this
respect
only
our
plans
miscarriedâ€”i
except
the
criminal
folly
of
mcpherson
in
writing
home
to
his
wife
our
stoker
did
his
business
so
clumsily
that
slater
in
his
struggles
fell
off
the
engine
and
though
fortune
was
with
us
so
far
that
he
broke
his
neck
in
the
fall
still
he
remained
as
a
blot
upon
that
which
would
otherwise
have
been
one
of
those
complete
masterpieces
which
are
only
to
be
contemplated
in
silent
admiration
the
criminal
expert
will
find
in
john
slater
the
one
flaw
in
all
our
admirable
combinations
a
man
who
has
had
as
many
triumphs
as
i
can
afford
to
be
frank
and
i
therefore
lay
my
finger
upon
john
slater
and
i
proclaim
him
to
be
a
flaw
â€œbut
now
i
have
got
our
special
train
upon
the
small
line
two
kilomã¨tres
or
rather
more
than
one
mile
in
length
which
leads
or
rather
used
to
lead
to
the
abandoned
heartsease
mine
once
one
of
the
largest
coal
mines
in
england
you
will
ask
how
it
is
that
no
one
saw
the
train
upon
this
unused
line
i
answer
that
along
its
entire
length
it
runs
through
a
deep
cutting
and
that
unless
some
one
had
been
on
the
edge
of
that
cutting
he
could
not
have
seen
it
there
was
some
one
on
the
edge
of
that
cutting
i
was
there
and
now
i
will
tell
you
what
i
saw
â€œmy
assistant
had
remained
at
the
points
in
order
that
he
might
superintend
the
switching
off
of
the
train
he
had
four
armed
men
with
him
so
that
if
the
train
ran
off
the
lineâ€”we
thought
it
probable
because
the
points
were
very
rustyâ€”we
might
still
have
resources
to
fall
back
upon
having
once
seen
it
safely
on
the
side
line
he
handed
over
the
responsibility
to
me
i
was
waiting
at
a
point
which
overlooks
the
mouth
of
the
mine
and
i
was
also
armed
as
were
my
two
companions
come
what
might
you
see
i
was
always
ready
â€œthe
moment
that
the
train
was
fairly
on
the
side
line
smith
the
stoker
slowed-down
the
engine
and
then
having
turned
it
on
to
the
fullest
speed
again
he
and
mcpherson
with
my
english
lieutenant
sprang
off
before
it
was
too
late
it
may
be
that
it
was
this
slowing-down
which
first
attracted
the
attention
of
the
travellers
but
the
train
was
running
at
full
speed
again
before
their
heads
appeared
at
the
open
window
it
makes
me
smile
to
think
how
bewildered
they
must
have
been
picture
to
yourself
your
own
feelings
if
on
looking
out
of
your
luxurious
carriage
you
suddenly
perceived
that
the
lines
upon
which
you
ran
were
rusted
and
corroded
red
and
yellow
with
disuse
and
decay
what
a
catch
must
have
come
in
their
breath
as
in
a
second
it
flashed
upon
them
that
it
was
not
manchester
but
death
which
was
waiting
for
them
at
the
end
of
that
sinister
line
but
the
train
was
running
with
frantic
speed
rolling
and
rocking
over
the
rotten
line
while
the
wheels
made
a
frightful
screaming
sound
upon
the
rusted
surface
i
was
close
to
them
and
could
see
their
faces
caratal
was
praying
i
thinkâ€”there
was
something
like
a
rosary
dangling
out
of
his
hand
the
other
roared
like
a
bull
who
smells
the
blood
of
the
slaughter-house
he
saw
us
standing
on
the
bank
and
he
beckoned
to
us
like
a
madman
then
he
tore
at
his
wrist
and
threw
his
dispatch-box
out
of
the
window
in
our
direction
of
course
his
meaning
was
obvious
here
was
the
evidence
and
they
would
promise
to
be
silent
if
their
lives
were
spared
it
would
have
been
very
agreeable
if
we
could
have
done
so
but
business
is
business
besides
the
train
was
now
as
much
beyond
our
control
as
theirs
â€œhe
ceased
howling
when
the
train
rattled
round
the
curve
and
they
saw
the
black
mouth
of
the
mine
yawning
before
them
we
had
removed
the
boards
which
had
covered
it
and
we
had
cleared
the
square
entrance
the
rails
had
formerly
run
very
close
to
the
shaft
for
the
convenience
of
loading
the
coal
and
we
had
only
to
add
two
or
three
lengths
of
rail
in
order
to
lead
to
the
very
brink
of
the
shaft
in
fact
as
the
lengths
would
not
quite
fit
our
line
projected
about
three
feet
over
the
edge
we
saw
the
two
heads
at
the
window
caratal
below
gomez
above
but
they
had
both
been
struck
silent
by
what
they
saw
and
yet
they
could
not
withdraw
their
heads
the
sight
seemed
to
have
paralyzed
them
â€œi
had
wondered
how
the
train
running
at
a
great
speed
would
take
the
pit
into
which
i
had
guided
it
and
i
was
much
interested
in
watching
it
one
of
my
colleagues
thought
that
it
would
actually
jump
it
and
indeed
it
was
not
very
far
from
doing
so
fortunately
however
it
fell
short
and
the
buffers
of
the
engine
struck
the
other
lip
of
the
shaft
with
a
tremendous
crash
the
funnel
flew
off
into
the
air
the
tender
carriages
and
van
were
all
smashed
up
into
one
jumble
which
with
the
remains
of
the
engine
choked
for
a
minute
or
so
the
mouth
of
the
pit
then
something
gave
way
in
the
middle
and
the
whole
mass
of
green
iron
smoking
coals
brass
fittings
wheels
woodwork
and
cushions
all
crumbled
together
and
crashed
down
into
the
mine
we
heard
the
rattle
rattle
rattle
as
the
dã©bris
struck
against
the
walls
and
then
quite
a
long
time
afterwards
there
came
a
deep
roar
as
the
remains
of
the
train
struck
the
bottom
the
boiler
may
have
burst
for
a
sharp
crash
came
after
the
roar
and
then
a
dense
cloud
of
steam
and
smoke
swirled
up
out
of
the
black
depths
falling
in
a
spray
as
thick
as
rain
all
round
us
then
the
vapour
shredded
off
into
thin
wisps
which
floated
away
in
the
summer
sunshine
and
all
was
quiet
again
in
the
heartsease
mine
â€œand
now
having
carried
out
our
plans
so
successfully
it
only
remained
to
leave
no
trace
behind
us
our
little
band
of
workers
at
the
other
end
had
already
ripped
up
the
rails
and
disconnected
the
side
line
replacing
everything
as
it
had
been
before
we
were
equally
busy
at
the
mine
the
funnel
and
other
fragments
were
thrown
in
the
shaft
was
planked
over
as
it
used
to
be
and
the
lines
which
led
to
it
were
torn
up
and
taken
away
then
without
flurry
but
without
delay
we
all
made
our
way
out
of
the
country
most
of
us
to
paris
my
english
colleague
to
manchester
and
mcpherson
to
southampton
whence
he
emigrated
to
america
let
the
english
papers
of
that
date
tell
how
thoroughly
we
had
done
our
work
and
how
completely
we
had
thrown
the
cleverest
of
their
detectives
off
our
track
â€œyou
will
remember
that
gomez
threw
his
bag
of
papers
out
of
the
window
and
i
need
not
say
that
i
secured
that
bag
and
brought
them
to
my
employers
it
may
interest
my
employers
now
however
to
learn
that
out
of
that
bag
i
took
one
or
two
little
papers
as
a
souvenir
of
the
occasion
i
have
no
wish
to
publish
these
papers
but
still
it
is
every
man
for
himself
in
this
world
and
what
else
can
i
do
if
my
friends
will
not
come
to
my
aid
when
i
want
them
messieurs
you
may
believe
that
herbert
de
lernac
is
quite
as
formidable
when
he
is
against
you
as
when
he
is
with
you
and
that
he
is
not

go

you
can
fill
up

you
read

promise
you
that
in
the
next
edition
there
will
be
no
blanks
to
fill
â€œpsâ€”as
i
look
over
my
statement
there
is
only
one
omission
which
i
can
see
it
concerns
the
unfortunate
man
mcpherson
who
was
foolish
enough
to
write
to
his
wife
and
to
make
an
appointment
with
her
in
new
york
it
can
be
imagined
that
when
interests
like
ours
were
at
stake
we
could
not
leave
them
to
the
chance
of
whether
a
man
in
that
class
of
life
would
or
would
not
give
away
his
secrets
to
a
woman
having
once
broken
his
oath
by
writing
to
his
wife
we
could
not
trust
him
any
more
we
took
steps
therefore
to
insure
that
he
should
not
see
his
wife
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
write
to
her
and
to
assure
her
that
there
is
no
impediment
to
her
marrying
againâ€
the
club-footed
grocer
my
uncle
mr
stephen
maple
had
been
at
the
same
time
the
most
successful
and
the
least
respectable
of
our
family
so
that
we
hardly
knew
whether
to
take
credit
for
his
wealth
or
to
feel
ashamed
of
his
position
he
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
established
a
large
grocery
in
stepney
which
did
a
curious
mixed
business
not
always
as
we
had
heard
of
a
very
savoury
character
with
the
riverside
and
seafaring
people
he
was
shipâ€™s
chandler
provision
merchant
and
if
rumour
spoke
truly
some
other
things
as
well
such
a
trade
however
lucrative
had
its
drawbacks
as
was
evident
when
after
twenty
years
of
prosperity
he
was
savagely
assaulted
by
one
of
his
customers
and
left
for
dead
with
three
smashed
ribs
and
a
broken
leg
which
mended
so
badly
that
it
remained
for
ever
three
inches
shorter
than
the
other
this
incident
seemed
not
unnaturally
to
disgust
him
with
his
surroundings
for
after
the
trial
in
which
his
assailant
was
condemned
to
fifteen
yearsâ€™
penal
servitude
he
retired
from
his
business
and
settled
in
a
lonely
part
of
the
north
of
england
whence
until
that
morning
we
had
never
once
heard
of
himâ€”not
even
at
the
death
of
my
father
who
was
his
only
brother
my
mother
read
his
letter
aloud
to
me
â€œif
your
son
is
with
you
ellen
and
if
he
is
as
stout
a
lad
as
he
promised
for
when
last
i
heard
from
you
then
send
him
up
to
me
by
the
first
train
after
this
comes
to
hand
he
will
find
that
to
serve
me
will
pay
him
better
than
the
engineering
and
if
i
pass
away
though
thank
god
there
is
no
reason
to
complain
as
to
my
health
you
will
see
that
i
have
not
forgotten
my
brotherâ€™s
son
congleton
is
the
station
and
then
a
drive
of
four
miles
to
greta
house
where
i
am
now
living
i
will
send
a
trap
to
meet
the
seven
oâ€™clock
train
for
it
is
the
only
one
which
stops
here
mind
that
you
send
him
ellen
for
i
have
very
strong
reasons
for
wishing
him
to
be
with
me
let
bygones
be
bygones
if
there
has
been
anything
between
us
in
the
past
if
you
should
fail
me
now
you
will
live
to
regret
itâ€
we
were
seated
at
either
side
of
the
breakfast
table
looking
blankly
at
each
other
and
wondering
what
this
might
mean
when
there
came
a
ring
at
the
bell
and
the
maid
walked
in
with
a
telegram
it
was
from
uncle
stephen
â€œon
no
account
let
john
get
out
at
congletonâ€
said
the
message
â€œhe
will
find
trap
waiting
seven
oâ€™clock
evening
train
stedding
bridge
one
station
further
down
line
let
him
drive
not
me
but
garth
farm
houseâ€”six
miles
there
will
receive
instructions
do
not
fail
only
you
to
look
toâ€
â€œthat
is
true
enoughâ€
said
my
mother
â€œas
far
as
i
know
your
uncle
has
not
a
friend
in
the
world
nor
has
he
ever
deserved
one
he
has
always
been
a
hard
man
in
his
dealings
and
he
held
back
his
money
from
your
father
at
a
time
when
a
few
pounds
would
have
saved
him
from
ruin
why
should
i
send
my
only
son
to
serve
him
nowâ€
but
my
own
inclinations
were
all
for
the
adventure
â€œif
i
have
him
for
a
friend
he
can
help
me
in
my
professionâ€
i
argued
taking
my
mother
upon
her
weakest
side
â€œi
have
never
known
him
to
help
any
one
yetâ€
said
she
bitterly
â€œand
why
all
this
mystery
about
getting
out
at
a
distant
station
and
driving
to
the
wrong
address
he
has
got
himself
into
some
trouble
and
he
wishes
us
to
get
him
out
of
it
when
he
has
used
us
he
will
throw
us
aside
as
he
has
done
before
your
father
might
have
been
living
now
if
he
had
only
helped
himâ€
but
at
last
my
arguments
prevailed
for
as
i
pointed
out
we
had
much
to
gain
and
little
to
lose
and
why
should
we
the
poorest
members
of
a
family
go
out
of
our
way
to
offend
the
rich
one
my
bag
was
packed
and
my
cab
at
the
door
when
there
came
a
second
telegram
â€œgood
shooting
let
john
bring
gun
remember
stedding
bridge
not
congletonâ€
and
so
with
a
gun-case
added
to
my
luggage
and
some
surprise
at
my
uncleâ€™s
insistence
i
started
off
upon
my
adventure
the
journey
lies
over
the
main
northern
railway
as
far
as
the
station
of
carnfield
where
one
changes
for
the
little
branch
line
which
winds
over
the
fells
in
all
england
there
is
no
harsher
or
more
impressive
scenery
for
two
hours
i
passed
through
desolate
rolling
plains
rising
at
places
into
low
stone-littered
hills
with
long
straight
outcrops
of
jagged
rock
showing
upon
their
surface
here
and
there
little
grey-roofed
grey-walled
cottages
huddled
into
villages
but
for
many
miles
at
a
time
no
house
was
visible
nor
any
sign
of
life
save
the
scattered
sheep
which
wandered
over
the
mountain
sides
it
was
a
depressing
country
and
my
heart
grew
heavier
and
heavier
as
i
neared
my
journeyâ€™s
end
until
at
last
the
train
pulled
up
at
the
little
village
of
stedding
bridge
where
my
uncle
had
told
me
to
alight
a
single
ramshackle
trap
with
a
country
lout
to
drive
it
was
waiting
at
the
station
â€œis
this
mr
stephen
mapleâ€™sâ€
i
asked
the
fellow
looked
at
me
with
eyes
which
were
full
of
suspicion
â€œwhat
is
your
nameâ€
he
asked
speaking
a
dialect
which
i
will
not
attempt
to
reproduce
â€œjohn
mapleâ€
â€œanything
to
prove
itâ€
i
half
raised
my
hand
for
my
temper
is
none
of
the
best
and
then
i
reflected
that
the
fellow
was
probably
only
carrying
out
the
directions
of
my
uncle
for
answer
i
pointed
to
my
name
printed
upon
my
gun-case
â€œyes
yes
that
is
right
itâ€™s
john
maple
sure
enoughâ€
said
he
slowly
spelling
it
out
â€œget
in
maister
for
we
have
a
bit
of
a
drive
before
usâ€
the
road
white
and
shining
like
all
the
roads
in
that
limestone
country
ran
in
long
sweeps
over
the
fells
with
low
walls
of
loose
stone
upon
either
side
of
it
the
huge
moors
mottled
with
sheep
and
with
boulders
rolled
away
in
gradually
ascending
curves
to
the
misty
sky-line
in
one
place
a
fall
of
the
land
gave
a
glimpse
of
a
grey
angle
of
distant
sea
bleak
and
sad
and
stern
were
all
my
surroundings
and
i
felt
under
their
influence
that
this
curious
mission
of
mine
was
a
more
serious
thing
than
it
had
appeared
when
viewed
from
london
this
sudden
call
for
help
from
an
uncle
whom
i
had
never
seen
and
of
whom
i
had
heard
little
that
was
good
the
urgency
of
it
his
reference
to
my
physical
powers
the
excuse
by
which
he
had
ensured
that
i
should
bring
a
weapon
all
hung
together
and
pointed
to
some
vague
but
sinister
meaning
things
which
appeared
to
be
impossible
in
kensington
became
very
probable
upon
these
wild
and
isolated
hillsides
at
last
oppressed
with
my
own
dark
thoughts
i
turned
to
my
companion
with
the
intention
of
asking
some
questions
about
my
uncle
but
the
expression
upon
his
face
drove
the
idea
from
my
head
he
was
not
looking
at
his
old
unclipped
chestnut
horse
nor
at
the
road
along
which
he
was
driving
but
his
face
was
turned
in
my
direction
and
he
was
staring
past
me
with
an
expression
of
curiosity
and
as
i
thought
of
apprehension
he
raised
the
whip
to
lash
the
horse
and
then
dropped
it
again
as
if
convinced
that
it
was
useless
at
the
same
time
following
the
direction
of
his
gaze
i
saw
what
it
was
which
had
excited
him
a
man
was
running
across
the
moor
he
ran
clumsily
stumbling
and
slipping
among
the
stones
but
the
road
curved
and
it
was
easy
for
him
to
cut
us
off
as
we
came
up
to
the
spot
for
which
he
had
been
making
he
scrambled
over
the
stone
wall
and
stood
waiting
with
the
evening
sun
shining
on
his
brown
clean-shaven
face
he
was
a
burly
fellow
and
in
bad
condition
for
he
stood
with
his
hand
on
his
ribs
panting
and
blowing
after
his
short
run
as
we
drove
up
i
saw
the
glint
of
earrings
in
his
ears
â€œsay
mate
where
are
you
bound
forâ€
he
asked
in
a
rough
but
good-humoured
fashion
â€œfarmer
purcellâ€™s
at
the
garth
farmâ€
said
the
driver
â€œsorry
to
stop
youâ€
cried
the
other
standing
aside
â€œi
thought
as
i
would
hail
you
as
you
passed
for
if
so
be
as
you
had
been
going
my
way
i
should
have
made
bold
to
ask
you
for
a
passageâ€
his
excuse
was
an
absurd
one
since
it
was
evident
that
our
little
trap
was
as
full
as
it
could
be
but
my
driver
did
not
seem
disposed
to
argue
he
drove
on
without
a
word
and
looking
back
i
could
see
the
stranger
sitting
by
the
roadside
and
cramming
tobacco
into
his
pipe
â€œa
sailorâ€
said
i
â€œyes
maister
weâ€™re
not
more
than
a
few
miles
from
morecambe
bayâ€
the
driver
remarked
â€œyou
seemed
frightened
of
himâ€
i
observed
â€œdid
iâ€
said
he
drily
and
then
after
a
long
pause
â€œmaybe
i
wasâ€
as
to
his
reasons
for
fear
i
could
get
nothing
from
him
and
though
i
asked
him
many
questions
he
was
so
stupid
or
else
so
clever
that
i
could
learn
nothing
from
his
replies
i
observed
however
that
from
time
to
time
he
swept
the
moors
with
a
troubled
eye
but
their
huge
brown
expanse
was
unbroken
by
any
moving
figure
at
last
in
a
sort
of
cleft
in
the
hills
in
front
of
us
i
saw
a
long
low-lying
farm
building
the
centre
of
all
those
scattered
flocks
â€œgarth
farmâ€
said
my
driver
â€œthere
is
farmer
purcell
himselfâ€
he
added
as
a
man
strolled
out
of
the
porch
and
stood
waiting
for
our
arrival
he
advanced
as
i
descended
from
the
trap
a
hard
weather-worn
fellow
with
light
blue
eyes
and
hair
and
beard
like
sun-bleached
grass
in
his
expression
i
read
the
same
surly
ill-will
which
i
had
already
observed
in
my
driver
their
malevolence
could
not
be
directed
towards
a
complete
stranger
like
myself
and
so
i
began
to
suspect
that
my
uncle
was
no
more
popular
on
the
north-country
fells
than
he
had
been
in
stepney
highway
â€œyouâ€™re
to
stay
here
until
nightfall
thatâ€™s
mr
stephen
mapleâ€™s
wishâ€
said
he
curtly
â€œyou
can
have
some
tea
and
bacon
if
you
like
itâ€™s
the
best
we
can
give
youâ€
i
was
very
hungry
and
accepted
the
hospitality
in
spite
of
the
churlish
tone
in
which
it
was
offered
the
farmerâ€™s
wife
and
his
two
daughters
came
into
the
sitting-room
during
the
meal
and
i
was
aware
of
a
certain
curiosity
with
which
they
regarded
me
it
may
have
been
that
a
young
man
was
a
rarity
in
this
wilderness
or
it
may
be
that
my
attempts
at
conversation
won
their
goodwill
but
they
all
three
showed
a
kindliness
in
their
manner
it
was
getting
dark
so
i
remarked
that
it
was
time
for
me
to
be
pushing
on
to
greta
house
â€œyouâ€™ve
made
up
your
mind
to
go
thenâ€
said
the
older
woman
â€œcertainly
i
have
come
all
the
way
from
londonâ€
â€œthereâ€™s
no
one
hindering
you
from
going
back
thereâ€
â€œbut
i
have
come
to
see
mr
maple
my
uncleâ€
â€œoh
well
no
one
can
stop
you
if
you
want
to
go
onâ€
said
the
woman
and
became
silent
as
her
husband
entered
the
room
with
every
fresh
incident
i
felt
that
i
was
moving
in
an
atmosphere
of
mystery
and
peril
and
yet
it
was
all
so
intangible
and
so
vague
that
i
could
not
guess
where
my
danger
lay
i
should
have
asked
the
farmerâ€™s
wife
point-blank
but
her
surly
husband
seemed
to
divine
the
sympathy
which
she
felt
for
me
and
never
again
left
us
together
â€œitâ€™s
time
you
were
going
misterâ€
said
he
at
last
as
his
wife
lit
the
lamp
upon
the
table
â€œis
the
trap
readyâ€
â€œyouâ€™ll
need
no
trap
youâ€™ll
walkâ€
said
he
â€œhow
shall
i
know
the
wayâ€
â€œwilliam
will
go
with
youâ€
william
was
the
youth
who
had
driven
me
up
from
the
station
he
was
waiting
at
the
door
and
he
shouldered
my
gun-case
and
bag
i
stayed
behind
to
thank
the
farmer
for
his
hospitality
but
he
would
have
none
of
it
â€œi
ask
no
thanks
from
mr
stephen
maple
nor
any
friend
of
hisâ€
said
he
bluntly
â€œi
am
paid
for
what
i
do
if
i
was
not
paid
i
would
not
do
it
go
your
way
young
man
and
say
no
moreâ€
he
turned
rudely
on
his
heel
and
re-entered
his
house
slamming
the
door
behind
him
it
was
quite
dark
outside
with
heavy
black
clouds
drifting
slowly
across
the
sky
once
clear
of
the
farm
inclosure
and
out
on
the
moor
i
should
have
been
hopelessly
lost
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
guide
who
walked
in
front
of
me
along
narrow
sheep-tracks
which
were
quite
invisible
to
me
every
now
and
then
without
seeing
anything
we
heard
the
clumsy
scuffling
of
the
creatures
in
the
darkness
at
first
my
guide
walked
swiftly
and
carelessly
but
gradually
his
pace
slowed
down
until
at
last
he
was
going
very
slowly
and
stealthily
like
one
who
walks
light-footed
amid
imminent
menace
this
vague
inexplicable
sense
of
danger
in
the
midst
of
the
loneliness
of
that
vast
moor
was
more
daunting
than
any
evident
peril
could
be
and
i
had
begun
to
press
him
as
to
what
it
was
that
he
feared
when
suddenly
he
stopped
and
dragged
me
down
among
some
gorse
bushes
which
lined
the
path
his
tug
at
my
coat
was
so
strenuous
and
imperative
that
i
realized
that
the
danger
was
a
pressing
one
and
in
an
instant
i
was
squatting
down
beside
him
as
still
as
the
bushes
which
shadowed
us
it
was
so
dark
there
that
i
could
not
even
see
the
lad
beside
me
it
was
a
warm
night
and
a
hot
wind
puffed
in
our
faces
suddenly
in
this
wind
there
came
something
homely
and
familiarâ€”the
smell
of
burning
tobacco
and
then
a
face
illuminated
by
the
glowing
bowl
of
a
pipe
came
floating
towards
us
the
man
was
all
in
shadow
but
just
that
one
dim
halo
of
light
with
the
face
which
filled
it
brighter
below
and
shading
away
into
darkness
above
stood
out
against
the
universal
blackness
a
thin
hungry
face
thickly
freckled
with
yellow
over
the
cheek
bones
blue
watery
eyes
an
ill-nourished
light-coloured
moustache
a
peaked
yachting
capâ€”that
was
all
that
i
saw
he
passed
us
looking
vacantly
in
front
of
him
and
we
heard
the
steps
dying
away
along
the
path
â€œwho
was
itâ€
i
asked
as
we
rose
to
our
feet
â€œi
donâ€™t
knowâ€
the
fellowâ€™s
continual
profession
of
ignorance
made
me
angry
â€œwhy
should
you
hide
yourself
thenâ€
i
asked
sharply
â€œbecause
maister
maple
told
me
he
said
that
i
were
to
meet
no
one
if
i
met
any
one
i
should
get
no
payâ€
â€œyou
met
that
sailor
on
the
roadâ€
â€œyes
and
i
think
he
was
one
of
themâ€
â€œone
of
whomâ€
â€œone
of
the
folk
that
have
come
on
the
fells
they
are
watchinâ€™
greta
house
and
maister
maple
is
afeard
of
them
thatâ€™s
why
he
wanted
us
to
keep
clear
of
them
and
thatâ€™s
why
iâ€™ve
been
a-trying
to
dodge
â€˜emâ€
here
was
something
definite
at
last
some
body
of
men
were
threatening
my
uncle
the
sailor
was
one
of
them
the
man
with
the
peaked
capâ€”probably
a
sailor
alsoâ€”was
another
i
bethought
me
of
stepney
highway
and
of
the
murderous
assault
made
upon
my
uncle
there
things
were
fitting
themselves
into
a
connected
shape
in
my
mind
when
a
light
twinkled
over
the
fell
and
my
guide
informed
me
that
it
was
greta
the
place
lay
in
a
dip
among
the
moors
so
that
one
was
very
near
it
before
one
saw
it
a
short
walk
brought
us
up
to
the
door
i
could
see
little
of
the
building
save
that
the
lamp
which
shone
through
a
small
latticed
window
showed
me
dimly
that
it
was
both
long
and
lofty
the
low
door
under
an
overhanging
lintel
was
loosely
fitted
and
light
was
bursting
out
on
each
side
of
it
the
inmates
of
this
lonely
house
appeared
to
be
keenly
on
their
guard
for
they
had
heard
our
footsteps
and
we
were
challenged
before
we
reached
the
door
â€œwho
is
thereâ€
cried
a
deep-booming
voice
and
urgently
â€œwho
is
it
i
sayâ€
â€œitâ€™s
me
maister
maple
i
have
brought
the
gentlemanâ€
there
was
a
sharp
click
and
a
small
wooden
shutter
flew
open
in
the
door
the
gleam
of
a
lantern
shone
upon
us
for
a
few
seconds
then
the
shutter
closed
again
with
a
great
rasping
of
locks
and
clattering
of
bars
the
door
was
opened
and
i
saw
my
uncle
standing
framed
in
that
vivid
yellow
square
cut
out
of
the
darkness
he
was
a
small
thick
man
with
a
great
rounded
bald
head
and
one
thin
border
of
gingery
curls
it
was
a
fine
head
the
head
of
a
thinker
but
his
large
white
face
was
heavy
and
commonplace
with
a
broad
loose-lipped
mouth
and
two
hanging
dewlaps
on
either
side
of
it
his
eyes
were
small
and
restless
and
his
light-coloured
lashes
were
continually
moving
my
mother
had
said
once
that
they
reminded
her
of
the
legs
of
a
woodlouse
and
i
saw
at
the
first
glance
what
she
meant
i
heard
also
that
in
stepney
he
had
learned
the
language
of
his
customers
and
i
blushed
for
our
kinship
as
i
listened
to
his
villainous
accent
â€œso
nephewâ€
said
he
holding
out
his
hand
â€œcome
in
come
in
man
quick
and
donâ€™t
leave
the
door
open
your
mother
said
you
were
grown
a
big
lad
and
my
word
she
â€˜as
a
right
to
say
so
â€˜ereâ€™s
a
â€˜alf-crown
for
you
william
and
you
can
go
back
again
put
the
things
down
â€˜ere
enoch
take
mr
johnâ€™s
things
and
see
that
â€˜is
supper
is
on
the
tableâ€
as
my
uncle
after
fastening
the
door
turned
to
show
me
into
the
sitting-room
i
became
aware
of
his
most
striking
peculiarity
the
injuries
which
he
had
received
some
years
ago
had
as
i
have
already
remarked
left
one
leg
several
inches
shorter
than
the
other
to
atone
for
this
he
wore
one
of
those
enormous
wooden
soles
to
his
boots
which
are
prescribed
by
surgeons
in
such
cases
he
walked
without
a
limp
but
his
tread
on
the
stone
flooring
made
a
curious
clack-click
clack-click
as
the
wood
and
the
leather
alternated
whenever
he
moved
it
was
to
the
rhythm
of
this
singular
castanet
the
great
kitchen
with
its
huge
fireplace
and
carved
settle
corners
showed
that
this
dwelling
was
an
old-time
farmhouse
on
one
side
of
the
room
a
line
of
boxes
stood
all
corded
and
packed
the
furniture
was
scant
and
plain
but
on
a
trestle-table
in
the
centre
some
supper
cold
meat
bread
and
a
jug
of
beer
was
laid
for
me
an
elderly
manservant
as
manifest
a
cockney
as
his
master
waited
upon
me
while
my
uncle
sitting
in
a
comer
asked
me
many
questions
as
to
my
mother
and
myself
when
my
meal
was
finished
he
ordered
his
man
enoch
to
unpack
my
gun
i
observed
that
two
other
guns
old
rusted
weapons
were
leaning
against
the
wall
beside
the
window
â€œitâ€™s
the
window
iâ€™m
afraid
ofâ€
said
my
uncle
in
the
deep
reverberant
voice
which
contrasted
oddly
with
his
plump
little
figure
â€œthe
doorâ€™s
safe
against
anything
short
of
dynamite
but
the
windowâ€™s
a
terror
hi
hiâ€
he
yelled
â€œdonâ€™t
walk
across
the
light
you
can
duck
when
you
pass
the
latticeâ€
â€œfor
fear
of
being
seenâ€
i
asked
â€œfor
fear
of
beinâ€™
shot
my
lad
thatâ€™s
the
trouble
now
come
anâ€™
sit
beside
me
on
the
trestle
â€˜ere
and
iâ€™ll
tell
you
all
about
it
for
i
can
see
that
you
are
the
right
sort
and
can
be
trustedâ€
his
flattery
was
clumsy
and
halting
and
it
was
evident
that
he
was
very
eager
to
conciliate
me
i
sat
down
beside
him
and
he
drew
a
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
it
was
a
western
morning
news
and
the
date
was
ten
days
before
the
passage
over
which
he
pressed
a
long
black
nail
was
concerned
with
the
release
from
dartmoor
of
a
convict
named
elias
whose
term
of
sentence
had
been
remitted
on
account
of
his
defence
of
a
warder
who
had
been
attacked
in
the
quarries
the
whole
account
was
only
a
few
lines
long
â€œwho
is
he
thenâ€
i
asked
my
uncle
cocked
his
distorted
foot
into
the
air
â€œthatâ€™s
â€˜is
markâ€
said
he
â€œâ€˜e
was
doinâ€™
time
for
that
how
â€˜eâ€™s
out
anâ€™
after
me
againâ€
â€œbut
why
should
he
be
after
youâ€
â€œbecause
â€˜e
wants
to
kill
me
because
â€˜eâ€™ll
never
rest
the
worrying
devil
until
â€˜e
â€˜as
â€˜ad
â€˜is
revenge
on
me
itâ€™s
this
way
nephew
iâ€™ve
no
secrets
from
you
â€˜e
thinks
iâ€™ve
wronged
â€˜im
for
argumentâ€™s
sake
weâ€™ll
suppose
i
â€˜ave
wronged
â€˜im
and
now
â€˜im
and
â€˜is
friends
are
after
meâ€
â€œwho
are
his
friendsâ€
my
uncleâ€™s
boom
sank
suddenly
to
a
frightened
whisper
â€œsailorsâ€
said
he
â€œi
knew
they
would
come
when
i
saw
that
â€˜ere
paper
and
two
days
ago
i
looked
through
that
window
and
three
of
them
was
standinâ€™
lookinâ€™
at
the
â€˜ouse
it
was
after
that
that
i
wrote
to
your
mother
theyâ€™ve
marked
me
down
and
theyâ€™re
waitinâ€™
for
â€˜imâ€
â€œbut
why
not
send
for
the
policeâ€
my
uncleâ€™s
eyes
avoided
mine
â€œpolice
are
no
useâ€
said
he
â€œitâ€™s
you
that
can
help
meâ€
â€œwhat
can
i
doâ€
â€œiâ€™ll
tell
you
iâ€™m
going
to
move
thatâ€™s
what
all
these
boxes
are
for
everything
will
soon
be
packed
and
ready
i
â€˜ave
friends
at
leeds
and
i
shall
be
safer
there
not
safe
mind
you
but
safer
i
start
to-morrow
evening
and
if
you
will
stand
by
me
until
then
i
will
make
it
worth
your
while
thereâ€™s
only
enoch
and
me
to
do
everything
but
we
shall
â€˜ave
it
all
ready
i
promise
you
by
to-morrow
evening
the
cart
will
be
round
then
and
you
and
me
and
enoch
and
the
boy
william
can
guard
the
things
as
far
as
congleton
station
did
you
see
anything
of
them
on
the
fellsâ€
â€œyesâ€
said
i
â€œa
sailor
stopped
us
on
the
wayâ€
â€œah
i
knew
they
were
watching
us
that
was
why
i
asked
you
to
get
out
at
the
wrong
station
and
to
drive
to
purcellâ€™s
instead
of
cominâ€™
â€˜ere
we
are
blockadedâ€”thatâ€™s
the
wordâ€
â€œand
there
was
anotherâ€
said
i
â€œa
man
with
a
pipeâ€
â€œwhat
was
â€˜e
likeâ€
â€œthin
face
freckles
a
peakedâ€”â€”â€
my
uncle
gave
a
hoarse
scream
â€œthatâ€™s
â€˜im
thatâ€™s
â€˜im
â€˜eâ€™s
come
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinnerâ€
he
went
click-clacking
about
the
room
with
his
great
foot
like
one
distracted
there
was
something
piteous
and
baby-like
in
that
big
bald
head
and
for
the
first
time
i
felt
a
gush
of
pity
for
him
â€œcome
uncleâ€
said
i
â€œyou
are
living
in
a
civilized
land
there
is
a
law
that
will
bring
these
gentry
to
order
let
me
drive
over
to
the
county
police-station
to-morrow
morning
and
iâ€™ll
soon
set
things
rightâ€
but
he
shook
his
head
at
me
â€œeâ€™s
cunning
and
â€˜eâ€™s
cruelâ€
said
he
â€œi
canâ€™t
draw
a
breath
without
thinking
of
him
cos
â€˜e
buckled
up
three
of
my
ribs
â€˜eâ€™ll
kill
me
this
time
sure
thereâ€™s
only
one
chance
we
must
leave
what
we
â€˜ave
not
packed
and
we
must
be
off
first
thing
to-morrow
morninâ€™
great
god
whatâ€™s
thatâ€
a
tremendous
knock
upon
the
door
had
reverberated
through
the
house
and
then
another
and
another
an
iron
fist
seemed
to
be
beating
upon
it
my
uncle
collapsed
into
his
chair
i
seized
a
gun
and
ran
to
the
door
â€œwhoâ€™s
thereâ€
i
shouted
there
was
no
answer
i
opened
the
shutter
and
looked
out
no
one
was
there
and
then
suddenly
i
saw
that
a
long
slip
of
paper
was
protruding
through
the
slit
of
the
door
i
held
it
to
the
light
in
rude
but
vigorous
handwriting
the
message
ranâ€”
â€œput
them
out
on
the
doorstep
and
save
your
skinâ€
â€œwhat
do
they
wantâ€
i
asked
as
i
read
him
the
message
â€œwhat
theyâ€™ll
never
â€˜ave
no
by
the
lord
neverâ€
he
cried
with
a
fine
burst
of
spirit
â€œâ€˜ere
enoch
enochâ€
the
old
fellow
came
running
to
the
call
â€œenoch
iâ€™ve
been
a
good
master
to
you
all
my
life
and
itâ€™s
your
turn
now
will
you
take
a
risk
for
meâ€
i
thought
better
of
my
uncle
when
i
saw
how
readily
the
man
consented
whomever
else
he
had
wronged
this
one
at
least
seemed
to
love
him
â€œput
your
cloak
on
and
your
â€˜at
enoch
and
out
with
you
by
the
back
door
you
know
the
way
across
the
moor
to
the
purcellsâ€™
tell
them
that
i
must
â€˜ave
the
cart
first
thing
in
the
morninâ€™
and
that
purcell
must
come
with
the
shepherd
as
well
we
must
get
clear
of
this
or
we
are
done
first
thing
in
the
morninâ€™
enoch
and
ten
pound
for
the
job
keep
the
black
cloak
on
and
move
slow
and
they
will
never
see
you
weâ€™ll
keep
the
â€˜ouse
till
you
come
backâ€
it
was
a
job
for
a
brave
man
to
venture
out
into
the
vague
and
invisible
dangers
of
the
fell
but
the
old
servant
took
it
as
the
most
ordinary
of
messages
picking
his
long
black
cloak
and
his
soft
hat
from
the
hook
behind
the
door
he
was
ready
on
the
instant
we
extinguished
the
small
lamp
in
the
back
passage
softly
unbarred
the
back
door
slipped
him
out
and
barred
it
up
again
looking
through
the
small
hall
window
i
saw
his
black
garments
merge
instantly
into
the
night
â€œit
is
but
a
few
hours
before
the
light
comes
nephewâ€
said
my
uncle
after
he
had
tried
all
the
bolts
and
bars
â€œyou
shall
never
regret
this
nightâ€™s
work
if
we
come
through
safely
it
will
be
the
making
of
you
stand
by
me
till
morninâ€™
and
i
stand
by
you
while
thereâ€™s
breath
in
my
body
the
cart
will
be
â€˜ere
by
five
what
isnâ€™t
ready
we
can
afford
to
leave
beâ€™ind
weâ€™ve
only
to
load
up
and
make
for
the
early
train
at
congletonâ€
â€œwill
they
let
us
passâ€
â€œin
broad
daylight
they
dare
not
stop
us
there
will
be
six
of
us
if
they
all
come
and
three
guns
we
can
fight
our
way
through
where
can
they
get
guns
common
wandering
seamen
a
pistol
or
two
at
the
most
if
we
can
keep
them
out
for
a
few
hours
we
are
safe
enoch
must
be
â€˜alfway
to
purcellâ€™s
by
nowâ€
â€œbut
what
do
these
sailors
wantâ€
i
repeated
â€œyou
say
yourself
that
you
wronged
themâ€
a
look
of
mulish
obstinacy
came
over
his
large
white
face
â€œdonâ€™t
ask
questions
nephew
and
just
do
what
i
ask
youâ€
said
he
â€œenoch
wonâ€™t
come
back
â€˜eâ€™ll
just
bide
there
and
come
with
the
cart
â€˜ark
what
is
thatâ€
a
distant
cry
rang
from
out
of
the
darkness
and
then
another
one
short
and
sharp
like
the
wail
of
the
curlew
â€œitâ€™s
enochâ€
said
my
uncle
gripping
my
arm
â€œtheyâ€™re
killinâ€™
poor
old
enochâ€
the
cry
came
again
much
nearer
and
i
heard
the
sound
of
hurrying
steps
and
a
shrill
call
for
help
â€œthey
are
after
â€˜imâ€
cried
my
uncle
rushing
to
the
front
door
he
picked
up
the
lantern
and
flashed
it
through
the
little
shutter
up
the
yellow
funnel
of
light
a
man
was
running
frantically
his
head
bowed
and
a
black
cloak
fluttering
behind
him
the
moor
seemed
to
be
alive
with
dim
pursuers
â€œthe
bolt
the
boltâ€
gasped
my
uncle
he
pushed
it
back
whilst
i
turned
the
key
and
we
swung
the
door
open
to
admit
the
fugitive
he
dashed
in
and
turned
at
once
with
a
long
yell
of
triumph
â€œcome
on
lads
tumble
up
all
hands
tumble
up
smartly
there
all
of
youâ€
it
was
so
quickly
and
neatly
done
that
we
were
taken
by
storm
before
we
knew
that
we
were
attacked
the
passage
was
full
of
rushing
sailors
i
slipped
out
of
the
clutch
of
one
and
ran
for
my
gun
but
it
was
only
to
crash
down
on
to
the
stone
floor
an
instant
later
with
two
of
them
holding
on
to
me
they
were
so
deft
and
quick
that
my
hands
were
lashed
together
even
while
i
struggled
and
i
was
dragged
into
the
settle
corner
unhurt
but
very
sore
in
spirit
at
the
cunning
with
which
our
defences
had
been
forced
and
the
ease
with
which
we
had
been
overcome
they
had
not
even
troubled
to
bind
my
uncle
but
he
had
been
pushed
into
his
chair
and
the
guns
had
been
taken
away
he
sat
with
a
very
white
face
his
homely
figure
and
absurd
row
of
curls
looking
curiously
out
of
place
among
the
wild
figures
who
surrounded
him
there
were
six
of
them
all
evidently
sailors
one
i
recognized
as
the
man
with
the
earrings
whom
i
had
already
met
upon
the
road
that
evening
they
were
all
fine
weather-bronzed
bewhiskered
fellows
in
the
midst
of
them
leaning
against
the
table
was
the
freckled
man
who
had
passed
me
on
the
moor
the
great
black
cloak
which
poor
enoch
had
taken
out
with
him
was
still
hanging
from
his
shoulders
he
was
of
a
very
different
type
from
the
othersâ€”crafty
cruel
dangerous
with
sly
thoughtful
eyes
which
gloated
over
my
uncle
they
suddenly
turned
themselves
upon
me
and
i
never
knew
how
oneâ€™s
skin
can
creep
at
a
manâ€™s
glance
before
â€œwho
are
youâ€
he
asked
â€œspeak
out
or
weâ€™ll
find
a
way
to
make
youâ€
â€œi
am
mr
stephen
mapleâ€™s
nephew
come
to
visit
himâ€
â€œyou
are
are
you
well
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
uncle
and
of
your
visit
too
quickâ€™s
the
word
lads
for
we
must
be
aboard
before
morning
what
shall
we
do
with
the
old
â€˜unâ€
â€œtrice
him
up
yankee
fashion
and
give
him
six
dozenâ€
said
one
of
the
seamen
â€œdâ€™you
hear
you
cursed
cockney
thief
weâ€™ll
beat
the
life
out
of
you
if
you
donâ€™t
give
back
what
youâ€™ve
stolen
where
are
they
i
know
you
never
parted
with
themâ€
my
uncle
pursed
up
his
lips
and
shook
his
head
with
a
face
in
which
his
fear
and
his
obstinacy
contended
â€œwonâ€™t
tell
wonâ€™t
you
weâ€™ll
see
about
that
get
him
ready
jimâ€
one
of
the
seamen
seized
my
uncle
and
pulled
his
coat
and
shirt
over
his
shoulders
he
sat
lumped
in
his
chair
his
body
all
creased
into
white
rolls
which
shivered
with
cold
and
with
terror
â€œup
with
him
to
those
hooksâ€
there
were
rows
of
them
along
the
walls
where
the
smoked
meat
used
to
be
hung
the
seamen
tied
my
uncle
by
the
wrists
to
two
of
these
then
one
of
them
undid
his
leather
belt
â€œthe
buckle
end
jimâ€
said
the
captain
â€œgive
him
the
buckleâ€
â€œyou
cowardsâ€
i
cried
â€œto
beat
an
old
manâ€
â€œweâ€™ll
beat
a
young
one
nextâ€
said
he
with
a
malevolent
glance
at
my
corner
â€œnow
jim
cut
a
wad
out
of
himâ€
â€œgive
him
one
more
chanceâ€
cried
one
of
the
seamen
â€œaye
ayeâ€
growled
one
or
two
others
â€œgive
the
swab
a
chanceâ€
â€œif
you
turn
soft
you
may
give
them
up
for
everâ€
said
the
captain
â€œone
thing
or
the
other
you
must
lash
it
out
of
him
or
you
may
give
up
what
you
took
such
pains
to
win
and
what
would
make
you
gentlemen
for
lifeâ€”every
man
of
you
thereâ€™s
nothing
else
for
it
which
shall
it
beâ€
â€œlet
him
have
itâ€
they
cried
savagely
â€œthen
stand
clearâ€
the
buckle
of
the
manâ€™s
belt
whined
savagely
as
he
whirled
it
over
his
shoulder
but
my
uncle
cried
out
before
the
blow
fell
â€œi
canâ€™t
stand
itâ€
he
cried
â€œlet
me
downâ€
â€œwhere
are
they
thenâ€
â€œiâ€™ll
show
you
if
youâ€™ll
let
me
downâ€
they
cast
off
the
handkerchiefs
and
he
pulled
his
coat
over
his
fat
round
shoulders
the
seamen
stood
round
him
the
most
intense
curiosity
and
excitement
upon
their
swarthy
faces
â€œno
gammonâ€
cried
the
man
with
the
freckles
â€œweâ€™ll
kill
you
joint
by
joint
if
you
try
to
fool
us
now
then
where
are
theyâ€
â€œin
my
bedroomâ€
â€œwhere
is
thatâ€
â€œthe
room
aboveâ€
â€œwhereaboutsâ€
â€œin
the
corner
of
the
oak
ark
by
the
bedâ€
the
seamen
all
rushed
to
the
stair
but
the
captain
called
them
back
â€œwe
donâ€™t
leave
this
cunning
old
fox
behind
us
ha
your
face
drops
at
that
does
it
by
the
lord
i
believe
you
are
trying
to
slip
your
anchor
here
lads
make
him
fast
and
take
him
alongâ€
with
a
confused
trampling
of
feet
they
rushed
up
the
stairs
dragging
my
uncle
in
the
midst
of
them
for
an
instant
i
was
alone
my
hands
were
tied
but
not
my
feet
if
i
could
find
my
way
across
the
moor
i
might
rouse
the
police
and
intercept
these
rascals
before
they
could
reach
the
sea
for
a
moment
i
hesitated
as
to
whether
i
should
leave
my
uncle
alone
in
such
a
plight
but
i
should
be
of
more
service
to
himâ€”or
at
the
worst
to
his
propertyâ€”if
i
went
than
if
i
stayed
i
rushed
to
the
hall
door
and
as
i
reached
it
i
heard
a
yell
above
my
head
a
shattering
splintering
noise
and
then
amid
a
chorus
of
shouts
a
huge
weight
fell
with
a
horrible
thud
at
my
very
feet
never
while
i
live
will
that
squelching
thud
pass
out
of
my
ears
and
there
just
in
front
of
me
in
the
lane
of
light
cast
by
the
open
door
lay
my
unhappy
uncle
his
bald
head
twisted
on
to
one
shoulder
like
the
wrung
neck
of
a
chicken
it
needed
but
a
glance
to
see
that
his
spine
was
broken
and
that
he
was
dead
the
gang
of
seamen
had
rushed
downstairs
so
quickly
that
they
were
clustered
at
the
door
and
crowding
all
round
me
almost
as
soon
as
i
had
realized
what
had
occurred
â€œitâ€™s
no
doing
of
ours
mateâ€
said
one
of
them
to
me
â€œhe
hove
himself
through
the
window
and
thatâ€™s
the
truth
donâ€™t
you
put
it
down
to
usâ€
â€œhe
thought
he
could
get
to
windward
of
us
if
once
he
was
out
in
the
dark
you
seeâ€
said
another
â€œbut
he
came
head
foremost
and
broke
his
bloominâ€™
neckâ€
â€œand
a
blessed
good
job
tooâ€
cried
the
chief
with
a
savage
oath
â€œiâ€™d
have
done
it
for
him
if
he
hadnâ€™t
took
the
lead
donâ€™t
make
any
mistake
my
lads
this
is
murder
and
weâ€™re
all
in
it
together
thereâ€™s
only
one
way
out
of
it
and
that
is
to
hang
together
unless
as
the
saying
goes
you
mean
to
hang
apart
thereâ€™s
only
one
witnessâ€”â€”â€
he
looked
at
me
with
his
malicious
little
eyes
and
i
saw
that
he
had
something
that
gleamedâ€”either
a
knife
or
a
revolverâ€”in
the
breast
of
his
pea-jacket
two
of
the
men
slipped
between
us
â€œstow
that
captain
eliasâ€
said
one
of
them
â€œif
this
old
man
met
his
end
it
is
through
no
fault
of
ours
the
worst
we
ever
meant
him
was
to
take
some
of
the
skin
off
his
back
but
as
to
this
young
fellow
we
have
no
quarrel
with
himâ€”â€”â€
â€œyou
fool
you
may
have
no
quarrel
with
him
but
he
has
his
quarrel
with
you
heâ€™ll
swear
your
life
away
if
you
donâ€™t
silence
his
tongue
itâ€™s
his
life
or
ours
and
donâ€™t
you
make
any
mistakeâ€
â€œaye
aye
the
skipper
has
the
longest
head
of
any
of
us
better
do
what
he
tells
youâ€
cried
another
but
my
champion
who
was
the
fellow
with
the
earrings
covered
me
with
his
own
broad
chest
and
swore
roundly
that
no
one
should
lay
a
finger
on
me
the
others
were
equally
divided
and
my
fate
might
have
been
the
cause
of
a
quarrel
between
them
when
suddenly
the
captain
gave
a
cry
of
delight
and
amazement
which
was
taken
up
by
the
whole
gang
i
followed
their
eyes
and
outstretched
fingers
and
this
was
what
i
saw
my
uncle
was
lying
with
his
legs
outstretched
and
the
club
foot
was
that
which
was
furthest
from
us
all
round
this
foot
a
dozen
brilliant
objects
were
twinkling
and
flashing
in
the
yellow
light
which
streamed
from
the
open
door
the
captain
caught
up
the
lantern
and
held
it
to
the
place
the
huge
sole
of
his
boot
had
been
shattered
in
the
fall
and
it
was
clear
now
that
it
had
been
a
hollow
box
in
which
he
stowed
his
valuables
for
the
path
was
all
sprinkled
with
precious
stones
three
which
i
saw
were
of
an
unusual
size
and
as
many
as
forty
i
should
think
of
fair
value
the
seamen
had
cast
themselves
down
and
were
greedily
gathering
them
up
when
my
friend
with
the
earrings
plucked
me
by
the
sleeve
â€œhereâ€™s
your
chance
mateâ€
he
whispered
â€œoff
you
go
before
worse
comes
of
itâ€
it
was
a
timely
hint
and
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
act
upon
it
a
few
cautious
steps
and
i
had
passed
unobserved
beyond
the
circle
of
light
then
i
set
off
running
falling
and
rising
and
falling
again
for
no
one
who
has
not
tried
it
can
tell
how
hard
it
is
to
run
over
uneven
ground
with
hands
which
are
fastened
together
i
ran
and
ran
until
for
want
of
breath
i
could
no
longer
put
one
foot
before
the
other
but
i
need
not
have
hurried
so
for
when
i
had
gone
a
long
way
i
stopped
at
last
to
breathe
and
looking
back
i
could
still
see
the
gleam
of
the
lantern
far
away
and
the
outline
of
the
seamen
who
squatted
round
it
then
at
last
this
single
point
of
light
went
suddenly
out
and
the
whole
great
moor
was
left
in
the
thickest
darkness
so
deftly
was
i
tied
that
it
took
me
a
long
half-hour
and
a
broken
tooth
before
i
got
my
hands
free
my
idea
was
to
make
my
way
across
to
the
purcellsâ€™
farm
but
north
was
the
same
as
south
under
that
pitchy
sky
and
for
hours
i
wandered
among
the
rustling
scuttling
sheep
without
any
certainty
as
to
where
i
was
going
when
at
last
there
came
a
glimmer
in
the
east
and
the
undulating
fells
grey
with
the
morning
mist
rolled
once
more
to
the
horizon
i
recognized
that
i
was
close
by
purcellâ€™s
farm
and
there
a
little
in
front
of
me
i
was
startled
to
see
another
man
walking
in
the
same
direction
at
first
i
approached
him
warily
but
before
i
overtook
him
i
knew
by
the
bent
back
and
tottering
step
that
it
was
enoch
the
old
servant
and
right
glad
i
was
to
see
that
he
was
living
he
had
been
knocked
down
beaten
and
his
cloak
and
hat
taken
away
by
these
ruffians
and
all
night
he
had
wandered
in
the
darkness
like
myself
in
search
of
help
he
burst
into
tears
when
i
told
him
of
his
masterâ€™s
death
and
sat
hiccoughing
with
the
hard
dry
sobs
of
an
old
man
among
the
stones
upon
the
moor
â€œitâ€™s
the
men
of
the
black
mogulâ€
he
said
â€œyes
yes
i
knew
that
they
would
be
the
end
of
â€˜imâ€
â€œwho
are
theyâ€
i
asked
â€œwell
well
you
are
one
of
â€˜is
own
folkâ€
said
he
â€œâ€˜e
â€˜as
passed
away
yes
yes
it
is
all
over
and
done
i
can
tell
you
about
it
no
man
better
but
mumâ€™s
the
word
with
old
enoch
unless
master
wants
â€˜im
to
speak
but
his
own
nephew
who
came
to
â€˜elp
â€˜im
in
the
hour
of
needâ€”yes
yes
mister
john
you
ought
to
know
â€œit
was
like
this
sir
your
uncle
â€˜ad
â€˜is
grocerâ€™s
business
at
stepney
but
â€˜e
â€˜ad
another
business
also
â€˜e
would
buy
as
well
as
sell
and
when
â€˜e
bought
â€˜e
never
asked
no
questions
where
the
stuff
came
from
why
should
â€˜e
it
wasnâ€™t
no
business
of
â€˜is
was
it
if
folk
brought
him
a
stone
or
a
silver
plate
what
was
it
to
â€˜im
where
they
got
it
thatâ€™s
good
sense
and
it
ought
to
be
good
law
as
i
â€˜old
anyâ€™ow
it
was
good
enough
for
us
at
stepney
â€œwell
there
was
a
steamer
came
from
south
africa
what
foundered
at
sea
at
least
they
say
so
and
lloydâ€™s
paid
the
money
she
â€˜ad
some
very
fine
diamonds
invoiced
as
being
aboard
of
â€˜er
soon
after
there
came
the
brig
black
mogul
into
the
port
oâ€™
london
with
â€˜er
papers
all
right
as
â€˜avinâ€™
cleared
from
port
elizabeth
with
a
cargo
of
â€˜ides
the
captain
which
â€˜is
name
was
elias
â€˜e
came
to
see
the
master
and
what
dâ€™you
think
that
â€˜e
â€˜ad
to
sell
why
sir
as
iâ€™m
a
livinâ€™
sinner
â€˜e
â€˜ad
a
packet
of
diamonds
for
all
the
world
just
the
same
as
what
was
lost
out
oâ€™
that
there
african
steamer
â€˜ow
did
â€˜e
get
them
i
donâ€™t
know
master
didnâ€™t
know
â€˜e
didnâ€™t
seek
to
know
either
the
captain
â€˜e
was
anxious
for
reasons
of
â€˜is
own
to
get
them
safe
so
â€˜e
gave
them
to
master
same
as
you
might
put
a
thing
in
a
bank
but
master
â€˜eâ€™d
â€˜ad
time
to
get
fond
of
them
and
â€˜e
wasnâ€™t
over
satisfied
as
to
where
the
black
mogul
â€˜ad
been
tradinâ€™
or
where
her
captain
â€˜ad
got
the
stones
so
when
â€˜e
come
back
for
them
the
master
â€˜e
said
as
â€˜e
thought
they
were
best
in
â€˜is
own
â€˜ands
mind
i
donâ€™t
â€˜old
with
it
myself
but
that
was
what
master
said
to
captain
elias
in
the
little
back
parlour
at
stepney
that
was
â€˜ow
â€˜e
got
â€˜is
leg
broke
and
three
of
his
ribs
â€œso
the
captain
got
jugged
for
that
and
the
master
when
â€˜e
was
able
to
get
about
thought
that
â€˜e
would
â€˜ave
peace
for
fifteen
years
and
â€˜e
came
away
from
london
because
â€˜e
was
afraid
of
the
sailor
men
but
at
the
end
of
five
years
the
captain
was
out
and
after
â€˜im
with
as
many
of
â€˜is
crew
as
â€˜e
could
gather
send
for
the
perlice
you
says
well
there
are
two
sides
to
that
and
the
master
â€˜e
wasnâ€™t
much
more
fond
of
the
perlice
than
elias
was
but
they
fair
â€˜emmed
master
in
as
you
â€˜ave
seen
for
yourself
and
they
bested
â€˜im
at
last
and
the
loneliness
that
â€˜e
thought
would
be
â€˜is
safety
â€˜as
proved
â€˜is
ruin
well
well
â€˜e
was
â€˜ard
to
many
but
a
good
master
to
me
and
itâ€™s
long
before
i
come
on
such
anotherâ€
one
word
in
conclusion
a
strange
cutter
which
had
been
hanging
about
the
coast
was
seen
to
beat
down
the
irish
sea
that
morning
and
it
is
conjectured
that
elias
and
his
men
were
on
board
of
it
at
any
rate
nothing
has
been
heard
of
them
since
it
was
shown
at
the
inquest
that
my
uncle
had
lived
in
a
sordid
fashion
for
years
and
he
left
little
behind
him
the
mere
knowledge
that
he
possessed
this
treasure
which
he
carried
about
with
him
in
so
extraordinary
a
fashion
had
appeared
to
be
the
joy
of
his
life
and
he
had
never
as
far
as
we
could
learn
tried
to
realize
any
of
his
diamonds
so
his
disreputable
name
when
living
was
not
atoned
for
by
any
posthumous
benevolence
and
the
family
equally
scandalized
by
his
life
and
by
his
death
have
finally
buried
all
memory
of
the
club-footed
grocer
of
stepney
the
sealed
room
a
solicitor
of
an
active
habit
and
athletic
tastes
who
is
compelled
by
his
hopes
of
business
to
remain
within
the
four
walls
of
his
office
from
ten
till
five
must
take
what
exercise
he
can
in
the
evenings
hence
it
was
that
i
was
in
the
habit
of
indulging
in
very
long
nocturnal
excursions
in
which
i
sought
the
heights
of
hampstead
and
highgate
in
order
to
cleanse
my
system
from
the
impure
air
of
abchurch
lane
it
was
in
the
course
of
one
of
these
aimless
rambles
that
i
first
met
felix
stanniford
and
so
led
up
to
what
has
been
the
most
extraordinary
adventure
of
my
lifetime
one
eveningâ€”it
was
in
april
or
early
may
of
the
year
1894â€”i
made
my
way
to
the
extreme
northern
fringe
of
london
and
was
walking
down
one
of
those
fine
avenues
of
high
brick
villas
which
the
huge
city
is
for
ever
pushing
farther
and
farther
out
into
the
country
it
was
a
fine
clear
spring
night
the
moon
was
shining
out
of
an
unclouded
sky
and
i
having
already
left
many
miles
behind
me
was
inclined
to
walk
slowly
and
look
about
me
in
this
contemplative
mood
my
attention
was
arrested
by
one
of
the
houses
which
i
was
passing
it
was
a
very
large
building
standing
in
its
own
grounds
a
little
back
from
the
road
it
was
modern
in
appearance
and
yet
it
was
far
less
so
than
its
neighbours
all
of
which
were
crudely
and
painfully
new
their
symmetrical
line
was
broken
by
the
gap
caused
by
the
laurel-studded
lawn
with
the
great
dark
gloomy
house
looming
at
the
back
of
it
evidently
it
had
been
the
country
retreat
of
some
wealthy
merchant
built
perhaps
when
the
nearest
street
was
a
mile
off
and
now
gradually
overtaken
and
surrounded
by
the
red
brick
tentacles
of
the
london
octopus
the
next
stage
i
reflected
would
be
its
digestion
and
absorption
so
that
the
cheap
builder
might
rear
a
dozen
eighty-pound-a-year
villas
upon
the
garden
frontage
and
then
as
all
this
passed
vaguely
through
my
mind
an
incident
occurred
which
brought
my
thoughts
into
quite
another
channel
a
four-wheeled
cab
that
opprobrium
of
london
was
coming
jolting
and
creaking
in
one
direction
while
in
the
other
there
was
a
yellow
glare
from
the
lamp
of
a
cyclist
they
were
the
only
moving
objects
in
the
whole
long
moonlit
road
and
yet
they
crashed
into
each
other
with
that
malignant
accuracy
which
brings
two
ocean
liners
together
in
the
broad
waste
of
the
atlantic
it
was
the
cyclistâ€™s
fault
he
tried
to
cross
in
front
of
the
cab
miscalculated
his
distance
and
was
knocked
sprawling
by
the
horseâ€™s
shoulder
he
rose
snarling
the
cabman
swore
back
at
him
and
then
realizing
that
his
number
had
not
yet
been
taken
lashed
his
horse
and
lumbered
off
the
cyclist
caught
at
the
handles
of
his
prostrate
machine
and
then
suddenly
sat
down
with
a
groan
â€œoh
lordâ€
he
said
i
ran
across
the
road
to
his
side
â€œany
harm
doneâ€
i
asked
â€œitâ€™s
my
ankleâ€
said
he
â€œonly
a
twist
i
think
but
itâ€™s
pretty
painful
just
give
me
your
hand
will
youâ€
he
lay
in
the
yellow
circle
of
the
cycle
lamp
and
i
noted
as
i
helped
him
to
his
feet
that
he
was
a
gentlemanly
young
fellow
with
a
slight
dark
moustache
and
large
brown
eyes
sensitive
and
nervous
in
appearance
with
indications
of
weak
health
upon
his
sunken
cheeks
work
or
worry
had
left
its
traces
upon
his
thin
yellow
face
he
stood
up
when
i
pulled
his
hand
but
he
held
one
foot
in
the
air
and
he
groaned
as
he
moved
it
â€œi
canâ€™t
put
it
to
the
groundâ€
said
he
â€œwhere
do
you
liveâ€
â€œhereâ€
he
nodded
his
head
towards
the
big
dark
house
in
the
garden
â€œi
was
cutting
across
to
the
gate
when
that
confounded
cab
ran
into
me
could
you
help
me
so
farâ€
it
was
easily
done
i
put
his
cycle
inside
the
gate
and
then
i
supported
him
down
the
drive
and
up
the
steps
to
the
hall
door
there
was
not
a
light
anywhere
and
the
place
was
as
black
and
silent
as
if
no
one
had
ever
lived
in
it
â€œthat
will
do
thank
you
very
muchâ€
said
he
fumbling
with
his
key
in
the
lock
â€œno
you
must
allow
me
to
see
you
safeâ€
he
made
some
feeble
petulant
protest
and
then
realized
that
he
could
really
do
nothing
without
me
the
door
had
opened
into
a
pitch-dark
hall
he
lurched
forward
with
my
hand
still
on
his
arm
â€œthis
door
to
the
rightâ€
said
he
feeling
about
in
the
darkness
i
opened
the
door
and
at
the
same
moment
he
managed
to
strike
a
light
there
was
a
lamp
upon
the
table
and
we
lit
it
between
us
â€œnow
iâ€™m
all
right
you
can
leave
me
now
good-byeâ€
said
he
and
with
the
words
he
sat
down
in
the
arm-chair
and
fainted
dead
away
it
was
a
queer
position
for
me
the
fellow
looked
so
ghastly
that
really
i
was
not
sure
that
he
was
not
dead
presently
his
lips
quivered
and
his
breast
heaved
but
his
eyes
were
two
white
slits
and
his
colour
was
horrible
the
responsibility
was
more
than
i
could
stand
i
pulled
at
the
bell-rope
and
heard
the
bell
ringing
furiously
far
away
but
no
one
came
in
response
the
bell
tinkled
away
into
silence
which
no
murmur
or
movement
came
to
break
i
waited
and
rang
again
with
the
same
result
there
must
be
some
one
about
this
young
gentleman
could
not
live
all
alone
in
that
huge
house
his
people
ought
to
know
of
his
condition
if
they
would
not
answer
the
bell
i
must
hunt
them
out
myself
i
seized
the
lamp
and
rushed
from
the
room
what
i
saw
outside
amazed
me
the
hall
was
empty
the
stairs
were
bare
and
yellow
with
dust
there
were
three
doors
opening
into
spacious
rooms
and
each
was
uncarpeted
and
undraped
save
for
the
grey
webs
which
drooped
from
the
cornice
and
rosettes
of
lichen
which
had
formed
upon
the
walls
my
feet
reverberated
in
those
empty
and
silent
chambers
then
i
wandered
on
down
the
passage
with
the
idea
that
the
kitchens
at
least
might
be
tenanted
some
caretaker
might
lurk
in
some
secluded
room
no
they
were
all
equally
desolate
despairing
of
finding
any
help
i
ran
down
another
corridor
and
came
on
something
which
surprised
me
more
than
ever
the
passage
ended
in
a
large
brown
door
and
the
door
had
a
seal
of
red
wax
the
size
of
a
five-shilling
piece
over
the
keyhole
this
seal
gave
me
the
impression
of
having
been
there
for
a
long
time
for
it
was
dusty
and
discoloured
i
was
still
staring
at
it
and
wondering
what
that
door
might
conceal
when
i
heard
a
voice
calling
behind
me
and
running
back
found
my
young
man
sitting
up
in
his
chair
and
very
much
astonished
at
finding
himself
in
darkness
â€œwhy
on
earth
did
you
take
the
lamp
awayâ€
he
asked
â€œi
was
looking
for
assistanceâ€
â€œyou
might
look
for
some
timeâ€
said
he
â€œi
am
alone
in
the
houseâ€
â€œawkward
if
you
get
an
illnessâ€
â€œit
was
foolish
of
me
to
faint
i
inherit
a
weak
heart
from
my
mother
and
pain
or
emotion
has
that
effect
upon
me
it
will
carry
me
off
some
day
as
it
did
her
youâ€™re
not
a
doctor
are
youâ€
â€œno
a
lawyer
frank
alder
is
my
nameâ€
â€œmine
is
felix
stanniford
funny
that
i
should
meet
a
lawyer
for
my
friend
mr
perceval
was
saying
that
we
should
need
one
soonâ€
â€œvery
happy
i
am
sureâ€
â€œwell
that
will
depend
upon
him
you
know
did
you
say
that
you
had
run
with
that
lamp
all
over
the
ground
floorâ€
â€œyesâ€
â€œall
over
itâ€
he
asked
with
emphasis
and
he
looked
at
me
very
hard
â€œi
think
so
i
kept
on
hoping
that
i
should
find
someoneâ€
â€œdid
you
enter
all
the
roomsâ€
he
asked
with
the
same
intent
gaze
â€œwell
all
that
i
could
enterâ€
â€œoh
then
you
did
notice
itâ€
said
he
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
makes
the
best
of
a
bad
job
â€œnotice
whatâ€
â€œwhy
the
door
with
the
seal
on
itâ€
â€œyes
i
didâ€
â€œwerenâ€™t
you
curious
to
know
what
was
in
itâ€
â€œwell
it
did
strike
me
as
unusualâ€
â€œdo
you
think
you
could
go
on
living
alone
in
this
house
year
after
year
just
longing
all
the
time
to
know
what
is
at
the
other
side
of
that
door
and
yet
not
lookingâ€
â€œdo
you
mean
to
sayâ€
i
cried
â€œthat
you
donâ€™t
know
yourselfâ€
â€œno
more
than
you
doâ€
â€œthen
why
donâ€™t
you
lookâ€
â€œi
mustnâ€™tâ€
said
he
he
spoke
in
a
constrained
way
and
i
saw
that
i
had
blundered
on
to
some
delicate
ground
i
donâ€™t
know
that
i
am
more
inquisitive
than
my
neighbours
but
there
certainly
was
something
in
the
situation
which
appealed
very
strongly
to
my
curiosity
however
my
last
excuse
for
remaining
in
the
house
was
gone
now
that
my
companion
had
recovered
his
senses
i
rose
to
go
â€œare
you
in
a
hurryâ€
he
asked
â€œno
i
have
nothing
to
doâ€
â€œwell
i
should
be
very
glad
if
you
would
stay
with
me
a
little
the
fact
is
that
i
live
a
very
retired
and
secluded
life
here
i
donâ€™t
suppose
there
is
a
man
in
london
who
leads
such
a
life
as
i
do
it
is
quite
unusual
for
me
to
have
any
one
to
talk
withâ€
i
looked
round
at
the
little
room
scantily
furnished
with
a
sofa-bed
at
one
side
then
i
thought
of
the
great
bare
house
and
the
sinister
door
with
the
discoloured
red
seal
upon
it
there
was
something
queer
and
grotesque
in
the
situation
which
made
me
long
to
know
a
little
more
perhaps
i
should
if
i
waited
i
told
him
that
i
should
be
very
happy
â€œyou
will
find
the
spirits
and
a
siphon
upon
the
side
table
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
cannot
act
as
host
but
i
canâ€™t
get
across
the
room
those
are
cigars
in
the
tray
there
iâ€™ll
take
one
myself
i
think
and
so
you
are
a
solicitor
mr
alderâ€
â€œyesâ€
â€œand
i
am
nothing
i
am
that
most
helpless
of
living
creatures
the
son
of
a
millionaire
i
was
brought
up
with
the
expectation
of
great
wealth
and
here
i
am
a
poor
man
without
any
profession
at
all
and
then
on
the
top
of
it
all
i
am
left
with
this
great
mansion
on
my
hands
which
i
cannot
possibly
keep
up
isnâ€™t
it
an
absurd
situation
for
me
to
use
this
as
my
dwelling
is
like
a
coster
drawing
his
barrow
with
a
thoroughbred
a
donkey
would
be
more
useful
to
him
and
a
cottage
to
meâ€
â€œbut
why
not
sell
the
houseâ€
i
asked
â€œi
mustnâ€™tâ€
â€œlet
it
thenâ€
â€œno
i
mustnâ€™t
do
that
eitherâ€
i
looked
puzzled
and
my
companion
smiled
â€œiâ€™ll
tell
you
how
it
is
if
it
wonâ€™t
bore
youâ€
said
he
â€œon
the
contrary
i
should
be
exceedingly
interestedâ€
â€œi
think
after
your
kind
attention
to
me
i
cannot
do
less
than
relieve
any
curiosity
that
you
may
feel
you
must
know
that
my
father
was
stanislaus
stanniford
the
bankerâ€
stanniford
the
banker
i
remembered
the
name
at
once
his
flight
from
the
country
some
seven
years
before
had
been
one
of
the
scandals
and
sensations
of
the
time
â€œi
see
that
you
rememberâ€
said
my
companion
â€œmy
poor
father
left
the
country
to
avoid
numerous
friends
whose
savings
he
had
invested
in
an
unsuccessful
speculation
he
was
a
nervous
sensitive
man
and
the
responsibility
quite
upset
his
reason
he
had
committed
no
legal
offence
it
was
purely
a
matter
of
sentiment
he
would
not
even
face
his
own
family
and
he
died
among
strangers
without
ever
letting
us
know
where
he
wasâ€
â€œhe
diedâ€
said
i
â€œwe
could
not
prove
his
death
but
we
know
that
it
must
be
so
because
the
speculations
came
right
again
and
so
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
look
any
man
in
the
face
he
would
have
returned
if
he
were
alive
but
he
must
have
died
in
the
last
two
yearsâ€
â€œwhy
in
the
last
two
yearsâ€
â€œbecause
we
heard
from
him
two
years
agoâ€
â€œdid
he
not
tell
you
then
where
he
was
livingâ€
â€œthe
letter
came
from
paris
but
no
address
was
given
it
was
when
my
poor
mother
died
he
wrote
to
me
then
with
some
instructions
and
some
advice
and
i
have
never
heard
from
him
sinceâ€
â€œhad
you
heard
beforeâ€
â€œoh
yes
we
had
heard
before
and
thatâ€™s
where
our
mystery
of
the
sealed
door
upon
which
you
stumbled
to-night
has
its
origin
pass
me
that
desk
if
you
please
here
i
have
my
fatherâ€™s
letters
and
you
are
the
first
man
except
mr
perceval
who
has
seen
themâ€
â€œwho
is
mr
perceval
may
i
askâ€
â€œhe
was
my
fatherâ€™s
confidential
clerk
and
he
has
continued
to
be
the
friend
and
adviser
of
my
mother
and
then
of
myself
i
donâ€™t
know
what
we
should
have
done
without
perceval
he
saw
the
letters
but
no
one
else
this
is
the
first
one
which
came
on
the
very
day
when
my
father
fled
seven
years
ago
read
it
to
yourselfâ€
this
is
the
letter
which
i
readâ€”
â€œmy
ever
dearest
wifeâ€”
â€œsince
sir
william
told
me
how
weak
your
heart
is
and
how
harmful
any
shock
might
be
i
have
never
talked
about
my
business
affairs
to
you
the
time
has
come
when
at
all
risks
i
can
no
longer
refrain
from
telling
you
that
things
have
been
going
badly
with
me
this
will
cause
me
to
leave
you
for
a
little
time
but
it
is
with
the
absolute
assurance
that
we
shall
see
each
other
very
soon
on
this
you
can
thoroughly
rely
our
parting
is
only
for
a
very
short
time
my
own
darling
so
donâ€™t
let
it
fret
you
and
above
all
donâ€™t
let
it
impair
your
health
for
that
is
what
i
want
above
all
things
to
avoid
â€œnow
i
have
a
request
to
make
and
i
implore
you
by
all
that
binds
us
together
to
fulfil
it
exactly
as
i
tell
you
there
are
some
things
which
i
do
not
wish
to
be
seen
by
any
one
in
my
dark
roomâ€”the
room
which
i
use
for
photographic
purposes
at
the
end
of
the
garden
passage
to
prevent
any
painful
thoughts
i
may
assure
you
once
for
all
dear
that
it
is
nothing
of
which
i
need
be
ashamed
but
still
i
do
not
wish
you
or
felix
to
enter
that
room
it
is
locked
and
i
implore
you
when
you
receive
this
to
at
once
place
a
seal
over
the
lock
and
leave
it
so
do
not
sell
or
let
the
house
for
in
either
case
my
secret
will
be
discovered
as
long
as
you
or
felix
are
in
the
house
i
know
that
you
will
comply
with
my
wishes
when
felix
is
twenty-one
he
may
enter
the
roomâ€”not
before
â€œand
now
good-bye
my
own
best
of
wives
during
our
short
separation
you
can
consult
mr
perceval
on
any
matters
which
may
arise
he
has
my
complete
confidence
i
hate
to
leave
felix
and
youâ€”even
for
a
timeâ€”but
there
is
really
no
choice
â€œever
and
always
your
loving
husband
stanislaus
stanniford
â€œjune
4th
1887â€
â€œthese
are
very
private
family
matters
for
me
to
inflict
upon
youâ€
said
my
companion
apologetically
â€œyou
must
look
upon
it
as
done
in
your
professional
capacity
i
have
wanted
to
speak
about
it
for
yearsâ€
â€œi
am
honoured
by
your
confidenceâ€
i
answered
â€œand
exceedingly
interested
by
the
factsâ€
â€œmy
father
was
a
man
who
was
noted
for
his
almost
morbid
love
of
truth
he
was
always
pedantically
accurate
when
he
said
therefore
that
he
hoped
to
see
my
mother
very
soon
and
when
he
said
that
he
had
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
that
dark
room
you
may
rely
upon
it
that
he
meant
itâ€
â€œthen
what
can
it
beâ€
i
ejaculated
â€œneither
my
mother
nor
i
could
imagine
we
carried
out
his
wishes
to
the
letter
and
placed
the
seal
upon
the
door
there
it
has
been
ever
since
my
mother
lived
for
five
years
after
my
fatherâ€™s
disappearance
although
at
the
time
all
the
doctors
said
that
she
could
not
survive
long
her
heart
was
terribly
diseased
during
the
first
few
months
she
had
two
letters
from
my
father
both
had
the
paris
post-mark
but
no
address
they
were
short
and
to
the
same
effect
that
they
would
soon
be
reunited
and
that
she
should
not
fret
then
there
was
a
silence
which
lasted
until
her
death
and
then
came
a
letter
to
me
of
so
private
a
nature
that
i
cannot
show
it
to
you
begging
me
never
to
think
evil
of
him
giving
me
much
good
advice
and
saying
that
the
sealing
of
the
room
was
of
less
importance
now
than
during
the
lifetime
of
my
mother
but
that
the
opening
might
still
cause
pain
to
others
and
that
therefore
he
thought
it
best
that
it
should
be
postponed
until
my
twenty-first
year
for
the
lapse
of
time
would
make
things
easier
in
the
meantime
he
committed
the
care
of
the
room
to
me
so
now
you
can
understand
how
it
is
that
although
i
am
a
very
poor
man
i
can
neither
let
nor
sell
this
great
houseâ€
â€œyou
could
mortgage
itâ€
â€œmy
father
had
already
done
soâ€
â€œit
is
a
most
singular
state
of
affairsâ€
â€œmy
mother
and
i
were
gradually
compelled
to
sell
the
furniture
and
to
dismiss
the
servants
until
now
as
you
see
i
am
living
unattended
in
a
single
room
but
i
have
only
two
more
monthsâ€
â€œwhat
do
you
meanâ€
â€œwhy
that
in
two
months
i
come
of
age
the
first
thing
that
i
do
will
be
to
open
that
door
the
second
to
get
rid
of
the
houseâ€
â€œwhy
should
your
father
have
continued
to
stay
away
when
these
investments
had
recovered
themselvesâ€
â€œhe
must
be
deadâ€
â€œyou
say
that
he
had
not
committed
any
legal
offence
when
he
fled
the
countryâ€
â€œnoneâ€
â€œwhy
should
he
not
take
your
mother
with
himâ€
â€œi
do
not
knowâ€
â€œwhy
should
he
conceal
his
addressâ€
â€œi
do
not
knowâ€
â€œwhy
should
he
allow
your
mother
to
die
and
be
buried
without
coming
backâ€
â€œi
do
not
knowâ€
â€œmy
dear
sirâ€
said
i
â€œif
i
may
speak
with
the
frankness
of
a
professional
adviser
i
should
say
that
it
is
very
clear
that
your
father
had
the
strongest
reasons
for
keeping
out
of
the
country
and
that
if
nothing
has
been
proved
against
him
he
at
least
thought
that
something
might
be
and
refused
to
put
himself
within
the
power
of
the
law
surely
that
must
be
obvious
for
in
what
other
possible
way
can
the
facts
be
explainedâ€
my
companion
did
not
take
my
suggestion
in
good
part
â€œyou
had
not
the
advantage
of
knowing
my
father
mr
alderâ€
he
said
coldly
â€œi
was
only
a
boy
when
he
left
us
but
i
shall
always
look
upon
him
as
my
ideal
man
his
only
fault
was
that
he
was
too
sensitive
and
too
unselfish
that
any
one
should
lose
money
through
him
would
cut
him
to
the
heart
his
sense
of
honour
was
most
acute
and
any
theory
of
his
disappearance
which
conflicts
with
that
is
a
mistaken
oneâ€
it
pleased
me
to
hear
the
lad
speak
out
so
roundly
and
yet
i
knew
that
the
facts
were
against
him
and
that
he
was
incapable
of
taking
an
unprejudiced
view
of
the
situation
â€œi
only
speak
as
an
outsiderâ€
said
i
â€œand
now
i
must
leave
you
for
i
have
a
long
walk
before
me
your
story
has
interested
me
so
much
that
i
should
be
glad
if
you
could
let
me
know
the
sequelâ€
â€œleave
me
your
cardâ€
said
he
and
so
having
bade
him
â€œgood-nightâ€
i
left
him
i
heard
nothing
more
of
the
matter
for
some
time
and
had
almost
feared
that
it
would
prove
to
be
one
of
those
fleeting
experiences
which
drift
away
from
our
direct
observation
and
end
only
in
a
hope
or
a
suspicion
one
afternoon
however
a
card
bearing
the
name
of
mr
j
h
perceval
was
brought
up
to
my
office
in
abchurch
lane
and
its
bearer
a
small
dry
bright-eyed
fellow
of
fifty
was
ushered
in
by
the
clerk
â€œi
believe
sirâ€
said
he
â€œthat
my
name
has
been
mentioned
to
you
by
my
young
friend
mr
felix
stannifordâ€
â€œof
courseâ€
i
answered
â€œi
rememberâ€
â€œhe
spoke
to
you
i
understand
about
the
circumstances
in
connection
with
the
disappearance
of
my
former
employer
mr
stanislaus
stanniford
and
the
existence
of
a
sealed
room
in
his
former
residenceâ€
â€œhe
didâ€
â€œand
you
expressed
an
interest
in
the
matterâ€
â€œit
interested
me
extremelyâ€
â€œyou
are
aware
that
we
hold
mr
stannifordâ€™s
permission
to
open
the
door
on
the
twenty-first
birthday
of
his
sonâ€
â€œi
rememberâ€
â€œthe
twenty-first
birthday
is
to-dayâ€
â€œhave
you
opened
itâ€
i
asked
eagerly
â€œnot
yet
sirâ€
said
he
gravely
â€œi
have
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
be
well
to
have
witnesses
present
when
that
door
is
opened
you
are
a
lawyer
and
you
are
acquainted
with
the
facts
will
you
be
present
on
the
occasionâ€
â€œmost
certainlyâ€
â€œyou
are
employed
during
the
day
and
so
am
i
shall
we
meet
at
nine
oâ€™clock
at
the
houseâ€
â€œi
will
come
with
pleasureâ€
â€œthen
you
will
find
us
waiting
for
you
good-bye
for
the
presentâ€
he
bowed
solemnly
and
took
his
leave
i
kept
my
appointment
that
evening
with
a
brain
which
was
weary
with
fruitless
attempts
to
think
out
some
plausible
explanation
of
the
mystery
which
we
were
about
to
solve
mr
perceval
and
my
young
acquaintance
were
waiting
for
me
in
the
little
room
i
was
not
surprised
to
see
the
young
man
looking
pale
and
nervous
but
i
was
rather
astonished
to
find
the
dry
little
city
man
in
a
state
of
intense
though
partially
suppressed
excitement
his
cheeks
were
flushed
his
hands
twitching
and
he
could
not
stand
still
for
an
instant
stanniford
greeted
me
warmly
and
thanked
me
many
times
for
having
come
â€œand
now
percevalâ€
said
he
to
his
companion
â€œi
suppose
there
is
no
obstacle
to
our
putting
the
thing
through
without
delay
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
it
overâ€
the
bankerâ€™s
clerk
took
up
the
lamp
and
led
the
way
but
he
paused
in
the
passage
outside
the
door
and
his
hand
was
shaking
so
that
the
light
flickered
up
and
down
the
high
bare
walls
â€œmr
stannifordâ€
said
he
in
a
cracking
voice
â€œi
hope
you
will
prepare
yourself
in
case
any
shock
should
be
awaiting
you
when
that
seal
is
removed
and
the
door
is
openedâ€
â€œwhat
could
there
be
perceval
you
are
trying
to
frighten
meâ€
â€œno
mr
stanniford
but
i
should
wish
you
to
be
ready

to
be
braced
up

not
to
allow
yourselfâ€
he
had
to
lick
his
dry
lips
between
every
jerky
sentence
and
i
suddenly
realized
as
clearly
as
if
he
had
told
me
that
he
knew
what
was
behind
that
closed
door
and
that
it
was
something
terrible
â€œhere
are
the
keys
mr
stanniford
but
remember
my
warningâ€
he
had
a
bunch
of
assorted
keys
in
his
hand
and
the
young
man
snatched
them
from
him
then
he
thrust
a
knife
under
the
discoloured
red
seal
and
jerked
it
off
the
lamp
was
rattling
and
shaking
in
percevalâ€™s
hands
so
i
took
it
from
him
and
held
it
near
the
key
hole
while
stanniford
tried
key
after
key
at
last
one
turned
in
the
lock
the
door
flew
open
he
took
one
step
into
the
room
and
then
with
a
horrible
cry
the
young
man
fell
senseless
at
our
feet
if
i
had
not
given
heed
to
the
clerkâ€™s
warning
and
braced
myself
for
a
shock
i
should
certainly
have
dropped
the
lamp
the
room
windowless
and
bare
was
fitted
up
as
a
photographic
laboratory
with
a
tap
and
sink
at
the
side
of
it
a
shelf
of
bottles
and
measures
stood
at
one
side
and
a
peculiar
heavy
smell
partly
chemical
partly
animal
filled
the
air
a
single
table
and
chair
were
in
front
of
us
and
at
this
with
his
back
turned
towards
us
a
man
was
seated
in
the
act
of
writing
his
outline
and
attitude
were
as
natural
as
life
but
as
the
light
fell
upon
him
it
made
my
hair
rise
to
see
that
the
nape
of
his
neck
was
black
and
wrinkled
and
no
thicker
than
my
wrist
dust
lay
upon
himâ€”thick
yellow
dustâ€”upon
his
hair
his
shoulders
his
shrivelled
lemon-coloured
hands
his
head
had
fallen
forward
upon
his
breast
his
pen
still
rested
upon
a
discoloured
sheet
of
paper
â€œmy
poor
master
my
poor
poor
masterâ€
cried
the
clerk
and
the
tears
were
running
down
his
cheeks
â€œwhatâ€
i
cried
â€œmr
stanislaus
stannifordâ€
â€œhere
he
has
sat
for
seven
years
oh
why
would
he
do
it
i
begged
him
i
implored
him
i
went
on
my
knees
to
him
but
he
would
have
his
way
you
see
the
key
on
the
table
he
had
locked
the
door
upon
the
inside
and
he
has
written
something
we
must
take
itâ€
â€œyes
yes
take
it
and
for
godâ€™s
sake
let
us
get
out
of
thisâ€
i
cried
â€œthe
air
is
poisonous
come
stanniford
comeâ€
taking
an
arm
each
we
half
led
and
half
carried
the
terrified
man
back
to
his
own
room
â€œit
was
my
fatherâ€
he
cried
as
he
recovered
his
consciousness
â€œhe
is
sitting
there
dead
in
his
chair
you
knew
it
perceval
this
was
what
you
meant
when
you
warned
meâ€
â€œyes
i
knew
it
mr
stanniford
i
have
acted
for
the
best
all
along
but
my
position
has
been
a
terribly
difficult
one
for
seven
years
i
have
known
that
your
father
was
dead
in
that
roomâ€
â€œyou
knew
it
and
never
told
usâ€
â€œdonâ€™t
be
harsh
with
me
mr
stanniford
sir
make
allowance
for
a
man
who
has
had
a
hard
part
to
playâ€
â€œmy
head
is
swimming
round
i
cannot
grasp
itâ€
he
staggered
up
and
helped
himself
from
the
brandy
bottle
â€œthese
letters
to
my
mother
and
to
myselfâ€”were
they
forgeriesâ€
â€œno
sir
your
father
wrote
them
and
addressed
them
and
left
them
in
my
keeping
to
be
posted
i
have
followed
his
instructions
to
the
very
letter
in
all
things
he
was
my
master
and
i
have
obeyed
himâ€
the
brandy
had
steadied
the
young
manâ€™s
shaken
nerves
â€œtell
me
about
it
i
can
stand
it
nowâ€
said
he
â€œwell
mr
stanniford
you
know
that
at
one
time
there
came
a
period
of
great
trouble
upon
your
father
and
he
thought
that
many
poor
people
were
about
to
lose
their
savings
through
his
fault
he
was
a
man
who
was
so
tender-hearted
that
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
it
worried
him
and
tormented
him
until
he
determined
to
end
his
life
oh
mr
stanniford
if
you
knew
how
i
have
prayed
him
and
wrestled
with
him
over
it
you
would
never
blame
me
and
he
in
turn
prayed
me
as
no
man
has
ever
prayed
me
before
he
had
made
up
his
mind
and
he
would
do
it
in
any
case
he
said
but
it
rested
with
me
whether
his
death
should
be
happy
and
easy
or
whether
it
should
be
most
miserable
i
read
in
his
eyes
that
he
meant
what
he
said
and
at
last
i
yielded
to
his
prayers
and
i
consented
to
do
his
will
â€œwhat
was
troubling
him
was
this
he
had
been
told
by
the
first
doctor
in
london
that
his
wifeâ€™s
heart
would
fail
at
the
slightest
shock
he
had
a
horror
of
accelerating
her
end
and
yet
his
own
existence
had
become
unendurable
to
him
how
could
he
end
himself
without
injuring
her
â€œyou
know
now
the
course
that
he
took
he
wrote
the
letter
which
she
received
there
was
nothing
in
it
which
was
not
literally
true
when
he
spoke
of
seeing
her
again
so
soon
he
was
referring
to
her
own
approaching
death
which
he
had
been
assured
could
not
be
delayed
more
than
a
very
few
months
so
convinced
was
he
of
this
that
he
only
left
two
letters
to
be
forwarded
at
intervals
after
his
death
she
lived
five
years
and
i
had
no
letters
to
send
â€œhe
left
another
letter
with
me
to
be
sent
to
you
sir
upon
the
occasion
of
the
death
of
your
mother
i
posted
all
these
in
paris
to
sustain
the
idea
of
his
being
abroad
it
was
his
wish
that
i
should
say
nothing
and
i
have
said
nothing
i
have
been
a
faithful
servant
seven
years
after
his
death
he
thought
no
doubt
that
the
shock
to
the
feelings
of
his
surviving
friends
would
be
lessened
he
was
always
considerate
for
othersâ€
there
was
silence
for
some
time
it
was
broken
by
young
stanniford
â€œi
cannot
blame
you
perceval
you
have
spared
my
mother
a
shock
which
would
certainly
have
broken
her
heart
what
is
that
paperâ€
â€œit
is
what
your
father
was
writing
sir
shall
i
read
it
to
youâ€
â€œdo
soâ€
â€œâ€˜i
have
taken
the
poison
and
i
feel
it
working
in
my
veins
it
is
strange
but
not
painful
when
these
words
are
read
i
shall
if
my
wishes
have
been
faithfully
carried
out
have
been
dead
many
years
surely
no
one
who
has
lost
money
through
me
will
still
bear
me
animosity
and
you
felix
you
will
forgive
me
this
family
scandal
may
god
find
rest
for
a
sorely
wearied
spiritâ€™â€
â€œamenâ€
we
cried
all
three
the
brazilian
cat
it
is
hard
luck
on
a
young
fellow
to
have
expensive
tastes
great
expectations
aristocratic
connections
but
no
actual
money
in
his
pocket
and
no
profession
by
which
he
may
earn
any
the
fact
was
that
my
father
a
good
sanguine
easy-going
man
had
such
confidence
in
the
wealth
and
benevolence
of
his
bachelor
elder
brother
lord
southerton
that
he
took
it
for
granted
that
i
his
only
son
would
never
be
called
upon
to
earn
a
living
for
myself
he
imagined
that
if
there
were
not
a
vacancy
for
me
on
the
great
southerton
estates
at
least
there
would
be
found
some
post
in
that
diplomatic
service
which
still
remains
the
special
preserve
of
our
privileged
classes
he
died
too
early
to
realize
how
false
his
calculations
had
been
neither
my
uncle
nor
the
state
took
the
slightest
notice
of
me
or
showed
any
interest
in
my
career
an
occasional
brace
of
pheasants
or
basket
of
hares
was
all
that
ever
reached
me
to
remind
me
that
i
was
heir
to
otwell
house
and
one
of
the
richest
estates
in
the
country
in
the
meantime
i
found
myself
a
bachelor
and
man
about
town
living
in
a
suite
of
apartments
in
grosvenor
mansions
with
no
occupation
save
that
of
pigeon-shooting
and
polo-playing
at
hurlingham
month
by
month
i
realized
that
it
was
more
and
more
difficult
to
get
the
brokers
to
renew
my
bills
or
to
cash
any
further
post-obits
upon
an
unentailed
property
ruin
lay
right
across
my
path
and
every
day
i
saw
it
clearer
nearer
and
more
absolutely
unavoidable
what
made
me
feel
my
own
poverty
the
more
was
that
apart
from
the
great
wealth
of
lord
southerton
all
my
other
relations
were
fairly
well-to-do
the
nearest
of
these
was
everard
king
my
fatherâ€™s
nephew
and
my
own
first
cousin
who
had
spent
an
adventurous
life
in
brazil
and
had
now
returned
to
this
country
to
settle
down
on
his
fortune
we
never
knew
how
he
made
his
money
but
he
appeared
to
have
plenty
of
it
for
he
bought
the
estate
of
greylands
near
clipton-on-the-marsh
in
suffolk
for
the
first
year
of
his
residence
in
england
he
took
no
more
notice
of
me
than
my
miserly
uncle
but
at
last
one
summer
morning
to
my
very
great
relief
and
joy
i
received
a
letter
asking
me
to
come
down
that
very
day
and
spend
a
short
visit
at
greylands
court
i
was
expecting
a
rather
long
visit
to
bankruptcy
court
at
the
time
and
this
interruption
seemed
almost
providential
if
i
could
only
get
on
terms
with
this
unknown
relative
of
mine
i
might
pull
through
yet
for
the
family
credit
he
could
not
let
me
go
entirely
to
the
wall
i
ordered
my
valet
to
pack
my
valise
and
i
set
off
the
same
evening
for
clipton-on-the-marsh
after
changing
at
ipswich
a
little
local
train
deposited
me
at
a
small
deserted
station
lying
amidst
a
rolling
grassy
country
with
a
sluggish
and
winding
river
curving
in
and
out
amidst
the
valleys
between
high
silted
banks
which
showed
that
we
were
within
reach
of
the
tide
no
carriage
was
awaiting
me
i
found
afterwards
that
my
telegram
had
been
delayed
so
i
hired
a
dog-cart
at
the
local
inn
the
driver
an
excellent
fellow
was
full
of
my
relativeâ€™s
praises
and
i
learned
from
him
that
mr
everard
king
was
already
a
name
to
conjure
with
in
that
part
of
the
country
he
had
entertained
the
school-children
he
had
thrown
his
grounds
open
to
visitors
he
had
subscribed
to
charitiesâ€”in
short
his
benevolence
had
been
so
universal
that
my
driver
could
only
account
for
it
on
the
supposition
that
he
had
parliamentary
ambitions
my
attention
was
drawn
away
from
my
driverâ€™s
panegyric
by
the
appearance
of
a
very
beautiful
bird
which
settled
on
a
telegraph-post
beside
the
road
at
first
i
thought
that
it
was
a
jay
but
it
was
larger
with
a
brighter
plumage
the
driver
accounted
for
its
presence
at
once
by
saying
that
it
belonged
to
the
very
man
whom
we
were
about
to
visit
it
seems
that
the
acclimatization
of
foreign
creatures
was
one
of
his
hobbies
and
that
he
had
brought
with
him
from
brazil
a
number
of
birds
and
beasts
which
he
was
endeavouring
to
rear
in
england
when
once
we
had
passed
the
gates
of
greylands
park
we
had
ample
evidence
of
this
taste
of
his
some
small
spotted
deer
a
curious
wild
pig
known
i
believe
as
a
peccary
a
gorgeously
feathered
oriole
some
sort
of
armadillo
and
a
singular
lumbering
intoed
beast
like
a
very
fat
badger
were
among
the
creatures
which
i
observed
as
we
drove
along
the
winding
avenue
mr
everard
king
my
unknown
cousin
was
standing
in
person
upon
the
steps
of
his
house
for
he
had
seen
us
in
the
distance
and
guessed
that
it
was
i
his
appearance
was
very
homely
and
benevolent
short
and
stout
forty-five
years
old
perhaps
with
a
round
good-humoured
face
burned
brown
with
the
tropical
sun
and
shot
with
a
thousand
wrinkles
he
wore
white
linen
clothes
in
true
planter
style
with
a
cigar
between
his
lips
and
a
large
panama
hat
upon
the
back
of
his
head
it
was
such
a
figure
as
one
associates
with
a
verandahed
bungalow
and
it
looked
curiously
out
of
place
in
front
of
this
broad
stone
english
mansion
with
its
solid
wings
and
its
palladio
pillars
before
the
doorway
â€œmy
dearâ€
he
cried
glancing
over
his
shoulder
â€œmy
dear
here
is
our
guest
welcome
welcome
to
greylands
i
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
cousin
marshall
and
i
take
it
as
a
great
compliment
that
you
should
honour
this
sleepy
little
country
place
with
your
presenceâ€
nothing
could
be
more
hearty
than
his
manner
and
he
set
me
at
my
ease
in
an
instant
but
it
needed
all
his
cordiality
to
atone
for
the
frigidity
and
even
rudeness
of
his
wife
a
tall
haggard
woman
who
came
forward
at
his
summons
she
was
i
believe
of
brazilian
extraction
though
she
spoke
excellent
english
and
i
excused
her
manners
on
the
score
of
her
ignorance
of
our
customs
she
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
however
either
then
or
afterwards
that
i
was
no
very
welcome
visitor
at
greylands
court
her
actual
words
were
as
a
rule
courteous
but
she
was
the
possessor
of
a
pair
of
particularly
expressive
dark
eyes
and
i
read
in
them
very
clearly
from
the
first
that
she
heartily
wished
me
back
in
london
once
more
however
my
debts
were
too
pressing
and
my
designs
upon
my
wealthy
relative
were
too
vital
for
me
to
allow
them
to
be
upset
by
the
ill-temper
of
his
wife
so
i
disregarded
her
coldness
and
reciprocated
the
extreme
cordiality
of
his
welcome
no
pains
had
been
spared
by
him
to
make
me
comfortable
my
room
was
a
charming
one
he
implored
me
to
tell
him
anything
which
could
add
to
my
happiness
it
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
inform
him
that
a
blank
cheque
would
materially
help
towards
that
end
but
i
felt
that
it
might
be
premature
in
the
present
state
of
our
acquaintance
the
dinner
was
excellent
and
as
we
sat
together
afterwards
over
his
havanas
and
coffee
which
latter
he
told
me
was
specially
prepared
upon
his
own
plantation
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
my
driverâ€™s
eulogies
were
justified
and
that
i
had
never
met
a
more
large-hearted
and
hospitable
man
but
in
spite
of
his
cheery
good
nature
he
was
a
man
with
a
strong
will
and
a
fiery
temper
of
his
own
of
this
i
had
an
example
upon
the
following
morning
the
curious
aversion
which
mrs
everard
king
had
conceived
towards
me
was
so
strong
that
her
manner
at
breakfast
was
almost
offensive
but
her
meaning
became
unmistakable
when
her
husband
had
quitted
the
room
â€œthe
best
train
in
the
day
is
at
twelve
fifteenâ€
said
she
â€œbut
i
was
not
thinking
of
going
to-dayâ€
i
answered
franklyâ€”perhaps
even
defiantly
for
i
was
determined
not
to
be
driven
out
by
this
woman
â€œoh
if
it
rests
with
youâ€”â€”â€
said
she
and
stopped
with
a
most
insolent
expression
in
her
eyes
â€œi
am
sureâ€
i
answered
â€œthat
mr
everard
king
would
tell
me
if
i
were
outstaying
my
welcomeâ€
â€œwhatâ€™s
this
whatâ€™s
thisâ€
said
a
voice
and
there
he
was
in
the
room
he
had
overheard
my
last
words
and
a
glance
at
our
faces
had
told
him
the
rest
in
an
instant
his
chubby
cheery
face
set
into
an
expression
of
absolute
ferocity
â€œmight
i
trouble
you
to
walk
outside
marshallâ€
said
he
i
may
mention
that
my
own
name
is
marshall
king
he
closed
the
door
behind
me
and
then
for
an
instant
i
heard
him
talking
in
a
low
voice
of
concentrated
passion
to
his
wife
this
gross
breach
of
hospitality
had
evidently
hit
upon
his
tenderest
point
i
am
no
eavesdropper
so
i
walked
out
on
to
the
lawn
presently
i
heard
a
hurried
step
behind
me
and
there
was
the
lady
her
face
pale
with
excitement
and
her
eyes
red
with
tears
â€œmy
husband
has
asked
me
to
apologize
to
you
mr
marshall
kingâ€
said
she
standing
with
downcast
eyes
before
me
â€œplease
do
not
say
another
word
mrs
kingâ€
her
dark
eyes
suddenly
blazed
out
at
me
â€œyou
foolâ€
she
hissed
with
frantic
vehemence
and
turning
on
her
heel
swept
back
to
the
house
the
insult
was
so
outrageous
so
insufferable
that
i
could
only
stand
staring
after
her
in
bewilderment
i
was
still
there
when
my
host
joined
me
he
was
his
cheery
chubby
self
once
more
â€œi
hope
that
my
wife
has
apologized
for
her
foolish
remarksâ€
said
he
â€œoh
yesâ€”yes
certainlyâ€
he
put
his
hand
through
my
arm
and
walked
with
me
up
and
down
the
lawn
â€œyou
must
not
take
it
seriouslyâ€
said
he
â€œit
would
grieve
me
inexpressibly
if
you
curtailed
your
visit
by
one
hour
the
fact
isâ€”there
is
no
reason
why
there
should
be
any
concealment
between
relativesâ€”that
my
poor
dear
wife
is
incredibly
jealous
she
hates
that
any
oneâ€”male
or
femaleâ€”should
for
an
instant
come
between
us
her
ideal
is
a
desert
island
and
an
eternal
tãªte-ã
-tãªte
that
gives
you
the
clue
to
her
actions
which
are
i
confess
upon
this
particular
point
not
very
far
removed
from
mania
tell
me
that
you
will
think
no
more
of
itâ€
â€œno
no
certainly
notâ€
â€œthen
light
this
cigar
and
come
round
with
me
and
see
my
little
menagerieâ€
the
whole
afternoon
was
occupied
by
this
inspection
which
included
all
the
birds
beasts
and
even
reptiles
which
he
had
imported
some
were
free
some
in
cages
a
few
actually
in
the
house
he
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
his
successes
and
his
failures
his
births
and
his
deaths
and
he
would
cry
out
in
his
delight
like
a
schoolboy
when
as
we
walked
some
gaudy
bird
would
flutter
up
from
the
grass
or
some
curious
beast
slink
into
the
cover
finally
he
led
me
down
a
corridor
which
extended
from
one
wing
of
the
house
at
the
end
of
this
there
was
a
heavy
door
with
a
sliding
shutter
in
it
and
beside
it
there
projected
from
the
wall
an
iron
handle
attached
to
a
wheel
and
a
drum
a
line
of
stout
bars
extended
across
the
passage
â€œi
am
about
to
show
you
the
jewel
of
my
collectionâ€
said
he
â€œthere
is
only
one
other
specimen
in
europe
now
that
the
rotterdam
cub
is
dead
it
is
a
brazilian
catâ€
â€œbut
how
does
that
differ
from
any
other
catâ€
â€œyou
will
soon
see
thatâ€
said
he
laughing
â€œwill
you
kindly
draw
that
shutter
and
look
throughâ€
i
did
so
and
found
that
i
was
gazing
into
a
large
empty
room
with
stone
flags
and
small
barred
windows
upon
the
farther
wall
in
the
centre
of
this
room
lying
in
the
middle
of
a
golden
patch
of
sunlight
there
was
stretched
a
huge
creature
as
large
as
a
tiger
but
as
black
and
sleek
as
ebony
it
was
simply
a
very
enormous
and
very
well-kept
black
cat
and
it
cuddled
up
and
basked
in
that
yellow
pool
of
light
exactly
as
a
cat
would
do
it
was
so
graceful
so
sinewy
and
so
gently
and
smoothly
diabolical
that
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
from
the
opening
â€œisnâ€™t
he
splendidâ€
said
my
host
enthusiastically
â€œglorious
i
never
saw
such
a
noble
creatureâ€
â€œsome
people
call
it
a
black
puma
but
really
it
is
not
a
puma
at
all
that
fellow
is
nearly
eleven
feet
from
tail
to
tip
four
years
ago
he
was
a
little
ball
of
black
fluff
with
two
yellow
eyes
staring
out
of
it
he
was
sold
me
as
a
new-born
cub
up
in
the
wild
country
at
the
head-waters
of
the
rio
negro
they
speared
his
mother
to
death
after
she
had
killed
a
dozen
of
themâ€
â€œthey
are
ferocious
thenâ€
â€œthe
most
absolutely
treacherous
and
blood-thirsty
creatures
upon
earth
you
talk
about
a
brazilian
cat
to
an
up-country
indian
and
see
him
get
the
jumps
they
prefer
humans
to
game
this
fellow
has
never
tasted
living
blood
yet
but
when
he
does
he
will
be
a
terror
at
present
he
wonâ€™t
stand
any
one
but
me
in
his
den
even
baldwin
the
groom
dare
not
go
near
him
as
to
me
i
am
his
mother
and
father
in
oneâ€
as
he
spoke
he
suddenly
to
my
astonishment
opened
the
door
and
slipped
in
closing
it
instantly
behind
him
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
huge
lithe
creature
rose
yawned
and
rubbed
its
round
black
head
affectionately
against
his
side
while
he
patted
and
fondled
it
â€œnow
tommy
into
your
cageâ€
said
he
the
monstrous
cat
walked
over
to
one
side
of
the
room
and
coiled
itself
up
under
a
grating
everard
king
came
out
and
taking
the
iron
handle
which
i
have
mentioned
he
began
to
turn
it
as
he
did
so
the
line
of
bars
in
the
corridor
began
to
pass
through
a
slot
in
the
wall
and
closed
up
the
front
of
this
grating
so
as
to
make
an
effective
cage
when
it
was
in
position
he
opened
the
door
once
more
and
invited
me
into
the
room
which
was
heavy
with
the
pungent
musty
smell
peculiar
to
the
great
carnivora
â€œthatâ€™s
how
we
work
itâ€
said
he
â€œwe
give
him
the
run
of
the
room
for
exercise
and
then
at
night
we
put
him
in
his
cage
you
can
let
him
out
by
turning
the
handle
from
the
passage
or
you
can
as
you
have
seen
coop
him
up
in
the
same
way
no
no
you
should
not
do
thatâ€
i
had
put
my
hand
between
the
bars
to
pat
the
glossy
heaving
flank
he
pulled
it
back
with
a
serious
face
â€œi
assure
you
that
he
is
not
safe
donâ€™t
imagine
that
because
i
can
take
liberties
with
him
any
one
else
can
he
is
very
exclusive
in
his
friendsâ€”arenâ€™t
you
tommy
ah
he
hears
his
lunch
coming
to
him
donâ€™t
you
boyâ€
a
step
sounded
in
the
stone-flagged
passage
and
the
creature
had
sprung
to
his
feet
and
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
narrow
cage
his
yellow
eyes
gleaming
and
his
scarlet
tongue
rippling
and
quivering
over
the
white
line
of
his
jagged
teeth
a
groom
entered
with
a
coarse
joint
upon
a
tray
and
thrust
it
through
the
bars
to
him
he
pounced
lightly
upon
it
carried
it
off
to
the
corner
and
there
holding
it
between
his
paws
tore
and
wrenched
at
it
raising
his
bloody
muzzle
every
now
and
then
to
look
at
us
it
was
a
malignant
and
yet
fascinating
sight
â€œyou
canâ€™t
wonder
that
i
am
fond
of
him
can
youâ€
said
my
host
as
we
left
the
room
â€œespecially
when
you
consider
that
i
have
had
the
rearing
of
him
it
was
no
joke
bringing
him
over
from
the
centre
of
south
america
but
here
he
is
safe
and
soundâ€”and
as
i
have
said
far
the
most
perfect
specimen
in
europe
the
people
at
the
zoo
are
dying
to
have
him
but
i
really
canâ€™t
part
with
him
how
i
think
that
i
have
inflicted
my
hobby
upon
you
long
enough
so
we
cannot
do
better
than
follow
tommyâ€™s
example
and
go
to
our
lunchâ€
my
south
american
relative
was
so
engrossed
by
his
grounds
and
their
curious
occupants
that
i
hardly
gave
him
credit
at
first
for
having
any
interests
outside
them
that
he
had
some
and
pressing
ones
was
soon
borne
in
upon
me
by
the
number
of
telegrams
which
he
received
they
arrived
at
all
hours
and
were
always
opened
by
him
with
the
utmost
eagerness
and
anxiety
upon
his
face
sometimes
i
imagined
that
it
must
be
the
turf
and
sometimes
the
stock
exchange
but
certainly
he
had
some
very
urgent
business
going
forwards
which
was
not
transacted
upon
the
downs
of
suffolk
during
the
six
days
of
my
visit
he
had
never
fewer
than
three
or
four
telegrams
a
day
and
sometimes
as
many
as
seven
or
eight
i
had
occupied
these
six
days
so
well
that
by
the
end
of
them
i
had
succeeded
in
getting
upon
the
most
cordial
terms
with
my
cousin
every
night
we
had
sat
up
late
in
the
billiard-room
he
telling
me
the
most
extraordinary
stories
of
his
adventures
in
americaâ€”stories
so
desperate
and
reckless
that
i
could
hardly
associate
them
with
the
brown
little
chubby
man
before
me
in
return
i
ventured
upon
some
of
my
own
reminiscences
of
london
life
which
interested
him
so
much
that
he
vowed
he
would
come
up
to
grosvenor
mansions
and
stay
with
me
he
was
anxious
to
see
the
faster
side
of
city
life
and
certainly
though
i
say
it
he
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
competent
guide
it
was
not
until
the
last
day
of
my
visit
that
i
ventured
to
approach
that
which
was
on
my
mind
i
told
him
frankly
about
my
pecuniary
difficulties
and
my
impending
ruin
and
i
asked
his
adviceâ€”though
i
hoped
for
something
more
solid
he
listened
attentively
puffing
hard
at
his
cigar
â€œbut
surelyâ€
said
he
â€œyou
are
the
heir
of
our
relative
lord
southertonâ€
â€œi
have
every
reason
to
believe
so
but
he
would
never
make
me
any
allowanceâ€
â€œno
no
i
have
heard
of
his
miserly
ways
my
poor
marshall
your
position
has
been
a
very
hard
one
by
the
way
have
you
heard
any
news
of
lord
southertonâ€™s
health
latelyâ€
â€œhe
has
always
been
in
a
critical
condition
ever
since
my
childhoodâ€
â€œexactlyâ€”a
creaking
hinge
if
ever
there
was
one
your
inheritance
may
be
a
long
way
off
dear
me
how
awkwardly
situated
you
areâ€
â€œi
had
some
hopes
sir
that
you
knowing
all
the
facts
might
be
inclined
to
advanceâ€”â€”â€
â€œdonâ€™t
say
another
word
my
dear
boyâ€
he
cried
with
the
utmost
cordiality
â€œwe
shall
talk
it
over
to-night
and
i
give
you
my
word
that
whatever
is
in
my
power
shall
be
doneâ€
i
was
not
sorry
that
my
visit
was
drawing
to
a
close
for
it
is
unpleasant
to
feel
that
there
is
one
person
in
the
house
who
eagerly
desires
your
departure
mrs
kingâ€™s
sallow
face
and
forbidding
eyes
had
become
more
and
more
hateful
to
me
she
was
no
longer
actively
rudeâ€”her
fear
of
her
husband
prevented
herâ€”but
she
pushed
her
insane
jealousy
to
the
extent
of
ignoring
me
never
addressing
me
and
in
every
way
making
my
stay
at
greylands
as
uncomfortable
as
she
could
so
offensive
was
her
manner
during
that
last
day
that
i
should
certainly
have
left
had
it
not
been
for
that
interview
with
my
host
in
the
evening
which
would
i
hoped
retrieve
my
broken
fortunes
it
was
very
late
when
it
occurred
for
my
relative
who
had
been
receiving
even
more
telegrams
than
usual
during
the
day
went
off
to
his
study
after
dinner
and
only
emerged
when
the
household
had
retired
to
bed
i
heard
him
go
round
locking
the
doors
as
his
custom
was
of
a
night
and
finally
he
joined
me
in
the
billiard-room
his
stout
figure
was
wrapped
in
a
dressing-gown
and
he
wore
a
pair
of
red
turkish
slippers
without
any
heels
settling
down
into
an
arm-chair
he
brewed
himself
a
glass
of
grog
in
which
i
could
not
help
noticing
that
the
whisky
considerably
predominated
over
the
water
â€œmy
wordâ€
said
he
â€œwhat
a
nightâ€
it
was
indeed
the
wind
was
howling
and
screaming
round
the
house
and
the
latticed
windows
rattled
and
shook
as
if
they
were
coming
in
the
glow
of
the
yellow
lamps
and
the
flavour
of
our
cigars
seemed
the
brighter
and
more
fragrant
for
the
contrast
â€œnow
my
boyâ€
said
my
host
â€œwe
have
the
house
and
the
night
to
ourselves
let
me
have
an
idea
of
how
your
affairs
stand
and
i
will
see
what
can
be
done
to
set
them
in
order
i
wish
to
hear
every
detailâ€
thus
encouraged
i
entered
into
a
long
exposition
in
which
all
my
tradesmen
and
creditors
from
my
landlord
to
my
valet
figured
in
turn
i
had
notes
in
my
pocket-book
and
i
marshalled
my
facts
and
gave
i
flatter
myself
a
very
business-like
statement
of
my
own
un-business-like
ways
and
lamentable
position
i
was
depressed
however
to
notice
that
my
companionâ€™s
eyes
were
vacant
and
his
attention
elsewhere
when
he
did
occasionally
throw
out
a
remark
it
was
so
entirely
perfunctory
and
pointless
that
i
was
sure
he
had
not
in
the
least
followed
my
remarks
every
now
and
then
he
roused
himself
and
put
on
some
show
of
interest
asking
me
to
repeat
or
to
explain
more
fully
but
it
was
always
to
sink
once
more
into
the
same
brown
study
at
last
he
rose
and
threw
the
end
of
his
cigar
into
the
grate
â€œiâ€™ll
tell
you
what
my
boyâ€
said
he
â€œi
never
had
a
head
for
figures
so
you
will
excuse
me
you
must
jot
it
all
down
upon
paper
and
let
me
have
a
note
of
the
amount
iâ€™ll
understand
it
when
i
see
it
in
black
and
whiteâ€
the
proposal
was
encouraging
i
promised
to
do
so
â€œand
now
itâ€™s
time
we
were
in
bed
by
jove
thereâ€™s
one
oâ€™clock
striking
in
the
hallâ€
the
tinging
of
the
chiming
clock
broke
through
the
deep
roar
of
the
gale
the
wind
was
sweeping
past
with
the
rush
of
a
great
river
â€œi
must
see
my
cat
before
i
go
to
bedâ€
said
my
host
â€œa
high
wind
excites
him
will
you
comeâ€
â€œcertainlyâ€
said
i
â€œthen
tread
softly
and
donâ€™t
speak
for
every
one
is
asleepâ€
we
passed
quietly
down
the
lamp-lit
persian-rugged
hall
and
through
the
door
at
the
farther
end
all
was
dark
in
the
stone
corridor
but
a
stable
lantern
hung
on
a
hook
and
my
host
took
it
down
and
lit
it
there
was
no
grating
visible
in
the
passage
so
i
knew
that
the
beast
was
in
its
cage
â€œcome
inâ€
said
my
relative
and
opened
the
door
a
deep
growling
as
we
entered
showed
that
the
storm
had
really
excited
the
creature
in
the
flickering
light
of
the
lantern
we
saw
it
a
huge
black
mass
coiled
in
the
corner
of
its
den
and
throwing
a
squat
uncouth
shadow
upon
the
whitewashed
wall
its
tail
switched
angrily
among
the
straw
â€œpoor
tommy
is
not
in
the
best
of
tempersâ€
said
everard
king
holding
up
the
lantern
and
looking
in
at
him
â€œwhat
a
black
devil
he
looks
doesnâ€™t
he
i
must
give
him
a
little
supper
to
put
him
in
a
better
humour
would
you
mind
holding
the
lantern
for
a
momentâ€
i
took
it
from
his
hand
and
he
stepped
to
the
door
â€œhis
larder
is
just
outside
hereâ€
said
he
â€œyou
will
excuse
me
for
an
instant
wonâ€™t
youâ€
he
passed
out
and
the
door
shut
with
a
sharp
metallic
click
behind
him
that
hard
crisp
sound
made
my
heart
stand
still
a
sudden
wave
of
terror
passed
over
me
a
vague
perception
of
some
monstrous
treachery
turned
me
cold
i
sprang
to
the
door
but
there
was
no
handle
upon
the
inner
side
â€œhereâ€
i
cried
â€œlet
me
outâ€
â€œall
right
donâ€™t
make
a
rowâ€
said
my
host
from
the
passage
â€œyouâ€™ve
got
the
light
all
rightâ€
â€œyes
but
i
donâ€™t
care
about
being
locked
in
alone
like
thisâ€
â€œdonâ€™t
youâ€
i
heard
his
hearty
chuckling
laugh
â€œyou
wonâ€™t
be
alone
longâ€
â€œlet
me
out
sirâ€
i
repeated
angrily
â€œi
tell
you
i
donâ€™t
allow
practical
jokes
of
this
sortâ€
â€œpractical
is
the
wordâ€
said
he
with
another
hateful
chuckle
and
then
suddenly
i
heard
amidst
the
roar
of
the
storm
the
creak
and
whine
of
the
winch-handle
turning
and
the
rattle
of
the
grating
as
it
passed
through
the
slot
great
god
he
was
letting
loose
the
brazilian
cat
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
i
saw
the
bars
sliding
slowly
before
me
already
there
was
an
opening
a
foot
wide
at
the
farther
end
with
a
scream
i
seized
the
last
bar
with
my
hands
and
pulled
with
the
strength
of
a
madman
i
was
a
madman
with
rage
and
horror
for
a
minute
or
more
i
held
the
thing
motionless
i
knew
that
he
was
straining
with
all
his
force
upon
the
handle
and
that
the
leverage
was
sure
to
overcome
me
i
gave
inch
by
inch
my
feet
sliding
along
the
stones
and
all
the
time
i
begged
and
prayed
this
inhuman
monster
to
save
me
from
this
horrible
death
i
conjured
him
by
his
kinship
i
reminded
him
that
i
was
his
guest
i
begged
to
know
what
harm
i
had
ever
done
him
his
only
answers
were
the
tugs
and
jerks
upon
the
handle
each
of
which
in
spite
of
all
my
struggles
pulled
another
bar
through
the
opening
clinging
and
clutching
i
was
dragged
across
the
whole
front
of
the
cage
until
at
last
with
aching
wrists
and
lacerated
fingers
i
gave
up
the
hopeless
struggle
the
grating
clanged
back
as
i
released
it
and
an
instant
later
i
heard
the
shuffle
of
the
turkish
slippers
in
the
passage
and
the
slam
of
the
distant
door
then
everything
was
silent
the
creature
had
never
moved
during
this
time
he
lay
still
in
the
corner
and
his
tail
had
ceased
switching
this
apparition
of
a
man
adhering
to
his
bars
and
dragged
screaming
across
him
had
apparently
filled
him
with
amazement
i
saw
his
great
eyes
staring
steadily
at
me
i
had
dropped
the
lantern
when
i
seized
the
bars
but
it
still
burned
upon
the
floor
and
i
made
a
movement
to
grasp
it
with
some
idea
that
its
light
might
protect
me
but
the
instant
i
moved
the
beast
gave
a
deep
and
menacing
growl
i
stopped
and
stood
still
quivering
with
fear
in
every
limb
the
cat
if
one
may
call
so
fearful
a
creature
by
so
homely
a
name
was
not
more
than
ten
feet
from
me
the
eyes
glimmered
like
two
discs
of
phosphorus
in
the
darkness
they
appalled
and
yet
fascinated
me
i
could
not
take
my
own
eyes
from
them
nature
plays
strange
tricks
with
us
at
such
moments
of
intensity
and
those
glimmering
lights
waxed
and
waned
with
a
steady
rise
and
fall
sometimes
they
seemed
to
be
tiny
points
of
extreme
brilliancyâ€”little
electric
sparks
in
the
black
obscurityâ€”then
they
would
widen
and
widen
until
all
that
corner
of
the
room
was
filled
with
their
shifting
and
sinister
light
and
then
suddenly
they
went
out
altogether
the
beast
had
closed
its
eyes
i
do
not
know
whether
there
may
be
any
truth
in
the
old
idea
of
the
dominance
of
the
human
gaze
or
whether
the
huge
cat
was
simply
drowsy
but
the
fact
remains
that
far
from
showing
any
symptom
of
attacking
me
it
simply
rested
its
sleek
black
head
upon
its
huge
forepaws
and
seemed
to
sleep
i
stood
fearing
to
move
lest
i
should
rouse
it
into
malignant
life
once
more
but
at
least
i
was
able
to
think
clearly
now
that
the
baleful
eyes
were
off
me
here
i
was
shut
up
for
the
night
with
the
ferocious
beast
my
own
instincts
to
say
nothing
of
the
words
of
the
plausible
villain
who
laid
this
trap
for
me
warned
me
that
the
animal
was
as
savage
as
its
master
how
could
i
stave
it
off
until
morning
the
door
was
hopeless
and
so
were
the
narrow
barred
windows
there
was
no
shelter
anywhere
in
the
bare
stone-flagged
room
to
cry
for
assistance
was
absurd
i
knew
that
this
den
was
an
outhouse
and
that
the
corridor
which
connected
it
with
the
house
was
at
least
a
hundred
feet
long
besides
with
that
gale
thundering
outside
my
cries
were
not
likely
to
be
heard
i
had
only
my
own
courage
and
my
own
wits
to
trust
to
and
then
with
a
fresh
wave
of
horror
my
eyes
fell
upon
the
lantern
the
candle
had
burned
low
and
was
already
beginning
to
gutter
in
ten
minutes
it
would
be
out
i
had
only
ten
minutes
then
in
which
to
do
something
for
i
felt
that
if
i
were
once
left
in
the
dark
with
that
fearful
beast
i
should
be
incapable
of
action
the
very
thought
of
it
paralyzed
me
i
cast
my
despairing
eyes
round
this
chamber
of
death
and
they
rested
upon
one
spot
which
seemed
to
promise
i
will
not
say
safety
but
less
immediate
and
imminent
danger
than
the
open
floor
i
have
said
that
the
cage
had
a
top
as
well
as
a
front
and
this
top
was
left
standing
when
the
front
was
wound
through
the
slot
in
the
wall
it
consisted
of
bars
at
a
few
inchesâ€™
interval
with
stout
wire
netting
between
and
it
rested
upon
a
strong
stanchion
at
each
end
it
stood
now
as
a
great
barred
canopy
over
the
crouching
figure
in
the
corner
the
space
between
this
iron
shelf
and
the
roof
may
have
been
from
two
to
three
feet
if
i
could
only
get
up
there
squeezed
in
between
bars
and
ceiling
i
should
have
only
one
vulnerable
side
i
should
be
safe
from
below
from
behind
and
from
each
side
only
on
the
open
face
of
it
could
i
be
attacked
there
it
is
true
i
had
no
protection
whatever
but
at
least
i
should
be
out
of
the
bruteâ€™s
path
when
he
began
to
pace
about
his
den
he
would
have
to
come
out
of
his
way
to
reach
me
it
was
now
or
never
for
if
once
the
light
were
out
it
would
be
impossible
with
a
gulp
in
my
throat
i
sprang
up
seized
the
iron
edge
of
the
top
and
swung
myself
panting
on
to
it
i
writhed
in
face
downwards
and
found
myself
looking
straight
into
the
terrible
eyes
and
yawning
jaws
of
the
cat
its
fetid
breath
came
up
into
my
face
like
the
steam
from
some
foul
pot
it
appeared
however
to
be
rather
curious
than
angry
with
a
sleek
ripple
of
its
long
black
back
it
rose
stretched
itself
and
then
rearing
itself
on
its
hind
legs
with
one
fore
paw
against
the
wall
it
raised
the
other
and
drew
its
claws
across
the
wire
meshes
beneath
me
one
sharp
white
hook
tore
through
my
trousersâ€”for
i
may
mention
that
i
was
still
in
evening
dressâ€”and
dug
a
furrow
in
my
knee
it
was
not
meant
as
an
attack
but
rather
as
an
experiment
for
upon
my
giving
a
sharp
cry
of
pain
he
dropped
down
again
and
springing
lightly
into
the
room
he
began
walking
swiftly
round
it
looking
up
every
now
and
again
in
my
direction
for
my
part
i
shuffled
backwards
until
i
lay
with
my
back
against
the
wall
screwing
myself
into
the
smallest
space
possible
the
farther
i
got
the
more
difficult
it
was
for
him
to
attack
me
he
seemed
more
excited
now
that
he
had
begun
to
move
about
and
he
ran
swiftly
and
noiselessly
round
and
round
the
den
passing
continually
underneath
the
iron
couch
upon
which
i
lay
it
was
wonderful
to
see
so
great
a
bulk
passing
like
a
shadow
with
hardly
the
softest
thudding
of
velvety
pads
the
candle
was
burning
lowâ€”so
low
that
i
could
hardly
see
the
creature
and
then
with
a
last
flare
and
splutter
it
went
out
altogether
i
was
alone
with
the
cat
in
the
dark
it
helps
one
to
face
a
danger
when
one
knows
that
one
has
done
all
that
possibly
can
be
done
there
is
nothing
for
it
then
but
to
quietly
await
the
result
in
this
case
there
was
no
chance
of
safety
anywhere
except
the
precise
spot
where
i
was
i
stretched
myself
out
therefore
and
lay
silently
almost
breathlessly
hoping
that
the
beast
might
forget
my
presence
if
i
did
nothing
to
remind
him
i
reckoned
that
it
must
already
be
two
oâ€™clock
at
four
it
would
be
full
dawn
i
had
not
more
than
two
hours
to
wait
for
daylight
outside
the
storm
was
still
raging
and
the
rain
lashed
continually
against
the
little
windows
inside
the
poisonous
and
fetid
air
was
overpowering
i
could
neither
hear
nor
see
the
cat
i
tried
to
think
about
other
thingsâ€”but
only
one
had
power
enough
to
draw
my
mind
from
my
terrible
position
that
was
the
contemplation
of
my
cousinâ€™s
villainy
his
unparalleled
hypocrisy
his
malignant
hatred
of
me
beneath
that
cheerful
face
there
lurked
the
spirit
of
a
mediã¦val
assassin
and
as
i
thought
of
it
i
saw
more
clearly
how
cunningly
the
thing
had
been
arranged
he
had
apparently
gone
to
bed
with
the
others
no
doubt
he
had
his
witnesses
to
prove
it
then
unknown
to
them
he
had
slipped
down
had
lured
me
into
this
den
and
abandoned
me
his
story
would
be
so
simple
he
had
left
me
to
finish
my
cigar
in
the
billiard-room
i
had
gone
down
on
my
own
account
to
have
a
last
look
at
the
cat
i
had
entered
the
room
without
observing
that
the
cage
was
opened
and
i
had
been
caught
how
could
such
a
crime
be
brought
home
to
him
suspicion
perhapsâ€”but
proof
never
how
slowly
those
dreadful
two
hours
went
by
once
i
heard
a
low
rasping
sound
which
i
took
to
be
the
creature
licking
its
own
fur
several
times
those
greenish
eyes
gleamed
at
me
through
the
darkness
but
never
in
a
fixed
stare
and
my
hopes
grew
stronger
that
my
presence
had
been
forgotten
or
ignored
at
last
the
least
faint
glimmer
of
light
came
through
the
windowsâ€”i
first
dimly
saw
them
as
two
grey
squares
upon
the
black
wall
then
grey
turned
to
white
and
i
could
see
my
terrible
companion
once
more
and
he
alas
could
see
me
it
was
evident
to
me
at
once
that
he
was
in
a
much
more
dangerous
and
aggressive
mood
than
when
i
had
seen
him
last
the
cold
of
the
morning
had
irritated
him
and
he
was
hungry
as
well
with
a
continual
growl
he
paced
swiftly
up
and
down
the
side
of
the
room
which
was
farthest
from
my
refuge
his
whiskers
bristling
angrily
and
his
tail
switching
and
lashing
as
he
turned
at
the
corners
his
savage
eyes
always
looked
upwards
at
me
with
a
dreadful
menace
i
knew
then
that
he
meant
to
kill
me
yet
i
found
myself
even
at
that
moment
admiring
the
sinuous
grace
of
the
devilish
thing
its
long
undulating
rippling
movements
the
gloss
of
its
beautiful
flanks
the
vivid
palpitating
scarlet
of
the
glistening
tongue
which
hung
from
the
jet-black
muzzle
and
all
the
time
that
deep
threatening
growl
was
rising
and
rising
in
an
unbroken
crescendo
i
knew
that
the
crisis
was
at
hand
it
was
a
miserable
hour
to
meet
such
a
deathâ€”so
cold
so
comfortless
shivering
in
my
light
dress
clothes
upon
this
gridiron
of
torment
upon
which
i
was
stretched
i
tried
to
brace
myself
to
it
to
raise
my
soul
above
it
and
at
the
same
time
with
the
lucidity
which
comes
to
a
perfectly
desperate
man
i
cast
round
for
some
possible
means
of
escape
one
thing
was
clear
to
me
if
that
front
of
the
cage
was
only
back
in
its
position
once
more
i
could
find
a
sure
refuge
behind
it
could
i
possibly
pull
it
back
i
hardly
dared
to
move
for
fear
of
bringing
the
creature
upon
me
slowly
very
slowly
i
put
my
hand
forward
until
it
grasped
the
edge
of
the
front
the
final
bar
which
protruded
through
the
wall
to
my
surprise
it
came
quite
easily
to
my
jerk
of
course
the
difficulty
of
drawing
it
out
arose
from
the
fact
that
i
was
clinging
to
it
i
pulled
again
and
three
inches
of
it
came
through
it
ran
apparently
on
wheels
i
pulled
again

and
then
the
cat
sprang
it
was
so
quick
so
sudden
that
i
never
saw
it
happen
i
simply
heard
the
savage
snarl
and
in
an
instant
afterwards
the
blazing
yellow
eyes
the
flattened
black
head
with
its
red
tongue
and
flashing
teeth
were
within
reach
of
me
the
impact
of
the
creature
shook
the
bars
upon
which
i
lay
until
i
thought
as
far
as
i
could
think
of
anything
at
such
a
moment
that
they
were
coming
down
the
cat
swayed
there
for
an
instant
the
head
and
front
paws
quite
close
to
me
the
hind
paws
clawing
to
find
a
grip
upon
the
edge
of
the
grating
i
heard
the
claws
rasping
as
they
clung
to
the
wire
netting
and
the
breath
of
the
beast
made
me
sick
but
its
bound
had
been
miscalculated
it
could
not
retain
its
position
slowly
grinning
with
rage
and
scratching
madly
at
the
bars
it
swung
backwards
and
dropped
heavily
upon
the
floor
with
a
growl
it
instantly
faced
round
to
me
and
crouched
for
another
spring
i
knew
that
the
next
few
moments
would
decide
my
fate
the
creature
had
learned
by
experience
it
would
not
miscalculate
again
i
must
act
promptly
fearlessly
if
i
were
to
have
a
chance
for
life
in
an
instant
i
had
formed
my
plan
pulling
off
my
dress-coat
i
threw
it
down
over
the
head
of
the
beast
at
the
same
moment
i
dropped
over
the
edge
seized
the
end
of
the
front
grating
and
pulled
it
frantically
out
of
the
wall
it
came
more
easily
than
i
could
have
expected
i
rushed
across
the
room
bearing
it
with
me
but
as
i
rushed
the
accident
of
my
position
put
me
upon
the
outer
side
had
it
been
the
other
way
i
might
have
come
off
scathless
as
it
was
there
was
a
momentâ€™s
pause
as
i
stopped
it
and
tried
to
pass
in
through
the
opening
which
i
had
left
that
moment
was
enough
to
give
time
to
the
creature
to
toss
off
the
coat
with
which
i
had
blinded
him
and
to
spring
upon
me
i
hurled
myself
through
the
gap
and
pulled
the
rails
to
behind
me
but
he
seized
my
leg
before
i
could
entirely
withdraw
it
one
stroke
of
that
huge
paw
tore
off
my
calf
as
a
shaving
of
wood
curls
off
before
a
plane
the
next
moment
bleeding
and
fainting
i
was
lying
among
the
foul
straw
with
a
line
of
friendly
bars
between
me
and
the
creature
which
ramped
so
frantically
against
them
too
wounded
to
move
and
too
faint
to
be
conscious
of
fear
i
could
only
lie
more
dead
than
alive
and
watch
it
it
pressed
its
broad
black
chest
against
the
bars
and
angled
for
me
with
its
crooked
paws
as
i
have
seen
a
kitten
do
before
a
mouse-trap
it
ripped
my
clothes
but
stretch
as
it
would
it
could
not
quite
reach
me
i
have
heard
of
the
curious
numbing
effect
produced
by
wounds
from
the
great
carnivora
and
now
i
was
destined
to
experience
it
for
i
had
lost
all
sense
of
personality
and
was
as
interested
in
the
catâ€™s
failure
or
success
as
if
it
were
some
game
which
i
was
watching
and
then
gradually
my
mind
drifted
away
into
strange
vague
dreams
always
with
that
black
face
and
red
tongue
coming
back
into
them
and
so
i
lost
myself
in
the
nirvana
of
delirium
the
blessed
relief
of
those
who
are
too
sorely
tried
tracing
the
course
of
events
afterwards
i
conclude
that
i
must
have
been
insensible
for
about
two
hours
what
roused
me
to
consciousness
once
more
was
that
sharp
metallic
click
which
had
been
the
precursor
of
my
terrible
experience
it
was
the
shooting
back
of
the
spring
lock
then
before
my
senses
were
clear
enough
to
entirely
apprehend
what
they
saw
i
was
aware
of
the
round
benevolent
face
of
my
cousin
peering
in
through
the
opened
door
what
he
saw
evidently
amazed
him
there
was
the
cat
crouching
on
the
floor
i
was
stretched
upon
my
back
in
my
shirtsleeves
within
the
cage
my
trousers
torn
to
ribbons
and
a
great
pool
of
blood
all
round
me
i
can
see
his
amazed
face
now
with
the
morning
sunlight
upon
it
he
peered
at
me
and
peered
again
then
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
advanced
to
the
cage
to
see
if
i
were
really
dead
i
cannot
undertake
to
say
what
happened
i
was
not
in
a
fit
state
to
witness
or
to
chronicle
such
events
i
can
only
say
that
i
was
suddenly
conscious
that
his
face
was
away
from
meâ€”that
he
was
looking
towards
the
animal
â€œgood
old
tommyâ€
he
cried
â€œgood
old
tommyâ€
then
he
came
near
the
bars
with
his
back
still
towards
me
â€œdown
you
stupid
beastâ€
he
roared
â€œdown
sir
donâ€™t
you
know
your
masterâ€
suddenly
even
in
my
bemuddled
brain
a
remembrance
came
of
those
words
of
his
when
he
had
said
that
the
taste
of
blood
would
turn
the
cat
into
a
fiend
my
blood
had
done
it
but
he
was
to
pay
the
price
â€œget
awayâ€
he
screamed
â€œget
away
you
devil
baldwin
baldwin
oh
my
godâ€
and
then
i
heard
him
fall
and
rise
and
fall
again
with
a
sound
like
the
ripping
of
sacking
his
screams
grew
fainter
until
they
were
lost
in
the
worrying
snarl
and
then
after
i
thought
that
he
was
dead
i
saw
as
in
a
nightmare
a
blinded
tattered
blood-soaked
figure
running
wildly
round
the
roomâ€”and
that
was
the
last
glimpse
which
i
had
of
him
before
i
fainted
once
again





i
was
many
months
in
my
recoveryâ€”in
fact
i
cannot
say
that
i
have
ever
recovered
for
to
the
end
of
my
days
i
shall
carry
a
stick
as
a
sign
of
my
night
with
the
brazilian
cat
baldwin
the
groom
and
the
other
servants
could
not
tell
what
had
occurred
when
drawn
by
the
death
cries
of
their
master
they
found
me
behind
the
bars
and
his
remainsâ€”or
what
they
afterwards
discovered
to
be
his
remainsâ€”in
the
clutch
of
the
creature
which
he
had
reared
they
stalled
him
off
with
hot
irons
and
afterwards
shot
him
through
the
loophole
of
the
door
before
they
could
finally
extricate
me
i
was
carried
to
my
bedroom
and
there
under
the
roof
of
my
would-be
murderer
i
remained
between
life
and
death
for
several
weeks
they
had
sent
for
a
surgeon
from
clipton
and
a
nurse
from
london
and
in
a
month
i
was
able
to
be
carried
to
the
station
and
so
conveyed
back
once
more
to
grosvenor
mansions
i
have
one
remembrance
of
that
illness
which
might
have
been
part
of
the
ever-changing
panorama
conjured
up
by
a
delirious
brain
were
it
not
so
definitely
fixed
in
my
memory
one
night
when
the
nurse
was
absent
the
door
of
my
chamber
opened
and
a
tall
woman
in
blackest
mourning
slipped
into
the
room
she
came
across
to
me
and
as
she
bent
her
sallow
face
i
saw
by
the
faint
gleam
of
the
night-light
that
it
was
the
brazilian
woman
whom
my
cousin
had
married
she
stared
intently
into
my
face
and
her
expression
was
more
kindly
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
â€œare
you
consciousâ€
she
asked
i
feebly
noddedâ€”for
i
was
still
very
weak
â€œwell
then
i
only
wished
to
say
to
you
that
you
have
yourself
to
blame
did
i
not
do
all
i
could
for
you
from
the
beginning
i
tried
to
drive
you
from
the
house
by
every
means
short
of
betraying
my
husband
i
tried
to
save
you
from
him
i
knew
that
he
had
a
reason
for
bringing
you
here
i
knew
that
he
would
never
let
you
get
away
again
no
one
knew
him
as
i
knew
him
who
had
suffered
from
him
so
often
i
did
not
dare
to
tell
you
all
this
he
would
have
killed
me
but
i
did
my
best
for
you
as
things
have
turned
out
you
have
been
the
best
friend
that
i
have
ever
had
you
have
set
me
free
and
i
fancied
that
nothing
but
death
would
do
that
i
am
sorry
if
you
are
hurt
but
i
cannot
reproach
myself
i
told
you
that
you
were
a
foolâ€”and
a
fool
you
have
beenâ€
she
crept
out
of
the
room
the
bitter
singular
woman
and
i
was
never
destined
to
see
her
again
with
what
remained
from
her
husbandâ€™s
property
she
went
back
to
her
native
land
and
i
have
heard
that
she
afterwards
took
the
veil
at
pernambuco
it
was
not
until
i
had
been
back
in
london
for
some
time
that
the
doctors
pronounced
me
to
be
well
enough
to
do
business
it
was
not
a
very
welcome
permission
to
me
for
i
feared
that
it
would
be
the
signal
for
an
inrush
of
creditors
but
it
was
summers
my
lawyer
who
first
took
advantage
of
it
â€œi
am
very
glad
to
see
that
your
lordship
is
so
much
betterâ€
said
he
â€œi
have
been
waiting
a
long
time
to
offer
my
congratulationsâ€
â€œwhat
do
you
mean
summers
this
is
no
time
for
jokingâ€
â€œi
mean
what
i
sayâ€
he
answered
â€œyou
have
been
lord
southerton
for
the
last
six
weeks
but
we
feared
that
it
would
retard
your
recovery
if
you
were
to
learn
itâ€
lord
southerton
one
of
the
richest
peers
in
england
i
could
not
believe
my
ears
and
then
suddenly
i
thought
of
the
time
which
had
elapsed
and
how
it
coincided
with
my
injuries
â€œthen
lord
southerton
must
have
died
about
the
same
time
that
i
was
hurtâ€
â€œhis
death
occurred
upon
that
very
dayâ€
summers
looked
hard
at
me
as
i
spoke
and
i
am
convincedâ€”for
he
was
a
very
shrewd
fellowâ€”that
he
had
guessed
the
true
state
of
the
case
he
paused
for
a
moment
as
if
awaiting
a
confidence
from
me
but
i
could
not
see
what
was
to
be
gained
by
exposing
such
a
family
scandal
â€œyes
a
very
curious
coincidenceâ€
he
continued
with
the
same
knowing
look
â€œof
course
you
are
aware
that
your
cousin
everard
king
was
the
next
heir
to
the
estates
now
if
it
had
been
you
instead
of
him
who
had
been
torn
to
pieces
by
this
tiger
or
whatever
it
was
then
of
course
he
would
have
been
lord
southerton
at
the
present
momentâ€
â€œno
doubtâ€
said
i
â€œand
he
took
such
an
interest
in
itâ€
said
summers
â€œi
happen
to
know
that
the
late
lord
southertonâ€™s
valet
was
in
his
pay
and
that
he
used
to
have
telegrams
from
him
every
few
hours
to
tell
him
how
he
was
getting
on
that
would
be
about
the
time
when
you
were
down
there
was
it
not
strange
that
he
should
wish
to
be
so
well
informed
since
he
knew
that
he
was
not
the
direct
heirâ€
â€œvery
strangeâ€
said
i
â€œand
now
summers
if
you
will
bring
me
my
bills
and
a
new
cheque-book
we
will
begin
to
get
things
into
orderâ€

incisive

â€œathleteâ€
â€œnothing

â€œnot

â€œoh
noâ€
mr
lumsden
shook
his
head
despondently
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
a
way
which
sent
my
hopes
down
to
zero
â€œthere
is
a
very
keen
competition
for
masterships
mr
weldâ€
said
he
â€œthe
vacancies
are
few
and
the
applicants
innumerable
a
first-class
athlete
oar
or
cricketer
or
a
man
who
has
passed
very
high
in
his
examinations
can
usually
find
a
vacancyâ€”i
might
say
always
in
the
case
of
the
cricketer
but
the
average
manâ€”if
you
will
excuse
the
description
mr
weldâ€”has
a
very
great
difficulty
almost
an
insurmountable
difficulty
we
have
already
more
than
a
hundred
such
names
upon
our
lists
and
if
you
think
it
worth
while
our
adding
yours
i
daresay
that
in
the
course
of
some
years
we
may
possibly
be
able
to
find
you
some
opening
whichâ€”â€”â€
he
paused
on
account
of
a
knock
at
the
door
it
was
a
clerk
with
a
note
mr
lumsden
broke
the
seal
and
read
it
â€œwhy
mr
weldâ€
said
he
â€œthis
is
really
rather
an
interesting
coincidence
i
understand
you
to
say
that
latin
and
english
are
your
subjects
and
that
you
would
prefer
for
a
time
to
accept
a
place
in
an
elementary
establishment
where
you
would
have
time
for
private
studyâ€
â€œquite
soâ€
â€œthis
note
contains
a
request
from
an
old
client
of
ours
dr
phelps
mccarthy
of
willow
lea
house
academy
west
hampstead
that
i
should
at
once
send
him
a
young
man
who
should
be
qualified
to
teach
latin
and
english
to
a
small
class
of
boys
under
fourteen
years
of
age
his
vacancy
appears
to
be
the
very
one
which
you
are
looking
for
the
terms
are
not
munificentâ€”sixty
pounds
board
lodging
and
washingâ€”but
the
work
is
not
onerous
and
you
would
have
the
evenings
to
yourselfâ€
â€œthat
would
doâ€
i
cried
with
all
the
eagerness
of
the
man
who
sees
work
at
last
after
weary
months
of
seeking
â€œi
donâ€™t
know
that
it
is
quite
fair
to
these
gentlemen
whose
names
have
been
so
long
upon
our
listâ€
said
mr
lumsden
glancing
down
at
his
open
ledger
â€œbut
the
coincidence
is
so
striking
that
i
feel
we
must
really
give
you
the
refusal
of
itâ€
â€œthen
i
accept
it
sir
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
youâ€
â€œthere
is
one
small
provision
in
dr
mccarthyâ€™s
letter
he
stipulates
that
the
applicant
must
be
a
man
with
an
imperturbably
good
temperâ€
â€œi
am
the
very
manâ€
said
i
with
conviction
â€œwellâ€
said
mr
lumsden
with
some
hesitation
â€œi
hope
that
your
temper
is
really
as
good
as
you
say
for
i
rather
fancy
that
you
may
need
itâ€
â€œi
presume
that
every
elementary
schoolmaster
doesâ€
â€œyes
sir
but
it
is
only
fair
to
you
to
warn
you
that
there
may
be
some
especially
trying
circumstances
in
this
particular
situation
dr
phelps
mccarthy
does
not
make
such
a
condition
without
some
very
good
and
pressing
reasonâ€
there
was
a
certain
solemnity
in
his
speech
which
struck
a
chill
in
the
delight
with
which
i
had
welcomed
this
providential
vacancy
â€œmay
i
ask
the
nature
of
these
circumstancesâ€
i
asked
â€œwe
endeavour
to
hold
the
balance
equally
between
our
clients
and
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
all
of
them
if
i
knew
of
objections
to
you
i
should
certainly
communicate
them
to
dr
mccarthy
and
so
i
have
no
hesitation
in
doing
as
much
for
you
i
findâ€
he
continued
glancing
over
the
pages
of
his
ledger
â€œthat
within
the
last
twelve
months
we
have
supplied
no
fewer
than
seven
latin
masters
to
willow
lea
house
academy
four
of
them
having
left
so
abruptly
as
to
forfeit
their
monthâ€™s
salary
and
none
of
them
having
stayed
more
than
eight
weeksâ€
â€œand
the
other
masters
have
they
stayedâ€
â€œthere
is
only
one
other
residential
master
and
he
appears
to
be
unchanged
you
can
understand
mr
weldâ€
continued
the
agent
closing
both
the
ledger
and
the
interview
â€œthat
such
rapid
changes
are
not
desirable
from
a
masterâ€™s
point
of
view
whatever
may
be
said
for
them
by
an
agent
working
on
commission
i
have
no
idea
why
these
gentlemen
have
resigned
their
situations
so
early
i
can
only
give
you
the
facts
and
advise
you
to
see
dr
mccarthy
at
once
and
to
form
your
own
conclusionsâ€
great
is
the
power
of
the
man
who
has
nothing
to
lose
and
it
was
therefore
with
perfect
serenity
but
with
a
good
deal
of
curiosity
that
i
rang
early
that
afternoon
the
heavy
wrought-iron
bell
of
the
willow
lea
house
academy
the
building
was
a
massive
pile
square
and
ugly
standing
in
its
own
extensive
grounds
with
a
broad
carriage-sweep
curving
up
to
it
from
the
road
it
stood
high
and
commanded
a
view
on
the
one
side
of
the
grey
roofs
and
bristling
spires
of
northern
london
and
on
the
other
of
the
well-wooded
and
beautiful
country
which
fringes
the
great
city
the
door
was
opened
by
a
boy
in
buttons
and
i
was
shown
into
a
well-appointed
study
where
the
principal
of
the
academy
presently
joined
me
the
warnings
and
insinuations
of
the
agent
had
prepared
me
to
meet
a
choleric
and
overbearing
personâ€”one
whose
manner
was
an
insupportable
provocation
to
those
who
worked
under
him
anything
further
from
the
reality
cannot
be
imagined
he
was
a
frail
gentle
creature
clean-shaven
and
round-shouldered
with
a
bearing
which
was
so
courteous
that
it
became
almost
deprecating
his
bushy
hair
was
thickly
shot
with
grey
and
his
age
i
should
imagine
to
verge
upon
sixty
his
voice
was
low
and
suave
and
he
walked
with
a
certain
mincing
delicacy
of
manner
his
whole
appearance
was
that
of
a
kindly
scholar
who
was
more
at
home
among
his
books
than
in
the
practical
affairs
of
the
world
â€œi
am
sure
that
we
shall
be
very
happy
to
have
your
assistance
mr
weldâ€
said
he
after
a
few
professional
questions
â€œmr
percival
manners
left
me
yesterday
and
i
should
be
glad
if
you
could
take
over
his
duties
to-morrowâ€
â€œmay
i
ask
if
that
is
mr
percival
manners
of
selwynâ€
i
asked
â€œprecisely
did
you
know
himâ€
â€œyes
he
is
a
friend
of
mineâ€
â€œan
excellent
teacher
but
a
little
hasty
in
his
disposition
it
was
his
only
fault
now
in
your
case
mr
weld
is
your
own
temper
under
good
control
supposing
for
argumentâ€™s
sake
that
i
were
to
so
far
forget
myself
as
to
be
rude
to
you
or
to
speak
roughly
or
to
jar
your
feelings
in
any
way
could
you
rely
upon
yourself
to
control
your
emotionsâ€
i
smiled
at
the
idea
of
this
courteous
little
mincing
creature
ruffling
my
nerves
â€œi
think
that
i
could
answer
for
it
sirâ€
said
i
â€œquarrels
are
very
painful
to
meâ€
said
he
â€œi
wish
every
one
to
live
in
harmony
under
my
roof
i
will
not
deny
mr
percival
manners
had
provocation
but
i
wish
to
find
a
man
who
can
raise
himself
above
provocation
and
sacrifice
his
own
feelings
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
concordâ€
â€œi
will
do
my
best
sirâ€
â€œyou
cannot
say
more
mr
weld
in
that
case
i
shall
expect
you
to-night
if
you
can
get
your
things
ready
so
soonâ€
i
not
only
succeeded
in
getting
my
things
ready
but
i
found
time
to
call
at
the
benedict
club
in
piccadilly
where
i
knew
that
i
should
find
manners
if
he
were
still
in
town
there
he
was
sure
enough
in
the
smoking-room
and
i
questioned
him
over
a
cigarette
as
to
his
reasons
for
throwing
up
his
recent
situation
â€œyou
donâ€™t
tell
me
that
you
are
going
to
dr
phelps
mccarthyâ€™s
academyâ€
he
cried
staring
at
me
in
surprise
â€œmy
dear
chap
itâ€™s
no
use
you
canâ€™t
possibly
remain
thereâ€
â€œbut
i
saw
him
and
he
seemed
the
most
courtly
inoffensive
fellow
i
never
met
a
man
with
more
gentle
mannersâ€
â€œhe
oh
heâ€™s
all
right
thereâ€™s
no
vice
in
him
have
you
seen
theophilus
st
jamesâ€
â€œi
have
never
heard
the
name
who
is
heâ€
â€œyour
colleague
the
other
masterâ€
â€œno
i
have
not
seen
himâ€
â€œheâ€™s
the
terror
if
you
can
stand
him
you
have
either
the
spirit
of
a
perfect
christian
or
else
you
have
no
spirit
at
all
a
more
perfect
bounder
never
boundedâ€
â€œbut
why
does
mccarthy
stand
itâ€
my
friend
looked
at
me
significantly
through
his
cigarette
smoke
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
â€œyou
will
form
your
own
conclusions
about
that
mine
were
formed
very
soon
and
i
never
found
occasion
to
alter
themâ€
â€œit
would
help
me
very
much
if
you
would
tell
me
themâ€
â€œwhen
you
see
a
man
in
his
own
house
allowing
his
business
to
be
ruined
his
comfort
destroyed
and
his
authority
defied
by
another
man
in
a
subordinate
position
and
calmly
submitting
to
it
without
so
much
as
a
word
of
protest
what
conclusion
do
you
come
toâ€
â€œthat
the
one
has
a
hold
over
the
otherâ€
percival
manners
nodded
his
head
â€œthere
you
are
youâ€™ve
hit
it
first
barrel
it
seems
to
me
that
thereâ€™s
no
other
explanation
which
will
cover
the
facts
at
some
period
in
his
life
the
little
doctor
has
gone
astray
humanum
est
errare
i
have
even
done
it
myself
but
this
was
something
serious
and
the
other
man
got
a
hold
of
it
and
has
never
let
go
thatâ€™s
the
truth
blackmail
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
but
he
had
no
hold
over
me
and
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
stand
his
insolence
so
i
came
awayâ€”and
i
very
much
expect
to
see
you
do
the
sameâ€
for
some
time
he
talked
over
the
matter
but
he
always
came
to
the
same
conclusionâ€”that
i
should
not
retain
my
new
situation
very
long
it
was
with
no
very
pleasant
feelings
after
this
preparation
that
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
the
very
man
of
whom
i
had
received
so
evil
an
account
dr
mccarthy
introduced
us
to
each
other
in
his
study
on
the
evening
of
that
same
day
immediately
after
my
arrival
at
the
school
â€œthis
is
your
new
colleague
mr
st
jamesâ€
said
he
in
his
genial
courteous
fashion
â€œi
trust
that
you
will
mutually
agree
and
that
i
shall
find
nothing
but
good
feeling
and
sympathy
beneath
this
roofâ€
i
shared
the
good
doctorâ€™s
hope
but
my
expectations
of
it
were
not
increased
by
the
appearance
of
my
confrã¨re
he
was
a
young
bull-necked
fellow
about
thirty
years
of
age
dark-eyed
and
black-haired
with
an
exceedingly
vigorous
physique
i
have
never
seen
a
more
strongly
built
man
though
he
tended
to
run
to
fat
in
a
way
which
showed
that
he
was
in
the
worst
of
training
his
face
was
coarse
swollen
and
brutal
with
a
pair
of
small
black
eyes
deeply
sunken
in
his
head
his
heavy
jowl
his
projecting
ears
and
his
thick
bandy
legs
all
went
to
make
up
a
personality
which
was
as
formidable
as
it
was
repellent
â€œi
hear
youâ€™ve
never
been
out
beforeâ€
said
he
in
a
rude
brusque
fashion
â€œwell
itâ€™s
a
poor
life
hard
work
and
starvation
pay
as
youâ€™ll
find
out
for
yourselfâ€
â€œbut
it
has
some
compensationsâ€
said
the
principal
â€œsurely
you
will
allow
that
mr
st
jamesâ€
â€œhas
it
i
never
could
find
them
what
do
you
call
compensationsâ€
â€œeven
to
be
in
the
continual
presence
of
youth
is
a
privilege
it
has
the
effect
of
keeping
youth
in
oneâ€™s
own
soul
for
one
reflects
something
of
their
high
spirits
and
their
keen
enjoyment
of
lifeâ€
â€œlittle
beastsâ€
cried
my
colleague
â€œcome
come
mr
st
james
you
are
too
hard
upon
themâ€
â€œi
hate
the
sight
of
them
if
i
could
put
them
and
their
blessed
copybooks
and
lexicons
and
slates
into
one
bonfire
iâ€™d
do
it
to-nightâ€
â€œthis
is
mr
st
jamesâ€™s
way
of
talkingâ€
said
the
principal
smiling
nervously
as
he
glanced
at
me
â€œyou
must
not
take
him
too
seriously
now
mr
weld
you
know
where
your
room
is
and
no
doubt
you
have
your
own
little
arrangements
to
make
the
sooner
you
make
them
the
sooner
you
will
feel
yourself
at
homeâ€
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
only
too
anxious
to
remove
me
at
once
from
the
influence
of
this
extraordinary
colleague
and
i
was
glad
to
go
for
the
conversation
had
become
embarrassing
and
so
began
an
epoch
which
always
seems
to
me
as
i
look
back
to
it
to
be
the
most
singular
in
all
my
experience
the
school
was
in
many
ways
an
excellent
one
dr
phelps
mccarthy
was
an
ideal
principal
his
methods
were
modern
and
rational
the
management
was
all
that
could
be
desired
and
yet
in
the
middle
of
this
well-ordered
machine
there
intruded
the
incongruous
and
impossible
mr
st
james
throwing
everything
into
confusion
his
duties
were
to
teach
english
and
mathematics
and
how
he
acquitted
himself
of
them
i
do
not
know
as
our
classes
were
held
in
separate
rooms
i
can
answer
for
it
however
that
the
boys
feared
him
and
loathed
him
and
i
know
that
they
had
good
reason
to
do
so
for
frequently
my
own
teaching
was
interrupted
by
his
bellowings
of
anger
and
even
by
the
sound
of
his
blows
dr
mccarthy
spent
most
of
his
time
in
his
class
but
it
was
i
suspect
to
watch
over
the
master
rather
than
the
boys
and
to
try
to
moderate
his
ferocious
temper
when
it
threatened
to
become
dangerous
it
was
in
his
bearing
to
the
head
master
however
that
my
colleagueâ€™s
conduct
was
most
outrageous
the
first
conversation
which
i
have
recorded
proved
to
be
typical
of
their
intercourse
he
domineered
over
him
openly
and
brutally
i
have
heard
him
contradict
him
roughly
before
the
whole
school
at
no
time
would
he
show
him
any
mark
of
respect
and
my
temper
often
rose
within
me
when
i
saw
the
quiet
acquiescence
of
the
old
doctor
and
his
patient
tolerance
of
this
monstrous
treatment
and
yet
the
sight
of
it
surrounded
the
principal
also
with
a
certain
vague
horror
in
my
mind
for
supposing
my
friendâ€™s
theory
to
be
correctâ€”and
i
could
devise
no
better
oneâ€”how
black
must
have
been
the
story
which
could
be
held
over
his
head
by
this
man
and
by
fear
of
its
publicity
force
him
to
undergo
such
humiliations
this
quiet
gentle
doctor
might
be
a
profound
hypocrite
a
criminal
a
forger
possibly
or
a
poisoner
only
such
a
secret
as
this
could
account
for
the
complete
power
which
the
young
man
held
over
him
why
else
should
he
admit
so
hateful
a
presence
into
his
house
and
so
harmful
an
influence
into
his
school
why
should
he
submit
to
degradations
which
could
not
be
witnessed
far
less
endured
without
indignation
and
yet
if
it
were
so
i
was
forced
to
confess
that
my
principal
carried
it
off
with
extraordinary
duplicity
never
by
word
or
sign
did
he
show
that
the
young
manâ€™s
presence
was
distasteful
to
him
i
have
seen
him
look
pained
it
is
true
after
some
peculiarly
outrageous
exhibition
but
he
gave
me
the
impression
that
it
was
always
on
account
of
the
scholars
or
of
me
never
on
account
of
himself
he
spoke
to
and
of
st
james
in
an
indulgent
fashion
smiling
gently
at
what
made
my
blood
boil
within
me
in
his
way
of
looking
at
him
and
addressing
him
one
could
see
no
trace
of
resentment
but
rather
a
sort
of
timid
and
deprecating
good
will
his
company
he
certainly
courted
and
they
spent
many
hours
together
in
the
study
and
the
garden
as
to
my
own
relations
with
theophilus
st
james
i
made
up
my
mind
from
the
beginning
that
i
should
keep
my
temper
with
him
and
to
that
resolution
i
steadfastly
adhered
if
dr
mccarthy
chose
to
permit
this
disrespect
and
to
condone
these
outrages
it
was
his
affair
and
not
mine
it
was
evident
that
his
one
wish
was
that
there
should
be
peace
between
us
and
i
felt
that
i
could
help
him
best
by
respecting
this
desire
my
easiest
way
to
do
so
was
to
avoid
my
colleague
and
this
i
did
to
the
best
of
my
ability
when
we
were
thrown
together
i
was
quiet
polite
and
reserved
he
on
his
part
showed
me
no
ill-will
but
met
me
rather
with
a
coarse
joviality
and
a
rough
familiarity
which
he
meant
to
be
ingratiating
he
was
insistent
in
his
attempts
to
get
me
into
his
room
at
night
for
the
purpose
of
playing
euchre
and
of
drinking
â€œold
mccarthy
doesnâ€™t
mindâ€
said
he
â€œdonâ€™t
you
be
afraid
of
him
weâ€™ll
do
what
we
like
and
iâ€™ll
answer
for
it
that
he
wonâ€™t
objectâ€
once
only
i
went
and
when
i
left
after
a
dull
and
gross
evening
my
host
was
stretched
dead
drunk
upon
the
sofa
after
that
i
gave
the
excuse
of
a
course
of
study
and
spent
my
spare
hours
alone
in
my
own
room
one
point
upon
which
i
was
anxious
to
gain
information
was
as
to
how
long
these
proceedings
had
been
going
on
when
did
st
james
assert
his
hold
over
dr
mccarthy
from
neither
of
them
could
i
learn
how
long
my
colleague
had
been
in
his
present
situation
one
or
two
leading
questions
upon
my
part
were
eluded
or
ignored
in
a
manner
so
marked
that
it
was
easy
to
see
that
they
were
both
of
them
as
eager
to
conceal
the
point
as
i
was
to
know
it
but
at
last
one
evening
i
had
the
chance
of
a
chat
with
mrs
carter
the
matronâ€”for
the
doctor
was
a
widowerâ€”and
from
her
i
got
the
information
which
i
wanted
it
needed
no
questioning
to
get
at
her
knowledge
for
she
was
so
full
of
indignation
that
she
shook
with
passion
as
she
spoke
of
it
and
raised
her
hands
into
the
air
in
the
earnestness
of
her
denunciation
as
she
described
the
grievances
which
she
had
against
my
colleague
â€œit
was
three
years
ago
mr
weld
that
he
first
darkened
this
doorstepâ€
she
cried
â€œthree
bitter
years
they
have
been
to
me
the
school
had
fifty
boys
then
now
it
has
twenty-two
thatâ€™s
what
he
has
done
for
us
in
three
years
in
another
three
there
wonâ€™t
be
one
and
the
doctor
that
angel
of
patience
you
see
how
he
treats
him
though
he
is
not
fit
to
lace
his
boots
for
him
if
it
wasnâ€™t
for
the
doctor
you
may
be
sure
that
i
wouldnâ€™t
stay
an
hour
under
the
same
roof
with
such
a
man
and
so
i
told
him
to
his
own
face
mr
weld
if
the
doctor
would
only
pack
him
about
his
businessâ€”but
i
know
that
i
am
saying
more
than
i
shouldâ€
she
stopped
herself
with
an
effort
and
spoke
no
more
upon
the
subject
she
had
remembered
that
i
was
almost
a
stranger
in
the
school
and
she
feared
that
she
had
been
indiscreet
there
were
one
or
two
very
singular
points
about
my
colleague
the
chief
one
was
that
he
rarely
took
any
exercise
there
was
a
playing-field
within
the
college
grounds
and
that
was
his
farthest
point
if
the
boys
went
out
it
was
i
or
dr
mccarthy
who
accompanied
them
st
james
gave
as
a
reason
for
this
that
he
had
injured
his
knee
some
years
before
and
that
walking
was
painful
to
him
for
my
own
part
i
put
it
down
to
pure
laziness
upon
his
part
for
he
was
of
an
obese
heavy
temperament
twice
however
i
saw
him
from
my
window
stealing
out
of
the
grounds
late
at
night
and
the
second
time
i
watched
him
return
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
and
slink
in
through
an
open
window
these
furtive
excursions
were
never
alluded
to
but
they
exposed
the
hollowness
of
his
story
about
his
knee
and
they
increased
the
dislike
and
distrust
which
i
had
of
the
man
his
nature
seemed
to
be
vicious
to
the
core
another
point
small
but
suggestive
was
that
he
hardly
ever
during
the
months
that
i
was
at
willow
lea
house
received
any
letters
and
on
those
few
occasions
they
were
obviously
tradesmenâ€™s
bills
i
am
an
early
riser
and
used
every
morning
to
pick
my
own
correspondence
out
of
the
bundle
upon
the
hall
table
i
could
judge
therefore
how
few
were
ever
there
for
mr
theophilus
st
james
there
seemed
to
me
to
be
something
peculiarly
ominous
in
this
what
sort
of
a
man
could
he
be
who
during
thirty
years
of
life
had
never
made
a
single
friend
high
or
low
who
cared
to
continue
to
keep
in
touch
with
him
and
yet
the
sinister
fact
remained
that
the
head
master
not
only
tolerated
but
was
even
intimate
with
him
more
than
once
on
entering
a
room
i
have
found
them
talking
confidentially
together
and
they
would
walk
arm
in
arm
in
deep
conversation
up
and
down
the
garden
paths
so
curious
did
i
become
to
know
what
the
tie
was
which
bound
them
that
i
found
it
gradually
push
out
my
other
interests
and
become
the
main
purpose
of
my
life
in
school
and
out
of
school
at
meals
and
at
play
i
was
perpetually
engaged
in
watching
dr
phelps
mccarthy
and
mr
theophilus
st
james
and
in
endeavouring
to
solve
the
mystery
which
surrounded
them
but
unfortunately
my
curiosity
was
a
little
too
open
i
had
not
the
art
to
conceal
the
suspicions
which
i
felt
about
the
relations
which
existed
between
these
two
men
and
the
nature
of
the
hold
which
the
one
appeared
to
have
over
the
other
it
may
have
been
my
manner
of
watching
them
it
may
have
been
some
indiscreet
question
but
it
is
certain
that
i
showed
too
clearly
what
i
felt
one
night
i
was
conscious
that
the
eyes
of
theophilus
st
james
were
fixed
upon
me
in
a
surly
and
menacing
stare
i
had
a
foreboding
of
evil
and
i
was
not
surprised
when
dr
mccarthy
called
me
next
morning
into
his
study
â€œi
am
very
sorry
mr
weldâ€
said
he
â€œbut
i
am
afraid
that
i
shall
be
compelled
to
dispense
with
your
servicesâ€
â€œperhaps
you
would
give
me
some
reason
for
dismissing
meâ€
i
answered
for
i
was
conscious
of
having
done
my
duties
to
the
best
of
my
power
and
knew
well
that
only
one
reason
could
be
given
â€œi
have
no
fault
to
find
with
youâ€
said
he
and
the
colour
came
to
his
cheeks
â€œyou
send
me
away
at
the
suggestion
of
my
colleagueâ€
his
eyes
turned
away
from
mine
â€œwe
will
not
discuss
the
question
mr
weld
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
discuss
it
in
justice
to
you
i
will
give
you
the
strongest
recommendation
for
your
next
situation
i
can
say
no
more
i
hope
that
you
will
continue
your
duties
here
until
you
have
found
a
place
elsewhereâ€
my
whole
soul
rose
against
the
injustice
of
it
and
yet
i
had
no
appeal
and
no
redress
i
could
only
bow
and
leave
the
room
with
a
bitter
sense
of
ill-usage
at
my
heart
my
first
instinct
was
to
pack
my
boxes
and
leave
the
house
but
the
head
master
had
given
me
permission
to
remain
until
i
had
found
another
situation
i
was
sure
that
st
james
desired
me
to
go
and
that
was
a
strong
reason
why
i
should
stay
if
my
presence
annoyed
him
i
should
give
him
as
much
of
it
as
i
could
i
had
begun
to
hate
him
and
to
long
to
have
my
revenge
upon
him
if
he
had
a
hold
over
our
principal
might
not
i
in
turn
obtain
one
over
him
it
was
a
sign
of
weakness
that
he
should
be
so
afraid
of
my
curiosity
he
would
not
resent
it
so
much
if
he
had
not
something
to
fear
from
it
i
entered
my
name
once
more
upon
the
books
of
the
agents
but
meanwhile
i
continued
to
fulfil
my
duties
at
willow
lea
house
and
so
it
came
about
that
i
was
present
at
the
dã©nouement
of
this
singular
situation
during
that
weekâ€”for
it
was
only
a
week
before
the
crisis
cameâ€”i
was
in
the
habit
of
going
down
each
evening
after
the
work
of
the
day
was
done
to
inquire
about
my
new
arrangements
one
night
it
was
a
cold
and
windy
evening
in
march
i
had
just
stepped
out
from
the
hall
door
when
a
strange
sight
met
my
eyes
a
man
was
crouching
before
one
of
the
windows
of
the
house
his
knees
were
bent
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
small
line
of
light
between
the
curtain
and
the
sash
the
window
threw
a
square
of
brightness
in
front
of
it
and
in
the
middle
of
this
the
dark
shadow
of
this
ominous
visitor
showed
clear
and
hard
it
was
but
for
an
instant
that
i
saw
him
for
he
glanced
up
and
was
off
in
a
moment
through
the
shrubbery
i
could
hear
the
patter
of
his
feet
as
he
ran
down
the
road
until
it
died
away
in
the
distance
it
was
evidently
my
duty
to
turn
back
and
to
tell
dr
mccarthy
what
i
had
seen
i
found
him
in
his
study
i
had
expected
him
to
be
disturbed
at
such
an
incident
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
state
of
panic
into
which
he
fell
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
white
and
gasping
like
one
who
has
received
a
mortal
blow
â€œwhich
window
mr
weldâ€
he
asked
wiping
his
forehead
â€œwhich
window
was
itâ€
â€œthe
next
to
the
dining-roomâ€”mr
st
jamesâ€™s
windowâ€
â€œdear
me
dear
me
this
is
indeed
unfortunate
a
man
looking
through
mr
st
jamesâ€™s
windowâ€
he
wrung
his
hands
like
a
man
who
is
at
his
witsâ€™
end
what
to
do
â€œi
shall
be
passing
the
police-station
sir
would
you
wish
me
to
mention
the
matterâ€
â€œno
noâ€
he
cried
suddenly
mastering
his
extreme
agitation
â€œi
have
no
doubt
that
it
was
some
poor
tramp
who
intended
to
beg
i
attach
no
importance
to
the
incidentâ€”none
at
all
donâ€™t
let
me
detain
you
mr
weld
if
you
wish
to
go
outâ€
i
left
him
sitting
in
his
study
with
reassuring
words
upon
his
lips
but
with
horror
upon
his
face
my
heart
was
heavy
for
my
little
employer
as
i
started
off
once
more
for
town
as
i
looked
back
from
the
gate
at
the
square
of
light
which
marked
the
window
of
my
colleague
i
suddenly
saw
the
black
outline
of
dr
mccarthyâ€™s
figure
passing
against
the
lamp
he
had
hastened
from
his
study
then
to
tell
st
james
what
he
had
heard
what
was
the
meaning
of
it
all
this
atmosphere
of
mystery
this
inexplicable
terror
these
confidences
between
two
such
dissimilar
men
i
thought
and
thought
as
i
walked
but
do
what
i
would
i
could
not
hit
upon
any
adequate
conclusion
i
little
knew
how
near
i
was
to
the
solution
of
the
problem
it
was
very
lateâ€”nearly
twelve
oâ€™clockâ€”when
i
returned
and
the
lights
were
all
out
save
one
in
the
doctorâ€™s
study
the
black
gloomy
house
loomed
before
me
as
i
walked
up
the
drive
its
sombre
bulk
broken
only
by
the
one
glimmering
point
of
brightness
i
let
myself
in
with
my
latch-key
and
was
about
to
enter
my
own
room
when
my
attention
was
arrested
by
a
short
sharp
cry
like
that
of
a
man
in
pain
i
stood
and
listened
my
hand
upon
the
handle
of
my
door
all
was
silent
in
the
house
save
for
a
distant
murmur
of
voices
which
came
i
knew
from
the
doctorâ€™s
room
i
stole
quietly
down
the
corridor
in
that
direction
the
sound
resolved
itself
now
into
two
voices
the
rough
bullying
tones
of
st
james
and
the
lower
tone
of
the
doctor
the
one
apparently
insisting
and
the
other
arguing
and
pleading
four
thin
lines
of
light
in
the
blackness
showed
me
the
door
of
the
doctorâ€™s
room
and
step
by
step
i
drew
nearer
to
it
in
the
darkness
st
jamesâ€™s
voice
within
rose
louder
and
louder
and
his
words
now
came
plainly
to
my
ear
â€œiâ€™ll
have
every
pound
of
it
if
you
wonâ€™t
give
it
me
iâ€™ll
take
it
do
you
hearâ€
dr
mccarthyâ€™s
reply
was
inaudible
but
the
angry
voice
broke
in
again
â€œleave
you
destitute
i
leave
you
this
little
goldmine
of
a
school
and
thatâ€™s
enough
for
one
old
man
is
it
not
how
am
i
to
set
up
in
australia
without
money
answer
me
thatâ€
again
the
doctor
said
something
in
a
soothing
voice
but
his
answer
only
roused
his
companion
to
a
higher
pitch
of
fury
â€œdone
for
me
what
have
you
ever
done
for
me
except
what
you
couldnâ€™t
help
doing
it
was
for
your
good
name
not
for
my
safety
that
you
cared
but
enough
cackle
i
must
get
on
my
way
before
morning
will
you
open
your
safe
or
will
you
notâ€
â€œoh
james
how
can
you
use
me
soâ€
cried
a
wailing
voice
and
then
there
came
a
sudden
little
scream
of
pain
at
the
sound
of
that
helpless
appeal
from
brutal
violence
i
lost
for
once
that
temper
upon
which
i
had
prided
myself
every
bit
of
manhood
in
me
cried
out
against
any
further
neutrality
with
my
walking
cane
in
my
hand
i
rushed
into
the
study
as
i
did
so
i
was
conscious
that
the
hall-door
bell
was
violently
ringing
â€œyou
villainâ€
i
cried
â€œlet
him
goâ€
the
two
men
were
standing
in
front
of
a
small
safe
which
stood
against
one
wall
of
the
doctorâ€™s
room
st
james
held
the
old
man
by
the
wrist
and
he
had
twisted
his
arm
round
in
order
to
force
him
to
produce
the
key
my
little
head
master
white
but
resolute
was
struggling
furiously
in
the
grip
of
the
burly
athlete
the
bully
glared
over
his
shoulder
at
me
with
a
mixture
of
fury
and
terror
upon
his
brutal
features
then
realizing
that
i
was
alone
he
dropped
his
victim
and
made
for
me
with
a
horrible
curse
â€œyou
infernal
spyâ€
he
cried
â€œiâ€™ll
do
for
you
anyhow
before
i
leaveâ€
i
am
not
a
very
strong
man
and
i
realized
that
i
was
helpless
if
once
at
close
quarters
twice
i
cut
at
him
with
my
stick
but
he
rushed
in
at
me
with
a
murderous
growl
and
seized
me
by
the
throat
with
both
his
muscular
hands
i
fell
backwards
and
he
on
the
top
of
me
with
a
grip
which
was
squeezing
the
life
from
me
i
was
conscious
of
his
malignant
yellow-tinged
eyes
within
a
few
inches
of
my
own
and
then
with
a
beating
of
pulses
in
my
head
and
a
singing
in
my
ears
my
senses
slipped
away
from
me
but
even
in
that
supreme
moment
i
was
aware
that
the
door-bell
was
still
violently
ringing
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
lying
upon
the
sofa
in
dr
mccarthyâ€™s
study
and
the
doctor
himself
was
seated
beside
me
he
appeared
to
be
watching
me
intently
and
anxiously
for
as
i
opened
my
eyes
and
looked
about
me
he
gave
a
great
cry
of
relief
â€œthank
godâ€
he
cried
â€œthank
godâ€
â€œwhere
is
heâ€
i
asked
looking
round
the
room
as
i
did
so
i
became
aware
that
the
furniture
was
scattered
in
every
direction
and
that
there
were
traces
of
an
even
more
violent
struggle
than
that
in
which
i
had
been
engaged
the
doctor
sank
his
face
between
his
hands
â€œthey
have
himâ€
he
groaned
â€œafter
these
years
of
trial
they
have
him
again
but
how
thankful
i
am
that
he
has
not
for
a
second
time
stained
his
hands
in
bloodâ€
as
the
doctor
spoke
i
became
aware
that
a
man
in
the
braided
jacket
of
an
inspector
of
police
was
standing
in
the
doorway
â€œyes
sirâ€
he
remarked
â€œyou
have
had
a
pretty
narrow
escape
if
we
had
not
got
in
when
we
did
you
would
not
be
here
to
tell
the
tale
i
donâ€™t
know
that
i
ever
saw
any
one
much
nearer
to
the
undertakerâ€
i
sat
up
with
my
hands
to
my
throbbing
head
â€œdr
mccarthyâ€
said
i
â€œthis
is
all
a
mystery
to
me
i
should
be
glad
if
you
could
explain
to
me
who
this
man
is
and
why
you
have
tolerated
him
so
long
in
your
houseâ€
â€œi
owe
you
an
explanation
mr
weldâ€”and
the
more
so
since
you
have
in
so
chivalrous
a
fashion
almost
sacrificed
your
life
in
my
defence
there
is
no
reason
now
for
secrecy
in
a
word
mr
weld
this
unhappy
manâ€™s
real
name
is
james
mccarthy
and
he
is
my
only
sonâ€
â€œyour
sonâ€
â€œalas
yes
what
sin
have
i
ever
committed
that
i
should
have
such
a
punishment
he
has
made
my
whole
life
a
misery
from
the
first
years
of
his
boyhood
violent
headstrong
selfish
unprincipled
he
has
always
been
the
same
at
eighteen
he
was
a
criminal
at
twenty
in
a
paroxysm
of
passion
he
took
the
life
of
a
boon
companion
and
was
tried
for
murder
he
only
just
escaped
the
gallows
and
he
was
condemned
to
penal
servitude
three
years
ago
he
succeeded
in
escaping
and
managed
in
face
of
a
thousand
obstacles
to
reach
my
house
in
london
my
wifeâ€™s
heart
had
been
broken
by
his
condemnation
and
as
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
a
suit
of
ordinary
clothes
there
was
no
one
here
to
recognize
him
for
months
he
lay
concealed
in
the
attics
until
the
first
search
of
the
police
should
be
over
then
i
gave
him
employment
here
as
you
have
seen
though
by
his
rough
and
overbearing
manners
he
made
my
own
life
miserable
and
that
of
his
fellow-masters
unbearable
you
have
been
with
us
for
four
months
mr
weld
but
no
other
master
endured
him
so
long
i
apologize
now
for
all
you
have
had
to
submit
to
but
i
ask
you
what
else
could
i
do
for
his
dead
motherâ€™s
sake
i
could
not
let
harm
come
to
him
as
long
as
it
was
in
my
power
to
fend
it
off
only
under
my
roof
could
he
find
a
refugeâ€”the
only
spot
in
all
the
worldâ€”and
how
could
i
keep
him
here
without
its
exciting
remark
unless
i
gave
him
some
occupation
i
made
him
english
master
therefore
and
in
that
capacity
i
have
protected
him
here
for
three
years
you
have
no
doubt
observed
that
he
never
during
the
daytime
went
beyond
the
college
grounds
you
now
understand
the
reason
but
when
to-night
you
came
to
me
with
your
report
of
a
man
who
was
looking
through
his
window
i
understood
that
his
retreat
was
at
last
discovered
i
besought
him
to
fly
at
once
but
he
had
been
drinking
the
unhappy
fellow
and
my
words
fell
upon
deaf
ears
when
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
he
wished
to
take
from
me
in
his
flight
every
shilling
which
i
possessed
it
was
your
entrance
which
saved
me
from
him
while
the
police
in
turn
arrived
only
just
in
time
to
rescue
you
i
have
made
myself
amenable
to
the
law
by
harbouring
an
escaped
prisoner
and
remain
here
in
the
custody
of
the
inspector
but
a
prison
has
no
terrors
for
me
after
what
i
have
endured
in
this
house
during
the
last
three
yearsâ€
â€œit
seems
to
me
doctorâ€
said
the
inspector
â€œthat
if
you
have
broken
the
law
you
have
had
quite
enough
punishment
alreadyâ€
â€œgod
knows
i
haveâ€
cried
dr
mccarthy
and
sank
his
haggard
face
upon
his
hands
the
brown
hand
every
one
knows
that
sir
dominick
holden
the
famous
indian
surgeon
made
me
his
heir
and
that
his
death
changed
me
in
an
hour
from
a
hard-working
and
impecunious
medical
man
to
a
well-to-do
landed
proprietor
many
know
also
that
there
were
at
least
five
people
between
the
inheritance
and
me
and
that
sir
dominickâ€™s
selection
appeared
to
be
altogether
arbitrary
and
whimsical
i
can
assure
them
however
that
they
are
quite
mistaken
and
that
although
i
only
knew
sir
dominick
in
the
closing
years
of
his
life
there
were
none
the
less
very
real
reasons
why
he
should
show
his
goodwill
towards
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
i
say
it
myself
no
man
ever
did
more
for
another
than
i
did
for
my
indian
uncle
i
cannot
expect
the
story
to
be
believed
but
it
is
so
singular
that
i
should
feel
that
it
was
a
breach
of
duty
if
i
did
not
put
it
upon
recordâ€”so
here
it
is
and
your
belief
or
incredulity
is
your
own
affair
sir
dominick
holden
cb
kcsi
and
i
donâ€™t
know
what
besides
was
the
most
distinguished
indian
surgeon
of
his
day
in
the
army
originally
he
afterwards
settled
down
into
civil
practice
in
bombay
and
visited
as
a
consultant
every
part
of
india
his
name
is
best
remembered
in
connection
with
the
oriental
hospital
which
he
founded
and
supported
the
time
came
however
when
his
iron
constitution
began
to
show
signs
of
the
long
strain
to
which
he
had
subjected
it
and
his
brother
practitioners
who
were
not
perhaps
entirely
disinterested
upon
the
point
were
unanimous
in
recommending
him
to
return
to
england
he
held
on
so
long
as
he
could
but
at
last
he
developed
nervous
symptoms
of
a
very
pronounced
character
and
so
came
back
a
broken
man
to
his
native
county
of
wiltshire
he
bought
a
considerable
estate
with
an
ancient
manor-house
upon
the
edge
of
salisbury
plain
and
devoted
his
old
age
to
the
study
of
comparative
pathology
which
had
been
his
learned
hobby
all
his
life
and
in
which
he
was
a
foremost
authority
we
of
the
family
were
as
may
be
imagined
much
excited
by
the
news
of
the
return
of
this
rich
and
childless
uncle
to
england
on
his
part
although
by
no
means
exuberant
in
his
hospitality
he
showed
some
sense
of
his
duty
to
his
relations
and
each
of
us
in
turn
had
an
invitation
to
visit
him
from
the
accounts
of
my
cousins
it
appeared
to
be
a
melancholy
business
and
it
was
with
mixed
feelings
that
i
at
last
received
my
own
summons
to
appear
at
rodenhurst
my
wife
was
so
carefully
excluded
in
the
invitation
that
my
first
impulse
was
to
refuse
it
but
the
interests
of
the
children
had
to
be
considered
and
so
with
her
consent
i
set
out
one
october
afternoon
upon
my
visit
to
wiltshire
with
little
thought
of
what
that
visit
was
to
entail
my
uncleâ€™s
estate
was
situated
where
the
arable
land
of
the
plains
begins
to
swell
upwards
into
the
rounded
chalk
hills
which
are
characteristic
of
the
county
as
i
drove
from
dinton
station
in
the
waning
light
of
that
autumn
day
i
was
impressed
by
the
weird
nature
of
the
scenery
the
few
scattered
cottages
of
the
peasants
were
so
dwarfed
by
the
huge
evidences
of
prehistoric
life
that
the
present
appeared
to
be
a
dream
and
the
past
to
be
the
obtrusive
and
masterful
reality
the
road
wound
through
the
valleys
formed
by
a
succession
of
grassy
hills
and
the
summit
of
each
was
cut
and
carved
into
the
most
elaborate
fortifications
some
circular
and
some
square
but
all
on
a
scale
which
has
defied
the
winds
and
the
rains
of
many
centuries
some
call
them
roman
and
some
british
but
their
true
origin
and
the
reasons
for
this
particular
tract
of
country
being
so
interlaced
with
entrenchments
have
never
been
finally
made
clear
here
and
there
on
the
long
smooth
olive-coloured
slopes
there
rose
small
rounded
barrows
or
tumuli
beneath
them
lie
the
cremated
ashes
of
the
race
which
cut
so
deeply
into
the
hills
but
their
graves
tell
us
nothing
save
that
a
jar
full
of
dust
represents
the
man
who
once
laboured
under
the
sun
it
was
through
this
weird
country
that
i
approached
my
uncleâ€™s
residence
of
rodenhurst
and
the
house
was
as
i
found
in
due
keeping
with
its
surroundings
two
broken
and
weather-stained
pillars
each
surmounted
by
a
mutilated
heraldic
emblem
flanked
the
entrance
to
a
neglected
drive
a
cold
wind
whistled
through
the
elms
which
lined
it
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
drifting
leaves
at
the
far
end
under
the
gloomy
arch
of
trees
a
single
yellow
lamp
burned
steadily
in
the
dim
half-light
of
the
coming
night
i
saw
a
long
low
building
stretching
out
two
irregular
wings
with
deep
eaves
a
sloping
gambrel
roof
and
walls
which
were
criss-crossed
with
timber
balks
in
the
fashion
of
the
tudors
the
cheery
light
of
a
fire
flickered
in
the
broad
latticed
window
to
the
left
of
the
low-porched
door
and
this
as
it
proved
marked
the
study
of
my
uncle
for
it
was
thither
that
i
was
led
by
his
butler
in
order
to
make
my
hostâ€™s
acquaintance
he
was
cowering
over
his
fire
for
the
moist
chill
of
an
english
autumn
had
set
him
shivering
his
lamp
was
unlit
and
i
only
saw
the
red
glow
of
the
embers
beating
upon
a
huge
craggy
face
with
a
red
indian
nose
and
cheek
and
deep
furrows
and
seams
from
eye
to
chin
the
sinister
marks
of
hidden
volcanic
fires
he
sprang
up
at
my
entrance
with
something
of
an
old-world
courtesy
and
welcomed
me
warmly
to
rodenhurst
at
the
same
time
i
was
conscious
as
the
lamp
was
carried
in
that
it
was
a
very
critical
pair
of
light-blue
eyes
which
looked
out
at
me
from
under
shaggy
eyebrows
like
scouts
beneath
a
bush
and
that
this
outlandish
uncle
of
mine
was
carefully
reading
off
my
character
with
all
the
ease
of
a
practised
observer
and
an
experienced
man
of
the
world
for
my
part
i
looked
at
him
and
looked
again
for
i
had
never
seen
a
man
whose
appearance
was
more
fitted
to
hold
oneâ€™s
attention
his
figure
was
the
framework
of
a
giant
but
he
had
fallen
away
his
coat
dangled
straight
down
in
a
shocking
fashion
from
a
pair
of
broad
and
bony
shoulders
all
his
limbs
were
huge
and
yet
emaciated
and
i
could
not
take
my
gaze
from
his
knobby
wrists
and
long
gnarled
hands
but
his
eyesâ€”those
peering
light-blue
eyesâ€”they
were
the
most
arrestive
of
any
of
his
peculiarities
it
was
not
their
colour
alone
nor
was
it
the
ambush
of
hair
in
which
they
lurked
but
it
was
the
expression
which
i
read
in
them
for
the
appearance
and
bearing
of
the
man
were
masterful
and
one
expected
a
certain
corresponding
arrogance
in
his
eyes
but
instead
of
that
i
read
the
look
which
tells
of
a
spirit
cowed
and
crushed
the
furtive
expectant
look
of
the
dog
whose
master
has
taken
the
whip
from
the
rack
i
formed
my
own
medical
diagnosis
upon
one
glance
at
those
critical
and
yet
appealing
eyes
i
believed
that
he
was
stricken
with
some
mortal
ailment
that
he
knew
himself
to
be
exposed
to
sudden
death
and
that
he
lived
in
terror
of
it
such
was
my
judgmentâ€”a
false
one
as
the
event
showed
but
i
mention
it
that
it
may
help
you
to
realize
the
look
which
i
read
in
his
eyes
my
uncleâ€™s
welcome
was
as
i
have
said
a
courteous
one
and
in
an
hour
or
so
i
found
myself
seated
between
him
and
his
wife
at
a
comfortable
dinner
with
curious
pungent
delicacies
upon
the
table
and
a
stealthy
quick-eyed
oriental
waiter
behind
his
chair
the
old
couple
had
come
round
to
that
tragic
imitation
of
the
dawn
of
life
when
husband
and
wife
having
lost
or
scattered
all
those
who
were
their
intimates
find
themselves
face
to
face
and
alone
once
more
their
work
done
and
the
end
nearing
fast
those
who
have
reached
that
stage
in
sweetness
and
love
who
can
change
their
winter
into
a
gentle
indian
summer
have
come
as
victors
through
the
ordeal
of
life
lady
holden
was
a
small
alert
woman
with
a
kindly
eye
and
her
expression
as
she
glanced
at
him
was
a
certificate
of
character
to
her
husband
and
yet
though
i
read
a
mutual
love
in
their
glances
i
read
also
a
mutual
horror
and
recognized
in
her
face
some
reflection
of
that
stealthy
fear
which
i
detected
in
his
their
talk
was
sometimes
merry
and
sometimes
sad
but
there
was
a
forced
note
in
their
merriment
and
a
naturalness
in
their
sadness
which
told
me
that
a
heavy
heart
beat
upon
either
side
of
me
we
were
sitting
over
our
first
glass
of
wine
and
the
servants
had
left
the
room
when
the
conversation
took
a
turn
which
produced
a
remarkable
effect
upon
my
host
and
hostess
i
cannot
recall
what
it
was
which
started
the
topic
of
the
supernatural
but
it
ended
in
my
showing
them
that
the
abnormal
in
psychical
experiences
was
a
subject
to
which
i
had
like
many
neurologists
devoted
a
great
deal
of
attention
i
concluded
by
narrating
my
experiences
when
as
a
member
of
the
psychical
research
society
i
had
formed
one
of
a
committee
of
three
who
spent
the
night
in
a
haunted
house
our
adventures
were
neither
exciting
nor
convincing
but
such
as
it
was
the
story
appeared
to
interest
my
auditors
in
a
remarkable
degree
they
listened
with
an
eager
silence
and
i
caught
a
look
of
intelligence
between
them
which
i
could
not
understand
lady
holden
immediately
afterwards
rose
and
left
the
room
sir
dominick
pushed
the
cigar-box
over
to
me
and
we
smoked
for
some
little
time
in
silence
that
huge
bony
hand
of
his
was
twitching
as
he
raised
it
with
his
cheroot
to
his
lips
and
i
felt
that
the
manâ€™s
nerves
were
vibrating
like
fiddle-strings
my
instincts
told
me
that
he
was
on
the
verge
of
some
intimate
confidence
and
i
feared
to
speak
lest
i
should
interrupt
it
at
last
he
turned
towards
me
with
a
spasmodic
gesture
like
a
man
who
throws
his
last
scruple
to
the
winds
â€œfrom
the
little
that
i
have
seen
of
you
it
appears
to
me
dr
hardacreâ€
said
he
â€œthat
you
are
the
very
man
i
have
wanted
to
meetâ€
â€œi
am
delighted
to
hear
it
sirâ€
â€œyour
head
seems
to
be
cool
and
steady
you
will
acquit
me
of
any
desire
to
flatter
you
for
the
circumstances
are
too
serious
to
permit
of
insincerities
you
have
some
special
knowledge
upon
these
subjects
and
you
evidently
view
them
from
that
philosophical
standpoint
which
robs
them
of
all
vulgar
terror
i
presume
that
the
sight
of
an
apparition
would
not
seriously
discompose
youâ€
â€œi
think
not
sirâ€
â€œwould
even
interest
you
perhapsâ€
â€œmost
intenselyâ€
â€œas
a
psychical
observer
you
would
probably
investigate
it
in
as
impersonal
a
fashion
as
an
astronomer
investigates
a
wandering
cometâ€
â€œpreciselyâ€
he
gave
a
heavy
sigh
â€œbelieve
me
dr
hardacre
there
was
a
time
when
i
could
have
spoken
as
you
do
now
my
nerve
was
a
by-word
in
india
even
the
mutiny
never
shook
it
for
an
instant
and
yet
you
see
what
i
am
reduced
toâ€”the
most
timorous
man
perhaps
in
all
this
county
of
wiltshire
do
not
speak
too
bravely
upon
this
subject
or
you
may
find
yourself
subjected
to
as
long-drawn
a
test
as
i
amâ€”a
test
which
can
only
end
in
the
madhouse
or
the
graveâ€
i
waited
patiently
until
he
should
see
fit
to
go
farther
in
his
confidence
his
preamble
had
i
need
not
say
filled
me
with
interest
and
expectation
â€œfor
some
years
dr
hardacreâ€
he
continued
â€œmy
life
and
that
of
my
wife
have
been
made
miserable
by
a
cause
which
is
so
grotesque
that
it
borders
upon
the
ludicrous
and
yet
familiarity
has
never
made
it
more
easy
to
bearâ€”on
the
contrary
as
time
passes
my
nerves
become
more
worn
and
shattered
by
the
constant
attrition
if
you
have
no
physical
fears
dr
hardacre
i
should
very
much
value
your
opinion
upon
this
phenomenon
which
troubles
us
soâ€
â€œfor
what
it
is
worth
my
opinion
is
entirely
at
your
service
may
i
ask
the
nature
of
the
phenomenonâ€
â€œi
think
that
your
experiences
will
have
a
higher
evidential
value
if
you
are
not
told
in
advance
what
you
may
expect
to
encounter
you
are
yourself
aware
of
the
quibbles
of
unconscious
cerebration
and
subjective
impressions
with
which
a
scientific
sceptic
may
throw
a
doubt
upon
your
statement
it
would
be
as
well
to
guard
against
them
in
advanceâ€
â€œwhat
shall
i
do
thenâ€
â€œi
will
tell
you
would
you
mind
following
me
this
wayâ€
he
led
me
out
of
the
dining-room
and
down
a
long
passage
until
we
came
to
a
terminal
door
inside
there
was
a
large
bare
room
fitted
as
a
laboratory
with
numerous
scientific
instruments
and
bottles
a
shelf
ran
along
one
side
upon
which
there
stood
a
long
line
of
glass
jars
containing
pathological
and
anatomical
specimens
â€œyou
see
that
i
still
dabble
in
some
of
my
old
studiesâ€
said
sir
dominick
â€œthese
jars
are
the
remains
of
what
was
once
a
most
excellent
collection
but
unfortunately
i
lost
the
greater
part
of
them
when
my
house
was
burned
down
in
bombay
in
â€˜92
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
affair
for
meâ€”in
more
ways
than
one
i
had
examples
of
many
rare
conditions
and
my
splenic
collection
was
probably
unique
these
are
the
survivorsâ€
i
glanced
over
them
and
saw
that
they
really
were
of
a
very
great
value
and
rarity
from
a
pathological
point
of
view
bloated
organs
gaping
cysts
distorted
bones
odious
parasitesâ€”a
singular
exhibition
of
the
products
of
india
â€œthere
is
as
you
see
a
small
settee
hereâ€
said
my
host
â€œit
was
far
from
our
intention
to
offer
a
guest
so
meagre
an
accommodation
but
since
affairs
have
taken
this
turn
it
would
be
a
great
kindness
upon
your
part
if
you
would
consent
to
spend
the
night
in
this
apartment
i
beg
that
you
will
not
hesitate
to
let
me
know
if
the
idea
should
be
at
all
repugnant
to
youâ€
â€œon
the
contraryâ€
i
said
â€œit
is
most
acceptableâ€
â€œmy
own
room
is
the
second
on
the
left
so
that
if
you
should
feel
that
you
are
in
need
of
company
a
call
would
always
bring
me
to
your
sideâ€
â€œi
trust
that
i
shall
not
be
compelled
to
disturb
youâ€
â€œit
is
unlikely
that
i
shall
be
asleep
i
do
not
sleep
much
do
not
hesitate
to
summon
meâ€
and
so
with
this
agreement
we
joined
lady
holden
in
the
drawing-room
and
talked
of
lighter
things
it
was
no
affectation
upon
my
part
to
say
that
the
prospect
of
my
nightâ€™s
adventure
was
an
agreeable
one
i
have
no
pretence
to
greater
physical
courage
than
my
neighbours
but
familiarity
with
a
subject
robs
it
of
those
vague
and
undefined
terrors
which
are
the
most
appalling
to
the
imaginative
mind
the
human
brain
is
capable
of
only
one
strong
emotion
at
a
time
and
if
it
be
filled
with
curiosity
or
scientific
enthusiasm
there
is
no
room
for
fear
it
is
true
that
i
had
my
uncleâ€™s
assurance
that
he
had
himself
originally
taken
this
point
of
view
but
i
reflected
that
the
breakdown
of
his
nervous
system
might
be
due
to
his
forty
years
in
india
as
much
as
to
any
psychical
experiences
which
had
befallen
him
i
at
least
was
sound
in
nerve
and
brain
and
it
was
with
something
of
the
pleasurable
thrill
of
anticipation
with
which
the
sportsman
takes
his
position
beside
the
haunt
of
his
game
that
i
shut
the
laboratory
door
behind
me
and
partially
undressing
lay
down
upon
the
rug-covered
settee
it
was
not
an
ideal
atmosphere
for
a
bedroom
the
air
was
heavy
with
many
chemical
odours
that
of
methylated
spirit
predominating
nor
were
the
decorations
of
my
chamber
very
sedative
the
odious
line
of
glass
jars
with
their
relics
of
disease
and
suffering
stretched
in
front
of
my
very
eyes
there
was
no
blind
to
the
window
and
a
three-quarter
moon
streamed
its
white
light
into
the
room
tracing
a
silver
square
with
filigree
lattices
upon
the
opposite
wall
when
i
had
extinguished
my
candle
this
one
bright
patch
in
the
midst
of
the
general
gloom
had
certainly
an
eerie
and
discomposing
aspect
a
rigid
and
absolute
silence
reigned
throughout
the
old
house
so
that
the
low
swish
of
the
branches
in
the
garden
came
softly
and
soothingly
to
my
ears
it
may
have
been
the
hypnotic
lullaby
of
this
gentle
susurrus
or
it
may
have
been
the
result
of
my
tiring
day
but
after
many
dozings
and
many
efforts
to
regain
my
clearness
of
perception
i
fell
at
last
into
a
deep
and
dreamless
sleep
i
was
awakened
by
some
sound
in
the
room
and
i
instantly
raised
myself
upon
my
elbow
on
the
couch
some
hours
had
passed
for
the
square
patch
upon
the
wall
had
slid
downwards
and
sideways
until
it
lay
obliquely
at
the
end
of
my
bed
the
rest
of
the
room
was
in
deep
shadow
at
first
i
could
see
nothing
presently
as
my
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
faint
light
i
was
aware
with
a
thrill
which
all
my
scientific
absorption
could
not
entirely
prevent
that
something
was
moving
slowly
along
the
line
of
the
wall
a
gentle
shuffling
sound
as
of
soft
slippers
came
to
my
ears
and
i
dimly
discerned
a
human
figure
walking
stealthily
from
the
direction
of
the
door
as
it
emerged
into
the
patch
of
moonlight
i
saw
very
clearly
what
it
was
and
how
it
was
employed
it
was
a
man
short
and
squat
dressed
in
some
sort
of
dark-grey
gown
which
hung
straight
from
his
shoulders
to
his
feet
the
moon
shone
upon
the
side
of
his
face
and
i
saw
that
it
was
chocolate-brown
in
colour
with
a
ball
of
black
hair
like
a
womanâ€™s
at
the
back
of
his
head
he
walked
slowly
and
his
eyes
were
cast
upwards
towards
the
line
of
bottles
which
contained
those
gruesome
remnants
of
humanity
he
seemed
to
examine
each
jar
with
attention
and
then
to
pass
on
to
the
next
when
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
line
immediately
opposite
my
bed
he
stopped
faced
me
threw
up
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
despair
and
vanished
from
my
sight
i
have
said
that
he
threw
up
his
hands
but
i
should
have
said
his
arms
for
as
he
assumed
that
attitude
of
despair
i
observed
a
singular
peculiarity
about
his
appearance
he
had
only
one
hand
as
the
sleeves
drooped
down
from
the
upflung
arms
i
saw
the
left
plainly
but
the
right
ended
in
a
knobby
and
unsightly
stump
in
every
other
way
his
appearance
was
so
natural
and
i
had
both
seen
and
heard
him
so
clearly
that
i
could
easily
have
believed
that
he
was
an
indian
servant
of
sir
dominickâ€™s
who
had
come
into
my
room
in
search
of
something
it
was
only
his
sudden
disappearance
which
suggested
anything
more
sinister
to
me
as
it
was
i
sprang
from
my
couch
lit
a
candle
and
examined
the
whole
room
carefully
there
were
no
signs
of
my
visitor
and
i
was
forced
to
conclude
that
there
had
really
been
something
outside
the
normal
laws
of
nature
in
his
appearance
i
lay
awake
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
but
nothing
else
occurred
to
disturb
me
i
am
an
early
riser
but
my
uncle
was
an
even
earlier
one
for
i
found
him
pacing
up
and
down
the
lawn
at
the
side
of
the
house
he
ran
towards
me
in
his
eagerness
when
he
saw
me
come
out
from
the
door
â€œwell
wellâ€
he
cried
â€œdid
you
see
himâ€
â€œan
indian
with
one
handâ€
â€œpreciselyâ€
â€œyes
i
saw
himâ€â€”and
i
told
him
all
that
occurred
when
i
had
finished
he
led
the
way
into
his
study
â€œwe
have
a
little
time
before
breakfastâ€
said
he
â€œit
will
suffice
to
give
you
an
explanation
of
this
extraordinary
affairâ€”so
far
as
i
can
explain
that
which
is
essentially
inexplicable
in
the
first
place
when
i
tell
you
that
for
four
years
i
have
never
passed
one
single
night
either
in
bombay
aboard
ship
or
here
in
england
without
my
sleep
being
broken
by
this
fellow
you
will
understand
why
it
is
that
i
am
a
wreck
of
my
former
self
his
programme
is
always
the
same
he
appears
by
my
bedside
shakes
me
roughly
by
the
shoulder
passes
from
my
room
into
the
laboratory
walks
slowly
along
the
line
of
my
bottles
and
then
vanishes
for
more
than
a
thousand
times
he
has
gone
through
the
same
routineâ€
â€œwhat
does
he
wantâ€
â€œhe
wants
his
handâ€
â€œhis
handâ€
â€œyes
it
came
about
in
this
way
i
was
summoned
to
peshawur
for
a
consultation
some
ten
years
ago
and
while
there
i
was
asked
to
look
at
the
hand
of
a
native
who
was
passing
through
with
an
afghan
caravan
the
fellow
came
from
some
mountain
tribe
living
away
at
the
back
of
beyond
somewhere
on
the
other
side
of
kaffiristan
he
talked
a
bastard
pushtoo
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
understand
him
he
was
suffering
from
a
soft
sarcomatous
swelling
of
one
of
the
metacarpal
joints
and
i
made
him
realize
that
it
was
only
by
losing
his
hand
that
he
could
hope
to
save
his
life
after
much
persuasion
he
consented
to
the
operation
and
he
asked
me
when
it
was
over
what
fee
i
demanded
the
poor
fellow
was
almost
a
beggar
so
that
the
idea
of
a
fee
was
absurd
but
i
answered
in
jest
that
my
fee
should
be
his
hand
and
that
i
proposed
to
add
it
to
my
pathological
collection
â€œto
my
surprise
he
demurred
very
much
to
the
suggestion
and
he
explained
that
according
to
his
religion
it
was
an
all-important
matter
that
the
body
should
be
reunited
after
death
and
so
make
a
perfect
dwelling
for
the
spirit
the
belief
is
of
course
an
old
one
and
the
mummies
of
the
egyptians
arose
from
an
analogous
superstition
i
answered
him
that
his
hand
was
already
off
and
asked
him
how
he
intended
to
preserve
it
he
replied
that
he
would
pickle
it
in
salt
and
carry
it
about
with
him
i
suggested
that
it
might
be
safer
in
my
keeping
than
in
his
and
that
i
had
better
means
than
salt
for
preserving
it
on
realizing
that
i
really
intended
to
carefully
keep
it
his
opposition
vanished
instantly
â€˜but
remember
sahibâ€™
said
he
â€˜i
shall
want
it
back
when
i
am
deadâ€™
i
laughed
at
the
remark
and
so
the
matter
ended
i
returned
to
my
practice
and
he
no
doubt
in
the
course
of
time
was
able
to
continue
his
journey
to
afghanistan
â€œwell
as
i
told
you
last
night
i
had
a
bad
fire
in
my
house
at
bombay
half
of
it
was
burned
down
and
among
other
things
my
pathological
collection
was
largely
destroyed
what
you
see
are
the
poor
remains
of
it
the
hand
of
the
hillman
went
with
the
rest
but
i
gave
the
matter
no
particular
thought
at
the
time
that
was
six
years
ago
â€œfour
years
agoâ€”two
years
after
the
fireâ€”i
was
awakened
one
night
by
a
furious
tugging
at
my
sleeve
i
sat
up
under
the
impression
that
my
favourite
mastiff
was
trying
to
arouse
me
instead
of
this
i
saw
my
indian
patient
of
long
ago
dressed
in
the
long
grey
gown
which
was
the
badge
of
his
people
he
was
holding
up
his
stump
and
looking
reproachfully
at
me
he
then
went
over
to
my
bottles
which
at
that
time
i
kept
in
my
room
and
he
examined
them
carefully
after
which
he
gave
a
gesture
of
anger
and
vanished
i
realized
that
he
had
just
died
and
that
he
had
come
to
claim
my
promise
that
i
should
keep
his
limb
in
safety
for
him
â€œwell
there
you
have
it
all
dr
hardacre
every
night
at
the
same
hour
for
four
years
this
performance
has
been
repeated
it
is
a
simple
thing
in
itself
but
it
has
worn
me
out
like
water
dropping
on
a
stone
it
has
brought
a
vile
insomnia
with
it
for
i
cannot
sleep
now
for
the
expectation
of
his
coming
it
has
poisoned
my
old
age
and
that
of
my
wife
who
has
been
the
sharer
in
this
great
trouble
but
there
is
the
breakfast
gong
and
she
will
be
waiting
impatiently
to
know
how
it
fared
with
you
last
night
we
are
both
much
indebted
to
you
for
your
gallantry
for
it
takes
something
from
the
weight
of
our
misfortune
when
we
share
it
even
for
a
single
night
with
a
friend
and
it
reassures
us
as
to
our
sanity
which
we
are
sometimes
driven
to
questionâ€
this
was
the
curious
narrative
which
sir
dominick
confided
to
meâ€”a
story
which
to
many
would
have
appeared
to
be
a
grotesque
impossibility
but
which
after
my
experience
of
the
night
before
and
my
previous
knowledge
of
such
things
i
was
prepared
to
accept
as
an
absolute
fact
i
thought
deeply
over
the
matter
and
brought
the
whole
range
of
my
reading
and
experience
to
bear
upon
it
after
breakfast
i
surprised
my
host
and
hostess
by
announcing
that
i
was
returning
to
london
by
the
next
train
â€œmy
dear
doctorâ€
cried
sir
dominick
in
great
distress
â€œyou
make
me
feel
that
i
have
been
guilty
of
a
gross
breach
of
hospitality
in
intruding
this
unfortunate
matter
upon
you
i
should
have
borne
my
own
burdenâ€
â€œit
is
indeed
that
matter
which
is
taking
me
to
londonâ€
i
answered
â€œbut
you
are
mistaken
i
assure
you
if
you
think
that
my
experience
of
last
night
was
an
unpleasant
one
to
me
on
the
contrary
i
am
about
to
ask
your
permission
to
return
in
the
evening
and
spend
one
more
night
in
your
laboratory
i
am
very
eager
to
see
this
visitor
once
againâ€
my
uncle
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
know
what
i
was
about
to
do
but
my
fears
of
raising
false
hopes
prevented
me
from
telling
him
i
was
back
in
my
own
consulting-room
a
little
after
luncheon
and
was
confirming
my
memory
of
a
passage
in
a
recent
book
upon
occultism
which
had
arrested
my
attention
when
i
read
it
â€œin
the
case
of
earth-bound
spiritsâ€
said
my
authority
â€œsome
one
dominant
idea
obsessing
them
at
the
hour
of
death
is
sufficient
to
hold
them
to
this
material
world
they
are
the
amphibia
of
this
life
and
of
the
next
capable
of
passing
from
one
to
the
other
as
the
turtle
passes
from
land
to
water
the
causes
which
may
bind
a
soul
so
strongly
to
a
life
which
its
body
has
abandoned
are
any
violent
emotion
avarice
revenge
anxiety
love
and
pity
have
all
been
known
to
have
this
effect
as
a
rule
it
springs
from
some
unfulfilled
wish
and
when
the
wish
has
been
fulfilled
the
material
bond
relaxes
there
are
many
cases
upon
record
which
show
the
singular
persistence
of
these
visitors
and
also
their
disappearance
when
their
wishes
have
been
fulfilled
or
in
some
cases
when
a
reasonable
compromise
has
been
effectedâ€
â€œa
reasonable
compromise
effectedâ€â€”those
were
the
words
which
i
had
brooded
over
all
the
morning
and
which
i
now
verified
in
the
original
no
actual
atonement
could
be
made
hereâ€”but
a
reasonable
compromise
i
made
my
way
as
fast
as
a
train
could
take
me
to
the
shadwell
seamenâ€™s
hospital
where
my
old
friend
jack
hewett
was
house-surgeon
without
explaining
the
situation
i
made
him
understand
exactly
what
it
was
that
i
wanted
â€œa
brown
manâ€™s
handâ€
said
he
in
amazement
â€œwhat
in
the
world
do
you
want
that
forâ€
â€œnever
mind
iâ€™ll
tell
you
some
day
i
know
that
your
wards
are
full
of
indiansâ€
â€œi
should
think
so
but
a
handâ€”â€”â€
he
thought
a
little
and
then
struck
a
bell
â€œtraversâ€
said
he
to
a
student-dresser
â€œwhat
became
of
the
hands
of
the
lascar
which
we
took
off
yesterday
i
mean
the
fellow
from
the
east
india
dock
who
got
caught
in
the
steam
winchâ€
â€œthey
are
in
the
post-mortem
room
sirâ€
â€œjust
pack
one
of
them
in
antiseptics
and
give
it
to
dr
hardacreâ€
and
so
i
found
myself
back
at
rodenhurst
before
dinner
with
this
curious
outcome
of
my
day
in
town
i
still
said
nothing
to
sir
dominick
but
i
slept
that
night
in
the
laboratory
and
i
placed
the
lascarâ€™s
hand
in
one
of
the
glass
jars
at
the
end
of
my
couch
so
interested
was
i
in
the
result
of
my
experiment
that
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
i
sat
with
a
shaded
lamp
beside
me
and
waited
patiently
for
my
visitor
this
time
i
saw
him
clearly
from
the
first
he
appeared
beside
the
door
nebulous
for
an
instant
and
then
hardening
into
as
distinct
an
outline
as
any
living
man
the
slippers
beneath
his
grey
gown
were
red
and
heelless
which
accounted
for
the
low
shuffling
sound
which
he
made
as
he
walked
as
on
the
previous
night
he
passed
slowly
along
the
line
of
bottles
until
he
paused
before
that
which
contained
the
hand
he
reached
up
to
it
his
whole
figure
quivering
with
expectation
took
it
down
examined
it
eagerly
and
then
with
a
face
which
was
convulsed
with
fury
and
disappointment
he
hurled
it
down
on
the
floor
there
was
a
crash
which
resounded
through
the
house
and
when
i
looked
up
the
mutilated
indian
had
disappeared
a
moment
later
my
door
flew
open
and
sir
dominick
rushed
in
â€œyou
are
not
hurtâ€
he
cried
â€œnoâ€”but
deeply
disappointedâ€
he
looked
in
astonishment
at
the
splinters
of
glass
and
the
brown
hand
lying
upon
the
floor
â€œgood
godâ€
he
cried
â€œwhat
is
thisâ€
i
told
him
my
idea
and
its
wretched
sequel
he
listened
intently
but
shook
his
head
â€œit
was
well
thought
ofâ€
said
he
â€œbut
i
fear
that
there
is
no
such
easy
end
to
my
sufferings
but
one
thing
i
now
insist
upon
it
is
that
you
shall
never
again
upon
any
pretext
occupy
this
room
my
fears
that
something
might
have
happened
to
youâ€”when
i
heard
that
crashâ€”have
been
the
most
acute
of
all
the
agonies
which
i
have
undergone
i
will
not
expose
myself
to
a
repetition
of
itâ€
he
allowed
me
however
to
spend
the
remainder
of
that
night
where
i
was
and
i
lay
there
worrying
over
the
problem
and
lamenting
my
own
failure
with
the
first
light
of
morning
there
was
the
lascarâ€™s
hand
still
lying
upon
the
floor
to
remind
me
of
my
fiasco
i
lay
looking
at
itâ€”and
as
i
lay
suddenly
an
idea
flew
like
a
bullet
through
my
head
and
brought
me
quivering
with
excitement
out
of
my
couch
i
raised
the
grim
relic
from
where
it
had
fallen
yes
it
was
indeed
so
the
hand
was
the
left
hand
of
the
lascar
by
the
first
train
i
was
on
my
way
to
town
and
hurried
at
once
to
the
seamenâ€™s
hospital
i
remembered
that
both
hands
of
the
lascar
had
been
amputated
but
i
was
terrified
lest
the
precious
organ
which
i
was
in
search
of
might
have
been
already
consumed
in
the
crematory
my
suspense
was
soon
ended
it
had
still
been
preserved
in
the
post-mortem
room
and
so
i
returned
to
rodenhurst
in
the
evening
with
my
mission
accomplished
and
the
material
for
a
fresh
experiment
but
sir
dominick
holden
would
not
hear
of
my
occupying
the
laboratory
again
to
all
my
entreaties
he
turned
a
deaf
ear
it
offended
his
sense
of
hospitality
and
he
could
no
longer
permit
it
i
left
the
hand
therefore
as
i
had
done
its
fellow
the
night
before
and
i
occupied
a
comfortable
bedroom
in
another
portion
of
the
house
some
distance
from
the
scene
of
my
adventures
but
in
spite
of
that
my
sleep
was
not
destined
to
be
uninterrupted
in
the
dead
of
night
my
host
burst
into
my
room
a
lamp
in
his
hand
his
huge
gaunt
figure
was
enveloped
in
a
loose
dressing-gown
and
his
whole
appearance
might
certainly
have
seemed
more
formidable
to
a
weak-nerved
man
than
that
of
the
indian
of
the
night
before
but
it
was
not
his
entrance
so
much
as
his
expression
which
amazed
me
he
had
turned
suddenly
younger
by
twenty
years
at
the
least
his
eyes
were
shining
his
features
radiant
and
he
waved
one
hand
in
triumph
over
his
head
i
sat
up
astounded
staring
sleepily
at
this
extraordinary
visitor
but
his
words
soon
drove
the
sleep
from
my
eyes
â€œwe
have
done
it
we
have
succeededâ€
he
shouted
â€œmy
dear
hardacre
how
can
i
ever
in
this
world
repay
youâ€
â€œyou
donâ€™t
mean
to
say
that
it
is
all
rightâ€
â€œindeed
i
do
i
was
sure
that
you
would
not
mind
being
awakened
to
hear
such
blessed
newsâ€
â€œmind
i
should
think
not
indeed
but
is
it
really
certainâ€
â€œi
have
no
doubt
whatever
upon
the
point
i
owe
you
such
a
debt
my
dear
nephew
as
i
have
never
owed
a
man
before
and
never
expected
to
what
can
i
possibly
do
for
you
that
is
commensurate
providence
must
have
sent
you
to
my
rescue
you
have
saved
both
my
reason
and
my
life
for
another
six
months
of
this
must
have
seen
me
either
in
a
cell
or
a
coffin
and
my
wifeâ€”it
was
wearing
her
out
before
my
eyes
never
could
i
have
believed
that
any
human
being
could
have
lifted
this
burden
off
meâ€
he
seized
my
hand
and
wrung
it
in
his
bony
grip
â€œit
was
only
an
experimentâ€”a
forlorn
hopeâ€”but
i
am
delighted
from
my
heart
that
it
has
succeeded
but
how
do
you
know
that
it
is
all
right
have
you
seen
somethingâ€
he
seated
himself
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
â€œi
have
seen
enoughâ€
said
he
â€œit
satisfies
me
that
i
shall
be
troubled
no
more
what
has
passed
is
easily
told
you
know
that
at
a
certain
hour
this
creature
always
comes
to
me
to-night
he
arrived
at
the
usual
time
and
aroused
me
with
even
more
violence
than
is
his
custom
i
can
only
surmise
that
his
disappointment
of
last
night
increased
the
bitterness
of
his
anger
against
me
he
looked
angrily
at
me
and
then
went
on
his
usual
round
but
in
a
few
minutes
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
since
this
persecution
began
return
to
my
chamber
he
was
smiling
i
saw
the
gleam
of
his
white
teeth
through
the
dim
light
he
stood
facing
me
at
the
end
of
my
bed
and
three
times
he
made
the
low
eastern
salaam
which
is
their
solemn
leave-taking
and
the
third
time
that
he
bowed
he
raised
his
arms
over
his
head
and
i
saw
his
two
hands
outstretched
in
the
air
so
he
vanished
and
as
i
believe
for
everâ€





so
that
is
the
curious
experience
which
won
me
the
affection
and
the
gratitude
of
my
celebrated
uncle
the
famous
indian
surgeon
his
anticipations
were
realized
and
never
again
was
he
disturbed
by
the
visits
of
the
restless
hillman
in
search
of
his
lost
member
sir
dominick
and
lady
holden
spent
a
very
happy
old
age
unclouded
so
far
as
i
know
by
any
trouble
and
they
finally
died
during
the
great
influenza
epidemic
within
a
few
weeks
of
each
other
in
his
lifetime
he
always
turned
to
me
for
advice
in
everything
which
concerned
that
english
life
of
which
he
knew
so
little
and
i
aided
him
also
in
the
purchase
and
development
of
his
estates
it
was
no
great
surprise
to
me
therefore
that
i
found
myself
eventually
promoted
over
the
heads
of
five
exasperated
cousins
and
changed
in
a
single
day
from
a
hard-working
country
doctor
into
the
head
of
an
important
wiltshire
family
i
at
least
have
reason
to
bless
the
memory
of
the
man
with
the
brown
hand
and
the
day
when
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
relieve
rodenhurst
of
his
unwelcome
presence
the
fiend
of
the
cooperage
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
bring
the
gamecock
up
to
the
island
for
the
river
had
swept
down
so
much
silt
that
the
banks
extended
for
many
miles
out
into
the
atlantic
the
coast
was
hardly
to
be
seen
when
the
first
white
curl
of
the
breakers
warned
us
of
our
danger
and
from
there
onwards
we
made
our
way
very
carefully
under
mainsail
and
jib
keeping
the
broken
water
well
to
the
left
as
is
indicated
on
the
chart
more
than
once
her
bottom
touched
the
sand
we
were
drawing
something
under
six
feet
at
the
time
but
we
had
always
way
enough
and
luck
enough
to
carry
us
through
finally
the
water
shoaled
very
rapidly
but
they
had
sent
a
canoe
from
the
factory
and
the
krooboy
pilot
brought
us
within
two
hundred
yards
of
the
island
here
we
dropped
our
anchor
for
the
gestures
of
the
negro
indicated
that
we
could
not
hope
to
get
any
farther
the
blue
of
the
sea
had
changed
to
the
brown
of
the
river
and
even
under
the
shelter
of
the
island
the
current
was
singing
and
swirling
round
our
bows
the
stream
appeared
to
be
in
spate
for
it
was
over
the
roots
of
the
palm
trees
and
everywhere
upon
its
muddy
greasy
surface
we
could
see
logs
of
wood
and
debris
of
all
sorts
which
had
been
carried
down
by
the
flood
when
i
had
assured
myself
that
we
swung
securely
at
our
moorings
i
thought
it
best
to
begin
watering
at
once
for
the
place
looked
as
if
it
reeked
with
fever
the
heavy
river
the
muddy
shining
banks
the
bright
poisonous
green
of
the
jungle
the
moist
steam
in
the
air
they
were
all
so
many
danger
signals
to
one
who
could
read
them
i
sent
the
long-boat
off
therefore
with
two
large
hogsheads
which
should
be
sufficient
to
last
us
until
we
made
st
paul
de
loanda
for
my
own
part
i
took
the
dinghy
and
rowed
for
the
island
for
i
could
see
the
union
jack
fluttering
above
the
palms
to
mark
the
position
of
armitage
and
wilsonâ€™s
trading
station
when
i
had
cleared
the
grove
i
could
see
the
place
a
long
low
whitewashed
building
with
a
deep
verandah
in
front
and
an
immense
pile
of
palm
oil
barrels
heaped
upon
either
flank
of
it
a
row
of
surf
boats
and
canoes
lay
along
the
beach
and
a
single
small
jetty
projected
into
the
river
two
men
in
white
suits
with
red
cummerbunds
round
their
waists
were
waiting
upon
the
end
of
it
to
receive
me
one
was
a
large
portly
fellow
with
a
greyish
beard
the
other
was
slender
and
tall
with
a
pale
pinched
face
which
was
half
concealed
by
a
great
mushroom-shaped
hat
â€œvery
glad
to
see
youâ€
said
the
latter
cordially
â€œi
am
walker
the
agent
of
armitage
and
wilson
let
me
introduce
dr
severall
of
the
same
company
it
is
not
often
we
see
a
private
yacht
in
these
partsâ€
â€œsheâ€™s
the
gamecockâ€
i
explained
â€œiâ€™m
owner
and
captainâ€”meldrum
is
the
nameâ€
â€œexploringâ€
he
asked
â€œiâ€™m
a
lepidopteristâ€”a
butterfly-catcher
iâ€™ve
been
doing
the
west
coast
from
senegal
downwardsâ€
â€œgood
sportâ€
asked
the
doctor
turning
a
slow
yellow-shot
eye
upon
me
â€œi
have
forty
cases
full
we
came
in
here
to
water
and
also
to
see
what
you
have
in
my
lineâ€
these
introductions
and
explanations
had
filled
up
the
time
whilst
my
two
krooboys
were
making
the
dinghy
fast
then
i
walked
down
the
jetty
with
one
of
my
new
acquaintances
upon
either
side
each
plying
me
with
questions
for
they
had
seen
no
white
man
for
months
â€œwhat
do
we
doâ€
said
the
doctor
when
i
had
begun
asking
questions
in
my
turn
â€œour
business
keeps
us
pretty
busy
and
in
our
leisure
time
we
talk
politicsâ€
â€œyes
by
the
special
mercy
of
providence
severall
is
a
rank
radical
and
i
am
a
good
stiff
unionist
and
we
talk
home
rule
for
two
solid
hours
every
eveningâ€
â€œand
drink
quinine
cocktailsâ€
said
the
doctor
â€œweâ€™re
both
pretty
well
salted
now
but
our
normal
temperature
was
about
103
last
year
i
shouldnâ€™t
as
an
impartial
adviser
recommend
you
to
stay
here
very
long
unless
you
are
collecting
bacilli
as
well
as
butterflies
the
mouth
of
the
ogowai
river
will
never
develop
into
a
health
resortâ€
there
is
nothing
finer
than
the
way
in
which
these
outlying
pickets
of
civilization
distil
a
grim
humour
out
of
their
desolate
situation
and
turn
not
only
a
bold
but
a
laughing
face
upon
the
chances
which
their
lives
may
bring
everywhere
from
sierra
leone
downwards
i
had
found
the
same
reeking
swamps
the
same
isolated
fever-racked
communities
and
the
same
bad
jokes
there
is
something
approaching
to
the
divine
in
that
power
of
man
to
rise
above
his
conditions
and
to
use
his
mind
for
the
purpose
of
mocking
at
the
miseries
of
his
body
â€œdinner
will
be
ready
in
about
half
an
hour
captain
meldrumâ€
said
the
doctor
â€œwalker
has
gone
in
to
see
about
it
heâ€™s
the
housekeeper
this
week
meanwhile
if
you
like
weâ€™ll
stroll
round
and
iâ€™ll
show
you
the
sights
of
the
islandâ€
the
sun
had
already
sunk
beneath
the
line
of
palm
trees
and
the
great
arch
of
the
heaven
above
our
head
was
like
the
inside
of
a
huge
shell
shimmering
with
dainty
pinks
and
delicate
iridescence
no
one
who
has
not
lived
in
a
land
where
the
weight
and
heat
of
a
napkin
become
intolerable
upon
the
knees
can
imagine
the
blessed
relief
which
the
coolness
of
evening
brings
along
with
it
in
this
sweeter
and
purer
air
the
doctor
and
i
walked
round
the
little
island
he
pointing
out
the
stores
and
explaining
the
routine
of
his
work
â€œthereâ€™s
a
certain
romance
about
the
placeâ€
said
he
in
answer
to
some
remark
of
mine
about
the
dulness
of
their
lives
â€œwe
are
living
here
just
upon
the
edge
of
the
great
unknown
up
thereâ€
he
continued
pointing
to
the
north-east
â€œdu
chaillu
penetrated
and
found
the
home
of
the
gorilla
that
is
the
gaboon
countryâ€”the
land
of
the
great
apes
in
this
directionâ€
pointing
to
the
south-east
â€œno
one
has
been
very
far
the
land
which
is
drained
by
this
river
is
practically
unknown
to
europeans
every
log
which
is
carried
past
us
by
the
current
has
come
from
an
undiscovered
country
iâ€™ve
often
wished
that
i
was
a
better
botanist
when
i
have
seen
the
singular
orchids
and
curious-looking
plants
which
have
been
cast
up
on
the
eastern
end
of
the
islandâ€
the
place
which
the
doctor
indicated
was
a
sloping
brown
beach
freely
littered
with
the
flotsam
of
the
stream
at
each
end
was
a
curved
point
like
a
little
natural
breakwater
so
that
a
small
shallow
bay
was
left
between
this
was
full
of
floating
vegetation
with
a
single
huge
splintered
tree
lying
stranded
in
the
middle
of
it
the
current
rippling
against
its
high
black
side
â€œthese
are
all
from
up
countryâ€
said
the
doctor
â€œthey
get
caught
in
our
little
bay
and
then
when
some
extra
freshet
comes
they
are
washed
out
again
and
carried
out
to
seaâ€
â€œwhat
is
the
treeâ€
i
asked
â€œoh
some
kind
of
teak
i
should
imagine
but
pretty
rotten
by
the
look
of
it
we
get
all
sorts
of
big
hardwood
trees
floating
past
here
to
say
nothing
of
the
palms
just
come
in
here
will
youâ€
he
led
the
way
into
a
long
building
with
an
immense
quantity
of
barrel
staves
and
iron
hoops
littered
about
in
it
â€œthis
is
our
cooperageâ€
said
he
â€œwe
have
the
staves
sent
out
in
bundles
and
we
put
them
together
ourselves
now
you
donâ€™t
see
anything
particularly
sinister
about
this
building
do
youâ€
i
looked
round
at
the
high
corrugated
iron
roof
the
white
wooden
walls
and
the
earthen
floor
in
one
corner
lay
a
mattress
and
a
blanket
â€œi
see
nothing
very
alarmingâ€
said
i
â€œand
yet
thereâ€™s
something
out
of
the
common
tooâ€
he
remarked
â€œyou
see
that
bed
well
i
intend
to
sleep
there
to-night
i
donâ€™t
want
to
buck
but
i
think
itâ€™s
a
bit
of
a
test
for
nerveâ€
â€œwhyâ€
â€œoh
there
have
been
some
funny
goings
on
you
were
talking
about
the
monotony
of
our
lives
but
i
assure
you
that
they
are
sometimes
quite
as
exciting
as
we
wish
them
to
be
youâ€™d
better
come
back
to
the
house
now
for
after
sundown
we
begin
to
get
the
fever-fog
up
from
the
marshes
there
you
can
see
it
coming
across
the
riverâ€
i
looked
and
saw
long
tentacles
of
white
vapour
writhing
out
from
among
the
thick
green
underwood
and
crawling
at
us
over
the
broad
swirling
surface
of
the
brown
river
at
the
same
time
the
air
turned
suddenly
dank
and
cold
â€œthereâ€™s
the
dinner
gongâ€
said
the
doctor
â€œif
this
matter
interests
you
iâ€™ll
tell
you
about
it
afterwardsâ€
it
did
interest
me
very
much
for
there
was
something
earnest
and
subdued
in
his
manner
as
he
stood
in
the
empty
cooperage
which
appealed
very
forcibly
to
my
imagination
he
was
a
big
bluff
hearty
man
this
doctor
and
yet
i
had
detected
a
curious
expression
in
his
eyes
as
he
glanced
about
himâ€”an
expression
which
i
would
not
describe
as
one
of
fear
but
rather
that
of
a
man
who
is
alert
and
on
his
guard
â€œby
the
wayâ€
said
i
as
we
returned
to
the
house
â€œyou
have
shown
me
the
huts
of
a
good
many
of
your
native
assistants
but
i
have
not
seen
any
of
the
natives
themselvesâ€
â€œthey
sleep
in
the
hulk
over
yonderâ€
the
doctor
answered
pointing
over
to
one
of
the
banks
â€œindeed
i
should
not
have
thought
in
that
case
that
they
would
need
the
hutsâ€
â€œoh
they
used
the
huts
until
quite
recently
weâ€™ve
put
them
on
the
hulk
until
they
recover
their
confidence
a
little
they
were
all
half
mad
with
fright
so
we
let
them
go
and
nobody
sleeps
on
the
island
except
walker
and
myselfâ€
â€œwhat
frightened
themâ€
i
asked
â€œwell
that
brings
us
back
to
the
same
story
i
suppose
walker
has
no
objection
to
your
hearing
all
about
it
i
donâ€™t
know
why
we
should
make
any
secret
about
it
though
it
is
certainly
a
pretty
bad
businessâ€
he
made
no
further
allusion
to
it
during
the
excellent
dinner
which
had
been
prepared
in
my
honour
it
appeared
that
no
sooner
had
the
little
white
topsail
of
the
gamecock
shown
round
cape
lopez
than
these
kind
fellows
had
begun
to
prepare
their
famous
pepper-potâ€”which
is
the
pungent
stew
peculiar
to
the
west
coastâ€”and
to
boil
their
yams
and
sweet
potatoes
we
sat
down
to
as
good
a
native
dinner
as
one
could
wish
served
by
a
smart
sierra
leone
waiting
boy
i
was
just
remarking
to
myself
that
he
at
least
had
not
shared
in
the
general
flight
when
having
laid
the
dessert
and
wine
upon
the
table
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
turban
â€œanyting
else
i
do
massa
walkerâ€
he
asked
â€œno
i
think
that
is
all
right
moussaâ€
my
host
answered
â€œi
am
not
feeling
very
well
to-night
though
and
i
should
much
prefer
if
you
would
stay
on
the
islandâ€
i
saw
a
struggle
between
his
fears
and
his
duty
upon
the
swarthy
face
of
the
african
his
skin
had
turned
of
that
livid
purplish
tint
which
stands
for
pallor
in
a
negro
and
his
eyes
looked
furtively
about
him
â€œno
no
massa
walkerâ€
he
cried
at
last
â€œyou
better
come
to
the
hulk
with
me
sah
look
after
you
much
better
in
the
hulk
sahâ€
â€œthat
wonâ€™t
do
moussa
white
men
donâ€™t
run
away
from
the
posts
where
they
are
placedâ€
again
i
saw
the
passionate
struggle
in
the
negroâ€™s
face
and
again
his
fears
prevailed
â€œno
use
massa
walker
sahâ€
he
cried
â€œsâ€™elp
me
i
canâ€™t
do
it
if
it
was
yesterday
or
if
it
was
to-morrow
but
this
is
the
third
night
sah
anâ€™
itâ€™s
more
than
i
can
faceâ€
walker
shrugged
his
shoulders
â€œoff
with
you
thenâ€
said
he
â€œwhen
the
mail-boat
comes
you
can
get
back
to
sierra
leone
for
iâ€™ll
have
no
servant
who
deserts
me
when
i
need
him
most
i
suppose
this
is
all
mystery
to
you
or
has
the
doctor
told
you
captain
meldrumâ€
â€œi
showed
captain
meldrum
the
cooperage
but
i
did
not
tell
him
anythingâ€
said
dr
severall
â€œyouâ€™re
looking
bad
walkerâ€
he
added
glancing
at
his
companion
â€œyou
have
a
strong
touch
coming
on
youâ€
â€œyes
iâ€™ve
had
the
shivers
all
day
and
now
my
head
is
like
a
cannon-ball
i
took
ten
grains
of
quinine
and
my
ears
are
singing
like
a
kettle
but
i
want
to
sleep
with
you
in
the
cooperage
to-nightâ€
â€œno
no
my
dear
chap
i
wonâ€™t
hear
of
such
a
thing
you
must
get
to
bed
at
once
and
i
am
sure
meldrum
will
excuse
you
i
shall
sleep
in
the
cooperage
and
i
promise
you
that
iâ€™ll
be
round
with
your
medicine
before
breakfastâ€
it
was
evident
that
walker
had
been
struck
by
one
of
those
sudden
and
violent
attacks
of
remittent
fever
which
are
the
curse
of
the
west
coast
his
sallow
cheeks
were
flushed
and
his
eyes
shining
with
fever
and
suddenly
as
he
sat
there
he
began
to
croon
out
a
song
in
the
high-pitched
voice
of
delirium
â€œcome
come
we
must
get
you
to
bed
old
chapâ€
said
the
doctor
and
with
my
aid
he
led
his
friend
into
his
bedroom
there
we
undressed
him
and
presently
after
taking
a
strong
sedative
he
settled
down
into
a
deep
slumber
â€œheâ€™s
right
for
the
nightâ€
said
the
doctor
as
we
sat
down
and
filled
our
glasses
once
more
â€œsometimes
it
is
my
turn
and
sometimes
his
but
fortunately
we
have
never
been
down
together
i
should
have
been
sorry
to
be
out
of
it
to-night
for
i
have
a
little
mystery
to
unravel
i
told
you
that
i
intended
to
sleep
in
the
cooperageâ€
â€œyes
you
said
soâ€
â€œwhen
i
said
sleep
i
meant
watch
for
there
will
be
no
sleep
for
me
weâ€™ve
had
such
a
scare
here
that
no
native
will
stay
after
sundown
and
i
mean
to
find
out
to-night
what
the
cause
of
it
all
may
be
it
has
always
been
the
custom
for
a
native
watchman
to
sleep
in
the
cooperage
to
prevent
the
barrel
hoops
being
stolen
well
six
days
ago
the
fellow
who
slept
there
disappeared
and
we
have
never
seen
a
trace
of
him
since
it
was
certainly
singular
for
no
canoe
had
been
taken
and
these
waters
are
too
full
of
crocodiles
for
any
man
to
swim
to
shore
what
became
of
the
fellow
or
how
he
could
have
left
the
island
is
a
complete
mystery
walker
and
i
were
merely
surprised
but
the
blacks
were
badly
scared
and
queer
voodoo
tales
began
to
get
about
amongst
them
but
the
real
stampede
broke
out
three
nights
ago
when
the
new
watchman
in
the
cooperage
also
disappearedâ€
â€œwhat
became
of
himâ€
i
asked
â€œwell
we
not
only
donâ€™t
know
but
we
canâ€™t
even
give
a
guess
which
would
fit
the
facts
the
niggers
swear
there
is
a
fiend
in
the
cooperage
who
claims
a
man
every
third
night
they
wouldnâ€™t
stay
in
the
islandâ€”nothing
could
persuade
them
even
moussa
who
is
a
faithful
boy
enough
would
as
you
have
seen
leave
his
master
in
a
fever
rather
than
remain
for
the
night
if
we
are
to
continue
to
run
this
place
we
must
reassure
our
niggers
and
i
donâ€™t
know
any
better
way
of
doing
it
than
by
putting
in
a
night
there
myself
this
is
the
third
night
you
see
so
i
suppose
the
thing
is
due
whatever
it
may
beâ€
â€œhave
you
no
clueâ€
i
asked
â€œwas
there
no
mark
of
violence
no
blood-stain
no
footprints
nothing
to
give
a
hint
as
to
what
kind
of
danger
you
may
have
to
meetâ€
â€œabsolutely
nothing
the
man
was
gone
and
that
was
all
last
time
it
was
old
ali
who
has
been
wharf-tender
here
since
the
place
was
started
he
was
always
as
steady
as
a
rock
and
nothing
but
foul
play
would
take
him
from
his
workâ€
â€œwellâ€
said
i
â€œi
really
donâ€™t
think
that
this
is
a
one-man
job
your
friend
is
full
of
laudanum
and
come
what
might
he
can
be
of
no
assistance
to
you
you
must
let
me
stay
and
put
in
a
night
with
you
at
the
cooperageâ€
â€œwell
now
thatâ€™s
very
good
of
you
meldrumâ€
said
he
heartily
shaking
my
hand
across
the
table
â€œitâ€™s
not
a
thing
that
i
should
have
ventured
to
propose
for
it
is
asking
a
good
deal
of
a
casual
visitor
but
if
you
really
mean
itâ€”â€”â€
â€œcertainly
i
mean
it
if
you
will
excuse
me
a
moment
i
will
hail
the
gamecock
and
let
them
know
that
they
need
not
expect
meâ€
as
we
came
back
from
the
other
end
of
the
little
jetty
we
were
both
struck
by
the
appearance
of
the
night
a
huge
blue-black
pile
of
clouds
had
built
itself
up
upon
the
landward
side
and
the
wind
came
from
it
in
little
hot
pants
which
beat
upon
our
faces
like
the
draught
from
a
blast
furnace
under
the
jetty
the
river
was
swirling
and
hissing
tossing
little
white
spurts
of
spray
over
the
planking
â€œconfound
itâ€
said
doctor
severall
â€œwe
are
likely
to
have
a
flood
on
the
top
of
all
our
troubles
that
rise
in
the
river
means
heavy
rain
up-country
and
when
it
once
begins
you
never
know
how
far
it
will
go
weâ€™ve
had
the
island
nearly
covered
before
now
well
weâ€™ll
just
go
and
see
that
walker
is
comfortable
and
then
if
you
like
weâ€™ll
settle
down
in
our
quartersâ€
the
sick
man
was
sunk
in
a
profound
slumber
and
we
left
him
with
some
crushed
limes
in
a
glass
beside
him
in
case
he
should
awake
with
the
thirst
of
fever
upon
him
then
we
made
our
way
through
the
unnatural
gloom
thrown
by
that
menacing
cloud
the
river
had
risen
so
high
that
the
little
bay
which
i
have
described
at
the
end
of
the
island
had
become
almost
obliterated
through
the
submerging
of
its
flanking
peninsula
the
great
raft
of
driftwood
with
the
huge
black
tree
in
the
middle
was
swaying
up
and
down
in
the
swollen
current
â€œthatâ€™s
one
good
thing
a
flood
will
do
for
usâ€
said
the
doctor
â€œit
carries
away
all
the
vegetable
stuff
which
is
brought
down
on
to
the
east
end
of
the
island
it
came
down
with
the
freshet
the
other
day
and
here
it
will
stay
until
a
flood
sweeps
it
out
into
the
main
stream
well
hereâ€™s
our
room
and
here
are
some
books
and
here
is
my
tobacco
pouch
and
we
must
try
and
put
in
the
night
as
best
we
mayâ€
by
the
light
of
our
single
lantern
the
great
lonely
room
looked
very
gaunt
and
dreary
save
for
the
piles
of
staves
and
heaps
of
hoops
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
it
with
the
exception
of
the
mattress
for
the
doctor
which
had
been
laid
in
the
corner
we
made
a
couple
of
seats
and
a
table
out
of
the
staves
and
settled
down
together
for
a
long
vigil
severall
had
brought
a
revolver
for
me
and
was
himself
armed
with
a
double-barrelled
shot-gun
we
loaded
our
weapons
and
laid
them
cocked
within
reach
of
our
hands
the
little
circle
of
light
and
the
black
shadows
arching
over
us
were
so
melancholy
that
he
went
off
to
the
house
and
returned
with
two
candles
one
side
of
the
cooperage
was
pierced
however
by
several
open
windows
and
it
was
only
by
screening
our
lights
behind
staves
that
we
could
prevent
them
from
being
extinguished
the
doctor
who
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
iron
nerves
had
settled
down
to
a
book
but
i
observed
that
every
now
and
then
he
laid
it
upon
his
knee
and
took
an
earnest
look
all
round
him
for
my
part
although
i
tried
once
or
twice
to
read
i
found
it
impossible
to
concentrate
my
thoughts
upon
the
book
they
would
always
wander
back
to
this
great
empty
silent
room
and
to
the
sinister
mystery
which
overshadowed
it
i
racked
my
brains
for
some
possible
theory
which
would
explain
the
disappearance
of
these
two
men
there
was
the
black
fact
that
they
were
gone
and
not
the
least
tittle
of
evidence
as
to
why
or
whither
and
here
we
were
waiting
in
the
same
placeâ€”waiting
without
an
idea
as
to
what
we
were
waiting
for
i
was
right
in
saying
that
it
was
not
a
one-man
job
it
was
trying
enough
as
it
was
but
no
force
upon
earth
would
have
kept
me
there
without
a
comrade
what
an
endless
tedious
night
it
was
outside
we
heard
the
lapping
and
gurgling
of
the
great
river
and
the
soughing
of
the
rising
wind
within
save
for
our
breathing
the
turning
of
the
doctorâ€™s
pages
and
the
high
shrill
ping
of
an
occasional
mosquito
there
was
a
heavy
silence
once
my
heart
sprang
into
my
mouth
as
severallâ€™s
book
suddenly
fell
to
the
ground
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
his
eyes
on
one
of
the
windows
â€œdid
you
see
anything
meldrumâ€
â€œno
did
youâ€
â€œwell
i
had
a
vague
sense
of
movement
outside
that
windowâ€
he
caught
up
his
gun
and
approached
it
â€œno
thereâ€™s
nothing
to
be
seen
and
yet
i
could
have
sworn
that
something
passed
slowly
across
itâ€
â€œa
palm
leaf
perhapsâ€
said
i
for
the
wind
was
growing
stronger
every
instant
â€œvery
likelyâ€
said
he
and
settled
down
to
his
book
again
but
his
eyes
were
for
ever
darting
little
suspicious
glances
up
at
the
window
i
watched
it
also
but
all
was
quiet
outside
and
then
suddenly
our
thoughts
were
turned
into
a
new
direction
by
the
bursting
of
the
storm
a
blinding
flash
was
followed
by
a
clap
which
shook
the
building
again
and
again
came
the
vivid
white
glare
with
thunder
at
the
same
instant
like
the
flash
and
roar
of
a
monstrous
piece
of
artillery
and
then
down
came
the
tropical
rain
crashing
and
rattling
on
the
corrugated
iron
roofing
of
the
cooperage
the
big
hollow
room
boomed
like
a
drum
from
the
darkness
arose
a
strange
mixture
of
noises
a
gurgling
splashing
tinkling
bubbling
washing
drippingâ€”every
liquid
sound
that
nature
can
produce
from
the
thrashing
and
swishing
of
the
rain
to
the
deep
steady
boom
of
the
river
hour
after
hour
the
uproar
grew
louder
and
more
sustained
â€œmy
wordâ€
said
severall
â€œwe
are
going
to
have
the
father
of
all
the
floods
this
time
well
hereâ€™s
the
dawn
coming
at
last
and
that
is
a
blessing
weâ€™ve
about
exploded
the
third
night
superstition
anyhowâ€
a
grey
light
was
stealing
through
the
room
and
there
was
the
day
upon
us
in
an
instant
the
rain
had
eased
off
but
the
coffee-coloured
river
was
roaring
past
like
a
waterfall
its
power
made
me
fear
for
the
anchor
of
the
gamecock
â€œi
must
get
aboardâ€
said
i
â€œif
she
drags
sheâ€™ll
never
be
able
to
beat
up
the
river
againâ€
â€œthe
island
is
as
good
as
a
breakwaterâ€
the
doctor
answered
â€œi
can
give
you
a
cup
of
coffee
if
you
will
come
up
to
the
houseâ€
i
was
chilled
and
miserable
so
the
suggestion
was
a
welcome
one
we
left
the
ill-omened
cooperage
with
its
mystery
still
unsolved
and
we
splashed
our
way
up
to
the
house
â€œthereâ€™s
the
spirit
lampâ€
said
severall
â€œif
you
would
just
put
a
light
to
it
i
will
see
how
walker
feels
this
morningâ€
he
left
me
but
was
back
in
an
instant
with
a
dreadful
face
â€œheâ€™s
goneâ€
he
cried
hoarsely
the
words
sent
a
thrill
of
horror
through
me
i
stood
with
the
lamp
in
my
hand
glaring
at
him
â€œyes
heâ€™s
goneâ€
he
repeated
â€œcome
and
lookâ€
i
followed
him
without
a
word
and
the
first
thing
that
i
saw
as
i
entered
the
bedroom
was
walker
himself
lying
huddled
on
his
bed
in
the
grey
flannel
sleeping
suit
in
which
i
had
helped
to
dress
him
on
the
night
before
â€œnot
dead
surelyâ€
i
gasped
the
doctor
was
terribly
agitated
his
hands
were
shaking
like
leaves
in
the
wind
â€œheâ€™s
been
dead
some
hoursâ€
â€œwas
it
feverâ€
â€œfever
look
at
his
footâ€
i
glanced
down
and
a
cry
of
horror
burst
from
my
lips
one
foot
was
not
merely
dislocated
but
was
turned
completely
round
in
a
most
grotesque
contortion
â€œgood
godâ€
i
cried
â€œwhat
can
have
done
thisâ€
severall
had
laid
his
hand
upon
the
dead
manâ€™s
chest
â€œfeel
hereâ€
he
whispered
i
placed
my
hand
at
the
same
spot
there
was
no
resistance
the
body
was
absolutely
soft
and
limp
it
was
like
pressing
a
sawdust
doll
â€œthe
breast-bone
is
goneâ€
said
severall
in
the
same
awed
whisper
â€œheâ€™s
broken
to
bits
thank
god
that
he
had
the
laudanum
you
can
see
by
his
face
that
he
died
in
his
sleepâ€
â€œbut
who
can
have
done
thisâ€
â€œiâ€™ve
had
about
as
much
as
i
can
standâ€
said
the
doctor
wiping
his
forehead
â€œi
donâ€™t
know
that
iâ€™m
a
greater
coward
than
my
neighbours
but
this
gets
beyond
me
if
youâ€™re
going
out
to
the
gamecockâ€”â€”â€
â€œcome
onâ€
said
i
and
off
we
started
if
we
did
not
run
it
was
because
each
of
us
wished
to
keep
up
the
last
shadow
of
his
self-respect
before
the
other
it
was
dangerous
in
a
light
canoe
on
that
swollen
river
but
we
never
paused
to
give
the
matter
a
thought
he
bailing
and
i
paddling
we
kept
her
above
water
and
gained
the
deck
of
the
yacht
there
with
two
hundred
yards
of
water
between
us
and
this
cursed
island
we
felt
that
we
were
our
own
men
once
more
â€œwell
go
back
in
an
hour
or
soâ€
said
he
â€œbut
we
need
a
little
time
to
steady
ourselves
i
wouldnâ€™t
have
had
the
niggers
see
me
as
i
was
just
now
for
a
yearâ€™s
salaryâ€
â€œiâ€™ve
told
the
steward
to
prepare
breakfast
then
we
shall
go
backâ€
said
i
â€œbut
in
godâ€™s
name
doctor
severall
what
do
you
make
of
it
allâ€
â€œit
beats
meâ€”beats
me
clean
iâ€™ve
heard
of
voodoo
devilry
and
iâ€™ve
laughed
at
it
with
the
others
but
that
poor
old
walker
a
decent
god-fearing
nineteenth-century
primrose-league
englishman
should
go
under
like
this
without
a
whole
bone
in
his
bodyâ€”itâ€™s
given
me
a
shake
i
wonâ€™t
deny
it
but
look
there
meldrum
is
that
hand
of
yours
mad
or
drunk
or
what
is
itâ€
old
patterson
the
oldest
man
of
my
crew
and
as
steady
as
the
pyramids
had
been
stationed
in
the
bows
with
a
boat-hook
to
fend
off
the
drifting
logs
which
came
sweeping
down
with
the
current
now
he
stood
with
crooked
knees
glaring
out
in
front
of
him
and
one
forefinger
stabbing
furiously
at
the
air
â€œlook
at
itâ€
he
yelled
â€œlook
at
itâ€
and
at
the
same
instant
we
saw
it
a
huge
black
tree
trunk
was
coming
down
the
river
its
broad
glistening
back
just
lapped
by
the
water
and
in
front
of
itâ€”about
three
feet
in
frontâ€”arching
upwards
like
the
figure-head
of
a
ship
there
hung
a
dreadful
face
swaying
slowly
from
side
to
side
it
was
flattened
malignant
as
large
as
a
small
beer-barrel
of
a
faded
fungoid
colour
but
the
neck
which
supported
it
was
mottled
with
a
dull
yellow
and
black
as
it
flew
past
the
gamecock
in
the
swirl
of
the
waters
i
saw
two
immense
coils
roll
up
out
of
some
great
hollow
in
the
tree
and
the
villainous
head
rose
suddenly
to
the
height
of
eight
or
ten
feet
looking
with
dull
skin-covered
eyes
at
the
yacht
an
instant
later
the
tree
had
shot
past
us
and
was
plunging
with
its
horrible
passenger
towards
the
atlantic
â€œwhat
was
itâ€
i
cried
â€œit
is
our
fiend
of
the
cooperageâ€
said
dr
severall
and
he
had
become
in
an
instant
the
same
bluff
self-confident
man
that
he
had
been
before
â€œyes
that
is
the
devil
who
has
been
haunting
our
island
it
is
the
great
python
of
the
gaboonâ€
i
thought
of
the
stories
which
i
had
heard
all
down
the
coast
of
the
monstrous
constrictors
of
the
interior
of
their
periodical
appetite
and
of
the
murderous
effects
of
their
deadly
squeeze
then
it
all
took
shape
in
my
mind
there
had
been
a
freshet
the
week
before
it
had
brought
down
this
huge
hollow
tree
with
its
hideous
occupant
who
knows
from
what
far
distant
tropical
forest
it
may
have
come
it
had
been
stranded
on
the
little
east
bay
of
the
island
the
cooperage
had
been
the
nearest
house
twice
with
the
return
of
its
appetite
it
had
carried
off
the
watchman
last
night
it
had
doubtless
come
again
when
severall
had
thought
he
saw
something
move
at
the
window
but
our
lights
had
driven
it
away
it
had
writhed
onwards
and
had
slain
poor
walker
in
his
sleep
â€œwhy
did
it
not
carry
him
offâ€
i
asked
â€œthe
thunder
and
lightning
must
have
scared
the
brute
away
thereâ€™s
your
steward
meldrum
the
sooner
we
have
breakfast
and
get
back
to
the
island
the
better
or
some
of
those
niggers
might
think
that
we
had
been
frightenedâ€
jellandâ€™s
voyage
â€œwellâ€
said
our
anglo-jap
as
we
all
drew
up
our
chairs
round
the
smoking-room
fire
â€œitâ€™s
an
old
tale
out
yonder
and
may
have
spilt
over
into
print
for
all
i
know
i
donâ€™t
want
to
turn
this
club-room
into
a
chestnut
stall
but
it
is
a
long
way
to
the
yellow
sea
and
it
is
just
as
likely
that
none
of
you
have
ever
heard
of
the
yawl
matilda
and
of
what
happened
to
henry
jelland
and
willy
mcevoy
aboard
of
her
â€œthe
middle
of
the
sixties
was
a
stirring
time
out
in
japan
that
was
just
after
the
simonosaki
bombardment
and
before
the
daimio
affair
there
was
a
tory
party
and
there
was
a
liberal
party
among
the
natives
and
the
question
that
they
were
wrangling
over
was
whether
the
throats
of
the
foreigners
should
be
cut
or
not
i
tell
you
all
politics
have
been
tame
to
me
since
then
if
you
lived
in
a
treaty
port
you
were
bound
to
wake
up
and
take
an
interest
in
them
and
to
make
it
better
the
outsider
had
no
way
of
knowing
how
the
game
was
going
if
the
opposition
won
it
would
not
be
a
newspaper
paragraph
that
would
tell
him
of
it
but
a
good
old
tory
in
a
suit
of
chain
mail
with
a
sword
in
each
hand
would
drop
in
and
let
him
know
all
about
it
in
a
single
upper
cut
â€œof
course
it
makes
men
reckless
when
they
are
living
on
the
edge
of
a
volcano
like
that
just
at
first
they
are
very
jumpy
and
then
there
comes
a
time
when
they
learn
to
enjoy
life
while
they
have
it
i
tell
you
thereâ€™s
nothing
makes
life
so
beautiful
as
when
the
shadow
of
death
begins
to
fall
across
it
time
is
too
precious
to
be
dawdled
away
then
and
a
man
lives
every
minute
of
it
that
was
the
way
with
us
in
yokohama
there
were
many
european
places
of
business
which
had
to
go
on
running
and
the
men
who
worked
them
made
the
place
lively
for
seven
nights
in
the
week
â€œone
of
the
heads
of
the
european
colony
was
randolph
moore
the
big
export
merchant
his
offices
were
in
yokohama
but
he
spent
a
good
deal
of
his
time
at
his
house
up
in
jeddo
which
had
only
just
been
opened
to
the
trade
in
his
absence
he
used
to
leave
his
affairs
in
the
hands
of
his
head
clerk
jelland
whom
he
knew
to
be
a
man
of
great
energy
and
resolution
but
energy
and
resolution
are
two-edged
things
you
know
and
when
they
are
used
against
you
you
donâ€™t
appreciate
them
so
much
â€œit
was
gambling
that
set
jelland
wrong
he
was
a
little
dark-eyed
fellow
with
black
curly
hairâ€”more
than
three-quarters
celt
i
should
imagine
every
night
in
the
week
you
would
see
him
in
the
same
place
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
croupier
at
mathesonâ€™s
rouge
et
noir
table
for
a
long
time
he
won
and
lived
in
better
style
than
his
employer
and
then
came
a
turn
of
luck
and
he
began
to
lose
so
that
at
the
end
of
a
single
week
his
partner
and
he
were
stone
broke
without
a
dollar
to
their
names
â€œthis
partner
was
a
clerk
in
the
employ
of
the
same
firmâ€”a
tall
straw-haired
young
englishman
called
mcevoy
he
was
a
good
boy
enough
at
the
start
but
he
was
clay
in
the
hands
of
jelland
who
fashioned
him
into
a
kind
of
weak
model
of
himself
they
were
for
ever
on
the
prowl
together
but
it
was
jelland
who
led
and
mcevoy
who
followed
lynch
and
i
and
one
or
two
others
tried
to
show
the
youngster
that
he
could
come
to
no
good
along
that
line
and
when
we
were
talking
to
him
we
could
win
him
round
easily
enough
but
five
minutes
of
jelland
would
swing
him
back
again
it
may
have
been
animal
magnetism
or
what
you
like
but
the
little
man
could
pull
the
big
one
along
like
a
sixty-foot
tug
in
front
of
a
full-rigged
ship
even
when
they
had
lost
all
their
money
they
would
still
take
their
places
at
the
table
and
look
on
with
shining
eyes
when
any
one
else
was
raking
in
the
stamps
â€œbut
one
evening
they
could
keep
out
of
it
no
longer
red
had
turned
up
sixteen
times
running
and
it
was
more
than
jelland
could
bear
he
whispered
to
mcevoy
and
then
said
a
word
to
the
croupier
â€œâ€˜certainly
mr
jelland
your
cheque
is
as
good
as
notesâ€™
said
he
â€œjelland
scribbled
a
cheque
and
threw
it
on
the
black
the
card
was
the
king
of
hearts
and
the
croupier
raked
in
the
little
bit
of
paper
jelland
grew
angry
and
mcevoy
white
another
and
a
heavier
cheque
was
written
and
thrown
on
the
table
the
card
was
the
nine
of
diamonds
mcevoy
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hands
and
looked
as
if
he
would
faint
â€˜by
godâ€™
growled
jelland
â€˜i
wonâ€™t
be
beatâ€™
and
he
threw
on
a
cheque
that
covered
the
other
two
the
card
was
the
deuce
of
hearts
a
few
minutes
later
they
were
walking
down
the
bund
with
the
cool
night-air
playing
upon
their
fevered
faces
â€œâ€˜of
course
you
know
what
this
meansâ€™
said
jelland
lighting
a
cheroot
â€˜weâ€™ll
have
to
transfer
some
of
the
office
money
to
our
current
account
thereâ€™s
no
occasion
to
make
a
fuss
over
it
old
moore
wonâ€™t
look
over
the
books
before
easter
if
we
have
any
luck
we
can
easily
replace
it
before
thenâ€™
â€œâ€˜but
if
we
have
no
luckâ€™
faltered
mcevoy
â€œâ€˜tut
man
we
must
take
things
as
they
come
you
stick
to
me
and
iâ€™ll
stick
to
you
and
weâ€™ll
pull
through
together
you
shall
sign
the
cheques
to-morrow
night
and
we
shall
see
if
your
luck
is
better
than
mineâ€™
â€œbut
if
anything
it
was
worse
when
the
pair
rose
from
the
table
on
the
following
evening
they
had
spent
over
â£5000
of
their
employerâ€™s
money
but
the
resolute
jelland
was
as
sanguine
as
ever
â€œâ€˜we
have
a
good
nine
weeks
before
us
before
the
books
will
be
examinedâ€™
said
he
â€˜we
must
play
the
game
out
and
it
will
all
come
straightâ€™
â€œmcevoy
returned
to
his
rooms
that
night
in
an
agony
of
shame
and
remorse
when
he
was
with
jelland
he
borrowed
strength
from
him
but
alone
he
recognized
the
full
danger
of
his
position
and
the
vision
of
his
old
white-capped
mother
in
england
who
had
been
so
proud
when
he
had
received
his
appointment
rose
up
before
him
to
fill
him
with
loathing
and
madness
he
was
still
tossing
upon
his
sleepless
couch
when
his
japanese
servant
entered
the
bedroom
for
an
instant
mcevoy
thought
that
the
long-expected
outbreak
had
come
and
plunged
for
his
revolver
then
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
he
listened
to
the
message
which
the
servant
had
brought
â€œjelland
was
downstairs
and
wanted
to
see
him
â€œwhat
on
earth
could
he
want
at
that
hour
of
night
mcevoy
dressed
hurriedly
and
rushed
downstairs
his
companion
with
a
set
smile
upon
his
lips
which
was
belied
by
the
ghastly
pallor
of
his
face
was
sitting
in
the
dim
light
of
a
solitary
candle
with
a
slip
of
paper
in
his
hands
â€œâ€˜sorry
to
knock
you
up
willyâ€™
said
he
â€˜no
eavesdroppers
i
supposeâ€™
â€œmcevoy
shook
his
head
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
â€œâ€˜well
then
our
little
game
is
played
out
this
note
was
waiting
for
me
at
home
it
is
from
moore
and
says
that
he
will
be
down
on
monday
morning
for
an
examination
of
the
books
it
leaves
us
in
a
tight
placeâ€™
â€œâ€˜mondayâ€™
gasped
mcevoy
â€˜to-day
is

â€œâ€˜saturday
my

3
am
we
have
not
much
time
to

round
inâ€™
â€œâ€˜we

screamed
mcevoy
â€œâ€˜we
soon
will
be
if
you
make
such
an
infernal

said
jelland
harshly
â€˜now
do

pull

â€œâ€˜i

there
must
be
no

we
are

i

there
is
something

â€œmcevoy
stared
â€œâ€˜we

mcevoy
shrinking
back
â€œâ€˜why

itâ€™s

â€œâ€˜yesâ€™
â€œâ€˜well

two

she
has
all

plenty
of

aboard
weâ€™ll
buy
the

to-morrow
morning
and
whatever
we
want
and
get
away
in
her
but
first
weâ€™ll
clear
all
that
is
left
in
the
office
there
are
5000
sovereigns
in
the
safe
after
dark
weâ€™ll
get
them
aboard
the
yawl
and
take
our
chance
of
reaching
california
thereâ€™s
no
use
hesitating
my

for
we
have
no
ghost
of
a
look-in
in

itâ€™s
that

â€œâ€˜iâ€™ll
do

gets

comes
before

he
tapped
the
side-pocket
of
his
coat
and
looked
across
at
his
partner
with
eyes
that
were
full
of
a
sinister
meaning
â€œall
went
well
with
their
plans
next
day
the
matilda
was
bought
without
difficulty
and
though
she
was
a
tiny
craft
for
so
long
a
voyage
had
she
been
larger
two
men
could
not
have
hoped
to
manage
her
she
was
stocked
with
water
during
the
day
and
after
dark
the
two
clerks
brought
down
the
money
from
the
office
and
stowed
it
in
the
hold
before
midnight
they
had
collected
all
their
own
possessions
without
exciting
suspicion
and
at
two
in
the
morning
they
left
their
moorings
and
stole
quietly
out
from
among
the
shipping
they
were
seen
of
course
and
were
set
down
as
keen
yachtsmen
who
were
on
for
a
good
long
sunday
cruise
but
there
was
no
one
who
dreamed
that
that
cruise
would
only
end
either
on
the
american
coast
or
at
the
bottom
of
the
north
pacific
ocean
straining
and
hauling
they
got
their
mainsail
up
and
set
their
foresail
and
jib
there
was
a
slight
breeze
from
the
south-east
and
the
little
craft
went
dipping
along
upon
her
way
seven
miles
from
land
however
the
wind
fell
away
and
they
lay
becalmed
rising
and
falling
on
the
long
swell
of
a
glassy
sea
all
sunday
they
did
not
make
a
mile
and
in
the
evening
yokohama
still
lay
along
the
horizon
â€œon
monday
morning
down
came
randolph
moore
from
jeddo
and
made
straight
for
the
offices
he
had
had
the
tip
from
some
one
that
his
clerks
had
been
spreading
themselves
a
bit
and
that
had
made
him
come
down
out
of
his
usual
routine
but
when
he
reached
his
place
and
found
the
three
juniors
waiting
in
the
street
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
he
knew
that
the
matter
was
serious
â€œâ€˜whatâ€™s
thisâ€™
he
asked
he
was
a
man
of
action
and
a
nasty
chap
to
deal
with
when
he
had
his
topmasts
lowered
â€œâ€˜we
canâ€™t
get
inâ€™
said
the
clerks
â€œâ€˜where
is
mr
jellandâ€™
â€œâ€˜he
has
not
come
to-dayâ€™
â€œâ€˜and
mr
mcevoyâ€™
â€œâ€˜he
has
not
come
eitherâ€™
â€œrandolph
moore
looked
serious
â€˜we
must
have
the
door
downâ€™
said
he
â€œthey
donâ€™t
build
houses
very
solid
in
that
land
of
earthquakes
and
in
a
brace
of
shakes
they
were
all
in
the
office
of
course
the
thing
told
its
own
story
the
safe
was
open
the
money
gone
and
the
clerks
fled
their
employer
lost
no
time
in
talk
â€œâ€˜where
were
they
seen
lastâ€™
â€œâ€˜on
saturday
they
bought
the
matilda
and
started
for
a
cruiseâ€™
â€œsaturday
the
matter
seemed
hopeless
if
they
had
got
two
daysâ€™
start
but
there
was
still
the
shadow
of
a
chance
he
rushed
to
the
beach
and
swept
the
ocean
with
his
glasses
â€œâ€˜my
godâ€™
he
cried
â€˜thereâ€™s
the
matilda
out
yonder
i
know
her
by
the
rake
of
her
mast
i
have
my
hand
upon
the
villains
after
allâ€™
â€œbut
there
was
a
hitch
even
then
no
boat
had
steam
up
and
the
eager
merchant
had
not
patience
to
wait
clouds
were
banking
up
along
the
haunch
of
the
hills
and
there
was
every
sign
of
an
approaching
change
of
weather
a
police
boat
was
ready
with
ten
armed
men
in
her
and
randolph
moore
himself
took
the
tiller
as
she
shot
out
in
pursuit
of
the
becalmed
yawl
â€œjelland
and
mcevoy
waiting
wearily
for
the
breeze
which
never
came
saw
the
dark
speck
which
sprang
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
land
and
grew
larger
with
every
swish
of
the
oars
as
she
drew
nearer
they
could
see
also
that
she
was
packed
with
men
and
the
gleam
of
weapons
told
what
manner
of
men
they
were
jelland
stood
leaning
against
the
tiller
and
he
looked
at
the
threatening
sky
the
limp
sails
and
the
approaching
boat
â€œâ€˜itâ€™s
a
case
with
us
willyâ€™
said
he
â€˜by
the
lord
we
are
two
most
unlucky
devils
for
thereâ€™s
wind
in
that
sky
and
another
hour
would
have
brought
it
to
usâ€™
â€œmcevoy
groaned
â€œâ€˜thereâ€™s
no
good
softening
over
it
my
ladâ€™
said
jelland
â€˜itâ€™s
the
police
boat
right
enough
and
thereâ€™s
old
moore
driving
them
to
row
like
hell
itâ€™ll
be
a
ten-dollar
job
for
every
man
of
themâ€™
â€œwilly
mcevoy
crouched
against
the
side
with
his
knees
on
the
deck
â€˜my
mother
my
poor
old
motherâ€™
he
sobbed
â€œâ€˜sheâ€™ll
never
hear
that
you
have
been
in
the
dock
anywayâ€™
said
jelland
â€˜my
people
never
did
much
for
me
but
i
will
do
that
much
for
them
itâ€™s
no
good
mac
we
can
chuck
our
hands
god
bless
you
old
man
hereâ€™s
the
pistolâ€™
â€œhe
cocked
the
revolver
and
held
the
butt
towards
the
youngster
but
the
other
shrunk
away
from
it
with
little
gasps
and
cries
jelland
glanced
at
the
approaching
boat
it
was
not
more
than
a
few
hundred
yards
away
â€œâ€˜thereâ€™s
no
time
for
nonsenseâ€™
said
he
â€˜damn
it
man
whatâ€™s
the
use
of
flinching
you
swore
itâ€™
â€œâ€˜no
no
jellandâ€™
â€œâ€˜well
anyhow
i
swore
that
neither
of
us
should
be
taken
will
you
do
itâ€™
â€œâ€˜i
canâ€™t
i
canâ€™tâ€™
â€œâ€˜then
i
will
for
youâ€™
â€œthe
rowers
in
the
boat
saw
him
lean
forwards
they
heard
two
pistol
shots
they
saw
him
double
himself
across
the
tiller
and
then
before
the
smoke
had
lifted
they
found
that
they
had
something
else
to
think
of
â€œfor
at
that
instant
the
storm
brokeâ€”one
of
those
short
sudden
squalls
which
are
common
in
these
seas
the
matilda
heeled
over
her
sails
bellied
out
she
plunged
her
lee-rail
into
a
wave
and
was
off
like
a
frightened
deer
jellandâ€™s
body
had
jammed
the
helm
and
she
kept
a
course
right
before
the
wind
and
fluttered
away
over
the
rising
sea
like
a
blown
piece
of
paper
the
rowers
worked
frantically
but
the
yawl
still
drew
ahead
and
in
five
minutes
it
had
plunged
into
the
storm
wrack
never
to
be
seen
again
by
mortal
eye
the
boat
put
back
and
reached
yokohama
with
the
water
washing
half-way
up
to
the
thwarts
â€œand
that
was
how
it
came
that
the
yawl
matilda
with
a
cargo
of
five
thousand
pounds
and
a
crew
of
two
dead
young
men
set
sail
across
the
pacific
ocean
what
the
end
of
jellandâ€™s
voyage
may
have
been
no
man
knows
he
may
have
foundered
in
that
gale
or
he
may
have
been
picked
up
by
some
canny
merchantman
who
stuck
to
the
bullion
and
kept
his
mouth
shut
or
he
may
still
be
cruising
in
that
vast
waste
of
waters
blown
north
to
the
behring
sea
or
south
to
the
malay
islands
itâ€™s
better
to
leave
it
unfinished
than
to
spoil
a
true
story
by
inventing
a
tag
to
itâ€
b
24
i
told
my
story
when
i
was
taken
and
no
one
would
listen
to
me
then
i
told
it
again
at
the
trialâ€”the
whole
thing
absolutely
as
it
happened
without
so
much
as
a
word
added
i
set
it
all
out
truly
so
help
me
god
all
that
lady
mannering
said
and
did
and
then
all
that
i
had
said
and
done
just
as
it
occurred
and
what
did
i
get
for
it
â€œthe
prisoner
put
forward
a
rambling
and
inconsequential
statement
incredible
in
its
details
and
unsupported
by
any
shred
of
corroborative
evidenceâ€
that
was
what
one
of
the
london
papers
said
and
others
let
it
pass
as
if
i
had
made
no
defence
at
all
and
yet
with
my
own
eyes
i
saw
lord
mannering
murdered
and
i
am
as
guiltless
of
it
as
any
man
on
the
jury
that
tried
me
now
sir
you
are
there
to
receive
the
petitions
of
prisoners
it
all
lies
with
you
all
i
ask
is
that
you
read
itâ€”just
read
itâ€”and
then
that
you
make
an
inquiry
or
two
about
the
private
character
of
this
â€œladyâ€
mannering
if
she
still
keeps
the
name
that
she
had
three
years
ago
when
to
my
sorrow
and
ruin
i
came
to
meet
her
you
could
use
a
private
inquiry
agent
or
a
good
lawyer
and
you
would
soon
learn
enough
to
show
you
that
my
story
is
the
true
one
think
of
the
glory
it
would
be
to
you
to
have
all
the
papers
saying
that
there
would
have
been
a
shocking
miscarriage
of
justice
if
it
had
not
been
for
your
perseverance
and
intelligence
that
must
be
your
reward
since
i
am
a
poor
man
and
can
offer
you
nothing
but
if
you
donâ€™t
do
it
may
you
never
lie
easy
in
your
bed
again
may
no
night
pass
that
you
are
not
haunted
by
the
thought
of
the
man
who
rots
in
gaol
because
you
have
not
done
the
duty
which
you
are
paid
to
do
but
you
will
do
it
sir
i
know
just
make
one
or
two
inquiries
and
you
will
soon
find
which
way
the
wind
blows
remember
also
that
the
only
person
who
profited
by
the
crime
was
herself
since
it
changed
her
from
an
unhappy
wife
to
a
rich
young
widow
thereâ€™s
the
end
of
the
string
in
your
hand
and
you
only
have
to
follow
it
up
and
see
where
it
leads
to
mind
you
sir
i
make
no
complaint
as
far
as
the
burglary
goes
i
donâ€™t
whine
about
what
i
have
deserved
and
so
far
i
have
had
no
more
than
i
have
deserved
burglary
it
was
right
enough
and
my
three
years
have
gone
to
pay
for
it
it
was
shown
at
the
trial
that
i
had
had
a
hand
in
the
merton
cross
business
and
did
a
year
for
that
so
my
story
had
the
less
attention
on
that
account
a
man
with
a
previous
conviction
never
gets
a
really
fair
trial
i
own
to
the
burglary
but
when
it
comes
to
the
murder
which
brought
me
a
liferâ€”any
judge
but
sir
james
might
have
given
me
the
gallowsâ€”then
i
tell
you
that
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
that
i
am
an
innocent
man
and
now
iâ€™ll
take
that
night
the
13th
of
september
1894
and
iâ€™ll
give
you
just
exactly
what
occurred
and
may
godâ€™s
hand
strike
me
down
if
i
go
one
inch
over
the
truth
i
had
been
at
bristol
in
the
summer
looking
for
work
and
then
i
had
a
notion
that
i
might
get
something
at
portsmouth
for
i
was
trained
as
a
skilled
mechanic
so
i
came
tramping
my
way
across
the
south
of
england
and
doing
odd
jobs
as
i
went
i
was
trying
all
i
knew
to
keep
off
the
cross
for
i
had
done
a
year
in
exeter
gaol
and
i
had
had
enough
of
visiting
queen
victoria
but
itâ€™s
cruel
hard
to
get
work
when
once
the
black
mark
is
against
your
name
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
soul
and
body
together
at
last
after
ten
days
of
wood-cutting
and
stone-breaking
on
starvation
pay
i
found
myself
near
salisbury
with
a
couple
of
shillings
in
my
pocket
and
my
boots
and
my
patience
clean
wore
out
thereâ€™s
an
ale-house
called
â€œthe
willing
mindâ€
which
stands
on
the
road
between
blandford
and
salisbury
and
it
was
there
that
night
i
engaged
a
bed
i
was
sitting
alone
in
the
tap-room
just
about
closing
time
when
the
innkeeperâ€”allen
his
name
wasâ€”came
beside
me
and
began
yarning
about
the
neighbours
he
was
a
man
that
liked
to
talk
and
to
have
some
one
to
listen
to
his
talk
so
i
sat
there
smoking
and
drinking
a
mug
of
ale
which
he
had
stood
me
and
i
took
no
great
interest
in
what
he
said
until
he
began
to
talk
as
the
devil
would
have
it
about
the
riches
of
mannering
hall
â€œmeaning
the
large
house
on
the
right
before
i
came
to
the
villageâ€
said
i
â€œthe
one
that
stands
in
its
own
parkâ€
â€œexactlyâ€
said
heâ€”and
i
am
giving
all
our
talk
so
that
you
may
know
that
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
and
hiding
nothing
â€œthe
long
white
house
with
the
pillarsâ€
said
he
â€œat
the
side
of
the
blandford
roadâ€
now
i
had
looked
at
it
as
i
passed
and
it
had
crossed
my
mind
as
such
thoughts
will
that
it
was
a
very
easy
house
to
get
into
with
that
great
row
of
ground
windows
and
glass
doors
i
had
put
the
thought
away
from
me
and
now
here
was
this
landlord
bringing
it
back
with
his
talk
about
the
riches
within
i
said
nothing
but
i
listened
and
as
luck
would
have
it
he
would
always
come
back
to
this
one
subject
â€œhe
was
a
miser
young
so
you
can
think
what
he
is
now
in
his
ageâ€
said
he
â€œwell
heâ€™s
had
some
good
out
of
his
moneyâ€
â€œwhat
good
can
he
have
had
if
he
does
not
spend
itâ€
said
i
â€œwell
it
bought
him
the
prettiest
wife
in
england
and
that
was
some
good
that
he
got
out
of
it
she
thought
she
would
have
the
spending
of
it
but
she
knows
the
difference
nowâ€
â€œwho
was
she
thenâ€
i
asked
just
for
the
sake
of
something
to
say
â€œshe
was
nobody
at
all
until
the
old
lord
made
her
his
ladyâ€
said
he
â€œshe
came
from
up
london
way
and
some
said
that
she
had
been
on
the
stage
there
but
nobody
knew
the
old
lord
was
away
for
a
year
and
when
he
came
home
he
brought
a
young
wife
back
with
him
and
there
she
has
been
ever
since
stephens
the
butler
did
tell
me
once
that
she
was
the
light
of
the
house
when
fust
she
came
but
what
with
her
husbandâ€™s
mean
and
aggravatinâ€™
way
and
what
with
her
lonelinessâ€”for
he
hates
to
see
a
visitor
within
his
doors
and
what
with
his
bitter
wordsâ€”for
he
has
a
tongue
like
a
hornetâ€™s
sting
her
life
all
went
out
of
her
and
she
became
a
white
silent
creature
moping
about
the
country
lanes
some
say
that
she
loved
another
man
and
that
it
was
just
the
riches
of
the
old
lord
which
tempted
her
to
be
false
to
her
lover
and
that
now
she
is
eating
her
heart
out
because
she
has
lost
the
one
without
being
any
nearer
to
the
other
for
she
might
be
the
poorest
woman
in
the
parish
for
all
the
money
that
she
has
the
handling
ofâ€
well
sir
you
can
imagine
that
it
did
not
interest
me
very
much
to
hear
about
the
quarrels
between
a
lord
and
a
lady
what
did
it
matter
to
me
if
she
hated
the
sound
of
his
voice
or
if
he
put
every
indignity
upon
her
in
the
hope
of
breaking
her
spirit
and
spoke
to
her
as
he
would
never
have
dared
to
speak
to
one
of
his
servants
the
landlord
told
me
of
these
things
and
of
many
more
like
them
but
they
passed
out
of
my
mind
for
they
were
no
concern
of
mine
but
what
i
did
want
to
hear
was
the
form
in
which
lord
mannering
kept
his
riches
title-deeds
and
stock
certificates
are
but
paper
and
more
danger
than
profit
to
the
man
who
takes
them
but
metal
and
stones
are
worth
a
risk
and
then
as
if
he
were
answering
my
very
thoughts
the
landlord
told
me
of
lord
manneringâ€™s
great
collection
of
gold
medals
that
it
was
the
most
valuable
in
the
world
and
that
it
was
reckoned
that
if
they
were
put
into
a
sack
the
strongest
man
in
the
parish
would
not
be
able
to
raise
them
then
his
wife
called
him
and
he
and
i
went
to
our
beds
i
am
not
arguing
to
make
out
a
case
for
myself
but
i
beg
you
sir
to
bear
all
the
facts
in
your
mind
and
to
ask
yourself
whether
a
man
could
be
more
sorely
tempted
than
i
was
i
make
bold
to
say
that
there
are
few
who
could
have
held
out
against
it
there
i
lay
on
my
bed
that
night
a
desperate
man
without
hope
or
work
and
with
my
last
shilling
in
my
pocket
i
had
tried
to
be
honest
and
honest
folk
had
turned
their
backs
upon
me
they
taunted
me
for
theft
and
yet
they
pushed
me
towards
it
i
was
caught
in
the
stream
and
could
not
get
out
and
then
it
was
such
a
chance
the
great
house
all
lined
with
windows
the
golden
medals
which
could
so
easily
be
melted
down
it
was
like
putting
a
loaf
before
a
starving
man
and
expecting
him
not
to
eat
it
i
fought
against
it
for
a
time
but
it
was
no
use
at
last
i
sat
up
on
the
side
of
my
bed
and
i
swore
that
that
night
i
should
either
be
a
rich
man
and
able
to
give
up
crime
for
ever
or
that
the
irons
should
be
on
my
wrists
once
more
then
i
slipped
on
my
clothes
and
having
put
a
shilling
on
the
tableâ€”for
the
landlord
had
treated
me
well
and
i
did
not
wish
to
cheat
himâ€”i
passed
out
through
the
window
into
the
garden
of
the
inn
there
was
a
high
wall
round
this
garden
and
i
had
a
job
to
get
over
it
but
once
on
the
other
side
it
was
all
plain
sailing
i
did
not
meet
a
soul
upon
the
road
and
the
iron
gate
of
the
avenue
was
open
no
one
was
moving
at
the
lodge
the
moon
was
shining
and
i
could
see
the
great
house
glimmering
white
through
an
archway
of
trees
i
walked
up
it
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
until
i
was
at
the
edge
of
the
drive
where
it
ended
in
a
broad
gravelled
space
before
the
main
door
there
i
stood
in
the
shadow
and
looked
at
the
long
building
with
a
full
moon
shining
in
every
window
and
silvering
the
high
stone
front
i
crouched
there
for
some
time
and
i
wondered
where
i
should
find
the
easiest
entrance
the
corner
window
of
the
side
seemed
to
be
the
one
which
was
least
overlooked
and
a
screen
of
ivy
hung
heavily
over
it
my
best
chance
was
evidently
there
i
worked
my
way
under
the
trees
to
the
back
of
the
house
and
then
crept
along
in
the
black
shadow
of
the
building
a
dog
barked
and
rattled
his
chain
but
i
stood
waiting
until
he
was
quiet
and
then
i
stole
on
once
more
until
i
came
to
the
window
which
i
had
chosen
it
is
astonishing
how
careless
they
are
in
the
country
in
places
far
removed
from
large
towns
where
the
thought
of
burglars
never
enters
their
heads
i
call
it
setting
temptation
in
a
poor
manâ€™s
way
when
he
puts
his
hand
meaning
no
harm
upon
a
door
and
finds
it
swing
open
before
him
in
this
case
it
was
not
so
bad
as
that
but
the
window
was
merely
fastened
with
the
ordinary
catch
which
i
opened
with
a
push
from
the
blade
of
my
knife
i
pulled
up
the
window
as
quickly
as
possible
and
then
i
thrust
the
knife
through
the
slit
in
the
shutter
and
prized
it
open
they
were
folding
shutters
and
i
shoved
them
before
me
and
walked
into
the
room
â€œgood
evening
sir
you
are
very
welcomeâ€
said
a
voice
iâ€™ve
had
some
starts
in
my
life
but
never
one
to
come
up
to
that
one
there
in
the
opening
of
the
shutters
within
reach
of
my
arm
was
standing
a
woman
with
a
small
coil
of
wax
taper
burning
in
her
hand
she
was
tall
and
straight
and
slender
with
a
beautiful
white
face
that
might
have
been
cut
out
of
clear
marble
but
her
hair
and
eyes
were
as
black
as
night
she
was
dressed
in
some
sort
of
white
dressing-gown
which
flowed
down
to
her
feet
and
what
with
this
robe
and
what
with
her
face
it
seemed
as
if
a
spirit
from
above
was
standing
in
front
of
me
my
knees
knocked
together
and
i
held
on
to
the
shutter
with
one
hand
to
give
me
support
i
should
have
turned
and
run
away
if
i
had
had
the
strength
but
i
could
only
just
stand
and
stare
at
her
she
soon
brought
me
back
to
myself
once
more
â€œdonâ€™t
be
frightenedâ€
said
she
and
they
were
strange
words
for
the
mistress
of
a
house
to
have
to
use
to
a
burglar
â€œi
saw
you
out
of
my
bedroom
window
when
you
were
hiding
under
those
trees
so
i
slipped
downstairs
and
then
i
heard
you
at
the
window
i
should
have
opened
it
for
you
if
you
had
waited
but
you
managed
it
yourself
just
as
i
came
upâ€
i
still
held
in
my
hand
the
long
clasp-knife
with
which
i
had
opened
the
shutter
i
was
unshaven
and
grimed
from
a
week
on
the
roads
altogether
there
are
few
people
who
would
have
cared
to
face
me
alone
at
one
in
the
morning
but
this
woman
if
i
had
been
her
lover
meeting
her
by
appointment
could
not
have
looked
upon
me
with
a
more
welcoming
eye
she
laid
her
hand
upon
my
sleeve
and
drew
me
into
the
room
â€œwhatâ€™s
the
meaning
of
this
maâ€™am
donâ€™t
get
trying
any
little
games
upon
meâ€
said
i
in
my
roughest
wayâ€”and
i
can
put
it
on
rough
when
i
like
â€œitâ€™ll
be
the
worse
for
you
if
you
play
me
any
trickâ€
i
added
showing
her
my
knife
â€œi
will
play
you
no
trickâ€
said
she
â€œon
the
contrary
i
am
your
friend
and
i
wish
to
help
youâ€
â€œexcuse
me
maâ€™am
but
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
thatâ€
said
i
â€œwhy
should
you
wish
to
help
meâ€
â€œi
have
my
own
reasonsâ€
said
she
and
then
suddenly
with
those
black
eyes
blazing
out
of
her
white
face
â€œitâ€™s
because
i
hate
him
hate
him
hate
him
now
you
understandâ€
i
remembered
what
the
landlord
had
told
me
and
i
did
understand
i
looked
at
her
ladyshipâ€™s
face
and
i
knew
that
i
could
trust
her
she
wanted
to
revenge
herself
upon
her
husband
she
wanted
to
hit
him
where
it
would
hurt
him
mostâ€”upon
the
pocket
she
hated
him
so
that
she
would
even
lower
her
pride
to
take
such
a
man
as
me
into
her
confidence
if
she
could
gain
her
end
by
doing
so
iâ€™ve
hated
some
folk
in
my
time
but
i
donâ€™t
think
i
ever
understood
what
hate
was
until
i
saw
that
womanâ€™s
face
in
the
light
of
the
taper
â€œyouâ€™ll
trust
me
nowâ€
said
she
with
another
coaxing
touch
upon
my
sleeve
â€œyes
your
ladyshipâ€
â€œyou
know
me
thenâ€
â€œi
can
guess
who
you
areâ€
â€œi
daresay
my
wrongs
are
the
talk
of
the
county
but
what
does
he
care
for
that
he
only
cares
for
one
thing
in
the
whole
world
and
that
you
can
take
from
him
this
night
have
you
a
bagâ€
â€œno
your
ladyshipâ€
â€œshut
the
shutter
behind
you
then
no
one
can
see
the
light
you
are
quite
safe
the
servants
all
sleep
in
the
other
wing
i
can
show
you
where
all
the
most
valuable
things
are
you
cannot
carry
them
all
so
we
must
pick
the
bestâ€
the
room
in
which
i
found
myself
was
long
and
low
with
many
rugs
and
skins
scattered
about
on
a
polished
wood
floor
small
cases
stood
here
and
there
and
the
walls
were
decorated
with
spears
and
swords
and
paddles
and
other
things
which
find
their
way
into
museums
there
were
some
queer
clothes
too
which
had
been
brought
from
savage
countries
and
the
lady
took
down
a
large
leather
sack-bag
from
among
them
â€œthis
sleeping-sack
will
doâ€
said
she
â€œnow
come
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
where
the
medals
areâ€
it
was
like
a
dream
to
me
to
think
that
this
tall
white
woman
was
the
lady
of
the
house
and
that
she
was
lending
me
a
hand
to
rob
her
own
home
i
could
have
burst
out
laughing
at
the
thought
of
it
and
yet
there
was
something
in
that
pale
face
of
hers
which
stopped
my
laughter
and
turned
me
cold
and
serious
she
swept
on
in
front
of
me
like
a
spirit
with
the
green
taper
in
her
hand
and
i
walked
behind
with
my
sack
until
we
came
to
a
door
at
the
end
of
this
museum
it
was
locked
but
the
key
was
in
it
and
she
led
me
through
the
room
beyond
was
a
small
one
hung
all
round
with
curtains
which
had
pictures
on
them
it
was
the
hunting
of
a
deer
that
was
painted
on
it
as
i
remember
and
in
the
flicker
of
that
light
youâ€™d
have
sworn
that
the
dogs
and
the
horses
were
streaming
round
the
walls
the
only
other
thing
in
the
room
was
a
row
of
cases
made
of
walnut
with
brass
ornaments
they
had
glass
tops
and
beneath
this
glass
i
saw
the
long
lines
of
those
gold
medals
some
of
them
as
big
as
a
plate
and
half
an
inch
thick
all
resting
upon
red
velvet
and
glowing
and
gleaming
in
the
darkness
my
fingers
were
just
itching
to
be
at
them
and
i
slipped
my
knife
under
the
lock
of
one
of
the
cases
to
wrench
it
open
â€œwait
a
momentâ€
said
she
laying
her
hand
upon
my
arm
â€œyou
might
do
better
than
thisâ€
â€œi
am
very
well
satisfied
maâ€™amâ€
said
i
â€œand
much
obliged
to
your
ladyship
for
kind
assistanceâ€
â€œyou
can
do
betterâ€
she
repeated
â€œwould
not
golden
sovereigns
be
worth
more
to
you
than
these
thingsâ€
â€œwhy
yesâ€
said
i
â€œthatâ€™s
best
of
allâ€
â€œwellâ€
said
she
â€œhe
sleeps
just
above
our
head
it
is
but
one
short
staircase
there
is
a
tin
box
with
money
enough
to
fill
this
bag
under
his
bedâ€
â€œhow
can
i
get
it
without
waking
himâ€
â€œwhat
matter
if
he
does
wakeâ€
she
looked
very
hard
at
me
as
she
spoke
â€œyou
could
keep
him
from
calling
outâ€
â€œno
no
maâ€™am
iâ€™ll
have
none
of
thatâ€
â€œjust
as
you
likeâ€
said
she
â€œi
thought
that
you
were
a
stout-hearted
sort
of
man
by
your
appearance
but
i
see
that
i
made
a
mistake
if
you
are
afraid
to
run
the
risk
of
one
old
man
then
of
course
you
cannot
have
the
gold
which
is
under
his
bed
you
are
the
best
judge
of
your
own
business
but
i
should
think
that
you
would
do
better
at
some
other
tradeâ€
â€œiâ€™ll
not
have
murder
on
my
conscienceâ€
â€œyou
could
overpower
him
without
harming
him
i
never
said
anything
of
murder
the
money
lies
under
the
bed
but
if
you
are
faint-hearted
it
is
better
that
you
should
not
attempt
itâ€
she
worked
upon
me
so
partly
with
her
scorn
and
partly
with
this
money
that
she
held
before
my
eyes
that
i
believe
i
should
have
yielded
and
taken
my
chances
upstairs
had
it
not
been
that
i
saw
her
eyes
following
the
struggle
within
me
in
such
a
crafty
malignant
fashion
that
it
was
evident
she
was
bent
upon
making
me
the
tool
of
her
revenge
and
that
she
would
leave
me
no
choice
but
to
do
the
old
man
an
injury
or
to
be
captured
by
him
she
felt
suddenly
that
she
was
giving
herself
away
and
she
changed
her
face
to
a
kindly
friendly
smile
but
it
was
too
late
for
i
had
had
my
warning
â€œi
will
not
go
upstairsâ€
said
i
â€œi
have
all
i
want
hereâ€
she
looked
her
contempt
at
me
and
there
never
was
a
face
which
could
look
it
plainer
â€œvery
good
you
can
take
these
medals
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
begin
at
this
end
i
suppose
they
will
all
be
the
same
value
when
melted
down
but
these
are
the
ones
which
are
the
rarest
and
therefore
the
most
precious
to
him
it
is
not
necessary
to
break
the
locks
if
you
press
that
brass
knob
you
will
find
that
there
is
a
secret
spring
so
take
that
small
one
firstâ€”it
is
the
very
apple
of
his
eyeâ€
she
had
opened
one
of
the
cases
and
the
beautiful
things
all
lay
exposed
before
me
i
had
my
hand
upon
the
one
which
she
had
pointed
out
when
suddenly
a
change
came
over
her
face
and
she
held
up
one
finger
as
a
warning
â€œhistâ€
she
whispered
â€œwhat
is
thatâ€
far
away
in
the
silence
of
the
house
we
heard
a
low
dragging
shuffling
sound
and
the
distant
tread
of
feet
she
closed
and
fastened
the
case
in
an
instant
â€œitâ€™s
my
husbandâ€
she
whispered
â€œall
right
donâ€™t
be
alarmed
iâ€™ll
arrange
it
here
quick
behind
the
tapestryâ€
she
pushed
me
behind
the
painted
curtains
upon
the
wall
my
empty
leather
bag
still
in
my
hand
then
she
took
her
taper
and
walked
quickly
into
the
room
from
which
we
had
come
from
where
i
stood
i
could
see
her
through
the
open
door
â€œis
that
you
robertâ€
she
cried
the
light
of
a
candle
shone
through
the
door
of
the
museum
and
the
shuffling
steps
came
nearer
and
nearer
then
i
saw
a
face
in
the
doorway
a
great
heavy
face
all
lines
and
creases
with
a
huge
curving
nose
and
a
pair
of
gold
glasses
fixed
across
it
he
had
to
throw
his
head
back
to
see
through
the
glasses
and
that
great
nose
thrust
out
in
front
of
him
like
the
beak
of
some
sort
of
fowl
he
was
a
big
man
very
tall
and
burly
so
that
in
his
loose
dressing-gown
his
figure
seemed
to
fill
up
the
whole
doorway
he
had
a
pile
of
grey
curling
hair
all
round
his
head
but
his
face
was
clean-shaven
his
mouth
was
thin
and
small
and
prim
hidden
away
under
his
long
masterful
nose
he
stood
there
holding
the
candle
in
front
of
him
and
looking
at
his
wife
with
a
queer
malicious
gleam
in
his
eyes
it
only
needed
that
one
look
to
tell
me
that
he
was
as
fond
of
her
as
she
was
of
him
â€œhowâ€™s
thisâ€
he
asked
â€œsome
new
tantrum
what
do
you
mean
by
wandering
about
the
house
why
donâ€™t
you
go
to
bedâ€
â€œi
could
not
sleepâ€
she
answered
she
spoke
languidly
and
wearily
if
she
was
an
actress
once
she
had
not
forgotten
her
calling
â€œmight
i
suggestâ€
said
he
in
the
same
mocking
kind
of
voice
â€œthat
a
good
conscience
is
an
excellent
aid
to
sleepâ€
â€œthat
cannot
be
trueâ€
she
answered
â€œfor
you
sleep
very
wellâ€
â€œi
have
only
one
thing
in
my
life
to
be
ashamed
ofâ€
said
he
and
his
hair
bristled
up
with
anger
until
he
looked
like
an
old
cockatoo
â€œyou
know
best
what
that
is
it
is
a
mistake
which
has
brought
its
own
punishment
with
itâ€
â€œto
me
as
well
as
to
you
remember
thatâ€
â€œyou
have
very
little
to
whine
about
it
was
i
who
stooped
and
you
who
roseâ€
â€œroseâ€
â€œyes
rose
i
suppose
you
do
not
deny
that
it
is
promotion
to
exchange
the
music-hall
for
mannering
hall
fool
that
i
was
ever
to
take
you
out
of
your
true
sphereâ€
â€œif
you
think
so
why
do
you
not
separateâ€
â€œbecause
private
misery
is
better
than
public
humiliation
because
it
is
easier
to
suffer
for
a
mistake
than
to
own
to
it
because
also
i
like
to
keep
you
in
my
sight
and
to
know
that
you
cannot
go
back
to
himâ€
â€œyou
villain
you
cowardly
villainâ€
â€œyes
yes
my
lady
i
know
your
secret
ambition
but
it
shall
never
be
while
i
live
and
if
it
happens
after
my
death
i
will
at
least
take
care
that
you
go
to
him
as
a
beggar
you
and
dear
edward
will
never
have
the
satisfaction
of
squandering
my
savings
and
you
may
make
up
your
mind
to
that
my
lady
why
are
those
shutters
and
the
window
openâ€
â€œi
found
the
night
very
closeâ€
â€œit
is
not
safe
how
do
you
know
that
some
tramp
may
not
be
outside
are
you
aware
that
my
collection
of
medals
is
worth
more
than
any
similar
collection
in
the
world
you
have
left
the
door
open
also
what
is
there
to
prevent
any
one
from
rifling
the
casesâ€
â€œi
was
hereâ€
â€œi
know
you
were
i
heard
you
moving
about
in
the
medal
room
and
that
was
why
i
came
down
what
were
you
doingâ€
â€œlooking
at
the
medals
what
else
should
i
be
doingâ€
â€œthis
curiosity
is
something
newâ€
he
looked
suspiciously
at
her
and
moved
on
towards
the
inner
room
she
walking
beside
him
it
was
at
this
moment
that
i
saw
something
which
startled
me
i
had
laid
my
clasp-knife
open
upon
the
top
of
one
of
the
cases
and
there
it
lay
in
full
view
she
saw
it
before
he
did
and
with
a
womanâ€™s
cunning
she
held
her
taper
out
so
that
the
light
of
it
came
between
lord
manneringâ€™s
eyes
and
the
knife
then
she
took
it
in
her
left
hand
and
held
it
against
her
gown
out
of
his
sight
he
looked
about
from
case
to
caseâ€”i
could
have
put
my
hand
at
one
time
upon
his
long
noseâ€”but
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
the
medals
had
been
tampered
with
and
so
still
snarling
and
grumbling
he
shuffled
off
into
the
other
room
once
more
and
now
i
have
to
speak
of
what
i
heard
rather
than
of
what
i
saw
but
i
swear
to
you
as
i
shall
stand
some
day
before
my
maker
that
what
i
say
is
the
truth
when
they
passed
into
the
outer
room
i
saw
him
lay
his
candle
upon
the
corner
of
one
of
the
tables
and
he
sat
himself
down
but
in
such
a
position
that
he
was
just
out
of
my
sight
she
moved
behind
him
as
i
could
tell
from
the
fact
that
the
light
of
her
taper
threw
his
long
lumpy
shadow
upon
the
floor
in
front
of
him
then
he
began
talking
about
this
man
whom
he
called
edward
and
every
word
that
he
said
was
like
a
blistering
drop
of
vitriol
he
spoke
low
so
that
i
could
not
hear
it
all
but
from
what
i
heard
i
should
guess
that
she
would
as
soon
have
been
lashed
with
a
whip
at
first
she
said
some
hot
words
in
reply
but
then
she
was
silent
and
he
went
on
and
on
in
that
cold
mocking
voice
of
his
nagging
and
insulting
and
tormenting
until
i
wondered
that
she
could
bear
to
stand
there
in
silence
and
listen
to
it
then
suddenly
i
heard
him
say
in
a
sharp
voice
â€œcome
from
behind
me
leave
go
of
my
collar
what
would
you
dare
to
strike
meâ€
there
was
a
sound
like
a
blow
just
a
soft
sort
of
thud
and
then
i
heard
him
cry
out
â€œmy
god
itâ€™s
bloodâ€
he
shuffled
with
his
feet
as
if
he
was
getting
up
and
then
i
heard
another
blow
and
he
cried
out
â€œoh
you
she-devilâ€
and
was
quiet
except
for
a
dripping
and
splashing
upon
the
floor
i
ran
out
from
behind
my
curtain
at
that
and
rushed
into
the
other
room
shaking
all
over
with
the
horror
of
it
the
old
man
had
slipped
down
in
the
chair
and
his
dressing-gown
had
rucked
up
until
he
looked
as
if
he
had
a
monstrous
hump
to
his
back
his
head
with
the
gold
glasses
still
fixed
on
his
nose
was
lolling
over
upon
one
side
and
his
little
mouth
was
open
just
like
a
dead
fish
i
could
not
see
where
the
blood
was
coming
from
but
i
could
still
hear
it
drumming
upon
the
floor
she
stood
behind
him
with
the
candle
shining
full
upon
her
face
her
lips
were
pressed
together
and
her
eyes
shining
and
a
touch
of
colour
had
come
into
each
of
her
cheeks
it
just
wanted
that
to
make
her
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
had
ever
seen
in
my
life
â€œyouâ€™ve
done
it
nowâ€
said
i
â€œyesâ€
said
she
in
her
quiet
way
â€œiâ€™ve
done
it
nowâ€
â€œwhat
are
you
going
to
doâ€
i
asked
â€œtheyâ€™ll
have
you
for
murder
as
sure
as
fateâ€
â€œnever
fear
about
me
i
have
nothing
to
live
for
and
it
does
not
matter
give
me
a
hand
to
set
him
straight
in
the
chair
it
is
horrible
to
see
him
like
thisâ€
i
did
so
though
it
turned
me
cold
all
over
to
touch
him
some
of
his
blood
came
on
my
hand
and
sickened
me
â€œnowâ€
said
she
â€œyou
may
as
well
have
the
medals
as
any
one
else
take
them
and
goâ€
â€œi
donâ€™t
want
them
i
only
want
to
get
away
i
was
never
mixed
up
with
a
business
like
this
beforeâ€
â€œnonsenseâ€
said
she
â€œyou
came
for
the
medals
and
here
they
are
at
your
mercy
why
should
you
not
have
them
there
is
no
one
to
prevent
youâ€
i
held
the
bag
still
in
my
hand
she
opened
the
case
and
between
us
we
threw
a
hundred
or
so
of
the
medals
into
it
they
were
all
from
the
one
case
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
wait
for
any
more
then
i
made
for
the
window
for
the
very
air
of
this
house
seemed
to
poison
me
after
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
as
i
looked
back
i
saw
her
standing
there
tall
and
graceful
with
the
light
in
her
hand
just
as
i
had
seen
her
first
she
waved
good-bye
and
i
waved
back
at
her
and
sprang
out
into
the
gravel
drive
i
thank
god
that
i
can
lay
my
hand
upon
my
heart
and
say
that
i
have
never
done
a
murder
but
perhaps
it
would
be
different
if
i
had
been
able
to
read
that
womanâ€™s
mind
and
thoughts
there
might
have
been
two
bodies
in
the
room
instead
of
one
if
i
could
have
seen
behind
that
last
smile
of
hers
but
i
thought
of
nothing
but
of
getting
safely
away
and
it
never
entered
my
head
how
she
might
be
fixing
the
rope
round
my
neck
i
had
not
taken
five
steps
out
from
the
window
skirting
down
the
shadow
of
the
house
in
the
way
that
i
had
come
when
i
heard
a
scream
that
might
have
raised
the
parish
and
then
another
and
another
â€œmurderâ€
she
cried
â€œmurder
murder
helpâ€
and
her
voice
rang
out
in
the
quiet
of
the
night-time
and
sounded
over
the
whole
country-side
it
went
through
my
head
that
dreadful
cry
in
an
instant
lights
began
to
move
and
windows
to
fly
up
not
only
in
the
house
behind
me
but
at
the
lodge
and
in
the
stables
in
front
like
a
frightened
rabbit
i
bolted
down
the
drive
but
i
heard
the
clang
of
the
gate
being
shut
before
i
could
reach
it
then
i
hid
my
bag
of
medals
under
some
dry
fagots
and
i
tried
to
get
away
across
the
park
but
some
one
saw
me
in
the
moonlight
and
presently
i
had
half
a
dozen
of
them
with
dogs
upon
my
heels
i
crouched
down
among
the
brambles
but
those
dogs
were
too
many
for
me
and
i
was
glad
enough
when
the
men
came
up
and
prevented
me
from
being
torn
into
pieces
they
seized
me
and
dragged
me
back
to
the
room
from
which
i
had
come
â€œis
this
the
man
your
ladyshipâ€
asked
the
oldest
of
themâ€”the
same
whom
i
found
out
afterwards
to
be
the
butler
she
had
been
bending
over
the
body
with
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
now
she
turned
upon
me
with
the
face
of
a
fury
oh
what
an
actress
that
woman
was
â€œyes
yes
it
is
the
very
manâ€
she
cried
â€œoh
you
villain
you
cruel
villain
to
treat
an
old
man
soâ€
there
was
a
man
there
who
seemed
to
be
a
village
constable
he
laid
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
â€œwhat
do
you
say
to
thatâ€
said
he
â€œit
was
she
who
did
itâ€
i
cried
pointing
at
the
woman
whose
eyes
never
flinched
before
mine
â€œcome
come
try
anotherâ€
said
the
constable
and
one
of
the
men-servants
struck
at
me
with
his
fist
â€œi
tell
you
that
i
saw
her
do
it
she
stabbed
him
twice
with
a
knife
she
first
helped
me
to
rob
him
and
then
she
murdered
himâ€
the
footman
tried
to
strike
me
again
but
she
held
up
her
hand
â€œdo
not
hurt
himâ€
said
she
â€œi
think
that
his
punishment
may
safely
be
left
to
the
lawâ€
â€œiâ€™ll
see
to
that
your
ladyshipâ€
said
the
constable
â€œyour
ladyship
actually
saw
the
crime
committed
did
you
notâ€
â€œyes
yes
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
it
was
horrible
we
heard
the
noise
and
we
came
down
my
poor
husband
was
in
front
the
man
had
one
of
the
cases
open
and
was
filling
a
black
leather
bag
which
he
held
in
his
hand
he
rushed
past
us
and
my
husband
seized
him
there
was
a
struggle
and
he
stabbed
him
twice
there
you
can
see
the
blood
upon
his
hands
if
i
am
not
mistaken
his
knife
is
still
in
lord
manneringâ€™s
bodyâ€
â€œlook
at
the
blood
upon
her
handsâ€
i
cried
â€œshe
has
been
holding
up
his
lordshipâ€™s
head
you
lying
rascalâ€
said
the
butler
â€œand
hereâ€™s
the
very
sack
her
ladyship
spoke
ofâ€
said
the
constable
as
a
groom
came
in
with
the
one
which
i
had
dropped
in
my
flight
â€œand
here
are
the
medals
inside
it
thatâ€™s
good
enough
for
me
we
will
keep
him
safe
here
to-night
and
to-morrow
the
inspector
and
i
can
take
him
into
salisburyâ€
â€œpoor
creatureâ€
said
the
woman
â€œfor
my
own
part
i
forgive
him
any
injury
which
he
has
done
me
who
knows
what
temptation
may
have
driven
him
to
crime
his
conscience
and
the
law
will
give
him
punishment
enough
without
any
reproach
of
mine
rendering
it
more
bitterâ€
i
could
not
answerâ€”i
tell
you
sir
i
could
not
answer
so
taken
aback
was
i
by
the
assurance
of
the
woman
and
so
seeming
by
my
silence
to
agree
to
all
that
she
had
said
i
was
dragged
away
by
the
butler
and
the
constable
into
the
cellar
in
which
they
locked
me
for
the
night
there
sir
i
have
told
you
the
whole
story
of
the
