upon
a
paper
attached
to
the
narrative
which
follows
doctor
hesselius
has
written
a
rather
elaborate
note
which
he
accompanies
with
a
reference
to
his
essay
on
the
strange
subject
which
the
ms
illuminates
this
mysterious
subject
he
treats
in
that
essay
with
his
usual
learning
and
acumen
and
with
remarkable
directness
and
condensation
it
will
form
but
one
volume
of
the
series
of
that
extraordinary
man's
collected
papers
as
i
publish
the
case
in
this
volume
simply
to
interest
the
laity
i
shall
forestall
the
intelligent
lady
who
relates
it
in
nothing
and
after
due
consideration
i
have
determined
therefore
to
abstain
from
presenting
any
prã©cis
of
the
learned
doctor's
reasoning
or
extract
from
his
statement
on
a
subject
which
he
describes
as
involving
not
improbably
some
of
the
profoundest
arcana
of
our
dual
existence
and
its
intermediates
i
was
anxious
on
discovering
this
paper
to
reopen
the
correspondence
commenced
by
doctor
hesselius
so
many
years
before
with
a
person
so
clever
and
careful
as
his
informant
seems
to
have
been
much
to
my
regret
however
i
found
that
she
had
died
in
the
interval
she
probably
could
have
added
little
to
the
narrative
which
she
communicates
in
the
following
pages
with
so
far
as
i
can
pronounce
such
conscientious
particularity
i
an
early
fright
in
styria
we
though
by
no
means
magnificent
people
inhabit
a
castle
or
schloss
a
small
income
in
that
part
of
the
world
goes
a
great
way
eight
or
nine
hundred
a
year

wonders
scantily
enough
ours
would
have
answered
among
wealthy
people
at
home
my
father
is
english
and
i
bear
an
english
name
although
i
never
saw
england
but
here
in
this
lonely
and
primitive
place
where
everything
is
so
marvelously
cheap
i
really
don't
see
how
ever
so
much
more
money
would
at
all
materially
add
to
our
comforts
or
even
luxuries
my
father
was
in
the
austrian
service
and
retired
upon
a
pension
and
his
patrimony
and
purchased
this
feudal
residence
and
the
small
estate
on
which
it
stands
a
bargain
nothing
can
be
more
picturesque
or
solitary
it
stands
on
a
slight
eminence
in
a
forest
the
road
very
old
and
narrow
passes
in
front
of
its
drawbridge
never
raised
in
my
time
and
its
moat
stocked
with
perch
and
sailed
over
by
many
swans
and
floating
on
its
surface
white
fleets
of
water
lilies
over
all
this
the
schloss
shows
its
many-windowed
front
its
towers
and
its
gothic
chapel
the
forest
opens
in
an
irregular
and
very
picturesque
glade
before
its
gate
and
at
the
right
a
steep
gothic
bridge
carries
the
road
over
a
stream
that
winds
in
deep
shadow
through
the
wood
i
have
said
that
this
is
a
very
lonely
place
judge
whether
i
say
truth
looking
from
the
hall
door
towards
the
road
the
forest
in
which
our
castle
stands
extends
fifteen
miles
to
the
right
and
twelve
to
the
left
the
nearest
inhabited
village
is
about
seven
of
your
english
miles
to
the
left
the
nearest
inhabited
schloss
of
any
historic
associations
is
that
of
old
general
spielsdorf
nearly
twenty
miles
away
to
the
right
i
have
said
the
nearest
inhabited
village
because
there
is
only
three
miles
westward
that
is
to
say
in
the
direction
of
general
spielsdorf's
schloss
a
ruined
village
with
its
quaint
little
church
now
roofless
in
the
aisle
of
which
are
the
moldering
tombs
of
the
proud
family
of
karnstein
now
extinct
who
once
owned
the
equally
desolate
chateau
which
in
the
thick
of
the
forest
overlooks
the
silent
ruins
of
the
town
respecting
the
cause
of
the
desertion
of
this
striking
and
melancholy
spot
there
is
a
legend
which
i
shall
relate
to
you
another
time
i
must
tell
you
now
how
very
small
is
the
party
who
constitute
the
inhabitants
of
our
castle
i
don't
include
servants
or
those
dependents
who
occupy
rooms
in
the
buildings
attached
to
the
schloss
listen
and
wonder
my
father
who
is
the
kindest
man
on
earth
but
growing
old
and
i
at
the
date
of
my
story
only
nineteen
eight
years
have
passed
since
then
i
and
my
father
constituted
the
family
at
the
schloss
my
mother
a
styrian
lady
died
in
my
infancy
but
i
had
a
good-natured
governess
who
had
been
with
me
from
i
might
almost
say
my
infancy
i
could
not
remember
the
time
when
her
fat
benignant
face
was
not
a
familiar
picture
in
my
memory
this
was
madame
perrodon
a
native
of
berne
whose
care
and
good
nature
now
in
part
supplied
to
me
the
loss
of
my
mother
whom
i
do
not
even
remember
so
early
i
lost
her
she
made
a
third
at
our
little
dinner
party
there
was
a
fourth
mademoiselle
de
lafontaine
a
lady
such
as
you
term
i
believe
a
finishing
governess
she
spoke
french
and
german
madame
perrodon
french
and
broken
english
to
which
my
father
and
i
added
english
which
partly
to
prevent
its
becoming
a
lost
language
among
us
and
partly
from
patriotic
motives
we
spoke
every
day
the
consequence
was
a
babel
at
which
strangers
used
to
laugh
and
which
i
shall
make
no
attempt
to
reproduce
in
this
narrative
and
there
were
two
or
three
young
lady
friends
besides
pretty
nearly
of
my
own
age
who
were
occasional
visitors
for
longer
or
shorter
terms
and
these
visits
i
sometimes
returned
these
were
our
regular
social
resources
but
of
course
there
were
chance
visits
from
neighbors
of
only
five
or
six
leagues
distance
my
life
was
notwithstanding
rather
a
solitary
one
i
can
assure
you
my
gouvernantes
had
just
so
much
control
over
me
as
you
might
conjecture
such
sage
persons
would
have
in
the
case
of
a
rather
spoiled
girl
whose
only
parent
allowed
her
pretty
nearly
her
own
way
in
everything
the
first
occurrence
in
my
existence
which
produced
a
terrible
impression
upon
my
mind
which
in
fact
never
has
been
effaced
was
one
of
the
very
earliest
incidents
of
my
life
which
i
can
recollect
some
people
will
think
it
so
trifling
that
it
should
not
be
recorded
here
you
will
see
however
by-and-by
why
i
mention
it
the
nursery
as
it
was
called
though
i
had
it
all
to
myself
was
a
large
room
in
the
upper
story
of
the
castle
with
a
steep
oak
roof
i
can't
have
been
more
than
six
years
old
when
one
night
i
awoke
and
looking
round
the
room
from
my
bed
failed
to
see
the
nursery
maid
neither
was
my
nurse
there
and
i
thought
myself
alone
i
was
not
frightened
for
i
was
one
of
those
happy
children
who
are
studiously
kept
in
ignorance
of
ghost
stories
of
fairy
tales
and
of
all
such
lore
as
makes
us
cover
up
our
heads
when
the
door
cracks
suddenly
or
the
flicker
of
an
expiring
candle
makes
the
shadow
of
a
bedpost
dance
upon
the
wall
nearer
to
our
faces
i
was
vexed
and
insulted
at
finding
myself
as
i
conceived
neglected
and
i
began
to
whimper
preparatory
to
a
hearty
bout
of
roaring
when
to
my
surprise
i
saw
a
solemn
but
very
pretty
face
looking
at
me
from
the
side
of
the
bed
it
was
that
of
a
young
lady
who
was
kneeling
with
her
hands
under
the
coverlet
i
looked
at
her
with
a
kind
of
pleased
wonder
and
ceased
whimpering
she
caressed
me
with
her
hands
and
lay
down
beside
me
on
the
bed
and
drew
me
towards
her
smiling
i
felt
immediately
delightfully
soothed
and
fell
asleep
again
i
was
wakened
by
a
sensation
as
if
two
needles
ran
into
my
breast
very
deep
at
the
same
moment
and
i
cried
loudly
the
lady
started
back
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
me
and
then
slipped
down
upon
the
floor
and
as
i
thought
hid
herself
under
the
bed
i
was
now
for
the
first
time
frightened
and
i
yelled
with
all
my
might
and
main
nurse
nursery
maid
housekeeper
all
came
running
in
and
hearing
my
story
they
made
light
of
it
soothing
me
all
they
could
meanwhile
but
child
as
i
was
i
could
perceive
that
their
faces
were
pale
with
an
unwonted
look
of
anxiety
and
i
saw
them
look
under
the
bed
and
about
the
room
and
peep
under
tables
and
pluck
open
cupboards
and
the
housekeeper
whispered
to
the
nurse
lay
your
hand
along
that
hollow
in
the
bed
someone
did
lie
there
so
sure
as
you
did
not
the
place
is
still
warm
i
remember
the
nursery
maid
petting
me
and
all
three
examining
my
chest
where
i
told
them
i
felt
the
puncture
and
pronouncing
that
there
was
no
sign
visible
that
any
such
thing
had
happened
to
me
the
housekeeper
and
the
two
other
servants
who
were
in
charge
of
the
nursery
remained
sitting
up
all
night
and
from
that
time
a
servant
always
sat
up
in
the
nursery
until
i
was
about
fourteen
i
was
very
nervous
for
a
long
time
after
this
a
doctor
was
called
in
he
was
pallid
and
elderly
how
well
i
remember
his
long
saturnine
face
slightly
pitted
with
smallpox
and
his
chestnut
wig
for
a
good
while
every
second
day
he
came
and
gave
me
medicine
which
of
course
i
hated
the
morning
after
i
saw
this
apparition
i
was
in
a
state
of
terror
and
could
not
bear
to
be
left
alone
daylight
though
it
was
for
a
moment
i
remember
my
father
coming
up
and
standing
at
the
bedside
and
talking
cheerfully
and
asking
the
nurse
a
number
of
questions
and
laughing
very
heartily
at
one
of
the
answers
and
patting
me
on
the
shoulder
and
kissing
me
and
telling
me
not
to
be
frightened
that
it
was
nothing
but
a
dream
and
could
not
hurt
me
but
i
was
not
comforted
for
i
knew
the
visit
of
the
strange
woman
was
not
a
dream
and
i
was
awfully
frightened
i
was
a
little
consoled
by
the
nursery
maid's
assuring
me
that
it
was
she
who
had
come
and
looked
at
me
and
lain
down
beside
me
in
the
bed
and
that
i
must
have
been
half-dreaming
not
to
have
known
her
face
but
this
though
supported
by
the
nurse
did
not
quite
satisfy
me
i
remembered
in
the
course
of
that
day
a
venerable
old
man
in
a
black
cassock
coming
into
the
room
with
the
nurse
and
housekeeper
and
talking
a
little
to
them
and
very
kindly
to
me
his
face
was
very
sweet
and
gentle
and
he
told
me
they
were
going
to
pray
and
joined
my
hands
together
and
desired
me
to
say
softly
while
they
were
praying
lord
hear
all
good
prayers
for
us
for
jesus'
sake
i
think
these
were
the
very
words
for
i
often
repeated
them
to
myself
and
my
nurse
used
for
years
to
make
me
say
them
in
my
prayers
i
remembered
so
well
the
thoughtful
sweet
face
of
that
white-haired
old
man
in
his
black
cassock
as
he
stood
in
that
rude
lofty
brown
room
with
the
clumsy
furniture
of
a
fashion
three
hundred
years
old
about
him
and
the
scanty
light
entering
its
shadowy
atmosphere
through
the
small
lattice
he
kneeled
and
the
three
women
with
him
and
he
prayed
aloud
with
an
earnest
quavering
voice
for
what
appeared
to
me
a
long
time
i
forget
all
my
life
preceding
that
event
and
for
some
time
after
it
is
all
obscure
also
but
the
scenes
i
have
just
described
stand
out
vivid
as
the
isolated
pictures
of
the
phantasmagoria
surrounded
by
darkness
ii
a
guest
i
am
now
going
to
tell
you
something
so
strange
that
it
will
require
all
your
faith
in
my
veracity
to
believe
my
story
it
is
not
only
true
nevertheless
but
truth
of
which
i
have
been
an
eyewitness
it
was
a
sweet
summer
evening
and
my
father
asked
me
as
he
sometimes
did
to
take
a
little
ramble
with
him
along
that
beautiful
forest
vista
which
i
have
mentioned
as
lying
in
front
of
the
schloss
general
spielsdorf
cannot
come
to
us
so
soon
as
i
had
hoped
said
my
father
as
we
pursued
our
walk
he
was
to
have
paid
us
a
visit
of
some
weeks
and
we
had
expected
his
arrival
next
day
he
was
to
have
brought
with
him
a
young
lady
his
niece
and
ward
mademoiselle
rheinfeldt
whom
i
had
never
seen
but
whom
i
had
heard
described
as
a
very
charming
girl
and
in
whose
society
i
had
promised
myself
many
happy
days
i
was
more
disappointed
than
a
young
lady
living
in
a
town
or
a
bustling
neighborhood
can
possibly
imagine
this
visit
and
the
new
acquaintance
it
promised
had
furnished
my
day
dream
for
many
weeks
and
how
soon
does
he
come
i
asked
not
till
autumn
not
for
two
months
i
dare
say
he
answered
and
i
am
very
glad
now
dear
that
you
never
knew
mademoiselle
rheinfeldt
and
why
i
asked
both
mortified
and
curious
because
the
poor
young
lady
is
dead
he
replied
i
quite
forgot
i
had
not
told
you
but
you
were
not
in
the
room
when
i
received
the
general's
letter
this
evening
i
was
very
much
shocked
general
spielsdorf
had
mentioned
in
his
first
letter
six
or
seven
weeks
before
that
she
was
not
so
well
as
he
would
wish
her
but
there
was
nothing
to
suggest
the
remotest
suspicion
of
danger
here
is
the
general's
letter
he
said
handing
it
to
me
i
am
afraid
he
is
in
great
affliction
the
letter
appears
to
me
to
have
been
written
very
nearly
in
distraction
we
sat
down
on
a
rude
bench
under
a
group
of
magnificent
lime
trees
the
sun
was
setting
with
all
its
melancholy
splendor
behind
the
sylvan
horizon
and
the
stream
that
flows
beside
our
home
and
passes
under
the
steep
old
bridge
i
have
mentioned
wound
through
many
a
group
of
noble
trees
almost
at
our
feet
reflecting
in
its
current
the
fading
crimson
of
the
sky
general
spielsdorf's
letter
was
so
extraordinary
so
vehement
and
in
some
places
so
self-contradictory
that
i
read
it
twice
over--the
second
time
aloud
to
my
father--and
was
still
unable
to
account
for
it
except
by
supposing
that
grief
had
unsettled
his
mind
it
said
i
have
lost
my
darling
daughter
for
as
such
i
loved
her
during
the
last
days
of
dear
bertha's
illness
i
was
not
able
to
write
to
you
before
then
i
had
no
idea
of
her
danger
i
have
lost
her
and
now
learn
all
too
late
she
died
in
the
peace
of
innocence
and
in
the
glorious
hope
of
a
blessed
futurity
the
fiend
who
betrayed
our
infatuated
hospitality
has
done
it
all
i
thought
i
was
receiving
into
my
house
innocence
gaiety
a
charming
companion
for
my
lost
bertha
heavens
what
a
fool
have
i
been
i
thank
god
my
child
died
without
a
suspicion
of
the
cause
of
her
sufferings
she
is
gone
without
so
much
as
conjecturing
the
nature
of
her
illness
and
the
accursed
passion
of
the
agent
of
all
this
misery
i
devote
my
remaining
days
to
tracking
and
extinguishing
a
monster
i
am
told
i
may
hope
to
accomplish
my
righteous
and
merciful
purpose
at
present
there
is
scarcely
a
gleam
of
light
to
guide
me
i
curse
my
conceited
incredulity
my
despicable
affectation
of
superiority
my
blindness
my
obstinacy--all--too
late
i
cannot
write
or
talk
collectedly
now
i
am
distracted
so
soon
as
i
shall
have
a
little
recovered
i
mean
to
devote
myself
for
a
time
to
enquiry
which
may
possibly
lead
me
as
far
as
vienna
some
time
in
the
autumn
two
months
hence
or
earlier
if
i
live
i
will
see
you--that
is
if
you
permit
me
i
will
then
tell
you
all
that
i
scarce
dare
put
upon
paper
now
farewell
pray
for
me
dear
friend
in
these
terms
ended
this
strange
letter
though
i
had
never
seen
bertha
rheinfeldt
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
at
the
sudden
intelligence
i
was
startled
as
well
as
profoundly
disappointed
the
sun
had
now
set
and
it
was
twilight
by
the
time
i
had
returned
the
general's
letter
to
my
father
it
was
a
soft
clear
evening
and
we
loitered
speculating
upon
the
possible
meanings
of
the
violent
and
incoherent
sentences
which
i
had
just
been
reading
we
had
nearly
a
mile
to
walk
before
reaching
the
road
that
passes
the
schloss
in
front
and
by
that
time
the
moon
was
shining
brilliantly
at
the
drawbridge
we
met
madame
perrodon
and
mademoiselle
de
lafontaine
who
had
come
out
without
their
bonnets
to
enjoy
the
exquisite
moonlight
we
heard
their
voices
gabbling
in
animated
dialogue
as
we
approached
we
joined
them
at
the
drawbridge
and
turned
about
to
admire
with
them
the
beautiful
scene
the
glade
through
which
we
had
just
walked
lay
before
us
at
our
left
the
narrow
road
wound
away
under
clumps
of
lordly
trees
and
was
lost
to
sight
amid
the
thickening
forest
at
the
right
the
same
road
crosses
the
steep
and
picturesque
bridge
near
which
stands
a
ruined
tower
which
once
guarded
that
pass
and
beyond
the
bridge
an
abrupt
eminence
rises
covered
with
trees
and
showing
in
the
shadows
some
grey
ivy-clustered
rocks
over
the
sward
and
low
grounds
a
thin
film
of
mist
was
stealing
like
smoke
marking
the
distances
with
a
transparent
veil
and
here
and
there
we
could
see
the
river
faintly
flashing
in
the
moonlight
no
softer
sweeter
scene
could
be
imagined
the
news
i
had
just
heard
made
it
melancholy
but
nothing
could
disturb
its
character
of
profound
serenity
and
the
enchanted
glory
and
vagueness
of
the
prospect
my
father
who
enjoyed
the
picturesque
and
i
stood
looking
in
silence
over
the
expanse
beneath
us
the
two
good
governesses
standing
a
little
way
behind
us
discoursed
upon
the
scene
and
were
eloquent
upon
the
moon
madame
perrodon
was
fat
middle-aged
and
romantic
and
talked
and
sighed
poetically
mademoiselle
de
lafontaine--in
right
of
her
father
who
was
a
german
assumed
to
be
psychological
metaphysical
and
something
of
a
mystic--now
declared
that
when
the
moon
shone
with
a
light
so
intense
it
was
well
known
that
it
indicated
a
special
spiritual
activity
the
effect
of
the
full
moon
in
such
a
state
of
brilliancy
was
manifold
it
acted
on
dreams
it
acted
on
lunacy
it
acted
on
nervous
people
it
had
marvelous
physical
influences
connected
with
life
mademoiselle
related
that
her
cousin
who
was
mate
of
a
merchant
ship
having
taken
a
nap
on
deck
on
such
a
night
lying
on
his
back
with
his
face
full
in
the
light
on
the
moon
had
wakened
after
a
dream
of
an
old
woman
clawing
him
by
the
cheek
with
his
features
horribly
drawn
to
one
side
and
his
countenance
had
never
quite
recovered
its
equilibrium
the
moon
this
night
she
said
is
full
of
idyllic
and
magnetic
influence--and
see
when
you
look
behind
you
at
the
front
of
the
schloss
how
all
its
windows
flash
and
twinkle
with
that
silvery
splendor
as
if
unseen
hands
had
lighted
up
the
rooms
to
receive
fairy
guests
there
are
indolent
styles
of
the
spirits
in
which
indisposed
to
talk
ourselves
the
talk
of
others
is
pleasant
to
our
listless
ears
and
i
gazed
on
pleased
with
the
tinkle
of
the
ladies'
conversation
i
have
got
into
one
of
my
moping
moods
tonight
said
my
father
after
a
silence
and
quoting
shakespeare
whom
by
way
of
keeping
up
our
english
he
used
to
read
aloud
he
said
'in
truth
i
know
not
why
i
am
so
sad
it
wearies
me
you
say
it
wearies
you
but
how
i
got
it--came
by
it'
i
forget
the
rest
but
i
feel
as
if
some
great
misfortune
were
hanging
over
us
i
suppose
the
poor
general's
afflicted
letter
has
had
something
to
do
with
it
at
this
moment
the
unwonted
sound
of
carriage
wheels
and
many
hoofs
upon
the
road
arrested
our
attention
they
seemed
to
be
approaching
from
the
high
ground
overlooking
the
bridge
and
very
soon
the
equipage
emerged
from
that
point
two
horsemen
first
crossed
the
bridge
then
came
a
carriage
drawn
by
four
horses
and
two
men
rode
behind
it
seemed
to
be
the
traveling
carriage
of
a
person
of
rank
and
we
were
all
immediately
absorbed
in
watching
that
very
unusual
spectacle
it
became
in
a
few
moments
greatly
more
interesting
for
just
as
the
carriage
had
passed
the
summit
of
the
steep
bridge
one
of
the
leaders
taking
fright
communicated
his
panic
to
the
rest
and
after
a
plunge
or
two
the
whole
team
broke
into
a
wild
gallop
together
and
dashing
between
the
horsemen
who
rode
in
front
came
thundering
along
the
road
towards
us
with
the
speed
of
a
hurricane
the
excitement
of
the
scene
was
made
more
painful
by
the
clear
long-drawn
screams
of
a
female
voice
from
the
carriage
window
we
all
advanced
in
curiosity
and
horror
me
rather
in
silence
the
rest
with
various
ejaculations
of
terror
our
suspense
did
not
last
long
just
before
you
reach
the
castle
drawbridge
on
the
route
they
were
coming
there
stands
by
the
roadside
a
magnificent
lime
tree
on
the
other
stands
an
ancient
stone
cross
at
sight
of
which
the
horses
now
going
at
a
pace
that
was
perfectly
frightful
swerved
so
as
to
bring
the
wheel
over
the
projecting
roots
of
the
tree
i
knew
what
was
coming
i
covered
my
eyes
unable
to
see
it
out
and
turned
my
head
away
at
the
same
moment
i
heard
a
cry
from
my
lady
friends
who
had
gone
on
a
little
curiosity
opened
my
eyes
and
i
saw
a
scene
of
utter
confusion
two
of
the
horses
were
on
the
ground
the
carriage
lay
upon
its
side
with
two
wheels
in
the
air
the
men
were
busy
removing
the
traces
and
a
lady
with
a
commanding
air
and
figure
had
got
out
and
stood
with
clasped
hands
raising
the
handkerchief
that
was
in
them
every
now
and
then
to
her
eyes
through
the
carriage
door
was
now
lifted
a
young
lady
who
appeared
to
be
lifeless
my
dear
old
father
was
already
beside
the
elder
lady
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
evidently
tendering
his
aid
and
the
resources
of
his
schloss
the
lady
did
not
appear
to
hear
him
or
to
have
eyes
for
anything
but
the
slender
girl
who
was
being
placed
against
the
slope
of
the
bank
i
approached
the
young
lady
was
apparently
stunned
but
she
was
certainly
not
dead
my
father
who
piqued
himself
on
being
something
of
a
physician
had
just
had
his
fingers
on
her
wrist
and
assured
the
lady
who
declared
herself
her
mother
that
her
pulse
though
faint
and
irregular
was
undoubtedly
still
distinguishable
the
lady
clasped
her
hands
and
looked
upward
as
if
in
a
momentary
transport
of
gratitude
but
immediately
she
broke
out
again
in
that
theatrical
way
which
is
i
believe
natural
to
some
people
she
was
what
is
called
a
fine
looking
woman
for
her
time
of
life
and
must
have
been
handsome
she
was
tall
but
not
thin
and
dressed
in
black
velvet
and
looked
rather
pale
but
with
a
proud
and
commanding
countenance
though
now
agitated
strangely
who
was
ever
being
so
born
to
calamity
i
heard
her
say
with
clasped
hands
as
i
came
up
here
am
i
on
a
journey
of
life
and
death
in
prosecuting
which
to
lose
an
hour
is
possibly
to
lose
all
my
child
will
not
have
recovered
sufficiently
to
resume
her
route
for
who
can
say
how
long
i
must
leave
her
i
cannot
dare
not
delay
how
far
on
sir
can
you
tell
is
the
nearest
village
i
must
leave
her
there
and
shall
not
see
my
darling
or
even
hear
of
her
till
my
return
three
months
hence
i
plucked
my
father
by
the
coat
and
whispered
earnestly
in
his
ear
oh
papa
pray
ask
her
to
let
her
stay
with
us--it
would
be
so
delightful
do
pray
if
madame
will
entrust
her
child
to
the
care
of
my
daughter
and
of
her
good
gouvernante
madame
perrodon
and
permit
her
to
remain
as
our
guest
under
my
charge
until
her
return
it
will
confer
a
distinction
and
an
obligation
upon
us
and
we
shall
treat
her
with
all
the
care
and
devotion
which
so
sacred
a
trust
deserves
i
cannot
do
that
sir
it
would
be
to
task
your
kindness
and
chivalry
too
cruelly
said
the
lady
distractedly
it
would
on
the
contrary
be
to
confer
on
us
a
very
great
kindness
at
the
moment
when
we
most
need
it
my
daughter
has
just
been
disappointed
by
a
cruel
misfortune
in
a
visit
from
which
she
had
long
anticipated
a
great
deal
of
happiness
if
you
confide
this
young
lady
to
our
care
it
will
be
her
best
consolation
the
nearest
village
on
your
route
is
distant
and
affords
no
such
inn
as
you
could
think
of
placing
your
daughter
at
you
cannot
allow
her
to
continue
her
journey
for
any
considerable
distance
without
danger
if
as
you
say
you
cannot
suspend
your
journey
you
must
part
with
her
tonight
and
nowhere
could
you
do
so
with
more
honest
assurances
of
care
and
tenderness
than
here
there
was
something
in
this
lady's
air
and
appearance
so
distinguished
and
even
imposing
and
in
her
manner
so
engaging
as
to
impress
one
quite
apart
from
the
dignity
of
her
equipage
with
a
conviction
that
she
was
a
person
of
consequence
by
this
time
the
carriage
was
replaced
in
its
upright
position
and
the
horses
quite
tractable
in
the
traces
again
the
lady
threw
on
her
daughter
a
glance
which
i
fancied
was
not
quite
so
affectionate
as
one
might
have
anticipated
from
the
beginning
of
the
scene
then
she
beckoned
slightly
to
my
father
and
withdrew
two
or
three
steps
with
him
out
of
hearing
and
talked
to
him
with
a
fixed
and
stern
countenance
not
at
all
like
that
with
which
she
had
hitherto
spoken
i
was
filled
with
wonder
that
my
father
did
not
seem
to
perceive
the
change
and
also
unspeakably
curious
to
learn
what
it
could
be
that
she
was
speaking
almost
in
his
ear
with
so
much
earnestness
and
rapidity
two
or
three
minutes
at
most
i
think
she
remained
thus
employed
then
she
turned
and
a
few
steps
brought
her
to
where
her
daughter
lay
supported
by
madame
perrodon
she
kneeled
beside
her
for
a
moment
and
whispered
as
madame
supposed
a
little
benediction
in
her
ear
then
hastily
kissing
her
she
stepped
into
her
carriage
the
door
was
closed
the
footmen
in
stately
liveries
jumped
up
behind
the
outriders
spurred
on
the
postilions
cracked
their
whips
the
horses
plunged
and
broke
suddenly
into
a
furious
canter
that
threatened
soon
again
to
become
a
gallop
and
the
carriage
whirled
away
followed
at
the
same
rapid
pace
by
the
two
horsemen
in
the
rear
iii
we
compare
notes
we
followed
the
cortege
with
our
eyes
until
it
was
swiftly
lost
to
sight
in
the
misty
wood
and
the
very
sound
of
the
hoofs
and
the
wheels
died
away
in
the
silent
night
air
nothing
remained
to
assure
us
that
the
adventure
had
not
been
an
illusion
of
a
moment
but
the
young
lady
who
just
at
that
moment
opened
her
eyes
i
could
not
see
for
her
face
was
turned
from
me
but
she
raised
her
head
evidently
looking
about
her
and
i
heard
a
very
sweet
voice
ask
complainingly
where
is
mamma
our
good
madame
perrodon
answered
tenderly
and
added
some
comfortable
assurances
i
then
heard
her
ask
where
am
i
what
is
this
place
and
after
that
she
said
i
don't
see
the
carriage
and
matska
where
is
she
madame
answered
all
her
questions
in
so
far
as
she
understood
them
and
gradually
the
young
lady
remembered
how
the
misadventure
came
about
and
was
glad
to
hear
that
no
one
in
or
in
attendance
on
the
carriage
was
hurt
and
on
learning
that
her
mamma
had
left
her
here
till
her
return
in
about
three
months
she
wept
i
was
going
to
add
my
consolations
to
those
of
madame
perrodon
when
mademoiselle
de
lafontaine
placed
her
hand
upon
my
arm
saying
don't
approach
one
at
a
time
is
as
much
as
she
can
at
present
converse
with
a
very
little
excitement
would
possibly
overpower
her
now
as
soon
as
she
is
comfortably
in
bed
i
thought
i
will
run
up
to
her
room
and
see
her
my
father
in
the
meantime
had
sent
a
servant
on
horseback
for
the
physician
who
lived
about
two
leagues
away
and
a
bedroom
was
being
prepared
for
the
young
lady's
reception
the
stranger
now
rose
and
leaning
on
madame's
arm
walked
slowly
over
the
drawbridge
and
into
the
castle
gate
in
the
hall
servants
waited
to
receive
her
and
she
was
conducted
forthwith
to
her
room
the
room
we
usually
sat
in
as
our
drawing
room
is
long
having
four
windows
that
looked
over
the
moat
and
drawbridge
upon
the
forest
scene
i
have
just
described
it
is
furnished
in
old
carved
oak
with
large
carved
cabinets
and
the
chairs
are
cushioned
with
crimson
utrecht
velvet
the
walls
are
covered
with
tapestry
and
surrounded
with
great
gold
frames
the
figures
being
as
large
as
life
in
ancient
and
very
curious
costume
and
the
subjects
represented
are
hunting
hawking
and
generally
festive
it
is
not
too
stately
to
be
extremely
comfortable
and
here
we
had
our
tea
for
with
his
usual
patriotic
leanings
he
insisted
that
the
national
beverage
should
make
its
appearance
regularly
with
our
coffee
and
chocolate
we
sat
here
this
night
and
with
candles
lighted
were
talking
over
the
adventure
of
the
evening
madame
perrodon
and
mademoiselle
de
lafontaine
were
both
of
our
party
the
young
stranger
had
hardly
lain
down
in
her
bed
when
she
sank
into
a
deep
sleep
and
those
ladies
had
left
her
in
the
care
of
a
servant
how
do
you
like
our
guest
i
asked
as
soon
as
madame
entered
tell
me
all
about
her
i
like
her
extremely
answered
madame
she
is
i
almost
think
the
prettiest
creature
i
ever
saw
about
your
age
and
so
gentle
and
nice
she
is
absolutely
beautiful
threw
in
mademoiselle
who
had
peeped
for
a
moment
into
the
stranger's
room
and
such
a
sweet
voice
added
madame
perrodon
did
you
remark
a
woman
in
the
carriage
after
it
was
set
up
again
who
did
not
get
out
inquired
mademoiselle
but
only
looked
from
the
window
no
we
had
not
seen
her
then
she
described
a
hideous
black
woman
with
a
sort
of
colored
turban
on
her
head
and
who
was
gazing
all
the
time
from
the
carriage
window
nodding
and
grinning
derisively
towards
the
ladies
with
gleaming
eyes
and
large
white
eyeballs
and
her
teeth
set
as
if
in
fury
did
you
remark
what
an
ill-looking
pack
of
men
the
servants
were
asked
madame
yes
said
my
father
who
had
just
come
in
ugly
hang-dog
looking
fellows
as
ever
i
beheld
in
my
life
i
hope
they
mayn't
rob
the
poor
lady
in
the
forest
they
are
clever
rogues
however
they
got
everything
to
rights
in
a
minute
i
dare
say
they
are
worn
out
with
too
long
traveling
said
madame
besides
looking
wicked
their
faces
were
so
strangely
lean
and
dark
and
sullen
i
am
very
curious
i
own
but
i
dare
say
the
young
lady
will
tell
you
all
about
it
tomorrow
if
she
is
sufficiently
recovered
i
don't
think
she
will
said
my
father
with
a
mysterious
smile
and
a
little
nod
of
his
head
as
if
he
knew
more
about
it
than
he
cared
to
tell
us
this
made
us
all
the
more
inquisitive
as
to
what
had
passed
between
him
and
the
lady
in
the
black
velvet
in
the
brief
but
earnest
interview
that
had
immediately
preceded
her
departure
we
were
scarcely
alone
when
i
entreated
him
to
tell
me
he
did
not
need
much
pressing
there
is
no
particular
reason
why
i
should
not
tell
you
she
expressed
a
reluctance
to
trouble
us
with
the
care
of
her
daughter
saying
she
was
in
delicate
health
and
nervous
but
not
subject
to
any
kind
of
seizure--she
volunteered
that--nor
to
any
illusion
being
in
fact
perfectly
sane
how
very
odd
to
say
all
that
i
interpolated
it
was
so
unnecessary
at
all
events
it
was
said
he
laughed
and
as
you
wish
to
know
all
that
passed
which
was
indeed
very
little
i
tell
you
she
then
said
'i
am
making
a
long
journey
of
vital
importance--she
emphasized
the
word--rapid
and
secret
i
shall
return
for
my
child
in
three
months
in
the
meantime
she
will
be
silent
as
to
who
we
are
whence
we
come
and
whither
we
are
traveling'
that
is
all
she
said
she
spoke
very
pure
french
when
she
said
the
word
'secret'
she
paused
for
a
few
seconds
looking
sternly
her
eyes
fixed
on
mine
i
fancy
she
makes
a
great
point
of
that
you
saw
how
quickly
she
was
gone
i
hope
i
have
not
done
a
very
foolish
thing
in
taking
charge
of
the
young
lady
for
my
part
i
was
delighted
i
was
longing
to
see
and
talk
to
her
and
only
waiting
till
the
doctor
should
give
me
leave
you
who
live
in
towns
can
have
no
idea
how
great
an
event
the
introduction
of
a
new
friend
is
in
such
a
solitude
as
surrounded
us
the
doctor
did
not
arrive
till
nearly
one
o'clock
but
i
could
no
more
have
gone
to
my
bed
and
slept
than
i
could
have
overtaken
on
foot
the
carriage
in
which
the
princess
in
black
velvet
had
driven
away
when
the
physician
came
down
to
the
drawing
room
it
was
to
report
very
favorably
upon
his
patient
she
was
now
sitting
up
her
pulse
quite
regular
apparently
perfectly
well
she
had
sustained
no
injury
and
the
little
shock
to
her
nerves
had
passed
away
quite
harmlessly
there
could
be
no
harm
certainly
in
my
seeing
her
if
we
both
wished
it
and
with
this
permission
i
sent
forthwith
to
know
whether
she
would
allow
me
to
visit
her
for
a
few
minutes
in
her
room
the
servant
returned
immediately
to
say
that
she
desired
nothing
more
you
may
be
sure
i
was
not
long
in
availing
myself
of
this
permission
our
visitor
lay
in
one
of
the
handsomest
rooms
in
the
schloss
it
was
perhaps
a
little
stately
there
was
a
somber
piece
of
tapestry
opposite
the
foot
of
the
bed
representing
cleopatra
with
the
asps
to
her
bosom
and
other
solemn
classic
scenes
were
displayed
a
little
faded
upon
the
other
walls
but
there
was
gold
carving
and
rich
and
varied
color
enough
in
the
other
decorations
of
the
room
to
more
than
redeem
the
gloom
of
the
old
tapestry
there
were
candles
at
the
bedside
she
was
sitting
up
her
slender
pretty
figure
enveloped
in
the
soft
silk
dressing
gown
embroidered
with
flowers
and
lined
with
thick
quilted
silk
which
her
mother
had
thrown
over
her
feet
as
she
lay
upon
the
ground
what
was
it
that
as
i
reached
the
bedside
and
had
just
begun
my
little
greeting
struck
me
dumb
in
a
moment
and
made
me
recoil
a
step
or
two
from
before
her
i
will
tell
you
i
saw
the
very
face
which
had
visited
me
in
my
childhood
at
night
which
remained
so
fixed
in
my
memory
and
on
which
i
had
for
so
many
years
so
often
ruminated
with
horror
when
no
one
suspected
of
what
i
was
thinking
it
was
pretty
even
beautiful
and
when
i
first
beheld
it
wore
the
same
melancholy
expression
but
this
almost
instantly
lighted
into
a
strange
fixed
smile
of
recognition
there
was
a
silence
of
fully
a
minute
and
then
at
length
she
spoke
i
could
not
how
wonderful
she
exclaimed
twelve
years
ago
i
saw
your
face
in
a
dream
and
it
has
haunted
me
ever
since
wonderful
indeed
i
repeated
overcoming
with
an
effort
the
horror
that
had
for
a
time
suspended
my
utterances
twelve
years
ago
in
vision
or
reality
i
certainly
saw
you
i
could
not
forget
your
face
it
has
remained
before
my
eyes
ever
since
her
smile
had
softened
whatever
i
had
fancied
strange
in
it
was
gone
and
it
and
her
dimpling
cheeks
were
now
delightfully
pretty
and
intelligent
i
felt
reassured
and
continued
more
in
the
vein
which
hospitality
indicated
to
bid
her
welcome
and
to
tell
her
how
much
pleasure
her
accidental
arrival
had
given
us
all
and
especially
what
a
happiness
it
was
to
me
i
took
her
hand
as
i
spoke
i
was
a
little
shy
as
lonely
people
are
but
the
situation
made
me
eloquent
and
even
bold
she
pressed
my
hand
she
laid
hers
upon
it
and
her
eyes
glowed
as
looking
hastily
into
mine
she
smiled
again
and
blushed
she
answered
my
welcome
very
prettily
i
sat
down
beside
her
still
wondering
and
she
said
i
must
tell
you
my
vision
about
you
it
is
so
very
strange
that
you
and
i
should
have
had
each
of
the
other
so
vivid
a
dream
that
each
should
have
seen
i
you
and
you
me
looking
as
we
do
now
when
of
course
we
both
were
mere
children
i
was
a
child
about
six
years
old
and
i
awoke
from
a
confused
and
troubled
dream
and
found
myself
in
a
room
unlike
my
nursery
wainscoted
clumsily
in
some
dark
wood
and
with
cupboards
and
bedsteads
and
chairs
and
benches
placed
about
it
the
beds
were
i
thought
all
empty
and
the
room
itself
without
anyone
but
myself
in
it
and
i
after
looking
about
me
for
some
time
and
admiring
especially
an
iron
candlestick
with
two
branches
which
i
should
certainly
know
again
crept
under
one
of
the
beds
to
reach
the
window
but
as
i
got
from
under
the
bed
i
heard
someone
crying
and
looking
up
while
i
was
still
upon
my
knees
i
saw
you--most
assuredly
you--as
i
see
you
now
a
beautiful
young
lady
with
golden
hair
and
large
blue
eyes
and
lips--your
lips--you
as
you
are
here
your
looks
won
me
i
climbed
on
the
bed
and
put
my
arms
about
you
and
i
think
we
both
fell
asleep
i
was
aroused
by
a
scream
you
were
sitting
up
screaming
i
was
frightened
and
slipped
down
upon
the
ground
and
it
seemed
to
me
lost
consciousness
for
a
moment
and
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
again
in
my
nursery
at
home
your
face
i
have
never
forgotten
since
i
could
not
be
misled
by
mere
resemblance
you
are
the
lady
whom
i
saw
then
it
was
now
my
turn
to
relate
my
corresponding
vision
which
i
did
to
the
undisguised
wonder
of
my
new
acquaintance
i
don't
know
which
should
be
most
afraid
of
the
other
she
said
again
smiling--if
you
were
less
pretty
i
think
i
should
be
very
much
afraid
of
you
but
being
as
you
are
and
you
and
i
both
so
young
i
feel
only
that
i
have
made
your
acquaintance
twelve
years
ago
and
have
already
a
right
to
your
intimacy
at
all
events
it
does
seem
as
if
we
were
destined
from
our
earliest
childhood
to
be
friends
i
wonder
whether
you
feel
as
strangely
drawn
towards
me
as
i
do
to
you
i
have
never
had
a
friend--shall
i
find
one
now
she
sighed
and
her
fine
dark
eyes
gazed
passionately
on
me
now
the
truth
is
i
felt
rather
unaccountably
towards
the
beautiful
stranger
i
did
feel
as
she
said
drawn
towards
her
but
there
was
also
something
of
repulsion
in
this
ambiguous
feeling
however
the
sense
of
attraction
immensely
prevailed
she
interested
and
won
me
she
was
so
beautiful
and
so
indescribably
engaging
i
perceived
now
something
of
languor
and
exhaustion
stealing
over
her
and
hastened
to
bid
her
good
night
the
doctor
thinks
i
added
that
you
ought
to
have
a
maid
to
sit
up
with
you
tonight
one
of
ours
is
waiting
and
you
will
find
her
a
very
useful
and
quiet
creature
how
kind
of
you
but
i
could
not
sleep
i
never
could
with
an
attendant
in
the
room
i
shan't
require
any
assistance--and
shall
i
confess
my
weakness
i
am
haunted
with
a
terror
of
robbers
our
house
was
robbed
once
and
two
servants
murdered
so
i
always
lock
my
door
it
has
become
a
habit--and
you
look
so
kind
i
know
you
will
forgive
me
i
see
there
is
a
key
in
the
lock
she
held
me
close
in
her
pretty
arms
for
a
moment
and
whispered
in
my
ear
good
night
darling
it
is
very
hard
to
part
with
you
but
good
night
tomorrow
but
not
early
i
shall
see
you
again
she
sank
back
on
the
pillow
with
a
sigh
and
her
fine
eyes
followed
me
with
a
fond
and
melancholy
gaze
and
she
murmured
again
good
night
dear
friend
young
people
like
and
even
love
on
impulse
i
was
flattered
by
the
evident
though
as
yet
undeserved
fondness
she
showed
me
i
liked
the
confidence
with
which
she
at
once
received
me
she
was
determined
that
we
should
be
very
near
friends
next
day
came
and
we
met
again
i
was
delighted
with
my
companion
that
is
to
say
in
many
respects
her
looks
lost
nothing
in
daylight--she
was
certainly
the
most
beautiful
creature
i
had
ever
seen
and
the
unpleasant
remembrance
of
the
face
presented
in
my
early
dream
had
lost
the
effect
of
the
first
unexpected
recognition
she
confessed
that
she
had
experienced
a
similar
shock
on
seeing
me
and
precisely
the
same
faint
antipathy
that
had
mingled
with
my
admiration
of
her
we
now
laughed
together
over
our
momentary
horrors
iv
her
habits--a
saunter
i
told
you
that
i
was
charmed
with
her
in
most
particulars
there
were
some
that
did
not
please
me
so
well
she
was
above
the
middle
height
of
women
i
shall
begin
by
describing
her
she
was
slender
and
wonderfully
graceful
except
that
her
movements
were
languid--very
languid--indeed
there
was
nothing
in
her
appearance
to
indicate
an
invalid
her
complexion
was
rich
and
brilliant
her
features
were
small
and
beautifully
formed
her
eyes
large
dark
and
lustrous
her
hair
was
quite
wonderful
i
never
saw
hair
so
magnificently
thick
and
long
when
it
was
down
about
her
shoulders
i
have
often
placed
my
hands
under
it
and
laughed
with
wonder
at
its
weight
it
was
exquisitely
fine
and
soft
and
in
color
a
rich
very
dark
brown
with
something
of
gold
i
loved
to
let
it
down
tumbling
with
its
own
weight
as
in
her
room
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
talking
in
her
sweet
low
voice
i
used
to
fold
and
braid
it
and
spread
it
out
and
play
with
it
heavens
if
i
had
but
known
all
i
said
there
were
particulars
which
did
not
please
me
i
have
told
you
that
her
confidence
won
me
the
first
night
i
saw
her
but
i
found
that
she
exercised
with
respect
to
herself
her
mother
her
history
everything
in
fact
connected
with
her
life
plans
and
people
an
ever
wakeful
reserve
i
dare
say
i
was
unreasonable
perhaps
i
was
wrong
i
dare
say
i
ought
to
have
respected
the
solemn
injunction
laid
upon
my
father
by
the
stately
lady
in
black
velvet
but
curiosity
is
a
restless
and
unscrupulous
passion
and
no
one
girl
can
endure
with
patience
that
hers
should
be
baffled
by
another
what
harm
could
it
do
anyone
to
tell
me
what
i
so
ardently
desired
to
know
had
she
no
trust
in
my
good
sense
or
honor
why
would
she
not
believe
me
when
i
assured
her
so
solemnly
that
i
would
not
divulge
one
syllable
of
what
she
told
me
to
any
mortal
breathing
there
was
a
coldness
it
seemed
to
me
beyond
her
years
in
her
smiling
melancholy
persistent
refusal
to
afford
me
the
least
ray
of
light
i
cannot
say
we
quarreled
upon
this
point
for
she
would
not
quarrel
upon
any
it
was
of
course
very
unfair
of
me
to
press
her
very
ill-bred
but
i
really
could
not
help
it
and
i
might
just
as
well
have
let
it
alone
what
she
did
tell
me
amounted
in
my
unconscionable
estimation--to
nothing
it
was
all
summed
up
in
three
very
vague
disclosures
first--her
name
was
carmilla
second--her
family
was
very
ancient
and
noble
third--her
home
lay
in
the
direction
of
the
west
she
would
not
tell
me
the
name
of
her
family
nor
their
armorial
bearings
nor
the
name
of
their
estate
nor
even
that
of
the
country
they
lived
in
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
i
worried
her
incessantly
on
these
subjects
i
watched
opportunity
and
rather
insinuated
than
urged
my
inquiries
once
or
twice
indeed
i
did
attack
her
more
directly
but
no
matter
what
my
tactics
utter
failure
was
invariably
the
result
reproaches
and
caresses
were
all
lost
upon
her
but
i
must
add
this
that
her
evasion
was
conducted
with
so
pretty
a
melancholy
and
deprecation
with
so
many
and
even
passionate
declarations
of
her
liking
for
me
and
trust
in
my
honor
and
with
so
many
promises
that
i
should
at
last
know
all
that
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
long
to
be
offended
with
her
she
used
to
place
her
pretty
arms
about
my
neck
draw
me
to
her
and
laying
her
cheek
to
mine
murmur
with
her
lips
near
my
ear
dearest
your
little
heart
is
wounded
think
me
not
cruel
because
i
obey
the
irresistible
law
of
my
strength
and
weakness
if
your
dear
heart
is
wounded
my
wild
heart
bleeds
with
yours
in
the
rapture
of
my
enormous
humiliation
i
live
in
your
warm
life
and
you
shall
die--die
sweetly
die--into
mine
i
cannot
help
it
as
i
draw
near
to
you
you
in
your
turn
will
draw
near
to
others
and
learn
the
rapture
of
that
cruelty
which
yet
is
love
so
for
a
while
seek
to
know
no
more
of
me
and
mine
but
trust
me
with
all
your
loving
spirit
and
when
she
had
spoken
such
a
rhapsody
she
would
press
me
more
closely
in
her
trembling
embrace
and
her
lips
in
soft
kisses
gently
glow
upon
my
cheek
her
agitations
and
her
language
were
unintelligible
to
me
from
these
foolish
embraces
which
were
not
of
very
frequent
occurrence
i
must
allow
i
used
to
wish
to
extricate
myself
but
my
energies
seemed
to
fail
me
her
murmured
words
sounded
like
a
lullaby
in
my
ear
and
soothed
my
resistance
into
a
trance
from
which
i
only
seemed
to
recover
myself
when
she
withdrew
her
arms
in
these
mysterious
moods
i
did
not
like
her
i
experienced
a
strange
tumultuous
excitement
that
was
pleasurable
ever
and
anon
mingled
with
a
vague
sense
of
fear
and
disgust
i
had
no
distinct
thoughts
about
her
while
such
scenes
lasted
but
i
was
conscious
of
a
love
growing
into
adoration
and
also
of
abhorrence
this
i
know
is
paradox
but
i
can
make
no
other
attempt
to
explain
the
feeling
i
now
write
after
an
interval
of
more
than
ten
years
with
a
trembling
hand
with
a
confused
and
horrible
recollection
of
certain
occurrences
and
situations
in
the
ordeal
through
which
i
was
unconsciously
passing
though
with
a
vivid
and
very
sharp
remembrance
of
the
main
current
of
my
story
but
i
suspect
in
all
lives
there
are
certain
emotional
scenes
those
in
which
our
passions
have
been
most
wildly
and
terribly
roused
that
are
of
all
others
the
most
vaguely
and
dimly
remembered
sometimes
after
an
hour
of
apathy
my
strange
and
beautiful
companion
would
take
my
hand
and
hold
it
with
a
fond
pressure
renewed
again
and
again
blushing
softly
gazing
in
my
face
with
languid
and
burning
eyes
and
breathing
so
fast
that
her
dress
rose
and
fell
with
the
tumultuous
respiration
it
was
like
the
ardor
of
a
lover
it
embarrassed
me
it
was
hateful
and
yet
over-powering
and
with
gloating
eyes
she
drew
me
to
her
and
her
hot
lips
traveled
along
my
cheek
in
kisses
and
she
would
whisper
almost
in
sobs
you
are
mine
you
shall
be
mine
you
and
i
are
one
for
ever
then
she
had
thrown
herself
back
in
her
chair
with
her
small
hands
over
her
eyes
leaving
me
trembling
are
we
related
i
used
to
ask
what
can
you
mean
by
all
this
i
remind
you
perhaps
of
someone
whom
you
love
but
you
must
not
i
hate
it
i
don't
know
you--i
don't
know
myself
when
you
look
so
and
talk
so
she
used
to
sigh
at
my
vehemence
then
turn
away
and
drop
my
hand
respecting
these
very
extraordinary
manifestations
i
strove
in
vain
to
form
any
satisfactory
theory--i
could
not
refer
them
to
affectation
or
trick
it
was
unmistakably
the
momentary
breaking
out
of
suppressed
instinct
and
emotion
was
she
notwithstanding
her
mother's
volunteered
denial
subject
to
brief
visitations
of
insanity
or
was
there
here
a
disguise
and
a
romance
i
had
read
in
old
storybooks
of
such
things
what
if
a
boyish
lover
had
found
his
way
into
the
house
and
sought
to
prosecute
his
suit
in
masquerade
with
the
assistance
of
a
clever
old
adventuress
but
there
were
many
things
against
this
hypothesis
highly
interesting
as
it
was
to
my
vanity
i
could
boast
of
no
little
attentions
such
as
masculine
gallantry
delights
to
offer
between
these
passionate
moments
there
were
long
intervals
of
commonplace
of
gaiety
of
brooding
melancholy
during
which
except
that
i
detected
her
eyes
so
full
of
melancholy
fire
following
me
at
times
i
might
have
been
as
nothing
to
her
except
in
these
brief
periods
of
mysterious
excitement
her
ways
were
girlish
and
there
was
always
a
languor
about
her
quite
incompatible
with
a
masculine
system
in
a
state
of
health
in
some
respects
her
habits
were
odd
perhaps
not
so
singular
in
the
opinion
of
a
town
lady
like
you
as
they
appeared
to
us
rustic
people
she
used
to
come
down
very
late
generally
not
till
one
o'clock
she
would
then
take
a
cup
of
chocolate
but
eat
nothing
we
then
went
out
for
a
walk
which
was
a
mere
saunter
and
she
seemed
almost
immediately
exhausted
and
either
returned
to
the
schloss
or
sat
on
one
of
the
benches
that
were
placed
here
and
there
among
the
trees
this
was
a
bodily
languor
in
which
her
mind
did
not
sympathize
she
was
always
an
animated
talker
and
very
intelligent
she
sometimes
alluded
for
a
moment
to
her
own
home
or
mentioned
an
adventure
or
situation
or
an
early
recollection
which
indicated
a
people
of
strange
manners
and
described
customs
of
which
we
knew
nothing
i
gathered
from
these
chance
hints
that
her
native
country
was
much
more
remote
than
i
had
at
first
fancied
as
we
sat
thus
one
afternoon
under
the
trees
a
funeral
passed
us
by
it
was
that
of
a
pretty
young
girl
whom
i
had
often
seen
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
rangers
of
the
forest
the
poor
man
was
walking
behind
the
coffin
of
his
darling
she
was
his
only
child
and
he
looked
quite
heartbroken
peasants
walking
two-and-two
came
behind
they
were
singing
a
funeral
hymn
i
rose
to
mark
my
respect
as
they
passed
and
joined
in
the
hymn
they
were
very
sweetly
singing
my
companion
shook
me
a
little
roughly
and
i
turned
surprised
she
said
brusquely
don't
you
perceive
how
discordant
that
is
i
think
it
very
sweet
on
the
contrary
i
answered
vexed
at
the
interruption
and
very
uncomfortable
lest
the
people
who
composed
the
little
procession
should
observe
and
resent
what
was
passing
i
resumed
therefore
instantly
and
was
again
interrupted
you
pierce
my
ears
said
carmilla
almost
angrily
and
stopping
her
ears
with
her
tiny
fingers
besides
how
can
you
tell
that
your
religion
and
mine
are
the
same
your
forms
wound
me
and
i
hate
funerals
what
a
fuss
why
you
must
die--everyone
must
die
and
all
are
happier
when
they
do
come
home
my
father
has
gone
on
with
the
clergyman
to
the
churchyard
i
thought
you
knew
she
was
to
be
buried
today
she
i
don't
trouble
my
head
about
peasants
i
don't
know
who
she
is
answered
carmilla
with
a
flash
from
her
fine
eyes
she
is
the
poor
girl
who
fancied
she
saw
a
ghost
a
fortnight
ago
and
has
been
dying
ever
since
till
yesterday
when
she
expired
tell
me
nothing
about
ghosts
i
shan't
sleep
tonight
if
you
do
i
hope
there
is
no
plague
or
fever
coming
all
this
looks
very
like
it
i
continued
the
swineherd's
young
wife
died
only
a
week
ago
and
she
thought
something
seized
her
by
the
throat
as
she
lay
in
her
bed
and
nearly
strangled
her
papa
says
such
horrible
fancies
do
accompany
some
forms
of
fever
she
was
quite
well
the
day
before
she
sank
afterwards
and
died
before
a
week
well
her
funeral
is
over
i
hope
and
her
hymn
sung
and
our
ears
shan't
be
tortured
with
that
discord
and
jargon
it
has
made
me
nervous
sit
down
here
beside
me
sit
close
hold
my
hand
press
it
hard-hard-harder
we
had
moved
a
little
back
and
had
come
to
another
seat
she
sat
down
her
face
underwent
a
change
that
alarmed
and
even
terrified
me
for
a
moment
it
darkened
and
became
horribly
livid
her
teeth
and
hands
were
clenched
and
she
frowned
and
compressed
her
lips
while
she
stared
down
upon
the
ground
at
her
feet
and
trembled
all
over
with
a
continued
shudder
as
irrepressible
as
ague
all
her
energies
seemed
strained
to
suppress
a
fit
with
which
she
was
then
breathlessly
tugging
and
at
length
a
low
convulsive
cry
of
suffering
broke
from
her
and
gradually
the
hysteria
subsided
there
that
comes
of
strangling
people
with
hymns
she
said
at
last
hold
me
hold
me
still
it
is
passing
away
and
so
gradually
it
did
and
perhaps
to
dissipate
the
somber
impression
which
the
spectacle
had
left
upon
me
she
became
unusually
animated
and
chatty
and
so
we
got
home
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
her
exhibit
any
definable
symptoms
of
that
delicacy
of
health
which
her
mother
had
spoken
of
it
was
the
first
time
also
i
had
seen
her
exhibit
anything
like
temper
both
passed
away
like
a
summer
cloud
and
never
but
once
afterwards
did
i
witness
on
her
part
a
momentary
sign
of
anger
i
will
tell
you
how
it
happened
she
and
i
were
looking
out
of
one
of
the
long
drawing
room
windows
when
there
entered
the
courtyard
over
the
drawbridge
a
figure
of
a
wanderer
whom
i
knew
very
well
he
used
to
visit
the
schloss
generally
twice
a
year
it
was
the
figure
of
a
hunchback
with
the
sharp
lean
features
that
generally
accompany
deformity
he
wore
a
pointed
black
beard
and
he
was
smiling
from
ear
to
ear
showing
his
white
fangs
he
was
dressed
in
buff
black
and
scarlet
and
crossed
with
more
straps
and
belts
than
i
could
count
from
which
hung
all
manner
of
things
behind
he
carried
a
magic
lantern
and
two
boxes
which
i
well
knew
in
one
of
which
was
a
salamander
and
in
the
other
a
mandrake
these
monsters
used
to
make
my
father
laugh
they
were
compounded
of
parts
of
monkeys
parrots
squirrels
fish
and
hedgehogs
dried
and
stitched
together
with
great
neatness
and
startling
effect
he
had
a
fiddle
a
box
of
conjuring
apparatus
a
pair
of
foils
and
masks
attached
to
his
belt
several
other
mysterious
cases
dangling
about
him
and
a
black
staff
with
copper
ferrules
in
his
hand
his
companion
was
a
rough
spare
dog
that
followed
at
his
heels
but
stopped
short
suspiciously
at
the
drawbridge
and
in
a
little
while
began
to
howl
dismally
in
the
meantime
the
mountebank
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
courtyard
raised
his
grotesque
hat
and
made
us
a
very
ceremonious
bow
paying
his
compliments
very
volubly
in
execrable
french
and
german
not
much
better
then
disengaging
his
fiddle
he
began
to
scrape
a
lively
air
to
which
he
sang
with
a
merry
discord
dancing
with
ludicrous
airs
and
activity
that
made
me
laugh
in
spite
of
the
dog's
howling
then
he
advanced
to
the
window
with
many
smiles
and
salutations
and
his
hat
in
his
left
hand
his
fiddle
under
his
arm
and
with
a
fluency
that
never
took
breath
he
gabbled
a
long
advertisement
of
all
his
accomplishments
and
the
resources
of
the
various
arts
which
he
placed
at
our
service
and
the
curiosities
and
entertainments
which
it
was
in
his
power
at
our
bidding
to
display
will
your
ladyships
be
pleased
to
buy
an
amulet
against
the
oupire
which
is
going
like
the
wolf
i
hear
through
these
woods
he
said
dropping
his
hat
on
the
pavement
they
are
dying
of
it
right
and
left
and
here
is
a
charm
that
never
fails
only
pinned
to
the
pillow
and
you
may
laugh
in
his
face
these
charms
consisted
of
oblong
slips
of
vellum
with
cabalistic
ciphers
and
diagrams
upon
them
carmilla
instantly
purchased
one
and
so
did
i
he
was
looking
up
and
we
were
smiling
down
upon
him
amused
at
least
i
can
answer
for
myself
his
piercing
black
eye
as
he
looked
up
in
our
faces
seemed
to
detect
something
that
fixed
for
a
moment
his
curiosity
in
an
instant
he
unrolled
a
leather
case
full
of
all
manner
of
odd
little
steel
instruments
see
here
my
lady
he
said
displaying
it
and
addressing
me
i
profess
among
other
things
less
useful
the
art
of
dentistry
plague
take
the
dog
he
interpolated
silence
beast
he
howls
so
that
your
ladyships
can
scarcely
hear
a
word
your
noble
friend
the
young
lady
at
your
right
has
the
sharpest
tooth--long
thin
pointed
like
an
awl
like
a
needle
ha
ha
with
my
sharp
and
long
sight
as
i
look
up
i
have
seen
it
distinctly
now
if
it
happens
to
hurt
the
young
lady
and
i
think
it
must
here
am
i
here
are
my
file
my
punch
my
nippers
i
will
make
it
round
and
blunt
if
her
ladyship
pleases
no
longer
the
tooth
of
a
fish
but
of
a
beautiful
young
lady
as
she
is
hey
is
the
young
lady
displeased
have
i
been
too
bold
have
i
offended
her
the
young
lady
indeed
looked
very
angry
as
she
drew
back
from
the
window
how
dares
that
mountebank
insult
us
so
where
is
your
father
i
shall
demand
redress
from
him
my
father
would
have
had
the
wretch
tied
up
to
the
pump
and
flogged
with
a
cart
whip
and
burnt
to
the
bones
with
the
cattle
brand
she
retired
from
the
window
a
step
or
two
and
sat
down
and
had
hardly
lost
sight
of
the
offender
when
her
wrath
subsided
as
suddenly
as
it
had
risen
and
she
gradually
recovered
her
usual
tone
and
seemed
to
forget
the
little
hunchback
and
his
follies
my
father
was
out
of
spirits
that
evening
on
coming
in
he
told
us
that
there
had
been
another
case
very
similar
to
the
two
fatal
ones
which
had
lately
occurred
the
sister
of
a
young
peasant
on
his
estate
only
a
mile
away
was
very
ill
had
been
as
she
described
it
attacked
very
nearly
in
the
same
way
and
was
now
slowly
but
steadily
sinking
all
this
said
my
father
is
strictly
referable
to
natural
causes
these
poor
people
infect
one
another
with
their
superstitions
and
so
repeat
in
imagination
the
images
of
terror
that
have
infested
their
neighbors
but
that
very
circumstance
frightens
one
horribly
said
carmilla
how
so
inquired
my
father
i
am
so
afraid
of
fancying
i
see
such
things
i
think
it
would
be
as
bad
as
reality
we
are
in
god's
hands
nothing
can
happen
without
his
permission
and
all
will
end
well
for
those
who
love
him
he
is
our
faithful
creator
he
has
made
us
all
and
will
take
care
of
us
creator
nature
said
the
young
lady
in
answer
to
my
gentle
father
and
this
disease
that
invades
the
country
is
natural
nature
all
things
proceed
from
nature--don't
they
all
things
in
the
heaven
in
the
earth
and
under
the
earth
act
and
live
as
nature
ordains
i
think
so
the
doctor
said
he
would
come
here
today
said
my
father
after
a
silence
i
want
to
know
what
he
thinks
about
it
and
what
he
thinks
we
had
better
do
doctors
never
did
me
any
good
said
carmilla
then
you
have
been
ill
i
asked
more
ill
than
ever
you
were
she
answered
long
ago
yes
a
long
time
i
suffered
from
this
very
illness
but
i
forget
all
but
my
pain
and
weakness
and
they
were
not
so
bad
as
are
suffered
in
other
diseases
you
were
very
young
then
i
dare
say
let
us
talk
no
more
of
it
you
would
not
wound
a
friend
she
looked
languidly
in
my
eyes
and
passed
her
arm
round
my
waist
lovingly
and
led
me
out
of
the
room
my
father
was
busy
over
some
papers
near
the
window
why
does
your
papa
like
to
frighten
us
said
the
pretty
girl
with
a
sigh
and
a
little
shudder
he
doesn't
dear
carmilla
it
is
the
very
furthest
thing
from
his
mind
are
you
afraid
dearest
i
should
be
very
much
if
i
fancied
there
was
any
real
danger
of
my
being
attacked
as
those
poor
people
were
you
are
afraid
to
die
yes
every
one
is
but
to
die
as
lovers
may--to
die
together
so
that
they
may
live
together
girls
are
caterpillars
while
they
live
in
the
world
to
be
finally
butterflies
when
the
summer
comes
but
in
the
meantime
there
are
grubs
and
larvae
don't
you
see--each
with
their
peculiar
propensities
necessities
and
structure
so
says
monsieur
buffon
in
his
big
book
in
the
next
room
later
in
the
day
the
doctor
came
and
was
closeted
with
papa
for
some
time
he
was
a
skilful
man
of
sixty
and
upwards
he
wore
powder
and
shaved
his
pale
face
as
smooth
as
a
pumpkin
he
and
papa
emerged
from
the
room
together
and
i
heard
papa
laugh
and
say
as
they
came
out
well
i
do
wonder
at
a
wise
man
like
you
what
do
you
say
to
hippogriffs
and
dragons
the
doctor
was
smiling
and
made
answer
shaking
his
head--
nevertheless
life
and
death
are
mysterious
states
and
we
know
little
of
the
resources
of
either
and
so
they
walked
on
and
i
heard
no
more
i
did
not
then
know
what
the
doctor
had
been
broaching
but
i
think
i
guess
it
now
v
a
wonderful
likeness
this
evening
there
arrived
from
gratz
the
grave
dark-faced
son
of
the
picture
cleaner
with
a
horse
and
cart
laden
with
two
large
packing
cases
having
many
pictures
in
each
it
was
a
journey
of
ten
leagues
and
whenever
a
messenger
arrived
at
the
schloss
from
our
little
capital
of
gratz
we
used
to
crowd
about
him
in
the
hall
to
hear
the
news
this
arrival
created
in
our
secluded
quarters
quite
a
sensation
the
cases
remained
in
the
hall
and
the
messenger
was
taken
charge
of
by
the
servants
till
he
had
eaten
his
supper
then
with
assistants
and
armed
with
hammer
ripping
chisel
and
turnscrew
he
met
us
in
the
hall
where
we
had
assembled
to
witness
the
unpacking
of
the
cases
carmilla
sat
looking
listlessly
on
while
one
after
the
other
the
old
pictures
nearly
all
portraits
which
had
undergone
the
process
of
renovation
were
brought
to
light
my
mother
was
of
an
old
hungarian
family
and
most
of
these
pictures
which
were
about
to
be
restored
to
their
places
had
come
to
us
through
her
my
father
had
a
list
in
his
hand
from
which
he
read
as
the
artist
rummaged
out
the
corresponding
numbers
i
don't
know
that
the
pictures
were
very
good
but
they
were
undoubtedly
very
old
and
some
of
them
very
curious
also
they
had
for
the
most
part
the
merit
of
being
now
seen
by
me
i
may
say
for
the
first
time
for
the
smoke
and
dust
of
time
had
all
but
obliterated
them
there
is
a
picture
that
i
have
not
seen
yet
said
my
father
in
one
corner
at
the
top
of
it
is
the
name
as
well
as
i
could
read
'marcia
karnstein'
and
the
date
'1698'
and
i
am
curious
to
see
how
it
has
turned
out
i
remembered
it
it
was
a
small
picture
about
a
foot
and
a
half
high
and
nearly
square
without
a
frame
but
it
was
so
blackened
by
age
that
i
could
not
make
it
out
the
artist
now
produced
it
with
evident
pride
it
was
quite
beautiful
it
was
startling
it
seemed
to
live
it
was
the
effigy
of
carmilla
carmilla
dear
here
is
an
absolute
miracle
here
you
are
living
smiling
ready
to
speak
in
this
picture
isn't
it
beautiful
papa
and
see
even
the
little
mole
on
her
throat
my
father
laughed
and
said
certainly
it
is
a
wonderful
likeness
but
he
looked
away
and
to
my
surprise
seemed
but
little
struck
by
it
and
went
on
talking
to
the
picture
cleaner
who
was
also
something
of
an
artist
and
discoursed
with
intelligence
about
the
portraits
or
other
works
which
his
art
had
just
brought
into
light
and
color
while
i
was
more
and
more
lost
in
wonder
the
more
i
looked
at
the
picture
will
you
let
me
hang
this
picture
in
my
room
papa
i
asked
certainly
dear
said
he
smiling
i'm
very
glad
you
think
it
so
like
it
must
be
prettier
even
than
i
thought
it
if
it
is
the
young
lady
did
not
acknowledge
this
pretty
speech
did
not
seem
to
hear
it
she
was
leaning
back
in
her
seat
her
fine
eyes
under
their
long
lashes
gazing
on
me
in
contemplation
and
she
smiled
in
a
kind
of
rapture
and
now
you
can
read
quite
plainly
the
name
that
is
written
in
the
corner
it
is
not
marcia
it
looks
as
if
it
was
done
in
gold
the
name
is
mircalla
countess
karnstein
and
this
is
a
little
coronet
over
and
underneath
ad
1698
i
am
descended
from
the
karnsteins
that
is
mamma
was
ah
said
the
lady
languidly
so
am
i
i
think
a
very
long
descent
very
ancient
are
there
any
karnsteins
living
now
none
who
bear
the
name
i
believe
the
family
were
ruined
i
believe
in
some
civil
wars
long
ago
but
the
ruins
of
the
castle
are
only
about
three
miles
away
how
interesting
she
said
languidly
but
see
what
beautiful
moonlight
she
glanced
through
the
hall
door
which
stood
a
little
open
suppose
you
take
a
little
ramble
round
the
court
and
look
down
at
the
road
and
river
it
is
so
like
the
night
you
came
to
us
i
said
she
sighed
smiling
she
rose
and
each
with
her
arm
about
the
other's
waist
we
walked
out
upon
the
pavement
in
silence
slowly
we
walked
down
to
the
drawbridge
where
the
beautiful
landscape
opened
before
us
and
so
you
were
thinking
of
the
night
i
came
here
she
almost
whispered
are
you
glad
i
came
delighted
dear
carmilla
i
answered
and
you
asked
for
the
picture
you
think
like
me
to
hang
in
your
room
she
murmured
with
a
sigh
as
she
drew
her
arm
closer
about
my
waist
and
let
her
pretty
head
sink
upon
my
shoulder
how
romantic
you
are
carmilla
i
said
whenever
you
tell
me
your
story
it
will
be
made
up
chiefly
of
some
one
great
romance
she
kissed
me
silently
i
am
sure
carmilla
you
have
been
in
love
that
there
is
at
this
moment
an
affair
of
the
heart
going
on
i
have
been
in
love
with
no
one
and
never
shall
she
whispered
unless
it
should
be
with
you
how
beautiful
she
looked
in
the
moonlight
shy
and
strange
was
the
look
with
which
she
quickly
hid
her
face
in
my
neck
and
hair
with
tumultuous
sighs
that
seemed
almost
to
sob
and
pressed
in
mine
a
hand
that
trembled
her
soft
cheek
was
glowing
against
mine
darling
darling
she
murmured
i
live
in
you
and
you
would
die
for
me
i
love
you
so
i
started
from
her
she
was
gazing
on
me
with
eyes
from
which
all
fire
all
meaning
had
flown
and
a
face
colorless
and
apathetic
is
there
a
chill
in
the
air
dear
she
said
drowsily
i
almost
shiver
have
i
been
dreaming
let
us
come
in
come
come
come
in
you
look
ill
carmilla
a
little
faint
you
certainly
must
take
some
wine
i
said
yes
i
will
i'm
better
now
i
shall
be
quite
well
in
a
few
minutes
yes
do
give
me
a
little
wine
answered
carmilla
as
we
approached
the
door
let
us
look
again
for
a
moment
it
is
the
last
time
perhaps
i
shall
see
the
moonlight
with
you
how
do
you
feel
now
dear
carmilla
are
you
really
better
i
asked
i
was
beginning
to
take
alarm
lest
she
should
have
been
stricken
with
the
strange
epidemic
that
they
said
had
invaded
the
country
about
us
papa
would
be
grieved
beyond
measure
i
added
if
he
thought
you
were
ever
so
little
ill
without
immediately
letting
us
know
we
have
a
very
skilful
doctor
near
us
the
physician
who
was
with
papa
today
i'm
sure
he
is
i
know
how
kind
you
all
are
but
dear
child
i
am
quite
well
again
there
is
nothing
ever
wrong
with
me
but
a
little
weakness
people
say
i
am
languid
i
am
incapable
of
exertion
i
can
scarcely
walk
as
far
as
a
child
of
three
years
old
and
every
now
and
then
the
little
strength
i
have
falters
and
i
become
as
you
have
just
seen
me
but
after
all
i
am
very
easily
set
up
again
in
a
moment
i
am
perfectly
myself
see
how
i
have
recovered
so
indeed
she
had
and
she
and
i
talked
a
great
deal
and
very
animated
she
was
and
the
remainder
of
that
evening
passed
without
any
recurrence
of
what
i
called
her
infatuations
i
mean
her
crazy
talk
and
looks
which
embarrassed
and
even
frightened
me
but
there
occurred
that
night
an
event
which
gave
my
thoughts
quite
a
new
turn
and
seemed
to
startle
even
carmilla's
languid
nature
into
momentary
energy
vi
a
very
strange
agony
when
we
got
into
the
drawing
room
and
had
sat
down
to
our
coffee
and
chocolate
although
carmilla
did
not
take
any
she
seemed
quite
herself
again
and
madame
and
mademoiselle
de
lafontaine
joined
us
and
made
a
little
card
party
in
the
course
of
which
papa
came
in
for
what
he
called
his
dish
of
tea
when
the
game
was
over
he
sat
down
beside
carmilla
on
the
sofa
and
asked
her
a
little
anxiously
whether
she
had
heard
from
her
mother
since
her
arrival
she
answered
no
he
then
asked
whether
she
knew
where
a
letter
would
reach
her
at
present
i
cannot
tell
she
answered
ambiguously
but
i
have
been
thinking
of
leaving
you
you
have
been
already
too
hospitable
and
too
kind
to
me
i
have
given
you
an
infinity
of
trouble
and
i
should
wish
to
take
a
carriage
tomorrow
and
post
in
pursuit
of
her
i
know
where
i
shall
ultimately
find
her
although
i
dare
not
yet
tell
you
but
you
must
not
dream
of
any
such
thing
exclaimed
my
father
to
my
great
relief
we
can't
afford
to
lose
you
so
and
i
won't
consent
to
your
leaving
us
except
under
the
care
of
your
mother
who
was
so
good
as
to
consent
to
your
remaining
with
us
till
she
should
herself
return
i
should
be
quite
happy
if
i
knew
that
you
heard
from
her
but
this
evening
the
accounts
of
the
progress
of
the
mysterious
disease
that
has
invaded
our
neighborhood
grow
even
more
alarming
and
my
beautiful
guest
i
do
feel
the
responsibility
unaided
by
advice
from
your
mother
very
much
but
i
shall
do
my
best
and
one
thing
is
certain
that
you
must
not
think
of
leaving
us
without
her
distinct
direction
to
that
effect
we
should
suffer
too
much
in
parting
from
you
to
consent
to
it
easily
thank
you
sir
a
thousand
times
for
your
hospitality
she
answered
smiling
bashfully
you
have
all
been
too
kind
to
me
i
have
seldom
been
so
happy
in
all
my
life
before
as
in
your
beautiful
chateau
under
your
care
and
in
the
society
of
your
dear
daughter
so
he
gallantly
in
his
old-fashioned
way
kissed
her
hand
smiling
and
pleased
at
her
little
speech
i
accompanied
carmilla
as
usual
to
her
room
and
sat
and
chatted
with
her
while
she
was
preparing
for
bed
do
you
think
i
said
at
length
that
you
will
ever
confide
fully
in
me
she
turned
round
smiling
but
made
no
answer
only
continued
to
smile
on
me
you
won't
answer
that
i
said
you
can't
answer
pleasantly
i
ought
not
to
have
asked
you
you
were
quite
right
to
ask
me
that
or
anything
you
do
not
know
how
dear
you
are
to
me
or
you
could
not
think
any
confidence
too
great
to
look
for
but
i
am
under
vows
no
nun
half
so
awfully
and
i
dare
not
tell
my
story
yet
even
to
you
the
time
is
very
near
when
you
shall
know
everything
you
will
think
me
cruel
very
selfish
but
love
is
always
selfish
the
more
ardent
the
more
selfish
how
jealous
i
am
you
cannot
know
you
must
come
with
me
loving
me
to
death
or
else
hate
me
and
still
come
with
me
and
hating
me
through
death
and
after
there
is
no
such
word
as
indifference
in
my
apathetic
nature
now
carmilla
you
are
going
to
talk
your
wild
nonsense
again
i
said
hastily
not
i
silly
little
fool
as
i
am
and
full
of
whims
and
fancies
for
your
sake
i'll
talk
like
a
sage
were
you
ever
at
a
ball
no
how
you
do
run
on
what
is
it
like
how
charming
it
must
be
i
almost
forget
it
is
years
ago
i
laughed
you
are
not
so
old
your
first
ball
can
hardly
be
forgotten
yet
i
remember
everything
about
it--with
an
effort
i
see
it
all
as
divers
see
what
is
going
on
above
them
through
a
medium
dense
rippling
but
transparent
there
occurred
that
night
what
has
confused
the
picture
and
made
its
colours
faint
i
was
all
but
assassinated
in
my
bed
wounded
here
she
touched
her
breast
and
never
was
the
same
since
were
you
near
dying
yes
very--a
cruel
love--strange
love
that
would
have
taken
my
life
love
will
have
its
sacrifices
no
sacrifice
without
blood
let
us
go
to
sleep
now
i
feel
so
lazy
how
can
i
get
up
just
now
and
lock
my
door
she
was
lying
with
her
tiny
hands
buried
in
her
rich
wavy
hair
under
her
cheek
her
little
head
upon
the
pillow
and
her
glittering
eyes
followed
me
wherever
i
moved
with
a
kind
of
shy
smile
that
i
could
not
decipher
i
bid
her
good
night
and
crept
from
the
room
with
an
uncomfortable
sensation
i
often
wondered
whether
our
pretty
guest
ever
said
her
prayers
i
certainly
had
never
seen
her
upon
her
knees
in
the
morning
she
never
came
down
until
long
after
our
family
prayers
were
over
and
at
night
she
never
left
the
drawing
room
to
attend
our
brief
evening
prayers
in
the
hall
if
it
had
not
been
that
it
had
casually
come
out
in
one
of
our
careless
talks
that
she
had
been
baptised
i
should
have
doubted
her
being
a
christian
religion
was
a
subject
on
which
i
had
never
heard
her
speak
a
word
if
i
had
known
the
world
better
this
particular
neglect
or
antipathy
would
not
have
so
much
surprised
me
the
precautions
of
nervous
people
are
infectious
and
persons
of
a
like
temperament
are
pretty
sure
after
a
time
to
imitate
them
i
had
adopted
carmilla's
habit
of
locking
her
bedroom
door
having
taken
into
my
head
all
her
whimsical
alarms
about
midnight
invaders
and
prowling
assassins
i
had
also
adopted
her
precaution
of
making
a
brief
search
through
her
room
to
satisfy
herself
that
no
lurking
assassin
or
robber
was
ensconced
these
wise
measures
taken
i
got
into
my
bed
and
fell
asleep
a
light
was
burning
in
my
room
this
was
an
old
habit
of
very
early
date
and
which
nothing
could
have
tempted
me
to
dispense
with
thus
fortified
i
might
take
my
rest
in
peace
but
dreams
come
through
stone
walls
light
up
dark
rooms
or
darken
light
ones
and
their
persons
make
their
exits
and
their
entrances
as
they
please
and
laugh
at
locksmiths
i
had
a
dream
that
night
that
was
the
beginning
of
a
very
strange
agony
i
cannot
call
it
a
nightmare
for
i
was
quite
conscious
of
being
asleep
but
i
was
equally
conscious
of
being
in
my
room
and
lying
in
bed
precisely
as
i
actually
was
i
saw
or
fancied
i
saw
the
room
and
its
furniture
just
as
i
had
seen
it
last
except
that
it
was
very
dark
and
i
saw
something
moving
round
the
foot
of
the
bed
which
at
first
i
could
not
accurately
distinguish
but
i
soon
saw
that
it
was
a
sooty-black
animal
that
resembled
a
monstrous
cat
it
appeared
to
me
about
four
or
five
feet
long
for
it
measured
fully
the
length
of
the
hearthrug
as
it
passed
over
it
and
it
continued
to-ing
and
fro-ing
with
the
lithe
sinister
restlessness
of
a
beast
in
a
cage
i
could
not
cry
out
although
as
you
may
suppose
i
was
terrified
its
pace
was
growing
faster
and
the
room
rapidly
darker
and
darker
and
at
length
so
dark
that
i
could
no
longer
see
anything
of
it
but
its
eyes
i
felt
it
spring
lightly
on
the
bed
the
two
broad
eyes
approached
my
face
and
suddenly
i
felt
a
stinging
pain
as
if
two
large
needles
darted
an
inch
or
two
apart
deep
into
my
breast
i
waked
with
a
scream
the
room
was
lighted
by
the
candle
that
burnt
there
all
through
the
night
and
i
saw
a
female
figure
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
a
little
at
the
right
side
it
was
in
a
dark
loose
dress
and
its
hair
was
down
and
covered
its
shoulders
a
block
of
stone
could
not
have
been
more
still
there
was
not
the
slightest
stir
of
respiration
as
i
stared
at
it
the
figure
appeared
to
have
changed
its
place
and
was
now
nearer
the
door
then
close
to
it
the
door
opened
and
it
passed
out
i
was
now
relieved
and
able
to
breathe
and
move
my
first
thought
was
that
carmilla
had
been
playing
me
a
trick
and
that
i
had
forgotten
to
secure
my
door
i
hastened
to
it
and
found
it
locked
as
usual
on
the
inside
i
was
afraid
to
open
it--i
was
horrified
i
sprang
into
my
bed
and
covered
my
head
up
in
the
bedclothes
and
lay
there
more
dead
than
alive
till
morning
vii
descending
it
would
be
vain
my
attempting
to
tell
you
the
horror
with
which
even
now
i
recall
the
occurrence
of
that
night
it
was
no
such
transitory
terror
as
a
dream
leaves
behind
it
it
seemed
to
deepen
by
time
and
communicated
itself
to
the
room
and
the
very
furniture
that
had
encompassed
the
apparition
i
could
not
bear
next
day
to
be
alone
for
a
moment
i
should
have
told
papa
but
for
two
opposite
reasons
at
one
time
i
thought
he
would
laugh
at
my
story
and
i
could
not
bear
its
being
treated
as
a
jest
and
at
another
i
thought
he
might
fancy
that
i
had
been
attacked
by
the
mysterious
complaint
which
had
invaded
our
neighborhood
i
had
myself
no
misgiving
of
the
kind
and
as
he
had
been
rather
an
invalid
for
some
time
i
was
afraid
of
alarming
him
i
was
comfortable
enough
with
my
good-natured
companions
madame
perrodon
and
the
vivacious
mademoiselle
lafontaine
they
both
perceived
that
i
was
out
of
spirits
and
nervous
and
at
length
i
told
them
what
lay
so
heavy
at
my
heart
mademoiselle
laughed
but
i
fancied
that
madame
perrodon
looked
anxious
by-the-by
said
mademoiselle
laughing
the
long
lime
tree
walk
behind
carmilla's
bedroom
window
is
haunted
nonsense
exclaimed
madame
who
probably
thought
the
theme
rather
inopportune
and
who
tells
that
story
my
dear
martin
says
that
he
came
up
twice
when
the
old
yard
gate
was
being
repaired
before
sunrise
and
twice
saw
the
same
female
figure
walking
down
the
lime
tree
avenue
so
he
well
might
as
long
as
there
are
cows
to
milk
in
the
river
fields
said
madame
i
daresay
but
martin
chooses
to
be
frightened
and
never
did
i
see
fool
more
frightened
you
must
not
say
a
word
about
it
to
carmilla
because
she
can
see
down
that
walk
from
her
room
window
i
interposed
and
she
is
if
possible
a
greater
coward
than
i
carmilla
came
down
rather
later
than
usual
that
day
i
was
so
frightened
last
night
she
said
so
soon
as
were
together
and
i
am
sure
i
should
have
seen
something
dreadful
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
charm
i
bought
from
the
poor
little
hunchback
whom
i
called
such
hard
names
i
had
a
dream
of
something
black
coming
round
my
bed
and
i
awoke
in
a
perfect
horror
and
i
really
thought
for
some
seconds
i
saw
a
dark
figure
near
the
chimney-piece
but
i
felt
under
my
pillow
for
my
charm
and
the
moment
my
fingers
touched
it
the
figure
disappeared
and
i
felt
quite
certain
only
that
i
had
it
by
me
that
something
frightful
would
have
made
its
appearance
and
perhaps
throttled
me
as
it
did
those
poor
people
we
heard
of
well
listen
to
me
i
began
and
recounted
my
adventure
at
the
recital
of
which
she
appeared
horrified
and
had
you
the
charm
near
you
she
asked
earnestly
no
i
had
dropped
it
into
a
china
vase
in
the
drawing
room
but
i
shall
certainly
take
it
with
me
tonight
as
you
have
so
much
faith
in
it
at
this
distance
of
time
i
cannot
tell
you
or
even
understand
how
i
overcame
my
horror
so
effectually
as
to
lie
alone
in
my
room
that
night
i
remember
distinctly
that
i
pinned
the
charm
to
my
pillow
i
fell
asleep
almost
immediately
and
slept
even
more
soundly
than
usual
all
night
next
night
i
passed
as
well
my
sleep
was
delightfully
deep
and
dreamless
but
i
wakened
with
a
sense
of
lassitude
and
melancholy
which
however
did
not
exceed
a
degree
that
was
almost
luxurious
well
i
told
you
so
said
carmilla
when
i
described
my
quiet
sleep
i
had
such
delightful
sleep
myself
last
night
i
pinned
the
charm
to
the
breast
of
my
nightdress
it
was
too
far
away
the
night
before
i
am
quite
sure
it
was
all
fancy
except
the
dreams
i
used
to
think
that
evil
spirits
made
dreams
but
our
doctor
told
me
it
is
no
such
thing
only
a
fever
passing
by
or
some
other
malady
as
they
often
do
he
said
knocks
at
the
door
and
not
being
able
to
get
in
passes
on
with
that
alarm
and
what
do
you
think
the
charm
is
said
i
it
has
been
fumigated
or
immersed
in
some
drug
and
is
an
antidote
against
the
malaria
she
answered
then
it
acts
only
on
the
body
certainly
you
don't
suppose
that
evil
spirits
are
frightened
by
bits
of
ribbon
or
the
perfumes
of
a
druggist's
shop
no
these
complaints
wandering
in
the
air
begin
by
trying
the
nerves
and
so
infect
the
brain
but
before
they
can
seize
upon
you
the
antidote
repels
them
that
i
am
sure
is
what
the
charm
has
done
for
us
it
is
nothing
magical
it
is
simply
natural
i
should
have
been
happier
if
i
could
have
quite
agreed
with
carmilla
but
i
did
my
best
and
the
impression
was
a
little
losing
its
force
for
some
nights
i
slept
profoundly
but
still
every
morning
i
felt
the
same
lassitude
and
a
languor
weighed
upon
me
all
day
i
felt
myself
a
changed
girl
a
strange
melancholy
was
stealing
over
me
a
melancholy
that
i
would
not
have
interrupted
dim
thoughts
of
death
began
to
open
and
an
idea
that
i
was
slowly
sinking
took
gentle
and
somehow
not
unwelcome
possession
of
me
if
it
was
sad
the
tone
of
mind
which
this
induced
was
also
sweet
whatever
it
might
be
my
soul
acquiesced
in
it
i
would
not
admit
that
i
was
ill
i
would
not
consent
to
tell
my
papa
or
to
have
the
doctor
sent
for
carmilla
became
more
devoted
to
me
than
ever
and
her
strange
paroxysms
of
languid
adoration
more
frequent
she
used
to
gloat
on
me
with
increasing
ardor
the
more
my
strength
and
spirits
waned
this
always
shocked
me
like
a
momentary
glare
of
insanity
without
knowing
it
i
was
now
in
a
pretty
advanced
stage
of
the
strangest
illness
under
which
mortal
ever
suffered
there
was
an
unaccountable
fascination
in
its
earlier
symptoms
that
more
than
reconciled
me
to
the
incapacitating
effect
of
that
stage
of
the
malady
this
fascination
increased
for
a
time
until
it
reached
a
certain
point
when
gradually
a
sense
of
the
horrible
mingled
itself
with
it
deepening
as
you
shall
hear
until
it
discolored
and
perverted
the
whole
state
of
my
life
the
first
change
i
experienced
was
rather
agreeable
it
was
very
near
the
turning
point
from
which
began
the
descent
of
avernus
certain
vague
and
strange
sensations
visited
me
in
my
sleep
the
prevailing
one
was
of
that
pleasant
peculiar
cold
thrill
which
we
feel
in
bathing
when
we
move
against
the
current
of
a
river
this
was
soon
accompanied
by
dreams
that
seemed
interminable
and
were
so
vague
that
i
could
never
recollect
their
scenery
and
persons
or
any
one
connected
portion
of
their
action
but
they
left
an
awful
impression
and
a
sense
of
exhaustion
as
if
i
had
passed
through
a
long
period
of
great
mental
exertion
and
danger
after
all
these
dreams
there
remained
on
waking
a
remembrance
of
having
been
in
a
place
very
nearly
dark
and
of
having
spoken
to
people
whom
i
could
not
see
and
especially
of
one
clear
voice
of
a
female's
very
deep
that
spoke
as
if
at
a
distance
slowly
and
producing
always
the
same
sensation
of
indescribable
solemnity
and
fear
sometimes
there
came
a
sensation
as
if
a
hand
was
drawn
softly
along
my
cheek
and
neck
sometimes
it
was
as
if
warm
lips
kissed
me
and
longer
and
longer
and
more
lovingly
as
they
reached
my
throat
but
there
the
caress
fixed
itself
my
heart
beat
faster
my
breathing
rose
and
fell
rapidly
and
full
drawn
a
sobbing
that
rose
into
a
sense
of
strangulation
supervened
and
turned
into
a
dreadful
convulsion
in
which
my
senses
left
me
and
i
became
unconscious
it
was
now
three
weeks
since
the
commencement
of
this
unaccountable
state
my
sufferings
had
during
the
last
week
told
upon
my
appearance
i
had
grown
pale
my
eyes
were
dilated
and
darkened
underneath
and
the
languor
which
i
had
long
felt
began
to
display
itself
in
my
countenance
my
father
asked
me
often
whether
i
was
ill
but
with
an
obstinacy
which
now
seems
to
me
unaccountable
i
persisted
in
assuring
him
that
i
was
quite
well
in
a
sense
this
was
true
i
had
no
pain
i
could
complain
of
no
bodily
derangement
my
complaint
seemed
to
be
one
of
the
imagination
or
the
nerves
and
horrible
as
my
sufferings
were
i
kept
them
with
a
morbid
reserve
very
nearly
to
myself
it
could
not
be
that
terrible
complaint
which
the
peasants
called
the
oupire
for
i
had
now
been
suffering
for
three
weeks
and
they
were
seldom
ill
for
much
more
than
three
days
when
death
put
an
end
to
their
miseries
carmilla
complained
of
dreams
and
feverish
sensations
but
by
no
means
of
so
alarming
a
kind
as
mine
i
say
that
mine
were
extremely
alarming
had
i
been
capable
of
comprehending
my
condition
i
would
have
invoked
aid
and
advice
on
my
knees
the
narcotic
of
an
unsuspected
influence
was
acting
upon
me
and
my
perceptions
were
benumbed
i
am
going
to
tell
you
now
of
a
dream
that
led
immediately
to
an
odd
discovery
one
night
instead
of
the
voice
i
was
accustomed
to
hear
in
the
dark
i
heard
one
sweet
and
tender
and
at
the
same
time
terrible
which
said
your
mother
warns
you
to
beware
of
the
assassin
at
the
same
time
a
light
unexpectedly
sprang
up
and
i
saw
carmilla
standing
near
the
foot
of
my
bed
in
her
white
nightdress
bathed
from
her
chin
to
her
feet
in
one
great
stain
of
blood
i
wakened
with
a
shriek
possessed
with
the
one
idea
that
carmilla
was
being
murdered
i
remember
springing
from
my
bed
and
my
next
recollection
is
that
of
standing
on
the
lobby
crying
for
help
madame
and
mademoiselle
came
scurrying
out
of
their
rooms
in
alarm
a
lamp
burned
always
on
the
lobby
and
seeing
me
they
soon
learned
the
cause
of
my
terror
i
insisted
on
our
knocking
at
carmilla's
door
our
knocking
was
unanswered
it
soon
became
a
pounding
and
an
uproar
we
shrieked
her
name
but
all
was
vain
we
all
grew
frightened
for
the
door
was
locked
we
hurried
back
in
panic
to
my
room
there
we
rang
the
bell
long
and
furiously
if
my
father's
room
had
been
at
that
side
of
the
house
we
would
have
called
him
up
at
once
to
our
aid
but
alas
he
was
quite
out
of
hearing
and
to
reach
him
involved
an
excursion
for
which
we
none
of
us
had
courage
servants
however
soon
came
running
up
the
stairs
i
had
got
on
my
dressing
gown
and
slippers
meanwhile
and
my
companions
were
already
similarly
furnished
recognizing
the
voices
of
the
servants
on
the
lobby
we
sallied
out
together
and
having
renewed
as
fruitlessly
our
summons
at
carmilla's
door
i
ordered
the
men
to
force
the
lock
they
did
so
and
we
stood
holding
our
lights
aloft
in
the
doorway
and
so
stared
into
the
room
we
called
her
by
name
but
there
was
still
no
reply
we
looked
round
the
room
everything
was
undisturbed
it
was
exactly
in
the
state
in
which
i
had
left
it
on
bidding
her
good
night
but
carmilla
was
gone
viii
search
at
sight
of
the
room
perfectly
undisturbed
except
for
our
violent
entrance
we
began
to
cool
a
little
and
soon
recovered
our
senses
sufficiently
to
dismiss
the
men
it
had
struck
mademoiselle
that
possibly
carmilla
had
been
wakened
by
the
uproar
at
her
door
and
in
her
first
panic
had
jumped
from
her
bed
and
hid
herself
in
a
press
or
behind
a
curtain
from
which
she
could
not
of
course
emerge
until
the
majordomo
and
his
myrmidons
had
withdrawn
we
now
recommenced
our
search
and
began
to
call
her
name
again
it
was
all
to
no
purpose
our
perplexity
and
agitation
increased
we
examined
the
windows
but
they
were
secured
i
implored
of
carmilla
if
she
had
concealed
herself
to
play
this
cruel
trick
no
longer--to
come
out
and
to
end
our
anxieties
it
was
all
useless
i
was
by
this
time
convinced
that
she
was
not
in
the
room
nor
in
the
dressing
room
the
door
of
which
was
still
locked
on
this
side
she
could
not
have
passed
it
i
was
utterly
puzzled
had
carmilla
discovered
one
of
those
secret
passages
which
the
old
housekeeper
said
were
known
to
exist
in
the
schloss
although
the
tradition
of
their
exact
situation
had
been
lost
a
little
time
would
no
doubt
explain
all--utterly
perplexed
as
for
the
present
we
were
it
was
past
four
o'clock
and
i
preferred
passing
the
remaining
hours
of
darkness
in
madame's
room
daylight
brought
no
solution
of
the
difficulty
the
whole
household
with
my
father
at
its
head
was
in
a
state
of
agitation
next
morning
every
part
of
the
chateau
was
searched
the
grounds
were
explored
no
trace
of
the
missing
lady
could
be
discovered
the
stream
was
about
to
be
dragged
my
father
was
in
distraction
what
a
tale
to
have
to
tell
the
poor
girl's
mother
on
her
return
i
too
was
almost
beside
myself
though
my
grief
was
quite
of
a
different
kind
the
morning
was
passed
in
alarm
and
excitement
it
was
now
one
o'clock
and
still
no
tidings
i
ran
up
to
carmilla's
room
and
found
her
standing
at
her
dressing
table
i
was
astounded
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
she
beckoned
me
to
her
with
her
pretty
finger
in
silence
her
face
expressed
extreme
fear
i
ran
to
her
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
i
kissed
and
embraced
her
again
and
again
i
ran
to
the
bell
and
rang
it
vehemently
to
bring
others
to
the
spot
who
might
at
once
relieve
my
father's
anxiety
dear
carmilla
what
has
become
of
you
all
this
time
we
have
been
in
agonies
of
anxiety
about
you
i
exclaimed
where
have
you
been
how
did
you
come
back
last
night
has
been
a
night
of
wonders
she
said
for
mercy's
sake
explain
all
you
can
it
was
past
two
last
night
she
said
when
i
went
to
sleep
as
usual
in
my
bed
with
my
doors
locked
that
of
the
dressing
room
and
that
opening
upon
the
gallery
my
sleep
was
uninterrupted
and
so
far
as
i
know
dreamless
but
i
woke
just
now
on
the
sofa
in
the
dressing
room
there
and
i
found
the
door
between
the
rooms
open
and
the
other
door
forced
how
could
all
this
have
happened
without
my
being
wakened
it
must
have
been
accompanied
with
a
great
deal
of
noise
and
i
am
particularly
easily
wakened
and
how
could
i
have
been
carried
out
of
my
bed
without
my
sleep
having
been
interrupted
i
whom
the
slightest
stir
startles
by
this
time
madame
mademoiselle
my
father
and
a
number
of
the
servants
were
in
the
room
carmilla
was
of
course
overwhelmed
with
inquiries
congratulations
and
welcomes
she
had
but
one
story
to
tell
and
seemed
the
least
able
of
all
the
party
to
suggest
any
way
of
accounting
for
what
had
happened
my
father
took
a
turn
up
and
down
the
room
thinking
i
saw
carmilla's
eye
follow
him
for
a
moment
with
a
sly
dark
glance
when
my
father
had
sent
the
servants
away
mademoiselle
having
gone
in
search
of
a
little
bottle
of
valerian
and
salvolatile
and
there
being
no
one
now
in
the
room
with
carmilla
except
my
father
madame
and
myself
he
came
to
her
thoughtfully
took
her
hand
very
kindly
led
her
to
the
sofa
and
sat
down
beside
her
will
you
forgive
me
my
dear
if
i
risk
a
conjecture
and
ask
a
question
who
can
have
a
better
right
she
said
ask
what
you
please
and
i
will
tell
you
everything
but
my
story
is
simply
one
of
bewilderment
and
darkness
i
know
absolutely
nothing
put
any
question
you
please
but
you
know
of
course
the
limitations
mamma
has
placed
me
under
perfectly
my
dear
child
i
need
not
approach
the
topics
on
which
she
desires
our
silence
now
the
marvel
of
last
night
consists
in
your
having
been
removed
from
your
bed
and
your
room
without
being
wakened
and
this
removal
having
occurred
apparently
while
the
windows
were
still
secured
and
the
two
doors
locked
upon
the
inside
i
will
tell
you
my
theory
and
ask
you
a
question
carmilla
was
leaning
on
her
hand
dejectedly
madame
and
i
were
listening
breathlessly
now
my
question
is
this
have
you
ever
been
suspected
of
walking
in
your
sleep
never
since
i
was
very
young
indeed
but
you
did
walk
in
your
sleep
when
you
were
young
yes
i
know
i
did
i
have
been
told
so
often
by
my
old
nurse
my
father
smiled
and
nodded
well
what
has
happened
is
this
you
got
up
in
your
sleep
unlocked
the
door
not
leaving
the
key
as
usual
in
the
lock
but
taking
it
out
and
locking
it
on
the
outside
you
again
took
the
key
out
and
carried
it
away
with
you
to
some
one
of
the
five-and-twenty
rooms
on
this
floor
or
perhaps
upstairs
or
downstairs
there
are
so
many
rooms
and
closets
so
much
heavy
furniture
and
such
accumulations
of
lumber
that
it
would
require
a
week
to
search
this
old
house
thoroughly
do
you
see
now
what
i
mean
i
do
but
not
all
she
answered
and
how
papa
do
you
account
for
her
finding
herself
on
the
sofa
in
the
dressing
room
which
we
had
searched
so
carefully
she
came
there
after
you
had
searched
it
still
in
her
sleep
and
at
last
awoke
spontaneously
and
was
as
much
surprised
to
find
herself
where
she
was
as
any
one
else
i
wish
all
mysteries
were
as
easily
and
innocently
explained
as
yours
carmilla
he
said
laughing
and
so
we
may
congratulate
ourselves
on
the
certainty
that
the
most
natural
explanation
of
the
occurrence
is
one
that
involves
no
drugging
no
tampering
with
locks
no
burglars
or
poisoners
or
witches--nothing
that
need
alarm
carmilla
or
anyone
else
for
our
safety
carmilla
was
looking
charmingly
nothing
could
be
more
beautiful
than
her
tints
her
beauty
was
i
think
enhanced
by
that
graceful
languor
that
was
peculiar
to
her
i
think
my
father
was
silently
contrasting
her
looks
with
mine
for
he
said
i
wish
my
poor
laura
was
looking
more
like
herself
and
he
sighed
so
our
alarms
were
happily
ended
and
carmilla
restored
to
her
friends
ix
the
doctor
as
carmilla
would
not
hear
of
an
attendant
sleeping
in
her
room
my
father
arranged
that
a
servant
should
sleep
outside
her
door
so
that
she
would
not
attempt
to
make
another
such
excursion
without
being
arrested
at
her
own
door
that
night
passed
quietly
and
next
morning
early
the
doctor
whom
my
father
had
sent
for
without
telling
me
a
word
about
it
arrived
to
see
me
madame
accompanied
me
to
the
library
and
there
the
grave
little
doctor
with
white
hair
and
spectacles
whom
i
mentioned
before
was
waiting
to
receive
me
i
told
him
my
story
and
as
i
proceeded
he
grew
graver
and
graver
we
were
standing
he
and
i
in
the
recess
of
one
of
the
windows
facing
one
another
when
my
statement
was
over
he
leaned
with
his
shoulders
against
the
wall
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
me
earnestly
with
an
interest
in
which
was
a
dash
of
horror
after
a
minute's
reflection
he
asked
madame
if
he
could
see
my
father
he
was
sent
for
accordingly
and
as
he
entered
smiling
he
said
i
dare
say
doctor
you
are
going
to
tell
me
that
i
am
an
old
fool
for
having
brought
you
here
i
hope
i
am
but
his
smile
faded
into
shadow
as
the
doctor
with
a
very
grave
face
beckoned
him
to
him
he
and
the
doctor
talked
for
some
time
in
the
same
recess
where
i
had
just
conferred
with
the
physician
it
seemed
an
earnest
and
argumentative
conversation
the
room
is
very
large
and
i
and
madame
stood
together
burning
with
curiosity
at
the
farther
end
not
a
word
could
we
hear
however
for
they
spoke
in
a
very
low
tone
and
the
deep
recess
of
the
window
quite
concealed
the
doctor
from
view
and
very
nearly
my
father
whose
foot
arm
and
shoulder
only
could
we
see
and
the
voices
were
i
suppose
all
the
less
audible
for
the
sort
of
closet
which
the
thick
wall
and
window
formed
after
a
time
my
father's
face
looked
into
the
room
it
was
pale
thoughtful
and
i
fancied
agitated
laura
dear
come
here
for
a
moment
madame
we
shan't
trouble
you
the
doctor
says
at
present
accordingly
i
approached
for
the
first
time
a
little
alarmed
for
although
i
felt
very
weak
i
did
not
feel
ill
and
strength
one
always
fancies
is
a
thing
that
may
be
picked
up
when
we
please
my
father
held
out
his
hand
to
me
as
i
drew
near
but
he
was
looking
at
the
doctor
and
he
said
it
certainly
is
very
odd
i
don't
understand
it
quite
laura
come
here
dear
now
attend
to
doctor
spielsberg
and
recollect
yourself
you
mentioned
a
sensation
like
that
of
two
needles
piercing
the
skin
somewhere
about
your
neck
on
the
night
when
you
experienced
your
first
horrible
dream
is
there
still
any
soreness
none
at
all
i
answered
can
you
indicate
with
your
finger
about
the
point
at
which
you
think
this
occurred
very
little
below
my
throat--here
i
answered
i
wore
a
morning
dress
which
covered
the
place
i
pointed
to
now
you
can
satisfy
yourself
said
the
doctor
you
won't
mind
your
papa's
lowering
your
dress
a
very
little
it
is
necessary
to
detect
a
symptom
of
the
complaint
under
which
you
have
been
suffering
i
acquiesced
it
was
only
an
inch
or
two
below
the
edge
of
my
collar
god
bless
me--so
it
is
exclaimed
my
father
growing
pale
you
see
it
now
with
your
own
eyes
said
the
doctor
with
a
gloomy
triumph
what
is
it
i
exclaimed
beginning
to
be
frightened
nothing
my
dear
young
lady
but
a
small
blue
spot
about
the
size
of
the
tip
of
your
little
finger
and
now
he
continued
turning
to
papa
the
question
is
what
is
best
to
be
done
is
there
any
danger
i
urged
in
great
trepidation
i
trust
not
my
dear
answered
the
doctor
i
don't
see
why
you
should
not
recover
i
don't
see
why
you
should
not
begin
immediately
to
get
better
that
is
the
point
at
which
the
sense
of
strangulation
begins
yes
i
answered
and--recollect
as
well
as
you
can--the
same
point
was
a
kind
of
center
of
that
thrill
which
you
described
just
now
like
the
current
of
a
cold
stream
running
against
you
it
may
have
been
i
think
it
was
ay
you
see
he
added
turning
to
my
father
shall
i
say
a
word
to
madame
certainly
said
my
father
he
called
madame
to
him
and
said
i
find
my
young
friend
here
far
from
well
it
won't
be
of
any
great
consequence
i
hope
but
it
will
be
necessary
that
some
steps
be
taken
which
i
will
explain
by-and-by
but
in
the
meantime
madame
you
will
be
so
good
as
not
to
let
miss
laura
be
alone
for
one
moment
that
is
the
only
direction
i
need
give
for
the
present
it
is
indispensable
we
may
rely
upon
your
kindness
madame
i
know
added
my
father
madame
satisfied
him
eagerly
and
you
dear
laura
i
know
you
will
observe
the
doctor's
direction
i
shall
have
to
ask
your
opinion
upon
another
patient
whose
symptoms
slightly
resemble
those
of
my
daughter
that
have
just
been
detailed
to
you--very
much
milder
in
degree
but
i
believe
quite
of
the
same
sort
she
is
a
young
lady--our
guest
but
as
you
say
you
will
be
passing
this
way
again
this
evening
you
can't
do
better
than
take
your
supper
here
and
you
can
then
see
her
she
does
not
come
down
till
the
afternoon
i
thank
you
said
the
doctor
i
shall
be
with
you
then
at
about
seven
this
evening
and
then
they
repeated
their
directions
to
me
and
to
madame
and
with
this
parting
charge
my
father
left
us
and
walked
out
with
the
doctor
and
i
saw
them
pacing
together
up
and
down
between
the
road
and
the
moat
on
the
grassy
platform
in
front
of
the
castle
evidently
absorbed
in
earnest
conversation
the
doctor
did
not
return
i
saw
him
mount
his
horse
there
take
his
leave
and
ride
away
eastward
through
the
forest
nearly
at
the
same
time
i
saw
the
man
arrive
from
dranfield
with
the
letters
and
dismount
and
hand
the
bag
to
my
father
in
the
meantime
madame
and
i
were
both
busy
lost
in
conjecture
as
to
the
reasons
of
the
singular
and
earnest
direction
which
the
doctor
and
my
father
had
concurred
in
imposing
madame
as
she
afterwards
told
me
was
afraid
the
doctor
apprehended
a
sudden
seizure
and
that
without
prompt
assistance
i
might
either
lose
my
life
in
a
fit
or
at
least
be
seriously
hurt
the
interpretation
did
not
strike
me
and
i
fancied
perhaps
luckily
for
my
nerves
that
the
arrangement
was
prescribed
simply
to
secure
a
companion
who
would
prevent
my
taking
too
much
exercise
or
eating
unripe
fruit
or
doing
any
of
the
fifty
foolish
things
to
which
young
people
are
supposed
to
be
prone
about
half
an
hour
after
my
father
came
in--he
had
a
letter
in
his
hand--and
said
this
letter
had
been
delayed
it
is
from
general
spielsdorf
he
might
have
been
here
yesterday
he
may
not
come
till
tomorrow
or
he
may
be
here
today
he
put
the
open
letter
into
my
hand
but
he
did
not
look
pleased
as
he
used
when
a
guest
especially
one
so
much
loved
as
the
general
was
coming
on
the
contrary
he
looked
as
if
he
wished
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
red
sea
there
was
plainly
something
on
his
mind
which
he
did
not
choose
to
divulge
papa
darling
will
you
tell
me
this
said
i
suddenly
laying
my
hand
on
his
arm
and
looking
i
am
sure
imploringly
in
his
face
perhaps
he
answered
smoothing
my
hair
caressingly
over
my
eyes
does
the
doctor
think
me
very
ill
no
dear
he
thinks
if
right
steps
are
taken
you
will
be
quite
well
again
at
least
on
the
high
road
to
a
complete
recovery
in
a
day
or
two
he
answered
a
little
dryly
i
wish
our
good
friend
the
general
had
chosen
any
other
time
that
is
i
wish
you
had
been
perfectly
well
to
receive
him
but
do
tell
me
papa
i
insisted
what
does
he
think
is
the
matter
with
me
nothing
you
must
not
plague
me
with
questions
he
answered
with
more
irritation
than
i
ever
remember
him
to
have
displayed
before
and
seeing
that
i
looked
wounded
i
suppose
he
kissed
me
and
added
you
shall
know
all
about
it
in
a
day
or
two
that
is
all
that
i
know
in
the
meantime
you
are
not
to
trouble
your
head
about
it
he
turned
and
left
the
room
but
came
back
before
i
had
done
wondering
and
puzzling
over
the
oddity
of
all
this
it
was
merely
to
say
that
he
was
going
to
karnstein
and
had
ordered
the
carriage
to
be
ready
at
twelve
and
that
i
and
madame
should
accompany
him
he
was
going
to
see
the
priest
who
lived
near
those
picturesque
grounds
upon
business
and
as
carmilla
had
never
seen
them
she
could
follow
when
she
came
down
with
mademoiselle
who
would
bring
materials
for
what
you
call
a
picnic
which
might
be
laid
for
us
in
the
ruined
castle
at
twelve
o'clock
accordingly
i
was
ready
and
not
long
after
my
father
madame
and
i
set
out
upon
our
projected
drive
passing
the
drawbridge
we
turn
to
the
right
and
follow
the
road
over
the
steep
gothic
bridge
westward
to
reach
the
deserted
village
and
ruined
castle
of
karnstein
no
sylvan
drive
can
be
fancied
prettier
the
ground
breaks
into
gentle
hills
and
hollows
all
clothed
with
beautiful
wood
totally
destitute
of
the
comparative
formality
which
artificial
planting
and
early
culture
and
pruning
impart
the
irregularities
of
the
ground
often
lead
the
road
out
of
its
course
and
cause
it
to
wind
beautifully
round
the
sides
of
broken
hollows
and
the
steeper
sides
of
the
hills
among
varieties
of
ground
almost
inexhaustible
turning
one
of
these
points
we
suddenly
encountered
our
old
friend
the
general
riding
towards
us
attended
by
a
mounted
servant
his
portmanteaus
were
following
in
a
hired
wagon
such
as
we
term
a
cart
the
general
dismounted
as
we
pulled
up
and
after
the
usual
greetings
was
easily
persuaded
to
accept
the
vacant
seat
in
the
carriage
and
send
his
horse
on
with
his
servant
to
the
schloss
x
bereaved
it
was
about
ten
months
since
we
had
last
seen
him
but
that
time
had
sufficed
to
make
an
alteration
of
years
in
his
appearance
he
had
grown
thinner
something
of
gloom
and
anxiety
had
taken
the
place
of
that
cordial
serenity
which
used
to
characterize
his
features
his
dark
blue
eyes
always
penetrating
now
gleamed
with
a
sterner
light
from
under
his
shaggy
grey
eyebrows
it
was
not
such
a
change
as
grief
alone
usually
induces
and
angrier
passions
seemed
to
have
had
their
share
in
bringing
it
about
we
had
not
long
resumed
our
drive
when
the
general
began
to
talk
with
his
usual
soldierly
directness
of
the
bereavement
as
he
termed
it
which
he
had
sustained
in
the
death
of
his
beloved
niece
and
ward
and
he
then
broke
out
in
a
tone
of
intense
bitterness
and
fury
inveighing
against
the
hellish
arts
to
which
she
had
fallen
a
victim
and
expressing
with
more
exasperation
than
piety
his
wonder
that
heaven
should
tolerate
so
monstrous
an
indulgence
of
the
lusts
and
malignity
of
hell
my
father
who
saw
at
once
that
something
very
extraordinary
had
befallen
asked
him
if
not
too
painful
to
him
to
detail
the
circumstances
which
he
thought
justified
the
strong
terms
in
which
he
expressed
himself
i
should
tell
you
all
with
pleasure
said
the
general
but
you
would
not
believe
me
why
should
i
not
he
asked
because
he
answered
testily
you
believe
in
nothing
but
what
consists
with
your
own
prejudices
and
illusions
i
remember
when
i
was
like
you
but
i
have
learned
better
try
me
said
my
father
i
am
not
such
a
dogmatist
as
you
suppose
besides
which
i
very
well
know
that
you
generally
require
proof
for
what
you
believe
and
am
therefore
very
strongly
predisposed
to
respect
your
conclusions
you
are
right
in
supposing
that
i
have
not
been
led
lightly
into
a
belief
in
the
marvelous--for
what
i
have
experienced
is
marvelous--and
i
have
been
forced
by
extraordinary
evidence
to
credit
that
which
ran
counter
diametrically
to
all
my
theories
i
have
been
made
the
dupe
of
a
preternatural
conspiracy
notwithstanding
his
professions
of
confidence
in
the
general's
penetration
i
saw
my
father
at
this
point
glance
at
the
general
with
as
i
thought
a
marked
suspicion
of
his
sanity
the
general
did
not
see
it
luckily
he
was
looking
gloomily
and
curiously
into
the
glades
and
vistas
of
the
woods
that
were
opening
before
us
you
are
going
to
the
ruins
of
karnstein
he
said
yes
it
is
a
lucky
coincidence
do
you
know
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
bring
me
there
to
inspect
them
i
have
a
special
object
in
exploring
there
is
a
ruined
chapel
ain't
there
with
a
great
many
tombs
of
that
extinct
family
so
there
are--highly
interesting
said
my
father
i
hope
you
are
thinking
of
claiming
the
title
and
estates
my
father
said
this
gaily
but
the
general
did
not
recollect
the
laugh
or
even
the
smile
which
courtesy
exacts
for
a
friend's
joke
on
the
contrary
he
looked
grave
and
even
fierce
ruminating
on
a
matter
that
stirred
his
anger
and
horror
something
very
different
he
said
gruffly
i
mean
to
unearth
some
of
those
fine
people
i
hope
by
god's
blessing
to
accomplish
a
pious
sacrilege
here
which
will
relieve
our
earth
of
certain
monsters
and
enable
honest
people
to
sleep
in
their
beds
without
being
assailed
by
murderers
i
have
strange
things
to
tell
you
my
dear
friend
such
as
i
myself
would
have
scouted
as
incredible
a
few
months
since
my
father
looked
at
him
again
but
this
time
not
with
a
glance
of
suspicion--with
an
eye
rather
of
keen
intelligence
and
alarm
the
house
of
karnstein
he
said
has
been
long
extinct
a
hundred
years
at
least
my
dear
wife
was
maternally
descended
from
the
karnsteins
but
the
name
and
title
have
long
ceased
to
exist
the
castle
is
a
ruin
the
very
village
is
deserted
it
is
fifty
years
since
the
smoke
of
a
chimney
was
seen
there
not
a
roof
left
quite
true
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
that
since
i
last
saw
you
a
great
deal
that
will
astonish
you
but
i
had
better
relate
everything
in
the
order
in
which
it
occurred
said
the
general
you
saw
my
dear
ward--my
child
i
may
call
her
no
creature
could
have
been
more
beautiful
and
only
three
months
ago
none
more
blooming
yes
poor
thing
when
i
saw
her
last
she
certainly
was
quite
lovely
said
my
father
i
was
grieved
and
shocked
more
than
i
can
tell
you
my
dear
friend
i
knew
what
a
blow
it
was
to
you
he
took
the
general's
hand
and
they
exchanged
a
kind
pressure
tears
gathered
in
the
old
soldier's
eyes
he
did
not
seek
to
conceal
them
he
said
we
have
been
very
old
friends
i
knew
you
would
feel
for
me
childless
as
i
am
she
had
become
an
object
of
very
near
interest
to
me
and
repaid
my
care
by
an
affection
that
cheered
my
home
and
made
my
life
happy
that
is
all
gone
the
years
that
remain
to
me
on
earth
may
not
be
very
long
but
by
god's
mercy
i
hope
to
accomplish
a
service
to
mankind
before
i
die
and
to
subserve
the
vengeance
of
heaven
upon
the
fiends
who
have
murdered
my
poor
child
in
the
spring
of
her
hopes
and
beauty
you
said
just
now
that
you
intended
relating
everything
as
it
occurred
said
my
father
pray
do
i
assure
you
that
it
is
not
mere
curiosity
that
prompts
me
by
this
time
we
had
reached
the
point
at
which
the
drunstall
road
by
which
the
general
had
come
diverges
from
the
road
which
we
were
traveling
to
karnstein
how
far
is
it
to
the
ruins
inquired
the
general
looking
anxiously
forward
about
half
a
league
answered
my
father
pray
let
us
hear
the
story
you
were
so
good
as
to
promise
xi
the
story
with
all
my
heart
said
the
general
with
an
effort
and
after
a
short
pause
in
which
to
arrange
his
subject
he
commenced
one
of
the
strangest
narratives
i
ever
heard
my
dear
child
was
looking
forward
with
great
pleasure
to
the
visit
you
had
been
so
good
as
to
arrange
for
her
to
your
charming
daughter
here
he
made
me
a
gallant
but
melancholy
bow
in
the
meantime
we
had
an
invitation
to
my
old
friend
the
count
carlsfeld
whose
schloss
is
about
six
leagues
to
the
other
side
of
karnstein
it
was
to
attend
the
series
of
fetes
which
you
remember
were
given
by
him
in
honor
of
his
illustrious
visitor
the
grand
duke
charles
yes
and
very
splendid
i
believe
they
were
said
my
father
princely
but
then
his
hospitalities
are
quite
regal
he
has
aladdin's
lamp
the
night
from
which
my
sorrow
dates
was
devoted
to
a
magnificent
masquerade
the
grounds
were
thrown
open
the
trees
hung
with
colored
lamps
there
was
such
a
display
of
fireworks
as
paris
itself
had
never
witnessed
and
such
music--music
you
know
is
my
weakness--such
ravishing
music
the
finest
instrumental
band
perhaps
in
the
world
and
the
finest
singers
who
could
be
collected
from
all
the
great
operas
in
europe
as
you
wandered
through
these
fantastically
illuminated
grounds
the
moon-lighted
chateau
throwing
a
rosy
light
from
its
long
rows
of
windows
you
would
suddenly
hear
these
ravishing
voices
stealing
from
the
silence
of
some
grove
or
rising
from
boats
upon
the
lake
i
felt
myself
as
i
looked
and
listened
carried
back
into
the
romance
and
poetry
of
my
early
youth
when
the
fireworks
were
ended
and
the
ball
beginning
we
returned
to
the
noble
suite
of
rooms
that
were
thrown
open
to
the
dancers
a
masked
ball
you
know
is
a
beautiful
sight
but
so
brilliant
a
spectacle
of
the
kind
i
never
saw
before
it
was
a
very
aristocratic
assembly
i
was
myself
almost
the
only
'nobody'
present
my
dear
child
was
looking
quite
beautiful
she
wore
no
mask
her
excitement
and
delight
added
an
unspeakable
charm
to
her
features
always
lovely
i
remarked
a
young
lady
dressed
magnificently
but
wearing
a
mask
who
appeared
to
me
to
be
observing
my
ward
with
extraordinary
interest
i
had
seen
her
earlier
in
the
evening
in
the
great
hall
and
again
for
a
few
minutes
walking
near
us
on
the
terrace
under
the
castle
windows
similarly
employed
a
lady
also
masked
richly
and
gravely
dressed
and
with
a
stately
air
like
a
person
of
rank
accompanied
her
as
a
chaperon
had
the
young
lady
not
worn
a
mask
i
could
of
course
have
been
much
more
certain
upon
the
question
whether
she
was
really
watching
my
poor
darling
i
am
now
well
assured
that
she
was
we
were
now
in
one
of
the
salons
my
poor
dear
child
had
been
dancing
and
was
resting
a
little
in
one
of
the
chairs
near
the
door
i
was
standing
near
the
two
ladies
i
have
mentioned
had
approached
and
the
younger
took
the
chair
next
my
ward
while
her
companion
stood
beside
me
and
for
a
little
time
addressed
herself
in
a
low
tone
to
her
charge
availing
herself
of
the
privilege
of
her
mask
she
turned
to
me
and
in
the
tone
of
an
old
friend
and
calling
me
by
my
name
opened
a
conversation
with
me
which
piqued
my
curiosity
a
good
deal
she
referred
to
many
scenes
where
she
had
met
me--at
court
and
at
distinguished
houses
she
alluded
to
little
incidents
which
i
had
long
ceased
to
think
of
but
which
i
found
had
only
lain
in
abeyance
in
my
memory
for
they
instantly
started
into
life
at
her
touch
i
became
more
and
more
curious
to
ascertain
who
she
was
every
moment
she
parried
my
attempts
to
discover
very
adroitly
and
pleasantly
the
knowledge
she
showed
of
many
passages
in
my
life
seemed
to
me
all
but
unaccountable
and
she
appeared
to
take
a
not
unnatural
pleasure
in
foiling
my
curiosity
and
in
seeing
me
flounder
in
my
eager
perplexity
from
one
conjecture
to
another
in
the
meantime
the
young
lady
whom
her
mother
called
by
the
odd
name
of
millarca
when
she
once
or
twice
addressed
her
had
with
the
same
ease
and
grace
got
into
conversation
with
my
ward
she
introduced
herself
by
saying
that
her
mother
was
a
very
old
acquaintance
of
mine
she
spoke
of
the
agreeable
audacity
which
a
mask
rendered
practicable
she
talked
like
a
friend
she
admired
her
dress
and
insinuated
very
prettily
her
admiration
of
her
beauty
she
amused
her
with
laughing
criticisms
upon
the
people
who
crowded
the
ballroom
and
laughed
at
my
poor
child's
fun
she
was
very
witty
and
lively
when
she
pleased
and
after
a
time
they
had
grown
very
good
friends
and
the
young
stranger
lowered
her
mask
displaying
a
remarkably
beautiful
face
i
had
never
seen
it
before
neither
had
my
dear
child
but
though
it
was
new
to
us
the
features
were
so
engaging
as
well
as
lovely
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
the
attraction
powerfully
my
poor
girl
did
so
i
never
saw
anyone
more
taken
with
another
at
first
sight
unless
indeed
it
was
the
stranger
herself
who
seemed
quite
to
have
lost
her
heart
to
her
in
the
meantime
availing
myself
of
the
license
of
a
masquerade
i
put
not
a
few
questions
to
the
elder
lady
'you
have
puzzled
me
utterly'
i
said
laughing
'is
that
not
enough
won't
you
now
consent
to
stand
on
equal
terms
and
do
me
the
kindness
to
remove
your
mask'
'can
any
request
be
more
unreasonable'
she
replied
'ask
a
lady
to
yield
an
advantage
beside
how
do
you
know
you
should
recognize
me
years
make
changes'
'as
you
see'
i
said
with
a
bow
and
i
suppose
a
rather
melancholy
little
laugh
'as
philosophers
tell
us'
she
said
'and
how
do
you
know
that
a
sight
of
my
face
would
help
you'
'i
should
take
chance
for
that'
i
answered
'it
is
vain
trying
to
make
yourself
out
an
old
woman
your
figure
betrays
you'
'years
nevertheless
have
passed
since
i
saw
you
rather
since
you
saw
me
for
that
is
what
i
am
considering
millarca
there
is
my
daughter
i
cannot
then
be
young
even
in
the
opinion
of
people
whom
time
has
taught
to
be
indulgent
and
i
may
not
like
to
be
compared
with
what
you
remember
me
you
have
no
mask
to
remove
you
can
offer
me
nothing
in
exchange'
'my
petition
is
to
your
pity
to
remove
it'
'and
mine
to
yours
to
let
it
stay
where
it
is'
she
replied
'well
then
at
least
you
will
tell
me
whether
you
are
french
or
german
you
speak
both
languages
so
perfectly'
'i
don't
think
i
shall
tell
you
that
general
you
intend
a
surprise
and
are
meditating
the
particular
point
of
attack'
'at
all
events
you
won't
deny
this'
i
said
'that
being
honored
by
your
permission
to
converse
i
ought
to
know
how
to
address
you
shall
i
say
madame
la
comtesse'
she
laughed
and
she
would
no
doubt
have
met
me
with
another
evasion--if
indeed
i
can
treat
any
occurrence
in
an
interview
every
circumstance
of
which
was
prearranged
as
i
now
believe
with
the
profoundest
cunning
as
liable
to
be
modified
by
accident
'as
to
that'
she
began
but
she
was
interrupted
almost
as
she
opened
her
lips
by
a
gentleman
dressed
in
black
who
looked
particularly
elegant
and
distinguished
with
this
drawback
that
his
face
was
the
most
deadly
pale
i
ever
saw
except
in
death
he
was
in
no
masquerade--in
the
plain
evening
dress
of
a
gentleman
and
he
said
without
a
smile
but
with
a
courtly
and
unusually
low
bow--
'will
madame
la
comtesse
permit
me
to
say
a
very
few
words
which
may
interest
her'
the
lady
turned
quickly
to
him
and
touched
her
lip
in
token
of
silence
she
then
said
to
me
'keep
my
place
for
me
general
i
shall
return
when
i
have
said
a
few
words'
and
with
this
injunction
playfully
given
she
walked
a
little
aside
with
the
gentleman
in
black
and
talked
for
some
minutes
apparently
very
earnestly
they
then
walked
away
slowly
together
in
the
crowd
and
i
lost
them
for
some
minutes
i
spent
the
interval
in
cudgeling
my
brains
for
a
conjecture
as
to
the
identity
of
the
lady
who
seemed
to
remember
me
so
kindly
and
i
was
thinking
of
turning
about
and
joining
in
the
conversation
between
my
pretty
ward
and
the
countess's
daughter
and
trying
whether
by
the
time
she
returned
i
might
not
have
a
surprise
in
store
for
her
by
having
her
name
title
chateau
and
estates
at
my
fingers'
ends
but
at
this
moment
she
returned
accompanied
by
the
pale
man
in
black
who
said
'i
shall
return
and
inform
madame
la
comtesse
when
her
carriage
is
at
the
door'
he
withdrew
with
a
bow
xii
a
petition
'then
we
are
to
lose
madame
la
comtesse
but
i
hope
only
for
a
few
hours'
i
said
with
a
low
bow
'it
may
be
that
only
or
it
may
be
a
few
weeks
it
was
very
unlucky
his
speaking
to
me
just
now
as
he
did
do
you
now
know
me'
i
assured
her
i
did
not
'you
shall
know
me'
she
said
'but
not
at
present
we
are
older
and
better
friends
than
perhaps
you
suspect
i
cannot
yet
declare
myself
i
shall
in
three
weeks
pass
your
beautiful
schloss
about
which
i
have
been
making
enquiries
i
shall
then
look
in
upon
you
for
an
hour
or
two
and
renew
a
friendship
which
i
never
think
of
without
a
thousand
pleasant
recollections
this
moment
a
piece
of
news
has
reached
me
like
a
thunderbolt
i
must
set
out
now
and
travel
by
a
devious
route
nearly
a
hundred
miles
with
all
the
dispatch
i
can
possibly
make
my
perplexities
multiply
i
am
only
deterred
by
the
compulsory
reserve
i
practice
as
to
my
name
from
making
a
very
singular
request
of
you
my
poor
child
has
not
quite
recovered
her
strength
her
horse
fell
with
her
at
a
hunt
which
she
had
ridden
out
to
witness
her
nerves
have
not
yet
recovered
the
shock
and
our
physician
says
that
she
must
on
no
account
exert
herself
for
some
time
to
come
we
came
here
in
consequence
by
very
easy
stages--hardly
six
leagues
a
day
i
must
now
travel
day
and
night
on
a
mission
of
life
and
death--a
mission
the
critical
and
momentous
nature
of
which
i
shall
be
able
to
explain
to
you
when
we
meet
as
i
hope
we
shall
in
a
few
weeks
without
the
necessity
of
any
concealment'
she
went
on
to
make
her
petition
and
it
was
in
the
tone
of
a
person
from
whom
such
a
request
amounted
to
conferring
rather
than
seeking
a
favor
this
was
only
in
manner
and
as
it
seemed
quite
unconsciously
than
the
terms
in
which
it
was
expressed
nothing
could
be
more
deprecatory
it
was
simply
that
i
would
consent
to
take
charge
of
her
daughter
during
her
absence
this
was
all
things
considered
a
strange
not
to
say
an
audacious
request
she
in
some
sort
disarmed
me
by
stating
and
admitting
everything
that
could
be
urged
against
it
and
throwing
herself
entirely
upon
my
chivalry
at
the
same
moment
by
a
fatality
that
seems
to
have
predetermined
all
that
happened
my
poor
child
came
to
my
side
and
in
an
undertone
besought
me
to
invite
her
new
friend
millarca
to
pay
us
a
visit
she
had
just
been
sounding
her
and
thought
if
her
mamma
would
allow
her
she
would
like
it
extremely
at
another
time
i
should
have
told
her
to
wait
a
little
until
at
least
we
knew
who
they
were
but
i
had
not
a
moment
to
think
in
the
two
ladies
assailed
me
together
and
i
must
confess
the
refined
and
beautiful
face
of
the
young
lady
about
which
there
was
something
extremely
engaging
as
well
as
the
elegance
and
fire
of
high
birth
determined
me
and
quite
overpowered
i
submitted
and
undertook
too
easily
the
care
of
the
young
lady
whom
her
mother
called
millarca
the
countess
beckoned
to
her
daughter
who
listened
with
grave
attention
while
she
told
her
in
general
terms
how
suddenly
and
peremptorily
she
had
been
summoned
and
also
of
the
arrangement
she
had
made
for
her
under
my
care
adding
that
i
was
one
of
her
earliest
and
most
valued
friends
i
made
of
course
such
speeches
as
the
case
seemed
to
call
for
and
found
myself
on
reflection
in
a
position
which
i
did
not
half
like
the
gentleman
in
black
returned
and
very
ceremoniously
conducted
the
lady
from
the
room
the
demeanor
of
this
gentleman
was
such
as
to
impress
me
with
the
conviction
that
the
countess
was
a
lady
of
very
much
more
importance
than
her
modest
title
alone
might
have
led
me
to
assume
her
last
charge
to
me
was
that
no
attempt
was
to
be
made
to
learn
more
about
her
than
i
might
have
already
guessed
until
her
return
our
distinguished
host
whose
guest
she
was
knew
her
reasons
'but
here'
she
said
'neither
i
nor
my
daughter
could
safely
remain
for
more
than
a
day
i
removed
my
mask
imprudently
for
a
moment
about
an
hour
ago
and
too
late
i
fancied
you
saw
me
so
i
resolved
to
seek
an
opportunity
of
talking
a
little
to
you
had
i
found
that
you
had
seen
me
i
would
have
thrown
myself
on
your
high
sense
of
honor
to
keep
my
secret
some
weeks
as
it
is
i
am
satisfied
that
you
did
not
see
me
but
if
you
now
suspect
or
on
reflection
should
suspect
who
i
am
i
commit
myself
in
like
manner
entirely
to
your
honor
my
daughter
will
observe
the
same
secrecy
and
i
well
know
that
you
will
from
time
to
time
remind
her
lest
she
should
thoughtlessly
disclose
it'
she
whispered
a
few
words
to
her
daughter
kissed
her
hurriedly
twice
and
went
away
accompanied
by
the
pale
gentleman
in
black
and
disappeared
in
the
crowd
'in
the
next
room'
said
millarca
'there
is
a
window
that
looks
upon
the
hall
door
i
should
like
to
see
the
last
of
mamma
and
to
kiss
my
hand
to
her'
we
assented
of
course
and
accompanied
her
to
the
window
we
looked
out
and
saw
a
handsome
old-fashioned
carriage
with
a
troop
of
couriers
and
footmen
we
saw
the
slim
figure
of
the
pale
gentleman
in
black
as
he
held
a
thick
velvet
cloak
and
placed
it
about
her
shoulders
and
threw
the
hood
over
her
head
she
nodded
to
him
and
just
touched
his
hand
with
hers
he
bowed
low
repeatedly
as
the
door
closed
and
the
carriage
began
to
move
'she
is
gone'
said
millarca
with
a
sigh
'she
is
gone'
i
repeated
to
myself
for
the
first
time--in
the
hurried
moments
that
had
elapsed
since
my
consent--reflecting
upon
the
folly
of
my
act
'she
did
not
look
up'
said
the
young
lady
plaintively
'the
countess
had
taken
off
her
mask
perhaps
and
did
not
care
to
show
her
face'
i
said
'and
she
could
not
know
that
you
were
in
the
window'
she
sighed
and
looked
in
my
face
she
was
so
beautiful
that
i
relented
i
was
sorry
i
had
for
a
moment
repented
of
my
hospitality
and
i
determined
to
make
her
amends
for
the
unavowed
churlishness
of
my
reception
the
young
lady
replacing
her
mask
joined
my
ward
in
persuading
me
to
return
to
the
grounds
where
the
concert
was
soon
to
be
renewed
we
did
so
and
walked
up
and
down
the
terrace
that
lies
under
the
castle
windows
millarca
became
very
intimate
with
us
and
amused
us
with
lively
descriptions
and
stories
of
most
of
the
great
people
whom
we
saw
upon
the
terrace
i
liked
her
more
and
more
every
minute
her
gossip
without
being
ill-natured
was
extremely
diverting
to
me
who
had
been
so
long
out
of
the
great
world
i
thought
what
life
she
would
give
to
our
sometimes
lonely
evenings
at
home
this
ball
was
not
over
until
the
morning
sun
had
almost
reached
the
horizon
it
pleased
the
grand
duke
to
dance
till
then
so
loyal
people
could
not
go
away
or
think
of
bed
we
had
just
got
through
a
crowded
saloon
when
my
ward
asked
me
what
had
become
of
millarca
i
thought
she
had
been
by
her
side
and
she
fancied
she
was
by
mine
the
fact
was
we
had
lost
her
all
my
efforts
to
find
her
were
vain
i
feared
that
she
had
mistaken
in
the
confusion
of
a
momentary
separation
from
us
other
people
for
her
new
friends
and
had
possibly
pursued
and
lost
them
in
the
extensive
grounds
which
were
thrown
open
to
us
now
in
its
full
force
i
recognized
a
new
folly
in
my
having
undertaken
the
charge
of
a
young
lady
without
so
much
as
knowing
her
name
and
fettered
as
i
was
by
promises
of
the
reasons
for
imposing
which
i
knew
nothing
i
could
not
even
point
my
inquiries
by
saying
that
the
missing
young
lady
was
the
daughter
of
the
countess
who
had
taken
her
departure
a
few
hours
before
morning
broke
it
was
clear
daylight
before
i
gave
up
my
search
it
was
not
till
near
two
o'clock
next
day
that
we
heard
anything
of
my
missing
charge
at
about
that
time
a
servant
knocked
at
my
niece's
door
to
say
that
he
had
been
earnestly
requested
by
a
young
lady
who
appeared
to
be
in
great
distress
to
make
out
where
she
could
find
the
general
baron
spielsdorf
and
the
young
lady
his
daughter
in
whose
charge
she
had
been
left
by
her
mother
there
could
be
no
doubt
notwithstanding
the
slight
inaccuracy
that
our
young
friend
had
turned
up
and
so
she
had
would
to
heaven
we
had
lost
her
she
told
my
poor
child
a
story
to
account
for
her
having
failed
to
recover
us
for
so
long
very
late
she
said
she
had
got
to
the
housekeeper's
bedroom
in
despair
of
finding
us
and
had
then
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep
which
long
as
it
was
had
hardly
sufficed
to
recruit
her
strength
after
the
fatigues
of
the
ball
that
day
millarca
came
home
with
us
i
was
only
too
happy
after
all
to
have
secured
so
charming
a
companion
for
my
dear
girl
xiii
the
woodman
there
soon
however
appeared
some
drawbacks
in
the
first
place
millarca
complained
of
extreme
languor--the
weakness
that
remained
after
her
late
illness--and
she
never
emerged
from
her
room
till
the
afternoon
was
pretty
far
advanced
in
the
next
place
it
was
accidentally
discovered
although
she
always
locked
her
door
on
the
inside
and
never
disturbed
the
key
from
its
place
till
she
admitted
the
maid
to
assist
at
her
toilet
that
she
was
undoubtedly
sometimes
absent
from
her
room
in
the
very
early
morning
and
at
various
times
later
in
the
day
before
she
wished
it
to
be
understood
that
she
was
stirring
she
was
repeatedly
seen
from
the
windows
of
the
schloss
in
the
first
faint
grey
of
the
morning
walking
through
the
trees
in
an
easterly
direction
and
looking
like
a
person
in
a
trance
this
convinced
me
that
she
walked
in
her
sleep
but
this
hypothesis
did
not
solve
the
puzzle
how
did
she
pass
out
from
her
room
leaving
the
door
locked
on
the
inside
how
did
she
escape
from
the
house
without
unbarring
door
or
window
in
the
midst
of
my
perplexities
an
anxiety
of
a
far
more
urgent
kind
presented
itself
my
dear
child
began
to
lose
her
looks
and
health
and
that
in
a
manner
so
mysterious
and
even
horrible
that
i
became
thoroughly
frightened
she
was
at
first
visited
by
appalling
dreams
then
as
she
fancied
by
a
specter
sometimes
resembling
millarca
sometimes
in
the
shape
of
a
beast
indistinctly
seen
walking
round
the
foot
of
her
bed
from
side
to
side
lastly
came
sensations
one
not
unpleasant
but
very
peculiar
she
said
resembled
the
flow
of
an
icy
stream
against
her
breast
at
a
later
time
she
felt
something
like
a
pair
of
large
needles
pierce
her
a
little
below
the
throat
with
a
very
sharp
pain
a
few
nights
after
followed
a
gradual
and
convulsive
sense
of
strangulation
then
came
unconsciousness
i
could
hear
distinctly
every
word
the
kind
old
general
was
saying
because
by
this
time
we
were
driving
upon
the
short
grass
that
spreads
on
either
side
of
the
road
as
you
approach
the
roofless
village
which
had
not
shown
the
smoke
of
a
chimney
for
more
than
half
a
century
you
may
guess
how
strangely
i
felt
as
i
heard
my
own
symptoms
so
exactly
described
in
those
which
had
been
experienced
by
the
poor
girl
who
but
for
the
catastrophe
which
followed
would
have
been
at
that
moment
a
visitor
at
my
father's
chateau
you
may
suppose
also
how
i
felt
as
i
heard
him
detail
habits
and
mysterious
peculiarities
which
were
in
fact
those
of
our
beautiful
guest
carmilla
a
vista
opened
in
the
forest
we
were
on
a
sudden
under
the
chimneys
and
gables
of
the
ruined
village
and
the
towers
and
battlements
of
the
dismantled
castle
round
which
gigantic
trees
are
grouped
overhung
us
from
a
slight
eminence
in
a
frightened
dream
i
got
down
from
the
carriage
and
in
silence
for
we
had
each
abundant
matter
for
thinking
we
soon
mounted
the
ascent
and
were
among
the
spacious
chambers
winding
stairs
and
dark
corridors
of
the
castle
and
this
was
once
the
palatial
residence
of
the
karnsteins
said
the
old
general
at
length
as
from
a
great
window
he
looked
out
across
the
village
and
saw
the
wide
undulating
expanse
of
forest
it
was
a
bad
family
and
here
its
bloodstained
annals
were
written
he
continued
it
is
hard
that
they
should
after
death
continue
to
plague
the
human
race
with
their
atrocious
lusts
that
is
the
chapel
of
the
karnsteins
down
there
he
pointed
down
to
the
grey
walls
of
the
gothic
building
partly
visible
through
the
foliage
a
little
way
down
the
steep
and
i
hear
the
axe
of
a
woodman
he
added
busy
among
the
trees
that
surround
it
he
possibly
may
give
us
the
information
of
which
i
am
in
search
and
point
out
the
grave
of
mircalla
countess
of
karnstein
these
rustics
preserve
the
local
traditions
of
great
families
whose
stories
die
out
among
the
rich
and
titled
so
soon
as
the
families
themselves
become
extinct
we
have
a
portrait
at
home
of
mircalla
the
countess
karnstein
should
you
like
to
see
it
asked
my
father
time
enough
dear
friend
replied
the
general
i
believe
that
i
have
seen
the
original
and
one
motive
which
has
led
me
to
you
earlier
than
i
at
first
intended
was
to
explore
the
chapel
which
we
are
now
approaching
what
see
the
countess
mircalla
exclaimed
my
father
why
she
has
been
dead
more
than
a
century
not
so
dead
as
you
fancy
i
am
told
answered
the
general
i
confess
general
you
puzzle
me
utterly
replied
my
father
looking
at
him
i
fancied
for
a
moment
with
a
return
of
the
suspicion
i
detected
before
but
although
there
was
anger
and
detestation
at
times
in
the
old
general's
manner
there
was
nothing
flighty
there
remains
to
me
he
said
as
we
passed
under
the
heavy
arch
of
the
gothic
church--for
its
dimensions
would
have
justified
its
being
so
styled--but
one
object
which
can
interest
me
during
the
few
years
that
remain
to
me
on
earth
and
that
is
to
wreak
on
her
the
vengeance
which
i
thank
god
may
still
be
accomplished
by
a
mortal
arm
what
vengeance
can
you
mean
asked
my
father
in
increasing
amazement
i
mean
to
decapitate
the
monster
he
answered
with
a
fierce
flush
and
a
stamp
that
echoed
mournfully
through
the
hollow
ruin
and
his
clenched
hand
was
at
the
same
moment
raised
as
if
it
grasped
the
handle
of
an
axe
while
he
shook
it
ferociously
in
the
air
what
exclaimed
my
father
more
than
ever
bewildered
to
strike
her
head
off
cut
her
head
off
aye
with
a
hatchet
with
a
spade
or
with
anything
that
can
cleave
through
her
murderous
throat
you
shall
hear
he
answered
trembling
with
rage
and
hurrying
forward
he
said
that
beam
will
answer
for
a
seat
your
dear
child
is
fatigued
let
her
be
seated
and
i
will
in
a
few
sentences
close
my
dreadful
story
the
squared
block
of
wood
which
lay
on
the
grass-grown
pavement
of
the
chapel
formed
a
bench
on
which
i
was
very
glad
to
seat
myself
and
in
the
meantime
the
general
called
to
the
woodman
who
had
been
removing
some
boughs
which
leaned
upon
the
old
walls
and
axe
in
hand
the
hardy
old
fellow
stood
before
us
he
could
not
tell
us
anything
of
these
monuments
but
there
was
an
old
man
he
said
a
ranger
of
this
forest
at
present
sojourning
in
the
house
of
the
priest
about
two
miles
away
who
could
point
out
every
monument
of
the
old
karnstein
family
and
for
a
trifle
he
undertook
to
bring
him
back
with
him
if
we
would
lend
him
one
of
our
horses
in
little
more
than
half
an
hour
have
you
been
long
employed
about
this
forest
asked
my
father
of
the
old
man
i
have
been
a
woodman
here
he
answered
in
his
patois
under
the
forester
all
my
days
so
has
my
father
before
me
and
so
on
as
many
generations
as
i
can
count
up
i
could
show
you
the
very
house
in
the
village
here
in
which
my
ancestors
lived
how
came
the
village
to
be
deserted
asked
the
general
it
was
troubled
by
revenants
sir
several
were
tracked
to
their
graves
there
detected
by
the
usual
tests
and
extinguished
in
the
usual
way
by
decapitation
by
the
stake
and
by
burning
but
not
until
many
of
the
villagers
were
killed
but
after
all
these
proceedings
according
to
law
he
continued--so
many
graves
opened
and
so
many
vampires
deprived
of
their
horrible
animation--the
village
was
not
relieved
but
a
moravian
nobleman
who
happened
to
be
traveling
this
way
heard
how
matters
were
and
being
skilled--as
many
people
are
in
his
country--in
such
affairs
he
offered
to
deliver
the
village
from
its
tormentor
he
did
so
thus
there
being
a
bright
moon
that
night
he
ascended
shortly
after
sunset
the
towers
of
the
chapel
here
from
whence
he
could
distinctly
see
the
churchyard
beneath
him
you
can
see
it
from
that
window
from
this
point
he
watched
until
he
saw
the
vampire
come
out
of
his
grave
and
place
near
it
the
linen
clothes
in
which
he
had
been
folded
and
then
glide
away
towards
the
village
to
plague
its
inhabitants
the
stranger
having
seen
all
this
came
down
from
the
steeple
took
the
linen
wrappings
of
the
vampire
and
carried
them
up
to
the
top
of
the
tower
which
he
again
mounted
when
the
vampire
returned
from
his
prowlings
and
missed
his
clothes
he
cried
furiously
to
the
moravian
whom
he
saw
at
the
summit
of
the
tower
and
who
in
reply
beckoned
him
to
ascend
and
take
them
whereupon
the
vampire
accepting
his
invitation
began
to
climb
the
steeple
and
so
soon
as
he
had
reached
the
battlements
the
moravian
with
a
stroke
of
his
sword
clove
his
skull
in
twain
hurling
him
down
to
the
churchyard
whither
descending
by
the
winding
stairs
the
stranger
followed
and
cut
his
head
off
and
next
day
delivered
it
and
the
body
to
the
villagers
who
duly
impaled
and
burnt
them
this
moravian
nobleman
had
authority
from
the
then
head
of
the
family
to
remove
the
tomb
of
mircalla
countess
karnstein
which
he
did
effectually
so
that
in
a
little
while
its
site
was
quite
forgotten
can
you
point
out
where
it
stood
asked
the
general
eagerly
the
forester
shook
his
head
and
smiled
not
a
soul
living
could
tell
you
that
now
he
said
besides
they
say
her
body
was
removed
but
no
one
is
sure
of
that
either
having
thus
spoken
as
time
pressed
he
dropped
his
axe
and
departed
leaving
us
to
hear
the
remainder
of
the
general's
strange
story
xiv
the
meeting
my
beloved
child
he
resumed
was
now
growing
rapidly
worse
the
physician
who
attended
her
had
failed
to
produce
the
slightest
impression
on
her
disease
for
such
i
then
supposed
it
to
be
he
saw
my
alarm
and
suggested
a
consultation
i
called
in
an
abler
physician
from
gratz
several
days
elapsed
before
he
arrived
he
was
a
good
and
pious
as
well
as
a
learned
man
having
seen
my
poor
ward
together
they
withdrew
to
my
library
to
confer
and
discuss
i
from
the
adjoining
room
where
i
awaited
their
summons
heard
these
two
gentlemen's
voices
raised
in
something
sharper
than
a
strictly
philosophical
discussion
i
knocked
at
the
door
and
entered
i
found
the
old
physician
from
gratz
maintaining
his
theory
his
rival
was
combating
it
with
undisguised
ridicule
accompanied
with
bursts
of
laughter
this
unseemly
manifestation
subsided
and
the
altercation
ended
on
my
entrance
'sir'
said
my
first
physician
'my
learned
brother
seems
to
think
that
you
want
a
conjuror
and
not
a
doctor'
'pardon
me'
said
the
old
physician
from
gratz
looking
displeased
'i
shall
state
my
own
view
of
the
case
in
my
own
way
another
time
i
grieve
monsieur
le
general
that
by
my
skill
and
science
i
can
be
of
no
use
before
i
go
i
shall
do
myself
the
honor
to
suggest
something
to
you'
he
seemed
thoughtful
and
sat
down
at
a
table
and
began
to
write
profoundly
disappointed
i
made
my
bow
and
as
i
turned
to
go
the
other
doctor
pointed
over
his
shoulder
to
his
companion
who
was
writing
and
then
with
a
shrug
significantly
touched
his
forehead
this
consultation
then
left
me
precisely
where
i
was
i
walked
out
into
the
grounds
all
but
distracted
the
doctor
from
gratz
in
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
overtook
me
he
apologized
for
having
followed
me
but
said
that
he
could
not
conscientiously
take
his
leave
without
a
few
words
more
he
told
me
that
he
could
not
be
mistaken
no
natural
disease
exhibited
the
same
symptoms
and
that
death
was
already
very
near
there
remained
however
a
day
or
possibly
two
of
life
if
the
fatal
seizure
were
at
once
arrested
with
great
care
and
skill
her
strength
might
possibly
return
but
all
hung
now
upon
the
confines
of
the
irrevocable
one
more
assault
might
extinguish
the
last
spark
of
vitality
which
is
every
moment
ready
to
die
'and
what
is
the
nature
of
the
seizure
you
speak
of'
i
entreated
'i
have
stated
all
fully
in
this
note
which
i
place
in
your
hands
upon
the
distinct
condition
that
you
send
for
the
nearest
clergyman
and
open
my
letter
in
his
presence
and
on
no
account
read
it
till
he
is
with
you
you
would
despise
it
else
and
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
should
the
priest
fail
you
then
indeed
you
may
read
it'
he
asked
me
before
taking
his
leave
finally
whether
i
would
wish
to
see
a
man
curiously
learned
upon
the
very
subject
which
after
i
had
read
his
letter
would
probably
interest
me
above
all
others
and
he
urged
me
earnestly
to
invite
him
to
visit
him
there
and
so
took
his
leave
the
ecclesiastic
was
absent
and
i
read
the
letter
by
myself
at
another
time
or
in
another
case
it
might
have
excited
my
ridicule
but
into
what
quackeries
will
not
people
rush
for
a
last
chance
where
all
accustomed
means
have
failed
and
the
life
of
a
beloved
object
is
at
stake
nothing
you
will
say
could
be
more
absurd
than
the
learned
man's
letter
it
was
monstrous
enough
to
have
consigned
him
to
a
madhouse
he
said
that
the
patient
was
suffering
from
the
visits
of
a
vampire
the
punctures
which
she
described
as
having
occurred
near
the
throat
were
he
insisted
the
insertion
of
those
two
long
thin
and
sharp
teeth
which
it
is
well
known
are
peculiar
to
vampires
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
he
added
as
to
the
well-defined
presence
of
the
small
livid
mark
which
all
concurred
in
describing
as
that
induced
by
the
demon's
lips
and
every
symptom
described
by
the
sufferer
was
in
exact
conformity
with
those
recorded
in
every
case
of
a
similar
visitation
being
myself
wholly
skeptical
as
to
the
existence
of
any
such
portent
as
the
vampire
the
supernatural
theory
of
the
good
doctor
furnished
in
my
opinion
but
another
instance
of
learning
and
intelligence
oddly
associated
with
some
one
hallucination
i
was
so
miserable
however
that
rather
than
try
nothing
i
acted
upon
the
instructions
of
the
letter
i
concealed
myself
in
the
dark
dressing
room
that
opened
upon
the
poor
patient's
room
in
which
a
candle
was
burning
and
watched
there
till
she
was
fast
asleep
i
stood
at
the
door
peeping
through
the
small
crevice
my
sword
laid
on
the
table
beside
me
as
my
directions
prescribed
until
a
little
after
one
i
saw
a
large
black
object
very
ill-defined
crawl
as
it
seemed
to
me
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
swiftly
spread
itself
up
to
the
poor
girl's
throat
where
it
swelled
in
a
moment
into
a
great
palpitating
mass
for
a
few
moments
i
had
stood
petrified
i
now
sprang
forward
with
my
sword
in
my
hand
the
black
creature
suddenly
contracted
towards
the
foot
of
the
bed
glided
over
it
and
standing
on
the
floor
about
a
yard
below
the
foot
of
the
bed
with
a
glare
of
skulking
ferocity
and
horror
fixed
on
me
i
saw
millarca
speculating
i
know
not
what
i
struck
at
her
instantly
with
my
sword
but
i
saw
her
standing
near
the
door
unscathed
horrified
i
pursued
and
struck
again
she
was
gone
and
my
sword
flew
to
shivers
against
the
door
i
can't
describe
to
you
all
that
passed
on
that
horrible
night
the
whole
house
was
up
and
stirring
the
specter
millarca
was
gone
but
her
victim
was
sinking
fast
and
before
the
morning
dawned
she
died
the
old
general
was
agitated
we
did
not
speak
to
him
my
father
walked
to
some
little
distance
and
began
reading
the
inscriptions
on
the
tombstones
and
thus
occupied
he
strolled
into
the
door
of
a
side
chapel
to
prosecute
his
researches
the
general
leaned
against
the
wall
dried
his
eyes
and
sighed
heavily
i
was
relieved
on
hearing
the
voices
of
carmilla
and
madame
who
were
at
that
moment
approaching
the
voices
died
away
in
this
solitude
having
just
listened
to
so
strange
a
story
connected
as
it
was
with
the
great
and
titled
dead
whose
monuments
were
moldering
among
the
dust
and
ivy
round
us
and
every
incident
of
which
bore
so
awfully
upon
my
own
mysterious
case--in
this
haunted
spot
darkened
by
the
towering
foliage
that
rose
on
every
side
dense
and
high
above
its
noiseless
walls--a
horror
began
to
steal
over
me
and
my
heart
sank
as
i
thought
that
my
friends
were
after
all
not
about
to
enter
and
disturb
this
triste
and
ominous
scene
the
old
general's
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
as
he
leaned
with
his
hand
upon
the
basement
of
a
shattered
monument
under
a
narrow
arched
doorway
surmounted
by
one
of
those
demoniacal
grotesques
in
which
the
cynical
and
ghastly
fancy
of
old
gothic
carving
delights
i
saw
very
gladly
the
beautiful
face
and
figure
of
carmilla
enter
the
shadowy
chapel
i
was
just
about
to
rise
and
speak
and
nodded
smiling
in
answer
to
her
peculiarly
engaging
smile
when
with
a
cry
the
old
man
by
my
side
caught
up
the
woodman's
hatchet
and
started
forward
on
seeing
him
a
brutalized
change
came
over
her
features
it
was
an
instantaneous
and
horrible
transformation
as
she
made
a
crouching
step
backwards
before
i
could
utter
a
scream
he
struck
at
her
with
all
his
force
but
she
dived
under
his
blow
and
unscathed
caught
him
in
her
tiny
grasp
by
the
wrist
he
struggled
for
a
moment
to
release
his
arm
but
his
hand
opened
the
axe
fell
to
the
ground
and
the
girl
was
gone
he
staggered
against
the
wall
his
grey
hair
stood
upon
his
head
and
a
moisture
shone
over
his
face
as
if
he
were
at
the
point
of
death
the
frightful
scene
had
passed
in
a
moment
the
first
thing
i
recollect
after
is
madame
standing
before
me
and
impatiently
repeating
again
and
again
the
question
where
is
mademoiselle
carmilla
i
answered
at
length
i
don't
know--i
can't
tell--she
went
there
and
i
pointed
to
the
door
through
which
madame
had
just
entered
only
a
minute
or
two
since
but
i
have
been
standing
there
in
the
passage
ever
since
mademoiselle
carmilla
entered
and
she
did
not
return
she
then
began
to
call
carmilla
through
every
door
and
passage
and
from
the
windows
but
no
answer
came
she
called
herself
carmilla
asked
the
general
still
agitated
carmilla
yes
i
answered
aye
he
said
that
is
millarca
that
is
the
same
person
who
long
ago
was
called
mircalla
countess
karnstein
depart
from
this
accursed
ground
my
poor
child
as
quickly
as
you
can
drive
to
the
clergyman's
house
and
stay
there
till
we
come
begone
may
you
never
behold
carmilla
more
you
will
not
find
her
here
xv
ordeal
and
execution
as
he
spoke
one
of
the
strangest
looking
men
i
ever
beheld
entered
the
chapel
at
the
door
through
which
carmilla
had
made
her
entrance
and
her
exit
he
was
tall
narrow-chested
stooping
with
high
shoulders
and
dressed
in
black
his
face
was
brown
and
dried
in
with
deep
furrows
he
wore
an
oddly-shaped
hat
with
a
broad
leaf
his
hair
long
and
grizzled
hung
on
his
shoulders
he
wore
a
pair
of
gold
spectacles
and
walked
slowly
with
an
odd
shambling
gait
with
his
face
sometimes
turned
up
to
the
sky
and
sometimes
bowed
down
towards
the
ground
seemed
to
wear
a
perpetual
smile
his
long
thin
arms
were
swinging
and
his
lank
hands
in
old
black
gloves
ever
so
much
too
wide
for
them
waving
and
gesticulating
in
utter
abstraction
the
very
man
exclaimed
the
general
advancing
with
manifest
delight
my
dear
baron
how
happy
i
am
to
see
you
i
had
no
hope
of
meeting
you
so
soon
he
signed
to
my
father
who
had
by
this
time
returned
and
leading
the
fantastic
old
gentleman
whom
he
called
the
baron
to
meet
him
he
introduced
him
formally
and
they
at
once
entered
into
earnest
conversation
the
stranger
took
a
roll
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
spread
it
on
the
worn
surface
of
a
tomb
that
stood
by
he
had
a
pencil
case
in
his
fingers
with
which
he
traced
imaginary
lines
from
point
to
point
on
the
paper
which
from
their
often
glancing
from
it
together
at
certain
points
of
the
building
i
concluded
to
be
a
plan
of
the
chapel
he
accompanied
what
i
may
term
his
lecture
with
occasional
readings
from
a
dirty
little
book
whose
yellow
leaves
were
closely
written
over
they
sauntered
together
down
the
side
aisle
opposite
to
the
spot
where
i
was
standing
conversing
as
they
went
then
they
began
measuring
distances
by
paces
and
finally
they
all
stood
together
facing
a
piece
of
the
sidewall
which
they
began
to
examine
with
great
minuteness
pulling
off
the
ivy
that
clung
over
it
and
rapping
the
plaster
with
the
ends
of
their
sticks
scraping
here
and
knocking
there
at
length
they
ascertained
the
existence
of
a
broad
marble
tablet
with
letters
carved
in
relief
upon
it
with
the
assistance
of
the
woodman
who
soon
returned
a
monumental
inscription
and
carved
escutcheon
were
disclosed
they
proved
to
be
those
of
the
long
lost
monument
of
mircalla
countess
karnstein
the
old
general
though
not
i
fear
given
to
the
praying
mood
raised
his
hands
and
eyes
to
heaven
in
mute
thanksgiving
for
some
moments
tomorrow
i
heard
him
say
the
commissioner
will
be
here
and
the
inquisition
will
be
held
according
to
law
then
turning
to
the
old
man
with
the
gold
spectacles
whom
i
have
described
he
shook
him
warmly
by
both
hands
and
said
baron
how
can
i
thank
you
how
can
we
all
thank
you
you
will
have
delivered
this
region
from
a
plague
that
has
scourged
its
inhabitants
for
more
than
a
century
the
horrible
enemy
thank
god
is
at
last
tracked
my
father
led
the
stranger
aside
and
the
general
followed
i
know
that
he
had
led
them
out
of
hearing
that
he
might
relate
my
case
and
i
saw
them
glance
often
quickly
at
me
as
the
discussion
proceeded
my
father
came
to
me
kissed
me
again
and
again
and
leading
me
from
the
chapel
said
it
is
time
to
return
but
before
we
go
home
we
must
add
to
our
party
the
good
priest
who
lives
but
a
little
way
from
this
and
persuade
him
to
accompany
us
to
the
schloss
in
this
quest
we
were
successful
and
i
was
glad
being
unspeakably
fatigued
when
we
reached
home
but
my
satisfaction
was
changed
to
dismay
on
discovering
that
there
were
no
tidings
of
carmilla
of
the
scene
that
had
occurred
in
the
ruined
chapel
no
explanation
was
offered
to
me
and
it
was
clear
that
it
was
a
secret
which
my
father
for
the
present
determined
to
keep
from
me
the
sinister
absence
of
carmilla
made
the
remembrance
of
the
scene
more
horrible
to
me
the
arrangements
for
the
night
were
singular
two
servants
and
madame
were
to
sit
up
in
my
room
that
night
and
the
ecclesiastic
with
my
father
kept
watch
in
the
adjoining
dressing
room
the
priest
had
performed
certain
solemn
rites
that
night
the
purport
of
which
i
did
not
understand
any
more
than
i
comprehended
the
reason
of
this
extraordinary
precaution
taken
for
my
safety
during
sleep
i
saw
all
clearly
a
few
days
later
the
disappearance
of
carmilla
was
followed
by
the
discontinuance
of
my
nightly
sufferings
you
have
heard
no
doubt
of
the
appalling
superstition
that
prevails
in
upper
and
lower
styria
in
moravia
silesia
in
turkish
serbia
in
poland
even
in
russia
the
superstition
so
we
must
call
it
of
the
vampire
if
human
testimony
taken
with
every
care
and
solemnity
judicially
before
commissions
innumerable
each
consisting
of
many
members
all
chosen
for
integrity
and
intelligence
and
constituting
reports
more
voluminous
perhaps
than
exist
upon
any
one
other
class
of
cases
is
worth
anything
it
is
difficult
to
deny
or
even
to
doubt
the
existence
of
such
a
phenomenon
as
the
vampire
for
my
part
i
have
heard
no
theory
by
which
to
explain
what
i
myself
have
witnessed
and
experienced
other
than
that
supplied
by
the
ancient
and
well-attested
belief
of
the
country
the
next
day
the
formal
proceedings
took
place
in
the
chapel
of
karnstein
the
grave
of
the
countess
mircalla
was
opened
and
the
general
and
my
father
recognized
each
his
perfidious
and
beautiful
guest
in
the
face
now
disclosed
to
view
the
features
though
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
had
passed
since
her
funeral
were
tinted
with
the
warmth
of
life
her
eyes
were
open
no
cadaverous
smell
exhaled
from
the
coffin
the
two
medical
men
one
officially
present
the
other
on
the
part
of
the
promoter
of
the
inquiry
attested
the
marvelous
fact
that
there
was
a
faint
but
appreciable
respiration
and
a
corresponding
action
of
the
heart
the
limbs
were
perfectly
flexible
the
flesh
elastic
and
the
leaden
coffin
floated
with
blood
in
which
to
a
depth
of
seven
inches
the
body
lay
immersed
here
then
were
all
the
admitted
signs
and
proofs
of
vampirism
the
body
therefore
in
accordance
with
the
ancient
practice
was
raised
and
a
sharp
stake
driven
through
the
heart
of
the
vampire
who
uttered
a
piercing
shriek
at
the
moment
in
all
respects
such
as
might
escape
from
a
living
person
in
the
last
agony
then
the
head
was
struck
off
and
a
torrent
of
blood
flowed
from
the
severed
neck
the
body
and
head
was
next
placed
on
a
pile
of
wood
and
reduced
to
ashes
which
were
thrown
upon
the
river
and
borne
away
and
that
territory
has
never
since
been
plagued
by
the
visits
of
a
vampire
my
father
has
a
copy
of
the
report
of
the
imperial
commission
with
the
signatures
of
all
who
were
present
at
these
proceedings
attached
in
verification
of
the
statement
it
is
from
this
official
paper
that
i
have
summarized
my
account
of
this
last
shocking
scene
xvi
conclusion
i
write
all
this
you
suppose
with
composure
but
far
from
it
i
cannot
think
of
it
without
agitation
nothing
but
your
earnest
desire
so
repeatedly
expressed
could
have
induced
me
to
sit
down
to
a
task
that
has
unstrung
my
nerves
for
months
to
come
and
reinduced
a
shadow
of
the
unspeakable
horror
which
years
after
my
deliverance
continued
to
make
my
days
and
nights
dreadful
and
solitude
insupportably
terrific
let
me
add
a
word
or
two
about
that
quaint
baron
vordenburg
to
whose
curious
lore
we
were
indebted
for
the
discovery
of
the
countess
mircalla's
grave
he
had
taken
up
his
abode
in
gratz
where
living
upon
a
mere
pittance
which
was
all
that
remained
to
him
of
the
once
princely
estates
of
his
family
in
upper
styria
he
devoted
himself
to
the
minute
and
laborious
investigation
of
the
marvelously
authenticated
tradition
of
vampirism
he
had
at
his
fingers'
ends
all
the
great
and
little
works
upon
the
subject
magia
posthuma
phlegon
de
mirabilibus
augustinus
de
cura
pro
mortuis
philosophicae
et
christianae
cogitationes
de
vampiris
by
john
christofer
herenberg
and
a
thousand
others
among
which
i
remember
only
a
few
of
those
which
he
lent
to
my
father
he
had
a
voluminous
digest
of
all
the
judicial
cases
from
which
he
had
extracted
a
system
of
principles
that
appear
to
govern--some
always
and
others
occasionally
only--the
condition
of
the
vampire
i
may
mention
in
passing
that
the
deadly
pallor
attributed
to
that
sort
of
revenants
is
a
mere
melodramatic
fiction
they
present
in
the
grave
and
when
they
show
themselves
in
human
society
the
appearance
of
healthy
life
when
disclosed
to
light
in
their
coffins
they
exhibit
all
the
symptoms
that
are
enumerated
as
those
which
proved
the
vampire-life
of
the
long-dead
countess
karnstein
how
they
escape
from
their
graves
and
return
to
them
for
certain
hours
every
day
without
displacing
the
clay
or
leaving
any
trace
of
disturbance
in
the
state
of
the
coffin
or
the
cerements
has
always
been
admitted
to
be
utterly
inexplicable
the
amphibious
existence
of
the
vampire
is
sustained
by
daily
renewed
slumber
in
the
grave
its
horrible
lust
for
living
blood
supplies
the
vigor
of
its
waking
existence
the
vampire
is
prone
to
be
fascinated
with
an
engrossing
vehemence
resembling
the
passion
of
love
by
particular
persons
in
pursuit
of
these
it
will
exercise
inexhaustible
patience
and
stratagem
for
access
to
a
particular
object
may
be
obstructed
in
a
hundred
ways
it
will
never
desist
until
it
has
satiated
its
passion
and
drained
the
very
life
of
its
coveted
victim
but
it
will
in
these
cases
husband
and
protract
its
murderous
enjoyment
with
the
refinement
of
an
epicure
and
heighten
it
by
the
gradual
approaches
of
an
artful
courtship
in
these
cases
it
seems
to
yearn
for
something
like
sympathy
and
consent
in
ordinary
ones
it
goes
direct
to
its
object
overpowers
with
violence
and
strangles
and
exhausts
often
at
a
single
feast
the
vampire
is
apparently
subject
in
certain
situations
to
special
conditions
in
the
particular
instance
of
which
i
have
given
you
a
relation
mircalla
seemed
to
be
limited
to
a
name
which
if
not
her
real
one
should
at
least
reproduce
without
the
omission
or
addition
of
a
single
letter
those
as
we
say
anagrammatically
which
compose
it
carmilla
did
this
so
did
millarca
my
father
related
to
the
baron
vordenburg
who
remained
with
us
for
two
or
three
weeks
after
the
expulsion
of
carmilla
the
story
about
the
moravian
nobleman
and
the
vampire
at
karnstein
churchyard
and
then
he
asked
the
baron
how
he
had
discovered
the
exact
position
of
the
long-concealed
tomb
of
the
countess
mircalla
the
baron's
grotesque
features
puckered
up
into
a
mysterious
smile
he
looked
down
still
smiling
on
his
worn
spectacle
case
and
fumbled
with
it
then
looking
up
he
said
i
have
many
journals
and
other
papers
written
by
that
remarkable
man
the
most
curious
among
them
is
one
treating
of
the
visit
of
which
you
speak
to
karnstein
the
tradition
of
course
discolors
and
distorts
a
little
he
might
have
been
termed
a
moravian
nobleman
for
he
had
changed
his
abode
to
that
territory
and
was
beside
a
noble
but
he
was
in
truth
a
native
of
upper
styria
it
is
enough
to
say
that
in
very
early
youth
he
had
been
a
passionate
and
favored
lover
of
the
beautiful
mircalla
countess
karnstein
her
early
death
plunged
him
into
inconsolable
grief
it
is
the
nature
of
vampires
to
increase
and
multiply
but
according
to
an
ascertained
and
ghostly
law
assume
at
starting
a
territory
perfectly
free
from
that
pest
how
does
it
begin
and
how
does
it
multiply
itself
i
will
tell
you
a
person
more
or
less
wicked
puts
an
end
to
himself
a
suicide
under
certain
circumstances
becomes
a
vampire
that
specter
visits
living
people
in
their
slumbers
they
die
and
almost
invariably
in
the
grave
develop
into
vampires
this
happened
in
the
case
of
the
beautiful
mircalla
who
was
haunted
by
one
of
those
demons
my
ancestor
vordenburg
whose
title
i
still
bear
soon
discovered
this
and
in
the
course
of
the
studies
to
which
he
devoted
himself
learned
a
great
deal
more
among
other
things
he
concluded
that
suspicion
of
vampirism
would
probably
fall
sooner
or
later
upon
the
dead
countess
who
in
life
had
been
his
idol
he
conceived
a
horror
be
she
what
she
might
of
her
remains
being
profaned
by
the
outrage
of
a
posthumous
execution
he
has
left
a
curious
paper
to
prove
that
the
vampire
on
its
expulsion
from
its
amphibious
existence
is
projected
into
a
far
more
horrible
life
and
he
resolved
to
save
his
once
beloved
mircalla
from
this
he
adopted
the
stratagem
of
a
journey
here
a
pretended
removal
of
her
remains
and
a
real
obliteration
of
her
monument
when
age
had
stolen
upon
him
and
from
the
vale
of
years
he
looked
back
on
the
scenes
he
was
leaving
he
considered
in
a
different
spirit
what
he
had
done
and
a
horror
took
possession
of
him
he
made
the
tracings
and
notes
which
have
guided
me
to
the
very
spot
and
drew
up
a
confession
of
the
deception
that
he
had
practiced
if
he
had
intended
any
further
action
in
this
matter
death
prevented
him
and
the
hand
of
a
remote
descendant
has
too
late
for
many
directed
the
pursuit
to
the
lair
of
the
beast
we
talked
a
little
more
and
among
other
things
he
said
was
this
one
sign
of
the
vampire
is
the
power
of
the
hand
the
slender
hand
of
mircalla
closed
like
a
vice
of
steel
on
the
general's
wrist
when
he
raised
the
hatchet
to
strike
but
its
power
is
not
confined
to
its
grasp
it
leaves
a
numbness
in
the
limb
it
seizes
which
is
slowly
if
ever
recovered
from
the
following
spring
my
father
took
me
a
tour
through
italy
we
remained
away
for
more
than
a
year
it
was
long
before
the
terror
of
recent
events
subsided
and
to
this
hour
the
image
of
carmilla
returns
to
memory
with
ambiguous
alternations--sometimes
the
playful
languid
beautiful
girl
sometimes
the
writhing
fiend
i
saw
in
the
ruined
church
and
often
from
a
reverie
i
have
started
fancying
i
heard
the
light
step
of
carmilla
at
the
drawing
room
door
