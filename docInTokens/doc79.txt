for
fifty
years
they
lay
under
glass
in
the
dickerson
museum
and
they
were
labeled
the
medici
boots
they
were
fashioned
of
creamy
leather
pliable
as
a
young
girl's
hands
they
were
threaded
with
silver
appliqued
with
sapphire
silks
and
scarlet
and
set
on
the
tip
of
each
was
a
pale
and
lovely
amethyst
such
were
the
medici
boots
old
silas
dickerson
globe-trotter
and
collector
had
brought
the
boots
from
a
dusty
shop
in
florence
when
he
was
a
young
man
filled
with
the
lust
for
travel
and
adventure
the
years
passed
and
silas
dickerson
was
an
old
man
his
hair
white
his
eyes
dim
his
veined
hands
trembling
with
the
ague
that
precedes
death
when
he
was
ninety
and
the
years
of
his
wanderings
over
silas
dickerson
died
one
morning
as
he
sat
in
a
high-backed
venetian
chair
in
his
private
museum
the
fourteenth
century
gold-leaf
paintings
the
japanese
processional
banners
the
stolen
bones
of
a
normandy
saint--all
the
beloved
trophies
of
his
travels
must
have
watched
the
dead
man
impassively
for
hours
before
his
housekeeper
found
him
the
old
man
sat
with
his
head
thrown
back
against
the
faded
tapestry
of
the
venetian
chair
his
eyes
closed
his
bony
arms
extended
along
the
beautifully
carved
arms
of
the
chair
and
on
his
lap
lay
the
medici
boots
it
was
high
noon
when
they
found
him
and
the
sun
was
streaming
through
the
stained-glass
window
above
the
chair
and
picking
at
the
amethysts
so
that
the
violet
stones
seemed
to
eye
marthe
the
old
housekeeper
with
an
impudent
glitter
marthe
muttered
a
prayer
and
crossed
herself
before
she
ran
like
a
scared
rabbit
with
the
news
of
the
master's
death
illustration
she
imparted
to
me
those
terrible
secrets
of
the
black
arts
which
were
deep
in
her
soul
silas
dickerson's
only
surviving
relatives
the
three
young
delameters
did
not
take
too
seriously
the
note
which
was
found
among
the
papers
in
the
museum's
desk
old
silas
had
written
the
note
it
was
addressed
to
john
delameter
for
john
was
his
uncle's
favorite
but
john's
pretty
wife
suzanne
and
his
twin
brother
doctor
eric
read
it
over
his
shoulder
and
they
all
smiled
tolerantly
old
dickerson
had
written
of
things
incomprehensible
to
the
young
moderns
the
contents
of
my
private
museum
are
yours
john
to
do
with
as
you
see
fit
merely
as
a
suggestion
i
would
say
that
the
antiquarian
society
would
snap
up
many
of
the
things
a
very
few
are
of
no
particular
value
except
to
me
one
thing
i
want
done
however
the
medici
boots
of
ivory
leather
must
either
be
destroyed
or
be
put
for
ever
under
glass
in
a
public
museum
i
prefer
that
they
be
destroyed
for
they
are
a
dangerous
possession
they
have
gone
to
the
adulterous
rendezvous
celebrated
in
the
scandalous
verses
of
lorenzo
the
magnificent
they
have
shod
the
feet
of
a
murderess
they
were
cursed
by
the
church
as
trappings
of
the
devil
inciting
the
wearer
to
foul
deeds
and
intrigue
i
shall
not
disturb
you
with
all
their
hideous
history
but
i
repeat
they
are
a
dangerous
possession
i
have
taken
care
to
keep
them
under
lock
and
key
behind
plate
glass
for
more
than
fifty
years
i
have
never
taken
them
out
destroy
the
medici
boots
before
they
destroy
you
but
he
did
take
them
out
cried
suzanne
uncle
was
holding
the
boots
when--when
marthe
found
him
there
in
the
museum
john
reread
the
note
and
looked
thoughtfully
at
his
young
wife
yes
perhaps
he
was
preparing
to
destroy
them
right
then
of
course
i
think
the
poor
old
fellow
took
things
a
bit
too
seriously--he
was
very
old
you
know
and
marthe
says
he
practically
lived
in
this
museum
of
his
and
why
call
a
pair
of
old
boots
dangerous
of
course
we
all
know
the
medicis
were
plenty
dangerous
but
the
medici
boots--that's
ridiculous
john
besides----
suzanne
paused
provocatively
her
red
lips
pouting
she
looked
down
at
her
trimly
shod
feet
besides
i'd
like
to
try
on
those
medici
boots--just
once
they're
lovely
i
think
john
was
frowning
thoughtfully
he
scarcely
heard
her
suggestion
he
spoke
to
eric
instead
and
his
voice
seemed
a
bit
troubled
i
believe
that
uncle
was
getting
ready
to
destroy
those
boots
that
very
morning
he
died
else
why
should
he
have
taken
them
from
their
case--after
fifty
years
yes
i
believe
you're
right
john
because
that
note
is
dated
fully
a
month
before
uncle's
death
i
think
he
brooded
over
leaving
those
boots
to
one
he
cared
for
poor
old
man
i
wouldn't
call
him
so
eric
he
had
his
dreams
of
adventure
realized
more
fully
than
most
men
i--i
think
i'll
do
as
he
says
i'll
destroy
the
medici
boots
if
you'd
feel
better
about
it
assented
his
brother
but
suzanne
did
not
speak
she
was
looking
at
her
shoe
pursing
her
lips
thoughtfully
seeing
her
feet
encased
in
the
gay
embroideries
of
the
medici
boots
john
seemed
relieved
by
his
decision
yes
i'd
better
do
it
we'll
be
getting
back
to
town
in
a
few
days
old
erskine
you
know
uncle's
lawyer
is
coming
down
this
afternoon
then
soon
we'll
be
on
the
wing
susie
and
i--vienna
paris
the
alps--thanks
to
uncle
maybe
you
think
i'm
not
thankful
for
my
chance
at
a
bit
more
work
at
johns
hopkins
said
eric
and
they
did
not
again
speak
of
the
medici
boots





the
deaf
old
lawyer
of
the
dickerson
estate
arrived
and
suzanne
with
the
easy
capability
that
was
part
of
her
charm
saw
that
he
was
made
comfortable
at
seven
there
was
a
perfect
dinner
served
on
the
awninged
terrace
outside
the
softly
lit
living-room
the
stars
aided
the
two
little
rosy
lamps
on
the
table
and
swaying
willows
beside
a
stone-encircled
pool
swung
the
incense
of
the
garden
about
them
as
dinner
ended
john
took
from
the
pocket
of
his
coat
a
small
limp-leather
book
he
pushed
back
his
dessert
plate
and
laid
the
book
on
the
table
tapping
it
with
a
finger
as
he
spoke
this
is
the
history
of
the
medici
boots
it
was
in
the
little
wall-safe
in
the
museum
after
all
uncle
said
of
the
medici
boots
shall
we
read
it
and
turning
to
the
old
lawyer
he
told
of
silas
dickerson's
letter
concerning
the
boots
erskine
shook
his
head
smiling
most
collectors
get
an
exaggerated
sense
of
the
supernatural
read
this
by
all
means--it
should
prove
interesting
yes
read
it
john
suzanne
and
eric
spoke
almost
together
so
in
the
circle
of
rosy
light
at
their
little
table
john
read
the
story
of
the
medici
boots
it
was
not
a
long
story
and
it
was
told
in
the
language
of
an
anonymous
translator
but
as
john
read
on
his
listeners
were
drawn
together
as
by
a
spell
they
scarcely
breathed
and
the
summer
night
that
was
so
mildly
beautiful
seemed
to
take
on
a
sense
of
hovering
danger
in
the
palace
of
giuliano
de'
medici
i
have
lived
long
i
am
an
old
woman
now
as
the
years
are
reckoned
in
this
infamous
place
though
i
am
but
fifty
and
three
separated
from
my
betrothed
duped
sold
into
the
marble
labyrinth
of
this
hateful
palace
it
was
long
before
my
spirit
broke
and
i
went
forth
bejeweled
and
attired
in
elegance
among
the
silk-clad
florentines
i
was
labeled
the
most
beautiful
mistress
of
any
of
the
medici
i
was
smirked
at
fawned
upon
for
my
lord's
favors
obscenely
jested
about
in
the
orgies
that
took
place
in
the
great
banquet
hall
of
the
palace
but
in
my
heart
always
lay
the
remembrance
of
my
lost
love
and
in
my
soul
grew
black
hatred
for
the
medici
and
all
their
kind
i
who
had
dreamed
only
of
a
modest
home
a
kind
husband
black-haired
trusting
little
children
was
made
a
tool
of
the
medici
infamy
in
time
i
almost
felt
myself
in
league
with
the
devil
secretly
and
with
a
growing
sense
of
elation
i
made
frequent
rendezvous
with
a
foul
hag
whose
very
name
was
anathema
to
the
churchly
folk
of
florence
in
her
hole
of
a
room
in
a
certain
noisome
street
she
imparted
to
me
those
terrible
secrets
of
the
black
arts
which
were
deep
in
her
soul
it
was
amusing
that
she
was
paid
in
medici
gold
the
corruption
of
the
medici
bred
in
them
fear
in
me
a
sort
of
reckless
bravery
it
was
i
who
poisoned
the
wine
of
many
a
foe
of
the
medici
it
was
i
who
put
the
point
of
a
dagger
in
the
heart
of
the
old
prince
de
vittorio
whose
lands
and
power
and
palaces
were
coveted
by
my
lord
giuliano
after
a
time
bloodshed
became
an
exhilaration
to
me
the
death
agonies
of
those
who
drank
the
poisoned
cup
became
more
interesting
than
the
flattery
of
the
medici
followers
even
the
ladies
of
the
house
of
the
medici
did
me
the
honor
of
their
subtly
barbed
friendliness
through
this
very
friendliness
i
conceived
my
plan
of
sweet
revenge
upon
the
monsters
who
had
ruined
my
life
with
so
great
a
hatred
boiling
in
my
soul
that
my
mind
reeled
my
senses
throbbed
my
heart
rose
in
my
throat
like
a
spurt
of
flame
i
cursed
three
things
of
exquisite
beauty
with
all
the
fervor
of
my
newly
learned
lessons
in
devilish
lore
these
three
beautiful
objects
i
presented
to
three
ladies
of
the
house
of
medici--presented
them
with
honeyed
words
of
mock
humility
a
necklace
of
jeweled
links--i
pledged
myself
to
the
devil
and
willed
that
the
golden
necklace
would
tighten
on
the
soft
throat
of
a
lady
of
the
medici
while
she
slept
and
strangle
her
into
black
death
a
bracelet
of
filigree
and
sapphires--to
pierce
by
its
hidden
silver
needle
the
blue
vein
in
a
white
medici
wrist
so
that
her
life's
blood
would
spurt
and
she
would
know
the
terror
that
the
house
of
the
medici
gave
to
others
last
and
most
ingenious
a
pair
of
creamy
boots
pliable
embroidered
in
silver
and
silks
encrusted
with
amethysts--my
betrothal
jewels
in
my
hatred
i
cursed
the
boots
willing
that
the
wearer
as
long
as
a
shred
of
the
boots
remained
should
kill
as
i
had
killed
poison
as
i
had
poisoned
leave
all
thoughts
of
home
and
husband
and
live
in
wantonness
and
evil
so
i
cursed
the
beautiful
boots
forgetting
in
my
hate
that
perhaps
another
than
a
medici
might
in
the
years
to
come
wear
them
and
become
the
devil's
pawn
even
as
i
am
now
in
my
life
the
medici
will
have
the
boots
of
that
i
feel
sure
but
after
that--i
can
only
hope
that
this
bloody
history
of
the
boots
may
be
found
when
i
am
no
more
and
may
it
be
a
warning
i
have
lived
to
see
my
gifts
received
and
worn
and
i
have
laughed
in
my
soul
to
see
my
curses
bring
death
and
terror
and
evil
to
three
medici
women
i
know
not
what
will
become
of
the
golden
necklace
the
bracelet
or
the
boots
the
boots
may
be
lost
or
stolen
or
they
may
lie
in
a
medici
palace
for
age
on
age
but
the
curse
will
cling
to
them
till
they
are
destroyed
so
i
pray
that
no
woman
save
a
medici
will
ever
wear
them
as
i
live
and
breathe
and
do
the
bidding
of
the
lords
of
florence
the
accursed
medici--i
have
told
the
truth
when
i
am
dead
perhaps
they
will
find
this
book
and
in
hell
i
shall
know
and
be
glad

whew
said
old
erskine
john
laughed
i
don't
suppose
this
charming
history
would
have
been
any
more
thrilling
if
i
had
read
it
from
the
original
book
in
italian
of
course
wonder
where
uncle
got
it
there
was
no
mention
of
it
being
in
the
library--but
there
it
was
now
will
you
destroy
those
boots
asked
eric
and
he
was
not
entirely
in
jest
but
suzanne
said
laughingly
not
before
i
find
out
if
the
medici
lady
had
a
smaller
foot
than
i
are
they
still
in
the
museum
john
never
you
mind
my
dear
they're
not
for
the
likes
of
you
oh
don't
be
silly
john
this
is
1935
not
the
fifteenth
century
and
they
laughed
at
suzanne's
earnestness
the
book
that
held
the
story
of
the
medici
boots
lay
on
the
white
cloth
looking
like
a
book
of
lovely
verse
suzanne
a
small
white
blur
against
the
summer
dark
sat
quietly
while
the
men
talked
of
silas
dickerson
his
life
his
mania
for
collecting
his
death
that
had
so
fittingly
come
to
him
in
his
museum
it
was
nearly
twelve
when
suzanne
left
the
men
on
the
terrace
and
with
a
quiet
good-night
entered
the
living-room
and
crossed
to
the
long
shining
stairs
the
men
went
on
with
their
talk
once
john
looking
toward
the
jutting
wing
that
was
the
museum
exclaimed
look
at
that
will
you
why--i'd
swear
i
saw
a
light
in
the
museum
you
locked
it
didn't
you
asked
eric
of
course
the
key's
in
my
desk
upstairs
h-m
i'm
probably
mistaken
but
it
did
seem
as
though
a
light
shone
there
just
a
moment
ago
reflection
from
the
living-room
window
i
think
country
life
is
making
you
jittery
john
and
eric
laughed
at
his
brother
the
men
sat
on
reluctant
to
leave
the
beauty
of
the
night
and
it
was
almost
two
o'clock
when
they
finally
went
inside
john
said
i
think
i'll
not
disturb
suzanne
and
he
went
to
sleep
in
a
wide
four-postered
bed
in
a
room
next
to
his
wife
eric
and
the
old
lawyer
were
in
rooms
across
the
hall





the
still
summer
night
closed
about
the
house
of
silas
dickerson
and
when
the
moon
lay
dying
against
the
bank
of
cloud
puffed
across
a
sky
by
the
little
wind
that
came
before
dawn
young
doctor
eric
delameter
awoke
suddenly
and
completely
to
a
feeling
of
clammy
apprehension
he
had
not
locked
his
door
and
now
across
the
grayness
of
the
room
he
saw
it
slowly
opening
a
hand
was
closed
around
the
edge
of
the
door--a
woman's
hand
small
and
white
and
jeweled
eric
sat
straight
and
tense
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
peering
across
the
room
a
woman
young
and
slender
in
a
long
trailing
gown
came
toward
him
smiling
it
was
suzanne
with
a
gasp
eric
watched
her
approach
till
she
stood
directly
before
him
suzanne
you
are
asleep
suzanne
shall
i
call
john
he
thought
that
perhaps
he
should
not
waken
her
there
were
things
one
must
remember
about
sleep-walkers
but
physicians
scarcely
believed
them
eric
was
puzzled
too
by
her
costume
it
was
not
a
night-robe
she
wore
but
an
elaborate
trailing
dress
upon
which
embroideries
in
silver
shone
faintly
her
short
black
curls
were
bound
about
three
times
with
strands
of
pearly
beads
her
slim
white
arms
were
loaded
with
bracelets
the
pointed
toes
of
little
shoes
peeped
beneath
her
gown
little
shoes
of
creamy
leather
an
amethyst
gleamed
on
each
shoe
the
sight
of
these
amethystine
tips
affected
eric
strangely
much
as
though
he
had
looked
at
something
hideously
repulsive
he
stood
up
and
put
out
a
hand
to
touch
suzanne's
arm
suzanne
he
said
gently
let
me
take
you
to
john
shall
i
suzanne
looked
up
at
him
and
her
brown
eyes
usually
so
merry
were
deeply
slumberous
not
with
sleep
but
with
a
look
of
utter
abandon
she
shook
her
pearl-bound
head
slowly
smilingly
no
not
john
i
want
you
eric
mad
suzanne
must
be
mad
was
eric's
quick
thought
but
her
caress
was
swifter
than
his
thought
both
jewel-laden
arms
about
his
neck
suzanne
kissed
him
her
red
lips
pouting
warmly
upon
his
suzanne
you
don't
know
what
you're
doing
he
grasped
both
her
hands
in
his
and
with
a
haste
that
would
have
seemed
ludicrous
to
him
had
he
viewed
the
scene
in
a
picture-play
he
hurried
her
out
of
his
room
and
across
the
hall
eric
opened
her
door
softly
and
with
no
gentle
hand
shoved
suzanne
inside
her
room
she
seemed
like
a
little
animal
in
his
grasp
she
hissed
at
him
clawed
and
scratched
at
his
hand
but
when
he
had
shut
the
door
she
did
not
open
it
again
and
after
a
moment
he
went
back
to
his
own
room





his
mouth
set
in
a
firm
line
his
heart
beating
fast
eric
locked
his
door
with
a
noiseless
turn
of
the
key
it
was
almost
dawn
and
the
garden
lay
like
a
rare
pastel
outside
his
window
but
eric
saw
none
of
it
he
scarcely
thought
though
his
lips
moved
as
if
chaotic
words
were
struggling
for
utterance
he
looked
down
at
his
hand
where
two
long
red
scratches
oozed
a
trickle
of
blood
after
he
had
washed
his
hand
he
lay
down
on
his
bed
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
arm
against
the
picture
of
suzanne
above
all
else
there
stood
out
the
gleaming
tips
of
her
little
shoes
as
he
had
glimpsed
them
through
the
dim
light
of
his
room
when
she
came
toward
him
she
wore
the
medici
boots
the
medici
boots
suzanne
must
have
taken
them
from
the
museum
over
and
over
he
said
it--the
medici
boots
the
medici
boots
eric
rather
dreaded
breakfast
but
when
he
came
down
at
eight
to
the
terrace
where
a
rustic
table
was
set
invitingly
he
found
john
and
the
lawyer
awaiting
him
john
greeted
his
brother
affectionately
morning
old
boy
hope
you
slept
well
why
so
solemn
feeling
seedy
no
no
i
am
perfectly
all
right
eric
replied
hastily
relieved
that
suzanne
was
not
present
he
added
with
a
scarcely
noticeable
hesitation
suzanne
not
coming
down
no
replied
john
easily
she
seemed
to
want
to
sleep
awhile
sent
her
regrets
she'll
see
us
at
lunch
john
went
on
i
certainly
had
a
nightmare
last
night
thought
a
woman
in
a
long
shining
dress
came
into
my
room
and
tried
to
stab
me
this
morning
i
found
that
a
glass
on
my
bed-table
was
overturned
and
broken
and
by
george
i'd
cut
my
wrist
on
it
he
showed
a
jagged
cut
on
his
wrist
take
a
look
doctor
eric
eric
looked
at
the
cut
carefully
not
bad
but
you
might
have
bled
to
death
had
it
been
a
quarter
of
an
inch
to
the
left
if
you
like
i'll
fix
it
up
a
bit
for
you
after
breakfast
eric's
voice
was
calm
enough
but
his
pulse
was
pounding
his
heart
sick
all
morning
he
rode
through
the
countryside
adjoining
the
dickerson
estate
but
he
let
the
mare
go
as
she
liked
and
where
she
liked
for
his
mind
was
busy
with
the
events
of
the
hour
before
dawn
he
knew
that
the
slash
on
his
brother's
wrist
was
made
by
steel
not
glass
yet
when
the
ride
was
over
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
tell
john
of
suzanne's
visit
she
must
have
been
sleep-walking
though
i
can't
account
for
the
way
she
was
decked
out
i've
always
thought
suzanne
extremely
modest
in
her
dress
certainly
not
inclined
to
load
herself
with
jewelry
and
those
boots
john
must
get
them
today
and
destroy
them
as
he
said
silly
perhaps
but----
his
thoughts
went
on
and
on
always
returning
to
the
medici
boots
in
spite
of
himself





eric
came
back
from
his
ride
at
eleven
o'clock
with
as
troubled
a
mind
as
when
he
began
it
he
almost
feared
to
see
suzanne
at
lunch
when
he
did
meet
her
with
john
and
mr
erskine
on
the
cool
shaded
porch
where
they
lunched
he
saw
there
was
nothing
to
fear
the
amorous
clinging
woman
of
the
hour
before
dawn
was
not
there
at
all
there
was
only
the
suzanne
whom
eric
knew
and
loved
as
a
sister
here
again
was
their
merry
little
suzanne
somewhat
spoiled
by
her
husband
it
is
true
but
a
suzanne
sweetly
feminine
almost
childish
in
a
crisp
white
frock
and
little
low-heeled
sandals
their
talk
was
lazily
pleasant--of
tennis
honors
and
horses
of
the
prize
delphiniums
in
the
garden
of
the
tiny
maltese
kitten
which
suzanne
had
brought
up
from
the
stables
late
that
morning
and
installed
in
a
pink-bowed
basket
on
the
porch
she
showed
the
kitten
to
eric
handling
its
tiny
paws
gently
hushing
its
plaintive
mews
with
ridiculous
pet
names
perhaps
i'm
a
bigger
fool
than
i
know
perhaps
it
never
happened
except
in
a
dream
eric
told
himself
unhappily
and
yet----
he
looked
at
the
red
marks
on
his
hand
marks
made
by
a
furious
suzanne
in
that
hour
before
the
dawn
too
he
remembered
the
cut
on
john's
wrist
the
cut
so
near
the
vein
eric
declined
john's
invitation
to
go
through
the
museum
with
him
that
afternoon
but
he
said
with
a
queer
sense
of
diffidence
while
you're
there
john
you'd
better
get
rid
of
the
medici
boots
creepy
things
to
have
around
i
think
they'll
be
destroyed
all
right
but
suzanne
is
just
bound
to
try
them
on
i'll
get
them
though
and
do
as
uncle
said
eric
remained
on
the
terrace
speculating
somewhat
on
just
what
john
and
suzanne
would
do
now
that
the
huge
fortune
of
silas
dickerson
was
theirs
eric
was
not
envious
of
his
brother's
good
luck
and
he
was
thankful
for
his
share
in
old
silas'
generosity
at
five
o'clock
he
entered
the
hall
just
as
suzanne
hurried
in
from
the
kitchen
she
spread
our
her
hands
laughingly
with
my
own
fair
hands
i've
made
individual
almond
tortonis
for
dessert
cook
thinks
i'm
a
wonder
each
masterpiece
in
a
fluted
silver
dish
silver
candies
sprinkled
on
the
pink
whipped
cream
o-oh
she
made
big
eyes
in
mock
gluttony
eric
forgot
for
a
moment
that
there
ever
had
been
another
suzanne
you're
nothing
but
a
little
girl
suzie
you
with
your
rhapsodies
over
pink
whipped
cream
but
it's
sweet
of
you
to
go
to
such
trouble
on
a
warm
afternoon
see
you
and
the
whatever-you-call-'ems
at
dinner
they're
tortonis
eric
tortonis
suzanne
ran
lightly
up
the
stairs
eric
followed
more
slowly
he
entered
his
room
thinking
that
there
were
some
things
which
must
be
explained
in
this
house
with
the
old
museum





twenty
minutes
before
dinner
eric
and
john
were
on
the
terrace
waiting
for
suzanne
john
was
talkative
which
was
just
as
well
as
he
might
have
wondered
at
his
brother's
silence
eric
was
torn
between
a
desire
to
tell
his
brother
his
reluctant
suspicions
concerning
the
medici
boots
and
suzanne
and
his
inclination
to
leave
things
alone
till
the
boots
could
be
destroyed
he
said
diffidently
john
has
suzanne
those--those
boots
john
chuckled
why
yes
i
saw
them
in
her
room
do
you
know
she
went
down
to
the
museum
last
night
and
took
those
boots
it
was
a
light
i
saw
in
the
museum
it
was
her
light
suzanne
has
ideas
wants
to
wear
the
boots
just
once
she
says
to
lay
the
ghost
of
this
what's-her-name--maria
modena
suzanne
says
she
couldn't
sleep
much
last
night
got
up
early
and
tried
on
those
boots
well
i
think
i'll
destroy
'em
tomorrow
uncle's
wish
so
i'll
do
it
tried
them
on
did
she
well
if
you
should
ask
me
i'd
say
that
history
of
the
boots
was
a
bit
too
exciting
for
suzanne
it
was
a
haunting
story
uncle
must
have
swallowed
it
hook
line
and
sinker
eh
of
course
his
letter
showed
that
but
suzanne
lives
in
the
present
not
the
past
as
uncle
did
i
suppose
suzanne
will
wear
those
boots
or
she
won't
feel
satisfied
i
don't
exactly
like
the
idea
i
must
confess
something
like
an
electric
shock
passed
through
eric
he
said
somewhat
breathlessly
i
don't
think
suzanne
ought
to
have
the
medici
boots
john
looked
at
him
curiously
and
laughed
i
never
knew
you
were
superstitious
eric
but
do
you
really
think----
i
don't
know
what
i
think
john
but
if
she
were
my
wife
i'd
take
those
boots
away
from
her
uncle
may
have
known
what
he
was
talking
about
well
i
think
she's
intending
to
wear
them
at
dinner
so
prepare
to
be
dazzled
here
she
is
now
greetings
sweet-heart
suzanne
swept
across
the
terrace
her
gown
goldly
shimmering
pearls
bound
about
her
head
as
eric
had
seen
her
in
the
dim
hour
before
dawn
again
the
rows
of
bracelets
were
weighting
her
slim
arms
and
she
wore
the
medici
boots
the
amethyst
tips
peeping
beneath
her
shining
dress
john
ever
ready
for
gay
clowning
arose
and
bowed
low
hail
empress
a-ah
the
dress
you
got
in
florence
on
our
honeymoon
isn't
it
and
those
darned
medici
boots
suzanne
unsmilingly
extended
her
hand
for
him
to
kiss
john
arched
an
eyebrow
comically
what's
the
matter
honey
going
regal
on
me
and
retaining
her
hand
he
kissed
each
of
her
fingers
suzanne
snatched
away
her
hand
and
the
glance
she
gave
her
husband
was
one
of
venomous
hauteur
to
eric
she
turned
a
look
that
was
an
open
caress
leaning
toward
him
putting
a
hand
on
his
arm
as
he
stood
beside
his
chair
stern-lipped
with
eyes
that
would
not
look
at
john's
hurt
bewilderment
the
three
sat
down
then
in
the
low
wicker
chairs
and
waited
for
dinner--three
people
with
oddly
different
emotions
john
was
hurt
slightly
impatient
with
his
bride
eric
was
furious
with
suzanne
though
there
was
in
his
heart
the
almost
certain
knowledge
that
the
suzanne
beside
them
on
the
terrace
was
not
the
suzanne
they
knew
but
a
cruelly
strange
woman
the
product
of
a
sinister
force
unknown
and
compelling
no
one
looking
on
suzanne's
red-lipped
and
heavy-lidded
beauty
could
miss
the
knowledge
that
here
was
a
woman
dangerously
subtle
carrying
a
power
more
devastating
than
the
darting
lightning
that
now
and
then
showed
itself
over
the
tree-tops
of
the
garden
eric
began
to
feel
something
of
this
and
there
shaped
in
his
mind
a
wariness
a
defense
against
this
woman
who
was
not
suzanne
no
al
fresco
dining
tonight
said
john
as
the
darkening
sky
was
veined
by
a
sudden
spray
of
blue-green
light
rain
on
the
way
pretty
good
storm
i'd
say
i
like
it
replied
suzanne
drawing
in
a
deep
breath
of
the
sultry
air
john
laughed
since
when
sweet-heart
you
usually
shake
and
shiver
through
a
thunderstorm
suzanne
ignored
him
she
smiled
at
eric
and
said
in
a
low
tone
and
if
i
should
lose
my
bravery
you
would
take
care
of
me
wouldn't
you
eric
before
eric
could
reply
dinner
was
announced
and
he
felt
a
relief
and
also
a
dread
this
dinner
was
going
to
be
difficult
john
offered
his
arm
to
his
wife
smiling
at
her
hoping
for
a
smile
in
return
but
suzanne
shrugged
and
said
in
a
caressing
voice
eric





eric
could
only
bow
stiffly
and
offer
his
arm
while
john
walked
slowly
beside
them
his
face
thoughtful
his
gay
spirits
gone
during
dinner
however
he
tried
to
revive
the
lagging
conversation
suzanne
spoke
in
a
staccato
voice
and
her
choice
of
words
seemed
strange
to
eric
almost
as
though
she
were
translating
her
own
thoughts
from
a
foreign
tongue
and
finally
suzanne's
promised
dessert
came
cool
and
tempting
in
its
silver
dishes
eric
saw
a
chance
to
make
the
talk
more
natural
he
said
gayly
johnny
your
wife's
a
chef
a
famous
pastry
chef
behold
the
work
of
her
hands
what
did
you
say
it
was
suzanne
this
oh--i
do
not
know
what
it
is
called
but
this
afternoon
as
you
were
leaving
the
kitchen--didn't
you
say
it
was
almond
something
or
other
she
shook
her
head
smiling
perhaps
it
is
i
wouldn't
know
the
maid
had
placed
the
tray
with
the
three
silver
dishes
of
dessert
before
suzanne
that
she
might
put
on
them
the
final
sprinkling
of
delicate
silver
candies
daintily
suzanne
sifted
the
shining
bubbles
over
the
fluff
of
cream
eric
watching
her
felt
very
little
surprize
when
he
saw
suzanne
with
almost
legerdemain
deftness
sift
upon
one
dish
a
film
of
pinkish
powder
which
could
not
be
detected
after
it
lay
on
the
pink
cream
waiting
he
knew
not
for
what
moment
he
watched
suzanne
pass
the
silver
dishes
herself
saw
her
offer
the
one
with
the
powdered
top
to
john
and
it
was
then
that
their
attention
was
attracted
by
the
entrance
of
the
maltese
kitten
so
tiny
it
was
so
brave
in
its
careening
totter
across
the
shiny
floor
small
tail
hoisted
like
a
sail
that
john
and
eric
laughed
aloud
suzanne
merely
glanced
down
at
the
little
creature
and
turned
away
the
kitten
however
came
to
her
chair
put
up
a
tiny
paw
and
caught
its
curved
claws
in
the
fragile
stuff
of
suzanne's
gown
instantly
her
face
became
distorted
with
rage
and
she
kicked
out
at
the
kitten
savagely
and
with
set
lips
it
seemed
to
eric
that
the
amethysts
on
the
medici
boots
winked
wickedly
in
the
light
of
the
big
chandelier
the
kitten
was
flung
some
ten
feet
away
and
lay
in
a
small
panting
heap
john
sprang
up
suzanne
how
could
you
he
took
the
kitten
in
his
arms
and
soothed
it
why
its
heart's
beating
like
a
trip-hammer
he
said
i
don't
understand
suzanne----
as
the
kitten
grew
quiet
he
took
a
large
rose-leaf
from
the
table-flowers
and
spread
it
with
a
heaping
spoonful
of
the
pink
cream
from
his
dessert
then
he
put
the
kitten
on
the
floor
beside
it
here
little
one
lick
this
up
it's
fancy
eating
suzanne's
sorry
i
know
she
is
the
kitten
with
the
greed
of
its
kind
devoured
the
cream
covering
its
small
nose
and
whiskers
with
a
pinkish
film
suzanne
sat
back
in
her
chair
fingering
her
bracelets
her
eyes
on
eric's
face
john
watched
the
kitten
and
eric
watched
too--watched
tensely
for
he
sensed
what
would
happen
to
it
the
kitten
finished
the
cream
licked
its
paws
and
whiskers
and
turned
to
walk
away
then
it
spun
around
in
a
frantic
convulsion
and
in
a
moment
lay
dead
on
its
back
its
tiny
fed
tongue
protruding
its
paws
rigid
outside
the
storm
glowered
and
in
the
chartreuse
light
of
the
forked
lightning
the
great
chandelier
was
turned
to
a
sickly
radiance
thunder
rolled
like
muffled
drums
suddenly
suzanne
began
to
laugh
peal
after
peal
of
terrible
laughter
and
then
after
a
glare
of
lightning
the
big
chandelier
winked
out
the
room
was
plunged
into
stormy
darkness
and
they
could
hear
the
rain
lashing
through
the
garden
to
hurl
itself
against
the
windows
don't
be
frightened
suzanne
it
was
john's
solicitous
voice
and
it
was
followed
by
a
quick
movement
from
suzanne's
side
of
the
table
a
sheet
of
blue-green
light
illumined
the
room
for
an
instant
and
eric
saw
suzanne
struggling
in
her
husband's
arms
one
jeweled
arm
uplifted
and
in
her
hand
a
shining
dagger





with
a
bound
that
was
almost
involuntary
eric
reached
them
and
struck
at
the
knife
in
suzanne's
hand
it
clattered
to
the
floor
and
as
though
the
fury
of
the
storm
and
suzanne's
madness
both
were
spent
the
slashing
rain
and
the
lightning
stopped
abruptly
and
suzanne
ceased
to
struggle
light
the
candles
eric--quickly--on
the
mantel
to
your
right
suzanne
is
hurt
in
the
candle-light
palely
golden
and
swaying
eric
saw
suzanne
slumped
limply
in
john's
arms
the
hem
of
her
golden
dress
was
redly
wet
and
one
cream-colored
little
shoe
was
fast
becoming
soaked
with
blood
from
a
slash
across
the
instep
let's
get
her
over
to
the
window-seat
eric
do
something
for
her--oh
sweet-heart
don't
moan
like
that
there
was
no
question
or
reproach
in
john's
voice
only
compassion
eric
took
off
his
coat
rolled
up
his
sleeves
his
mouth
was
grimly
set
his
hands
steady
his
voice
crisply
professional
take
off
those
shoes
john
she'll--be
herself
then
i
mean
that
she'll
be
suzanne--not
a
murderess
of
the
medicis
take
them
off
john
they're
at
the
bottom
of
this
you
mean----
john's
voice
was
breathless
his
lips
trembling
i
mean
those
hellish
boots
have
changed
suzanne
from
a
sweet
and
lovely
girl
to--well
do
as
i
tell
you
i'll
be
back
with
gauze
and
some
things
i
need
when
eric
hurried
back
there
were
three
servants
grouped
at
the
dining-room
door
he
spoke
to
them
bruskly
and
they
left
wide-eyed
and
whispering
eric
closed
the
door
while
the
wet
leaves
tapped
against
the
windows
and
stars
struggled
through
the
clouds
eric
worked
silently
expertly
grimly
by
the
light
of
a
flashlight
held
in
john's
unsteady
hands
and
the
light
of
the
flickering
candles
the
house
lights
were
all
snuffed
out
by
the
storm
there
eric
gave
a
satisfied
grunt
the
brothers
stood
looking
at
suzanne
who
seemed
asleep
her
golden
dress
glimmered
in
the
candle-light
and
the
pearls
were
slipping
from
her
dark
hair
the
medici
boots
lay
in
a
limp
and
bloody
heap
in
a
corner
where
eric
had
flung
them
when
she
awakes
i
shouldn't
tell
her
about
any
of
this
if
i
were
you
john
there
are
things
you
haven't
told
me
eric
aren't
there
things
about--the
medici
boots
eric
looked
steadily
at
his
brother
yes
old
fellow
and
after
i've
told
you
those
boots
must
be
destroyed
we'll
burn
them
before
this
night
is
over
we
mustn't
move
her
now
we'll
go
out
on
the
terrace--it's
wet
there
but
the
air
is
fresh
did
you
smell--something
peculiar
for
as
they
passed
the
corner
where
the
medici
boots
lay
slashed
and
bloody
eric
could
have
sworn
that
there
came
to
him
a
horrid
odor
fetid
hotly
offensive--the
odor
of
iniquity
and
ancient
bloody
death
