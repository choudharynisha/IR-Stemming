horace
walpole
was
the
youngest
son
of
sir
robert
walpole
the
great
statesman
who
died
earl
of
orford
he
was
born
in
1717
the
year
in
which
his
father
resigned
office
remaining
in
opposition
for
almost
three
years
before
his
return
to
a
long
tenure
of
power
horace
walpole
was
educated
at
eton
where
he
formed
a
school
friendship
with
thomas
gray
who
was
but
a
few
months
older
in
1739
gray
was
travelling-companion
with
walpole
in
france
and
italy
until
they
differed
and
parted
but
the
friendship
was
afterwards
renewed
and
remained
firm
to
the
end
horace
walpole
went
from
eton
to
kingâ€™s
college
cambridge
and
entered
parliament
in
1741
the
year
before
his
fatherâ€™s
final
resignation
and
acceptance
of
an
earldom
his
way
of
life
was
made
easy
to
him
as
usher
of
the
exchequer
comptroller
of
the
pipe
and
clerk
of
the
estreats
in
the
exchequer
he
received
nearly
two
thousand
a
year
for
doing
nothing
lived
with
his
father
and
amused
himself
horace
walpole
idled
and
amused
himself
with
the
small
life
of
the
fashionable
world
to
which
he
was
proud
of
belonging
though
he
had
a
quick
eye
for
its
vanities
he
had
social
wit
and
liked
to
put
it
to
small
uses
but
he
was
not
an
empty
idler
and
there
were
seasons
when
he
could
become
a
sharp
judge
of
himself
â€œi
am
sensibleâ€
he
wrote
to
his
most
intimate
friend
â€œi
am
sensible
of
having
more
follies
and
weaknesses
and
fewer
real
good
qualities
than
most
men
i
sometimes
reflect
on
this
though
i
own
too
seldom
i
always
want
to
begin
acting
like
a
man
and
a
sensible
one
which
i
think
i
might
be
if
i
wouldâ€
he
had
deep
home
affections
and
under
many
polite
affectations
plenty
of
good
sense
horace
walpoleâ€™s
father
died
in
1745
the
eldest
son
who
succeeded
to
the
earldom
died
in
1751
and
left
a
son
george
who
was
for
a
time
insane
and
lived
until
1791
as
george
left
no
child
the
title
and
estates
passed
to
horace
walpole
then
seventy-four
years
old
and
the
only
uncle
who
survived
horace
walpole
thus
became
earl
of
orford
during
the
last
six
years
of
his
life
as
to
the
title
he
said
that
he
felt
himself
being
called
names
in
his
old
age
he
died
unmarried
in
the
year
1797
at
the
age
of
eighty
he
had
turned
his
house
at
strawberry
hill
by
the
thames
near
twickenham
into
a
gothic
villaâ€”eighteenth-century
gothicâ€”and
amused
himself
by
spending
freely
upon
its
adornment
with
such
things
as
were
then
fashionable
as
objects
of
taste
but
he
delighted
also
in
his
flowers
and
his
trellises
of
roses
and
the
quiet
thames
when
confined
by
gout
to
his
london
house
in
arlington
street
flowers
from
strawberry
hill
and
a
bird
were
necessary
consolations
he
set
up
also
at
strawberry
hill
a
private
printing
press
at
which
he
printed
his
friend
grayâ€™s
poems
also
in
1758
his
own
â€œcatalogue
of
the
royal
and
noble
authors
of
englandâ€
and
five
volumes
of
â€œanecdotes
of
painting
in
englandâ€
between
1762
and
1771
horace
walpole
produced
the
castle
of
otranto
in
1765
at
the
mature
age
of
forty-eight
it
was
suggested
by
a
dream
from
which
he
said
he
waked
one
morning
and
of
which
â€œall
i
could
recover
was
that
i
had
thought
myself
in
an
ancient
castle
a
very
natural
dream
for
a
head
like
mine
filled
with
gothic
story
and
that
on
the
uppermost
banister
of
a
great
staircase
i
saw
a
gigantic
hand
in
armour
in
the
evening
i
sat
down
and
began
to
write
without
knowing
in
the
least
what
i
intended
to
say
or
relateâ€
so
began
the
tale
which
professed
to
be
translated
by
â€œwilliam
marshal
gentleman
from
the
italian
of
onuphro
muralto
canon
of
the
church
of
st
nicholas
at
otrantoâ€
it
was
written
in
two
months
walpoleâ€™s
friend
gray
reported
to
him
that
at
cambridge
the
book
made
â€œsome
of
them
cry
a
little
and
all
in
general
afraid
to
go
to
bed
oâ€™
nightsâ€
the
castle
of
otranto
was
in
its
own
way
an
early
sign
of
the
reaction
towards
romance
in
the
latter
part
of
the
last
century
this
gives
it
interest
but
it
has
had
many
followers
and
the
hardy
modern
reader
when
he
readâ€™s
grayâ€™s
note
from
cambridge
needs
to
be
reminded
of
its
date
h
m
preface
to
the
first
edition
the
following
work
was
found
in
the
library
of
an
ancient
catholic
family
in
the
north
of
england
it
was
printed
at
naples
in
the
black
letter
in
the
year
1529
how
much
sooner
it
was
written
does
not
appear
the
principal
incidents
are
such
as
were
believed
in
the
darkest
ages
of
christianity
but
the
language
and
conduct
have
nothing
that
savours
of
barbarism
the
style
is
the
purest
italian
if
the
story
was
written
near
the
time
when
it
is
supposed
to
have
happened
it
must
have
been
between
1095
the
era
of
the
first
crusade
and
1243
the
date
of
the
last
or
not
long
afterwards
there
is
no
other
circumstance
in
the
work
that
can
lead
us
to
guess
at
the
period
in
which
the
scene
is
laid
the
names
of
the
actors
are
evidently
fictitious
and
probably
disguised
on
purpose
yet
the
spanish
names
of
the
domestics
seem
to
indicate
that
this
work
was
not
composed
until
the
establishment
of
the
arragonian
kings
in
naples
had
made
spanish
appellations
familiar
in
that
country
the
beauty
of
the
diction
and
the
zeal
of
the
author
moderated
however
by
singular
judgment
concur
to
make
me
think
that
the
date
of
the
composition
was
little
antecedent
to
that
of
the
impression
letters
were
then
in
their
most
flourishing
state
in
italy
and
contributed
to
dispel
the
empire
of
superstition
at
that
time
so
forcibly
attacked
by
the
reformers
it
is
not
unlikely
that
an
artful
priest
might
endeavour
to
turn
their
own
arms
on
the
innovators
and
might
avail
himself
of
his
abilities
as
an
author
to
confirm
the
populace
in
their
ancient
errors
and
superstitions
if
this
was
his
view
he
has
certainly
acted
with
signal
address
such
a
work
as
the
following
would
enslave
a
hundred
vulgar
minds
beyond
half
the
books
of
controversy
that
have
been
written
from
the
days
of
luther
to
the
present
hour
this
solution
of
the
authorâ€™s
motives
is
however
offered
as
a
mere
conjecture
whatever
his
views
were
or
whatever
effects
the
execution
of
them
might
have
his
work
can
only
be
laid
before
the
public
at
present
as
a
matter
of
entertainment
even
as
such
some
apology
for
it
is
necessary
miracles
visions
necromancy
dreams
and
other
preternatural
events
are
exploded
now
even
from
romances
that
was
not
the
case
when
our
author
wrote
much
less
when
the
story
itself
is
supposed
to
have
happened
belief
in
every
kind
of
prodigy
was
so
established
in
those
dark
ages
that
an
author
would
not
be
faithful
to
the
manners
of
the
times
who
should
omit
all
mention
of
them
he
is
not
bound
to
believe
them
himself
but
he
must
represent
his
actors
as
believing
them
if
this
air
of
the
miraculous
is
excused
the
reader
will
find
nothing
else
unworthy
of
his
perusal
allow
the
possibility
of
the
facts
and
all
the
actors
comport
themselves
as
persons
would
do
in
their
situation
there
is
no
bombast
no
similes
flowers
digressions
or
unnecessary
descriptions
everything
tends
directly
to
the
catastrophe
never
is
the
readerâ€™s
attention
relaxed
the
rules
of
the
drama
are
almost
observed
throughout
the
conduct
of
the
piece
the
characters
are
well
drawn
and
still
better
maintained
terror
the
authorâ€™s
principal
engine
prevents
the
story
from
ever
languishing
and
it
is
so
often
contrasted
by
pity
that
the
mind
is
kept
up
in
a
constant
vicissitude
of
interesting
passions
some
persons
may
perhaps
think
the
characters
of
the
domestics
too
little
serious
for
the
general
cast
of
the
story
but
besides
their
opposition
to
the
principal
personages
the
art
of
the
author
is
very
observable
in
his
conduct
of
the
subalterns
they
discover
many
passages
essential
to
the
story
which
could
not
be
well
brought
to
light
but
by
their
naã¯vetã©
and
simplicity
in
particular
the
womanish
terror
and
foibles
of
bianca
in
the
last
chapter
conduce
essentially
towards
advancing
the
catastrophe
it
is
natural
for
a
translator
to
be
prejudiced
in
favour
of
his
adopted
work
more
impartial
readers
may
not
be
so
much
struck
with
the
beauties
of
this
piece
as
i
was
yet
i
am
not
blind
to
my
authorâ€™s
defects
i
could
wish
he
had
grounded
his
plan
on
a
more
useful
moral
than
this
that
â€œthe
sins
of
fathers
are
visited
on
their
children
to
the
third
and
fourth
generationâ€
i
doubt
whether
in
his
time
any
more
than
at
present
ambition
curbed
its
appetite
of
dominion
from
the
dread
of
so
remote
a
punishment
and
yet
this
moral
is
weakened
by
that
less
direct
insinuation
that
even
such
anathema
may
be
diverted
by
devotion
to
st
nicholas
here
the
interest
of
the
monk
plainly
gets
the
better
of
the
judgment
of
the
author
however
with
all
its
faults
i
have
no
doubt
but
the
english
reader
will
be
pleased
with
a
sight
of
this
performance
the
piety
that
reigns
throughout
the
lessons
of
virtue
that
are
inculcated
and
the
rigid
purity
of
the
sentiments
exempt
this
work
from
the
censure
to
which
romances
are
but
too
liable
should
it
meet
with
the
success
i
hope
for
i
may
be
encouraged
to
reprint
the
original
italian
though
it
will
tend
to
depreciate
my
own
labour
our
language
falls
far
short
of
the
charms
of
the
italian
both
for
variety
and
harmony
the
latter
is
peculiarly
excellent
for
simple
narrative
it
is
difficult
in
english
to
relate
without
falling
too
low
or
rising
too
high
a
fault
obviously
occasioned
by
the
little
care
taken
to
speak
pure
language
in
common
conversation
every
italian
or
frenchman
of
any
rank
piques
himself
on
speaking
his
own
tongue
correctly
and
with
choice
i
cannot
flatter
myself
with
having
done
justice
to
my
author
in
this
respect
his
style
is
as
elegant
as
his
conduct
of
the
passions
is
masterly
it
is
a
pity
that
he
did
not
apply
his
talents
to
what
they
were
evidently
proper
forâ€”the
theatre
i
will
detain
the
reader
no
longer
but
to
make
one
short
remark
though
the
machinery
is
invention
and
the
names
of
the
actors
imaginary
i
cannot
but
believe
that
the
groundwork
of
the
story
is
founded
on
truth
the
scene
is
undoubtedly
laid
in
some
real
castle
the
author
seems
frequently
without
design
to
describe
particular
parts
â€œthe
chamberâ€
says
he
â€œon
the
right
handâ€
â€œthe
door
on
the
left
handâ€
â€œthe
distance
from
the
chapel
to
conradâ€™s
apartmentâ€
these
and
other
passages
are
strong
presumptions
that
the
author
had
some
certain
building
in
his
eye
curious
persons
who
have
leisure
to
employ
in
such
researches
may
possibly
discover
in
the
italian
writers
the
foundation
on
which
our
author
has
built
if
a
catastrophe
at
all
resembling
that
which
he
describes
is
believed
to
have
given
rise
to
this
work
it
will
contribute
to
interest
the
reader
and
will
make
the
â€œcastle
of
otrantoâ€
a
still
more
moving
story
sonnet

the
right
honourable

gentle

hapless

melancholy

h
w
manfred
prince
of
otranto
had
one
son
and
one
daughter
the
latter
a
most
beautiful
virgin
aged
eighteen
was
called
matilda
conrad
the
son
was
three
years
younger
a
homely
youth
sickly
and
of
no
promising
disposition
yet
he
was
the
darling
of
his
father
who
never
showed
any
symptoms
of
affection
to
matilda
manfred
had
contracted
a
marriage
for
his
son
with
the
marquis
of
vicenzaâ€™s
daughter
isabella
and
she
had
already
been
delivered
by
her
guardians
into
the
hands
of
manfred
that
he
might
celebrate
the
wedding
as
soon
as
conradâ€™s
infirm
state
of
health
would
permit
manfredâ€™s
impatience
for
this
ceremonial
was
remarked
by
his
family
and
neighbours
the
former
indeed
apprehending
the
severity
of
their
princeâ€™s
disposition
did
not
dare
to
utter
their
surmises
on
this
precipitation
hippolita
his
wife
an
amiable
lady
did
sometimes
venture
to
represent
the
danger
of
marrying
their
only
son
so
early
considering
his
great
youth
and
greater
infirmities
but
she
never
received
any
other
answer
than
reflections
on
her
own
sterility
who
had
given
him
but
one
heir
his
tenants
and
subjects
were
less
cautious
in
their
discourses
they
attributed
this
hasty
wedding
to
the
princeâ€™s
dread
of
seeing
accomplished
an
ancient
prophecy
which
was
said
to
have
pronounced
that
the
castle
and
lordship
of
otranto
â€œshould
pass
from
the
present
family
whenever
the
real
owner
should
be
grown
too
large
to
inhabit
itâ€
it
was
difficult
to
make
any
sense
of
this
prophecy
and
still
less
easy
to
conceive
what
it
had
to
do
with
the
marriage
in
question
yet
these
mysteries
or
contradictions
did
not
make
the
populace
adhere
the
less
to
their
opinion
young
conradâ€™s
birthday
was
fixed
for
his
espousals
the
company
was
assembled
in
the
chapel
of
the
castle
and
everything
ready
for
beginning
the
divine
office
when
conrad
himself
was
missing
manfred
impatient
of
the
least
delay
and
who
had
not
observed
his
son
retire
despatched
one
of
his
attendants
to
summon
the
young
prince
the
servant
who
had
not
stayed
long
enough
to
have
crossed
the
court
to
conradâ€™s
apartment
came
running
back
breathless
in
a
frantic
manner
his
eyes
staring
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
he
said
nothing
but
pointed
to
the
court
the
company
were
struck
with
terror
and
amazement
the
princess
hippolita
without
knowing
what
was
the
matter
but
anxious
for
her
son
swooned
away
manfred
less
apprehensive
than
enraged
at
the
procrastination
of
the
nuptials
and
at
the
folly
of
his
domestic
asked
imperiously
what
was
the
matter
the
fellow
made
no
answer
but
continued
pointing
towards
the
courtyard
and
at
last
after
repeated
questions
put
to
him
cried
out
â€œoh
the
helmet
the
helmetâ€
in
the
meantime
some
of
the
company
had
run
into
the
court
from
whence
was
heard
a
confused
noise
of
shrieks
horror
and
surprise
manfred
who
began
to
be
alarmed
at
not
seeing
his
son
went
himself
to
get
information
of
what
occasioned
this
strange
confusion
matilda
remained
endeavouring
to
assist
her
mother
and
isabella
stayed
for
the
same
purpose
and
to
avoid
showing
any
impatience
for
the
bridegroom
for
whom
in
truth
she
had
conceived
little
affection
the
first
thing
that
struck
manfredâ€™s
eyes
was
a
group
of
his
servants
endeavouring
to
raise
something
that
appeared
to
him
a
mountain
of
sable
plumes
he
gazed
without
believing
his
sight
â€œwhat
are
ye
doingâ€
cried
manfred
wrathfully
â€œwhere
is
my
sonâ€
a
volley
of
voices
replied
â€œoh
my
lord
the
prince
the
prince
the
helmet
the
helmetâ€
shocked
with
these
lamentable
sounds
and
dreading
he
knew
not
what
he
advanced
hastilyâ€”but
what
a
sight
for
a
fatherâ€™s
eyesâ€”he
beheld
his
child
dashed
to
pieces
and
almost
buried
under
an
enormous
helmet
an
hundred
times
more
large
than
any
casque
ever
made
for
human
being
and
shaded
with
a
proportionable
quantity
of
black
feathers
the
horror
of
the
spectacle
the
ignorance
of
all
around
how
this
misfortune
had
happened
and
above
all
the
tremendous
phenomenon
before
him
took
away
the
princeâ€™s
speech
yet
his
silence
lasted
longer
than
even
grief
could
occasion
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
what
he
wished
in
vain
to
believe
a
vision
and
seemed
less
attentive
to
his
loss
than
buried
in
meditation
on
the
stupendous
object
that
had
occasioned
it
he
touched
he
examined
the
fatal
casque
nor
could
even
the
bleeding
mangled
remains
of
the
young
prince
divert
the
eyes
of
manfred
from
the
portent
before
him
all
who
had
known
his
partial
fondness
for
young
conrad
were
as
much
surprised
at
their
princeâ€™s
insensibility
as
thunderstruck
themselves
at
the
miracle
of
the
helmet
they
conveyed
the
disfigured
corpse
into
the
hall
without
receiving
the
least
direction
from
manfred
as
little
was
he
attentive
to
the
ladies
who
remained
in
the
chapel
on
the
contrary
without
mentioning
the
unhappy
princesses
his
wife
and
daughter
the
first
sounds
that
dropped
from
manfredâ€™s
lips
were
â€œtake
care
of
the
lady
isabellaâ€
the
domestics
without
observing
the
singularity
of
this
direction
were
guided
by
their
affection
to
their
mistress
to
consider
it
as
peculiarly
addressed
to
her
situation
and
flew
to
her
assistance
they
conveyed
her
to
her
chamber
more
dead
than
alive
and
indifferent
to
all
the
strange
circumstances
she
heard
except
the
death
of
her
son
matilda
who
doted
on
her
mother
smothered
her
own
grief
and
amazement
and
thought
of
nothing
but
assisting
and
comforting
her
afflicted
parent
isabella
who
had
been
treated
by
hippolita
like
a
daughter
and
who
returned
that
tenderness
with
equal
duty
and
affection
was
scarce
less
assiduous
about
the
princess
at
the
same
time
endeavouring
to
partake
and
lessen
the
weight
of
sorrow
which
she
saw
matilda
strove
to
suppress
for
whom
she
had
conceived
the
warmest
sympathy
of
friendship
yet
her
own
situation
could
not
help
finding
its
place
in
her
thoughts
she
felt
no
concern
for
the
death
of
young
conrad
except
commiseration
and
she
was
not
sorry
to
be
delivered
from
a
marriage
which
had
promised
her
little
felicity
either
from
her
destined
bridegroom
or
from
the
severe
temper
of
manfred
who
though
he
had
distinguished
her
by
great
indulgence
had
imprinted
her
mind
with
terror
from
his
causeless
rigour
to
such
amiable
princesses
as
hippolita
and
matilda
while
the
ladies
were
conveying
the
wretched
mother
to
her
bed
manfred
remained
in
the
court
gazing
on
the
ominous
casque
and
regardless
of
the
crowd
which
the
strangeness
of
the
event
had
now
assembled
around
him
the
few
words
he
articulated
tended
solely
to
inquiries
whether
any
man
knew
from
whence
it
could
have
come
nobody
could
give
him
the
least
information
however
as
it
seemed
to
be
the
sole
object
of
his
curiosity
it
soon
became
so
to
the
rest
of
the
spectators
whose
conjectures
were
as
absurd
and
improbable
as
the
catastrophe
itself
was
unprecedented
in
the
midst
of
their
senseless
guesses
a
young
peasant
whom
rumour
had
drawn
thither
from
a
neighbouring
village
observed
that
the
miraculous
helmet
was
exactly
like
that
on
the
figure
in
black
marble
of
alfonso
the
good
one
of
their
former
princes
in
the
church
of
st
nicholas
â€œvillain
what
sayest
thouâ€
cried
manfred
starting
from
his
trance
in
a
tempest
of
rage
and
seizing
the
young
man
by
the
collar
â€œhow
darest
thou
utter
such
treason
thy
life
shall
pay
for
itâ€
the
spectators
who
as
little
comprehended
the
cause
of
the
princeâ€™s
fury
as
all
the
rest
they
had
seen
were
at
a
loss
to
unravel
this
new
circumstance
the
young
peasant
himself
was
still
more
astonished
not
conceiving
how
he
had
offended
the
prince
yet
recollecting
himself
with
a
mixture
of
grace
and
humility
he
disengaged
himself
from
manfredâ€™s
grip
and
then
with
an
obeisance
which
discovered
more
jealousy
of
innocence
than
dismay
he
asked
with
respect
of
what
he
was
guilty
manfred
more
enraged
at
the
vigour
however
decently
exerted
with
which
the
young
man
had
shaken
off
his
hold
than
appeased
by
his
submission
ordered
his
attendants
to
seize
him
and
if
he
had
not
been
withheld
by
his
friends
whom
he
had
invited
to
the
nuptials
would
have
poignarded
the
peasant
in
their
arms
during
this
altercation
some
of
the
vulgar
spectators
had
run
to
the
great
church
which
stood
near
the
castle
and
came
back
open-mouthed
declaring
that
the
helmet
was
missing
from
alfonsoâ€™s
statue
manfred
at
this
news
grew
perfectly
frantic
and
as
if
he
sought
a
subject
on
which
to
vent
the
tempest
within
him
he
rushed
again
on
the
young
peasant
cryingâ€”
â€œvillain
monster
sorcerer
â€™tis
thou
hast
done
this
â€™tis
thou
hast
slain
my
sonâ€
the
mob
who
wanted
some
object
within
the
scope
of
their
capacities
on
whom
they
might
discharge
their
bewildered
reasoning
caught
the
words
from
the
mouth
of
their
lord
and
re-echoedâ€”
â€œay
ay
â€™tis
he
â€™tis
he
he
has
stolen
the
helmet
from
good
alfonsoâ€™s
tomb
and
dashed
out
the
brains
of
our
young
prince
with
itâ€
never
reflecting
how
enormous
the
disproportion
was
between
the
marble
helmet
that
had
been
in
the
church
and
that
of
steel
before
their
eyes
nor
how
impossible
it
was
for
a
youth
seemingly
not
twenty
to
wield
a
piece
of
armour
of
so
prodigious
a
weight
the
folly
of
these
ejaculations
brought
manfred
to
himself
yet
whether
provoked
at
the
peasant
having
observed
the
resemblance
between
the
two
helmets
and
thereby
led
to
the
farther
discovery
of
the
absence
of
that
in
the
church
or
wishing
to
bury
any
such
rumour
under
so
impertinent
a
supposition
he
gravely
pronounced
that
the
young
man
was
certainly
a
necromancer
and
that
till
the
church
could
take
cognisance
of
the
affair
he
would
have
the
magician
whom
they
had
thus
detected
kept
prisoner
under
the
helmet
itself
which
he
ordered
his
attendants
to
raise
and
place
the
young
man
under
it
declaring
he
should
be
kept
there
without
food
with
which
his
own
infernal
art
might
furnish
him
it
was
in
vain
for
the
youth
to
represent
against
this
preposterous
sentence
in
vain
did
manfredâ€™s
friends
endeavour
to
divert
him
from
this
savage
and
ill-grounded
resolution
the
generality
were
charmed
with
their
lordâ€™s
decision
which
to
their
apprehensions
carried
great
appearance
of
justice
as
the
magician
was
to
be
punished
by
the
very
instrument
with
which
he
had
offended
nor
were
they
struck
with
the
least
compunction
at
the
probability
of
the
youth
being
starved
for
they
firmly
believed
that
by
his
diabolic
skill
he
could
easily
supply
himself
with
nutriment
manfred
thus
saw
his
commands
even
cheerfully
obeyed
and
appointing
a
guard
with
strict
orders
to
prevent
any
food
being
conveyed
to
the
prisoner
he
dismissed
his
friends
and
attendants
and
retired
to
his
own
chamber
after
locking
the
gates
of
the
castle
in
which
he
suffered
none
but
his
domestics
to
remain
in
the
meantime
the
care
and
zeal
of
the
young
ladies
had
brought
the
princess
hippolita
to
herself
who
amidst
the
transports
of
her
own
sorrow
frequently
demanded
news
of
her
lord
would
have
dismissed
her
attendants
to
watch
over
him
and
at
last
enjoined
matilda
to
leave
her
and
visit
and
comfort
her
father
matilda
who
wanted
no
affectionate
duty
to
manfred
though
she
trembled
at
his
austerity
obeyed
the
orders
of
hippolita
whom
she
tenderly
recommended
to
isabella
and
inquiring
of
the
domestics
for
her
father
was
informed
that
he
was
retired
to
his
chamber
and
had
commanded
that
nobody
should
have
admittance
to
him
concluding
that
he
was
immersed
in
sorrow
for
the
death
of
her
brother
and
fearing
to
renew
his
tears
by
the
sight
of
his
sole
remaining
child
she
hesitated
whether
she
should
break
in
upon
his
affliction
yet
solicitude
for
him
backed
by
the
commands
of
her
mother
encouraged
her
to
venture
disobeying
the
orders
he
had
given
a
fault
she
had
never
been
guilty
of
before
the
gentle
timidity
of
her
nature
made
her
pause
for
some
minutes
at
his
door
she
heard
him
traverse
his
chamber
backwards
and
forwards
with
disordered
steps
a
mood
which
increased
her
apprehensions
she
was
however
just
going
to
beg
admittance
when
manfred
suddenly
opened
the
door
and
as
it
was
now
twilight
concurring
with
the
disorder
of
his
mind
he
did
not
distinguish
the
person
but
asked
angrily
who
it
was
matilda
replied
tremblingâ€”
â€œmy
dearest
father
it
is
i
your
daughterâ€
manfred
stepping
back
hastily
cried
â€œbegone
i
do
not
want
a
daughterâ€
and
flinging
back
abruptly
clapped
the
door
against
the
terrified
matilda
she
was
too
well
acquainted
with
her
fatherâ€™s
impetuosity
to
venture
a
second
intrusion
when
she
had
a
little
recovered
the
shock
of
so
bitter
a
reception
she
wiped
away
her
tears
to
prevent
the
additional
stab
that
the
knowledge
of
it
would
give
to
hippolita
who
questioned
her
in
the
most
anxious
terms
on
the
health
of
manfred
and
how
he
bore
his
loss
matilda
assured
her
he
was
well
and
supported
his
misfortune
with
manly
fortitude
â€œbut
will
he
not
let
me
see
himâ€
said
hippolita
mournfully
â€œwill
he
not
permit
me
to
blend
my
tears
with
his
and
shed
a
motherâ€™s
sorrows
in
the
bosom
of
her
lord
or
do
you
deceive
me
matilda
i
know
how
manfred
doted
on
his
son
is
not
the
stroke
too
heavy
for
him
has
he
not
sunk
under
it
you
do
not
answer
meâ€”alas
i
dread
the
worstâ€”raise
me
my
maidens
i
will
i
will
see
my
lord
bear
me
to
him
instantly
he
is
dearer
to
me
even
than
my
childrenâ€
matilda
made
signs
to
isabella
to
prevent
hippolitaâ€™s
rising
and
both
those
lovely
young
women
were
using
their
gentle
violence
to
stop
and
calm
the
princess
when
a
servant
on
the
part
of
manfred
arrived
and
told
isabella
that
his
lord
demanded
to
speak
with
her
â€œwith
meâ€
cried
isabella
â€œgoâ€
said
hippolita
relieved
by
a
message
from
her
lord
â€œmanfred
cannot
support
the
sight
of
his
own
family
he
thinks
you
less
disordered
than
we
are
and
dreads
the
shock
of
my
grief
console
him
dear
isabella
and
tell
him
i
will
smother
my
own
anguish
rather
than
add
to
hisâ€
as
it
was
now
evening
the
servant
who
conducted
isabella
bore
a
torch
before
her
when
they
came
to
manfred
who
was
walking
impatiently
about
the
gallery
he
started
and
said
hastilyâ€”
â€œtake
away
that
light
and
begoneâ€
then
shutting
the
door
impetuously
he
flung
himself
upon
a
bench
against
the
wall
and
bade
isabella
sit
by
him
she
obeyed
trembling
â€œi
sent
for
you
ladyâ€
said
heâ€”and
then
stopped
under
great
appearance
of
confusion
â€œmy
lordâ€
â€œyes
i
sent
for
you
on
a
matter
of
great
momentâ€
resumed
he
â€œdry
your
tears
young
ladyâ€”you
have
lost
your
bridegroom
yes
cruel
fate
and
i
have
lost
the
hopes
of
my
race
but
conrad
was
not
worthy
of
your
beautyâ€
â€œhow
my
lordâ€
said
isabella
â€œsure
you
do
not
suspect
me
of
not
feeling
the
concern
i
ought
my
duty
and
affection
would
have
alwaysâ€”â€
â€œthink
no
more
of
himâ€
interrupted
manfred
â€œhe
was
a
sickly
puny
child
and
heaven
has
perhaps
taken
him
away
that
i
might
not
trust
the
honours
of
my
house
on
so
frail
a
foundation
the
line
of
manfred
calls
for
numerous
supports
my
foolish
fondness
for
that
boy
blinded
the
eyes
of
my
prudenceâ€”but
it
is
better
as
it
is
i
hope
in
a
few
years
to
have
reason
to
rejoice
at
the
death
of
conradâ€
words
cannot
paint
the
astonishment
of
isabella
at
first
she
apprehended
that
grief
had
disordered
manfredâ€™s
understanding
her
next
thought
suggested
that
this
strange
discourse
was
designed
to
ensnare
her
she
feared
that
manfred
had
perceived
her
indifference
for
his
son
and
in
consequence
of
that
idea
she
repliedâ€”
â€œgood
my
lord
do
not
doubt
my
tenderness
my
heart
would
have
accompanied
my
hand
conrad
would
have
engrossed
all
my
care
and
wherever
fate
shall
dispose
of
me
i
shall
always
cherish
his
memory
and
regard
your
highness
and
the
virtuous
hippolita
as
my
parentsâ€
â€œcurse
on
hippolitaâ€
cried
manfred
â€œforget
her
from
this
moment
as
i
do
in
short
lady
you
have
missed
a
husband
undeserving
of
your
charms
they
shall
now
be
better
disposed
of
instead
of
a
sickly
boy
you
shall
have
a
husband
in
the
prime
of
his
age
who
will
know
how
to
value
your
beauties
and
who
may
expect
a
numerous
offspringâ€
â€œalas
my
lordâ€
said
isabella
â€œmy
mind
is
too
sadly
engrossed
by
the
recent
catastrophe
in
your
family
to
think
of
another
marriage
if
ever
my

returns
and
it
shall
be
his
pleasure
i
shall
obey
as
i
did
when
i
consented
to
give
my
hand
to
your
son
but
until
his
return
permit
me
to
remain
under
your
hospitable
roof
and
employ
the
melancholy
hours
in
assuaging
yours
hippolitaâ€™s
and
the
fair
matildaâ€™s
afflictionâ€
â€œi
desired
you
once
beforeâ€
said
manfred
angrily
â€œnot
to
name
that
woman
from
this
hour
she
must
be
a
stranger
to
you
as
she
must
be
to

short
isabella
since
i
cannot
give
you
my
son
i
offer
you
myselfâ€
â€œheavensâ€
cried
isabella
waking
from
her
delusion
â€œwhat
do
i
hear
you
my
lord
you
my
father-in-law
the
father
of
conrad
the
husband
of
the
virtuous
and
tender
hippolitaâ€
â€œi
tell
youâ€
said
manfred
imperiously
â€œhippolita
is
no
longer
my
wife
i
divorce
her
from
this
hour
too
long
has
she
cursed
me
by
her
unfruitfulness
my
fate
depends
on
having
sons
and
this
night
i
trust
will
give
a
new
date
to
my
hopesâ€
at
those
words
he
seized
the
cold
hand
of
isabella
who
was
half
dead
with
fright
and
horror
she
shrieked
and
started
from
him
manfred
rose
to
pursue
her
when
the
moon
which
was
now
up
and
gleamed
in
at
the
opposite
casement
presented
to
his
sight
the
plumes
of
the
fatal
helmet
which
rose
to
the
height
of
the
windows
waving
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
tempestuous
manner
and
accompanied
with
a
hollow
and
rustling
sound
isabella
who
gathered
courage
from
her
situation
and
who
dreaded
nothing
so
much
as
manfredâ€™s
pursuit
of
his
declaration
criedâ€”
â€œlook
my
lord
see
heaven
itself
declares
against
your
impious
intentionsâ€
â€œheaven
nor
hell
shall
impede
my
designsâ€
said
manfred
advancing
again
to
seize
the
princess
at
that
instant
the
portrait
of
his
grandfather
which
hung
over
the
bench
where
they
had
been
sitting
uttered
a
deep
sigh
and
heaved
its
breast
isabella
whose
back
was
turned
to
the
picture
saw
not
the
motion
nor
knew
whence
the
sound
came
but
started
and
saidâ€”
â€œhark
my
lord
what
sound
was
thatâ€
and
at
the
same
time
made
towards
the
door
manfred
distracted
between
the
flight
of
isabella
who
had
now
reached
the
stairs
and
yet
unable
to
keep
his
eyes
from
the
picture
which
began
to
move
had
however
advanced
some
steps
after
her
still
looking
backwards
on
the
portrait
when
he
saw
it
quit
its
panel
and
descend
on
the
floor
with
a
grave
and
melancholy
air
â€œdo
i
dreamâ€
cried
manfred
returning
â€œor
are
the
devils
themselves
in
league
against
me

internal
spectre

if
thou
art
my
grandsire
why
dost
thou
too
conspire
against
thy
wretched
descendant
who
too
dearly
pays
forâ€”â€
ere
he
could
finish
the
sentence
the
vision
sighed
again
and
made
a
sign
to
manfred
to
follow
him
â€œlead
onâ€
cried
manfred
â€œi
will
follow
thee
to
the
gulf
of
perditionâ€
the
spectre
marched
sedately
but
dejected
to
the
end
of
the
gallery
and
turned
into
a
chamber
on
the
right
hand
manfred
accompanied
him
at
a
little
distance
full
of
anxiety
and
horror
but
resolved
as
he
would
have
entered
the
chamber
the
door
was
clapped
to
with
violence
by
an
invisible
hand
the
prince
collecting
courage
from
this
delay
would
have
forcibly
burst
open
the
door
with
his
foot
but
found
that
it
resisted
his
utmost
efforts
â€œsince
hell
will
not
satisfy
my
curiosityâ€
said
manfred
â€œi
will
use
the
human
means
in
my
power
for
preserving
my
race
isabella
shall
not
escape
meâ€
the
lady
whose
resolution
had
given
way
to
terror
the
moment
she
had
quitted
manfred
continued
her
flight
to
the
bottom
of
the
principal
staircase
there
she
stopped
not
knowing
whither
to
direct
her
steps
nor
how
to
escape
from
the
impetuosity
of
the
prince
the
gates
of
the
castle
she
knew
were
locked
and
guards
placed
in
the
court
should
she
as
her
heart
prompted
her
go
and
prepare
hippolita
for
the
cruel
destiny
that
awaited
her
she
did
not
doubt
but
manfred
would
seek
her
there
and
that
his
violence
would
incite
him
to
double
the
injury
he
meditated
without
leaving
room
for
them
to
avoid
the
impetuosity
of
his
passions
delay
might
give
him
time
to
reflect
on
the
horrid
measures
he
had
conceived
or
produce
some
circumstance
in
her
favour
if
she
couldâ€”for
that
night
at
leastâ€”avoid
his
odious
purpose
yet
where
conceal
herself
how
avoid
the
pursuit
he
would
infallibly
make
throughout
the
castle
as
these
thoughts
passed
rapidly
through
her
mind
she
recollected
a
subterraneous
passage
which
led
from
the
vaults
of
the
castle
to
the
church
of
st
nicholas
could
she
reach
the
altar
before
she
was
overtaken
she
knew
even
manfredâ€™s
violence
would
not
dare
to
profane
the
sacredness
of
the
place
and
she
determined
if
no
other
means
of
deliverance
offered
to
shut
herself
up
for
ever
among
the
holy
virgins
whose
convent
was
contiguous
to
the
cathedral
in
this
resolution
she
seized
a
lamp
that
burned
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
hurried
towards
the
secret
passage
the
lower
part
of
the
castle
was
hollowed
into
several
intricate
cloisters
and
it
was
not
easy
for
one
under
so
much
anxiety
to
find
the
door
that
opened
into
the
cavern
an
awful
silence
reigned
throughout
those
subterraneous
regions
except
now
and
then
some
blasts
of
wind
that
shook
the
doors
she
had
passed
and
which
grating
on
the
rusty
hinges
were
re-echoed
through
that
long
labyrinth
of
darkness
every
murmur
struck
her
with
new
terror
yet
more
she
dreaded
to
hear
the
wrathful
voice
of
manfred
urging
his
domestics
to
pursue
her
she
trod
as
softly
as
impatience
would
give
her
leave
yet
frequently
stopped
and
listened
to
hear
if
she
was
followed
in
one
of
those
moments
she
thought
she
heard
a
sigh
she
shuddered
and
recoiled
a
few
paces
in
a
moment
she
thought
she
heard
the
step
of
some
person
her
blood
curdled
she
concluded
it
was
manfred
every
suggestion
that
horror
could
inspire
rushed
into
her
mind
she
condemned
her
rash
flight
which
had
thus
exposed
her
to
his
rage
in
a
place
where
her
cries
were
not
likely
to
draw
anybody
to
her
assistance
yet
the
sound
seemed
not
to
come
from
behind
if
manfred
knew
where
she
was
he
must
have
followed
her
she
was
still
in
one
of
the
cloisters
and
the
steps
she
had
heard
were
too
distinct
to
proceed
from
the
way
she
had
come
cheered
with
this
reflection
and
hoping
to
find
a
friend
in
whoever
was
not
the
prince
she
was
going
to
advance
when
a
door
that
stood
ajar
at
some
distance
to
the
left
was
opened
gently
but
ere
her
lamp
which
she
held
up
could
discover
who
opened
it
the
person
retreated
precipitately
on
seeing
the
light
isabella
whom
every
incident
was
sufficient
to
dismay
hesitated
whether
she
should
proceed
her
dread
of
manfred
soon
outweighed
every
other
terror
the
very
circumstance
of
the
person
avoiding
her
gave
her
a
sort
of
courage
it
could
only
be
she
thought
some
domestic
belonging
to
the
castle
her
gentleness
had
never
raised
her
an
enemy
and
conscious
innocence
made
her
hope
that
unless
sent
by
the
princeâ€™s
order
to
seek
her
his
servants
would
rather
assist
than
prevent
her
flight
fortifying
herself
with
these
reflections
and
believing
by
what
she
could
observe
that
she
was
near
the
mouth
of
the
subterraneous
cavern
she
approached
the
door
that
had
been
opened
but
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
that
met
her
at
the
door
extinguished
her
lamp
and
left
her
in
total
darkness
words
cannot
paint
the
horror
of
the
princessâ€™s
situation
alone
in
so
dismal
a
place
her
mind
imprinted
with
all
the
terrible
events
of
the
day
hopeless
of
escaping
expecting
every
moment
the
arrival
of
manfred
and
far
from
tranquil
on
knowing
she
was
within
reach
of
somebody
she
knew
not
whom
who
for
some
cause
seemed
concealed
thereabouts
all
these
thoughts
crowded
on
her
distracted
mind
and
she
was
ready
to
sink
under
her
apprehensions
she
addressed
herself
to
every
saint
in
heaven
and
inwardly
implored
their
assistance
for
a
considerable
time
she
remained
in
an
agony
of
despair
at
last
as
softly
as
was
possible
she
felt
for
the
door
and
having
found
it
entered
trembling
into
the
vault
from
whence
she
had
heard
the
sigh
and
steps
it
gave
her
a
kind
of
momentary
joy
to
perceive
an
imperfect
ray
of
clouded
moonshine
gleam
from
the
roof
of
the
vault
which
seemed
to
be
fallen
in
and
from
whence
hung
a
fragment
of
earth
or
building
she
could
not
distinguish
which
that
appeared
to
have
been
crushed
inwards
she
advanced
eagerly
towards
this
chasm
when
she
discerned
a
human
form
standing
close
against
the
wall
she
shrieked
believing
it
the
ghost
of
her
betrothed
conrad
the
figure
advancing
said
in
a
submissive
voiceâ€”
â€œbe
not
alarmed
lady
i
will
not
injure
youâ€
isabella
a
little
encouraged
by
the
words
and
tone
of
voice
of
the
stranger
and
recollecting
that
this
must
be
the
person
who
had
opened
the
door
recovered
her
spirits
enough
to
replyâ€”
â€œsir
whoever
you
are
take
pity
on
a
wretched
princess
standing
on
the
brink
of
destruction
assist
me
to
escape
from
this
fatal
castle
or
in
a
few
moments
i
may
be
made
miserable
for
everâ€
â€œalasâ€
said
the
stranger
â€œwhat
can
i
do
to
assist
you
i
will
die
in
your
defence
but
i
am
unacquainted
with
the
castle
and
wantâ€”â€
â€œohâ€
said
isabella
hastily
interrupting
him
â€œhelp
me
but
to
find
a
trap-door
that
must
be
hereabout
and
it
is
the
greatest
service
you
can
do
me
for
i
have
not
a
minute
to
loseâ€
saying
a
these
words
she
felt
about
on
the
pavement
and
directed
the
stranger
to
search
likewise
for
a
smooth
piece
of
brass
enclosed
in
one
of
the
stones
â€œthatâ€
said
she
â€œis
the
lock
which
opens
with
a
spring
of
which
i
know
the
secret
if
we
can
find
that
i
may
escapeâ€”if
not
alas
courteous
stranger
i
fear
i
shall
have
involved
you
in
my
misfortunes
manfred
will
suspect
you
for
the
accomplice
of
my
flight
and
you
will
fall
a
victim
to
his
resentmentâ€
â€œi
value
not
my
lifeâ€
said
the
stranger
â€œand
it
will
be
some
comfort
to
lose
it
in
trying
to
deliver
you
from
his
tyrannyâ€
â€œgenerous
youthâ€
said
isabella
â€œhow
shall
i
ever
requiteâ€”â€
as
she
uttered
those
words
a
ray
of
moonshine
streaming
through
a
cranny
of
the
ruin
above
shone
directly
on
the
lock
they
sought
â€œoh
transportâ€
said
isabella
â€œhere
is
the
trap-doorâ€
and
taking
out
the
key
she
touched
the
spring
which
starting
aside
discovered
an
iron
ring
â€œlift
up
the
doorâ€
said
the
princess
the
stranger
obeyed
and
beneath
appeared
some
stone
steps
descending
into
a
vault
totally
dark
â€œwe
must
go
down
hereâ€
said
isabella
â€œfollow
me
dark
and
dismal
as
it
is
we
cannot
miss
our
way
it
leads
directly
to
the
church
of
st
nicholas
but
perhapsâ€
added
the
princess
modestly
â€œyou
have
no
reason
to
leave
the
castle
nor
have
i
farther
occasion
for
your
service
in
a
few
minutes
i
shall
be
safe
from
manfredâ€™s
rageâ€”only
let
me
know
to
whom
i
am
so
much
obligedâ€
â€œi
will
never
quit
youâ€
said
the
stranger
eagerly
â€œuntil
i
have
placed
you
in
safetyâ€”nor
think
me
princess
more
generous
than
i
am
though
you
are
my
principal
careâ€”â€
the
stranger
was
interrupted
by
a
sudden
noise
of
voices
that
seemed
approaching
and
they
soon
distinguished
these
wordsâ€”
â€œtalk
not
to
me
of
necromancers
i
tell
you
she
must
be
in
the
castle
i
will
find
her
in
spite
of
enchantmentâ€
â€œoh
heavensâ€
cried
isabella
â€œit
is
the
voice
of
manfred
make
haste
or
we
are
ruined
and
shut
the
trap-door
after
youâ€
saying
this
she
descended
the
steps
precipitately
and
as
the
stranger
hastened
to
follow
her
he
let
the
door
slip
out
of
his
hands
it
fell
and
the
spring
closed
over
it
he
tried
in
vain
to
open
it
not
having
observed
isabellaâ€™s
method
of
touching
the
spring
nor
had
he
many
moments
to
make
an
essay
the
noise
of
the
falling
door
had
been
heard
by
manfred
who
directed
by
the
sound
hastened
thither
attended
by
his
servants
with
torches
â€œit
must
be
isabellaâ€
cried
manfred
before
he
entered
the
vault
â€œshe
is
escaping
by
the
subterraneous
passage
but
she
cannot
have
got
farâ€
what
was
the
astonishment
of
the
prince
when
instead
of
isabella
the
light
of
the
torches
discovered
to
him
the
young
peasant
whom
he
thought
confined
under
the
fatal
helmet
â€œtraitorâ€
said
manfred
â€œhow
camest
thou
here
i
thought
thee
in
durance
above
in
the
courtâ€
â€œi
am
no
traitorâ€
replied
the
young
man
boldly
â€œnor
am
i
answerable
for
your
thoughtsâ€
â€œpresumptuous
villainâ€
cried
manfred
â€œdost
thou
provoke
my
wrath
tell
me
how
hast
thou
escaped
from
above
thou
hast
corrupted
thy
guards
and
their
lives
shall
answer
itâ€
â€œmy
povertyâ€
said
the
peasant
calmly
â€œwill
disculpate
them
though
the
ministers
of
a
tyrantâ€™s
wrath
to
thee
they
are
faithful
and
but
too
willing
to
execute
the
orders
which
you
unjustly
imposed
upon
themâ€
â€œart
thou
so
hardy
as
to
dare
my
vengeanceâ€
said
the
prince
â€œbut
tortures
shall
force
the
truth
from
thee
tell
me
i
will
know
thy
accomplicesâ€
â€œthere
was
my
accompliceâ€
said
the
youth
smiling
and
pointing
to
the
roof
manfred
ordered
the
torches
to
be
held
up
and
perceived
that
one
of
the
cheeks
of
the
enchanted
casque
had
forced
its
way
through
the
pavement
of
the
court
as
his
servants
had
let
it
fall
over
the
peasant
and
had
broken
through
into
the
vault
leaving
a
gap
through
which
the
peasant
had
pressed
himself
some
minutes
before
he
was
found
by
isabella
â€œwas
that
the
way
by
which
thou
didst
descendâ€
said
manfred
â€œit
wasâ€
said
the
youth
â€œbut
what
noise
was
thatâ€
said
manfred
â€œwhich
i
heard
as
i
entered
the
cloisterâ€
â€œa
door
clappedâ€
said
the
peasant
â€œi
heard
it
as
well
as
youâ€
â€œwhat
doorâ€
said
manfred
hastily
â€œi
am
not
acquainted
with
your
castleâ€
said
the
peasant
â€œthis
is
the
first
time
i
ever
entered
it
and
this
vault
the
only
part
of
it
within
which
i
ever
wasâ€
â€œbut
i
tell
theeâ€
said
manfred
wishing
to
find
out
if
the
youth
had
discovered
the
trap-door
â€œit
was
this
way
i
heard
the
noise
my
servants
heard
it
tooâ€
â€œmy
lordâ€
interrupted
one
of
them
officiously
â€œto
be
sure
it
was
the
trap-door
and
he
was
going
to
make
his
escapeâ€
â€œpeace
blockheadâ€
said
the
prince
angrily
â€œif
he
was
going
to
escape
how
should
he
come
on
this
side
i
will
know
from
his
own
mouth
what
noise
it
was
i
heard
tell
me
truly
thy
life
depends
on
thy
veracityâ€
â€œmy
veracity
is
dearer
to
me
than
my
lifeâ€
said
the
peasant
â€œnor
would
i
purchase
the
one
by
forfeiting
the
otherâ€
â€œindeed
young
philosopherâ€
said
manfred
contemptuously
â€œtell
me
then
what
was
the
noise
i
heardâ€
â€œask
me
what
i
can
answerâ€
said
he
â€œand
put
me
to
death
instantly
if
i
tell
you
a
lieâ€
manfred
growing
impatient
at
the
steady
valour
and
indifference
of
the
youth
criedâ€”
â€œwell
then
thou
man
of
truth
answer
was
it
the
fall
of
the
trap-door
that
i
heardâ€
â€œit
wasâ€
said
the
youth
â€œit
wasâ€
said
the
prince
â€œand
how
didst
thou
come
to
know
there
was
a
trap-door
hereâ€
â€œi
saw
the
plate
of
brass
by
a
gleam
of
moonshineâ€
replied
he
â€œbut
what
told
thee
it
was
a
lockâ€
said
manfred
â€œhow
didst
thou
discover
the
secret
of
opening
itâ€
â€œprovidence
that
delivered
me
from
the
helmet
was
able
to
direct
me
to
the
spring
of
a
lockâ€
said
he
â€œprovidence
should
have
gone
a
little
farther
and
have
placed
thee
out
of
the
reach
of
my
resentmentâ€
said
manfred
â€œwhen
providence
had
taught
thee
to
open
the
lock
it
abandoned
thee
for
a
fool
who
did
not
know
how
to
make
use
of
its
favours
why
didst
thou
not
pursue
the
path
pointed
out
for
thy
escape
why
didst
thou
shut
the
trap-door
before
thou
hadst
descended
the
stepsâ€
â€œi
might
ask
you
my
lordâ€
said
the
peasant
â€œhow
i
totally
unacquainted
with
your
castle
was
to
know
that
those
steps
led
to
any
outlet
but
i
scorn
to
evade
your
questions
wherever
those
steps
lead
to
perhaps
i
should
have
explored
the
wayâ€”i
could
not
be
in
a
worse
situation
than
i
was
but
the
truth
is
i
let
the
trap-door
fall
your
immediate
arrival
followed
i
had
given
the
alarmâ€”what
imported
it
to
me
whether
i
was
seized
a
minute
sooner
or
a
minute
laterâ€
â€œthou
art
a
resolute
villain
for
thy
yearsâ€
said
manfred
â€œyet
on
reflection
i
suspect
thou
dost
but
trifle
with
me
thou
hast
not
yet
told
me
how
thou
didst
open
the
lockâ€
â€œthat
i
will
show
you
my
lordâ€
said
the
peasant
and
taking
up
a
fragment
of
stone
that
had
fallen
from
above
he
laid
himself
on
the
trap-door
and
began
to
beat
on
the
piece
of
brass
that
covered
it
meaning
to
gain
time
for
the
escape
of
the
princess
this
presence
of
mind
joined
to
the
frankness
of
the
youth
staggered
manfred
he
even
felt
a
disposition
towards
pardoning
one
who
had
been
guilty
of
no
crime
manfred
was
not
one
of
those
savage
tyrants
who
wanton
in
cruelty
unprovoked
the
circumstances
of
his
fortune
had
given
an
asperity
to
his
temper
which
was
naturally
humane
and
his
virtues
were
always
ready
to
operate
when
his
passions
did
not
obscure
his
reason
while
the
prince
was
in
this
suspense
a
confused
noise
of
voices
echoed
through
the
distant
vaults
as
the
sound
approached
he
distinguished
the
clamours
of
some
of
his
domestics
whom
he
had
dispersed
through
the
castle
in
search
of
isabella
calling
outâ€”
â€œwhere
is
my
lord
where
is
the
princeâ€
â€œhere
i
amâ€
said
manfred
as
they
came
nearer
â€œhave
you
found
the
princessâ€
the
first
that
arrived
replied
â€œoh
my
lord
i
am
glad
we
have
found
youâ€
â€œfound
meâ€
said
manfred
â€œhave
you
found
the
princessâ€
â€œwe
thought
we
had
my
lordâ€
said
the
fellow
looking
terrified
â€œbutâ€”â€
â€œbut
whatâ€
cried
the
prince
â€œhas
she
escapedâ€
â€œjaquez
and
i
my
lordâ€”â€
â€œyes
i
and
diegoâ€
interrupted
the
second
who
came
up
in
still
greater
consternation
â€œspeak
one
of
you
at
a
timeâ€
said
manfred
â€œi
ask
you
where
is
the
princessâ€
â€œwe
do
not
knowâ€
said
they
both
together
â€œbut
we
are
frightened
out
of
our
witsâ€
â€œso
i
think
blockheadsâ€
said
manfred
â€œwhat
is
it
has
scared
you
thusâ€
â€œoh
my
lordâ€
said
jaquez
â€œdiego
has
seen
such
a
sight
your
highness
would
not
believe
our
eyesâ€
â€œwhat
new
absurdity
is
thisâ€
cried
manfred
â€œgive
me
a
direct
answer
or
by
heavenâ€”â€
â€œwhy
my
lord
if
it
please
your
highness
to
hear
meâ€
said
the
poor
fellow
â€œdiego
and
iâ€”â€
â€œyes
i
and
jaquezâ€”â€
cried
his
comrade
â€œdid
not
i
forbid
you
to
speak
both
at
a
timeâ€
said
the
prince
â€œyou
jaquez
answer
for
the
other
fool
seems
more
distracted
than
thou
art
what
is
the
matterâ€
â€œmy
gracious
lordâ€
said
jaquez
â€œif
it
please
your
highness
to
hear
me
diego
and
i
according
to
your
highnessâ€™s
orders
went
to
search
for
the
young
lady
but
being
comprehensive
that
we
might
meet
the
ghost
of
my
young
lord
your
highnessâ€™s
son
god
rest
his
soul
as
he
has
not
received
christian
burialâ€”â€
â€œsotâ€
cried
manfred
in
a
rage
â€œis
it
only
a
ghost
then
that
thou
hast
seenâ€
â€œoh
worse
worse
my
lordâ€
cried
diego
â€œi
had
rather
have
seen
ten
whole
ghostsâ€
â€œgrant
me
patienceâ€
said
manfred
â€œthese
blockheads
distract
me
out
of
my
sight
diego
and
thou
jaquez
tell
me
in
one
word
art
thou
sober
art
thou
raving
thou
wast
wont
to
have
some
sense
has
the
other
sot
frightened
himself
and
thee
too
speak
what
is
it
he
fancies
he
has
seenâ€
â€œwhy
my
lordâ€
replied
jaquez
trembling
â€œi
was
going
to
tell
your
highness
that
since
the
calamitous
misfortune
of
my
young
lord
god
rest
his
precious
soul
not
one
of
us
your
highnessâ€™s
faithful
servantsâ€”indeed
we
are
my
lord
though
poor
menâ€”i
say
not
one
of
us
has
dared
to
set
a
foot
about
the
castle
but
two
together
so
diego
and
i
thinking
that
my
young
lady
might
be
in
the
great
gallery
went
up
there
to
look
for
her
and
tell
her
your
highness
wanted
something
to
impart
to
herâ€
â€œo
blundering
foolsâ€
cried
manfred
â€œand
in
the
meantime
she
has
made
her
escape
because
you
were
afraid
of
goblinsâ€”why
thou
knave
she
left
me
in
the
gallery
i
came
from
thence
myselfâ€
â€œfor
all
that
she
may
be
there
still
for
aught
i
knowâ€
said
jaquez
â€œbut
the
devil
shall
have
me
before
i
seek
her
there
againâ€”poor
diego
i
do
not
believe
he
will
ever
recover
itâ€
â€œrecover
whatâ€
said
manfred
â€œam
i
never
to
learn
what
it
is
has
terrified
these
rascalsâ€”but
i
lose
my
time
follow
me
slave
i
will
see
if
she
is
in
the
galleryâ€
â€œfor
heavenâ€™s
sake
my
dear
good
lordâ€
cried
jaquez
â€œdo
not
go
to
the
gallery
satan
himself
i
believe
is
in
the
chamber
next
to
the
galleryâ€
manfred
who
hitherto
had
treated
the
terror
of
his
servants
as
an
idle
panic
was
struck
at
this
new
circumstance
he
recollected
the
apparition
of
the
portrait
and
the
sudden
closing
of
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
his
voice
faltered
and
he
asked
with
disorderâ€”
â€œwhat
is
in
the
great
chamberâ€
â€œmy
lordâ€
said
jaquez
â€œwhen
diego
and
i
came
into
the
gallery
he
went
first
for
he
said
he
had
more
courage
than
i
so
when
we
came
into
the
gallery
we
found
nobody
we
looked
under
every
bench
and
stool
and
still
we
found
nobodyâ€
â€œwere
all
the
pictures
in
their
placesâ€
said
manfred
â€œyes
my
lordâ€
answered
jaquez
â€œbut
we
did
not
think
of
looking
behind
themâ€
â€œwell
wellâ€
said
manfred
â€œproceedâ€
â€œwhen
we
came
to
the
door
of
the
great
chamberâ€
continued
jaquez
â€œwe
found
it
shutâ€
â€œand
could
not
you
open
itâ€
said
manfred
â€œoh
yes
my
lord
would
to
heaven
we
had
notâ€
replied
heâ€”â€œnay
it
was
not
i
neither
it
was
diego
he
was
grown
foolhardy
and
would
go
on
though
i
advised
him
notâ€”if
ever
i
open
a
door
that
is
shut
againâ€”â€
â€œtrifle
notâ€
said
manfred
shuddering
â€œbut
tell
me
what
you
saw
in
the
great
chamber
on
opening
the
doorâ€
â€œi
my
lordâ€
said
jaquez
â€œi
was
behind
diego
but
i
heard
the
noiseâ€
â€œjaquezâ€
said
manfred
in
a
solemn
tone
of
voice
â€œtell
me
i
adjure
thee
by
the
souls
of
my
ancestors
what
was
it
thou
sawest
what
was
it
thou
heardestâ€
â€œit
was
diego
saw
it
my
lord
it
was
not
iâ€
replied
jaquez
â€œi
only
heard
the
noise
diego
had
no
sooner
opened
the
door
than
he
cried
out
and
ran
back
i
ran
back
too
and
said
â€˜is
it
the
ghostâ€™
â€˜the
ghost
no
noâ€™
said
diego
and
his
hair
stood
on
endâ€”â€˜it
is
a
giant
i
believe
he
is
all
clad
in
armour
for
i
saw
his
foot
and
part
of
his
leg
and
they
are
as
large
as
the
helmet
below
in
the
courtâ€™
as
he
said
these
words
my
lord
we
heard
a
violent
motion
and
the
rattling
of
armour
as
if
the
giant
was
rising
for
diego
has
told
me
since
that
he
believes
the
giant
was
lying
down
for
the
foot
and
leg
were
stretched
at
length
on
the
floor
before
we
could
get
to
the
end
of
the
gallery
we
heard
the
door
of
the
great
chamber
clap
behind
us
but
we
did
not
dare
turn
back
to
see
if
the
giant
was
following
usâ€”yet
now
i
think
on
it
we
must
have
heard
him
if
he
had
pursued
usâ€”but
for
heavenâ€™s
sake
good
my
lord
send
for
the
chaplain
and
have
the
castle
exorcised
for
for
certain
it
is
enchantedâ€
â€œay
pray
do
my
lordâ€
cried
all
the
servants
at
once
â€œor
we
must
leave
your
highnessâ€™s
serviceâ€
â€œpeace
dotardsâ€
said
manfred
â€œand
follow
me
i
will
know
what
all
this
meansâ€
â€œwe
my
lordâ€
cried
they
with
one
voice
â€œwe
would
not
go
up
to
the
gallery
for
your
highnessâ€™s
revenueâ€
the
young
peasant
who
had
stood
silent
now
spoke
â€œwill
your
highnessâ€
said
he
â€œpermit
me
to
try
this
adventure
my
life
is
of
consequence
to
nobody
i
fear
no
bad
angel
and
have
offended
no
good
oneâ€
â€œyour
behaviour
is
above
your
seemingâ€
said
manfred
viewing
him
with
surprise
and
admirationâ€”â€œhereafter
i
will
reward
your
braveryâ€”but
nowâ€
continued
he
with
a
sigh
â€œi
am
so
circumstanced
that
i
dare
trust
no
eyes
but
my
own
however
i
give
you
leave
to
accompany
meâ€
manfred
when
he
first
followed
isabella
from
the
gallery
had
gone
directly
to
the
apartment
of
his
wife
concluding
the
princess
had
retired
thither
hippolita
who
knew
his
step
rose
with
anxious
fondness
to
meet
her
lord
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
the
death
of
their
son
she
would
have
flown
in
a
transport
mixed
of
joy
and
grief
to
his
bosom
but
he
pushed
her
rudely
off
and
saidâ€”
â€œwhere
is
isabellaâ€
â€œisabella
my
lordâ€
said
the
astonished
hippolita
â€œyes
isabellaâ€
cried
manfred
imperiously
â€œi
want
isabellaâ€
â€œmy
lordâ€
replied
matilda
who
perceived
how
much
his
behaviour
had
shocked
her
mother
â€œshe
has
not
been
with
us
since
your
highness
summoned
her
to
your
apartmentâ€
â€œtell
me
where
she
isâ€
said
the
prince
â€œi
do
not
want
to
know
where
she
has
beenâ€
â€œmy
good
lordâ€
says
hippolita
â€œyour
daughter
tells
you
the
truth
isabella
left
us
by
your
command
and
has
not
returned
sinceâ€”but
my
good
lord
compose
yourself
retire
to
your
rest
this
dismal
day
has
disordered
you
isabella
shall
wait
your
orders
in
the
morningâ€
â€œwhat
then
you
know
where
she
isâ€
cried
manfred
â€œtell
me
directly
for
i
will
not
lose
an
instantâ€”and
you
womanâ€
speaking
to
his
wife
â€œorder
your
chaplain
to
attend
me
forthwithâ€
â€œisabellaâ€
said
hippolita
calmly
â€œis
retired
i
suppose
to
her
chamber
she
is
not
accustomed
to
watch
at
this
late
hour
gracious
my
lordâ€
continued
she
â€œlet
me
know
what
has
disturbed
you
has
isabella
offended
youâ€
â€œtrouble
me
not
with
questionsâ€
said
manfred
â€œbut
tell
me
where
she
isâ€
â€œmatilda
shall
call
herâ€
said
the
princess
â€œsit
down
my
lord
and
resume
your
wonted
fortitudeâ€
â€œwhat
art
thou
jealous
of
isabellaâ€
replied
he
â€œthat
you
wish
to
be
present
at
our
interviewâ€
â€œgood
heavens
my
lordâ€
said
hippolita
â€œwhat
is
it
your
highness
meansâ€
â€œthou
wilt
know
ere
many
minutes
are
passedâ€
said
the
cruel
prince
â€œsend
your
chaplain
to
me
and
wait
my
pleasure
hereâ€
at
these
words
he
flung
out
of
the
room
in
search
of
isabella
leaving
the
amazed
ladies
thunderstruck
with
his
words
and
frantic
deportment
and
lost
in
vain
conjectures
on
what
he
was
meditating
manfred
was
now
returning
from
the
vault
attended
by
the
peasant
and
a
few
of
his
servants
whom
he
had
obliged
to
accompany
him
he
ascended
the
staircase
without
stopping
till
he
arrived
at
the
gallery
at
the
door
of
which
he
met
hippolita
and
her
chaplain
when
diego
had
been
dismissed
by
manfred
he
had
gone
directly
to
the
princessâ€™s
apartment
with
the
alarm
of
what
he
had
seen
that
excellent
lady
who
no
more
than
manfred
doubted
of
the
reality
of
the
vision
yet
affected
to
treat
it
as
a
delirium
of
the
servant
willing
however
to
save
her
lord
from
any
additional
shock
and
prepared
by
a
series
of
griefs
not
to
tremble
at
any
accession
to
it
she
determined
to
make
herself
the
first
sacrifice
if
fate
had
marked
the
present
hour
for
their
destruction
dismissing
the
reluctant
matilda
to
her
rest
who
in
vain
sued
for
leave
to
accompany
her
mother
and
attended
only
by
her
chaplain
hippolita
had
visited
the
gallery
and
great
chamber
and
now
with
more
serenity
of
soul
than
she
had
felt
for
many
hours
she
met
her
lord
and
assured
him
that
the
vision
of
the
gigantic
leg
and
foot
was
all
a
fable
and
no
doubt
an
impression
made
by
fear
and
the
dark
and
dismal
hour
of
the
night
on
the
minds
of
his
servants
she
and
the
chaplain
had
examined
the
chamber
and
found
everything
in
the
usual
order
manfred
though
persuaded
like
his
wife
that
the
vision
had
been
no
work
of
fancy
recovered
a
little
from
the
tempest
of
mind
into
which
so
many
strange
events
had
thrown
him
ashamed
too
of
his
inhuman
treatment
of
a
princess
who
returned
every
injury
with
new
marks
of
tenderness
and
duty
he
felt
returning
love
forcing
itself
into
his
eyes
but
not
less
ashamed
of
feeling
remorse
towards
one
against
whom
he
was
inwardly
meditating
a
yet
more
bitter
outrage
he
curbed
the
yearnings
of
his
heart
and
did
not
dare
to
lean
even
towards
pity
the
next
transition
of
his
soul
was
to
exquisite
villainy
presuming
on
the
unshaken
submission
of
hippolita
he
flattered
himself
that
she
would
not
only
acquiesce
with
patience
to
a
divorce
but
would
obey
if
it
was
his
pleasure
in
endeavouring
to
persuade
isabella
to
give
him
her
handâ€”but
ere
he
could
indulge
his
horrid
hope
he
reflected
that
isabella
was
not
to
be
found
coming
to
himself
he
gave
orders
that
every
avenue
to
the
castle
should
be
strictly
guarded
and
charged
his
domestics
on
pain
of
their
lives
to
suffer
nobody
to
pass
out
the
young
peasant
to
whom
he
spoke
favourably
he
ordered
to
remain
in
a
small
chamber
on
the
stairs
in
which
there
was
a
pallet-bed
and
the
key
of
which
he
took
away
himself
telling
the
youth
he
would
talk
with
him
in
the
morning
then
dismissing
his
attendants
and
bestowing
a
sullen
kind
of
half-nod
on
hippolita
he
retired
to
his
own
chamber
matilda
who
by
hippolitaâ€™s
order
had
retired
to
her
apartment
was
ill-disposed
to
take
any
rest
the
shocking
fate
of
her
brother
had
deeply
affected
her
she
was
surprised
at
not
seeing
isabella
but
the
strange
words
which
had
fallen
from
her
father
and
his
obscure
menace
to
the
princess
his
wife
accompanied
by
the
most
furious
behaviour
had
filled
her
gentle
mind
with
terror
and
alarm
she
waited
anxiously
for
the
return
of
bianca
a
young
damsel
that
attended
her
whom
she
had
sent
to
learn
what
was
become
of
isabella
bianca
soon
appeared
and
informed
her
mistress
of
what
she
had
gathered
from
the
servants
that
isabella
was
nowhere
to
be
found
she
related
the
adventure
of
the
young
peasant
who
had
been
discovered
in
the
vault
though
with
many
simple
additions
from
the
incoherent
accounts
of
the
domestics
and
she
dwelt
principally
on
the
gigantic
leg
and
foot
which
had
been
seen
in
the
gallery-chamber
this
last
circumstance
had
terrified
bianca
so
much
that
she
was
rejoiced
when
matilda
told
her
that
she
would
not
go
to
rest
but
would
watch
till
the
princess
should
rise
the
young
princess
wearied
herself
in
conjectures
on
the
flight
of
isabella
and
on
the
threats
of
manfred
to
her
mother
â€œbut
what
business
could
he
have
so
urgent
with
the
chaplainâ€
said
matilda
â€œdoes
he
intend
to
have
my
brotherâ€™s
body
interred
privately
in
the
chapelâ€
â€œoh
madamâ€
said
bianca
â€œnow
i
guess
as
you
are
become
his
heiress
he
is
impatient
to
have
you
married
he
has
always
been
raving
for
more
sons
i
warrant
he
is
now
impatient
for
grandsons
as
sure
as
i
live
madam
i
shall
see
you
a
bride
at
lastâ€”good
madam
you
wonâ€™t
cast
off
your
faithful
bianca
you
wonâ€™t
put
donna
rosara
over
me
now
you
are
a
great
princessâ€
â€œmy
poor
biancaâ€
said
matilda
â€œhow
fast
your
thoughts
amble
i
a
great
princess
what
hast
thou
seen
in
manfredâ€™s
behaviour
since
my
brotherâ€™s
death
that
bespeaks
any
increase
of
tenderness
to
me
no
bianca
his
heart
was
ever
a
stranger
to
meâ€”but
he
is
my
father
and
i
must
not
complain
nay
if
heaven
shuts
my
fatherâ€™s
heart
against
me
it
overpays
my
little
merit
in
the
tenderness
of
my
motherâ€”o
that
dear
mother
yes
bianca
â€™tis
there
i
feel
the
rugged
temper
of
manfred
i
can
support
his
harshness
to
me
with
patience
but
it
wounds
my
soul
when
i
am
witness
to
his
causeless
severity
towards
herâ€
â€œoh
madamâ€
said
bianca
â€œall
men
use
their
wives
so
when
they
are
weary
of
themâ€
â€œand
yet
you
congratulated
me
but
nowâ€
said
matilda
â€œwhen
you
fancied
my
father
intended
to
dispose
of
meâ€
â€œi
would
have
you
a
great
ladyâ€
replied
bianca
â€œcome
what
will
i
do
not
wish
to
see
you
moped
in
a
convent
as
you
would
be
if
you
had
your
will
and
if
my
lady
your
mother
who
knows
that
a
bad
husband
is
better
than
no
husband
at
all
did
not
hinder
youâ€”bless
me
what
noise
is
that
st
nicholas
forgive
me
i
was
but
in
jestâ€
â€œit
is
the
windâ€
said
matilda
â€œwhistling
through
the
battlements
in
the
tower
above
you
have
heard
it
a
thousand
timesâ€
â€œnayâ€
said
bianca
â€œthere
was
no
harm
neither
in
what
i
said
it
is
no
sin
to
talk
of
matrimonyâ€”and
so
madam
as
i
was
saying
if
my
lord
manfred
should
offer
you
a
handsome
young
prince
for
a
bridegroom
you
would
drop
him
a
curtsey
and
tell
him
you
would
rather
take
the
veilâ€
â€œthank
heaven
i
am
in
no
such
dangerâ€
said
matilda
â€œyou
know
how
many
proposals
for
me
he
has
rejectedâ€”â€
â€œand
you
thank
him
like
a
dutiful
daughter
do
you
madam
but
come
madam
suppose
to-morrow
morning
he
was
to
send
for
you
to
the
great
council
chamber
and
there
you
should
find
at
his
elbow
a
lovely
young
prince
with
large
black
eyes
a
smooth
white
forehead
and
manly
curling
locks
like
jet
in
short
madam
a
young
hero
resembling
the
picture
of
the
good
alfonso
in
the
gallery
which
you
sit
and
gaze
at
for
hours
togetherâ€”â€
â€œdo
not
speak
lightly
of
that
pictureâ€
interrupted
matilda
sighing
â€œi
know
the
adoration
with
which
i
look
at
that
picture
is
uncommonâ€”but
i
am
not
in
love
with
a
coloured
panel
the
character
of
that
virtuous
prince
the
veneration
with
which
my
mother
has
inspired
me
for
his
memory
the
orisons
which
i
know
not
why
she
has
enjoined
me
to
pour
forth
at
his
tomb
all
have
concurred
to
persuade
me
that
somehow
or
other
my
destiny
is
linked
with
something
relating
to
himâ€
â€œlord
madam
how
should
that
beâ€
said
bianca
â€œi
have
always
heard
that
your
family
was
in
no
way
related
to
his
and
i
am
sure
i
cannot
conceive
why
my
lady
the
princess
sends
you
in
a
cold
morning
or
a
damp
evening
to
pray
at
his
tomb
he
is
no
saint
by
the
almanack
if
you
must
pray
why
does
she
not
bid
you
address
yourself
to
our
great
st
nicholas
i
am
sure
he
is
the
saint
i
pray
to
for
a
husbandâ€
â€œperhaps
my
mind
would
be
less
affectedâ€
said
matilda
â€œif
my
mother
would
explain
her
reasons
to
me
but
it
is
the
mystery
she
observes
that
inspires
me
with
thisâ€”i
know
not
what
to
call
it
as
she
never
acts
from
caprice
i
am
sure
there
is
some
fatal
secret
at
bottomâ€”nay
i
know
there
is
in
her
agony
of
grief
for
my
brotherâ€™s
death
she
dropped
some
words
that
intimated
as
muchâ€
â€œoh
dear
madamâ€
cried
bianca
â€œwhat
were
theyâ€
â€œnoâ€
said
matilda
â€œif
a
parent
lets
fall
a
word
and
wishes
it
recalled
it
is
not
for
a
child
to
utter
itâ€
â€œwhat
was
she
sorry
for
what
she
had
saidâ€
asked
bianca
â€œi
am
sure
madam
you
may
trust
meâ€”â€
â€œwith
my
own
little
secrets
when
i
have
any
i
mayâ€
said
matilda
â€œbut
never
with
my
motherâ€™s
a
child
ought
to
have
no
ears
or
eyes
but
as
a
parent
directsâ€
â€œwell
to
be
sure
madam
you
were
born
to
be
a
saintâ€
said
bianca
â€œand
there
is
no
resisting
oneâ€™s
vocation
you
will
end
in
a
convent
at
last
but
there
is
my
lady
isabella
would
not
be
so
reserved
to
me
she
will
let
me
talk
to
her
of
young
men
and
when
a
handsome
cavalier
has
come
to
the
castle
she
has
owned
to
me
that
she
wished
your
brother
conrad
resembled
himâ€
â€œbiancaâ€
said
the
princess
â€œi
do
not
allow
you
to
mention
my
friend
disrespectfully
isabella
is
of
a
cheerful
disposition
but
her
soul
is
pure
as
virtue
itself
she
knows
your
idle
babbling
humour
and
perhaps
has
now
and
then
encouraged
it
to
divert
melancholy
and
enliven
the
solitude
in
which
my
father
keeps
usâ€”â€
â€œblessed
maryâ€
said
bianca
starting
â€œthere
it
is
again
dear
madam
do
you
hear
nothing
this
castle
is
certainly
hauntedâ€
â€œpeaceâ€
said
matilda
â€œand
listen
i
did
think
i
heard
a
voiceâ€”but
it
must
be
fancy
your
terrors
i
suppose
have
infected
meâ€
â€œindeed
indeed
madamâ€
said
bianca
half-weeping
with
agony
â€œi
am
sure
i
heard
a
voiceâ€
â€œdoes
anybody
lie
in
the
chamber
beneathâ€
said
the
princess
â€œnobody
has
dared
to
lie
thereâ€
answered
bianca
â€œsince
the
great
astrologer
that
was
your
brotherâ€™s
tutor
drowned
himself
for
certain
madam
his
ghost
and
the
young
princeâ€™s
are
now
met
in
the
chamber
belowâ€”for
heavenâ€™s
sake
let
us
fly
to
your
motherâ€™s
apartmentâ€
â€œi
charge
you
not
to
stirâ€
said
matilda
â€œif
they
are
spirits
in
pain
we
may
ease
their
sufferings
by
questioning
them
they
can
mean
no
hurt
to
us
for
we
have
not
injured
themâ€”and
if
they
should
shall
we
be
more
safe
in
one
chamber
than
in
another
reach
me
my
beads
we
will
say
a
prayer
and
then
speak
to
themâ€
â€œoh
dear
lady
i
would
not
speak
to
a
ghost
for
the
worldâ€
cried
bianca
as
she
said
those
words
they
heard
the
casement
of
the
little
chamber
below
matildaâ€™s
open
they
listened
attentively
and
in
a
few
minutes
thought
they
heard
a
person
sing
but
could
not
distinguish
the
words
â€œthis
can
be
no
evil
spiritâ€
said
the
princess
in
a
low
voice
â€œit
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
familyâ€”open
the
window
and
we
shall
know
the
voiceâ€
â€œi
dare
not
indeed
madamâ€
said
bianca
â€œthou
art
a
very
foolâ€
said
matilda
opening
the
window
gently
herself
the
noise
the
princess
made
was
however
heard
by
the
person
beneath
who
stopped
and
they
concluded
had
heard
the
casement
open
â€œis
anybody
belowâ€
said
the
princess
â€œif
there
is
speakâ€
â€œyesâ€
said
an
unknown
voice
â€œwho
is
itâ€
said
matilda
â€œa
strangerâ€
replied
the
voice
â€œwhat
strangerâ€
said
she
â€œand
how
didst
thou
come
there
at
this
unusual
hour
when
all
the
gates
of
the
castle
are
lockedâ€
â€œi
am
not
here
willinglyâ€
answered
the
voice
â€œbut
pardon
me
lady
if
i
have
disturbed
your
rest
i
knew
not
that
i
was
overheard
sleep
had
forsaken
me
i
left
a
restless
couch
and
came
to
waste
the
irksome
hours
with
gazing
on
the
fair
approach
of
morning
impatient
to
be
dismissed
from
this
castleâ€
â€œthy
words
and
accentsâ€
said
matilda
â€œare
of
melancholy
cast
if
thou
art
unhappy
i
pity
thee
if
poverty
afflicts
thee
let
me
know
it
i
will
mention
thee
to
the
princess
whose
beneficent
soul
ever
melts
for
the
distressed
and
she
will
relieve
theeâ€
â€œi
am
indeed
unhappyâ€
said
the
stranger
â€œand
i
know
not
what
wealth
is
but
i
do
not
complain
of
the
lot
which
heaven
has
cast
for
me
i
am
young
and
healthy
and
am
not
ashamed
of
owing
my
support
to
myselfâ€”yet
think
me
not
proud
or
that
i
disdain
your
generous
offers
i
will
remember
you
in
my
orisons
and
will
pray
for
blessings
on
your
gracious
self
and
your
noble
mistressâ€”if
i
sigh
lady
it
is
for
others
not
for
myselfâ€
â€œnow
i
have
it
madamâ€
said
bianca
whispering
the
princess
â€œthis
is
certainly
the
young
peasant
and
by
my
conscience
he
is
in
loveâ€”well
this
is
a
charming
adventureâ€”do
madam
let
us
sift
him
he
does
not
know
you
but
takes
you
for
one
of
my
lady
hippolitaâ€™s
womenâ€
â€œart
thou
not
ashamed
biancaâ€
said
the
princess
â€œwhat
right
have
we
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
this
young
manâ€™s
heart
he
seems
virtuous
and
frank
and
tells
us
he
is
unhappy
are
those
circumstances
that
authorise
us
to
make
a
property
of
him
how
are
we
entitled
to
his
confidenceâ€
â€œlord
madam
how
little
you
know
of
loveâ€
replied
bianca
â€œwhy
lovers
have
no
pleasure
equal
to
talking
of
their
mistressâ€
â€œand
would
you
have
me
become
a
peasantâ€™s
confidanteâ€
said
the
princess
â€œwell
then
let
me
talk
to
himâ€
said
bianca
â€œthough
i
have
the
honour
of
being
your
highnessâ€™s
maid
of
honour
i
was
not
always
so
great
besides
if
love
levels
ranks
it
raises
them
too
i
have
a
respect
for
any
young
man
in
loveâ€
â€œpeace
simpletonâ€
said
the
princess
â€œthough
he
said
he
was
unhappy
it
does
not
follow
that
he
must
be
in
love
think
of
all
that
has
happened
to-day
and
tell
me
if
there
are
no
misfortunes
but
what
love
causesâ€”strangerâ€
resumed
the
princess
â€œif
thy
misfortunes
have
not
been
occasioned
by
thy
own
fault
and
are
within
the
compass
of
the
princess
hippolitaâ€™s
power
to
redress
i
will
take
upon
me
to
answer
that
she
will
be
thy
protectress
when
thou
art
dismissed
from
this
castle
repair
to
holy
father
jerome
at
the
convent
adjoining
to
the
church
of
st
nicholas
and
make
thy
story
known
to
him
as
far
as
thou
thinkest
meet
he
will
not
fail
to
inform
the
princess
who
is
the
mother
of
all
that
want
her
assistance
farewell
it
is
not
seemly
for
me
to
hold
farther
converse
with
a
man
at
this
unwonted
hourâ€
â€œmay
the
saints
guard
thee
gracious
ladyâ€
replied
the
peasant
â€œbut
oh
if
a
poor
and
worthless
stranger
might
presume
to
beg
a
minuteâ€™s
audience
farther
am
i
so
happy
the
casement
is
not
shut
might
i
venture
to
askâ€”â€
â€œspeak
quicklyâ€
said
matilda
â€œthe
morning
dawns
apace
should
the
labourers
come
into
the
fields
and
perceive
usâ€”what
wouldst
thou
askâ€
â€œi
know
not
how
i
know
not
if
i
dareâ€
said
the
young
stranger
faltering
â€œyet
the
humanity
with
which
you
have
spoken
to
me
emboldensâ€”lady
dare
i
trust
youâ€
â€œheavensâ€
said
matilda
â€œwhat
dost
thou
mean
with
what
wouldst
thou
trust
me
speak
boldly
if
thy
secret
is
fit
to
be
entrusted
to
a
virtuous
breastâ€
â€œi
would
askâ€
said
the
peasant
recollecting
himself
â€œwhether
what
i
have
heard
from
the
domestics
is
true
that
the
princess
is
missing
from
the
castleâ€
â€œwhat
imports
it
to
thee
to
knowâ€
replied
matilda
â€œthy
first
words
bespoke
a
prudent
and
becoming
gravity
dost
thou
come
hither
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
manfred
adieu
i
have
been
mistaken
in
theeâ€
saying
these
words
she
shut
the
casement
hastily
without
giving
the
young
man
time
to
reply
â€œi
had
acted
more
wiselyâ€
said
the
princess
to
bianca
with
some
sharpness
â€œif
i
had
let
thee
converse
with
this
peasant
his
inquisitiveness
seems
of
a
piece
with
thy
ownâ€
â€œit
is
not
fit
for
me
to
argue
with
your
highnessâ€
replied
bianca
â€œbut
perhaps
the
questions
i
should
have
put
to
him
would
have
been
more
to
the
purpose
than
those
you
have
been
pleased
to
ask
himâ€
â€œoh
no
doubtâ€
said
matilda
â€œyou
are
a
very
discreet
personage
may
i
know
what
you
would
have
asked
himâ€
â€œa
bystander
often
sees
more
of
the
game
than
those
that
playâ€
answered
bianca
â€œdoes
your
highness
think
madam
that
this
question
about
my
lady
isabella
was
the
result
of
mere
curiosity
no
no
madam
there
is
more
in
it
than
you
great
folks
are
aware
of
lopez
told
me
that
all
the
servants
believe
this
young
fellow
contrived
my
lady
isabellaâ€™s
escape
now
pray
madam
observe
you
and
i
both
know
that
my
lady
isabella
never
much
fancied
the
prince
your
brother
well
he
is
killed
just
in
a
critical
minuteâ€”i
accuse
nobody
a
helmet
falls
from
the
moonâ€”so
my
lord
your
father
says
but
lopez
and
all
the
servants
say
that
this
young
spark
is
a
magician
and
stole
it
from
alfonsoâ€™s
tombâ€”â€
â€œhave
done
with
this
rhapsody
of
impertinenceâ€
said
matilda
â€œnay
madam
as
you
pleaseâ€
cried
bianca
â€œyet
it
is
very
particular
though
that
my
lady
isabella
should
be
missing
the
very
same
day
and
that
this
young
sorcerer
should
be
found
at
the
mouth
of
the
trap-door
i
accuse
nobody
but
if
my
young
lord
came
honestly
by
his
deathâ€”â€
â€œdare
not
on
thy
dutyâ€
said
matilda
â€œto
breathe
a
suspicion
on
the
purity
of
my
dear
isabellaâ€™s
fameâ€
â€œpurity
or
not
purityâ€
said
bianca
â€œgone
she
isâ€”a
stranger
is
found
that
nobody
knows
you
question
him
yourself
he
tells
you
he
is
in
love
or
unhappy
it
is
the
same
thingâ€”nay
he
owned
he
was
unhappy
about
others
and
is
anybody
unhappy
about
another
unless
they
are
in
love
with
them
and
at
the
very
next
word
he
asks
innocently
pour
soul
if
my
lady
isabella
is
missingâ€
â€œto
be
sureâ€
said
matilda
â€œthy
observations
are
not
totally
without
foundationâ€”isabellaâ€™s
flight
amazes
me
the
curiosity
of
the
stranger
is
very
particular
yet
isabella
never
concealed
a
thought
from
meâ€
â€œso
she
told
youâ€
said
bianca
â€œto
fish
out
your
secrets
but
who
knows
madam
but
this
stranger
may
be
some
prince
in
disguise
do
madam
let
me
open
the
window
and
ask
him
a
few
questionsâ€
â€œnoâ€
replied
matilda
â€œi
will
ask
him
myself
if
he
knows
aught
of
isabella
he
is
not
worthy
i
should
converse
farther
with
himâ€
she
was
going
to
open
the
casement
when
they
heard
the
bell
ring
at
the
postern-gate
of
the
castle
which
is
on
the
right
hand
of
the
tower
where
matilda
lay
this
prevented
the
princess
from
renewing
the
conversation
with
the
stranger
after
continuing
silent
for
some
time
â€œi
am
persuadedâ€
said
she
to
bianca
â€œthat
whatever
be
the
cause
of
isabellaâ€™s
flight
it
had
no
unworthy
motive
if
this
stranger
was
accessory
to
it
she
must
be
satisfied
with
his
fidelity
and
worth
i
observed
did
not
you
bianca
that
his
words
were
tinctured
with
an
uncommon
infusion
of
piety
it
was
no
ruffianâ€™s
speech
his
phrases
were
becoming
a
man
of
gentle
birthâ€
â€œi
told
you
madamâ€
said
bianca
â€œthat
i
was
sure
he
was
some
prince
in
disguiseâ€
â€œyetâ€
said
matilda
â€œif
he
was
privy
to
her
escape
how
will
you
account
for
his
not
accompanying
her
in
her
flight
why

resentmentâ€
â€œas
for
that
madamâ€
replied
she
â€œif
he
could
get
from

will
find

of
eluding

but
he
has
some
talisman

about
himâ€
â€œyou
resolve
everything
into
magicâ€
said
matilda
â€œbut
a
man
who
has
any

not
dare
to
make
use
of
those
tremendous
and

words
which
he
uttered
didst
thou
not
observe
with
what
fervour
he
vowed
to
remember
me
to
heaven
in
his
prayers
yes
isabella
was
undoubtedly
convinced
of
his
pietyâ€
â€œcommend
me
to
the
piety
of
a
young
fellow

a
damsel
that
consult
to
elopeâ€
said
bianca
â€œno
no
madam
my
lady
isabella
is
of
another
guess
mould
than
you
take
her
for
she
used
indeed
to
sigh
and
lift
up
her
eyes
in
your
company
because
she
knows
you
are
a
saint
but
when
your
back
was
turnedâ€”â€
â€œyou
wrong
herâ€
said
matilda
â€œisabella
is
no
hypocrite
she
has
a
due
sense
of
devotion
but
never
affected
a
call
she
has
not
on
the
contrary
she
always
combated
my
inclination
for
the
cloister
and
though
i
own
the
mystery
she
has
made
to
me
of
her
flight
confounds
me
though
it
seems
inconsistent
with
the
friendship
between
us
i
cannot
forget
the
disinterested
warmth
with
which
she
always
opposed
my
taking
the
veil
she
wished
to
see
me
married
though
my
dower
would
have
been
a
loss
to
her

my

said
bianca
while
she
was
speaking
a
servant
came
hastily
into
the
chamber
and
told
the
princess
that
the
lady
isabella
was
found
â€œwhereâ€
said
matilda
â€œshe
has
taken
sanctuary
in
st

manfred
had
risen
at
the
first
dawn
of
light
and
gone
to
hippolitaâ€™s
apartment
to
inquire
if
she
knew
aught
of
isabella

he
was
questioning
her
word
was
brought

jerome
demanded
to
speak
with
him
manfred
little
suspecting
the
cause
of
the
friarâ€™s
arrival
and
knowing
he
was
employed
by
hippolita
in
her
charities
ordered
him
to
be
admitted
intending
to
leave
them
together
while
he
pursued
his
search
after
isabella
â€œis
your
business
with
me
or
the
princessâ€

manfred
â€œwith
bothâ€
replied
the
holy
man
â€œthe

isabellaâ€”â€
â€œwhat
of
herâ€
interrupted
manfred
eagerly
â€œis
at

jerome
â€œthat

the
good

with
an
air

firmness

daunted
even
the
resolute
manfred
who
could
not
help
revering
the
saint-like

of

first
my

the

hippolita
â€œdoes

manfred
â€œi

manfred
trembled
with
rage
and
shame
hippolitaâ€™s
countenance
declared
her
astonishment
and
impatience
to
know
where
this
would
end
her
silence
more
strongly
spoke
her
observance
of
manfred

â€œyou

alas

you

of

your
divine
exhortations

commenced

how
cutting
was
the
anguish
which
the
good
man
felt
when
he
perceived
this
turn
in
the
wily
prince
he
trembled
for
hippolita
whose
ruin
he
saw
was
determined
and
he
feared
if
manfred
had
no
hope
of
recovering
isabella
that
his
impatience
for
a
son
would
direct
him
to
some
other
object
who
might
not
be
equally
proof
against
the
temptation
of
manfredâ€™s
rank
for
some
time
the
holy
man
remained
absorbed
in
thought
at
length
conceiving
some
hopes
from
delay
he
thought
the
wisest
conduct
would
be
to
prevent
the
prince
from
despairing
of
recovering
isabella
her
the
friar
knew
he
could
dispose
from
her
affection
to
hippolita
and
from
the
aversion
she
had
expressed
to
him
for
manfredâ€™s
addresses
to
second
his
views
till
the
censures
of
the
church
could
be
fulminated
against
a
divorce
with
this
intention
as
if
struck
with
the
princeâ€™s
scruples
he
at
length
said
â€œmy
lord
i
have
been
pondering
on
what
your
highness
has
said
and
if
in
truth
it
is
delicacy
of
conscience

is
the
real
motive
of
your
repugnance
to
your
virtuous
lady
far
be
it
from
me
to
endeavour
to
harden
your
heart
the
church
is
an
indulgent
mother
unfold
your
griefs
to
her
she
alone
can
administer
comfort
to
your
soul
either
by
satisfying
your
conscience
or
upon
examination
of
your
scruples
by
setting
you
at
liberty
and
indulging
you
in
the
lawful
means
of
continuing
your
lineage
in
the
latter
case
if
the
lady
isabella
can
be
brought
to
consentâ€”â€
manfred
who
concluded
that
he
had
either
over-reached
the
good
man
or
that
his
first
warmth
had
been
but
a
tribute
paid
to
appearance
was
overjoyed
at
this
sudden
turn
and
repeated
the
most
magnificent
promises
if
he
should
succeed
by
the
friarâ€™s
mediation
the
well-meaning
priest
suffered
him
to
deceive
himself
fully
determined
to
traverse
his
views
instead
of
seconding
them
â€œsince
we
now
understand
one
anotherâ€
resumed
the
prince
â€œi
expect

that
you
satisfy
me
in
one
point

i

in

have
been
privy
to
isabellaâ€™s
flight
tell
me
truly
is
he
her
lover
or
is
he
an
agent
for
anotherâ€™s
passion
i
have
often
suspected
isabellaâ€™s
indifference
to
my
son
a
thousand
circumstances
crowd
on
my
mind
that
confirm
that
suspicion
she
herself
was
so
conscious
of
it
that
while
i
discoursed
her
in
the
gallery
she
outran
my
suspicious
and
endeavoured
to
justify
herself
from
coolness
to
conradâ€
the
friar
who
knew
nothing
of
the
youth

what
he
had
learnt
occasionally
from
the
princess
ignorant
what
was
become
of
him
and
not
sufficiently
reflecting
on
the
impetuosity
of
manfredâ€™s
temper
conceived
that
it
might
not
be
amiss
to
sow
the
seeds
of
jealousy
in
his
mind
they
might
be
turned
to
some
use
hereafter
either
by
prejudicing
the
prince
against
isabella
if
he
persisted
in
that
union
or
by
diverting
his
attention
to
a
wrong
scent
and
employing
his
thoughts
on
a
visionary
intrigue
prevent
his
engaging
in
any
new
pursuit
with
this
unhappy
policy
he
answered
in
a
manner
to
confirm
manfred
in
the
belief
of
some
connection
between
isabella
and
the
youth
the
prince
whose
passions
wanted
little
fuel
to
throw
them
into
a
blaze
fell
into
a
rage
at
the
idea
of
what
the
friar
suggested
â€œi
will
fathom
to
the
bottom
of
this
intrigueâ€
cried
he
and
quitting
jerome
abruptly
with
a
command
to
remain
there
till
his
return
he
hastened
to
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
and
ordered
the
peasant
to
be
brought
before
him
â€œthou
hardened
young
impostorâ€
said
the
prince
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
youth
â€œwhat
becomes
of
thy
boasted
veracity
now
it
was
providence
was
it
and
the
light
of
the
moon
that
discovered
the
lock
of
the
trap-door
to
thee
tell
me
audacious
boy
who
thou
art
and
how
long
thou
hast
been
acquainted
with
the
princessâ€”and
take
care
to
answer
with
less
equivocation
than
thou
didst
last
night
or
tortures
shall
wring
the
truth
from
theeâ€
the
young
man
perceiving
that
his
share
in
the
flight
of
the
princess
was
discovered
and
concluding
that
anything
he
should
say
could
no
longer
be
of
any
service
or
detriment
to
her
repliedâ€”
â€œi
am
no
impostor
my
lord
nor
have
i
deserved
opprobrious
language
i
answered
to
every
question
your
highness
put
to
me
last
night
with
the
same
veracity
that
i
shall
speak
now
and
that
will
not
be
from
fear
of
your
tortures
but
because
my
soul
abhors
a
falsehood
please
to
repeat
your
questions
my
lord
i
am
ready
to
give
you
all
the
satisfaction
in
my
powerâ€
â€œyou
know
my
questionsâ€
replied
the
prince
â€œand
only
want
time
to
prepare
an
evasion
speak
directly
who
art
thou
and
how
long
hast
thou
been
known
to
the
princessâ€
â€œi
am
a
labourer
at
the
next
villageâ€
said
the
peasant
â€œmy
name
is
theodore
the
princess
found
me
in
the
vault
last
night
before
that
hour
i
never
was
in
her
presenceâ€
â€œi
may
believe
as
much
or
as
little
as
i
please
of
thisâ€
said
manfred
â€œbut
i
will
hear
thy
own
story
before
i
examine
into
the
truth
of
it
tell
me
what
reason
did
the
princess
give
thee
for
making
her
escape
thy
life
depends
on
thy
answerâ€
â€œshe
told
meâ€
replied
theodore
â€œthat
she
was
on
the
brink
of
destruction
and
that
if
she
could
not
escape
from
the
castle
she
was
in
danger
in
a
few
moments
of
being
made
miserable
for
everâ€
â€œand
on
this
slight
foundation
on
a
silly
girlâ€™s
reportâ€
said
manfred
â€œthou
didst
hazard
my
displeasureâ€
â€œi
fear
no
manâ€™s
displeasureâ€
said
theodore
â€œwhen
a
woman
in
distress
puts
herself
under
my
protectionâ€
during
this
examination
matilda
was
going
to
the
apartment
of
hippolita
at
the
upper
end
of
the
hall
where
manfred
sat
was
a
boarded
gallery
with
latticed
windows
through
which
matilda
and
bianca
were
to
pass
hearing
her
fatherâ€™s
voice
and
seeing
the
servants
assembled
round
him
she
stopped
to
learn
the
occasion
the
prisoner
soon
drew
her
attention
the
steady
and
composed
manner
in
which
he
answered
and
the
gallantry
of
his
last
reply
which
were
the
first
words
she
heard
distinctly
interested
her
in
his
flavour
his
person
was
noble
handsome
and
commanding
even
in
that
situation
but
his
countenance
soon
engrossed
her
whole
care
â€œheavens
biancaâ€
said
the
princess
softly
â€œdo
i
dream
or
is
not
that
youth
the
exact
resemblance
of
alfonsoâ€™s
picture
in
the
galleryâ€
she
could
say
no
more
for
her
fatherâ€™s
voice
grew
louder
at
every
word
â€œthis
bravadoâ€
said
he
â€œsurpasses
all
thy
former
insolence
thou
shalt
experience
the
wrath
with
which
thou
darest
to
trifle
seize
himâ€
continued
manfred
â€œand
bind
himâ€”the
first
news
the
princess
hears
of
her
champion
shall
be
that
he
has
lost
his
head
for
her
sakeâ€
â€œthe
injustice
of
which
thou
art
guilty
towards
meâ€
said
theodore
â€œconvinces
me
that
i
have
done
a
good
deed
in
delivering
the
princess
from
thy
tyranny
may
she
be
happy
whatever
becomes
of
meâ€
â€œthis
is
a
loverâ€
cried
manfred
in
a
rage
â€œa
peasant
within
sight
of
death
is
not
animated
by
such
sentiments
tell
me
tell
me
rash
boy
who
thou
art
or
the
rack
shall
force
thy
secret
from
theeâ€
â€œthou
hast
threatened
me
with
death
alreadyâ€
said
the
youth
â€œfor
the
truth
i
have
told
thee
if
that
is
all
the
encouragement
i
am
to
expect
for
sincerity
i
am
not
tempted
to
indulge
thy
vain
curiosity
fartherâ€
â€œthen
thou
wilt
not
speakâ€
said
manfred
â€œi
will
notâ€
replied
he
â€œbear
him
away
into
the
courtyardâ€
said
manfred
â€œi
will
see
his
head
this
instant
severed
from
his
bodyâ€
matilda
fainted
at
hearing
those
words
bianca
shrieked
and
criedâ€”
â€œhelp
help
the
princess
is
deadâ€
manfred
started
at
this
ejaculation
and
demanded
what
was
the
matter
the
young
peasant
who
heard
it
too
was
struck
with
horror
and
asked
eagerly
the
same
question
but
manfred
ordered
him
to
be
hurried
into
the
court
and
kept
there
for
execution
till
he
had
informed
himself
of
the
cause
of
biancaâ€™s
shrieks
when
he
learned
the
meaning
he
treated
it
as
a
womanish
panic
and
ordering
matilda
to
be
carried
to
her
apartment
he
rushed
into
the
court
and
calling
for
one
of
his
guards
bade
theodore
kneel
down
and
prepare
to
receive
the
fatal
blow
the
undaunted
youth
received
the
bitter
sentence
with
a
resignation
that
touched
every
heart
but
manfredâ€™s
he
wished
earnestly
to
know
the
meaning
of
the
words
he
had
heard
relating
to
the
princess
but
fearing
to
exasperate
the
tyrant
more
against
her
he
desisted
the
only
boon
he
deigned
to
ask
was
that
he
might
be
permitted
to
have
a
confessor
and
make
his
peace
with
heaven
manfred
who
hoped
by
the
confessorâ€™s
means
to
come
at
the
youthâ€™s
history
readily
granted
his
request
and
being
convinced
that
father
jerome
was
now
in
his
interest
he
ordered
him
to
be
called
and
shrive
the
prisoner
the
holy
man
who
had
little
foreseen
the
catastrophe
that
his
imprudence
occasioned
fell
on
his
knees
to
the
prince
and
adjured
him
in
the
most
solemn
manner
not
to
shed
innocent
blood
he
accused
himself
in
the
bitterest
terms
for
his
indiscretion
endeavoured
to
disculpate
the
youth
and
left
no
method
untried
to
soften
the
tyrantâ€™s
rage
manfred
more
incensed
than
appeased
by
jeromeâ€™s
intercession
whose
retraction
now
made
him
suspect
he
had
been
imposed
upon
by
both
commanded
the
friar
to
do
his
duty
telling
him
he
would
not
allow
the
prisoner
many
minutes
for
confession
â€œnor
do
i
ask
many
my
lordâ€
said
the
unhappy
young
man
â€œmy
sins
thank
heaven
have
not
been
numerous
nor
exceed
what
might
be
expected
at
my
years
dry
your
tears

let
us
despatch

a
bad
world
nor
have
i
had
cause
to
leave
it
with
regretâ€
â€œoh
wretched
youthâ€
said
jerome
â€œhow
canst
thou
bear
the
sight
of
me
with
patience
i
am
thy
murderer
it
is
i
have
brought
this
dismal
hour
upon
theeâ€
â€œi
forgive
thee
from

said
the
youth
â€œas
i
hope
heaven
will
pardon

and
give
me
thy
blessingâ€
â€œhow
can
i
prepare
thee
for
thy
passage
as
i
oughtâ€
said
jerome
â€œthou
canst
not
be
saved
without
pardoning
thy
foesâ€”and
canst
thou
forgive
that
impious
man
thereâ€
â€œi
canâ€
said
theodore
â€œi
doâ€
â€œand
does
not
this
touch
thee
cruel
princeâ€
said
the
friar
â€œi
sent
for
thee
to
confess
himâ€
said
manfred
sternly
â€œnot
to
plead
for
him
thou
didst
first
incense
me
against
himâ€”his
blood
be
upon
thy
headâ€
â€œit
will
it
willâ€
said
the
good
man
in
an
agony
of
sorrow
â€œthou
and
i
must
never
hope
to
go
where
this
blessed
youth
is
goingâ€
â€œdespatchâ€
said
manfred
â€œi
am
no
more
to
be
moved
by
the
whining
of
priests
than
by
the
shrieks
of
womenâ€
â€œwhatâ€
said
the
youth
â€œis
it
possible
that
my
fate
could
have
occasioned
what
i
heard
is
the
princess
then
again
in
thy
powerâ€
â€œthou
dost
but
remember
me
of
my
wrathâ€
said
manfred
â€œprepare
thee
for
this
moment
is
thy
lastâ€
the
youth
who
felt
his
indignation
rise
and
who
was
touched
with
the
sorrow
which
he
saw
he
had
infused
into
all
the
spectators
as
well
as
into
the
friar
suppressed
his
emotions
and
putting
off
his
doublet
and
unbuttoning
his
collar
knelt
down
to
his
prayers
as
he
stooped
his
shirt
slipped
down
below
his
shoulder
and
discovered
the
mark
of
a
bloody
arrow
â€œgracious
heavenâ€
cried
the
holy
man
starting
â€œwhat
do
i
see
it
is
my
child
my
theodoreâ€
the
passions
that
ensued
must
be
conceived
they
cannot
be
painted
the
tears
of
the
assistants
were
suspended
by
wonder
rather
than
stopped
by
joy
they
seemed
to
inquire
in
the
eyes
of
their
lord
what
they
ought
to
feel
surprise
doubt
tenderness
respect
succeeded
each
other
in
the
countenance
of
the
youth
he
received
with
modest
submission
the
effusion
of
the
old
manâ€™s
tears
and
embraces
yet
afraid
of
giving
a
loose
to
hope
and
suspecting
from
what
had
passed
the
inflexibility
of
manfredâ€™s
temper
he
cast
a
glance
towards
the
prince
as
if
to
say
canst
thou
be
unmoved
at
such
a
scene
as
this
manfredâ€™s
heart
was
capable
of
being
touched
he
forgot
his
anger
in
his
astonishment
yet
his
pride
forbad
his
owning
himself
affected
he
even
doubted
whether
this
discovery
was
not
a
contrivance
of
the
friar
to
save
the
youth
â€œwhat
may
this
meanâ€
said
he
â€œhow
can
he
be
thy
son
is
it
consistent
with
thy
profession
or
reputed
sanctity
to
avow
a
peasantâ€™s
offspring
for
the
fruit
of
thy
irregular
amoursâ€
â€œoh

said
the
holy
man
â€œdost

the
attendants
â€œfor

â€œpeaceâ€

manfred
sternly
â€œi
must
know
more

to
pardon

theodore
â€œadd

that
flows
in

â€œyesâ€
said
the
friar
interrupting
him
â€œhis

alas
my

what

we
are

jerome
endeavoured
to
check
the
impetuosity
of
the
youth
and
ere
manfred
could
reply
the
trampling
of
horses
was
heard
and
a
brazen
trumpet
which
hung
without
the
gate
of
the
castle
was
suddenly
sounded
at
the
same
instant
the
sable
plumes
on
the
enchanted
helmet
which
still
remained
at
the
other
end
of
the
court
were
tempestuously
agitated
and
nodded
thrice
as
if
bowed
by
some
invisible
wearer
manfredâ€™s
heart
misgave
him
when
he
beheld
the
plumage
on
the
miraculous
casque
shaken
in
concert
with
the
sounding
of
the
brazen
trumpet
â€œfatherâ€
said
he
to
jerome
whom
he
now
ceased
to
treat
as
count
of

â€œwhat

the
plumes
were
shaken
with
greater
violence
than
before

manfred

jerome

on

jerome
inquiring

the

to

repeat
the
message

words

manfred
with
terror

rage
rekindled
and
all
his
courage
revived
â€œusurperâ€”insolent
villainâ€
cried
he
â€œwho
dares
to
question
my
title
retire
father
this
is
no
business
for
monks
i
will
meet
this
presumptuous
man
myself
go
to
your
convent
and
prepare
the
princessâ€™s
return
your
son
shall
be
a
hostage
for
your
fidelity
his
life
depends
on
your
obedienceâ€
â€œgood
heaven
my
lordâ€
cried
jerome
â€œyour
highness
did
but
this
instant
freely
pardon
my
childâ€”have
you
so
soon
forgot
the
interposition
of
heavenâ€
â€œheavenâ€
replied
manfred
â€œdoes
not
send
heralds
to
question
the
title
of
a
lawful
prince
i
doubt
whether
it
even
notifies
its
will
through
friarsâ€”but
that
is
your
affair
not
mine
at
present
you
know
my
pleasure
and
it
is
not
a
saucy
herald
that
shall
save
your
son
if
you
do
not
return
with
the
princessâ€
it
was
in
vain
for
the
holy
man
to
reply
manfred
commanded
him
to
be
conducted
to
the
postern-gate
and
shut
out
from
the
castle
and
he
ordered
some
of
his
attendants
to
carry
theodore
to
the
top
of
the
black
tower
and
guard
him
strictly
scarce
permitting
the
father
and
son
to
exchange
a
hasty
embrace
at
parting
he
then
withdrew
to
the
hall
and
seating
himself
in
princely
state
ordered
the
herald
to
be
admitted
to
his
presence
â€œwell
thou
insolentâ€
said
the
prince
â€œwhat
wouldst
thou
with
meâ€
â€œi
comeâ€
replied
he
â€œto
thee
manfred
usurper
of
the
principality
of
otranto
from
the
renowned
and
invincible
knight
the
knight
of
the
gigantic
sabre
in
the
name
of
his
lord
frederic
marquis
of
vicenza
he
demands
the
lady
isabella
daughter
of
that
prince
whom
thou
hast
basely
and
traitorously
got
into
thy
power
by
bribing
her
false
guardians
during
his
absence
and
he
requires
thee
to
resign
the
principality
of
otranto
which
thou
hast
usurped
from
the
said
lord
frederic
the
nearest
of
blood
to
the
last
rightful
lord
alfonso
the
good
if
thou
dost
not
instantly
comply
with
these
just
demands
he
defies
thee
to
single
combat
to
the
last
extremityâ€
and
so
saying
the
herald
cast
down
his
warder
â€œand
where
is
this
braggart
who
sends
theeâ€
said
manfred
â€œat
the
distance
of
a
leagueâ€
said
the
herald
â€œhe
comes
to
make
good
his
lordâ€™s
claim
against
thee
as
he
is
a
true
knight
and
thou
an
usurper
and
ravisherâ€
injurious
as
this
challenge
was
manfred
reflected
that
it
was
not
his
interest
to
provoke
the
marquis
he
knew
how
well
founded
the
claim
of
frederic
was
nor
was
this
the
first
time
he
had
heard
of
it
fredericâ€™s
ancestors
had
assumed
the
style
of
princes
of
otranto
from
the
death
of
alfonso
the
good
without
issue
but
manfred
his
father
and
grandfather
had
been
too
powerful
for
the
house
of
vicenza
to
dispossess
them
frederic
a
martial
and
amorous
young
prince
had
married
a
beautiful
young
lady
of
whom
he
was
enamoured
and
who
had
died
in
childbed
of
isabella
her
death
affected
him
so
much
that
he
had
taken
the
cross
and
gone
to
the
holy
land
where
he
was
wounded
in
an
engagement
against
the
infidels
made
prisoner
and
reported
to
be
dead
when
the
news
reached
manfredâ€™s
ears
he
bribed
the
guardians
of
the
lady
isabella
to
deliver
her
up
to
him
as
a
bride
for
his
son
conrad
by
which
alliance
he
had
proposed
to
unite
the
claims
of
the
two
houses
this
motive
on
conradâ€™s
death
had
co-operated
to
make
him
so
suddenly
resolve
on
espousing
her
himself
and
the
same
reflection
determined
him
now
to
endeavour
at
obtaining
the
consent
of
frederic
to
this
marriage
a
like
policy
inspired
him
with
the
thought
of
inviting
fredericâ€™s
champion
into
the
castle
lest
he
should
be
informed
of
isabellaâ€™s
flight
which
he
strictly
enjoined
his
domestics
not
to
disclose
to
any
of
the
knightâ€™s
retinue
â€œheraldâ€
said
manfred
as
soon
as
he
had
digested
these
reflections
â€œreturn
to
thy
master
and
tell
him
ere
we
liquidate
our
differences
by
the
sword
manfred
would
hold
some
converse
with
him
bid
him
welcome
to
my
castle
where
by
my
faith
as
i
am
a
true
knight
he
shall
have
courteous
reception
and
full
security
for
himself
and
followers
if
we
cannot
adjust
our
quarrel
by
amicable
means
i
swear
he
shall
depart
in
safety
and
shall
have
full
satisfaction
according
to
the
laws
of
arms
so
help
me
god
and
his
holy
trinityâ€
the
herald
made
three
obeisances
and
retired
during
this
interview
jeromeâ€™s
mind
was
agitated
by
a
thousand
contrary
passions
he
trembled
for
the
life
of
his
son
and
his
first
thought
was
to
persuade
isabella
to
return
to
the
castle
yet
he
was
scarce
less
alarmed
at
the
thought
of
her
union
with
manfred
he
dreaded
hippolitaâ€™s
unbounded
submission
to
the
will
of
her
lord
and
though
he
did
not
doubt
but
he
could
alarm
her
piety
not
to
consent
to
a
divorce
if
he
could
get
access
to
her
yet
should
manfred
discover
that
the
obstruction
came
from
him
it
might
be
equally
fatal
to
theodore
he
was
impatient
to
know
whence
came
the
herald
who
with
so
little
management
had
questioned
the
title
of
manfred
yet
he
did
not
dare
absent
himself
from
the
convent
lest
isabella
should
leave
it
and
her
flight
be
imputed
to
him
he
returned
disconsolately
to
the
monastery
uncertain
on
what
conduct
to
resolve
a
monk
who
met
him
in
the
porch
and
observed
his
melancholy
air
saidâ€”
â€œalas
brother
is
it
then
true
that
we
have
lost
our
excellent
princess
hippolitaâ€
the
holy
man
started
and
cried
â€œwhat
meanest
thou
brother
i
come
this
instant
from
the
castle
and
left
her
in
perfect
healthâ€
â€œmartelliâ€
replied
the
other
friar
â€œpassed
by
the
convent
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
on
his
way
from
the
castle
and
reported
that
her
highness
was
dead
all
our
brethren
are
gone
to
the
chapel
to
pray
for
her
happy
transit
to
a
better
life
and
willed
me
to
wait
thy
arrival
they
know
thy
holy
attachment
to
that
good
lady
and
are
anxious
for
the
affliction
it
will
cause
in
theeâ€”indeed
we
have
all
reason
to
weep
she
was
a
mother
to
our
house
but
this
life
is
but
a
pilgrimage
we
must
not
murmurâ€”we
shall
all
follow
her
may
our
end
be
like
hersâ€
â€œgood
brother
thou
dreamestâ€
said
jerome
â€œi
tell
thee
i
come
from
the
castle
and
left
the
princess
well
where
is
the
lady
isabellaâ€
â€œpoor
gentlewomanâ€
replied
the
friar
â€œi
told
her
the
sad
news
and
offered
her
spiritual
comfort
i
reminded
her
of
the
transitory
condition
of
mortality
and
advised
her
to
take
the
veil
i
quoted
the
example
of
the
holy
princess
sanchia
of
arragonâ€
â€œthy
zeal
was
laudableâ€
said
jerome
impatiently
â€œbut
at
present
it
was
unnecessary
hippolita
is
wellâ€”at
least
i
trust
in
the
lord
she
is
i
heard
nothing
to
the
contraryâ€”yet
methinks
the
princeâ€™s
earnestnessâ€”well
brother
but
where
is
the
lady
isabellaâ€
â€œi
know
notâ€
said
the
friar
â€œshe
wept
much
and
said
she
would
retire
to
her
chamberâ€
jerome
left
his
comrade
abruptly
and
hastened
to
the
princess
but
she
was
not
in
her
chamber
he
inquired
of
the
domestics
of
the
convent
but
could
learn
no
news
of
her
he
searched
in
vain
throughout
the
monastery
and
the
church
and
despatched
messengers
round
the
neighbourhood
to
get
intelligence
if
she
had
been
seen
but
to
no
purpose
nothing
could
equal
the
good
manâ€™s
perplexity
he
judged
that
isabella
suspecting
manfred
of
having
precipitated
his
wifeâ€™s
death
had
taken
the
alarm
and
withdrawn
herself
to
some
more
secret
place
of
concealment
this
new
flight
would
probably
carry
the
princeâ€™s
fury
to
the
height
the
report
of
hippolitaâ€™s
death
though
it
seemed
almost
incredible
increased
his
consternation
and
though
isabellaâ€™s
escape
bespoke
her
aversion
of
manfred
for
a
husband
jerome
could
feel
no
comfort
from
it
while
it
endangered
the
life
of
his
son
he
determined
to
return
to
the
castle
and
made
several
of
his
brethren
accompany
him
to
attest
his
innocence
to
manfred
and
if
necessary
join
their
intercession
with
his
for
theodore
the
prince
in
the
meantime
had
passed
into
the
court
and
ordered
the
gates
of
the
castle
to
be
flung
open
for
the
reception
of
the
stranger
knight
and
his
train
in
a
few
minutes
the
cavalcade
arrived
first
came
two
harbingers
with
wands
next
a
herald
followed
by
two
pages
and
two
trumpets
then
a
hundred
foot-guards
these
were
attended
by
as
many
horse
after
them
fifty
footmen
clothed
in
scarlet
and
black
the
colours
of
the
knight
then
a
led
horse
two
heralds
on
each
side
of
a
gentleman
on
horseback
bearing
a
banner
with
the
arms
of
vicenza
and
otranto
quarterlyâ€”a
circumstance
that
much
offended
manfredâ€”but
he
stifled
his
resentment
two
more
pages
the
knightâ€™s
confessor
telling
his
beads
fifty
more
footmen
clad
as
before
two
knights
habited
in
complete
armour
their
beavers
down
comrades
to
the
principal
knight
the
squires
of
the
two
knights
carrying
their
shields
and
devices
the
knightâ€™s
own
squire
a
hundred
gentlemen
bearing
an
enormous
sword
and
seeming
to
faint
under
the
weight
of
it
the
knight
himself
on
a
chestnut
steed
in
complete
armour
his
lance
in
the
rest
his
face
entirely
concealed
by
his
vizor
which
was
surmounted
by
a
large
plume
of
scarlet
and
black
feathers
fifty
foot-guards
with
drums
and
trumpets
closed
the
procession
which
wheeled
off
to
the
right
and
left
to
make
room
for
the
principal
knight
as
soon
as
he
approached
the
gate
he
stopped
and
the
herald
advancing
read
again
the
words
of
the
challenge
manfredâ€™s
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
gigantic
sword
and
he
scarce
seemed
to
attend
to
the
cartel
but
his
attention
was
soon
diverted
by
a
tempest
of
wind
that
rose
behind
him
he
turned
and
beheld
the
plumes
of
the
enchanted
helmet
agitated
in
the
same
extraordinary
manner
as
before
it
required
intrepidity
like
manfredâ€™s
not
to
sink
under
a
concurrence
of
circumstances
that
seemed
to
announce
his
fate
yet
scorning
in
the
presence
of
strangers
to
betray
the
courage
he
had
always
manifested
he
said
boldlyâ€”
â€œsir
knight
whoever
thou
art
i
bid
thee
welcome
if
thou
art
of
mortal
mould
thy
valour
shall
meet
its
equal
and
if
thou
art
a
true
knight
thou
wilt
scorn
to
employ
sorcery
to
carry
thy
point
be
these
omens
from
heaven
or
hell
manfred
trusts
to
the
righteousness
of
his
cause
and
to
the
aid
of
st
nicholas
who
has
ever
protected
his
house
alight
sir
knight
and
repose
thyself
to-morrow
thou
shalt
have
a
fair
field
and
heaven
befriend
the
juster
sideâ€
the
knight
made
no
reply
but
dismounting
was
conducted
by
manfred
to
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
as
they
traversed
the
court
the
knight
stopped
to
gaze
on
the
miraculous
casque
and
kneeling
down
seemed
to
pray
inwardly
for
some
minutes
rising
he
made
a
sign
to
the
prince
to
lead
on
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
hall
manfred
proposed
to
the
stranger
to
disarm
but
the
knight
shook
his
head
in
token
of
refusal
â€œsir
knightâ€
said
manfred
â€œthis
is
not
courteous
but
by
my
good
faith
i
will
not
cross
thee
nor
shalt
thou
have
cause
to
complain
of
the
prince
of
otranto
no
treachery
is
designed
on
my
part
i
hope
none
is
intended
on
thine
here
take
my
gageâ€
giving
him
his
ring
â€œyour
friends
and
you
shall
enjoy
the
laws
of
hospitality
rest
here
until
refreshments
are
brought
i
will
but
give
orders
for
the
accommodation
of
your
train
and
return
to
youâ€
the
three
knights
bowed
as
accepting
his
courtesy
manfred
directed
the
strangerâ€™s
retinue
to
be
conducted
to
an
adjacent
hospital
founded
by
the
princess
hippolita
for
the
reception
of
pilgrims
as
they
made
the
circuit
of
the
court
to
return
towards
the
gate
the
gigantic
sword
burst
from
the
supporters
and
falling
to
the
ground
opposite
to
the
helmet
remained
immovable
manfred
almost
hardened
to
preternatural
appearances
surmounted
the
shock
of
this
new
prodigy
and
returning
to
the
hall
where
by
this
time
the
feast
was
ready
he
invited
his
silent
guests
to
take
their
places
manfred
however
ill
his
heart
was
at
ease
endeavoured
to
inspire
the
company
with
mirth
he
put
several
questions
to
them
but
was
answered
only
by
signs
they
raised
their
vizors
but
sufficiently
to
feed
themselves
and
that
sparingly
â€œsirsâ€
said
the
prince
â€œye
are
the
first
guests
i
ever
treated
within
these
walls
who
scorned
to
hold
any
intercourse
with
me
nor
has
it
oft
been
customary
i
ween
for
princes
to
hazard
their
state
and
dignity
against
strangers
and
mutes
you
say
you
come
in
the
name
of
frederic
of
vicenza
i
have
ever
heard
that
he
was
a
gallant
and
courteous
knight
nor
would
he
i
am
bold
to
say
think
it
beneath
him
to
mix
in
social
converse
with
a
prince
that
is
his
equal
and
not
unknown
by
deeds
in

still
ye
are
silentâ€”well
be
it
as
it
mayâ€”by
the
laws
of
hospitality
and
chivalry
ye
are

under
this
roof
ye
shall
do

goblet
of
wine

will
not
refuse
to
pledge
me
to
the
healths
of
your
fair
mistressesâ€
the
principal
knight
sighed
and
crossed
himself
and
was
rising
from
the
board
â€œsir
knightâ€
said
manfred
â€œwhat
i
said
was
but
in
sport

shall
constrain

better
relished
than

manfred
then
conducting
the
three
knights
into
an
inner
chamber
shut
the
door
and
inviting
them
to
be
seated
began
thus
addressing
himself
to
the
chief
personageâ€”
â€œyou

knight
as
i
understand
in

been
contracted
in

in

the
stranger
shook
his
head
â€œsir

said
manfred
warmly
â€œricardo

a
valiant

was
peculiarly
patronised

other

take
his

by

if

they
would
not
stake
their

on

combat
they
would
not
submit
it
to
the

of

mutesâ€”pardon
me
gentlemen
i
am
too
warm
but
suppose
yourselves
in
my

as
ye

stout
knights
would
it
not
move
your
choler
to
have
your

and
the
honour
of

called
in
questionâ€
â€œbut
to
the
point
ye
require
me
to
deliver
up
the

isabella
sirs
i
must
ask

the

nodded
â€œreceive
herâ€
continued
manfred
â€œwell
you
are

may
i
ask

the

nodded
â€œâ€™tis
wellâ€
said
manfred
â€œthen
hear
what
i

to

the
most
unhappy
of

he
began
to
weep
â€œafford
me
your
compassion
i
am
entitled

indeed
i
am

i
have
lost
my
only
hope
my

the

died
yester

the

discovered
signs
of
surprise
â€œyes
sirs
fate
has
disposed
of
my
son
isabella

at

â€œdo
you
then
restore
herâ€
cried
the
chief
knight
breaking
silence
â€œafford
me
your
patienceâ€
said
manfred
â€œi
rejoice
to
find
by
this
testimony
of
your
goodwill
that
this
matter
may
be
adjusted
without
blood
it
is
no

of
mine
dictates
what
little
i
have
farther
to
say
ye
behold
in
me
a
man
disgusted
with
the
world
the
loss
of
my
son
has
weaned
me
from
earthly
cares
power
and
greatness
have
no
longer
any
charms
in
my
eyes
i
wished
to
transmit
the
sceptre
i
had
received
from
my
ancestors
with
honour
to
my
sonâ€”but
that
is
over
life
itself
is
so
indifferent
to
me
that
i
accepted
your
defiance
with
joy
a
good
knight
cannot
go
to
the
grave
with
more
satisfaction
than
when
falling
in
his
vocation
whatever
is
the
will
of
heaven
i
submit
for
alas
sirs
i
am
a
man
of
many
sorrows
manfred
is
no
object
of
envy
but
no
doubt
you
are
acquainted
with
my
storyâ€
the
knight
made
signs
of
ignorance
and
seemed
curious
to
have
manfred
proceed
â€œis
it
possible
sirsâ€
continued
the
prince
â€œthat
my
story
should
be
a
secret
to
you
have
you
heard
nothing
relating
to
me
and
the
princess
hippolitaâ€
they
shook
their
heads
â€œno
thus
then
sirs
it
is
you
think
me
ambitious
ambition
alas
is
composed
of
more
rugged
materials
if
i
were
ambitious
i
should
not
for
so
many
years
have
been
a
prey
to
all
the
hell
of
conscientious
scruples
but
i
weary
your
patience
i
will
be
brief
know
then
that
i
have
long
been
troubled
in
mind
on
my
union
with
the
princess
hippolita
oh
sirs
if
ye
were
acquainted
with
that
excellent
woman
if
ye
knew
that
i
adore
her
like
a
mistress
and
cherish
her
as
a
friendâ€”but
man
was
not
born
for
perfect
happiness
she
shares
my
scruples
and
with
her
consent
i
have
brought
this
matter
before
the
church
for
we
are
related
within
the
forbidden
degrees
i
expect
every
hour
the
definitive
sentence
that
must
separate
us
for
everâ€”i
am
sure
you
feel
for
meâ€”i
see
you
doâ€”pardon
these
tearsâ€
the
knights
gazed
on
each
other
wondering
where
this
would
end
manfred
continuedâ€”
â€œthe
death
of
my
son
betiding
while
my
soul
was
under
this
anxiety
i
thought
of
nothing
but
resigning
my
dominions
and
retiring
for
ever
from
the
sight
of
mankind
my
only
difficulty
was
to
fix
on
a
successor
who
would
be
tender
of
my
people
and
to
dispose
of
the
lady
isabella
who
is
dear
to
me
as
my
own
blood
i
was
willing
to
restore
the
line
of
alfonso
even
in
his
most
distant
kindred
and
though
pardon
me
i
am
satisfied
it
was
his
will
that
ricardoâ€™s
lineage
should
take
place
of
his
own
relations
yet
where
was
i
to
search
for
those
relations
i
knew
of
none
but
frederic
your
lord
he
was
a
captive
to
the
infidels
or
dead
and
were
he
living
and
at
home
would
he
quit
the
flourishing
state
of
vicenza
for
the
inconsiderable
principality
of
otranto
if
he
would
not
could
i
bear
the
thought
of
seeing
a
hard
unfeeling
viceroy
set
over
my
poor
faithful
people
for
sirs
i
love
my
people
and
thank
heaven
am
beloved
by
them
but
ye
will
ask
whither
tends
this
long
discourse
briefly
then
thus
sirs
heaven
in
your
arrival
seems
to
point
out
a
remedy
for
these
difficulties
and
my
misfortunes
the
lady
isabella
is
at
liberty
i
shall
soon
be
so
i
would
submit
to
anything
for
the
good
of
my
people
were
it
not
the
best
the
only
way
to
extinguish
the
feuds
between
our
families
if
i
was
to
take
the
lady
isabella
to
wife
you
start
but
though
hippolitaâ€™s
virtues
will
ever
be
dear
to
me
a
prince
must
not
consider
himself
he
is
born
for
his
peopleâ€
a
servant
at
that
instant
entering
the
chamber
apprised
manfred
that
jerome
and
several
of
his
brethren
demanded
immediate
access
to
him
the
prince
provoked
at
this
interruption
and
fearing
that
the
friar
would
discover
to
the
strangers
that
isabella
had
taken
sanctuary
was
going
to
forbid
jeromeâ€™s
entrance
but
recollecting
that
he
was
certainly
arrived
to
notify
the
princessâ€™s
return
manfred
began
to
excuse
himself
to
the
knights
for
leaving
them
for
a
few
moments
but
was
prevented
by
the
arrival
of
the
friars
manfred
angrily
reprimanded
them
for
their
intrusion
and
would
have
forced
them
back
from
the
chamber
but
jerome
was
too
much
agitated
to
be
repulsed
he
declared
aloud
the
flight
of
isabella
with
protestations
of
his
own
innocence
manfred
distracted
at
the
news
and
not
less
at
its
coming
to
the
knowledge
of
the
strangers
uttered
nothing
but
incoherent
sentences
now
upbraiding
the
friar
now
apologising
to
the
knights
earnest
to
know
what
was
become
of
isabella
yet
equally
afraid
of
their
knowing
impatient
to
pursue
her
yet
dreading
to
have
them
join
in
the
pursuit
he
offered
to
despatch
messengers
in
quest
of
her
but
the
chief
knight
no
longer
keeping
silence
reproached
manfred
in
bitter
terms
for
his
dark
and
ambiguous
dealing
and
demanded
the
cause
of
isabellaâ€™s
first
absence
from
the
castle
manfred
casting
a
stern
look
at
jerome
implying
a
command
of
silence
pretended
that
on
conradâ€™s
death
he
had
placed
her
in
sanctuary
until
he
could
determine
how
to
dispose
of
her
jerome
who
trembled
for
his
sonâ€™s
life
did
not
dare
contradict
this
falsehood
but
one
of
his
brethren
not
under
the
same
anxiety
declared
frankly
that
she
had
fled
to
their
church
in
the
preceding
night
the
prince
in
vain
endeavoured
to
stop
this
discovery
which
overwhelmed
him
with
shame
and
confusion
the
principal
stranger
amazed
at
the
contradictions
he
heard
and
more
than
half
persuaded
that
manfred
had
secreted
the
princess
notwithstanding
the
concern
he
expressed
at
her
flight
rushing
to
the
door
saidâ€”
â€œthou
traitor
prince
isabella
shall
be
foundâ€
manfred
endeavoured
to
hold
him
but
the
other
knights
assisting
their
comrade
he
broke
from
the
prince
and
hastened
into
the
court
demanding
his
attendants
manfred
finding
it
vain
to
divert
him
from
the
pursuit
offered
to
accompany
him
and
summoning
his
attendants
and
taking
jerome
and
some
of
the
friars
to
guide
them
they
issued
from
the
castle
manfred
privately
giving
orders
to
have
the
knightâ€™s
company
secured
while
to
the
knight
he
affected
to
despatch
a
messenger
to
require
their
assistance
the
company
had
no
sooner
quitted
the
castle
than
matilda
who
felt
herself
deeply
interested
for
the
young
peasant
since
she
had
seen
him
condemned
to
death
in
the
hall
and
whose
thoughts
had
been
taken
up
with
concerting
measures
to
save
him
was
informed
by
some
of
the
female
attendants
that
manfred
had
despatched
all
his
men
various
ways
in
pursuit
of
isabella
he
had
in
his
hurry
given
this
order
in
general
terms
not
meaning
to
extend
it
to
the
guard
he
had
set
upon
theodore
but
forgetting
it
the
domestics
officious
to
obey
so
peremptory
a
prince
and
urged
by
their
own
curiosity
and
love
of
novelty
to
join
in
any
precipitate
chase
had
to
a
man
left
the
castle
matilda
disengaged
herself
from
her
women
stole
up
to
the
black
tower
and
unbolting
the
door
presented
herself
to
the
astonished
theodore
â€œyoung
manâ€
said
she
â€œthough
filial
duty
and
womanly
modesty
condemn
the
step
i
am
taking
yet
holy
charity
surmounting
all
other
ties

act
fly
the
doors
of
thy
prison
are
open

father
and
his
domestics
are
absent
but
they
may
soon
return
be
gone
in
safety
and
may
the
angels
of
heaven
direct
thy
courseâ€
â€œthou
art
surely
one
of
those
angelsâ€
said
the
enraptured
theodore
â€œnone
but
a
blessed
saint

speak

actâ€”could
lookâ€”like
thee

i
not

thou

it
possible

thou
answerest
not

how
art
thou
here

why
dost
thou
neglect
thy

safety
and
waste
a
thought
on
a
wretch
like
theodore

us
fly
together
the
life
thou
bestowest
shall
be
dedicated
to
thy
defenceâ€
â€œalas
thou
mistakestâ€
said
matilda
signing
â€œi
am
manfredâ€™s
daughter
but
no
dangers
await
meâ€
â€œamazementâ€
said
theodore
â€œbut
last
night
i
blessed
myself
for
yielding
thee
the
service
thy
gracious
compassion
so
charitably
returns
me
nowâ€
â€œstill
thou
art
in
an
errorâ€
said
the
princess
â€œbut
this
is
no
time
for
explanation

youth
while
it
is
in
my
power
to
save
thee

and
i
both
should
indeed

â€œhowâ€
said
theodore
â€œthinkest
thou
charming
maid
that
i

accept

of
aught
calamitous
to
thee

endured
a
thousand
deathsâ€
â€œi
run
no

said
matilda
â€œbut
by
thy
delay

it
cannot
be
known
that
i
have
assisted
thy
flightâ€
â€œswear
by
the

said
theodore
â€œthat
thou
canst
not

i
vow
to
await
whatever
can
befall
meâ€
â€œoh
thou
art
too
generousâ€
said
matilda
â€œbut
rest
assured
that
no

alight
on
meâ€
â€œgive
me
thy
beauteous
hand
in
token
that

said
theodore
â€œand
let
me
bathe
it
with
the
warm
tears
of
gratitudeâ€
â€œforbearâ€
said
the
princess
â€œthis
must
not
beâ€
â€œalasâ€
said
theodore
â€œi
have
never
known
but
calamity
until
this
hourâ€”perhaps
shall
never
know
other
fortune
again
suffer
the
chaste
raptures
of
holy
gratitude
â€™tis
my
soul
would
print
its
effusions
on

â€œforbear

be
goneâ€
said
matilda
â€œhow
would
isabella
approve
of
seeing
thee
at
my
feetâ€
â€œwho
is
isabellaâ€
said
the
young
man
with
surprise
â€œah
me
i
fearâ€
said
the
princess
â€œi
am
serving
a
deceitful
one
hast
thou
forgot
thy
curiosity
this
morningâ€
â€œthy
looks
thy
actions
all
thy
beauteous
self

said
theodore
â€œbut
thy

are
dark
and
mysterious

speak
to
thy
servantâ€™s
comprehensionâ€
â€œthou
understandest
but
too
wellâ€
said
matilda
â€œbut
once
more
i
command
thee

be
on

i
waste
the
time
in

discourseâ€
â€œi
go

said
theodore
â€œbecause

matilda
â€œi
will
conduct
thee

thee
to
the

nicholas
where
thou
mayst
take

â€œwhatâ€
said
theodore
â€œwas
it
another
and
not
thy

i
assisted
to
find
the
subterraneous

â€œit

matilda
â€œbut
ask
no

â€œto
sanctuaryâ€
said
theodore
â€œno

free

me
a

and
thy

shall
learn
that
theodore
scorns
an
ignominious
flightâ€
â€œrash

said
matilda
â€œthou

thy
presumptuous
arm

â€œnot

i

notâ€
said
theodore
â€œexcuse
me

i
had
forgotten
but
could
i
gaze
on
thee
and
remember
thou
art
sprung
from
the
tyrant
manfred
but
he
is
thy
father
and
from
this
moment
my
injuries
are
buried
in
oblivionâ€
a
deep
and
hollow
groan
which
seemed
to
come
from
above
startled
the
princess
and
theodore
â€œgood
heaven
we
are
overheardâ€
said
the
princess
they
listened
but
perceiving
no
further
noise
they
both
concluded
it
the
effect
of
pent-up
vapours
and
the
princess
preceding
theodore
softly
carried
him
to
her
fatherâ€™s
armoury
where
equipping
him
with
a
complete
suit
he
was
conducted
by
matilda
to
the
postern-gate
â€œavoid
the
townâ€
said
the
princess
â€œand
all
the
western
side
of
the
castle
â€™tis
there
the
search
must
be
making
by
manfred
and
the
strangers
but
hie
thee
to
the
opposite
quarter
yonder
behind
that
forest
to
the
east
is
a
chain
of
rocks
hollowed
into
a
labyrinth
of
caverns
that
reach
to
the
sea
coast
there
thou
mayst
lie
concealed
till
thou
canst
make
signs
to
some
vessel
to
put
on
shore
and
take
thee
off
go
heaven
be
thy
guideâ€”and
sometimes
in
thy
prayers
rememberâ€”matildaâ€
theodore
flung
himself
at
her
feet
and
seizing
her
lily
hand
which
with
struggles
she
suffered
him
to
kiss
he
vowed
on
the
earliest
opportunity
to
get
himself
knighted
and
fervently
entreated
her
permission
to
swear
himself
eternally
her
knight
ere
the
princess
could
reply
a
clap
of
thunder
was
suddenly
heard
that
shook
the
battlements
theodore
regardless
of
the
tempest
would
have
urged
his
suit
but
the
princess
dismayed
retreated
hastily
into
the
castle
and
commanded
the
youth
to
be
gone
with
an
air
that
would
not
be
disobeyed
he
sighed
and
retired
but
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
gate
until
matilda
closing
it
put
an
end
to
an
interview
in
which
the
hearts
of
both
had
drunk
so
deeply
of
a
passion
which
both
now
tasted
for
the
first
time
theodore
went
pensively
to
the
convent
to
acquaint
his
father
with
his
deliverance
there
he
learned
the
absence
of
jerome
and
the
pursuit
that
was
making
after
the
lady
isabella
with
some
particulars
of
whose
story
he
now
first
became
acquainted
the
generous
gallantry
of
his
nature
prompted
him
to
wish
to
assist
her
but
the
monks
could
lend
him
no
lights
to
guess
at
the
route
she
had
taken
he
was
not
tempted
to
wander
far
in
search
of
her
for
the
idea
of
matilda
had
imprinted
itself
so
strongly
on
his
heart
that
he
could
not
bear
to
absent
himself
at
much
distance
from
her
abode
the
tenderness
jerome
had
expressed
for
him
concurred
to
confirm
this
reluctance
and
he
even
persuaded
himself
that
filial
affection
was
the
chief
cause
of
his
hovering
between
the
castle
and
monastery
until
jerome
should
return
at
night
theodore
at
length
determined
to
repair
to
the
forest
that
matilda
had
pointed
out
to
him
arriving
there
he
sought
the
gloomiest
shades
as
best
suited
to
the
pleasing
melancholy
that
reigned
in
his
mind
in
this
mood
he
roved
insensibly
to
the
caves
which
had
formerly
served
as
a
retreat
to
hermits
and
were
now
reported
round
the
country
to
be
haunted
by
evil
spirits
he
recollected
to
have
heard
this
tradition
and
being
of
a
brave
and
adventurous
disposition
he
willingly
indulged
his
curiosity
in
exploring
the
secret
recesses
of
this
labyrinth
he
had
not
penetrated
far
before
he
thought
he
heard
the
steps
of
some
person
who
seemed
to
retreat
before
him
theodore
though
firmly
grounded
in
all
our
holy
faith
enjoins
to
be
believed
had
no
apprehension
that
good
men
were
abandoned
without
cause
to
the
malice
of
the
powers
of
darkness
he
thought
the
place
more
likely
to
be
infested
by
robbers
than
by
those
infernal
agents
who
are
reported
to
molest
and
bewilder
travellers
he
had
long
burned
with
impatience
to
approve
his
valour
drawing
his
sabre
he
marched
sedately
onwards
still
directing
his
steps
as
the
imperfect
rustling
sound
before
him
led
the
way
the
armour
he
wore
was
a
like
indication
to
the
person
who
avoided
him
theodore
now
convinced
that
he
was
not
mistaken
redoubled
his
pace
and
evidently
gained
on
the
person
that
fled
whose
haste
increasing
theodore
came
up
just
as
a
woman
fell
breathless
before
him
he
hasted
to
raise
her
but
her
terror
was
so
great
that
he
apprehended
she
would
faint
in
his
arms
he
used
every
gentle
word
to
dispel
her
alarms
and
assured
her
that
far
from
injuring
he
would
defend
her
at
the
peril
of
his
life
the
lady
recovering
her
spirits
from
his
courteous
demeanour
and
gazing
on
her
protector
saidâ€”
â€œsure
i
have
heard
that
voice
beforeâ€
â€œnot
to
my
knowledgeâ€
replied
theodore
â€œunless
as
i
conjecture
thou
art
the
lady
isabellaâ€
â€œmerciful
heavenâ€
cried
she
â€œthou
art
not
sent
in
quest
of
me
art
thouâ€
and
saying
those
words
she
threw
herself
at
his
feet
and
besought
him
not
to
deliver
her
up
to
manfred
â€œto
manfredâ€
cried
theodoreâ€”â€œno
lady
i
have
once
already
delivered
thee
from
his
tyranny
and
it
shall
fare
hard
with
me
now
but
i
will
place
thee
out
of
the
reach
of
his
daringâ€
â€œis
it
possibleâ€
said
she
â€œthat
thou
shouldst
be
the
generous
unknown
whom
i
met
last
night
in
the
vault
of
the
castle
sure
thou
art
not
a
mortal
but
my
guardian
angel
on
my
knees
let
me
thankâ€”â€
â€œhold
gentle
princessâ€
said
theodore
â€œnor
demean
thyself
before
a
poor
and
friendless
young
man
if
heaven
has
selected
me
for
thy
deliverer
it
will
accomplish
its
work
and
strengthen
my
arm
in
thy
cause
but
come
lady
we
are
too
near
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
let
us
seek
its
inmost
recesses
i
can
have
no
tranquillity
till
i
have
placed
thee
beyond
the
reach
of
dangerâ€
â€œalas
what
mean
you
sirâ€
said
she
â€œthough
all
your
actions
are
noble
though
your
sentiments
speak
the
purity
of
your
soul
is
it
fitting
that
i
should
accompany
you
alone
into
these
perplexed
retreats
should
we
be
found
together
what
would
a
censorious
world
think
of
my
conductâ€
â€œi
respect
your
virtuous
delicacyâ€
said
theodore
â€œnor
do
you
harbour
a
suspicion
that
wounds
my
honour
i
meant
to
conduct
you
into
the
most
private
cavity
of
these
rocks
and
then
at
the
hazard
of
my
life
to
guard
their
entrance
against
every
living
thing
besides
ladyâ€
continued
he
drawing
a
deep
sigh
â€œbeauteous
and
all
perfect
as
your
form
is
and
though
my
wishes
are
not
guiltless
of
aspiring
know
my
soul
is
dedicated
to
another
and
althoughâ€”â€
a
sudden
noise
prevented
theodore
from
proceeding
they
soon
distinguished
these
soundsâ€”
â€œisabella
what
ho
isabellaâ€
the
trembling
princess
relapsed
into
her
former
agony
of
fear
theodore
endeavoured
to
encourage
her
but
in
vain
he
assured
her
he
would
die
rather
than
suffer
her
to
return
under
manfredâ€™s
power
and
begging
her
to
remain
concealed
he
went
forth
to
prevent
the
person
in
search
of
her
from
approaching
at
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
he
found
an
armed
knight
discoursing
with
a
peasant
who
assured
him
he
had
seen
a
lady
enter
the
passes
of
the
rock
the
knight
was
preparing
to
seek
her
when
theodore
placing
himself
in
his
way
with
his
sword
drawn
sternly
forbad
him
at
his
peril
to
advance
â€œand
who
art
thou
who
darest
to
cross
my
wayâ€
said
the
knight
haughtily
â€œone
who
does
not
dare
more
than
he
will
performâ€
said
theodore
â€œi
seek
the
lady
isabellaâ€
said
the
knight
â€œand
understand
she
has
taken
refuge
among
these
rocks
impede
me
not
or
thou
wilt
repent
having
provoked
my
resentmentâ€
â€œthy
purpose
is
as
odious
as
thy
resentment
is
contemptibleâ€
said
theodore
â€œreturn
whence
thou
camest
or
we
shall
soon
know
whose
resentment
is
most
terribleâ€
the
stranger
who
was
the
principal
knight
that
had
arrived
from
the
marquis
of
vicenza
had
galloped
from
manfred
as
he
was
busied
in
getting
information
of
the
princess
and
giving
various
orders
to
prevent
her
falling
into
the
power
of
the
three
knights
their
chief
had
suspected
manfred
of
being
privy
to
the
princessâ€™s
absconding
and
this
insult
from
a
man
who
he
concluded
was
stationed
by
that
prince
to
secrete
her
confirming
his
suspicions
he
made
no
reply
but
discharging
a
blow
with
his
sabre
at
theodore
would
soon
have
removed
all
obstruction
if
theodore
who
took
him
for
one
of
manfredâ€™s
captains
and
who
had
no
sooner
given
the
provocation
than
prepared
to
support
it
had
not
received
the
stroke
on
his
shield
the
valour
that
had
so
long
been
smothered
in
his
breast
broke
forth
at
once
he
rushed
impetuously
on
the
knight
whose
pride
and
wrath
were
not
less
powerful
incentives
to
hardy
deeds
the
combat
was
furious
but
not
long
theodore
wounded
the
knight
in
three
several
places
and
at
last
disarmed
him
as
he
fainted
by
the
loss
of
blood
the
peasant
who
had
fled
on
the
first
onset
had
given
the
alarm
to
some
of
manfredâ€™s
domestics
who
by
his
orders
were
dispersed
through
the
forest
in
pursuit
of
isabella
they
came
up
as
the
knight
fell
whom
they
soon
discovered
to
be
the
noble
stranger
theodore
notwithstanding
his
hatred
to
manfred
could
not
behold
the
victory
he
had
gained
without
emotions
of
pity
and
generosity
but
he
was
more
touched
when
he
learned
the
quality
of
his
adversary
and
was
informed
that
he
was
no
retainer
but
an
enemy
of
manfred
he
assisted
the
servants
of
the
latter
in
disarming
the
knight
and
in
endeavouring
to
stanch
the
blood
that
flowed
from
his
wounds
the
knight
recovering
his
speech
said
in
a
faint
and
faltering
voiceâ€”
â€œgenerous
foe
we
have
both
been
in
an
error
i
took
thee
for
an
instrument
of
the
tyrant
i
perceive
thou
hast
made
the
like
mistake
it
is
too
late
for
excuses
i
faint
if
isabella
is
at
handâ€”call
herâ€”i
have
important
secrets
toâ€”â€
â€œhe
is
dyingâ€
said
one
of
the
attendants
â€œhas
nobody
a
crucifix
about
them
andrea
do
thou
pray
over
himâ€
â€œfetch
some
waterâ€
said
theodore
â€œand
pour
it
down
his
throat
while
i
hasten
to
the
princessâ€
saying
this
he
flew
to
isabella
and
in
few
words
told
her
modestly
that
he
had
been
so
unfortunate
by
mistake
as
to
wound
a
gentleman
from
her
fatherâ€™s
court
who
wished
ere
he
died
to
impart
something
of
consequence
to
her
the
princess
who
had
been
transported
at
hearing
the
voice
of
theodore
as
he
called
to
her
to
come
forth
was
astonished
at
what
she
heard
suffering
herself
to
be
conducted
by
theodore
the
new
proof
of
whose
valour
recalled
her
dispersed
spirits
she
came
where
the
bleeding
knight
lay
speechless
on
the
ground
but
her
fears
returned
when
she
beheld
the
domestics
of
manfred
she
would
again
have
fled
if
theodore
had
not
made
her
observe
that
they
were
unarmed
and
had
not
threatened
them
with
instant
death
if
they
should
dare
to
seize
the
princess
the
stranger
opening
his
eyes
and
beholding
a
woman
said
â€œart
thouâ€”pray
tell
me
trulyâ€”art
thou
isabella
of
vicenzaâ€
â€œi
amâ€
said
she
â€œgood
heaven
restore
theeâ€
â€œthen
thouâ€”then
thouâ€â€”said
the
knight
struggling
for
utteranceâ€”â€œseestâ€”thy
father
give
me
oneâ€”â€
â€œoh
amazement
horror
what
do
i
hear
what
do
i
seeâ€
cried
isabella
â€œmy
father
you
my
father
how
came
you
here
sir
for
heavenâ€™s
sake
speak
oh
run
for
help
or
he
will
expireâ€
â€œâ€™tis
most
trueâ€
said
the
wounded
knight
exerting
all
his
force
â€œi
am
frederic
thy
father
yes
i
came
to
deliver
thee
it
will
not
be
give
me
a
parting
kiss
and
takeâ€”â€
â€œsirâ€
said
theodore
â€œdo
not
exhaust
yourself
suffer
us
to
convey
you
to
the
castleâ€
â€œto
the
castleâ€
said
isabella
â€œis
there
no
help
nearer
than
the
castle
would
you
expose
my
father
to
the
tyrant
if
he
goes
thither
i
dare
not
accompany
him
and
yet
can
i
leave
himâ€
â€œmy
childâ€
said
frederic
â€œit
matters
not
for
me
whither
i
am
carried
a
few
minutes
will
place
me
beyond
danger
but
while
i
have
eyes
to
dote
on
thee
forsake
me
not
dear
isabella
this
brave
knightâ€”i
know
not
who
he
isâ€”will
protect
thy
innocence
sir
you
will
not
abandon
my
child
will
youâ€
theodore
shedding
tears
over
his
victim
and
vowing
to
guard
the
princess
at
the
expense
of
his
life
persuaded
frederic
to
suffer
himself
to
be
conducted
to
the
castle
they
placed
him
on
a
horse
belonging
to
one
of
the
domestics
after
binding
up
his
wounds
as
well
as
they
were
able
theodore
marched
by
his
side
and
the
afflicted
isabella
who
could
not
bear
to
quit
him
followed
mournfully
behind
the
sorrowful
troop
no
sooner
arrived
at
the
castle
than
they
were
met
by
hippolita
and
matilda
whom
isabella
had
sent
one
of
the
domestics
before
to
advertise
of
their
approach
the
ladies
causing
frederic
to
be
conveyed
into
the
nearest
chamber
retired
while
the
surgeons
examined
his
wounds
matilda
blushed
at
seeing
theodore
and
isabella
together
but
endeavoured
to
conceal
it
by
embracing
the
latter
and
condoling
with
her
on
her
fatherâ€™s
mischance
the
surgeons
soon
came
to
acquaint
hippolita
that
none
of
the
marquisâ€™s
wounds
were
dangerous
and
that
he
was
desirous
of
seeing
his
daughter
and
the
princesses
theodore
under
pretence
of
expressing
his
joy
at
being
freed
from
his
apprehensions
of
the
combat
being
fatal
to
frederic
could
not
resist
the
impulse
of
following
matilda
her
eyes
were
so
often
cast
down
on
meeting
his
that
isabella
who
regarded
theodore
as
attentively
as
he
gazed
on
matilda
soon
divined
who
the
object
was
that
he
had
told
her
in
the
cave
engaged
his
affections
while
this
mute
scene
passed
hippolita
demanded
of
frederic
the
cause
of
his
having
taken
that
mysterious
course
for
reclaiming
his
daughter
and
threw
in
various
apologies
to
excuse
her
lord
for
the
match
contracted
between
their
children
frederic
however
incensed
against
manfred
was
not
insensible
to
the
courtesy
and
benevolence
of
hippolita
but
he
was
still
more
struck
with
the
lovely
form
of
matilda
wishing
to
detain
them
by
his
bedside
he
informed
hippolita
of
his
story
he
told
her
that
while
prisoner
to
the
infidels
he
had
dreamed
that
his
daughter
of
whom
he
had
learned
no
news
since
his
captivity
was
detained
in
a
castle
where
she
was
in
danger
of
the
most
dreadful
misfortunes
and
that
if
he
obtained
his
liberty
and
repaired
to
a
wood
near
joppa
he
would
learn
more
alarmed
at
this
dream
and
incapable
of
obeying
the
direction
given
by
it
his
chains
became
more
grievous
than
ever
but
while
his
thoughts
were
occupied
on
the
means
of
obtaining
his
liberty
he
received
the
agreeable
news
that
the
confederate
princes
who
were
warring
in
palestine
had
paid
his
ransom
he
instantly
set
out
for
the
wood
that
had
been
marked
in
his
dream
for
three
days
he
and
his
attendants
had
wandered
in
the
forest
without
seeing
a
human
form
but
on
the
evening
of
the
third
they
came
to
a
cell
in
which
they
found
a
venerable
hermit
in
the
agonies
of
death
applying
rich
cordials
they
brought
the
fainting
man
to
his
speech
â€œmy
sonsâ€
said
he
â€œi
am
bounden
to
your
charityâ€”but
it
is
in
vainâ€”i
am
going
to
my
eternal
restâ€”yet
i
die
with
the
satisfaction
of
performing
the
will
of
heaven
when
first
i
repaired
to
this
solitude
after
seeing
my
country
become
a
prey
to
unbelieversâ€”it
is
alas
above
fifty
years
since
i
was
witness
to
that
dreadful
scene
st
nicholas
appeared
to
me
and
revealed
a
secret
which
he
bade
me
never
disclose
to
mortal
man
but
on
my
death-bed
this
is
that
tremendous
hour
and
ye
are
no
doubt
the
chosen
warriors
to
whom
i
was
ordered
to
reveal
my
trust
as
soon
as
ye
have
done
the
last
offices
to
this
wretched
corse
dig
under
the
seventh
tree
on
the
left
hand
of
this
poor
cave
and
your
pains
willâ€”oh
good
heaven
receive
my
soulâ€
with
those
words
the
devout
man
breathed
his
last
â€œby
break
of
dayâ€
continued
frederic
â€œwhen
we
had
committed
the
holy
relics
to
earth
we
dug
according
to
direction
but
what
was
our
astonishment
when
about
the
depth
of
six
feet
we
discovered
an
enormous
sabreâ€”the
very
weapon
yonder
in
the
court
on
the
blade
which
was
then
partly
out
of
the
scabbard
though
since
closed
by
our
efforts
in
removing
it
were
written
the
following
linesâ€”no
excuse
me
madamâ€
added
the
marquis
turning
to
hippolita
â€œif
i
forbear
to
repeat
them
i
respect
your
sex
and
rank
and
would
not
be
guilty
of
offending
your
ear
with
sounds
injurious
to
aught
that
is
dear
to
youâ€
he
paused
hippolita
trembled
she
did
not
doubt
but
frederic
was
destined
by
heaven
to
accomplish
the
fate
that
seemed
to
threaten
her
house
looking
with
anxious
fondness
at
matilda
a
silent
tear
stole
down
her
cheek
but
recollecting
herself
she
saidâ€”
â€œproceed
my
lord
heaven
does
nothing
in
vain
mortals
must
receive
its
divine
behests
with
lowliness
and
submission
it
is
our
part
to
deprecate
its
wrath
or
bow
to
its
decrees
repeat
the
sentence
my
lord
we
listen
resignedâ€
frederic
was
grieved
that
he
had
proceeded
so
far
the
dignity
and
patient
firmness
of
hippolita
penetrated
him
with
respect
and
the
tender
silent
affection
with
which
the
princess
and
her
daughter
regarded
each
other
melted
him
almost
to
tears
yet
apprehensive
that
his
forbearance
to
obey
would
be
more
alarming
he
repeated
in
a
faltering
and
low
voice
the
following
lines
â€œwhereâ€™er
a
casque

restless
princeâ€™s
shadeâ€
â€œwhat
is
there
in
these
linesâ€
said
theodore
impatiently
â€œthat
affects
these
princesses
why
were
they
to
be
shocked
by
a
mysterious
delicacy
that
has
so
little
foundationâ€
â€œyour
words
are
rude
young
manâ€
said
the
marquis
â€œand
though
fortune
has
favoured
you
onceâ€”â€
â€œmy
honoured
lordâ€
said
isabella
who
resented
theodoreâ€™s
warmth
which
she
perceived
was
dictated
by
his
sentiments
for
matilda
â€œdiscompose
not
yourself
for
the
glosing
of
a
peasantâ€™s
son
he
forgets
the
reverence
he
owes
you
but
he
is
not
accustomedâ€”â€
hippolita
concerned
at
the
heat
that
had
arisen
checked
theodore
for
his
boldness
but
with
an
air
acknowledging
his
zeal
and
changing
the
conversation
demanded
of
frederic
where
he
had
left
her
lord
as
the
marquis
was
going
to
reply
they
heard
a
noise
without
and
rising
to
inquire
the
cause
manfred
jerome
and
part
of
the
troop
who
had
met
an
imperfect
rumour
of
what
had
happened
entered
the
chamber
manfred
advanced
hastily
towards
fredericâ€™s
bed
to
condole
with
him
on
his
misfortune
and
to
learn
the
circumstances
of
the
combat
when
starting
in
an
agony
of
terror
and
amazement
he
criedâ€”
â€œha
what
art
thou
thou
dreadful
spectre
is
my
hour
comeâ€
â€œmy
dearest
gracious
lordâ€
cried
hippolita
clasping
him
in
her
arms
â€œwhat
is
it
you
see
why
do
you
fix
your
eye-balls
thusâ€
â€œwhatâ€
cried
manfred
breathless
â€œdost
thou
see
nothing
hippolita
is
this
ghastly
phantom
sent
to
me
aloneâ€”to
rue
who
did
notâ€”â€
â€œfor
mercyâ€™s
sweetest
self
my
lordâ€
said
hippolita
â€œresume
your

your
reason
there
is
none
here

us
your
friendsâ€
â€œwhat
is
not
that
alfonsoâ€
cried
manfred
â€œdost
thou
not

him
can
it
be
my
brainâ€™s
deliriumâ€
â€œthis
my
lordâ€
said
hippolita
â€œthis
is
theodore
the
youth
who
has
been
so
unfortunateâ€
â€œtheodoreâ€
said
manfred
mournfully
and
striking
his
forehead
â€œtheodore
or
a
phantom
he
has
unhinged
the
soul
of
manfred
but
how
comes
he
here
and
how
comes
he
in
armourâ€
â€œi
believe
he
went
in
search
of
isabellaâ€
said
hippolita
â€œof
isabellaâ€
said
manfred
relapsing
into
rage
â€œyes
yes
that
is
not
doubtfulâ€”
but
how
did
he
escape
from
durance
in
which
i
left
him
was
it
isabella
or
this
hypocritical
old
friar
that
procured
his
enlargementâ€
â€œand
would
a
parent
be
criminal
my
lordâ€
said
theodore
â€œif
he
meditated
the
deliverance
of
his
childâ€
jerome
amazed
to
hear
himself
in
a
manner
accused
by
his
son
and
without
foundation
knew
not
what
to
think
he
could
not
comprehend
how
theodore
had
escaped
how
he
came
to
be
armed
and
to
encounter
frederic
still
he
would
not
venture
to
ask
any
questions
that
might
tend
to
inflame
manfredâ€™s
wrath
against
his
son
jeromeâ€™s
silence
convinced
manfred
that
he
had
contrived
theodoreâ€™s
release
â€œand
is
it
thus
thou
ungrateful
old
manâ€
said
the
prince
addressing
himself
to
the
friar
â€œthat
thou
repayest
mine
and
hippolitaâ€™s
bounties
and
not
content
with
traversing
my
heartâ€™s
nearest
wishes
thou
armest
thy
bastard
and
bringest
him
into
my
own
castle
to
insult
meâ€
â€œmy
lordâ€
said
theodore
â€œyou
wrong
my
father
neither
he
nor
i
are
capable
of
harbouring
a
thought
against
your
peace
is
it
insolence
thus
to
surrender
myself
to
your

pleasureâ€
added
he
laying
his
sword
respectfully
at
manfredâ€™s
feet
â€œbehold

you
suspect
that
a

there
there
is
not

engraven
on
my
heart
that
does
not
venerate
you
and
yoursâ€
the
grace
and
fervour
with
which
theodore
uttered
these
words
interested
every
person
present
in
his
favour
even
manfred
was
touchedâ€”yet
still
possessed
with
his
resemblance
to
alfonso
his
admiration
was
dashed
with
secret
horror
â€œriseâ€
said
he
â€œthy
life
is
not
my
present

tell
me
thy
history

how
thou
camest

â€œmy

said
jerome
eagerly
â€œpeace

said
manfred
â€œi
will
not
have
him
promptedâ€
â€œmy
lordâ€
said
theodore
â€œi
want
no
assistance
my
story
is
very
brief
i
was
carried
at
five
years
of
age
to
algiers
with
my
mother
who
had
been
taken
by
corsairs
from
the
coast
of
sicily
she
died
of
grief
in
less
than
a
twelvemonthâ€
the
tears
gushed
from
jeromeâ€™s
eyes
on
whose
countenance
a
thousand
anxious
passions
stood
expressed
â€œbefore
she
diedâ€
continued
theodore
â€œshe
bound
a
writing
about
my
arm
under
my
garments
which
told
me
i
was
the
son
of
the
count
falconaraâ€
â€œit
is
most
trueâ€
said
jerome
â€œi
am
that
wretched
fatherâ€
â€œagain
i
enjoin
thee
silenceâ€
said
manfred
â€œproceedâ€
â€œi
remained
in
slaveryâ€
said
theodore
â€œuntil
within
these
two
years
when
attending
on
my
master
in
his
cruises
i
was
delivered
by
a
christian
vessel
which
overpowered
the
pirate
and
discovering
myself
to
the
captain
he
generously
put
me
on
shore
in
sicily
but
alas
instead
of
finding
a
father
i
learned
that
his
estate
which
was
situated
on
the
coast
had
during
his
absence
been
laid
waste
by
the
rover
who
had
carried
my
mother
and
me
into
captivity
that
his
castle
had
been
burnt
to
the
ground
and
that
my
father
on
his
return
had
sold
what
remained
and
was
retired
into
religion
in
the
kingdom
of
naples
but
where
no
man
could
inform
me
destitute
and
friendless
hopeless
almost
of
attaining
the
transport
of
a
parentâ€™s
embrace
i
took
the
first
opportunity
of
setting
sail
for
naples
from
whence
within
these
six
days
i
wandered
into
this
province
still
supporting
myself
by
the
labour
of
my
hands
nor
until
yester-morn
did
i
believe
that
heaven
had
reserved
any
lot
for
me
but
peace
of
mind
and
contented
poverty
this
my
lord
is
theodoreâ€™s
story
i
am
blessed
beyond
my
hope
in
finding
a
father
i
am
unfortunate
beyond
my
desert
in
having
incurred
your
highnessâ€™s
displeasureâ€
he
ceased
a
murmur
of
approbation
gently
arose
from
the
audience
â€œthis
is
not
allâ€
said
frederic
â€œi
am
bound
in
honour
to
add
what
he
suppresses
though
he
is
modest
i
must
be
generous
he
is
one
of
the
bravest
youths
on
christian
ground
he
is
warm
too
and
from
the
short
knowledge
i
have
of
him
i
will
pledge
myself
for
his
veracity
if
what
he
reports
of
himself
were
not
true
he
would
not
utter
itâ€”and
for
me
youth
i
honour
a
frankness
which
becomes
thy
birth
but
now
and
thou
didst
offend
me
yet
the
noble
blood
which
flows
in
thy
veins
may
well
be
allowed
to
boil
out
when
it
has
so
recently
traced
itself
to
its
source
come
my
lordâ€
turning
to
manfred
â€œif
i
can
pardon
him
surely
you
may
it
is
not
the
youthâ€™s
fault
if
you
took
him
for
a
spectreâ€
this
bitter
taunt
galled
the
soul
of
manfred
â€œif
beings
from
another
worldâ€
replied
he
haughtily
â€œhave
power
to
impress
my
mind
with
awe
it
is
more
than
living
man
can
do
nor
could
a
striplingâ€™s
armâ€
â€œmy
lordâ€
interrupted
hippolita
â€œyour
guest
has
occasion
for
repose
shall
we
not
leave
him
to
his
restâ€
saying
this
and
taking
manfred
by
the
hand
she
took
leave
of
frederic
and
led
the
company
forth
the
prince
not
sorry
to
quit
a
conversation
which
recalled
to
mind
the
discovery
he
had
made
of
his
most
secret
sensations
suffered
himself
to
be
conducted
to
his
own
apartment
after
permitting
theodore
though
under
engagement
to
return
to
the
castle
on
the
morrow
a
condition
the
young
man
gladly
accepted
to
retire
with
his
father
to
the
convent
matilda
and
isabella
were
too
much
occupied
with
their
own
reflections
and
too
little
content
with
each
other
to
wish
for
farther
converse
that
night
they
separated
each
to
her
chamber
with
more
expressions
of
ceremony
and
fewer
of
affection
than
had
passed
between
them
since
their
childhood
if
they
parted
with
small
cordiality
they
did
but
meet
with
greater
impatience
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
risen
their
minds
were
in
a
situation
that
excluded
sleep
and
each
recollected
a
thousand
questions
which
she
wished
she
had
put
to
the
other
overnight
matilda
reflected
that
isabella
had
been
twice
delivered
by
theodore
in
very
critical
situations
which
she
could
not
believe
accidental
his
eyes
it
was
true
had
been
fixed
on
her
in
fredericâ€™s
chamber
but
that
might
have
been
to
disguise
his
passion
for
isabella
from
the
fathers
of
both
it
were
better
to
clear
this
up
she
wished
to
know
the
truth
lest
she
should
wrong
her
friend
by
entertaining
a
passion
for
isabellaâ€™s
lover
thus
jealousy
prompted
and
at
the
same
time
borrowed
an
excuse
from
friendship
to
justify
its
curiosity
isabella
not
less
restless
had
better
foundation
for
her
suspicions
both
theodoreâ€™s
tongue
and
eyes
had
told
her
his
heart
was
engaged
it
was
trueâ€”yet
perhaps
matilda
might
not
correspond
to
his
passion
she
had
ever
appeared
insensible
to
love
all
her
thoughts
were
set
on
heaven
â€œwhy
did
i
dissuade
herâ€
said
isabella
to
herself
â€œi
am
punished
for
my
generosity
but
when
did
they
meet
where
it
cannot
be
i
have
deceived
myself
perhaps
last
night
was
the
first
time
they
ever
beheld
each
other
it
must
be
some
other
object
that
has
prepossessed
his
affectionsâ€”if
it
is
i
am
not
so
unhappy
as
i
thought
if
it
is
not
my
friend
matildaâ€”how
can
i
stoop
to
wish
for
the
affection
of
a
man
who
rudely
and
unnecessarily
acquainted
me
with
his
indifference
and
that
at
the
very
moment
in
which
common
courtesy
demanded
at
least
expressions
of
civility
i
will
go
to
my
dear
matilda
who
will
confirm
me
in
this
becoming
pride
man
is
falseâ€”i
will
advise
with
her
on
taking
the
veil
she
will
rejoice
to
find
me
in
this
disposition
and
i
will
acquaint
her
that
i
no
longer
oppose
her
inclination
for
the
cloisterâ€
in
this
frame
of
mind
and
determined
to
open
her
heart
entirely
to
matilda
she
went
to
that
princessâ€™s
chamber
whom
she
found
already
dressed
and
leaning
pensively
on
her
arm
this
attitude
so
correspondent
to
what
she
felt
herself
revived
isabellaâ€™s
suspicions
and
destroyed
the
confidence
she
had
purposed
to
place
in
her
friend
they
blushed
at
meeting
and
were
too
much
novices
to
disguise
their
sensations
with
address
after
some
unmeaning
questions
and
replies
matilda
demanded
of
isabella
the
cause
of
her
flight
the
latter
who
had
almost
forgotten
manfredâ€™s
passion
so
entirely
was
she
occupied
by
her
own
concluding
that
matilda
referred
to
her
last
escape
from
the
convent
which
had
occasioned
the
events
of
the
preceding
evening
repliedâ€”
â€œmartelli
brought
word
to
the
convent
that
your
mother
was
deadâ€
â€œohâ€
said
matilda
interrupting
her
â€œbianca
has
explained
that
mistake
to
me
on
seeing
me
faint
she
cried
out
â€˜the
princess
is
deadâ€™
and
martelli
who
had
come
for
the
usual
dole
to
the
castleâ€”â€
â€œand
what
made
you
faintâ€
said
isabella
indifferent
to
the
rest
matilda
blushed
and
stammeredâ€”
â€œmy
fatherâ€”he
was
sitting
in
judgment
on
a
criminalâ€”â€
â€œwhat
criminalâ€
said
isabella
eagerly
â€œa
young
manâ€
said
matilda
â€œi
believeâ€”â€
â€œi
think
it
was
that
young
man
thatâ€”â€
â€œwhat
theodoreâ€
said
isabella
â€œyesâ€
answered
she
â€œi
never
saw
him
before
i
do
not
know
how
he
had
offended
my
father
but
as
he
has
been
of
service
to
you
i
am
glad
my
lord
has
pardoned
himâ€
â€œserved
meâ€
replied
isabella
â€œdo
you
term
it
serving
me
to
wound
my
father
and
almost
occasion
his
death
though
it
is
but
since
yesterday
that
i
am
blessed
with
knowing
a
parent
i
hope
matilda
does
not
think
i
am
such
a
stranger
to
filial
tenderness
as
not
to
resent
the
boldness
of
that
audacious
youth
and
that
it
is
impossible
for
me
ever
to
feel
any
affection
for
one
who
dared
to
lift
his
arm
against
the
author
of
my
being
no
matilda
my
heart
abhors
him
and
if
you
still
retain
the
friendship
for
me
that
you
have
vowed
from
your
infancy
you
will
detest
a
man
who
has
been
on
the
point
of
making
me
miserable
for
everâ€
matilda
held
down
her
head
and
replied
â€œi
hope
my
dearest
isabella
does
not
doubt
her
matildaâ€™s
friendship
i
never
beheld
that
youth
until
yesterday
he
is
almost
a
stranger
to
me
but
as
the
surgeons
have
pronounced
your
father
out
of
danger
you
ought
not
to
harbour
uncharitable
resentment
against
one
who
i
am
persuaded
did
not
know
the
marquis
was
related
to
youâ€
â€œyou
plead
his
cause
very
patheticallyâ€
said
isabella
â€œconsidering
he
is
so
much
a
stranger
to
you
i
am
mistaken
or
he
returns
your
charityâ€
â€œwhat
mean
youâ€
said
matilda
â€œnothingâ€
said
isabella
repenting
that
she
had
given
matilda
a
hint
of
theodoreâ€™s
inclination
for
her
then
changing
the
discourse
she
asked
matilda
what
occasioned
manfred
to
take
theodore
for
a
spectre
â€œbless
meâ€
said
matilda
â€œdid
not
you
observe
his
extreme
resemblance
to
the
portrait
of
alfonso
in
the
gallery
i
took
notice
of
it
to
bianca
even
before
i
saw
him
in
armour
but
with
the
helmet
on
he
is
the
very
image
of
that
pictureâ€
â€œi
do
not
much
observe
picturesâ€
said
isabella
â€œmuch
less
have
i
examined
this
young
man
so
attentively
as
you
seem
to
have
done
ah
matilda
your
heart
is
in
danger
but
let
me
warn
you
as
a
friend
he
has
owned
to
me
that
he
is
in
love
it
cannot
be
with
you
for
yesterday
was
the
first
time
you
ever
metâ€”was
it
notâ€
â€œcertainlyâ€
replied
matilda
â€œbut
why
does
my
dearest
isabella
conclude
from
anything
i
have
said
thatâ€â€”she
pausedâ€”then
continuing
â€œhe
saw
you
first
and
i
am
far
from
having
the
vanity
to
think
that
my
little
portion
of
charms
could
engage
a
heart
devoted
to
you
may
you
be
happy
isabella
whatever
is
the
fate
of
matildaâ€
â€œmy
lovely
friendâ€
said
isabella
whose
heart
was
too
honest
to
resist
a
kind
expression
â€œit
is
you
that
theodore
admires
i
saw
it
i
am
persuaded
of
it
nor
shall
a
thought
of
my
own
happiness
suffer
me
to
interfere
with
yoursâ€
this
frankness
drew
tears
from
the
gentle
matilda
and
jealousy
that
for
a
moment
had
raised
a
coolness
between
these
amiable
maidens
soon
gave
way
to
the
natural
sincerity
and
candour
of
their
souls
each
confessed
to
the
other
the
impression
that
theodore
had
made
on
her
and
this
confidence
was
followed
by
a
struggle
of
generosity
each
insisting
on
yielding
her
claim
to
her
friend
at
length
the
dignity
of
isabellaâ€™s
virtue
reminding
her
of
the
preference
which
theodore
had
almost
declared
for
her
rival
made
her
determine
to
conquer
her
passion
and
cede
the
beloved
object
to
her
friend
during
this
contest
of
amity
hippolita
entered
her
daughterâ€™s
chamber
â€œmadamâ€
said
she
to
isabella
â€œyou
have
so
much
tenderness
for
matilda
and
interest
yourself
so
kindly
in
whatever
affects
our
wretched
house
that
i
can
have
no
secrets
with
my
child
which
are
not
proper
for
you
to
hearâ€
the
princesses
were
all
attention
and
anxiety
â€œknow
then
madamâ€
continued
hippolita
â€œand
you
my
dearest
matilda
that
being
convinced
by
all
the
events
of
these
two
last
ominous
days
that
heaven
purposes
the
sceptre
of
otranto
should
pass
from
manfredâ€™s
hands
into
those
of
the
marquis
frederic
i
have
been
perhaps
inspired
with
the
thought
of
averting
our
total
destruction
by
the
union
of
our
rival
houses
with
this
view
i
have
been
proposing
to
manfred
my
lord
to
tender
this
dear
dear
child
to
frederic
your
fatherâ€
â€œme
to
lord
fredericâ€
cried
matilda
â€œgood
heavens
my
gracious
motherâ€”and
have
you
named
it
to
my
fatherâ€
â€œi
haveâ€
said
hippolita
â€œhe
listened
benignly
to
my
proposal
and
is
gone
to
break
it
to
the
marquisâ€
â€œah
wretched
princessâ€
cried
isabella
â€œwhat
hast
thou
done
what
ruin
has
thy
inadvertent
goodness
been
preparing
for
thyself
for
me
and
for
matildaâ€
â€œruin
from
me
to
you
and
to
my
childâ€
said
hippolita
â€œwhat
can
this
meanâ€
â€œalasâ€
said
isabella
â€œthe
purity
of
your
own
heart
prevents
your
seeing
the
depravity
of
others
manfred
your
lord
that
impious
manâ€”â€
â€œholdâ€
said
hippolita
â€œyou
must
not
in
my
presence
young
lady
mention
manfred
with
disrespect
he
is
my
lord
and
husband
andâ€”â€
â€œwill
not
long
be
soâ€
said
isabella
â€œif
his
wicked
purposes
can
be
carried
into
executionâ€
â€œthis
language
amazes
meâ€
said
hippolita
â€œyour
feeling
isabella
is
warm
but
until
this
hour
i
never
knew
it
betray
you
into
intemperance
what
deed
of
manfred
authorises
you
to
treat
him
as
a
murderer
an
assassinâ€
â€œthou
virtuous
and
too
credulous
princessâ€
replied
isabella
â€œit
is
not
thy
life
he
aims
atâ€”it
is
to
separate
himself
from
thee
to
divorce
thee
toâ€”â€
â€œto
divorce
meâ€
â€œto
divorce
my
motherâ€
cried
hippolita
and
matilda
at
once
â€œyesâ€
said
isabella
â€œand
to
complete
his
crime
he
meditatesâ€”i
cannot
speak
itâ€
â€œwhat
can
surpass
what
thou
hast
already
utteredâ€
said
matilda
hippolita
was
silent
grief
choked
her
speech
and
the
recollection
of
manfredâ€™s
late
ambiguous
discourses
confirmed
what
she
heard
â€œexcellent
dear
lady
madam
motherâ€
cried
isabella
flinging
herself
at
hippolitaâ€™s
feet
in
a
transport
of
passion
â€œtrust
me
believe
me
i
will
die
a
thousand
deaths
sooner
than
consent
to
injure
you
than
yield
to
so
odiousâ€”ohâ€”â€
â€œthis
is
too
muchâ€
cried
hippolita
â€œwhat
crimes
does
one
crime
suggest
rise
dear
isabella
i
do
not
doubt
your
virtue
oh
matilda
this
stroke
is
too
heavy
for
thee
weep
not
my
child
and
not
a
murmur
i
charge
thee
remember
he
is
thy
father
stillâ€
â€œbut
you
are
my
mother
tooâ€
said
matilda
fervently
â€œand
you
are
virtuous
you
are
guiltlessâ€”oh
must
not
i
must
not
i
complainâ€
â€œyou
must
notâ€
said
hippolitaâ€”â€œcome
all
will
yet
be
well
manfred
in
the
agony
for
the
loss
of
thy
brother
knew
not
what
he
said
perhaps
isabella
misunderstood
him
his
heart
is
goodâ€”and
my
child
thou
knowest
not
all
there
is
a
destiny
hangs
over
us
the
hand
of
providence
is
stretched
out
oh
could
i
but
save
thee
from
the
wreck
yesâ€
continued
she
in
a
firmer
tone
â€œperhaps
the
sacrifice
of
myself
may
atone
for
all
i
will
go
and
offer
myself
to
this
divorceâ€”it
boots
not
what
becomes
of
me
i
will
withdraw
into
the
neighbouring
monastery
and
waste
the
remainder
of
life
in
prayers
and
tears
for
my
child
andâ€”the
princeâ€
â€œthou
art
as
much
too
good
for
this
worldâ€
said
isabella
â€œas
manfred
is
execrable
but
think
not
lady
that
thy
weakness
shall
determine
for
me
i
swear
hear
me
all
ye
angelsâ€”â€
â€œstop
i
adjure
theeâ€
cried
hippolita
â€œremember
thou
dost
not
depend
on
thyself
thou
hast
a
fatherâ€
â€œmy
father
is
too
pious
too
nobleâ€
interrupted
isabella
â€œto
command
an
impious
deed
but
should
he
command
it
can
a
father
enjoin
a
cursed
act
i
was
contracted
to
the
son
can
i
wed
the
father
no
madam
no
force
should
not
drag
me
to
manfredâ€™s
hated
bed
i
loathe
him
i
abhor
him
divine
and
human
laws
forbidâ€”and
my
friend
my
dearest
matilda
would
i
wound
her
tender
soul
by
injuring
her
adored
mother
my
own
motherâ€”i
never
have
known
anotherâ€â€”
â€œoh
she
is
the
mother
of
bothâ€
cried
matilda
â€œcan
we
can
we
isabella
adore
her
too
muchâ€
â€œmy
lovely
childrenâ€
said
the
touched
hippolita
â€œyour
tenderness
overpowers
meâ€”but
i
must
not
give
way
to
it
it
is
not
ours
to
make
election
for
ourselves
heaven
our
fathers
and
our
husbands
must
decide
for
us
have
patience
until
you
hear
what
manfred
and
frederic
have
determined
if
the
marquis
accepts
matildaâ€™s
hand
i
know
she
will
readily
obey
heaven
may
interpose
and
prevent
the
rest
what
means
my
childâ€
continued
she
seeing
matilda
fall
at
her
feet
with
a
flood
of
speechless
tearsâ€”â€œbut
no
answer
me
not
my
daughter
i
must
not
hear
a
word
against
the
pleasure
of
thy
fatherâ€
â€œoh
doubt
not
my
obedience
my
dreadful
obedience
to
him
and
to
youâ€
said
matilda
â€œbut
can
i
most
respected
of
women
can
i
experience
all
this
tenderness
this
world
of
goodness
and
conceal
a
thought
from
the
best
of
mothersâ€
â€œwhat
art
thou
going
to
utterâ€
said
isabella
trembling
â€œrecollect
thyself
matildaâ€
â€œno
isabellaâ€
said
the
princess
â€œi
should
not
deserve
this
incomparable
parent
if
the
inmost
recesses
of
my
soul
harboured
a
thought
without
her
permissionâ€”nay
i
have
offended
her
i
have
suffered
a
passion
to
enter
my
heart
without
her
avowalâ€”but
here
i
disclaim
it
here
i
vow
to
heaven
and
herâ€”â€
â€œmy
child
my
childâ€
said
hippolita
â€œwhat
words
are
these
what
new
calamities
has
fate
in
store
for
us
thou
a
passion
thou
in
this
hour
of
destructionâ€”â€
â€œoh
i
see
all
my
guiltâ€
said
matilda
â€œi
abhor
myself
if
i
cost
my
mother
a
pang
she
is
the
dearest
thing
i
have
on
earthâ€”oh
i
will
never
never
behold
him
moreâ€
â€œisabellaâ€
said
hippolita
â€œthou
art
conscious
to
this
unhappy
secret
whatever
it
is
speakâ€
â€œwhatâ€
cried
matilda
â€œhave
i
so
forfeited
my
motherâ€™s
love
that
she
will
not
permit
me
even
to
speak
my
own
guilt
oh
wretched
wretched
matildaâ€
â€œthou
art
too
cruelâ€
said
isabella
to
hippolita
â€œcanst
thou
behold
this
anguish
of
a
virtuous
mind
and
not
commiserate
itâ€
â€œnot
pity
my
childâ€
said
hippolita
catching
matilda
in
her
armsâ€”â€œoh
i
know
she
is
good
she
is
all
virtue
all
tenderness
and
duty
i
do
forgive
thee
my
excellent
my
only
hopeâ€
the
princesses
then
revealed
to
hippolita
their
mutual
inclination
for
theodore
and
the
purpose
of
isabella
to
resign
him
to
matilda
hippolita
blamed
their
imprudence
and
showed
them
the
improbability
that
either
father
would
consent
to
bestow
his
heiress
on
so
poor
a
man
though
nobly
born
some
comfort
it
gave
her
to
find
their
passion
of
so
recent
a
date
and
that
theodore
had
had
but
little
cause
to
suspect
it
in
either
she
strictly
enjoined
them
to
avoid
all
correspondence
with
him
this
matilda
fervently
promised
but
isabella
who
flattered
herself
that
she
meant
no
more
than
to
promote
his
union
with
her
friend
could
not
determine
to
avoid
him
and
made
no
reply
â€œi
will
go
to
the
conventâ€
said
hippolita
â€œand
order
new
masses
to
be
said
for
a
deliverance
from
these
calamitiesâ€
â€œoh
my
motherâ€
said
matilda
â€œyou
mean
to
quit
us
you
mean
to
take
sanctuary
and
to
give
my
father
an
opportunity
of
pursuing
his
fatal
intention
alas
on
my
knees
i
supplicate
you
to
forbear
will
you
leave
me
a
prey
to
frederic
i
will
follow
you
to
the
conventâ€
â€œbe
at
peace
my
childâ€
said
hippolita
â€œi
will
return
instantly
i
will
never
abandon
thee
until
i
know
it
is
the
will
of
heaven
and
for
thy
benefitâ€
â€œdo
not
deceive
meâ€
said
matilda
â€œi
will
not
marry
frederic
until
thou
commandest
it
alas
what
will
become
of
meâ€
â€œwhy
that
exclamationâ€
said
hippolita
â€œi
have
promised
thee
to
returnâ€”â€
â€œah
my
motherâ€
replied
matilda
â€œstay
and
save
me
from
myself
a
frown
from
thee
can
do
more
than
all
my
fatherâ€™s
severity
i
have
given
away
my
heart
and
you
alone
can
make
me
recall
itâ€
â€œno
moreâ€
said
hippolita
â€œthou
must
not
relapse
matildaâ€
â€œi
can
quit
theodoreâ€
said
she
â€œbut
must
i
wed
another
let
me
attend
thee
to
the
altar
and
shut
myself
from
the
world
for
everâ€
â€œthy
fate
depends
on
thy
fatherâ€
said
hippolita
â€œi
have
ill-bestowed
my
tenderness
if
it
has
taught
thee
to
revere
aught
beyond
him
adieu
my
child
i
go
to
pray
for
theeâ€
hippolitaâ€™s
real
purpose
was
to
demand
of
jerome
whether
in
conscience
she
might
not
consent
to
the
divorce
she
had
oft
urged
manfred
to
resign
the
principality
which
the
delicacy
of
her
conscience
rendered
an
hourly
burthen
to
her
these
scruples
concurred
to
make
the
separation
from
her
husband
appear
less
dreadful
to
her
than
it
would
have
seemed
in
any
other
situation
jerome
at
quitting
the
castle
overnight
had
questioned
theodore
severely
why
he
had
accused
him
to
manfred
of
being
privy
to
his
escape
theodore
owned
it
had
been
with
design
to
prevent
manfredâ€™s
suspicion
from
alighting
on
matilda
and
added
the
holiness
of
jeromeâ€™s
life
and
character
secured
him
from
the
tyrantâ€™s
wrath
jerome
was
heartily
grieved
to
discover
his
sonâ€™s
inclination
for
that
princess
and
leaving
him
to
his
rest
promised
in
the
morning
to
acquaint
him
with
important
reasons
for
conquering
his
passion
theodore
like
isabella
was
too
recently
acquainted
with
parental
authority
to
submit
to
its
decisions
against
the
impulse
of
his
heart
he
had
little
curiosity
to
learn
the
friarâ€™s
reasons
and
less
disposition
to
obey
them
the
lovely
matilda
had
made
stronger
impressions
on
him
than
filial
affection
all
night
he
pleased
himself
with
visions
of
love
and
it
was
not
till
late
after
the
morning-office
that
he
recollected
the
friarâ€™s
commands
to
attend
him
at
alfonsoâ€™s
tomb
â€œyoung
manâ€
said
jerome
when
he
saw
him
â€œthis
tardiness
does
not
please
me
have
a
fatherâ€™s
commands
already
so
little
weightâ€
theodore
made
awkward
excuses
and
attributed
his
delay
to
having
overslept
himself
â€œand
on
whom
were
thy
dreams
employedâ€
said
the
friar
sternly
his
son
blushed
â€œcome
comeâ€
resumed
the
friar
â€œinconsiderate
youth
this
must
not
be
eradicate
this
guilty
passion
from
thy
breastâ€”â€
â€œguilty
passionâ€
cried
theodore
â€œcan
guilt
dwell
with
innocent
beauty
and
virtuous
modestyâ€
â€œit
is
sinfulâ€
replied
the
friar
â€œto
cherish
those
whom
heaven
has
doomed
to
destruction
a
tyrantâ€™s
race
must
be
swept
from
the
earth
to
the
third
and
fourth
generationâ€
â€œwill
heaven
visit
the
innocent
for
the
crimes
of
the
guiltyâ€
said
theodore
â€œthe
fair
matilda
has
virtues
enoughâ€”â€
â€œto
undo
theeâ€
interrupted
jerome
â€œhast
thou
so
soon
forgotten
that
twice
the
savage
manfred
has
pronounced
thy
sentenceâ€
â€œnor
have
i
forgotten
sirâ€
said
theodore
â€œthat
the
charity
of
his
daughter
delivered
me
from
his
power
i
can
forget
injuries
but
never
benefitsâ€
â€œthe
injuries
thou
hast
received
from
manfredâ€™s
raceâ€
said
the
friar
â€œare
beyond
what
thou
canst
conceive

holy
image

marble
monument

headstrong
boy
and
list
while
a
father
unfolds
a
tale
of
horror
that
will
expel
every
sentiment
from
thy
soul
but
sensations
of
sacred
vengeanceâ€”alfonso
much
injured
prince
let
thy
unsatisfied
shade
sit
awful
on
the
troubled
air
while
these
trembling
lipsâ€”ha
who
comes
thereâ€”â€
â€œthe
most
wretched
of
womenâ€
said
hippolita
entering
the
choir
â€œgood
father
art
thou
at
leisureâ€”but
why
this
kneeling
youth
what
means
the
horror
imprinted
on
each
countenance
why
at
this
venerable
tombâ€”alas
hast
thou
seen
aughtâ€
â€œwe
were
pouring
forth
our
orisons
to
heavenâ€
replied
the
friar
with
some
confusion
â€œto
put
an
end
to
the
woes
of
this
deplorable
province

with
us
lady
thy
spotless
soul
may
obtain
an
exemption
from
the
judgments
which
the
portents
of
these
days
but
too
speakingly
denounce
against
thy
houseâ€
â€œi
pray
fervently
to
heaven
to
divert
themâ€
said
the
pious
princess
â€œthou
knowest
it
has
been
the
occupation
of
my
life
to
wrest
a
blessing
for
my
lord
and
my
harmless
childrenâ€”one
alas
is
taken
from
me
would
heaven
but
hear
me
for
my
poor
matilda
father
intercede
for
herâ€
â€œevery
heart
will
bless
herâ€
cried
theodore
with
rapture
â€œbe
dumb
rash
youthâ€
said
jerome
â€œand
thou
fond
princess
contend
not
with
the
powers
above
the
lord
giveth
and
the
lord
taketh
away
bless
his
holy
name
and
submit
to
his
decreesâ€
â€œi
do
most
devoutlyâ€
said
hippolita
â€œbut
will
he
not
spare
my
only
comfort
must
matilda
perish
tooâ€”ah
father
i
cameâ€”but
dismiss
thy
son
no
ear
but
thine
must
hear
what
i
have
to
utterâ€
â€œmay
heaven
grant
thy
every
wish
most
excellent
princessâ€
said
theodore
retiring
jerome
frowned
hippolita
then
acquainted
the
friar
with
the
proposal
she
had
suggested
to
manfred
his
approbation
of
it
and
the
tender
of
matilda
that
he
was
gone
to
make
to
frederic
jerome
could
not
conceal
his
dislike
of
the
notion
which
he
covered
under
pretence
of
the
improbability
that
frederic
the
nearest
of
blood
to
alfonso
and
who
was
come
to
claim
his
succession
would
yield
to
an
alliance
with
the
usurper
of
his
right
but
nothing
could
equal
the
perplexity
of
the
friar
when
hippolita
confessed
her
readiness
not
to
oppose
the
separation
and
demanded
his
opinion
on
the
legality
of
her
acquiescence
the
friar
caught
eagerly
at
her
request
of
his
advice
and
without
explaining
his
aversion
to
the
proposed
marriage
of
manfred
and
isabella
he
painted
to
hippolita
in
the
most
alarming
colours
the
sinfulness
of
her
consent
denounced
judgments
against
her
if
she
complied
and
enjoined
her
in
the
severest
terms
to
treat
any
such
proposition
with
every
mark
of
indignation
and
refusal
manfred
in
the
meantime
had
broken
his
purpose
to
frederic
and
proposed
the
double
marriage
that
weak
prince
who
had
been
struck
with
the
charms
of
matilda
listened
but
too
eagerly
to
the
offer
he
forgot
his
enmity
to
manfred
whom
he
saw
but
little
hope
of
dispossessing
by
force
and
flattering
himself
that
no
issue
might
succeed
from
the
union
of
his
daughter
with
the
tyrant
he
looked
upon
his
own
succession
to
the
principality
as
facilitated
by
wedding
matilda
he
made
faint
opposition
to
the
proposal
affecting
for
form
only
not
to
acquiesce
unless
hippolita
should
consent
to
the
divorce
manfred
took
that
upon
himself
transported
with
his
success
and
impatient
to
see
himself
in
a
situation
to
expect
sons
he
hastened
to
his
wifeâ€™s
apartment
determined
to
extort
her
compliance
he
learned
with
indignation
that
she
was
absent
at
the
convent
his
guilt
suggested
to
him
that
she
had
probably
been
informed
by
isabella
of
his
purpose
he
doubted
whether
her
retirement
to
the
convent
did
not
import
an
intention
of
remaining
there
until
she
could
raise
obstacles
to
their
divorce
and
the
suspicions
he
had
already
entertained
of
jerome
made
him
apprehend
that
the
friar
would
not
only
traverse
his
views
but
might
have
inspired
hippolita
with
the
resolution
of
talking
sanctuary
impatient
to
unravel
this
clue
and
to
defeat
its
success
manfred
hastened
to
the
convent
and
arrived
there
as
the
friar
was
earnestly
exhorting
the
princess
never
to
yield
to
the
divorce
â€œmadamâ€
said
manfred
â€œwhat
business
drew
you
hither
why
did
you
not
await
my
return
from
the
marquisâ€
â€œi
came
to
implore
a
blessing
on
your
councilsâ€
replied
hippolita
â€œmy
councils
do
not
need
a
friarâ€™s
interventionâ€
said
manfred
â€œand
of
all
men
living
is
that
hoary
traitor
the
only
one
whom
you
delight
to
confer
withâ€
â€œprofane
princeâ€
said
jerome
â€œis
it
at
the
altar
that
thou
choosest
to
insult
the
servants
of
the
altarâ€”but
manfred
thy
impious
schemes
are
known
heaven
and
this
virtuous
lady
know
themâ€”nay
frown
not
prince
the
church
despises
thy
menaces
her
thunders
will
be
heard
above
thy
wrath
dare
to
proceed
in
thy
cursed
purpose
of
a
divorce
until
her
sentence
be
known
and
here
i
lance
her
anathema
at
thy
headâ€
â€œaudacious
rebelâ€
said
manfred
endeavouring
to
conceal
the
awe
with
which
the
friarâ€™s
words
inspired
him
â€œdost
thou
presume
to
threaten
thy
lawful
princeâ€
â€œthou
art
no
lawful
princeâ€
said
jerome
â€œthou
art
no
princeâ€”go
discuss
thy
claim
with
frederic
and
when
that
is
doneâ€”â€
â€œit
is
doneâ€
replied
manfred
â€œfrederic
accepts
matildaâ€™s
hand
and
is
content
to
waive
his
claim
unless
i
have
no
male
issueâ€â€”as
he
spoke
those
words
three
drops
of
blood
fell
from
the
nose
of
alfonsoâ€™s
statue
manfred
turned
pale
and
the
princess
sank
on
her
knees
â€œbeholdâ€
said
the
friar
â€œmark
this
miraculous
indication
that
the
blood
of
alfonso
will
never
mix
with
that
of
manfredâ€
â€œmy
gracious
lordâ€
said
hippolita
â€œlet
us
submit
ourselves
to
heaven
think
not
thy
ever
obedient
wife
rebels
against
thy
authority
i
have
no
will
but
that
of
my
lord
and
the
church
to
that
revered
tribunal
let
us
appeal
it
does
not
depend
on
us
to
burst
the
bonds
that
unite
us
if
the
church
shall
approve
the
dissolution
of
our
marriage
be
it
soâ€”i
have
but
few
years
and
those
of
sorrow
to
pass
where
can
they
be
worn
away
so
well
as
at
the
foot
of
this
altar
in
prayers
for
thine
and
matildaâ€™s
safetyâ€
â€œbut
thou
shalt
not
remain
here
until
thenâ€
said
manfred
â€œrepair
with
me
to
the
castle
and
there
i
will
advise
on
the
proper
measures
for
a
divorceâ€”but
this
meddling
friar
comes
not
thither
my
hospitable
roof
shall
never
more
harbour
a
traitorâ€”and
for
thy
reverenceâ€™s
offspringâ€
continued
he
â€œi
banish
him
from
my
dominions
he
i
ween
is
no
sacred
personage
nor
under
the
protection
of
the
church
whoever
weds
isabella
it
shall
not
be
father
falconaraâ€™s
started-up
sonâ€
â€œthey
start
upâ€
said
the
friar
â€œwho
are
suddenly
beheld
in
the
seat
of
lawful
princes
but
they
wither
away
like
the
grass
and
their
place
knows
them
no
moreâ€
manfred
casting
a
look
of
scorn
at
the
friar
led
hippolita
forth
but
at
the
door
of
the
church
whispered
one
of
his
attendants
to
remain
concealed
about
the
convent
and
bring
him
instant
notice
if
any
one
from
the
castle
should
repair
thither
every
reflection
which
manfred
made
on
the
friarâ€™s
behaviour
conspired
to
persuade
him
that
jerome
was
privy
to
an
amour
between
isabella
and
theodore
but
jeromeâ€™s
new
presumption
so
dissonant
from
his
former
meekness
suggested
still
deeper
apprehensions
the
prince
even
suspected
that
the
friar
depended
on
some
secret
support
from
frederic
whose
arrival
coinciding
with
the
novel
appearance
of
theodore
seemed
to
bespeak
a
correspondence
still
more
was
he
troubled
with
the
resemblance
of
theodore
to
alfonsoâ€™s
portrait
the
latter
he
knew
had
unquestionably
died
without
issue
frederic
had
consented
to
bestow
isabella
on
him
these
contradictions
agitated
his
mind
with
numberless
pangs
he
saw
but
two
methods
of
extricating
himself
from
his
difficulties
the
one
was
to
resign
his
dominions
to
the
marquisâ€”pride
ambition
and
his
reliance
on
ancient
prophecies
which
had
pointed
out
a
possibility
of
his
preserving
them
to
his
posterity
combated
that
thought
the
other
was
to
press
his
marriage
with
isabella
after
long
ruminating
on
these
anxious
thoughts
as
he
marched
silently
with
hippolita
to
the
castle
he
at
last
discoursed
with
that
princess
on
the
subject
of
his
disquiet
and
used
every
insinuating
and
plausible
argument
to
extract
her
consent
to
even
her
promise
of
promoting
the
divorce
hippolita
needed
little
persuasions
to
bend
her
to
his
pleasure
she
endeavoured
to
win
him
over
to
the
measure
of
resigning
his
dominions
but
finding
her
exhortations
fruitless
she
assured
him
that
as
far
as
her
conscience
would
allow
she
would
raise
no
opposition
to
a
separation
though
without
better
founded
scruples
than
what
he
yet
alleged
she
would
not
engage
to
be
active
in
demanding
it
this
compliance
though
inadequate
was
sufficient
to
raise
manfredâ€™s
hopes
he
trusted
that
his
power
and
wealth
would
easily
advance
his
suit
at
the
court
of
rome
whither
he
resolved
to
engage
frederic
to
take
a
journey
on
purpose
that
prince
had
discovered
so
much
passion
for
matilda
that
manfred
hoped
to
obtain
all
he
wished
by
holding
out
or
withdrawing
his
daughterâ€™s
charms
according
as
the
marquis
should
appear
more
or
less
disposed
to
co-operate
in
his
views
even
the
absence
of
frederic
would
be
a
material
point
gained
until
he
could
take
further
measures
for
his
security
dismissing
hippolita
to
her
apartment
he
repaired
to
that
of
the
marquis
but
crossing
the
great
hall
through
which
he
was
to
pass
he
met
bianca
the
damsel
he
knew
was
in
the
confidence
of
both
the
young
ladies
it
immediately
occurred
to
him
to
sift
her
on
the
subject
of
isabella
and
theodore
calling
her
aside
into
the
recess
of
the
oriel
window
of
the
hall
and
soothing
her
with
many
fair
words
and
promises
he
demanded
of
her
whether
she
knew
aught
of
the
state
of
isabellaâ€™s
affections
â€œi
my
lord
no
my
lordâ€”yes
my
lordâ€”poor
lady
she
is
wonderfully
alarmed
about
her
fatherâ€™s
wounds
but
i
tell
her
he
will
do
well
donâ€™t
your
highness
think
soâ€
â€œi
do
not
ask
youâ€
replied
manfred
â€œwhat
she
thinks
about
her
father
but
you
are
in
her
secrets
come
be
a
good
girl
and
tell
me
is
there
any
young
manâ€”haâ€”you
understand
meâ€
â€œlord
bless
me
understand
your
highness
no
not
i
i
told
her
a
few
vulnerary
herbs
and
reposeâ€”â€
â€œi
am
not
talkingâ€
replied
the
prince
impatiently
â€œabout
her
father
i
know
he
will
do
wellâ€
â€œbless
me
i
rejoice
to
hear
your
highness
say
so
for
though
i
thought
it
not
right
to
let
my
young
lady
despond
methought
his
greatness
had
a
wan
look
and
a
somethingâ€”i
remember
when
young
ferdinand
was
wounded
by
the
venetianâ€”â€
â€œthou
answerest
from
the
pointâ€
interrupted
manfred
â€œbut
here
take
this
jewel
perhaps
that
may
fix
thy
attentionâ€”nay
no
reverences
my
favour
shall
not
stop
hereâ€”come
tell
me
truly
how
stands
isabellaâ€™s
heartâ€
â€œwell
your
highness
has
such
a
wayâ€
said
bianca
â€œto
be
sureâ€”but
can
your
highness
keep
a
secret
if
it
should
ever
come
out
of
your
lipsâ€”â€
â€œit
shall
not
it
shall
notâ€
cried
manfred
â€œnay
but
swear
your
highnessâ€
â€œby
my
halidame
if
it
should
ever
be
known
that
i
said
itâ€”â€
â€œwhy
truth
is
truth
i
do
not
think
my
lady
isabella
ever
much
affectioned
my
young
lord
your
son
yet
he
was
a
sweet
youth
as
one
should
see
i
am
sure
if
i
had
been
a
princessâ€”but
bless
me
i
must
attend
my
lady
matilda
she
will
marvel
what
is
become
of
meâ€
â€œstayâ€
cried
manfred
â€œthou
hast
not
satisfied
my
question
hast
thou
ever
carried
any
message
any
letterâ€
â€œi
good
graciousâ€
cried
bianca
â€œi
carry
a
letter
i
would
not
to
be
a
queen
i
hope
your
highness
thinks
though
i
am
poor
i
am
honest
did
your
highness
never
hear
what
count
marsigli
offered
me
when
he
came
a
wooing
to
my
lady
matildaâ€
â€œi
have
not
leisureâ€
said
manfred
â€œto
listen
to
thy
tale
i
do
not
question
thy
honesty
but
it
is
thy
duty
to
conceal
nothing
from
me
how
long
has
isabella
been
acquainted
with
theodoreâ€
â€œnay
there
is
nothing
can
escape
your
highnessâ€
said
bianca
â€œnot
that
i
know
any
thing
of
the
matter
theodore
to
be
sure
is
a
proper
young
man
and
as
my
lady
matilda
says
the
very
image
of
good
alfonso
has
not
your
highness
remarked
itâ€
â€œyes
yesâ€”noâ€”thou
torturest
meâ€
said
manfred
â€œwhere
did
they
meet
whenâ€
â€œwho
my

bianca
â€œno
no
not
matilda

when
did
isabella
first
become
acquainted
with
this
theodoreâ€
â€œvirgin
maryâ€

bianca
â€œhow
should
i
knowâ€
â€œthou
dost

said
manfred
â€œand
i
must
know
i
willâ€”â€
â€œlord
your
highness
is
not
jealous
of
young
theodoreâ€
said
bianca
â€œjealous
no
no
why
should
i
be
jealous
perhaps
i
mean
to
unite
themâ€”if
i
were
sure
isabella
would
have
no
repugnanceâ€
â€œrepugnance
no
iâ€™ll
warrant
herâ€
said
bianca
â€œhe
is
as
comely

manfred
after
some
general
conversation
desired
frederic
to
dismiss
the
two
knights
his
companions
having
to
talk
with
him
on
urgent
affairs
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
he
began
in
artful
guise
to
sound
the
marquis
on
the
subject
of
matilda
and
finding
him
disposed
to
his
wish
he
let
drop
hints
on
the
difficulties
that
would
attend
the
celebration
of
their
marriage
unlessâ€”at
that
instant
bianca
burst
into
the
room
with
a
wildness
in
her
look
and
gestures
that
spoke
the
utmost
terror
â€œoh
my
lord
my
lordâ€
cried
she
â€œwe
are
all
undone
it
is
come
again
it
is
come
againâ€
â€œwhat
is
come
againâ€
cried
manfred
amazed
â€œoh
the
hand
the
giant
the
handâ€”support
me
i
am
terrified
out
of
my

bianca
â€œi
will
not

in

â€œwhat
has
terrified
thee

the
marquis
â€œthou

safe

not
alarmedâ€
â€œoh
your
greatness
is
wonderfully
goodâ€
said
bianca
â€œbut
i
dare
notâ€”no
pray
let
me
goâ€”i
had
rather
leave
everything
behind
me
than
stay
another
hour
under
this
roofâ€
â€œgo
to
thou
hast
lost
thy

said
manfred
â€œinterrupt

â€œoh
the

bianca
â€œfor
certain
it
comes
to

it
appear
to
me
else
i

if
your
highness
had
believed
diego
â€™tis
the
same
hand
that
he
saw
the
foot
to

gallery-chamberâ€”father
jerome

manfred
in
a
rage
â€œbe
gone

said
frederic
â€œcan
your

listenâ€
said
manfred
â€œto
the
delirium
of

silly
wench

has
heard
stories
of
apparitions
until
she
believes
themâ€
â€œthis
is
more
than
fancyâ€
said
the
marquis
â€œher
terror
is
too
natural

too
strongly
impressed

the
work
of
imagination

maiden

moved
thee
thusâ€
â€œyes
my

your
greatnessâ€
said
bianca
â€œi
believe
i
look
very
pale
i
shall
be
better
when
i
have
recovered
myselfâ€”i
was
going
to
my

isabellaâ€™s
chamber
by
his

orderâ€”â€
â€œwe
do
not

interrupted
manfred
â€œsince

will
have
it
so

be
briefâ€
â€œlord
your

thwarts
one
soâ€

bianca
â€œi
fear
my

am
sure
i
never
in

as
i
was
telling
your

i
was
going
by
his

order
to
my
lady
isabellaâ€™s
chamber
she
lies
in
the
watchet-coloured
chamber
on
the
right
hand
one
pair
of
stairs
so
when
i
came
to
the
great
stairsâ€”i
was
looking
on
his
highnessâ€™s
present
hereâ€”â€
â€œgrant
me
patienceâ€
said
manfred
â€œwill
this

says
he
heard
when
the
giant
turned
him
about
in
the
gallery-chamberâ€
â€œwhat
giant
is
this
my
lordâ€
said
the
marquis
â€œis
your
castle
haunted
by
giants
and
goblinsâ€
â€œlord
what
has
not
your
greatness
heard
the
story
of
the
giant
in
the
gallery-chamberâ€
cried
bianca
â€œi
marvel
his
highness
has
not
told
you
mayhap
you
do
not
know
there
is
a
prophecyâ€”â€
â€œthis
trifling
is
intolerableâ€
interrupted
manfred
â€œlet
us
dismiss
this
silly
wench
my
lord
we
have
more
important
affairs
to
discussâ€
â€œby
your
favourâ€
said
frederic
â€œthese
are
no
trifles
the
enormous
sabre
i
was
directed
to
in
the
wood
yon
casque
its
fellowâ€”are
these
visions
of
this
poor
maidenâ€™s
brainâ€
â€œso
jaquez
thinks
may
it
please
your
greatnessâ€
said
bianca
â€œhe
says
this
moon
will
not
be
out
without
our
seeing
some
strange
revolution
for
my
part
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
it
was
to
happen
to-morrow
for
as
i
was
saying
when
i
heard
the
clattering
of
armour
i
was
all
in
a
cold
sweat
i
looked
up
and
if
your
greatness
will
believe
me
i
saw
upon
the
uppermost
banister
of
the
great
stairs
a
hand
in
armour
as
big
as
big
i
thought
i
should
have
swooned
i
never
stopped
until
i
came
hitherâ€”would
i
were
well
out
of
this
castle
my
lady
matilda
told
me
but
yester-morning
that
her
highness
hippolita
knows
somethingâ€
â€œthou
art
an
insolentâ€
cried
manfred
â€œlord
marquis
it
much
misgives
me
that
this
scene
is
concerted
to
affront
me
are
my
own
domestics
suborned
to
spread
tales
injurious
to
my
honour
pursue
your
claim
by
manly
daring
or
let
us
bury
our
feuds
as
was
proposed
by
the
intermarriage
of
our
children
but
trust
me
it
ill
becomes
a
prince
of
your
bearing
to
practise
on
mercenary
wenchesâ€
â€œi
scorn
your
imputationâ€
said
frederic
â€œuntil
this
hour
i
never
set
eyes
on
this
damsel
i
have
given
her
no
jewel
my
lord
my
lord
your
conscience
your
guilt
accuses
you
and
would
throw
the
suspicion
on
me
but
keep
your
daughter
and
think
no
more
of
isabella
the
judgments
already
fallen
on
your
house
forbid
me
matching
into
itâ€
manfred
alarmed
at
the
resolute
tone
in
which
frederic
delivered
these
words
endeavoured
to
pacify
him
dismissing
bianca
he
made
such
submissions
to
the
marquis
and
threw
in
such
artful
encomiums
on
matilda
that
frederic
was
once
more
staggered
however
as
his
passion
was
of
so
recent
a
date
it
could
not
at
once
surmount
the
scruples
he
had
conceived
he
had
gathered
enough
from
biancaâ€™s
discourse
to
persuade
him
that
heaven
declared
itself
against
manfred
the
proposed
marriages
too
removed
his
claim
to
a
distance
and
the
principality
of
otranto
was
a
stronger
temptation
than
the
contingent
reversion
of
it
with
matilda
still
he
would
not
absolutely
recede
from
his
engagements
but
purposing
to
gain
time
he
demanded
of
manfred
if
it
was
true
in
fact
that
hippolita
consented
to
the
divorce
the
prince
transported
to
find
no
other
obstacle
and
depending
on
his
influence
over
his
wife
assured
the
marquis
it
was
so
and
that
he
might
satisfy
himself
of
the
truth
from
her
own
mouth
as
they
were
thus
discoursing
word
was
brought
that
the
banquet
was
prepared
manfred
conducted
frederic
to
the
great
hall
where
they
were
received
by
hippolita
and
the
young
princesses
manfred
placed
the
marquis
next
to
matilda
and
seated
himself
between
his
wife
and
isabella
hippolita
comported
herself
with
an
easy
gravity
but
the
young
ladies
were
silent
and
melancholy
manfred
who
was
determined
to
pursue
his
point
with
the
marquis
in
the
remainder
of
the
evening
pushed
on
the
feast
until
it
waxed
late
affecting
unrestrained
gaiety
and
plying
frederic
with
repeated
goblets
of
wine
the
latter
more
upon
his
guard
than
manfred
wished
declined
his
frequent
challenges
on
pretence
of
his
late
loss
of
blood
while
the
prince
to
raise
his
own
disordered
spirits
and
to
counterfeit
unconcern
indulged
himself
in
plentiful
draughts
though
not
to
the
intoxication
of
his
senses
the
evening
being
far
advanced
the
banquet
concluded
manfred
would
have
withdrawn
with
frederic
but
the
latter
pleading
weakness
and
want
of
repose
retired
to
his
chamber
gallantly
telling
the
prince
that
his
daughter
should
amuse
his
highness
until
himself
could
attend
him
manfred
accepted
the
party
and
to
the
no
small
grief
of
isabella
accompanied
her
to
her
apartment
matilda
waited
on
her
mother
to
enjoy
the
freshness
of
the
evening
on
the
ramparts
of
the
castle
soon
as
the
company
were
dispersed
their
several
ways
frederic
quitting
his
chamber
inquired
if
hippolita
was
alone
and
was
told
by
one
of
her
attendants
who
had
not
noticed
her
going
forth
that
at
that
hour
she
generally
withdrew
to
her
oratory
where
he
probably
would
find
her
the
marquis
during
the
repast
had
beheld
matilda
with
increase
of
passion
he
now
wished
to
find
hippolita
in
the
disposition
her
lord
had
promised
the
portents
that
had
alarmed
him
were
forgotten
in
his
desires
stealing
softly
and
unobserved
to
the
apartment
of
hippolita
he
entered
it
with
a
resolution
to
encourage
her
acquiescence
to
the
divorce
having
perceived
that
manfred
was
resolved
to
make
the
possession
of
isabella
an
unalterable
condition
before
he
would
grant
matilda
to
his
wishes
the
marquis
was
not
surprised
at
the
silence
that
reigned
in
the
princessâ€™s
apartment
concluding
her
as
he
had
been
advertised
in
her
oratory
he
passed
on
the
door
was
ajar
the
evening
gloomy
and
overcast
pushing
open
the
door
gently
he
saw
a
person
kneeling
before
the
altar
as
he
approached
nearer
it
seemed
not
a
woman
but
one
in
a
long
woollen
weed
whose
back
was
towards
him
the
person
seemed
absorbed
in
prayer
the
marquis
was
about
to
return
when
the
figure
rising
stood
some
moments
fixed
in
meditation
without
regarding
him
the
marquis
expecting
the
holy
person
to
come
forth
and
meaning
to
excuse
his
uncivil
interruption
said
â€œreverend
father
i
sought
the
lady
hippolitaâ€
â€œhippolitaâ€
replied
a
hollow
voice
â€œcamest
thou
to
this
castle
to
seek
hippolitaâ€
and
then
the
figure
turning
slowly
round
discovered
to
frederic
the
fleshless
jaws
and
empty
sockets
of
a
skeleton
wrapt
in
a
hermitâ€™s
cowl
â€œangels
of
grace
protect
meâ€
cried
frederic
recoiling
â€œdeserve
their
protectionâ€
said
the
spectre
frederic
falling
on
his
knees
adjured
the
phantom
to
take
pity
on
him
â€œdost
thou
not
remember
meâ€
said
the
apparition
â€œremember
the
wood
of
joppaâ€
â€œart
thou
that
holy
hermitâ€
cried
frederic
trembling
â€œcan
i
do
aught
for
thy
eternal
peaceâ€
â€œwast
thou
delivered
from
bondageâ€
said
the
spectre
â€œto
pursue
carnal
delights
hast
thou
forgotten
the
buried
sabre
and
the
behest
of
heaven
engraven
on
itâ€
â€œi
have
not
i
have
notâ€
said
frederic
â€œbut
say
blest
spirit
what
is
thy
errand
to
me
what
remains
to
be
doneâ€
â€œto
forget
matildaâ€
said
the
apparition
and
vanished
fredericâ€™s
blood
froze
in
his
veins
for
some
minutes
he
remained
motionless
then
falling
prostrate
on
his
face
before
the
altar
he
besought
the
intercession
of
every
saint
for
pardon
a
flood
of
tears
succeeded
to
this
transport
and
the
image
of
the
beauteous
matilda
rushing
in
spite
of
him
on
his
thoughts
he
lay
on
the
ground
in
a
conflict
of
penitence
and
passion
ere
he
could
recover
from
this
agony
of
his
spirits
the
princess
hippolita
with
a
taper
in
her
hand
entered
the
oratory
alone
seeing
a
man
without
motion
on
the
floor
she
gave
a
shriek
concluding
him
dead
her
fright
brought
frederic
to
himself
rising
suddenly
his
face
bedewed
with
tears
he
would
have
rushed
from
her
presence
but
hippolita
stopping
him
conjured
him
in
the
most
plaintive
accents
to
explain
the
cause
of
his
disorder
and
by
what
strange
chance
she
had
found
him
there
in
that
posture
â€œah
virtuous
princessâ€
said
the
marquis
penetrated
with
grief
and
stopped
â€œfor
the
love
of
heaven
my
lordâ€
said
hippolita
â€œdisclose
the
cause
of
this
transport
what
mean
these
doleful
sounds
this
alarming
exclamation
on
my
name
what
woes
has
heaven
still
in
store
for
the
wretched
hippolita
yet
silent
by
every
pitying
angel
i
adjure
thee
noble
princeâ€
continued
she
falling
at
his
feet
â€œto
disclose
the
purport
of
what
lies
at
thy
heart
i
see
thou
feelest
for
me
thou
feelest
the
sharp
pangs
that
thou
inflictestâ€”speak
for
pity
does
aught
thou
knowest
concern
my
childâ€
â€œi
cannot
speakâ€
cried
frederic
bursting
from
her
â€œoh
matildaâ€
quitting
the
princess
thus
abruptly
he
hastened
to
his
own
apartment
at
the
door
of
it
he
was
accosted
by
manfred
who
flushed
by
wine
and
love
had
come
to
seek
him
and
to
propose
to
waste
some
hours
of
the
night
in
music
and
revelling
frederic
offended
at
an
invitation
so
dissonant
from
the
mood
of
his
soul
pushed
him
rudely
aside
and
entering
his
chamber
flung
the
door
intemperately
against
manfred
and
bolted
it
inwards
the
haughty
prince
enraged
at
this
unaccountable
behaviour
withdrew
in
a
frame
of
mind
capable
of
the
most
fatal
excesses
as
he
crossed
the
court
he
was
met
by
the
domestic
whom
he
had
planted
at
the
convent
as
a
spy
on
jerome
and
theodore
this
man
almost
breathless
with
the
haste
he
had
made
informed
his
lord
that
theodore
and
some
lady
from
the
castle
were
at
that
instant
in
private
conference
at
the
tomb
of
alfonso
in
st
nicholasâ€™s
church
he
had
dogged
theodore
thither
but
the
gloominess
of
the
night
had
prevented
his
discovering
who
the
woman
was
manfred
whose
spirits
were
inflamed
and
whom
isabella
had
driven
from
her
on
his
urging
his
passion
with
too
little
reserve
did
not
doubt
but
the
inquietude
she
had
expressed
had
been
occasioned
by
her
impatience
to
meet
theodore
provoked
by
this
conjecture
and
enraged
at
her
father
he
hastened
secretly
to
the
great
church
gliding
softly
between
the
aisles
and
guided
by
an
imperfect
gleam
of
moonshine
that
shone
faintly
through
the
illuminated
windows
he
stole
towards
the
tomb
of
alfonso
to
which
he
was
directed
by
indistinct
whispers
of
the
persons
he
sought
the
first
sounds
he
could
distinguish
wereâ€”
â€œdoes
it
alas
depend
on
me
manfred
will
never
permit
our
unionâ€
â€œno
this
shall
prevent
itâ€
cried
the
tyrant
drawing
his
dagger
and
plunging
it
over
her
shoulder
into
the
bosom
of
the
person
that
spoke
â€œah
me
i
am
slainâ€
cried
matilda
sinking
â€œgood
heaven
receive
my
soulâ€
â€œsavage
inhuman
monster
what
hast
thou
doneâ€
cried
theodore
rushing
on
him
and
wrenching
his
dagger
from
him
â€œstop
stop
thy
impious
handâ€
cried
matilda
â€œit
is
my
fatherâ€
manfred
waking
as
from
a
trance
beat
his
breast
twisted
his
hands
in
his
locks
and
endeavoured
to
recover
his
dagger
from
theodore
to
despatch
himself
theodore
scarce
less
distracted
and
only
mastering
the
transports
of
his
grief
to
assist
matilda
had
now
by
his
cries
drawn
some
of
the
monks
to
his
aid
while
part
of
them
endeavoured
in
concert
with
the
afflicted
theodore
to
stop
the
blood
of
the
dying
princess
the
rest
prevented
manfred
from
laying
violent
hands
on
himself
matilda
resigning
herself
patiently
to
her
fate
acknowledged
with
looks
of
grateful
love
the
zeal
of
theodore
yet
oft
as
her
faintness
would
permit
her
speech
its
way
she
begged
the
assistants
to
comfort
her
father
jerome
by
this
time
had
learnt
the
fatal
news
and
reached
the
church
his
looks
seemed
to
reproach
theodore
but
turning
to
manfred
he
said
â€œnow
tyrant
behold
the
completion
of
woe
fulfilled
on
thy
impious
and
devoted
head
the
blood
of
alfonso
cried
to
heaven
for
vengeance
and
heaven
has
permitted
its
altar
to
be
polluted
by
assassination
that
thou
mightest
shed
thy
own
blood
at
the
foot
of
that
princeâ€™s
sepulchreâ€
â€œcruel
manâ€
cried
matilda
â€œto
aggravate
the
woes
of
a
parent
may
heaven
bless
my
father
and
forgive
him
as
i
do
my
lord

gracious
sire
dost
thou
forgive
thy
child
indeed
i
came
not
hither
to
meet
theodore
i
found
him
praying
at
this
tomb
whither
my
mother
sent
me
to
intercede
for
thee
for
herâ€”dearest
father
bless
your
child
and
say
you
forgive
herâ€
â€œforgive
thee
murderous
monsterâ€
cried
manfred
â€œcan
assassins
forgive
i
took
thee
for
isabella
but
heaven
directed
my
bloody
hand
to
the
heart
of
my
child
oh
matildaâ€”i
cannot
utter
itâ€”canst
thou
forgive
the
blindness
of
my
rageâ€
â€œi
can
i
do
and
may
heaven
confirm
itâ€
said
matilda
â€œbut
while
i
have
life
to
ask
itâ€”oh
my

what
will
she
feel
will
you
comfort
her
my

will
you
not
put
her
away
indeed
she
loves
you
oh
i
am
faint
bear
me
to
the
castle
can
i
live
to
have
her
close
my
eyesâ€
theodore
and
the
monks
besought
her
earnestly
to
suffer
herself
to
be
borne
into
the
convent
but
her
instances
were
so
pressing
to
be
carried
to
the
castle
that
placing
her
on
a
litter
they
conveyed
her
thither
as
she
requested
theodore
supporting
her
head
with
his
arm
and
hanging
over
her
in
an
agony
of
despairing
love
still
endeavoured
to
inspire
her
with
hopes
of
life
jerome
on
the
other
side
comforted
her
with
discourses
of
heaven
and
holding
a
crucifix
before
her
which
she
bathed
with
innocent
tears
prepared
her
for
her
passage
to
immortality
manfred
plunged
in
the
deepest
affliction
followed
the
litter
in
despair
ere
they
reached
the
castle
hippolita
informed
of
the
dreadful
catastrophe
had
flown
to
meet
her
murdered
child
but
when
she
saw
the
afflicted
procession
the
mightiness
of
her
grief
deprived
her
of
her
senses
and
she
fell
lifeless
to
the
earth
in
a
swoon
isabella
and
frederic
who
attended
her
were
overwhelmed
in
almost
equal
sorrow
matilda
alone
seemed
insensible
to
her
own
situation
every
thought
was
lost
in
tenderness
for
her
mother
ordering
the
litter
to
stop
as
soon
as
hippolita
was
brought
to
herself
she
asked
for
her
father
he
approached
unable
to
speak
matilda
seizing
his
hand
and
her
motherâ€™s
locked
them
in
her
own
and
then
clasped
them
to
her
heart
manfred
could
not
support
this
act
of
pathetic
piety
he
dashed
himself
on
the
ground
and
cursed
the
day
he
was
born
isabella
apprehensive
that
these
struggles
of
passion
were
more
than
matilda
could
support
took
upon
herself
to
order
manfred
to
be
borne
to
his
apartment
while
she
caused
matilda
to
be
conveyed
to
the
nearest
chamber
hippolita
scarce
more
alive
than
her
daughter
was
regardless
of
everything
but
her
but
when
the
tender
isabellaâ€™s
care
would
have
likewise
removed
her
while
the
surgeons
examined
matildaâ€™s
wound
she
cried
â€œremove
me
never
never
i
lived
but
in
her
and
will
expire
with
herâ€
matilda
raised
her
eyes
at
her
motherâ€™s
voice
but
closed
them
again
without
speaking
her
sinking
pulse
and
the
damp
coldness
of
her
hand
soon
dispelled
all
hopes
of
recovery
theodore
followed
the
surgeons
into
the
outer
chamber
and
heard
them
pronounce
the
fatal
sentence
with
a
transport
equal
to
frenzy
â€œsince
she
cannot
live
mineâ€
cried
he
â€œat
least
she
shall
be
mine
in
death
father
jerome
will
you
not
join
our
handsâ€
cried
he
to
the
friar
who
with
the
marquis

in

â€œthose

manfred

by
sacrilegious
murder
has
forfeited

â€œmy
lordâ€
said
jerome
assuming
an
air
of
command
â€œhe
tells
you
true
it
was
not
my
purpose
the
secret
should
have
been
divulged
so
soon
but
fate
presses
onward
to
its
work
what
his
hot-headed
passion
has
revealed
my
tongue
confirms

prince
that
when
alfonso
set
sail
for
the
holy

â€œis
this
a
season
for
explanationsâ€
cried
theodore
â€œfather
come
and
unite
me
to
the
princess
she
shall
be
mine
in
every
other
thing
i
will
dutifully
obey

my

matildaâ€
continued
theodore
rushing
back
into
the
inner
chamber
â€œwill
you
not

mine
will
you
not
bless
yourâ€”â€
isabella
made
signs
to
him
to
be
silent
apprehending
the
princess
was
near
her
end
â€œwhat
is
she
deadâ€
cried
theodore
â€œis
it
possibleâ€
the
violence
of
his
exclamations
brought
matilda
to
herself
lifting
up
her
eyes
she
looked
round
for
her
mother
â€œlife
of
my
soul
i
am
hereâ€
cried
hippolita
â€œthink
not
i
will
quit
theeâ€
â€œoh
you
are
too
goodâ€
said
matilda
â€œbut
weep
not
for
me
my
mother
i
am
going
where
sorrow
never
dwellsâ€”isabella
thou
hast
loved
me
wouldst
thou
not
supply
my
fondness
to
this
dear
dear
woman
indeed
i
am
faintâ€
â€œoh
my
child
my
childâ€
said
hippolita
in
a
flood
of
tears
â€œcan
i
not
withhold
thee
a
momentâ€
â€œit
will
not
beâ€
said
matilda
â€œcommend
me
to
heavenâ€”where
is
my
father
forgive
him
dearest
motherâ€”forgive
him
my
death
it
was
an
error
oh
i
had
forgottenâ€”dearest
mother
i
vowed
never
to
see
theodore
moreâ€”perhaps
that
has
drawn
down
this
calamityâ€”but
it
was
not
intentionalâ€”can
you
pardon
meâ€
â€œoh
wound
not
my
agonising
soulâ€
said
hippolita
â€œthou
never
couldst
offend
meâ€”alas
she
faints
help
helpâ€
â€œi
would
say
something
moreâ€
said
matilda
struggling
â€œbut
it
cannot
beâ€”isabellaâ€”theodoreâ€”for
my
sakeâ€”ohâ€”â€
she
expired
isabella
and
her
women
tore
hippolita
from
the
corse
but
theodore
threatened
destruction
to
all
who
attempted
to
remove
him
from
it
he
printed
a
thousand
kisses
on
her
clay-cold
hands
and
uttered
every
expression
that
despairing
love
could
dictate
isabella
in
the
meantime
was
accompanying
the
afflicted
hippolita
to
her
apartment
but
in
the
middle
of
the
court
they
were
met
by
manfred
who
distracted
with
his
own
thoughts
and
anxious
once
more
to
behold
his
daughter
was
advancing
to
the
chamber
where
she
lay
as
the
moon
was
now
at
its
height
he
read
in
the
countenances
of
this
unhappy
company
the
event
he
dreaded
â€œwhat
is
she
deadâ€
cried
he
in
wild
confusion
a
clap
of
thunder
at
that
instant
shook
the
castle
to
its
foundations
the
earth
rocked
and
the
clank
of
more
than
mortal
armour
was
heard
behind
frederic
and
jerome
thought
the
last
day
was
at
hand
the
latter
forcing
theodore
along
with
them
rushed
into
the
court
the
moment
theodore
appeared
the
walls
of
the
castle
behind
manfred
were
thrown
down
with
a
mighty
force
and
the
form
of
alfonso
dilated
to
an
immense
magnitude
appeared
in
the
centre
of
the
ruins
â€œbehold
in
theodore
the
true
heir
of
alfonsoâ€
said
the
vision
and
having
pronounced
those
words
accompanied
by
a
clap
of
thunder
it
ascended
solemnly
towards
heaven
where
the
clouds
parting
asunder
the
form
of
st
nicholas
was
seen
and
receiving
alfonsoâ€™s
shade
they
were
soon
wrapt
from
mortal
eyes
in
a
blaze
of
glory
the
beholders
fell
prostrate
on
their
faces
acknowledging
the
divine
will
the
first
that
broke
silence
was
hippolita
â€œmy
lordâ€
said
she
to
the
desponding
manfred
â€œbehold
the
vanity
of
human
greatness
conrad
is
gone
matilda
is
no
more
in
theodore
we
view
the
true
prince
of
otranto
by
what
miracle
he
is
so
i
know
notâ€”suffice
it
to
us
our
doom
is
pronounced
shall
we
not
can
we
but
dedicate
the
few
deplorable
hours
we
have
to
live
in
deprecating
the
further
wrath
of
heaven
heaven
ejects
usâ€”whither
can
we
fly
but
to
yon
holy
cells
that
yet
offer
us
a
retreatâ€
â€œthou
guiltless
but
unhappy
woman
unhappy
by
my
crimesâ€
replied
manfred
â€œmy
heart
at
last
is
open
to
thy
devout
admonitions
oh
couldâ€”but
it
cannot
beâ€”ye
are
lost
in
wonderâ€”let
me
at
last
do
justice
on
myself
to
heap
shame
on
my
own
head
is
all
the
satisfaction
i
have
left
to
offer
to
offended
heaven
my
story
has
drawn
down
these
judgments
let
my
confession
atoneâ€”but
ah
what
can
atone
for
usurpation
and
a
murdered
child
a
child
murdered
in
a
consecrated
place
list
sirs
and
may
this
bloody
record
be
a
warning
to
future
tyrantsâ€
â€œalfonso
ye
all
know
died
in
the
holy
landâ€”ye
would
interrupt
me
ye
would
say
he
came
not
fairly
to
his
endâ€”it
is
most
trueâ€”why
else
this
bitter
cup
which
manfred
must
drink
to
the
dregs
ricardo
my
grandfather
was
his
chamberlainâ€”i
would
draw
a
veil
over
my
ancestorâ€™s
crimesâ€”but
it
is
in
vain
alfonso
died
by
poison
a
fictitious
will
declared
ricardo
his
heir
his
crimes
pursued
himâ€”yet
he
lost
no
conrad
no
matilda
i
pay
the
price
of
usurpation
for
all
a
storm
overtook
him
haunted
by
his
guilt
he
vowed
to
st
nicholas
to
found
a
church
and
two
convents
if
he
lived
to
reach
otranto
the
sacrifice
was
accepted
the
saint
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
and
promised
that
ricardoâ€™s
posterity
should
reign
in
otranto
until
the
rightful
owner
should
be
grown
too
large
to
inhabit
the
castle
and
as
long
as
issue
male
from
ricardoâ€™s
loins
should
remain
to
enjoy
itâ€”alas
alas
nor
male
nor
female
except
myself
remains
of
all
his
wretched
race
i
have
doneâ€”the
woes
of
these
three
days
speak
the
rest
how
this
young
man
can
be
alfonsoâ€™s
heir
i
know
notâ€”yet
i
do
not
doubt
it
his
are
these
dominions
i
resign
themâ€”yet
i
knew
not
alfonso
had
an
heirâ€”i
question
not
the
will
of
heavenâ€”poverty
and
prayer
must
fill
up
the
woeful
space
until
manfred
shall
be
summoned
to
ricardoâ€
â€œwhat
remains
is
my
part
to
declareâ€
said
jerome
â€œwhen
alfonso
set
sail
for
the
holy
land
he
was
driven
by
a
storm
to
the
coast
of
sicily
the
other
vessel
which
bore
ricardo
and
his
train
as
your
lordship
must
have
heard
was
separated
from
himâ€
â€œit
is
most
trueâ€
said
manfred
â€œand
the
title
you
give
me
is
more
than
an
outcast
can
claimâ€”well
be
it
soâ€”proceedâ€
jerome
blushed
and
continued
â€œfor
three
months
lord
alfonso
was
wind-bound
in
sicily
there
he
became
enamoured
of
a
fair
virgin
named
victoria
he
was
too
pious
to
tempt
her
to
forbidden
pleasures
they
were
married
yet
deeming
this
amour
incongruous
with
the
holy
vow
of
arms
by
which
he
was
bound
he
determined
to
conceal
their
nuptials
until
his
return
from
the
crusade
when
he
purposed
to
seek
and
acknowledge
her
for
his
lawful
wife
he
left
her
pregnant
during
his
absence
she
was
delivered
of
a
daughter
but
scarce
had
she
felt
a
motherâ€™s
pangs
ere
she
heard
the
fatal
rumour
of
her
lordâ€™s
death
and
the
succession
of
ricardo
what
could
a
friendless
helpless
woman
do
would
her
testimony
availâ€”yet
my
lord
i
have
an
authentic
writingâ€”â€
â€œit
needs
notâ€
said
manfred
â€œthe
horrors
of
these
days
the
vision
we
have
but
now
seen
all
corroborate
thy
evidence
beyond
a
thousand
parchments

death
and

expulsionâ€”â€
â€œbe
composed
my
lordâ€
said
hippolita
â€œthis
holy
man
did
not
mean
to
recall
your
griefsâ€
jerome
proceeded
â€œi
shall
not
dwell
on
what
is
needless
the
daughter
of
which
victoria
was
delivered
was
at
her
maturity
bestowed
in
marriage
on
me
victoria
died
and
the
secret
remained
locked

the

ceased
the
disconsolate
company
retired
to
the
remaining
part
of
the
castle
in
the
morning
manfred
signed
his
abdication
of
the
principality
with
the
approbation
of
hippolita
and
each
took
on
them
the
habit
of
religion
in
the
neighbouring
convents
frederic
offered
his
daughter
to
the
new
prince
which
hippolitaâ€™s
tenderness
for
isabella
concurred
to
promote
but
theodoreâ€™s
grief
was
too
fresh
to
admit
the
thought
of
another
love
and
it
was
not
until
after
frequent
discourses
with
isabella
of
his
dear
matilda
that
he
was
persuaded
he
could
know
no
happiness
but
in
the
society
of
one
with
whom
he
could
for
ever
indulge

melancholy
that
had
