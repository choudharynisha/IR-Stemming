and
what
is
it
makes
you
think
i
could
be
of
use
in
this
particular
case
asked
dr
john
silence
looking
across
somewhat
sceptically
at
the
swedish
lady
in
the
chair
facing
him
your
sympathetic
heart
and
your
knowledge
of
occultism--
oh
please--that
dreadful
word
he
interrupted
holding
up
a
finger
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
well
then
she
laughed
your
wonderful
clairvoyant
gift
and
your
trained
psychic
knowledge
of
the
processes
by
which
a
personality
may
be
disintegrated
and
destroyed--these
strange
studies
you've
been
experimenting
with
all
these
years--
if
it's
only
a
case
of
multiple
personality
i
must
really
cry
off
interrupted
the
doctor
again
hastily
a
bored
expression
in
his
eyes
it's
not
that
now
please
be
serious
for
i
want
your
help
she
said
and
if
i
choose
my
words
poorly
you
must
be
patient
with
my
ignorance
the
case
i
know
will
interest
you
and
no
one
else
could
deal
with
it
so
well
in
fact
no
ordinary
professional
man
could
deal
with
it
at
all
for
i
know
of
no
treatment
nor
medicine
that
can
restore
a
lost
sense
of
humour
you
begin
to
interest
me
with
your
'case'
he
replied
and
made
himself
comfortable
to
listen
mrs
sivendson
drew
a
sigh
of
contentment
as
she
watched
him
go
to
the
tube
and
heard
him
tell
the
servant
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
i
believe
you
have
read
my
thoughts
already
she
said
your
intuitive
knowledge
of
what
goes
on
in
other
people's
minds
is
positively
uncanny
her
friend
shook
his
head
and
smiled
as
he
drew
his
chair
up
to
a
convenient
position
and
prepared
to
listen
attentively
to
what
she
had
to
say
he
closed
his
eyes
as
he
always
did
when
he
wished
to
absorb
the
real
meaning
of
a
recital
that
might
be
inadequately
expressed
for
by
this
method
he
found
it
easier
to
set
himself
in
tune
with
the
living
thoughts
that
lay
behind
the
broken
words
by
his
friends
john
silence
was
regarded
as
an
eccentric
because
he
was
rich
by
accident
and
by
choice--a
doctor
that
a
man
of
independent
means
should
devote
his
time
to
doctoring
chiefly
doctoring
folk
who
could
not
pay
passed
their
comprehension
entirely
the
native
nobility
of
a
soul
whose
first
desire
was
to
help
those
who
could
not
help
themselves
puzzled
them
after
that
it
irritated
them
and
greatly
to
his
own
satisfaction
they
left
him
to
his
own
devices
dr
silence
was
a
free-lance
though
among
doctors
having
neither
consulting-room
bookkeeper
nor
professional
manner
he
took
no
fees
being
at
heart
a
genuine
philanthropist
yet
at
the
same
time
did
no
harm
to
his
fellow-practitioners
because
he
only
accepted
unremunerative
cases
and
cases
that
interested
him
for
some
very
special
reason
he
argued
that
the
rich
could
pay
and
the
very
poor
could
avail
themselves
of
organised
charity
but
that
a
very
large
class
of
ill-paid
self-respecting
workers
often
followers
of
the
arts
could
not
afford
the
price
of
a
week's
comforts
merely
to
be
told
to
travel
and
it
was
these
he
desired
to
help
cases
often
requiring
special
and
patient
study--things
no
doctor
can
give
for
a
guinea
and
that
no
one
would
dream
of
expecting
him
to
give
but
there
was
another
side
to
his
personality
and
practice
and
one
with
which
we
are
now
more
directly
concerned
for
the
cases
that
especially
appealed
to
him
were
of
no
ordinary
kind
but
rather
of
that
intangible
elusive
and
difficult
nature
best
described
as
psychical
afflictions
and
though
he
would
have
been
the
last
person
himself
to
approve
of
the
title
it
was
beyond
question
that
he
was
known
more
or
less
generally
as
the
psychic
doctor
in
order
to
grapple
with
cases
of
this
peculiar
kind
he
had
submitted
himself
to
a
long
and
severe
training
at
once
physical
mental
and
spiritual
what
precisely
this
training
had
been
or
where
undergone
no
one
seemed
to
know--for
he
never
spoke
of
it
as
indeed
he
betrayed
no
single
other
characteristic
of
the
charlatan--but
the
fact
that
it
had
involved
a
total
disappearance
from
the
world
for
five
years
and
that
after
he
returned
and
began
his
singular
practice
no
one
ever
dreamed
of
applying
to
him
the
so
easily
acquired
epithet
of
quack
spoke
much
for
the
seriousness
of
his
strange
quest
and
also
for
the
genuineness
of
his
attainments
for
the
modern
psychical
researcher
he
felt
the
calm
tolerance
of
the
man
who
knows
there
was
a
trace
of
pity
in
his
voice--contempt
he
never
showed--when
he
spoke
of
their
methods
this
classification
of
results
is
uninspired
work
at
best
he
said
once
to
me
when
i
had
been
his
confidential
assistant
for
some
years
it
leads
nowhere
and
after
a
hundred
years
will
lead
nowhere
it
is
playing
with
the
wrong
end
of
a
rather
dangerous
toy
far
better
it
would
be
to
examine
the
causes
and
then
the
results
would
so
easily
slip
into
place
and
explain
themselves
for
the
sources
are
accessible
and
open
to
all
who
have
the
courage
to
lead
the
life
that
alone
makes
practical
investigation
safe
and
possible
and
towards
the
question
of
clairvoyance
too
his
attitude
was
significantly
sane
for
he
knew
how
extremely
rare
the
genuine
power
was
and
that
what
is
commonly
called
clairvoyance
is
nothing
more
than
a
keen
power
of
visualising
it
connotes
a
slightly
increased
sensibility
nothing
more
he
would
say
the
true
clairvoyant
deplores
his
power
recognising
that
it
adds
a
new
horror
to
life
and
is
in
the
nature
of
an
affliction
and
you
will
find
this
always
to
be
the
real
test
thus
it
was
that
john
silence
this
singularly
developed
doctor
was
able
to
select
his
cases
with
a
clear
knowledge
of
the
difference
between
mere
hysterical
delusion
and
the
kind
of
psychical
affliction
that
claimed
his
special
powers
it
was
never
necessary
for
him
to
resort
to
the
cheap
mysteries
of
divination
for
as
i
have
heard
him
observe
after
the
solution
of
some
peculiarly
intricate
problem--
systems
of
divination
from
geomancy
down
to
reading
by
tea-leaves
are
merely
so
many
methods
of
obscuring
the
outer
vision
in
order
that
the
inner
vision
may
become
open
once
the
method
is
mastered
no
system
is
necessary
at
all
and
the
words
were
significant
of
the
methods
of
this
remarkable
man
the
keynote
of
whose
power
lay
perhaps
more
than
anything
else
in
the
knowledge
first
that
thought
can
act
at
a
distance
and
secondly
that
thought
is
dynamic
and
can
accomplish
material
results
learn
how
to
think
he
would
have
expressed
it
and
you
have
learned
to
tap
power
at
its
source
to
look
at--he
was
now
past
forty--he
was
sparely
built
with
speaking
brown
eyes
in
which
shone
the
light
of
knowledge
and
self-confidence
while
at
the
same
time
they
made
one
think
of
that
wondrous
gentleness
seen
most
often
in
the
eyes
of
animals
a
close
beard
concealed
the
mouth
without
disguising
the
grim
determination
of
lips
and
jaw
and
the
face
somehow
conveyed
an
impression
of
transparency
almost
of
light
so
delicately
were
the
features
refined
away
on
the
fine
forehead
was
that
indefinable
touch
of
peace
that
comes
from
identifying
the
mind
with
what
is
permanent
in
the
soul
and
letting
the
impermanent
slip
by
without
power
to
wound
or
distress
while
from
his
manner--so
gentle
quiet
sympathetic--few
could
have
guessed
the
strength
of
purpose
that
burned
within
like
a
great
flame
i
think
i
should
describe
it
as
a
psychical
case
continued
the
swedish
lady
obviously
trying
to
explain
herself
very
intelligently
and
just
the
kind
you
like
i
mean
a
case
where
the
cause
is
hidden
deep
down
in
some
spiritual
distress
and--
but
the
symptoms
first
please
my
dear
svenska
he
interrupted
with
a
strangely
compelling
seriousness
of
manner
and
your
deductions
afterwards
she
turned
round
sharply
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
and
looked
him
in
the
face
lowering
her
voice
to
prevent
her
emotion
betraying
itself
too
obviously
in
my
opinion
there's
only
one
symptom
she
half
whispered
as
though
telling
something
disagreeable--fear--simply
fear
physical
fear
i
think
not
though
how
can
i
say
i
think
it's
a
horror
in
the
psychical
region
it's
no
ordinary
delusion
the
man
is
quite
sane
but
he
lives
in
mortal
terror
of
something--
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
his
'psychical
region'
said
the
doctor
with
a
smile
though
i
suppose
you
wish
me
to
understand
that
his
spiritual
and
not
his
mental
processes
are
affected
anyhow
try
and
tell
me
briefly
and
pointedly
what
you
know
about
the
man
his
symptoms
his
need
for
help
my
peculiar
help
that
is
and
all
that
seems
vital
in
the
case
i
promise
to
listen
devotedly
i
am
trying
she
continued
earnestly
but
must
do
so
in
my
own
words
and
trust
to
your
intelligence
to
disentangle
as
i
go
along
he
is
a
young
author
and
lives
in
a
tiny
house
off
putney
heath
somewhere
he
writes
humorous
stories--quite
a
genre
of
his
own
pender--you
must
have
heard
the
name--felix
pender
oh
the
man
had
a
great
gift
and
married
on
the
strength
of
it
his
future
seemed
assured
i
say
'had'
for
quite
suddenly
his
talent
utterly
failed
him
worse
it
became
transformed
into
its
opposite
he
can
no
longer
write
a
line
in
the
old
way
that
was
bringing
him
success--
dr
silence
opened
his
eyes
for
a
second
and
looked
at
her
he
still
writes
then
the
force
has
not
gone
he
asked
briefly
and
then
closed
his
eyes
again
to
listen
he
works
like
a
fury
she
went
on
but
produces
nothing--she
hesitated
a
moment--nothing
that
he
can
use
or
sell
his
earnings
have
practically
ceased
and
he
makes
a
precarious
living
by
book-reviewing
and
odd
jobs--very
odd
some
of
them
yet
i
am
certain
his
talent
has
not
really
deserted
him
finally
but
is
merely--
again
mrs
sivendson
hesitated
for
the
appropriate
word
in
abeyance
he
suggested
without
opening
his
eyes
obliterated
she
went
on
after
a
moment
to
weigh
the
word
merely
obliterated
by
something
else--
by
some
one
else
i
wish
i
knew
all
i
can
say
is
that
he
is
haunted
and
temporarily
his
sense
of
humour
is
shrouded--gone--replaced
by
something
dreadful
that
writes
other
things
unless
something
competent
is
done
he
will
simply
starve
to
death
yet
he
is
afraid
to
go
to
a
doctor
for
fear
of
being
pronounced
insane
and
anyhow
a
man
can
hardly
ask
a
doctor
to
take
a
guinea
to
restore
a
vanished
sense
of
humour
can
he
has
he
tried
any
one
at
all--
not
doctors
yet
he
tried
some
clergymen
and
religious
people
but
they
know
so
little
and
have
so
little
intelligent
sympathy
and
most
of
them
are
so
busy
balancing
on
their
own
little
pedestals--
john
silence
stopped
her
tirade
with
a
gesture
and
how
is
it
that
you
know
so
much
about
him
he
asked
gently
i
know
mrs
pender
well--i
knew
her
before
she
married
him--
and
is
she
a
cause
perhaps
not
in
the
least
she
is
devoted
a
woman
very
well
educated
though
without
being
really
intelligent
and
with
so
little
sense
of
humour
herself
that
she
always
laughs
at
the
wrong
places
but
she
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
cause
of
his
distress
and
indeed
has
chiefly
guessed
it
from
observing
him
rather
than
from
what
little
he
has
told
her
and
he
you
know
is
a
really
lovable
fellow
hard-working
patient--altogether
worth
saving
dr
silence
opened
his
eyes
and
went
over
to
ring
for
tea
he
did
not
know
very
much
more
about
the
case
of
the
humorist
than
when
he
first
sat
down
to
listen
but
he
realised
that
no
amount
of
words
from
his
swedish
friend
would
help
to
reveal
the
real
facts
a
personal
interview
with
the
author
himself
could
alone
do
that
all
humorists
are
worth
saving
he
said
with
a
smile
as
she
poured
out
tea
we
can't
afford
to
lose
a
single
one
in
these
strenuous
days
i
will
go
and
see
your
friend
at
the
first
opportunity
she
thanked
him
elaborately
effusively
with
many
words
and
he
with
much
difficulty
kept
the
conversation
thenceforward
strictly
to
the
teapot
and
as
a
result
of
this
conversation
and
a
little
more
he
had
gathered
by
means
best
known
to
himself
and
his
secretary
he
was
whizzing
in
his
motor-car
one
afternoon
a
few
days
later
up
the
putney
hill
to
have
his
first
interview
with
felix
pender
the
humorous
writer
who
was
the
victim
of
some
mysterious
malady
in
his
psychical
region
that
had
obliterated
his
sense
of
the
comic
and
threatened
to
wreck
his
life
and
destroy
his
talent
and
his
desire
to
help
was
probably
of
equal
strength
with
his
desire
to
know
and
to
investigate
the
motor
stopped
with
a
deep
purring
sound
as
though
a
great
black
panther
lay
concealed
within
its
hood
and
the
doctor--the
psychic
doctor
as
he
was
sometimes
called--stepped
out
through
the
gathering
fog
and
walked
across
the
tiny
garden
that
held
a
blackened
fir
tree
and
a
stunted
laurel
shrubbery
the
house
was
very
small
and
it
was
some
time
before
any
one
answered
the
bell
then
suddenly
a
light
appeared
in
the
hall
and
he
saw
a
pretty
little
woman
standing
on
the
top
step
begging
him
to
come
in
she
was
dressed
in
grey
and
the
gaslight
fell
on
a
mass
of
deliberately
brushed
light
hair
stuffed
dusty
birds
and
a
shabby
array
of
african
spears
hung
on
the
wall
behind
her
a
hat-rack
with
a
bronze
plate
full
of
very
large
cards
led
his
eye
swiftly
to
a
dark
staircase
beyond
mrs
pender
had
round
eyes
like
a
child's
and
she
greeted
him
with
an
effusiveness
that
barely
concealed
her
emotion
yet
strove
to
appear
naturally
cordial
evidently
she
had
been
looking
out
for
his
arrival
and
had
outrun
the
servant
girl
she
was
a
little
breathless
i
hope
you've
not
been
kept
waiting--i
think
it's
most
good
of
you
to
come--
she
began
and
then
stopped
sharp
when
she
saw
his
face
in
the
gaslight
there
was
something
in
dr
silence's
look
that
did
not
encourage
mere
talk
he
was
in
earnest
now
if
ever
man
was
good
evening
mrs
pender
he
said
with
a
quiet
smile
that
won
confidence
yet
deprecated
unnecessary
words
the
fog
delayed
me
a
little
i
am
glad
to
see
you
they
went
into
a
dingy
sitting-room
at
the
back
of
the
house
neatly
furnished
but
depressing
books
stood
in
a
row
upon
the
mantelpiece
the
fire
had
evidently
just
been
lit
it
smoked
in
great
puffs
into
the
room
mrs
sivendson
said
she
thought
you
might
be
able
to
come
ventured
the
little
woman
again
looking
up
engagingly
into
his
face
and
betraying
anxiety
and
eagerness
in
every
gesture
but
i
hardly
dared
to
believe
it
i
think
it
is
really
too
good
of
you
my
husband's
case
is
so
peculiar
that--well
you
know
i
am
quite
sure
any
ordinary
doctor
would
say
at
once
the
asylum--
isn't
he
in
then
asked
dr
silence
gently
in
the
asylum
she
gasped
oh
dear
no--not
yet
in
the
house
i
meant
he
laughed
she
gave
a
great
sigh
he'll
be
back
any
minute
now
she
replied
obviously
relieved
to
see
him
laugh
but
the
fact
is
we
didn't
expect
you
so
early--i
mean
my
husband
hardly
thought
you
would
come
at
all
i
am
always
delighted
to
come--when
i
am
really
wanted
and
can
be
of
help
he
said
quickly
and
perhaps
it's
all
for
the
best
that
your
husband
is
out
for
now
that
we
are
alone
you
can
tell
me
something
about
his
difficulties
so
far
you
know
i
have
heard
very
little
her
voice
trembled
as
she
thanked
him
and
when
he
came
and
took
a
chair
close
beside
her
she
actually
had
difficulty
in
finding
words
with
which
to
begin
in
the
first
place
she
began
timidly
and
then
continuing
with
a
nervous
incoherent
rush
of
words
he
will
be
simply
delighted
that
you've
really
come
because
he
said
you
were
the
only
person
he
would
consent
to
see
at
all--the
only
doctor
i
mean
but
of
course
he
doesn't
know
how
frightened
i
am
or
how
much
i
have
noticed
he
pretends
with
me
that
it's
just
a
nervous
breakdown
and
i'm
sure
he
doesn't
realise
all
the
odd
things
i've
noticed
him
doing
but
the
main
thing
i
suppose--
yes
the
main
thing
mrs
pender
he
said
encouragingly
noticing
her
hesitation
--is
that
he
thinks
we
are
not
alone
in
the
house
that's
the
chief
thing
tell
me
more
facts--just
facts
it
began
last
summer
when
i
came
back
from
ireland
he
had
been
here
alone
for
six
weeks
and
i
thought
him
looking
tired
and
queer--ragged
and
scattered
about
the
face
if
you
know
what
i
mean
and
his
manner
worn
out
he
said
he
had
been
writing
hard
but
his
inspiration
had
somehow
failed
him
and
he
was
dissatisfied
with
his
work
his
sense
of
humour
was
leaving
him
or
changing
into
something
else
he
said
there
was
something
in
the
house
he
declared
that--she
emphasised
the
words--prevented
his
feeling
funny
something
in
the
house
that
prevented
his
feeling
funny
repeated
the
doctor
ah
now
we're
getting
to
the
heart
of
it
yes
she
resumed
vaguely
that's
what
he
kept
saying
and
what
was
it
he
did
that
you
thought
strange
he
asked
sympathetically
be
brief
or
he
may
be
here
before
you
finish
very
small
things
but
significant
it
seemed
to
me
he
changed
his
workroom
from
the
library
as
we
call
it
to
the
sitting-room
he
said
all
his
characters
became
wrong
and
terrible
in
the
library
they
altered
so
that
he
felt
like
writing
tragedies--vile
debased
tragedies
the
tragedies
of
broken
souls
but
now
he
says
the
same
of
the
sitting-room
and
he's
gone
back
to
the
library
ah
you
see
there's
so
little
i
can
tell
you
she
went
on
with
increasing
speed
and
countless
gestures
i
mean
it's
only
very
small
things
he
does
and
says
that
are
queer
what
frightens
me
is
that
he
assumes
there
is
some
one
else
in
the
house
all
the
time--some
one
i
never
see
he
does
not
actually
say
so
but
on
the
stairs
i've
seen
him
standing
aside
to
let
some
one
pass
i've
seen
him
open
a
door
to
let
some
one
in
or
out
and
often
in
our
bedrooms
he
puts
chairs
about
as
though
for
some
one
else
to
sit
in
oh--oh
yes
and
once
or
twice
she
cried--once
or
twice--
she
paused
and
looked
about
her
with
a
startled
air
yes
once
or
twice
she
resumed
hurriedly
as
though
she
heard
a
sound
that
alarmed
her
i've
heard
him
running--coming
in
and
out
of
the
rooms
breathless
as
if
something
were
after
him--
the
door
opened
while
she
was
still
speaking
cutting
her
words
off
in
the
middle
and
a
man
came
into
the
room
he
was
dark
and
clean-shaven
sallow
rather
with
the
eyes
of
imagination
and
dark
hair
growing
scantily
about
the
temples
he
was
dressed
in
a
shabby
tweed
suit
and
wore
an
untidy
flannel
collar
at
the
neck
the
dominant
expression
of
his
face
was
startled--hunted
an
expression
that
might
any
moment
leap
into
the
dreadful
stare
of
terror
and
announce
a
total
loss
of
self-control
the
moment
he
saw
his
visitor
a
smile
spread
over
his
worn
features
and
he
advanced
to
shake
hands
i
hoped
you
would
come
mrs
sivendson
said
you
might
be
able
to
find
time
he
said
simply
his
voice
was
thin
and
needy
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
dr
silence
it
is
'doctor'
is
it
not
well
i
am
entitled
to
the
description
laughed
the
other
but
i
rarely
get
it
you
know
i
do
not
practise
as
a
regular
thing
that
is
i
only
take
cases
that
specially
interest
me
or--
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
for
the
men
exchanged
a
glance
of
sympathy
that
rendered
it
unnecessary
i
have
heard
of
your
great
kindness
it's
my
hobby
said
the
other
quickly
and
my
privilege
i
trust
you
will
still
think
so
when
you
have
heard
what
i
have
to
tell
you
continued
the
author
a
little
wearily
he
led
the
way
across
the
hall
into
the
little
smoking-room
where
they
could
talk
freely
and
undisturbed
in
the
smoking-room
the
door
shut
and
privacy
about
them
fender's
attitude
changed
somewhat
and
his
manner
became
very
grave
the
doctor
sat
opposite
where
he
could
watch
his
face
already
he
saw
it
looked
more
haggard
evidently
it
cost
him
much
to
refer
to
his
trouble
at
all
what
i
have
is
in
my
belief
a
profound
spiritual
affliction
he
began
quite
bluntly
looking
straight
into
the
other's
eyes
i
saw
that
at
once
dr
silence
said
yes
you
saw
that
of
course
my
atmosphere
must
convey
that
much
to
any
one
with
psychic
perceptions
besides
which
i
feel
sure
from
all
i've
heard
that
you
are
really
a
soul-doctor
are
you
not
more
than
a
healer
merely
of
the
body
you
think
of
me
too
highly
returned
the
other
though
i
prefer
cases
as
you
know
in
which
the
spirit
is
disturbed
first
the
body
afterwards
i
understand
yes
well
i
have
experienced
a
curious
disturbance
in--not
in
my
physical
region
primarily
i
mean
my
nerves
are
all
right
and
my
body
is
all
right
i
have
no
delusions
exactly
but
my
spirit
is
tortured
by
a
calamitous
fear
which
first
came
upon
me
in
a
strange
manner
john
silence
leaned
forward
a
moment
and
took
the
speaker's
hand
and
held
it
in
his
own
for
a
few
brief
seconds
closing
his
eyes
as
he
did
so
he
was
not
feeling
his
pulse
or
doing
any
of
the
things
that
doctors
ordinarily
do
he
was
merely
absorbing
into
himself
the
main
note
of
the
man's
mental
condition
so
as
to
get
completely
his
own
point
of
view
and
thus
be
able
to
treat
his
case
with
true
sympathy
a
very
close
observer
might
perhaps
have
noticed
that
a
slight
tremor
ran
through
his
frame
after
he
had
held
the
hand
for
a
few
seconds
tell
me
quite
frankly
mr
pender
he
said
soothingly
releasing
the
hand
and
with
deep
attention
in
his
manner
tell
me
all
the
steps
that
led
to
the
beginning
of
this
invasion
i
mean
tell
me
what
the
particular
drug
was
and
why
you
took
it
and
how
it
affected
you--
then
you
know
it
began
with
a
drug
cried
the
author
with
undisguised
astonishment
i
only
know
from
what
i
observe
in
you
and
in
its
effect
upon
myself
you
are
in
a
surprising
psychical
condition
certain
portions
of
your
atmosphere
are
vibrating
at
a
far
greater
rate
than
others
this
is
the
effect
of
a
drug
but
of
no
ordinary
drug
allow
me
to
finish
please
if
the
higher
rate
of
vibration
spreads
all
over
you
will
become
of
course
permanently
cognisant
of
a
much
larger
world
than
the
one
you
know
normally
if
on
the
other
hand
the
rapid
portion
sinks
back
to
the
usual
rate
you
will
lose
these
occasional
increased
perceptions
you
now
have
you
amaze
me
exclaimed
the
author
for
your
words
exactly
describe
what
i
have
been
feeling--
i
mention
this
only
in
passing
and
to
give
you
confidence
before
you
approach
the
account
of
your
real
affliction
continued
the
doctor
all
perception
as
you
know
is
the
result
of
vibrations
and
clairvoyance
simply
means
becoming
sensitive
to
an
increased
scale
of
vibrations
the
awakening
of
the
inner
senses
we
hear
so
much
about
means
no
more
than
that
your
partial
clairvoyance
is
easily
explained
the
only
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
how
you
managed
to
procure
the
drug
for
it
is
not
easy
to
get
in
pure
form
and
no
adulterated
tincture
could
have
given
you
the
terrific
impetus
i
see
you
have
acquired
but
please
proceed
now
and
tell
me
your
story
in
your
own
way
this
cannabis
indica
the
author
went
on
came
into
my
possession
last
autumn
while
my
wife
was
away
i
need
not
explain
how
i
got
it
for
that
has
no
importance
but
it
was
the
genuine
fluid
extract
and
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
make
an
experiment
one
of
its
effects
as
you
know
is
to
induce
torrential
laughter--
yes
sometimes
--i
am
a
writer
of
humorous
tales
and
i
wished
to
increase
my
own
sense
of
laughter--to
see
the
ludicrous
from
an
abnormal
point
of
view
i
wished
to
study
it
a
bit
if
possible
and--
tell
me
i
took
an
experimental
dose
i
starved
for
six
hours
to
hasten
the
effect
locked
myself
into
this
room
and
gave
orders
not
to
be
disturbed
then
i
swallowed
the
stuff
and
waited
and
the
effect
i
waited
one
hour
two
three
four
five
hours
nothing
happened
no
laughter
came
but
only
a
great
weariness
instead
nothing
in
the
room
or
in
my
thoughts
came
within
a
hundred
miles
of
a
humorous
aspect
always
a
most
uncertain
drug
interrupted
the
doctor
we
make
very
small
use
of
it
on
that
account
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
i
felt
so
hungry
and
tired
that
i
decided
to
give
up
the
experiment
and
wait
no
longer
i
drank
some
milk
and
went
upstairs
to
bed
i
felt
flat
and
disappointed
i
fell
asleep
at
once
and
must
have
slept
for
about
an
hour
when
i
awoke
suddenly
with
a
great
noise
in
my
ears
it
was
the
noise
of
my
own
laughter
i
was
simply
shaking
with
merriment
at
first
i
was
bewildered
and
thought
i
had
been
laughing
in
dreams
but
a
moment
later
i
remembered
the
drug
and
was
delighted
to
think
that
after
all
i
had
got
an
effect
it
had
been
working
all
along
only
i
had
miscalculated
the
time
the
only
unpleasant
thing
then
was
an
odd
feeling
that
i
had
not
waked
naturally
but
had
been
wakened
by
some
one
else--deliberately
this
came
to
me
as
a
certainty
in
the
middle
of
my
noisy
laughter
and
distressed
me
any
impression
who
it
could
have
been
asked
the
doctor
now
listening
with
close
attention
to
every
word
very
much
on
the
alert
pender
hesitated
and
tried
to
smile
he
brushed
his
hair
from
his
forehead
with
a
nervous
gesture
you
must
tell
me
all
your
impressions
even
your
fancies
they
are
quite
as
important
as
your
certainties
i
had
a
vague
idea
that
it
was
some
one
connected
with
my
forgotten
dream
some
one
who
had
been
at
me
in
my
sleep
some
one
of
great
strength
and
great
ability--of
great
force--quite
an
unusual
personality--and
i
was
certain
too--a
woman
a
good
woman
asked
john
silence
quietly
pender
started
a
little
at
the
question
and
his
sallow
face
flushed
it
seemed
to
surprise
him
but
he
shook
his
head
quickly
with
an
indefinable
look
of
horror
evil
he
answered
briefly
appallingly
evil
and
yet
mingled
with
the
sheer
wickedness
of
it
was
also
a
certain
perverseness--the
perversity
of
the
unbalanced
mind
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
looked
up
sharply
at
his
interlocutor
a
shade
of
suspicion
showed
itself
in
his
eyes
no
laughed
the
doctor
you
need
not
fear
that
i'm
merely
humouring
you
or
think
you
mad
far
from
it
your
story
interests
me
exceedingly
and
you
furnish
me
unconsciously
with
a
number
of
clues
as
you
tell
it
you
see
i
possess
some
knowledge
of
my
own
as
to
these
psychic
byways
i
was
shaking
with
such
violent
laughter
continued
the
narrator
reassured
in
a
moment
though
with
no
clear
idea
what
was
amusing
me
that
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
getting
up
for
the
matches
and
was
afraid
i
should
frighten
the
servants
overhead
with
my
explosions
when
the
gas
was
lit
i
found
the
room
empty
of
course
and
the
door
locked
as
usual
then
i
half
dressed
and
went
out
on
to
the
landing
my
hilarity
better
under
control
and
proceeded
to
go
downstairs
i
wished
to
record
my
sensations
i
stuffed
a
handkerchief
into
my
mouth
so
as
not
to
scream
aloud
and
communicate
my
hysterics
to
the
entire
household
and
the
presence
of
this--this--
it
was
hanging
about
me
all
the
time
said
pender
but
for
the
moment
it
seemed
to
have
withdrawn
probably
too
my
laughter
killed
all
other
emotions
and
how
long
did
you
take
getting
downstairs
i
was
just
coming
to
that
i
see
you
know
all
my
'symptoms'
in
advance
as
it
were
for
of
course
i
thought
i
should
never
get
to
the
bottom
each
step
seemed
to
take
five
minutes
and
crossing
the
narrow
hall
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs--well
i
could
have
sworn
it
was
half
an
hour's
journey
had
not
my
watch
certified
that
it
was
a
few
seconds
yet
i
walked
fast
and
tried
to
push
on
it
was
no
good
i
walked
apparently
without
advancing
and
at
that
rate
it
would
have
taken
me
a
week
to
get
down
putney
hill
an
experimental
dose
radically
alters
the
scale
of
time
and
space
sometimes--
but
when
at
last
i
got
into
my
study
and
lit
the
gas
the
change
came
horridly
and
sudden
as
a
flash
of
lightning
it
was
like
a
douche
of
icy
water
and
in
the
middle
of
this
storm
of
laughter--
yes
what
asked
the
doctor
leaning
forward
and
peering
into
his
eyes
--i
was
overwhelmed
with
terror
said
pender
lowering
his
reedy
voice
at
the
mere
recollection
of
it
he
paused
a
moment
and
mopped
his
forehead
the
scared
hunted
look
in
his
eyes
now
dominated
the
whole
face
yet
all
the
time
the
corners
of
his
mouth
hinted
of
possible
laughter
as
though
the
recollection
of
that
merriment
still
amused
him
the
combination
of
fear
and
laughter
in
his
face
was
very
curious
and
lent
great
conviction
to
his
story
it
also
lent
a
bizarre
expression
of
horror
to
his
gestures
terror
was
it
repeated
the
doctor
soothingly
yes
terror
for
though
the
thing
that
woke
me
seemed
to
have
gone
the
memory
of
it
still
frightened
me
and
i
collapsed
into
a
chair
then
i
locked
the
door
and
tried
to
reason
with
myself
but
the
drug
made
my
movements
so
prolonged
that
it
took
me
five
minutes
to
reach
the
door
and
another
five
to
get
back
to
the
chair
again
the
laughter
too
kept
bubbling
up
inside
me--great
wholesome
laughter
that
shook
me
like
gusts
of
wind--so
that
even
my
terror
almost
made
me
laugh
oh
but
i
may
tell
you
dr
silence
it
was
altogether
vile
that
mixture
of
fear
and
laughter
altogether
vile
then
all
at
once
the
things
in
the
room
again
presented
their
funny
side
to
me
and
set
me
off
laughing
more
furiously
than
ever
the
bookcase
was
ludicrous
the
arm-chair
a
perfect
clown
the
way
the
clock
looked
at
me
on
the
mantelpiece
too
comic
for
words
the
arrangement
of
papers
and
inkstand
on
the
desk
tickled
me
till
i
roared
and
shook
and
held
my
sides
and
the
tears
streamed
down
my
cheeks
and
that
footstool
oh
that
absurd
footstool
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
laughing
to
himself
and
holding
up
his
hands
at
the
thought
of
it
and
at
the
sight
of
him
dr
silence
laughed
too
go
on
please
he
said
i
quite
understand
i
know
something
myself
of
the
hashish
laughter
the
author
pulled
himself
together
and
resumed
his
face
growing
quickly
grave
again
so
you
see
side
by
side
with
this
extravagant
apparently
causeless
merriment
there
was
also
an
extravagant
apparently
causeless
terror
the
drug
produced
the
laughter
i
knew
but
what
brought
in
the
terror
i
could
not
imagine
everywhere
behind
the
fun
lay
the
fear
it
was
terror
masked
by
cap
and
bells
and
i
became
the
playground
for
two
opposing
emotions
armed
and
fighting
to
the
death
gradually
then
the
impression
grew
in
me
that
this
fear
was
caused
by
the
invasion--so
you
called
it
just
now--of
the
'person'
who
had
wakened
me
she
was
utterly
evil
inimical
to
my
soul
or
at
least
to
all
in
me
that
wished
for
good
there
i
stood
sweating
and
trembling
laughing
at
everything
in
the
room
yet
all
the
while
with
this
white
terror
mastering
my
heart
and
this
creature
was
putting--putting
her--
he
hesitated
again
using
his
handkerchief
freely
putting
what
--putting
ideas
into
my
mind
he
went
on
glancing
nervously
about
the
room
actually
tapping
my
thought-stream
so
as
to
switch
off
the
usual
current
and
inject
her
own
how
mad
that
sounds
i
know
it
but
it's
true
it's
the
only
way
i
can
express
it
moreover
while
the
operation
terrified
me
the
skill
with
which
it
was
accomplished
filled
me
afresh
with
laughter
at
the
clumsiness
of
men
by
comparison
our
ignorant
bungling
methods
of
teaching
the
minds
of
others
of
inculcating
ideas
and
so
on
overwhelmed
me
with
laughter
when
i
understood
this
superior
and
diabolical
method
yet
my
laughter
seemed
hollow
and
ghastly
and
ideas
of
evil
and
tragedy
trod
close
upon
the
heels
of
the
comic
oh
doctor
i
tell
you
again
it
was
unnerving
john
silence
sat
with
his
head
thrust
forward
to
catch
every
word
of
the
story
which
the
other
continued
to
pour
out
in
nervous
jerky
sentences
and
lowered
voice
you
saw
nothing--no
one--all
this
time
he
asked
not
with
my
eyes
there
was
no
visual
hallucination
but
in
my
mind
there
began
to
grow
the
vivid
picture
of
a
woman--large
dark-skinned
with
white
teeth
and
masculine
features
and
one
eye--the
left--so
drooping
as
to
appear
almost
closed
oh
such
a
face--
a
face
you
would
recognise
again
pender
laughed
dreadfully
i
wish
i
could
forget
it
he
whispered
i
only
wish
i
could
forget
it
then
he
sat
forward
in
his
chair
suddenly
and
grasped
the
doctor's
hand
with
an
emotional
gesture
i
must
tell
you
how
grateful
i
am
for
your
patience
and
sympathy
he
cried
with
a
tremor
in
his
voice
and--that
you
do
not
think
me
mad
i
have
told
no
one
else
a
quarter
of
all
this
and
the
mere
freedom
of
speech--the
relief
of
sharing
my
affliction
with
another--has
helped
me
already
more
than
i
can
possibly
say
dr
silence
pressed
his
hand
and
looked
steadily
into
the
frightened
eyes
his
voice
was
very
gentle
when
he
replied
your
case
you
know
is
very
singular
but
of
absorbing
interest
to
me
he
said
for
it
threatens
not
your
physical
existence
but
the
temple
of
your
psychical
existence--the
inner
life
your
mind
would
not
be
permanently
affected
here
and
now
in
this
world
but
in
the
existence
after
the
body
is
left
behind
you
might
wake
up
with
your
spirit
so
twisted
so
distorted
so
befouled
that
you
would
be
spiritually
insane--a
far
more
radical
condition
than
merely
being
insane
here
there
came
a
strange
hush
over
the
room
and
between
the
two
men
sitting
there
facing
one
another
do
you
really
mean--good
lord
stammered
the
author
as
soon
as
he
could
find
his
tongue
what
i
mean
in
detail
will
keep
till
a
little
later
and
i
need
only
say
now
that
i
should
not
have
spoken
in
this
way
unless
i
were
quite
positive
of
being
able
to
help
you
oh
there's
no
doubt
as
to
that
believe
me
in
the
first
place
i
am
very
familiar
with
the
workings
of
this
extraordinary
drug
this
drug
which
has
had
the
chance
effect
of
opening
you
up
to
the
forces
of
another
region
and
in
the
second
i
have
a
firm
belief
in
the
reality
of
supersensuous
occurrences
as
well
as
considerable
knowledge
of
psychic
processes
acquired
by
long
and
painful
experiment
the
rest
is
or
should
be
merely
sympathetic
treatment
and
practical
application
the
hashish
has
partially
opened
another
world
to
you
by
increasing
your
rate
of
psychical
vibration
and
thus
rendering
you
abnormally
sensitive
ancient
forces
attached
to
this
house
have
attacked
you
for
the
moment
i
am
only
puzzled
as
to
their
precise
nature
for
were
they
of
an
ordinary
character
i
should
myself
be
psychic
enough
to
feel
them
yet
i
am
conscious
of
feeling
nothing
as
yet
but
now
please
continue
mr
pender
and
tell
me
the
rest
of
your
wonderful
story
and
when
you
have
finished
i
will
talk
about
the
means
of
cure
pender
shifted
his
chair
a
little
closer
to
the
friendly
doctor
and
then
went
on
in
the
same
nervous
voice
with
his
narrative
after
making
some
notes
of
my
impressions
i
finally
got
upstairs
again
to
bed
it
was
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
i
laughed
all
the
way
up--at
the
grotesque
banisters
the
droll
physiognomy
of
the
staircase
window
the
burlesque
grouping
of
the
furniture
and
the
memory
of
that
outrageous
footstool
in
the
room
below
but
nothing
more
happened
to
alarm
or
disturb
me
and
i
woke
late
in
the
morning
after
a
dreamless
sleep
none
the
worse
for
my
experiment
except
for
a
slight
headache
and
a
coldness
of
the
extremities
due
to
lowered
circulation
fear
gone
too
asked
the
doctor
i
seemed
to
have
forgotten
it
or
at
least
ascribed
it
to
mere
nervousness
its
reality
had
gone
anyhow
for
the
time
and
all
that
day
i
wrote
and
wrote
and
wrote
my
sense
of
laughter
seemed
wonderfully
quickened
and
my
characters
acted
without
effort
out
of
the
heart
of
true
humour
i
was
exceedingly
pleased
with
this
result
of
my
experiment
but
when
the
stenographer
had
taken
her
departure
and
i
came
to
read
over
the
pages
she
had
typed
out
i
recalled
her
sudden
glances
of
surprise
and
the
odd
way
she
had
looked
up
at
me
while
i
was
dictating
i
was
amazed
at
what
i
read
and
could
hardly
believe
i
had
uttered
it
and
why
it
was
so
distorted
the
words
indeed
were
mine
so
far
as
i
could
remember
but
the
meanings
seemed
strange
it
frightened
me
the
sense
was
so
altered
at
the
very
places
where
my
characters
were
intended
to
tickle
the
ribs
only
curious
emotions
of
sinister
amusement
resulted
dreadful
innuendoes
had
managed
to
creep
into
the
phrases
there
was
laughter
of
a
kind
but
it
was
bizarre
horrible
distressing
and
my
attempt
at
analysis
only
increased
my
dismay
the
story
as
it
read
then
made
me
shudder
for
by
virtue
of
these
slight
changes
it
had
come
somehow
to
hold
the
soul
of
horror
of
horror
disguised
as
merriment
the
framework
of
humour
was
there
if
you
understand
me
but
the
characters
had
turned
sinister
and
their
laughter
was
evil
can
you
show
me
this
writing
the
author
shook
his
head
i
destroyed
it
he
whispered
but
in
the
end
though
of
course
much
perturbed
about
it
i
persuaded
myself
that
it
was
due
to
some
after-effect
of
the
drug
a
sort
of
reaction
that
gave
a
twist
to
my
mind
and
made
me
read
macabre
interpretations
into
words
and
situations
that
did
not
properly
hold
them
and
meanwhile
did
the
presence
of
this
person
leave
you
no
that
stayed
more
or
less
when
my
mind
was
actively
employed
i
forgot
it
but
when
idle
dreaming
or
doing
nothing
in
particular
there
she
was
beside
me
influencing
my
mind
horribly--
in
what
way
precisely
interrupted
the
doctor
evil
scheming
thoughts
came
to
me
visions
of
crime
hateful
pictures
of
wickedness
and
the
kind
of
bad
imagination
that
so
far
has
been
foreign
indeed
impossible
to
my
normal
nature--
the
pressure
of
the
dark
powers
upon
the
personality
murmured
the
doctor
making
a
quick
note
eh
i
didn't
quite
catch--
pray
go
on
i
am
merely
making
notes
you
shall
know
their
purport
fully
later
even
when
my
wife
returned
i
was
still
aware
of
this
presence
in
the
house
it
associated
itself
with
my
inner
personality
in
most
intimate
fashion
and
outwardly
i
always
felt
oddly
constrained
to
be
polite
and
respectful
towards
it--to
open
doors
provide
chairs
and
hold
myself
carefully
deferential
when
it
was
about
it
became
very
compelling
at
last
and
if
i
failed
in
any
little
particular
i
seemed
to
know
that
it
pursued
me
about
the
house
from
one
room
to
another
haunting
my
very
soul
in
its
inmost
abode
it
certainly
came
before
my
wife
so
far
as
my
attentions
were
concerned
but
let
me
first
finish
the
story
of
my
experimental
dose
for
i
took
it
again
the
third
night
and
underwent
a
very
similar
experience
delayed
like
the
first
in
coming
and
then
carrying
me
off
my
feet
when
it
did
come
with
a
rush
of
this
false
demon-laughter
this
time
however
there
was
a
reversal
of
the
changed
scale
of
space
and
time
it
shortened
instead
of
lengthened
so
that
i
dressed
and
got
downstairs
in
about
twenty
seconds
and
the
couple
of
hours
i
stayed
and
worked
in
the
study
passed
literally
like
a
period
of
ten
minutes
that
is
often
true
of
an
overdose
interjected
the
doctor
and
you
may
go
a
mile
in
a
few
minutes
or
a
few
yards
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
is
quite
incomprehensible
to
those
who
have
never
experienced
it
and
is
a
curious
proof
that
time
and
space
are
merely
forms
of
thought
this
time
pender
went
on
talking
more
and
more
rapidly
in
his
excitement
another
extraordinary
effect
came
to
me
and
i
experienced
a
curious
changing
of
the
senses
so
that
i
perceived
external
things
through
one
large
main
sense-channel
instead
of
through
the
five
divisions
known
as
sight
smell
touch
and
so
forth
you
will
i
know
understand
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
heard
sights
and
saw
sounds
no
language
can
make
this
comprehensible
of
course
and
i
can
only
say
for
instance
that
the
striking
of
the
clock
i
saw
as
a
visible
picture
in
the
air
before
me
i
saw
the
sounds
of
the
tinkling
bell
and
in
precisely
the
same
way
i
heard
the
colours
in
the
room
especially
the
colours
of
those
books
in
the
shelf
behind
you
those
red
bindings
i
heard
in
deep
sounds
and
the
yellow
covers
of
the
french
bindings
next
to
them
made
a
shrill
piercing
note
not
unlike
the
chattering
of
starlings
that
brown
bookcase
muttered
and
those
green
curtains
opposite
kept
up
a
constant
sort
of
rippling
sound
like
the
lower
notes
of
a
wood-horn
but
i
only
was
conscious
of
these
sounds
when
i
looked
steadily
at
the
different
objects
and
thought
about
them
the
room
you
understand
was
not
full
of
a
chorus
of
notes
but
when
i
concentrated
my
mind
upon
a
colour
i
heard
as
well
as
saw
it
that
is
a
known
though
rarely
obtained
effect
of
cannabis
indica
observed
the
doctor
and
it
provoked
laughter
again
did
it
only
the
muttering
of
the
cupboard-bookcase
made
me
laugh
it
was
so
like
a
great
animal
trying
to
get
itself
noticed
and
made
me
think
of
a
performing
bear--which
is
full
of
a
kind
of
pathetic
humour
you
know
but
this
mingling
of
the
senses
produced
no
confusion
in
my
brain
on
the
contrary
i
was
unusually
clear-headed
and
experienced
an
intensification
of
consciousness
and
felt
marvellously
alive
and
keen-minded
moreover
when
i
took
up
a
pencil
in
obedience
to
an
impulse
to
sketch--a
talent
not
normally
mine--i
found
that
i
could
draw
nothing
but
heads
nothing
in
fact
but
one
head--always
the
same--the
head
of
a
dark-skinned
woman
with
huge
and
terrible
features
and
a
very
drooping
left
eye
and
so
well
drawn
too
that
i
was
amazed
as
you
may
imagine--
and
the
expression
of
the
face--
pender
hesitated
a
moment
for
words
casting
about
with
his
hands
in
the
air
and
hunching
his
shoulders
a
perceptible
shudder
ran
over
him
what
i
can
only
describe
as--blackness
he
replied
in
a
low
tone
the
face
of
a
dark
and
evil
soul
you
destroyed
that
too
queried
the
doctor
sharply
no
i
have
kept
the
drawings
he
said
with
a
laugh
and
rose
to
get
them
from
a
drawer
in
the
writing-desk
behind
him
here
is
all
that
remains
of
the
pictures
you
see
he
added
pushing
a
number
of
loose
sheets
under
the
doctor's
eyes
nothing
but
a
few
scrawly
lines
that's
all
i
found
the
next
morning
i
had
really
drawn
no
heads
at
all--nothing
but
those
lines
and
blots
and
wriggles
the
pictures
were
entirely
subjective
and
existed
only
in
my
mind
which
constructed
them
out
of
a
few
wild
strokes
of
the
pen
like
the
altered
scale
of
space
and
time
it
was
a
complete
delusion
these
all
passed
of
course
with
the
passing
of
the
drug's
effects
but
the
other
thing
did
not
pass
i
mean
the
presence
of
that
dark
soul
remained
with
me
it
is
here
still
it
is
real
i
don't
know
how
i
can
escape
from
it
it
is
attached
to
the
house
not
to
you
personally
you
must
leave
the
house
yes
only
i
cannot
afford
to
leave
the
house
for
my
work
is
my
sole
means
of
support
and--well
you
see
since
this
change
i
cannot
even
write
they
are
horrible
these
mirthless
tales
i
now
write
with
their
mockery
of
laughter
their
diabolical
suggestion
horrible
i
shall
go
mad
if
this
continues
he
screwed
his
face
up
and
looked
about
the
room
as
though
he
expected
to
see
some
haunting
shape
this
influence
in
this
house
induced
by
my
experiment
has
killed
in
a
flash
in
a
sudden
stroke
the
sources
of
my
humour
and
though
i
still
go
on
writing
funny
tales--i
have
a
certain
name
you
know--my
inspiration
has
dried
up
and
much
of
what
i
write
i
have
to
burn--yes
doctor
to
burn
before
any
one
sees
it
as
utterly
alien
to
your
own
mind
and
personality
utterly
as
though
some
one
else
had
written
it--
ah
and
shocking
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
a
moment
and
let
the
breath
escape
softly
through
his
teeth
yet
most
damnably
clever
in
the
consummate
way
the
vile
suggestions
are
insinuated
under
cover
of
a
kind
of
high
drollery
my
stenographer
left
me
of
course--and
i've
been
afraid
to
take
another--
john
silence
got
up
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
leisurely
without
speaking
he
appeared
to
be
examining
the
pictures
on
the
wall
and
reading
the
names
of
the
books
lying
about
presently
he
paused
on
the
hearthrug
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
turned
to
look
his
patient
quietly
in
the
eyes
pender's
face
was
grey
and
drawn
the
hunted
expression
dominated
it
the
long
recital
had
told
upon
him
thank
you
mr
pender
he
said
a
curious
glow
showing
about
his
fine
quiet
face
thank
you
for
the
sincerity
and
frankness
of
your
account
but
i
think
now
there
is
nothing
further
i
need
ask
you
he
indulged
in
a
long
scrutiny
of
the
author's
haggard
features
drawing
purposely
the
man's
eyes
to
his
own
and
then
meeting
them
with
a
look
of
power
and
confidence
calculated
to
inspire
even
the
feeblest
soul
with
courage
and
to
begin
with
he
added
smiling
pleasantly
let
me
assure
you
without
delay
that
you
need
have
no
alarm
for
you
are
no
more
insane
or
deluded
than
i
myself
am--
pender
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
tried
to
return
the
smile
--and
this
is
simply
a
case
so
far
as
i
can
judge
at
present
of
a
very
singular
psychical
invasion
and
a
very
sinister
one
too
if
you
perhaps
understand
what
i
mean--
it's
an
odd
expression
you
used
it
before
you
know
said
the
author
wearily
yet
eagerly
listening
to
every
word
of
the
diagnosis
and
deeply
touched
by
the
intelligent
sympathy
which
did
not
at
once
indicate
the
lunatic
asylum
possibly
returned
the
other
and
an
odd
affliction
too
you'll
allow
yet
one
not
unknown
to
the
nations
of
antiquity
nor
to
those
moderns
perhaps
who
recognise
the
freedom
of
action
under
certain
pathogenic
conditions
between
this
world
and
another
and
you
think
asked
pender
hastily
that
it
is
all
primarily
due
to
the
cannabis
there
is
nothing
radically
amiss
with
myself--nothing
incurable
or--
due
entirely
to
the
overdose
dr
silence
replied
emphatically
to
the
drug's
direct
action
upon
your
psychical
being
it
rendered
you
ultra-sensitive
and
made
you
respond
to
an
increased
rate
of
vibration
and
let
me
tell
you
mr
pender
that
your
experiment
might
have
had
results
far
more
dire
it
has
brought
you
into
touch
with
a
somewhat
singular
class
of
invisible
but
of
one
i
think
chiefly
human
in
character
you
might
however
just
as
easily
have
been
drawn
out
of
human
range
altogether
and
the
results
of
such
a
contingency
would
have
been
exceedingly
terrible
indeed
you
would
not
now
be
here
to
tell
the
tale
i
need
not
alarm
you
on
that
score
but
mention
it
as
a
warning
you
will
not
misunderstand
or
underrate
after
what
you
have
been
through
you
look
puzzled
you
do
not
quite
gather
what
i
am
driving
at
and
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
you
should
for
you
i
suppose
are
the
nominal
christian
with
the
nominal
christian's
lofty
standard
of
ethics
and
his
utter
ignorance
of
spiritual
possibilities
beyond
a
somewhat
childish
understanding
of
'spiritual
wickedness
in
high
places'
you
probably
have
no
conception
of
what
is
possible
once
you
break-down
the
slender
gulf
that
is
mercifully
fixed
between
you
and
that
outer
world
but
my
studies
and
training
have
taken
me
far
outside
these
orthodox
trips
and
i
have
made
experiments
that
i
could
scarcely
speak
to
you
about
in
language
that
would
be
intelligible
to
you
he
paused
a
moment
to
note
the
breathless
interest
of
pender's
face
and
manner
every
word
he
uttered
was
calculated
he
knew
exactly
the
value
and
effect
of
the
emotions
he
desired
to
waken
in
the
heart
of
the
afflicted
being
before
him
and
from
certain
knowledge
i
have
gained
through
various
experiences
he
continued
calmly
i
can
diagnose
your
case
as
i
said
before
to
be
one
of
psychical
invasion
and
the
nature
of
this--er--invasion
stammered
the
bewildered
writer
of
humorous
tales
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
say
at
once
that
i
do
not
yet
quite
know
replied
dr
silence
i
may
first
have
to
make
one
or
two
experiments--
on
me
gasped
pender
catching
his
breath
not
exactly
the
doctor
said
with
a
grave
smile
but
with
your
assistance
perhaps
i
shall
want
to
test
the
conditions
of
the
house--to
ascertain
impossible
the
character
of
the
forces
of
this
strange
personality
that
has
been
haunting
you--
at
present
you
have
no
idea
exactly
who--what--why--
asked
the
other
in
a
wild
flurry
of
interest
dread
and
amazement
i
have
a
very
good
idea
but
no
proof
rather
returned
the
doctor
the
effects
of
the
drug
in
altering
the
scale
of
time
and
space
and
merging
the
senses
have
nothing
primarily
to
do
with
the
invasion
they
come
to
any
one
who
is
fool
enough
to
take
an
experimental
dose
it
is
the
other
features
of
your
case
that
are
unusual
you
see
you
are
now
in
touch
with
certain
violent
emotions
desires
purposes
still
active
in
this
house
that
were
produced
in
the
past
by
some
powerful
and
evil
personality
that
lived
here
how
long
ago
or
why
they
still
persist
so
forcibly
i
cannot
positively
say
but
i
should
judge
that
they
are
merely
forces
acting
automatically
with
the
momentum
of
their
terrific
original
impetus
not
directed
by
a
living
being
a
conscious
will
you
mean
possibly
not--but
none
the
less
dangerous
on
that
account
and
more
difficult
to
deal
with
i
cannot
explain
to
you
in
a
few
minutes
the
nature
of
such
things
for
you
have
not
made
the
studies
that
would
enable
you
to
follow
me
but
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
on
the
dissolution
at
death
of
a
human
being
its
forces
may
still
persist
and
continue
to
act
in
a
blind
unconscious
fashion
as
a
rule
they
speedily
dissipate
themselves
but
in
the
case
of
a
very
powerful
personality
they
may
last
a
long
time
and
in
some
cases--of
which
i
incline
to
think
this
is
one--these
forces
may
coalesce
with
certain
non-human
entities
who
thus
continue
their
life
indefinitely
and
increase
their
strength
to
an
unbelievable
degree
if
the
original
personality
was
evil
the
beings
attracted
to
the
left-over
forces
will
also
be
evil
in
this
case
i
think
there
has
been
an
unusual
and
dreadful
aggrandisement
of
the
thoughts
and
purposes
left
behind
long
ago
by
a
woman
of
consummate
wickedness
and
great
personal
power
of
character
and
intellect
now
do
you
begin
to
see
what
i
am
driving
at
a
little
pender
stared
fixedly
at
his
companion
plain
horror
showing
in
his
eyes
but
he
found
nothing
to
say
and
the
doctor
continued--
in
your
case
predisposed
by
the
action
of
the
drug
you
have
experienced
the
rush
of
these
forces
in
undiluted
strength
they
wholly
obliterate
in
you
the
sense
of
humour
fancy
imagination--all
that
makes
for
cheerfulness
and
hope
they
seek
though
perhaps
automatically
only
to
oust
your
own
thoughts
and
establish
themselves
in
their
place
you
are
the
victim
of
a
psychical
invasion
at
the
same
time
you
have
become
clairvoyant
in
the
true
sense
you
are
also
a
clairvoyant
victim
pender
mopped
his
face
and
sighed
he
left
his
chair
and
went
over
to
the
fireplace
to
warm
himself
you
must
think
me
a
quack
to
talk
like
this
or
a
madman
laughed
dr
silence
but
never
mind
that
i
have
come
to
help
you
and
i
can
help
you
if
you
will
do
what
i
tell
you
it
is
very
simple
you
must
leave
this
house
at
once
oh
never
mind
the
difficulties
we
will
deal
with
those
together
i
can
place
another
house
at
your
disposal
or
i
would
take
the
lease
here
off
your
hands
and
later
have
it
pulled
down
your
case
interests
me
greatly
and
i
mean
to
see
you
through
so
that
you
have
no
anxiety
and
can
drop
back
into
your
old
groove
of
work
tomorrow
the
drug
has
provided
you
and
therefore
me
with
a
shortcut
to
a
very
interesting
experience
i
am
grateful
to
you
the
author
poked
the
fire
vigorously
emotion
rising
in
him
like
a
tide
he
glanced
towards
the
door
nervously
there
is
no
need
to
alarm
your
wife
or
to
tell
her
the
details
of
our
conversation
pursued
the
other
quietly
let
her
know
that
you
will
soon
be
in
possession
again
of
your
sense
of
humour
and
your
health
and
explain
that
i
am
lending
you
another
house
for
six
months
meanwhile
i
may
have
the
right
to
use
this
house
for
a
night
or
two
for
my
experiment
is
that
understood
between
us
i
can
only
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
stammered
pender
unable
to
find
words
to
express
his
gratitude
then
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
searching
the
doctor's
face
anxiously
and
your
experiment
with
the
house
he
said
at
length
of
the
simplest
character
my
dear
mr
pender
although
i
am
myself
an
artificially
trained
psychic
and
consequently
aware
of
the
presence
of
discarnate
entities
as
a
rule
i
have
so
far
felt
nothing
here
at
all
this
makes
me
sure
that
the
forces
acting
here
are
of
an
unusual
description
what
i
propose
to
do
is
to
make
an
experiment
with
a
view
of
drawing
out
this
evil
coaxing
it
from
its
lair
so
to
speak
in
order
that
it
may
exhaust
itself
through
me
and
become
dissipated
for
ever
i
have
already
been
inoculated
he
added
i
consider
myself
to
be
immune
heavens
above
gasped
the
author
collapsing
on
to
a
chair
hell
beneath
might
be
a
more
appropriate
exclamation
the
doctor
laughed
but
seriously
mr
pender
this
is
what
i
propose
to
do--with
your
permission
of
course
of
course
cried
the
other
you
have
my
permission
and
my
best
wishes
for
success
i
can
see
no
possible
objection
but--
but
what
i
pray
to
heaven
you
will
not
undertake
this
experiment
alone
will
you
oh
dear
no
not
alone
you
will
take
a
companion
with
good
nerves
and
reliable
in
case
of
disaster
won't
you
i
shall
bring
two
companions
the
doctor
said
ah
that's
better
i
feel
easier
i
am
sure
you
must
have
among
your
acquaintances
men
who--
i
shall
not
think
of
bringing
men
mr
pender
the
other
looked
up
sharply
no
or
women
either
or
children
i
don't
understand
who
will
you
bring
then
animals
explained
the
doctor
unable
to
prevent
a
smile
at
his
companion's
expression
of
surprise--two
animals
a
cat
and
a
dog
pender
stared
as
if
his
eyes
would
drop
out
upon
the
floor
and
then
led
the
way
without
another
word
into
the
adjoining
room
where
his
wife
was
awaiting
them
for
tea
ii
a
few
days
later
the
humorist
and
his
wife
with
minds
greatly
relieved
moved
into
a
small
furnished
house
placed
at
their
free
disposal
in
another
part
of
london
and
john
silence
intent
upon
his
approaching
experiment
made
ready
to
spend
a
night
in
the
empty
house
on
the
top
of
putney
hill
only
two
rooms
were
prepared
for
occupation
the
study
on
the
ground
floor
and
the
bedroom
immediately
above
it
all
other
doors
were
to
be
locked
and
no
servant
was
to
be
left
in
the
house
the
motor
had
orders
to
call
for
him
at
nine
o'clock
the
following
morning
and
meanwhile
his
secretary
had
instructions
to
look
up
the
past
history
and
associations
of
the
place
and
learn
everything
he
could
concerning
the
character
of
former
occupants
recent
or
remote
the
animals
by
whose
sensitiveness
he
intended
to
test
any
unusual
conditions
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
building
dr
silence
selected
with
care
and
judgment
he
believed
and
had
already
made
curious
experiments
to
prove
it
that
animals
were
more
often
and
more
truly
clairvoyant
than
human
beings
many
of
them
he
felt
convinced
possessed
powers
of
perception
far
superior
to
that
mere
keenness
of
the
senses
common
to
all
dwellers
in
the
wilds
where
the
senses
grow
specially
alert
they
had
what
he
termed
animal
clairvoyance
and
from
his
experiments
with
horses
dogs
cats
and
even
birds
he
had
drawn
certain
deductions
which
however
need
not
be
referred
to
in
detail
here
cats
in
particular
he
believed
were
almost
continuously
conscious
of
a
larger
field
of
vision
too
detailed
even
for
a
photographic
camera
and
quite
beyond
the
reach
of
normal
human
organs
he
had
further
observed
that
while
dogs
were
usually
terrified
in
the
presence
of
such
phenomena
cats
on
the
other
hand
were
soothed
and
satisfied
they
welcomed
manifestations
as
something
belonging
peculiarly
to
their
own
region
he
selected
his
animals
therefore
with
wisdom
so
that
they
might
afford
a
differing
test
each
in
its
own
way
and
that
one
should
not
merely
communicate
its
own
excitement
to
the
other
he
took
a
dog
and
a
cat
the
cat
he
chose
now
full
grown
had
lived
with
him
since
kittenhood
a
kittenhood
of
perplexing
sweetness
and
audacious
mischief
wayward
it
was
and
fanciful
ever
playing
its
own
mysterious
games
in
the
corners
of
the
room
jumping
at
invisible
nothings
leaping
sideways
into
the
air
and
falling
with
tiny
moccasined
feet
on
to
another
part
of
the
carpet
yet
with
an
air
of
dignified
earnestness
which
showed
that
the
performance
was
necessary
to
its
own
well-being
and
not
done
merely
to
impress
a
stupid
human
audience
in
the
middle
of
elaborate
washing
it
would
look
up
startled
as
though
to
stare
at
the
approach
of
some
invisible
cocking
its
little
head
sideways
and
putting
out
a
velvet
pad
to
inspect
cautiously
then
it
would
get
absent-minded
and
stare
with
equal
intentness
in
another
direction
just
to
confuse
the
onlookers
and
suddenly
go
on
furiously
washing
its
body
again
but
in
quite
a
new
place
except
for
a
white
patch
on
its
breast
it
was
coal
black
and
its
name
was--smoke
smoke
described
its
temperament
as
well
as
its
appearance
its
movements
its
individuality
its
posing
as
a
little
furry
mass
of
concealed
mysteries
its
elfin-like
elusiveness
all
combined
to
justify
its
name
and
a
subtle
painter
might
have
pictured
it
as
a
wisp
of
floating
smoke
the
fire
below
betraying
itself
at
two
points
only--the
glowing
eyes
all
its
forces
ran
to
intelligence--secret
intelligence
the
wordless
incalculable
intuition
of
the
cat
it
was
indeed
the
cat
for
the
business
in
hand
the
selection
of
the
dog
was
not
so
simple
for
the
doctor
owned
many
but
after
much
deliberation
he
chose
a
collie
called
flame
from
his
yellow
coat
true
it
was
a
trifle
old
and
stiff
in
the
joints
and
even
beginning
to
grow
deaf
but
on
the
other
hand
it
was
a
very
particular
friend
of
smoke's
and
had
fathered
it
from
kittenhood
upwards
so
that
a
subtle
understanding
existed
between
them
it
was
this
that
turned
the
balance
in
its
favour
this
and
its
courage
moreover
though
good-tempered
it
was
a
terrible
fighter
and
its
anger
when
provoked
by
a
righteous
cause
was
a
fury
of
fire
and
irresistible
it
had
come
to
him
quite
young
straight
from
the
shepherd
with
the
air
of
the
hills
yet
in
its
nostrils
and
was
then
little
more
than
skin
and
bones
and
teeth
for
a
collie
it
was
sturdily
built
its
nose
blunter
than
most
its
yellow
hair
stiff
rather
than
silky
and
it
had
full
eyes
unlike
the
slit
eyes
of
its
breed
only
its
master
could
touch
it
for
it
ignored
strangers
and
despised
their
pattings--when
any
dared
to
pat
it
there
was
something
patriarchal
about
the
old
beast
he
was
in
earnest
and
went
through
life
with
tremendous
energy
and
big
things
in
view
as
though
he
had
the
reputation
of
his
whole
race
to
uphold
and
to
watch
him
fighting
against
odds
was
to
understand
why
he
was
terrible
in
his
relations
with
smoke
he
was
always
absurdly
gentle
also
he
was
fatherly
and
at
the
same
time
betrayed
a
certain
diffidence
or
shyness
he
recognised
that
smoke
called
for
strong
yet
respectful
management
the
cat's
circuitous
methods
puzzled
him
and
his
elaborate
pretences
perhaps
shocked
the
dog's
liking
for
direct
undisguised
action
yet
while
he
failed
to
comprehend
these
tortuous
feline
mysteries
he
was
never
contemptuous
or
condescending
and
he
presided
over
the
safety
of
his
furry
black
friend
somewhat
as
a
father
loving
but
intuitive
might
superintend
the
vagaries
of
a
wayward
and
talented
child
and
in
return
smoke
rewarded
him
with
exhibitions
of
fascinating
and
audacious
mischief
and
these
brief
descriptions
of
their
characters
are
necessary
for
the
proper
understanding
of
what
subsequently
took
place
with
smoke
sleeping
in
the
folds
of
his
fur
coat
and
the
collie
lying
watchful
on
the
seat
opposite
john
silence
went
down
in
his
motor
after
dinner
on
the
night
of
november
15th
and
the
fog
was
so
dense
that
they
were
obliged
to
travel
at
quarter
speed
the
entire
way





it
was
after
ten
o'clock
when
he
dismissed
the
motor
and
entered
the
dingy
little
house
with
the
latchkey
provided
by
pender
he
found
the
hall
gas
turned
low
and
a
fire
in
the
study
books
and
food
had
also
been
placed
ready
by
the
servant
according
to
instructions
coils
of
fog
rushed
in
after
him
through
the
open
door
and
filled
the
hall
and
passage
with
its
cold
discomfort
the
first
thing
dr
silence
did
was
to
lock
up
smoke
in
the
study
with
a
saucer
of
milk
before
the
fire
and
then
make
a
search
of
the
house
with
flame
the
dog
ran
cheerfully
behind
him
all
the
way
while
he
tried
the
doors
of
the
other
rooms
to
make
sure
they
were
locked
he
nosed
about
into
corners
and
made
little
excursions
on
his
own
account
his
manner
was
expectant
he
knew
there
must
be
something
unusual
about
the
proceeding
because
it
was
contrary
to
the
habits
of
his
whole
life
not
to
be
asleep
at
this
hour
on
the
mat
in
front
of
the
fire
he
kept
looking
up
into
his
master's
face
as
door
after
door
was
tried
with
an
expression
of
intelligent
sympathy
but
at
the
same
time
a
certain
air
of
disapproval
yet
everything
his
master
did
was
good
in
his
eyes
and
he
betrayed
as
little
impatience
as
possible
with
all
this
unnecessary
journeying
to
and
fro
if
the
doctor
was
pleased
to
play
this
sort
of
game
at
such
an
hour
of
the
night
it
was
surely
not
for
him
to
object
so
he
played
it
too
and
was
very
busy
and
earnest
about
it
into
the
bargain
after
an
uneventful
search
they
came
down
again
to
the
study
and
here
dr
silence
discovered
smoke
washing
his
face
calmly
in
front
of
the
fire
the
saucer
of
milk
was
licked
dry
and
clean
the
preliminary
examination
that
cats
always
make
in
new
surroundings
had
evidently
been
satisfactorily
concluded
he
drew
an
arm-chair
up
to
the
fire
stirred
the
coals
into
a
blaze
arranged
the
table
and
lamp
to
his
satisfaction
for
reading
and
then
prepared
surreptitiously
to
watch
the
animals
he
wished
to
observe
them
carefully
without
their
being
aware
of
it
now
in
spite
of
their
respective
ages
it
was
the
regular
custom
of
these
two
to
play
together
every
night
before
sleep
smoke
always
made
the
advances
beginning
with
grave
impudence
to
pat
the
dog's
tail
and
flame
played
cumbrously
with
condescension
it
was
his
duty
rather
than
pleasure
he
was
glad
when
it
was
over
and
sometimes
he
was
very
determined
and
refused
to
play
at
all
and
this
night
was
one
of
the
occasions
on
which
he
was
firm
the
doctor
looking
cautiously
over
the
top
of
his
book
watched
the
cat
begin
the
performance
it
started
by
gazing
with
an
innocent
expression
at
the
dog
where
he
lay
with
nose
on
paws
and
eyes
wide
open
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
then
it
got
up
and
made
as
though
it
meant
to
walk
to
the
door
going
deliberately
and
very
softly
flame's
eyes
followed
it
until
it
was
beyond
the
range
of
sight
and
then
the
cat
turned
sharply
and
began
patting
his
tail
tentatively
with
one
paw
the
tail
moved
slightly
in
reply
and
smoke
changed
paws
and
tapped
it
again
the
dog
however
did
not
rise
to
play
as
was
his
wont
and
the
cat
fell
to
parting
it
briskly
with
both
paws
flame
still
lay
motionless
this
puzzled
and
bored
the
cat
and
it
went
round
and
stared
hard
into
its
friend's
face
to
see
what
was
the
matter
perhaps
some
inarticulate
message
flashed
from
the
dog's
eyes
into
its
own
little
brain
making
it
understand
that
the
programme
for
the
night
had
better
not
begin
with
play
perhaps
it
only
realised
that
its
friend
was
immovable
but
whatever
the
reason
its
usual
persistence
thenceforward
deserted
it
and
it
made
no
further
attempts
at
persuasion
smoke
yielded
at
once
to
the
dog's
mood
it
sat
down
where
it
was
and
began
to
wash
but
the
washing
the
doctor
noted
was
by
no
means
its
real
purpose
it
only
used
it
to
mask
something
else
it
stopped
at
the
most
busy
and
furious
moments
and
began
to
stare
about
the
room
its
thoughts
wandered
absurdly
it
peered
intently
at
the
curtains
at
the
shadowy
corners
at
empty
space
above
leaving
its
body
in
curiously
awkward
positions
for
whole
minutes
together
then
it
turned
sharply
and
stared
with
a
sudden
signal
of
intelligence
at
the
dog
and
flame
at
once
rose
somewhat
stiffly
to
his
feet
and
began
to
wander
aimlessly
and
restlessly
to
and
fro
about
the
floor
smoke
followed
him
padding
quietly
at
his
heels
between
them
they
made
what
seemed
to
be
a
deliberate
search
of
the
room
and
here
as
he
watched
them
noting
carefully
every
detail
of
the
performance
over
the
top
of
his
book
yet
making
no
effort
to
interfere
it
seemed
to
the
doctor
that
the
first
beginnings
of
a
faint
distress
betrayed
themselves
in
the
collie
and
in
the
cat
the
stirrings
of
a
vague
excitement
he
observed
them
closely
the
fog
was
thick
in
the
air
and
the
tobacco
smoke
from
his
pipe
added
to
its
density
the
furniture
at
the
far
end
stood
mistily
and
where
the
shadows
congregated
in
hanging
clouds
under
the
ceiling
it
was
difficult
to
see
clearly
at
all
the
lamplight
only
reached
to
a
level
of
five
feet
from
the
floor
above
which
came
layers
of
comparative
darkness
so
that
the
room
appeared
twice
as
lofty
as
it
actually
was
by
means
of
the
lamp
and
the
fire
however
the
carpet
was
everywhere
clearly
visible
the
animals
made
their
silent
tour
of
the
floor
sometimes
the
dog
leading
sometimes
the
cat
occasionally
they
looked
at
one
another
as
though
exchanging
signals
and
once
or
twice
in
spite
of
the
limited
space
he
lost
sight
of
one
or
other
among
the
fog
and
the
shadows
their
curiosity
it
appeared
to
him
was
something
more
than
the
excitement
lurking
in
the
unknown
territory
of
a
strange
room
yet
so
far
it
was
impossible
to
test
this
and
he
purposely
kept
his
mind
quietly
receptive
lest
the
smallest
mental
excitement
on
his
part
should
communicate
itself
to
the
animals
and
thus
destroy
the
value
of
their
independent
behaviour
they
made
a
very
thorough
journey
leaving
no
piece
of
furniture
unexamined
or
unsmelt
flame
led
the
way
walking
slowly
with
lowered
head
and
smoke
followed
demurely
at
his
heels
making
a
transparent
pretence
of
not
being
interested
yet
missing
nothing
and
at
length
they
returned
the
old
collie
first
and
came
to
rest
on
the
mat
before
the
fire
flame
rested
his
muzzle
on
his
master's
knee
smiling
beatifically
while
he
patted
the
yellow
head
and
spoke
his
name
and
smoke
coming
a
little
later
pretending
he
came
by
chance
looked
from
the
empty
saucer
to
his
face
lapped
up
the
milk
when
it
was
given
him
to
the
last
drop
and
then
sprang
upon
his
knees
and
curled
round
for
the
sleep
it
had
fully
earned
and
intended
to
enjoy
silence
descended
upon
the
room
only
the
breathing
of
the
dog
upon
the
mat
came
through
the
deep
stillness
like
the
pulse
of
time
marking
the
minutes
and
the
steady
drip
drip
of
the
fog
outside
upon
the
window-ledges
dismally
testified
to
the
inclemency
of
the
night
beyond
and
the
soft
crashings
of
the
coals
as
the
fire
settled
down
into
the
grate
became
less
and
less
audible
as
the
fire
sank
and
the
flames
resigned
their
fierceness
it
was
now
well
after
eleven
o'clock
and
dr
silence
devoted
himself
again
to
his
book
he
read
the
words
on
the
printed
page
and
took
in
their
meaning
superficially
yet
without
starting
into
life
the
correlations
of
thought
and
suggestions
that
should
accompany
interesting
reading
underneath
all
the
while
his
mental
energies
were
absorbed
in
watching
listening
waiting
for
what
might
come
he
was
not
over-sanguine
himself
yet
he
did
not
wish
to
be
taken
by
surprise
moreover
the
animals
his
sensitive
barometers
had
incontinently
gone
to
sleep
after
reading
a
dozen
pages
however
he
realised
that
his
mind
was
really
occupied
in
reviewing
the
features
of
pender's
extraordinary
story
and
that
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
steady
his
imagination
by
studying
the
dull
paragraphs
detailed
in
the
pages
before
him
he
laid
down
his
book
accordingly
and
allowed
his
thoughts
to
dwell
upon
the
features
of
the
case
speculations
as
to
the
meaning
however
he
rigorously
suppressed
knowing
that
such
thoughts
would
act
upon
his
imagination
like
wind
upon
the
glowing
embers
of
a
fire
as
the
night
wore
on
the
silence
grew
deeper
and
deeper
and
only
at
rare
intervals
he
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
on
the
main
road
a
hundred
yards
away
where
the
horses
went
at
a
walking
pace
owing
to
the
density
of
the
fog
the
echo
of
pedestrian
footsteps
no
longer
reached
him
the
clamour
of
occasional
voices
no
longer
came
down
the
side
street
the
night
muffled
by
fog
shrouded
by
veils
of
ultimate
mystery
hung
about
the
haunted
villa
like
a
doom
nothing
in
the
house
stirred
stillness
in
a
thick
blanket
lay
over
the
upper
storeys
only
the
mist
in
the
room
grew
more
dense
he
thought
and
the
damp
cold
more
penetrating
certainly
from
time
to
time
he
shivered
the
collie
now
deep
in
slumber
moved
occasionally--grunted
sighed
or
twitched
his
legs
in
dreams
smoke
lay
on
his
knees
a
pool
of
warm
black
fur
only
the
closest
observation
detecting
the
movement
of
his
sleek
sides
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
exactly
where
his
head
and
body
joined
in
that
circle
of
glistening
hair
only
a
black
satin
nose
and
a
tiny
tip
of
pink
tongue
betrayed
the
secret
dr
silence
watched
him
and
felt
comfortable
the
collie's
breathing
was
soothing
the
fire
was
well
built
and
would
burn
for
another
two
hours
without
attention
he
was
not
conscious
of
the
least
nervousness
he
particularly
wished
to
remain
in
his
ordinary
and
normal
state
of
mind
and
to
force
nothing
if
sleep
came
naturally
he
would
let
it
come--and
even
welcome
it
the
coldness
of
the
room
when
the
fire
died
down
later
would
be
sure
to
wake
him
again
and
it
would
then
be
time
enough
to
carry
these
sleeping
barometers
up
to
bed
from
various
psychic
premonitions
he
knew
quite
well
that
the
night
would
not
pass
without
adventure
but
he
did
not
wish
to
force
its
arrival
and
he
wished
to
remain
normal
and
let
the
animals
remain
normal
so
that
when
it
came
it
would
be
unattended
by
excitement
or
by
any
straining
of
the
attention
many
experiments
had
made
him
wise
and
for
the
rest
he
had
no
fear
accordingly
after
a
time
he
did
fall
asleep
as
he
had
expected
and
the
last
thing
he
remembered
before
oblivion
slipped
up
over
his
eyes
like
soft
wool
was
the
picture
of
flame
stretching
all
four
legs
at
once
and
sighing
noisily
as
he
sought
a
more
comfortable
position
for
his
paws
and
muzzle
upon
the
mat





it
was
a
good
deal
later
when
he
became
aware
that
a
weight
lay
upon
his
chest
and
that
something
was
pencilling
over
his
face
and
mouth
a
soft
touch
on
the
cheek
woke
him
something
was
patting
him
he
sat
up
with
a
jerk
and
found
himself
staring
straight
into
a
pair
of
brilliant
eyes
half
green
half
black
smoke's
face
lay
level
with
his
own
and
the
cat
had
climbed
up
with
its
front
paws
upon
his
chest
the
lamp
had
burned
low
and
the
fire
was
nearly
out
yet
dr
silence
saw
in
a
moment
that
the
cat
was
in
an
excited
state
it
kneaded
with
its
front
paws
into
his
chest
shifting
from
one
to
the
other
he
felt
them
prodding
against
him
it
lifted
a
leg
very
carefully
and
patted
his
cheek
gingerly
its
fur
he
saw
was
standing
ridgewise
upon
its
back
the
ears
were
flattened
back
somewhat
the
tail
was
switching
sharply
the
cat
of
course
had
wakened
him
with
a
purpose
and
the
instant
he
realised
this
he
set
it
upon
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
sprang
up
with
a
quick
turn
to
face
the
empty
room
behind
him
by
some
curious
instinct
his
arms
of
their
own
accord
assumed
an
attitude
of
defence
in
front
of
him
as
though
to
ward
off
something
that
threatened
his
safety
yet
nothing
was
visible
only
shapes
of
fog
hung
about
rather
heavily
in
the
air
moving
slightly
to
and
fro
his
mind
was
now
fully
alert
and
the
last
vestiges
of
sleep
gone
he
turned
the
lamp
higher
and
peered
about
him
two
things
he
became
aware
of
at
once
one
that
smoke
while
excited
was
pleasurably
excited
the
other
that
the
collie
was
no
longer
visible
upon
the
mat
at
his
feet
he
had
crept
away
to
the
corner
of
the
wall
farthest
from
the
window
and
lay
watching
the
room
with
wide-open
eyes
in
which
lurked
plainly
something
of
alarm
something
in
the
dog's
behaviour
instantly
struck
dr
silence
as
unusual
and
calling
him
by
name
he
moved
across
to
pat
him
flame
got
up
wagged
his
tail
and
came
over
slowly
to
the
rug
uttering
a
low
sound
that
was
half
growl
half
whine
he
was
evidently
perturbed
about
something
and
his
master
was
proceeding
to
administer
comfort
when
his
attention
was
suddenly
drawn
to
the
antics
of
his
other
four-footed
companion
the
cat
and
what
he
saw
filled
him
with
something
like
amazement
smoke
had
jumped
down
from
the
back
of
the
arm-chair
and
now
occupied
the
middle
of
the
carpet
where
with
tail
erect
and
legs
stiff
as
ramrods
it
was
steadily
pacing
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
narrow
space
uttering
as
it
did
so
those
curious
little
guttural
sounds
of
pleasure
that
only
an
animal
of
the
feline
species
knows
how
to
make
expressive
of
supreme
happiness
its
stiffened
legs
and
arched
back
made
it
appear
larger
than
usual
and
the
black
visage
wore
a
smile
of
beatific
joy
its
eyes
blazed
magnificently
it
was
in
an
ecstasy
at
the
end
of
every
few
paces
it
turned
sharply
and
stalked
back
again
along
the
same
line
padding
softly
and
purring
like
a
roll
of
little
muffled
drums
it
behaved
precisely
as
though
it
were
rubbing
against
the
ankles
of
some
one
who
remained
invisible
a
thrill
ran
down
the
doctor's
spine
as
he
stood
and
stared
his
experiment
was
growing
interesting
at
last
he
called
the
collie's
attention
to
his
friend's
performance
to
see
whether
he
too
was
aware
of
anything
standing
there
upon
the
carpet
and
the
dog's
behaviour
was
significant
and
corroborative
he
came
as
far
as
his
master's
knees
and
then
stopped
dead
refusing
to
investigate
closely
in
vain
dr
silence
urged
him
he
wagged
his
tail
whined
a
little
and
stood
in
a
half-crouching
attitude
staring
alternately
at
the
cat
and
at
his
master's
face
he
was
apparently
both
puzzled
and
alarmed
and
the
whine
went
deeper
and
deeper
down
into
his
throat
till
it
changed
into
an
ugly
snarl
of
awakening
anger
then
the
doctor
called
to
him
in
a
tone
of
command
he
had
never
known
to
be
disregarded
but
still
the
dog
though
springing
up
in
response
declined
to
move
nearer
he
made
tentative
motions
pranced
a
little
like
a
dog
about
to
take
to
water
pretended
to
bark
and
ran
to
and
fro
on
the
carpet
so
far
there
was
no
actual
fear
in
his
manner
but
he
was
uneasy
and
anxious
and
nothing
would
induce
him
to
go
within
touching
distance
of
the
walking
cat
once
he
made
a
complete
circuit
but
always
carefully
out
of
reach
and
in
the
end
he
returned
to
his
master's
legs
and
rubbed
vigorously
against
him
flame
did
not
like
the
performance
at
all
that
much
was
quite
clear
for
several
minutes
john
silence
watched
the
performance
of
the
cat
with
profound
attention
and
without
interfering
then
he
called
to
the
animal
by
name
smoke
you
mysterious
beastie
what
in
the
world
are
you
about
he
said
in
a
coaxing
tone
the
cat
looked
up
at
him
for
a
moment
smiling
in
its
ecstasy
blinking
its
eyes
but
too
happy
to
pause
he
spoke
to
it
again
he
called
to
it
several
times
and
each
time
it
turned
upon
him
its
blazing
eyes
drunk
with
inner
delight
opening
and
shutting
its
lips
its
body
large
and
rigid
with
excitement
yet
it
never
for
one
instant
paused
in
its
short
journeys
to
and
fro
he
noted
exactly
what
it
did
it
walked
he
saw
the
same
number
of
paces
each
time
some
six
or
seven
steps
and
then
it
turned
sharply
and
retraced
them
by
the
pattern
of
the
great
roses
in
the
carpet
he
measured
it
it
kept
to
the
same
direction
and
the
same
line
it
behaved
precisely
as
though
it
were
rubbing
against
something
solid
undoubtedly
there
was
something
standing
there
on
that
strip
of
carpet
something
invisible
to
the
doctor
something
that
alarmed
the
dog
yet
caused
the
cat
unspeakable
pleasure
smokie
he
called
again
smokie
you
black
mystery
what
is
it
excites
you
so
again
the
cat
looked
up
at
him
for
a
brief
second
and
then
continued
its
sentry-walk
blissfully
happy
intensely
preoccupied
and
for
an
instant
as
he
watched
it
the
doctor
was
aware
that
a
faint
uneasiness
stirred
in
the
depths
of
his
own
being
focusing
itself
for
the
moment
upon
this
curious
behaviour
of
the
uncanny
creature
before
him
there
rose
in
him
quite
a
new
realisation
of
the
mystery
connected
with
the
whole
feline
tribe
but
especially
with
that
common
member
of
it
the
domestic
cat--their
hidden
lives
their
strange
aloofness
their
incalculable
subtlety
how
utterly
remote
from
anything
that
human
beings
understood
lay
the
sources
of
their
elusive
activities
as
he
watched
the
indescribable
bearing
of
the
little
creature
mincing
along
the
strip
of
carpet
under
his
eyes
coquetting
with
the
powers
of
darkness
welcoming
maybe
some
fearsome
visitor
there
stirred
in
his
heart
a
feeling
strangely
akin
to
awe
its
indifference
to
human
kind
its
serene
superiority
to
the
obvious
struck
him
forcibly
with
fresh
meaning
so
remote
so
inaccessible
seemed
the
secret
purposes
of
its
real
life
so
alien
to
the
blundering
honesty
of
other
animals
its
absolute
poise
of
bearing
brought
into
his
mind
the
opium-eater's
words
that
no
dignity
is
perfect
which
does
not
at
some
point
ally
itself
with
the
mysterious
and
he
became
suddenly
aware
that
the
presence
of
the
dog
in
this
foggy
haunted
room
on
the
top
of
putney
hill
was
uncommonly
welcome
to
him
he
was
glad
to
feel
that
flame's
dependable
personality
was
with
him
the
savage
growling
at
his
heels
was
a
pleasant
sound
he
was
glad
to
hear
it
that
marching
cat
made
him
uneasy
finding
that
smoke
paid
no
further
attention
to
his
words
the
doctor
decided
upon
action
would
it
rub
against
his
leg
too
he
would
take
it
by
surprise
and
see
he
stepped
quickly
forward
and
placed
himself
upon
the
exact
strip
of
carpet
where
it
walked
but
no
cat
is
ever
taken
by
surprise
the
moment
he
occupied
the
space
of
the
intruder
setting
his
feet
on
the
woven
roses
midway
in
the
line
of
travel
smoke
suddenly
stopped
purring
and
sat
down
if
lifted
up
its
face
with
the
most
innocent
stare
imaginable
of
its
green
eyes
he
could
have
sworn
it
laughed
it
was
a
perfect
child
again
in
a
single
second
it
had
resumed
its
simple
domestic
manner
and
it
gazed
at
him
in
such
a
way
that
he
almost
felt
smoke
was
the
normal
being
and
his
was
the
eccentric
behaviour
that
was
being
watched
it
was
consummate
the
manner
in
which
it
brought
about
this
change
so
easily
and
so
quickly
superb
little
actor
he
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
and
stooped
to
stroke
the
shining
black
back
but
in
a
flash
as
he
touched
its
fur
the
cat
turned
and
spat
at
him
viciously
striking
at
his
hand
with
one
paw
then
with
a
hurried
scutter
of
feet
it
shot
like
a
shadow
across
the
floor
and
a
moment
later
was
calmly
sitting
over
by
the
window-curtains
washing
its
face
as
though
nothing
interested
it
in
the
whole
world
but
the
cleanness
of
its
cheeks
and
whiskers
john
silence
straightened
himself
up
and
drew
a
long
breath
he
realised
that
the
performance
was
temporarily
at
an
end
the
collie
meanwhile
who
had
watched
the
whole
proceeding
with
marked
disapproval
had
now
lain
down
again
upon
the
mat
by
the
fire
no
longer
growling
it
seemed
to
the
doctor
just
as
though
something
that
had
entered
the
room
while
he
slept
alarming
the
dog
yet
bringing
happiness
to
the
cat
had
now
gone
out
again
leaving
all
as
it
was
before
whatever
it
was
that
excited
its
blissful
attentions
had
retreated
for
the
moment
he
realised
this
intuitively
smoke
evidently
realised
it
too
for
presently
he
deigned
to
march
back
to
the
fireplace
and
jump
upon
his
master's
knees
dr
silence
patient
and
determined
settled
down
once
more
to
his
book
the
animals
soon
slept
the
fire
blazed
cheerfully
and
the
cold
fog
from
outside
poured
into
the
room
through
every
available
chink
and
crannie
for
a
long
time
silence
and
peace
reigned
in
the
room
and
dr
silence
availed
himself
of
the
quietness
to
make
careful
notes
of
what
had
happened
he
entered
for
future
use
in
other
cases
an
exhaustive
analysis
of
what
he
had
observed
especially
with
regard
to
the
effect
upon
the
two
animals
it
is
impossible
here
nor
would
it
be
intelligible
to
the
reader
unversed
in
the
knowledge
of
the
region
known
to
a
scientifically
trained
psychic
like
dr
silence
to
detail
these
observations
but
to
him
it
was
clear
up
to
a
certain
point--for
the
rest
he
must
still
wait
and
watch
so
far
at
least
he
realised
that
while
he
slept
in
the
chair--that
is
while
his
will
was
dormant--the
room
had
suffered
intrusion
from
what
he
recognised
as
an
intensely
active
force
and
might
later
be
forced
to
acknowledge
as
something
more
than
merely
a
blind
force
namely
a
distinct
personality
so
far
it
had
affected
himself
scarcely
at
all
but
had
acted
directly
upon
the
simpler
organisms
of
the
animals
it
stimulated
keenly
the
centres
of
the
cat's
psychic
being
inducing
a
state
of
instant
happiness
intensifying
its
consciousness
probably
in
the
same
way
a
drug
or
stimulant
intensifies
that
of
a
human
being
whereas
it
alarmed
the
less
sensitive
dog
causing
it
to
feel
a
vague
apprehension
and
distress
his
own
sudden
action
and
exhibition
of
energy
had
served
to
disperse
it
temporarily
yet
he
felt
convinced--the
indications
were
not
lacking
even
while
he
sat
there
making
notes--that
it
still
remained
near
to
him
conditionally
if
not
spatially
and
was
as
it
were
gathering
force
for
a
second
attack
and
further
he
intuitively
understood
that
the
relations
between
the
two
animals
had
undergone
a
subtle
change
that
the
cat
had
become
immeasurably
superior
confident
sure
of
itself
in
its
own
peculiar
region
whereas
flame
had
been
weakened
by
an
attack
he
could
not
comprehend
and
knew
not
how
to
reply
to
though
not
yet
afraid
he
was
defiant--ready
to
act
against
a
fear
that
he
felt
to
be
approaching
he
was
no
longer
fatherly
and
protective
towards
the
cat
smoke
held
the
key
to
the
situation
and
both
he
and
the
cat
knew
it
thus
as
the
minutes
passed
john
silence
sat
and
waited
keenly
on
the
alert
wondering
how
soon
the
attack
would
be
renewed
and
at
what
point
it
would
be
diverted
from
the
animals
and
directed
upon
himself
the
book
lay
on
the
floor
beside
him
his
notes
were
complete
with
one
hand
on
the
cat's
fur
and
the
dog's
front
paws
resting
against
his
feet
the
three
of
them
dozed
comfortably
before
the
hot
fire
while
the
night
wore
on
and
the
silence
deepened
towards
midnight
it
was
well
after
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
when
dr
silence
turned
the
lamp
out
and
lighted
the
candle
preparatory
to
going
up
to
bed
then
smoke
suddenly
woke
with
a
loud
sharp
purr
and
sat
up
it
neither
stretched
washed
nor
turned
it
listened
and
the
doctor
watching
it
realised
that
a
certain
indefinable
change
had
come
about
that
very
moment
in
the
room
a
swift
readjustment
of
the
forces
within
the
four
walls
had
taken
place--a
new
disposition
of
their
personal
equations
the
balance
was
destroyed
the
former
harmony
gone
smoke
most
sensitive
of
barometers
had
been
the
first
to
feel
it
but
the
dog
was
not
slow
to
follow
suit
for
on
looking
down
he
noted
that
flame
was
no
longer
asleep
he
was
lying
with
eyes
wide
open
and
that
same
instant
he
sat
up
on
his
great
haunches
and
began
to
growl
dr
silence
was
in
the
act
of
taking
the
matches
to
re-light
the
lamp
when
an
audible
movement
in
the
room
behind
him
made
him
pause
smoke
leaped
down
from
his
knee
and
moved
forward
a
few
paces
across
the
carpet
then
it
stopped
and
stared
fixedly
and
the
doctor
stood
up
on
the
rug
to
watch
as
he
rose
the
sound
was
repeated
and
he
discovered
that
it
was
not
in
the
room
as
he
first
thought
but
outside
and
that
it
came
from
more
directions
than
one
there
was
a
rushing
sweeping
noise
against
the
window-panes
and
simultaneously
a
sound
of
something
brushing
against
the
door--out
in
the
hall
smoke
advanced
sedately
across
the
carpet
twitching
his
tail
and
sat
down
within
a
foot
of
the
door
the
influence
that
had
destroyed
the
harmonious
conditions
of
the
room
had
apparently
moved
in
advance
of
its
cause
clearly
something
was
about
to
happen
for
the
first
time
that
night
john
silence
hesitated
the
thought
of
that
dark
narrow
hall-way
choked
with
fog
and
destitute
of
human
comfort
was
unpleasant
he
became
aware
of
a
faint
creeping
of
his
flesh
he
knew
of
course
that
the
actual
opening
of
the
door
was
not
necessary
to
the
invasion
of
the
room
that
was
about
to
take
place
since
neither
doors
nor
windows
nor
any
other
solid
barriers
could
interpose
an
obstacle
to
what
was
seeking
entrance
yet
the
opening
of
the
door
would
be
significant
and
symbolic
and
he
distinctly
shrank
from
it
but
for
a
moment
only
smoke
turning
with
a
show
of
impatience
recalled
him
to
his
purpose
and
he
moved
past
the
sitting
watching
creature
and
deliberately
opened
the
door
to
its
full
width
what
subsequently
happened
happened
in
the
feeble
and
flickering
light
of
the
solitary
candle
on
the
mantlepiece
through
the
opened
door
he
saw
the
hall
dimly
lit
and
thick
with
fog
nothing
of
course
was
visible--nothing
but
the
hat-stand
the
african
spears
in
dark
lines
upon
the
wall
and
the
high-backed
wooden
chair
standing
grotesquely
underneath
on
the
oilcloth
floor
for
one
instant
the
fog
seemed
to
move
and
thicken
oddly
but
he
set
that
down
to
the
score
of
the
imagination
the
door
had
opened
upon
nothing
yet
smoke
apparently
thought
otherwise
and
the
deep
growling
of
the
collie
from
the
mat
at
the
back
of
the
room
seemed
to
confirm
his
judgment
for
proud
and
self-possessed
the
cat
had
again
risen
to
his
feet
and
having
advanced
to
the
door
was
now
ushering
some
one
slowly
into
the
room
nothing
could
have
been
more
evident
he
paced
from
side
to
side
bowing
his
little
head
with
great
empressement
and
holding
his
stiffened
tail
aloft
like
a
flag-staff
he
turned
this
way
and
that
mincing
to
and
fro
and
showing
signs
of
supreme
satisfaction
he
was
in
his
element
he
welcomed
the
intrusion
and
apparently
reckoned
that
his
companions
the
doctor
and
the
dog
would
welcome
it
likewise
the
intruder
had
returned
for
a
second
attack
dr
silence
moved
slowly
backwards
and
took
up
his
position
on
the
hearthrug
keying
himself
up
to
a
condition
of
concentrated
attention
he
noted
that
flame
stood
beside
him
facing
the
room
with
body
motionless
and
head
moving
swiftly
from
side
to
side
with
a
curious
swaying
movement
his
eyes
were
wide
open
his
back
rigid
his
neck
and
jaws
thrust
forward
his
legs
tense
and
ready
to
leap
savage
ready
for
attack
or
defence
yet
dreadfully
puzzled
and
perhaps
already
a
little
cowed
he
stood
and
stared
the
hair
on
his
spine
and
sides
positively
bristling
outwards
as
though
a
wind
played
through
it
in
the
dim
firelight
he
looked
like
a
great
yellow-haired
wolf
silent
eyes
shooting
dark
fire
exceedingly
formidable
it
was
flame
the
terrible
smoke
meanwhile
advanced
from
the
door
towards
the
middle
of
the
room
adopting
the
very
slow
pace
of
an
invisible
companion
a
few
feet
away
it
stopped
and
began
to
smile
and
blink
its
eyes
there
was
something
deliberately
coaxing
in
its
attitude
as
it
stood
there
undecided
on
the
carpet
clearly
wishing
to
effect
some
sort
of
introduction
between
the
intruder
and
its
canine
friend
and
ally
it
assumed
its
most
winning
manners
purring
smiling
looking
persuasively
from
one
to
the
other
and
making
quick
tentative
steps
first
in
one
direction
and
then
in
the
other
there
had
always
existed
such
perfect
understanding
between
them
in
everything
surely
flame
would
appreciate
smoke's
intention
now
and
acquiesce
but
the
old
collie
made
no
advances
he
bared
his
teeth
lifting
his
lips
till
the
gums
showed
and
stood
stockstill
with
fixed
eyes
and
heaving
sides
the
doctor
moved
a
little
farther
back
watching
intently
the
smallest
movement
and
it
was
just
then
he
divined
suddenly
from
the
cat's
behaviour
and
attitude
that
it
was
not
only
a
single
companion
it
had
ushered
into
the
room
but
several
it
kept
crossing
over
from
one
to
the
other
looking
up
at
each
in
turn
it
sought
to
win
over
the
dog
to
friendliness
with
them
all
the
original
intruder
had
come
back
with
reinforcements
and
at
the
same
time
he
further
realised
that
the
intruder
was
something
more
than
a
blindly
acting
force
impersonal
though
destructive
it
was
a
personality
and
moreover
a
great
personality
and
it
was
accompanied
for
the
purposes
of
assistance
by
a
host
of
other
personalities
minor
in
degree
but
similar
in
kind
he
braced
himself
in
the
corner
against
the
mantelpiece
and
waited
his
whole
being
roused
to
defence
for
he
was
now
fully
aware
that
the
attack
had
spread
to
include
himself
as
well
as
the
animals
and
he
must
be
on
the
alert
he
strained
his
eyes
through
the
foggy
atmosphere
trying
in
vain
to
see
what
the
cat
and
dog
saw
but
the
candlelight
threw
an
uncertain
and
flickering
light
across
the
room
and
his
eyes
discerned
nothing
on
the
floor
smoke
moved
softly
in
front
of
him
like
a
black
shadow
his
eyes
gleaming
as
he
turned
his
head
still
trying
with
many
insinuating
gestures
and
much
purring
to
bring
about
the
introductions
he
desired
but
it
was
all
in
vain
flame
stood
riveted
to
one
spot
motionless
as
a
figure
carved
in
stone
some
minutes
passed
during
which
only
the
cat
moved
and
then
there
came
a
sharp
change
flame
began
to
back
towards
the
wall
he
moved
his
head
from
side
to
side
as
he
went
sometimes
turning
to
snap
at
something
almost
behind
him
they
were
advancing
upon
him
trying
to
surround
him
his
distress
became
very
marked
from
now
onwards
and
it
seemed
to
the
doctor
that
his
anger
merged
into
genuine
terror
and
became
overwhelmed
by
it
the
savage
growl
sounded
perilously
like
a
whine
and
more
than
once
he
tried
to
dive
past
his
master's
legs
as
though
hunting
for
a
way
of
escape
he
was
trying
to
avoid
something
that
everywhere
blocked
the
way
this
terror
of
the
indomitable
fighter
impressed
the
doctor
enormously
yet
also
painfully
stirring
his
impatience
for
he
had
never
before
seen
the
dog
show
signs
of
giving
in
and
it
distressed
him
to
witness
it
he
knew
however
that
he
was
not
giving
in
easily
and
understood
that
it
was
really
impossible
for
him
to
gauge
the
animal's
sensations
properly
at
all
what
flame
felt
and
saw
must
be
terrible
indeed
to
turn
him
all
at
once
into
a
coward
he
faced
something
that
made
him
afraid
of
more
than
his
life
merely
the
doctor
spoke
a
few
quick
words
of
encouragement
to
him
and
stroked
the
bristling
hair
but
without
much
success
the
collie
seemed
already
beyond
the
reach
of
comfort
such
as
that
and
the
collapse
of
the
old
dog
followed
indeed
very
speedily
after
this
and
smoke
meanwhile
remained
behind
watching
the
advance
but
not
joining
in
it
sitting
pleased
and
expectant
considering
that
all
was
going
well
and
as
it
wished
it
was
kneading
on
the
carpet
with
its
front
paws--slowly
laboriously
as
though
its
feet
were
dipped
in
treacle
the
sound
its
claws
made
as
they
caught
in
the
threads
was
distinctly
audible
it
was
still
smiling
blinking
purring
suddenly
the
collie
uttered
a
poignant
short
bark
and
leaped
heavily
to
one
side
his
bared
teeth
traced
a
line
of
whiteness
through
the
gloom
the
next
instant
he
dashed
past
his
master's
legs
almost
upsetting
his
balance
and
shot
out
into
the
room
where
he
went
blundering
wildly
against
walls
and
furniture
but
that
bark
was
significant
the
doctor
had
heard
it
before
and
knew
what
it
meant
for
it
was
the
cry
of
the
fighter
against
odds
and
it
meant
that
the
old
beast
had
found
his
courage
again
possibly
it
was
only
the
courage
of
despair
but
at
any
rate
the
fighting
would
be
terrific
and
dr
silence
understood
too
that
he
dared
not
interfere
flame
must
fight
his
own
enemies
in
his
own
way
but
the
cat
too
had
heard
that
dreadful
bark
and
it
too
had
understood
this
was
more
than
it
had
bargained
for
across
the
dim
shadows
of
that
haunted
room
there
must
have
passed
some
secret
signal
of
distress
between
the
animals
smoke
stood
up
and
looked
swiftly
about
him
he
uttered
a
piteous
meow
and
trotted
smartly
away
into
the
greater
darkness
by
the
windows
what
his
object
was
only
those
endowed
with
the
spirit-like
intelligence
of
cats
might
know
but
at
any
rate
he
had
at
last
ranged
himself
on
the
side
of
his
friend
and
the
little
beast
meant
business
at
the
same
moment
the
collie
managed
to
gain
the
door
the
doctor
saw
him
rush
through
into
the
hall
like
a
flash
of
yellow
light
he
shot
across
the
oilcloth
and
tore
up
the
stairs
but
in
another
second
he
appeared
again
flying
down
the
steps
and
landing
at
the
bottom
in
a
tumbling
heap
whining
cringing
terrified
the
doctor
saw
him
slink
back
into
the
room
again
and
crawl
round
by
the
wall
towards
the
cat
was
then
even
the
staircase
occupied
did
they
stand
also
in
the
hall
was
the
whole
house
crowded
from
floor
to
ceiling
the
thought
came
to
add
to
the
keen
distress
he
felt
at
the
sight
of
the
collie's
discomfiture
and
indeed
his
own
personal
distress
had
increased
in
a
marked
degree
during
the
past
minutes
and
continued
to
increase
steadily
to
the
climax
he
recognised
that
the
drain
on
his
own
vitality
grew
steadily
and
that
the
attack
was
now
directed
against
himself
even
more
than
against
the
defeated
dog
and
the
too
much
deceived
cat
it
all
seemed
so
rapid
and
uncalculated
after
that--the
events
that
took
place
in
this
little
modern
room
at
the
top
of
putney
hill
between
midnight
and
sunrise--that
dr
silence
was
hardly
able
to
follow
and
remember
it
all
it
came
about
with
such
uncanny
swiftness
and
terror
the
light
was
so
uncertain
the
movements
of
the
black
cat
so
difficult
to
follow
on
the
dark
carpet
and
the
doctor
himself
so
weary
and
taken
by
surprise--that
he
found
it
almost
impossible
to
observe
accurately
or
to
recall
afterwards
precisely
what
it
was
he
had
seen
or
in
what
order
the
incidents
had
taken
place
he
never
could
understand
what
defect
of
vision
on
his
part
made
it
seem
as
though
the
cat
had
duplicated
itself
at
first
and
then
increased
indefinitely
so
that
there
were
at
least
a
dozen
of
them
darting
silently
about
the
floor
leaping
softly
on
to
chairs
and
tables
passing
like
shadows
from
the
open
door
to
the
end
of
the
room
all
black
as
sin
with
brilliant
green
eyes
flashing
fire
in
all
directions
it
was
like
the
reflections
from
a
score
of
mirrors
placed
round
the
walls
at
different
angles
nor
could
he
make
out
at
the
time
why
the
size
of
the
room
seemed
to
have
altered
grown
much
larger
and
why
it
extended
away
behind
him
where
ordinarily
the
wall
should
have
been
the
snarling
of
the
enraged
and
terrified
collie
sounded
sometimes
so
far
away
the
ceiling
seemed
to
have
raised
itself
so
much
higher
than
before
and
much
of
the
furniture
had
changed
in
appearance
and
shifted
marvellously
it
was
all
so
confused
and
confusing
as
though
the
little
room
he
knew
had
become
merged
and
transformed
into
the
dimensions
of
quite
another
chamber
that
came
to
him
with
its
host
of
cats
and
its
strange
distances
in
a
sort
of
vision
but
these
changes
came
about
a
little
later
and
at
a
time
when
his
attention
was
so
concentrated
upon
the
proceedings
of
smoke
and
the
collie
that
he
only
observed
them
as
it
were
subconsciously
and
the
excitement
the
flickering
candlelight
the
distress
he
felt
for
the
collie
and
the
distorting
atmosphere
of
fog
were
the
poorest
possible
allies
to
careful
observation
at
first
he
was
only
aware
that
the
dog
was
repeating
his
short
dangerous
bark
from
time
to
time
snapping
viciously
at
the
empty
air
a
foot
or
so
from
the
ground
once
indeed
he
sprang
upwards
and
forwards
working
furiously
with
teeth
and
paws
and
with
a
noise
like
wolves
fighting
but
only
to
dash
back
the
next
minute
against
the
wall
behind
him
then
after
lying
still
for
a
bit
he
rose
to
a
crouching
position
as
though
to
spring
again
snarling
horribly
and
making
short
half-circles
with
lowered
head
and
smoke
all
the
while
meowed
piteously
by
the
window
as
though
trying
to
draw
the
attack
upon
himself
then
it
was
that
the
rush
of
the
whole
dreadful
business
seemed
to
turn
aside
from
the
dog
and
direct
itself
upon
his
own
person
the
collie
had
made
another
spring
and
fallen
back
with
a
crash
into
the
corner
where
he
made
noise
enough
in
his
savage
rage
to
waken
the
dead
before
he
fell
to
whining
and
then
finally
lay
still
and
directly
afterwards
the
doctor's
own
distress
became
intolerably
acute
he
had
made
a
half
movement
forward
to
come
to
the
rescue
when
a
veil
that
was
denser
than
mere
fog
seemed
to
drop
down
over
the
scene
draping
room
walls
animals
and
fire
in
a
mist
of
darkness
and
folding
also
about
his
own
mind
other
forms
moved
silently
across
the
field
of
vision
forms
that
he
recognised
from
previous
experiments
and
welcomed
not
unholy
thoughts
began
to
crowd
into
his
brain
sinister
suggestions
of
evil
presented
themselves
seductively
ice
seemed
to
settle
about
his
heart
and
his
mind
trembled
he
began
to
lose
memory--memory
of
his
identity
of
where
he
was
of
what
he
ought
to
do
the
very
foundations
of
his
strength
were
shaken
his
will
seemed
paralysed
and
it
was
then
that
the
room
filled
with
this
horde
of
cats
all
dark
as
the
night
all
silent
all
with
lamping
eyes
of
green
fire
the
dimensions
of
the
place
altered
and
shifted
he
was
in
a
much
larger
space
the
whining
of
the
dog
sounded
far
away
and
all
about
him
the
cats
flew
busily
to
and
fro
silently
playing
their
tearing
rushing
game
of
evil
weaving
the
pattern
of
their
dark
purpose
upon
the
floor
he
strove
hard
to
collect
himself
and
remember
the
words
of
power
he
had
made
use
of
before
in
similar
dread
positions
where
his
dangerous
practice
had
sometimes
led
but
he
could
recall
nothing
consecutively
a
mist
lay
over
his
mind
and
memory
he
felt
dazed
and
his
forces
scattered
the
deeps
within
were
too
troubled
for
healing
power
to
come
out
of
them
it
was
glamour
of
course
he
realised
afterwards
the
strong
glamour
thrown
upon
his
imagination
by
some
powerful
personality
behind
the
veil
but
at
the
time
he
was
not
sufficiently
aware
of
this
and
as
with
all
true
glamour
was
unable
to
grasp
where
the
true
ended
and
the
false
began
he
was
caught
momentarily
in
the
same
vortex
that
had
sought
to
lure
the
cat
to
destruction
through
its
delight
and
threatened
utterly
to
overwhelm
the
dog
through
its
terror
there
came
a
sound
in
the
chimney
behind
him
like
wind
booming
and
tearing
its
way
down
the
windows
rattled
the
candle
flickered
and
went
out
the
glacial
atmosphere
closed
round
him
with
the
cold
of
death
and
a
great
rushing
sound
swept
by
overhead
as
though
the
ceiling
had
lifted
to
a
great
height
he
heard
the
door
shut
far
away
it
sounded
he
felt
lost
shelterless
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
yet
still
he
held
out
and
resisted
while
the
climax
of
the
fight
came
nearer
and
nearer
he
had
stepped
into
the
stream
of
forces
awakened
by
pender
and
he
knew
that
he
must
withstand
them
to
the
end
or
come
to
a
conclusion
that
it
was
not
good
for
a
man
to
come
to
something
from
the
region
of
utter
cold
was
upon
him
and
then
quite
suddenly
through
the
confused
mists
about
him
there
slowly
rose
up
the
personality
that
had
been
all
the
time
directing
the
battle
some
force
entered
his
being
that
shook
him
as
the
tempest
shakes
a
leaf
and
close
against
his
eyes--clean
level
with
his
face--he
found
himself
staring
into
the
wreck
of
a
vast
dark
countenance
a
countenance
that
was
terrible
even
in
its
ruin
for
ruined
it
was
and
terrible
it
was
and
the
mark
of
spiritual
evil
was
branded
everywhere
upon
its
broken
features
eyes
face
and
hair
rose
level
with
his
own
and
for
a
space
of
time
he
never
could
properly
measure
or
determine
these
two
a
man
and
a
woman
looked
straight
into
each
other's
visages
and
down
into
each
other's
hearts
and
john
silence
the
soul
with
the
good
unselfish
motive
held
his
own
against
the
dark
discarnate
woman
whose
motive
was
pure
evil
and
whose
soul
was
on
the
side
of
the
dark
powers
it
was
the
climax
that
touched
the
depth
of
power
within
him
and
began
to
restore
him
slowly
to
his
own
he
was
conscious
of
course
of
effort
and
yet
it
seemed
no
superhuman
one
for
he
had
recognised
the
character
of
his
opponent's
power
and
he
called
upon
the
good
within
him
to
meet
and
overcome
it
the
inner
forces
stirred
and
trembled
in
response
to
his
call
they
did
not
at
first
come
readily
as
was
their
habit
for
under
the
spell
of
glamour
they
had
already
been
diabolically
lulled
into
inactivity
but
come
they
eventually
did
rising
out
of
the
inner
spiritual
nature
he
had
learned
with
so
much
time
and
pain
to
awaken
to
life
and
power
and
confidence
came
with
them
he
began
to
breathe
deeply
and
regularly
and
at
the
same
time
to
absorb
into
himself
the
forces
opposed
to
him
and
to
turn
them
to
his
own
account
by
ceasing
to
resist
and
allowing
the
deadly
stream
to
pour
into
him
unopposed
he
used
the
very
power
supplied
by
his
adversary
and
thus
enormously
increased
his
own
for
this
spiritual
alchemy
he
had
learned
he
understood
that
force
ultimately
is
everywhere
one
and
the
same
it
is
the
motive
behind
that
makes
it
good
or
evil
and
his
motive
was
entirely
unselfish
he
knew--provided
he
was
not
first
robbed
of
self-control--how
vicariously
to
absorb
these
evil
radiations
into
himself
and
change
them
magically
into
his
own
good
purposes
and
since
his
motive
was
pure
and
his
soul
fearless
they
could
not
work
him
harm
thus
he
stood
in
the
main
stream
of
evil
unwittingly
attracted
by
pender
deflecting
its
course
upon
himself
and
after
passing
through
the
purifying
filter
of
his
own
unselfishness
these
energies
could
only
add
to
his
store
of
experience
of
knowledge
and
therefore
of
power
and
as
his
self-control
returned
to
him
he
gradually
accomplished
this
purpose
even
though
trembling
while
he
did
so
yet
the
struggle
was
severe
and
in
spite
of
the
freezing
chill
of
the
air
the
perspiration
poured
down
his
face
then
by
slow
degrees
the
dark
and
dreadful
countenance
faded
the
glamour
passed
from
his
soul
the
normal
proportions
returned
to
walls
and
ceiling
the
forms
melted
back
into
the
fog
and
the
whirl
of
rushing
shadow-cats
disappeared
whence
they
came
and
with
the
return
of
the
consciousness
of
his
own
identity
john
silence
was
restored
to
the
full
control
of
his
own
will-power
in
a
deep
modulated
voice
he
began
to
utter
certain
rhythmical
sounds
that
slowly
rolled
through
the
air
like
a
rising
sea
filling
the
room
with
powerful
vibratory
activities
that
whelmed
all
irregularities
of
lesser
vibrations
in
its
own
swelling
tone
he
made
certain
sigils
gestures
and
movements
at
the
same
time
for
several
minutes
he
continued
to
utter
these
words
until
at
length
the
growing
volume
dominated
the
whole
room
and
mastered
the
manifestation
of
all
that
opposed
it
for
just
as
he
understood
the
spiritual
alchemy
that
can
transmute
evil
forces
by
raising
them
into
higher
channels
so
he
knew
from
long
study
the
occult
use
of
sound
and
its
direct
effect
upon
the
plastic
region
wherein
the
powers
of
spiritual
evil
work
their
fell
purposes
harmony
was
restored
first
of
all
to
his
own
soul
and
thence
to
the
room
and
all
its
occupants
and
after
himself
the
first
to
recognise
it
was
the
old
dog
lying
in
his
corner
flame
began
suddenly
uttering
sounds
of
pleasure
that
something
between
a
growl
and
a
grunt
that
dogs
make
upon
being
restored
to
their
master's
confidence
dr
silence
heard
the
thumping
of
the
collie's
tail
against
the
floor
and
the
grunt
and
the
thumping
touched
the
depth
of
affection
in
the
man's
heart
and
gave
him
some
inkling
of
what
agonies
the
dumb
creature
had
suffered
next
from
the
shadows
by
the
window
a
somewhat
shrill
purring
announced
the
restoration
of
the
cat
to
its
normal
state
smoke
was
advancing
across
the
carpet
he
seemed
very
pleased
with
himself
and
smiled
with
an
expression
of
supreme
innocence
he
was
no
shadow-cat
but
real
and
full
of
his
usual
and
perfect
self-possession
he
marched
along
picking
his
way
delicately
but
with
a
stately
dignity
that
suggested
his
ancestry
with
the
majesty
of
egypt
his
eyes
no
longer
glared
they
shone
steadily
before
him
they
radiated
not
excitement
but
knowledge
clearly
he
was
anxious
to
make
amends
for
the
mischief
to
which
he
had
unwittingly
lent
himself
owing
to
his
subtle
and
electric
constitution
still
uttering
his
sharp
high
purrings
he
marched
up
to
his
master
and
rubbed
vigorously
against
his
legs
then
he
stood
on
his
hind
feet
and
pawed
his
knees
and
stared
beseechingly
up
into
his
face
he
turned
his
head
towards
the
corner
where
the
collie
still
lay
thumping
his
tail
feebly
and
pathetically
john
silence
understood
he
bent
down
and
stroked
the
creature's
living
fur
noting
the
line
of
bright
blue
sparks
that
followed
the
motion
of
his
hand
down
its
back
and
then
they
advanced
together
towards
the
corner
where
the
dog
was
smoke
went
first
and
put
his
nose
gently
against
his
friend's
muzzle
purring
while
he
rubbed
and
uttering
little
soft
sounds
of
affection
in
his
throat
the
doctor
lit
the
candle
and
brought
it
over
he
saw
the
collie
lying
on
its
side
against
the
wall
it
was
utterly
exhausted
and
foam
still
hung
about
its
jaws
its
tail
and
eyes
responded
to
the
sound
of
its
name
but
it
was
evidently
very
weak
and
overcome
smoke
continued
to
rub
against
its
cheek
and
nose
and
eyes
sometimes
even
standing
on
its
body
and
kneading
into
the
thick
yellow
hair
flame
replied
from
time
to
time
by
little
licks
of
the
tongue
most
of
them
curiously
misdirected
but
dr
silence
felt
intuitively
that
something
disastrous
had
happened
and
his
heart
was
wrung
he
stroked
the
dear
body
feeling
it
over
for
bruises
or
broken
bones
but
finding
none
he
fed
it
with
what
remained
of
the
sandwiches
and
milk
but
the
creature
clumsily
upset
the
saucer
and
lost
the
sandwiches
between
its
paws
so
that
the
doctor
had
to
feed
it
with
his
own
hand
and
all
the
while
smoke
meowed
piteously
then
john
silence
began
to
understand
he
went
across
to
the
farther
side
of
the
room
and
called
aloud
to
it
flame
old
man
come
at
any
other
time
the
dog
would
have
been
upon
him
in
an
instant
barking
and
leaping
to
the
shoulder
and
even
now
he
got
up
though
heavily
and
awkwardly
to
his
feet
he
started
to
run
wagging
his
tail
more
briskly
he
collided
first
with
a
chair
and
then
ran
straight
into
a
table
smoke
trotted
close
at
his
side
trying
his
very
best
to
guide
him
but
it
was
useless
dr
silence
had
to
lift
him
up
into
his
own
arms
and
carry
him
like
a
baby
for
he
was
blind
iii
it
was
a
week
later
when
john
silence
called
to
see
the
author
in
his
new
house
and
found
him
well
on
the
way
to
recovery
and
already
busy
again
with
his
writing
the
haunted
look
had
left
his
eyes
and
he
seemed
cheerful
and
confident
humour
restored
laughed
the
doctor
as
soon
as
they
were
comfortably
settled
in
the
room
overlooking
the
park
i've
had
no
trouble
since
i
left
that
dreadful
place
returned
pender
gratefully
and
thanks
to
you--
the
doctor
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
never
mind
that
he
said
we'll
discuss
your
new
plans
afterwards
and
my
scheme
for
relieving
you
of
the
house
and
helping
you
settle
elsewhere
of
course
it
must
be
pulled
down
for
it's
not
fit
for
any
sensitive
person
to
live
in
and
any
other
tenant
might
be
afflicted
in
the
same
way
you
were
although
personally
i
think
the
evil
has
exhausted
itself
by
now
he
told
the
astonished
author
something
of
his
experiences
in
it
with
the
animals
i
don't
pretend
to
understand
pender
said
when
the
account
was
finished
but
i
and
my
wife
are
intensely
relieved
to
be
free
of
it
all
only
i
must
say
i
should
like
to
know
something
of
the
former
history
of
the
house
when
we
took
it
six
months
ago
i
heard
no
word
against
it
dr
silence
drew
a
typewritten
paper
from
his
pocket
i
can
satisfy
your
curiosity
to
some
extent
he
said
running
his
eye
over
the
sheets
and
then
replacing
them
in
his
coat
for
by
my
secretary's
investigations
i
have
been
able
to
check
certain
information
obtained
in
the
hypnotic
trance
by
a
'sensitive'
who
helps
me
in
such
cases
the
former
occupant
who
haunted
you
appears
to
have
been
a
woman
of
singularly
atrocious
life
and
character
who
finally
suffered
death
by
hanging
after
a
series
of
crimes
that
appalled
the
whole
of
england
and
only
came
to
light
by
the
merest
chance
she
came
to
her
end
in
the
year
1798
for
it
was
not
this
particular
house
she
lived
in
but
a
much
larger
one
that
then
stood
upon
the
site
it
now
occupies
and
was
then
of
course
not
in
london
but
in
the
country
she
was
a
person
of
intellect
possessed
of
a
powerful
trained
will
and
of
consummate
audacity
and
i
am
convinced
availed
herself
of
the
resources
of
the
lower
magic
to
attain
her
ends
this
goes
far
to
explain
the
virulence
of
the
attack
upon
yourself
and
why
she
is
still
able
to
carry
on
after
death
the
evil
practices
that
formed
her
main
purpose
during
life
you
think
that
after
death
a
soul
can
still
consciously
direct--
gasped
the
author
i
think
as
i
told
you
before
that
the
forces
of
a
powerful
personality
may
still
persist
after
death
in
the
line
of
their
original
momentum
replied
the
doctor
and
that
strong
thoughts
and
purposes
can
still
react
upon
suitably
prepared
brains
long
after
their
originators
have
passed
away
if
you
knew
anything
of
magic
he
pursued
you
would
know
that
thought
is
dynamic
and
that
it
may
call
into
existence
forms
and
pictures
that
may
well
exist
for
hundreds
of
years
for
not
far
removed
from
the
region
of
our
human
life
is
another
region
where
float
the
waste
and
drift
of
all
the
centuries
the
limbo
of
the
shells
of
the
dead
a
densely
populated
region
crammed
with
horror
and
abomination
of
all
descriptions
and
sometimes
galvanised
into
active
life
again
by
the
will
of
a
trained
manipulator
a
mind
versed
in
the
practices
of
lower
magic
that
this
woman
understood
its
vile
commerce
i
am
persuaded
and
the
forces
she
set
going
during
her
life
have
simply
been
accumulating
ever
since
and
would
have
continued
to
do
so
had
they
not
been
drawn
down
upon
yourself
and
afterwards
discharged
and
satisfied
through
me
anything
might
have
brought
down
the
attack
for
besides
drugs
there
are
certain
violent
emotions
certain
moods
of
the
soul
certain
spiritual
fevers
if
i
may
so
call
them
which
directly
open
the
inner
being
to
a
cognisance
of
this
astral
region
i
have
mentioned
in
your
case
it
happened
to
be
a
peculiarly
potent
drug
that
did
it
but
now
tell
me
he
added
after
a
pause
handing
to
the
perplexed
author
a
pencil
drawing
he
had
made
of
the
dark
countenance
that
had
appeared
to
him
during
the
night
on
putney
hill--tell
me
if
you
recognise
this
face
pender
looked
at
the
drawing
closely
greatly
astonished
he
shuddered
a
little
as
he
looked
undoubtedly
he
said
it
is
the
face
i
kept
trying
to
draw--dark
with
the
great
mouth
and
jaw
and
the
drooping
eye
that
is
the
woman
dr
silence
then
produced
from
his
pocket-book
an
old-fashioned
woodcut
of
the
same
person
which
his
secretary
had
unearthed
from
the
records
of
the
newgate
calendar
the
woodcut
and
the
pencil
drawing
were
two
different
aspects
of
the
same
dreadful
visage
the
men
compared
them
for
some
moments
in
silence
it
makes
me
thank
god
for
the
limitations
of
our
senses
said
pender
quietly
with
a
sigh
continuous
clairvoyance
must
be
a
sore
affliction
it
is
indeed
returned
john
silence
significantly
and
if
all
the
people
nowadays
who
claim
to
be
clairvoyant
were
really
so
the
statistics
of
suicide
and
lunacy
would
be
considerably
higher
than
they
are
it
is
little
wonder
he
added
that
your
sense
of
humour
was
clouded
with
the
mind-forces
of
that
dead
monster
trying
to
use
your
brain
for
their
dissemination
you
have
had
an
interesting
adventure
mr
felix
pender
and
let
me
add
a
fortunate
escape
the
author
was
about
to
renew
his
thanks
when
there
came
a
sound
of
scratching
at
the
door
and
the
doctor
sprang
up
quickly
it's
time
for
me
to
go
i
left
my
dog
on
the
step
but
i
suppose--
before
he
had
time
to
open
the
door
it
had
yielded
to
the
pressure
behind
it
and
flew
wide
open
to
admit
a
great
yellow-haired
collie
the
dog
wagging
his
tail
and
contorting
his
whole
body
with
delight
tore
across
the
floor
and
tried
to
leap
up
upon
his
owner's
breast
and
there
was
laughter
and
happiness
in
the
old
eyes
for
they
were
clear
again
as
the
day
case
ii
ancient
sorceries
i
there
are
it
would
appear
certain
wholly
unremarkable
persons
with
none
of
the
characteristics
that
invite
adventure
who
yet
once
or
twice
in
the
course
of
their
smooth
lives
undergo
an
experience
so
strange
that
the
world
catches
its
breath--and
looks
the
other
way
and
it
was
cases
of
this
kind
perhaps
more
than
any
other
that
fell
into
the
wide-spread
net
of
john
silence
the
psychic
doctor
and
appealing
to
his
deep
humanity
to
his
patience
and
to
his
great
qualities
of
spiritual
sympathy
led
often
to
the
revelation
of
problems
of
the
strangest
complexity
and
of
the
profoundest
possible
human
interest
matters
that
seemed
almost
too
curious
and
fantastic
for
belief
he
loved
to
trace
to
their
hidden
sources
to
unravel
a
tangle
in
the
very
soul
of
things--and
to
release
a
suffering
human
soul
in
the
process--was
with
him
a
veritable
passion
and
the
knots
he
untied
were
indeed
after
passing
strange
the
world
of
course
asks
for
some
plausible
basis
to
which
it
can
attach
credence--something
it
can
at
least
pretend
to
explain
the
adventurous
type
it
can
understand
such
people
carry
about
with
them
an
adequate
explanation
of
their
exciting
lives
and
their
characters
obviously
drive
them
into
the
circumstances
which
produce
the
adventures
it
expects
nothing
else
from
them
and
is
satisfied
but
dull
ordinary
folk
have
no
right
to
out-of-the-way
experiences
and
the
world
having
been
led
to
expect
otherwise
is
disappointed
with
them
not
to
say
shocked
its
complacent
judgment
has
been
rudely
disturbed
such
a
thing
happened
to
that
man
it
cries--a
commonplace
person
like
that
it
is
too
absurd
there
must
be
something
wrong
yet
there
could
be
no
question
that
something
did
actually
happen
to
little
arthur
vezin
something
of
the
curious
nature
he
described
to
dr
silence
outwardly
or
inwardly
it
happened
beyond
a
doubt
and
in
spite
of
the
jeers
of
his
few
friends
who
heard
the
tale
and
observed
wisely
that
such
a
thing
might
perhaps
have
come
to
iszard
that
crack-brained
iszard
or
to
that
odd
fish
minski
but
it
could
never
have
happened
to
commonplace
little
vezin
who
was
fore-ordained
to
live
and
die
according
to
scale
but
whatever
his
method
of
death
was
vezin
certainly
did
not
live
according
to
scale
so
far
as
this
particular
event
in
his
otherwise
uneventful
life
was
concerned
and
to
hear
him
recount
it
and
watch
his
pale
delicate
features
change
and
hear
his
voice
grow
softer
and
more
hushed
as
he
proceeded
was
to
know
the
conviction
that
his
halting
words
perhaps
failed
sometimes
to
convey
he
lived
the
thing
over
again
each
time
he
told
it
his
whole
personality
became
muffled
in
the
recital
it
subdued
him
more
than
ever
so
that
the
tale
became
a
lengthy
apology
for
an
experience
that
he
deprecated
he
appeared
to
excuse
himself
and
ask
your
pardon
for
having
dared
to
take
part
in
so
fantastic
an
episode
for
little
vezin
was
a
timid
gentle
sensitive
soul
rarely
able
to
assert
himself
tender
to
man
and
beast
and
almost
constitutionally
unable
to
say
no
or
to
claim
many
things
that
should
rightly
have
been
his
his
whole
scheme
of
life
seemed
utterly
remote
from
anything
more
exciting
than
missing
a
train
or
losing
an
umbrella
on
an
omnibus
and
when
this
curious
event
came
upon
him
he
was
already
more
years
beyond
forty
than
his
friends
suspected
or
he
cared
to
admit
john
silence
who
heard
him
speak
of
his
experience
more
than
once
said
that
he
sometimes
left
out
certain
details
and
put
in
others
yet
they
were
all
obviously
true
the
whole
scene
was
unforgettably
cinematographed
on
to
his
mind
none
of
the
details
were
imagined
or
invented
and
when
he
told
the
story
with
them
all
complete
the
effect
was
undeniable
his
appealing
brown
eyes
shone
and
much
of
the
charming
personality
usually
so
carefully
repressed
came
forward
and
revealed
itself
his
modesty
was
always
there
of
course
but
in
the
telling
he
forgot
the
present
and
allowed
himself
to
appear
almost
vividly
as
he
lived
again
in
the
past
of
his
adventure
he
was
on
the
way
home
when
it
happened
crossing
northern
france
from
some
mountain
trip
or
other
where
he
buried
himself
solitary-wise
every
summer
he
had
nothing
but
an
unregistered
bag
in
the
rack
and
the
train
was
jammed
to
suffocation
most
of
the
passengers
being
unredeemed
holiday
english
he
disliked
them
not
because
they
were
his
fellow-countrymen
but
because
they
were
noisy
and
obtrusive
obliterating
with
their
big
limbs
and
tweed
clothing
all
the
quieter
tints
of
the
day
that
brought
him
satisfaction
and
enabled
him
to
melt
into
insignificance
and
forget
that
he
was
anybody
these
english
clashed
about
him
like
a
brass
band
making
him
feel
vaguely
that
he
ought
to
be
more
self-assertive
and
obstreperous
and
that
he
did
not
claim
insistently
enough
all
kinds
of
things
that
he
didn't
want
and
that
were
really
valueless
such
as
corner
seats
windows
up
or
down
and
so
forth
so
that
he
felt
uncomfortable
in
the
train
and
wished
the
journey
were
over
and
he
was
back
again
living
with
his
unmarried
sister
in
surbiton
and
when
the
train
stopped
for
ten
panting
minutes
at
the
little
station
in
northern
france
and
he
got
out
to
stretch
his
legs
on
the
platform
and
saw
to
his
dismay
a
further
batch
of
the
british
isles
debouching
from
another
train
it
suddenly
seemed
impossible
to
him
to
continue
the
journey
even
his
flabby
soul
revolted
and
the
idea
of
staying
a
night
in
the
little
town
and
going
on
next
day
by
a
slower
emptier
train
flashed
into
his
mind
the
guard
was
already
shouting
en
voiture
and
the
corridor
of
his
compartment
was
already
packed
when
the
thought
came
to
him
and
for
once
he
acted
with
decision
and
rushed
to
snatch
his
bag
finding
the
corridor
and
steps
impassable
he
tapped
at
the
window
for
he
had
a
corner
seat
and
begged
the
frenchman
who
sat
opposite
to
hand
his
luggage
out
to
him
explaining
in
his
wretched
french
that
he
intended
to
break
the
journey
there
and
this
elderly
frenchman
he
declared
gave
him
a
look
half
of
warning
half
of
reproach
that
to
his
dying
day
he
could
never
forget
handed
the
bag
through
the
window
of
the
moving
train
and
at
the
same
time
poured
into
his
ears
a
long
sentence
spoken
rapidly
and
low
of
which
he
was
able
to
comprehend
only
the
last
few
words

cause
du
sommeil
et

cause
des
chats
in
reply
to
dr
silence
whose
singular
psychic
acuteness
at
once
seized
upon
this
frenchman
as
a
vital
point
in
the
adventure
vezin
admitted
that
the
man
had
impressed
him
favourably
from
the
beginning
though
without
being
able
to
explain
why
they
had
sat
facing
one
another
during
the
four
hours
of
the
journey
and
though
no
conversation
had
passed
between
them--vezin
was
timid
about
his
stuttering
french--he
confessed
that
his
eyes
were
being
continually
drawn
to
his
face
almost
he
felt
to
rudeness
and
that
each
by
a
dozen
nameless
little
politenesses
and
attentions
had
evinced
the
desire
to
be
kind
the
men
liked
each
other
and
their
personalities
did
not
clash
or
would
not
have
clashed
had
they
chanced
to
come
to
terms
of
acquaintance
the
frenchman
indeed
seemed
to
have
exercised
a
silent
protective
influence
over
the
insignificant
little
englishman
and
without
words
or
gestures
betrayed
that
he
wished
him
well
and
would
gladly
have
been
of
service
to
him
and
this
sentence
that
he
hurled
at
you
after
the
bag
asked
john
silence
smiling
that
peculiarly
sympathetic
smile
that
always
melted
the
prejudices
of
his
patient
were
you
unable
to
follow
it
exactly
it
was
so
quick
and
low
and
vehement
explained
vezin
in
his
small
voice
that
i
missed
practically
the
whole
of
it
i
only
caught
the
few
words
at
the
very
end
because
he
spoke
them
so
clearly
and
his
face
was
bent
down
out
of
the
carriage
window
so
near
to
mine
'
cause
du
sommeil
et

cause
des
chats'
repeated
dr
silence
as
though
half
speaking
to
himself
that's
it
exactly
said
vezin
which
i
take
it
means
something
like
'because
of
sleep
and
because
of
the
cats'
doesn't
it
certainly
that's
how
i
should
translate
it
the
doctor
observed
shortly
evidently
not
wishing
to
interrupt
more
than
necessary
and
the
rest
of
the
sentence--all
the
first
part
i
couldn't
understand
i
mean--was
a
warning
not
to
do
something--not
to
stop
in
the
town
or
at
some
particular
place
in
the
town
perhaps
that
was
the
impression
it
made
on
me
then
of
course
the
train
rushed
off
and
left
vezin
standing
on
the
platform
alone
and
rather
forlorn
the
little
town
climbed
in
straggling
fashion
up
a
sharp
hill
rising
out
of
the
plain
at
the
back
of
the
station
and
was
crowned
by
the
twin
towers
of
the
ruined
cathedral
peeping
over
the
summit
from
the
station
itself
it
looked
uninteresting
and
modern
but
the
fact
was
that
the
mediaeval
position
lay
out
of
sight
just
beyond
the
crest
and
once
he
reached
the
top
and
entered
the
old
streets
he
stepped
clean
out
of
modern
life
into
a
bygone
century
the
noise
and
bustle
of
the
crowded
train
seemed
days
away
the
spirit
of
this
silent
hill-town
remote
from
tourists
and
motor-cars
dreaming
its
own
quiet
life
under
the
autumn
sun
rose
up
and
cast
its
spell
upon
him
long
before
he
recognised
this
spell
he
acted
under
it
he
walked
softly
almost
on
tiptoe
down
the
winding
narrow
streets
where
the
gables
all
but
met
over
his
head
and
he
entered
the
doorway
of
the
solitary
inn
with
a
deprecating
and
modest
demeanour
that
was
in
itself
an
apology
for
intruding
upon
the
place
and
disturbing
its
dream
at
first
however
vezin
said
he
noticed
very
little
of
all
this
the
attempt
at
analysis
came
much
later
what
struck
him
then
was
only
the
delightful
contrast
of
the
silence
and
peace
after
the
dust
and
noisy
rattle
of
the
train
he
felt
soothed
and
stroked
like
a
cat
like
a
cat
you
said
interrupted
john
silence
quickly
catching
him
up
yes
at
the
very
start
i
felt
that
he
laughed
apologetically
i
felt
as
though
the
warmth
and
the
stillness
and
the
comfort
made
me
purr
it
seemed
to
be
the
general
mood
of
the
whole
place--then
the
inn
a
rambling
ancient
house
the
atmosphere
of
the
old
coaching
days
still
about
it
apparently
did
not
welcome
him
too
warmly
he
felt
he
was
only
tolerated
he
said
but
it
was
cheap
and
comfortable
and
the
delicious
cup
of
afternoon
tea
he
ordered
at
once
made
him
feel
really
very
pleased
with
himself
for
leaving
the
train
in
this
bold
original
way
for
to
him
it
had
seemed
bold
and
original
he
felt
something
of
a
dog
his
room
too
soothed
him
with
its
dark
panelling
and
low
irregular
ceiling
and
the
long
sloping
passage
that
led
to
it
seemed
the
natural
pathway
to
a
real
chamber
of
sleep--a
little
dim
cubby
hole
out
of
the
world
where
noise
could
not
enter
it
looked
upon
the
courtyard
at
the
back
it
was
all
very
charming
and
made
him
think
of
himself
as
dressed
in
very
soft
velvet
somehow
and
the
floors
seemed
padded
the
walls
provided
with
cushions
the
sounds
of
the
streets
could
not
penetrate
there
it
was
an
atmosphere
of
absolute
rest
that
surrounded
him
on
engaging
the
two-franc
room
he
had
interviewed
the
only
person
who
seemed
to
be
about
that
sleepy
afternoon
an
elderly
waiter
with
dundreary
whiskers
and
a
drowsy
courtesy
who
had
ambled
lazily
towards
him
across
the
stone
yard
but
on
coming
downstairs
again
for
a
little
promenade
in
the
town
before
dinner
he
encountered
the
proprietress
herself
she
was
a
large
woman
whose
hands
feet
and
features
seemed
to
swim
towards
him
out
of
a
sea
of
person
they
emerged
so
to
speak
but
she
had
great
dark
vivacious
eyes
that
counteracted
the
bulk
of
her
body
and
betrayed
the
fact
that
in
reality
she
was
both
vigorous
and
alert
when
he
first
caught
sight
of
her
she
was
knitting
in
a
low
chair
against
the
sunlight
of
the
wall
and
something
at
once
made
him
see
her
as
a
great
tabby
cat
dozing
yet
awake
heavily
sleepy
and
yet
at
the
same
time
prepared
for
instantaneous
action
a
great
mouser
on
the
watch
occurred
to
him
she
took
him
in
with
a
single
comprehensive
glance
that
was
polite
without
being
cordial
her
neck
he
noticed
was
extraordinarily
supple
in
spite
of
its
proportions
for
it
turned
so
easily
to
follow
him
and
the
head
it
carried
bowed
so
very
flexibly
but
when
she
looked
at
me
you
know
said
vezin
with
that
little
apologetic
smile
in
his
brown
eyes
and
that
faintly
deprecating
gesture
of
the
shoulders
that
was
characteristic
of
him
the
odd
notion
came
to
me
that
really
she
had
intended
to
make
quite
a
different
movement
and
that
with
a
single
bound
she
could
have
leaped
at
me
across
the
width
of
that
stone
yard
and
pounced
upon
me
like
some
huge
cat
upon
a
mouse
he
laughed
a
little
soft
laugh
and
dr
silence
made
a
note
in
his
book
without
interrupting
while
vezin
proceeded
in
a
tone
as
though
he
feared
he
had
already
told
too
much
and
more
than
we
could
believe
very
soft
yet
very
active
she
was
for
all
her
size
and
mass
and
i
felt
she
knew
what
i
was
doing
even
after
i
had
passed
and
was
behind
her
back
she
spoke
to
me
and
her
voice
was
smooth
and
running
she
asked
if
i
had
my
luggage
and
was
comfortable
in
my
room
and
then
added
that
dinner
was
at
seven
o'clock
and
that
they
were
very
early
people
in
this
little
country
town
clearly
she
intended
to
convey
that
late
hours
were
not
encouraged
evidently
she
contrived
by
voice
and
manner
to
give
him
the
impression
that
here
he
would
be
managed
that
everything
would
be
arranged
and
planned
for
him
and
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
fall
into
the
groove
and
obey
no
decided
action
or
sharp
personal
effort
would
be
looked
for
from
him
it
was
the
very
reverse
of
the
train
he
walked
quietly
out
into
the
street
feeling
soothed
and
peaceful
he
realised
that
he
was
in
a
milieu
that
suited
him
and
stroked
him
the
right
way
it
was
so
much
easier
to
be
obedient
he
began
to
purr
again
and
to
feel
that
all
the
town
purred
with
him
about
the
streets
of
that
little
town
he
meandered
gently
falling
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
spirit
of
repose
that
characterised
it
with
no
special
aim
he
wandered
up
and
down
and
to
and
fro
the
september
sunshine
fell
slantingly
over
the
roofs
down
winding
alleyways
fringed
with
tumbling
gables
and
open
casements
he
caught
fairylike
glimpses
of
the
great
plain
below
and
of
the
meadows
and
yellow
copses
lying
like
a
dream-map
in
the
haze
the
spell
of
the
past
held
very
potently
here
he
felt
the
streets
were
full
of
picturesquely
garbed
men
and
women
all
busy
enough
going
their
respective
ways
but
no
one
took
any
notice
of
him
or
turned
to
stare
at
his
obviously
english
appearance
he
was
even
able
to
forget
that
with
his
tourist
appearance
he
was
a
false
note
in
a
charming
picture
and
he
melted
more
and
more
into
the
scene
feeling
delightfully
insignificant
and
unimportant
and
unselfconscious
it
was
like
becoming
part
of
a
softly
coloured
dream
which
he
did
not
even
realise
to
be
a
dream
on
the
eastern
side
the
hill
fell
away
more
sharply
and
the
plain
below
ran
off
rather
suddenly
into
a
sea
of
gathering
shadows
in
which
the
little
patches
of
woodland
looked
like
islands
and
the
stubble
fields
like
deep
water
here
he
strolled
along
the
old
ramparts
of
ancient
fortifications
that
once
had
been
formidable
but
now
were
only
vision-like
with
their
charming
mingling
of
broken
grey
walls
and
wayward
vine
and
ivy
from
the
broad
coping
on
which
he
sat
for
a
moment
level
with
the
rounded
tops
of
clipped
plane
trees
he
saw
the
esplanade
far
below
lying
in
shadow
here
and
there
a
yellow
sunbeam
crept
in
and
lay
upon
the
fallen
yellow
leaves
and
from
the
height
he
looked
down
and
saw
that
the
townsfolk
were
walking
to
and
fro
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
he
could
just
hear
the
sound
of
their
slow
footfalls
and
the
murmur
of
their
voices
floated
up
to
him
through
the
gaps
between
the
trees
the
figures
looked
like
shadows
as
he
caught
glimpses
of
their
quiet
movements
far
below
he
sat
there
for
some
time
pondering
bathed
in
the
waves
of
murmurs
and
half-lost
echoes
that
rose
to
his
ears
muffled
by
the
leaves
of
the
plane
trees
the
whole
town
and
the
little
hill
out
of
which
it
grew
as
naturally
as
an
ancient
wood
seemed
to
him
like
a
being
lying
there
half
asleep
on
the
plain
and
crooning
to
itself
as
it
dozed
and
presently
as
he
sat
lazily
melting
into
its
dream
a
sound
of
horns
and
strings
and
wood
instruments
rose
to
his
ears
and
the
town
band
began
to
play
at
the
far
end
of
the
crowded
terrace
below
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
very
soft
deep-throated
drum
vezin
was
very
sensitive
to
music
knew
about
it
intelligently
and
had
even
ventured
unknown
to
his
friends
upon
the
composition
of
quiet
melodies
with
low-running
chords
which
he
played
to
himself
with
the
soft
pedal
when
no
one
was
about
and
this
music
floating
up
through
the
trees
from
an
invisible
and
doubtless
very
picturesque
band
of
the
townspeople
wholly
charmed
him
he
recognised
nothing
that
they
played
and
it
sounded
as
though
they
were
simply
improvising
without
a
conductor
no
definitely
marked
time
ran
through
the
pieces
which
ended
and
began
oddly
after
the
fashion
of
wind
through
an
aeolian
harp
it
was
part
of
the
place
and
scene
just
as
the
dying
sunlight
and
faintly
breathing
wind
were
part
of
the
scene
and
hour
and
the
mellow
notes
of
old-fashioned
plaintive
horns
pierced
here
and
there
by
the
sharper
strings
all
half
smothered
by
the
continuous
booming
of
the
deep
drum
touched
his
soul
with
a
curiously
potent
spell
that
was
almost
too
engrossing
to
be
quite
pleasant
there
was
a
certain
queer
sense
of
bewitchment
in
it
all
the
music
seemed
to
him
oddly
unartificial
it
made
him
think
of
trees
swept
by
the
wind
of
night
breezes
singing
among
wires
and
chimney-stacks
or
in
the
rigging
of
invisible
ships
or--and
the
simile
leaped
up
in
his
thoughts
with
a
sudden
sharpness
of
suggestion--a
chorus
of
animals
of
wild
creatures
somewhere
in
desolate
places
of
the
world
crying
and
singing
as
animals
will
to
the
moon
he
could
fancy
he
heard
the
wailing
half-human
cries
of
cats
upon
the
tiles
at
night
rising
and
falling
with
weird
intervals
of
sound
and
this
music
muffled
by
distance
and
the
trees
made
him
think
of
a
queer
company
of
these
creatures
on
some
roof
far
away
in
the
sky
uttering
their
solemn
music
to
one
another
and
the
moon
in
chorus
it
was
he
felt
at
the
time
a
singular
image
to
occur
to
him
yet
it
expressed
his
sensation
pictorially
better
than
anything
else
the
instruments
played
such
impossibly
odd
intervals
and
the
crescendos
and
diminuendos
were
so
very
suggestive
of
cat-land
on
the
tiles
at
night
rising
swiftly
dropping
without
warning
to
deep
notes
again
and
all
in
such
strange
confusion
of
discords
and
accords
but
at
the
same
time
a
plaintive
sweetness
resulted
on
the
whole
and
the
discords
of
these
half-broken
instruments
were
so
singular
that
they
did
not
distress
his
musical
soul
like
fiddles
out
of
tune
he
listened
a
long
time
wholly
surrendering
himself
as
his
character
was
and
then
strolled
homewards
in
the
dusk
as
the
air
grew
chilly
there
was
nothing
to
alarm
put
in
dr
silence
briefly
absolutely
nothing
said
vezin
but
you
know
it
was
all
so
fantastical
and
charming
that
my
imagination
was
profoundly
impressed
perhaps
too
he
continued
gently
explanatory
it
was
this
stirring
of
my
imagination
that
caused
other
impressions
for
as
i
walked
back
the
spell
of
the
place
began
to
steal
over
me
in
a
dozen
ways
though
all
intelligible
ways
but
there
were
other
things
i
could
not
account
for
in
the
least
even
then
incidents
you
mean
hardly
incidents
i
think
a
lot
of
vivid
sensations
crowded
themselves
upon
my
mind
and
i
could
trace
them
to
no
causes
it
was
just
after
sunset
and
the
tumbled
old
buildings
traced
magical
outlines
against
an
opalescent
sky
of
gold
and
red
the
dusk
was
running
down
the
twisted
streets
all
round
the
hill
the
plain
pressed
in
like
a
dim
sea
its
level
rising
with
the
darkness
the
spell
of
this
kind
of
scene
you
know
can
be
very
moving
and
it
was
so
that
night
yet
i
felt
that
what
came
to
me
had
nothing
directly
to
do
with
the
mystery
and
wonder
of
the
scene
not
merely
the
subtle
transformations
of
the
spirit
that
come
with
beauty
put
in
the
doctor
noticing
his
hesitation
exactly
vezin
went
on
duly
encouraged
and
no
longer
so
fearful
of
our
smiles
at
his
expense
the
impressions
came
from
somewhere
else
for
instance
down
the
busy
main
street
where
men
and
women
were
bustling
home
from
work
shopping
at
stalls
and
barrows
idly
gossiping
in
groups
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
saw
that
i
aroused
no
interest
and
that
no
one
turned
to
stare
at
me
as
a
foreigner
and
stranger
i
was
utterly
ignored
and
my
presence
among
them
excited
no
special
interest
or
attention
and
then
quite
suddenly
it
dawned
upon
me
with
conviction
that
all
the
time
this
indifference
and
inattention
were
merely
feigned
everybody
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
watching
me
closely
every
movement
i
made
was
known
and
observed
ignoring
me
was
all
a
pretence--an
elaborate
pretence
he
paused
a
moment
and
looked
at
us
to
see
if
we
were
smiling
and
then
continued
reassured--
it
is
useless
to
ask
me
how
i
noticed
this
because
i
simply
cannot
explain
it
but
the
discovery
gave
me
something
of
a
shock
before
i
got
back
to
the
inn
however
another
curious
thing
rose
up
strongly
in
my
mind
and
forced
my
recognition
of
it
as
true
and
this
too
i
may
as
well
say
at
once
was
equally
inexplicable
to
me
i
mean
i
can
only
give
you
the
fact
as
fact
it
was
to
me
the
little
man
left
his
chair
and
stood
on
the
mat
before
the
fire
his
diffidence
lessened
from
now
onwards
as
he
lost
himself
again
in
the
magic
of
the
old
adventure
his
eyes
shone
a
little
already
as
he
talked
well
he
went
on
his
soft
voice
rising
somewhat
with
his
excitement
i
was
in
a
shop
when
it
came
to
me
first--though
the
idea
must
have
been
at
work
for
a
long
time
subconsciously
to
appear
in
so
complete
a
form
all
at
once
i
was
buying
socks
i
think
he
laughed
and
struggling
with
my
dreadful
french
when
it
struck
me
that
the
woman
in
the
shop
did
not
care
two
pins
whether
i
bought
anything
or
not
she
was
indifferent
whether
she
made
a
sale
or
did
not
make
a
sale
she
was
only
pretending
to
sell
this
sounds
a
very
small
and
fanciful
incident
to
build
upon
what
follows
but
really
it
was
not
small
i
mean
it
was
the
spark
that
lit
the
line
of
powder
and
ran
along
to
the
big
blaze
in
my
mind
for
the
whole
town
i
suddenly
realised
was
something
other
than
i
so
far
saw
it
the
real
activities
and
interests
of
the
people
were
elsewhere
and
otherwise
than
appeared
their
true
lives
lay
somewhere
out
of
sight
behind
the
scenes
their
busy-ness
was
but
the
outward
semblance
that
masked
their
actual
purposes
they
bought
and
sold
and
ate
and
drank
and
walked
about
the
streets
yet
all
the
while
the
main
stream
of
their
existence
lay
somewhere
beyond
my
ken
underground
in
secret
places
in
the
shops
and
at
the
stalls
they
did
not
care
whether
i
purchased
their
articles
or
not
at
the
inn
they
were
indifferent
to
my
staying
or
going
their
life
lay
remote
from
my
own
springing
from
hidden
mysterious
sources
coursing
out
of
sight
unknown
it
was
all
a
great
elaborate
pretence
assumed
possibly
for
my
benefit
or
possibly
for
purposes
of
their
own
but
the
main
current
of
their
energies
ran
elsewhere
i
almost
felt
as
an
unwelcome
foreign
substance
might
be
expected
to
feel
when
it
has
found
its
way
into
the
human
system
and
the
whole
body
organises
itself
to
eject
it
or
to
absorb
it
the
town
was
doing
this
very
thing
to
me
this
bizarre
notion
presented
itself
forcibly
to
my
mind
as
i
walked
home
to
the
inn
and
i
began
busily
to
wonder
wherein
the
true
life
of
this
town
could
lie
and
what
were
the
actual
interests
and
activities
of
its
hidden
life
and
now
that
my
eyes
were
partly
opened
i
noticed
other
things
too
that
puzzled
me
first
of
which
i
think
was
the
extraordinary
silence
of
the
whole
place
positively
the
town
was
muffled
although
the
streets
were
paved
with
cobbles
the
people
moved
about
silently
softly
with
padded
feet
like
cats
nothing
made
noise
all
was
hushed
subdued
muted
the
very
voices
were
quiet
low-pitched
like
purring
nothing
clamorous
vehement
or
emphatic
seemed
able
to
live
in
the
drowsy
atmosphere
of
soft
dreaming
that
soothed
this
little
hill-town
into
its
sleep
it
was
like
the
woman
at
the
inn--an
outward
repose
screening
intense
inner
activity
and
purpose
yet
there
was
no
sign
of
lethargy
or
sluggishness
anywhere
about
it
the
people
were
active
and
alert
only
a
magical
and
uncanny
softness
lay
over
them
all
like
a
spell
vezin
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
for
a
moment
as
though
the
memory
had
become
very
vivid
his
voice
had
run
off
into
a
whisper
so
that
we
heard
the
last
part
with
difficulty
he
was
telling
a
true
thing
obviously
yet
something
that
he
both
liked
and
hated
telling
i
went
back
to
the
inn
he
continued
presently
in
a
louder
voice
and
dined
i
felt
a
new
strange
world
about
me
my
old
world
of
reality
receded
here
whether
i
liked
it
or
no
was
something
new
and
incomprehensible
i
regretted
having
left
the
train
so
impulsively
an
adventure
was
upon
me
and
i
loathed
adventures
as
foreign
to
my
nature
moreover
this
was
the
beginning
apparently
of
an
adventure
somewhere
deep
within
me
in
a
region
i
could
not
check
or
measure
and
a
feeling
of
alarm
mingled
itself
with
my
wonder--alarm
for
the
stability
of
what
i
had
for
forty
years
recognised
as
my
'personality'
i
went
upstairs
to
bed
my
mind
teeming
with
thoughts
that
were
unusual
to
me
and
of
rather
a
haunting
description
by
way
of
relief
i
kept
thinking
of
that
nice
prosaic
noisy
train
and
all
those
wholesome
blustering
passengers
i
almost
wished
i
were
with
them
again
but
my
dreams
took
me
elsewhere
i
dreamed
of
cats
and
soft-moving
creatures
and
the
silence
of
life
in
a
dim
muffled
world
beyond
the
senses
ii
vezin
stayed
on
from
day
to
day
indefinitely
much
longer
than
he
had
intended
he
felt
in
a
kind
of
dazed
somnolent
condition
he
did
nothing
in
particular
but
the
place
fascinated
him
and
he
could
not
decide
to
leave
decisions
were
always
very
difficult
for
him
and
he
sometimes
wondered
how
he
had
ever
brought
himself
to
the
point
of
leaving
the
train
it
seemed
as
though
some
one
else
must
have
arranged
it
for
him
and
once
or
twice
his
thoughts
ran
to
the
swarthy
frenchman
who
had
sat
opposite
if
only
he
could
have
understood
that
long
sentence
ending
so
strangely
with

cause
du
sommeil
et

cause
des
chats
he
wondered
what
it
all
meant
meanwhile
the
hushed
softness
of
the
town
held
him
prisoner
and
he
sought
in
his
muddling
gentle
way
to
find
out
where
the
mystery
lay
and
what
it
was
all
about
but
his
limited
french
and
his
constitutional
hatred
of
active
investigation
made
it
hard
for
him
to
buttonhole
anybody
and
ask
questions
he
was
content
to
observe
and
watch
and
remain
negative
the
weather
held
on
calm
and
hazy
and
this
just
suited
him
he
wandered
about
the
town
till
he
knew
every
street
and
alley
the
people
suffered
him
to
come
and
go
without
let
or
hindrance
though
it
became
clearer
to
him
every
day
that
he
was
never
free
himself
from
observation
the
town
watched
him
as
a
cat
watches
a
mouse
and
he
got
no
nearer
to
finding
out
what
they
were
all
so
busy
with
or
where
the
main
stream
of
their
activities
lay
this
remained
hidden
the
people
were
as
soft
and
mysterious
as
cats
but
that
he
was
continually
under
observation
became
more
evident
from
day
to
day
for
instance
when
he
strolled
to
the
end
of
the
town
and
entered
a
little
green
public
garden
beneath
the
ramparts
and
seated
himself
upon
one
of
the
empty
benches
in
the
sun
he
was
quite
alone--at
first
not
another
seat
was
occupied
the
little
park
was
empty
the
paths
deserted
yet
within
ten
minutes
of
his
coming
there
must
have
been
fully
twenty
persons
scattered
about
him
some
strolling
aimlessly
along
the
gravel
walks
staring
at
the
flowers
and
others
seated
on
the
wooden
benches
enjoying
the
sun
like
himself
none
of
them
appeared
to
take
any
notice
of
him
yet
he
understood
quite
well
they
had
all
come
there
to
watch
they
kept
him
under
close
observation
in
the
street
they
had
seemed
busy
enough
hurrying
upon
various
errands
yet
these
were
suddenly
all
forgotten
and
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
loll
and
laze
in
the
sun
their
duties
unremembered
five
minutes
after
he
left
the
garden
was
again
deserted
the
seats
vacant
but
in
the
crowded
street
it
was
the
same
thing
again
he
was
never
alone
he
was
ever
in
their
thoughts
by
degrees
too
he
began
to
see
how
it
was
he
was
so
cleverly
watched
yet
without
the
appearance
of
it
the
people
did
nothing
directly
they
behaved
obliquely
he
laughed
in
his
mind
as
the
thought
thus
clothed
itself
in
words
but
the
phrase
exactly
described
it
they
looked
at
him
from
angles
which
naturally
should
have
led
their
sight
in
another
direction
altogether
their
movements
were
oblique
too
so
far
as
these
concerned
himself
the
straight
direct
thing
was
not
their
way
evidently
they
did
nothing
obviously
if
he
entered
a
shop
to
buy
the
woman
walked
instantly
away
and
busied
herself
with
something
at
the
farther
end
of
the
counter
though
answering
at
once
when
he
spoke
showing
that
she
knew
he
was
there
and
that
this
was
only
her
way
of
attending
to
him
it
was
the
fashion
of
the
cat
she
followed
even
in
the
dining-room
of
the
inn
the
be-whiskered
and
courteous
waiter
lithe
and
silent
in
all
his
movements
never
seemed
able
to
come
straight
to
his
table
for
an
order
or
a
dish
he
came
by
zigzags
indirectly
vaguely
so
that
he
appeared
to
be
going
to
another
table
altogether
and
only
turned
suddenly
at
the
last
moment
and
was
there
beside
him
vezin
smiled
curiously
to
himself
as
he
described
how
he
began
to
realize
these
things
other
tourists
there
were
none
in
the
hostel
but
he
recalled
the
figures
of
one
or
two
old
men
inhabitants
who
took
their
djeuner
and
dinner
there
and
remembered
how
fantastically
they
entered
the
room
in
similar
fashion
first
they
paused
in
the
doorway
peering
about
the
room
and
then
after
a
temporary
inspection
they
came
in
as
it
were
sideways
keeping
close
to
the
walls
so
that
he
wondered
which
table
they
were
making
for
and
at
the
last
minute
making
almost
a
little
quick
run
to
their
particular
seats
and
again
he
thought
of
the
ways
and
methods
of
cats
other
small
incidents
too
impressed
him
as
all
part
of
this
queer
soft
town
with
its
muffled
indirect
life
for
the
way
some
of
the
people
appeared
and
disappeared
with
extraordinary
swiftness
puzzled
him
exceedingly
it
may
have
been
all
perfectly
natural
he
knew
yet
he
could
not
make
it
out
how
the
alleys
swallowed
them
up
and
shot
them
forth
in
a
second
of
time
when
there
were
no
visible
doorways
or
openings
near
enough
to
explain
the
phenomenon
once
he
followed
two
elderly
women
who
he
felt
had
been
particularly
examining
him
from
across
the
street--quite
near
the
inn
this
was--and
saw
them
turn
the
corner
a
few
feet
only
in
front
of
him
yet
when
he
sharply
followed
on
their
heels
he
saw
nothing
but
an
utterly
deserted
alley
stretching
in
front
of
him
with
no
sign
of
a
living
thing
and
the
only
opening
through
which
they
could
have
escaped
was
a
porch
some
fifty
yards
away
which
not
the
swiftest
human
runner
could
have
reached
in
time
and
in
just
such
sudden
fashion
people
appeared
when
he
never
expected
them
once
when
he
heard
a
great
noise
of
fighting
going
on
behind
a
low
wall
and
hurried
up
to
see
what
was
going
on
what
should
he
see
but
a
group
of
girls
and
women
engaged
in
vociferous
conversation
which
instantly
hushed
itself
to
the
normal
whispering
note
of
the
town
when
his
head
appeared
over
the
wall
and
even
then
none
of
them
turned
to
look
at
him
directly
but
slunk
off
with
the
most
unaccountable
rapidity
into
doors
and
sheds
across
the
yard
and
their
voices
he
thought
had
sounded
so
like
so
strangely
like
the
angry
snarling
of
fighting
animals
almost
of
cats
the
whole
spirit
of
the
town
however
continued
to
evade
him
as
something
elusive
protean
screened
from
the
outer
world
and
at
the
same
time
intensely
genuinely
vital
and
since
he
now
formed
part
of
its
life
this
concealment
puzzled
and
irritated
him
more--it
began
rather
to
frighten
him
out
of
the
mists
that
slowly
gathered
about
his
ordinary
surface
thoughts
there
rose
again
the
idea
that
the
inhabitants
were
waiting
for
him
to
declare
himself
to
take
an
attitude
to
do
this
or
to
do
that
and
that
when
he
had
done
so
they
in
their
turn
would
at
length
make
some
direct
response
accepting
or
rejecting
him
yet
the
vital
matter
concerning
which
his
decision
was
awaited
came
no
nearer
to
him
once
or
twice
he
purposely
followed
little
processions
or
groups
of
the
citizens
in
order
to
find
out
if
possible
on
what
purpose
they
were
bent
but
they
always
discovered
him
in
time
and
dwindled
away
each
individual
going
his
or
her
own
way
it
was
always
the
same
he
never
could
learn
what
their
main
interest
was
the
cathedral
was
ever
empty
the
old
church
of
st
martin
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
deserted
they
shopped
because
they
had
to
and
not
because
they
wished
to
the
booths
stood
neglected
the
stalls
unvisited
the
little
cafs
desolate
yet
the
streets
were
always
full
the
townsfolk
ever
on
the
bustle
can
it
be
he
thought
to
himself
yet
with
a
deprecating
laugh
that
he
should
have
dared
to
think
anything
so
odd
can
it
be
that
these
people
are
people
of
the
twilight
that
they
live
only
at
night
their
real
life
and
come
out
honestly
only
with
the
dusk
that
during
the
day
they
make
a
sham
though
brave
pretence
and
after
the
sun
is
down
their
true
life
begins
have
they
the
souls
of
night-things
and
is
the
whole
blessed
town
in
the
hands
of
the
cats
the
fancy
somehow
electrified
him
with
little
shocks
of
shrinking
and
dismay
yet
though
he
affected
to
laugh
he
knew
that
he
was
beginning
to
feel
more
than
uneasy
and
that
strange
forces
were
tugging
with
a
thousand
invisible
cords
at
the
very
centre
of
his
being
something
utterly
remote
from
his
ordinary
life
something
that
had
not
waked
for
years
began
faintly
to
stir
in
his
soul
sending
feelers
abroad
into
his
brain
and
heart
shaping
queer
thoughts
and
penetrating
even
into
certain
of
his
minor
actions
something
exceedingly
vital
to
himself
to
his
soul
hung
in
the
balance
and
always
when
he
returned
to
the
inn
about
the
hour
of
sunset
he
saw
the
figures
of
the
townsfolk
stealing
through
the
dusk
from
their
shop
doors
moving
sentry-wise
to
and
fro
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
yet
always
vanishing
silently
like
shadows
at
his
near
approach
and
as
the
inn
invariably
closed
its
doors
at
ten
o'clock
he
had
never
yet
found
the
opportunity
he
rather
half-heartedly
sought
to
see
for
himself
what
account
the
town
could
give
of
itself
at
night
--
cause
du
sommeil
et

cause
des
chats--the
words
now
rang
in
his
ears
more
and
more
often
though
still
as
yet
without
any
definite
meaning
moreover
something
made
him
sleep
like
the
dead
iii
it
was
i
think
on
the
fifth
day--though
in
this
detail
his
story
sometimes
varied--that
he
made
a
definite
discovery
which
increased
his
alarm
and
brought
him
up
to
a
rather
sharp
climax
before
that
he
had
already
noticed
that
a
change
was
going
forward
and
certain
subtle
transformations
being
brought
about
in
his
character
which
modified
several
of
his
minor
habits
and
he
had
affected
to
ignore
them
here
however
was
something
he
could
no
longer
ignore
and
it
startled
him
at
the
best
of
times
he
was
never
very
positive
always
negative
rather
compliant
and
acquiescent
yet
when
necessity
arose
he
was
capable
of
reasonably
vigorous
action
and
could
take
a
strongish
decision
the
discovery
he
now
made
that
brought
him
up
with
such
a
sharp
turn
was
that
this
power
had
positively
dwindled
to
nothing
he
found
it
impossible
to
make
up
his
mind
for
on
this
fifth
day
he
realised
that
he
had
stayed
long
enough
in
the
town
and
that
for
reasons
he
could
only
vaguely
define
to
himself
it
was
wiser
and
safer
that
he
should
leave
and
he
found
that
he
could
not
leave
this
is
difficult
to
describe
in
words
and
it
was
more
by
gesture
and
the
expression
of
his
face
that
he
conveyed
to
dr
silence
the
state
of
impotence
he
had
reached
all
this
spying
and
watching
he
said
had
as
it
were
spun
a
net
about
his
feet
so
that
he
was
trapped
and
powerless
to
escape
he
felt
like
a
fly
that
had
blundered
into
the
intricacies
of
a
great
web
he
was
caught
imprisoned
and
could
not
get
away
it
was
a
distressing
sensation
a
numbness
had
crept
over
his
will
till
it
had
become
almost
incapable
of
decision
the
mere
thought
of
vigorous
action--action
towards
escape--began
to
terrify
him
all
the
currents
of
his
life
had
turned
inwards
upon
himself
striving
to
bring
to
the
surface
something
that
lay
buried
almost
beyond
reach
determined
to
force
his
recognition
of
something
he
had
long
forgotten--forgotten
years
upon
years
centuries
almost
ago
it
seemed
as
though
a
window
deep
within
his
being
would
presently
open
and
reveal
an
entirely
new
world
yet
somehow
a
world
that
was
not
unfamiliar
beyond
that
again
he
fancied
a
great
curtain
hung
and
when
that
too
rolled
up
he
would
see
still
farther
into
this
region
and
at
last
understand
something
of
the
secret
life
of
these
extraordinary
people
is
this
why
they
wait
and
watch
he
asked
himself
with
rather
a
shaking
heart
for
the
time
when
i
shall
join
them--or
refuse
to
join
them
does
the
decision
rest
with
me
after
all
and
not
with
them
and
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
sinister
character
of
the
adventure
first
really
declared
itself
and
he
became
genuinely
alarmed
the
stability
of
his
rather
fluid
little
personality
was
at
stake
he
felt
and
something
in
his
heart
turned
coward
why
otherwise
should
he
have
suddenly
taken
to
walking
stealthily
silently
making
as
little
sound
as
possible
for
ever
looking
behind
him
why
else
should
he
have
moved
almost
on
tiptoe
about
the
passages
of
the
practically
deserted
inn
and
when
he
was
abroad
have
found
himself
deliberately
taking
advantage
of
what
cover
presented
itself
and
why
if
he
was
not
afraid
should
the
wisdom
of
staying
indoors
after
sundown
have
suddenly
occurred
to
him
as
eminently
desirable
why
indeed
and
when
john
silence
gently
pressed
him
for
an
explanation
of
these
things
he
admitted
apologetically
that
he
had
none
to
give
it
was
simply
that
i
feared
something
might
happen
to
me
unless
i
kept
a
sharp
look-out
i
felt
afraid
it
was
instinctive
was
all
he
could
say
i
got
the
impression
that
the
whole
town
was
after
me--wanted
me
for
something
and
that
if
it
got
me
i
should
lose
myself
or
at
least
the
self
i
knew
in
some
unfamiliar
state
of
consciousness
but
i
am
not
a
psychologist
you
know
he
added
meekly
and
i
cannot
define
it
better
than
that
it
was
while
lounging
in
the
courtyard
half
an
hour
before
the
evening
meal
that
vezin
made
this
discovery
and
he
at
once
went
upstairs
to
his
quiet
room
at
the
end
of
the
winding
passage
to
think
it
over
alone
in
the
yard
it
was
empty
enough
true
but
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
the
big
woman
whom
he
dreaded
would
come
out
of
some
door
with
her
pretence
of
knitting
to
sit
and
watch
him
this
had
happened
several
times
and
he
could
not
endure
the
sight
of
her
he
still
remembered
his
original
fancy
bizarre
though
it
was
that
she
would
spring
upon
him
the
moment
his
back
was
turned
and
land
with
one
single
crushing
leap
upon
his
neck
of
course
it
was
nonsense
but
then
it
haunted
him
and
once
an
idea
begins
to
do
that
it
ceases
to
be
nonsense
it
has
clothed
itself
in
reality
he
went
upstairs
accordingly
it
was
dusk
and
the
oil
lamps
had
not
yet
been
lit
in
the
passages
he
stumbled
over
the
uneven
surface
of
the
ancient
flooring
passing
the
dim
outlines
of
doors
along
the
corridor--doors
that
he
had
never
once
seen
opened--rooms
that
seemed
never
occupied
he
moved
as
his
habit
now
was
stealthily
and
on
tiptoe
half-way
down
the
last
passage
to
his
own
chamber
there
was
a
sharp
turn
and
it
was
just
here
while
groping
round
the
walls
with
outstretched
hands
that
his
fingers
touched
something
that
was
not
wall--something
that
moved
it
was
soft
and
warm
in
texture
indescribably
fragrant
and
about
the
height
of
his
shoulder
and
he
immediately
thought
of
a
furry
sweet-smelling
kitten
the
next
minute
he
knew
it
was
something
quite
different
instead
of
investigating
however--his
nerves
must
have
been
too
overwrought
for
that
he
said--he
shrank
back
as
closely
as
possible
against
the
wall
on
the
other
side
the
thing
whatever
it
was
slipped
past
him
with
a
sound
of
rustling
and
retreating
with
light
footsteps
down
the
passage
behind
him
was
gone
a
breath
of
warm
scented
air
was
wafted
to
his
nostrils
vezin
caught
his
breath
for
an
instant
and
paused
stockstill
half
leaning
against
the
wall--and
then
almost
ran
down
the
remaining
distance
and
entered
his
room
with
a
rush
locking
the
door
hurriedly
behind
him
yet
it
was
not
fear
that
made
him
run
it
was
excitement
pleasurable
excitement
his
nerves
were
tingling
and
a
delicious
glow
made
itself
felt
all
over
his
body
in
a
flash
it
came
to
him
that
this
was
just
what
he
had
felt
twenty-five
years
ago
as
a
boy
when
he
was
in
love
for
the
first
time
warm
currents
of
life
ran
all
over
him
and
mounted
to
his
brain
in
a
whirl
of
soft
delight
his
mood
was
suddenly
become
tender
melting
loving
the
room
was
quite
dark
and
he
collapsed
upon
the
sofa
by
the
window
wondering
what
had
happened
to
him
and
what
it
all
meant
but
the
only
thing
he
understood
clearly
in
that
instant
was
that
something
in
him
had
swiftly
magically
changed
he
no
longer
wished
to
leave
or
to
argue
with
himself
about
leaving
the
encounter
in
the
passage-way
had
changed
all
that
the
strange
perfume
of
it
still
hung
about
him
bemusing
his
heart
and
mind
for
he
knew
that
it
was
a
girl
who
had
passed
him
a
girl's
face
that
his
fingers
had
brushed
in
the
darkness
and
he
felt
in
some
extraordinary
way
as
though
he
had
been
actually
kissed
by
her
kissed
full
upon
the
lips
trembling
he
sat
upon
the
sofa
by
the
window
and
struggled
to
collect
his
thoughts
he
was
utterly
unable
to
understand
how
the
mere
passing
of
a
girl
in
the
darkness
of
a
narrow
passage-way
could
communicate
so
electric
a
thrill
to
his
whole
being
that
he
still
shook
with
the
sweetness
of
it
yet
there
it
was
and
he
found
it
as
useless
to
deny
as
to
attempt
analysis
some
ancient
fire
had
entered
his
veins
and
now
ran
coursing
through
his
blood
and
that
he
was
forty-five
instead
of
twenty
did
not
matter
one
little
jot
out
of
all
the
inner
turmoil
and
confusion
emerged
the
one
salient
fact
that
the
mere
atmosphere
the
merest
casual
touch
of
this
girl
unseen
unknown
in
the
darkness
had
been
sufficient
to
stir
dormant
fires
in
the
centre
of
his
heart
and
rouse
his
whole
being
from
a
state
of
feeble
sluggishness
to
one
of
tearing
and
tumultuous
excitement
after
a
time
however
the
number
of
vezin's
years
began
to
assert
their
cumulative
power
he
grew
calmer
and
when
a
knock
came
at
length
upon
his
door
and
he
heard
the
waiter's
voice
suggesting
that
dinner
was
nearly
over
he
pulled
himself
together
and
slowly
made
his
way
downstairs
into
the
dining-room
every
one
looked
up
as
he
entered
for
he
was
very
late
but
he
took
his
customary
seat
in
the
far
corner
and
began
to
eat
the
trepidation
was
still
in
his
nerves
but
the
fact
that
he
had
passed
through
the
courtyard
and
hall
without
catching
sight
of
a
petticoat
served
to
calm
him
a
little
he
ate
so
fast
that
he
had
almost
caught
up
with
the
current
stage
of
the
table
d'hte
when
a
slight
commotion
in
the
room
drew
his
attention
his
chair
was
so
placed
that
the
door
and
the
greater
portion
of
the
long
salle

manger
were
behind
him
yet
it
was
not
necessary
to
turn
round
to
know
that
the
same
person
he
had
passed
in
the
dark
passage
had
now
come
into
the
room
he
felt
the
presence
long
before
he
heard
or
saw
any
one
then
he
became
aware
that
the
old
men
the
only
other
guests
were
rising
one
by
one
in
their
places
and
exchanging
greetings
with
some
one
who
passed
among
them
from
table
to
table
and
when
at
length
he
turned
with
his
heart
beating
furiously
to
ascertain
for
himself
he
saw
the
form
of
a
young
girl
lithe
and
slim
moving
down
the
centre
of
the
room
and
making
straight
for
his
own
table
in
the
corner
she
moved
wonderfully
with
sinuous
grace
like
a
young
panther
and
her
approach
filled
him
with
such
delicious
bewilderment
that
he
was
utterly
unable
to
tell
at
first
what
her
face
was
like
or
discover
what
it
was
about
the
whole
presentment
of
the
creature
that
filled
him
anew
with
trepidation
and
delight
ah
ma'mselle
est
de
retour
he
heard
the
old
waiter
murmur
at
his
side
and
he
was
just
able
to
take
in
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
proprietress
when
she
was
upon
him
and
he
heard
her
voice
she
was
addressing
him
something
of
red
lips
he
saw
and
laughing
white
teeth
and
stray
wisps
of
fine
dark
hair
about
the
temples
but
all
the
rest
was
a
dream
in
which
his
own
emotion
rose
like
a
thick
cloud
before
his
eyes
and
prevented
his
seeing
accurately
or
knowing
exactly
what
he
did
he
was
aware
that
she
greeted
him
with
a
charming
little
bow
that
her
beautiful
large
eyes
looked
searchingly
into
his
own
that
the
perfume
he
had
noticed
in
the
dark
passage
again
assailed
his
nostrils
and
that
she
was
bending
a
little
towards
him
and
leaning
with
one
hand
on
the
table
at
this
side
she
was
quite
close
to
him--that
was
the
chief
thing
he
knew--explaining
that
she
had
been
asking
after
the
comfort
of
her
mother's
guests
and
now
was
introducing
herself
to
the
latest
arrival--himself
m'sieur
has
already
been
here
a
few
days
he
heard
the
waiter
say
and
then
her
own
voice
sweet
as
singing
replied--
ah
but
m'sieur
is
not
going
to
leave
us
just
yet
i
hope
my
mother
is
too
old
to
look
after
the
comfort
of
our
guests
properly
but
now
i
am
here
i
will
remedy
all
that
she
laughed
deliciously
m'sieur
shall
be
well
looked
after
vezin
struggling
with
his
emotion
and
desire
to
be
polite
half
rose
to
acknowledge
the
pretty
speech
and
to
stammer
some
sort
of
reply
but
as
he
did
so
his
hand
by
chance
touched
her
own
that
was
resting
upon
the
table
and
a
shock
that
was
for
all
the
world
like
a
shock
of
electricity
passed
from
her
skin
into
his
body
his
soul
wavered
and
shook
deep
within
him
he
caught
her
eyes
fixed
upon
his
own
with
a
look
of
most
curious
intentness
and
the
next
moment
he
knew
that
he
had
sat
down
wordless
again
on
his
chair
that
the
girl
was
already
half-way
across
the
room
and
that
he
was
trying
to
eat
his
salad
with
a
dessert-spoon
and
a
knife
longing
for
her
return
and
yet
dreading
it
he
gulped
down
the
remainder
of
his
dinner
and
then
went
at
once
to
his
bedroom
to
be
alone
with
his
thoughts
this
time
the
passages
were
lighted
and
he
suffered
no
exciting
contretemps
yet
the
winding
corridor
was
dim
with
shadows
and
the
last
portion
from
the
bend
of
the
walls
onwards
seemed
longer
than
he
had
ever
known
it
it
ran
downhill
like
the
pathway
on
a
mountain
side
and
as
he
tiptoed
softly
down
it
he
felt
that
by
rights
it
ought
to
have
led
him
clean
out
of
the
house
into
the
heart
of
a
great
forest
the
world
was
singing
with
him
strange
fancies
filled
his
brain
and
once
in
the
room
with
the
door
securely
locked
he
did
not
light
the
candles
but
sat
by
the
open
window
thinking
long
long
thoughts
that
came
unbidden
in
troops
to
his
mind
iv
this
part
of
the
story
he
told
to
dr
silence
without
special
coaxing
it
is
true
yet
with
much
stammering
embarrassment
he
could
not
in
the
least
understand
he
said
how
the
girl
had
managed
to
affect
him
so
profoundly
and
even
before
he
had
set
eyes
upon
her
for
her
mere
proximity
in
the
darkness
had
been
sufficient
to
set
him
on
fire
he
knew
nothing
of
enchantments
and
for
years
had
been
a
stranger
to
anything
approaching
tender
relations
with
any
member
of
the
opposite
sex
for
he
was
encased
in
shyness
and
realised
his
overwhelming
defects
only
too
well
yet
this
bewitching
young
creature
came
to
him
deliberately
her
manner
was
unmistakable
and
she
sought
him
out
on
every
possible
occasion
chaste
and
sweet
she
was
undoubtedly
yet
frankly
inviting
and
she
won
him
utterly
with
the
first
glance
of
her
shining
eyes
even
if
she
had
not
already
done
so
in
the
dark
merely
by
the
magic
of
her
invisible
presence
you
felt
she
was
altogether
wholesome
and
good
queried
the
doctor
you
had
no
reaction
of
any
sort--for
instance
of
alarm
vezin
looked
up
sharply
with
one
of
his
inimitable
little
apologetic
smiles
it
was
some
time
before
he
replied
the
mere
memory
of
the
adventure
had
suffused
his
shy
face
with
blushes
and
his
brown
eyes
sought
the
floor
again
before
he
answered
i
don't
think
i
can
quite
say
that
he
explained
presently
i
acknowledged
certain
qualms
sitting
up
in
my
room
afterwards
a
conviction
grew
upon
me
that
there
was
something
about
her--how
shall
i
express
it--well
something
unholy
it
is
not
impurity
in
any
sense
physical
or
mental
that
i
mean
but
something
quite
indefinable
that
gave
me
a
vague
sensation
of
the
creeps
she
drew
me
and
at
the
same
time
repelled
me
more
than--than--
he
hesitated
blushing
furiously
and
unable
to
finish
the
sentence
nothing
like
it
has
ever
come
to
me
before
or
since
he
concluded
with
lame
confusion
i
suppose
it
was
as
you
suggested
just
now
something
of
an
enchantment
at
any
rate
it
was
strong
enough
to
make
me
feel
that
i
would
stay
in
that
awful
little
haunted
town
for
years
if
only
i
could
see
her
every
day
hear
her
voice
watch
her
wonderful
movements
and
sometimes
perhaps
touch
her
hand
can
you
explain
to
me
what
you
felt
was
the
source
of
her
power
john
silence
asked
looking
purposely
anywhere
but
at
the
narrator
i
am
surprised
that
you
should
ask
me
such
a
question
answered
vezin
with
the
nearest
approach
to
dignity
he
could
manage
i
think
no
man
can
describe
to
another
convincingly
wherein
lies
the
magic
of
the
woman
who
ensnares
him
i
certainly
cannot
i
can
only
say
this
slip
of
a
girl
bewitched
me
and
the
mere
knowledge
that
she
was
living
and
sleeping
in
the
same
house
filled
me
with
an
extraordinary
sense
of
delight
but
there's
one
thing
i
can
tell
you
he
went
on
earnestly
his
eyes
aglow
namely
that
she
seemed
to
sum
up
and
synthesise
in
herself
all
the
strange
hidden
forces
that
operated
so
mysteriously
in
the
town
and
its
inhabitants
she
had
the
silken
movements
of
the
panther
going
smoothly
silently
to
and
fro
and
the
same
indirect
oblique
methods
as
the
townsfolk
screening
like
them
secret
purposes
of
her
own--purposes
that
i
was
sure
had
me
for
their
objective
she
kept
me
to
my
terror
and
delight
ceaselessly
under
observation
yet
so
carelessly
so
consummately
that
another
man
less
sensitive
if
i
may
say
so--he
made
a
deprecating
gesture--or
less
prepared
by
what
had
gone
before
would
never
have
noticed
it
at
all
she
was
always
still
always
reposeful
yet
she
seemed
to
be
everywhere
at
once
so
that
i
never
could
escape
from
her
i
was
continually
meeting
the
stare
and
laughter
of
her
great
eyes
in
the
corners
of
the
rooms
in
the
passages
calmly
looking
at
me
through
the
windows
or
in
the
busiest
parts
of
the
public
streets
their
intimacy
it
seems
grew
very
rapidly
after
this
first
encounter
which
had
so
violently
disturbed
the
little
man's
equilibrium
he
was
naturally
very
prim
and
prim
folk
live
mostly
in
so
small
a
world
that
anything
violently
unusual
may
shake
them
clean
out
of
it
and
they
therefore
instinctively
distrust
originality
but
vezin
began
to
forget
his
primness
after
awhile
the
girl
was
always
modestly
behaved
and
as
her
mother's
representative
she
naturally
had
to
do
with
the
guests
in
the
hotel
it
was
not
out
of
the
way
that
a
spirit
of
camaraderie
should
spring
up
besides
she
was
young
she
was
charmingly
pretty
she
was
french
and--she
obviously
liked
him
at
the
same
time
there
was
something
indescribable--a
certain
indefinable
atmosphere
of
other
places
other
times--that
made
him
try
hard
to
remain
on
his
guard
and
sometimes
made
him
catch
his
breath
with
a
sudden
start
it
was
all
rather
like
a
delirious
dream
half
delight
half
dread
he
confided
in
a
whisper
to
dr
silence
and
more
than
once
he
hardly
knew
quite
what
he
was
doing
or
saying
as
though
he
were
driven
forward
by
impulses
he
scarcely
recognised
as
his
own
and
though
the
thought
of
leaving
presented
itself
again
and
again
to
his
mind
it
was
each
time
with
less
insistence
so
that
he
stayed
on
from
day
to
day
becoming
more
and
more
a
part
of
the
sleepy
life
of
this
dreamy
mediaeval
town
losing
more
and
more
of
his
recognisable
personality
soon
he
felt
the
curtain
within
would
roll
up
with
an
awful
rush
and
he
would
find
himself
suddenly
admitted
into
the
secret
purposes
of
the
hidden
life
that
lay
behind
it
all
only
by
that
time
he
would
have
become
transformed
into
an
entirely
different
being
and
meanwhile
he
noticed
various
little
signs
of
the
intention
to
make
his
stay
attractive
to
him
flowers
in
his
bedroom
a
more
comfortable
arm-chair
in
the
corner
and
even
special
little
extra
dishes
on
his
private
table
in
the
dining-room
conversations
too
with
mademoiselle
ils
became
more
and
more
frequent
and
pleasant
and
although
they
seldom
travelled
beyond
the
weather
or
the
details
of
the
town
the
girl
he
noticed
was
never
in
a
hurry
to
bring
them
to
an
end
and
often
contrived
to
interject
little
odd
sentences
that
he
never
properly
understood
yet
felt
to
be
significant
and
it
was
these
stray
remarks
full
of
a
meaning
that
evaded
him
that
pointed
to
some
hidden
purpose
of
her
own
and
made
him
feel
uneasy
they
all
had
to
do
he
felt
sure
with
reasons
for
his
staying
on
in
the
town
indefinitely
and
has
m'sieur
not
even
yet
come
to
a
decision
she
said
softly
in
his
ear
sitting
beside
him
in
the
sunny
yard
before
djeuner
the
acquaintance
having
progressed
with
significant
rapidity
because
if
it's
so
difficult
we
must
all
try
together
to
help
him
the
question
startled
him
following
upon
his
own
thoughts
it
was
spoken
with
a
pretty
laugh
and
a
stray
bit
of
hair
across
one
eye
as
she
turned
and
peered
at
him
half
roguishly
possibly
he
did
not
quite
understand
the
french
of
it
for
her
near
presence
always
confused
his
small
knowledge
of
the
language
distressingly
yet
the
words
and
her
manner
and
something
else
that
lay
behind
it
all
in
her
mind
frightened
him
it
gave
such
point
to
his
feeling
that
the
town
was
waiting
for
him
to
make
his
mind
up
on
some
important
matter
at
the
same
time
her
voice
and
the
fact
that
she
was
there
so
close
beside
him
in
her
soft
dark
dress
thrilled
him
inexpressibly
it
is
true
i
find
it
difficult
to
leave
he
stammered
losing
his
way
deliciously
in
the
depths
of
her
eyes
and
especially
now
that
mademoiselle
ils
has
come
he
was
surprised
at
the
success
of
his
sentence
and
quite
delighted
with
the
little
gallantry
of
it
but
at
the
same
time
he
could
have
bitten
his
tongue
off
for
having
said
it
then
after
all
you
like
our
little
town
or
you
would
not
be
pleased
to
stay
on
she
said
ignoring
the
compliment
i
am
enchanted
with
it
and
enchanted
with
you
he
cried
feeling
that
his
tongue
was
somehow
slipping
beyond
the
control
of
his
brain
and
he
was
on
the
verge
of
saying
all
manner
of
other
things
of
the
wildest
description
when
the
girl
sprang
lightly
up
from
her
chair
beside
him
and
made
to
go
it
is
soupe

l'onion
to-day
she
cried
laughing
back
at
him
through
the
sunlight
and
i
must
go
and
see
about
it
otherwise
you
know
m'sieur
will
not
enjoy
his
dinner
and
then
perhaps
he
will
leave
us
he
watched
her
cross
the
courtyard
moving
with
all
the
grace
and
lightness
of
the
feline
race
and
her
simple
black
dress
clothed
her
he
thought
exactly
like
the
fur
of
the
same
supple
species
she
turned
once
to
laugh
at
him
from
the
porch
with
the
glass
door
and
then
stopped
a
moment
to
speak
to
her
mother
who
sat
knitting
as
usual
in
her
corner
seat
just
inside
the
hall-way
but
how
was
it
then
that
the
moment
his
eye
fell
upon
this
ungainly
woman
the
pair
of
them
appeared
suddenly
as
other
than
they
were
whence
came
that
transforming
dignity
and
sense
of
power
that
enveloped
them
both
as
by
magic
what
was
it
about
that
massive
woman
that
made
her
appear
instantly
regal
and
set
her
on
a
throne
in
some
dark
and
dreadful
scenery
wielding
a
sceptre
over
the
red
glare
of
some
tempestuous
orgy
and
why
did
this
slender
stripling
of
a
girl
graceful
as
a
willow
lithe
as
a
young
leopard
assume
suddenly
an
air
of
sinister
majesty
and
move
with
flame
and
smoke
about
her
head
and
the
darkness
of
night
beneath
her
feet
vezin
caught
his
breath
and
sat
there
transfixed
then
almost
simultaneously
with
its
appearance
the
queer
notion
vanished
again
and
the
sunlight
of
day
caught
them
both
and
he
heard
her
laughing
to
her
mother
about
the
soupe

l'onion
and
saw
her
glancing
back
at
him
over
her
dear
little
shoulder
with
a
smile
that
made
him
think
of
a
dew-kissed
rose
bending
lightly
before
summer
airs
and
indeed
the
onion
soup
was
particularly
excellent
that
day
because
he
saw
another
cover
laid
at
his
small
table
and
with
fluttering
heart
heard
the
waiter
murmur
by
way
of
explanation
that
ma'mselle
ils
would
honour
m'sieur
to-day
at
djeuner
as
her
custom
sometimes
is
with
her
mother's
guests
so
actually
she
sat
by
him
all
through
that
delirious
meal
talking
quietly
to
him
in
easy
french
seeing
that
he
was
well
looked
after
mixing
the
salad-dressing
and
even
helping
him
with
her
own
hand
and
later
in
the
afternoon
while
he
was
smoking
in
the
courtyard
longing
for
a
sight
of
her
as
soon
as
her
duties
were
done
she
came
again
to
his
side
and
when
he
rose
to
meet
her
she
stood
facing
him
a
moment
full
of
a
perplexing
sweet
shyness
before
she
spoke--
my
mother
thinks
you
ought
to
know
more
of
the
beauties
of
our
little
town
and
i
think
so
too
would
m'sieur
like
me
to
be
his
guide
perhaps
i
can
show
him
everything
for
our
family
has
lived
here
for
many
generations
she
had
him
by
the
hand
indeed
before
he
could
find
a
single
word
to
express
his
pleasure
and
led
him
all
unresisting
out
into
the
street
yet
in
such
a
way
that
it
seemed
perfectly
natural
she
should
do
so
and
without
the
faintest
suggestion
of
boldness
or
immodesty
her
face
glowed
with
the
pleasure
and
interest
of
it
and
with
her
short
dress
and
tumbled
hair
she
looked
every
bit
the
charming
child
of
seventeen
that
she
was
innocent
and
playful
proud
of
her
native
town
and
alive
beyond
her
years
to
the
sense
of
its
ancient
beauty
so
they
went
over
the
town
together
and
she
showed
him
what
she
considered
its
chief
interest
the
tumble-down
old
house
where
her
forebears
had
lived
the
sombre
aristocratic-looking
mansion
where
her
mother's
family
dwelt
for
centuries
and
the
ancient
market-place
where
several
hundred
years
before
the
witches
had
been
burnt
by
the
score
she
kept
up
a
lively
running
stream
of
talk
about
it
all
of
which
he
understood
not
a
fiftieth
part
as
he
trudged
along
by
her
side
cursing
his
forty-five
years
and
feeling
all
the
yearnings
of
his
early
manhood
revive
and
jeer
at
him
and
as
she
talked
england
and
surbiton
seemed
very
far
away
indeed
almost
in
another
age
of
the
world's
history
her
voice
touched
something
immeasurably
old
in
him
something
that
slept
deep
it
lulled
the
surface
parts
of
his
consciousness
to
sleep
allowing
what
was
far
more
ancient
to
awaken
like
the
town
with
its
elaborate
pretence
of
modern
active
life
the
upper
layers
of
his
being
became
dulled
soothed
muffled
and
what
lay
underneath
began
to
stir
in
its
sleep
that
big
curtain
swayed
a
little
to
and
fro
presently
it
might
lift
altogether
he
began
to
understand
a
little
better
at
last
the
mood
of
the
town
was
reproducing
itself
in
him
in
proportion
as
his
ordinary
external
self
became
muffled
that
inner
secret
life
that
was
far
more
real
and
vital
asserted
itself
and
this
girl
was
surely
the
high-priestess
of
it
all
the
chief
instrument
of
its
accomplishment
new
thoughts
with
new
interpretations
flooded
his
mind
as
she
walked
beside
him
through
the
winding
streets
while
the
picturesque
old
gabled
town
softly
coloured
in
the
sunset
had
never
appeared
to
him
so
wholly
wonderful
and
seductive
and
only
one
curious
incident
came
to
disturb
and
puzzle
him
slight
in
itself
but
utterly
inexplicable
bringing
white
terror
into
the
child's
face
and
a
scream
to
her
laughing
lips
he
had
merely
pointed
to
a
column
of
blue
smoke
that
rose
from
the
burning
autumn
leaves
and
made
a
picture
against
the
red
roofs
and
had
then
run
to
the
wall
and
called
her
to
his
side
to
watch
the
flames
shooting
here
and
there
through
the
heap
of
rubbish
yet
at
the
sight
of
it
as
though
taken
by
surprise
her
face
had
altered
dreadfully
and
she
had
turned
and
run
like
the
wind
calling
out
wild
sentences
to
him
as
she
ran
of
which
he
had
not
understood
a
single
word
except
that
the
fire
apparently
frightened
her
and
she
wanted
to
get
quickly
away
from
it
and
to
get
him
away
too
yet
five
minutes
later
she
was
as
calm
and
happy
again
as
though
nothing
had
happened
to
alarm
or
waken
troubled
thoughts
in
her
and
they
had
both
forgotten
the
incident
they
were
leaning
over
the
ruined
ramparts
together
listening
to
the
weird
music
of
the
band
as
he
had
heard
it
the
first
day
of
his
arrival
it
moved
him
again
profoundly
as
it
had
done
before
and
somehow
he
managed
to
find
his
tongue
and
his
best
french
the
girl
leaned
across
the
stones
close
beside
him
no
one
was
about
driven
by
some
remorseless
engine
within
he
began
to
stammer
something--he
hardly
knew
what--of
his
strange
admiration
for
her
almost
at
the
first
word
she
sprang
lightly
off
the
wall
and
came
up
smiling
in
front
of
him
just
touching
his
knees
as
he
sat
there
she
was
hatless
as
usual
and
the
sun
caught
her
hair
and
one
side
of
her
cheek
and
throat
oh
i'm
so
glad
she
cried
clapping
her
little
hands
softly
in
his
face
so
very
glad
because
that
means
that
if
you
like
me
you
must
also
like
what
i
do
and
what
i
belong
to
already
he
regretted
bitterly
having
lost
control
of
himself
something
in
the
phrasing
of
her
sentence
chilled
him
he
knew
the
fear
of
embarking
upon
an
unknown
and
dangerous
sea
you
will
take
part
in
our
real
life
i
mean
she
added
softly
with
an
indescribable
coaxing
of
manner
as
though
she
noticed
his
shrinking
you
will
come
back
to
us
already
this
slip
of
a
child
seemed
to
dominate
him
he
felt
her
power
coming
over
him
more
and
more
something
emanated
from
her
that
stole
over
his
senses
and
made
him
aware
that
her
personality
for
all
its
simple
grace
held
forces
that
were
stately
imposing
august
he
saw
her
again
moving
through
smoke
and
flame
amid
broken
and
tempestuous
scenery
alarmingly
strong
her
terrible
mother
by
her
side
dimly
this
shone
through
her
smile
and
appearance
of
charming
innocence
you
will
i
know
she
repeated
holding
him
with
her
eyes
they
were
quite
alone
up
there
on
the
ramparts
and
the
sensation
that
she
was
overmastering
him
stirred
a
wild
sensuousness
in
his
blood
the
mingled
abandon
and
reserve
in
her
attracted
him
furiously
and
all
of
him
that
was
man
rose
up
and
resisted
the
creeping
influence
at
the
same
time
acclaiming
it
with
the
full
delight
of
his
forgotten
youth
an
irresistible
desire
came
to
him
to
question
her
to
summon
what
still
remained
to
him
of
his
own
little
personality
in
an
effort
to
retain
the
right
to
his
normal
self
the
girl
had
grown
quiet
again
and
was
now
leaning
on
the
broad
wall
close
beside
him
gazing
out
across
the
darkening
plain
her
elbows
on
the
coping
motionless
as
a
figure
carved
in
stone
he
took
his
courage
in
both
hands
tell
me
ils
he
said
unconsciously
imitating
her
own
purring
softness
of
voice
yet
aware
that
he
was
utterly
in
earnest
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
town
and
what
is
this
real
life
you
speak
of
and
why
is
it
that
the
people
watch
me
from
morning
to
night
tell
me
what
it
all
means
and
tell
me
he
added
more
quickly
with
passion
in
his
voice
what
you
really
are--yourself
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
at
him
through
half-closed
eyelids
her
growing
inner
excitement
betraying
itself
by
the
faint
colour
that
ran
like
a
shadow
across
her
face
it
seems
to
me--he
faltered
oddly
under
her
gaze--that
i
have
some
right
to
know--
suddenly
she
opened
her
eyes
to
the
full
you
love
me
then
she
asked
softly
i
swear
he
cried
impetuously
moved
as
by
the
force
of
a
rising
tide
i
never
felt
before--i
have
never
known
any
other
girl
who--
then
you
have
the
right
to
know
she
calmly
interrupted
his
confused
confession
for
love
shares
all
secrets
she
paused
and
a
thrill
like
fire
ran
swiftly
through
him
her
words
lifted
him
off
the
earth
and
he
felt
a
radiant
happiness
followed
almost
the
same
instant
in
horrible
contrast
by
the
thought
of
death
he
became
aware
that
she
had
turned
her
eyes
upon
his
own
and
was
speaking
again
the
real
life
i
speak
of
she
whispered
is
the
old
old
life
within
the
life
of
long
ago
the
life
to
which
you
too
once
belonged
and
to
which
you
still
belong
a
faint
wave
of
memory
troubled
the
deeps
of
his
soul
as
her
low
voice
sank
into
him
what
she
was
saying
he
knew
instinctively
to
be
true
even
though
he
could
not
as
yet
understand
its
full
purport
his
present
life
seemed
slipping
from
him
as
he
listened
merging
his
personality
in
one
that
was
far
older
and
greater
it
was
this
loss
of
his
present
self
that
brought
to
him
the
thought
of
death
you
came
here
she
went
on
with
the
purpose
of
seeking
it
and
the
people
felt
your
presence
and
are
waiting
to
know
what
you
decide
whether
you
will
leave
them
without
having
found
it
or
whether--
her
eyes
remained
fixed
upon
his
own
but
her
face
began
to
change
growing
larger
and
darker
with
an
expression
of
age
it
is
their
thoughts
constantly
playing
about
your
soul
that
makes
you
feel
they
watch
you
they
do
not
watch
you
with
their
eyes
the
purposes
of
their
inner
life
are
calling
to
you
seeking
to
claim
you
you
were
all
part
of
the
same
life
long
long
ago
and
now
they
want
you
back
again
among
them
vezin's
timid
heart
sank
with
dread
as
he
listened
but
the
girl's
eyes
held
him
with
a
net
of
joy
so
that
he
had
no
wish
to
escape
she
fascinated
him
as
it
were
clean
out
of
his
normal
self
alone
however
the
people
could
never
have
caught
and
held
you
she
resumed
the
motive
force
was
not
strong
enough
it
has
faded
through
all
these
years
but
i--she
paused
a
moment
and
looked
at
him
with
complete
confidence
in
her
splendid
eyes--i
possess
the
spell
to
conquer
you
and
hold
you
the
spell
of
old
love
i
can
win
you
back
again
and
make
you
live
the
old
life
with
me
for
the
force
of
the
ancient
tie
between
us
if
i
choose
to
use
it
is
irresistible
and
i
do
choose
to
use
it
i
still
want
you
and
you
dear
soul
of
my
dim
past--she
pressed
closer
to
him
so
that
her
breath
passed
across
his
eyes
and
her
voice
positively
sang--i
mean
to
have
you
for
you
love
me
and
are
utterly
at
my
mercy
vezin
heard
and
yet
did
not
hear
understood
yet
did
not
understand
he
had
passed
into
a
condition
of
exaltation
the
world
was
beneath
his
feet
made
of
music
and
flowers
and
he
was
flying
somewhere
far
above
it
through
the
sunshine
of
pure
delight
he
was
breathless
and
giddy
with
the
wonder
of
her
words
they
intoxicated
him
and
still
the
terror
of
it
all
the
dreadful
thought
of
death
pressed
ever
behind
her
sentences
for
flames
shot
through
her
voice
out
of
black
smoke
and
licked
at
his
soul
and
they
communicated
with
one
another
it
seemed
to
him
by
a
process
of
swift
telepathy
for
his
french
could
never
have
compassed
all
he
said
to
her
yet
she
understood
perfectly
and
what
she
said
to
him
was
like
the
recital
of
verses
long
since
known
and
the
mingled
pain
and
sweetness
of
it
as
he
listened
were
almost
more
than
his
little
soul
could
hold
yet
i
came
here
wholly
by
chance--
he
heard
himself
saying
no
she
cried
with
passion
you
came
here
because
i
called
to
you
i
have
called
to
you
for
years
and
you
came
with
the
whole
force
of
the
past
behind
you
you
had
to
come
for
i
own
you
and
i
claim
you
she
rose
again
and
moved
closer
looking
at
him
with
a
certain
insolence
in
the
face--the
insolence
of
power
the
sun
had
set
behind
the
towers
of
the
old
cathedral
and
the
darkness
rose
up
from
the
plain
and
enveloped
them
the
music
of
the
band
had
ceased
the
leaves
of
the
plane
trees
hung
motionless
but
the
chill
of
the
autumn
evening
rose
about
them
and
made
vezin
shiver
there
was
no
sound
but
the
sound
of
their
voices
and
the
occasional
soft
rustle
of
the
girl's
dress
he
could
hear
the
blood
rushing
in
his
ears
he
scarcely
realised
where
he
was
or
what
he
was
doing
some
terrible
magic
of
the
imagination
drew
him
deeply
down
into
the
tombs
of
his
own
being
telling
him
in
no
unfaltering
voice
that
her
words
shadowed
forth
the
truth
and
this
simple
little
french
maid
speaking
beside
him
with
so
strange
authority
he
saw
curiously
alter
into
quite
another
being
as
he
stared
into
her
eyes
the
picture
in
his
mind
grew
and
lived
dressing
itself
vividly
to
his
inner
vision
with
a
degree
of
reality
he
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
as
once
before
he
saw
her
tall
and
stately
moving
through
wild
and
broken
scenery
of
forests
and
mountain
caverns
the
glare
of
flames
behind
her
head
and
clouds
of
shifting
smoke
about
her
feet
dark
leaves
encircled
her
hair
flying
loosely
in
the
wind
and
her
limbs
shone
through
the
merest
rags
of
clothing
others
were
about
her
too
and
ardent
eyes
on
all
sides
cast
delirious
glances
upon
her
but
her
own
eyes
were
always
for
one
only
one
whom
she
held
by
the
hand
for
she
was
leading
the
dance
in
some
tempestuous
orgy
to
the
music
of
chanting
voices
and
the
dance
she
led
circled
about
a
great
and
awful
figure
on
a
throne
brooding
over
the
scene
through
lurid
vapours
while
innumerable
other
wild
faces
and
forms
crowded
furiously
about
her
in
the
dance
but
the
one
she
held
by
the
hand
he
knew
to
be
himself
and
the
monstrous
shape
upon
the
throne
he
knew
to
be
her
mother
the
vision
rose
within
him
rushing
to
him
down
the
long
years
of
buried
time
crying
aloud
to
him
with
the
voice
of
memory
reawakened
and
then
the
scene
faded
away
and
he
saw
the
clear
circle
of
the
girl's
eyes
gazing
steadfastly
into
his
own
and
she
became
once
more
the
pretty
little
daughter
of
the
innkeeper
and
he
found
his
voice
again
and
you
he
whispered
tremblingly--you
child
of
visions
and
enchantment
how
is
it
that
you
so
bewitch
me
that
i
loved
you
even
before
i
saw
she
drew
herself
up
beside
him
with
an
air
of
rare
dignity
the
call
of
the
past
she
said
and
besides
she
added
proudly
in
the
real
life
i
am
a
princess--
a
princess
he
cried
--and
my
mother
is
a
queen
at
this
little
vezin
utterly
lost
his
head
delight
tore
at
his
heart
and
swept
him
into
sheer
ecstasy
to
hear
that
sweet
singing
voice
and
to
see
those
adorable
little
lips
utter
such
things
upset
his
balance
beyond
all
hope
of
control
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
covered
her
unresisting
face
with
kisses
but
even
while
he
did
so
and
while
the
hot
passion
swept
him
he
felt
that
she
was
soft
and
loathsome
and
that
her
answering
kisses
stained
his
very
soul
and
when
presently
she
had
freed
herself
and
vanished
into
the
darkness
he
stood
there
leaning
against
the
wall
in
a
state
of
collapse
creeping
with
horror
from
the
touch
of
her
yielding
body
and
inwardly
raging
at
the
weakness
that
he
already
dimly
realised
must
prove
his
undoing
and
from
the
shadows
of
the
old
buildings
into
which
she
disappeared
there
rose
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
a
singular
long-drawn
cry
which
at
first
he
took
for
laughter
but
which
later
he
was
sure
he
recognised
as
the
almost
human
wailing
of
a
cat
v
for
a
long
time
vezin
leant
there
against
the
wall
alone
with
his
surging
thoughts
and
emotions
he
understood
at
length
that
he
had
done
the
one
thing
necessary
to
call
down
upon
him
the
whole
force
of
this
ancient
past
for
in
those
passionate
kisses
he
had
acknowledged
the
tie
of
olden
days
and
had
revived
it
and
the
memory
of
that
soft
impalpable
caress
in
the
darkness
of
the
inn
corridor
came
back
to
him
with
a
shudder
the
girl
had
first
mastered
him
and
then
led
him
to
the
one
act
that
was
necessary
for
her
purpose
he
had
been
waylaid
after
the
lapse
of
centuries--caught
and
conquered
dimly
he
realised
this
and
sought
to
make
plans
for
his
escape
but
for
the
moment
at
any
rate
he
was
powerless
to
manage
his
thoughts
or
will
for
the
sweet
fantastic
madness
of
the
whole
adventure
mounted
to
his
brain
like
a
spell
and
he
gloried
in
the
feeling
that
he
was
utterly
enchanted
and
moving
in
a
world
so
much
larger
and
wilder
than
the
one
he
had
ever
been
accustomed
to
the
moon
pale
and
enormous
was
just
rising
over
the
sea-like
plain
when
at
last
he
rose
to
go
her
slanting
rays
drew
all
the
houses
into
new
perspective
so
that
their
roofs
already
glistening
with
dew
seemed
to
stretch
much
higher
into
the
sky
than
usual
and
their
gables
and
quaint
old
towers
lay
far
away
in
its
purple
reaches
the
cathedral
appeared
unreal
in
a
silver
mist
he
moved
softly
keeping
to
the
shadows
but
the
streets
were
all
deserted
and
very
silent
the
doors
were
closed
the
shutters
fastened
not
a
soul
was
astir
the
hush
of
night
lay
over
everything
it
was
like
a
town
of
the
dead
a
churchyard
with
gigantic
and
grotesque
tombstones
wondering
where
all
the
busy
life
of
the
day
had
so
utterly
disappeared
to
he
made
his
way
to
a
back
door
that
entered
the
inn
by
means
of
the
stables
thinking
thus
to
reach
his
room
unobserved
he
reached
the
courtyard
safely
and
crossed
it
by
keeping
close
to
the
shadow
of
the
wall
he
sidled
down
it
mincing
along
on
tiptoe
just
as
the
old
men
did
when
they
entered
the
salle

manger
he
was
horrified
to
find
himself
doing
this
instinctively
a
strange
impulse
came
to
him
catching
him
somehow
in
the
centre
of
his
body--an
impulse
to
drop
upon
all
fours
and
run
swiftly
and
silently
he
glanced
upwards
and
the
idea
came
to
him
to
leap
up
upon
his
window-sill
overhead
instead
of
going
round
by
the
stairs
this
occurred
to
him
as
the
easiest
and
most
natural
way
it
was
like
the
beginning
of
some
horrible
transformation
of
himself
into
something
else
he
was
fearfully
strung
up
the
moon
was
higher
now
and
the
shadows
very
dark
along
the
side
of
the
street
where
he
moved
he
kept
among
the
deepest
of
them
and
reached
the
porch
with
the
glass
doors
but
here
there
was
light
the
inmates
unfortunately
were
still
about
hoping
to
slip
across
the
hall
unobserved
and
reach
the
stairs
he
opened
the
door
carefully
and
stole
in
then
he
saw
that
the
hall
was
not
empty
a
large
dark
thing
lay
against
the
wall
on
his
left
at
first
he
thought
it
must
be
household
articles
then
it
moved
and
he
thought
it
was
an
immense
cat
distorted
in
some
way
by
the
play
of
light
and
shadow
then
it
rose
straight
up
before
him
and
he
saw
that
it
was
the
proprietress
what
she
had
been
doing
in
this
position
he
could
only
venture
a
dreadful
guess
but
the
moment
she
stood
up
and
faced
him
he
was
aware
of
some
terrible
dignity
clothing
her
about
that
instantly
recalled
the
girl's
strange
saying
that
she
was
a
queen
huge
and
sinister
she
stood
there
under
the
little
oil
lamp
alone
with
him
in
the
empty
hall
awe
stirred
in
his
heart
and
the
roots
of
some
ancient
fear
he
felt
that
he
must
bow
to
her
and
make
some
kind
of
obeisance
the
impulse
was
fierce
and
irresistible
as
of
long
habit
he
glanced
quickly
about
him
there
was
no
one
there
then
he
deliberately
inclined
his
head
toward
her
he
bowed
enfin
m'sieur
s'est
donc
dcid
c'est
bien
alors
j'en
suis
contente
her
words
came
to
him
sonorously
as
through
a
great
open
space
then
the
great
figure
came
suddenly
across
the
flagged
hall
at
him
and
seized
his
trembling
hands
some
overpowering
force
moved
with
her
and
caught
him
on
pourrait
faire
un
p'tit
tour
ensemble
n'est-ce
pas
nous
y
allons
cette
nuit
et
il
faut
s'exercer
un
peu
d'avance
pour
cela
ils
ils
viens
donc
ici
viens
vite
and
she
whirled
him
round
in
the
opening
steps
of
some
dance
that
seemed
oddly
and
horribly
familiar
they
made
no
sound
on
the
stones
this
strangely
assorted
couple
it
was
all
soft
and
stealthy
and
presently
when
the
air
seemed
to
thicken
like
smoke
and
a
red
glare
as
of
flame
shot
through
it
he
was
aware
that
some
one
else
had
joined
them
and
that
his
hand
the
mother
had
released
was
now
tightly
held
by
the
daughter
ils
had
come
in
answer
to
the
call
and
he
saw
her
with
leaves
of
vervain
twined
in
her
dark
hair
clothed
in
tattered
vestiges
of
some
curious
garment
beautiful
as
the
night
and
horribly
odiously
loathsomely
seductive
to
the
sabbath
to
the
sabbath
they
cried
on
to
the
witches'
sabbath
up
and
down
that
narrow
hall
they
danced
the
women
on
each
side
of
him
to
the
wildest
measure
he
had
ever
imagined
yet
which
he
dimly
dreadfully
remembered
till
the
lamp
on
the
wall
flickered
and
went
out
and
they
were
left
in
total
darkness
and
the
devil
woke
in
his
heart
with
a
thousand
vile
suggestions
and
made
him
afraid
suddenly
they
released
his
hands
and
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
mother
cry
that
it
was
time
and
they
must
go
which
way
they
went
he
did
not
pause
to
see
he
only
realised
that
he
was
free
and
he
blundered
through
the
darkness
till
he
found
the
stairs
and
then
tore
up
them
to
his
room
as
though
all
hell
was
at
his
heels
he
flung
himself
on
the
sofa
with
his
face
in
his
hands
and
groaned
swiftly
reviewing
a
dozen
ways
of
immediate
escape
all
equally
impossible
he
finally
decided
that
the
only
thing
to
do
for
the
moment
was
to
sit
quiet
and
wait
he
must
see
what
was
going
to
happen
at
least
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
bedroom
he
would
be
fairly
safe
the
door
was
locked
he
crossed
over
and
softly
opened
the
window
which
gave
upon
the
courtyard
and
also
permitted
a
partial
view
of
the
hall
through
the
glass
doors
as
he
did
so
the
hum
and
murmur
of
a
great
activity
reached
his
ears
from
the
streets
beyond--the
sound
of
footsteps
and
voices
muffled
by
distance
he
leaned
out
cautiously
and
listened
the
moonlight
was
clear
and
strong
now
but
his
own
window
was
in
shadow
the
silver
disc
being
still
behind
the
house
it
came
to
him
irresistibly
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
who
a
little
while
before
had
all
been
invisible
behind
closed
doors
were
now
issuing
forth
busy
upon
some
secret
and
unholy
errand
he
listened
intently
at
first
everything
about
him
was
silent
but
soon
he
became
aware
of
movements
going
on
in
the
house
itself
rustlings
and
cheepings
came
to
him
across
that
still
moonlit
yard
a
concourse
of
living
beings
sent
the
hum
of
their
activity
into
the
night
things
were
on
the
move
everywhere
a
biting
pungent
odour
rose
through
the
air
coming
he
knew
not
whence
presently
his
eyes
became
glued
to
the
windows
of
the
opposite
wall
where
the
moonshine
fell
in
a
soft
blaze
the
roof
overhead
and
behind
him
was
reflected
clearly
in
the
panes
of
glass
and
he
saw
the
outlines
of
dark
bodies
moving
with
long
footsteps
over
the
tiles
and
along
the
coping
they
passed
swiftly
and
silently
shaped
like
immense
cats
in
an
endless
procession
across
the
pictured
glass
and
then
appeared
to
leap
down
to
a
lower
level
where
he
lost
sight
of
them
he
just
caught
the
soft
thudding
of
their
leaps
sometimes
their
shadows
fell
upon
the
white
wall
opposite
and
then
he
could
not
make
out
whether
they
were
the
shadows
of
human
beings
or
of
cats
they
seemed
to
change
swiftly
from
one
to
the
other
the
transformation
looked
horribly
real
for
they
leaped
like
human
beings
yet
changed
swiftly
in
the
air
immediately
afterwards
and
dropped
like
animals
the
yard
too
beneath
him
was
now
alive
with
the
creeping
movements
of
dark
forms
all
stealthily
drawing
towards
the
porch
with
the
glass
doors
they
kept
so
closely
to
the
wall
that
he
could
not
determine
their
actual
shape
but
when
he
saw
that
they
passed
on
to
the
great
congregation
that
was
gathering
in
the
hall
he
understood
that
these
were
the
creatures
whose
leaping
shadows
he
had
first
seen
reflected
in
the
windowpanes
opposite
they
were
coming
from
all
parts
of
the
town
reaching
the
appointed
meeting-place
across
the
roofs
and
tiles
and
springing
from
level
to
level
till
they
came
to
the
yard
then
a
new
sound
caught
his
ear
and
he
saw
that
the
windows
all
about
him
were
being
softly
opened
and
that
to
each
window
came
a
face
a
moment
later
figures
began
dropping
hurriedly
down
into
the
yard
and
these
figures
as
they
lowered
themselves
down
from
the
windows
were
human
he
saw
but
once
safely
in
the
yard
they
fell
upon
all
fours
and
changed
in
the
swiftest
possible
second
into--cats--huge
silent
cats
they
ran
in
streams
to
join
the
main
body
in
the
hall
beyond
so
after
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
had
not
been
empty
and
unoccupied
moreover
what
he
saw
no
longer
filled
him
with
amazement
for
he
remembered
it
all
it
was
familiar
it
had
all
happened
before
just
so
hundreds
of
times
and
he
himself
had
taken
part
in
it
and
known
the
wild
madness
of
it
all
the
outline
of
the
old
building
changed
the
yard
grew
larger
and
he
seemed
to
be
staring
down
upon
it
from
a
much
greater
height
through
smoky
vapours
and
as
he
looked
half
remembering
the
old
pains
of
long
ago
fierce
and
sweet
furiously
assailed
him
and
the
blood
stirred
horribly
as
he
heard
the
call
of
the
dance
again
in
his
heart
and
tasted
the
ancient
magic
of
ils
whirling
by
his
side
suddenly
he
started
back
a
great
lithe
cat
had
leaped
softly
up
from
the
shadows
below
on
to
the
sill
close
to
his
face
and
was
staring
fixedly
at
him
with
the
eyes
of
a
human
come
it
seemed
to
say
come
with
us
to
the
dance
change
as
of
old
transform
yourself
swiftly
and
come
only
too
well
he
understood
the
creature's
soundless
call
it
was
gone
again
in
a
flash
with
scarcely
a
sound
of
its
padded
feet
on
the
stones
and
then
others
dropped
by
the
score
down
the
side
of
the
house
past
his
very
eyes
all
changing
as
they
fell
and
darting
away
rapidly
softly
towards
the
gathering
point
and
again
he
felt
the
dreadful
desire
to
do
likewise
to
murmur
the
old
incantation
and
then
drop
upon
hands
and
knees
and
run
swiftly
for
the
great
flying
leap
into
the
air
oh
how
the
passion
of
it
rose
within
him
like
a
flood
twisting
his
very
entrails
sending
his
heart's
desire
flaming
forth
into
the
night
for
the
old
old
dance
of
the
sorcerers
at
the
witches'
sabbath
the
whirl
of
the
stars
was
about
him
once
more
he
met
the
magic
of
the
moon
the
power
of
the
wind
rushing
from
precipice
and
forest
leaping
from
cliff
to
cliff
across
the
valleys
tore
him
away
he
heard
the
cries
of
the
dancers
and
their
wild
laughter
and
with
this
savage
girl
in
his
embrace
he
danced
furiously
about
the
dim
throne
where
sat
the
figure
with
the
sceptre
of
majesty
then
suddenly
all
became
hushed
and
still
and
the
fever
died
down
a
little
in
his
heart
the
calm
moonlight
flooded
a
courtyard
empty
and
deserted
they
had
started
the
procession
was
off
into
the
sky
and
he
was
left
behind--alone
vezin
tiptoed
softly
across
the
room
and
unlocked
the
door
the
murmur
from
the
streets
growing
momentarily
as
he
advanced
met
his
ears
he
made
his
way
with
the
utmost
caution
down
the
corridor
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
he
paused
and
listened
below
him
the
hall
where
they
had
gathered
was
dark
and
still
but
through
opened
doors
and
windows
on
the
far
side
of
the
building
came
the
sound
of
a
great
throng
moving
farther
and
farther
into
the
distance
he
made
his
way
down
the
creaking
wooden
stairs
dreading
yet
longing
to
meet
some
straggler
who
should
point
the
way
but
finding
no
one
across
the
dark
hall
so
lately
thronged
with
living
moving
things
and
out
through
the
opened
front
doors
into
the
street
he
could
not
believe
that
he
was
really
left
behind
really
forgotten
that
he
had
been
purposely
permitted
to
escape
it
perplexed
him
nervously
he
peered
about
him
and
up
and
down
the
street
then
seeing
nothing
advanced
slowly
down
the
pavement
the
whole
town
as
he
went
showed
itself
empty
and
deserted
as
though
a
great
wind
had
blown
everything
alive
out
of
it
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
houses
stood
open
to
the
night
nothing
stirred
moonlight
and
silence
lay
over
all
the
night
lay
about
him
like
a
cloak
the
air
soft
and
cool
caressed
his
cheek
like
the
touch
of
a
great
furry
paw
he
gained
confidence
and
began
to
walk
quickly
though
still
keeping
to
the
shadowed
side
nowhere
could
he
discover
the
faintest
sign
of
the
great
unholy
exodus
he
knew
had
just
taken
place
the
moon
sailed
high
over
all
in
a
sky
cloudless
and
serene
hardly
realising
where
he
was
going
he
crossed
the
open
market-place
and
so
came
to
the
ramparts
whence
he
knew
a
pathway
descended
to
the
high
road
and
along
which
he
could
make
good
his
escape
to
one
of
the
other
little
towns
that
lay
to
the
northward
and
so
to
the
railway
but
first
he
paused
and
gazed
out
over
the
scene
at
his
feet
where
the
great
plain
lay
like
a
silver
map
of
some
dream
country
the
still
beauty
of
it
entered
his
heart
increasing
his
sense
of
bewilderment
and
unreality
no
air
stirred
the
leaves
of
the
plane
trees
stood
motionless
the
near
details
were
defined
with
the
sharpness
of
day
against
dark
shadows
and
in
the
distance
the
fields
and
woods
melted
away
into
haze
and
shimmering
mistiness
but
the
breath
caught
in
his
throat
and
he
stood
stockstill
as
though
transfixed
when
his
gaze
passed
from
the
horizon
and
fell
upon
the
near
prospect
in
the
depth
of
the
valley
at
his
feet
the
whole
lower
slopes
of
the
hill
that
lay
hid
from
the
brightness
of
the
moon
were
aglow
and
through
the
glare
he
saw
countless
moving
forms
shifting
thick
and
fast
between
the
openings
of
the
trees
while
overhead
like
leaves
driven
by
the
wind
he
discerned
flying
shapes
that
hovered
darkly
one
moment
against
the
sky
and
then
settled
down
with
cries
and
weird
singing
through
the
branches
into
the
region
that
was
aflame
spellbound
he
stood
and
stared
for
a
time
that
he
could
not
measure
and
then
moved
by
one
of
the
terrible
impulses
that
seemed
to
control
the
whole
adventure
he
climbed
swiftly
upon
the
top
of
the
broad
coping
and
balanced
a
moment
where
the
valley
gaped
at
his
feet
but
in
that
very
instant
as
he
stood
hovering
a
sudden
movement
among
the
shadows
of
the
houses
caught
his
eye
and
he
turned
to
see
the
outline
of
a
large
animal
dart
swiftly
across
the
open
space
behind
him
and
land
with
a
flying
leap
upon
the
top
of
the
wall
a
little
lower
down
it
ran
like
the
wind
to
his
feet
and
then
rose
up
beside
him
upon
the
ramparts
a
shiver
seemed
to
run
through
the
moonlight
and
his
sight
trembled
for
a
second
his
heart
pulsed
fearfully
ils
stood
beside
him
peering
into
his
face
some
dark
substance
he
saw
stained
the
girl's
face
and
skin
shining
in
the
moonlight
as
she
stretched
her
hands
towards
him
she
was
dressed
in
wretched
tattered
garments
that
yet
became
her
mightily
rue
and
vervain
twined
about
her
temples
her
eyes
glittered
with
unholy
light
he
only
just
controlled
the
wild
impulse
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
leap
with
her
from
their
giddy
perch
into
the
valley
below
see
she
cried
pointing
with
an
arm
on
which
the
rags
fluttered
in
the
rising
wind
towards
the
forest
aglow
in
the
distance
see
where
they
await
us
the
woods
are
alive
already
the
great
ones
are
there
and
the
dance
will
soon
begin
the
salve
is
here
anoint
yourself
and
come
though
a
moment
before
the
sky
was
clear
and
cloudless
yet
even
while
she
spoke
the
face
of
the
moon
grew
dark
and
the
wind
began
to
toss
in
the
crests
of
the
plane
trees
at
his
feet
stray
gusts
brought
the
sounds
of
hoarse
singing
and
crying
from
the
lower
slopes
of
the
hill
and
the
pungent
odour
he
had
already
noticed
about
the
courtyard
of
the
inn
rose
about
him
in
the
air
transform
transform
she
cried
again
her
voice
rising
like
a
song
rub
well
your
skin
before
you
fly
come
come
with
me
to
the
sabbath
to
the
madness
of
its
furious
delight
to
the
sweet
abandonment
of
its
evil
worship
see
the
great
ones
are
there
and
the
terrible
sacraments
prepared
the
throne
is
occupied
anoint
and
come
anoint
and
come
she
grew
to
the
height
of
a
tree
beside
him
leaping
upon
the
wall
with
flaming
eyes
and
hair
strewn
upon
the
night
he
too
began
to
change
swiftly
her
hands
touched
the
skin
of
his
face
and
neck
streaking
him
with
the
burning
salve
that
sent
the
old
magic
into
his
blood
with
the
power
before
which
fades
all
that
is
good
a
wild
roar
came
up
to
his
ears
from
the
heart
of
the
wood
and
the
girl
when
she
heard
it
leaped
upon
the
wall
in
the
frenzy
of
her
wicked
joy
satan
is
there
she
screamed
rushing
upon
him
and
striving
to
draw
him
with
her
to
the
edge
of
the
wall
satan
has
come
the
sacraments
call
us
come
with
your
dear
apostate
soul
and
we
will
worship
and
dance
till
the
moon
dies
and
the
world
is
forgotten
just
saving
himself
from
the
dreadful
plunge
vezin
struggled
to
release
himself
from
her
grasp
while
the
passion
tore
at
his
reins
and
all
but
mastered
him
he
shrieked
aloud
not
knowing
what
he
said
and
then
he
shrieked
again
it
was
the
old
impulses
the
old
awful
habits
instinctively
finding
voice
for
though
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
merely
shrieked
nonsense
the
words
he
uttered
really
had
meaning
in
them
and
were
intelligible
it
was
the
ancient
call
and
it
was
heard
below
it
was
answered
the
wind
whistled
at
the
skirts
of
his
coat
as
the
air
round
him
darkened
with
many
flying
forms
crowding
upwards
out
of
the
valley
the
crying
of
hoarse
voices
smote
upon
his
ears
coming
closer
strokes
of
wind
buffeted
him
tearing
him
this
way
and
that
along
the
crumbling
top
of
the
stone
wall
and
ils
clung
to
him
with
her
long
shining
arms
smooth
and
bare
holding
him
fast
about
the
neck
but
not
ils
alone
for
a
dozen
of
them
surrounded
him
dropping
out
of
the
air
the
pungent
odour
of
the
anointed
bodies
stifled
him
exciting
him
to
the
old
madness
of
the
sabbath
the
dance
of
the
witches
and
sorcerers
doing
honour
to
the
personified
evil
of
the
world
anoint
and
away
anoint
and
away
they
cried
in
wild
chorus
about
him
to
the
dance
that
never
dies
to
the
sweet
and
fearful
fantasy
of
evil
another
moment
and
he
would
have
yielded
and
gone
for
his
will
turned
soft
and
the
flood
of
passionate
memory
all
but
overwhelmed
him
when--so
can
a
small
thing
after
the
whole
course
of
an
adventure--he
caught
his
foot
upon
a
loose
stone
in
the
edge
of
the
wall
and
then
fell
with
a
sudden
crash
on
to
the
ground
below
but
he
fell
towards
the
houses
in
the
open
space
of
dust
and
cobblestones
and
fortunately
not
into
the
gaping
depth
of
the
valley
on
the
farther
side
and
they
too
came
in
a
tumbling
heap
about
him
like
flies
upon
a
piece
of
food
but
as
they
fell
he
was
released
for
a
moment
from
the
power
of
their
touch
and
in
that
brief
instant
of
freedom
there
flashed
into
his
mind
the
sudden
intuition
that
saved
him
before
he
could
regain
his
feet
he
saw
them
scrabbling
awkwardly
back
upon
the
wall
as
though
bat-like
they
could
only
fly
by
dropping
from
a
height
and
had
no
hold
upon
him
in
the
open
then
seeing
them
perched
there
in
a
row
like
cats
upon
a
roof
all
dark
and
singularly
shapeless
their
eyes
like
lamps
the
sudden
memory
came
back
to
him
of
ils's
terror
at
the
sight
of
fire
quick
as
a
flash
he
found
his
matches
and
lit
the
dead
leaves
that
lay
under
the
wall
dry
and
withered
they
caught
fire
at
once
and
the
wind
carried
the
flame
in
a
long
line
down
the
length
of
the
wall
licking
upwards
as
it
ran
and
with
shrieks
and
wailings
the
crowded
row
of
forms
upon
the
top
melted
away
into
the
air
on
the
other
side
and
were
gone
with
a
great
rush
and
whirring
of
their
bodies
down
into
the
heart
of
the
haunted
valley
leaving
vezin
breathless
and
shaken
in
the
middle
of
the
deserted
ground
ils
he
called
feebly
ils
for
his
heart
ached
to
think
that
she
was
really
gone
to
the
great
dance
without
him
and
that
he
had
lost
the
opportunity
of
its
fearful
joy
yet
at
the
same
time
his
relief
was
so
great
and
he
was
so
dazed
and
troubled
in
mind
with
the
whole
thing
that
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
saying
and
only
cried
aloud
in
the
fierce
storm
of
his
emotion
the
fire
under
the
wall
ran
its
course
and
the
moonlight
came
out
again
soft
and
clear
from
its
temporary
eclipse
with
one
last
shuddering
look
at
the
ruined
ramparts
and
a
feeling
of
horrid
wonder
for
the
haunted
valley
beyond
where
the
shapes
still
crowded
and
flew
he
turned
his
face
towards
the
town
and
slowly
made
his
way
in
the
direction
of
the
hotel
and
as
he
went
a
great
wailing
of
cries
and
a
sound
of
howling
followed
him
from
the
gleaming
forest
below
growing
fainter
and
fainter
with
the
bursts
of
wind
as
he
disappeared
between
the
houses
vi
it
may
seem
rather
abrupt
to
you
this
sudden
tame
ending
said
arthur
vezin
glancing
with
flushed
face
and
timid
eyes
at
dr
silence
sitting
there
with
his
notebook
but
the
fact
is--er--from
that
moment
my
memory
seems
to
have
failed
rather
i
have
no
distinct
recollection
of
how
i
got
home
or
what
precisely
i
did
it
appears
i
never
went
back
to
the
inn
at
all
i
only
dimly
recollect
racing
down
a
long
white
road
in
the
moonlight
past
woods
and
villages
still
and
deserted
and
then
the
dawn
came
up
and
i
saw
the
towers
of
a
biggish
town
and
so
came
to
a
station
but
long
before
that
i
remember
pausing
somewhere
on
the
road
and
looking
back
to
where
the
hill-town
of
my
adventure
stood
up
in
the
moonlight
and
thinking
how
exactly
like
a
great
monstrous
cat
it
lay
there
upon
the
plain
its
huge
front
paws
lying
down
the
two
main
streets
and
the
twin
and
broken
towers
of
the
cathedral
marking
its
torn
ears
against
the
sky
that
picture
stays
in
my
mind
with
the
utmost
vividness
to
this
day
another
thing
remains
in
my
mind
from
that
escape--namely
the
sudden
sharp
reminder
that
i
had
not
paid
my
bill
and
the
decision
i
made
standing
there
on
the
dusty
highroad
that
the
small
baggage
i
had
left
behind
would
more
than
settle
for
my
indebtedness
for
the
rest
i
can
only
tell
you
that
i
got
coffee
and
bread
at
a
caf
on
the
outskirts
of
this
town
i
had
come
to
and
soon
after
found
my
way
to
the
station
and
caught
a
train
later
in
the
day
that
same
evening
i
reached
london
and
how
long
altogether
asked
john
silence
quietly
do
you
think
you
stayed
in
the
town
of
the
adventure
vezin
looked
up
sheepishly
i
was
coming
to
that
he
resumed
with
apologetic
wrigglings
of
his
body
in
london
i
found
that
i
was
a
whole
week
out
in
my
reckoning
of
time
i
had
stayed
over
a
week
in
the
town
and
it
ought
to
have
been
september
15th--instead
of
which
it
was
only
september
10th
so
that
in
reality
you
had
only
stayed
a
night
or
two
in
the
inn
queried
the
doctor
vezin
hesitated
before
replying
he
shuffled
upon
the
mat
i
must
have
gained
time
somewhere
he
said
at
length--somewhere
or
somehow
i
certainly
had
a
week
to
my
credit
i
can't
explain
it
i
can
only
give
you
the
fact
and
this
happened
to
you
last
year
since
when
you
have
never
been
back
to
the
place
last
autumn
yes
murmured
vezin
and
i
have
never
dared
to
go
back
i
think
i
never
want
to
and
tell
me
asked
dr
silence
at
length
when
he
saw
that
the
little
man
had
evidently
come
to
the
end
of
his
words
and
had
nothing
more
to
say
had
you
ever
read
up
the
subject
of
the
old
witchcraft
practices
during
the
middle
ages
or
been
at
all
interested
in
the
subject
never
declared
vezin
emphatically
i
had
never
given
a
thought
to
such
matters
so
far
as
i
know--
or
to
the
question
of
reincarnation
perhaps
never--before
my
adventure
but
i
have
since
he
replied
significantly
there
was
however
something
still
on
the
man's
mind
that
he
wished
to
relieve
himself
of
by
confession
yet
could
only
with
difficulty
bring
himself
to
mention
and
it
was
only
after
the
sympathetic
tactfulness
of
the
doctor
had
provided
numerous
openings
that
he
at
length
availed
himself
of
one
of
them
and
stammered
that
he
would
like
to
show
him
the
marks
he
still
had
on
his
neck
where
he
said
the
girl
had
touched
him
with
her
anointed
hands
he
took
off
his
collar
after
infinite
fumbling
hesitation
and
lowered
his
shirt
a
little
for
the
doctor
to
see
and
there
on
the
surface
of
the
skin
lay
a
faint
reddish
line
across
the
shoulder
and
extending
a
little
way
down
the
back
towards
the
spine
it
certainly
indicated
exactly
the
position
an
arm
might
have
taken
in
the
act
of
embracing
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
neck
slightly
higher
up
was
a
similar
mark
though
not
quite
so
clearly
defined
that
was
where
she
held
me
that
night
on
the
ramparts
he
whispered
a
strange
light
coming
and
going
in
his
eyes





it
was
some
weeks
later
when
i
again
found
occasion
to
consult
john
silence
concerning
another
extraordinary
case
that
had
come
under
my
notice
and
we
fell
to
discussing
vezin's
story
since
hearing
it
the
doctor
had
made
investigations
on
his
own
account
and
one
of
his
secretaries
had
discovered
that
vezin's
ancestors
had
actually
lived
for
generations
in
the
very
town
where
the
adventure
came
to
him
two
of
them
both
women
had
been
tried
and
convicted
as
witches
and
had
been
burned
alive
at
the
stake
moreover
it
had
not
been
difficult
to
prove
that
the
very
inn
where
vezin
stayed
was
built
about
1700
upon
the
spot
where
the
funeral
pyres
stood
and
the
executions
took
place
the
town
was
a
sort
of
headquarters
for
all
the
sorcerers
and
witches
of
the
entire
region
and
after
conviction
they
were
burnt
there
literally
by
scores
it
seems
strange
continued
the
doctor
that
vezin
should
have
remained
ignorant
of
all
this
but
on
the
other
hand
it
was
not
the
kind
of
history
that
successive
generations
would
have
been
anxious
to
keep
alive
or
to
repeat
to
their
children
therefore
i
am
inclined
to
think
he
still
knows
nothing
about
it
the
whole
adventure
seems
to
have
been
a
very
vivid
revival
of
the
memories
of
an
earlier
life
caused
by
coming
directly
into
contact
with
the
living
forces
still
intense
enough
to
hang
about
the
place
and
by
a
most
singular
chance
too
with
the
very
souls
who
had
taken
part
with
him
in
the
events
of
that
particular
life
for
the
mother
and
daughter
who
impressed
him
so
strangely
must
have
been
leading
actors
with
himself
in
the
scenes
and
practices
of
witchcraft
which
at
that
period
dominated
the
imaginations
of
the
whole
country
one
has
only
to
read
the
histories
of
the
times
to
know
that
these
witches
claimed
the
power
of
transforming
themselves
into
various
animals
both
for
the
purposes
of
disguise
and
also
to
convey
themselves
swiftly
to
the
scenes
of
their
imaginary
orgies
lycanthropy
or
the
power
to
change
themselves
into
wolves
was
everywhere
believed
in
and
the
ability
to
transform
themselves
into
cats
by
rubbing
their
bodies
with
a
special
salve
or
ointment
provided
by
satan
himself
found
equal
credence
the
witchcraft
trials
abound
in
evidences
of
such
universal
beliefs
dr
silence
quoted
chapter
and
verse
from
many
writers
on
the
subject
and
showed
how
every
detail
of
vezin's
adventure
had
a
basis
in
the
practices
of
those
dark
days
but
that
the
entire
affair
took
place
subjectively
in
the
man's
own
consciousness
i
have
no
doubt
he
went
on
in
reply
to
my
questions
for
my
secretary
who
has
been
to
the
town
to
investigate
discovered
his
signature
in
the
visitors'
book
and
proved
by
it
that
he
had
arrived
on
september
8th
and
left
suddenly
without
paying
his
bill
he
left
two
days
later
and
they
still
were
in
possession
of
his
dirty
brown
bag
and
some
tourist
clothes
i
paid
a
few
francs
in
settlement
of
his
debt
and
have
sent
his
luggage
on
to
him
the
daughter
was
absent
from
home
but
the
proprietress
a
large
woman
very
much
as
he
described
her
told
my
secretary
that
he
had
seemed
a
very
strange
absent-minded
kind
of
gentleman
and
after
his
disappearance
she
had
feared
for
a
long
time
that
he
had
met
with
a
violent
end
in
the
neighbouring
forest
where
he
used
to
roam
about
alone
i
should
like
to
have
obtained
a
personal
interview
with
the
daughter
so
as
to
ascertain
how
much
was
subjective
and
how
much
actually
took
place
with
her
as
vezin
told
it
for
her
dread
of
fire
and
the
sight
of
burning
must
of
course
have
been
the
intuitive
memory
of
her
former
painful
death
at
the
stake
and
have
thus
explained
why
he
fancied
more
than
once
that
he
saw
her
through
smoke
and
flame
and
that
mark
on
his
skin
for
instance
i
inquired
merely
the
marks
produced
by
hysterical
brooding
he
replied
like
the
stigmata
of
the
religieuses
and
the
bruises
which
appear
on
the
bodies
of
hypnotised
subjects
who
have
been
told
to
expect
them
this
is
very
common
and
easily
explained
only
it
seems
curious
that
these
marks
should
have
remained
so
long
in
vezin's
case
usually
they
disappear
quickly
obviously
he
is
still
thinking
about
it
all
brooding
and
living
it
all
over
again
i
ventured
probably
and
this
makes
me
fear
that
the
end
of
his
trouble
is
not
yet
we
shall
hear
of
him
again
it
is
a
case
alas
i
can
do
little
to
alleviate
dr
silence
spoke
gravely
and
with
sadness
in
his
voice
and
what
do
you
make
of
the
frenchman
in
the
train
i
asked
further--the
man
who
warned
him
against
the
place

cause
du
sommeil
et

cause
des
chats
surely
a
very
singular
incident
a
very
singular
incident
indeed
he
made
answer
slowly
and
one
i
can
only
explain
on
the
basis
of
a
highly
improbable
coincidence--
namely
that
the
man
was
one
who
had
himself
stayed
in
the
town
and
undergone
there
a
similar
experience
i
should
like
to
find
this
man
and
ask
him
but
the
crystal
is
useless
here
for
i
have
no
slightest
clue
to
go
upon
and
i
can
only
conclude
that
some
singular
psychic
affinity
some
force
still
active
in
his
being
out
of
the
same
past
life
drew
him
thus
to
the
personality
of
vezin
and
enabled
him
to
fear
what
might
happen
to
him
and
thus
to
warn
him
as
he
did
yes
he
presently
continued
half
talking
to
himself
i
suspect
in
this
case
that
vezin
was
swept
into
the
vortex
of
forces
arising
out
of
the
intense
activities
of
a
past
life
and
that
he
lived
over
again
a
scene
in
which
he
had
often
played
a
leading
part
centuries
before
for
strong
actions
set
up
forces
that
are
so
slow
to
exhaust
themselves
they
may
be
said
in
a
sense
never
to
die
in
this
case
they
were
not
vital
enough
to
render
the
illusion
complete
so
that
the
little
man
found
himself
caught
in
a
very
distressing
confusion
of
the
present
and
the
past
yet
he
was
sufficiently
sensitive
to
recognise
that
it
was
true
and
to
fight
against
the
degradation
of
returning
even
in
memory
to
a
former
and
lower
state
of
development
ah
yes
he
continued
crossing
the
floor
to
gaze
at
the
darkening
sky
and
seemingly
quite
oblivious
of
my
presence
subliminal
up-rushes
of
memory
like
this
can
be
exceedingly
painful
and
sometimes
exceedingly
dangerous
i
only
trust
that
this
gentle
soul
may
soon
escape
from
this
obsession
of
a
passionate
and
tempestuous
past
but
i
doubt
it
i
doubt
it
his
voice
was
hushed
with
sadness
as
he
spoke
and
when
he
turned
back
into
the
room
again
there
was
an
expression
of
profound
yearning
upon
his
face
the
yearning
of
a
soul
whose
desire
to
help
is
sometimes
greater
than
his
power
case
iii
the
nemesis
of
fire
i
by
some
means
which
i
never
could
fathom
john
silence
always
contrived
to
keep
the
compartment
to
himself
and
as
the
train
had
a
clear
run
of
two
hours
before
the
first
stop
there
was
ample
time
to
go
over
the
preliminary
facts
of
the
case
he
had
telephoned
to
me
that
very
morning
and
even
through
the
disguise
of
the
miles
of
wire
the
thrill
of
incalculable
adventure
had
sounded
in
his
voice
as
if
it
were
an
ordinary
country
visit
he
called
in
reply
to
my
question
and
don't
forgot
to
bring
your
gun
with
blank
cartridges
i
suppose
for
i
knew
his
rigid
principles
with
regard
to
the
taking
of
life
and
guessed
that
the
guns
were
merely
for
some
obvious
purpose
of
disguise
then
he
thanked
me
for
coming
mentioned
the
train
snapped
down
the
receiver
and
left
me
vibrating
with
the
excitement
of
anticipation
to
do
my
packing
for
the
honour
of
accompanying
dr
john
silence
on
one
of
his
big
cases
was
what
many
would
have
considered
an
empty
honour--and
risky
certainly
the
adventure
held
all
manner
of
possibilities
and
i
arrived
at
waterloo
with
the
feelings
of
a
man
who
is
about
to
embark
on
some
dangerous
and
peculiar
mission
in
which
the
dangers
he
expects
to
run
will
not
be
the
ordinary
dangers
to
life
and
limb
but
of
some
secret
character
difficult
to
name
and
still
more
difficult
to
cope
with
the
manor
house
has
a
high
sound
he
told
me
as
we
sat
with
our
feet
up
and
talked
but
i
believe
it
is
little
more
than
an
overgrown
farmhouse
in
the
desolate
heather
country
beyond
d----
and
its
owner
colonel
wragge
a
retired
soldier
with
a
taste
for
books
lives
there
practically
alone
i
understand
with
an
elderly
invalid
sister
so
you
need
not
look
forward
to
a
lively
visit
unless
the
case
provides
some
excitement
of
its
own
which
is
likely
by
way
of
reply
he
handed
me
a
letter
marked
private
it
was
dated
a
week
ago
and
signed
yours
faithfully
horace
wragge
he
heard
of
me
you
see
through
captain
anderson
the
doctor
explained
modestly
as
though
his
fame
were
not
almost
world-wide
you
remember
that
indian
obsession
case--
i
read
the
letter
why
it
should
have
been
marked
private
was
difficult
to
understand
it
was
very
brief
direct
and
to
the
point
it
referred
by
way
of
introduction
to
captain
anderson
and
then
stated
quite
simply
that
the
writer
needed
help
of
a
peculiar
kind
and
asked
for
a
personal
interview--a
morning
interview
since
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
be
absent
from
the
house
at
night
the
letter
was
dignified
even
to
the
point
of
abruptness
and
it
is
difficult
to
explain
how
it
managed
to
convey
to
me
the
impression
of
a
strong
man
shaken
and
perplexed
perhaps
the
restraint
of
the
wording
and
the
mystery
of
the
affair
had
something
to
do
with
it
and
the
reference
to
the
anderson
case
the
horror
of
which
lay
still
vivid
in
my
memory
may
have
touched
the
sense
of
something
rather
ominous
and
alarming
but
whatever
the
cause
there
was
no
doubt
that
an
impression
of
serious
peril
rose
somehow
out
of
that
white
paper
with
the
few
lines
of
firm
writing
and
the
spirit
of
a
deep
uneasiness
ran
between
the
words
and
reached
the
mind
without
any
visible
form
of
expression
and
when
you
saw
him--
i
asked
returning
the
letter
as
the
train
rushed
clattering
noisily
through
clapham
junction
i
have
not
seen
him
was
the
reply
the
man's
mind
was
charged
to
the
brim
when
he
wrote
that
full
of
vivid
mental
pictures
notice
the
restraint
of
it
for
the
main
character
of
his
case
psychometry
could
be
depended
upon
and
the
scrap
of
paper
his
hand
has
touched
is
sufficient
to
give
to
another
mind--a
sensitive
and
sympathetic
mind--clear
mental
pictures
of
what
is
going
on
i
think
i
have
a
very
sound
general
idea
of
his
problem
so
there
may
be
excitement
after
all
john
silence
waited
a
moment
before
he
replied
something
very
serious
is
amiss
there
he
said
gravely
at
length
some
one--not
himself
i
gather--has
been
meddling
with
a
rather
dangerous
kind
of
gunpowder
so--yes
there
may
be
excitement
as
you
put
it
and
my
duties
i
asked
with
a
decidedly
growing
interest
remember
i
am
your
'assistant'
behave
like
an
intelligent
confidential
secretary
observe
everything
without
seeming
to
say
nothing--nothing
that
means
anything
be
present
at
all
interviews
i
may
ask
a
good
deal
of
you
for
if
my
impressions
are
correct
this
is--
he
broke
off
suddenly
but
i
won't
tell
you
my
impressions
yet
he
resumed
after
a
moment's
thought
just
watch
and
listen
as
the
case
proceeds
form
your
own
impressions
and
cultivate
your
intuitions
we
come
as
ordinary
visitors
of
course
he
added
a
twinkle
showing
for
an
instant
in
his
eye
hence
the
guns
though
disappointed
not
to
hear
more
i
recognised
the
wisdom
of
his
words
and
knew
how
valueless
my
impressions
would
be
once
the
powerful
suggestion
of
having
heard
his
own
lay
behind
them
i
likewise
reflected
that
intuition
joined
to
a
sense
of
humour
was
of
more
use
to
a
man
than
double
the
quantity
of
mere
brains
as
such
before
putting
the
letter
away
however
he
handed
it
back
telling
me
to
place
it
against
my
forehead
for
a
few
moments
and
then
describe
any
pictures
that
came
spontaneously
into
my
mind
don't
deliberately
look
for
anything
just
imagine
you
see
the
inside
of
the
eyelid
and
wait
for
pictures
that
rise
against
its
dark
screen
i
followed
his
instructions
making
my
mind
as
nearly
blank
as
possible
but
no
visions
came
i
saw
nothing
but
the
lines
of
light
that
pass
to
and
fro
like
the
changes
of
a
kaleidoscope
across
the
blackness
a
momentary
sensation
of
warmth
came
and
went
curiously
you
see--what
he
asked
presently
nothing
i
was
obliged
to
admit
disappointedly
nothing
but
the
usual
flashes
of
light
one
always
sees
only
perhaps
they
are
more
vivid
than
usual
he
said
nothing
by
way
of
comment
or
reply
and
they
group
themselves
now
and
then
i
continued
with
painful
candour
for
i
longed
to
see
the
pictures
he
had
spoken
of
group
themselves
into
globes
and
round
balls
of
fire
and
the
lines
that
flash
about
sometimes
look
like
triangles
and
crosses--almost
like
geometrical
figures
nothing
more
i
opened
my
eyes
again
and
gave
him
back
the
letter
it
makes
my
head
hot
i
said
feeling
somehow
unworthy
for
not
seeing
anything
of
interest
but
the
look
in
his
eyes
arrested
my
attention
at
once
that
sensation
of
heat
is
important
he
said
significantly
it
was
certainly
real
and
rather
uncomfortable
i
replied
hoping
he
would
expand
and
explain
there
was
a
distinct
feeling
of
warmth--internal
warmth
somewhere--oppressive
in
a
sense
that
is
interesting
he
remarked
putting
the
letter
back
in
his
pocket
and
settling
himself
in
the
corner
with
newspapers
and
books
he
vouchsafed
nothing
more
and
i
knew
the
uselessness
of
trying
to
make
him
talk
following
his
example
i
settled
likewise
with
magazines
into
my
corner
but
when
i
closed
my
eyes
again
to
look
for
the
flashing
lights
and
the
sensation
of
heat
i
found
nothing
but
the
usual
phantasmagoria
of
the
day's
events--faces
scenes
memories--and
in
due
course
i
fell
asleep
and
then
saw
nothing
at
all
of
any
kind
when
we
left
the
train
after
six
hours'
travelling
at
a
little
wayside
station
standing
without
trees
in
a
world
of
sand
and
heather
the
late
october
shadows
had
already
dropped
their
sombre
veil
upon
the
landscape
and
the
sun
dipped
almost
out
of
sight
behind
the
moorland
hills
in
a
high
dogcart
behind
a
fast
horse
we
were
soon
rattling
across
the
undulating
stretches
of
an
open
and
bleak
country
the
keen
air
stinging
our
cheeks
and
the
scents
of
pine
and
bracken
strong
about
us
bare
hills
were
faintly
visible
against
the
horizon
and
the
coachman
pointed
to
a
bank
of
distant
shadows
on
our
left
where
he
told
us
the
sea
lay
occasional
stone
farmhouses
standing
back
from
the
road
among
straggling
fir
trees
and
large
black
barns
that
seemed
to
shift
past
us
with
a
movement
of
their
own
in
the
gloom
were
the
only
signs
of
humanity
and
civilisation
that
we
saw
until
at
the
end
of
a
bracing
five
miles
the
lights
of
the
lodge
gates
flared
before
us
and
we
plunged
into
a
thick
grove
of
pine
trees
that
concealed
the
manor
house
up
to
the
moment
of
actual
arrival
colonel
wragge
himself
met
us
in
the
hall
he
was
the
typical
army
officer
who
had
seen
service
real
service
and
found
himself
in
the
process
he
was
tall
and
well
built
broad
in
the
shoulders
but
lean
as
a
greyhound
with
grave
eyes
rather
stern
and
a
moustache
turning
grey
i
judged
him
to
be
about
sixty
years
of
age
but
his
movements
showed
a
suppleness
of
strength
and
agility
that
contradicted
the
years
the
face
was
full
of
character
and
resolution
the
face
of
a
man
to
be
depended
upon
and
the
straight
grey
eyes
it
seemed
to
me
wore
a
veil
of
perplexed
anxiety
that
he
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
the
whole
appearance
of
the
man
at
once
clothed
the
adventure
with
gravity
and
importance
a
matter
that
gave
such
a
man
cause
for
serious
alarm
i
felt
must
be
something
real
and
of
genuine
moment
his
speech
and
manner
as
he
welcomed
us
were
like
his
letter
simple
and
sincere
he
had
a
nature
as
direct
and
undeviating
as
a
bullet
thus
he
showed
plainly
his
surprise
that
dr
silence
had
not
come
alone
my
confidential
secretary
mr
hubbard
the
doctor
said
introducing
me
and
the
steady
gaze
and
powerful
shake
of
the
hand
i
then
received
were
well
calculated
i
remember
thinking
to
drive
home
the
impression
that
here
was
a
man
who
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
and
whose
perplexity
must
spring
from
some
very
real
and
tangible
cause
and
quite
obviously
he
was
relieved
that
we
had
come
his
welcome
was
unmistakably
genuine
he
led
us
at
once
into
a
room
half
library
half
smoking-room
that
opened
out
of
the
low-ceilinged
hall
the
manor
house
gave
the
impression
of
a
rambling
and
glorified
farmhouse
solid
ancient
comfortable
and
wholly
unpretentious
and
so
it
was
only
the
heat
of
the
place
struck
me
as
unnatural
this
room
with
the
blazing
fire
may
have
seemed
uncomfortably
warm
after
the
long
drive
through
the
night
air
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
hall
itself
and
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
house
breathed
a
warmth
that
hardly
belonged
to
well-filled
grates
or
the
pipes
of
hot
air
and
water
it
was
not
the
heat
of
the
greenhouse
it
was
an
oppressive
heat
that
somehow
got
into
the
head
and
mind
it
stirred
a
curious
sense
of
uneasiness
in
me
and
i
caught
myself
thinking
of
the
sensation
of
warmth
that
had
emanated
from
the
letter
in
the
train
i
heard
him
thanking
dr
silence
for
having
come
there
was
no
preamble
and
the
exchange
of
civilities
was
of
the
briefest
description
evidently
here
was
a
man
who
like
my
companion
loved
action
rather
than
talk
his
manner
was
straightforward
and
direct
i
saw
him
in
a
flash
puzzled
worried
harassed
into
a
state
of
alarm
by
something
he
could
not
comprehend
forced
to
deal
with
things
he
would
have
preferred
to
despise
yet
facing
it
all
with
dogged
seriousness
and
making
no
attempt
to
conceal
that
he
felt
secretly
ashamed
of
his
incompetence
so
i
cannot
offer
you
much
entertainment
beyond
that
of
my
own
company
and
the
queer
business
that
has
been
going
on
here
and
is
still
going
on
he
said
with
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
towards
me
by
way
of
including
me
in
his
confidence
i
think
colonel
wragge
replied
john
silence
impressively
that
we
shall
none
of
us
find
the
time
hangs
heavy
i
gather
we
shall
have
our
hands
full
the
two
men
looked
at
one
another
for
the
space
of
some
seconds
and
there
was
an
indefinable
quality
in
their
silence
which
for
the
first
time
made
me
admit
a
swift
question
into
my
mind
and
i
wondered
a
little
at
my
rashness
in
coming
with
so
little
reflection
into
a
big
case
of
this
incalculable
doctor
but
no
answer
suggested
itself
and
to
withdraw
was
of
course
inconceivable
the
gates
had
closed
behind
me
now
and
the
spirit
of
the
adventure
was
already
besieging
my
mind
with
its
advance
guard
of
a
thousand
little
hopes
and
fears
explaining
that
he
would
wait
till
after
dinner
to
discuss
anything
serious
as
no
reference
was
ever
made
before
his
sister
he
led
the
way
upstairs
and
showed
us
personally
to
our
rooms
and
it
was
just
as
i
was
finishing
dressing
that
a
knock
came
at
my
door
and
dr
silence
entered
he
was
always
what
is
called
a
serious
man
so
that
even
in
moments
of
comedy
you
felt
he
never
lost
sight
of
the
profound
gravity
of
life
but
as
he
came
across
the
room
to
me
i
caught
the
expression
of
his
face
and
understood
in
a
flash
that
he
was
now
in
his
most
grave
and
earnest
mood
he
looked
almost
troubled
i
stopped
fumbling
with
my
black
tie
and
stared
it
is
serious
he
said
speaking
in
a
low
voice
more
so
even
than
i
imagined
colonel
wragge's
control
over
his
thoughts
concealed
a
great
deal
in
my
psychometrising
of
the
letter
i
looked
in
to
warn
you
to
keep
yourself
well
in
hand--generally
speaking
haunted
house
i
asked
conscious
of
a
distinct
shiver
down
my
back
but
he
smiled
gravely
at
the
question
haunted
house
of
life
more
likely
he
replied
and
a
look
came
into
his
eyes
which
i
had
only
seen
there
when
a
human
soul
was
in
the
toils
and
he
was
thick
in
the
fight
of
rescue
he
was
stirred
in
the
deeps
colonel
wragge--or
the
sister
i
asked
hurriedly
for
the
gong
was
sounding
neither
directly
he
said
from
the
door
something
far
older
something
very
very
remote
indeed
this
thing
has
to
do
with
the
ages
unless
i
am
mistaken
greatly
the
ages
on
which
the
mists
of
memory
have
long
lain
undisturbed
he
came
across
the
floor
very
quickly
with
a
finger
on
his
lips
looking
at
me
with
a
peculiar
searchingness
of
gaze
are
you
aware
yet
of
anything--odd
here
he
asked
in
a
whisper
anything
you
cannot
quite
define
for
instance
tell
me
hubbard
for
i
want
to
know
all
your
impressions
they
may
help
me
i
shook
my
head
avoiding
his
gaze
for
there
was
something
in
the
eyes
that
scared
me
a
little
but
he
was
so
in
earnest
that
i
set
my
mind
keenly
searching
nothing
yet
i
replied
truthfully
wishing
i
could
confess
to
a
real
emotion
nothing
but
the
strange
heat
of
the
place
he
gave
a
little
jump
forward
in
my
direction
the
heat
again
that's
it
he
exclaimed
as
though
glad
of
my
corroboration
and
how
would
you
describe
it
perhaps
he
asked
quickly
with
a
hand
on
the
door
knob
it
doesn't
seem
like
ordinary
physical
heat
i
said
casting
about
in
my
thoughts
for
a
definition
more
a
mental
heat
he
interrupted
a
glowing
of
thought
and
desire
a
sort
of
feverish
warmth
of
the
spirit
isn't
that
it
i
admitted
that
he
had
exactly
described
my
sensations
good
he
said
as
he
opened
the
door
and
with
an
indescribable
gesture
that
combined
a
warning
to
be
ready
with
a
sign
of
praise
for
my
correct
intuition
he
was
gone
i
hurried
after
him
and
found
the
two
men
waiting
for
me
in
front
of
the
fire
i
ought
to
warn
you
our
host
was
saying
as
i
came
in
that
my
sister
whom
you
will
meet
at
dinner
is
not
aware
of
the
real
object
of
your
visit
she
is
under
the
impression
that
we
are
interested
in
the
same
line
of
study--folklore--and
that
your
researches
have
led
to
my
seeking
acquaintance
she
comes
to
dinner
in
her
chair
you
know
it
will
be
a
great
pleasure
to
her
to
meet
you
both
we
have
few
visitors
so
that
on
entering
the
dining-room
we
were
prepared
to
find
miss
wragge
already
at
her
place
seated
in
a
sort
of
bath-chair
she
was
a
vivacious
and
charming
old
lady
with
smiling
expression
and
bright
eyes
and
she
chatted
all
through
dinner
with
unfailing
spontaneity
she
had
that
face
unlined
and
fresh
that
some
people
carry
through
life
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
her
smooth
plump
cheeks
were
all
pink
and
white
and
her
hair
still
dark
was
divided
into
two
glossy
and
sleek
halves
on
either
side
of
a
careful
parting
she
wore
gold-rimmed
glasses
and
at
her
throat
was
a
large
scarab
of
green
jasper
that
made
a
very
handsome
brooch
her
brother
and
dr
silence
talked
little
so
that
most
of
the
conversation
was
carried
on
between
herself
and
me
and
she
told
me
a
great
deal
about
the
history
of
the
old
house
most
of
which
i
fear
i
listened
to
with
but
half
an
ear
and
when
cromwell
stayed
here
she
babbled
on
he
occupied
the
very
rooms
upstairs
that
used
to
be
mine
but
my
brother
thinks
it
safer
for
me
to
sleep
on
the
ground
floor
now
in
case
of
fire
and
this
sentence
has
stayed
in
my
memory
only
because
of
the
sudden
way
her
brother
interrupted
her
and
instantly
led
the
conversation
on
to
another
topic
the
passing
reference
to
fire
seemed
to
have
disturbed
him
and
thenceforward
he
directed
the
talk
himself
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
this
lively
and
animated
old
lady
sitting
beside
me
and
taking
so
eager
an
interest
in
the
affairs
of
life
was
practically
we
understood
without
the
use
of
her
lower
limbs
and
that
her
whole
existence
for
years
had
been
passed
between
the
sofa
the
bed
and
the
bath-chair
in
which
she
chatted
so
naturally
at
the
dinner
table
she
made
no
allusion
to
her
affliction
until
the
dessert
was
reached
and
then
touching
a
bell
she
made
us
a
witty
little
speech
about
leaving
us
like
time
on
noiseless
feet
and
was
wheeled
out
of
the
room
by
the
butler
and
carried
off
to
her
apartments
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
and
the
rest
of
us
were
not
long
in
following
suit
for
dr
silence
and
myself
were
quite
as
eager
to
learn
the
nature
of
our
errand
as
our
host
was
to
impart
it
to
us
he
led
us
down
a
long
flagged
passage
to
a
room
at
the
very
end
of
the
house
a
room
provided
with
double
doors
and
windows
i
saw
heavily
shuttered
books
lined
the
walls
on
every
side
and
a
large
desk
in
the
bow
window
was
piled
up
with
volumes
some
open
some
shut
some
showing
scraps
of
paper
stuck
between
the
leaves
and
all
smothered
in
a
general
cataract
of
untidy
foolscap
and
loose-half
sheets
my
study
and
workroom
explained
colonel
wragge
with
a
delightful
touch
of
innocent
pride
as
though
he
were
a
very
serious
scholar
he
placed
arm-chairs
for
us
round
the
fire
here
he
added
significantly
we
shall
be
safe
from
interruption
and
can
talk
securely
during
dinner
the
manner
of
the
doctor
had
been
all
that
was
natural
and
spontaneous
though
it
was
impossible
for
me
knowing
him
as
i
did
not
to
be
aware
that
he
was
subconsciously
very
keenly
alert
and
already
receiving
upon
the
ultra-sensitive
surface
of
his
mind
various
and
vivid
impressions
and
there
was
now
something
in
the
gravity
of
his
face
as
well
as
in
the
significant
tone
of
colonel
wragge's
speech
and
something
too
in
the
fact
that
we
three
were
shut
away
in
this
private
chamber
about
to
listen
to
things
probably
strange
and
certainly
mysterious--something
in
all
this
that
touched
my
imagination
sharply
and
sent
an
undeniable
thrill
along
my
nerves
taking
the
chair
indicated
by
my
host
i
lit
my
cigar
and
waited
for
the
opening
of
the
attack
fully
conscious
that
we
were
now
too
far
gone
in
the
adventure
to
admit
of
withdrawal
and
wondering
a
little
anxiously
where
it
was
going
to
lead
what
i
expected
precisely
it
is
hard
to
say
nothing
definite
perhaps
only
the
sudden
change
was
dramatic
a
few
hours
before
the
prosaic
atmosphere
of
piccadilly
was
about
me
and
now
i
was
sitting
in
a
secret
chamber
of
this
remote
old
building
waiting
to
hear
an
account
of
things
that
held
possibly
the
genuine
heart
of
terror
i
thought
of
the
dreary
moors
and
hills
outside
and
the
dark
pine
copses
soughing
in
the
wind
of
night
i
remembered
my
companion's
singular
words
up
in
my
bedroom
before
dinner
and
then
i
turned
and
noted
carefully
the
stern
countenance
of
the
colonel
as
he
faced
us
and
lit
his
big
black
cigar
before
speaking
the
threshold
of
an
adventure
i
reflected
as
i
waited
for
the
first
words
is
always
the
most
thrilling
moment--until
the
climax
comes
but
colonel
wragge
hesitated--mentally--a
long
time
before
he
began
he
talked
briefly
of
our
journey
the
weather
the
country
and
other
comparatively
trivial
topics
while
he
sought
about
in
his
mind
for
an
appropriate
entry
into
the
subject
that
was
uppermost
in
the
thoughts
of
all
of
us
the
fact
was
he
found
it
a
difficult
matter
to
speak
of
at
all
and
it
was
dr
silence
who
finally
showed
him
the
way
over
the
hedge
mr
hubbard
will
take
a
few
notes
when
you
are
ready--you
won't
object
he
suggested
i
can
give
my
undivided
attention
in
this
way
by
all
means
turning
to
reach
some
of
the
loose
sheets
on
the
writing
table
and
glancing
at
me
he
still
hesitated
a
little
i
thought
the
fact
is
he
said
apologetically
i
wondered
if
it
was
quite
fair
to
trouble
you
so
soon
the
daylight
might
suit
you
better
to
hear
what
i
have
to
tell
your
sleep
i
mean
might
be
less
disturbed
perhaps
i
appreciate
your
thoughtfulness
john
silence
replied
with
his
gentle
smile
taking
command
as
it
were
from
that
moment
but
really
we
are
both
quite
immune
there
is
nothing
i
think
that
could
prevent
either
of
us
sleeping
except--an
outbreak
of
fire
or
some
such
very
physical
disturbance
colonel
wragge
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
fixedly
at
him
this
reference
to
an
outbreak
of
fire
i
felt
sure
was
made
with
a
purpose
it
certainly
had
the
desired
effect
of
removing
from
our
host's
manner
the
last
signs
of
hesitancy
forgive
me
he
said
of
course
i
know
nothing
of
your
methods
in
matters
of
this
kind--so
perhaps
you
would
like
me
to
begin
at
once
and
give
you
an
outline
of
the
situation
dr
silence
bowed
his
agreement
i
can
then
take
my
precautions
accordingly
he
added
calmly
the
soldier
looked
up
for
a
moment
as
though
he
did
not
quite
gather
the
meaning
of
these
words
but
he
made
no
further
comment
and
turned
at
once
to
tackle
a
subject
on
which
he
evidently
talked
with
diffidence
and
unwillingness
it's
all
so
utterly
out
of
my
line
of
things
he
began
puffing
out
clouds
of
cigar
smoke
between
his
words
and
there's
so
little
to
tell
with
any
real
evidence
behind
it
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
make
a
consecutive
story
for
you
it's
the
total
cumulative
effect
that
is
so--so
disquieting
he
chose
his
words
with
care
as
though
determined
not
to
travel
one
hair's
breadth
beyond
the
truth
i
came
into
this
place
twenty
years
ago
when
my
elder
brother
died
he
continued
but
could
not
afford
to
live
here
then
my
sister
whom
you
met
at
dinner
kept
house
for
him
till
the
end
and
during
all
these
years
while
i
was
seeing
service
abroad
she
had
an
eye
to
the
place--for
we
never
got
a
satisfactory
tenant--and
saw
that
it
was
not
allowed
to
go
to
ruin
i
myself
took
possession
however
only
a
year
ago
my
brother
he
went
on
after
a
perceptible
pause
spent
much
of
his
time
away
too
he
was
a
great
traveller
and
filled
the
house
with
stuff
he
brought
home
from
all
over
the
world
the
laundry--a
small
detached
building
beyond
the
servants'
quarters--he
turned
into
a
regular
little
museum
the
curios
and
things
i
have
cleared
away--they
collected
dust
and
were
always
getting
broken--but
the
laundry-house
you
shall
see
tomorrow
colonel
wragge
spoke
with
such
deliberation
and
with
so
many
pauses
that
this
beginning
took
him
a
long
time
but
at
this
point
he
came
to
a
full
stop
altogether
evidently
there
was
something
he
wished
to
say
that
cost
him
considerable
effort
at
length
he
looked
up
steadily
into
my
companion's
face
may
i
ask
you--that
is
if
you
won't
think
it
strange
he
said
and
a
sort
of
hush
came
over
his
voice
and
manner
whether
you
have
noticed
anything
at
all
unusual--anything
queer
since
you
came
into
the
house
dr
silence
answered
without
a
moment's
hesitation
i
have
he
said
there
is
a
curious
sensation
of
heat
in
the
place
ah
exclaimed
the
other
with
a
slight
start
you
have
noticed
it
this
unaccountable
heat--
but
its
cause
i
gather
is
not
in
the
house
itself--but
outside
i
was
astonished
to
hear
the
doctor
add
colonel
wragge
rose
from
his
chair
and
turned
to
unhook
a
framed
map
that
hung
upon
the
wall
i
got
the
impression
that
the
movement
was
made
with
the
deliberate
purpose
of
concealing
his
face
your
diagnosis
i
believe
is
amazingly
accurate
he
said
after
a
moment
turning
round
with
the
map
in
his
hands
though
of
course
i
can
have
no
idea
how
you
should
guess--
john
silence
shrugged
his
shoulders
expressively
merely
my
impression
he
said
if
you
pay
attention
to
impressions
and
do
not
allow
them
to
be
confused
by
deductions
of
the
intellect
you
will
often
find
them
surprisingly
uncannily
accurate
colonel
wragge
resumed
his
seat
and
laid
the
map
upon
his
knees
his
face
was
very
thoughtful
as
he
plunged
abruptly
again
into
his
story
on
coming
into
possession
he
said
looking
us
alternately
in
the
face
i
found
a
crop
of
stories
of
the
most
extraordinary
and
impossible
kind
i
had
ever
heard--stories
which
at
first
i
treated
with
amused
indifference
but
later
was
forced
to
regard
seriously
if
only
to
keep
my
servants
these
stories
i
thought
i
traced
to
the
fact
of
my
brother's
death--and
in
a
way
i
think
so
still
he
leant
forward
and
handed
the
map
to
dr
silence
it's
an
old
plan
of
the
estate
he
explained
but
accurate
enough
for
our
purpose
and
i
wish
you
would
note
the
position
of
the
plantations
marked
upon
it
especially
those
near
the
house
that
one
indicating
the
spot
with
his
finger
is
called
the
twelve
acre
plantation
it
was
just
there
on
the
side
nearest
the
house
that
my
brother
and
the
head
keeper
met
their
deaths
he
spoke
as
a
man
forced
to
recognise
facts
that
he
deplored
and
would
have
preferred
to
leave
untouched--things
he
personally
would
rather
have
treated
with
ridicule
if
possible
it
made
his
words
peculiarly
dignified
and
impressive
and
i
listened
with
an
increasing
uneasiness
as
to
the
sort
of
help
the
doctor
would
look
to
me
for
later
it
seemed
as
though
i
were
a
spectator
of
some
drama
of
mystery
in
which
any
moment
i
might
be
summoned
to
play
a
part
it
was
twenty
years
ago
continued
the
colonel
but
there
was
much
talk
about
it
at
the
time
unfortunately
and
you
may
perhaps
have
heard
of
the
affair
stride
the
keeper
was
a
passionate
hot-tempered
man
but
i
regret
to
say
so
was
my
brother
and
quarrels
between
them
seem
to
have
been
frequent
i
do
not
recall
the
affair
said
the
doctor
may
i
ask
what
was
the
cause
of
death
something
in
his
voice
made
me
prick
up
my
ears
for
the
reply
the
keeper
it
was
said
from
suffocation
and
at
the
inquest
the
doctors
averred
that
both
men
had
been
dead
the
same
length
of
time
when
found
and
your
brother
asked
john
silence
noticing
the
omission
and
listening
intently
equally
mysterious
said
our
host
speaking
in
a
low
voice
with
effort
but
there
was
one
distressing
feature
i
think
i
ought
to
mention
for
those
who
saw
the
face--i
did
not
see
it
myself--and
though
stride
carried
a
gun
its
chambers
were
undischarged--
he
stammered
and
hesitated
with
confusion
again
that
sense
of
terror
moved
between
his
words
he
stuck
yes
said
the
chief
listener
sympathetically
my
brother's
face
they
said
looked
as
though
it
had
been
scorched
it
had
been
swept
as
it
were
by
something
that
burned--blasted
it
was
i
am
told
quite
dreadful
the
bodies
were
found
lying
side
by
side
faces
downwards
both
pointing
away
from
the
wood
as
though
they
had
been
in
the
act
of
running
and
not
more
than
a
dozen
yards
from
its
edge
dr
silence
made
no
comment
he
appeared
to
be
studying
the
map
attentively
i
did
not
see
the
face
myself
repeated
the
other
his
manner
somehow
expressing
the
sense
of
awe
he
contrived
to
keep
out
of
his
voice
but
my
sister
unfortunately
did
and
her
present
state
i
believe
to
be
entirely
due
to
the
shock
it
gave
to
her
nerves
she
never
can
be
brought
to
refer
to
it
naturally
and
i
am
even
inclined
to
think
that
the
memory
has
mercifully
been
permitted
to
vanish
from
her
mind
but
she
spoke
of
it
at
the
time
as
a
face
swept
by
flame--blasted
john
silence
looked
up
from
his
contemplation
of
the
map
but
with
the
air
of
one
who
wished
to
listen
not
to
speak
and
presently
colonel
wragge
went
on
with
his
account
he
stood
on
the
mat
his
broad
shoulders
hiding
most
of
the
mantelpiece
they
all
centred
about
this
particular
plantation
these
stories
that
was
to
be
expected
for
the
people
here
are
as
superstitious
as
irish
peasantry
and
though
i
made
one
or
two
examples
among
them
to
stop
the
foolish
talk
it
had
no
effect
and
new
versions
came
to
my
ears
every
week
you
may
imagine
how
little
good
dismissals
did
when
i
tell
you
that
the
servants
dismissed
themselves
it
was
not
the
house
servants
but
the
men
who
worked
on
the
estate
outside
the
keepers
gave
notice
one
after
another
none
of
them
with
any
reason
i
could
accept
the
foresters
refused
to
enter
the
wood
and
the
beaters
to
beat
in
it
word
flew
all
over
the
countryside
that
twelve
acre
plantation
was
a
place
to
be
avoided
day
or
night
there
came
a
point
the
colonel
went
on
now
well
in
his
swing
when
i
felt
compelled
to
make
investigations
on
my
own
account
i
could
not
kill
the
thing
by
ignoring
it
so
i
collected
and
analysed
the
stories
at
first
hand
for
this
twelve
acre
wood
you
will
see
by
the
map
comes
rather
near
home
its
lower
end
if
you
will
look
almost
touches
the
end
of
the
back
lawn
as
i
will
show
you
tomorrow
and
its
dense
growth
of
pines
forms
the
chief
protection
the
house
enjoys
from
the
east
winds
that
blow
up
from
the
sea
and
in
olden
days
before
my
brother
interfered
with
it
and
frightened
all
the
game
away
it
was
one
of
the
best
pheasant
coverts
on
the
whole
estate
and
what
form
if
i
may
ask
did
this
interference
take
asked
dr
silence
in
detail
i
cannot
tell
you
for
i
do
not
know--except
that
i
understand
it
was
the
subject
of
his
frequent
differences
with
the
head
keeper
but
during
the
last
two
years
of
his
life
when
he
gave
up
travelling
and
settled
down
here
he
took
a
special
interest
in
this
wood
and
for
some
unaccountable
reason
began
to
build
a
low
stone
wall
around
it
this
wall
was
never
finished
but
you
shall
see
the
ruins
tomorrow
in
the
daylight
and
the
result
of
your
investigations--these
stories
i
mean
the
doctor
broke
in
anxious
to
keep
him
to
the
main
issues
yes
i'm
coming
to
that
he
said
slowly
but
the
wood
first
for
this
wood
out
of
which
they
grew
like
mushrooms
has
nothing
in
any
way
peculiar
about
it
it
is
very
thickly
grown
and
rises
to
a
clearer
part
in
the
centre
a
sort
of
mound
where
there
is
a
circle
of
large
boulders--old
druid
stones
i'm
told
at
another
place
there's
a
small
pond
there's
nothing
distinctive
about
it
that
i
could
mention--just
an
ordinary
pine-wood
a
very
ordinary
pine-wood--only
the
trees
are
a
bit
twisted
in
the
trunks
some
of
'em
and
very
dense
nothing
more
and
the
stories
well
none
of
them
had
anything
to
do
with
my
poor
brother
or
the
keeper
as
you
might
have
expected
and
they
were
all
odd--such
odd
things
i
mean
to
invent
or
imagine
i
never
could
make
out
how
these
people
got
such
notions
into
their
heads
he
paused
a
moment
to
relight
his
cigar
there's
no
regular
path
through
it
he
resumed
puffing
vigorously
but
the
fields
round
it
are
constantly
used
and
one
of
the
gardeners
whose
cottage
lies
over
that
way
declared
he
often
saw
moving
lights
in
it
at
night
and
luminous
shapes
like
globes
of
fire
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
skimming
and
floating
and
making
a
soft
hissing
sound--most
of
'em
said
that
in
fact--and
another
man
saw
shapes
flitting
in
and
out
among
the
trees
things
that
were
neither
men
nor
animals
and
all
faintly
luminous
no
one
ever
pretended
to
see
human
forms--always
queer
huge
things
they
could
not
properly
describe
sometimes
the
whole
wood
was
lit
up
and
one
fellow--he's
still
here
and
you
shall
see
him--has
a
most
circumstantial
yarn
about
having
seen
great
stars
lying
on
the
ground
round
the
edge
of
the
wood
at
regular
intervals--
what
kind
of
stars
put
in
john
silence
sharply
in
a
sudden
way
that
made
me
start
oh
i
don't
know
quite
ordinary
stars
i
think
he
said
only
very
large
and
apparently
blazing
as
though
the
ground
was
alight
he
was
too
terrified
to
go
close
and
examine
and
he
has
never
seen
them
since
he
stooped
and
stirred
the
fire
into
a
welcome
blaze--welcome
for
its
blaze
of
light
rather
than
for
its
heat
in
the
room
there
was
already
a
strange
pervading
sensation
of
warmth
that
was
oppressive
in
its
effect
and
far
from
comforting
of
course
he
went
on
straightening
up
again
on
the
mat
this
was
all
commonplace
enough--this
seeing
lights
and
figures
at
night
most
of
these
fellows
drink
and
imagination
and
terror
between
them
may
account
for
almost
anything
but
others
saw
things
in
broad
daylight
one
of
the
woodmen
a
sober
respectable
man
took
the
shortcut
home
to
his
midday
meal
and
swore
he
was
followed
the
whole
length
of
the
wood
by
something
that
never
showed
itself
but
dodged
from
tree
to
tree
always
keeping
out
of
sight
yet
solid
enough
to
make
the
branches
sway
and
the
twigs
snap
on
the
ground
and
it
made
a
noise
he
declared--but
really--the
speaker
stopped
and
gave
a
short
laugh--it's
too
absurd--
please
insisted
the
doctor
for
it
is
these
small
details
that
give
me
the
best
clues
always
--it
made
a
crackling
noise
he
said
like
a
bonfire
those
were
his
very
words
like
the
crackling
of
a
bonfire
finished
the
soldier
with
a
repetition
of
his
short
laugh
most
interesting
dr
silence
observed
gravely
please
omit
nothing
yes
he
went
on
and
it
was
soon
after
that
the
fires
began--the
fires
in
the
wood
they
started
mysteriously
burning
in
the
patches
of
coarse
white
grass
that
cover
the
more
open
parts
of
the
plantation
no
one
ever
actually
saw
them
start
but
many
myself
among
the
number
have
seen
them
burning
and
smouldering
they
are
always
small
and
circular
in
shape
and
for
all
the
world
like
a
picnic
fire
the
head
keeper
has
a
dozen
explanations
from
sparks
flying
out
of
the
house
chimneys
to
the
sunlight
focusing
through
a
dewdrop
but
none
of
them
i
must
admit
convince
me
as
being
in
the
least
likely
or
probable
they
are
most
singular
i
consider
most
singular
these
mysterious
fires
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
they
come
only
at
rather
long
intervals
and
never
seem
to
spread
but
the
keeper
had
other
queer
stories
as
well
and
about
things
that
are
verifiable
he
declared
that
no
life
ever
willingly
entered
the
plantation
more
that
no
life
existed
in
it
at
all
no
birds
nested
in
the
trees
or
flew
into
their
shade
he
set
countless
traps
but
never
caught
so
much
as
a
rabbit
or
a
weasel
animals
avoided
it
and
more
than
once
he
had
picked
up
dead
creatures
round
the
edges
that
bore
no
obvious
signs
of
how
they
had
met
their
death
moreover
he
told
me
one
extraordinary
tale
about
his
retriever
chasing
some
invisible
creature
across
the
field
one
day
when
he
was
out
with
his
gun
the
dog
suddenly
pointed
at
something
in
the
field
at
his
feet
and
then
gave
chase
yelping
like
a
mad
thing
it
followed
its
imaginary
quarry
to
the
borders
of
the
wood
and
then
went
in--a
thing
he
had
never
known
it
to
do
before
the
moment
it
crossed
the
edge--it
is
darkish
in
there
even
in
daylight--it
began
fighting
in
the
most
frenzied
and
terrific
fashion
it
made
him
afraid
to
interfere
he
said
and
at
last
when
the
dog
came
out
hanging
its
tail
down
and
panting
he
found
something
like
white
hair
stuck
to
its
jaws
and
brought
it
to
show
me
i
tell
you
these
details
because--
they
are
important
believe
me
the
doctor
stopped
him
and
you
have
it
still
this
hair
he
asked
it
disappeared
in
the
oddest
way
the
colonel
explained
it
was
curious
looking
stuff
something
like
asbestos
and
i
sent
it
to
be
analysed
by
the
local
chemist
but
either
the
man
got
wind
of
its
origin
or
else
he
didn't
like
the
look
of
it
for
some
reason
because
he
returned
it
to
me
and
said
it
was
neither
animal
vegetable
nor
mineral
so
far
as
he
could
make
out
and
he
didn't
wish
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
i
put
it
away
in
paper
but
a
week
later
on
opening
the
package--it
was
gone
oh
the
stories
are
simply
endless
i
could
tell
you
hundreds
all
on
the
same
lines
and
personal
experiences
of
your
own
colonel
wragge
asked
john
silence
earnestly
his
manner
showing
the
greatest
possible
interest
and
sympathy
the
soldier
gave
an
almost
imperceptible
start
he
looked
distinctly
uncomfortable
nothing
i
think
he
said
slowly
nothing--er--i
should
like
to
rely
on
i
mean
nothing
i
have
the
right
to
speak
of
perhaps--yet
his
mouth
closed
with
a
snap
dr
silence
after
waiting
a
little
to
see
if
he
would
add
to
his
reply
did
not
seek
to
press
him
on
the
point
well
he
resumed
presently
and
as
though
he
would
speak
contemptuously
yet
dared
not
this
sort
of
thing
has
gone
on
at
intervals
ever
since
it
spreads
like
wildfire
of
course
mysterious
chatter
of
this
kind
and
people
began
trespassing
all
over
the
estate
coming
to
see
the
wood
and
making
themselves
a
general
nuisance
notices
of
man-traps
and
spring-guns
only
seemed
to
increase
their
persistence
and--think
of
it
he
snorted
some
local
research
society
actually
wrote
and
asked
permission
for
one
of
their
members
to
spend
a
night
in
the
wood
bolder
fools
who
didn't
write
for
leave
came
and
took
away
bits
of
bark
from
the
trees
and
gave
them
to
clairvoyants
who
invented
in
their
turn
a
further
batch
of
tales
there
was
simply
no
end
to
it
all
most
distressing
and
annoying
i
can
well
believe
interposed
the
doctor
then
suddenly
the
phenomena
ceased
as
mysteriously
as
they
had
begun
and
the
interest
flagged
the
tales
stopped
people
got
interested
in
something
else
it
all
seemed
to
die
out
this
was
last
july
i
can
tell
you
exactly
for
i've
kept
a
diary
more
or
less
of
what
happened
ah
but
now
quite
recently
within
the
past
three
weeks
it
has
all
revived
again
with
a
rush--with
a
kind
of
furious
attack
so
to
speak
it
has
really
become
unbearable
you
may
imagine
what
it
means
and
the
general
state
of
affairs
when
i
say
that
the
possibility
of
leaving
has
occurred
to
me
incendiarism
suggested
dr
silence
half
under
his
breath
but
not
so
low
that
colonel
wragge
did
not
hear
him
by
jove
sir
you
take
the
very
words
out
of
my
mouth
exclaimed
the
astonished
man
glancing
from
the
doctor
to
me
and
from
me
to
the
doctor
and
rattling
the
money
in
his
pocket
as
though
some
explanation
of
my
friend's
divining
powers
were
to
be
found
that
way
it's
only
that
you
are
thinking
very
vividly
the
doctor
said
quietly
and
your
thoughts
form
pictures
in
my
mind
before
you
utter
them
it's
merely
a
little
elementary
thought-reading
his
intention
i
saw
was
not
to
perplex
the
good
man
but
to
impress
him
with
his
powers
so
as
to
ensure
obedience
later
good
lord
i
had
no
idea--
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
and
dived
again
abruptly
into
his
narrative
i
did
not
see
anything
myself
i
must
admit
but
the
stories
of
independent
eye-witnesses
were
to
the
effect
that
lines
of
light
like
streams
of
thin
fire
moved
through
the
wood
and
sometimes
were
seen
to
shoot
out
precisely
as
flames
might
shoot
out--in
the
direction
of
this
house
there
he
explained
in
a
louder
voice
that
made
me
jump
pointing
with
a
thick
finger
to
the
map
where
the
westerly
fringe
of
the
plantation
comes
up
to
the
end
of
the
lower
lawn
at
the
back
of
the
house--where
it
links
on
to
those
dark
patches
which
are
laurel
shrubberies
running
right
up
to
the
back
premises--that's
where
these
lights
were
seen
they
passed
from
the
wood
to
the
shrubberies
and
in
this
way
reached
the
house
itself
like
silent
rockets
one
man
described
them
rapid
as
lightning
and
exceedingly
bright
and
this
evidence
you
spoke
of
they
actually
reached
the
sides
of
the
house
they've
left
a
mark
of
scorching
on
the
walls--the
walls
of
the
laundry
building
at
the
other
end
you
shall
see
'em
tomorrow
he
pointed
to
the
map
to
indicate
the
spot
and
then
straightened
himself
and
glared
about
the
room
as
though
he
had
said
something
no
one
could
believe
and
expected
contradiction
scorched--just
as
the
faces
were
the
doctor
murmured
looking
significantly
at
me
scorched--yes
repeated
the
colonel
failing
to
catch
the
rest
of
the
sentence
in
his
excitement
there
was
a
prolonged
silence
in
the
room
in
which
i
heard
the
gurgling
of
the
oil
in
the
lamp
and
the
click
of
the
coals
and
the
heavy
breathing
of
our
host
the
most
unwelcome
sensations
were
creeping
about
my
spine
and
i
wondered
whether
my
companion
would
scorn
me
utterly
if
i
asked
to
sleep
on
the
sofa
in
his
room
it
was
eleven
o'clock
i
saw
by
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
we
had
crossed
the
dividing
line
and
were
now
well
in
the
movement
of
the
adventure
the
fight
between
my
interest
and
my
dread
became
acute
but
even
if
turning
back
had
been
possible
i
think
the
interest
would
have
easily
gained
the
day
i
have
enemies
of
course
i
heard
the
colonel's
rough
voice
break
into
the
pause
presently
and
have
discharged
a
number
of
servants---
it's
not
that
put
in
john
silence
briefly
you
think
not
in
a
sense
i
am
glad
and
yet--there
are
some
things
that
can
be
met
and
dealt
with--
he
left
the
sentence
unfinished
and
looked
down
at
the
floor
with
an
expression
of
grim
severity
that
betrayed
a
momentary
glimpse
of
character
this
fighting
man
loathed
and
abhorred
the
thought
of
an
enemy
he
could
not
see
and
come
to
grips
with
presently
he
moved
over
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
between
us
something
like
a
sigh
escaped
him
dr
silence
said
nothing
my
sister
of
course
is
kept
in
ignorance
as
far
as
possible
of
all
this
he
said
disconnectedly
and
as
if
talking
to
himself
but
even
if
she
knew
she
would
find
matter-of-fact
explanations
i
only
wish
i
could
i'm
sure
they
exist
there
came
then
an
interval
in
the
conversation
that
was
very
significant
it
did
not
seem
a
real
pause
or
the
silence
real
silence
for
both
men
continued
to
think
so
rapidly
and
strongly
that
one
almost
imagined
their
thoughts
clothed
themselves
in
words
in
the
air
of
the
room
i
was
more
than
a
little
keyed
up
with
the
strange
excitement
of
all
i
had
heard
but
what
stimulated
my
nerves
more
than
anything
else
was
the
obvious
fact
that
the
doctor
was
clearly
upon
the
trail
of
discovery
in
his
mind
at
that
moment
i
believe
he
had
already
solved
the
nature
of
this
perplexing
psychical
problem
his
face
was
like
a
mask
and
he
employed
the
absolute
minimum
of
gesture
and
words
all
his
energies
were
directed
inwards
and
by
those
incalculable
methods
and
processes
he
had
mastered
with
such
infinite
patience
and
study
i
felt
sure
he
was
already
in
touch
with
the
forces
behind
these
singular
phenomena
and
laying
his
deep
plans
for
bringing
them
into
the
open
and
then
effectively
dealing
with
them
colonel
wragge
meanwhile
grew
more
and
more
fidgety
from
time
to
time
he
turned
towards
my
companion
as
though
about
to
speak
yet
always
changing
his
mind
at
the
last
moment
once
he
went
over
and
opened
the
door
suddenly
apparently
to
see
if
any
one
were
listening
at
the
keyhole
for
he
disappeared
a
moment
between
the
two
doors
and
i
then
heard
him
open
the
outer
one
he
stood
there
for
some
seconds
and
made
a
noise
as
though
he
were
sniffing
the
air
like
a
dog
then
he
closed
both
doors
cautiously
and
came
back
to
the
fireplace
a
strange
excitement
seemed
growing
upon
him
evidently
he
was
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
to
say
something
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
say
and
john
silence
as
i
rightly
judged
was
waiting
patiently
for
him
to
choose
his
own
opportunity
and
his
own
way
of
saying
it
at
last
he
turned
and
faced
us
squaring
his
great
shoulders
and
stiffening
perceptibly
dr
silence
looked
up
sympathetically
your
own
experiences
help
me
most
he
observed
quietly
the
fact
is
the
colonel
said
speaking
very
low
this
past
week
there
have
been
outbreaks
of
fire
in
the
house
itself
three
separate
outbreaks--and
all--in
my
sister's
room
yes
the
doctor
said
as
if
this
was
just
what
he
had
expected
to
hear
utterly
unaccountable--all
of
them
added
the
other
and
then
sat
down
i
began
to
understand
something
of
the
reason
of
his
excitement
he
was
realising
at
last
that
the
natural
explanation
he
had
held
to
all
along
was
becoming
impossible
and
he
hated
it
it
made
him
angry
fortunately
he
went
on
she
was
out
each
time
and
does
not
know
but
i
have
made
her
sleep
now
in
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
a
wise
precaution
the
doctor
said
simply
he
asked
one
or
two
questions
the
fires
had
started
in
the
curtains--once
by
the
window
and
once
by
the
bed
the
third
time
smoke
had
been
discovered
by
the
maid
coming
from
the
cupboard
and
it
was
found
that
miss
wragge's
clothes
hanging
on
the
hooks
were
smouldering
the
doctor
listened
attentively
but
made
no
comment
and
now
can
you
tell
me
he
said
presently
what
your
own
feeling
about
it
is--your
general
impression
it
sounds
foolish
to
say
so
replied
the
soldier
after
a
moment's
hesitation
but
i
feel
exactly
as
i
have
often
felt
on
active
service
in
my
indian
campaigns
just
as
if
the
house
and
all
in
it
were
in
a
state
of
siege
as
though
a
concealed
enemy
were
encamped
about
us--in
ambush
somewhere
he
uttered
a
soft
nervous
laugh
as
if
the
next
sign
of
smoke
would
precipitate
a
panic--a
dreadful
panic
the
picture
came
before
me
of
the
night
shadowing
the
house
and
the
twisted
pine
trees
he
had
described
crowding
about
it
concealing
some
powerful
enemy
and
glancing
at
the
resolute
face
and
figure
of
the
old
soldier
forced
at
length
to
his
confession
i
understood
something
of
all
he
had
been
through
before
he
sought
the
assistance
of
john
silence
and
tomorrow
unless
i
am
mistaken
is
full
moon
said
the
doctor
suddenly
watching
the
other's
face
for
the
effect
of
his
apparently
careless
words
colonel
wragge
gave
an
uncontrollable
start
and
his
face
for
the
first
time
showed
unmistakable
pallor
what
in
the
world---
he
began
his
lip
quivering
only
that
i
am
beginning
to
see
light
in
this
extraordinary
affair
returned
the
other
calmly
and
if
my
theory
is
correct
each
month
when
the
moon
is
at
the
full
should
witness
an
increase
in
the
activity
of
the
phenomena
i
don't
see
the
connection
colonel
wragge
answered
almost
savagely
but
i
am
bound
to
say
my
diary
bears
you
out
he
wore
the
most
puzzled
expression
i
have
ever
seen
upon
an
honest
face
but
he
abhorred
this
additional
corroboration
of
an
explanation
that
perplexed
him
i
confess
he
repeated
i
cannot
see
the
connection
why
should
you
said
the
doctor
with
his
first
laugh
that
evening
he
got
up
and
hung
the
map
upon
the
wall
again
but
i
do--because
these
things
are
my
special
study--and
let
me
add
that
i
have
yet
to
come
across
a
problem
that
is
not
natural
and
has
not
a
natural
explanation
it's
merely
a
question
of
how
much
one
knows--and
admits
colonel
wragge
eyed
him
with
a
new
and
curious
respect
in
his
face
but
his
feelings
were
soothed
moreover
the
doctor's
laugh
and
change
of
manner
came
as
a
relief
to
all
and
broke
the
spell
of
grave
suspense
that
had
held
us
so
long
we
all
rose
and
stretched
our
limbs
and
took
little
walks
about
the
room
i
am
glad
dr
silence
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
that
you
are
here
he
said
simply
very
glad
indeed
and
now
i
fear
i
have
kept
you
both
up
very
late
with
a
glance
to
include
me
for
you
must
be
tired
and
ready
for
your
beds
i
have
told
you
all
there
is
to
tell
he
added
and
tomorrow
you
must
feel
perfectly
free
to
take
any
steps
you
think
necessary
the
end
was
abrupt
yet
natural
for
there
was
nothing
more
to
say
and
neither
of
these
men
talked
for
mere
talking's
sake
out
in
the
cold
and
chilly
hall
he
lit
our
candles
and
took
us
upstairs
the
house
was
at
rest
and
still
every
one
asleep
we
moved
softly
through
the
windows
on
the
stairs
we
saw
the
moonlight
falling
across
the
lawn
throwing
deep
shadows
the
nearer
pine
trees
were
just
visible
in
the
distance
a
wall
of
impenetrable
blackness
our
host
came
for
a
moment
to
our
rooms
to
see
that
we
had
everything
he
pointed
to
a
coil
of
strong
rope
lying
beside
the
window
fastened
to
the
wall
by
means
of
an
iron
ring
evidently
it
had
been
recently
put
in
i
don't
think
we
shall
need
it
dr
silence
said
with
a
smile
i
trust
not
replied
our
host
gravely
i
sleep
quite
close
to
you
across
the
landing
he
whispered
pointing
to
his
door
and
if
you--if
you
want
anything
in
the
night
you
will
know
where
to
find
me
he
wished
us
pleasant
dreams
and
disappeared
down
the
passage
into
his
room
shading
the
candle
with
his
big
muscular
hand
from
the
draughts
john
silence
stopped
me
a
moment
before
i
went
you
know
what
it
is
i
asked
with
an
excitement
that
even
overcame
my
weariness
yes
he
said
i'm
almost
sure
and
you
not
the
smallest
notion
he
looked
disappointed
but
not
half
as
disappointed
as
i
felt
egypt
he
whispered
egypt
ii
nothing
happened
to
disturb
me
in
the
night--nothing
that
is
except
a
nightmare
in
which
colonel
wragge
chased
me
amid
thin
streaks
of
fire
and
his
sister
always
prevented
my
escape
by
suddenly
rising
up
out
of
the
ground
in
her
chair--dead
the
deep
baying
of
dogs
woke
me
once
just
before
the
dawn
it
must
have
been
for
i
saw
the
window
frame
against
the
sky
there
was
a
flash
of
lightning
too
i
thought
as
i
turned
over
in
bed
and
it
was
warm
for
october
oppressively
warm
it
was
after
eleven
o'clock
when
our
host
suggested
going
out
with
the
guns
these
we
understood
being
a
somewhat
thin
disguise
for
our
true
purpose
personally
i
was
glad
to
be
in
the
open
air
for
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
was
heavy
with
presentiment
the
sense
of
impending
disaster
hung
over
all
fear
stalked
the
passages
and
lurked
in
the
corners
of
every
room
it
was
a
house
haunted
but
really
haunted
not
by
some
vague
shadow
of
the
dead
but
by
a
definite
though
incalculable
influence
that
was
actively
alive
and
dangerous
at
the
least
smell
of
smoke
the
entire
household
quivered
an
odour
of
burning
i
was
convinced
would
paralyse
all
the
inmates
for
the
servants
though
professedly
ignorant
by
the
master's
unspoken
orders
yet
shared
the
common
dread
and
the
hideous
uncertainty
joined
with
this
display
of
so
spiteful
and
calculated
a
spirit
of
malignity
provided
a
kind
of
black
doom
that
draped
not
only
the
walls
but
also
the
minds
of
the
people
living
within
them
only
the
bright
and
cheerful
vision
of
old
miss
wragge
being
pushed
about
the
house
in
her
noiseless
chair
chatting
and
nodding
briskly
to
every
one
she
met
prevented
us
from
giving
way
entirely
to
the
depression
which
governed
the
majority
the
sight
of
her
was
like
a
gleam
of
sunshine
through
the
depths
of
some
ill-omened
wood
and
just
as
we
went
out
i
saw
her
being
wheeled
along
by
her
attendant
into
the
sunshine
of
the
back
lawn
and
caught
her
cheery
smile
as
she
turned
her
head
and
wished
us
good
sport
the
morning
was
october
at
its
best
sunshine
glistened
on
the
dew-drenched
grass
and
on
leaves
turned
golden-red
the
dainty
messengers
of
coming
hoar-frost
were
already
in
the
air
a
search
for
permanent
winter
quarters
from
the
wide
moors
that
everywhere
swept
up
against
the
sky
like
a
purple
sea
splashed
by
the
occasional
grey
of
rocky
clefts
there
stole
down
the
cool
and
perfumed
wind
of
the
west
and
the
keen
taste
of
the
sea
ran
through
all
like
a
master-flavour
borne
over
the
spaces
perhaps
by
the
seagulls
that
cried
and
circled
high
in
the
air
but
our
host
took
little
interest
in
this
sparkling
beauty
and
had
no
thought
of
showing
off
the
scenery
of
his
property
his
mind
was
otherwise
intent
and
for
that
matter
so
were
our
own
those
bleak
moors
and
hills
stretch
unbroken
for
hours
he
said
with
a
sweep
of
the
hand
and
over
there
some
four
miles
pointing
in
another
direction
lies
s----
bay
a
long
swampy
inlet
of
the
sea
haunted
by
myriads
of
seabirds
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
are
the
plantations
and
pine-woods
i
thought
we
would
get
the
dogs
and
go
first
to
the
twelve
acre
wood
i
told
you
about
last
night
it's
quite
near
we
found
the
dogs
in
the
stable
and
i
recalled
the
deep
baying
of
the
night
when
a
fine
bloodhound
and
two
great
danes
leaped
out
to
greet
us
singular
companions
for
guns
i
thought
to
myself
as
we
struck
out
across
the
fields
and
the
great
creatures
bounded
and
ran
beside
us
nose
to
ground
the
conversation
was
scanty
john
silence's
grave
face
did
not
encourage
talk
he
wore
the
expression
i
knew
well--that
look
of
earnest
solicitude
which
meant
that
his
whole
being
was
deeply
absorbed
and
preoccupied
frightened
i
had
never
seen
him
but
anxious
often--it
always
moved
me
to
witness
it--and
he
was
anxious
now
on
the
way
back
you
shall
see
the
laundry
building
colonel
wragge
observed
shortly
for
he
too
found
little
to
say
we
shall
attract
less
attention
then
yet
not
all
the
crisp
beauty
of
the
morning
seemed
able
to
dispel
the
feelings
of
uneasy
dread
that
gathered
increasingly
about
our
minds
as
we
went
in
a
very
few
minutes
a
clump
of
pine
trees
concealed
the
house
from
view
and
we
found
ourselves
on
the
outskirts
of
a
densely
grown
plantation
of
conifers
colonel
wragge
stopped
abruptly
and
producing
a
map
from
his
pocket
explained
once
more
very
briefly
its
position
with
regard
to
the
house
he
showed
how
it
ran
up
almost
to
the
walls
of
the
laundry
building--though
at
the
moment
beyond
our
actual
view--and
pointed
to
the
windows
of
his
sister's
bedroom
where
the
fires
had
been
the
room
now
empty
looked
straight
on
to
the
wood
then
glancing
nervously
about
him
and
calling
the
dogs
to
heel
he
proposed
that
we
should
enter
the
plantation
and
make
as
thorough
examination
of
it
as
we
thought
worth
while
the
dogs
he
added
might
perhaps
be
persuaded
to
accompany
us
a
little
way--and
he
pointed
to
where
they
cowered
at
his
feet--but
he
doubted
it
neither
voice
nor
whip
will
get
them
very
far
i'm
afraid
he
said
i
know
by
experience
if
you
have
no
objection
replied
dr
silence
with
decision
and
speaking
almost
for
the
first
time
we
will
make
our
examination
alone--mr
hubbard
and
myself
it
will
be
best
so
his
tone
was
absolutely
final
and
the
colonel
acquiesced
so
politely
that
even
a
less
intuitive
man
than
myself
must
have
seen
that
he
was
genuinely
relieved
you
doubtless
have
good
reasons
he
said
merely
that
i
wish
to
obtain
my
impressions
uncoloured
this
delicate
clue
i
am
working
on
might
be
so
easily
blurred
by
the
thought-currents
of
another
mind
with
strongly
preconceived
ideas
perfectly
i
understand
rejoined
the
soldier
though
with
an
expression
of
countenance
that
plainly
contradicted
his
words
then
i
will
wait
here
with
the
dogs
and
we'll
have
a
look
at
the
laundry
on
our
way
home
i
turned
once
to
look
back
as
we
clambered
over
the
low
stone
wall
built
by
the
late
owner
and
saw
his
straight
soldierly
figure
standing
in
the
sunlit
field
watching
us
with
a
curiously
intent
look
on
his
face
there
was
something
to
me
incongruous
yet
distinctly
pathetic
in
the
man's
efforts
to
meet
all
far-fetched
explanations
of
the
mystery
with
contempt
and
at
the
same
time
in
his
stolid
unswerving
investigation
of
it
all
he
nodded
at
me
and
made
a
gesture
of
farewell
with
his
hand
that
picture
of
him
standing
in
the
sunshine
with
his
big
dogs
steadily
watching
us
remains
with
me
to
this
day
dr
silence
led
the
way
in
among
the
twisted
trunks
planted
closely
together
in
serried
ranks
and
i
followed
sharp
at
his
heels
the
moment
we
were
out
of
sight
he
turned
and
put
down
his
gun
against
the
roots
of
a
big
tree
and
i
did
likewise
we
shall
hardly
want
these
cumbersome
weapons
of
murder
he
observed
with
a
passing
smile
you
are
sure
of
your
clue
then
i
asked
at
once
bursting
with
curiosity
yet
fearing
to
betray
it
lest
he
should
think
me
unworthy
his
own
methods
were
so
absolutely
simple
and
untheatrical
i
am
sure
of
my
clue
he
answered
gravely
and
i
think
we
have
come
just
in
time
you
shall
know
in
due
course
for
the
present--be
content
to
follow
and
observe
and
think
steadily
the
support
of
your
mind
will
help
me
his
voice
had
that
quiet
mastery
in
it
which
leads
men
to
face
death
with
a
sort
of
happiness
and
pride
i
would
have
followed
him
anywhere
at
that
moment
at
the
same
time
his
words
conveyed
a
sense
of
dread
seriousness
i
caught
the
thrill
of
his
confidence
but
also
in
this
broad
light
of
day
i
felt
the
measure
of
alarm
that
lay
behind
you
still
have
no
strong
impressions
he
asked
nothing
happened
in
the
night
for
instance
no
vivid
dreamings
he
looked
closely
for
my
answer
i
was
aware
i
slept
almost
an
unbroken
sleep
i
was
tremendously
tired
you
know
and
but
for
the
oppressive
heat--
good
you
still
notice
the
heat
then
he
said
to
himself
rather
than
expecting
an
answer
and
the
lightning
he
added
that
lightning
out
of
a
clear
sky--that
flashing--did
you
notice
that
i
answered
truly
that
i
thought
i
had
seen
a
flash
during
a
moment
of
wakefulness
and
he
then
drew
my
attention
to
certain
facts
before
moving
on
you
remember
the
sensation
of
warmth
when
you
put
the
letter
to
your
forehead
in
the
train
the
heat
generally
in
the
house
last
evening
and
as
you
now
mention
in
the
night
you
heard
too
the
colonel's
stories
about
the
appearances
of
fire
in
this
wood
and
in
the
house
itself
and
the
way
his
brother
and
the
gamekeeper
came
to
their
deaths
twenty
years
ago
i
nodded
wondering
what
in
the
world
it
all
meant
and
you
get
no
clue
from
these
facts
he
asked
a
trifle
surprised
i
searched
every
corner
of
my
mind
and
imagination
for
some
inkling
of
his
meaning
but
was
obliged
to
admit
that
i
understood
nothing
so
far
never
mind
you
will
later
and
now
he
added
we
will
go
over
the
wood
and
see
what
we
can
find
his
words
explained
to
me
something
of
his
method
we
were
to
keep
our
minds
alert
and
report
to
each
other
the
least
fancy
that
crossed
the
picture-gallery
of
our
thoughts
then
just
as
we
started
he
turned
again
to
me
with
a
final
warning
and
for
your
safety
he
said
earnestly
imagine
now--and
for
that
matter
imagine
always
until
we
leave
this
place--imagine
with
the
utmost
keenness
that
you
are
surrounded
by
a
shell
that
protects
you
picture
yourself
inside
a
protective
envelope
and
build
it
up
with
the
most
intense
imagination
you
can
evoke
pour
the
whole
force
of
your
thought
and
will
into
it
believe
vividly
all
through
this
adventure
that
such
a
shell
constructed
of
your
thought
will
and
imagination
surrounds
you
completely
and
that
nothing
can
pierce
it
to
attack
he
spoke
with
dramatic
conviction
gazing
hard
at
me
as
though
to
enforce
his
meaning
and
then
moved
forward
and
began
to
pick
his
way
over
the
rough
tussocky
ground
into
the
wood
and
meanwhile
knowing
the
efficacy
of
his
prescription
i
adopted
it
to
the
best
of
my
ability
the
trees
at
once
closed
about
us
like
the
night
their
branches
met
overhead
in
a
continuous
tangle
their
stems
crept
closer
and
closer
the
brambly
undergrowth
thickened
and
multiplied
we
tore
our
trousers
scratched
our
hands
and
our
eyes
filled
with
fine
dust
that
made
it
most
difficult
to
avoid
the
clinging
prickly
network
of
branches
and
creepers
coarse
white
grass
that
caught
our
feet
like
string
grew
here
and
there
in
patches
it
crowned
the
lumps
of
peaty
growth
that
stuck
up
like
human
heads
fantastically
dressed
thrusting
up
at
us
out
of
the
ground
with
crests
of
dead
hair
we
stumbled
and
floundered
among
them
it
was
hard
going
and
i
could
well
conceive
it
impossible
to
find
a
way
at
all
in
the
night-time
we
jumped
when
possible
from
tussock
to
tussock
and
it
seemed
as
though
we
were
springing
among
heads
on
a
battlefield
and
that
this
dead
white
grass
concealed
eyes
that
turned
to
stare
as
we
passed
here
and
there
the
sunlight
shot
in
with
vivid
spots
of
white
light
dazzling
the
sight
but
only
making
the
surrounding
gloom
deeper
by
contrast
and
on
two
occasions
we
passed
dark
circular
places
in
the
grass
where
fires
had
eaten
their
mark
and
left
a
ring
of
ashes
dr
silence
pointed
to
them
but
without
comment
and
without
pausing
and
the
sight
of
them
woke
in
me
a
singular
realisation
of
the
dread
that
lay
so
far
only
just
out
of
sight
in
this
adventure
it
was
exhausting
work
and
heavy
going
we
kept
close
together
the
warmth
too
was
extraordinary
yet
it
did
not
seem
the
warmth
of
the
body
due
to
violent
exertion
but
rather
an
inner
heat
of
the
mind
that
laid
glowing
hands
of
fire
upon
the
heart
and
set
the
brain
in
a
kind
of
steady
blaze
when
my
companion
found
himself
too
far
in
advance
he
waited
for
me
to
come
up
the
place
had
evidently
been
untouched
by
hand
of
man
keeper
forester
or
sportsman
for
many
a
year
and
my
thoughts
as
we
advanced
painfully
were
not
unlike
the
state
of
the
wood
itself--dark
confused
full
of
a
haunting
wonder
and
the
shadow
of
fear
by
this
time
all
signs
of
the
open
field
behind
us
were
hid
no
single
gleam
penetrated
we
might
have
been
groping
in
the
heart
of
some
primeval
forest
then
suddenly
the
brambles
and
tussocks
and
stringlike
grass
came
to
an
end
the
trees
opened
out
and
the
ground
began
to
slope
upwards
towards
a
large
central
mound
we
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
plantation
and
before
us
stood
the
broken
druid
stones
our
host
had
mentioned
we
walked
easily
up
the
little
hill
between
the
sparser
stems
and
resting
upon
one
of
the
ivy-covered
boulders
looked
round
upon
a
comparatively
open
space
as
large
perhaps
as
a
small
london
square
thinking
of
the
ceremonies
and
sacrifices
this
rough
circle
of
prehistoric
monoliths
might
have
witnessed
i
looked
up
into
my
companion's
face
with
an
unspoken
question
but
he
read
my
thought
and
shook
his
head
our
mystery
has
nothing
to
do
with
these
dead
symbols
he
said
but
with
something
perhaps
even
more
ancient
and
of
another
country
altogether
egypt
i
said
half
under
my
breath
hopelessly
puzzled
but
recalling
his
words
in
my
bedroom
he
nodded
mentally
i
still
floundered
but
he
seemed
intensely
preoccupied
and
it
was
no
time
for
asking
questions
so
while
his
words
circled
unintelligibly
in
my
mind
i
looked
round
at
the
scene
before
me
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
recover
breath
and
some
measure
of
composure
but
hardly
had
i
time
to
notice
the
twisted
and
contorted
shapes
of
many
of
the
pine
trees
close
at
hand
when
dr
silence
leaned
over
and
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
he
pointed
down
the
slope
and
the
look
i
saw
in
his
eyes
keyed
up
every
nerve
in
my
body
to
its
utmost
pitch
a
thin
almost
imperceptible
column
of
blue
smoke
was
rising
among
the
trees
some
twenty
yards
away
at
the
foot
of
the
mound
it
curled
up
and
up
and
disappeared
from
sight
among
the
tangled
branches
overhead
it
was
scarcely
thicker
than
the
smoke
from
a
small
brand
of
burning
wood
protect
yourself
imagine
your
shell
strongly
whispered
the
doctor
sharply
and
follow
me
closely
he
rose
at
once
and
moved
swiftly
down
the
slope
towards
the
smoke
and
i
followed
afraid
to
remain
alone
i
heard
the
soft
crunching
of
our
steps
on
the
pine
needles
over
his
shoulder
i
watched
the
thin
blue
spiral
without
once
taking
my
eyes
off
it
i
hardly
know
how
to
describe
the
peculiar
sense
of
vague
horror
inspired
in
me
by
the
sight
of
that
streak
of
smoke
pencilling
its
way
upwards
among
the
dark
trees
and
the
sensation
of
increasing
heat
as
we
approached
was
phenomenal
it
was
like
walking
towards
a
glowing
yet
invisible
fire
as
we
drew
nearer
his
pace
slackened
then
he
stopped
and
pointed
and
i
saw
a
small
circle
of
burnt
grass
upon
the
ground
the
tussocks
were
blackened
and
smouldering
and
from
the
centre
rose
this
line
of
smoke
pale
blue
steady
then
i
noticed
a
movement
of
the
atmosphere
beside
us
as
if
the
warm
air
were
rising
and
the
cooler
air
rushing
in
to
take
its
place
a
little
centre
of
wind
in
the
stillness
overhead
the
boughs
stirred
and
trembled
where
the
smoke
disappeared
otherwise
not
a
tree
sighed
not
a
sound
made
itself
heard
the
wood
was
still
as
a
graveyard
a
horrible
idea
came
to
me
that
the
course
of
nature
was
about
to
change
without
warning
had
changed
a
little
already
that
the
sky
would
drop
or
the
surface
of
the
earth
crash
inwards
like
a
broken
bubble
something
certainly
reached
up
to
the
citadel
of
my
reason
causing
its
throne
to
shake
john
silence
moved
forward
again
i
could
not
see
his
face
but
his
attitude
was
plainly
one
of
resolution
of
muscles
and
mind
ready
for
vigorous
action
we
were
within
ten
feet
of
the
blackened
circle
when
the
smoke
of
a
sudden
ceased
to
rise
and
vanished
the
tail
of
the
column
disappeared
in
the
air
above
and
at
the
same
instant
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
sensation
of
heat
passed
from
my
face
and
the
motion
of
the
wind
was
gone
the
calm
spirit
of
the
fresh
october
day
resumed
command
side
by
side
we
advanced
and
examined
the
place
the
grass
was
smouldering
the
ground
still
hot
the
circle
of
burned
earth
was
a
foot
to
a
foot
and
a
half
in
diameter
it
looked
like
an
ordinary
picnic
fireplace
i
bent
down
cautiously
to
look
but
in
a
second
i
sprang
back
with
an
involuntary
cry
of
alarm
for
as
the
doctor
stamped
on
the
ashes
to
prevent
them
spreading
a
sound
of
hissing
rose
from
the
spot
as
though
he
had
kicked
a
living
creature
this
hissing
was
faintly
audible
in
the
air
it
moved
past
us
away
towards
the
thicker
portion
of
the
wood
in
the
direction
of
our
field
and
in
a
second
dr
silence
had
left
the
fire
and
started
in
pursuit
and
then
began
the
most
extraordinary
hunt
of
invisibility
i
can
ever
conceive
he
went
fast
even
at
the
beginning
and
of
course
it
was
perfectly
obvious
that
he
was
following
something
to
judge
by
the
poise
of
his
head
he
kept
his
eyes
steadily
at
a
certain
level--just
above
the
height
of
a
man--and
the
consequence
was
he
stumbled
a
good
deal
over
the
roughness
of
the
ground
the
hissing
sound
had
stopped
there
was
no
sound
of
any
kind
and
what
he
saw
to
follow
was
utterly
beyond
me
i
only
know
that
in
mortal
dread
of
being
left
behind
and
with
a
biting
curiosity
to
see
whatever
there
was
to
be
seen
i
followed
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
even
then
barely
succeeded
in
keeping
up
with
him
and
as
we
went
the
whole
mad
jumble
of
the
colonel's
stories
ran
through
my
brain
touching
a
sense
of
frightened
laughter
that
was
only
held
in
check
by
the
sight
of
this
earnest
hurrying
figure
before
me
for
john
silence
at
work
inspired
me
with
a
kind
of
awe
he
looked
so
diminutive
among
these
giant
twisted
trees
while
yet
i
knew
that
his
purpose
and
his
knowledge
were
so
great
and
even
in
hurry
he
was
dignified
the
fancy
that
we
were
playing
some
queer
exaggerated
game
together
met
the
fact
that
we
were
two
men
dancing
upon
the
brink
of
some
possible
tragedy
and
the
mingling
of
the
two
emotions
in
my
mind
was
both
grotesque
and
terrifying
he
never
turned
in
his
mad
chase
but
pushed
rapidly
on
while
i
panted
after
him
like
a
figure
in
some
unreasoning
nightmare
and
as
i
ran
it
came
upon
me
that
he
had
been
aware
all
the
time
in
his
quiet
internal
way
of
many
things
that
he
had
kept
for
his
own
secret
consideration
he
had
been
watching
waiting
planning
from
the
very
moment
we
entered
the
shade
of
the
wood
by
some
inner
concentrated
process
of
mind
dynamic
if
not
actually
magical
he
had
been
in
direct
contact
with
the
source
of
the
whole
adventure
the
very
essence
of
the
real
mystery
and
now
the
forces
were
moving
to
a
climax
something
was
about
to
happen
something
important
something
possibly
dreadful
every
nerve
every
sense
every
significant
gesture
of
the
plunging
figure
before
me
proclaimed
the
fact
just
as
surely
as
the
skies
the
winds
and
the
face
of
the
earth
tell
the
birds
the
time
to
migrate
and
warn
the
animals
that
danger
lurks
and
they
must
move
in
a
few
moments
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
mound
and
entered
the
tangled
undergrowth
that
lay
between
us
and
the
sunlight
of
the
field
here
the
difficulties
of
fast
travelling
increased
a
hundredfold
there
were
brambles
to
dodge
low
boughs
to
dive
under
and
countless
tree
trunks
closing
up
to
make
a
direct
path
impossible
yet
dr
silence
never
seemed
to
falter
or
hesitate
he
went
diving
jumping
dodging
ducking
but
ever
in
the
same
main
direction
following
a
clean
trail
twice
i
tripped
and
fell
and
both
times
when
i
picked
myself
up
again
i
saw
him
ahead
of
me
still
forcing
a
way
like
a
dog
after
its
quarry
and
sometimes
like
a
dog
he
stopped
and
pointed--human
pointing
it
was
psychic
pointing
and
each
time
he
stopped
to
point
i
heard
that
faint
high
hissing
in
the
air
beyond
us
the
instinct
of
an
infallible
dowser
possessed
him
and
he
made
no
mistakes
at
length
abruptly
i
caught
up
with
him
and
found
that
we
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
shallow
pond
colonel
wragge
had
mentioned
in
his
account
the
night
before
it
was
long
and
narrow
filled
with
dark
brown
water
in
which
the
trees
were
dimly
reflected
not
a
ripple
stirred
its
surface
watch
he
cried
out
as
i
came
up
it's
going
to
cross
it's
bound
to
betray
itself
the
water
is
its
natural
enemy
and
we
shall
see
the
direction
and
even
as
he
spoke
a
thin
line
like
the
track
of
a
water-spider
shot
swiftly
across
the
shiny
surface
there
was
a
ghost
of
steam
in
the
air
above
and
immediately
i
became
aware
of
an
odour
of
burning
dr
silence
turned
and
shot
a
glance
at
me
that
made
me
think
of
lightning
i
began
to
shake
all
over
quick
he
cried
with
excitement
to
the
trail
again
we
must
run
around
it's
going
to
the
house
the
alarm
in
his
voice
quite
terrified
me
without
a
false
step
i
dashed
round
the
slippery
banks
and
dived
again
at
his
heels
into
the
sea
of
bushes
and
tree
trunks
we
were
now
in
the
thick
of
the
very
dense
belt
that
ran
around
the
outer
edge
of
the
plantation
and
the
field
was
near
yet
so
dark
was
the
tangle
that
it
was
some
time
before
the
first
shafts
of
white
sunlight
became
visible
the
doctor
now
ran
in
zigzags
he
was
following
something
that
dodged
and
doubled
quite
wonderfully
yet
had
begun
i
fancied
to
move
more
slowly
than
before
quick
he
cried
in
the
light
we
shall
lose
it
i
still
saw
nothing
heard
nothing
caught
no
suggestion
of
a
trail
yet
this
man
guided
by
some
interior
divining
that
seemed
infallible
made
no
false
turns
though
how
he
failed
to
crash
headlong
into
the
trees
has
remained
a
mystery
to
me
ever
since
and
then
with
a
sudden
rush
we
found
ourselves
on
the
skirts
of
the
wood
with
the
open
field
lying
in
bright
sunshine
before
our
eyes
too
late
i
heard
him
cry
a
note
of
anguish
in
his
voice
it's
out--and
by
god
it's
making
for
the
house
i
saw
the
colonel
standing
in
the
field
with
his
dogs
where
we
had
left
him
he
was
bending
double
peering
into
the
wood
where
he
heard
us
running
and
he
straightened
up
like
a
bent
whip
released
john
silence
dashed
passed
calling
him
to
follow
we
shall
lose
the
trail
in
the
light
i
heard
him
cry
as
he
ran
but
quick
we
may
yet
get
there
in
time
that
wild
rush
across
the
open
field
with
the
dogs
at
our
heels
leaping
and
barking
and
the
elderly
colonel
behind
us
running
as
though
for
his
life
shall
i
ever
forget
it
though
i
had
only
vague
ideas
of
the
meaning
of
it
all
i
put
my
best
foot
forward
and
being
the
youngest
of
the
three
i
reached
the
house
an
easy
first
i
drew
up
panting
and
turned
to
wait
for
the
others
but
as
i
turned
something
moving
a
little
distance
away
caught
my
eye
and
in
that
moment
i
swear
i
experienced
the
most
overwhelming
and
singular
shock
of
surprise
and
terror
i
have
ever
known
or
can
conceive
as
possible
for
the
front
door
was
open
and
the
waist
of
the
house
being
narrow
i
could
see
through
the
hall
into
the
dining-room
beyond
and
so
out
on
to
the
back
lawn
and
there
i
saw
no
less
a
sight
than
the
figure
of
miss
wragge--running
even
at
that
distance
it
was
plain
that
she
had
seen
me
and
was
coming
fast
towards
me
running
with
the
frantic
gait
of
a
terror-stricken
woman
she
had
recovered
the
use
of
her
legs
her
face
was
a
livid
grey
as
of
death
itself
but
the
general
expression
was
one
of
laughter
for
her
mouth
was
gaping
and
her
eyes
always
bright
shone
with
the
light
of
a
wild
merriment
that
seemed
the
merriment
of
a
child
yet
was
singularly
ghastly
and
that
very
second
as
she
fled
past
me
into
her
brother's
arms
behind
i
smelt
again
most
unmistakably
the
odour
of
burning
and
to
this
day
the
smell
of
smoke
and
fire
can
come
very
near
to
turning
me
sick
with
the
memory
of
what
i
had
seen
fast
on
her
heels
too
came
the
terrified
attendant
more
mistress
of
herself
and
able
to
speak--which
the
old
lady
could
not
do--but
with
a
face
almost
if
not
quite
as
fearful
we
were
down
by
the
bushes
in
the
sun--she
gasped
and
screamed
in
reply
to
colonel
wragge's
distracted
questionings--i
was
wheeling
the
chair
as
usual
when
she
shrieked
and
leaped--i
don't
know
exactly--i
was
too
frightened
to
see--oh
my
god
she
jumped
clean
out
of
the
chair--and
ran
there
was
a
blast
of
hot
air
from
the
wood
and
she
hid
her
face
and
jumped
she
didn't
make
a
sound--she
didn't
cry
out
or
make
a
sound
she
just
ran
but
the
nightmare
horror
of
it
all
reached
the
breaking
point
a
few
minutes
later
and
while
i
was
still
standing
in
the
hall
temporarily
bereft
of
speech
and
movement
for
while
the
doctor
the
colonel
and
the
attendant
were
half-way
up
the
staircase
helping
the
fainting
woman
to
the
privacy
of
her
room
and
all
in
a
confused
group
of
dark
figures
there
sounded
a
voice
behind
me
and
i
turned
to
see
the
butler
his
face
dripping
with
perspiration
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
the
laundry's
on
fire
he
cried
the
laundry
building's
a-caught
i
remember
his
odd
expression
a-caught
and
wanting
to
laugh
but
finding
my
face
rigid
and
inflexible
the
devil's
about
again
s'help
me
gawd
he
cried
in
a
voice
thin
with
terror
running
about
in
circles
and
then
the
group
on
the
stairs
scattered
as
at
the
sound
of
a
shot
and
the
colonel
and
dr
silence
came
down
three
steps
at
a
time
leaving
the
afflicted
miss
wragge
to
the
care
of
her
single
attendant
we
were
out
across
the
front
lawn
in
a
moment
and
round
the
corner
of
the
house
the
colonel
leading
silence
and
i
at
his
heels
and
the
portly
butler
puffing
some
distance
in
the
rear
getting
more
and
more
mixed
in
his
addresses
to
god
and
the
devil
and
the
moment
we
passed
the
stables
and
came
into
view
of
the
laundry
building
we
saw
a
wicked-looking
volume
of
smoke
pouring
out
of
the
narrow
windows
and
the
frightened
women-servants
and
grooms
running
hither
and
thither
calling
aloud
as
they
ran
the
arrival
of
the
master
restored
order
instantly
and
this
retired
soldier
poor
thinker
perhaps
but
capable
man
of
action
had
the
matter
in
hand
from
the
start
he
issued
orders
like
a
martinet
and
almost
before
i
could
realise
it
there
were
streaming
buckets
on
the
scene
and
a
line
of
men
and
women
formed
between
the
building
and
the
stable
pump
inside
i
heard
john
silence
cry
and
the
colonel
followed
him
through
the
door
while
i
was
just
quick
enough
at
their
heels
to
hear
him
add
the
smoke's
the
worst
part
of
it
there's
no
fire
yet
i
think
and
true
enough
there
was
no
fire
the
interior
was
thick
with
smoke
but
it
speedily
cleared
and
not
a
single
bucket
was
used
upon
the
floor
or
walls
the
air
was
stifling
the
heat
fearful
there's
precious
little
to
burn
in
here
it's
all
stone
the
colonel
exclaimed
coughing
but
the
doctor
was
pointing
to
the
wooden
covers
of
the
great
cauldron
in
which
the
clothes
were
washed
and
we
saw
that
these
were
smouldering
and
charred
and
when
we
sprinkled
half
a
bucket
of
water
on
them
the
surrounding
bricks
hissed
and
fizzed
and
sent
up
clouds
of
steam
through
the
open
door
and
windows
this
passed
out
with
the
rest
of
the
smoke
and
we
three
stood
there
on
the
brick
floor
staring
at
the
spot
and
wondering
each
in
our
own
fashion
how
in
the
name
of
natural
law
the
place
could
have
caught
fire
or
smoked
at
all
and
each
was
silent--myself
from
sheer
incapacity
and
befuddlement
the
colonel
from
the
quiet
pluck
that
faces
all
things
yet
speaks
little
and
john
silence
from
the
intense
mental
grappling
with
this
latest
manifestation
of
a
profound
problem
that
called
for
concentration
of
thought
rather
than
for
any
words
there
was
really
nothing
to
say
the
facts
were
indisputable
colonel
wragge
was
the
first
to
utter
my
sister
he
said
briefly
and
moved
off
in
the
yard
i
heard
him
sending
the
frightened
servants
about
their
business
in
an
excellently
matter-of-fact
voice
scolding
some
one
roundly
for
making
such
a
big
fire
and
letting
the
flues
get
over-heated
and
paying
no
heed
to
the
stammering
reply
that
no
fire
had
been
lit
there
for
several
days
then
he
dispatched
a
groom
on
horseback
for
the
local
doctor
then
dr
silence
turned
and
looked
at
me
the
absolute
control
he
possessed
not
only
over
the
outward
expression
of
emotion
by
gesture
change
of
colour
light
in
the
eyes
and
so
forth
but
also
as
i
well
knew
over
its
very
birth
in
his
heart
the
masklike
face
of
the
dead
he
could
assume
at
will
made
it
extremely
difficult
to
know
at
any
given
moment
what
was
at
work
in
his
inner
consciousness
but
now
when
he
turned
and
looked
at
me
there
was
no
sphinx-expression
there
but
rather
the
keen
triumphant
face
of
a
man
who
had
solved
a
dangerous
and
complicated
problem
and
saw
his
way
to
a
clean
victory
now
do
you
guess
he
asked
quietly
as
though
it
were
the
simplest
matter
in
the
world
and
ignorance
were
impossible
i
could
only
stare
stupidly
and
remain
silent
he
glanced
down
at
the
charred
cauldron-lids
and
traced
a
figure
in
the
air
with
his
finger
but
i
was
too
excited
or
too
mortified
or
still
too
dazed
perhaps
to
see
what
it
was
he
outlined
or
what
it
was
he
meant
to
convey
i
could
only
go
on
staring
and
shaking
my
puzzled
head
a
fire-elemental
he
cried
a
fire-elemental
of
the
most
powerful
and
malignant
kind--
a
what
thundered
the
voice
of
colonel
wragge
behind
us
having
returned
suddenly
and
overheard
it's
a
fire-elemental
repeated
dr
silence
more
calmly
but
with
a
note
of
triumph
in
his
voice
he
could
not
keep
out
and
a
fire-elemental
enraged
the
light
began
to
dawn
in
my
mind
at
last
but
the
colonel--who
had
never
heard
the
term
before
and
was
besides
feeling
considerably
worked
up
for
a
plain
man
with
all
this
mystery
he
knew
not
how
to
grapple
with--the
colonel
stood
with
the
most
dumfoundered
look
ever
seen
on
a
human
countenance
and
continued
to
roar
and
stammer
and
stare
and
why
he
began
savage
with
the
desire
to
find
something
visible
he
could
fight--why
in
the
name
of
all
the
blazes--
and
then
stopped
as
john
silence
moved
up
and
took
his
arm
there
my
dear
colonel
wragge
he
said
gently
you
touch
the
heart
of
the
whole
thing
you
ask
'why'
that
is
precisely
our
problem
he
held
the
soldier's
eyes
firmly
with
his
own
and
that
too
i
think
we
shall
soon
know
come
and
let
us
talk
over
a
plan
of
action--that
room
with
the
double
doors
perhaps
the
word
action
calmed
him
a
little
and
he
led
the
way
without
further
speech
back
into
the
house
and
down
the
long
stone
passage
to
the
room
where
we
had
heard
his
stories
on
the
night
of
our
arrival
i
understood
from
the
doctor's
glance
that
my
presence
would
not
make
the
interview
easier
for
our
host
and
i
went
upstairs
to
my
own
room--shaking
but
in
the
solitude
of
my
room
the
vivid
memories
of
the
last
hour
revived
so
mercilessly
that
i
began
to
feel
i
should
never
in
my
whole
life
lose
the
dreadful
picture
of
miss
wragge
running--that
dreadful
human
climax
after
all
the
non-human
mystery
in
the
wood--and
i
was
not
sorry
when
a
servant
knocked
at
my
door
and
said
that
colonel
wragge
would
be
glad
if
i
would
join
them
in
the
little
smoking-room
i
think
it
is
better
you
should
be
present
was
all
colonel
wragge
said
as
i
entered
the
room
i
took
the
chair
with
my
back
to
the
window
there
was
still
an
hour
before
lunch
though
i
imagine
that
the
usual
divisions
of
the
day
hardly
found
a
place
in
the
thoughts
of
any
one
of
us
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
what
i
might
call
electric
the
colonel
was
positively
bristling
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
fingering
an
unlit
black
cigar
his
face
flushed
his
being
obviously
roused
and
ready
for
action
he
hated
this
mystery
it
was
poisonous
to
his
nature
and
he
longed
to
meet
something
face
to
face--something
he
could
gauge
and
fight
dr
silence
i
noticed
at
once
was
sitting
before
the
map
of
the
estate
which
was
spread
upon
a
table
i
knew
by
his
expression
the
state
of
his
mind
he
was
in
the
thick
of
it
all
knew
it
delighted
in
it
and
was
working
at
high
pressure
he
recognised
my
presence
with
a
lifted
eyelid
and
the
flash
of
the
eye
contrasted
with
his
stillness
and
composure
told
me
volumes
i
was
about
to
explain
to
our
host
briefly
what
seems
to
me
afoot
in
all
this
business
he
said
without
looking
up
when
he
asked
that
you
should
join
us
so
that
we
can
all
work
together
and
while
signifying
my
assent
i
caught
myself
wondering
what
quality
it
was
in
the
calm
speech
of
this
undemonstrative
man
that
was
so
full
of
power
so
charged
with
the
strange
virile
personality
behind
it
and
that
seemed
to
inspire
us
with
his
own
confidence
as
by
a
process
of
radiation
mr
hubbard
he
went
on
gravely
turning
to
the
soldier
knows
something
of
my
methods
and
in
more
than
one--er--interesting
situation
has
proved
of
assistance
what
we
want
now--and
here
he
suddenly
got
up
and
took
his
place
on
the
mat
beside
the
colonel
and
looked
hard
at
him--is
men
who
have
self-control
who
are
sure
of
themselves
whose
minds
at
the
critical
moment
will
emit
positive
forces
instead
of
the
wavering
and
uncertain
currents
due
to
negative
feelings--due
for
instance
to
fear
he
looked
at
us
each
in
turn
colonel
wragge
moved
his
feet
farther
apart
and
squared
his
shoulders
and
i
felt
guilty
but
said
nothing
conscious
that
my
latent
store
of
courage
was
being
deliberately
hauled
to
the
front
he
was
winding
me
up
like
a
clock
so
that
in
what
is
yet
to
come
continued
our
leader
each
of
us
will
contribute
his
share
of
power
and
ensure
success
for
my
plan
i'm
not
afraid
of
anything
i
can
see
said
the
colonel
bluntly
i'm
ready
i
heard
myself
say
as
it
were
automatically
for
anything
and
then
added
feeling
the
declaration
was
lamely
insufficient
and
everything
dr
silence
left
the
mat
and
began
walking
to
and
fro
about
the
room
both
hands
plunged
deep
into
the
pockets
of
his
shooting-jacket
tremendous
vitality
streamed
from
him
i
never
took
my
eyes
off
the
small
moving
figure
small
yes--and
yet
somehow
making
me
think
of
a
giant
plotting
the
destruction
of
worlds
and
his
manner
was
gentle
as
always
soothing
almost
and
his
words
uttered
quietly
without
emphasis
or
emotion
most
of
what
he
said
was
addressed
though
not
too
obviously
to
the
colonel
the
violence
of
this
sudden
attack
he
said
softly
pacing
to
and
fro
beneath
the
bookcase
at
the
end
of
the
room
is
due
of
course
partly
to
the
fact
that
tonight
the
moon
is
at
the
full--here
he
glanced
at
me
for
a
moment--and
partly
to
the
fact
that
we
have
all
been
so
deliberately
concentrating
upon
the
matter
our
thinking
our
investigation
has
stirred
it
into
unusual
activity
i
mean
that
the
intelligent
force
behind
these
manifestations
has
realised
that
some
one
is
busied
about
its
destruction
and
it
is
now
on
the
defensive
more
it
is
aggressive
but
'it'--what
is
'it'
began
the
soldier
fuming
what
in
the
name
of
all
that's
dreadful
is
a
fire-elemental
i
cannot
give
you
at
this
moment
replied
dr
silence
turning
to
him
but
undisturbed
by
the
interruption
a
lecture
on
the
nature
and
history
of
magic
but
can
only
say
that
an
elemental
is
the
active
force
behind
the
elements--whether
earth
air
water
or
fire--it
is
impersonal
in
its
essential
nature
but
can
be
focused
personified
ensouled
so
to
say
by
those
who
know
how--by
magicians
if
you
will--for
certain
purposes
of
their
own
much
in
the
same
way
that
steam
and
electricity
can
be
harnessed
by
the
practical
man
of
this
century
alone
these
blind
elemental
energies
can
accomplish
little
but
governed
and
directed
by
the
trained
will
of
a
powerful
manipulator
they
may
become
potent
activities
for
good
or
evil
they
are
the
basis
of
all
magic
and
it
is
the
motive
behind
them
that
constitutes
the
magic
'black'
or
'white'
they
can
be
the
vehicles
of
curses
or
of
blessings
for
a
curse
is
nothing
more
than
the
thought
of
a
violent
will
perpetuated
and
in
such
cases--cases
like
this--the
conscious
directing
will
of
the
mind
that
is
using
the
elemental
stands
always
behind
the
phenomena--
you
think
that
my
brother--
broke
in
the
colonel
aghast
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it--directly
the
fire-elemental
that
has
here
been
tormenting
you
and
your
household
was
sent
upon
its
mission
long
before
you
or
your
family
or
your
ancestors
or
even
the
nation
you
belong
to--unless
i
am
much
mistaken--was
even
in
existence
we
will
come
to
that
a
little
later
after
the
experiment
i
propose
to
make
we
shall
be
more
positive
at
present
i
can
only
say
we
have
to
deal
now
not
only
with
the
phenomenon
of
attacking
fire
merely
but
with
the
vindictive
and
enraged
intelligence
that
is
directing
it
from
behind
the
scenes--vindictive
and
enraged--he
repeated
the
words
that
explains--
began
colonel
wragge
seeking
furiously
for
words
he
could
not
find
quickly
enough
much
said
john
silence
with
a
gesture
to
restrain
him
he
stopped
a
moment
in
the
middle
of
his
walk
and
a
deep
silence
came
down
over
the
little
room
through
the
windows
the
sunlight
seemed
less
bright
the
long
line
of
dark
hills
less
friendly
making
me
think
of
a
vast
wave
towering
to
heaven
and
about
to
break
and
overwhelm
us
something
formidable
had
crept
into
the
world
about
us
for
undoubtedly
there
was
a
disquieting
thought
holding
terror
as
well
as
awe
in
the
picture
his
words
conjured
up
the
conception
of
a
human
will
reaching
its
deathless
hand
spiteful
and
destructive
down
through
the
ages
to
strike
the
living
and
afflict
the
innocent
but
what
is
its
object
burst
out
the
soldier
unable
to
restrain
himself
longer
in
the
silence
why
does
it
come
from
that
plantation
and
why
should
it
attack
us
or
any
one
in
particular
questions
began
to
pour
from
him
in
a
stream
all
in
good
time
the
doctor
answered
quietly
having
let
him
run
on
for
several
minutes
but
i
must
first
discover
positively
what
or
who
it
is
that
directs
this
particular
fire-elemental
and
to
do
that
we
must
first--he
spoke
with
slow
deliberation--seek
to
capture--to
confine
by
visibility--to
limit
its
sphere
in
a
concrete
form
good
heavens
almighty
exclaimed
the
soldier
mixing
his
words
in
his
unfeigned
surprise
quite
so
pursued
the
other
calmly
for
in
so
doing
i
think
we
can
release
it
from
the
purpose
that
binds
it
restore
it
to
its
normal
condition
of
latent
fire
and
also--he
lowered
his
voice
perceptibly
--also
discover
the
face
and
form
of
the
being
that
ensouls
it
the
man
behind
the
gun
cried
the
colonel
beginning
to
understand
something
and
leaning
forward
so
as
not
to
miss
a
single
syllable
i
mean
that
in
the
last
resort
before
it
returns
to
the
womb
of
potential
fire
it
will
probably
assume
the
face
and
figure
of
its
director
of
the
man
of
magical
knowledge
who
originally
bound
it
with
his
incantations
and
sent
it
forth
upon
its
mission
of
centuries
the
soldier
sat
down
and
gasped
openly
in
his
face
breathing
hard
but
it
was
a
very
subdued
voice
that
framed
the
question
and
how
do
you
propose
to
make
it
visible
how
capture
and
confine
it
what
d'ye
mean
dr
john
silence
by
furnishing
it
with
the
materials
for
a
form
by
the
process
of
materialisation
simply
once
limited
by
dimensions
it
will
become
slow
heavy
visible
we
can
then
dissipate
it
invisible
fire
you
see
is
dangerous
and
incalculable
locked
up
in
a
form
we
can
perhaps
manage
it
we
must
betray
it--to
its
death
and
this
material
we
asked
in
the
same
breath
although
i
think
i
had
already
guessed
not
pleasant
but
effective
came
the
quiet
reply
the
exhalations
of
freshly
spilled
blood
not
human
blood
cried
colonel
wragge
starting
up
from
his
chair
with
a
voice
like
an
explosion
i
thought
his
eyes
would
start
from
their
sockets
the
face
of
dr
silence
relaxed
in
spite
of
himself
and
his
spontaneous
little
laugh
brought
a
welcome
though
momentary
relief
the
days
of
human
sacrifice
i
hope
will
never
come
again
he
explained
animal
blood
will
answer
the
purpose
and
we
can
make
the
experiment
as
pleasant
as
possible
only
the
blood
must
be
freshly
spilled
and
strong
with
the
vital
emanations
that
attract
this
peculiar
class
of
elemental
creature
perhaps--perhaps
if
some
pig
on
the
estate
is
ready
for
the
market--
he
turned
to
hide
a
smile
but
the
passing
touch
of
comedy
found
no
echo
in
the
mind
of
our
host
who
did
not
understand
how
to
change
quickly
from
one
emotion
to
another
clearly
he
was
debating
many
things
laboriously
in
his
honest
brain
but
in
the
end
the
earnestness
and
scientific
disinterestedness
of
the
doctor
whose
influence
over
him
was
already
very
great
won
the
day
and
he
presently
looked
up
more
calmly
and
observed
shortly
that
he
thought
perhaps
the
matter
could
be
arranged
there
are
other
and
pleasanter
methods
dr
silence
went
on
to
explain
but
they
require
time
and
preparation
and
things
have
gone
much
too
far
in
my
opinion
to
admit
of
delay
and
the
process
need
cause
you
no
distress
we
sit
round
the
bowl
and
await
results
nothing
more
the
emanations
of
blood--which
as
levi
says
is
the
first
incarnation
of
the
universal
fluid--furnish
the
materials
out
of
which
the
creatures
of
discarnate
life
spirits
if
you
prefer
can
fashion
themselves
a
temporary
appearance
the
process
is
old
and
lies
at
the
root
of
all
blood
sacrifice
it
was
known
to
the
priests
of
baal
and
it
is
known
to
the
modern
ecstasy
dancers
who
cut
themselves
to
produce
objective
phantoms
who
dance
with
them
and
the
least
gifted
clairvoyant
could
tell
you
that
the
forms
to
be
seen
in
the
vicinity
of
slaughter-houses
or
hovering
above
the
deserted
battlefields
are--well
simply
beyond
all
description
i
do
not
mean
he
added
noticing
the
uneasy
fidgeting
of
his
host
that
anything
in
our
laundry-experiment
need
appear
to
terrify
us
for
this
case
seems
a
comparatively
simple
one
and
it
is
only
the
vindictive
character
of
the
intelligence
directing
this
fire-elemental
that
causes
anxiety
and
makes
for
personal
danger
it
is
curious
said
the
colonel
with
a
sudden
rush
of
words
drawing
a
deep
breath
and
as
though
speaking
of
things
distasteful
to
him
that
during
my
years
among
the
hill
tribes
of
northern
india
i
came
across--personally
came
across--instances
of
the
sacrifices
of
blood
to
certain
deities
being
stopped
suddenly
and
all
manner
of
disasters
happening
until
they
were
resumed
fires
broke
out
in
the
huts
and
even
on
the
clothes
of
the
natives--and--and
i
admit
i
have
read
in
the
course
of
my
studies--he
made
a
gesture
toward
his
books
and
heavily
laden
table--of
the
yezidis
of
syria
evoking
phantoms
by
means
of
cutting
their
bodies
with
knives
during
their
whirling
dances--enormous
globes
of
fire
which
turned
into
monstrous
and
terrible
forms--and
i
remember
an
account
somewhere
too
how
the
emaciated
forms
and
pallid
countenances
of
the
spectres
that
appeared
to
the
emperor
julian
claimed
to
be
the
true
immortals
and
told
him
to
renew
the
sacrifices
of
blood
'for
the
fumes
of
which
since
the
establishment
of
christianity
they
had
been
pining'--that
these
were
in
reality
the
phantoms
evoked
by
the
rites
of
blood
both
dr
silence
and
myself
listened
in
amazement
for
this
sudden
speech
was
so
unexpected
and
betrayed
so
much
more
knowledge
than
we
had
either
of
us
suspected
in
the
old
soldier
then
perhaps
you
have
read
too
said
the
doctor
how
the
cosmic
deities
of
savage
races
elemental
in
their
nature
have
been
kept
alive
through
many
ages
by
these
blood
rites
no
he
answered
that
is
new
to
me
in
any
case
dr
silence
added
i
am
glad
you
are
not
wholly
unfamiliar
with
the
subject
for
you
will
now
bring
more
sympathy
and
therefore
more
help
to
our
experiment
for
of
course
in
this
case
we
only
want
the
blood
to
tempt
the
creature
from
its
lair
and
enclose
it
in
a
form--
i
quite
understand
and
i
only
hesitated
just
now
he
went
on
his
words
coming
much
more
slowly
as
though
he
felt
he
had
already
said
too
much
because
i
wished
to
be
quite
sure
it
was
no
mere
curiosity
but
an
actual
sense
of
necessity
that
dictated
this
horrible
experiment
it
is
your
safety
and
that
of
your
household
and
of
your
sister
that
is
at
stake
replied
the
doctor
once
i
have
seen
i
hope
to
discover
whence
this
elemental
comes
and
what
its
real
purpose
is
colonel
wragge
signified
his
assent
with
a
bow
and
the
moon
will
help
us
the
other
said
for
it
will
be
full
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
and
this
kind
of
elemental-being
is
always
most
active
at
the
period
of
full
moon
hence
you
see
the
clue
furnished
by
your
diary
so
it
was
finally
settled
colonel
wragge
would
provide
the
materials
for
the
experiment
and
we
were
to
meet
at
midnight
how
he
would
contrive
at
that
hour--but
that
was
his
business
i
only
know
we
both
realised
that
he
would
keep
his
word
and
whether
a
pig
died
at
midnight
or
at
noon
was
after
all
perhaps
only
a
question
of
the
sleep
and
personal
comfort
of
the
executioner
tonight
then
in
the
laundry
said
dr
silence
finally
to
clinch
the
plan
we
three
alone--and
at
midnight
when
the
household
is
asleep
and
we
shall
be
free
from
disturbance
he
exchanged
significant
glances
with
our
host
who
at
that
moment
was
called
away
by
the
announcement
that
the
family
doctor
had
arrived
and
was
ready
to
see
him
in
his
sister's
room
for
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
john
silence
disappeared
i
had
my
suspicions
that
he
made
a
secret
visit
to
the
plantation
and
also
to
the
laundry
building
but
in
any
case
we
saw
nothing
of
him
and
he
kept
strictly
to
himself
he
was
preparing
for
the
night
i
felt
sure
but
the
nature
of
his
preparations
i
could
only
guess
there
was
movement
in
his
room
i
heard
and
an
odour
like
incense
hung
about
the
door
and
knowing
that
he
regarded
rites
as
the
vehicles
of
energies
my
guesses
were
probably
not
far
wrong
colonel
wragge
too
remained
absent
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
and
deeply
afflicted
had
scarcely
left
his
sister's
bedside
but
in
response
to
my
inquiry
when
we
met
for
a
moment
at
tea-time
he
told
me
that
although
she
had
moments
of
attempted
speech
her
talk
was
quite
incoherent
and
hysterical
and
she
was
still
quite
unable
to
explain
the
nature
of
what
she
had
seen
the
doctor
he
said
feared
she
had
recovered
the
use
of
her
limbs
only
to
lose
that
of
her
memory
and
perhaps
even
of
her
mind
then
the
recovery
of
her
legs
i
trust
may
be
permanent
at
any
rate
i
ventured
finding
it
difficult
to
know
what
sympathy
to
offer
and
he
replied
with
a
curious
short
laugh
oh
yes
about
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
and
it
was
due
merely
to
the
chance
of
my
overhearing
a
fragment
of
conversation--unwillingly
of
course--that
a
little
further
light
was
thrown
upon
the
state
in
which
the
old
lady
actually
lay
for
as
i
came
out
of
my
room
it
happened
that
colonel
wragge
and
the
doctor
were
going
downstairs
together
and
their
words
floated
up
to
my
ears
before
i
could
make
my
presence
known
by
so
much
as
a
cough
then
you
must
find
a
way
the
doctor
was
saying
with
decision
for
i
cannot
insist
too
strongly
upon
that--and
at
all
costs
she
must
be
kept
quiet
these
attempts
to
go
out
must
be
prevented--if
necessary
by
force
this
desire
to
visit
some
wood
or
other
she
keeps
talking
about
is
of
course
hysterical
in
nature
it
cannot
be
permitted
for
a
moment
it
shall
not
be
permitted
i
heard
the
soldier
reply
as
they
reached
the
hall
below
it
has
impressed
her
mind
for
some
reason--
the
doctor
went
on
by
way
evidently
of
soothing
explanation
and
then
the
distance
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
hear
more
at
dinner
dr
silence
was
still
absent
on
the
public
plea
of
a
headache
and
though
food
was
sent
to
his
room
i
am
inclined
to
believe
he
did
not
touch
it
but
spent
the
entire
time
fasting
we
retired
early
desiring
that
the
household
should
do
likewise
and
i
must
confess
that
at
ten
o'clock
when
i
bid
my
host
a
temporary
good-night
and
sought
my
room
to
make
what
mental
preparation
i
could
i
realised
in
no
very
pleasant
fashion
that
it
was
a
singular
and
formidable
assignation
this
midnight
meeting
in
the
laundry
building
and
that
there
were
moments
in
every
adventure
of
life
when
a
wise
man
and
one
who
knew
his
own
limitations
owed
it
to
his
dignity
to
withdraw
discreetly
and
but
for
the
character
of
our
leader
i
probably
should
have
then
and
there
offered
the
best
excuse
i
could
think
of
and
have
allowed
myself
quietly
to
fall
asleep
and
wait
for
an
exciting
story
in
the
morning
of
what
had
happened
but
with
a
man
like
john
silence
such
a
lapse
was
out
of
the
question
and
i
sat
before
my
fire
counting
the
minutes
and
doing
everything
i
could
think
of
to
fortify
my
resolution
and
fasten
my
will
at
the
point
where
i
could
be
reasonably
sure
that
my
self-control
would
hold
against
all
attacks
of
men
devils
or
elementals
iii
at
a
quarter
before
midnight
clad
in
a
heavy
ulster
and
with
slippered
feet
i
crept
cautiously
from
my
room
and
stole
down
the
passage
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
outside
the
doctor's
door
i
waited
a
moment
to
listen
all
was
still
the
house
in
utter
darkness
no
gleam
of
light
beneath
any
door
only
down
the
length
of
the
corridor
from
the
direction
of
the
sick-room
came
faint
sounds
of
laughter
and
incoherent
talk
that
were
not
things
to
reassure
a
mind
already
half
a-tremble
and
i
made
haste
to
reach
the
hall
and
let
myself
out
through
the
front
door
into
the
night
the
air
was
keen
and
frosty
perfumed
with
night
smells
and
exquisitely
fresh
all
the
million
candles
of
the
sky
were
alight
and
a
faint
breeze
rose
and
fell
with
far-away
sighings
in
the
tops
of
the
pine
trees
my
blood
leaped
for
a
moment
in
the
spaciousness
of
the
night
for
the
splendid
stars
brought
courage
but
the
next
instant
as
i
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
moving
stealthily
down
the
gravel
drive
my
spirits
sank
again
ominously
for
yonder
over
the
funereal
plumes
of
the
twelve
acre
plantation
i
saw
the
broken
yellow
disc
of
the
half-moon
just
rising
in
the
east
staring
down
like
some
vast
being
come
to
watch
upon
the
progress
of
our
doom
seen
through
the
distorting
vapours
of
the
earth's
atmosphere
her
face
looked
weirdly
unfamiliar
her
usual
expression
of
benignant
vacancy
somehow
a-twist
i
slipped
along
by
the
shadows
of
the
wall
keeping
my
eyes
upon
the
ground
the
laundry-house
as
already
described
stood
detached
from
the
other
offices
with
laurel
shrubberies
crowding
thickly
behind
it
and
the
kitchen-garden
so
close
on
the
other
side
that
the
strong
smells
of
soil
and
growing
things
came
across
almost
heavily
the
shadows
of
the
haunted
plantation
hugely
lengthened
by
the
rising
moon
behind
them
reached
to
the
very
walls
and
covered
the
stone
tiles
of
the
roof
with
a
dark
pall
so
keenly
were
my
senses
alert
at
this
moment
that
i
believe
i
could
fill
a
chapter
with
the
endless
small
details
of
the
impression
i
received--shadows
odour
shapes
sounds--in
the
space
of
the
few
seconds
i
stood
and
waited
before
the
closed
wooden
door
then
i
became
aware
of
some
one
moving
towards
me
through
the
moonlight
and
the
figure
of
john
silence
without
overcoat
and
bareheaded
came
quickly
and
without
noise
to
join
me
his
eyes
i
saw
at
once
were
wonderfully
bright
and
so
marked
was
the
shining
pallor
of
his
face
that
i
could
hardly
tell
when
he
passed
from
the
moonlight
into
the
shade
he
passed
without
a
word
beckoning
me
to
follow
and
then
pushed
the
door
open
and
went
in
the
chill
air
of
the
place
met
us
like
that
of
an
underground
vault
and
the
brick
floor
and
whitewashed
walls
streaked
with
damp
and
smoke
threw
back
the
cold
in
our
faces
directly
opposite
gaped
the
black
throat
of
the
huge
open
fireplace
the
ashes
of
wood
fires
still
piled
and
scattered
about
the
hearth
and
on
either
side
of
the
projecting
chimney-column
were
the
deep
recesses
holding
the
big
twin
cauldrons
for
boiling
clothes
upon
the
lids
of
these
cauldrons
stood
the
two
little
oil
lamps
shaded
red
which
gave
all
the
light
there
was
and
immediately
in
front
of
the
fireplace
there
was
a
small
circular
table
with
three
chairs
set
about
it
overhead
the
narrow
slit
windows
high
up
the
walls
pointed
to
a
dim
network
of
wooden
rafters
half
lost
among
the
shadows
and
then
came
the
dark
vault
of
the
roof
cheerless
and
unalluring
for
all
the
red
light
it
certainly
was
reminding
me
of
some
unused
conventicle
bare
of
pews
or
pulpit
ugly
and
severe
and
i
was
forcibly
struck
by
the
contrast
between
the
normal
uses
to
which
the
place
was
ordinarily
put
and
the
strange
and
medieval
purpose
which
had
brought
us
under
its
roof
tonight
possibly
an
involuntary
shudder
ran
over
me
for
my
companion
turned
with
a
confident
look
to
reassure
me
and
he
was
so
completely
master
of
himself
that
i
at
once
absorbed
from
his
abundance
and
felt
the
chinks
of
my
failing
courage
beginning
to
close
up
to
meet
his
eye
in
the
presence
of
danger
was
like
finding
a
mental
railing
that
guided
and
supported
thought
along
the
giddy
edges
of
alarm
i
am
quite
ready
i
whispered
turning
to
listen
for
approaching
footsteps
he
nodded
still
keeping
his
eyes
on
mine
our
whispers
sounded
hollow
as
they
echoed
overhead
among
the
rafters
i'm
glad
you
are
here
he
said
not
all
would
have
the
courage
keep
your
thoughts
controlled
and
imagine
the
protective
shell
round
you--round
your
inner
being
i'm
all
right
i
repeated
cursing
my
chattering
teeth
he
took
my
hand
and
shook
it
and
the
contact
seemed
to
shake
into
me
something
of
his
supreme
confidence
the
eyes
and
hands
of
a
strong
man
can
touch
the
soul
i
think
he
guessed
my
thought
for
a
passing
smile
flashed
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
you
will
feel
more
comfortable
he
said
in
a
low
tone
when
the
chain
is
complete
the
colonel
we
can
count
on
of
course
remember
though
he
added
warningly
he
may
perhaps
become
controlled--possessed--when
the
thing
comes
because
he
won't
know
how
to
resist
and
to
explain
the
business
to
such
a
man--
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
expressively
but
it
will
only
be
temporary
and
i
will
see
that
no
harm
comes
to
him
he
glanced
round
at
the
arrangements
with
approval
red
light
he
said
indicating
the
shaded
lamps
has
the
lowest
rate
of
vibration
materialisations
are
dissipated
by
strong
light--won't
form
or
hold
together--in
rapid
vibrations
i
was
not
sure
that
i
approved
altogether
of
this
dim
light
for
in
complete
darkness
there
is
something
protective--the
knowledge
that
one
cannot
be
seen
probably--which
a
half-light
destroys
but
i
remembered
the
warning
to
keep
my
thoughts
steady
and
forbore
to
give
them
expression
there
was
a
step
outside
and
the
figure
of
colonel
wragge
stood
in
the
doorway
though
entering
on
tiptoe
he
made
considerable
noise
and
clatter
for
his
free
movements
were
impeded
by
the
burden
he
carried
and
we
saw
a
large
yellowish
bowl
held
out
at
arms'
length
from
his
body
the
mouth
covered
with
a
white
cloth
his
face
i
noted
was
rigidly
composed
he
too
was
master
of
himself
and
as
i
thought
of
this
old
soldier
moving
through
the
long
series
of
alarms
worn
with
watching
and
wearied
with
assault
unenlightened
yet
undismayed
even
down
to
the
dreadful
shock
of
his
sister's
terror
and
still
showing
the
dogged
pluck
that
persists
in
the
face
of
defeat
i
understood
what
dr
silence
meant
when
he
described
him
as
a
man
to
be
counted
on
i
think
there
was
nothing
beyond
this
rigidity
of
his
stern
features
and
a
certain
greyness
of
the
complexion
to
betray
the
turmoil
of
the
emotions
that
were
doubtless
going
on
within
and
the
quality
of
these
two
men
each
in
his
own
way
so
keyed
me
up
that
by
the
time
the
door
was
shut
and
we
had
exchanged
silent
greetings
all
the
latent
courage
i
possessed
was
well
to
the
fore
and
i
felt
as
sure
of
myself
as
i
knew
i
ever
could
feel
colonel
wragge
set
the
bowl
carefully
in
the
centre
of
the
table
midnight
he
said
shortly
glancing
at
his
watch
and
we
all
three
moved
to
our
chairs
there
in
the
middle
of
that
cold
and
silent
place
we
sat
with
the
vile
bowl
before
us
and
a
thin
hardly
perceptible
steam
rising
through
the
damp
air
from
the
surface
of
the
white
cloth
and
disappearing
upwards
the
moment
it
passed
beyond
the
zone
of
red
light
and
entered
the
deep
shadows
thrown
forward
by
the
projecting
wall
of
chimney
the
doctor
had
indicated
our
respective
places
and
i
found
myself
seated
with
my
back
to
the
door
and
opposite
the
black
hearth
the
colonel
was
on
my
left
and
dr
silence
on
my
right
both
half
facing
me
the
latter
more
in
shadow
than
the
former
we
thus
divided
the
little
table
into
even
sections
and
sitting
back
in
our
chairs
we
awaited
events
in
silence
for
something
like
an
hour
i
do
not
think
there
was
even
the
faintest
sound
within
those
four
walls
and
under
the
canopy
of
that
vaulted
roof
our
slippers
made
no
scratching
on
the
gritty
floor
and
our
breathing
was
suppressed
almost
to
nothing
even
the
rustle
of
our
clothes
as
we
shifted
from
time
to
time
upon
our
seats
was
inaudible
silence
smothered
us
absolutely--the
silence
of
night
of
listening
the
silence
of
a
haunted
expectancy
the
very
gurgling
of
the
lamps
was
too
soft
to
be
heard
and
if
light
itself
had
sound
i
do
not
think
we
should
have
noticed
the
silvery
tread
of
the
moonlight
as
it
entered
the
high
narrow
windows
and
threw
upon
the
floor
the
slender
traces
of
its
pallid
footsteps
colonel
wragge
and
the
doctor
and
myself
too
for
that
matter
sat
thus
like
figures
of
stone
without
speech
and
without
gesture
my
eyes
passed
in
ceaseless
journeys
from
the
bowl
to
their
faces
and
from
their
faces
to
the
bowl
they
might
have
been
masks
however
for
all
the
signs
of
life
they
gave
and
the
light
steaming
from
the
horrid
contents
beneath
the
white
cloth
had
long
ceased
to
be
visible
then
presently
as
the
moon
rose
higher
the
wind
rose
with
it
it
sighed
like
the
lightest
of
passing
wings
over
the
roof
it
crept
most
softly
round
the
walls
it
made
the
brick
floor
like
ice
beneath
our
feet
with
it
i
saw
mentally
the
desolate
moorland
flowing
like
a
sea
about
the
old
house
the
treeless
expanse
of
lonely
hills
the
nearer
copses
sombre
and
mysterious
in
the
night
the
plantation
too
in
particular
i
saw
and
imagined
i
heard
the
mournful
whisperings
that
must
now
be
a-stirring
among
its
tree-tops
as
the
breeze
played
down
between
the
twisted
stems
in
the
depth
of
the
room
behind
us
the
shafts
of
moonlight
met
and
crossed
in
a
growing
network
it
was
after
an
hour
of
this
wearing
and
unbroken
attention
and
i
should
judge
about
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
when
the
baying
of
the
dogs
in
the
stableyard
first
began
and
i
saw
john
silence
move
suddenly
in
his
chair
and
sit
up
in
an
attitude
of
attention
every
force
in
my
being
instantly
leaped
into
the
keenest
vigilance
colonel
wragge
moved
too
though
slowly
and
without
raising
his
eyes
from
the
table
before
him
the
doctor
stretched
his
arm
out
and
took
the
white
cloth
from
the
bowl
it
was
perhaps
imagination
that
persuaded
me
the
red
glare
of
the
lamps
grew
fainter
and
the
air
over
the
table
before
us
thickened
i
had
been
expecting
something
for
so
long
that
the
movement
of
my
companions
and
the
lifting
of
the
cloth
may
easily
have
caused
the
momentary
delusion
that
something
hovered
in
the
air
before
my
face
touching
the
skin
of
my
cheeks
with
a
silken
run
but
it
was
certainly
not
a
delusion
that
the
colonel
looked
up
at
the
same
moment
and
glanced
over
his
shoulder
as
though
his
eyes
followed
the
movements
of
something
to
and
fro
about
the
room
and
that
he
then
buttoned
his
overcoat
more
tightly
about
him
and
his
eyes
sought
my
own
face
first
and
then
the
doctor's
and
it
was
no
delusion
that
his
face
seemed
somehow
to
have
turned
dark
become
spread
as
it
were
with
a
shadowy
blackness
i
saw
his
lips
tighten
and
his
expression
grow
hard
and
stern
and
it
came
to
me
then
with
a
rush
that
of
course
this
man
had
told
us
but
a
part
of
the
experiences
he
had
been
through
in
the
house
and
that
there
was
much
more
he
had
never
been
able
to
bring
himself
to
reveal
at
all
i
felt
sure
of
it
the
way
he
turned
and
stared
about
him
betrayed
a
familiarity
with
other
things
than
those
he
had
described
to
us
it
was
not
merely
a
sight
of
fire
he
looked
for
it
was
a
sight
of
something
alive
intelligent
something
able
to
evade
his
searching
it
was
a
person
it
was
the
watch
for
the
ancient
being
who
sought
to
obsess
him
and
the
way
in
which
dr
silence
answered
his
look--though
it
was
only
by
a
glance
of
subtlest
sympathy--confirmed
my
impression
we
may
be
ready
now
i
heard
him
say
in
a
whisper
and
i
understood
that
his
words
were
intended
as
a
steadying
warning
and
braced
myself
mentally
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
yet
long
before
colonel
wragge
had
turned
to
stare
about
the
room
and
long
before
the
doctor
had
confirmed
my
impression
that
things
were
at
last
beginning
to
stir
i
had
become
aware
in
most
singular
fashion
that
the
place
held
more
than
our
three
selves
with
the
rising
of
the
wind
this
increase
to
our
numbers
had
first
taken
place
the
baying
of
the
hounds
almost
seemed
to
have
signalled
it
i
cannot
say
how
it
may
be
possible
to
realise
that
an
empty
place
has
suddenly
become--not
empty
when
the
new
arrival
is
nothing
that
appeals
to
any
one
of
the
senses
for
this
recognition
of
an
invisible
as
of
the
change
in
the
balance
of
personal
forces
in
a
human
group
is
indefinable
and
beyond
proof
yet
it
is
unmistakable
and
i
knew
perfectly
well
at
what
given
moment
the
atmosphere
within
these
four
walls
became
charged
with
the
presence
of
other
living
beings
besides
ourselves
and
on
reflection
i
am
convinced
that
both
my
companions
knew
it
too
watch
the
light
said
the
doctor
under
his
breath
and
then
i
knew
too
that
it
was
no
fancy
of
my
own
that
had
turned
the
air
darker
and
the
way
he
turned
to
examine
the
face
of
our
host
sent
an
electric
thrill
of
wonder
and
expectancy
shivering
along
every
nerve
in
my
body
yet
it
was
no
kind
of
terror
that
i
experienced
but
rather
a
sort
of
mental
dizziness
and
a
sensation
as
of
being
suspended
in
some
remote
and
dreadful
altitude
where
things
might
happen
indeed
were
about
to
happen
that
had
never
before
happened
within
the
ken
of
man
horror
may
have
formed
an
ingredient
but
it
was
not
chiefly
horror
and
in
no
sense
ghostly
horror
uncommon
thoughts
kept
beating
on
my
brain
like
tiny
hammers
soft
yet
persistent
seeking
admission
their
unbidden
tide
began
to
wash
along
the
far
fringes
of
my
mind
the
currents
of
unwonted
sensations
to
rise
over
the
remote
frontiers
of
my
consciousness
i
was
aware
of
thoughts
and
the
fantasies
of
thoughts
that
i
never
knew
before
existed
portions
of
my
being
stirred
that
had
never
stirred
before
and
things
ancient
and
inexplicable
rose
to
the
surface
and
beckoned
me
to
follow
i
felt
as
though
i
were
about
to
fly
off
at
some
immense
tangent
into
an
outer
space
hitherto
unknown
even
in
dreams
and
so
singular
was
the
result
produced
upon
me
that
i
was
uncommonly
glad
to
anchor
my
mind
as
well
as
my
eyes
upon
the
masterful
personality
of
the
doctor
at
my
side
for
there
i
realised
i
could
draw
always
upon
the
forces
of
sanity
and
safety
with
a
vigorous
effort
of
will
i
returned
to
the
scene
before
me
and
tried
to
focus
my
attention
with
steadier
thoughts
upon
the
table
and
upon
the
silent
figures
seated
round
it
and
then
i
saw
that
certain
changes
had
come
about
in
the
place
where
we
sat
the
patches
of
moonlight
on
the
floor
i
noted
had
become
curiously
shaded
the
faces
of
my
companions
opposite
were
not
so
clearly
visible
as
before
and
the
forehead
and
cheeks
of
colonel
wragge
were
glistening
with
perspiration
i
realised
further
that
an
extraordinary
change
had
come
about
in
the
temperature
of
the
atmosphere
the
increased
warmth
had
a
painful
effect
not
alone
on
colonel
wragge
but
upon
all
of
us
it
was
oppressive
and
unnatural
we
gasped
figuratively
as
well
as
actually
you
are
the
first
to
feel
it
said
dr
silence
in
low
tones
looking
across
at
him
you
are
in
more
intimate
touch
of
course--
the
colonel
was
trembling
and
appeared
to
be
in
considerable
distress
his
knees
shook
so
that
the
shuffling
of
his
slippered
feet
became
audible
he
inclined
his
head
to
show
that
he
had
heard
but
made
no
other
reply
i
think
even
then
he
was
sore
put
to
it
to
keep
himself
in
hand
i
knew
what
he
was
struggling
against
as
dr
silence
had
warned
me
he
was
about
to
be
obsessed
and
was
savagely
though
vainly
resisting
but
meanwhile
a
curious
and
whirling
sense
of
exhilaration
began
to
come
over
me
the
increasing
heat
was
delightful
bringing
a
sensation
of
intense
activity
of
thoughts
pouring
through
the
mind
at
high
speed
of
vivid
pictures
in
the
brain
of
fierce
desires
and
lightning
energies
alive
in
every
part
of
the
body
i
was
conscious
of
no
physical
distress
such
as
the
colonel
felt
but
only
of
a
vague
feeling
that
it
might
all
grow
suddenly
too
intense--that
i
might
be
consumed--that
my
personality
as
well
as
my
body
might
become
resolved
into
the
flame
of
pure
spirit
i
began
to
live
at
a
speed
too
intense
to
last
it
was
as
if
a
thousand
ecstasies
besieged
me--
steady
whispered
the
voice
of
john
silence
in
my
ear
and
i
looked
up
with
a
start
to
see
that
the
colonel
had
risen
from
his
chair
the
doctor
rose
too
i
followed
suit
and
for
the
first
time
saw
down
into
the
bowl
to
my
amazement
and
horror
i
saw
that
the
contents
were
troubled
the
blood
was
astir
with
movement
the
rest
of
the
experiment
was
witnessed
by
us
standing
it
came
too
with
a
curious
suddenness
there
was
no
more
dreaming
for
me
at
any
rate
i
shall
never
forget
the
figure
of
colonel
wragge
standing
there
beside
me
upright
and
unshaken
squarely
planted
on
his
feet
looking
about
him
puzzled
beyond
belief
yet
full
of
a
fighting
anger
framed
by
the
white
walls
the
red
glow
of
the
lamps
upon
his
streaming
cheeks
his
eyes
glowing
against
the
deathly
pallor
of
his
skin
breathing
hard
and
making
convulsive
efforts
of
hands
and
body
to
keep
himself
under
control
his
whole
being
roused
to
the
point
of
savage
fighting
yet
with
nothing
visible
to
get
at
anywhere--he
stood
there
immovable
against
odds
and
the
strange
contrast
of
the
pale
skin
and
the
burning
face
i
had
never
seen
before
or
wish
to
see
again
but
what
has
left
an
even
sharper
impression
on
my
memory
was
the
blackness
that
then
began
crawling
over
his
face
obliterating
the
features
concealing
their
human
outline
and
hiding
him
inch
by
inch
from
view
this
was
my
first
realisation
that
the
process
of
materialisation
was
at
work
his
visage
became
shrouded
i
moved
from
one
side
to
the
other
to
keep
him
in
view
and
it
was
only
then
i
understood
that
properly
speaking
the
blackness
was
not
upon
the
countenance
of
colonel
wragge
but
that
something
had
inserted
itself
between
me
and
him
thus
screening
his
face
with
the
effect
of
a
dark
veil
something
that
apparently
rose
through
the
floor
was
passing
slowly
into
the
air
above
the
table
and
above
the
bowl
the
blood
in
the
bowl
moreover
was
considerably
less
than
before
and
with
this
change
in
the
air
before
us
there
came
at
the
same
time
a
further
change
i
thought
in
the
face
of
the
soldier
one-half
was
turned
towards
the
red
lamps
while
the
other
caught
the
pale
illumination
of
the
moonlight
falling
aslant
from
the
high
windows
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
estimate
this
change
with
accuracy
of
detail
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
while
the
features--eyes
nose
mouth--remained
the
same
the
life
informing
them
had
undergone
some
profound
transformation
the
signature
of
a
new
power
had
crept
into
the
face
and
left
its
traces
there--an
expression
dark
and
in
some
unexplained
way
terrible
then
suddenly
he
opened
his
mouth
and
spoke
and
the
sound
of
this
changed
voice
deep
and
musical
though
it
was
made
me
cold
and
set
my
heart
beating
with
uncomfortable
rapidity
the
being
as
he
had
dreaded
was
already
in
control
of
his
brain
using
his
mouth
i
see
a
blackness
like
the
blackness
of
egypt
before
my
face
said
the
tones
of
this
unknown
voice
that
seemed
half
his
own
and
half
another's
and
out
of
this
darkness
they
come
they
come
i
gave
a
dreadful
start
the
doctor
turned
to
look
at
me
for
an
instant
and
then
turned
to
centre
his
attention
upon
the
figure
of
our
host
and
i
understood
in
some
intuitive
fashion
that
he
was
there
to
watch
over
the
strangest
contest
man
ever
saw--to
watch
over
and
if
necessary
to
protect
he
is
being
controlled--possessed
he
whispered
to
me
through
the
shadows
his
face
wore
a
wonderful
expression
half
triumph
half
admiration
even
as
colonel
wragge
spoke
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
visible
darkness
began
to
increase
pouring
up
thickly
out
of
the
ground
by
the
hearth
rising
up
in
sheets
and
veils
shrouding
our
eyes
and
faces
it
stole
up
from
below--an
awful
blackness
that
seemed
to
drink
in
all
the
radiations
of
light
in
the
building
leaving
nothing
but
the
ghost
of
a
radiance
in
their
place
then
out
of
this
rising
sea
of
shadows
issued
a
pale
and
spectral
light
that
gradually
spread
itself
about
us
and
from
the
heart
of
this
light
i
saw
the
shapes
of
fire
crowd
and
gather
and
these
were
not
human
shapes
or
the
shapes
of
anything
i
recognised
as
alive
in
the
world
but
outlines
of
fire
that
traced
globes
triangles
crosses
and
the
luminous
bodies
of
various
geometrical
figures
they
grew
bright
faded
and
then
grew
bright
again
with
an
effect
almost
of
pulsation
they
passed
swiftly
to
and
fro
through
the
air
rising
and
falling
and
particularly
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
colonel
often
gathering
about
his
head
and
shoulders
and
even
appearing
to
settle
upon
him
like
giant
insects
of
flame
they
were
accompanied
moreover
by
a
faint
sound
of
hissing--the
same
sound
we
had
heard
that
afternoon
in
the
plantation
the
fire-elementals
that
precede
their
master
the
doctor
said
in
an
undertone
be
ready
and
while
this
weird
display
of
the
shapes
of
fire
alternately
flashed
and
faded
and
the
hissing
echoed
faintly
among
the
dim
rafters
overhead
we
heard
the
awful
voice
issue
at
intervals
from
the
lips
of
the
afflicted
soldier
it
was
a
voice
of
power
splendid
in
some
way
i
cannot
describe
and
with
a
certain
sense
of
majesty
in
its
cadences
and
as
i
listened
to
it
with
quickly
beating
heart
i
could
fancy
it
was
some
ancient
voice
of
time
itself
echoing
down
immense
corridors
of
stone
from
the
depths
of
vast
temples
from
the
very
heart
of
mountain
tombs
i
have
seen
my
divine
father
osiris
thundered
the
great
tones
i
have
scattered
the
gloom
of
the
night
i
have
burst
through
the
earth
and
am
one
with
the
starry
deities
something
grand
came
into
the
soldier's
face
he
was
staring
fixedly
before
him
as
though
seeing
nothing
watch
whispered
dr
silence
in
my
ear
and
his
whisper
seemed
to
come
from
very
far
away
again
the
mouth
opened
and
the
awesome
voice
issued
forth
thoth
it
boomed
has
loosened
the
bandages
of
set
which
fettered
my
mouth
i
have
taken
my
place
in
the
great
winds
of
heaven
i
heard
the
little
wind
of
night
with
its
mournful
voice
of
ages
sighing
round
the
walls
and
over
the
roof
listen
came
from
the
doctor
at
my
side
and
the
thunder
of
the
voice
continued--
i
have
hidden
myself
with
you
o
ye
stars
that
never
diminish
i
remember
my
name--in--the--house--of--fire
the
voice
ceased
and
the
sound
died
away
something
about
the
face
and
figure
of
colonel
wragge
relaxed
i
thought
the
terrible
look
passed
from
his
face
the
being
that
obsessed
him
was
gone
the
great
ritual
said
dr
silence
aside
to
me
very
low
the
book
of
the
dead
now
it's
leaving
him
soon
the
blood
will
fashion
it
a
body
colonel
wragge
who
had
stood
absolutely
motionless
all
this
time
suddenly
swayed
so
that
i
thought
he
was
going
to
fall--and
but
for
the
quick
support
of
the
doctor's
arm
he
probably
would
have
fallen
for
he
staggered
as
in
the
beginning
of
collapse
i
am
drunk
with
the
wine
of
osiris
he
cried--and
it
was
half
with
his
own
voice
this
time--but
horus
the
eternal
watcher
is
about
my
path--for--safety
the
voice
dwindled
and
failed
dying
away
into
something
almost
like
a
cry
of
distress
now
watch
closely
said
dr
silence
speaking
loud
for
after
the
cry
will
come
the
fire
i
began
to
tremble
involuntarily
an
awful
change
had
come
without
warning
into
the
air
my
legs
grew
weak
as
paper
beneath
my
weight
and
i
had
to
support
myself
by
leaning
on
the
table
colonel
wragge
i
saw
was
also
leaning
forward
with
a
kind
of
droop
the
shapes
of
fire
had
vanished
all
but
his
face
was
lit
by
the
red
lamps
and
the
pale
shifting
moonlight
rose
behind
him
like
mist
we
were
both
gazing
at
the
bowl
now
almost
empty
the
colonel
stooped
so
low
i
feared
every
minute
he
would
lose
his
balance
and
drop
into
it
and
the
shadow
that
had
so
long
been
in
process
of
forming
now
at
length
began
to
assume
material
outline
in
the
air
before
us
then
john
silence
moved
forward
quickly
he
took
his
place
between
us
and
the
shadow
erect
formidable
absolute
master
of
the
situation
i
saw
him
stand
there
his
face
calm
and
almost
smiling
and
fire
in
his
eyes
his
protective
influence
was
astounding
and
incalculable
even
the
abhorrent
dread
i
felt
at
the
sight
of
the
creature
growing
into
life
and
substance
before
us
lessened
in
some
way
so
that
i
was
able
to
keep
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
air
above
the
bowl
without
too
vivid
a
terror
but
as
it
took
shape
rising
out
of
nothing
as
it
were
and
growing
momentarily
more
defined
in
outline
a
period
of
utter
and
wonderful
silence
settled
down
upon
the
building
and
all
it
contained
a
hush
of
ages
like
the
sudden
centre
of
peace
at
the
heart
of
the
travelling
cyclone
descended
through
the
night
and
out
of
this
hush
as
out
of
the
emanations
of
the
steaming
blood
issued
the
form
of
the
ancient
being
who
had
first
sent
the
elemental
of
fire
upon
its
mission
it
grew
and
darkened
and
solidified
before
our
eyes
it
rose
from
just
beyond
the
table
so
that
the
lower
portions
remained
invisible
but
i
saw
the
outline
limn
itself
upon
the
air
as
though
slowly
revealed
by
the
rising
of
a
curtain
it
apparently
had
not
then
quite
concentrated
to
the
normal
proportions
but
was
spread
out
on
all
sides
into
space
huge
though
rapidly
condensing
for
i
saw
the
colossal
shoulders
the
neck
the
lower
portion
of
the
dark
jaws
the
terrible
mouth
and
then
the
teeth
and
lips--and
as
the
veil
seemed
to
lift
further
upon
the
tremendous
face--i
saw
the
nose
and
cheek
bones
in
another
moment
i
should
have
looked
straight
into
the
eyes--
but
what
dr
silence
did
at
that
moment
was
so
unexpected
and
took
me
so
by
surprise
that
i
have
never
yet
properly
understood
its
nature
and
he
has
never
yet
seen
fit
to
explain
in
detail
to
me
he
uttered
some
sound
that
had
a
note
of
command
in
it--and
in
so
doing
stepped
forward
and
intervened
between
me
and
the
face
the
figure
just
nearing
completeness
he
therefore
hid
from
my
sight--and
i
have
always
thought
purposely
hid
from
my
sight
the
fire
he
cried
out
the
fire
beware
there
was
a
sudden
roar
as
of
flame
from
the
very
mouth
of
the
pit
and
for
the
space
of
a
single
second
all
grew
light
as
day
a
blinding
flash
passed
across
my
face
and
there
was
heat
for
an
instant
that
seemed
to
shrivel
skin
and
flesh
and
bone
then
came
steps
and
i
heard
colonel
wragge
utter
a
great
cry
wilder
than
any
human
cry
i
have
ever
known
the
heat
sucked
all
the
breath
out
of
my
lungs
with
a
rush
and
the
blaze
of
light
as
it
vanished
swept
my
vision
with
it
into
enveloping
darkness
when
i
recovered
the
use
of
my
senses
a
few
moments
later
i
saw
that
colonel
wragge
with
a
face
of
death
its
whiteness
strangely
stained
had
moved
closer
to
me
dr
silence
stood
beside
him
an
expression
of
triumph
and
success
in
his
eyes
the
next
minute
the
soldier
tried
to
clutch
me
with
his
hand
then
he
reeled
staggered
and
unable
to
save
himself
fell
with
a
great
crash
upon
the
brick
floor
after
the
sheet
of
flame
a
wind
raged
round
the
building
as
though
it
would
lift
the
roof
off
but
then
passed
as
suddenly
as
it
came
and
in
the
intense
calm
that
followed
i
saw
that
the
form
had
vanished
and
the
doctor
was
stooping
over
colonel
wragge
upon
the
floor
trying
to
lift
him
to
a
sitting
position
light
he
said
quietly
more
light
take
the
shades
off
colonel
wragge
sat
up
and
the
glare
of
the
unshaded
lamps
fell
upon
his
face
it
was
grey
and
drawn
still
running
heat
and
there
was
a
look
in
the
eyes
and
about
the
corners
of
the
mouth
that
seemed
in
this
short
space
of
time
to
have
added
years
to
its
age
at
the
same
time
the
expression
of
effort
and
anxiety
had
left
it
it
showed
relief
gone
he
said
looking
up
at
the
doctor
in
a
dazed
fashion
and
struggling
to
his
feet
thank
god
it's
gone
at
last
he
stared
round
the
laundry
as
though
to
find
out
where
he
was
did
it
control
me--take
possession
of
me
did
i
talk
nonsense
he
asked
bluntly
after
the
heat
came
i
remember
nothing--
you'll
feel
yourself
again
in
a
few
minutes
the
doctor
said
to
my
infinite
horror
i
saw
that
he
was
surreptitiously
wiping
sundry
dark
stains
from
the
face
our
experiment
has
been
a
success
and--
he
gave
me
a
swift
glance
to
hide
the
bowl
standing
between
me
and
our
host
while
i
hurriedly
stuffed
it
down
under
the
lid
of
the
nearest
cauldron
--and
none
of
us
the
worse
for
it
he
finished
and
fires
he
asked
still
dazed
there'll
be
no
more
fires
it
is
dissipated--partly
at
any
rate
replied
dr
silence
cautiously
and
the
man
behind
the
gun
he
went
on
only
half
realising
what
he
was
saying
i
think
have
you
discovered
that
a
form
materialised
said
the
doctor
briefly
i
know
for
certain
now
what
the
directing
intelligence
was
behind
it
all
colonel
wragge
pulled
himself
together
and
got
upon
his
feet
the
words
conveyed
no
clear
meaning
to
him
yet
but
his
memory
was
returning
gradually
and
he
was
trying
to
piece
together
the
fragments
into
a
connected
whole
he
shivered
a
little
for
the
place
had
grown
suddenly
chilly
the
air
was
empty
again
lifeless
you
feel
all
right
again
now
dr
silence
said
in
the
tone
of
a
man
stating
a
fact
rather
than
asking
a
question
thanks
to
you--both
yes
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
mopped
his
face
and
even
attempted
a
smile
he
made
me
think
of
a
man
coming
from
the
battlefield
with
the
stains
of
fighting
still
upon
him
but
scornful
of
his
wounds
then
he
turned
gravely
towards
the
doctor
with
a
question
in
his
eyes
memory
had
returned
and
he
was
himself
again
precisely
what
i
expected
the
doctor
said
calmly
a
fire-elemental
sent
upon
its
mission
in
the
days
of
thebes
centuries
before
christ
and
tonight
for
the
first
time
all
these
thousands
of
years
released
from
the
spell
that
originally
bound
it
we
stared
at
him
in
amazement
colonel
wragge
opening
his
lips
for
words
that
refused
to
shape
themselves
and
if
we
dig
he
continued
significantly
pointing
to
the
floor
where
the
blackness
had
poured
up
we
shall
find
some
underground
connection--a
tunnel
most
likely--leading
to
the
twelve
acre
wood
it
was
made
by--your
predecessor
a
tunnel
made
by
my
brother
gasped
the
soldier
then
my
sister
should
know--she
lived
here
with
him--
he
stopped
suddenly
john
silence
inclined
his
head
slowly
i
think
so
he
said
quietly
your
brother
no
doubt
was
as
much
tormented
as
you
have
been
he
continued
after
a
pause
in
which
colonel
wragge
seemed
deeply
preoccupied
with
his
thoughts
and
tried
to
find
peace
by
burying
it
in
the
wood
and
surrounding
the
wood
then
like
a
large
magic
circle
with
the
enchantments
of
the
old
formulae
so
the
stars
the
man
saw
blazing--
but
burying
what
asked
the
soldier
faintly
stepping
backwards
towards
the
support
of
the
wall
dr
silence
regarded
us
both
intently
for
a
moment
before
he
replied
i
think
he
weighed
in
his
mind
whether
to
tell
us
now
or
when
the
investigation
was
absolutely
complete
the
mummy
he
said
softly
after
a
moment
the
mummy
that
your
brother
took
from
its
resting
place
of
centuries
and
brought
home--here
colonel
wragge
dropped
down
upon
the
nearest
chair
hanging
breathlessly
on
every
word
he
was
far
too
amazed
for
speech
the
mummy
of
some
important
person--a
priest
most
likely--protected
from
disturbance
and
desecration
by
the
ceremonial
magic
of
the
time
for
they
understood
how
to
attach
to
the
mummy
to
lock
up
with
it
in
the
tomb
an
elemental
force
that
would
direct
itself
even
after
ages
upon
any
one
who
dared
to
molest
it
in
this
case
it
was
an
elemental
of
fire
dr
silence
crossed
the
floor
and
turned
out
the
lamps
one
by
one
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
for
the
moment
following
his
example
i
folded
the
table
together
and
took
up
the
chairs
and
our
host
still
dazed
and
silent
mechanically
obeyed
him
and
moved
to
the
door
we
removed
all
traces
of
the
experiment
taking
the
empty
bowl
back
to
the
house
concealed
beneath
an
ulster
the
air
was
cool
and
fragrant
as
we
walked
to
the
house
the
stars
beginning
to
fade
overhead
and
a
fresh
wind
of
early
morning
blowing
up
out
of
the
east
where
the
sky
was
already
hinting
of
the
coming
day
it
was
after
five
o'clock
stealthily
we
entered
the
front
hall
and
locked
the
door
and
as
we
went
on
tiptoe
upstairs
to
our
rooms
the
colonel
peering
at
us
over
his
candle
as
he
nodded
good-night
whispered
that
if
we
were
ready
the
digging
should
be
begun
that
very
day
then
i
saw
him
steal
along
to
his
sister's
room
and
disappear
iv
but
not
even
the
mysterious
references
to
the
mummy
or
the
prospect
of
a
revelation
by
digging
were
able
to
hinder
the
reaction
that
followed
the
intense
excitement
of
the
past
twelve
hours
and
i
slept
the
sleep
of
the
dead
dreamless
and
undisturbed
a
touch
on
the
shoulder
woke
me
and
i
saw
dr
silence
standing
beside
the
bed
dressed
to
go
out
come
he
said
it's
tea-time
you've
slept
the
best
part
of
a
dozen
hours
i
sprang
up
and
made
a
hurried
toilet
while
my
companion
sat
and
talked
he
looked
fresh
and
rested
and
his
manner
was
even
quieter
than
usual
colonel
wragge
has
provided
spades
and
pickaxes
we're
going
out
to
unearth
this
mummy
at
once
he
said
and
there's
no
reason
we
should
not
get
away
by
the
morning
train
i'm
ready
to
go
tonight
if
you
are
i
said
honestly
but
dr
silence
shook
his
head
i
must
see
this
through
to
the
end
he
said
gravely
and
in
a
tone
that
made
me
think
he
still
anticipated
serious
things
perhaps
he
went
on
talking
while
i
dressed
this
case
is
really
typical
of
all
stories
of
mummy-haunting
and
none
of
them
are
cases
to
trifle
with
he
explained
for
the
mummies
of
important
people--kings
priests
magicians--were
laid
away
with
profoundly
significant
ceremonial
and
were
very
effectively
protected
as
you
have
seen
against
desecration
and
especially
against
destruction
the
general
belief
he
went
on
anticipating
my
questions
held
of
course
that
the
perpetuity
of
the
mummy
guaranteed
that
of
its
ka--the
owner's
spirit--but
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
magical
embalming
was
also
used
to
retard
reincarnation
the
preservation
of
the
body
preventing
the
return
of
the
spirit
to
the
toil
and
discipline
of
earth-life
and
in
any
case
they
knew
how
to
attach
powerful
guardian-forces
to
keep
off
trespassers
and
any
one
who
dared
to
remove
the
mummy
or
especially
to
unwind
it--well
he
added
with
meaning
you
have
seen--and
you
will
see
i
caught
his
face
in
the
mirror
while
i
struggled
with
my
collar
it
was
deeply
serious
there
could
be
no
question
that
he
spoke
of
what
he
believed
and
knew
the
traveller-brother
who
brought
it
here
must
have
been
haunted
too
he
continued
for
he
tried
to
banish
it
by
burial
in
the
wood
making
a
magic
circle
to
enclose
it
something
of
genuine
ceremonial
he
must
have
known
for
the
stars
the
man
saw
were
of
course
the
remains
of
the
still
flaming
pentagrams
he
traced
at
intervals
in
the
circle
only
he
did
not
know
enough
or
possibly
was
ignorant
that
the
mummy's
guardian
was
a
fire-force
fire
cannot
be
enclosed
by
fire
though
as
you
saw
it
can
be
released
by
it
then
that
awful
figure
in
the
laundry
i
asked
thrilled
to
find
him
so
communicative
undoubtedly
the
actual
ka
of
the
mummy
operating
always
behind
its
agent
the
elemental
and
most
likely
thousands
of
years
old
and
miss
wragge--
i
ventured
once
more
ah
miss
wragge
he
repeated
with
increased
gravity
miss
wragge--
a
knock
at
the
door
brought
a
servant
with
word
that
tea
was
ready
and
the
colonel
had
sent
to
ask
if
we
were
coming
down
the
thread
was
broken
dr
silence
moved
to
the
door
and
signed
to
me
to
follow
but
his
manner
told
me
that
in
any
case
no
real
answer
would
have
been
forthcoming
to
my
question
and
the
place
to
dig
in
i
asked
unable
to
restrain
my
curiosity
will
you
find
it
by
some
process
of
divination
or--
he
paused
at
the
door
and
looked
back
at
me
and
with
that
he
left
me
to
finish
my
dressing
it
was
growing
dark
when
the
three
of
us
silently
made
our
way
to
the
twelve
acre
plantation
the
sky
was
overcast
and
a
black
wind
came
out
of
the
east
gloom
hung
about
the
old
house
and
the
air
seemed
full
of
sighings
we
found
the
tools
ready
laid
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
each
shouldering
his
piece
we
followed
our
leader
at
once
in
among
the
trees
he
went
straight
forward
for
some
twenty
yards
and
then
stopped
at
his
feet
lay
the
blackened
circle
of
one
of
the
burned
places
it
was
just
discernible
against
the
surrounding
white
grass
there
are
three
of
these
he
said
and
they
all
lie
in
a
line
with
one
another
any
one
of
them
will
tap
the
tunnel
that
connects
the
laundry--the
former
museum--with
the
chamber
where
the
mummy
now
lies
buried
he
at
once
cleared
away
the
burnt
grass
and
began
to
dig
we
all
began
to
dig
while
i
used
the
pick
the
others
shovelled
vigorously
no
one
spoke
colonel
wragge
worked
the
hardest
of
the
three
the
soil
was
light
and
sandy
and
there
were
only
a
few
snake-like
roots
and
occasional
loose
stones
to
delay
us
the
pick
made
short
work
of
these
and
meanwhile
the
darkness
settled
about
us
and
the
biting
wind
swept
roaring
through
the
trees
overhead
then
quite
suddenly
without
a
cry
colonel
wragge
disappeared
up
to
his
neck
the
tunnel
cried
the
doctor
helping
to
drag
him
out
red
breathless
and
covered
with
sand
and
perspiration
now
let
me
lead
the
way
and
he
slipped
down
nimbly
into
the
hole
so
that
a
moment
later
we
heard
his
voice
muffled
by
sand
and
distance
rising
up
to
us
hubbard
you
come
next
and
then
colonel
wragge--if
he
wishes
we
heard
i'll
follow
you
of
course
he
said
looking
at
me
as
i
scrambled
in
the
hole
was
bigger
now
and
i
got
down
on
all-fours
in
a
channel
not
much
bigger
than
a
large
sewer-pipe
and
found
myself
in
total
darkness
a
minute
later
a
heavy
thud
followed
by
a
cataract
of
loose
sand
announced
the
arrival
of
the
colonel
catch
hold
of
my
heel
called
dr
silence
and
colonel
wragge
can
take
yours
in
this
slow
laborious
fashion
we
wormed
our
way
along
a
tunnel
that
had
been
roughly
dug
out
of
the
shifting
sand
and
was
shored
up
clumsily
by
means
of
wooden
pillars
and
posts
any
moment
it
seemed
to
me
we
might
be
buried
alive
we
could
not
see
an
inch
before
our
eyes
but
had
to
grope
our
way
feeling
the
pillars
and
the
walls
it
was
difficult
to
breathe
and
the
colonel
behind
me
made
but
slow
progress
for
the
cramped
position
of
our
bodies
was
very
severe
we
had
travelled
in
this
way
for
ten
minutes
and
gone
perhaps
as
much
as
ten
yards
when
i
lost
my
grasp
of
the
doctor's
heel
ah
i
heard
his
voice
sounding
above
me
somewhere
he
was
standing
up
in
a
clear
space
and
the
next
moment
i
was
standing
beside
him
colonel
wragge
came
heavily
after
and
he
too
rose
up
and
stood
then
dr
silence
produced
his
candles
and
we
heard
preparations
for
striking
matches
yet
even
before
there
was
light
an
indefinable
sensation
of
awe
came
over
us
all
in
this
hole
in
the
sand
some
three
feet
under
ground
we
stood
side
by
side
cramped
and
huddled
struck
suddenly
with
an
over
whelming
apprehension
of
something
ancient
something
formidable
something
incalculably
wonderful
that
touched
in
each
one
of
us
a
sense
of
the
sublime
and
the
terrible
even
before
we
could
see
an
inch
before
our
faces
i
know
not
how
to
express
in
language
this
singular
emotion
that
caught
us
here
in
utter
darkness
touching
no
sense
directly
it
seemed
yet
with
the
recognition
that
before
us
in
the
blackness
of
this
underground
night
there
lay
something
that
was
mighty
with
the
mightiness
of
long
past
ages
i
felt
colonel
wragge
press
in
closely
to
my
side
and
i
understood
the
pressure
and
welcomed
it
no
human
touch
to
me
at
least
has
ever
been
more
eloquent
then
the
match
flared
a
thousand
shadows
fled
on
black
wings
and
i
saw
john
silence
fumbling
with
the
candle
his
face
lit
up
grotesquely
by
the
flickering
light
below
it
i
had
dreaded
this
light
yet
when
it
came
there
was
apparently
nothing
to
explain
the
profound
sensations
of
dread
that
preceded
it
we
stood
in
a
small
vaulted
chamber
in
the
sand
the
sides
and
roof
shored
with
bars
of
wood
and
the
ground
laid
roughly
with
what
seemed
to
be
tiles
it
was
six
feet
high
so
that
we
could
all
stand
comfortably
and
may
have
been
ten
feet
long
by
eight
feet
wide
upon
the
wooden
pillars
at
the
side
i
saw
that
egyptian
hieroglyphics
had
been
rudely
traced
by
burning
dr
silence
lit
three
candles
and
handed
one
to
each
of
us
he
placed
a
fourth
in
the
sand
against
the
wall
on
his
right
and
another
to
mark
the
entrance
to
the
tunnel
we
stood
and
stared
about
us
instinctively
holding
our
breath
empty
by
god
exclaimed
colonel
wragge
his
voice
trembled
with
excitement
and
then
as
his
eyes
rested
on
the
ground
he
added
and
footsteps--look--footsteps
in
the
sand
dr
silence
said
nothing
he
stooped
down
and
began
to
make
a
search
of
the
chamber
and
as
he
moved
my
eyes
followed
his
crouching
figure
and
noted
the
queer
distorted
shadows
that
poured
over
the
walls
and
ceiling
after
him
here
and
there
thin
trickles
of
loose
sand
ran
fizzing
down
the
sides
the
atmosphere
heavily
charged
with
faint
yet
pungent
odours
lay
utterly
still
and
the
flames
of
the
candles
might
have
been
painted
on
the
air
for
all
the
movement
they
betrayed
and
as
i
watched
it
was
almost
necessary
to
persuade
myself
forcibly
that
i
was
only
standing
upright
with
difficulty
in
this
little
sand-hole
of
a
modern
garden
in
the
south
of
england
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
stood
as
in
vision
at
the
entrance
of
some
vast
rock-hewn
temple
far
far
down
the
river
of
time
the
illusion
was
powerful
and
persisted
granite
columns
that
rose
to
heaven
piled
themselves
about
me
majestically
uprearing
and
a
roof
like
the
sky
itself
spread
above
a
line
of
colossal
figures
that
moved
in
shadowy
procession
along
endless
and
stupendous
aisles
this
huge
and
splendid
fantasy
borne
i
knew
not
whence
possessed
me
so
vividly
that
i
was
actually
obliged
to
concentrate
my
attention
upon
the
small
stooping
figure
of
the
doctor
as
he
groped
about
the
walls
in
order
to
keep
the
eye
of
imagination
on
the
scene
before
me
but
the
limited
space
rendered
a
long
search
out
of
the
question
and
his
footsteps
instead
of
shuffling
through
loose
sand
presently
struck
something
of
a
different
quality
that
gave
forth
a
hollow
and
resounding
echo
he
stooped
to
examine
more
closely
he
was
standing
exactly
in
the
centre
of
the
little
chamber
when
this
happened
and
he
at
once
began
scraping
away
the
sand
with
his
feet
in
less
than
a
minute
a
smooth
surface
became
visible--the
surface
of
a
wooden
covering
the
next
thing
i
saw
was
that
he
had
raised
it
and
was
peering
down
into
a
space
below
instantly
a
strong
odour
of
nitre
and
bitumen
mingled
with
the
strange
perfume
of
unknown
and
powdered
aromatics
rose
up
from
the
uncovered
space
and
filled
the
vault
stinging
the
throat
and
making
the
eyes
water
and
smart
the
mummy
whispered
dr
silence
looking
up
into
our
faces
over
his
candle
and
as
he
said
the
word
i
felt
the
soldier
lurch
against
me
and
heard
his
breathing
in
my
very
ear
the
mummy
he
repeated
under
his
breath
as
we
pressed
forward
to
look
it
is
difficult
to
say
exactly
why
the
sight
should
have
stirred
in
me
so
prodigious
an
emotion
of
wonder
and
veneration
for
i
have
had
not
a
little
to
do
with
mummies
have
unwound
scores
of
them
and
even
experimented
magically
with
not
a
few
but
there
was
something
in
the
sight
of
that
grey
and
silent
figure
lying
in
its
modern
box
of
lead
and
wood
at
the
bottom
of
this
sandy
grave
swathed
in
the
bandages
of
centuries
and
wrapped
in
the
perfumed
linen
that
the
priests
of
egypt
had
prayed
over
with
their
mighty
enchantments
thousands
of
years
before--something
in
the
sight
of
it
lying
there
and
breathing
its
own
spice-laden
atmosphere
even
in
the
darkness
of
its
exile
in
this
remote
land
something
that
pierced
to
the
very
core
of
my
being
and
touched
that
root
of
awe
which
slumbers
in
every
man
near
the
birth
of
tears
and
the
passion
of
true
worship
i
remember
turning
quickly
from
the
colonel
lest
he
should
see
my
emotion
yet
fail
to
understand
its
cause
turn
and
clutch
john
silence
by
the
arm
and
then
fall
trembling
to
see
that
he
too
had
lowered
his
head
and
was
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
a
kind
of
whirling
storm
came
over
me
rising
out
of
i
know
not
what
utter
deeps
of
memory
and
in
a
whiteness
of
vision
i
heard
the
magical
old
chauntings
from
the
book
of
the
dead
and
saw
the
gods
pass
by
in
dim
procession
the
mighty
immemorial
beings
who
were
yet
themselves
only
the
personified
attributes
of
the
true
gods
the
god
with
the
eyes
of
fire
the
god
with
the
face
of
smoke
i
saw
again
anubis
the
dog-faced
deity
and
the
children
of
horus
eternal
watcher
of
the
ages
as
they
swathed
osiris
the
first
mummy
of
the
world
in
the
scented
and
mystic
bands
and
i
tasted
again
something
of
the
ecstasy
of
the
justified
soul
as
it
embarked
in
the
golden
boat
of
ra
and
journeyed
onwards
to
rest
in
the
fields
of
the
blessed
and
then
as
dr
silence
with
infinite
reverence
stooped
and
touched
the
still
face
so
dreadfully
staring
with
its
painted
eyes
there
rose
again
to
our
nostrils
wave
upon
wave
of
this
perfume
of
thousands
of
years
and
time
fled
backwards
like
a
thing
of
naught
showing
me
in
haunted
panorama
the
most
wonderful
dream
of
the
whole
world
a
gentle
hissing
became
audible
in
the
air
and
the
doctor
moved
quickly
backwards
it
came
close
to
our
faces
and
then
seemed
to
play
about
the
walls
and
ceiling
the
last
of
the
fire--still
waiting
for
its
full
accomplishment
he
muttered
but
i
heard
both
words
and
hissing
as
things
far
away
for
i
was
still
busy
with
the
journey
of
the
soul
through
the
seven
halls
of
death
listening
for
echoes
of
the
grandest
ritual
ever
known
to
men
the
earthen
plates
covered
with
hieroglyphics
still
lay
beside
the
mummy
and
round
it
carefully
arranged
at
the
points
of
the
compass
stood
the
four
jars
with
the
heads
of
the
hawk
the
jackal
the
cynocephalus
and
man
the
jars
in
which
were
placed
the
hair
the
nail
parings
the
heart
and
other
special
portions
of
the
body
even
the
amulets
the
mirror
the
blue
clay
statues
of
the
ka
and
the
lamp
with
seven
wicks
were
there
only
the
sacred
scarabaeus
was
missing
not
only
has
it
been
torn
from
its
ancient
resting-place
i
heard
dr
silence
saying
in
a
solemn
voice
as
he
looked
at
colonel
wragge
with
fixed
gaze
but
it
has
been
partially
unwound--he
pointed
to
the
wrappings
of
the
breast--and--the
scarabaeus
has
been
removed
from
the
throat
the
hissing
that
was
like
the
hissing
of
an
invisible
flame
had
ceased
only
from
time
to
time
we
heard
it
as
though
it
passed
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
tunnel
and
we
stood
looking
into
each
other's
faces
without
speaking
presently
colonel
wragge
made
a
great
effort
and
braced
himself
i
heard
the
sound
catch
in
his
throat
before
the
words
actually
became
audible
my
sister
he
said
very
low
and
then
there
followed
a
long
pause
broken
at
length
by
john
silence
it
must
be
replaced
he
said
significantly
i
knew
nothing
the
soldier
said
forcing
himself
to
speak
the
words
he
hated
saying
absolutely
nothing
it
must
be
returned
repeated
the
other
if
it
is
not
now
too
late
for
i
fear--i
fear--
colonel
wragge
made
a
movement
of
assent
with
his
head
it
shall
be
he
said
the
place
was
still
as
the
grave
i
do
not
know
what
it
was
then
that
made
us
all
three
turn
round
with
so
sudden
a
start
for
there
was
no
sound
audible
to
my
ears
at
least
the
doctor
was
on
the
point
of
replacing
the
lid
over
the
mummy
when
he
straightened
up
as
if
he
had
been
shot
there's
something
coming
said
colonel
wragge
under
his
breath
and
the
doctor's
eyes
peering
down
the
small
opening
of
the
tunnel
showed
me
the
true
direction
a
distant
shuffling
noise
became
distinctly
audible
coming
from
a
point
about
half-way
down
the
tunnel
we
had
so
laboriously
penetrated
it's
the
sand
falling
in
i
said
though
i
knew
it
was
foolish
no
said
the
colonel
calmly
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
have
the
ring
of
iron
i've
heard
it
for
some
time
past
it
is
something
alive--and
it
is
coming
nearer
he
stared
about
him
with
a
look
of
resolution
that
made
his
face
almost
noble
the
horror
in
his
heart
was
overmastering
yet
he
stood
there
prepared
for
anything
that
might
come
there's
no
other
way
out
john
silence
said
he
leaned
the
lid
against
the
sand
and
waited
i
knew
by
the
masklike
expression
of
his
face
the
pallor
and
the
steadiness
of
the
eyes
that
he
anticipated
something
that
might
be
very
terrible--appalling
the
colonel
and
myself
stood
on
either
side
of
the
opening
i
still
held
my
candle
and
was
ashamed
of
the
way
it
shook
dripping
the
grease
all
over
me
but
the
soldier
had
set
his
into
the
sand
just
behind
his
feet
thoughts
of
being
buried
alive
of
being
smothered
like
rats
in
a
trap
of
being
caught
and
done
to
death
by
some
invisible
and
merciless
force
we
could
not
grapple
with
rushed
into
my
mind
then
i
thought
of
fire--of
suffocation--of
being
roasted
alive
the
perspiration
began
to
pour
from
my
face
steady
came
the
voice
of
dr
silence
to
me
through
the
vault
for
five
minutes
that
seemed
fifty
we
stood
waiting
looking
from
each
other's
faces
to
the
mummy
and
from
the
mummy
to
the
hole
and
all
the
time
the
shuffling
sound
soft
and
stealthy
came
gradually
nearer
the
tension
for
me
at
least
was
very
near
the
breaking
point
when
at
last
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
reached
the
edge
it
was
hidden
for
a
moment
just
behind
the
broken
rim
of
soil
a
jet
of
sand
shaken
by
the
close
vibration
trickled
down
on
to
the
ground
i
have
never
in
my
life
seen
anything
fall
with
such
laborious
leisure
the
next
second
uttering
a
cry
of
curious
quality
it
came
into
view
and
it
was
far
more
distressingly
horrible
than
anything
i
had
anticipated
for
the
sight
of
some
egyptian
monster
some
god
of
the
tombs
or
even
of
some
demon
of
fire
i
think
i
was
already
half
prepared
but
when
instead
i
saw
the
white
visage
of
miss
wragge
framed
in
that
round
opening
of
sand
followed
by
her
body
crawling
on
all
fours
her
eyes
bulging
and
reflecting
the
yellow
glare
of
the
candles
my
first
instinct
was
to
turn
and
run
like
a
frantic
animal
seeking
a
way
of
escape
but
dr
silence
who
seemed
no
whit
surprised
caught
my
arm
and
steadied
me
and
we
both
saw
the
colonel
then
drop
upon
his
knees
and
come
thus
to
a
level
with
his
sister
for
more
than
a
whole
minute
as
though
struck
in
stone
the
two
faces
gazed
silently
at
each
other
hers
for
all
the
dreadful
emotion
in
it
more
like
a
gargoyle
than
anything
human
and
his
white
and
blank
with
an
expression
that
was
beyond
either
astonishment
or
alarm
she
looked
up
he
looked
down
it
was
a
picture
in
a
nightmare
and
the
candle
stuck
in
the
sand
close
to
the
hole
threw
upon
it
the
glare
of
impromptu
footlights
then
john
silence
moved
forward
and
spoke
in
a
voice
that
was
very
low
yet
perfectly
calm
and
natural
i
am
glad
you
have
come
he
said
you
are
the
one
person
whose
presence
at
this
moment
is
most
required
and
i
hope
that
you
may
yet
be
in
time
to
appease
the
anger
of
the
fire
and
to
bring
peace
again
to
your
household
and
he
added
lower
still
so
that
no
one
heard
it
but
myself
safety
to
yourself
and
while
her
brother
stumbled
backwards
crushing
a
candle
into
the
sand
in
his
awkwardness
the
old
lady
crawled
farther
into
the
vaulted
chamber
and
slowly
rose
upon
her
feet
at
the
sight
of
the
wrapped
figure
of
the
mummy
i
was
fully
prepared
to
see
her
scream
and
faint
but
on
the
contrary
to
my
complete
amazement
she
merely
bowed
her
head
and
dropped
quietly
upon
her
knees
then
after
a
pause
of
more
than
a
minute
she
raised
her
eyes
to
the
roof
and
her
lips
began
to
mutter
as
in
prayer
her
right
hand
meanwhile
which
had
been
fumbling
for
some
time
at
her
throat
suddenly
came
away
and
before
the
gaze
of
all
of
us
she
held
it
out
palm
upwards
over
the
grey
and
ancient
figure
outstretched
below
and
in
it
we
beheld
glistening
the
green
jasper
of
the
stolen
scarabaeus
her
brother
leaning
heavily
against
the
wall
behind
uttered
a
sound
that
was
half
cry
half
exclamation
but
john
silence
standing
directly
in
front
of
her
merely
fixed
his
eyes
on
her
and
pointed
downwards
to
the
staring
face
below
replace
it
he
said
sternly
where
it
belongs
miss
wragge
was
kneeling
at
the
feet
of
the
mummy
when
this
happened
we
three
men
all
had
our
eyes
riveted
on
what
followed
only
the
reader
who
by
some
remote
chance
may
have
witnessed
a
line
of
mummies
freshly
laid
from
their
tombs
upon
the
sand
slowly
stir
and
bend
as
the
heat
of
the
egyptian
sun
warms
their
ancient
bodies
into
the
semblance
of
life
can
form
any
conception
of
the
ultimate
horror
we
experienced
when
the
silent
figure
before
us
moved
in
its
grave
of
lead
and
sand
slowly
before
our
eyes
it
writhed
and
with
a
faint
rustling
of
the
immemorial
cerements
rose
up
and
through
sightless
and
bandaged
eyes
stared
across
the
yellow
candlelight
at
the
woman
who
had
violated
it
i
tried
to
move--her
brother
tried
to
move--but
the
sand
seemed
to
hold
our
feet
i
tried
to
cry--her
brother
tried
to
cry--but
the
sand
seemed
to
fill
our
lungs
and
throat
we
could
only
stare--and
even
so
the
sand
seemed
to
rise
like
a
desert
storm
and
cloud
our
vision

and
when
i
managed
at
length
to
open
my
eyes
again
the
mummy
was
lying
once
more
upon
its
back
motionless
the
shrunken
and
painted
face
upturned
towards
the
ceiling
and
the
old
lady
had
tumbled
forward
and
was
lying
in
the
semblance
of
death
with
her
head
and
arms
upon
its
crumbling
body
but
upon
the
wrappings
of
the
throat
i
saw
the
green
jasper
of
the
sacred
scarabaeus
shining
again
like
a
living
eye
colonel
wragge
and
the
doctor
recovered
themselves
long
before
i
did
and
i
found
myself
helping
them
clumsily
and
unintelligently
to
raise
the
frail
body
of
the
old
lady
while
john
silence
carefully
replaced
the
covering
over
the
grave
and
scraped
back
the
sand
with
his
foot
while
he
issued
brief
directions
i
heard
his
voice
as
in
a
dream
but
the
journey
back
along
that
cramped
tunnel
weighted
by
a
dead
woman
blinded
with
sand
suffocated
with
heat
was
in
no
sense
a
dream
it
took
us
the
best
part
of
half
an
hour
to
reach
the
open
air
and
even
then
we
had
to
wait
a
considerable
time
for
the
appearance
of
dr
silence
we
carried
her
undiscovered
into
the
house
and
up
to
her
own
room
the
mummy
will
cause
no
further
disturbance
i
heard
dr
silence
say
to
our
host
later
that
evening
as
we
prepared
to
drive
for
the
night
train
provided
always
he
added
significantly
that
you
and
yours
cause
it
no
disturbance
it
was
in
a
dream
too
that
we
left
you
did
not
see
her
face
i
know
he
said
to
me
as
we
wrapped
our
rugs
about
us
in
the
empty
compartment
and
when
i
shook
my
head
quite
unable
to
explain
the
instinct
that
had
come
to
me
not
to
look
he
turned
toward
me
his
face
pale
and
genuinely
sad
scorched
and
blasted
he
whispered
