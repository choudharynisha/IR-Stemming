the
turn
of
the
screw
the
story
had
held
us
round
the
fire
sufficiently
breathless
but
except
the
obvious
remark
that
it
was
gruesome
as
on
christmas
eve
in
an
old
house
a
strange
tale
should
essentially
be
i
remember
no
comment
uttered
till
somebody
happened
to
say
that
it
was
the
only
case
he
had
met
in
which
such
a
visitation
had
fallen
on
a
child
the
case
i
may
mention
was
that
of
an
apparition
in
just
such
an
old
house
as
had
gathered
us
for
the
occasionâ€”an
appearance
of
a
dreadful
kind
to
a
little
boy
sleeping
in
the
room
with
his
mother
and
waking
her
up
in
the
terror
of
it
waking
her
not
to
dissipate
his
dread
and
soothe
him
to
sleep
again
but
to
encounter
also
herself
before
she
had
succeeded
in
doing
so
the
same
sight
that
had
shaken
him
it
was
this
observation
that
drew
from
douglasâ€”not
immediately
but
later
in
the
eveningâ€”a
reply
that
had
the
interesting
consequence
to
which
i
call
attention
someone
else
told
a
story
not
particularly
effective
which
i
saw
he
was
not
following
this
i
took
for
a
sign
that
he
had
himself
something
to
produce
and
that
we
should
only
have
to
wait
we
waited
in
fact
till
two
nights
later
but
that
same
evening
before
we
scattered
he
brought
out
what
was
in
his
mind
â€œi
quite
agreeâ€”in
regard
to
griffinâ€™s
ghost
or
whatever
it
wasâ€”that
its
appearing
first
to
the
little
boy
at
so
tender
an
age
adds
a
particular
touch
but
itâ€™s
not
the
first
occurrence
of
its
charming
kind
that
i
know
to
have
involved
a
child
if
the
child
gives
the
effect
another
turn
of
the
screw
what
do
you
say
to
two
childrenâ€”â€
â€œwe
say
of
courseâ€
somebody
exclaimed
â€œthat
they
give
two
turns
also
that
we
want
to
hear
about
themâ€
i
can
see
douglas
there
before
the
fire
to
which
he
had
got
up
to
present
his
back
looking
down
at
his
interlocutor
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
â€œnobody
but
me
till
now
has
ever
heard
itâ€™s
quite
too
horribleâ€
this
naturally
was
declared
by
several
voices
to
give
the
thing
the
utmost
price
and
our
friend
with
quiet
art
prepared
his
triumph
by
turning
his
eyes
over
the
rest
of
us
and
going
on
â€œitâ€™s
beyond
everything
nothing
at
all
that
i
know
touches
itâ€
â€œfor
sheer
terrorâ€
i
remember
asking
he
seemed
to
say
it
was
not
so
simple
as
that
to
be
really
at
a
loss
how
to
qualify
it
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
made
a
little
wincing
grimace
â€œfor
dreadfulâ€”dreadfulnessâ€
â€œoh
how
deliciousâ€
cried
one
of
the
women
he
took
no
notice
of
her
he
looked
at
me
but
as
if
instead
of
me
he
saw
what
he
spoke
of
â€œfor
general
uncanny
ugliness
and
horror
and
painâ€
â€œwell
thenâ€
i
said
â€œjust
sit
right
down
and
beginâ€
he
turned
round
to
the
fire
gave
a
kick
to
a
log
watched
it
an
instant
then
as
he
faced
us
again
â€œi
canâ€™t
begin
i
shall
have
to
send
to
townâ€
there
was
a
unanimous
groan
at
this
and
much
reproach
after
which
in
his
preoccupied
way
he
explained
â€œthe
storyâ€™s
written
itâ€™s
in
a
locked
drawerâ€”it
has
not
been
out
for
years
i
could
write
to
my
man
and
enclose
the
key
he
could
send
down
the
packet
as
he
finds
itâ€
it
was
to
me
in
particular
that
he
appeared
to
propound
thisâ€”appeared
almost
to
appeal
for
aid
not
to
hesitate
he
had
broken
a
thickness
of
ice
the
formation
of
many
a
winter
had
had
his
reasons
for
a
long
silence
the
others
resented
postponement
but
it
was
just
his
scruples
that
charmed
me
i
adjured
him
to
write
by
the
first
post
and
to
agree
with
us
for
an
early
hearing
then
i
asked
him
if
the
experience
in
question
had
been
his
own
to
this
his
answer
was
prompt
â€œoh
thank
god
noâ€
â€œand
is
the
record
yours
you
took
the
thing
downâ€
â€œnothing
but
the
impression
i
took
that
hereâ€â€”he
tapped
his
heart
â€œiâ€™ve
never
lost
itâ€
â€œthen
your
manuscriptâ€”â€
â€œis
in
old
faded
ink
and
in
the
most
beautiful
handâ€
he
hung
fire
again
â€œa
womanâ€™s
she
has
been
dead
these
twenty
years
she
sent
me
the
pages
in
question
before
she
diedâ€
they
were
all
listening
now
and
of
course
there
was
somebody
to
be
arch
or
at
any
rate
to
draw
the
inference
but
if
he
put
the
inference
by
without
a
smile
it
was
also
without
irritation
â€œshe
was
a
most
charming
person
but
she
was
ten
years
older
than
i
she
was
my
sisterâ€™s
governessâ€
he
quietly
said
â€œshe
was
the
most
agreeable
woman
iâ€™ve
ever
known
in
her
position
she
would
have
been
worthy
of
any
whatever
it
was
long
ago
and
this
episode
was
long
before
i
was
at
trinity
and
i
found
her
at
home
on
my
coming
down
the
second
summer
i
was
much
there
that
yearâ€”it
was
a
beautiful
one
and
we
had
in
her
off-hours
some
strolls
and
talks
in
the
gardenâ€”talks
in
which
she
struck
me
as
awfully
clever
and
nice
oh
yes
donâ€™t
grin
i
liked
her
extremely
and
am
glad
to
this
day
to
think
she
liked
me
too
if
she
hadnâ€™t
she
wouldnâ€™t
have
told
me
she
had
never
told
anyone
it
wasnâ€™t
simply
that
she
said
so
but
that
i
knew
she
hadnâ€™t
i
was
sure
i
could
see
youâ€™ll
easily
judge
why
when
you
hearâ€
â€œbecause
the
thing
had
been
such
a
scareâ€
he
continued
to
fix
me
â€œyouâ€™ll
easily
judgeâ€
he
repeated
â€œyou
willâ€
i
fixed
him
too
â€œi
see
she
was
in
loveâ€
he
laughed
for
the
first
time
â€œyou
are
acute
yes
she
was
in
love
that
is
she
had
been
that
came
outâ€”she
couldnâ€™t
tell
her
story
without
its
coming
out
i
saw
it
and
she
saw
i
saw
it
but
neither
of
us
spoke
of
it
i
remember
the
time
and
the
placeâ€”the
corner
of
the
lawn
the
shade
of
the
great
beeches
and
the
long
hot
summer
afternoon
it
wasnâ€™t
a
scene
for
a
shudder
but
ohâ€”â€
he
quitted
the
fire
and
dropped
back
into
his
chair
â€œyouâ€™ll
receive
the
packet
thursday
morningâ€
i
inquired
â€œprobably
not
till
the
second
postâ€
â€œwell
then
after
dinnerâ€”â€
â€œyouâ€™ll
all
meet
me
hereâ€
he
looked
us
round
again
â€œisnâ€™t
anybody
goingâ€
it
was
almost
the
tone
of
hope
â€œeverybody
will
stayâ€
â€œi
willâ€â€”and
â€œi
willâ€
cried
the
ladies
whose
departure
had
been
fixed
mrs
griffin
however
expressed
the
need
for
a
little
more
light
â€œwho
was
it
she
was
in
love
withâ€
â€œthe
story
will
tellâ€
i
took
upon
myself
to
reply
â€œoh
i
canâ€™t
wait
for
the
storyâ€
â€œthe
story
wonâ€™t
tellâ€
said
douglas
â€œnot
in
any
literal
vulgar
wayâ€
â€œmoreâ€™s
the
pity
then
thatâ€™s
the
only
way
i
ever
understandâ€
â€œwonâ€™t
you
tell
douglasâ€
somebody
else
inquired
he
sprang
to
his
feet
again
â€œyesâ€”tomorrow
now
i
must
go
to
bed
good
nightâ€
and
quickly
catching
up
a
candlestick
he
left
us
slightly
bewildered
from
our
end
of
the
great
brown
hall
we
heard
his
step
on
the
stair
whereupon
mrs
griffin
spoke
â€œwell
if
i
donâ€™t
know
who
she
was
in
love
with
i
know
who
he
wasâ€
â€œshe
was
ten
years
olderâ€
said
her
husband
â€œraison
de
plusâ€”at
that
age
but
itâ€™s
rather
nice
his
long
reticenceâ€
â€œforty
yearsâ€
griffin
put
in
â€œwith
this
outbreak
at
lastâ€
â€œthe
outbreakâ€
i
returned
â€œwill
make
a
tremendous
occasion
of
thursday
nightâ€
and
everyone
so
agreed
with
me
that
in
the
light
of
it
we
lost
all
attention
for
everything
else
the
last
story
however
incomplete
and
like
the
mere
opening
of
a
serial
had
been
told
we
handshook
and
â€œcandlestuckâ€
as
somebody
said
and
went
to
bed
i
knew
the
next
day
that
a
letter
containing
the
key
had
by
the
first
post
gone
off
to
his
london
apartments
but
in
spite
ofâ€”or
perhaps
just
on
account
ofâ€”the
eventual
diffusion
of
this
knowledge
we
quite
let
him
alone
till
after
dinner
till
such
an
hour
of
the
evening
in
fact
as
might
best
accord
with
the
kind
of
emotion
on
which
our
hopes
were
fixed
then
he
became
as
communicative
as
we
could
desire
and
indeed
gave
us
his
best
reason
for
being
so
we
had
it
from
him
again
before
the
fire
in
the
hall
as
we
had
had
our
mild
wonders
of
the
previous
night
it
appeared
that
the
narrative
he
had
promised
to
read
us
really
required
for
a
proper
intelligence
a
few
words
of
prologue
let
me
say
here
distinctly
to
have
done
with
it
that
this
narrative
from
an
exact
transcript
of
my
own
made
much
later
is
what
i
shall
presently
give
poor
douglas
before
his
deathâ€”when
it
was
in
sightâ€”committed
to
me
the
manuscript
that
reached
him
on
the
third
of
these
days
and
that
on
the
same
spot
with
immense
effect
he
began
to
read
to
our
hushed
little
circle
on
the
night
of
the
fourth
the
departing
ladies
who
had
said
they
would
stay
didnâ€™t
of
course
thank
heaven
stay
they
departed
in
consequence
of
arrangements
made
in
a
rage
of
curiosity
as
they
professed
produced
by
the
touches
with
which
he
had
already
worked
us
up
but
that
only
made
his
little
final
auditory
more
compact
and
select
kept
it
round
the
hearth
subject
to
a
common
thrill
the
first
of
these
touches
conveyed
that
the
written
statement
took
up
the
tale
at
a
point
after
it
had
in
a
manner
begun
the
fact
to
be
in
possession
of
was
therefore
that
his
old
friend
the
youngest
of
several
daughters
of
a
poor
country
parson
had
at
the
age
of
twenty
on
taking
service
for
the
first
time
in
the
schoolroom
come
up
to
london
in
trepidation
to
answer
in
person
an
advertisement
that
had
already
placed
her
in
brief
correspondence
with
the
advertiser
this
person
proved
on
her
presenting
herself
for
judgment
at
a
house
in
harley
street
that
impressed
her
as
vast
and
imposingâ€”this
prospective
patron
proved
a
gentleman
a
bachelor
in
the
prime
of
life
such
a
figure
as
had
never
risen
save
in
a
dream
or
an
old
novel
before
a
fluttered
anxious
girl
out
of
a
hampshire
vicarage
one
could
easily
fix
his
type
it
never
happily
dies
out
he
was
handsome
and
bold
and
pleasant
off-hand
and
gay
and
kind
he
struck
her
inevitably
as
gallant
and
splendid
but
what
took
her
most
of
all
and
gave
her
the
courage
she
afterward
showed
was
that
he
put
the
whole
thing
to
her
as
a
kind
of
favor
an
obligation
he
should
gratefully
incur
she
conceived
him
as
rich
but
as
fearfully
extravagantâ€”saw
him
all
in
a
glow
of
high
fashion
of
good
looks
of
expensive
habits
of
charming
ways
with
women
he
had
for
his
own
town
residence
a
big
house
filled
with
the
spoils
of
travel
and
the
trophies
of
the
chase
but
it
was
to
his
country
home
an
old
family
place
in
essex
that
he
wished
her
immediately
to
proceed
he
had
been
left
by
the
death
of
their
parents
in
india
guardian
to
a
small
nephew
and
a
small
niece
children
of
a
younger
a
military
brother
whom
he
had
lost
two
years
before
these
children
were
by
the
strangest
of
chances
for
a
man
in
his
positionâ€”a
lone
man
without
the
right
sort
of
experience
or
a
grain
of
patienceâ€”very
heavily
on
his
hands
it
had
all
been
a
great
worry
and
on
his
own
part
doubtless
a
series
of
blunders
but
he
immensely
pitied
the
poor
chicks
and
had
done
all
he
could
had
in
particular
sent
them
down
to
his
other
house
the
proper
place
for
them
being
of
course
the
country
and
kept
them
there
from
the
first
with
the
best
people
he
could
find
to
look
after
them
parting
even
with
his
own
servants
to
wait
on
them
and
going
down
himself
whenever
he
might
to
see
how
they
were
doing
the
awkward
thing
was
that
they
had
practically
no
other
relations
and
that
his
own
affairs
took
up
all
his
time
he
had
put
them
in
possession
of
bly
which
was
healthy
and
secure
and
had
placed
at
the
head
of
their
little
establishmentâ€”but
below
stairs
onlyâ€”an
excellent
woman
mrs
grose
whom
he
was
sure
his
visitor
would
like
and
who
had
formerly
been
maid
to
his
mother
she
was
now
housekeeper
and
was
also
acting
for
the
time
as
superintendent
to
the
little
girl
of
whom
without
children
of
her
own
she
was
by
good
luck
extremely
fond
there
were
plenty
of
people
to
help
but
of
course
the
young
lady
who
should
go
down
as
governess
would
be
in
supreme
authority
she
would
also
have
in
holidays
to
look
after
the
small
boy
who
had
been
for
a
term
at
schoolâ€”young
as
he
was
to
be
sent
but
what
else
could
be
doneâ€”and
who
as
the
holidays
were
about
to
begin
would
be
back
from
one
day
to
the
other
there
had
been
for
the
two
children
at
first
a
young
lady
whom
they
had
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
she
had
done
for
them
quite
beautifullyâ€”she
was
a
most
respectable
personâ€”till
her
death
the
great
awkwardness
of
which
had
precisely
left
no
alternative
but
the
school
for
little
miles
mrs
grose
since
then
in
the
way
of
manners
and
things
had
done
as
she
could
for
flora
and
there
were
further
a
cook
a
housemaid
a
dairywoman
an
old
pony
an
old
groom
and
an
old
gardener
all
likewise
thoroughly
respectable
so
far
had
douglas
presented
his
picture
when
someone
put
a
question
â€œand
what
did
the
former
governess
die
ofâ€”of
so
much
respectabilityâ€
our
friendâ€™s
answer
was
prompt
â€œthat
will
come
out
i
donâ€™t
anticipateâ€
â€œexcuse
meâ€”i
thought
that
was
just
what
you
are
doingâ€
â€œin
her
successorâ€™s
placeâ€
i
suggested
â€œi
should
have
wished
to
learn
if
the
office
brought
with
itâ€”â€
â€œnecessary
danger
to
lifeâ€
douglas
completed
my
thought
â€œshe
did
wish
to
learn
and
she
did
learn
you
shall
hear
tomorrow
what
she
learned
meanwhile
of
course
the
prospect
struck
her
as
slightly
grim
she
was
young
untried
nervous
it
was
a
vision
of
serious
duties
and
little
company
of
really
great
loneliness
she
hesitatedâ€”took
a
couple
of
days
to
consult
and
consider
but
the
salary
offered
much
exceeded
her
modest
measure
and
on
a
second
interview
she
faced
the
music
she
engagedâ€
and
douglas
with
this
made
a
pause
that
for
the
benefit
of
the
company
moved
me
to
throw
inâ€”
â€œthe
moral
of
which
was
of
course
the
seduction
exercised
by
the
splendid
young
man
she
succumbed
to
itâ€
he
got
up
and
as
he
had
done
the
night
before
went
to
the
fire
gave
a
stir
to
a
log
with
his
foot
then
stood
a
moment
with
his
back
to
us
â€œshe
saw
him
only
twiceâ€
â€œyes
but
thatâ€™s
just
the
beauty
of
her
passionâ€
a
little
to
my
surprise
on
this
douglas
turned
round
to
me
â€œit
was
the
beauty
of
it
there
were
othersâ€
he
went
on
â€œwho
hadnâ€™t
succumbed
he
told
her
frankly
all
his
difficultyâ€”that
for
several
applicants
the
conditions
had
been
prohibitive
they
were
somehow
simply
afraid
it
sounded
dullâ€”it
sounded
strange
and
all
the
more
so
because
of
his
main
conditionâ€
â€œwhich
wasâ€”â€
â€œthat
she
should
never
trouble
himâ€”but
never
never
neither
appeal
nor
complain
nor
write
about
anything
only
meet
all
questions
herself
receive
all
moneys
from
his
solicitor
take
the
whole
thing
over
and
let
him
alone
she
promised
to
do
this
and
she
mentioned
to
me
that
when
for
a
moment
disburdened
delighted
he
held
her
hand
thanking
her
for
the
sacrifice
she
already
felt
rewardedâ€
â€œbut
was
that
all
her
rewardâ€
one
of
the
ladies
asked
â€œshe
never
saw
him
againâ€
â€œohâ€
said
the
lady
which
as
our
friend
immediately
left
us
again
was
the
only
other
word
of
importance
contributed
to
the
subject
till
the
next
night
by
the
corner
of
the
hearth
in
the
best
chair
he
opened
the
faded
red
cover
of
a
thin
old-fashioned
gilt-edged
album
the
whole
thing
took
indeed
more
nights
than
one
but
on
the
first
occasion
the
same
lady
put
another
question
â€œwhat
is
your
titleâ€
â€œi
havenâ€™t
oneâ€
â€œoh
i
haveâ€
i
said
but
douglas
without
heeding
me
had
begun
to
read
with
a
fine
clearness
that
was
like
a
rendering
to
the
ear
of
the
beauty
of
his
authorâ€™s
hand
i
i
remember
the
whole
beginning
as
a
succession
of
flights
and
drops
a
little
seesaw
of
the
right
throbs
and
the
wrong
after
rising
in
town
to
meet
his
appeal
i
had
at
all
events
a
couple
of
very
bad
daysâ€”found
myself
doubtful
again
felt
indeed
sure
i
had
made
a
mistake
in
this
state
of
mind
i
spent
the
long
hours
of
bumping
swinging
coach
that
carried
me
to
the
stopping
place
at
which
i
was
to
be
met
by
a
vehicle
from
the
house
this
convenience
i
was
told
had
been
ordered
and
i
found
toward
the
close
of
the
june
afternoon
a
commodious
fly
in
waiting
for
me
driving
at
that
hour
on
a
lovely
day
through
a
country
to
which
the
summer
sweetness
seemed
to
offer
me
a
friendly
welcome
my
fortitude
mounted
afresh
and
as
we
turned
into
the
avenue
encountered
a
reprieve
that
was
probably
but
a
proof
of
the
point
to
which
it
had
sunk
i
suppose
i
had
expected
or
had
dreaded
something
so
melancholy
that
what
greeted
me
was
a
good
surprise
i
remember
as
a
most
pleasant
impression
the
broad
clear
front
its
open
windows
and
fresh
curtains
and
the
pair
of
maids
looking
out
i
remember
the
lawn
and
the
bright
flowers
and
the
crunch
of
my
wheels
on
the
gravel
and
the
clustered
treetops
over
which
the
rooks
circled
and
cawed
in
the
golden
sky
the
scene
had
a
greatness
that
made
it
a
different
affair
from
my
own
scant
home
and
there
immediately
appeared
at
the
door
with
a
little
girl
in
her
hand
a
civil
person
who
dropped
me
as
decent
a
curtsy
as
if
i
had
been
the
mistress
or
a
distinguished
visitor
i
had
received
in
harley
street
a
narrower
notion
of
the
place
and
that
as
i
recalled
it
made
me
think
the
proprietor
still
more
of
a
gentleman
suggested
that
what
i
was
to
enjoy
might
be
something
beyond
his
promise
i
had
no
drop
again
till
the
next
day
for
i
was
carried
triumphantly
through
the
following
hours
by
my
introduction
to
the
younger
of
my
pupils
the
little
girl
who
accompanied
mrs
grose
appeared
to
me
on
the
spot
a
creature
so
charming
as
to
make
it
a
great
fortune
to
have
to
do
with
her
she
was
the
most
beautiful
child
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
afterward
wondered
that
my
employer
had
not
told
me
more
of
her
i
slept
little
that
nightâ€”i
was
too
much
excited
and
this
astonished
me
too
i
recollect
remained
with
me
adding
to
my
sense
of
the
liberality
with
which
i
was
treated
the
large
impressive
room
one
of
the
best
in
the
house
the
great
state
bed
as
i
almost
felt
it
the
full
figured
draperies
the
long
glasses
in
which
for
the
first
time
i
could
see
myself
from
head
to
foot
all
struck
meâ€”like
the
extraordinary
charm
of
my
small
chargeâ€”as
so
many
things
thrown
in
it
was
thrown
in
as
well
from
the
first
moment
that
i
should
get
on
with
mrs
grose
in
a
relation
over
which
on
my
way
in
the
coach
i
fear
i
had
rather
brooded
the
only
thing
indeed
that
in
this
early
outlook
might
have
made
me
shrink
again
was
the
clear
circumstance
of
her
being
so
glad
to
see
me
i
perceived
within
half
an
hour
that
she
was
so
gladâ€”stout
simple
plain
clean
wholesome
womanâ€”as
to
be
positively
on
her
guard
against
showing
it
too
much
i
wondered
even
then
a
little
why
she
should
wish
not
to
show
it
and
that
with
reflection
with
suspicion
might
of
course
have
made
me
uneasy
but
it
was
a
comfort
that
there
could
be
no
uneasiness
in
a
connection
with
anything
so
beatific
as
the
radiant
image
of
my
little
girl
the
vision
of
whose
angelic
beauty
had
probably
more
than
anything
else
to
do
with
the
restlessness
that
before
morning
made
me
several
times
rise
and
wander
about
my
room
to
take
in
the
whole
picture
and
prospect
to
watch
from
my
open
window
the
faint
summer
dawn
to
look
at
such
portions
of
the
rest
of
the
house
as
i
could
catch
and
to
listen
while
in
the
fading
dusk
the
first
birds
began
to
twitter
for
the
possible
recurrence
of
a
sound
or
two
less
natural
and
not
without
but
within
that
i
had
fancied
i
heard
there
had
been
a
moment
when
i
believed
i
recognized
faint
and
far
the
cry
of
a
child
there
had
been
another
when
i
found
myself
just
consciously
starting
as
at
the
passage
before
my
door
of
a
light
footstep
but
these
fancies
were
not
marked
enough
not
to
be
thrown
off
and
it
is
only
in
the
light
or
the
gloom
i
should
rather
say
of
other
and
subsequent
matters
that
they
now
come
back
to
me
to
watch
teach
â€œformâ€
little
flora
would
too
evidently
be
the
making
of
a
happy
and
useful
life
it
had
been
agreed
between
us
downstairs
that
after
this
first
occasion
i
should
have
her
as
a
matter
of
course
at
night
her
small
white
bed
being
already
arranged
to
that
end
in
my
room
what
i
had
undertaken
was
the
whole
care
of
her
and
she
had
remained
just
this
last
time
with
mrs
grose
only
as
an
effect
of
our
consideration
for
my
inevitable
strangeness
and
her
natural
timidity
in
spite
of
this
timidityâ€”which
the
child
herself
in
the
oddest
way
in
the
world
had
been
perfectly
frank
and
brave
about
allowing
it
without
a
sign
of
uncomfortable
consciousness
with
the
deep
sweet
serenity
indeed
of
one
of
raphaelâ€™s
holy
infants
to
be
discussed
to
be
imputed
to
her
and
to
determine
usâ€”i
feel
quite
sure
she
would
presently
like
me
it
was
part
of
what
i
already
liked
mrs
grose
herself
for
the
pleasure
i
could
see
her
feel
in
my
admiration
and
wonder
as
i
sat
at
supper
with
four
tall
candles
and
with
my
pupil
in
a
high
chair
and
a
bib
brightly
facing
me
between
them
over
bread
and
milk
there
were
naturally
things
that
in
floraâ€™s
presence
could
pass
between
us
only
as
prodigious
and
gratified
looks
obscure
and
roundabout
allusions
â€œand
the
little
boyâ€”does
he
look
like
her
is
he
too
so
very
remarkableâ€
one
wouldnâ€™t
flatter
a
child
â€œoh
miss
most
remarkable
if
you
think
well
of
this
oneâ€â€”and
she
stood
there
with
a
plate
in
her
hand
beaming
at
our
companion
who
looked
from
one
of
us
to
the
other
with
placid
heavenly
eyes
that
contained
nothing
to
check
us
â€œyes
if
i
doâ€”â€
â€œyou
will
be
carried
away
by
the
little
gentlemanâ€
â€œwell
that
i
think
is
what
i
came
forâ€”to
be
carried
away
iâ€™m
afraid
howeverâ€
i
remember
feeling
the
impulse
to
add
â€œiâ€™m
rather
easily
carried
away
i
was
carried
away
in
londonâ€
i
can
still
see
mrs
groseâ€™s
broad
face
as
she
took
this
in
â€œin
harley
streetâ€
â€œin
harley
streetâ€
â€œwell
miss
youâ€™re
not
the
firstâ€”and
you
wonâ€™t
be
the
lastâ€
â€œoh
iâ€™ve
no
pretensionâ€
i
could
laugh
â€œto
being
the
only
one
my
other
pupil
at
any
rate
as
i
understand
comes
back
tomorrowâ€
â€œnot
tomorrowâ€”friday
miss
he
arrives
as
you
did
by
the
coach
under
care
of
the
guard
and
is
to
be
met
by
the
same
carriageâ€
i
forthwith
expressed
that
the
proper
as
well
as
the
pleasant
and
friendly
thing
would
be
therefore
that
on
the
arrival
of
the
public
conveyance
i
should
be
in
waiting
for
him
with
his
little
sister
an
idea
in
which
mrs
grose
concurred
so
heartily
that
i
somehow
took
her
manner
as
a
kind
of
comforting
pledgeâ€”never
falsified
thank
heavenâ€”that
we
should
on
every
question
be
quite
at
one
oh
she
was
glad
i
was
there
what
i
felt
the
next
day
was
i
suppose
nothing
that
could
be
fairly
called
a
reaction
from
the
cheer
of
my
arrival
it
was
probably
at
the
most
only
a
slight
oppression
produced
by
a
fuller
measure
of
the
scale
as
i
walked
round
them
gazed
up
at
them
took
them
in
of
my
new
circumstances
they
had
as
it
were
an
extent
and
mass
for
which
i
had
not
been
prepared
and
in
the
presence
of
which
i
found
myself
freshly
a
little
scared
as
well
as
a
little
proud
lessons
in
this
agitation
certainly
suffered
some
delay
i
reflected
that
my
first
duty
was
by
the
gentlest
arts
i
could
contrive
to
win
the
child
into
the
sense
of
knowing
me
i
spent
the
day
with
her
out-of-doors
i
arranged
with
her
to
her
great
satisfaction
that
it
should
be
she
she
only
who
might
show
me
the
place
she
showed
it
step
by
step
and
room
by
room
and
secret
by
secret
with
droll
delightful
childish
talk
about
it
and
with
the
result
in
half
an
hour
of
our
becoming
immense
friends
young
as
she
was
i
was
struck
throughout
our
little
tour
with
her
confidence
and
courage
with
the
way
in
empty
chambers
and
dull
corridors
on
crooked
staircases
that
made
me
pause
and
even
on
the
summit
of
an
old
machicolated
square
tower
that
made
me
dizzy
her
morning
music
her
disposition
to
tell
me
so
many
more
things
than
she
asked
rang
out
and
led
me
on
i
have
not
seen
bly
since
the
day
i
left
it
and
i
daresay
that
to
my
older
and
more
informed
eyes
it
would
now
appear
sufficiently
contracted
but
as
my
little
conductress
with
her
hair
of
gold
and
her
frock
of
blue
danced
before
me
round
corners
and
pattered
down
passages
i
had
the
view
of
a
castle
of
romance
inhabited
by
a
rosy
sprite
such
a
place
as
would
somehow
for
diversion
of
the
young
idea
take
all
color
out
of
storybooks
and
fairytales
wasnâ€™t
it
just
a
storybook
over
which
i
had
fallen
adoze
and
adream
no
it
was
a
big
ugly
antique
but
convenient
house
embodying
a
few
features
of
a
building
still
older
half-replaced
and
half-utilized
in
which
i
had
the
fancy
of
our
being
almost
as
lost
as
a
handful
of
passengers
in
a
great
drifting
ship
well
i
was
strangely
at
the
helm
ii
this
came
home
to
me
when
two
days
later
i
drove
over
with
flora
to
meet
as
mrs
grose
said
the
little
gentleman
and
all
the
more
for
an
incident
that
presenting
itself
the
second
evening
had
deeply
disconcerted
me
the
first
day
had
been
on
the
whole
as
i
have
expressed
reassuring
but
i
was
to
see
it
wind
up
in
keen
apprehension
the
postbag
that
eveningâ€”it
came
lateâ€”contained
a
letter
for
me
which
however
in
the
hand
of
my
employer
i
found
to
be
composed
but
of
a
few
words
enclosing
another
addressed
to
himself
with
a
seal
still
unbroken
â€œthis
i
recognize
is
from
the
headmaster
and
the
headmasterâ€™s
an
awful
bore
read
him
please
deal
with
him
but
mind
you
donâ€™t
report
not
a
word
iâ€™m
offâ€
i
broke
the
seal
with
a
great
effortâ€”so
great
a
one
that
i
was
a
long
time
coming
to
it
took
the
unopened
missive
at
last
up
to
my
room
and
only
attacked
it
just
before
going
to
bed
i
had
better
have
let
it
wait
till
morning
for
it
gave
me
a
second
sleepless
night
with
no
counsel
to
take
the
next
day
i
was
full
of
distress
and
it
finally
got
so
the
better
of
me
that
i
determined
to
open
myself
at
least
to
mrs
grose
â€œwhat
does
it
mean
the
childâ€™s
dismissed
his
schoolâ€
she
gave
me
a
look
that
i
remarked
at
the
moment
then
visibly
with
a
quick
blankness
seemed
to
try
to
take
it
back
â€œbut
arenâ€™t
they
allâ€”â€
â€œsent
homeâ€”yes
but
only
for
the
holidays
miles
may
never
go
back
at
allâ€
consciously
under
my
attention
she
reddened
â€œthey
wonâ€™t
take
himâ€
â€œthey
absolutely
declineâ€
at
this
she
raised
her
eyes
which
she
had
turned
from
me
i
saw
them
fill
with
good
tears
â€œwhat
has
he
doneâ€
i
hesitated
then
i
judged
best
simply
to
hand
her
my
letterâ€”which
however
had
the
effect
of
making
her
without
taking
it
simply
put
her
hands
behind
her
she
shook
her
head
sadly
â€œsuch
things
are
not
for
me
missâ€
my
counselor
couldnâ€™t
read
i
winced
at
my
mistake
which
i
attenuated
as
i
could
and
opened
my
letter
again
to
repeat
it
to
her
then
faltering
in
the
act
and
folding
it
up
once
more
i
put
it
back
in
my
pocket
â€œis
he
really
badâ€
the
tears
were
still
in
her
eyes
â€œdo
the
gentlemen
say
soâ€
â€œthey
go
into
no
particulars
they
simply
express
their
regret
that
it
should
be
impossible
to
keep
him
that
can
have
only
one
meaningâ€
mrs
grose
listened
with
dumb
emotion
she
forbore
to
ask
me
what
this
meaning
might
be
so
that
presently
to
put
the
thing
with
some
coherence
and
with
the
mere
aid
of
her
presence
to
my
own
mind
i
went
on
â€œthat
heâ€™s
an
injury
to
the
othersâ€
at
this
with
one
of
the
quick
turns
of
simple
folk
she
suddenly
flamed
up
â€œmaster
miles
him
an
injuryâ€
there
was
such
a
flood
of
good
faith
in
it
that
though
i
had
not
yet
seen
the
child
my
very
fears
made
me
jump
to
the
absurdity
of
the
idea
i
found
myself
to
meet
my
friend
the
better
offering
it
on
the
spot
sarcastically
â€œto
his
poor
little
innocent
matesâ€
â€œitâ€™s
too
dreadfulâ€
cried
mrs
grose
â€œto
say
such
cruel
things
why
heâ€™s
scarce
ten
years
oldâ€
â€œyes
yes
it
would
be
incredibleâ€
she
was
evidently
grateful
for
such
a
profession
â€œsee
him
miss
first
then
believe
itâ€
i
felt
forthwith
a
new
impatience
to
see
him
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
curiosity
that
for
all
the
next
hours
was
to
deepen
almost
to
pain
mrs
grose
was
aware
i
could
judge
of
what
she
had
produced
in
me
and
she
followed
it
up
with
assurance
â€œyou
might
as
well
believe
it
of
the
little
lady
bless
herâ€
she
added
the
next
momentâ€”â€œlook
at
herâ€
i
turned
and
saw
that
flora
whom
ten
minutes
before
i
had
established
in
the
schoolroom
with
a
sheet
of
white
paper
a
pencil
and
a
copy
of
nice
â€œround
oâ€™sâ€
now
presented
herself
to
view
at
the
open
door
she
expressed
in
her
little
way
an
extraordinary
detachment
from
disagreeable
duties
looking
to
me
however
with
a
great
childish
light
that
seemed
to
offer
it
as
a
mere
result
of
the
affection
she
had
conceived
for
my
person
which
had
rendered
necessary
that
she
should
follow
me
i
needed
nothing
more
than
this
to
feel
the
full
force
of
mrs
groseâ€™s
comparison
and
catching
my
pupil
in
my
arms
covered
her
with
kisses
in
which
there
was
a
sob
of
atonement
nonetheless
the
rest
of
the
day
i
watched
for
further
occasion
to
approach
my
colleague
especially
as
toward
evening
i
began
to
fancy
she
rather
sought
to
avoid
me
i
overtook
her
i
remember
on
the
staircase
we
went
down
together
and
at
the
bottom
i
detained
her
holding
her
there
with
a
hand
on
her
arm
â€œi
take
what
you
said
to
me
at
noon
as
a
declaration
that
youâ€™ve
never
known
him
to
be
badâ€
she
threw
back
her
head
she
had
clearly
by
this
time
and
very
honestly
adopted
an
attitude
â€œoh
never
known
himâ€”i
donâ€™t
pretend
thatâ€
i
was
upset
again
â€œthen
you
have
known
himâ€”â€
â€œyes
indeed
miss
thank
godâ€
on
reflection
i
accepted
this
â€œyou
mean
that
a
boy
who
never
isâ€”â€
â€œis
no
boy
for
meâ€
i
held
her
tighter
â€œyou
like
them
with
the
spirit
to
be
naughtyâ€
then
keeping
pace
with
her
answer
â€œso
do
iâ€
i
eagerly
brought
out
â€œbut
not
to
the
degree
to
contaminateâ€”â€
â€œto
contaminateâ€â€”my
big
word
left
her
at
a
loss
i
explained
it
â€œto
corruptâ€
she
stared
taking
my
meaning
in
but
it
produced
in
her
an
odd
laugh
â€œare
you
afraid
heâ€™ll
corrupt
youâ€
she
put
the
question
with
such
a
fine
bold
humor
that
with
a
laugh
a
little
silly
doubtless
to
match
her
own
i
gave
way
for
the
time
to
the
apprehension
of
ridicule
but
the
next
day
as
the
hour
for
my
drive
approached
i
cropped
up
in
another
place
â€œwhat
was
the
lady
who
was
here
beforeâ€
â€œthe
last
governess
she
was
also
young
and
prettyâ€”almost
as
young
and
almost
as
pretty
miss
even
as
youâ€
â€œah
then
i
hope
her
youth
and
her
beauty
helped
herâ€
i
recollect
throwing
off
â€œhe
seems
to
like
us
young
and
prettyâ€
â€œoh
he
didâ€
mrs
grose
assented
â€œit
was
the
way
he
liked
everyoneâ€
she
had
no
sooner
spoken
indeed
than
she
caught
herself
up
â€œi
mean
thatâ€™s
his
wayâ€”the
masterâ€™sâ€
i
was
struck
â€œbut
of
whom
did
you
speak
firstâ€
she
looked
blank
but
she
colored
â€œwhy
of
himâ€
â€œof
the
masterâ€
â€œof
who
elseâ€
there
was
so
obviously
no
one
else
that
the
next
moment
i
had
lost
my
impression
of
her
having
accidentally
said
more
than
she
meant
and
i
merely
asked
what
i
wanted
to
know
â€œdid
she
see
anything
in
the
boyâ€”â€
â€œthat
wasnâ€™t
right
she
never
told
meâ€
i
had
a
scruple
but
i
overcame
it
â€œwas
she
carefulâ€”particularâ€
mrs
grose
appeared
to
try
to
be
conscientious
â€œabout
some
thingsâ€”yesâ€
â€œbut
not
about
allâ€
again
she
considered
â€œwell
missâ€”sheâ€™s
gone
i
wonâ€™t
tell
talesâ€
â€œi
quite
understand
your
feelingâ€
i
hastened
to
reply
but
i
thought
it
after
an
instant
not
opposed
to
this
concession
to
pursue
â€œdid
she
die
hereâ€
â€œnoâ€”she
went
offâ€
i
donâ€™t
know
what
there
was
in
this
brevity
of
mrs
groseâ€™s
that
struck
me
as
ambiguous
â€œwent
off
to
dieâ€
mrs
grose
looked
straight
out
of
the
window
but
i
felt
that
hypothetically
i
had
a
right
to
know
what
young
persons
engaged
for
bly
were
expected
to
do
â€œshe
was
taken
ill
you
mean
and
went
homeâ€
â€œshe
was
not
taken
ill
so
far
as
appeared
in
this
house
she
left
it
at
the
end
of
the
year
to
go
home
as
she
said
for
a
short
holiday
to
which
the
time
she
had
put
in
had
certainly
given
her
a
right
we
had
then
a
young
womanâ€”a
nursemaid
who
had
stayed
on
and
who
was
a
good
girl
and
clever
and
she
took
the
children
altogether
for
the
interval
but
our
young
lady
never
came
back
and
at
the
very
moment
i
was
expecting
her
i
heard
from
the
master
that
she
was
deadâ€
i
turned
this
over
â€œbut
of
whatâ€
â€œhe
never
told
me
but
please
missâ€
said
mrs
grose
â€œi
must
get
to
my
workâ€
iii
her
thus
turning
her
back
on
me
was
fortunately
not
for
my
just
preoccupations
a
snub
that
could
check
the
growth
of
our
mutual
esteem
we
met
after
i
had
brought
home
little
miles
more
intimately
than
ever
on
the
ground
of
my
stupefaction
my
general
emotion
so
monstrous
was
i
then
ready
to
pronounce
it
that
such
a
child
as
had
now
been
revealed
to
me
should
be
under
an
interdict
i
was
a
little
late
on
the
scene
and
i
felt
as
he
stood
wistfully
looking
out
for
me
before
the
door
of
the
inn
at
which
the
coach
had
put
him
down
that
i
had
seen
him
on
the
instant
without
and
within
in
the
great
glow
of
freshness
the
same
positive
fragrance
of
purity
in
which
i
had
from
the
first
moment
seen
his
little
sister
he
was
incredibly
beautiful
and
mrs
grose
had
put
her
finger
on
it
everything
but
a
sort
of
passion
of
tenderness
for
him
was
swept
away
by
his
presence
what
i
then
and
there
took
him
to
my
heart
for
was
something
divine
that
i
have
never
found
to
the
same
degree
in
any
childâ€”his
indescribable
little
air
of
knowing
nothing
in
the
world
but
love
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
carry
a
bad
name
with
a
greater
sweetness
of
innocence
and
by
the
time
i
had
got
back
to
bly
with
him
i
remained
merely
bewilderedâ€”so
far
that
is
as
i
was
not
outragedâ€”by
the
sense
of
the
horrible
letter
locked
up
in
my
room
in
a
drawer
as
soon
as
i
could
compass
a
private
word
with
mrs
grose
i
declared
to
her
that
it
was
grotesque
she
promptly
understood
me
â€œyou
mean
the
cruel
chargeâ€”â€
â€œit
doesnâ€™t
live
an
instant
my
dear
woman
look
at
himâ€
she
smiled
at
my
pretention
to
have
discovered
his
charm
â€œi
assure
you
miss
i
do
nothing
else
what
will
you
say
thenâ€
she
immediately
added
â€œin
answer
to
the
letterâ€
i
had
made
up
my
mind
â€œnothingâ€
â€œand
to
his
uncleâ€
i
was
incisive
â€œnothingâ€
â€œand
to
the
boy
himselfâ€
i
was
wonderful
â€œnothingâ€
she
gave
with
her
apron
a
great
wipe
to
her
mouth
â€œthen
iâ€™ll
stand
by
you
weâ€™ll
see
it
outâ€
â€œweâ€™ll
see
it
outâ€
i
ardently
echoed
giving
her
my
hand
to
make
it
a
vow
she
held
me
there
a
moment
then
whisked
up
her
apron
again
with
her
detached
hand
â€œwould
you
mind
miss
if
i
used
the
freedomâ€”â€
â€œto
kiss
me
noâ€
i
took
the
good
creature
in
my
arms
and
after
we
had
embraced
like
sisters
felt
still
more
fortified
and
indignant
this
at
all
events
was
for
the
time
a
time
so
full
that
as
i
recall
the
way
it
went
it
reminds
me
of
all
the
art
i
now
need
to
make
it
a
little
distinct
what
i
look
back
at
with
amazement
is
the
situation
i
accepted
i
had
undertaken
with
my
companion
to
see
it
out
and
i
was
under
a
charm
apparently
that
could
smooth
away
the
extent
and
the
far
and
difficult
connections
of
such
an
effort
i
was
lifted
aloft
on
a
great
wave
of
infatuation
and
pity
i
found
it
simple
in
my
ignorance
my
confusion
and
perhaps
my
conceit
to
assume
that
i
could
deal
with
a
boy
whose
education
for
the
world
was
all
on
the
point
of
beginning
i
am
unable
even
to
remember
at
this
day
what
proposal
i
framed
for
the
end
of
his
holidays
and
the
resumption
of
his
studies
lessons
with
me
indeed
that
charming
summer
we
all
had
a
theory
that
he
was
to
have
but
i
now
feel
that
for
weeks
the
lessons
must
have
been
rather
my
own
i
learned
somethingâ€”at
first
certainlyâ€”that
had
not
been
one
of
the
teachings
of
my
small
smothered
life
learned
to
be
amused
and
even
amusing
and
not
to
think
for
the
morrow
it
was
the
first
time
in
a
manner
that
i
had
known
space
and
air
and
freedom
all
the
music
of
summer
and
all
the
mystery
of
nature
and
then
there
was
considerationâ€”and
consideration
was
sweet
oh
it
was
a
trapâ€”not
designed
but
deepâ€”to
my
imagination
to
my
delicacy
perhaps
to
my
vanity
to
whatever
in
me
was
most
excitable
the
best
way
to
picture
it
all
is
to
say
that
i
was
off
my
guard
they
gave
me
so
little
troubleâ€”they
were
of
a
gentleness
so
extraordinary
i
used
to
speculateâ€”but
even
this
with
a
dim
disconnectednessâ€”as
to
how
the
rough
future
for
all
futures
are
rough
would
handle
them
and
might
bruise
them
they
had
the
bloom
of
health
and
happiness
and
yet
as
if
i
had
been
in
charge
of
a
pair
of
little
grandees
of
princes
of
the
blood
for
whom
everything
to
be
right
would
have
to
be
enclosed
and
protected
the
only
form
that
in
my
fancy
the
afteryears
could
take
for
them
was
that
of
a
romantic
a
really
royal
extension
of
the
garden
and
the
park
it
may
be
of
course
above
all
that
what
suddenly
broke
into
this
gives
the
previous
time
a
charm
of
stillnessâ€”that
hush
in
which
something
gathers
or
crouches
the
change
was
actually
like
the
spring
of
a
beast
in
the
first
weeks
the
days
were
long
they
often
at
their
finest
gave
me
what
i
used
to
call
my
own
hour
the
hour
when
for
my
pupils
teatime
and
bedtime
having
come
and
gone
i
had
before
my
final
retirement
a
small
interval
alone
much
as
i
liked
my
companions
this
hour
was
the
thing
in
the
day
i
liked
most
and
i
liked
it
best
of
all
when
as
the
light
fadedâ€”or
rather
i
should
say
the
day
lingered
and
the
last
calls
of
the
last
birds
sounded
in
a
flushed
sky
from
the
old
treesâ€”i
could
take
a
turn
into
the
grounds
and
enjoy
almost
with
a
sense
of
property
that
amused
and
flattered
me
the
beauty
and
dignity
of
the
place
it
was
a
pleasure
at
these
moments
to
feel
myself
tranquil
and
justified
doubtless
perhaps
also
to
reflect
that
by
my
discretion
my
quiet
good
sense
and
general
high
propriety
i
was
giving
pleasureâ€”if
he
ever
thought
of
itâ€”to
the
person
to
whose
pressure
i
had
responded
what
i
was
doing
was
what
he
had
earnestly
hoped
and
directly
asked
of
me
and
that
i
could
after
all
do
it
proved
even
a
greater
joy
than
i
had
expected
i
daresay
i
fancied
myself
in
short
a
remarkable
young
woman
and
took
comfort
in
the
faith
that
this
would
more
publicly
appear
well
i
needed
to
be
remarkable
to
offer
a
front
to
the
remarkable
things
that
presently
gave
their
first
sign
it
was
plump
one
afternoon
in
the
middle
of
my
very
hour
the
children
were
tucked
away
and
i
had
come
out
for
my
stroll
one
of
the
thoughts
that
as
i
donâ€™t
in
the
least
shrink
now
from
noting
used
to
be
with
me
in
these
wanderings
was
that
it
would
be
as
charming
as
a
charming
story
suddenly
to
meet
someone
someone
would
appear
there
at
the
turn
of
a
path
and
would
stand
before
me
and
smile
and
approve
i
didnâ€™t
ask
more
than
thatâ€”i
only
asked
that
he
should
know
and
the
only
way
to
be
sure
he
knew
would
be
to
see
it
and
the
kind
light
of
it
in
his
handsome
face
that
was
exactly
present
to
meâ€”by
which
i
mean
the
face
wasâ€”when
on
the
first
of
these
occasions
at
the
end
of
a
long
june
day
i
stopped
short
on
emerging
from
one
of
the
plantations
and
coming
into
view
of
the
house
what
arrested
me
on
the
spotâ€”and
with
a
shock
much
greater
than
any
vision
had
allowed
forâ€”was
the
sense
that
my
imagination
had
in
a
flash
turned
real
he
did
stand
thereâ€”but
high
up
beyond
the
lawn
and
at
the
very
top
of
the
tower
to
which
on
that
first
morning
little
flora
had
conducted
me
this
tower
was
one
of
a
pairâ€”square
incongruous
crenelated
structuresâ€”that
were
distinguished
for
some
reason
though
i
could
see
little
difference
as
the
new
and
the
old
they
flanked
opposite
ends
of
the
house
and
were
probably
architectural
absurdities
redeemed
in
a
measure
indeed
by
not
being
wholly
disengaged
nor
of
a
height
too
pretentious
dating
in
their
gingerbread
antiquity
from
a
romantic
revival
that
was
already
a
respectable
past
i
admired
them
had
fancies
about
them
for
we
could
all
profit
in
a
degree
especially
when
they
loomed
through
the
dusk
by
the
grandeur
of
their
actual
battlements
yet
it
was
not
at
such
an
elevation
that
the
figure
i
had
so
often
invoked
seemed
most
in
place
it
produced
in
me
this
figure
in
the
clear
twilight
i
remember
two
distinct
gasps
of
emotion
which
were
sharply
the
shock
of
my
first
and
that
of
my
second
surprise
my
second
was
a
violent
perception
of
the
mistake
of
my
first
the
man
who
met
my
eyes
was
not
the
person
i
had
precipitately
supposed
there
came
to
me
thus
a
bewilderment
of
vision
of
which
after
these
years
there
is
no
living
view
that
i
can
hope
to
give
an
unknown
man
in
a
lonely
place
is
a
permitted
object
of
fear
to
a
young
woman
privately
bred
and
the
figure
that
faced
me
wasâ€”a
few
more
seconds
assured
meâ€”as
little
anyone
else
i
knew
as
it
was
the
image
that
had
been
in
my
mind
i
had
not
seen
it
in
harley
streetâ€”i
had
not
seen
it
anywhere
the
place
moreover
in
the
strangest
way
in
the
world
had
on
the
instant
and
by
the
very
fact
of
its
appearance
become
a
solitude
to
me
at
least
making
my
statement
here
with
a
deliberation
with
which
i
have
never
made
it
the
whole
feeling
of
the
moment
returns
it
was
as
if
while
i
took
inâ€”what
i
did
take
inâ€”all
the
rest
of
the
scene
had
been
stricken
with
death
i
can
hear
again
as
i
write
the
intense
hush
in
which
the
sounds
of
evening
dropped
the
rooks
stopped
cawing
in
the
golden
sky
and
the
friendly
hour
lost
for
the
minute
all
its
voice
but
there
was
no
other
change
in
nature
unless
indeed
it
were
a
change
that
i
saw
with
a
stranger
sharpness
the
gold
was
still
in
the
sky
the
clearness
in
the
air
and
the
man
who
looked
at
me
over
the
battlements
was
as
definite
as
a
picture
in
a
frame
thatâ€™s
how
i
thought
with
extraordinary
quickness
of
each
person
that
he
might
have
been
and
that
he
was
not
we
were
confronted
across
our
distance
quite
long
enough
for
me
to
ask
myself
with
intensity
who
then
he
was
and
to
feel
as
an
effect
of
my
inability
to
say
a
wonder
that
in
a
few
instants
more
became
intense
the
great
question
or
one
of
these
is
afterward
i
know
with
regard
to
certain
matters
the
question
of
how
long
they
have
lasted
well
this
matter
of
mine
think
what
you
will
of
it
lasted
while
i
caught
at
a
dozen
possibilities
none
of
which
made
a
difference
for
the
better
that
i
could
see
in
there
having
been
in
the
houseâ€”and
for
how
long
above
allâ€”a
person
of
whom
i
was
in
ignorance
it
lasted
while
i
just
bridled
a
little
with
the
sense
that
my
office
demanded
that
there
should
be
no
such
ignorance
and
no
such
person
it
lasted
while
this
visitant
at
all
eventsâ€”and
there
was
a
touch
of
the
strange
freedom
as
i
remember
in
the
sign
of
familiarity
of
his
wearing
no
hatâ€”seemed
to
fix
me
from
his
position
with
just
the
question
just
the
scrutiny
through
the
fading
light
that
his
own
presence
provoked
we
were
too
far
apart
to
call
to
each
other
but
there
was
a
moment
at
which
at
shorter
range
some
challenge
between
us
breaking
the
hush
would
have
been
the
right
result
of
our
straight
mutual
stare
he
was
in
one
of
the
angles
the
one
away
from
the
house
very
erect
as
it
struck
me
and
with
both
hands
on
the
ledge
so
i
saw
him
as
i
see
the
letters
i
form
on
this
page
then
exactly
after
a
minute
as
if
to
add
to
the
spectacle
he
slowly
changed
his
placeâ€”passed
looking
at
me
hard
all
the
while
to
the
opposite
corner
of
the
platform
yes
i
had
the
sharpest
sense
that
during
this
transit
he
never
took
his
eyes
from
me
and
i
can
see
at
this
moment
the
way
his
hand
as
he
went
passed
from
one
of
the
crenelations
to
the
next
he
stopped
at
the
other
corner
but
less
long
and
even
as
he
turned
away
still
markedly
fixed
me
he
turned
away
that
was
all
i
knew
iv
it
was
not
that
i
didnâ€™t
wait
on
this
occasion
for
more
for
i
was
rooted
as
deeply
as
i
was
shaken
was
there
a
â€œsecretâ€
at
blyâ€”a
mystery
of
udolpho
or
an
insane
an
unmentionable
relative
kept
in
unsuspected
confinement
i
canâ€™t
say
how
long
i
turned
it
over
or
how
long
in
a
confusion
of
curiosity
and
dread
i
remained
where
i
had
had
my
collision
i
only
recall
that
when
i
re-entered
the
house
darkness
had
quite
closed
in
agitation
in
the
interval
certainly
had
held
me
and
driven
me
for
i
must
in
circling
about
the
place
have
walked
three
miles
but
i
was
to
be
later
on
so
much
more
overwhelmed
that
this
mere
dawn
of
alarm
was
a
comparatively
human
chill
the
most
singular
part
of
it
in
factâ€”singular
as
the
rest
had
beenâ€”was
the
part
i
became
in
the
hall
aware
of
in
meeting
mrs
grose
this
picture
comes
back
to
me
in
the
general
trainâ€”the
impression
as
i
received
it
on
my
return
of
the
wide
white
panelled
space
bright
in
the
lamplight
and
with
its
portraits
and
red
carpet
and
of
the
good
surprised
look
of
my
friend
which
immediately
told
me
she
had
missed
me
it
came
to
me
straightway
under
her
contact
that
with
plain
heartiness
mere
relieved
anxiety
at
my
appearance
she
knew
nothing
whatever
that
could
bear
upon
the
incident
i
had
there
ready
for
her
i
had
not
suspected
in
advance
that
her
comfortable
face
would
pull
me
up
and
i
somehow
measured
the
importance
of
what
i
had
seen
by
my
thus
finding
myself
hesitate
to
mention
it
scarce
anything
in
the
whole
history
seems
to
me
so
odd
as
this
fact
that
my
real
beginning
of
fear
was
one
as
i
may
say
with
the
instinct
of
sparing
my
companion
on
the
spot
accordingly
in
the
pleasant
hall
and
with
her
eyes
on
me
i
for
a
reason
that
i
couldnâ€™t
then
have
phrased
achieved
an
inward
resolutionâ€”offered
a
vague
pretext
for
my
lateness
and
with
the
plea
of
the
beauty
of
the
night
and
of
the
heavy
dew
and
wet
feet
went
as
soon
as
possible
to
my
room
here
it
was
another
affair
here
for
many
days
after
it
was
a
queer
affair
enough
there
were
hours
from
day
to
dayâ€”or
at
least
there
were
moments
snatched
even
from
clear
dutiesâ€”when
i
had
to
shut
myself
up
to
think
it
was
not
so
much
yet
that
i
was
more
nervous
than
i
could
bear
to
be
as
that
i
was
remarkably
afraid
of
becoming
so
for
the
truth
i
had
now
to
turn
over
was
simply
and
clearly
the
truth
that
i
could
arrive
at
no
account
whatever
of
the
visitor
with
whom
i
had
been
so
inexplicably
and
yet
as
it
seemed
to
me
so
intimately
concerned
it
took
little
time
to
see
that
i
could
sound
without
forms
of
inquiry
and
without
exciting
remark
any
domestic
complications
the
shock
i
had
suffered
must
have
sharpened
all
my
senses
i
felt
sure
at
the
end
of
three
days
and
as
the
result
of
mere
closer
attention
that
i
had
not
been
practiced
upon
by
the
servants
nor
made
the
object
of
any
â€œgameâ€
of
whatever
it
was
that
i
knew
nothing
was
known
around
me
there
was
but
one
sane
inference
someone
had
taken
a
liberty
rather
gross
that
was
what
repeatedly
i
dipped
into
my
room
and
locked
the
door
to
say
to
myself
we
had
been
collectively
subject
to
an
intrusion
some
unscrupulous
traveler
curious
in
old
houses
had
made
his
way
in
unobserved
enjoyed
the
prospect
from
the
best
point
of
view
and
then
stolen
out
as
he
came
if
he
had
given
me
such
a
bold
hard
stare
that
was
but
a
part
of
his
indiscretion
the
good
thing
after
all
was
that
we
should
surely
see
no
more
of
him
this
was
not
so
good
a
thing
i
admit
as
not
to
leave
me
to
judge
that
what
essentially
made
nothing
else
much
signify
was
simply
my
charming
work
my
charming
work
was
just
my
life
with
miles
and
flora
and
through
nothing
could
i
so
like
it
as
through
feeling
that
i
could
throw
myself
into
it
in
trouble
the
attraction
of
my
small
charges
was
a
constant
joy
leading
me
to
wonder
afresh
at
the
vanity
of
my
original
fears
the
distaste
i
had
begun
by
entertaining
for
the
probable
gray
prose
of
my
office
there
was
to
be
no
gray
prose
it
appeared
and
no
long
grind
so
how
could
work
not
be
charming
that
presented
itself
as
daily
beauty
it
was
all
the
romance
of
the
nursery
and
the
poetry
of
the
schoolroom
i
donâ€™t
mean
by
this
of
course
that
we
studied
only
fiction
and
verse
i
mean
i
can
express
no
otherwise
the
sort
of
interest
my
companions
inspired
how
can
i
describe
that
except
by
saying
that
instead
of
growing
used
to
themâ€”and
itâ€™s
a
marvel
for
a
governess
i
call
the
sisterhood
to
witnessâ€”i
made
constant
fresh
discoveries
there
was
one
direction
assuredly
in
which
these
discoveries
stopped
deep
obscurity
continued
to
cover
the
region
of
the
boyâ€™s
conduct
at
school
it
had
been
promptly
given
me
i
have
noted
to
face
that
mystery
without
a
pang
perhaps
even
it
would
be
nearer
the
truth
to
say
thatâ€”without
a
wordâ€”he
himself
had
cleared
it
up
he
had
made
the
whole
charge
absurd
my
conclusion
bloomed
there
with
the
real
rose
flush
of
his
innocence
he
was
only
too
fine
and
fair
for
the
little
horrid
unclean
school-world
and
he
had
paid
a
price
for
it
i
reflected
acutely
that
the
sense
of
such
differences
such
superiorities
of
quality
always
on
the
part
of
the
majorityâ€”which
could
include
even
stupid
sordid
headmastersâ€”turn
infallibly
to
the
vindictive
both
the
children
had
a
gentleness
it
was
their
only
fault
and
it
never
made
miles
a
muff
that
kept
themâ€”how
shall
i
express
itâ€”almost
impersonal
and
certainly
quite
unpunishable
they
were
like
the
cherubs
of
the
anecdote
who
hadâ€”morally
at
any
rateâ€”nothing
to
whack
i
remember
feeling
with
miles
in
especial
as
if
he
had
had
as
it
were
no
history
we
expect
of
a
small
child
a
scant
one
but
there
was
in
this
beautiful
little
boy
something
extraordinarily
sensitive
yet
extraordinarily
happy
that
more
than
in
any
creature
of
his
age
i
have
seen
struck
me
as
beginning
anew
each
day
he
had
never
for
a
second
suffered
i
took
this
as
a
direct
disproof
of
his
having
really
been
chastised
if
he
had
been
wicked
he
would
have
â€œcaughtâ€
it
and
i
should
have
caught
it
by
the
reboundâ€”i
should
have
found
the
trace
i
found
nothing
at
all
and
he
was
therefore
an
angel
he
never
spoke
of
his
school
never
mentioned
a
comrade
or
a
master
and
i
for
my
part
was
quite
too
much
disgusted
to
allude
to
them
of
course
i
was
under
the
spell
and
the
wonderful
part
is
that
even
at
the
time
i
perfectly
knew
i
was
but
i
gave
myself
up
to
it
it
was
an
antidote
to
any
pain
and
i
had
more
pains
than
one
i
was
in
receipt
in
these
days
of
disturbing
letters
from
home
where
things
were
not
going
well
but
with
my
children
what
things
in
the
world
mattered
that
was
the
question
i
used
to
put
to
my
scrappy
retirements
i
was
dazzled
by
their
loveliness
there
was
a
sundayâ€”to
get
onâ€”when
it
rained
with
such
force
and
for
so
many
hours
that
there
could
be
no
procession
to
church
in
consequence
of
which
as
the
day
declined
i
had
arranged
with
mrs
grose
that
should
the
evening
show
improvement
we
would
attend
together
the
late
service
the
rain
happily
stopped
and
i
prepared
for
our
walk
which
through
the
park
and
by
the
good
road
to
the
village
would
be
a
matter
of
twenty
minutes
coming
downstairs
to
meet
my
colleague
in
the
hall
i
remembered
a
pair
of
gloves
that
had
required
three
stitches
and
that
had
received
themâ€”with
a
publicity
perhaps
not
edifyingâ€”while
i
sat
with
the
children
at
their
tea
served
on
sundays
by
exception
in
that
cold
clean
temple
of
mahogany
and
brass
the
â€œgrown-upâ€
dining
room
the
gloves
had
been
dropped
there
and
i
turned
in
to
recover
them
the
day
was
gray
enough
but
the
afternoon
light
still
lingered
and
it
enabled
me
on
crossing
the
threshold
not
only
to
recognize
on
a
chair
near
the
wide
window
then
closed
the
articles
i
wanted
but
to
become
aware
of
a
person
on
the
other
side
of
the
window
and
looking
straight
in
one
step
into
the
room
had
sufficed
my
vision
was
instantaneous
it
was
all
there
the
person
looking
straight
in
was
the
person
who
had
already
appeared
to
me
he
appeared
thus
again
with
i
wonâ€™t
say
greater
distinctness
for
that
was
impossible
but
with
a
nearness
that
represented
a
forward
stride
in
our
intercourse
and
made
me
as
i
met
him
catch
my
breath
and
turn
cold
he
was
the
sameâ€”he
was
the
same
and
seen
this
time
as
he
had
been
seen
before
from
the
waist
up
the
window
though
the
dining
room
was
on
the
ground
floor
not
going
down
to
the
terrace
on
which
he
stood
his
face
was
close
to
the
glass
yet
the
effect
of
this
better
view
was
strangely
only
to
show
me
how
intense
the
former
had
been
he
remained
but
a
few
secondsâ€”long
enough
to
convince
me
he
also
saw
and
recognized
but
it
was
as
if
i
had
been
looking
at
him
for
years
and
had
known
him
always
something
however
happened
this
time
that
had
not
happened
before
his
stare
into
my
face
through
the
glass
and
across
the
room
was
as
deep
and
hard
as
then
but
it
quitted
me
for
a
moment
during
which
i
could
still
watch
it
see
it
fix
successively
several
other
things
on
the
spot
there
came
to
me
the
added
shock
of
a
certitude
that
it
was
not
for
me
he
had
come
there
he
had
come
for
someone
else
the
flash
of
this
knowledgeâ€”for
it
was
knowledge
in
the
midst
of
dreadâ€”produced
in
me
the
most
extraordinary
effect
started
as
i
stood
there
a
sudden
vibration
of
duty
and
courage
i
say
courage
because
i
was
beyond
all
doubt
already
far
gone
i
bounded
straight
out
of
the
door
again
reached
that
of
the
house
got
in
an
instant
upon
the
drive
and
passing
along
the
terrace
as
fast
as
i
could
rush
turned
a
corner
and
came
full
in
sight
but
it
was
in
sight
of
nothing
nowâ€”my
visitor
had
vanished
i
stopped
i
almost
dropped
with
the
real
relief
of
this
but
i
took
in
the
whole
sceneâ€”i
gave
him
time
to
reappear
i
call
it
time
but
how
long
was
it
i
canâ€™t
speak
to
the
purpose
today
of
the
duration
of
these
things
that
kind
of
measure
must
have
left
me
they
couldnâ€™t
have
lasted
as
they
actually
appeared
to
me
to
last
the
terrace
and
the
whole
place
the
lawn
and
the
garden
beyond
it
all
i
could
see
of
the
park
were
empty
with
a
great
emptiness
there
were
shrubberies
and
big
trees
but
i
remember
the
clear
assurance
i
felt
that
none
of
them
concealed
him
he
was
there
or
was
not
there
not
there
if
i
didnâ€™t
see
him
i
got
hold
of
this
then
instinctively
instead
of
returning
as
i
had
come
went
to
the
window
it
was
confusedly
present
to
me
that
i
ought
to
place
myself
where
he
had
stood
i
did
so
i
applied
my
face
to
the
pane
and
looked
as
he
had
looked
into
the
room
as
if
at
this
moment
to
show
me
exactly
what
his
range
had
been
mrs
grose
as
i
had
done
for
himself
just
before
came
in
from
the
hall
with
this
i
had
the
full
image
of
a
repetition
of
what
had
already
occurred
she
saw
me
as
i
had
seen
my
own
visitant
she
pulled
up
short
as
i
had
done
i
gave
her
something
of
the
shock
that
i
had
received
she
turned
white
and
this
made
me
ask
myself
if
i
had
blanched
as
much
she
stared
in
short
and
retreated
on
just
my
lines
and
i
knew
she
had
then
passed
out
and
come
round
to
me
and
that
i
should
presently
meet
her
i
remained
where
i
was
and
while
i
waited
i
thought
of
more
things
than
one
but
thereâ€™s
only
one
i
take
space
to
mention
i
wondered
why
she
should
be
scared
v
oh
she
let
me
know
as
soon
as
round
the
corner
of
the
house
she
loomed
again
into
view
â€œwhat
in
the
name
of
goodness
is
the
matterâ€”â€
she
was
now
flushed
and
out
of
breath
i
said
nothing
till
she
came
quite
near
â€œwith
meâ€
i
must
have
made
a
wonderful
face
â€œdo
i
show
itâ€
â€œyouâ€™re
as
white
as
a
sheet
you
look
awfulâ€
i
considered
i
could
meet
on
this
without
scruple
any
innocence
my
need
to
respect
the
bloom
of
mrs
groseâ€™s
had
dropped
without
a
rustle
from
my
shoulders
and
if
i
wavered
for
the
instant
it
was
not
with
what
i
kept
back
i
put
out
my
hand
to
her
and
she
took
it
i
held
her
hard
a
little
liking
to
feel
her
close
to
me
there
was
a
kind
of
support
in
the
shy
heave
of
her
surprise
â€œyou
came
for
me
for
church
of
course
but
i
canâ€™t
goâ€
â€œhas
anything
happenedâ€
â€œyes
you
must
know
now
did
i
look
very
queerâ€
â€œthrough
this
window
dreadfulâ€
â€œwellâ€
i
said
â€œiâ€™ve
been
frightenedâ€
mrs
groseâ€™s
eyes
expressed
plainly
that
she
had
no
wish
to
be
yet
also
that
she
knew
too
well
her
place
not
to
be
ready
to
share
with
me
any
marked
inconvenience
oh
it
was
quite
settled
that
she
must
share
â€œjust
what
you
saw
from
the
dining
room
a
minute
ago
was
the
effect
of
that
what
i
sawâ€”just
beforeâ€”was
much
worseâ€
her
hand
tightened
â€œwhat
was
itâ€
â€œan
extraordinary
man
looking
inâ€
â€œwhat
extraordinary
manâ€
â€œi
havenâ€™t
the
least
ideaâ€
mrs
grose
gazed
round
us
in
vain
â€œthen
where
is
he
goneâ€
â€œi
know
still
lessâ€
â€œhave
you
seen
him
beforeâ€
â€œyesâ€”once
on
the
old
towerâ€
she
could
only
look
at
me
harder
â€œdo
you
mean
heâ€™s
a
strangerâ€
â€œoh
very
muchâ€
â€œyet
you
didnâ€™t
tell
meâ€
â€œnoâ€”for
reasons
but
now
that
youâ€™ve
guessedâ€”â€
mrs
groseâ€™s
round
eyes
encountered
this
charge
â€œah
i
havenâ€™t
guessedâ€
she
said
very
simply
â€œhow
can
i
if
you
donâ€™t
imagineâ€
â€œi
donâ€™t
in
the
very
leastâ€
â€œyouâ€™ve
seen
him
nowhere
but
on
the
towerâ€
â€œand
on
this
spot
just
nowâ€
mrs
grose
looked
round
again
â€œwhat
was
he
doing
on
the
towerâ€
â€œonly
standing
there
and
looking
down
at
meâ€
she
thought
a
minute
â€œwas
he
a
gentlemanâ€
i
found
i
had
no
need
to
think
â€œnoâ€
she
gazed
in
deeper
wonder
â€œnoâ€
â€œthen
nobody
about
the
place
nobody
from
the
villageâ€
â€œnobodyâ€”nobody
i
didnâ€™t
tell
you
but
i
made
sureâ€
she
breathed
a
vague
relief
this
was
oddly
so
much
to
the
good
it
only
went
indeed
a
little
way
â€œbut
if
he
isnâ€™t
a
gentlemanâ€”â€
â€œwhat
is
he
heâ€™s
a
horrorâ€
â€œa
horrorâ€
â€œheâ€™sâ€”god
help
me
if
i
know
what
he
isâ€
mrs
grose
looked
round
once
more
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
duskier
distance
then
pulling
herself
together
turned
to
me
with
abrupt
inconsequence
â€œitâ€™s
time
we
should
be
at
churchâ€
â€œoh
iâ€™m
not
fit
for
churchâ€
â€œwonâ€™t
it
do
you
goodâ€
â€œit
wonâ€™t
do
themâ€”
i
nodded
at
the
house
â€œthe
childrenâ€
â€œi
canâ€™t
leave
them
nowâ€
â€œyouâ€™re
afraidâ€”â€
i
spoke
boldly
â€œiâ€™m
afraid
of
himâ€
mrs
groseâ€™s
large
face
showed
me
at
this
for
the
first
time
the
faraway
faint
glimmer
of
a
consciousness
more
acute
i
somehow
made
out
in
it
the
delayed
dawn
of
an
idea
i
myself
had
not
given
her
and
that
was
as
yet
quite
obscure
to
me
it
comes
back
to
me
that
i
thought
instantly
of
this
as
something
i
could
get
from
her
and
i
felt
it
to
be
connected
with
the
desire
she
presently
showed
to
know
more
â€œwhen
was
itâ€”on
the
towerâ€
â€œabout
the
middle
of
the
month
at
this
same
hourâ€
â€œalmost
at
darkâ€
said
mrs
grose
â€œoh
no
not
nearly
i
saw
him
as
i
see
youâ€
â€œthen
how
did
he
get
inâ€
â€œand
how
did
he
get
outâ€
i
laughed
â€œi
had
no
opportunity
to
ask
him
this
evening
you
seeâ€
i
pursued
â€œhe
has
not
been
able
to
get
inâ€
â€œhe
only
peepsâ€
â€œi
hope
it
will
be
confined
to
thatâ€
she
had
now
let
go
my
hand
she
turned
away
a
little
i
waited
an
instant
then
i
brought
out
â€œgo
to
church
goodbye
i
must
watchâ€
slowly
she
faced
me
again
â€œdo
you
fear
for
themâ€
we
met
in
another
long
look
â€œdonâ€™t
youâ€
instead
of
answering
she
came
nearer
to
the
window
and
for
a
minute
applied
her
face
to
the
glass
â€œyou
see
how
he
could
seeâ€
i
meanwhile
went
on
she
didnâ€™t
move
â€œhow
long
was
he
hereâ€
â€œtill
i
came
out
i
came
to
meet
himâ€
mrs
grose
at
last
turned
round
and
there
was
still
more
in
her
face
â€œi
couldnâ€™t
have
come
outâ€
â€œneither
could
iâ€
i
laughed
again
â€œbut
i
did
come
i
have
my
dutyâ€
â€œso
have
i
mineâ€
she
replied
after
which
she
added
â€œwhat
is
he
likeâ€
â€œiâ€™ve
been
dying
to
tell
you
but
heâ€™s
like
nobodyâ€
â€œnobodyâ€
she
echoed
â€œhe
has
no
hatâ€
then
seeing
in
her
face
that
she
already
in
this
with
a
deeper
dismay
found
a
touch
of
picture
i
quickly
added
stroke
to
stroke
â€œhe
has
red
hair
very
red
close-curling
and
a
pale
face
long
in
shape
with
straight
good
features
and
little
rather
queer
whiskers
that
are
as
red
as
his
hair
his
eyebrows
are
somehow
darker
they
look
particularly
arched
and
as
if
they
might
move
a
good
deal
his
eyes
are
sharp
strangeâ€”awfully
but
i
only
know
clearly
that
theyâ€™re
rather
small
and
very
fixed
his
mouthâ€™s
wide
and
his
lips
are
thin
and
except
for
his
little
whiskers
heâ€™s
quite
clean-shaven
he
gives
me
a
sort
of
sense
of
looking
like
an
actorâ€
â€œan
actorâ€
it
was
impossible
to
resemble
one
less
at
least
than
mrs
grose
at
that
moment
â€œiâ€™ve
never
seen
one
but
so
i
suppose
them
heâ€™s
tall
active
erectâ€
i
continued
â€œbut
neverâ€”no
neverâ€”a
gentlemanâ€
my
companionâ€™s
face
had
blanched
as
i
went
on
her
round
eyes
started
and
her
mild
mouth
gaped
â€œa
gentlemanâ€
she
gasped
confounded
stupefied
â€œa
gentleman
heâ€
â€œyou
know
him
thenâ€
she
visibly
tried
to
hold
herself
â€œbut
he
is
handsomeâ€
i
saw
the
way
to
help
her
â€œremarkablyâ€
â€œand
dressedâ€”â€
â€œin
somebodyâ€™s
clothesâ€
â€œtheyâ€™re
smart
but
theyâ€™re
not
his
ownâ€
she
broke
into
a
breathless
affirmative
groan
â€œtheyâ€™re
the
masterâ€™sâ€
i
caught
it
up
â€œyou
do
know
himâ€
she
faltered
but
a
second
â€œquintâ€
she
cried
â€œquintâ€
â€œpeter
quintâ€”his
own
man
his
valet
when
he
was
hereâ€
â€œwhen
the
master
wasâ€
gaping
still
but
meeting
me
she
pieced
it
all
together
â€œhe
never
wore
his
hat
but
he
did
wearâ€”well
there
were
waistcoats
missed
they
were
both
hereâ€”last
year
then
the
master
went
and
quint
was
aloneâ€
i
followed
but
halting
a
little
â€œaloneâ€
â€œalone
with
usâ€
then
as
from
a
deeper
depth
â€œin
chargeâ€
she
added
â€œand
what
became
of
himâ€
she
hung
fire
so
long
that
i
was
still
more
mystified
â€œhe
went
tooâ€
she
brought
out
at
last
â€œwent
whereâ€
her
expression
at
this
became
extraordinary
â€œgod
knows
where
he
diedâ€
â€œdiedâ€
i
almost
shrieked
she
seemed
fairly
to
square
herself
plant
herself
more
firmly
to
utter
the
wonder
of
it
â€œyes
mr
quint
is
deadâ€
vi
it
took
of
course
more
than
that
particular
passage
to
place
us
together
in
presence
of
what
we
had
now
to
live
with
as
we
couldâ€”my
dreadful
liability
to
impressions
of
the
order
so
vividly
exemplified
and
my
companionâ€™s
knowledge
henceforthâ€”a
knowledge
half
consternation
and
half
compassionâ€”of
that
liability
there
had
been
this
evening
after
the
revelation
left
me
for
an
hour
so
prostrateâ€”there
had
been
for
either
of
us
no
attendance
on
any
service
but
a
little
service
of
tears
and
vows
of
prayers
and
promises
a
climax
to
the
series
of
mutual
challenges
and
pledges
that
had
straightway
ensued
on
our
retreating
together
to
the
schoolroom
and
shutting
ourselves
up
there
to
have
everything
out
the
result
of
our
having
everything
out
was
simply
to
reduce
our
situation
to
the
last
rigor
of
its
elements
she
herself
had
seen
nothing
not
the
shadow
of
a
shadow
and
nobody
in
the
house
but
the
governess
was
in
the
governessâ€™s
plight
yet
she
accepted
without
directly
impugning
my
sanity
the
truth
as
i
gave
it
to
her
and
ended
by
showing
me
on
this
ground
an
awestricken
tenderness
an
expression
of
the
sense
of
my
more
than
questionable
privilege
of
which
the
very
breath
has
remained
with
me
as
that
of
the
sweetest
of
human
charities
what
was
settled
between
us
accordingly
that
night
was
that
we
thought
we
might
bear
things
together
and
i
was
not
even
sure
that
in
spite
of
her
exemption
it
was
she
who
had
the
best
of
the
burden
i
knew
at
this
hour
i
think
as
well
as
i
knew
later
what
i
was
capable
of
meeting
to
shelter
my
pupils
but
it
took
me
some
time
to
be
wholly
sure
of
what
my
honest
ally
was
prepared
for
to
keep
terms
with
so
compromising
a
contract
i
was
queer
company
enoughâ€”quite
as
queer
as
the
company
i
received
but
as
i
trace
over
what
we
went
through
i
see
how
much
common
ground
we
must
have
found
in
the
one
idea
that
by
good
fortune
could
steady
us
it
was
the
idea
the
second
movement
that
led
me
straight
out
as
i
may
say
of
the
inner
chamber
of
my
dread
i
could
take
the
air
in
the
court
at
least
and
there
mrs
grose
could
join
me
perfectly
can
i
recall
now
the
particular
way
strength
came
to
me
before
we
separated
for
the
night
we
had
gone
over
and
over
every
feature
of
what
i
had
seen
â€œhe
was
looking
for
someone
else
you
sayâ€”someone
who
was
not
youâ€
â€œhe
was
looking
for
little
milesâ€
a
portentous
clearness
now
possessed
me
â€œthatâ€™s
whom
he
was
looking
forâ€
â€œbut
how
do
you
knowâ€
â€œi
know
i
know
i
knowâ€
my
exaltation
grew
â€œand
you
know
my
dearâ€
she
didnâ€™t
deny
this
but
i
required
i
felt
not
even
so
much
telling
as
that
she
resumed
in
a
moment
at
any
rate
â€œwhat
if
he
should
see
himâ€
â€œlittle
miles
thatâ€™s
what
he
wantsâ€
she
looked
immensely
scared
again
â€œthe
childâ€
â€œheaven
forbid
the
man
he
wants
to
appear
to
themâ€
that
he
might
was
an
awful
conception
and
yet
somehow
i
could
keep
it
at
bay
which
moreover
as
we
lingered
there
was
what
i
succeeded
in
practically
proving
i
had
an
absolute
certainty
that
i
should
see
again
what
i
had
already
seen
but
something
within
me
said
that
by
offering
myself
bravely
as
the
sole
subject
of
such
experience
by
accepting
by
inviting
by
surmounting
it
all
i
should
serve
as
an
expiatory
victim
and
guard
the
tranquility
of
my
companions
the
children
in
especial
i
should
thus
fence
about
and
absolutely
save
i
recall
one
of
the
last
things
i
said
that
night
to
mrs
grose
â€œit
does
strike
me
that
my
pupils
have
never
mentionedâ€”â€
she
looked
at
me
hard
as
i
musingly
pulled
up
â€œhis
having
been
here
and
the
time
they
were
with
himâ€
â€œthe
time
they
were
with
him
and
his
name
his
presence
his
history
in
any
wayâ€
â€œoh
the
little
lady
doesnâ€™t
remember
she
never
heard
or
knewâ€
â€œthe
circumstances
of
his
deathâ€
i
thought
with
some
intensity
â€œperhaps
not
but
miles
would
rememberâ€”miles
would
knowâ€
â€œah
donâ€™t
try
himâ€
broke
from
mrs
grose
i
returned
her
the
look
she
had
given
me
â€œdonâ€™t
be
afraidâ€
i
continued
to
think
â€œit
is
rather
oddâ€
â€œthat
he
has
never
spoken
of
himâ€
â€œnever
by
the
least
allusion
and
you
tell
me
they
were
â€˜great
friendsâ€™â€
â€œoh
it
wasnâ€™t
himâ€
mrs
grose
with
emphasis
declared
â€œit
was
quintâ€™s
own
fancy
to
play
with
him
i
meanâ€”to
spoil
himâ€
she
paused
a
moment
then
she
added
â€œquint
was
much
too
freeâ€
this
gave
me
straight
from
my
vision
of
his
faceâ€”such
a
faceâ€”a
sudden
sickness
of
disgust
â€œtoo
free
with
my
boyâ€
â€œtoo
free
with
everyoneâ€
i
forbore
for
the
moment
to
analyze
this
description
further
than
by
the
reflection
that
a
part
of
it
applied
to
several
of
the
members
of
the
household
of
the
half-dozen
maids
and
men
who
were
still
of
our
small
colony
but
there
was
everything
for
our
apprehension
in
the
lucky
fact
that
no
discomfortable
legend
no
perturbation
of
scullions
had
ever
within
anyoneâ€™s
memory
attached
to
the
kind
old
place
it
had
neither
bad
name
nor
ill
fame
and
mrs
grose
most
apparently
only
desired
to
cling
to
me
and
to
quake
in
silence
i
even
put
her
the
very
last
thing
of
all
to
the
test
it
was
when
at
midnight
she
had
her
hand
on
the
schoolroom
door
to
take
leave
â€œi
have
it
from
you
thenâ€”for
itâ€™s
of
great
importanceâ€”that
he
was
definitely
and
admittedly
badâ€
â€œoh
not
admittedly
i
knew
itâ€”but
the
master
didnâ€™tâ€
â€œand
you
never
told
himâ€
â€œwell
he
didnâ€™t
like
tale-bearingâ€”he
hated
complaints
he
was
terribly
short
with
anything
of
that
kind
and
if
people
were
all
right
to
himâ€”â€
â€œhe
wouldnâ€™t
be
bothered
with
moreâ€
this
squared
well
enough
with
my
impressions
of
him
he
was
not
a
trouble-loving
gentleman
nor
so
very
particular
perhaps
about
some
of
the
company
he
kept
all
the
same
i
pressed
my
interlocutress
â€œi
promise
you
i
would
have
toldâ€
she
felt
my
discrimination
â€œi
daresay
i
was
wrong
but
really
i
was
afraidâ€
â€œafraid
of
whatâ€
â€œof
things
that
man
could
do
quint
was
so
cleverâ€”he
was
so
deepâ€
i
took
this
in
still
more
than
probably
i
showed
â€œyou
werenâ€™t
afraid
of
anything
else
not
of
his
effectâ€”â€
â€œhis
effectâ€
she
repeated
with
a
face
of
anguish
and
waiting
while
i
faltered
â€œon
innocent
little
precious
lives
they
were
in
your
chargeâ€
â€œno
they
were
not
in
mineâ€
she
roundly
and
distressfully
returned
â€œthe
master
believed
in
him
and
placed
him
here
because
he
was
supposed
not
to
be
well
and
the
country
air
so
good
for
him
so
he
had
everything
to
say
yesâ€â€”she
let
me
have
itâ€”â€œeven
about
themâ€
â€œthemâ€”that
creatureâ€
i
had
to
smother
a
kind
of
howl
â€œand
you
could
bear
itâ€
â€œno
i
couldnâ€™tâ€”and
i
canâ€™t
nowâ€
and
the
poor
woman
burst
into
tears
a
rigid
control
from
the
next
day
was
as
i
have
said
to
follow
them
yet
how
often
and
how
passionately
for
a
week
we
came
back
together
to
the
subject
much
as
we
had
discussed
it
that
sunday
night
i
was
in
the
immediate
later
hours
in
especialâ€”for
it
may
be
imagined
whether
i
sleptâ€”still
haunted
with
the
shadow
of
something
she
had
not
told
me
i
myself
had
kept
back
nothing
but
there
was
a
word
mrs
grose
had
kept
back
i
was
sure
moreover
by
morning
that
this
was
not
from
a
failure
of
frankness
but
because
on
every
side
there
were
fears
it
seems
to
me
indeed
in
retrospect
that
by
the
time
the
morrowâ€™s
sun
was
high
i
had
restlessly
read
into
the
fact
before
us
almost
all
the
meaning
they
were
to
receive
from
subsequent
and
more
cruel
occurrences
what
they
gave
me
above
all
was
just
the
sinister
figure
of
the
living
manâ€”the
dead
one
would
keep
awhileâ€”and
of
the
months
he
had
continuously
passed
at
bly
which
added
up
made
a
formidable
stretch
the
limit
of
this
evil
time
had
arrived
only
when
on
the
dawn
of
a
winterâ€™s
morning
peter
quint
was
found
by
a
laborer
going
to
early
work
stone
dead
on
the
road
from
the
village
a
catastrophe
explainedâ€”superficially
at
leastâ€”by
a
visible
wound
to
his
head
such
a
wound
as
might
have
been
producedâ€”and
as
on
the
final
evidence
had
beenâ€”by
a
fatal
slip
in
the
dark
and
after
leaving
the
public
house
on
the
steepish
icy
slope
a
wrong
path
altogether
at
the
bottom
of
which
he
lay
the
icy
slope
the
turn
mistaken
at
night
and
in
liquor
accounted
for
muchâ€”practically
in
the
end
and
after
the
inquest
and
boundless
chatter
for
everything
but
there
had
been
matters
in
his
lifeâ€”strange
passages
and
perils
secret
disorders
vices
more
than
suspectedâ€”that
would
have
accounted
for
a
good
deal
more
i
scarce
know
how
to
put
my
story
into
words
that
shall
be
a
credible
picture
of
my
state
of
mind
but
i
was
in
these
days
literally
able
to
find
a
joy
in
the
extraordinary
flight
of
heroism
the
occasion
demanded
of
me
i
now
saw
that
i
had
been
asked
for
a
service
admirable
and
difficult
and
there
would
be
a
greatness
in
letting
it
be
seenâ€”oh
in
the
right
quarterâ€”that
i
could
succeed
where
many
another
girl
might
have
failed
it
was
an
immense
help
to
meâ€”i
confess
i
rather
applaud
myself
as
i
look
backâ€”that
i
saw
my
service
so
strongly
and
so
simply
i
was
there
to
protect
and
defend
the
little
creatures
in
the
world
the
most
bereaved
and
the
most
lovable
the
appeal
of
whose
helplessness
had
suddenly
become
only
too
explicit
a
deep
constant
ache
of
oneâ€™s
own
committed
heart
we
were
cut
off
really
together
we
were
united
in
our
danger
they
had
nothing
but
me
and
iâ€”well
i
had
them
it
was
in
short
a
magnificent
chance
this
chance
presented
itself
to
me
in
an
image
richly
material
i
was
a
screenâ€”i
was
to
stand
before
them
the
more
i
saw
the
less
they
would
i
began
to
watch
them
in
a
stifled
suspense
a
disguised
excitement
that
might
well
had
it
continued
too
long
have
turned
to
something
like
madness
what
saved
me
as
i
now
see
was
that
it
turned
to
something
else
altogether
it
didnâ€™t
last
as
suspenseâ€”it
was
superseded
by
horrible
proofs
proofs
i
say
yesâ€”from
the
moment
i
really
took
hold
this
moment
dated
from
an
afternoon
hour
that
i
happened
to
spend
in
the
grounds
with
the
younger
of
my
pupils
alone
we
had
left
miles
indoors
on
the
red
cushion
of
a
deep
window
seat
he
had
wished
to
finish
a
book
and
i
had
been
glad
to
encourage
a
purpose
so
laudable
in
a
young
man
whose
only
defect
was
an
occasional
excess
of
the
restless
his
sister
on
the
contrary
had
been
alert
to
come
out
and
i
strolled
with
her
half
an
hour
seeking
the
shade
for
the
sun
was
still
high
and
the
day
exceptionally
warm
i
was
aware
afresh
with
her
as
we
went
of
how
like
her
brother
she
contrivedâ€”it
was
the
charming
thing
in
both
childrenâ€”to
let
me
alone
without
appearing
to
drop
me
and
to
accompany
me
without
appearing
to
surround
they
were
never
importunate
and
yet
never
listless
my
attention
to
them
all
really
went
to
seeing
them
amuse
themselves
immensely
without
me
this
was
a
spectacle
they
seemed
actively
to
prepare
and
that
engaged
me
as
an
active
admirer
i
walked
in
a
world
of
their
inventionâ€”they
had
no
occasion
whatever
to
draw
upon
mine
so
that
my
time
was
taken
only
with
being
for
them
some
remarkable
person
or
thing
that
the
game
of
the
moment
required
and
that
was
merely
thanks
to
my
superior
my
exalted
stamp
a
happy
and
highly
distinguished
sinecure
i
forget
what
i
was
on
the
present
occasion
i
only
remember
that
i
was
something
very
important
and
very
quiet
and
that
flora
was
playing
very
hard
we
were
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
as
we
had
lately
begun
geography
the
lake
was
the
sea
of
azof
suddenly
in
these
circumstances
i
became
aware
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
of
azof
we
had
an
interested
spectator
the
way
this
knowledge
gathered
in
me
was
the
strangest
thing
in
the
worldâ€”the
strangest
that
is
except
the
very
much
stranger
in
which
it
quickly
merged
itself
i
had
sat
down
with
a
piece
of
workâ€”for
i
was
something
or
other
that
could
sitâ€”on
the
old
stone
bench
which
overlooked
the
pond
and
in
this
position
i
began
to
take
in
with
certitude
and
yet
without
direct
vision
the
presence
at
a
distance
of
a
third
person
the
old
trees
the
thick
shrubbery
made
a
great
and
pleasant
shade
but
it
was
all
suffused
with
the
brightness
of
the
hot
still
hour
there
was
no
ambiguity
in
anything
none
whatever
at
least
in
the
conviction
i
from
one
moment
to
another
found
myself
forming
as
to
what
i
should
see
straight
before
me
and
across
the
lake
as
a
consequence
of
raising
my
eyes
they
were
attached
at
this
juncture
to
the
stitching
in
which
i
was
engaged
and
i
can
feel
once
more
the
spasm
of
my
effort
not
to
move
them
till
i
should
so
have
steadied
myself
as
to
be
able
to
make
up
my
mind
what
to
do
there
was
an
alien
object
in
viewâ€”a
figure
whose
right
of
presence
i
instantly
passionately
questioned
i
recollect
counting
over
perfectly
the
possibilities
reminding
myself
that
nothing
was
more
natural
for
instance
then
the
appearance
of
one
of
the
men
about
the
place
or
even
of
a
messenger
a
postman
or
a
tradesmanâ€™s
boy
from
the
village
that
reminder
had
as
little
effect
on
my
practical
certitude
as
i
was
consciousâ€”still
even
without
lookingâ€”of
its
having
upon
the
character
and
attitude
of
our
visitor
nothing
was
more
natural
than
that
these
things
should
be
the
other
things
that
they
absolutely
were
not
of
the
positive
identity
of
the
apparition
i
would
assure
myself
as
soon
as
the
small
clock
of
my
courage
should
have
ticked
out
the
right
second
meanwhile
with
an
effort
that
was
already
sharp
enough
i
transferred
my
eyes
straight
to
little
flora
who
at
the
moment
was
about
ten
yards
away
my
heart
had
stood
still
for
an
instant
with
the
wonder
and
terror
of
the
question
whether
she
too
would
see
and
i
held
my
breath
while
i
waited
for
what
a
cry
from
her
what
some
sudden
innocent
sign
either
of
interest
or
of
alarm
would
tell
me
i
waited
but
nothing
came
then
in
the
first
placeâ€”and
there
is
something
more
dire
in
this
i
feel
than
in
anything
i
have
to
relateâ€”i
was
determined
by
a
sense
that
within
a
minute
all
sounds
from
her
had
previously
dropped
and
in
the
second
by
the
circumstance
that
also
within
the
minute
she
had
in
her
play
turned
her
back
to
the
water
this
was
her
attitude
when
i
at
last
looked
at
herâ€”looked
with
the
confirmed
conviction
that
we
were
still
together
under
direct
personal
notice
she
had
picked
up
a
small
flat
piece
of
wood
which
happened
to
have
in
it
a
little
hole
that
had
evidently
suggested
to
her
the
idea
of
sticking
in
another
fragment
that
might
figure
as
a
mast
and
make
the
thing
a
boat
this
second
morsel
as
i
watched
her
she
was
very
markedly
and
intently
attempting
to
tighten
in
its
place
my
apprehension
of
what
she
was
doing
sustained
me
so
that
after
some
seconds
i
felt
i
was
ready
for
more
then
i
again
shifted
my
eyesâ€”i
faced
what
i
had
to
face
vii
i
got
hold
of
mrs
grose
as
soon
after
this
as
i
could
and
i
can
give
no
intelligible
account
of
how
i
fought
out
the
interval
yet
i
still
hear
myself
cry
as
i
fairly
threw
myself
into
her
arms
â€œthey
knowâ€”itâ€™s
too
monstrous
they
know
they
knowâ€
â€œand
what
on
earthâ€”â€
i
felt
her
incredulity
as
she
held
me
â€œwhy
all
that
we
knowâ€”and
heaven
knows
what
else
besidesâ€
then
as
she
released
me
i
made
it
out
to
her
made
it
out
perhaps
only
now
with
full
coherency
even
to
myself
â€œtwo
hours
ago
in
the
gardenâ€â€”i
could
scarce
articulateâ€”â€œflora
sawâ€
mrs
grose
took
it
as
she
might
have
taken
a
blow
in
the
stomach
â€œshe
has
told
youâ€
she
panted
â€œnot
a
wordâ€”thatâ€™s
the
horror
she
kept
it
to
herself
the
child
of
eight
that
childâ€
unutterable
still
for
me
was
the
stupefaction
of
it
mrs
grose
of
course
could
only
gape
the
wider
â€œthen
how
do
you
knowâ€
â€œi
was
thereâ€”i
saw
with
my
eyes
saw
that
she
was
perfectly
awareâ€
â€œdo
you
mean
aware
of
himâ€
â€œnoâ€”of
herâ€
i
was
conscious
as
i
spoke
that
i
looked
prodigious
things
for
i
got
the
slow
reflection
of
them
in
my
companionâ€™s
face
â€œanother
personâ€”this
time
but
a
figure
of
quite
as
unmistakable
horror
and
evil
a
woman
in
black
pale
and
dreadfulâ€”with
such
an
air
also
and
such
a
faceâ€”on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
i
was
there
with
the
childâ€”quiet
for
the
hour
and
in
the
midst
of
it
she
cameâ€
â€œcame
howâ€”from
whereâ€
â€œfrom
where
they
come
from
she
just
appeared
and
stood
thereâ€”but
not
so
nearâ€
â€œand
without
coming
nearerâ€
â€œoh
for
the
effect
and
the
feeling
she
might
have
been
as
close
as
youâ€
my
friend
with
an
odd
impulse
fell
back
a
step
â€œwas
she
someone
youâ€™ve
never
seenâ€
â€œyes
but
someone
the
child
has
someone
you
haveâ€
then
to
show
how
i
had
thought
it
all
out
â€œmy
predecessorâ€”the
one
who
diedâ€
â€œmiss
jesselâ€
â€œmiss
jessel
you
donâ€™t
believe
meâ€
i
pressed
she
turned
right
and
left
in
her
distress
â€œhow
can
you
be
sureâ€
this
drew
from
me
in
the
state
of
my
nerves
a
flash
of
impatience
â€œthen
ask
floraâ€”sheâ€™s
sureâ€
but
i
had
no
sooner
spoken
than
i
caught
myself
up
â€œno
for
godâ€™s
sake
donâ€™t
sheâ€™ll
say
she
isnâ€™tâ€”sheâ€™ll
lieâ€
mrs
grose
was
not
too
bewildered
instinctively
to
protest
â€œah
how
can
youâ€
â€œbecause
iâ€™m
clear
flora
doesnâ€™t
want
me
to
knowâ€
â€œitâ€™s
only
then
to
spare
youâ€
â€œno
noâ€”there
are
depths
depths
the
more
i
go
over
it
the
more
i
see
in
it
and
the
more
i
see
in
it
the
more
i
fear
i
donâ€™t
know
what
i
donâ€™t
seeâ€”what
i
donâ€™t
fearâ€
mrs
grose
tried
to
keep
up
with
me
â€œyou
mean
youâ€™re
afraid
of
seeing
her
againâ€
â€œoh
no
thatâ€™s
nothingâ€”nowâ€
then
i
explained
â€œitâ€™s
of
not
seeing
herâ€
but
my
companion
only
looked
wan
â€œi
donâ€™t
understand
youâ€
â€œwhy
itâ€™s
that
the
child
may
keep
it
upâ€”and
that
the
child
assuredly
willâ€”without
my
knowing
itâ€
at
the
image
of
this
possibility
mrs
grose
for
a
moment
collapsed
yet
presently
to
pull
herself
together
again
as
if
from
the
positive
force
of
the
sense
of
what
should
we
yield
an
inch
there
would
really
be
to
give
way
to
â€œdear
dearâ€”we
must
keep
our
heads
and
after
all
if
she
doesnâ€™t
mind
itâ€”â€
she
even
tried
a
grim
joke
â€œperhaps
she
likes
itâ€
â€œlikes
such
thingsâ€”a
scrap
of
an
infantâ€
â€œisnâ€™t
it
just
a
proof
of
her
blessed
innocenceâ€
my
friend
bravely
inquired
she
brought
me
for
the
instant
almost
round
â€œoh
we
must
clutch
at
thatâ€”we
must
cling
to
it
if
it
isnâ€™t
a
proof
of
what
you
say
itâ€™s
a
proof
ofâ€”god
knows
what
for
the
womanâ€™s
a
horror
of
horrorsâ€
mrs
grose
at
this
fixed
her
eyes
a
minute
on
the
ground
then
at
last
raising
them
â€œtell
me
how
you
knowâ€
she
said
â€œthen
you
admit
itâ€™s
what
she
wasâ€
i
cried
â€œtell
me
how
you
knowâ€
my
friend
simply
repeated
â€œknow
by
seeing
her
by
the
way
she
lookedâ€
â€œat
you
do
you
meanâ€”so
wickedlyâ€
â€œdear
me
noâ€”i
could
have
borne
that
she
gave
me
never
a
glance
she
only
fixed
the
childâ€
mrs
grose
tried
to
see
it
â€œfixed
herâ€
â€œah
with
such
awful
eyesâ€
she
stared
at
mine
as
if
they
might
really
have
resembled
them
â€œdo
you
mean
of
dislikeâ€
â€œgod
help
us
no
of
something
much
worseâ€
â€œworse
than
dislikeâ€â€”this
left
her
indeed
at
a
loss
â€œwith
a
determinationâ€”indescribable
with
a
kind
of
fury
of
intentionâ€
i
made
her
turn
pale
â€œintentionâ€
â€œto
get
hold
of
herâ€
mrs
groseâ€”her
eyes
just
lingering
on
mineâ€”gave
a
shudder
and
walked
to
the
window
and
while
she
stood
there
looking
out
i
completed
my
statement
â€œthatâ€™s
what
flora
knowsâ€
after
a
little
she
turned
round
â€œthe
person
was
in
black
you
sayâ€
â€œin
mourningâ€”rather
poor
almost
shabby
butâ€”yesâ€”with
extraordinary
beautyâ€
i
now
recognized
to
what
i
had
at
last
stroke
by
stroke
brought
the
victim
of
my
confidence
for
she
quite
visibly
weighed
this
â€œoh
handsomeâ€”very
veryâ€
i
insisted
â€œwonderfully
handsome
but
infamousâ€
she
slowly
came
back
to
me
â€œmiss
jesselâ€”was
infamousâ€
she
once
more
took
my
hand
in
both
her
own
holding
it
as
tight
as
if
to
fortify
me
against
the
increase
of
alarm
i
might
draw
from
this
disclosure
â€œthey
were
both
infamousâ€
she
finally
said
so
for
a
little
we
faced
it
once
more
together
and
i
found
absolutely
a
degree
of
help
in
seeing
it
now
so
straight
â€œi
appreciateâ€
i
said
â€œthe
great
decency
of
your
not
having
hitherto
spoken
but
the
time
has
certainly
come
to
give
me
the
whole
thingâ€
she
appeared
to
assent
to
this
but
still
only
in
silence
seeing
which
i
went
on
â€œi
must
have
it
now
of
what
did
she
die
come
there
was
something
between
themâ€
â€œthere
was
everythingâ€
â€œin
spite
of
the
differenceâ€”â€
â€œoh
of
their
rank
their
conditionâ€â€”she
brought
it
woefully
out
â€œshe
was
a
ladyâ€
i
turned
it
over
i
again
saw
â€œyesâ€”she
was
a
ladyâ€
â€œand
he
so
dreadfully
belowâ€
said
mrs
grose
i
felt
that
i
doubtless
neednâ€™t
press
too
hard
in
such
company
on
the
place
of
a
servant
in
the
scale
but
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
an
acceptance
of
my
companionâ€™s
own
measure
of
my
predecessorâ€™s
abasement
there
was
a
way
to
deal
with
that
and
i
dealt
the
more
readily
for
my
full
visionâ€”on
the
evidenceâ€”of
our
employerâ€™s
late
clever
good-looking
â€œownâ€
man
impudent
assured
spoiled
depraved
â€œthe
fellow
was
a
houndâ€
mrs
grose
considered
as
if
it
were
perhaps
a
little
a
case
for
a
sense
of
shades
â€œiâ€™ve
never
seen
one
like
him
he
did
what
he
wishedâ€
â€œwith
herâ€
â€œwith
them
allâ€
it
was
as
if
now
in
my
friendâ€™s
own
eyes
miss
jessel
had
again
appeared
i
seemed
at
any
rate
for
an
instant
to
see
their
evocation
of
her
as
distinctly
as
i
had
seen
her
by
the
pond
and
i
brought
out
with
decision
â€œit
must
have
been
also
what
she
wishedâ€
mrs
groseâ€™s
face
signified
that
it
had
been
indeed
but
she
said
at
the
same
time
â€œpoor
womanâ€”she
paid
for
itâ€
â€œthen
you
do
know
what
she
died
ofâ€
i
asked
â€œnoâ€”i
know
nothing
i
wanted
not
to
know
i
was
glad
enough
i
didnâ€™t
and
i
thanked
heaven
she
was
well
out
of
thisâ€
â€œyet
you
had
then
your
ideaâ€”â€
â€œof
her
real
reason
for
leaving
oh
yesâ€”as
to
that
she
couldnâ€™t
have
stayed
fancy
it
hereâ€”for
a
governess
and
afterward
i
imaginedâ€”and
i
still
imagine
and
what
i
imagine
is
dreadfulâ€
â€œnot
so
dreadful
as
what
i
doâ€
i
replied
on
which
i
must
have
shown
herâ€”as
i
was
indeed
but
too
consciousâ€”a
front
of
miserable
defeat
it
brought
out
again
all
her
compassion
for
me
and
at
the
renewed
touch
of
her
kindness
my
power
to
resist
broke
down
i
burst
as
i
had
the
other
time
made
her
burst
into
tears
she
took
me
to
her
motherly
breast
and
my
lamentation
overflowed
â€œi
donâ€™t
do
itâ€
i
sobbed
in
despair
â€œi
donâ€™t
save
or
shield
them
itâ€™s
far
worse
than
i
dreamedâ€”theyâ€™re
lostâ€
viii
what
i
had
said
to
mrs
grose
was
true
enough
there
were
in
the
matter
i
had
put
before
her
depths
and
possibilities
that
i
lacked
resolution
to
sound
so
that
when
we
met
once
more
in
the
wonder
of
it
we
were
of
a
common
mind
about
the
duty
of
resistance
to
extravagant
fancies
we
were
to
keep
our
heads
if
we
should
keep
nothing
elseâ€”difficult
indeed
as
that
might
be
in
the
face
of
what
in
our
prodigious
experience
was
least
to
be
questioned
late
that
night
while
the
house
slept
we
had
another
talk
in
my
room
when
she
went
all
the
way
with
me
as
to
its
being
beyond
doubt
that
i
had
seen
exactly
what
i
had
seen
to
hold
her
perfectly
in
the
pinch
of
that
i
found
i
had
only
to
ask
her
how
if
i
had
â€œmade
it
upâ€
i
came
to
be
able
to
give
of
each
of
the
persons
appearing
to
me
a
picture
disclosing
to
the
last
detail
their
special
marksâ€”a
portrait
on
the
exhibition
of
which
she
had
instantly
recognized
and
named
them
she
wished
of
courseâ€”small
blame
to
herâ€”to
sink
the
whole
subject
and
i
was
quick
to
assure
her
that
my
own
interest
in
it
had
now
violently
taken
the
form
of
a
search
for
the
way
to
escape
from
it
i
encountered
her
on
the
ground
of
a
probability
that
with
recurrenceâ€”for
recurrence
we
took
for
grantedâ€”i
should
get
used
to
my
danger
distinctly
professing
that
my
personal
exposure
had
suddenly
become
the
least
of
my
discomforts
it
was
my
new
suspicion
that
was
intolerable
and
yet
even
to
this
complication
the
later
hours
of
the
day
had
brought
a
little
ease
on
leaving
her
after
my
first
outbreak
i
had
of
course
returned
to
my
pupils
associating
the
right
remedy
for
my
dismay
with
that
sense
of
their
charm
which
i
had
already
found
to
be
a
thing
i
could
positively
cultivate
and
which
had
never
failed
me
yet
i
had
simply
in
other
words
plunged
afresh
into
floraâ€™s
special
society
and
there
become
awareâ€”it
was
almost
a
luxuryâ€”that
she
could
put
her
little
conscious
hand
straight
upon
the
spot
that
ached
she
had
looked
at
me
in
sweet
speculation
and
then
had
accused
me
to
my
face
of
having
â€œcriedâ€
i
had
supposed
i
had
brushed
away
the
ugly
signs
but
i
could
literallyâ€”for
the
time
at
all
eventsâ€”rejoice
under
this
fathomless
charity
that
they
had
not
entirely
disappeared
to
gaze
into
the
depths
of
blue
of
the
childâ€™s
eyes
and
pronounce
their
loveliness
a
trick
of
premature
cunning
was
to
be
guilty
of
a
cynicism
in
preference
to
which
i
naturally
preferred
to
abjure
my
judgment
and
so
far
as
might
be
my
agitation
i
couldnâ€™t
abjure
for
merely
wanting
to
but
i
could
repeat
to
mrs
groseâ€”as
i
did
there
over
and
over
in
the
small
hoursâ€”that
with
their
voices
in
the
air
their
pressure
on
oneâ€™s
heart
and
their
fragrant
faces
against
oneâ€™s
cheek
everything
fell
to
the
ground
but
their
incapacity
and
their
beauty
it
was
a
pity
that
somehow
to
settle
this
once
for
all
i
had
equally
to
re-enumerate
the
signs
of
subtlety
that
in
the
afternoon
by
the
lake
had
made
a
miracle
of
my
show
of
self-possession
it
was
a
pity
to
be
obliged
to
reinvestigate
the
certitude
of
the
moment
itself
and
repeat
how
it
had
come
to
me
as
a
revelation
that
the
inconceivable
communion
i
then
surprised
was
a
matter
for
either
party
of
habit
it
was
a
pity
that
i
should
have
had
to
quaver
out
again
the
reasons
for
my
not
having
in
my
delusion
so
much
as
questioned
that
the
little
girl
saw
our
visitant
even
as
i
actually
saw
mrs
grose
herself
and
that
she
wanted
by
just
so
much
as
she
did
thus
see
to
make
me
suppose
she
didnâ€™t
and
at
the
same
time
without
showing
anything
arrive
at
a
guess
as
to
whether
i
myself
did
it
was
a
pity
that
i
needed
once
more
to
describe
the
portentous
little
activity
by
which
she
sought
to
divert
my
attentionâ€”the
perceptible
increase
of
movement
the
greater
intensity
of
play
the
singing
the
gabbling
of
nonsense
and
the
invitation
to
romp
yet
if
i
had
not
indulged
to
prove
there
was
nothing
in
it
in
this
review
i
should
have
missed
the
two
or
three
dim
elements
of
comfort
that
still
remained
to
me
i
should
not
for
instance
have
been
able
to
asseverate
to
my
friend
that
i
was
certainâ€”which
was
so
much
to
the
goodâ€”that
i
at
least
had
not
betrayed
myself
i
should
not
have
been
prompted
by
stress
of
need
by
desperation
of
mindâ€”i
scarce
know
what
to
call
itâ€”to
invoke
such
further
aid
to
intelligence
as
might
spring
from
pushing
my
colleague
fairly
to
the
wall
she
had
told
me
bit
by
bit
under
pressure
a
great
deal
but
a
small
shifty
spot
on
the
wrong
side
of
it
all
still
sometimes
brushed
my
brow
like
the
wing
of
a
bat
and
i
remember
how
on
this
occasionâ€”for
the
sleeping
house
and
the
concentration
alike
of
our
danger
and
our
watch
seemed
to
helpâ€”i
felt
the
importance
of
giving
the
last
jerk
to
the
curtain
â€œi
donâ€™t
believe
anything
so
horribleâ€
i
recollect
saying
â€œno
let
us
put
it
definitely
my
dear
that
i
donâ€™t
but
if
i
did
you
know
thereâ€™s
a
thing
i
should
require
now
just
without
sparing
you
the
least
bit
moreâ€”oh
not
a
scrap
comeâ€”to
get
out
of
you
what
was
it
you
had
in
mind
when
in
our
distress
before
miles
came
back
over
the
letter
from
his
school
you
said
under
my
insistence
that
you
didnâ€™t
pretend
for
him
that
he
had
not
literally
ever
been
â€˜badâ€™
he
has
not
literally
â€˜everâ€™
in
these
weeks
that
i
myself
have
lived
with
him
and
so
closely
watched
him
he
has
been
an
imperturbable
little
prodigy
of
delightful
lovable
goodness
therefore
you
might
perfectly
have
made
the
claim
for
him
if
you
had
not
as
it
happened
seen
an
exception
to
take
what
was
your
exception
and
to
what
passage
in
your
personal
observation
of
him
did
you
referâ€
it
was
a
dreadfully
austere
inquiry
but
levity
was
not
our
note
and
at
any
rate
before
the
gray
dawn
admonished
us
to
separate
i
had
got
my
answer
what
my
friend
had
had
in
mind
proved
to
be
immensely
to
the
purpose
it
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
circumstance
that
for
a
period
of
several
months
quint
and
the
boy
had
been
perpetually
together
it
was
in
fact
the
very
appropriate
truth
that
she
had
ventured
to
criticize
the
propriety
to
hint
at
the
incongruity
of
so
close
an
alliance
and
even
to
go
so
far
on
the
subject
as
a
frank
overture
to
miss
jessel
miss
jessel
had
with
a
most
strange
manner
requested
her
to
mind
her
business
and
the
good
woman
had
on
this
directly
approached
little
miles
what
she
had
said
to
him
since
i
pressed
was
that
she
liked
to
see
young
gentlemen
not
forget
their
station
i
pressed
again
of
course
at
this
â€œyou
reminded
him
that
quint
was
only
a
base
menialâ€
â€œas
you
might
say
and
it
was
his
answer
for
one
thing
that
was
badâ€
â€œand
for
another
thingâ€
i
waited
â€œhe
repeated
your
words
to
quintâ€
â€œno
not
that
itâ€™s
just
what
he
wouldnâ€™tâ€
she
could
still
impress
upon
me
â€œi
was
sure
at
any
rateâ€
she
added
â€œthat
he
didnâ€™t
but
he
denied
certain
occasionsâ€
â€œwhat
occasionsâ€
â€œwhen
they
had
been
about
together
quite
as
if
quint
were
his
tutorâ€”and
a
very
grand
oneâ€”and
miss
jessel
only
for
the
little
lady
when
he
had
gone
off
with
the
fellow
i
mean
and
spent
hours
with
himâ€
â€œhe
then
prevaricated
about
itâ€”he
said
he
hadnâ€™tâ€
her
assent
was
clear
enough
to
cause
me
to
add
in
a
moment
â€œi
see
he
liedâ€
â€œohâ€
mrs
grose
mumbled
this
was
a
suggestion
that
it
didnâ€™t
matter
which
indeed
she
backed
up
by
a
further
remark
â€œyou
see
after
all
miss
jessel
didnâ€™t
mind
she
didnâ€™t
forbid
himâ€
i
considered
â€œdid
he
put
that
to
you
as
a
justificationâ€
at
this
she
dropped
again
â€œno
he
never
spoke
of
itâ€
â€œnever
mentioned
her
in
connection
with
quintâ€
she
saw
visibly
flushing
where
i
was
coming
out
â€œwell
he
didnâ€™t
show
anything
he
deniedâ€
she
repeated
â€œhe
deniedâ€
lord
how
i
pressed
her
now
â€œso
that
you
could
see
he
knew
what
was
between
the
two
wretchesâ€
â€œi
donâ€™t
knowâ€”i
donâ€™t
knowâ€
the
poor
woman
groaned
â€œyou
do
know
you
dear
thingâ€
i
replied
â€œonly
you
havenâ€™t
my
dreadful
boldness
of
mind
and
you
keep
back
out
of
timidity
and
modesty
and
delicacy
even
the
impression
that
in
the
past
when
you
had
without
my
aid
to
flounder
about
in
silence
most
of
all
made
you
miserable
but
i
shall
get
it
out
of
you
yet
there
was
something
in
the
boy
that
suggested
to
youâ€
i
continued
â€œthat
he
covered
and
concealed
their
relationâ€
â€œoh
he
couldnâ€™t
preventâ€”â€
â€œyour
learning
the
truth
i
daresay
but
heavensâ€
i
fell
with
vehemence
athinking
â€œwhat
it
shows
that
they
must
to
that
extent
have
succeeded
in
making
of
himâ€
â€œah
nothing
thatâ€™s
not
nice
nowâ€
mrs
grose
lugubriously
pleaded
â€œi
donâ€™t
wonder
you
looked
queerâ€
i
persisted
â€œwhen
i
mentioned
to
you
the
letter
from
his
schoolâ€
â€œi
doubt
if
i
looked
as
queer
as
youâ€
she
retorted
with
homely
force
â€œand
if
he
was
so
bad
then
as
that
comes
to
how
is
he
such
an
angel
nowâ€
â€œyes
indeedâ€”and
if
he
was
a
fiend
at
school
how
how
how
wellâ€
i
said
in
my
torment
â€œyou
must
put
it
to
me
again
but
i
shall
not
be
able
to
tell
you
for
some
days
only
put
it
to
me
againâ€
i
cried
in
a
way
that
made
my
friend
stare
â€œthere
are
directions
in
which
i
must
not
for
the
present
let
myself
goâ€
meanwhile
i
returned
to
her
first
exampleâ€”the
one
to
which
she
had
just
previously
referredâ€”of
the
boyâ€™s
happy
capacity
for
an
occasional
slip
â€œif
quintâ€”on
your
remonstrance
at
the
time
you
speak
ofâ€”was
a
base
menial
one
of
the
things
miles
said
to
you
i
find
myself
guessing
was
that
you
were
anotherâ€
again
her
admission
was
so
adequate
that
i
continued
â€œand
you
forgave
him
thatâ€
â€œwouldnâ€™t
youâ€
â€œoh
yesâ€
and
we
exchanged
there
in
the
stillness
a
sound
of
the
oddest
amusement
then
i
went
on
â€œat
all
events
while
he
was
with
the
manâ€”â€
â€œmiss
flora
was
with
the
woman
it
suited
them
allâ€
it
suited
me
too
i
felt
only
too
well
by
which
i
mean
that
it
suited
exactly
the
particularly
deadly
view
i
was
in
the
very
act
of
forbidding
myself
to
entertain
but
i
so
far
succeeded
in
checking
the
expression
of
this
view
that
i
will
throw
just
here
no
further
light
on
it
than
may
be
offered
by
the
mention
of
my
final
observation
to
mrs
grose
â€œhis
having
lied
and
been
impudent
are
i
confess
less
engaging
specimens
than
i
had
hoped
to
have
from
you
of
the
outbreak
in
him
of
the
little
natural
man
stillâ€
i
mused
â€œthey
must
do
for
they
make
me
feel
more
than
ever
that
i
must
watchâ€
it
made
me
blush
the
next
minute
to
see
in
my
friendâ€™s
face
how
much
more
unreservedly
she
had
forgiven
him
than
her
anecdote
struck
me
as
presenting
to
my
own
tenderness
an
occasion
for
doing
this
came
out
when
at
the
schoolroom
door
she
quitted
me
â€œsurely
you
donâ€™t
accuse
himâ€”â€
â€œof
carrying
on
an
intercourse
that
he
conceals
from
me
ah
remember
that
until
further
evidence
i
now
accuse
nobodyâ€
then
before
shutting
her
out
to
go
by
another
passage
to
her
own
place
â€œi
must
just
waitâ€
i
wound
up
ix
i
waited
and
waited
and
the
days
as
they
elapsed
took
something
from
my
consternation
a
very
few
of
them
in
fact
passing
in
constant
sight
of
my
pupils
without
a
fresh
incident
sufficed
to
give
to
grievous
fancies
and
even
to
odious
memories
a
kind
of
brush
of
the
sponge
i
have
spoken
of
the
surrender
to
their
extraordinary
childish
grace
as
a
thing
i
could
actively
cultivate
and
it
may
be
imagined
if
i
neglected
now
to
address
myself
to
this
source
for
whatever
it
would
yield
stranger
than
i
can
express
certainly
was
the
effort
to
struggle
against
my
new
lights
it
would
doubtless
have
been
however
a
greater
tension
still
had
it
not
been
so
frequently
successful
i
used
to
wonder
how
my
little
charges
could
help
guessing
that
i
thought
strange
things
about
them
and
the
circumstances
that
these
things
only
made
them
more
interesting
was
not
by
itself
a
direct
aid
to
keeping
them
in
the
dark
i
trembled
lest
they
should
see
that
they
were
so
immensely
more
interesting
putting
things
at
the
worst
at
all
events
as
in
meditation
i
so
often
did
any
clouding
of
their
innocence
could
only
beâ€”blameless
and
foredoomed
as
they
wereâ€”a
reason
the
more
for
taking
risks
there
were
moments
when
by
an
irresistible
impulse
i
found
myself
catching
them
up
and
pressing
them
to
my
heart
as
soon
as
i
had
done
so
i
used
to
say
to
myself
â€œwhat
will
they
think
of
that
doesnâ€™t
it
betray
too
muchâ€
it
would
have
been
easy
to
get
into
a
sad
wild
tangle
about
how
much
i
might
betray
but
the
real
account
i
feel
of
the
hours
of
peace
that
i
could
still
enjoy
was
that
the
immediate
charm
of
my
companions
was
a
beguilement
still
effective
even
under
the
shadow
of
the
possibility
that
it
was
studied
for
if
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
occasionally
excite
suspicion
by
the
little
outbreaks
of
my
sharper
passion
for
them
so
too
i
remember
wondering
if
i
mightnâ€™t
see
a
queerness
in
the
traceable
increase
of
their
own
demonstrations
they
were
at
this
period
extravagantly
and
preternaturally
fond
of
me
which
after
all
i
could
reflect
was
no
more
than
a
graceful
response
in
children
perpetually
bowed
over
and
hugged
the
homage
of
which
they
were
so
lavish
succeeded
in
truth
for
my
nerves
quite
as
well
as
if
i
never
appeared
to
myself
as
i
may
say
literally
to
catch
them
at
a
purpose
in
it
they
had
never
i
think
wanted
to
do
so
many
things
for
their
poor
protectress
i
meanâ€”though
they
got
their
lessons
better
and
better
which
was
naturally
what
would
please
her
mostâ€”in
the
way
of
diverting
entertaining
surprising
her
reading
her
passages
telling
her
stories
acting
her
charades
pouncing
out
at
her
in
disguises
as
animals
and
historical
characters
and
above
all
astonishing
her
by
the
â€œpiecesâ€
they
had
secretly
got
by
heart
and
could
interminably
recite
i
should
never
get
to
the
bottomâ€”were
i
to
let
myself
go
even
nowâ€”of
the
prodigious
private
commentary
all
under
still
more
private
correction
with
which
in
these
days
i
overscored
their
full
hours
they
had
shown
me
from
the
first
a
facility
for
everything
a
general
faculty
which
taking
a
fresh
start
achieved
remarkable
flights
they
got
their
little
tasks
as
if
they
loved
them
and
indulged
from
the
mere
exuberance
of
the
gift
in
the
most
unimposed
little
miracles
of
memory
they
not
only
popped
out
at
me
as
tigers
and
as
romans
but
as
shakespeareans
astronomers
and
navigators
this
was
so
singularly
the
case
that
it
had
presumably
much
to
do
with
the
fact
as
to
which
at
the
present
day
i
am
at
a
loss
for
a
different
explanation
i
allude
to
my
unnatural
composure
on
the
subject
of
another
school
for
miles
what
i
remember
is
that
i
was
content
not
for
the
time
to
open
the
question
and
that
contentment
must
have
sprung
from
the
sense
of
his
perpetually
striking
show
of
cleverness
he
was
too
clever
for
a
bad
governess
for
a
parsonâ€™s
daughter
to
spoil
and
the
strangest
if
not
the
brightest
thread
in
the
pensive
embroidery
i
just
spoke
of
was
the
impression
i
might
have
got
if
i
had
dared
to
work
it
out
that
he
was
under
some
influence
operating
in
his
small
intellectual
life
as
a
tremendous
incitement
if
it
was
easy
to
reflect
however
that
such
a
boy
could
postpone
school
it
was
at
least
as
marked
that
for
such
a
boy
to
have
been
â€œkicked
outâ€
by
a
schoolmaster
was
a
mystification
without
end
let
me
add
that
in
their
company
nowâ€”and
i
was
careful
almost
never
to
be
out
of
itâ€”i
could
follow
no
scent
very
far
we
lived
in
a
cloud
of
music
and
love
and
success
and
private
theatricals
the
musical
sense
in
each
of
the
children
was
of
the
quickest
but
the
elder
in
especial
had
a
marvelous
knack
of
catching
and
repeating
the
schoolroom
piano
broke
into
all
gruesome
fancies
and
when
that
failed
there
were
confabulations
in
corners
with
a
sequel
of
one
of
them
going
out
in
the
highest
spirits
in
order
to
â€œcome
inâ€
as
something
new
i
had
had
brothers
myself
and
it
was
no
revelation
to
me
that
little
girls
could
be
slavish
idolaters
of
little
boys
what
surpassed
everything
was
that
there
was
a
little
boy
in
the
world
who
could
have
for
the
inferior
age
sex
and
intelligence
so
fine
a
consideration
they
were
extraordinarily
at
one
and
to
say
that
they
never
either
quarreled
or
complained
is
to
make
the
note
of
praise
coarse
for
their
quality
of
sweetness
sometimes
indeed
when
i
dropped
into
coarseness
i
perhaps
came
across
traces
of
little
understandings
between
them
by
which
one
of
them
should
keep
me
occupied
while
the
other
slipped
away
there
is
a
naã¯f
side
i
suppose
in
all
diplomacy
but
if
my
pupils
practiced
upon
me
it
was
surely
with
the
minimum
of
grossness
it
was
all
in
the
other
quarter
that
after
a
lull
the
grossness
broke
out
i
find
that
i
really
hang
back
but
i
must
take
my
plunge
in
going
on
with
the
record
of
what
was
hideous
at
bly
i
not
only
challenge
the
most
liberal
faithâ€”for
which
i
little
care
butâ€”and
this
is
another
matterâ€”i
renew
what
i
myself
suffered
i
again
push
my
way
through
it
to
the
end
there
came
suddenly
an
hour
after
which
as
i
look
back
the
affair
seems
to
me
to
have
been
all
pure
suffering
but
i
have
at
least
reached
the
heart
of
it
and
the
straightest
road
out
is
doubtless
to
advance
one
eveningâ€”with
nothing
to
lead
up
or
to
prepare
itâ€”i
felt
the
cold
touch
of
the
impression
that
had
breathed
on
me
the
night
of
my
arrival
and
which
much
lighter
then
as
i
have
mentioned
i
should
probably
have
made
little
of
in
memory
had
my
subsequent
sojourn
been
less
agitated
i
had
not
gone
to
bed
i
sat
reading
by
a
couple
of
candles
there
was
a
roomful
of
old
books
at
blyâ€”last-century
fiction
some
of
it
which
to
the
extent
of
a
distinctly
deprecated
renown
but
never
to
so
much
as
that
of
a
stray
specimen
had
reached
the
sequestered
home
and
appealed
to
the
unavowed
curiosity
of
my
youth
i
remember
that
the
book
i
had
in
my
hand
was
fieldingâ€™s
amelia
also
that
i
was
wholly
awake
i
recall
further
both
a
general
conviction
that
it
was
horribly
late
and
a
particular
objection
to
looking
at
my
watch
i
figure
finally
that
the
white
curtain
draping
in
the
fashion
of
those
days
the
head
of
floraâ€™s
little
bed
shrouded
as
i
had
assured
myself
long
before
the
perfection
of
childish
rest
i
recollect
in
short
that
though
i
was
deeply
interested
in
my
author
i
found
myself
at
the
turn
of
a
page
and
with
his
spell
all
scattered
looking
straight
up
from
him
and
hard
at
the
door
of
my
room
there
was
a
moment
during
which
i
listened
reminded
of
the
faint
sense
i
had
had
the
first
night
of
there
being
something
undefinably
astir
in
the
house
and
noted
the
soft
breath
of
the
open
casement
just
move
the
half-drawn
blind
then
with
all
the
marks
of
a
deliberation
that
must
have
seemed
magnificent
had
there
been
anyone
to
admire
it
i
laid
down
my
book
rose
to
my
feet
and
taking
a
candle
went
straight
out
of
the
room
and
from
the
passage
on
which
my
light
made
little
impression
noiselessly
closed
and
locked
the
door
i
can
say
now
neither
what
determined
nor
what
guided
me
but
i
went
straight
along
the
lobby
holding
my
candle
high
till
i
came
within
sight
of
the
tall
window
that
presided
over
the
great
turn
of
the
staircase
at
this
point
i
precipitately
found
myself
aware
of
three
things
they
were
practically
simultaneous
yet
they
had
flashes
of
succession
my
candle
under
a
bold
flourish
went
out
and
i
perceived
by
the
uncovered
window
that
the
yielding
dusk
of
earliest
morning
rendered
it
unnecessary
without
it
the
next
instant
i
saw
that
there
was
someone
on
the
stair
i
speak
of
sequences
but
i
required
no
lapse
of
seconds
to
stiffen
myself
for
a
third
encounter
with
quint
the
apparition
had
reached
the
landing
halfway
up
and
was
therefore
on
the
spot
nearest
the
window
where
at
sight
of
me
it
stopped
short
and
fixed
me
exactly
as
it
had
fixed
me
from
the
tower
and
from
the
garden
he
knew
me
as
well
as
i
knew
him
and
so
in
the
cold
faint
twilight
with
a
glimmer
in
the
high
glass
and
another
on
the
polish
of
the
oak
stair
below
we
faced
each
other
in
our
common
intensity
he
was
absolutely
on
this
occasion
a
living
detestable
dangerous
presence
but
that
was
not
the
wonder
of
wonders
i
reserve
this
distinction
for
quite
another
circumstance
the
circumstance
that
dread
had
unmistakably
quitted
me
and
that
there
was
nothing
in
me
there
that
didnâ€™t
meet
and
measure
him
i
had
plenty
of
anguish
after
that
extraordinary
moment
but
i
had
thank
god
no
terror
and
he
knew
i
had
notâ€”i
found
myself
at
the
end
of
an
instant
magnificently
aware
of
this
i
felt
in
a
fierce
rigor
of
confidence
that
if
i
stood
my
ground
a
minute
i
should
ceaseâ€”for
the
time
at
leastâ€”to
have
him
to
reckon
with
and
during
the
minute
accordingly
the
thing
was
as
human
and
hideous
as
a
real
interview
hideous
just
because
it
was
human
as
human
as
to
have
met
alone
in
the
small
hours
in
a
sleeping
house
some
enemy
some
adventurer
some
criminal
it
was
the
dead
silence
of
our
long
gaze
at
such
close
quarters
that
gave
the
whole
horror
huge
as
it
was
its
only
note
of
the
unnatural
if
i
had
met
a
murderer
in
such
a
place
and
at
such
an
hour
we
still
at
least
would
have
spoken
something
would
have
passed
in
life
between
us
if
nothing
had
passed
one
of
us
would
have
moved
the
moment
was
so
prolonged
that
it
would
have
taken
but
little
more
to
make
me
doubt
if
even
i
were
in
life
i
canâ€™t
express
what
followed
it
save
by
saying
that
the
silence
itselfâ€”which
was
indeed
in
a
manner
an
attestation
of
my
strengthâ€”became
the
element
into
which
i
saw
the
figure
disappear
in
which
i
definitely
saw
it
turn
as
i
might
have
seen
the
low
wretch
to
which
it
had
once
belonged
turn
on
receipt
of
an
order
and
pass
with
my
eyes
on
the
villainous
back
that
no
hunch
could
have
more
disfigured
straight
down
the
staircase
and
into
the
darkness
in
which
the
next
bend
was
lost
x
i
remained
awhile
at
the
top
of
the
stair
but
with
the
effect
presently
of
understanding
that
when
my
visitor
had
gone
he
had
gone
then
i
returned
to
my
room
the
foremost
thing
i
saw
there
by
the
light
of
the
candle
i
had
left
burning
was
that
floraâ€™s
little
bed
was
empty
and
on
this
i
caught
my
breath
with
all
the
terror
that
five
minutes
before
i
had
been
able
to
resist
i
dashed
at
the
place
in
which
i
had
left
her
lying
and
over
which
for
the
small
silk
counterpane
and
the
sheets
were
disarranged
the
white
curtains
had
been
deceivingly
pulled
forward
then
my
step
to
my
unutterable
relief
produced
an
answering
sound
i
perceived
an
agitation
of
the
window
blind
and
the
child
ducking
down
emerged
rosily
from
the
other
side
of
it
she
stood
there
in
so
much
of
her
candor
and
so
little
of
her
nightgown
with
her
pink
bare
feet
and
the
golden
glow
of
her
curls
she
looked
intensely
grave
and
i
had
never
had
such
a
sense
of
losing
an
advantage
acquired
the
thrill
of
which
had
just
been
so
prodigious
as
on
my
consciousness
that
she
addressed
me
with
a
reproach
â€œyou
naughty
where
have
you
beenâ€â€”instead
of
challenging
her
own
irregularity
i
found
myself
arraigned
and
explaining
she
herself
explained
for
that
matter
with
the
loveliest
eagerest
simplicity
she
had
known
suddenly
as
she
lay
there
that
i
was
out
of
the
room
and
had
jumped
up
to
see
what
had
become
of
me
i
had
dropped
with
the
joy
of
her
reappearance
back
into
my
chairâ€”feeling
then
and
then
only
a
little
faint
and
she
had
pattered
straight
over
to
me
thrown
herself
upon
my
knee
given
herself
to
be
held
with
the
flame
of
the
candle
full
in
the
wonderful
little
face
that
was
still
flushed
with
sleep
i
remember
closing
my
eyes
an
instant
yieldingly
consciously
as
before
the
excess
of
something
beautiful
that
shone
out
of
the
blue
of
her
own
â€œyou
were
looking
for
me
out
of
the
windowâ€
i
said
â€œyou
thought
i
might
be
walking
in
the
groundsâ€
â€œwell
you
know
i
thought
someone
wasâ€â€”she
never
blanched
as
she
smiled
out
that
at
me
oh
how
i
looked
at
her
now
â€œand
did
you
see
anyoneâ€
â€œah
noâ€
she
returned
almost
with
the
full
privilege
of
childish
inconsequence
resentfully
though
with
a
long
sweetness
in
her
little
drawl
of
the
negative
at
that
moment
in
the
state
of
my
nerves
i
absolutely
believed
she
lied
and
if
i
once
more
closed
my
eyes
it
was
before
the
dazzle
of
the
three
or
four
possible
ways
in
which
i
might
take
this
up
one
of
these
for
a
moment
tempted
me
with
such
singular
intensity
that
to
withstand
it
i
must
have
gripped
my
little
girl
with
a
spasm
that
wonderfully
she
submitted
to
without
a
cry
or
a
sign
of
fright
why
not
break
out
at
her
on
the
spot
and
have
it
all
overâ€”give
it
to
her
straight
in
her
lovely
little
lighted
face
â€œyou
see
you
see
you
know
that
you
do
and
that
you
already
quite
suspect
i
believe
it
therefore
why
not
frankly
confess
it
to
me
so
that
we
may
at
least
live
with
it
together
and
learn
perhaps
in
the
strangeness
of
our
fate
where
we
are
and
what
it
meansâ€
this
solicitation
dropped
alas
as
it
came
if
i
could
immediately
have
succumbed
to
it
i
might
have
spared
myselfâ€”well
youâ€™ll
see
what
instead
of
succumbing
i
sprang
again
to
my
feet
looked
at
her
bed
and
took
a
helpless
middle
way
â€œwhy
did
you
pull
the
curtain
over
the
place
to
make
me
think
you
were
still
thereâ€
flora
luminously
considered
after
which
with
her
little
divine
smile
â€œbecause
i
donâ€™t
like
to
frighten
youâ€
â€œbut
if
i
had
by
your
idea
gone
outâ€”â€
she
absolutely
declined
to
be
puzzled
she
turned
her
eyes
to
the
flame
of
the
candle
as
if
the
question
were
as
irrelevant
or
at
any
rate
as
impersonal
as
mrs
marcet
or
nine-times-nine
â€œoh
but
you
knowâ€
she
quite
adequately
answered
â€œthat
you
might
come
back
you
dear
and
that
you
haveâ€
and
after
a
little
when
she
had
got
into
bed
i
had
for
a
long
time
by
almost
sitting
on
her
to
hold
her
hand
to
prove
that
i
recognized
the
pertinence
of
my
return
you
may
imagine
the
general
complexion
from
that
moment
of
my
nights
i
repeatedly
sat
up
till
i
didnâ€™t
know
when
i
selected
moments
when
my
roommate
unmistakably
slept
and
stealing
out
took
noiseless
turns
in
the
passage
and
even
pushed
as
far
as
to
where
i
had
last
met
quint
but
i
never
met
him
there
again
and
i
may
as
well
say
at
once
that
i
on
no
other
occasion
saw
him
in
the
house
i
just
missed
on
the
staircase
on
the
other
hand
a
different
adventure
looking
down
it
from
the
top
i
once
recognized
the
presence
of
a
woman
seated
on
one
of
the
lower
steps
with
her
back
presented
to
me
her
body
half-bowed
and
her
head
in
an
attitude
of
woe
in
her
hands
i
had
been
there
but
an
instant
however
when
she
vanished
without
looking
round
at
me
i
knew
nonetheless
exactly
what
dreadful
face
she
had
to
show
and
i
wondered
whether
if
instead
of
being
above
i
had
been
below
i
should
have
had
for
going
up
the
same
nerve
i
had
lately
shown
quint
well
there
continued
to
be
plenty
of
chance
for
nerve
on
the
eleventh
night
after
my
latest
encounter
with
that
gentlemanâ€”they
were
all
numbered
nowâ€”i
had
an
alarm
that
perilously
skirted
it
and
that
indeed
from
the
particular
quality
of
its
unexpectedness
proved
quite
my
sharpest
shock
it
was
precisely
the
first
night
during
this
series
that
weary
with
watching
i
had
felt
that
i
might
again
without
laxity
lay
myself
down
at
my
old
hour
i
slept
immediately
and
as
i
afterward
knew
till
about
one
oâ€™clock
but
when
i
woke
it
was
to
sit
straight
up
as
completely
roused
as
if
a
hand
had
shook
me
i
had
left
a
light
burning
but
it
was
now
out
and
i
felt
an
instant
certainty
that
flora
had
extinguished
it
this
brought
me
to
my
feet
and
straight
in
the
darkness
to
her
bed
which
i
found
she
had
left
a
glance
at
the
window
enlightened
me
further
and
the
striking
of
a
match
completed
the
picture
the
child
had
again
got
upâ€”this
time
blowing
out
the
taper
and
had
again
for
some
purpose
of
observation
or
response
squeezed
in
behind
the
blind
and
was
peering
out
into
the
night
that
she
now
sawâ€”as
she
had
not
i
had
satisfied
myself
the
previous
timeâ€”was
proved
to
me
by
the
fact
that
she
was
disturbed
neither
by
my
reillumination
nor
by
the
haste
i
made
to
get
into
slippers
and
into
a
wrap
hidden
protected
absorbed
she
evidently
rested
on
the
sillâ€”the
casement
opened
forwardâ€”and
gave
herself
up
there
was
a
great
still
moon
to
help
her
and
this
fact
had
counted
in
my
quick
decision
she
was
face
to
face
with
the
apparition
we
had
met
at
the
lake
and
could
now
communicate
with
it
as
she
had
not
then
been
able
to
do
what
i
on
my
side
had
to
care
for
was
without
disturbing
her
to
reach
from
the
corridor
some
other
window
in
the
same
quarter
i
got
to
the
door
without
her
hearing
me
i
got
out
of
it
closed
it
and
listened
from
the
other
side
for
some
sound
from
her
while
i
stood
in
the
passage
i
had
my
eyes
on
her
brotherâ€™s
door
which
was
but
ten
steps
off
and
which
indescribably
produced
in
me
a
renewal
of
the
strange
impulse
that
i
lately
spoke
of
as
my
temptation
what
if
i
should
go
straight
in
and
march
to
his
windowâ€”what
if
by
risking
to
his
boyish
bewilderment
a
revelation
of
my
motive
i
should
throw
across
the
rest
of
the
mystery
the
long
halter
of
my
boldness
this
thought
held
me
sufficiently
to
make
me
cross
to
his
threshold
and
pause
again
i
preternaturally
listened
i
figured
to
myself
what
might
portentously
be
i
wondered
if
his
bed
were
also
empty
and
he
too
were
secretly
at
watch
it
was
a
deep
soundless
minute
at
the
end
of
which
my
impulse
failed
he
was
quiet
he
might
be
innocent
the
risk
was
hideous
i
turned
away
there
was
a
figure
in
the
groundsâ€”a
figure
prowling
for
a
sight
the
visitor
with
whom
flora
was
engaged
but
it
was
not
the
visitor
most
concerned
with
my
boy
i
hesitated
afresh
but
on
other
grounds
and
only
for
a
few
seconds
then
i
had
made
my
choice
there
were
empty
rooms
at
bly
and
it
was
only
a
question
of
choosing
the
right
one
the
right
one
suddenly
presented
itself
to
me
as
the
lower
oneâ€”though
high
above
the
gardensâ€”in
the
solid
corner
of
the
house
that
i
have
spoken
of
as
the
old
tower
this
was
a
large
square
chamber
arranged
with
some
state
as
a
bedroom
the
extravagant
size
of
which
made
it
so
inconvenient
that
it
had
not
for
years
though
kept
by
mrs
grose
in
exemplary
order
been
occupied
i
had
often
admired
it
and
i
knew
my
way
about
in
it
i
had
only
after
just
faltering
at
the
first
chill
gloom
of
its
disuse
to
pass
across
it
and
unbolt
as
quietly
as
i
could
one
of
the
shutters
achieving
this
transit
i
uncovered
the
glass
without
a
sound
and
applying
my
face
to
the
pane
was
able
the
darkness
without
being
much
less
than
within
to
see
that
i
commanded
the
right
direction
then
i
saw
something
more
the
moon
made
the
night
extraordinarily
penetrable
and
showed
me
on
the
lawn
a
person
diminished
by
distance
who
stood
there
motionless
and
as
if
fascinated
looking
up
to
where
i
had
appearedâ€”looking
that
is
not
so
much
straight
at
me
as
at
something
that
was
apparently
above
me
there
was
clearly
another
person
above
meâ€”there
was
a
person
on
the
tower
but
the
presence
on
the
lawn
was
not
in
the
least
what
i
had
conceived
and
had
confidently
hurried
to
meet
the
presence
on
the
lawnâ€”i
felt
sick
as
i
made
it
outâ€”was
poor
little
miles
himself
xi
it
was
not
till
late
next
day
that
i
spoke
to
mrs
grose
the
rigor
with
which
i
kept
my
pupils
in
sight
making
it
often
difficult
to
meet
her
privately
and
the
more
as
we
each
felt
the
importance
of
not
provokingâ€”on
the
part
of
the
servants
quite
as
much
as
on
that
of
the
childrenâ€”any
suspicion
of
a
secret
flurry
or
that
of
a
discussion
of
mysteries
i
drew
a
great
security
in
this
particular
from
her
mere
smooth
aspect
there
was
nothing
in
her
fresh
face
to
pass
on
to
others
my
horrible
confidences
she
believed
me
i
was
sure
absolutely
if
she
hadnâ€™t
i
donâ€™t
know
what
would
have
become
of
me
for
i
couldnâ€™t
have
borne
the
business
alone
but
she
was
a
magnificent
monument
to
the
blessing
of
a
want
of
imagination
and
if
she
could
see
in
our
little
charges
nothing
but
their
beauty
and
amiability
their
happiness
and
cleverness
she
had
no
direct
communication
with
the
sources
of
my
trouble
if
they
had
been
at
all
visibly
blighted
or
battered
she
would
doubtless
have
grown
on
tracing
it
back
haggard
enough
to
match
them
as
matters
stood
however
i
could
feel
her
when
she
surveyed
them
with
her
large
white
arms
folded
and
the
habit
of
serenity
in
all
her
look
thank
the
lordâ€™s
mercy
that
if
they
were
ruined
the
pieces
would
still
serve
flights
of
fancy
gave
place
in
her
mind
to
a
steady
fireside
glow
and
i
had
already
begun
to
perceive
how
with
the
development
of
the
conviction
thatâ€”as
time
went
on
without
a
public
accidentâ€”our
young
things
could
after
all
look
out
for
themselves
she
addressed
her
greatest
solicitude
to
the
sad
case
presented
by
their
instructress
that
for
myself
was
a
sound
simplification
i
could
engage
that
to
the
world
my
face
should
tell
no
tales
but
it
would
have
been
in
the
conditions
an
immense
added
strain
to
find
myself
anxious
about
hers
at
the
hour
i
now
speak
of
she
had
joined
me
under
pressure
on
the
terrace
where
with
the
lapse
of
the
season
the
afternoon
sun
was
now
agreeable
and
we
sat
there
together
while
before
us
at
a
distance
but
within
call
if
we
wished
the
children
strolled
to
and
fro
in
one
of
their
most
manageable
moods
they
moved
slowly
in
unison
below
us
over
the
lawn
the
boy
as
they
went
reading
aloud
from
a
storybook
and
passing
his
arm
round
his
sister
to
keep
her
quite
in
touch
mrs
grose
watched
them
with
positive
placidity
then
i
caught
the
suppressed
intellectual
creak
with
which
she
conscientiously
turned
to
take
from
me
a
view
of
the
back
of
the
tapestry
i
had
made
her
a
receptacle
of
lurid
things
but
there
was
an
odd
recognition
of
my
superiorityâ€”my
accomplishments
and
my
functionâ€”in
her
patience
under
my
pain
she
offered
her
mind
to
my
disclosures
as
had
i
wished
to
mix
a
witchâ€™s
broth
and
proposed
it
with
assurance
she
would
have
held
out
a
large
clean
saucepan
this
had
become
thoroughly
her
attitude
by
the
time
that
in
my
recital
of
the
events
of
the
night
i
reached
the
point
of
what
miles
had
said
to
me
when
after
seeing
him
at
such
a
monstrous
hour
almost
on
the
very
spot
where
he
happened
now
to
be
i
had
gone
down
to
bring
him
in
choosing
then
at
the
window
with
a
concentrated
need
of
not
alarming
the
house
rather
that
method
than
a
signal
more
resonant
i
had
left
her
meanwhile
in
little
doubt
of
my
small
hope
of
representing
with
success
even
to
her
actual
sympathy
my
sense
of
the
real
splendor
of
the
little
inspiration
with
which
after
i
had
got
him
into
the
house
the
boy
met
my
final
articulate
challenge
as
soon
as
i
appeared
in
the
moonlight
on
the
terrace
he
had
come
to
me
as
straight
as
possible
on
which
i
had
taken
his
hand
without
a
word
and
led
him
through
the
dark
spaces
up
the
staircase
where
quint
had
so
hungrily
hovered
for
him
along
the
lobby
where
i
had
listened
and
trembled
and
so
to
his
forsaken
room
not
a
sound
on
the
way
had
passed
between
us
and
i
had
wonderedâ€”oh
how
i
had
wonderedâ€”if
he
were
groping
about
in
his
little
mind
for
something
plausible
and
not
too
grotesque
it
would
tax
his
invention
certainly
and
i
felt
this
time
over
his
real
embarrassment
a
curious
thrill
of
triumph
it
was
a
sharp
trap
for
the
inscrutable
he
couldnâ€™t
play
any
longer
at
innocence
so
how
the
deuce
would
he
get
out
of
it
there
beat
in
me
indeed
with
the
passionate
throb
of
this
question
an
equal
dumb
appeal
as
to
how
the
deuce
i
should
i
was
confronted
at
last
as
never
yet
with
all
the
risk
attached
even
now
to
sounding
my
own
horrid
note
i
remember
in
fact
that
as
we
pushed
into
his
little
chamber
where
the
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
at
all
and
the
window
uncovered
to
the
moonlight
made
the
place
so
clear
that
there
was
no
need
of
striking
a
matchâ€”i
remember
how
i
suddenly
dropped
sank
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
from
the
force
of
the
idea
that
he
must
know
how
he
really
as
they
say
â€œhadâ€
me
he
could
do
what
he
liked
with
all
his
cleverness
to
help
him
so
long
as
i
should
continue
to
defer
to
the
old
tradition
of
the
criminality
of
those
caretakers
of
the
young
who
minister
to
superstitions
and
fears
he
â€œhadâ€
me
indeed
and
in
a
cleft
stick
for
who
would
ever
absolve
me
who
would
consent
that
i
should
go
unhung
if
by
the
faintest
tremor
of
an
overture
i
were
the
first
to
introduce
into
our
perfect
intercourse
an
element
so
dire
no
no
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
convey
to
mrs
grose
just
as
it
is
scarcely
less
so
to
attempt
to
suggest
here
how
in
our
short
stiff
brush
in
the
dark
he
fairly
shook
me
with
admiration
i
was
of
course
thoroughly
kind
and
merciful
never
never
yet
had
i
placed
on
his
little
shoulders
hands
of
such
tenderness
as
those
with
which
while
i
rested
against
the
bed
i
held
him
there
well
under
fire
i
had
no
alternative
but
in
form
at
least
to
put
it
to
him
â€œyou
must
tell
me
nowâ€”and
all
the
truth
what
did
you
go
out
for
what
were
you
doing
thereâ€
i
can
still
see
his
wonderful
smile
the
whites
of
his
beautiful
eyes
and
the
uncovering
of
his
little
teeth
shine
to
me
in
the
dusk
â€œif
i
tell
you
why
will
you
understandâ€
my
heart
at
this
leaped
into
my
mouth
would
he
tell
me
why
i
found
no
sound
on
my
lips
to
press
it
and
i
was
aware
of
replying
only
with
a
vague
repeated
grimacing
nod
he
was
gentleness
itself
and
while
i
wagged
my
head
at
him
he
stood
there
more
than
ever
a
little
fairy
prince
it
was
his
brightness
indeed
that
gave
me
a
respite
would
it
be
so
great
if
he
were
really
going
to
tell
me
â€œwellâ€
he
said
at
last
â€œjust
exactly
in
order
that
you
should
do
thisâ€
â€œdo
whatâ€
â€œthink
meâ€”for
a
changeâ€”badâ€
i
shall
never
forget
the
sweetness
and
gaiety
with
which
he
brought
out
the
word
nor
how
on
top
of
it
he
bent
forward
and
kissed
me
it
was
practically
the
end
of
everything
i
met
his
kiss
and
i
had
to
make
while
i
folded
him
for
a
minute
in
my
arms
the
most
stupendous
effort
not
to
cry
he
had
given
exactly
the
account
of
himself
that
permitted
least
of
my
going
behind
it
and
it
was
only
with
the
effect
of
confirming
my
acceptance
of
it
that
as
i
presently
glanced
about
the
room
i
could
sayâ€”
â€œthen
you
didnâ€™t
undress
at
allâ€
he
fairly
glittered
in
the
gloom
â€œnot
at
all
i
sat
up
and
readâ€
â€œand
when
did
you
go
downâ€
â€œat
midnight
when
iâ€™m
bad
i
am
badâ€
â€œi
see
i
seeâ€”itâ€™s
charming
but
how
could
you
be
sure
i
would
know
itâ€
â€œoh
i
arranged
that
with
floraâ€
his
answers
rang
out
with
a
readiness
â€œshe
was
to
get
up
and
look
outâ€
â€œwhich
is
what
she
did
doâ€
it
was
i
who
fell
into
the
trap
â€œso
she
disturbed
you
and
to
see
what
she
was
looking
at
you
also
lookedâ€”you
sawâ€
â€œwhile
youâ€
i
concurred
â€œcaught
your
death
in
the
night
airâ€
he
literally
bloomed
so
from
this
exploit
that
he
could
afford
radiantly
to
assent
â€œhow
otherwise
should
i
have
been
bad
enoughâ€
he
asked
then
after
another
embrace
the
incident
and
our
interview
closed
on
my
recognition
of
all
the
reserves
of
goodness
that
for
his
joke
he
had
been
able
to
draw
upon
xii
the
particular
impression
i
had
received
proved
in
the
morning
light
i
repeat
not
quite
successfully
presentable
to
mrs
grose
though
i
reinforced
it
with
the
mention
of
still
another
remark
that
he
had
made
before
we
separated
â€œit
all
lies
in
half
a
dozen
wordsâ€
i
said
to
her
â€œwords
that
really
settle
the
matter
â€˜think
you
know
what
i
might
doâ€™
he
threw
that
off
to
show
me
how
good
he
is
he
knows
down
to
the
ground
what
he
â€˜mightâ€™
do
thatâ€™s
what
he
gave
them
a
taste
of
at
schoolâ€
â€œlord
you
do
changeâ€
cried
my
friend
â€œi
donâ€™t
changeâ€”i
simply
make
it
out
the
four
depend
upon
it
perpetually
meet
if
on
either
of
these
last
nights
you
had
been
with
either
child
you
would
clearly
have
understood
the
more
iâ€™ve
watched
and
waited
the
more
iâ€™ve
felt
that
if
there
were
nothing
else
to
make
it
sure
it
would
be
made
so
by
the
systematic
silence
of
each
never
by
a
slip
of
the
tongue
have
they
so
much
as
alluded
to
either
of
their
old
friends
any
more
than
miles
has
alluded
to
his
expulsion
oh
yes
we
may
sit
here
and
look
at
them
and
they
may
show
off
to
us
there
to
their
fill
but
even
while
they
pretend
to
be
lost
in
their
fairytale
theyâ€™re
steeped
in
their
vision
of
the
dead
restored
heâ€™s
not
reading
to
herâ€
i
declared
â€œtheyâ€™re
talking
of
themâ€”theyâ€™re
talking
horrors
i
go
on
i
know
as
if
i
were
crazy
and
itâ€™s
a
wonder
iâ€™m
not
what
iâ€™ve
seen
would
have
made
you
so
but
it
has
only
made
me
more
lucid
made
me
get
hold
of
still
other
thingsâ€
my
lucidity
must
have
seemed
awful
but
the
charming
creatures
who
were
victims
of
it
passing
and
repassing
in
their
interlocked
sweetness
gave
my
colleague
something
to
hold
on
by
and
i
felt
how
tight
she
held
as
without
stirring
in
the
breath
of
my
passion
she
covered
them
still
with
her
eyes
â€œof
what
other
things
have
you
got
holdâ€
â€œwhy
of
the
very
things
that
have
delighted
fascinated
and
yet
at
bottom
as
i
now
so
strangely
see
mystified
and
troubled
me
their
more
than
earthly
beauty
their
absolutely
unnatural
goodness
itâ€™s
a
gameâ€
i
went
on
â€œitâ€™s
a
policy
and
a
fraudâ€
â€œon
the
part
of
little
darlingsâ€”â€
â€œas
yet
mere
lovely
babies
yes
mad
as
that
seemsâ€
the
very
act
of
bringing
it
out
really
helped
me
to
trace
itâ€”follow
it
all
up
and
piece
it
all
together
â€œthey
havenâ€™t
been
goodâ€”theyâ€™ve
only
been
absent
it
has
been
easy
to
live
with
them
because
theyâ€™re
simply
leading
a
life
of
their
own
theyâ€™re
not
mineâ€”theyâ€™re
not
ours
theyâ€™re
his
and
theyâ€™re
hersâ€
â€œquintâ€™s
and
that
womanâ€™sâ€
â€œquintâ€™s
and
that
womanâ€™s
they
want
to
get
to
themâ€
oh
how
at
this
poor
mrs
grose
appeared
to
study
them
â€œbut
for
whatâ€
â€œfor
the
love
of
all
the
evil
that
in
those
dreadful
days
the
pair
put
into
them
and
to
ply
them
with
that
evil
still
to
keep
up
the
work
of
demons
is
what
brings
the
others
backâ€
â€œlawsâ€
said
my
friend
under
her
breath
the
exclamation
was
homely
but
it
revealed
a
real
acceptance
of
my
further
proof
of
what
in
the
bad
timeâ€”for
there
had
been
a
worse
even
than
thisâ€”must
have
occurred
there
could
have
been
no
such
justification
for
me
as
the
plain
assent
of
her
experience
to
whatever
depth
of
depravity
i
found
credible
in
our
brace
of
scoundrels
it
was
in
obvious
submission
of
memory
that
she
brought
out
after
a
moment
â€œthey
were
rascals
but
what
can
they
now
doâ€
she
pursued
â€œdoâ€
i
echoed
so
loud
that
miles
and
flora
as
they
passed
at
their
distance
paused
an
instant
in
their
walk
and
looked
at
us
â€œdonâ€™t
they
do
enoughâ€
i
demanded
in
a
lower
tone
while
the
children
having
smiled
and
nodded
and
kissed
hands
to
us
resumed
their
exhibition
we
were
held
by
it
a
minute
then
i
answered
â€œthey
can
destroy
themâ€
at
this
my
companion
did
turn
but
the
inquiry
she
launched
was
a
silent
one
the
effect
of
which
was
to
make
me
more
explicit
â€œthey
donâ€™t
know
as
yet
quite
howâ€”but
theyâ€™re
trying
hard
theyâ€™re
seen
only
across
as
it
were
and
beyondâ€”in
strange
places
and
on
high
places
the
top
of
towers
the
roof
of
houses
the
outside
of
windows
the
further
edge
of
pools
but
thereâ€™s
a
deep
design
on
either
side
to
shorten
the
distance
and
overcome
the
obstacle
and
the
success
of
the
tempters
is
only
a
question
of
time
theyâ€™ve
only
to
keep
to
their
suggestions
of
dangerâ€
â€œfor
the
children
to
comeâ€
â€œand
perish
in
the
attemptâ€
mrs
grose
slowly
got
up
and
i
scrupulously
added
â€œunless
of
course
we
can
preventâ€
standing
there
before
me
while
i
kept
my
seat
she
visibly
turned
things
over
â€œtheir
uncle
must
do
the
preventing
he
must
take
them
awayâ€
â€œand
whoâ€™s
to
make
himâ€
she
had
been
scanning
the
distance
but
she
now
dropped
on
me
a
foolish
face
â€œyou
missâ€
â€œby
writing
to
him
that
his
house
is
poisoned
and
his
little
nephew
and
niece
madâ€
â€œbut
if
they
are
missâ€
â€œand
if
i
am
myself
you
mean
thatâ€™s
charming
news
to
be
sent
him
by
a
governess
whose
prime
undertaking
was
to
give
him
no
worryâ€
mrs
grose
considered
following
the
children
again
â€œyes
he
do
hate
worry
that
was
the
great
reasonâ€”â€
â€œwhy
those
fiends
took
him
in
so
long
no
doubt
though
his
indifference
must
have
been
awful
as
iâ€™m
not
a
fiend
at
any
rate
i
shouldnâ€™t
take
him
inâ€
my
companion
after
an
instant
and
for
all
answer
sat
down
again
and
grasped
my
arm
â€œmake
him
at
any
rate
come
to
youâ€
i
stared
â€œto
meâ€
i
had
a
sudden
fear
of
what
she
might
do
â€œâ€˜himâ€™â€
â€œhe
ought
to
be
hereâ€”he
ought
to
helpâ€
i
quickly
rose
and
i
think
i
must
have
shown
her
a
queerer
face
than
ever
yet
â€œyou
see
me
asking
him
for
a
visitâ€
no
with
her
eyes
on
my
face
she
evidently
couldnâ€™t
instead
of
it
evenâ€”as
a
woman
reads
anotherâ€”she
could
see
what
i
myself
saw
his
derision
his
amusement
his
contempt
for
the
breakdown
of
my
resignation
at
being
left
alone
and
for
the
fine
machinery
i
had
set
in
motion
to
attract
his
attention
to
my
slighted
charms
she
didnâ€™t
knowâ€”no
one
knewâ€”how
proud
i
had
been
to
serve
him
and
to
stick
to
our
terms
yet
she
nonetheless
took
the
measure
i
think
of
the
warning
i
now
gave
her
â€œif
you
should
so
lose
your
head
as
to
appeal
to
him
for
meâ€”â€
she
was
really
frightened
â€œyes
missâ€
â€œi
would
leave
on
the
spot
both
him
and
youâ€
xiii
it
was
all
very
well
to
join
them
but
speaking
to
them
proved
quite
as
much
as
ever
an
effort
beyond
my
strengthâ€”offered
in
close
quarters
difficulties
as
insurmountable
as
before
this
situation
continued
a
month
and
with
new
aggravations
and
particular
notes
the
note
above
all
sharper
and
sharper
of
the
small
ironic
consciousness
on
the
part
of
my
pupils
it
was
not
i
am
as
sure
today
as
i
was
sure
then
my
mere
infernal
imagination
it
was
absolutely
traceable
that
they
were
aware
of
my
predicament
and
that
this
strange
relation
made
in
a
manner
for
a
long
time
the
air
in
which
we
moved
i
donâ€™t
mean
that
they
had
their
tongues
in
their
cheeks
or
did
anything
vulgar
for
that
was
not
one
of
their
dangers
i
do
mean
on
the
other
hand
that
the
element
of
the
unnamed
and
untouched
became
between
us
greater
than
any
other
and
that
so
much
avoidance
could
not
have
been
so
successfully
effected
without
a
great
deal
of
tacit
arrangement
it
was
as
if
at
moments
we
were
perpetually
coming
into
sight
of
subjects
before
which
we
must
stop
short
turning
suddenly
out
of
alleys
that
we
perceived
to
be
blind
closing
with
a
little
bang
that
made
us
look
at
each
otherâ€”for
like
all
bangs
it
was
something
louder
than
we
had
intendedâ€”the
doors
we
had
indiscreetly
opened
all
roads
lead
to
rome
and
there
were
times
when
it
might
have
struck
us
that
almost
every
branch
of
study
or
subject
of
conversation
skirted
forbidden
ground
forbidden
ground
was
the
question
of
the
return
of
the
dead
in
general
and
of
whatever
in
especial
might
survive
in
memory
of
the
friends
little
children
had
lost
there
were
days
when
i
could
have
sworn
that
one
of
them
had
with
a
small
invisible
nudge
said
to
the
other
â€œshe
thinks
sheâ€™ll
do
it
this
timeâ€”but
she
wonâ€™tâ€
to
â€œdo
itâ€
would
have
been
to
indulge
for
instanceâ€”and
for
once
in
a
wayâ€”in
some
direct
reference
to
the
lady
who
had
prepared
them
for
my
discipline
they
had
a
delightful
endless
appetite
for
passages
in
my
own
history
to
which
i
had
again
and
again
treated
them
they
were
in
possession
of
everything
that
had
ever
happened
to
me
had
had
with
every
circumstance
the
story
of
my
smallest
adventures
and
of
those
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
and
of
the
cat
and
the
dog
at
home
as
well
as
many
particulars
of
the
eccentric
nature
of
my
father
of
the
furniture
and
arrangement
of
our
house
and
of
the
conversation
of
the
old
women
of
our
village
there
were
things
enough
taking
one
with
another
to
chatter
about
if
one
went
very
fast
and
knew
by
instinct
when
to
go
round
they
pulled
with
an
art
of
their
own
the
strings
of
my
invention
and
my
memory
and
nothing
else
perhaps
when
i
thought
of
such
occasions
afterward
gave
me
so
the
suspicion
of
being
watched
from
under
cover
it
was
in
any
case
over
my
life
my
past
and
my
friends
alone
that
we
could
take
anything
like
our
easeâ€”a
state
of
affairs
that
led
them
sometimes
without
the
least
pertinence
to
break
out
into
sociable
reminders
i
was
invitedâ€”with
no
visible
connectionâ€”to
repeat
afresh
goody
goslingâ€™s
celebrated
mot
or
to
confirm
the
details
already
supplied
as
to
the
cleverness
of
the
vicarage
pony
it
was
partly
at
such
junctures
as
these
and
partly
at
quite
different
ones
that
with
the
turn
my
matters
had
now
taken
my
predicament
as
i
have
called
it
grew
most
sensible
the
fact
that
the
days
passed
for
me
without
another
encounter
ought
it
would
have
appeared
to
have
done
something
toward
soothing
my
nerves
since
the
light
brush
that
second
night
on
the
upper
landing
of
the
presence
of
a
woman
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
i
had
seen
nothing
whether
in
or
out
of
the
house
that
one
had
better
not
have
seen
there
was
many
a
corner
round
which
i
expected
to
come
upon
quint
and
many
a
situation
that
in
a
merely
sinister
way
would
have
favored
the
appearance
of
miss
jessel
the
summer
had
turned
the
summer
had
gone
the
autumn
had
dropped
upon
bly
and
had
blown
out
half
our
lights
the
place
with
its
gray
sky
and
withered
garlands
its
bared
spaces
and
scattered
dead
leaves
was
like
a
theater
after
the
performanceâ€”all
strewn
with
crumpled
playbills
there
were
exactly
states
of
the
air
conditions
of
sound
and
of
stillness
unspeakable
impressions
of
the
kind
of
ministering
moment
that
brought
back
to
me
long
enough
to
catch
it
the
feeling
of
the
medium
in
which
that
june
evening
out
of
doors
i
had
had
my
first
sight
of
quint
and
in
which
too
at
those
other
instants
i
had
after
seeing
him
through
the
window
looked
for
him
in
vain
in
the
circle
of
shrubbery
i
recognized
the
signs
the
portentsâ€”i
recognized
the
moment
the
spot
but
they
remained
unaccompanied
and
empty
and
i
continued
unmolested
if
unmolested
one
could
call
a
young
woman
whose
sensibility
had
in
the
most
extraordinary
fashion
not
declined
but
deepened
i
had
said
in
my
talk
with
mrs
grose
on
that
horrid
scene
of
floraâ€™s
by
the
lakeâ€”and
had
perplexed
her
by
so
sayingâ€”that
it
would
from
that
moment
distress
me
much
more
to
lose
my
power
than
to
keep
it
i
had
then
expressed
what
was
vividly
in
my
mind
the
truth
that
whether
the
children
really
saw
or
notâ€”since
that
is
it
was
not
yet
definitely
provedâ€”i
greatly
preferred
as
a
safeguard
the
fullness
of
my
own
exposure
i
was
ready
to
know
the
very
worst
that
was
to
be
known
what
i
had
then
had
an
ugly
glimpse
of
was
that
my
eyes
might
be
sealed
just
while
theirs
were
most
opened
well
my
eyes
were
sealed
it
appeared
at
presentâ€”a
consummation
for
which
it
seemed
blasphemous
not
to
thank
god
there
was
alas
a
difficulty
about
that
i
would
have
thanked
him
with
all
my
soul
had
i
not
had
in
a
proportionate
measure
this
conviction
of
the
secret
of
my
pupils
how
can
i
retrace
today
the
strange
steps
of
my
obsession
there
were
times
of
our
being
together
when
i
would
have
been
ready
to
swear
that
literally
in
my
presence
but
with
my
direct
sense
of
it
closed
they
had
visitors
who
were
known
and
were
welcome
then
it
was
that
had
i
not
been
deterred
by
the
very
chance
that
such
an
injury
might
prove
greater
than
the
injury
to
be
averted
my
exultation
would
have
broken
out
â€œtheyâ€™re
here
theyâ€™re
here
you
little
wretchesâ€
i
would
have
cried
â€œand
you
canâ€™t
deny
it
nowâ€
the
little
wretches
denied
it
with
all
the
added
volume
of
their
sociability
and
their
tenderness
in
just
the
crystal
depths
of
whichâ€”like
the
flash
of
a
fish
in
a
streamâ€”the
mockery
of
their
advantage
peeped
up
the
shock
in
truth
had
sunk
into
me
still
deeper
than
i
knew
on
the
night
when
looking
out
to
see
either
quint
or
miss
jessel
under
the
stars
i
had
beheld
the
boy
over
whose
rest
i
watched
and
who
had
immediately
brought
in
with
himâ€”had
straightway
there
turned
it
on
meâ€”the
lovely
upward
look
with
which
from
the
battlements
above
me
the
hideous
apparition
of
quint
had
played
if
it
was
a
question
of
a
scare
my
discovery
on
this
occasion
had
scared
me
more
than
any
other
and
it
was
in
the
condition
of
nerves
produced
by
it
that
i
made
my
actual
inductions
they
harassed
me
so
that
sometimes
at
odd
moments
i
shut
myself
up
audibly
to
rehearseâ€”it
was
at
once
a
fantastic
relief
and
a
renewed
despairâ€”the
manner
in
which
i
might
come
to
the
point
i
approached
it
from
one
side
and
the
other
while
in
my
room
i
flung
myself
about
but
i
always
broke
down
in
the
monstrous
utterance
of
names
as
they
died
away
on
my
lips
i
said
to
myself
that
i
should
indeed
help
them
to
represent
something
infamous
if
by
pronouncing
them
i
should
violate
as
rare
a
little
case
of
instinctive
delicacy
as
any
schoolroom
probably
had
ever
known
when
i
said
to
myself
â€œthey
have
the
manners
to
be
silent
and
you
trusted
as
you
are
the
baseness
to
speakâ€
i
felt
myself
crimson
and
i
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
after
these
secret
scenes
i
chattered
more
than
ever
going
on
volubly
enough
till
one
of
our
prodigious
palpable
hushes
occurredâ€”i
can
call
them
nothing
elseâ€”the
strange
dizzy
lift
or
swim
i
try
for
terms
into
a
stillness
a
pause
of
all
life
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
more
or
less
noise
that
at
the
moment
we
might
be
engaged
in
making
and
that
i
could
hear
through
any
deepened
exhilaration
or
quickened
recitation
or
louder
strum
of
the
piano
then
it
was
that
the
others
the
outsiders
were
there
though
they
were
not
angels
they
â€œpassedâ€
as
the
french
say
causing
me
while
they
stayed
to
tremble
with
the
fear
of
their
addressing
to
their
younger
victims
some
yet
more
infernal
message
or
more
vivid
image
than
they
had
thought
good
enough
for
myself
what
it
was
most
impossible
to
get
rid
of
was
the
cruel
idea
that
whatever
i
had
seen
miles
and
flora
saw
moreâ€”things
terrible
and
unguessable
and
that
sprang
from
dreadful
passages
of
intercourse
in
the
past
such
things
naturally
left
on
the
surface
for
the
time
a
chill
which
we
vociferously
denied
that
we
felt
and
we
had
all
three
with
repetition
got
into
such
splendid
training
that
we
went
each
time
almost
automatically
to
mark
the
close
of
the
incident
through
the
very
same
movements
it
was
striking
of
the
children
at
all
events
to
kiss
me
inveterately
with
a
kind
of
wild
irrelevance
and
never
to
failâ€”one
or
the
otherâ€”of
the
precious
question
that
had
helped
us
through
many
a
peril
â€œwhen
do
you
think
he
will
come
donâ€™t
you
think
we
ought
to
writeâ€â€”there
was
nothing
like
that
inquiry
we
found
by
experience
for
carrying
off
an
awkwardness
â€œheâ€
of
course
was
their
uncle
in
harley
street
and
we
lived
in
much
profusion
of
theory
that
he
might
at
any
moment
arrive
to
mingle
in
our
circle
it
was
impossible
to
have
given
less
encouragement
than
he
had
done
to
such
a
doctrine
but
if
we
had
not
had
the
doctrine
to
fall
back
upon
we
should
have
deprived
each
other
of
some
of
our
finest
exhibitions
he
never
wrote
to
themâ€”that
may
have
been
selfish
but
it
was
a
part
of
the
flattery
of
his
trust
of
me
for
the
way
in
which
a
man
pays
his
highest
tribute
to
a
woman
is
apt
to
be
but
by
the
more
festal
celebration
of
one
of
the
sacred
laws
of
his
comfort
and
i
held
that
i
carried
out
the
spirit
of
the
pledge
given
not
to
appeal
to
him
when
i
let
my
charges
understand
that
their
own
letters
were
but
charming
literary
exercises
they
were
too
beautiful
to
be
posted
i
kept
them
myself
i
have
them
all
to
this
hour
this
was
a
rule
indeed
which
only
added
to
the
satiric
effect
of
my
being
plied
with
the
supposition
that
he
might
at
any
moment
be
among
us
it
was
exactly
as
if
my
charges
knew
how
almost
more
awkward
than
anything
else
that
might
be
for
me
there
appears
to
me
moreover
as
i
look
back
no
note
in
all
this
more
extraordinary
than
the
mere
fact
that
in
spite
of
my
tension
and
of
their
triumph
i
never
lost
patience
with
them
adorable
they
must
in
truth
have
been
i
now
reflect
that
i
didnâ€™t
in
these
days
hate
them
would
exasperation
however
if
relief
had
longer
been
postponed
finally
have
betrayed
me
it
little
matters
for
relief
arrived
i
call
it
relief
though
it
was
only
the
relief
that
a
snap
brings
to
a
strain
or
the
burst
of
a
thunderstorm
to
a
day
of
suffocation
it
was
at
least
change
and
it
came
with
a
rush
xiv
walking
to
church
a
certain
sunday
morning
i
had
little
miles
at
my
side
and
his
sister
in
advance
of
us
and
at
mrs
groseâ€™s
well
in
sight
it
was
a
crisp
clear
day
the
first
of
its
order
for
some
time
the
night
had
brought
a
touch
of
frost
and
the
autumn
air
bright
and
sharp
made
the
church
bells
almost
gay
it
was
an
odd
accident
of
thought
that
i
should
have
happened
at
such
a
moment
to
be
particularly
and
very
gratefully
struck
with
the
obedience
of
my
little
charges
why
did
they
never
resent
my
inexorable
my
perpetual
society
something
or
other
had
brought
nearer
home
to
me
that
i
had
all
but
pinned
the
boy
to
my
shawl
and
that
in
the
way
our
companions
were
marshaled
before
me
i
might
have
appeared
to
provide
against
some
danger
of
rebellion
i
was
like
a
gaoler
with
an
eye
to
possible
surprises
and
escapes
but
all
this
belongedâ€”i
mean
their
magnificent
little
surrenderâ€”just
to
the
special
array
of
the
facts
that
were
most
abysmal
turned
out
for
sunday
by
his
uncleâ€™s
tailor
who
had
had
a
free
hand
and
a
notion
of
pretty
waistcoats
and
of
his
grand
little
air
milesâ€™s
whole
title
to
independence
the
rights
of
his
sex
and
situation
were
so
stamped
upon
him
that
if
he
had
suddenly
struck
for
freedom
i
should
have
had
nothing
to
say
i
was
by
the
strangest
of
chances
wondering
how
i
should
meet
him
when
the
revolution
unmistakably
occurred
i
call
it
a
revolution
because
i
now
see
how
with
the
word
he
spoke
the
curtain
rose
on
the
last
act
of
my
dreadful
drama
and
the
catastrophe
was
precipitated
â€œlook
here
my
dear
you
knowâ€
he
charmingly
said
â€œwhen
in
the
world
please
am
i
going
back
to
schoolâ€
transcribed
here
the
speech
sounds
harmless
enough
particularly
as
uttered
in
the
sweet
high
casual
pipe
with
which
at
all
interlocutors
but
above
all
at
his
eternal
governess
he
threw
off
intonations
as
if
he
were
tossing
roses
there
was
something
in
them
that
always
made
one
â€œcatchâ€
and
i
caught
at
any
rate
now
so
effectually
that
i
stopped
as
short
as
if
one
of
the
trees
of
the
park
had
fallen
across
the
road
there
was
something
new
on
the
spot
between
us
and
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
i
recognized
it
though
to
enable
me
to
do
so
he
had
no
need
to
look
a
whit
less
candid
and
charming
than
usual
i
could
feel
in
him
how
he
already
from
my
at
first
finding
nothing
to
reply
perceived
the
advantage
he
had
gained
i
was
so
slow
to
find
anything
that
he
had
plenty
of
time
after
a
minute
to
continue
with
his
suggestive
but
inconclusive
smile
â€œyou
know
my
dear
that
for
a
fellow
to
be
with
a
lady
alwaysâ€”â€
his
â€œmy
dearâ€
was
constantly
on
his
lips
for
me
and
nothing
could
have
expressed
more
the
exact
shade
of
the
sentiment
with
which
i
desired
to
inspire
my
pupils
than
its
fond
familiarity
it
was
so
respectfully
easy
but
oh
how
i
felt
that
at
present
i
must
pick
my
own
phrases
i
remember
that
to
gain
time
i
tried
to
laugh
and
i
seemed
to
see
in
the
beautiful
face
with
which
he
watched
me
how
ugly
and
queer
i
looked
â€œand
always
with
the
same
ladyâ€
i
returned
he
neither
blanched
nor
winked
the
whole
thing
was
virtually
out
between
us
â€œah
of
course
sheâ€™s
a
jolly
â€˜perfectâ€™
lady
but
after
all
iâ€™m
a
fellow
donâ€™t
you
see
thatâ€™sâ€”well
getting
onâ€
i
lingered
there
with
him
an
instant
ever
so
kindly
â€œyes
youâ€™re
getting
onâ€
oh
but
i
felt
helpless
i
have
kept
to
this
day
the
heartbreaking
little
idea
of
how
he
seemed
to
know
that
and
to
play
with
it
â€œand
you
canâ€™t
say
iâ€™ve
not
been
awfully
good
can
youâ€
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
for
though
i
felt
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
to
walk
on
i
was
not
yet
quite
able
â€œno
i
canâ€™t
say
that
milesâ€
â€œexcept
just
that
one
night
you
knowâ€”â€
â€œthat
one
nightâ€
i
couldnâ€™t
look
as
straight
as
he
â€œwhy
when
i
went
downâ€”went
out
of
the
houseâ€
â€œoh
yes
but
i
forget
what
you
did
it
forâ€
â€œyou
forgetâ€â€”he
spoke
with
the
sweet
extravagance
of
childish
reproach
â€œwhy
it
was
to
show
you
i
couldâ€
â€œoh
yes
you
couldâ€
â€œand
i
can
againâ€
i
felt
that
i
might
perhaps
after
all
succeed
in
keeping
my
wits
about
me
â€œcertainly
but
you
wonâ€™tâ€
â€œno
not
that
again
it
was
nothingâ€
â€œit
was
nothingâ€
i
said
â€œbut
we
must
go
onâ€
he
resumed
our
walk
with
me
passing
his
hand
into
my
arm
â€œthen
when
am
i
going
backâ€
i
wore
in
turning
it
over
my
most
responsible
air
â€œwere
you
very
happy
at
schoolâ€
he
just
considered
â€œoh
iâ€™m
happy
enough
anywhereâ€
â€œwell
thenâ€
i
quavered
â€œif
youâ€™re
just
as
happy
hereâ€”â€
â€œah
but
that
isnâ€™t
everything
of
course
you
know
a
lotâ€”â€
â€œbut
you
hint
that
you
know
almost
as
muchâ€
i
risked
as
he
paused
â€œnot
half
i
want
toâ€
miles
honestly
professed
â€œbut
it
isnâ€™t
so
much
thatâ€
â€œwhat
is
it
thenâ€
â€œwellâ€”i
want
to
see
more
lifeâ€
â€œi
see
i
seeâ€
we
had
arrived
within
sight
of
the
church
and
of
various
persons
including
several
of
the
household
of
bly
on
their
way
to
it
and
clustered
about
the
door
to
see
us
go
in
i
quickened
our
step
i
wanted
to
get
there
before
the
question
between
us
opened
up
much
further
i
reflected
hungrily
that
for
more
than
an
hour
he
would
have
to
be
silent
and
i
thought
with
envy
of
the
comparative
dusk
of
the
pew
and
of
the
almost
spiritual
help
of
the
hassock
on
which
i
might
bend
my
knees
i
seemed
literally
to
be
running
a
race
with
some
confusion
to
which
he
was
about
to
reduce
me
but
i
felt
that
he
had
got
in
first
when
before
we
had
even
entered
the
churchyard
he
threw
outâ€”
â€œi
want
my
own
sortâ€
it
literally
made
me
bound
forward
â€œthere
are
not
many
of
your
own
sort
milesâ€
i
laughed
â€œunless
perhaps
dear
little
floraâ€
â€œyou
really
compare
me
to
a
baby
girlâ€
this
found
me
singularly
weak
â€œdonâ€™t
you
then
love
our
sweet
floraâ€
â€œif
i
didnâ€™tâ€”and
you
too
if
i
didnâ€™tâ€”â€
he
repeated
as
if
retreating
for
a
jump
yet
leaving
his
thought
so
unfinished
that
after
we
had
come
into
the
gate
another
stop
which
he
imposed
on
me
by
the
pressure
of
his
arm
had
become
inevitable
mrs
grose
and
flora
had
passed
into
the
church
the
other
worshippers
had
followed
and
we
were
for
the
minute
alone
among
the
old
thick
graves
we
had
paused
on
the
path
from
the
gate
by
a
low
oblong
tablelike
tomb
â€œyes
if
you
didnâ€™tâ€”â€
he
looked
while
i
waited
at
the
graves
â€œwell
you
know
whatâ€
but
he
didnâ€™t
move
and
he
presently
produced
something
that
made
me
drop
straight
down
on
the
stone
slab
as
if
suddenly
to
rest
â€œdoes
my
uncle
think
what
you
thinkâ€
i
markedly
rested
â€œhow
do
you
know
what
i
thinkâ€
â€œah
well
of
course
i
donâ€™t
for
it
strikes
me
you
never
tell
me
but
i
mean
does
he
knowâ€
â€œknow
what
milesâ€
â€œwhy
the
way
iâ€™m
going
onâ€
i
perceived
quickly
enough
that
i
could
make
to
this
inquiry
no
answer
that
would
not
involve
something
of
a
sacrifice
of
my
employer
yet
it
appeared
to
me
that
we
were
all
at
bly
sufficiently
sacrificed
to
make
that
venial
â€œi
donâ€™t
think
your
uncle
much
caresâ€
miles
on
this
stood
looking
at
me
â€œthen
donâ€™t
you
think
he
can
be
made
toâ€
â€œin
what
wayâ€
â€œwhy
by
his
coming
downâ€
â€œbut
whoâ€™ll
get
him
to
come
downâ€
â€œi
willâ€
the
boy
said
with
extraordinary
brightness
and
emphasis
he
gave
me
another
look
charged
with
that
expression
and
then
marched
off
alone
into
church
xv
the
business
was
practically
settled
from
the
moment
i
never
followed
him
it
was
a
pitiful
surrender
to
agitation
but
my
being
aware
of
this
had
somehow
no
power
to
restore
me
i
only
sat
there
on
my
tomb
and
read
into
what
my
little
friend
had
said
to
me
the
fullness
of
its
meaning
by
the
time
i
had
grasped
the
whole
of
which
i
had
also
embraced
for
absence
the
pretext
that
i
was
ashamed
to
offer
my
pupils
and
the
rest
of
the
congregation
such
an
example
of
delay
what
i
said
to
myself
above
all
was
that
miles
had
got
something
out
of
me
and
that
the
proof
of
it
for
him
would
be
just
this
awkward
collapse
he
had
got
out
of
me
that
there
was
something
i
was
much
afraid
of
and
that
he
should
probably
be
able
to
make
use
of
my
fear
to
gain
for
his
own
purpose
more
freedom
my
fear
was
of
having
to
deal
with
the
intolerable
question
of
the
grounds
of
his
dismissal
from
school
for
that
was
really
but
the
question
of
the
horrors
gathered
behind
that
his
uncle
should
arrive
to
treat
with
me
of
these
things
was
a
solution
that
strictly
speaking
i
ought
now
to
have
desired
to
bring
on
but
i
could
so
little
face
the
ugliness
and
the
pain
of
it
that
i
simply
procrastinated
and
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
the
boy
to
my
deep
discomposure
was
immensely
in
the
right
was
in
a
position
to
say
to
me
â€œeither
you
clear
up
with
my
guardian
the
mystery
of
this
interruption
of
my
studies
or
you
cease
to
expect
me
to
lead
with
you
a
life
thatâ€™s
so
unnatural
for
a
boyâ€
what
was
so
unnatural
for
the
particular
boy
i
was
concerned
with
was
this
sudden
revelation
of
a
consciousness
and
a
plan
that
was
what
really
overcame
me
what
prevented
my
going
in
i
walked
round
the
church
hesitating
hovering
i
reflected
that
i
had
already
with
him
hurt
myself
beyond
repair
therefore
i
could
patch
up
nothing
and
it
was
too
extreme
an
effort
to
squeeze
beside
him
into
the
pew
he
would
be
so
much
more
sure
than
ever
to
pass
his
arm
into
mine
and
make
me
sit
there
for
an
hour
in
close
silent
contact
with
his
commentary
on
our
talk
for
the
first
minute
since
his
arrival
i
wanted
to
get
away
from
him
as
i
paused
beneath
the
high
east
window
and
listened
to
the
sounds
of
worship
i
was
taken
with
an
impulse
that
might
master
me
i
felt
completely
should
i
give
it
the
least
encouragement
i
might
easily
put
an
end
to
my
predicament
by
getting
away
altogether
here
was
my
chance
there
was
no
one
to
stop
me
i
could
give
the
whole
thing
upâ€”turn
my
back
and
retreat
it
was
only
a
question
of
hurrying
again
for
a
few
preparations
to
the
house
which
the
attendance
at
church
of
so
many
of
the
servants
would
practically
have
left
unoccupied
no
one
in
short
could
blame
me
if
i
should
just
drive
desperately
off
what
was
it
to
get
away
if
i
got
away
only
till
dinner
that
would
be
in
a
couple
of
hours
at
the
end
of
whichâ€”i
had
the
acute
previsionâ€”my
little
pupils
would
play
at
innocent
wonder
about
my
nonappearance
in
their
train
â€œwhat
did
you
do
you
naughty
bad
thing
why
in
the
world
to
worry
us
soâ€”and
take
our
thoughts
off
too
donâ€™t
you
knowâ€”did
you
desert
us
at
the
very
doorâ€
i
couldnâ€™t
meet
such
questions
nor
as
they
asked
them
their
false
little
lovely
eyes
yet
it
was
all
so
exactly
what
i
should
have
to
meet
that
as
the
prospect
grew
sharp
to
me
i
at
last
let
myself
go
i
got
so
far
as
the
immediate
moment
was
concerned
away
i
came
straight
out
of
the
churchyard
and
thinking
hard
retraced
my
steps
through
the
park
it
seemed
to
me
that
by
the
time
i
reached
the
house
i
had
made
up
my
mind
i
would
fly
the
sunday
stillness
both
of
the
approaches
and
of
the
interior
in
which
i
met
no
one
fairly
excited
me
with
a
sense
of
opportunity
were
i
to
get
off
quickly
this
way
i
should
get
off
without
a
scene
without
a
word
my
quickness
would
have
to
be
remarkable
however
and
the
question
of
a
conveyance
was
the
great
one
to
settle
tormented
in
the
hall
with
difficulties
and
obstacles
i
remember
sinking
down
at
the
foot
of
the
staircaseâ€”suddenly
collapsing
there
on
the
lowest
step
and
then
with
a
revulsion
recalling
that
it
was
exactly
where
more
than
a
month
before
in
the
darkness
of
night
and
just
so
bowed
with
evil
things
i
had
seen
the
specter
of
the
most
horrible
of
women
at
this
i
was
able
to
straighten
myself
i
went
the
rest
of
the
way
up
i
made
in
my
bewilderment
for
the
schoolroom
where
there
were
objects
belonging
to
me
that
i
should
have
to
take
but
i
opened
the
door
to
find
again
in
a
flash
my
eyes
unsealed
in
the
presence
of
what
i
saw
i
reeled
straight
back
upon
my
resistance
seated
at
my
own
table
in
clear
noonday
light
i
saw
a
person
whom
without
my
previous
experience
i
should
have
taken
at
the
first
blush
for
some
housemaid
who
might
have
stayed
at
home
to
look
after
the
place
and
who
availing
herself
of
rare
relief
from
observation
and
of
the
schoolroom
table
and
my
pens
ink
and
paper
had
applied
herself
to
the
considerable
effort
of
a
letter
to
her
sweetheart
there
was
an
effort
in
the
way
that
while
her
arms
rested
on
the
table
her
hands
with
evident
weariness
supported
her
head
but
at
the
moment
i
took
this
in
i
had
already
become
aware
that
in
spite
of
my
entrance
her
attitude
strangely
persisted
then
it
wasâ€”with
the
very
act
of
its
announcing
itselfâ€”that
her
identity
flared
up
in
a
change
of
posture
she
rose
not
as
if
she
had
heard
me
but
with
an
indescribable
grand
melancholy
of
indifference
and
detachment
and
within
a
dozen
feet
of
me
stood
there
as
my
vile
predecessor
dishonored
and
tragic
she
was
all
before
me
but
even
as
i
fixed
and
for
memory
secured
it
the
awful
image
passed
away
dark
as
midnight
in
her
black
dress
her
haggard
beauty
and
her
unutterable
woe
she
had
looked
at
me
long
enough
to
appear
to
say
that
her
right
to
sit
at
my
table
was
as
good
as
mine
to
sit
at
hers
while
these
instants
lasted
indeed
i
had
the
extraordinary
chill
of
feeling
that
it
was
i
who
was
the
intruder
it
was
as
a
wild
protest
against
it
that
actually
addressing
herâ€”â€œyou
terrible
miserable
womanâ€â€”i
heard
myself
break
into
a
sound
that
by
the
open
door
rang
through
the
long
passage
and
the
empty
house
she
looked
at
me
as
if
she
heard
me
but
i
had
recovered
myself
and
cleared
the
air
there
was
nothing
in
the
room
the
next
minute
but
the
sunshine
and
a
sense
that
i
must
stay
xvi
i
had
so
perfectly
expected
that
the
return
of
my
pupils
would
be
marked
by
a
demonstration
that
i
was
freshly
upset
at
having
to
take
into
account
that
they
were
dumb
about
my
absence
instead
of
gaily
denouncing
and
caressing
me
they
made
no
allusion
to
my
having
failed
them
and
i
was
left
for
the
time
on
perceiving
that
she
too
said
nothing
to
study
mrs
groseâ€™s
odd
face
i
did
this
to
such
purpose
that
i
made
sure
they
had
in
some
way
bribed
her
to
silence
a
silence
that
however
i
would
engage
to
break
down
on
the
first
private
opportunity
this
opportunity
came
before
tea
i
secured
five
minutes
with
her
in
the
housekeeperâ€™s
room
where
in
the
twilight
amid
a
smell
of
lately
baked
bread
but
with
the
place
all
swept
and
garnished
i
found
her
sitting
in
pained
placidity
before
the
fire
so
i
see
her
still
so
i
see
her
best
facing
the
flame
from
her
straight
chair
in
the
dusky
shining
room
a
large
clean
image
of
the
â€œput
awayâ€â€”of
drawers
closed
and
locked
and
rest
without
a
remedy
â€œoh
yes
they
asked
me
to
say
nothing
and
to
please
themâ€”so
long
as
they
were
thereâ€”of
course
i
promised
but
what
had
happened
to
youâ€
â€œi
only
went
with
you
for
the
walkâ€
i
said
â€œi
had
then
to
come
back
to
meet
a
friendâ€
she
showed
her
surprise
â€œa
friendâ€”youâ€
â€œoh
yes
i
have
a
coupleâ€
i
laughed
â€œbut
did
the
children
give
you
a
reasonâ€
â€œfor
not
alluding
to
your
leaving
us
yes
they
said
you
would
like
it
better
do
you
like
it
betterâ€
my
face
had
made
her
rueful
â€œno
i
like
it
worseâ€
but
after
an
instant
i
added
â€œdid
they
say
why
i
should
like
it
betterâ€
â€œno
master
miles
only
said
â€˜we
must
do
nothing
but
what
she
likesâ€™â€
â€œi
wish
indeed
he
would
and
what
did
flora
sayâ€
â€œmiss
flora
was
too
sweet
she
said
â€˜oh
of
course
of
courseâ€™â€”and
i
said
the
sameâ€
i
thought
a
moment
â€œyou
were
too
sweet
tooâ€”i
can
hear
you
all
but
nonetheless
between
miles
and
me
itâ€™s
now
all
outâ€
â€œall
outâ€
my
companion
stared
â€œbut
what
missâ€
â€œeverything
it
doesnâ€™t
matter
iâ€™ve
made
up
my
mind
i
came
home
my
dearâ€
i
went
on
â€œfor
a
talk
with
miss
jesselâ€
i
had
by
this
time
formed
the
habit
of
having
mrs
grose
literally
well
in
hand
in
advance
of
my
sounding
that
note
so
that
even
now
as
she
bravely
blinked
under
the
signal
of
my
word
i
could
keep
her
comparatively
firm
â€œa
talk
do
you
mean
she
spokeâ€
â€œit
came
to
that
i
found
her
on
my
return
in
the
schoolroomâ€
â€œand
what
did
she
sayâ€
i
can
hear
the
good
woman
still
and
the
candor
of
her
stupefaction
â€œthat
she
suffers
the
tormentsâ€”â€
it
was
this
of
a
truth
that
made
her
as
she
filled
out
my
picture
gape
â€œdo
you
meanâ€
she
faltered
â€œâ€”of
the
lostâ€
â€œof
the
lost
of
the
damned
and
thatâ€™s
why
to
share
themâ€”â€
i
faltered
myself
with
the
horror
of
it
but
my
companion
with
less
imagination
kept
me
up
â€œto
share
themâ€”â€
â€œshe
wants
floraâ€
mrs
grose
might
as
i
gave
it
to
her
fairly
have
fallen
away
from
me
had
i
not
been
prepared
i
still
held
her
there
to
show
i
was
â€œas
iâ€™ve
told
you
however
it
doesnâ€™t
matterâ€
â€œbecause
youâ€™ve
made
up
your
mind
but
to
whatâ€
â€œto
everythingâ€
â€œand
what
do
you
call
â€˜everythingâ€™â€
â€œwhy
sending
for
their
uncleâ€
â€œoh
miss
in
pity
doâ€
my
friend
broke
out
â€œah
but
i
will
i
will
i
see
itâ€™s
the
only
way
whatâ€™s
â€˜outâ€™
as
i
told
you
with
miles
is
that
if
he
thinks
iâ€™m
afraid
toâ€”and
has
ideas
of
what
he
gains
by
thatâ€”he
shall
see
heâ€™s
mistaken
yes
yes
his
uncle
shall
have
it
here
from
me
on
the
spot
and
before
the
boy
himself
if
necessary
that
if
iâ€™m
to
be
reproached
with
having
done
nothing
again
about
more
schoolâ€”â€
â€œyes
missâ€”â€
my
companion
pressed
me
â€œwell
thereâ€™s
that
awful
reasonâ€
there
were
now
clearly
so
many
of
these
for
my
poor
colleague
that
she
was
excusable
for
being
vague
â€œbutâ€”aâ€”whichâ€
â€œwhy
the
letter
from
his
old
placeâ€
â€œyouâ€™ll
show
it
to
the
masterâ€
â€œi
ought
to
have
done
so
on
the
instantâ€
â€œoh
noâ€
said
mrs
grose
with
decision
â€œiâ€™ll
put
it
before
himâ€
i
went
on
inexorably
â€œthat
i
canâ€™t
undertake
to
work
the
question
on
behalf
of
a
child
who
has
been
expelledâ€”â€
â€œfor
weâ€™ve
never
in
the
least
known
whatâ€
mrs
grose
declared
â€œfor
wickedness
for
what
elseâ€”when
heâ€™s
so
clever
and
beautiful
and
perfect
is
he
stupid
is
he
untidy
is
he
infirm
is
he
ill-natured
heâ€™s
exquisiteâ€”so
it
can
be
only
that
and
that
would
open
up
the
whole
thing
after
allâ€
i
said
â€œitâ€™s
their
uncleâ€™s
fault
if
he
left
here
such
peopleâ€”â€
â€œhe
didnâ€™t
really
in
the
least
know
them
the
faultâ€™s
mineâ€
she
had
turned
quite
pale
â€œwell
you
shanâ€™t
sufferâ€
i
answered
â€œthe
children
shanâ€™tâ€
she
emphatically
returned
i
was
silent
awhile
we
looked
at
each
other
â€œthen
what
am
i
to
tell
himâ€
â€œyou
neednâ€™t
tell
him
anything
iâ€™ll
tell
himâ€
i
measured
this
â€œdo
you
mean
youâ€™ll
writeâ€”â€
remembering
she
couldnâ€™t
i
caught
myself
up
â€œhow
do
you
communicateâ€
â€œi
tell
the
bailiff
he
writesâ€
â€œand
should
you
like
him
to
write
our
storyâ€
my
question
had
a
sarcastic
force
that
i
had
not
fully
intended
and
it
made
her
after
a
moment
inconsequently
break
down
the
tears
were
again
in
her
eyes
â€œah
miss
you
writeâ€
â€œwellâ€”tonightâ€
i
at
last
answered
and
on
this
we
separated
xvii
i
went
so
far
in
the
evening
as
to
make
a
beginning
the
weather
had
changed
back
a
great
wind
was
abroad
and
beneath
the
lamp
in
my
room
with
flora
at
peace
beside
me
i
sat
for
a
long
time
before
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
and
listened
to
the
lash
of
the
rain
and
the
batter
of
the
gusts
finally
i
went
out
taking
a
candle
i
crossed
the
passage
and
listened
a
minute
at
milesâ€™s
door
what
under
my
endless
obsession
i
had
been
impelled
to
listen
for
was
some
betrayal
of
his
not
being
at
rest
and
i
presently
caught
one
but
not
in
the
form
i
had
expected
his
voice
tinkled
out
â€œi
say
you
thereâ€”come
inâ€
it
was
a
gaiety
in
the
gloom
i
went
in
with
my
light
and
found
him
in
bed
very
wide
awake
but
very
much
at
his
ease
â€œwell
what
are
you
up
toâ€
he
asked
with
a
grace
of
sociability
in
which
it
occurred
to
me
that
mrs
grose
had
she
been
present
might
have
looked
in
vain
for
proof
that
anything
was
â€œoutâ€
i
stood
over
him
with
my
candle
â€œhow
did
you
know
i
was
thereâ€
â€œwhy
of
course
i
heard
you
did
you
fancy
you
made
no
noise
youâ€™re
like
a
troop
of
cavalryâ€
he
beautifully
laughed
â€œthen
you
werenâ€™t
asleepâ€
â€œnot
much
i
lie
awake
and
thinkâ€
i
had
put
my
candle
designedly
a
short
way
off
and
then
as
he
held
out
his
friendly
old
hand
to
me
had
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
â€œwhat
is
itâ€
i
asked
â€œthat
you
think
ofâ€
â€œwhat
in
the
world
my
dear
but
youâ€
â€œah
the
pride
i
take
in
your
appreciation
doesnâ€™t
insist
on
that
i
had
so
far
rather
you
sleptâ€
â€œwell
i
think
also
you
know
of
this
queer
business
of
oursâ€
i
marked
the
coolness
of
his
firm
little
hand
â€œof
what
queer
business
milesâ€
â€œwhy
the
way
you
bring
me
up
and
all
the
restâ€
i
fairly
held
my
breath
a
minute
and
even
from
my
glimmering
taper
there
was
light
enough
to
show
how
he
smiled
up
at
me
from
his
pillow
â€œwhat
do
you
mean
by
all
the
restâ€
â€œoh
you
know
you
knowâ€
i
could
say
nothing
for
a
minute
though
i
felt
as
i
held
his
hand
and
our
eyes
continued
to
meet
that
my
silence
had
all
the
air
of
admitting
his
charge
and
that
nothing
in
the
whole
world
of
reality
was
perhaps
at
that
moment
so
fabulous
as
our
actual
relation
â€œcertainly
you
shall
go
back
to
schoolâ€
i
said
â€œif
it
be
that
that
troubles
you
but
not
to
the
old
placeâ€”we
must
find
another
a
better
how
could
i
know
it
did
trouble
you
this
question
when
you
never
told
me
so
never
spoke
of
it
at
allâ€
his
clear
listening
face
framed
in
its
smooth
whiteness
made
him
for
the
minute
as
appealing
as
some
wistful
patient
in
a
childrenâ€™s
hospital
and
i
would
have
given
as
the
resemblance
came
to
me
all
i
possessed
on
earth
really
to
be
the
nurse
or
the
sister
of
charity
who
might
have
helped
to
cure
him
well
even
as
it
was
i
perhaps
might
help
â€œdo
you
know
youâ€™ve
never
said
a
word
to
me
about
your
schoolâ€”i
mean
the
old
one
never
mentioned
it
in
any
wayâ€
he
seemed
to
wonder
he
smiled
with
the
same
loveliness
but
he
clearly
gained
time
he
waited
he
called
for
guidance
â€œhavenâ€™t
iâ€
it
wasnâ€™t
for
me
to
help
himâ€”it
was
for
the
thing
i
had
met
something
in
his
tone
and
the
expression
of
his
face
as
i
got
this
from
him
set
my
heart
aching
with
such
a
pang
as
it
had
never
yet
known
so
unutterably
touching
was
it
to
see
his
little
brain
puzzled
and
his
little
resources
taxed
to
play
under
the
spell
laid
on
him
a
part
of
innocence
and
consistency
â€œno
neverâ€”from
the
hour
you
came
back
youâ€™ve
never
mentioned
to
me
one
of
your
masters
one
of
your
comrades
nor
the
least
little
thing
that
ever
happened
to
you
at
school
never
little
milesâ€”no
neverâ€”have
you
given
me
an
inkling
of
anything
that
may
have
happened
there
therefore
you
can
fancy
how
much
iâ€™m
in
the
dark
until
you
came
out
that
way
this
morning
you
had
since
the
first
hour
i
saw
you
scarce
even
made
a
reference
to
anything
in
your
previous
life
you
seemed
so
perfectly
to
accept
the
presentâ€
it
was
extraordinary
how
my
absolute
conviction
of
his
secret
precocity
or
whatever
i
might
call
the
poison
of
an
influence
that
i
dared
but
half
to
phrase
made
him
in
spite
of
the
faint
breath
of
his
inward
trouble
appear
as
accessible
as
an
older
personâ€”imposed
him
almost
as
an
intellectual
equal
â€œi
thought
you
wanted
to
go
on
as
you
areâ€
it
struck
me
that
at
this
he
just
faintly
colored
he
gave
at
any
rate
like
a
convalescent
slightly
fatigued
a
languid
shake
of
his
head
â€œi
donâ€™tâ€”i
donâ€™t
i
want
to
get
awayâ€
â€œyouâ€™re
tired
of
blyâ€
â€œoh
no
i
like
blyâ€
â€œwell
thenâ€”â€
â€œoh
you
know
what
a
boy
wantsâ€
i
felt
that
i
didnâ€™t
know
so
well
as
miles
and
i
took
temporary
refuge
â€œyou
want
to
go
to
your
uncleâ€
again
at
this
with
his
sweet
ironic
face
he
made
a
movement
on
the
pillow
â€œah
you
canâ€™t
get
off
with
thatâ€
i
was
silent
a
little
and
it
was
i
now
i
think
who
changed
color
â€œmy
dear
i
donâ€™t
want
to
get
offâ€
â€œyou
canâ€™t
even
if
you
do
you
canâ€™t
you
canâ€™tâ€â€”he
lay
beautifully
staring
â€œmy
uncle
must
come
down
and
you
must
completely
settle
thingsâ€
â€œif
we
doâ€
i
returned
with
some
spirit
â€œyou
may
be
sure
it
will
be
to
take
you
quite
awayâ€
â€œwell
donâ€™t
you
understand
that
thatâ€™s
exactly
what
iâ€™m
working
for
youâ€™ll
have
to
tell
himâ€”about
the
way
youâ€™ve
let
it
all
drop
youâ€™ll
have
to
tell
him
a
tremendous
lotâ€
the
exultation
with
which
he
uttered
this
helped
me
somehow
for
the
instant
to
meet
him
rather
more
â€œand
how
much
will
you
miles
have
to
tell
him
there
are
things
heâ€™ll
ask
youâ€
he
turned
it
over
â€œvery
likely
but
what
thingsâ€
â€œthe
things
youâ€™ve
never
told
me
to
make
up
his
mind
what
to
do
with
you
he
canâ€™t
send
you
backâ€”â€
â€œoh
i
donâ€™t
want
to
go
backâ€
he
broke
in
â€œi
want
a
new
fieldâ€
he
said
it
with
admirable
serenity
with
positive
unimpeachable
gaiety
and
doubtless
it
was
that
very
note
that
most
evoked
for
me
the
poignancy
the
unnatural
childish
tragedy
of
his
probable
reappearance
at
the
end
of
three
months
with
all
this
bravado
and
still
more
dishonor
it
overwhelmed
me
now
that
i
should
never
be
able
to
bear
that
and
it
made
me
let
myself
go
i
threw
myself
upon
him
and
in
the
tenderness
of
my
pity
i
embraced
him
â€œdear
little
miles
dear
little
milesâ€”â€
my
face
was
close
to
his
and
he
let
me
kiss
him
simply
taking
it
with
indulgent
good
humor
â€œwell
old
ladyâ€
â€œis
there
nothingâ€”nothing
at
all
that
you
want
to
tell
meâ€
he
turned
off
a
little
facing
round
toward
the
wall
and
holding
up
his
hand
to
look
at
as
one
had
seen
sick
children
look
â€œiâ€™ve
told
youâ€”i
told
you
this
morningâ€
oh
i
was
sorry
for
him
â€œthat
you
just
want
me
not
to
worry
youâ€
he
looked
round
at
me
now
as
if
in
recognition
of
my
understanding
him
then
ever
so
gently
â€œto
let
me
aloneâ€
he
replied
there
was
even
a
singular
little
dignity
in
it
something
that
made
me
release
him
yet
when
i
had
slowly
risen
linger
beside
him
god
knows
i
never
wished
to
harass
him
but
i
felt
that
merely
at
this
to
turn
my
back
on
him
was
to
abandon
or
to
put
it
more
truly
to
lose
him
â€œiâ€™ve
just
begun
a
letter
to
your
uncleâ€
i
said
â€œwell
then
finish
itâ€
i
waited
a
minute
â€œwhat
happened
beforeâ€
he
gazed
up
at
me
again
â€œbefore
whatâ€
â€œbefore
you
came
back
and
before
you
went
awayâ€
for
some
time
he
was
silent
but
he
continued
to
meet
my
eyes
â€œwhat
happenedâ€
it
made
me
the
sound
of
the
words
in
which
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
caught
for
the
very
first
time
a
small
faint
quaver
of
consenting
consciousnessâ€”it
made
me
drop
on
my
knees
beside
the
bed
and
seize
once
more
the
chance
of
possessing
him
â€œdear
little
miles
dear
little
miles
if
you
knew
how
i
want
to
help
you
itâ€™s
only
that
itâ€™s
nothing
but
that
and
iâ€™d
rather
die
than
give
you
a
pain
or
do
you
a
wrongâ€”iâ€™d
rather
die
than
hurt
a
hair
of
you
dear
little
milesâ€â€”oh
i
brought
it
out
now
even
if
i
should
go
too
farâ€”â€œi
just
want
you
to
help
me
to
save
youâ€
but
i
knew
in
a
moment
after
this
that
i
had
gone
too
far
the
answer
to
my
appeal
was
instantaneous
but
it
came
in
the
form
of
an
extraordinary
blast
and
chill
a
gust
of
frozen
air
and
a
shake
of
the
room
as
great
as
if
in
the
wild
wind
the
casement
had
crashed
in
the
boy
gave
a
loud
high
shriek
which
lost
in
the
rest
of
the
shock
of
sound
might
have
seemed
indistinctly
though
i
was
so
close
to
him
a
note
either
of
jubilation
or
of
terror
i
jumped
to
my
feet
again
and
was
conscious
of
darkness
so
for
a
moment
we
remained
while
i
stared
about
me
and
saw
that
the
drawn
curtains
were
unstirred
and
the
window
tight
â€œwhy
the
candleâ€™s
outâ€
i
then
cried
â€œit
was
i
who
blew
it
dearâ€
said
miles
xviii
the
next
day
after
lessons
mrs
grose
found
a
moment
to
say
to
me
quietly
â€œhave
you
written
missâ€
â€œyesâ€”iâ€™ve
writtenâ€
but
i
didnâ€™t
addâ€”for
the
hourâ€”that
my
letter
sealed
and
directed
was
still
in
my
pocket
there
would
be
time
enough
to
send
it
before
the
messenger
should
go
to
the
village
meanwhile
there
had
been
on
the
part
of
my
pupils
no
more
brilliant
more
exemplary
morning
it
was
exactly
as
if
they
had
both
had
at
heart
to
gloss
over
any
recent
little
friction
they
performed
the
dizziest
feats
of
arithmetic
soaring
quite
out
of
my
feeble
range
and
perpetrated
in
higher
spirits
than
ever
geographical
and
historical
jokes
it
was
conspicuous
of
course
in
miles
in
particular
that
he
appeared
to
wish
to
show
how
easily
he
could
let
me
down
this
child
to
my
memory
really
lives
in
a
setting
of
beauty
and
misery
that
no
words
can
translate
there
was
a
distinction
all
his
own
in
every
impulse
he
revealed
never
was
a
small
natural
creature
to
the
uninitiated
eye
all
frankness
and
freedom
a
more
ingenious
a
more
extraordinary
little
gentleman
i
had
perpetually
to
guard
against
the
wonder
of
contemplation
into
which
my
initiated
view
betrayed
me
to
check
the
irrelevant
gaze
and
discouraged
sigh
in
which
i
constantly
both
attacked
and
renounced
the
enigma
of
what
such
a
little
gentleman
could
have
done
that
deserved
a
penalty
say
that
by
the
dark
prodigy
i
knew
the
imagination
of
all
evil
had
been
opened
up
to
him
all
the
justice
within
me
ached
for
the
proof
that
it
could
ever
have
flowered
into
an
act
he
had
never
at
any
rate
been
such
a
little
gentleman
as
when
after
our
early
dinner
on
this
dreadful
day
he
came
round
to
me
and
asked
if
i
shouldnâ€™t
like
him
for
half
an
hour
to
play
to
me
david
playing
to
saul
could
never
have
shown
a
finer
sense
of
the
occasion
it
was
literally
a
charming
exhibition
of
tact
of
magnanimity
and
quite
tantamount
to
his
saying
outright
â€œthe
true
knights
we
love
to
read
about
never
push
an
advantage
too
far
i
know
what
you
mean
now
you
mean
thatâ€”to
be
let
alone
yourself
and
not
followed
upâ€”youâ€™ll
cease
to
worry
and
spy
upon
me
wonâ€™t
keep
me
so
close
to
you
will
let
me
go
and
come
well
i
â€˜comeâ€™
you
seeâ€”but
i
donâ€™t
go
thereâ€™ll
be
plenty
of
time
for
that
i
do
really
delight
in
your
society
and
i
only
want
to
show
you
that
i
contended
for
a
principleâ€
it
may
be
imagined
whether
i
resisted
this
appeal
or
failed
to
accompany
him
again
hand
in
hand
to
the
schoolroom
he
sat
down
at
the
old
piano
and
played
as
he
had
never
played
and
if
there
are
those
who
think
he
had
better
have
been
kicking
a
football
i
can
only
say
that
i
wholly
agree
with
them
for
at
the
end
of
a
time
that
under
his
influence
i
had
quite
ceased
to
measure
i
started
up
with
a
strange
sense
of
having
literally
slept
at
my
post
it
was
after
luncheon
and
by
the
schoolroom
fire
and
yet
i
hadnâ€™t
really
in
the
least
slept
i
had
only
done
something
much
worseâ€”i
had
forgotten
where
all
this
time
was
flora
when
i
put
the
question
to
miles
he
played
on
a
minute
before
answering
and
then
could
only
say
â€œwhy
my
dear
how
do
i
knowâ€â€”breaking
moreover
into
a
happy
laugh
which
immediately
after
as
if
it
were
a
vocal
accompaniment
he
prolonged
into
incoherent
extravagant
song
i
went
straight
to
my
room
but
his
sister
was
not
there
then
before
going
downstairs
i
looked
into
several
others
as
she
was
nowhere
about
she
would
surely
be
with
mrs
grose
whom
in
the
comfort
of
that
theory
i
accordingly
proceeded
in
quest
of
i
found
her
where
i
had
found
her
the
evening
before
but
she
met
my
quick
challenge
with
blank
scared
ignorance
she
had
only
supposed
that
after
the
repast
i
had
carried
off
both
the
children
as
to
which
she
was
quite
in
her
right
for
it
was
the
very
first
time
i
had
allowed
the
little
girl
out
of
my
sight
without
some
special
provision
of
course
now
indeed
she
might
be
with
the
maids
so
that
the
immediate
thing
was
to
look
for
her
without
an
air
of
alarm
this
we
promptly
arranged
between
us
but
when
ten
minutes
later
and
in
pursuance
of
our
arrangement
we
met
in
the
hall
it
was
only
to
report
on
either
side
that
after
guarded
inquiries
we
had
altogether
failed
to
trace
her
for
a
minute
there
apart
from
observation
we
exchanged
mute
alarms
and
i
could
feel
with
what
high
interest
my
friend
returned
me
all
those
i
had
from
the
first
given
her
â€œsheâ€™ll
be
aboveâ€
she
presently
saidâ€”â€œin
one
of
the
rooms
you
havenâ€™t
searchedâ€
â€œno
sheâ€™s
at
a
distanceâ€
i
had
made
up
my
mind
â€œshe
has
gone
outâ€
mrs
grose
stared
â€œwithout
a
hatâ€
i
naturally
also
looked
volumes
â€œisnâ€™t
that
woman
always
without
oneâ€
â€œsheâ€™s
with
herâ€
â€œsheâ€™s
with
herâ€
i
declared
â€œwe
must
find
themâ€
my
hand
was
on
my
friendâ€™s
arm
but
she
failed
for
the
moment
confronted
with
such
an
account
of
the
matter
to
respond
to
my
pressure
she
communed
on
the
contrary
on
the
spot
with
her
uneasiness
â€œand
whereâ€™s
master
milesâ€
â€œoh
heâ€™s
with
quint
theyâ€™re
in
the
schoolroomâ€
â€œlord
missâ€
my
view
i
was
myself
awareâ€”and
therefore
i
suppose
my
toneâ€”had
never
yet
reached
so
calm
an
assurance
â€œthe
trickâ€™s
playedâ€
i
went
on
â€œtheyâ€™ve
successfully
worked
their
plan
he
found
the
most
divine
little
way
to
keep
me
quiet
while
she
went
offâ€
â€œâ€˜divineâ€™â€
mrs
grose
bewilderedly
echoed
â€œinfernal
thenâ€
i
almost
cheerfully
rejoined
â€œhe
has
provided
for
himself
as
well
but
comeâ€
she
had
helplessly
gloomed
at
the
upper
regions
â€œyou
leave
himâ€”â€
â€œso
long
with
quint
yesâ€”i
donâ€™t
mind
that
nowâ€
she
always
ended
at
these
moments
by
getting
possession
of
my
hand
and
in
this
manner
she
could
at
present
still
stay
me
but
after
gasping
an
instant
at
my
sudden
resignation
â€œbecause
of
your
letterâ€
she
eagerly
brought
out
i
quickly
by
way
of
answer
felt
for
my
letter
drew
it
forth
held
it
up
and
then
freeing
myself
went
and
laid
it
on
the
great
hall
table
â€œluke
will
take
itâ€
i
said
as
i
came
back
i
reached
the
house
door
and
opened
it
i
was
already
on
the
steps
my
companion
still
demurred
the
storm
of
the
night
and
the
early
morning
had
dropped
but
the
afternoon
was
damp
and
gray
i
came
down
to
the
drive
while
she
stood
in
the
doorway
â€œyou
go
with
nothing
onâ€
â€œwhat
do
i
care
when
the
child
has
nothing
i
canâ€™t
wait
to
dressâ€
i
cried
â€œand
if
you
must
do
so
i
leave
you
try
meanwhile
yourself
upstairsâ€
â€œwith
themâ€
oh
on
this
the
poor
woman
promptly
joined
me
xix
we
went
straight
to
the
lake
as
it
was
called
at
bly
and
i
daresay
rightly
called
though
i
reflect
that
it
may
in
fact
have
been
a
sheet
of
water
less
remarkable
than
it
appeared
to
my
untraveled
eyes
my
acquaintance
with
sheets
of
water
was
small
and
the
pool
of
bly
at
all
events
on
the
few
occasions
of
my
consenting
under
the
protection
of
my
pupils
to
affront
its
surface
in
the
old
flat-bottomed
boat
moored
there
for
our
use
had
impressed
me
both
with
its
extent
and
its
agitation
the
usual
place
of
embarkation
was
half
a
mile
from
the
house
but
i
had
an
intimate
conviction
that
wherever
flora
might
be
she
was
not
near
home
she
had
not
given
me
the
slip
for
any
small
adventure
and
since
the
day
of
the
very
great
one
that
i
had
shared
with
her
by
the
pond
i
had
been
aware
in
our
walks
of
the
quarter
to
which
she
most
inclined
this
was
why
i
had
now
given
to
mrs
groseâ€™s
steps
so
marked
a
directionâ€”a
direction
that
made
her
when
she
perceived
it
oppose
a
resistance
that
showed
me
she
was
freshly
mystified
â€œyouâ€™re
going
to
the
water
missâ€”you
think
sheâ€™s
inâ€”â€
â€œshe
may
be
though
the
depth
is
i
believe
nowhere
very
great
but
what
i
judge
most
likely
is
that
sheâ€™s
on
the
spot
from
which
the
other
day
we
saw
together
what
i
told
youâ€
â€œwhen
she
pretended
not
to
seeâ€”â€
â€œwith
that
astounding
self-possession
iâ€™ve
always
been
sure
she
wanted
to
go
back
alone
and
now
her
brother
has
managed
it
for
herâ€
mrs
grose
still
stood
where
she
had
stopped
â€œyou
suppose
they
really
talk
of
themâ€
â€œi
could
meet
this
with
a
confidence
they
say
things
that
if
we
heard
them
would
simply
appall
usâ€
â€œand
if
she
is
thereâ€”â€
â€œyesâ€
â€œthen
miss
jessel
isâ€
â€œbeyond
a
doubt
you
shall
seeâ€
â€œoh
thank
youâ€
my
friend
cried
planted
so
firm
that
taking
it
in
i
went
straight
on
without
her
by
the
time
i
reached
the
pool
however
she
was
close
behind
me
and
i
knew
that
whatever
to
her
apprehension
might
befall
me
the
exposure
of
my
society
struck
her
as
her
least
danger
she
exhaled
a
moan
of
relief
as
we
at
last
came
in
sight
of
the
greater
part
of
the
water
without
a
sight
of
the
child
there
was
no
trace
of
flora
on
that
nearer
side
of
the
bank
where
my
observation
of
her
had
been
most
startling
and
none
on
the
opposite
edge
where
save
for
a
margin
of
some
twenty
yards
a
thick
copse
came
down
to
the
water
the
pond
oblong
in
shape
had
a
width
so
scant
compared
to
its
length
that
with
its
ends
out
of
view
it
might
have
been
taken
for
a
scant
river
we
looked
at
the
empty
expanse
and
then
i
felt
the
suggestion
of
my
friendâ€™s
eyes
i
knew
what
she
meant
and
i
replied
with
a
negative
headshake
â€œno
no
wait
she
has
taken
the
boatâ€
my
companion
stared
at
the
vacant
mooring
place
and
then
again
across
the
lake
â€œthen
where
is
itâ€
â€œour
not
seeing
it
is
the
strongest
of
proofs
she
has
used
it
to
go
over
and
then
has
managed
to
hide
itâ€
â€œall
aloneâ€”that
childâ€
â€œsheâ€™s
not
alone
and
at
such
times
sheâ€™s
not
a
child
sheâ€™s
an
old
old
womanâ€
i
scanned
all
the
visible
shore
while
mrs
grose
took
again
into
the
queer
element
i
offered
her
one
of
her
plunges
of
submission
then
i
pointed
out
that
the
boat
might
perfectly
be
in
a
small
refuge
formed
by
one
of
the
recesses
of
the
pool
an
indentation
masked
for
the
hither
side
by
a
projection
of
the
bank
and
by
a
clump
of
trees
growing
close
to
the
water
â€œbut
if
the
boatâ€™s
there
where
on
earthâ€™s
sheâ€
my
colleague
anxiously
asked
â€œthatâ€™s
exactly
what
we
must
learnâ€
and
i
started
to
walk
further
â€œby
going
all
the
way
roundâ€
â€œcertainly
far
as
it
is
it
will
take
us
but
ten
minutes
but
itâ€™s
far
enough
to
have
made
the
child
prefer
not
to
walk
she
went
straight
overâ€
â€œlawsâ€
cried
my
friend
again
the
chain
of
my
logic
was
ever
too
much
for
her
it
dragged
her
at
my
heels
even
now
and
when
we
had
got
halfway
roundâ€”a
devious
tiresome
process
on
ground
much
broken
and
by
a
path
choked
with
overgrowthâ€”i
paused
to
give
her
breath
i
sustained
her
with
a
grateful
arm
assuring
her
that
she
might
hugely
help
me
and
this
started
us
afresh
so
that
in
the
course
of
but
few
minutes
more
we
reached
a
point
from
which
we
found
the
boat
to
be
where
i
had
supposed
it
it
had
been
intentionally
left
as
much
as
possible
out
of
sight
and
was
tied
to
one
of
the
stakes
of
a
fence
that
came
just
there
down
to
the
brink
and
that
had
been
an
assistance
to
disembarking
i
recognized
as
i
looked
at
the
pair
of
short
thick
oars
quite
safely
drawn
up
the
prodigious
character
of
the
feat
for
a
little
girl
but
i
had
lived
by
this
time
too
long
among
wonders
and
had
panted
to
too
many
livelier
measures
there
was
a
gate
in
the
fence
through
which
we
passed
and
that
brought
us
after
a
trifling
interval
more
into
the
open
then
â€œthere
she
isâ€
we
both
exclaimed
at
once
flora
a
short
way
off
stood
before
us
on
the
grass
and
smiled
as
if
her
performance
was
now
complete
the
next
thing
she
did
however
was
to
stoop
straight
down
and
pluckâ€”quite
as
if
it
were
all
she
was
there
forâ€”a
big
ugly
spray
of
withered
fern
i
instantly
became
sure
she
had
just
come
out
of
the
copse
she
waited
for
us
not
herself
taking
a
step
and
i
was
conscious
of
the
rare
solemnity
with
which
we
presently
approached
her
she
smiled
and
smiled
and
we
met
but
it
was
all
done
in
a
silence
by
this
time
flagrantly
ominous
mrs
grose
was
the
first
to
break
the
spell
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
and
drawing
the
child
to
her
breast
clasped
in
a
long
embrace
the
little
tender
yielding
body
while
this
dumb
convulsion
lasted
i
could
only
watch
itâ€”which
i
did
the
more
intently
when
i
saw
floraâ€™s
face
peep
at
me
over
our
companionâ€™s
shoulder
it
was
serious
nowâ€”the
flicker
had
left
it
but
it
strengthened
the
pang
with
which
i
at
that
moment
envied
mrs
grose
the
simplicity
of
her
relation
still
all
this
while
nothing
more
passed
between
us
save
that
flora
had
let
her
foolish
fern
again
drop
to
the
ground
what
she
and
i
had
virtually
said
to
each
other
was
that
pretexts
were
useless
now
when
mrs
grose
finally
got
up
she
kept
the
childâ€™s
hand
so
that
the
two
were
still
before
me
and
the
singular
reticence
of
our
communion
was
even
more
marked
in
the
frank
look
she
launched
me
â€œiâ€™ll
be
hangedâ€
it
said
â€œif
iâ€™ll
speakâ€
it
was
flora
who
gazing
all
over
me
in
candid
wonder
was
the
first
she
was
struck
with
our
bareheaded
aspect
â€œwhy
where
are
your
thingsâ€
â€œwhere
yours
are
my
dearâ€
i
promptly
returned
she
had
already
got
back
her
gaiety
and
appeared
to
take
this
as
an
answer
quite
sufficient
â€œand
whereâ€™s
milesâ€
she
went
on
there
was
something
in
the
small
valor
of
it
that
quite
finished
me
these
three
words
from
her
were
in
a
flash
like
the
glitter
of
a
drawn
blade
the
jostle
of
the
cup
that
my
hand
for
weeks
and
weeks
had
held
high
and
full
to
the
brim
that
now
even
before
speaking
i
felt
overflow
in
a
deluge
â€œiâ€™ll
tell
you
if
youâ€™ll
tell
meâ€”â€
i
heard
myself
say
then
heard
the
tremor
in
which
it
broke
â€œwell
whatâ€
mrs
groseâ€™s
suspense
blazed
at
me
but
it
was
too
late
now
and
i
brought
the
thing
out
handsomely
â€œwhere
my
pet
is
miss
jesselâ€
xx
just
as
in
the
churchyard
with
miles
the
whole
thing
was
upon
us
much
as
i
had
made
of
the
fact
that
this
name
had
never
once
between
us
been
sounded
the
quick
smitten
glare
with
which
the
childâ€™s
face
now
received
it
fairly
likened
my
breach
of
the
silence
to
the
smash
of
a
pane
of
glass
it
added
to
the
interposing
cry
as
if
to
stay
the
blow
that
mrs
grose
at
the
same
instant
uttered
over
my
violenceâ€”the
shriek
of
a
creature
scared
or
rather
wounded
which
in
turn
within
a
few
seconds
was
completed
by
a
gasp
of
my
own
i
seized
my
colleagueâ€™s
arm
â€œsheâ€™s
there
sheâ€™s
thereâ€
miss
jessel
stood
before
us
on
the
opposite
bank
exactly
as
she
had
stood
the
other
time
and
i
remember
strangely
as
the
first
feeling
now
produced
in
me
my
thrill
of
joy
at
having
brought
on
a
proof
she
was
there
and
i
was
justified
she
was
there
and
i
was
neither
cruel
nor
mad
she
was
there
for
poor
scared
mrs
grose
but
she
was
there
most
for
flora
and
no
moment
of
my
monstrous
time
was
perhaps
so
extraordinary
as
that
in
which
i
consciously
threw
out
to
herâ€”with
the
sense
that
pale
and
ravenous
demon
as
she
was
she
would
catch
and
understand
itâ€”an
inarticulate
message
of
gratitude
she
rose
erect
on
the
spot
my
friend
and
i
had
lately
quitted
and
there
was
not
in
all
the
long
reach
of
her
desire
an
inch
of
her
evil
that
fell
short
this
first
vividness
of
vision
and
emotion
were
things
of
a
few
seconds
during
which
mrs
groseâ€™s
dazed
blink
across
to
where
i
pointed
struck
me
as
a
sovereign
sign
that
she
too
at
last
saw
just
as
it
carried
my
own
eyes
precipitately
to
the
child
the
revelation
then
of
the
manner
in
which
flora
was
affected
startled
me
in
truth
far
more
than
it
would
have
done
to
find
her
also
merely
agitated
for
direct
dismay
was
of
course
not
what
i
had
expected
prepared
and
on
her
guard
as
our
pursuit
had
actually
made
her
she
would
repress
every
betrayal
and
i
was
therefore
shaken
on
the
spot
by
my
first
glimpse
of
the
particular
one
for
which
i
had
not
allowed
to
see
her
without
a
convulsion
of
her
small
pink
face
not
even
feign
to
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
prodigy
i
announced
but
only
instead
of
that
turn
at
me
an
expression
of
hard
still
gravity
an
expression
absolutely
new
and
unprecedented
and
that
appeared
to
read
and
accuse
and
judge
meâ€”this
was
a
stroke
that
somehow
converted
the
little
girl
herself
into
the
very
presence
that
could
make
me
quail
i
quailed
even
though
my
certitude
that
she
thoroughly
saw
was
never
greater
than
at
that
instant
and
in
the
immediate
need
to
defend
myself
i
called
it
passionately
to
witness
â€œsheâ€™s
there
you
little
unhappy
thingâ€”there
there
there
and
you
see
her
as
well
as
you
see
meâ€
i
had
said
shortly
before
to
mrs
grose
that
she
was
not
at
these
times
a
child
but
an
old
old
woman
and
that
description
of
her
could
not
have
been
more
strikingly
confirmed
than
in
the
way
in
which
for
all
answer
to
this
she
simply
showed
me
without
a
concession
an
admission
of
her
eyes
a
countenance
of
deeper
and
deeper
of
indeed
suddenly
quite
fixed
reprobation
i
was
by
this
timeâ€”if
i
can
put
the
whole
thing
at
all
togetherâ€”more
appalled
at
what
i
may
properly
call
her
manner
than
at
anything
else
though
it
was
simultaneously
with
this
that
i
became
aware
of
having
mrs
grose
also
and
very
formidably
to
reckon
with
my
elder
companion
the
next
moment
at
any
rate
blotted
out
everything
but
her
own
flushed
face
and
her
loud
shocked
protest
a
burst
of
high
disapproval
â€œwhat
a
dreadful
turn
to
be
sure
miss
where
on
earth
do
you
see
anythingâ€
i
could
only
grasp
her
more
quickly
yet
for
even
while
she
spoke
the
hideous
plain
presence
stood
undimmed
and
undaunted
it
had
already
lasted
a
minute
and
it
lasted
while
i
continued
seizing
my
colleague
quite
thrusting
her
at
it
and
presenting
her
to
it
to
insist
with
my
pointing
hand
â€œyou
donâ€™t
see
her
exactly
as
we
seeâ€”you
mean
to
say
you
donâ€™t
nowâ€”now
sheâ€™s
as
big
as
a
blazing
fire
only
look
dearest
woman
lookâ€”â€
she
looked
even
as
i
did
and
gave
me
with
her
deep
groan
of
negation
repulsion
compassionâ€”the
mixture
with
her
pity
of
her
relief
at
her
exemptionâ€”a
sense
touching
to
me
even
then
that
she
would
have
backed
me
up
if
she
could
i
might
well
have
needed
that
for
with
this
hard
blow
of
the
proof
that
her
eyes
were
hopelessly
sealed
i
felt
my
own
situation
horribly
crumble
i
feltâ€”i
sawâ€”my
livid
predecessor
press
from
her
position
on
my
defeat
and
i
was
conscious
more
than
all
of
what
i
should
have
from
this
instant
to
deal
with
in
the
astounding
little
attitude
of
flora
into
this
attitude
mrs
grose
immediately
and
violently
entered
breaking
even
while
there
pierced
through
my
sense
of
ruin
a
prodigious
private
triumph
into
breathless
reassurance
â€œshe
isnâ€™t
there
little
lady
and
nobodyâ€™s
thereâ€”and
you
never
see
nothing
my
sweet
how
can
poor
miss
jesselâ€”when
poor
miss
jesselâ€™s
dead
and
buried
we
know
donâ€™t
we
loveâ€â€”and
she
appealed
blundering
in
to
the
child
â€œitâ€™s
all
a
mere
mistake
and
a
worry
and
a
jokeâ€”and
weâ€™ll
go
home
as
fast
as
we
canâ€
our
companion
on
this
had
responded
with
a
strange
quick
primness
of
propriety
and
they
were
again
with
mrs
grose
on
her
feet
united
as
it
were
in
pained
opposition
to
me
flora
continued
to
fix
me
with
her
small
mask
of
reprobation
and
even
at
that
minute
i
prayed
god
to
forgive
me
for
seeming
to
see
that
as
she
stood
there
holding
tight
to
our
friendâ€™s
dress
her
incomparable
childish
beauty
had
suddenly
failed
had
quite
vanished
iâ€™ve
said
it
alreadyâ€”she
was
literally
she
was
hideously
hard
she
had
turned
common
and
almost
ugly
â€œi
donâ€™t
know
what
you
mean
i
see
nobody
i
see
nothing
i
never
have
i
think
youâ€™re
cruel
i
donâ€™t
like
youâ€
then
after
this
deliverance
which
might
have
been
that
of
a
vulgarly
pert
little
girl
in
the
street
she
hugged
mrs
grose
more
closely
and
buried
in
her
skirts
the
dreadful
little
face
in
this
position
she
produced
an
almost
furious
wail
â€œtake
me
away
take
me
awayâ€”oh
take
me
away
from
herâ€
â€œfrom
meâ€
i
panted
â€œfrom
youâ€”from
youâ€
she
cried
even
mrs
grose
looked
across
at
me
dismayed
while
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
communicate
again
with
the
figure
that
on
the
opposite
bank
without
a
movement
as
rigidly
still
as
if
catching
beyond
the
interval
our
voices
was
as
vividly
there
for
my
disaster
as
it
was
not
there
for
my
service
the
wretched
child
had
spoken
exactly
as
if
she
had
got
from
some
outside
source
each
of
her
stabbing
little
words
and
i
could
therefore
in
the
full
despair
of
all
i
had
to
accept
but
sadly
shake
my
head
at
her
â€œif
i
had
ever
doubted
all
my
doubt
would
at
present
have
gone
iâ€™ve
been
living
with
the
miserable
truth
and
now
it
has
only
too
much
closed
round
me
of
course
iâ€™ve
lost
you
iâ€™ve
interfered
and
youâ€™ve
seenâ€”under
her
dictationâ€â€”with
which
i
faced
over
the
pool
again
our
infernal
witnessâ€”â€œthe
easy
and
perfect
way
to
meet
it
iâ€™ve
done
my
best
but
iâ€™ve
lost
you
goodbyeâ€
for
mrs
grose
i
had
an
imperative
an
almost
frantic
â€œgo
goâ€
before
which
in
infinite
distress
but
mutely
possessed
of
the
little
girl
and
clearly
convinced
in
spite
of
her
blindness
that
something
awful
had
occurred
and
some
collapse
engulfed
us
she
retreated
by
the
way
we
had
come
as
fast
as
she
could
move
of
what
first
happened
when
i
was
left
alone
i
had
no
subsequent
memory
i
only
knew
that
at
the
end
of
i
suppose
a
quarter
of
an
hour
an
odorous
dampness
and
roughness
chilling
and
piercing
my
trouble
had
made
me
understand
that
i
must
have
thrown
myself
on
my
face
on
the
ground
and
given
way
to
a
wildness
of
grief
i
must
have
lain
there
long
and
cried
and
sobbed
for
when
i
raised
my
head
the
day
was
almost
done
i
got
up
and
looked
a
moment
through
the
twilight
at
the
gray
pool
and
its
blank
haunted
edge
and
then
i
took
back
to
the
house
my
dreary
and
difficult
course
when
i
reached
the
gate
in
the
fence
the
boat
to
my
surprise
was
gone
so
that
i
had
a
fresh
reflection
to
make
on
floraâ€™s
extraordinary
command
of
the
situation
she
passed
that
night
by
the
most
tacit
and
i
should
add
were
not
the
word
so
grotesque
a
false
note
the
happiest
of
arrangements
with
mrs
grose
i
saw
neither
of
them
on
my
return
but
on
the
other
hand
as
by
an
ambiguous
compensation
i
saw
a
great
deal
of
miles
i
sawâ€”i
can
use
no
other
phraseâ€”so
much
of
him
that
it
was
as
if
it
were
more
than
it
had
ever
been
no
evening
i
had
passed
at
bly
had
the
portentous
quality
of
this
one
in
spite
of
whichâ€”and
in
spite
also
of
the
deeper
depths
of
consternation
that
had
opened
beneath
my
feetâ€”there
was
literally
in
the
ebbing
actual
an
extraordinarily
sweet
sadness
on
reaching
the
house
i
had
never
so
much
as
looked
for
the
boy
i
had
simply
gone
straight
to
my
room
to
change
what
i
was
wearing
and
to
take
in
at
a
glance
much
material
testimony
to
floraâ€™s
rupture
her
little
belongings
had
all
been
removed
when
later
by
the
schoolroom
fire
i
was
served
with
tea
by
the
usual
maid
i
indulged
on
the
article
of
my
other
pupil
in
no
inquiry
whatever
he
had
his
freedom
nowâ€”he
might
have
it
to
the
end
well
he
did
have
it
and
it
consistedâ€”in
part
at
leastâ€”of
his
coming
in
at
about
eight
oâ€™clock
and
sitting
down
with
me
in
silence
on
the
removal
of
the
tea
things
i
had
blown
out
the
candles
and
drawn
my
chair
closer
i
was
conscious
of
a
mortal
coldness
and
felt
as
if
i
should
never
again
be
warm
so
when
he
appeared
i
was
sitting
in
the
glow
with
my
thoughts
he
paused
a
moment
by
the
door
as
if
to
look
at
me
thenâ€”as
if
to
share
themâ€”came
to
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
and
sank
into
a
chair
we
sat
there
in
absolute
stillness
yet
he
wanted
i
felt
to
be
with
me
xxi
before
a
new
day
in
my
room
had
fully
broken
my
eyes
opened
to
mrs
grose
who
had
come
to
my
bedside
with
worse
news
flora
was
so
markedly
feverish
that
an
illness
was
perhaps
at
hand
she
had
passed
a
night
of
extreme
unrest
a
night
agitated
above
all
by
fears
that
had
for
their
subject
not
in
the
least
her
former
but
wholly
her
present
governess
it
was
not
against
the
possible
re-entrance
of
miss
jessel
on
the
scene
that
she
protestedâ€”it
was
conspicuously
and
passionately
against
mine
i
was
promptly
on
my
feet
of
course
and
with
an
immense
deal
to
ask
the
more
that
my
friend
had
discernibly
now
girded
her
loins
to
meet
me
once
more
this
i
felt
as
soon
as
i
had
put
to
her
the
question
of
her
sense
of
the
childâ€™s
sincerity
as
against
my
own
â€œshe
persists
in
denying
to
you
that
she
saw
or
has
ever
seen
anythingâ€
my
visitorâ€™s
trouble
truly
was
great
â€œah
miss
it
isnâ€™t
a
matter
on
which
i
can
push
her
yet
it
isnâ€™t
either
i
must
say
as
if
i
much
needed
to
it
has
made
her
every
inch
of
her
quite
oldâ€
â€œoh
i
see
her
perfectly
from
here
she
resents
for
all
the
world
like
some
high
little
personage
the
imputation
on
her
truthfulness
and
as
it
were
her
respectability
â€˜miss
jessel
indeedâ€”sheâ€™
ah
sheâ€™s
â€˜respectableâ€™
the
chit
the
impression
she
gave
me
there
yesterday
was
i
assure
you
the
very
strangest
of
all
it
was
quite
beyond
any
of
the
others
i
did
put
my
foot
in
it
sheâ€™ll
never
speak
to
me
againâ€
hideous
and
obscure
as
it
all
was
it
held
mrs
grose
briefly
silent
then
she
granted
my
point
with
a
frankness
which
i
made
sure
had
more
behind
it
â€œi
think
indeed
miss
she
never
will
she
do
have
a
grand
manner
about
itâ€
â€œand
that
mannerâ€â€”i
summed
it
upâ€”â€œis
practically
whatâ€™s
the
matter
with
her
nowâ€
oh
that
manner
i
could
see
in
my
visitorâ€™s
face
and
not
a
little
else
besides
â€œshe
asks
me
every
three
minutes
if
i
think
youâ€™re
coming
inâ€
â€œi
seeâ€”i
seeâ€
i
too
on
my
side
had
so
much
more
than
worked
it
out
â€œhas
she
said
to
you
since
yesterdayâ€”except
to
repudiate
her
familiarity
with
anything
so
dreadfulâ€”a
single
other
word
about
miss
jesselâ€
â€œnot
one
miss
and
of
course
you
knowâ€
my
friend
added
â€œi
took
it
from
her
by
the
lake
that
just
then
and
there
at
least
there
was
nobodyâ€
â€œrather
and
naturally
you
take
it
from
her
stillâ€
â€œi
donâ€™t
contradict
her
what
else
can
i
doâ€
â€œnothing
in
the
world
youâ€™ve
the
cleverest
little
person
to
deal
with
theyâ€™ve
made
themâ€”their
two
friends
i
meanâ€”still
cleverer
even
than
nature
did
for
it
was
wondrous
material
to
play
on
flora
has
now
her
grievance
and
sheâ€™ll
work
it
to
the
endâ€
â€œyes
miss
but
to
what
endâ€
â€œwhy
that
of
dealing
with
me
to
her
uncle
sheâ€™ll
make
me
out
to
him
the
lowest
creatureâ€”â€
i
winced
at
the
fair
show
of
the
scene
in
mrs
groseâ€™s
face
she
looked
for
a
minute
as
if
she
sharply
saw
them
together
â€œand
him
who
thinks
so
well
of
youâ€
â€œhe
has
an
odd
wayâ€”it
comes
over
me
nowâ€
i
laughed
â€œâ€”of
proving
it
but
that
doesnâ€™t
matter
what
flora
wants
of
course
is
to
get
rid
of
meâ€
my
companion
bravely
concurred
â€œnever
again
to
so
much
as
look
at
youâ€
â€œso
that
what
youâ€™ve
come
to
me
now
forâ€
i
asked
â€œis
to
speed
me
on
my
wayâ€
before
she
had
time
to
reply
however
i
had
her
in
check
â€œiâ€™ve
a
better
ideaâ€”the
result
of
my
reflections
my
going
would
seem
the
right
thing
and
on
sunday
i
was
terribly
near
it
yet
that
wonâ€™t
do
itâ€™s
you
who
must
go
you
must
take
floraâ€
my
visitor
at
this
did
speculate
â€œbut
where
in
the
worldâ€”â€
â€œaway
from
here
away
from
them
away
even
most
of
all
now
from
me
straight
to
her
uncleâ€
â€œonly
to
tell
on
youâ€”â€
â€œno
not
â€˜onlyâ€™
to
leave
me
in
addition
with
my
remedyâ€
she
was
still
vague
â€œand
what
is
your
remedyâ€
â€œyour
loyalty
to
begin
with
and
then
milesâ€™sâ€
she
looked
at
me
hard
â€œdo
you
think
heâ€”â€
â€œwonâ€™t
if
he
has
the
chance
turn
on
me
yes
i
venture
still
to
think
it
at
all
events
i
want
to
try
get
off
with
his
sister
as
soon
as
possible
and
leave
me
with
him
aloneâ€
i
was
amazed
myself
at
the
spirit
i
had
still
in
reserve
and
therefore
perhaps
a
trifle
the
more
disconcerted
at
the
way
in
which
in
spite
of
this
fine
example
of
it
she
hesitated
â€œthereâ€™s
one
thing
of
courseâ€
i
went
on
â€œthey
mustnâ€™t
before
she
goes
see
each
other
for
three
secondsâ€
then
it
came
over
me
that
in
spite
of
floraâ€™s
presumable
sequestration
from
the
instant
of
her
return
from
the
pool
it
might
already
be
too
late
â€œdo
you
meanâ€
i
anxiously
asked
â€œthat
they
have
metâ€
at
this
she
quite
flushed
â€œah
miss
iâ€™m
not
such
a
fool
as
that
if
iâ€™ve
been
obliged
to
leave
her
three
or
four
times
it
has
been
each
time
with
one
of
the
maids
and
at
present
though
sheâ€™s
alone
sheâ€™s
locked
in
safe
and
yetâ€”and
yetâ€
there
were
too
many
things
â€œand
yet
whatâ€
â€œwell
are
you
so
sure
of
the
little
gentlemanâ€
â€œiâ€™m
not
sure
of
anything
but
you
but
i
have
since
last
evening
a
new
hope
i
think
he
wants
to
give
me
an
opening
i
do
believe
thatâ€”poor
little
exquisite
wretchâ€”he
wants
to
speak
last
evening
in
the
firelight
and
the
silence
he
sat
with
me
for
two
hours
as
if
it
were
just
comingâ€
mrs
grose
looked
hard
through
the
window
at
the
gray
gathering
day
â€œand
did
it
comeâ€
â€œno
though
i
waited
and
waited
i
confess
it
didnâ€™t
and
it
was
without
a
breach
of
the
silence
or
so
much
as
a
faint
allusion
to
his
sisterâ€™s
condition
and
absence
that
we
at
last
kissed
for
good
night
all
the
sameâ€
i
continued
â€œi
canâ€™t
if
her
uncle
sees
her
consent
to
his
seeing
her
brother
without
my
having
given
the
boyâ€”and
most
of
all
because
things
have
got
so
badâ€”a
little
more
timeâ€
my
friend
appeared
on
this
ground
more
reluctant
than
i
could
quite
understand
â€œwhat
do
you
mean
by
more
timeâ€
â€œwell
a
day
or
twoâ€”really
to
bring
it
out
heâ€™ll
then
be
on
my
sideâ€”of
which
you
see
the
importance
if
nothing
comes
i
shall
only
fail
and
you
will
at
the
worst
have
helped
me
by
doing
on
your
arrival
in
town
whatever
you
may
have
found
possibleâ€
so
i
put
it
before
her
but
she
continued
for
a
little
so
inscrutably
embarrassed
that
i
came
again
to
her
aid
â€œunless
indeedâ€
i
wound
up
â€œyou
really
want
not
to
goâ€
i
could
see
it
in
her
face
at
last
clear
itself
she
put
out
her
hand
to
me
as
a
pledge
â€œiâ€™ll
goâ€”iâ€™ll
go
iâ€™ll
go
this
morningâ€
i
wanted
to
be
very
just
â€œif
you
should
wish
still
to
wait
i
would
engage
she
shouldnâ€™t
see
meâ€
â€œno
no
itâ€™s
the
place
itself
she
must
leave
itâ€
she
held
me
a
moment
with
heavy
eyes
then
brought
out
the
rest
â€œyour
ideaâ€™s
the
right
one
i
myself
missâ€”â€
â€œwellâ€
â€œi
canâ€™t
stayâ€
the
look
she
gave
me
with
it
made
me
jump
at
possibilities
â€œyou
mean
that
since
yesterday
you
have
seenâ€”â€
she
shook
her
head
with
dignity
â€œiâ€™ve
heardâ€”â€
â€œheardâ€
â€œfrom
that
childâ€”horrors
thereâ€
she
sighed
with
tragic
relief
â€œon
my
honor
miss
she
says
thingsâ€”â€
but
at
this
evocation
she
broke
down
she
dropped
with
a
sudden
sob
upon
my
sofa
and
as
i
had
seen
her
do
before
gave
way
to
all
the
grief
of
it
it
was
quite
in
another
manner
that
i
for
my
part
let
myself
go
â€œoh
thank
godâ€
she
sprang
up
again
at
this
drying
her
eyes
with
a
groan
â€œâ€˜thank
godâ€™â€
â€œit
so
justifies
meâ€
â€œit
does
that
missâ€
i
couldnâ€™t
have
desired
more
emphasis
but
i
just
hesitated
â€œsheâ€™s
so
horribleâ€
i
saw
my
colleague
scarce
knew
how
to
put
it
â€œreally
shockingâ€
â€œand
about
meâ€
â€œabout
you
missâ€”since
you
must
have
it
itâ€™s
beyond
everything
for
a
young
lady
and
i
canâ€™t
think
wherever
she
must
have
picked
upâ€”â€
â€œthe
appalling
language
she
applied
to
me
i
can
thenâ€
i
broke
in
with
a
laugh
that
was
doubtless
significant
enough
it
only
in
truth
left
my
friend
still
more
grave
â€œwell
perhaps
i
ought
to
alsoâ€”since
iâ€™ve
heard
some
of
it
before
yet
i
canâ€™t
bear
itâ€
the
poor
woman
went
on
while
with
the
same
movement
she
glanced
on
my
dressing
table
at
the
face
of
my
watch
â€œbut
i
must
go
backâ€
i
kept
her
however
â€œah
if
you
canâ€™t
bear
itâ€”â€
â€œhow
can
i
stop
with
her
you
mean
why
just
for
that
to
get
her
away
far
from
thisâ€
she
pursued
â€œfar
from
themâ€”â€
â€œshe
may
be
different
she
may
be
freeâ€
i
seized
her
almost
with
joy
â€œthen
in
spite
of
yesterday
you
believeâ€”â€
â€œin
such
doingsâ€
her
simple
description
of
them
required
in
the
light
of
her
expression
to
be
carried
no
further
and
she
gave
me
the
whole
thing
as
she
had
never
done
â€œi
believeâ€
yes
it
was
a
joy
and
we
were
still
shoulder
to
shoulder
if
i
might
continue
sure
of
that
i
should
care
but
little
what
else
happened
my
support
in
the
presence
of
disaster
would
be
the
same
as
it
had
been
in
my
early
need
of
confidence
and
if
my
friend
would
answer
for
my
honesty
i
would
answer
for
all
the
rest
on
the
point
of
taking
leave
of
her
nonetheless
i
was
to
some
extent
embarrassed
â€œthereâ€™s
one
thing
of
courseâ€”it
occurs
to
meâ€”to
remember
my
letter
giving
the
alarm
will
have
reached
town
before
youâ€
i
now
perceived
still
more
how
she
had
been
beating
about
the
bush
and
how
weary
at
last
it
had
made
her
â€œyour
letter
wonâ€™t
have
got
there
your
letter
never
wentâ€
â€œwhat
then
became
of
itâ€
â€œgoodness
knows
master
milesâ€”â€
â€œdo
you
mean
he
took
itâ€
i
gasped
she
hung
fire
but
she
overcame
her
reluctance
â€œi
mean
that
i
saw
yesterday
when
i
came
back
with
miss
flora
that
it
wasnâ€™t
where
you
had
put
it
later
in
the
evening
i
had
the
chance
to
question
luke
and
he
declared
that
he
had
neither
noticed
nor
touched
itâ€
we
could
only
exchange
on
this
one
of
our
deeper
mutual
soundings
and
it
was
mrs
grose
who
first
brought
up
the
plumb
with
an
almost
elated
â€œyou
seeâ€
â€œyes
i
see
that
if
miles
took
it
instead
he
probably
will
have
read
it
and
destroyed
itâ€
â€œand
donâ€™t
you
see
anything
elseâ€
i
faced
her
a
moment
with
a
sad
smile
â€œit
strikes
me
that
by
this
time
your
eyes
are
open
even
wider
than
mineâ€
they
proved
to
be
so
indeed
but
she
could
still
blush
almost
to
show
it
â€œi
make
out
now
what
he
must
have
done
at
schoolâ€
and
she
gave
in
her
simple
sharpness
an
almost
droll
disillusioned
nod
â€œhe
stoleâ€
i
turned
it
overâ€”i
tried
to
be
more
judicial
â€œwellâ€”perhapsâ€
she
looked
as
if
she
found
me
unexpectedly
calm
â€œhe
stole
lettersâ€
she
couldnâ€™t
know
my
reasons
for
a
calmness
after
all
pretty
shallow
so
i
showed
them
off
as
i
might
â€œi
hope
then
it
was
to
more
purpose
than
in
this
case
the
note
at
any
rate
that
i
put
on
the
table
yesterdayâ€
i
pursued
â€œwill
have
given
him
so
scant
an
advantageâ€”for
it
contained
only
the
bare
demand
for
an
interviewâ€”that
he
is
already
much
ashamed
of
having
gone
so
far
for
so
little
and
that
what
he
had
on
his
mind
last
evening
was
precisely
the
need
of
confessionâ€
i
seemed
to
myself
for
the
instant
to
have
mastered
it
to
see
it
all
â€œleave
us
leave
usâ€â€”i
was
already
at
the
door
hurrying
her
off
â€œiâ€™ll
get
it
out
of
him
heâ€™ll
meet
meâ€”heâ€™ll
confess
if
he
confesses
heâ€™s
saved
and
if
heâ€™s
savedâ€”â€
â€œthen
you
areâ€
the
dear
woman
kissed
me
on
this
and
i
took
her
farewell
â€œiâ€™ll
save
you
without
himâ€
she
cried
as
she
went
xxii
yet
it
was
when
she
had
got
offâ€”and
i
missed
her
on
the
spotâ€”that
the
great
pinch
really
came
if
i
had
counted
on
what
it
would
give
me
to
find
myself
alone
with
miles
i
speedily
perceived
at
least
that
it
would
give
me
a
measure
no
hour
of
my
stay
in
fact
was
so
assailed
with
apprehensions
as
that
of
my
coming
down
to
learn
that
the
carriage
containing
mrs
grose
and
my
younger
pupil
had
already
rolled
out
of
the
gates
now
i
was
i
said
to
myself
face
to
face
with
the
elements
and
for
much
of
the
rest
of
the
day
while
i
fought
my
weakness
i
could
consider
that
i
had
been
supremely
rash
it
was
a
tighter
place
still
than
i
had
yet
turned
round
in
all
the
more
that
for
the
first
time
i
could
see
in
the
aspect
of
others
a
confused
reflection
of
the
crisis
what
had
happened
naturally
caused
them
all
to
stare
there
was
too
little
of
the
explained
throw
out
whatever
we
might
in
the
suddenness
of
my
colleagueâ€™s
act
the
maids
and
the
men
looked
blank
the
effect
of
which
on
my
nerves
was
an
aggravation
until
i
saw
the
necessity
of
making
it
a
positive
aid
it
was
precisely
in
short
by
just
clutching
the
helm
that
i
avoided
total
wreck
and
i
dare
say
that
to
bear
up
at
all
i
became
that
morning
very
grand
and
very
dry
i
welcomed
the
consciousness
that
i
was
charged
with
much
to
do
and
i
caused
it
to
be
known
as
well
that
left
thus
to
myself
i
was
quite
remarkably
firm
i
wandered
with
that
manner
for
the
next
hour
or
two
all
over
the
place
and
looked
i
have
no
doubt
as
if
i
were
ready
for
any
onset
so
for
the
benefit
of
whom
it
might
concern
i
paraded
with
a
sick
heart
the
person
it
appeared
least
to
concern
proved
to
be
till
dinner
little
miles
himself
my
perambulations
had
given
me
meanwhile
no
glimpse
of
him
but
they
had
tended
to
make
more
public
the
change
taking
place
in
our
relation
as
a
consequence
of
his
having
at
the
piano
the
day
before
kept
me
in
floraâ€™s
interest
so
beguiled
and
befooled
the
stamp
of
publicity
had
of
course
been
fully
given
by
her
confinement
and
departure
and
the
change
itself
was
now
ushered
in
by
our
nonobservance
of
the
regular
custom
of
the
schoolroom
he
had
already
disappeared
when
on
my
way
down
i
pushed
open
his
door
and
i
learned
below
that
he
had
breakfastedâ€”in
the
presence
of
a
couple
of
the
maidsâ€”with
mrs
grose
and
his
sister
he
had
then
gone
out
as
he
said
for
a
stroll
than
which
nothing
i
reflected
could
better
have
expressed
his
frank
view
of
the
abrupt
transformation
of
my
office
what
he
would
not
permit
this
office
to
consist
of
was
yet
to
be
settled
there
was
a
queer
relief
at
all
eventsâ€”i
mean
for
myself
in
especialâ€”in
the
renouncement
of
one
pretension
if
so
much
had
sprung
to
the
surface
i
scarce
put
it
too
strongly
in
saying
that
what
had
perhaps
sprung
highest
was
the
absurdity
of
our
prolonging
the
fiction
that
i
had
anything
more
to
teach
him
it
sufficiently
stuck
out
that
by
tacit
little
tricks
in
which
even
more
than
myself
he
carried
out
the
care
for
my
dignity
i
had
had
to
appeal
to
him
to
let
me
off
straining
to
meet
him
on
the
ground
of
his
true
capacity
he
had
at
any
rate
his
freedom
now
i
was
never
to
touch
it
again
as
i
had
amply
shown
moreover
when
on
his
joining
me
in
the
schoolroom
the
previous
night
i
had
uttered
on
the
subject
of
the
interval
just
concluded
neither
challenge
nor
hint
i
had
too
much
from
this
moment
my
other
ideas
yet
when
he
at
last
arrived
the
difficulty
of
applying
them
the
accumulations
of
my
problem
were
brought
straight
home
to
me
by
the
beautiful
little
presence
on
which
what
had
occurred
had
as
yet
for
the
eye
dropped
neither
stain
nor
shadow
to
mark
for
the
house
the
high
state
i
cultivated
i
decreed
that
my
meals
with
the
boy
should
be
served
as
we
called
it
downstairs
so
that
i
had
been
awaiting
him
in
the
ponderous
pomp
of
the
room
outside
of
the
window
of
which
i
had
had
from
mrs
grose
that
first
scared
sunday
my
flash
of
something
it
would
scarce
have
done
to
call
light
here
at
present
i
felt
afreshâ€”for
i
had
felt
it
again
and
againâ€”how
my
equilibrium
depended
on
the
success
of
my
rigid
will
the
will
to
shut
my
eyes
as
tight
as
possible
to
the
truth
that
what
i
had
to
deal
with
was
revoltingly
against
nature
i
could
only
get
on
at
all
by
taking
â€œnatureâ€
into
my
confidence
and
my
account
by
treating
my
monstrous
ordeal
as
a
push
in
a
direction
unusual
of
course
and
unpleasant
but
demanding
after
all
for
a
fair
front
only
another
turn
of
the
screw
of
ordinary
human
virtue
no
attempt
nonetheless
could
well
require
more
tact
than
just
this
attempt
to
supply
oneâ€™s
self
all
the
nature
how
could
i
put
even
a
little
of
that
article
into
a
suppression
of
reference
to
what
had
occurred
how
on
the
other
hand
could
i
make
reference
without
a
new
plunge
into
the
hideous
obscure
well
a
sort
of
answer
after
a
time
had
come
to
me
and
it
was
so
far
confirmed
as
that
i
was
met
incontestably
by
the
quickened
vision
of
what
was
rare
in
my
little
companion
it
was
indeed
as
if
he
had
found
even
nowâ€”as
he
had
so
often
found
at
lessonsâ€”still
some
other
delicate
way
to
ease
me
off
wasnâ€™t
there
light
in
the
fact
which
as
we
shared
our
solitude
broke
out
with
a
specious
glitter
it
had
never
yet
quite
wornâ€”the
fact
that
opportunity
aiding
precious
opportunity
which
had
now
come
it
would
be
preposterous
with
a
child
so
endowed
to
forego
the
help
one
might
wrest
from
absolute
intelligence
what
had
his
intelligence
been
given
him
for
but
to
save
him
mightnâ€™t
one
to
reach
his
mind
risk
the
stretch
of
an
angular
arm
over
his
character
it
was
as
if
when
we
were
face
to
face
in
the
dining
room
he
had
literally
shown
me
the
way
the
roast
mutton
was
on
the
table
and
i
had
dispensed
with
attendance
miles
before
he
sat
down
stood
a
moment
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
looked
at
the
joint
on
which
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
passing
some
humorous
judgment
but
what
he
presently
produced
was
â€œi
say
my
dear
is
she
really
very
awfully
illâ€
â€œlittle
flora
not
so
bad
but
that
sheâ€™ll
presently
be
better
london
will
set
her
up
bly
had
ceased
to
agree
with
her
come
here
and
take
your
muttonâ€
he
alertly
obeyed
me
carried
the
plate
carefully
to
his
seat
and
when
he
was
established
went
on
â€œdid
bly
disagree
with
her
so
terribly
suddenlyâ€
â€œnot
so
suddenly
as
you
might
think
one
had
seen
it
coming
onâ€
â€œthen
why
didnâ€™t
you
get
her
off
beforeâ€
â€œbefore
whatâ€
â€œbefore
she
became
too
ill
to
travelâ€
i
found
myself
prompt
â€œsheâ€™s
not
too
ill
to
travel
she
only
might
have
become
so
if
she
had
stayed
this
was
just
the
moment
to
seize
the
journey
will
dissipate
the
influenceâ€â€”oh
i
was
grandâ€”â€œand
carry
it
offâ€
â€œi
see
i
seeâ€â€”miles
for
that
matter
was
grand
too
he
settled
to
his
repast
with
the
charming
little
â€œtable
mannerâ€
that
from
the
day
of
his
arrival
had
relieved
me
of
all
grossness
of
admonition
whatever
he
had
been
driven
from
school
for
it
was
not
for
ugly
feeding
he
was
irreproachable
as
always
today
but
he
was
unmistakably
more
conscious
he
was
discernibly
trying
to
take
for
granted
more
things
than
he
found
without
assistance
quite
easy
and
he
dropped
into
peaceful
silence
while
he
felt
his
situation
our
meal
was
of
the
briefestâ€”mine
a
vain
pretense
and
i
had
the
things
immediately
removed
while
this
was
done
miles
stood
again
with
his
hands
in
his
little
pockets
and
his
back
to
meâ€”stood
and
looked
out
of
the
wide
window
through
which
that
other
day
i
had
seen
what
pulled
me
up
we
continued
silent
while
the
maid
was
with
usâ€”as
silent
it
whimsically
occurred
to
me
as
some
young
couple
who
on
their
wedding
journey
at
the
inn
feel
shy
in
the
presence
of
the
waiter
he
turned
round
only
when
the
waiter
had
left
us
â€œwellâ€”so
weâ€™re
aloneâ€
xxiii
â€œoh
more
or
lessâ€
i
fancy
my
smile
was
pale
â€œnot
absolutely
we
shouldnâ€™t
like
thatâ€
i
went
on
â€œnoâ€”i
suppose
we
shouldnâ€™t
of
course
we
have
the
othersâ€
â€œwe
have
the
othersâ€”we
have
indeed
the
othersâ€
i
concurred
â€œyet
even
though
we
have
themâ€
he
returned
still
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
planted
there
in
front
of
me
â€œthey
donâ€™t
much
count
do
theyâ€
i
made
the
best
of
it
but
i
felt
wan
â€œit
depends
on
what
you
call
â€˜muchâ€™â€
â€œyesâ€â€”with
all
accommodationâ€”â€œeverything
dependsâ€
on
this
however
he
faced
to
the
window
again
and
presently
reached
it
with
his
vague
restless
cogitating
step
he
remained
there
awhile
with
his
forehead
against
the
glass
in
contemplation
of
the
stupid
shrubs
i
knew
and
the
dull
things
of
november
i
had
always
my
hypocrisy
of
â€œworkâ€
behind
which
now
i
gained
the
sofa
steadying
myself
with
it
there
as
i
had
repeatedly
done
at
those
moments
of
torment
that
i
have
described
as
the
moments
of
my
knowing
the
children
to
be
given
to
something
from
which
i
was
barred
i
sufficiently
obeyed
my
habit
of
being
prepared
for
the
worst
but
an
extraordinary
impression
dropped
on
me
as
i
extracted
a
meaning
from
the
boyâ€™s
embarrassed
backâ€”none
other
than
the
impression
that
i
was
not
barred
now
this
inference
grew
in
a
few
minutes
to
sharp
intensity
and
seemed
bound
up
with
the
direct
perception
that
it
was
positively
he
who
was
the
frames
and
squares
of
the
great
window
were
a
kind
of
image
for
him
of
a
kind
of
failure
i
felt
that
i
saw
him
at
any
rate
shut
in
or
shut
out
he
was
admirable
but
not
comfortable
i
took
it
in
with
a
throb
of
hope
wasnâ€™t
he
looking
through
the
haunted
pane
for
something
he
couldnâ€™t
seeâ€”and
wasnâ€™t
it
the
first
time
in
the
whole
business
that
he
had
known
such
a
lapse
the
first
the
very
first
i
found
it
a
splendid
portent
it
made
him
anxious
though
he
watched
himself
he
had
been
anxious
all
day
and
even
while
in
his
usual
sweet
little
manner
he
sat
at
table
had
needed
all
his
small
strange
genius
to
give
it
a
gloss
when
he
at
last
turned
round
to
meet
me
it
was
almost
as
if
this
genius
had
succumbed
â€œwell
i
think
iâ€™m
glad
bly
agrees
with
meâ€
â€œyou
would
certainly
seem
to
have
seen
these
twenty-four
hours
a
good
deal
more
of
it
than
for
some
time
before
i
hopeâ€
i
went
on
bravely
â€œthat
youâ€™ve
been
enjoying
yourselfâ€
â€œoh
yes
iâ€™ve
been
ever
so
far
all
round
aboutâ€”miles
and
miles
away
iâ€™ve
never
been
so
freeâ€
he
had
really
a
manner
of
his
own
and
i
could
only
try
to
keep
up
with
him
â€œwell
do
you
like
itâ€
he
stood
there
smiling
then
at
last
he
put
into
two
wordsâ€”â€œdo
youâ€â€”more
discrimination
than
i
had
ever
heard
two
words
contain
before
i
had
time
to
deal
with
that
however
he
continued
as
if
with
the
sense
that
this
was
an
impertinence
to
be
softened
â€œnothing
could
be
more
charming
than
the
way
you
take
it
for
of
course
if
weâ€™re
alone
together
now
itâ€™s
you
that
are
alone
most
but
i
hopeâ€
he
threw
in
â€œyou
donâ€™t
particularly
mindâ€
â€œhaving
to
do
with
youâ€
i
asked
â€œmy
dear
child
how
can
i
help
minding
though
iâ€™ve
renounced
all
claim
to
your
companyâ€”youâ€™re
so
beyond
meâ€”i
at
least
greatly
enjoy
it
what
else
should
i
stay
on
forâ€
he
looked
at
me
more
directly
and
the
expression
of
his
face
graver
now
struck
me
as
the
most
beautiful
i
had
ever
found
in
it
â€œyou
stay
on
just
for
thatâ€
â€œcertainly
i
stay
on
as
your
friend
and
from
the
tremendous
interest
i
take
in
you
till
something
can
be
done
for
you
that
may
be
more
worth
your
while
that
neednâ€™t
surprise
youâ€
my
voice
trembled
so
that
i
felt
it
impossible
to
suppress
the
shake
â€œdonâ€™t
you
remember
how
i
told
you
when
i
came
and
sat
on
your
bed
the
night
of
the
storm
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
i
wouldnâ€™t
do
for
youâ€
â€œyes
yesâ€
he
on
his
side
more
and
more
visibly
nervous
had
a
tone
to
master
but
he
was
so
much
more
successful
than
i
that
laughing
out
through
his
gravity
he
could
pretend
we
were
pleasantly
jesting
â€œonly
that
i
think
was
to
get
me
to
do
something
for
youâ€
â€œit
was
partly
to
get
you
to
do
somethingâ€
i
conceded
â€œbut
you
know
you
didnâ€™t
do
itâ€
â€œoh
yesâ€
he
said
with
the
brightest
superficial
eagerness
â€œyou
wanted
me
to
tell
you
somethingâ€
â€œthatâ€™s
it
out
straight
out
what
you
have
on
your
mind
you
knowâ€
â€œah
then
is
that
what
youâ€™ve
stayed
over
forâ€
he
spoke
with
a
gaiety
through
which
i
could
still
catch
the
finest
little
quiver
of
resentful
passion
but
i
canâ€™t
begin
to
express
the
effect
upon
me
of
an
implication
of
surrender
even
so
faint
it
was
as
if
what
i
had
yearned
for
had
come
at
last
only
to
astonish
me
â€œwell
yesâ€”i
may
as
well
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
it
was
precisely
for
thatâ€
he
waited
so
long
that
i
supposed
it
for
the
purpose
of
repudiating
the
assumption
on
which
my
action
had
been
founded
but
what
he
finally
said
was
â€œdo
you
mean
nowâ€”hereâ€
â€œthere
couldnâ€™t
be
a
better
place
or
timeâ€
he
looked
round
him
uneasily
and
i
had
the
rareâ€”oh
the
queerâ€”impression
of
the
very
first
symptom
i
had
seen
in
him
of
the
approach
of
immediate
fear
it
was
as
if
he
were
suddenly
afraid
of
meâ€”which
struck
me
indeed
as
perhaps
the
best
thing
to
make
him
yet
in
the
very
pang
of
the
effort
i
felt
it
vain
to
try
sternness
and
i
heard
myself
the
next
instant
so
gentle
as
to
be
almost
grotesque
â€œyou
want
so
to
go
out
againâ€
â€œawfullyâ€
he
smiled
at
me
heroically
and
the
touching
little
bravery
of
it
was
enhanced
by
his
actually
flushing
with
pain
he
had
picked
up
his
hat
which
he
had
brought
in
and
stood
twirling
it
in
a
way
that
gave
me
even
as
i
was
just
nearly
reaching
port
a
perverse
horror
of
what
i
was
doing
to
do
it
in
any
way
was
an
act
of
violence
for
what
did
it
consist
of
but
the
obtrusion
of
the
idea
of
grossness
and
guilt
on
a
small
helpless
creature
who
had
been
for
me
a
revelation
of
the
possibilities
of
beautiful
intercourse
wasnâ€™t
it
base
to
create
for
a
being
so
exquisite
a
mere
alien
awkwardness
i
suppose
i
now
read
into
our
situation
a
clearness
it
couldnâ€™t
have
had
at
the
time
for
i
seem
to
see
our
poor
eyes
already
lighted
with
some
spark
of
a
prevision
of
the
anguish
that
was
to
come
so
we
circled
about
with
terrors
and
scruples
like
fighters
not
daring
to
close
but
it
was
for
each
other
we
feared
that
kept
us
a
little
longer
suspended
and
unbruised
â€œiâ€™ll
tell
you
everythingâ€
miles
saidâ€”â€œi
mean
iâ€™ll
tell
you
anything
you
like
youâ€™ll
stay
on
with
me
and
we
shall
both
be
all
right
and
i
will
tell
youâ€”i
will
but
not
nowâ€
â€œwhy
not
nowâ€
my
insistence
turned
him
from
me
and
kept
him
once
more
at
his
window
in
a
silence
during
which
between
us
you
might
have
heard
a
pin
drop
then
he
was
before
me
again
with
the
air
of
a
person
for
whom
outside
someone
who
had
frankly
to
be
reckoned
with
was
waiting
â€œi
have
to
see
lukeâ€
i
had
not
yet
reduced
him
to
quite
so
vulgar
a
lie
and
i
felt
proportionately
ashamed
but
horrible
as
it
was
his
lies
made
up
my
truth
i
achieved
thoughtfully
a
few
loops
of
my
knitting
â€œwell
then
go
to
luke
and
iâ€™ll
wait
for
what
you
promise
only
in
return
for
that
satisfy
before
you
leave
me
one
very
much
smaller
requestâ€
he
looked
as
if
he
felt
he
had
succeeded
enough
to
be
able
still
a
little
to
bargain
â€œvery
much
smallerâ€”â€
â€œyes
a
mere
fraction
of
the
whole
tell
meâ€â€”oh
my
work
preoccupied
me
and
i
was
offhandâ€”â€œif
yesterday
afternoon
from
the
table
in
the
hall
you
took
you
know
my
letterâ€
xxiv
my
sense
of
how
he
received
this
suffered
for
a
minute
from
something
that
i
can
describe
only
as
a
fierce
split
of
my
attentionâ€”a
stroke
that
at
first
as
i
sprang
straight
up
reduced
me
to
the
mere
blind
movement
of
getting
hold
of
him
drawing
him
close
and
while
i
just
fell
for
support
against
the
nearest
piece
of
furniture
instinctively
keeping
him
with
his
back
to
the
window
the
appearance
was
full
upon
us
that
i
had
already
had
to
deal
with
here
peter
quint
had
come
into
view
like
a
sentinel
before
a
prison
the
next
thing
i
saw
was
that
from
outside
he
had
reached
the
window
and
then
i
knew
that
close
to
the
glass
and
glaring
in
through
it
he
offered
once
more
to
the
room
his
white
face
of
damnation
it
represents
but
grossly
what
took
place
within
me
at
the
sight
to
say
that
on
the
second
my
decision
was
made
yet
i
believe
that
no
woman
so
overwhelmed
ever
in
so
short
a
time
recovered
her
grasp
of
the
act
it
came
to
me
in
the
very
horror
of
the
immediate
presence
that
the
act
would
be
seeing
and
facing
what
i
saw
and
faced
to
keep
the
boy
himself
unaware
the
inspirationâ€”i
can
call
it
by
no
other
nameâ€”was
that
i
felt
how
voluntarily
how
transcendently
i
might
it
was
like
fighting
with
a
demon
for
a
human
soul
and
when
i
had
fairly
so
appraised
it
i
saw
how
the
human
soulâ€”held
out
in
the
tremor
of
my
hands
at
armâ€™s
lengthâ€”had
a
perfect
dew
of
sweat
on
a
lovely
childish
forehead
the
face
that
was
close
to
mine
was
as
white
as
the
face
against
the
glass
and
out
of
it
presently
came
a
sound
not
low
nor
weak
but
as
if
from
much
further
away
that
i
drank
like
a
waft
of
fragrance
â€œyesâ€”i
took
itâ€
at
this
with
a
moan
of
joy
i
enfolded
i
drew
him
close
and
while
i
held
him
to
my
breast
where
i
could
feel
in
the
sudden
fever
of
his
little
body
the
tremendous
pulse
of
his
little
heart
i
kept
my
eyes
on
the
thing
at
the
window
and
saw
it
move
and
shift
its
posture
i
have
likened
it
to
a
sentinel
but
its
slow
wheel
for
a
moment
was
rather
the
prowl
of
a
baffled
beast
my
present
quickened
courage
however
was
such
that
not
too
much
to
let
it
through
i
had
to
shade
as
it
were
my
flame
meanwhile
the
glare
of
the
face
was
again
at
the
window
the
scoundrel
fixed
as
if
to
watch
and
wait
it
was
the
very
confidence
that
i
might
now
defy
him
as
well
as
the
positive
certitude
by
this
time
of
the
childâ€™s
unconsciousness
that
made
me
go
on
â€œwhat
did
you
take
it
forâ€
â€œto
see
what
you
said
about
meâ€
â€œyou
opened
the
letterâ€
â€œi
opened
itâ€
my
eyes
were
now
as
i
held
him
off
a
little
again
on
milesâ€™s
own
face
in
which
the
collapse
of
mockery
showed
me
how
complete
was
the
ravage
of
uneasiness
what
was
prodigious
was
that
at
last
by
my
success
his
sense
was
sealed
and
his
communication
stopped
he
knew
that
he
was
in
presence
but
knew
not
of
what
and
knew
still
less
that
i
also
was
and
that
i
did
know
and
what
did
this
strain
of
trouble
matter
when
my
eyes
went
back
to
the
window
only
to
see
that
the
air
was
clear
again
andâ€”by
my
personal
triumphâ€”the
influence
quenched
there
was
nothing
there
i
felt
that
the
cause
was
mine
and
that
i
should
surely
get
all
â€œand
you
found
nothingâ€â€”i
let
my
elation
out
he
gave
the
most
mournful
thoughtful
little
headshake
â€œnothingâ€
â€œnothing
nothingâ€
i
almost
shouted
in
my
joy
â€œnothing
nothingâ€
he
sadly
repeated
i
kissed
his
forehead
it
was
drenched
â€œso
what
have
you
done
with
itâ€
â€œiâ€™ve
burned
itâ€
â€œburned
itâ€
it
was
now
or
never
â€œis
that
what
you
did
at
schoolâ€
oh
what
this
brought
up
â€œat
schoolâ€
â€œdid
you
take
lettersâ€”or
other
thingsâ€
â€œother
thingsâ€
he
appeared
now
to
be
thinking
of
something
far
off
and
that
reached
him
only
through
the
pressure
of
his
anxiety
yet
it
did
reach
him
â€œdid
i
stealâ€
i
felt
myself
redden
to
the
roots
of
my
hair
as
well
as
wonder
if
it
were
more
strange
to
put
to
a
gentleman
such
a
question
or
to
see
him
take
it
with
allowances
that
gave
the
very
distance
of
his
fall
in
the
world
â€œwas
it
for
that
you
mightnâ€™t
go
backâ€
the
only
thing
he
felt
was
rather
a
dreary
little
surprise
â€œdid
you
know
i
mightnâ€™t
go
backâ€
â€œi
know
everythingâ€
he
gave
me
at
this
the
longest
and
strangest
look
â€œeverythingâ€
â€œeverything
therefore
did
youâ€”â€
but
i
couldnâ€™t
say
it
again
miles
could
very
simply
â€œno
i
didnâ€™t
stealâ€
my
face
must
have
shown
him
i
believed
him
utterly
yet
my
handsâ€”but
it
was
for
pure
tendernessâ€”shook
him
as
if
to
ask
him
why
if
it
was
all
for
nothing
he
had
condemned
me
to
months
of
torment
â€œwhat
then
did
you
doâ€
he
looked
in
vague
pain
all
round
the
top
of
the
room
and
drew
his
breath
two
or
three
times
over
as
if
with
difficulty
he
might
have
been
standing
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
raising
his
eyes
to
some
faint
green
twilight
â€œwellâ€”i
said
thingsâ€
â€œonly
thatâ€
â€œthey
thought
it
was
enoughâ€
â€œto
turn
you
out
forâ€
never
truly
had
a
person
â€œturned
outâ€
shown
so
little
to
explain
it
as
this
little
person
he
appeared
to
weigh
my
question
but
in
a
manner
quite
detached
and
almost
helpless
â€œwell
i
suppose
i
oughtnâ€™tâ€
â€œbut
to
whom
did
you
say
themâ€
he
evidently
tried
to
remember
but
it
droppedâ€”he
had
lost
it
â€œi
donâ€™t
knowâ€
he
almost
smiled
at
me
in
the
desolation
of
his
surrender
which
was
indeed
practically
by
this
time
so
complete
that
i
ought
to
have
left
it
there
but
i
was
infatuatedâ€”i
was
blind
with
victory
though
even
then
the
very
effect
that
was
to
have
brought
him
so
much
nearer
was
already
that
of
added
separation
â€œwas
it
to
everyoneâ€
i
asked
â€œno
it
was
only
toâ€”â€
but
he
gave
a
sick
little
headshake
â€œi
donâ€™t
remember
their
namesâ€
â€œwere
they
then
so
manyâ€
â€œnoâ€”only
a
few
those
i
likedâ€
those
he
liked
i
seemed
to
float
not
into
clearness
but
into
a
darker
obscure
and
within
a
minute
there
had
come
to
me
out
of
my
very
pity
the
appalling
alarm
of
his
being
perhaps
innocent
it
was
for
the
instant
confounding
and
bottomless
for
if
he
were
innocent
what
then
on
earth
was
i
paralyzed
while
it
lasted
by
the
mere
brush
of
the
question
i
let
him
go
a
little
so
that
with
a
deep-drawn
sigh
he
turned
away
from
me
again
which
as
he
faced
toward
the
clear
window
i
suffered
feeling
that
i
had
nothing
now
there
to
keep
him
from
â€œand
did
they
repeat
what
you
saidâ€
i
went
on
after
a
moment
he
was
soon
at
some
distance
from
me
still
breathing
hard
and
again
with
the
air
though
now
without
anger
for
it
of
being
confined
against
his
will
once
more
as
he
had
done
before
he
looked
up
at
the
dim
day
as
if
of
what
had
hitherto
sustained
him
nothing
was
left
but
an
unspeakable
anxiety
â€œoh
yesâ€
he
nevertheless
repliedâ€”â€œthey
must
have
repeated
them
to
those
they
likedâ€
he
added
there
was
somehow
less
of
it
than
i
had
expected
but
i
turned
it
over
â€œand
these
things
came
roundâ€”â€
â€œto
the
masters
oh
yesâ€
he
answered
very
simply
â€œbut
i
didnâ€™t
know
theyâ€™d
tellâ€
â€œthe
masters
they
didnâ€™tâ€”theyâ€™ve
never
told
thatâ€™s
why
i
ask
youâ€
he
turned
to
me
again
his
little
beautiful
fevered
face
â€œyes
it
was
too
badâ€
â€œtoo
badâ€
â€œwhat
i
suppose
i
sometimes
said
to
write
homeâ€
i
canâ€™t
name
the
exquisite
pathos
of
the
contradiction
given
to
such
a
speech
by
such
a
speaker
i
only
know
that
the
next
instant
i
heard
myself
throw
off
with
homely
force
â€œstuff
and
nonsenseâ€
but
the
next
after
that
i
must
have
sounded
stern
enough
â€œwhat
were
these
thingsâ€
my
sternness
was
all
for
his
judge
his
executioner
yet
it
made
him
avert
himself
again
and
that
movement
made
me
with
a
single
bound
and
an
irrepressible
cry
spring
straight
upon
him
for
there
again
against
the
glass
as
if
to
blight
his
confession
and
stay
his
answer
was
the
hideous
author
of
our
woeâ€”the
white
face
of
damnation
i
felt
a
sick
swim
at
the
drop
of
my
victory
and
all
the
return
of
my
battle
so
that
the
wildness
of
my
veritable
leap
only
served
as
a
great
betrayal
i
saw
him
from
the
midst
of
my
act
meet
it
with
a
divination
and
on
the
perception
that
even
now
he
only
guessed
and
that
the
window
was
still
to
his
own
eyes
free
i
let
the
impulse
flame
up
to
convert
the
climax
of
his
dismay
into
the
very
proof
of
his
liberation
â€œno
more
no
more
no
moreâ€
i
shrieked
as
i
tried
to
press
him
against
me
to
my
visitant
â€œis
she
hereâ€
miles
panted
as
he
caught
with
his
sealed
eyes
the
direction
of
my
words
then
as
his
strange
â€œsheâ€
staggered
me
and
with
a
gasp
i
echoed
it
â€œmiss
jessel
miss
jesselâ€
he
with
a
sudden
fury
gave
me
back
i
seized
stupefied
his
suppositionâ€”some
sequel
to
what
we
had
done
to
flora
but
this
made
me
only
want
to
show
him
that
it
was
better
still
than
that
â€œitâ€™s
not
miss
jessel
but
itâ€™s
at
the
windowâ€”straight
before
us
itâ€™s
thereâ€”the
coward
horror
there
for
the
last
timeâ€
at
this
after
a
second
in
which
his
head
made
the
movement
of
a
baffled
dogâ€™s
on
a
scent
and
then
gave
a
frantic
little
shake
for
air
and
light
he
was
at
me
in
a
white
rage
bewildered
glaring
vainly
over
the
place
and
missing
wholly
though
it
now
to
my
sense
filled
the
room
like
the
taste
of
poison
the
wide
overwhelming
presence
â€œitâ€™s
heâ€
i
was
so
determined
to
have
all
my
proof
that
i
flashed
into
ice
to
challenge
him
â€œwhom
do
you
mean
by
â€˜heâ€™â€
â€œpeter
quintâ€”you
devilâ€
his
face
gave
again
round
the
room
its
convulsed
supplication
â€œwhereâ€
they
are
in
my
ears
still
his
supreme
surrender
of
the
name
and
his
tribute
to
my
devotion
â€œwhat
does
he
matter
now
my
ownâ€”what
will
he
ever
matter
i
have
youâ€
i
launched
at
the
beast
â€œbut
he
has
lost
you
foreverâ€
then
for
the
demonstration
of
my
work
â€œthere
thereâ€
i
said
to
miles
but
he
had
already
jerked
straight
round
stared
glared
again
and
seen
but
the
quiet
day
with
the
stroke
of
the
loss
i
was
so
proud
of
he
uttered
the
cry
of
a
creature
hurled
over
an
abyss
and
the
grasp
with
which
i
recovered
him
might
have
been
that
of
catching
him
in
his
fall
i
caught
him
yes
i
held
himâ€”it
may
be
imagined
with
what
a
passion
but
at
the
end
of
a
minute
i
began
to
feel
what
it
truly
was
that
i
held
we
were
alone
with
the
quiet
day
and
his
little
heart
dispossessed
had
stopped
