two
men
stood
in
the
billiard-room
of
an
old
country
house
talking
play
which
had
been
of
a
half-hearted
nature
was
over
and
they
sat
at
the
open
window
looking
out
over
the
park
stretching
away
beneath
them
conversing
idly
your
time's
nearly
up
jem
said
one
at
length
this
time
six
weeks
you'll
be
yawning
out
the
honeymoon
and
cursing
the
man--woman
i
mean--
who
invented
them
jem
benson
stretched
his
long
limbs
in
the
chair
and
grunted
in
dissent
i've
never
understood
it
continued
wilfred
carr
yawning
it's
not
in
my
line
at
all
i
never
had
enough
money
for
my
own
wants
let
alone
for
two
perhaps
if
i
were
as
rich
as
you
or
croesus
i
might
regard
it
differently
there
was
just
sufficient
meaning
in
the
latter
part
of
the
remark
for
his
cousin
to
forbear
to
reply
to
it
he
continued
to
gaze
out
of
the
window
and
to
smoke
slowly
not
being
as
rich
as
croesus--or
you
resumed
carr
regarding
him
from
beneath
lowered
lids
i
paddle
my
own
canoe
down
the
stream
of
time
and
tying
it
to
my
friends'
door-posts
go
in
to
eat
their
dinners
quite
venetian
said
jem
benson
still
looking
out
of
the
window
it's
not
a
bad
thing
for
you
wilfred
that
you
have
the
doorposts
and
dinners--and
friends
carr
grunted
in
his
turn
seriously
though
jem
he
said
slowly
you're
a
lucky
fellow
a
very
lucky
fellow
if
there
is
a
better
girl
above
ground
than
olive
i
should
like
to
see
her
yes
said
the
other
quietly
she's
such
an
exceptional
girl
continued
carr
staring
out
of
the
window
she's
so
good
and
gentle
she
thinks
you
are
a
bundle
of
all
the
virtues
he
laughed
frankly
and
joyously
but
the
other
man
did
not
join
him
strong
sense--of
right
and
wrong
though
continued
carr
musingly
do
you
know
i
believe
that
if
she
found
out
that
you
were
not----
not
what
demanded
benson
turning
upon
him
fiercely
not
what
everything
that
you
are
returned
his
cousin
with
a
grin
that
belied
his
words
i
believe
she'd
drop
you
talk
about
something
else
said
benson
slowly
your
pleasantries
are
not
always
in
the
best
taste
wilfred
carr
rose
and
taking
a
cue
from
the
rack
bent
over
the
board
and
practiced
one
or
two
favourite
shots
the
only
other
subject
i
can
talk
about
just
at
present
is
my
own
financial
affairs
he
said
slowly
as
he
walked
round
the
table
talk
about
something
else
said
benson
again
bluntly
and
the
two
things
are
connected
said
carr
and
dropping
his
cue
he
half
sat
on
the
table
and
eyed
his
cousin
there
was
a
long
silence
benson
pitched
the
end
of
his
cigar
out
of
the
window
and
leaning
back
closed
his
eyes
do
you
follow
me
inquired
carr
at
length
benson
opened
his
eyes
and
nodded
at
the
window
do
you
want
to
follow
my
cigar
he
demanded
i
should
prefer
to
depart
by
the
usual
way
for
your
sake
returned
the
other
unabashed
if
i
left
by
the
window
all
sorts
of
questions
would
be
asked
and
you
know
what
a
talkative
chap
i
am
so
long
as
you
don't
talk
about
my
affairs
returned
the
other
restraining
himself
by
an
obvious
effort
you
can
talk
yourself
hoarse
i'm
in
a
mess
said
carr
slowly
a
devil
of
a
mess
if
i
don't
raise
fifteen
hundred
by
this
day
fortnight
i
may
be
getting
my
board
and
lodging
free
would
that
be
any
change
questioned
benson
the
quality
would
retorted
the
other
the
address
also
would
not
be
good
seriously
jem
will
you
let
me
have
the
fifteen
hundred
no
said
the
other
simply
carr
went
white
it's
to
save
me
from
ruin
he
said
thickly
i've
helped
you
till
i'm
tired
said
benson
turning
and
regarding
him
and
it
is
all
to
no
good
if
you've
got
into
a
mess
get
out
of
it
you
should
not
be
so
fond
of
giving
autographs
away
it's
foolish
i
admit
said
carr
deliberately
i
won't
do
so
any
more
by
the
way
i've
got
some
to
sell
you
needn't
sneer
they're
not
my
own
whose
are
they
inquired
the
other
yours
benson
got
up
from
his
chair
and
crossed
over
to
him
what
is
this
he
asked
quietly
blackmail
call
it
what
you
like
said
carr
i've
got
some
letters
for
sale
price
fifteen
hundred
and
i
know
a
man
who
would
buy
them
at
that
price
for
the
mere
chance
of
getting
olive
from
you
i'll
give
you
first
offer
if
you
have
got
any
letters
bearing
my
signature
you
will
be
good
enough
to
give
them
to
me
said
benson
very
slowly
they're
mine
said
carr
lightly
given
to
me
by
the
lady
you
wrote
them
to
i
must
say
that
they
are
not
all
in
the
best
possible
taste
his
cousin
reached
forward
suddenly
and
catching
him
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
pinned
him
down
on
the
table
give
me
those
letters
he
breathed
sticking
his
face
close
to
carr's
they're
not
here
said
carr
struggling
i'm
not
a
fool
let
me
go
or
i'll
raise
the
price
the
other
man
raised
him
from
the
table
in
his
powerful
hands
apparently
with
the
intention
of
dashing
his
head
against
it
then
suddenly
his
hold
relaxed
as
an
astonished-looking
maid-servant
entered
the
room
with
letters
carr
sat
up
hastily
that's
how
it
was
done
said
benson
for
the
girl's
benefit
as
he
took
the
letters
i
don't
wonder
at
the
other
man
making
him
pay
for
it
then
said
carr
blandly
you
will
give
me
those
letters
said
benson
suggestively
as
the
girl
left
the
room
at
the
price
i
mentioned
yes
said
carr
but
so
sure
as
i
am
a
living
man
if
you
lay
your
clumsy
hands
on
me
again
i'll
double
it
now
i'll
leave
you
for
a
time
while
you
think
it
over
he
took
a
cigar
from
the
box
and
lighting
it
carefully
quitted
the
room
his
cousin
waited
until
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
and
then
turning
to
the
window
sat
there
in
a
fit
of
fury
as
silent
as
it
was
terrible
the
air
was
fresh
and
sweet
from
the
park
heavy
with
the
scent
of
new-mown
grass
the
fragrance
of
a
cigar
was
now
added
to
it
and
glancing
out
he
saw
his
cousin
pacing
slowly
by
he
rose
and
went
to
the
door
and
then
apparently
altering
his
mind
he
returned
to
the
window
and
watched
the
figure
of
his
cousin
as
it
moved
slowly
away
into
the
moonlight
then
he
rose
again
and
for
a
long
time
the
room
was
empty





it
was
empty
when
mrs
benson
came
in
some
time
later
to
say
good-night
to
her
son
on
her
way
to
bed
she
walked
slowly
round
the
table
and
pausing
at
the
window
gazed
from
it
in
idle
thought
until
she
saw
the
figure
of
her
son
advancing
with
rapid
strides
toward
the
house
he
looked
up
at
the
window
good-night
said
she
good-night
said
benson
in
a
deep
voice
where
is
wilfred
oh
he
has
gone
said
benson
gone
we
had
a
few
words
he
was
wanting
money
again
and
i
gave
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
i
don't
think
we
shall
see
him
again
poor
wilfred
sighed
mrs
benson
he
is
always
in
trouble
of
some
sort
i
hope
that
you
were
not
too
hard
upon
him
no
more
than
he
deserved
said
her
son
sternly
good
night
ii
the
well
which
had
long
ago
fallen
into
disuse
was
almost
hidden
by
the
thick
tangle
of
undergrowth
which
ran
riot
at
that
corner
of
the
old
park
it
was
partly
covered
by
the
shrunken
half
of
a
lid
above
which
a
rusty
windlass
creaked
in
company
with
the
music
of
the
pines
when
the
wind
blew
strongly
the
full
light
of
the
sun
never
reached
it
and
the
ground
surrounding
it
was
moist
and
green
when
other
parts
of
the
park
were
gaping
with
the
heat
two
people
walking
slowly
round
the
park
in
the
fragrant
stillness
of
a
summer
evening
strayed
in
the
direction
of
the
well
no
use
going
through
this
wilderness
olive
said
benson
pausing
on
the
outskirts
of
the
pines
and
eyeing
with
some
disfavour
the
gloom
beyond
best
part
of
the
park
said
the
girl
briskly
you
know
it's
my
favourite
spot
i
know
you're
very
fond
of
sitting
on
the
coping
said
the
man
slowly
and
i
wish
you
wouldn't
one
day
you
will
lean
back
too
far
and
fall
in
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
truth
said
olive
lightly
come
along
she
ran
from
him
and
was
lost
in
the
shadow
of
the
pines
the
bracken
crackling
beneath
her
feet
as
she
ran
her
companion
followed
slowly
and
emerging
from
the
gloom
saw
her
poised
daintily
on
the
edge
of
the
well
with
her
feet
hidden
in
the
rank
grass
and
nettles
which
surrounded
it
she
motioned
her
companion
to
take
a
seat
by
her
side
and
smiled
softly
as
she
felt
a
strong
arm
passed
about
her
waist
i
like
this
place
said
she
breaking
a
long
silence
it
is
so
dismal
--so
uncanny
do
you
know
i
wouldn't
dare
to
sit
here
alone
jem
i
should
imagine
that
all
sorts
of
dreadful
things
were
hidden
behind
the
bushes
and
trees
waiting
to
spring
out
on
me
ugh
you'd
better
let
me
take
you
in
said
her
companion
tenderly
the
well
isn't
always
wholesome
especially
in
the
hot
weather
let's
make
a
move
the
girl
gave
an
obstinate
little
shake
and
settled
herself
more
securely
on
her
seat
smoke
your
cigar
in
peace
she
said
quietly
i
am
settled
here
for
a
quiet
talk
has
anything
been
heard
of
wilfred
yet
nothing
quite
a
dramatic
disappearance
isn't
it
she
continued
another
scrape
i
suppose
and
another
letter
for
you
in
the
same
old
strain
'dear
jem
help
me
out'
jem
benson
blew
a
cloud
of
fragrant
smoke
into
the
air
and
holding
his
cigar
between
his
teeth
brushed
away
the
ash
from
his
coat
sleeves
i
wonder
what
he
would
have
done
without
you
said
the
girl
pressing
his
arm
affectionately
gone
under
long
ago
i
suppose
when
we
are
married
jem
i
shall
presume
upon
the
relationship
to
lecture
him
he
is
very
wild
but
he
has
his
good
points
poor
fellow
i
never
saw
them
said
benson
with
startling
bitterness
god
knows
i
never
saw
them
he
is
nobody's
enemy
but
his
own
said
the
girl
startled
by
this
outburst
you
don't
know
much
about
him
said
the
other
sharply
he
was
not
above
blackmail
not
above
ruining
the
life
of
a
friend
to
do
himself
a
benefit
a
loafer
a
cur
and
a
liar
the
girl
looked
up
at
him
soberly
but
timidly
and
took
his
arm
without
a
word
and
they
both
sat
silent
while
evening
deepened
into
night
and
the
beams
of
the
moon
filtering
through
the
branches
surrounded
them
with
a
silver
network
her
head
sank
upon
his
shoulder
till
suddenly
with
a
sharp
cry
she
sprang
to
her
feet
what
was
that
she
cried
breathlessly
what
was
what
demanded
benson
springing
up
and
clutching
her
fast
by
the
arm
she
caught
her
breath
and
tried
to
laugh
you're
hurting
me
jem
his
hold
relaxed
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
gently
what
was
it
startled
you
i
was
startled
she
said
slowly
putting
her
hands
on
his
shoulder
i
suppose
the
words
i
used
just
now
are
ringing
in
my
ears
but
i
fancied
that
somebody
behind
us
whispered
'jem
help
me
out'
fancy
repeated
benson
and
his
voice
shook
but
these
fancies
are
not
good
for
you
you--are
frightened--at
the
dark
and
the
gloom
of
these
trees
let
me
take
you
back
to
the
house
no
i'm
not
frightened
said
the
girl
reseating
herself
i
should
never
be
really
frightened
of
anything
when
you
were
with
me
jem
i'm
surprised
at
myself
for
being
so
silly
the
man
made
no
reply
but
stood
a
strong
dark
figure
a
yard
or
two
from
the
well
as
though
waiting
for
her
to
join
him
come
and
sit
down
sir
cried
olive
patting
the
brickwork
with
her
small
white
hand
one
would
think
that
you
did
not
like
your
company
he
obeyed
slowly
and
took
a
seat
by
her
side
drawing
so
hard
at
his
cigar
that
the
light
of
it
shone
upon
his
fare
at
every
breath
he
passed
his
arm
firm
and
rigid
as
steel
behind
her
with
his
hand
resting
on
the
brickwork
beyond
are
you
warm
enough
he
asked
tenderly
as
she
made
a
little
movement
pretty
fair
she
shivered
one
oughtn't
to
be
cold
at
this
time
of
the
year
but
there's
a
cold
damp
air
comes
up
from
the
well
as
she
spoke
a
faint
splash
sounded
from
the
depths
below
and
for
the
second
time
that
evening
she
sprang
from
the
well
with
a
little
cry
of
dismay
what
is
it
now
he
asked
in
a
fearful
voice
he
stood
by
her
side
and
gazed
at
the
well
as
though
half
expecting
to
see
the
cause
of
her
alarm
emerge
from
it
oh
my
bracelet
she
cried
in
distress
my
poor
mother's
bracelet
i've
dropped
it
down
the
well
your
bracelet
repeated
benson
dully
your
bracelet
the
diamond
one
the
one
that
was
my
mother's
said
olive
oh
we
can
get
it
back
surely
we
must
have
the
water
drained
off
your
bracelet
repeated
benson
stupidly
jem
said
the
girl
in
terrified
tones
dear
jem
what
is
the
matter
for
the
man
she
loved
was
standing
regarding
her
with
horror
the
moon
which
touched
it
was
not
responsible
for
all
the
whiteness
of
the
distorted
face
and
she
shrank
back
in
fear
to
the
edge
of
the
well
he
saw
her
fear
and
by
a
mighty
effort
regained
his
composure
and
took
her
hand
poor
little
girl
he
murmured
you
frightened
me
i
was
not
looking
when
you
cried
and
i
thought
that
you
were
slipping
from
my
arms
down--down--
his
voice
broke
and
the
girl
throwing
herself
into
his
arms
clung
to
him
convulsively
there
there
said
benson
fondly
don't
cry
don't
cry
to-morrow
said
olive
half-laughing
half-crying
we
will
all
come
round
the
well
with
hook
and
line
and
fish
for
it
it
will
be
quite
a
new
sport
no
we
must
try
some
other
way
said
benson
you
shall
have
it
back
how
asked
the
girl
you
shall
see
said
benson
to-morrow
morning
at
latest
you
shall
have
it
back
till
then
promise
me
that
you
will
not
mention
your
loss
to
anyone
promise
i
promise
said
olive
wonderingly
but
why
not
it
is
of
great
value
for
one
thing
and--but
there--there
are
many
reasons
for
one
thing
it
is
my
duty
to
get
it
for
you
wouldn't
you
like
to
jump
down
for
it
she
asked
mischievously
listen
she
stooped
for
a
stone
and
dropped
it
down
fancy
being
where
that
is
now
she
said
peering
into
the
blackness
fancy
going
round
and
round
like
a
mouse
in
a
pail
clutching
at
the
slimy
sides
with
the
water
filling
your
mouth
and
looking
up
to
the
little
patch
of
sky
above
you
had
better
come
in
said
benson
very
quietly
you
are
developing
a
taste
for
the
morbid
and
horrible
the
girl
turned
and
taking
his
arm
walked
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
house
mrs
benson
who
was
sitting
in
the
porch
rose
to
receive
them
you
shouldn't
have
kept
her
out
so
long
she
said
chidingly
where
have
you
been
sitting
on
the
well
said
olive
smiling
discussing
our
future
i
don't
believe
that
place
is
healthy
said
mrs
benson
emphatically
i
really
think
it
might
be
filled
in
jem
all
right
said
her
son
slowly
pity
it
wasn't
filled
in
long
ago
he
took
the
chair
vacated
by
his
mother
as
she
entered
the
house
with
olive
and
with
his
hands
hanging
limply
over
the
sides
sat
in
deep
thought
after
a
time
he
rose
and
going
upstairs
to
a
room
which
was
set
apart
for
sporting
requisites
selected
a
sea
fishing
line
and
some
hooks
and
stole
softly
downstairs
again
he
walked
swiftly
across
the
park
in
the
direction
of
the
well
turning
before
he
entered
the
shadow
of
the
trees
to
look
back
at
the
lighted
windows
of
the
house
then
having
arranged
his
line
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
well
and
cautiously
lowered
it
he
sat
with
his
lips
compressed
occasionally
looking
about
him
in
a
startled
fashion
as
though
he
half
expected
to
see
something
peering
at
him
from
the
belt
of
trees
time
after
time
he
lowered
his
line
until
at
length
in
pulling
it
up
he
heard
a
little
metallic
tinkle
against
the
side
of
the
well
he
held
his
breath
then
and
forgetting
his
fears
drew
the
line
in
inch
by
inch
so
as
not
to
lose
its
precious
burden
his
pulse
beat
rapidly
and
his
eyes
were
bright
as
the
line
came
slowly
in
he
saw
the
catch
hanging
to
the
hook
and
with
a
steady
hand
drew
the
last
few
feet
in
then
he
saw
that
instead
of
the
bracelet
he
had
hooked
a
bunch
of
keys
with
a
faint
cry
he
shook
them
from
the
hook
into
the
water
below
and
stood
breathing
heavily
not
a
sound
broke
the
stillness
of
the
night
he
walked
up
and
down
a
bit
and
stretched
his
great
muscles
then
he
came
back
to
the
well
and
resumed
his
task
for
an
hour
or
more
the
line
was
lowered
without
result
in
his
eagerness
he
forgot
his
fears
and
with
eyes
bent
down
the
well
fished
slowly
and
carefully
twice
the
hook
became
entangled
in
something
and
was
with
difficulty
released
it
caught
a
third
time
and
all
his
efforts
failed'
to
free
it
then
he
dropped
the
line
down
the
well
and
with
head
bent
walked
toward
the
house
he
went
first
to
the
stables
at
the
rear
and
then
retiring
to
his
room
for
some
time
paced
restlessly
up
and
down
then
without
removing
his
clothes
he
flung
himself
upon
the
bed
and
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep
iii
long
before
anybody
else
was
astir
he
arose
and
stole
softly
downstairs
the
sunlight
was
stealing
in
at
every
crevice
and
flashing
in
long
streaks
across
the
darkened
rooms
the
dining-room
into
which
he
looked
struck
chill
and
cheerless
in
the
dark
yellow
light
which
came
through
the
lowered
blinds
he
remembered
that
it
had
the
same
appearance
when
his
father
lay
dead
in
the
house
now
as
then
everything
seemed
ghastly
and
unreal
the
very
chairs
standing
as
their
occupants
had
left
them
the
night
before
seemed
to
be
indulging
in
some
dark
communication
of
ideas
slowly
and
noiselessly
he
opened
the
hall
door
and
passed
into
the
fragrant
air
beyond
the
sun
was
shining
on
the
drenched
grass
and
trees
and
a
slowly
vanishing
white
mist
rolled
like
smoke
about
the
grounds
for
a
moment
he
stood
breathing
deeply
the
sweet
air
of
the
morning
and
then
walked
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
stables
the
rusty
creaking
of
a
pump-handle
and
a
spatter
of
water
upon
the
red-tiled
courtyard
showed
that
somebody
else
was
astir
and
a
few
steps
farther
he
beheld
a
brawny
sandy-haired
man
gasping
wildly
under
severe
self-infliction
at
the
pump
everything
ready
george
he
asked
quietly
yes
sir
said
the
man
straightening
up
suddenly
and
touching
his
forehead
bob's
just
finishing
the
arrangements
inside
it's
a
lovely
morning
for
a
dip
the
water
in
that
well
must
be
just
icy
be
as
quick
as
you
can
said
benson
impatiently
very
good
sir
said
george
burnishing
his
face
harshly
with
a
very
small
towel
which
had
been
hanging
over
the
top
of
the
pump
hurry
up
bob
in
answer
to
his
summons
a
man
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
stable
with
a
coil
of
stout
rope
over
his
arm
and
a
large
metal
candlestick
in
his
hand
just
to
try
the
air
sir
said
george
following
his
master's
glance
a
well
gets
rather
foul
sometimes
but
if
a
candle
can
live
down
it
a
man
can
his
master
nodded
and
the
man
hastily
pulling
up
the
neck
of
his
shirt
and
thrusting
his
arms
into
his
coat
followed
him
as
he
led
the
way
slowly
to
the
well
beg
pardon
sir
said
george
drawing
up
to
his
side
but
you
are
not
looking
over
and
above
well
this
morning
if
you'll
let
me
go
down
i'd
enjoy
the
bath
no
no
said
benson
peremptorily
you
ain't
fit
to
go
down
sir
persisted
his
follower
i've
never
seen
you
look
so
before
now
if--
mind
your
business
said
his
master
curtly
george
became
silent
and
the
three
walked
with
swinging
strides
through
the
long
wet
grass
to
the
well
bob
flung
the
rope
on
the
ground
and
at
a
sign
from
his
master
handed
him
the
candlestick
here's
the
line
for
it
sir
said
bob
fumbling
in
his
pockets
benson
took
it
from
him
and
slowly
tied
it
to
the
candlestick
then
he
placed
it
on
the
edge
of
the
well
and
striking
a
match
lit
the
candle
and
began
slowly
to
lower
it
hold
hard
sir
said
george
quickly
laying
his
hand
on
his
arm
you
must
tilt
it
or
the
string'll
burn
through
even
as
he
spoke
the
string
parted
and
the
candlestick
fell
into
the
water
below
benson
swore
quietly
i'll
soon
get
another
said
george
starting
up
never
mind
the
well's
all
right
said
benson
it
won't
take
a
moment
sir
said
the
other
over
his
shoulder
are
you
master
here
or
am
i
said
benson
hoarsely
george
came
back
slowly
a
glance
at
his
master's
face
stopping
the
protest
upon
his
tongue
and
he
stood
by
watching
him
sulkily
as
he
sat
on
the
well
and
removed
his
outer
garments
both
men
watched
him
curiously
as
having
completed
his
preparations
he
stood
grim
and
silent
with
his
hands
by
his
sides
i
wish
you'd
let
me
go
sir
said
george
plucking
up
courage
to
address
him
you
ain't
fit
to
go
you've
got
a
chill
or
something
i
shouldn't
wonder
it's
the
typhoid
they've
got
it
in
the
village
bad
for
a
moment
benson
looked
at
him
angrily
then
his
gaze
softened
not
this
time
george
he
said
quietly
he
took
the
looped
end
of
the
rope
and
placed
it
under
his
arms
and
sitting
down
threw
one
leg
over
the
side
of
the
well
how
are
you
going
about
it
sir
queried
george
laying
hold
of
the
rope
and
signing
to
bob
to
do
the
same
i'll
call
out
when
i
reach
the
water
said
benson
then
pay
out
three
yards
more
quickly
so
that
i
can
get
to
the
bottom
very
good
sir
answered
both
their
master
threw
the
other
leg
over
the
coping
and
sat
motionless
his
back
was
turned
toward
the
men
as
he
sat
with
head
bent
looking
down
the
shaft
he
sat
for
so
long
that
george
became
uneasy
all
right
sir
he
inquired
yes
said
benson
slowly
if
i
tug
at
the
rope
george
pull
up
at
once
lower
away
the
rope
passed
steadily
through
their
hands
until
a
hollow
cry
from
the
darkness
below
and
a
faint
splashing
warned
them
that
he
had
reached
the
water
they
gave
him
three
yards
more
and
stood
with
relaxed
grasp
and
strained
ears
waiting
he's
gone
under
said
bob
in
a
low
voice
the
other
nodded
and
moistening
his
huge
palms
took
a
firmer
grip
of
the
rope
fully
a
minute
passed
and
the
men
began
to
exchange
uneasy
glances
then
a
sudden
tremendous
jerk
followed
by
a
series
of
feebler
ones
nearly
tore
the
rope
from
their
grasp
pull
shouted
george
placing
one
foot
on
the
side
and
hauling
desperately
pull
pull
he's
stuck
fast
he's
not
coming
pull
in
response
to
their
terrific
exertions
the
rope
came
slowly
in
inch
by
inch
until
at
length
a
violent
splashing
was
heard
and
at
the
same
moment
a
scream
of
unutterable
horror
came
echoing
up
the
shaft
what
a
weight
he
is

panted
bob
he's
stuck
fast
or
something
keep
still
sir
for
heaven's
sake
keep
still
for
the
taut
rope
was
being
jerked
violently
by
the
struggles
of
the
weight
at
the
end
of
it
both
men
with
grunts
and
sighs
hauled
it
in
foot
by
foot
all
right
sir
cried
george
cheerfully
he
had
one
foot
against
the
well
and
was
pulling
manfully
the
burden
was
nearing
the
top
a
long
pull
and
a
strong
pull
and
the
face
of
a
dead
man
with
mud
in
the
eyes
and
nostrils
came
peering
over
the
edge
behind
it
was
the
ghastly
face
of
his
master
but
this
he
saw
too
late
for
with
a
great
cry
he
let
go
his
hold
of
the
rope
and
stepped
back
the
suddenness
overthrew
his
assistant
and
the
rope
tore
through
his
hands
there
was
a
frightful
splash
you
fool
stammered
bob
and
ran
to
the
well
helplessly
run
cried
george
run
for
another
line
he
bent
over
the
coping
and
called
eagerly
down
as
his
assistant
sped
back
to
the
stables
shouting
wildly
his
voice
re-echoed
down
the
shaft
but
all
else
was
silence
