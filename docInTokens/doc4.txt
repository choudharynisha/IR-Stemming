mr
utterson
the
lawyer
was
a
man
of
a
rugged
countenance
that
was
never
lighted
by
a
smile
cold
scanty
and
embarrassed
in
discourse
backward
in
sentiment
lean
long
dusty
dreary
and
yet
somehow
lovable
at
friendly
meetings
and
when
the
wine
was
to
his
taste
something
eminently
human
beaconed
from
his
eye
something
indeed
which
never
found
its
way
into
his
talk
but
which
spoke
not
only
in
these
silent
symbols
of
the
after-dinner
face
but
more
often
and
loudly
in
the
acts
of
his
life
he
was
austere
with
himself
drank
gin
when
he
was
alone
to
mortify
a
taste
for
vintages
and
though
he
enjoyed
the
theatre
had
not
crossed
the
doors
of
one
for
twenty
years
but
he
had
an
approved
tolerance
for
others
sometimes
wondering
almost
with
envy
at
the
high
pressure
of
spirits
involved
in
their
misdeeds
and
in
any
extremity
inclined
to
help
rather
than
to
reprove
2
i
incline
to
cain's
heresy
he
used
to
say
quaintly
i
let
my
brother
go
to
the
devil
in
his
own
way
in
this
character
it
was
frequently
his
fortune
to
be
the
last
reputable
acquaintance
and
the
last
good
influence
in
the
lives
of
down-going
men
and
to
such
as
these
so
long
as
they
came
about
his
chambers
he
never
marked
a
shade
of
change
in
his
demeanour
no
doubt
the
feat
was
easy
to
mr
utterson
for
he
was
undemonstrative
at
the
best
and
even
his
friendship
seemed
to
be
founded
in
a
similar
catholicity
of
good-nature
it
is
the
mark
of
a
modest
man
to
accept
his
friendly
circle
ready-made
from
the
hands
of
opportunity
and
that
was
the
lawyer's
way
his
friends
were
those
of
his
own
blood
or
those
whom
he
had
known
the
longest
his
affections
like
ivy
were
the
growth
of
time
they
implied
no
aptness
in
the
object
hence
no
doubt
the
bond
that
united
him
to
mr
richard
enfield
his
distant
kinsman
the
well-known
man
about
town
it
was
a
nut
to
crack
for
many
what
these
two
could
see
in
each
other
or
what
subject
they
could
find
in
common
it
was
reported
by
those
who
encountered
them
in
their
sunday
walks
that
they
said
nothing
looked
singularly
dull
and
would
hail
with
obvious
relief
the
appearance
of
a
friend
for
all
that
the
two
men
put
the
greatest
store
by
these
excursions
counted
them
the
chief
jewel
of
each
week
and
not
only
set
aside
occasions
of
pleasure
but
even
resisted
the
calls
3
of
business
that
they
might
enjoy
them
uninterrupted
it
chanced
on
one
of
these
rambles
that
their
way
led
them
down
a
by-street
in
a
busy
quarter
of
london
the
street
was
small
and
what
is
called
quiet
but
it
drove
a
thriving
trade
on
the
week-days
the
inhabitants
were
all
doing
well
it
seemed
and
all
emulously
hoping
to
do
better
still
and
laying
out
the
surplus
of
their
gains
in
coquetry
so
that
the
shop
fronts
stood
along
that
thoroughfare
with
an
air
of
invitation
like
rows
of
smiling
saleswomen
even
on
sunday
when
it
veiled
its
more
florid
charms
and
lay
comparatively
empty
of
passage
the
street
shone
out
in
contrast
to
its
dingy
neighbourhood
like
a
fire
in
a
forest
and
with
its
freshly
painted
shutters
well-polished
brasses
and
general
cleanliness
and
gaiety
of
note
instantly
caught
and
pleased
the
eye
of
the
passenger
two
doors
from
one
corner
on
the
left
hand
going
east
the
line
was
broken
by
the
entry
of
a
court
and
just
at
that
point
a
certain
sinister
block
of
building
thrust
forward
its
gable
on
the
street
it
was
two
stories
high
showed
no
window
nothing
but
a
door
on
the
lower
story
and
a
blind
forehead
of
discoloured
wall
on
the
upper
and
bore
in
every
feature
the
marks
of
prolonged
and
sordid
negligence
the
door
which
was
equipped
with
neither
bell
nor
knocker
was
blistered
and
distained
tramps
slouched
into
the
recess
and
struck
matches
on
4
the
panels
children
kept
shop
upon
the
steps
the
schoolboy
had
tried
his
knife
on
the
mouldings
and
for
close
on
a
generation
no
one
had
appeared
to
drive
away
these
random
visitors
or
to
repair
their
ravages
mr
enfield
and
the
lawyer
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
by-street
but
when
they
came
abreast
of
the
entry
the
former
lifted
up
his
cane
and
pointed
did
you
ever
remark
that
door
he
asked
and
when
his
companion
had
replied
in
the
affirmative
it
is
connected
in
my
mind
added
he
with
a
very
odd
story
indeed
said
mr
utterson
with
a
slight
change
of
voice
and
what
was
that
well
it
was
this
way
returned
mr
enfield
i
was
coming
home
from
some
place
at
the
end
of
the
world
about
three
o'clock
of
a
black
winter
morning
and
my
way
lay
through
a
part
of
town
where
there
was
literally
nothing
to
be
seen
but
lamps
street
after
street
and
all
the
folks
asleep--street
after
street
all
lighted
up
as
if
for
a
procession
and
all
as
empty
as
a
church--till
at
last
i
got
into
that
state
of
mind
when
a
man
listens
and
listens
and
begins
to
long
for
the
sight
of
a
policeman
all
at
once
i
saw
two
figures
one
a
little
man
who
was
stumping
along
eastward
at
a
good
walk
and
the
other
a
girl
of
maybe
eight
or
ten
who
was
running
as
hard
as
she
was
able
down
a
cross
street
well
sir
the
two
ran
into
one
another
naturally
enough
at
the
5
corner
and
then
came
the
horrible
part
of
the
thing
for
the
man
trampled
calmly
over
the
child's
body
and
left
her
screaming
on
the
ground
it
sounds
nothing
to
hear
but
it
was
hellish
to
see
it
wasn't
like
a
man
it
was
like
some
damned
juggernaut
i
gave
a
view-halloa
took
to
my
heels
collared
my
gentleman
and
brought
him
back
to
where
there
was
already
quite
a
group
about
the
screaming
child
he
was
perfectly
cool
and
made
no
resistance
but
gave
me
one
look
so
ugly
that
it
brought
out
the
sweat
on
me
like
running
the
people
who
had
turned
out
were
the
girl's
own
family
and
pretty
soon
the
doctor
for
whom
she
had
been
sent
put
in
his
appearance
well
the
child
was
not
much
the
worse
more
frightened
according
to
the
sawbones
and
there
you
might
have
supposed
would
be
an
end
to
it
but
there
was
one
curious
circumstance
i
had
taken
a
loathing
to
my
gentleman
at
first
sight
so
had
the
child's
family
which
was
only
natural
but
the
doctor's
case
was
what
struck
me
he
was
the
usual
cut-and-dry
apothecary
of
no
particular
age
and
colour
with
a
strong
edinburgh
accent
and
about
as
emotional
as
a
bagpipe
well
sir
he
was
like
the
rest
of
us
every
time
he
looked
at
my
prisoner
i
saw
that
sawbones
turn
sick
and
white
with
the
desire
to
kill
him
i
knew
what
was
in
his
mind
just
as
he
knew
what
was
in
mine
and
killing
being
out
of
the
question
we
did
the
next
best
we
told
the
man
we
could
6
and
would
make
such
a
scandal
out
of
this
as
should
make
his
name
stink
from
one
end
of
london
to
the
other
if
he
had
any
friends
or
any
credit
we
undertook
that
he
should
lose
them
and
all
the
time
as
we
were
pitching
it
in
red
hot
we
were
keeping
the
women
off
him
as
best
we
could
for
they
were
as
wild
as
harpies
i
never
saw
a
circle
of
such
hateful
faces
and
there
was
the
man
in
the
middle
with
a
kind
of
black
sneering
coolness--frightened
too
i
could
see
that--but
carrying
it
off
sir
really
like
satan
'if
you
choose
to
make
capital
out
of
this
accident'
said
he
'i
am
naturally
helpless
no
gentleman
but
wishes
to
avoid
a
scene'
says
he
'name
your
figure'
well
we
screwed
him
up
to
a
hundred
pounds
for
the
child's
family
he
would
have
clearly
liked
to
stick
out
but
there
was
something
about
the
lot
of
us
that
meant
mischief
and
at
last
he
struck
the
next
thing
was
to
get
the
money
and
where
do
you
think
he
carried
us
but
to
that
place
with
the
door--
whipped
out
a
key
went
in
and
presently
came
back
with
the
matter
of
ten
pounds
in
gold
and
a
cheque
for
the
balance
on
coutts's
drawn
payable
to
bearer
and
signed
with
a
name
that
i
can't
mention
though
it's
one
of
the
points
of
my
story
but
it
was
a
name
at
least
very
well
known
and
often
printed
the
figure
was
stiff
but
the
signature
was
good
for
more
than
that
if
it
was
only
genuine
i
took
the
liberty
of
pointing
out
to
my
gentleman
that
the
whole
7
business
looked
apocryphal
and
that
a
man
does
not
in
real
life
walk
into
a
cellar
door
at
four
in
the
morning
and
come
out
of
it
with
another
man's
cheque
for
close
upon
a
hundred
pounds
but
he
was
quite
easy
and
sneering
'set
your
mind
at
rest'
says
he
'i
will
stay
with
you
till
the
banks
open
and
cash
the
cheque
myself'
so
we
all
set
off
the
doctor
and
the
child's
father
and
our
friend
and
myself
and
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
in
my
chambers
and
next
day
when
we
had
breakfasted
went
in
a
body
to
the
bank
i
gave
in
the
check
myself
and
said
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
it
was
a
forgery
not
a
bit
of
it
the
cheque
was
genuine
tut-tut
said
mr
utterson
i
see
you
feel
as
i
do
said
mr
enfield
yes
it's
a
bad
story
for
my
man
was
a
fellow
that
nobody
could
have
to
do
with
a
really
damnable
man
and
the
person
that
drew
the
cheque
is
the
very
pink
of
the
proprieties
celebrated
too
and
what
makes
it
worse
one
of
your
fellows
who
do
what
they
call
good
black-mail
i
suppose
an
honest
man
paying
through
the
nose
for
some
of
the
capers
of
his
youth
black-mail
house
is
what
i
call
that
place
with
the
door
in
consequence
though
even
that
you
know
is
far
from
explaining
all
he
added
and
with
the
words
fell
into
a
vein
of
musing
from
this
he
was
recalled
by
mr
utterson
asking
rather
suddenly
and
you
don't
know
if
the
drawer
of
the
cheque
lives
there
8
a
likely
place
isn't
it
returned
mr
enfield
but
i
happen
to
have
noticed
his
address
he
lives
in
some
square
or
other
and
you
never
asked
about
the--place
with
the
door
said
mr
utterson
no
sir
i
had
a
delicacy
was
the
reply
i
feel
very
strongly
about
putting
questions
it
partakes
too
much
of
the
style
of
the
day
of
judgment
you
start
a
question
and
it's
like
starting
a
stone
you
sit
quietly
on
the
top
of
a
hill
and
away
the
stone
goes
starting
others
and
presently
some
bland
old
bird
the
last
you
would
have
thought
of
is
knocked
on
the
head
in
his
own
back-garden
and
the
family
have
to
change
their
name
no
sir
i
make
it
a
rule
of
mine
the
more
it
looks
like
queer
street
the
less
i
ask
a
very
good
rule
too
said
the
lawyer
but
i
have
studied
the
place
for
myself
continued
mr
enfield
it
seems
scarcely
a
house
there
is
no
other
door
and
nobody
goes
in
or
out
of
that
one
but
once
in
a
great
while
the
gentleman
of
my
adventure
there
are
three
windows
looking
on
the
court
on
the
first
floor
none
below
the
windows
are
always
shut
but
they're
clean
and
then
there
is
a
chimney
which
is
generally
smoking
so
somebody
must
live
there
and
yet
it's
not
so
sure
for
the
buildings
are
so
packed
together
about
that
court
that
it's
hard
to
say
where
one
ends
and
another
begins
9
the
pair
walked
on
again
for
a
while
in
silence
and
then
enfield
said
mr
utterson
that's
a
good
rule
of
yours
yes
i
think
it
is
returned
enfield
but
for
all
that
continued
the
lawyer
there's
one
point
i
want
to
ask
i
want
to
ask
the
name
of
that
man
who
walked
over
the
child
well
said
mr
enfield
i
can't
see
what
harm
it
would
do
it
was
a
man
of
the
name
of
hyde
h'm
said
mr
utterson
what
sort
of
a
man
is
he
to
see
he
is
not
easy
to
describe
there
is
something
wrong
with
his
appearance
something
displeasing
something
downright
detestable
i
never
saw
a
man
i
so
disliked
and
yet
i
scarce
know
why
he
must
be
deformed
somewhere
he
gives
a
strong
feeling
of
deformity
although
i
couldn't
specify
the
point
he's
an
extraordinary-looking
man
and
yet
i
really
can
name
nothing
out
of
the
way
no
sir
i
can
make
no
hand
of
it
i
can't
describe
him
and
it's
not
want
of
memory
for
i
declare
i
can
see
him
this
moment
mr
utterson
again
walked
some
way
in
silence
and
obviously
under
a
weight
of
consideration
you
are
sure
he
used
a
key
he
inquired
at
last
my
dear
sir
began
enfield
surprised
out
of
himself
10
yes
i
know
said
utterson
i
know
it
must
seem
strange
the
fact
is
if
i
do
not
ask
you
the
name
of
the
other
party
it
is
because
i
know
it
already
you
see
richard
your
tale
has
gone
home
if
you
have
been
inexact
in
any
point
you
had
better
correct
it
i
think
you
might
have
warned
me
returned
the
other
with
a
touch
of
sullenness
but
i
have
been
pedantically
exact
as
you
call
it
the
fellow
had
a
key
and
what's
more
he
has
it
still
i
saw
him
use
it
not
a
week
ago
mr
utterson
sighed
deeply
but
said
never
a
word
and
the
young
man
presently
resumed
here
is
another
lesson
to
say
nothing
said
he
i
am
ashamed
of
my
long
tongue
let
us
make
a
bargain
never
to
refer
to
this
again
with
all
my
heart
said
the
lawyer
i
shake
hands
on
that
richard
11
search
for
mr
hyde
that
evening
mr
utterson
came
home
to
his
bachelor
house
in
sombre
spirits
and
sat
down
to
dinner
without
relish
it
was
his
custom
of
a
sunday
when
this
meal
was
over
to
sit
close
by
the
fire
a
volume
of
some
dry
divinity
on
his
reading-desk
until
the
clock
of
the
neighbouring
church
rang
out
the
hour
of
twelve
when
he
would
go
soberly
and
gratefully
to
bed
on
this
night
however
as
soon
as
the
cloth
was
taken
away
he
took
up
a
candle
and
went
into
his
business-room
there
he
opened
his
safe
took
from
the
most
private
part
of
it
a
document
endorsed
on
the
envelope
as
dr
jekyll's
will
and
sat
down
with
a
clouded
brow
to
study
its
contents
the
will
was
holograph
for
mr
utterson
though
he
took
charge
of
it
now
that
it
was
made
had
refused
to
lend
the
least
assistance
in
the
making
of
it
it
provided
not
only
that
in
case
of
the
decease
of
henry
jekyll
md
dcl
lld
frs
etc
all
his
possessions
were
to
pass
into
the
hands
of
his
friend
and
benefactor
edward
hyde
but
that
in
case
of
12
dr
jekyll's
disappearance
or
unexplained
absence
for
any
period
exceeding
three
calendar
months
the
said
edward
hyde
should
step
into
the
said
henry
jekyll's
shoes
without
further
delay
and
free
from
any
burthen
or
obligation
beyond
the
payment
of
a
few
small
sums
to
the
members
of
the
doctor's
household
this
document
had
long
been
the
lawyer's
eyesore
it
offended
him
both
as
a
lawyer
and
as
a
lover
of
the
sane
and
customary
sides
of
life
to
whom
the
fanciful
was
the
immodest
and
hitherto
it
was
his
ignorance
of
mr
hyde
that
had
swelled
his
indignation
now
by
a
sudden
turn
it
was
his
knowledge
it
was
already
bad
enough
when
the
name
was
but
a
name
of
which
he
could
learn
no
more
it
was
worse
when
it
began
to
be
clothed
upon
with
detestable
attributes
and
out
of
the
shifting
insubstantial
mists
that
had
so
long
baffled
his
eye
there
leaped
up
the
sudden
definite
presentment
of
a
fiend
i
thought
it
was
madness
he
said
as
he
replaced
the
obnoxious
paper
in
the
safe
and
now
i
begin
to
fear
it
is
disgrace
with
that
he
blew
out
his
candle
put
on
a
great-coat
and
set
forth
in
the
direction
of
cavendish
square
that
citadel
of
medicine
where
his
friend
the
great
dr
lanyon
had
his
house
and
received
his
crowding
patients
if
any
one
knows
it
will
be
lanyon
he
had
thought
the
solemn
butler
knew
and
welcomed
him
13
he
was
subjected
to
no
stage
of
delay
but
ushered
direct
from
the
door
to
the
dining-room
where
dr
lanyon
sat
alone
over
his
wine
this
was
a
hearty
healthy
dapper
red-faced
gentleman
with
a
shock
of
hair
prematurely
white
and
a
boisterous
and
decided
manner
at
sight
of
mr
utterson
he
sprang
up
from
his
chair
and
welcomed
him
with
both
hands
the
geniality
as
was
the
way
of
the
man
was
somewhat
theatrical
to
the
eye
but
it
reposed
on
genuine
feeling
for
these
two
were
old
friends
old
mates
both
at
school
and
college
both
thorough
respecters
of
themselves
and
of
each
other
and
what
does
not
always
follow
men
who
thoroughly
enjoyed
each
other's
company
after
a
little
rambling
talk
the
lawyer
led
up
to
the
subject
which
so
disagreeably
pre-occupied
his
mind
i
suppose
lanyon
said
he
you
and
i
must
be
the
two
oldest
friends
that
henry
jekyll
has
i
wish
the
friends
were
younger
chuckled
dr
lanyon
but
i
suppose
we
are
and
what
of
that
i
see
little
of
him
now
indeed
said
utterson
i
thought
you
had
a
bond
of
common
interest
we
had
was
the
reply
but
it
is
more
than
ten
years
since
henry
jekyll
became
too
fanciful
for
me
he
began
to
go
wrong
wrong
in
mind
and
though
of
course
i
continue
to
take
an
interest
in
him
for
old
sake's
sake
as
they
say
14
i
see
and
i
have
seen
devilish
little
of
the
man
such
unscientific
balderdash
added
the
doctor
flushing
suddenly
purple
would
have
estranged
damon
and
pythias
this
little
spirit
of
temper
was
somewhat
of
a
relief
to
mr
utterson
they
have
only
differed
on
some
point
of
science
he
thought
and
being
a
man
of
no
scientific
passions
except
in
the
matter
of
conveyancing
he
even
added
it
is
nothing
worse
than
that
he
gave
his
friend
a
few
seconds
to
recover
his
composure
and
then
approached
the
question
he
had
come
to
put
did
you
ever
come
across
a
protege
of
his--one
hyde
he
asked
hyde
repeated
lanyon
no
never
heard
of
him
since
my
time
that
was
the
amount
of
information
that
the
lawyer
carried
back
with
him
to
the
great
dark
bed
on
which
he
tossed
to
and
fro
until
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
began
to
grow
large
it
was
a
night
of
little
ease
to
his
toiling
mind
toiling
in
mere
darkness
and
besieged
by
questions
six
o'clock
struck
on
the
bells
of
the
church
that
was
so
conveniently
near
to
mr
utterson's
dwelling
and
still
he
was
digging
at
the
problem
hitherto
it
had
touched
him
on
the
intellectual
side
alone
but
now
his
imagination
also
was
engaged
or
rather
enslaved
and
as
he
lay
and
tossed
in
the
gross
darkness
of
the
night
and
the
curtained
room
mr
enfield's
tale
went
by
15
before
his
mind
in
a
scroll
of
lighted
pictures
he
would
be
aware
of
the
great
field
of
lamps
of
a
nocturnal
city
then
of
the
figure
of
a
man
walking
swiftly
then
of
a
child
running
from
the
doctor's
and
then
these
met
and
that
human
juggernaut
trod
the
child
down
and
passed
on
regardless
of
her
screams
or
else
he
would
see
a
room
in
a
rich
house
where
his
friend
lay
asleep
dreaming
and
smiling
at
his
dreams
and
then
the
door
of
that
room
would
be
opened
the
curtains
of
the
bed
plucked
apart
the
sleeper
recalled
and
lo
there
would
stand
by
his
side
a
figure
to
whom
power
was
given
and
even
at
that
dead
hour
he
must
rise
and
do
its
bidding
the
figure
in
these
two
phases
haunted
the
lawyer
all
night
and
if
at
any
time
he
dozed
over
it
was
but
to
see
it
glide
more
stealthily
through
sleeping
houses
or
move
the
more
swiftly
and
still
the
more
swiftly
even
to
dizziness
through
wider
labyrinths
of
lamplighted
city
and
at
every
street-corner
crush
a
child
and
leave
her
screaming
and
still
the
figure
had
no
face
by
which
he
might
know
it
even
in
his
dreams
it
had
no
face
or
one
that
baffled
him
and
melted
before
his
eyes
and
thus
it
was
that
there
sprang
up
and
grew
apace
in
the
lawyer's
mind
a
singularly
strong
almost
an
inordinate
curiosity
to
behold
the
features
of
the
real
mr
hyde
if
he
could
but
once
set
eyes
on
him
he
thought
the
mystery
would
lighten
and
perhaps
roll
altogether
away
as
was
the
habit
of
mysterious
16
things
when
well
examined
he
might
see
a
reason
for
his
friend's
strange
preference
or
bondage
call
it
which
you
please
and
even
for
the
startling
clause
of
the
will
at
least
it
would
be
a
face
worth
seeing
the
face
of
a
man
who
was
without
bowels
of
mercy
a
face
which
had
but
to
show
itself
to
raise
up
in
the
mind
of
the
unimpressionable
enfield
a
spirit
of
enduring
hatred
from
that
time
forward
mr
utterson
began
to
haunt
the
door
in
the
by-street
of
shops
in
the
morning
before
office
hours
at
noon
when
business
was
plenty
and
time
scarce
at
night
under
the
face
of
the
fogged
city
moon
by
all
lights
and
at
all
hours
of
solitude
or
concourse
the
lawyer
was
to
be
found
on
his
chosen
post
if
he
be
mr
hyde
he
had
thought
i
shall
be
mr
seek
and
at
last
his
patience
was
rewarded
it
was
a
fine
dry
night
frost
in
the
air
the
streets
as
clean
as
a
ballroom
floor
the
lamps
unshaken
by
any
wind
drawing
a
regular
pattern
of
light
and
shadow
by
ten
o'clock
when
the
shops
were
closed
the
by-street
was
very
solitary
and
in
spite
of
the
low
growl
of
london
from
all
round
very
silent
small
sounds
carried
far
domestic
sounds
out
of
the
houses
were
clearly
audible
on
either
side
of
the
roadway
and
the
rumour
of
the
approach
of
any
passenger
preceded
him
by
a
long
time
mr
utterson
had
been
some
minutes
at
his
post
when
he
was
17
aware
of
an
odd
light
footstep
drawing
near
in
the
course
of
his
nightly
patrols
he
had
long
grown
accustomed
to
the
quaint
effect
with
which
the
footfalls
of
a
single
person
while
he
is
still
a
great
way
off
suddenly
spring
out
distinct
from
the
vast
hum
and
clatter
of
the
city
yet
his
attention
had
never
before
been
so
sharply
and
decisively
arrested
and
it
was
with
a
strong
superstitious
prevision
of
success
that
he
withdrew
into
the
entry
of
the
court
the
steps
drew
swiftly
nearer
and
swelled
out
suddenly
louder
as
they
turned
the
end
of
the
street
the
lawyer
looking
forth
from
the
entry
could
soon
see
what
manner
of
man
he
had
to
deal
with
he
was
small
and
very
plainly
dressed
and
the
look
of
him
even
at
that
distance
went
somehow
strongly
against
the
watcher's
inclination
but
he
made
straight
for
the
door
crossing
the
roadway
to
save
time
and
as
he
came
he
drew
a
key
from
his
pocket
like
one
approaching
home
mr
utterson
stepped
out
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
as
he
passed
mr
hyde
i
think
mr
hyde
shrank
back
with
a
hissing
intake
of
the
breath
but
his
fear
was
only
momentary
and
though
he
did
not
look
the
lawyer
in
the
face
he
answered
coolly
enough
that
is
my
name
what
do
you
want
i
see
you
are
going
in
returned
the
lawyer
i
am
an
old
friend
of
dr
jekyll's--mr
utter-
18
son
of
gaunt
street--you
must
have
heard
my
name
and
meeting
you
so
conveniently
i
thought
you
might
admit
me
you
will
not
find
dr
jekyll
he
is
from
home
replied
mr
hyde
blowing
in
the
key
and
then
suddenly
but
still
without
looking
up
how
did
you
know
me
he
asked
on
your
side
said
mr
utterson
will
you
do
me
a
favour
with
pleasure
replied
the
other
what
shall
it
be
will
you
let
me
see
your
face
asked
the
lawyer
mr
hyde
appeared
to
hesitate
and
then
as
if
upon
some
sudden
reflection
fronted
about
with
an
air
of
defiance
and
the
pair
stared
at
each
other
pretty
fixedly
for
a
few
seconds
now
i
shall
know
you
again
said
mr
utterson
it
may
be
useful
yes
returned
mr
hyde
it
is
as
well
we
have
met
and
a
propos
you
should
have
my
address
and
he
gave
a
number
of
a
street
in
soho
good
god
thought
mr
utterson
can
he
too
have
been
thinking
of
the
will
but
he
kept
his
feelings
to
himself
and
only
grunted
in
acknowledgment
of
the
address
and
now
said
the
other
how
did
you
know
me
by
description
was
the
reply
whose
description
19
we
have
common
friends
said
mr
utterson
common
friends
echoed
mr
hyde
a
little
hoarsely
who
are
they
jekyll
for
instance
said
the
lawyer
he
never
told
you
cried
mr
hyde
with
a
flush
of
anger
i
did
not
think
you
would
have
lied
come
said
mr
utterson
that
is
not
fitting
language
the
other
snarled
aloud
into
a
savage
laugh
and
the
next
moment
with
extraordinary
quickness
he
had
unlocked
the
door
and
disappeared
into
the
house
the
lawyer
stood
awhile
when
mr
hyde
had
left
him
the
picture
of
disquietude
then
he
began
slowly
to
mount
the
street
pausing
every
step
or
two
and
putting
his
hand
to
his
brow
like
a
man
in
mental
perplexity
the
problem
he
was
thus
debating
as
he
walked
was
one
of
a
class
that
is
rarely
solved
mr
hyde
was
pale
and
dwarfish
he
gave
an
impression
of
deformity
without
any
nameable
malformation
he
had
a
displeasing
smile
he
had
borne
himself
to
the
lawyer
with
a
sort
of
murderous
mixture
of
timidity
and
boldness
and
he
spoke
with
a
husky
whispering
and
somewhat
broken
voice
all
these
were
points
against
him
but
not
all
of
these
together
could
explain
the
hitherto
unknown
disgust
loathing
and
fear
with
which
mr
utterson
regarded
him
there
must
be
some-
20
thing
else
said
the
perplexed
gentleman
there
is
something
more
if
i
could
find
a
name
for
it
god
bless
me
the
man
seems
hardly
human
something
troglodytic
shall
we
say
or
can
it
be
the
old
story
of
dr
fell
or
is
it
the
mere
radiance
of
a
foul
soul
that
thus
transpires
through
and
transfigures
its
clay
continent
the
last
i
think
for
o
my
poor
old
harry
jekyll
if
ever
i
read
satan's
signature
upon
a
face
it
is
on
that
of
your
new
friend
round
the
corner
from
the
by-street
there
was
a
square
of
ancient
handsome
houses
now
for
the
most
part
decayed
from
their
high
estate
and
let
in
flats
and
chambers
to
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
map-engravers
architects
shady
lawyers
and
the
agents
of
obscure
enterprises
one
house
however
second
from
the
corner
was
still
occupied
entire
and
at
the
door
of
this
which
wore
a
great
air
of
wealth
and
comfort
though
it
was
now
plunged
in
darkness
except
for
the
fan-light
mr
utterson
stopped
and
knocked
a
well-dressed
elderly
servant
opened
the
door
is
dr
jekyll
at
home
poole
asked
the
lawyer
i
will
see
mr
utterson
said
poole
admitting
the
visitor
as
he
spoke
into
a
large
low-roofed
comfortable
hall
paved
with
flags
warmed
after
the
fashion
of
a
country
house
by
a
bright
open
fire
and
furnished
with
costly
cabinets
of
oak
will
you
wait
here
by
the
21
fire
sir
or
shall
i
give
you
a
light
in
the
dining
room
here
thank
you
said
the
lawyer
and
he
drew
near
and
leaned
on
the
tall
fender
this
hall
in
which
he
was
now
left
alone
was
a
pet
fancy
of
his
friend
the
doctor's
and
utterson
himself
was
wont
to
speak
of
it
as
the
pleasantest
room
in
london
but
to-night
there
was
a
shudder
in
his
blood
the
face
of
hyde
sat
heavy
on
his
memory
he
felt
what
was
rare
with
him
a
nausea
and
distaste
of
life
and
in
the
gloom
of
his
spirits
he
seemed
to
read
a
menace
in
the
flickering
of
the
firelight
on
the
polished
cabinets
and
the
uneasy
starting
of
the
shadow
on
the
roof
he
was
ashamed
of
his
relief
when
poole
presently
returned
to
announce
that
dr
jekyll
was
gone
out
i
saw
mr
hyde
go
in
by
the
old
dissecting-room
door
poole
he
said
is
that
right
when
dr
jekyll
is
from
home
quite
right
mr
utterson
sir
replied
the
servant
mr
hyde
has
a
key
your
master
seems
to
repose
a
great
deal
of
trust
in
that
young
man
poole
resumed
the
other
musingly
yes
sir
he
do
indeed
said
poole
we
have
all
orders
to
obey
him
i
do
not
think
i
ever
met
mr
hyde
asked
utterson
o
dear
no
sir
he
never
dines
here
replied
the
butler
indeed
we
see
very
little
of
22
him
on
this
side
of
the
house
he
mostly
comes
and
goes
by
the
laboratory
well
good-night
poole
good-night
mr
utterson
and
the
lawyer
set
out
homeward
with
a
very
heavy
heart
poor
harry
jekyll
he
thought
my
mind
misgives
me
he
is
in
deep
waters
he
was
wild
when
he
was
young
a
long
while
ago
to
be
sure
but
in
the
law
of
god
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
ay
it
must
be
that
the
ghost
of
some
old
sin
the
cancer
of
some
concealed
disgrace
punishment
coming
pede
claudo
years
after
memory
has
forgotten
and
self-love
condoned
the
fault
and
the
lawyer
scared
by
the
thought
brooded
a
while
on
his
own
past
groping
in
all
the
corners
of
memory
lest
by
chance
some
jack-in-the-box
of
an
old
iniquity
should
leap
to
light
there
his
past
was
fairly
blameless
few
men
could
read
the
rolls
of
their
life
with
less
apprehension
yet
he
was
humbled
to
the
dust
by
the
many
ill
things
he
had
done
and
raised
up
again
into
a
sober
and
fearful
gratitude
by
the
many
that
he
had
come
so
near
to
doing
yet
avoided
and
then
by
a
return
on
his
former
subject
he
conceived
a
spark
of
hope
this
master
hyde
if
he
were
studied
thought
he
must
have
secrets
of
his
own
black
secrets
by
the
look
of
him
secrets
compared
to
which
poor
jekyll's
worst
would
be
like
sunshine
things
cannot
continue
as
they
are
it
turns
me
cold
to
think
of
this
creature
stealing
like
a
23
thief
to
harry's
bedside
poor
harry
what
a
wakening
and
the
danger
of
it
for
if
this
hyde
suspects
the
existence
of
the
will
he
may
grow
impatient
to
inherit
ay
i
must
put
my
shoulder
to
the
wheel
if
jekyll
will
but
let
me
he
added
if
jekyll
will
only
let
me
for
once
more
he
saw
before
his
mind's
eye
as
clear
as
a
transparency
the
strange
clauses
of
the
will
24
dr
jekyll
was
quite
at
ease
a
fortnight
later
by
excellent
good
fortune
the
doctor
gave
one
of
his
pleasant
dinners
to
some
five
or
six
old
cronies
all
intelligent
reputable
men
and
all
judges
of
good
wine
and
mr
utterson
so
contrived
that
he
remained
behind
after
the
others
had
departed
this
was
no
new
arrangement
but
a
thing
that
had
befallen
many
scores
of
times
where
utterson
was
liked
he
was
liked
well
hosts
loved
to
detain
the
dry
lawyer
when
the
light-hearted
and
the
loose-tongued
had
already
their
foot
on
the
threshold
they
liked
to
sit
a
while
in
his
unobtrusive
company
practising
for
solitude
sobering
their
minds
in
the
man's
rich
silence
after
the
expense
and
strain
of
gaiety
to
this
rule
dr
jekyll
was
no
exception
and
as
he
now
sat
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire--a
large
well-made
smooth-faced
man
of
fifty
with
something
of
a
slyish
cast
perhaps
but
every
mark
of
capacity
and
kindness--you
could
see
by
his
looks
that
he
cherished
for
mr
utterson
a
sincere
and
warm
affection
25
i
have
been
wanting
to
speak
to
you
jekyll
began
the
latter
you
know
that
will
of
yours
a
close
observer
might
have
gathered
that
the
topic
was
distasteful
but
the
doctor
carried
it
off
gaily
my
poor
utterson
said
he
you
are
unfortunate
in
such
a
client
i
never
saw
a
man
so
distressed
as
you
were
by
my
will
unless
it
were
that
hide-bound
pedant
lanyon
at
what
he
called
my
scientific
heresies
oh
i
know
he's
a
good
fellow--you
needn't
frown--an
excellent
fellow
and
i
always
mean
to
see
more
of
him
but
a
hide-bound
pedant
for
all
that
an
ignorant
blatant
pedant
i
was
never
more
disappointed
in
any
man
than
lanyon
you
know
i
never
approved
of
it
pursued
utterson
ruthlessly
disregarding
the
fresh
topic
my
will
yes
certainly
i
know
that
said
the
doctor
a
trifle
sharply
you
have
told
me
so
well
i
tell
you
so
again
continued
the
lawyer
i
have
been
learning
something
of
young
hyde
the
large
handsome
face
of
dr
jekyll
grew
pale
to
the
very
lips
and
there
came
a
blackness
about
his
eyes
i
do
not
care
to
hear
more
said
he
this
is
a
matter
i
thought
we
had
agreed
to
drop
what
i
heard
was
abominable
said
utterson
it
can
make
no
change
you
do
not
under-
26
stand
my
position
returned
the
doctor
with
a
certain
incoherency
of
manner
i
am
painfully
situated
utterson
my
position
is
a
very
strange--a
very
strange
one
it
is
one
of
those
affairs
that
cannot
be
mended
by
talking
jekyll
said
utterson
you
know
me
i
am
a
man
to
be
trusted
make
a
clean
breast
of
this
in
confidence
and
i
make
no
doubt
i
can
get
you
out
of
it
my
good
utterson
said
the
doctor
this
is
very
good
of
you
this
is
downright
good
of
you
and
i
cannot
find
words
to
thank
you
in
i
believe
you
fully
i
would
trust
you
before
any
man
alive
ay
before
myself
if
i
could
make
the
choice
but
indeed
it
isn't
what
you
fancy
it
is
not
so
bad
as
that
and
just
to
put
your
good
heart
at
rest
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
the
moment
i
choose
i
can
be
rid
of
mr
hyde
i
give
you
my
hand
upon
that
and
i
thank
you
again
and
again
and
i
will
just
add
one
little
word
utterson
that
i'm
sure
you'll
take
in
good
part
this
is
a
private
matter
and
i
beg
of
you
to
let
it
sleep
utterson
reflected
a
little
looking
in
the
fire
i
have
no
doubt
you
are
perfectly
right
he
said
at
last
getting
to
his
feet
well
but
since
we
have
touched
upon
this
business
and
for
the
last
time
i
hope
continued
the
doctor
there
is
one
point
i
should
like
you
to
understand
i
have
really
a
very
great
interest
in
poor
hyde
i
know
you
have
seen
27
him
he
told
me
so
and
i
fear
he
was
rude
but
i
do
sincerely
take
a
great
a
very
great
interest
in
that
young
man
and
if
i
am
taken
away
utterson
i
wish
you
to
promise
me
that
you
will
bear
with
him
and
get
his
rights
for
him
i
think
you
would
if
you
knew
all
and
it
would
be
a
weight
off
my
mind
if
you
would
promise
i
can't
pretend
that
i
shall
ever
like
him
said
the
lawyer
i
don't
ask
that
pleaded
jekyll
laying
his
hand
upon
the
other's
arm
i
only
ask
for
justice
i
only
ask
you
to
help
him
for
my
sake
when
i
am
no
longer
here
utterson
heaved
an
irrepressible
sigh
well
said
he
i
promise
28
the
carew
murder
case
nearly
a
year
later
in
the
month
of
october
18---
london
was
startled
by
a
crime
of
singular
ferocity
and
rendered
all
the
more
notable
by
the
high
position
of
the
victim
the
details
were
few
and
startling
a
maid
servant
living
alone
in
a
house
not
far
from
the
river
had
gone
up-stairs
to
bed
about
eleven
although
a
fog
rolled
over
the
city
in
the
small
hours
the
early
part
of
the
night
was
cloudless
and
the
lane
which
the
maid's
window
overlooked
was
brilliantly
lit
by
the
full
moon
it
seems
she
was
romantically
given
for
she
sat
down
upon
her
box
which
stood
immediately
under
the
window
and
fell
into
a
dream
of
musing
never
she
used
to
say
with
streaming
tears
when
she
narrated
that
experience
never
had
she
felt
more
at
peace
with
all
men
or
thought
more
kindly
of
the
world
and
as
she
so
sat
she
became
aware
of
an
aged
and
beautiful
gentleman
with
white
hair
drawing
near
along
the
lane
and
advancing
to
meet
him
another
and
very
small
gentleman
to
whom
at
first
she
29
paid
less
attention
when
they
had
come
within
speech
which
was
just
under
the
maid's
eyes
the
older
man
bowed
and
accosted
the
other
with
a
very
pretty
manner
of
politeness
it
did
not
seem
as
if
the
subject
of
his
address
were
of
great
importance
indeed
from
his
pointing
it
sometimes
appeared
as
if
he
were
only
inquiring
his
way
but
the
moon
shone
on
his
face
as
he
spoke
and
the
girl
was
pleased
to
watch
it
it
seemed
to
breathe
such
an
innocent
and
old-world
kindness
of
disposition
yet
with
something
high
too
as
of
a
well-founded
self-content
presently
her
eye
wandered
to
the
other
and
she
was
surprised
to
recognise
in
him
a
certain
mr
hyde
who
had
once
visited
her
master
and
for
whom
she
had
conceived
a
dislike
he
had
in
his
hand
a
heavy
cane
with
which
he
was
trifling
but
he
answered
never
a
word
and
seemed
to
listen
with
an
ill-contained
impatience
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
broke
out
in
a
great
flame
of
anger
stamping
with
his
foot
brandishing
the
cane
and
carrying
on
as
the
maid
described
it
like
a
madman
the
old
gentleman
took
a
step
back
with
the
air
of
one
very
much
surprised
and
a
trifle
hurt
and
at
that
mr
hyde
broke
out
of
all
bounds
and
clubbed
him
to
the
earth
and
next
moment
with
ape-like
fury
he
was
trampling
his
victim
under
foot
and
hailing
down
a
storm
of
blows
under
which
the
bones
were
audibly
shattered
and
the
body
jumped
upon
the
roadway
at
the
horror
of
these
sights
and
sounds
the
maid
fainted
30
it
was
two
o'clock
when
she
came
to
herself
and
called
for
the
police
the
murderer
was
gone
long
ago
but
there
lay
his
victim
in
the
middle
of
the
lane
incredibly
mangled
the
stick
with
which
the
deed
had
been
done
although
it
was
of
some
rare
and
very
tough
and
heavy
wood
had
broken
in
the
middle
under
the
stress
of
this
insensate
cruelty
and
one
splintered
half
had
rolled
in
the
neighbouring
gutter--the
other
without
doubt
had
been
carried
away
by
the
murderer
a
purse
and
a
gold
watch
were
found
upon
the
victim
but
no
cards
or
papers
except
a
sealed
and
stamped
envelope
which
he
had
been
probably
carrying
to
the
post
and
which
bore
the
name
and
address
of
mr
utterson
this
was
brought
to
the
lawyer
the
next
morning
before
he
was
out
of
bed
and
he
had
no
sooner
seen
it
and
been
told
the
circumstances
than
he
shot
out
a
solemn
lip
i
shall
say
nothing
till
i
have
seen
the
body
said
he
this
may
be
very
serious
have
the
kindness
to
wait
while
i
dress
and
with
the
same
grave
countenance
he
hurried
through
his
breakfast
and
drove
to
the
police
station
whither
the
body
had
been
carried
as
soon
as
he
came
into
the
cell
he
nodded
yes
said
he
i
recognise
him
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
this
is
sir
danvers
carew
good
god
sir
exclaimed
the
officer
is
it
possible
and
the
next
moment
his
eye
31
lighted
up
with
professional
ambition
this
will
make
a
deal
of
noise
he
said
and
perhaps
you
can
help
us
to
the
man
and
he
briefly
narrated
what
the
maid
had
seen
and
showed
the
broken
stick
mr
utterson
had
already
quailed
at
the
name
of
hyde
but
when
the
stick
was
laid
before
him
he
could
doubt
no
longer
broken
and
battered
as
it
was
he
recognised
it
for
one
that
he
had
himself
presented
many
years
before
to
henry
jekyll
is
this
mr
hyde
a
person
of
small
stature
he
inquired
particularly
small
and
particularly
wicked-looking
is
what
the
maid
calls
him
said
the
officer
mr
utterson
reflected
and
then
raising
his
head
if
you
will
come
with
me
in
my
cab
he
said
i
think
i
can
take
you
to
his
house
it
was
by
this
time
about
nine
in
the
morning
and
the
first
fog
of
the
season
a
great
chocolate-coloured
pall
lowered
over
heaven
but
the
wind
was
continually
charging
and
routing
these
embattled
vapours
so
that
as
the
cab
crawled
from
street
to
street
mr
utterson
beheld
a
marvellous
number
of
degrees
and
hues
of
twilight
for
here
it
would
be
dark
like
the
back-end
of
evening
and
there
would
be
a
glow
of
a
rich
lurid
brown
like
the
light
of
some
strange
conflagration
and
here
for
a
moment
the
fog
would
be
quite
broken
up
and
a
haggard
shaft
32
of
daylight
would
glance
in
between
the
swirling
wreaths
the
dismal
quarter
of
soho
seen
under
these
changing
glimpses
with
its
muddy
ways
and
slatternly
passengers
and
its
lamps
which
had
never
been
extinguished
or
had
been
kindled
afresh
to
combat
this
mournful
re-invasion
of
darkness
seemed
in
the
lawyer's
eyes
like
a
district
of
some
city
in
a
nightmare
the
thoughts
of
his
mind
besides
were
of
the
gloomiest
dye
and
when
he
glanced
at
the
companion
of
his
drive
he
was
conscious
of
some
touch
of
that
terror
of
the
law
and
the
law's
officers
which
may
at
times
assail
the
most
honest
as
the
cab
drew
up
before
the
address
indicated
the
fog
lifted
a
little
and
showed
him
a
dingy
street
a
gin
palace
a
low
french
eating-house
a
shop
for
the
retail
of
penny
numbers
and
twopenny
salads
many
ragged
children
huddled
in
the
doorways
and
many
women
of
different
nationalities
passing
out
key
in
hand
to
have
a
morning
glass
and
the
next
moment
the
fog
settled
down
again
upon
that
part
as
brown
as
umber
and
cut
him
off
from
his
blackguardly
surroundings
this
was
the
home
of
henry
jekyll's
favourite
of
a
man
who
was
heir
to
a
quarter
of
a
million
sterling
an
ivory-faced
and
silvery-haired
old
woman
opened
the
door
she
had
an
evil
face
smoothed
by
hypocrisy
but
her
manners
were
excellent
yes
she
said
this
was
mr
hyde's
but
he
was
not
at
home
he
had
been
in
that
night
very
late
33
but
had
gone
away
again
in
less
than
an
hour
there
was
nothing
strange
in
that
his
habits
were
very
irregular
and
he
was
often
absent
for
instance
it
was
nearly
two
months
since
she
had
seen
him
till
yesterday
very
well
then
we
wish
to
see
his
rooms
said
the
lawyer
and
when
the
woman
began
to
declare
it
was
impossible
i
had
better
tell
you
who
this
person
is
he
added
this
is
inspector
newcomen
of
scotland
yard
a
flash
of
odious
joy
appeared
upon
the
woman's
face
ah
said
she
he
is
in
trouble
what
has
he
done
mr
utterson
and
the
inspector
exchanged
glances
he
don't
seem
a
very
popular
character
observed
the
latter
and
now
my
good
woman
just
let
me
and
this
gentleman
have
a
look
about
us
in
the
whole
extent
of
the
house
which
but
for
the
old
woman
remained
otherwise
empty
mr
hyde
had
only
used
a
couple
of
rooms
but
these
were
furnished
with
luxury
and
good
taste
a
closet
was
filled
with
wine
the
plate
was
of
silver
the
napery
elegant
a
good
picture
hung
upon
the
walls
a
gift
as
utterson
supposed
from
henry
jekyll
who
was
much
of
a
connoisseur
and
the
carpets
were
of
many
plies
and
agreeable
in
colour
at
this
moment
however
the
rooms
bore
every
mark
of
having
been
recently
and
hurriedly
ransacked
clothes
lay
about
the
floor
with
their
pockets
inside
out
34
lock-fast
drawers
stood
open
and
on
the
hearth
there
lay
a
pile
of
grey
ashes
as
though
many
papers
had
been
burned
from
these
embers
the
inspector
disinterred
the
butt-end
of
a
green
cheque-book
which
had
resisted
the
action
of
the
fire
the
other
half
of
the
stick
was
found
behind
the
door
and
as
this
clinched
his
suspicions
the
officer
declared
himself
delighted
a
visit
to
the
bank
where
several
thousand
pounds
were
found
to
be
lying
to
the
murderer's
credit
completed
his
gratification
you
may
depend
upon
it
sir
he
told
mr
utterson
i
have
him
in
my
hand
he
must
have
lost
his
head
or
he
never
would
have
left
the
stick
or
above
all
burned
the
cheque-book
why
money's
life
to
the
man
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
wait
for
him
at
the
bank
and
get
out
the
handbills
this
last
however
was
not
so
easy
of
accomplishment
for
mr
hyde
had
numbered
few
familiars--even
the
master
of
the
servant-maid
had
only
seen
him
twice
his
family
could
nowhere
be
traced
he
had
never
been
photographed
and
the
few
who
could
describe
him
differed
widely
as
common
observers
will
only
on
one
point
were
they
agreed
and
that
was
the
haunting
sense
of
unexpressed
deformity
with
which
the
fugitive
impressed
his
beholders
35
incident
of
the
letter
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
mr
utterson
found
his
way
to
dr
jekyll's
door
where
he
was
at
once
admitted
by
poole
and
carried
down
by
the
kitchen
offices
and
across
a
yard
which
had
once
been
a
garden
to
the
building
which
was
indifferently
known
as
the
laboratory
or
the
dissecting-rooms
the
doctor
had
bought
the
house
from
the
heirs
of
a
celebrated
surgeon
and
his
own
tastes
being
rather
chemical
than
anatomical
had
changed
the
destination
of
the
block
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
lawyer
had
been
received
in
that
part
of
his
friend's
quarters
and
he
eyed
the
dingy
windowless
structure
with
curiosity
and
gazed
round
with
a
distasteful
sense
of
strangeness
as
he
crossed
the
theatre
once
crowded
with
eager
students
and
now
lying
gaunt
and
silent
the
tables
laden
with
chemical
apparatus
the
floor
strewn
with
crates
and
littered
with
packing
straw
and
the
light
falling
dimly
through
the
foggy
cupola
at
the
further
end
a
flight
of
stairs
mounted
to
a
door
covered
with
red
baize
36
and
through
this
mr
utterson
was
at
last
received
into
the
doctor's
cabinet
it
was
a
large
room
fitted
round
with
glass
presses
furnished
among
other
things
with
a
cheval-glass
and
a
business
table
and
looking
out
upon
the
court
by
three
dusty
windows
barred
with
iron
a
fire
burned
in
the
grate
a
lamp
was
set
lighted
on
the
chimney
shelf
for
even
in
the
houses
the
fog
began
to
lie
thickly
and
there
close
up
to
the
warmth
sat
dr
jekyll
looking
deadly
sick
he
did
not
rise
to
meet
his
visitor
but
held
out
a
cold
hand
and
bade
him
welcome
in
a
changed
voice
and
now
said
mr
utterson
as
soon
as
poole
had
left
them
you
have
heard
the
news
the
doctor
shuddered
they
were
crying
it
in
the
square
he
said
i
heard
them
in
my
dining-room
one
word
said
the
lawyer
carew
was
my
client
but
so
are
you
and
i
want
to
know
what
i
am
doing
you
have
not
been
mad
enough
to
hide
this
fellow
utterson
i
swear
to
god
cried
the
doctor
i
swear
to
god
i
will
never
set
eyes
on
him
again
i
bind
my
honour
to
you
that
i
am
done
with
him
in
this
world
it
is
all
at
an
end
and
indeed
he
does
not
want
my
help
you
do
not
know
him
as
i
do
he
is
safe
he
is
quite
safe
mark
my
words
he
will
never
more
be
heard
of
the
lawyer
listened
gloomily
he
did
not
like
his
friend's
feverish
manner
you
seem
pretty
37
sure
of
him
said
he
and
for
your
sake
i
hope
you
may
be
right
if
it
came
to
a
trial
your
name
might
appear
i
am
quite
sure
of
him
replied
jekyll
i
have
grounds
for
certainty
that
i
cannot
share
with
any
one
but
there
is
one
thing
on
which
you
may
advise
me
i
have--i
have
received
a
letter
and
i
am
at
a
loss
whether
i
should
show
it
to
the
police
i
should
like
to
leave
it
in
your
hands
utterson
you
would
judge
wisely
i
am
sure
i
have
so
great
a
trust
in
you
you
fear
i
suppose
that
it
might
lead
to
his
detection
asked
the
lawyer
no
said
the
other
i
cannot
say
that
i
care
what
becomes
of
hyde
i
am
quite
done
with
him
i
was
thinking
of
my
own
character
which
this
hateful
business
has
rather
exposed
utterson
ruminated
a
while
he
was
surprised
at
his
friend's
selfishness
and
yet
relieved
by
it
well
said
he
at
last
let
me
see
the
letter
the
letter
was
written
in
an
odd
upright
hand
and
signed
edward
hyde
and
it
signified
briefly
enough
that
the
writer's
benefactor
dr
jekyll
whom
he
had
long
so
unworthily
repaid
for
a
thousand
generosities
need
labour
under
no
alarm
for
his
safety
as
he
had
means
of
escape
on
which
he
placed
a
sure
dependence
the
lawyer
liked
this
letter
well
enough
it
put
a
better
colour
on
the
intimacy
than
he
had
looked
for
and
he
blamed
himself
for
some
of
his
past
suspicions
38
have
you
the
envelope
he
asked
i
burned
it
replied
jekyll
before
i
thought
what
i
was
about
but
it
bore
no
postmark
the
note
was
handed
in
shall
i
keep
this
and
sleep
upon
it
asked
utterson
i
wish
you
to
judge
for
me
entirely
was
the
reply
i
have
lost
confidence
in
myself
well
i
shall
consider
returned
the
lawyer
and
now
one
word
more
it
was
hyde
who
dictated
the
terms
in
your
will
about
that
disappearance
the
doctor
seemed
seized
with
a
qualm
of
faintness
he
shut
his
mouth
tight
and
nodded
i
knew
it
said
utterson
he
meant
to
murder
you
you
have
had
a
fine
escape
i
have
had
what
is
far
more
to
the
purpose
returned
the
doctor
solemnly
i
have
had
a
lesson--o
god
utterson
what
a
lesson
i
have
had
and
he
covered
his
face
for
a
moment
with
his
hands
on
his
way
out
the
lawyer
stopped
and
had
a
word
or
two
with
poole
by
the
by
said
he
there
was
a
letter
handed
in
to-day
what
was
the
messenger
like
but
poole
was
positive
nothing
had
come
except
by
post
and
only
circulars
by
that
he
added
this
news
sent
off
the
visitor
with
his
fears
renewed
plainly
the
letter
had
come
by
the
laboratory
door
possibly
indeed
it
had
been
39
written
in
the
cabinet
and
if
that
were
so
it
must
be
differently
judged
and
handled
with
the
more
caution
the
newsboys
as
he
went
were
crying
themselves
hoarse
along
the
footways
special
edition
shocking
murder
of
an
m
p
that
was
the
funeral
oration
of
one
friend
and
client
and
he
could
not
help
a
certain
apprehension
lest
the
good
name
of
another
should
be
sucked
down
in
the
eddy
of
the
scandal
it
was
at
least
a
ticklish
decision
that
he
had
to
make
and
self-reliant
as
he
was
by
habit
he
began
to
cherish
a
longing
for
advice
it
was
not
to
be
had
directly
but
perhaps
he
thought
it
might
be
fished
for
presently
after
he
sat
on
one
side
of
his
own
hearth
with
mr
guest
his
head
clerk
upon
the
other
and
midway
between
at
a
nicely
calculated
distance
from
the
fire
a
bottle
of
a
particular
old
wine
that
had
long
dwelt
unsunned
in
the
foundations
of
his
house
the
fog
still
slept
on
the
wing
above
the
drowned
city
where
the
lamps
glimmered
like
carbuncles
and
through
the
muffle
and
smother
of
these
fallen
clouds
the
procession
of
the
town's
life
was
still
rolling
in
through
the
great
arteries
with
a
sound
as
of
a
mighty
wind
but
the
room
was
gay
with
firelight
in
the
bottle
the
acids
were
long
ago
resolved
the
imperial
dye
had
softened
with
time
as
the
colour
grows
richer
in
stained
windows
and
the
glow
of
hot
autumn
afternoons
on
hillside
vineyards
was
ready
to
be
set
free
40
and
to
disperse
the
fogs
of
london
insensibly
the
lawyer
melted
there
was
no
man
from
whom
he
kept
fewer
secrets
than
mr
guest
and
he
was
not
always
sure
that
he
kept
as
many
as
he
meant
guest
had
often
been
on
business
to
the
doctor's
he
knew
poole
he
could
scarce
have
failed
to
hear
of
mr
hyde's
familiarity
about
the
house
he
might
draw
conclusions
was
it
not
as
well
then
that
he
should
see
a
letter
which
put
that
mystery
to
rights
and
above
all
since
guest
being
a
great
student
and
critic
of
handwriting
would
consider
the
step
natural
and
obliging
the
clerk
besides
was
a
man
of
counsel
he
would
scarce
read
so
strange
a
document
without
dropping
a
remark
and
by
that
remark
mr
utterson
might
shape
his
future
course
this
is
a
sad
business
about
sir
danvers
he
said
yes
sir
indeed
it
has
elicited
a
great
deal
of
public
feeling
returned
guest
the
man
of
course
was
mad
i
should
like
to
hear
your
views
on
that
replied
utterson
i
have
a
document
here
in
his
handwriting
it
is
between
ourselves
for
i
scarce
know
what
to
do
about
it
it
is
an
ugly
business
at
the
best
but
there
it
is
quite
in
your
way
a
murderer's
autograph
guest's
eyes
brightened
and
he
sat
down
at
once
and
studied
it
with
passion
no
sir
he
said
not
mad
but
it
is
an
odd
hand
41
and
by
all
accounts
a
very
odd
writer
added
the
lawyer
just
then
the
servant
entered
with
a
note
is
that
from
dr
jekyll
sir
inquired
the
clerk
i
thought
i
knew
the
writing
anything
private
mr
utterson
only
an
invitation
to
dinner
why
do
you
want
to
see
it
one
moment
i
thank
you
sir
and
the
clerk
laid
the
two
sheets
of
paper
alongside
and
sedulously
compared
their
contents
thank
you
sir
he
said
at
last
returning
both
it's
a
very
interesting
autograph
there
was
a
pause
during
which
mr
utterson
struggled
with
himself
why
did
you
compare
them
guest
he
inquired
suddenly
well
sir
returned
the
clerk
there's
a
rather
singular
resemblance
the
two
hands
are
in
many
points
identical
only
differently
sloped
rather
quaint
said
utterson
it
is
as
you
say
rather
quaint
returned
guest
i
wouldn't
speak
of
this
note
you
know
said
the
master
no
sir
said
the
clerk
i
understand
but
no
sooner
was
mr
utterson
alone
that
night
than
he
locked
the
note
into
his
safe
where
it
reposed
from
that
time
forward
what
he
thought
henry
jekyll
forge
for
a
murderer
and
his
blood
ran
cold
in
his
veins
42
remarkable
incident
of
dr
lanyon
time
ran
on
thousands
of
pounds
were
offered
in
reward
for
the
death
of
sir
danvers
was
resented
as
a
public
injury
but
mr
hyde
had
disappeared
out
of
the
ken
of
the
police
as
though
he
had
never
existed
much
of
his
past
was
unearthed
indeed
and
all
disreputable
tales
came
out
of
the
man's
cruelty
at
once
so
callous
and
violent
of
his
vile
life
of
his
strange
associates
of
the
hatred
that
seemed
to
have
surrounded
his
career
but
of
his
present
whereabouts
not
a
whisper
from
the
time
he
had
left
the
house
in
soho
on
the
morning
of
the
murder
he
was
simply
blotted
out
and
gradually
as
time
drew
on
mr
utterson
began
to
recover
from
the
hotness
of
his
alarm
and
to
grow
more
at
quiet
with
himself
the
death
of
sir
danvers
was
to
his
way
of
thinking
more
than
paid
for
by
the
disappearance
of
mr
hyde
now
that
that
evil
influence
had
been
withdrawn
a
new
life
began
for
dr
jekyll
he
came
out
of
his
seclusion
renewed
relations
with
his
friends
became
once
more
their
familiar
guest
43
and
entertainer
and
whilst
he
had
always
been
known
for
charities
he
was
now
no
less
distinguished
for
religion
he
was
busy
he
was
much
in
the
open
air
he
did
good
his
face
seemed
to
open
and
brighten
as
if
with
an
inward
consciousness
of
service
and
for
more
than
two
months
the
doctor
was
at
peace
on
the
8th
of
january
utterson
had
dined
at
the
doctor's
with
a
small
party
lanyon
had
been
there
and
the
face
of
the
host
had
looked
from
one
to
the
other
as
in
the
old
days
when
the
trio
were
inseparable
friends
on
the
12th
and
again
on
the
14th
the
door
was
shut
against
the
lawyer
the
doctor
was
confined
to
the
house
poole
said
and
saw
no
one
on
the
15th
he
tried
again
and
was
again
refused
and
having
now
been
used
for
the
last
two
months
to
see
his
friend
almost
daily
he
found
this
return
of
solitude
to
weigh
upon
his
spirits
the
fifth
night
he
had
in
guest
to
dine
with
him
and
the
sixth
he
betook
himself
to
dr
lanyon's
there
at
least
he
was
not
denied
admittance
but
when
he
came
in
he
was
shocked
at
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
the
doctor's
appearance
he
had
his
death-warrant
written
legibly
upon
his
face
the
rosy
man
had
grown
pale
his
flesh
had
fallen
away
he
was
visibly
balder
and
older
and
yet
it
was
not
so
much
these
tokens
of
a
swift
physical
decay
that
arrested
the
lawyer's
notice
as
a
look
in
the
eye
and
quality
of
manner
that
seemed
to
testify
to
44
some
deep-seated
terror
of
the
mind
it
was
unlikely
that
the
doctor
should
fear
death
and
yet
that
was
what
utterson
was
tempted
to
suspect
yes
he
thought
he
is
a
doctor
he
must
know
his
own
state
and
that
his
days
are
counted
and
the
knowledge
is
more
than
he
can
bear
and
yet
when
utterson
remarked
on
his
ill-looks
it
was
with
an
air
of
greatness
that
lanyon
declared
himself
a
doomed
man
i
have
had
a
shock
he
said
and
i
shall
never
recover
it
is
a
question
of
weeks
well
life
has
been
pleasant
i
liked
it
yes
sir
i
used
to
like
it
i
sometimes
think
if
we
knew
all
we
should
be
more
glad
to
get
away
jekyll
is
ill
too
observed
utterson
have
you
seen
him
but
lanyon's
face
changed
and
he
held
up
a
trembling
hand
i
wish
to
see
or
hear
no
more
of
dr
jekyll
he
said
in
a
loud
unsteady
voice
i
am
quite
done
with
that
person
and
i
beg
that
you
will
spare
me
any
allusion
to
one
whom
i
regard
as
dead
tut-tut
said
mr
utterson
and
then
after
a
considerable
pause
can't
i
do
anything
he
inquired
we
are
three
very
old
friends
lanyon
we
shall
not
live
to
make
others
nothing
can
be
done
returned
lanyon
ask
himself
he
will
not
see
me
said
the
lawyer
i
am
not
surprised
at
that
was
the
reply
some
day
utterson
after
i
am
dead
you
may
45
perhaps
come
to
learn
the
right
and
wrong
of
this
i
cannot
tell
you
and
in
the
meantime
if
you
can
sit
and
talk
with
me
of
other
things
for
god's
sake
stay
and
do
so
but
if
you
cannot
keep
clear
of
this
accursed
topic
then
in
god's
name
go
for
i
cannot
bear
it
as
soon
as
he
got
home
utterson
sat
down
and
wrote
to
jekyll
complaining
of
his
exclusion
from
the
house
and
asking
the
cause
of
this
unhappy
break
with
lanyon
and
the
next
day
brought
him
a
long
answer
often
very
pathetically
worded
and
sometimes
darkly
mysterious
in
drift
the
quarrel
with
lanyon
was
incurable
i
do
not
blame
our
old
friend
jekyll
wrote
but
i
share
his
view
that
we
must
never
meet
i
mean
from
henceforth
to
lead
a
life
of
extreme
seclusion
you
must
not
be
surprised
nor
must
you
doubt
my
friendship
if
my
door
is
often
shut
even
to
you
you
must
suffer
me
to
go
my
own
dark
way
i
have
brought
on
myself
a
punishment
and
a
danger
that
i
cannot
name
if
i
am
the
chief
of
sinners
i
am
the
chief
of
sufferers
also
i
could
not
think
that
this
earth
contained
a
place
for
sufferings
and
terrors
so
unmanning
and
you
can
do
but
one
thing
utterson
to
lighten
this
destiny
and
that
is
to
respect
my
silence
utterson
was
amazed
the
dark
influence
of
hyde
had
been
withdrawn
the
doctor
had
returned
to
his
old
tasks
and
amities
a
week
ago
the
prospect
had
smiled
with
every
promise
of
a
cheerful
and
an
honoured
age
46
and
now
in
a
moment
friendship
and
peace
of
mind
and
the
whole
tenor
of
his
life
were
wrecked
so
great
and
unprepared
a
change
pointed
to
madness
but
in
view
of
lanyon's
manner
and
words
there
must
lie
for
it
some
deeper
ground
a
week
afterwards
dr
lanyon
took
to
his
bed
and
in
something
less
than
a
fortnight
he
was
dead
the
night
after
the
funeral
at
which
he
had
been
sadly
affected
utterson
locked
the
door
of
his
business
room
and
sitting
there
by
the
light
of
a
melancholy
candle
drew
out
and
set
before
him
an
envelope
addressed
by
the
hand
and
sealed
with
the
seal
of
his
dead
friend
private
for
the
hands
of
g
j
utterson
alone
and
in
case
of
his
predecease
to
be
destroyed
unread
so
it
was
emphatically
superscribed
and
the
lawyer
dreaded
to
behold
the
contents
i
have
buried
one
friend
to-day
he
thought
what
if
this
should
cost
me
another
and
then
he
condemned
the
fear
as
a
disloyalty
and
broke
the
seal
within
there
was
another
enclosure
likewise
sealed
and
marked
upon
the
cover
as
not
to
be
opened
till
the
death
or
disappearance
of
dr
henry
jekyll
utterson
could
not
trust
his
eyes
yes
it
was
disappearance
here
again
as
in
the
mad
will
which
he
had
long
ago
restored
to
its
author
here
again
were
the
idea
of
a
disappearance
and
the
name
of
henry
jekyll
bracketed
but
in
the
will
that
idea
had
sprung
from
the
sinister
suggestion
of
47
the
man
hyde
it
was
set
there
with
a
purpose
all
too
plain
and
horrible
written
by
the
hand
of
lanyon
what
should
it
mean
a
great
curiosity
came
on
the
trustee
to
disregard
the
prohibition
and
dive
at
once
to
the
bottom
of
these
mysteries
but
professional
honour
and
faith
to
his
dead
friend
were
stringent
obligations
and
the
packet
slept
in
the
inmost
corner
of
his
private
safe
it
is
one
thing
to
mortify
curiosity
another
to
conquer
it
and
it
may
be
doubted
if
from
that
day
forth
utterson
desired
the
society
of
his
surviving
friend
with
the
same
eagerness
he
thought
of
him
kindly
but
his
thoughts
were
disquieted
and
fearful
he
went
to
call
indeed
but
he
was
perhaps
relieved
to
be
denied
admittance
perhaps
in
his
heart
he
preferred
to
speak
with
poole
upon
the
doorstep
and
surrounded
by
the
air
and
sounds
of
the
open
city
rather
than
to
be
admitted
into
that
house
of
voluntary
bondage
and
to
sit
and
speak
with
its
inscrutable
recluse
poole
had
indeed
no
very
pleasant
news
to
communicate
the
doctor
it
appeared
now
more
than
ever
confined
himself
to
the
cabinet
over
the
laboratory
where
he
would
sometimes
even
sleep
he
was
out
of
spirits
he
had
grown
very
silent
he
did
not
read
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
mind
utterson
became
so
used
to
the
unvarying
character
of
these
reports
that
he
fell
off
little
by
little
in
the
frequency
of
his
visits
48
incident
at
the
window
it
chanced
on
sunday
when
mr
utterson
was
on
his
usual
walk
with
mr
enfield
that
their
way
lay
once
again
through
the
by-street
and
that
when
they
came
in
front
of
the
door
both
stopped
to
gaze
on
it
well
said
enfield
that
story's
at
an
end
at
least
we
shall
never
see
more
of
mr
hyde
i
hope
not
said
utterson
did
i
ever
tell
you
that
i
once
saw
him
and
shared
your
feeling
of
repulsion
it
was
impossible
to
do
the
one
without
the
other
returned
enfield
and
by
the
way
what
an
ass
you
must
have
thought
me
not
to
know
that
this
was
a
back
way
to
dr
jekyll's
it
was
partly
your
own
fault
that
i
found
it
out
even
when
i
did
so
you
found
it
out
did
you
said
utterson
but
if
that
be
so
we
may
step
into
the
court
and
take
a
look
at
the
windows
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
uneasy
about
poor
jekyll
and
even
outside
i
feel
as
if
the
presence
of
a
friend
might
do
him
good
49
the
court
was
very
cool
and
a
little
damp
and
full
of
premature
twilight
although
the
sky
high
up
overhead
was
still
bright
with
sunset
the
middle
one
of
the
three
windows
was
half-way
open
and
sitting
close
beside
it
taking
the
air
with
an
infinite
sadness
of
mien
like
some
disconsolate
prisoner
utterson
saw
dr
jekyll
what
jekyll
he
cried
i
trust
you
are
better
i
am
very
low
utterson
replied
the
doctor
drearily
very
low
it
will
not
last
long
thank
god
you
stay
too
much
indoors
said
the
lawyer
you
should
be
out
whipping
up
the
circulation
like
mr
enfield
and
me
this
is
my
cousin--mr
enfield--dr
jekyll
come
now
get
your
hat
and
take
a
quick
turn
with
us
you
are
very
good
sighed
the
other
i
should
like
to
very
much
but
no
no
no
it
is
quite
impossible
i
dare
not
but
indeed
utterson
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
this
is
really
a
great
pleasure
i
would
ask
you
and
mr
enfield
up
but
the
place
is
really
not
fit
why
then
said
the
lawyer
good-naturedly
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
stay
down
here
and
speak
with
you
from
where
we
are
that
is
just
what
i
was
about
to
venture
to
propose
returned
the
doctor
with
a
smile
but
the
words
were
hardly
uttered
before
the
smile
was
struck
out
of
his
face
and
succeeded
50
by
an
expression
of
such
abject
terror
and
despair
as
froze
the
very
blood
of
the
two
gentlemen
below
they
saw
it
but
for
a
glimpse
for
the
window
was
instantly
thrust
down
but
that
glimpse
had
been
sufficient
and
they
turned
and
left
the
court
without
a
word
in
silence
too
they
traversed
the
by-street
and
it
was
not
until
they
had
come
into
a
neighbouring
thoroughfare
where
even
upon
a
sunday
there
were
still
some
stirrings
of
life
that
mr
utterson
at
last
turned
and
looked
at
his
companion
they
were
both
pale
and
there
was
an
answering
horror
in
their
eyes
god
forgive
us
god
forgive
us
said
mr
utterson
but
mr
enfield
only
nodded
his
head
very
seriously
and
walked
on
once
more
in
silence
51
the
last
night
mr
utterson
was
sitting
by
his
fireside
one
evening
after
dinner
when
he
was
surprised
to
receive
a
visit
from
poole
bless
me
poole
what
brings
you
here
he
cried
and
then
taking
a
second
look
at
him
what
ails
you
he
added
is
the
doctor
ill
mr
utterson
said
the
man
there
is
something
wrong
take
a
seat
and
here
is
a
glass
of
wine
for
you
said
the
lawyer
now
take
your
time
and
tell
me
plainly
what
you
want
you
know
the
doctor's
ways
sir
replied
poole
and
how
he
shuts
himself
up
well
he's
shut
up
again
in
the
cabinet
and
i
don't
like
it
sir--i
wish
i
may
die
if
i
like
it
mr
utterson
sir
i'm
afraid
now
my
good
man
said
the
lawyer
be
explicit
what
are
you
afraid
of
i've
been
afraid
for
about
a
week
returned
poole
doggedly
disregarding
the
question
and
i
can
bear
it
no
more
the
man's
appearance
amply
bore
out
his
52
words
his
manner
was
altered
for
the
worse
and
except
for
the
moment
when
he
had
first
announced
his
terror
he
had
not
once
looked
the
lawyer
in
the
face
even
now
he
sat
with
the
glass
of
wine
untasted
on
his
knee
and
his
eyes
directed
to
a
corner
of
the
floor
i
can
bear
it
no
more
he
repeated
come
said
the
lawyer
i
see
you
have
some
good
reason
poole
i
see
there
is
something
seriously
amiss
try
to
tell
me
what
it
is
i
think
there's
been
foul
play
said
poole
hoarsely
foul
play
cried
the
lawyer
a
good
deal
frightened
and
rather
inclined
to
be
irritated
in
consequence
what
foul
play
what
does
the
man
mean
i
daren't
say
sir
was
the
answer
but
will
you
come
along
with
me
and
see
for
yourself
mr
utterson's
only
answer
was
to
rise
and
get
his
hat
and
great-coat
but
he
observed
with
wonder
the
greatness
of
the
relief
that
appeared
upon
the
butler's
face
and
perhaps
with
no
less
that
the
wine
was
still
untasted
when
he
set
it
down
to
follow
it
was
a
wild
cold
seasonable
night
of
march
with
a
pale
moon
lying
on
her
back
as
though
the
wind
had
tilted
her
and
a
flying
wrack
of
the
most
diaphanous
and
lawny
texture
the
wind
made
talking
difficult
and
flecked
the
blood
into
the
face
it
seemed
to
have
swept
the
53
streets
unusually
bare
of
passengers
besides
for
mr
utterson
thought
he
had
never
seen
that
part
of
london
so
deserted
he
could
have
wished
it
otherwise
never
in
his
life
had
he
been
conscious
of
so
sharp
a
wish
to
see
and
touch
his
fellow-creatures
for
struggle
as
he
might
there
was
borne
in
upon
his
mind
a
crushing
anticipation
of
calamity
the
square
when
they
got
there
was
all
full
of
wind
and
dust
and
the
thin
trees
in
the
garden
were
lashing
themselves
along
the
railing
poole
who
had
kept
all
the
way
a
pace
or
two
ahead
now
pulled
up
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement
and
in
spite
of
the
biting
weather
took
off
his
hat
and
mopped
his
brow
with
a
red
pocket-handkerchief
but
for
all
the
hurry
of
his
coming
these
were
not
the
dews
of
exertion
that
he
wiped
away
but
the
moisture
of
some
strangling
anguish
for
his
face
was
white
and
his
voice
when
he
spoke
harsh
and
broken
well
sir
he
said
here
we
are
and
god
grant
there
be
nothing
wrong
amen
poole
said
the
lawyer
thereupon
the
servant
knocked
in
a
very
guarded
manner
the
door
was
opened
on
the
chain
and
a
voice
asked
from
within
is
that
you
poole
it's
all
right
said
poole
open
the
door
the
hall
when
they
entered
it
was
brightly
lighted
up
the
fire
was
built
high
and
about
the
hearth
the
whole
of
the
servants
men
and
54
women
stood
huddled
together
like
a
flock
of
sheep
at
the
sight
of
mr
utterson
the
housemaid
broke
into
hysterical
whimpering
and
the
cook
crying
out
bless
god
it's
mr
utterson
ran
forward
as
if
to
take
him
in
her
arms
what
what
are
you
all
here
said
the
lawyer
peevishly
very
irregular
very
unseemly
your
master
would
be
far
from
pleased
they're
all
afraid
said
poole
blank
silence
followed
no
one
protesting
only
the
maid
lifted
up
her
voice
and
now
wept
loudly
hold
your
tongue
poole
said
to
her
with
a
ferocity
of
accent
that
testified
to
his
own
jangled
nerves
and
indeed
when
the
girl
had
so
suddenly
raised
the
note
of
her
lamentation
they
had
all
started
and
turned
toward
the
inner
door
with
faces
of
dreadful
expectation
and
now
continued
the
butler
addressing
the
knife-boy
reach
me
a
candle
and
we'll
get
this
through
hands
at
once
and
then
he
begged
mr
utterson
to
follow
him
and
led
the
way
to
the
back-garden
now
sir
said
he
you
come
as
gently
as
you
can
i
want
you
to
hear
and
i
don't
want
you
to
be
heard
and
see
here
sir
if
by
any
chance
he
was
to
ask
you
in
don't
go
mr
utterson's
nerves
at
this
unlooked-for
termination
gave
a
jerk
that
nearly
threw
him
from
his
balance
but
he
re-collected
his
courage
55
and
followed
the
butler
into
the
laboratory
building
and
through
the
surgical
theatre
with
its
lumber
of
crates
and
bottles
to
the
foot
of
the
stair
here
poole
motioned
him
to
stand
on
one
side
and
listen
while
he
himself
setting
down
the
candle
and
making
a
great
and
obvious
call
on
his
resolution
mounted
the
steps
and
knocked
with
a
somewhat
uncertain
hand
on
the
red
baize
of
the
cabinet
door
mr
utterson
sir
asking
to
see
you
he
called
and
even
as
he
did
so
once
more
violently
signed
to
the
lawyer
to
give
ear
a
voice
answered
from
within
tell
him
i
cannot
see
any
one
it
said
complainingly
thank
you
sir
said
poole
with
a
note
of
something
like
triumph
in
his
voice
and
taking
up
his
candle
he
led
mr
utterson
back
across
the
yard
and
into
the
great
kitchen
where
the
fire
was
out
and
the
beetles
were
leaping
on
the
floor
sir
he
said
looking
mr
utterson
in
the
eyes
was
that
my
master's
voice
it
seems
much
changed
replied
the
lawyer
very
pale
but
giving
look
for
look
changed
well
yes
i
think
so
said
the
butler
have
i
been
twenty
years
in
this
man's
house
to
be
deceived
about
his
voice
no
sir
master's
made
away
with
he
was
made
away
with
eight
days
ago
when
we
heard
him
cry
out
upon
the
name
of
god
and
who's
in
there
instead
of
him
and
why
it
stays
there
is
a
thing
that
cries
to
heaven
mr
utterson
56
this
is
a
very
strange
tale
poole
this
is
rather
a
wild
tale
my
man
said
mr
utterson
biting
his
finger
suppose
it
were
as
you
suppose
supposing
dr
jekyll
to
have
been--well
murdered
what
could
induce
the
murderer
to
stay
that
won't
hold
water
it
doesn't
commend
itself
to
reason
well
mr
utterson
you
are
a
hard
man
to
satisfy
but
i'll
do
it
yet
said
poole
all
this
last
week
you
must
know
him
or
it
or
whatever
it
is
that
lives
in
that
cabinet
has
been
crying
night
and
day
for
some
sort
of
medicine
and
cannot
get
it
to
his
mind
it
was
sometimes
his
way--the
master's
that
is--to
write
his
orders
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
throw
it
on
the
stair
we've
had
nothing
else
this
week
back
nothing
but
papers
and
a
closed
door
and
the
very
meals
left
there
to
be
smuggled
in
when
nobody
was
looking
well
sir
every
day
ay
and
twice
and
thrice
in
the
same
day
there
have
been
orders
and
complaints
and
i
have
been
sent
flying
to
all
the
wholesale
chemists
in
town
every
time
i
brought
the
stuff
back
there
would
be
another
paper
telling
me
to
return
it
because
it
was
not
pure
and
another
order
to
a
different
firm
this
drug
is
wanted
bitter
bad
sir
whatever
for
have
you
any
of
these
papers
asked
mr
utterson
poole
felt
in
his
pocket
and
handed
out
a
crumpled
note
which
the
lawyer
bending
nearer
57
to
the
candle
carefully
examined
its
contents
ran
thus
dr
jekyll
presents
his
compliments
to
messrs
maw
he
assures
them
that
their
last
sample
is
impure
and
quite
useless
for
his
present
purpose
in
the
year
18---
dr
j
purchased
a
somewhat
large
quantity
from
messrs
m
he
now
begs
them
to
search
with
the
most
sedulous
care
and
should
any
of
the
same
quality
be
left
to
forward
it
to
him
at
once
expense
is
no
consideration
the
importance
of
this
to
dr
j
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
so
far
the
letter
had
run
composedly
enough
but
here
with
a
sudden
splutter
of
the
pen
the
writer's
emotion
had
broken
loose
for
god's
sake
he
had
added
find
me
some
of
the
old
this
is
a
strange
note
said
mr
utterson
and
then
sharply
how
do
you
come
to
have
it
open
the
man
at
maw's
was
main
angry
sir
and
he
threw
it
back
to
me
like
so
much
dirt
returned
poole
this
is
unquestionably
the
doctor's
hand
do
you
know
resumed
the
lawyer
i
thought
it
looked
like
it
said
the
servant
rather
sulkily
and
then
with
another
voice
but
what
matters
hand-of-write
he
said
i've
seen
him
seen
him
repeated
mr
utterson
well
that's
it
said
poole
it
was
this
way
i
came
suddenly
into
the
theatre
from
the
58
garden
it
seems
he
had
slipped
out
to
look
for
this
drug
or
whatever
it
is
for
the
cabinet
door
was
open
and
there
he
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
digging
among
the
crates
he
looked
up
when
i
came
in
gave
a
kind
of
cry
and
whipped
up-stairs
into
the
cabinet
it
was
but
for
one
minute
that
i
saw
him
but
the
hair
stood
upon
my
head
like
quills
sir
if
that
was
my
master
why
had
he
a
mask
upon
his
face
if
it
was
my
master
why
did
he
cry
out
like
a
rat
and
run
from
me
i
have
served
him
long
enough
and
then
the
man
paused
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
these
are
all
very
strange
circumstances
said
mr
utterson
but
i
think
i
begin
to
see
daylight
your
master
poole
is
plainly
seized
with
one
of
those
maladies
that
both
torture
and
deform
the
sufferer
hence
for
aught
i
know
the
alteration
of
his
voice
hence
the
mask
and
the
avoidance
of
his
friends
hence
his
eagerness
to
find
this
drug
by
means
of
which
the
poor
soul
retains
some
hope
of
ultimate
recovery--god
grant
that
he
be
not
deceived
there
is
my
explanation
it
is
sad
enough
poole
ay
and
appalling
to
consider
but
it
is
plain
and
natural
hangs
well
together
and
delivers
us
from
all
exorbitant
alarms
sir
said
the
butler
turning
to
a
sort
of
mottled
pallor
that
thing
was
not
my
master
and
there's
the
truth
my
master
here
he
looked
round
him
and
began
to
whisper--is
59
a
tall
fine
build
of
a
man
and
this
was
more
of
a
dwarf
utterson
attempted
to
protest
o
sir
cried
poole
do
you
think
i
do
not
know
my
master
after
twenty
years
do
you
think
i
do
not
know
where
his
head
comes
to
in
the
cabinet
door
where
i
saw
him
every
morning
of
my
life
no
sir
that
thing
in
the
mask
was
never
dr
jekyll--god
knows
what
it
was
but
it
was
never
dr
jekyll
and
it
is
the
belief
of
my
heart
that
there
was
murder
done
poole
replied
the
lawyer
if
you
say
that
it
will
become
my
duty
to
make
certain
much
as
i
desire
to
spare
your
master's
feelings
much
as
i
am
puzzled
by
this
note
which
seems
to
prove
him
to
be
still
alive
i
shall
consider
it
my
duty
to
break
in
that
door
ah
mr
utterson
that's
talking
cried
the
butler
and
now
comes
the
second
question
resumed
utterson
who
is
going
to
do
it
why
you
and
me
was
the
undaunted
reply
that's
very
well
said
returned
the
lawyer
and
whatever
comes
of
it
i
shall
make
it
my
business
to
see
you
are
no
loser
there
is
an
axe
in
the
theatre
continued
poole
and
you
might
take
the
kitchen
poker
for
yourself
the
lawyer
took
that
rude
but
weighty
instrument
into
his
hand
and
balanced
it
do
you
know
poole
he
said
looking
up
that
60
you
and
i
are
about
to
place
ourselves
in
a
position
of
some
peril
you
may
say
so
sir
indeed
returned
the
butler
it
is
well
then
that
we
should
be
frank
said
the
other
we
both
think
more
than
we
have
said
let
us
make
a
clean
breast
this
masked
figure
that
you
saw
did
you
recognise
it
well
sir
it
went
so
quick
and
the
creature
was
so
doubled
up
that
i
could
hardly
swear
to
that
was
the
answer
but
if
you
mean
was
it
mr
hyde--why
yes
i
think
it
was
you
see
it
was
much
of
the
same
bigness
and
it
had
the
same
quick
light
way
with
it
and
then
who
else
could
have
got
in
by
the
laboratory
door
you
have
not
forgot
sir
that
at
the
time
of
the
murder
he
had
still
the
key
with
him
but
that's
not
all
i
don't
know
mr
utterson
if
ever
you
met
this
mr
hyde
yes
said
the
lawyer
i
once
spoke
with
him
then
you
must
know
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
that
there
was
something
queer
about
that
gentleman--something
that
gave
a
man
a
turn--i
don't
know
rightly
how
to
say
it
sir
beyond
this
that
you
felt
it
in
your
marrow
kind
of
cold
and
thin
i
own
i
felt
something
of
what
you
describe
said
mr
utterson
quite
so
sir
returned
poole
well
when
61
that
masked
thing
like
a
monkey
jumped
from
among
the
chemicals
and
whipped
into
the
cabinet
it
went
down
my
spine
like
ice
oh
i
know
it's
not
evidence
mr
utterson
i'm
book-learned
enough
for
that
but
a
man
has
his
feelings
and
i
give
you
my
bible-word
it
was
mr
hyde
ay
ay
said
the
lawyer
my
fears
incline
to
the
same
point
evil
i
fear
founded--evil
was
sure
to
come--of
that
connection
ay
truly
i
believe
you
i
believe
poor
harry
is
killed
and
i
believe
his
murderer
for
what
purpose
god
alone
can
tell
is
still
lurking
in
his
victim's
room
well
let
our
name
be
vengeance
call
bradshaw
the
footman
came
at
the
summons
very
white
and
nervous
pull
yourself
together
bradshaw
said
the
lawyer
this
suspense
i
know
is
telling
upon
all
of
you
but
it
is
now
our
intention
to
make
an
end
of
it
poole
here
and
i
are
going
to
force
our
way
into
the
cabinet
if
all
is
well
my
shoulders
are
broad
enough
to
bear
the
blame
meanwhile
lest
anything
should
really
be
amiss
or
any
malefactor
seek
to
escape
by
the
back
you
and
the
boy
must
go
round
the
corner
with
a
pair
of
good
sticks
and
take
your
post
at
the
laboratory
door
we
give
you
ten
minutes
to
get
to
your
stations
as
bradshaw
left
the
lawyer
looked
at
his
watch
and
now
poole
let
us
get
to
ours
62
he
said
and
taking
the
poker
under
his
arm
led
the
way
into
the
yard
the
scud
had
banked
over
the
moon
and
it
was
now
quite
dark
the
wind
which
only
broke
in
puffs
and
draughts
into
that
deep
well
of
building
tossed
the
light
of
the
candle
to
and
fro
about
their
steps
until
they
came
into
the
shelter
of
the
theatre
where
they
sat
down
silently
to
wait
london
hummed
solemnly
all
around
but
nearer
at
hand
the
stillness
was
only
broken
by
the
sounds
of
a
footfall
moving
to
and
fro
along
the
cabinet
floor
so
it
will
walk
all
day
sir
whispered
poole
ay
and
the
better
part
of
the
night
only
when
a
new
sample
comes
from
the
chemist
there's
a
bit
of
a
break
ah
it's
an
ill
conscience
that's
such
an
enemy
to
rest
ah
sir
there's
blood
foully
shed
in
every
step
of
it
but
hark
again
a
little
closer--put
your
heart
in
your
ears
mr
utterson
and
tell
me
is
that
the
doctor's
foot
the
steps
fell
lightly
and
oddly
with
a
certain
swing
for
all
they
went
so
slowly
it
was
different
indeed
from
the
heavy
creaking
tread
of
henry
jekyll
utterson
sighed
is
there
never
anything
else
he
asked
poole
nodded
once
he
said
once
i
heard
it
weeping
weeping
how
that
said
the
lawyer
conscious
of
a
sudden
chill
of
horror
weeping
like
a
woman
or
a
lost
soul
said
63
the
butler
i
came
away
with
that
upon
my
heart
that
i
could
have
wept
too
but
now
the
ten
minutes
drew
to
an
end
poole
disinterred
the
axe
from
under
a
stack
of
packing
straw
the
candle
was
set
upon
the
nearest
table
to
light
them
to
the
attack
and
they
drew
near
with
bated
breath
to
where
that
patient
foot
was
still
going
up
and
down
up
and
down
in
the
quiet
of
the
night
jekyll
cried
utterson
with
a
loud
voice
i
demand
to
see
you
he
paused
a
moment
but
there
came
no
reply
i
give
you
fair
warning
our
suspicions
are
aroused
and
i
must
and
shall
see
you
he
resumed
if
not
by
fair
means
then
by
foul
if
not
of
your
consent
then
by
brute
force
utterson
said
the
voice
for
god's
sake
have
mercy
ah
that's
not
jekyll's
voice--it's
hyde's
cried
utterson
down
with
the
door
poole
poole
swung
the
axe
over
his
shoulder
the
blow
shook
the
building
and
the
red
baize
door
leaped
against
the
lock
and
hinges
a
dismal
screech
as
of
mere
animal
terror
rang
from
the
cabinet
up
went
the
axe
again
and
again
the
panels
crashed
and
the
frame
bounded
four
times
the
blow
fell
but
the
wood
was
tough
and
the
fittings
were
of
excellent
workmanship
and
it
was
not
until
the
fifth
that
the
lock
burst
in
sunder
and
the
wreck
of
the
door
fell
inwards
on
the
carpet
64
the
besiegers
appalled
by
their
own
riot
and
the
stillness
that
had
succeeded
stood
back
a
little
and
peered
in
there
lay
the
cabinet
before
their
eyes
in
the
quiet
lamplight
a
good
fire
glowing
and
chattering
on
the
hearth
the
kettle
singing
its
thin
strain
a
drawer
or
two
open
papers
neatly
set
forth
on
the
business-table
and
nearer
the
fire
the
things
laid
out
for
tea
the
quietest
room
you
would
have
said
and
but
for
the
glazed
presses
full
of
chemicals
the
most
commonplace
that
night
in
london
right
in
the
midst
there
lay
the
body
of
a
man
sorely
contorted
and
still
twitching
they
drew
near
on
tiptoe
turned
it
on
its
back
and
beheld
the
face
of
edward
hyde
he
was
dressed
in
clothes
far
too
large
for
him
clothes
of
the
doctor's
bigness
the
cords
of
his
face
still
moved
with
a
semblance
of
life
but
life
was
quite
gone
and
by
the
crushed
phial
in
the
hand
and
the
strong
smell
of
kernels
that
hung
upon
the
air
utterson
knew
that
he
was
looking
on
the
body
of
a
self-destroyer
we
have
come
too
late
he
said
sternly
whether
to
save
or
punish
hyde
is
gone
to
his
account
and
it
only
remains
for
us
to
find
the
body
of
your
master
the
far
greater
proportion
of
the
building
was
occupied
by
the
theatre
which
filled
almost
the
whole
ground
story
and
was
lighted
from
above
and
by
the
cabinet
which
formed
an
upper
story
at
one
end
and
looked
upon
the
65
court
a
corridor
joined
the
theatre
to
the
door
on
the
by-street
and
with
this
the
cabinet
communicated
separately
by
a
second
flight
of
stairs
there
were
besides
a
few
dark
closets
and
a
spacious
cellar
all
these
they
now
thoroughly
examined
each
closet
needed
but
a
glance
for
all
were
empty
and
all
by
the
dust
that
fell
from
their
doors
had
stood
long
unopened
the
cellar
indeed
was
filled
with
crazy
lumber
mostly
dating
from
the
times
of
the
surgeon
who
was
jekyll's
predecessor
but
even
as
they
opened
the
door
they
were
advertised
of
the
uselessness
of
further
search
by
the
fall
of
a
perfect
mat
of
cobweb
which
had
for
years
sealed
up
the
entrance
nowhere
was
there
any
trace
of
henry
jekyll
dead
or
alive
poole
stamped
on
the
flags
of
the
corridor
he
must
be
buried
here
he
said
hearkening
to
the
sound
or
he
may
have
fled
said
utterson
and
he
turned
to
examine
the
door
in
the
by-street
it
was
locked
and
lying
near
by
on
the
flags
they
found
the
key
already
stained
with
rust
this
does
not
look
like
use
observed
the
lawyer
use
echoed
poole
do
you
not
see
sir
it
is
broken
much
as
if
a
man
had
stamped
on
it
ay
continued
utterson
and
the
fractures
too
are
rusty
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
with
a
scare
this
is
beyond
me
66
poole
said
the
lawyer
let
us
go
back
to
the
cabinet
they
mounted
the
stair
in
silence
and
still
with
an
occasional
awe-struck
glance
at
the
dead
body
proceeded
more
thoroughly
to
examine
the
contents
of
the
cabinet
at
one
table
there
were
traces
of
chemical
work
various
measured
heaps
of
some
white
salt
being
laid
on
glass
saucers
as
though
for
an
experiment
in
which
the
unhappy
man
had
been
prevented
that
is
the
same
drug
that
i
was
always
bringing
him
said
poole
and
even
as
he
spoke
the
kettle
with
a
startling
noise
boiled
over
this
brought
them
to
the
fireside
where
the
easy-chair
was
drawn
cosily
up
and
the
tea-things
stood
ready
to
the
sitter's
elbow
the
very
sugar
in
the
cup
there
were
several
books
on
a
shelf
one
lay
beside
the
tea-things
open
and
utterson
was
amazed
to
find
it
a
copy
of
a
pious
work
for
which
jekyll
had
several
times
expressed
a
great
esteem
annotated
in
his
own
hand
with
startling
blasphemies
next
in
the
course
of
their
review
of
the
chamber
the
searchers
came
to
the
cheval
glass
into
whose
depths
they
looked
with
an
involuntary
horror
but
it
was
so
turned
as
to
show
them
nothing
but
the
rosy
glow
playing
on
the
roof
the
fire
sparkling
in
a
hundred
repetitions
along
the
glazed
front
of
the
presses
and
their
own
pale
and
fearful
countenances
stooping
to
look
in
67
this
glass
have
seen
some
strange
things
sir
whispered
poole
and
surely
none
stranger
than
itself
echoed
the
lawyer
in
the
same
tones
for
what
did
jekyll--he
caught
himself
up
at
the
word
with
a
start
and
then
conquering
the
weakness--what
could
jekyll
want
with
it
he
said
you
may
say
that
said
poole
next
they
turned
to
the
business-table
on
the
desk
among
the
neat
array
of
papers
a
large
envelope
was
uppermost
and
bore
in
the
doctor's
hand
the
name
of
mr
utterson
the
lawyer
unsealed
it
and
several
enclosures
fell
to
the
floor
the
first
was
a
will
drawn
in
the
same
eccentric
terms
as
the
one
which
he
had
returned
six
months
before
to
serve
as
a
testament
in
case
of
death
and
as
a
deed
of
gift
in
case
of
disappearance
but
in
place
of
the
name
of
edward
hyde
the
lawyer
with
indescribable
amazement
read
the
name
of
gabriel
john
utterson
he
looked
at
poole
and
then
back
at
the
paper
and
last
of
all
at
the
dead
malefactor
stretched
upon
the
carpet
my
head
goes
round
he
said
he
has
been
all
these
days
in
possession
he
had
no
cause
to
like
me
he
must
have
raged
to
see
himself
displaced
and
he
has
not
destroyed
this
document
he
caught
up
the
next
paper
it
was
a
brief
note
in
the
doctor's
hand
and
dated
at
the
top
68
o
poole
the
lawyer
cried
he
was
alive
and
here
this
day
he
cannot
have
been
disposed
of
in
so
short
a
space
he
must
be
still
alive
he
must
have
fled
and
then
why
fled
and
how
and
in
that
case
can
we
venture
to
declare
this
suicide
oh
we
must
be
careful
i
foresee
that
we
may
yet
involve
your
master
in
some
dire
catastrophe
why
don't
you
read
it
sir
asked
poole
because
i
fear
replied
the
lawyer
solemnly
god
grant
i
have
no
cause
for
it
and
with
that
he
brought
the
paper
to
his
eyes
and
read
as
follows
my
dear
utterson--when
this
shall
fall
into
your
hands
i
shall
have
disappeared
under
what
circumstances
i
have
not
the
penetration
to
foresee
but
my
instinct
and
all
the
circumstances
of
my
nameless
situation
tell
me
that
the
end
is
sure
and
must
be
early
go
then
and
first
read
the
narrative
which
lanyon
warned
me
he
was
to
place
in
your
hands
and
if
you
care
to
hear
more
turn
to
the
confession
of
your
unworthy
and
unhappy
friend
henry
jekyll
there
was
a
third
enclosure
asked
utterson
here
sir
said
poole
and
gave
into
his
hands
a
considerable
packet
sealed
in
several
places
69
the
lawyer
put
it
in
his
pocket
i
would
say
nothing
of
this
paper
if
your
master
has
fled
or
is
dead
we
may
at
least
save
his
credit
it
is
now
ten
i
must
go
home
and
read
these
documents
in
quiet
but
i
shall
be
back
before
midnight
when
we
shall
send
for
the
police
they
went
out
locking
the
door
of
the
theatre
behind
them
and
utterson
once
more
leaving
the
servants
gathered
about
the
fire
in
the
hall
trudged
back
to
his
office
to
read
the
two
narratives
in
which
this
mystery
was
now
to
be
explained
70
dr
lanyon's
narrative
on
the
ninth
of
january
now
four
days
ago
i
received
by
the
evening
delivery
a
registered
envelope
addressed
in
the
hand
of
my
colleague
and
old
school-companion
henry
jekyll
i
was
a
good
deal
surprised
by
this
for
we
were
by
no
means
in
the
habit
of
correspondence
i
had
seen
the
man
dined
with
him
indeed
the
night
before
and
i
could
imagine
nothing
in
our
intercourse
that
should
justify
formality
of
registration
the
contents
increased
my
wonder
for
this
is
how
the
letter
ran
10th
december
18---
dear
lanyon
you
are
one
of
my
oldest
friends
and
although
we
may
have
differed
at
times
on
scientific
questions
i
cannot
remember
at
least
on
my
side
any
break
in
our
affection
there
was
never
a
day
when
if
you
had
said
to
me
'jekyll
my
life
my
honour
my
reason
depend
upon
you'
i
would
not
have
sacrificed
my
left
hand
to
help
you
lanyon
my
life
my
honour
my
reason
are
all
at
your
mercy
71
if
you
fail
me
to-night
i
am
lost
you
might
suppose
after
this
preface
that
i
am
going
to
ask
you
for
something
dishonourable
to
grant
judge
for
yourself
i
want
you
to
postpone
all
other
engagements
for
to-night--ay
even
if
you
were
summoned
to
the
bedside
of
an
emperor
to
take
a
cab
unless
your
carriage
should
be
actually
at
the
door
and
with
this
letter
in
your
hand
for
consultation
to
drive
straight
to
my
house
poole
my
butler
has
his
orders
you
will
find
him
waiting
your
arrival
with
a
locksmith
the
door
of
my
cabinet
is
then
to
be
forced
and
you
are
to
go
in
alone
to
open
the
glazed
press
letter
e
on
the
left
hand
breaking
the
lock
if
it
be
shut
and
to
draw
out
with
all
its
contents
as
they
stand
the
fourth
drawer
from
the
top
or
which
is
the
same
thing
the
third
from
the
bottom
in
my
extreme
distress
of
wind
i
have
a
morbid
fear
of
misdirecting
you
but
even
if
i
am
in
error
you
may
know
the
right
drawer
by
its
contents
some
powders
a
phial
and
a
paper
book
this
drawer
i
beg
of
you
to
carry
back
with
you
to
cavendish
square
exactly
as
it
stands
that
is
the
first
part
of
the
service
now
for
the
second
you
should
be
back
if
you
set
out
at
once
on
the
receipt
of
this
long
before
midnight
but
i
will
leave
you
that
amount
of
margin
not
only
in
the
fear
of
one
of
those
obstacles
that
can
neither
be
prevented
nor
fore-
72
seen
but
because
an
hour
when
your
servants
are
in
bed
is
to
be
preferred
for
what
will
then
remain
to
do
at
midnight
then
i
have
to
ask
you
to
be
alone
in
your
consulting-room
to
admit
with
your
own
hand
into
the
house
a
man
who
will
present
himself
in
my
name
and
to
place
in
his
hands
the
drawer
that
you
will
have
brought
with
you
from
my
cabinet
then
you
will
have
played
your
part
and
earned
my
gratitude
completely
five
minutes
afterwards
if
you
insist
upon
an
explanation
you
will
have
understood
that
these
arrangements
are
of
capital
importance
and
that
by
the
neglect
of
one
of
them
fantastic
as
they
must
appear
you
might
have
charged
your
conscience
with
my
death
or
the
shipwreck
of
my
reason
confident
as
i
am
that
you
will
not
trifle
with
this
appeal
my
heart
sinks
and
my
hand
trembles
at
the
bare
thought
of
such
a
possibility
think
of
me
at
this
hour
in
a
strange
place
labouring
under
a
blackness
of
distress
that
no
fancy
can
exaggerate
and
yet
well
aware
that
if
you
will
but
punctually
serve
me
my
troubles
will
roll
away
like
a
story
that
is
told
serve
me
my
dear
lanyon
and
save
your
friend
h
j
p
s
i
had
already
sealed
this
up
when
a
fresh
terror
struck
upon
my
soul
it
is
possible
that
the
postoffice
may
fail
me
and
this
letter
73
not
come
into
your
hands
until
to-morrow
morning
in
that
case
dear
lanyon
do
my
errand
when
it
shall
be
most
convenient
for
you
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
once
more
expect
my
messenger
at
midnight
it
may
then
already
be
too
late
and
if
that
night
passes
without
event
you
will
know
that
you
have
seen
the
last
of
henry
jekyll
upon
the
reading
of
this
letter
i
made
sure
my
colleague
was
insane
but
till
that
was
proved
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
i
felt
bound
to
do
as
he
requested
the
less
i
understood
of
this
farrago
the
less
i
was
in
a
position
to
judge
of
its
importance
and
an
appeal
so
worded
could
not
be
set
aside
without
a
grave
responsibility
i
rose
accordingly
from
table
got
into
a
hansom
and
drove
straight
to
jekyll's
house
the
butler
was
awaiting
my
arrival
he
had
received
by
the
same
post
as
mine
a
registered
letter
of
instruction
and
had
sent
at
once
for
a
locksmith
and
a
carpenter
the
tradesmen
came
while
we
were
yet
speaking
and
we
moved
in
a
body
to
old
dr
denman's
surgical
theatre
from
which
as
you
are
doubtless
aware
jekyll's
private
cabinet
is
most
conveniently
entered
the
door
was
very
strong
the
lock
excellent
the
carpenter
avowed
he
would
have
great
trouble
and
have
to
do
much
damage
if
force
were
to
be
used
and
the
locksmith
was
near
despair
but
this
last
was
a
handy
fellow
74
and
after
two
hours'
work
the
door
stood
open
the
press
marked
e
was
unlocked
and
i
took
out
the
drawer
had
it
filled
up
with
straw
and
tied
in
a
sheet
and
returned
with
it
to
cavendish
square
here
i
proceeded
to
examine
its
contents
the
powders
were
neatly
enough
made
up
but
not
with
the
nicety
of
the
dispensing
chemist
so
that
it
was
plain
they
were
of
jekyll's
private
manufacture
and
when
i
opened
one
of
the
wrappers
i
found
what
seemed
to
me
a
simple
crystalline
salt
of
a
white
colour
the
phial
to
which
i
next
turned
my
attention
might
have
been
about
half-full
of
a
blood-red
liquor
which
was
highly
pungent
to
the
sense
of
smell
and
seemed
to
me
to
contain
phosphorus
and
some
volatile
ether
at
the
other
ingredients
i
could
make
no
guess
the
book
was
an
ordinary
version-book
and
contained
little
but
a
series
of
dates
these
covered
a
period
of
many
years
but
i
observed
that
the
entries
ceased
nearly
a
year
ago
and
quite
abruptly
here
and
there
a
brief
remark
was
appended
to
a
date
usually
no
more
than
a
single
word
double
occurring
perhaps
six
times
in
a
total
of
several
hundred
entries
and
once
very
early
in
the
list
and
followed
by
several
marks
of
exclamation
total
failure
all
this
though
it
whetted
my
curiosity
told
me
little
that
was
definite
here
were
a
phial
of
some
tincture
a
paper
of
some
salt
and
the
record
of
a
series
of
experi-
75
ments
that
had
led
like
too
many
of
jekyll's
investigations
to
no
end
of
practical
usefulness
how
could
the
presence
of
these
articles
in
my
house
affect
either
the
honour
the
sanity
or
the
life
of
my
flighty
colleague
if
his
messenger
could
go
to
one
place
why
could
he
not
go
to
another
and
even
granting
some
impediment
why
was
this
gentleman
to
be
received
by
me
in
secret
the
more
i
reflected
the
more
convinced
i
grew
that
i
was
dealing
with
a
case
of
cerebral
disease
and
though
i
dismissed
my
servants
to
bed
i
loaded
an
old
revolver
that
i
might
be
found
in
some
posture
of
self-defence
twelve
o'clock
had
scarce
rung
out
over
london
ere
the
knocker
sounded
very
gently
on
the
door
i
went
myself
at
the
summons
and
found
a
small
man
crouching
against
the
pillars
of
the
portico
are
you
come
from
dr
jekyll
i
asked
he
told
me
yes
by
a
constrained
gesture
and
when
i
had
bidden
him
enter
he
did
not
obey
me
without
a
searching
backward
glance
into
the
darkness
of
the
square
there
was
a
policeman
not
far
off
advancing
with
his
bull's
eye
open
and
at
the
sight
i
thought
my
visitor
started
and
made
greater
haste
these
particulars
struck
me
i
confess
disagreeably
and
as
i
followed
him
into
the
bright
light
of
the
consulting-room
i
kept
my
hand
ready
on
my
weapon
here
at
last
i
had
a
76
chance
of
clearly
seeing
him
i
had
never
set
eyes
on
him
before
so
much
was
certain
he
was
small
as
i
have
said
i
was
struck
besides
with
the
shocking
expression
of
his
face
with
his
remarkable
combination
of
great
muscular
activity
and
great
apparent
debility
of
constitution
and--last
but
not
least--
with
the
odd
subjective
disturbance
caused
by
his
neighbourhood
this
bore
some
resemblance
to
incipient
rigour
and
was
accompanied
by
a
marked
sinking
of
the
pulse
at
the
time
i
set
it
down
to
some
idiosyncratic
personal
distaste
and
merely
wondered
at
the
acuteness
of
the
symptoms
but
i
have
since
had
reason
to
believe
the
cause
to
lie
much
deeper
in
the
nature
of
man
and
to
turn
on
some
nobler
hinge
than
the
principle
of
hatred
this
person
who
had
thus
from
the
first
moment
of
his
entrance
struck
in
me
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
disgustful
curiosity
was
dressed
in
a
fashion
that
would
have
made
an
ordinary
person
laughable
his
clothes
that
is
to
say
although
they
were
of
rich
and
sober
fabric
were
enormously
too
large
for
him
in
every
measurement--the
trousers
hanging
on
his
legs
and
rolled
up
to
keep
them
from
the
ground
the
waist
of
the
coat
below
his
haunches
and
the
collar
sprawling
wide
upon
his
shoulders
strange
to
relate
this
ludicrous
accoutrement
was
far
from
moving
me
to
laughter
rather
as
there
was
something
abnormal
and
misbe-
77
gotten
in
the
very
essence
of
the
creature
that
now
faced
me--
something
seizing
surprising
and
revolting--this
fresh
disparity
seemed
but
to
fit
in
with
and
to
reinforce
it
so
that
to
my
interest
in
the
man's
nature
and
character
there
was
added
a
curiosity
as
to
his
origin
his
life
his
fortune
and
status
in
the
world
these
observations
though
they
have
taken
so
great
a
space
to
be
set
down
in
were
yet
the
work
of
a
few
seconds
my
visitor
was
indeed
on
fire
with
sombre
excitement
have
you
got
it
he
cried
have
you
got
it
and
so
lively
was
his
impatience
that
he
even
laid
his
hand
upon
my
arm
and
sought
to
shake
me
i
put
him
back
conscious
at
his
touch
of
a
certain
icy
pang
along
my
blood
come
sir
said
i
you
forget
that
i
have
not
yet
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
be
seated
if
you
please
and
i
showed
him
an
example
and
sat
down
myself
in
my
customary
seat
and
with
as
fair
an
imitation
of
my
ordinary
manner
to
a
patient
as
the
lateness
of
the
hour
the
nature
of
my
pre-occupations
and
the
horror
i
had
of
my
visitor
would
suffer
me
to
muster
i
beg
your
pardon
dr
lanyon
he
replied
civilly
enough
what
you
say
is
very
well
founded
and
my
impatience
has
shown
its
heels
to
my
politeness
i
come
here
at
the
instance
of
your
colleague
dr
henry
jekyll
on
a
piece
of
business
of
some
moment
and
i
under-
78
stood
he
paused
and
put
his
hand
to
his
throat
and
i
could
see
in
spite
of
his
collected
manner
that
he
was
wrestling
against
the
approaches
of
the
hysteria--i
understood
a
drawer
but
here
i
took
pity
on
my
visitor's
suspense
and
some
perhaps
on
my
own
growing
curiosity
there
it
is
sir
said
i
pointing
to
the
drawer
where
it
lay
on
the
floor
behind
a
table
and
still
covered
with
the
sheet
he
sprang
to
it
and
then
paused
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
i
could
hear
his
teeth
grate
with
the
convulsive
action
of
his
jaws
and
his
face
was
so
ghastly
to
see
that
i
grew
alarmed
both
for
his
life
and
reason
compose
yourself
said
i
he
turned
a
dreadful
smile
to
me
and
as
if
with
the
decision
of
despair
plucked
away
the
sheet
at
sight
of
the
contents
he
uttered
one
loud
sob
of
such
immense
relief
that
i
sat
petrified
and
the
next
moment
in
a
voice
that
was
already
fairly
well
under
control
have
you
a
graduated
glass
he
asked
i
rose
from
my
place
with
something
of
an
effort
and
gave
him
what
he
asked
he
thanked
me
with
a
smiling
nod
measured
out
a
few
minims
of
the
red
tincture
and
added
one
of
the
powders
the
mixture
which
was
at
first
of
a
reddish
hue
began
in
proportion
as
the
crystals
melted
to
brighten
in
colour
to
effervesce
audibly
and
to
throw
off
small
79
fumes
of
vapour
suddenly
and
at
the
same
moment
the
ebullition
ceased
and
the
compound
changed
to
a
dark
purple
which
faded
again
more
slowly
to
a
watery
green
my
visitor
who
had
watched
these
metamorphoses
with
a
keen
eye
smiled
set
down
the
glass
upon
the
table
and
then
turned
and
looked
upon
me
with
an
air
of
scrutiny
and
now
said
he
to
settle
what
remains
will
you
be
wise
will
you
be
guided
will
you
suffer
me
to
take
this
glass
in
my
hand
and
to
go
forth
from
your
house
without
further
parley
or
has
the
greed
of
curiosity
too
much
command
of
you
think
before
you
answer
for
it
shall
be
done
as
you
decide
as
you
decide
you
shall
be
left
as
you
were
before
and
neither
richer
nor
wiser
unless
the
sense
of
service
rendered
to
a
man
in
mortal
distress
may
be
counted
as
a
kind
of
riches
of
the
soul
or
if
you
shall
so
prefer
to
choose
a
new
province
of
knowledge
and
new
avenues
to
fame
and
power
shall
be
laid
open
to
you
here
in
this
room
upon
the
instant
and
your
sight
shall
be
blasted
by
a
prodigy
to
stagger
the
unbelief
of
satan
sir
said
i
affecting
a
coolness
that
i
was
far
from
truly
possessing
you
speak
enigmas
and
you
will
perhaps
not
wonder
that
i
hear
you
with
no
very
strong
impression
of
belief
but
i
have
gone
too
far
in
the
way
of
inexplicable
services
to
pause
before
i
see
the
end
it
is
well
replied
my
visitor
lanyon
80
you
remember
your
vows
what
follows
is
under
the
seal
of
our
profession
and
now
you
who
have
so
long
been
bound
to
the
most
narrow
and
material
views
you
who
have
denied
the
virtue
of
transcendental
medicine
you
who
have
derided
your
superiors--
behold
he
put
the
glass
to
his
lips
and
drank
at
one
gulp
a
cry
followed
he
reeled
staggered
clutched
at
the
table
and
held
on
staring
with
injected
eyes
gasping
with
open
mouth
and
as
i
looked
there
came
i
thought
a
change--he
seemed
to
swell--
his
face
became
suddenly
black
and
the
features
seemed
to
melt
and
alter--and
the
next
moment
i
had
sprung
to
my
feet
and
leaped
back
against
the
wall
my
arm
raised
to
shield
me
from
that
prodigy
my
mind
submerged
in
terror
o
god
i
screamed
and
o
god
again
and
again
for
there
before
my
eyes--pale
and
shaken
and
half-fainting
and
groping
before
him
with
his
hands
like
a
man
restored
from
death--
there
stood
henry
jekyll
what
he
told
me
in
the
next
hour
i
cannot
bring
my
mind
to
set
on
paper
i
saw
what
i
saw
i
heard
what
i
heard
and
my
soul
sickened
at
it
and
yet
now
when
that
sight
has
faded
from
my
eyes
i
ask
myself
if
i
believe
it
and
i
cannot
answer
my
life
is
shaken
to
its
roots
sleep
has
left
me
the
deadliest
terror
sits
by
me
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
i
feel
that
my
days
are
numbered
and
that
i
81
must
die
and
yet
i
shall
die
incredulous
as
for
the
moral
turpitude
that
man
unveiled
to
me
even
with
tears
of
penitence
i
cannot
even
in
memory
dwell
on
it
without
a
start
of
horror
i
will
say
but
one
thing
utterson
and
that
if
you
can
bring
your
mind
to
credit
it
will
be
more
than
enough
the
creature
who
crept
into
my
house
that
night
was
on
jekyll's
own
confession
known
by
the
name
of
hyde
and
hunted
for
in
every
corner
of
the
land
as
the
murderer
of
carew
hastie
lanyon
82
henry
jekyll's
full
statement
of
the
case
i
was
born
in
the
year
18---
to
a
large
fortune
endowed
besides
with
excellent
parts
inclined
by
nature
to
industry
fond
of
the
respect
of
the
wise
and
good
among
my
fellow-men
and
thus
as
might
have
been
supposed
with
every
guarantee
of
an
honourable
and
distinguished
future
and
indeed
the
worst
of
my
faults
was
a
certain
impatient
gaiety
of
disposition
such
as
has
made
the
happiness
of
many
but
such
as
i
found
it
hard
to
reconcile
with
my
imperious
desire
to
carry
my
head
high
and
wear
a
more
than
commonly
grave
countenance
before
the
public
hence
it
came
about
that
i
concealed
my
pleasures
and
that
when
i
reached
years
of
reflection
and
began
to
look
round
me
and
take
stock
of
my
progress
and
position
in
the
world
i
stood
already
committed
to
a
profound
duplicity
of
life
many
a
man
would
have
even
blazoned
such
irregularities
as
i
was
guilty
of
but
from
the
high
views
that
i
had
set
before
me
i
regarded
and
hid
them
with
an
almost
morbid
sense
of
shame
it
was
thus
rather
the
exacting
83
nature
of
my
aspirations
than
any
particular
degradation
in
my
faults
that
made
me
what
i
was
and
with
even
a
deeper
trench
than
in
the
majority
of
men
severed
in
me
those
provinces
of
good
and
ill
which
divide
and
compound
man's
dual
nature
in
this
case
i
was
driven
to
reflect
deeply
and
inveterately
on
that
hard
law
of
life
which
lies
at
the
root
of
religion
and
is
one
of
the
most
plentiful
springs
of
distress
though
so
profound
a
double-dealer
i
was
in
no
sense
a
hypocrite
both
sides
of
me
were
in
dead
earnest
i
was
no
more
myself
when
i
laid
aside
restraint
and
plunged
in
shame
than
when
i
laboured
in
the
eye
of
day
at
the
furtherance
of
knowledge
or
the
relief
of
sorrow
and
suffering
and
it
chanced
that
the
direction
of
my
scientific
studies
which
led
wholly
toward
the
mystic
and
the
transcendental
re-acted
and
shed
a
strong
light
on
this
consciousness
of
the
perennial
war
among
my
members
with
every
day
and
from
both
sides
of
my
intelligence
the
moral
and
the
intellectual
i
thus
drew
steadily
nearer
to
that
truth
by
whose
partial
discovery
i
have
been
doomed
to
such
a
dreadful
shipwreck
that
man
is
not
truly
one
but
truly
two
i
say
two
because
the
state
of
my
own
knowledge
does
not
pass
beyond
that
point
others
will
follow
others
will
outstrip
me
on
the
same
lines
and
i
hazard
the
guess
that
man
will
be
ultimately
known
for
a
mere
polity
of
multifarious
incongruous
and
independent
denizens
i
for
my
84
part
from
the
nature
of
my
life
advanced
infallibly
in
one
direction
and
in
one
direction
only
it
was
on
the
moral
side
and
in
my
own
person
that
i
learned
to
recognise
the
thorough
and
primitive
duality
of
man
i
saw
that
of
the
two
natures
that
contended
in
the
field
of
my
consciousness
even
if
i
could
rightly
be
said
to
be
either
it
was
only
because
i
was
radically
both
and
from
an
early
date
even
before
the
course
of
my
scientific
discoveries
had
begun
to
suggest
the
most
naked
possibility
of
such
a
miracle
i
had
learned
to
dwell
with
pleasure
as
a
beloved
day-dream
on
the
thought
of
the
separation
of
these
elements
if
each
i
told
myself
could
but
be
housed
in
separate
identities
life
would
be
relieved
of
all
that
was
unbearable
the
unjust
delivered
from
the
aspirations
might
go
his
way
and
remorse
of
his
more
upright
twin
and
the
just
could
walk
steadfastly
and
securely
on
his
upward
path
doing
the
good
things
in
which
he
found
his
pleasure
and
no
longer
exposed
to
disgrace
and
penitence
by
the
hands
of
this
extraneous
evil
it
was
the
curse
of
mankind
that
these
incongruous
fagots
were
thus
bound
together
that
in
the
agonised
womb
of
consciousness
these
polar
twins
should
be
continuously
struggling
how
then
were
they
dissociated
i
was
so
far
in
my
reflections
when
as
i
have
said
a
side-light
began
to
shine
upon
the
subject
from
the
laboratory
table
i
began
to
perceive
85
more
deeply
than
it
has
ever
yet
been
stated
the
trembling
immateriality
the
mist-like
transience
of
this
seemingly
so
solid
body
in
which
we
walk
attired
certain
agents
i
found
to
have
the
power
to
shake
and
to
pluck
back
that
fleshly
vestment
even
as
a
wind
might
toss
the
curtains
of
a
pavilion
for
two
good
reasons
i
will
not
enter
deeply
into
this
scientific
branch
of
my
confession
first
because
i
have
been
made
to
learn
that
the
doom
and
burthen
of
our
life
is
bound
for
ever
on
man's
shoulders
and
when
the
attempt
is
made
to
cast
it
off
it
but
returns
upon
us
with
more
unfamiliar
and
more
awful
pressure
second
because
as
my
narrative
will
make
alas
too
evident
my
discoveries
were
incomplete
enough
then
that
i
not
only
recognised
my
natural
body
for
the
mere
aura
and
effulgence
of
certain
of
the
powers
that
made
up
my
spirit
but
managed
to
compound
a
drug
by
which
these
powers
should
be
dethroned
from
their
supremacy
and
a
second
form
and
countenance
substituted
none
the
less
natural
to
me
because
they
were
the
expression
and
bore
the
stamp
of
lower
elements
in
my
soul
i
hesitated
long
before
i
put
this
theory
to
the
test
of
practice
i
knew
well
that
i
risked
death
for
any
drug
that
so
potently
controlled
and
shook
the
very
fortress
of
identity
might
by
the
least
scruple
of
an
overdose
or
at
the
least
inopportunity
in
the
moment
of
exhibition
utterly
blot
out
that
immaterial
tabernacle
which
i
86
looked
to
it
to
change
but
the
temptation
of
a
discovery
so
singular
and
profound
at
last
overcame
the
suggestions
of
alarm
i
had
long
since
prepared
my
tincture
i
purchased
at
once
from
a
firm
of
wholesale
chemists
a
large
quantity
of
a
particular
salt
which
i
knew
from
my
experiments
to
be
the
last
ingredient
required
and
late
one
accursed
night
i
compounded
the
elements
watched
them
boil
and
smoke
together
in
the
glass
and
when
the
ebullition
had
subsided
with
a
strong
glow
of
courage
drank
off
the
potion
the
most
racking
pangs
succeeded
a
grinding
in
the
bones
deadly
nausea
and
a
horror
of
the
spirit
that
cannot
be
exceeded
at
the
hour
of
birth
or
death
then
these
agonies
began
swiftly
to
subside
and
i
came
to
myself
as
if
out
of
a
great
sickness
there
was
something
strange
in
my
sensations
something
indescribably
new
and
from
its
very
novelty
incredibly
sweet
i
felt
younger
lighter
happier
in
body
within
i
was
conscious
of
a
heady
recklessness
a
current
of
disordered
sensual
images
running
like
a
mill-race
in
my
fancy
a
solution
of
the
bonds
of
obligation
an
unknown
but
not
an
innocent
freedom
of
the
soul
i
knew
myself
at
the
first
breath
of
this
new
life
to
be
more
wicked
tenfold
more
wicked
sold
a
slave
to
my
original
evil
and
the
thought
in
that
moment
braced
and
delighted
me
like
wine
i
stretched
out
my
hands
exulting
in
the
freshness
of
these
87
sensations
and
in
the
act
i
was
suddenly
aware
that
i
had
lost
in
stature
there
was
no
mirror
at
that
date
in
my
room
that
which
stands
beside
me
as
i
write
was
brought
there
later
on
and
for
the
very
purpose
of
these
transformations
the
night
however
was
far
gone
into
the
morning--the
morning
black
as
it
was
was
nearly
ripe
for
the
conception
of
the
day--the
inmates
of
my
house
were
locked
in
the
most
rigorous
hours
of
slumber
and
i
determined
flushed
as
i
was
with
hope
and
triumph
to
venture
in
my
new
shape
as
far
as
to
my
bedroom
i
crossed
the
yard
wherein
the
constellations
looked
down
upon
me
i
could
have
thought
with
wonder
the
first
creature
of
that
sort
that
their
unsleeping
vigilance
had
yet
disclosed
to
them
i
stole
through
the
corridors
a
stranger
in
my
own
house
and
coming
to
my
room
i
saw
for
the
first
time
the
appearance
of
edward
hyde
i
must
here
speak
by
theory
alone
saying
not
that
which
i
know
but
that
which
i
suppose
to
be
most
probable
the
evil
side
of
my
nature
to
which
i
had
now
transferred
the
stamping
efficacy
was
less
robust
and
less
developed
than
the
good
which
i
had
just
deposed
again
in
the
course
of
my
life
which
had
been
after
all
nine-tenths
a
life
of
effort
virtue
and
control
it
had
been
much
less
exercised
and
much
less
exhausted
and
hence
as
i
think
it
came
about
that
edward
hyde
was
so
much
smaller
88
slighter
and
younger
than
henry
jekyll
even
as
good
shone
upon
the
countenance
of
the
one
evil
was
written
broadly
and
plainly
on
the
face
of
the
other
evil
besides
which
i
must
still
believe
to
be
the
lethal
side
of
man
had
left
on
that
body
an
imprint
of
deformity
and
decay
and
yet
when
i
looked
upon
that
ugly
idol
in
the
glass
i
was
conscious
of
no
repugnance
rather
of
a
leap
of
welcome
this
too
was
myself
it
seemed
natural
and
human
in
my
eyes
it
bore
a
livelier
image
of
the
spirit
it
seemed
more
express
and
single
than
the
imperfect
and
divided
countenance
i
had
been
hitherto
accustomed
to
call
mine
and
in
so
far
i
was
doubtless
right
i
have
observed
that
when
i
wore
the
semblance
of
edward
hyde
none
could
come
near
to
me
at
first
without
a
visible
misgiving
of
the
flesh
this
as
i
take
it
was
because
all
human
beings
as
we
meet
them
are
commingled
out
of
good
and
evil
and
edward
hyde
alone
in
the
ranks
of
mankind
was
pure
evil
i
lingered
but
a
moment
at
the
mirror
the
second
and
conclusive
experiment
had
yet
to
be
attempted
it
yet
remained
to
be
seen
if
i
had
lost
my
identity
beyond
redemption
and
must
flee
before
daylight
from
a
house
that
was
no
longer
mine
and
hurrying
back
to
my
cabinet
i
once
more
prepared
and
drank
the
cup
once
more
suffered
the
pangs
of
dissolution
and
came
to
myself
once
more
with
the
character
the
stature
and
the
face
of
henry
jekyll
89
that
night
i
had
come
to
the
fatal
cross-roads
had
i
approached
my
discovery
in
a
more
noble
spirit
had
i
risked
the
experiment
while
under
the
empire
of
generous
or
pious
aspirations
all
must
have
been
otherwise
and
from
these
agonies
of
death
and
birth
i
had
come
forth
an
angel
instead
of
a
fiend
the
drug
had
no
discriminating
action
it
was
neither
diabolical
nor
divine
it
but
shook
the
doors
of
the
prison-house
of
my
disposition
and
like
the
captives
of
philippi
that
which
stood
within
ran
forth
at
that
time
my
virtue
slumbered
my
evil
kept
awake
by
ambition
was
alert
and
swift
to
seize
the
occasion
and
the
thing
that
was
projected
was
edward
hyde
hence
although
i
had
now
two
characters
as
well
as
two
appearances
one
was
wholly
evil
and
the
other
was
still
the
old
henry
jekyll
that
incongruous
compound
of
whose
reformation
and
improvement
i
had
already
learned
to
despair
the
movement
was
thus
wholly
toward
the
worse
even
at
that
time
i
had
not
yet
conquered
my
aversion
to
the
dryness
of
a
life
of
study
i
would
still
be
merrily
disposed
at
times
and
as
my
pleasures
were
to
say
the
least
undignified
and
i
was
not
only
well
known
and
highly
considered
but
growing
toward
the
elderly
man
this
incoherency
of
my
life
was
daily
growing
more
unwelcome
it
was
on
this
side
that
my
new
power
tempted
me
until
i
fell
in
slavery
i
had
but
to
drink
the
cup
to
doff
at
once
the
body
90
of
the
noted
professor
and
to
assume
like
a
thick
cloak
that
of
edward
hyde
i
smiled
at
the
notion
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
to
be
humorous
and
i
made
my
preparations
with
the
most
studious
care
i
took
and
furnished
that
house
in
soho
to
which
hyde
was
tracked
by
the
police
and
engaged
as
housekeeper
a
creature
whom
i
well
knew
to
be
silent
and
unscrupulous
on
the
other
side
i
announced
to
my
servants
that
a
mr
hyde
whom
i
described
was
to
have
full
liberty
and
power
about
my
house
in
the
square
and
to
parry
mishaps
i
even
called
and
made
myself
a
familiar
object
in
my
second
character
i
next
drew
up
that
will
to
which
you
so
much
objected
so
that
if
anything
befell
me
in
the
person
of
dr
jekyll
i
could
enter
on
that
of
edward
hyde
without
pecuniary
loss
and
thus
fortified
as
i
supposed
on
every
side
i
began
to
profit
by
the
strange
immunities
of
my
position
men
have
before
hired
bravos
to
transact
their
crimes
while
their
own
person
and
reputation
sat
under
shelter
i
was
the
first
that
ever
did
so
for
his
pleasures
i
was
the
first
that
could
thus
plod
in
the
public
eye
with
a
load
of
genial
respectability
and
in
a
moment
like
a
schoolboy
strip
off
these
lendings
and
spring
headlong
into
the
sea
of
liberty
but
for
me
in
my
impenetrable
mantle
the
safety
was
complete
think
of
it--i
did
not
even
exist
let
me
but
escape
into
my
laboratory
door
give
me
but
a
second
or
91
two
to
mix
and
swallow
the
draught
that
i
had
always
standing
ready
and
whatever
he
had
done
edward
hyde
would
pass
away
like
the
stain
of
breath
upon
a
mirror
and
there
in
his
stead
quietly
at
home
trimming
the
midnight
lamp
in
his
study
a
man
who
could
afford
to
laugh
at
suspicion
would
be
henry
jekyll
the
pleasures
which
i
made
haste
to
seek
in
my
disguise
were
as
i
have
said
undignified
i
would
scarce
use
a
harder
term
but
in
the
hands
of
edward
hyde
they
soon
began
to
turn
toward
the
monstrous
when
i
would
come
back
from
these
excursions
i
was
often
plunged
into
a
kind
of
wonder
at
my
vicarious
depravity
this
familiar
that
i
called
out
of
my
own
soul
and
sent
forth
alone
to
do
his
good
pleasure
was
a
being
inherently
malign
and
villainous
his
every
act
and
thought
centred
on
self
drinking
pleasure
with
bestial
avidity
from
any
degree
of
torture
to
another
relentless
like
a
man
of
stone
henry
jekyll
stood
at
times
aghast
before
the
acts
of
edward
hyde
but
the
situation
was
apart
from
ordinary
laws
and
insidiously
relaxed
the
grasp
of
conscience
it
was
hyde
after
all
and
hyde
alone
that
was
guilty
jekyll
was
no
worse
he
woke
again
to
his
good
qualities
seemingly
unimpaired
he
would
even
make
haste
where
it
was
possible
to
undo
the
evil
done
by
hyde
and
thus
his
conscience
slumbered
into
the
details
of
the
infamy
at
which
i
thus
92
connived
for
even
now
i
can
scarce
grant
that
i
committed
it
i
have
no
design
of
entering
i
mean
but
to
point
out
the
warnings
and
the
successive
steps
with
which
my
chastisement
approached
i
met
with
one
accident
which
as
it
brought
on
no
consequence
i
shall
no
more
than
mention
an
act
of
cruelty
to
a
child
aroused
against
me
the
anger
of
a
passer-by
whom
i
recognised
the
other
day
in
the
person
of
your
kinsman
the
doctor
and
the
child's
family
joined
him
there
were
moments
when
i
feared
for
my
life
and
at
last
in
order
to
pacify
their
too
just
resentment
edward
hyde
had
to
bring
them
to
the
door
and
pay
them
in
a
cheque
drawn
in
the
name
of
henry
jekyll
but
this
danger
was
easily
eliminated
from
the
future
by
opening
an
account
at
another
bank
in
the
name
of
edward
hyde
himself
and
when
by
sloping
my
own
hand
backward
i
had
supplied
my
double
with
a
signature
i
thought
i
sat
beyond
the
reach
of
fate
some
two
months
before
the
murder
of
sir
danvers
i
had
been
out
for
one
of
my
adventures
had
returned
at
a
late
hour
and
woke
the
next
day
in
bed
with
somewhat
odd
sensations
it
was
in
vain
i
looked
about
me
in
vain
i
saw
the
decent
furniture
and
tall
proportions
of
my
room
in
the
square
in
vain
that
i
recognised
the
pattern
of
the
bed-curtains
and
the
design
of
the
mahogany
frame
something
still
kept
insisting
that
i
was
not
where
i
was
93
that
i
had
not
wakened
where
i
seemed
to
be
but
in
the
little
room
in
soho
where
i
was
accustomed
to
sleep
in
the
body
of
edward
hyde
i
smiled
to
myself
and
in
my
psychological
way
began
lazily
to
inquire
into
the
elements
of
this
illusion
occasionally
even
as
i
did
so
dropping
back
into
a
comfortable
morning
doze
i
was
still
so
engaged
when
in
one
of
my
more
wakeful
moments
my
eyes
fell
upon
my
hand
now
the
hand
of
henry
jekyll
as
you
have
often
remarked
was
professional
in
shape
and
size
it
was
large
firm
white
and
comely
but
the
hand
which
i
now
saw
clearly
enough
in
the
yellow
light
of
a
mid-london
morning
lying
half
shut
on
the
bed-clothes
was
lean
corded
knuckly
of
a
dusky
pallor
and
thickly
shaded
with
a
swart
growth
of
hair
it
was
the
hand
of
edward
hyde
i
must
have
stared
upon
it
for
near
half
a
minute
sunk
as
i
was
in
the
mere
stupidity
of
wonder
before
terror
woke
up
in
my
breast
as
sudden
and
startling
as
the
crash
of
cymbals
and
bounding
from
my
bed
i
rushed
to
the
mirror
at
the
sight
that
met
my
eyes
my
blood
was
changed
into
something
exquisitely
thin
and
icy
yes
i
had
gone
to
bed
henry
jekyll
i
had
awakened
edward
hyde
how
was
this
to
be
explained
i
asked
myself
and
then
with
another
bound
of
terror--how
was
it
to
be
remedied
it
was
well
on
in
the
morning
the
servants
were
up
all
my
drugs
were
in
the
94
cabinet--a
long
journey
down
two
pairs
of
stairs
through
the
back
passage
across
the
open
court
and
through
the
anatomical
theatre
from
where
i
was
then
standing
horror-struck
it
might
indeed
be
possible
to
cover
my
face
but
of
what
use
was
that
when
i
was
unable
to
conceal
the
alteration
in
my
stature
and
then
with
an
overpowering
sweetness
of
relief
it
came
back
upon
my
mind
that
the
servants
were
already
used
to
the
coming
and
going
of
my
second
self
i
had
soon
dressed
as
well
as
i
was
able
in
clothes
of
my
own
size
had
soon
passed
through
the
house
where
bradshaw
stared
and
drew
back
at
seeing
mr
hyde
at
such
an
hour
and
in
such
a
strange
array
and
ten
minutes
later
dr
jekyll
had
returned
to
his
own
shape
and
was
sitting
down
with
a
darkened
brow
to
make
a
feint
of
breakfasting
small
indeed
was
my
appetite
this
inexplicable
incident
this
reversal
of
my
previous
experience
seemed
like
the
babylonian
finger
on
the
wall
to
be
spelling
out
the
letters
of
my
judgment
and
i
began
to
reflect
more
seriously
than
ever
before
on
the
issues
and
possibilities
of
my
double
existence
that
part
of
me
which
i
had
the
power
of
projecting
had
lately
been
much
exercised
and
nourished
it
had
seemed
to
me
of
late
as
though
the
body
of
edward
hyde
had
grown
in
stature
as
though
when
i
wore
that
form
i
were
conscious
of
a
more
generous
tide
of
blood
and
i
began
to
spy
a
danger
that
95
if
this
were
much
prolonged
the
balance
of
my
nature
might
be
permanently
overthrown
the
power
of
voluntary
change
be
forfeited
and
the
character
of
edward
hyde
become
irrevocably
mine
the
power
of
the
drug
had
not
been
always
equally
displayed
once
very
early
in
my
career
it
had
totally
failed
me
since
then
i
had
been
obliged
on
more
than
one
occasion
to
double
and
once
with
infinite
risk
of
death
to
treble
the
amount
and
these
rare
uncertainties
had
cast
hitherto
the
sole
shadow
on
my
contentment
now
however
and
in
the
light
of
that
morning's
accident
i
was
led
to
remark
that
whereas
in
the
beginning
the
difficulty
had
been
to
throw
off
the
body
of
jekyll
it
had
of
late
gradually
but
decidedly
transferred
itself
to
the
other
side
all
things
therefore
seemed
to
point
to
this
that
i
was
slowly
losing
hold
of
my
original
and
better
self
and
becoming
slowly
incorporated
with
my
second
and
worse
between
these
two
i
now
felt
i
had
to
choose
my
two
natures
had
memory
in
common
but
all
other
faculties
were
most
unequally
shared
between
them
jekyll
who
was
composite
now
with
the
most
sensitive
apprehensions
now
with
a
greedy
gusto
projected
and
shared
in
the
pleasures
and
adventures
of
hyde
but
hyde
was
indifferent
to
jekyll
or
but
remembered
him
as
the
mountain
bandit
remembers
the
cavern
in
which
he
conceals
himself
from
pursuit
jekyll
had
more
than
a
father's
interest
hyde
96
had
more
than
a
son's
indifference
to
cast
in
my
lot
with
jekyll
was
to
die
to
those
appetites
which
i
had
long
secretly
indulged
and
had
of
late
begun
to
pamper
to
cast
it
in
with
hyde
was
to
die
to
a
thousand
interests
and
aspirations
and
to
become
at
a
blow
and
for
ever
despised
and
friendless
the
bargain
might
appear
unequal
but
there
was
still
another
consideration
in
the
scales
for
while
jekyll
would
suffer
smartingly
in
the
fires
of
abstinence
hyde
would
be
not
even
conscious
of
all
that
he
had
lost
strange
as
my
circumstances
were
the
terms
of
this
debate
are
as
old
and
commonplace
as
man
much
the
same
inducements
and
alarms
cast
the
die
for
any
tempted
and
trembling
sinner
and
it
fell
out
with
me
as
it
falls
with
so
vast
a
majority
of
my
fellows
that
i
chose
the
better
part
and
was
found
wanting
in
the
strength
to
keep
to
it
yes
i
preferred
the
elderly
and
discontented
doctor
surrounded
by
friends
and
cherishing
honest
hopes
and
bade
a
resolute
farewell
to
the
liberty
the
comparative
youth
the
light
step
leaping
impulses
and
secret
pleasures
that
i
had
enjoyed
in
the
disguise
of
hyde
i
made
this
choice
perhaps
with
some
unconscious
reservation
for
i
neither
gave
up
the
house
in
soho
nor
destroyed
the
clothes
of
edward
hyde
which
still
lay
ready
in
my
cabinet
for
two
months
however
i
was
true
to
my
determination
for
two
months
i
led
a
life
of
such
97
severity
as
i
had
never
before
attained
to
and
enjoyed
the
compensations
of
an
approving
conscience
but
time
began
at
last
to
obliterate
the
freshness
of
my
alarm
the
praises
of
conscience
began
to
grow
into
a
thing
of
course
i
began
to
be
tortured
with
throes
and
longings
as
of
hyde
struggling
after
freedom
and
at
last
in
an
hour
of
moral
weakness
i
once
again
compounded
and
swallowed
the
transforming
draught
i
do
not
suppose
that
when
a
drunkard
reasons
with
himself
upon
his
vice
he
is
once
out
of
five
hundred
times
affected
by
the
dangers
that
he
runs
through
his
brutish
physical
insensibility
neither
had
i
long
as
i
had
considered
my
position
made
enough
allowance
for
the
complete
moral
insensibility
and
insensate
readiness
to
evil
which
were
the
leading
characters
of
edward
hyde
yet
it
was
by
these
that
i
was
punished
my
devil
had
been
long
caged
he
came
out
roaring
i
was
conscious
even
when
i
took
the
draught
of
a
more
unbridled
a
more
furious
propensity
to
ill
it
must
have
been
this
i
suppose
that
stirred
in
my
soul
that
tempest
of
impatience
with
which
i
listened
to
the
civilities
of
my
unhappy
victim
i
declare
at
least
before
god
no
man
morally
sane
could
have
been
guilty
of
that
crime
upon
so
pitiful
a
provocation
and
that
i
struck
in
no
more
reasonable
spirit
than
that
in
which
a
sick
child
may
break
a
plaything
but
i
had
voluntarily
stripped
myself
of
all
those
balancing
instincts
98
by
which
even
the
worst
of
us
continues
to
walk
with
some
degree
of
steadiness
among
temptations
and
in
my
case
to
be
tempted
however
slightly
was
to
fall
instantly
the
spirit
of
hell
awoke
in
me
and
raged
with
a
transport
of
glee
i
mauled
the
unresisting
body
tasting
delight
from
every
blow
and
it
was
not
till
weariness
had
begun
to
succeed
that
i
was
suddenly
in
the
top
fit
of
my
delirium
struck
through
the
heart
by
a
cold
thrill
of
terror
a
mist
dispersed
i
saw
my
life
to
be
forfeit
and
fled
from
the
scene
of
these
excesses
at
once
glorying
and
trembling
my
lust
of
evil
gratified
and
stimulated
my
love
of
life
screwed
to
the
topmost
peg
i
ran
to
the
house
in
soho
and
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
destroyed
my
papers
thence
i
set
out
through
the
lamplit
streets
in
the
same
divided
ecstasy
of
mind
gloating
on
my
crime
light-headedly
devising
others
in
the
future
and
yet
still
hastening
and
still
hearkening
in
my
wake
for
the
steps
of
the
avenger
hyde
had
a
song
upon
his
lips
as
he
compounded
the
draught
and
as
he
drank
it
pledged
the
dead
man
the
pangs
of
transformation
had
not
done
tearing
him
before
henry
jekyll
with
streaming
tears
of
gratitude
and
remorse
had
fallen
upon
his
knees
and
lifted
his
clasped
hands
to
god
the
veil
of
self-indulgence
was
rent
from
head
to
foot
i
saw
my
life
as
a
whole
i
followed
it
up
from
the
days
of
childhood
when
i
had
walked
99
with
my
father's
hand
and
through
the
self-denying
toils
of
my
professional
life
to
arrive
again
and
again
with
the
same
sense
of
unreality
at
the
damned
horrors
of
the
evening
i
could
have
screamed
aloud
i
sought
with
tears
and
prayers
to
smother
down
the
crowd
of
hideous
images
and
sounds
with
which
my
memory
swarmed
against
me
and
still
between
the
petitions
the
ugly
face
of
my
iniquity
stared
into
my
soul
as
the
acuteness
of
this
remorse
began
to
die
away
it
was
succeeded
by
a
sense
of
joy
the
problem
of
my
conduct
was
solved
hyde
was
thenceforth
impossible
whether
i
would
or
not
i
was
now
confined
to
the
better
part
of
my
existence
and
oh
how
i
rejoiced
to
think
it
with
what
willing
humility
i
embraced
anew
the
restrictions
of
natural
life
with
what
sincere
renunciation
i
locked
the
door
by
which
i
had
so
often
gone
and
come
and
ground
the
key
under
my
heel
the
next
day
came
the
news
that
the
murder
had
been
overlooked
that
the
guilt
of
hyde
was
patent
to
the
world
and
that
the
victim
was
a
man
high
in
public
estimation
it
was
not
only
a
crime
it
had
been
a
tragic
folly
i
think
i
was
glad
to
know
it
i
think
i
was
glad
to
have
my
better
impulses
thus
buttressed
and
guarded
by
the
terrors
of
the
scaffold
jekyll
was
now
my
city
of
refuge
let
but
hyde
peep
out
an
instant
and
the
hands
of
all
men
would
be
raised
to
take
and
slay
him
100
i
resolved
in
my
future
conduct
to
redeem
the
past
and
i
can
say
with
honesty
that
my
resolve
was
fruitful
of
some
good
you
know
yourself
how
earnestly
in
the
last
months
of
last
year
i
laboured
to
relieve
suffering
you
know
that
much
was
done
for
others
and
that
the
days
passed
quietly
almost
happily
for
myself
nor
can
i
truly
say
that
i
wearied
of
this
beneficent
and
innocent
life
i
think
instead
that
i
daily
enjoyed
it
more
completely
but
i
was
still
cursed
with
my
duality
of
purpose
and
as
the
first
edge
of
my
penitence
wore
off
the
lower
side
of
me
so
long
indulged
so
recently
chained
down
began
to
growl
for
licence
not
that
i
dreamed
of
resuscitating
hyde
the
bare
idea
of
that
would
startle
me
to
frenzy
no
it
was
in
my
own
person
that
i
was
once
more
tempted
to
trifle
with
my
conscience
and
it
was
as
an
ordinary
secret
sinner
that
i
at
last
fell
before
the
assaults
of
temptation
there
comes
an
end
to
all
things
the
most
capacious
measure
is
filled
at
last
and
this
brief
condescension
to
evil
finally
destroyed
the
balance
of
my
soul
and
yet
i
was
not
alarmed
the
fall
seemed
natural
like
a
return
to
the
old
days
before
i
had
made
discovery
it
was
a
fine
clear
january
day
wet
under
foot
where
the
frost
had
melted
but
cloudless
overhead
and
the
regent's
park
was
full
of
winter
chirrupings
and
sweet
with
spring
odours
i
sat
in
the
sun
on
a
bench
the
animal
within
me
licking
the
101
chops
of
memory
the
spiritual
side
a
little
drowsed
promising
subsequent
penitence
but
not
yet
moved
to
begin
after
all
i
reflected
i
was
like
my
neighbours
and
then
i
smiled
comparing
myself
with
other
men
comparing
my
active
goodwill
with
the
lazy
cruelty
of
their
neglect
and
at
the
very
moment
of
that
vain-glorious
thought
a
qualm
came
over
me
a
horrid
nausea
and
the
most
deadly
shuddering
these
passed
away
and
left
me
faint
and
then
as
in
its
turn
the
faintness
subsided
i
began
to
be
aware
of
a
change
in
the
temper
of
my
thoughts
a
greater
boldness
a
contempt
of
danger
a
solution
of
the
bonds
of
obligation
i
looked
down
my
clothes
hung
formlessly
on
my
shrunken
limbs
the
hand
that
lay
on
my
knee
was
corded
and
hairy
i
was
once
more
edward
hyde
a
moment
before
i
had
been
safe
of
all
men's
respect
wealthy
beloved--the
cloth
laying
for
me
in
the
dining-room
at
home
and
now
i
was
the
common
quarry
of
mankind
hunted
houseless
a
known
murderer
thrall
to
the
gallows
my
reason
wavered
but
it
did
not
fail
me
utterly
i
have
more
than
once
observed
that
in
my
second
character
my
faculties
seemed
sharpened
to
a
point
and
my
spirits
more
tensely
elastic
thus
it
came
about
that
where
jekyll
perhaps
might
have
succumbed
hyde
rose
to
the
importance
of
the
moment
my
drugs
were
in
one
of
the
presses
of
my
cabinet
how
was
i
102
to
reach
them
that
was
the
problem
that
crushing
my
temples
in
my
hands
i
set
myself
to
solve
the
laboratory
door
i
had
closed
if
i
sought
to
enter
by
the
house
my
own
servants
would
consign
me
to
the
gallows
i
saw
i
must
employ
another
hand
and
thought
of
lanyon
how
was
he
to
be
reached
how
persuaded
supposing
that
i
escaped
capture
in
the
streets
how
was
i
to
make
my
way
into
his
presence
and
how
should
i
an
unknown
and
displeasing
visitor
prevail
on
the
famous
physician
to
rifle
the
study
of
his
colleague
dr
jekyll
then
i
remembered
that
of
my
original
character
one
part
remained
to
me
i
could
write
my
own
hand
and
once
i
had
conceived
that
kindling
spark
the
way
that
i
must
follow
became
lighted
up
from
end
to
end
thereupon
i
arranged
my
clothes
as
best
i
could
and
summoning
a
passing
hansom
drove
to
an
hotel
in
portland
street
the
name
of
which
i
chanced
to
remember
at
my
appearance
which
was
indeed
comical
enough
however
tragic
a
fate
these
garments
covered
the
driver
could
not
conceal
his
mirth
i
gnashed
my
teeth
upon
him
with
a
gust
of
devilish
fury
and
the
smile
withered
from
his
face--happily
for
him--yet
more
happily
for
myself
for
in
another
instant
i
had
certainly
dragged
him
from
his
perch
at
the
inn
as
i
entered
i
looked
about
me
with
so
black
a
countenance
as
made
the
attendants
tremble
not
a
look
did
they
exchange
in
my
103
presence
but
obsequiously
took
my
orders
led
me
to
a
private
room
and
brought
me
wherewithal
to
write
hyde
in
danger
of
his
life
was
a
creature
new
to
me
shaken
with
inordinate
anger
strung
to
the
pitch
of
murder
lusting
to
inflict
pain
yet
the
creature
was
astute
mastered
his
fury
with
a
great
effort
of
the
will
composed
his
two
important
letters
one
to
lanyon
and
one
to
poole
and
that
he
might
receive
actual
evidence
of
their
being
posted
sent
them
out
with
directions
that
they
should
be
registered
thenceforward
he
sat
all
day
over
the
fire
in
the
private
room
gnawing
his
nails
there
he
dined
sitting
alone
with
his
fears
the
waiter
visibly
quailing
before
his
eye
and
thence
when
the
night
was
fully
come
he
set
forth
in
the
corner
of
a
closed
cab
and
was
driven
to
and
fro
about
the
streets
of
the
city
he
i
say--i
cannot
say
i
that
child
of
hell
had
nothing
human
nothing
lived
in
him
but
fear
and
hatred
and
when
at
last
thinking
the
driver
had
begun
to
grow
suspicious
he
discharged
the
cab
and
ventured
on
foot
attired
in
his
misfitting
clothes
an
object
marked
out
for
observation
into
the
midst
of
the
nocturnal
passengers
these
two
base
passions
raged
within
him
like
a
tempest
he
walked
fast
hunted
by
his
fears
chattering
to
himself
skulking
through
the
less-frequented
thoroughfares
counting
the
minutes
that
still
divided
him
from
midnight
once
a
104
woman
spoke
to
him
offering
i
think
a
box
of
lights
he
smote
her
in
the
face
and
she
fled
when
i
came
to
myself
at
lanyon's
the
horror
of
my
old
friend
perhaps
affected
me
somewhat
i
do
not
know
it
was
at
least
but
a
drop
in
the
sea
to
the
abhorrence
with
which
i
looked
back
upon
these
hours
a
change
had
come
over
me
it
was
no
longer
the
fear
of
the
gallows
it
was
the
horror
of
being
hyde
that
racked
me
i
received
lanyon's
condemnation
partly
in
a
dream
it
was
partly
in
a
dream
that
i
came
home
to
my
own
house
and
got
into
bed
i
slept
after
the
prostration
of
the
day
with
a
stringent
and
profound
slumber
which
not
even
the
nightmares
that
wrung
me
could
avail
to
break
i
awoke
in
the
morning
shaken
weakened
but
refreshed
i
still
hated
and
feared
the
thought
of
the
brute
that
slept
within
me
and
i
had
not
of
course
forgotten
the
appalling
dangers
of
the
day
before
but
i
was
once
more
at
home
in
my
own
house
and
close
to
my
drugs
and
gratitude
for
my
escape
shone
so
strong
in
my
soul
that
it
almost
rivalled
the
brightness
of
hope
i
was
stepping
leisurely
across
the
court
after
breakfast
drinking
the
chill
of
the
air
with
pleasure
when
i
was
seized
again
with
those
indescribable
sensations
that
heralded
the
change
and
i
had
but
the
time
to
gain
the
shelter
of
my
cabinet
before
i
was
once
again
raging
and
freezing
with
the
passions
of
hyde
it
took
on
this
occasion
a
double
dose
to
recall
me
to
105
myself
and
alas
six
hours
after
as
i
sat
looking
sadly
in
the
fire
the
pangs
returned
and
the
drug
had
to
be
re-administered
in
short
from
that
day
forth
it
seemed
only
by
a
great
effort
as
of
gymnastics
and
only
under
the
immediate
stimulation
of
the
drug
that
i
was
able
to
wear
the
countenance
of
jekyll
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
i
would
be
taken
with
the
premonitory
shudder
above
all
if
i
slept
or
even
dozed
for
a
moment
in
my
chair
it
was
always
as
hyde
that
i
awakened
under
the
strain
of
this
continually-impending
doom
and
by
the
sleeplessness
to
which
i
now
condemned
myself
ay
even
beyond
what
i
had
thought
possible
to
man
i
became
in
my
own
person
a
creature
eaten
up
and
emptied
by
fever
languidly
weak
both
in
body
and
mind
and
solely
occupied
by
one
thought
the
horror
of
my
other
self
but
when
i
slept
or
when
the
virtue
of
the
medicine
wore
off
i
would
leap
almost
without
transition
for
the
pangs
of
transformation
grew
daily
less
marked
into
the
possession
of
a
fancy
brimming
with
images
of
terror
a
soul
boiling
with
causeless
hatreds
and
a
body
that
seemed
not
strong
enough
to
contain
the
raging
energies
of
life
the
powers
of
hyde
seemed
to
have
grown
with
the
sickliness
of
jekyll
and
certainly
the
hate
that
now
divided
them
was
equal
on
each
side
with
jekyll
it
was
a
thing
of
vital
instinct
he
had
now
seen
the
full
deformity
of
that
creature
that
shared
with
him
some
of
the
phenomena
of
106
consciousness
and
was
co-heir
with
him
to
death
and
beyond
these
links
of
community
which
in
themselves
made
the
most
poignant
part
of
his
distress
he
thought
of
hyde
for
all
his
energy
of
life
as
of
something
not
only
hellish
but
inorganic
this
was
the
shocking
thing
that
the
slime
of
the
pit
seemed
to
utter
cries
and
voices
that
the
amorphous
dust
gesticulated
and
sinned
that
what
was
dead
and
had
no
shape
should
usurp
the
offices
of
life
and
this
again
that
that
insurgent
horror
was
knit
to
him
closer
than
a
wife
closer
than
an
eye
lay
caged
in
his
flesh
where
he
heard
it
mutter
and
felt
it
struggle
to
be
born
and
at
every
hour
of
weakness
and
in
the
confidence
of
slumber
prevailed
against
him
and
deposed
him
out
of
life
the
hatred
of
hyde
for
jekyll
was
of
a
different
order
his
terror
of
the
gallows
drove
him
continually
to
commit
temporary
suicide
and
return
to
his
subordinate
station
of
a
part
instead
of
a
person
but
he
loathed
the
necessity
he
loathed
the
despondency
into
which
jekyll
was
now
fallen
and
he
resented
the
dislike
with
which
he
was
himself
regarded
hence
the
ape-like
tricks
that
he
would
play
me
scrawling
in
my
own
hand
blasphemies
on
the
pages
of
my
books
burning
the
letters
and
destroying
the
portrait
of
my
father
and
indeed
had
it
not
been
for
his
fear
of
death
he
would
long
ago
have
ruined
himself
in
order
to
involve
me
in
the
ruin
but
his
love
of
life
is
wonderful
i
go
further
i
who
sicken
107
and
freeze
at
the
mere
thought
of
him
when
i
recall
the
abjection
and
passion
of
this
attachment
and
when
i
know
how
he
fears
my
power
to
cut
him
off
by
suicide
i
find
it
in
my
heart
to
pity
him
it
is
useless
and
the
time
awfully
fails
me
to
prolong
this
description
no
one
has
ever
suffered
such
torments
let
that
suffice
and
yet
even
to
these
habit
brought--no
not
alleviation--but
a
certain
callousness
of
soul
a
certain
acquiescence
of
despair
and
my
punishment
might
have
gone
on
for
years
but
for
the
last
calamity
which
has
now
fallen
and
which
has
finally
severed
me
from
my
own
face
and
nature
my
provision
of
the
salt
which
had
never
been
renewed
since
the
date
of
the
first
experiment
began
to
run
low
i
sent
out
for
a
fresh
supply
and
mixed
the
draught
the
ebullition
followed
and
the
first
change
of
colour
not
the
second
i
drank
it
and
it
was
without
efficiency
you
will
learn
from
poole
how
i
have
had
london
ransacked
it
was
in
vain
and
i
am
now
persuaded
that
my
first
supply
was
impure
and
that
it
was
that
unknown
impurity
which
lent
efficacy
to
the
draught
about
a
week
has
passed
and
i
am
now
finishing
this
statement
under
the
influence
of
the
last
of
the
old
powders
this
then
is
the
last
time
short
of
a
miracle
that
henry
jekyll
can
think
his
own
thoughts
or
see
his
own
face
now
how
sadly
altered
in
the
glass
nor
must
i
delay
108
too
long
to
bring
my
writing
to
an
end
for
if
my
narrative
has
hitherto
escaped
destruction
it
has
been
by
a
combination
of
great
prudence
and
great
good
luck
should
the
throes
of
change
take
me
in
the
act
of
writing
it
hyde
will
tear
it
in
pieces
but
if
some
time
shall
have
elapsed
after
i
have
laid
it
by
his
wonderful
selfishness
and
circumscription
to
the
moment
will
probably
save
it
once
again
from
the
action
of
his
ape-like
spite
and
indeed
the
doom
that
is
closing
on
us
both
has
already
changed
and
crushed
him
half
an
hour
from
now
when
i
shall
again
and
for
ever
re-indue
that
hated
personality
i
know
how
i
shall
sit
shuddering
and
weeping
in
my
chair
or
continue
with
the
most
strained
and
fear-struck
ecstasy
of
listening
to
pace
up
and
down
this
room
my
last
earthly
refuge
and
give
ear
to
every
sound
of
menace
will
hyde
die
upon
the
scaffold
or
will
he
find
courage
to
release
himself
at
the
last
moment
god
knows
i
am
careless
this
is
my
true
hour
of
death
and
what
is
to
follow
concerns
another
than
myself
here
then
as
i
lay
down
the
pen
and
proceed
to
seal
up
my
confession
i
bring
the
life
of
that
unhappy
henry

an
end
