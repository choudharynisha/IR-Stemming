the
red
death
had
long
devastated
the
country
no
pestilence
had
ever
been
so
fatal
or
so
hideous
blood
was
its
avatar
and
its
seal--the
redness
and
the
horror
of
blood
there
were
sharp
pains
and
sudden
dizziness
and
then
profuse
bleeding
at
the
pores
with
dissolution
the
scarlet
stains
upon
the
body
and
especially
upon
the
face
of
the
victim
were
the
pest
ban
which
shut
him
out
from
the
aid
and
from
the
sympathy
of
his
fellow-men
and
the
whole
seizure
progress
and
termination
of
the
disease
were
the
incidents
of
half
an
hour
but
the
prince
prospero
was
happy
and
dauntless
and
sagacious
when
his
dominions
were
half
depopulated
he
summoned
to
his
presence
a
thousand
hale
and
light-hearted
friends
from
among
the
knights
and
dames
of
his
court
and
with
these
retired
to
the
deep
seclusion
of
one
of
his
castellated
abbeys
this
was
an
extensive
and
magnificent
structure
the
creation
of
the
prince's
own
eccentric
yet
august
taste
a
strong
and
lofty
wall
girdled
it
in
this
wall
had
gates
of
iron
the
courtiers
having
entered
brought
furnaces
and
massy
hammers
and
welded
the
bolts
they
resolved
to
leave
means
neither
of
ingress
nor
egress
to
the
sudden
impulses
of
despair
or
of
frenzy
from
within
the
abbey
was
amply
provisioned
with
such
precautions
the
courtiers
might
bid
defiance
to
contagion
the
external
world
could
take
care
of
itself
in
the
meantime
it
was
folly
to
grieve
or
to
think
the
prince
had
provided
all
the
appliances
of
pleasure
there
were
buffoons
there
were
improvisatori
there
were
ballet-dancers
there
were
musicians
there
was
beauty
there
was
wine
all
these
and
security
were
within
without
was
the
red
death
it
was
towards
the
close
of
the
fifth
or
sixth
month
of
his
seclusion
and
while
the
pestilence
raged
most
furiously
abroad
that
the
prince
prospero
entertained
his
thousand
friends
at
a
masked
ball
of
the
most
unusual
magnificence
it
was
a
voluptuous
scene
that
masquerade
but
first
let
me
tell
of
the
rooms
in
which
it
was
held
these
were
seven--an
imperial
suite
in
many
palaces
however
such
suites
form
a
long
and
straight
vista
while
the
folding
doors
slide
back
nearly
to
the
walls
on
either
hand
so
that
the
view
of
the
whole
extent
is
scarcely
impeded
here
the
case
was
very
different
as
might
have
been
expected
from
the
duke's
love
of
the
bizarre
the
apartments
were
so
irregularly
disposed
that
the
vision
embraced
but
little
more
than
one
at
a
time
there
was
a
sharp
turn
at
every
twenty
or
thirty
yards
and
at
each
turn
a
novel
effect
to
the
right
and
left
in
the
middle
of
each
wall
a
tall
and
narrow
gothic
window
looked
out
upon
a
closed
corridor
which
pursued
the
windings
of
the
suite
these
windows
were
of
stained
glass
whose
colour
varied
in
accordance
with
the
prevailing
hue
of
the
decorations
of
the
chamber
into
which
it
opened
that
at
the
eastern
extremity
was
hung
for
example
in
blue--and
vividly
blue
were
its
windows
the
second
chamber
was
purple
in
its
ornaments
and
tapestries
and
here
the
panes
were
purple
the
third
was
green
throughout
and
so
were
the
casements
the
fourth
was
furnished
and
lighted
with
orange--the
fifth
with
white--the
sixth
with
violet
the
seventh
apartment
was
closely
shrouded
in
black
velvet
tapestries
that
hung
all
over
the
ceiling
and
down
the
walls
falling
in
heavy
folds
upon
a
carpet
of
the
same
material
and
hue
but
in
this
chamber
only
the
colour
of
the
windows
failed
to
correspond
with
the
decorations
the
panes
here
were
scarlet--a
deep
blood
colour
now
in
no
one
of
the
seven
apartments
was
there
any
lamp
or
candelabrum
amid
the
profusion
of
golden
ornaments
that
lay
scattered
to
and
fro
or
depended
from
the
roof
there
was
no
light
of
any
kind
emanating
from
lamp
or
candle
within
the
suite
of
chambers
but
in
the
corridors
that
followed
the
suite
there
stood
opposite
to
each
window
a
heavy
tripod
bearing
a
brazier
of
fire
that
projected
its
rays
through
the
tinted
glass
and
so
glaringly
illumined
the
room
and
thus
were
produced
a
multitude
of
gaudy
and
fantastic
appearances
but
in
the
western
or
black
chamber
the
effect
of
the
fire-light
that
streamed
upon
the
dark
hangings
through
the
blood-tinted
panes
was
ghastly
in
the
extreme
and
produced
so
wild
a
look
upon
the
countenances
of
those
who
entered
that
there
were
few
of
the
company
bold
enough
to
set
foot
within
its
precincts
at
all
it
was
in
this
apartment
also
that
there
stood
against
the
western
wall
a
gigantic
clock
of
ebony
its
pendulum
swung
to
and
fro
with
a
dull
heavy
monotonous
clang
and
when
the
minute-hand
made
the
circuit
of
the
face
and
the
hour
was
to
be
stricken
there
came
from
the
brazen
lungs
of
the
clock
a
sound
which
was
clear
and
loud
and
deep
and
exceedingly
musical
but
of
so
peculiar
a
note
and
emphasis
that
at
each
lapse
of
an
hour
the
musicians
of
the
orchestra
were
constrained
to
pause
momentarily
in
their
performance
to
harken
to
the
sound
and
thus
the
waltzers
perforce
ceased
their
evolutions
and
there
was
a
brief
disconcert
of
the
whole
gay
company
and
while
the
chimes
of
the
clock
yet
rang
it
was
observed
that
the
giddiest
grew
pale
and
the
more
aged
and
sedate
passed
their
hands
over
their
brows
as
if
in
confused
revery
or
meditation
but
when
the
echoes
had
fully
ceased
a
light
laughter
at
once
pervaded
the
assembly
the
musicians
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
as
if
at
their
own
nervousness
and
folly
and
made
whispering
vows
each
to
the
other
that
the
next
chiming
of
the
clock
should
produce
in
them
no
similar
emotion
and
then
after
the
lapse
of
sixty
minutes
which
embrace
three
thousand
and
six
hundred
seconds
of
the
time
that
flies
there
came
yet
another
chiming
of
the
clock
and
then
were
the
same
disconcert
and
tremulousness
and
meditation
as
before
but
in
spite
of
these
things
it
was
a
gay
and
magnificent
revel
the
tastes
of
the
duke
were
peculiar
he
had
a
fine
eye
for
colours
and
effects
he
disregarded
the
decora
of
mere
fashion
his
plans
were
bold
and
fiery
and
his
conceptions
glowed
with
barbaric
lustre
there
are
some
who
would
have
thought
him
mad
his
followers
felt
that
he
was
not
it
was
necessary
to
hear
and
see
and
touch
him
to
be
sure
that
he
was
not
he
had
directed
in
great
part
the
movable
embellishments
of
the
seven
chambers
upon
occasion
of
this
great
fãªte
and
it
was
his
own
guiding
taste
which
had
given
character
to
the
masqueraders
be
sure
they
were
grotesque
there
were
much
glare
and
glitter
and
piquancy
and
phantasm--much
of
what
has
been
since
seen
in
hernani
there
were
arabesque
figures
with
unsuited
limbs
and
appointments
there
were
delirious
fancies
such
as
the
madman
fashions
there
were
much
of
the
beautiful
much
of
the
wanton
much
of
the
bizarre
something
of
the
terrible
and
not
a
little
of
that
which
might
have
excited
disgust
to
and
fro
in
the
seven
chambers
there
stalked
in
fact
a
multitude
of
dreams
and
these--the
dreams--writhed
in
and
about
taking
hue
from
the
rooms
and
causing
the
wild
music
of
the
orchestra
to
seem
as
the
echo
of
their
steps
and
anon
there
strikes
the
ebony
clock
which
stands
in
the
hall
of
the
velvet
and
then
for
a
moment
all
is
still
and
all
is
silent
save
the
voice
of
the
clock
the
dreams
are
stiff-frozen
as
they
stand
but
the
echoes
of
the
chime
die
away--they
have
endured
but
an
instant--and
a
light
half-subdued
laughter
floats
after
them
as
they
depart
and
now
again
the
music
swells
and
the
dreams
live
and
writhe
to
and
fro
more
merrily
than
ever
taking
hue
from
the
many
tinted
windows
through
which
stream
the
rays
from
the
tripods
but
to
the
chamber
which
lies
most
westwardly
of
the
seven
there
are
now
none
of
the
maskers
who
venture
for
the
night
is
waning
away
and
there
flows
a
ruddier
light
through
the
blood-coloured
panes
and
the
blackness
of
the
sable
drapery
appals
and
to
him
whose
foot
falls
upon
the
sable
carpet
there
comes
from
the
near
clock
of
ebony
a
muffled
peal
more
solemnly
emphatic
than
any
which
reaches
their
ears
who
indulged
in
the
more
remote
gaieties
of
the
other
apartments
but
these
other
apartments
were
densely
crowded
and
in
them
beat
feverishly
the
heart
of
life
and
the
revel
went
whirlingly
on
until
at
length
there
commenced
the
sounding
of
midnight
upon
the
clock
and
then
the
music
ceased
as
i
have
told
and
the
evolutions
of
the
waltzers
were
quieted
and
there
was
an
uneasy
cessation
of
all
things
as
before
but
now
there
were
twelve
strokes
to
be
sounded
by
the
bell
of
the
clock
and
thus
it
happened
perhaps
that
more
of
thought
crept
with
more
of
time
into
the
meditations
of
the
thoughtful
among
those
who
revelled
and
thus
too
it
happened
perhaps
that
before
the
last
echoes
of
the
last
chime
had
utterly
sunk
into
silence
there
were
many
individuals
in
the
crowd
who
had
found
leisure
to
become
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
masked
figure
which
had
arrested
the
attention
of
no
single
individual
before
and
the
rumour
of
this
new
presence
having
spread
itself
whisperingly
around
there
arose
at
length
from
the
whole
company
a
buzz
or
murmur
expressive
of
disapprobation
and
surprise--then
finally
of
terror
of
horror
and
of
disgust
in
an
assembly
of
phantasms
such
as
i
have
painted
it
may
well
be
supposed
that
no
ordinary
appearance
could
have
excited
such
sensation
in
truth
the
masquerade
licence
of
the
night
was
nearly
unlimited
but
the
figure
in
question
had
out-heroded
herod
and
gone
beyond
the
bounds
of
even
the
prince's
indefinite
decorum
there
are
chords
in
the
hearts
of
the
most
reckless
which
cannot
be
touched
without
emotion
even
with
the
utterly
lost
to
whom
life
and
death
are
equally
jests
there
are
matters
of
which
no
jest
can
be
made
the
whole
company
indeed
seemed
now
deeply
to
feel
that
in
the
costume
and
bearing
of
the
stranger
neither
wit
nor
propriety
existed
the
figure
was
tall
and
gaunt
and
shrouded
from
head
to
foot
in
the
habiliments
of
the
grave
the
mask
which
concealed
the
visage
was
made
so
nearly
to
resemble
the
countenance
of
a
stiffened
corpse
that
the
closest
scrutiny
must
have
had
difficulty
in
detecting
the
cheat
and
yet
all
this
might
have
been
endured
if
not
approved
by
the
mad
revellers
around
but
the
mummer
had
gone
so
far
as
to
assume
the
type
of
the
red
death
his
vesture
was
dabbled
in
blood--and
his
broad
brow
with
all
the
features
of
the
face
was
besprinkled
with
the
scarlet
horror
when
the
eyes
of
the
prince
prospero
fell
upon
this
spectral
image
which
with
a
slow
and
solemn
movement
as
if
more
fully
to
sustain
its
role
stalked
to
and
fro
among
the
waltzers
he
was
seen
to
be
convulsed
in
the
first
moment
with
a
strong
shudder
either
of
terror
or
distaste
but
in
the
next
his
brow
reddened
with
rage
who
dares--he
demanded
hoarsely
of
the
courtiers
who
stood
near
him--who
dares
insult
us
with
this
blasphemous
mockery
seize
him
and
unmask
him--that
we
may
know
whom
we
have
to
hang
at
sunrise
from
the
battlements
it
was
in
the
eastern
or
blue
chamber
in
which
stood
the
prince
prospero
as
he
uttered
these
words
they
rang
throughout
the
seven
rooms
loudly
and
clearly
for
the
prince
was
a
bold
and
robust
man
and
the
music
had
become
hushed
at
the
waving
of
his
hand
it
was
in
the
blue
room
where
stood
the
prince
with
a
group
of
pale
courtiers
by
his
side
at
first
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
slight
rushing
movement
of
this
group
in
the
direction
of
the
intruder
who
at
the
moment
was
also
near
at
hand
and
now
with
deliberate
and
stately
step
made
closer
approach
to
the
speaker
but
from
a
certain
nameless
awe
with
which
the
mad
assumptions
of
the
mummer
had
inspired
the
whole
party
there
were
found
none
who
put
forth
hand
to
seize
him
so
that
unimpeded
he
passed
within
a
yard
of
the
prince's
person
and
while
the
vast
assembly
as
if
with
one
impulse
shrank
from
the
centres
of
the
rooms
to
the
walls
he
made
his
way
uninterruptedly
but
with
the
same
solemn
and
measured
step
which
had
distinguished
him
from
the
first
through
the
blue
chamber
to
the
purple--through
the
purple
to
the
green--through
the
green
to
the
orange--through
this
again
to
the
white--and
even
thence
to
the
violet
ere
a
decided
movement
had
been
made
to
arrest
him
it
was
then
however
that
the
prince
prospero
maddening
with
rage
and
the
shame
of
his
own
momentary
cowardice
rushed
hurriedly
through
the
six
chambers
while
none
followed
him
on
account
of
a
deadly
terror
that
had
seized
upon
all
he
bore
aloft
a
drawn
dagger
and
had
approached
in
rapid
impetuosity
to
within
three
or
four
feet
of
the
retreating
figure
when
the
latter
having
attained
the
extremity
of
the
velvet
apartment
turned
suddenly
and
confronted
his
pursuer
there
was
a
sharp
cry--and
the
dagger
dropped
gleaming
upon
the
sable
carpet
upon
which
instantly
afterwards
fell
prostrate
in
death
the
prince
prospero
then
summoning
the
wild
courage
of
despair
a
throng
of
the
revellers
at
once
threw
themselves
into
the
black
apartment
and
seizing
the
mummer
whose
tall
figure
stood
erect
and
motionless
within
the
shadow
of
the
ebony
clock
gasped
in
unutterable
horror
at
finding
the
grave
cerements
and
corpse-like
mask
which
they
handled
with
so
violent
a
rudeness
untenanted
by
any
tangible
form
and
now
was
acknowledged
the
presence
of
the
red
death
he
had
come
like
a
thief
in
the
night
and
one
by
one
dropped
the
revellers
in
the
blood-bedewed
halls
of
their
revel
and
died
each
in
the
despairing
posture
of
his
fall
and
the
life
of
the
ebony
clock
went
out
with
that
of
the
last
of
the
gay
and
the
