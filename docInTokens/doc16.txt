a
considerable
number
of
hunting
parties
were
out
that
year
without
finding
so
much
as
a
fresh
trail
for
the
moose
were
uncommonly
shy
and
the
various
nimrods
returned
to
the
bosoms
of
their
respective
families
with
the
best
excuses
the
facts
of
their
imaginations
could
suggest
dr
cathcart
among
others
came
back
without
a
trophy
but
he
brought
instead
the
memory
of
an
experience
which
he
declares
was
worth
all
the
bull
moose
that
had
ever
been
shot
but
then
cathcart
of
aberdeen
was
interested
in
other
things
besides
moose--amongst
them
the
vagaries
of
the
human
mind
this
particular
story
however
found
no
mention
in
his
book
on
collective
hallucination
for
the
simple
reason
so
he
confided
once
to
a
fellow
colleague
that
he
himself
played
too
intimate
a
part
in
it
to
form
a
competent
judgment
of
the
affair
as
a
whole
besides
himself
and
his
guide
hank
davis
there
was
young
simpson
his
nephew
a
divinity
student
destined
for
the
wee
kirk
then
on
his
first
visit
to
canadian
backwoods
and
the
latter's
guide
dã©fago
joseph
dã©fago
was
a
french
canuck
who
had
strayed
from
his
native
province
of
quebec
years
before
and
had
got
caught
in
rat
portage
when
the
canadian
pacific
railway
was
a-building
a
man
who
in
addition
to
his
unparalleled
knowledge
of
wood-craft
and
bush-lore
could
also
sing
the
old
voyageur
songs
and
tell
a
capital
hunting
yarn
into
the
bargain
he
was
deeply
susceptible
moreover
to
that
singular
spell
which
the
wilderness
lays
upon
certain
lonely
natures
and
he
loved
the
wild
solitudes
with
a
kind
of
romantic
passion
that
amounted
almost
to
an
obsession
the
life
of
the
backwoods
fascinated
him--whence
doubtless
his
surpassing
efficiency
in
dealing
with
their
mysteries
on
this
particular
expedition
he
was
hank's
choice
hank
knew
him
and
swore
by
him
he
also
swore
at
him
jest
as
a
pal
might
and
since
he
had
a
vocabulary
of
picturesque
if
utterly
meaningless
oaths
the
conversation
between
the
two
stalwart
and
hardy
woodsmen
was
often
of
a
rather
lively
description
this
river
of
expletives
however
hank
agreed
to
dam
a
little
out
of
respect
for
his
old
hunting
boss
dr
cathcart
whom
of
course
he
addressed
after
the
fashion
of
the
country
as
doc
and
also
because
he
understood
that
young
simpson
was
already
a
bit
of
a
parson
he
had
however
one
objection
to
dã©fago
and
one
only--which
was
that
the
french
canadian
sometimes
exhibited
what
hank
described
as
the
output
of
a
cursed
and
dismal
mind
meaning
apparently
that
he
sometimes
was
true
to
type
latin
type
and
suffered
fits
of
a
kind
of
silent
moroseness
when
nothing
could
induce
him
to
utter
speech
dã©fago
that
is
to
say
was
imaginative
and
melancholy
and
as
a
rule
it
was
too
long
a
spell
of
civilization
that
induced
the
attacks
for
a
few
days
of
the
wilderness
invariably
cured
them
this
then
was
the
party
of
four
that
found
themselves
in
camp
the
last
week
in
october
of
that
shy
moose
year
'way
up
in
the
wilderness
north
of
rat
portage--a
forsaken
and
desolate
country
there
was
also
punk
an
indian
who
had
accompanied
dr
cathcart
and
hank
on
their
hunting
trips
in
previous
years
and
who
acted
as
cook
his
duty
was
merely
to
stay
in
camp
catch
fish
and
prepare
venison
steaks
and
coffee
at
a
few
minutes'
notice
he
dressed
in
the
worn-out
clothes
bequeathed
to
him
by
former
patrons
and
except
for
his
coarse
black
hair
and
dark
skin
he
looked
in
these
city
garments
no
more
like
a
real
redskin
than
a
stage
negro
looks
like
a
real
african
for
all
that
however
punk
had
in
him
still
the
instincts
of
his
dying
race
his
taciturn
silence
and
his
endurance
survived
also
his
superstition
the
party
round
the
blazing
fire
that
night
were
despondent
for
a
week
had
passed
without
a
single
sign
of
recent
moose
discovering
itself
dã©fago
had
sung
his
song
and
plunged
into
a
story
but
hank
in
bad
humor
reminded
him
so
often
that
he
kep'
mussing-up
the
fac's
so
that
it
was
'most
all
nothin'
but
a
petered-out
lie
that
the
frenchman
had
finally
subsided
into
a
sulky
silence
which
nothing
seemed
likely
to
break
dr
cathcart
and
his
nephew
were
fairly
done
after
an
exhausting
day
punk
was
washing
up
the
dishes
grunting
to
himself
under
the
lean-to
of
branches
where
he
later
also
slept
no
one
troubled
to
stir
the
slowly
dying
fire
overhead
the
stars
were
brilliant
in
a
sky
quite
wintry
and
there
was
so
little
wind
that
ice
was
already
forming
stealthily
along
the
shores
of
the
still
lake
behind
them
the
silence
of
the
vast
listening
forest
stole
forward
and
enveloped
them
hank
broke
in
suddenly
with
his
nasal
voice
i'm
in
favor
of
breaking
new
ground
tomorrow
doc
he
observed
with
energy
looking
across
at
his
employer
we
don't
stand
a
dead
dago's
chance
around
here
agreed
said
cathcart
always
a
man
of
few
words
think
the
idea's
good
sure
pop
it's
good
hank
resumed
with
confidence
s'pose
now
you
and
i
strike
west
up
garden
lake
way
for
a
change
none
of
us
ain't
touched
that
quiet
bit
o'
land
yet--
i'm
with
you
and
you
dã©fago
take
mr
simpson
along
in
the
small
canoe
skip
across
the
lake
portage
over
into
fifty
island
water
and
take
a
good
squint
down
that
thar
southern
shore
the
moose
'yarded'
there
like
hell
last
year
and
for
all
we
know
they
may
be
doin'
it
agin
this
year
jest
to
spite
us
dã©fago
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
fire
said
nothing
by
way
of
reply
he
was
still
offended
possibly
about
his
interrupted
story
no
one's
been
up
that
way
this
year
an'
i'll
lay
my
bottom
dollar
on
that
hank
added
with
emphasis
as
though
he
had
a
reason
for
knowing
he
looked
over
at
his
partner
sharply
better
take
the
little
silk
tent
and
stay
away
a
couple
o'
nights
he
concluded
as
though
the
matter
were
definitely
settled
for
hank
was
recognized
as
general
organizer
of
the
hunt
and
in
charge
of
the
party
it
was
obvious
to
anyone
that
dã©fago
did
not
jump
at
the
plan
but
his
silence
seemed
to
convey
something
more
than
ordinary
disapproval
and
across
his
sensitive
dark
face
there
passed
a
curious
expression
like
a
flash
of
firelight--not
so
quickly
however
that
the
three
men
had
not
time
to
catch
it
he
funked
for
some
reason
i
thought
simpson
said
afterwards
in
the
tent
he
shared
with
his
uncle
dr
cathcart
made
no
immediate
reply
although
the
look
had
interested
him
enough
at
the
time
for
him
to
make
a
mental
note
of
it
the
expression
had
caused
him
a
passing
uneasiness
he
could
not
quite
account
for
at
the
moment
but
hank
of
course
had
been
the
first
to
notice
it
and
the
odd
thing
was
that
instead
of
becoming
explosive
or
angry
over
the
other's
reluctance
he
at
once
began
to
humor
him
a
bit
but
there
ain't
no
speshul
reason
why
no
one's
been
up
there
this
year
he
said
with
a
perceptible
hush
in
his
tone
not
the
reason
you
mean
anyway
las'
year
it
was
the
fires
that
kep'
folks
out
and
this
year
i
guess--i
guess
it
jest
happened
so
that's
all
his
manner
was
clearly
meant
to
be
encouraging
joseph
dã©fago
raised
his
eyes
a
moment
then
dropped
them
again
a
breath
of
wind
stole
out
of
the
forest
and
stirred
the
embers
into
a
passing
blaze
dr
cathcart
again
noticed
the
expression
in
the
guide's
face
and
again
he
did
not
like
it
but
this
time
the
nature
of
the
look
betrayed
itself
in
those
eyes
for
an
instant
he
caught
the
gleam
of
a
man
scared
in
his
very
soul
it
disquieted
him
more
than
he
cared
to
admit
bad
indians
up
that
way
he
asked
with
a
laugh
to
ease
matters
a
little
while
simpson
too
sleepy
to
notice
this
subtle
by-play
moved
off
to
bed
with
a
prodigious
yawn
or--or
anything
wrong
with
the
country
he
added
when
his
nephew
was
out
of
hearing
hank
met
his
eye
with
something
less
than
his
usual
frankness
he's
jest
skeered
he
replied
good-humouredly
skeered
stiff
about
some
ole
feery
tale
that's
all
ain't
it
ole
pard
and
he
gave
dã©fago
a
friendly
kick
on
the
moccasined
foot
that
lay
nearest
the
fire
dã©fago
looked
up
quickly
as
from
an
interrupted
reverie
a
reverie
however
that
had
not
prevented
his
seeing
all
that
went
on
about
him
skeered--nuthin'
he
answered
with
a
flush
of
defiance
there's
nuthin'
in
the
bush
that
can
skeer
joseph
dã©fago
and
don't
you
forget
it
and
the
natural
energy
with
which
he
spoke
made
it
impossible
to
know
whether
he
told
the
whole
truth
or
only
a
part
of
it
hank
turned
towards
the
doctor
he
was
just
going
to
add
something
when
he
stopped
abruptly
and
looked
round
a
sound
close
behind
them
in
the
darkness
made
all
three
start
it
was
old
punk
who
had
moved
up
from
his
lean-to
while
they
talked
and
now
stood
there
just
beyond
the
circle
of
firelight--listening
'nother
time
doc
hank
whispered
with
a
wink
when
the
gallery
ain't
stepped
down
into
the
stalls
and
springing
to
his
feet
he
slapped
the
indian
on
the
back
and
cried
noisily
come
up
t'
the
fire
an'
warm
yer
dirty
red
skin
a
bit
he
dragged
him
towards
the
blaze
and
threw
more
wood
on
that
was
a
mighty
good
feed
you
give
us
an
hour
or
two
back
he
continued
heartily
as
though
to
set
the
man's
thoughts
on
another
scent
and
it
ain't
christian
to
let
you
stand
out
there
freezin'
yer
ole
soul
to
hell
while
we're
gettin'
all
good
an'
toasted
punk
moved
in
and
warmed
his
feet
smiling
darkly
at
the
other's
volubility
which
he
only
half
understood
but
saying
nothing
and
presently
dr
cathcart
seeing
that
further
conversation
was
impossible
followed
his
nephew's
example
and
moved
off
to
the
tent
leaving
the
three
men
smoking
over
the
now
blazing
fire
it
is
not
easy
to
undress
in
a
small
tent
without
waking
one's
companion
and
cathcart
hardened
and
warm-blooded
as
he
was
in
spite
of
his
fifty
odd
years
did
what
hank
would
have
described
as
considerable
of
his
twilight
in
the
open
he
noticed
during
the
process
that
punk
had
meanwhile
gone
back
to
his
lean-to
and
that
hank
and
dã©fago
were
at
it
hammer
and
tongs
or
rather
hammer
and
anvil
the
little
french
canadian
being
the
anvil
it
was
all
very
like
the
conventional
stage
picture
of
western
melodrama
the
fire
lighting
up
their
faces
with
patches
of
alternate
red
and
black
dã©fago
in
slouch
hat
and
moccasins
in
the
part
of
the
badlands
villain
hank
open-faced
and
hatless
with
that
reckless
fling
of
his
shoulders
the
honest
and
deceived
hero
and
old
punk
eavesdropping
in
the
background
supplying
the
atmosphere
of
mystery
the
doctor
smiled
as
he
noticed
the
details
but
at
the
same
time
something
deep
within
him--he
hardly
knew
what--shrank
a
little
as
though
an
almost
imperceptible
breath
of
warning
had
touched
the
surface
of
his
soul
and
was
gone
again
before
he
could
seize
it
probably
it
was
traceable
to
that
scared
expression
he
had
seen
in
the
eyes
of
dã©fago
probably--for
this
hint
of
fugitive
emotion
otherwise
escaped
his
usually
so
keen
analysis
dã©fago
he
was
vaguely
aware
might
cause
trouble
somehow
he
was
not
as
steady
a
guide
as
hank
for
instance

further
than
that
he
could
not
get

he
watched
the
men
a
moment
longer
before
diving
into
the
stuffy
tent
where
simpson
already
slept
soundly
hank
he
saw
was
swearing
like
a
mad
african
in
a
new
york
nigger
saloon
but
it
was
the
swearing
of
affection
the
ridiculous
oaths
flew
freely
now
that
the
cause
of
their
obstruction
was
asleep
presently
he
put
his
arm
almost
tenderly
upon
his
comrade's
shoulder
and
they
moved
off
together
into
the
shadows
where
their
tent
stood
faintly
glimmering
punk
too
a
moment
later
followed
their
example
and
disappeared
between
his
odorous
blankets
in
the
opposite
direction
dr
cathcart
then
likewise
turned
in
weariness
and
sleep
still
fighting
in
his
mind
with
an
obscure
curiosity
to
know
what
it
was
that
had
scared
dã©fago
about
the
country
up
fifty
island
water
way--wondering
too
why
punk's
presence
had
prevented
the
completion
of
what
hank
had
to
say
then
sleep
overtook
him
he
would
know
tomorrow
hank
would
tell
him
the
story
while
they
trudged
after
the
elusive
moose
deep
silence
fell
about
the
little
camp
planted
there
so
audaciously
in
the
jaws
of
the
wilderness
the
lake
gleamed
like
a
sheet
of
black
glass
beneath
the
stars
the
cold
air
pricked
in
the
draughts
of
night
that
poured
their
silent
tide
from
the
depths
of
the
forest
with
messages
from
distant
ridges
and
from
lakes
just
beginning
to
freeze
there
lay
already
the
faint
bleak
odors
of
coming
winter
white
men
with
their
dull
scent
might
never
have
divined
them
the
fragrance
of
the
wood
fire
would
have
concealed
from
them
these
almost
electrical
hints
of
moss
and
bark
and
hardening
swamp
a
hundred
miles
away
even
hank
and
dã©fago
subtly
in
league
with
the
soul
of
the
woods
as
they
were
would
probably
have
spread
their
delicate
nostrils
in
vain
but
an
hour
later
when
all
slept
like
the
dead
old
punk
crept
from
his
blankets
and
went
down
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
like
a
shadow--silently
as
only
indian
blood
can
move
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
about
him
the
thick
darkness
rendered
sight
of
small
avail
but
like
the
animals
he
possessed
other
senses
that
darkness
could
not
mute
he
listened--then
sniffed
the
air
motionless
as
a
hemlock
stem
he
stood
there
after
five
minutes
again
he
lifted
his
head
and
sniffed
and
yet
once
again
a
tingling
of
the
wonderful
nerves
that
betrayed
itself
by
no
outer
sign
ran
through
him
as
he
tasted
the
keen
air
then
merging
his
figure
into
the
surrounding
blackness
in
a
way
that
only
wild
men
and
animals
understand
he
turned
still
moving
like
a
shadow
and
went
stealthily
back
to
his
lean-to
and
his
bed
and
soon
after
he
slept
the
change
of
wind
he
had
divined
stirred
gently
the
reflection
of
the
stars
within
the
lake
rising
among
the
far
ridges
of
the
country
beyond
fifty
island
water
it
came
from
the
direction
in
which
he
had
stared
and
it
passed
over
the
sleeping
camp
with
a
faint
and
sighing
murmur
through
the
tops
of
the
big
trees
that
was
almost
too
delicate
to
be
audible
with
it
down
the
desert
paths
of
night
though
too
faint
too
high
even
for
the
indian's
hair-like
nerves
there
passed
a
curious
thin
odor
strangely
disquieting
an
odor
of
something
that
seemed
unfamiliar--utterly
unknown
the
french
canadian
and
the
man
of
indian
blood
each
stirred
uneasily
in
his
sleep
just
about
this
time
though
neither
of
them
woke
then
the
ghost
of
that
unforgettably
strange
odor
passed
away
and
was
lost
among
the
leagues
of
tenantless
forest
beyond
ii
in
the
morning
the
camp
was
astir
before
the
sun
there
had
been
a
light
fall
of
snow
during
the
night
and
the
air
was
sharp
punk
had
done
his
duty
betimes
for
the
odors
of
coffee
and
fried
bacon
reached
every
tent
all
were
in
good
spirits
wind's
shifted
cried
hank
vigorously
watching
simpson
and
his
guide
already
loading
the
small
canoe
it's
across
the
lake--dead
right
for
you
fellers
and
the
snow'll
make
bully
trails
if
there's
any
moose
mussing
around
up
thar
they'll
not
get
so
much
as
a
tail-end
scent
of
you
with
the
wind
as
it
is
good
luck
monsieur
dã©fago
he
added
facetiously
giving
the
name
its
french
pronunciation
for
once
bonne
chance
dã©fago
returned
the
good
wishes
apparently
in
the
best
of
spirits
the
silent
mood
gone
before
eight
o'clock
old
punk
had
the
camp
to
himself
cathcart
and
hank
were
far
along
the
trail
that
led
westwards
while
the
canoe
that
carried
dã©fago
and
simpson
with
silk
tent
and
grub
for
two
days
was
already
a
dark
speck
bobbing
on
the
bosom
of
the
lake
going
due
east
the
wintry
sharpness
of
the
air
was
tempered
now
by
a
sun
that
topped
the
wooded
ridges
and
blazed
with
a
luxurious
warmth
upon
the
world
of
lake
and
forest
below
loons
flew
skimming
through
the
sparkling
spray
that
the
wind
lifted
divers
shook
their
dripping
heads
to
the
sun
and
popped
smartly
out
of
sight
again
and
as
far
as
eye
could
reach
rose
the
leagues
of
endless
crowding
bush
desolate
in
its
lonely
sweep
and
grandeur
untrodden
by
foot
of
man
and
stretching
its
mighty
and
unbroken
carpet
right
up
to
the
frozen
shores
of
hudson
bay
simpson
who
saw
it
all
for
the
first
time
as
he
paddled
hard
in
the
bows
of
the
dancing
canoe
was
enchanted
by
its
austere
beauty
his
heart
drank
in
the
sense
of
freedom
and
great
spaces
just
as
his
lungs
drank
in
the
cool
and
perfumed
wind
behind
him
in
the
stern
seat
singing
fragments
of
his
native
chanties
dã©fago
steered
the
craft
of
birch
bark
like
a
thing
of
life
answering
cheerfully
all
his
companion's
questions
both
were
gay
and
light-hearted
on
such
occasions
men
lose
the
superficial
worldly
distinctions
they
become
human
beings
working
together
for
a
common
end
simpson
the
employer
and
dã©fago
the
employed
among
these
primitive
forces
were
simply--two
men
the
guider
and
the
guided
superior
knowledge
of
course
assumed
control
and
the
younger
man
fell
without
a
second
thought
into
the
quasi-subordinate
position
he
never
dreamed
of
objecting
when
dã©fago
dropped
the
mr
and
addressed
him
as
say
simpson
or
simpson
boss
which
was
invariably
the
case
before
they
reached
the
farther
shore
after
a
stiff
paddle
of
twelve
miles
against
a
head
wind
he
only
laughed
and
liked
it
then
ceased
to
notice
it
at
all
for
this
divinity
student
was
a
young
man
of
parts
and
character
though
as
yet
of
course
untraveled
and
on
this
trip--the
first
time
he
had
seen
any
country
but
his
own
and
little
switzerland--the
huge
scale
of
things
somewhat
bewildered
him
it
was
one
thing
he
realized
to
hear
about
primeval
forests
but
quite
another
to
see
them
while
to
dwell
in
them
and
seek
acquaintance
with
their
wild
life
was
again
an
initiation
that
no
intelligent
man
could
undergo
without
a
certain
shifting
of
personal
values
hitherto
held
for
permanent
and
sacred
simpson
knew
the
first
faint
indication
of
this
emotion
when
he
held
the
new
303
rifle
in
his
hands
and
looked
along
its
pair
of
faultless
gleaming
barrels
the
three
days'
journey
to
their
headquarters
by
lake
and
portage
had
carried
the
process
a
stage
farther
and
now
that
he
was
about
to
plunge
beyond
even
the
fringe
of
wilderness
where
they
were
camped
into
the
virgin
heart
of
uninhabited
regions
as
vast
as
europe
itself
the
true
nature
of
the
situation
stole
upon
him
with
an
effect
of
delight
and
awe
that
his
imagination
was
fully
capable
of
appreciating
it
was
himself
and
dã©fago
against
a
multitude--at
least
against
a
titan
the
bleak
splendors
of
these
remote
and
lonely
forests
rather
overwhelmed
him
with
the
sense
of
his
own
littleness
that
stern
quality
of
the
tangled
backwoods
which
can
only
be
described
as
merciless
and
terrible
rose
out
of
these
far
blue
woods
swimming
upon
the
horizon
and
revealed
itself
he
understood
the
silent
warning
he
realized
his
own
utter
helplessness
only
dã©fago
as
a
symbol
of
a
distant
civilization
where
man
was
master
stood
between
him
and
a
pitiless
death
by
exhaustion
and
starvation
it
was
thrilling
to
him
therefore
to
watch
dã©fago
turn
over
the
canoe
upon
the
shore
pack
the
paddles
carefully
underneath
and
then
proceed
to
blaze
the
spruce
stems
for
some
distance
on
either
side
of
an
almost
invisible
trail
with
the
careless
remark
thrown
in
say
simpson
if
anything
happens
to
me
you'll
find
the
canoe
all
correc'
by
these
marks--then
strike
doo
west
into
the
sun
to
hit
the
home
camp
agin
see
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
say
and
he
said
it
without
any
noticeable
inflexion
of
the
voice
only
it
happened
to
express
the
youth's
emotions
at
the
moment
with
an
utterance
that
was
symbolic
of
the
situation
and
of
his
own
helplessness
as
a
factor
in
it
he
was
alone
with
dã©fago
in
a
primitive
world
that
was
all
the
canoe
another
symbol
of
man's
ascendancy
was
now
to
be
left
behind
those
small
yellow
patches
made
on
the
trees
by
the
axe
were
the
only
indications
of
its
hiding
place
meanwhile
shouldering
the
packs
between
them
each
man
carrying
his
own
rifle
they
followed
the
slender
trail
over
rocks
and
fallen
trunks
and
across
half-frozen
swamps
skirting
numerous
lakes
that
fairly
gemmed
the
forest
their
borders
fringed
with
mist
and
towards
five
o'clock
found
themselves
suddenly
on
the
edge
of
the
woods
looking
out
across
a
large
sheet
of
water
in
front
of
them
dotted
with
pine-clad
islands
of
all
describable
shapes
and
sizes
fifty
island
water
announced
dã©fago
wearily
and
the
sun
jest
goin'
to
dip
his
bald
old
head
into
it
he
added
with
unconscious
poetry
and
immediately
they
set
about
pitching
camp
for
the
night
in
a
very
few
minutes
under
those
skilful
hands
that
never
made
a
movement
too
much
or
a
movement
too
little
the
silk
tent
stood
taut
and
cozy
the
beds
of
balsam
boughs
ready
laid
and
a
brisk
cooking
fire
burned
with
the
minimum
of
smoke
while
the
young
scotchman
cleaned
the
fish
they
had
caught
trolling
behind
the
canoe
dã©fago
guessed
he
would
jest
as
soon
take
a
turn
through
the
bush
for
indications
of
moose
may
come
across
a
trunk
where
they
bin
and
rubbed
horns
he
said
as
he
moved
off
or
feedin'
on
the
last
of
the
maple
leaves--and
he
was
gone
his
small
figure
melted
away
like
a
shadow
in
the
dusk
while
simpson
noted
with
a
kind
of
admiration
how
easily
the
forest
absorbed
him
into
herself
a
few
steps
it
seemed
and
he
was
no
longer
visible
yet
there
was
little
underbrush
hereabouts
the
trees
stood
somewhat
apart
well
spaced
and
in
the
clearings
grew
silver
birch
and
maple
spearlike
and
slender
against
the
immense
stems
of
spruce
and
hemlock
but
for
occasional
prostrate
monsters
and
the
boulders
of
grey
rock
that
thrust
uncouth
shoulders
here
and
there
out
of
the
ground
it
might
well
have
been
a
bit
of
park
in
the
old
country
almost
one
might
have
seen
in
it
the
hand
of
man
a
little
to
the
right
however
began
the
great
burnt
section
miles
in
extent
proclaiming
its
real
character--brulã©
as
it
is
called
where
the
fires
of
the
previous
year
had
raged
for
weeks
and
the
blackened
stumps
now
rose
gaunt
and
ugly
bereft
of
branches
like
gigantic
match
heads
stuck
into
the
ground
savage
and
desolate
beyond
words
the
perfume
of
charcoal
and
rain-soaked
ashes
still
hung
faintly
about
it
the
dusk
rapidly
deepened
the
glades
grew
dark
the
crackling
of
the
fire
and
the
wash
of
little
waves
along
the
rocky
lake
shore
were
the
only
sounds
audible
the
wind
had
dropped
with
the
sun
and
in
all
that
vast
world
of
branches
nothing
stirred
any
moment
it
seemed
the
woodland
gods
who
are
to
be
worshipped
in
silence
and
loneliness
might
stretch
their
mighty
and
terrific
outlines
among
the
trees
in
front
through
doorways
pillared
by
huge
straight
stems
lay
the
stretch
of
fifty
island
water
a
crescent-shaped
lake
some
fifteen
miles
from
tip
to
tip
and
perhaps
five
miles
across
where
they
were
camped
a
sky
of
rose
and
saffron
more
clear
than
any
atmosphere
simpson
had
ever
known
still
dropped
its
pale
streaming
fires
across
the
waves
where
the
islands--a
hundred
surely
rather
than
fifty--floated
like
the
fairy
barques
of
some
enchanted
fleet
fringed
with
pines
whose
crests
fingered
most
delicately
the
sky
they
almost
seemed
to
move
upwards
as
the
light
faded--about
to
weigh
anchor
and
navigate
the
pathways
of
the
heavens
instead
of
the
currents
of
their
native
and
desolate
lake
and
strips
of
colored
cloud
like
flaunting
pennons
signaled
their
departure
to
the
stars
the
beauty
of
the
scene
was
strangely
uplifting
simpson
smoked
the
fish
and
burnt
his
fingers
into
the
bargain
in
his
efforts
to
enjoy
it
and
at
the
same
time
tend
the
frying
pan
and
the
fire
yet
ever
at
the
back
of
his
thoughts
lay
that
other
aspect
of
the
wilderness
the
indifference
to
human
life
the
merciless
spirit
of
desolation
which
took
no
note
of
man
the
sense
of
his
utter
loneliness
now
that
even
dã©fago
had
gone
came
close
as
he
looked
about
him
and
listened
for
the
sound
of
his
companion's
returning
footsteps
there
was
pleasure
in
the
sensation
yet
with
it
a
perfectly
comprehensible
alarm
and
instinctively
the
thought
stirred
in
him
what
should
i--could
i
do--if
anything
happened
and
he
did
not
come
back--
they
enjoyed
their
well-earned
supper
eating
untold
quantities
of
fish
and
drinking
unmilked
tea
strong
enough
to
kill
men
who
had
not
covered
thirty
miles
of
hard
going
eating
little
on
the
way
and
when
it
was
over
they
smoked
and
told
stories
round
the
blazing
fire
laughing
stretching
weary
limbs
and
discussing
plans
for
the
morrow
dã©fago
was
in
excellent
spirits
though
disappointed
at
having
no
signs
of
moose
to
report
but
it
was
dark
and
he
had
not
gone
far
the
brulã©
too
was
bad
his
clothes
and
hands
were
smeared
with
charcoal
simpson
watching
him
realized
with
renewed
vividness
their
position--alone
together
in
the
wilderness
dã©fago
he
said
presently
these
woods
you
know
are
a
bit
too
big
to
feel
quite
at
home
in--to
feel
comfortable
in
i
mean
eh
he
merely
gave
expression
to
the
mood
of
the
moment
he
was
hardly
prepared
for
the
earnestness
the
solemnity
even
with
which
the
guide
took
him
up
you've
hit
it
right
simpson
boss
he
replied
fixing
his
searching
brown
eyes
on
his
face
and
that's
the
truth
sure
there's
no
end
to
'em--no
end
at
all
then
he
added
in
a
lowered
tone
as
if
to
himself
there's
lots
found
out
that
and
gone
plumb
to
pieces
but
the
man's
gravity
of
manner
was
not
quite
to
the
other's
liking
it
was
a
little
too
suggestive
for
this
scenery
and
setting
he
was
sorry
he
had
broached
the
subject
he
remembered
suddenly
how
his
uncle
had
told
him
that
men
were
sometimes
stricken
with
a
strange
fever
of
the
wilderness
when
the
seduction
of
the
uninhabited
wastes
caught
them
so
fiercely
that
they
went
forth
half
fascinated
half
deluded
to
their
death
and
he
had
a
shrewd
idea
that
his
companion
held
something
in
sympathy
with
that
queer
type
he
led
the
conversation
on
to
other
topics
on
to
hank
and
the
doctor
for
instance
and
the
natural
rivalry
as
to
who
should
get
the
first
sight
of
moose
if
they
went
doo
west
observed
dã©fago
carelessly
there's
sixty
miles
between
us
now--with
ole
punk
at
halfway
house
eatin'
himself
full
to
bustin'
with
fish
and
coffee
they
laughed
together
over
the
picture
but
the
casual
mention
of
those
sixty
miles
again
made
simpson
realize
the
prodigious
scale
of
this
land
where
they
hunted
sixty
miles
was
a
mere
step
two
hundred
little
more
than
a
step
stories
of
lost
hunters
rose
persistently
before
his
memory
the
passion
and
mystery
of
homeless
and
wandering
men
seduced
by
the
beauty
of
great
forests
swept
his
soul
in
a
way
too
vivid
to
be
quite
pleasant
he
wondered
vaguely
whether
it
was
the
mood
of
his
companion
that
invited
the
unwelcome
suggestion
with
such
persistence
sing
us
a
song
dã©fago
if
you're
not
too
tired
he
asked
one
of
those
old
voyageur
songs
you
sang
the
other
night
he
handed
his
tobacco
pouch
to
the
guide
and
then
filled
his
own
pipe
while
the
canadian
nothing
loth
sent
his
light
voice
across
the
lake
in
one
of
those
plaintive
almost
melancholy
chanties
with
which
lumbermen
and
trappers
lessen
the
burden
of
their
labor
there
was
an
appealing
and
romantic
flavor
about
it
something
that
recalled
the
atmosphere
of
the
old
pioneer
days
when
indians
and
wilderness
were
leagued
together
battles
frequent
and
the
old
country
farther
off
than
it
is
today
the
sound
traveled
pleasantly
over
the
water
but
the
forest
at
their
backs
seemed
to
swallow
it
down
with
a
single
gulp
that
permitted
neither
echo
nor
resonance
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
third
verse
that
simpson
noticed
something
unusual--something
that
brought
his
thoughts
back
with
a
rush
from
faraway
scenes
a
curious
change
had
come
into
the
man's
voice
even
before
he
knew
what
it
was
uneasiness
caught
him
and
looking
up
quickly
he
saw
that
dã©fago
though
still
singing
was
peering
about
him
into
the
bush
as
though
he
heard
or
saw
something
his
voice
grew
fainter--dropped
to
a
hush--then
ceased
altogether
the
same
instant
with
a
movement
amazingly
alert
he
started
to
his
feet
and
stood
upright--sniffing
the
air
like
a
dog
scenting
game
he
drew
the
air
into
his
nostrils
in
short
sharp
breaths
turning
quickly
as
he
did
so
in
all
directions
and
finally
pointing
down
the
lake
shore
eastwards
it
was
a
performance
unpleasantly
suggestive
and
at
the
same
time
singularly
dramatic
simpson's
heart
fluttered
disagreeably
as
he
watched
it
lord
man
how
you
made
me
jump
he
exclaimed
on
his
feet
beside
him
the
same
instant
and
peering
over
his
shoulder
into
the
sea
of
darkness
what's
up
are
you
frightened--
even
before
the
question
was
out
of
his
mouth
he
knew
it
was
foolish
for
any
man
with
a
pair
of
eyes
in
his
head
could
see
that
the
canadian
had
turned
white
down
to
his
very
gills
not
even
sunburn
and
the
glare
of
the
fire
could
hide
that
the
student
felt
himself
trembling
a
little
weakish
in
the
knees
what's
up
he
repeated
quickly
d'you
smell
moose
or
anything
queer
anything--wrong
he
lowered
his
voice
instinctively
the
forest
pressed
round
them
with
its
encircling
wall
the
nearer
tree
stems
gleamed
like
bronze
in
the
firelight
beyond
that--blackness
and
so
far
as
he
could
tell
a
silence
of
death
just
behind
them
a
passing
puff
of
wind
lifted
a
single
leaf
looked
at
it
then
laid
it
softly
down
again
without
disturbing
the
rest
of
the
covey
it
seemed
as
if
a
million
invisible
causes
had
combined
just
to
produce
that
single
visible
effect
other
life
pulsed
about
them--and
was
gone
dã©fago
turned
abruptly
the
livid
hue
of
his
face
had
turned
to
a
dirty
grey
i
never
said
i
heered--or
smelt--nuthin'
he
said
slowly
and
emphatically
in
an
oddly
altered
voice
that
conveyed
somehow
a
touch
of
defiance
i
was
only--takin'
a
look
round--so
to
speak
it's
always
a
mistake
to
be
too
previous
with
yer
questions
then
he
added
suddenly
with
obvious
effort
in
his
more
natural
voice
have
you
got
the
matches
boss
simpson
and
proceeded
to
light
the
pipe
he
had
half
filled
just
before
he
began
to
sing
without
speaking
another
word
they
sat
down
again
by
the
fire
dã©fago
changing
his
side
so
that
he
could
face
the
direction
the
wind
came
from
for
even
a
tenderfoot
could
tell
that
dã©fago
changed
his
position
in
order
to
hear
and
smell--all
there
was
to
be
heard
and
smelt
and
since
he
now
faced
the
lake
with
his
back
to
the
trees
it
was
evidently
nothing
in
the
forest
that
had
sent
so
strange
and
sudden
a
warning
to
his
marvelously
trained
nerves
guess
now
i
don't
feel
like
singing
any
he
explained
presently
of
his
own
accord
that
song
kinder
brings
back
memories
that's
troublesome
to
me
i
never
oughter've
begun
it
it
sets
me
on
t'
imagining
things
see
clearly
the
man
was
still
fighting
with
some
profoundly
moving
emotion
he
wished
to
excuse
himself
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
but
the
explanation
in
that
it
was
only
a
part
of
the
truth
was
a
lie
and
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
simpson
was
not
deceived
by
it
for
nothing
could
explain
away
the
livid
terror
that
had
dropped
over
his
face
while
he
stood
there
sniffing
the
air
and
nothing--no
amount
of
blazing
fire
or
chatting
on
ordinary
subjects--could
make
that
camp
exactly
as
it
had
been
before
the
shadow
of
an
unknown
horror
naked
if
unguessed
that
had
flashed
for
an
instant
in
the
face
and
gestures
of
the
guide
had
also
communicated
itself
vaguely
and
therefore
more
potently
to
his
companion
the
guide's
visible
efforts
to
dissemble
the
truth
only
made
things
worse
moreover
to
add
to
the
younger
man's
uneasiness
was
the
difficulty
nay
the
impossibility
he
felt
of
asking
questions
and
also
his
complete
ignorance
as
to
the
cause
indians
wild
animals
forest
fires--all
these
he
knew
were
wholly
out
of
the
question
his
imagination
searched
vigorously
but
in
vain





yet
somehow
or
other
after
another
long
spell
of
smoking
talking
and
roasting
themselves
before
the
great
fire
the
shadow
that
had
so
suddenly
invaded
their
peaceful
camp
began
to
shift
perhaps
dã©fago's
efforts
or
the
return
of
his
quiet
and
normal
attitude
accomplished
this
perhaps
simpson
himself
had
exaggerated
the
affair
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
truth
or
possibly
the
vigorous
air
of
the
wilderness
brought
its
own
powers
of
healing
whatever
the
cause
the
feeling
of
immediate
horror
seemed
to
have
passed
away
as
mysteriously
as
it
had
come
for
nothing
occurred
to
feed
it
simpson
began
to
feel
that
he
had
permitted
himself
the
unreasoning
terror
of
a
child
he
put
it
down
partly
to
a
certain
subconscious
excitement
that
this
wild
and
immense
scenery
generated
in
his
blood
partly
to
the
spell
of
solitude
and
partly
to
overfatigue
that
pallor
in
the
guide's
face
was
of
course
uncommonly
hard
to
explain
yet
it
might
have
been
due
in
some
way
to
an
effect
of
firelight
or
his
own
imagination
he
gave
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
he
was
scotch
when
a
somewhat
unordinary
emotion
has
disappeared
the
mind
always
finds
a
dozen
ways
of
explaining
away
its
causes
simpson
lit
a
last
pipe
and
tried
to
laugh
to
himself
on
getting
home
to
scotland
it
would
make
quite
a
good
story
he
did
not
realize
that
this
laughter
was
a
sign
that
terror
still
lurked
in
the
recesses
of
his
soul--that
in
fact
it
was
merely
one
of
the
conventional
signs
by
which
a
man
seriously
alarmed
tries
to
persuade
himself
that
he
is
not
so
dã©fago
however
heard
that
low
laughter
and
looked
up
with
surprise
on
his
face
the
two
men
stood
side
by
side
kicking
the
embers
about
before
going
to
bed
it
was
ten
o'clock--a
late
hour
for
hunters
to
be
still
awake
what's
ticklin'
yer
he
asked
in
his
ordinary
tone
yet
gravely
i--i
was
thinking
of
our
little
toy
woods
at
home
just
at
that
moment
stammered
simpson
coming
back
to
what
really
dominated
his
mind
and
startled
by
the
question
and
comparing
them
to--to
all
this
and
he
swept
his
arm
round
to
indicate
the
bush
a
pause
followed
in
which
neither
of
them
said
anything
all
the
same
i
wouldn't
laugh
about
it
if
i
was
you
dã©fago
added
looking
over
simpson's
shoulder
into
the
shadows
there's
places
in
there
nobody
won't
never
see
into--nobody
knows
what
lives
in
there
either
too
big--too
far
off
the
suggestion
in
the
guide's
manner
was
immense
and
horrible
dã©fago
nodded
the
expression
on
his
face
was
dark
he
too
felt
uneasy
the
younger
man
understood
that
in
a
hinterland
of
this
size
there
might
well
be
depths
of
wood
that
would
never
in
the
life
of
the
world
be
known
or
trodden
the
thought
was
not
exactly
the
sort
he
welcomed
in
a
loud
voice
cheerfully
he
suggested
that
it
was
time
for
bed
but
the
guide
lingered
tinkering
with
the
fire
arranging
the
stones
needlessly
doing
a
dozen
things
that
did
not
really
need
doing
evidently
there
was
something
he
wanted
to
say
yet
found
it
difficult
to
get
at
say
you
boss
simpson
he
began
suddenly
as
the
last
shower
of
sparks
went
up
into
the
air
you
don't--smell
nothing
do
you--nothing
pertickler
i
mean
the
commonplace
question
simpson
realized
veiled
a
dreadfully
serious
thought
in
his
mind
a
shiver
ran
down
his
back
nothing
but
burning
wood
he
replied
firmly
kicking
again
at
the
embers
the
sound
of
his
own
foot
made
him
start
and
all
the
evenin'
you
ain't
smelt--nothing
persisted
the
guide
peering
at
him
through
the
gloom
nothing
extrordiny
and
different
to
anything
else
you
ever
smelt
before
no
no
man
nothing
at
all
he
replied
aggressively
half
angrily
dã©fago's
face
cleared
that's
good
he
exclaimed
with
evident
relief
that's
good
to
hear
have
you
asked
simpson
sharply
and
the
same
instant
regretted
the
question
the
canadian
came
closer
in
the
darkness
he
shook
his
head
i
guess
not
he
said
though
without
overwhelming
conviction
it
must've
been
just
that
song
of
mine
that
did
it
it's
the
song
they
sing
in
lumber
camps
and
godforsaken
places
like
that
when
they're
skeered
the
wendigo's
somewhere
around
doin'
a
bit
of
swift
traveling--
and
what's
the
wendigo
pray
simpson
asked
quickly
irritated
because
again
he
could
not
prevent
that
sudden
shiver
of
the
nerves
he
knew
that
he
was
close
upon
the
man's
terror
and
the
cause
of
it
yet
a
rushing
passionate
curiosity
overcame
his
better
judgment
and
his
fear
dã©fago
turned
swiftly
and
looked
at
him
as
though
he
were
suddenly
about
to
shriek
his
eyes
shone
but
his
mouth
was
wide
open
yet
all
he
said
or
whispered
rather
for
his
voice
sank
very
low
was
it's
nuthin'--nuthin'
but
what
those
lousy
fellers
believe
when
they've
bin
hittin'
the
bottle
too
long--a
sort
of
great
animal
that
lives
up
yonder
he
jerked
his
head
northwards
quick
as
lightning
in
its
tracks
an'
bigger'n
anything
else
in
the
bush
an'
ain't
supposed
to
be
very
good
to
look
at--that's
all
a
backwoods
superstition--
began
simpson
moving
hastily
toward
the
tent
in
order
to
shake
off
the
hand
of
the
guide
that
clutched
his
arm
come
come
hurry
up
for
god's
sake
and
get
the
lantern
going
it's
time
we
were
in
bed
and
asleep
if
we're
going
to
be
up
with
the
sun
tomorrow
the
guide
was
close
on
his
heels
i'm
coming
he
answered
out
of
the
darkness
i'm
coming
and
after
a
slight
delay
he
appeared
with
the
lantern
and
hung
it
from
a
nail
in
the
front
pole
of
the
tent
the
shadows
of
a
hundred
trees
shifted
their
places
quickly
as
he
did
so
and
when
he
stumbled
over
the
rope
diving
swiftly
inside
the
whole
tent
trembled
as
though
a
gust
of
wind
struck
it
the
two
men
lay
down
without
undressing
upon
their
beds
of
soft
balsam
boughs
cunningly
arranged
inside
all
was
warm
and
cozy
but
outside
the
world
of
crowding
trees
pressed
close
about
them
marshalling
their
million
shadows
and
smothering
the
little
tent
that
stood
there
like
a
wee
white
shell
facing
the
ocean
of
tremendous
forest
between
the
two
lonely
figures
within
however
there
pressed
another
shadow
that
was
not
a
shadow
from
the
night
it
was
the
shadow
cast
by
the
strange
fear
never
wholly
exorcised
that
had
leaped
suddenly
upon
dã©fago
in
the
middle
of
his
singing
and
simpson
as
he
lay
there
watching
the
darkness
through
the
open
flap
of
the
tent
ready
to
plunge
into
the
fragrant
abyss
of
sleep
knew
first
that
unique
and
profound
stillness
of
a
primeval
forest
when
no
wind
stirs

and
when
the
night
has
weight
and
substance
that
enters
into
the
soul
to
bind
a
veil
about
it
then
sleep
took
him
iii
thus
it
seemed
to
him
at
least
yet
it
was
true
that
the
lap
of
the
water
just
beyond
the
tent
door
still
beat
time
with
his
lessening
pulses
when
he
realized
that
he
was
lying
with
his
eyes
open
and
that
another
sound
had
recently
introduced
itself
with
cunning
softness
between
the
splash
and
murmur
of
the
little
waves
and
long
before
he
understood
what
this
sound
was
it
had
stirred
in
him
the
centers
of
pity
and
alarm
he
listened
intently
though
at
first
in
vain
for
the
running
blood
beat
all
its
drums
too
noisily
in
his
ears
did
it
come
he
wondered
from
the
lake
or
from
the
woods
then
suddenly
with
a
rush
and
a
flutter
of
the
heart
he
knew
that
it
was
close
beside
him
in
the
tent
and
when
he
turned
over
for
a
better
hearing
it
focused
itself
unmistakably
not
two
feet
away
it
was
a
sound
of
weeping
dã©fago
upon
his
bed
of
branches
was
sobbing
in
the
darkness
as
though
his
heart
would
break
the
blankets
evidently
stuffed
against
his
mouth
to
stifle
it
and
his
first
feeling
before
he
could
think
or
reflect
was
the
rush
of
a
poignant
and
searching
tenderness
this
intimate
human
sound
heard
amid
the
desolation
about
them
woke
pity
it
was
so
incongruous
so
pitifully
incongruous--and
so
vain
tears--in
this
vast
and
cruel
wilderness
of
what
avail
he
thought
of
a
little
child
crying
in
mid-atlantic
then
of
course
with
fuller
realization
and
the
memory
of
what
had
gone
before
came
the
descent
of
the
terror
upon
him
and
his
blood
ran
cold
dã©fago
he
whispered
quickly
what's
the
matter
he
tried
to
make
his
voice
very
gentle
are
you
in
pain--unhappy--
there
was
no
reply
but
the
sounds
ceased
abruptly
he
stretched
his
hand
out
and
touched
him
the
body
did
not
stir
are
you
awake
for
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
man
was
crying
in
his
sleep
are
you
cold
he
noticed
that
his
feet
which
were
uncovered
projected
beyond
the
mouth
of
the
tent
he
spread
an
extra
fold
of
his
own
blankets
over
them
the
guide
had
slipped
down
in
his
bed
and
the
branches
seemed
to
have
been
dragged
with
him
he
was
afraid
to
pull
the
body
back
again
for
fear
of
waking
him
one
or
two
tentative
questions
he
ventured
softly
but
though
he
waited
for
several
minutes
there
came
no
reply
nor
any
sign
of
movement
presently
he
heard
his
regular
and
quiet
breathing
and
putting
his
hand
again
gently
on
the
breast
felt
the
steady
rise
and
fall
beneath
let
me
know
if
anything's
wrong
he
whispered
or
if
i
can
do
anything
wake
me
at
once
if
you
feel--queer
he
hardly
knew
what
to
say
he
lay
down
again
thinking
and
wondering
what
it
all
meant
dã©fago
of
course
had
been
crying
in
his
sleep
some
dream
or
other
had
afflicted
him
yet
never
in
his
life
would
he
forget
that
pitiful
sound
of
sobbing
and
the
feeling
that
the
whole
awful
wilderness
of
woods
listened
his
own
mind
busied
itself
for
a
long
time
with
the
recent
events
of
which
this
took
its
mysterious
place
as
one
and
though
his
reason
successfully
argued
away
all
unwelcome
suggestions
a
sensation
of
uneasiness
remained
resisting
ejection
very
deep-seated--peculiar
beyond
ordinary
iv
but
sleep
in
the
long
run
proves
greater
than
all
emotions
his
thoughts
soon
wandered
again
he
lay
there
warm
as
toast
exceedingly
weary
the
night
soothed
and
comforted
blunting
the
edges
of
memory
and
alarm
half
an
hour
later
he
was
oblivious
of
everything
in
the
outer
world
about
him
yet
sleep
in
this
case
was
his
great
enemy
concealing
all
approaches
smothering
the
warning
of
his
nerves
as
sometimes
in
a
nightmare
events
crowd
upon
each
other's
heels
with
a
conviction
of
dreadfulest
reality
yet
some
inconsistent
detail
accuses
the
whole
display
of
incompleteness
and
disguise
so
the
events
that
now
followed
though
they
actually
happened
persuaded
the
mind
somehow
that
the
detail
which
could
explain
them
had
been
overlooked
in
the
confusion
and
that
therefore
they
were
but
partly
true
the
rest
delusion
at
the
back
of
the
sleeper's
mind
something
remains
awake
ready
to
let
slip
the
judgment
all
this
is
not
quite
real
when
you
wake
up
you'll
understand
and
thus
in
a
way
it
was
with
simpson
the
events
not
wholly
inexplicable
or
incredible
in
themselves
yet
remain
for
the
man
who
saw
and
heard
them
a
sequence
of
separate
facts
of
cold
horror
because
the
little
piece
that
might
have
made
the
puzzle
clear
lay
concealed
or
overlooked
so
far
as
he
can
recall
it
was
a
violent
movement
running
downwards
through
the
tent
towards
the
door
that
first
woke
him
and
made
him
aware
that
his
companion
was
sitting
bolt
upright
beside
him--quivering
hours
must
have
passed
for
it
was
the
pale
gleam
of
the
dawn
that
revealed
his
outline
against
the
canvas
this
time
the
man
was
not
crying
he
was
quaking
like
a
leaf
the
trembling
he
felt
plainly
through
the
blankets
down
the
entire
length
of
his
own
body
dã©fago
had
huddled
down
against
him
for
protection
shrinking
away
from
something
that
apparently
concealed
itself
near
the
door
flaps
of
the
little
tent
simpson
thereupon
called
out
in
a
loud
voice
some
question
or
other--in
the
first
bewilderment
of
waking
he
does
not
remember
exactly
what--and
the
man
made
no
reply
the
atmosphere
and
feeling
of
true
nightmare
lay
horribly
about
him
making
movement
and
speech
both
difficult
at
first
indeed
he
was
not
sure
where
he
was--whether
in
one
of
the
earlier
camps
or
at
home
in
his
bed
at
aberdeen
the
sense
of
confusion
was
very
troubling
and
next--almost
simultaneous
with
his
waking
it
seemed--the
profound
stillness
of
the
dawn
outside
was
shattered
by
a
most
uncommon
sound
it
came
without
warning
or
audible
approach
and
it
was
unspeakably
dreadful
it
was
a
voice
simpson
declares
possibly
a
human
voice
hoarse
yet
plaintive--a
soft
roaring
voice
close
outside
the
tent
overhead
rather
than
upon
the
ground
of
immense
volume
while
in
some
strange
way
most
penetratingly
and
seductively
sweet
it
rang
out
too
in
three
separate
and
distinct
notes
or
cries
that
bore
in
some
odd
fashion
a
resemblance
farfetched
yet
recognizable
to
the
name
of
the
guide
dã©-fa-go
the
student
admits
he
is
unable
to
describe
it
quite
intelligently
for
it
was
unlike
any
sound
he
had
ever
heard
in
his
life
and
combined
a
blending
of
such
contrary
qualities
a
sort
of
windy
crying
voice
he
calls
it
as
of
something
lonely
and
untamed
wild
and
of
abominable
power
and
even
before
it
ceased
dropping
back
into
the
great
gulfs
of
silence
the
guide
beside
him
had
sprung
to
his
feet
with
an
answering
though
unintelligible
cry
he
blundered
against
the
tent
pole
with
violence
shaking
the
whole
structure
spreading
his
arms
out
frantically
for
more
room
and
kicking
his
legs
impetuously
free
of
the
clinging
blankets
for
a
second
perhaps
two
he
stood
upright
by
the
door
his
outline
dark
against
the
pallor
of
the
dawn
then
with
a
furious
rushing
speed
before
his
companion
could
move
a
hand
to
stop
him
he
shot
with
a
plunge
through
the
flaps
of
canvas--and
was
gone
and
as
he
went--so
astonishingly
fast
that
the
voice
could
actually
be
heard
dying
in
the
distance--he
called
aloud
in
tones
of
anguished
terror
that
at
the
same
time
held
something
strangely
like
the
frenzied
exultation
of
delight--
oh
oh
my
feet
of
fire
my
burning
feet
of
fire
oh
oh
this
height
and
fiery
speed
and
then
the
distance
quickly
buried
it
and
the
deep
silence
of
very
early
morning
descended
upon
the
forest
as
before
it
had
all
come
about
with
such
rapidity
that
but
for
the
evidence
of
the
empty
bed
beside
him
simpson
could
almost
have
believed
it
to
have
been
the
memory
of
a
nightmare
carried
over
from
sleep
he
still
felt
the
warm
pressure
of
that
vanished
body
against
his
side
there
lay
the
twisted
blankets
in
a
heap
the
very
tent
yet
trembled
with
the
vehemence
of
the
impetuous
departure
the
strange
words
rang
in
his
ears
as
though
he
still
heard
them
in
the
distance--wild
language
of
a
suddenly
stricken
mind
moreover
it
was
not
only
the
senses
of
sight
and
hearing
that
reported
uncommon
things
to
his
brain
for
even
while
the
man
cried
and
ran
he
had
become
aware
that
a
strange
perfume
faint
yet
pungent
pervaded
the
interior
of
the
tent
and
it
was
at
this
point
it
seems
brought
to
himself
by
the
consciousness
that
his
nostrils
were
taking
this
distressing
odor
down
into
his
throat
that
he
found
his
courage
sprang
quickly
to
his
feet--and
went
out
the
grey
light
of
dawn
that
dropped
cold
and
glimmering
between
the
trees
revealed
the
scene
tolerably
well
there
stood
the
tent
behind
him
soaked
with
dew
the
dark
ashes
of
the
fire
still
warm
the
lake
white
beneath
a
coating
of
mist
the
islands
rising
darkly
out
of
it
like
objects
packed
in
wool
and
patches
of
snow
beyond
among
the
clearer
spaces
of
the
bush--everything
cold
still
waiting
for
the
sun
but
nowhere
a
sign
of
the
vanished
guide--still
doubtless
flying
at
frantic
speed
through
the
frozen
woods
there
was
not
even
the
sound
of
disappearing
footsteps
nor
the
echoes
of
the
dying
voice
he
had
gone--utterly
there
was
nothing
nothing
but
the
sense
of
his
recent
presence
so
strongly
left
behind
about
the
camp
and--this
penetrating
all-pervading
odor
and
even
this
was
now
rapidly
disappearing
in
its
turn
in
spite
of
his
exceeding
mental
perturbation
simpson
struggled
hard
to
detect
its
nature
and
define
it
but
the
ascertaining
of
an
elusive
scent
not
recognized
subconsciously
and
at
once
is
a
very
subtle
operation
of
the
mind
and
he
failed
it
was
gone
before
he
could
properly
seize
or
name
it
approximate
description
even
seems
to
have
been
difficult
for
it
was
unlike
any
smell
he
knew
acrid
rather
not
unlike
the
odor
of
a
lion
he
thinks
yet
softer
and
not
wholly
unpleasing
with
something
almost
sweet
in
it
that
reminded
him
of
the
scent
of
decaying
garden
leaves
earth
and
the
myriad
nameless
perfumes
that
make
up
the
odor
of
a
big
forest
yet
the
odor
of
lions
is
the
phrase
with
which
he
usually
sums
it
all
up
then--it
was
wholly
gone
and
he
found
himself
standing
by
the
ashes
of
the
fire
in
a
state
of
amazement
and
stupid
terror
that
left
him
the
helpless
prey
of
anything
that
chose
to
happen
had
a
muskrat
poked
its
pointed
muzzle
over
a
rock
or
a
squirrel
scuttled
in
that
instant
down
the
bark
of
a
tree
he
would
most
likely
have
collapsed
without
more
ado
and
fainted
for
he
felt
about
the
whole
affair
the
touch
somewhere
of
a
great
outer
horror

and
his
scattered
powers
had
not
as
yet
had
time
to
collect
themselves
into
a
definite
attitude
of
fighting
self-control
nothing
did
happen
however
a
great
kiss
of
wind
ran
softly
through
the
awakening
forest
and
a
few
maple
leaves
here
and
there
rustled
tremblingly
to
earth
the
sky
seemed
to
grow
suddenly
much
lighter
simpson
felt
the
cool
air
upon
his
cheek
and
uncovered
head
realized
that
he
was
shivering
with
the
cold
and
making
a
great
effort
realized
next
that
he
was
alone
in
the
bush--and
that
he
was
called
upon
to
take
immediate
steps
to
find
and
succor
his
vanished
companion
make
an
effort
accordingly
he
did
though
an
ill-calculated
and
futile
one
with
that
wilderness
of
trees
about
him
the
sheet
of
water
cutting
him
off
behind
and
the
horror
of
that
wild
cry
in
his
blood
he
did
what
any
other
inexperienced
man
would
have
done
in
similar
bewilderment
he
ran
about
without
any
sense
of
direction
like
a
frantic
child
and
called
loudly
without
ceasing
the
name
of
the
guide
dã©fago
dã©fago
dã©fago
he
yelled
and
the
trees
gave
him
back
the
name
as
often
as
he
shouted
only
a
little
softened--dã©fago
dã©fago
dã©fago
he
followed
the
trail
that
lay
a
short
distance
across
the
patches
of
snow
and
then
lost
it
again
where
the
trees
grew
too
thickly
for
snow
to
lie
he
shouted
till
he
was
hoarse
and
till
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
in
all
that
unanswering
and
listening
world
began
to
frighten
him
his
confusion
increased
in
direct
ratio
to
the
violence
of
his
efforts
his
distress
became
formidably
acute
till
at
length
his
exertions
defeated
their
own
object
and
from
sheer
exhaustion
he
headed
back
to
the
camp
again
it
remains
a
wonder
that
he
ever
found
his
way
it
was
with
great
difficulty
and
only
after
numberless
false
clues
that
he
at
last
saw
the
white
tent
between
the
trees
and
so
reached
safety
exhaustion
then
applied
its
own
remedy
and
he
grew
calmer
he
made
the
fire
and
breakfasted
hot
coffee
and
bacon
put
a
little
sense
and
judgment
into
him
again
and
he
realized
that
he
had
been
behaving
like
a
boy
he
now
made
another
and
more
successful
attempt
to
face
the
situation
collectedly
and
a
nature
naturally
plucky
coming
to
his
assistance
he
decided
that
he
must
first
make
as
thorough
a
search
as
possible
failing
success
in
which
he
must
find
his
way
into
the
home
camp
as
best
he
could
and
bring
help
and
this
was
what
he
did
taking
food
matches
and
rifle
with
him
and
a
small
axe
to
blaze
the
trees
against
his
return
journey
he
set
forth
it
was
eight
o'clock
when
he
started
the
sun
shining
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
a
sky
without
clouds
pinned
to
a
stake
by
the
fire
he
left
a
note
in
case
dã©fago
returned
while
he
was
away
this
time
according
to
a
careful
plan
he
took
a
new
direction
intending
to
make
a
wide
sweep
that
must
sooner
or
later
cut
into
indications
of
the
guide's
trail
and
before
he
had
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
he
came
across
the
tracks
of
a
large
animal
in
the
snow
and
beside
it
the
light
and
smaller
tracks
of
what
were
beyond
question
human
feet--the
feet
of
dã©fago
the
relief
he
at
once
experienced
was
natural
though
brief
for
at
first
sight
he
saw
in
these
tracks
a
simple
explanation
of
the
whole
matter
these
big
marks
had
surely
been
left
by
a
bull
moose
that
wind
against
it
had
blundered
upon
the
camp
and
uttered
its
singular
cry
of
warning
and
alarm
the
moment
its
mistake
was
apparent
dã©fago
in
whom
the
hunting
instinct
was
developed
to
the
point
of
uncanny
perfection
had
scented
the
brute
coming
down
the
wind
hours
before
his
excitement
and
disappearance
were
due
of
course
to--to
his--
then
the
impossible
explanation
at
which
he
grasped
faded
as
common
sense
showed
him
mercilessly
that
none
of
this
was
true
no
guide
much
less
a
guide
like
dã©fago
could
have
acted
in
so
irrational
a
way
going
off
even
without
his
rifle

the
whole
affair
demanded
a
far
more
complicated
elucidation
when
he
remembered
the
details
of
it
all--the
cry
of
terror
the
amazing
language
the
grey
face
of
horror
when
his
nostrils
first
caught
the
new
odor
that
muffled
sobbing
in
the
darkness
and--for
this
too
now
came
back
to
him
dimly--the
man's
original
aversion
for
this
particular
bit
of
country
besides
now
that
he
examined
them
closer
these
were
not
the
tracks
of
a
bull
moose
at
all
hank
had
explained
to
him
the
outline
of
a
bull's
hoofs
of
a
cow's
or
calf's
too
for
that
matter
he
had
drawn
them
clearly
on
a
strip
of
birch
bark
and
these
were
wholly
different
they
were
big
round
ample
and
with
no
pointed
outline
as
of
sharp
hoofs
he
wondered
for
a
moment
whether
bear
tracks
were
like
that
there
was
no
other
animal
he
could
think
of
for
caribou
did
not
come
so
far
south
at
this
season
and
even
if
they
did
would
leave
hoof
marks
they
were
ominous
signs--these
mysterious
writings
left
in
the
snow
by
the
unknown
creature
that
had
lured
a
human
being
away
from
safety--and
when
he
coupled
them
in
his
imagination
with
that
haunting
sound
that
broke
the
stillness
of
the
dawn
a
momentary
dizziness
shook
his
mind
distressing
him
again
beyond
belief
he
felt
the
threatening
aspect
of
it
all
and
stooping
down
to
examine
the
marks
more
closely
he
caught
a
faint
whiff
of
that
sweet
yet
pungent
odor
that
made
him
instantly
straighten
up
again
fighting
a
sensation
almost
of
nausea
then
his
memory
played
him
another
evil
trick
he
suddenly
recalled
those
uncovered
feet
projecting
beyond
the
edge
of
the
tent
and
the
body's
appearance
of
having
been
dragged
towards
the
opening
the
man's
shrinking
from
something
by
the
door
when
he
woke
later
the
details
now
beat
against
his
trembling
mind
with
concerted
attack
they
seemed
to
gather
in
those
deep
spaces
of
the
silent
forest
about
him
where
the
host
of
trees
stood
waiting
listening
watching
to
see
what
he
would
do
the
woods
were
closing
round
him
with
the
persistence
of
true
pluck
however
simpson
went
forward
following
the
tracks
as
best
he
could
smothering
these
ugly
emotions
that
sought
to
weaken
his
will
he
blazed
innumerable
trees
as
he
went
ever
fearful
of
being
unable
to
find
the
way
back
and
calling
aloud
at
intervals
of
a
few
seconds
the
name
of
the
guide
the
dull
tapping
of
the
axe
upon
the
massive
trunks
and
the
unnatural
accents
of
his
own
voice
became
at
length
sounds
that
he
even
dreaded
to
make
dreaded
to
hear
for
they
drew
attention
without
ceasing
to
his
presence
and
exact
whereabouts
and
if
it
were
really
the
case
that
something
was
hunting
himself
down
in
the
same
way
that
he
was
hunting
down
another--
with
a
strong
effort
he
crushed
the
thought
out
the
instant
it
rose
it
was
the
beginning
he
realized
of
a
bewilderment
utterly
diabolical
in
kind
that
would
speedily
destroy
him





although
the
snow
was
not
continuous
lying
merely
in
shallow
flurries
over
the
more
open
spaces
he
found
no
difficulty
in
following
the
tracks
for
the
first
few
miles
they
went
straight
as
a
ruled
line
wherever
the
trees
permitted
the
stride
soon
began
to
increase
in
length
till
it
finally
assumed
proportions
that
seemed
absolutely
impossible
for
any
ordinary
animal
to
have
made
like
huge
flying
leaps
they
became
one
of
these
he
measured
and
though
he
knew
that
stretch
of
eighteen
feet
must
be
somehow
wrong
he
was
at
a
complete
loss
to
understand
why
he
found
no
signs
on
the
snow
between
the
extreme
points
but
what
perplexed
him
even
more
making
him
feel
his
vision
had
gone
utterly
awry
was
that
dã©fago's
stride
increased
in
the
same
manner
and
finally
covered
the
same
incredible
distances
it
looked
as
if
the
great
beast
had
lifted
him
with
it
and
carried
him
across
these
astonishing
intervals
simpson
who
was
much
longer
in
the
limb
found
that
he
could
not
compass
even
half
the
stretch
by
taking
a
running
jump
and
the
sight
of
these
huge
tracks
running
side
by
side
silent
evidence
of
a
dreadful
journey
in
which
terror
or
madness
had
urged
to
impossible
results
was
profoundly
moving
it
shocked
him
in
the
secret
depths
of
his
soul
it
was
the
most
horrible
thing
his
eyes
had
ever
looked
upon
he
began
to
follow
them
mechanically
absentmindedly
almost
ever
peering
over
his
shoulder
to
see
if
he
too
were
being
followed
by
something
with
a
gigantic
tread
and
soon
it
came
about
that
he
no
longer
quite
realized
what
it
was
they
signified--these
impressions
left
upon
the
snow
by
something
nameless
and
untamed
always
accompanied
by
the
footmarks
of
the
little
french
canadian
his
guide
his
comrade
the
man
who
had
shared
his
tent
a
few
hours
before
chatting
laughing
even
singing
by
his
side
v
for
a
man
of
his
years
and
inexperience
only
a
canny
scot
perhaps
grounded
in
common
sense
and
established
in
logic
could
have
preserved
even
that
measure
of
balance
that
this
youth
somehow
or
other
did
manage
to
preserve
through
the
whole
adventure
otherwise
two
things
he
presently
noticed
while
forging
pluckily
ahead
must
have
sent
him
headlong
back
to
the
comparative
safety
of
his
tent
instead
of
only
making
his
hands
close
more
tightly
upon
the
rifle
stock
while
his
heart
trained
for
the
wee
kirk
sent
a
wordless
prayer
winging
its
way
to
heaven
both
tracks
he
saw
had
undergone
a
change
and
this
change
so
far
as
it
concerned
the
footsteps
of
the
man
was
in
some
undecipherable
manner--appalling
it
was
in
the
bigger
tracks
he
first
noticed
this
and
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
quite
believe
his
eyes
was
it
the
blown
leaves
that
produced
odd
effects
of
light
and
shade
or
that
the
dry
snow
drifting
like
finely
ground
rice
about
the
edges
cast
shadows
and
high
lights
or
was
it
actually
the
fact
that
the
great
marks
had
become
faintly
colored
for
round
about
the
deep
plunging
holes
of
the
animal
there
now
appeared
a
mysterious
reddish
tinge
that
was
more
like
an
effect
of
light
than
of
anything
that
dyed
the
substance
of
the
snow
itself
every
mark
had
it
and
had
it
increasingly--this
indistinct
fiery
tinge
that
painted
a
new
touch
of
ghastliness
into
the
picture
but
when
wholly
unable
to
explain
or
to
credit
it
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
other
tracks
to
discover
if
they
too
bore
similar
witness
he
noticed
that
these
had
meanwhile
undergone
a
change
that
was
infinitely
worse
and
charged
with
far
more
horrible
suggestion
for
in
the
last
hundred
yards
or
so
he
saw
that
they
had
grown
gradually
into
the
semblance
of
the
parent
tread
imperceptibly
the
change
had
come
about
yet
unmistakably
it
was
hard
to
see
where
the
change
first
began
the
result
however
was
beyond
question
smaller
neater
more
cleanly
modeled
they
formed
now
an
exact
and
careful
duplicate
of
the
larger
tracks
beside
them
the
feet
that
produced
them
had
therefore
also
changed
and
something
in
his
mind
reared
up
with
loathing
and
with
terror
as
he
saw
it
simpson
for
the
first
time
hesitated
then
ashamed
of
his
alarm
and
indecision
took
a
few
hurried
steps
ahead
the
next
instant
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks
immediately
in
front
of
him
all
signs
of
the
trail
ceased
both
tracks
came
to
an
abrupt
end
on
all
sides
for
a
hundred
yards
and
more
he
searched
in
vain
for
the
least
indication
of
their
continuance
there
was--nothing
the
trees
were
very
thick
just
there
big
trees
all
of
them
spruce
cedar
hemlock
there
was
no
underbrush
he
stood
looking
about
him
all
distraught
bereft
of
any
power
of
judgment
then
he
set
to
work
to
search
again
and
again
and
yet
again
but
always
with
the
same
result
nothing
the
feet
that
printed
the
surface
of
the
snow
thus
far
had
now
apparently
left
the
ground
and
it
was
in
that
moment
of
distress
and
confusion
that
the
whip
of
terror
laid
its
most
nicely
calculated
lash
about
his
heart
it
dropped
with
deadly
effect
upon
the
sorest
spot
of
all
completely
unnerving
him
he
had
been
secretly
dreading
all
the
time
that
it
would
come--and
come
it
did
far
overhead
muted
by
great
height
and
distance
strangely
thinned
and
wailing
he
heard
the
crying
voice
of
dã©fago
the
guide
the
sound
dropped
upon
him
out
of
that
still
wintry
sky
with
an
effect
of
dismay
and
terror
unsurpassed
the
rifle
fell
to
his
feet
he
stood
motionless
an
instant
listening
as
it
were
with
his
whole
body
then
staggered
back
against
the
nearest
tree
for
support
disorganized
hopelessly
in
mind
and
spirit
to
him
in
that
moment
it
seemed
the
most
shattering
and
dislocating
experience
he
had
ever
known
so
that
his
heart
emptied
itself
of
all
feeling
whatsoever
as
by
a
sudden
draught
oh
oh
this
fiery
height
oh
my
feet
of
fire
my
burning
feet
of
fire

ran
in
far
beseeching
accents
of
indescribable
appeal
this
voice
of
anguish
down
the
sky
once
it
called--then
silence
through
all
the
listening
wilderness
of
trees
and
simpson
scarcely
knowing
what
he
did
presently
found
himself
running
wildly
to
and
fro
searching
calling
tripping
over
roots
and
boulders
and
flinging
himself
in
a
frenzy
of
undirected
pursuit
after
the
caller
behind
the
screen
of
memory
and
emotion
with
which
experience
veils
events
he
plunged
distracted
and
half-deranged
picking
up
false
lights
like
a
ship
at
sea
terror
in
his
eyes
and
heart
and
soul
for
the
panic
of
the
wilderness
had
called
to
him
in
that
far
voice--the
power
of
untamed
distance--the
enticement
of
the
desolation
that
destroys
he
knew
in
that
moment
all
the
pains
of
someone
hopelessly
and
irretrievably
lost
suffering
the
lust
and
travail
of
a
soul
in
the
final
loneliness
a
vision
of
dã©fago
eternally
hunted
driven
and
pursued
across
the
skiey
vastness
of
those
ancient
forests
fled
like
a
flame
across
the
dark
ruin
of
his
thoughts

it
seemed
ages
before
he
could
find
anything
in
the
chaos
of
his
disorganized
sensations
to
which
he
could
anchor
himself
steady
for
a
moment
and
think

the
cry
was
not
repeated
his
own
hoarse
calling
brought
no
response
the
inscrutable
forces
of
the
wild
had
summoned
their
victim
beyond
recall--and
held
him
fast





yet
he
searched
and
called
it
seems
for
hours
afterwards
for
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
at
length
he
decided
to
abandon
a
useless
pursuit
and
return
to
his
camp
on
the
shores
of
fifty
island
water
even
then
he
went
with
reluctance
that
crying
voice
still
echoing
in
his
ears
with
difficulty
he
found
his
rifle
and
the
homeward
trail
the
concentration
necessary
to
follow
the
badly
blazed
trees
and
a
biting
hunger
that
gnawed
helped
to
keep
his
mind
steady
otherwise
he
admits
the
temporary
aberration
he
had
suffered
might
have
been
prolonged
to
the
point
of
positive
disaster
gradually
the
ballast
shifted
back
again
and
he
regained
something
that
approached
his
normal
equilibrium
but
for
all
that
the
journey
through
the
gathering
dusk
was
miserably
haunted
he
heard
innumerable
following
footsteps
voices
that
laughed
and
whispered
and
saw
figures
crouching
behind
trees
and
boulders
making
signs
to
one
another
for
a
concerted
attack
the
moment
he
had
passed
the
creeping
murmur
of
the
wind
made
him
start
and
listen
he
went
stealthily
trying
to
hide
where
possible
and
making
as
little
sound
as
he
could
the
shadows
of
the
woods
hitherto
protective
or
covering
merely
had
now
become
menacing
challenging
and
the
pageantry
in
his
frightened
mind
masked
a
host
of
possibilities
that
were
all
the
more
ominous
for
being
obscure
the
presentiment
of
a
nameless
doom
lurked
ill-concealed
behind
every
detail
of
what
had
happened
it
was
really
admirable
how
he
emerged
victor
in
the
end
men
of
riper
powers
and
experience
might
have
come
through
the
ordeal
with
less
success
he
had
himself
tolerably
well
in
hand
all
things
considered
and
his
plan
of
action
proves
it
sleep
being
absolutely
out
of
the
question
and
traveling
an
unknown
trail
in
the
darkness
equally
impracticable
he
sat
up
the
whole
of
that
night
rifle
in
hand
before
a
fire
he
never
for
a
single
moment
allowed
to
die
down
the
severity
of
the
haunted
vigil
marked
his
soul
for
life
but
it
was
successfully
accomplished
and
with
the
very
first
signs
of
dawn
he
set
forth
upon
the
long
return
journey
to
the
home
camp
to
get
help
as
before
he
left
a
written
note
to
explain
his
absence
and
to
indicate
where
he
had
left
a
plentiful
cache
of
food
and
matches--though
he
had
no
expectation
that
any
human
hands
would
find
them
how
simpson
found
his
way
alone
by
the
lake
and
forest
might
well
make
a
story
in
itself
for
to
hear
him
tell
it
is
to
know
the
passionate
loneliness
of
soul
that
a
man
can
feel
when
the
wilderness
holds
him
in
the
hollow
of
its
illimitable
hand--and
laughs
it
is
also
to
admire
his
indomitable
pluck
he
claims
no
skill
declaring
that
he
followed
the
almost
invisible
trail
mechanically
and
without
thinking
and
this
doubtless
is
the
truth
he
relied
upon
the
guiding
of
the
unconscious
mind
which
is
instinct
perhaps
too
some
sense
of
orientation
known
to
animals
and
primitive
men
may
have
helped
as
well
for
through
all
that
tangled
region
he
succeeded
in
reaching
the
exact
spot
where
dã©fago
had
hidden
the
canoe
nearly
three
days
before
with
the
remark
strike
doo
west
across
the
lake
into
the
sun
to
find
the
camp
there
was
not
much
sun
left
to
guide
him
but
he
used
his
compass
to
the
best
of
his
ability
embarking
in
the
frail
craft
for
the
last
twelve
miles
of
his
journey
with
a
sensation
of
immense
relief
that
the
forest
was
at
last
behind
him
and
fortunately
the
water
was
calm
he
took
his
line
across
the
center
of
the
lake
instead
of
coasting
round
the
shores
for
another
twenty
miles
fortunately
too
the
other
hunters
were
back
the
light
of
their
fires
furnished
a
steering
point
without
which
he
might
have
searched
all
night
long
for
the
actual
position
of
the
camp
it
was
close
upon
midnight
all
the
same
when
his
canoe
grated
on
the
sandy
cove
and
hank
punk
and
his
uncle
disturbed
in
their
sleep
by
his
cries
ran
quickly
down
and
helped
a
very
exhausted
and
broken
specimen
of
scotch
humanity
over
the
rocks
toward
a
dying
fire
vi
the
sudden
entrance
of
his
prosaic
uncle
into
this
world
of
wizardry
and
horror
that
had
haunted
him
without
interruption
now
for
two
days
and
two
nights
had
the
immediate
effect
of
giving
to
the
affair
an
entirely
new
aspect
the
sound
of
that
crisp
hulloa
my
boy
and
what's
up
now
and
the
grasp
of
that
dry
and
vigorous
hand
introduced
another
standard
of
judgment
a
revulsion
of
feeling
washed
through
him
he
realized
that
he
had
let
himself
go
rather
badly
he
even
felt
vaguely
ashamed
of
himself
the
native
hard-headedness
of
his
race
reclaimed
him
and
this
doubtless
explains
why
he
found
it
so
hard
to
tell
that
group
round
the
fire--everything
he
told
enough
however
for
the
immediate
decision
to
be
arrived
at
that
a
relief
party
must
start
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
and
that
simpson
in
order
to
guide
it
capably
must
first
have
food
and
above
all
sleep
dr
cathcart
observing
the
lad's
condition
more
shrewdly
than
his
patient
knew
gave
him
a
very
slight
injection
of
morphine
for
six
hours
he
slept
like
the
dead
from
the
description
carefully
written
out
afterwards
by
this
student
of
divinity
it
appears
that
the
account
he
gave
to
the
astonished
group
omitted
sundry
vital
and
important
details
he
declares
that
with
his
uncle's
wholesome
matter-of-fact
countenance
staring
him
in
the
face
he
simply
had
not
the
courage
to
mention
them
thus
all
the
search
party
gathered
it
would
seem
was
that
dã©fago
had
suffered
in
the
night
an
acute
and
inexplicable
attack
of
mania
had
imagined
himself
called
by
someone
or
something
and
had
plunged
into
the
bush
after
it
without
food
or
rifle
where
he
must
die
a
horrible
and
lingering
death
by
cold
and
starvation
unless
he
could
be
found
and
rescued
in
time
in
time
moreover
meant
at
once
in
the
course
of
the
following
day
however--they
were
off
by
seven
leaving
punk
in
charge
with
instructions
to
have
food
and
fire
always
ready--simpson
found
it
possible
to
tell
his
uncle
a
good
deal
more
of
the
story's
true
inwardness
without
divining
that
it
was
drawn
out
of
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
by
a
very
subtle
form
of
cross
examination
by
the
time
they
reached
the
beginning
of
the
trail
where
the
canoe
was
laid
up
against
the
return
journey
he
had
mentioned
how
dã©fago
spoke
vaguely
of
something
he
called
a
'wendigo'
how
he
cried
in
his
sleep
how
he
imagined
an
unusual
scent
about
the
camp
and
had
betrayed
other
symptoms
of
mental
excitement
he
also
admitted
the
bewildering
effect
of
that
extraordinary
odor
upon
himself
pungent
and
acrid
like
the
odor
of
lions
and
by
the
time
they
were
within
an
easy
hour
of
fifty
island
water
he
had
let
slip
the
further
fact--a
foolish
avowal
of
his
own
hysterical
condition
as
he
felt
afterwards--that
he
had
heard
the
vanished
guide
call
for
help
he
omitted
the
singular
phrases
used
for
he
simply
could
not
bring
himself
to
repeat
the
preposterous
language
also
while
describing
how
the
man's
footsteps
in
the
snow
had
gradually
assumed
an
exact
miniature
likeness
of
the
animal's
plunging
tracks
he
left
out
the
fact
that
they
measured
a
wholly
incredible
distance
it
seemed
a
question
nicely
balanced
between
individual
pride
and
honesty
what
he
should
reveal
and
what
suppress
he
mentioned
the
fiery
tinge
in
the
snow
for
instance
yet
shrank
from
telling
that
body
and
bed
had
been
partly
dragged
out
of
the
tent
with
the
net
result
that
dr
cathcart
adroit
psychologist
that
he
fancied
himself
to
be
had
assured
him
clearly
enough
exactly
where
his
mind
influenced
by
loneliness
bewilderment
and
terror
had
yielded
to
the
strain
and
invited
delusion
while
praising
his
conduct
he
managed
at
the
same
time
to
point
out
where
when
and
how
his
mind
had
gone
astray
he
made
his
nephew
think
himself
finer
than
he
was
by
judicious
praise
yet
more
foolish
than
he
was
by
minimizing
the
value
of
the
evidence
like
many
another
materialist
that
is
he
lied
cleverly
on
the
basis
of
insufficient
knowledge
because
the
knowledge
supplied
seemed
to
his
own
particular
intelligence
inadmissible
the
spell
of
these
terrible
solitudes
he
said
cannot
leave
any
mind
untouched
any
mind
that
is
possessed
of
the
higher
imaginative
qualities
it
has
worked
upon
yours
exactly
as
it
worked
upon
my
own
when
i
was
your
age
the
animal
that
haunted
your
little
camp
was
undoubtedly
a
moose
for
the
'belling'
of
a
moose
may
have
sometimes
a
very
peculiar
quality
of
sound
the
colored
appearance
of
the
big
tracks
was
obviously
a
defect
of
vision
in
your
own
eyes
produced
by
excitement
the
size
and
stretch
of
the
tracks
we
shall
prove
when
we
come
to
them
but
the
hallucination
of
an
audible
voice
of
course
is
one
of
the
commonest
forms
of
delusion
due
to
mental
excitement--an
excitement
my
dear
boy
perfectly
excusable
and
let
me
add
wonderfully
controlled
by
you
under
the
circumstances
for
the
rest
i
am
bound
to
say
you
have
acted
with
a
splendid
courage
for
the
terror
of
feeling
oneself
lost
in
this
wilderness
is
nothing
short
of
awful
and
had
i
been
in
your
place
i
don't
for
a
moment
believe
i
could
have
behaved
with
one
quarter
of
your
wisdom
and
decision
the
only
thing
i
find
it
uncommonly
difficult
to
explain
is--that--damned
odor
it
made
me
feel
sick
i
assure
you
declared
his
nephew
positively
dizzy
his
uncle's
attitude
of
calm
omniscience
merely
because
he
knew
more
psychological
formulae
made
him
slightly
defiant
it
was
so
easy
to
be
wise
in
the
explanation
of
an
experience
one
has
not
personally
witnessed
a
kind
of
desolate
and
terrible
odor
is
the
only
way
i
can
describe
it
he
concluded
glancing
at
the
features
of
the
quiet
unemotional
man
beside
him
i
can
only
marvel
was
the
reply
that
under
the
circumstances
it
did
not
seem
to
you
even
worse
the
dry
words
simpson
knew
hovered
between
the
truth
and
his
uncle's
interpretation
of
the
truth





and
so
at
last
they
came
to
the
little
camp
and
found
the
tent
still
standing
the
remains
of
the
fire
and
the
piece
of
paper
pinned
to
a
stake
beside
it--untouched
the
cache
poorly
contrived
by
inexperienced
hands
however
had
been
discovered
and
opened--by
musk
rats
mink
and
squirrel
the
matches
lay
scattered
about
the
opening
but
the
food
had
been
taken
to
the
last
crumb
well
fellers
he
ain't
here
exclaimed
hank
loudly
after
his
fashion
and
that's
as
sartain
as
the
coal
supply
down
below
but
whar
he's
got
to
by
this
time
is
'bout
as
unsartain
as
the
trade
in
crowns
in
t'other
place
the
presence
of
a
divinity
student
was
no
barrier
to
his
language
at
such
a
time
though
for
the
reader's
sake
it
may
be
severely
edited
i
propose
he
added
that
we
start
out
at
once
an'
hunt
for'm
like
hell
the
gloom
of
dã©fago's
probable
fate
oppressed
the
whole
party
with
a
sense
of
dreadful
gravity
the
moment
they
saw
the
familiar
signs
of
recent
occupancy
especially
the
tent
with
the
bed
of
balsam
branches
still
smoothed
and
flattened
by
the
pressure
of
his
body
seemed
to
bring
his
presence
near
to
them
simpson
feeling
vaguely
as
if
his
world
were
somehow
at
stake
went
about
explaining
particulars
in
a
hushed
tone
he
was
much
calmer
now
though
overwearied
with
the
strain
of
his
many
journeys
his
uncle's
method
of
explaining--explaining
away
rather--the
details
still
fresh
in
his
haunted
memory
helped
too
to
put
ice
upon
his
emotions
and
that's
the
direction
he
ran
off
in
he
said
to
his
two
companions
pointing
in
the
direction
where
the
guide
had
vanished
that
morning
in
the
grey
dawn
straight
down
there
he
ran
like
a
deer
in
between
the
birch
and
the
hemlock
hank
and
dr
cathcart
exchanged
glances
and
it
was
about
two
miles
down
there
in
a
straight
line
continued
the
other
speaking
with
something
of
the
former
terror
in
his
voice
that
i
followed
his
trail
to
the
place
where--it
stopped--dead
and
where
you
heered
him
callin'
an'
caught
the
stench
an'
all
the
rest
of
the
wicked
entertainment
cried
hank
with
a
volubility
that
betrayed
his
keen
distress
and
where
your
excitement
overcame
you
to
the
point
of
producing
illusions
added
dr
cathcart
under
his
breath
yet
not
so
low
that
his
nephew
did
not
hear
it





it
was
early
in
the
afternoon
for
they
had
traveled
quickly
and
there
were
still
a
good
two
hours
of
daylight
left
dr
cathcart
and
hank
lost
no
time
in
beginning
the
search
but
simpson
was
too
exhausted
to
accompany
them
they
would
follow
the
blazed
marks
on
the
trees
and
where
possible
his
footsteps
meanwhile
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
keep
a
good
fire
going
and
rest
but
after
something
like
three
hours'
search
the
darkness
already
down
the
two
men
returned
to
camp
with
nothing
to
report
fresh
snow
had
covered
all
signs
and
though
they
had
followed
the
blazed
trees
to
the
spot
where
simpson
had
turned
back
they
had
not
discovered
the
smallest
indication
of
a
human
being--or
for
that
matter
of
an
animal
there
were
no
fresh
tracks
of
any
kind
the
snow
lay
undisturbed
it
was
difficult
to
know
what
was
best
to
do
though
in
reality
there
was
nothing
more
they
could
do
they
might
stay
and
search
for
weeks
without
much
chance
of
success
the
fresh
snow
destroyed
their
only
hope
and
they
gathered
round
the
fire
for
supper
a
gloomy
and
despondent
party
the
facts
indeed
were
sad
enough
for
dã©fago
had
a
wife
at
rat
portage
and
his
earnings
were
the
family's
sole
means
of
support
now
that
the
whole
truth
in
all
its
ugliness
was
out
it
seemed
useless
to
deal
in
further
disguise
or
pretense
they
talked
openly
of
the
facts
and
probabilities
it
was
not
the
first
time
even
in
the
experience
of
dr
cathcart
that
a
man
had
yielded
to
the
singular
seduction
of
the
solitudes
and
gone
out
of
his
mind
dã©fago
moreover
was
predisposed
to
something
of
the
sort
for
he
already
had
a
touch
of
melancholia
in
his
blood
and
his
fiber
was
weakened
by
bouts
of
drinking
that
often
lasted
for
weeks
at
a
time
something
on
this
trip--one
might
never
know
precisely
what--had
sufficed
to
push
him
over
the
line
that
was
all
and
he
had
gone
gone
off
into
the
great
wilderness
of
trees
and
lakes
to
die
by
starvation
and
exhaustion
the
chances
against
his
finding
camp
again
were
overwhelming
the
delirium
that
was
upon
him
would
also
doubtless
have
increased
and
it
was
quite
likely
he
might
do
violence
to
himself
and
so
hasten
his
cruel
fate
even
while
they
talked
indeed
the
end
had
probably
come
on
the
suggestion
of
hank
his
old
pal
however
they
proposed
to
wait
a
little
longer
and
devote
the
whole
of
the
following
day
from
dawn
to
darkness
to
the
most
systematic
search
they
could
devise
they
would
divide
the
territory
between
them
they
discussed
their
plan
in
great
detail
all
that
men
could
do
they
would
do
and
meanwhile
they
talked
about
the
particular
form
in
which
the
singular
panic
of
the
wilderness
had
made
its
attack
upon
the
mind
of
the
unfortunate
guide
hank
though
familiar
with
the
legend
in
its
general
outline
obviously
did
not
welcome
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
he
contributed
little
though
that
little
was
illuminating
for
he
admitted
that
a
story
ran
over
all
this
section
of
country
to
the
effect
that
several
indians
had
seen
the
wendigo
along
the
shores
of
fifty
island
water
in
the
fall
of
last
year
and
that
this
was
the
true
reason
of
dã©fago's
disinclination
to
hunt
there
hank
doubtless
felt
that
he
had
in
a
sense
helped
his
old
pal
to
death
by
overpersuading
him
when
an
indian
goes
crazy
he
explained
talking
to
himself
more
than
to
the
others
it
seemed
it's
always
put
that
he's
'seen
the
wendigo'
an'
pore
old
dã©faygo
was
superstitious
down
to
he
very
heels

and
then
simpson
feeling
the
atmosphere
more
sympathetic
told
over
again
the
full
story
of
his
astonishing
tale
he
left
out
no
details
this
time
he
mentioned
his
own
sensations
and
gripping
fears
he
only
omitted
the
strange
language
used
but
dã©fago
surely
had
already
told
you
all
these
details
of
the
wendigo
legend
my
dear
fellow
insisted
the
doctor
i
mean
he
had
talked
about
it
and
thus
put
into
your
mind
the
ideas
which
your
own
excitement
afterwards
developed
whereupon
simpson
again
repeated
the
facts
dã©fago
he
declared
had
barely
mentioned
the
beast
he
simpson
knew
nothing
of
the
story
and
so
far
as
he
remembered
had
never
even
read
about
it
even
the
word
was
unfamiliar
of
course
he
was
telling
the
truth
and
dr
cathcart
was
reluctantly
compelled
to
admit
the
singular
character
of
the
whole
affair
he
did
not
do
this
in
words
so
much
as
in
manner
however
he
kept
his
back
against
a
good
stout
tree
he
poked
the
fire
into
a
blaze
the
moment
it
showed
signs
of
dying
down
he
was
quicker
than
any
of
them
to
notice
the
least
sound
in
the
night
about
them--a
fish
jumping
in
the
lake
a
twig
snapping
in
the
bush
the
dropping
of
occasional
fragments
of
frozen
snow
from
the
branches
overhead
where
the
heat
loosened
them
his
voice
too
changed
a
little
in
quality
becoming
a
shade
less
confident
lower
also
in
tone
fear
to
put
it
plainly
hovered
close
about
that
little
camp
and
though
all
three
would
have
been
glad
to
speak
of
other
matters
the
only
thing
they
seemed
able
to
discuss
was
this--the
source
of
their
fear
they
tried
other
subjects
in
vain
there
was
nothing
to
say
about
them
hank
was
the
most
honest
of
the
group
he
said
next
to
nothing
he
never
once
however
turned
his
back
to
the
darkness
his
face
was
always
to
the
forest
and
when
wood
was
needed
he
didn't
go
farther
than
was
necessary
to
get
it
vii
a
wall
of
silence
wrapped
them
in
for
the
snow
though
not
thick
was
sufficient
to
deaden
any
noise
and
the
frost
held
things
pretty
tight
besides
no
sound
but
their
voices
and
the
soft
roar
of
the
flames
made
itself
heard
only
from
time
to
time
something
soft
as
the
flutter
of
a
pine
moth's
wings
went
past
them
through
the
air
no
one
seemed
anxious
to
go
to
bed
the
hours
slipped
towards
midnight
the
legend
is
picturesque
enough
observed
the
doctor
after
one
of
the
longer
pauses
speaking
to
break
it
rather
than
because
he
had
anything
to
say
for
the
wendigo
is
simply
the
call
of
the
wild
personified
which
some
natures
hear
to
their
own
destruction
that's
about
it
hank
said
presently
an'
there's
no
misunderstandin'
when
you
hear
it
it
calls
you
by
name
right
'nough
another
pause
followed
then
dr
cathcart
came
back
to
the
forbidden
subject
with
a
rush
that
made
the
others
jump
the
allegory
is
significant
he
remarked
looking
about
him
into
the
darkness
for
the
voice
they
say
resembles
all
the
minor
sounds
of
the
bush--wind
falling
water
cries
of
the
animals
and
so
forth
and
once
the
victim
hears
that--he's
off
for
good
of
course
his
most
vulnerable
points
moreover
are
said
to
be
the
feet
and
the
eyes
the
feet
you
see
for
the
lust
of
wandering
and
the
eyes
for
the
lust
of
beauty
the
poor
beggar
goes
at
such
a
dreadful
speed
that
he
bleeds
beneath
the
eyes
and
his
feet
burn
dr
cathcart
as
he
spoke
continued
to
peer
uneasily
into
the
surrounding
gloom
his
voice
sank
to
a
hushed
tone
the
wendigo
he
added
is
said
to
burn
his
feet--owing
to
the
friction
apparently
caused
by
its
tremendous
velocity--till
they
drop
off
and
new
ones
form
exactly
like
its
own
simpson
listened
in
horrified
amazement
but
it
was
the
pallor
on
hank's
face
that
fascinated
him
most
he
would
willingly
have
stopped
his
ears
and
closed
his
eyes
had
he
dared
it
don't
always
keep
to
the
ground
neither
came
in
hank's
slow
heavy
drawl
for
it
goes
so
high
that
he
thinks
the
stars
have
set
him
all
a-fire
an'
it'll
take
great
thumpin'
jumps
sometimes
an'
run
along
the
tops
of
the
trees
carrying
its
partner
with
it
an'
then
droppin'
him
jest
as
a
fish
hawk'll
drop
a
pickerel
to
kill
it
before
eatin'
an'
its
food
of
all
the
muck
in
the
whole
bush
is--moss
and
he
laughed
a
short
unnatural
laugh
it's
a
moss-eater
is
the
wendigo
he
added
looking
up
excitedly
into
the
faces
of
his
companions
moss-eater
he
repeated
with
a
string
of
the
most
outlandish
oaths
he
could
invent
but
simpson
now
understood
the
true
purpose
of
all
this
talk
what
these
two
men
each
strong
and
experienced
in
his
own
way
dreaded
more
than
anything
else
was--silence
they
were
talking
against
time
they
were
also
talking
against
darkness
against
the
invasion
of
panic
against
the
admission
reflection
might
bring
that
they
were
in
an
enemy's
country--against
anything
in
fact
rather
than
allow
their
inmost
thoughts
to
assume
control
he
himself
already
initiated
by
the
awful
vigil
with
terror
was
beyond
both
of
them
in
this
respect
he
had
reached
the
stage
where
he
was
immune
but
these
two
the
scoffing
analytical
doctor
and
the
honest
dogged
backwoodsman
each
sat
trembling
in
the
depths
of
his
being
thus
the
hours
passed
and
thus
with
lowered
voices
and
a
kind
of
taut
inner
resistance
of
spirit
this
little
group
of
humanity
sat
in
the
jaws
of
the
wilderness
and
talked
foolishly
of
the
terrible
and
haunting
legend
it
was
an
unequal
contest
all
things
considered
for
the
wilderness
had
already
the
advantage
of
first
attack--and
of
a
hostage
the
fate
of
their
comrade
hung
over
them
with
a
steadily
increasing
weight
of
oppression
that
finally
became
insupportable
it
was
hank
after
a
pause
longer
than
the
preceding
ones
that
no
one
seemed
able
to
break
who
first
let
loose
all
this
pent-up
emotion
in
very
unexpected
fashion
by
springing
suddenly
to
his
feet
and
letting
out
the
most
ear-shattering
yell
imaginable
into
the
night
he
could
not
contain
himself
any
longer
it
seemed
to
make
it
carry
even
beyond
an
ordinary
cry
he
interrupted
its
rhythm
by
shaking
the
palm
of
his
hand
before
his
mouth
that's
for
dã©fago
he
said
looking
down
at
the
other
two
with
a
queer
defiant
laugh
for
it's
my
belief--the
sandwiched
oaths
may
be
omitted--that
my
ole
partner's
not
far
from
us
at
this
very
minute
there
was
a
vehemence
and
recklessness
about
his
performance
that
made
simpson
too
start
to
his
feet
in
amazement
and
betrayed
even
the
doctor
into
letting
the
pipe
slip
from
between
his
lips
hank's
face
was
ghastly
but
cathcart's
showed
a
sudden
weakness--a
loosening
of
all
his
faculties
as
it
were
then
a
momentary
anger
blazed
into
his
eyes
and
he
too
though
with
deliberation
born
of
habitual
self-control
got
upon
his
feet
and
faced
the
excited
guide
for
this
was
unpermissible
foolish
dangerous
and
he
meant
to
stop
it
in
the
bud
what
might
have
happened
in
the
next
minute
or
two
one
may
speculate
about
yet
never
definitely
know
for
in
the
instant
of
profound
silence
that
followed
hank's
roaring
voice
and
as
though
in
answer
to
it
something
went
past
through
the
darkness
of
the
sky
overhead
at
terrific
speed--something
of
necessity
very
large
for
it
displaced
much
air
while
down
between
the
trees
there
fell
a
faint
and
windy
cry
of
a
human
voice
calling
in
tones
of
indescribable
anguish
and
appeal--
oh
oh
this
fiery
height
oh
oh
my
feet
of
fire
my
burning
feet
of
fire
white
to
the
very
edge
of
his
shirt
hank
looked
stupidly
about
him
like
a
child
dr
cathcart
uttered
some
kind
of
unintelligible
cry
turning
as
he
did
so
with
an
instinctive
movement
of
blind
terror
towards
the
protection
of
the
tent
then
halting
in
the
act
as
though
frozen
simpson
alone
of
the
three
retained
his
presence
of
mind
a
little
his
own
horror
was
too
deep
to
allow
of
any
immediate
reaction
he
had
heard
that
cry
before
turning
to
his
stricken
companions
he
said
almost
calmly--
that's
exactly
the
cry
i
heard--the
very
words
he
used
then
lifting
his
face
to
the
sky
he
cried
aloud
dã©fago
dã©fago
come
down
here
to
us
come
down--
and
before
there
was
time
for
anybody
to
take
definite
action
one
way
or
another
there
came
the
sound
of
something
dropping
heavily
between
the
trees
striking
the
branches
on
the
way
down
and
landing
with
a
dreadful
thud
upon
the
frozen
earth
below
the
crash
and
thunder
of
it
was
really
terrific
that's
him
s'help
me
the
good
gawd
came
from
hank
in
a
whispering
cry
half
choked
his
hand
going
automatically
toward
the
hunting
knife
in
his
belt
and
he's
coming
he's
coming
he
added
with
an
irrational
laugh
of
horror
as
the
sounds
of
heavy
footsteps
crunching
over
the
snow
became
distinctly
audible
approaching
through
the
blackness
towards
the
circle
of
light
and
while
the
steps
with
their
stumbling
motion
moved
nearer
and
nearer
upon
them
the
three
men
stood
round
that
fire
motionless
and
dumb
dr
cathcart
had
the
appearance
of
a
man
suddenly
withered
even
his
eyes
did
not
move
hank
suffering
shockingly
seemed
on
the
verge
again
of
violent
action
yet
did
nothing
he
too
was
hewn
of
stone
like
stricken
children
they
seemed
the
picture
was
hideous
and
meanwhile
their
owner
still
invisible
the
footsteps
came
closer
crunching
the
frozen
snow
it
was
endless--too
prolonged
to
be
quite
real--this
measured
and
pitiless
approach
it
was
accursed
viii
then
at
length
the
darkness
having
thus
laboriously
conceived
brought
forth--a
figure
it
drew
forward
into
the
zone
of
uncertain
light
where
fire
and
shadows
mingled
not
ten
feet
away
then
halted
staring
at
them
fixedly
the
same
instant
it
started
forward
again
with
the
spasmodic
motion
as
of
a
thing
moved
by
wires
and
coming
up
closer
to
them
full
into
the
glare
of
the
fire
they
perceived
then
that--it
was
a
man
and
apparently
that
this
man
was--dã©fago
something
like
a
skin
of
horror
almost
perceptibly
drew
down
in
that
moment
over
every
face
and
three
pairs
of
eyes
shone
through
it
as
though
they
saw
across
the
frontiers
of
normal
vision
into
the
unknown
dã©fago
advanced
his
tread
faltering
and
uncertain
he
made
his
way
straight
up
to
them
as
a
group
first
then
turned
sharply
and
peered
close
into
the
face
of
simpson
the
sound
of
a
voice
issued
from
his
lips--
here
i
am
boss
simpson
i
heered
someone
calling
me
it
was
a
faint
dried
up
voice
made
wheezy
and
breathless
as
by
immense
exertion
i'm
havin'
a
reg'lar
hellfire
kind
of
a
trip
i
am
and
he
laughed
thrusting
his
head
forward
into
the
other's
face
but
that
laugh
started
the
machinery
of
the
group
of
waxwork
figures
with
the
wax-white
skins
hank
immediately
sprang
forward
with
a
stream
of
oaths
so
farfetched
that
simpson
did
not
recognize
them
as
english
at
all
but
thought
he
had
lapsed
into
indian
or
some
other
lingo
he
only
realized
that
hank's
presence
thrust
thus
between
them
was
welcome--uncommonly
welcome
dr
cathcart
though
more
calmly
and
leisurely
advanced
behind
him
heavily
stumbling
simpson
seems
hazy
as
to
what
was
actually
said
and
done
in
those
next
few
seconds
for
the
eyes
of
that
detestable
and
blasted
visage
peering
at
such
close
quarters
into
his
own
utterly
bewildered
his
senses
at
first
he
merely
stood
still
he
said
nothing
he
had
not
the
trained
will
of
the
older
men
that
forced
them
into
action
in
defiance
of
all
emotional
stress
he
watched
them
moving
as
behind
a
glass
that
half
destroyed
their
reality
it
was
dreamlike
perverted
yet
through
the
torrent
of
hank's
meaningless
phrases
he
remembers
hearing
his
uncle's
tone
of
authority--hard
and
forced--saying
several
things
about
food
and
warmth
blankets
whisky
and
the
rest

and
further
that
whiffs
of
that
penetrating
unaccustomed
odor
vile
yet
sweetly
bewildering
assailed
his
nostrils
during
all
that
followed
it
was
no
less
a
person
than
himself
however--less
experienced
and
adroit
than
the
others
though
he
was--who
gave
instinctive
utterance
to
the
sentence
that
brought
a
measure
of
relief
into
the
ghastly
situation
by
expressing
the
doubt
and
thought
in
each
one's
heart
it
is--you
isn't
it
dã©fago
he
asked
under
his
breath
horror
breaking
his
speech
and
at
once
cathcart
burst
out
with
the
loud
answer
before
the
other
had
time
to
move
his
lips
of
course
it
is
of
course
it
is
only--can't
you
see--he's
nearly
dead
with
exhaustion
cold
and
terror
isn't
that
enough
to
change
a
man
beyond
all
recognition
it
was
said
in
order
to
convince
himself
as
much
as
to
convince
the
others
the
overemphasis
alone
proved
that
and
continually
while
he
spoke
and
acted
he
held
a
handkerchief
to
his
nose
that
odor
pervaded
the
whole
camp
for
the
dã©fago
who
sat
huddled
by
the
big
fire
wrapped
in
blankets
drinking
hot
whisky
and
holding
food
in
wasted
hands
was
no
more
like
the
guide
they
had
last
seen
alive
than
the
picture
of
a
man
of
sixty
is
like
a
daguerreotype
of
his
early
youth
in
the
costume
of
another
generation
nothing
really
can
describe
that
ghastly
caricature
that
parody
masquerading
there
in
the
firelight
as
dã©fago
from
the
ruins
of
the
dark
and
awful
memories
he
still
retains
simpson
declares
that
the
face
was
more
animal
than
human
the
features
drawn
about
into
wrong
proportions
the
skin
loose
and
hanging
as
though
he
had
been
subjected
to
extraordinary
pressures
and
tensions
it
made
him
think
vaguely
of
those
bladder
faces
blown
up
by
the
hawkers
on
ludgate
hill
that
change
their
expression
as
they
swell
and
as
they
collapse
emit
a
faint
and
wailing
imitation
of
a
voice
both
face
and
voice
suggested
some
such
abominable
resemblance
but
cathcart
long
afterwards
seeking
to
describe
the
indescribable
asserts
that
thus
might
have
looked
a
face
and
body
that
had
been
in
air
so
rarified
that
the
weight
of
atmosphere
being
removed
the
entire
structure
threatened
to
fly
asunder
and
become--incoherent
it
was
hank
though
all
distraught
and
shaking
with
a
tearing
volume
of
emotion
he
could
neither
handle
nor
understand
who
brought
things
to
a
head
without
much
ado
he
went
off
to
a
little
distance
from
the
fire
apparently
so
that
the
light
should
not
dazzle
him
too
much
and
shading
his
eyes
for
a
moment
with
both
hands
shouted
in
a
loud
voice
that
held
anger
and
affection
dreadfully
mingled
you
ain't
dã©faygo
you
ain't
dã©faygo
at
all
i
don't
give
a--damn
but
that
ain't
you
my
ole
pal
of
twenty
years
he
glared
upon
the
huddled
figure
as
though
he
would
destroy
him
with
his
eyes
an'
if
it
is
i'll
swab
the
floor
of
hell
with
a
wad
of
cotton
wool
on
a
toothpick
s'help
me
the
good
gawd
he
added
with
a
violent
fling
of
horror
and
disgust
it
was
impossible
to
silence
him
he
stood
there
shouting
like
one
possessed
horrible
to
see
horrible
to
hear--because
it
was
the
truth
he
repeated
himself
in
fifty
different
ways
each
more
outlandish
than
the
last
the
woods
rang
with
echoes
at
one
time
it
looked
as
if
he
meant
to
fling
himself
upon
the
intruder
for
his
hand
continually
jerked
towards
the
long
hunting
knife
in
his
belt
but
in
the
end
he
did
nothing
and
the
whole
tempest
completed
itself
very
shortly
with
tears
hank's
voice
suddenly
broke
he
collapsed
on
the
ground
and
cathcart
somehow
or
other
persuaded
him
at
last
to
go
into
the
tent
and
lie
quiet
the
remainder
of
the
affair
indeed
was
witnessed
by
him
from
behind
the
canvas
his
white
and
terrified
face
peeping
through
the
crack
of
the
tent
door
flap
then
dr
cathcart
closely
followed
by
his
nephew
who
so
far
had
kept
his
courage
better
than
all
of
them
went
up
with
a
determined
air
and
stood
opposite
to
the
figure
of
dã©fago
huddled
over
the
fire
he
looked
him
squarely
in
the
face
and
spoke
at
first
his
voice
was
firm
dã©fago
tell
us
what's
happened--just
a
little
so
that
we
can
know
how
best
to
help
you
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
authority
almost
of
command
and
at
that
point
it
was
command
at
once
afterwards
however
it
changed
in
quality
for
the
figure
turned
up
to
him
a
face
so
piteous
so
terrible
and
so
little
like
humanity
that
the
doctor
shrank
back
from
him
as
from
something
spiritually
unclean
simpson
watching
close
behind
him
says
he
got
the
impression
of
a
mask
that
was
on
the
verge
of
dropping
off
and
that
underneath
they
would
discover
something
black
and
diabolical
revealed
in
utter
nakedness
out
with
it
man
out
with
it
cathcart
cried
terror
running
neck
and
neck
with
entreaty
none
of
us
can
stand
this
much
longer

it
was
the
cry
of
instinct
over
reason
and
then
dã©fago
smiling
whitely
answered
in
that
thin
and
fading
voice
that
already
seemed
passing
over
into
a
sound
of
quite
another
character--
i
seen
that
great
wendigo
thing
he
whispered
sniffing
the
air
about
him
exactly
like
an
animal
i
been
with
it
too--
whether
the
poor
devil
would
have
said
more
or
whether
dr
cathcart
would
have
continued
the
impossible
cross
examination
cannot
be
known
for
at
that
moment
the
voice
of
hank
was
heard
yelling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
from
behind
the
canvas
that
concealed
all
but
his
terrified
eyes
such
a
howling
was
never
heard
his
feet
oh
gawd
his
feet
look
at
his
great
changed--feet
dã©fago
shuffling
where
he
sat
had
moved
in
such
a
way
that
for
the
first
time
his
legs
were
in
full
light
and
his
feet
were
visible
yet
simpson
had
no
time
himself
to
see
properly
what
hank
had
seen
and
hank
has
never
seen
fit
to
tell
that
same
instant
with
a
leap
like
that
of
a
frightened
tiger
cathcart
was
upon
him
bundling
the
folds
of
blanket
about
his
legs
with
such
speed
that
the
young
student
caught
little
more
than
a
passing
glimpse
of
something
dark
and
oddly
massed
where
moccasined
feet
ought
to
have
been
and
saw
even
that
but
with
uncertain
vision
then
before
the
doctor
had
time
to
do
more
or
simpson
time
to
even
think
a
question
much
less
ask
it
dã©fago
was
standing
upright
in
front
of
them
balancing
with
pain
and
difficulty
and
upon
his
shapeless
and
twisted
visage
an
expression
so
dark
and
so
malicious
that
it
was
in
the
true
sense
monstrous
now
you
seen
it
too
he
wheezed
you
seen
my
fiery
burning
feet
and
now--that
is
unless
you
kin
save
me
an'
prevent--it's
'bout
time
for--
his
piteous
and
beseeching
voice
was
interrupted
by
a
sound
that
was
like
the
roar
of
wind
coming
across
the
lake
the
trees
overhead
shook
their
tangled
branches
the
blazing
fire
bent
its
flames
as
before
a
blast
and
something
swept
with
a
terrific
rushing
noise
about
the
little
camp
and
seemed
to
surround
it
entirely
in
a
single
moment
of
time
dã©fago
shook
the
clinging
blankets
from
his
body
turned
towards
the
woods
behind
and
with
the
same
stumbling
motion
that
had
brought
him--was
gone
gone
before
anyone
could
move
muscle
to
prevent
him
gone
with
an
amazing
blundering
swiftness
that
left
no
time
to
act
the
darkness
positively
swallowed
him
and
less
than
a
dozen
seconds
later
above
the
roar
of
the
swaying
trees
and
the
shout
of
the
sudden
wind
all
three
men
watching
and
listening
with
stricken
hearts
heard
a
cry
that
seemed
to
drop
down
upon
them
from
a
great
height
of
sky
and
distance--
oh
oh
this
fiery
height
oh
oh
my
feet
of
fire
my
burning
feet
of
fire

then
died
away
into
untold
space
and
silence
dr
cathcart--suddenly
master
of
himself
and
therefore
of
the
others--was
just
able
to
seize
hank
violently
by
the
arm
as
he
tried
to
dash
headlong
into
the
bush
but
i
want
ter
know--you
shrieked
the
guide
i
want
ter
see
that
ain't
him
at
all
but
some--devil
that's
shunted
into
his
place

somehow
or
other--he
admits
he
never
quite
knew
how
he
accomplished
it--he
managed
to
keep
him
in
the
tent
and
pacify
him
the
doctor
apparently
had
reached
the
stage
where
reaction
had
set
in
and
allowed
his
own
innate
force
to
conquer
certainly
he
managed
hank
admirably
it
was
his
nephew
however
hitherto
so
wonderfully
controlled
who
gave
him
most
cause
for
anxiety
for
the
cumulative
strain
had
now
produced
a
condition
of
lachrymose
hysteria
which
made
it
necessary
to
isolate
him
upon
a
bed
of
boughs
and
blankets
as
far
removed
from
hank
as
was
possible
under
the
circumstances
and
there
he
lay
as
the
watches
of
that
haunted
night
passed
over
the
lonely
camp
crying
startled
sentences
and
fragments
of
sentences
into
the
folds
of
his
blanket
a
quantity
of
gibberish
about
speed
and
height
and
fire
mingled
oddly
with
biblical
memories
of
the
classroom
people
with
broken
faces
all
on
fire
are
coming
at
a
most
awful
awful
pace
towards
the
camp
he
would
moan
one
minute
and
the
next
would
sit
up
and
stare
into
the
woods
intently
listening
and
whisper
how
terrible
in
the
wilderness
are--are
the
feet
of
them
that--
until
his
uncle
came
across
to
change
the
direction
of
his
thoughts
and
comfort
him
the
hysteria
fortunately
proved
but
temporary
sleep
cured
him
just
as
it
cured
hank
till
the
first
signs
of
daylight
came
soon
after
five
o'clock
dr
cathcart
kept
his
vigil
his
face
was
the
color
of
chalk
and
there
were
strange
flushes
beneath
the
eyes
an
appalling
terror
of
the
soul
battled
with
his
will
all
through
those
silent
hours
these
were
some
of
the
outer
signs

at
dawn
he
lit
the
fire
himself
made
breakfast
and
woke
the
others
and
by
seven
they
were
well
on
their
way
back
to
the
home
camp--three
perplexed
and
afflicted
men
but
each
in
his
own
way
having
reduced
his
inner
turmoil
to
a
condition
of
more
or
less
systematized
order
again
ix
they
talked
little
and
then
only
of
the
most
wholesome
and
common
things
for
their
minds
were
charged
with
painful
thoughts
that
clamoured
for
explanation
though
no
one
dared
refer
to
them
hank
being
nearest
to
primitive
conditions
was
the
first
to
find
himself
for
he
was
also
less
complex
in
dr
cathcart
civilization
championed
his
forces
against
an
attack
singular
enough
to
this
day
perhaps
he
is
not
quite
sure
of
certain
things
anyhow
he
took
longer
to
find
himself
simpson
the
student
of
divinity
it
was
who
arranged
his
conclusions
probably
with
the
best
though
not
most
scientific
appearance
of
order
out
there
in
the
heart
of
unreclaimed
wilderness
they
had
surely
witnessed
something
crudely
and
essentially
primitive
something
that
had
survived
somehow
the
advance
of
humanity
had
emerged
terrifically
betraying
a
scale
of
life
still
monstrous
and
immature
he
envisaged
it
rather
as
a
glimpse
into
prehistoric
ages
when
superstitions
gigantic
and
uncouth
still
oppressed
the
hearts
of
men
when
the
forces
of
nature
were
still
untamed
the
powers
that
may
have
haunted
a
primeval
universe
not
yet
withdrawn
to
this
day
he
thinks
of
what
he
termed
years
later
in
a
sermon
savage
and
formidable
potencies
lurking
behind
the
souls
of
men
not
evil
perhaps
in
themselves
yet
instinctively
hostile
to
humanity
as
it
exists
with
his
uncle
he
never
discussed
the
matter
in
detail
for
the
barrier
between
the
two
types
of
mind
made
it
difficult
only
once
years
later
something
led
them
to
the
frontier
of
the
subject--of
a
single
detail
of
the
subject
rather--
can't
you
even
tell
me
what--they
were
like
he
asked
and
the
reply
though
conceived
in
wisdom
was
not
encouraging
it
is
far
better
you
should
not
try
to
know
or
to
find
out
well--that
odour
persisted
the
nephew
what
do
you
make
of
that
dr
cathcart
looked
at
him
and
raised
his
eyebrows
odours
he
replied
are
not
so
easy
as
sounds
and
sights
of
telepathic
communication
i
make
as
much
or
as
little
probably
as
you
do
yourself
he
was
not
quite
so
glib
as
usual
with
his
explanations
that
was
all





at
the
fall
of
day
cold
exhausted
famished
the
party
came
to
the
end
of
the
long
portage
and
dragged
themselves
into
a
camp
that
at
first
glimpse
seemed
empty
fire
there
was
none
and
no
punk
came
forward
to
welcome
them
the
emotional
capacity
of
all
three
was
too
over-spent
to
recognize
either
surprise
or
annoyance
but
the
cry
of
spontaneous
affection
that
burst
from
the
lips
of
hank
as
he
rushed
ahead
of
them
towards
the
fire-place
came
probably
as
a
warning
that
the
end
of
the
amazing
affair
was
not
quite
yet
and
both
cathcart
and
his
nephew
confessed
afterwards
that
when
they
saw
him
kneel
down
in
his
excitement
and
embrace
something
that
reclined
gently
moving
beside
the
extinguished
ashes
they
felt
in
their
very
bones
that
this
something
would
prove
to
be
dã©fago--the
true
dã©fago
returned
and
so
indeed
it
was
it
is
soon
told
exhausted
to
the
point
of
emaciation
the
french
canadian--what
was
left
of
him
that
is--fumbled
among
the
ashes
trying
to
make
a
fire
his
body
crouched
there
the
weak
fingers
obeying
feebly
the
instinctive
habit
of
a
lifetime
with
twigs
and
matches
but
there
was
no
longer
any
mind
to
direct
the
simple
operation
the
mind
had
fled
beyond
recall
and
with
it
too
had
fled
memory
not
only
recent
events
but
all
previous
life
was
a
blank
this
time
it
was
the
real
man
though
incredibly
and
horribly
shrunken
on
his
face
was
no
expression
of
any
kind
whatever--fear
welcome
or
recognition
he
did
not
seem
to
know
who
it
was
that
embraced
him
or
who
it
was
that
fed
warmed
and
spoke
to
him
the
words
of
comfort
and
relief
forlorn
and
broken
beyond
all
reach
of
human
aid
the
little
man
did
meekly
as
he
was
bidden
the
something
that
had
constituted
him
individual
had
vanished
for
ever
in
some
ways
it
was
more
terribly
moving
than
anything
they
had
yet
seen--that
idiot
smile
as
he
drew
wads
of
coarse
moss
from
his
swollen
cheeks
and
told
them
that
he
was
a
damned
moss-eater
the
continued
vomiting
of
even
the
simplest
food
and
worst
of
all
the
piteous
and
childish
voice
of
complaint
in
which
he
told
them
that
his
feet
pained
him--burn
like
fire--which
was
natural
enough
when
dr
cathcart
examined
them
and
found
that
both
were
dreadfully
frozen
beneath
the
eyes
there
were
faint
indications
of
recent
bleeding
the
details
of
how
he
survived
the
prolonged
exposure
of
where
he
had
been
or
of
how
he
covered
the
great
distance
from
one
camp
to
the
other
including
an
immense
detour
of
the
lake
on
foot
since
he
had
no
canoe--all
this
remains
unknown
his
memory
had
vanished
completely
and
before
the
end
of
the
winter
whose
beginning
witnessed
this
strange
occurrence
dã©fago
bereft
of
mind
memory
and
soul
had
gone
with
it
he
lingered
only
a
few
weeks
and
what
punk
was
able
to
contribute
to
the
story
throws
no
further
light
upon
it
he
was
cleaning
fish
by
the
lake
shore
about
five
o'clock
in
the
evening--an
hour
that
is
before
the
search
party
returned--when
he
saw
this
shadow
of
the
guide
picking
its
way
weakly
into
camp
in
advance
of
him
he
declares
came
the
faint
whiff
of
a
certain
singular
odour
that
same
instant
old
punk
started
for
home
he
covered
the
entire
journey
of
three
days
as
only
indian
blood
could
have
covered
it
the
terror
of
a
whole
race
drove
him
he
knew
what
it
all
meant
