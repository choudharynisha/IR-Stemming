the
evils
of
pestilence
by
which
this
city
has
lately
been
afflicted
will
probably
form
an
era
in
its
history
the
schemes
of
reformation
and
improvement
to
which
they
will
give
birth
or
if
no
efforts
of
human
wisdom
can
avail
to
avert
the
periodical
visitations
of
this
calamity
the
change
in
manners
and
population
which
they
will
produce
will
be
in
the
highest
degree
memorable
they
have
already
supplied
new
and
copious
materials
for
reflection
to
the
physician
and
the
political
economist
they
have
not
been
less
fertile
of
instruction
to
the
moral
observer
to
whom
they
have
furnished
new
displays
of
the
influence
of
human
passions
and
motives
amidst
the
medical
and
political
discussions
which
are
now
afloat
in
the
community
relative
to
this
topic
the
author
of
these
remarks
has
ventured
to
methodize
his
own
reflections
and
to
weave
into
an
humble
narrative
such
incidents
as
appeared
to
him
most
instructive
and
remarkable
among
those
which
came
within
the
sphere
of
his
own
observation
it
is
every
one's
duty
to
profit
by
all
opportunities
of
inculcating
on
mankind
the
lessons
of
justice
and
humanity
the
influences
of
hope
and
fear
the
trials
of
fortitude
and
constancy
which
took
place
in
this
city
in
the
autumn
of
1793
have
perhaps
never
been
exceeded
in
any
age
it
is
but
just
to
snatch
some
of
these
from
oblivion
and
to
deliver
to
posterity
a
brief
but
faithful
sketch
of
the
condition
of
this
metropolis
during
that
calamitous
period
men
only
require
to
be
made
acquainted
with
distress
for
their
compassion
and
their
charity
to
be
awakened
he
that
depicts
in
lively
colours
the
evils
of
disease
and
poverty
performs
an
eminent
service
to
the
sufferers
by
calling
forth
benevolence
in
those
who
are
able
to
afford
relief
and
he
who
portrays
examples
of
disinterestedness
and
intrepidity
confers
on
virtue
the
notoriety
and
homage
that
are
due
to
it
and
rouses
in
the
spectators
the
spirit
of
salutary
emulation
in
the
following
tale
a
particular
series
of
adventures
is
brought
to
a
close
but
these
are
necessarily
connected
with
the
events
which
happened
subsequent
to
the
period
here
described
these
events
are
not
less
memorable
than
those
which
form
the
subject
of
the
present
volume
and
may
hereafter
be
published
either
separately
or
in
addition
to
this
cbb
arthur
mervyn
i
was
resident
in
this
city
during
the
year
1793
many
motives
contributed
to
detain
me
though
departure
was
easy
and
commodious
and
my
friends
were
generally
solicitous
for
me
to
go
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
enumerate
these
motives
or
to
dwell
on
my
present
concerns
and
transactions
but
merely
to
compose
a
narrative
of
some
incidents
with
which
my
situation
made
me
acquainted
returning
one
evening
somewhat
later
than
usual
to
my
own
house
my
attention
was
attracted
just
as
i
entered
the
porch
by
the
figure
of
a
man
reclining
against
the
wall
at
a
few
paces
distant
my
sight
was
imperfectly
assisted
by
a
far-off
lamp
but
the
posture
in
which
he
sat
the
hour
and
the
place
immediately
suggested
the
idea
of
one
disabled
by
sickness
it
was
obvious
to
conclude
that
his
disease
was
pestilential
this
did
not
deter
me
from
approaching
and
examining
him
more
closely
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
wall
his
eyes
were
shut
his
hands
clasped
in
each
other
and
his
body
seemed
to
be
sustained
in
an
upright
position
merely
by
the
cellar-door
against
which
he
rested
his
left
shoulder
the
lethargy
into
which
he
was
sunk
seemed
scarcely
interrupted
by
my
feeling
his
hand
and
his
forehead
his
throbbing
temples
and
burning
skin
indicated
a
fever
and
his
form
already
emaciated
seemed
to
prove
that
it
had
not
been
of
short
duration
there
was
only
one
circumstance
that
hindered
me
from
forming
an
immediate
determination
in
what
manner
this
person
should
be
treated
my
family
consisted
of
my
wife
and
a
young
child
our
servant-maid
had
been
seized
three
days
before
by
the
reigning
malady
and
at
her
own
request
had
been
conveyed
to
the
hospital
we
ourselves
enjoyed
good
health
and
were
hopeful
of
escaping
with
our
lives
our
measures
for
this
end
had
been
cautiously
taken
and
carefully
adhered
to
they
did
not
consist
in
avoiding
the
receptacles
of
infection
for
my
office
required
me
to
go
daily
into
the
midst
of
them
nor
in
filling
the
house
with
the
exhalations
of
gunpowder
vinegar
or
tar
they
consisted
in
cleanliness
reasonable
exercise
and
wholesome
diet
custom
had
likewise
blunted
the
edge
of
our
apprehensions
to
take
this
person
into
my
house
and
bestow
upon
him
the
requisite
attendance
was
the
scheme
that
first
occurred
to
me
in
this
however
the
advice
of
my
wife
was
to
govern
me
i
mentioned
the
incident
to
her
i
pointed
out
the
danger
which
was
to
be
dreaded
from
such
an
inmate
i
desired
her
to
decide
with
caution
and
mentioned
my
resolution
to
conform
myself
implicitly
to
her
decision
should
we
refuse
to
harbour
him
we
must
not
forget
that
there
was
a
hospital
to
which
he
would
perhaps
consent
to
be
carried
and
where
he
would
be
accommodated
in
the
best
manner
the
times
would
admit
nay
said
she
talk
not
of
hospitals
at
least
let
him
have
his
choice
i
have
no
fear
about
me
for
my
part
in
a
case
where
the
injunctions
of
duty
are
so
obvious
let
us
take
the
poor
unfortunate
wretch
into
our
protection
and
care
and
leave
the
consequences
to
heaven
i
expected
and
was
pleased
with
this
proposal
i
returned
to
the
sick
man
and
on
rousing
him
from
his
stupor
found
him
still
in
possession
of
his
reason
with
a
candle
near
i
had
an
opportunity
of
viewing
him
more
accurately
his
garb
was
plain
careless
and
denoted
rusticity
his
aspect
was
simple
and
ingenuous
and
his
decayed
visage
still
retained
traces
of
uncommon
but
manlike
beauty
he
had
all
the
appearances
of
mere
youth
unspoiled
by
luxury
and
uninured
to
misfortune
i
scarcely
ever
beheld
an
object
which
laid
so
powerful
and
sudden
a
claim
to
my
affection
and
succour
you
are
sick
said
i
in
as
cheerful
a
tone
as
i
could
assume
cold
bricks
and
night-airs
are
comfortless
attendants
for
one
in
your
condition
rise
i
pray
you
and
come
into
the
house
we
will
try
to
supply
you
with
accommodations
a
little
more
suitable
at
this
address
he
fixed
his
languid
eyes
upon
me
what
would
you
have
said
he
i
am
very
well
as
i
am
while
i
breathe
which
will
not
be
long
i
shall
breathe
with
more
freedom
here
than
elsewhere
let
me
alone--i
am
very
well
as
i
am
nay
said
i
this
situation
is
unsuitable
to
a
sick
man
i
only
ask
you
to
come
into
my
house
and
receive
all
the
kindness
that
it
is
in
our
power
to
bestow
pluck
up
courage
and
i
will
answer
for
your
recovery
provided
you
submit
to
directions
and
do
as
we
would
have
you
rise
and
come
along
with
me
we
will
find
you
a
physician
and
a
nurse
and
all
we
ask
in
return
is
good
spirits
and
compliance
do
you
not
know
he
replied
what
my
disease
is
why
should
you
risk
your
safety
for
the
sake
of
one
whom
your
kindness
cannot
benefit
and
who
has
nothing
to
give
in
return
there
was
something
in
the
style
of
this
remark
that
heightened
my
prepossession
in
his
favour
and
made
me
pursue
my
purpose
with
more
zeal
let
us
try
what
we
can
do
for
you
i
answered
if
we
save
your
life
we
shall
have
done
you
some
service
and
as
for
recompense
we
will
look
to
that
it
was
with
considerable
difficulty
that
he
was
persuaded
to
accept
our
invitation
he
was
conducted
to
a
chamber
and
the
criticalness
of
his
case
requiring
unusual
attention
i
spent
the
night
at
his
bedside
my
wife
was
encumbered
with
the
care
both
of
her
infant
and
her
family
the
charming
babe
was
in
perfect
health
but
her
mother's
constitution
was
frail
and
delicate
we
simplified
the
household
duties
as
much
as
possible
but
still
these
duties
were
considerably
burdensome
to
one
not
used
to
the
performance
and
luxuriously
educated
the
addition
of
a
sick
man
was
likely
to
be
productive
of
much
fatigue
my
engagements
would
not
allow
me
to
be
always
at
home
and
the
state
of
my
patient
and
the
remedies
necessary
to
be
prescribed
were
attended
with
many
noxious
and
disgustful
circumstances
my
fortune
would
not
allow
me
to
hire
assistance
my
wife
with
a
feeble
frame
and
a
mind
shrinking
on
ordinary
occasions
from
such
offices
with
fastidious
scrupulousness
was
to
be
his
only
or
principal
nurse
my
neighbours
were
fervent
in
their
well-meant
zeal
and
loud
in
their
remonstrances
on
the
imprudence
and
rashness
of
my
conduct
they
called
me
presumptuous
and
cruel
in
exposing
my
wife
and
child
as
well
as
myself
to
such
imminent
hazard
for
the
sake
of
one
too
who
most
probably
was
worthless
and
whose
disease
had
doubtless
been
by
negligence
or
mistreatment
rendered
incurable
i
did
not
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
these
censurers
i
was
aware
of
all
the
inconveniences
and
perils
to
which
i
thus
spontaneously
exposed
myself
no
one
knew
better
the
value
of
that
woman
whom
i
called
mine
or
set
a
higher
price
upon
her
life
her
health
and
her
ease
the
virulence
and
activity
of
this
contagion
the
dangerous
condition
of
my
patient
and
the
dubiousness
of
his
character
were
not
forgotten
by
me
but
still
my
conduct
in
this
affair
received
my
own
entire
approbation
all
objections
on
the
score
of
my
friends
were
removed
by
her
own
willingness
and
even
solicitude
to
undertake
the
province
i
had
more
confidence
than
others
in
the
vincibility
of
this
disease
and
in
the
success
of
those
measures
which
we
had
used
for
our
defence
against
it
but
whatever
were
the
evils
to
accrue
to
us
we
were
sure
of
one
thing
namely
that
the
consciousness
of
having
neglected
this
unfortunate
person
would
be
a
source
of
more
unhappiness
than
could
possibly
redound
from
the
attendance
and
care
that
he
would
claim
the
more
we
saw
of
him
indeed
the
more
did
we
congratulate
ourselves
on
our
proceeding
his
torments
were
acute
and
tedious
but
in
the
midst
even
of
delirium
his
heart
seemed
to
overflow
with
gratitude
and
to
be
actuated
by
no
wish
but
to
alleviate
our
toil
and
our
danger
he
made
prodigious
exertions
to
perform
necessary
offices
for
himself
he
suppressed
his
feelings
and
struggled
to
maintain
a
cheerful
tone
and
countenance
that
he
might
prevent
that
anxiety
which
the
sight
of
his
sufferings
produced
in
us
he
was
perpetually
furnishing
reasons
why
his
nurse
should
leave
him
alone
and
betrayed
dissatisfaction
whenever
she
entered
his
apartment
in
a
few
days
there
were
reasons
to
conclude
him
out
of
danger
and
in
a
fortnight
nothing
but
exercise
and
nourishment
were
wanting
to
complete
his
restoration
meanwhile
nothing
was
obtained
from
him
but
general
information
that
his
place
of
abode
was
chester
county
and
that
some
momentous
engagement
induced
him
to
hazard
his
safety
by
coming
to
the
city
in
the
height
of
the
epidemic
he
was
far
from
being
talkative
his
silence
seemed
to
be
the
joint
result
of
modesty
and
unpleasing
remembrances
his
features
were
characterized
by
pathetic
seriousness
and
his
deportment
by
a
gravity
very
unusual
at
his
age
according
to
his
own
representation
he
was
no
more
than
eighteen
years
old
but
the
depth
of
his
remarks
indicated
a
much
greater
advance
his
name
was
arthur
mervyn
he
described
himself
as
having
passed
his
life
at
the
plough-tail
and
the
threshing-floor
as
being
destitute
of
all
scholastic
instruction
and
as
being
long
since
bereft
of
the
affectionate
regards
of
parents
and
kinsmen
when
questioned
as
to
the
course
of
life
which
he
meant
to
pursue
upon
his
recovery
he
professed
himself
without
any
precise
object
he
was
willing
to
be
guided
by
the
advice
of
others
and
by
the
lights
which
experience
should
furnish
the
country
was
open
to
him
and
he
supposed
that
there
was
no
part
of
it
in
which
food
could
not
be
purchased
by
his
labour
he
was
unqualified
by
his
education
for
any
liberal
profession
his
poverty
was
likewise
an
insuperable
impediment
he
could
afford
to
spend
no
time
in
the
acquisition
of
a
trade
he
must
labour
not
for
future
emolument
but
for
immediate
subsistence
the
only
pursuit
which
his
present
circumstances
would
allow
him
to
adopt
was
that
which
he
was
inclined
to
believe
was
likewise
the
most
eligible
without
doubt
his
experience
was
slender
and
it
seemed
absurd
to
pronounce
concerning
that
of
which
he
had
no
direct
knowledge
but
so
it
was
he
could
not
outroot
from
his
mind
the
persuasion
that
to
plough
to
sow
and
to
reap
were
employments
most
befitting
a
reasonable
creature
and
from
which
the
truest
pleasure
and
the
least
pollution
would
flow
he
contemplated
no
other
scheme
than
to
return
as
soon
as
his
health
should
permit
into
the
country
seek
employment
where
it
was
to
be
had
and
acquit
himself
in
his
engagements
with
fidelity
and
diligence
i
pointed
out
to
him
various
ways
in
which
the
city
might
furnish
employment
to
one
with
his
qualifications
he
had
said
that
he
was
somewhat
accustomed
to
the
pen
there
were
stations
in
which
the
possession
of
a
legible
hand
was
all
that
was
requisite
he
might
add
to
this
a
knowledge
of
accounts
and
thereby
procure
himself
a
post
in
some
mercantile
or
public
office
to
this
he
objected
that
experience
had
shown
him
unfit
for
the
life
of
a
penman
this
had
been
his
chief
occupation
for
a
little
while
and
he
found
it
wholly
incompatible
with
his
health
he
must
not
sacrifice
the
end
for
the
means
starving
was
a
disease
preferable
to
consumption
besides
he
laboured
merely
for
the
sake
of
living
and
he
lived
merely
for
the
sake
of
pleasure
if
his
tasks
should
enable
him
to
live
but
at
the
same
time
bereave
him
of
all
satisfaction
they
inflicted
injury
and
were
to
be
shunned
as
worse
evils
than
death
i
asked
to
what
species
of
pleasure
he
alluded
with
which
the
business
of
a
clerk
was
inconsistent
he
answered
that
he
scarcely
knew
how
to
describe
it
he
read
books
when
they
came
in
his
way
he
had
lighted
upon
few
and
perhaps
the
pleasure
they
afforded
him
was
owing
to
their
fewness
yet
he
confessed
that
a
mode
of
life
which
entirely
forbade
him
to
read
was
by
no
means
to
his
taste
but
this
was
trivial
he
knew
how
to
value
the
thoughts
of
other
people
but
he
could
not
part
with
the
privilege
of
observing
and
thinking
for
himself
he
wanted
business
which
would
suffer
at
least
nine-tenths
of
his
attention
to
go
free
if
it
afforded
agreeable
employment
to
that
part
of
his
attention
which
it
applied
to
its
own
use
so
much
the
better
but
if
it
did
not
he
should
not
repine
he
should
be
content
with
a
life
whose
pleasures
were
to
its
pains
as
nine
are
to
one
he
had
tried
the
trade
of
a
copyist
and
in
circumstances
more
favourable
than
it
was
likely
he
should
ever
again
have
an
opportunity
of
trying
it
and
he
had
found
that
it
did
not
fulfil
the
requisite
conditions
whereas
the
trade
of
ploughman
was
friendly
to
health
liberty
and
pleasure
the
pestilence
if
it
may
so
be
called
was
now
declining
the
health
of
my
young
friend
allowed
him
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
and
to
walk
a
friend
of
mine
by
name
wortley
who
had
spent
two
months
from
the
city
and
to
whom
in
the
course
of
a
familiar
correspondence
i
had
mentioned
the
foregoing
particulars
returned
from
his
rural
excursion
he
was
posting
on
the
evening
of
the
day
of
his
arrival
with
a
friendly
expedition
to
my
house
when
he
overtook
mervyn
going
in
the
same
direction
he
was
surprised
to
find
him
go
before
him
into
my
dwelling
and
to
discover
which
he
speedily
did
that
this
was
the
youth
whom
i
had
so
frequently
mentioned
to
him
i
was
present
at
their
meeting
there
was
a
strange
mixture
in
the
countenance
of
wortley
when
they
were
presented
to
each
other
his
satisfaction
was
mingled
with
surprise
and
his
surprise
with
anger
mervyn
in
his
turn
betrayed
considerable
embarrassment
wortley's
thoughts
were
too
earnest
on
some
topic
to
allow
him
to
converse
he
shortly
made
some
excuse
for
taking
leave
and
rising
addressed
himself
to
the
youth
with
a
request
that
he
would
walk
home
with
him
this
invitation
delivered
in
a
tone
which
left
it
doubtful
whether
a
compliment
or
menace
were
meant
augmented
mervyn's
confusion
he
complied
without
speaking
and
they
went
out
together--my
wife
and
i
were
left
to
comment
upon
the
scene
it
could
not
fail
to
excite
uneasiness
they
were
evidently
no
strangers
to
each
other
the
indignation
that
flashed
from
the
eyes
of
wortley
and
the
trembling
consciousness
of
mervyn
were
unwelcome
tokens
the
former
was
my
dearest
friend
and
venerable
for
his
discernment
and
integrity
the
latter
appeared
to
have
drawn
upon
himself
the
anger
and
disdain
of
this
man
we
already
anticipated
the
shock
which
the
discovery
of
his
unworthiness
would
produce
in
a
half-hour
mervyn
returned
his
embarrassment
had
given
place
to
dejection
he
was
always
serious
but
his
features
were
now
overcast
by
the
deepest
gloom
the
anxiety
which
i
felt
would
not
allow
me
to
hesitate
long
arthur
said
i
something
is
the
matter
with
you
will
you
not
disclose
it
to
us
perhaps
you
have
brought
yourself
into
some
dilemma
out
of
which
we
may
help
you
to
escape
has
any
thing
of
an
unpleasant
nature
passed
between
you
and
wortley
the
youth
did
not
readily
answer
he
seemed
at
a
loss
for
a
suitable
reply
at
length
he
said
that
something
disagreeable
had
indeed
passed
between
him
and
wortley
he
had
had
the
misfortune
to
be
connected
with
a
man
by
whom
wortley
conceived
himself
to
be
injured
he
had
borne
no
part
in
inflicting
this
injury
but
had
nevertheless
been
threatened
with
ill
treatment
if
he
did
not
make
disclosures
which
indeed
it
was
in
his
power
to
make
but
which
he
was
bound
by
every
sanction
to
withhold
this
disclosure
would
be
of
no
benefit
to
wortley
it
would
rather
operate
injuriously
than
otherwise
yet
it
was
endeavoured
to
be
wrested
from
him
by
the
heaviest
menaces
there
he
paused
we
were
naturally
inquisitive
as
to
the
scope
of
these
menaces
but
mervyn
entreated
us
to
forbear
any
further
discussion
of
this
topic
he
foresaw
the
difficulties
to
which
his
silence
would
subject
him
one
of
its
most
fearful
consequences
would
be
the
loss
of
our
good
opinion
he
knew
not
what
he
had
to
dread
from
the
enmity
of
wortley
mr
wortley's
violence
was
not
without
excuse
it
was
his
mishap
to
be
exposed
to
suspicions
which
could
only
be
obviated
by
breaking
his
faith
but
indeed
he
knew
not
whether
any
degree
of
explicitness
would
confute
the
charges
that
were
made
against
him
whether
by
trampling
on
his
sacred
promise
he
should
not
multiply
his
perils
instead
of
lessening
their
number
a
difficult
part
had
been
assigned
to
him
by
much
too
difficult
for
one
young
improvident
and
inexperienced
as
he
was
sincerity
perhaps
was
the
best
course
perhaps
after
having
had
an
opportunity
for
deliberation
he
should
conclude
to
adopt
it
meanwhile
he
entreated
permission
to
retire
to
his
chamber
he
was
unable
to
exclude
from
his
mind
ideas
which
yet
could
with
no
propriety
at
least
at
present
be
made
the
theme
of
conversation
these
words
were
accompanied
with
simplicity
and
pathos
and
with
tokens
of
unaffected
distress
arthur
said
i
you
are
master
of
your
actions
and
time
in
this
house
retire
when
you
please
but
you
will
naturally
suppose
us
anxious
to
dispel
this
mystery
whatever
shall
tend
to
obscure
or
malign
your
character
will
of
course
excite
our
solicitude
wortley
is
not
short-sighted
or
hasty
to
condemn
so
great
is
my
confidence
in
his
integrity
that
i
will
not
promise
my
esteem
to
one
who
has
irrecoverably
lost
that
of
wortley
i
am
not
acquainted
with
your
motives
to
concealment
or
what
it
is
you
conceal
but
take
the
word
of
one
who
possesses
that
experience
which
you
complain
of
wanting
that
sincerity
is
always
safest
as
soon
as
he
had
retired
my
curiosity
prompted
me
to
pay
an
immediate
visit
to
wortley
i
found
him
at
home
he
was
no
less
desirous
of
an
interview
and
answered
my
inquiries
with
as
much
eagerness
as
they
were
made
you
know
said
he
my
disastrous
connection
with
thomas
welbeck
you
recollect
his
sudden
disappearance
last
july
by
which
i
was
reduced
to
the
brink
of
ruin
nay
i
am
even
now
far
from
certain
that
i
shall
survive
that
event
i
spoke
to
you
about
the
youth
who
lived
with
him
and
by
what
means
that
youth
was
discovered
to
have
crossed
the
river
in
his
company
on
the
night
of
his
departure
this
is
that
very
youth
this
will
account
for
my
emotion
at
meeting
him
at
your
house
i
brought
him
out
with
me
his
confusion
sufficiently
indicated
his
knowledge
of
transactions
between
welbeck
and
me
i
questioned
him
as
to
the
fate
of
that
man
to
own
the
truth
i
expected
some
well-digested
lie
but
he
merely
said
that
he
had
promised
secrecy
on
that
subject
and
must
therefore
be
excused
from
giving
me
any
information
i
asked
him
if
he
knew
that
his
master
or
accomplice
or
whatever
was
his
relation
to
him
absconded
in
my
debt
he
answered
that
he
knew
it
well
but
still
pleaded
a
promise
of
inviolable
secrecy
as
to
his
hiding-place
this
conduct
justly
exasperated
me
and
i
treated
him
with
the
severity
which
he
deserved
i
am
half
ashamed
to
confess
the
excesses
of
my
passion
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
strike
him
he
bore
my
insults
with
the
utmost
patience
no
doubt
the
young
villain
is
well
instructed
in
his
lesson
he
knows
that
he
may
safely
defy
my
power
from
threats
i
descended
to
entreaties
i
even
endeavoured
to
wind
the
truth
from
him
by
artifice
i
promised
him
a
part
of
the
debt
if
he
would
enable
me
to
recover
the
whole
i
offered
him
a
considerable
reward
if
he
would
merely
afford
me
a
clue
by
which
i
might
trace
him
to
his
retreat
but
all
was
insufficient
he
merely
put
on
an
air
of
perplexity
and
shook
his
head
in
token
of
non-compliance
such
was
my
friend's
account
of
this
interview
his
suspicions
were
unquestionably
plausible
but
i
was
disposed
to
put
a
more
favourable
construction
on
mervyn's
behaviour
i
recollected
the
desolate
and
penniless
condition
in
which
i
found
him
and
the
uniform
complacency
and
rectitude
of
his
deportment
for
the
period
during
which
we
had
witnessed
it
these
ideas
had
considerable
influence
on
my
judgment
and
indisposed
me
to
follow
the
advice
of
my
friend
which
was
to
turn
him
forth
from
my
doors
that
very
night
my
wife's
prepossessions
were
still
more
powerful
advocates
of
this
youth
she
would
vouch
she
said
before
any
tribunal
for
his
innocence
but
she
willingly
concurred
with
me
in
allowing
him
the
continuance
of
our
friendship
on
no
other
condition
than
that
of
a
disclosure
of
the
truth
to
entitle
ourselves
to
this
confidence
we
were
willing
to
engage
in
our
turn
for
the
observance
of
secrecy
so
far
that
no
detriment
should
accrue
from
this
disclosure
to
himself
or
his
friend
next
morning
at
breakfast
our
guest
appeared
with
a
countenance
less
expressive
of
embarrassment
than
on
the
last
evening
his
attention
was
chiefly
engaged
by
his
own
thoughts
and
little
was
said
till
the
breakfast
was
removed
i
then
reminded
him
of
the
incidents
of
the
former
day
and
mentioned
that
the
uneasiness
which
thence
arose
to
us
had
rather
been
increased
than
diminished
by
time
it
is
in
your
power
my
young
friend
continued
i
to
add
still
more
to
this
uneasiness
or
to
take
it
entirely
away
i
had
no
personal
acquaintance
with
thomas
welbeck
i
have
been
informed
by
others
that
his
character
for
a
certain
period
was
respectable
but
that
at
length
he
contracted
large
debts
and
instead
of
paying
them
absconded
you
it
seems
lived
with
him
on
the
night
of
his
departure
you
are
known
to
have
accompanied
him
across
the
river
and
this
it
seems
is
the
first
of
your
reappearance
on
the
stage
welbeck's
conduct
was
dishonest
he
ought
doubtless
to
be
pursued
to
his
asylum
and
be
compelled
to
refund
his
winnings
you
confess
yourself
to
know
his
place
of
refuge
but
urge
a
promise
of
secrecy
know
you
not
that
to
assist
or
connive
at
the
escape
of
this
man
was
wrong
to
have
promised
to
favour
his
concealment
and
impunity
by
silence
was
only
an
aggravation
of
this
wrong
that
however
is
past
your
youth
and
circumstances
hitherto
unexplained
may
apologize
for
that
misconduct
but
it
is
certainly
your
duty
to
repair
it
to
the
utmost
of
your
power
think
whether
by
disclosing
what
you
know
you
will
not
repair
it
i
have
spent
most
of
last
night
said
the
youth
in
reflecting
on
this
subject
i
had
come
to
a
resolution
before
you
spoke
of
confiding
to
you
my
simple
tale
i
perceive
in
what
circumstances
i
am
placed
and
that
i
can
keep
my
hold
of
your
good
opinion
only
by
a
candid
deportment
i
have
indeed
given
a
promise
which
it
was
wrong
or
rather
absurd
in
another
to
exact
and
in
me
to
give
yet
none
but
considerations
of
the
highest
importance
would
persuade
me
to
break
my
promise
no
injury
will
accrue
from
my
disclosure
to
welbeck
if
there
should
dishonest
as
he
was
that
would
be
a
sufficient
reason
for
my
silence
wortley
will
not
in
any
degree
be
benefited
by
any
communication
that
i
can
make
whether
i
grant
or
withhold
information
my
conduct
will
have
influence
only
on
my
own
happiness
and
that
influence
will
justify
me
in
granting
it
i
received
your
protection
when
i
was
friendless
and
forlorn
you
have
a
right
to
know
whom
it
is
that
you
protected
my
own
fate
is
connected
with
the
fate
of
welbeck
and
that
connection
together
with
the
interest
you
are
pleased
to
take
in
my
concerns
because
they
are
mine
will
render
a
tale
worthy
of
attention
which
will
not
be
recommended
by
variety
of
facts
or
skill
in
the
display
of
them
wortley
though
passionate
and
with
regard
to
me
unjust
may
yet
be
a
good
man
but
i
have
no
desire
to
make
him
one
of
my
auditors
you
sir
may
if
you
think
proper
relate
to
him
afterwards
what
particulars
concerning
welbeck
it
may
be
of
importance
for
him
to
know
but
at
present
it
will
be
well
if
your
indulgence
shall
support
me
to
the
end
of
a
tedious
but
humble
tale
the
eyes
of
my
eliza
sparkled
with
delight
at
this
proposal
she
regarded
this
youth
with
a
sisterly
affection
and
considered
his
candour
in
this
respect
as
an
unerring
test
of
his
rectitude
she
was
prepared
to
hear
and
to
forgive
the
errors
of
inexperience
and
precipitation
i
did
not
fully
participate
in
her
satisfaction
but
was
nevertheless
most
zealously
disposed
to
listen
to
his
narrative
my
engagements
obliged
me
to
postpone
this
rehearsal
till
late
in
the
evening
collected
then
round
a
cheerful
hearth
exempt
from
all
likelihood
of
interruption
from
without
and
our
babe's
unpractised
senses
shut
up
in
the
sweetest
and
profoundest
sleep
mervyn
after
a
pause
of
recollection
began
my
natal
soil
is
chester
county
my
father
had
a
small
farm
on
which
he
has
been
able
by
industry
to
maintain
himself
and
a
numerous
family
he
has
had
many
children
but
some
defect
in
the
constitution
of
our
mother
has
been
fatal
to
all
of
them
but
me
they
died
successively
as
they
attained
the
age
of
nineteen
or
twenty
and
since
i
have
not
yet
reached
that
age
i
may
reasonably
look
for
the
same
premature
fate
in
the
spring
of
last
year
my
mother
followed
her
fifth
child
to
the
grave
and
three
months
afterwards
died
herself
my
constitution
has
always
been
frail
and
till
the
death
of
my
mother
i
enjoyed
unlimited
indulgence
i
cheerfully
sustained
my
portion
of
labour
for
that
necessity
prescribed
but
the
intervals
were
always
at
my
own
disposal
and
in
whatever
manner
i
thought
proper
to
employ
them
my
plans
were
encouraged
and
assisted
fond
appellations
tones
of
mildness
solicitous
attendance
when
i
was
sick
deference
to
my
opinions
and
veneration
for
my
talents
compose
the
image
which
i
still
retain
of
my
mother
i
had
the
thoughtlessness
and
presumption
of
youth
and
now
that
she
is
gone
my
compunction
is
awakened
by
a
thousand
recollections
of
my
treatment
of
her
i
was
indeed
guilty
of
no
flagrant
acts
of
contempt
or
rebellion
perhaps
her
deportment
was
inevitably
calculated
to
instil
into
me
a
froward
and
refractory
spirit
my
faults
however
were
speedily
followed
by
repentance
and
in
the
midst
of
impatience
and
passion
a
look
of
tender
upbraiding
from
her
was
always
sufficient
to
melt
me
into
tears
and
make
me
ductile
to
her
will
if
sorrow
for
her
loss
be
an
atonement
for
the
offences
which
i
committed
during
her
life
ample
atonement
has
been
made
my
father
is
a
man
of
slender
capacity
but
of
a
temper
easy
and
flexible
he
was
sober
and
industrious
by
habit
he
was
content
to
be
guided
by
the
superior
intelligence
of
his
wife
under
this
guidance
he
prospered
but
when
that
was
withdrawn
his
affairs
soon
began
to
betray
marks
of
unskilfulness
and
negligence
my
understanding
perhaps
qualified
me
to
counsel
and
assist
my
father
but
i
was
wholly
unaccustomed
to
the
task
of
superintendence
besides
gentleness
and
fortitude
did
not
descend
to
me
from
my
mother
and
these
were
indispensable
attributes
in
a
boy
who
desires
to
dictate
to
his
gray-headed
parent
time
perhaps
might
have
conferred
dexterity
on
me
or
prudence
on
him
had
not
a
most
unexpected
event
given
a
different
direction
to
my
views
betty
lawrence
was
a
wild
girl
from
the
pine-forests
of
new
jersey
at
the
age
of
ten
years
she
became
a
bound
servant
in
this
city
and
after
the
expiration
of
her
time
came
into
my
father's
neighbourhood
in
search
of
employment
she
was
hired
in
our
family
as
milkmaid
and
market-woman
her
features
were
coarse
her
frame
robust
her
mind
totally
unlettered
and
her
morals
defective
in
that
point
in
which
female
excellence
is
supposed
chiefly
to
consist
she
possessed
super-abundant
health
and
good-humour
and
was
quite
a
supportable
companion
in
the
hay-field
or
the
barnyard
on
the
death
of
my
mother
she
was
exalted
to
a
somewhat
higher
station
the
same
tasks
fell
to
her
lot
but
the
time
and
manner
of
performing
them
were
in
some
degree
submitted
to
her
own
choice
the
cows
and
the
dairy
were
still
her
province
but
in
this
no
one
interfered
with
her
or
pretended
to
prescribe
her
measures
for
this
province
she
seemed
not
unqualified
and
as
long
as
my
father
was
pleased
with
her
management
i
had
nothing
to
object
this
state
of
things
continued
without
material
variation
for
several
months
there
were
appearances
in
my
father's
deportment
to
betty
which
excited
my
reflections
but
not
my
fears
the
deference
which
was
occasionally
paid
to
the
advice
or
the
claims
of
this
girl
was
accounted
for
by
that
feebleness
of
mind
which
degraded
my
father
in
whatever
scene
he
should
be
placed
to
be
the
tool
of
others
i
had
no
conception
that
her
claims
extended
beyond
a
temporary
or
superficial
gratification
at
length
however
a
visible
change
took
place
in
her
manners
a
scornful
affectation
and
awkward
dignity
began
to
be
assumed
a
greater
attention
was
paid
to
dress
which
was
of
gayer
hues
and
more
fashionable
texture
i
rallied
her
on
these
tokens
of
a
sweetheart
and
amused
myself
with
expatiating
to
her
on
the
qualifications
of
her
lover
a
clownish
fellow
was
frequently
her
visitant
his
attentions
did
not
appear
to
be
discouraged
he
therefore
was
readily
supposed
to
be
the
man
when
pointed
out
as
the
favourite
great
resentment
was
expressed
and
obscure
insinuations
were
made
that
her
aim
was
not
quite
so
low
as
that
these
denials
i
supposed
to
be
customary
on
such
occasions
and
considered
the
continuance
of
his
visits
as
a
sufficient
confutation
of
them
i
frequently
spoke
of
betty
her
newly-acquired
dignity
and
of
the
probable
cause
of
her
change
of
manners
to
my
father
when
this
theme
was
started
a
certain
coldness
and
reserve
overspread
his
features
he
dealt
in
monosyllables
and
either
laboured
to
change
the
subject
or
made
some
excuse
for
leaving
me
this
behaviour
though
it
occasioned
surprise
was
never
very
deeply
reflected
on
my
father
was
old
and
the
mournful
impressions
which
were
made
upon
him
by
the
death
of
his
wife
the
lapse
of
almost
half
a
year
seemed
scarcely
to
have
weakened
betty
had
chosen
her
partner
and
i
was
in
daily
expectation
of
receiving
a
summons
to
the
wedding
one
afternoon
this
girl
dressed
herself
in
the
gayest
manner
and
seemed
making
preparations
for
some
momentous
ceremony
my
father
had
directed
me
to
put
the
horse
to
the
chaise
on
my
inquiring
whither
he
was
going
he
answered
me
in
general
terms
that
he
had
some
business
at
a
few
miles'
distance
i
offered
to
go
in
his
stead
but
he
said
that
was
impossible
i
was
proceeding
to
ascertain
the
possibility
of
this
when
he
left
me
to
go
to
a
field
where
his
workmen
were
busy
directing
me
to
inform
him
when
the
chaise
was
ready
to
supply
his
place
while
absent
in
overlooking
the
workmen
this
office
was
performed
but
before
i
called
him
from
the
field
i
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
milkmaid
who
sat
on
a
bench
in
all
the
primness
of
expectation
and
decked
with
the
most
gaudy
plumage
i
rated
her
imaginary
lover
for
his
tardiness
and
vowed
eternal
hatred
to
them
both
for
not
making
me
a
bride's
attendant
she
listened
to
me
with
an
air
in
which
embarrassment
was
mingled
sometimes
with
exultation
and
sometimes
with
malice
i
left
her
at
length
and
returned
to
the
house
not
till
a
late
hour
as
soon
as
i
entered
my
father
presented
betty
to
me
as
his
wife
and
desired
she
might
receive
that
treatment
from
me
which
was
due
to
a
mother
it
was
not
till
after
repeated
and
solemn
declarations
from
both
of
them
that
i
was
prevailed
upon
to
credit
this
event
its
effect
upon
my
feelings
may
be
easily
conceived
i
knew
the
woman
to
be
rude
ignorant
and
licentious
had
i
suspected
this
event
i
might
have
fortified
my
father's
weakness
and
enabled
him
to
shun
the
gulf
to
which
he
was
tending
but
my
presumption
had
been
careless
of
the
danger
to
think
that
such
a
one
should
take
the
place
of
my
revered
mother
was
intolerable
to
treat
her
in
any
way
not
squaring
with
her
real
merits
to
hinder
anger
and
scorn
from
rising
at
the
sight
of
her
in
her
new
condition
was
not
in
my
power
to
be
degraded
to
the
rank
of
her
servant
to
become
the
sport
of
her
malice
and
her
artifices
was
not
to
be
endured
i
had
no
independent
provision
but
i
was
the
only
child
of
my
father
and
had
reasonably
hoped
to
succeed
to
his
patrimony
on
this
hope
i
had
built
a
thousand
agreeable
visions
i
had
meditated
innumerable
projects
which
the
possession
of
this
estate
would
enable
me
to
execute
i
had
no
wish
beyond
the
trade
of
agriculture
and
beyond
the
opulence
which
a
hundred
acres
would
give
these
visions
were
now
at
an
end
no
doubt
her
own
interest
would
be
to
this
woman
the
supreme
law
and
this
would
be
considered
as
irreconcilably
hostile
to
mine
my
father
would
easily
be
moulded
to
her
purpose
and
that
act
easily
extorted
from
him
which
should
reduce
me
to
beggary
she
had
a
gross
and
perverse
taste
she
had
a
numerous
kindred
indigent
and
hungry
on
these
his
substance
would
speedily
be
lavished
me
she
hated
because
she
was
conscious
of
having
injured
me
because
she
knew
that
i
held
her
in
contempt
and
because
i
had
detected
her
in
an
illicit
intercourse
with
the
son
of
a
neighbour
the
house
in
which
i
lived
was
no
longer
my
own
nor
even
my
father's
hitherto
i
had
thought
and
acted
in
it
with
the
freedom
of
a
master
but
now
i
was
become
in
my
own
conceptions
an
alien
and
an
enemy
to
the
roof
under
which
i
was
born
every
tie
which
had
bound
me
to
it
was
dissolved
or
converted
into
something
which
repelled
me
to
a
distance
from
it
i
was
a
guest
whose
presence
was
borne
with
anger
and
impatience
i
was
fully
impressed
with
the
necessity
of
removal
but
i
knew
not
whither
to
go
or
what
kind
of
subsistence
to
seek
my
father
had
been
a
scottish
emigrant
and
had
no
kindred
on
this
side
of
the
ocean
my
mother's
family
lived
in
new
hampshire
and
long
separation
had
extinguished
all
the
rights
of
relationship
in
her
offspring
tilling
the
earth
was
my
only
profession
and
to
profit
by
my
skill
in
it
it
would
be
necessary
to
become
a
day-labourer
in
the
service
of
strangers
but
this
was
a
destiny
to
which
i
who
had
so
long
enjoyed
the
pleasures
of
independence
and
command
could
not
suddenly
reconcile
myself
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
city
might
afford
me
an
asylum
a
short
day's
journey
would
transport
me
into
it
i
had
been
there
twice
or
thrice
in
my
life
but
only
for
a
few
hours
each
time
i
knew
not
a
human
face
and
was
a
stranger
to
its
modes
and
dangers
i
was
qualified
for
no
employment
compatible
with
a
town
life
but
that
of
the
pen
this
indeed
had
ever
been
a
favourite
tool
with
me
and
though
it
may
appear
somewhat
strange
it
is
no
less
true
that
i
had
had
nearly
as
much
practice
at
the
quill
as
at
the
mattock
but
the
sum
of
my
skill
lay
in
tracing
distinct
characters
i
had
used
it
merely
to
transcribe
what
others
had
written
or
to
give
form
to
my
own
conceptions
whether
the
city
would
afford
me
employment
as
a
mere
copyist
sufficiently
lucrative
was
a
point
on
which
i
possessed
no
means
of
information
my
determination
was
hastened
by
the
conduct
of
my
new
mother
my
conjectures
as
to
the
course
she
would
pursue
with
regard
to
me
had
not
been
erroneous
my
father's
deportment
in
a
short
time
grew
sullen
and
austere
directions
were
given
in
a
magisterial
tone
and
any
remissness
in
the
execution
of
his
orders
was
rebuked
with
an
air
of
authority
at
length
these
rebukes
were
followed
by
certain
intimations
that
i
was
now
old
enough
to
provide
for
myself
that
it
was
time
to
think
of
some
employment
by
which
i
might
secure
a
livelihood
that
it
was
a
shame
for
me
to
spend
my
youth
in
idleness
that
what
he
had
gained
was
by
his
own
labour
and
i
must
be
indebted
for
my
living
to
the
same
source
these
hints
were
easily
understood
at
first
they
excited
indignation
and
grief
i
knew
the
source
whence
they
sprung
and
was
merely
able
to
suppress
the
utterance
of
my
feelings
in
her
presence
my
looks
however
were
abundantly
significant
and
my
company
became
hourly
more
insupportable
abstracted
from
these
considerations
my
father's
remonstrances
were
not
destitute
of
weight
he
gave
me
being
but
sustenance
ought
surely
to
be
my
own
gift
in
the
use
of
that
for
which
he
had
been
indebted
to
his
own
exertions
he
might
reasonably
consult
his
own
choice
he
assumed
no
control
over
me
he
merely
did
what
he
would
with
his
own
and
so
far
from
fettering
my
liberty
he
exhorted
me
to
use
it
for
my
own
benefit
and
to
make
provision
for
myself
i
now
reflected
that
there
were
other
manual
occupations
besides
that
of
the
plough
among
these
none
had
fewer
disadvantages
than
that
of
carpenter
or
cabinet-maker
i
had
no
knowledge
of
this
art
but
neither
custom
nor
law
nor
the
impenetrableness
of
the
mystery
required
me
to
serve
a
seven
years'
apprenticeship
to
it
a
master
in
this
trade
might
possibly
be
persuaded
to
take
me
under
his
tuition
two
or
three
years
would
suffice
to
give
me
the
requisite
skill
meanwhile
my
father
would
perhaps
consent
to
bear
the
cost
of
my
maintenance
nobody
could
live
upon
less
than
i
was
willing
to
do
i
mentioned
these
ideas
to
my
father
but
he
merely
commended
my
intentions
without
offering
to
assist
me
in
the
execution
of
them
he
had
full
employment
he
said
for
all
the
profits
of
his
ground
no
doubt
if
i
would
bind
myself
to
serve
four
or
five
years
my
master
would
be
at
the
expense
of
my
subsistence
be
that
as
it
would
i
must
look
for
nothing
from
him
i
had
shown
very
little
regard
for
his
happiness
i
had
refused
all
marks
of
respect
to
a
woman
who
was
entitled
to
it
from
her
relation
to
him
he
did
not
see
why
he
should
treat
as
a
son
one
who
refused
what
was
due
to
him
as
a
father
he
thought
it
right
that
i
should
henceforth
maintain
myself
he
did
not
want
my
services
on
the
farm
and
the
sooner
i
quitted
his
house
the
better
i
retired
from
this
conference
with
a
resolution
to
follow
the
advice
that
was
given
i
saw
that
henceforth
i
must
be
my
own
protector
and
wondered
at
the
folly
that
detained
me
so
long
under
his
roof
to
leave
it
was
now
become
indispensable
and
there
could
be
no
reason
for
delaying
my
departure
for
a
single
hour
i
determined
to
bend
my
course
to
the
city
the
scheme
foremost
in
my
mind
was
to
apprentice
myself
to
some
mechanical
trade
i
did
not
overlook
the
evils
of
constraint
and
the
dubiousness
as
to
the
character
of
the
master
i
should
choose
i
was
not
without
hopes
that
accident
would
suggest
a
different
expedient
and
enable
me
to
procure
an
immediate
subsistence
without
forfeiting
my
liberty
i
determined
to
commence
my
journey
the
next
morning
no
wonder
the
prospect
of
so
considerable
a
change
in
my
condition
should
deprive
me
of
sleep
i
spent
the
night
ruminating
on
the
future
and
in
painting
to
my
fancy
the
adventures
which
i
should
be
likely
to
meet
the
foresight
of
man
is
in
proportion
to
his
knowledge
no
wonder
that
in
my
state
of
profound
ignorance
not
the
faintest
preconception
should
be
formed
of
the
events
that
really
befell
me
my
temper
was
inquisitive
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
scene
to
which
i
was
going
from
which
my
curiosity
expected
to
derive
gratification
discords
and
evil
smells
unsavoury
food
unwholesome
labour
and
irksome
companions
were
in
my
opinion
the
unavoidable
attendants
of
a
city
my
best
clothes
were
of
the
homeliest
texture
and
shape
my
whole
stock
of
linen
consisted
of
three
check
shirts
part
of
my
winter
evenings'
employment
since
the
death
of
my
mother
consisted
in
knitting
my
own
stockings
of
these
i
had
three
pair
one
of
which
i
put
on
and
the
rest
i
formed
together
with
two
shirts
into
a
bundle
three
quarter-dollar
pieces
composed
my
whole
fortune
in
money
i
rose
at
the
dawn
and
without
asking
or
bestowing
a
blessing
sallied
forth
into
the
highroad
to
the
city
which
passed
near
the
house
i
left
nothing
behind
the
loss
of
which
i
regretted
i
had
purchased
most
of
my
own
books
with
the
product
of
my
own
separate
industry
and
their
number
being
of
course
small
i
had
by
incessant
application
gotten
the
whole
of
them
by
rote
they
had
ceased
therefore
to
be
of
any
further
use
i
left
them
without
reluctance
to
the
fate
for
which
i
knew
them
to
be
reserved
that
of
affording
food
and
habitation
to
mice
i
trod
this
unwonted
path
with
all
the
fearlessness
of
youth
in
spite
of
the
motives
to
despondency
and
apprehension
incident
to
my
state
my
heels
were
light
and
my
heart
joyous
now
said
i
i
am
mounted
into
man
i
must
build
a
name
and
a
fortune
for
myself
strange
if
this
intellect
and
these
hands
will
not
supply
me
with
an
honest
livelihood
i
will
try
the
city
in
the
first
place
but
if
that
should
fail
resources
are
still
left
to
me
i
will
resume
my
post
in
the
cornfield
and
threshing-floor
to
which
i
shall
always
have
access
and
where
i
shall
always
be
happy
i
had
proceeded
some
miles
on
my
journey
when
i
began
to
feel
the
inroads
of
hunger
i
might
have
stopped
at
any
farm-house
and
have
breakfasted
for
nothing
it
was
prudent
to
husband
with
the
utmost
care
my
slender
stock
but
i
felt
reluctance
to
beg
as
long
as
i
had
the
means
of
buying
and
i
imagined
that
coarse
bread
and
a
little
milk
would
cost
little
even
at
a
tavern
when
any
farmer
was
willing
to
bestow
them
for
nothing
my
resolution
was
further
influenced
by
the
appearance
of
a
signpost
what
excuse
could
i
make
for
begging
a
breakfast
with
an
inn
at
hand
and
silver
in
my
pocket
i
stopped
accordingly
and
breakfasted
the
landlord
was
remarkably
attentive
and
obliging
but
his
bread
was
stale
his
milk
sour
and
his
cheese
the
greenest
imaginable
i
disdained
to
animadvert
on
these
defects
naturally
supposing
that
his
house
could
furnish
no
better
having
finished
my
meal
i
put
without
speaking
one
of
my
pieces
into
his
hand
this
deportment
i
conceived
to
be
highly
becoming
and
to
indicate
a
liberal
and
manly
spirit
i
always
regarded
with
contempt
a
scrupulous
maker
of
bargains
he
received
the
money
with
a
complaisant
obeisance
right
said
he
just
the
money
sir
you
are
on
foot
sir
a
pleasant
way
of
travelling
sir
i
wish
you
a
good
day
sir
so
saying
he
walked
away
this
proceeding
was
wholly
unexpected
i
conceived
myself
entitled
to
at
least
three-fourths
of
it
in
change
the
first
impulse
was
to
call
him
back
and
contest
the
equity
of
his
demand
but
a
moment's
reflection
showed
me
the
absurdity
of
such
conduct
i
resumed
my
journey
with
spirits
somewhat
depressed
i
have
heard
of
voyagers
and
wanderers
in
deserts
who
were
willing
to
give
a
casket
of
gems
for
a
cup
of
cold
water
i
had
not
supposed
my
own
condition
to
be
in
any
respect
similar
yet
i
had
just
given
one-third
of
my
estate
for
a
breakfast
i
stopped
at
noon
at
another
inn
i
counted
on
purchasing
a
dinner
for
the
same
price
since
i
meant
to
content
myself
with
the
same
fare
a
large
company
was
just
sitting
down
to
a
smoking
banquet
the
landlord
invited
me
to
join
them
i
took
my
place
at
the
table
but
was
furnished
with
bread
and
milk
being
prepared
to
depart
i
took
him
aside
what
is
to
pay
said
i--did
you
drink
any
thing
sir--certainly
i
drank
the
milk
which
was
furnished--but
any
liquors
sir---no
he
deliberated
a
moment
and
then
assuming
an
air
of
disinterestedness
'tis
our
custom
to
charge
dinner
and
club
but
as
you
drank
nothing
we'll
let
the
club
go
a
mere
dinner
is
half
a
dollar
sir
he
had
no
leisure
to
attend
to
my
fluctuations
after
debating
with
myself
on
what
was
to
be
done
i
concluded
that
compliance
was
best
and
leaving
the
money
at
the
bar
resumed
my
way
i
had
not
performed
more
than
half
my
journey
yet
my
purse
was
entirely
exhausted
this
was
a
specimen
of
the
cost
incurred
by
living
at
an
inn
if
i
entered
the
city
a
tavern
must
at
least
for
some
time
be
my
abode
but
i
had
not
a
farthing
remaining
to
defray
my
charges
my
father
had
formerly
entertained
a
boarder
for
a
dollar
per
week
and
in
case
of
need
i
was
willing
to
subsist
upon
coarser
fare
and
lie
on
a
harder
bed
than
those
with
which
our
guest
had
been
supplied
these
facts
had
been
the
foundation
of
my
negligence
on
this
occasion
what
was
now
to
be
done
to
return
to
my
paternal
mansion
was
impossible
to
relinquish
my
design
of
entering
the
city
and
to
seek
a
temporary
asylum
if
not
permanent
employment
at
some
one
of
the
plantations
within
view
was
the
most
obvious
expedient
these
deliberations
did
not
slacken
my
pace
i
was
almost
unmindful
of
my
way
when
i
found
i
had
passed
schuylkill
at
the
upper
bridge
i
was
now
within
the
precincts
of
the
city
and
night
was
hastening
it
behooved
me
to
come
to
a
speedy
decision
suddenly
i
recollected
that
i
had
not
paid
the
customary
toll
at
the
bridge
neither
had
i
money
wherewith
to
pay
it
a
demand
of
payment
would
have
suddenly
arrested
my
progress
and
so
slight
an
incident
would
have
precluded
that
wonderful
destiny
to
which
i
was
reserved
the
obstacle
that
would
have
hindered
my
advance
now
prevented
my
return
scrupulous
honesty
did
not
require
me
to
turn
back
and
awaken
the
vigilance
of
the
toll-gatherer
i
had
nothing
to
pay
and
by
returning
i
should
only
double
my
debt
let
it
stand
said
i
where
it
does
all
that
honour
enjoins
is
to
pay
when
i
am
able
i
adhered
to
the
crossways
till
i
reached
market
street
night
had
fallen
and
a
triple
row
of
lamps
presented
a
spectacle
enchanting
and
new
my
personal
cares
were
for
a
time
lost
in
the
tumultuous
sensations
with
which
i
was
now
engrossed
i
had
never
visited
the
city
at
this
hour
when
my
last
visit
was
paid
i
was
a
mere
child
the
novelty
which
environed
every
object
was
therefore
nearly
absolute
i
proceeded
with
more
cautious
steps
but
was
still
absorbed
in
attention
to
passing
objects
i
reached
the
market-house
and
entering
it
indulged
myself
in
new
delight
and
new
wonder
i
need
not
remark
that
our
ideas
of
magnificence
and
splendour
are
merely
comparative
yet
you
may
be
prompted
to
smile
when
i
tell
you
that
in
walking
through
this
avenue
i
for
a
moment
conceived
myself
transported
to
the
hall
pendent
with
many
a
row
of
starry
lamps
and
blazing
crescents
fed
by
naphtha
and
asphaltos
that
this
transition
from
my
homely
and
quiet
retreat
had
been
effected
in
so
few
hours
wore
the
aspect
of
miracle
or
magic
i
proceeded
from
one
of
these
buildings
to
another
till
i
reached
their
termination
in
front
street
here
my
progress
was
checked
and
i
sought
repose
to
my
weary
limbs
by
seating
myself
on
a
stall
no
wonder
some
fatigue
was
felt
by
me
accustomed
as
i
was
to
strenuous
exertions
since
exclusive
of
the
minutes
spent
at
breakfast
and
dinner
i
had
travelled
fifteen
hours
and
forty-five
miles
i
began
now
to
reflect
with
some
earnestness
on
my
condition
i
was
a
stranger
friendless
and
moneyless
i
was
unable
to
purchase
food
and
shelter
and
was
wholly
unused
to
the
business
of
begging
hunger
was
the
only
serious
inconvenience
to
which
i
was
immediately
exposed
i
had
no
objection
to
spend
the
night
in
the
spot
where
i
then
sat
i
had
no
fear
that
my
visions
would
be
troubled
by
the
officers
of
police
it
was
no
crime
to
be
without
a
home
but
how
should
i
supply
my
present
cravings
and
the
cravings
of
to-morrow
at
length
it
occurred
to
me
that
one
of
our
country
neighbours
was
probably
at
this
time
in
the
city
he
kept
a
store
as
well
as
cultivated
a
farm
he
was
a
plain
and
well-meaning
man
and
should
i
be
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
him
his
superior
knowledge
of
the
city
might
be
of
essential
benefit
to
me
in
my
present
forlorn
circumstances
his
generosity
might
likewise
induce
him
to
lend
me
so
much
as
would
purchase
one
meal
i
had
formed
the
resolution
to
leave
the
city
next
day
and
was
astonished
at
the
folly
that
had
led
me
into
it
but
meanwhile
my
physical
wants
must
be
supplied
where
should
i
look
for
this
man
in
the
course
of
conversation
i
recollected
him
to
have
referred
to
the
place
of
his
temporary
abode
it
was
an
inn
but
the
sign
or
the
name
of
the
keeper
for
some
time
withstood
all
my
efforts
to
recall
them
at
length
i
lighted
on
the
last
it
was
lesher's
tavern
i
immediately
set
out
in
search
of
it
after
many
inquiries
i
at
last
arrived
at
the
door
i
was
preparing
to
enter
the
house
when
i
perceived
that
my
bundle
was
gone
i
had
left
it
on
the
stall
where
i
had
been
sitting
people
were
perpetually
passing
to
and
fro
it
was
scarcely
possible
not
to
have
been
noticed
no
one
that
observed
it
would
fail
to
make
it
his
prey
yet
it
was
of
too
much
value
to
me
to
allow
me
to
be
governed
by
a
bare
probability
i
resolved
to
lose
not
a
moment
in
returning
with
some
difficulty
i
retraced
my
steps
but
the
bundle
had
disappeared
the
clothes
were
in
themselves
of
small
value
but
they
constituted
the
whole
of
my
wardrobe
and
i
now
reflected
that
they
were
capable
of
being
transmuted
by
the
pawn
or
sale
of
them
into
food
there
were
other
wretches
as
indigent
as
i
was
and
i
consoled
myself
by
thinking
that
my
shirts
and
stockings
might
furnish
a
seasonable
covering
to
their
nakedness
but
there
was
a
relic
concealed
within
this
bundle
the
loss
of
which
could
scarcely
be
endured
by
me
it
was
the
portrait
of
a
young
man
who
died
three
years
ago
at
my
father's
house
drawn
by
his
own
hand
he
was
discovered
one
morning
in
the
orchard
with
many
marks
of
insanity
upon
him
his
air
and
dress
bespoke
some
elevation
of
rank
and
fortune
my
mother's
compassion
was
excited
and
as
his
singularities
were
harmless
an
asylum
was
afforded
him
though
he
was
unable
to
pay
for
it
he
was
constantly
declaiming
in
an
incoherent
manner
about
some
mistress
who
had
proved
faithless
his
speeches
seemed
however
like
the
rantings
of
an
actor
to
be
rehearsed
by
rote
or
for
the
sake
of
exercise
he
was
totally
careless
of
his
person
and
health
and
by
repeated
negligences
of
this
kind
at
last
contracted
a
fever
of
which
he
speedily
died
the
name
which
he
assumed
was
clavering
he
gave
no
distinct
account
of
his
family
but
stated
in
loose
terms
that
they
were
residents
in
england
high-born
and
wealthy
that
they
had
denied
him
the
woman
whom
he
loved
and
banished
him
to
america
under
penalty
of
death
if
he
should
dare
to
return
and
that
they
had
refused
him
all
means
of
subsistence
in
a
foreign
land
he
predicted
in
his
wild
and
declamatory
way
his
own
death
he
was
very
skilful
at
the
pencil
and
drew
this
portrait
a
short
time
before
his
dissolution
presented
it
to
me
and
charged
me
to
preserve
it
in
remembrance
of
him
my
mother
loved
the
youth
because
he
was
amiable
and
unfortunate
and
chiefly
because
she
fancied
a
very
powerful
resemblance
between
his
countenance
and
mine
i
was
too
young
to
build
affection
on
any
rational
foundation
i
loved
him
for
whatever
reason
with
an
ardour
unusual
at
my
age
and
which
this
portrait
had
contributed
to
prolong
and
to
cherish
in
thus
finally
leaving
my
home
i
was
careful
not
to
leave
this
picture
behind
i
wrapped
it
in
paper
in
which
a
few
elegiac
stanzas
were
inscribed
in
my
own
hand
and
with
my
utmost
elegance
of
penmanship
i
then
placed
it
in
a
leathern
case
which
for
greater
security
was
deposited
in
the
centre
of
my
bundle
it
will
occur
to
you
perhaps
that
it
would
be
safer
in
some
fold
or
pocket
of
the
clothes
which
i
wore
i
was
of
a
different
opinion
and
was
now
to
endure
the
penalty
of
my
error
it
was
in
vain
to
heap
execrations
on
my
negligence
or
to
consume
the
little
strength
left
to
me
in
regrets
i
returned
once
more
to
the
tavern
and
made
inquiries
for
mr
capper
the
person
whom
i
have
just
mentioned
as
my
father's
neighbour
i
was
informed
that
capper
was
now
in
town
that
he
had
lodged
on
the
last
night
at
this
house
that
he
had
expected
to
do
the
same
to-night
but
a
gentleman
had
called
ten
minutes
ago
whose
invitation
to
lodge
with
him
to-night
had
been
accepted
they
had
just
gone
out
together
who
i
asked
was
the
gentleman
the
landlord
had
no
knowledge
of
him
he
knew
neither
his
place
of
abode
nor
his
name
was
mr
capper
expected
to
return
hither
in
the
morning
no
he
had
heard
the
stranger
propose
to
mr
capper
to
go
with
him
into
the
country
to-morrow
and
mr
capper
he
believed
had
assented
this
disappointment
was
peculiarly
severe
i
had
lost
by
my
own
negligence
the
only
opportunity
that
would
offer
of
meeting
my
friend
had
even
the
recollection
of
my
loss
been
postponed
for
three
minutes
i
should
have
entered
the
house
and
a
meeting
would
have
been
secured
i
could
discover
no
other
expedient
to
obviate
the
present
evil
my
heart
began
now
for
the
first
time
to
droop
i
looked
back
with
nameless
emotions
on
the
days
of
my
infancy
i
called
up
the
image
of
my
mother
i
reflected
on
the
infatuation
of
my
surviving
parent
and
the
usurpation
of
the
detestable
betty
with
horror
i
viewed
myself
as
the
most
calamitous
and
desolate
of
human
beings
at
this
time
i
was
sitting
in
the
common
room
there
were
others
in
the
same
apartment
lounging
or
whistling
or
singing
i
noticed
them
not
but
leaning
my
head
upon
my
hand
i
delivered
myself
up
to
painful
and
intense
meditation
from
this
i
was
roused
by
some
one
placing
himself
on
the
bench
near
me
and
addressing
me
thus--pray
sir
if
you
will
excuse
me
who
was
the
person
whom
you
were
looking
for
just
now
perhaps
i
can
give
you
the
information
you
want
if
i
can
you
will
be
very
welcome
to
it
i
fixed
my
eyes
with
some
eagerness
on
the
person
that
spoke
he
was
a
young
man
expensively
and
fashionably
dressed
whose
mien
was
considerably
prepossessing
and
whose
countenance
bespoke
some
portion
of
discernment
i
described
to
him
the
man
whom
i
sought
i
am
in
search
of
the
same
man
myself
said
he
but
i
expect
to
meet
him
here
he
may
lodge
elsewhere
but
he
promised
to
meet
me
here
at
half
after
nine
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
fulfil
his
promise
so
that
you
will
meet
the
gentleman
i
was
highly
gratified
by
this
information
and
thanked
my
informant
with
some
degree
of
warmth
my
gratitude
he
did
not
notice
but
continued
in
order
to
beguile
expectation
i
have
ordered
supper
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
partake
with
me
unless
indeed
you
have
supped
already
i
was
obliged
somewhat
awkwardly
to
decline
his
invitation
conscious
as
i
was
that
the
means
of
payment
were
not
in
my
power
he
continued
however
to
urge
my
compliance
till
at
length
it
was
though
reluctantly
yielded
my
chief
motive
was
the
certainty
of
seeing
capper
my
new
acquaintance
was
exceedingly
conversible
but
his
conversation
was
chiefly
characterized
by
frankness
and
good-humour
my
reserve
gradually
diminished
and
i
ventured
to
inform
him
in
general
terms
of
my
former
condition
and
present
views
he
listened
to
my
details
with
seeming
attention
and
commented
on
them
with
some
judiciousness
his
statements
however
tended
to
discourage
me
from
remaining
in
the
city
meanwhile
the
hour
passed
and
capper
did
not
appear
i
noticed
this
circumstance
to
him
with
no
little
solicitude
he
said
that
possibly
he
might
have
forgotten
or
neglected
his
engagement
his
affair
was
not
of
the
highest
importance
and
might
be
readily
postponed
to
a
future
opportunity
he
perceived
that
my
vivacity
was
greatly
damped
by
this
intelligence
he
importuned
me
to
disclose
the
cause
he
made
himself
very
merry
with
my
distress
when
it
was
at
length
discovered
as
to
the
expense
of
supper
i
had
partaken
of
it
at
his
invitation
he
therefore
should
of
course
be
charged
with
it
as
to
lodging
he
had
a
chamber
and
a
bed
which
he
would
insist
upon
my
sharing
with
him
my
faculties
were
thus
kept
upon
the
stretch
of
wonder
every
new
act
of
kindness
in
this
man
surpassed
the
fondest
expectation
that
i
had
formed
i
saw
no
reason
why
i
should
be
treated
with
benevolence
i
should
have
acted
in
the
same
manner
if
placed
in
the
same
circumstances
yet
it
appeared
incongruous
and
inexplicable
i
know
whence
my
ideas
of
human
nature
were
derived
they
certainly
were
not
the
offspring
of
my
own
feelings
these
would
have
taught
me
that
interest
and
duty
were
blended
in
every
act
of
generosity
i
did
not
come
into
the
world
without
my
scruples
and
suspicions
i
was
more
apt
to
impute
kindnesses
to
sinister
and
hidden
than
to
obvious
and
laudable
motives
i
paused
to
reflect
upon
the
possible
designs
of
this
person
what
end
could
be
served
by
this
behaviour
i
was
no
subject
of
violence
or
fraud
i
had
neither
trinket
nor
coin
to
stimulate
the
treachery
of
others
what
was
offered
was
merely
lodging
for
the
night
was
this
an
act
of
such
transcendent
disinterestedness
as
to
be
incredible
my
garb
was
meaner
than
that
of
my
companion
but
my
intellectual
accomplishments
were
at
least
upon
a
level
with
his
why
should
he
be
supposed
to
be
insensible
to
my
claims
upon
his
kindness
i
was
a
youth
destitute
of
experience
money
and
friends
but
i
was
not
devoid
of
all
mental
and
personal
endowments
that
my
merit
should
be
discovered
even
on
such
slender
intercourse
had
surely
nothing
in
it
that
shocked
belief
while
i
was
thus
deliberating
my
new
friend
was
earnest
in
his
solicitations
for
my
company
he
remarked
my
hesitation
but
ascribed
it
to
a
wrong
cause
come
said
he
i
can
guess
your
objections
and
can
obviate
them
you
are
afraid
of
being
ushered
into
company
and
people
who
have
passed
their
lives
like
you
have
a
wonderful
antipathy
to
strange
faces
but
this
is
bedtime
with
our
family
so
that
we
can
defer
your
introduction
to
them
till
to-morrow
we
may
go
to
our
chamber
without
being
seen
by
any
but
servants
i
had
not
been
aware
of
this
circumstance
my
reluctance
flowed
from
a
different
cause
but
now
that
the
inconveniences
of
ceremony
were
mentioned
they
appeared
to
me
of
considerable
weight
i
was
well
pleased
that
they
should
thus
be
avoided
and
consented
to
go
along
with
him
we
passed
several
streets
and
turned
several
corners
at
last
we
turned
into
a
kind
of
court
which
seemed
to
be
chiefly
occupied
by
stables
we
will
go
said
he
by
the
back
way
into
the
house
we
shall
thus
save
ourselves
the
necessity
of
entering
the
parlour
where
some
of
the
family
may
still
be
my
companion
was
as
talkative
as
ever
but
said
nothing
from
which
i
could
gather
any
knowledge
of
the
number
character
and
condition
of
his
family
we
arrived
at
a
brick
wall
through
which
we
passed
by
a
gate
into
an
extensive
court
or
yard
the
darkness
would
allow
me
to
see
nothing
but
outlines
compared
with
the
pigmy
dimensions
of
my
father's
wooden
hovel
the
buildings
before
me
were
of
gigantic
loftiness
the
horses
were
here
far
more
magnificently
accommodated
than
i
had
been
by
a
large
door
we
entered
an
elevated
hall
stay
here
said
he
just
while
i
fetch
a
light
he
returned
bearing
a
candle
before
i
had
time
to
ponder
on
my
present
situation
we
now
ascended
a
staircase
covered
with
painted
canvas
no
one
whose
inexperience
is
less
than
mine
can
imagine
to
himself
the
impressions
made
upon
me
by
surrounding
objects
the
height
to
which
this
stair
ascended
its
dimensions
and
its
ornaments
appeared
to
me
a
combination
of
all
that
was
pompous
and
superb
we
stopped
not
till
we
had
reached
the
third
story
here
my
companion
unlocked
and
led
the
way
into
a
chamber
this
said
he
is
my
room
permit
me
to
welcome
you
into
it
i
had
no
time
to
examine
this
room
before
by
some
accident
the
candle
was
extinguished
curse
upon
my
carelessness
said
he
i
must
go
down
again
and
light
the
candle
i
will
return
in
a
twinkling
meanwhile
you
may
undress
yourself
and
go
to
bed
he
went
out
and
as
i
afterwards
recollected
locked
the
door
behind
him
i
was
not
indisposed
to
follow
his
advice
but
my
curiosity
would
first
be
gratified
by
a
survey
of
the
room
its
height
and
spaciousness
were
imperfectly
discernible
by
starlight
and
by
gleams
from
a
street-lamp
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
carpet
the
walls
with
brilliant
hangings
the
bed
and
windows
were
shrouded
by
curtains
of
a
rich
texture
and
glossy
hues
hitherto
i
had
merely
read
of
these
things
i
knew
them
to
be
the
decorations
of
opulence
and
yet
as
i
viewed
them
and
remembered
where
and
what
i
was
on
the
same
hour
the
preceding
day
i
could
scarcely
believe
myself
awake
or
that
my
senses
were
not
beguiled
by
some
spell
where
said
i
will
this
adventure
terminate
i
rise
on
the
morrow
with
the
dawn
and
speed
into
the
country
when
this
night
is
remembered
how
like
a
vision
will
it
appear
if
i
tell
the
tale
by
a
kitchen-fire
my
veracity
will
be
disputed
i
shall
be
ranked
with
the
story-tellers
of
shiraz
and
bagdad
though
busied
in
these
reflections
i
was
not
inattentive
to
the
progress
of
time
methought
my
companion
was
remarkably
dilatory
he
went
merely
to
relight
his
candle
but
certainly
he
might
during
this
time
have
performed
the
operation
ten
times
over
some
unforeseen
accident
might
occasion
his
delay
another
interval
passed
and
no
tokens
of
his
coming
i
began
now
to
grow
uneasy
i
was
unable
to
account
for
his
detention
was
not
some
treachery
designed
i
went
to
the
door
and
found
that
it
was
locked
this
heightened
my
suspicions
i
was
alone
a
stranger
in
an
upper
room
of
the
house
should
my
conductor
have
disappeared
by
design
or
by
accident
and
some
one
of
the
family
should
find
me
here
what
would
be
the
consequence
should
i
not
be
arrested
as
a
thief
and
conveyed
to
prison
my
transition
from
the
street
to
this
chamber
would
not
be
more
rapid
than
my
passage
hence
to
a
jail
these
ideas
struck
me
with
panic
i
revolved
them
anew
but
they
only
acquired
greater
plausibility
no
doubt
i
had
been
the
victim
of
malicious
artifice
inclination
however
conjured
up
opposite
sentiments
and
my
fears
began
to
subside
what
motive
i
asked
could
induce
a
human
being
to
inflict
wanton
injury
i
could
not
account
for
his
delay
but
how
numberless
were
the
contingencies
that
might
occasion
it
i
was
somewhat
comforted
by
these
reflections
but
the
consolation
they
afforded
was
short-lived
i
was
listening
with
the
utmost
eagerness
to
catch
the
sound
of
a
foot
when
a
noise
was
indeed
heard
but
totally
unlike
a
step
it
was
human
breath
struggling
as
it
were
for
passage
on
the
first
effort
of
attention
it
appeared
like
a
groan
whence
it
arose
i
could
not
tell
he
that
uttered
it
was
near
perhaps
in
the
room
presently
the
same
noise
was
again
heard
and
now
i
perceived
that
it
came
from
the
bed
it
was
accompanied
with
a
motion
like
some
one
changing
his
posture
what
i
at
first
conceived
to
be
a
groan
appeared
now
to
be
nothing
more
than
the
expiration
of
a
sleeping
man
what
should
i
infer
from
this
incident
my
companion
did
not
apprize
me
that
the
apartment
was
inhabited
was
his
imposture
a
jestful
or
a
wicked
one
there
was
no
need
to
deliberate
there
were
no
means
of
concealment
or
escape
the
person
would
some
time
awaken
and
detect
me
the
interval
would
only
be
fraught
with
agony
and
it
was
wise
to
shorten
it
should
i
not
withdraw
the
curtain
awake
the
person
and
encounter
at
once
all
the
consequences
of
my
situation
i
glided
softly
to
the
bed
when
the
thought
occurred
may
not
the
sleeper
be
a
female
i
cannot
describe
the
mixture
of
dread
and
of
shame
which
glowed
in
my
veins
the
light
in
which
such
a
visitant
would
be
probably
regarded
by
a
woman's
fears
the
precipitate
alarms
that
might
be
given
the
injury
which
i
might
unknowingly
inflict
or
undeservedly
suffer
threw
my
thoughts
into
painful
confusion
my
presence
might
pollute
a
spotless
reputation
or
furnish
fuel
to
jealousy
still
though
it
were
a
female
would
not
less
injury
be
done
by
gently
interrupting
her
slumber
but
the
question
of
sex
still
remained
to
be
decided
for
this
end
i
once
more
approached
the
bed
and
drew
aside
the
silk
the
sleeper
was
a
babe
this
i
discovered
by
the
glimmer
of
a
street-lamp
part
of
my
solicitudes
were
now
removed
it
was
plain
that
this
chamber
belonged
to
a
nurse
or
a
mother
she
had
not
yet
come
to
bed
perhaps
it
was
a
married
pair
and
their
approach
might
be
momently
expected
i
pictured
to
myself
their
entrance
and
my
own
detection
i
could
imagine
no
consequence
that
was
not
disastrous
and
horrible
and
from
which
i
would
not
at
any
price
escape
i
again
examined
the
door
and
found
that
exit
by
this
avenue
was
impossible
there
were
other
doors
in
this
room
any
practicable
expedient
in
this
extremity
was
to
be
pursued
one
of
these
was
bolted
i
unfastened
it
and
found
a
considerable
space
within
should
i
immure
myself
in
this
closet
i
saw
no
benefit
that
would
finally
result
from
it
i
discovered
that
there
was
a
bolt
on
the
inside
which
would
somewhat
contribute
to
security
this
being
drawn
no
one
could
enter
without
breaking
the
door
i
had
scarcely
paused
when
the
long-expected
sound
of
footsteps
was
heard
in
the
entry
was
it
my
companion
or
a
stranger
if
it
were
the
latter
i
had
not
yet
mustered
courage
sufficient
to
meet
him
i
cannot
applaud
the
magnanimity
of
my
proceeding
but
no
one
can
expect
intrepid
or
judicious
measures
from
one
in
my
circumstances
i
stepped
into
the
closet
and
closed
the
door
some
one
immediately
after
unlocked
the
chamber
door
he
was
unattended
with
a
light
the
footsteps
as
they
moved
along
the
carpet
could
scarcely
be
heard
i
waited
impatiently
for
some
token
by
which
i
might
be
governed
i
put
my
ear
to
the
keyhole
and
at
length
heard
a
voice
but
not
that
of
my
companion
exclaim
somewhat
above
a
whisper
smiling
cherub
safe
and
sound
i
see
would
to
god
my
experiment
may
succeed
and
that
thou
mayest
find
a
mother
where
i
have
found
a
wife
there
he
stopped
he
appeared
to
kiss
the
babe
and
presently
retiring
locked
the
door
after
him
these
words
were
capable
of
no
consistent
meaning
they
served
at
least
to
assure
me
that
i
had
been
treacherously
dealt
with
this
chamber
it
was
manifest
did
not
belong
to
my
companion
i
put
up
prayers
to
my
deity
that
he
would
deliver
me
from
these
toils
what
a
condition
was
mine
immersed
in
palpable
darkness
shut
up
in
this
unknown
recess
lurking
like
a
robber
my
meditations
were
disturbed
by
new
sounds
the
door
was
unlocked
more
than
one
person
entered
the
apartment
and
light
streamed
through
the
keyhole
i
looked
but
the
aperture
was
too
small
and
the
figures
passed
too
quickly
to
permit
me
the
sight
of
them
i
bent
my
ear
and
this
imparted
some
more
authentic
information
the
man
as
i
judged
by
the
voice
was
the
same
who
had
just
departed
rustling
of
silk
denoted
his
companion
to
be
female
some
words
being
uttered
by
the
man
in
too
low
a
key
to
be
overheard
the
lady
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
he
strove
to
comfort
her
by
soothing
tones
and
tender
appellations
how
can
it
be
helped
said
he
it
is
time
to
resume
your
courage
your
duty
to
yourself
and
to
me
requires
you
to
subdue
this
unreasonable
grief
he
spoke
frequently
in
this
strain
but
all
he
said
seemed
to
have
little
influence
in
pacifying
the
lady
at
length
however
her
sobs
began
to
lessen
in
vehemence
and
frequency
he
exhorted
her
to
seek
for
some
repose
apparently
she
prepared
to
comply
and
conversation
was
for
a
few
minutes
intermitted
i
could
not
but
advert
to
the
possibility
that
some
occasion
to
examine
the
closet
in
which
i
was
immured
might
occur
i
knew
not
in
what
manner
to
demean
myself
if
this
should
take
place
i
had
no
option
at
present
by
withdrawing
myself
from
view
i
had
lost
the
privilege
of
an
upright
deportment
yet
the
thought
of
spending
the
night
in
this
spot
was
not
to
be
endured
gradually
i
began
to
view
the
project
of
bursting
from
the
closet
and
trusting
to
the
energy
of
truth
and
of
an
artless
tale
with
more
complacency
more
than
once
my
hand
was
placed
upon
the
bolt
but
withdrawn
by
a
sudden
faltering
of
resolution
when
one
attempt
failed
i
recurred
once
more
to
such
reflections
as
were
adapted
to
renew
my
purpose
i
preconcerted
the
address
which
i
should
use
i
resolved
to
be
perfectly
explicit
to
withhold
no
particular
of
my
adventures
from
the
moment
of
my
arrival
my
description
must
necessarily
suit
some
person
within
their
knowledge
all
i
should
want
was
liberty
to
depart
but
if
this
were
not
allowed
i
might
at
least
hope
to
escape
any
ill
treatment
and
to
be
confronted
with
my
betrayer
in
that
case
i
did
not
fear
to
make
him
the
attester
of
my
innocence
influenced
by
these
considerations
i
once
more
touched
the
lock
at
that
moment
the
lady
shrieked
and
exclaimed
good
god
what
is
here
an
interesting
conversation
ensued
the
object
that
excited
her
astonishment
was
the
child
i
collected
from
what
passed
that
the
discovery
was
wholly
unexpected
by
her
her
husband
acted
as
if
equally
unaware
of
this
event
he
joined
in
all
her
exclamations
of
wonder
and
all
her
wild
conjectures
when
these
were
somewhat
exhausted
he
artfully
insinuated
the
propriety
of
bestowing
care
upon
the
little
foundling
i
now
found
that
her
grief
had
been
occasioned
by
the
recent
loss
of
her
own
offspring
she
was
for
some
time
averse
to
her
husband's
proposal
but
at
length
was
persuaded
to
take
the
babe
to
her
bosom
and
give
it
nourishment
this
incident
had
diverted
my
mind
from
its
favourite
project
and
filled
me
with
speculations
on
the
nature
of
the
scene
one
explication
was
obvious
that
the
husband
was
the
parent
of
this
child
and
had
used
this
singular
expedient
to
procure
for
it
the
maternal
protection
of
his
wife
it
would
soon
claim
from
her
all
the
fondness
which
she
entertained
for
her
own
progeny
no
suspicion
probably
had
yet
or
would
hereafter
occur
with
regard
to
its
true
parent
if
her
character
be
distinguished
by
the
usual
attributes
of
women
the
knowledge
of
this
truth
may
convert
her
love
into
hatred
i
reflected
with
amazement
on
the
slightness
of
that
thread
by
which
human
passions
are
led
from
their
true
direction
with
no
less
amazement
did
i
remark
the
complexity
of
incidents
by
which
i
had
been
empowered
to
communicate
to
her
this
truth
how
baseless
are
the
structures
of
falsehood
which
we
build
in
opposition
to
the
system
of
eternal
nature
if
i
should
escape
undetected
from
this
recess
it
will
be
true
that
i
never
saw
the
face
of
either
of
these
persons
and
yet
i
am
acquainted
with
the
most
secret
transaction
of
their
lives
my
own
situation
was
now
more
critical
than
before
the
lights
were
extinguished
and
the
parties
had
sought
repose
to
issue
from
the
closet
now
would
be
imminently
dangerous
my
councils
were
again
at
a
stand
and
my
designs
frustrated
meanwhile
the
persons
did
not
drop
their
discourse
and
i
thought
myself
justified
in
listening
many
facts
of
the
most
secret
and
momentous
nature
were
alluded
to
some
allusions
were
unintelligible
to
others
i
was
able
to
affix
a
plausible
meaning
and
some
were
palpable
enough
every
word
that
was
uttered
on
that
occasion
is
indelibly
imprinted
on
my
memory
perhaps
the
singularity
of
my
circumstances
and
my
previous
ignorance
of
what
was
passing
in
the
world
contributed
to
render
me
a
greedy
listener
most
that
was
said
i
shall
overlook
but
one
part
of
the
conversation
it
will
be
necessary
to
repeat
a
large
company
had
assembled
that
evening
at
their
house
they
criticized
the
character
and
manners
of
several
at
last
the
husband
said
what
think
you
of
the
nabob
especially
when
he
talked
about
riches
how
artfully
he
encourages
the
notion
of
his
poverty
yet
not
a
soul
believes
him
i
cannot
for
my
part
account
for
that
scheme
of
his
i
half
suspect
that
his
wealth
flows
from
a
bad
source
since
he
is
so
studious
of
concealing
it
perhaps
after
all
said
the
lady
you
are
mistaken
as
to
his
wealth
impossible
exclaimed
the
other
mark
how
he
lives
have
i
not
seen
his
bank-account
his
deposits
since
he
has
been
here
amount
to
no
less
than
half
a
million
heaven
grant
that
it
be
so
said
the
lady
with
a
sigh
i
shall
think
with
less
aversion
of
your
scheme
if
poor
tom's
fortune
be
made
and
he
not
the
worse
or
but
little
the
worse
on
that
account
i
shall
think
it
on
the
whole
best
that
replied
he
is
what
reconciles
me
to
the
scheme
to
him
thirty
thousand
are
nothing
but
will
he
not
suspect
you
of
some
hand
in
it
how
can
he
will
i
not
appear
to
lose
as
well
as
himself
tom
is
my
brother
but
who
can
be
supposed
to
answer
for
a
brother's
integrity
but
he
cannot
suspect
either
of
us
nothing
less
than
a
miracle
can
bring
our
plot
to
light
besides
this
man
is
not
what
he
ought
to
be
he
will
some
time
or
other
come
out
to
be
a
grand
impostor
he
makes
money
by
other
arts
than
bargain
and
sale
he
has
found
his
way
by
some
means
to
the
portuguese
treasury
here
the
conversation
took
a
new
direction
and
after
some
time
the
silence
of
sleep
ensued
who
thought
i
is
this
nabob
who
counts
his
dollars
by
half-millions
and
on
whom
it
seems
as
if
some
fraud
was
intended
to
be
practised
amidst
their
wariness
and
subtlety
how
little
are
they
aware
that
their
conversation
has
been
overheard
by
means
as
inscrutable
as
those
which
conducted
me
hither
i
may
hereafter
be
enabled
to
profit
by
this
detection
of
a
plot
but
meanwhile
what
was
i
to
do
how
was
i
to
effect
my
escape
from
this
perilous
asylum
after
much
reflection
it
occurred
to
me
that
to
gain
the
street
without
exciting
their
notice
was
not
utterly
impossible
sleep
does
not
commonly
end
of
itself
unless
at
a
certain
period
what
impediments
were
there
between
me
and
liberty
which
i
could
not
remove
and
remove
with
so
much
caution
as
to
escape
notice
motion
and
sound
inevitably
go
together
but
every
sound
is
not
attended
to
the
doors
of
the
closet
and
the
chamber
did
not
creak
upon
their
hinges
the
latter
might
be
locked
this
i
was
able
to
ascertain
only
by
experiment
if
it
were
so
yet
the
key
was
probably
in
the
lock
and
might
be
used
without
much
noise
i
waited
till
their
slow
and
hoarser
inspirations
showed
them
to
be
both
asleep
just
then
on
changing
my
position
my
head
struck
against
some
things
which
depended
from
the
ceiling
of
the
closet
they
were
implements
of
some
kind
which
rattled
against
each
other
in
consequence
of
this
unlucky
blow
i
was
fearful
lest
this
noise
should
alarm
as
the
closet
was
little
distant
from
the
bed
the
breathing
of
one
instantly
ceased
and
a
motion
was
made
as
if
the
head
were
lifted
from
the
pillow
this
motion
which
was
made
by
the
husband
awaked
his
companion
who
exclaimed
what
is
the
matter
something
i
believe
replied
he
in
the
closet
if
i
was
not
dreaming
i
heard
the
pistols
strike
against
each
other
as
if
some
one
was
taking
them
down
this
intimation
was
well
suited
to
alarm
the
lady
she
besought
him
to
ascertain
the
matter
this
to
my
utter
dismay
he
at
first
consented
to
do
but
presently
observed
that
probably
his
ears
had
misinformed
him
it
was
hardly
possible
that
the
sound
proceeded
from
them
it
might
be
a
rat
or
his
own
fancy
might
have
fashioned
it
it
is
not
easy
to
describe
my
trepidations
while
this
conference
was
holding
i
saw
how
easily
their
slumber
was
disturbed
the
obstacles
to
my
escape
were
less
surmountable
than
i
had
imagined
in
a
little
time
all
was
again
still
i
waited
till
the
usual
tokens
of
sleep
were
distinguishable
i
once
more
resumed
my
attempt
the
bolt
was
withdrawn
with
all
possible
slowness
but
i
could
by
no
means
prevent
all
sound
my
state
was
full
of
inquietude
and
suspense
my
attention
being
painfully
divided
between
the
bolt
and
the
condition
of
the
sleepers
the
difficulty
lay
in
giving
that
degree
of
force
which
was
barely
sufficient
perhaps
not
less
than
fifteen
minutes
were
consumed
in
this
operation
at
last
it
was
happily
effected
and
the
door
was
cautiously
opened
emerging
as
i
did
from
utter
darkness
the
light
admitted
into
three
windows
produced
to
my
eyes
a
considerable
illumination
objects
which
on
my
first
entrance
into
this
apartment
were
invisible
were
now
clearly
discerned
the
bed
was
shrouded
by
curtains
yet
i
shrunk
back
into
my
covert
fearful
of
being
seen
to
facilitate
my
escape
i
put
off
my
shoes
my
mind
was
so
full
of
objects
of
more
urgent
moment
that
the
propriety
of
taking
them
along
with
me
never
occurred
i
left
them
in
the
closet
i
now
glided
across
the
apartment
to
the
door
i
was
not
a
little
discouraged
by
observing
that
the
key
was
wanting
my
whole
hope
depended
on
the
omission
to
lock
it
in
my
haste
to
ascertain
this
point
i
made
some
noise
which
again
roused
one
of
the
sleepers
he
started
and
cried
who
is
there
i
now
regarded
my
case
as
desperate
and
detection
as
inevitable
my
apprehensions
rather
than
my
caution
kept
me
mute
i
shrunk
to
the
wall
and
waited
in
a
kind
of
agony
for
the
moment
that
should
decide
my
fate
the
lady
was
again
roused
in
answer
to
her
inquiries
her
husband
said
that
some
one
he
believed
was
at
the
door
but
there
was
no
danger
of
their
entering
for
he
had
locked
it
and
the
key
was
in
his
pocket
my
courage
was
completely
annihilated
by
this
piece
of
intelligence
my
resources
were
now
at
an
end
i
could
only
remain
in
this
spot
till
the
morning
light
which
could
be
at
no
great
distance
should
discover
me
my
inexperience
disabled
me
from
estimating
all
the
perils
of
my
situation
perhaps
i
had
no
more
than
temporary
inconveniences
to
dread
my
intention
was
innocent
and
i
had
been
betrayed
into
my
present
situation
not
by
my
own
wickedness
but
the
wickedness
of
others
i
was
deeply
impressed
with
the
ambiguousness
which
would
necessarily
rest
upon
my
motives
and
the
scrutiny
to
which
they
would
be
subjected
i
shuddered
at
the
bare
possibility
of
being
ranked
with
thieves
these
reflections
again
gave
edge
to
my
ingenuity
in
search
of
the
means
of
escape
i
had
carefully
attended
to
the
circumstances
of
their
entrance
possibly
the
act
of
locking
had
been
unnoticed
but
was
it
not
likewise
possible
that
this
person
had
been
mistaken
the
key
was
gone
would
this
have
been
the
case
if
the
door
were
unlocked
my
fears
rather
than
my
hopes
impelled
me
to
make
the
experiment
i
drew
back
the
latch
and
to
my
unspeakable
joy
the
door
opened
i
passed
through
and
explored
my
way
to
the
staircase
i
descended
till
i
reached
the
bottom
i
could
not
recollect
with
accuracy
the
position
of
the
door
leading
into
the
court
but
by
carefully
feeling
along
the
wall
with
my
hands
i
at
length
discovered
it
it
was
fastened
by
several
bolts
and
a
lock
the
bolts
were
easily
withdrawn
but
the
key
was
removed
i
knew
not
where
it
was
deposited
i
thought
i
had
reached
the
threshold
of
liberty
but
here
was
an
impediment
that
threatened
to
be
insurmountable
but
if
doors
could
not
be
passed
windows
might
be
unbarred
i
remembered
that
my
companion
had
gone
into
a
door
on
the
left
hand
in
search
of
a
light
i
searched
for
this
door
fortunately
it
was
fastened
only
by
a
bolt
it
admitted
me
into
a
room
which
i
carefully
explored
till
i
reached
a
window
i
will
not
dwell
on
my
efforts
to
unbar
this
entrance
suffice
it
to
say
that
after
much
exertion
and
frequent
mistakes
i
at
length
found
my
way
into
the
yard
and
thence
passed
into
the
court
now
i
was
once
more
on
public
ground
by
so
many
anxious
efforts
had
i
disengaged
myself
from
the
perilous
precincts
of
private
property
as
many
stratagems
as
are
usually
made
to
enter
a
house
had
been
employed
by
me
to
get
out
of
it
i
was
urged
to
the
use
of
them
by
my
fears
yet
so
far
from
carrying
off
spoil
i
had
escaped
with
the
loss
of
an
essential
part
of
my
dress
i
had
now
leisure
to
reflect
i
seated
myself
on
the
ground
and
reviewed
the
scenes
through
which
i
had
just
passed
i
began
to
think
that
my
industry
had
been
misemployed
suppose
i
had
met
the
person
on
his
first
entrance
into
his
chamber
was
the
truth
so
utterly
wild
as
not
to
have
found
credit
since
the
door
was
locked
and
there
was
no
other
avenue
what
other
statement
but
the
true
one
would
account
for
my
being
found
there
this
deportment
had
been
worthy
of
an
honest
purpose
my
betrayer
probably
expected
that
this
would
be
the
issue
of
his
jest
my
rustic
simplicity
he
might
think
would
suggest
no
more
ambiguous
or
elaborate
expedient
he
might
likewise
have
predetermined
to
interfere
if
my
safety
had
been
really
endangered
on
the
morrow
the
two
doors
of
the
chamber
and
the
window
below
would
be
found
unclosed
they
will
suspect
a
design
to
pillage
but
their
searches
will
terminate
in
nothing
but
in
the
discovery
of
a
pair
of
clumsy
and
dusty
shoes
in
the
closet
now
that
i
was
safe
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
picture
which
my
fancy
drew
of
their
anxiety
and
wonder
these
thoughts
however
gave
place
to
more
momentous
considerations
i
could
not
imagine
to
myself
a
more
perfect
example
of
indigence
than
i
now
exhibited
there
was
no
being
in
the
city
on
whose
kindness
i
had
any
claim
money
i
had
none
and
what
i
then
wore
comprised
my
whole
stock
of
movables
i
had
just
lost
my
shoes
and
this
loss
rendered
my
stockings
of
no
use
my
dignity
remonstrated
against
a
barefoot
pilgrimage
but
to
this
necessity
now
reconciled
me
i
threw
my
stockings
between
the
bars
of
a
stable-window
belonging
as
i
thought
to
the
mansion
i
had
just
left
these
together
with
my
shoes
i
left
to
pay
the
cost
of
my
entertainment
i
saw
that
the
city
was
no
place
for
me
the
end
that
i
had
had
in
view
of
procuring
some
mechanical
employment
could
only
be
obtained
by
the
use
of
means
but
what
means
to
pursue
i
knew
not
this
night's
perils
and
deceptions
gave
me
a
distaste
to
a
city
life
and
my
ancient
occupations
rose
to
my
view
enhanced
by
a
thousand
imaginary
charms
i
resolved
forthwith
to
strike
into
the
country
the
day
began
now
to
dawn
it
was
sunday
and
i
was
desirous
of
eluding
observation
i
was
somewhat
recruited
by
rest
though
the
languors
of
sleeplessness
oppressed
me
i
meant
to
throw
myself
on
the
first
lap
of
verdure
i
should
meet
and
indulge
in
sleep
that
i
so
much
wanted
i
knew
not
the
direction
of
the
streets
but
followed
that
which
i
first
entered
from
the
court
trusting
that
by
adhering
steadily
to
one
course
i
should
some
time
reach
the
fields
this
street
as
i
afterwards
found
tended
to
schuylkill
and
soon
extricated
me
from
houses
i
could
not
cross
this
river
without
payment
of
toll
it
was
requisite
to
cross
it
in
order
to
reach
that
part
of
the
country
whither
i
was
desirous
of
going
but
how
should
i
effect
my
passage
i
knew
of
no
ford
and
the
smallest
expense
exceeded
my
capacity
ten
thousand
guineas
and
a
farthing
were
equally
remote
from
nothing
and
nothing
was
the
portion
allotted
to
me
while
my
mind
was
thus
occupied
i
turned
up
one
of
the
streets
which
tend
northward
it
was
for
some
length
uninhabited
and
unpaved
presently
i
reached
a
pavement
and
a
painted
fence
along
which
a
row
of
poplars
was
planted
it
bounded
a
garden
into
which
a
knot-hole
permitted
me
to
pry
the
enclosure
was
a
charming
green
which
i
saw
appended
to
a
house
of
the
loftiest
and
most
stately
order
it
seemed
like
a
recent
erection
had
all
the
gloss
of
novelty
and
exhibited
to
my
unpractised
eyes
the
magnificence
of
palaces
my
father's
dwelling
did
not
equal
the
height
of
one
story
and
might
be
easily
comprised
in
one-fourth
of
those
buildings
which
here
were
designed
to
accommodate
the
menials
my
heart
dictated
the
comparison
between
my
own
condition
and
that
of
the
proprietors
of
this
domain
how
wide
and
how
impassable
was
the
gulf
by
which
we
were
separated
this
fair
inheritance
had
fallen
to
one
who
perhaps
would
only
abuse
it
to
the
purposes
of
luxury
while
i
with
intentions
worthy
of
the
friend
of
mankind
was
doomed
to
wield
the
flail
and
the
mattock
i
had
been
entirely
unaccustomed
to
this
strain
of
reflection
my
books
had
taught
me
the
dignity
and
safety
of
the
middle
path
and
my
darling
writer
abounded
with
encomiums
on
rural
life
at
a
distance
from
luxury
and
pomp
i
viewed
them
perhaps
in
a
just
light
a
nearer
scrutiny
confirmed
my
early
prepossessions
but
at
the
distance
at
which
i
now
stood
the
lofty
edifices
the
splendid
furniture
and
the
copious
accommodations
of
the
rich
excited
my
admiration
and
my
envy
i
relinquished
my
station
and
proceeded
in
a
heartless
mood
along
the
fence
i
now
came
to
the
mansion
itself
the
principal
door
was
entered
by
a
staircase
of
marble
i
had
never
seen
the
stone
of
carrara
and
wildly
supposed
this
to
have
been
dug
from
italian
quarries
the
beauty
of
the
poplars
the
coolness
exhaled
from
the
dew-besprent
bricks
the
commodiousness
of
the
seat
which
these
steps
afforded
and
the
uncertainty
into
which
i
was
plunged
respecting
my
future
conduct
all
combined
to
make
me
pause
i
sat
down
on
the
lower
step
and
began
to
meditate
by
some
transition
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
supply
of
my
most
urgent
wants
might
be
found
in
some
inhabitant
of
this
house
i
needed
at
present
a
few
cents
and
what
were
a
few
cents
to
the
tenant
of
a
mansion
like
this
i
had
an
invincible
aversion
to
the
calling
of
a
beggar
but
i
regarded
with
still
more
antipathy
the
vocation
of
a
thief
to
this
alternative
however
i
was
now
reduced
i
must
either
steal
or
beg
unless
indeed
assistance
could
be
procured
under
the
notion
of
a
loan
would
a
stranger
refuse
to
lend
the
pittance
that
i
wanted
surely
not
when
the
urgency
of
my
wants
was
explained
i
recollected
other
obstacles
to
summon
the
master
of
the
house
from
his
bed
perhaps
for
the
sake
of
such
an
application
would
be
preposterous
i
should
be
in
more
danger
of
provoking
his
anger
than
exciting
his
benevolence
this
request
might
surely
with
more
propriety
be
preferred
to
a
passenger
i
should
probably
meet
several
before
i
should
arrive
at
schuylkill
a
servant
just
then
appeared
at
the
door
with
bucket
and
brush
this
obliged
me
much
sooner
than
i
intended
to
decamp
with
some
reluctance
i
rose
and
proceeded
this
house
occupied
the
corner
of
the
street
and
i
now
turned
this
corner
towards
the
country
a
person
at
some
distance
before
me
was
approaching
in
an
opposite
direction
why
said
i
may
i
not
make
my
demand
of
the
first
man
i
meet
this
person
exhibits
tokens
of
ability
to
lend
there
is
nothing
chilling
or
austere
in
his
demeanour
the
resolution
to
address
this
passenger
was
almost
formed
but
the
nearer
he
advanced
my
resolves
grew
less
firm
he
noticed
me
not
till
he
came
within
a
few
paces
he
seemed
busy
in
reflection
and
had
not
my
figure
caught
his
eye
or
had
he
merely
bestowed
a
passing
glance
upon
me
i
should
not
have
been
sufficiently
courageous
to
have
detained
him
the
event
however
was
widely
different
he
looked
at
me
and
started
for
an
instant
as
it
were
and
till
he
had
time
to
dart
at
me
a
second
glance
he
checked
his
pace
this
behaviour
decided
mine
and
he
stopped
on
perceiving
tokens
of
a
desire
to
address
him
i
spoke
but
my
accents
and
air
sufficiently
denoted
my
embarrassments--
i
am
going
to
solicit
a
favour
which
my
situation
makes
of
the
highest
importance
to
me
and
which
i
hope
it
will
be
easy
for
you
sir
to
grant
it
is
not
an
alms
but
a
loan
that
i
seek
a
loan
that
i
will
repay
the
moment
i
am
able
to
do
it
i
am
going
to
the
country
but
have
not
wherewith
to
pay
my
passage
over
schuylkill
or
to
buy
a
morsel
of
bread
may
i
venture
to
request
of
you
sir
the
loan
of
sixpence
as
i
told
you
it
is
my
intention
to
repay
it
i
delivered
this
address
not
without
some
faltering
but
with
great
earnestness
i
laid
particular
stress
upon
my
intention
to
refund
the
money
he
listened
with
a
most
inquisitive
air
his
eye
perused
me
from
head
to
foot
after
some
pause
he
said
in
a
very
emphatic
manner
why
into
the
country
have
you
family
kindred
friends
no
answered
i
i
have
neither
i
go
in
search
of
the
means
of
subsistence
i
have
passed
my
life
upon
a
farm
and
propose
to
die
in
the
same
condition
whence
have
you
come
i
came
yesterday
from
the
country
with
a
view
to
earn
my
bread
in
some
way
but
have
changed
my
plan
and
propose
now
to
return
why
have
you
changed
it
in
what
way
are
you
capable
of
earning
your
bread
i
hardly
know
said
i
i
can
as
yet
manage
no
tool
that
can
be
managed
in
the
city
but
the
pen
my
habits
have
in
some
small
degree
qualified
me
for
a
writer
i
would
willingly
accept
employment
of
that
kind
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
earth
and
was
silent
for
some
minutes
at
length
recovering
himself
he
said
follow
me
to
my
house
perhaps
something
may
be
done
for
you
if
not
i
will
lend
you
sixpence
it
may
be
supposed
that
i
eagerly
complied
with
the
invitation
my
companion
said
no
more
his
air
bespeaking
him
to
be
absorbed
by
his
own
thoughts
till
he
reached
his
house
which
proved
to
be
that
at
the
door
of
which
i
had
been
seated
we
entered
a
parlour
together
unless
you
can
assume
my
ignorance
and
my
simplicity
you
will
be
unable
to
conceive
the
impressions
that
were
made
by
the
size
and
ornaments
of
this
apartment
i
shall
omit
these
impressions
which
indeed
no
description
could
adequately
convey
and
dwell
on
incidents
of
greater
moment
he
asked
me
to
give
him
a
specimen
of
my
penmanship
i
told
you
that
i
had
bestowed
very
great
attention
upon
this
art
implements
were
brought
and
i
sat
down
to
the
task
by
some
inexplicable
connection
a
line
in
shakspeare
occurred
to
me
and
i
wrote--
my
poverty
but
not
my
will
consents
the
sentiment
conveyed
in
this
line
powerfully
affected
him
but
in
a
way
which
i
could
not
then
comprehend
i
collected
from
subsequent
events
that
the
inference
was
not
unfavourable
to
my
understanding
or
my
morals
he
questioned
me
as
to
my
history
i
related
my
origin
and
my
inducements
to
desert
my
father's
house
with
respect
to
last
night's
adventures
i
was
silent
i
saw
no
useful
purpose
that
could
be
answered
by
disclosure
and
i
half
suspected
that
my
companion
would
refuse
credit
to
my
tale
there
were
frequent
intervals
of
abstraction
and
reflection
between
his
questions
my
examination
lasted
not
much
less
than
an
hour
at
length
he
said
i
want
an
amanuensis
or
copyist
on
what
terms
will
you
live
with
me
i
answered
that
i
knew
not
how
to
estimate
the
value
of
my
services
i
knew
not
whether
these
services
were
agreeable
or
healthful
my
life
had
hitherto
been
active
my
constitution
was
predisposed
to
diseases
of
the
lungs
and
the
change
might
be
hurtful
i
was
willing
however
to
try
and
to
content
myself
for
a
month
or
a
year
with
so
much
as
would
furnish
me
with
food
clothing
and
lodging
'tis
well
said
he
you
remain
with
me
as
long
and
no
longer
than
both
of
us
please
you
shall
lodge
and
eat
in
this
house
i
will
supply
you
with
clothing
and
your
task
will
be
to
write
what
i
dictate
your
person
i
see
has
not
shared
much
of
your
attention
it
is
in
my
power
to
equip
you
instantly
in
the
manner
which
becomes
a
resident
in
this
house
come
with
me
he
led
the
way
into
the
court
behind
and
thence
into
a
neat
building
which
contained
large
wooden
vessels
and
a
pump
there
said
he
you
may
wash
yourself
and
when
that
is
done
i
will
conduct
you
to
your
chamber
and
your
wardrobe
this
was
speedily
performed
and
he
accordingly
led
the
way
to
the
chamber
it
was
an
apartment
in
the
third
story
finished
and
furnished
in
the
same
costly
and
superb
style
with
the
rest
of
the
house
he
opened
closets
and
drawers
which
overflowed
with
clothes
and
linen
of
all
and
of
the
best
kinds
these
are
yours
said
he
as
long
as
you
stay
with
me
dress
yourself
as
likes
you
best
here
is
every
thing
your
nakedness
requires
when
dressed
you
may
descend
to
breakfast
with
these
words
he
left
me
the
clothes
were
all
in
the
french
style
as
i
afterwards
by
comparing
my
garb
with
that
of
others
discovered
they
were
fitted
to
my
shape
with
the
nicest
precision
i
bedecked
myself
with
all
my
care
i
remembered
the
style
of
dress
used
by
my
beloved
clavering
my
locks
were
of
shining
auburn
flowing
and
smooth
like
his
having
wrung
the
wet
from
them
and
combed
i
tied
them
carelessly
in
a
black
riband
thus
equipped
i
surveyed
myself
in
a
mirror
you
may
imagine
if
you
can
the
sensations
which
this
instantaneous
transformation
produced
appearances
are
wonderfully
influenced
by
dress
check
shirt
buttoned
at
the
neck
an
awkward
fustian
coat
check
trowsers
and
bare
feet
were
now
supplanted
by
linen
and
muslin
nankeen
coat
striped
with
green
a
white
silk
waistcoat
elegantly
needle-wrought
cassimere
pantaloons
stockings
of
variegated
silk
and
shoes
that
in
their
softness
pliancy
and
polished
surface
vied
with
satin
i
could
scarcely
forbear
looking
back
to
see
whether
the
image
in
the
glass
so
well
proportioned
so
gallant
and
so
graceful
did
not
belong
to
another
i
could
scarcely
recognise
any
lineaments
of
my
own
i
walked
to
the
window
twenty
minutes
ago
said
i
i
was
traversing
that
path
a
barefoot
beggar
now
i
am
thus
again
i
surveyed
myself
surely
some
insanity
has
fastened
on
my
understanding
my
senses
are
the
sport
of
dreams
some
magic
that
disdains
the
cumbrousness
of
nature's
progress
has
wrought
this
change
i
was
roused
from
these
doubts
by
a
summons
to
breakfast
obsequiously
delivered
by
a
black
servant
i
found
welbeck
for
i
shall
henceforth
call
him
by
his
true
name
at
the
breakfast-table
a
superb
equipage
of
silver
and
china
was
before
him
he
was
startled
at
my
entrance
the
change
in
my
dress
seemed
for
a
moment
to
have
deceived
him
his
eye
was
frequently
fixed
upon
me
with
unusual
steadfastness
at
these
times
there
was
inquietude
and
wonder
in
his
features
i
had
now
an
opportunity
of
examining
my
host
there
was
nicety
but
no
ornament
in
his
dress
his
form
was
of
the
middle
height
spare
but
vigorous
and
graceful
his
face
was
cast
i
thought
in
a
foreign
mould
his
forehead
receded
beyond
the
usual
degree
in
visages
which
i
had
seen
his
eyes
large
and
prominent
but
imparting
no
marks
of
benignity
and
habitual
joy
the
rest
of
his
face
forcibly
suggested
the
idea
of
a
convex
edge
his
whole
figure
impressed
me
with
emotions
of
veneration
and
awe
a
gravity
that
almost
amounted
to
sadness
invariably
attended
him
when
we
were
alone
together
he
whispered
the
servant
that
waited
who
immediately
retired
he
then
said
turning
to
me
a
lady
will
enter
presently
whom
you
are
to
treat
with
the
respect
due
to
my
daughter
you
must
not
notice
any
emotion
she
may
betray
at
the
sight
of
you
nor
expect
her
to
converse
with
you
for
she
does
not
understand
your
language
he
had
scarcely
spoken
when
she
entered
i
was
seized
with
certain
misgivings
and
flutterings
which
a
clownish
education
may
account
for
i
so
far
conquered
my
timidity
however
as
to
snatch
a
look
at
her
i
was
not
born
to
execute
her
portrait
perhaps
the
turban
that
wreathed
her
head
the
brilliant
texture
and
inimitable
folds
of
her
drapery
and
nymphlike
port
more
than
the
essential
attributes
of
her
person
gave
splendour
to
the
celestial
vision
perhaps
it
was
her
snowy
hues
and
the
cast
rather
than
the
position
of
her
features
that
were
so
prolific
of
enchantment
or
perhaps
the
wonder
originated
only
in
my
own
ignorance
she
did
not
immediately
notice
me
when
she
did
she
almost
shrieked
with
surprise
she
held
up
her
hands
and
gazing
upon
me
uttered
various
exclamations
which
i
could
not
understand
i
could
only
remark
that
her
accents
were
thrillingly
musical
her
perturbations
refused
to
be
stilled
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
withdrew
her
regards
from
me
much
conversation
passed
between
her
and
welbeck
but
i
could
comprehend
no
part
of
it
i
was
at
liberty
to
animadvert
on
the
visible
part
of
their
intercourse
i
diverted
some
part
of
my
attention
from
my
own
embarrassments
and
fixed
it
on
their
looks
in
this
art
as
in
most
others
i
was
an
unpractised
simpleton
in
the
countenance
of
welbeck
there
was
somewhat
else
than
sympathy
with
the
astonishment
and
distress
of
the
lady
but
i
could
not
interpret
these
additional
tokens
when
her
attention
was
engrossed
by
welbeck
her
eyes
were
frequently
vagrant
or
downcast
her
cheeks
contracted
a
deeper
hue
and
her
breathing
was
almost
prolonged
into
a
sigh
these
were
marks
on
which
i
made
no
comments
at
the
time
my
own
situation
was
calculated
to
breed
confusion
in
my
thoughts
and
awkwardness
in
my
gestures
breakfast
being
finished
the
lady
apparently
at
the
request
of
welbeck
sat
down
to
a
piano-forte
here
again
i
must
be
silent
i
was
not
wholly
destitute
of
musical
practice
and
musical
taste
i
had
that
degree
of
knowledge
which
enabled
me
to
estimate
the
transcendent
skill
of
this
performer
as
if
the
pathos
of
her
touch
were
insufficient
i
found
after
some
time
that
the
lawless
jarrings
of
the
keys
were
chastened
by
her
own
more
liquid
notes
she
played
without
a
book
and
though
her
bass
might
be
preconcerted
it
was
plain
that
her
right-hand
notes
were
momentary
and
spontaneous
inspirations
meanwhile
welbeck
stood
leaning
his
arms
on
the
back
of
a
chair
near
her
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
face
his
features
were
fraught
with
a
meaning
which
i
was
eager
to
interpret
but
unable
i
have
read
of
transitions
effected
by
magic
i
have
read
of
palaces
and
deserts
which
were
subject
to
the
dominion
of
spells
poets
may
sport
with
their
power
but
i
am
certain
that
no
transition
was
ever
conceived
more
marvellous
and
more
beyond
the
reach
of
foresight
than
that
which
i
had
just
experienced
heaths
vexed
by
a
midnight
storm
may
be
changed
into
a
hall
of
choral
nymphs
and
regal
banqueting
forest
glades
may
give
sudden
place
to
colonnades
and
carnivals
but
he
whose
senses
are
deluded
finds
himself
still
on
his
natal
earth
these
miracles
are
contemptible
when
compared
with
that
which
placed
me
under
this
roof
and
gave
me
to
partake
in
this
audience
i
know
that
my
emotions
are
in
danger
of
being
regarded
as
ludicrous
by
those
who
cannot
figure
to
themselves
the
consequences
of
a
limited
and
rustic
education
in
a
short
time
the
lady
retired
i
naturally
expected
that
some
comments
would
be
made
on
her
behaviour
and
that
the
cause
of
her
surprise
and
distress
on
seeing
me
would
be
explained
but
welbeck
said
nothing
on
that
subject
when
she
had
gone
he
went
to
the
window
and
stood
for
some
time
occupied
as
it
seemed
with
his
own
thoughts
then
he
turned
to
me
and
calling
me
by
my
name
desired
me
to
accompany
him
up-stairs
there
was
neither
cheerfulness
nor
mildness
in
his
address
but
neither
was
there
any
thing
domineering
or
arrogant
we
entered
an
apartment
on
the
same
floor
with
my
chamber
but
separated
from
it
by
a
spacious
entry
it
was
supplied
with
bureaus
cabinets
and
bookcases
this
said
he
is
your
room
and
mine
but
we
must
enter
it
and
leave
it
together
i
mean
to
act
not
as
your
master
but
your
friend
my
maimed
hand
so
saying
he
showed
me
his
right
hand
the
forefinger
of
which
was
wanting
will
not
allow
me
to
write
accurately
or
copiously
for
this
reason
i
have
required
your
aid
in
a
work
of
some
moment
much
haste
will
not
be
requisite
and
as
to
the
hours
and
duration
of
employment
these
will
be
seasonable
and
short
your
present
situation
is
new
to
you
and
we
will
therefore
defer
entering
on
our
business
meanwhile
you
may
amuse
yourself
in
what
manner
you
please
consider
this
house
as
your
home
and
make
yourself
familiar
with
it
stay
within
or
go
out
be
busy
or
be
idle
as
your
fancy
shall
prompt
only
you
will
conform
to
our
domestic
system
as
to
eating
and
sleep
the
servants
will
inform
you
of
this
next
week
we
will
enter
on
the
task
for
which
i
designed
you
you
may
now
withdraw
i
obeyed
this
mandate
with
some
awkwardness
and
hesitation
i
went
into
my
own
chamber
not
displeased
with
an
opportunity
of
loneliness
i
threw
myself
on
a
chair
and
resigned
myself
to
those
thoughts
which
would
naturally
arise
in
this
situation
i
speculated
on
the
character
and
views
of
welbeck
i
saw
that
he
was
embosomed
in
tranquillity
and
grandeur
riches
therefore
were
his
but
in
what
did
his
opulence
consist
and
whence
did
it
arise
what
were
the
limits
by
which
it
was
confined
and
what
its
degree
of
permanence
i
was
unhabituated
to
ideas
of
floating
or
transferable
wealth
the
rent
of
houses
and
lands
was
the
only
species
of
property
which
was
as
yet
perfectly
intelligible
my
previous
ideas
led
me
to
regard
welbeck
as
the
proprietor
of
this
dwelling
and
of
numerous
houses
and
farms
by
the
same
cause
i
was
fain
to
suppose
him
enriched
by
inheritance
and
that
his
life
had
been
uniform
i
next
adverted
to
his
social
condition
this
mansion
appeared
to
have
but
two
inhabitants
besides
servants
who
was
the
nymph
who
had
hovered
for
a
moment
in
my
sight
had
he
not
called
her
his
daughter
the
apparent
difference
in
their
ages
would
justify
this
relation
but
her
guise
her
features
and
her
accents
were
foreign
her
language
i
suspected
strongly
to
be
that
of
italy
how
should
he
be
the
father
of
an
italian
but
were
there
not
some
foreign
lineaments
in
his
countenance
this
idea
seemed
to
open
a
new
world
to
my
view
i
had
gained
from
my
books
confused
ideas
of
european
governments
and
manners
i
knew
that
the
present
was
a
period
of
revolution
and
hostility
might
not
these
be
illustrious
fugitives
from
provence
or
the
milanese
their
portable
wealth
which
may
reasonably
be
supposed
to
be
great
they
have
transported
hither
thus
may
be
explained
the
sorrow
that
veils
their
countenance
the
loss
of
estates
and
honours
the
untimely
death
of
kindred
and
perhaps
of
his
wife
may
furnish
eternal
food
for
regrets
welbeck's
utterance
though
rapid
and
distinct
partook
as
i
conceived
in
some
very
slight
degree
of
a
foreign
idiom
such
was
the
dream
that
haunted
my
undisciplined
and
unenlightened
imagination
the
more
i
revolved
it
the
more
plausible
it
seemed
on
due
supposition
every
appearance
that
i
had
witnessed
was
easily
solved--unless
it
were
their
treatment
of
me
this
at
first
was
a
source
of
hopeless
perplexity
gradually
however
a
clue
seemed
to
be
afforded
welbeck
had
betrayed
astonishment
on
my
first
appearance
the
lady's
wonder
was
mingled
with
distress
perhaps
they
discovered
a
remarkable
resemblance
between
me
and
one
who
stood
in
the
relation
of
son
to
welbeck
and
of
brother
to
the
lady
this
youth
might
have
perished
on
the
scaffold
or
in
war
these
no
doubt
were
his
clothes
this
chamber
might
have
been
reserved
for
him
but
his
death
left
it
to
be
appropriated
to
another
i
had
hitherto
been
unable
to
guess
at
the
reason
why
all
this
kindness
had
been
lavished
on
me
will
not
this
conjecture
sufficiently
account
for
it
no
wonder
that
this
resemblance
was
enhanced
by
assuming
his
dress
taking
all
circumstances
into
view
these
ideas
were
not
perhaps
destitute
of
probability
appearances
naturally
suggested
them
to
me
they
were
also
powerfully
enforced
by
inclination
they
threw
me
into
transports
of
wonder
and
hope
when
i
dwelt
upon
the
incidents
of
my
past
life
and
traced
the
chain
of
events
from
the
death
of
my
mother
to
the
present
moment
i
almost
acquiesced
in
the
notion
that
some
beneficent
and
ruling
genius
had
prepared
my
path
for
me
events
which
when
foreseen
would
most
ardently
have
been
deprecated
and
when
they
happened
were
accounted
in
the
highest
degree
luckless
were
now
seen
to
be
propitious
hence
i
inferred
the
infatuation
of
despair
and
the
folly
of
precipitate
conclusions
but
what
was
the
fate
reserved
for
me
perhaps
welbeck
would
adopt
me
for
his
own
son
wealth
has
ever
been
capriciously
distributed
the
mere
physical
relation
of
birth
is
all
that
entitles
us
to
manors
and
thrones
identity
itself
frequently
depends
upon
a
casual
likeness
or
an
old
nurse's
imposture
nations
have
risen
in
arms
as
in
the
case
of
the
stuarts
in
the
cause
of
one
the
genuineness
of
whose
birth
has
been
denied
and
can
never
be
proved
but
if
the
cause
be
trivial
and
fallacious
the
effects
are
momentous
and
solid
it
ascertains
our
portion
of
felicity
and
usefulness
and
fixes
our
lot
among
peasants
or
princes
something
may
depend
upon
my
own
deportment
will
it
not
behoove
me
to
cultivate
all
my
virtues
and
eradicate
all
my
defects
i
see
that
the
abilities
of
this
man
are
venerable
perhaps
he
will
not
lightly
or
hastily
decide
in
my
favour
he
will
be
governed
by
the
proofs
that
i
shall
give
of
discernment
and
integrity
i
had
always
been
exempt
from
temptation
and
was
therefore
undepraved
but
this
view
of
things
had
a
wonderful
tendency
to
invigorate
my
virtuous
resolutions
all
within
me
was
exhilaration
and
joy
there
was
but
one
thing
wanting
to
exalt
me
to
a
dizzy
height
and
give
me
place
among
the
stars
of
heaven
my
resemblance
to
her
brother
had
forcibly
affected
this
lady
but
i
was
not
her
brother
i
was
raised
to
a
level
with
her
and
made
a
tenant
of
the
same
mansion
some
intercourse
would
take
place
between
us
time
would
lay
level
impediments
and
establish
familiarity
and
this
intercourse
might
foster
love
and
terminate
in--marriage
these
images
were
of
a
nature
too
glowing
and
expansive
to
allow
me
to
be
longer
inactive
i
sallied
forth
into
the
open
air
this
tumult
of
delicious
thoughts
in
some
time
subsided
and
gave
way
to
images
relative
to
my
present
situation
my
curiosity
was
awake
as
yet
i
had
seen
little
of
the
city
and
this
opportunity
for
observation
was
not
to
be
neglected
i
therefore
coursed
through
several
streets
attentively
examining
the
objects
that
successively
presented
themselves
at
length
it
occurred
to
me
to
search
out
the
house
in
which
i
had
lately
been
immured
i
was
not
without
hopes
that
at
some
future
period
i
should
be
able
to
comprehend
the
allusions
and
brighten
the
obscurities
that
hung
about
the
dialogue
of
last
night
the
house
was
easily
discovered
i
reconnoitred
the
court
and
gate
through
which
i
had
passed
the
mansion
was
of
the
first
order
in
magnitude
and
decoration
this
was
not
the
bound
of
my
present
discovery
for
i
was
gifted
with
that
confidence
which
would
make
me
set
on
foot
inquiries
in
the
neighbourhood
i
looked
around
for
a
suitable
medium
of
intelligence
the
opposite
and
adjoining
houses
were
small
and
apparently
occupied
by
persons
of
an
indigent
class
at
one
of
these
was
a
sign
denoting
it
to
be
the
residence
of
a
tailor
seated
on
a
bench
at
the
door
was
a
young
man
with
coarse
uncombed
locks
breeches
knee-unbuttoned
stockings
ungartered
shoes
slipshod
and
unbuckled
and
a
face
unwashed
gazing
stupidly
from
hollow
eyes
his
aspect
was
embellished
with
good
nature
though
indicative
of
ignorance
this
was
the
only
person
in
sight
he
might
be
able
to
say
something
concerning
his
opulent
neighbour
to
him
therefore
i
resolved
to
apply
i
went
up
to
him
and
pointing
to
the
house
in
question
asked
him
who
lived
there
he
answered
mr
matthews
what
is
his
profession--his
way
of
life
a
gentleman
he
does
nothing
but
walk
about
how
long
has
he
been
married
married
he
is
not
married
as
i
know
on
he
never
has
been
married
he
is
a
bachelor
this
intelligence
was
unexpected
it
made
me
pause
to
reflect
whether
i
had
not
mistaken
the
house
this
however
seemed
impossible
i
renewed
my
questions
a
bachelor
say
you
are
you
not
mistaken
no
it
would
be
an
odd
thing
if
he
was
married
an
old
fellow
with
one
foot
in
the
grave--comical
enough
for
him
to
git
a
vife
an
old
man
does
he
live
alone
what
is
his
family
no
he
does
not
live
alone
he
has
a
niece
that
lives
with
him
she
is
married
and
her
husband
lives
there
too
what
is
his
name
i
don't
know
i
never
heard
it
as
i
know
on
what
is
his
trade
he's
a
merchant
he
keeps
a
store
somewhere
or
other
but
i
don't
know
where
how
long
has
he
been
married
about
two
years
they
lost
a
child
lately
the
young
woman
was
in
a
huge
taking
about
it
they
say
she
was
quite
crazy
some
days
for
the
death
of
the
child
and
she
is
not
quite
out
of
the
dumps
yet
to-be-sure
the
child
was
a
sweet
little
thing
but
they
need
not
make
such
a
rout
about
it
i'll
war'n'
they'll
have
enough
of
them
before
they
die
what
is
the
character
of
the
young
man
where
was
he
born
and
educated
has
he
parents
or
brothers
my
companion
was
incapable
of
answering
these
questions
and
i
left
him
with
little
essential
addition
to
the
knowledge
i
already
possessed
after
viewing
various
parts
of
the
city
intruding
into
churches
and
diving
into
alleys
i
returned
the
rest
of
the
day
i
spent
chiefly
in
my
chamber
reflecting
on
my
new
condition
surveying
my
apartment
its
presses
and
closets
and
conjecturing
the
causes
of
appearances
at
dinner
and
supper
i
was
alone
venturing
to
inquire
of
the
servant
where
his
master
and
mistress
were
i
was
answered
that
they
were
engaged
i
did
not
question
him
as
to
the
nature
of
their
engagement
though
it
was
a
fertile
source
of
curiosity
next
morning
at
breakfast
i
again
met
welbeck
and
the
lady
the
incidents
were
nearly
those
of
the
preceding
morning
if
it
were
not
that
the
lady
exhibited
tokens
of
somewhat
greater
uneasiness
when
she
left
us
welbeck
sank
into
apparent
meditation
i
was
at
a
loss
whether
to
retire
or
remain
where
i
was
at
last
however
i
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room
when
he
broke
silence
and
began
a
conversation
with
me
he
put
questions
to
me
the
obvious
scope
of
which
was
to
know
my
sentiments
on
moral
topics
i
had
no
motives
to
conceal
my
opinions
and
therefore
delivered
them
with
frankness
at
length
he
introduced
allusions
to
my
own
history
and
made
more
particular
inquiries
on
that
head
here
i
was
not
equally
frank
yet
i
did
not
feign
any
thing
but
merely
dealt
in
generals
i
had
acquired
notions
of
propriety
on
this
head
perhaps
somewhat
fastidious
minute
details
respecting
our
own
concerns
are
apt
to
weary
all
but
the
narrator
himself
i
said
thus
much
and
the
truth
of
my
remark
was
eagerly
assented
to
with
some
marks
of
hesitation
and
after
various
preliminaries
my
companion
hinted
that
my
own
interest
as
well
as
his
enjoined
upon
me
silence
to
all
but
himself
on
the
subject
of
my
birth
and
early
adventures
it
was
not
likely
that
while
in
his
service
my
circle
of
acquaintance
would
be
large
or
my
intercourse
with
the
world
frequent
but
in
my
communication
with
others
he
requested
me
to
speak
rather
of
others
than
of
myself
this
request
he
said
might
appear
singular
to
me
but
he
had
his
reasons
for
making
it
which
it
was
not
necessary
at
present
to
disclose
though
when
i
should
know
them
i
should
readily
acknowledge
their
validity
i
scarcely
knew
what
answer
to
make
i
was
willing
to
oblige
him
i
was
far
from
expecting
that
any
exigence
would
occur
making
disclosure
my
duty
the
employment
was
productive
of
pain
more
than
of
pleasure
and
the
curiosity
that
would
uselessly
seek
a
knowledge
of
my
past
life
was
no
less
impertinent
than
the
loquacity
that
would
uselessly
communicate
that
knowledge
i
readily
promised
therefore
to
adhere
to
his
advice
this
assurance
afforded
him
evident
satisfaction
yet
it
did
not
seem
to
amount
to
quite
as
much
as
he
wished
he
repeated
in
stronger
terms
the
necessity
there
was
for
caution
he
was
far
from
suspecting
me
to
possess
an
impertinent
and
talkative
disposition
or
that
in
my
eagerness
to
expatiate
on
my
own
concerns
i
should
overstep
the
limits
of
politeness
but
this
was
not
enough
i
was
to
govern
myself
by
a
persuasion
that
the
interests
of
my
friend
and
myself
would
be
materially
affected
by
my
conduct
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
allowed
these
insinuations
to
breed
suspicion
in
my
mind
but
conscious
as
i
was
of
the
benefits
which
i
had
received
from
this
man
prone
from
my
inexperience
to
rely
upon
professions
and
confide
in
appearances
and
unaware
that
i
could
be
placed
in
any
condition
in
which
mere
silence
respecting
myself
could
be
injurious
or
criminal
i
made
no
scruple
to
promise
compliance
with
his
wishes
nay
i
went
further
than
this
i
desired
to
be
accurately
informed
as
to
what
it
was
proper
to
conceal
he
answered
that
my
silence
might
extend
to
every
thing
anterior
to
my
arrival
in
the
city
and
my
being
incorporated
with
his
family
here
our
conversation
ended
and
i
retired
to
ruminate
on
what
had
passed
i
derived
little
satisfaction
from
my
reflections
i
began
now
to
perceive
inconveniences
that
might
arise
from
this
precipitate
promise
whatever
should
happen
in
consequence
of
my
being
immured
in
the
chamber
and
of
the
loss
of
my
clothes
and
of
the
portrait
of
my
friend
i
had
bound
myself
to
silence
these
inquietudes
however
were
transient
i
trusted
that
these
events
would
operate
auspiciously
but
my
curiosity
was
now
awakened
as
to
the
motives
which
welbeck
could
have
for
exacting
from
me
this
concealment
to
act
under
the
guidance
of
another
and
to
wander
in
the
dark
ignorant
whither
my
path
tended
and
what
effects
might
flow
from
my
agency
was
a
new
and
irksome
situation
from
these
thoughts
i
was
recalled
by
a
message
from
welbeck
he
gave
me
a
folded
paper
which
he
requested
me
to
carry
to
no--south
fourth
street
inquire
said
he
for
mrs
wentworth
in
order
merely
to
ascertain
the
house
for
you
need
not
ask
to
see
her
merely
give
the
letter
to
the
servant
and
retire
excuse
me
for
imposing
this
service
upon
you
it
is
of
too
great
moment
to
be
trusted
to
a
common
messenger
i
usually
perform
it
myself
but
am
at
present
otherwise
engaged
i
took
the
letter
and
set
out
to
deliver
it
this
was
a
trifling
circumstance
yet
my
mind
was
full
of
reflections
on
the
consequences
that
might
flow
from
it
i
remembered
the
directions
that
were
given
but
construed
them
in
a
manner
different
perhaps
from
welbeck's
expectations
or
wishes
he
had
charged
me
to
leave
the
billet
with
the
servant
who
happened
to
answer
my
summons
but
had
he
not
said
that
the
message
was
important
insomuch
that
it
could
not
be
intrusted
to
common
hands
he
had
permitted
rather
than
enjoined
me
to
dispense
with
seeing
the
lady
and
this
permission
i
conceived
to
be
dictated
merely
by
regard
to
my
convenience
it
was
incumbent
on
me
therefore
to
take
some
pains
to
deliver
the
script
into
her
own
hands
i
arrived
at
the
house
and
knocked
a
female
servant
appeared
her
mistress
was
up-stairs
she
would
tell
her
if
i
wished
to
see
her
and
meanwhile
invited
me
to
enter
the
parlour
i
did
so
and
the
girl
retired
to
inform
her
mistress
that
one
waited
for
her
i
ought
to
mention
that
my
departure
from
the
directions
which
i
had
received
was
in
some
degree
owing
to
an
inquisitive
temper
i
was
eager
after
knowledge
and
was
disposed
to
profit
by
every
opportunity
to
survey
the
interior
of
dwellings
and
converse
with
their
inhabitants
i
scanned
the
walls
the
furniture
the
pictures
over
the
fireplace
was
a
portrait
in
oil
of
a
female
she
was
elderly
and
matron-like
perhaps
she
was
the
mistress
of
this
habitation
and
the
person
to
whom
i
should
immediately
be
introduced
was
it
a
casual
suggestion
or
was
there
an
actual
resemblance
between
the
strokes
of
the
pencil
which
executed
this
portrait
and
that
of
clavering
however
that
be
the
sight
of
this
picture
revived
the
memory
of
my
friend
and
called
up
a
fugitive
suspicion
that
this
was
the
production
of
his
skill
i
was
busily
revolving
this
idea
when
the
lady
herself
entered
it
was
the
same
whose
portrait
i
had
been
examining
she
fixed
scrutinizing
and
powerful
eyes
upon
me
she
looked
at
the
superscription
of
the
letter
which
i
presented
and
immediately
resumed
her
examination
of
me
i
was
somewhat
abashed
by
the
closeness
of
her
observation
and
gave
tokens
of
this
state
of
mind
which
did
not
pass
unobserved
they
seemed
instantly
to
remind
her
that
she
behaved
with
too
little
regard
to
civility
she
recovered
herself
and
began
to
peruse
the
letter
having
done
this
her
attention
was
once
more
fixed
upon
me
she
was
evidently
desirous
of
entering
into
some
conversation
but
seemed
at
a
loss
in
what
manner
to
begin
this
situation
was
new
to
me
and
was
productive
of
no
small
embarrassment
i
was
preparing
to
take
my
leave
when
she
spoke
though
not
without
considerable
hesitation--
this
letter
is
from
mr
welbeck--you
are
his
friend--i
presume--perhaps--a
relation
i
was
conscious
that
i
had
no
claim
to
either
of
these
titles
and
that
i
was
no
more
than
his
servant
my
pride
would
not
allow
me
to
acknowledge
this
and
i
merely
said
i
live
with
him
at
present
madam
i
imagined
that
this
answer
did
not
perfectly
satisfy
her
yet
she
received
it
with
a
certain
air
of
acquiescence
she
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
rising
said
excuse
me
sir
for
a
few
minutes
i
will
write
a
few
words
to
mr
welbeck
so
saying
she
withdrew
i
returned
to
the
contemplation
of
the
picture
from
this
however
my
attention
was
quickly
diverted
by
a
paper
that
lay
on
the
mantel
a
single
glance
was
sufficient
to
put
my
blood
into
motion
i
started
and
laid
my
hand
upon
the
well-known
packet
it
was
that
which
enclosed
the
portrait
of
clavering
i
unfolded
and
examined
it
with
eagerness
by
what
miracle
came
it
hither
it
was
found
together
with
my
bundle
two
nights
before
i
had
despaired
of
ever
seeing
it
again
and
yet
here
was
the
same
portrait
enclosed
in
the
selfsame
paper
i
have
forborne
to
dwell
upon
the
regret
amounting
to
grief
with
which
i
was
affected
in
consequence
of
the
loss
of
this
precious
relic
my
joy
on
thus
speedily
and
unexpectedly
regaining
it
is
not
easily
described
for
a
time
i
did
not
reflect
that
to
hold
it
thus
in
my
hand
was
not
sufficient
to
entitle
me
to
repossession
i
must
acquaint
this
lady
with
the
history
of
this
picture
and
convince
her
of
my
ownership
but
how
was
this
to
be
done
was
she
connected
in
any
way
by
friendship
or
by
consanguinity
with
that
unfortunate
youth
if
she
were
some
information
as
to
his
destiny
would
be
anxiously
sought
i
did
not
just
then
perceive
any
impropriety
in
imparting
it
if
it
came
into
her
hands
by
accident
still
it
will
be
necessary
to
relate
the
mode
in
which
it
was
lost
in
order
to
prove
my
title
to
it
i
now
heard
her
descending
footsteps
and
hastily
replaced
the
picture
on
the
mantel
she
entered
and
presenting
me
a
letter
desired
me
to
deliver
it
to
mr
welbeck
i
had
no
pretext
for
deferring
my
departure
but
was
unwilling
to
go
without
obtaining
possession
of
the
portrait
an
interval
of
silence
and
irresolution
succeeded
i
cast
significant
glances
at
the
spot
where
it
lay
and
at
length
mustered
up
my
strength
of
mind
and
pointing
to
the
paper--madam
said
i
there
is
something
which
i
recognise
to
be
mine
i
know
not
how
it
came
into
your
possession
but
so
lately
as
the
day
before
yesterday
it
was
in
mine
i
lost
it
by
a
strange
accident
and
as
i
deem
it
of
inestimable
value
i
hope
you
will
have
no
objection
to
restore
it
during
this
speech
the
lady's
countenance
exhibited
marks
of
the
utmost
perturbation
your
picture
she
exclaimed
you
lost
it
how
where
did
you
know
that
person
what
has
become
of
him
i
knew
him
well
said
i
that
picture
was
executed
by
himself
he
gave
it
to
me
with
his
own
hands
and
till
the
moment
i
unfortunately
lost
it
it
was
my
dear
and
perpetual
companion
good
heaven
she
exclaimed
with
increasing
vehemence
where
did
you
meet
with
him
what
has
become
of
him
is
he
dead
or
alive
these
appearances
sufficiently
showed
me
that
clavering
and
this
lady
were
connected
by
some
ties
of
tenderness
i
answered
that
he
was
dead
that
my
mother
and
myself
were
his
attendants
and
nurses
and
that
this
portrait
was
his
legacy
to
me
this
intelligence
melted
her
into
tears
and
it
was
some
time
before
she
recovered
strength
enough
to
resume
the
conversation
she
then
inquired
when
and
where
was
it
that
he
died
how
did
you
lose
this
portrait
it
was
found
wrapped
in
some
coarse
clothes
lying
in
a
stall
in
the
market-house
on
saturday
evening
two
negro
women
servants
of
one
of
my
friends
strolling
through
the
market
found
it
and
brought
it
to
their
mistress
who
recognising
the
portrait
sent
it
to
me
to
whom
did
that
bundle
belong
was
it
yours
these
questions
reminded
me
of
the
painful
predicament
in
which
i
now
stood
i
had
promised
welbeck
to
conceal
from
every
one
my
former
condition
but
to
explain
in
what
manner
this
bundle
was
lost
and
how
my
intercourse
with
clavering
had
taken
place
was
to
violate
this
promise
it
was
possible
perhaps
to
escape
the
confession
of
the
truth
by
equivocation
falsehoods
were
easily
invented
and
might
lead
her
far
away
from
my
true
condition
but
i
was
wholly
unused
to
equivocation
never
yet
had
a
lie
polluted
my
lips
i
was
not
weak
enough
to
be
ashamed
of
my
origin
this
lady
had
an
interest
in
the
fate
of
clavering
and
might
justly
claim
all
the
information
which
i
was
able
to
impart
yet
to
forget
the
compact
which
i
had
so
lately
made
and
an
adherence
to
which
might
possibly
be
in
the
highest
degree
beneficial
to
me
and
to
welbeck
i
was
willing
to
adhere
to
it
provided
falsehood
could
be
avoided
these
thoughts
rendered
me
silent
the
pain
of
my
embarrassment
amounted
almost
to
agony
i
felt
the
keenest
regret
at
my
own
precipitation
in
claiming
the
picture
its
value
to
me
was
altogether
imaginary
the
affection
which
this
lady
had
borne
the
original
whatever
was
the
source
of
that
affection
would
prompt
her
to
cherish
the
copy
and
however
precious
it
was
in
my
eyes
i
should
cheerfully
resign
it
to
her
in
the
confusion
of
my
thoughts
an
expedient
suggested
itself
sufficiently
inartificial
and
bold
it
is
true
madam
what
i
have
said
i
saw
him
breathe
his
last
this
is
his
only
legacy
if
you
wish
it
i
willingly
resign
it
but
this
is
all
that
i
can
now
disclose
i
am
placed
in
circumstances
which
render
it
improper
to
say
more
these
words
were
uttered
not
very
distinctly
and
the
lady's
vehemence
hindered
her
from
noticing
them
she
again
repeated
her
interrogations
to
which
i
returned
the
same
answer
at
first
she
expressed
the
utmost
surprise
at
my
conduct
from
this
she
descended
to
some
degree
of
asperity
she
made
rapid
allusions
to
the
history
of
clavering
he
was
the
son
of
the
gentleman
who
owned
the
house
in
which
welbeck
resided
he
was
the
object
of
immeasurable
fondness
and
indulgence
he
had
sought
permission
to
travel
and
this
being
refused
by
the
absurd
timidity
of
his
parents
he
had
twice
been
frustrated
in
attempting
to
embark
for
europe
clandestinely
they
ascribed
his
disappearance
to
a
third
and
successful
attempt
of
this
kind
and
had
exercised
anxious
and
unwearied
diligence
in
endeavouring
to
trace
his
footsteps
all
their
efforts
had
failed
one
motive
for
their
returning
to
europe
was
the
hope
of
discovering
some
traces
of
him
as
they
entertained
no
doubt
of
his
having
crossed
the
ocean
the
vehemence
of
mrs
wentworth's
curiosity
as
to
those
particulars
of
his
life
and
death
may
be
easily
conceived
my
refusal
only
heightened
this
passion
finding
me
refractory
to
all
her
efforts
she
at
length
dismissed
me
in
anger
this
extraordinary
interview
was
now
past
pleasure
as
well
as
pain
attended
my
reflections
on
it
i
adhered
to
the
promise
i
had
improvidently
given
to
welbeck
but
had
excited
displeasure
and
perhaps
suspicion
in
the
lady
she
would
find
it
hard
to
account
for
my
silence
she
would
probably
impute
it
to
perverseness
or
imagine
it
to
flow
from
some
incident
connected
with
the
death
of
clavering
calculated
to
give
a
new
edge
to
her
curiosity
it
was
plain
that
some
connection
subsisted
between
her
and
welbeck
would
she
drop
the
subject
at
the
point
which
it
had
now
attained
would
she
cease
to
exert
herself
to
extract
from
me
the
desired
information
or
would
she
not
rather
make
welbeck
a
party
in
the
cause
and
prejudice
my
new
friend
against
me
this
was
an
evil
proper
by
all
lawful
means
to
avoid
i
knew
of
no
other
expedient
than
to
confess
to
him
the
truth
with
regard
to
clavering
and
explain
to
him
the
dilemma
in
which
my
adherence
to
my
promise
had
involved
me
i
found
him
on
my
return
home
and
delivered
him
the
letter
with
which
i
was
charged
at
the
sight
of
it
surprise
mingled
with
some
uneasiness
appeared
in
his
looks
what
said
he
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
you
then
saw
the
lady
i
now
remembered
his
directions
to
leave
my
message
at
the
door
and
apologized
for
my
neglecting
them
by
telling
my
reasons
his
chagrin
vanished
but
not
without
an
apparent
effort
and
he
said
that
all
was
well
the
affair
was
of
no
moment
after
a
pause
of
preparation
i
entreated
his
attention
to
something
which
i
had
to
relate
i
then
detailed
the
history
of
clavering
and
of
my
late
embarrassments
as
i
went
on
his
countenance
betokened
increasing
solicitude
his
emotion
was
particularly
strong
when
i
came
to
the
interrogatories
of
mrs
wentworth
in
relation
to
clavering
but
this
emotion
gave
way
to
profound
surprise
when
i
related
the
manner
in
which
i
had
eluded
her
inquiries
i
concluded
with
observing
that
when
i
promised
forbearance
on
the
subject
of
my
own
adventures
i
had
not
foreseen
any
exigence
which
would
make
an
adherence
to
my
promise
difficult
or
inconvenient
that
if
his
interest
was
promoted
by
my
silence
i
was
still
willing
to
maintain
it
and
requested
his
directions
how
to
conduct
myself
on
this
occasion
he
appeared
to
ponder
deeply
and
with
much
perplexity
on
what
i
had
said
when
he
spoke
there
was
hesitation
in
his
manner
and
circuity
in
his
expressions
that
proved
him
to
have
something
in
his
thoughts
which
he
knew
not
how
to
communicate
he
frequently
paused
but
my
answers
and
remarks
occasionally
given
appeared
to
deter
him
from
the
revelation
of
his
purpose
our
discourse
ended
for
the
present
by
his
desiring
me
to
persist
in
my
present
plan
i
should
suffer
no
inconveniences
from
it
since
it
would
be
my
own
fault
if
an
interview
again
took
place
between
the
lady
and
me
meanwhile
he
should
see
her
and
effectually
silence
her
inquiries
i
ruminated
not
superficially
or
briefly
on
this
dialogue
by
what
means
would
he
silence
her
inquiries
he
surely
meant
not
to
mislead
her
by
fallacious
representations
some
inquietude
now
crept
into
my
thoughts
i
began
to
form
conjectures
as
to
the
nature
of
the
scheme
to
which
my
suppression
of
the
truth
was
to
be
thus
made
subservient
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
walking
in
the
dark
and
might
rush
into
snares
or
drop
into
pits
before
i
was
aware
of
my
danger
each
moment
accumulated
my
doubts
and
i
cherished
a
secret
foreboding
that
the
event
would
prove
my
new
situation
to
be
far
less
fortunate
than
i
had
at
first
fondly
believed
the
question
now
occurred
with
painful
repetition
who
and
what
was
welbeck
what
was
his
relation
to
this
foreign
lady
what
was
the
service
for
which
i
was
to
be
employed
i
could
not
be
contented
without
a
solution
of
these
mysteries
why
should
i
not
lay
my
soul
open
before
my
new
friend
considering
my
situation
would
he
regard
my
fears
and
my
surmises
as
criminal
i
felt
that
they
originated
in
laudable
habits
and
views
my
peace
of
mind
depended
on
the
favourable
verdict
which
conscience
should
pass
on
my
proceedings
i
saw
the
emptiness
of
fame
and
luxury
when
put
in
the
balance
against
the
recompense
of
virtue
never
would
i
purchase
the
blandishments
of
adulation
and
the
glare
of
opulence
at
the
price
of
my
honesty
amidst
these
reflections
the
dinner-hour
arrived
the
lady
and
welbeck
were
present
a
new
train
of
sentiments
now
occupied
my
mind
i
regarded
them
both
with
inquisitive
eyes
i
cannot
well
account
for
the
revolution
which
had
taken
place
in
my
mind
perhaps
it
was
a
proof
of
the
capriciousness
of
my
temper
or
it
was
merely
the
fruit
of
my
profound
ignorance
of
life
and
manners
whencesoever
it
arose
certain
it
is
that
i
contemplated
the
scene
before
me
with
altered
eyes
its
order
and
pomp
was
no
longer
the
parent
of
tranquillity
and
awe
my
wild
reveries
of
inheriting
this
splendour
and
appropriating
the
affections
of
this
nymph
i
now
regarded
as
lunatic
hope
and
childish
folly
education
and
nature
had
qualified
me
for
a
different
scene
this
might
be
the
mask
of
misery
and
the
structure
of
vice
my
companions
as
well
as
myself
were
silent
during
the
meal
the
lady
retired
as
soon
as
it
was
finished
my
inexplicable
melancholy
increased
it
did
not
pass
unnoticed
by
welbeck
who
inquired
with
an
air
of
kindness
into
the
cause
of
my
visible
dejection
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
relate
to
what
extremes
my
folly
transported
me
instead
of
answering
him
i
was
weak
enough
to
shed
tears
this
excited
afresh
his
surprise
and
his
sympathy
he
renewed
his
inquiries
my
heart
was
full
but
how
to
disburden
it
i
knew
not
at
length
with
some
difficulty
i
expressed
my
wishes
to
leave
his
house
and
return
into
the
country
what
he
asked
had
occurred
to
suggest
this
new
plan
what
motive
could
incite
me
to
bury
myself
in
rustic
obscurity
how
did
i
purpose
to
dispose
of
myself
had
some
new
friend
sprung
up
more
able
or
more
willing
to
benefit
me
than
he
had
been
no
i
answered
i
have
no
relation
who
would
own
me
or
friend
who
would
protect
if
i
went
into
the
country
it
would
be
to
the
toilsome
occupations
of
a
day-labourer
but
even
that
was
better
than
my
present
situation
this
opinion
he
observed
must
be
newly
formed
what
was
there
irksome
or
offensive
in
my
present
mode
of
life
that
this
man
condescended
to
expostulate
with
me
to
dissuade
me
from
my
new
plan
and
to
enumerate
the
benefits
which
he
was
willing
to
confer
penetrated
my
heart
with
gratitude
i
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
leisure
and
literature
copious
and
elegant
accommodation
were
valuable
for
their
own
sake
that
all
the
delights
of
sensation
and
refinements
of
intelligence
were
comprised
within
my
present
sphere
and
would
be
nearly
wanting
in
that
to
which
i
was
going
i
felt
temporary
compunction
for
my
folly
and
determined
to
adopt
a
different
deportment
i
could
not
prevail
upon
myself
to
unfold
the
true
cause
of
my
dejection
and
permitted
him
therefore
to
ascribe
it
to
a
kind
of
homesickness
to
inexperience
and
to
that
ignorance
which
on
being
ushered
into
a
new
scene
is
oppressed
with
a
sensation
of
forlornness
he
remarked
that
these
chimeras
would
vanish
before
the
influence
of
time
and
company
and
occupation
on
the
next
week
he
would
furnish
me
with
employment
meanwhile
he
would
introduce
me
into
company
where
intelligence
and
vivacity
would
combine
to
dispel
my
glooms
as
soon
as
we
separated
my
disquietudes
returned
i
contended
with
them
in
vain
and
finally
resolved
to
abandon
my
present
situation
when
and
how
this
purpose
was
to
be
effected
i
knew
not
that
was
to
be
the
theme
of
future
deliberation
evening
having
arrived
welbeck
proposed
to
me
to
accompany
me
on
a
visit
to
one
of
his
friends
i
cheerfully
accepted
the
invitation
and
went
with
him
to
your
friend
mr
wortley's
a
numerous
party
was
assembled
chiefly
of
the
female
sex
i
was
introduced
by
welbeck
by
the
title
of
a
young
friend
of
his
notwithstanding
my
embarrassment
i
did
not
fail
to
attend
to
what
passed
on
this
occasion
i
remarked
that
the
utmost
deference
was
paid
to
my
companion
on
whom
his
entrance
into
this
company
appeared
to
operate
like
magic
his
eyes
sparkled
his
features
expanded
into
a
benign
serenity
and
his
wonted
reserve
gave
place
to
a
torrent-like
and
overflowing
elocution
i
marked
this
change
in
his
deportment
with
the
utmost
astonishment
so
great
was
it
that
i
could
hardly
persuade
myself
that
it
was
the
same
person
a
mind
thus
susceptible
of
new
impressions
must
be
i
conceived
of
a
wonderful
texture
nothing
was
further
from
my
expectations
than
that
this
vivacity
was
mere
dissimulation
and
would
take
its
leave
of
him
when
he
left
the
company
yet
this
i
found
to
be
the
case
the
door
was
no
sooner
closed
after
him
than
his
accustomed
solemnity
returned
he
spake
little
and
that
little
was
delivered
with
emphatical
and
monosyllabic
brevity
we
returned
home
at
a
late
hour
and
i
immediately
retired
to
my
chamber
not
so
much
from
the
desire
of
repose
as
in
order
to
enjoy
and
pursue
my
own
reflections
without
interruption
the
condition
of
my
mind
was
considerably
remote
from
happiness
i
was
placed
in
a
scene
that
furnished
fuel
to
my
curiosity
this
passion
is
a
source
of
pleasure
provided
its
gratification
be
practicable
i
had
no
reason
in
my
present
circumstances
to
despair
of
knowledge
yet
suspicion
and
anxiety
beset
me
i
thought
upon
the
delay
and
toil
which
the
removal
of
my
ignorance
would
cost
and
reaped
only
pain
and
fear
from
the
reflection
the
air
was
remarkably
sultry
lifted
sashes
and
lofty
ceilings
were
insufficient
to
attemper
it
the
perturbation
of
my
thoughts
affected
my
body
and
the
heat
which
oppressed
me
was
aggravated
by
my
restlessness
almost
into
fever
some
hours
were
thus
painfully
past
when
i
recollected
that
the
bath
erected
in
the
court
below
contained
a
sufficient
antidote
to
the
scorching
influence
of
the
atmosphere
i
rose
and
descended
the
stairs
softly
that
i
might
not
alarm
welbeck
and
the
lady
who
occupied
the
two
rooms
on
the
second
floor
i
proceeded
to
the
bath
and
filling
the
reservoir
with
water
speedily
dissipated
the
heat
that
incommoded
me
of
all
species
of
sensual
gratification
that
was
the
most
delicious
and
i
continued
for
a
long
time
laving
my
limbs
and
moistening
my
hair
in
the
midst
of
this
amusement
i
noticed
the
approach
of
day
and
immediately
saw
the
propriety
of
returning
to
my
chamber
i
returned
with
the
same
caution
which
i
had
used
in
descending
my
feet
were
bare
so
that
it
was
easy
to
proceed
unattended
by
the
smallest
signal
of
my
progress
i
had
reached
the
carpeted
staircase
and
was
slowly
ascending
when
i
heard
within
the
chamber
that
was
occupied
by
the
lady
a
noise
as
of
some
one
moving
though
not
conscious
of
having
acted
improperly
yet
i
felt
reluctance
to
be
seen
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
this
sound
was
connected
with
the
detection
of
me
in
this
situation
yet
i
acted
as
if
this
reason
existed
and
made
haste
to
pass
the
door
and
gain
the
second
flight
of
steps
i
was
unable
to
accomplish
my
design
when
the
chamber
door
slowly
opened
and
welbeck
with
a
light
in
his
hand
came
out
i
was
abashed
and
disconcerted
at
this
interview
he
started
at
seeing
me
but
discovering
in
an
instant
who
it
was
his
face
assumed
an
expression
in
which
shame
and
anger
were
powerfully
blended
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
opening
his
mouth
to
rebuke
me
but
suddenly
checking
himself
he
said
in
a
tone
of
mildness
how
is
this
whence
come
you
his
emotion
seemed
to
communicate
itself
with
an
electrical
rapidity
to
my
heart
my
tongue
faltered
while
i
made
some
answer
i
said
i
had
been
seeking
relief
from
the
heat
of
the
weather
in
the
bath
he
heard
my
explanation
in
silence
and
after
a
moment's
pause
passed
into
his
own
room
and
shut
himself
in
i
hastened
to
my
chamber
a
different
observer
might
have
found
in
these
circumstances
no
food
for
his
suspicion
or
his
wonder
to
me
however
they
suggested
vague
and
tumultuous
ideas
as
i
strode
across
the
room
i
repeated
this
woman
is
his
daughter
what
proof
have
i
of
that
he
once
asserted
it
and
has
frequently
uttered
allusions
and
hints
from
which
no
other
inference
could
be
drawn
the
chamber
from
which
he
came
in
an
hour
devoted
to
sleep
was
hers
for
what
end
could
a
visit
like
this
be
paid
a
parent
may
visit
his
child
at
all
seasons
without
a
crime
on
seeing
me
methought
his
features
indicated
more
than
surprise
a
keen
interpreter
would
be
apt
to
suspect
a
consciousness
of
wrong
what
if
this
woman
be
not
his
child
how
shall
their
relationship
be
ascertained
i
was
summoned
at
the
customary
hour
to
breakfast
my
mind
was
full
of
ideas
connected
with
this
incident
i
was
not
endowed
with
sufficient
firmness
to
propose
the
cool
and
systematic
observation
of
this
man's
deportment
i
felt
as
if
the
state
of
my
mind
could
not
but
be
evident
to
him
and
experienced
in
myself
all
the
confusion
which
this
discovery
was
calculated
to
produce
in
him
i
would
have
willingly
excused
myself
from
meeting
him
but
that
was
impossible
at
breakfast
after
the
usual
salutations
nothing
was
said
for
a
time
i
scarcely
lifted
my
eyes
from
the
table
stealing
a
glance
at
welbeck
i
discovered
in
his
features
nothing
but
his
wonted
gravity
he
appeared
occupied
with
thoughts
that
had
no
relation
to
last
night's
adventure
this
encouraged
me
and
i
gradually
recovered
my
composure
their
inattention
to
me
allowed
me
occasionally
to
throw
scrutinizing
and
comparing
glances
at
the
face
of
each
the
relationship
of
parent
and
child
is
commonly
discovered
in
the
visage
but
the
child
may
resemble
either
of
its
parents
yet
have
no
feature
in
common
with
both
here
outlines
surfaces
and
hues
were
in
absolute
contrariety
that
kindred
subsisted
between
them
was
possible
notwithstanding
this
dissimilitude
but
this
circumstance
contributed
to
envenom
my
suspicions
breakfast
being
finished
welbeck
cast
an
eye
of
invitation
to
the
piano-forte
the
lady
rose
to
comply
with
his
request
my
eye
chanced
to
be
at
that
moment
fixed
on
her
in
stepping
to
the
instrument
some
motion
or
appearance
awakened
a
thought
in
my
mind
which
affected
my
feelings
like
the
shock
of
an
earthquake
i
have
too
slight
acquaintance
with
the
history
of
the
passions
to
truly
explain
the
emotion
which
now
throbbed
in
my
veins
i
had
been
a
stranger
to
what
is
called
love
from
subsequent
reflection
i
have
contracted
a
suspicion
that
the
sentiment
with
which
i
regarded
this
lady
was
not
untinctured
from
this
source
and
that
hence
arose
the
turbulence
of
my
feelings
on
observing
what
i
construed
into
marks
of
pregnancy
the
evidence
afforded
me
was
slight
yet
it
exercised
an
absolute
sway
over
my
belief
it
was
well
that
this
suspicion
had
not
been
sooner
excited
now
civility
did
not
require
my
stay
in
the
apartment
and
nothing
but
flight
could
conceal
the
state
of
my
mind
i
hastened
therefore
to
a
distance
and
shrouded
myself
in
the
friendly
secrecy
of
my
own
chamber
the
constitution
of
my
mind
is
doubtless
singular
and
perverse
yet
that
opinion
perhaps
is
the
fruit
of
my
ignorance
it
may
by
no
means
be
uncommon
for
men
to
fashion
their
conclusions
in
opposition
to
evidence
and
probability
and
so
as
to
feed
their
malice
and
subvert
their
happiness
thus
it
was
in
an
eminent
degree
in
my
case
the
simple
fact
was
connected
in
my
mind
with
a
train
of
the
most
hateful
consequences
the
depravity
of
welbeck
was
inferred
from
it
the
charms
of
this
angelic
woman
were
tarnished
and
withered
i
had
formerly
surveyed
her
as
a
precious
and
perfect
monument
but
now
it
was
a
scene
of
ruin
and
blast
this
had
been
a
source
of
sufficient
anguish
but
this
was
not
all
i
recollected
that
the
claims
of
a
parent
had
been
urged
will
you
believe
that
these
claims
were
now
admitted
and
that
they
heightened
the
iniquity
of
welbeck
into
the
blackest
and
most
stupendous
of
all
crimes
these
ideas
were
necessarily
transient
conclusions
more
conformable
to
appearances
succeeded
this
lady
might
have
been
lately
reduced
to
widowhood
the
recent
loss
of
a
beloved
companion
would
sufficiently
account
for
her
dejection
and
make
her
present
situation
compatible
with
duty
by
this
new
train
of
ideas
i
was
somewhat
comforted
i
saw
the
folly
of
precipitate
inferences
and
the
injustice
of
my
atrocious
imputations
and
acquired
some
degree
of
patience
in
my
present
state
of
uncertainty
my
heart
was
lightened
of
its
wonted
burden
and
i
laboured
to
invent
some
harmless
explication
of
the
scene
that
i
had
witnessed
the
preceding
night
at
dinner
welbeck
appeared
as
usual
but
not
the
lady
i
ascribed
her
absence
to
some
casual
indisposition
and
ventured
to
inquire
into
the
state
of
her
health
my
companion
said
she
was
well
but
that
she
had
left
the
city
for
a
month
or
two
finding
the
heat
of
summer
inconvenient
where
she
was
this
was
no
unplausible
reason
for
retirement
a
candid
mind
would
have
acquiesced
in
this
representation
and
found
in
it
nothing
inconsistent
with
a
supposition
respecting
the
cause
of
appearances
favourable
to
her
character
but
otherwise
was
i
affected
the
uneasiness
which
had
flown
for
a
moment
returned
and
i
sunk
into
gloomy
silence
from
this
i
was
roused
by
my
patron
who
requested
me
to
deliver
a
billet
which
he
put
into
my
hand
at
the
counting-house
of
mr
thetford
and
to
bring
him
an
answer
this
message
was
speedily
performed
i
entered
a
large
building
by
the
river-side
a
spacious
apartment
presented
itself
well
furnished
with
pipes
and
hogsheads
in
one
corner
was
a
smaller
room
in
which
a
gentleman
was
busy
at
writing
i
advanced
to
the
door
of
the
room
but
was
there
met
by
a
young
person
who
received
my
paper
and
delivered
it
to
him
within
i
stood
still
at
the
door
but
was
near
enough
to
overhear
what
would
pass
between
them
the
letter
was
laid
upon
the
desk
and
presently
he
that
sat
at
it
lifted
his
eyes
and
glanced
at
the
superscription
he
scarcely
spoke
above
a
whisper
but
his
words
nevertheless
were
clearly
distinguishable
i
did
not
call
to
mind
the
sound
of
his
voice
but
his
words
called
up
a
train
of
recollections
lo
said
he
carelessly
this
from
the
nabob
an
incident
so
slight
as
this
was
sufficient
to
open
a
spacious
scene
of
meditation
this
little
word
half
whispered
in
a
thoughtless
mood
was
a
key
to
unlock
an
extensive
cabinet
of
secrets
thetford
was
probably
indifferent
whether
his
exclamation
were
overheard
little
did
he
think
on
the
inferences
which
would
be
built
upon
it
the
nabob
by
this
appellation
had
some
one
been
denoted
in
the
chamber
dialogue
of
which
i
had
been
an
unsuspected
auditor
the
man
who
pretended
poverty
and
yet
gave
proofs
of
inordinate
wealth
whom
it
was
pardonable
to
defraud
of
thirty
thousand
dollars
first
because
the
loss
of
that
sum
would
be
trivial
to
one
opulent
as
he
and
secondly
because
he
was
imagined
to
have
acquired
this
opulence
by
other
than
honest
methods
instead
of
forthwith
returning
home
i
wandered
into
the
fields
to
indulge
myself
in
the
new
thoughts
which
were
produced
by
this
occurrence
i
entertained
no
doubt
that
the
person
alluded
to
was
my
patron
no
new
light
was
thrown
upon
his
character
unless
something
were
deducible
from
the
charge
vaguely
made
that
his
wealth
was
the
fruit
of
illicit
practices
he
was
opulent
and
the
sources
of
his
wealth
were
unknown
if
not
to
the
rest
of
the
community
at
least
to
thetford
but
here
had
a
plot
been
laid
the
fortune
of
thetford's
brother
was
to
rise
from
the
success
of
artifices
of
which
the
credulity
of
welbeck
was
to
be
the
victim
to
detect
and
to
counterwork
this
plot
was
obviously
my
duty
my
interference
might
now
indeed
be
too
late
to
be
useful
but
this
was
at
least
to
be
ascertained
by
experiment
how
should
my
intention
be
effected
i
had
hitherto
concealed
from
welbeck
my
adventures
at
thetford's
house
these
it
was
now
necessary
to
disclose
and
to
mention
the
recent
occurrence
my
deductions
in
consequence
of
my
ignorance
might
be
erroneous
but
of
their
truth
his
knowledge
of
his
own
affairs
would
enable
him
to
judge
it
was
possible
that
thetford
and
he
whose
chamber
conversation
i
had
overheard
were
different
persons
i
endeavoured
in
vain
to
ascertain
their
identity
by
a
comparison
of
their
voices
the
words
lately
heard
my
remembrance
did
not
enable
me
certainly
to
pronounce
to
be
uttered
by
the
same
organs
this
uncertainty
was
of
little
moment
it
sufficed
that
welbeck
was
designated
by
this
appellation
and
that
therefore
he
was
proved
to
be
the
subject
of
some
fraudulent
proceeding
the
information
that
i
possessed
it
was
my
duty
to
communicate
as
expeditiously
as
possible
i
was
resolved
to
employ
the
first
opportunity
that
offered
for
this
end
my
meditations
had
been
ardently
pursued
and
when
i
recalled
my
attention
i
found
myself
bewildered
among
fields
and
fences
it
was
late
before
i
extricated
myself
from
unknown
paths
and
reached
home
i
entered
the
parlour
but
welbeck
was
not
there
a
table
with
tea-equipage
for
one
person
was
set
from
which
i
inferred
that
welbeck
was
engaged
abroad
this
belief
was
confirmed
by
the
report
of
the
servant
he
could
not
inform
me
where
his
master
was
but
merely
that
he
should
not
take
tea
at
home
this
incident
was
a
source
of
vexation
and
impatience
i
knew
not
but
that
delay
would
be
of
the
utmost
moment
to
the
safety
of
my
friend
wholly
unacquainted
as
i
was
with
the
nature
of
his
contracts
with
thetford
i
could
not
decide
whether
a
single
hour
would
not
avail
to
obviate
the
evils
that
threatened
him
had
i
known
whither
to
trace
his
footsteps
i
should
certainly
have
sought
an
immediate
interview
but
as
it
was
i
was
obliged
to
wait
with
what
patience
i
could
collect
for
his
return
to
his
own
house
i
waited
hour
after
hour
in
vain
the
sun
declined
and
the
shades
of
evening
descended
but
welbeck
was
still
at
a
distance
welbeck
did
not
return
though
hour
succeeded
hour
till
the
clock
struck
ten
i
inquired
of
the
servants
who
informed
me
that
their
master
was
not
accustomed
to
stay
out
so
late
i
seated
myself
at
a
table
in
a
parlour
on
which
there
stood
a
light
and
listened
for
the
signal
of
his
coming
either
by
the
sound
of
steps
on
the
pavement
without
or
by
a
peal
from
the
bell
the
silence
was
uninterrupted
and
profound
and
each
minute
added
to
my
sum
of
impatience
and
anxiety
to
relieve
myself
from
the
heat
of
the
weather
which
was
aggravated
by
the
condition
of
my
thoughts
as
well
as
to
beguile
this
tormenting
interval
it
occurred
to
me
to
betake
myself
to
the
bath
i
left
the
candle
where
it
stood
and
imagined
that
even
in
the
bath
i
should
hear
the
sound
of
the
bell
which
would
be
rung
upon
his
arrival
at
the
door
no
such
signal
occurred
and
after
taking
this
refreshment
i
prepared
to
return
to
my
post
the
parlour
was
still
unoccupied
but
this
was
not
all
the
candle
i
had
left
upon
the
table
was
gone
this
was
an
inexplicable
circumstance
on
my
promise
to
wait
for
their
master
the
servants
had
retired
to
bed
no
signal
of
any
one's
entrance
had
been
given
the
street
door
was
locked
and
the
key
hung
at
its
customary
place
upon
the
wall
what
was
i
to
think
it
was
obvious
to
suppose
that
the
candle
had
been
removed
by
a
domestic
but
their
footsteps
could
not
be
traced
and
i
was
not
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
house
to
find
the
way
especially
immersed
in
darkness
to
their
chamber
one
measure
however
it
was
evidently
proper
to
take
which
was
to
supply
myself
anew
with
a
light
this
was
instantly
performed
but
what
was
next
to
be
done
i
was
weary
of
the
perplexities
in
which
i
was
embroiled
i
saw
no
avenue
to
escape
from
them
but
that
which
led
me
to
the
bosom
of
nature
and
to
my
ancient
occupations
for
a
moment
i
was
tempted
to
resume
my
rustic
garb
and
on
that
very
hour
to
desert
this
habitation
one
thing
only
detained
me
the
desire
to
apprize
my
patron
of
the
treachery
of
thetford
for
this
end
i
was
anxious
to
obtain
an
interview
but
now
i
reflected
that
this
information
could
by
other
means
be
imparted
was
it
not
sufficient
to
write
him
briefly
these
particulars
and
leave
him
to
profit
by
the
knowledge
thus
i
might
likewise
acquaint
him
with
my
motives
for
thus
abruptly
and
unseasonably
deserting
his
service
to
the
execution
of
this
scheme
pen
and
paper
were
necessary
the
business
of
writing
was
performed
in
the
chamber
on
the
third
story
i
had
been
hitherto
denied
access
to
this
room
in
it
was
a
show
of
papers
and
books
here
it
was
that
the
task
for
which
i
had
been
retained
was
to
be
performed
but
i
was
to
enter
it
and
leave
it
only
in
company
with
welbeck
for
what
reasons
i
asked
was
this
procedure
to
be
adopted
the
influence
of
prohibitions
and
an
appearance
of
disguise
in
awakening
curiosity
is
well
known
my
mind
fastened
upon
the
idea
of
this
room
with
an
unusual
degree
of
intenseness
i
had
seen
it
but
for
a
moment
many
of
welbeck's
hours
were
spent
in
it
it
was
not
to
be
inferred
that
they
were
consumed
in
idleness
what
then
was
the
nature
of
his
employment
over
which
a
veil
of
such
impenetrable
secrecy
was
cast
will
you
wonder
that
the
design
of
entering
this
recess
was
insensibly
formed
possibly
it
was
locked
but
its
accessibleness
was
likewise
possible
i
meant
not
the
commission
of
any
crime
my
principal
purpose
was
to
procure
the
implements
of
writing
which
were
elsewhere
not
to
be
found
i
should
neither
unseal
papers
nor
open
drawers
i
would
merely
take
a
survey
of
the
volumes
and
attend
to
the
objects
that
spontaneously
presented
themselves
to
my
view
in
this
there
surely
was
nothing
criminal
or
blameworthy
meanwhile
i
was
not
unmindful
of
the
sudden
disappearance
of
the
candle
this
incident
filled
my
bosom
with
the
inquietudes
of
fear
and
the
perturbations
of
wonder
once
more
i
paused
to
catch
any
sound
that
might
arise
from
without
all
was
still
i
seized
the
candle
and
prepared
to
mount
the
stairs
i
had
not
reached
the
first
landing
when
i
called
to
mind
my
midnight
meeting
with
welbeck
at
the
door
of
his
daughter's
chamber
the
chamber
was
now
desolate
perhaps
it
was
accessible
if
so
no
injury
was
done
by
entering
it
my
curiosity
was
strong
but
it
pictured
to
itself
no
precise
object
three
steps
would
bear
me
to
the
door
the
trial
whether
it
was
fastened
might
be
made
in
a
moment
and
i
readily
imagined
that
something
might
be
found
within
to
reward
the
trouble
of
examination
the
door
yielded
to
my
hand
and
i
entered
no
remarkable
object
was
discoverable
the
apartment
was
supplied
with
the
usual
furniture
i
bent
my
steps
towards
a
table
over
which
a
mirror
was
suspended
my
glances
which
roved
with
swiftness
from
one
object
to
another
shortly
lighted
on
a
miniature
portrait
that
hung
near
i
scrutinized
it
with
eagerness
it
was
impossible
to
overlook
its
resemblance
to
my
own
visage
this
was
so
great
that
for
a
moment
i
imagined
myself
to
have
been
the
original
from
which
it
had
been
drawn
this
flattering
conception
yielded
place
to
a
belief
merely
of
similitude
between
me
and
the
genuine
original
the
thoughts
which
this
opinion
was
fitted
to
produce
were
suspended
by
a
new
object
a
small
volume
that
had
apparently
been
much
used
lay
upon
the
toilet
i
opened
it
and
found
it
to
contain
some
of
the
dramas
of
apostolo
zeno
i
turned
over
the
leaves
a
written
paper
saluted
my
sight
a
single
glance
informed
me
that
it
was
english
for
the
present
i
was
insensible
to
all
motives
that
would
command
me
to
forbear
i
seized
the
paper
with
an
intention
to
peruse
it
at
that
moment
a
stunning
report
was
heard
it
was
loud
enough
to
shake
the
walls
of
the
apartment
and
abrupt
enough
to
throw
me
into
tremors
i
dropped
the
book
and
yielded
for
a
moment
to
confusion
and
surprise
from
what
quarter
it
came
i
was
unable
accurately
to
determine
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
from
its
loudness
that
it
was
near
and
even
in
the
house
it
was
no
less
manifest
that
the
sound
arose
from
the
discharge
of
a
pistol
some
hand
must
have
drawn
the
trigger
i
recollected
the
disappearance
of
the
candle
from
the
room
below
instantly
a
supposition
darted
into
my
mind
which
made
my
hair
rise
and
my
teeth
chatter
this
i
said
is
the
deed
of
welbeck
he
entered
while
i
was
absent
from
the
room
he
hied
to
his
chamber
and
prompted
by
some
unknown
instigation
has
inflicted
on
himself
death
this
idea
had
a
tendency
to
palsy
my
limbs
and
my
thoughts
some
time
passed
in
painful
and
tumultuous
fluctuation
my
aversion
to
this
catastrophe
rather
than
a
belief
of
being
by
that
means
able
to
prevent
or
repair
the
evil
induced
me
to
attempt
to
enter
his
chamber
it
was
possible
that
my
conjectures
were
erroneous
the
door
of
his
room
was
locked
i
knocked
i
demanded
entrance
in
a
low
voice
i
put
my
eye
and
my
ear
to
the
keyhole
and
the
crevices
nothing
could
be
heard
or
seen
it
was
unavoidable
to
conclude
that
no
one
was
within
yet
the
effluvia
of
gunpowder
was
perceptible
perhaps
the
room
above
had
been
the
scene
of
this
catastrophe
i
ascended
the
second
flight
of
stairs
i
approached
the
door
no
sound
could
be
caught
by
my
most
vigilant
attention
i
put
out
the
light
that
i
carried
and
was
then
able
to
perceive
that
there
was
light
within
the
room
i
scarcely
knew
how
to
act
for
some
minutes
i
paused
at
the
door
i
spoke
and
requested
permission
to
enter
my
words
were
succeeded
by
a
death-like
stillness
at
length
i
ventured
softly
to
withdraw
the
bolt
to
open
and
to
advance
within
the
room
nothing
could
exceed
the
horror
of
my
expectation
yet
i
was
startled
by
the
scene
that
i
beheld
in
a
chair
whose
back
was
placed
against
the
front
wall
sat
welbeck
my
entrance
alarmed
him
not
nor
roused
him
from
the
stupor
into
which
he
was
plunged
he
rested
his
hands
upon
his
knees
and
his
eyes
were
riveted
to
something
that
lay
at
the
distance
of
a
few
feet
before
him
on
the
floor
a
second
glance
was
sufficient
to
inform
me
of
what
nature
this
object
was
it
was
the
body
of
a
man
bleeding
ghastly
and
still
exhibiting
the
marks
of
convulsion
and
agony
i
shall
omit
to
describe
the
shock
which
a
spectacle
like
this
communicated
to
my
unpractised
senses
i
was
nearly
as
panic-struck
and
powerless
as
welbeck
himself
i
gazed
without
power
of
speech
at
one
time
at
welbeck
then
i
fixed
terrified
eyes
on
the
distorted
features
of
the
dead
at
length
welbeck
recovering
from
his
reverie
looked
up
as
if
to
see
who
it
was
that
had
entered
no
surprise
no
alarm
was
betrayed
by
him
on
seeing
me
he
manifested
no
desire
or
intention
to
interrupt
the
fearful
silence
my
thoughts
wandered
in
confusion
and
terror
the
first
impulse
was
to
fly
from
the
scene
but
i
could
not
be
long
insensible
to
the
exigences
of
the
moment
i
saw
that
affairs
must
not
be
suffered
to
remain
in
their
present
situation
the
insensibility
or
despair
of
welbeck
required
consolation
and
succour
how
to
communicate
my
thoughts
or
offer
my
assistance
i
knew
not
what
led
to
this
murderous
catastrophe
who
it
was
whose
breathless
corpse
was
before
me
what
concern
welbeck
had
in
producing
his
death
were
as
yet
unknown
at
length
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
strode
at
first
with
faltering
and
then
with
more
steadfast
steps
across
the
floor
this
motion
seemed
to
put
him
in
possession
of
himself
he
seemed
now
for
the
first
time
to
recognise
my
presence
he
turned
to
me
and
said
in
a
tone
of
severity--
how
now
what
brings
you
here
this
rebuke
was
unexpected
i
stammered
out
in
reply
that
the
report
of
the
pistol
had
alarmed
me
and
that
i
came
to
discover
the
cause
of
it
he
noticed
not
my
answer
but
resumed
his
perturbed
steps
and
his
anxious
but
abstracted
looks
suddenly
he
checked
himself
and
glancing
a
furious
eye
at
the
corpse
he
muttered
yes
the
die
is
cast
this
worthless
and
miserable
scene
shall
last
no
longer
i
will
at
once
get
rid
of
life
and
all
its
humiliations
here
succeeded
a
new
pause
the
course
of
his
thoughts
seemed
now
to
become
once
more
tranquil
sadness
rather
than
fury
overspread
his
features
and
his
accent
when
he
spoke
to
me
was
not
faltering
but
solemn
mervyn
said
he
you
comprehend
not
this
scene
your
youth
and
inexperience
make
you
a
stranger
to
a
deceitful
and
flagitious
world
you
know
me
not
it
is
time
that
this
ignorance
should
vanish
the
knowledge
of
me
and
of
my
actions
may
be
of
use
to
you
it
may
teach
you
to
avoid
the
shoals
on
which
my
virtue
and
my
peace
have
been
wrecked
but
to
the
rest
of
mankind
it
can
be
of
no
use
the
ruin
of
my
fame
is
perhaps
irretrievable
but
the
height
of
my
iniquity
need
not
be
known
i
perceive
in
you
a
rectitude
and
firmness
worthy
to
be
trusted
promise
me
therefore
that
not
a
syllable
of
what
i
tell
you
shall
ever
pass
your
lips
i
had
lately
experienced
the
inconvenience
of
a
promise
but
i
was
now
confused
embarrassed
ardently
inquisitive
as
to
the
nature
of
this
scene
and
unapprized
of
the
motives
that
might
afterwards
occur
persuading
or
compelling
me
to
disclosure
the
promise
which
he
exacted
was
given
he
resumed--
i
have
detained
you
in
my
service
partly
for
your
own
benefit
but
chiefly
for
mine
i
intended
to
inflict
upon
you
injury
and
to
do
you
good
neither
of
these
ends
can
i
now
accomplish
unless
the
lessons
which
my
example
may
inculcate
shall
inspire
you
with
fortitude
and
arm
you
with
caution
what
it
was
that
made
me
thus
i
know
not
i
am
not
destitute
of
understanding
my
thirst
of
knowledge
though
irregular
is
ardent
i
can
talk
and
can
feel
as
virtue
and
justice
prescribe
yet
the
tenor
of
my
actions
has
been
uniform
one
tissue
of
iniquity
and
folly
has
been
my
life
while
my
thoughts
have
been
familiar
with
enlightened
and
disinterested
principles
scorn
and
detestation
i
have
heaped
upon
myself
yesterday
is
remembered
with
remorse
to-morrow
is
contemplated
with
anguish
and
fear
yet
every
day
is
productive
of
the
same
crimes
and
of
the
same
follies
i
was
left
by
the
insolvency
of
my
father
a
trader
of
liverpool
without
any
means
of
support
but
such
as
labour
should
afford
me
whatever
could
generate
pride
and
the
love
of
independence
was
my
portion
whatever
can
incite
to
diligence
was
the
growth
of
my
condition
yet
my
indolence
was
a
cureless
disease
and
there
were
no
arts
too
sordid
for
me
to
practise
i
was
content
to
live
on
the
bounty
of
a
kinsman
his
family
was
numerous
and
his
revenue
small
he
forbore
to
upbraid
me
or
even
to
insinuate
the
propriety
of
providing
for
myself
but
he
empowered
me
to
pursue
any
liberal
or
mechanical
profession
which
might
suit
my
taste
i
was
insensible
to
every
generous
motive
i
laboured
to
forget
my
dependent
and
disgraceful
condition
because
the
remembrance
was
a
source
of
anguish
without
being
able
to
inspire
me
with
a
steady
resolution
to
change
it
i
contracted
an
acquaintance
with
a
woman
who
was
unchaste
perverse
and
malignant
me
however
she
found
it
no
difficult
task
to
deceive
my
uncle
remonstrated
against
the
union
he
took
infinite
pains
to
unveil
my
error
and
to
convince
me
that
wedlock
was
improper
for
one
destitute
as
i
was
of
the
means
of
support
even
if
the
object
of
my
choice
were
personally
unexceptionable
his
representations
were
listened
to
with
anger
that
he
thwarted
my
will
in
this
respect
even
by
affectionate
expostulation
cancelled
all
that
debt
of
gratitude
which
i
owed
to
him
i
rewarded
him
for
all
his
kindness
by
invective
and
disdain
and
hastened
to
complete
my
ill-omened
marriage
i
had
deceived
the
woman's
father
by
assertions
of
possessing
secret
resources
to
gratify
my
passion
i
descended
to
dissimulation
and
falsehood
he
admitted
me
into
his
family
as
the
husband
of
his
child
but
the
character
of
my
wife
and
the
fallacy
of
my
assertions
were
quickly
discovered
he
denied
me
accommodation
under
his
roof
and
i
was
turned
forth
to
the
world
to
endure
the
penalty
of
my
rashness
and
my
indolence
temptation
would
have
moulded
me
into
any
villanous
shape
my
virtuous
theories
and
comprehensive
erudition
would
not
have
saved
me
from
the
basest
of
crimes
luckily
for
me
i
was
for
the
present
exempted
from
temptation
i
had
formed
an
acquaintance
with
a
young
american
captain
on
being
partially
informed
of
my
situation
he
invited
me
to
embark
with
him
for
his
own
country
my
passage
was
gratuitous
i
arrived
in
a
short
time
at
charleston
which
was
the
place
of
his
abode
he
introduced
me
to
his
family
every
member
of
which
was
like
himself
imbued
with
affection
and
benevolence
i
was
treated
like
their
son
and
brother
i
was
hospitably
entertained
until
i
should
be
able
to
select
some
path
of
lucrative
industry
such
was
my
incurable
depravity
that
i
made
no
haste
to
select
my
pursuit
an
interval
of
inoccupation
succeeded
which
i
applied
to
the
worst
purposes
my
friend
had
a
sister
who
was
married
but
during
the
absence
of
her
husband
resided
with
her
family
hence
originated
our
acquaintance
the
purest
of
human
hearts
and
the
most
vigorous
understanding
were
hers
she
idolized
her
husband
who
well
deserved
to
be
the
object
of
her
adoration
her
affection
for
him
and
her
general
principles
appeared
to
be
confirmed
beyond
the
power
to
be
shaken
i
sought
her
intercourse
without
illicit
views
i
delighted
in
the
effusions
of
her
candour
and
the
flashes
of
her
intelligence
i
conformed
by
a
kind
of
instinctive
hypocrisy
to
her
views
i
spoke
and
felt
from
the
influence
of
immediate
and
momentary
conviction
she
imagined
she
had
found
in
me
a
friend
worthy
to
partake
in
all
her
sympathies
and
forward
all
her
wishes
we
were
mutually
deceived
she
was
the
victim
of
self-delusion
but
i
must
charge
myself
with
practising
deceit
both
upon
myself
and
her
i
reflect
with
astonishment
and
horror
on
the
steps
which
led
to
her
degradation
and
to
my
calamity
in
the
high
career
of
passion
all
consequences
were
overlooked
she
was
the
dupe
of
the
most
audacious
sophistry
and
the
grossest
delusion
i
was
the
slave
of
sensual
impulses
and
voluntary
blindness
the
effect
may
be
easily
conceived
not
till
symptoms
of
pregnancy
began
to
appear
were
our
eyes
opened
to
the
ruin
which
impended
over
us
then
i
began
to
revolve
the
consequences
which
the
mist
of
passion
had
hitherto
concealed
i
was
tormented
by
the
pangs
of
remorse
and
pursued
by
the
phantom
of
ingratitude
to
complete
my
despair
this
unfortunate
lady
was
apprized
of
my
marriage
with
another
woman
a
circumstance
which
i
had
anxiously
concealed
from
her
she
fled
from
her
father's
house
at
a
time
when
her
husband
and
brother
were
hourly
expected
what
became
of
her
i
knew
not
she
left
behind
her
a
letter
to
her
father
in
which
the
melancholy
truth
was
told
shame
and
remorse
had
no
power
over
my
life
to
elude
the
storm
of
invective
and
upbraiding
to
quiet
the
uproar
of
my
mind
i
did
not
betake
myself
to
voluntary
death
my
pusillanimity
still
clung
to
this
wretched
existence
i
abruptly
retired
from
the
scene
and
repairing
to
the
port
embarked
in
the
first
vessel
which
appeared
the
ship
chanced
to
belong
to
wilmington
in
delaware
and
here
i
sought
out
an
obscure
and
cheap
abode
i
possessed
no
means
of
subsistence
i
was
unknown
to
my
neighbours
and
desired
to
remain
unknown
i
was
unqualified
for
manual
labour
by
all
the
habits
of
my
life
but
there
was
no
choice
between
penury
and
diligence--between
honest
labour
and
criminal
inactivity
i
mused
incessantly
on
the
forlornness
of
my
condition
hour
after
hour
passed
and
the
horrors
of
want
began
to
encompass
me
i
sought
with
eagerness
for
an
avenue
by
which
i
might
escape
from
it
the
perverseness
of
my
nature
led
me
on
from
one
guilty
thought
to
another
i
took
refuge
in
my
customary
sophistries
and
reconciled
myself
at
length
to
a
scheme
of--forgery
having
ascertained
my
purpose
it
was
requisite
to
search
out
the
means
by
which
i
might
effect
it
these
were
not
clearly
or
readily
suggested
the
more
i
contemplated
my
project
the
more
numerous
and
arduous
its
difficulties
appeared
i
had
no
associates
in
my
undertaking
a
due
regard
to
my
safety
and
the
unextinguished
sense
of
honour
deterred
me
from
seeking
auxiliaries
and
co-agents
the
esteem
of
mankind
was
the
spring
of
all
my
activity
the
parent
of
all
my
virtue
and
all
my
vice
to
preserve
this
it
was
necessary
that
my
guilty
projects
should
have
neither
witness
nor
partaker
i
quickly
discovered
that
to
execute
this
scheme
demanded
time
application
and
money
none
of
which
my
present
situation
would
permit
me
to
devote
to
it
at
first
it
appeared
that
an
attainable
degree
of
skill
and
circumspection
would
enable
me
to
arrive
by
means
of
counterfeit
bills
to
the
pinnacle
of
affluence
and
honour
my
error
was
detected
by
a
closer
scrutiny
and
i
finally
saw
nothing
in
this
path
but
enormous
perils
and
insurmountable
impediments
yet
what
alternative
was
offered
me
to
maintain
myself
by
the
labour
of
my
hands
to
perform
any
toilsome
or
prescribed
task
was
incompatible
with
my
nature
my
habits
debarred
me
from
country
occupations
my
pride
regarded
as
vile
and
ignominious
drudgery
any
employment
which
the
town
could
afford
meanwhile
my
wants
were
as
urgent
as
ever
and
my
funds
were
exhausted
there
are
few
perhaps
whose
external
situation
resembled
mine
who
would
have
found
in
it
any
thing
but
incitements
to
industry
and
invention
a
thousand
methods
of
subsistence
honest
but
laborious
were
at
my
command
but
to
these
i
entertained
an
irreconcilable
aversion
ease
and
the
respect
attendant
upon
opulence
i
was
willing
to
purchase
at
the
price
of
ever-wakeful
suspicion
and
eternal
remorse
but
even
at
this
price
the
purchase
was
impossible
the
desperateness
of
my
condition
became
hourly
more
apparent
the
further
i
extended
my
view
the
darker
grew
the
clouds
which
hung
over
futurity
anguish
and
infamy
appeared
to
be
the
inseparable
conditions
of
my
existence
there
was
one
mode
of
evading
the
evils
that
impended
to
free
myself
from
self-upbraiding
and
to
shun
the
persecutions
of
my
fortune
was
possible
only
by
shaking
off
life
itself
one
evening
as
i
traversed
the
bank
of
the
creek
these
dismal
meditations
were
uncommonly
intense
they
at
length
terminated
in
a
resolution
to
throw
myself
into
the
stream
the
first
impulse
was
to
rush
instantly
to
my
death
but
the
remembrance
of
papers
lying
at
my
lodgings
which
might
unfold
more
than
i
desired
to
the
curiosity
of
survivors
induced
me
to
postpone
this
catastrophe
till
the
next
morning
my
purpose
being
formed
i
found
my
heart
lightened
of
its
usual
weight
by
you
it
will
be
thought
strange
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
i
derived
from
this
new
prospect
not
only
tranquillity
but
cheerfulness
i
hastened
home
as
soon
as
i
entered
my
landlord
informed
me
that
a
person
had
been
searching
for
me
in
my
absence
this
was
an
unexampled
incident
and
foreboded
me
no
good
i
was
strongly
persuaded
that
my
visitant
had
been
led
hither
not
by
friendly
but
hostile
purposes
this
persuasion
was
confirmed
by
the
description
of
the
stranger's
guise
and
demeanour
given
by
my
landlord
my
fears
instantly
recognised
the
image
of
watson
the
man
by
whom
i
had
been
so
eminently
benefited
and
whose
kindness
i
had
compensated
by
the
ruin
of
his
sister
and
the
confusion
of
his
family
an
interview
with
this
man
was
less
to
be
endured
than
to
look
upon
the
face
of
an
avenging
deity
i
was
determined
to
avoid
this
interview
and
for
this
end
to
execute
my
fatal
purpose
within
the
hour
my
papers
were
collected
with
a
tremulous
hand
and
consigned
to
the
flames
i
then
bade
my
landlord
inform
all
visitants
that
i
should
not
return
till
the
next
day
and
once
more
hastened
towards
the
river
my
way
led
past
the
inn
where
one
of
the
stages
from
baltimore
was
accustomed
to
stop
i
was
not
unaware
that
watson
had
possibly
been
brought
in
the
coach
which
had
recently
arrived
and
which
now
stood
before
the
door
of
the
inn
the
danger
of
my
being
descried
or
encountered
by
him
as
i
passed
did
not
fail
to
occur
this
was
to
be
eluded
by
deviating
from
the
main
street
scarcely
had
i
turned
a
corner
for
this
purpose
when
i
was
accosted
by
a
young
man
whom
i
knew
to
be
an
inhabitant
of
the
town
but
with
whom
i
had
hitherto
had
no
intercourse
but
what
consisted
in
a
transient
salutation
he
apologized
for
the
liberty
of
addressing
me
and
at
the
same
time
inquired
if
i
understood
the
french
language
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
he
proceeded
to
tell
me
that
in
the
stage
just
arrived
had
come
a
passenger
a
youth
who
appeared
to
be
french
who
was
wholly
unacquainted
with
our
language
and
who
had
been
seized
with
a
violent
disease
my
informant
had
felt
compassion
for
the
forlorn
condition
of
the
stranger
and
had
just
been
seeking
me
at
my
lodgings
in
hope
that
my
knowledge
of
french
would
enable
me
to
converse
with
the
sick
man
and
obtain
from
him
a
knowledge
of
his
situation
and
views
the
apprehensions
i
had
precipitately
formed
were
thus
removed
and
i
readily
consented
to
perform
this
service
the
youth
was
indeed
in
a
deplorable
condition
besides
the
pains
of
his
disease
he
was
overpowered
by
dejection
the
innkeeper
was
extremely
anxious
for
the
removal
of
his
guest
he
was
by
no
means
willing
to
sustain
the
trouble
and
expense
of
a
sick
or
a
dying
man
for
which
it
was
scarcely
probable
that
he
should
ever
be
reimbursed
the
traveller
had
no
baggage
and
his
dress
betokened
the
pressure
of
many
wants
my
compassion
for
this
stranger
was
powerfully
awakened
i
was
in
possession
of
a
suitable
apartment
for
which
i
had
no
power
to
pay
the
rent
that
was
accruing
but
my
inability
in
this
respect
was
unknown
and
i
might
enjoy
my
lodgings
unmolested
for
some
weeks
the
fate
of
this
youth
would
be
speedily
decided
and
i
should
be
left
at
liberty
to
execute
my
first
intentions
before
my
embarrassments
should
be
visibly
increased
after
a
moment's
pause
i
conducted
the
stranger
to
my
home
placed
him
in
my
own
bed
and
became
his
nurse
his
malady
was
such
as
is
known
in
the
tropical
islands
by
the
name
of
the
yellow
or
malignant
fever
and
the
physician
who
was
called
speedily
pronounced
his
case
desperate
it
was
my
duty
to
warn
him
of
the
death
that
was
hastening
and
to
promise
the
fulfilment
of
any
of
his
wishes
not
inconsistent
with
my
present
situation
he
received
my
intelligence
with
fortitude
and
appeared
anxious
to
communicate
some
information
respecting
his
own
state
his
pangs
and
his
weakness
scarcely
allowed
him
to
be
intelligible
from
his
feeble
efforts
and
broken
narrative
i
collected
thus
much
concerning
his
family
and
fortune
his
father's
name
was
vincentio
lodi
from
a
merchant
at
leghorn
he
had
changed
himself
into
a
planter
in
the
island
of
guadaloupe
his
son
had
been
sent
at
an
early
age
for
the
benefits
of
education
to
europe
the
young
vincentio
was
at
length
informed
by
his
father
that
being
weary
of
his
present
mode
of
existence
he
had
determined
to
sell
his
property
and
transport
himself
to
the
united
states
the
son
was
directed
to
hasten
home
that
he
might
embark
with
his
father
on
this
voyage
the
summons
was
cheerfully
obeyed
the
youth
on
his
arrival
at
the
island
found
preparation
making
for
the
funeral
of
his
father
it
appeared
that
the
elder
lodi
had
flattered
one
of
his
slaves
with
the
prospect
of
his
freedom
but
had
nevertheless
included
this
slave
in
the
sale
that
he
had
made
of
his
estate
actuated
by
revenge
the
slave
assassinated
lodi
in
the
open
street
and
resigned
himself
without
a
struggle
to
the
punishment
which
the
law
had
provided
for
such
a
deed
the
property
had
been
recently
transferred
and
the
price
was
now
presented
to
young
vincentio
by
the
purchaser
he
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
adopt
his
father's
project
and
was
impatient
to
return
with
his
inheritance
to
france
before
this
could
be
done
the
conduct
of
his
father
had
rendered
a
voyage
to
the
continent
indispensable
lodi
had
a
daughter
whom
a
few
weeks
previous
to
his
death
he
had
intrusted
to
an
american
captain
for
whom
he
had
contracted
a
friendship
the
vessel
was
bound
to
philadelphia
but
the
conduct
she
was
to
pursue
and
the
abode
she
was
to
select
on
her
arrival
were
known
only
to
the
father
whose
untimely
death
involved
the
son
in
considerable
uncertainty
with
regard
to
his
sister's
fate
his
anxiety
on
this
account
induced
him
to
seize
the
first
conveyance
that
offered
in
a
short
time
he
landed
at
baltimore
as
soon
as
he
recovered
from
the
fatigues
of
his
voyage
he
prepared
to
go
to
philadelphia
thither
his
baggage
was
immediately
sent
under
the
protection
of
a
passenger
and
countryman
his
money
consisted
in
portuguese
gold
which
in
pursuance
of
advice
he
had
changed
into
bank-notes
he
besought
me
in
pathetic
terms
to
search
out
his
sister
whose
youth
and
poverty
and
ignorance
of
the
language
and
manners
of
the
country
might
expose
her
to
innumerable
hardships
at
the
same
time
he
put
a
pocket-book
and
small
volume
into
my
hand
indicating
by
his
countenance
and
gestures
his
desire
that
i
would
deliver
them
to
his
sister
his
obsequies
being
decently
performed
i
had
leisure
to
reflect
upon
the
change
in
my
condition
which
this
incident
had
produced
in
the
pocket-book
were
found
bills
to
the
amount
of
twenty
thousand
dollars
the
volume
proved
to
be
a
manuscript
written
by
the
elder
lodi
in
italian
and
contained
memoirs
of
the
ducal
house
of
visconti
from
whom
the
writer
believed
himself
to
have
lineally
descended
thus
had
i
arrived
by
an
avenue
so
much
beyond
my
foresight
at
the
possession
of
wealth
the
evil
which
impelled
me
to
the
brink
of
suicide
and
which
was
the
source
though
not
of
all
yet
of
the
larger
portion
of
my
anguish
was
now
removed
what
claims
to
honour
or
to
ease
were
consequent
on
riches
were
by
an
extraordinary
fortune
now
conferred
upon
me
such
for
a
time
were
my
new-born
but
transitory
raptures
i
forgot
that
this
money
was
not
mine
that
it
had
been
received
under
every
sanction
of
fidelity
for
another's
use
to
retain
it
was
equivalent
to
robbery
the
sister
of
the
deceased
was
the
rightful
claimant
it
was
my
duty
to
search
her
out
and
perform
my
tacit
but
sacred
obligations
by
putting
the
whole
into
her
possession
this
conclusion
was
too
adverse
to
my
wishes
not
to
be
strenuously
combated
i
asked
what
it
was
that
gave
man
the
power
of
ascertaining
the
successor
to
his
property
during
his
life
he
might
transfer
the
actual
possession
but
if
vacant
at
his
death
he
into
whose
hands
accident
should
cast
it
was
the
genuine
proprietor
it
is
true
that
the
law
had
sometimes
otherwise
decreed
but
in
law
there
was
no
validity
further
than
it
was
able
by
investigation
and
punishment
to
enforce
its
decrees
but
would
the
law
extort
this
money
from
me
it
was
rather
by
gesture
than
by
words
that
the
will
of
lodi
was
imparted
it
was
the
topic
of
remote
inferences
and
vague
conjecture
rather
than
of
explicit
and
unerring
declarations
besides
if
the
lady
were
found
would
not
prudence
dictate
the
reservation
of
her
fortune
to
be
administered
by
me
for
her
benefit
of
this
her
age
and
education
had
disqualified
herself
it
was
sufficient
for
the
maintenance
of
both
she
would
regard
me
as
her
benefactor
and
protector
by
supplying
all
her
wants
and
watching
over
her
safety
without
apprizing
her
of
the
means
by
which
i
shall
be
enabled
to
do
this
i
shall
lay
irresistible
claims
to
her
love
and
her
gratitude
such
were
the
sophistries
by
which
reason
was
seduced
and
my
integrity
annihilated
i
hastened
away
from
my
present
abode
i
easily
traced
the
baggage
of
the
deceased
to
an
inn
and
gained
possession
of
it
it
contained
nothing
but
clothes
and
books
i
then
instituted
the
most
diligent
search
after
the
young
lady
for
a
time
my
exertions
were
fruitless
meanwhile
the
possessor
of
this
house
thought
proper
to
embark
with
his
family
for
europe
the
sum
which
he
demanded
for
his
furniture
though
enormous
was
precipitately
paid
by
me
his
servants
were
continued
in
their
former
stations
and
in
the
day
at
which
he
relinquished
the
mansion
i
entered
on
possession
there
was
no
difficulty
in
persuading
the
world
that
welbeck
was
a
personage
of
opulence
and
rank
my
birth
and
previous
adventures
it
was
proper
to
conceal
the
facility
with
which
mankind
are
misled
in
their
estimate
of
characters
their
proneness
to
multiply
inferences
and
conjectures
will
not
be
readily
conceived
by
one
destitute
of
my
experience
my
sudden
appearance
on
the
stage
my
stately
reserve
my
splendid
habitation
and
my
circumspect
deportment
were
sufficient
to
entitle
me
to
homage
the
artifices
that
were
used
to
unveil
the
truth
and
the
guesses
that
were
current
respecting
me
were
adapted
to
gratify
my
ruling
passion
i
did
not
remit
my
diligence
to
discover
the
retreat
of
mademoiselle
lodi
i
found
her
at
length
in
the
family
of
a
kinsman
of
the
captain
under
whose
care
she
had
come
to
america
her
situation
was
irksome
and
perilous
she
had
already
experienced
the
evils
of
being
protectorless
and
indigent
and
my
seasonable
interference
snatched
her
from
impending
and
less
supportable
ills
i
could
safely
unfold
all
that
i
knew
of
her
brother's
history
except
the
legacy
which
he
had
left
i
ascribed
the
diligence
with
which
i
had
sought
her
to
his
death-bed
injunctions
and
prevailed
upon
her
to
accept
from
me
the
treatment
which
she
would
have
received
from
her
brother
if
he
had
continued
to
live
and
if
his
power
to
benefit
had
been
equal
to
my
own
though
less
can
be
said
in
praise
of
the
understanding
than
of
the
sensibilities
of
this
woman
she
is
one
whom
no
one
could
refrain
from
loving
though
placed
in
situations
far
less
favourable
to
the
generation
of
that
sentiment
than
mine
in
habits
of
domestic
and
incessant
intercourse
in
the
perpetual
contemplation
of
features
animated
by
boundless
gratitude
and
ineffable
sympathies
it
could
not
be
expected
that
either
she
or
i
should
escape
enchantment
the
poison
was
too
sweet
not
to
be
swallowed
with
avidity
by
me
too
late
i
remembered
that
i
was
already
enslaved
by
inextricable
obligations
it
was
easy
to
have
hidden
this
impediment
from
the
eyes
of
my
companion
but
here
my
integrity
refused
to
yield
i
can
indeed
lay
claim
to
little
merit
on
account
of
this
forbearance
if
there
had
been
no
alternative
between
deceit
and
the
frustration
of
my
hopes
i
should
doubtless
have
dissembled
the
truth
with
as
little
scruple
on
this
as
on
a
different
occasion
but
i
could
not
be
blind
to
the
weakness
of
her
with
whom
i
had
to
contend
meanwhile
large
deductions
had
been
made
from
my
stock
of
money
and
the
remnant
would
be
speedily
consumed
by
my
present
mode
of
life
my
expenses
far
exceeded
my
previous
expectations
in
no
long
time
i
should
be
reduced
to
my
ancient
poverty
which
the
luxurious
existence
that
i
now
enjoyed
and
the
regard
due
to
my
beloved
and
helpless
companion
would
render
more
irksome
than
ever
some
scheme
to
rescue
me
from
this
fate
was
indispensable
but
my
aversion
to
labour
to
any
pursuit
the
end
of
which
was
merely
gain
and
which
would
require
application
and
attention
continued
undiminished
i
was
plunged
anew
into
dejection
and
perplexity
from
this
i
was
somewhat
relieved
by
a
plan
suggested
by
mr
thetford
i
thought
i
had
experience
of
his
knowledge
and
integrity
and
the
scheme
that
he
proposed
seemed
liable
to
no
possibility
of
miscarriage
a
ship
was
to
be
purchased
supplied
with
a
suitable
cargo
and
despatched
to
a
port
in
the
west
indies
loss
from
storms
and
enemies
was
to
be
precluded
by
insurance
every
hazard
was
to
be
enumerated
and
the
ship
and
cargo
valued
at
the
highest
rate
should
the
voyage
be
safely
performed
the
profits
would
be
double
the
original
expense
should
the
ship
be
taken
or
wrecked
the
insurers
would
have
bound
themselves
to
make
ample
speedy
and
certain
indemnification
thetford's
brother
a
wary
and
experienced
trader
was
to
be
the
supercargo
all
my
money
was
laid
out
upon
this
scheme
scarcely
enough
was
reserved
to
supply
domestic
and
personal
wants
large
debts
were
likewise
incurred
our
caution
had
as
we
conceived
annihilated
every
chance
of
failure
too
much
could
not
be
expended
on
a
project
so
infallible
and
the
vessel
amply
fitted
and
freighted
departed
on
her
voyage
an
interval
not
devoid
of
suspense
and
anxiety
succeeded
my
mercantile
inexperience
made
me
distrust
the
clearness
of
my
own
discernment
and
i
could
not
but
remember
that
my
utter
and
irretrievable
destruction
was
connected
with
the
failure
of
my
scheme
time
added
to
my
distrust
and
apprehensions
the
time
at
which
tidings
of
the
ship
were
to
be
expected
elapsed
without
affording
any
information
of
her
destiny
my
anxieties
however
were
to
be
carefully
hidden
from
the
world
i
had
taught
mankind
to
believe
that
this
project
had
been
adopted
more
for
amusement
than
gain
and
the
debts
which
i
had
contracted
seemed
to
arise
from
willingness
to
adhere
to
established
maxims
more
than
from
the
pressure
of
necessity
month
succeeded
month
and
intelligence
was
still
withheld
the
notes
which
i
had
given
for
one-third
of
the
cargo
and
for
the
premium
of
insurance
would
shortly
become
due
for
the
payment
of
the
former
and
the
cancelling
of
the
latter
i
had
relied
upon
the
expeditious
return
or
the
demonstrated
loss
of
the
vessel
neither
of
these
events
had
taken
place
my
cares
were
augmented
from
another
quarter
my
companion's
situation
now
appeared
to
be
such
as
if
our
intercourse
had
been
sanctified
by
wedlock
would
have
been
regarded
with
delight
as
it
was
no
symptoms
were
equally
to
be
deplored
consequences
as
long
as
they
were
involved
in
uncertainty
were
extenuated
or
overlooked
but
now
when
they
became
apparent
and
inevitable
were
fertile
of
distress
and
upbraiding
indefinable
fears
and
a
desire
to
monopolize
all
the
meditations
and
affections
of
this
being
had
induced
me
to
perpetuate
her
ignorance
of
any
but
her
native
language
and
debar
her
from
all
intercourse
with
the
world
my
friends
were
of
course
inquisitive
respecting
her
character
adventures
and
particularly
her
relation
to
me
the
consciousness
how
much
the
truth
redounded
to
my
dishonour
made
me
solicitous
to
lead
conjecture
astray
for
this
purpose
i
did
not
discountenance
the
conclusion
that
was
adopted
by
some--that
she
was
my
daughter
i
reflected
that
all
dangerous
surmises
would
be
effectually
precluded
by
this
belief
these
precautions
afforded
me
some
consolation
in
my
present
difficulties
it
was
requisite
to
conceal
the
lady's
condition
from
the
world
if
this
should
be
ineffectual
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
divert
suspicion
from
my
person
the
secrecy
that
i
had
practised
would
be
justified
in
the
apprehension
of
those
to
whom
the
personal
condition
of
clemenza
should
be
disclosed
by
the
feelings
of
a
father
meanwhile
it
was
an
obvious
expedient
to
remove
the
unhappy
lady
to
a
distance
from
impertinent
observers
a
rural
retreat
lonely
and
sequestered
was
easily
procured
and
hither
she
consented
to
repair
this
arrangement
being
concerted
i
had
leisure
to
reflect
upon
the
evils
which
every
hour
brought
nearer
and
which
threatened
to
exterminate
me
my
inquietudes
forbade
me
to
sleep
and
i
was
accustomed
to
rise
before
day
and
seek
some
respite
in
the
fields
returning
from
one
of
these
unseasonable
rambles
i
chanced
to
meet
you
your
resemblance
to
the
deceased
lodi
in
person
and
visage
is
remarkable
when
you
first
met
my
eye
this
similitude
startled
me
your
subsequent
appeal
to
my
compassion
was
clothed
in
such
terms
as
formed
a
powerful
contrast
with
your
dress
and
prepossessed
me
greatly
in
favour
of
your
education
and
capacity
in
my
present
hopeless
condition
every
incident
however
trivial
was
attentively
considered
with
a
view
to
extract
from
it
some
means
of
escaping
from
my
difficulties
my
love
for
the
italian
girl
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
to
keep
it
alive
had
begun
to
languish
marriage
was
impossible
and
had
now
in
some
degree
ceased
to
be
desirable
we
are
apt
to
judge
of
others
by
ourselves
the
passion
i
now
found
myself
disposed
to
ascribe
chiefly
to
fortuitous
circumstances
to
the
impulse
of
gratitude
and
the
exclusion
of
competitors
and
believed
that
your
resemblance
to
her
brother
your
age
and
personal
accomplishments
might
after
a
certain
time
and
in
consequence
of
suitable
contrivances
on
my
part
give
a
new
direction
to
her
feelings
to
gain
your
concurrence
i
relied
upon
your
simplicity
your
gratitude
and
your
susceptibility
to
the
charms
of
this
bewitching
creature
i
contemplated
likewise
another
end
mrs
wentworth
is
rich
a
youth
who
was
once
her
favourite
and
designed
to
inherit
her
fortunes
has
disappeared
for
some
years
from
the
scene
his
death
is
most
probable
but
of
that
there
is
no
satisfactory
information
the
life
of
this
person
whose
name
is
clavering
is
an
obstacle
to
some
designs
which
had
occurred
to
me
in
relation
to
this
woman
my
purposes
were
crude
and
scarcely
formed
i
need
not
swell
the
catalogue
of
my
errors
by
expatiating
upon
them
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
your
introduction
to
me
led
me
to
reflections
on
the
use
that
might
be
made
of
your
agency
in
procuring
this
lady's
acquiescence
in
my
schemes
you
were
to
be
ultimately
persuaded
to
confirm
her
in
the
belief
that
her
nephew
was
dead
to
this
consummation
it
was
indispensable
to
lead
you
by
slow
degrees
and
circuitous
paths
meanwhile
a
profound
silence
with
regard
to
your
genuine
history
was
to
be
observed
and
to
this
forbearance
your
consent
was
obtained
with
more
readiness
than
i
expected
there
was
an
additional
motive
for
the
treatment
you
received
from
me
my
personal
projects
and
cares
had
hitherto
prevented
me
from
reading
lodi's
manuscript
a
slight
inspection
however
was
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
work
was
profound
and
eloquent
my
ambition
has
panted
with
equal
avidity
after
the
reputation
of
literature
and
opulence
to
claim
the
authorship
of
this
work
was
too
harmless
and
specious
a
stratagem
not
to
be
readily
suggested
i
meant
to
translate
it
into
english
and
to
enlarge
it
by
enterprising
incidents
of
my
own
invention
my
scruples
to
assume
the
merit
of
the
original
composer
might
thus
be
removed
for
this
end
your
assistance
as
an
amanuensis
would
be
necessary
you
will
perceive
that
all
these
projects
depended
on
the
seasonable
arrival
of
intelligence
from
----
the
delay
of
another
week
would
seal
my
destruction
the
silence
might
arise
from
the
foundering
of
the
ship
and
the
destruction
of
all
on
board
in
this
case
the
insurance
was
not
forfeited
but
payment
could
not
be
obtained
within
a
year
meanwhile
the
premium
and
other
debts
must
be
immediately
discharged
and
this
was
beyond
my
power
meanwhile
i
was
to
live
in
a
manner
that
would
not
belie
my
pretensions
but
my
coffers
were
empty
i
cannot
adequately
paint
the
anxieties
with
which
i
have
been
haunted
each
hour
has
added
to
the
burden
of
my
existence
till
in
consequence
of
the
events
of
this
day
it
has
become
altogether
insupportable
some
hours
ago
i
was
summoned
by
thetford
to
his
house
the
messenger
informed
me
that
tidings
had
been
received
of
my
ship
in
answer
to
my
eager
interrogations
he
could
give
no
other
information
than
that
she
had
been
captured
by
the
british
he
was
unable
to
relate
particulars
news
of
her
safe
return
would
indeed
have
been
far
more
acceptable
but
even
this
information
was
a
source
of
infinite
congratulation
it
precluded
the
demand
of
my
insurers
the
payment
of
other
debts
might
be
postponed
for
a
month
and
my
situation
be
the
same
as
before
the
adoption
of
this
successless
scheme
hope
and
joy
were
reinstated
in
my
bosom
and
i
hasted
to
thetford's
counting-house
he
received
me
with
an
air
of
gloomy
dissatisfaction
i
accounted
for
his
sadness
by
supposing
him
averse
to
communicate
information
which
was
less
favourable
than
our
wishes
had
dictated
he
confirmed
with
visible
reluctance
the
news
of
her
capture
he
had
just
received
letters
from
his
brother
acquainting
him
with
all
particulars
and
containing
the
official
documents
of
this
transaction
this
had
no
tendency
to
damp
my
satisfaction
and
i
proceeded
to
peruse
with
eagerness
the
papers
which
he
put
into
my
hand
i
had
not
proceeded
far
when
my
joyous
hopes
vanished
two
french
mulattoes
had
after
much
solicitation
and
the
most
solemn
promises
to
carry
with
them
no
articles
which
the
laws
of
war
decree
to
be
contraband
obtained
a
passage
in
the
vessel
she
was
speedily
encountered
by
a
privateer
by
whom
every
receptacle
was
ransacked
in
a
chest
belonging
to
the
frenchmen
and
which
they
had
affirmed
to
contain
nothing
but
their
clothes
were
found
two
sabres
and
other
accoutrements
of
an
officer
of
cavalry
under
this
pretence
the
vessel
was
captured
and
condemned
and
this
was
a
cause
of
forfeiture
which
had
not
been
provided
against
in
the
contract
of
insurance
by
this
untoward
event
my
hopes
were
irreparably
blasted
the
utmost
efforts
were
demanded
to
conceal
my
thoughts
from
my
companion
the
anguish
that
preyed
upon
my
heart
was
endeavoured
to
be
masked
by
looks
of
indifference
i
pretended
to
have
been
previously
informed
by
the
messenger
not
only
of
the
capture
but
of
the
cause
that
led
to
it
and
forbore
to
expatiate
upon
my
loss
or
to
execrate
the
authors
of
my
disappointment
my
mind
however
was
the
theatre
of
discord
and
agony
and
i
waited
with
impatience
for
an
opportunity
to
leave
him
for
want
of
other
topics
i
asked
by
whom
this
information
had
been
brought
he
answered
that
the
bearer
was
captain
amos
watson
whose
vessel
had
been
forfeited
at
the
same
time
under
a
different
pretence
he
added
that
my
name
being
mentioned
accidentally
to
watson
the
latter
had
betrayed
marks
of
great
surprise
and
been
very
earnest
in
his
inquiries
respecting
my
situation
having
obtained
what
knowledge
thetford
was
able
to
communicate
the
captain
had
departed
avowing
a
former
acquaintance
with
me
and
declaring
his
intention
of
paying
me
a
visit
these
words
operated
on
my
frame
like
lightning
all
within
me
was
tumult
and
terror
and
i
rushed
precipitately
out
of
the
house
i
went
forward
with
unequal
steps
and
at
random
some
instinct
led
me
into
the
fields
and
i
was
not
apprized
of
the
direction
of
my
steps
till
looking
up
i
found
myself
upon
the
shore
of
schuylkill
thus
was
i
a
second
time
overborne
by
hopeless
and
incurable
evils
an
interval
of
motley
feelings
of
specious
artifice
and
contemptible
imposture
had
elapsed
since
my
meeting
with
the
stranger
at
wilmington
then
my
forlorn
state
had
led
me
to
the
brink
of
suicide
a
brief
and
feverish
respite
had
been
afforded
me
but
now
was
i
transported
to
the
verge
of
the
same
abyss
amos
watson
was
the
brother
of
the
angel
whom
i
had
degraded
and
destroyed
what
but
fiery
indignation
and
unappeasable
vengeance
could
lead
him
into
my
presence
with
what
heart
could
i
listen
to
his
invectives
how
could
i
endure
to
look
upon
the
face
of
one
whom
i
had
loaded
with
such
atrocious
and
intolerable
injuries
i
was
acquainted
with
his
loftiness
of
mind
his
detestation
of
injustice
and
the
whirlwind
passions
that
ingratitude
and
villany
like
mine
were
qualified
to
awaken
in
his
bosom
i
dreaded
not
his
violence
the
death
that
he
might
be
prompted
to
inflict
was
no
object
of
aversion
it
was
poverty
and
disgrace
the
detection
of
my
crimes
the
looks
and
voice
of
malediction
and
upbraiding
from
which
my
cowardice
shrunk
why
should
i
live
i
must
vanish
from
that
stage
which
i
had
lately
trodden
my
flight
must
be
instant
and
precipitate
to
be
a
fugitive
from
exasperated
creditors
and
from
the
industrious
revenge
of
watson
was
an
easy
undertaking
but
whither
could
i
fly
where
i
should
not
be
pursued
by
the
phantoms
of
remorse
by
the
dread
of
hourly
detection
by
the
necessities
of
hunger
and
thirst
in
what
scene
should
i
be
exempt
from
servitude
and
drudgery
was
my
existence
embellished
with
enjoyments
that
would
justify
my
holding
it
encumbered
with
hardships
and
immersed
in
obscurity
there
was
no
room
for
hesitation
to
rush
into
the
stream
before
me
and
put
an
end
at
once
to
my
life
and
the
miseries
inseparably
linked
with
it
was
the
only
proceeding
which
fate
had
left
to
my
choice
my
muscles
were
already
exerted
for
this
end
when
the
helpless
condition
of
clemenza
was
remembered
what
provision
could
i
make
against
the
evils
that
threatened
her
should
i
leave
her
utterly
forlorn
and
friendless
mrs
wentworth's
temper
was
forgiving
and
compassionate
adversity
had
taught
her
to
participate
and
her
wealth
enabled
her
to
relieve
distress
who
was
there
by
whom
such
powerful
claims
to
succour
and
protection
could
be
urged
as
by
this
desolate
girl
might
i
not
state
her
situation
in
a
letter
to
this
lady
and
urge
irresistible
pleas
for
the
extension
of
her
kindness
to
this
object
these
thoughts
made
me
suspend
my
steps
i
determined
to
seek
my
habitation
once
more
and
having
written
and
deposited
this
letter
to
return
to
the
execution
of
my
fatal
purpose
i
had
scarcely
reached
my
own
door
when
some
one
approached
along
the
pavement
the
form
at
first
was
undistinguishable
but
by
coming
at
length
within
the
illumination
of
a
lamp
it
was
perfectly
recognised
to
avoid
this
detested
interview
was
now
impossible
watson
approached
and
accosted
me
in
this
conflict
of
tumultuous
feelings
i
was
still
able
to
maintain
an
air
of
intrepidity
his
demeanour
was
that
of
a
man
who
struggles
with
his
rage
his
accents
were
hurried
and
scarcely
articulate
'i
have
ten
words
to
say
to
you'
said
he
'lead
into
the
house
and
to
some
private
room
my
business
with
you
will
be
despatched
in
a
breath'
i
made
him
no
answer
but
led
the
way
into
my
house
and
to
my
study
on
entering
this
room
i
put
the
light
upon
the
table
and
turning
to
my
visitant
prepared
silently
to
hear
what
he
had
to
unfold
he
struck
his
clenched
hand
against
the
table
with
violence
his
motion
was
of
that
tempestuous
kind
as
to
overwhelm
the
power
of
utterance
and
found
it
easier
to
vent
itself
in
gesticulations
than
in
words
at
length
he
exclaimed--
'it
is
well
now
has
the
hour
so
long
and
so
impatiently
demanded
by
my
vengeance
arrived
welbeck
would
that
my
first
words
could
strike
thee
dead
they
will
so
if
thou
hast
any
title
to
the
name
of
man
'my
sister
is
dead
dead
of
anguish
and
a
broken
heart
remote
from
her
friends
in
a
hovel
the
abode
of
indigence
and
misery
'her
husband
is
no
more
he
returned
after
a
long
absence
a
tedious
navigation
and
vicissitudes
of
hardships
he
flew
to
the
bosom
of
his
love
of
his
wife
she
was
gone
lost
to
him
and
to
virtue
in
a
fit
of
desperation
he
retired
to
his
chamber
and
despatched
himself
this
is
the
instrument
with
which
the
deed
was
performed'
saying
this
watson
took
a
pistol
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
to
my
head
i
lifted
not
my
hand
to
turn
aside
the
weapon
i
did
not
shudder
at
the
spectacle
or
shrink
from
his
approaching
hand
with
fingers
clasped
together
and
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
i
waited
till
his
fury
was
exhausted
he
continued--
'all
passed
in
a
few
hours
the
elopement
of
his
daughter--the
death
of
his
son
o
my
father
most
loved
and
most
venerable
of
men
to
see
thee
changed
into
a
maniac
haggard
and
wild
deterred
from
outrage
on
thyself
and
those
around
thee
by
fetters
and
stripes
what
was
it
that
saved
me
from
a
like
fate
to
view
this
hideous
ruin
and
to
think
by
whom
it
was
occasioned
yet
not
to
become
frantic
like
thee
my
father
or
not
destroy
myself
like
thee
my
brother
my
friend--
'no
for
this
hour
was
i
reserved
to
avenge
your
wrongs
and
mine
in
the
blood
of
this
ungrateful
villain'
'there'
continued
he
producing
a
second
pistol
and
tendering
it
to
me--'there
is
thy
defence
take
we
opposite
sides
of
this
table
and
fire
at
the
same
instant'
during
this
address
i
was
motionless
he
tendered
the
pistol
but
i
unclasped
not
my
hands
to
receive
it
'why
do
you
hesitate'
resumed
he
'let
the
chance
between
us
be
equal
or
fire
you
first'
'no'
said
i
'i
am
ready
to
die
by
your
hand
i
wish
it
it
will
preclude
the
necessity
of
performing
the
office
for
myself
i
have
injured
you
and
merit
all
that
your
vengeance
can
inflict
i
know
your
nature
too
well
to
believe
that
my
death
will
be
perfect
expiation
when
the
gust
of
indignation
is
past
the
remembrance
of
your
deed
will
only
add
to
your
sum
of
misery
yet
i
do
not
love
you
well
enough
to
wish
that
you
would
forbear
i
desire
to
die
and
to
die
by
another's
hand
rather
than
my
own'
'coward'
exclaimed
watson
with
augmented
vehemence
'you
know
me
too
well
to
believe
me
capable
of
assassination
vile
subterfuge
contemptible
plea
take
the
pistol
and
defend
yourself
you
want
not
the
power
or
the
will
but
knowing
that
i
spurn
at
murder
you
think
your
safety
will
be
found
in
passiveness
your
refusal
will
avail
you
little
your
fame
if
not
your
life
is
at
my
mercy
if
you
falter
now
i
will
allow
you
to
live
but
only
till
i
have
stabbed
your
reputation'
i
now
fixed
my
eyes
steadfastly
upon
him
and
spoke--'how
much
a
stranger
are
you
to
the
feelings
of
welbeck
how
poor
a
judge
of
his
cowardice
i
take
your
pistol
and
consent
to
your
conditions'
we
took
opposite
sides
of
the
table
'are
you
ready'
he
cried
'fire'
both
triggers
were
drawn
at
the
same
instant
both
pistols
were
discharged
mine
was
negligently
raised
such
is
the
untoward
chance
that
presides
over
human
affairs
such
is
the
malignant
destiny
by
which
my
steps
have
ever
been
pursued
the
bullet
whistled
harmlessly
by
me--levelled
by
an
eye
that
never
before
failed
and
with
so
small
an
interval
between
us
i
escaped
but
my
blind
and
random
shot
took
place
in
his
heart
there
is
the
fruit
of
this
disastrous
meeting
the
catalogue
of
death
is
thus
completed
thou
sleepest
watson
thy
sister
is
at
rest
and
so
art
thou
thy
vows
of
vengeance
are
at
an
end
it
was
not
reserved
for
thee
to
be
thy
own
and
thy
sister's
avenger
welbeck's
measure
of
transgressions
is
now
full
and
his
own
hand
must
execute
the
justice
that
is
due
to
him
such
was
welbeck's
tale
listened
to
by
me
with
an
eagerness
in
which
every
faculty
was
absorbed
how
adverse
to
my
dreams
were
the
incidents
that
had
just
been
related
the
curtain
was
lifted
and
a
scene
of
guilt
and
ignominy
disclosed
where
my
rash
and
inexperienced
youth
had
suspected
nothing
but
loftiness
and
magnanimity
for
a
while
the
wondrousness
of
this
tale
kept
me
from
contemplating
the
consequences
that
awaited
us
my
unfledged
fancy
had
not
hitherto
soared
to
this
pitch
all
was
astounding
by
its
novelty
or
terrific
by
its
horror
the
very
scene
of
these
offences
partook
to
my
rustic
apprehension
of
fairy
splendour
and
magical
abruptness
my
understanding
was
bemazed
and
my
senses
were
taught
to
distrust
their
own
testimony
from
this
musing
state
i
was
recalled
by
my
companion
who
said
to
me
in
solemn
accents
mervyn
i
have
but
two
requests
to
make
assist
me
to
bury
these
remains
and
then
accompany
me
across
the
river
i
have
no
power
to
compel
your
silence
on
the
acts
that
you
have
witnessed
i
have
meditated
to
benefit
as
well
as
to
injure
you
but
i
do
not
desire
that
your
demeanour
should
conform
to
any
other
standard
than
justice
you
have
promised
and
to
that
promise
i
trust
if
you
choose
to
fly
from
this
scene
to
withdraw
yourself
from
what
you
may
conceive
to
be
a
theatre
of
guilt
or
peril
the
avenues
are
open
retire
unmolested
and
in
silence
if
you
have
a
manlike
spirit
if
you
are
grateful
for
the
benefits
bestowed
upon
you
if
your
discernment
enables
you
to
see
that
compliance
with
my
request
will
entangle
you
in
no
guilt
and
betray
you
into
no
danger
stay
and
aid
me
in
hiding
these
remains
from
human
scrutiny
watson
is
beyond
the
reach
of
further
injury
i
never
intended
him
harm
though
i
have
torn
from
him
his
sister
and
friend
and
have
brought
his
life
to
an
untimely
close
to
provide
him
a
grave
is
a
duty
that
i
owe
to
the
dead
and
to
the
living
i
shall
quickly
place
myself
beyond
the
reach
of
inquisitors
and
judges
but
would
willingly
rescue
from
molestation
or
suspicion
those
whom
i
shall
leave
behind
what
would
have
been
the
fruit
of
deliberation
if
i
had
had
the
time
or
power
to
deliberate
i
know
not
my
thoughts
flowed
with
tumult
and
rapidity
to
shut
this
spectacle
from
my
view
was
the
first
impulse
but
to
desert
this
man
in
a
time
of
so
much
need
appeared
a
thankless
and
dastardly
deportment
to
remain
where
i
was
to
conform
implicitly
to
his
direction
required
no
effort
some
fear
was
connected
with
his
presence
and
with
that
of
the
dead
but
in
the
tremulous
confusion
of
my
present
thoughts
solitude
would
conjure
up
a
thousand
phantoms
i
made
no
preparation
to
depart
i
did
not
verbally
assent
to
his
proposal
he
interpreted
my
silence
into
acquiescence
he
wrapped
the
body
in
the
carpet
and
then
lifting
one
end
cast
at
me
a
look
which
indicated
his
expectations
that
i
would
aid
him
in
lifting
this
ghastly
burden
during
this
process
the
silence
was
unbroken
i
knew
not
whither
he
intended
to
convey
the
corpse
he
had
talked
of
burial
but
no
receptacle
had
been
provided
how
far
safety
might
depend
upon
his
conduct
in
this
particular
i
was
unable
to
estimate
i
was
in
too
heartless
a
mood
to
utter
my
doubts
i
followed
his
example
in
raising
the
corpse
from
the
floor
he
led
the
way
into
the
passage
and
down-stairs
having
reached
the
first
floor
he
unbolted
a
door
which
led
into
the
cellar
the
stairs
and
passage
were
illuminated
by
lamps
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
and
were
accustomed
to
burn
during
the
night
now
however
we
were
entering
darksome
and
murky
recesses
return
said
he
in
a
tone
of
command
and
fetch
the
light
i
will
wait
for
you
i
obeyed
as
i
returned
with
the
light
a
suspicion
stole
into
my
mind
that
welbeck
had
taken
this
opportunity
to
fly
and
that
on
regaining
the
foot
of
the
stairs
i
should
find
the
spot
deserted
by
all
but
the
dead
my
blood
was
chilled
by
this
image
the
momentary
resolution
it
inspired
was
to
follow
the
example
of
the
fugitive
and
leave
the
persons
whom
the
ensuing
day
might
convene
on
this
spot
to
form
their
own
conjectures
as
to
the
cause
of
this
catastrophe
meanwhile
i
cast
anxious
eyes
forward
welbeck
was
discovered
in
the
same
place
and
posture
in
which
he
had
been
left
lifting
the
corpse
and
its
shroud
in
his
arms
he
directed
me
to
follow
him
the
vaults
beneath
were
lofty
and
spacious
he
passed
from
one
to
the
other
till
we
reached
a
small
and
remote
cell
here
he
cast
his
burden
on
the
ground
in
the
fall
the
face
of
watson
chanced
to
be
disengaged
from
its
covering
its
closed
eyes
and
sunken
muscles
were
rendered
in
a
tenfold
degree
ghastly
and
rueful
by
the
feeble
light
which
the
candle
shed
upon
it
this
object
did
not
escape
the
attention
of
welbeck
he
leaned
against
the
wall
and
folding
his
arms
resigned
himself
to
reverie
he
gazed
upon
the
countenance
of
watson
but
his
looks
denoted
his
attention
to
be
elsewhere
employed
as
to
me
my
state
will
not
be
easily
described
my
eye
roved
fearfully
from
one
object
to
another
by
turns
it
was
fixed
upon
the
murdered
person
and
the
murderer
the
narrow
cell
in
which
we
stood
its
rudely-fashioned
walls
and
arches
destitute
of
communication
with
the
external
air
and
its
palpable
dark
scarcely
penetrated
by
the
rays
of
a
solitary
candle
added
to
the
silence
which
was
deep
and
universal
produced
an
impression
on
my
fancy
which
no
time
will
obliterate
perhaps
my
imagination
was
distempered
by
terror
the
incident
which
i
am
going
to
relate
may
appear
to
have
existed
only
in
my
fancy
be
that
as
it
may
i
experienced
all
the
effects
which
the
fullest
belief
is
adapted
to
produce
glancing
vaguely
at
the
countenance
of
watson
my
attention
was
arrested
by
a
convulsive
motion
in
the
eyelids
this
motion
increased
till
at
length
the
eyes
opened
and
a
glance
languid
but
wild
was
thrown
around
instantly
they
closed
and
the
tremulous
appearance
vanished
i
started
from
my
place
and
was
on
the
point
of
uttering
some
involuntary
exclamation
at
the
same
moment
welbeck
seemed
to
recover
from
his
reverie
how
is
this
said
he
why
do
we
linger
here
every
moment
is
precious
we
cannot
dig
for
him
a
grave
with
our
hands
wait
here
while
i
go
in
search
of
a
spade
saying
this
he
snatched
the
candle
from
my
hand
and
hasted
away
my
eye
followed
the
light
as
its
gleams
shifted
their
place
upon
the
walls
and
ceilings
and
gradually
vanishing
gave
place
to
unrespited
gloom
this
proceeding
was
so
unexpected
and
abrupt
that
i
had
no
time
to
remonstrate
against
it
before
i
retrieved
the
power
of
reflection
the
light
had
disappeared
and
the
footsteps
were
no
longer
to
be
heard
i
was
not
on
ordinary
occasions
destitute
of
equanimity
but
perhaps
the
imagination
of
man
is
naturally
abhorrent
of
death
until
tutored
into
indifference
by
habit
every
circumstance
combined
to
fill
me
with
shuddering
and
panic
for
a
while
i
was
enabled
to
endure
my
situation
by
the
exertions
of
my
reason
that
the
lifeless
remains
of
a
human
being
are
powerless
to
injure
or
benefit
i
was
thoroughly
persuaded
i
summoned
this
belief
to
my
aid
and
was
able
if
not
to
subdue
yet
to
curb
my
fears
i
listened
to
catch
the
sound
of
the
returning
footsteps
of
welbeck
and
hoped
that
every
new
moment
would
terminate
my
solitude
no
signal
of
his
coming
was
afforded
at
length
it
occurred
to
me
that
welbeck
had
gone
with
no
intention
to
return
that
his
malice
had
seduced
me
hither
to
encounter
the
consequences
of
his
deed
he
had
fled
and
barred
every
door
behind
him
this
suspicion
may
well
be
supposed
to
overpower
my
courage
and
to
call
forth
desperate
efforts
for
my
deliverance
i
extended
my
hands
and
went
forward
i
had
been
too
little
attentive
to
the
situation
and
direction
of
these
vaults
and
passages
to
go
forward
with
undeviating
accuracy
my
fears
likewise
tended
to
confuse
my
perceptions
and
bewilder
my
steps
notwithstanding
the
danger
of
encountering
obstructions
i
rushed
towards
the
entrance
with
precipitation
my
temerity
was
quickly
punished
in
a
moment
i
was
repelled
by
a
jutting
angle
of
the
wall
with
such
force
that
i
staggered
backward
and
fell
the
blow
was
stunning
and
when
i
recovered
my
senses
i
perceived
that
a
torrent
of
blood
was
gushing
from
my
nostrils
my
clothes
were
moistened
with
this
unwelcome
effusion
and
i
could
not
but
reflect
on
the
hazard
which
i
should
incur
by
being
detected
in
this
recess
covered
by
these
accusing
stains
this
reflection
once
more
set
me
on
my
feet
and
incited
my
exertions
i
now
proceeded
with
greater
wariness
and
caution
i
had
lost
all
distinct
notions
of
my
way
my
motions
were
at
random
all
my
labour
was
to
shun
obstructions
and
to
advance
whenever
the
vacuity
would
permit
by
this
means
the
entrance
was
at
length
found
and
after
various
efforts
i
arrived
beyond
my
hopes
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
i
ascended
but
quickly
encountered
an
insuperable
impediment
the
door
at
the
stair-head
was
closed
and
barred
my
utmost
strength
was
exerted
in
vain
to
break
the
lock
or
the
hinges
thus
were
my
direst
apprehensions
fulfilled
welbeck
had
left
me
to
sustain
the
charge
of
murder
to
obviate
suspicions
the
most
atrocious
and
plausible
that
the
course
of
human
events
is
capable
of
producing
here
i
must
remain
till
the
morrow
till
some
one
can
be
made
to
overhear
my
calls
and
come
to
my
deliverance
what
effects
will
my
appearance
produce
on
the
spectator
terrified
by
phantoms
and
stained
with
blood
shall
i
not
exhibit
the
tokens
of
a
maniac
as
well
as
an
assassin
the
corpse
of
watson
will
quickly
be
discovered
if
previous
to
this
disclosure
i
should
change
my
blood-stained
garments
and
withdraw
into
the
country
shall
i
not
be
pursued
by
the
most
vehement
suspicions
and
perhaps
hunted
to
my
obscurest
retreat
by
the
ministers
of
justice
i
am
innocent
but
my
tale
however
circumstantial
or
true
will
scarcely
suffice
for
my
vindication
my
flight
will
be
construed
into
a
proof
of
incontestable
guilt
while
harassed
by
these
thoughts
my
attention
was
attracted
by
a
faint
gleam
cast
upon
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
it
grew
stronger
hovered
for
a
moment
in
my
sight
and
then
disappeared
that
it
proceeded
from
a
lamp
or
candle
borne
by
some
one
along
the
passages
was
no
untenable
opinion
but
was
far
less
probable
than
that
the
effulgence
was
meteorous
i
confided
in
the
latter
supposition
and
fortified
myself
anew
against
the
dread
of
preternatural
dangers
my
thoughts
reverted
to
the
contemplation
of
the
hazards
and
suspicions
which
flowed
from
my
continuance
in
this
spot
in
the
midst
of
my
perturbed
musing
my
attention
was
again
recalled
by
an
illumination
like
the
former
instead
of
hovering
and
vanishing
it
was
permanent
no
ray
could
be
more
feeble
but
the
tangible
obscurity
to
which
it
succeeded
rendered
it
conspicuous
as
an
electrical
flash
for
a
while
i
eyed
it
without
moving
from
my
place
and
in
momentary
expectation
of
its
disappearance
remarking
its
stability
the
propriety
of
scrutinizing
it
more
nearly
and
of
ascertaining
the
source
whence
it
flowed
was
at
length
suggested
hope
as
well
as
curiosity
was
the
parent
of
my
conduct
though
utterly
at
a
loss
to
assign
the
cause
of
this
appearance
i
was
willing
to
believe
some
connection
between
that
cause
and
the
means
of
my
deliverance
i
had
scarcely
formed
the
resolution
of
descending
the
stair
when
my
hope
was
extinguished
by
the
recollection
that
the
cellar
had
narrow
and
grated
windows
through
which
light
from
the
street
might
possibly
have
found
access
a
second
recollection
supplanted
this
belief
for
in
my
way
to
this
staircase
my
attention
would
have
been
solicited
and
my
steps
in
some
degree
been
guided
by
light
coming
through
these
avenues
having
returned
to
the
bottom
of
the
stair
i
perceived
every
part
of
the
long-drawn
passage
illuminated
i
threw
a
glance
forward
to
the
quarter
whence
the
rays
seemed
to
proceed
and
beheld
at
a
considerable
distance
welbeck
in
the
cell
which
i
had
left
turning
up
the
earth
with
a
spade
after
a
pause
of
astonishment
the
nature
of
the
error
which
i
had
committed
rushed
upon
my
apprehension
i
now
perceived
that
the
darkness
had
misled
me
to
a
different
staircase
from
that
which
i
had
originally
descended
it
was
apparent
that
welbeck
intended
me
no
evil
but
had
really
gone
in
search
of
the
instrument
which
he
had
mentioned
this
discovery
overwhelmed
me
with
contrition
and
shame
though
it
freed
me
from
the
terrors
of
imprisonment
and
accusation
to
return
to
the
cell
which
i
had
left
and
where
welbeck
was
employed
in
his
disastrous
office
was
the
expedient
which
regard
to
my
own
safety
unavoidably
suggested
welbeck
paused
at
my
approach
and
betrayed
a
momentary
consternation
at
the
sight
of
my
ensanguined
visage
the
blood
by
some
inexplicable
process
of
nature
perhaps
by
the
counteracting
influence
of
fear
had
quickly
ceased
to
flow
whether
the
cause
of
my
evasion
and
of
my
flux
of
blood
was
guessed
or
whether
his
attention
was
withdrawn
by
more
momentous
objects
from
my
condition
he
proceeded
in
his
task
in
silence
a
shallow
bed
and
a
slight
covering
of
clay
were
provided
for
the
hapless
watson
welbeck's
movements
were
hurried
and
tremulous
his
countenance
betokened
a
mind
engrossed
by
a
single
purpose
in
some
degree
foreign
to
the
scene
before
him
an
intensity
and
fixedness
of
features
were
conspicuous
that
led
me
to
suspect
the
subversion
of
his
reason
having
finished
the
task
he
threw
aside
his
implement
he
then
put
into
my
hand
a
pocket-book
saying
it
belonged
to
watson
and
might
contain
something
serviceable
to
the
living
i
might
make
what
use
of
it
i
thought
proper
he
then
remounted
the
stairs
and
placing
the
candle
on
a
table
in
the
hall
opened
the
principal
door
and
went
forth
i
was
driven
by
a
sort
of
mechanical
impulse
in
his
footsteps
i
followed
him
because
it
was
agreeable
to
him
and
because
i
knew
not
whither
else
to
direct
my
steps
the
streets
were
desolate
and
silent
the
watchman's
call
remotely
and
faintly
heard
added
to
the
general
solemnity
i
followed
my
companion
in
a
state
of
mind
not
easily
described
i
had
no
spirit
even
to
inquire
whither
he
was
going
it
was
not
till
we
arrived
at
the
water's
edge
that
i
persuaded
myself
to
break
silence
i
then
began
to
reflect
on
the
degree
in
which
his
present
schemes
might
endanger
welbeck
or
myself
i
had
acted
long
enough
a
servile
and
mechanical
part
and
been
guided
by
blind
and
foreign
impulses
it
was
time
to
lay
aside
my
fetters
and
demand
to
know
whither
the
path
tended
in
which
i
was
importuned
to
walk
meanwhile
i
found
myself
entangled
among
boats
and
shipping
i
am
unable
to
describe
the
spot
by
any
indisputable
tokens
i
know
merely
that
it
was
the
termination
of
one
of
the
principal
streets
here
welbeck
selected
a
boat
and
prepared
to
enter
it
for
a
moment
i
hesitated
to
comply
with
his
apparent
invitation
i
stammered
out
an
interrogation--why
is
this
why
should
we
cross
the
river
what
service
can
i
do
for
you
i
ought
to
know
the
purpose
of
my
voyage
before
i
enter
it
he
checked
himself
and
surveyed
me
for
a
minute
in
silence
what
do
you
fear
said
he
have
i
not
explained
my
wishes
merely
cross
the
river
with
me
for
i
cannot
navigate
a
boat
by
myself
is
there
any
thing
arduous
or
mysterious
in
this
undertaking
we
part
on
the
jersey
shore
and
i
shall
leave
you
to
your
destiny
all
i
shall
ask
from
you
will
be
silence
and
to
hide
from
mankind
what
you
know
concerning
me
he
now
entered
the
boat
and
urged
me
to
follow
his
example
i
reluctantly
complied
i
perceived
that
the
boat
contained
but
one
oar
and
that
was
a
small
one
he
seemed
startled
and
thrown
into
great
perplexity
by
this
discovery
it
will
be
impossible
said
he
in
a
tone
of
panic
and
vexation
to
procure
another
at
this
hour
what
is
to
be
done
this
impediment
was
by
no
means
insuperable
i
had
sinewy
arms
and
knew
well
how
to
use
an
oar
for
the
double
purpose
of
oar
and
rudder
i
took
my
station
at
the
stern
and
quickly
extricated
the
boat
from
its
neighbours
and
from
the
wharves
i
was
wholly
unacquainted
with
the
river
the
bar
by
which
it
was
encumbered
i
knew
to
exist
but
in
what
direction
and
to
what
extent
it
existed
and
how
it
might
be
avoided
in
the
present
state
of
the
tide
i
knew
not
it
was
probable
therefore
unknowing
as
i
was
of
the
proper
track
that
our
boat
would
speedily
have
grounded
my
attention
meanwhile
was
fixed
upon
the
oar
my
companion
sat
at
the
prow
and
was
in
a
considerable
degree
unnoticed
i
cast
my
eyes
occasionally
at
the
scene
which
i
had
left
its
novelty
joined
with
the
incidents
of
my
condition
threw
me
into
a
state
of
suspense
and
wonder
which
frequently
slackened
my
hand
and
left
the
vessel
to
be
driven
by
the
downward
current
lights
were
sparingly
seen
and
these
were
perpetually
fluctuating
as
masts
yards
and
hulls
were
interposed
and
passed
before
them
in
proportion
as
we
receded
from
the
shore
the
clamours
seemed
to
multiply
and
the
suggestion
that
the
city
was
involved
in
confusion
and
uproar
did
not
easily
give
way
to
maturer
thoughts
twelve
was
the
hour
cried
and
this
ascended
at
once
from
all
quarters
and
was
mingled
with
the
baying
of
dogs
so
as
to
produce
trepidation
and
alarm
from
this
state
of
magnificent
and
awful
feeling
i
was
suddenly
called
by
the
conduct
of
welbeck
we
had
scarcely
moved
two
hundred
yards
from
the
shore
when
he
plunged
into
the
water
the
first
conception
was
that
some
implement
or
part
of
the
boat
had
fallen
over-board
i
looked
back
and
perceived
that
his
seat
was
vacant
in
my
first
astonishment
i
loosened
my
hold
of
the
oar
and
it
floated
away
the
surface
was
smooth
as
glass
and
the
eddy
occasioned
by
his
sinking
was
scarcely
visible
i
had
not
time
to
determine
whether
this
was
designed
or
accidental
its
suddenness
deprived
me
of
the
power
to
exert
myself
for
his
succour
i
wildly
gazed
around
me
in
hopes
of
seeing
him
rise
after
some
time
my
attention
was
drawn
by
the
sound
of
agitation
in
the
water
to
a
considerable
distance
it
was
too
dark
for
any
thing
to
be
distinctly
seen
there
was
no
cry
for
help
the
noise
was
like
that
of
one
vigorously
struggling
for
a
moment
and
then
sinking
to
the
bottom
i
listened
with
painful
eagerness
but
was
unable
to
distinguish
a
third
signal
he
sunk
to
rise
no
more
i
was
for
a
time
inattentive
to
my
own
situation
the
dreadfulness
and
unexpectedness
of
this
catastrophe
occupied
me
wholly
the
quick
motion
of
the
lights
upon
the
shore
showed
me
that
i
was
borne
rapidly
along
with
the
tide
how
to
help
myself
how
to
impede
my
course
or
to
regain
either
shore
since
i
had
lost
the
oar
i
was
unable
to
tell
i
was
no
less
at
a
loss
to
conjecture
whither
the
current
if
suffered
to
control
my
vehicle
would
finally
transport
me
the
disappearance
of
lights
and
buildings
and
the
diminution
of
the
noises
acquainted
me
that
i
had
passed
the
town
it
was
impossible
longer
to
hesitate
the
shore
was
to
be
regained
by
one
way
only
which
was
swimming
to
any
exploit
of
this
kind
my
strength
and
my
skill
were
adequate
i
threw
away
my
loose
gown
put
the
pocket-book
of
the
unfortunate
watson
in
my
mouth
to
preserve
it
from
being
injured
by
moisture
and
committed
myself
to
the
stream
i
landed
in
a
spot
incommoded
with
mud
and
reeds
i
sunk
knee-deep
into
the
former
and
was
exhausted
by
the
fatigue
of
extricating
myself
at
length
i
recovered
firm
ground
and
threw
myself
on
the
turf
to
repair
my
wasted
strength
and
to
reflect
on
the
measures
which
my
future
welfare
enjoined
me
to
pursue
what
condition
was
ever
parallel
to
mine
the
transactions
of
the
last
three
days
resembled
the
monstrous
creations
of
delirium
they
were
painted
with
vivid
hues
on
my
memory
but
so
rapid
and
incongruous
were
these
transitions
that
i
almost
denied
belief
to
their
reality
they
exercised
a
bewildering
and
stupefying
influence
on
my
mind
from
which
the
meditations
of
an
hour
were
scarcely
sufficient
to
relieve
me
gradually
i
recovered
the
power
of
arranging
my
ideas
and
forming
conclusions
welbeck
was
dead
his
property
was
swallowed
up
and
his
creditors
left
to
wonder
at
his
disappearance
all
that
was
left
was
the
furniture
of
his
house
to
which
mrs
wentworth
would
lay
claim
in
discharge
of
the
unpaid
rent
what
now
was
the
destiny
that
awaited
the
lost
and
friendless
mademoiselle
lodi
where
was
she
concealed
welbeck
had
dropped
no
intimation
by
which
i
might
be
led
to
suspect
the
place
of
her
abode
if
my
power
in
other
respects
could
have
contributed
aught
to
her
relief
my
ignorance
of
her
asylum
had
utterly
disabled
me
but
what
of
the
murdered
person
he
had
suddenly
vanished
from
the
face
of
the
earth
his
fate
and
the
place
of
his
interment
would
probably
be
suspected
and
ascertained
was
i
sure
to
escape
from
the
consequences
of
this
deed
watson
had
relatives
and
friends
what
influence
on
their
state
and
happiness
his
untimely
and
mysterious
fate
would
possess
it
was
obvious
to
inquire
this
idea
led
me
to
the
recollection
of
his
pocket-book
some
papers
might
be
there
explanatory
of
his
situation
i
resumed
my
feet
i
knew
not
where
to
direct
my
steps
i
was
dropping
with
wet
and
shivering
with
the
cold
i
was
destitute
of
habitation
and
friend
i
had
neither
money
nor
any
valuable
thing
in
my
possession
i
moved
forward
mechanically
and
at
random
where
i
landed
was
at
no
great
distance
from
the
verge
of
the
town
in
a
short
time
i
discovered
the
glimmering
of
a
distant
lamp
to
this
i
directed
my
steps
and
here
i
paused
to
examine
the
contents
of
the
pocket-book
i
found
three
bank-notes
each
of
fifty
dollars
enclosed
in
a
piece
of
blank
paper
besides
these
were
three
letters
apparently
written
by
his
wife
and
dated
at
baltimore
they
were
brief
but
composed
in
a
strain
of
great
tenderness
and
containing
affecting
allusions
to
their
child
i
could
gather
from
their
date
and
tenor
that
they
were
received
during
his
absence
on
his
recent
voyage
that
her
condition
was
considerably
necessitous
and
surrounded
by
wants
which
their
prolonged
separation
had
increased
the
fourth
letter
was
open
and
seemed
to
have
been
very
lately
written
it
was
directed
to
mrs
mary
watson
he
informed
her
in
it
of
his
arrival
at
philadelphia
from
st
domingo
of
the
loss
of
his
ship
and
cargo
and
of
his
intention
to
hasten
home
with
all
possible
expedition
he
told
her
that
all
was
lost
but
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
the
greater
part
of
which
he
should
bring
with
him
to
relieve
her
more
pressing
wants
the
letter
was
signed
and
folded
and
superscribed
but
unsealed
a
little
consideration
showed
me
in
what
manner
it
became
me
on
this
occasion
to
demean
myself
i
put
the
bank-notes
in
the
letter
and
sealed
it
with
a
wafer
a
few
of
which
were
found
in
the
pocket-book
i
hesitated
some
time
whether
i
should
add
any
thing
to
the
information
which
the
letter
contained
by
means
of
a
pencil
which
offered
itself
to
my
view
but
i
concluded
to
forbear
i
could
select
no
suitable
terms
in
which
to
communicate
the
mournful
truth
i
resolved
to
deposit
this
letter
at
the
post-office
where
i
knew
letters
could
be
left
at
all
hours
my
reflections
at
length
reverted
to
my
own
condition
what
was
the
fate
reserved
for
me
how
far
my
safety
might
be
affected
by
remaining
in
the
city
in
consequence
of
the
disappearance
of
welbeck
and
my
known
connection
with
the
fugitive
it
was
impossible
to
foresee
my
fears
readily
suggested
innumerable
embarrassments
and
inconveniences
which
would
flow
from
this
source
besides
on
what
pretence
should
i
remain
to
whom
could
i
apply
for
protection
or
employment
all
avenues
even
to
subsistence
were
shut
against
me
the
country
was
my
sole
asylum
here
in
exchange
for
my
labour
i
could
at
least
purchase
food
safety
and
repose
but
if
my
choice
pointed
to
the
country
there
was
no
reason
for
a
moment's
delay
it
would
be
prudent
to
regain
the
fields
and
be
far
from
this
detested
city
before
the
rising
of
the
sun
meanwhile
i
was
chilled
and
chafed
by
the
clothes
that
i
wore
to
change
them
for
others
was
absolutely
necessary
to
my
ease
the
clothes
which
i
wore
were
not
my
own
and
were
extremely
unsuitable
to
my
new
condition
my
rustic
and
homely
garb
was
deposited
in
my
chamber
at
welbeck's
these
thoughts
suggested
the
design
of
returning
thither
i
considered
that
probably
the
servants
had
not
been
alarmed
that
the
door
was
unfastened
and
the
house
was
accessible
it
would
be
easy
to
enter
and
retire
without
notice
and
this
not
without
some
waverings
and
misgivings
i
presently
determined
to
do
having
deposited
my
letter
at
the
office
i
proceeded
to
my
late
abode
i
approached
and
lifted
the
latch
with
caution
there
were
no
appearances
of
any
one
having
been
disturbed
i
procured
a
light
in
the
kitchen
and
hied
softly
and
with
dubious
footsteps
to
my
chamber
there
i
disrobed
and
resumed
my
check
shirt
and
trowsers
and
fustian
coat
this
change
being
accomplished
nothing
remained
but
that
i
should
strike
into
the
country
with
the
utmost
expedition
in
a
momentary
review
which
i
took
of
the
past
the
design
for
which
welbeck
professed
to
have
originally
detained
me
in
his
service
occurred
to
my
mind
i
knew
the
danger
of
reasoning
loosely
on
the
subject
of
property
to
any
trinket
or
piece
of
furniture
in
this
house
i
did
not
allow
myself
to
question
the
right
of
mrs
wentworth
a
right
accruing
to
her
in
consequence
of
welbeck's
failure
in
the
payment
of
his
rent
but
there
was
one
thing
which
i
felt
an
irresistible
desire
and
no
scruples
which
should
forbid
me
to
possess
and
that
was
the
manuscript
to
which
welbeck
had
alluded
as
having
been
written
by
the
deceased
lodi
i
was
well
instructed
in
latin
and
knew
the
tuscan
language
to
be
nearly
akin
to
it
i
despaired
not
of
being
at
some
time
able
to
cultivate
this
language
and
believed
that
the
possession
of
this
manuscript
might
essentially
contribute
to
this
end
as
well
as
to
many
others
equally
beneficial
it
was
easy
to
conjecture
that
the
volume
was
to
be
found
among
his
printed
books
and
it
was
scarcely
less
easy
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
this
conjecture
i
entered
not
without
tremulous
sensations
into
the
apartment
which
had
been
the
scene
of
the
disastrous
interview
between
watson
and
welbeck
at
every
step
i
almost
dreaded
to
behold
the
spectre
of
the
former
rise
before
me
numerous
and
splendid
volumes
were
arranged
on
mahogany
shelves
and
screened
by
doors
of
glass
i
ran
swiftly
over
their
names
and
was
at
length
so
fortunate
as
to
light
upon
the
book
of
which
i
was
in
search
i
immediately
secured
it
and
leaving
the
candle
extinguished
on
a
table
in
the
parlour
i
once
more
issued
forth
into
the
street
with
light
steps
and
palpitating
heart
i
turned
my
face
towards
the
country
my
necessitous
condition
i
believed
would
justify
me
in
passing
without
payment
the
schuylkill
bridge
and
the
eastern
sky
began
to
brighten
with
the
dawn
of
morning
not
till
i
had
gained
the
distance
of
nine
miles
from
the
city
such
is
the
tale
which
i
proposed
to
relate
to
you
such
are
the
memorable
incidents
of
five
days
of
my
life
from
which
i
have
gathered
more
instruction
than
from
the
whole
tissue
of
my
previous
existence
such
are
the
particulars
of
my
knowledge
respecting
the
crimes
and
misfortunes
of
welbeck
which
the
insinuations
of
wortley
and
my
desire
to
retain
your
good
opinion
have
induced
me
to
unfold
mervyn's
pause
allowed
his
auditors
to
reflect
on
the
particulars
of
his
narration
and
to
compare
them
with
the
facts
with
a
knowledge
of
which
their
own
observation
had
supplied
them
my
profession
introduced
me
to
the
friendship
of
mrs
wentworth
by
whom
after
the
disappearance
of
welbeck
many
circumstances
respecting
him
had
been
mentioned
she
particularly
dwelt
upon
the
deportment
and
appearance
of
this
youth
at
the
single
interview
which
took
place
between
them
and
her
representations
were
perfectly
conformable
to
those
which
mervyn
had
himself
delivered
previously
to
this
interview
welbeck
had
insinuated
to
her
that
a
recent
event
had
put
him
in
possession
of
the
truth
respecting
the
destiny
of
clavering
a
kinsman
of
his
had
arrived
from
portugal
by
whom
this
intelligence
had
been
brought
he
dexterously
eluded
her
entreaties
to
be
furnished
with
minuter
information
or
to
introduce
this
kinsman
to
her
acquaintance
as
soon
as
mervyn
was
ushered
into
her
presence
she
suspected
him
to
be
the
person
to
whom
welbeck
had
alluded
and
this
suspicion
his
conversation
had
confirmed
she
was
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
the
reasons
of
the
silence
which
he
so
pertinaciously
maintained
her
uneasiness
however
prompted
her
to
renew
her
solicitations
on
the
day
subsequent
to
the
catastrophe
related
by
mervyn
she
sent
a
messenger
to
welbeck
with
a
request
to
see
him
gabriel
the
black
servant
informed
the
messenger
that
his
master
had
gone
into
the
country
for
a
week
at
the
end
of
the
week
a
messenger
was
again
despatched
with
the
same
errand
he
called
and
knocked
but
no
one
answered
his
signals
he
examined
the
entrance
by
the
kitchen
but
every
avenue
was
closed
it
appeared
that
the
house
was
wholly
deserted
these
appearances
naturally
gave
birth
to
curiosity
and
suspicion
the
house
was
repeatedly
examined
but
the
solitude
and
silence
within
continued
the
same
the
creditors
of
welbeck
were
alarmed
by
these
appearances
and
their
claims
to
the
property
remaining
in
the
house
were
precluded
by
mrs
wentworth
who
as
owner
of
the
mansion
was
legally
entitled
to
the
furniture
in
place
of
the
rent
which
welbeck
had
suffered
to
accumulate
on
examining
the
dwelling
all
that
was
valuable
and
portable
particularly
linen
and
plate
was
removed
the
remainder
was
distrained
but
the
tumults
of
pestilence
succeeded
and
hindered
it
from
being
sold
things
were
allowed
to
continue
in
their
former
situation
and
the
house
was
carefully
secured
we
had
no
leisure
to
form
conjectures
on
the
causes
of
this
desertion
an
explanation
was
afforded
us
by
the
narrative
of
this
youth
it
is
probable
that
the
servants
finding
their
master's
absence
continue
had
pillaged
the
house
and
fled
meanwhile
though
our
curiosity
with
regard
to
welbeck
was
appeased
it
was
obvious
to
inquire
by
what
series
of
inducements
and
events
mervyn
was
reconducted
to
the
city
and
led
to
the
spot
where
i
first
met
with
him
we
intimated
our
wishes
in
this
respect
and
our
young
friend
readily
consented
to
take
up
the
thread
of
his
story
and
bring
it
down
to
the
point
that
was
desired
for
this
purpose
the
ensuing
evening
was
selected
having
at
an
early
hour
shut
ourselves
up
from
all
intruders
and
visitors
he
continued
as
follows





i
have
mentioned
that
by
sunrise
i
had
gained
the
distance
of
many
miles
from
the
city
my
purpose
was
to
stop
at
the
first
farm-house
and
seek
employment
as
a
day-labourer
the
first
person
whom
i
observed
was
a
man
of
placid
mien
and
plain
garb
habitual
benevolence
was
apparent
amidst
the
wrinkles
of
age
he
was
traversing
his
buckwheat-field
and
measuring
as
it
seemed
the
harvest
that
was
now
nearly
ripe
i
accosted
him
with
diffidence
and
explained
my
wishes
he
listened
to
my
tale
with
complacency
inquired
into
my
name
and
family
and
into
my
qualifications
for
the
office
to
which
i
aspired
my
answers
were
candid
and
full
why
said
he
i
believe
thou
and
i
can
make
a
bargain
we
will
at
least
try
each
other
for
a
week
or
two
if
it
does
not
suit
our
mutual
convenience
we
can
change
the
morning
is
damp
and
cool
and
thy
plight
does
not
appear
the
most
comfortable
that
can
be
imagined
come
to
the
house
and
eat
some
breakfast
the
behaviour
of
this
good
man
filled
me
with
gratitude
and
joy
methought
i
could
embrace
him
as
a
father
and
entrance
into
his
house
appeared
like
return
to
a
long-lost
and
much-loved
home
my
desolate
and
lonely
condition
appeared
to
be
changed
for
paternal
regards
and
the
tenderness
of
friendship
these
emotions
were
confirmed
and
heightened
by
every
object
that
presented
itself
under
this
roof
the
family
consisted
of
mrs
hadwin
two
simple
and
affectionate
girls
his
daughters
and
servants
the
manners
of
this
family
quiet
artless
and
cordial
the
occupations
allotted
me
the
land
by
which
the
dwelling
was
surrounded
its
pure
airs
romantic
walks
and
exhaustless
fertility
constituted
a
powerful
contrast
to
the
scenes
which
i
had
left
behind
and
were
congenial
with
every
dictate
of
my
understanding
and
every
sentiment
that
glowed
in
my
heart
my
youth
mental
cultivation
and
circumspect
deportment
entitled
me
to
deference
and
confidence
each
hour
confirmed
me
in
the
good
opinion
of
mr
hadwin
and
in
the
affections
of
his
daughters
in
the
mind
of
my
employer
the
simplicity
of
the
husbandman
and
the
devotion
of
the
quaker
were
blended
with
humanity
and
intelligence
the
sisters
susan
and
eliza
were
unacquainted
with
calamity
and
vice
through
the
medium
of
either
observation
or
books
they
were
strangers
to
the
benefits
of
an
elaborate
education
but
they
were
endowed
with
curiosity
and
discernment
and
had
not
suffered
their
slender
means
of
instruction
to
remain
unimproved
the
sedateness
of
the
elder
formed
an
amusing
contrast
with
the
laughing
eye
and
untamable
vivacity
of
the
younger
but
they
smiled
and
they
wept
in
unison
they
thought
and
acted
in
different
but
not
discordant
keys
on
all
momentous
occasions
they
reasoned
and
felt
alike
in
ordinary
cases
they
separated
as
it
were
into
different
tracks
but
this
diversity
was
productive
not
of
jarring
but
of
harmony
a
romantic
and
untutored
disposition
like
mine
may
be
supposed
liable
to
strong
impressions
from
perpetual
converse
with
persons
of
their
age
and
sex
the
elder
was
soon
discovered
to
have
already
disposed
of
her
affections
the
younger
was
free
and
somewhat
that
is
more
easily
conceived
than
named
stole
insensibly
upon
my
heart
the
images
that
haunted
me
at
home
and
abroad
in
her
absence
and
her
presence
gradually
coalesced
into
one
shape
and
gave
birth
to
an
incessant
train
of
latent
palpitations
and
indefinable
hopes
my
days
were
little
else
than
uninterrupted
reveries
and
night
only
called
up
phantoms
more
vivid
and
equally
enchanting
the
memorable
incidents
which
had
lately
happened
scarcely
counterpoised
my
new
sensations
or
diverted
my
contemplations
from
the
present
my
views
were
gradually
led
to
rest
upon
futurity
and
in
that
i
quickly
found
cause
of
circumspection
and
dread
my
present
labours
were
light
and
were
sufficient
for
my
subsistence
in
a
single
state
but
wedlock
was
the
parent
of
new
wants
and
of
new
cares
mr
hadwin's
possessions
were
adequate
to
his
own
frugal
maintenance
but
divided
between
his
children
would
be
too
scanty
for
either
besides
this
division
could
only
take
place
at
his
death
and
that
was
an
event
whose
speedy
occurrence
was
neither
desirable
nor
probable
another
obstacle
was
now
remembered
hadwin
was
the
conscientious
member
of
a
sect
which
forbade
the
marriage
of
its
votaries
with
those
of
a
different
communion
i
had
been
trained
in
an
opposite
creed
and
imagined
it
impossible
that
i
should
ever
become
a
proselyte
to
quakerism
it
only
remained
for
me
to
feign
conversion
or
to
root
out
the
opinions
of
my
friend
and
win
her
consent
to
a
secret
marriage
whether
hypocrisy
was
eligible
was
no
subject
of
deliberation
if
the
possession
of
all
that
ambition
can
conceive
were
added
to
the
transports
of
union
with
eliza
hadwin
and
offered
as
the
price
of
dissimulation
it
would
have
been
instantly
rejected
my
external
goods
were
not
abundant
nor
numerous
but
the
consciousness
of
rectitude
was
mine
and
in
competition
with
this
the
luxury
of
the
heart
and
of
the
senses
the
gratifications
of
boundless
ambition
and
inexhaustible
wealth
were
contemptible
and
frivolous
the
conquest
of
eliza's
errors
was
easy
but
to
introduce
discord
and
sorrow
into
this
family
was
an
act
of
the
utmost
ingratitude
and
profligacy
it
was
only
requisite
for
my
understanding
clearly
to
discern
to
be
convinced
of
the
insuperability
of
this
obstacle
it
was
manifest
therefore
that
the
point
to
which
my
wishes
tended
was
placed
beyond
my
reach
to
foster
my
passion
was
to
foster
a
disease
destructive
either
of
my
integrity
or
my
existence
it
was
indispensable
to
fix
my
thoughts
upon
a
different
object
and
to
debar
myself
even
from
her
intercourse
to
ponder
on
themes
foreign
to
my
darling
image
and
to
seclude
myself
from
her
society
at
hours
which
had
usually
been
spent
with
her
were
difficult
tasks
the
latter
was
the
least
practicable
i
had
to
contend
with
eyes
which
alternately
wondered
at
and
upbraided
me
for
my
unkindness
she
was
wholly
unaware
of
the
nature
of
her
own
feelings
and
this
ignorance
made
her
less
scrupulous
in
the
expression
of
her
sentiments
hitherto
i
had
needed
not
employment
beyond
myself
and
my
companions
now
my
new
motives
made
me
eager
to
discover
some
means
of
controlling
and
beguiling
my
thoughts
in
this
state
the
manuscript
of
lodi
occurred
to
me
in
my
way
hither
i
had
resolved
to
make
the
study
of
the
language
of
this
book
and
the
translation
of
its
contents
into
english
the
business
and
solace
of
my
leisure
now
this
resolution
was
revived
with
new
force
my
project
was
perhaps
singular
the
ancient
language
of
italy
possessed
a
strong
affinity
with
the
modern
my
knowledge
of
the
former
was
my
only
means
of
gaining
the
latter
i
had
no
grammar
or
vocabulary
to
explain
how
far
the
meanings
and
inflections
of
tuscan
words
varied
from
the
roman
dialect
i
was
to
ponder
on
each
sentence
and
phrase
to
select
among
different
conjectures
the
most
plausible
and
to
ascertain
the
true
by
patient
and
repeated
scrutiny
this
undertaking
fantastic
and
impracticable
as
it
may
seem
proved
upon
experiment
to
be
within
the
compass
of
my
powers
the
detail
of
my
progress
would
be
curious
and
instructive
what
impediments
in
the
attainment
of
a
darling
purpose
human
ingenuity
and
patience
are
able
to
surmount
how
much
may
be
done
by
strenuous
and
solitary
efforts
how
the
mind
unassisted
may
draw
forth
the
principles
of
inflection
and
arrangement
may
profit
by
remote
analogous
and
latent
similitudes
would
be
forcibly
illustrated
by
my
example
but
the
theme
however
attractive
must
for
the
present
be
omitted
my
progress
was
slow
but
the
perception
of
hourly
improvement
afforded
me
unspeakable
pleasure
having
arrived
near
the
last
pages
i
was
able
to
pursue
with
little
interruption
the
thread
of
an
eloquent
narration
the
triumph
of
a
leader
of
outlaws
over
the
popular
enthusiasm
of
the
milanese
and
the
claims
of
neighbouring
potentates
was
about
to
be
depicted
the
condottiero
sforza
had
taken
refuge
from
his
enemies
in
a
tomb
accidentally
discovered
amidst
the
ruins
of
a
roman
fortress
in
the
apennines
he
had
sought
this
recess
for
the
sake
of
concealment
but
found
in
it
a
treasure
by
which
he
would
be
enabled
to
secure
the
wavering
and
venal
faith
of
that
crew
of
ruffians
that
followed
his
standard
provided
he
fell
not
into
the
hands
of
the
enemies
who
were
now
in
search
of
him
my
tumultuous
curiosity
was
suddenly
checked
by
the
following
leaves
being
glued
together
at
the
edges
to
dissever
them
without
injury
to
the
written
spaces
was
by
no
means
easy
i
proceeded
to
the
task
not
without
precipitation
the
edges
were
torn
away
and
the
leaves
parted
it
may
be
thought
that
i
took
up
the
thread
where
it
had
been
broken
but
no
the
object
that
my
eyes
encountered
and
which
the
cemented
leaves
had
so
long
concealed
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
most
capricious
or
lawless
fancy
to
have
prefigured
yet
it
bore
a
shadowy
resemblance
to
the
images
with
which
my
imagination
was
previously
occupied
i
opened
and
beheld--a
bank-note
to
the
first
transports
of
surprise
the
conjecture
succeeded
that
the
remaining
leaves
cemented
together
in
the
same
manner
might
enclose
similar
bills
they
were
hastily
separated
and
the
conjecture
was
verified
my
sensations
at
this
discovery
were
of
an
inexplicable
kind
i
gazed
at
the
notes
in
silence
i
moved
my
finger
over
them
held
them
in
different
positions
read
and
reread
the
name
of
each
sum
and
the
signature
added
them
together
and
repeated
to
myself--twenty
thousand
dollars
they
are
mine
and
by
such
means
this
sum
would
have
redeemed
the
fallen
fortunes
of
welbeck
the
dying
lodi
was
unable
to
communicate
all
the
contents
of
this
inestimable
volume
he
had
divided
his
treasure
with
a
view
to
its
greater
safety
between
this
volume
and
his
pocket-book
death
hasted
upon
him
too
suddenly
to
allow
him
to
explain
his
precautions
welbeck
had
placed
the
book
in
his
collection
purposing
some
time
to
peruse
it
but
deterred
by
anxieties
which
the
perusal
would
have
dissipated
he
rushed
to
desperation
and
suicide
from
which
some
evanescent
contingency
by
unfolding
this
treasure
to
his
view
would
have
effectually
rescued
him
but
was
this
event
to
be
regretted
this
sum
like
the
former
would
probably
have
been
expended
in
the
same
pernicious
prodigality
his
career
would
have
continued
some
time
longer
but
his
inveterate
habits
would
have
finally
conducted
his
existence
to
the
same
criminal
and
ignominious
close
but
the
destiny
of
welbeck
was
accomplished
the
money
was
placed
without
guilt
or
artifice
in
my
possession
my
fortune
had
been
thus
unexpectedly
and
wondrously
propitious
how
was
i
to
profit
by
her
favour
would
not
this
sum
enable
me
to
gather
round
me
all
the
instruments
of
pleasure
equipage
and
palace
and
a
multitude
of
servants
polished
mirrors
splendid
hangings
banquets
and
flatterers
were
equally
abhorrent
to
my
taste
and
my
principles
the
accumulation
of
knowledge
and
the
diffusion
of
happiness
in
which
riches
may
be
rendered
eminently
instrumental
were
the
only
precepts
of
duty
and
the
only
avenues
to
genuine
felicity
but
what
said
i
is
my
title
to
this
money
by
retaining
it
shall
i
not
be
as
culpable
as
welbeck
it
came
into
his
possession
as
it
came
into
mine
without
a
crime
but
my
knowledge
of
the
true
proprietor
is
equally
certain
and
the
claims
of
the
unfortunate
stranger
are
as
valid
as
ever
indeed
if
utility
and
not
law
be
the
measure
of
justice
her
claim
desolate
and
indigent
as
she
is
unfitted
by
her
past
life
by
the
softness
and
the
prejudices
of
her
education
for
contending
with
calamity
is
incontestable
as
to
me
health
and
diligence
will
give
me
not
only
the
competence
which
i
seek
but
the
power
of
enjoying
it
if
my
present
condition
be
unchangeable
i
shall
not
be
unhappy
my
occupations
are
salutary
and
meritorious
i
am
a
stranger
to
the
cares
as
well
as
to
the
enjoyment
of
riches
abundant
means
of
knowledge
are
possessed
by
me
as
long
as
i
have
eyes
to
gaze
at
man
and
at
nature
as
they
are
exhibited
in
their
original
forms
or
in
books
the
precepts
of
my
duty
cannot
be
mistaken
the
lady
must
be
sought
and
the
money
restored
to
her
certain
obstacles
existed
to
the
immediate
execution
of
this
scheme
how
should
i
conduct
my
search
what
apology
should
i
make
for
withdrawing
thus
abruptly
and
contrary
to
the
terms
of
an
agreement
into
which
i
had
lately
entered
from
the
family
and
service
of
my
friend
and
benefactor
hadwin
my
thoughts
were
called
away
from
pursuing
these
inquiries
by
a
rumour
which
had
gradually
swelled
to
formidable
dimensions
and
which
at
length
reached
us
in
our
quiet
retreats
the
city
we
were
told
was
involved
in
confusion
and
panic
for
a
pestilential
disease
had
begun
its
destructive
progress
magistrates
and
citizens
were
flying
to
the
country
the
numbers
of
the
sick
multiplied
beyond
all
example
even
in
the
pest-affected
cities
of
the
levant
the
malady
was
malignant
and
unsparing
the
usual
occupations
and
amusements
of
life
were
at
an
end
terror
had
exterminated
all
the
sentiments
of
nature
wives
were
deserted
by
husbands
and
children
by
parents
some
had
shut
themselves
in
their
houses
and
debarred
themselves
from
all
communication
with
the
rest
of
mankind
the
consternation
of
others
had
destroyed
their
understanding
and
their
misguided
steps
hurried
them
into
the
midst
of
the
danger
which
they
had
previously
laboured
to
shun
men
were
seized
by
this
disease
in
the
streets
passengers
fled
from
them
entrance
into
their
own
dwellings
was
denied
to
them
they
perished
in
the
public
ways
the
chambers
of
disease
were
deserted
and
the
sick
left
to
die
of
negligence
none
could
be
found
to
remove
the
lifeless
bodies
their
remains
suffered
to
decay
by
piecemeal
filled
the
air
with
deadly
exhalations
and
added
tenfold
to
the
devastation
such
was
the
tale
distorted
and
diversified
a
thousand
ways
by
the
credulity
and
exaggeration
of
the
tellers
at
first
i
listened
to
the
story
with
indifference
or
mirth
methought
it
was
confuted
by
its
own
extravagance
the
enormity
and
variety
of
such
an
evil
made
it
unworthy
to
be
believed
i
expected
that
every
new
day
would
detect
the
absurdity
and
fallacy
of
such
representations
every
new
day
however
added
to
the
number
of
witnesses
and
the
consistency
of
the
tale
till
at
length
it
was
not
possible
to
withhold
my
faith
this
rumour
was
of
a
nature
to
absorb
and
suspend
the
whole
soul
a
certain
sublimity
is
connected
with
enormous
dangers
that
imparts
to
our
consternation
or
our
pity
a
tincture
of
the
pleasing
this
at
least
may
be
experienced
by
those
who
are
beyond
the
verge
of
peril
my
own
person
was
exposed
to
no
hazard
i
had
leisure
to
conjure
up
terrific
images
and
to
personate
the
witnesses
and
sufferers
of
this
calamity
this
employment
was
not
enjoined
upon
me
by
necessity
but
was
ardently
pursued
and
must
therefore
have
been
recommended
by
some
nameless
charm
others
were
very
differently
affected
as
often
as
the
tale
was
embellished
with
new
incidents
or
enforced
by
new
testimony
the
hearer
grew
pale
his
breath
was
stifled
by
inquietudes
his
blood
was
chilled
and
his
stomach
was
bereaved
of
its
usual
energies
a
temporary
indisposition
was
produced
in
many
some
were
haunted
by
a
melancholy
bordering
upon
madness
and
some
in
consequence
of
sleepless
panics
for
which
no
cause
could
be
assigned
and
for
which
no
opiates
could
be
found
were
attacked
by
lingering
or
mortal
diseases
mr
hadwin
was
superior
to
groundless
apprehensions
his
daughters
however
partook
in
all
the
consternation
which
surrounded
them
the
eldest
had
indeed
abundant
reason
for
her
terror
the
youth
to
whom
she
was
betrothed
resided
in
the
city
a
year
previous
to
this
he
had
left
the
house
of
mr
hadwin
who
was
his
uncle
and
had
removed
to
philadelphia
in
pursuit
of
fortune
he
made
himself
clerk
to
a
merchant
and
by
some
mercantile
adventures
in
which
he
had
successfully
engaged
began
to
flatter
himself
with
being
able
in
no
long
time
to
support
a
family
meanwhile
a
tender
and
constant
correspondence
was
maintained
between
him
and
his
beloved
susan
this
girl
was
a
soft
enthusiast
in
whose
bosom
devotion
and
love
glowed
with
an
ardour
that
has
seldom
been
exceeded
the
first
tidings
of
the
yellow
fever
was
heard
by
her
with
unspeakable
perturbation
wallace
was
interrogated
by
letter
respecting
its
truth
for
a
time
he
treated
it
as
a
vague
report
at
length
a
confession
was
extorted
from
him
that
there
existed
a
pestilential
disease
in
the
city
but
he
added
that
it
was
hitherto
confined
to
one
quarter
distant
from
the
place
of
his
abode
the
most
pathetic
entreaties
were
urged
by
her
that
he
would
withdraw
into
the
country
he
declared
his
resolution
to
comply
when
the
street
in
which
he
lived
should
become
infected
and
his
stay
should
be
attended
with
real
danger
he
stated
how
much
his
interests
depended
upon
the
favour
of
his
present
employer
who
had
used
the
most
powerful
arguments
to
detain
him
but
declared
that
when
his
situation
should
become
in
the
least
degree
perilous
he
would
slight
every
consideration
of
gratitude
and
interest
and
fly
to
malverton
meanwhile
he
promised
to
communicate
tidings
of
his
safety
by
every
opportunity
belding
mr
hadwin's
next
neighbour
though
not
uninfected
by
the
general
panic
persisted
to
visit
the
city
daily
with
his
market-cart
he
set
out
by
sunrise
and
usually
returned
by
noon
by
him
a
letter
was
punctually
received
by
susan
as
the
hour
of
belding's
return
approached
her
impatience
and
anxiety
increased
the
daily
epistle
was
received
and
read
in
a
transport
of
eagerness
for
a
while
her
emotion
subsided
but
returned
with
augmented
vehemence
at
noon
on
the
ensuing
day
these
agitations
were
too
vehement
for
a
feeble
constitution
like
hers
she
renewed
her
supplications
to
wallace
to
quit
the
city
he
repeated
his
assertions
of
being
hitherto
secure
and
his
promise
of
coming
when
the
danger
should
be
imminent
when
belding
returned
and
instead
of
being
accompanied
by
wallace
merely
brought
a
letter
from
him
the
unhappy
susan
would
sink
into
fits
of
lamentation
and
weeping
and
repel
every
effort
to
console
her
with
an
obstinacy
that
partook
of
madness
it
was
at
length
manifest
that
wallace's
delays
would
be
fatally
injurious
to
the
health
of
his
mistress
mr
hadwin
had
hitherto
been
passive
he
conceived
that
the
entreaties
and
remonstrances
of
his
daughter
were
more
likely
to
influence
the
conduct
of
wallace
than
any
representations
which
he
could
make
now
however
he
wrote
the
contumacious
wallace
a
letter
in
which
he
laid
his
commands
upon
him
to
return
in
company
with
belding
and
declared
that
by
a
longer
delay
the
youth
would
forfeit
his
favour
the
malady
had
at
this
time
made
considerable
progress
belding's
interest
at
length
yielded
to
his
fears
and
this
was
the
last
journey
which
he
proposed
to
make
hence
our
impatience
for
the
return
of
wallace
was
augmented
since
if
this
opportunity
were
lost
no
suitable
conveyance
might
again
be
offered
him
belding
set
out
as
usual
at
the
dawn
of
day
the
customary
interval
between
his
departure
and
return
was
spent
by
susan
in
a
tumult
of
hopes
and
fears
as
noon
approached
her
suspense
arose
to
a
pitch
of
wildness
and
agony
she
could
scarcely
be
restrained
from
running
along
the
road
many
miles
towards
the
city
that
she
might
by
meeting
belding
half-way
the
sooner
ascertain
the
fate
of
her
lover
she
stationed
herself
at
a
window
which
overlooked
the
road
along
which
belding
was
to
pass
her
sister
and
her
father
though
less
impatient
marked
with
painful
eagerness
the
first
sound
of
the
approaching
vehicle
they
snatched
a
look
at
it
as
soon
as
it
appeared
in
sight
belding
was
without
a
companion
this
confirmation
of
her
fears
overwhelmed
the
unhappy
susan
she
sunk
into
a
fit
from
which
for
a
long
time
her
recovery
was
hopeless
this
was
succeeded
by
paroxysms
of
a
furious
insanity
in
which
she
attempted
to
snatch
any
pointed
implement
which
lay
within
her
reach
with
a
view
to
destroy
herself
these
being
carefully
removed
or
forcibly
wrested
from
her
she
resigned
herself
to
sobs
and
exclamations
having
interrogated
belding
he
informed
us
that
he
occupied
his
usual
post
in
the
market-place
that
heretofore
wallace
had
duly
sought
him
out
and
exchanged
letters
but
that
on
this
morning
the
young
man
had
not
made
his
appearance
though
belding
had
been
induced
by
his
wish
to
see
him
to
prolong
his
stay
in
the
city
much
beyond
the
usual
period
that
some
other
cause
than
sickness
had
occasioned
this
omission
was
barely
possible
there
was
scarcely
room
for
the
most
sanguine
temper
to
indulge
a
hope
wallace
was
without
kindred
and
probably
without
friends
in
the
city
the
merchant
in
whose
service
he
had
placed
himself
was
connected
with
him
by
no
considerations
but
that
of
interest
what
then
must
be
his
situation
when
seized
with
a
malady
which
all
believed
to
be
contagious
and
the
fear
of
which
was
able
to
dissolve
the
strongest
ties
that
bind
human
beings
together
i
was
personally
a
stranger
to
this
youth
i
had
seen
his
letters
and
they
bespoke
not
indeed
any
great
refinement
or
elevation
of
intelligence
but
a
frank
and
generous
spirit
to
which
i
could
not
refuse
my
esteem
but
his
chief
claim
to
my
affection
consisted
in
his
consanguinity
to
mr
hadwin
and
his
place
in
the
affections
of
susan
his
welfare
was
essential
to
the
happiness
of
those
whose
happiness
had
become
essential
to
mine
i
witnessed
the
outrages
of
despair
in
the
daughter
and
the
symptoms
of
a
deep
but
less
violent
grief
in
the
sister
and
parent
was
it
not
possible
for
me
to
alleviate
their
pangs
could
not
the
fate
of
wallace
be
ascertained
this
disease
assailed
men
with
different
degrees
of
malignity
in
its
worst
form
perhaps
it
was
incurable
but
in
some
of
its
modes
it
was
doubtless
conquerable
by
the
skill
of
physicians
and
the
fidelity
of
nurses
in
its
least
formidable
symptoms
negligence
and
solitude
would
render
it
fatal
wallace
might
perhaps
experience
this
pest
in
its
most
lenient
degree
but
the
desertion
of
all
mankind
the
want
not
only
of
medicines
but
of
food
would
irrevocably
seal
his
doom
my
imagination
was
incessantly
pursued
by
the
image
of
this
youth
perishing
alone
and
in
obscurity
calling
on
the
name
of
distant
friends
or
invoking
ineffectually
the
succour
of
those
who
were
near
hitherto
distress
had
been
contemplated
at
a
distance
and
through
the
medium
of
a
fancy
delighting
to
be
startled
by
the
wonderful
or
transported
by
sublimity
now
the
calamity
had
entered
my
own
doors
imaginary
evils
were
supplanted
by
real
and
my
heart
was
the
seat
of
commiseration
and
horror
i
found
myself
unfit
for
recreation
or
employment
i
shrouded
myself
in
the
gloom
of
the
neighbouring
forest
or
lost
myself
in
the
maze
of
rocks
and
dells
i
endeavoured
in
vain
to
shut
out
the
phantoms
of
the
dying
wallace
and
to
forget
the
spectacle
of
domestic
woes
at
length
it
occurred
to
me
to
ask
may
not
this
evil
be
obviated
and
the
felicity
of
the
hadwins
re-established
wallace
is
friendless
and
succourless
but
cannot
i
supply
to
him
the
place
of
protector
and
nurse
why
not
hasten
to
the
city
search
out
his
abode
and
ascertain
whether
he
be
living
or
dead
if
he
still
retain
life
may
i
not
by
consolation
and
attendance
contribute
to
the
restoration
of
his
health
and
conduct
him
once
more
to
the
bosom
of
his
family
with
what
transports
will
his
arrival
be
hailed
how
amply
will
their
impatience
and
their
sorrow
be
compensated
by
his
return
in
the
spectacle
of
their
joys
how
rapturous
and
pure
will
be
my
delight
do
the
benefits
which
i
have
received
from
the
hadwins
demand
a
less
retribution
than
this
it
is
true
that
my
own
life
will
be
endangered
but
my
danger
will
be
proportioned
to
the
duration
of
my
stay
in
this
seat
of
infection
the
death
or
the
flight
of
wallace
may
absolve
me
from
the
necessity
of
spending
one
night
in
the
city
the
rustics
who
daily
frequent
the
market
are
as
experience
proves
exempt
from
this
disease
in
consequence
perhaps
of
limiting
their
continuance
in
the
city
to
a
few
hours
may
i
not
in
this
respect
conform
to
their
example
and
enjoy
a
similar
exemption
my
stay
however
may
be
longer
than
the
day
i
may
be
condemned
to
share
in
the
common
destiny
what
then
life
is
dependent
on
a
thousand
contingencies
not
to
be
computed
or
foreseen
the
seeds
of
an
early
and
lingering
death
are
sown
in
my
constitution
it
is
in
vain
to
hope
to
escape
the
malady
by
which
my
mother
and
my
brothers
have
died
we
are
a
race
whose
existence
some
inherent
property
has
limited
to
the
short
space
of
twenty
years
we
are
exposed
in
common
with
the
rest
of
mankind
to
innumerable
casualties
but
if
these
be
shunned
we
are
unalterably
fated
to
perish
by
consumption
why
then
should
i
scruple
to
lay
down
my
life
in
the
cause
of
virtue
and
humanity
it
is
better
to
die
in
the
consciousness
of
having
offered
an
heroic
sacrifice
to
die
by
a
speedy
stroke
than
by
the
perverseness
of
nature
in
ignominious
inactivity
and
lingering
agonies
these
considerations
determined
me
to
hasten
to
the
city
to
mention
my
purpose
to
the
hadwins
would
be
useless
or
pernicious
it
would
only
augment
the
sum
of
their
present
anxieties
i
should
meet
with
a
thousand
obstacles
in
the
tenderness
and
terror
of
eliza
and
in
the
prudent
affection
of
her
father
their
arguments
i
should
be
condemned
to
hear
but
should
not
be
able
to
confute
and
should
only
load
myself
with
imputations
of
perverseness
and
temerity
but
how
else
should
i
explain
my
absence
i
had
hitherto
preserved
my
lips
untainted
by
prevarication
or
falsehood
perhaps
there
was
no
occasion
which
would
justify
an
untruth
but
here
at
least
it
was
superfluous
or
hurtful
my
disappearance
if
effected
without
notice
or
warning
will
give
birth
to
speculation
and
conjecture
but
my
true
motives
will
never
be
suspected
and
therefore
will
excite
no
fears
my
conduct
will
not
be
charged
with
guilt
it
will
merely
be
thought
upon
with
some
regret
which
will
be
alleviated
by
the
opinion
of
my
safety
and
the
daily
expectation
of
my
return
but
since
my
purpose
was
to
search
out
wallace
i
must
be
previously
furnished
with
directions
to
the
place
of
his
abode
and
a
description
of
his
person
satisfaction
on
this
head
was
easily
obtained
from
mr
hadwin
who
was
prevented
from
suspecting
the
motives
of
my
curiosity
by
my
questions
being
put
in
a
manner
apparently
casual
he
mentioned
the
street
and
the
number
of
the
house
i
listened
with
surprise
it
was
a
house
with
which
i
was
already
familiar
he
resided
it
seems
with
a
merchant
was
it
possible
for
me
to
be
mistaken
what
i
asked
was
the
merchant's
name
thetford
this
was
a
confirmation
of
my
first
conjecture
i
recollected
the
extraordinary
means
by
which
i
had
gained
access
to
the
house
and
bedchamber
of
this
gentleman
i
recalled
the
person
and
appearance
of
the
youth
by
whose
artifices
i
had
been
entangled
in
the
snare
these
artifices
implied
some
domestic
or
confidential
connection
between
thetford
and
my
guide
wallace
was
a
member
of
the
family
could
it
be
he
by
whom
i
was
betrayed
suitable
questions
easily
obtained
from
hadwin
a
description
of
the
person
and
carriage
of
his
nephew
every
circumstance
evinced
the
identity
of
their
persons
wallace
then
was
the
engaging
and
sprightly
youth
whom
i
had
encountered
at
lesher's
and
who
for
purposes
not
hitherto
discoverable
had
led
me
into
a
situation
so
romantic
and
perilous
i
was
far
from
suspecting
that
these
purposes
were
criminal
it
was
easy
to
infer
that
his
conduct
proceeded
from
juvenile
wantonness
and
a
love
of
sport
my
resolution
was
unaltered
by
this
disclosure
and
having
obtained
all
the
information
which
i
needed
i
secretly
began
my
journey
my
reflections
on
the
way
were
sufficiently
employed
in
tracing
the
consequences
of
my
project
in
computing
the
inconveniences
and
dangers
to
which
i
was
preparing
to
subject
myself
in
fortifying
my
courage
against
the
influence
of
rueful
sights
and
abrupt
transitions
and
in
imagining
the
measures
which
it
would
be
proper
to
pursue
in
every
emergency
connected
as
these
views
were
with
the
family
and
character
of
thetford
i
could
not
but
sometimes
advert
to
those
incidents
which
formerly
happened
the
mercantile
alliance
between
him
and
welbeck
was
remembered
the
allusions
which
were
made
to
the
condition
of
the
latter
in
the
chamber-conversation
of
which
i
was
an
unsuspected
auditor
and
the
relation
which
these
allusions
might
possess
with
subsequent
occurrences
welbeck's
property
was
forfeited
it
had
been
confided
to
the
care
of
thetford's
brother
had
the
cause
of
this
forfeiture
been
truly
or
thoroughly
explained
might
not
contraband
articles
have
been
admitted
through
the
management
or
under
the
connivance
of
the
brothers
and
might
not
the
younger
thetford
be
furnished
with
the
means
of
purchasing
the
captured
vessel
and
her
cargo--which
as
usual
would
be
sold
by
auction
at
a
fifth
or
tenth
of
its
real
value
welbeck
was
not
alive
to
profit
by
the
detection
of
this
artifice
admitting
these
conclusions
to
be
just
my
knowledge
will
be
useless
to
the
world
for
by
what
motives
can
i
be
influenced
to
publish
the
truth
or
by
whom
will
my
single
testimony
be
believed
in
opposition
to
that
plausible
exterior
and
perhaps
to
that
general
integrity
which
thetford
has
maintained
to
myself
it
will
not
be
unprofitable
it
is
a
lesson
on
the
principles
of
human
nature
on
the
delusiveness
of
appearances
on
the
perviousness
of
fraud
and
on
the
power
with
which
nature
has
invested
human
beings
over
the
thoughts
and
actions
of
each
other
thetford
and
his
frauds
were
dismissed
from
my
thoughts
to
give
place
to
considerations
relative
to
clemenza
lodi
and
the
money
which
chance
had
thrown
into
my
possession
time
had
only
confirmed
my
purpose
to
restore
these
bills
to
the
rightful
proprietor
and
heightened
my
impatience
to
discover
her
retreat
i
reflected
that
the
means
of
doing
this
were
more
likely
to
suggest
themselves
at
the
place
to
which
i
was
going
than
elsewhere
i
might
indeed
perish
before
my
views
in
this
respect
could
be
accomplished
against
these
evils
i
had
at
present
no
power
to
provide
while
i
lived
i
would
bear
perpetually
about
me
the
volume
and
its
precious
contents
if
i
died
a
superior
power
must
direct
the
course
of
this
as
of
all
other
events
these
meditations
did
not
enfeeble
my
resolution
or
slacken
my
pace
in
proportion
as
i
drew
near
the
city
the
tokens
of
its
calamitous
condition
became
more
apparent
every
farm-house
was
filled
with
supernumerary
tenants
fugitives
from
home
and
haunting
the
skirts
of
the
road
eager
to
detain
every
passenger
with
inquiries
after
news
the
passengers
were
numerous
for
the
tide
of
emigration
was
by
no
means
exhausted
some
were
on
foot
bearing
in
their
countenances
the
tokens
of
their
recent
terror
and
filled
with
mournful
reflections
on
the
forlornness
of
their
state
few
had
secured
to
themselves
an
asylum
some
were
without
the
means
of
paying
for
victuals
or
lodging
for
the
coming
night
others
who
were
not
thus
destitute
yet
knew
not
whither
to
apply
for
entertainment
every
house
being
already
overstocked
with
inhabitants
or
barring
its
inhospitable
doors
at
their
approach
families
of
weeping
mothers
and
dismayed
children
attended
with
a
few
pieces
of
indispensable
furniture
were
carried
in
vehicles
of
every
form
the
parent
or
husband
had
perished
and
the
price
of
some
movable
or
the
pittance
handed
forth
by
public
charity
had
been
expended
to
purchase
the
means
of
retiring
from
this
theatre
of
disasters
though
uncertain
and
hopeless
of
accommodation
in
the
neighbouring
districts
between
these
and
the
fugitives
whom
curiosity
had
led
to
the
road
dialogues
frequently
took
place
to
which
i
was
suffered
to
listen
from
every
mouth
the
tale
of
sorrow
was
repeated
with
new
aggravations
pictures
of
their
own
distress
or
of
that
of
their
neighbours
were
exhibited
in
all
the
hues
which
imagination
can
annex
to
pestilence
and
poverty
my
preconceptions
of
the
evil
now
appeared
to
have
fallen
short
of
the
truth
the
dangers
into
which
i
was
rushing
seemed
more
numerous
and
imminent
than
i
had
previously
imagined
i
wavered
not
in
my
purpose
a
panic
crept
to
my
heart
which
more
vehement
exertions
were
necessary
to
subdue
or
control
but
i
harboured
not
a
momentary
doubt
that
the
course
which
i
had
taken
was
prescribed
by
duty
there
was
no
difficulty
or
reluctance
in
proceeding
all
for
which
my
efforts
were
demanded
was
to
walk
in
this
path
without
tumult
or
alarm
various
circumstances
had
hindered
me
from
setting
out
upon
this
journey
as
early
as
was
proper
my
frequent
pauses
to
listen
to
the
narratives
of
travellers
contributed
likewise
to
procrastination
the
sun
had
nearly
set
before
i
reached
the
precincts
of
the
city
i
pursued
the
track
which
i
had
formerly
taken
and
entered
high
street
after
nightfall
instead
of
equipages
and
a
throng
of
passengers
the
voice
of
levity
and
glee
which
i
had
formerly
observed
and
which
the
mildness
of
the
season
would
at
other
times
have
produced
i
found
nothing
but
a
dreary
solitude
the
market-place
and
each
side
of
this
magnificent
avenue
were
illuminated
as
before
by
lamps
but
between
the
verge
of
schuylkill
and
the
heart
of
the
city
i
met
not
more
than
a
dozen
figures
and
these
were
ghost-like
wrapped
in
cloaks
from
behind
which
they
cast
upon
me
glances
of
wonder
and
suspicion
and
as
i
approached
changed
their
course
to
avoid
touching
me
their
clothes
were
sprinkled
with
vinegar
and
their
nostrils
defended
from
contagion
by
some
powerful
perfume
i
cast
a
look
upon
the
houses
which
i
recollected
to
have
formerly
been
at
this
hour
brilliant
with
lights
resounding
with
lively
voices
and
thronged
with
busy
faces
now
they
were
closed
above
and
below
dark
and
without
tokens
of
being
inhabited
from
the
upper
windows
of
some
a
gleam
sometimes
fell
upon
the
pavement
i
was
traversing
and
showed
that
their
tenants
had
not
fled
but
were
secluded
or
disabled
these
tokens
were
new
and
awakened
all
my
panics
death
seemed
to
hover
over
this
scene
and
i
dreaded
that
the
floating
pestilence
had
already
lighted
on
my
frame
i
had
scarcely
overcome
these
tremors
when
i
approached
a
house
the
door
of
which
was
opened
and
before
which
stood
a
vehicle
which
i
presently
recognised
to
be
a
hearse
the
driver
was
seated
on
it
i
stood
still
to
mark
his
visage
and
to
observe
the
course
which
he
proposed
to
take
presently
a
coffin
borne
by
two
men
issued
from
the
house
the
driver
was
a
negro
but
his
companions
were
white
their
features
were
marked
by
ferocious
indifference
to
danger
or
pity
one
of
them
as
he
assisted
in
thrusting
the
coffin
into
the
cavity
provided
for
it
said
i'll
be
damned
if
i
think
the
poor
dog
was
quite
dead
it
wasn't
the
fever
that
ailed
him
but
the
sight
of
the
girl
and
her
mother
on
the
floor
i
wonder
how
they
all
got
into
that
room
what
carried
them
there
the
other
surlily
muttered
their
legs
to-be-sure
but
what
should
they
hug
together
in
one
room
for
to
save
us
trouble
to-be-sure
and
i
thank
them
with
all
my
heart
but
damn
it
it
wasn't
right
to
put
him
in
his
coffin
before
the
breath
was
fairly
gone
i
thought
the
last
look
he
gave
me
told
me
to
stay
a
few
minutes
pshaw
he
could
not
live
the
sooner
dead
the
better
for
him
as
well
as
for
us
did
you
mark
how
he
eyed
us
when
we
carried
away
his
wife
and
daughter
i
never
cried
in
my
life
since
i
was
knee-high
but
curse
me
if
i
ever
felt
in
better
tune
for
the
business
than
just
then
hey
continued
he
looking
up
and
observing
me
standing
a
few
paces
distant
and
listening
to
their
discourse
what's
wanted
anybody
dead
i
stayed
not
to
answer
or
parley
but
hurried
forward
my
joints
trembled
and
cold
drops
stood
on
my
forehead
i
was
ashamed
of
my
own
infirmity
and
by
vigorous
efforts
of
my
reason
regained
some
degree
of
composure
the
evening
had
now
advanced
and
it
behooved
me
to
procure
accommodation
at
some
of
the
inns
these
were
easily
distinguished
by
their
signs
but
many
were
without
inhabitants
at
length
i
lighted
upon
one
the
hall
of
which
was
open
and
the
windows
lifted
after
knocking
for
some
time
a
young
girl
appeared
with
many
marks
of
distress
in
answer
to
my
question
she
answered
that
both
her
parents
were
sick
and
that
they
could
receive
no
one
i
inquired
in
vain
for
any
other
tavern
at
which
strangers
might
be
accommodated
she
knew
of
none
such
and
left
me
on
someone's
calling
to
her
from
above
in
the
midst
of
my
embarrassment
after
a
moment's
pause
i
returned
discomfited
and
perplexed
to
the
street
i
proceeded
in
a
considerable
degree
at
random
at
length
i
reached
a
spacious
building
in
fourth
street
which
the
signpost
showed
me
to
be
an
inn
i
knocked
loudly
and
often
at
the
door
at
length
a
female
opened
the
window
of
the
second
story
and
in
a
tone
of
peevishness
demanded
what
i
wanted
i
told
her
that
i
wanted
lodging
go
hunt
for
it
somewhere
else
said
she
you'll
find
none
here
i
began
to
expostulate
but
she
shut
the
window
with
quickness
and
left
me
to
my
own
reflections
i
began
now
to
feel
some
regret
at
the
journey
i
had
taken
never
in
the
depth
of
caverns
or
forests
was
i
equally
conscious
of
loneliness
i
was
surrounded
by
the
habitations
of
men
but
i
was
destitute
of
associate
or
friend
i
had
money
but
a
horse-shelter
or
a
morsel
of
food
could
not
be
purchased
i
came
for
the
purpose
of
relieving
others
but
stood
in
the
utmost
need
myself
even
in
health
my
condition
was
helpless
and
forlorn
but
what
would
become
of
me
should
this
fatal
malady
be
contracted
to
hope
that
an
asylum
would
be
afforded
to
a
sick
man
which
was
denied
to
one
in
health
was
unreasonable
the
first
impulse
which
flowed
from
these
reflections
was
to
hasten
back
to
malverton
which
with
sufficient
diligence
i
might
hope
to
regain
before
the
morning
light
i
could
not
methought
return
upon
my
steps
with
too
much
speed
i
was
prompted
to
run
as
if
the
pest
was
rushing
upon
me
and
could
be
eluded
only
by
the
most
precipitate
flight
this
impulse
was
quickly
counteracted
by
new
ideas
i
thought
with
indignation
and
shame
on
the
imbecility
of
my
proceeding
i
called
up
the
images
of
susan
hadwin
and
of
wallace
i
reviewed
the
motives
which
had
led
me
to
the
undertaking
of
this
journey
time
had
by
no
means
diminished
their
force
i
had
indeed
nearly
arrived
at
the
accomplishment
of
what
i
had
intended
a
few
steps
would
carry
me
to
thetford's
habitation
this
might
be
the
critical
moment
when
succour
was
most
needed
and
would
be
most
efficacious
i
had
previously
concluded
to
defer
going
thither
till
the
ensuing
morning
but
why
should
i
allow
myself
a
moment's
delay
i
might
at
least
gain
an
external
view
of
the
house
and
circumstances
might
arise
which
would
absolve
me
from
the
obligation
of
remaining
an
hour
longer
in
the
city
all
for
which
i
came
might
be
performed
the
destiny
of
wallace
be
ascertained
and
i
be
once
more
safe
within
the
precincts
of
malverton
before
the
return
of
day
i
immediately
directed
my
steps
towards
the
habitation
of
thetford
carriages
bearing
the
dead
were
frequently
discovered
a
few
passengers
likewise
occurred
whose
hasty
and
perturbed
steps
denoted
their
participation
in
the
common
distress
the
house
of
which
i
was
in
quest
quickly
appeared
light
from
an
upper
window
indicated
that
it
was
still
inhabited
i
paused
a
moment
to
reflect
in
what
manner
it
became
me
to
proceed
to
ascertain
the
existence
and
condition
of
wallace
was
the
purpose
of
my
journey
he
had
inhabited
this
house
and
whether
he
remained
in
it
was
now
to
be
known
i
felt
repugnance
to
enter
since
my
safety
might
by
entering
be
unawares
and
uselessly
endangered
most
of
the
neighbouring
houses
were
apparently
deserted
in
some
there
were
various
tokens
of
people
being
within
might
i
not
inquire
at
one
of
these
respecting
the
condition
of
thetford's
family
yet
why
should
i
disturb
them
by
inquiries
so
impertinent
at
this
unseasonable
hour
to
knock
at
thetford's
door
and
put
my
questions
to
him
who
should
obey
the
signal
was
the
obvious
method
i
knocked
dubiously
and
lightly
no
one
came
i
knocked
again
and
more
loudly
i
likewise
drew
the
bell
i
distinctly
heard
its
distant
peals
if
any
were
within
my
signal
could
not
fail
to
be
noticed
i
paused
and
listened
but
neither
voice
nor
footsteps
could
be
heard
the
light
though
obscured
by
window-curtains
which
seemed
to
be
drawn
close
was
still
perceptible
i
ruminated
on
the
causes
that
might
hinder
my
summons
from
being
obeyed
i
figured
to
myself
nothing
but
the
helplessness
of
disease
or
the
insensibility
of
death
these
images
only
urged
me
to
persist
in
endeavouring
to
obtain
admission
without
weighing
the
consequences
of
my
act
i
involuntarily
lifted
the
latch
the
door
yielded
to
my
hand
and
i
put
my
feet
within
the
passage
once
more
i
paused
the
passage
was
of
considerable
extent
and
at
the
end
of
it
i
perceived
light
as
from
a
lamp
or
candle
this
impelled
me
to
go
forward
till
i
reached
the
foot
of
a
staircase
a
candle
stood
upon
the
lowest
step
this
was
a
new
proof
that
the
house
was
not
deserted
i
struck
my
heel
against
the
floor
with
some
violence
but
this
like
my
former
signals
was
unnoticed
having
proceeded
thus
far
it
would
have
been
absurd
to
retire
with
my
purpose
uneffected
taking
the
candle
in
my
hand
i
opened
a
door
that
was
near
it
led
into
a
spacious
parlour
furnished
with
profusion
and
splendour
i
walked
to
and
fro
gazing
at
the
objects
which
presented
themselves
and
involved
in
perplexity
i
knocked
with
my
heel
louder
than
ever
but
no
less
ineffectually
notwithstanding
the
lights
which
i
had
seen
it
was
possible
that
the
house
was
uninhabited
this
i
was
resolved
to
ascertain
by
proceeding
to
the
chamber
which
i
had
observed
from
without
to
be
illuminated
this
chamber
as
far
as
the
comparison
of
circumstances
would
permit
me
to
decide
i
believed
to
be
the
same
in
which
i
had
passed
the
first
night
of
my
late
abode
in
the
city
now
was
i
a
second
time
in
almost
equal
ignorance
of
my
situation
and
of
the
consequences
which
impended
exploring
my
way
to
the
same
recess
i
mounted
the
stair
as
i
approached
the
door
of
which
i
was
in
search
a
vapour
infectious
and
deadly
assailed
my
senses
it
resembled
nothing
of
which
i
had
ever
before
been
sensible
many
odours
had
been
met
with
even
since
my
arrival
in
the
city
less
supportable
than
this
i
seemed
not
so
much
to
smell
as
to
taste
the
element
that
now
encompassed
me
i
felt
as
if
i
had
inhaled
a
poisonous
and
subtle
fluid
whose
power
instantly
bereft
my
stomach
of
all
vigour
some
fatal
influence
appeared
to
seize
upon
my
vitals
and
the
work
of
corrosion
and
decomposition
to
be
busily
begun
for
a
moment
i
doubted
whether
imagination
had
not
some
share
in
producing
my
sensation
but
i
had
not
been
previously
panic-struck
and
even
now
i
attended
to
my
own
sensations
without
mental
discomposure
that
i
had
imbibed
this
disease
was
not
to
be
questioned
so
far
the
chances
in
my
favour
were
annihilated
the
lot
of
sickness
was
drawn
whether
my
case
would
be
lenient
or
malignant
whether
i
should
recover
or
perish
was
to
be
left
to
the
decision
of
the
future
this
incident
instead
of
appalling
me
tended
rather
to
invigorate
my
courage
the
danger
which
i
feared
had
come
i
might
enter
with
indifference
on
this
theatre
of
pestilence
i
might
execute
without
faltering
the
duties
that
my
circumstances
might
create
my
state
was
no
longer
hazardous
and
my
destiny
would
be
totally
uninfluenced
by
my
future
conduct
the
pang
with
which
i
was
first
seized
and
the
momentary
inclination
to
vomit
which
it
produced
presently
subsided
my
wholesome
feelings
indeed
did
not
revisit
me
but
strength
to
proceed
was
restored
to
me
the
effluvia
became
more
sensible
as
i
approached
the
door
of
the
chamber
the
door
was
ajar
and
the
light
within
was
perceived
my
belief
that
those
within
were
dead
was
presently
confuted
by
sound
which
i
first
supposed
to
be
that
of
steps
moving
quickly
and
timorously
across
the
floor
this
ceased
and
was
succeeded
by
sounds
of
different
but
inexplicable
import
having
entered
the
apartment
i
saw
a
candle
on
the
hearth
a
table
was
covered
with
vials
and
other
apparatus
of
a
sick-chamber
a
bed
stood
on
one
side
the
curtain
of
which
was
dropped
at
the
foot
so
as
to
conceal
any
one
within
i
fixed
my
eyes
upon
this
object
there
were
sufficient
tokens
that
some
one
lay
upon
the
bed
breath
drawn
at
long
intervals
mutterings
scarcely
audible
and
a
tremulous
motion
in
the
bedstead
were
fearful
and
intelligible
indications
if
my
heart
faltered
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
my
trepidations
arose
from
any
selfish
considerations
wallace
only
the
object
of
my
search
was
present
to
my
fancy
pervaded
with
remembrance
of
the
hadwins
of
the
agonies
which
they
had
already
endured
of
the
despair
which
would
overwhelm
the
unhappy
susan
when
the
death
of
her
lover
should
be
ascertained
observant
of
the
lonely
condition
of
this
house
whence
i
could
only
infer
that
the
sick
had
been
denied
suitable
attendance
and
reminded
by
the
symptoms
that
appeared
that
this
being
was
struggling
with
the
agonies
of
death
a
sickness
of
the
heart
more
insupportable
than
that
which
i
had
just
experienced
stole
upon
me
my
fancy
readily
depicted
the
progress
and
completion
of
this
tragedy
wallace
was
the
first
of
the
family
on
whom
the
pestilence
had
seized
thetford
had
fled
from
his
habitation
perhaps
as
a
father
and
husband
to
shun
the
danger
attending
his
stay
was
the
injunction
of
his
duty
it
was
questionless
the
conduct
which
selfish
regards
would
dictate
wallace
was
left
to
perish
alone
or
perhaps
which
indeed
was
a
supposition
somewhat
justified
by
appearances
he
had
been
left
to
the
tendance
of
mercenary
wretches
by
whom
at
this
desperate
moment
he
had
been
abandoned
i
was
not
mindless
of
the
possibility
that
these
forebodings
specious
as
they
were
might
be
false
the
dying
person
might
be
some
other
than
wallace
the
whispers
of
my
hope
were
indeed
faint
but
they
at
least
prompted
me
to
snatch
a
look
at
the
expiring
man
for
this
purpose
i
advanced
and
thrust
my
head
within
the
curtain
the
features
of
one
whom
i
had
seen
so
transiently
as
wallace
may
be
imagined
to
be
not
easily
recognised
especially
when
those
features
were
tremulous
and
deathful
here
however
the
differences
were
too
conspicuous
to
mislead
me
i
beheld
one
in
whom
i
could
recollect
none
that
bore
resemblance
though
ghastly
and
livid
the
traces
of
intelligence
and
beauty
were
undefaced
the
life
of
wallace
was
of
more
value
to
a
feeble
individual
but
surely
the
being
that
was
stretched
before
me
and
who
was
hastening
to
his
last
breath
was
precious
to
thousands
was
he
not
one
in
whose
place
i
would
willingly
have
died
the
offering
was
too
late
his
extremities
were
already
cold
a
vapour
noisome
and
contagious
hovered
over
him
the
flutterings
of
his
pulse
had
ceased
his
existence
was
about
to
close
amidst
convulsion
and
pangs
i
withdrew
my
gaze
from
this
object
and
walked
to
a
table
i
was
nearly
unconscious
of
my
movements
my
thoughts
were
occupied
with
contemplations
of
the
train
of
horrors
and
disasters
that
pursue
the
race
of
man
my
musings
were
quickly
interrupted
by
the
sight
of
a
small
cabinet
the
hinges
of
which
were
broken
and
the
lid
half
raised
in
the
present
state
of
my
thoughts
i
was
prone
to
suspect
the
worst
here
were
traces
of
pillage
some
casual
or
mercenary
attendant
had
not
only
contributed
to
hasten
the
death
of
the
patient
but
had
rifled
his
property
and
fled
this
suspicion
would
perhaps
have
yielded
to
mature
reflections
if
i
had
been
suffered
to
reflect
a
moment
scarcely
elapsed
when
some
appearance
in
the
mirror
which
hung
over
the
table
called
my
attention
it
was
a
human
figure
nothing
could
be
briefer
than
the
glance
that
i
fixed
upon
this
apparition
yet
there
was
room
enough
for
the
vague
conception
to
suggest
itself
that
the
dying
man
had
started
from
his
bed
and
was
approaching
me
this
belief
was
at
the
same
instant
confuted
by
the
survey
of
his
form
and
garb
one
eye
a
scar
upon
his
cheek
a
tawny
skin
a
form
grotesquely
misproportioned
brawny
as
hercules
and
habited
in
livery
composed
as
it
were
the
parts
of
one
view
to
perceive
to
fear
and
to
confront
this
apparition
were
blended
into
one
sentiment
i
turned
towards
him
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
but
my
speed
was
useless
to
my
safety
a
blow
upon
my
temple
was
succeeded
by
an
utter
oblivion
of
thought
and
of
feeling
i
sunk
upon
the
floor
prostrate
and
senseless
my
insensibility
might
be
mistaken
by
observers
for
death
yet
some
part
of
this
interval
was
haunted
by
a
fearful
dream
i
conceived
myself
lying
on
the
brink
of
a
pit
whose
bottom
the
eye
could
not
reach
my
hands
and
legs
were
fettered
so
as
to
disable
me
from
resisting
two
grim
and
gigantic
figures
who
stooped
to
lift
me
from
the
earth
their
purpose
methought
was
to
cast
me
into
this
abyss
my
terrors
were
unspeakable
and
i
struggled
with
such
force
that
my
bonds
snapped
and
i
found
myself
at
liberty
at
this
moment
my
senses
returned
and
i
opened
my
eyes
the
memory
of
recent
events
was
for
a
time
effaced
by
my
visionary
horrors
i
was
conscious
of
transition
from
one
state
of
being
to
another
but
my
imagination
was
still
filled
with
images
of
danger
the
bottomless
gulf
and
my
gigantic
persecutors
were
still
dreaded
i
looked
up
with
eagerness
beside
me
i
discovered
three
figures
whose
character
or
office
was
explained
by
a
coffin
of
pine
boards
which
lay
upon
the
floor
one
stood
with
hammer
and
nails
in
his
hand
as
ready
to
replace
and
fasten
the
lid
of
the
coffin
as
soon
as
its
burden
should
be
received
i
attempted
to
rise
from
the
floor
but
my
head
was
dizzy
and
my
sight
confused
perceiving
me
revive
one
of
the
men
assisted
me
to
regain
my
feet
the
mist
and
confusion
presently
vanished
so
as
to
allow
me
to
stand
unsupported
and
to
move
i
once
more
gazed
at
my
attendants
and
recognised
the
three
men
whom
i
had
met
in
high
street
and
whose
conversation
i
have
mentioned
that
i
overheard
i
looked
again
upon
the
coffin
a
wavering
recollection
of
the
incidents
that
led
me
hither
and
of
the
stunning
blow
which
i
had
received
occurred
to
me
i
saw
into
what
error
appearances
had
misled
these
men
and
shuddered
to
reflect
by
what
hairbreadth
means
i
had
escaped
being
buried
alive
before
the
men
had
time
to
interrogate
me
or
to
comment
upon
my
situation
one
entered
the
apartment
whose
habit
and
mien
tended
to
encourage
me
the
stranger
was
characterized
by
an
aspect
full
of
composure
and
benignity
a
face
in
which
the
serious
lines
of
age
were
blended
with
the
ruddiness
and
smoothness
of
youth
and
a
garb
that
bespoke
that
religious
profession
with
whose
benevolent
doctrines
the
example
of
hadwin
had
rendered
me
familiar
on
observing
me
on
my
feet
he
betrayed
marks
of
surprise
and
satisfaction
he
addressed
me
in
a
tone
of
mildness--
young
man
said
he
what
is
thy
condition
art
thou
sick
if
thou
art
thou
must
consent
to
receive
the
best
treatment
which
the
times
will
afford
these
men
will
convey
thee
to
the
hospital
at
bush
hill
the
mention
of
that
contagious
and
abhorred
receptacle
inspired
me
with
some
degree
of
energy
no
said
i
i
am
not
sick
a
violent
blow
reduced
me
to
this
situation
i
shall
presently
recover
strength
enough
to
leave
this
spot
without
assistance
he
looked
at
me
with
an
incredulous
but
compassionate
air--i
fear
thou
dost
deceive
thyself
or
me
the
necessity
of
going
to
the
hospital
is
much
to
be
regretted
but
on
the
whole
it
is
best
perhaps
indeed
thou
hast
kindred
or
friends
who
will
take
care
of
thee
no
said
i
neither
kindred
nor
friends
i
am
a
stranger
in
the
city
i
do
not
even
know
a
single
being
alas
returned
the
stranger
with
a
sigh
thy
state
is
sorrowful
but
how
camest
thou
hither
continued
he
looking
around
him
and
whence
comest
thou
i
came
from
the
country
i
reached
the
city
a
few
hours
ago
i
was
in
search
of
a
friend
who
lived
in
this
house
thy
undertaking
was
strangely
hazardous
and
rash
but
who
is
the
friend
thou
seekest
was
it
he
who
died
in
that
bed
and
whose
corpse
has
just
been
removed
the
men
now
betrayed
some
impatience
and
inquired
of
the
last
comer
whom
they
called
mr
estwick
what
they
were
to
do
he
turned
to
me
and
asked
if
i
were
willing
to
be
conducted
to
the
hospital
i
assured
him
that
i
was
free
from
disease
and
stood
in
no
need
of
assistance
adding
that
my
feebleness
was
owing
to
a
stunning
blow
received
from
a
ruffian
on
my
temple
the
marks
of
this
blow
were
conspicuous
and
after
some
hesitation
he
dismissed
the
men
who
lifting
the
empty
coffin
on
their
shoulders
disappeared
he
now
invited
me
to
descend
into
the
parlour
for
said
he
the
air
of
this
room
is
deadly
i
feel
already
as
if
i
should
have
reason
to
repent
of
having
entered
it
he
now
inquired
into
the
cause
of
those
appearances
which
he
had
witnessed
i
explained
my
situation
as
clearly
and
succinctly
as
i
was
able
after
pondering
in
silence
on
my
story--i
see
how
it
is
said
he
the
person
whom
thou
sawest
in
the
agonies
of
death
was
a
stranger
he
was
attended
by
his
servant
and
a
hired
nurse
his
master's
death
being
certain
the
nurse
was
despatched
by
the
servant
to
procure
a
coffin
he
probably
chose
that
opportunity
to
rifle
his
master's
trunk
that
stood
upon
the
table
thy
unseasonable
entrance
interrupted
him
and
he
designed
by
the
blow
which
he
gave
thee
to
secure
his
retreat
before
the
arrival
of
a
hearse
i
know
the
man
and
the
apparition
thou
hast
so
well
described
was
his
thou
sayest
that
a
friend
of
thine
lived
in
this
house
thou
hast
come
too
late
to
be
of
service
the
whole
family
have
perished
not
one
was
suffered
to
escape
this
intelligence
was
fatal
to
my
hopes
it
required
some
efforts
to
subdue
my
rising
emotions
compassion
not
only
for
wallace
but
for
thetford
his
father
his
wife
and
his
child
caused
a
passionate
effusion
of
tears
i
was
ashamed
of
this
useless
and
childlike
sensibility
and
attempted
to
apologize
to
my
companion
the
sympathy
however
had
proved
contagious
and
the
stranger
turned
away
his
face
to
hide
his
own
tears
nay
said
he
in
answer
to
my
excuses
there
is
no
need
to
be
ashamed
of
thy
emotion
merely
to
have
known
this
family
and
to
have
witnessed
their
deplorable
fate
is
sufficient
to
melt
the
most
obdurate
heart
i
suspect
that
thou
wast
united
to
some
one
of
this
family
by
ties
of
tenderness
like
those
which
led
the
unfortunate
maravegli
hither
this
suggestion
was
attended
in
relation
to
myself
with
some
degree
of
obscurity
but
my
curiosity
was
somewhat
excited
by
the
name
that
he
had
mentioned
i
inquired
into
the
character
and
situation
of
this
person
and
particularly
respecting
his
connection
with
this
family
maravegli
answered
he
was
the
lover
of
the
eldest
daughter
and
already
betrothed
to
her
the
whole
family
consisting
of
helpless
females
had
placed
themselves
under
his
peculiar
guardianship
mary
walpole
and
her
children
enjoyed
in
him
a
husband
and
a
father
the
name
of
walpole
to
which
i
was
a
stranger
suggested
doubts
which
i
hastened
to
communicate
i
am
in
search
said
i
not
of
a
female
friend
though
not
devoid
of
interest
in
the
welfare
of
thetford
and
his
family
my
principal
concern
is
for
a
youth
by
name
wallace
he
looked
at
me
with
surprise
thetford
this
is
not
his
abode
he
changed
his
habitation
some
weeks
previous
to
the
fever
those
who
last
dwelt
under
this
roof
were
an
englishwoman
and
seven
daughters
this
detection
of
my
error
somewhat
consoled
me
it
was
still
possible
that
wallace
was
alive
and
in
safety
i
eagerly
inquired
whither
thetford
had
removed
and
whether
he
had
any
knowledge
of
his
present
condition
they
had
removed
to
no--
in
market
street
concerning
their
state
he
knew
nothing
his
acquaintance
with
thetford
was
imperfect
whether
he
had
left
the
city
or
had
remained
he
was
wholly
uninformed
it
became
me
to
ascertain
the
truth
in
these
respects
i
was
preparing
to
offer
my
parting
thanks
to
the
person
by
whom
i
had
been
so
highly
benefited
since
as
he
now
informed
me
it
was
by
his
interposition
that
i
was
hindered
from
being
enclosed
alive
in
a
coffin
he
was
dubious
of
my
true
condition
and
peremptorily
commanded
the
followers
of
the
hearse
to
desist
a
delay
of
twenty
minutes
and
some
medical
application
would
he
believed
determine
whether
my
life
was
extinguished
or
suspended
at
the
end
of
this
time
happily
my
senses
were
recovered
seeing
my
intention
to
depart
he
inquired
why
and
whither
i
was
going
having
heard
my
answer--thy
design
resumed
he
is
highly
indiscreet
and
rash
nothing
will
sooner
generate
this
fever
than
fatigue
and
anxiety
thou
hast
scarcely
recovered
from
the
blow
so
lately
received
instead
of
being
useful
to
others
this
precipitation
will
only
disable
thyself
instead
of
roaming
the
streets
and
inhaling
this
unwholesome
air
thou
hadst
better
betake
thyself
to
bed
and
try
to
obtain
some
sleep
in
the
morning
thou
wilt
be
better
qualified
to
ascertain
the
fate
of
thy
friend
and
afford
him
the
relief
which
he
shall
want
i
could
not
but
admit
the
reasonableness
of
these
remonstrances
but
where
should
a
chamber
and
bed
be
sought
it
was
not
likely
that
a
new
attempt
to
procure
accommodation
at
the
inns
would
succeed
better
than
the
former
thy
state
replied
he
is
sorrowful
i
have
no
house
to
which
i
can
lead
thee
i
divide
my
chamber
and
even
my
bed
with
another
and
my
landlady
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
admit
a
stranger
what
thou
wilt
do
i
know
not
this
house
has
no
one
to
defend
it
it
was
purchased
and
furnished
by
the
last
possessor
but
the
whole
family
including
mistress
children
and
servants
were
cut
off
in
a
single
week
perhaps
no
one
in
america
can
claim
the
property
meanwhile
plunderers
are
numerous
and
active
a
house
thus
totally
deserted
and
replenished
with
valuable
furniture
will
i
fear
become
their
prey
to-night
nothing
can
be
done
towards
rendering
it
secure
but
staying
in
it
art
thou
willing
to
remain
here
till
the
morrow
every
bed
in
the
house
has
probably
sustained
a
dead
person
it
would
not
be
proper
therefore
to
lie
in
any
one
of
them
perhaps
thou
mayest
find
some
repose
upon
this
carpet
it
is
at
least
better
than
the
harder
pavement
and
the
open
air
this
proposal
after
some
hesitation
i
embraced
he
was
preparing
to
leave
me
promising
if
life
were
spared
to
him
to
return
early
in
the
morning
my
curiosity
respecting
the
person
whose
dying
agonies
i
had
witnessed
prompted
me
to
detain
him
a
few
minutes
ah
said
he
this
perhaps
is
the
only
one
of
many
victims
to
this
pestilence
whose
loss
the
remotest
generations
may
have
reason
to
deplore
he
was
the
only
descendant
of
an
illustrious
house
of
venice
he
has
been
devoted
from
his
childhood
to
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
and
the
practice
of
virtue
he
came
hither
as
an
enlightened
observer
and
after
traversing
the
country
conversing
with
all
the
men
in
it
eminent
for
their
talents
or
their
office
and
collecting
a
fund
of
observations
whose
solidity
and
justice
have
seldom
been
paralleled
he
embarked
three
months
ago
for
europe
previously
to
his
departure
he
formed
a
tender
connection
with
the
eldest
daughter
of
this
family
the
mother
and
her
children
had
recently
arrived
from
england
so
many
faultless
women
both
mentally
and
personally
considered
it
was
not
my
fortune
to
meet
with
before
this
youth
well
deserved
to
be
adopted
into
this
family
he
proposed
to
return
with
the
utmost
expedition
to
his
native
country
and
after
the
settlement
of
his
affairs
to
hasten
back
to
america
and
ratify
his
contract
with
fanny
walpole
the
ship
in
which
he
embarked
had
scarcely
gone
twenty
leagues
to
sea
before
she
was
disabled
by
a
storm
and
obliged
to
return
to
port
he
posted
to
new
york
to
gain
a
passage
in
a
packet
shortly
to
sail
meanwhile
this
malady
prevailed
among
us
mary
walpole
pole
was
hindered
by
her
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
that
evil
which
assailed
us
and
the
counsel
of
injudicious
friends
from
taking
the
due
precautions
for
her
safety
she
hesitated
to
fly
till
flight
was
rendered
impracticable
her
death
added
to
the
helplessness
and
distraction
of
the
family
they
were
successively
seized
and
destroyed
by
the
same
pest
maravegli
was
apprized
of
their
danger
he
allowed
the
packet
to
depart
without
him
and
hastened
to
rescue
the
walpoles
from
the
perils
which
encompassed
them
he
arrived
in
this
city
time
enough
to
witness
the
interment
of
the
last
survivor
in
the
same
hour
he
was
seized
himself
by
this
disease
the
catastrophe
is
known
to
thee
i
will
now
leave
thee
to
thy
repose
sleep
is
no
less
needful
to
myself
than
to
thee
for
this
is
the
second
night
which
has
passed
without
it
saying
this
my
companion
took
his
leave
i
now
enjoyed
leisure
to
review
my
situation
i
experienced
no
inclination
to
sleep
i
lay
down
for
a
moment
but
my
comfortless
sensations
and
restless
contemplations
would
not
permit
me
to
rest
before
i
entered
this
house
i
was
tormented
with
hunger
but
my
craving
had
given
place
to
inquietude
and
loathing
i
paced
in
thoughtful
and
anxious
mood
across
the
floor
of
the
apartment
i
mused
upon
the
incidents
related
by
estwick
upon
the
exterminating
nature
of
this
pestilence
and
on
the
horrors
of
which
it
was
productive
i
compared
the
experience
of
the
last
hours
with
those
pictures
which
my
imagination
had
drawn
in
the
retirements
of
malverton
i
wondered
at
the
contrariety
that
exists
between
the
scenes
of
the
city
and
the
country
and
fostered
with
more
zeal
than
ever
the
resolution
to
avoid
those
seats
of
depravity
and
danger
concerning
my
own
destiny
however
i
entertained
no
doubt
my
new
sensations
assured
me
that
my
stomach
had
received
this
corrosive
poison
whether
i
should
die
or
live
was
easily
decided
the
sickness
which
assiduous
attendance
and
powerful
prescriptions
might
remove
would
by
negligence
and
solitude
be
rendered
fatal
but
from
whom
could
i
expect
medical
or
friendly
treatment
i
had
indeed
a
roof
over
my
head
i
should
not
perish
in
the
public
way
but
what
was
my
ground
for
hoping
to
continue
under
this
roof
my
sickness
being
suspected
i
should
be
dragged
in
a
cart
to
the
hospital
where
i
should
indeed
die
but
not
with
the
consolation
of
loneliness
and
silence
dying
groans
were
the
only
music
and
livid
corpses
were
the
only
spectacle
to
which
i
should
there
be
introduced
immured
in
these
dreary
meditations
the
night
passed
away
the
light
glancing
through
the
window
awakened
in
my
bosom
a
gleam
of
cheerfulness
contrary
to
my
expectations
my
feelings
were
not
more
distempered
notwithstanding
my
want
of
sleep
than
on
the
last
evening
this
was
a
token
that
my
state
was
far
from
being
so
desperate
as
i
suspected
it
was
possible
i
thought
that
this
was
the
worst
indisposition
to
which
i
was
liable
meanwhile
the
coming
of
estwick
was
impatiently
expected
the
sun
arose
and
the
morning
advanced
but
he
came
not
i
remembered
that
he
talked
of
having
reason
to
repent
his
visit
to
this
house
perhaps
he
likewise
was
sick
and
this
was
the
cause
of
his
delay
this
man's
kindness
had
even
my
love
if
i
had
known
the
way
to
his
dwelling
i
should
have
hastened
thither
to
inquire
into
his
condition
and
to
perform
for
him
every
office
that
humanity
might
enjoin
but
he
had
not
afforded
me
any
information
on
that
head
it
was
now
incumbent
on
me
to
seek
the
habitation
of
thetford
to
leave
this
house
accessible
to
every
passenger
appeared
to
be
imprudent
i
had
no
key
by
which
i
might
lock
the
principal
door
i
therefore
bolted
it
on
the
inside
and
passed
through
a
window
the
shutters
of
which
i
closed
though
i
could
not
fasten
after
me
this
led
me
into
a
spacious
court
at
the
end
of
which
was
a
brick
wall
over
which
i
leaped
into
the
street
this
was
the
means
by
which
i
had
formerly
escaped
from
the
same
precincts
the
streets
as
i
passed
were
desolate
and
silent
the
largest
computation
made
the
number
of
fugitives
two-thirds
of
the
whole
people
yet
judging
by
the
universal
desolation
it
seemed
as
if
the
solitude
were
nearly
absolute
that
so
many
of
the
houses
were
closed
i
was
obliged
to
ascribe
to
the
cessation
of
traffic
which
made
the
opening
of
their
windows
useless
and
the
terror
of
infection
which
made
the
inhabitants
seclude
themselves
from
the
observation
of
each
other
i
proceeded
to
search
out
the
house
to
which
estwick
had
directed
me
as
the
abode
of
thetford
what
was
my
consternation
when
i
found
it
to
be
the
same
at
the
door
of
which
the
conversation
took
place
of
which
i
had
been
an
auditor
on
the
last
evening
i
recalled
the
scene
of
which
a
rude
sketch
had
been
given
by
the
hearse-men
if
such
were
the
fate
of
the
master
of
the
family
abounding
with
money
and
friends
what
could
be
hoped
for
the
moneyless
and
friendless
wallace
the
house
appeared
to
be
vacant
and
silent
but
these
tokens
might
deceive
there
was
little
room
for
hope
but
certainty
was
wanting
and
might
perhaps
be
obtained
by
entering
the
house
in
some
of
the
upper
rooms
a
wretched
being
might
be
immured
by
whom
the
information
so
earnestly
desired
might
be
imparted
and
to
whom
my
presence
might
bring
relief
not
only
from
pestilence
but
famine
for
a
moment
i
forgot
my
own
necessitous
condition
and
reflected
not
that
abstinence
had
already
undermined
my
strength
i
proceeded
to
knock
at
the
door
that
my
signal
was
unnoticed
produced
no
surprise
the
door
was
unlocked
and
i
opened
at
this
moment
my
attention
was
attracted
by
the
opening
of
another
door
near
me
i
looked
and
perceived
a
man
issuing
forth
from
a
house
at
a
small
distance
it
now
occurred
to
me
that
the
information
which
i
sought
might
possibly
be
gained
from
one
of
thetford's
neighbours
this
person
was
aged
but
seemed
to
have
lost
neither
cheerfulness
nor
vigour
he
had
an
air
of
intrepidity
and
calmness
it
soon
appeared
that
i
was
the
object
of
his
curiosity
he
had
probably
marked
my
deportment
through
some
window
of
his
dwelling
and
had
come
forth
to
make
inquiries
into
the
motives
of
my
conduct
he
courteously
saluted
me
you
seem
said
he
to
be
in
search
of
some
one
if
i
can
afford
you
the
information
you
want
you
will
be
welcome
to
it
encouraged
by
this
address
i
mentioned
the
name
of
thetford
and
added
my
fears
that
he
had
not
escaped
the
general
calamity
it
is
true
said
he
yesterday
himself
his
wife
and
his
child
were
in
a
hopeless
condition
i
saw
them
in
the
evening
and
expected
not
to
find
them
alive
this
morning
as
soon
as
it
was
light
however
i
visited
the
house
again
but
found
it
empty
i
suppose
they
must
have
died
and
been
removed
in
the
night
though
anxious
to
ascertain
the
destiny
of
wallace
i
was
unwilling
to
put
direct
questions
i
shuddered
while
i
longed
to
know
the
truth
why
said
i
falteringly
did
he
not
seasonably
withdraw
from
the
city
surely
he
had
the
means
of
purchasing
an
asylum
in
the
country
i
can
scarcely
tell
you
he
answered
some
infatuation
appeared
to
have
seized
him
no
one
was
more
timorous
but
he
seemed
to
think
himself
safe
as
long
as
he
avoided
contact
with
infected
persons
he
was
likewise
i
believe
detained
by
a
regard
to
his
interest
his
flight
would
not
have
been
more
injurious
to
his
affairs
than
it
was
to
those
of
others
but
gain
was
in
his
eyes
the
supreme
good
he
intended
ultimately
to
withdraw
but
his
escape
to-day
gave
him
new
courage
to
encounter
the
perils
of
to-morrow
he
deferred
his
departure
from
day
to
day
till
it
ceased
to
be
practicable
his
family
said
i
was
numerous
it
consisted
of
more
than
his
wife
and
children
perhaps
these
retired
in
sufficient
season
yes
said
he
his
father
left
the
house
at
an
early
period
one
or
two
of
the
servants
likewise
forsook
him
one
girl
more
faithful
and
heroic
than
the
rest
resisted
the
remonstrances
of
her
parents
and
friends
and
resolved
to
adhere
to
him
in
every
fortune
she
was
anxious
that
the
family
should
fly
from
danger
and
would
willingly
have
fled
in
their
company
but
while
they
stayed
it
was
her
immovable
resolution
not
to
abandon
them
alas
poor
girl
she
knew
not
of
what
stuff
the
heart
of
thetford
was
made
unhappily
she
was
the
first
to
become
sick
i
question
much
whether
her
disease
was
pestilential
it
was
probably
a
slight
indisposition
which
in
a
few
days
would
have
vanished
of
itself
or
have
readily
yielded
to
suitable
treatment
thetford
was
transfixed
with
terror
instead
of
summoning
a
physician
to
ascertain
the
nature
of
her
symptoms
he
called
a
negro
and
his
cart
from
bush
hill
in
vain
the
neighbours
interceded
for
this
unhappy
victim
in
vain
she
implored
his
clemency
and
asserted
the
lightness
of
her
indisposition
she
besought
him
to
allow
her
to
send
to
her
mother
who
resided
a
few
miles
in
the
country
who
would
hasten
to
her
succour
and
relieve
him
and
his
family
from
the
danger
and
trouble
of
nursing
her
the
man
was
lunatic
with
apprehension
he
rejected
her
entreaties
though
urged
in
a
manner
that
would
have
subdued
a
heart
of
flint
the
girl
was
innocent
and
amiable
and
courageous
but
entertained
an
unconquerable
dread
of
the
hospital
finding
entreaties
ineffectual
she
exerted
all
her
strength
in
opposition
to
the
man
who
lifted
her
into
the
cart
finding
that
her
struggles
availed
nothing
she
resigned
herself
to
despair
in
going
to
the
hospital
she
believed
herself
led
to
certain
death
and
to
the
sufferance
of
every
evil
which
the
known
inhumanity
of
its
attendants
could
inflict
this
state
of
mind
added
to
exposure
to
a
noonday
sun
in
an
open
vehicle
moving
for
a
mile
over
a
rugged
pavement
was
sufficient
to
destroy
her
i
was
not
surprised
to
hear
that
she
died
the
next
day
this
proceeding
was
sufficiently
iniquitous
yet
it
was
not
the
worst
act
of
this
man
the
rank
and
education
of
the
young
woman
might
be
some
apology
for
negligence
but
his
clerk
a
youth
who
seemed
to
enjoy
his
confidence
and
to
be
treated
by
his
family
on
the
footing
of
a
brother
or
son
fell
sick
on
the
next
night
and
was
treated
in
the
same
manner
these
tidings
struck
me
to
the
heart
a
burst
of
indignation
and
sorrow
filled
my
eyes
i
could
scarcely
stifle
my
emotions
sufficiently
to
ask
of
whom
sir
do
you
speak
was
the
name
of
the
youth--his
name--was----
his
name
was
wallace
i
see
that
you
have
some
interest
in
his
fate
he
was
one
whom
i
loved
i
would
have
given
half
my
fortune
to
procure
him
accommodation
under
some
hospitable
roof
his
attack
was
violent
but
still
his
recovery
if
he
had
been
suitably
attended
was
possible
that
he
should
survive
removal
to
the
hospital
and
the
treatment
he
must
receive
when
there
was
not
to
be
hoped
the
conduct
of
thetford
was
as
absurd
as
it
was
wicked
to
imagine
the
disease
to
be
contagious
was
the
height
of
folly
to
suppose
himself
secure
merely
by
not
permitting
a
sick
man
to
remain
under
his
roof
was
no
less
stupid
but
thetford's
fears
had
subverted
his
understanding
he
did
not
listen
to
arguments
or
supplications
his
attention
was
incapable
of
straying
from
one
object
to
influence
him
by
words
was
equivalent
to
reasoning
with
the
deaf
perhaps
the
wretch
was
more
to
be
pitied
than
hated
the
victims
of
his
implacable
caution
could
scarcely
have
endured
agonies
greater
than
those
which
his
pusillanimity
inflicted
on
himself
whatever
be
the
amount
of
his
guilt
the
retribution
has
been
adequate
he
witnessed
the
death
of
his
wife
and
child
and
last
night
was
the
close
of
his
own
existence
their
sole
attendant
was
a
black
woman
whom
by
frequent
visits
i
endeavoured
with
little
success
to
make
diligent
in
the
performance
of
her
duty
such
then
was
the
catastrophe
of
wallace
the
end
for
which
i
journeyed
hither
was
accomplished
his
destiny
was
ascertained
and
all
that
remained
was
to
fulfil
the
gloomy
predictions
of
the
lovely
but
unhappy
susan
to
tell
them
all
the
truth
would
be
needlessly
to
exasperate
her
sorrow
time
aided
by
the
tenderness
and
sympathy
of
friendship
may
banish
her
despair
and
relieve
her
from
all
but
the
witcheries
of
melancholy
having
disengaged
my
mind
from
these
reflections
i
explained
to
my
companion
in
general
terms
my
reasons
for
visiting
the
city
and
my
curiosity
respecting
thetford
he
inquired
into
the
particulars
of
my
journey
and
the
time
of
my
arrival
when
informed
that
i
had
come
in
the
preceding
evening
and
had
passed
the
subsequent
hours
without
sleep
or
food
he
expressed
astonishment
and
compassion
your
undertaking
said
he
has
certainly
been
hazardous
there
is
poison
in
every
breath
which
you
draw
but
this
hazard
has
been
greatly
increased
by
abstaining
from
food
and
sleep
my
advice
is
to
hasten
back
into
the
country
but
you
must
first
take
some
repose
and
some
victuals
if
you
pass
schuylkill
before
nightfall
it
will
be
sufficient
i
mentioned
the
difficulty
of
procuring
accommodation
on
the
road
it
would
be
most
prudent
to
set
out
upon
my
journey
so
as
to
reach
malverton
at
night
as
to
food
and
sleep
they
were
not
to
be
purchased
in
this
city
true
answered
my
companion
with
quickness
they
are
not
to
be
bought
but
i
will
furnish
you
with
as
much
as
you
desire
of
both
for
nothing
that
is
my
abode
continued
he
pointing
to
the
house
which
he
had
lately
left
i
reside
with
a
widow
lady
and
her
daughter
who
took
my
counsel
and
fled
in
due
season
i
remain
to
moralize
upon
the
scene
with
only
a
faithful
black
who
makes
my
bed
prepares
my
coffee
and
bakes
my
loaf
if
i
am
sick
all
that
a
physician
can
do
i
will
do
for
myself
and
all
that
a
nurse
can
perform
i
expect
to
be
performed
by
austin
come
with
me
drink
some
coffee
rest
a
while
on
my
mattress
and
then
fly
with
my
benedictions
on
your
head
these
words
were
accompanied
by
features
disembarrassed
and
benevolent
my
temper
is
alive
to
social
impulses
and
i
accepted
his
invitation
not
so
much
because
i
wished
to
eat
or
to
sleep
but
because
i
felt
reluctance
to
part
so
soon
with
a
being
who
possessed
so
much
fortitude
and
virtue
he
was
surrounded
by
neatness
and
plenty
austin
added
dexterity
to
submissiveness
my
companion
whose
name
i
now
found
to
be
medlicote
was
prone
to
converse
and
commented
on
the
state
of
the
city
like
one
whose
reading
had
been
extensive
and
experience
large
he
combated
an
opinion
which
i
had
casually
formed
respecting
the
origin
of
this
epidemic
and
imputed
it
not
to
infected
substances
imported
from
the
east
or
west
but
to
a
morbid
constitution
of
the
atmosphere
owing
wholly
or
in
part
to
filthy
streets
airless
habitations
and
squalid
persons
as
i
talked
with
this
man
the
sense
of
danger
was
obliterated
i
felt
confidence
revive
in
my
heart
and
energy
revisit
my
stomach
though
far
from
my
wonted
health
my
sensation
grew
less
comfortless
and
i
found
myself
to
stand
in
no
need
of
repose
breakfast
being
finished
my
friend
pleaded
his
daily
engagements
as
reasons
for
leaving
me
he
counselled
me
to
strive
for
some
repose
but
i
was
conscious
of
incapacity
to
sleep
i
was
desirous
of
escaping
as
soon
as
possible
from
this
tainted
atmosphere
and
reflected
whether
any
thing
remained
to
be
done
respecting
wallace
it
now
occurred
to
me
that
this
youth
must
have
left
some
clothes
and
papers
and
perhaps
books
the
property
of
these
was
now
vested
in
the
hadwins
i
might
deem
myself
without
presumption
their
representative
or
agent
might
i
not
take
some
measures
for
obtaining
possession
or
at
least
for
the
security
of
these
articles
the
house
and
its
furniture
were
tenantless
and
unprotected
it
was
liable
to
be
ransacked
and
pillaged
by
those
desperate
ruffians
of
whom
many
were
said
to
be
hunting
for
spoil
even
at
a
time
like
this
if
these
should
overlook
this
dwelling
thetford's
unknown
successor
or
heir
might
appropriate
the
whole
numberless
accidents
might
happen
to
occasion
the
destruction
or
embezzlement
of
what
belonged
to
wallace
which
might
be
prevented
by
the
conduct
which
i
should
now
pursue
immersed
in
these
perplexities
i
remained
bewildered
and
motionless
i
was
at
length
roused
by
some
one
knocking
at
the
door
austin
obeyed
the
signal
and
instantly
returned
leading
in--mr
hadwin
i
know
not
whether
this
unlooked-for
interview
excited
on
my
part
most
grief
or
surprise
the
motive
of
his
coming
was
easily
divined
his
journey
was
on
two
accounts
superfluous
he
whom
he
sought
was
dead
the
duty
of
ascertaining
his
condition
i
had
assigned
to
myself
i
now
perceived
and
deplored
the
error
of
which
i
had
been
guilty
in
concealing
my
intended
journey
from
my
patron
ignorant
of
the
part
i
had
acted
he
had
rushed
into
the
jaws
of
this
pest
and
endangered
a
life
unspeakably
valuable
to
his
children
and
friends
i
should
doubtless
have
obtained
his
grateful
consent
to
the
project
which
i
had
conceived
but
my
wretched
policy
had
led
me
into
this
clandestine
path
secrecy
may
seldom
be
a
crime
a
virtuous
intention
may
produce
it
but
surely
it
is
always
erroneous
and
pernicious
my
friend's
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
me
was
not
inferior
to
my
own
the
causes
which
led
to
this
unexpected
interview
were
mutually
explained
to
soothe
the
agonies
of
his
child
he
consented
to
approach
the
city
and
endeavour
to
procure
intelligence
of
wallace
when
he
left
his
house
he
intended
to
stop
in
the
environs
and
hire
some
emissary
whom
an
ample
reward
might
tempt
to
enter
the
city
and
procure
the
information
which
was
needed
no
one
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
execute
so
dangerous
a
service
averse
to
return
without
performing
his
commission
he
concluded
to
examine
for
himself
thetford's
removal
to
this
street
was
known
to
him
but
being
ignorant
of
my
purpose
he
had
not
mentioned
this
circumstance
to
me
during
our
last
conversation
i
was
sensible
of
the
danger
which
hadwin
had
incurred
by
entering
the
city
perhaps
my
knowledge
of
the
inexpressible
importance
of
his
life
to
the
happiness
of
his
daughters
made
me
aggravate
his
danger
i
knew
that
the
longer
he
lingered
in
this
tainted
air
the
hazard
was
increased
a
moment's
delay
was
unnecessary
neither
wallace
nor
myself
were
capable
of
being
benefited
by
his
presence
i
mentioned
the
death
of
his
nephew
as
a
reason
for
hastening
his
departure
i
urged
him
in
the
most
vehement
terms
to
remount
his
horse
and
to
fly
i
endeavoured
to
preclude
all
inquiries
respecting
myself
or
wallace
promising
to
follow
him
immediately
and
answer
all
his
questions
at
malverton
my
importunities
were
enforced
by
his
own
fears
and
after
a
moment's
hesitation
he
rode
away
the
emotions
produced
by
this
incident
were
in
the
present
critical
state
of
my
frame
eminently
hurtful
my
morbid
indications
suddenly
returned
i
had
reason
to
ascribe
my
condition
to
my
visit
to
the
chamber
of
maravegli
but
this
and
its
consequences
to
myself
as
well
as
the
journey
of
hadwin
were
the
fruits
of
my
unhappy
secrecy
i
had
always
been
accustomed
to
perform
my
journeys
on
foot
this
on
ordinary
occasions
was
the
preferable
method
but
now
i
ought
to
have
adopted
the
easiest
and
swiftest
means
if
hadwin
had
been
acquainted
with
my
purpose
he
would
not
only
have
approved
but
would
have
allowed
me
the
use
of
a
horse
these
reflections
were
rendered
less
pungent
by
the
recollection
that
my
motives
were
benevolent
and
that
i
had
endeavoured
the
benefit
of
others
by
means
which
appeared
to
me
most
suitable
meanwhile
how
was
i
to
proceed
what
hindered
me
from
pursuing
the
footsteps
of
hadwin
with
all
the
expedition
which
my
uneasiness
of
brain
and
stomach
would
allow
i
conceived
that
to
leave
any
thing
undone
with
regard
to
wallace
would
be
absurd
his
property
might
be
put
under
the
care
of
my
new
friend
but
how
was
it
to
be
distinguished
from
the
property
of
others
it
was
probably
contained
in
trunks
which
were
designated
by
some
label
or
mark
i
was
unacquainted
with
his
chamber
but
by
passing
from
one
to
the
other
i
might
finally
discover
it
some
token
directing
my
footsteps
might
occur
though
at
present
unforeseen
actuated
by
these
considerations
i
once
more
entered
thetford's
habitation
i
regretted
that
i
had
not
procured
the
counsel
or
attendance
of
my
new
friend
but
some
engagements
the
nature
of
which
he
did
not
explain
occasioned
him
to
leave
me
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
finished
i
wandered
over
this
deserted
mansion
in
a
considerable
degree
at
random
effluvia
of
a
pestilential
nature
assailed
me
from
every
corner
in
the
front
room
of
the
second
story
i
imagined
that
i
discovered
vestiges
of
that
catastrophe
which
the
past
night
had
produced
the
bed
appeared
as
if
some
one
had
recently
been
dragged
from
it
the
sheets
were
tinged
with
yellow
and
with
that
substance
which
is
said
to
be
characteristic
of
this
disease
the
gangrenous
or
black
vomit
the
floor
exhibited
similar
stains
there
are
many
who
will
regard
my
conduct
as
the
last
refinement
of
temerity
or
of
heroism
nothing
indeed
more
perplexes
me
than
a
review
of
my
own
conduct
not
indeed
that
death
is
an
object
always
to
be
dreaded
or
that
my
motive
did
not
justify
my
actions
but
of
all
dangers
those
allied
to
pestilence
by
being
mysterious
and
unseen
are
the
most
formidable
to
disarm
them
of
their
terrors
requires
the
longest
familiarity
nurses
and
physicians
soonest
become
intrepid
or
indifferent
but
the
rest
of
mankind
recoil
from
the
scene
with
unconquerable
loathing
i
was
sustained
not
by
confidence
of
safety
and
a
belief
of
exemption
from
this
malady
or
by
the
influence
of
habit
which
inures
us
to
all
that
is
detestable
or
perilous
but
by
a
belief
that
this
was
as
eligible
an
avenue
to
death
as
any
other
and
that
life
is
a
trivial
sacrifice
in
the
cause
of
duty
i
passed
from
one
room
to
the
other
a
portmanteau
marked
with
the
initials
of
wallace's
name
at
length
attracted
my
notice
from
this
circumstance
i
inferred
that
this
apartment
had
been
occupied
by
him
the
room
was
neatly
arranged
and
appeared
as
if
no
one
had
lately
used
it
there
were
trunks
and
drawers
that
which
i
have
mentioned
was
the
only
one
that
bore
marks
of
wallace's
ownership
this
i
lifted
in
my
arms
with
a
view
to
remove
it
to
medlicote's
house
at
that
moment
methought
i
heard
a
footstep
slowly
and
lingeringly
ascending
the
stair
i
was
disconcerted
at
this
incident
the
footstep
had
in
it
a
ghost-like
solemnity
and
tardiness
this
phantom
vanished
in
a
moment
and
yielded
place
to
more
humble
conjectures
a
human
being
approached
whose
office
and
commission
were
inscrutable
that
we
were
strangers
to
each
other
was
easily
imagined
but
how
would
my
appearance
in
this
remote
chamber
and
loaded
with
another's
property
be
interpreted
did
he
enter
the
house
after
me
or
was
he
the
tenant
of
some
chamber
hitherto
unvisited
whom
my
entrance
had
awakened
from
his
trance
and
called
from
his
couch
in
the
confusion
of
my
mind
i
still
held
my
burden
uplifted
to
have
placed
it
on
the
floor
and
encountered
this
visitant
without
this
equivocal
token
about
me
was
the
obvious
proceeding
indeed
time
only
could
decide
whether
these
footsteps
tended
to
this
or
to
some
other
apartment
my
doubts
were
quickly
dispelled
the
door
opened
and
a
figure
glided
in
the
portmanteau
dropped
from
my
arms
and
my
heart's
blood
was
chilled
if
an
apparition
of
the
dead
were
possible
and
that
possibility
i
could
not
deny
this
was
such
an
apparition
a
hue
yellowish
and
livid
bones
uncovered
with
flesh
eyes
ghastly
hollow
woe-begone
and
fixed
in
an
agony
of
wonder
upon
me
and
locks
matted
and
negligent
constituted
the
image
which
i
now
beheld
my
belief
of
somewhat
preternatural
in
this
appearance
was
confirmed
by
recollection
of
resemblances
between
these
features
and
those
of
one
who
was
dead
in
this
shape
and
visage
shadowy
and
death-like
as
they
were
the
lineaments
of
wallace
of
him
who
had
misled
my
rustic
simplicity
on
my
first
visit
to
this
city
and
whose
death
i
had
conceived
to
be
incontestably
ascertained
were
forcibly
recognised
this
recognition
which
at
first
alarmed
my
superstition
speedily
led
to
more
rational
inferences
wallace
had
been
dragged
to
the
hospital
nothing
was
less
to
be
suspected
than
that
he
would
return
alive
from
that
hideous
receptacle
but
this
was
by
no
means
impossible
the
figure
that
stood
before
me
had
just
risen
from
the
bed
of
sickness
and
from
the
brink
of
the
grave
the
crisis
of
his
malady
had
passed
and
he
was
once
more
entitled
to
be
ranked
among
the
living
this
event
and
the
consequences
which
my
imagination
connected
with
it
filled
me
with
the
liveliest
joy
i
thought
not
of
his
ignorance
of
the
causes
of
my
satisfaction
of
the
doubts
to
which
the
circumstances
of
our
interview
would
give
birth
respecting
the
integrity
of
my
purpose
i
forgot
the
artifices
by
which
i
had
formerly
been
betrayed
and
the
embarrassments
which
a
meeting
with
the
victim
of
his
artifices
would
excite
in
him
i
thought
only
of
the
happiness
which
his
recovery
would
confer
upon
his
uncle
and
his
cousins
i
advanced
towards
him
with
an
air
of
congratulation
and
offered
him
my
hand
he
shrunk
back
and
exclaimed
in
a
feeble
voice
who
are
you
what
business
have
you
here
i
am
the
friend
of
wallace
if
he
will
allow
me
to
be
so
i
am
a
messenger
from
your
uncle
and
cousins
at
malverton
i
came
to
know
the
cause
of
your
silence
and
to
afford
you
any
assistance
in
my
power
he
continued
to
regard
me
with
an
air
of
suspicion
and
doubt
these
i
endeavoured
to
remove
by
explaining
the
motives
that
led
me
hither
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
seemed
to
credit
my
representations
when
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
truth
of
my
assertions
he
inquired
with
great
anxiety
and
tenderness
concerning
his
relations
and
expressed
his
hope
that
they
were
ignorant
of
what
had
befallen
him
i
could
not
encourage
his
hopes
i
regretted
my
own
precipitation
in
adopting
the
belief
of
his
death
this
belief
had
been
uttered
with
confidence
and
without
stating
my
reasons
for
embracing
it
to
mr
hadwin
these
tidings
would
be
borne
to
his
daughters
and
their
grief
would
be
exasperated
to
a
deplorable
and
perhaps
to
a
fatal
degree
there
was
but
one
method
of
repairing
or
eluding
this
mischief
intelligence
ought
to
be
conveyed
to
them
of
his
recovery
but
where
was
the
messenger
to
be
found
no
one's
attention
could
be
found
disengaged
from
his
own
concerns
those
who
were
able
or
willing
to
leave
the
city
had
sufficient
motives
for
departure
in
relation
to
themselves
if
vehicle
or
horse
were
procurable
for
money
ought
it
not
to
be
secured
for
the
use
of
wallace
himself
whose
health
required
the
easiest
and
speediest
conveyance
from
this
theatre
of
death
my
companion
was
powerless
in
mind
as
in
limbs
he
seemed
unable
to
consult
upon
the
means
of
escaping
from
the
inconveniences
by
which
he
was
surrounded
as
soon
as
sufficient
strength
was
regained
he
had
left
the
hospital
to
repair
to
malverton
was
the
measure
which
prudence
obviously
dictated
but
he
was
hopeless
of
effecting
it
the
city
was
close
at
hand
this
was
his
usual
home
and
hither
his
tottering
and
almost
involuntary
steps
conducted
him
he
listened
to
my
representations
and
counsels
and
acknowledged
their
propriety
he
put
himself
under
my
protection
and
guidance
and
promised
to
conform
implicitly
to
my
directions
his
strength
had
sufficed
to
bring
him
thus
far
but
was
now
utterly
exhausted
the
task
of
searching
for
a
carriage
and
horse
devolved
upon
me
in
effecting
this
purpose
i
was
obliged
to
rely
upon
my
own
ingenuity
and
diligence
wallace
though
so
long
a
resident
in
the
city
knew
not
to
whom
i
could
apply
or
by
whom
carriages
were
let
to
hire
my
own
reflections
taught
me
that
this
accommodation
was
most
likely
to
be
furnished
by
innkeepers
or
that
some
of
those
might
at
least
inform
me
of
the
best
measures
to
be
taken
i
resolved
to
set
out
immediately
on
this
search
meanwhile
wallace
was
persuaded
to
take
refuge
in
medlicote's
apartments
and
to
make
by
the
assistance
of
austin
the
necessary
preparation
for
his
journey
the
morning
had
now
advanced
the
rays
of
a
sultry
sun
had
a
sickening
and
enfeebling
influence
beyond
any
which
i
had
ever
experienced
the
drought
of
unusual
duration
had
bereft
the
air
and
the
earth
of
every
particle
of
moisture
the
element
which
i
breathed
appeared
to
have
stagnated
into
noxiousness
and
putrefaction
i
was
astonished
at
observing
the
enormous
diminution
of
my
strength
my
brows
were
heavy
my
intellects
benumbed
my
sinews
enfeebled
and
my
sensations
universally
unquiet
these
prognostics
were
easily
interpreted
what
i
chiefly
dreaded
was
that
they
would
disable
me
from
executing
the
task
which
i
had
undertaken
i
summoned
up
all
my
resolution
and
cherished
a
disdain
of
yielding
to
this
ignoble
destiny
i
reflected
that
the
source
of
all
energy
and
even
of
life
is
seated
in
thought
that
nothing
is
arduous
to
human
efforts
that
the
external
frame
will
seldom
languish
while
actuated
by
an
unconquerable
soul
i
fought
against
my
dreary
feelings
which
pulled
me
to
the
earth
i
quickened
my
pace
raised
my
drooping
eyelids
and
hummed
a
cheerful
and
favourite
air
for
all
that
i
accomplished
during
this
day
i
believe
myself
indebted
to
the
strenuousness
and
ardour
of
my
resolutions
i
went
from
one
tavern
to
another
one
was
deserted
in
another
the
people
were
sick
and
their
attendants
refused
to
hearken
to
my
inquiries
or
offers
at
a
third
their
horses
were
engaged
i
was
determined
to
prosecute
my
search
as
long
as
an
inn
or
a
livery-stable
remained
unexamined
and
my
strength
would
permit
to
detail
the
events
of
this
expedition
the
arguments
and
supplications
which
i
used
to
overcome
the
dictates
of
avarice
and
fear
the
fluctuation
of
my
hopes
and
my
incessant
disappointments
would
be
useless
having
exhausted
all
my
expedients
ineffectually
i
was
compelled
to
turn
my
weary
steps
once
more
to
medlicote's
lodgings
my
meditations
were
deeply
engaged
by
the
present
circumstances
of
my
situation
since
the
means
which
were
first
suggested
were
impracticable
i
endeavoured
to
investigate
others
wallace's
debility
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
perform
this
journey
on
foot
but
would
not
his
strength
and
his
resolution
suffice
to
carry
him
beyond
schuylkill
a
carriage
or
horse
though
not
to
be
obtained
in
the
city
could
without
difficulty
be
procured
in
the
country
every
farmer
had
beasts
for
burden
and
draught
one
of
these
might
be
hired
at
no
immoderate
expense
for
half
a
day
this
project
appeared
so
practicable
and
so
specious
that
i
deeply
regretted
the
time
and
the
efforts
which
had
already
been
so
fruitlessly
expended
if
my
project
however
had
been
mischievous
to
review
it
with
regret
was
only
to
prolong
and
to
multiply
its
mischiefs
i
trusted
that
time
and
strength
would
not
be
wanting
to
the
execution
of
this
new
design
on
entering
medlicote's
house
my
looks
which
in
spite
of
my
languors
were
sprightly
and
confident
flattered
wallace
with
the
belief
that
my
exertions
had
succeeded
when
acquainted
with
their
failure
he
sunk
as
quickly
into
hopelessness
my
new
expedient
was
heard
by
him
with
no
marks
of
satisfaction
it
was
impossible
he
said
to
move
from
this
spot
by
his
own
strength
all
his
powers
were
exhausted
by
his
walk
from
bush
hill
i
endeavoured
by
arguments
and
railleries
to
revive
his
courage
the
pure
air
of
the
country
would
exhilarate
him
into
new
life
he
might
stop
at
every
fifty
yards
and
rest
upon
the
green
sod
if
overtaken
by
the
night
we
would
procure
a
lodging
by
address
and
importunity
but
if
every
door
should
be
shut
against
us
we
should
at
least
enjoy
the
shelter
of
some
barn
and
might
diet
wholesomely
upon
the
new-laid
eggs
that
we
should
find
there
the
worst
treatment
we
could
meet
with
was
better
than
continuance
in
the
city
these
remonstrances
had
some
influence
and
he
at
length
consented
to
put
his
ability
to
the
test
first
however
it
was
necessary
to
invigorate
himself
by
a
few
hours'
rest
to
this
though
with
infinite
reluctance
i
consented
this
interval
allowed
him
to
reflect
upon
the
past
and
to
inquire
into
the
fate
of
thetford
and
his
family
the
intelligence
which
medlicote
had
enabled
me
to
afford
him
was
heard
with
more
satisfaction
than
regret
the
ingratitude
and
cruelty
with
which
he
had
been
treated
seemed
to
have
extinguished
every
sentiment
but
hatred
and
vengeance
i
was
willing
to
profit
by
this
interval
to
know
more
of
thetford
than
i
already
possessed
i
inquired
why
wallace
had
so
perversely
neglected
the
advice
of
his
uncle
and
cousin
and
persisted
to
brave
so
many
dangers
when
flight
was
so
easy
i
cannot
justify
my
conduct
answered
he
it
was
in
the
highest
degree
thoughtless
and
perverse
i
was
confident
and
unconcerned
as
long
as
our
neighbourhood
was
free
from
disease
and
as
long
as
i
forbore
any
communication
with
the
sick
yet
i
should
have
withdrawn
to
malverton
merely
to
gratify
my
friends
if
thetford
had
not
used
the
most
powerful
arguments
to
detain
me
he
laboured
to
extenuate
the
danger
'why
not
stay'
said
he
'as
long
as
i
and
my
family
stay
do
you
think
that
we
would
linger
here
if
the
danger
were
imminent
as
soon
as
it
becomes
so
we
will
fly
you
know
that
we
have
a
country-house
prepared
for
our
reception
when
we
go
you
shall
accompany
us
your
services
at
this
time
are
indispensable
to
my
affairs
if
you
will
not
desert
me
your
salary
next
year
shall
be
double
and
that
will
enable
you
to
marry
your
cousin
immediately
nothing
is
more
improbable
than
that
any
of
us
should
be
sick
but
if
this
should
happen
to
you
i
plight
my
honour
that
you
shall
be
carefully
and
faithfully
attended'
these
assurances
were
solemn
and
generous
to
make
susan
hadwin
my
wife
was
the
scope
of
all
my
wishes
and
labours
by
staying
i
should
hasten
this
desirable
event
and
incur
little
hazard
by
going
i
should
alienate
the
affections
of
thetford
by
whom
it
is
but
justice
to
acknowledge
that
i
had
hitherto
been
treated
with
unexampled
generosity
and
kindness
and
blast
all
the
schemes
i
had
formed
for
rising
into
wealth
my
resolution
was
by
no
means
steadfast
as
often
as
a
letter
from
malverton
arrived
i
felt
myself
disposed
to
hasten
away
but
this
inclination
was
combated
by
new
arguments
and
new
entreaties
of
thetford
in
this
state
of
suspense
the
girl
by
whom
mrs
thetford's
infant
was
nursed
fell
sick
she
was
an
excellent
creature
and
merited
better
treatment
than
she
received
like
me
she
resisted
the
persuasions
of
her
friends
but
her
motives
for
remaining
were
disinterested
and
heroic
no
sooner
did
her
indisposition
appear
than
she
was
hurried
to
the
hospital
i
saw
that
no
reliance
could
be
placed
upon
the
assurances
of
thetford
every
consideration
gave
way
to
his
fear
of
death
after
the
girl's
departure
though
he
knew
that
she
was
led
by
his
means
to
execution
yet
he
consoled
himself
by
repeating
and
believing
her
assertions
that
her
disease
was
not
the
fever
i
was
now
greatly
alarmed
for
my
own
safety
i
was
determined
to
encounter
his
anger
and
repel
his
persuasions
and
to
depart
with
the
market-man
next
morning
that
night
however
i
was
seized
with
a
violent
fever
i
knew
in
what
manner
patients
were
treated
at
the
hospital
and
removal
thither
was
to
the
last
degree
abhorred
the
morning
arrived
and
my
situation
was
discovered
at
the
first
intimation
thetford
rushed
out
of
the
house
and
refused
to
re-enter
it
till
i
was
removed
i
knew
not
my
fate
till
three
ruffians
made
their
appearance
at
my
bedside
and
communicated
their
commission
i
called
on
the
name
of
thetford
and
his
wife
i
entreated
a
moment's
delay
till
i
had
seen
these
persons
and
endeavoured
to
procure
a
respite
from
my
sentence
they
were
deaf
to
my
entreaties
and
prepared
to
execute
their
office
by
force
i
was
delirious
with
rage
and
terror
i
heaped
the
bitterest
execrations
on
my
murderer
and
by
turns
invoked
the
compassion
of
and
poured
a
torrent
of
reproaches
on
the
wretches
whom
he
had
selected
for
his
ministers
my
struggles
and
outcries
were
vain
i
have
no
perfect
recollection
of
what
passed
till
my
arrival
at
the
hospital
my
passions
combined
with
my
disease
to
make
me
frantic
and
wild
in
a
state
like
mine
the
slightest
motion
could
not
be
endured
without
agony
what
then
must
i
have
felt
scorched
and
dazzled
by
the
sun
sustained
by
hard
boards
and
borne
for
miles
over
a
rugged
pavement
i
cannot
make
you
comprehend
the
anguish
of
my
feelings
to
be
disjointed
and
torn
piecemeal
by
the
rack
was
a
torment
inexpressibly
inferior
to
this
nothing
excites
my
wonder
but
that
i
did
not
expire
before
the
cart
had
moved
three
paces
i
knew
not
how
or
by
whom
i
was
moved
from
this
vehicle
insensibility
came
at
length
to
my
relief
after
a
time
i
opened
my
eyes
and
slowly
gained
some
knowledge
of
my
situation
i
lay
upon
a
mattress
whose
condition
proved
that
a
half-decayed
corpse
had
recently
been
dragged
from
it
the
room
was
large
but
it
was
covered
with
beds
like
my
own
between
each
there
was
scarcely
the
interval
of
three
feet
each
sustained
a
wretch
whose
groans
and
distortions
bespoke
the
desperateness
of
his
condition
the
atmosphere
was
loaded
by
mortal
stenches
a
vapour
suffocating
and
malignant
scarcely
allowed
me
to
breathe
no
suitable
receptacle
was
provided
for
the
evacuations
produced
by
medicine
or
disease
my
nearest
neighbour
was
struggling
with
death
and
my
bed
casually
extended
was
moist
with
the
detestable
matter
which
had
flowed
from
his
stomach
you
will
scarcely
believe
that
in
this
scene
of
horrors
the
sound
of
laughter
should
be
overheard
while
the
upper
rooms
of
this
building
are
filled
with
the
sick
and
the
dying
the
lower
apartments
are
the
scene
of
carousals
and
mirth
the
wretches
who
are
hired
at
enormous
wages
to
tend
the
sick
and
convey
away
the
dead
neglect
their
duty
and
consume
the
cordials
which
are
provided
for
the
patients
in
debauchery
and
riot
a
female
visage
bloated
with
malignity
and
drunkenness
occasionally
looked
in
dying
eyes
were
cast
upon
her
invoking
the
boon
perhaps
of
a
drop
of
cold
water
or
her
assistance
to
change
a
posture
which
compelled
him
to
behold
the
ghastly
writhings
or
deathful
smile
of
his
neighbour
the
visitant
had
left
the
banquet
for
a
moment
only
to
see
who
was
dead
if
she
entered
the
room
blinking
eyes
and
reeling
steps
showed
her
to
be
totally
unqualified
for
ministering
the
aid
that
was
needed
presently
she
disappeared
and
others
ascended
the
staircase
a
coffin
was
deposited
at
the
door
the
wretch
whose
heart
still
quivered
was
seized
by
rude
hands
and
dragged
along
the
floor
into
the
passage
oh
how
poor
are
the
conceptions
which
are
formed
by
the
fortunate
few
of
the
sufferings
to
which
millions
of
their
fellow-beings
are
condemned
this
misery
was
more
frightful
because
it
was
seen
to
flow
from
the
depravity
of
the
attendants
my
own
eyes
only
would
make
me
credit
the
existence
of
wickedness
so
enormous
no
wonder
that
to
die
in
garrets
and
cellars
and
stables
unvisited
and
unknown
had
by
so
many
been
preferred
to
being
brought
hither
a
physician
cast
an
eye
upon
my
state
he
gave
some
directions
to
the
person
who
attended
him
i
did
not
comprehend
them
they
were
never
executed
by
the
nurses
and
if
the
attempt
had
been
made
i
should
probably
have
refused
to
receive
what
was
offered
recovery
was
equally
beyond
my
expectations
and
my
wishes
the
scene
which
was
hourly
displayed
before
me
the
entrance
of
the
sick
most
of
whom
perished
in
a
few
hours
and
their
departure
to
the
graves
prepared
for
them
reminded
me
of
the
fate
to
which
i
also
was
reserved
three
days
passed
away
in
which
every
hour
was
expected
to
be
the
last
that
amidst
an
atmosphere
so
contagious
and
deadly
amidst
causes
of
destruction
hourly
accumulating
i
should
yet
survive
appears
to
me
nothing
less
than
miraculous
that
of
so
many
conducted
to
this
house
the
only
one
who
passed
out
of
it
alive
should
be
myself
almost
surpasses
my
belief
some
inexplicable
principle
rendered
harmless
those
potent
enemies
of
human
life
my
fever
subsided
and
vanished
my
strength
was
revived
and
the
first
use
that
i
made
of
my
limbs
was
to
bear
me
far
from
the
contemplation
and
sufferance
of
those
evils
having
gratified
my
curiosity
in
this
respect
wallace
proceeded
to
remind
me
of
the
circumstances
of
our
first
interview
he
had
entertained
doubts
whether
i
was
the
person
whom
he
had
met
at
lesher's
i
acknowledged
myself
to
be
the
same
and
inquired
in
my
turn
into
the
motives
of
his
conduct
on
that
occasion
i
confess
said
he
with
some
hesitation
i
meant
only
to
sport
with
your
simplicity
and
ignorance
you
must
not
imagine
however
that
my
stratagem
was
deep-laid
and
deliberately
executed
my
professions
at
the
tavern
were
sincere
i
meant
not
to
injure
but
to
serve
you
it
was
not
till
i
reached
the
head
of
the
staircase
that
the
mischievous
contrivance
occurred
i
foresaw
nothings
at
the
moment
but
ludicrous
mistakes
and
embarrassment
the
scheme
was
executed
almost
at
the
very
moment
it
occurred
after
i
had
returned
to
the
parlour
thetford
charged
me
with
the
delivery
of
a
message
in
a
distant
quarter
of
the
city
it
was
not
till
i
had
performed
this
commission
and
had
set
out
on
my
return
that
i
fully
revolved
the
consequences
likely
to
flow
from
my
project
that
thetford
and
his
wife
would
detect
you
in
their
bedchamber
was
unquestionable
perhaps
weary
of
my
long
delay
you
would
have
fairly
undressed
and
gone
to
bed
the
married
couple
would
have
made
preparation
to
follow
you
and
when
the
curtain
was
undrawn
would
discover
a
robust
youth
fast
asleep
in
their
place
these
images
which
had
just
before
excited
my
laughter
now
produced
a
very
different
emotion
i
dreaded
some
fatal
catastrophe
from
the
fiery
passions
of
thetford
in
the
first
transports
of
his
fury
he
might
pistol
you
or
at
least
might
command
you
to
be
dragged
to
prison
i
now
heartily
repented
of
my
jest
and
hastened
home
that
i
might
prevent
as
far
as
possible
the
evil
effects
that
might
flow
from
it
the
acknowledgment
of
my
own
agency
in
this
affair
would
at
least
transfer
thetford's
indignation
to
myself
to
whom
it
was
equitably
due
the
married
couple
had
retired
to
their
chamber
and
no
alarm
or
confusion
had
followed
this
was
an
inexplicable
circumstance
i
waited
with
impatience
till
the
morning
should
furnish
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
the
morning
arrived
a
strange
event
had
indeed
taken
place
in
their
bedchamber
they
found
an
infant
asleep
in
their
bed
thetford
had
been
roused
twice
in
the
night
once
by
a
noise
in
the
closet
and
afterwards
by
a
noise
at
the
door
some
connection
between
these
sounds
and
the
foundling
was
naturally
suspected
in
the
morning
the
closet
was
examined
and
a
coarse
pair
of
shoes
was
found
on
the
floor
the
chamber
door
which
thetford
had
locked
in
the
evening
was
discovered
to
be
open
as
likewise
a
window
in
the
kitchen
these
appearances
were
a
source
of
wonder
and
doubt
to
others
but
were
perfectly
intelligible
to
me
i
rejoiced
that
my
stratagem
had
no
more
dangerous
consequence
and
admired
the
ingenuity
and
perseverance
with
which
you
had
extricated
yourself
from
so
critical
a
state
this
narrative
was
only
the
verification
of
my
own
guesses
its
facts
were
quickly
supplanted
in
my
thoughts
by
the
disastrous
picture
he
had
drawn
of
the
state
of
the
hospital
i
was
confounded
and
shocked
by
the
magnitude
of
this
evil
the
cause
of
it
was
obvious
the
wretches
whom
money
could
purchase
were
of
course
licentious
and
unprincipled
superintended
and
controlled
they
might
be
useful
instruments
but
that
superintendence
could
not
be
bought
what
qualities
were
requisite
in
the
governor
of
such
an
institution
he
must
have
zeal
diligence
and
perseverance
he
must
act
from
lofty
and
pure
motives
he
must
be
mild
and
firm
intrepid
and
compliant
one
perfectly
qualified
for
the
office
it
is
desirable
but
not
possible
to
find
a
dispassionate
and
honest
zeal
in
the
cause
of
duty
and
humanity
may
be
of
eminent
utility
am
i
not
endowed
with
this
zeal
cannot
my
feeble
efforts
obviate
some
portion
of
this
evil
no
one
has
hitherto
claimed
this
disgustful
and
perilous
situation
my
powers
and
discernment
are
small
but
if
they
be
honestly
exerted
they
cannot
fail
to
be
somewhat
beneficial
the
impulse
produced
by
these
reflections
was
to
hasten
to
the
city
hall
and
make
known
my
wishes
this
impulse
was
controlled
by
recollections
of
my
own
indisposition
and
of
the
state
of
wallace
to
deliver
this
youth
to
his
friends
was
the
strongest
obligation
when
this
was
discharged
i
might
return
to
the
city
and
acquit
myself
of
more
comprehensive
duties
wallace
had
now
enjoyed
a
few
hours'
rest
and
was
persuaded
to
begin
the
journey
it
was
now
noonday
and
the
sun
darted
insupportable
rays
wallace
was
more
sensible
than
i
of
their
unwholesome
influence
we
had
not
reached
the
suburbs
when
his
strength
was
wholly
exhausted
and
had
i
not
supported
him
he
would
have
sunk
upon
the
pavement
my
limbs
were
scarcely
less
weak
but
my
resolutions
were
much
more
strenuous
than
his
i
made
light
of
his
indisposition
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
that
his
vigour
would
return
in
proportion
to
his
distance
from
the
city
the
moment
we
should
reach
a
shade
a
short
respite
would
restore
us
to
health
and
cheerfulness
nothing
could
revive
his
courage
or
induce
him
to
go
on
to
return
or
to
proceed
was
equally
impracticable
but
should
he
be
able
to
return
where
should
he
find
a
retreat
the
danger
of
relapse
was
imminent
his
own
chamber
at
thetford's
was
unoccupied
if
he
could
regain
this
house
might
i
not
procure
him
a
physician
and
perform
for
him
the
part
of
nurse
his
present
situation
was
critical
and
mournful
to
remain
in
the
street
exposed
to
the
malignant
fervours
of
the
sun
was
not
to
be
endured
to
carry
him
in
my
arms
exceeded
my
strength
should
i
not
claim
the
assistance
of
the
first
passenger
that
appeared
at
that
moment
a
horse
and
chaise
passed
us
the
vehicle
proceeded
at
a
quick
pace
he
that
rode
in
it
might
afford
us
the
succour
that
we
needed
he
might
be
persuaded
to
deviate
from
his
course
and
convey
the
helpless
wallace
to
the
house
we
had
just
left
this
thought
instantly
impelled
me
forward
feeble
as
i
was
i
even
ran
with
speed
in
order
to
overtake
the
vehicle
my
purpose
was
effected
with
the
utmost
difficulty
it
fortunately
happened
that
the
carriage
contained
but
one
person
who
stopped
at
my
request
his
countenance
and
guise
was
mild
and
encouraging
good
friend
i
exclaimed
here
is
a
young
man
too
indisposed
to
walk
i
want
him
carried
to
his
lodgings
will
you
for
money
or
for
charity
allow
him
a
place
in
your
chaise
and
set
him
down
where
i
shall
direct
observing
tokens
of
hesitation
i
continued
you
need
have
no
fears
to
perform
this
office
he
is
not
sick
but
merely
feeble
i
will
not
ask
twenty
minutes
and
you
may
ask
what
reward
you
think
proper
still
he
hesitated
to
comply
his
business
he
said
had
not
led
him
into
the
city
he
merely
passed
along
the
skirts
of
it
whence
he
conceived
that
no
danger
would
arise
he
was
desirous
of
helping
the
unfortunate
but
he
could
not
think
of
risking
his
own
life
in
the
cause
of
a
stranger
when
he
had
a
wife
and
children
depending
on
his
existence
and
exertions
for
bread
it
gave
him
pain
to
refuse
but
he
thought
his
duty
to
himself
and
to
others
required
that
he
should
not
hazard
his
safety
by
compliance
this
plea
was
irresistible
the
mildness
of
his
manner
showed
that
he
might
have
been
overpowered
by
persuasion
or
tempted
by
reward
i
would
not
take
advantage
of
his
tractability
but
should
have
declined
his
assistance
even
if
it
had
been
spontaneously
offered
i
turned
away
from
him
in
silence
and
prepared
to
return
to
the
spot
where
i
had
left
my
friend
the
man
prepared
to
resume
his
way
in
this
perplexity
the
thought
occurred
to
me
that
since
this
person
was
going
into
the
country
he
might
possibly
consent
to
carry
wallace
along
with
him
i
confided
greatly
in
the
salutary
influence
of
rural
airs
i
believed
that
debility
constituted
the
whole
of
his
complaint
that
continuance
in
the
city
might
occasion
his
relapse
or
at
least
procrastinate
his
restoration
i
once
more
addressed
myself
to
the
traveller
and
inquired
in
what
direction
and
how
far
he
was
going
to
my
unspeakable
satisfaction
his
answer
informed
me
that
his
home
lay
beyond
mr
hadwin's
and
that
this
road
carried
him
directly
past
that
gentleman's
door
he
was
willing
to
receive
wallace
into
his
chaise
and
to
leave
him
at
his
uncle's
this
joyous
and
auspicious
occurrence
surpassed
my
fondest
hopes
i
hurried
with
the
pleasing
tidings
to
wallace
who
eagerly
consented
to
enter
the
carriage
i
thought
not
at
the
moment
of
myself
or
how
far
the
same
means
of
escaping
from
my
danger
might
be
used
the
stranger
could
not
be
anxious
on
my
account
and
wallace's
dejection
and
weakness
may
apologize
for
his
not
soliciting
my
company
or
expressing
his
fears
for
my
safety
he
was
no
sooner
seated
than
the
traveller
hurried
away
i
gazed
after
them
motionless
and
mute
till
the
carriage
turning
a
corner
passed
beyond
my
sight
i
had
now
leisure
to
revert
to
my
own
condition
and
to
ruminate
on
that
series
of
abrupt
and
diversified
events
that
had
happened
during
the
few
hours
which
had
been
passed
in
the
city
the
end
of
my
coming
was
thus
speedily
and
satisfactorily
accomplished
my
hopes
and
fears
had
rapidly
fluctuated
but
respecting
this
young
man
had
now
subsided
into
calm
and
propitious
certainty
before
the
decline
of
the
sun
he
would
enter
his
paternal
roof
and
diffuse
ineffable
joy
throughout
that
peaceful
and
chaste
asylum
this
contemplation
though
rapturous
and
soothing
speedily
gave
way
to
reflections
on
the
conduct
which
my
duty
required
and
the
safe
departure
of
wallace
afforded
me
liberty
to
pursue
to
offer
myself
as
a
superintendent
of
the
hospital
was
still
my
purpose
the
languors
of
my
frame
might
terminate
in
sickness
but
this
event
it
was
useless
to
anticipate
the
lofty
site
and
pure
airs
of
bush
hill
might
tend
to
dissipate
my
languors
and
restore
me
to
health
at
least
while
i
had
power
i
was
bound
to
exert
it
to
the
wisest
purposes
i
resolved
to
seek
the
city
hall
immediately
and
for
that
end
crossed
the
intermediate
fields
which
separated
sassafras
from
chestnut
street
more
urgent
considerations
had
diverted
my
attention
from
the
money
which
i
bore
about
me
and
from
the
image
of
the
desolate
lady
to
whom
it
belonged
my
intentions
with
regard
to
her
were
the
same
as
ever
but
now
it
occurred
to
me
with
new
force
that
my
death
might
preclude
an
interview
between
us
and
that
it
was
prudent
to
dispose
in
some
useful
way
of
the
money
which
would
otherwise
be
left
to
the
sport
of
chance
the
evils
which
had
befallen
this
city
were
obvious
and
enormous
hunger
and
negligence
had
exasperated
the
malignity
and
facilitated
the
progress
of
the
pestilence
could
this
money
be
more
usefully
employed
than
in
alleviating
these
evils
during
my
life
i
had
no
power
over
it
but
my
death
would
justify
me
in
prescribing
the
course
which
it
should
take
how
was
this
course
to
be
pointed
out
how
might
i
place
it
so
that
i
should
effect
my
intentions
without
relinquishing
the
possession
during
my
life
these
thoughts
were
superseded
by
a
tide
of
new
sensations
the
weight
that
incommoded
my
brows
and
my
stomach
was
suddenly
increased
my
brain
was
usurped
by
some
benumbing
power
and
my
limbs
refused
to
support
me
my
pulsations
were
quickened
and
the
prevalence
of
fever
could
no
longer
be
doubted
till
now
i
had
entertained
a
faint
hope
that
my
indisposition
would
vanish
of
itself
this
hope
was
at
an
end
the
grave
was
before
me
and
my
projects
of
curiosity
or
benevolence
were
to
sink
into
oblivion
i
was
not
bereaved
of
the
powers
of
reflection
the
consequences
of
lying
in
the
road
friendless
and
unprotected
were
sure
the
first
passenger
would
notice
me
and
hasten
to
summon
one
of
those
carriages
which
are
busy
night
and
day
in
transporting
its
victims
to
the
hospital
this
fate
was
beyond
all
others
abhorrent
to
my
imagination
to
hide
me
under
some
roof
where
my
existence
would
be
unknown
and
unsuspected
and
where
i
might
perish
unmolested
and
in
quiet
was
my
present
wish
thetford's
or
medlicote's
might
afford
me
such
an
asylum
if
it
were
possible
to
reach
it
i
made
the
most
strenuous
exertions
but
they
could
not
carry
me
forward
more
than
a
hundred
paces
here
i
rested
on
steps
which
on
looking
up
i
perceived
to
belong
to
welbeck's
house
this
incident
was
unexpected
it
led
my
reflections
into
a
new
train
to
go
farther
in
the
present
condition
of
my
frame
was
impossible
i
was
well
acquainted
with
this
dwelling
all
its
avenues
were
closed
whether
it
had
remained
unoccupied
since
my
flight
from
it
i
could
not
decide
it
was
evident
that
at
present
it
was
without
inhabitants
possibly
it
might
have
continued
in
the
same
condition
in
which
welbeck
had
left
it
beds
or
sofas
might
be
found
on
which
a
sick
man
might
rest
and
be
fearless
of
intrusion
this
inference
was
quickly
overturned
by
the
obvious
supposition
that
every
avenue
was
bolted
and
locked
this
however
might
not
be
the
condition
of
the
bath-house
in
which
there
was
nothing
that
required
to
be
guarded
with
unusual
precautions
i
was
suffocated
by
inward
and
scorched
by
external
heat
and
the
relief
of
bathing
and
drinking
appeared
inestimable
the
value
of
this
prize
in
addition
to
my
desire
to
avoid
the
observation
of
passengers
made
me
exert
all
my
remnant
of
strength
repeated
efforts
at
length
enabled
me
to
mount
the
wall
and
placed
me
as
i
imagined
in
security
i
swallowed
large
draughts
of
water
as
soon
as
i
could
reach
the
well
the
effect
was
for
a
time
salutary
and
delicious
my
fervours
were
abated
and
my
faculties
relieved
from
the
weight
which
had
lately
oppressed
them
my
present
condition
was
unspeakably
more
advantageous
than
the
former
i
did
not
believe
that
it
could
be
improved
till
casting
my
eye
vaguely
over
the
building
i
happened
to
observe
the
shutters
of
a
lower
window
partly
opened
whether
this
was
occasioned
by
design
or
by
accident
there
was
no
means
of
deciding
perhaps
in
the
precipitation
of
the
latest
possessor
this
window
had
been
overlooked
perhaps
it
had
been
unclosed
by
violence
and
afforded
entrance
to
a
robber
by
what
means
soever
it
had
happened
it
undoubtedly
afforded
ingress
to
me
i
felt
no
scruple
in
profiting
by
this
circumstance
my
purposes
were
not
dishonest
i
should
not
injure
or
purloin
any
thing
it
was
laudable
to
seek
a
refuge
from
the
well-meant
persecutions
of
those
who
governed
the
city
all
i
sought
was
the
privilege
of
dying
alone
having
gotten
in
at
the
window
i
could
not
but
remark
that
the
furniture
and
its
arrangements
had
undergone
no
alteration
in
my
absence
i
moved
softly
from
one
apartment
to
another
till
at
length
i
entered
that
which
had
formerly
been
welbeck's
bedchamber
the
bed
was
naked
of
covering
the
cabinets
and
closets
exhibited
their
fastenings
broken
their
contents
were
gone
whether
these
appearances
had
been
produced
by
midnight
robbers
or
by
the
ministers
of
law
and
the
rage
of
the
creditors
of
welbeck
was
a
topic
of
fruitless
conjecture
my
design
was
now
effected
this
chamber
should
be
the
scene
of
my
disease
and
my
refuge
from
the
charitable
cruelty
of
my
neighbours
my
new
sensations
conjured
up
the
hope
that
my
indisposition
might
prove
a
temporary
evil
instead
of
pestilential
or
malignant
fever
it
might
be
a
harmless
intermittent
time
would
ascertain
its
true
nature
meanwhile
i
would
turn
the
carpet
into
a
coverlet
supply
my
pitcher
with
water
and
administer
without
sparing
and
without
fear
that
remedy
which
was
placed
within
my
reach
i
laid
myself
on
the
bed
and
wrapped
my
limbs
in
the
folds
of
the
carpet
my
thoughts
were
restless
and
perturbed
i
was
once
more
busy
in
reflecting
on
the
conduct
which
i
ought
to
pursue
with
regard
to
the
bank-bills
i
weighed
with
scrupulous
attention
every
circumstance
that
might
influence
my
decision
i
could
not
conceive
any
more
beneficial
application
of
this
property
than
to
the
service
of
the
indigent
at
this
season
of
multiplied
distress
but
i
considered
that
if
my
death
were
unknown
the
house
would
not
be
opened
or
examined
till
the
pestilence
had
ceased
and
the
benefits
of
this
application
would
thus
be
partly
or
wholly
precluded
this
season
of
disease
however
would
give
place
to
a
season
of
scarcity
the
number
and
wants
of
the
poor
during
the
ensuing
winter
would
be
deplorably
aggravated
what
multitudes
might
be
rescued
from
famine
and
nakedness
by
the
judicious
application
of
this
sum
but
how
should
i
secure
this
application
to
enclose
the
bills
in
a
letter
directed
to
some
eminent
citizen
or
public
officer
was
the
obvious
proceeding
both
of
these
conditions
were
fulfilled
in
the
person
of
the
present
chief-magistrate
to
him
therefore
the
packet
was
to
be
sent
paper
and
the
implements
of
writing
were
necessary
for
this
end
would
they
be
found
i
asked
in
the
upper
room
if
that
apartment
like
the
rest
which
i
had
seen
and
its
furniture
had
remained
untouched
my
task
would
be
practicable
but
if
the
means
of
writing
were
not
to
be
immediately
procured
my
purpose
momentous
and
dear
as
it
was
must
be
relinquished
the
truth
in
this
respect
was
easily
and
ought
immediately
to
be
ascertained
i
rose
from
the
bed
which
i
had
lately
taken
and
proceeded
to
the
study
the
entries
and
staircases
were
illuminated
by
a
pretty
strong
twilight
the
rooms
in
consequence
of
every
ray
being
excluded
by
the
closed
shutters
were
nearly
as
dark
as
if
it
had
been
midnight
the
rooms
into
which
i
had
already
passed
were
locked
but
its
key
was
in
each
lock
i
flattered
myself
that
the
entrance
into
the
study
would
be
found
in
the
same
condition
the
door
was
shut
but
no
key
was
to
be
seen
my
hopes
were
considerably
damped
by
this
appearance
but
i
conceived
it
to
be
still
possible
to
enter
since
by
chance
or
by
design
the
door
might
be
unlocked
my
fingers
touched
the
lock
when
a
sound
was
heard
as
if
a
bolt
appending
to
the
door
on
the
inside
had
been
drawn
i
was
startled
by
this
incident
it
betokened
that
the
room
was
already
occupied
by
some
other
who
desired
to
exclude
a
visitor
the
unbarred
shutter
below
was
remembered
and
associated
itself
with
this
circumstance
that
this
house
should
be
entered
by
the
same
avenue
at
the
same
time
and
this
room
should
be
sought
by
two
persons
was
a
mysterious
concurrence
i
began
to
question
whether
i
had
heard
distinctly
numberless
inexplicable
noises
are
apt
to
assail
the
ear
in
an
empty
dwelling
the
very
echoes
of
our
steps
are
unwonted
and
new
this
perhaps
was
some
such
sound
resuming
courage
i
once
more
applied
to
the
lock
the
door
in
spite
of
my
repeated
efforts
would
not
open
my
design
was
too
momentous
to
be
readily
relinquished
my
curiosity
and
my
fears
likewise
were
awakened
the
marks
of
violence
which
i
had
seen
on
the
closets
and
cabinets
below
seemed
to
indicate
the
presence
of
plunderers
here
was
one
who
laboured
for
seclusion
and
concealment
the
pillage
was
not
made
upon
my
property
my
weakness
would
disable
me
from
encountering
or
mastering
a
man
of
violence
to
solicit
admission
into
this
room
would
be
useless
to
attempt
to
force
my
way
would
be
absurd
these
reflections
prompted
me
to
withdraw
from
the
door
but
the
uncertainty
of
the
conclusions
i
had
drawn
and
the
importance
of
gaining
access
to
this
apartment
combined
to
check
my
steps
perplexed
as
to
the
means
i
should
employ
i
once
more
tried
the
lock
the
attempt
was
fruitless
as
the
former
though
hopeless
of
any
information
to
be
gained
by
that
means
i
put
my
eye
to
the
keyhole
i
discovered
a
light
different
from
what
was
usually
met
with
at
this
hour
it
was
not
the
twilight
which
the
sun
imperfectly
excluded
produces
but
gleams
as
from
a
lamp
yet
its
gleams
were
fainter
and
obscurer
than
a
lamp
generally
imparts
was
this
a
confirmation
of
my
first
conjecture
lamplight
at
noonday
in
a
mansion
thus
deserted
and
in
a
room
which
had
been
the
scene
of
memorable
and
disastrous
events
was
ominous
hitherto
no
direct
proof
had
been
given
of
the
presence
of
a
human
being
how
to
ascertain
his
presence
or
whether
it
were
eligible
by
any
means
to
ascertain
it
were
points
on
which
i
had
not
deliberated
i
had
no
power
to
deliberate
my
curiosity
impelled
me
to
call--is
there
any
one
within
speak
these
words
were
scarcely
uttered
when
some
one
exclaimed
in
a
voice
vehement
but
half-smothered
good
god--
a
deep
pause
succeeded
i
waited
for
an
answer
for
somewhat
to
which
this
emphatic
invocation
might
be
a
prelude
whether
the
tones
were
expressive
of
surprise
or
pain
or
grief
was
for
a
moment
dubious
perhaps
the
motives
which
led
me
to
this
house
suggested
the
suspicion
which
presently
succeeded
to
my
doubts--that
the
person
within
was
disabled
by
sickness
the
circumstances
of
my
own
condition
took
away
the
improbability
from
this
belief
why
might
not
another
be
induced
like
me
to
hide
himself
in
this
desolate
retreat
might
not
a
servant
left
to
take
care
of
the
house
a
measure
usually
adopted
by
the
opulent
at
this
time
be
seized
by
the
reigning
malady
incapacitated
for
exertion
or
fearing
to
be
dragged
to
the
hospital
he
has
shut
himself
in
this
apartment
the
robber
it
may
be
who
came
to
pillage
was
overtaken
and
detained
by
disease
in
either
case
detection
or
intrusion
would
be
hateful
and
would
be
assiduously
eluded
these
thoughts
had
no
tendency
to
weaken
or
divert
my
efforts
to
obtain
access
to
this
room
the
person
was
a
brother
in
calamity
whom
it
was
my
duty
to
succour
and
cherish
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
once
more
i
spoke--
who
is
within
i
beseech
you
answer
me
whatever
you
be
i
desire
to
do
you
good
and
not
injury
open
the
door
and
let
me
know
your
condition
i
will
try
to
be
of
use
to
you
i
was
answered
by
a
deep
groan
and
by
a
sob
counteracted
and
devoured
as
it
were
by
a
mighty
effort
this
token
of
distress
thrilled
to
my
heart
my
terrors
wholly
disappeared
and
gave
place
to
unlimited
compassion
i
again
entreated
to
be
admitted
promising
all
the
succour
or
consolation
which
my
situation
allowed
me
to
afford
answers
were
made
in
tones
of
anger
and
impatience
blended
with
those
of
grief--i
want
no
succour
vex
me
not
with
your
entreaties
and
offers
fly
from
this
spot
linger
not
a
moment
lest
you
participate
my
destiny
and
rush
upon
your
death
these
i
considered
merely
as
the
effusions
of
delirium
or
the
dictates
of
despair
the
style
and
articulation
denoted
the
speaker
to
be
superior
to
the
class
of
servants
hence
my
anxiety
to
see
and
to
aid
him
was
increased
my
remonstrances
were
sternly
and
pertinaciously
repelled
for
a
time
incoherent
and
impassioned
exclamations
flowed
from
him
at
length
i
was
only
permitted
to
hear
strong
aspirations
and
sobs
more
eloquent
and
more
indicative
of
grief
than
any
language
this
deportment
filled
me
with
no
less
wonder
than
commiseration
by
what
views
this
person
was
led
hither
by
what
motives
induced
to
deny
himself
to
my
entreaties
was
wholly
incomprehensible
again
though
hopeless
of
success
i
repeated
my
request
to
be
admitted
my
perseverance
seemed
now
to
have
exhausted
all
his
patience
and
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
thunder
arthur
mervyn
begone
linger
but
a
moment
and
my
rage
tiger-like
will
rush
upon
you
and
rend
you
limb
from
limb
this
address
petrified
me
the
voice
that
uttered
this
sanguinary
menace
was
strange
to
my
ears
it
suggested
no
suspicion
of
ever
having
heard
it
before
yet
my
accents
had
betrayed
me
to
him
he
was
familiar
with
my
name
notwithstanding
the
improbability
of
my
entrance
into
this
dwelling
i
was
clearly
recognized
and
unhesitatingly
named
my
curiosity
and
compassion
were
in
no
wise
diminished
but
i
found
myself
compelled
to
give
up
my
purpose
i
withdrew
reluctantly
from
the
door
and
once
more
threw
myself
upon
my
bed
nothing
was
more
necessary
in
the
present
condition
of
my
frame
than
sleep
and
sleep
had
perhaps
been
possible
if
the
scene
around
me
had
been
less
pregnant
with
causes
of
wonder
and
panic
once
more
i
tasked
memory
in
order
to
discover
in
the
persons
with
whom
i
had
hitherto
conversed
some
resemblance
in
voice
or
tones
to
him
whom
i
had
just
heard
this
process
was
effectual
gradually
my
imagination
called
up
an
image
which
now
that
it
was
clearly
seen
i
was
astonished
had
not
instantly
occurred
three
years
ago
a
man
by
name
colvill
came
on
foot
and
with
a
knapsack
on
his
back
into
the
district
where
my
father
resided
he
had
learning
and
genius
and
readily
obtained
the
station
for
which
only
he
deemed
himself
qualified
that
of
a
schoolmaster
his
demeanour
was
gentle
and
modest
his
habits
as
to
sleep
food
and
exercise
abstemious
and
regular
meditation
in
the
forest
or
reading
in
his
closet
seemed
to
constitute
together
with
attention
to
his
scholars
his
sole
amusement
and
employment
he
estranged
himself
from
company
not
because
society
afforded
no
pleasure
but
because
studious
seclusion
afforded
him
chief
satisfaction
no
one
was
more
idolized
by
his
unsuspecting
neighbours
his
scholars
revered
him
as
a
father
and
made
under
his
tuition
a
remarkable
proficiency
his
character
seemed
open
to
boundless
inspection
and
his
conduct
was
pronounced
by
all
to
be
faultless
at
the
end
of
a
year
the
scene
was
changed
a
daughter
of
one
of
his
patrons
young
artless
and
beautiful
appeared
to
have
fallen
a
prey
to
the
arts
of
some
detestable
seducer
the
betrayer
was
gradually
detected
and
successive
discoveries
showed
that
the
same
artifices
had
been
practised
with
the
same
success
upon
many
others
colvill
was
the
arch-villain
he
retired
from
the
storm
of
vengeance
that
was
gathering
over
him
and
had
not
been
heard
of
since
that
period
i
saw
him
rarely
and
for
a
short
time
and
i
was
a
mere
boy
hence
the
failure
to
recollect
his
voice
and
to
perceive
that
the
voice
of
him
immured
in
the
room
above
was
the
same
with
that
of
colvill
though
i
had
slight
reasons
for
recognising
his
features
or
accents
i
had
abundant
cause
to
think
of
him
with
detestation
and
pursue
him
with
implacable
revenge
for
the
victim
of
his
acts
she
whose
ruin
was
first
detected
was--my
sister
this
unhappy
girl
escaped
from
the
upbraidings
of
her
parents
from
the
contumelies
of
the
world
from
the
goadings
of
remorse
and
the
anguish
flowing
from
the
perfidy
and
desertion
of
colvill
in
a
voluntary
death
she
was
innocent
and
lovely
previous
to
this
evil
my
soul
was
linked
with
hers
by
a
thousand
resemblances
and
sympathies
as
well
as
by
perpetual
intercourse
from
infancy
and
by
the
fraternal
relation
she
was
my
sister
my
preceptress
and
friend
but
she
died--her
end
was
violent
untimely
and
criminal
i
cannot
think
of
her
without
heart-bursting
grief
of
her
destroyer
without
a
rancour
which
i
know
to
be
wrong
but
which
i
cannot
subdue
when
the
image
of
colvill
rushed
upon
this
occasion
on
my
thought
i
almost
started
on
my
feet
to
meet
him
after
so
long
a
separation
here
and
in
these
circumstances
was
so
unlooked-for
and
abrupt
an
event
and
revived
a
tribe
of
such
hateful
impulses
and
agonizing
recollections
that
a
total
revolution
seemed
to
have
been
effected
in
my
frame
his
recognition
of
my
person
his
aversion
to
be
seen
his
ejaculation
of
terror
and
surprise
on
first
hearing
my
voice
all
contributed
to
strengthen
my
belief
how
was
i
to
act
my
feeble
frame
could
but
ill
second
my
vengeful
purposes
but
vengeance
though
it
sometimes
occupied
my
thoughts
was
hindered
by
my
reason
from
leading
me
in
any
instance
to
outrage
or
even
to
upbraiding
all
my
wishes
with
regard
to
this
man
were
limited
to
expelling
his
image
from
my
memory
and
to
shunning
a
meeting
with
him
that
he
had
not
opened
the
door
at
my
bidding
was
now
a
topic
of
joy
to
look
upon
some
bottomless
pit
into
which
i
was
about
to
be
cast
headlong
and
alive
was
less
to
be
abhorred
than
to
look
upon
the
face
of
colvill
had
i
known
that
he
had
taken
refuge
in
this
house
no
power
should
have
compelled
me
to
enter
it
to
be
immersed
in
the
infection
of
the
hospital
and
to
be
hurried
yet
breathing
and
observant
to
my
grave
was
a
more
supportable
fate
i
dwell
with
self-condemnation
and
shame
upon
this
part
of
my
story
to
feel
extraordinary
indignation
at
vice
merely
because
we
have
partaken
in
an
extraordinary
degree
of
its
mischiefs
is
unjustifiable
to
regard
the
wicked
with
no
emotion
but
pity
to
be
active
in
reclaiming
them
in
controlling
their
malevolence
and
preventing
or
repairing
the
ills
which
they
produce
is
the
only
province
of
duty
this
lesson
as
well
as
a
thousand
others
i
have
yet
to
learn
but
i
despair
of
living
long
enough
for
that
or
any
beneficial
purpose
my
emotions
with
regard
to
colvill
were
erroneous
but
omnipotent
i
started
from
my
bed
and
prepared
to
rush
into
the
street
i
was
careless
of
the
lot
that
should
befall
me
since
no
fate
could
be
worse
than
that
of
abiding
under
the
same
roof
with
a
wretch
spotted
with
so
many
crimes
i
had
not
set
my
feet
upon
the
floor
before
my
precipitation
was
checked
by
a
sound
from
above
the
door
of
the
study
was
cautiously
and
slowly
opened
this
incident
admitted
only
of
one
construction
supposing
all
obstructions
removed
colvill
was
creeping
from
his
hiding-place
and
would
probably
fly
with
speed
from
the
house
my
belief
of
his
sickness
was
now
confuted
an
illicit
design
was
congenial
with
his
character
and
congruous
with
those
appearances
already
observed
i
had
no
power
or
wish
to
obstruct
his
flight
i
thought
of
it
with
transport
and
once
more
threw
myself
upon
the
bed
and
wrapped
my
averted
face
in
the
carpet
he
would
probably
pass
this
door
unobservant
of
me
and
my
muffled
face
would
save
me
from
the
agonies
connected
with
the
sight
of
him
the
footsteps
above
were
distinguishable
though
it
was
manifest
that
they
moved
with
lightsomeness
and
circumspection
they
reached
the
stair
and
descended
the
room
in
which
i
lay
was
like
the
rest
obscured
by
the
closed
shutters
this
obscurity
now
gave
way
to
a
light
resembling
that
glimmering
and
pale
reflection
which
i
had
noticed
in
the
study
my
eyes
though
averted
from
the
door
were
disengaged
from
the
folds
which
covered
the
rest
of
my
head
and
observed
these
tokens
of
colvill's
approach
flitting
on
the
wall
my
feverish
perturbations
increased
as
he
drew
nearer
he
reached
the
door
and
stopped
the
light
rested
for
a
moment
presently
he
entered
the
apartment
my
emotions
suddenly
rose
to
a
height
that
would
not
be
controlled
i
imagined
that
he
approached
the
bed
and
was
gazing
upon
me
at
the
same
moment
by
an
involuntary
impulse
i
threw
off
my
covering
and
turning
my
face
fixed
my
eyes
upon
my
visitant
it
was
as
i
suspected
the
figure
lifting
in
his
right
hand
a
candle
and
gazing
at
the
bed
with
lineaments
and
attitude
bespeaking
fearful
expectation
and
tormenting
doubts
was
now
beheld
one
glance
communicated
to
my
senses
all
the
parts
of
this
terrific
vision
a
sinking
at
my
heart
as
if
it
had
been
penetrated
by
a
dagger
seized
me
this
was
not
enough
i
uttered
a
shriek
too
rueful
and
loud
not
to
have
startled
the
attention
of
the
passengers
if
any
had
at
that
moment
been
passing
the
street
heaven
seemed
to
have
decreed
that
this
period
should
be
filled
with
trials
of
my
equanimity
and
fortitude
the
test
of
my
courage
was
once
more
employed
to
cover
me
with
humiliation
and
remorse
this
second
time
my
fancy
conjured
up
a
spectre
and
i
shuddered
as
if
the
grave
were
forsaken
and
the
unquiet
dead
haunted
my
pillow
the
visage
and
the
shape
had
indeed
preternatural
attitudes
but
they
belonged
not
to
colvill
but
to--welbeck
he
whom
i
had
accompanied
to
the
midst
of
the
river
whom
i
had
imagined
that
i
saw
sink
to
rise
no
more
was
now
before
me
though
incapable
of
precluding
the
groundless
belief
of
preternatural
visitations
i
was
able
to
banish
the
phantom
almost
at
the
same
instant
at
which
it
appeared
welbeck
had
escaped
from
the
stream
alive
or
had
by
some
inconceivable
means
been
restored
to
life
the
first
was
the
most
plausible
conclusion
it
instantly
engendered
a
suspicion
that
his
plunging
into
the
water
was
an
artifice
intended
to
establish
a
belief
of
his
death
his
own
tale
had
shown
him
to
be
versed
in
frauds
and
flexible
to
evil
but
was
he
not
associated
with
colvill
and
what
but
a
compact
in
iniquity
could
bind
together
such
men
while
thus
musing
welbeck's
countenance
and
gesture
displayed
emotions
too
vehement
for
speech
the
glances
that
he
fixed
upon
me
were
unsteadfast
and
wild
he
walked
along
the
floor
stopping
at
each
moment
and
darting
looks
of
eagerness
upon
me
a
conflict
of
passions
kept
him
mute
at
length
advancing
to
the
bed
on
the
side
of
which
i
was
now
sitting
he
addressed
me--
what
is
this
are
you
here
in
defiance
of
pestilence
are
you
actuated
by
some
demon
to
haunt
me
like
the
ghost
of
my
offences
and
cover
me
with
shame
what
have
i
to
do
with
that
dauntless
yet
guiltless
front
with
that
foolishly-confiding
and
obsequious
yet
erect
and
unconquerable
spirit
is
there
no
means
of
evading
your
pursuit
must
i
dip
my
hands
a
second
time
in
blood
and
dig
for
you
a
grave
by
the
side
of
watson
these
words
were
listened
to
with
calmness
i
suspected
and
pitied
the
man
but
i
did
not
fear
him
his
words
and
his
looks
were
indicative
less
of
cruelty
than
madness
i
looked
at
him
with
an
air
compassionate
and
wistful
i
spoke
with
mildness
and
composure--
mr
welbeck
you
are
unfortunate
and
criminal
would
to
god
i
could
restore
you
to
happiness
and
virtue
but
though
my
desire
be
strong
i
have
no
power
to
change
your
habits
or
rescue
you
from
misery
i
believed
you
to
be
dead
i
rejoice
to
find
myself
mistaken
while
you
live
there
is
room
to
hope
that
your
errors
will
be
cured
and
the
turmoils
and
inquietudes
that
have
hitherto
beset
your
guilty
progress
will
vanish
by
your
reverting
into
better
paths
from
me
you
have
nothing
to
fear
if
your
welfare
will
be
promoted
by
my
silence
on
the
subject
of
your
history
my
silence
shall
be
inviolate
i
deem
not
lightly
of
my
promises
they
are
given
and
shall
not
be
recalled
this
meeting
was
casual
since
i
believed
you
to
be
dead
it
could
not
be
otherwise
you
err
if
you
suppose
that
any
injury
will
accrue
to
you
from
my
life
but
you
need
not
discard
that
error
since
my
death
is
coming
i
am
not
averse
to
your
adopting
the
belief
that
the
event
is
fortunate
to
you
death
is
the
inevitable
and
universal
lot
when
or
how
it
comes
is
of
little
moment
to
stand
when
so
many
thousands
are
falling
around
me
is
not
to
be
expected
i
have
acted
an
humble
and
obscure
part
in
the
world
and
my
career
has
been
short
but
i
murmur
not
at
the
decree
that
makes
it
so
the
pestilence
is
now
upon
me
the
chances
of
recovery
are
too
slender
to
deserve
my
confidence
i
came
hither
to
die
unmolested
and
at
peace
all
i
ask
of
you
is
to
consult
your
own
safety
by
immediate
flight
and
not
to
disappoint
my
hopes
of
concealment
by
disclosing
my
condition
to
the
agents
of
the
hospital
welbeck
listened
with
the
deepest
attention
the
wildness
of
his
air
disappeared
and
gave
place
to
perplexity
and
apprehension
you
are
sick
said
he
in
a
tremulous
tone
in
which
terror
was
mingled
with
affection
you
know
this
and
expect
not
to
recover
no
mother
nor
sister
nor
friend
will
be
near
to
administer
food
or
medicine
or
comfort
yet
you
can
talk
calmly
can
be
thus
considerate
of
others--of
me
whose
guilt
has
been
so
deep
and
who
has
merited
so
little
at
your
hands
wretched
coward
thus
miserable
as
i
am
and
expect
to
be
i
cling
to
life
to
comply
with
your
heroic
counsel
and
to
fly
to
leave
you
thus
desolate
and
helpless
is
the
strongest
impulse
fain
would
i
resist
it
but
cannot
to
desert
you
would
be
flagitious
and
dastardly
beyond
all
former
acts
yet
to
stay
with
you
is
to
contract
the
disease
and
to
perish
after
you
life
burdened
as
it
is
with
guilt
and
ignominy
is
still
dear--yet
you
exhort
me
to
go
you
dispense
with
my
assistance
indeed
i
could
be
of
no
use
i
should
injure
myself
and
profit
you
nothing
i
cannot
go
into
the
city
and
procure
a
physician
or
attendant
i
must
never
more
appear
in
the
streets
of
this
city
i
must
leave
you
then
he
hurried
to
the
door
again
he
hesitated
i
renewed
my
entreaties
that
he
would
leave
me
and
encouraged
his
belief
that
his
presence
might
endanger
himself
without
conferring
the
slightest
benefit
upon
me
whither
should
i
fly
the
wide
world
contains
no
asylum
for
me
i
lived
but
on
one
condition
i
came
hither
to
find
what
would
save
me
from
ruin--from
death
i
find
it
not
it
has
vanished
some
audacious
and
fortunate
hand
has
snatched
it
from
its
place
and
now
my
ruin
is
complete
my
last
hope
is
extinct
yes
mervyn
i
will
stay
with
you
i
will
hold
your
head
i
will
put
water
to
your
lips
i
will
watch
night
and
day
by
your
side
when
you
die
i
will
carry
you
by
night
to
the
neighbouring
field
will
bury
you
and
water
your
grave
with
those
tears
that
are
due
to
your
incomparable
worth
and
untimely
destiny
then
i
will
lay
myself
in
your
bed
and
wait
for
the
same
oblivion
welbeck
seemed
now
no
longer
to
be
fluctuating
between
opposite
purposes
his
tempestuous
features
subsided
into
calm
he
put
the
candle
still
lighted
on
the
table
and
paced
the
floor
with
less
disorder
than
at
his
first
entrance
his
resolution
was
seen
to
be
the
dictate
of
despair
i
hoped
that
it
would
not
prove
invincible
to
my
remonstrances
i
was
conscious
that
his
attendance
might
preclude
in
some
degree
my
own
exertions
and
alleviate
the
pangs
of
death
but
these
consolations
might
be
purchased
too
dear
to
receive
them
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
would
be
to
make
them
odious
but
if
he
should
remain
what
conduct
would
his
companion
pursue
why
did
he
continue
in
the
study
when
welbeck
had
departed
by
what
motives
were
those
men
led
hither
i
addressed
myself
to
welbeck--
your
resolution
to
remain
is
hasty
and
rash
by
persisting
in
it
you
will
add
to
the
miseries
of
my
condition
you
will
take
away
the
only
hope
that
i
cherished
but
however
you
may
act
colvill
or
i
must
be
banished
from
this
roof
what
is
the
league
between
you
break
it
i
conjure
you
before
his
frauds
have
involved
you
in
inextricable
destruction
welbeck
looked
at
me
with
some
expression
of
doubt
i
mean
continued
i
the
man
whose
voice
i
heard
above
he
is
a
villain
and
betrayer
i
have
manifold
proofs
of
his
guilt
why
does
he
linger
behind
you
however
you
may
decide
it
is
fitting
that
he
should
vanish
alas
said
welbeck
i
have
no
companion
none
to
partake
with
me
in
good
or
evil
i
came
hither
alone
how
exclaimed
i
whom
did
i
hear
in
the
room
above
some
one
answered
my
interrogations
and
entreaties
whom
i
too
certainly
recognised
why
does
he
remain
you
heard
no
one
but
myself
the
design
that
brought
me
hither
was
to
be
accomplished
without
a
witness
i
desired
to
escape
detection
and
repelled
your
solicitations
for
admission
in
a
counterfeited
voice
that
voice
belonged
to
one
from
whom
i
had
lately
parted
what
his
merits
or
demerits
are
i
know
not
he
found
me
wandering
in
the
forests
of
new
jersey
he
took
me
to
his
home
when
seized
by
a
lingering
malady
he
nursed
me
with
fidelity
and
tenderness
when
somewhat
recovered
i
speeded
hither
but
our
ignorance
of
each
other's
character
and
views
was
mutual
and
profound
i
deemed
it
useful
to
assume
a
voice
different
from
my
own
this
was
the
last
which
i
had
heard
and
this
arbitrary
and
casual
circumstance
decided
my
choice
this
imitation
was
too
perfect
and
had
influenced
my
fears
too
strongly
to
be
easily
credited
i
suspected
welbeck
of
some
new
artifice
to
baffle
my
conclusions
and
mislead
my
judgment
this
suspicion
however
yielded
to
his
earnest
and
repeated
declarations
if
colvill
were
not
here
where
had
he
made
his
abode
how
came
friendship
and
intercourse
between
welbeck
and
him
by
what
miracle
escaped
the
former
from
the
river
into
which
i
had
imagined
him
forever
sunk
i
will
answer
you
said
he
with
candour
you
know
already
too
much
for
me
to
have
any
interest
in
concealing
any
part
of
my
life
you
have
discovered
my
existence
and
the
causes
that
rescued
me
from
destruction
may
be
told
without
detriment
to
my
person
or
fame
when
i
leaped
into
the
river
i
intended
to
perish
i
harboured
no
previous
doubts
of
my
ability
to
execute
my
fatal
purpose
in
this
respect
i
was
deceived
suffocation
would
not
come
at
my
bidding
my
muscles
and
limbs
rebelled
against
my
will
there
was
a
mechanical
repugnance
to
the
loss
of
life
which
i
could
not
vanquish
my
struggles
might
thrust
me
below
the
surface
but
my
lips
were
spontaneously
shut
and
excluded
the
torrent
from
my
lungs
when
my
breath
was
exhausted
the
efforts
that
kept
me
at
the
bottom
were
involuntarily
remitted
and
i
rose
to
the
surface
i
cursed
my
own
pusillanimity
thrice
i
plunged
to
the
bottom
and
as
often
rose
again
my
aversion
to
life
swiftly
diminished
and
at
length
i
consented
to
make
use
of
my
skill
in
swimming
which
has
seldom
been
exceeded
to
prolong
my
existence
i
landed
in
a
few
minutes
on
the
jersey
shore
this
scheme
being
frustrated
i
sunk
into
dreariness
and
inactivity
i
felt
as
if
no
dependence
could
be
placed
upon
my
courage
as
if
any
effort
i
should
make
for
self-destruction
would
be
fruitless
yet
existence
was
as
void
as
ever
of
enjoyment
and
embellishment
my
means
of
living
were
annihilated
i
saw
no
path
before
me
to
shun
the
presence
of
mankind
was
my
sovereign
wish
since
i
could
not
die
by
my
own
hands
i
must
be
content
to
crawl
upon
the
surface
till
a
superior
fate
should
permit
me
to
perish
i
wandered
into
the
centre
of
the
wood
i
stretched
myself
on
the
mossy
verge
of
a
brook
and
gazed
at
the
stars
till
they
disappeared
the
next
day
was
spent
with
little
variation
the
cravings
of
hunger
were
felt
and
the
sensation
was
a
joyous
one
since
it
afforded
me
the
practicable
means
of
death
to
refrain
from
food
was
easy
since
some
efforts
would
be
needful
to
procure
it
and
these
efforts
should
not
be
made
thus
was
the
sweet
oblivion
for
which
i
so
earnestly
panted
placed
within
my
reach
three
days
of
abstinence
and
reverie
and
solitude
succeeded
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
i
was
seated
on
a
rock
with
my
face
buried
in
my
hands
some
one
laid
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
i
started
and
looked
up
i
beheld
a
face
beaming
with
compassion
and
benignity
he
endeavoured
to
extort
from
me
the
cause
of
my
solitude
and
sorrow
i
disregarded
his
entreaties
and
was
obstinately
silent
finding
me
invincible
in
this
respect
he
invited
me
to
his
cottage
which
was
hard
by
i
repelled
him
at
first
with
impatience
and
anger
but
he
was
not
to
be
discouraged
or
intimidated
to
elude
his
persuasions
i
was
obliged
to
comply
my
strength
was
gone
and
the
vital
fabric
was
crumbling
into
pieces
a
fever
raged
in
my
veins
and
i
was
consoled
by
reflecting
that
my
life
was
at
once
assailed
by
famine
and
disease
meanwhile
my
gloomy
meditations
experienced
no
respite
i
incessantly
ruminated
on
the
events
of
my
past
life
the
long
series
of
my
crimes
arose
daily
and
afresh
to
my
imagination
the
image
of
lodi
was
recalled
his
expiring
looks
and
the
directions
which
were
mutually
given
respecting
his
sister's
and
his
property
as
i
perpetually
revolved
these
incidents
they
assumed
new
forms
and
were
linked
with
new
associations
the
volume
written
by
his
father
and
transferred
to
me
by
tokens
which
were
now
remembered
to
be
more
emphatic
than
the
nature
of
the
composition
seemed
to
justify
was
likewise
remembered
it
came
attended
by
recollections
respecting
a
volume
which
i
filled
when
a
youth
with
extracts
from
the
roman
and
greek
poets
besides
this
literary
purpose
i
likewise
used
to
preserve
in
it
the
bank-bills
with
the
keeping
or
carriage
of
which
i
chanced
to
be
entrusted
this
image
led
me
back
to
the
leather
case
containing
lodi's
property
which
was
put
into
my
hands
at
the
same
time
with
the
volume
these
images
now
gave
birth
to
a
third
conception
which
darted
on
my
benighted
understanding
like
an
electrical
flash
was
it
not
possible
that
part
of
lodi's
property
might
be
enclosed
within
the
leaves
of
this
volume
in
hastily
turning
it
over
i
recollected
to
have
noticed
leaves
whose
edges
by
accident
or
design
adhered
to
each
other
lodi
in
speaking
of
the
sale
of
his
father's
west-india
property
mentioned
that
the
sum
obtained
for
it
was
forty
thousand
dollars
half
only
of
this
sum
had
been
discovered
by
me
how
had
the
remainder
been
appropriated
surely
this
volume
contained
it
the
influence
of
this
thought
was
like
the
infusion
of
a
new
soul
into
my
frame
from
torpid
and
desperate
from
inflexible
aversion
to
medicine
and
food
i
was
changed
in
a
moment
into
vivacity
and
hope
into
ravenous
avidity
for
whatever
could
contribute
to
my
restoration
to
health
i
was
not
without
pungent
regrets
and
racking
fears
that
this
volume
would
be
ravished
away
by
creditors
or
plunderers
was
possible
every
hour
might
be
that
which
decided
my
fate
the
first
impulse
was
to
seek
my
dwelling
and
search
for
this
precious
deposit
meanwhile
my
perturbations
and
impatience
only
exasperated
my
disease
while
chained
to
my
bed
the
rumour
of
pestilence
was
spread
abroad
this
event
however
generally
calamitous
was
propitious
to
me
and
was
hailed
with
satisfaction
it
multiplied
the
chances
that
my
house
and
its
furniture
would
be
unmolested
my
friend
was
assiduous
and
indefatigable
in
his
kindness
my
deportment
before
and
subsequent
to
the
revival
of
my
hopes
was
incomprehensible
and
argued
nothing
less
than
insanity
my
thoughts
were
carefully
concealed
from
him
and
all
that
he
witnessed
was
contradictory
and
unintelligible
at
length
my
strength
was
sufficiently
restored
i
resisted
all
my
protector's
importunities
to
postpone
my
departure
till
the
perfect
confirmation
of
my
health
i
designed
to
enter
the
city
at
midnight
that
prying
eyes
might
be
eluded
to
bear
with
me
a
candle
and
the
means
of
lighting
it
to
explore
my
way
to
my
ancient
study
and
to
ascertain
my
future
claim
to
existence
and
felicity
i
crossed
the
river
this
morning
my
impatience
would
not
suffer
me
to
wait
till
evening
considering
the
desolation
of
the
city
i
thought
i
might
venture
to
approach
thus
near
without
hazard
of
detection
the
house
at
all
its
avenues
was
closed
i
stole
into
the
back
court
a
window-shutter
proved
to
be
unfastened
i
entered
and
discovered
closets
and
cabinets
unfastened
and
emptied
of
all
their
contents
at
this
spectacle
my
heart
sunk
my
books
doubtless
had
shared
the
common
destiny
my
blood
throbbed
with
painful
vehemence
as
i
approached
the
study
and
opened
the
door
my
hopes
that
languished
for
a
moment
were
revived
by
the
sight
of
my
shelves
furnished
as
formerly
i
had
lighted
my
candle
below
for
i
desired
not
to
awaken
observation
and
suspicion
by
unclosing
the
windows
my
eye
eagerly
sought
the
spot
where
i
remembered
to
have
left
the
volume
its
place
was
empty
the
object
of
all
my
hopes
had
eluded
my
grasp
and
disappeared
forever
to
paint
my
confusion
to
repeat
my
execrations
on
the
infatuation
which
had
rendered
during
so
long
a
time
that
it
was
in
my
possession
this
treasure
useless
to
me
and
my
curses
of
the
fatal
interference
which
had
snatched
away
the
prize
would
be
only
aggravations
of
my
disappointment
and
my
sorrow
you
found
me
in
this
state
and
know
what
followed
this
narrative
threw
new
light
on
the
character
of
welbeck
if
accident
had
given
him
possession
of
this
treasure
it
was
easy
to
predict
on
what
schemes
of
luxury
and
selfishness
it
would
have
been
expended
the
same
dependence
on
the
world's
erroneous
estimation
the
same
devotion
to
imposture
and
thoughtlessness
of
futurity
would
have
constituted
the
picture
of
his
future
life
as
had
distinguished
the
past
this
money
was
another's
to
retain
it
for
his
own
use
was
criminal
of
this
crime
he
appeared
to
be
as
insensible
as
ever
his
own
gratification
was
the
supreme
law
of
his
actions
to
be
subjected
to
the
necessity
of
honest
labour
was
the
heaviest
of
all
evils
and
one
from
which
he
was
willing
to
escape
by
the
commission
of
suicide
the
volume
which
he
sought
was
mine
it
was
my
duty
to
restore
it
to
the
rightful
owner
or
if
the
legal
claimant
could
not
be
found
to
employ
it
in
the
promotion
of
virtue
and
happiness
to
give
it
to
welbeck
was
to
consecrate
it
to
the
purpose
of
selfishness
and
misery
my
right
legally
considered
was
as
valid
as
his
but
if
i
intended
not
to
resign
it
to
him
was
it
proper
to
disclose
the
truth
and
explain
by
whom
the
volume
was
purloined
from
the
shelf
the
first
impulse
was
to
hide
this
truth
but
my
understanding
had
been
taught
by
recent
occurrences
to
question
the
justice
and
deny
the
usefulness
of
secrecy
in
any
case
my
principles
were
true
my
motives
were
pure
why
should
i
scruple
to
avow
my
principles
and
vindicate
my
actions
welbeck
had
ceased
to
be
dreaded
or
revered
that
awe
which
was
once
created
by
his
superiority
of
age
refinement
of
manners
and
dignity
of
garb
had
vanished
i
was
a
boy
in
years
an
indigent
and
uneducated
rustic
but
i
was
able
to
discern
the
illusions
of
power
and
riches
and
abjured
every
claim
to
esteem
that
was
not
founded
on
integrity
there
was
no
tribunal
before
which
i
should
falter
in
asserting
the
truth
and
no
species
of
martyrdom
which
i
would
not
cheerfully
embrace
in
its
cause
after
some
pause
i
said
cannot
you
conjecture
in
what
way
this
volume
has
disappeared
no
he
answered
with
a
sigh
why
of
all
his
volumes
this
only
should
have
vanished
was
an
inexplicable
enigma
perhaps
said
i
it
is
less
important
to
know
how
it
was
removed
than
by
whom
it
is
now
possessed
unquestionably
and
yet
unless
that
knowledge
enables
me
to
regain
the
possession
it
will
be
useless
useless
then
it
will
be
for
the
present
possessor
will
never
return
it
to
you
indeed
replied
he
in
a
tone
of
dejection
your
conjecture
is
most
probable
such
a
prize
is
of
too
much
value
to
be
given
up
what
i
have
said
flows
not
from
conjecture
but
from
knowledge
i
know
that
it
will
never
be
restored
to
you
at
these
words
welbeck
looked
at
me
with
anxiety
and
doubt--you
know
that
it
will
not
have
you
any
knowledge
of
the
book
can
you
tell
me
what
has
become
of
it
yes
after
our
separation
on
the
river
i
returned
to
this
house
i
found
this
volume
and
secured
it
you
rightly
suspected
its
contents
the
money
was
there
welbeck
started
as
if
he
had
trodden
on
a
mine
of
gold
his
first
emotion
was
rapturous
but
was
immediately
chastened
by
some
degree
of
doubt--what
has
become
of
it
have
you
got
it
is
it
entire
have
you
it
with
you
it
is
unimpaired
i
have
got
it
and
shall
hold
it
as
a
sacred
trust
for
the
rightful
proprietor
the
tone
with
which
this
declaration
was
accompanied
shook
the
new-born
confidence
of
welbeck
the
rightful
proprietor
true
but
i
am
he
to
me
only
it
belongs
and
to
me
you
are
doubtless
willing
to
restore
it
mr
welbeck
it
is
not
my
desire
to
give
you
perplexity
or
anguish
to
sport
with
your
passions
on
the
supposition
of
your
death
i
deemed
it
no
infraction
of
justice
to
take
this
manuscript
accident
unfolded
its
contents
i
could
not
hesitate
to
choose
my
path
the
natural
and
legal
successor
of
vincentio
lodi
is
his
sister
to
her
therefore
this
property
belongs
and
to
her
only
will
i
give
it
presumptuous
boy
and
this
is
your
sage
decision
i
tell
you
that
i
am
the
owner
and
to
me
you
shall
render
it
who
is
this
girl
childish
and
ignorant
unable
to
consult
and
to
act
for
herself
on
the
most
trivial
occasion
am
i
not
by
the
appointment
of
her
dying
brother
her
protector
and
guardian
her
age
produces
a
legal
incapacity
of
property
do
you
imagine
that
so
obvious
an
expedient
as
that
of
procuring
my
legal
appointment
as
her
guardian
was
overlooked
by
me
if
it
were
neglected
still
my
title
to
provide
her
subsistence
and
enjoyment
is
unquestionable
did
i
not
rescue
her
from
poverty
and
prostitution
and
infamy
have
i
not
supplied
all
her
wants
with
incessant
solicitude
whatever
her
condition
required
has
been
plenteously
supplied
the
dwelling
and
its
furniture
was
hers
as
far
a
rigid
jurisprudence
would
permit
to
prescribe
her
expenses
and
govern
her
family
was
the
province
of
her
guardian
you
have
heard
the
tale
of
my
anguish
and
despair
whence
did
they
flow
but
from
the
frustration
of
schemes
projected
for
her
benefit
as
they
were
executed
with
her
money
and
by
means
which
the
authority
of
her
guardian
fully
justified
why
have
i
encountered
this
contagious
atmosphere
and
explored
my
way
like
a
thief
to
this
recess
but
with
a
view
to
rescue
her
from
poverty
and
restore
to
her
her
own
your
scruples
are
ridiculous
and
criminal
i
treat
them
with
less
severity
because
your
youth
is
raw
and
your
conceptions
crude
but
if
after
this
proof
of
the
justice
of
my
claim
you
hesitate
to
restore
the
money
i
shall
treat
you
as
a
robber
who
has
plundered
my
cabinet
and
refused
to
refund
his
spoil
these
reasonings
were
powerful
and
new
i
was
acquainted
with
the
rights
of
guardianship
welbeck
had
in
some
respects
acted
as
the
friend
of
this
lady
to
vest
himself
with
this
office
was
the
conduct
which
her
youth
and
helplessness
prescribed
to
her
friend
his
title
to
this
money
as
her
guardian
could
not
be
denied
but
how
was
this
statement
compatible
with
former
representations
no
mention
had
then
been
made
of
guardianship
by
thus
acting
he
would
have
thwarted
all
his
schemes
for
winning
the
esteem
of
mankind
and
fostering
the
belief
which
the
world
entertained
of
his
opulence
and
independence
i
was
thrown
by
these
thoughts
into
considerable
perplexity
if
his
statement
were
true
his
claim
to
this
money
was
established
but
i
questioned
its
truth
to
intimate
my
doubts
of
his
veracity
would
be
to
provoke
abhorrence
and
outrage
his
last
insinuation
was
peculiarly
momentous
suppose
him
the
fraudulent
possessor
of
this
money
shall
i
be
justified
in
taking
it
away
by
violence
under
pretence
of
restoring
it
to
the
genuine
proprietor
who
for
aught
i
know
may
be
dead
or
with
whom
at
least
i
may
never
procure
a
meeting
but
will
not
my
behaviour
on
this
occasion
be
deemed
illicit
i
entered
welbeck's
habitation
at
midnight
proceeded
to
his
closet
possessed
myself
of
portable
property
and
retired
unobserved
is
not
guilt
imputable
to
an
action
like
this
welbeck
waited
with
impatience
for
a
conclusion
to
my
pause
my
perplexity
and
indecision
did
not
abate
and
my
silence
continued
at
length
he
repeated
his
demands
with
new
vehemence
i
was
compelled
to
answer
i
told
him
in
few
words
that
his
reasonings
had
not
convinced
me
of
the
equity
of
his
claim
and
that
my
determination
was
unaltered
he
had
not
expected
this
inflexibility
from
one
in
my
situation
the
folly
of
opposition
when
my
feebleness
and
loneliness
were
contrasted
with
his
activity
and
resources
appeared
to
him
monstrous
and
glaring
but
his
contempt
was
converted
into
rage
and
fear
when
he
reflected
that
this
folly
might
finally
defeat
his
hopes
he
had
probably
determined
to
obtain
the
money
let
the
purchase
cost
what
it
would
but
was
willing
to
exhaust
pacific
expedients
before
he
should
resort
to
force
he
might
likewise
question
whether
the
money
was
within
his
reach
i
had
told
him
that
i
had
it
but
whether
it
was
now
about
me
was
somewhat
dubious
yet
though
he
used
no
direct
inquiries
he
chose
to
proceed
on
the
supposition
of
its
being
at
hand
his
angry
tones
were
now
changed
into
those
of
remonstrance
and
persuasion--
your
present
behaviour
mervyn
does
not
justify
the
expectation
i
had
formed
of
you
you
have
been
guilty
of
a
base
theft
to
this
you
have
added
the
deeper
crime
of
ingratitude
but
your
infatuation
and
folly
are
at
least
as
glaring
as
your
guilt
do
you
think
i
can
credit
your
assertions
that
you
keep
this
money
for
another
when
i
recollect
that
six
weeks
have
passed
since
you
carried
it
off
why
have
you
not
sought
the
owner
and
restored
it
to
her
if
your
intentions
had
been
honest
would
you
have
suffered
so
long
a
time
to
elapse
without
doing
this
it
is
plain
that
you
designed
to
keep
it
for
your
own
use
but
whether
this
were
your
purpose
or
not
you
have
no
longer
power
to
restore
it
or
retain
it
you
say
that
you
came
hither
to
die
if
so
what
is
to
be
the
fate
of
the
money
in
your
present
situation
you
cannot
gain
access
to
the
lady
some
other
must
inherit
this
wealth
next
to
signora
lodi
whose
right
can
be
put
in
competition
with
mine
but
if
you
will
not
give
it
to
me
on
my
own
account
let
it
be
given
in
trust
for
her
let
me
be
the
bearer
of
it
to
her
own
hands
i
have
already
shown
you
that
my
claim
to
it
as
her
guardian
is
legal
and
incontrovertible
but
this
claim
i
waive
i
will
merely
be
the
executor
of
your
will
i
will
bind
myself
to
comply
with
your
directions
by
any
oath
however
solemn
and
tremendous
which
you
shall
prescribe
as
long
as
my
own
heart
acquitted
me
these
imputations
of
dishonesty
affected
me
but
little
they
excited
no
anger
because
they
originated
in
ignorance
and
were
rendered
plausible
to
welbeck
by
such
facts
as
were
known
to
him
it
was
needless
to
confute
the
charge
by
elaborate
and
circumstantial
details
it
was
true
that
my
recovery
was
in
the
highest
degree
improbable
and
that
my
death
would
put
an
end
to
my
power
over
this
money
but
had
i
not
determined
to
secure
its
useful
application
in
case
of
my
death
this
project
was
obstructed
by
the
presence
of
welbeck
but
i
hoped
that
his
love
of
life
would
induce
him
to
fly
he
might
wrest
this
volume
from
me
by
violence
or
he
might
wait
till
my
death
should
give
him
peaceable
possession
but
these
though
probable
events
were
not
certain
and
would
by
no
means
justify
the
voluntary
surrender
his
strength
if
employed
for
this
end
could
not
be
resisted
but
then
it
would
be
a
sacrifice
not
a
choice
but
necessity
promises
were
easily
given
but
were
surely
not
to
be
confided
in
welbeck's
own
tale
in
which
it
could
not
be
imagined
that
he
had
aggravated
his
defects
attested
the
frailty
of
his
virtue
to
put
into
his
hands
a
sum
like
this
in
expectation
of
his
delivering
it
to
another
when
my
death
would
cover
the
transaction
with
impenetrable
secrecy
would
be
indeed
a
proof
of
that
infatuation
which
he
thought
proper
to
impute
to
me
these
thoughts
influenced
my
resolutions
but
they
were
revolved
in
silence
to
state
them
verbally
was
useless
they
would
not
justify
my
conduct
in
his
eyes
they
would
only
exasperate
dispute
and
impel
him
to
those
acts
of
violence
which
i
was
desirous
of
preventing
the
sooner
this
controversy
should
end
and
i
in
any
measure
be
freed
from
the
obstruction
of
his
company
the
better
mr
welbeck
said
i
my
regard
to
your
safety
compels
me
to
wish
that
this
interview
should
terminate
at
a
different
time
i
should
not
be
unwilling
to
discuss
this
matter
now
it
will
be
fruitless
my
conscience
points
out
to
me
too
clearly
the
path
i
should
pursue
for
me
to
mistake
it
as
long
as
i
have
power
over
this
money
i
shall
keep
it
for
the
use
of
the
unfortunate
lady
whom
i
have
seen
in
this
house
i
shall
exert
myself
to
find
her
but
if
that
be
impossible
i
shall
appropriate
it
in
a
way
in
which
you
shall
have
no
participation
i
will
not
repeat
the
contest
that
succeeded
between
my
forbearance
and
his
passions
i
listened
to
the
dictates
of
his
rage
and
his
avarice
in
silence
astonishment
at
my
inflexibility
was
blended
with
his
anger
by
turns
he
commented
on
the
guilt
and
on
the
folly
of
my
resolutions
sometimes
his
emotions
would
mount
into
fury
and
he
would
approach
me
in
a
menacing
attitude
and
lift
his
hand
as
if
he
would
exterminate
me
at
a
blow
my
languid
eyes
my
cheeks
glowing
and
my
temples
throbbing
with
fever
and
my
total
passiveness
attracted
his
attention
and
arrested
his
stroke
compassion
would
take
the
place
of
rage
and
the
belief
be
revived
that
remonstrances
and
arguments
would
answer
his
purpose
this
scene
lasted
i
know
not
how
long
insensibly
the
passions
and
reasonings
of
welbeck
assumed
a
new
form
a
grief
mingled
with
perplexity
overspread
his
countenance
he
ceased
to
contend
or
to
speak
his
regards
were
withdrawn
from
me
on
whom
they
had
hitherto
been
fixed
and
wandering
or
vacant
testified
a
conflict
of
mind
terrible
beyond
any
that
my
young
imagination
had
ever
conceived
for
a
time
he
appeared
to
be
unconscious
of
my
presence
he
moved
to
and
fro
with
unequal
steps
and
with
gesticulations
that
possessed
a
horrible
but
indistinct
significance
occasionally
he
struggled
for
breath
and
his
efforts
were
directed
to
remove
some
choking
impediment
no
test
of
my
fortitude
had
hitherto
occurred
equal
to
that
to
which
it
was
now
subjected
the
suspicion
which
this
deportment
suggested
was
vague
and
formless
the
tempest
which
i
witnessed
was
the
prelude
of
horror
these
were
throes
which
would
terminate
in
the
birth
of
some
gigantic
and
sanguinary
purpose
did
he
meditate
to
offer
a
bloody
sacrifice
was
his
own
death
or
was
mine
to
attest
the
magnitude
of
his
despair
or
the
impetuosity
of
his
vengeance
suicide
was
familiar
to
his
thoughts
he
had
consented
to
live
but
on
one
condition
that
of
regaining
possession
of
this
money
should
i
be
justified
in
driving
him
by
my
obstinate
refusal
to
this
fatal
consummation
of
his
crimes
yet
my
fear
of
this
catastrophe
was
groundless
hitherto
he
had
argued
and
persuaded
but
this
method
was
pursued
because
it
was
more
eligible
than
the
employment
of
force
or
than
procrastination
no
these
were
tokens
that
pointed
to
me
some
unknown
instigation
was
at
work
within
him
to
tear
away
his
remnant
of
humanity
and
fit
him
for
the
office
of
my
murderer
i
knew
not
how
the
accumulation
of
guilt
could
contribute
to
his
gratification
or
security
his
actions
had
been
partially
exhibited
and
vaguely
seen
what
extenuations
or
omissions
had
vitiated
his
former
or
recent
narrative
how
far
his
actual
performances
were
congenial
with
the
deed
which
was
now
to
be
perpetrated
i
knew
not
these
thoughts
lent
new
rapidity
to
my
blood
i
raised
my
head
from
the
pillow
and
watched
the
deportment
of
this
man
with
deeper
attention
the
paroxysm
which
controlled
him
at
length
in
some
degree
subsided
he
muttered
yes
it
must
come
my
last
humiliation
must
cover
me
my
last
confession
must
be
made
to
die
and
leave
behind
me
this
train
of
enormous
perils
must
not
be
o
clemenza
o
mervyn
ye
have
not
merited
that
i
should
leave
you
a
legacy
of
persecution
and
death
your
safety
must
be
purchased
at
what
price
my
malignant
destiny
will
set
upon
it
the
cord
of
the
executioner
the
note
of
everlasting
infamy
is
better
than
to
leave
you
beset
by
the
consequences
of
my
guilt
it
must
not
be
saying
this
welbeck
cast
fearful
glances
at
the
windows
and
door
he
examined
every
avenue
and
listened
thrice
he
repeated
this
scrutiny
having
as
it
seemed
ascertained
that
no
one
lurked
within
audience
he
approached
the
bed
he
put
his
mouth
close
to
my
face
he
attempted
to
speak
but
once
more
examined
the
apartment
with
suspicious
glances
he
drew
closer
and
at
length
in
a
tone
scarcely
articulate
and
suffocated
with
emotion
he
spoke--excellent
but
fatally-obstinate
youth
know
at
least
the
cause
of
my
importunity
know
at
least
the
depth
of
my
infatuation
and
the
enormity
of
my
guilt
the
bills--surrender
them
to
me
and
save
yourself
from
persecution
and
disgrace
save
the
woman
whom
you
wish
to
benefit
from
the
blackest
imputations
from
hazard
to
her
life
and
her
fame
from
languishing
in
dungeons
from
expiring
on
the
gallows
the
bills--oh
save
me
from
the
bitterness
of
death
let
the
evils
to
which
my
miserable
life
has
given
birth
terminate
here
and
in
myself
surrender
them
to
me
for----
there
he
stopped
his
utterence
was
choked
by
terror
rapid
glances
were
again
darted
at
the
windows
and
door
the
silence
was
uninterrupted
except
by
far-off
sounds
produced
by
some
moving
carriage
once
more
he
summoned
resolution
and
spoke--
surrender
them
to
me--for--they
are
forged
formerly
i
told
you
that
a
scheme
of
forgery
had
been
conceived
shame
would
not
suffer
me
to
add
that
my
scheme
was
carried
into
execution
the
bills
were
fashioned
but
my
fears
contended
against
my
necessities
and
forbade
me
to
attempt
to
exchange
them
the
interview
with
lodi
saved
me
from
the
dangerous
experiment
i
enclosed
them
in
that
volume
as
the
means
of
future
opulence
to
be
used
when
all
other
and
less
hazardous
resources
should
fail
in
the
agonies
of
my
remorse
at
the
death
of
watson
they
were
forgotten
they
afterwards
recurred
to
recollection
my
wishes
pointed
to
the
grave
but
the
stroke
that
should
deliver
me
from
life
was
suspended
only
till
i
could
hasten
hither
get
possession
of
these
papers
and
destroy
them
when
i
thought
upon
the
chances
that
should
give
them
an
owner
bring
them
into
circulation
load
the
innocent
with
suspicion
and
lead
them
to
trial
and
perhaps
to
death
my
sensations
were
fraught
with
agony
earnestly
as
i
panted
for
death
it
was
necessarily
deferred
till
i
had
gained
possession
of
and
destroyed
these
papers
what
now
remains
you
have
found
them
happily
they
have
not
been
used
give
them
therefore
to
me
that
i
may
crush
at
once
the
brood
of
mischiefs
which
they
could
not
but
generate
this
disclosure
was
strange
it
was
accompanied
with
every
token
of
sincerity
how
had
i
tottered
on
the
brink
of
destruction
if
i
had
made
use
of
this
money
in
what
a
labyrinth
of
misery
might
i
not
have
been
involved
my
innocence
could
never
have
been
proved
an
alliance
with
welbeck
could
not
have
failed
to
be
inferred
my
career
would
have
found
an
ignominious
close
or
if
my
punishment
had
been
transmuted
into
slavery
and
toil
would
the
testimony
of
my
conscience
have
supported
me
i
shuddered
at
the
view
of
those
disasters
from
which
i
was
rescued
by
the
miraculous
chance
which
led
me
to
this
house
welbeck's
request
was
salutary
to
me
and
honourable
to
himself
i
could
not
hesitate
a
moment
in
compliance
the
notes
were
enclosed
in
paper
and
deposited
in
a
fold
of
my
clothes
i
put
my
hand
upon
them
my
motion
and
attention
were
arrested
at
the
instant
by
a
noise
which
arose
in
the
street
footsteps
were
heard
upon
the
pavement
before
the
door
and
voices
as
if
busy
in
discourse
this
incident
was
adapted
to
infuse
the
deepest
alarm
into
myself
and
my
companion
the
motives
of
our
trepidation
were
indeed
different
and
were
infinitely
more
powerful
in
my
case
than
in
his
it
portended
to
me
nothing
less
than
the
loss
of
my
asylum
and
condemnation
to
an
hospital
welbeck
hurried
to
the
door
to
listen
to
the
conversation
below
this
interval
was
pregnant
with
thought
that
impulse
which
led
my
reflections
from
welbeck
to
my
own
state
passed
away
in
a
moment
and
suffered
me
to
meditate
anew
upon
the
terms
of
that
confession
which
had
just
been
made
horror
at
the
fate
which
this
interview
had
enabled
me
to
shun
was
uppermost
in
my
conceptions
i
was
eager
to
surrender
these
fatal
bills
i
held
them
for
that
purpose
in
my
hand
and
was
impatient
for
welbeck's
return
he
continued
at
the
door
stooping
with
his
face
averted
and
eagerly
attentive
to
the
conversation
in
the
street
all
the
circumstances
of
my
present
situation
tended
to
arrest
the
progress
of
thought
and
chain
my
contemplations
to
one
image
but
even
now
there
was
room
for
foresight
and
deliberation
welbeck
intended
to
destroy
these
bills
perhaps
he
had
not
been
sincere
or
if
his
purpose
had
been
honestly
disclosed
this
purpose
might
change
when
the
bills
were
in
his
possession
his
poverty
and
sanguineness
of
temper
might
prompt
him
to
use
them
that
this
conduct
was
evil
and
would
only
multiply
his
miseries
could
not
be
questioned
why
should
i
subject
his
frailty
to
this
temptation
the
destruction
of
these
bills
was
the
loudest
injunction
of
my
duty
was
demanded
by
every
sanction
which
bound
me
to
promote
the
welfare
of
mankind
the
means
of
destruction
was
easy
a
lighted
candle
stood
on
a
table
at
the
distance
of
a
few
yards
why
should
i
hesitate
a
moment
to
annihilate
so
powerful
a
cause
of
error
and
guilt
a
passing
instant
was
sufficient
a
momentary
lingering
might
change
the
circumstances
that
surrounded
me
and
frustrate
my
project
my
languors
were
suspended
by
the
urgencies
of
this
occasion
i
started
from
my
bed
and
glided
to
the
table
seizing
the
notes
with
my
right
hand
i
held
them
in
the
flame
of
the
candle
and
then
threw
them
blazing
on
the
floor
the
sudden
illumination
was
perceived
by
welbeck
the
cause
of
it
appeared
to
suggest
itself
as
soon
he
turned
and
marking
the
paper
where
it
lay
leaped
to
the
spot
and
extinguished
the
fire
with
his
foot
his
interposition
was
too
late
only
enough
of
them
remained
to
inform
him
of
the
nature
of
the
sacrifice
welbeck
now
stood
with
limbs
trembling
features
aghast
and
eyes
glaring
upon
me
for
a
time
he
was
without
speech
the
storm
was
gathering
in
silence
and
at
length
burst
upon
me
in
a
tone
menacing
and
loud
he
exclaimed--
wretch
what
have
you
done
i
have
done
justly
these
notes
were
false
you
desired
to
destroy
them
that
they
might
not
betray
the
innocent
i
applauded
your
purpose
and
have
saved
you
from
the
danger
of
temptation
by
destroying
them
myself
maniac
miscreant
to
be
fooled
by
so
gross
an
artifice
the
notes
were
genuine
the
tale
of
their
forgery
was
false
and
meant
only
to
wrest
them
from
you
execrable
and
perverse
idiot
your
deed
has
sealed
my
perdition
it
has
sealed
your
own
you
shall
pay
for
it
with
your
blood
i
will
slay
you
by
inches
i
will
stretch
you
as
you
have
stretched
me
on
the
rack
during
this
speech
all
was
frenzy
and
storm
in
the
countenance
and
features
of
welbeck
nothing
less
could
be
expected
than
that
the
scene
would
terminate
in
some
bloody
catastrophe
i
bitterly
regretted
the
facility
with
which
i
had
been
deceived
and
the
precipitation
of
my
sacrifice
the
act
however
lamentable
could
not
be
revoked
what
remained
but
to
encounter
or
endure
its
consequences
with
unshrinking
firmness
the
contest
was
too
unequal
it
is
possible
that
the
frenzy
which
actuated
welbeck
might
have
speedily
subsided
it
is
more
likely
that
his
passions
would
have
been
satiated
with
nothing
but
my
death
this
event
was
precluded
by
loud
knocks
at
the
street
door
and
calls
by
some
one
on
the
pavement
without
of--who
is
within
is
any
one
within
these
noises
gave
a
new
direction
to
welbeck's
thoughts
they
are
coming
said
he
they
will
treat
you
as
a
sick
man
and
a
thief
i
cannot
desire
you
to
suffer
a
worse
evil
than
they
will
inflict
i
leave
you
to
your
fate
so
saying
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
though
confounded
and
stunned
by
this
rapid
succession
of
events
i
was
yet
able
to
pursue
measures
for
eluding
these
detested
visitants
i
first
extinguished
the
light
and
then
observing
that
the
parley
in
the
street
continued
and
grew
louder
i
sought
an
asylum
in
the
remotest
corner
of
the
house
during
my
former
abode
here
i
noticed
that
a
trap-door
opened
in
the
ceiling
of
the
third
story
to
which
you
were
conducted
by
a
movable
stair
or
ladder
i
considered
that
this
probably
was
an
opening
into
a
narrow
and
darksome
nook
formed
by
the
angle
of
the
roof
by
ascending
drawing
after
me
the
ladder
and
closing
the
door
i
should
escape
the
most
vigilant
search
enfeebled
as
i
was
by
my
disease
my
resolution
rendered
me
strenuous
i
gained
the
uppermost
room
and
mounting
the
ladder
found
myself
at
a
sufficient
distance
from
suspicion
the
stair
was
hastily
drawn
up
and
the
door
closed
in
a
few
minutes
however
my
new
retreat
proved
to
be
worse
than
any
for
which
it
was
possible
to
change
it
the
air
was
musty
stagnant
and
scorchingly
hot
my
breathing
became
difficult
and
i
saw
that
to
remain
here
ten
minutes
would
unavoidably
produce
suffocation
my
terror
of
intruders
had
rendered
me
blind
to
the
consequences
of
immuring
myself
in
this
cheerless
recess
it
was
incumbent
on
me
to
extricate
myself
as
speedily
as
possible
i
attempted
to
lift
the
door
my
first
effort
was
successless
every
inspiration
was
quicker
and
more
difficult
than
the
former
as
my
terror
so
my
strength
and
my
exertions
increased
finally
my
trembling
hand
lighted
on
a
nail
that
was
imperfectly
driven
into
the
wood
and
which
by
affording
me
a
firmer
hold
enabled
me
at
length
to
raise
it
and
to
inhale
the
air
from
beneath
relieved
from
my
new
peril
by
this
situation
i
bent
an
attentive
ear
through
the
opening
with
a
view
to
ascertain
if
the
house
had
been
entered
or
if
the
outer
door
was
still
beset
but
could
hear
nothing
hence
i
was
authorized
to
conclude
that
the
people
had
departed
and
that
i
might
resume
my
former
station
without
hazard
before
i
descended
however
i
cast
a
curious
eye
over
this
recess
it
was
large
enough
to
accommodate
a
human
being
the
means
by
which
it
was
entered
were
easily
concealed
though
narrow
and
low
it
was
long
and
were
it
possible
to
contrive
some
inlet
for
the
air
one
studious
of
concealment
might
rely
on
its
protection
with
unbounded
confidence
my
scrutiny
was
imperfect
by
reason
of
the
faint
light
which
found
its
way
through
the
opening
yet
it
was
sufficient
to
set
me
afloat
on
a
sea
of
new
wonders
and
subject
my
fortitude
to
a
new
test--
here
mervyn
paused
in
his
narrative
a
minute
passed
in
silence
and
seeming
indecision
his
perplexities
gradually
disappeared
and
he
continued--





i
have
promised
to
relate
the
momentous
incidents
of
my
life
and
have
hitherto
been
faithful
in
my
enumeration
there
is
nothing
which
i
more
detest
than
equivocation
and
mystery
perhaps
however
i
shall
now
incur
some
imputation
of
that
kind
i
would
willingly
escape
the
accusation
but
confess
that
i
am
hopeless
of
escaping
it
i
might
indeed
have
precluded
your
guesses
and
surmises
by
omitting
to
relate
what
befell
me
from
the
time
of
my
leaving
my
chamber
till
i
regained
it
i
might
deceive
you
by
asserting
that
nothing
remarkable
occurred
but
this
would
be
false
and
every
sacrifice
is
trivial
which
is
made
upon
the
altar
of
sincerity
besides
the
time
may
come
when
no
inconvenience
will
arise
from
minute
descriptions
of
the
objects
which
i
now
saw
and
of
the
reasonings
and
inferences
which
they
suggested
to
my
understanding
at
present
it
appears
to
be
my
duty
to
pass
them
over
in
silence
but
it
would
be
needless
to
conceal
from
you
that
the
interval
though
short
and
the
scrutiny
though
hasty
furnished
matter
which
my
curiosity
devoured
with
unspeakable
eagerness
and
from
which
consequences
may
hereafter
flow
deciding
on
my
peace
and
my
life
nothing
however
occurred
which
could
detain
me
long
in
this
spot
i
once
more
sought
the
lower
story
and
threw
myself
on
the
bed
which
i
had
left
my
mind
was
thronged
with
the
images
flowing
from
my
late
adventure
my
fever
had
gradually
increased
and
my
thoughts
were
deformed
by
inaccuracy
and
confusion
my
heart
did
not
sink
when
i
reverted
to
my
own
condition
that
i
should
quickly
be
disabled
from
moving
was
readily
perceived
the
foresight
of
my
destiny
was
steadfast
and
clear
to
linger
for
days
in
this
comfortless
solitude
to
ask
in
vain
not
for
powerful
restoratives
or
alleviating
cordials
but
for
water
to
moisten
my
burning
lips
and
abate
the
torments
of
thirst
ultimately
to
expire
in
torpor
or
frenzy
was
the
fate
to
which
i
looked
forward
yet
i
was
not
terrified
i
seemed
to
be
sustained
by
a
preternatural
energy
i
felt
as
if
the
opportunity
of
combating
such
evils
was
an
enviable
privilege
and
though
none
would
witness
my
victorious
magnanimity
yet
to
be
conscious
that
praise
was
my
due
was
all
that
my
ambition
required
these
sentiments
were
doubtless
tokens
of
delirium
the
excruciating
agonies
which
now
seized
upon
my
head
and
the
cord
which
seemed
to
be
drawn
across
my
breast
and
which
as
my
fancy
imagined
was
tightened
by
some
forcible
hand
with
a
view
to
strangle
me
were
incompatible
with
sober
and
coherent
views
thirst
was
the
evil
which
chiefly
oppressed
me
the
means
of
relief
was
pointed
out
by
nature
and
habit
i
rose
and
determined
to
replenish
my
pitcher
at
the
well
it
was
easier
however
to
descend
than
to
return
my
limbs
refused
to
bear
me
and
i
sat
down
upon
the
lower
step
of
the
staircase
several
hours
had
elapsed
since
my
entrance
into
this
dwelling
and
it
was
now
night
my
imagination
now
suggested
a
new
expedient
medlicote
was
a
generous
and
fearless
spirit
to
put
myself
under
his
protection
if
i
could
walk
as
far
as
his
lodgings
was
the
wisest
proceeding
which
i
could
adopt
from
this
design
my
incapacity
to
walk
thus
far
and
the
consequences
of
being
discovered
in
the
street
had
hitherto
deterred
me
these
impediments
were
now
in
the
confusion
of
my
understanding
overlooked
or
despised
and
i
forthwith
set
out
upon
this
hopeless
expedition
the
doors
communicating
with
the
court
and
through
the
court
with
the
street
were
fastened
by
inside
bolts
these
were
easily
withdrawn
and
i
issued
forth
with
alacrity
and
confidence
my
perturbed
senses
and
the
darkness
hindered
me
from
discerning
the
right
way
i
was
conscious
of
this
difficulty
but
was
not
disheartened
i
proceeded
as
i
have
since
discovered
in
a
direction
different
from
the
true
but
hesitated
not
till
my
powers
were
exhausted
and
i
sunk
upon
the
ground
i
closed
my
eyes
and
dismissed
all
fear
and
all
foresight
of
futurity
in
this
situation
i
remained
some
hours
and
should
probably
have
expired
on
this
spot
had
not
i
attracted
your
notice
and
been
provided
under
this
roof
with
all
that
medical
skill
that
the
tenderest
humanity
could
suggest
in
consequence
of
your
care
i
have
been
restored
to
life
and
to
health
your
conduct
was
not
influenced
by
the
prospect
of
pecuniary
recompense
of
service
or
of
gratitude
it
is
only
in
one
way
that
i
am
able
to
heighten
the
gratification
which
must
flow
from
reflection
on
your
conduct--by
showing
that
the
being
whose
life
you
have
prolonged
though
uneducated
ignorant
and
poor
is
not
profligate
and
worthless
and
will
not
dedicate
that
life
which
your
bounty
has
given
to
mischievous
or
contemptible
purposes
end
of
vol
i
arthur
mervyn
or
memoirs
of
the
year
1793
vol
ii
arthur
mervyn
here
ended
the
narrative
of
mervyn
surely
its
incidents
were
of
no
common
kind
during
this
season
of
pestilence
my
opportunities
of
observation
had
been
numerous
and
i
had
not
suffered
them
to
pass
unimproved
the
occurrences
which
fell
within
my
own
experience
bore
a
general
resemblance
to
those
which
had
just
been
related
but
they
did
not
hinder
the
latter
from
striking
on
my
mind
with
all
the
force
of
novelty
they
served
no
end
but
as
vouchers
for
the
truth
of
the
tale
surely
the
youth
had
displayed
inimitable
and
heroic
qualities
his
courage
was
the
growth
of
benevolence
and
reason
and
not
the
child
of
insensibility
and
the
nursling
of
habit
he
had
been
qualified
for
the
encounter
of
gigantic
dangers
by
no
laborious
education
he
stepped
forth
upon
the
stage
unfurnished
by
anticipation
or
experience
with
the
means
of
security
against
fraud
and
yet
by
the
aid
of
pure
intentions
had
frustrated
the
wiles
of
an
accomplished
and
veteran
deceiver
i
blessed
the
chance
which
placed
the
youth
under
my
protection
when
i
reflected
on
that
tissue
of
nice
contingencies
which
led
him
to
my
door
and
enabled
me
to
save
from
death
a
being
of
such
rare
endowments
my
heart
overflowed
with
joy
not
unmingled
with
regrets
and
trepidation
how
many
have
been
cut
off
by
this
disease
in
their
career
of
virtue
and
their
blossom-time
of
genius
how
many
deeds
of
heroism
and
self-devotion
are
ravished
from
existence
and
consigned
to
hopeless
oblivion
i
had
saved
the
life
of
this
youth
this
was
not
the
limit
of
my
duty
or
my
power
could
i
not
render
that
life
profitable
to
himself
and
to
mankind
the
gains
of
my
profession
were
slender
but
these
gains
were
sufficient
for
his
maintenance
as
well
as
my
own
by
residing
with
me
partaking
my
instructions
and
reading
my
books
he
would
in
a
few
years
be
fitted
for
the
practice
of
physic
a
science
whose
truths
are
so
conducive
to
the
welfare
of
mankind
and
which
comprehends
the
whole
system
of
nature
could
not
but
gratify
a
mind
so
beneficent
and
strenuous
as
his
this
scheme
occurred
to
me
as
soon
as
the
conclusion
of
his
tale
allowed
me
to
think
i
did
not
immediately
mention
it
since
the
approbation
of
my
wife
of
whose
concurrence
however
i
entertained
no
doubt
was
previously
to
be
obtained
dismissing
it
for
the
present
from
my
thoughts
i
reverted
to
the
incidents
of
his
tale
the
lady
whom
welbeck
had
betrayed
and
deserted
was
not
unknown
to
me
i
was
but
too
well
acquainted
with
her
fate
if
she
had
been
single
in
calamity
her
tale
would
have
been
listened
to
with
insupportable
sympathy
but
the
frequency
of
the
spectacle
of
distress
seems
to
lessen
the
compassion
with
which
it
is
reviewed
now
that
those
scenes
are
only
remembered
my
anguish
is
greater
than
when
they
were
witnessed
then
every
new
day
was
only
a
repetition
of
the
disasters
of
the
foregoing
my
sensibility
if
not
extinguished
was
blunted
and
i
gazed
upon
the
complicated
ills
of
poverty
and
sickness
with
a
degree
of
unconcern
on
which
i
should
once
have
reflected
with
astonishment
the
fate
of
clemenza
lodi
was
not
perhaps
more
signal
than
many
which
have
occurred
it
threw
detestable
light
upon
the
character
of
welbeck
and
showed
him
to
be
more
inhuman
than
the
tale
of
mervyn
had
evinced
him
to
be
that
man
indeed
was
hitherto
imperfectly
seen
the
time
had
not
come
which
should
fully
unfold
the
enormity
of
his
transgressions
and
the
complexity
of
his
frauds
there
lived
in
a
remote
quarter
of
the
city
a
woman
by
name
villars
who
passed
for
the
widow
of
an
english
officer
her
manners
and
mode
of
living
were
specious
she
had
three
daughters
well
trained
in
the
school
of
fashion
and
elegant
in
person
manners
and
dress
they
had
lately
arrived
from
europe
and
for
a
time
received
from
their
neighbours
that
respect
to
which
their
education
and
fortune
appeared
to
lay
claim
the
fallacy
of
their
pretensions
slowly
appeared
it
began
to
be
suspected
that
their
subsistence
was
derived
not
from
pension
or
patrimony
but
from
the
wages
of
pollution
their
habitation
was
clandestinely
frequented
by
men
who
were
unfaithful
to
their
secret
one
of
these
was
allied
to
me
by
ties
which
authorized
me
in
watching
his
steps
and
detecting
his
errors
with
a
view
to
his
reformation
from
him
i
obtained
a
knowledge
of
the
genuine
character
of
these
women
a
man
like
welbeck
who
was
the
slave
of
depraved
appetites
could
not
fail
of
being
quickly
satiated
with
innocence
and
beauty
some
accident
introduced
him
to
the
knowledge
of
this
family
and
the
youngest
daughter
found
him
a
proper
subject
on
which
to
exercise
her
artifices
it
was
to
the
frequent
demands
made
upon
his
purse
by
this
woman
that
part
of
the
embarrassments
in
which
mervyn
found
him
involved
are
to
be
ascribed
to
this
circumstance
must
likewise
be
imputed
his
anxiety
to
transfer
to
some
other
the
possession
of
the
unhappy
stranger
why
he
concealed
from
mervyn
his
connection
with
lucy
villars
may
be
easily
imagined
his
silence
with
regard
to
clemenza's
asylum
will
not
create
surprise
when
it
was
told
that
she
was
placed
with
mrs
villars
on
what
conditions
she
was
received
under
this
roof
cannot
be
so
readily
conjectured
it
is
obvious
however
to
suppose
that
advantage
was
to
be
taken
of
her
ignorance
and
weakness
and
that
they
hoped
in
time
to
make
her
an
associate
in
their
profligate
schemes
the
appearance
of
pestilence
meanwhile
threw
them
into
panic
and
they
hastened
to
remove
from
danger
mrs
villars
appears
to
have
been
a
woman
of
no
ordinary
views
she
stooped
to
the
vilest
means
of
amassing
money
but
this
money
was
employed
to
secure
to
herself
and
her
daughters
the
benefits
of
independence
she
purchased
the
house
which
she
occupied
in
the
city
and
a
mansion
in
the
environs
well
built
and
splendidly
furnished
to
the
latter
she
and
her
family
of
which
the
italian
girl
was
now
a
member
retired
at
the
close
of
july
i
have
mentioned
that
the
source
of
my
intelligence
was
a
kinsman
who
had
been
drawn
from
the
paths
of
sobriety
and
rectitude
by
the
impetuosity
of
youthful
passions
he
had
power
to
confess
and
deplore
but
none
to
repair
his
errors
one
of
these
women
held
him
by
a
spell
which
he
struggled
in
vain
to
dissolve
and
by
which
in
spite
of
resolutions
and
remorses
he
was
drawn
to
her
feet
and
made
to
sacrifice
to
her
pleasure
his
reputation
and
his
fortune
my
house
was
his
customary
abode
during
those
intervals
in
which
he
was
persuaded
to
pursue
his
profession
some
time
before
the
infection
began
its
progress
he
had
disappeared
no
tidings
were
received
of
him
till
a
messenger
arrived
entreating
my
assistance
i
was
conducted
to
the
house
of
mrs
villars
in
which
i
found
no
one
but
my
kinsman
here
it
seems
he
had
immured
himself
from
my
inquiries
and
on
being
seized
by
the
reigning
malady
had
been
deserted
by
the
family
who
ere
they
departed
informed
me
by
a
messenger
of
his
condition
despondency
combined
with
his
disease
to
destroy
him
before
he
died
he
informed
me
fully
of
the
character
of
his
betrayers
the
late
arrival
name
and
personal
condition
of
clemenza
lodi
were
related
welbeck
was
not
named
but
was
described
in
terms
which
combined
with
the
narrative
of
mervyn
enabled
me
to
recognise
the
paramour
of
lucy
villars
in
the
man
whose
crimes
had
been
the
principal
theme
of
our
discourse
mervyn's
curiosity
was
greatly
roused
when
i
intimated
my
acquaintance
with
the
fate
of
clemenza
in
answer
to
his
eager
interrogations
i
related
what
i
knew
the
tale
plunged
him
into
reverie
recovering
at
length
from
his
thoughtfulness
he
spoke--
her
condition
is
perilous
the
poverty
of
welbeck
will
drive
him
far
from
her
abode
her
profligate
protectors
will
entice
her
or
abandon
her
to
ruin
cannot
she
be
saved
i
know
not
answered
i
by
what
means
the
means
are
obvious
let
her
remove
to
some
other
dwelling
let
her
be
apprized
of
the
vices
of
those
who
surround
her
let
her
be
entreated
to
fly
the
will
need
only
be
inspired
the
danger
need
only
be
shown
and
she
is
safe
for
she
will
remove
beyond
its
reach
thou
art
an
adventurous
youth
who
wilt
thou
find
to
undertake
the
office
who
will
be
persuaded
to
enter
the
house
of
a
stranger
seek
without
an
introduction
the
presence
of
this
girl
tell
her
that
the
house
she
inhabits
is
a
house
of
prostitution
prevail
on
her
to
believe
the
tale
and
persuade
her
to
accompany
him
who
will
open
his
house
to
the
fugitive
whom
will
you
convince
that
her
illicit
intercourse
with
welbeck
of
which
the
opprobrious
tokens
cannot
be
concealed
has
not
fitted
her
for
the
company
of
prostitutes
and
made
her
unworthy
of
protection
who
will
adopt
into
their
family
a
stranger
whose
conduct
has
incurred
infamy
and
whose
present
associates
have
no
doubt
made
her
worthy
of
the
curse
true
these
are
difficulties
which
i
did
not
foresee
must
she
then
perish
shall
not
something
be
done
to
rescue
her
from
infamy
and
guilt
it
is
neither
in
your
power
nor
in
mine
to
do
any
thing
the
lateness
of
the
hour
put
an
end
to
our
conversation
and
summoned
us
to
repose
i
seized
the
first
opportunity
of
imparting
to
my
wife
the
scheme
which
had
occurred
relative
to
our
guest
with
which
as
i
expected
she
readily
concurred
in
the
morning
i
mentioned
it
to
mervyn
i
dwelt
upon
the
benefits
that
adhered
to
the
medical
profession
the
power
which
it
confers
of
lightening
the
distresses
of
our
neighbours
the
dignity
which
popular
opinion
annexes
to
it
the
avenue
which
it
opens
to
the
acquisition
of
competence
the
freedom
from
servile
cares
which
attends
it
and
the
means
of
intellectual
gratification
with
which
it
supplies
us
as
i
spoke
his
eyes
sparkled
with
joy
yes
said
he
with
vehemence
i
willingly
embrace
your
offer
i
accept
this
benefit
because
i
know
that
if
my
pride
should
refuse
it
i
should
prove
myself
less
worthy
than
you
think
and
give
you
pain
instead
of
that
pleasure
which
i
am
bound
to
confer
i
would
enter
on
the
duties
and
studies
of
my
new
profession
immediately
but
somewhat
is
due
to
mr
hadwin
and
his
daughters
i
cannot
vanquish
my
inquietudes
respecting
them
but
by
returning
to
malverton
and
ascertaining
their
state
with
my
own
eyes
you
know
in
what
circumstances
i
parted
with
wallace
and
mr
hadwin
i
am
not
sure
that
either
of
them
ever
reached
home
or
that
they
did
not
carry
the
infection
along
with
them
i
now
find
myself
sufficiently
strong
to
perform
the
journey
and
purposed
to
have
acquainted
you
at
this
interview
with
my
intentions
an
hour's
delay
is
superfluous
and
i
hope
you
will
consent
to
my
setting
out
immediately
rural
exercise
and
air
for
a
week
or
fortnight
will
greatly
contribute
to
my
health
no
objection
could
be
made
to
this
scheme
his
narrative
had
excited
no
common
affection
in
our
bosoms
for
the
hadwins
his
visit
could
not
only
inform
us
of
their
true
state
but
would
dispel
that
anxiety
which
they
could
not
but
entertain
respecting
our
guest
it
was
a
topic
of
some
surprise
that
neither
wallace
nor
hadwin
had
returned
to
the
city
with
a
view
to
obtain
some
tidings
of
their
friend
it
was
more
easy
to
suppose
them
to
have
been
detained
by
some
misfortune
than
by
insensibility
or
indolence
in
a
few
minutes
mervyn
bade
us
adieu
and
set
out
upon
his
journey
promising
to
acquaint
us
with
the
state
of
affairs
as
soon
as
possible
after
his
arrival
we
parted
from
him
with
reluctance
and
found
no
consolation
but
in
the
prospect
of
his
speedy
return
during
his
absence
conversation
naturally
turned
upon
those
topics
which
were
suggested
by
the
narrative
and
deportment
of
this
youth
different
conclusions
were
formed
by
his
two
auditors
they
had
both
contracted
a
deep
interest
in
his
welfare
and
an
ardent
curiosity
as
to
those
particulars
which
his
unfinished
story
had
left
in
obscurity
the
true
character
and
actual
condition
of
welbeck
were
themes
of
much
speculation
whether
he
were
dead
or
alive
near
or
distant
from
his
ancient
abode
was
a
point
on
which
neither
mervyn
nor
any
of
those
with
whom
i
had
means
of
intercourse
afforded
any
information
whether
he
had
shared
the
common
fate
and
had
been
carried
by
the
collectors
of
the
dead
from
the
highway
or
the
hovel
to
the
pits
opened
alike
for
the
rich
and
the
poor
the
known
and
the
unknown
whether
he
had
escaped
to
a
foreign
shore
or
were
destined
to
reappear
upon
this
stage
were
questions
involved
in
uncertainty
the
disappearance
of
watson
would
at
a
different
time
have
excited
much
inquiry
and
suspicion
but
as
this
had
taken
place
on
the
eve
of
the
epidemic
his
kindred
and
friends
would
acquiesce
without
scruple
in
the
belief
that
he
had
been
involved
in
the
general
calamity
and
was
to
be
numbered
among
the
earliest
victims
those
of
his
profession
usually
resided
in
the
street
where
the
infection
began
and
where
its
ravages
had
been
most
destructive
and
this
circumstance
would
corroborate
the
conclusions
of
his
friends
i
did
not
perceive
any
immediate
advantage
to
flow
from
imparting
the
knowledge
i
had
lately
gained
to
others
shortly
after
mervyn's
departure
to
malverton
i
was
visited
by
wortley
inquiring
for
my
guest
i
told
him
that
having
recovered
his
health
he
had
left
my
house
he
repeated
his
invectives
against
the
villany
of
welbeck
his
suspicions
of
mervyn
and
his
wishes
for
another
interview
with
the
youth
why
had
i
suffered
him
to
depart
and
whither
had
he
gone
he
has
gone
for
a
short
time
into
the
country
i
expect
him
to
return
in
less
than
a
week
when
you
will
meet
with
him
here
as
often
as
you
please
for
i
expect
him
to
take
up
his
abode
in
this
house
much
astonishment
and
disapprobation
were
expressed
by
my
friend
i
hinted
that
the
lad
had
made
disclosures
to
me
which
justified
my
confidence
in
his
integrity
these
proofs
of
his
honesty
were
not
of
a
nature
to
be
indiscriminately
unfolded
mervyn
had
authorized
me
to
communicate
so
much
of
his
story
to
wortley
as
would
serve
to
vindicate
him
from
the
charge
of
being
welbeck's
co-partner
in
fraud
but
this
end
would
only
be
counteracted
by
an
imperfect
tale
and
the
full
recital
though
it
might
exculpate
mervyn
might
produce
inconveniences
by
which
this
advantage
would
be
outweighed
wortley
as
might
be
naturally
expected
was
by
no
means
satisfied
with
this
statement
he
suspected
that
mervyn
was
a
wily
impostor
that
he
had
been
trained
in
the
arts
of
fraud
under
an
accomplished
teacher
that
the
tale
which
he
had
told
to
me
was
a
tissue
of
ingenious
and
plausible
lies
that
the
mere
assertions
however
plausible
and
solemn
of
one
like
him
whose
conduct
had
incurred
such
strong
suspicions
were
unworthy
of
the
least
credit
it
cannot
be
denied
continued
my
friend
that
he
lived
with
welbeck
at
the
time
of
his
elopement
that
they
disappeared
together
that
they
entered
a
boat
at
pine
street
wharf
at
midnight
that
this
boat
was
discovered
by
the
owner
in
the
possession
of
a
fisherman
at
redbank
who
affirmed
that
he
had
found
it
stranded
near
his
door
the
day
succeeding
that
on
which
they
disappeared
of
all
this
i
can
supply
you
with
incontestable
proof
if
after
this
proof
you
can
give
credit
to
his
story
i
shall
think
you
made
of
very
perverse
and
credulous
materials
the
proof
you
mention
said
i
will
only
enhance
his
credibility
all
the
facts
which
you
have
stated
have
been
admitted
by
him
they
constitute
an
essential
portion
of
his
narrative
what
then
is
the
inference
are
not
these
evidences
of
a
compact
between
them
has
he
not
acknowledged
this
compact
in
confessing
that
he
knew
welbeck
was
my
debtor
that
he
was
apprized
of
his
flight
but
that
what
matchless
effrontery
he
had
promised
secrecy
and
would
by
no
means
betray
him
you
say
he
means
to
return
but
of
that
i
doubt
you
will
never
see
his
face
more
he
is
too
wise
to
thrust
himself
again
into
the
noose
but
i
do
not
utterly
despair
of
lighting
upon
welbeck
old
thetford
jamieson
and
i
have
sworn
to
hunt
him
through
the
world
i
have
strong
hopes
that
he
has
not
strayed
far
some
intelligence
has
lately
been
received
which
has
enabled
us
to
place
our
hounds
upon
his
scent
he
may
double
and
skulk
but
if
he
does
not
fall
into
our
toils
at
last
he
will
have
the
agility
and
cunning
as
well
as
the
malignity
of
devils
the
vengeful
disposition
thus
betrayed
by
wortley
was
not
without
excuse
the
vigour
of
his
days
had
been
spent
in
acquiring
a
slender
capital
his
diligence
and
honesty
had
succeeded
and
he
had
lately
thought
his
situation
such
as
to
justify
marriage
with
an
excellent
woman
to
whom
he
had
for
years
been
betrothed
but
from
whom
his
poverty
had
hitherto
compelled
him
to
live
separate
scarcely
had
this
alliance
taken
place
and
the
full
career
of
nuptial
enjoyments
begun
when
his
ill
fate
exposed
him
to
the
frauds
of
welbeck
and
brought
him
in
one
evil
hour
to
the
brink
of
insolvency
jamieson
and
thetford
however
were
rich
and
i
had
not
till
now
been
informed
that
they
had
reasons
for
pursuing
welbeck
with
peculiar
animosity
the
latter
was
the
uncle
of
him
whose
fate
had
been
related
by
mervyn
and
was
one
of
those
who
employed
money
not
as
the
medium
of
traffic
but
as
in
itself
a
commodity
he
had
neither
wines
nor
cloths
to
transmute
into
silver
he
thought
it
a
tedious
process
to
exchange
to-day
one
hundred
dollars
for
a
cask
or
bale
and
to-morrow
exchange
the
bale
or
cask
for
one
hundred
and
ten
dollars
it
was
better
to
give
the
hundred
for
a
piece
of
paper
which
carried
forthwith
to
the
money-changers
he
could
procure
a
hundred
twenty-three
and
three-fourths
in
short
this
man's
coffers
were
supplied
by
the
despair
of
honest
men
and
the
stratagems
of
rogues
i
did
not
immediately
suspect
how
this
man's
prudence
and
indefatigable
attention
to
his
own
interest
should
allow
him
to
become
the
dupe
of
welbeck
what
said
i
is
old
thetford's
claim
upon
welbeck
it
is
a
claim
he
replied
that
if
it
ever
be
made
good
will
doom
welbeck
to
imprisonment
and
wholesome
labour
for
life
how
surely
it
is
nothing
more
than
debt
have
you
not
heard
but
that
is
no
wonder
happily
you
are
a
stranger
to
mercantile
anxieties
and
revolutions
your
fortune
does
not
rest
on
a
basis
which
an
untoward

that
hoary
dealer
in
suspicions
was
persuaded
to
put
his
hand
to
three
notes
for
eight
hundred
dollars
each
the
eight
was
then
dexterously
prolonged
to
eighteen
they
were
duly
deposited
in

and

and
the
next

welbeck
was
credited
for
fifty-three
hundred
and
seventy-three
which
an
hour
after
were
told
out
to
his
messenger
hard
to
say
whether

old

or
rage
be
uppermost

disdains
all

jamieson
who
deals
in
the
same
stuff
with
thetford
was
outwitted
in
the
same
manner
to
the
same
amount
and
on
the
same
day
this
welbeck
must
have
powers
above
the
common
rate
of
mortals
grown
gray
in
studying
the
follies
and
the
stratagems
of
men
these
veterans
were
overreached
no
one
pities
them
'twere
well
if
his
artifices
had
been
limited
to
such
and
he
had
spared
the
honest
and
the
poor
it
is
for
his
injuries
to
men
who
have
earned
their
scanty
subsistence
without
forfeiting
their
probity
that
i
hate
him
and
shall
exult
to
see
him
suffer
all
the
rigours
of
the
law
here
wortley's
engagements
compelled
him
to
take
his
leave
while
musing
upon
these
facts
i
could
not
but
reflect
with
astonishment
on
the
narrow
escapes
which
mervyn's
virtue
had
experienced
i
was
by
no
means
certain
that
his
fame
or
his
life
was
exempt
from
all
danger
or
that
the
suspicions
which
had
already
been
formed
respecting
him
could
possibly
be
wiped
away
nothing
but
his
own
narrative
repeated
with
that
simple
but
nervous
eloquence
which
we
had
witnessed
could
rescue
him
from
the
most
heinous
charges
was
there
any
tribunal
that
would
not
acquit
him
on
merely
hearing
his
defence
surely
the
youth
was
honest
his
tale
could
not
be
the
fruit
of
invention
and
yet
what
are
the
bounds
of
fraud
nature
has
set
no
limits
to
the
combinations
of
fancy
a
smooth
exterior
a
show
of
virtue
and
a
specious
tale
are
a
thousand
times
exhibited
in
human
intercourse
by
craft
and
subtlety
motives
are
endlessly
varied
while
actions
continue
the
same
and
an
acute
penetration
may
not
find
it
hard
to
select
and
arrange
motives
suited
to
exempt
from
censure
any
action
that
a
human
being
can
commit
had
i
heard
mervyn's
story
from
another
or
read
it
in
a
book
i
might
perhaps
have
found
it
possible
to
suspect
the
truth
but
as
long
as
the
impression
made
by
his
tones
gestures
and
looks
remained
in
my
memory
this
suspicion
was
impossible
wickedness
may
sometimes
be
ambiguous
its
mask
may
puzzle
the
observer
our
judgment
may
be
made
to
falter
and
fluctuate
but
the
face
of
mervyn
is
the
index
of
an
honest
mind
calm
or
vehement
doubting
or
confident
it
is
full
of
benevolence
and
candour
he
that
listens
to
his
words
may
question
their
truth
but
he
that
looks
upon
his
countenance
when
speaking
cannot
withhold
his
faith
it
was
possible
however
to
find
evidence
supporting
or
confuting
his
story
i
chanced
to
be
acquainted
with
a
family
by
name
althorpe
who
were
natives
of
that
part
of
the
country
where
his
father
resided
i
paid
them
a
visit
and
after
a
few
preliminaries
mentioned
as
if
by
accident
the
name
of
mervyn
they
immediately
recognised
this
name
as
belonging
to
one
of
their
ancient
neighbours
the
death
of
the
wife
and
sons
and
the
seduction
of
the
only
daughter
by
colvill
with
many
pathetic
incidents
connected
with
the
fate
of
this
daughter
were
mentioned
this
intelligence
induced
me
to
inquire
of
mrs
althorpe
a
sensible
and
candid
woman
if
she
were
acquainted
with
the
recent
or
present
situation
of
this
family
i
cannot
say
much
she
answered
of
my
own
knowledge
since
my
marriage
i
am
used
to
spend
a
few
weeks
of
summer
at
my
father's
but
am
less
inquisitive
than
i
once
was
into
the
concerns
of
my
old
neighbours
i
recollect
however
when
there
last
year
during
the
fever
to
have
heard
that
sawny
mervyn
had
taken
a
second
wife
that
his
only
son
a
youth
of
eighteen
had
thought
proper
to
be
highly
offended
with
his
father's
conduct
and
treated
the
new
mistress
of
the
house
with
insult
and
contempt
i
should
not
much
wonder
at
this
seeing
children
are
so
apt
to
deem
themselves
unjustly
treated
by
a
second
marriage
of
their
parent
but
it
was
hinted
that
the
boy's
jealousy
and
discontent
were
excited
by
no
common
cause
the
new
mother
was
not
much
older
than
himself
had
been
a
servant
of
the
family
and
a
criminal
intimacy
had
subsisted
between
her
while
in
that
condition
and
the
son
her
marriage
with
his
father
was
justly
accounted
by
their
neighbours
a
most
profligate
and
odious
transaction
the
son
perhaps
had
in
such
a
case
a
right
to
scold
but
he
ought
not
to
have
carried
his
anger
to
such
extremes
as
have
been
imputed
to
him
he
is
said
to
have
grinned
upon
her
with
contempt
and
even
to
have
called
her
strumpet
in
the
presence
of
his
father
and
of
strangers
it
was
impossible
for
such
a
family
to
keep
together
arthur
took
leave
one
night
to
possess
himself
of
all
his
father's
cash
mount
the
best
horse
in
his
meadow
and
elope
for
a
time
no
one
knew
whither
he
had
gone
at
last
one
was
said
to
have
met
with
him
in
the
streets
of
this
city
metamorphosed
from
a
rustic
lad
into
a
fine
gentleman
nothing
could
be
quicker
than
this
change
for
he
left
the
country
on
a
saturday
morning
and
was
seen
in
a
french
frock
and
silk
stockings
going
into
christ's
church
the
next
day
i
suppose
he
kept
it
up
with
a
high
hand
as
long
as
his
money
lasted
my
lather
paid
us
a
visit
last
week
and
among
other
country-news
told
us
that
sawny
mervyn
had
sold
his
place
his
wife
had
persuaded
him
to
try
his
fortune
in
the
western
country
the
price
of
his
hundred
acres
here
would
purchase
a
thousand
there
and
the
man
being
very
gross
and
ignorant
and
withal
quite
a
simpleton
found
no
difficulty
in
perceiving
that
a
thousand
are
ten
times
more
than
a
hundred
he
was
not
aware
that
a
rood
of
ground
upon
schuylkill
is
tenfold
better
than
an
acre
on
the
tennessee
the
woman
turned
out
to
be
an
artful
profligate
having
sold
his
ground
and
gotten
his
money
he
placed
it
in
her
keeping
and
she
to
enjoy
it
with
the
more
security
ran
away
to
the
city
leaving
him
to
prosecute
his
journey
to
kentucky
moneyless
and
alone
some
time
after
mr
althorpe
and
i
were
at
the
play
when
he
pointed
out
to
me
a
group
of
females
in
an
upper
box
one
of
whom
was
no
other
than
betty
lawrence
it
was
not
easy
to
recognise
in
her
present
gaudy
trim
all
flaunting
with
ribbons
and
shining
with
trinkets
the
same
betty
who
used
to
deal
out
pecks
of
potatoes
and
superintend
her
basket
of
cantaloupes
in
the
jersey
market
in
pasteboard
bonnet
and
linsey
petticoat
her
companions
were
of
the
infamous
class
if
arthur
were
still
in
the
city
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
mother
and
son
might
renew
the
ancient
terms
of
their
acquaintance
the
old
man
thus
robbed
and
betrayed
sought
consolation
in
the
bottle
of
which
he
had
been
at
all
times
over-fond
he
wandered
from
one
tavern
to
another
till
his
credit
was
exhausted
and
then
was
sent
to
jail
where
i
believe
he
is
likely
to
continue
till
his
death
such
my
friend
is
the
history
of
the
mervyns
what
proof
said
i
have
you
of
the
immoral
conduct
of
the
son
of
his
mistreatment
of
his
mother
and
his
elopement
with
his
father's
horse
and
money
i
have
no
proof
but
the
unanimous
report
of
mervyn's
neighbours
respectable
and
honest
men
have
affirmed
in
my
hearing
that
they
had
been
present
when
the
boy
treated
his
mother
in
the
way
that
i
have
described
i
was
besides
once
in
company
with
the
old
man
and
heard
him
bitterly
inveigh
against
his
son
and
charge
him
with
the
fact
of
stealing
his
horse
and
money
i
well
remember
that
tears
rolled
from
his
eyes
while
talking
on
the
subject
as
to
his
being
seen
in
the
city
the
next
day
after
his
elopement
dressed
in
a
most
costly
and
fashionable
manner
i
can
doubt
that
as
little
as
the
rest
for
he
that
saw
him
was
my
father
and
you
who
know
my
father
know
what
credit
is
due
to
his
eyes
and
his
word
he
had
seen
arthur
often
enough
not
to
be
mistaken
and
described
his
appearance
with
great
exactness
the
boy
is
extremely
handsome
give
him
his
due
has
dark
hazel
eyes
auburn
hair
and
very
elegant
proportions
his
air
and
gait
have
nothing
of
the
clown
in
them
take
away
his
jacket
and
trousers
and
you
have
as
spruce
a
fellow
as
ever
came
from
dancing-school
or
college
he
is
the
exact
picture
of
his
mother
and
the
most
perfect
contrast
to
the
sturdy
legs
squat
figure
and
broad
unthinking
sheepish
face
of
the
father
that
can
be
imagined
you
must
confess
that
his
appearance
here
is
a
pretty
strong
proof
of
the
father's
assertions
the
money
given
for
these
clothes
could
not
possibly
have
been
honestly
acquired
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
they
were
bought
or
stolen
for
how
else
should
they
have
been
gotten
what
was
this
lad's
personal
deportment
during
the
life
of
his
mother
and
before
his
father's
second
marriage
very
little
to
the
credit
of
his
heart
or
his
intellects
being
the
youngest
son
the
only
one
who
at
length
survived
and
having
a
powerful
resemblance
to
herself
he
became
the
mother's
favourite
his
constitution
was
feeble
and
he
loved
to
stroll
in
the
woods
more
than
to
plough
or
sow
this
idleness
was
much
against
his
father's
inclination
and
judgment
and
indeed
it
was
the
foundation
of
all
his
vices
when
he
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
do
any
thing
it
was
in
a
bungling
manner
and
so
as
to
prove
that
his
thoughts
were
fixed
on
any
thing
except
his
business
when
his
assistance
was
wanted
he
was
never
to
be
found
at
hand
they
were
compelled
to
search
for
him
among
the
rocks
and
bushes
and
he
was
generally
discovered
sauntering
along
the
bank
of
a
river
or
lolling
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
this
disposition
to
inactivity
and
laziness
in
so
young
a
man
was
very
strange
persons
of
his
age
are
rarely
fond
of
work
but
then
they
are
addicted
to
company
and
sports
and
exercises
they
ride
or
shoot
or
frolic
but
this
being
moped
away
his
time
in
solitude
never
associated
with
other
young
people
never
mounted
a
horse
but
when
he
could
not
help
it
and
never
fired
a
gun
or
angled
for
a
fish
in
his
life
some
people
supposed
him
to
be
half
an
idiot
or
at
least
not
to
be
right
in
his
mind
and
indeed
his
conduct
was
so
very
perverse
and
singular
that
i
do
not
wonder
at
those
who
accounted
for
it
in
this
way
but
surely
said
i
he
had
some
object
of
pursuit
perhaps
he
was
addicted
to
books
far
from
it
on
the
contrary
his
aversion
to
school
was
as
great
as
his
hatred
of
the
plough
he
never
could
get
his
lessons
or
bear
the
least
constraint
he
was
so
much
indulged
by
his
mother
at
home
that
tasks
and
discipline
of
any
kind
were
intolerable
he
was
a
perpetual
truant
till
the
master
one
day
attempting
to
strike
him
he
ran
out
of
the
room
and
never
entered
it
more
the
mother
excused
and
countenanced
his
frowardness
and
the
foolish
father
was
obliged
to
give
way
i
do
not
believe
he
had
two
months'
schooling
in
his
life
perhaps
said
i
he
preferred
studying
by
himself
and
at
liberty
i
have
known
boys
endowed
with
great
curiosity
and
aptitude
to
learning
who
never
could
endure
set
tasks
and
spurned
at
the
pedagogue
and
his
rod
i
have
known
such
likewise
but
this
was
not
one
of
them
i
know
not
whence
he
could
derive
his
love
of
knowledge
or
the
means
of
acquiring
it
the
family
were
totally
illiterate
the
father
was
a
scotch
peasant
whose
ignorance
was
so
great
that
he
could
not
sign
his
name
his
wife
i
believe
could
read
and
might
sometimes
decipher
the
figures
in
an
almanac
but
that
was
all
i
am
apt
to
think
that
the
son's
ability
was
not
much
greater
you
might
as
well
look
for
silver
platters
or
marble
tables
in
his
house
as
for
a
book
or
a
pen
i
remember
calling
at
their
house
one
evening
in
the
winter
before
last
it
was
intensely
cold
and
my
father
who
rode
with
me
having
business
with
sawny
mervyn
we
stopped
a
minute
at
his
gate
and
while
the
two
old
men
were
engaged
in
conversation
i
begged
leave
to
warm
myself
by
the
kitchen
fire
here
in
the
chimney-corner
seated
on
a
block
i
found
arthur
busily
engaged
in
knitting
stockings
i
thought
this
a
whimsical
employment
for
a
young
active
man
i
told
him
so
for
i
wanted
to
put
him
to
the
blush
but
he
smiled
in
my
face
and
answered
without
the
least
discomposure
'just
as
whimsical
a
business
for
a
young
active
woman
pray
did
you
never
knit
a
stocking'
'yes
but
that
was
from
necessity
were
i
of
a
different
sex
or
did
i
possess
the
strength
of
a
man
i
should
rather
work
in
my
field
or
study
my
book'
'rejoice
that
you
are
a
woman
then
and
are
at
liberty
to
pursue
that
which
costs
least
labour
and
demands
most
skill
you
see
though
a
man
i
use
your
privilege
and
prefer
knitting
yarn
to
threshing
my
brain
with
a
book
or
the
barn-floor
with
a
flail'
'i
wonder'
said
i
contemptuously
'you
do
not
put
on
the
petticoat
as
well
as
handle
the
needle'
'do
not
wonder'
he
replied
'it
is
because
i
hate
a
petticoat
encumbrance
as
much
as
i
love
warm
feet
look
there'
offering
the
stocking
to
my
inspection
'is
it
not
well
done'
i
did
not
touch
it
but
sneeringly
said
'excellent
i
wonder
you
do
not
apprentice
yourself
to
a
tailor'
he
looked
at
me
with
an
air
of
ridiculous
simplicity
and
said
'how
prone
the
woman
is
to
wonder
you
call
the
work
excellent
and
yet
wonder
that
i
do
not
make
myself
a
slave
to
improve
my
skill
did
you
learn
needlework
from
seven
years'
squatting
on
a
tailor's
board
had
you
come
to
me
i
would
have
taught
you
in
a
day'
'i
was
taught
at
school'
'and
paid
your
instructor'
'to-be-sure'
''twas
liberty
and
money
thrown
away
send
your
sister
if
you
have
one
to
me
and
i
will
teach
her
without
either
rod
or
wages
will
you'
'you
have
an
old
and
a
violent
antipathy
i
believe
to
any
thing
like
a
school'
'true
it
was
early
and
violent
had
not
you'
'no
i
went
to
school
with
pleasure
for
i
thought
to
read
and
write
were
accomplishments
of
some
value'
'indeed
then
i
misunderstood
you
just
now
i
thought
you
said
that
had
you
the
strength
of
a
man
you
should
prefer
the
plough
and
the
book
to
the
needle
whence
supposing
you
a
female
i
inferred
that
you
had
a
woman's
love
for
the
needle
and
a
fool's
hatred
of
books'
my
father
calling
me
from
without
i
now
made
a
motion
to
go
'stay'
continued
he
with
great
earnestness
throwing
aside
his
knitting-apparatus
and
beginning
in
great
haste
to
pull
off
his
stockings
'draw
these
stockings
over
your
shoes
they
will
save
your
feet
from
the
snow
while
walking
to
your
horse'
half
angry
and
half
laughing
i
declined
the
offer
he
had
drawn
them
off
however
and
holding
them
in
his
hand
'be
persuaded'
said
he
'only
lift
your
feet
and
i
will
slip
them
on
in
a
trice'
finding
me
positive
in
my
refusal
he
dropped
the
stockings
and
without
more
ado
caught
me
up
in
his
arms
rushed
out
of
the
room
and
running
barefoot
through
the
snow
set
me
fairly
on
my
horse
all
was
done
in
a
moment
and
before
i
had
time
to
reflect
on
his
intentions
he
then
seized
my
hand
and
kissing
it
with
great
fervour
exclaimed
'a
thousand
thanks
to
you
for
not
accepting
my
stockings
you
have
thereby
saved
yourself
and
me
the
time
and
toil
of
drawing
on
and
drawing
off
since
you
have
taught
me
to
wonder
let
me
practise
the
lesson
in
wondering
at
your
folly
in
wearing
worsted
shoes
and
silk
stockings
at
a
season
like
this
take
my
counsel
and
turn
your
silk
to
worsted
and
your
worsted
to
leather
then
may
you
hope
for
warm
feet
and
dry
what
leave
the
gate
without
a
blessing
on
your
counsellor'
i
spurred
my
horse
into
a
gallop
glad
to
escape
from
so
strange
a
being
i
could
give
you
many
instances
of
behaviour
equally
singular
and
which
betrayed
a
mixture
of
shrewdness
and
folly
of
kindness
and
impudence
which
justified
perhaps
the
common
notion
that
his
intellects
were
unsound
nothing
was
more
remarkable
than
his
impenetrability
to
ridicule
and
censure
you
might
revile
him
for
hours
and
he
would
listen
to
you
with
invincible
composure
to
awaken
anger
or
shame
in
him
was
impossible
he
would
answer
but
in
such
a
way
as
to
show
him
totally
unaware
of
your
true
meaning
he
would
afterwards
talk
to
you
with
all
the
smiling
affability
and
freedom
of
an
old
friend
every
one
despised
him
for
his
idleness
and
folly
no
less
conspicuous
in
his
words
than
his
actions
but
no
one
feared
him
and
few
were
angry
with
him
till
after
the
detection
of
his
commerce
with
betty
and
his
inhuman
treatment
of
his
father
have
you
good
reasons
for
supposing
him
to
have
been
illicitly
connected
with
that
girl
yes
such
as
cannot
be
discredited
it
would
not
be
proper
for
me
to
state
these
proofs
nay
he
never
denied
it
when
reminded
on
one
occasion
of
the
inference
which
every
impartial
person
would
draw
from
appearances
he
acknowledged
with
his
usual
placid
effrontery
that
the
inference
was
unavoidable
he
even
mentioned
other
concurring
and
contemporary
incidents
which
had
eluded
the
observation
of
his
censurer
and
which
added
still
more
force
to
the
conclusion
he
was
studious
to
palliate
the
vices
of
this
woman
as
long
as
he
was
her
only
paramour
but
after
her
marriage
with
his
father
the
tone
was
changed
he
confessed
that
she
was
tidy
notable
industrious
but
then
she
was
a
prostitute
when
charged
with
being
instrumental
in
making
her
such
and
when
his
companions
dwelt
upon
the
depravity
of
reviling
her
for
vices
which
she
owed
to
him
'true'
he
would
say
'there
is
depravity
and
folly
in
the
conduct
you
describe
make
me
out
if
you
please
to
be
a
villain
what
then
i
was
talking
not
of
myself
but
of
betty
still
this
woman
is
a
prostitute
if
it
were
i
that
made
her
such
with
more
confidence
may
i
make
the
charge
but
think
not
that
i
blame
betty
place
me
in
her
situation
and
i
should
have
acted
just
so
i
should
have
formed
just
such
notions
of
my
interest
and
pursued
it
by
the
same
means
still
say
i
i
would
fain
have
a
different
woman
for
my
father's
wife
and
the
mistress
of
his
family'
this
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
messenger
from
my
wife
who
desired
my
return
immediately
i
had
some
hopes
of
meeting
with
mervyn
some
days
having
now
elapsed
since
his
parting
from
us
and
not
being
conscious
of
any
extraordinary
motives
for
delay
it
was
wortley
however
and
not
mervyn
to
whom
i
was
called
my
friend
came
to
share
with
me
his
suspicions
and
inquietudes
respecting
welbeck
and
mervyn
an
accident
had
newly
happened
which
had
awakened
these
suspicions
afresh
he
desired
a
patient
audience
while
he
explained
them
to
me
these
were
his
words--
to-day
a
person
presented
me
a
letter
from
a
mercantile
friend
at
baltimore
i
easily
discerned
the
bearer
to
be
a
sea-captain
he
was
a
man
of
sensible
and
pleasing
aspect
and
was
recommended
to
my
friendship
and
counsel
in
the
letter
which
he
brought
the
letter
stated
that
a
man
by
name
amos
watson
by
profession
a
mariner
and
a
resident
at
baltimore
had
disappeared
in
the
summer
of
last
year
in
a
mysterious
and
incomprehensible
manner
he
was
known
to
have
arrived
in
this
city
from
jamaica
and
to
have
intended
an
immediate
journey
to
his
family
who
lived
at
baltimore
but
he
never
arrived
there
and
no
trace
of
his
existence
has
since
been
discovered
the
bearer
had
come
to
investigate
if
possible
the
secret
of
his
fate
and
i
was
earnestly
entreated
to
afford
him
all
the
assistance
and
advice
in
my
power
in
the
prosecution
of
his
search
i
expressed
my
willingness
to
serve
the
stranger
whose
name
was
williams
and
after
offering
him
entertainment
at
my
house
which
was
thankfully
accepted
he
proceeded
to
unfold
to
me
the
particulars
of
this
affair
his
story
was
this
'on
the
20th
of
last
june
i
arrived'
said
he
'from
the
west
indies
in
company
with
captain
watson
i
commanded
the
ship
in
which
he
came
as
a
passenger
his
own
ship
being
taken
and
confiscated
by
the
english
we
had
long
lived
in
habits
of
strict
friendship
and
i
loved
him
for
his
own
sake
as
well
as
because
he
had
married
my
sister
we
landed
in
the
morning
and
went
to
dine
with
mr
keysler
since
dead
but
who
then
lived
in
water
street
he
was
extremely
anxious
to
visit
his
family
and
having
a
few
commissions
to
perform
in
the
city
which
would
not
demand
more
than
a
couple
of
hours
he
determined
to
set
out
next
morning
in
the
stage
meanwhile
i
had
engagements
which
required
me
to
repair
with
the
utmost
expedition
to
new
york
i
was
scarcely
less
anxious
than
my
brother
to
reach
baltimore
where
my
friends
also
reside
but
there
was
an
absolute
necessity
of
going
eastward
i
expected
however
to
return
hither
in
three
days
and
then
to
follow
watson
home
shortly
after
dinner
we
parted
he
to
execute
his
commissions
and
i
to
embark
in
the
mail-stage
'in
the
time
prefixed
i
returned
i
arrived
early
in
the
morning
and
prepared
to
depart
again
at
noon
meanwhile
i
called
at
keysler's
this
is
an
old
acquaintance
of
watson's
and
mine
and
in
the
course
of
talk
he
expressed
some
surprise
that
watson
had
so
precipitately
deserted
his
house
i
stated
the
necessity
there
was
for
watson's
immediate
departure
southward
and
added
that
no
doubt
my
brother
had
explained
this
necessity
'why
said
keysler
it
is
true
captain
watson
mentioned
his
intention
of
leaving
town
early
next
day
but
then
he
gave
me
reason
to
expect
that
he
would
sup
and
lodge
with
me
that
night
whereas
he
has
not
made
his
appearance
since
besides
his
trunk
was
brought
to
my
house
this
no
doubt
he
intended
to
carry
home
with
him
but
here
it
remains
still
it
is
not
likely
that
in
the
hurry
of
departure
his
baggage
was
forgotten
hence
i
inferred
that
he
was
still
in
town
and
have
been
puzzling
myself
these
three
days
with
conjectures
as
to
what
is
become
of
him
what
surprises
me
more
is
that
on
inquiring
among
the
few
friends
which
he
has
in
this
city
i
find
them
as
ignorant
of
his
motions
as
myself
i
have
not
indeed
been
wholly
without
apprehensions
that
some
accident
or
other
has
befallen
him'
'i
was
not
a
little
alarmed
by
this
intimation
i
went
myself
agreeably
to
keysler's
directions
to
watson's
friends
and
made
anxious
inquiries
but
none
of
them
had
seen
my
brother
since
his
arrival
i
endeavoured
to
recollect
the
commissions
which
he
designed
to
execute
and
if
possible
to
trace
him
to
the
spot
where
he
last
appeared
he
had
several
packets
to
deliver
one
of
which
was
addressed
to
walter
thetford
him
after
some
inquiry
i
found
out
but
unluckily
he
chanced
to
be
in
the
country
i
found
by
questioning
a
clerk
who
transacted
his
business
in
his
absence
that
a
person
who
answered
the
minute
description
which
i
gave
of
watson
had
been
there
on
the
day
on
which
i
parted
with
him
and
had
left
papers
relative
to
the
capture
of
one
of
thetford's
vessels
by
the
english
this
was
the
sum
of
the
information
he
was
able
to
afford
me
'i
then
applied
to
three
merchants
for
whom
my
brother
had
letters
they
all
acknowledged
the
receipt
of
these
letters
but
they
were
delivered
through
the
medium
of
the
post-office
'i
was
extremely
anxious
to
reach
home
urgent
engagements
compelled
me
to
go
on
without
delay
i
had
already
exhausted
all
the
means
of
inquiry
within
my
reach
and
was
obliged
to
acquiesce
in
the
belief
that
watson
had
proceeded
homeward
at
the
time
appointed
and
left
by
forgetfulness
or
accident
his
trunk
behind
him
on
examining
the
books
kept
at
the
stage-offices
his
name
nowhere
appeared
and
no
conveyance
by
water
had
occurred
during
the
last
week
still
the
only
conjecture
i
could
form
was
that
he
had
gone
homeward
'arriving
at
baltimore
i
found
that
watson
had
not
yet
made
his
appearance
his
wife
produced
a
letter
which
by
the
postmark
appeared
to
have
been
put
into
the
office
at
philadelphia
on
the
morning
after
our
arrival
and
on
which
he
had
designed
to
commence
his
journey
this
letter
had
been
written
by
my
brother
in
my
presence
but
i
had
dissuaded
him
from
sending
it
since
the
same
coach
that
should
bear
the
letter
was
likewise
to
carry
himself
i
had
seen
him
put
it
unwafered
in
his
pocket-book
but
this
letter
unaltered
in
any
part
and
containing
money
which
he
had
at
first
intended
to
enclose
in
it
was
now
conveyed
to
his
wife's
hand
in
this
letter
he
mentioned
his
design
of
setting
out
for
baltimore
on
the
twenty-first
yet
on
that
day
the
letter
itself
had
been
put
into
the
office
'we
hoped
that
a
short
time
would
clear
up
this
mystery
and
bring
the
fugitive
home
but
from
that
day
till
the
present
no
atom
of
intelligence
has
been
received
concerning
him
the
yellow
fever
which
quickly
followed
in
this
city
and
my
own
engagements
have
hindered
me
till
now
from
coming
hither
and
resuming
the
search
'my
brother
was
one
of
the
most
excellent
of
men
his
wife
loved
him
to
distraction
and
together
with
his
children
depended
for
subsistence
upon
his
efforts
you
will
not
therefore
be
surprised
that
his
disappearance
excited
in
us
the
deepest
consternation
and
distress
but
i
have
other
and
peculiar
reasons
for
wishing
to
know
his
fate
i
gave
him
several
bills
of
exchange
on
merchants
of
baltimore
which
i
had
received
in
payment
of
my
cargo
in
order
that
they
might
as
soon
as
possible
be
presented
and
accepted
these
have
disappeared
with
the
bearer
there
is
likewise
another
circumstance
that
makes
his
existence
of
no
small
value
'there
is
an
english
family
who
formerly
resided
in
jamaica
and
possessed
an
estate
of
great
value
but
who
for
some
years
have
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
baltimore
the
head
of
this
family
died
a
year
ago
and
left
a
widow
and
three
daughters
the
lady
thought
it
eligible
to
sell
her
husband's
property
in
jamaica
the
island
becoming
hourly
more
exposed
to
the
chances
of
war
and
revolution
and
transfer
it
to
the
united
states
where
she
purposes
henceforth
to
reside
watson
had
been
her
husband's
friend
and
his
probity
and
disinterestedness
being
well
known
she
intrusted
him
with
legal
powers
to
sell
this
estate
this
commission
was
punctually
performed
and
the
purchase-money
was
received
in
order
to
confer
on
it
the
utmost
possible
security
he
rolled
up
four
bills
of
exchange
drawn
upon
opulent
merchants
of
london
in
a
thin
sheet
of
lead
and
depositing
this
roll
in
a
leathern
girdle
fastened
it
round
his
waist
and
under
his
clothes
a
second
set
he
gave
to
me
and
a
third
he
despatched
to
mr
keysler
by
a
vessel
which
sailed
a
few
days
before
him
on
our
arrival
in
this
city
we
found
that
keysler
had
received
those
transmitted
to
him
and
which
he
had
been
charged
to
keep
till
our
arrival
they
were
now
produced
and
together
with
those
which
i
had
carried
were
delivered
to
watson
by
him
they
were
joined
to
those
in
the
girdle
which
he
still
wore
conceiving
this
method
of
conveyance
to
be
safer
than
any
other
and
at
the
same
time
imagining
it
needless
in
so
short
a
journey
as
remained
to
be
performed
to
resort
to
other
expedients
'the
sum
which
he
thus
bore
about
him
was
no
less
than
ten
thousand
pounds
sterling
it
constituted
the
whole
patrimony
of
a
worthy
and
excellent
family
and
the
loss
of
it
reduces
them
to
beggary
it
is
gone
with
watson
and
whither
watson
has
gone
it
is
impossible
even
to
guess
'you
may
now
easily
conceive
sir
the
dreadful
disasters
which
may
be
connected
with
this
man's
fate
and
with
what
immeasurable
anxiety
his
family
and
friends
have
regarded
his
disappearance
that
he
is
alive
can
scarcely
be
believed
for
in
what
situation
could
he
be
placed
in
which
he
would
not
be
able
and
willing
to
communicate
some
tidings
of
his
fate
to
his
family
'our
grief
has
been
unspeakably
aggravated
by
the
suspicions
which
mrs
maurice
and
her
friends
have
allowed
themselves
to
admit
they
do
not
scruple
to
insinuate
that
watson
tempted
by
so
great
a
prize
has
secretly
embarked
for
england
in
order
to
obtain
payment
for
these
bills
and
retain
the
money
for
his
own
use
'no
man
was
more
impatient
of
poverty
than
watson
but
no
man's
honesty
was
more
inflexible
he
murmured
at
the
destiny
that
compelled
him
to
sacrifice
his
ease
and
risk
his
life
upon
the
ocean
in
order
to
procure
the
means
of
subsistence
and
all
the
property
which
he
had
spent
the
best
part
of
his
life
in
collecting
had
just
been
ravished
away
from
him
by
the
english
but
if
he
had
yielded
to
this
temptation
at
any
time
it
would
have
been
on
receiving
these
bills
at
jamaica
instead
of
coming
hither
it
would
have
been
infinitely
more
easy
and
convenient
to
have
embarked
directly
for
london
but
none
who
thoroughly
knew
him
can
for
a
moment
harbour
a
suspicion
of
his
truth
'if
he
be
dead
and
if
the
bills
are
not
to
be
recovered
yet
to
ascertain
this
will
at
least
serve
to
vindicate
his
character
as
long
as
his
fate
is
unknown
his
fame
will
be
loaded
with
the
most
flagrant
imputations
and
if
these
bills
be
ever
paid
in
london
these
imputations
will
appear
to
be
justified
if
he
has
been
robbed
the
robber
will
make
haste
to
secure
the
payment
and
the
maurices
may
not
unreasonably
conclude
that
the
robber
was
watson
himself'
many
other
particulars
were
added
by
the
stranger
to
show
the
extent
of
the
evils
flowing
from
the
death
of
his
brother
and
the
loss
of
the
papers
which
he
carried
with
him
i
was
greatly
at
a
loss
continued
wortley
what
directions
or
advice
to
afford
this
man
keysler
as
you
know
died
early
of
the
pestilence
but
keysler
was
the
only
resident
in
this
city
with
whom
williams
had
any
acquaintance
on
mentioning
the
propriety
of
preventing
the
sale
of
these
bills
in
america
by
some
public
notice
he
told
me
that
this
caution
had
been
early
taken
and
i
now
remembered
seeing
the
advertisement
in
which
the
bills
had
been
represented
as
having
been
lost
or
stolen
in
this
city
and
a
reward
of
a
thousand
dollars
was
offered
to
any
one
who
should
restore
them
this
caution
had
been
published
in
september
in
all
the
trading-towns
from
portsmouth
to
savannah
but
had
produced
no
satisfaction
i
accompanied
williams
to
the
mayor's
office
in
hopes
of
finding
in
the
records
of
his
proceedings
during
the
last
six
months
some
traces
of
watson
but
neither
these
records
nor
the
memory
of
the
magistrate
afforded
us
any
satisfaction
watson's
friends
had
drawn
up
likewise
a
description
of
the
person
and
dress
of
the
fugitive
an
account
of
the
incidents
attending
his
disappearance
and
of
the
papers
which
he
had
in
his
possession
with
the
manner
in
which
these
papers
had
been
secured
these
had
been
already
published
in
the
southern
newspapers
and
have
been
just
reprinted
in
our
own
as
the
former
notice
had
availed
nothing
this
second
expedient
was
thought
necessary
to
be
employed
after
some
reflection
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
be
proper
to
renew
the
attempt
which
williams
had
made
to
trace
the
footsteps
of
his
friend
to
the
moment
of
his
final
disappearance
he
had
pursued
watson
to
thetford's
but
thetford
himself
had
not
been
seen
and
he
had
been
contented
with
the
vague
information
of
his
clerk
thetford
and
his
family
including
his
clerk
had
perished
and
it
seemed
as
if
this
source
of
information
was
dried
up
it
was
possible
however
that
old
thetford
might
have
some
knowledge
of
his
nephew's
transactions
by
which
some
light
might
chance
to
be
thrown
upon
this
obscurity
i
therefore
called
on
him
but
found
him
utterly
unable
to
afford
me
the
light
that
i
wished
my
mention
of
the
packet
which
watson
had
brought
to
thetford
containing
documents
respecting
the
capture
of
a
certain
ship
reminded
him
of
the
injuries
which
he
had
received
from
welbeck
and
excited
him
to
renew
his
menaces
and
imputations
on
that
wretch
having
somewhat
exhausted
this
rhetoric
he
proceeded
to
tell
me
what
connection
there
was
between
the
remembrance
of
his
injuries
and
the
capture
of
this
vessel
this
vessel
and
its
cargo
were
in
fact
the
property
of
welbeck
they
had
been
sent
to
a
good
market
and
had
been
secured
by
an
adequate
insurance
the
value
of
this
ship
and
cargo
and
the
validity
of
the
policy
he
had
taken
care
to
ascertain
by
means
of
his
two
nephews
one
of
whom
had
gone
out
supercargo
this
had
formed
his
inducement
to
lend
his
three
notes
to
welbeck
in
exchange
for
three
other
notes
the
whole
amount
of
which
included
the
equitable
interest
of
five
per
cent
per
month
on
his
own
loan
for
the
payment
of
these
notes
he
by
no
means
relied
as
the
world
foolishly
imagined
on
the
seeming
opulence
and
secret
funds
of
welbeck
these
were
illusions
too
gross
to
have
any
influence
on
him
he
was
too
old
a
bird
to
be
decoyed
into
the
net
by
such
chaff
no
his
nephew
the
supercargo
would
of
course
receive
the
produce
of
the
voyage
and
so
much
of
this
produce
as
would
pay
his
debt
he
had
procured
the
owner's
authority
to
intercept
its
passage
from
the
pocket
of
his
nephew
to
that
of
welbeck
in
case
of
loss
he
had
obtained
a
similar
security
upon
the
policy
jamieson's
proceedings
had
been
the
same
with
his
own
and
no
affair
in
which
he
had
ever
engaged
had
appeared
to
be
more
free
from
hazard
than
this
their
calculations
however
though
plausible
were
defeated
the
ship
was
taken
and
condemned
for
a
cause
which
rendered
the
insurance
ineffectual
i
bestowed
no
time
in
reflecting
on
this
tissue
of
extortions
and
frauds
and
on
that
course
of
events
which
so
often
disconcerts
the
stratagems
of
cunning
the
names
of
welbeck
and
watson
were
thus
associated
together
and
filled
my
thoughts
with
restlessness
and
suspicion
welbeck
was
capable
of
any
weakness
it
was
possible
an
interview
had
happened
between
these
men
and
that
the
fugitive
had
been
someway
instrumental
in
watson's
fate
these
thoughts
were
mentioned
to
williams
whom
the
name
of
welbeck
threw
into
the
utmost
perturbation
on
finding
that
one
of
this
name
had
dwelt
in
this
city
and
that
he
had
proved
a
villain
he
instantly
admitted
the
most
dreary
forebodings
'i
have
heard'
said
williams
'the
history
of
this
welbeck
a
score
of
times
from
my
brother
there
formerly
subsisted
a
very
intimate
connection
between
them
my
brother
had
conferred
upon
one
whom
he
thought
honest
innumerable
benefits
but
all
his
benefits
had
been
repaid
by
the
blackest
treachery
welbeck's
character
and
guilt
had
often
been
made
the
subject
of
talk
between
us
but
on
these
occasions
my
brother's
placid
and
patient
temper
forsook
him
his
grief
for
the
calamities
which
had
sprung
from
this
man
and
his
desire
of
revenge
burst
all
bounds
and
transported
him
to
a
pitch
of
temporary
frenzy
i
often
inquired
in
what
manner
he
intended
to
act
if
a
meeting
should
take
place
between
them
he
answered
that
doubtless
he
should
act
like
a
maniac
in
defiance
of
his
sober
principles
and
of
the
duty
which
he
owed
his
family
'what
said
i
would
you
stab
or
pistol
him
'no
i
was
not
born
for
an
assassin
i
would
upbraid
him
in
such
terms
as
the
furious
moment
might
suggest
and
then
challenge
him
to
a
meeting
from
which
either
he
or
i
should
not
part
with
life
i
would
allow
time
for
him
to
make
his
peace
with
heaven
and
for
me
to
blast
his
reputation
upon
earth
and
to
make
such
provision
for
my
possible
death
as
duty
and
discretion
would
prescribe
'now
nothing
is
more
probable
than
that
welbeck
and
my
brother
have
met
thetford
would
of
course
mention
his
name
and
interest
in
the
captured
ship
and
hence
the
residence
of
this
detested
being
in
this
city
would
be
made
known
their
meeting
could
not
take
place
without
some
dreadful
consequence
i
am
fearful
that
to
that
meeting
we
must
impute
the
disappearance
of
my
brother'
here
was
new
light
thrown
upon
the
character
of
welbeck
and
new
food
administered
to
my
suspicions
no
conclusion
could
be
more
plausible
than
that
which
williams
had
drawn
but
how
should
it
be
rendered
certain
walter
thetford
or
some
of
his
family
had
possibly
been
witnesses
of
something
which
added
to
our
previous
knowledge
might
strengthen
or
prolong
that
clue
one
end
of
which
seemed
now
to
be
put
into
our
hands
but
thetford's
father-in-law
was
the
only
one
of
his
family
who
by
seasonable
flight
from
the
city
had
escaped
the
pestilence
to
him
who
still
resided
in
the
country
i
repaired
with
all
speed
accompanied
by
williams
the
old
man
being
reminded
by
a
variety
of
circumstances
of
the
incidents
of
that
eventful
period
was
at
length
enabled
to
relate
that
he
had
been
present
at
the
meeting
which
took
place
between
watson
and
his
son
walter
when
certain
packets
were
delivered
by
the
former
relative
as
he
quickly
understood
to
the
condemnation
of
a
ship
in
which
thomas
thetford
had
gone
supercargo
he
had
noticed
some
emotion
of
the
stranger
occasioned
by
his
son's
mentioning
the
concern
which
welbeck
had
in
the
vessel
he
likewise
remembered
the
stranger's
declaring
his
intention
of
visiting
welbeck
and
requesting
walter
to
afford
him
directions
to
his
house
'next
morning
at
the
breakfast-table'
continued
the
old
man
'i
adverted
to
yesterday's
incidents
and
asked
my
son
how
welbeck
had
borne
the
news
of
the
loss
of
his
ship
he
bore
it
said
walter
as
a
man
of
his
wealth
ought
to
bear
so
trivial
a
loss
but
there
was
something
very
strange
in
his
behaviour
says
my
son
when
i
mentioned
the
name
of
the
captain
who
brought
the
papers
and
when
i
mentioned
the
captain's
design
of
paying
him
a
visit
he
stared
upon
me
for
a
moment
as
if
he
were
frighted
out
of
his
wits
and
then
snatching
up
his
hat
ran
furiously
out
of
the
house
this
was
all
my
son
said
upon
that
occasion
but
as
i
have
since
heard
it
was
on
that
very
night
that
welbeck
absconded
from
his
creditors'
i
have
this
moment
returned
from
this
interview
with
old
thetford
i
come
to
you
because
i
thought
it
possible
that
mervyn
agreeably
to
your
expectations
had
returned
and
i
wanted
to
see
the
lad
once
more
my
suspicions
with
regard
to
him
have
been
confirmed
and
a
warrant
was
this
day
issued
for
apprehending
him
as
welbeck's
accomplice
i
was
startled
by
this
news
my
friend
said
i
be
cautious
how
you
act
i
beseech
you
you
know
not
in
what
evils
you
may
involve
the
innocent
mervyn
i
know
to
be
blameless
but
welbeck
is
indeed
a
villain
the
latter
i
shall
not
be
sorry
to
see
brought
to
justice
but
the
former
instead
of
meriting
punishment
is
entitled
to
rewards
so
you
believe
on
the
mere
assertion
of
the
boy
perhaps
his
plausible
lies
might
produce
the
same
effect
upon
me
but
i
must
stay
till
he
thinks
proper
to
exert
his
skill
the
suspicions
to
which
he
is
exposed
will
not
easily
be
obviated
but
if
he
has
any
thing
to
say
in
his
defence
his
judicial
examination
will
afford
him
the
suitable
opportunity
why
are
you
so
much
afraid
to
subject
his
innocence
to
this
test
it
was
not
till
you
heard
his
tale
that
your
own
suspicions
were
removed
allow
me
the
same
privilege
of
unbelief
but
you
do
me
wrong
in
deeming
me
the
cause
of
his
apprehension
it
is
jamieson
and
thetford's
work
and
they
have
not
proceeded
on
shadowy
surmises
and
the
impulses
of
mere
revenge
facts
have
come
to
light
of
which
you
are
wholly
unaware
and
which
when
known
to
you
will
conquer
even
your
incredulity
as
to
the
guilt
of
mervyn
facts
let
me
know
them
i
beseech
you
if
mervyn
has
deceived
me
there
is
an
end
to
my
confidence
in
human
nature
all
limits
to
dissimulation
and
all
distinctness
between
vice
and
virtue
will
be
effaced
no
man's
word
nor
force
of
collateral
evidence
shall
weigh
with
me
a
hair
it
was
time
replied
my
friend
that
your
confidence
in
smooth
features
and
fluent
accents
should
have
ended
long
ago
till
i
gained
from
my
present
profession
some
knowledge
of
the
world
a
knowledge
which
was
not
gained
in
a
moment
and
has
not
cost
a
trifle
i
was
equally
wise
in
my
own
conceit
and
in
order
to
decide
upon
the
truth
of
any
one's
pretensions
needed
only
a
clear
view
of
his
face
and
a
distinct
hearing
of
his
words
my
folly
in
that
respect
was
only
to
be
cured
however
by
my
own
experience
and
i
suppose
your
credulity
will
yield
to
no
other
remedy
these
are
the
facts--
mrs
wentworth
the
proprietor
of
the
house
in
which
welbeck
lived
has
furnished
some
intelligence
respecting
mervyn
whose
truth
cannot
be
doubted
and
which
furnishes
the
strongest
evidence
of
a
conspiracy
between
this
lad
and
his
employer
it
seems
that
some
years
since
a
nephew
of
this
lady
left
his
father's
family
clandestinely
and
has
not
been
heard
of
since
this
nephew
was
intended
to
inherit
her
fortunes
and
her
anxieties
and
inquiries
respecting
him
have
been
endless
and
incessant
these
however
have
been
fruitless
welbeck
knowing
these
circumstances
and
being
desirous
of
substituting
a
girl
whom
he
had
moulded
for
his
purpose
in
place
of
the
lost
youth
in
the
affections
of
the
lady
while
living
and
in
her
testament
when
dead
endeavoured
to
persuade
her
that
the
youth
had
died
in
some
foreign
country
for
this
end
mervyn
was
to
personate
a
kinsman
of
welbeck
who
had
just
arrived
from
europe
and
who
had
been
a
witness
of
her
nephew's
death
a
story
was
no
doubt
to
be
contrived
where
truth
should
be
copied
with
the
most
exquisite
dexterity
and
the
lady
being
prevailed
upon
to
believe
the
story
the
way
was
cleared
for
accomplishing
the
remainder
of
the
plot
in
due
time
and
after
the
lady's
mind
had
been
artfully
prepared
by
welbeck
the
pupil
made
his
appearance
and
in
a
conversation
full
of
studied
ambiguities
assured
the
lady
that
her
nephew
was
dead
for
the
present
he
declined
relating
the
particulars
of
his
death
and
displayed
a
constancy
and
intrepidity
in
resisting
her
entreaties
that
would
have
been
admirable
in
a
better
cause
before
she
had
time
to
fathom
this
painful
mystery
welbeck's
frauds
were
in
danger
of
detection
and
he
and
his
pupil
suddenly
disappeared
while
the
plot
was
going
forward
there
occurred
an
incident
which
the
plotters
had
not
foreseen
or
precluded
and
which
possibly
might
have
created
some
confusion
or
impediment
in
their
designs
a
bundle
was
found
one
night
in
the
street
consisting
of
some
coarse
clothes
and
containing
in
the
midst
of
it
the
miniature
portrait
of
mrs
wentworth's
nephew
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
one
of
that
lady's
friends
who
immediately
despatched
the
bundle
to
her
mervyn
in
his
interview
with
this
lady
spied
the
portrait
on
the
mantel-piece
led
by
some
freak
of
fancy
or
some
web
of
artifice
he
introduced
the
talk
respecting
her
nephew
by
boldly
claiming
it
as
his
but
when
the
mode
in
which
it
had
been
found
was
mentioned
he
was
disconcerted
and
confounded
and
precipitately
withdrew
this
conduct
and
the
subsequent
flight
of
the
lad
afforded
ground
enough
to
question
the
truth
of
his
intelligence
respecting
her
nephew
but
it
has
since
been
confuted
in
a
letter
just
received
from
her
brother
in
england
in
this
letter
she
is
informed
that
her
nephew
had
been
seen
by
one
who
knew
him
well
in
charleston
that
some
intercourse
took
place
between
the
youth
and
the
bearer
of
the
news
in
the
course
of
which
the
latter
had
persuaded
the
nephew
to
return
to
his
family
and
that
the
youth
had
given
some
tokens
of
compliance
the
letter-writer
who
was
father
to
the
fugitive
had
written
to
certain
friends
at
charleston
entreating
them
to
use
their
influence
with
the
runaway
to
the
same
end
and
at
any
rate
to
cherish
and
protect
him
thus
i
hope
you
will
admit
that
the
duplicity
of
mervyn
is
demonstrated
the
facts
which
you
have
mentioned
said
i
after
some
pause
partly
correspond
with
mervyn's
story
but
the
last
particular
is
irreconcilably
repugnant
to
it
now
for
the
first
time
i
begin
to
feel
that
my
confidence
is
shaken
i
feel
my
mind
bewildered
and
distracted
by
the
multitude
of
new
discoveries
which
have
just
taken
place
i
want
time
to
revolve
them
slowly
to
weigh
them
accurately
and
to
estimate
their
consequences
fully
i
am
afraid
to
speak
fearing
that
in
the
present
trouble
of
my
thoughts
i
may
say
something
which
i
may
afterwards
regret
i
want
a
counsellor
but
you
wortley
are
unfit
for
the
office
your
judgment
is
unfurnished
with
the
same
materials
your
sufferings
have
soured
your
humanity
and
biassed
your
candour
the
only
one
qualified
to
divide
with
me
these
cares
and
aid
in
selecting
the
best
mode
of
action
is
my
wife
she
is
mistress
of
mervyn's
history
an
observer
of
his
conduct
during
his
abode
with
us
and
is
hindered
by
her
education
and
temper
from
deviating
into
rigour
and
malevolence
will
you
pardon
me
therefore
if
i
defer
commenting
on
your
narrative
till
i
have
had
an
opportunity
of
reviewing
it
and
comparing
it
with
my
knowledge
of
the
lad
collected
from
himself
and
from
my
own
observation
wortley
could
not
but
admit
the
justice
of
my
request
and
after
some
desultory
conversation
we
parted
i
hastened
to
communicate
to
my
wife
the
various
intelligence
which
i
had
lately
received
mrs
althorpe's
portrait
of
the
mervyns
contained
lineaments
which
the
summary
detail
of
arthur
did
not
enable
us
fully
to
comprehend
the
treatment
which
the
youth
is
said
to
have
given
to
his
father
the
illicit
commerce
that
subsisted
between
him
and
his
father's
wife
the
pillage
of
money
and
his
father's
horse
but
ill
accorded
with
the
tale
which
we
had
heard
and
disquieted
our
minds
with
doubts
though
far
from
dictating
our
belief
what
however
more
deeply
absorbed
our
attention
was
the
testimony
of
williams
and
of
mrs
wentworth
that
which
was
mysterious
and
inscrutable
to
wortley
and
the
friends
of
watson
was
luminous
to
us
the
coincidence
between
the
vague
hints
laboriously
collected
by
these
inquirers
and
the
narrative
of
mervyn
afforded
the
most
cogent
attestation
of
the
truth
of
that
narrative
watson
had
vanished
from
all
eyes
but
the
spot
where
rested
his
remains
was
known
to
us
the
girdle
spoken
of
by
williams
would
not
be
suspected
to
exist
by
his
murderer
it
was
unmolested
and
was
doubtless
buried
with
him
that
which
was
so
earnestly
sought
and
which
constituted
the
subsistence
of
the
maurices
would
probably
be
found
adhering
to
his
body
what
conduct
was
incumbent
upon
me
who
possessed
this
knowledge
it
was
just
to
restore
these
bills
to
their
true
owner
but
how
could
this
be
done
without
hazardous
processes
and
tedious
disclosures
to
whom
ought
these
disclosures
to
be
made
by
what
authority
or
agency
could
these
half-decayed
limbs
be
dug
up
and
the
lost
treasure
be
taken
from
amidst
the
horrible
corruption
in
which
it
was
immersed
this
ought
not
to
be
the
act
of
a
single
individual
this
act
would
entangle
him
in
a
maze
of
perils
and
suspicions
of
concealments
and
evasions
from
which
he
could
not
hope
to
escape
with
his
reputation
inviolate
the
proper
method
was
through
the
agency
of
the
law
it
is
to
this
that
mervyn
must
submit
his
conduct
the
story
which
he
told
to
me
he
must
tell
to
the
world
suspicions
have
fixed
themselves
upon
him
which
allow
him
not
the
privilege
of
silence
and
obscurity
while
he
continued
unknown
and
unthought
of
the
publication
of
his
story
would
only
give
unnecessary
birth
to
dangers
but
now
dangers
are
incurred
which
it
may
probably
contribute
to
lessen
if
not
to
remove
meanwhile
the
return
of
mervyn
to
the
city
was
anxiously
expected
day
after
day
passed
and
no
tidings
were
received
i
had
business
of
an
urgent
nature
which
required
my
presence
in
jersey
but
which
in
the
daily
expectation
of
the
return
of
my
young
friend
i
postponed
a
week
longer
than
rigid
discretion
allowed
at
length
i
was
obliged
to
comply
with
the
exigence
and
left
the
city
but
made
such
arrangements
that
i
should
be
apprized
by
my
wife
of
mervyn's
return
with
all
practicable
expedition
these
arrangements
were
superfluous
for
my
business
was
despatched
and
my
absence
at
an
end
before
the
youth
had
given
us
any
tokens
of
his
approach
i
now
remembered
the
warnings
of
wortley
and
his
assertions
that
mervyn
had
withdrawn
himself
forever
from
our
view
the
event
had
hitherto
unwelcomely
coincided
with
these
predictions
and
a
thousand
doubts
and
misgivings
were
awakened
one
evening
while
preparing
to
shake
off
gloomy
thoughts
by
a
visit
to
a
friend
some
one
knocked
at
my
door
and
left
a
billet
containing
these
words--
dr
stevens
is
requested
to
come
immediately
to
the
debtors'
apartments
in
prune
street
this
billet
was
without
signature
the
handwriting
was
unknown
and
the
precipitate
departure
of
the
bearer
left
me
wholly
at
a
loss
with
respect
to
the
person
of
the
writer
or
the
end
for
which
my
presence
was
required
this
uncertainty
only
hastened
my
compliance
with
the
summons
the
evening
was
approaching--a
time
when
the
prison-doors
are
accustomed
to
be
shut
and
strangers
to
be
excluded
this
furnished
an
additional
reason
for
despatch
as
i
walked
swiftly
along
i
revolved
the
possible
motives
that
might
have
prompted
this
message
a
conjecture
was
soon
formed
which
led
to
apprehension
and
inquietude
one
of
my
friends
by
name
carlton
was
embarrassed
with
debts
which
he
was
unable
to
discharge
he
had
lately
been
menaced
with
arrest
by
a
creditor
not
accustomed
to
remit
any
of
his
claims
i
dreaded
that
this
catastrophe
had
now
happened
and
called
to
mind
the
anguish
with
which
this
untoward
incident
would
overwhelm
his
family
i
knew
his
incapacity
to
take
away
the
claim
of
his
creditor
by
payment
or
to
soothe
him
into
clemency
by
supplication
so
prone
is
the
human
mind
to
create
for
itself
distress
that
i
was
not
aware
of
the
uncertainty
of
this
evil
till
i
arrived
at
the
prison
i
checked
myself
at
the
moment
when
i
opened
my
lips
to
utter
the
name
of
my
friend
and
was
admitted
without
particular
inquiries
i
supposed
that
he
by
whom
i
had
been
summoned
hither
would
meet
me
in
the
common
room
the
apartment
was
filled
with
pale
faces
and
withered
forms
the
marks
of
negligence
and
poverty
were
visible
in
all
but
few
betrayed
in
their
features
or
gestures
any
symptoms
of
concern
on
account
of
their
condition
ferocious
gayety
or
stupid
indifference
seemed
to
sit
upon
every
brow
the
vapour
from
a
heated
stove
mingled
with
the
fumes
of
beer
and
tallow
that
were
spilled
upon
it
and
with
the
tainted
breath
of
so
promiscuous
a
crowd
loaded
the
stagnant
atmosphere
at
my
first
transition
from
the
cold
and
pure
air
without
to
this
noxious
element
i
found
it
difficult
to
breathe
a
moment
however
reconciled
me
to
my
situation
and
i
looked
anxiously
round
to
discover
some
face
which
i
knew
almost
every
mouth
was
furnished
with
a
cigar
and
every
hand
with
a
glass
of
porter
conversation
carried
on
with
much
emphasis
of
tone
and
gesture
was
not
wanting
sundry
groups
in
different
corners
were
beguiling
the
tedious
hours
at
whist
others
unemployed
were
strolling
to
and
fro
and
testified
their
vacancy
of
thought
and
care
by
humming
or
whistling
a
tune
i
fostered
the
hope
that
my
prognostics
had
deceived
me
this
hope
was
strengthened
by
reflecting
that
the
billet
received
was
written
in
a
different
hand
from
that
of
my
friend
meanwhile
i
continued
my
search
seated
on
a
bench
silent
and
aloof
from
the
crowd
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
and
his
face
half
concealed
by
his
hand
a
form
was
at
length
discovered
which
verified
all
my
conjectures
and
fears
carlton
was
he
my
heart
drooped
and
my
tongue
faltered
at
this
sight
i
surveyed
him
for
some
minutes
in
silence
at
length
approaching
the
bench
on
which
he
sat
i
touched
his
hand
and
awakened
him
from
his
reverie
he
looked
up
a
momentary
gleam
of
joy
and
surprise
was
succeeded
by
a
gloom
deeper
than
before
it
was
plain
that
my
friend
needed
consolation
he
was
governed
by
an
exquisite
sensibility
to
disgrace
he
was
impatient
of
constraint
he
shrunk
with
fastidious
abhorrence
from
the
contact
of
the
vulgar
and
the
profligate
his
constitution
was
delicate
and
feeble
impure
airs
restraint
from
exercise
unusual
aliment
unwholesome
or
incommodious
accommodations
and
perturbed
thoughts
were
at
any
time
sufficient
to
generate
disease
and
to
deprive
him
of
life
to
these
evils
he
was
now
subjected
he
had
no
money
wherewith
to
purchase
food
he
had
been
dragged
hither
in
the
morning
he
had
not
tasted
a
morsel
since
his
entrance
he
had
not
provided
a
bed
on
which
to
lie
or
inquired
in
what
room
or
with
what
companions
the
night
was
to
be
spent
fortitude
was
not
among
my
friend's
qualities
he
was
more
prone
to
shrink
from
danger
than
encounter
it
and
to
yield
to
the
flood
rather
than
sustain
it
but
it
is
just
to
observe
that
his
anguish
on
the
present
occasion
arose
not
wholly
from
selfish
considerations
his
parents
were
dead
and
two
sisters
were
dependent
on
him
for
support
one
of
these
was
nearly
of
his
own
age
the
other
was
scarcely
emerged
from
childhood
there
was
an
intellectual
as
well
as
a
personal
resemblance
between
my
friend
and
his
sisters
they
possessed
his
physical
infirmities
his
vehement
passions
and
refinements
of
taste
and
the
misery
of
his
condition
was
tenfold
increased
by
reflecting
on
the
feelings
which
would
be
awakened
in
them
by
the
knowledge
of
his
state
and
the
hardships
to
which
the
loss
of
his
succour
would
expose
them
it
was
not
in
my
power
to
release
my
friend
by
the
payment
of
his
debt
but
by
contracting
with
the
keeper
of
the
prison
for
his
board
i
could
save
him
from
famine
and
by
suitable
exertions
could
procure
him
lodging
as
convenient
as
the
time
would
admit
i
could
promise
to
console
and
protect
his
sisters
and
by
cheerful
tones
and
frequent
visits
dispel
some
part
of
the
evil
which
encompassed
him
after
the
first
surprise
had
subsided
he
inquired
by
what
accident
this
meeting
had
been
produced
conscious
of
my
incapacity
to
do
him
any
essential
service
and
unwilling
to
make
me
a
partaker
in
his
miseries
he
had
forborne
to
inform
me
of
his
condition
this
assurance
was
listened
to
with
some
wonder
i
showed
him
the
billet
it
had
not
been
written
by
him
he
was
a
stranger
to
the
penmanship
none
but
the
attorney
and
officer
were
apprized
of
his
fate
it
was
obvious
to
conclude
that
this
was
the
interposition
of
some
friend
who
knowing
my
affection
for
carlton
had
taken
this
mysterious
method
of
calling
me
to
his
succour
conjectures
as
to
the
author
and
motives
of
this
inter
position
were
suspended
by
more
urgent
considerations
i
requested
an
interview
with
the
keeper
and
inquired
how
carlton
could
be
best
accommodated
he
said
that
all
his
rooms
were
full
but
one
which
in
consequence
of
the
dismission
of
three
persons
in
the
morning
had
at
present
but
one
tenant
this
person
had
lately
arrived
was
sick
and
had
with
him
at
this
time
one
of
his
friends
carlton
might
divide
the
chamber
with
this
person
no
doubt
his
consent
would
be
readily
given
though
this
arrangement
being
the
best
must
take
place
whether
he
consented
or
not
this
consent
i
resolved
immediately
to
seek
and
for
that
purpose
desired
to
be
led
to
the
chamber
the
door
of
the
apartment
was
shut
i
knocked
for
admission
it
was
instantly
opened
and
i
entered
the
first
person
who
met
my
view
was--arthur
mervyn
i
started
with
astonishment
mervyn's
countenance
betrayed
nothing
but
satisfaction
at
the
interview
the
traces
of
fatigue
and
anxiety
gave
place
to
tenderness
and
joy
it
readily
occurred
to
me
that
mervyn
was
the
writer
of
the
note
which
i
had
lately
received
to
meet
him
within
these
walls
and
at
this
time
was
the
most
remote
and
undesirable
of
all
contingencies
the
same
hour
had
thus
made
me
acquainted
with
the
kindred
and
unwelcome
fate
of
two
beings
whom
i
most
loved
i
had
scarcely
time
to
return
his
embrace
when
taking
my
hand
he
led
me
to
a
bed
that
stood
in
one
corner
there
was
stretched
upon
it
one
whom
a
second
glance
enabled
me
to
call
by
his
name
though
i
had
never
before
seen
him
the
vivid
portrait
which
mervyn
had
drawn
was
conspicuous
in
the
sunken
and
haggard
visage
before
me
this
face
had
indeed
proportions
and
lines
which
could
never
be
forgotten
or
mistaken
welbeck
when
once
seen
or
described
was
easily
distinguished
from
the
rest
of
mankind
he
had
stronger
motives
than
other
men
for
abstaining
from
guilt
the
difficulty
of
concealment
or
disguise
being
tenfold
greater
in
him
than
in
others
by
reason
of
the
indelible
and
eye-attracting
marks
which
nature
had
set
upon
him
he
was
pallid
and
emaciated
he
did
not
open
his
eyes
on
my
entrance
he
seemed
to
be
asleep
but
before
i
had
time
to
exchange
glances
with
mervyn
or
to
inquire
into
the
nature
of
the
scene
he
awoke
on
seeing
me
he
started
and
cast
a
look
of
upbraiding
on
my
companion
the
latter
comprehended
his
emotion
and
endeavoured
to
appease
him
this
person
said
he
is
my
friend
he
is
likewise
a
physician
and
perceiving
your
state
to
require
medical
assistance
i
ventured
to
send
for
him
welbeck
replied
in
a
contemptuous
and
indignant
tone
thou
mistakest
my
condition
boy
my
disease
lies
deeper
than
his
scrutiny
will
ever
reach
i
had
hoped
thou
wert
gone
thy
importunities
are
well
meant
but
they
aggravate
my
miseries
he
now
rose
from
the
bed
and
continued
in
a
firm
and
resolute
tone
you
are
intruders
into
this
apartment
it
is
mine
and
i
desire
to
be
left
alone
mervyn
returned
at
first
no
answer
to
this
address
he
was
immersed
in
perplexity
at
length
raising
his
eyes
from
the
floor
he
said
my
intentions
are
indeed
honest
and
i
am
grieved
that
i
want
the
power
of
persuasion
to-morrow
perhaps
i
may
reason
more
cogently
with
your
despair
or
your
present
mood
may
be
changed
to
aid
my
own
weakness
i
will
entreat
the
assistance
of
this
friend
these
words
roused
a
new
spirit
in
welbeck
his
confusion
and
anger
increased
his
tongue
faltered
as
he
exclaimed
good
god
what
mean
you
headlong
and
rash
as
you
are
you
will
not
share
with
this
person
your
knowledge
of
me
here
he
checked
himself
conscious
that
the
words
he
had
already
uttered
tended
to
the
very
end
which
he
dreaded
this
consciousness
added
to
the
terror
of
more
ample
disclosures
which
the
simplicity
and
rectitude
of
mervyn
might
prompt
him
to
make
chained
up
his
tongue
and
covered
him
with
dismay
mervyn
was
not
long
in
answering--i
comprehend
your
fears
and
your
wishes
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
the
truth
to
this
person
your
story
has
already
been
told
whatever
i
have
witnessed
under
your
roof
whatever
i
have
heard
from
your
lips
have
been
faithfully
disclosed
to
him
the
countenance
of
welbeck
now
betrayed
a
mixture
of
incredulity
and
horror
for
a
time
his
utterance
was
stifled
by
his
complicated
feelings--
it
cannot
be
so
enormous
a
deed
is
beyond
thy
power
thy
qualities
are
marvellous
every
new
act
of
thine
outstrips
the
last
and
belies
the
newest
calculations
but
this--this
perfidy
exceeds--this
outrage
upon
promises
this
violation
of
faith
this
blindness
to
the
future
is
incredible
there
he
stopped
while
his
looks
seemed
to
call
upon
mervyn
for
a
contradiction
of
his
first
assertion
i
know
full
well
how
inexpiably
stupid
or
wicked
my
act
will
appear
to
you
but
i
will
not
prevaricate
or
lie
i
repeat
that
every
thing
is
known
to
him
your
birth
your
early
fortunes
the
incidents
at
charleston
and
wilmington
your
treatment
of
the
brother
and
sister
your
interview
with
watson
and
the
fatal
issue
of
that
interview--i
have
told
him
all
just
as
it
was
told
to
me
here
the
shock
that
was
felt
by
welbeck
overpowered
his
caution
and
his
strength
he
sunk
upon
the
side
of
the
bed
his
air
was
still
incredulous
and
he
continued
to
gaze
upon
mervyn
he
spoke
in
a
tone
less
vehement--
and
hast
thou
then
betrayed
me
hast
thou
shut
every
avenue
to
my
return
to
honour
am
i
known
to
be
a
seducer
and
assassin
to
have
meditated
all
crimes
and
to
have
perpetrated
the
worst
infamy
and
death
are
my
portion
i
know
they
are
reserved
for
me
but
i
did
not
think
to
receive
them
at
thy
hands
that
under
that
innocent
guise
there
lurked
a
heart
treacherous
and
cruel
but
go
leave
me
to
myself
this
stroke
has
exterminated
my
remnant
of
hope
leave
me
to
prepare
my
neck
for
the
halter
and
my
lips
for
this
last
and
bitterest
cup
mervyn
struggled
with
his
tears
and
replied
all
this
was
foreseen
and
all
this
i
was
prepared
to
endure
my
friend
and
i
will
withdraw
as
you
wish
but
to-morrow
i
return
not
to
vindicate
my
faith
or
my
humanity
not
to
make
you
recant
your
charges
or
forgive
the
faults
which
i
seem
to
have
committed
but
to
extricate
you
from
your
present
evil
or
to
arm
you
with
fortitude
so
saying
he
led
the
way
out
of
the
room
i
followed
him
in
silence
the
strangeness
and
abruptness
of
this
scene
left
me
no
power
to
assume
a
part
in
it
i
looked
on
with
new
and
indescribable
sensations
i
reached
the
street
before
my
recollection
was
perfectly
recovered
i
then
reflected
on
the
purpose
that
had
led
me
to
welbeck's
chamber
this
purpose
was
yet
unaccomplished
i
desired
mervyn
to
linger
a
moment
while
i
returned
into
the
house
i
once
more
inquired
for
the
keeper
and
told
him
i
should
leave
to
him
the
province
of
acquainting
welbeck
with
the
necessity
of
sharing
his
apartment
with
a
stranger
i
speedily
rejoined
mervyn
in
the
street
i
lost
no
time
in
requiring
an
explanation
of
the
scene
that
i
had
witnessed
how
became
you
once
more
the
companion
of
welbeck
why
did
you
not
inform
me
by
letter
of
your
arrival
at
malverton
and
of
what
occurred
during
your
absence
what
is
the
fate
of
mr
hadwin
and
of
wallace
alas
said
he
i
perceive
that
though
i
have
written
you
have
never
received
my
letters
the
tale
of
what
has
occurred
since
we
parted
is
long
and
various
i
am
not
only
willing
but
eager
to
communicate
the
story
but
this
is
no
suitable
place
have
patience
till
we
reach
your
house
i
have
involved
myself
in
perils
and
embarrassments
from
which
i
depend
upon
your
counsel
and
aid
to
release
me
i
had
scarcely
reached
my
own
door
when
i
was
overtaken
by
a
servant
whom
i
knew
to
belong
to
the
family
in
which
carlton
and
his
sisters
resided
her
message
therefore
was
readily
guessed
she
came
as
i
expected
to
inquire
for
my
friend
who
had
left
his
home
in
the
morning
with
a
stranger
and
had
not
yet
returned
his
absence
had
occasioned
some
inquietude
and
his
sister
had
sent
this
message
to
me
to
procure
what
information
respecting
the
cause
of
his
detention
i
was
able
to
give
my
perplexity
hindered
me
for
some
time
from
answering
i
was
willing
to
communicate
the
painful
truth
with
my
own
mouth
i
saw
the
necessity
of
putting
an
end
to
her
suspense
and
of
preventing
the
news
from
reaching
her
with
fallacious
aggravations
or
at
an
unseasonable
time
i
told
the
messenger
that
i
had
just
parted
with
mr
carlton
that
he
was
well
and
that
i
would
speedily
come
and
acquaint
his
sister
with
the
cause
of
his
absence
though
burning
with
curiosity
respecting
mervyn
and
welbeck
i
readily
postponed
its
gratification
till
my
visit
to
miss
carlton
was
performed
i
had
rarely
seen
this
lady
my
friendship
for
her
brother
though
ardent
having
been
lately
formed
and
chiefly
matured
by
interviews
at
my
house
i
had
designed
to
introduce
her
to
my
wife
but
various
accidents
had
hindered
the
execution
of
my
purpose
now
consolation
and
counsel
were
more
needed
than
ever
and
delay
or
reluctance
in
bestowing
it
would
have
been
in
a
high
degree
unpardonable
i
therefore
parted
with
mervyn
requesting
him
to
await
my
return
and
promising
to
perform
the
engagement
which
compelled
me
to
leave
him
with
the
utmost
despatch
on
entering
miss
carlton's
apartment
i
assumed
an
air
of
as
much
tranquillity
as
possible
i
found
the
lady
seated
at
a
desk
with
pen
in
hand
and
parchment
before
her
she
greeted
me
with
affectionate
dignity
and
caught
from
my
countenance
that
cheerfulness
of
which
on
my
entrance
she
was
destitute
you
come
said
she
to
inform
me
what
has
made
my
brother
a
truant
to-day
till
your
message
was
received
i
was
somewhat
anxious
this
day
he
usually
spends
in
rambling
through
the
fields
but
so
bleak
and
stormy
an
atmosphere
i
suppose
would
prevent
his
excursion
i
pray
sir
what
is
it
detains
him
to
conquer
my
embarrassment
and
introduce
the
subject
by
indirect
and
cautious
means
i
eluded
her
question
and
casting
an
eye
at
the
parchment--how
now
said
i
this
is
strange
employment
for
a
lady
i
knew
that
my
friend
pursued
this
trade
and
lived
by
binding
fast
the
bargains
which
others
made
but
i
knew
not
that
the
pen
was
ever
usurped
by
his
sister
the
usurpation
was
prompted
by
necessity
my
brother's
impatient
temper
and
delicate
frame
unfitted
him
for
the
trade
he
pursued
it
with
no
less
reluctance
than
diligence
devoting
to
the
task
three
nights
in
the
week
and
the
whole
of
each
day
it
would
long
ago
have
killed
him
had
i
not
bethought
myself
of
sharing
his
tasks
the
pen
was
irksome
and
toilsome
at
first
but
use
has
made
it
easy
and
far
more
eligible
than
the
needle
which
was
formerly
my
only
tool
this
arrangement
affords
my
brother
opportunities
of
exercise
and
recreation
without
diminishing
our
profits
and
my
time
though
not
less
constantly
is
more
agreeably
as
well
as
more
lucratively
employed
than
formerly
i
admire
your
reasoning
by
this
means
provision
is
made
against
untoward
accidents
if
sickness
should
disable
him
you
are
qualified
to
pursue
the
same
means
of
support
at
these
words
the
lady's
countenance
changed
she
put
her
hand
on
my
arm
and
said
in
a
fluttering
and
hurried
accent
is
my
brother
sick
no
he
is
in
perfect
health
my
observation
was
a
harmless
one
i
am
sorry
to
observe
your
readiness
to
draw
alarming
inferences
if
i
were
to
say
that
your
scheme
is
useful
to
supply
deficiencies
not
only
when
your
brother
is
disabled
by
sickness
but
when
thrown
by
some
inhuman
creditor
into
jail
no
doubt
you
would
perversely
and
hastily
infer
that
he
is
now
in
prison
i
had
scarcely
ended
the
sentence
when
the
piercing
eyes
of
the
lady
were
anxiously
fixed
upon
mine
after
a
moment's
pause
she
exclaimed
the
inference
indeed
is
too
plain
i
know
his
fate
it
has
long
been
foreseen
and
expected
and
i
have
summoned
up
my
equanimity
to
meet
it
would
to
heaven
he
may
find
the
calamity
as
light
as
i
should
find
it
but
i
fear
his
too
irritable
spirit
when
her
fears
were
confirmed
she
started
out
into
no
vehemence
of
exclamation
she
quickly
suppressed
a
few
tears
which
would
not
be
withheld
and
listened
to
my
narrative
of
what
had
lately
occurred
with
tokens
of
gratitude
formal
consolation
was
superfluous
her
mind
was
indeed
more
fertile
than
my
own
in
those
topics
which
take
away
its
keenest
edge
from
affliction
she
observed
that
it
was
far
from
being
the
heaviest
calamity
which
might
have
happened
the
creditor
was
perhaps
vincible
by
arguments
and
supplications
if
these
should
succeed
the
disaster
would
not
only
be
removed
but
that
security
from
future
molestation
be
gained
to
which
they
had
for
a
long
time
been
strangers
should
he
be
obdurate
their
state
was
far
from
being
hopeless
carlton's
situation
allowed
him
to
pursue
his
profession
his
gains
would
be
equal
and
his
expenses
would
not
be
augmented
by
their
mutual
industry
they
might
hope
to
amass
sufficient
to
discharge
the
debt
at
no
very
remote
period
what
she
chiefly
dreaded
was
the
pernicious
influence
of
dejection
and
sedentary
labour
on
her
brother's
health
yet
this
was
not
to
be
considered
as
inevitable
fortitude
might
be
inspired
by
exhortation
and
example
and
no
condition
precluded
us
from
every
species
of
bodily
exertion
the
less
inclined
he
should
prove
to
cultivate
the
means
of
deliverance
and
happiness
within
his
reach
the
more
necessary
it
became
for
her
to
stimulate
and
fortify
his
resolution
if
i
were
captivated
by
the
charms
of
this
lady's
person
and
carriage
my
reverence
was
excited
by
these
proofs
of
wisdom
and
energy
i
zealously
promised
to
concur
with
her
in
every
scheme
she
should
adopt
for
her
own
or
her
brother's
advantage
and
after
spending
some
hours
with
her
took
my
leave
i
now
regretted
the
ignorance
in
which
i
had
hitherto
remained
respecting
this
lady
that
she
was
in
an
eminent
degree
feminine
and
lovely
was
easily
discovered
but
intellectual
weakness
had
been
rashly
inferred
from
external
frailty
she
was
accustomed
to
shrink
from
observation
and
reserve
was
mistaken
for
timidity
i
called
on
carlton
only
when
numerous
engagements
would
allow
and
when
by
some
accident
his
customary
visits
had
been
intermitted
on
those
occasions
my
stay
was
short
and
my
attention
chiefly
confined
to
her
brother
i
now
resolved
to
atone
for
my
ancient
negligence
not
only
by
my
own
assiduities
but
by
those
of
my
wife
on
my
return
home
i
found
mervyn
and
my
wife
in
earnest
discourse
i
anticipated
the
shock
which
the
sensibility
of
the
latter
would
receive
from
the
tidings
which
i
had
to
communicate
respecting
carlton
i
was
unwilling
and
yet
perceived
the
necessity
of
disclosing
the
truth
i
desired
to
bring
these
women
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
knowledge
of
each
other
but
the
necessary
prelude
to
this
was
an
acquaintance
with
the
disaster
that
had
happened
scarcely
had
i
entered
the
room
when
mervyn
turned
to
me
and
said
with
an
air
of
anxiety
and
impatience
pray
my
friend
have
you
any
knowledge
of
francis
carlton
the
mention
of
this
name
by
mervyn
produced
some
surprise
i
acknowledged
my
acquaintance
with
him
do
you
know
in
what
situation
he
now
is
in
answer
to
this
question
i
stated
by
what
singular
means
his
situation
had
been
made
known
to
me
and
the
purpose
from
the
accomplishment
of
which
i
had
just
returned
i
inquired
in
my
turn
whence
originated
this
question
he
had
overheard
the
name
of
carlton
in
the
prison
two
persons
were
communing
in
a
corner
and
accident
enabled
him
to
catch
this
name
though
uttered
by
them
in
a
half
whisper
and
to
discover
that
the
person
talked
about
had
lately
been
conveyed
thither
this
name
was
not
now
heard
for
the
first
time
it
was
connected
with
remembrances
that
made
him
anxious
for
the
fate
of
him
to
whom
it
belonged
in
discourse
with
my
wife
this
name
chanced
to
be
again
mentioned
and
his
curiosity
was
roused
afresh
i
was
willing
to
communicate
all
that
i
knew
but
mervyn's
own
destiny
was
too
remarkable
not
to
absorb
all
my
attention
and
i
refused
to
discuss
any
other
theme
till
that
were
fully
explained
he
postponed
his
own
gratification
to
mine
and
consented
to
relate
the
incidents
that
had
happened
from
the
moment
of
our
separation
till
the
present
at
parting
with
you
my
purpose
was
to
reach
the
abode
of
the
hadwins
as
speedily
as
possible
i
travelled
therefore
with
diligence
setting
out
so
early
i
expected
though
on
foot
to
reach
the
end
of
my
journey
before
noon
the
activity
of
muscles
is
no
obstacle
to
thought
so
far
from
being
inconsistent
with
intense
musing
it
is
in
my
own
case
propitious
to
that
state
of
mind
probably
no
one
had
stronger
motives
for
ardent
meditation
than
i
my
second
journey
to
the
city
was
prompted
by
reasons
and
attended
by
incidents
that
seemed
to
have
a
present
existence
to
think
upon
them
was
to
view
more
deliberately
and
thoroughly
objects
and
persons
that
still
hovered
in
my
sight
instead
of
their
attributes
being
already
seen
and
their
consequences
at
an
end
it
seemed
as
if
a
series
of
numerous
years
and
unintermitted
contemplation
were
requisite
to
comprehend
them
fully
and
bring
into
existence
their
most
momentous
effects
if
men
be
chiefly
distinguished
from
each
other
by
the
modes
in
which
attention
is
employed
either
on
external
and
sensible
objects
or
merely
on
abstract
ideas
and
the
creatures
of
reflection
i
may
justly
claim
to
be
enrolled
in
the
second
class
my
existence
is
a
series
of
thoughts
rather
than
of
motions
ratiocination
and
deduction
leave
my
senses
unemployed
the
fulness
of
my
fancy
renders
my
eye
vacant
and
inactive
sensations
do
not
precede
and
suggest
but
follow
and
are
secondary
to
the
acts
of
my
mind
there
was
one
motive
however
which
made
me
less
inattentive
to
the
scene
that
was
continually
shifting
before
and
without
me
than
i
am
wont
to
be
the
loveliest
form
which
i
had
hitherto
seen
was
that
of
clemenza
lodi
i
recalled
her
condition
as
i
had
witnessed
it
as
welbeck
had
described
and
as
you
had
painted
it
the
past
was
without
remedy
but
the
future
was
in
some
degree
within
our
power
to
create
and
to
fashion
her
state
was
probably
dangerous
she
might
already
be
forlorn
beset
with
temptation
or
with
anguish
or
danger
might
only
be
approaching
her
and
the
worst
evils
be
impending
ones
i
was
ignorant
of
her
state
could
i
not
remove
this
ignorance
would
not
some
benefit
redound
to
her
from
beneficent
and
seasonable
interposition
you
had
mentioned
that
her
abode
had
lately
been
with
mrs
villars
and
that
this
lady
still
resided
in
the
country
the
residence
had
been
sufficiently
described
and
i
perceived
that
i
was
now
approaching
it
in
a
short
time
i
spied
its
painted
roof
and
five
chimneys
through
an
avenue
of
catalpas
when
opposite
the
gate
which
led
into
this
avenue
i
paused
it
seemed
as
if
this
moment
were
to
decide
upon
the
liberty
and
innocence
of
this
being
in
a
moment
i
might
place
myself
before
her
ascertain
her
true
condition
and
point
out
to
her
the
path
of
honour
and
safety
this
opportunity
might
be
the
last
longer
delay
might
render
interposition
fruitless
but
how
was
i
to
interpose
i
was
a
stranger
to
her
language
and
she
was
unacquainted
with
mine
to
obtain
access
to
her
it
was
necessary
only
to
demand
it
but
how
should
i
explain
my
views
and
state
my
wishes
when
an
interview
was
gained
and
what
expedient
was
it
in
my
power
to
propose
now
said
i
i
perceive
the
value
of
that
wealth
which
i
have
been
accustomed
to
despise
the
power
of
eating
and
drinking
the
nature
and
limits
of
existence
and
physical
enjoyment
are
not
changed
or
enlarged
by
the
increase
of
wealth
our
corporeal
and
intellectual
wants
are
supplied
at
little
expense
but
our
own
wants
are
the
wants
of
others
and
that
which
remains
after
our
own
necessities
are
obviated
it
is
always
easy
and
just
to
employ
in
relieving
the
necessities
of
others
there
are
no
superfluities
in
my
store
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
supply
this
unfortunate
girl
with
decent
raiment
and
honest
bread
i
have
no
house
to
which
to
conduct
her
i
have
no
means
of
securing
her
from
famine
and
cold
yet
though
indigent
and
feeble
i
am
not
destitute
of
friends
and
of
home
cannot
she
be
admitted
to
the
same
asylum
to
which
i
am
now
going
this
thought
was
sudden
and
new
the
more
it
was
revolved
the
more
plausible
it
seemed
this
was
not
merely
the
sole
expedient
but
the
best
that
could
have
been
suggested
the
hadwins
were
friendly
hospitable
unsuspicious
their
board
though
simple
and
uncouth
was
wholesome
and
plenteous
their
residence
was
sequestered
and
obscure
and
not
obnoxious
to
impertinent
inquiries
and
malignant
animadversion
their
frank
and
ingenuous
temper
would
make
them
easy
of
persuasion
and
their
sympathies
were
prompt
and
overflowing
i
am
nearly
certain
continued
i
that
they
will
instantly
afford
protection
to
this
desolate
girl
why
shall
i
not
anticipate
their
consent
and
present
myself
to
their
embraces
and
their
welcomes
in
her
company
slight
reflection
showed
me
that
this
precipitation
was
improper
whether
wallace
had
ever
arrived
at
malverton
whether
mr
hadwin
had
escaped
infection
whether
his
house
were
the
abode
of
security
and
quiet
or
a
scene
of
desolation
were
questions
yet
to
be
determined
the
obvious
and
best
proceeding
was
to
hasten
forward
to
afford
the
hadwins
if
in
distress
the
feeble
consolations
of
my
friendship
or
if
their
state
were
happy
to
procure
their
concurrence
to
my
scheme
respecting
clemenza
actuated
by
these
considerations
i
resumed
my
journey
looking
forward
i
perceived
a
chaise
and
horse
standing
by
the
left-hand
fence
at
the
distance
of
some
hundred
yards
this
object
was
not
uncommon
or
strange
and
therefore
it
was
scarcely
noticed
when
i
came
near
however
methought
i
recognised
in
this
carriage
the
same
in
which
my
importunities
had
procured
a
seat
for
the
languishing
wallace
in
the
manner
which
i
have
formerly
related
it
was
a
crazy
vehicle
and
old-fashioned
when
once
seen
it
could
scarcely
be
mistaken
or
forgotten
the
horse
was
held
by
his
bridle
to
a
post
but
the
seat
was
empty
my
solicitude
with
regard
to
wallace's
destiny
of
which
he
to
whom
the
carriage
belonged
might
possibly
afford
me
some
knowledge
made
me
stop
and
reflect
on
what
measures
it
was
proper
to
pursue
the
rider
could
not
be
at
a
great
distance
from
this
spot
his
absence
would
probably
be
short
by
lingering
a
few
minutes
an
interview
might
be
gained
and
the
uncertainty
and
suspense
of
some
hours
be
thereby
precluded
i
therefore
waited
and
the
same
person
whom
i
had
formerly
encountered
made
his
appearance
in
a
short
time
from
under
a
copse
that
skirted
the
road
he
recognised
me
with
more
difficulty
than
attended
my
recognition
of
him
the
circumstances
however
of
our
first
meeting
were
easily
recalled
to
his
remembrance
i
eagerly
inquired
when
and
where
he
had
parted
with
the
youth
who
had
been
on
that
occasion
intrusted
to
his
care
he
answered
that
on
leaving
the
city
and
inhaling
the
purer
air
of
the
fields
and
woods
wallace
had
been
in
a
wonderful
degree
invigorated
and
refreshed
an
instantaneous
and
total
change
appeared
to
have
been
wrought
in
him
he
no
longer
languished
with
fatigue
or
fear
but
became
full
of
gayety
and
talk
the
suddenness
of
this
transition
the
levity
with
which
he
related
and
commented
on
his
recent
dangers
and
evils
excited
the
astonishment
of
his
companion
to
whom
he
not
only
communicated
the
history
of
his
disease
but
imparted
many
anecdotes
of
a
humorous
kind
some
of
these
my
companion
repeated
i
heard
them
with
regret
and
dissatisfaction
they
betokened
a
mind
vitiated
by
intercourse
with
the
thoughtless
and
depraved
of
both
sexes
and
particularly
with
infamous
and
profligate
women
my
companion
proceeded
to
mention
that
wallace's
exhilaration
lasted
but
for
a
short
time
and
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
it
had
appeared
he
was
seized
with
deadly
sickness
and
insisted
upon
leaving
the
carriage
whose
movements
shocked
his
stomach
and
head
to
an
insupportable
degree
his
companion
was
not
void
of
apprehensions
on
his
own
account
but
was
unwilling
to
desert
him
and
endeavoured
to
encourage
him
his
efforts
were
vain
though
the
nearest
house
was
at
the
distance
of
some
hundred
yards
and
though
it
was
probable
that
the
inhabitants
of
this
house
would
refuse
to
accommodate
one
in
his
condition
yet
wallace
could
not
be
prevailed
on
to
proceed
and
in
spite
of
persuasion
and
remonstrance
left
the
carriage
and
threw
himself
on
the
grassy
bank
beside
the
road
this
person
was
not
unmindful
of
the
hazard
which
he
incurred
by
contact
with
a
sick
man
he
conceived
himself
to
have
performed
all
that
was
consistent
with
duty
to
himself
and
to
his
family
and
wallace
persisting
in
affirming
that
by
attempting
to
ride
farther
he
should
merely
hasten
his
death
was
at
length
left
to
his
own
guidance
these
were
unexpected
and
mournful
tidings
i
had
fondly
imagined
that
his
safety
was
put
beyond
the
reach
of
untoward
accidents
now
however
there
was
reason
to
suppose
him
to
have
perished
by
a
lingering
and
painful
disease
rendered
fatal
by
the
selfishness
of
mankind
by
the
want
of
seasonable
remedies
and
exposure
to
inclement
airs
some
uncertainty
however
rested
on
his
fate
it
was
my
duty
to
remove
it
and
to
carry
to
the
hadwins
no
mangled
and
defective
tale
where
i
asked
had
wallace
and
his
companion
parted
it
was
about
three
miles
farther
onward
the
spot
and
the
house
within
view
from
the
spot
were
accurately
described
in
this
house
it
was
possible
that
wallace
had
sought
an
asylum
and
some
intelligence
respecting
him
might
be
gained
from
its
inhabitants
my
informant
was
journeying
to
the
city
so
that
we
were
obliged
to
separate
in
consequence
of
this
man's
description
of
wallace's
deportment
and
the
proofs
of
a
dissolute
and
thoughtless
temper
which
he
had
given
i
began
to
regard
his
death
as
an
event
less
deplorable
such
a
one
was
unworthy
of
a
being
so
devoutly
pure
so
ardent
in
fidelity
and
tenderness
as
susan
hadwin
if
he
loved
it
was
probable
that
in
defiance
of
his
vows
he
would
seek
a
different
companion
if
he
adhered
to
his
first
engagements
his
motives
would
be
sordid
and
the
disclosure
of
his
latent
defects
might
produce
more
exquisite
misery
to
his
wife
than
his
premature
death
or
treacherous
desertion
the
preservation
of
this
man
was
my
sole
motive
for
entering
the
infected
city
and
subjecting
my
own
life
to
the
hazards
from
which
my
escape
may
almost
be
esteemed
miraculous
was
not
the
end
disproportioned
to
the
means
was
there
arrogance
in
believing
my
life
a
price
too
great
to
be
given
for
his
i
was
not
indeed
sorry
for
the
past
my
purpose
was
just
and
the
means
which
i
selected
were
the
best
my
limited
knowledge
supplied
my
happiness
should
be
drawn
from
reflecting
on
the
equity
of
my
intentions
that
these
intentions
were
frustrated
by
the
ignorance
of
others
or
my
own
was
the
consequence
of
human
frailty
honest
purposes
though
they
may
not
bestow
happiness
on
others
will
at
least
secure
it
to
him
who
fosters
them
by
these
reflections
my
regrets
were
dissipated
and
i
prepared
to
rejoice
alike
whether
wallace
should
be
found
to
have
escaped
or
to
have
perished
the
house
to
which
i
had
been
directed
was
speedily
brought
into
view
i
inquired
for
the
master
or
mistress
of
the
mansion
and
was
conducted
to
a
lady
of
a
plain
and
housewifely
appearance
my
curiosity
was
fully
gratified
wallace
whom
my
description
easily
identified
had
made
his
appearance
at
her
door
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
he
left
the
city
the
dread
of
the
fever
was
descanted
on
with
copious
and
rude
eloquence
i
supposed
her
eloquence
on
this
theme
to
be
designed
to
apologize
to
me
for
her
refusing
entrance
to
the
sick
man
the
peroration
however
was
different
wallace
was
admitted
and
suitable
attention
paid
to
his
wants
happily
the
guest
had
nothing
to
struggle
with
but
extreme
weakness
repose
nourishing
diet
and
salubrious
airs
restored
him
in
a
short
time
to
health
he
lingered
under
this
roof
for
three
weeks
and
then
without
any
professions
of
gratitude
or
offers
of
pecuniary
remuneration
or
information
of
the
course
which
he
determined
to
take
he
left
them
these
facts
added
to
that
which
i
had
previously
known
threw
no
advantageous
light
upon
the
character
of
wallace
it
was
obvious
to
conclude
that
he
had
gone
to
malverton
and
thither
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
me
from
following
him
perhaps
one
of
my
grossest
defects
is
a
precipitate
temper
i
choose
my
path
suddenly
and
pursue
it
with
impetuous
expedition
in
the
present
instance
my
resolution
was
conceived
with
unhesitating
zeal
and
i
walked
the
faster
that
i
might
the
sooner
execute
it
miss
hadwin
deserved
to
be
happy
love
was
in
her
heart
the
all-absorbing
sentiment
a
disappointment
there
was
a
supreme
calamity
depravity
and
folly
must
assume
the
guise
of
virtue
before
it
can
claim
her
affection
this
disguise
might
be
maintained
for
a
time
but
its
detection
must
inevitably
come
and
the
sooner
this
detection
takes
place
the
more
beneficial
it
must
prove
i
resolved
to
unbosom
myself
with
equal
and
unbounded
confidence
to
wallace
and
his
mistress
i
would
choose
for
this
end
not
the
moment
when
they
were
separate
but
that
in
which
they
were
together
my
knowledge
and
the
sources
of
my
knowledge
relative
to
wallace
should
be
unfolded
to
the
lady
with
simplicity
and
truth
the
lover
should
be
present
to
confute
to
extenuate
or
to
verify
the
charges
during
the
rest
of
the
day
these
images
occupied
the
chief
place
in
my
thoughts
the
road
was
miry
and
dark
and
my
journey
proved
to
be
more
tedious
and
fatiguing
than
i
expected
at
length
just
as
the
evening
closed
the
well-known
habitation
appeared
in
view
since
my
departure
winter
had
visited
the
world
and
the
aspect
of
nature
was
desolate
and
dreary
all
around
this
house
was
vacant
negligent
forlorn
the
contrast
between
these
appearances
and
those
which
i
had
noticed
on
my
first
approach
to
it
when
the
ground
and
the
trees
were
decked
with
the
luxuriance
and
vivacity
of
summer
was
mournful
and
seemed
to
foretoken
ill
my
spirits
drooped
as
i
noticed
the
general
inactivity
and
silence
i
entered
without
warning
the
door
that
led
into
the
parlour
no
face
was
to
be
seen
or
voice
heard
the
chimney
was
ornamented
as
in
summer
with
evergreen
shrubs
though
it
was
now
the
second
month
of
frost
and
snow
fire
did
not
appear
to
have
been
lately
kindled
on
this
hearth
this
was
a
circumstance
from
which
nothing
good
could
be
deduced
had
there
been
those
to
share
its
comforts
who
had
shared
them
on
former
years
this
was
the
place
and
hour
at
which
they
commonly
assembled
a
door
on
one
side
led
through
a
narrow
entry
into
the
kitchen
i
opened
this
door
and
passed
towards
the
kitchen
no
one
was
there
but
an
old
man
squatted
in
the
chimney-corner
his
face
though
wrinkled
denoted
undecayed
health
and
an
unbending
spirit
a
homespun
coat
leathern
breeches
wrinkled
with
age
and
blue
yarn
hose
were
well
suited
to
his
lean
and
shrivelled
form
on
his
right
knee
was
a
wooden
bowl
which
he
had
just
replenished
from
a
pipkin
of
hasty
pudding
still
smoking
on
the
coals
and
in
his
left
hand
a
spoon
which
he
had
at
that
moment
plunged
into
a
bottle
of
molasses
that
stood
beside
him
this
action
was
suspended
by
my
entrance
he
looked
up
and
exclaimed
heyday
who's
this
that
comes
into
other
people's
houses
without
so
much
as
saying
'by
your
leave'
what's
thee
business
who's
thee
want
i
had
never
seen
this
personage
before
i
supposed
it
to
be
some
new
domestic
and
inquired
for
mr
hadwin
ah
replied
he
with
a
sigh
william
hadwin
is
it
him
thee
wants
poor
man
he
is
gone
to
rest
many
days
since
my
heart
sunk
within
me
at
these
tidings
dead
said
i
do
you
mean
that
he
is
dead--this
exclamation
was
uttered
in
a
tone
of
some
vehemence
it
attracted
the
attention
of
some
one
who
was
standing
without
who
immediately
entered
the
kitchen
it
was
eliza
hadwin
the
moment
she
beheld
me
she
shrieked
aloud
and
rushing
into
my
arms
fainted
away
the
old
man
dropped
his
bowl
and
starting
from
his
seat
stared
alternately
at
me
and
at
the
breathless
girl
my
emotion
made
up
of
joy
and
sorrow
and
surprise
rendered
me
for
a
moment
powerless
as
she
at
length
he
said
i
understand
this
i
know
who
thee
is
and
will
tell
her
thee's
come
so
saying
he
hastily
left
the
room
in
a
short
time
this
gentle
girl
recovered
her
senses
she
did
not
withdraw
herself
from
my
sustaining
arm
but
leaning
on
my
bosom
she
resigned
herself
to
passionate
weeping
i
did
not
endeavour
to
check
this
effusion
believing
that
its
influence
would
be
salutary
i
had
not
forgotten
the
thrilling
sensibility
and
artless
graces
of
this
girl
i
had
not
forgotten
the
scruples
which
had
formerly
made
me
check
a
passion
whose
tendency
was
easily
discovered
these
new
proofs
of
her
affection
were
at
once
mournful
and
delightful
the
untimely
fate
of
her
father
and
my
friend
pressed
with
new
force
upon
my
heart
and
my
tears
in
spite
of
my
fortitude
mingled
with
hers
the
attention
of
both
was
presently
attracted
by
a
faint
scream
which
proceeded
from
above
immediately
tottering
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
passage
and
a
figure
rushed
into
the
room
pale
emaciated
haggard
and
wild
she
cast
a
piercing
glance
at
me
uttered
a
feeble
exclamation
and
sunk
upon
the
floor
without
signs
of
life
it
was
not
difficult
to
comprehend
this
scene
i
now
conjectured
what
subsequent
inquiry
confirmed
that
the
old
man
had
mistaken
me
for
wallace
and
had
carried
to
the
elder
sister
the
news
of
his
return
this
fatal
disappointment
of
hopes
that
had
nearly
been
extinct
and
which
were
now
so
powerfully
revived
could
not
be
endured
by
a
frame
verging
to
dissolution
this
object
recalled
all
the
energies
of
eliza
and
engrossed
all
my
solicitude
i
lifted
the
fallen
girl
in
my
arms
and
guided
by
her
sister
carried
her
to
her
chamber
i
had
now
leisure
to
contemplate
the
changes
which
a
few
months
had
made
in
this
lovely
frame
i
turned
away
from
the
spectacle
with
anguish
but
my
wandering
eyes
were
recalled
by
some
potent
fascination
and
fixed
in
horror
upon
a
form
which
evinced
the
last
stage
of
decay
eliza
knelt
on
one
side
and
leaning
her
face
upon
the
bed
endeavoured
in
vain
to
smother
her
sobs
i
sat
on
the
other
motionless
and
holding
the
passive
and
withered
hand
of
the
sufferer
i
watched
with
ineffable
solicitude
the
return
of
life
it
returned
at
length
but
merely
to
betray
symptoms
that
it
would
speedily
depart
forever
for
a
time
my
faculties
were
palsied
and
i
was
made
an
impotent
spectator
of
the
ruin
that
environed
me
this
pusillanimity
quickly
gave
way
to
resolutions
and
reflections
better
suited
to
the
exigencies
of
the
time
the
first
impulse
was
to
summon
a
physician
but
it
was
evident
that
the
patient
had
been
sinking
by
slow
degrees
to
this
state
and
that
the
last
struggle
had
begun
nothing
remained
but
to
watch
her
while
expiring
and
perform
for
her
when
dead
the
rites
of
interment
the
survivor
was
capable
of
consolation
and
of
succour
i
went
to
her
and
drew
her
gently
into
another
apartment
the
old
man
tremulous
and
wonder-struck
seemed
anxious
to
perform
some
service
i
directed
him
to
kindle
a
fire
in
eliza's
chamber
meanwhile
i
persuaded
my
gentle
friend
to
remain
in
this
chamber
and
resign
to
me
the
performance
of
every
office
which
her
sister's
condition
required
i
sat
beside
the
bed
of
the
dying
till
the
mortal
struggle
was
past
i
perceived
that
the
house
had
no
inhabitant
besides
the
two
females
and
the
old
man
i
went
in
search
of
the
latter
and
found
him
crouched
as
before
at
the
kitchen-fire
smoking
his
pipe
i
placed
myself
on
the
same
bench
and
entered
into
conversation
with
him
i
gathered
from
him
that
he
had
for
many
years
been
mr
hadwin's
servant
that
lately
he
had
cultivated
a
small
farm
in
this
neighbourhood
for
his
own
advantage
stopping
one
day
in
october
at
the
tavern
he
heard
that
his
old
master
had
lately
been
in
the
city
had
caught
the
fever
and
after
his
return
had
died
with
it
the
moment
he
became
sick
his
servants
fled
from
the
house
and
the
neighbours
refused
to
approach
it
the
task
of
attending
his
sick-bed
was
allotted
to
his
daughters
and
it
was
by
their
hands
that
his
grave
was
dug
and
his
body
covered
with
earth
the
same
terror
of
infection
existed
after
his
death
as
before
and
these
hapless
females
were
deserted
by
all
mankind
old
caleb
was
no
sooner
informed
of
these
particulars
than
he
hurried
to
the
house
and
had
since
continued
in
their
service
his
heart
was
kind
but
it
was
easily
seen
that
his
skill
extended
only
to
execute
the
directions
of
another
grief
for
the
death
of
wallace
and
her
father
preyed
upon
the
health
of
the
eldest
daughter
the
younger
became
her
nurse
and
caleb
was
always
at
hand
to
execute
any
orders
the
performance
of
which
was
on
a
level
with
his
understanding
their
neighbours
had
not
withheld
their
good
offices
but
they
were
still
terrified
and
estranged
by
the
phantoms
of
pestilence
during
the
last
week
susan
had
been
too
weak
to
rise
from
her
bed
yet
such
was
the
energy
communicated
by
the
tidings
that
wallace
was
alive
and
had
returned
that
she
leaped
upon
her
feet
and
rushed
down-stairs
how
little
did
that
man
deserve
so
strenuous
and
immortal
an
affection
i
would
not
allow
myself
to
ponder
on
the
sufferings
of
these
women
i
endeavoured
to
think
only
of
the
best
expedients
for
putting
an
end
to
these
calamities
after
a
moment's
deliberation
i
determined
to
go
to
a
house
at
some
miles'
distance
the
dwelling
of
one
who
though
not
exempt
from
the
reigning
panic
had
shown
more
generosity
towards
these
unhappy
girls
than
others
during
my
former
abode
in
this
district
i
had
ascertained
his
character
and
found
him
to
be
compassionate
and
liberal
overpowered
by
fatigue
and
watching
eliza
was
no
sooner
relieved
by
my
presence
of
some
portion
of
her
cares
than
she
sunk
into
profound
slumber
i
directed
caleb
to
watch
the
house
till
my
return
which
should
be
before
midnight
and
then
set
out
for
the
dwelling
of
mr
ellis
the
weather
was
temperate
and
moist
and
rendered
the
footing
of
the
meadows
extremely
difficult
the
ground
that
had
lately
been
frozen
and
covered
with
snow
was
now
changed
into
gullies
and
pools
and
this
was
no
time
to
be
fastidious
in
the
choice
of
paths
a
brook
swelled
by
the
recent
thaw
was
likewise
to
be
passed
the
rail
which
i
had
formerly
placed
over
it
by
way
of
bridge
had
disappeared
and
i
was
obliged
to
wade
through
it
at
length
i
approached
the
house
to
which
i
was
going
at
so
late
an
hour
farmers
and
farmers'
servants
are
usually
abed
and
their
threshold
is
intrusted
to
their
watch-dogs
two
belonged
to
mr
ellis
whose
ferocity
and
vigilance
were
truly
formidable
to
a
stranger
but
i
hoped
that
in
me
they
would
recognise
an
old
acquaintance
and
suffer
me
to
approach
in
this
i
was
not
mistaken
though
my
person
could
not
be
distinctly
seen
by
starlight
they
seemed
to
scent
me
from
afar
and
met
me
with
a
thousand
caresses
approaching
the
house
i
perceived
that
its
tenants
were
retired
to
their
repose
this
i
expected
and
hastened
to
awaken
mr
ellis
by
knocking
briskly
at
the
door
presently
he
looked
out
of
a
window
above
and
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
in
which
impatience
at
being
so
unseasonably
disturbed
was
mingled
with
anxiety
i
told
him
my
name
and
entreated
him
to
come
down
and
allow
me
a
few
minutes'
conversation
he
speedily
dressed
himself
and
opening
the
kitchen
door
we
seated
ourselves
before
the
fire
my
appearance
was
sufficiently
adapted
to
excite
his
wonder
he
had
heard
of
my
elopement
from
the
house
of
mr
hadwin
he
was
a
stranger
to
the
motives
that
prompted
my
departure
and
to
the
events
that
had
befallen
me
and
no
interview
was
more
distant
from
his
expectations
than
the
present
his
curiosity
was
written
in
his
features
but
this
was
no
time
to
gratify
his
curiosity
the
end
that
i
now
had
in
view
was
to
procure
accommodation
for
eliza
hadwin
in
this
man's
house
for
this
purpose
it
was
my
duty
to
describe
with
simplicity
and
truth
the
inconveniences
which
at
present
surrounded
her
and
to
relate
all
that
had
happened
since
my
arrival
i
perceived
that
my
tale
excited
his
compassion
and
i
continued
with
new
zeal
to
paint
to
him
the
helplessness
of
this
girl
the
death
of
her
father
and
sister
left
her
the
property
of
this
farm
her
sex
and
age
disqualified
her
for
superintending
the
harvest-field
and
the
threshing-floor
and
no
expedient
was
left
but
to
lease
the
land
to
another
and
taking
up
her
abode
in
the
family
of
some
kinsman
or
friend
to
subsist
as
she
might
easily
do
upon
the
rent
meanwhile
her
continuance
in
this
house
was
equally
useless
and
dangerous
and
i
insinuated
to
my
companion
the
propriety
of
immediately
removing
her
to
his
own
some
hesitation
and
reluctance
appeared
in
him
which
i
immediately
ascribed
to
an
absurd
dread
of
infection
i
endeavoured
by
appealing
to
his
reason
as
well
as
to
his
pity
to
conquer
this
dread
i
pointed
out
the
true
cause
of
the
death
of
the
elder
daughter
and
assured
him
the
youngest
knew
no
indisposition
but
that
which
arose
from
distress
i
offered
to
save
him
from
any
hazard
that
might
attend
his
approaching
the
house
by
accompanying
her
hither
myself
all
that
her
safety
required
was
that
his
doors
should
not
be
shut
against
her
when
she
presented
herself
before
them
still
he
was
fearful
and
reluctant
and
at
length
mentioned
that
her
uncle
resided
not
more
than
sixteen
miles
farther
that
he
was
her
natural
protector
and
he
dared
to
say
would
find
no
difficulty
in
admitting
her
into
his
house
for
his
part
there
might
be
reason
in
what
i
said
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
think
but
that
there
was
still
some
danger
of
the
fever
it
was
right
to
assist
people
in
distress
to-be-sure
but
to
risk
his
own
life
he
did
not
think
to
be
his
duty
he
was
no
relation
of
the
family
and
it
was
the
duty
of
relations
to
help
each
other
her
uncle
was
the
proper
person
to
assist
her
and
no
doubt
he
would
be
as
willing
as
able
the
marks
of
dubiousness
and
indecision
which
accompanied
these
words
encouraged
me
in
endeavouring
to
subdue
his
scruples
the
increase
of
his
aversion
to
my
scheme
kept
pace
with
my
remonstrances
and
he
finally
declared
that
he
would
on
no
account
consent
to
it
ellis
was
by
no
means
hard
of
heart
his
determination
did
not
prove
the
coldness
of
his
charity
but
merely
the
strength
of
his
fears
he
was
himself
an
object
more
of
compassion
than
of
anger
and
he
acted
like
the
man
whose
fear
of
death
prompts
him
to
push
his
companion
from
the
plank
which
saved
him
from
drowning
but
which
is
unable
to
sustain
both
finding
him
invincible
to
my
entreaties
i
thought
upon
the
expedient
which
he
suggested
of
seeking
the
protection
of
her
uncle
it
was
true
that
the
loss
of
parents
had
rendered
her
uncle
her
legal
protector
his
knowledge
of
the
world
his
house
and
property
and
influence
would
perhaps
fit
him
for
this
office
in
a
more
eminent
degree
than
i
was
fitted
to
seek
a
different
asylum
might
indeed
be
unjust
to
both
and
after
some
reflection
i
not
only
dismissed
the
regret
which
ellis's
refusal
had
given
me
but
even
thanked
him
for
the
intelligence
and
counsel
which
he
had
afforded
me
i
took
leave
of
him
and
hastened
back
to
hadwin's
eliza
by
caleb's
report
was
still
asleep
there
was
no
urgent
necessity
for
awakening
her
but
something
was
forthwith
to
be
done
with
regard
to
the
unhappy
girl
that
was
dead
the
proceeding
incumbent
on
us
was
obvious
all
that
remained
was
to
dig
a
grave
and
to
deposit
the
remains
with
as
much
solemnity
and
decency
as
the
time
would
permit
there
were
two
methods
of
doing
this
i
might
wait
till
the
next
day
till
a
coffin
could
be
made
and
conveyed
hither
till
the
woman
whose
trade
it
was
to
make
and
put
on
the
habiliments
assigned
by
custom
to
the
dead
could
be
sought
out
and
hired
to
attend
till
kindred
friends
and
neighbours
could
be
summoned
to
the
obsequies
till
a
carriage
were
provided
to
remove
the
body
to
a
burying-ground
belonging
to
a
meeting-house
and
five
miles
distant
till
those
whose
trade
it
was
to
dig
graves
had
prepared
one
within
the
sacred
enclosure
for
her
reception
or
neglecting
this
toilsome
tedious
and
expensive
ceremonial
i
might
seek
the
grave
of
hadwin
and
lay
the
daughter
by
the
side
of
her
parent
perhaps
i
was
strong
in
my
preference
of
the
latter
mode
the
customs
of
burial
may
in
most
cases
be
in
themselves
proper
if
the
customs
be
absurd
yet
it
may
be
generally
proper
to
adhere
to
them
but
doubtless
there
are
cases
in
which
it
is
our
duty
to
omit
them
i
conceived
the
present
case
to
be
such
a
one
the
season
was
bleak
and
inclement
much
time
labour
and
expense
would
be
required
to
go
through
the
customary
rites
there
was
none
but
myself
to
perform
these
and
i
had
not
the
suitable
means
the
misery
of
eliza
would
only
be
prolonged
by
adhering
to
these
forms
and
her
fortune
be
needlessly
diminished
by
the
expenses
unavoidably
to
be
incurred
after
musing
upon
these
ideas
for
some
time
i
rose
from
my
seat
and
desired
caleb
to
follow
me
we
proceeded
to
an
outer
shed
where
farmers'
tools
used
to
be
kept
i
supplied
him
and
myself
with
a
spade
and
requested
him
to
lead
me
to
the
spot
where
mr
hadwin
was
laid
he
betrayed
some
hesitation
to
comply
and
appeared
struck
with
some
degree
of
alarm
as
if
my
purpose
had
been
to
molest
instead
of
securing
the
repose
of
the
dead
i
removed
his
doubts
by
explaining
my
intentions
but
he
was
scarcely
less
shocked
on
discovering
the
truth
than
he
had
been
alarmed
by
his
first
suspicions
he
stammered
out
his
objections
to
my
scheme
there
was
but
one
mode
of
burial
he
thought
that
was
decent
and
proper
and
he
could
not
be
free
to
assist
me
in
pursuing
any
other
mode
perhaps
caleb's
aversion
to
the
scheme
might
have
been
easily
overcome
but
i
reflected
that
a
mind
like
his
was
at
once
flexible
and
obstinate
he
might
yield
to
arguments
and
entreaties
and
act
by
their
immediate
impulse
but
the
impulse
passed
away
in
a
moment
old
and
habitual
convictions
were
resumed
and
his
deviation
from
the
beaten
track
would
be
merely
productive
of
compunction
his
aid
on
the
present
occasion
though
of
some
use
was
by
no
means
indispensable
i
forbore
to
solicit
his
concurrence
or
even
to
vanquish
the
scruples
he
entertained
against
directing
me
to
the
grave
of
hadwin
it
was
a
groundless
superstition
that
made
one
spot
more
suitable
for
this
purpose
than
another
i
desired
caleb
in
a
mild
tone
to
return
to
the
kitchen
and
leave
me
to
act
as
i
thought
proper
i
then
proceeded
to
the
orchard
one
corner
of
this
field
was
somewhat
above
the
level
of
the
rest
the
tallest
tree
of
the
group
grew
there
and
there
i
had
formerly
placed
a
bench
and
made
it
my
retreat
at
periods
of
leisure
it
had
been
recommended
by
its
sequestered
situation
its
luxuriant
verdure
and
profound
quiet
on
one
side
was
a
potato-field
on
the
other
a
melon-patch
and
before
me
in
rows
some
hundreds
of
apple-trees
here
i
was
accustomed
to
seek
the
benefits
of
contemplation
and
study
the
manuscripts
of
lodi
a
few
months
had
passed
since
i
had
last
visited
this
spot
what
revolutions
had
since
occurred
and
how
gloomily
contrasted
was
my
present
purpose
with
what
had
formerly
led
me
hither
in
this
spot
i
had
hastily
determined
to
dig
the
grave
of
susan
the
grave
was
dug
all
that
i
desired
was
a
cavity
of
sufficient
dimensions
to
receive
her
this
being
made
i
returned
to
the
house
lifted
the
corpse
in
my
arms
and
bore
it
without
delay
to
the
spot
caleb
seated
in
the
kitchen
and
eliza
asleep
in
her
chamber
were
wholly
unapprized
of
my
motions
the
grave
was
covered
the
spade
reposited
under
the
shed
and
my
seat
by
the
kitchen-fire
resumed
in
a
time
apparently
too
short
for
so
solemn
and
momentous
a
transaction
i
look
back
upon
this
incident
with
emotions
not
easily
described
it
seems
as
if
i
acted
with
too
much
precipitation
as
if
insensibility
and
not
reason
had
occasioned
that
clearness
of
conceptions
and
bestowed
that
firmness
of
muscles
which
i
then
experienced
i
neither
trembled
nor
wavered
in
my
purpose
i
bore
in
my
arms
the
being
whom
i
had
known
and
loved
through
the
whistling
gale
and
intense
darkness
of
a
winter's
night
i
heaped
earth
upon
her
limbs
and
covered
them
from
human
observation
without
fluctuations
or
tremors
though
not
without
feelings
that
were
awful
and
sublime
perhaps
some
part
of
my
steadfastness
was
owing
to
my
late
experience
and
some
minds
may
be
more
easily
inured
to
perilous
emergencies
than
others
if
reason
acquires
strength
only
by
the
diminution
of
sensibility
perhaps
it
is
just
for
sensibility
to
be
diminished
the
safety
of
eliza
was
the
object
that
now
occupied
my
cares
to
have
slept
after
her
example
had
been
most
proper
but
my
uncertainty
with
regard
to
her
fate
and
my
desire
to
conduct
her
to
some
other
home
kept
my
thoughts
in
perpetual
motion
i
waited
with
impatience
till
she
should
awake
and
allow
me
to
consult
with
her
on
plans
for
futurity
her
sleep
terminated
not
till
the
next
day
had
arisen
having
recovered
the
remembrance
of
what
had
lately
happened
she
inquired
for
her
sister
she
wanted
to
view
once
more
the
face
and
kiss
the
lips
of
her
beloved
susan
some
relief
to
her
anguish
she
expected
to
derive
from
this
privilege
when
informed
of
the
truth
when
convinced
that
susan
had
disappeared
forever
she
broke
forth
into
fresh
passion
it
seemed
as
if
her
loss
was
not
hopeless
or
complete
as
long
as
she
was
suffered
to
behold
the
face
of
her
friend
and
to
touch
her
lips
she
accused
me
of
acting
without
warrant
and
without
justice
of
defrauding
her
of
her
dearest
and
only
consolation
and
of
treating
her
sister's
sacred
remains
with
barbarous
indifference
and
rudeness
i
explained
in
the
gentlest
terms
the
reasons
of
my
conduct
i
was
not
surprised
or
vexed
that
she
at
first
treated
them
as
futile
and
as
heightening
my
offence
such
was
the
impulse
of
a
grief
which
was
properly
excited
by
her
loss
to
be
tranquil
and
steadfast
in
the
midst
of
the
usual
causes
of
impetuosity
and
agony
is
either
the
prerogative
of
wisdom
that
sublimes
itself
above
all
selfish
considerations
or
the
badge
of
giddy
and
unfeeling
folly
the
torrent
was
at
length
exhausted
upbraiding
was
at
an
end
and
gratitude
and
tenderness
and
implicit
acquiescence
in
any
scheme
which
my
prudence
should
suggest
succeeded
i
mentioned
her
uncle
as
one
to
whom
it
would
be
proper
in
her
present
distress
to
apply
she
started
and
betrayed
uneasiness
at
this
name
it
was
evident
that
she
by
no
means
concurred
with
me
in
my
notions
of
propriety
that
she
thought
with
aversion
of
seeking
her
uncle's
protection
i
requested
her
to
state
her
objections
to
this
scheme
or
to
mention
any
other
which
she
thought
preferable
she
knew
nobody
she
had
not
a
friend
in
the
world
but
myself
she
had
never
been
out
of
her
father's
house
she
had
no
relation
but
her
uncle
philip
and
he--she
could
not
live
with
him
i
must
not
insist
upon
her
going
to
his
house
it
was
not
the
place
for
her
she
should
never
be
happy
there
i
was
at
first
inclined
to
suspect
in
my
friend
some
capricious
and
groundless
antipathy
i
desired
her
to
explain
what
in
her
uncle's
character
made
him
so
obnoxious
she
refused
to
be
more
explicit
and
persisted
in
thinking
that
his
house
was
no
suitable
abode
for
her
finding
her
in
this
respect
invincible
i
sought
for
some
other
expedient
might
she
not
easily
be
accommodated
as
a
boarder
in
the
city
or
some
village
or
in
a
remote
quarter
of
the
country
ellis
her
nearest
and
most
opulent
neighbour
had
refused
to
receive
her
but
there
were
others
who
had
not
his
fears
there
were
others
within
the
compass
of
a
day's
journey
who
were
strangers
to
the
cause
of
hadwin's
death
but
would
it
not
be
culpable
to
take
advantage
of
that
ignorance
their
compliance
ought
not
to
be
the
result
of
deception
while
thus
engaged
the
incidents
of
my
late
journey
recurred
to
my
remembrance
and
i
asked
is
not
the
honest
woman
who
entertained
wallace
just
such
a
person
as
that
of
whom
i
am
in
search
her
treatment
of
wallace
shows
her
to
be
exempt
from
chimerical
fears
proves
that
she
has
room
in
her
house
for
an
occasional
inmate
encouraged
by
these
views
i
told
my
weeping
companion
that
i
had
recollected
a
family
in
which
she
would
be
kindly
treated
and
that
if
she
chose
we
would
not
lose
a
moment
in
repairing
thither
horses
belonging
to
the
farm
grazed
in
the
meadows
and
a
couple
of
these
would
carry
us
in
a
few
hours
to
the
place
which
i
had
selected
for
her
residence
on
her
eagerly
assenting
to
this
proposal
i
inquired
in
whose
care
and
in
what
state
our
present
habitation
should
be
left
the
father's
property
now
belonged
to
the
daughter
eliza's
mind
was
quick
active
and
sagacious
but
her
total
inexperience
gave
her
sometimes
the
appearance
of
folly
she
was
eager
to
fly
from
this
house
and
to
resign
herself
and
her
property
without
limitation
or
condition
to
my
control
our
intercourse
had
been
short
but
she
relied
on
my
protection
and
counsel
as
absolutely
as
she
had
been
accustomed
to
do
upon
her
father's
she
knew
not
what
answer
to
make
to
my
inquiry
whatever
i
pleased
to
do
was
the
best
what
did
i
think
ought
to
be
done
ah
thought
i
sweet
artless
and
simple
girl
how
wouldst
thou
have
fared
if
heaven
had
not
sent
me
to
thy
succour
there
are
beings
in
the
world
who
would
make
a
selfish
use
of
thy
confidence
who
would
beguile
thee
at
once
of
innocence
and
property
such
am
not
i
thy
welfare
is
a
precious
deposit
and
no
father
or
brother
could
watch
over
it
with
more
solicitude
than
i
will
do
i
was
aware
that
mr
hadwin
might
have
fixed
the
destination
of
his
property
and
the
guardianship
of
his
daughters
by
will
on
suggesting
this
to
my
friend
it
instantly
reminded
her
of
an
incident
that
took
place
after
his
last
return
from
the
city
he
had
drawn
up
his
will
and
gave
it
into
susan's
possession
who
placed
it
in
a
drawer
whence
it
was
now
taken
by
my
friend
by
this
will
his
property
was
now
found
to
be
bequeathed
to
his
two
daughters
and
his
brother
philip
hadwin
was
named
executor
and
guardian
to
his
daughters
till
they
should
be
twenty
years
old
this
name
was
no
sooner
heard
by
my
friend
than
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
affright
executor
my
uncle
what
is
that
what
power
does
that
give
him
i
know
not
exactly
the
power
of
executors
he
will
doubtless
have
possession
of
your
property
till
you
are
twenty
years
of
age
your
person
will
likewise
be
under
his
care
till
that
time
must
he
decide
where
i
am
to
live
he
is
vested
with
all
the
power
of
a
father
this
assurance
excited
the
deepest
consternation
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
ground
and
was
lost
for
a
time
in
the
deepest
reverie
recovering
at
length
she
said
with
a
sigh
what
if
my
father
had
made
no
will
in
that
case
a
guardian
could
not
be
dispensed
with
but
the
right
of
naming
him
would
belong
to
yourself
and
my
uncle
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
my
affairs
i
am
no
lawyer
said
i
but
i
presume
all
authority
over
your
person
and
property
would
devolve
upon
the
guardian
of
your
own
choice
then
i
am
free
saying
this
with
a
sudden
motion
she
tore
in
several
pieces
the
will
which
during
this
dialogue
she
had
held
in
her
hand
and
threw
the
fragments
into
the
fire
no
action
was
more
unexpected
to
me
than
this
my
astonishment
hindered
me
from
attempting
to
rescue
the
paper
from
the
flames
it
was
consumed
in
a
moment
i
was
at
a
loss
in
what
manner
to
regard
this
sacrifice
it
denoted
a
force
of
mind
little
in
unison
with
that
simplicity
and
helplessness
which
this
girl
had
hitherto
displayed
it
argued
the
deepest
apprehensions
of
mistreatment
from
her
uncle
whether
his
conduct
had
justified
this
violent
antipathy
i
had
no
means
of
judging
mr
hadwin's
choice
of
him
as
his
executor
was
certainly
one
proof
of
his
integrity
my
abstraction
was
noticed
by
eliza
with
visible
anxiety
it
was
plain
that
she
dreaded
the
impression
which
this
act
of
seeming
temerity
had
made
upon
me
do
not
be
angry
with
me
said
she
perhaps
i
have
been
wrong
but
i
could
not
help
it
i
will
have
but
one
guardian
and
one
protector
the
deed
was
irrevocable
in
my
present
ignorance
of
the
domestic
history
of
the
hadwins
i
was
unqualified
to
judge
how
far
circumstances
might
extenuate
or
justify
the
act
on
both
accounts
therefore
it
was
improper
to
expatiate
upon
it
it
was
concluded
to
leave
the
care
of
the
house
to
honest
caleb
to
fasten
closets
and
drawers
and
carrying
away
the
money
which
was
found
in
one
of
them
and
which
amounted
to
no
inconsiderable
sum
to
repair
to
the
house
formerly
mentioned
the
air
was
cold
a
heavy
snow
began
to
fall
in
the
night
the
wind
blew
tempestuously
and
we
were
compelled
to
confront
it
in
leaving
her
dwelling
in
which
she
had
spent
her
whole
life
the
unhappy
girl
gave
way
afresh
to
her
sorrow
it
made
her
feeble
and
helpless
when
placed
upon
the
horse
she
was
scarcely
able
to
maintain
her
seat
already
chilled
by
the
cold
blinded
by
the
drifting
snow
and
cut
by
the
blast
all
my
remonstrances
were
needed
to
inspire
her
with
resolution
i
am
not
accustomed
to
regard
the
elements
or
suffer
them
to
retard
or
divert
me
from
any
design
that
i
have
formed
i
had
overlooked
the
weak
and
delicate
frame
of
my
companion
and
made
no
account
of
her
being
less
able
to
support
cold
and
fatigue
than
myself
it
was
not
till
we
had
made
some
progress
in
our
way
that
i
began
to
view
in
their
true
light
the
obstacles
that
were
to
be
encountered
i
conceived
it
however
too
late
to
retreat
and
endeavoured
to
push
on
with
speed
my
companion
was
a
skilful
rider
but
her
steed
was
refractory
and
unmanageable
she
was
able
however
to
curb
his
spirit
till
we
had
proceeded
ten
or
twelve
miles
from
malverton
the
wind
and
the
cold
became
too
violent
to
be
longer
endured
and
i
resolved
to
stop
at
the
first
house
which
should
present
itself
to
my
view
for
the
sake
of
refreshment
and
warmth
we
now
entered
a
wood
of
some
extent
at
the
termination
of
which
i
remembered
that
a
dwelling
stood
to
pass
this
wood
therefore
with
expedition
was
all
that
remained
before
we
could
reach
a
hospitable
asylum
i
endeavoured
to
sustain
by
this
information
the
sinking
spirits
of
my
companion
while
busy
in
conversing
with
her
a
blast
of
irresistible
force
twisted
off
the
highest
branch
of
a
tree
before
us
it
fell
in
the
midst
of
the
road
at
the
distance
of
a
few
feet
from
her
horse's
head
terrified
by
this
accident
the
horse
started
from
the
path
and
rushing
into
the
wood
in
a
moment
threw
himself
and
his
rider
on
the
ground
by
encountering
the
rugged
stock
of
an
oak
i
dismounted
and
flew
to
her
succour
the
snow
was
already
dyed
with
the
blood
which
flowed
from
some
wound
in
her
head
and
she
lay
without
sense
or
motion
my
terrors
did
not
hinder
me
from
anxiously
searching
for
the
hurt
which
was
received
and
ascertaining
the
extent
of
the
injury
her
forehead
was
considerably
bruised
but
to
my
unspeakable
joy
the
blood
flowed
from
the
nostrils
and
was
therefore
to
be
regarded
as
no
mortal
symptom
i
lifted
her
in
my
arms
and
looked
around
me
for
some
means
of
relief
the
house
at
which
i
proposed
to
stop
was
upwards
of
a
mile
distant
i
remembered
none
that
was
nearer
to
place
the
wounded
girl
on
my
own
horse
and
proceed
gently
to
the
house
in
question
was
the
sole
expedient
but
at
present
she
was
senseless
and
might
on
recovering
be
too
feeble
to
sustain
her
own
weight
to
recall
her
to
life
was
my
first
duty
but
i
was
powerless
or
unacquainted
with
the
means
i
gazed
upon
her
features
and
endeavoured
by
pressing
her
in
my
arms
to
inspire
her
with
some
warmth
i
looked
towards
the
road
and
listened
for
the
wished-for
sound
of
some
carriage
that
might
be
prevailed
on
to
stop
and
receive
her
nothing
was
more
improbable
than
that
either
pleasure
or
business
would
induce
men
to
encounter
so
chilling
and
vehement
a
blast
to
be
lighted
on
by
some
traveller
was
therefore
a
hopeless
event
meanwhile
eliza's
swoon
continued
and
my
alarm
increased
what
effect
her
half-frozen
blood
would
have
in
prolonging
this
condition
or
preventing
her
return
to
life
awakened
the
deepest
apprehensions
i
left
the
wood
still
bearing
her
in
my
arms
and
re-entered
the
road
from
the
desire
of
descrying
as
soon
as
possible
the
coming
passenger
i
looked
this
way
and
that
and
again
listened
nothing
but
the
sweeping
blast
rent
and
fallen
branches
and
snow
that
filled
and
obscured
the
air
were
perceivable
each
moment
retarded
the
course
of
my
own
blood
and
stiffened
my
sinews
and
made
the
state
of
my
companion
more
desperate
how
was
i
to
act
to
perish
myself
or
see
her
perish
was
an
ignoble
fate
courage
and
activity
were
still
able
to
avert
it
my
horse
stood
near
docile
and
obsequious
to
mount
him
and
to
proceed
on
my
way
holding
my
lifeless
burden
in
my
arms
was
all
that
remained
at
this
moment
my
attention
was
called
by
several
voices
issuing
from
the
wood
it
was
the
note
of
gayety
and
glee
presently
a
sleigh
with
several
persons
of
both
sexes
appeared
in
a
road
which
led
through
the
forest
into
that
in
which
i
stood
they
moved
at
a
quick
pace
but
their
voices
were
hushed
and
they
checked
the
speed
of
their
horses
on
discovering
us
no
occurrence
was
more
auspicious
than
this
for
i
relied
with
perfect
confidence
on
the
benevolence
of
these
persons
and
as
soon
as
they
came
near
claimed
their
assistance
my
story
was
listened
to
with
sympathy
and
one
of
the
young
men
leaping
from
the
sleigh
assisted
me
in
placing
eliza
in
the
place
which
he
had
left
a
female
of
sweet
aspect
and
engaging
manners
insisted
upon
turning
back
and
hastening
to
the
house
where
it
seems
her
father
resided
and
which
the
party
had
just
left
i
rode
after
the
sleigh
which
in
a
few
minutes
arrived
at
the
house
the
dwelling
was
spacious
and
neat
and
a
venerable
man
and
woman
alarmed
by
the
quick
return
of
the
young
people
came
forth
to
know
the
cause
they
received
their
guest
with
the
utmost
tenderness
and
provided
her
with
all
the
accommodations
which
her
condition
required
their
daughter
relinquished
the
scheme
of
pleasure
in
which
she
had
been
engaged
and
compelling
her
companions
to
depart
without
her
remained
to
nurse
and
console
the
sick
a
little
time
showed
that
no
lasting
injury
had
been
suffered
contusions
more
troublesome
than
dangerous
and
easily
curable
by
such
applications
as
rural
and
traditional
wisdom
has
discovered
were
the
only
consequences
of
the
fall
my
mind
being
relieved
from
apprehensions
on
this
score
had
leisure
to
reflect
upon
the
use
which
might
be
made
of
the
present
state
of
things
when
i
remarked
the
structure
of
this
house
and
the
features
and
deportment
of
its
inhabitants
methought
i
discerned
a
powerful
resemblance
between
this
family
and
hadwin's
it
seemed
as
if
some
benignant
power
had
led
us
hither
as
to
the
most
suitable
asylum
that
could
be
obtained
and
in
order
to
supply
to
the
forlorn
eliza
the
place
of
those
parents
and
that
sister
she
had
lost
i
conceived
that
if
their
concurrence
could
be
gained
no
abode
was
more
suitable
than
this
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
gaining
this
concurrence
the
curiosity
of
our
host
and
hostess
whose
name
was
curling
speedily
afforded
me
an
opportunity
to
disclose
the
history
and
real
situation
of
my
friend
there
were
no
motives
to
reserve
or
prevarication
there
was
nothing
which
i
did
not
faithfully
and
circumstantially
relate
i
concluded
with
stating
my
wishes
that
they
would
admit
my
friend
as
a
boarder
into
their
house
the
old
man
was
warm
in
his
concurrence
his
wife
betrayed
some
scruples
which
however
her
husband's
arguments
and
mine
removed
i
did
not
even
suppress
the
tenor
and
destruction
of
the
will
and
the
antipathy
which
eliza
had
conceived
for
her
uncle
and
which
i
declared
myself
unable
to
explain
it
presently
appeared
that
mr
curling
had
some
knowledge
of
philip
hadwin
and
that
the
latter
had
acquired
the
repute
of
being
obdurate
and
profligate
he
employed
all
means
to
accomplish
his
selfish
ends
and
would
probably
endeavour
to
usurp
the
property
which
his
brother
had
left
to
provide
against
his
power
and
his
malice
would
be
particularly
incumbent
on
us
and
my
new
friend
readily
promised
his
assistance
in
the
measures
which
we
should
take
to
that
end
the
state
of
my
feelings
may
be
easily
conceived
to
consist
of
mixed
but
on
the
whole
of
agreeable
sensations
the
death
of
hadwin
and
his
elder
daughter
could
not
be
thought
upon
without
keen
regrets
these
it
was
useless
to
indulge
and
were
outweighed
by
reflections
on
the
personal
security
in
which
the
survivor
was
now
placed
it
was
hurtful
to
expend
my
unprofitable
cares
upon
the
dead
while
there
existed
one
to
whom
they
could
be
of
essential
benefit
and
in
whose
happiness
they
would
find
an
ample
compensation
this
happiness
however
was
still
incomplete
it
was
still
exposed
to
hazard
and
much
remained
to
be
done
before
adequate
provision
was
made
against
the
worst
of
evils
poverty
i
now
found
that
eliza
being
only
fifteen
years
old
stood
in
need
of
a
guardian
and
that
the
forms
of
law
required
that
some
one
should
make
himself
her
father's
administrator
mr
curling
being
tolerably
conversant
with
these
subjects
pointed
out
the
mode
to
be
pursued
and
engaged
to
act
on
this
occasion
as
eliza's
friend
there
was
another
topic
on
which
my
happiness
as
well
as
that
of
my
friend
required
us
to
form
some
decision
i
formerly
mentioned
that
during
my
abode
at
malverton
i
had
not
been
insensible
to
the
attractions
of
this
girl
an
affection
had
stolen
upon
me
for
which
it
was
easily
discovered
that
i
should
not
have
been
denied
a
suitable
return
my
reasons
for
stifling
these
emotions
at
that
time
have
been
mentioned
it
may
now
be
asked
what
effect
subsequent
events
had
produced
on
my
feelings
and
how
far
partaking
and
relieving
her
distresses
had
revived
a
passion
which
may
readily
be
supposed
to
have
been
at
no
time
entirely
extinguished
the
impediments
which
then
existed
were
removed
our
union
would
no
longer
risk
the
resentment
or
sorrow
of
her
excellent
parent
she
had
no
longer
a
sister
to
divide
with
her
the
property
of
the
farm
and
make
what
was
sufficient
for
both
when
living
together
too
little
for
either
separately
her
youth
and
simplicity
required
beyond
most
others
a
legal
protector
and
her
happiness
was
involved
in
the
success
of
those
hopes
which
she
took
no
pains
to
conceal
as
to
me
it
seemed
at
first
view
as
if
every
incident
conspired
to
determine
my
choice
omitting
all
regard
to
the
happiness
of
others
my
own
interest
could
not
fail
to
recommend
a
scheme
by
which
the
precious
benefits
of
competence
and
independence
might
be
honestly
obtained
the
excursions
of
my
fancy
had
sometimes
carried
me
beyond
the
bounds
prescribed
by
my
situation
but
they
were
nevertheless
limited
to
that
field
to
which
i
had
once
some
prospect
of
acquiring
a
title
all
i
wanted
for
the
basis
of
my
gaudiest
and
most
dazzling
structures
was
a
hundred
acres
of
plough-land
and
meadow
here
my
spirit
of
improvement
my
zeal
to
invent
and
apply
new
maxims
of
household
luxury
and
convenience
new
modes
and
instruments
of
tillage
new
arts
connected
with
orchard
garden
and
cornfield
were
supplied
with
abundant
scope
though
the
want
of
these
would
not
benumb
my
activity
or
take
away
content
the
possession
would
confer
exquisite
and
permanent
enjoyments
my
thoughts
have
ever
hovered
over
the
images
of
wife
and
children
with
more
delight
than
over
any
other
images
my
fancy
was
always
active
on
this
theme
and
its
reveries
sufficiently
ecstatic
and
glowing
but
since
my
intercourse
with
this
girl
my
scattered
visions
were
collected
and
concentrated
i
had
now
a
form
and
features
before
me
a
sweet
and
melodious
voice
vibrated
in
my
ear
my
soul
was
filled
as
it
were
with
her
lineaments
and
gestures
actions
and
looks
all
ideas
possessing
any
relation
to
beauty
or
sex
appeared
to
assume
this
shape
they
kept
an
immovable
place
in
my
mind
they
diffused
around
them
an
ineffable
complacency
love
is
merely
of
value
as
a
prelude
to
a
more
tender
intimate
and
sacred
union
was
i
not
in
love
and
did
i
not
pant
after
the
irrevocable
bounds
the
boundless
privileges
of
wedlock
the
question
which
others
might
ask
i
have
asked
myself--was
i
not
in
love
i
am
really
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
there
seemed
to
be
irresistible
weight
in
the
reasons
why
i
should
refuse
to
marry
and
even
forbear
to
foster
love
in
my
friend
i
considered
my
youth
my
defective
education
and
my
limited
views
i
had
passed
from
my
cottage
into
the
world
i
had
acquired
even
in
my
transient
sojourn
among
the
busy
haunts
of
men
more
knowledge
than
the
lucubrations
and
employments
of
all
my
previous
years
had
conferred
hence
i
might
infer
the
childlike
immaturity
of
my
understanding
and
the
rapid
progress
i
was
still
capable
of
making
was
this
an
age
to
form
an
irrevocable
contract
to
choose
the
companion
of
my
future
life
the
associate
of
my
schemes
of
intellectual
and
benevolent
activity
i
had
reason
to
contemn
my
own
acquisitions
but
were
not
those
of
eliza
still
more
slender
could
i
rely
upon
the
permanence
of
her
equanimity
and
her
docility
to
my
instructions
what
qualities
might
not
time
unfold
and
how
little
was
i
qualified
to
estimate
the
character
of
one
whom
no
vicissitude
or
hardship
had
approached
before
the
death
of
her
father--whose
ignorance
was
indeed
great
when
it
could
justly
be
said
even
to
exceed
my
own
should
i
mix
with
the
world
enroll
myself
in
different
classes
of
society
be
a
witness
to
new
scenes
might
not
my
modes
of
judging
undergo
essential
variations
might
i
not
gain
the
knowledge
of
beings
whose
virtue
was
the
gift
of
experience
and
the
growth
of
knowledge
who
joined
to
the
modesty
and
charms
of
woman
the
benefits
of
education
the
maturity
and
steadfastness
of
age
and
with
whose
character
and
sentiments
my
own
would
be
much
more
congenial
than
they
could
possibly
be
with
the
extreme
youth
rustic
simplicity
and
mental
imperfections
of
eliza
hadwin
to
say
truth
i
was
now
conscious
of
a
revolution
in
my
mind
i
can
scarcely
assign
its
true
cause
no
tokens
of
it
appeared
during
my
late
retreat
to
malverton
subsequent
incidents
perhaps
joined
with
the
influence
of
meditation
had
generated
new
views
on
my
first
visit
to
the
city
i
had
met
with
nothing
but
scenes
of
folly
depravity
and
cunning
no
wonder
that
the
images
connected
with
the
city
were
disastrous
and
gloomy
but
my
second
visit
produced
somewhat
different
impressions
maravegli
estwick
medlicote
and
you
were
beings
who
inspired
veneration
and
love
your
residence
appeared
to
beautify
and
consecrate
this
spot
and
gave
birth
to
an
opinion
that
if
cities
are
the
chosen
seats
of
misery
and
vice
they
are
likewise
the
soil
of
all
the
laudable
and
strenuous
productions
of
mind
my
curiosity
and
thirst
of
knowledge
had
likewise
received
a
new
direction
books
and
inanimate
nature
were
cold
and
lifeless
instructors
men
and
the
works
of
men
were
the
objects
of
rational
study
and
our
own
eyes
only
could
communicate
just
conceptions
of
human
performances
the
influence
of
manners
professions
and
social
institutions
could
be
thoroughly
known
only
by
direct
inspection
competence
fixed
property
and
a
settled
abode
rural
occupations
and
conjugal
pleasures
were
justly
to
be
prized
but
their
value
could
be
known
and
their
benefits
fully
enjoyed
only
by
those
who
have
tried
all
scenes
who
have
mixed
with
all
classes
and
ranks
who
have
partaken
of
all
conditions
and
who
have
visited
different
hemispheres
and
climates
and
nations
the
next
five
or
eight
years
of
my
life
should
be
devoted
to
activity
and
change
it
should
be
a
period
of
hardship
danger
and
privation
it
should
be
my
apprenticeship
to
fortitude
and
wisdom
and
be
employed
to
fit
me
for
the
tranquil
pleasures
and
steadfast
exertions
of
the
remainder
of
my
life
in
consequence
of
these
reflections
i
determined
to
suppress
that
tenderness
which
the
company
of
miss
hadwin
produced
to
remove
any
mistakes
into
which
she
had
fallen
and
to
put
it
out
of
my
power
to
claim
for
her
more
than
the
dues
of
friendship
all
ambiguities
in
a
case
like
this
and
all
delays
were
hurtful
she
was
not
exempt
from
passion
but
this
passion
i
thought
was
young
and
easily
extinguished
in
a
short
time
her
health
was
restored
and
her
grief
melted
down
into
a
tender
melancholy
i
chose
a
suitable
moment
when
not
embarrassed
by
the
presence
of
others
to
reveal
my
thoughts
my
disclosure
was
ingenuous
and
perfect
i
laid
before
her
the
whole
train
of
my
thoughts
nearly
in
the
order
though
in
different
and
more
copious
terms
than
those
in
which
i
have
just
explained
them
to
you
i
concealed
nothing
the
impression
which
her
artless
loveliness
had
made
upon
me
at
malverton
my
motives
for
estranging
myself
from
her
society
the
nature
of
my
present
feelings
with
regard
to
her
and
my
belief
of
the
state
of
her
heart
the
reasonings
into
which
i
had
entered
the
advantages
of
wedlock
and
its
inconveniences
and
finally
the
resolution
i
had
formed
of
seeking
the
city
and
perhaps
of
crossing
the
ocean
were
minutely
detailed
she
interrupted
me
not
but
changing
looks
blushes
flutterings
and
sighs
showed
her
to
be
deeply
and
variously
affected
by
my
discourse
i
paused
for
some
observation
or
comment
she
seemed
conscious
of
my
expectation
but
had
no
power
to
speak
overpowered
at
length
by
her
emotions
she
burst
into
tears
i
was
at
a
loss
in
what
manner
to
construe
these
symptoms
i
waited
till
her
vehemence
was
somewhat
subsided
and
then
said
what
think
you
of
my
schemes
your
approbation
is
of
some
moment
do
you
approve
of
them
or
not
this
question
excited
some
little
resentment
and
she
answered
you
have
left
me
nothing
to
say
go
and
be
happy
no
matter
what
becomes
of
me
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
take
care
of
myself
the
tone
in
which
this
was
said
had
something
in
it
of
upbraiding
your
happiness
said
i
is
too
dear
to
me
to
leave
it
in
danger
in
this
house
you
will
not
need
my
protection
but
i
shall
never
be
so
far
from
you
as
to
be
disabled
from
hearing
how
you
fare
by
letter
and
of
being
active
for
your
good
you
have
some
money
which
you
must
husband
well
any
rent
from
your
farm
cannot
be
soon
expected
but
what
you
have
got
if
you
remain
with
mr
curling
will
pay
your
board
and
all
other
expenses
for
two
years
but
you
must
be
a
good
economist
i
shall
expect
continued
i
with
a
serious
smile
a
punctual
account
of
all
your
sayings
and
doings
i
must
know
how
every
minute
is
employed
and
every
penny
is
expended
and
if
i
find
you
erring
i
must
tell
you
so
in
good
round
terms
these
words
did
not
dissipate
the
sullenness
which
her
looks
had
betrayed
she
still
forbore
to
look
at
me
and
said
i
do
not
know
how
i
should
tell
you
every
thing
you
care
so
little
about
me
that--i
should
only
be
troublesome
i
am
old
enough
to
think
and
act
for
myself
and
shall
advise
with
nobody
but
myself
that
is
true
said
i
i
shall
rejoice
to
see
you
independent
and
free
consult
your
own
understanding
and
act
according
to
its
dictates
nothing
more
is
wanting
to
make
you
useful
and
happy
i
am
anxious
to
return
to
the
city
but
if
you
will
allow
me
will
go
first
to
malverton
see
that
things
are
in
due
order
and
that
old
caleb
is
well
from
thence
if
you
please
i
will
call
at
your
uncle's
and
tell
him
what
has
happened
he
may
otherwise
entertain
pretensions
and
form
views
erroneous
in
themselves
and
injurious
to
you
he
may
think
himself
entitled
to
manage
your
estate
he
may
either
suppose
a
will
to
have
been
made
or
may
actually
have
heard
from
your
father
or
from
others
of
that
which
you
burnt
and
in
which
he
was
named
executor
his
boisterous
and
sordid
temper
may
prompt
him
to
seize
your
house
and
goods
unless
seasonably
apprized
of
the
truth
and
when
he
knows
the
truth
he
may
start
into
rage
which
i
shall
be
more
fitted
to
encounter
than
you
i
am
told
that
anger
transforms
him
into
a
ferocious
madman
shall
i
call
upon
him
she
shuddered
at
the
picture
which
i
had
drawn
of
her
uncle's
character
but
this
emotion
quickly
gave
place
to
self-upbraiding
for
the
manner
in
which
she
had
repelled
my
proffers
of
service
she
melted
once
more
into
tears
and
exclaimed--
i
am
not
worthy
of
the
pains
you
take
for
me
i
am
unfeeling
and
ungrateful
why
should
i
think
ill
of
you
for
despising
me
when
i
despise
myself
you
do
yourself
injustice
my
friend
i
think
i
see
your
most
secret
thoughts
and
these
instead
of
exciting
anger
or
contempt
only
awaken
compassion
and
tenderness
you
love
and
must
therefore
conceive
my
conduct
to
be
perverse
and
cruel
i
counted
on
your
harbouring
such
thoughts
time
only
and
reflection
will
enable
you
to
see
my
motives
in
their
true
light
hereafter
you
will
recollect
my
words
and
find
them
sufficient
to
justify
my
conduct
you
will
acknowledge
the
propriety
of
my
engaging
in
the
cares
of
the
world
before
i
sit
down
in
retirement
and
ease
ah
how
much
you
mistake
me
i
admire
and
approve
of
your
schemes
what
angers
and
distresses
me
is
that
you
think
me
unworthy
to
partake
of
your
cares
and
labours
that
you
regard
my
company
as
an
obstacle
and
encumbrance
that
assistance
and
counsel
must
all
proceed
from
you
and
that
no
scene
is
fit
for
me
but
what
you
regard
as
slothful
and
inglorious
have
i
not
the
same
claims
to
be
wise
and
active
and
courageous
as
you
if
i
am
ignorant
and
weak
do
i
not
owe
it
to
the
same
cause
that
has
made
you
so
and
will
not
the
same
means
which
promote
your
improvement
be
likewise
useful
to
me
you
desire
to
obtain
knowledge
by
travelling
and
conversing
with
many
persons
and
studying
many
sciences
but
you
desire
it
for
yourself
alone
me
you
think
poor
weak
and
contemptible
fit
for
nothing
but
to
spin
and
churn
provided
i
exist
am
screened
from
the
weather
have
enough
to
eat
and
drink
you
are
satisfied
as
to
strengthening
my
mind
and
enlarging
my
knowledge
these
things
are
valuable
to
you
but
on
me
they
are
thrown
away
i
deserve
not
the
gift
this
strain
simple
and
just
as
it
was
was
wholly
unexpected
i
was
surprised
and
disconcerted
in
my
previous
reasonings
i
had
certainly
considered
her
sex
as
utterly
unfitting
her
for
those
scenes
and
pursuits
to
which
i
had
destined
myself
not
a
doubt
of
the
validity
of
my
conclusion
had
insinuated
itself
but
now
my
belief
was
shaken
though
it
was
not
subverted
i
could
not
deny
that
human
ignorance
was
curable
by
the
same
means
in
one
sex
as
in
the
other
that
fortitude
and
skill
were
of
no
less
value
to
one
than
to
the
other
questionless
my
friend
was
rendered
by
her
age
and
inexperience
if
not
by
sex
more
helpless
and
dependent
than
i
but
had
i
not
been
prone
to
overrate
the
difficulties
which
i
should
encounter
had
i
not
deemed
unjustly
of
her
constancy
and
force
of
mind
marriage
would
render
her
property
joint
and
would
not
compel
me
to
take
up
my
abode
in
the
woods
to
abide
forever
in
one
spot
to
shackle
my
curiosity
or
limit
my
excursions
but
marriage
was
a
contract
awful
and
irrevocable
was
this
the
woman
with
whom
my
reason
enjoined
me
to
blend
my
fate
without
the
power
of
dissolution
would
not
time
unfold
qualities
in
her
which
i
did
not
at
present
suspect
and
which
would
evince
an
incurable
difference
in
our
minds
would
not
time
lead
me
to
the
feet
of
one
who
more
nearly
approached
that
standard
of
ideal
excellence
which
poets
and
romancers
had
exhibited
to
my
view
these
considerations
were
powerful
and
delicate
i
knew
not
in
what
terms
to
state
them
to
my
companion
so
as
to
preclude
the
imputation
of
arrogance
or
indecorum
it
became
me
however
to
be
explicit
and
to
excite
her
resentment
rather
than
mislead
her
judgment
she
collected
my
meaning
from
a
few
words
and
interrupting
me
said--
how
very
low
is
the
poor
eliza
in
your
opinion
we
are
indeed
both
too
young
to
be
married
may
i
not
see
you
and
talk
with
you
without
being
your
wife
may
i
not
share
your
knowledge
relieve
your
cares
and
enjoy
your
confidence
as
a
sister
might
do
may
i
not
accompany
you
in
your
journeys
and
studies
as
one
friend
accompanies
another
my
property
may
be
yours
you
may
employ
it
for
your
benefit
and
mine
not
because
you
are
my
husband
but
my
friend
you
are
going
to
the
city
let
me
go
along
with
you
let
me
live
where
you
live
the
house
that
is
large
enough
to
hold
you
will
hold
me
the
fare
that
is
good
enough
for
you
will
be
luxury
to
me
oh
let
it
be
so
will
you
you
cannot
think
how
studious
how
thoughtful
how
inquisitive
i
will
be
how
tenderly
i
will
nurse
you
when
sick
it
is
possible
you
may
be
sick
you
know
and
no
one
in
the
world
will
be
half
so
watchful
and
affectionate
as
i
shall
be
will
you
let
me
in
saying
this
her
earnestness
gave
new
pathos
to
her
voice
insensibly
she
put
her
face
close
to
mine
and
transported
beyond
the
usual
bounds
of
reserve
by
the
charms
of
that
picture
which
her
fancy
contemplated
she
put
her
lips
to
my
cheek
and
repeated
in
a
melting
accent
will
you
let
me
you
my
friends
who
have
not
seen
eliza
hadwin
cannot
conceive
what
effect
this
entreaty
was
adapted
to
produce
in
me
she
has
surely
the
sweetest
voice
the
most
speaking
features
and
most
delicate
symmetry
that
ever
woman
possessed
her
guileless
simplicity
and
tenderness
made
her
more
enchanting
to
be
the
object
of
devotion
to
a
heart
so
fervent
and
pure
was
surely
no
common
privilege
thus
did
she
tender
me
herself
and
was
not
the
gift
to
be
received
with
eagerness
and
gratitude
no
i
was
not
so
much
a
stranger
to
mankind
as
to
acquiesce
in
this
scheme
as
my
sister
or
my
wife
the
world
would
suffer
us
to
reside
under
the
same
roof
to
apply
to
common
use
the
same
property
and
daily
to
enjoy
the
company
of
each
other
but
she
was
not
my
sister
and
marriage
would
be
an
act
of
the
grossest
indiscretion
i
explained
to
her
in
few
words
the
objections
to
which
her
project
was
liable
well
then
said
she
let
me
live
in
the
next
house
in
the
neighbourhood
or
at
least
in
the
same
city
let
me
be
where
i
may
see
you
once
a
day
or
once
a
week
or
once
a
month
shut
me
not
wholly
from
your
society
and
the
means
of
becoming
in
time
less
ignorant
and
foolish
than
i
now
am
after
a
pause
i
replied
i
love
you
too
well
not
to
comply
with
this
request
perhaps
the
city
will
be
as
suitable
a
residence
as
any
other
for
you
as
it
will
for
some
time
be
most
convenient
to
me
i
shall
be
better
able
to
watch
over
your
welfare
and
supply
you
with
the
means
of
improvement
when
you
are
within
a
small
distance
at
present
you
must
consent
to
remain
here
while
i
visit
your
uncle
and
afterwards
go
to
the
city
i
shall
look
out
for
you
a
suitable
lodging
and
inform
you
when
it
is
found
if
you
then
continue
in
the
same
mind
i
will
come
and
having
gained
the
approbation
of
mr
curling
will
conduct
you
to
town
here
ended
our
dialogue
though
i
had
consented
to
this
scheme
i
was
conscious
that
some
hazards
attended
it
i
was
afraid
of
calumny
which
might
trouble
the
peace
or
destroy
the
reputation
of
my
friend
i
was
afraid
of
my
own
weakness
which
might
be
seduced
into
an
indiscreet
marriage
by
the
charms
or
sufferings
of
this
bewitching
creature
i
felt
that
there
was
no
price
too
dear
to
save
her
from
slander
a
fair
fame
is
of
the
highest
importance
to
a
young
female
and
the
loss
of
it
but
poorly
supplied
by
the
testimony
of
her
own
conscience
i
had
reason
for
tenfold
solicitude
on
this
account
since
i
was
her
only
protector
and
friend
hence
i
cherished
some
hopes
that
time
might
change
her
views
and
suggest
less
dangerous
schemes
meanwhile
i
was
to
lose
no
time
in
visiting
malverton
and
philip
hadwin
about
ten
days
had
elapsed
since
we
had
deserted
malverton
these
were
days
of
successive
storms
and
travelling
had
been
rendered
inconvenient
the
weather
was
now
calm
and
clear
and
early
in
the
morning
that
ensued
the
dialogue
which
i
have
just
related
i
set
out
on
horseback
honest
caleb
was
found
eating
his
breakfast
nearly
in
the
spot
where
he
had
been
first
discovered
he
answered
my
inquiries
by
saying
that
two
days
after
our
departure
several
men
had
come
to
the
house
one
of
whom
was
philip
hadwin
they
had
interrogated
him
as
to
the
condition
of
the
farm
and
the
purpose
of
his
remaining
on
it
william
hadwin
they
knew
to
have
been
some
time
dead
but
where
were
the
girls
his
daughters
caleb
answered
that
susy
the
eldest
was
likewise
dead
these
tidings
excited
astonishment
when
died
she
and
how
and
where
was
she
buried
it
happened
two
days
before
and
she
was
buried
he
believed
but
could
not
tell
where
not
tell
where
by
whom
then
was
she
buried
really
he
could
not
tell
some
strange
man
came
there
just
as
she
was
dying
he
went
to
the
room
and
when
she
was
dead
took
her
away
but
what
he
did
with
the
body
was
more
than
he
could
say
but
he
had
a
notion
that
he
buried
it
the
man
stayed
till
the
morning
and
then
went
off
with
lizzy
leaving
him
to
keep
house
by
himself
he
had
not
seen
either
of
them
nor
indeed
a
single
soul
since
this
was
all
the
information
that
caleb
could
afford
the
visitants
it
was
so
lame
and
incredible
that
they
began
to
charge
the
man
with
falsehood
and
to
threaten
him
with
legal
animadversion
just
then
mr
ellis
entered
the
house
and
being
made
acquainted
with
the
subject
of
discourse
told
all
that
he
himself
knew
he
related
the
midnight
visit
which
i
had
paid
him
explained
my
former
situation
in
the
family
and
my
disappearance
in
september
he
stated
the
advice
he
had
given
me
to
carry
eliza
to
her
uncle's
and
my
promise
to
comply
with
his
counsel
the
uncle
declared
he
had
seen
nothing
of
his
niece
and
caleb
added
that
when
she
set
out
she
took
the
road
that
led
to
town
these
hints
afforded
grounds
for
much
conjecture
and
suspicion
ellis
now
mentioned
some
intelligence
that
he
had
gathered
respecting
me
in
a
late
journey
to
----
it
seems
i
was
the
son
of
an
honest
farmer
in
that
quarter
who
married
a
tidy
girl
of
a
milkmaid
that
lived
with
him
my
father
had
detected
me
in
making
some
atrocious
advances
to
my
mother-in-law
and
had
turned
me
out
of
doors
i
did
not
go
off
however
without
rifling
his
drawer
of
some
hundreds
of
dollars
which
he
had
laid
up
against
a
rainy
day
i
was
noted
for
such
pranks
and
was
hated
by
all
the
neighbours
for
my
pride
and
laziness
it
was
easy
by
comparison
of
circumstances
for
ellis
to
ascertain
that
hadwin's
servant
mervyn
was
the
same
against
whom
such
heavy
charges
were
laid
previously
to
this
journey
he
had
heard
of
me
from
hadwin
who
was
loud
in
praise
of
my
diligence
sobriety
and
modesty
for
his
part
he
had
always
been
cautious
of
giving
countenance
to
vagrants
that
came
from
nobody
knew
where
and
worked
their
way
with
a
plausible
tongue
he
was
not
surprised
to
hear
it
whispered
that
betsy
hadwin
had
fallen
in
love
with
the
youth
and
now
no
doubt
he
had
persuaded
her
to
run
away
with
him
the
heiress
of
a
fine
farm
was
a
prize
not
to
be
met
with
every
day
philip
broke
into
rage
at
this
news
swore
that
if
it
turned
out
so
his
niece
should
starve
upon
the
town
and
that
he
would
take
good
care
to
balk
the
lad
his
brother
he
well
knew
had
left
a
will
to
which
he
was
executor
and
that
this
will
would
in
good
time
be
forthcoming
after
much
talk
and
ransacking
the
house
and
swearing
at
his
truant
niece
he
and
his
company
departed
charging
caleb
to
keep
the
house
and
its
contents
for
his
use
this
was
all
that
caleb's
memory
had
retained
of
that
day's
proceedings
curling
had
lately
commented
on
the
character
of
philip
hadwin
this
man
was
totally
unlike
his
brother
was
a
noted
brawler
and
bully
a
tyrant
to
his
children
a
plague
to
his
neighbours
and
kept
a
rendezvous
for
drunkards
and
idlers
at
the
sign
of
the
bull's
head
at
----
he
was
not
destitute
of
parts
and
was
no
less
dreaded
for
cunning
than
malignity
he
was
covetous
and
never
missed
an
opportunity
of
overreaching
his
neighbour
there
was
no
doubt
that
his
niece's
property
would
be
embezzled
should
it
ever
come
into
his
hands
and
any
power
which
he
might
obtain
over
her
person
would
be
exercised
to
her
destruction
his
children
were
tainted
with
the
dissoluteness
of
their
father
and
marriage
had
not
repaired
the
reputation
of
his
daughters
or
cured
them
of
depravity
this
was
the
man
whom
i
now
proposed
to
visit
i
scarcely
need
to
say
that
the
calumny
of
betty
lawrence
gave
me
no
uneasiness
my
father
had
no
doubt
been
deceived
as
well
as
my
father's
neighbours
by
the
artifices
of
this
woman
i
passed
among
them
for
a
thief
and
a
profligate
but
their
error
had
hitherto
been
harmless
to
me
the
time
might
come
which
should
confute
the
tale
without
my
efforts
betty
sooner
or
later
would
drop
her
mask
and
afford
the
antidote
to
her
own
poisons
unless
some
new
incident
should
occur
to
make
me
hasten
the
catastrophe
i
arrived
at
hadwin's
house
i
was
received
with
some
attention
as
a
guest
i
looked
among
the
pimpled
visages
that
filled
the
piazza
for
that
of
the
landlord
but
found
him
in
an
inner
apartment
with
two
or
three
more
seated
round
a
table
on
intimating
my
wish
to
speak
with
him
alone
the
others
withdrew
hadwin's
visage
had
some
traces
of
resemblance
to
his
brother
but
the
meek
placid
air
pale
cheeks
and
slender
form
of
the
latter
were
powerfully
contrasted
with
the
bloated
arrogance
imperious
brow
and
robust
limbs
of
the
former
this
man's
rage
was
awakened
by
a
straw
it
impelled
him
in
an
instant
to
oaths
and
buffetings
and
made
his
life
an
eternal
brawl
the
sooner
my
interview
with
such
a
personage
should
be
at
an
end
the
better
i
therefore
explained
the
purpose
of
my
coming
as
fully
and
in
as
few
words
as
possible
your
name
sir
is
philip
hadwin
your
brother
william
of
malverton
died
lately
and
left
two
daughters
the
youngest
only
is
now
alive
and
i
come
commissioned
from
her
to
inform
you
that
as
no
will
of
her
father's
is
extant
she
is
preparing
to
administer
to
his
estate
as
her
father's
brother
she
thought
you
entitled
to
this
information
the
change
which
took
place
in
the
countenance
of
this
man
during
this
address
was
remarkable
but
not
easily
described
his
cheeks
contracted
a
deeper
crimson
his
eyes
sparkled
and
his
face
assumed
an
expression
in
which
curiosity
was
mingled
with
rage
he
bent
forward
and
said
in
a
hoarse
and
contemptuous
tone
pray
is
your
name
mervyn
i
answered
without
hesitation
and
as
if
the
question
were
wholly
unimportant
yes
my
name
is
mervyn
god
damn
it
you
then
are
the
damned
rascal--but
permit
me
to
repeat
his
speech
without
the
oaths
with
which
it
was
plentifully
interlarded
not
three
words
were
uttered
without
being
garnished
with
a--god
damn
it
damnation
i'll
be
damned
to
hell
if--and
the
like
energetic
expletives
you
then
are
the
rascal
that
robbed
billy's
house
that
ran
away
with
the
fool
his
daughter
persuaded
her
to
burn
her
father's
will
and
have
the
hellish
impudence
to
come
into
this
house
but
i
thank
you
for
it
i
was
going
to
look
for
you
you've
saved
me
trouble
i'll
settle
all
accounts
with
you
here
fair
and
softly
my
good
lad
if
i
don't
bring
you
to
the
gallows--if
i
let
you
escape
without
such
a
dressing
damned
impudence
fellow
i've
been
at
malverton
i've
heard
of
your
tricks
so
finding
the
will
not
quite
to
your
mind
knowing
that
the
executor
would
balk
your
schemes
you
threw
the
will
into
the
fire
you
robbed
the
house
of
all
the
cash
and
made
off
with
the
girl--the
old
fellow
saw
it
all
and
will
swear
to
the
truth
these
words
created
some
surprise
i
meant
not
to
conceal
from
this
man
the
tenor
and
destruction
of
the
will
nor
even
the
measures
which
his
niece
had
taken
or
intended
to
take
what
i
supposed
to
be
unknown
to
him
appeared
to
have
been
communicated
by
the
talkative
caleb
whose
mind
was
more
inquisitive
and
less
sluggish
than
first
appearances
had
led
me
to
imagine
instead
of
moping
by
the
kitchen-fire
when
eliza
and
i
were
conversing
in
an
upper
room
it
now
appeared
that
he
had
reconnoitred
our
proceedings
through
some
keyhole
or
crevice
and
had
related
what
he
had
seen
to
hadwin
hadwin
proceeded
to
exhaust
his
rage
in
oaths
and
menaces
he
frequently
clenched
his
fist
and
thrust
it
in
my
face
drew
it
back
as
if
to
render
his
blow
more
deadly
ran
over
the
same
series
of
exclamations
on
my
impudence
and
villany
and
talked
of
the
gallows
and
the
whipping-post
enforced
each
word
by
the
epithets
damnable
and
hellish
closed
each
sentence
with--and
be
curst
to
you
there
was
but
one
mode
for
me
to
pursue
all
forcible
opposition
to
a
man
of
his
strength
was
absurd
it
was
my
province
to
make
his
anger
confine
itself
to
words
and
patiently
to
wait
till
the
paroxysm
should
end
or
subside
of
itself
to
effect
this
purpose
i
kept
my
seat
and
carefully
excluded
from
my
countenance
every
indication
of
timidity
and
panic
on
the
one
hand
and
of
scorn
and
defiance
on
the
other
my
look
and
attitude
were
those
of
a
man
who
expected
harsh
words
but
who
entertained
no
suspicion
that
blows
would
be
inflicted
i
was
indebted
for
my
safety
to
an
inflexible
adherence
to
this
medium
to
have
strayed
for
a
moment
to
either
side
would
have
brought
upon
me
his
blows
that
he
did
not
instantly
resort
to
violence
inspired
me
with
courage
since
it
depended
on
myself
whether
food
should
be
supplied
to
his
passion
rage
must
either
progress
or
decline
and
since
it
was
in
total
want
of
provocation
it
could
not
fail
of
gradually
subsiding
my
demeanour
was
calculated
to
damp
the
flame
not
only
by
its
direct
influence
but
by
diverting
his
attention
from
the
wrongs
which
he
had
received
to
the
novelty
of
my
behaviour
the
disparity
in
size
and
strength
between
us
was
too
evident
to
make
him
believe
that
i
confided
in
my
sinews
for
my
defence
and
since
i
betrayed
neither
contempt
nor
fear
he
could
not
but
conclude
that
i
trusted
to
my
own
integrity
or
to
his
moderation
i
seized
the
first
pause
in
his
rhetoric
to
enforce
this
sentiment
you
are
angry
mr
hadwin
and
are
loud
in
your
threats
but
they
do
not
frighten
me
they
excite
no
apprehension
or
alarm
because
i
know
myself
able
to
convince
you
that
i
have
not
injured
you
this
is
an
inn
and
i
am
your
guest
i
am
sure
i
shall
find
better
entertainment
than
blows
come
continued
i
smiling
it
is
possible
that
i
am
not
so
mischievous
a
wretch
as
your
fancy
paints
me
i
have
no
claims
upon
your
niece
but
that
of
friendship
and
she
is
now
in
the
house
of
an
honest
man
mr
curling
where
she
proposes
to
continue
as
long
as
is
convenient
it
is
true
that
your
brother
left
a
will
which
his
daughter
burnt
in
my
presence
because
she
dreaded
the
authority
which
that
will
gave
you
not
only
over
her
property
but
person
it
is
true
that
on
leaving
the
house
she
took
away
the
money
which
was
now
her
own
and
which
was
necessary
to
subsistence
it
is
true
that
i
bore
her
company
and
have
left
her
in
an
honest
man's
keeping
i
am
answerable
for
nothing
more
as
to
you
i
meant
not
to
injure
you
i
advised
not
the
burning
of
the
will
i
was
a
stranger
till
after
that
event
to
your
character
i
knew
neither
good
nor
ill
of
you
i
came
to
tell
you
all
this
because
as
eliza's
uncle
you
had
a
right
to
the
information
so
you
come
to
tell
me
that
she
burnt
the
will
and
is
going
to
administer--to
what
i
beseech
you
to
her
father's
property
ay
i
warrant
you
but
take
this
along
with
you--that
property
is
mine
land
house
stock
every
thing
all
is
safe
and
snug
under
cover
of
a
mortgage
to
which
billy
was
kind
enough
to
add
a
bond
one
was
sued
and
the
other
entered
up
a
week
ago
so
that
all
is
safe
under
my
thumb
and
the
girl
may
whistle
or
starve
for
me
i
shall
give
myself
no
concern
about
the
strumpet
you
thought
to
get
a
prize
but
damn
me
you've
met
with
your
match
in
me
phil
haddin's
not
so
easily
choused
i
promise
you
i
intended
to
give
you
this
news
and
a
drubbing
into
the
bargain
but
you
may
go
and
make
haste
she
burnt
the
will
did
she
because
i
was
named
in
it--and
sent
you
to
tell
me
so
good
souls
it
was
kind
of
you
and
i
am
bound
to
be
thankful
take
her
back
news
of
the
mortgage
and
as
for
you
leave
my
house
you
may
go
scot-free
this
time
but
i
pledge
my
word
for
a
sound
beating
when
you
next
enter
these
doors
i'll
pay
it
to
you
with
interest
leave
my
house
i
say
a
mortgage
said
i
in
a
low
voice
and
affecting
not
to
hear
his
commands
that
will
be
sad
news
for
my
friend
why
sir
you
are
a
fortunate
man
malverton
is
an
excellent
spot
well
watered
and
manured
newly
and
completely
fenced
not
a
larger
barn
in
the
county
oxen
and
horses
and
cows
in
the
best
order
i
never
set
eyes
on
a
finer
orchard
by
my
faith
sir
you
are
a
fortunate
man
but
pray
what
have
you
for
dinner
i
am
hungry
as
a
wolf
order
me
a
beef-steak
and
some
potation
or
other
the
bottle
there--it
is
cider
i
take
it
pray
push
it
to
this
side
saying
this
i
stretched
out
my
hand
towards
the
bottle
which
stood
before
him
i
confided
in
the
power
of
a
fearless
and
sedate
manner
methought
that
as
anger
was
the
food
of
anger
it
must
unavoidably
subside
in
a
contest
with
equability
this
opinion
was
intuitive
rather
than
the
product
of
experience
and
perhaps
i
gave
no
proof
of
my
sagacity
in
hazarding
my
safety
on
its
truth
hadwin's
character
made
him
dreaded
and
obeyed
by
all
he
had
been
accustomed
to
ready
and
tremulous
submission
from
men
far
more
brawny
and
robust
than
i
was
and
to
find
his
most
vehement
menaces
and
gestures
totally
ineffectual
on
a
being
so
slender
and
diminutive
at
once
wound
up
his
rage
and
excited
his
astonishment
one
motion
counteracted
and
suspended
the
other
he
lifted
his
hand
but
delayed
to
strike
one
blow
applied
with
his
usual
dexterity
was
sufficient
to
destroy
me
though
seemingly
careless
i
was
watchful
of
his
motions
and
prepared
to
elude
the
stroke
by
shrinking
or
stooping
meanwhile
i
stretched
my
hand
far
enough
to
seize
the
bottle
and
pouring
its
contents
into
a
tumbler
put
it
to
my
lips--
come
sir
i
drink
your
health
and
wish
you
speedy
possession
of
malverton
i
have
some
interest
with
eliza
and
will
prevail
on
her
to
forbear
all
opposition
and
complaint
why
should
she
complain
while
i
live
she
shall
not
be
a
beggar
no
doubt
your
claim
is
legal
and
therefore
ought
to
be
admitted
what
the
law
gave
the
law
has
taken
away
blessed
be
the
dispensers
of
law
excellent
cider
open
another
bottle
will
you
and
i
beseech
hasten
dinner
if
you
would
not
see
me
devour
the
table
it
was
just
perhaps
to
conjure
up
the
demon
avarice
to
fight
with
the
demon
anger
reason
alone
would
in
such
a
contest
be
powerless
but
in
truth
i
spoke
without
artifice
or
disguise
if
his
claim
were
legal
opposition
would
be
absurd
and
pernicious
i
meant
not
to
rely
upon
his
own
assertions
and
would
not
acknowledge
the
validity
of
his
claim
till
i
had
inspected
the
deed
having
instituted
suits
this
was
now
in
a
public
office
and
there
the
inspection
should
be
made
meanwhile
no
reason
could
be
urged
why
i
should
part
from
him
in
anger
while
his
kindred
to
eliza
and
his
title
to
her
property
made
it
useful
to
secure
his
favour
it
was
possible
to
obtain
a
remission
of
his
claims
even
when
the
law
enforced
them
it
would
be
imprudent
at
least
to
diminish
the
chances
of
remission
by
fostering
his
wrath
and
provoking
his
enmity
what
he
exclaimed
in
a
transport
of
fury
a'n't
i
master
of
my
own
house
out
i
say
these
were
harsh
terms
but
they
were
not
accompanied
by
gestures
and
tones
so
menacing
as
those
which
had
before
been
used
it
was
plain
that
the
tide
which
so
lately
threatened
my
destruction
had
begun
to
recede
this
encouraged
me
to
persist
be
not
alarmed
my
good
friend
said
i
placidly
and
smiling
a
man
of
your
bone
need
not
fear
a
pigmy
like
me
i
shall
scarcely
be
able
to
dethrone
you
in
your
own
castle
with
an
army
of
hostlers
tapsters
and
cooks
at
your
beck
you
shall
still
be
master
here
provided
you
use
your
influence
to
procure
me
a
dinner
his
acquiescence
in
a
pacific
system
was
extremely
reluctant
and
gradual
he
laid
aside
one
sullen
tone
and
wrathful
look
after
the
other
and
at
length
consented
not
only
to
supply
me
with
a
dinner
but
to
partake
of
it
with
me
nothing
was
more
a
topic
of
surprise
to
himself
than
his
forbearance
he
knew
not
how
it
was
he
had
never
been
treated
so
before
he
was
not
proof
against
entreaty
and
submission
but
i
had
neither
supplicated
nor
submitted
the
stuff
that
i
was
made
of
was
at
once
damnably
tough
and
devilishly
pliant
when
he
thought
of
my
impudence
in
staying
in
his
house
after
he
had
bade
me
leave
it
he
was
tempted
to
resume
his
passion
when
he
reflected
on
my
courage
in
making
light
of
his
anger
notwithstanding
his
known
impetuosity
and
my
personal
inferiority
he
could
not
withhold
his
esteem
but
my
patience
under
his
rebukes
my
unalterable
equanimity
and
my
ready
consent
to
the
validity
of
his
claims
soothed
and
propitiated
him
an
exemption
from
blows
and
abuse
was
all
that
i
could
gain
from
this
man
i
told
him
the
truth
with
regard
to
my
own
history
so
far
as
it
was
connected
with
the
hadwins
i
exhibited
in
affecting
colours
the
helpless
condition
of
eliza
but
could
extort
from
him
nothing
but
his
consent
that
if
she
chose
she
might
come
and
live
with
him
he
would
give
her
victuals
and
clothes
for
so
much
house-work
as
she
was
able
to
do
if
she
chose
to
live
elsewhere
he
promised
not
to
molest
her
or
intermeddle
in
her
concerns
the
house
and
land
were
his
by
law
and
he
would
have
them
it
was
not
my
province
to
revile
or
expostulate
with
him
i
stated
what
measures
would
be
adopted
by
a
man
who
regarded
the
interest
of
others
more
than
his
own
who
was
anxious
for
the
welfare
of
an
innocent
girl
connected
with
him
so
closely
by
the
ties
of
kindred
and
who
was
destitute
of
what
is
called
natural
friends
if
he
did
not
cancel
for
her
sake
his
bond
and
mortgage
he
would
at
least
afford
her
a
frugal
maintenance
he
would
extend
to
her
in
all
emergencies
his
counsel
and
protection
all
that
he
said
was
sheer
nonsense
he
could
not
sufficiently
wonder
at
my
folly
in
proposing
to
him
to
make
a
free
gift
of
a
hundred
rich
acres
to
a
girl
too
who
scarcely
knew
her
right
hand
from
her
left
whom
the
first
cunning
young
rogue
like
myself
would
chouse
out
of
the
whole
and
take
herself
into
the
bargain
but
my
folly
was
even
surpassed
by
my
impudence
since
as
the
friend
of
this
girl
i
was
merely
petitioning
on
my
own
account
i
had
come
to
him
whom
i
never
saw
before
on
whom
i
had
no
claim
and
who
as
i
well
knew
had
reason
to
think
me
a
sharper
and
modestly
said
here's
a
girl
who
has
no
fortune
i
am
greatly
in
want
of
one
pray
give
her
such
an
estate
that
you
have
in
your
possession
if
you
do
i'll
marry
her
and
take
it
into
my
own
hands
i
might
be
thankful
that
he
did
not
answer
such
a
petition
with
a
horse-whipping
but
if
he
did
not
give
her
his
estate
he
might
extend
to
her
forsooth
his
counsel
and
protection
that
i've
offered
to
do
continued
he
she
may
come
and
live
in
my
house
if
she
will
she
may
do
some
of
the
family
work
i'll
discharge
the
chambermaid
to
make
room
for
her
lizzy
if
i
remember
right
has
a
pretty
face
she
can't
have
a
better
market
for
it
than
as
chambermaid
to
an
inn
if
she
minds
her
p's
and
q's
she
may
make
up
a
handsome
sum
at
the
year's
end
i
thought
it
time
to
break
off
the
conference
and
my
dinner
being
finished
took
my
leave
leaving
behind
me
the
character
of
a
queer
sort
of
chap
i
speeded
to
the
prothonotary's
office
which
was
kept
in
the
village
and
quickly
ascertained
the
truth
of
hadwin's
pretensions
there
existed
a
mortgage
with
bond
and
warrant
of
attorney
to
so
great
an
amount
as
would
swallow
up
every
thing
at
malverton
furnished
with
these
tidings
i
prepared
with
a
drooping
heart
to
return
to
mr
curling's
this
incident
necessarily
produced
a
change
in
my
views
with
regard
to
my
friend
her
fortune
consisted
of
a
few
hundreds
of
dollars
which
frugally
administered
might
procure
decent
accommodation
in
the
country
when
this
was
consumed
she
must
find
subsistence
in
tending
the
big
wheel
or
the
milk-pail
unless
fortune
should
enable
me
to
place
her
in
a
more
favourable
situation
this
state
was
in
some
respects
but
little
different
from
that
in
which
she
had
spent
the
former
part
of
her
life
but
in
her
father's
house
these
employments
were
dignified
by
being
in
some
degree
voluntary
and
relieved
by
frequent
intervals
of
recreation
and
leisure
now
they
were
likely
to
prove
irksome
and
servile
in
consequence
of
being
performed
for
hire
and
imposed
by
necessity
equality
parental
solicitudes
and
sisterly
endearments
would
be
wanting
to
lighten
the
yoke
these
inconveniences
however
were
imaginary
this
was
the
school
in
which
fortitude
and
independence
were
to
be
learned
habit
and
the
purity
of
rural
manners
would
likewise
create
anew
those
ties
which
death
had
dissolved
the
affections
of
parent
and
sister
would
be
supplied
by
the
fonder
and
more
rational
attachments
of
friendship
these
toils
were
not
detrimental
to
beauty
or
health
what
was
to
be
dreaded
from
them
was
their
tendency
to
quench
the
spirit
of
liberal
curiosity
to
habituate
the
person
to
bodily
rather
than
intellectual
exertions
to
supersede
and
create
indifference
or
aversion
to
the
only
instruments
of
rational
improvement
the
pen
and
the
book
this
evil
however
was
at
some
distance
from
eliza
her
present
abode
was
quiet
and
serene
here
she
might
enjoy
domestic
pleasures
and
opportunities
of
mental
improvement
for
the
coming
twelvemonth
at
least
this
period
would
perhaps
be
sufficient
for
the
formation
of
studious
habits
what
schemes
should
be
adopted
for
this
end
would
be
determined
by
the
destiny
to
which
i
myself
should
be
reserved
my
path
was
already
chalked
out
and
my
fancy
now
pursued
it
with
uncommon
pleasure
to
reside
in
your
family
to
study
your
profession
to
pursue
some
subordinate
or
casual
mode
of
industry
by
which
i
might
purchase
leisure
for
medical
pursuits
for
social
recreations
and
for
the
study
of
mankind
on
your
busy
and
thronged
stage
was
the
scope
of
my
wishes
this
destiny
would
not
hinder
punctual
correspondence
and
occasional
visits
to
eliza
her
pen
might
be
called
into
action
and
her
mind
be
awakened
by
books
and
every
hour
be
made
to
add
to
her
stores
of
knowledge
and
enlarge
the
bounds
of
her
capacity
i
was
spiritless
and
gloomy
when
i
left
----
but
reflections
on
my
future
lot
and
just
views
of
the
situation
of
my
friend
insensibly
restored
my
cheerfulness
i
arrived
at
mr
curling's
in
the
evening
and
hastened
to
impart
to
eliza
the
issue
of
my
commission
it
gave
her
uneasiness
merely
as
it
frustrated
the
design
on
which
she
had
fondly
mused
of
residing
in
the
city
she
was
somewhat
consoled
by
my
promises
of
being
her
constant
correspondent
and
occasional
visitor
next
morning
i
set
out
on
my
journey
hither
on
foot
the
way
was
not
long
the
weather
though
cold
was
wholesome
and
serene
my
spirits
were
high
and
i
saw
nothing
in
the
world
before
me
but
sunshine
and
prosperity
i
was
conscious
that
my
happiness
depended
not
on
the
revolutions
of
nature
or
the
caprice
of
man
all
without
was
indeed
vicissitude
and
uncertainty
but
within
my
bosom
was
a
centre
not
to
be
shaken
or
removed
my
purposes
were
honest
and
steadfast
every
sense
was
the
inlet
of
pleasure
because
it
was
the
avenue
of
knowledge
and
my
soul
brooded
over
the
world
to
ideas
and
glowed
with
exultation
at
the
grandeur
and
beauty
of
its
own
creations
this
felicity
was
too
rapturous
to
be
of
long
duration
i
gradually
descended
from
these
heights
and
the
remembrance
of
past
incidents
connected
with
the
images
of
your
family
to
which
i
was
returning
led
my
thoughts
into
a
different
channel
welbeck
and
the
unhappy
girl
whom
he
had
betrayed
mrs
villars
and
wallace
were
recollected
anew
the
views
which
i
had
formed
for
determining
the
fate
and
affording
assistance
to
clemenza
were
recalled
my
former
resolutions
with
regard
to
her
had
been
suspended
by
the
uncertainty
in
which
the
fate
of
the
hadwins
was
at
that
time
wrapped
had
it
not
become
necessary
wholly
to
lay
aside
these
resolutions
that
indeed
was
an
irksome
conclusion
no
wonder
that
i
struggled
to
repel
it
that
i
fostered
the
doubt
whether
money
was
the
only
instrument
of
benefit
whether
caution
and
fortitude
and
knowledge
were
not
the
genuine
preservatives
from
evil
had
i
not
the
means
in
my
hands
of
dispelling
her
fatal
ignorance
of
welbeck
and
of
those
with
whom
she
resided
was
i
not
authorized
by
my
previous
though
slender
intercourse
to
seek
her
presence
suppose
i
should
enter
mrs
villars's
house
desire
to
be
introduced
to
the
lady
accost
her
with
affectionate
simplicity
and
tell
her
the
truth
why
be
anxious
to
smooth
the
way
why
deal
in
apologies
circuities
and
innuendoes
all
these
are
feeble
and
perverse
refinements
unworthy
of
an
honest
purpose
and
an
erect
spirit
to
believe
her
inaccessible
to
my
visit
was
absurd
to
wait
for
the
permission
of
those
whose
interest
it
might
be
to
shut
out
visitants
was
cowardice
this
was
an
infringement
of
her
liberty
which
equity
and
law
equally
condemned
by
what
right
could
she
be
restrained
from
intercourse
with
others
doors
and
passages
may
be
between
her
and
me
with
a
purpose
such
as
mine
no
one
had
a
right
to
close
the
one
or
obstruct
the
other
away
with
cowardly
reluctances
and
clownish
scruples
and
let
me
hasten
this
moment
to
her
dwelling
mrs
villars
is
the
portress
of
the
mansion
she
will
probably
present
herself
before
me
and
demand
the
reason
of
my
visit
what
shall
i
say
to
her
the
truth
to
falter
or
equivocate
or
dissemble
to
this
woman
would
be
wicked
perhaps
her
character
has
been
misunderstood
and
maligned
can
i
render
her
a
greater
service
than
to
apprize
her
of
the
aspersions
that
have
rested
on
it
and
afford
her
the
opportunity
of
vindication
perhaps
she
is
indeed
selfish
and
profligate
the
betrayer
of
youth
and
the
agent
of
lasciviousness
does
she
not
deserve
to
know
the
extent
of
her
errors
and
the
ignominy
of
her
trade
does
she
not
merit
the
compassion
of
the
good
and
the
rebukes
of
the
wise
to
shrink
from
the
task
would
prove
me
cowardly
and
unfirm
thus
far
at
least
let
my
courage
extend
alas
clemenza
is
unacquainted
with
my
language
my
thoughts
cannot
make
themselves
apparent
but
by
words
and
to
my
words
she
will
be
able
to
affix
no
meaning
yet
is
not
that
a
hasty
decision
the
version
from
the
dramas
of
zeno
which
i
found
in
her
toilet
was
probably
hers
and
proves
her
to
have
a
speculative
knowledge
of
our
tongue
near
half
a
year
has
since
elapsed
during
which
she
has
dwelt
with
talkers
of
english
and
consequently
could
not
fail
to
have
acquired
it
this
conclusion
is
somewhat
dubious
but
experiment
will
give
it
certainty
hitherto
i
had
strolled
along
the
path
at
a
lingering
pace
time
enough
methought
to
reach
your
threshold
between
sunrise
and
moonlight
if
my
way
had
been
three
times
longer
than
it
was
you
were
the
pleasing
phantom
that
hovered
before
me
and
beckoned
me
forward
what
a
total
revolution
had
occurred
in
the
course
of
a
few
seconds
for
thus
long
did
my
reasonings
with
regard
to
clemenza
and
the
villars
require
to
pass
through
my
understanding
and
escape
in
half-muttered
soliloquy
from
my
lips
my
muscles
trembled
with
eagerness
and
i
bounded
forward
with
impetuosity
i
saw
nothing
but
a
vista
of
catalpas
leafless
loaded
with
icicles
and
terminating
in
four
chimneys
and
a
painted
roof
my
fancy
outstripped
my
footsteps
and
was
busy
in
picturing
faces
and
rehearsing
dialogues
presently
i
reached
this
new
object
of
my
pursuit
darted
through
the
avenue
noticed
that
some
windows
of
the
house
were
unclosed
drew
thence
a
hasty
inference
that
the
house
was
not
without
inhabitants
and
knocked
quickly
and
loudly
for
admission
some
one
within
crept
to
the
door
opened
it
with
seeming
caution
and
just
far
enough
to
allow
the
face
to
be
seen
it
was
the
timid
pale
and
unwashed
face
of
a
girl
who
was
readily
supposed
to
be
a
servant
taken
from
a
cottage
and
turned
into
a
bringer
of
wood
and
water
and
a
scourer
of
tubs
and
trenches
she
waited
in
timorous
silence
the
delivery
of
my
message
was
mrs
villars
at
home
no
she
has
gone
to
town
were
any
of
her
daughters
within
she
could
not
tell
she
believed--she
thought--which
did
i
want
miss
hetty
or
miss
sally
let
me
see
miss
hetty
saying
this
i
pushed
gently
against
the
door
the
girl
half
reluctant
yielded
way
i
entered
the
passage
and
putting
my
hand
on
the
lock
of
a
door
that
seemed
to
lead
into
a
parlour--is
miss
hetty
in
this
room
no
there
was
nobody
there
go
call
her
then
tell
her
there
is
one
who
wishes
to
see
her
on
important
business
i
will
wait
for
her
coming
in
this
room
so
saying
i
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
apartment
while
the
girl
withdrew
to
perform
my
message
the
parlour
was
spacious
and
expensively
furnished
but
an
air
of
negligence
and
disorder
was
everywhere
visible
the
carpet
was
wrinkled
and
unswept
a
clock
on
the
table
in
a
glass
frame
so
streaked
and
spotted
with
dust
as
scarcely
to
be
transparent
and
the
index
motionless
and
pointing
at
four
instead
of
nine
embers
scattered
on
the
marble
hearth
and
tongs
lying
on
the
fender
with
the
handle
in
the
ashes
a
harpsichord
uncovered
one
end
loaded
with
scores
tumbled
together
in
a
heap
and
the
other
with
volumes
of
novels
and
plays
some
on
their
edges
some
on
their
backs
gaping
open
by
the
scorching
of
their
covers
rent
blurred
stained
blotted
dog-eared
tables
awry
chairs
crowding
each
other
in
short
no
object
but
indicated
the
neglect
or
the
ignorance
of
domestic
neatness
and
economy
my
leisure
was
employed
in
surveying
these
objects
and
in
listening
for
the
approach
of
miss
hetty
some
minutes
elapsed
and
no
one
came
a
reason
for
delay
was
easily
imagined
and
i
summoned
patience
to
wait
i
opened
a
book
touched
the
instrument
surveyed
the
vases
on
the
mantel-tree
the
figures
on
the
hangings
and
the
print
of
apollo
and
the
sibyl
taken
from
salvator
and
hung
over
the
chimney
i
eyed
my
own
shape
and
garb
in
the
mirror
and
asked
how
my
rustic
appearance
would
be
regarded
by
that
supercilious
and
voluptuous
being
to
whom
i
was
about
to
present
myself
presently
the
latch
of
the
door
was
softly
moved
it
opened
and
the
simpleton
before
described
appeared
she
spoke
but
her
voice
was
so
full
of
hesitation
and
so
near
a
whisper
that
much
attention
was
needed
to
make
out
her
words--miss
hetty
was
not
at
home
she
was
gone
to
town
with
her
mistress
this
was
a
tale
not
to
be
credited
how
was
i
to
act
she
persisted
in
maintaining
the
truth
of
it--well
then
said
i
at
length
tell
miss
sally
that
i
wish
to
speak
with
her
she
will
answer
my
purpose
just
as
well
miss
sally
was
not
at
home
neither
she
had
gone
to
town
too
they
would
not
be
back
she
did
not
know
when
not
till
night
she
supposed
it
was
so
indeed
none
of
them
wasn't
at
home
none
but
she
and
nanny
in
the
kitchen
indeed
there
wasn't
go
tell
nanny
to
come
here
i
will
leave
my
message
with
her
she
withdrew
but
nanny
did
not
receive
the
summons
or
thought
proper
not
to
obey
it
all
was
vacant
and
still
my
state
was
singular
and
critical
it
was
absurd
to
prolong
it
but
to
leave
the
house
with
my
errand
unexecuted
would
argue
imbecility
and
folly
to
ascertain
clemenza's
presence
in
this
house
and
to
gain
an
interview
were
yet
in
my
power
had
i
not
boasted
of
my
intrepidity
in
braving
denials
and
commands
when
they
endeavoured
to
obstruct
my
passage
to
this
woman
but
here
were
no
obstacles
nor
prohibition
suppose
the
girl
had
said
truth
that
the
matron
and
her
daughters
were
absent
and
that
nanny
and
herself
were
the
only
guardians
of
the
mansion
so
much
the
better
my
design
will
not
be
opposed
i
have
only
to
mount
the
stair
and
go
from
one
room
to
another
till
i
find
what
i
seek
there
was
hazard
as
well
as
plausibility
in
this
scheme
i
thought
it
best
once
more
to
endeavour
to
extort
information
from
the
girl
and
persuade
her
to
be
my
guide
to
whomsoever
the
house
contained
i
put
my
hand
to
the
bell
and
rung
a
brisk
peal
no
one
came
i
passed
into
the
entry
to
the
foot
of
a
staircase
and
to
a
back-window
nobody
was
within
hearing
or
sight
once
more
i
reflected
on
the
rectitude
of
my
intentions
on
the
possibility
that
the
girl's
assertions
might
be
true
on
the
benefits
of
expedition
and
of
gaining
access
to
the
object
of
my
visit
without
interruption
or
delay
to
these
considerations
was
added
a
sort
of
charm
not
easily
explained
and
by
no
means
justifiable
produced
by
the
very
temerity
and
hazardness
accompanying
this
attempt
i
thought
with
scornful
emotions
on
the
bars
and
hinderances
which
pride
and
caprice
and
delusive
maxims
of
decorum
raise
in
the
way
of
human
intercourse
i
spurned
at
these
semblances
and
substitutes
of
honesty
and
delighted
to
shake
such
fetters
into
air
and
trample
such
impediments
to
dust
i
wanted
to
see
a
human
being
in
order
to
promote
her
happiness
it
was
doubtful
whether
she
was
within
twenty
paces
of
the
spot
where
i
stood
the
doubt
was
to
be
solved
how
by
examining
the
space
i
forthwith
proceeded
to
examine
it
i
reached
the
second
story
i
approached
a
door
that
was
closed
i
knocked
after
a
pause
a
soft
voice
said
who
is
there
the
accents
were
as
musical
as
those
of
clemenza
but
were
in
other
respects
different
i
had
no
topic
to
discuss
with
this
person
i
answered
not
yet
hesitated
to
withdraw
presently
the
same
voice
was
again
heard--what
is
it
you
want
why
don't
you
answer
come
in
i
complied
with
the
command
and
entered
the
room
it
was
deliberation
and
foresight
that
led
me
hither
and
not
chance
or
caprice
hence
instead
of
being
disconcerted
or
vanquished
by
the
objects
that
i
saw
i
was
tranquil
and
firm
my
curiosity
however
made
me
a
vigilant
observer
two
females
arrayed
with
voluptuous
negligence
in
a
manner
adapted
to
the
utmost
seclusion
and
seated
in
a
careless
attitude
on
a
sofa
were
now
discovered
both
darted
glances
at
the
door
one
who
appeared
to
be
the
youngest
no
sooner
saw
me
than
she
shrieked
and
starting
from
her
seat
betrayed
in
the
looks
which
she
successively
cast
upon
me
on
herself
and
on
the
chamber
whose
apparatus
was
in
no
less
confusion
than
that
of
the
apartment
below
her
consciousness
of
the
unseasonableness
of
this
meeting
the
other
shrieked
likewise
but
in
her
it
seemed
to
be
the
token
of
surprise
rather
than
that
of
terror
there
was
probably
somewhat
in
my
aspect
and
garb
that
suggested
an
apology
for
this
intrusion
as
arising
from
simplicity
and
mistake
she
thought
proper
however
to
assume
the
air
of
one
offended
and
looking
sternly--how
now
fellow
said
she
what
is
this
why
come
you
hither
this
questioner
was
of
mature
age
but
had
not
passed
the
period
of
attractiveness
and
grace
all
the
beauty
that
nature
had
bestowed
was
still
retained
but
the
portion
had
never
been
great
what
she
possessed
was
so
modelled
and
embellished
by
such
a
carriage
and
dress
as
to
give
it
most
power
over
the
senses
of
the
gazer
in
proportion
however
as
it
was
intended
and
adapted
to
captivate
those
who
know
none
but
physical
pleasures
it
was
qualified
to
breed
distaste
and
aversion
in
me
i
am
sensible
how
much
error
may
have
lurked
in
this
decision
i
had
brought
with
me
the
belief
of
their
being
unchaste
and
seized
perhaps
with
too
much
avidity
any
appearance
that
coincided
with
my
prepossessions
yet
the
younger
by
no
means
inspired
the
same
disgust
though
i
had
no
reason
to
suppose
her
more
unblemished
than
the
elder
her
modesty
seemed
unaffected
and
was
by
no
means
satisfied
like
that
of
the
elder
with
defeating
future
curiosity
the
consciousness
of
what
had
already
been
exposed
filled
her
with
confusion
and
she
would
have
flown
away
if
her
companion
had
not
detained
her
by
some
degree
of
force
what
ails
the
girl
there's
nothing
to
be
frightened
at
fellow
she
repeated
what
brings
you
here
i
advanced
and
stood
before
them
i
looked
steadfastly
but
i
believe
with
neither
effrontery
nor
anger
on
the
one
who
addressed
me
i
spoke
in
a
tone
serious
and
emphatical
i
come
for
the
sake
of
speaking
to
a
woman
who
formerly
resided
in
this
house
and
probably
resides
here
still
her
name
is
clemenza
lodi
if
she
be
here
i
request
you
to
conduct
me
to
her
instantly
methought
i
perceived
some
inquietude
a
less
imperious
and
more
inquisitive
air
in
this
woman
on
hearing
the
name
of
clemenza
it
was
momentary
and
gave
way
to
peremptory
looks
what
is
your
business
with
her
and
why
did
you
adopt
this
mode
of
inquiry
a
very
extraordinary
intrusion
be
good
enough
to
leave
the
chamber
any
questions
proper
to
be
answered
will
be
answered
below
i
meant
not
to
intrude
or
offend
it
was
not
an
idle
or
impertinent
motive
that
led
me
hither
i
waited
below
for
some
time
after
soliciting
an
audience
of
you
through
the
servant
she
assured
me
you
were
absent
and
laid
me
under
the
necessity
of
searching
for
clemenza
lodi
myself
and
without
a
guide
i
am
anxious
to
withdraw
and
request
merely
to
be
directed
to
the
room
which
she
occupies
i
direct
you
replied
she
in
a
more
resolute
tone
to
quit
the
room
and
the
house
impossible
madam
i
replied
still
looking
at
her
earnestly
leave
the
house
without
seeing
her
you
might
as
well
enjoin
me
to
pull
the
andes
on
my
head--to
walk
barefoot
to
pekin
impossible
some
solicitude
was
now
mingled
with
her
anger
this
is
strange
insolence
unaccountable
behaviour--begone
from
my
room
will
you
compel
me
to
call
the
gentlemen
be
not
alarmed
said
i
with
augmented
mildness
there
was
indeed
compassion
and
sorrow
at
my
heart
and
these
must
have
somewhat
influenced
my
looks
be
not
alarmed
i
came
to
confer
a
benefit
not
to
perpetrate
an
injury
i
came
not
to
censure
or
expostulate
with
you
but
merely
to
counsel
and
aid
a
being
that
needs
both
all
i
want
is
to
see
her
in
this
chamber
i
sought
not
you
but
her
only
lead
me
to
her
or
tell
me
where
she
is
i
will
then
rid
you
of
my
presence
will
you
compel
me
to
call
those
who
will
punish
this
insolence
as
it
deserves
dearest
madam
i
compel
you
to
nothing
i
merely
supplicate
i
would
ask
you
to
lead
me
to
these
gentlemen
if
i
did
not
know
that
there
are
none
but
females
in
the
house
it
is
you
who
must
receive
and
comply
with
my
petition
allow
me
a
moment's
interview
with
clemenza
lodi
compliance
will
harm
you
not
but
will
benefit
her
what
is
your
objection
this
is
the
strangest
proceeding
the
most
singular
conduct
is
this
a
place
fit
to
parley
with
you
i
warn
you
of
the
consequence
of
staying
a
moment
longer
depend
upon
it
you
will
sorely
repent
it
you
are
obdurate
said
i
and
turned
towards
the
younger
who
listened
to
this
discourse
in
tremors
and
panic
i
took
her
hand
with
an
air
of
humility
and
reverence
here
said
i
there
seems
to
be
purity
innocence
and
condescension
i
took
this
house
to
be
the
temple
of
voluptuousness
females
i
expected
to
find
in
it
but
such
only
as
traded
in
licentious
pleasures
specious
perhaps
not
destitute
of
talents
beauty
and
address
but
dissolute
and
wanton
sensual
and
avaricious
yet
in
this
countenance
and
carriage
there
are
tokens
of
virtue
i
am
born
to
be
deceived
and
the
semblance
of
modesty
is
readily
assumed
under
this
veil
perhaps
lurk
a
tainted
heart
and
depraved
appetites
is
it
so
she
made
me
no
answer
but
somewhat
in
her
looks
seemed
to
evince
that
my
favourable
prepossessions
were
just
i
noticed
likewise
that
the
alarm
of
the
elder
was
greatly
increased
by
this
address
to
her
companion
the
thought
suddenly
occurred
that
this
girl
might
be
in
circumstances
not
unlike
those
of
clemenza
lodi
that
she
was
not
apprized
of
the
character
of
her
associates
and
might
by
this
meeting
be
rescued
from
similar
evils
this
suspicion
filled
me
with
tumultuous
feelings
clemenza
was
for
a
time
forgotten
i
paid
no
attention
to
the
looks
or
demeanour
of
the
elder
but
was
wholly
occupied
in
gazing
on
the
younger
my
anxiety
to
know
the
truth
gave
pathos
and
energy
to
my
tones
while
i
spoke--
who
where
what
are
you
do
you
reside
in
this
house
are
you
a
sister
or
daughter
in
this
family
or
merely
a
visitant
do
you
know
the
character
profession
and
views
of
your
companions
do
you
deem
them
virtuous
or
know
them
to
be
profligate
speak
tell
me
i
beseech
you
the
maiden
confusion
which
had
just
appeared
in
the
countenance
of
this
person
now
somewhat
abated
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
glanced
by
turns
at
me
and
at
her
who
sat
by
her
side
an
air
of
serious
astonishment
overspread
her
features
and
she
seemed
anxious
for
me
to
proceed
the
elder
meanwhile
betrayed
the
utmost
alarm
again
upbraided
my
audacity
commanded
me
to
withdraw
and
admonished
me
of
the
danger
i
incurred
by
lingering
i
noticed
not
her
interference
but
again
entreated
to
know
of
the
younger
her
true
state
she
had
no
time
to
answer
me
supposing
her
not
to
want
the
inclination
for
every
pause
was
filled
by
the
clamorous
importunities
and
menaces
of
the
other
i
began
to
perceive
that
my
attempts
were
useless
to
this
end
but
the
chief
and
most
estimable
purpose
was
attainable
it
was
in
my
power
to
state
the
knowledge
i
possessed
through
your
means
of
mrs
villars
and
her
daughters
this
information
might
be
superfluous
since
she
to
whom
it
was
given
might
be
one
of
this
licentious
family
the
contrary
however
was
not
improbable
and
my
tidings
therefore
might
be
of
the
utmost
moment
to
her
safety
a
resolute
and
even
impetuous
manner
reduced
my
incessant
interrupter
to
silence
what
i
had
to
say
i
compressed
in
a
few
words
and
adhered
to
perspicuity
and
candour
with
the
utmost
care
i
still
held
the
hand
that
i
had
taken
and
fixed
my
eyes
upon
her
countenance
with
a
steadfastness
that
hindered
her
from
lifting
her
eyes
i
know
you
not
whether
you
be
dissolute
or
chaste
i
cannot
tell
in
either
case
however
what
i
am
going
to
say
will
be
useful
let
me
faithfully
repeat
what
i
have
heard
it
is
mere
rumour
and
i
vouch
not
for
its
truth
rumour
as
it
is
i
submit
it
to
your
judgment
and
hope
that
it
may
guide
you
into
paths
of
innocence
and
honour
mrs
villars
and
her
three
daughters
are
englishwomen
who
supported
for
a
time
an
unblemished
reputation
but
who
at
length
were
suspected
of
carrying
on
the
trade
of
prostitution
this
secret
could
not
be
concealed
forever
the
profligates
who
frequented
their
house
betrayed
them
one
of
them
who
died
under
their
roof
after
they
had
withdrawn
from
it
into
the
country
disclosed
to
his
kinsman
who
attended
his
death-bed
their
genuine
character
the
dying
man
likewise
related
incidents
in
which
i
am
deeply
concerned
i
have
been
connected
with
one
by
name
welbeck
in
his
house
i
met
an
unfortunate
girl
who
was
afterwards
removed
to
mrs
villars's
her
name
was
clemenza
lodi
residence
in
this
house
under
the
control
of
a
woman
like
mrs
villars
and
her
daughters
must
be
injurious
to
her
innocence
and
from
this
control
i
now
come
to
rescue
her
i
turned
to
the
elder
and
continued--by
all
that
is
sacred
i
adjure
you
to
tell
me
whether
clemenza
lodi
be
under
this
roof
if
she
be
not
whither
has
she
gone
to
know
this
i
came
hither
and
any
difficulty
or
reluctance
in
answering
will
be
useless
till
an
answer
be
obtained
i
will
not
go
hence
during
this
speech
anger
had
been
kindling
in
the
bosom
of
this
woman
it
now
burst
upon
me
in
a
torrent
of
opprobrious
epithets
i
was
a
villain
a
calumniator
a
thief
i
had
lurked
about
the
house
till
those
whose
sex
and
strength
enabled
them
to
cope
with
me
had
gone
i
had
entered
these
doors
by
fraud
i
was
a
wretch
guilty
of
the
last
excesses
of
insolence
and
insult
to
repel
these
reproaches
or
endure
them
was
equally
useless
the
satisfaction
that
i
sought
was
only
to
be
gained
by
searching
the
house
i
left
the
room
without
speaking
did
i
act
illegally
in
passing
from
one
story
and
one
room
to
another
did
i
really
deserve
the
imputations
of
rashness
and
insolence
my
behaviour
i
well
know
was
ambiguous
and
hazardous
and
perhaps
wanting
in
discretion
but
my
motives
were
unquestionably
pure
i
aimed
at
nothing
but
the
rescue
of
a
human
creature
from
distress
and
dishonour
i
pretend
not
to
the
wisdom
of
experience
and
age
to
the
praise
of
forethought
or
subtlety
i
choose
the
obvious
path
and
pursue
it
with
headlong
expedition
good
intentions
unaided
by
knowledge
will
perhaps
produce
more
injury
than
benefit
and
therefore
knowledge
must
be
gained
but
the
acquisition
is
not
momentary
is
not
bestowed
unasked
and
untoiled
for
meanwhile
we
must
not
be
inactive
because
we
are
ignorant
our
good
purposes
must
hurry
to
performance
whether
our
knowledge
be
greater
or
less
to
explore
the
house
in
this
manner
was
so
contrary
to
ordinary
rules
that
the
design
was
probably
wholly
unsuspected
by
the
women
whom
i
had
just
left
my
silence
at
parting
might
have
been
ascribed
by
them
to
the
intimidating
influence
of
invectives
and
threats
hence
i
proceeded
in
my
search
without
interruption
presently
i
reached
a
front
chamber
in
the
third
story
the
door
was
ajar
i
entered
it
on
tiptoe
sitting
on
a
low
chair
by
the
fire
i
beheld
a
female
figure
dressed
in
a
negligent
but
not
indecent
manner
her
face
in
the
posture
in
which
she
sat
was
only
half
seen
its
hues
were
sickly
and
pale
and
in
mournful
unison
with
a
feeble
and
emaciated
form
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
a
babe
that
lay
stretched
upon
a
pillow
at
her
feet
the
child
like
its
mother
for
such
she
was
readily
imagined
to
be
was
meagre
and
cadaverous
either
it
was
dead
or
could
not
be
very
distant
from
death
the
features
of
clemenza
were
easily
recognised
though
no
contrast
could
be
greater
in
habit
and
shape
and
complexion
than
that
which
her
present
bore
to
her
former
appearance
all
her
roses
had
faded
and
her
brilliancies
vanished
still
however
there
was
somewhat
fitted
to
awaken
the
tenderest
emotions
there
were
tokens
of
inconsolable
distress
her
attention
was
wholly
absorbed
by
the
child
she
lifted
not
her
eyes
till
i
came
close
to
her
and
stood
before
her
when
she
discovered
me
a
faint
start
was
perceived
she
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
then
putting
one
spread
hand
before
her
eyes
she
stretched
out
the
other
towards
the
door
and
waving
it
in
silence
as
if
to
admonish
me
to
depart
this
motion
however
emphatical
i
could
not
obey
i
wished
to
obtain
her
attention
but
knew
not
in
what
words
to
claim
it
i
was
silent
in
a
moment
she
removed
her
hand
from
her
eyes
and
looked
at
me
with
new
eagerness
her
features
bespoke
emotions
which
perhaps
flowed
from
my
likeness
to
her
brother
joined
with
the
memory
of
my
connection
with
welbeck
my
situation
was
full
of
embarrassment
i
was
by
no
means
certain
that
my
language
would
be
understood
i
knew
not
in
what
light
the
policy
and
dissimulation
of
welbeck
might
have
taught
her
to
regard
me
what
proposal
conducive
to
her
comfort
and
her
safety
could
i
make
to
her
once
more
she
covered
her
eyes
and
exclaimed
in
a
feeble
voice
go
away
begone
as
if
satisfied
with
this
effort
she
resumed
her
attention
to
her
child
she
stooped
and
lifted
it
in
her
arms
gazing
meanwhile
on
its
almost
lifeless
features
with
intense
anxiety
she
crushed
it
to
her
bosom
and
again
looking
at
me
repeated
go
away
go
away
begone
there
was
somewhat
in
the
lines
of
her
face
in
her
tones
and
gestures
that
pierced
to
my
heart
added
to
this
was
my
knowledge
of
her
condition
her
friendlessness
her
poverty
the
pangs
of
unrequited
love
and
her
expiring
infant
i
felt
my
utterance
choked
and
my
tears
struggling
for
passage
i
turned
to
the
window
and
endeavoured
to
regain
my
tranquillity
what
was
it
said
i
that
brought
me
hither
the
perfidy
of
welbeck
must
surely
have
long
since
been
discovered
what
can
i
tell
her
of
the
villars
which
she
does
not
already
know
or
of
which
the
knowledge
will
be
useful
if
their
treatment
has
been
just
why
should
i
detract
from
their
merit
if
it
has
been
otherwise
their
own
conduct
will
have
disclosed
their
genuine
character
though
voluptuous
themselves
it
does
not
follow
that
they
have
laboured
to
debase
this
creature
though
wanton
they
may
not
be
inhuman
i
can
propose
no
change
in
her
condition
for
the
better
should
she
be
willing
to
leave
this
house
whither
is
it
in
my
power
to
conduct
her
oh
that
i
were
rich
enough
to
provide
food
for
the
hungry
shelter
for
the
houseless
and
raiment
for
the
naked
i
was
roused
from
these
fruitless
reflections
by
the
lady
whom
some
sudden
thought
induced
to
place
the
child
in
its
bed
and
rising
to
come
towards
me
the
utter
dejection
which
her
features
lately
betrayed
was
now
changed
for
an
air
of
anxious
curiosity
where
said
she
in
her
broken
english--where
is
signor
welbeck
alas
returned
i
i
know
not
that
question
might
i
thought
with
more
propriety
be
put
to
you
than
me
i
know
where
he
be
i
fear
where
he
be
so
saying
the
deepest
sighs
burst
from
her
heart
she
turned
from
me
and
going
to
the
child
took
it
again
into
her
lap
its
pale
and
sunken
cheek
was
quickly
wet
with
the
mother's
tears
which
as
she
silently
hung
over
it
dropped
fast
from
her
eyes
this
demeanour
could
not
but
awaken
curiosity
while
it
gave
a
new
turn
to
my
thoughts
i
began
to
suspect
that
in
the
tokens
which
i
saw
there
was
not
only
distress
for
her
child
but
concern
for
the
fate
of
welbeck
know
you
said
i
where
mr
welbeck
is
is
he
alive
is
he
near
is
he
in
calamity
i
do
not
know
if
he
be
alive
he
be
sick
he
be
in
prison
they
will
not
let
me
go
to
him
and--here
her
attention
and
mine
was
attracted
by
the
infant
whose
frame
till
now
motionless
began
to
be
tremulous
its
features
sunk
into
a
more
ghastly
expression
its
breathings
were
difficult
and
every
effort
to
respire
produced
a
convulsion
harder
than
the
last
the
mother
easily
interpreted
these
tokens
the
same
mortal
struggle
seemed
to
take
place
in
her
features
as
in
those
of
her
child
at
length
her
agony
found
way
in
a
piercing
shriek
the
struggle
in
the
infant
was
past
hope
looked
in
vain
for
a
new
motion
in
its
heart
or
its
eyelids
the
lips
were
closed
and
its
breath
was
gone
forever
the
grief
which
overwhelmed
the
unhappy
parent
was
of
that
outrageous
and
desperate
kind
which
is
wholly
incompatible
with
thinking
a
few
incoherent
motions
and
screams
that
rent
the
soul
were
followed
by
a
deep
swoon
she
sunk
upon
the
floor
pale
and
lifeless
as
her
babe
i
need
not
describe
the
pangs
which
such
a
scene
was
adapted
to
produce
in
me
these
were
rendered
more
acute
by
the
helpless
and
ambiguous
situation
in
which
i
was
placed
i
was
eager
to
bestow
consolation
and
succour
but
was
destitute
of
all
means
i
was
plunged
into
uncertainties
and
doubts
i
gazed
alternately
at
the
infant
and
its
mother
i
sighed
i
wept
i
even
sobbed
i
stooped
down
and
took
the
lifeless
hand
of
the
sufferer
i
bathed
it
with
my
tears
and
exclaimed
ill-fated
woman
unhappy
mother
what
shall
i
do
for
thy
relief
how
shall
i
blunt
the
edge
of
this
calamity
and
rescue
thee
from
new
evils
at
this
moment
the
door
of
the
apartment
was
opened
and
the
younger
of
the
women
whom
i
had
seen
below
entered
her
looks
betrayed
the
deepest
consternation
and
anxiety
her
eyes
in
a
moment
were
fixed
by
the
decayed
form
and
the
sad
features
of
clemenza
she
shuddered
at
this
spectacle
but
was
silent
she
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
floor
fluctuating
and
bewildered
i
dropped
the
hand
that
i
was
holding
and
approached
her
you
have
come
said
i
in
good
season
i
know
you
not
but
will
believe
you
to
be
good
you
have
a
heart
it
may
be
not
free
from
corruption
but
it
is
still
capable
of
pity
for
the
miseries
of
others
you
have
a
hand
that
refuses
not
its
aid
to
the
unhappy
see
there
is
an
infant
dead
there
is
a
mother
whom
grief
has
for
a
time
deprived
of
life
she
has
been
oppressed
and
betrayed
been
robbed
of
property
and
reputation--but
not
of
innocence
she
is
worthy
of
relief
have
you
arms
to
receive
her
have
you
sympathy
protection
and
a
home
to
bestow
upon
a
forlorn
betrayed
and
unhappy
stranger
i
know
not
what
this
house
is
i
suspect
it
to
be
no
better
than
a
brothel
i
know
not
what
treatment
this
woman
has
received
when
her
situation
and
wants
are
ascertained
will
you
supply
her
wants
will
you
rescue
her
from
evils
that
may
attend
her
continuance
here
she
was
disconcerted
and
bewildered
by
this
address
at
length
she
said
all
that
has
happened
all
that
i
have
heard
and
seen
is
so
unexpected
so
strange
that
i
am
amazed
and
distracted
your
behaviour
i
cannot
comprehend
nor
your
motive
for
making
this
address
to
me
i
cannot
answer
you
except
in
one
respect
if
this
woman
has
suffered
injury
i
have
had
no
part
in
it
i
knew
not
of
her
existence
nor
her
situation
till
this
moment
and
whatever
protection
or
assistance
she
may
justly
claim
i
am
both
able
and
willing
to
bestow
i
do
not
live
here
but
in
the
city
i
am
only
an
occasional
visitant
in
this
house
what
then
i
exclaimed
with
sparkling
eyes
and
a
rapturous
accent
you
are
not
profligate
are
a
stranger
to
the
manners
of
this
house
and
a
detester
of
these
manners
be
not
a
deceiver
i
entreat
you
i
depend
only
on
your
looks
and
professions
and
these
may
be
dissembled
these
questions
which
indeed
argued
a
childish
simplicity
excited
her
surprise
she
looked
at
me
uncertain
whether
i
was
in
earnest
or
in
jest
at
length
she
said
your
language
is
so
singular
that
i
am
at
a
loss
how
to
answer
it
i
shall
take
no
pains
to
find
out
its
meaning
but
leave
you
to
form
conjectures
at
leisure
who
is
this
woman
and
how
can
i
serve
her
after
a
pause
she
continued--i
cannot
afford
her
any
immediate
assistance
and
shall
not
stay
a
moment
longer
in
this
house
there
putting
a
card
in
my
hand
is
my
name
and
place
of
abode
if
you
shall
have
any
proposals
to
make
respecting
this
woman
i
shall
be
ready
to
receive
them
in
my
own
house
so
saying
she
withdrew
i
looked
wistfully
after
her
but
could
not
but
assent
to
her
assertion
that
her
presence
here
would
be
more
injurious
to
her
than
beneficial
to
clemenza
she
had
scarcely
gone
when
the
elder
woman
entered
there
was
rage
sullenness
and
disappointment
in
her
aspect
these
however
were
suspended
by
the
situation
in
which
she
discovered
the
mother
and
child
it
was
plain
that
all
the
sentiments
of
woman
were
not
extinguished
in
her
heart
she
summoned
the
servants
and
seemed
preparing
to
take
such
measures
as
the
occasion
prescribed
i
now
saw
the
folly
of
supposing
that
these
measures
would
be
neglected
and
that
my
presence
could
not
essentially
contribute
to
the
benefit
of
the
sufferer
still
however
i
lingered
in
the
room
till
the
infant
was
covered
with
a
cloth
and
the
still
senseless
parent
was
conveyed
into
an
adjoining
chamber
the
woman
then
as
if
she
had
not
seen
me
before
fixed
scowling
eyes
upon
me
and
exclaimed
thief
villain
why
do
you
stay
here
i
mean
to
go
said
i
but
not
till
i
express
my
gratitude
and
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
your
attention
to
this
sufferer
you
deem
me
insolent
and
perverse
but
i
am
not
such
and
hope
that
the
day
will
come
when
i
shall
convince
you
of
my
good
intentions
begone
interrupted
she
in
a
more
angry
tone
begone
this
moment
or
i
will
treat
you
as
a
thief
she
now
drew
forth
her
hand
from
under
her
gown
and
showed
a
pistol
you
shall
see
she
continued
that
i
will
not
be
insulted
with
impunity
if
you
do
not
vanish
i
will
shoot
you
as
a
robber
this
woman
was
far
from
wanting
a
force
and
intrepidity
worthy
of
a
different
sex
her
gestures
and
tones
were
full
of
energy
they
denoted
a
haughty
and
indignant
spirit
it
was
plain
that
she
conceived
herself
deeply
injured
by
my
conduct
and
was
it
absolutely
certain
that
her
anger
was
without
reason
i
had
loaded
her
house
with
atrocious
imputations
and
these
imputations
might
be
false
i
had
conceived
them
upon
such
evidence
as
chance
had
provided
but
this
evidence
intricate
and
dubious
as
human
actions
and
motives
are
might
be
void
of
truth
perhaps
said
i
in
a
sedate
tone
i
have
injured
you
i
have
mistaken
your
character
you
shall
not
find
me
less
ready
to
repair
than
to
perpetrate
this
injury
my
error
was
without
malice
and----
i
had
not
time
to
finish
the
sentence
when
this
rash
and
enraged
woman
thrust
the
pistol
close
to
my
head
and
fired
it
i
was
wholly
unaware
that
her
fury
would
lead
her
to
this
excess
it
was
a
sort
of
mechanical
impulse
that
made
me
raise
my
hand
and
attempt
to
turn
aside
the
weapon
i
did
this
deliberately
and
tranquilly
and
without
conceiving
that
any
thing
more
was
intended
by
her
movement
than
to
intimidate
me
to
this
precaution
however
i
was
indebted
for
life
the
bullet
was
diverted
from
my
forehead
to
my
left
ear
and
made
a
slight
wound
upon
the
surface
from
which
the
blood
gushed
in
a
stream
the
loudness
of
this
explosion
and
the
shock
which
the
ball
produced
in
my
brain
sunk
me
into
a
momentary
stupor
i
reeled
backward
and
should
have
fallen
had
not
i
supported
myself
against
the
wall
the
sight
of
my
blood
instantly
restored
her
reason
her
rage
disappeared
and
was
succeeded
by
terror
and
remorse
she
clasped
her
hands
and
exclaimed
oh
what
what
have
i
done
my
frantic
passion
has
destroyed
me
i
needed
no
long
time
to
show
me
the
full
extent
of
the
injury
which
i
had
suffered
and
the
conduct
which
it
became
me
to
adopt
for
a
moment
i
was
bewildered
and
alarmed
but
presently
perceived
that
this
was
an
incident
more
productive
of
good
than
of
evil
it
would
teach
me
caution
in
contending
with
the
passions
of
another
and
showed
me
that
there
is
a
limit
which
the
impetuosities
of
anger
will
sometimes
overstep
instead
of
reviling
my
companion
i
addressed
myself
to
her
thus--
be
not
frighted
you
have
done
me
no
injury
and
i
hope
will
derive
instruction
from
this
event
your
rashness
had
like
to
have
sacrificed
the
life
of
one
who
is
your
friend
and
to
have
exposed
yourself
to
infamy
and
death
or
at
least
to
the
pangs
of
eternal
remorse
learn
from
hence
to
curb
your
passions
and
especially
to
keep
at
a
distance
from
every
murderous
weapon
on
occasions
when
rage
is
likely
to
take
place
of
reason
i
repeat
that
my
motives
in
entering
this
house
were
connected
with
your
happiness
as
well
as
that
of
clemenza
lodi
if
i
have
erred
in
supposing
you
the
member
of
a
vile
and
pernicious
trade
that
error
was
worthy
of
being
rectified
but
violence
and
invective
tend
only
to
confirm
it
i
am
incapable
of
any
purpose
that
is
not
beneficent
but
in
the
means
that
i
use
and
in
the
evidence
on
which
i
proceed
i
am
liable
to
a
thousand
mistakes
point
out
to
me
the
road
by
which
i
can
do
you
good
and
i
will
cheerfully
pursue
it
finding
that
her
fears
had
been
groundless
as
to
the
consequences
of
her
rashness
she
renewed
though
with
less
vehemence
than
before
her
imprecations
on
my
intermeddling
and
audacious
folly
i
listened
till
the
storm
was
nearly
exhausted
and
then
declaring
my
intention
to
revisit
the
house
if
the
interest
of
clemenza
should
require
it
i
resumed
my
way
to
the
city
why
said
i
as
i
hasted
forward
is
my
fortune
so
abundant
in
unforeseen
occurrences
is
every
man
who
leaves
his
cottage
and
the
impressions
of
his
infancy
behind
him
ushered
into
such
a
world
of
revolutions
and
perils
as
have
trammelled
my
steps
or
is
my
scene
indebted
for
variety
and
change
to
my
propensity
to
look
into
other
people's
concerns
and
to
make
their
sorrows
and
their
joys
mine
to
indulge
an
adventurous
spirit
i
left
the
precincts
of
the
barn-door
enlisted
in
the
service
of
a
stranger
and
encountered
a
thousand
dangers
to
my
virtue
under
the
disastrous
influence
of
welbeck
afterwards
my
life
was
set
at
hazard
in
the
cause
of
wallace
and
now
am
i
loaded
with
the
province
of
protecting
the
helpless
eliza
hadwin
and
the
unfortunate
clemenza
my
wishes
are
fervent
and
my
powers
shall
not
be
inactive
in
their
defence
but
how
slender
are
these
powers
in
the
offers
of
the
unknown
lady
there
is
indeed
some
consolation
for
clemenza
it
must
be
my
business
to
lay
before
my
friend
stevens
the
particulars
of
what
has
befallen
me
and
to
entreat
his
directions
how
this
disconsolate
girl
may
be
most
effectually
succoured
it
may
be
wise
to
take
her
from
her
present
abode
and
place
her
under
some
chaste
and
humane
guardianship
where
she
may
gradually
lose
remembrance
of
her
dead
infant
and
her
specious
betrayer
the
barrier
that
severs
her
from
welbeck
must
be
high
as
heaven
and
insuperable
as
necessity
but
soft
talked
she
not
of
welbeck
said
she
not
that
he
was
in
prison
and
was
sick
poor
wretch
i
thought
thy
course
was
at
an
end
that
the
penalty
of
guilt
no
longer
weighed
down
thy
heart
that
thy
misdeeds
and
thy
remorses
were
buried
in
a
common
and
obscure
grave
but
it
seems
thou
art
still
alive
is
it
rational
to
cherish
the
hope
of
thy
restoration
to
innocence
and
peace
thou
art
no
obdurate
criminal
hadst
thou
less
virtue
thy
compunctions
would
be
less
keen
wert
thou
deaf
to
the
voice
of
duty
thy
wanderings
into
guilt
and
folly
would
be
less
fertile
of
anguish
the
time
will
perhaps
come
when
the
measure
of
thy
transgressions
and
calamities
will
overflow
and
the
folly
of
thy
choice
will
be
too
conspicuous
to
escape
thy
discernment
surely
even
for
such
transgressors
as
thou
there
is
a
salutary
power
in
the
precepts
of
truth
and
the
lessons
of
experience
but
thou
art
imprisoned
and
art
sick
this
perhaps
is
the
crisis
of
thy
destiny
indigence
and
dishonour
were
the
evils
to
shun
which
thy
integrity
and
peace
of
mind
have
been
lightly
forfeited
thou
hast
found
that
the
price
was
given
in
vain
that
the
hollow
and
deceitful
enjoyments
of
opulence
and
dignity
were
not
worth
the
purchase
and
that
frivolous
and
unsubstantial
as
they
are
the
only
path
that
leads
to
them
is
that
of
honesty
and
diligence
thou
art
in
prison
and
art
sick
and
there
is
none
to
cheer
thy
hour
with
offices
of
kindness
or
uphold
thy
fainting
courage
by
the
suggestions
of
good
counsel
for
such
as
thou
the
world
has
no
compassion
mankind
will
pursue
thee
to
the
grave
with
execrations
their
cruelty
will
be
justified
or
palliated
since
they
know
thee
not
they
are
unacquainted
with
the
goadings
of
thy
conscience
and
the
bitter
retributions
which
thou
art
daily
suffering
they
are
full
of
their
own
wrongs
and
think
only
of
those
tokens
of
exultation
and
complacency
which
thou
wast
studious
of
assuming
in
thy
intercourse
with
them
it
is
i
only
that
thoroughly
know
thee
and
can
rightly
estimate
thy
claims
to
compassion
i
have
somewhat
partaken
of
thy
kindness
and
thou
meritest
some
gratitude
at
my
hands
shall
i
not
visit
and
endeavour
to
console
thee
in
thy
distress
let
me
at
least
ascertain
thy
condition
and
be
the
instrument
in
repairing
the
wrongs
which
thou
hast
inflicted
let
me
gain
from
the
contemplation
of
thy
misery
new
motives
to
sincerity
and
rectitude
while
occupied
by
these
reflections
i
entered
the
city
the
thoughts
which
engrossed
my
mind
related
to
welbeck
it
is
not
my
custom
to
defer
till
to-morrow
what
can
be
done
to-day
the
destiny
of
man
frequently
hangs
upon
the
lapse
of
a
minute
i
will
stop
said
i
at
the
prison
and
since
the
moment
of
my
arrival
may
not
be
indifferent
i
will
go
thither
with
all
possible
haste
i
did
not
content
myself
with
walking
but
regardless
of
the
comments
of
passengers
hurried
along
the
way
at
full
speed
having
inquired
for
welbeck
i
was
conducted
through
a
dark
room
crowded
with
beds
to
a
staircase
never
before
had
i
been
in
a
prison
never
had
i
smelt
so
noisome
an
odour
or
surveyed
faces
so
begrimed
with
filth
and
misery
the
walls
and
floors
were
alike
squalid
and
detestable
it
seemed
that
in
this
house
existence
would
be
bereaved
of
all
its
attractions
and
yet
those
faces
which
could
be
seen
through
the
obscurity
that
encompassed
them
were
either
void
of
care
or
distorted
with
mirth
this
said
i
as
i
followed
my
conductor
is
the
residence
of
welbeck
what
contrasts
are
these
to
the
repose
and
splendour
pictured
walls
glossy
hangings
gilded
sofas
mirrors
that
occupied
from
ceiling
to
floor
carpets
of
tauris
and
the
spotless
and
transcendent
brilliancy
of
coverlets
and
napkins
in
thy
former
dwelling
here
brawling
and
the
shuffling
of
rude
feet
are
eternal
the
air
is
loaded
with
the
exhalations
of
disease
and
the
fumes
of
debauchery
thou
art
cooped
up
in
airless
space
and
perhaps
compelled
to
share
thy
narrow
cell
with
some
stupid
ruffian
formerly
the
breezes
were
courted
by
thy
lofty
windows
aromatic
shrubs
were
scattered
on
thy
hearth
menials
splendid
in
apparel
showed
their
faces
with
diffidence
in
thy
apartment
trod
lightly
on
thy
marble
floor
and
suffered
not
the
sanctity
of
silence
to
be
troubled
by
a
whisper
thy
lamp
shot
its
rays
through
the
transparency
of
alabaster
and
thy
fragrant
lymph
flowed
from
vases
of
porcelain
such
were
formerly
the
decorations
of
thy
hall
the
embellishments
of
thy
existence
but
now--alas----
we
reached
a
chamber
in
the
second
story
my
conductor
knocked
at
the
door
no
one
answered
repeated
knocks
were
unheard
or
unnoticed
by
the
person
within
at
length
lifting
a
latch
we
entered
together
the
prisoner
lay
upon
the
bed
with
his
face
turned
from
the
door
i
advanced
softly
making
a
sign
to
the
keeper
to
withdraw
welbeck
was
not
asleep
but
merely
buried
in
reverie
i
was
unwilling
to
disturb
his
musing
and
stood
with
my
eyes
fixed
upon
his
form
he
appeared
unconscious
that
any
one
had
entered
at
length
uttering
a
deep
sigh
he
changed
his
posture
and
perceived
me
in
my
motionless
and
gazing
attitude
recollect
in
what
circumstances
we
had
last
parted
welbeck
had
no
doubt
carried
away
with
him
from
that
interview
a
firm
belief
that
i
should
speedily
die
his
prognostic
however
was
fated
to
be
contradicted
his
first
emotions
were
those
of
surprise
these
gave
place
to
mortification
and
rage
after
eyeing
me
for
some
time
he
averted
his
glances
and
that
effort
which
is
made
to
dissipate
some
obstacle
to
breathing
showed
me
that
his
sensations
were
of
the
most
excruciating
kind
he
laid
his
head
upon
the
pillow
and
sunk
into
his
former
musing
he
disdained
or
was
unable
to
utter
a
syllable
of
welcome
or
contempt
in
the
opportunity
that
had
been
afforded
me
to
view
his
countenance
i
had
observed
tokens
of
a
kind
very
different
from
those
which
used
to
be
visible
the
gloomy
and
malignant
were
more
conspicuous
health
had
forsaken
his
cheeks
and
taken
along
with
it
those
flexible
parts
which
formerly
enabled
him
to
cover
his
secret
torments
and
insidious
purposes
beneath
a
veil
of
benevolence
and
cheerfulness
alas
said
i
loud
enough
for
him
to
hear
me
here
is
a
monument
of
ruin
despair
and
mischievous
passions
are
too
deeply
rooted
in
this
heart
for
me
to
tear
them
away
these
expressions
did
not
escape
his
notice
he
turned
once
more
and
cast
sullen
looks
upon
me
there
was
somewhat
in
his
eyes
that
made
me
shudder
they
denoted
that
his
reverie
was
not
that
of
grief
but
of
madness
i
continued
in
a
less
steadfast
voice
than
before--
unhappy
clemenza
i
have
performed
thy
message
i
have
visited
him
that
is
sick
and
in
prison
thou
hadst
cause
for
anguish
and
terror
even
greater
cause
than
thou
imaginedst
would
to
god
that
thou
wouldst
be
contented
with
the
report
which
i
shall
make
that
thy
misguided
tenderness
would
consent
to
leave
him
to
his
destiny
would
suffer
him
to
die
alone
but
that
is
a
forbearance
which
no
eloquence
that
i
possess
will
induce
thee
to
practise
thou
must
come
and
witness
for
thyself
in
speaking
thus
i
was
far
from
foreseeing
the
effects
which
would
be
produced
on
the
mind
of
welbeck
i
was
far
from
intending
to
instil
into
him
a
belief
that
clemenza
was
near
at
hand
and
was
preparing
to
enter
his
apartment
yet
no
other
images
but
these
would
perhaps
have
roused
him
from
his
lethargy
and
awakened
that
attention
which
i
wished
to
awaken
he
started
up
and
gazed
fearfully
at
the
door
what
he
cried
what
is
she
here
ye
powers
that
have
scattered
woes
in
my
path
spare
me
the
sight
of
her
but
from
this
agony
i
will
rescue
myself
the
moment
she
appears
i
will
pluck
out
these
eyes
and
dash
them
at
her
feet
so
saying
he
gazed
with
augmented
eagerness
upon
the
door
his
hands
were
lifted
to
his
head
as
if
ready
to
execute
his
frantic
purpose
i
seized
his
arm
and
besought
him
to
lay
aside
his
terror
for
that
clemenza
was
far
distant
she
had
no
intention
and
besides
was
unable
to
visit
him
then
i
am
respited
i
breathe
again
no
keep
her
from
a
prison
drag
her
to
the
wheel
or
to
the
scaffold
mangle
her
with
stripes
torture
her
with
famine
strangle
her
child
before
her
face
and
cast
it
to
the
hungry
dogs
that
are
howling
at
the
gate
but--keep
her
from
a
prison
never
let
her
enter
these
doors
there
he
stopped
his
eyes
being
fixed
on
the
floor
and
his
thoughts
once
more
buried
in
reverie
i
resumed--
she
is
occupied
with
other
griefs
than
those
connected
with
the
fate
of
welbeck
she
is
not
unmindful
of
you
she
knows
you
to
be
sick
and
in
prison
and
i
came
to
do
for
you
whatever
office
your
condition
might
require
and
i
came
at
her
suggestion
she
alas
has
full
employment
for
her
tears
in
watering
the
grave
of
her
child
he
started
what
dead
say
you
that
the
child
is
dead
it
is
dead
i
witnessed
its
death
i
saw
it
expire
in
the
arms
of
its
mother
that
mother
whom
i
formerly
met
under
your
roof
blooming
and
gay
but
whom
calamity
has
tarnished
and
withered
i
saw
her
in
the
raiment
of
poverty
under
an
accursed
roof
desolate
alone
unsolaced
by
the
countenance
or
sympathy
of
human
beings
approached
only
by
those
who
mock
at
her
distress
set
snares
for
her
innocence
and
push
her
to
infamy
i
saw
her
leaning
over
the
face
of
her
dying
babe
welbeck
put
his
hands
to
his
head
and
exclaimed
curses
on
thy
lips
infernal
messenger
chant
elsewhere
thy
rueful
ditty
vanish
if
thou
wouldst
not
feel
in
thy
heart
fangs
red
with
blood
less
guilty
than
thine
till
this
moment
the
uproar
in
welbeck's
mind
appeared
to
hinder
him
from
distinctly
recognising
his
visitant
now
it
seemed
as
if
the
incidents
of
our
last
interview
suddenly
sprung
up
in
his
remembrance
what
this
is
the
villain
that
rifled
my
cabinet
the
maker
of
my
poverty
and
of
all
the
evils
which
it
has
since
engendered
that
has
led
me
to
a
prison
execrable
fool
you
are
the
author
of
the
scene
that
you
describe
and
of
horrors
without
number
and
name
to
whatever
crimes
i
have
been
urged
since
that
interview
and
the
fit
of
madness
that
made
you
destroy
my
property
they
spring
from
your
act
they
flowed
from
necessity
which
had
you
held
your
hand
at
that
fateful
moment
would
never
have
existed
how
dare
you
thrust
yourself
upon
my
privacy
why
am
i
not
alone
fly
and
let
my
miseries
want
at
least
the
aggravation
of
beholding
their
author
my
eyes
loathe
the
sight
of
thee
my
heart
would
suffocate
thee
with
its
own
bitterness
begone
i
know
not
i
answered
why
innocence
should
tremble
at
the
ravings
of
a
lunatic
why
it
should
be
overwhelmed
by
unmerited
reproaches
why
it
should
not
deplore
the
errors
of
its
foe
labour
to
correct
those
errors
and----
thank
thy
fate
youth
that
my
hands
are
tied
up
by
my
scorn
thank
thy
fate
that
no
weapon
is
within
reach
much
has
passed
since
i
saw
thee
and
i
am
a
new
man
i
am
no
longer
inconstant
and
cowardly
i
have
no
motives
but
contempt
to
hinder
me
from
expiating
the
wrongs
which
thou
hast
done
me
in
thy
blood
i
disdain
to
take
thy
life
go
and
let
thy
fidelity
at
least
to
the
confidence
which
i
have
placed
in
thee
be
inviolate
thou
hast
done
me
harm
enough
but
canst
do
if
thou
wilt
still
more
thou
canst
betray
the
secrets
that
are
lodged
in
thy
bosom
and
rob
me
of
the
comfort
of
reflecting
that
my
guilt
is
known
but
to
one
among
the
living
this
suggestion
made
me
pause
and
look
back
upon
the
past
i
had
confided
this
man's
tale
to
you
the
secrecy
on
which
he
so
fondly
leaned
was
at
an
end
had
i
acted
culpably
or
not
but
why
should
i
ruminate
with
anguish
and
doubt
upon
the
past
the
future
was
within
my
power
and
the
road
of
my
duty
was
too
plain
to
be
mistaken
i
would
disclose
to
welbeck
the
truth
and
cheerfully
encounter
every
consequence
i
would
summon
my
friend
to
my
aid
and
take
his
counsel
in
the
critical
emergency
in
which
i
was
placed
i
ought
not
to
rely
upon
myself
alone
in
my
efforts
to
benefit
this
being
when
another
was
so
near
whose
discernment
and
benevolence
and
knowledge
of
mankind
and
power
of
affording
relief
were
far
superior
to
mine
influenced
by
these
thoughts
i
left
the
apartment
without
speaking
and
procuring
pen
and
paper
despatched
to
you
the
billet
which
brought
about
our
meeting
mervyn's
auditors
allowed
no
pause
in
their
attention
to
this
story
having
ended
a
deep
silence
took
place
the
clock
which
stood
upon
the
mantel
had
sounded
twice
the
customary
larum
but
had
not
been
heard
by
us
it
was
now
struck
a
third
time
it
was
one
our
guest
appeared
somewhat
startled
at
this
signal
and
looked
with
a
mournful
sort
of
earnestness
at
the
clock
there
was
an
air
of
inquietude
about
him
which
i
had
never
observed
in
an
equal
degree
before
i
was
not
without
much
curiosity
respecting
other
incidents
than
those
which
had
just
been
related
by
him
but
after
so
much
fatigue
as
he
had
undergone
i
thought
it
improper
to
prolong
the
conversation
come
said
i
my
friend
let
us
to
bed
this
is
a
drowsy
time
and
after
so
much
exercise
of
mind
and
body
you
cannot
but
need
some
repose
much
has
happened
in
your
absence
which
is
proper
to
be
known
to
you
but
our
discourse
will
be
best
deferred
till
to-morrow
i
will
come
into
your
chamber
by
day-dawn
and
unfold
to
you
particulars
nay
said
he
withdraw
not
on
my
account
if
i
go
to
my
chamber
it
will
not
be
to
sleep
but
to
meditate
especially
after
your
assurance
that
something
of
moment
has
occurred
in
my
absence
my
thoughts
independently
of
any
cause
of
sorrow
or
fear
have
received
an
impulse
which
solitude
and
darkness
will
not
stop
it
is
impossible
to
know
too
much
for
our
safety
and
integrity
or
to
know
it
too
soon
what
has
happened
i
did
not
hesitate
to
comply
with
his
request
for
it
was
not
difficult
to
conceive
that
however
tired
the
limbs
might
be
the
adventures
of
this
day
would
not
be
easily
expelled
from
the
memory
at
night
i
told
him
the
substance
of
the
conversation
with
mrs
althorpe
he
smiled
at
those
parts
of
the
narrative
which
related
to
himself
but
when
his
father's
depravity
and
poverty
were
mentioned
he
melted
into
tears
poor
wretch
i
that
knew
thee
in
thy
better
days
might
have
easily
divined
this
consequence
i
foresaw
thy
poverty
and
degradation
in
the
same
hour
that
i
left
thy
roof
my
soul
drooped
at
the
prospect
but
i
said
it
cannot
be
prevented
and
this
reflection
was
an
antidote
to
grief
but
now
that
thy
ruin
is
complete
it
seems
as
if
some
of
it
were
imputable
to
me
who
forsook
thee
when
the
succour
and
counsel
of
a
son
were
most
needed
thou
art
ignorant
and
vicious
but
thou
art
my
father
still
i
see
that
the
sufferings
of
a
better
man
than
thou
art
would
less
afflict
me
than
thine
perhaps
it
is
still
in
my
power
to
restore
thy
liberty
and
good
name
and
yet--that
is
a
fond
wish
thou
art
past
the
age
when
the
ignorance
and
grovelling
habits
of
a
human
being
are
susceptible
of
cure
there
he
stopped
and
after
a
gloomy
pause
continued--





i
am
not
surprised
or
afflicted
at
the
misconceptions
of
my
neighbours
with
relation
to
my
own
character
men
must
judge
from
what
they
see
they
must
build
their
conclusions
on
their
knowledge
i
never
saw
in
the
rebukes
of
my
neighbours
any
thing
but
laudable
abhorrence
of
vice
they
were
too
eager
to
blame
to
collect
materials
of
censure
rather
than
of
praise
it
was
not
me
whom
they
hated
and
despised
it
was
the
phantom
that
passed
under
my
name
which
existed
only
in
their
imagination
and
which
was
worthy
of
all
their
scorn
and
all
their
enmity
what
i
appeared
to
be
in
their
eyes
was
as
much
the
object
of
my
own
disapprobation
as
of
theirs
their
reproaches
only
evinced
the
rectitude
of
their
decisions
as
well
as
of
my
own
i
drew
from
them
new
motives
to
complacency
they
fortified
my
perseverance
in
the
path
which
i
had
chosen
as
best
they
raised
me
higher
in
my
own
esteem
they
heightened
the
claims
of
the
reproachers
themselves
to
my
respect
and
my
gratitude
they
thought
me
slothful
incurious
destitute
of
knowledge
and
of
all
thirst
of
knowledge
insolent
and
profligate
they
say
that
in
the
treatment
of
my
father
i
have
been
ungrateful
and
inhuman
i
have
stolen
his
property
and
deserted
him
in
his
calamity
therefore
they
hate
and
revile
me
it
is
well
i
love
them
for
these
proofs
of
their
discernment
and
integrity
their
indignation
at
wrong
is
the
truest
test
of
their
virtue
it
is
true
that
they
mistake
me
but
that
arises
from
the
circumstances
of
our
mutual
situation
they
examined
what
was
exposed
to
their
view
they
grasped
at
what
was
placed
within
their
reach
to
decide
contrary
to
appearances
to
judge
from
what
they
knew
not
would
prove
them
to
be
brutish
and
not
rational
would
make
their
decision
of
no
worth
and
render
them
in
their
turn
objects
of
neglect
and
contempt
it
is
true
that
i
hated
school
that
i
sought
occasions
of
absence
and
finally
on
being
struck
by
the
master
determined
to
enter
his
presence
no
more
i
loved
to
leap
to
run
to
swim
to
climb
trees
and
to
clamber
up
rocks
to
shroud
myself
in
thickets
and
stroll
among
woods
to
obey
the
impulse
of
the
moment
and
to
prate
or
be
silent
just
as
my
humour
prompted
me
all
this
i
loved
more
than
to
go
to
and
fro
in
the
same
path
and
at
stated
hours
to
look
off
and
on
a
book
to
read
just
as
much
and
of
such
a
kind
to
stand
up
and
be
seated
just
as
another
thought
proper
to
direct
i
hated
to
be
classed
cribbed
rebuked
and
feruled
at
the
pleasure
of
one
who
as
it
seemed
to
me
knew
no
guide
in
his
rewards
but
caprice
and
no
prompter
in
his
punishments
but
passion
it
is
true
that
i
took
up
the
spade
and
the
hoe
as
rarely
and
for
as
short
a
time
as
possible
i
preferred
to
ramble
in
the
forest
and
loiter
on
the
hill
perpetually
to
change
the
scene
to
scrutinize
the
endless
variety
of
objects
to
compare
one
leaf
and
pebble
with
another
to
pursue
those
trains
of
thought
which
their
resemblances
and
differences
suggested
to
inquire
what
it
was
that
gave
them
this
place
structure
and
form
were
more
agreeable
employments
than
ploughing
and
threshing
my
father
could
well
afford
to
hire
labour
what
my
age
and
my
constitution
enabled
me
to
do
could
be
done
by
a
sturdy
boy
in
half
the
time
with
half
the
toil
and
with
none
of
the
reluctance
the
boy
was
a
bond-servant
and
the
cost
of
his
clothing
and
food
was
next
to
nothing
true
it
is
that
my
service
would
have
saved
him
even
this
expense
but
my
motives
for
declining
the
effort
were
not
hastily
weighed
or
superficially
examined
these
were
my
motives
my
frame
was
delicate
and
feeble
exposure
to
wet
blasts
and
vertical
suns
was
sure
to
make
me
sick
my
father
was
insensible
to
this
consequence
and
no
degree
of
diligence
would
please
him
but
that
which
would
destroy
my
health
my
health
was
dearer
to
my
mother
than
to
me
she
was
more
anxious
to
exempt
me
from
possible
injuries
than
reason
justified
but
anxious
she
was
and
i
could
not
save
her
from
anxiety
but
by
almost
wholly
abstaining
from
labour
i
thought
her
peace
of
mind
was
of
some
value
and
that
if
the
inclination
of
either
of
my
parents
must
be
gratified
at
the
expense
of
the
other
the
preference
was
due
to
the
woman
who
bore
me
who
nursed
me
in
disease
who
watched
over
my
safety
with
incessant
tenderness
whose
life
and
whose
peace
were
involved
in
mine
i
should
have
deemed
myself
brutish
and
obdurately
wicked
to
have
loaded
her
with
fears
and
cares
merely
to
smooth
the
brow
of
a
froward
old
man
whose
avarice
called
on
me
to
sacrifice
my
ease
and
my
health
and
who
shifted
to
other
shoulders
the
province
of
sustaining
me
when
sick
and
of
mourning
for
me
when
dead
i
likewise
believed
that
it
became
me
to
reflect
upon
the
influence
of
my
decision
on
my
own
happiness
and
to
weigh
the
profits
flowing
to
my
father
from
my
labour
against
the
benefits
of
mental
exercise
the
pleasures
of
the
woods
and
streams
healthful
sensations
and
the
luxury
of
musing
the
pecuniary
profit
was
petty
and
contemptible
it
obviated
no
necessity
it
purchased
no
rational
enjoyment
it
merely
provoked
by
furnishing
the
means
of
indulgence
an
appetite
from
which
my
father
was
not
exempt
it
cherished
the
seeds
of
depravity
in
him
and
lessened
the
little
stock
of
happiness
belonging
to
my
mother
i
did
not
detain
you
long
my
friends
in
portraying
my
parents
and
recounting
domestic
incidents
when
i
first
told
you
my
story
what
had
no
connection
with
the
history
of
welbeck
and
with
the
part
that
i
have
acted
upon
this
stage
i
thought
it
proper
to
omit
my
omission
was
likewise
prompted
by
other
reasons
my
mind
is
enervated
and
feeble
like
my
body
i
cannot
look
upon
the
sufferings
of
those
i
love
without
exquisite
pain
i
cannot
steel
my
heart
by
the
force
of
reason
and
by
submission
to
necessity
and
therefore
too
frequently
employ
the
cowardly
expedient
of
endeavouring
to
forget
what
i
cannot
remember
without
agony
i
told
you
that
my
father
was
sober
and
industrious
by
habit
but
habit
is
not
uniform
there
were
intervals
when
his
plodding
and
tame
spirit
gave
place
to
the
malice
and
fury
of
a
demon
liquors
were
not
sought
by
him
but
he
could
not
withstand
entreaty
and
a
potion
that
produced
no
effect
upon
others
changed
him
into
a
maniac
i
told
you
that
i
had
a
sister
whom
the
arts
of
a
villain
destroyed
alas
the
work
of
her
destruction
was
left
unfinished
by
him
the
blows
and
contumelies
of
a
misjudging
and
implacable
parent
who
scrupled
not
to
thrust
her
with
her
new-born
infant
out
of
doors
the
curses
and
taunts
of
unnatural
brothers
left
her
no
alternative
but
death----but
i
must
not
think
of
this
i
must
not
think
of
the
wrongs
which
my
mother
endured
in
the
person
of
her
only
and
darling
daughter
my
brothers
were
the
copyists
of
the
father
whom
they
resembled
in
temper
and
person
my
mother
doted
on
her
own
image
in
her
daughter
and
in
me
this
daughter
was
ravished
from
her
by
self-violence
and
her
other
children
by
disease
i
only
remained
to
appropriate
her
affections
and
fulfil
her
hopes
this
alone
had
furnished
a
sufficient
reason
why
i
should
be
careful
of
my
health
and
my
life
but
my
father's
character
supplied
me
with
a
motive
infinitely
more
cogent
it
is
almost
incredible
but
nevertheless
true
that
the
only
being
whose
presence
and
remonstrances
had
any
influence
on
my
father
at
moments
when
his
reason
was
extinct
was
myself
as
to
my
personal
strength
it
was
nothing
yet
my
mother's
person
was
rescued
from
brutal
violence
he
was
checked
in
the
midst
of
his
ferocious
career
by
a
single
look
or
exclamation
from
me
the
fear
of
my
rebukes
had
even
some
influence
in
enabling
him
to
resist
temptation
if
i
entered
the
tavern
at
the
moment
when
he
was
lifting
the
glass
to
his
lips
i
never
weighed
the
injunctions
of
decorum
but
snatching
the
vessel
from
his
hand
i
threw
it
on
the
ground
i
was
not
deterred
by
the
presence
of
others
and
their
censures
on
my
want
of
filial
respect
and
duty
were
listened
to
with
unconcern
i
chose
not
to
justify
myself
by
expatiating
on
domestic
miseries
and
by
calling
down
that
pity
on
my
mother
which
i
knew
would
only
have
increased
her
distress
the
world
regarded
my
deportment
as
insolent
and
perverse
to
a
degree
of
insanity
to
deny
my
father
an
indulgence
which
they
thought
harmless
and
which
indeed
was
harmless
in
its
influence
on
other
men
to
interfere
thus
publicly
with
his
social
enjoyments
and
expose
him
to
mortification
and
shame
was
loudly
condemned
but
my
duty
to
my
mother
debarred
me
from
eluding
this
censure
on
the
only
terms
on
which
it
could
have
been
eluded
now
it
has
ceased
to
be
necessary
to
conceal
what
passed
in
domestic
retirements
and
i
should
willingly
confess
the
truth
before
any
audience
at
first
my
father
imagined
that
threats
and
blows
would
intimidate
his
monitor
in
this
he
was
mistaken
and
the
detection
of
this
mistake
impressed
him
with
an
involuntary
reverence
for
me
which
set
bounds
to
those
excesses
which
disdained
any
other
control
hence
i
derived
new
motives
for
cherishing
a
life
which
was
useful
in
so
many
ways
to
my
mother
my
condition
is
now
changed
i
am
no
longer
on
that
field
to
which
the
law
as
well
as
reason
must
acknowledge
that
i
had
some
right
while
there
was
any
in
my
father
i
must
hazard
my
life
if
need
be
in
the
pursuit
of
the
means
of
honest
subsistence
i
never
spared
myself
while
in
the
service
of
mr
hadwin
and
at
a
more
inclement
season
should
probably
have
incurred
some
hazard
by
my
diligence
these
were
the
motives
of
my
idleness--for
my
abstaining
from
the
common
toils
of
the
farm
passed
by
that
name
among
my
neighbours
though
in
truth
my
time
was
far
from
being
wholly
unoccupied
by
manual
employments
but
these
required
less
exertion
of
body
or
mind
or
were
more
connected
with
intellectual
efforts
they
were
pursued
in
the
seclusion
of
my
chamber
or
the
recesses
of
a
wood
i
did
not
labour
to
conceal
them
but
neither
was
i
anxious
to
attract
notice
it
was
sufficient
that
the
censure
of
my
neighbours
was
unmerited
to
make
me
regard
it
with
indifference
i
sought
not
the
society
of
persons
of
my
own
age
not
from
sullen
or
unsociable
habits
but
merely
because
those
around
me
were
totally
unlike
myself
their
tastes
and
occupations
were
incompatible
with
mine
in
my
few
books
in
my
pen
in
the
vegetable
and
animal
existences
around
me
i
found
companions
who
adapted
their
visits
and
intercourse
to
my
convenience
and
caprice
and
with
whom
i
was
never
tired
of
communing
i
was
not
unaware
of
the
opinion
which
my
neighbours
had
formed
of
my
being
improperly
connected
with
betty
lawrence
i
am
not
sorry
that
i
fell
into
company
with
that
girl
her
intercourse
has
instructed
me
in
what
some
would
think
impossible
to
be
attained
by
one
who
had
never
haunted
the
impure
recesses
of
licentiousness
in
a
city
the
knowledge
which
a
residence
in
this
town
for
ten
years
gave
her
audacious
and
inquisitive
spirit
she
imparted
to
me
her
character
profligate
and
artful
libidinous
and
impudent
and
made
up
of
the
impressions
which
a
city
life
had
produced
on
her
coarse
but
active
mind
was
open
to
my
study
and
i
studied
it
i
scarcely
know
how
to
repel
the
charge
of
illicit
conduct
and
to
depict
the
exact
species
of
intercourse
subsisting
between
us
i
always
treated
her
with
freedom
and
sometimes
with
gayety
i
had
no
motives
to
reserve
i
was
so
formed
that
a
creature
like
her
had
no
power
over
my
senses
that
species
of
temptation
adapted
to
entice
me
from
the
true
path
was
widely
different
from
the
artifices
of
betty
there
was
no
point
at
which
it
was
possible
for
her
to
get
possession
of
my
fancy
i
watched
her
while
she
practised
all
her
tricks
and
blandishments
as
i
regarded
a
similar
deportment
in
the
animal
salax
ignavumque
who
inhabits
the
sty
i
made
efforts
to
pursue
my
observations
unembarrassed
but
my
efforts
were
made
not
to
restrain
desire
but
to
suppress
disgust
the
difficulty
lay
not
in
withholding
my
caresses
but
in
forbearing
to
repulse
her
with
rage
decorum
indeed
was
not
outraged
and
all
limits
were
not
overstepped
at
once
dubious
advances
were
employed
but
when
found
unavailing
were
displaced
by
more
shameless
and
direct
proceedings
she
was
too
little
versed
in
human
nature
to
see
that
her
last
expedient
was
always
worse
than
the
preceding
and
that
in
proportion
as
she
lost
sight
of
decency
she
multiplied
the
obstacles
to
her
success
betty
had
many
enticements
in
person
and
air
she
was
ruddy
smooth
and
plump
to
these
she
added--i
must
not
say
what
for
it
is
strange
to
what
lengths
a
woman
destitute
of
modesty
will
sometimes
go
but
all
her
artifices
availing
her
not
at
all
in
the
contest
with
my
insensibilities
she
resorted
to
extremes
which
it
would
serve
no
good
purpose
to
describe
in
this
audience
they
produced
not
the
consequences
she
wished
but
they
produced
another
which
was
by
no
means
displeasing
to
her
an
incident
one
night
occurred
from
which
a
sagacious
observer
deduced
the
existence
of
an
intrigue
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
rectify
his
mistake
by
explaining
appearances
in
a
manner
consistent
with
my
innocence
this
mode
of
explication
implied
a
continence
in
me
which
he
denied
to
be
possible
the
standard
of
possibilities
especially
in
vice
and
virtue
is
fashioned
by
most
men
after
their
own
character
a
temptation
which
this
judge
of
human
nature
knew
that
he
was
unable
to
resist
he
sagely
concluded
to
be
irresistible
by
any
other
man
and
quickly
established
the
belief
among
my
neighbours
that
the
woman
who
married
the
father
had
been
prostituted
to
the
son
though
i
never
admitted
the
truth
of
this
aspersion
i
believed
it
useless
to
deny
because
no
one
would
credit
my
denial
and
because
i
had
no
power
to
disprove
it
what
other
inquiries
were
to
be
resolved
by
our
young
friend
we
were
now
at
this
late
hour
obliged
to
postpone
till
the
morrow
i
shall
pass
over
the
reflections
which
a
story
like
this
would
naturally
suggest
and
hasten
to
our
next
interview
after
breakfast
next
morning
the
subject
of
last
night's
conversation
was
renewed
i
told
him
that
something
had
occurred
in
his
absence
in
relation
to
mrs
wentworth
and
her
nephew
that
had
perplexed
us
not
a
little
my
information
is
obtained
continued
i
from
wortley
and
it
is
nothing
less
than
that
young
clavering
mrs
wentworth's
nephew
is
at
this
time
actually
alive
surprise
but
none
of
the
embarrassment
of
guilt
appeared
in
his
countenance
at
these
tidings
he
looked
at
me
as
if
desirous
that
i
should
proceed
it
seems
added
i
that
a
letter
was
lately
received
by
this
lady
from
the
father
of
clavering
who
is
now
in
europe
this
letter
reports
that
this
son
was
lately
met
with
in
charleston
and
relates
the
means
which
old
mr
clavering
had
used
to
prevail
upon
his
son
to
return
home
means
of
the
success
of
which
he
entertained
well-grounded
hopes
what
think
you
i
can
only
reject
it
said
he
after
some
pause
as
untrue
the
father's
correspondent
may
have
been
deceived
the
father
may
have
been
deceived
or
the
father
may
conceive
it
necessary
to
deceive
the
aunt
or
some
other
supposition
as
to
the
source
of
the
error
may
be
true
but
an
error
it
surely
is
clavering
is
not
alive
i
know
the
chamber
where
he
died
and
the
withered
pine
under
which
he
lies
buried
if
she
be
deceived
said
i
it
will
be
impossible
to
rectify
her
error
i
hope
not
an
honest
front
and
a
straight
story
will
be
sufficient
how
do
you
mean
to
act
visit
her
without
doubt
and
tell
her
the
truth
my
tale
will
be
too
circumstantial
and
consistent
to
permit
her
to
disbelieve
she
will
not
hearken
to
you
she
is
too
strongly
prepossessed
against
you
to
admit
you
even
to
a
hearing
she
cannot
help
it
unless
she
lock
her
door
against
me
or
stuff
her
ears
with
wool
she
must
hear
me
her
prepossessions
are
reasonable
but
are
easily
removed
by
telling
the
truth
why
does
she
suspect
me
of
artifice
because
i
seemed
to
be
allied
to
welbeck
and
because
i
disguised
the
truth
that
she
thinks
ill
of
me
is
not
her
fault
but
my
misfortune
and
happily
for
me
a
misfortune
easily
removed
then
you
will
try
to
see
her
i
will
see
her
and
the
sooner
the
better
i
will
see
her
to-day
this
morning
as
soon
as
i
have
seen
welbeck
whom
i
shall
immediately
visit
in
his
prison
there
are
other
embarrassments
and
dangers
of
which
you
are
not
aware
welbeck
is
pursued
by
many
persons
whom
he
has
defrauded
of
large
sums
by
these
persons
you
are
deemed
an
accomplice
in
his
guilt
and
a
warrant
is
already
in
the
hands
of
officers
for
arresting
you
wherever
you
are
found
in
what
way
said
mervyn
sedately
do
they
imagine
me
a
partaker
of
his
crime
i
know
not
you
lived
with
him
you
fled
with
him
you
aided
and
connived
at
his
escape
are
these
crimes
i
believe
not
but
they
subject
you
to
suspicion
to
arrest
and
to
punishment
to
detention
for
a
while
perhaps
but
these
alone
cannot
expose
you
to
punishment
i
thought
so
then
i
have
nothing
to
fear
you
have
imprisonment
and
obloquy
at
least
to
dread
true
but
they
cannot
be
avoided
but
by
my
exile
and
skulking
out
of
sight--evils
infinitely
more
formidable
i
shall
therefore
not
avoid
them
the
sooner
my
conduct
is
subjected
to
scrutiny
the
better
will
you
go
with
me
to
welbeck
i
will
go
with
you
inquiring
for
welbeck
of
the
keeper
of
the
prison
we
were
informed
that
he
was
in
his
own
apartment
very
sick
the
physician
attending
the
prison
had
been
called
but
the
prisoner
had
preserved
an
obstinate
and
scornful
silence
and
had
neither
explained
his
condition
nor
consented
to
accept
any
aid
we
now
went
alone
into
his
apartment
his
sensibility
seemed
fast
ebbing
yet
an
emotion
of
joy
was
visible
in
his
eyes
at
the
appearance
of
mervyn
he
seemed
likewise
to
recognise
in
me
his
late
visitant
and
made
no
objection
to
my
entrance
how
are
you
this
morning
said
arthur
seating
himself
on
the
bedside
and
taking
his
hand
the
sick
man
was
scarcely
able
to
articulate
his
reply--i
shall
soon
be
well
i
have
longed
to
see
you
i
want
to
leave
with
you
a
few
words
he
now
cast
his
languid
eyes
on
me
you
are
his
friend
he
continued
you
know
all
you
may
stay
there
now
succeeded
a
long
pause
during
which
he
closed
his
eyes
and
resigned
himself
as
if
to
an
oblivion
of
all
thought
his
pulse
under
my
hand
was
scarcely
perceptible
from
this
in
some
minutes
he
recovered
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
mervyn
resumed
in
a
broken
and
feeble
accent--
clemenza
you
have
seen
her
weeks
ago
i
left
her
in
an
accursed
house
yet
she
has
not
been
mistreated
neglected
and
abandoned
indeed
but
not
mistreated
save
her
mervyn
comfort
her
awaken
charity
for
her
sake
i
cannot
tell
you
what
has
happened
the
tale
would
be
too
long--too
mournful
yet
in
justice
to
the
living
i
must
tell
you
something
my
woes
and
my
crimes
will
be
buried
with
me
some
of
them
but
not
all
ere
this
i
should
have
been
many
leagues
upon
the
ocean
had
not
a
newspaper
fallen
into
my
hands
while
on
the
eve
of
embarkation
by
that
i
learned
that
a
treasure
was
buried
with
the
remains
of
the
ill-fated
watson
i
was
destitute
i
was
unjust
enough
to
wish
to
make
this
treasure
my
own
prone
to
think
i
was
forgotten
or
numbered
with
the
victims
of
pestilence
i
ventured
to
return
under
a
careless
disguise
i
penetrated
to
the
vaults
of
that
deserted
dwelling
by
night
i
dug
up
the
bones
of
my
friend
and
found
the
girdle
and
its
valuable
contents
according
to
the
accurate
description
that
i
had
read
i
hastened
back
with
my
prize
to
baltimore
but
my
evil
destiny
overtook
me
at
last
i
was
recognised
by
emissaries
of
jamieson
arrested
and
brought
hither
and
here
shall
i
consummate
my
fate
and
defeat
the
rage
of
my
creditors
by
death
but
first----
here
welbeck
stretched
out
his
left
hand
to
mervyn
and
after
some
reluctance
showed
a
roll
of
lead
receive
this
said
he
in
the
use
of
it
be
guided
by
your
honesty
and
by
the
same
advertisement
that
furnished
me
the
clue
by
which
to
recover
it
that
being
secured
the
world
and
i
will
part
forever
withdraw
for
your
presence
can
help
me
nothing
we
were
unwilling
to
comply
with
his
injunction
and
continued
some
longer
time
in
his
chamber
but
our
kind
intent
availed
nothing
he
quickly
relapsed
into
insensibility
from
which
he
recovered
not
again
but
next
day
expired
such
in
the
flower
of
his
age
was
the
fate
of
thomas
welbeck
whatever
interest
i
might
feel
in
accompanying
the
progress
of
my
young
friend
a
sudden
and
unforeseen
emergency
compelled
me
again
to
leave
the
city
a
kinsman
to
whom
i
was
bound
by
many
obligations
was
suffering
a
lingering
disease
and
imagining
with
some
reason
his
dissolution
to
be
not
far
distant
he
besought
my
company
and
my
assistance
to
soothe
at
least
the
agonies
of
his
last
hour
i
was
anxious
to
clear
up
the
mysteries
which
arthur's
conduct
had
produced
and
to
shield
him
if
possible
from
the
evils
which
i
feared
awaited
him
it
was
impossible
however
to
decline
the
invitation
of
my
kinsman
as
his
residence
was
not
a
day's
journey
from
the
city
i
was
obliged
to
content
myself
with
occasional
information
imparted
by
mervyn's
letters
or
those
of
my
wife
meanwhile
on
leaving
the
prison
i
hasted
to
inform
mervyn
of
the
true
nature
of
the
scene
which
had
just
passed
by
this
extraordinary
occurrence
the
property
of
the
maurices
was
now
in
honest
hands
welbeck
stimulated
by
selfish
motives
had
done
that
which
any
other
person
would
have
found
encompassed
with
formidable
dangers
and
difficulties
how
this
attempt
was
suggested
or
executed
he
had
not
informed
us
nor
was
it
desirable
to
know
it
was
sufficient
that
the
means
of
restoring
their
own
to
a
destitute
and
meritorious
family
were
now
in
our
possession
having
returned
home
i
unfolded
to
mervyn
all
the
particulars
respecting
williams
and
the
maurices
which
i
had
lately
learned
from
wortley
he
listened
with
deep
attention
and
my
story
being
finished
he
said
in
this
small
compass
then
is
the
patrimony
and
subsistence
of
a
numerous
family
to
restore
it
to
them
is
the
obvious
proceeding--but
how
where
do
they
abide
williams
and
watson's
wife
live
in
baltimore
and
the
maurices
live
near
that
town
the
advertisements
alluded
to
by
wortley
and
which
are
to
be
found
in
any
newspaper
will
inform
us
but
first
are
we
sure
that
any
or
all
of
these
bills
are
contained
in
this
covering
the
lead
was
now
unrolled
and
the
bills
which
williams
had
described
were
found
enclosed
nothing
appeared
to
be
deficient
of
this
however
we
were
scarcely
qualified
to
judge
those
that
were
the
property
of
williams
might
not
be
entire
and
what
would
be
the
consequence
of
presenting
them
to
him
if
any
had
been
embezzled
by
welbeck
this
difficulty
was
obviated
by
mervyn
who
observed
that
the
advertisement
describing
these
bills
would
afford
us
ample
information
on
this
head
having
found
out
where
the
maurices
and
mrs
watson
live
nothing
remains
but
to
visit
them
and
put
an
end
as
far
as
lies
in
my
power
to
their
inquietudes
what
would
you
go
to
baltimore
certainly
can
any
other
expedient
be
proper
how
shall
i
otherwise
insure
the
safe
conveyance
of
these
papers
you
may
send
them
by
post
but
why
not
go
myself
i
can
hardly
tell
unless
your
appearance
on
such
an
errand
may
be
suspected
likely
to
involve
you
in
embarrassments
what
embarrassments
if
they
receive
their
own
ought
they
not
to
be
satisfied
the
inquiry
will
naturally
be
made
as
to
the
manner
of
gaining
possession
of
these
papers
they
were
lately
in
the
hands
of
watson
but
watson
has
disappeared
suspicions
are
awake
respecting
the
cause
of
his
disappearance
these
suspicions
are
connected
with
welbeck
and
welbeck's
connection
with
you
is
not
unknown
these
are
evils
but
i
see
not
how
an
ingenious
and
open
conduct
is
adapted
to
increase
these
evils
if
they
come
i
must
endure
them
i
believe
your
decision
is
right
no
one
is
so
skilful
an
advocate
in
a
cause
as
he
whose
cause
it
is
i
rely
upon
your
skill
and
address
and
shall
leave
you
to
pursue
your
own
way
i
must
leave
you
for
a
time
but
shall
expect
to
be
punctually
informed
of
all
that
passes
with
this
agreement
we
parted
and
i
hastened
to
perform
my
intended
journey
i
am
glad
my
friend
thy
nimble
pen
has
got
so
far
upon
its
journey
what
remains
of
my
story
may
be
despatched
in
a
trice
i
have
just
now
some
vacant
hours
which
might
possibly
be
more
usefully
employed
but
not
in
an
easier
manner
or
more
pleasant
so
let
me
carry
on
thy
thread
first
let
me
mention
the
resolutions
i
had
formed
at
the
time
i
parted
with
my
friend
i
had
several
objects
in
view
one
was
a
conference
with
mrs
wentworth
another
was
an
interview
with
her
whom
i
met
with
at
villars's
my
heart
melted
when
i
thought
upon
the
desolate
condition
of
clemenza
and
determined
me
to
direct
my
first
efforts
for
her
relief
for
this
end
i
was
to
visit
the
female
who
had
given
me
a
direction
to
her
house
the
name
of
this
person
is
achsa
fielding
and
she
lived
according
to
her
own
direction
at
no
40
walnut
street
i
went
thither
without
delay
she
was
not
at
home
having
gained
information
from
the
servant
as
to
when
she
might
be
found
i
proceeded
to
mrs
wentworth's
in
going
thither
my
mind
was
deeply
occupied
in
meditation
and
with
my
usual
carelessness
of
forms
i
entered
the
house
and
made
my
way
to
the
parlour
where
an
interview
had
formerly
taken
place
between
us
having
arrived
i
began
though
somewhat
unseasonably
to
reflect
upon
the
topics
with
which
i
should
introduce
my
conversation
and
particularly
the
manner
in
which
i
should
introduce
myself
i
had
opened
doors
without
warning
and
traversed
passages
without
being
noticed
this
had
arisen
from
my
thoughtlessness
there
was
no
one
within
hearing
or
sight
what
was
next
to
be
done
should
i
not
return
softly
to
the
outer
door
and
summon
the
servant
by
knocking
preparing
to
do
this
i
heard
a
footstep
in
the
entry
which
suspended
my
design
i
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
attentive
to
these
movements
when
presently
the
door
opened
and
there
entered
the
apartment
mrs
wentworth
herself
she
came
as
it
seemed
without
expectation
of
finding
any
one
there
when
therefore
the
figure
of
a
man
caught
her
vagrant
attention
she
started
and
cast
a
hasty
look
towards
me
pray
in
a
peremptory
tone
how
came
you
here
sir
and
what
is
your
business
neither
arrogance
on
the
one
hand
nor
humility
upon
the
other
had
any
part
in
modelling
my
deportment
i
came
not
to
deprecate
anger
or
exult
over
distress
i
answered
therefore
distinctly
firmly
and
erectly--
i
came
to
see
you
madam
and
converse
with
you
but
being
busy
with
other
thoughts
i
forgot
to
knock
at
the
door
no
evil
was
intended
by
my
negligence
though
propriety
has
certainly
not
been
observed
will
you
pardon
this
intrusion
and
condescend
to
grant
me
your
attention
to
what
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
i
know
you
only
as
the
accomplice
of
a
villain
in
an
attempt
to
deceive
me
there
is
nothing
to
justify
your
coming
hither
and
i
desire
you
to
leave
the
house
with
as
little
ceremony
as
you
entered
it
my
eyes
were
lowered
at
this
rebuke
yet
i
did
not
obey
the
command
your
treatment
of
me
madam
is
such
as
i
appear
to
you
to
deserve
appearances
are
unfavourable
to
me
but
those
appearances
are
false
i
have
concurred
in
no
plot
against
your
reputation
or
your
fortune
i
have
told
you
nothing
but
the
truth
i
came
hither
to
promote
no
selfish
or
sinister
purpose
i
have
no
favour
to
entreat
and
no
petition
to
offer
but
that
you
will
suffer
me
to
clear
up
those
mistakes
which
you
have
harboured
respecting
me
i
am
poor
i
am
destitute
of
fame
and
of
kindred
i
have
nothing
to
console
me
in
obscurity
and
indigence
but
the
approbation
of
my
own
heart
and
the
good
opinion
of
those
who
know
me
as
i
am
the
good
may
be
led
to
despise
and
condemn
me
their
aversion
and
scorn
shall
not
make
me
unhappy
but
it
is
my
interest
and
my
duty
to
rectify
their
error
if
i
can
i
regard
your
character
with
esteem
you
have
been
mistaken
in
condemning
me
as
a
liar
and
impostor
and
i
came
to
remove
this
mistake
i
came
if
not
to
procure
your
esteem
at
least
to
take
away
hatred
and
suspicion
but
this
is
not
all
my
purpose
you
are
in
an
error
in
relation
not
only
to
my
character
but
to
the
situation
of
your
nephew
clavering
i
formerly
told
you
that
i
saw
him
die
that
i
assisted
at
his
burial
but
my
tale
was
incoherent
and
imperfect
and
you
have
since
received
intelligence
to
which
you
think
proper
to
trust
and
which
assures
you
that
he
is
still
living
all
i
now
ask
is
your
attention
while
i
relate
the
particulars
of
my
knowledge
proof
of
my
veracity
or
innocence
may
be
of
no
value
in
your
eyes
but
the
fate
of
your
nephew
ought
to
be
known
to
you
certainty
on
this
head
may
be
of
much
importance
to
your
happiness
and
to
the
regulation
of
your
future
conduct
to
hear
me
patiently
can
do
you
no
injury
and
may
benefit
you
much
will
you
permit
me
to
go
on
during
this
address
little
abatement
of
resentment
and
scorn
was
visible
in
my
companion
i
will
hear
you
she
replied
your
invention
may
amuse
if
it
does
not
edify
but
i
pray
you
let
your
story
be
short
i
was
obliged
to
be
content
with
this
ungraceful
concession
and
proceeded
to
begin
my
narration
i
described
the
situation
of
my
father's
dwelling
i
mentioned
the
year
month
day
and
hour
of
her
nephew's
appearance
among
us
i
expatiated
minutely
on
his
form
features
dress
sound
of
his
voice
and
repeated
his
words
his
favourite
gestures
and
attitudes
were
faithfully
described
i
had
gone
but
a
little
way
in
my
story
when
the
effects
were
visible
in
her
demeanour
which
i
expected
from
it
her
knowledge
of
the
youth
and
of
the
time
and
manner
of
his
disappearance
made
it
impossible
for
me
with
so
minute
a
narrative
to
impose
upon
her
credulity
every
word
every
incident
related
attested
my
truth
by
their
agreement
with
what
she
herself
previously
knew
her
suspicious
and
angry
watchfulness
was
quickly
exchanged
for
downcast
looks
and
stealing
tears
and
sighs
difficultly
repressed
meanwhile
i
did
not
pause
but
described
the
treatment
he
received
from
my
mother's
tenderness
his
occupations
the
freaks
of
his
insanity
and
finally
the
circumstances
of
his
death
and
funeral
thence
i
hastened
to
the
circumstances
which
brought
me
to
the
city
which
placed
me
in
the
service
of
welbeck
and
obliged
me
to
perform
so
ambiguous
a
part
in
her
presence
i
left
no
difficulty
to
be
solved
and
no
question
unanticipated
i
have
now
finished
my
story
i
continued
and
accomplished
my
design
in
coming
hither
whether
i
have
vindicated
my
integrity
from
your
suspicions
i
know
not
i
have
done
what
in
me
lay
to
remove
your
error
and
in
that
have
done
my
duty
what
more
remains
any
inquiries
you
are
pleased
to
make
i
am
ready
to
answer
if
there
be
none
to
make
i
will
comply
with
your
former
commands
and
leave
the
house
with
as
little
ceremony
as
i
entered
it
your
story
she
replied
has
been
unexpected
i
believe
it
fully
and
am
sorry
for
the
hard
thoughts
which
past
appearances
have
made
me
entertain
concerning
you
here
she
sunk
into
mournful
silence
the
information
she
at
length
resumed
which
i
have
received
from
another
quarter
respecting
that
unfortunate
youth
astonishes
and
perplexes
me
it
is
inconsistent
with
your
story
but
it
must
be
founded
on
some
mistake
which
i
am
at
present
unable
to
unravel
welbeck
whose
connection
has
been
so
unfortunate
to
you----
unfortunate
dear
madam
how
unfortunate
it
has
done
away
a
part
of
my
ignorance
of
the
world
in
which
i
live
it
has
led
me
to
the
situation
in
which
i
am
now
placed
it
has
introduced
me
to
the
knowledge
of
many
good
people
it
has
made
me
the
witness
and
the
subject
of
many
acts
of
beneficence
and
generosity
my
knowledge
of
welbeck
has
been
useful
to
me
it
has
enabled
me
to
be
useful
to
others
i
look
back
upon
that
allotment
of
my
destiny
which
first
led
me
to
his
door
with
gratitude
and
pleasure
would
to
heaven
continued
i
somewhat
changing
my
tone
intercourse
with
welbeck
had
been
as
harmless
to
all
others
as
it
has
been
to
me
that
no
injury
to
fortune
and
fame
and
innocence
and
life
had
been
incurred
by
others
greater
than
has
fallen
upon
my
head
there
is
one
being
whose
connection
with
him
has
not
been
utterly
dissimilar
in
its
origin
and
circumstances
to
mine
though
the
catastrophe
has
indeed
been
widely
and
mournfully
different
and
yet
within
this
moment
a
thought
has
occurred
from
which
i
derive
some
consolation
and
some
hope
you
dear
madam
are
rich
these
spacious
apartments
this
plentiful
accommodation
are
yours
you
have
enough
for
your
own
gratification
and
convenience
and
somewhat
to
spare
will
you
take
to
your
protecting
arms
to
your
hospitable
roof
an
unhappy
girl
whom
the
arts
of
welbeck
have
robbed
of
fortune
reputation
and
honour
who
is
now
languishing
in
poverty
weeping
over
the
lifeless
remains
of
her
babe
surrounded
by
the
agents
of
vice
and
trembling
on
the
verge
of
infamy
what
can
this
mean
replied
the
lady
of
whom
do
you
speak
you
shall
know
her
you
shall
be
apprized
of
her
claims
to
your
compassion
her
story
as
far
as
is
known
to
me
i
will
faithfully
repeat
to
you
she
is
a
stranger
an
italian
her
name
is
clemenza
lodi
clemenza
lodi
good
heaven
exclaimed
mrs
wentworth
why
surely--it
cannot
be
and
yet--is
it
possible
that
you
are
that
person
i
do
not
comprehend
you
madam
a
friend
has
related
a
transaction
of
a
strange
sort
it
is
scarcely
an
hour
since
she
told
it
me
the
name
of
clemenza
lodi
was
mentioned
in
it
and
a
young
man
of
most
singular
deportment
was
described
but
tell
me
how
you
were
engaged
on
thursday
morning
i
was
coming
to
this
city
from
a
distance
i
stopped
ten
minutes
at
the
house
of----
mrs
villars
the
same
perhaps
you
know
her
and
her
character
perhaps
you
can
confirm
or
rectify
my
present
opinions
concerning
her
it
is
there
that
the
unfortunate
clemenza
abides
it
is
thence
that
i
wish
her
to
be
speedily
removed
i
have
heard
of
you
of
your
conduct
upon
that
occasion
of
me
answered
i
eagerly
do
you
know
that
woman
so
saying
i
produced
the
card
which
i
had
received
from
her
and
on
which
her
name
was
written
i
know
her
well
she
is
my
countrywoman
and
my
friend
your
friend
then
she
is
good
she
is
innocent
she
is
generous
will
she
be
a
sister
a
protectress
to
clemenza
will
you
exhort
her
to
a
deed
of
charity
will
you
be
yourself
an
example
of
beneficence
direct
me
to
miss
fielding
i
beseech
you
i
have
called
on
her
already
but
in
vain
and
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
why
are
you
so
precipitate
what
would
you
do
take
her
away
from
that
house
instantly--bring
her
hither--place
her
under
your
protection--give
her
mrs
wentworth
for
a
counsellor--a
friend--a
mother
shall
i
do
this
shall
i
hie
thither
to-day
this
very
hour--now
give
me
your
consent
and
she
shall
be
with
you
before
noon
by
no
means
replied
she
with
earnestness
you
are
too
hasty
an
affair
of
so
much
importance
cannot
be
despatched
in
a
moment
there
are
many
difficulties
and
doubts
to
be
first
removed
let
them
be
reserved
for
the
future
withhold
not
your
helping
hand
till
the
struggle
has
disappeared
forever
think
on
the
gulf
that
is
already
gaping
to
swallow
her
this
is
no
time
to
hesitate
and
falter
i
will
tell
you
her
story
but
not
now
we
will
postpone
it
till
to-morrow
and
first
secure
her
from
impending
evils
she
shall
tell
it
you
herself
in
an
hour
i
will
bring
her
hither
and
she
herself
shall
recount
to
you
her
sorrows
will
you
let
me
your
behaviour
is
extraordinary
i
can
scarcely
tell
whether
this
simplicity
be
real
or
affected
one
would
think
that
your
common
sense
would
show
you
the
impropriety
of
your
request
to
admit
under
my
roof
a
woman
notoriously
dishonoured
and
from
an
infamous
house----
my
dearest
madam
how
can
you
reflect
upon
the
situation
without
irresistible
pity
i
see
that
you
are
thoroughly
aware
of
her
past
calamity
and
her
present
danger
do
not
these
urge
you
to
make
haste
to
her
relief
can
any
lot
be
more
deplorable
than
hers
can
any
state
be
more
perilous
poverty
is
not
the
only
evil
that
oppresses
or
that
threatens
her
the
scorn
of
the
world
and
her
own
compunction
the
death
of
the
fruit
of
her
error
and
the
witness
of
her
shame
are
not
the
worst
she
is
exposed
to
the
temptations
of
the
profligate
while
she
remains
with
mrs
villars
her
infamy
accumulates
her
further
debasement
is
facilitated
her
return
to
reputation
and
to
virtue
is
obstructed
by
new
bars
how
know
i
that
her
debasement
is
not
already
complete
and
irremediable
she
is
a
mother
but
not
a
wife
how
came
she
thus
is
her
being
welbeck's
prostitute
no
proof
of
her
guilt
alas
i
know
not
i
believe
her
not
very
culpable
i
know
her
to
be
unfortunate
to
have
been
robbed
and
betrayed
you
are
a
stranger
to
her
history
i
am
myself
imperfectly
acquainted
with
it
but
let
me
tell
you
the
little
that
i
know
perhaps
my
narrative
may
cause
you
to
think
of
her
as
i
do
she
did
not
object
to
this
proposal
and
i
immediately
recounted
all
that
i
had
gained
from
my
own
observations
or
from
welbeck
himself
respecting
this
forlorn
girl
having
finished
my
narrative
i
proceeded
thus--
can
you
hesitate
to
employ
that
power
which
was
given
you
for
good
ends
to
rescue
this
sufferer
take
her
to
your
home
to
your
bosom
to
your
confidence
keep
aloof
those
temptations
which
beset
her
in
her
present
situation
restore
her
to
that
purity
which
her
desolate
condition
her
ignorance
her
misplaced
gratitude
and
the
artifices
of
a
skilful
dissembler
have
destroyed
if
it
be
destroyed
for
how
know
we
under
what
circumstances
her
ruin
was
accomplished
with
what
pretences
or
appearances
or
promises
she
was
won
to
compliance
true
i
confess
my
ignorance
but
ought
not
that
ignorance
to
be
removed
before
she
makes
a
part
of
my
family
oh
no
it
may
be
afterwards
removed
it
cannot
be
removed
before
by
bringing
her
hither
you
shield
her
at
least
from
future
and
possible
evils
here
you
can
watch
her
conduct
and
sift
her
sentiments
conveniently
and
at
leisure
should
she
prove
worthy
of
your
charity
how
justly
may
you
congratulate
yourself
on
your
seasonable
efforts
in
her
cause
if
she
prove
unworthy
you
may
then
demean
yourself
according
to
her
demerits
i
must
reflect
upon
it--to-morrow----
let
me
prevail
on
you
to
admit
her
at
once
and
without
delay
this
very
moment
may
be
the
critical
one
to-day
we
may
exert
ourselves
with
success
but
to-morrow
all
our
efforts
may
be
fruitless
why
fluctuate
why
linger
when
so
much
good
may
be
done
and
no
evil
can
possibly
be
incurred
it
requires
but
a
word
from
you
you
need
not
move
a
finger
your
house
is
large
you
have
chambers
vacant
and
convenient
consent
only
that
your
door
shall
not
be
barred
against
her
that
you
will
treat
her
with
civility
to
carry
your
kindness
into
effect
to
persuade
her
to
attend
me
hither
and
to
place
herself
in
your
care
shall
be
my
province
these
and
many
similar
entreaties
and
reasonings
were
ineffectual
her
general
disposition
was
kind
but
she
was
unaccustomed
to
strenuous
or
sudden
exertions
to
admit
the
persuasions
of
such
an
advocate
to
so
uncommon
a
scheme
as
that
of
sharing
her
house
with
a
creature
thus
previously
unknown
to
her
thus
loaded
with
suspicion
and
with
obloquy
was
not
possible
i
at
last
forbore
importunity
and
requested
her
to
tell
me
when
i
might
expect
to
meet
with
mrs
fielding
at
her
lodgings
inquiry
was
made
to
what
end
i
sought
an
interview
i
made
no
secret
of
my
purpose
are
you
mad
young
man
she
exclaimed
mrs
fielding
has
already
been
egregiously
imprudent
on
the
faith
of
an
ancient
slight
acquaintance
with
mrs
villars
in
europe
she
suffered
herself
to
be
decoyed
into
a
visit
instead
of
taking
warning
by
numerous
tokens
of
the
real
character
of
that
woman
in
her
behaviour
and
in
that
of
her
visitants
she
consented
to
remain
there
one
night
the
next
morning
took
place
that
astonishing
interview
with
you
which
she
has
since
described
to
me
she
is
now
warned
against
the
like
indiscretion
and
pray
what
benevolent
scheme
would
you
propose
to
her
has
she
property
is
she
rich
she
is
unhappily
perhaps
for
her
she
is
absolute
mistress
of
her
fortune
and
has
neither
guardian
nor
parent
to
control
her
in
the
use
of
it
has
she
virtue
does
she
know
the
value
of
affluence
and
a
fair
fame
and
will
not
she
devote
a
few
dollars
to
rescue
a
fellow-creature
from
indigence
and
infamy
and
vice
surely
she
will
she
will
hazard
nothing
by
the
boon
i
will
be
her
almoner
i
will
provide
the
wretched
stranger
with
food
and
raiment
and
dwelling
i
will
pay
for
all
if
mrs
fielding
from
her
superfluity
will
supply
the
means
clemenza
shall
owe
life
and
honour
to
your
friend
till
i
am
able
to
supply
the
needful
sum
from
my
own
stock
while
thus
speaking
my
companion
gazed
at
me
with
steadfastness--i
know
not
what
to
make
of
you
your
language
and
ideas
are
those
of
a
lunatic
are
you
acquainted
with
mrs
fielding
yes
i
have
seen
her
two
days
ago
and
she
has
invited
me
to
see
her
again
and
on
the
strength
of
this
acquaintance
you
expect
to
be
her
almoner
to
be
the
medium
of
her
charity
i
desire
to
save
her
trouble
to
make
charity
as
light
and
easy
as
possible
'twill
be
better
if
she
perform
those
offices
herself
'twill
redound
more
to
the
credit
of
her
reason
and
her
virtue
but
i
solicit
her
benignity
only
in
the
cause
of
clemenza
for
her
only
do
i
wish
at
present
to
call
forth
her
generosity
and
pity
and
do
you
imagine
she
will
intrust
her
money
to
one
of
your
age
and
sex
whom
she
knows
so
imperfectly
to
administer
to
the
wants
of
one
whom
she
found
in
such
a
house
as
mrs
villars's
she
never
will
she
mentioned
her
imprudent
engagement
to
meet
you
but
she
is
now
warned
against
the
folly
of
such
confidence
you
have
told
me
plausible
stories
of
yourself
and
of
this
clemenza
i
cannot
say
that
i
disbelieve
them
but
i
know
the
ways
of
the
world
too
well
to
bestow
implicit
faith
so
easily
you
are
an
extraordinary
young
man
you
may
possibly
be
honest
such
a
one
as
you
with
your
education
and
address
may
possibly
have
passed
all
your
life
in
a
hovel
but
it
is
scarcely
credible
let
me
tell
you
i
believe
most
of
the
facts
respecting
my
nephew
because
my
knowledge
of
him
before
his
flight
would
enable
me
to
detect
your
falsehood
but
there
must
be
other
proofs
besides
an
innocent
brow
and
a
voluble
tongue
to
make
me
give
full
credit
to
your
pretensions
i
have
no
claim
upon
welbeck
which
can
embarrass
you
on
that
score
you
are
free
from
any
molestation
from
me
or
my
friends
i
have
suspected
you
of
being
an
accomplice
in
some
vile
plot
and
am
now
inclined
to
acquit
you
but
that
is
all
that
you
must
expect
from
me
till
your
character
be
established
by
other
means
than
your
own
assertions
i
am
engaged
at
present
and
must
therefore
request
you
to
put
an
end
to
your
visit
this
strain
was
much
unlike
the
strain
which
preceded
it
i
imagined
by
the
mildness
of
her
tone
and
manners
that
her
unfavourable
prepossessions
were
removed
but
they
seemed
to
have
suddenly
regained
their
pristine
force
i
was
somewhat
disconcerted
by
this
unexpected
change
i
stood
for
a
minute
silent
and
irresolute
just
then
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
and
presently
entered
that
very
female
whom
i
had
met
with
at
villars's
i
caught
her
figure
as
i
glanced
through
the
window
mrs
wentworth
darted
at
me
many
significant
glances
which
commanded
me
to
withdraw
but
with
this
object
in
view
it
was
impossible
as
soon
as
she
entered
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
me
certain
recollections
naturally
occurred
at
that
moment
and
made
her
cheeks
glow
some
confusion
reigned
for
a
moment
but
was
quickly
dissipated
she
did
not
notice
me
but
exchanged
salutations
with
her
friend
all
this
while
i
stood
near
the
window
in
a
situation
not
a
little
painful
certain
tremors
which
i
had
not
been
accustomed
to
feel
and
which
seemed
to
possess
a
mystical
relation
to
the
visitant
disabled
me
at
once
from
taking
my
leave
or
from
performing
any
useful
purpose
by
staying
at
length
struggling
for
composure
i
approached
her
and
showing
her
the
card
she
had
given
me
said--
agreeably
to
this
direction
i
called
an
hour
ago
at
your
lodgings
i
found
you
not
i
hope
you
will
permit
me
to
call
once
more
when
shall
i
expect
to
meet
you
at
home
her
eyes
were
cast
on
the
floor
a
kind
of
indirect
attention
was
fixed
on
mrs
wentworth
serving
to
intimidate
and
check
her
at
length
she
said
in
an
irresolute
voice
i
shall
be
at
home
this
evening
and
this
evening
replied
i
i
will
call
to
see
you
so
saying
i
left
the
house
this
interval
was
tedious
but
was
to
be
endured
with
equanimity
i
was
impatient
to
be
gone
to
baltimore
and
hoped
to
be
able
to
set
out
by
the
dawn
of
next
day
meanwhile
i
was
necessarily
to
perform
something
with
respect
to
clemenza
after
dinner
i
accompanied
mrs
stevens
to
visit
miss
carlton
i
was
eager
to
see
a
woman
who
could
bear
adversity
in
the
manner
which
my
friend
had
described
she
met
us
at
the
door
of
her
apartment
her
seriousness
was
not
abated
by
her
smiles
of
affability
and
welcome
my
friend
whispered
i
how
truly
lovely
is
this
miss
carlton
are
the
heart
and
the
intelligence
within
worthy
of
these
features
yes
they
are
the
account
of
her
employments
of
her
resignation
to
the
ill
fate
of
the
brother
whom
she
loves
proves
that
they
are
my
eyes
were
riveted
to
her
countenance
and
person
i
felt
uncontrollable
eagerness
to
speak
to
her
and
to
gain
her
good
opinion
you
must
know
this
young
man
my
dear
miss
carlton
said
my
friend
looking
at
me
he
is
my
husband's
friend
and
professes
a
great
desire
to
be
yours
you
must
not
treat
him
as
a
mere
stranger
for
he
knows
your
character
and
situation
already
as
well
as
that
of
your
brother
she
looked
at
me
with
benignity--i
accept
his
friendship
willingly
and
gratefully
and
shall
endeavour
to
convince
him
that
his
good
opinion
is
not
misplaced
there
now
ensued
a
conversation
somewhat
general
in
which
this
young
woman
showed
a
mind
vigorous
from
exercise
and
unembarrassed
by
care
she
affected
no
concealment
of
her
own
condition
of
her
wants
or
her
comforts
she
laid
no
stress
upon
misfortunes
but
contrived
to
deduce
some
beneficial
consequence
to
herself
and
some
motive
for
gratitude
to
heaven
from
every
wayward
incident
that
had
befallen
her
this
demeanour
emboldened
me
at
length
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
her
brother's
imprisonment
and
the
nature
of
his
debt
she
answered
frankly
and
without
hesitation--it
is
a
debt
of
his
father's
for
which
he
made
himself
responsible
during
his
father's
life
the
act
was
generous
but
imprudent
as
the
event
has
shown
though
at
the
time
the
unhappy
effects
could
not
be
foreseen
my
father
continued
she
was
arrested
by
his
creditor
at
a
time
when
the
calmness
and
comforts
of
his
own
dwelling
were
necessary
to
his
health
the
creditor
was
obdurate
and
would
release
him
upon
no
condition
but
that
of
receiving
a
bond
from
my
brother
by
which
he
engaged
to
pay
the
debt
at
several
successive
times
and
in
small
portions
all
these
instalments
were
discharged
with
great
difficulty
indeed
but
with
sufficient
punctuality
except
the
last
to
which
my
brother's
earnings
were
not
adequate
how
much
is
the
debt
four
hundred
dollars
and
is
the
state
of
the
creditor
such
as
to
make
the
loss
of
four
hundred
dollars
of
more
importance
to
him
than
the
loss
of
liberty
to
your
brother
she
answered
smiling
that
is
a
very
abstract
view
of
things
on
such
a
question
you
and
i
might
perhaps
easily
decide
in
favour
of
my
brother
but
would
there
not
be
some
danger
of
deciding
partially
his
conduct
is
a
proof
of
his
decision
and
there
is
no
power
to
change
it
will
not
argument
change
it
methinks
in
so
plain
a
case
i
should
be
able
to
convince
him
you
say
he
is
rich
and
childless
his
annual
income
is
ten
times
more
than
this
sum
your
brother
cannot
pay
the
debt
while
in
prison
whereas
if
at
liberty
he
might
slowly
and
finally
discharge
it
if
his
humanity
would
not
yield
his
avarice
might
be
brought
to
acquiesce
but
there
is
another
passion
which
you
would
find
it
somewhat
harder
to
subdue
and
that
is
his
vengeance
he
thinks
himself
wronged
and
imprisons
my
brother
not
to
enforce
payment
but
to
inflict
misery
if
you
could
persuade
him
that
there
is
no
hardship
in
imprisonment
you
would
speedily
gain
the
victory
but
that
could
not
be
attempted
consistently
with
truth
in
proportion
to
my
brother's
suffering
is
his
gratification
you
draw
an
odious
and
almost
incredible
portrait
and
yet
such
a
one
would
serve
for
the
likeness
of
almost
every
second
man
we
meet
and
is
such
your
opinion
of
mankind
your
experience
must
surely
have
been
of
a
rueful
tenor
to
justify
such
hard
thoughts
of
the
rest
of
your
species
by
no
means
it
has
been
what
those
whose
situation
disables
them
from
looking
further
than
the
surface
of
things
would
regard
as
unfortunate
but
if
my
goods
and
evils
were
equitably
balanced
the
former
would
be
the
weightiest
i
have
found
kindness
and
goodness
in
great
numbers
but
have
likewise
met
prejudice
and
rancor
in
many
my
opinion
of
farquhar
is
not
lightly
taken
up
i
saw
him
yesterday
and
the
nature
of
his
motives
in
the
treatment
of
my
brother
was
plain
enough
here
this
topic
was
succeeded
by
others
and
the
conversation
ceased
not
till
the
hour
had
arrived
on
which
i
had
preconcerted
to
visit
mrs
fielding
i
left
my
two
friends
for
this
purpose
i
was
admitted
to
mrs
fielding's
presence
without
scruple
or
difficulty
there
were
two
females
in
her
company
and
one
of
the
other
sex
well-dressed
elderly
and
sedate
persons
their
discourse
turned
upon
political
topics
with
which
as
you
know
i
have
but
slight
acquaintance
they
talked
of
fleets
and
armies
of
robespierre
and
pitt
of
whom
i
had
only
a
newspaper-knowledge
in
a
short
time
the
women
rose
and
huddling
on
their
cloaks
disappeared
in
company
with
the
gentleman
being
thus
left
alone
with
mrs
fielding
some
embarrassment
was
mutually
betrayed
with
much
hesitation
which
however
gradually
disappeared
my
companion
at
length
began
the
conversation--
you
met
me
lately
in
a
situation
sir
on
which
i
look
back
with
trembling
and
shame
but
not
with
any
self-condemnation
i
was
led
into
it
without
any
fault
unless
a
too
hasty
confidence
may
be
styled
a
fault
i
had
known
mrs
villars
in
england
where
she
lived
with
an
untainted
reputation
at
least
and
the
sight
of
my
countrywoman
in
a
foreign
land
awakened
emotions
in
the
indulgence
of
which
i
did
not
imagine
there
was
either
any
guilt
or
any
danger
she
invited
me
to
see
her
at
her
house
with
so
much
urgency
and
warmth
and
solicited
me
to
take
a
place
immediately
in
a
chaise
in
which
she
had
come
to
the
city
that
i
too
incautiously
complied
you
are
a
stranger
to
me
and
i
am
unacquainted
with
your
character
what
little
i
have
seen
of
your
deportment
and
what
little
i
have
lately
heard
concerning
you
from
mrs
wentworth
do
not
produce
unfavourable
impressions
but
the
apology
i
have
made
was
due
to
my
own
reputation
and
should
have
been
offered
to
you
whatever
your
character
had
been
there
she
stopped
i
came
not
hither
said
i
to
receive
an
apology
your
demeanour
on
our
first
interview
shielded
you
sufficiently
from
any
suspicions
or
surmises
that
i
could
form
what
you
have
now
mentioned
was
likewise
mentioned
by
your
friend
and
was
fully
believed
upon
her
authority
my
purpose
in
coming
related
not
to
you
but
to
another
i
desired
merely
to
interest
your
generosity
and
justice
on
behalf
of
one
whose
destitute
and
dangerous
condition
may
lay
claim
to
your
compassion
and
your
succour
i
comprehend
you
said
she
with
an
air
of
some
perplexity
i
know
the
claims
of
that
person
and
will
you
comply
with
them
in
what
manner
can
i
serve
her
by
giving
her
the
means
of
living
does
she
not
possess
them
already
she
is
destitute
her
dependence
was
wholly
placed
upon
one
that
is
dead
by
whom
her
person
was
dishonoured
and
her
fortune
embezzled
but
she
still
lives
she
is
not
turned
into
the
street
she
is
not
destitute
of
home
but
what
a
home
such
as
she
may
choose
to
remain
in
she
cannot
choose
it
she
must
not
choose
it
she
remains
through
ignorance
or
through
the
incapacity
of
leaving
it
but
how
shall
she
be
persuaded
to
a
change
i
will
persuade
her
i
will
fully
explain
her
situation
i
will
supply
her
with
a
new
home
you
will
persuade
her
to
go
with
you
and
to
live
at
a
home
of
your
providing
and
on
your
bounty
certainly
would
that
change
be
worthy
of
a
cautious
person
would
it
benefit
her
reputation
would
it
prove
her
love
of
independence
my
purposes
are
good
i
know
not
why
she
should
suspect
them
but
i
am
only
anxious
to
be
the
instrument
let
her
be
indebted
to
one
of
her
own
sex
of
unquestionable
reputation
admit
her
into
this
house
invite
her
to
your
arms
cherish
and
console
her
as
your
sister
before
i
am
convinced
that
she
deserves
it
and
even
then
what
regard
shall
i
young
unmarried
independent
affluent
pay
to
my
own
reputation
in
harbouring
a
woman
in
these
circumstances
but
you
need
not
act
yourself
make
me
your
agent
and
almoner
only
supply
her
with
the
means
of
subsistence
through
me
would
you
have
me
act
a
clandestine
part
hold
meetings
with
one
of
your
sex
and
give
him
money
for
a
purpose
which
i
must
hide
from
the
world
is
it
worth
while
to
be
a
dissembler
and
impostor
and
will
not
such
conduct
incur
more
dangerous
surmises
and
suspicions
than
would
arise
from
acting
openly
and
directly
you
will
forgive
me
for
reminding
you
likewise
that
it
is
particularly
incumbent
upon
those
in
my
situation
to
be
circumspect
in
their
intercourse
with
men
and
with
strangers
this
is
the
second
time
that
i
have
seen
you
my
knowledge
of
you
is
extremely
dubious
and
imperfect
and
such
as
would
make
the
conduct
you
prescribe
to
me
in
a
high
degree
rash
and
culpable
you
must
not
therefore
expect
me
to
pursue
it
these
words
were
delivered
with
an
air
of
firmness
and
dignity
i
was
not
insensible
to
the
truth
of
her
representations
i
confess
said
i
what
you
have
said
makes
me
doubt
the
propriety
of
my
proposal
yet
i
would
fain
be
of
service
to
her
cannot
you
point
out
some
practicable
method
she
was
silent
and
thoughtful
and
seemed
indisposed
to
answer
my
question
i
had
set
my
heart
upon
success
in
this
negotiation
continued
i
and
could
not
imagine
any
obstacle
to
its
success
but
i
find
my
ignorance
of
the
world's
ways
much
greater
than
i
had
previously
expected
you
defraud
yourself
of
all
the
happiness
redounding
from
the
act
of
making
others
happy
you
sacrifice
substance
to
show
and
are
more
anxious
to
prevent
unjust
aspersions
from
lighting
on
yourself
than
to
rescue
a
fellow-creature
from
guilt
and
infamy
you
are
rich
and
abound
in
all
the
conveniences
and
luxuries
of
life
a
small
portion
of
your
superfluity
would
obviate
the
wants
of
a
being
not
less
worthy
than
yourself
it
is
not
avarice
or
aversion
to
labour
that
makes
you
withhold
your
hand
it
is
dread
of
the
sneers
and
surmises
of
malevolence
and
ignorance
i
will
not
urge
you
further
at
present
your
determination
to
be
wise
should
not
be
hasty
think
upon
the
subject
calmly
and
sedately
and
form
your
resolution
in
the
course
of
three
days
at
the
end
of
that
period
i
will
visit
you
again
so
saying
and
without
waiting
for
comment
or
answer
i
withdrew
i
mounted
the
stage-coach
at
daybreak
the
next
day
in
company
with
a
sallow
frenchman
from
st
domingo
his
fiddle-case
an
ape
and
two
female
blacks
the
frenchman
after
passing
the
suburbs
took
out
his
violin
and
amused
himself
with
humming
to
his
own
tweedle-tweedle
the
monkey
now
and
then
munched
an
apple
which
was
given
to
him
from
a
basket
by
the
blacks
who
gazed
with
stupid
wonder
and
an
exclamatory
la
la
upon
the
passing
scenery
or
chattered
to
each
other
in
a
sort
of
open-mouthed
half-articulate
monotonous
singsong
jargon
the
man
looked
seldom
either
on
this
side
or
that
and
spoke
only
to
rebuke
the
frolics
of
the
monkey
with
a
tenez
dominique
prenez
garde
diable
noir
as
to
me
my
thought
was
busy
in
a
thousand
ways
i
sometimes
gazed
at
the
faces
of
my
four
companions
and
endeavoured
to
discern
the
differences
and
samenesses
between
them
i
took
an
exact
account
of
the
features
proportions
looks
and
gestures
of
the
monkey
the
congolese
and
the
creole
gaul
i
compared
them
together
and
examined
them
apart
i
looked
at
them
in
a
thousand
different
points
of
view
and
pursued
untired
and
unsatiated
those
trains
of
reflections
which
began
at
each
change
of
tone
feature
and
attitude
i
marked
the
country
as
it
successively
arose
before
me
and
found
endless
employment
in
examining
the
shape
and
substance
of
the
fence
the
barn
and
the
cottage
the
aspect
of
earth
and
of
heaven
how
great
are
the
pleasures
of
health
and
of
mental
activity
my
chief
occupation
however
related
to
the
scenes
into
which
i
was
about
to
enter
my
imaginations
were
of
course
crude
and
inadequate
and
i
found
an
uncommon
gratification
in
comparing
realities
as
they
successively
occurred
with
the
pictures
which
my
wayward
fancy
had
depicted
i
will
not
describe
my
dreams
my
proper
task
is
to
relate
the
truth
neither
shall
i
dwell
upon
the
images
suggested
by
the
condition
of
the
country
through
which
i
passed
i
will
confine
myself
to
mentioning
the
transactions
connected
with
the
purpose
of
my
journey
i
reached
baltimore
at
night
i
was
not
so
fatigued
but
that
i
could
ramble
through
the
town
i
intended
at
present
merely
the
gratification
of
a
stranger's
curiosity
my
visit
to
mrs
watson
and
her
brother
i
designed
should
take
place
on
the
morrow
the
evening
of
my
arrival
i
deemed
an
unseasonable
time
while
roving
about
however
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
not
be
impolitic
to
find
the
way
to
their
habitation
even
now
my
purposes
of
general
curiosity
would
equally
be
served
whichever
way
my
steps
were
bent
and
to
trace
the
path
to
their
dwelling
would
save
me
the
trouble
of
inquiries
and
interrogations
to-morrow
when
i
looked
forward
to
an
interview
with
the
wife
of
watson
and
to
the
subject
which
would
be
necessarily
discussed
at
that
interview
i
felt
a
trembling
and
misgiving
at
my
heart
surely
thought
i
it
will
become
me
to
exercise
immeasurable
circumspection
and
address
and
yet
how
little
are
these
adapted
to
the
impetuosity
and
candour
of
my
nature
how
am
i
to
introduce
myself
what
am
i
to
tell
her
that
i
was
a
sort
of
witness
to
the
murder
of
her
husband
that
i
received
from
the
hand
of
his
assassin
the
letter
which
i
afterwards
transmitted
to
her
and
from
the
same
hands
the
bills
contained
in
his
girdle
how
will
she
start
and
look
aghast
what
suspicions
will
she
harbour
what
inquiries
shall
be
made
of
me
how
shall
they
be
disarmed
and
eluded
or
answered
deep
consideration
will
be
necessary
before
i
trust
myself
to
such
an
interview
the
coming
night
shall
be
devoted
to
reflection
upon
this
subject
from
these
thoughts
i
proceeded
to
inquiries
for
the
street
mentioned
in
the
advertisement
where
mrs
watson
was
said
to
reside
the
street
and
at
length
the
habitation
was
found
having
reached
a
station
opposite
i
paused
and
surveyed
the
mansion
it
was
a
wooden
edifice
of
two
stories
humble
but
neat
you
ascended
to
the
door
by
several
stone
steps
of
the
two
lower
windows
the
shutters
of
one
were
closed
but
those
of
the
other
were
open
though
late
in
the
evening
there
was
no
appearance
of
light
or
fire
within
beside
the
house
was
a
painted
fence
through
which
was
a
gate
leading
to
the
back
of
the
building
guided
by
the
impulse
of
the
moment
i
crossed
the
street
to
the
gate
and
lifting
the
latch
entered
the
paved
alley
on
one
side
of
which
was
a
paled
fence
and
on
the
other
the
house
looking
through
two
windows
into
the
alley
the
first
window
was
dark
like
those
in
front
but
at
the
second
a
light
was
discernible
i
approached
it
and
looking
through
beheld
a
plain
but
neat
apartment
in
which
parlour
kitchen
and
nursery
seemed
to
be
united
a
fire
burned
cheerfully
in
the
chimney
over
which
was
a
tea-kettle
on
the
hearth
sat
a
smiling
and
playful
cherub
of
a
boy
tossing
something
to
a
black
girl
who
sat
opposite
and
whose
innocent
and
regular
features
wanted
only
a
different
hue
to
make
them
beautiful
near
it
in
a
rocking-chair
with
a
sleeping
babe
in
her
lap
sat
a
female
figure
in
plain
but
neat
and
becoming
attire
her
posture
permitted
half
her
face
to
be
seen
and
saved
me
from
any
danger
of
being
observed
this
countenance
was
full
of
sweetness
and
benignity
but
the
sadness
that
veiled
its
lustre
was
profound
her
eyes
were
now
fixed
upon
the
fire
and
were
moist
with
the
tears
of
remembrance
while
she
sung
in
low
and
scarcely-audible
strains
an
artless
lullaby
this
spectacle
exercised
a
strange
power
over
my
feelings
while
occupied
in
meditating
on
the
features
of
the
mother
i
was
unaware
of
my
conspicuous
situation
the
black
girl
having
occasion
to
change
her
situation
in
order
to
reach
the
ball
which
was
thrown
at
her
unluckily
caught
a
glance
of
my
figure
through
the
glass
in
a
tone
of
half
surprise
and
half
terror
she
cried
out
oh
see
dare
a
man
i
was
tempted
to
draw
suddenly
back
but
a
second
thought
showed
me
the
impropriety
of
departing
thus
abruptly
and
leaving
behind
me
some
alarm
i
felt
a
sort
of
necessity
for
apologizing
for
my
intrusion
into
these
precincts
and
hastened
to
a
door
that
led
into
the
same
apartment
i
knocked
a
voice
somewhat
confused
bade
me
enter
it
was
not
till
i
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
room
that
i
fully
saw
in
what
embarrassments
i
had
incautiously
involved
myself
i
could
scarcely
obtain
sufficient
courage
to
speak
and
gave
a
confused
assent
to
the
question
have
you
business
with
me
sir
she
offered
me
a
chair
and
i
sat
down
she
put
the
child
not
yet
awakened
into
the
arms
of
the
black
who
kissed
it
and
rocked
it
in
her
arms
with
great
satisfaction
and
resuming
her
seat
looked
at
me
with
inquisitiveness
mingled
with
complacency
after
a
moment's
pause
i
said
i
was
directed
to
this
house
as
the
abode
of
mr
ephraim
williams
can
he
be
seen
madam
he
is
not
in
town
at
present
if
you
will
leave
a
message
with
me
i
will
punctually
deliver
it
the
thought
suddenly
occurred
whether
any
more
was
needful
than
merely
to
leave
the
bills
suitably
enclosed
as
they
already
were
in
a
packet
thus
all
painful
explanations
might
be
avoided
and
i
might
have
reason
to
congratulate
myself
on
his
seasonable
absence
actuated
by
these
thoughts
i
drew
forth
the
packet
and
put
it
into
her
hand
saying
i
will
leave
this
in
your
possession
and
must
earnestly
request
you
to
keep
it
safe
until
you
can
deliver
it
into
his
own
hands
scarcely
had
i
said
this
before
new
suggestions
occurred
was
it
right
to
act
in
this
clandestine
and
mysterious
manner
should
i
leave
these
persons
in
uncertainty
respecting
the
fate
of
a
husband
and
a
brother
what
perplexities
misunderstandings
and
suspenses
might
not
grow
out
of
this
uncertainty
and
ought
they
not
to
be
precluded
at
any
hazard
to
my
own
safety
or
good
name
these
sentiments
made
me
involuntarily
stretch
forth
my
hand
to
retake
the
packet
this
gesture
and
other
significances
in
my
manners
joined
to
a
trembling
consciousness
in
herself
filled
my
companion
with
all
the
tokens
of
confusion
and
fear
she
alternately
looked
at
me
and
at
the
paper
her
trepidation
increased
and
she
grew
pale
these
emotions
were
counteracted
by
a
strong
effort
at
length
she
said
falteringly
i
will
take
good
care
of
them
and
will
give
them
to
my
brother
she
rose
and
placed
them
in
a
drawer
after
which
she
resumed
her
seat
on
this
occasion
all
my
wariness
forsook
me
i
cannot
explain
why
my
perplexity
and
the
trouble
of
my
thoughts
were
greater
upon
this
than
upon
similar
occasions
however
it
be
i
was
incapable
of
speaking
and
fixed
my
eyes
upon
the
floor
a
sort
of
electrical
sympathy
pervaded
my
companion
and
terror
and
anguish
were
strongly
manifested
in
the
glances
which
she
sometimes
stole
at
me
we
seemed
fully
to
understand
each
other
without
the
aid
of
words
this
imbecility
could
not
last
long
i
gradually
recovered
my
composure
and
collected
my
scattered
thoughts
i
looked
at
her
with
seriousness
and
steadfastly
spoke--are
you
the
wife
of
amos
watson
she
started--i
am
indeed
why
do
you
ask
do
you
know
any
thing
of----
there
her
voice
failed
i
replied
with
quickness
yes
i
am
fully
acquainted
with
his
destiny
good
god
she
exclaimed
in
a
paroxysm
of
surprise
and
bending
eagerly
forward
my
husband
is
then
alive
this
packet
is
from
him
where
is
he
when
have
you
seen
him
'tis
a
long
time
since
but
where
where
is
he
now
is
he
well
will
he
return
to
me
never
merciful
heaven
looking
upwards
and
clasping
her
hands
i
thank
thee
at
least
for
his
life
but
why
has
he
forsaken
me
why
will
he
not
return
for
a
good
reason
said
i
with
augmented
solemnity
he
will
never
return
to
thee
long
ago
was
he
laid
in
the
cold
grave
she
shrieked
and
at
the
next
moment
sunk
in
a
swoon
upon
the
floor
i
was
alarmed
the
two
children
shrieked
and
ran
about
the
room
terrified
and
unknowing
what
they
did
i
was
overwhelmed
with
somewhat
like
terror
yet
i
involuntarily
raised
the
mother
in
my
arms
and
cast
about
for
the
means
of
recalling
her
from
this
fit
time
to
effect
this
had
not
elapsed
when
several
persons
apparently
mrs
watson's
neighbours
and
raised
by
the
outcries
of
the
girls
hastily
entered
the
room
they
looked
at
me
with
mingled
surprise
and
suspicion
but
my
attitude
being
not
that
of
an
injurer
but
helper
my
countenance
which
showed
the
pleasure
their
entrance
at
this
critical
moment
afforded
me
and
my
words
in
which
i
besought
their
assistance
and
explained
in
some
degree
and
briefly
the
cause
of
those
appearances
removed
their
ill
thoughts
presently
the
unhappy
woman
being
carried
by
the
new-comers
into
a
bedroom
adjoining
recovered
her
sensibility
i
only
waited
for
this
i
had
done
my
part
more
information
would
be
useless
to
her
and
not
to
be
given
by
me
at
least
in
the
present
audience
without
embarrassment
and
peril
i
suddenly
determined
to
withdraw
and
this
the
attention
of
the
company
being
otherwise
engaged
i
did
without
notice
i
returned
to
my
inn
and
shut
myself
up
in
my
chamber
such
was
the
change
which
undesigned
unforeseen
half
an
hour
had
wrought
in
my
situation
my
cautious
projects
had
perished
in
their
conception
that
which
i
had
deemed
so
arduous
to
require
such
circumspect
approaches
such
well-concerted
speeches
was
done
i
had
started
up
before
this
woman
as
if
from
the
pores
of
the
ground
i
had
vanished
with
the
same
celerity
but
had
left
her
in
possession
of
proofs
sufficient
that
i
was
neither
spectre
nor
demon
i
will
visit
her
said
i
again
i
will
see
her
brother
and
know
the
full
effect
of
my
disclosure
i
will
tell
them
all
that
i
myself
know
ignorance
would
be
no
less
injurious
to
them
than
to
myself
but
first
i
will
see
the
maurices
next
morning
i
arose
betimes
and
equipped
myself
without
delay
i
had
eight
or
ten
miles
to
walk
so
far
from
the
town
being
the
residence
of
these
people
and
i
forthwith
repaired
to
their
dwelling
the
persons
whom
i
desired
to
see
were
known
to
me
only
by
name
and
by
their
place
of
abode
it
was
a
mother
and
her
three
daughters
to
whom
i
now
carried
the
means
not
only
of
competence
but
riches
means
which
they
no
doubt
had
long
ago
despaired
of
regaining
and
which
among
all
possible
messengers
one
of
my
age
and
guise
would
be
the
least
suspected
of
being
able
to
restore
i
arrived
through
intricate
ways
at
eleven
o'clock
at
the
house
of
mrs
maurice
it
was
a
neat
dwelling
in
a
very
fanciful
and
rustic
style
in
the
bosom
of
a
valley
which
when
decorated
by
the
verdure
and
blossoms
of
the
coming
season
must
possess
many
charms
at
present
it
was
naked
and
dreary
as
i
approached
it
through
a
long
avenue
i
observed
two
female
figures
walking
arm-in-arm
and
slowly
to
and
fro
in
the
path
in
which
i
now
was
these
said
i
are
daughters
of
the
family
graceful
well-dressed
fashionable
girls
they
seem
at
this
distance
may
they
be
deserving
of
the
good
tidings
which
i
bring
seeing
them
turn
towards
the
house
i
mended
my
pace
that
i
might
overtake
them
and
request
their
introduction
of
me
to
their
mother
as
i
more
nearly
approached
they
again
turned
and
perceiving
me
they
stood
as
if
in
expectation
of
my
message
i
went
up
to
them
a
single
glance
cast
at
each
made
me
suspect
that
they
were
not
sisters
but
somewhat
to
my
disappointment
there
was
nothing
highly
prepossessing
in
the
countenance
of
either
they
were
what
is
every
day
met
with
though
less
embellished
by
brilliant
drapery
and
turban
in
markets
and
streets
an
air
somewhat
haughty
somewhat
supercilious
lessened
still
more
their
attractions
these
defects
however
were
nothing
to
me
i
inquired
of
her
that
seemed
to
be
the
elder
of
the
two
for
mrs
maurice
she
is
indisposed
was
the
cold
reply
that
is
unfortunate
is
it
not
possible
to
see
her
no
with
still
more
gravity
i
was
somewhat
at
a
loss
how
to
proceed
a
pause
ensued
at
length
the
same
lady
resumed
what's
your
business
you
can
leave
your
message
with
me
with
nobody
but
her
if
she
be
not
very
indisposed----
she
is
very
indisposed
interrupted
she
peevishly
if
you
cannot
leave
your
message
you
may
take
it
back
again
for
she
must
not
be
disturbed
this
was
a
singular
reception
i
was
disconcerted
and
silent
i
knew
not
what
to
say
perhaps
i
at
last
observed
some
other
time----
no
with
increasing
heat
no
other
time
she
is
more
likely
to
be
worse
than
better
come
betsy
said
she
taking
hold
of
her
companion's
arm
and
hieing
into
the
house
shut
the
door
after
her
and
disappeared
i
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
confounded
at
such
strange
and
unexpected
treatment
i
could
not
withdraw
till
my
purpose
was
accomplished
after
a
moment's
pause
i
stepped
to
the
door
and
pulled
the
bell
a
negro
came
of
a
very
unpropitious
aspect
and
opening
the
door
looked
at
me
in
silence
to
my
question
was
mrs
maurice
to
be
seen
he
made
some
answer
in
a
jargon
which
i
could
not
understand
but
his
words
were
immediately
followed
by
an
unseen
person
within
the
house--mrs
maurice
can't
be
seen
by
anybody
come
in
cato
and
shut
the
door
this
injunction
was
obeyed
by
cato
without
ceremony
here
was
a
dilemma
i
came
with
ten
thousand
pounds
in
my
hands
to
bestow
freely
on
these
people
and
such
was
the
treatment
i
received
i
must
adopt
said
i
a
new
mode
i
lifted
the
latch
without
a
second
warning
and
cato
having
disappeared
went
into
a
room
the
door
of
which
chanced
to
be
open
on
my
right
hand
i
found
within
the
two
females
whom
i
had
accosted
in
the
portico
i
now
addressed
myself
to
the
younger--this
intrusion
when
i
have
explained
the
reason
of
it
will
i
hope
be
forgiven
i
come
madam----
yes
interrupted
the
other
with
a
countenance
suffused
by
indignation
i
know
very
well
whom
you
come
from
and
what
it
is
that
prompts
this
insolence
but
your
employer
shall
see
that
we
have
not
sunk
so
low
as
he
imagines
cato
bob
i
say
my
employer
madam
i
see
you
labour
under
some
great
mistake
i
have
no
employer
i
come
from
a
great
distance
i
come
to
bring
intelligence
of
the
utmost
importance
to
your
family
i
come
to
benefit
and
not
to
injure
you
by
this
time
bob
and
cato
two
sturdy
blacks
entered
the
room
turn
this
person
said
the
imperious
lady
regardless
of
my
explanations
out
of
the
house
don't
you
hear
me
she
continued
observing
that
they
looked
one
upon
the
other
and
hesitated
surely
madam
said
i
you
are
precipitate
you
are
treating
like
an
enemy
one
who
will
prove
himself
your
mother's
best
friend
will
you
leave
the
house
she
exclaimed
quite
beside
herself
with
anger
villains
why
don't
you
do
as
i
bid
you
the
blacks
looked
upon
each
other
as
if
waiting
for
an
example
their
habitual
deference
for
every
thing
white
no
doubt
held
their
hands
from
what
they
regarded
as
a
profanation
at
last
bob
said
in
a
whining
beseeching
tone
why
missee
massa
buckra
wanna
go
for
doo
dan
he
winna
go
fo'
wee
the
lady
now
burst
into
tears
of
rage
she
held
out
her
hand
menacingly
will
you
leave
the
house
not
willingly
said
i
in
a
mild
tone
i
came
too
far
to
return
with
the
business
that
brought
me
unperformed
i
am
persuaded
madam
you
mistake
my
character
and
my
views
i
have
a
message
to
deliver
your
mother
which
deeply
concerns
her
and
your
happiness
if
you
are
her
daughter
i
merely
wished
to
see
her
and
leave
with
her
a
piece
of
important
news
news
in
which
her
fortune
is
deeply
interested
these
words
had
a
wonderful
effect
upon
the
young
lady
her
anger
was
checked
good
god
she
exclaimed
are
you
watson
no
i
am
only
watson's
representative
and
come
to
do
all
that
watson
could
do
if
he
were
present
she
was
now
importunate
to
know
my
business
my
business
lies
with
mrs
maurice
advertisements
which
i
have
seen
direct
me
to
her
and
to
this
house
and
to
her
only
shall
i
deliver
my
message
perhaps
said
she
with
a
face
of
apology
i
have
mistaken
you
mrs
maurice
is
my
mother
she
is
really
indisposed
but
i
can
stand
in
her
place
on
this
occasion
you
cannot
represent
her
in
this
instance
if
i
cannot
have
access
to
her
now
i
must
go
and
shall
return
when
you
are
willing
to
grant
it
nay
replied
she
she
is
not
perhaps
so
very
sick
but
that
i
will
go
and
see
if
she
will
admit
you
so
saying
she
left
me
for
three
minutes
and
returning
said
her
mother
wished
to
see
me
i
followed
up-stairs
at
her
request
and
entering
an
ill-furnished
chamber
found
seated
in
an
arm-chair
a
lady
seemingly
in
years
pale
and
visibly
infirm
the
lines
of
her
countenance
were
far
from
laying
claim
to
my
reverence
it
was
too
much
like
the
daughter's
she
looked
at
me
at
my
entrance
with
great
eagerness
and
said
in
a
sharp
tone
pray
friend
what
is
it
you
want
with
me
make
haste
tell
your
story
and
begone
my
story
is
a
short
one
and
easily
told
amos
watson
was
your
agent
in
jamaica
he
sold
an
estate
belonging
to
you
and
received
the
money
he
did
said
she
attempting
ineffectually
to
rise
from
her
seat
and
her
eyes
beaming
with
a
significance
that
shocked
me
he
did
the
villain
and
purloined
the
money
to
the
ruin
of
me
and
my
daughters
but
if
there
be
justice
on
earth
it
will
overtake
him
i
trust
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
one
day--i
hope
to
hear
he's
hanged
well
but
go
on
friend
he
did
sell
it
i
tell
you
he
sold
it
for
ten
thousand
pounds
i
resumed
and
invested
this
sum
in
bills
of
exchange
watson
is
dead
these
bills
came
into
my
hands
i
was
lately
informed
by
the
public
papers
who
were
the
real
owners
and
have
come
from
philadelphia
with
no
other
view
than
to
restore
them
to
you
there
they
are
continued
i
placing
them
in
her
lap
entire
and
untouched
she
seized
the
papers
and
looked
at
me
and
at
her
daughter
by
turns
with
an
air
of
one
suddenly
bewildered
she
seemed
speechless
and
growing
suddenly
more
ghastly
pale
leaned
her
head
back
upon
the
chair
the
daughter
screamed
and
hastened
to
support
the
languid
parent
who
difficultly
articulated
oh
i
am
sick
sick
to
death
put
me
on
the
bed
i
was
astonished
and
affrighted
at
this
scene
some
of
the
domestics
of
both
colours
entered
and
gazed
at
me
with
surprise
involuntarily
i
withdrew
and
returned
to
the
room
below
into
which
i
had
first
entered
and
which
i
now
found
deserted
i
was
for
some
time
at
a
loss
to
guess
at
the
cause
of
these
appearances
at
length
it
occurred
to
me
that
joy
was
the
source
of
the
sickness
that
had
seized
mrs
maurice
the
abrupt
recovery
of
what
had
probably
been
deemed
irretrievable
would
naturally
produce
this
effect
upon
a
mind
of
a
certain
texture
i
was
deliberating
whether
to
stay
or
go
when
the
daughter
entered
the
room
and
after
expressing
some
surprise
at
seeing
me
whom
she
supposed
to
have
retired
told
me
that
her
mother
wished
to
see
me
again
before
my
departure
in
this
request
there
was
no
kindness
all
was
cold
supercilious
and
sullen
i
obeyed
the
summons
without
speaking
i
found
mrs
maurice
seated
in
her
arm-chair
much
in
her
former
guise
without
desiring
me
to
be
seated
or
relaxing
aught
in
her
asperity
of
looks
and
tones--pray
friend
how
did
you
come
by
these
papers
i
assure
you
madam
they
were
honestly
come
by
answered
i
sedately
and
with
half
a
smile
but
if
the
whole
is
there
that
was
missing
the
mode
and
time
in
which
they
came
to
me
is
matter
of
concern
only
to
myself
is
there
any
deficiency
i
am
not
sure
i
don't
know
much
of
these
matters
there
may
be
less
i
dare
say
there
is
i
shall
know
that
soon
i
expect
a
friend
of
mine
every
minute
who
will
look
them
over
i
don't
doubt
you
can
give
a
good
account
of
yourself
i
doubt
not
but
i
can--to
those
who
have
a
right
to
demand
it
in
this
case
curiosity
must
be
very
urgent
indeed
before
i
shall
consent
to
gratify
it
you
must
know
this
is
a
suspicious
case
watson
to-be-sure
embezzled
the
money
to-be-sure
you
are
his
accomplice
certainly
said
i
my
conduct
on
this
occasion
proves
that
what
i
have
brought
to
you
of
my
own
accord
what
i
have
restored
to
you
fully
and
unconditionally
it
is
plain
watson
embezzled
and
that
i
was
aiding
in
the
fraud
to
restore
what
was
never
stolen
always
betrays
the
thief
to
give
what
might
be
kept
without
suspicion
is
without
doubt
arrant
knavery
to
be
serious
madam
in
coming
thus
far
for
this
purpose
i
have
done
enough
and
must
now
bid
you
farewell
nay
don't
go
yet
i
have
something
more
to
say
to
you
my
friend
i'm
sure
will
be
here
presently
there
he
is
noticing
a
peal
upon
the
bell
polly
go
down
and
see
if
that's
mr
somers
if
it
is
bring
him
up
the
daughter
went
i
walked
to
the
window
absorbed
in
my
own
reflections
i
was
disappointed
and
dejected
the
scene
before
me
was
the
unpleasing
reverse
of
all
that
my
fancy
while
coming
hither
had
foreboded
i
expected
to
find
virtuous
indigence
and
sorrow
lifted
by
my
means
to
affluence
and
exultation
i
expected
to
witness
the
tears
of
gratitude
and
the
caresses
of
affection
what
had
i
found
nothing
but
sordidness
stupidity
and
illiberal
suspicion
the
daughter
stayed
much
longer
than
the
mother's
patience
could
endure
she
knocked
against
the
floor
with
her
heel
a
servant
came
up
where's
polly
you
slut
it
was
not
you
hussy
that
i
wanted
it
was
her
she
is
talking
in
the
parlour
with
a
gentleman
mr
somers
i
suppose
hey
fool
run
with
my
compliments
to
him
wench
tell
him
please
walk
up
it
is
not
mr
somers
ma'am
no
who
then
saucebox
what
gentleman
can
have
any
thing
to
do
with
polly
i
don't
know
ma'am
who
said
you
did
impertinence
run
and
tell
her
i
want
her
this
instant
the
summons
was
not
delivered
or
polly
did
not
think
proper
to
obey
it
full
ten
minutes
of
thoughtful
silence
on
my
part
and
of
muttered
vexation
and
impatience
on
that
of
the
old
lady
elapsed
before
polly's
entrance
as
soon
as
she
appeared
the
mother
began
to
complain
bitterly
of
her
inattention
and
neglect
but
polly
taking
no
notice
of
her
addressed
herself
to
me
and
told
me
that
a
gentleman
below
wished
to
see
me
i
hastened
down
and
found
a
stranger
of
a
plain
appearance
in
the
parlour
his
aspect
was
liberal
and
ingenuous
and
i
quickly
collected
from
his
discourse
that
this
was
the
brother-in-law
of
watson
and
the
companion
of
his
last
voyage
my
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
at
this
unexpected
interview
and
i
willingly
confessed
my
desire
to
communicate
all
the
knowledge
of
his
brother's
destiny
which
i
possessed
he
told
me
that
returning
late
to
baltimore
on
the
last
evening
he
found
his
sister
in
much
agitation
and
distress
which
after
a
time
she
explained
to
him
she
likewise
put
the
packets
i
had
left
into
his
hands
i
leave
you
to
imagine
continued
he
my
surprise
and
curiosity
at
this
discovery
i
was
of
course
impatient
to
see
the
bearer
of
such
extraordinary
tidings
this
morning
inquiring
for
one
of
your
appearance
at
the
taverns
i
was
at
length
informed
of
your
arrival
yesterday
in
the
stage
of
your
going
out
alone
in
the
evening
of
your
subsequent
return
and
of
your
early
departure
this
morning
accidentally
i
lighted
on
your
footsteps
and
by
suitable
inquiries
on
the
road
have
finally
traced
you
hither
you
told
my
sister
her
husband
was
dead
you
left
with
her
papers
that
were
probably
in
his
possession
at
the
time
of
his
death
i
understand
from
miss
maurice
that
the
bills
belonging
to
her
mother
have
just
been
delivered
to
her
i
presume
you
have
no
objection
to
clear
up
this
mystery
to
you
i
am
anxious
to
unfold
every
thing
at
this
moment
or
at
any
time
but
the
sooner
the
more
agreeable
to
me
i
will
do
it
this
said
he
looking
around
him
is
no
place
there
is
an
inn
not
a
hundred
yards
from
this
gate
where
i
have
left
my
horse
will
you
go
thither
i
readily
consented
and
calling
for
a
private
apartment
i
laid
before
this
man
every
incident
of
my
life
connected
with
welbeck
and
watson
my
full
circumstantial
and
explicit
story
appeared
to
remove
every
doubt
which
he
might
have
entertained
of
my
integrity
in
williams
i
found
a
plain
good
man
of
a
temper
confiding
and
affectionate
my
narration
being
finished
he
expressed
by
unaffected
tokens
his
wonder
and
his
grief
on
account
of
watson's
destiny
to
my
inquiries
which
were
made
with
frankness
and
fervour
respecting
his
own
and
his
sister's
condition
he
said
that
the
situation
of
both
was
deplorable
till
the
recovery
of
this
property
they
had
been
saved
from
utter
ruin
from
beggary
and
a
jail
only
by
the
generosity
and
lenity
of
his
creditors
who
did
not
suffer
the
suspicious
circumstances
attending
watson's
disappearance
to
outweigh
former
proofs
of
his
probity
they
had
never
relinquished
the
hopes
of
receiving
some
tidings
of
their
kinsman
i
related
what
had
just
passed
in
the
house
of
mrs
maurice
and
requested
to
know
from
him
the
history
and
character
of
this
family
they
have
treated
you
he
answered
exactly
as
any
one
who
knew
them
would
have
predicted
the
mother
is
narrow
ignorant
bigoted
and
avaricious
the
eldest
daughter
whom
you
saw
resembles
the
old
lady
in
many
things
age
indeed
may
render
the
similitude
complete
at
present
pride
and
ill-humour
are
her
chief
characteristics
the
youngest
daughter
has
nothing
in
mind
or
person
in
common
with
her
family
where
they
are
irascible
she
is
patient
where
they
are
imperious
she
is
humble
where
they
are
covetous
she
is
liberal
where
they
are
ignorant
and
indolent
she
is
studious
and
skilful
it
is
rare
indeed
to
find
a
young
lady
more
amiable
than
miss
fanny
maurice
or
who
has
had
more
crosses
and
afflictions
to
sustain
the
eldest
daughter
always
extorted
the
supply
of
her
wants
from
her
parents
by
threats
and
importunities
but
the
younger
could
never
be
prevailed
upon
to
employ
the
same
means
and
hence
she
suffered
inconveniences
which
to
any
other
girl
born
to
an
equal
rank
would
have
been
to
the
last
degree
humiliating
and
vexatious
to
her
they
only
afforded
new
opportunities
for
the
display
of
her
most
shining
virtues--fortitude
and
charity
no
instance
of
their
sordidness
or
tyranny
ever
stole
a
murmur
from
her
for
what
they
had
given
existence
and
a
virtuous
education
she
said
they
were
entitled
to
gratitude
what
they
withheld
was
their
own
in
the
use
of
which
they
were
not
accountable
to
her
she
was
not
ashamed
to
owe
her
subsistence
to
her
own
industry
and
was
only
held
by
the
pride
of
her
family--in
this
instance
their
pride
was
equal
to
their
avarice--from
seeking
out
some
lucrative
kind
of
employment
since
the
shock
which
their
fortune
sustained
by
watson's
disappearance
she
has
been
permitted
to
pursue
this
plan
and
she
now
teaches
music
in
baltimore
for
a
living
no
one
however
in
the
highest
rank
can
be
more
generally
respected
and
caressed
than
she
is
but
will
not
the
recovery
of
this
money
make
a
favourable
change
in
her
condition
i
can
hardly
tell
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
it
will
not
it
will
not
change
her
mother's
character
her
pride
may
be
awakened
anew
and
she
may
oblige
miss
fanny
to
relinquish
her
new
profession
and
that
will
be
a
change
to
be
deplored
what
good
has
been
done
then
by
restoring
this
money
if
pleasure
be
good
you
must
have
conferred
a
great
deal
on
the
maurices
upon
the
mother
and
two
of
the
daughters
at
least--the
only
pleasure
indeed
which
their
natures
can
receive
it
is
less
than
if
you
had
raised
them
from
absolute
indigence
which
has
not
been
the
case
since
they
had
wherewithal
to
live
upon
besides
their
jamaica
property
but
how
continued
williams
suddenly
recollecting
himself
have
you
claimed
the
reward
promised
to
him
who
should
restore
these
bills
what
reward
no
less
than
a
thousand
dollars
it
was
publicly
promised
under
the
hands
of
mrs
maurice
and
of
hemmings
her
husband's
executor
really
said
i
that
circumstance
escaped
my
attention
and
i
wonder
that
it
did
but
is
it
too
late
to
repair
the
evil
then
you
have
no
scruple
to
accept
the
reward
certainly
not
could
you
suspect
me
of
so
strange
a
punctilio
as
that
yes
but
i
know
not
why
the
story
you
have
just
finished
taught
me
to
expect
some
unreasonable
refinement
upon
that
head
to
be
hired
to
be
bribed
to
do
our
duty
is
supposed
by
some
to
be
degrading
this
is
no
such
bribe
to
me
i
should
have
acted
just
as
i
have
done
had
no
recompense
been
promised
in
truth
this
has
been
my
conduct
for
i
never
once
thought
of
the
reward
but
now
that
you
remind
me
of
it
i
would
gladly
see
it
bestowed
to
fulfil
their
engagements
in
this
respect
is
no
more
than
justice
in
the
maurices
to
one
in
my
condition
the
money
will
be
highly
useful
if
these
people
were
poor
or
generous
and
worthy
or
if
i
myself
were
already
rich
i
might
less
repine
at
their
withholding
it
but
things
being
as
they
are
with
them
and
with
me
it
would
i
think
be
gross
injustice
in
them
to
withhold
and
in
me
to
refuse
that
injustice
said
williams
will
on
their
part
i
fear
be
committed
'tis
pity
you
first
applied
to
mrs
maurice
nothing
can
be
expected
from
her
avarice
unless
it
be
wrested
from
her
by
a
lawsuit
that
is
a
force
which
i
shall
never
apply
had
you
gone
first
to
hemmings
you
might
i
think
have
looked
for
payment
he
is
not
a
mean
man
a
thousand
dollars
he
must
know
is
not
much
to
give
for
forty
thousand
perhaps
indeed
it
may
not
yet
be
too
late
i
am
well
known
to
him
and
if
you
please
will
attend
you
to
him
in
the
evening
and
state
your
claim
i
thankfully
accepted
this
offer
and
went
with
him
accordingly
i
found
that
hemmings
had
been
with
mrs
maurice
in
the
course
of
the
day
had
received
from
her
intelligence
of
this
transaction
and
had
entertained
the
expectation
of
a
visit
from
me
for
this
very
purpose
while
williams
explained
to
him
the
nature
of
my
claim
he
scanned
me
with
great
intentness
his
austere
and
inflexible
brow
afforded
me
little
room
to
hope
for
success
and
this
hopelessness
was
confirmed
by
his
silence
and
perplexity
when
williams
had
made
an
end
to-be-sure
said
he
after
some
pause
the
contract
was
explicit
to-be-sure
the
conditions
on
mr
mervyn's
side
have
been
performed
certain
it
is
the
bills
are
entire
and
complete
but
mrs
maurice
will
not
consent
to
do
her
part
and
mrs
maurice
to
whom
the
papers
were
presented
is
the
person
by
whom
according
to
the
terms
of
the
contract
the
reward
must
be
paid
but
mrs
maurice
you
know
sir
may
be
legally
compelled
to
pay
said
williams
perhaps
she
may
but
i
tell
you
plainly
that
she
never
will
do
the
thing
without
compulsion
legal
process
however
in
this
case
will
have
other
inconveniences
besides
delay
some
curiosity
will
naturally
be
excited
as
to
the
history
of
these
papers
watson
disappeared
a
twelvemonth
ago
who
can
avoid
asking
where
have
these
papers
been
deposited
all
this
while
and
how
came
this
person
in
possession
of
them
that
kind
of
curiosity
said
i
is
natural
and
laudable
and
gladly
would
i
gratify
it
disclosure
or
concealment
in
that
case
however
would
nowise
affect
my
present
claim
whether
a
bond
legally
executed
shall
be
paid
does
not
depend
upon
determining
whether
the
payer
is
fondest
of
boiled
mutton
or
roast
beef
truth
in
the
first
case
has
no
connection
with
truth
in
the
second
so
far
from
eluding
this
curiosity
so
far
from
studying
concealment
i
am
anxious
to
publish
the
truth
you
are
right
to-be-sure
said
hemmings
curiosity
is
a
natural
but
only
an
incidental
consequence
in
this
case
i
have
no
reason
for
desiring
that
it
should
be
an
unpleasant
consequence
to
you
well
sir
said
williams
you
think
that
arthur
mervyn
has
no
remedy
in
this
case
but
the
law
mrs
maurice
to-be-sure
will
never
pay
but
on
compulsion
mervyn
should
have
known
his
own
interest
better
while
his
left
hand
was
stretched
out
to
give
his
right
should
have
been
held
forth
to
receive
as
it
is
he
must
be
contented
with
the
aid
of
law
any
attorney
will
prosecute
on
condition
of
receiving
half
the
sum
when
recovered
we
now
rose
to
take
our
leave
when
hemmings
desiring
us
to
pause
a
moment
said
to-be-sure
in
the
utmost
strictness
of
the
terms
of
our
promise
the
reward
was
to
be
paid
by
the
person
who
received
the
papers
but
it
must
be
owned
that
your
claim
at
any
rate
is
equitable
i
have
money
of
the
deceased
mr
maurice
in
my
hands
these
very
bills
are
now
in
my
possession
i
will
therefore
pay
you
your
due
and
take
the
consequences
of
an
act
of
justice
on
myself
i
was
prepared
for
you
sign
that
receipt
and
there
is
a
check
for
the
amount
this
unexpected
and
agreeable
decision
was
accompanied
by
an
invitation
to
supper
at
which
we
were
treated
by
our
host
with
much
affability
and
kindness
finding
me
the
author
of
williams's
good
fortune
as
well
as
mrs
maurice's
and
being
assured
by
the
former
of
his
entire
conviction
of
the
rectitude
of
my
conduct
he
laid
aside
all
reserve
and
distance
with
regard
to
me
he
inquired
into
my
prospects
and
wishes
and
professed
his
willingness
to
serve
me
i
dealt
with
equal
unreserve
and
frankness
i
am
poor
said
i
money
for
my
very
expenses
hither
i
have
borrowed
from
a
friend
to
whom
i
am
in
other
respects
much
indebted
and
whom
i
expect
to
compensate
only
by
gratitude
and
future
services
in
coming
hither
i
expected
only
an
increase
of
my
debts
to
sink
still
deeper
into
poverty
but
happily
the
issue
has
made
me
rich
this
hour
has
given
me
competence
at
least
what
call
you
a
thousand
dollars
competence
more
than
competence
i
call
it
an
abundance
my
own
ingenuity
while
i
enjoy
health
will
enable
me
to
live
this
i
regard
as
a
fund
first
to
pay
my
debts
and
next
to
supply
deficiencies
occasioned
by
untoward
accidents
or
ill
health
during
the
ensuing
three
or
four
years
at
least
we
parted
with
this
new
acquaintance
at
a
late
hour
and
i
accepted
williams's
invitation
to
pass
the
time
i
should
spend
at
baltimore
under
his
sister's
roof
there
were
several
motives
for
prolonging
this
stay
what
i
had
heard
of
miss
fanny
maurice
excited
strong
wishes
to
be
personally
acquainted
with
her
this
young
lady
was
affectionately
attached
to
mrs
watson
by
whose
means
my
wishes
were
easily
accomplished
i
never
was
in
habits
of
reserve
even
with
those
whom
i
had
no
reason
to
esteem
with
those
who
claimed
my
admiration
and
affection
it
was
impossible
to
be
incommunicative
before
the
end
of
my
second
interview
both
these
women
were
mistresses
of
every
momentous
incident
of
my
life
and
of
the
whole
chain
of
my
feelings
and
opinions
in
relation
to
every
subject
and
particularly
in
relation
to
themselves
every
topic
disconnected
with
these
is
comparatively
lifeless
and
inert
i
found
it
easy
to
win
their
attention
and
to
render
them
communicative
in
their
turn
as
full
disclosures
as
i
had
made
without
condition
or
request
my
inquiries
and
example
easily
obtained
from
mrs
watson
and
miss
maurice
the
former
related
every
event
of
her
youth
and
the
circumstances
leading
to
her
marriage
she
depicted
the
character
of
her
husband
and
the
whole
train
of
suspenses
and
inquietudes
occasioned
by
his
disappearance
the
latter
did
not
hide
from
me
her
opinions
upon
any
important
subject
and
made
me
thoroughly
acquainted
with
her
actual
situation
this
intercourse
was
strangely
fascinating
my
heart
was
buoyed
up
by
a
kind
of
intoxication
i
now
found
myself
exalted
to
my
genial
element
and
began
to
taste
the
delights
of
existence
in
the
intercourse
of
ingenuous
and
sympathetic
minds
i
found
a
pleasure
which
i
had
not
previously
conceived
the
time
flew
swiftly
away
and
a
fortnight
passed
almost
before
i
was
aware
that
a
day
had
gone
by
i
did
not
forget
the
friends
whom
i
had
left
behind
but
maintained
a
punctual
correspondence
with
stevens
to
whom
i
imparted
all
occurrences
the
recovery
of
my
friend's
kinsman
allowed
him
in
a
few
days
to
return
home
his
first
object
was
the
consolation
and
relief
of
carlton
whom
with
much
difficulty
he
persuaded
to
take
advantage
of
the
laws
in
favour
of
insolvent
debtors
carlton's
only
debt
was
owing
to
his
uncle
and
by
rendering
up
every
species
of
property
except
his
clothes
and
the
implements
of
his
trade
he
obtained
a
full
discharge
in
conjunction
with
his
sister
he
once
more
assumed
the
pen
and
being
no
longer
burdened
with
debts
he
was
unable
to
discharge
he
resumed
together
with
his
pen
his
cheerfulness
their
mutual
industry
was
sufficient
for
their
decent
and
moderate
subsistence
the
chief
reason
for
my
hasty
return
was
my
anxiety
respecting
clemenza
lodi
this
reason
was
removed
by
the
activity
and
benevolence
of
my
friend
he
paid
this
unfortunate
stranger
a
visit
at
mrs
villars's
access
was
easily
obtained
and
he
found
her
sunk
into
the
deepest
melancholy
the
recent
loss
of
her
child
the
death
of
welbeck
of
which
she
was
soon
apprized
her
total
dependence
upon
those
with
whom
she
was
placed
who
however
had
always
treated
her
without
barbarity
or
indecorum
were
the
calamities
that
weighed
down
her
spirits
my
friend
easily
engaged
her
confidence
and
gratitude
and
prevailed
upon
her
to
take
refuge
under
his
own
roof
mrs
wentworth's
scruples
as
well
as
those
of
mrs
fielding
were
removed
by
his
arguments
and
entreaties
and
they
consented
to
take
upon
themselves
and
divide
between
them
the
care
of
her
subsistence
and
happiness
they
condescended
to
express
much
curiosity
respecting
me
and
some
interest
in
my
welfare
and
promised
to
receive
me
on
my
return
on
the
footing
of
a
friend
with
some
reluctance
i
at
length
bade
my
new
friends
farewell
and
returned
to
philadelphia
nothing
remained
before
i
should
enter
on
my
projected
scheme
of
study
and
employment
under
the
guidance
of
stevens
but
to
examine
the
situation
of
eliza
hadwin
with
my
own
eyes
and
if
possible
to
extricate
my
father
from
his
unfortunate
situation
my
father's
state
had
given
me
the
deepest
concern
i
figured
to
myself
his
condition
besotted
by
brutal
appetites
reduced
to
beggary
shut
up
in
a
noisome
prison
and
condemned
to
that
society
which
must
foster
all
his
depraved
propensities
i
revolved
various
schemes
for
his
relief
a
few
hundreds
would
take
him
from
prison
but
how
should
he
be
afterwards
disposed
of
how
should
he
be
cured
of
his
indolent
habits
how
should
he
be
screened
from
the
contagion
of
vicious
society
by
what
means
consistently
with
my
own
wants
and
the
claims
of
others
should
i
secure
to
him
an
acceptable
subsistence
exhortation
and
example
were
vain
nothing
but
restraint
would
keep
him
at
a
distance
from
the
haunts
of
brawling
and
debauchery
the
want
of
money
would
be
no
obstacle
to
prodigality
and
waste
credit
would
be
resorted
to
as
long
as
it
would
answer
his
demand
when
that
failed
he
would
once
more
be
thrown
into
a
prison
the
same
means
to
extricate
him
would
have
to
be
repeated
and
money
be
thus
put
into
the
pockets
of
the
most
worthless
of
mankind
the
agents
of
drunkenness
and
blasphemy
without
any
permanent
advantage
to
my
father
the
principal
object
of
my
charity
though
unable
to
fix
on
any
plausible
mode
of
proceeding
i
determined
at
least
to
discover
his
present
condition
perhaps
something
might
suggest
itself
upon
the
spot
suited
to
my
purpose
without
delay
i
proceeded
to
the
village
of
newtown
and
alighting
at
the
door
of
the
prison
inquired
for
my
father
sawny
mervyn
you
want
i
suppose
said
the
keeper
poor
fellow
he
came
into
limbo
in
a
crazy
condition
and
has
been
a
burden
on
my
hands
ever
since
after
lingering
along
for
some
time
he
was
at
last
kind
enough
to
give
us
the
slip
it
is
just
a
week
since
he
drank
his
last
pint--and
died
i
was
greatly
shocked
at
this
intelligence
it
was
some
time
before
my
reason
came
to
my
aid
and
showed
me
that
this
was
an
event
on
the
whole
and
on
a
disinterested
and
dispassionate
view
not
unfortunate
the
keeper
knew
not
my
relation
to
the
deceased
and
readily
recounted
the
behaviour
of
the
prisoner
and
the
circumstances
of
his
last
hours
i
shall
not
repeat
the
narrative
it
is
useless
to
keep
alive
the
sad
remembrance
he
was
now
beyond
the
reach
of
my
charity
or
pity
and
since
reflection
could
answer
no
beneficial
end
to
him
it
was
my
duty
to
divert
my
thoughts
into
different
channels
and
live
henceforth
for
my
own
happiness
and
that
of
those
who
were
within
the
sphere
of
my
influence
i
was
now
alone
in
the
world
so
far
as
the
total
want
of
kindred
creates
solitude
not
one
of
my
blood
nor
even
of
my
name
was
to
be
found
in
this
quarter
of
the
world
of
my
mother's
kindred
i
knew
nothing
so
far
as
friendship
or
service
might
be
claimed
from
them
to
me
they
had
no
existence
i
was
destitute
of
all
those
benefits
which
flow
from
kindred
in
relation
to
protection
advice
or
property
my
inheritance
was
nothing
not
a
single
relic
or
trinket
in
my
possession
constituted
a
memorial
of
my
family
the
scenes
of
my
childish
and
juvenile
days
were
dreary
and
desolate
the
fields
which
i
was
wont
to
traverse
the
room
in
which
i
was
born
retained
no
traces
of
the
past
they
were
the
property
and
residence
of
strangers
who
knew
nothing
of
the
former
tenants
and
who
as
i
was
now
told
had
hastened
to
new-model
and
transform
every
thing
within
and
without
the
habitation
these
images
filled
me
with
melancholy
which
however
disappeared
in
proportion
as
i
approached
the
abode
of
my
beloved
girl
absence
had
endeared
the
image
of
my
bess--i
loved
to
call
her
so--to
my
soul
i
could
not
think
of
her
without
a
melting
softness
at
my
heart
and
tears
in
which
pain
and
pleasure
were
unaccountably
mingled
as
i
approached
curling's
house
i
strained
my
sight
in
hopes
of
distinguishing
her
form
through
the
evening
dusk
i
had
told
her
of
my
purpose
by
letter
she
expected
my
approach
at
this
hour
and
was
stationed
with
a
heart
throbbing
with
impatience
at
the
roadside
near
the
gate
as
soon
as
i
alighted
she
rushed
into
my
arms
i
found
my
sweet
friend
less
blithesome
and
contented
than
i
wished
her
situation
in
spite
of
the
parental
and
sisterly
regards
which
she
received
from
the
curlings
was
mournful
and
dreary
to
her
imagination
rural
business
was
irksome
and
insufficient
to
fill
up
her
time
her
life
was
tiresome
and
uniform
and
heavy
i
ventured
to
blame
her
discontent
and
pointed
out
the
advantages
of
her
situation
whence
said
i
can
these
dissatisfactions
and
repinings
arise
i
cannot
tell
said
she
i
don't
know
how
it
is
with
me
i
am
always
sorrowful
and
thoughtful
perhaps
i
think
too
much
of
my
poor
father
and
of
susan
and
yet
that
can't
be
it
neither
for
i
think
of
them
but
seldom
not
half
as
much
as
i
ought
perhaps
i
think
of
nobody
almost
but
you
instead
of
minding
my
business
or
chatting
and
laughing
with
peggy
curling
i
love
to
get
by
myself--to
read
over
and
over
your
letters
or
to
think
how
you
are
employed
just
then
and
how
happy
i
should
be
if
i
were
in
fanny
maurice's
place
but
it
is
all
over
now
this
visit
rewards
me
for
every
thing
i
wonder
how
i
could
ever
be
sullen
or
mopeful
i
will
behave
better
indeed
i
will
and
be
always
as
now
a
most
happy
girl
the
greater
part
of
three
days
was
spent
in
the
society
of
my
friend
in
listening
to
her
relation
of
all
that
had
happened
during
my
absence
and
in
communicating
in
my
turn
every
incident
which
had
befallen
myself
after
this
i
once
more
returned
to
the
city
i
now
set
about
carrying
my
plan
of
life
into
effect
i
began
with
ardent
zeal
and
unwearied
diligence
the
career
of
medical
study
i
bespoke
the
counsels
and
instructions
of
my
friend
attended
him
on
his
professional
visits
and
acted
in
all
practicable
cases
as
his
substitute
i
found
this
application
of
time
more
pleasurable
than
i
had
imagined
my
mind
gladly
expanded
itself
as
it
were
for
the
reception
of
new
ideas
my
curiosity
grew
more
eager
in
proportion
as
it
was
supplied
with
food
and
every
day
added
strength
to
the
assurance
that
i
was
no
insignificant
and
worthless
being
that
i
was
destined
to
be
something
in
this
scene
of
existence
and
might
some
time
lay
claim
to
the
gratitude
and
homage
of
my
fellow
men
i
was
far
from
being
however
monopolized
by
these
pursuits
i
was
formed
on
purpose
for
the
gratification
of
social
intercourse
to
love
and
to
be
loved
to
exchange
hearts
and
mingle
sentiments
with
all
the
virtuous
and
amiable
whom
my
good
fortune
had
placed
within
the
circuit
of
my
knowledge
i
always
esteemed
my
highest
enjoyment
and
my
chief
duty
carlton
and
his
sister
mrs
wentworth
and
achsa
fielding
were
my
most
valuable
associates
beyond
my
own
family
with
all
these
my
correspondence
was
frequent
and
unreserved
but
chiefly
with
the
latter
this
lady
had
dignity
and
independence
a
generous
and
enlightened
spirit
beyond
what
her
education
had
taught
me
to
expect
she
was
circumspect
and
cautious
in
her
deportment
and
was
not
prompt
to
make
advances
or
accept
them
she
withheld
her
esteem
and
confidence
until
she
had
full
proof
of
their
being
deserved
i
am
not
sure
that
her
treatment
of
me
was
fully
conformable
to
her
rules
my
manners
indeed
as
she
once
told
me
she
had
never
met
with
in
another
ordinary
rules
were
so
totally
overlooked
in
my
behaviour
that
it
seemed
impossible
for
any
one
who
knew
me
to
adhere
to
them
no
option
was
left
but
to
admit
my
claims
to
friendship
and
confidence
instantly
or
to
reject
them
altogether
i
was
not
conscious
of
this
singularity
the
internal
and
undiscovered
character
of
another
weighed
nothing
with
me
in
the
question
whether
they
should
be
treated
with
frankness
or
reserve
i
felt
no
scruple
on
any
occasion
to
disclose
every
feeling
and
every
event
any
one
who
could
listen
found
me
willing
to
talk
every
talker
found
me
willing
to
listen
every
one
had
my
sympathy
and
kindness
without
claiming
it
but
i
claimed
the
kindness
and
sympathy
of
every
one
achsa
fielding's
countenance
bespoke
i
thought
a
mind
worthy
to
be
known
and
to
be
loved
the
first
moment
i
engaged
her
attention
i
told
her
so
i
related
the
little
story
of
my
family
spread
out
before
her
all
my
reasonings
and
determinations
my
notions
of
right
and
wrong
my
fears
and
wishes
all
this
was
done
with
sincerity
and
fervour
with
gestures
actions
and
looks
in
which
i
felt
as
if
my
whole
soul
was
visible
her
superior
age
sedateness
and
prudence
gave
my
deportment
a
filial
freedom
and
affection
and
i
was
fond
of
calling
her
mamma
i
particularly
dwelt
upon
the
history
of
my
dear
country-girl
painted
her
form
and
countenance
recounted
our
dialogues
and
related
all
my
schemes
for
making
her
wise
and
good
and
happy
on
these
occasions
my
friend
would
listen
to
me
with
the
mutest
attention
i
showed
her
the
letters
i
received
and
offered
her
for
her
perusal
those
which
i
wrote
in
answer
before
they
were
sealed
and
sent
on
these
occasions
she
would
look
by
turns
on
my
face
and
away
from
me
a
varying
hue
would
play
upon
her
cheek
and
her
eyes
were
fuller
than
was
common
of
meaning
such-and-such
i
once
said
are
my
notions
now
what
do
you
think
think
emphatically
and
turning
somewhat
aside
she
answered
that
you
are
the
most--strange
of
human
creatures
but
tell
me
i
resumed
following
and
searching
her
averted
eyes
am
i
right
would
you
do
thus
can
you
help
me
to
improve
my
girl
i
wish
you
knew
the
bewitching
little
creature
how
would
that
heart
overflow
with
affection
and
with
gratitude
towards
you
she
should
be
your
daughter
no--you
are
too
nearly
of
an
age
for
that
a
sister
her
elder
sister
you
should
be
that
when
there
is
no
other
relation
includes
them
all
fond
sisters
you
would
be
and
i
the
fond
brother
of
you
both
my
eyes
glistened
as
i
spoke
in
truth
i
am
in
that
respect
a
mere
woman
my
friend
was
more
powerfully
moved
after
a
momentary
struggle
she
burst
into
tears
good
heaven
said
i
what
ails
you
are
you
not
well
her
looks
betrayed
an
unaccountable
confusion
from
which
she
quickly
recovered--it
was
folly
to
be
thus
affected
something
ailed
me
i
believe
but
it
is
past
but
come
you
want
some
lines
of
finishing
the
description
of
the
boa
in
la
cepide
true
and
i
have
twenty
minutes
to
spare
poor
franks
is
very
ill
indeed
but
he
cannot
be
seen
till
nine
we'll
read
till
then
thus
on
the
wings
of
pleasure
and
improvement
passed
my
time
not
without
some
hues
occasionally
of
a
darker
tint
my
heart
was
now
and
then
detected
in
sighing
this
occurred
when
my
thoughts
glanced
at
the
poor
eliza
and
measured
as
it
were
the
interval
between
us
we
are
too--too
far
apart
thought
i
the
best
solace
on
these
occasions
was
the
company
of
mrs
fielding
her
music
her
discourse
or
some
book
which
she
set
me
to
rehearsing
to
her
one
evening
when
preparing
to
pay
her
a
visit
i
received
the
following
letter
from
my
bess--
to
a
mervyn
curling's
may
6
1794
where
does
this
letter
you
promised
me
stay
all
this
while
indeed
arthur
you
torment
me
more
than
i
deserve
and
more
than
i
could
ever
find
it
in
my
heart
to
do
you
you
treat
me
cruelly
i
must
say
so
though
i
offend
you
i
must
write
though
you
do
not
deserve
that
i
should
and
though
i
fear
i
am
in
a
humour
not
very
fit
for
writing
i
had
better
go
to
my
chamber
and
weep
weep
at
your--unkindness
i
was
going
to
say
but
perhaps
it
is
only
forgetfulness
and
yet
what
can
be
more
unkind
than
forgetfulness
i
am
sure
i
have
never
forgotten
you
sleep
itself
which
wraps
all
other
images
in
forgetfulness
only
brings
you
nearer
and
makes
me
see
you
more
distinctly
but
where
can
this
letter
stay--oh
that--hush
foolish
girl
if
a
word
of
that
kind
escape
thy
lips
arthur
will
be
angry
with
thee
and
then
indeed
thou
mightest
weep
in
earnest
then
thou
wouldst
have
some
cause
for
thy
tears
more
than
once
already
has
he
almost
broken
thy
heart
with
his
reproaches
sore
and
weak
as
it
now
is
any
new
reproaches
would
assuredly
break
it
quite
i
will
be
content
i
will
be
as
good
a
housewife
and
dairywoman
stir
about
as
briskly
and
sing
as
merrily
as
peggy
curling
why
not
i
am
as
young
as
innocent
and
enjoy
as
good
health
alas
she
has
reason
to
be
merry
she
has
father
mother
brothers
but
i
have
none
and
he
that
was
all
these
and
more
than
all
these
to
me
has--forgotten
me
but
perhaps
it
is
some
accident
that
hinders
perhaps
oliver
left
the
market
earlier
than
he
used
to
do
or
you
mistook
the
house
or
perhaps
some
poor
creature
was
sick
was
taken
suddenly
ill
and
you
were
busy
in
chafing
his
clay-cold
limbs
it
fell
to
you
to
wipe
the
clammy
drops
from
his
brow
such
things
often
happen
don't
they
arthur
to
people
of
your
trade
and
some
such
thing
has
happened
now
and
that
was
the
reason
you
did
not
write
and
if
so
shall
i
repine
at
your
silence
oh
no
at
such
a
time
the
poor
bess
might
easily
be
and
ought
to
be
forgotten
she
would
not
deserve
your
love
if
she
could
repine
at
a
silence
brought
about
this
way
and
oh
may
it
be
so
may
there
be
nothing
worse
than
this
if
the
sick
man--see
arthur
how
my
hand
trembles
can
you
read
this
scrawl
what
is
always
bad
my
fears
make
worse
than
ever
i
must
not
think
that
and
yet
if
it
be
so
if
my
friend
himself
be
sick
what
will
become
of
me
of
me
that
ought
to
cherish
you
and
comfort
you
that
ought
to
be
your
nurse
endure
for
you
your
sickness
when
she
cannot
remove
it
oh
that----i
will
speak
out--oh
that
this
strange
scruple
had
never
possessed
you
why
should
i
not
be
with
you
who
can
love
you
and
serve
you
as
well
as
i
in
sickness
and
health
i
will
console
and
assist
you
why
will
you
deprive
yourself
of
such
a
comforter
and
such
an
aid
as
i
would
be
to
you
dear
arthur
think
better
of
it
let
me
leave
this
dreary
spot
where
indeed
as
long
as
i
am
thus
alone
i
can
enjoy
no
comfort
let
me
come
to
you
i
will
put
up
with
any
thing
for
the
sake
of
seeing
you
though
it
be
but
once
a
day
any
garret
or
cellar
in
the
dirtiest
lane
or
darkest
alley
will
be
good
enough
for
me
i
will
think
it
a
palace
so
that
i
can
but
see
you
now
and
then
do
not
refuse--do
not
argue
with
me
so
fond
you
always
are
of
arguing
my
heart
is
set
upon
your
compliance
and
yet
dearly
as
i
prize
your
company
i
would
not
ask
it
if
i
thought
there
was
any
thing
improper
you
say
there
is
and
you
talk
about
it
in
a
way
that
i
do
not
understand
for
my
sake
you
tell
me
you
refuse
but
let
me
entreat
you
to
comply
for
my
sake
your
pen
cannot
teach
me
like
your
tongue
you
write
me
long
letters
and
tell
me
a
great
deal
in
them
but
my
soul
droops
when
i
call
to
mind
your
voice
and
your
looks
and
think
how
long
a
time
must
pass
before
i
see
you
and
hear
you
again
i
have
no
spirit
to
think
upon
the
words
and
paper
before
me
my
eye
and
my
thought
wander
far
away
i
bethink
me
how
many
questions
i
might
ask
you
how
many
doubts
you
might
clear
up
if
you
were
but
within
hearing
if
you
were
but
close
to
me
but
i
cannot
ask
them
here
i
am
too
poor
a
creature
at
the
pen
and
somehow
or
another
it
always
happens
i
can
only
write
about
myself
or
about
you
by
the
time
i
have
said
all
this
i
have
tired
my
fingers
and
when
i
set
about
telling
you
how
this
poem
and
that
story
have
affected
me
i
am
at
a
loss
for
words
i
am
bewildered
and
bemazed
as
it
were
it
is
not
so
when
we
talk
to
one
another
with
your
arm
about
me
and
your
sweet
face
close
to
mine
i
can
prattle
forever
then
my
heart
overflows
at
my
lips
after
hours
thus
spent
it
seems
as
if
there
were
a
thousand
things
still
to
be
said
then
i
can
tell
you
what
the
book
has
told
me
i
can
repeat
scores
of
verses
by
heart
though
i
heard
them
only
once
read
but
it
is
because
you
have
read
them
to
me
then
there
is
nobody
here
to
answer
my
questions
they
never
look
into
books
they
hate
books
they
think
it
waste
of
time
to
read
even
peggy
who
you
say
has
naturally
a
strong
mind
wonders
what
i
can
find
to
amuse
myself
in
a
book
in
her
playful
mood
she
is
always
teasing
me
to
lay
it
aside
i
do
not
mind
her
for
i
like
to
read
but
if
i
did
not
like
it
before
i
could
not
help
doing
so
ever
since
you
told
me
that
nobody
could
gain
your
love
who
was
not
fond
of
books
and
yet
though
i
like
it
on
that
account
more
than
i
did
i
don't
read
somehow
so
earnestly
and
understand
so
well
as
i
used
to
do
when
my
mind
was
all
at
ease
always
frolicsome
and
ever
upon
tiptoe
as
i
may
say
how
strangely
have
you
not
observed
it
i
am
altered
of
late--i
that
was
ever
light
of
heart
the
very
soul
of
gayety
brimfull
of
glee
am
now
demure
as
our
old
tabby--and
not
half
as
wise
tabby
had
wit
enough
to
keep
her
paws
out
of
the
coals
whereas
poor
i
have--but
no
matter
what
it
will
never
come
to
pass
i
see
that
so
many
reasons
for
every
thing
such
looking
forward
arthur
are
not
men
sometimes
too
wise
to
be
happy
i
am
now
so
grave
not
one
smile
can
peggy
sometimes
get
from
me
though
she
tries
for
it
the
whole
day
but
i
know
how
it
comes
strange
indeed
if
losing
father
and
sister
and
thrown
upon
the
wide
world
penniless
and
friendless
too
now
that
you
forget
me
i
should
continue
to
smile
no
i
never
shall
smile
again
at
least
while
i
stay
here
i
never
shall
i
believe
if
a
certain
somebody
suffer
me
to
live
with
him--near
him
i
mean--perhaps
the
sight
of
him
as
he
enters
the
door
perhaps
the
sound
of
his
voice
asking
where
is
my
bess
might
produce
a
smile
such
a
one
as
the
very
thought
produces
now--yet
not
i
hope
so
transient
and
so
quickly
followed
by
a
tear
women
are
born
they
say
to
trouble
and
tears
are
given
them
for
their
relief
'tis
all
very
true
let
it
be
as
i
wish
will
you
if
oliver
bring
not
back
good
tidings
if
he
bring
not
a
letter
from
thee
or
thy
letter
still
refuses
my
request--i
don't
know
what
may
happen
consent
if
you
love
your
poor
girl
eh
the
reading
of
this
letter
though
it
made
me
mournful
did
not
hinder
me
from
paying
the
visit
i
intended
my
friend
noticed
my
discomposure
what
arthur
thou
art
quite
the
'penseroso'
to-night
come
let
me
cheer
thee
with
a
song
thou
shalt
have
thy
favourite
ditty
she
stepped
to
the
instrument
and
with
more
than
airy
lightness
touched
and
sung--
now
knit
hands
and
beat
the
ground
in
a
light
fantastic
round
till
the
telltale
sun
descry
our
conceal'd
solemnity
her
music
though
blithsome
and
aerial
was
not
sufficient
for
the
end
my
cheerfulness
would
not
return
even
at
her
bidding
she
again
noticed
my
sedateness
and
inquired
into
the
cause
this
girl
of
mine
said
i
has
infected
me
with
her
own
sadness
there
is
a
letter
i
have
just
received
she
took
it
and
began
to
read
meanwhile
i
placed
myself
before
her
and
fixed
my
eyes
steadfastly
upon
her
features
there
is
no
book
in
which
i
read
with
more
pleasure
than
the
face
of
woman
that
is
generally
more
full
of
meaning
and
of
better
meaning
too
than
the
hard
and
inflexible
lineaments
of
man
and
this
woman's
face
has
no
parallel
she
read
it
with
visible
emotion
having
gone
through
it
she
did
not
lift
her
eye
from
the
paper
but
continued
silent
as
if
buried
in
thought
after
some
time
for
i
would
not
interrupt
the
pause
she
addressed
me
thus--
this
girl
seems
to
be
very
anxious
to
be
with
you
as
much
as
i
am
that
she
should
be
so
my
friend's
countenance
betrayed
some
perplexity
as
soon
as
i
perceived
it
i
said
why
are
you
thus
grave
some
little
confusion
appeared
as
if
she
would
not
have
her
gravity
discovered
there
again
said
i
new
tokens
in
your
face
my
good
mamma
of
something
which
you
will
not
mention
yet
sooth
to
say
this
is
not
your
first
perplexity
i
have
noticed
it
before
and
wondered
it
happens
only
when
my
bess
is
introduced
something
in
relation
to
her
it
must
be
but
what
i
cannot
imagine
why
does
her
name
particularly
make
you
thoughtful
disturbed
dejected
there
now--but
i
must
know
the
reason
you
don't
agree
with
me
in
my
notions
of
this
girl
i
fear
and
you
will
not
disclose
your
thoughts
by
this
time
she
had
gained
her
usual
composure
and
without
noticing
my
comments
on
her
looks
said
since
you
are
both
of
one
mind
why
does
she
not
leave
the
country
that
cannot
be
i
believe
mrs
stevens
says
it
would
be
disreputable
i
am
no
proficient
in
etiquette
and
must
therefore
in
affairs
of
this
kind
be
guided
by
those
who
are
but
would
to
heaven
i
were
truly
her
father
or
brother
then
all
difficulties
would
be
done
away
can
you
seriously
wish
that
why
no
i
believe
it
would
be
more
rational
to
wish
that
the
world
would
suffer
me
to
act
the
fatherly
or
brotherly
part
without
the
relationship
and
is
that
the
only
part
you
wish
to
act
towards
this
girl
certainly
the
only
part
you
surprise
me
have
you
not
confessed
your
love
for
her
i
do
love
her
there
is
nothing
upon
earth
more
dear
to
me
than
my
bess
but
love
is
of
different
kinds
she
was
loved
by
her
father----
less
than
by
me
he
was
a
good
man
but
not
of
lively
feelings
besides
he
had
another
daughter
and
they
shared
his
love
between
them
but
she
has
no
sister
to
share
my
love
calamity
too
has
endeared
her
to
me
i
am
all
her
consolation
dependence
and
hope
and
nothing
surely
can
induce
me
to
abandon
her
her
reliance
upon
you
for
happiness
replied
my
friend
with
a
sigh
is
plain
enough
it
is
but
why
that
sigh
and
yet
i
understand
it
it
remonstrates
with
me
on
my
incapacity
for
her
support
i
know
it
well
but
it
is
wrong
to
be
cast
down
i
have
youth
health
and
spirits
and
ought
not
to
despair
of
living
for
my
own
benefit
and
hers
but
you
sigh
again
and
it
is
impossible
to
keep
my
courage
when
you
sigh
do
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
it
you
partly
guessed
the
cause
she
trusts
to
you
for
happiness
but
i
somewhat
suspect
she
trusts
in
vain
in
vain
i
beseech
you
tell
me
why
you
think
so
you
say
you
love
her
why
then
not
make
her
your
wife
my
wife
surely
her
extreme
youth
and
my
destitute
condition
will
account
for
that
she
is
fifteen
the
age
of
delicate
fervour
of
inartificial
love
and
suitable
enough
for
marriage
as
to
your
condition
you
may
live
more
easily
together
than
apart
she
has
no
false
taste
or
perverse
desires
to
gratify
she
has
been
trained
in
simple
modes
and
habits
besides
that
objection
can
be
removed
another
way
but
are
these
all
your
objections
her
youth
i
object
to
merely
in
connection
with
her
mind
she
is
too
little
improved
to
be
my
wife
she
wants
that
solidity
of
mind
that
maturity
of
intelligence
which
ten
years
more
may
possibly
give
her
but
which
she
cannot
have
at
this
age
you
are
a
very
prudential
youth
then
you
are
willing
to
wait
ten
years
for
a
wife
does
that
follow
because
my
bess
will
not
be
qualified
for
wedlock
in
less
time
does
it
follow
that
i
must
wait
for
her
i
spoke
on
the
supposition
that
you
loved
her
and
that
is
true
but
love
is
satisfied
with
studying
her
happiness
as
her
father
or
brother
some
years
hence
perhaps
in
half
a
year
for
this
passion
called
wedded
or
marriage-wishing
love
is
of
sudden
growth
my
mind
may
change
and
nothing
may
content
me
but
to
have
bess
for
my
wife
yet
i
do
not
expect
it
then
you
are
determined
against
marriage
with
this
girl
of
course
until
that
love
comes
which
i
feel
not
now
but
which
no
doubt
will
come
when
bess
has
had
the
benefit
of
five
or
eight
years
more
unless
previously
excited
by
another
all
this
is
strange
arthur
i
have
heretofore
supposed
that
you
actually
loved
i
mean
with
the
marriage-seeking
passion
your
bess
i
believe
i
once
did
but
it
happened
at
a
time
when
marriage
was
improper
in
the
life
of
her
father
and
sister
and
when
i
had
never
known
in
what
female
excellence
consisted
since
that
time
my
happier
lot
has
cast
me
among
women
so
far
above
eliza
hadwin--so
far
above
and
so
widely
different
from
any
thing
which
time
is
likely
to
make
her--that
i
own
nothing
appears
more
unlikely
than
that
i
shall
ever
love
her
are
you
not
a
little
capricious
in
that
respect
my
good
friend
you
have
praised
your
bess
as
rich
in
natural
endowments
as
having
an
artless
purity
and
rectitude
of
mind
which
somewhat
supersedes
the
use
of
formal
education
as
being
full
of
sweetness
and
tenderness
and
in
her
person
a
very
angel
of
loveliness
all
that
is
true
i
never
saw
features
and
shape
so
delicately
beautiful
i
never
knew
so
young
a
mind
so
quick-sighted
and
so
firm
but
nevertheless
she
is
not
the
creature
whom
i
would
call
my
wife
my
bosom-slave
counsellor
friend
the
mother
the
pattern
the
tutoress
of
my
children
must
be
a
different
creature
but
what
are
the
attributes
of
this
desirable
which
bess
wants
every
thing
she
wants
age
capacity
acquirements
person
features
hair
complexion
all
all
are
different
from
this
girl's
and
pray
of
what
kind
may
they
be
i
cannot
portray
them
in
words--but
yes
i
can--the
creature
whom
i
shall
worship--it
sounds
oddly
but
i
verily
believe
the
sentiment
which
i
shall
feel
for
my
wife
will
be
more
akin
to
worship
than
any
thing
else
i
shall
never
love
but
such
a
creature
as
i
now
image
to
myself
and
such
a
creature
will
deserve
or
almost
deserve
worship
but
this
creature
i
was
going
to
say
must
be
the
exact
counterpart
my
good
mamma--of
yourself
this
was
said
very
earnestly
and
with
eyes
and
manner
that
fully
expressed
my
earnestness
perhaps
my
expressions
were
unwittingly
strong
and
emphatic
for
she
started
and
blushed
but
the
cause
of
her
discomposure
whatever
it
was
was
quickly
removed
and
she
said--
poor
bess
this
will
be
sad
news
to
thee
heaven
forbid
said
i
of
what
moment
can
my
opinions
be
to
her
strange
questioner
that
thou
art
thou
knowest
that
her
gentle
heart
is
touched
with
love
see
how
it
shows
itself
in
the
tender
and
inimitable
strain
of
this
epistle
does
not
this
sweet
ingenuousness
bewitch
you
it
does
so
and
i
love
beyond
expression
the
sweet
girl
but
my
love
is
in
some
inconceivable
way
different
from
the
passion
which
that
other
creature
will
produce
she
is
no
stranger
to
my
thoughts
i
will
impart
every
thought
over
and
over
to
her
i
question
not
but
i
shall
make
her
happy
without
forfeiting
my
own
would
marriage
with
her
be
a
forfeiture
of
your
happiness
not
absolutely
or
forever
i
believe
i
love
her
company
her
absence
for
a
long
time
is
irksome
i
cannot
express
the
delight
with
which
i
see
and
hear
her
to
mark
her
features
beaming
with
vivacity
playful
in
her
pleasures
to
hold
her
in
my
arms
and
listen
to
her
prattle
always
musically
voluble
always
sweetly
tender
or
artlessly
intelligent--and
this
you
will
say
is
the
dearest
privilege
of
marriage
and
so
it
is
and
dearly
should
i
prize
it
and
yet
i
fear
my
heart
would
droop
as
often
as
that
other
image
should
occur
to
my
fancy
for
then
you
know
it
would
occur
as
something
never
to
be
possessed
by
me
now
this
image
might
indeed
seldom
occur
the
intervals
at
least
would
be
serene
it
would
be
my
interest
to
prolong
these
intervals
as
much
as
possible
and
my
endeavours
to
this
end
would
no
doubt
have
some
effect
besides
the
bitterness
of
this
reflection
would
be
lessened
by
contemplating
at
the
same
time
the
happiness
of
my
beloved
girl
i
should
likewise
have
to
remember
that
to
continue
unmarried
would
not
necessarily
secure
me
the
possession
of
the
other
good----
but
these
reflections
my
friend
broke
she
in
upon
me
are
of
as
much
force
to
induce
you
to
marry
as
to
reconcile
you
to
a
marriage
already
contracted
perhaps
they
are
assuredly
i
have
not
a
hope
that
the
fancied
excellence
will
ever
be
mine
such
happiness
is
not
the
lot
of
humanity
and
is
least
of
all
within
my
reach
your
diffidence
replied
my
friend
in
a
timorous
accent
has
not
many
examples
but
your
character
without
doubt
is
all
your
own
possessing
all
and
disclaiming
all--is
in
few
words
your
picture
i
scarcely
understand
you
do
you
think
i
ever
shall
be
happy
to
that
degree
which
i
have
imagined
think
you
i
shall
ever
meet
with
an
exact
copy
of
yourself
unfortunate
you
will
be
if
you
do
not
meet
with
many
better
your
bess
in
personals
is
beyond
measure
my
superior
and
in
mind
allowing
for
difference
in
years
quite
as
much
so
but
that
returned
i
with
quickness
and
fervour
is
not
the
object
the
very
counterpart
of
you
i
want
neither
worse
nor
better
nor
different
in
any
thing
just
such
form
such
features
such
hues
just
that
melting
voice
and
above
all
the
same
habits
of
thinking
and
conversing
in
thought
word
and
deed
gesture
look
and
form
that
rare
and
precious
creature
whom
i
shall
love
must
be
your
resemblance
your----
have
done
with
these
comparisons
interrupted
she
in
some
hurry
and
let
us
return
to
the
country-girl
thy
bess
you
once
my
friend
wished
me
to
treat
this
girl
of
yours
as
my
sister
do
you
know
what
the
duties
of
a
sister
are
they
imply
no
more
kindness
or
affection
than
you
already
feel
towards
my
bess
are
you
not
her
sister
i
ought
to
have
been
so
i
ought
to
have
been
proud
of
the
relation
you
ascribe
to
me
but
i
have
not
performed
any
of
its
duties
i
blush
to
think
upon
the
coldness
and
perverseness
of
my
heart
with
such
means
as
i
possess
of
giving
happiness
to
others
i
have
been
thoughtless
and
inactive
to
a
strange
degree
perhaps
however
it
is
not
yet
too
late
are
you
still
willing
to
invest
me
with
all
the
rights
of
an
elder
sister
over
this
girl
and
will
she
consent
think
you
certainly
she
will
she
has
then
the
first
act
of
sistership
will
be
to
take
her
from
the
country
from
persons
on
whose
kindness
she
has
no
natural
claim
whose
manners
and
characters
are
unlike
her
own
and
with
whom
no
improvement
can
be
expected
and
bring
her
back
to
her
sister's
house
and
bosom
to
provide
for
her
subsistence
and
education
and
watch
over
her
happiness
i
will
not
be
a
nominal
sister
i
will
not
be
a
sister
by
halves
all
the
rights
of
that
relation
i
will
have
or
none
as
for
you
you
have
claims
upon
her
on
which
i
must
be
permitted
to
judge
as
becomes
the
elder
sister
who
by
the
loss
of
all
other
relations
must
occupy
the
place
possess
the
rights
and
fulfil
the
duties
of
father
mother
and
brother
she
has
now
arrived
at
an
age
when
longer
to
remain
in
a
cold
and
churlish
soil
will
stunt
her
growth
and
wither
her
blossoms
we
must
hasten
to
transplant
her
to
a
genial
element
and
a
garden
well
enclosed
having
so
long
neglected
this
charming
plant
it
becomes
me
henceforth
to
take
her
wholly
to
myself
and
now
for
it
is
no
longer
in
her
or
your
power
to
take
back
the
gift
since
she
is
fully
mine
i
will
charge
you
with
the
office
of
conducting
her
hither
i
grant
it
you
as
a
favour
will
you
go
go
i
will
fly
i
exclaimed
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
on
pinions
swifter
than
the
wind
not
the
lingering
of
an
instant
will
i
bear
look
one
two
three--thirty
minutes
after
nine
i
will
reach
curling's
gate
by
the
morn's
dawn
i
will
put
my
girl
into
a
chaise
and
by
noon
she
shall
throw
herself
into
the
arms
of
her
sister
but
first
shall
i
not
in
some
way
manifest
my
gratitude
my
senses
were
bewildered
and
i
knew
not
what
i
did
i
intended
to
kneel
as
to
my
mother
or
my
deity
but
instead
of
that
i
clasped
her
in
my
arms
and
kissed
her
lips
fervently
i
stayed
not
to
discover
the
effects
of
this
insanity
but
left
the
room
and
the
house
and
calling
for
a
moment
at
stevens's
left
word
with
the
servant
my
friend
being
gone
abroad
that
i
should
not
return
till
the
morrow
never
was
a
lighter
heart
a
gayety
more
overflowing
and
more
buoyant
than
mine
all
cold
from
a
boisterous
night
at
a
chilly
season
all
weariness
from
a
rugged
and
miry
road
were
charmed
away
i
might
have
ridden
but
i
could
not
brook
delay
even
the
delay
of
inquiring
for
and
equipping
a
horse
i
might
thus
have
saved
myself
fatigue
and
have
lost
no
time
but
my
mind
was
in
too
great
a
tumult
for
deliberation
and
forecast
i
saw
nothing
but
the
image
of
my
girl
whom
my
tidings
would
render
happy
the
way
was
longer
than
my
fond
imagination
had
foreseen
i
did
not
reach
curling's
till
an
hour
after
sunrise
the
distance
was
full
thirty-five
miles
as
i
hastened
up
the
green
lane
leading
to
the
house
i
spied
my
bess
passing
through
a
covered
way
between
the
dwelling
and
kitchen
i
caught
her
eye
she
stopped
and
held
up
her
hands
and
then
ran
into
my
arms
what
means
my
girl
why
this
catching
of
the
breath
why
this
sobbing
look
at
me
my
love
it
is
arthur--he
who
has
treated
you
with
forgetfulness
neglect
and
cruelty
oh
do
not
she
replied
hiding
her
face
with
her
hand
one
single
reproach
added
to
my
own
will
kill
me
that
foolish
wicked
letter--i
could
tear
my
fingers
for
writing
it
but
said
i
i
will
kiss
them
and
put
them
to
my
lips
they
have
told
me
the
wishes
of
my
girl
they
have
enabled
me
to
gratify
her
wishes
i
have
come
to
carry
thee
this
very
moment
to
town
lord
bless
me
arthur
said
she
lost
in
a
sweet
confusion
and
her
cheeks
always
glowing
glowing
still
more
deeply
indeed
i
did
not
mean----i
meant
only----i
will
stay
here----i
would
rather
stay----
it
grieves
me
to
hear
that
said
i
with
earnestness
i
thought
i
was
studying
our
mutual
happiness
it
grieves
you
don't
say
so
i
would
not
grieve
you
for
the
world
but
indeed
indeed
it
is
too
soon
such
a
girl
as
i
am
not
yet
fit
to--live
in
your
city
again
she
hid
her
glowing
face
in
my
bosom
sweet
consciousness
heavenly
innocence
thought
i
may
achsa's
conjectures
prove
false--you
have
mistaken
my
design
for
i
do
not
intend
to
carry
you
to
town
with
such
a
view
as
you
have
hinted
but
merely
to
place
you
with
a
beloved
friend
with
achsa
fielding
of
whom
already
you
know
so
much
where
we
shall
enjoy
each
other's
company
without
restraint
or
intermission
i
then
proceeded
to
disclose
to
her
the
plan
suggested
by
my
friend
and
to
explain
all
the
consequences
that
would
flow
from
it
i
need
not
say
that
she
assented
to
the
scheme
she
was
all
rapture
and
gratitude
preparations
for
departure
were
easily
and
speedily
made
i
hired
a
chaise
of
a
neighbouring
farmer
and
according
to
my
promise
by
noon
the
same
day
delivered
the
timid
and
bashful
girl
into
the
arms
of
her
new
sister
she
was
received
with
the
utmost
tenderness
not
only
by
mrs
fielding
but
by
all
my
friends
her
affectionate
heart
was
encouraged
to
pour
forth
all
its
feeling
as
into
the
bosom
of
a
mother
she
was
reinspired
with
confidence
her
want
of
experience
was
supplied
by
the
gentlest
admonitions
and
instructions
in
every
plan
for
her
improvement
suggested
by
her
new
mamma
for
she
never
called
her
by
any
other
name
she
engaged
with
docility
and
eagerness
and
her
behaviour
and
her
progress
exceeded
the
most
sanguine
hopes
that
i
had
formed
as
to
the
softness
of
her
temper
and
the
acuteness
of
her
genius
those
graces
which
a
polished
education
and
intercourse
with
the
better
classes
of
society
are
adapted
to
give
my
girl
possessed
in
some
degree
by
a
native
and
intuitive
refinement
and
sagacity
of
mind
all
that
was
to
be
obtained
from
actual
observation
and
instruction
was
obtained
without
difficulty
and
in
a
short
time
nothing
but
the
affectionate
simplicity
and
unperverted
feelings
of
the
country-girl
bespoke
the
original
condition
what
art
so
busy
about
arthur
always
at
thy
pen
of
late
come
i
must
know
the
fruit
of
all
this
toil
and
all
this
meditation
i
am
determined
to
scrape
acquaintance
with
haller
and
linnus
i
will
begin
this
very
day
all
one's
friends
you
know
should
be
ours
love
has
made
many
a
patient
and
let
me
see
if
it
cannot
in
my
case
make
a
physician
but
first
what
is
all
this
writing
about
mrs
wentworth
has
put
me
upon
a
strange
task--not
disagreeable
however
but
such
as
i
should
perhaps
have
declined
had
not
the
absence
of
my
bess
and
her
mamma
made
the
time
hang
somewhat
heavy
i
have
oftener
than
once
and
far
more
circumstantially
than
now
told
her
my
adventures
but
she
is
not
satisfied
she
wants
a
written
narrative
for
some
purpose
which
she
tells
me
she
will
disclose
to
me
hereafter
luckily
my
friend
stevens
has
saved
me
more
than
half
the
trouble
he
has
done
me
the
favour
to
compile
much
of
my
history
with
his
own
hand
i
cannot
imagine
what
could
prompt
him
to
so
wearisome
an
undertaking
but
he
says
that
adventures
and
a
destiny
so
singular
as
mine
ought
not
to
be
abandoned
to
forgetfulness
like
any
vulgar
and
every-day
existence
besides
when
he
wrote
it
he
suspected
that
it
might
be
necessary
to
the
safety
of
my
reputation
and
my
life
from
the
consequences
of
my
connection
with
welbeck
time
has
annihilated
that
danger
all
enmities
and
all
suspicions
are
buried
with
that
ill-fated
wretch
wortley
has
been
won
by
my
behaviour
and
confides
in
my
integrity
now
as
much
as
he
formerly
suspected
it
i
am
glad
however
that
the
task
was
performed
it
has
saved
me
a
world
of
writing
i
had
only
to
take
up
the
broken
thread
and
bring
it
down
to
the
period
of
my
present
happiness
and
this
was
done
just
as
you
tripped
along
the
entry
this
morning
to
bed
my
friend
it
is
late
and
this
delicate
frame
is
not
half
so
able
to
encounter
fatigue
as
a
youth
spent
in
the
hay-field
and
the
dairy
might
have
been
expected
to
be
i
will
but
let
me
take
these
sheets
along
with
me
i
will
read
them
that
i
am
determined
before
i
sleep
and
watch
if
you
have
told
the
whole
truth
do
so
if
you
please
but
remember
one
thing
mrs
wentworth
requested
me
to
write
not
as
if
it
were
designed
for
her
perusal
but
for
those
who
have
no
previous
knowledge
of
her
or
of
me
'twas
an
odd
request
i
cannot
imagine
what
she
means
by
it
but
she
never
acts
without
good
reason
and
i
have
done
so
and
now
withdraw
my
dear
and
farewell
move
on
my
quill
wait
not
for
my
guidance
reanimated
with
thy
master's
spirit
all
airy
light
a
heyday
rapture
a
mounting
impulse
sways
him
lifts
him
from
the
earth
i
must
cost
what
it
will
rein
in
this
upward-pulling
forward-going--what
shall
i
call
it
but
there
are
times
and
now
is
one
of
them
when
words
are
poor
it
will
not
do--down
this
hill
up
that
steep
through
this
thicket
over
that
hedge--i
have
laboured
to
fatigue
myself
to
reconcile
me
to
repose
to
lolling
on
a
sofa
to
poring
over
a
book
to
any
thing
that
might
win
for
my
heart
a
respite
from
these
throbs
to
deceive
me
into
a
few
tolerable
moments
of
forgetfulness
let
me
see
they
tell
me
this
is
monday
night
only
three
days
yet
to
come
if
thus
restless
to-day
if
my
heart
thus
bounds
till
its
mansion
scarcely
can
hold
it
what
must
be
my
state
to-morrow
what
next
day
what
as
the
hour
hastens
on
as
the
sun
descends
as
my
hand
touches
hers
in
sign
of
wedded
unity
of
love
without
interval
of
concord
without
end
i
must
quell
these
tumults
they
will
disable
me
else
they
will
wear
out
all
my
strength
they
will
drain
away
life
itself
but
who
could
have
thought
so
soon
not
three
months
since
i
first
set
eyes
upon
her
not
three
weeks
since
our
plighted
love
and
only
three
days
to
terminate
suspense
and
give
me
all
i
must
compel
myself
to
quiet
to
sleep
i
must
find
some
refuge
from
anticipations
so
excruciating
all
extremes
are
agonies
a
joy
like
this
is
too
big
for
this
narrow
tenement
i
must
thrust
it
forth
i
must
bar
and
bolt
it
out
for
a
time
or
these
frail
walls
will
burst
asunder
the
pen
is
a
pacifier
it
checks
the
mind's
career
it
circumscribes
her
wanderings
it
traces
out
and
compels
us
to
adhere
to
one
path
it
ever
was
my
friend
often
it
has
blunted
my
vexations
hushed
my
stormy
passions
turned
my
peevishness
to
soothing
my
fierce
revenge
to
heart-dissolving
pity
perhaps
it
will
befriend
me
now
it
may
temper
my
impetuous
wishes
lull
my
intoxication
and
render
my
happiness
supportable
and
indeed
it
has
produced
partly
this
effect
already
my
blood
within
the
few
minutes
thus
employed
flows
with
less
destructive
rapidity
my
thoughts
range
themselves
in
less
disorder
and
now
that
the
conquest
is
effected
what
shall
i
say
i
must
continue
at
the
pen
or
shall
immediately
relapse
what
shall
i
say
let
me
look
back
upon
the
steps
that
led
me
hither
let
me
recount
the
preliminaries
i
cannot
do
better
and
first
as
to
achsa
fielding--to
describe
this
woman
to
recount
in
brief
so
much
of
her
history
as
has
come
to
my
knowledge
will
best
account
for
that
zeal
almost
to
idolatry
with
which
she
has
ever
since
i
thoroughly
knew
her
been
regarded
by
me
never
saw
i
one
to
whom
the
term
lovely
more
truly
belonged
and
yet
in
stature
she
is
too
low
in
complexion
dark
and
almost
sallow
and
her
eyes
though
black
and
of
piercing
lustre
have
a
cast
which
i
cannot
well
explain
it
lessens
without
destroying
their
lustre
and
their
force
to
charm
but
all
personal
defects
are
outweighed
by
her
heart
and
her
intellect
there
is
the
secret
of
her
power
to
entrance
the
soul
of
the
listener
and
beholder
it
is
not
only
when
she
sings
that
her
utterance
is
musical
it
is
not
only
when
the
occasion
is
urgent
and
the
topic
momentous
that
her
eloquence
is
rich
and
flowing
they
are
always
so
i
had
vowed
to
love
her
and
serve
her
and
been
her
frequent
visitant
long
before
i
was
acquainted
with
her
past
life
i
had
casually
picked
up
some
intelligence
from
others
or
from
her
own
remarks
i
knew
very
soon
that
she
was
english
by
birth
and
had
been
only
a
year
and
a
half
in
america
that
she
had
scarcely
passed
her
twenty-fifth
year
and
was
still
embellished
with
all
the
graces
of
youth
that
she
had
been
a
wife
but
was
uninformed
whether
the
knot
had
been
untied
by
death
or
divorce
that
she
possessed
considerable
and
even
splendid
fortune
but
the
exact
amount
and
all
besides
these
particulars
were
unknown
to
me
till
some
time
after
our
acquaintance
was
begun
one
evening
she
had
been
talking
very
earnestly
on
the
influence
annexed
in
great
britain
to
birth
and
had
given
me
some
examples
of
this
influence
meanwhile
my
eyes
were
fixed
steadfastly
on
hers
the
peculiarity
in
their
expression
never
before
affected
me
so
strongly
a
vague
resemblance
to
something
seen
elsewhere
on
the
same
day
occurred
and
occasioned
me
to
exclaim
suddenly
in
a
pause
of
her
discourse--
as
i
live
my
good
mamma
those
eyes
of
yours
have
told
me
a
secret
i
almost
think
they
spoke
to
me
and
i
am
not
less
amazed
at
the
strangeness
than
at
the
distinctness
of
their
story
and
pr'ythee
what
have
they
said
perhaps
i
was
mistaken
i
might
have
been
deceived
by
a
fancied
voice
or
have
confounded
one
word
with
another
near
akin
to
it
but
let
me
die
if
i
did
not
think
they
said
that
you
were--a
jew
at
this
sound
her
features
were
instantly
veiled
with
the
deepest
sorrow
and
confusion
she
put
her
hand
to
her
eyes
the
tears
started
and
she
sobbed
my
surprise
at
this
effect
of
my
words
was
equal
to
my
contrition
i
besought
her
to
pardon
me
for
having
thus
unknowingly
alarmed
and
grieved
her
after
she
had
regained
some
composure
she
said
you
have
not
offended
arthur
your
surmise
was
just
and
natural
and
could
not
always
have
escaped
you
connected
with
that
word
are
many
sources
of
anguish
which
time
has
not
and
never
will
dry
up
and
the
less
i
think
of
past
events
the
less
will
my
peace
be
disturbed
i
was
desirous
that
you
should
know
nothing
of
me
but
what
you
see
nothing
but
the
present
and
the
future
merely
that
no
allusions
might
occur
in
our
conversation
which
will
call
up
sorrows
and
regrets
that
will
avail
nothing
i
now
perceive
the
folly
of
endeavouring
to
keep
you
in
ignorance
and
shall
therefore
once
for
all
inform
you
of
what
has
befallen
me
that
your
inquiries
and
suggestions
may
be
made
and
fully
satisfied
at
once
and
your
curiosity
have
no
motive
for
calling
back
my
thoughts
to
what
i
ardently
desire
to
bury
in
oblivion
my
father
was
indeed
a
jew
and
one
of
the
most
opulent
of
his
nation
in
london--a
portuguese
by
birth
but
came
to
london
when
a
boy
he
had
few
of
the
moral
or
external
qualities
of
jews
for
i
suppose
there
is
some
justice
in
the
obloquy
that
follows
them
so
closely
he
was
frugal
without
meanness
and
cautious
in
his
dealings
without
extortion
i
need
not
fear
to
say
this
for
it
was
the
general
voice
me
an
only
child
and
of
course
the
darling
of
my
parents
they
trained
up
in
the
most
liberal
manner
my
education
was
purely
english
i
learned
the
same
things
and
of
the
same
masters
with
my
neighbours
except
frequenting
their
church
and
repeating
their
creed
and
partaking
of
the
same
food
i
saw
no
difference
between
them
and
me
hence
i
grew
more
indifferent
perhaps
than
was
proper
to
the
distinctions
of
religion
they
were
never
enforced
upon
me
no
pains
were
taken
to
fill
me
with
scruples
and
antipathies
they
never
stood
as
i
may
say
upon
the
threshold
they
were
often
thought
upon
but
were
vague
and
easily
eluded
or
forgotten
hence
it
was
that
my
heart
too
readily
admitted
impressions
that
more
zeal
and
more
parental
caution
would
have
saved
me
from
they
could
scarcely
be
avoided
as
my
society
was
wholly
english
and
my
youth
my
education
and
my
father's
wealth
made
me
an
object
of
much
attention
and
the
same
causes
that
lulled
to
sleep
my
own
watchfulness
had
the
same
effect
upon
that
of
others
to
regret
or
to
praise
this
remissness
is
now
too
late
certain
it
is
that
my
destiny
and
not
a
happy
destiny
was
fixed
by
it
the
fruit
of
this
remissness
was
a
passion
for
one
who
fully
returned
it
almost
as
young
as
i
who
was
only
sixteen
he
knew
as
little
as
myself
what
obstacles
the
difference
of
our
births
was
likely
to
raise
between
us
his
father
sir
ralph
fielding
a
man
nobly
born
high
in
office
splendidly
allied
could
not
be
expected
to
consent
to
the
marriage
of
his
eldest
son
in
such
green
youth
to
the
daughter
of
an
alien
a
portuguese
a
jew
but
these
impediments
were
not
seen
by
my
ignorance
and
were
overlooked
by
the
youth's
passion
but
strange
to
tell
what
common
prudence
would
have
so
confidently
predicted
did
not
happen
sir
ralph
had
a
numerous
family
likely
to
be
still
more
so
had
but
slender
patrimony
the
income
of
his
offices
nearly
made
up
his
all
the
young
man
was
headstrong
impetuous
and
would
probably
disregard
the
inclinations
of
his
family
yet
the
father
would
not
consent
but
on
one
condition--that
of
my
admission
to
the
english
church
no
very
strenuous
opposition
to
these
terms
could
be
expected
from
me
at
so
thoughtless
an
age
with
an
education
so
unfavourable
to
religious
impressions
swayed
likewise
by
the
strongest
of
human
passions
made
somewhat
impatient
by
the
company
i
kept
of
the
disrepute
and
scorn
to
which
the
jewish
nation
are
everywhere
condemned
i
could
not
be
expected
to
be
very
averse
to
the
scheme
my
fears
as
to
what
my
father's
decision
would
be
were
soon
at
an
end
he
loved
his
child
too
well
to
thwart
her
wishes
in
so
essential
a
point
finding
in
me
no
scruples
no
unwillingness
he
thought
it
absurd
to
be
scrupulous
for
me
my
own
heart
having
abjured
my
religion
it
was
absurd
to
make
any
difficulty
about
a
formal
renunciation
these
were
his
avowed
reasons
for
concurrence
but
time
showed
that
he
had
probably
other
reasons
founded
indeed
in
his
regard
for
my
happiness
but
such
as
if
they
had
been
known
would
probably
have
strengthened
into
invincible
the
reluctance
of
my
lover's
family
no
marriage
was
ever
attended
with
happier
presages
the
numerous
relations
of
my
husband
admitted
me
with
the
utmost
cordiality
among
them
my
father's
tenderness
was
unabated
by
this
change
and
those
humiliations
to
which
i
had
before
been
exposed
were
now
no
more
and
every
tie
was
strengthened
at
the
end
of
a
year
by
the
feelings
of
a
mother
i
had
need
indeed
to
know
a
season
of
happiness
that
i
might
be
fitted
to
endure
the
sad
reverses
that
succeeded
one
after
the
other
my
disasters
came
each
one
more
heavy
than
the
last
and
in
such
swift
succession
that
they
hardly
left
me
time
to
breathe
i
had
scarcely
left
my
chamber
i
had
scarcely
recovered
my
usual
health
and
was
able
to
press
with
true
fervour
the
new
and
precious
gift
to
my
bosom
when
melancholy
tidings
came
i
was
in
the
country
at
the
seat
of
my
father-in-law
when
the
messenger
arrived
a
shocking
tale
it
was
and
told
abruptly
with
every
unpitying
aggravation
i
hinted
to
you
once
my
father's
death
the
kind
of
death--oh
my
friend
it
was
horrible
he
was
then
a
placid
venerable
old
man
though
many
symptoms
of
disquiet
had
long
before
been
discovered
by
my
mother's
watchful
tenderness
yet
none
could
suspect
him
capable
of
such
a
deed
for
none
so
carefully
had
he
conducted
his
affairs
suspected
the
havoc
that
mischance
had
made
of
his
property
i
that
had
so
much
reason
to
love
my
father--i
will
leave
you
to
imagine
how
i
was
affected
by
a
catastrophe
so
dreadful
so
unlooked-for
much
less
could
i
suspect
the
cause
of
his
despair
yet
he
had
foreseen
his
ruin
before
my
marriage
had
resolved
to
defer
it
for
his
daughter's
and
his
wife's
sake
as
long
as
possible
but
had
still
determined
not
to
survive
the
day
that
should
reduce
him
to
indigence
the
desperate
act
was
thus
preconcerted--thus
deliberate
the
true
state
of
his
affairs
was
laid
open
by
his
death
the
failure
of
great
mercantile
houses
at
frankfort
and
liege
was
the
cause
of
his
disasters
thus
were
my
prospects
shut
in
that
wealth
which
no
doubt
furnished
the
chief
inducement
with
my
husband's
family
to
concur
in
his
choice
was
now
suddenly
exchanged
for
poverty
bred
up
as
i
had
been
in
pomp
and
luxury
conscious
that
my
wealth
was
my
chief
security
from
the
contempt
of
the
proud
and
bigoted
and
my
chief
title
to
the
station
to
which
i
had
been
raised
and
which
i
the
more
delighted
in
because
it
enabled
me
to
confer
so
great
obligations
on
my
husband--what
reverse
could
be
harder
than
this
and
how
much
bitterness
was
added
by
it
to
the
grief
occasioned
by
the
violent
death
of
my
father
yet
loss
of
fortune
though
it
mortified
my
pride
did
not
prove
my
worst
calamity
perhaps
it
was
scarcely
to
be
ranked
with
evils
since
it
furnished
a
touchstone
by
which
my
husband's
affections
were
to
be
tried
especially
as
the
issue
of
the
trial
was
auspicious
for
my
misfortune
seemed
only
to
heighten
the
interest
which
my
character
had
made
for
me
in
the
hearts
of
all
that
knew
me
the
paternal
regards
of
sir
ralph
had
always
been
tender
but
that
tenderness
seemed
now
to
be
redoubled
new
events
made
this
consolation
still
more
necessary
my
unhappy
mother--she
was
nearer
to
the
dreadful
scene
when
it
happened
had
no
surviving
object
to
beguile
her
sorrow
was
rendered
by
long
habit
more
dependent
upon
fortune
than
her
child
a
melancholy
always
mute
was
the
first
effect
upon
my
mother
nothing
could
charm
her
eye
or
her
ear
sweet
sounds
that
she
once
loved
and
especially
when
her
darling
child
was
the
warbler
were
heard
no
longer
how
with
streaming
eyes
have
i
sat
and
watched
the
dear
lady
and
endeavoured
to
catch
her
eye
to
rouse
her
attention--but
i
must
not
think
of
these
things
but
even
this
distress
was
little
in
comparison
with
what
was
to
come
a
frenzy
thus
mute
motionless
and
vacant
was
succeeded
by
fits
talkative
outrageous
requiring
incessant
superintendence
restraint
and
even
violence
why
led
you
me
thus
back
to
my
sad
remembrances
excuse
me
for
the
present
i
will
tell
you
the
rest
some
other
time
to-morrow
to-morrow
accordingly
my
friend
resumed
her
story
let
me
now
make
an
end
said
she
of
my
mournful
narrative
and
never
i
charge
you
do
any
thing
to
revive
it
again
deep
as
was
my
despondency
occasioned
by
these
calamities
i
was
not
destitute
of
some
joy
my
husband
and
my
child
were
lovely
and
affectionate
in
their
caresses
in
their
welfare
i
found
peace
and
might
still
have
found
it
had
there
not
been----
but
why
should
i
open
afresh
wounds
which
time
has
imperfectly
closed
but
the
story
must
some
time
be
told
to
you
and
the
sooner
it
is
told
and
dismissed
to
forgetfulness
the
better
my
ill
fate
led
me
into
company
with
a
woman
too
well
known
in
the
idle
and
dissipated
circles
her
character
was
not
unknown
to
me
there
was
nothing
in
her
features
or
air
to
obviate
disadvantageous
prepossessions
i
sought
not
her
intercourse
i
rather
shunned
it
as
unpleasing
and
discreditable
but
she
would
not
be
repulsed
self-invited
she
made
herself
my
frequent
guest
took
unsolicited
part
in
my
concerns
did
me
many
kind
offices
and
at
length
in
spite
of
my
counter-inclination
won
upon
my
sympathy
and
gratitude
no
one
in
the
world
did
i
fondly
think
had
i
less
reason
to
fear
than
mrs
waring
her
character
excited
not
the
slightest
apprehension
for
my
own
safety
she
was
upwards
of
forty
nowise
remarkable
for
grace
or
beauty
tawdry
in
her
dress
accustomed
to
render
more
conspicuous
the
traces
of
age
by
her
attempts
to
hide
them
the
mother
of
a
numerous
family
with
a
mind
but
slenderly
cultivated
always
careful
to
save
appearances
studiously
preserving
distance
with
my
husband
and
he
like
myself
enduring
rather
than
wishing
her
society
what
could
i
fear
from
the
arts
of
such
a
one
but
alas
the
woman
had
consummate
address
patience
too
that
nothing
could
tire
watchfulness
that
none
could
detect
insinuation
the
wiliest
and
most
subtle
thus
wound
she
herself
into
my
affections
by
an
unexampled
perseverance
in
seeming
kindness
by
tender
confidence
by
artful
glosses
of
past
misconduct
by
self-rebukes
and
feigned
contritions
never
were
stratagems
so
intricate
dissimulation
so
profound
but
still
that
such
a
one
should
seduce
my
husband
young
generous
ambitious
impatient
of
contumely
and
reproach
and
surely
not
indifferent
before
this
fatal
intercourse
not
indifferent
to
his
wife
and
child--yet
so
it
was
i
saw
his
discontents
his
struggles
i
heard
him
curse
this
woman
and
the
more
deeply
for
my
attempts
unconscious
as
i
was
of
her
machinations
to
reconcile
them
to
each
other
to
do
away
what
seemed
a
causeless
indignation
or
antipathy
against
her
how
little
i
suspected
the
nature
of
the
conflict
in
his
heart
between
a
new
passion
and
the
claims
of
pride
of
conscience
and
of
humanity
the
claims
of
a
child
and
a
wife
a
wife
already
in
affliction
and
placing
all
that
yet
remained
of
happiness
in
the
firmness
of
his
virtue
in
the
continuance
of
his
love
a
wife
at
the
very
hour
of
his
meditated
flight
full
of
terrors
at
the
near
approach
of
an
event
whose
agonies
demand
a
double
share
of
a
husband's
supporting
encouraging
love----
good
heaven
for
what
evils
are
some
of
thy
creatures
reserved
resignation
to
thy
decree
in
the
last
and
most
cruel
distress
was
indeed
a
hard
task
he
was
gone
some
unavoidable
engagement
calling
him
to
hamburg
was
pleaded
yet
to
leave
me
at
such
an
hour
i
dared
not
upbraid
nor
object
the
tale
was
so
specious
the
fortunes
of
a
friend
depended
on
his
punctual
journey
the
falsehood
of
his
story
too
soon
made
itself
known
he
was
gone
in
company
with
his
detested
paramour
yet
though
my
vigilance
was
easily
deceived
it
was
not
so
with
others
a
creditor
who
had
his
bond
for
three
thousand
pounds
pursued
and
arrested
him
at
harwich
he
was
thrown
into
prison
but
his
companion--let
me
at
least
say
that
in
her
praise--would
not
desert
him
she
took
lodging
near
the
place
of
his
confinement
and
saw
him
daily
that
had
she
not
done
it
and
had
my
personal
condition
allowed
should
have
been
my
province
indignation
and
grief
hastened
the
painful
crisis
with
me
i
did
not
weep
that
the
second
fruit
of
this
unhappy
union
saw
not
the
light
i
wept
only
that
this
hour
of
agony
was
not
to
its
unfortunate
mother
the
last
i
felt
not
anger
i
had
nothing
but
compassion
for
fielding
gladly
would
i
have
recalled
him
to
my
arms
and
to
virtue
i
wrote
adjuring
him
by
all
our
past
joys
to
return
vowing
only
gratitude
for
his
new
affection
and
claiming
only
the
recompense
of
seeing
him
restored
to
his
family
to
liberty
to
reputation
but
alas
fielding
had
a
good
but
a
proud
heart
he
looked
upon
his
error
with
remorse
with
self-detestation
and
with
the
fatal
belief
that
it
could
not
be
retrieved
shame
made
him
withstand
all
my
reasonings
and
persuasions
and
in
the
hurry
of
his
feelings
he
made
solemn
vows
that
he
would
in
the
moment
of
restored
liberty
abjure
his
country
and
his
family
forever
he
bore
indignantly
the
yoke
of
his
new
attachment
but
he
strove
in
vain
to
shake
it
off
her
behaviour
always
yielding
doting
supplicative
preserved
him
in
her
fetters
though
upbraided
spurned
and
banished
from
his
presence
she
would
not
leave
him
but
by
new
efforts
and
new
artifices
soothed
appeased
and
won
again
and
kept
his
tenderness
what
my
entreaties
were
unable
to
effect
his
father
could
not
hope
to
accomplish
he
offered
to
take
him
from
prison
the
creditor
offered
to
cancel
the
bond
if
he
would
return
to
me
but
this
condition
he
refused
all
his
kindred
and
one
who
had
been
his
bosom-friend
from
childhood
joined
in
beseeching
his
compliance
with
these
conditions
but
his
pride
his
dread
of
my
merited
reproaches
the
merits
and
dissuasions
of
his
new
companion
whose
sacrifices
for
his
sake
had
not
been
small
were
obstacles
which
nothing
could
subdue
far
indeed
was
i
from
imposing
these
conditions
i
waited
only
till
by
certain
arrangements
i
could
gather
enough
to
pay
his
debts
to
enable
him
to
execute
his
vow
empty
would
have
been
my
claims
to
his
affection
if
i
could
have
suffered
with
the
means
of
his
deliverance
in
my
hands
my
husband
to
remain
a
moment
in
prison
the
remains
of
my
father's
vast
fortune
was
a
jointure
of
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
settled
on
my
mother
and
after
her
death
on
me
my
mother's
helpless
condition
put
this
revenue
into
my
disposal
by
this
means
was
i
enabled
without
the
knowledge
of
my
father-in-law
or
my
husband
to
purchase
the
debt
and
dismiss
him
from
prison
he
set
out
instantly
in
company
with
his
paramour
to
france
when
somewhat
recovered
from
the
shock
of
this
calamity
i
took
up
my
abode
with
my
mother
what
she
had
was
enough
as
you
perhaps
will
think
for
plentiful
subsistence
but
to
us
with
habits
of
a
different
kind
it
was
little
better
than
poverty
that
reflection
my
father's
memory
my
mother's
deplorable
state
which
every
year
grew
worse
and
the
late
misfortune
were
the
chief
companions
of
my
thoughts
the
dear
child
whose
smiles
were
uninterrupted
by
his
mother's
afflictions
was
some
consolation
in
my
solitude
to
his
instruction
and
to
my
mother's
wants
all
my
hours
were
devoted
i
was
sometimes
not
without
the
hope
of
better
days
full
as
my
mind
was
of
fielding's
merits
convinced
by
former
proofs
of
his
ardent
and
generous
spirit
i
trusted
that
time
and
reflection
would
destroy
that
spell
by
which
he
was
now
bound
for
some
time
the
progress
of
these
reflections
was
not
known
in
leaving
england
fielding
dropped
all
correspondence
and
connection
with
his
native
country
he
parted
with
the
woman
at
rouen
leaving
no
trace
behind
him
by
which
she
might
follow
him
as
she
wished
to
do
she
never
returned
to
england
but
died
a
twelvemonth
afterwards
in
switzerland
as
to
me
i
had
only
to
muse
day
and
night
upon
the
possible
destiny
of
this
beloved
fugitive
his
incensed
father
cared
not
for
him
he
had
cast
him
out
of
his
paternal
affections
ceased
to
make
inquiries
respecting
him
and
even
wished
never
to
hear
of
him
again
my
boy
succeeded
to
my
husband's
place
in
his
grandfather's
affections
and
in
the
hopes
and
views
of
the
family
and
his
mother
wanted
nothing
which
their
compassionate
and
respectful
love
could
bestow
three
long
and
tedious
years
passed
away
and
no
tidings
were
received
whether
he
were
living
or
dead
nobody
could
tell
at
length
an
english
traveller
going
out
of
the
customary
road
from
italy
met
with
fielding
in
a
town
in
the
venaissin
his
manners
habits
and
language
had
become
french
he
seemed
unwilling
to
be
recognised
by
an
old
acquaintance
but
not
being
able
to
avoid
this
and
becoming
gradually
familiar
he
informed
the
traveller
of
many
particulars
in
his
present
situation
it
appeared
that
he
had
made
himself
useful
to
a
neighbouring
seigneur
in
whose
chteau
he
had
long
lived
on
the
footing
of
a
brother
france
he
had
resolved
to
make
his
future
country
and
among
other
changes
for
that
end
he
had
laid
aside
his
english
name
and
taken
that
of
his
patron
which
was
perrin
he
had
endeavoured
to
compensate
himself
for
all
other
privations
by
devoting
himself
to
rural
amusements
and
to
study
he
carefully
shunned
all
inquiries
respecting
me
but
when
my
name
was
mentioned
by
his
friend
who
knew
well
all
that
had
happened
and
my
general
welfare
together
with
that
of
his
son
asserted
he
showed
deep
sensibility
and
even
consented
that
i
should
be
made
acquainted
with
his
situation
i
cannot
describe
the
effect
of
this
intelligence
on
me
my
hopes
of
bringing
him
back
to
me
were
suddenly
revived
i
wrote
him
a
letter
in
which
i
poured
forth
my
whole
heart
but
his
answer
contained
avowals
of
all
his
former
resolutions
to
which
time
had
only
made
his
adherence
more
easy
a
second
and
third
letter
were
written
and
an
offer
made
to
follow
him
to
his
retreat
and
share
his
exile
but
all
my
efforts
availed
nothing
he
solemnly
and
repeatedly
renounced
all
the
claims
of
a
husband
over
me
and
absolved
me
from
every
obligation
as
a
wife
his
part
in
this
correspondence
was
performed
without
harshness
or
contempt
a
strange
mixture
there
was
of
pathos
and
indifference
of
tenderness
and
resolution
hence
i
continually
derived
hope
which
time
however
brought
no
nearer
to
certainty
at
the
opening
of
the
revolution
the
name
of
perrin
appeared
among
the
deputies
to
the
constituent
assembly
for
the
district
in
which
he
resided
he
had
thus
succeeded
in
gaining
all
the
rights
of
a
french
citizen
and
the
hopes
of
his
return
became
almost
extinct
but
that
and
every
other
hope
respecting
him
has
since
been
totally
extinguished
by
his
marriage
with
marguerite
d'almont
a
young
lady
of
great
merit
and
fortune
and
a
native
of
avignon
a
long
period
of
suspense
was
now
at
an
end
and
left
me
in
a
state
almost
as
full
of
anguish
as
that
which
our
first
separation
produced
my
sorrows
were
increased
by
my
mother's
death
and
this
incident
freeing
me
from
those
restraints
upon
my
motions
which
before
existed
i
determined
to
come
to
america
my
son
was
now
eight
years
old
and
his
grandfather
claiming
the
province
of
his
instruction
i
was
persuaded
to
part
with
him
that
he
might
be
sent
to
a
distant
school
thus
was
another
tie
removed
and
in
spite
of
the
well-meant
importunities
of
my
friends
i
persisted
in
my
scheme
of
crossing
the
ocean
i
could
not
help
at
this
part
of
her
narration
expressing
my
surprise
that
any
motives
were
strong
enough
to
recommend
this
scheme
it
was
certainly
a
freak
of
despair
a
few
months
would
perhaps
have
allayed
the
fresh
grief
and
reconciled
me
to
my
situation
but
i
would
not
pause
or
deliberate
my
scheme
was
opposed
by
my
friends
with
great
earnestness
during
my
voyage
affrighted
by
the
dangers
which
surrounded
me
and
to
which
i
was
wholly
unused
i
heartily
repented
of
my
resolution
but
now
methinks
i
have
reason
to
rejoice
at
my
perseverance
i
have
come
into
a
scene
and
society
so
new
i
have
had
so
many
claims
made
upon
my
ingenuity
and
fortitude
that
my
mind
has
been
diverted
in
some
degree
from
former
sorrows
there
are
even
times
when
i
wholly
forget
them
and
catch
myself
indulging
in
cheerful
reveries
i
have
often
reflected
with
surprise
on
the
nature
of
my
own
mind
it
is
eight
years
since
my
father's
violent
death
how
few
of
my
hours
since
that
period
have
been
blessed
with
serenity
how
many
nights
and
days
in
hateful
and
lingering
succession
have
been
bathed
in
tears
and
tormented
with
regrets
that
i
am
still
alive
with
so
many
causes
of
death
and
with
such
a
slow-consuming
malady
is
surely
to
be
wondered
at
i
believe
the
worst
foes
of
man
at
least
of
men
in
grief
are
solitude
and
idleness
the
same
eternally-occurring
round
of
objects
feeds
his
disease
and
the
effects
of
mere
vacancy
and
uniformity
are
sometimes
mistaken
for
those
of
grief
yes
i
am
glad
i
came
to
america
my
relations
are
importunate
for
my
return
and
till
lately
i
had
some
thoughts
of
it
but
i
think
now
i
shall
stay
where
i
am
for
the
rest
of
my
days
since
i
arrived
i
am
become
more
of
a
student
than
i
used
to
be
i
always
loved
literature
but
never
till
of
late
had
i
a
mind
enough
at
ease
to
read
with
advantage
i
now
find
pleasure
in
the
occupation
which
i
never
expected
to
find
you
see
in
what
manner
i
live
the
letters
which
i
brought
secured
me
a
flattering
reception
from
the
best
people
in
your
country
but
scenes
of
gay
resort
had
nothing
to
attract
me
and
i
quickly
withdrew
to
that
seclusion
in
which
you
now
find
me
here
always
at
leisure
and
mistress
of
every
laudable
means
of
gratification
i
am
not
without
the
belief
of
serene
days
yet
to
come
i
now
ventured
to
inquire
what
were
her
latest
tidings
of
her
husband
at
the
opening
of
the
revolution
i
told
you
he
became
a
champion
of
the
people
by
his
zeal
and
his
efforts
he
acquired
such
importance
as
to
be
deputed
to
the
national
assembly
in
this
post
he
was
the
adherent
of
violent
measures
till
the
subversion
of
monarchy
and
then
when
too
late
for
his
safety
he
checked
his
career
and
what
has
since
become
of
him
she
sighed
deeply
you
were
yesterday
reading
a
list
of
the
proscribed
under
robespierre
i
checked
you
i
had
good
reason
but
this
subject
grows
too
painful
let
us
change
it
some
time
after
i
ventured
to
renew
this
topic
and
discovered
that
fielding
under
his
new
name
of
perrin
d'almont
was
among
the
outlawed
deputies
of
last
year1
and
had
been
slain
in
resisting
the
officers
sent
to
arrest
him
my
friend
had
been
informed
that
his
wife
marguerite
d'almont
whom
she
had
reason
to
believe
a
woman
of
great
merit
had
eluded
persecution
and
taken
refuge
in
some
part
of
america
she
had
made
various
attempts
but
in
vain
to
find
out
her
retreat
ah
said
i
you
must
commission
me
to
find
her
i
will
hunt
her
through
the
continent
from
penobscot
to
savannah
i
will
not
leave
a
nook
unsearched
footnote

1793
none
will
be
surprised
that
to
a
woman
thus
unfortunate
and
thus
deserving
my
heart
willingly
rendered
up
all
its
sympathies
that
as
i
partook
of
all
her
grief
i
hailed
with
equal
delight
those
omens
of
felicity
which
now
at
length
seemed
to
play
in
her
fancy
i
saw
her
often--as
often
as
my
engagements
would
permit
and
oftener
than
i
allowed
myself
to
visit
any
other
in
this
i
was
partly
selfish
so
much
entertainment
so
much
of
the
best
instruction
did
her
conversation
afford
me
that
i
never
had
enough
of
it
her
experience
had
been
so
much
larger
than
mine
and
so
wholly
different
and
she
possessed
such
unbounded
facility
of
recounting
all
she
had
seen
and
felt
and
absolute
sincerity
and
unreserve
in
this
respect
were
so
fully
established
between
us
that
i
can
imagine
nothing
equally
instructive
and
delightful
with
her
conversation
books
are
cold
jejune
vexatious
in
their
sparingness
of
information
at
one
time
and
their
impertinent
loquacity
at
another
besides
all
they
choose
to
give
they
give
at
once
they
allow
no
questions
offer
no
further
explanations
and
bend
not
to
the
caprices
of
our
curiosity
they
talk
to
us
behind
a
screen
their
tone
is
lifeless
and
monotonous
they
charm
not
our
attention
by
mute
significances
of
gesture
and
looks
they
spread
no
light
upon
their
meaning
by
cadences
and
emphasis
and
pause
how
different
was
mrs
fielding's
discourse
so
versatile
so
bending
to
the
changes
of
the
occasion
so
obsequious
to
my
curiosity
and
so
abundant
in
that
very
knowledge
in
which
i
was
most
deficient
and
on
which
i
set
the
most
value
the
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
of
society
as
it
existed
in
another
world
more
abundant
in
the
varieties
of
customs
and
characters
than
i
had
ever
had
the
power
to
witness
partly
selfish
i
have
said
my
motives
were
but
not
so
as
long
as
i
saw
that
my
friend
derived
pleasure
in
her
turn
from
my
company
not
that
i
could
add
directly
to
her
knowledge
or
pleasure
but
that
expansion
of
heart
that
ease
of
utterance
and
flow
of
ideas
which
always
were
occasioned
by
my
approach
were
sources
of
true
pleasure
of
which
she
had
been
long
deprived
and
for
which
her
privation
had
given
her
a
higher
relish
than
ever
she
lived
in
great
affluence
and
independence
but
made
use
of
her
privileges
of
fortune
chiefly
to
secure
to
herself
the
command
of
her
own
time
she
had
been
long
ago
tired
and
disgusted
with
the
dull
and
fulsome
uniformity
and
parade
of
the
play-house
and
ballroom
formal
visits
were
endured
as
mortifications
and
penances
by
which
the
delights
of
privacy
and
friendly
intercourse
were
by
contrast
increased
music
she
loved
but
never
sought
it
in
places
of
public
resort
or
from
the
skill
of
mercenary
performers
and
books
were
not
the
least
of
her
pleasures
as
to
me
i
was
wax
in
her
hand
without
design
and
without
effort
i
was
always
of
that
form
she
wished
me
to
assume
my
own
happiness
became
a
secondary
passion
and
her
gratification
the
great
end
of
my
being
when
with
her
i
thought
not
of
myself
i
had
scarcely
a
separate
or
independent
existence
since
my
senses
were
occupied
by
her
and
my
mind
was
full
of
those
ideas
which
her
discourse
communicated
to
meditate
on
her
looks
and
words
and
to
pursue
the
means
suggested
by
my
own
thoughts
or
by
her
conducive
in
any
way
to
her
good
was
all
my
business
what
a
fate
said
i
at
the
conclusion
of
one
of
our
interviews
has
been
yours
but
thank
heaven
the
storm
has
disappeared
before
the
age
of
sensibility
has
gone
past
and
without
drying
up
every
source
of
happiness
you
are
still
young
all
your
powers
unimpaired
rich
in
the
compassion
and
esteem
of
the
world
wholly
independent
of
the
claims
and
caprices
of
others
amply
supplied
with
that
means
of
usefulness
called
money
wise
in
that
experience
which
only
adversity
can
give
past
evils
and
sufferings
if
incurred
and
endured
without
guilt
if
called
to
view
without
remorse
make
up
the
materials
of
present
joy
they
cheer
our
most
dreary
hours
with
the
widespread
accents
of
'well
done'
and
they
heighten
our
pleasures
into
somewhat
of
celestial
brilliancy
by
furnishing
a
deep
a
ruefully-deep
contrast
from
this
moment
i
will
cease
to
weep
for
you
i
will
call
you
the
happiest
of
women
i
will
share
with
you
your
happiness
by
witnessing
it
but
that
shall
not
content
me
i
must
some
way
contribute
to
it
tell
me
how
i
shall
serve
you
what
can
i
do
to
make
you
happier
poor
am
i
in
every
thing
but
zeal
but
still
i
may
do
something
what--pray
tell
me
what
can
i
do
she
looked
at
me
with
sweet
and
solemn
significance
what
it
was
exactly
i
could
not
divine
yet
i
was
strangely
affected
by
it
it
was
but
a
glance
instantly
withdrawn
she
made
me
no
answer
you
must
not
be
silent
you
must
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
hitherto
i
have
done
nothing
all
the
service
is
on
your
side
your
conversation
has
been
my
study
a
delightful
study
but
the
profit
has
only
been
mine
tell
me
how
i
can
be
grateful
my
voice
and
manner
i
believe
seldom
belie
my
feelings
at
this
time
i
had
almost
done
what
a
second
thought
made
me
suspect
to
be
unauthorized
yet
i
cannot
tell
why
my
heart
had
nothing
in
it
but
reverence
and
admiration
was
she
not
the
substitute
of
my
lost
mamma
would
i
not
have
clasped
that
beloved
shade
yet
the
two
beings
were
not
just
the
same
or
i
should
not
as
now
have
checked
myself
and
only
pressed
her
hand
to
my
lips
tell
me
repeated
i
what
can
i
do
to
serve
you
i
read
to
you
a
little
now
and
you
are
pleased
with
my
reading
i
copy
for
you
when
you
want
the
time
i
guide
the
reins
for
you
when
you
choose
to
ride
humble
offices
indeed
though
perhaps
all
that
a
raw
youth
like
me
can
do
for
you
but
i
can
be
still
more
assiduous
i
can
read
several
hours
in
the
day
instead
of
one
i
can
write
ten
times
as
much
as
now
are
you
not
my
lost
mamma
come
back
again
and
yet
not
exactly
her
i
think
something
different
something
better
i
believe
if
that
be
possible
at
any
rate
methinks
i
would
be
wholly
yours
i
shall
be
impatient
and
uneasy
till
every
act
every
thought
every
minute
someway
does
you
good
how
said
i
her
eye
still
averted
seemed
to
hold
back
the
tear
with
difficulty
and
she
made
a
motion
as
if
to
rise
have
i
grieved
you
have
i
been
importunate
forgive
me
if
i
have
offended
you
her
eyes
now
overflowed
without
restraint
she
articulated
with
difficulty
tears
are
too
prompt
with
me
of
late
but
they
did
not
upbraid
you
pain
has
often
caused
them
to
flow
but
now
it--is--pleasure
what
a
heart
must
yours
be
i
resumed
when
susceptible
of
such
pleasures
what
pangs
must
formerly
have
rent
it--but
you
are
not
displeased
you
say
with
my
importunate
zeal
you
will
accept
me
as
your
own
in
every
thing
direct
me
prescribe
to
me
there
must
be
something
in
which
i
can
be
of
still
more
use
to
you
some
way
in
which
i
can
be
wholly
yours----
wholly
mine
she
repeated
in
a
smothered
voice
and
rising
leave
me
arthur
it
is
too
late
for
you
to
be
here
it
was
wrong
to
stay
so
late
i
have
been
wrong
but
how
too
late
i
entered
but
this
moment
it
is
twilight
still
is
it
not
no
it
is
almost
twelve
you
have
been
here
a
long
four
hours
short
ones
i
would
rather
say--but
indeed
you
must
go
what
made
me
so
thoughtless
of
the
time
but
i
will
go
yet
not
till
you
forgive
me
i
approached
her
with
a
confidence
and
for
a
purpose
at
which
upon
reflection
i
am
not
a
little
surprised
but
the
being
called
mervyn
is
not
the
same
in
her
company
and
in
that
of
another
what
is
the
difference
and
whence
comes
it
her
words
and
looks
engross
me
my
mind
wants
room
for
any
other
object
but
why
inquire
whence
the
difference
the
superiority
of
her
merits
and
attractions
to
all
those
whom
i
knew
would
surely
account
for
my
fervour
indifference
if
i
felt
it
would
be
the
only
just
occasion
of
wonder
the
hour
was
indeed
too
late
and
i
hastened
home
stevens
was
waiting
my
return
with
some
anxiety
i
apologized
for
my
delay
and
recounted
to
him
what
had
just
passed
he
listened
with
more
than
usual
interest
when
i
had
finished--
mervyn
said
he
you
seem
not
be
aware
of
your
present
situation
from
what
you
now
tell
me
and
from
what
you
have
formerly
told
me
one
thing
seems
very
plain
to
me
pr'ythee
what
is
it
eliza
hadwin--do
you
wish--could
you
bear--to
see
her
the
wife
of
another
five
years
hence
i
will
answer
you
then
my
answer
may
be
'no
i
wish
her
only
to
be
mine'
till
then
i
wish
her
only
to
be
my
pupil
my
ward
my
sister
but
these
are
remote
considerations
they
are
bars
to
marriage
but
not
to
love
would
it
not
molest
and
disquiet
you
to
observe
in
her
a
passion
for
another
it
would
but
only
on
her
own
account
not
on
mine
at
a
suitable
age
it
is
very
likely
i
may
love
her
because
it
is
likely
if
she
holds
on
in
her
present
career
she
will
then
be
worthy
but
at
present
though
i
would
die
to
insure
her
happiness
i
have
no
wish
to
insure
it
by
marriage
with
her
is
there
no
other
whom
you
love
no
there
is
one
worthier
than
all
others
one
whom
i
wish
the
woman
who
shall
be
my
wife
to
resemble
in
all
things
and
who
is
this
model
you
know
i
can
only
mean
achsa
fielding
if
you
love
her
likeness
why
not
love
herself
i
felt
my
heart
leap--what
a
thought
is
that
love
her
i
do
as
i
love
my
god
as
i
love
virtue
to
love
her
in
another
sense
would
brand
me
for
a
lunatic
to
love
her
as
a
woman
then
appears
to
you
an
act
of
folly
in
me
it
would
be
worse
than
folly
'twould
be
frenzy
and
why
why
really
my
friend
you
astonish
me
nay
you
startle
me--for
a
question
like
that
implies
a
doubt
in
you
whether
i
have
not
actually
harboured
the
thought
no
said
he
smiling
presumptuous
though
you
be
you
have
not
to-be-sure
reached
so
high
a
pitch
but
still
though
i
think
you
innocent
of
so
heinous
an
offence
there
is
no
harm
in
asking
why
you
might
not
love
her
and
even
seek
her
for
a
wife
achsa
fielding
my
wife
good
heaven--the
very
sound
threw
my
soul
into
unconquerable
tumults
take
care
my
friend
continued
i
in
beseeching
accents
you
may
do
me
more
injury
than
you
conceive
by
even
starting
such
a
thought
true
said
he
as
long
as
such
obstacles
exist
to
your
success
so
many
incurable
objections
for
instance
she
is
six
years
older
than
you
that
is
an
advantage
her
age
is
what
it
ought
to
be
but
she
has
been
a
wife
and
mother
already
that
is
likewise
an
advantage
she
has
wisdom
because
she
has
experience
her
sensibilities
are
stronger
because
they
have
been
exercised
and
chastened
her
first
marriage
was
unfortunate
the
purer
is
the
felicity
she
will
taste
in
a
second
if
her
second
choice
be
propitious
the
greater
her
tenderness
and
gratitude
but
she
is
a
foreigner
independent
of
control
and
rich
all
which
are
blessings
to
herself
and
to
him
for
whom
her
hand
is
reserved
especially
if
like
me
he
is
indigent
but
then
she
is
unsightly
as
a
night-hag
tawny
as
a
moor
the
eye
of
a
gipsy
low
in
stature
contemptibly
diminutive
scarcely
bulk
enough
to
cast
a
shadow
as
she
walks
less
luxuriance
than
a
charred
log
fewer
elasticities
than
a
sheet
pebble
hush
hush
blasphemer--and
i
put
my
hand
before
his
mouth--have
i
not
told
you
that
in
mind
person
and
condition
she
is
the
type
after
which
my
enamoured
fancy
has
modelled
my
wife
oh
ho
then
the
objection
does
not
lie
with
you
it
lies
with
her
it
seems
she
can
find
nothing
in
you
to
esteem
and
pray
for
what
faults
do
you
think
she
would
reject
you
i
cannot
tell
that
she
can
ever
balance
for
a
moment
on
such
a
question
is
incredible
me
me
that
achsa
fielding
should
think
of
me
incredible
indeed
you
who
are
loathsome
in
your
person
an
idiot
in
your
understanding
a
villain
in
your
morals
deformed
withered
vain
stupid
and
malignant
that
such
a
one
should
choose
you
for
an
idol
pray
my
friend
said
i
anxiously
jest
not
what
mean
you
by
a
hint
of
this
kind
i
will
not
jest
then
but
will
soberly
inquire
what
faults
are
they
which
make
this
lady's
choice
of
you
so
incredible
you
are
younger
than
she
though
no
one
who
merely
observed
your
manners
and
heard
you
talk
would
take
you
to
be
under
thirty
you
are
poor
are
these
impediments
i
should
think
not
i
have
heard
her
reason
with
admirable
eloquence
against
the
vain
distinctions
of
property
and
nation
and
rank
they
were
once
of
moment
in
her
eyes
but
the
sufferings
humiliations
and
reflections
of
years
have
cured
her
of
the
folly
her
nation
has
suffered
too
much
by
the
inhuman
antipathies
of
religious
and
political
faction
she
herself
has
felt
so
often
the
contumelies
of
the
rich
the
high-born
and
the
bigoted
that----
pr'ythee
then
what
dost
imagine
her
objections
to
be
why--i
don't
know
the
thought
was
so
aspiring
to
call
her
my
wife
was
a
height
of
bliss
the
very
far-off
view
of
which
made
my
head
dizzy
a
height
however
to
attain
which
you
suppose
only
her
consent
her
love
to
be
necessary
without
doubt
her
love
is
indispensable
sit
down
arthur
and
let
us
no
longer
treat
this
matter
lightly
i
clearly
see
the
importance
of
this
moment
to
this
lady's
happiness
and
yours
it
is
plain
that
you
love
this
woman
how
could
you
help
it
a
brilliant
skin
is
not
hers
nor
elegant
proportions
nor
majestic
stature
yet
no
creature
had
ever
more
power
to
bewitch
her
manners
have
grace
and
dignity
that
flow
from
exquisite
feelings
delicate
taste
and
the
quickest
and
keenest
penetration
she
has
the
wisdom
of
men
and
of
books
her
sympathies
are
enforced
by
reason
and
her
charities
regulated
by
knowledge
she
has
a
woman's
age
fortune
more
than
you
wish
and
a
spotless
fame
how
could
you
fail
to
love
her
you
who
are
her
chosen
friend
who
partake
her
pleasures
and
share
her
employments
on
whom
she
almost
exclusively
bestows
her
society
and
confidence
and
to
whom
she
thus
affords
the
strongest
of
all
indirect
proofs
of
impassioned
esteem--how
could
you
with
all
that
firmness
of
love
joined
with
all
that
discernment
of
her
excellence
how
could
you
escape
the
enchantment
you
have
not
thought
of
marriage
you
have
not
suspected
your
love
from
the
purity
of
your
mind
from
the
idolatry
with
which
this
woman
has
inspired
you
you
have
imagined
no
delight
beyond
that
of
enjoying
her
society
as
you
now
do
and
have
never
fostered
a
hope
beyond
this
privilege
how
quickly
would
this
tranquillity
vanish
and
the
true
state
of
your
heart
be
evinced
if
a
rival
should
enter
the
scene
and
be
entertained
with
preference
then
would
the
seal
be
removed
the
spell
be
broken
and
you
would
awaken
to
terror
and
to
anguish
of
this
however
there
is
no
danger
your
passion
is
not
felt
by
you
alone
from
her
treatment
of
you
your
diffidence
disables
you
from
seeing
but
nothing
can
be
clearer
to
me
than
that
she
loves
you
i
started
on
my
feet
a
flush
of
scorching
heat
flowed
to
every
part
of
my
frame
my
temples
began
to
throb
like
my
heart
i
was
half
delirious
and
my
delirium
was
strangely
compounded
of
fear
and
hope
of
delight
and
of
terror
what
have
you
done
my
friend
you
have
overturned
my
peace
of
mind
till
now
the
image
of
this
woman
has
been
followed
by
complacency
and
sober
rapture
but
your
words
have
dashed
the
scene
with
dismay
and
confusion
you
have
raised
up
wishes
and
dreams
and
doubts
which
possess
me
in
spite
of
my
reason
in
spite
of
a
thousand
proofs
good
god
you
say
she
loves--loves
me--me
a
boy
in
age
bred
in
clownish
ignorance
scarcely
ushered
into
the
world
more
than
childishly
unlearned
and
raw
a
barn-door
simpleton
a
plough-tail
kitchen-hearth
turnip-hoeing
novice
she
thus
splendidly
endowed
thus
allied
to
nobles
thus
gifted
with
arts
and
adorned
with
graces
that
she
should
choose
me
me
for
the
partner
of
her
fortune
her
affections
and
her
life
it
cannot
be
yet
if
it
were
if
your
guesses
should--prove--oaf
madman
to
indulge
so
fatal
a
chimera
so
rash
a
dream
my
friend
my
friend
i
feel
that
you
have
done
me
an
irreparable
injury
i
can
never
more
look
her
in
the
face
i
can
never
more
frequent
her
society
these
new
thoughts
will
beset
and
torment
me
my
disquiet
will
chain
up
my
tongue
that
overflowing
gratitude
that
innocent
joy
unconscious
of
offence
and
knowing
no
restraint
which
have
hitherto
been
my
titles
to
her
favour
will
fly
from
my
features
and
manners
i
shall
be
anxious
vacant
and
unhappy
in
her
presence
i
shall
dread
to
look
at
her
or
to
open
my
lips
lest
my
mad
and
unhallowed
ambition
should
betray
itself
well
replied
stevens
this
scene
is
quite
new
i
could
almost
find
it
in
my
heart
to
pity
you
i
did
not
expect
this
and
yet
from
my
knowledge
of
your
character
i
ought
perhaps
to
have
foreseen
it
this
is
a
necessary
part
of
the
drama
a
joyous
certainty
on
these
occasions
must
always
be
preceded
by
suspenses
and
doubts
and
the
close
will
be
joyous
in
proportion
as
the
preludes
are
excruciating
go
to
bed
my
good
friend
and
think
of
this
time
and
a
few
more
interviews
with
mrs
fielding
will
i
doubt
not
set
all
to
rights
i
went
to
my
chamber
but
what
different
sensations
did
i
carry
into
it
from
those
with
which
i
had
left
it
a
few
hours
before
i
stretched
myself
on
the
mattress
and
put
out
the
light
but
the
swarm
of
new
images
that
rushed
on
my
mind
set
me
again
instantly
in
motion
all
was
rapid
vague
and
undefined
wearying
and
distracting
my
attention
i
was
roused
as
by
a
divine
voice
that
said
sleep
no
more
mervyn
shall
sleep
no
more
what
chiefly
occupied
me
was
a
nameless
sort
of
terror
what
shall
i
compare
it
to
methinks
that
one
falling
from
a
tree
overhanging
a
torrent
plunged
into
the
whirling
eddy
and
gasping
and
struggling
while
he
sinks
to
rise
no
more
would
feel
just
as
i
did
then
nay
some
such
image
actually
possessed
me
such
was
one
of
my
reveries
in
which
suddenly
i
stretched
my
hand
and
caught
the
arm
of
a
chair
this
act
called
me
back
to
reason
or
rather
gave
my
soul
opportunity
to
roam
into
a
new
track
equally
wild
was
it
the
abruptness
of
this
vision
that
thus
confounded
me
was
it
a
latent
error
in
my
moral
constitution
which
this
new
conjuncture
drew
forth
into
influence
these
were
all
the
tokens
of
a
mind
lost
to
itself
bewildered
unhinged
plunged
into
a
drear
insanity
nothing
less
could
have
prompted
so
fantastically
for
midnight
as
it
was
my
chamber's
solitude
was
not
to
be
supported
after
a
few
turns
across
the
floor
i
left
the
room
and
the
house
i
walked
without
design
and
in
a
hurried
pace
i
posted
straight
to
the
house
of
mrs
fielding
i
lifted
the
latch
but
the
door
did
not
open
it
was
no
doubt
locked
how
comes
this
said
i
and
looked
around
me
the
hour
and
occasion
were
unthought
of
habituated
to
this
path
i
had
taken
it
spontaneously
how
comes
this
repeated
i
locked
upon
me
but
i
will
summon
them
i
warrant
me--and
rung
the
bell
not
timidly
or
slightly
but
with
violence
some
one
hastened
from
above
i
saw
the
glimmer
of
a
candle
through
the
keyhole
strange
thought
i
a
candle
at
noonday--the
door
was
opened
and
my
poor
bess
robed
in
a
careless
and
hasty
manner
appeared
she
started
at
sight
of
me
but
merely
because
she
did
not
in
a
moment
recognise
me--ah
arthur
is
it
you
come
in
my
mamma
has
wanted
you
these
two
hours
i
was
just
going
to
despatch
philip
to
tell
you
to
come
lead
me
to
her
said
i
she
led
the
way
into
the
parlour--wait
a
moment
here
i
will
tell
her
you
are
come--and
she
tripped
away
presently
a
step
was
heard
the
door
opened
again
and
then
entered
a
man
he
was
tall
elegant
sedate
to
a
degree
of
sadness
something
in
his
dress
and
aspect
that
bespoke
the
foreigner
the
frenchman
what
said
he
mildly
is
your
business
with
my
wife
she
cannot
see
you
instantly
and
has
sent
me
to
receive
your
commands
your
wife
i
want
mrs
fielding
true
and
mrs
fielding
is
my
wife
thank
heaven
i
have
come
in
time
to
discover
her
and
claim
her
as
such
i
started
back
i
shuddered
my
joints
slackened
and
i
stretched
my
hand
to
catch
something
by
which
i
might
be
saved
from
sinking
on
the
floor
meanwhile
fielding
changed
his
countenance
into
rage
and
fury
he
called
me
villain
bade
me
avaunt
and
drew
a
shining
steel
from
his
bosom
with
which
he
stabbed
me
to
the
heart
i
sunk
upon
the
floor
and
all
for
a
time
was
darkness
and
oblivion
at
length
i
returned
as
it
were
to
life
i
opened
my
eyes
the
mists
disappeared
and
i
found
myself
stretched
upon
the
bed
in
my
own
chamber
i
remembered
the
fatal
blow
i
had
received
i
put
my
hand
upon
my
breast
the
spot
where
the
dagger
entered
there
were
no
traces
of
a
wound
all
was
perfect
and
entire
some
miracle
had
made
me
whole
i
raised
myself
up
i
re-examined
my
body
all
around
me
was
hushed
till
a
voice
from
the
pavement
below
proclaimed
that
it
was
past
three
o'clock
what
said
i
has
all
this
miserable
pageantry
this
midnight
wandering
and
this
ominous
interview
been
no
more
than--a
dream
it
may
be
proper
to
mention
in
explanation
of
this
scene
and
to
show
the
thorough
perturbation
of
my
mind
during
this
night
intelligence
gained
some
days
after
from
eliza
she
said
that
about
two
o'clock
on
this
night
she
was
roused
by
a
violent
ringing
of
the
bell
she
was
startled
by
so
unseasonable
a
summons
she
slept
in
a
chamber
adjoining
mrs
fielding's
and
hesitated
whether
she
should
alarm
her
friend
but
the
summons
not
being
repeated
she
had
determined
to
forbear
added
to
this
was
the
report
of
mrs
stevens
who
on
the
same
night
about
half
an
hour
after
i
and
her
husband
had
retired
imagined
that
she
heard
the
street
door
opened
and
shut
but
this
being
followed
by
no
other
consequence
she
supposed
herself
mistaken
i
have
little
doubt
that
in
my
feverish
and
troubled
sleep
i
actually
went
forth
posted
to
the
house
of
mrs
fielding
rung
for
admission
and
shortly
after
returned
to
my
own
apartment
this
confusion
of
mind
was
somewhat
allayed
by
the
return
of
light
it
gave
way
to
more
uniform
but
not
less
rueful
and
despondent
perceptions
the
image
of
achsa
filled
my
fancy
but
it
was
the
harbinger
of
nothing
but
humiliation
and
sorrow
to
outroot
the
conviction
of
my
own
unworthiness
to
persuade
myself
that
i
was
regarded
with
the
tenderness
that
stevens
had
ascribed
to
her
that
the
discovery
of
my
thoughts
would
not
excite
her
anger
and
grief
i
felt
to
be
impossible
in
this
state
of
mind
i
could
not
see
her
to
declare
my
feelings
would
produce
indignation
and
anguish
to
hide
them
from
her
scrutiny
was
not
in
my
power
yet
what
would
she
think
of
my
estranging
myself
from
her
society
what
expedient
could
i
honestly
adopt
to
justify
my
absence
and
what
employments
could
i
substitute
for
those
precious
hours
hitherto
devoted
to
her
this
afternoon
thought
i
she
has
been
invited
to
spend
at
stedman's
country-house
on
schuylkill
she
consented
to
go
and
i
was
to
accompany
her
i
am
fit
only
for
solitude
my
behaviour
in
her
presence
will
be
enigmatical
capricious
and
morose
i
must
not
go
yet
what
will
she
think
of
my
failure
not
to
go
will
be
injurious
and
suspicious
i
was
undetermined
the
appointed
hour
arrived
i
stood
at
my
chamber-window
torn
by
a
variety
of
purposes
and
swayed
alternately
by
repugnant
arguments
i
several
times
went
to
the
door
of
my
apartment
and
put
my
foot
upon
the
first
step
of
the
staircase
but
as
often
paused
reconsidered
and
returned
to
my
room
in
these
fluctuations
the
hour
passed
no
messenger
arrived
from
mrs
fielding
inquiring
into
the
cause
of
my
delay
was
she
offended
at
my
negligence
was
she
sick
and
disabled
from
going
or
had
she
changed
her
mind
i
now
remembered
her
parting
words
at
our
last
interview
were
they
not
susceptible
of
two
constructions
she
said
my
visit
was
too
long
and
bade
me
begone
did
she
suspect
my
presumption
and
is
she
determined
thus
to
punish
me
this
terror
added
anew
to
all
my
former
anxieties
it
was
impossible
to
rest
in
this
suspense
i
would
go
to
her
i
would
lay
before
her
all
the
anguish
of
my
heart
i
would
not
spare
myself
she
shall
not
reproach
me
more
severely
than
i
will
reproach
myself
i
will
hear
my
sentence
from
her
own
lips
and
promise
unlimited
submission
to
the
doom
of
separation
and
exile
which
she
will
pronounce
i
went
forth
to
her
house
the
drawing-room
and
summer-house
were
empty
i
summoned
philip
the
footman
his
mistress
was
gone
to
mr
stedman's
how--to
stedman's--in
whose
company
miss
stedman
and
her
brother
called
for
her
in
the
carriage
and
persuaded
her
to
go
with
them
now
my
heart
sunk
indeed
miss
stedman's
brother
a
youth
forward
gallant
and
gay
flushed
with
prosperity
and
just
returned
from
europe
with
all
the
confidence
of
age
and
all
the
ornaments
of
education
she
has
gone
with
him
though
pre-engaged
to
me
poor
arthur
how
art
thou
despised
this
information
only
heightened
my
impatience
i
went
away
but
returned
in
the
evening
i
waited
till
eleven
but
she
came
not
back
i
cannot
justly
paint
the
interval
that
passed
till
next
morning
it
was
void
of
sleep
on
leaving
her
house
i
wandered
into
the
fields
every
moment
increased
my
impatience
she
will
probably
spend
the
morrow
at
stedman's
said
i
and
possibly
the
next
day
why
should
i
wait
for
her
return
why
not
seek
her
there
and
rid
myself
at
once
of
this
agonizing
suspense
why
not
go
thither
now
this
night
wherever
i
spend
it
will
be
unacquainted
with
repose
i
will
go
it
is
already
near
twelve
and
the
distance
is
more
than
eight
miles
i
will
hover
near
the
house
till
morning
and
then
as
early
as
possible
demand
an
interview
i
was
well
acquainted
with
stedman's
villa
having
formerly
been
there
with
mrs
fielding
i
quickly
entered
its
precincts
i
went
close
to
the
house
looked
mournfully
at
every
window
at
one
of
them
a
light
was
to
be
seen
and
i
took
various
stations
to
discover
if
possible
the
persons
within
methought
once
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
female
whom
my
fancy
easily
imagined
to
be
achsa
i
sat
down
upon
the
lawn
some
hundred
feet
from
the
house
and
opposite
the
window
whence
the
light
proceeded
i
watched
it
till
at
length
some
one
came
to
the
window
lifted
it
and
leaning
on
her
arms
continued
to
look
out
the
preceding
day
had
been
a
very
sultry
one
the
night
as
usual
after
such
a
day
and
the
fall
of
a
violent
shower
was
delightfully
serene
and
pleasant
where
i
stood
was
enlightened
by
the
moon
whether
she
saw
me
or
not
i
could
hardly
tell
or
whether
she
distinguished
any
thing
but
a
human
figure
without
reflecting
on
what
was
due
to
decorum
and
punctilio
i
immediately
drew
near
the
house
i
quickly
perceived
that
her
attention
was
fixed
neither
of
us
spoke
till
i
had
placed
myself
directly
under
her
i
then
opened
my
lips
without
knowing
in
what
manner
to
address
her
she
spoke
first
and
in
a
startled
and
anxious
voice--
who
is
that
arthur
mervyn
he
that
was
two
days
ago
your
friend
mervyn
what
is
it
that
brings
you
here
at
this
hour
what
is
the
matter
what
has
happened
is
anybody
sick
all
is
safe
all
are
in
good
health
what
then
do
you
come
hither
for
at
such
an
hour
i
meant
not
to
disturb
you
i
meant
not
to
be
seen
good
heavens
how
you
frighten
me
what
can
be
the
reason
of
so
strange----
be
not
alarmed
i
meant
to
hover
near
the
house
till
morning
that
i
might
see
you
as
early
as
possible
for
what
purpose
i
will
tell
you
when
we
meet
and
let
that
be
at
five
o'clock
the
sun
will
then
be
risen
in
the
cedar-grove
under
the
bank
till
when
farewell
having
said
this
i
prevented
all
expostulation
by
turning
the
angle
of
the
house
and
hastening
towards
the
shore
of
the
river
i
roved
about
the
grove
that
i
have
mentioned
in
one
part
of
it
is
a
rustic
seat
and
table
shrouded
by
trees
and
shrubs
and
an
intervening
eminence
from
the
view
of
those
in
the
house
this
i
designed
to
be
the
closing
scene
of
my
destiny
presently
i
left
this
spot
and
wandered
upward
through
embarrassed
and
obscure
paths
starting
forward
or
checking
my
pace
according
as
my
wayward
meditations
governed
me
shall
i
describe
my
thoughts
impossible
it
was
certainly
a
temporary
loss
of
reason
nothing
less
than
madness
could
lead
into
such
devious
tracks
drag
me
down
to
so
hopeless
helpless
panicful
a
depth
and
drag
me
down
so
suddenly
lay
waste
as
at
a
signal
all
my
flourishing
structures
and
reduce
them
in
a
moment
to
a
scene
of
confusion
and
horror
what
did
i
fear
what
did
i
hope
what
did
i
design
i
cannot
tell
my
glooms
were
to
retire
with
the
night
the
point
to
which
every
tumultuous
feeling
was
linked
was
the
coming
interview
with
achsa
that
was
the
boundary
of
fluctuation
and
suspense
here
was
the
sealing
and
ratification
of
my
doom
i
rent
a
passage
through
the
thicket
and
struggled
upward
till
i
reached
the
edge
of
a
considerable
precipice
i
laid
me
down
at
my
length
upon
the
rock
whose
cold
and
hard
surface
i
pressed
with
my
bared
and
throbbing
breast
i
leaned
over
the
edge
fixed
my
eyes
upon
the
water
and
wept--plentifully
but
why
may
this
be
my
heart's
last
beat
if
i
can
tell
why
i
had
wandered
so
far
from
stedman's
that
when
roused
by
the
light
i
had
some
miles
to
walk
before
i
could
reach
the
place
of
meeting
achsa
was
already
there
i
slid
down
the
rock
above
and
appeared
before
her
well
might
she
be
startled
at
my
wild
and
abrupt
appearance
i
placed
myself
without
uttering
a
word
upon
a
seat
opposite
to
her
the
table
between
and
crossing
my
arms
upon
the
table
leaned
my
head
upon
them
while
my
face
was
turned
towards
and
my
eyes
fixed
upon
hers
i
seemed
to
have
lost
the
power
and
the
inclination
to
speak
she
regarded
me
at
first
with
anxious
curiosity
after
examining
my
looks
every
emotion
was
swallowed
up
in
terrified
sorrow
for
god's
sake--what
does
all
this
mean
why
am
i
called
to
this
place
what
tidings
what
fearful
tidings
do
you
bring
i
did
not
change
my
posture
or
speak
what
she
resumed
could
inspire
all
this
woe
keep
me
not
in
this
suspense
arthur
these
looks
and
this
silence
shock
and
afflict
me
too
much
afflict
you
said
i
at
last
i
come
to
tell
you
what
now
that
i
am
here
i
cannot
tell----
there
i
stopped
say
what
i
entreat
you
you
seem
to
be
very
unhappy--such
a
change--from
yesterday
yes
from
yesterday
all
then
was
a
joyous
calm
and
now
all
is--but
then
i
knew
not
my
infamy
my
guilt----
what
words
are
these
and
from
you
arthur
guilt
is
to
you
impossible
if
purity
is
to
be
found
on
earth
it
is
lodged
in
your
heart
what
have
you
done
i
have
dared--how
little
you
expect
the
extent
of
my
daring
that
such
as
i
should
look
upwards
with
this
ambition
i
stood
up
and
taking
her
hands
in
mine
as
she
sat
looked
earnestly
in
her
face--i
come
only
to
beseech
your
pardon
to
tell
you
my
crime
and
then
disappear
forever
but
first
let
me
see
if
there
be
any
omen
of
forgiveness
your
looks--they
are
kind
heavenly
compassionate
still
i
will
trust
them
i
believe
and
yet
letting
go
her
hands
and
turning
away
this
offence
is
beyond
the
reach
even
of
your
mercy
how
beyond
measure
these
words
and
this
deportment
distress
me
let
me
know
the
worst
i
cannot
bear
to
be
thus
perplexed
why
said
i
turning
quickly
round
and
again
taking
her
hands
that
mervyn
whom
you
have
honoured
and
confided
in
and
blessed
with
your
sweet
regards
has
been----
what
has
he
been
divinely
amiable
heroic
in
his
virtue
i
am
sure
what
else
has
he
been
this
mervyn
has
imagined
has
dared--will
you
forgive
him
forgive
you
what
why
don't
you
speak
keep
not
my
soul
in
this
suspense
he
has
dared--but
do
not
think
that
i
am
he
continue
to
look
as
now
and
reserve
your
killing
glances
the
vengeance
of
those
eyes
as
for
one
that
is
absent----why
what--you
weep
then
at
last
that
is
a
propitious
sign
when
pity
drops
from
the
eyes
of
our
judge
then
should
the
suppliant
approach
now
in
confidence
of
pardon
i
will
tell
you
this
mervyn
not
content
with
all
you
have
hitherto
granted
him
has
dared--to
love
you
nay
to
think
of
you
as
of
his
wife
her
eye
sunk
beneath
mine
and
disengaging
her
hands
she
covered
her
face
with
them
i
see
my
fate
said
i
in
a
tone
of
despair
too
well
did
i
predict
the
effect
of
this
confession
but
i
will
go--and
unforgiven
she
now
partly
uncovered
her
face
the
hand
was
withdrawn
from
her
cheek
and
stretched
towards
me
she
looked
at
me
arthur
i
do
forgive
thee--with
what
accents
was
this
uttered
with
what
looks
the
cheek
that
was
before
pale
with
terror
was
now
crimsoned
over
by
a
different
emotion
and
delight
swam
in
her
eye
could
i
mistake
my
doubts
my
new-born
fears
made
me
tremble
while
i
took
the
offered
hand
surely
faltered
i
i
am
not--i
cannot
be--so
blessed
there
was
no
need
of
words
the
hand
that
i
held
was
sufficiently
eloquent
she
was
still
silent
surely
said
i
my
senses
deceive
me
a
bliss
like
this
cannot
be
reserved
for
me
tell
me
once
more--set
my
doubting
heart
at
rest
she
now
gave
herself
to
my
arms--i
have
not
words--let
your
own
heart
tell
you
you
have
made
your
achsa----
at
this
moment
a
voice
from
without
it
was
miss
stedman's
called
mrs
fielding
where
are
you
my
friend
started
up
and
in
a
hasty
voice
bade
me
begone
you
must
not
be
seen
by
this
giddy
girl
come
hither
this
evening
as
if
by
my
appointment
and
i
will
return
with
you--she
left
me
in
a
kind
of
trance
i
was
immovable
my
reverie
was
too
delicious--but
let
me
not
attempt
the
picture
if
i
can
convey
no
image
of
my
state
previous
to
this
interview
my
subsequent
feelings
are
still
more
beyond
the
reach
of
my
powers
to
describe
agreeably
to
the
commands
of
my
mistress
i
hastened
away
evading
paths
which
might
expose
me
to
observation
i
speedily
made
my
friends
partake
of
my
joy
and
passed
the
day
in
a
state
of
solemn
but
confused
rapture
i
did
not
accurately
portray
the
various
parts
of
my
felicity
the
whole
rushed
upon
my
soul
at
once
my
conceptions
were
too
rapid
and
too
comprehensive
to
be
distinct
i
went
to
stedman's
in
the
evening
i
found
in
the
accents
and
looks
of
my
achsa
new
assurances
that
all
which
had
lately
passed
was
more
than
a
dream
she
made
excuses
for
leaving
the
stedmans
sooner
than
ordinary
and
was
accompanied
to
the
city
by
her
friend
we
dropped
mrs
fielding
at
her
own
house
and
thither
after
accompanying
miss
stedman
to
her
own
home
i
returned
upon
the
wings
of
tremulous
impatience
now
could
i
repeat
every
word
of
every
conversation
that
has
since
taken
place
between
us
but
why
should
i
do
that
on
paper
indeed
it
could
not
be
done
all
is
of
equal
value
and
all
could
not
be
comprised
but
in
many
volumes
there
needs
nothing
more
deeply
to
imprint
it
on
my
memory
and
while
thus
reviewing
the
past
i
should
be
iniquitously
neglecting
the
present
what
is
given
to
the
pen
would
be
taken
from
her
and
that
indeed
would
be--but
no
need
of
saying
what
it
would
be
since
it
is
impossible
i
merely
write
to
allay
these
tumults
which
our
necessary
separation
produces
to
aid
me
in
calling
up
a
little
patience
till
the
time
arrives
when
our
persons
like
our
minds
shall
be
united
forever
that
time--may
nothing
happen
to
prevent--but
nothing
can
happen
but
why
this
ominous
misgiving
just
now
my
love
has
infected
me
with
these
unworthy
terrors
for
she
has
them
too
this
morning
i
was
relating
my
dream
to
her
she
started
and
grew
pale
a
sad
silence
ensued
the
cheerfulness
that
had
reigned
before--why
thus
dejected
my
friend
i
hate
your
dream
it
is
a
horrid
thought
would
to
god
it
had
never
occurred
to
you
why
surely
you
place
no
confidence
in
dreams
i
know
not
where
to
place
confidence
not
in
my
present
promises
of
joy--and
she
wept
i
endeavoured
to
soothe
or
console
her
why
i
asked
did
she
weep
my
heart
is
sore
former
disappointments
were
so
heavy
the
hopes
which
were
blasted
were
so
like
my
present
ones
that
the
dread
of
a
like
result
will
intrude
upon
my
thoughts
and
now
your
dream
indeed
i
know
not
what
to
do
i
believe
i
ought
still
to
retract--ought
at
least
to
postpone
an
act
so
irrevocable
now
was
i
obliged
again
to
go
over
my
catalogue
of
arguments
to
induce
her
to
confirm
her
propitious
resolution
to
be
mine
within
the
week
i
at
last
succeeded
even
in
restoring
her
serenity
and
beguiling
her
fears
by
dwelling
on
our
future
happiness
our
household
while
we
stayed
in
america--in
a
year
or
two
we
hie
to
europe--should
be
thus
composed
fidelity
and
skill
and
pure
morals
should
be
sought
out
and
enticed
by
generous
recompenses
into
our
domestic
service
duties
which
should
be
light
and
regular--such
and
such
should
be
our
amusements
and
employments
abroad
and
at
home
and
would
not
this
be
true
happiness
oh
yes--if
it
may
be
so
it
shall
be
so
but
this
is
but
the
humble
outline
of
the
scene
something
is
still
to
be
added
to
complete
our
felicity
what
more
can
be
added
what
more
can
achsa
ask
what
more
she
who
has
not
been
only
a
wife----
but
why
am
i
indulging
this
pen-prattle
the
hour
she
fixed
for
my
return
to
her
is
come
and
now
take
thyself
away
quill
lie
there
snug
in
thy
leathern
case
till
i
call
for
thee
and
that
will
not
be
very
soon
i
believe
i
will
abjure
thy
company
till
all
is
settled
with
my
love
yes
i
will
abjure
thee
so
let
this
be
thy
last
office
till
mervyn
has
been
made
the
happiest
of
men

end
