st
bertrand
de
comminges
is
a
decayed
town
on
the
spurs
of
the
pyrenees
not
very
far
from
toulouse
and
still
nearer
to
bagnã¨res-de-luchon
it
was
the
site
of
a
bishopric
until
the
revolution
and
has
a
cathedral
which
is
visited
by
a
certain
number
of
tourists
in
the
spring
of
1883
an
englishman
arrived
at
this
old-world
place--i
can
hardly
dignify
it
with
the
name
of
city
for
there
are
not
a
thousand
inhabitants
he
was
a
cambridge
man
who
had
come
specially
from
toulouse
to
see
st
bertrand's
church
and
had
left
two
friends
who
were
less
keen
archaeologists
than
himself
in
their
hotel
at
toulouse
under
promise
to
join
him
on
the
following
morning
half
an
hour
at
the
church
would
satisfy
them
and
all
three
could
then
pursue
their
journey
in
the
direction
of
auch
but
our
englishman
had
come
early
on
the
day
in
question
and
proposed
to
himself
to
fill
a
note-book
and
to
use
several
dozens
of
plates
in
the
process
of
describing
and
photographing
every
corner
of
the
wonderful
church
that
dominates
the
little
hill
of
comminges
in
order
to
carry
out
this
design
satisfactorily
it
was
necessary
to
monopolize
the
verger
of
the
church
for
the
day
the
verger
or
sacristan
i
prefer
the
latter
appellation
inaccurate
as
it
may
be
was
accordingly
sent
for
by
the
somewhat
brusque
lady
who
keeps
the
inn
of
the
chapeau
rouge
and
when
he
came
the
englishman
found
him
an
unexpectedly
interesting
object
of
study
it
was
not
in
the
personal
appearance
of
the
little
dry
wizened
old
man
that
the
interest
lay
for
he
was
precisely
like
dozens
of
other
church-guardians
in
france
but
in
a
curious
furtive
or
rather
hunted
and
oppressed
air
which
he
had
he
was
perpetually
half
glancing
behind
him
the
muscles
of
his
back
and
shoulders
seemed
to
be
hunched
in
a
continual
nervous
contraction
as
if
he
were
expecting
every
moment
to
find
himself
in
the
clutch
of
an
enemy
the
englishman
hardly
knew
whether
to
put
him
down
as
a
man
haunted
by
a
fixed
delusion
or
as
one
oppressed
by
a
guilty
conscience
or
as
an
unbearably
henpecked
husband
the
probabilities
when
reckoned
up
certainly
pointed
to
the
last
idea
but
still
the
impression
conveyed
was
that
of
a
more
formidable
persecutor
even
than
a
termagant
wife
however
the
englishman
let
us
call
him
dennistoun
was
soon
too
deep
in
his
note-book
and
too
busy
with
his
camera
to
give
more
than
an
occasional
glance
to
the
sacristan
whenever
he
did
look
at
him
he
found
him
at
no
great
distance
either
huddling
himself
back
against
the
wall
or
crouching
in
one
of
the
gorgeous
stalls
dennistoun
became
rather
fidgety
after
a
time
mingled
suspicions
that
he
was
keeping
the
old
man
from
his
dã©jeuner
that
he
was
regarded
as
likely
to
make
away
with
st
bertrand's
ivory
crozier
or
with
the
dusty
stuffed
crocodile
that
hangs
over
the
font
began
to
torment
him
'won't
you
go
home'
he
said
at
last
'i'm
quite
well
able
to
finish
my
notes
alone
you
can
lock
me
in
if
you
like
i
shall
want
at
least
two
hours
more
here
and
it
must
be
cold
for
you
isn't
it'
'good
heavens'
said
the
little
man
whom
the
suggestion
seemed
to
throw
into
a
state
of
unaccountable
terror
'such
a
thing
cannot
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
leave
monsieur
alone
in
the
church
no
no
two
hours
three
hours
all
will
be
the
same
to
me
i
have
breakfasted
i
am
not
at
all
cold
with
many
thanks
to
monsieur'
'very
well
my
little
man'
quoth
dennistoun
to
himself
'you
have
been
warned
and
you
must
take
the
consequences'
before
the
expiration
of
the
two
hours
the
stalls
the
enormous
dilapidated
organ
the
choir-screen
of
bishop
john
de
maulã©on
the
remnants
of
glass
and
tapestry
and
the
objects
in
the
treasure-chamber
had
been
well
and
truly
examined
the
sacristan
still
keeping
at
dennistoun's
heels
and
every
now
and
then
whipping
round
as
if
he
had
been
stung
when
one
or
other
of
the
strange
noises
that
trouble
a
large
empty
building
fell
on
his
ear
curious
noises
they
were
sometimes
'once'
dennistoun
said
to
me
'i
could
have
sworn
i
heard
a
thin
metallic
voice
laughing
high
up
in
the
tower
i
darted
an
inquiring
glance
at
my
sacristan
he
was
white
to
the
lips
it
is
he--that
is--it
is
no
one
the
door
is
locked
was
all
he
said
and
we
looked
at
each
other
for
a
full
minute'
another
little
incident
puzzled
dennistoun
a
good
deal
he
was
examining
a
large
dark
picture
that
hangs
behind
the
altar
one
of
a
series
illustrating
the
miracles
of
st
bertrand
the
composition
of
the
picture
is
well-nigh
indecipherable
but
there
is
a
latin
legend
below
which
runs
thus
qualiter
s
bertrandus
liberavit
hominem
quem
diabolus
diu
volebat
strangulare
how
st
bertrand
delivered
a
man
whom
the
devil
long
sought
to
strangle
dennistoun
was
turning
to
the
sacristan
with
a
smile
and
a
jocular
remark
of
some
sort
on
his
lips
but
he
was
confounded
to
see
the
old
man
on
his
knees
gazing
at
the
picture
with
the
eye
of
a
suppliant
in
agony
his
hands
tightly
clasped
and
a
rain
of
tears
on
his
cheeks
dennistoun
naturally
pretended
to
have
noticed
nothing
but
the
question
would
not
go
away
from
him'why
should
a
daub
of
this
kind
affect
anyone
so
strongly'
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
getting
some
sort
of
clue
to
the
reason
of
the
strange
look
that
had
been
puzzling
him
all
the
day
the
man
must
be
a
monomaniac
but
what
was
his
monomania
it
was
nearly
five
o'clock
the
short
day
was
drawing
in
and
the
church
began
to
fill
with
shadows
while
the
curious
noises--the
muffled
footfalls
and
distant
talking
voices
that
had
been
perceptible
all
day--seemed
no
doubt
because
of
the
fading
light
and
the
consequently
quickened
sense
of
hearing
to
become
more
frequent
and
insistent
the
sacristan
began
for
the
first
time
to
show
signs
of
hurry
and
impatience
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
camera
and
note-book
were
finally
packed
up
and
stowed
away
and
hurriedly
beckoned
dennistoun
to
the
western
door
of
the
church
under
the
tower
it
was
time
to
ring
the
angelus
a
few
pulls
at
the
reluctant
rope
and
the
great
bell
bertrande
high
in
the
tower
began
to
speak
and
swung
her
voice
up
among
the
pines
and
down
to
the
valleys
loud
with
mountain-streams
calling
the
dwellers
on
those
lonely
hills
to
remember
and
repeat
the
salutation
of
the
angel
to
her
whom
he
called
blessed
among
women
with
that
a
profound
quiet
seemed
to
fall
for
the
first
time
that
day
upon
the
little
town
and
dennistoun
and
the
sacristan
went
out
of
the
church
on
the
doorstep
they
fell
into
conversation
'monsieur
seemed
to
interest
himself
in
the
old
choir-books
in
the
sacristy'
'undoubtedly
i
was
going
to
ask
you
if
there
were
a
library
in
the
town'
'no
monsieur
perhaps
there
used
to
be
one
belonging
to
the
chapter
but
it
is
now
such
a
small
place--'
here
came
a
strange
pause
of
irresolution
as
it
seemed
then
with
a
sort
of
plunge
he
went
on
'but
if
monsieur
is
amateur
des
vieux
livres
i
have
at
home
something
that
might
interest
him
it
is
not
a
hundred
yards'
at
once
all
dennistoun's
cherished
dreams
of
finding
priceless
manuscripts
in
untrodden
corners
of
france
flashed
up
to
die
down
again
the
next
moment
it
was
probably
a
stupid
missal
of
plantin's
printing
about
1580
where
was
the
likelihood
that
a
place
so
near
toulouse
would
not
have
been
ransacked
long
ago
by
collectors
however
it
would
be
foolish
not
to
go
he
would
reproach
himself
for
ever
after
if
he
refused
so
they
set
off
on
the
way
the
curious
irresolution
and
sudden
determination
of
the
sacristan
recurred
to
dennistoun
and
he
wondered
in
a
shamefaced
way
whether
he
was
being
decoyed
into
some
purlieu
to
be
made
away
with
as
a
supposed
rich
englishman
he
contrived
therefore
to
begin
talking
with
his
guide
and
to
drag
in
in
a
rather
clumsy
fashion
the
fact
that
he
expected
two
friends
to
join
him
early
the
next
morning
to
his
surprise
the
announcement
seemed
to
relieve
the
sacristan
at
once
of
some
of
the
anxiety
that
oppressed
him
'that
is
well'
he
said
quite
brightly--'that
is
very
well
monsieur
will
travel
in
company
with
his
friends
they
will
be
always
near
him
it
is
a
good
thing
to
travel
thus
in
company--sometimes'
the
last
word
appeared
to
be
added
as
an
afterthought
and
to
bring
with
it
a
relapse
into
gloom
for
the
poor
little
man
they
were
soon
at
the
house
which
was
one
rather
larger
than
its
neighbours
stone-built
with
a
shield
carved
over
the
door
the
shield
of
alberic
de
maulã©on
a
collateral
descendant
dennistoun
tells
me
of
bishop
john
de
maulã©on
this
alberic
was
a
canon
of
comminges
from
1680
to
1701
the
upper
windows
of
the
mansion
were
boarded
up
and
the
whole
place
bore
as
does
the
rest
of
comminges
the
aspect
of
decaying
age
arrived
on
his
doorstep
the
sacristan
paused
a
moment
'perhaps'
he
said
'perhaps
after
all
monsieur
has
not
the
time'
'not
at
all--lots
of
time--nothing
to
do
till
tomorrow
let
us
see
what
it
is
you
have
got'
the
door
was
opened
at
this
point
and
a
face
looked
out
a
face
far
younger
than
the
sacristan's
but
bearing
something
of
the
same
distressing
look
only
here
it
seemed
to
be
the
mark
not
so
much
of
fear
for
personal
safety
as
of
acute
anxiety
on
behalf
of
another
plainly
the
owner
of
the
face
was
the
sacristan's
daughter
and
but
for
the
expression
i
have
described
she
was
a
handsome
girl
enough
she
brightened
up
considerably
on
seeing
her
father
accompanied
by
an
able-bodied
stranger
a
few
remarks
passed
between
father
and
daughter
of
which
dennistoun
only
caught
these
words
said
by
the
sacristan
'he
was
laughing
in
the
church'
words
which
were
answered
only
by
a
look
of
terror
from
the
girl
but
in
another
minute
they
were
in
the
sitting-room
of
the
house
a
small
high
chamber
with
a
stone
floor
full
of
moving
shadows
cast
by
a
wood-fire
that
flickered
on
a
great
hearth
something
of
the
character
of
an
oratory
was
imparted
to
it
by
a
tall
crucifix
which
reached
almost
to
the
ceiling
on
one
side
the
figure
was
painted
of
the
natural
colours
the
cross
was
black
under
this
stood
a
chest
of
some
age
and
solidity
and
when
a
lamp
had
been
brought
and
chairs
set
the
sacristan
went
to
this
chest
and
produced
therefrom
with
growing
excitement
and
nervousness
as
dennistoun
thought
a
large
book
wrapped
in
a
white
cloth
on
which
cloth
a
cross
was
rudely
embroidered
in
red
thread
even
before
the
wrapping
had
been
removed
dennistoun
began
to
be
interested
by
the
size
and
shape
of
the
volume
'too
large
for
a
missal'
he
thought
'and
not
the
shape
of
an
antiphoner
perhaps
it
may
be
something
good
after
all'
the
next
moment
the
book
was
open
and
dennistoun
felt
that
he
had
at
last
lit
upon
something
better
than
good
before
him
lay
a
large
folio
bound
perhaps
late
in
the
seventeenth
century
with
the
arms
of
canon
alberic
de
maulã©on
stamped
in
gold
on
the
sides
there
may
have
been
a
hundred
and
fifty
leaves
of
paper
in
the
book
and
on
almost
every
one
of
them
was
fastened
a
leaf
from
an
illuminated
manuscript
such
a
collection
dennistoun
had
hardly
dreamed
of
in
his
wildest
moments
here
were
ten
leaves
from
a
copy
of
genesis
illustrated
with
pictures
which
could
not
be
later
than
ad
700
further
on
was
a
complete
set
of
pictures
from
a
psalter
of
english
execution
of
the
very
finest
kind
that
the
thirteenth
century
could
produce
and
perhaps
best
of
all
there
were
twenty
leaves
of
uncial
writing
in
latin
which
as
a
few
words
seen
here
and
there
told
him
at
once
must
belong
to
some
very
early
unknown
patristic
treatise
could
it
possibly
be
a
fragment
of
the
copy
of
papias
'on
the
words
of
our
lord'
which
was
known
to
have
existed
as
late
as
the
twelfth
century
at
nimes1
in
any
case
his
mind
was
made
up
that
book
must
return
to
cambridge
with
him
even
if
he
had
to
draw
the
whole
of
his
balance
from
the
bank
and
stay
at
st
bertrand
till
the
money
came
he
glanced
up
at
the
sacristan
to
see
if
his
face
yielded
any
hint
that
the
book
was
for
sale
the
sacristan
was
pale
and
his
lips
were
working
1
we
now
know
that
these
leaves
did
contain
a
considerable
fragment
of
that
work
if
not
of
that
actual
copy
of
it
'if
monsieur
will
turn
on
to
the
end'
he
said
so
monsieur
turned
on
meeting
new
treasures
at
every
rise
of
a
leaf
and
at
the
end
of
the
book
he
came
upon
two
sheets
of
paper
of
much
more
recent
date
than
anything
he
had
seen
yet
which
puzzled
him
considerably
they
must
be
contemporary
he
decided
with
the
unprincipled
canon
alberic
who
had
doubtless
plundered
the
chapter
library
of
st
bertrand
to
form
this
priceless
scrap-book
on
the
first
of
the
paper
sheets
was
a
plan
carefully
drawn
and
instantly
recognizable
by
a
person
who
knew
the
ground
of
the
south
aisle
and
cloisters
of
st
bertrand's
there
were
curious
signs
looking
like
planetary
symbols
and
a
few
hebrew
words
in
the
corners
and
in
the
north-west
angle
of
the
cloister
was
a
cross
drawn
in
gold
paint
below
the
plan
were
some
lines
of
writing
in
latin
which
ran
thus

'a
good
specimen
of
the
treasure-hunter's
record--quite
reminds
one
of
mr
minor-canon
quatremain
in
old
st
paul's'
was
dennistoun's
comment
and
he
turned
the
leaf
what
he
then
saw
impressed
him
as
he
has
often
told
me
more
than
he
could
have
conceived
any
drawing
or
picture
capable
of
impressing
him
and
though
the
drawing
he
saw
is
no
longer
in
existence
there
is
a
photograph
of
it
which
i
possess
which
fully
bears
out
that
statement
the
picture
in
question
was
a
sepia
drawing
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
representing
one
would
say
at
first
sight
a
biblical
scene
for
the
architecture
the
picture
represented
an
interior
and
the
figures
had
that
semi-classical
flavour
about
them
which
the
artists
of
two
hundred
years
ago
thought
appropriate
to
illustrations
of
the
bible
on
the
right
was
a
king
on
his
throne
the
throne
elevated
on
twelve
steps
a
canopy
overhead
soldiers
on
either
side--evidently
king
solomon
he
was
bending
forward
with
outstretched
sceptre
in
attitude
of
command
his
face
expressed
horror
and
disgust
yet
there
was
in
it
also
the
mark
of
imperious
command
and
confident
power
the
left
half
of
the
picture
was
the
strangest
however
the
interest
plainly
centred
there
on
the
pavement
before
the
throne
were
grouped
four
soldiers
surrounding
a
crouching
figure
which
must
be
described
in
a
moment
a
fifth
soldier
lay
dead
on
the
pavement
his
neck
distorted
and
his
eye-balls
starting
from
his
head
the
four
surrounding
guards
were
looking
at
the
king
in
their
faces
the
sentiment
of
horror
was
intensified
they
seemed
in
fact
only
restrained
from
flight
by
their
implicit
trust
in
their
master
all
this
terror
was
plainly
excited
by
the
being
that
crouched
in
their
midst
i
entirely
despair
of
conveying
by
any
words
the
impression
which
this
figure
makes
upon
anyone
who
looks
at
it
i
recollect
once
showing
the
photograph
of
the
drawing
to
a
lecturer
on
morphology--a
person
of
i
was
going
to
say
abnormally
sane
and
unimaginative
habits
of
mind
he
absolutely
refused
to
be
alone
for
the
rest
of
that
evening
and
he
told
me
afterwards
that
for
many
nights
he
had
not
dared
to
put
out
his
light
before
going
to
sleep
however
the
main
traits
of
the
figure
i
can
at
least
indicate
at
first
you
saw
only
a
mass
of
coarse
matted
black
hair
presently
it
was
seen
that
this
covered
a
body
of
fearful
thinness
almost
a
skeleton
but
with
the
muscles
standing
out
like
wires
the
hands
were
of
a
dusky
pallor
covered
like
the
body
with
long
coarse
hairs
and
hideously
taloned
the
eyes
touched
in
with
a
burning
yellow
had
intensely
black
pupils
and
were
fixed
upon
the
throned
king
with
a
look
of
beast-like
hate
imagine
one
of
the
awful
bird-catching
spiders
of
south
america
translated
into
human
form
and
endowed
with
intelligence
just
less
than
human
and
you
will
have
some
faint
conception
of
the
terror
inspired
by
the
appalling
effigy
one
remark
is
universally
made
by
those
to
whom
i
have
shown
the
picture
'it
was
drawn
from
the
life'
as
soon
as
the
first
shock
of
his
irresistible
fright
had
subsided
dennistoun
stole
a
look
at
his
hosts
the
sacristan's
hands
were
pressed
upon
his
eyes
his
daughter
looking
up
at
the
cross
on
the
wall
was
telling
her
beads
feverishly
at
last
the
question
was
asked
'is
this
book
for
sale'
there
was
the
same
hesitation
the
same
plunge
of
determination
that
he
had
noticed
before
and
then
came
the
welcome
answer
'if
monsieur
pleases'
'how
much
do
you
ask
for
it'
'i
will
take
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs'
this
was
confounding
even
a
collector's
conscience
is
sometimes
stirred
and
dennistoun's
conscience
was
tenderer
than
a
collector's
'my
good
man'
he
said
again
and
again
'your
book
is
worth
far
more
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
i
assure
you--far
more'
but
the
answer
did
not
vary
'i
will
take
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs--not
more'
there
was
really
no
possibility
of
refusing
such
a
chance
the
money
was
paid
the
receipt
signed
a
glass
of
wine
drunk
over
the
transaction
and
then
the
sacristan
seemed
to
become
a
new
man
he
stood
upright
he
ceased
to
throw
those
suspicious
glances
behind
him
he
actually
laughed
or
tried
to
laugh
dennistoun
rose
to
go
'i
shall
have
the
honour
of
accompanying
monsieur
to
his
hotel'
said
the
sacristan
'oh
no
thanks
it
isn't
a
hundred
yards
i
know
the
way
perfectly
and
there
is
a
moon'
the
offer
was
pressed
three
or
four
times
and
refused
as
often
'then
monsieur
will
summon
me
if--if
he
finds
occasion
he
will
keep
the
middle
of
the
road
the
sides
are
so
rough'
'certainly
certainly'
said
dennistoun
who
was
impatient
to
examine
his
prize
by
himself
and
he
stepped
out
into
the
passage
with
his
book
under
his
arm
here
he
was
met
by
the
daughter
she
it
appeared
was
anxious
to
do
a
little
business
on
her
own
account
perhaps
like
gehazi
to
'take
somewhat'
from
the
foreigner
whom
her
father
had
spared
'a
silver
crucifix
and
chain
for
the
neck
monsieur
would
perhaps
be
good
enough
to
accept
it'
well
really
dennistoun
hadn't
much
use
for
these
things
what
did
mademoiselle
want
for
it
'nothing--nothing
in
the
world
monsieur
is
more
than
welcome
to
it'
the
tone
in
which
this
and
much
more
was
said
was
unmistakably
genuine
so
that
dennistoun
was
reduced
to
profuse
thanks
and
submitted
to
have
the
chain
put
round
his
neck
it
really
seemed
as
if
he
had
rendered
the
father
and
daughter
some
service
which
they
hardly
knew
how
to
repay
as
he
set
off
with
his
book
they
stood
at
the
door
looking
after
him
and
they
were
still
looking
when
he
waved
them
a
last
good
night
from
the
steps
of
the
chapeau
rouge
dinner
was
over
and
dennistoun
was
in
his
bedroom
shut
up
alone
with
his
acquisition
the
landlady
had
manifested
a
particular
interest
in
him
since
he
had
told
her
that
he
had
paid
a
visit
to
the
sacristan
and
bought
an
old
book
from
him
he
thought
too
that
he
had
heard
a
hurried
dialogue
between
her
and
the
said
sacristan
in
the
passage
outside
the
salle
ã
manger
some
words
to
the
effect
that
'pierre
and
bertrand
would
be
sleeping
in
the
house'
had
closed
the
conversation
all
this
time
a
growing
feeling
of
discomfort
had
been
creeping
over
him--nervous
reaction
perhaps
after
the
delight
of
his
discovery
whatever
it
was
it
resulted
in
a
conviction
that
there
was
someone
behind
him
and
that
he
was
far
more
comfortable
with
his
back
to
the
wall
all
this
of
course
weighed
light
in
the
balance
as
against
the
obvious
value
of
the
collection
he
had
acquired
and
now
as
i
said
he
was
alone
in
his
bedroom
taking
stock
of
canon
alberic's
treasures
in
which
every
moment
revealed
something
more
charming
'bless
canon
alberic'
said
dennistoun
who
had
an
inveterate
habit
of
talking
to
himself
'i
wonder
where
he
is
now
dear
me
i
wish
that
landlady
would
learn
to
laugh
in
a
more
cheering
manner
it
makes
one
feel
as
if
there
was
someone
dead
in
the
house
half
a
pipe
more
did
you
say
i
think
perhaps
you
are
right
i
wonder
what
that
crucifix
is
that
the
young
woman
insisted
on
giving
me
last
century
i
suppose
yes
probably
it
is
rather
a
nuisance
of
a
thing
to
have
round
one's
neck--just
too
heavy
most
likely
her
father
has
been
wearing
it
for
years
i
think
i
might
give
it
a
clean
up
before
i
put
it
away'
he
had
taken
the
crucifix
off
and
laid
it
on
the
table
when
his
attention
was
caught
by
an
object
lying
on
the
red
cloth
just
by
his
left
elbow
two
or
three
ideas
of
what
it
might
be
flitted
through
his
brain
with
their
own
incalculable
quickness
a
penwiper
no
no
such
thing
in
the
house
a
rat
no
too
black
a
large
spider
i
trust
to
goodness
not--no
good
god
a
hand
like
the
hand
in
that
picture
in
another
infinitesimal
flash
he
had
taken
it
in
pale
dusky
skin
covering
nothing
but
bones
and
tendons
of
appalling
strength
coarse
black
hairs
longer
than
ever
grew
on
a
human
hand
nails
rising
from
the
ends
of
the
fingers
and
curving
sharply
down
and
forward
grey
horny
and
wrinkled
he
flew
out
of
his
chair
with
deadly
inconceivable
terror
clutching
at
his
heart
the
shape
whose
left
hand
rested
on
the
table
was
rising
to
a
standing
posture
behind
his
seat
its
right
hand
crooked
above
his
scalp
there
was
black
and
tattered
drapery
about
it
the
coarse
hair
covered
it
as
in
the
drawing
the
lower
jaw
was
thin--what
can
i
call
it--shallow
like
a
beast's
teeth
showed
behind
the
black
lips
there
was
no
nose
the
eyes
of
a
fiery
yellow
against
which
the
pupils
showed
black
and
intense
and
the
exulting
hate
and
thirst
to
destroy
life
which
shone
there
were
the
most
horrifying
features
in
the
whole
vision
there
was
intelligence
of
a
kind
in
them--intelligence
beyond
that
of
a
beast
below
that
of
a
man
the
feelings
which
this
horror
stirred
in
dennistoun
were
the
intensest
physical
fear
and
the
most
profound
mental
loathing
what
did
he
do
what
could
he
do
he
has
never
been
quite
certain
what
words
he
said
but
he
knows
that
he
spoke
that
he
grasped
blindly
at
the
silver
crucifix
that
he
was
conscious
of
a
movement
towards
him
on
the
part
of
the
demon
and
that
he
screamed
with
the
voice
of
an
animal
in
hideous
pain
pierre
and
bertrand
the
two
sturdy
little
serving-men
who
rushed
in
saw
nothing
but
felt
themselves
thrust
aside
by
something
that
passed
out
between
them
and
found
dennistoun
in
a
swoon
they
sat
up
with
him
that
night
and
his
two
friends
were
at
st
bertrand
by
nine
o'clock
next
morning
he
himself
though
still
shaken
and
nervous
was
almost
himself
by
that
time
and
his
story
found
credence
with
them
though
not
until
they
had
seen
the
drawing
and
talked
with
the
sacristan
almost
at
dawn
the
little
man
had
come
to
the
inn
on
some
pretence
and
had
listened
with
the
deepest
interest
to
the
story
retailed
by
the
landlady
he
showed
no
surprise
'it
is
he--it
is
he
i
have
seen
him
myself'
was
his
only
comment
and
to
all
questionings
but
one
reply
was
vouchsafed
'deux
fois
je
l'ai
vu
mille
fois
je
l'ai
senti'
he
would
tell
them
nothing
of
the
provenance
of
the
book
nor
any
details
of
his
experiences
'i
shall
soon
sleep
and
my
rest
will
be
sweet
why
should
you
trouble
me'
he
said2

he
died
that
summer
his
daughter
married
and
settled
at
st
papoul
she
never
understood
the
circumstances
of
her
father's
'obsession'

shall
never

'in

sudden
seizure'
details
of
this
kind
are
not
common
in
the
great
work
of
the
sammarthani
i
have
never
quite
understood
what
was
dennistoun's
view
of
the
events
i
have
narrated
he
quoted
to
me
once
a
text
from
ecclesiasticus
'some
spirits
there
be
that
are
created
for
vengeance
and
in
their
fury
lay
on
sore
strokes'
on
another
occasion
he
said
'isaiah
was
a
very
sensible
man
doesn't
he
say
something
about
night
monsters
living
in
the
ruins
of
babylon
these
things
are
rather
beyond
us
at
present'
another
confidence
of
his
impressed
me
rather
and
i
sympathized
with
it
we
had
been
last
year
to
comminges
to
see
canon
alberic's
tomb
it
is
a
great
marble
erection
with
an
effigy
of
the
canon
in
a
large
wig
and
soutane
and
an
elaborate
eulogy
of
his
learning
below
i
saw
dennistoun
talking
for
some
time
with
the
vicar
of
st
bertrand's
and
as
we
drove
away
he
said
to
me
'i
hope
it
isn't
wrong
you
know
i
am
a
presbyterian--but
i--i
believe
there
will
be
saying
of
mass
and
singing
of
dirges
for
alberic
de
maulã©on's
rest'
then
he
added
with
a
touch
of
the
northern
british
in
his
tone
'i
had
no
notion
they
came
so
dear'





the
book
is
in
the
wentworth
collection
at
cambridge
the
drawing
was
photographed
and
then
burnt
by
dennistoun
on
the
day
when
he
left
comminges
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
lost
hearts
it
was
as
far
as
i
can
ascertain
in
september
of
the
year
1811
that
a
post-chaise
drew
up
before
the
door
of
aswarby
hall
in
the
heart
of
lincolnshire
the
little
boy
who
was
the
only
passenger
in
the
chaise
and
who
jumped
out
as
soon
as
it
had
stopped
looked
about
him
with
the
keenest
curiosity
during
the
short
interval
that
elapsed
between
the
ringing
of
the
bell
and
the
opening
of
the
hall
door
he
saw
a
tall
square
red-brick
house
built
in
the
reign
of
anne
a
stone-pillared
porch
had
been
added
in
the
purer
classical
style
of
1790
the
windows
of
the
house
were
many
tall
and
narrow
with
small
panes
and
thick
white
woodwork
a
pediment
pierced
with
a
round
window
crowned
the
front
there
were
wings
to
right
and
left
connected
by
curious
glazed
galleries
supported
by
colonnades
with
the
central
block
these
wings
plainly
contained
the
stables
and
offices
of
the
house
each
was
surmounted
by
an
ornamental
cupola
with
a
gilded
vane
an
evening
light
shone
on
the
building
making
the
window-panes
glow
like
so
many
fires
away
from
the
hall
in
front
stretched
a
flat
park
studded
with
oaks
and
fringed
with
firs
which
stood
out
against
the
sky
the
clock
in
the
church-tower
buried
in
trees
on
the
edge
of
the
park
only
its
golden
weather-cock
catching
the
light
was
striking
six
and
the
sound
came
gently
beating
down
the
wind
it
was
altogether
a
pleasant
impression
though
tinged
with
the
sort
of
melancholy
appropriate
to
an
evening
in
early
autumn
that
was
conveyed
to
the
mind
of
the
boy
who
was
standing
in
the
porch
waiting
for
the
door
to
open
to
him
the
post-chaise
had
brought
him
from
warwickshire
where
some
six
months
before
he
had
been
left
an
orphan
now
owing
to
the
generous
offer
of
his
elderly
cousin
mr
abney
he
had
come
to
live
at
aswarby
the
offer
was
unexpected
because
all
who
knew
anything
of
mr
abney
looked
upon
him
as
a
somewhat
austere
recluse
into
whose
steady-going
household
the
advent
of
a
small
boy
would
import
a
new
and
it
seemed
incongruous
element
the
truth
is
that
very
little
was
known
of
mr
abney's
pursuits
or
temper
the
professor
of
greek
at
cambridge
had
been
heard
to
say
that
no
one
knew
more
of
the
religious
beliefs
of
the
later
pagans
than
did
the
owner
of
aswarby
certainly
his
library
contained
all
the
then
available
books
bearing
on
the
mysteries
the
orphic
poems
the
worship
of
mithras
and
the
neo-platonists
in
the
marble-paved
hall
stood
a
fine
group
of
mithras
slaying
a
bull
which
had
been
imported
from
the
levant
at
great
expense
by
the
owner
he
had
contributed
a
description
of
it
to
the
gentleman's
magazine
and
he
had
written
a
remarkable
series
of
articles
in
the
critical
museum
on
the
superstitions
of
the
romans
of
the
lower
empire
he
was
looked
upon
in
fine
as
a
man
wrapped
up
in
his
books
and
it
was
a
matter
of
great
surprise
among
his
neighbours
that
he
should
ever
have
heard
of
his
orphan
cousin
stephen
elliott
much
more
that
he
should
have
volunteered
to
make
him
an
inmate
of
aswarby
hall
whatever
may
have
been
expected
by
his
neighbours
it
is
certain
that
mr
abney--the
tall
the
thin
the
austere--seemed
inclined
to
give
his
young
cousin
a
kindly
reception
the
moment
the
front-door
was
opened
he
darted
out
of
his
study
rubbing
his
hands
with
delight
'how
are
you
my
boy--how
are
you
how
old
are
you'
said
he--'that
is
you
are
not
too
much
tired
i
hope
by
your
journey
to
eat
your
supper'
'no
thank
you
sir'
said
master
elliott
'i
am
pretty
well'
'that's
a
good
lad'
said
mr
abney
'and
how
old
are
you
my
boy'
it
seemed
a
little
odd
that
he
should
have
asked
the
question
twice
in
the
first
two
minutes
of
their
acquaintance
'i'm
twelve
years
old
next
birthday
sir'
said
stephen
'and
when
is
your
birthday
my
dear
boy
eleventh
of
september
eh
that's
well--that's
very
well
nearly
a
year
hence
isn't
it
i
like--ha
ha--i
like
to
get
these
things
down
in
my
book
sure
it's
twelve
certain'
'yes
quite
sure
sir'
'well
well
take
him
to
mrs
bunch's
room
parkes
and
let
him
have
his
tea--supper--whatever
it
is'
'yes
sir'
answered
the
staid
mr
parkes
and
conducted
stephen
to
the
lower
regions
mrs
bunch
was
the
most
comfortable
and
human
person
whom
stephen
had
as
yet
met
at
aswarby
she
made
him
completely
at
home
they
were
great
friends
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
great
friends
they
remained
mrs
bunch
had
been
born
in
the
neighbourhood
some
fifty-five
years
before
the
date
of
stephen's
arrival
and
her
residence
at
the
hall
was
of
twenty
years'
standing
consequently
if
anyone
knew
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
house
and
the
district
mrs
bunch
knew
them
and
she
was
by
no
means
disinclined
to
communicate
her
information
certainly
there
were
plenty
of
things
about
the
hall
and
the
hall
gardens
which
stephen
who
was
of
an
adventurous
and
inquiring
turn
was
anxious
to
have
explained
to
him
'who
built
the
temple
at
the
end
of
the
laurel
walk
who
was
the
old
man
whose
picture
hung
on
the
staircase
sitting
at
a
table
with
a
skull
under
his
hand'
these
and
many
similar
points
were
cleared
up
by
the
resources
of
mrs
bunch's
powerful
intellect
there
were
others
however
of
which
the
explanations
furnished
were
less
satisfactory
one
november
evening
stephen
was
sitting
by
the
fire
in
the
housekeeper's
room
reflecting
on
his
surroundings
'is
mr
abney
a
good
man
and
will
he
go
to
heaven'
he
suddenly
asked
with
the
peculiar
confidence
which
children
possess
in
the
ability
of
their
elders
to
settle
these
questions
the
decision
of
which
is
believed
to
be
reserved
for
other
tribunals
'good--bless
the
child'
said
mrs
bunch
'master's
as
kind
a
soul
as
ever
i
see
didn't
i
never
tell
you
of
the
little
boy
as
he
took
in
out
of
the
street
as
you
may
say
this
seven
years
back
and
the
little
girl
two
years
after
i
first
come
here'
'no
do
tell
me
all
about
them
mrs
bunch--now
this
minute'
'well'
said
mrs
bunch
'the
little
girl
i
don't
seem
to
recollect
so
much
about
i
know
master
brought
her
back
with
him
from
his
walk
one
day
and
give
orders
to
mrs
ellis
as
was
housekeeper
then
as
she
should
be
took
every
care
with
and
the
pore
child
hadn't
no
one
belonging
to
her--she
telled
me
so
her
own
self--and
here
she
lived
with
us
a
matter
of
three
weeks
it
might
be
and
then
whether
she
were
somethink
of
a
gipsy
in
her
blood
or
what
not
but
one
morning
she
out
of
her
bed
afore
any
of
us
had
opened
a
eye
and
neither
track
nor
yet
trace
of
her
have
i
set
eyes
on
since
master
was
wonderful
put
about
and
had
all
the
ponds
dragged
but
it's
my
belief
she
was
had
away
by
them
gipsies
for
there
was
singing
round
the
house
for
as
much
as
an
hour
the
night
she
went
and
parkes
he
declare
as
he
heard
them
a-calling
in
the
woods
all
that
afternoon
dear
dear
a
hodd
child
she
was
so
silent
in
her
ways
and
all
but
i
was
wonderful
taken
up
with
her
so
domesticated
she
was--surprising'
'and
what
about
the
little
boy'
said
stephen
'ah
that
pore
boy'
sighed
mrs
bunch
'he
were
a
foreigner--jevanny
he
called
hisself--and
he
come
a-tweaking
his
'urdy-gurdy
round
and
about
the
drive
one
winter
day
and
master
'ad
him
in
that
minute
and
ast
all
about
where
he
came
from
and
how
old
he
was
and
how
he
made
his
way
and
where
was
his
relatives
and
all
as
kind
as
heart
could
wish
but
it
went
the
same
way
with
him
they're
a
hunruly
lot
them
foreign
nations
i
do
suppose
and
he
was
off
one
fine
morning
just
the
same
as
the
girl
why
he
went
and
what
he
done
was
our
question
for
as
much
as
a
year
after
for
he
never
took
his
'urdy-gurdy
and
there
it
lays
on
the
shelf'
the
remainder
of
the
evening
was
spent
by
stephen
in
miscellaneous
cross-examination
of
mrs
bunch
and
in
efforts
to
extract
a
tune
from
the
hurdy-gurdy
that
night
he
had
a
curious
dream
at
the
end
of
the
passage
at
the
top
of
the
house
in
which
his
bedroom
was
situated
there
was
an
old
disused
bathroom
it
was
kept
locked
but
the
upper
half
of
the
door
was
glazed
and
since
the
muslin
curtains
which
used
to
hang
there
had
long
been
gone
you
could
look
in
and
see
the
lead-lined
bath
affixed
to
the
wall
on
the
right
hand
with
its
head
towards
the
window
on
the
night
of
which
i
am
speaking
stephen
elliott
found
himself
as
he
thought
looking
through
the
glazed
door
the
moon
was
shining
through
the
window
and
he
was
gazing
at
a
figure
which
lay
in
the
bath
his
description
of
what
he
saw
reminds
me
of
what
i
once
beheld
myself
in
the
famous
vaults
of
st
michan's
church
in
dublin
which
possesses
the
horrid
property
of
preserving
corpses
from
decay
for
centuries
a
figure
inexpressibly
thin
and
pathetic
of
a
dusty
leaden
colour
enveloped
in
a
shroud-like
garment
the
thin
lips
crooked
into
a
faint
and
dreadful
smile
the
hands
pressed
tightly
over
the
region
of
the
heart
as
he
looked
upon
it
a
distant
almost
inaudible
moan
seemed
to
issue
from
its
lips
and
the
arms
began
to
stir
the
terror
of
the
sight
forced
stephen
backwards
and
he
awoke
to
the
fact
that
he
was
indeed
standing
on
the
cold
boarded
floor
of
the
passage
in
the
full
light
of
the
moon
with
a
courage
which
i
do
not
think
can
be
common
among
boys
of
his
age
he
went
to
the
door
of
the
bathroom
to
ascertain
if
the
figure
of
his
dreams
were
really
there
it
was
not
and
he
went
back
to
bed
mrs
bunch
was
much
impressed
next
morning
by
his
story
and
went
so
far
as
to
replace
the
muslin
curtain
over
the
glazed
door
of
the
bathroom
mr
abney
moreover
to
whom
he
confided
his
experiences
at
breakfast
was
greatly
interested
and
made
notes
of
the
matter
in
what
he
called
'his
book'
the
spring
equinox
was
approaching
as
mr
abney
frequently
reminded
his
cousin
adding
that
this
had
been
always
considered
by
the
ancients
to
be
a
critical
time
for
the
young
that
stephen
would
do
well
to
take
care
of
himself
and
to
shut
his
bedroom
window
at
night
and
that
censorinus
had
some
valuable
remarks
on
the
subject
two
incidents
that
occurred
about
this
time
made
an
impression
upon
stephen's
mind
the
first
was
after
an
unusually
uneasy
and
oppressed
night
that
he
had
passed--though
he
could
not
recall
any
particular
dream
that
he
had
had
the
following
evening
mrs
bunch
was
occupying
herself
in
mending
his
nightgown
'gracious
me
master
stephen'
she
broke
forth
rather
irritably
'how
do
you
manage
to
tear
your
nightdress
all
to
flinders
this
way
look
here
sir
what
trouble
you
do
give
to
poor
servants
that
have
to
darn
and
mend
after
you'
there
was
indeed
a
most
destructive
and
apparently
wanton
series
of
slits
or
scorings
in
the
garment
which
would
undoubtedly
require
a
skilful
needle
to
make
good
they
were
confined
to
the
left
side
of
the
chest--long
parallel
slits
about
six
inches
in
length
some
of
them
not
quite
piercing
the
texture
of
the
linen
stephen
could
only
express
his
entire
ignorance
of
their
origin
he
was
sure
they
were
not
there
the
night
before
'but'
he
said
'mrs
bunch
they
are
just
the
same
as
the
scratches
on
the
outside
of
my
bedroom
door
and
i'm
sure
i
never
had
anything
to
do
with
making
them'
mrs
bunch
gazed
at
him
open-mouthed
then
snatched
up
a
candle
departed
hastily
from
the
room
and
was
heard
making
her
way
upstairs
in
a
few
minutes
she
came
down
'well'
she
said
'master
stephen
it's
a
funny
thing
to
me
how
them
marks
and
scratches
can
'a'
come
there--too
high
up
for
any
cat
or
dog
to
'ave
made
'em
much
less
a
rat
for
all
the
world
like
a
chinaman's
finger-nails
as
my
uncle
in
the
tea-trade
used
to
tell
us
of
when
we
was
girls
together
i
wouldn't
say
nothing
to
master
not
if
i
was
you
master
stephen
my
dear
and
just
turn
the
key
of
the
door
when
you
go
to
your
bed'
'i
always
do
mrs
bunch
as
soon
as
i've
said
my
prayers'
'ah
that's
a
good
child
always
say
your
prayers
and
then
no
one
can't
hurt
you'
herewith
mrs
bunch
addressed
herself
to
mending
the
injured
nightgown
with
intervals
of
meditation
until
bed-time
this
was
on
a
friday
night
in
march
1812
on
the
following
evening
the
usual
duet
of
stephen
and
mrs
bunch
was
augmented
by
the
sudden
arrival
of
mr
parkes
the
butler
who
as
a
rule
kept
himself
rather
to
himself
in
his
own
pantry
he
did
not
see
that
stephen
was
there
he
was
moreover
flustered
and
less
slow
of
speech
than
was
his
wont
'master
may
get
up
his
own
wine
if
he
likes
of
an
evening'
was
his
first
remark
'either
i
do
it
in
the
daytime
or
not
at
all
mrs
bunch
i
don't
know
what
it
may
be
very
like
it's
the
rats
or
the
wind
got
into
the
cellars
but
i'm
not
so
young
as
i
was
and
i
can't
go
through
with
it
as
i
have
done'
'well
mr
parkes
you
know
it
is
a
surprising
place
for
the
rats
is
the
hall'
'i'm
not
denying
that
mrs
bunch
and
to
be
sure
many
a
time
i've
heard
the
tale
from
the
men
in
the
shipyards
about
the
rat
that
could
speak
i
never
laid
no
confidence
in
that
before
but
tonight
if
i'd
demeaned
myself
to
lay
my
ear
to
the
door
of
the
further
bin
i
could
pretty
much
have
heard
what
they
was
saying'
'oh
there
mr
parkes
i've
no
patience
with
your
fancies
rats
talking
in
the
wine-cellar
indeed'
'well
mrs
bunch
i've
no
wish
to
argue
with
you
all
i
say
is
if
you
choose
to
go
to
the
far
bin
and
lay
your
ear
to
the
door
you
may
prove
my
words
this
minute'
'what
nonsense
you
do
talk
mr
parkes--not
fit
for
children
to
listen
to
why
you'll
be
frightening
master
stephen
there
out
of
his
wits'
'what
master
stephen'
said
parkes
awaking
to
the
consciousness
of
the
boy's
presence
'master
stephen
knows
well
enough
when
i'm
a-playing
a
joke
with
you
mrs
bunch'
in
fact
master
stephen
knew
much
too
well
to
suppose
that
mr
parkes
had
in
the
first
instance
intended
a
joke
he
was
interested
not
altogether
pleasantly
in
the
situation
but
all
his
questions
were
unsuccessful
in
inducing
the
butler
to
give
any
more
detailed
account
of
his
experiences
in
the
wine-cellar





we
have
now
arrived
at
march
24
1812
it
was
a
day
of
curious
experiences
for
stephen
a
windy
noisy
day
which
filled
the
house
and
the
gardens
with
a
restless
impression
as
stephen
stood
by
the
fence
of
the
grounds
and
looked
out
into
the
park
he
felt
as
if
an
endless
procession
of
unseen
people
were
sweeping
past
him
on
the
wind
borne
on
resistlessly
and
aimlessly
vainly
striving
to
stop
themselves
to
catch
at
something
that
might
arrest
their
flight
and
bring
them
once
again
into
contact
with
the
living
world
of
which
they
had
formed
a
part
after
luncheon
that
day
mr
abney
said
'stephen
my
boy
do
you
think
you
could
manage
to
come
to
me
tonight
as
late
as
eleven
o'clock
in
my
study
i
shall
be
busy
until
that
time
and
i
wish
to
show
you
something
connected
with
your
future
life
which
it
is
most
important
that
you
should
know
you
are
not
to
mention
this
matter
to
mrs
bunch
nor
to
anyone
else
in
the
house
and
you
had
better
go
to
your
room
at
the
usual
time'
here
was
a
new
excitement
added
to
life
stephen
eagerly
grasped
at
the
opportunity
of
sitting
up
till
eleven
o'clock
he
looked
in
at
the
library
door
on
his
way
upstairs
that
evening
and
saw
a
brazier
which
he
had
often
noticed
in
the
corner
of
the
room
moved
out
before
the
fire
an
old
silver-gilt
cup
stood
on
the
table
filled
with
red
wine
and
some
written
sheets
of
paper
lay
near
it
mr
abney
was
sprinkling
some
incense
on
the
brazier
from
a
round
silver
box
as
stephen
passed
but
did
not
seem
to
notice
his
step
the
wind
had
fallen
and
there
was
a
still
night
and
a
full
moon
at
about
ten
o'clock
stephen
was
standing
at
the
open
window
of
his
bedroom
looking
out
over
the
country
still
as
the
night
was
the
mysterious
population
of
the
distant
moon-lit
woods
was
not
yet
lulled
to
rest
from
time
to
time
strange
cries
as
of
lost
and
despairing
wanderers
sounded
from
across
the
mere
they
might
be
the
notes
of
owls
or
water-birds
yet
they
did
not
quite
resemble
either
sound
were
not
they
coming
nearer
now
they
sounded
from
the
nearer
side
of
the
water
and
in
a
few
moments
they
seemed
to
be
floating
about
among
the
shrubberies
then
they
ceased
but
just
as
stephen
was
thinking
of
shutting
the
window
and
resuming
his
reading
of
robinson
crusoe
he
caught
sight
of
two
figures
standing
on
the
gravelled
terrace
that
ran
along
the
garden
side
of
the
hall--the
figures
of
a
boy
and
girl
as
it
seemed
they
stood
side
by
side
looking
up
at
the
windows
something
in
the
form
of
the
girl
recalled
irresistibly
his
dream
of
the
figure
in
the
bath
the
boy
inspired
him
with
more
acute
fear
whilst
the
girl
stood
still
half
smiling
with
her
hands
clasped
over
her
heart
the
boy
a
thin
shape
with
black
hair
and
ragged
clothing
raised
his
arms
in
the
air
with
an
appearance
of
menace
and
of
unappeasable
hunger
and
longing
the
moon
shone
upon
his
almost
transparent
hands
and
stephen
saw
that
the
nails
were
fearfully
long
and
that
the
light
shone
through
them
as
he
stood
with
his
arms
thus
raised
he
disclosed
a
terrifying
spectacle
on
the
left
side
of
his
chest
there
opened
a
black
and
gaping
rent
and
there
fell
upon
stephen's
brain
rather
than
upon
his
ear
the
impression
of
one
of
those
hungry
and
desolate
cries
that
he
had
heard
resounding
over
the
woods
of
aswarby
all
that
evening
in
another
moment
this
dreadful
pair
had
moved
swiftly
and
noiselessly
over
the
dry
gravel
and
he
saw
them
no
more
inexpressibly
frightened
as
he
was
he
determined
to
take
his
candle
and
go
down
to
mr
abney's
study
for
the
hour
appointed
for
their
meeting
was
near
at
hand
the
study
or
library
opened
out
of
the
front-hall
on
one
side
and
stephen
urged
on
by
his
terrors
did
not
take
long
in
getting
there
to
effect
an
entrance
was
not
so
easy
it
was
not
locked
he
felt
sure
for
the
key
was
on
the
outside
of
the
door
as
usual
his
repeated
knocks
produced
no
answer
mr
abney
was
engaged
he
was
speaking
what
why
did
he
try
to
cry
out
and
why
was
the
cry
choked
in
his
throat
had
he
too
seen
the
mysterious
children
but
now
everything
was
quiet
and
the
door
yielded
to
stephen's
terrified
and
frantic
pushing





on
the
table
in
mr
abney's
study
certain
papers
were
found
which
explained
the
situation
to
stephen
elliott
when
he
was
of
an
age
to
understand
them
the
most
important
sentences
were
as
follows
'it
was
a
belief
very
strongly
and
generally
held
by
the
ancients--of
whose
wisdom
in
these
matters
i
have
had
such
experience
as
induces
me
to
place
confidence
in
their
assertions--that
by
enacting
certain
processes
which
to
us
moderns
have
something
of
a
barbaric
complexion
a
very
remarkable
enlightenment
of
the
spiritual
faculties
in
man
may
be
attained
that
for
example
by
absorbing
the
personalities
of
a
certain
number
of
his
fellow-creatures
an
individual
may
gain
a
complete
ascendancy
over
those
orders
of
spiritual
beings
which
control
the
elemental
forces
of
our
universe
'it
is
recorded
of
simon
magus
that
he
was
able
to
fly
in
the
air
to
become
invisible
or
to
assume
any
form
he
pleased
by
the
agency
of
the
soul
of
a
boy
whom
to
use
the
libellous
phrase
employed
by
the
author
of
the
clementine
recognitions
he
had
murdered
i
find
it
set
down
moreover
with
considerable
detail
in
the
writings
of
hermes
trismegistus
that
similar
happy
results
may
be
produced
by
the
absorption
of
the
hearts
of
not
less
than
three
human
beings
below
the
age
of
twenty-one
years
to
the
testing
of
the
truth
of
this
receipt
i
have
devoted
the
greater
part
of
the
last
twenty
years
selecting
as
the
corpora
vilia
of
my
experiment
such
persons
as
could
conveniently
be
removed
without
occasioning
a
sensible
gap
in
society
the
first
step
i
effected
by
the
removal
of
one
phoebe
stanley
a
girl
of
gipsy
extraction
on
march
24
1792
the
second
by
the
removal
of
a
wandering
italian
lad
named
giovanni
paoli
on
the
night
of
march
23
1805
the
final
victim--to
employ
a
word
repugnant
in
the
highest
degree
to
my
feelings--must
be
my
cousin
stephen
elliott
his
day
must
be
this
march
24
1812
'the
best
means
of
effecting
the
required
absorption
is
to
remove
the
heart
from
the
living
subject
to
reduce
it
to
ashes
and
to
mingle
them
with
about
a
pint
of
some
red
wine
preferably
port
the
remains
of
the
first
two
subjects
at
least
it
will
be
well
to
conceal
a
disused
bathroom
or
wine-cellar
will
be
found
convenient
for
such
a
purpose
some
annoyance
may
be
experienced
from
the
psychic
portion
of
the
subjects
which
popular
language
dignifies
with
the
name
of
ghosts
but
the
man
of
philosophic
temperament--to
whom
alone
the
experiment
is
appropriate--will
be
little
prone
to
attach
importance
to
the
feeble
efforts
of
these
beings
to
wreak
their
vengeance
on
him
i
contemplate
with
the
liveliest
satisfaction
the
enlarged
and
emancipated
existence
which
the
experiment
if
successful
will
confer
on
me
not
only
placing
me
beyond
the
reach
of
human
justice
so-called
but
eliminating
to
a
great
extent
the
prospect
of
death
itself'





mr
abney
was
found
in
his
chair
his
head
thrown
back
his
face
stamped
with
an
expression
of
rage
fright
and
mortal
pain
in
his
left
side
was
a
terrible
lacerated
wound
exposing
the
heart
there
was
no
blood
on
his
hands
and
a
long
knife
that
lay
on
the
table
was
perfectly
clean
a
savage
wild-cat
might
have
inflicted
the
injuries
the
window
of
the
study
was
open
and
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
coroner
that
mr
abney
had
met
his
death
by
the
agency
of
some
wild
creature
but
stephen
elliott's
study
of
the
papers
i
have
quoted
led
him
to
a
very
different
conclusion
the
mezzotint
some
time
ago
i
believe
i
had
the
pleasure
of
telling
you
the
story
of
an
adventure
which
happened
to
a
friend
of
mine
by
the
name
of
dennistoun
during
his
pursuit
of
objects
of
art
for
the
museum
at
cambridge
he
did
not
publish
his
experiences
very
widely
upon
his
return
to
england
but
they
could
not
fail
to
become
known
to
a
good
many
of
his
friends
and
among
others
to
the
gentleman
who
at
that
time
presided
over
an
art
museum
at
another
university
it
was
to
be
expected
that
the
story
should
make
a
considerable
impression
on
the
mind
of
a
man
whose
vocation
lay
in
lines
similar
to
dennistoun's
and
that
he
should
be
eager
to
catch
at
any
explanation
of
the
matter
which
tended
to
make
it
seem
improbable
that
he
should
ever
be
called
upon
to
deal
with
so
agitating
an
emergency
it
was
indeed
somewhat
consoling
to
him
to
reflect
that
he
was
not
expected
to
acquire
ancient
mss
for
his
institution
that
was
the
business
of
the
shelburnian
library
the
authorities
of
that
institution
might
if
they
pleased
ransack
obscure
corners
of
the
continent
for
such
matters
he
was
glad
to
be
obliged
at
the
moment
to
confine
his
attention
to
enlarging
the
already
unsurpassed
collection
of
english
topographical
drawings
and
engravings
possessed
by
his
museum
yet
as
it
turned
out
even
a
department
so
homely
and
familiar
as
this
may
have
its
dark
corners
and
to
one
of
these
mr
williams
was
unexpectedly
introduced
those
who
have
taken
even
the
most
limited
interest
in
the
acquisition
of
topographical
pictures
are
aware
that
there
is
one
london
dealer
whose
aid
is
indispensable
to
their
researches
mr
j
w
britnell
publishes
at
short
intervals
very
admirable
catalogues
of
a
large
and
constantly
changing
stock
of
engravings
plans
and
old
sketches
of
mansions
churches
and
towns
in
england
and
wales
these
catalogues
were
of
course
the
abc
of
his
subject
to
mr
williams
but
as
his
museum
already
contained
an
enormous
accumulation
of
topographical
pictures
he
was
a
regular
rather
than
a
copious
buyer
and
he
rather
looked
to
mr
britnell
to
fill
up
gaps
in
the
rank
and
file
of
his
collection
than
to
supply
him
with
rarities
now
in
february
of
last
year
there
appeared
upon
mr
williams's
desk
at
the
museum
a
catalogue
from
mr
britnell's
emporium
and
accompanying
it
was
a
typewritten
communication
from
the
dealer
himself
this
latter
ran
as
follows
dear
sir
we
beg
to
call
your
attention
to
no
978
in
our
accompanying
catalogue
which
we
shall
be
glad
to
send
on
approval
yours
faithfully
j
w
britnell
to
turn
to
no
978
in
the
accompanying
catalogue
was
with
mr
williams
as
he
observed
to
himself
the
work
of
a
moment
and
in
the
place
indicated
he
found
the
following
entry
978--unknown
interesting
mezzotint
view
of
a
manor-house
early
part
of
the
century
15
by
10
inches
black
frame
â£2
2s
it
was
not
specially
exciting
and
the
price
seemed
high
however
as
mr
britnell
who
knew
his
business
and
his
customer
seemed
to
set
store
by
it
mr
williams
wrote
a
postcard
asking
for
the
article
to
be
sent
on
approval
along
with
some
other
engravings
and
sketches
which
appeared
in
the
same
catalogue
and
so
he
passed
without
much
excitement
of
anticipation
to
the
ordinary
labours
of
the
day
a
parcel
of
any
kind
always
arrives
a
day
later
than
you
expect
it
and
that
of
mr
britnell
proved
as
i
believe
the
right
phrase
goes
no
exception
to
the
rule
it
was
delivered
at
the
museum
by
the
afternoon
post
of
saturday
after
mr
williams
had
left
his
work
and
it
was
accordingly
brought
round
to
his
rooms
in
college
by
the
attendant
in
order
that
he
might
not
have
to
wait
over
sunday
before
looking
through
it
and
returning
such
of
the
contents
as
he
did
not
propose
to
keep
and
here
he
found
it
when
he
came
in
to
tea
with
a
friend
the
only
item
with
which
i
am
concerned
was
the
rather
large
black-framed
mezzotint
of
which
i
have
already
quoted
the
short
description
given
in
mr
britnell's
catalogue
some
more
details
of
it
will
have
to
be
given
though
i
cannot
hope
to
put
before
you
the
look
of
the
picture
as
clearly
as
it
is
present
to
my
own
eye
very
nearly
the
exact
duplicate
of
it
may
be
seen
in
a
good
many
old
inn
parlours
or
in
the
passages
of
undisturbed
country
mansions
at
the
present
moment
it
was
a
rather
indifferent
mezzotint
and
an
indifferent
mezzotint
is
perhaps
the
worst
form
of
engraving
known
it
presented
a
full-face
view
of
a
not
very
large
manor-house
of
the
last
century
with
three
rows
of
plain
sashed
windows
with
rusticated
masonry
about
them
a
parapet
with
balls
or
vases
at
the
angles
and
a
small
portico
in
the
centre
on
either
side
were
trees
and
in
front
a
considerable
expanse
of
lawn
the
legend
a
w
f
sculpsit
was
engraved
on
the
narrow
margin
and
there
was
no
further
inscription
the
whole
thing
gave
the
impression
that
it
was
the
work
of
an
amateur
what
in
the
world
mr
britnell
could
mean
by
affixing
the
price
of
â£2
2s
to
such
an
object
was
more
than
mr
williams
could
imagine
he
turned
it
over
with
a
good
deal
of
contempt
upon
the
back
was
a
paper
label
the
left-hand
half
of
which
had
been
torn
off
all
that
remained
were
the
ends
of
two
lines
of
writing
the
first
had
the
letters--ngley
hall
the
second--ssex
it
would
perhaps
be
just
worth
while
to
identify
the
place
represented
which
he
could
easily
do
with
the
help
of
a
gazetteer
and
then
he
would
send
it
back
to
mr
britnell
with
some
remarks
reflecting
upon
the
judgement
of
that
gentleman
he
lighted
the
candles
for
it
was
now
dark
made
the
tea
and
supplied
the
friend
with
whom
he
had
been
playing
golf
for
i
believe
the
authorities
of
the
university
i
write
of
indulge
in
that
pursuit
by
way
of
relaxation
and
tea
was
taken
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
discussion
which
golfing
persons
can
imagine
for
themselves
but
which
the
conscientious
writer
has
no
right
to
inflict
upon
any
non-golfing
persons
the
conclusion
arrived
at
was
that
certain
strokes
might
have
been
better
and
that
in
certain
emergencies
neither
player
had
experienced
that
amount
of
luck
which
a
human
being
has
a
right
to
expect
it
was
now
that
the
friend--let
us
call
him
professor
binks--took
up
the
framed
engraving
and
said
'what's
this
place
williams'
'just
what
i
am
going
to
try
to
find
out'
said
williams
going
to
the
shelf
for
a
gazetteer
'look
at
the
back
somethingley
hall
either
in
sussex
or
essex
half
the
name's
gone
you
see
you
don't
happen
to
know
it
i
suppose'
'it's
from
that
man
britnell
i
suppose
isn't
it'
said
binks
'is
it
for
the
museum'
'well
i
think
i
should
buy
it
if
the
price
was
five
shillings'
said
williams
'but
for
some
unearthly
reason
he
wants
two
guineas
for
it
i
can't
conceive
why
it's
a
wretched
engraving
and
there
aren't
even
any
figures
to
give
it
life'
'it's
not
worth
two
guineas
i
should
think'
said
binks
'but
i
don't
think
it's
so
badly
done
the
moonlight
seems
rather
good
to
me
and
i
should
have
thought
there
were
figures
or
at
least
a
figure
just
on
the
edge
in
front'
'let's
look'
said
williams
'well
it's
true
the
light
is
rather
cleverly
given
where's
your
figure
oh
yes
just
the
head
in
the
very
front
of
the
picture'
and
indeed
there
was--hardly
more
than
a
black
blot
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
engraving--the
head
of
a
man
or
woman
a
good
deal
muffled
up
the
back
turned
to
the
spectator
and
looking
towards
the
house
williams
had
not
noticed
it
before
'still'
he
said
'though
it's
a
cleverer
thing
than
i
thought
i
can't
spend
two
guineas
of
museum
money
on
a
picture
of
a
place
i
don't
know'
professor
binks
had
his
work
to
do
and
soon
went
and
very
nearly
up
to
hall
time
williams
was
engaged
in
a
vain
attempt
to
identify
the
subject
of
his
picture
'if
the
vowel
before
the
ng
had
only
been
left
it
would
have
been
easy
enough'
he
thought
'but
as
it
is
the
name
may
be
anything
from
guestingley
to
langley
and
there
are
many
more
names
ending
like
this
than
i
thought
and
this
rotten
book
has
no
index
of
terminations'
hall
in
mr
williams's
college
was
at
seven
it
need
not
be
dwelt
upon
the
less
so
as
he
met
there
colleagues
who
had
been
playing
golf
during
the
afternoon
and
words
with
which
we
have
no
concern
were
freely
bandied
across
the
table--merely
golfing
words
i
would
hasten
to
explain
i
suppose
an
hour
or
more
to
have
been
spent
in
what
is
called
common-room
after
dinner
later
in
the
evening
some
few
retired
to
williams's
rooms
and
i
have
little
doubt
that
whist
was
played
and
tobacco
smoked
during
a
lull
in
these
operations
williams
picked
up
the
mezzotint
from
the
table
without
looking
at
it
and
handed
it
to
a
person
mildly
interested
in
art
telling
him
where
it
had
come
from
and
the
other
particulars
which
we
already
know
the
gentleman
took
it
carelessly
looked
at
it
then
said
in
a
tone
of
some
interest
'it's
really
a
very
good
piece
of
work
williams
it
has
quite
a
feeling
of
the
romantic
period
the
light
is
admirably
managed
it
seems
to
me
and
the
figure
though
it's
rather
too
grotesque
is
somehow
very
impressive'
'yes
isn't
it'
said
williams
who
was
just
then
busy
giving
whisky
and
soda
to
others
of
the
company
and
was
unable
to
come
across
the
room
to
look
at
the
view
again
it
was
by
this
time
rather
late
in
the
evening
and
the
visitors
were
on
the
move
after
they
went
williams
was
obliged
to
write
a
letter
or
two
and
clear
up
some
odd
bits
of
work
at
last
some
time
past
midnight
he
was
disposed
to
turn
in
and
he
put
out
his
lamp
after
lighting
his
bedroom
candle
the
picture
lay
face
upwards
on
the
table
where
the
last
man
who
looked
at
it
had
put
it
and
it
caught
his
eye
as
he
turned
the
lamp
down
what
he
saw
made
him
very
nearly
drop
the
candle
on
the
floor
and
he
declares
now
if
he
had
been
left
in
the
dark
at
that
moment
he
would
have
had
a
fit
but
as
that
did
not
happen
he
was
able
to
put
down
the
light
on
the
table
and
take
a
good
look
at
the
picture
it
was
indubitable--rankly
impossible
no
doubt
but
absolutely
certain
in
the
middle
of
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
unknown
house
there
was
a
figure
where
no
figure
had
been
at
five
o'clock
that
afternoon
it
was
crawling
on
all
fours
towards
the
house
and
it
was
muffled
in
a
strange
black
garment
with
a
white
cross
on
the
back
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
ideal
course
to
pursue
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
i
can
only
tell
you
what
mr
williams
did
he
took
the
picture
by
one
corner
and
carried
it
across
the
passage
to
a
second
set
of
rooms
which
he
possessed
there
he
locked
it
up
in
a
drawer
sported
the
doors
of
both
sets
of
rooms
and
retired
to
bed
but
first
he
wrote
out
and
signed
an
account
of
the
extraordinary
change
which
the
picture
had
undergone
since
it
had
come
into
his
possession
sleep
visited
him
rather
late
but
it
was
consoling
to
reflect
that
the
behaviour
of
the
picture
did
not
depend
upon
his
own
unsupported
testimony
evidently
the
man
who
had
looked
at
it
the
night
before
had
seen
something
of
the
same
kind
as
he
had
otherwise
he
might
have
been
tempted
to
think
that
something
gravely
wrong
was
happening
either
to
his
eyes
or
his
mind
this
possibility
being
fortunately
precluded
two
matters
awaited
him
on
the
morrow
he
must
take
stock
of
the
picture
very
carefully
and
call
in
a
witness
for
the
purpose
and
he
must
make
a
determined
effort
to
ascertain
what
house
it
was
that
was
represented
he
would
therefore
ask
his
neighbour
nisbet
to
breakfast
with
him
and
he
would
subsequently
spend
a
morning
over
the
gazetteer
nisbet
was
disengaged
and
arrived
about
920
his
host
was
not
quite
dressed
i
am
sorry
to
say
even
at
this
late
hour
during
breakfast
nothing
was
said
about
the
mezzotint
by
williams
save
that
he
had
a
picture
on
which
he
wished
for
nisbet's
opinion
but
those
who
are
familiar
with
university
life
can
picture
for
themselves
the
wide
and
delightful
range
of
subjects
over
which
the
conversation
of
two
fellows
of
canterbury
college
is
likely
to
extend
during
a
sunday
morning
breakfast
hardly
a
topic
was
left
unchallenged
from
golf
to
lawn-tennis
yet
i
am
bound
to
say
that
williams
was
rather
distraught
for
his
interest
naturally
centred
in
that
very
strange
picture
which
was
now
reposing
face
downwards
in
the
drawer
in
the
room
opposite
the
morning
pipe
was
at
last
lighted
and
the
moment
had
arrived
for
which
he
looked
with
very
considerable--almost
tremulous--excitement
he
ran
across
unlocked
the
drawer
and
extracting
the
picture--still
face
downwards--ran
back
and
put
it
into
nisbet's
hands
'now'
he
said
'nisbet
i
want
you
to
tell
me
exactly
what
you
see
in
that
picture
describe
it
if
you
don't
mind
rather
minutely
i'll
tell
you
why
afterwards'
'well'
said
nisbet
'i
have
here
a
view
of
a
country-house--english
i
presume--by
moonlight'
'moonlight
you're
sure
of
that'
'certainly
the
moon
appears
to
be
on
the
wane
if
you
wish
for
details
and
there
are
clouds
in
the
sky'
'all
right
go
on
i'll
swear'
added
williams
in
an
aside
'there
was
no
moon
when
i
saw
it
first'
'well
there's
not
much
more
to
be
said'
nisbet
continued
'the
house
has
one--two--three
rows
of
windows
five
in
each
row
except
at
the
bottom
where
there's
a
porch
instead
of
the
middle
one
and--'
'but
what
about
figures'
said
williams
with
marked
interest
'there
aren't
any'
said
nisbet
'but--'
'what
no
figure
on
the
grass
in
front'
'not
a
thing'
'you'll
swear
to
that'
'certainly
i
will
but
there's
just
one
other
thing'
'what'
'why
one
of
the
windows
on
the
ground-floor--left
of
the
door--is
open'
'is
it
really
so
my
goodness
he
must
have
got
in'
said
williams
with
great
excitement
and
he
hurried
to
the
back
of
the
sofa
on
which
nisbet
was
sitting
and
catching
the
picture
from
him
verified
the
matter
for
himself
it
was
quite
true
there
was
no
figure
and
there
was
the
open
window
williams
after
a
moment
of
speechless
surprise
went
to
the
writing-table
and
scribbled
for
a
short
time
then
he
brought
two
papers
to
nisbet
and
asked
him
first
to
sign
one--it
was
his
own
description
of
the
picture
which
you
have
just
heard--and
then
to
read
the
other
which
was
williams's
statement
written
the
night
before
'what
can
it
all
mean'
said
nisbet
'exactly'
said
williams
'well
one
thing
i
must
do--or
three
things
now
i
think
of
it
i
must
find
out
from
garwood'--this
was
his
last
night's
visitor--'what
he
saw
and
then
i
must
get
the
thing
photographed
before
it
goes
further
and
then
i
must
find
out
what
the
place
is'
'i
can
do
the
photographing
myself'
said
nisbet
'and
i
will
but
you
know
it
looks
very
much
as
if
we
were
assisting
at
the
working
out
of
a
tragedy
somewhere
the
question
is
has
it
happened
already
or
is
it
going
to
come
off
you
must
find
out
what
the
place
is
yes'
he
said
looking
at
the
picture
again
'i
expect
you're
right
he
has
got
in
and
if
i
don't
mistake
there'll
be
the
devil
to
pay
in
one
of
the
rooms
upstairs'
'i'll
tell
you
what'
said
williams
'i'll
take
the
picture
across
to
old
green'
this
was
the
senior
fellow
of
the
college
who
had
been
bursar
for
many
years
'it's
quite
likely
he'll
know
it
we
have
property
in
essex
and
sussex
and
he
must
have
been
over
the
two
counties
a
lot
in
his
time'
'quite
likely
he
will'
said
nisbet
'but
just
let
me
take
my
photograph
first
but
look
here
i
rather
think
green
isn't
up
today
he
wasn't
in
hall
last
night
and
i
think
i
heard
him
say
he
was
going
down
for
the
sunday'
'that's
true
too'
said
williams
'i
know
he's
gone
to
brighton
well
if
you'll
photograph
it
now
i'll
go
across
to
garwood
and
get
his
statement
and
you
keep
an
eye
on
it
while
i'm
gone
i'm
beginning
to
think
two
guineas
is
not
a
very
exorbitant
price
for
it
now'
in
a
short
time
he
had
returned
and
brought
mr
garwood
with
him
garwood's
statement
was
to
the
effect
that
the
figure
when
he
had
seen
it
was
clear
of
the
edge
of
the
picture
but
had
not
got
far
across
the
lawn
he
remembered
a
white
mark
on
the
back
of
its
drapery
but
could
not
have
been
sure
it
was
a
cross
a
document
to
this
effect
was
then
drawn
up
and
signed
and
nisbet
proceeded
to
photograph
the
picture
'now
what
do
you
mean
to
do'
he
said
'are
you
going
to
sit
and
watch
it
all
day'
'well
no
i
think
not'
said
williams
'i
rather
imagine
we're
meant
to
see
the
whole
thing
you
see
between
the
time
i
saw
it
last
night
and
this
morning
there
was
time
for
lots
of
things
to
happen
but
the
creature
only
got
into
the
house
it
could
easily
have
got
through
its
business
in
the
time
and
gone
to
its
own
place
again
but
the
fact
of
the
window
being
open
i
think
must
mean
that
it's
in
there
now
so
i
feel
quite
easy
about
leaving
it
and
besides
i
have
a
kind
of
idea
that
it
wouldn't
change
much
if
at
all
in
the
daytime
we
might
go
out
for
a
walk
this
afternoon
and
come
in
to
tea
or
whenever
it
gets
dark
i
shall
leave
it
out
on
the
table
here
and
sport
the
door
my
skip
can
get
in
but
no
one
else'
the
three
agreed
that
this
would
be
a
good
plan
and
further
that
if
they
spent
the
afternoon
together
they
would
be
less
likely
to
talk
about
the
business
to
other
people
for
any
rumour
of
such
a
transaction
as
was
going
on
would
bring
the
whole
of
the
phasmatological
society
about
their
ears
we
may
give
them
a
respite
until
five
o'clock
at
or
near
that
hour
the
three
were
entering
williams's
staircase
they
were
at
first
slightly
annoyed
to
see
that
the
door
of
his
rooms
was
unsported
but
in
a
moment
it
was
remembered
that
on
sunday
the
skips
came
for
orders
an
hour
or
so
earlier
than
on
weekdays
however
a
surprise
was
awaiting
them
the
first
thing
they
saw
was
the
picture
leaning
up
against
a
pile
of
books
on
the
table
as
it
had
been
left
and
the
next
thing
was
williams's
skip
seated
on
a
chair
opposite
gazing
at
it
with
undisguised
horror
how
was
this
mr
filcher
the
name
is
not
my
own
invention
was
a
servant
of
considerable
standing
and
set
the
standard
of
etiquette
to
all
his
own
college
and
to
several
neighbouring
ones
and
nothing
could
be
more
alien
to
his
practice
than
to
be
found
sitting
on
his
master's
chair
or
appearing
to
take
any
particular
notice
of
his
master's
furniture
or
pictures
indeed
he
seemed
to
feel
this
himself
he
started
violently
when
the
three
men
were
in
the
room
and
got
up
with
a
marked
effort
then
he
said
'i
ask
your
pardon
sir
for
taking
such
a
freedom
as
to
set
down'
'not
at
all
robert'
interposed
mr
williams
'i
was
meaning
to
ask
you
some
time
what
you
thought
of
that
picture'
'well
sir
of
course
i
don't
set
up
my
opinion
against
yours
but
it
ain't
the
pictur
i
should
'ang
where
my
little
girl
could
see
it
sir'
'wouldn't
you
robert
why
not'
'no
sir
why
the
pore
child
i
recollect
once
she
see
a
door
bible
with
pictures
not
'alf
what
that
is
and
we
'ad
to
set
up
with
her
three
or
four
nights
afterwards
if
you'll
believe
me
and
if
she
was
to
ketch
a
sight
of
this
skelinton
here
or
whatever
it
is
carrying
off
the
pore
baby
she
would
be
in
a
taking
you
know
'ow
it
is
with
children
'ow
nervish
they
git
with
a
little
thing
and
all
but
what
i
should
say
it
don't
seem
a
right
pictur
to
be
laying
about
sir
not
where
anyone
that's
liable
to
be
startled
could
come
on
it
should
you
be
wanting
anything
this
evening
sir
thank
you
sir'
with
these
words
the
excellent
man
went
to
continue
the
round
of
his
masters
and
you
may
be
sure
the
gentlemen
whom
he
left
lost
no
time
in
gathering
round
the
engraving
there
was
the
house
as
before
under
the
waning
moon
and
the
drifting
clouds
the
window
that
had
been
open
was
shut
and
the
figure
was
once
more
on
the
lawn
but
not
this
time
crawling
cautiously
on
hands
and
knees
now
it
was
erect
and
stepping
swiftly
with
long
strides
towards
the
front
of
the
picture
the
moon
was
behind
it
and
the
black
drapery
hung
down
over
its
face
so
that
only
hints
of
that
could
be
seen
and
what
was
visible
made
the
spectators
profoundly
thankful
that
they
could
see
no
more
than
a
white
dome-like
forehead
and
a
few
straggling
hairs
the
head
was
bent
down
and
the
arms
were
tightly
clasped
over
an
object
which
could
be
dimly
seen
and
identified
as
a
child
whether
dead
or
living
it
was
not
possible
to
say
the
legs
of
the
appearance
alone
could
be
plainly
discerned
and
they
were
horribly
thin
from
five
to
seven
the
three
companions
sat
and
watched
the
picture
by
turns
but
it
never
changed
they
agreed
at
last
that
it
would
be
safe
to
leave
it
and
that
they
would
return
after
hall
and
await
further
developments
when
they
assembled
again
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
the
engraving
was
there
but
the
figure
was
gone
and
the
house
was
quiet
under
the
moonbeams
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
spend
the
evening
over
gazetteers
and
guide-books
williams
was
the
lucky
one
at
last
and
perhaps
he
deserved
it
at
1130
pm
he
read
from
murray's
guide
to
essex
the
following
lines
16-12
miles
anningley
the
church
has
been
an
interesting
building
of
norman
date
but
was
extensively
classicized
in
the
last
century
it
contains
the
tomb
of
the
family
of
francis
whose
mansion
anningley
hall
a
solid
queen
anne
house
stands
immediately
beyond
the
churchyard
in
a
park
of
about
80
acres
the
family
is
now
extinct
the
last
heir
having
disappeared
mysteriously
in
infancy
in
the
year
1802
the
father
mr
arthur
francis
was
locally
known
as
a
talented
amateur
engraver
in
mezzotint
after
his
son's
disappearance
he
lived
in
complete
retirement
at
the
hall
and
was
found
dead
in
his
studio
on
the
third
anniversary
of
the
disaster
having
just
completed
an
engraving
of
the
house
impressions
of
which
are
of
considerable
rarity
this
looked
like
business
and
indeed
mr
green
on
his
return
at
once
identified
the
house
as
anningley
hall
'is
there
any
kind
of
explanation
of
the
figure
green'
was
the
question
which
williams
naturally
asked
'i
don't
know
i'm
sure
williams
what
used
to
be
said
in
the
place
when
i
first
knew
it
which
was
before
i
came
up
here
was
just
this
old
francis
was
always
very
much
down
on
these
poaching
fellows
and
whenever
he
got
a
chance
he
used
to
get
a
man
whom
he
suspected
of
it
turned
off
the
estate
and
by
degrees
he
got
rid
of
them
all
but
one
squires
could
do
a
lot
of
things
then
that
they
daren't
think
of
now
well
this
man
that
was
left
was
what
you
find
pretty
often
in
that
country--the
last
remains
of
a
very
old
family
i
believe
they
were
lords
of
the
manor
at
one
time
i
recollect
just
the
same
thing
in
my
own
parish'
'what
like
the
man
in
tess
o'
the
durbervilles'
williams
put
in
'yes
i
dare
say
it's
not
a
book
i
could
ever
read
myself
but
this
fellow
could
show
a
row
of
tombs
in
the
church
there
that
belonged
to
his
ancestors
and
all
that
went
to
sour
him
a
bit
but
francis
they
said
could
never
get
at
him--he
always
kept
just
on
the
right
side
of
the
law--until
one
night
the
keepers
found
him
at
it
in
a
wood
right
at
the
end
of
the
estate
i
could
show
you
the
place
now
it
marches
with
some
land
that
used
to
belong
to
an
uncle
of
mine
and
you
can
imagine
there
was
a
row
and
this
man
gawdy
that
was
the
name
to
be
sure--gawdy
i
thought
i
should
get
it--gawdy
he
was
unlucky
enough
poor
chap
to
shoot
a
keeper
well
that
was
what
francis
wanted
and
grand
juries--you
know
what
they
would
have
been
then--and
poor
gawdy
was
strung
up
in
double-quick
time
and
i've
been
shown
the
place
he
was
buried
in
on
the
north
side
of
the
church--you
know
the
way
in
that
part
of
the
world
anyone
that's
been
hanged
or
made
away
with
themselves
they
bury
them
that
side
and
the
idea
was
that
some
friend
of
gawdy's--not
a
relation
because
he
had
none
poor
devil
he
was
the
last
of
his
line
kind
of
spes
ultima
gentis--must
have
planned
to
get
hold
of
francis's
boy
and
put
an
end
to
his
line
too
i
don't
know--it's
rather
an
out-of-the-way
thing
for
an
essex
poacher
to
think
of--but
you
know
i
should
say
now
it
looks
more
as
if
old
gawdy
had
managed
the
job
himself
booh
i
hate
to
think
of
it
have
some
whisky
williams'
the
facts
were
communicated
by
williams
to
dennistoun
and
by
him
to
a
mixed
company
of
which
i
was
one
and
the
sadducean
professor
of
ophiology
another
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
the
latter
when
asked
what
he
thought
of
it
only
remarked
'oh
those
bridgeford
people
will
say
anything'--a
sentiment
which
met
with
the
reception
it
deserved
i
have
only
to
add
that
the
picture
is
now
in
the
ashleian
museum
that
it
has
been
treated
with
a
view
to
discovering
whether
sympathetic
ink
has
been
used
in
it
but
without
effect
that
mr
britnell
knew
nothing
of
it
save
that
he
was
sure
it
was
uncommon
and
that
though
carefully
watched
it
has
never
been
known
to
change
again
the
ash-tree
everyone
who
has
travelled
over
eastern
england
knows
the
smaller
country-houses
with
which
it
is
studded--the
rather
dank
little
buildings
usually
in
the
italian
style
surrounded
with
parks
of
some
eighty
to
a
hundred
acres
for
me
they
have
always
had
a
very
strong
attraction
with
the
grey
paling
of
split
oak
the
noble
trees
the
meres
with
their
reed-beds
and
the
line
of
distant
woods
then
i
like
the
pillared
portico--perhaps
stuck
on
to
a
red-brick
queen
anne
house
which
has
been
faced
with
stucco
to
bring
it
into
line
with
the
'grecian'
taste
of
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
hall
inside
going
up
to
the
roof
which
hall
ought
always
to
be
provided
with
a
gallery
and
a
small
organ
i
like
the
library
too
where
you
may
find
anything
from
a
psalter
of
the
thirteenth
century
to
a
shakespeare
quarto
i
like
the
pictures
of
course
and
perhaps
most
of
all
i
like
fancying
what
life
in
such
a
house
was
when
it
was
first
built
and
in
the
piping
times
of
landlords'
prosperity
and
not
least
now
when
if
money
is
not
so
plentiful
taste
is
more
varied
and
life
quite
as
interesting
i
wish
to
have
one
of
these
houses
and
enough
money
to
keep
it
together
and
entertain
my
friends
in
it
modestly
but
this
is
a
digression
i
have
to
tell
you
of
a
curious
series
of
events
which
happened
in
such
a
house
as
i
have
tried
to
describe
it
is
castringham
hall
in
suffolk
i
think
a
good
deal
has
been
done
to
the
building
since
the
period
of
my
story
but
the
essential
features
i
have
sketched
are
still
there--italian
portico
square
block
of
white
house
older
inside
than
out
park
with
fringe
of
woods
and
mere
the
one
feature
that
marked
out
the
house
from
a
score
of
others
is
gone
as
you
looked
at
it
from
the
park
you
saw
on
the
right
a
great
old
ash-tree
growing
within
half
a
dozen
yards
of
the
wall
and
almost
or
quite
touching
the
building
with
its
branches
i
suppose
it
had
stood
there
ever
since
castringham
ceased
to
be
a
fortified
place
and
since
the
moat
was
filled
in
and
the
elizabethan
dwelling-house
built
at
any
rate
it
had
well-nigh
attained
its
full
dimensions
in
the
year
1690
in
that
year
the
district
in
which
the
hall
is
situated
was
the
scene
of
a
number
of
witch-trials
it
will
be
long
i
think
before
we
arrive
at
a
just
estimate
of
the
amount
of
solid
reason--if
there
was
any--which
lay
at
the
root
of
the
universal
fear
of
witches
in
old
times
whether
the
persons
accused
of
this
offence
really
did
imagine
that
they
were
possessed
of
unusual
power
of
any
kind
or
whether
they
had
the
will
at
least
if
not
the
power
of
doing
mischief
to
their
neighbours
or
whether
all
the
confessions
of
which
there
are
so
many
were
extorted
by
the
cruelty
of
the
witch-finders--these
are
questions
which
are
not
i
fancy
yet
solved
and
the
present
narrative
gives
me
pause
i
cannot
altogether
sweep
it
away
as
mere
invention
the
reader
must
judge
for
himself
castringham
contributed
a
victim
to
the
auto-da-fã©
mrs
mothersole
was
her
name
and
she
differed
from
the
ordinary
run
of
village
witches
only
in
being
rather
better
off
and
in
a
more
influential
position
efforts
were
made
to
save
her
by
several
reputable
farmers
of
the
parish
they
did
their
best
to
testify
to
her
character
and
showed
considerable
anxiety
as
to
the
verdict
of
the
jury
but
what
seems
to
have
been
fatal
to
the
woman
was
the
evidence
of
the
then
proprietor
of
castringham
hall--sir
matthew
fell
he
deposed
to
having
watched
her
on
three
different
occasions
from
his
window
at
the
full
of
the
moon
gathering
sprigs
'from
the
ash-tree
near
my
house'
she
had
climbed
into
the
branches
clad
only
in
her
shift
and
was
cutting
off
small
twigs
with
a
peculiarly
curved
knife
and
as
she
did
so
she
seemed
to
be
talking
to
herself
on
each
occasion
sir
matthew
had
done
his
best
to
capture
the
woman
but
she
had
always
taken
alarm
at
some
accidental
noise
he
had
made
and
all
he
could
see
when
he
got
down
to
the
garden
was
a
hare
running
across
the
path
in
the
direction
of
the
village
on
the
third
night
he
had
been
at
the
pains
to
follow
at
his
best
speed
and
had
gone
straight
to
mrs
mothersole's
house
but
he
had
had
to
wait
a
quarter
of
an
hour
battering
at
her
door
and
then
she
had
come
out
very
cross
and
apparently
very
sleepy
as
if
just
out
of
bed
and
he
had
no
good
explanation
to
offer
of
his
visit
mainly
on
this
evidence
though
there
was
much
more
of
a
less
striking
and
unusual
kind
from
other
parishioners
mrs
mothersole
was
found
guilty
and
condemned
to
die
she
was
hanged
a
week
after
the
trial
with
five
or
six
more
unhappy
creatures
at
bury
st
edmunds
sir
matthew
fell
then
deputy-sheriff
was
present
at
the
execution
it
was
a
damp
drizzly
march
morning
when
the
cart
made
its
way
up
the
rough
grass
hill
outside
northgate
where
the
gallows
stood
the
other
victims
were
apathetic
or
broken
down
with
misery
but
mrs
mothersole
was
as
in
life
so
in
death
of
a
very
different
temper
her
'poysonous
rage'
as
a
reporter
of
the
time
puts
it
'did
so
work
upon
the
bystanders--yea
even
upon
the
hangman--that
it
was
constantly
affirmed
of
all
that
saw
her
that
she
presented
the
living
aspect
of
a
mad
divell
yet
she
offer'd
no
resistance
to
the
officers
of
the
law
onely
she
looked
upon
those
that
laid
hands
upon
her
with
so
direfull
and
venomous
an
aspect
that--as
one
of
them
afterwards
assured
me--the
meer
thought
of
it
preyed
inwardly
upon
his
mind
for
six
months
after'
however
all
that
she
is
reported
to
have
said
were
the
seemingly
meaningless
words
'there
will
be
guests
at
the
hall'
which
she
repeated
more
than
once
in
an
undertone
sir
matthew
fell
was
not
unimpressed
by
the
bearing
of
the
woman
he
had
some
talk
upon
the
matter
with
the
vicar
of
his
parish
with
whom
he
travelled
home
after
the
assize
business
was
over
his
evidence
at
the
trial
had
not
been
very
willingly
given
he
was
not
specially
infected
with
the
witch-finding
mania
but
he
declared
then
and
afterwards
that
he
could
not
give
any
other
account
of
the
matter
than
that
he
had
given
and
that
he
could
not
possibly
have
been
mistaken
as
to
what
he
saw
the
whole
transaction
had
been
repugnant
to
him
for
he
was
a
man
who
liked
to
be
on
pleasant
terms
with
those
about
him
but
he
saw
a
duty
to
be
done
in
this
business
and
he
had
done
it
that
seems
to
have
been
the
gist
of
his
sentiments
and
the
vicar
applauded
it
as
any
reasonable
man
must
have
done
a
few
weeks
after
when
the
moon
of
may
was
at
the
full
vicar
and
squire
met
again
in
the
park
and
walked
to
the
hall
together
lady
fell
was
with
her
mother
who
was
dangerously
ill
and
sir
matthew
was
alone
at
home
so
the
vicar
mr
crome
was
easily
persuaded
to
take
a
late
supper
at
the
hall
sir
matthew
was
not
very
good
company
this
evening
the
talk
ran
chiefly
on
family
and
parish
matters
and
as
luck
would
have
it
sir
matthew
made
a
memorandum
in
writing
of
certain
wishes
or
intentions
of
his
regarding
his
estates
which
afterwards
proved
exceedingly
useful
when
mr
crome
thought
of
starting
for
home
about
half
past
nine
o'clock
sir
matthew
and
he
took
a
preliminary
turn
on
the
gravelled
walk
at
the
back
of
the
house
the
only
incident
that
struck
mr
crome
was
this
they
were
in
sight
of
the
ash-tree
which
i
described
as
growing
near
the
windows
of
the
building
when
sir
matthew
stopped
and
said
'what
is
that
that
runs
up
and
down
the
stem
of
the
ash
it
is
never
a
squirrel
they
will
all
be
in
their
nests
by
now'
the
vicar
looked
and
saw
the
moving
creature
but
he
could
make
nothing
of
its
colour
in
the
moonlight
the
sharp
outline
however
seen
for
an
instant
was
imprinted
on
his
brain
and
he
could
have
sworn
he
said
though
it
sounded
foolish
that
squirrel
or
not
it
had
more
than
four
legs
still
not
much
was
to
be
made
of
the
momentary
vision
and
the
two
men
parted
they
may
have
met
since
then
but
it
was
not
for
a
score
of
years
next
day
sir
matthew
fell
was
not
downstairs
at
six
in
the
morning
as
was
his
custom
nor
at
seven
nor
yet
at
eight
hereupon
the
servants
went
and
knocked
at
his
chamber
door
i
need
not
prolong
the
description
of
their
anxious
listenings
and
renewed
batterings
on
the
panels
the
door
was
opened
at
last
from
the
outside
and
they
found
their
master
dead
and
black
so
much
you
have
guessed
that
there
were
any
marks
of
violence
did
not
at
the
moment
appear
but
the
window
was
open
one
of
the
men
went
to
fetch
the
parson
and
then
by
his
directions
rode
on
to
give
notice
to
the
coroner
mr
crome
himself
went
as
quick
as
he
might
to
the
hall
and
was
shown
to
the
room
where
the
dead
man
lay
he
has
left
some
notes
among
his
papers
which
show
how
genuine
a
respect
and
sorrow
was
felt
for
sir
matthew
and
there
is
also
this
passage
which
i
transcribe
for
the
sake
of
the
light
it
throws
upon
the
course
of
events
and
also
upon
the
common
beliefs
of
the
time
'there
was
not
any
the
least
trace
of
an
entrance
having
been
forc'd
to
the
chamber
but
the
casement
stood
open
as
my
poor
friend
would
always
have
it
in
this
season
he
had
his
evening
drink
of
small
ale
in
a
silver
vessel
of
about
a
pint
measure
and
tonight
had
not
drunk
it
out
this
drink
was
examined
by
the
physician
from
bury
a
mr
hodgkins
who
could
not
however
as
he
afterwards
declar'd
upon
his
oath
before
the
coroner's
quest
discover
that
any
matter
of
a
venomous
kind
was
present
in
it
for
as
was
natural
in
the
great
swelling
and
blackness
of
the
corpse
there
was
talk
made
among
the
neighbours
of
poyson
the
body
was
very
much
disorder'd
as
it
laid
in
the
bed
being
twisted
after
so
extream
a
sort
as
gave
too
probable
conjecture
that
my
worthy
friend
and
patron
had
expir'd
in
great
pain
and
agony
and
what
is
as
yet
unexplain'd
and
to
myself
the
argument
of
some
horrid
and
artfull
designe
in
the
perpetrators
of
this
barbarous
murther
was
this
that
the
women
which
were
entrusted
with
the
laying-out
of
the
corpse
and
washing
it
being
both
sad
pearsons
and
very
well
respected
in
their
mournfull
profession
came
to
me
in
a
great
pain
and
distress
both
of
mind
and
body
saying
what
was
indeed
confirmed
upon
the
first
view
that
they
had
no
sooner
touch'd
the
breast
of
the
corpse
with
their
naked
hands
than
they
were
sensible
of
a
more
than
ordinary
violent
smart
and
acheing
in
their
palms
which
with
their
whole
forearms
in
no
long
time
swell'd
so
immoderately
the
pain
still
continuing
that
as
afterwards
proved
during
many
weeks
they
were
forc'd
to
lay
by
the
exercise
of
their
calling
and
yet
no
mark
seen
on
the
skin
'upon
hearing
this
i
sent
for
the
physician
who
was
still
in
the
house
and
we
made
as
carefull
a
proof
as
we
were
able
by
the
help
of
a
small
magnifying
lens
of
crystal
of
the
condition
of
the
skinn
on
this
part
of
the
body
but
could
not
detect
with
the
instrument
we
had
any
matter
of
importance
beyond
a
couple
of
small
punctures
or
pricks
which
we
then
concluded
were
the
spotts
by
which
the
poyson
might
be
introduced
remembering
that
ring
of
pope
borgia
with
other
known
specimens
of
the
horrid
art
of
the
italian
poysoners
of
the
last
age
'so
much
is
to
be
said
of
the
symptoms
seen
on
the
corpse
as
to
what
i
am
to
add
it
is
meerly
my
own
experiment
and
to
be
left
to
posterity
to
judge
whether
there
be
anything
of
value
therein
there
was
on
the
table
by
the
beddside
a
bible
of
the
small
size
in
which
my
friend--punctuall
as
in
matters
of
less
moment
so
in
this
more
weighty
one--used
nightly
and
upon
his
first
rising
to
read
a
sett
portion
and
i
taking
it
up--not
without
a
tear
duly
paid
to
him
wich
from
the
study
of
this
poorer
adumbration
was
now
pass'd
to
the
contemplation
of
its
great
originall--it
came
into
my
thoughts
as
at
such
moments
of
helplessness
we
are
prone
to
catch
at
any
the
least
glimmer
that
makes
promise
of
light
to
make
trial
of
that
old
and
by
many
accounted
superstitious
practice
of
drawing
the
sortes
of
which
a
principall
instance
in
the
case
of
his
late
sacred
majesty
the
blessed
martyr
king
charles
and
my
lord
falkland
was
now
much
talked
of
i
must
needs
admit
that
by
my
trial
not
much
assistance
was
afforded
me
yet
as
the
cause
and
origin
of
these
dreadfull
events
may
hereafter
be
search'd
out
i
set
down
the
results
in
the
case
it
may
be
found
that
they
pointed
the
true
quarter
of
the
mischief
to
a
quicker
intelligence
than
my
own
'i
made
then
three
trials
opening
the
book
and
placing
my
finger
upon
certain
words
which
gave

first

words

her

this
is
all
that
need
be
quoted
from
mr
crome's
papers
sir
matthew
fell
was
duly
coffined
and
laid
into
the
earth
and
his
funeral
sermon
preached
by
mr
crome
on
the
following
sunday
has
been
printed
under
the
title
of
'the
unsearchable
way
or
england's
danger
and
the
malicious
dealings
of
antichrist'
it
being
the
vicar's
view
as
well
as
that
most
commonly
held
in
the
neighbourhood
that
the
squire
was
the
victim
of
a
recrudescence
of
the
popish
plot
his
son
sir
matthew
the
second
succeeded
to
the
title
and
estates
and
so
ends
the
first
act
of
the
castringham
tragedy
it
is
to
be
mentioned
though
the
fact
is
not
surprising
that
the
new
baronet
did
not
occupy
the
room
in
which
his
father
had
died
nor
indeed
was
it
slept
in
by
anyone
but
an
occasional
visitor
during
the
whole
of
his
occupation
he
died
in
1735
and
i
do
not
find
that
anything
particular
marked
his
reign
save
a
curiously
constant
mortality
among
his
cattle
and
live-stock
in
general
which
showed
a
tendency
to
increase
slightly
as
time
went
on
those
who
are
interested
in
the
details
will
find
a
statistical
account
in
a
letter
to
the
gentleman's
magazine
of
1772
which
draws
the
facts
from
the
baronet's
own
papers
he
put
an
end
to
it
at
last
by
a
very
simple
expedient
that
of
shutting
up
all
his
beasts
in
sheds
at
night
and
keeping
no
sheep
in
his
park
for
he
had
noticed
that
nothing
was
ever
attacked
that
spent
the
night
indoors
after
that
the
disorder
confined
itself
to
wild
birds
and
beasts
of
chase
but
as
we
have
no
good
account
of
the
symptoms
and
as
all-night
watching
was
quite
unproductive
of
any
clue
i
do
not
dwell
on
what
the
suffolk
farmers
called
the
'castringham
sickness'
the
second
sir
matthew
died
in
1735
as
i
said
and
was
duly
succeeded
by
his
son
sir
richard
it
was
in
his
time
that
the
great
family
pew
was
built
out
on
the
north
side
of
the
parish
church
so
large
were
the
squire's
ideas
that
several
of
the
graves
on
that
unhallowed
side
of
the
building
had
to
be
disturbed
to
satisfy
his
requirements
among
them
was
that
of
mrs
mothersole
the
position
of
which
was
accurately
known
thanks
to
a
note
on
a
plan
of
the
church
and
yard
both
made
by
mr
crome
a
certain
amount
of
interest
was
excited
in
the
village
when
it
was
known
that
the
famous
witch
who
was
still
remembered
by
a
few
was
to
be
exhumed
and
the
feeling
of
surprise
and
indeed
disquiet
was
very
strong
when
it
was
found
that
though
her
coffin
was
fairly
sound
and
unbroken
there
was
no
trace
whatever
inside
it
of
body
bones
or
dust
indeed
it
is
a
curious
phenomenon
for
at
the
time
of
her
burying
no
such
things
were
dreamt
of
as
resurrection-men
and
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
any
rational
motive
for
stealing
a
body
otherwise
than
for
the
uses
of
the
dissecting-room
the
incident
revived
for
a
time
all
the
stories
of
witch-trials
and
of
the
exploits
of
the
witches
dormant
for
forty
years
and
sir
richard's
orders
that
the
coffin
should
be
burnt
were
thought
by
a
good
many
to
be
rather
foolhardy
though
they
were
duly
carried
out
sir
richard
was
a
pestilent
innovator
it
is
certain
before
his
time
the
hall
had
been
a
fine
block
of
the
mellowest
red
brick
but
sir
richard
had
travelled
in
italy
and
become
infected
with
the
italian
taste
and
having
more
money
than
his
predecessors
he
determined
to
leave
an
italian
palace
where
he
had
found
an
english
house
so
stucco
and
ashlar
masked
the
brick
some
indifferent
roman
marbles
were
planted
about
in
the
entrance-hall
and
gardens
a
reproduction
of
the
sibyl's
temple
at
tivoli
was
erected
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
mere
and
castringham
took
on
an
entirely
new
and
i
must
say
a
less
engaging
aspect
but
it
was
much
admired
and
served
as
a
model
to
a
good
many
of
the
neighbouring
gentry
in
after-years





one
morning
it
was
in
1754
sir
richard
woke
after
a
night
of
discomfort
it
had
been
windy
and
his
chimney
had
smoked
persistently
and
yet
it
was
so
cold
that
he
must
keep
up
a
fire
also
something
had
so
rattled
about
the
window
that
no
man
could
get
a
moment's
peace
further
there
was
the
prospect
of
several
guests
of
position
arriving
in
the
course
of
the
day
who
would
expect
sport
of
some
kind
and
the
inroads
of
the
distemper
which
continued
among
his
game
had
been
lately
so
serious
that
he
was
afraid
for
his
reputation
as
a
game-preserver
but
what
really
touched
him
most
nearly
was
the
other
matter
of
his
sleepless
night
he
could
certainly
not
sleep
in
that
room
again
that
was
the
chief
subject
of
his
meditations
at
breakfast
and
after
it
he
began
a
systematic
examination
of
the
rooms
to
see
which
would
suit
his
notions
best
it
was
long
before
he
found
one
this
had
a
window
with
an
eastern
aspect
and
that
with
a
northern
this
door
the
servants
would
be
always
passing
and
he
did
not
like
the
bedstead
in
that
no
he
must
have
a
room
with
a
western
look-out
so
that
the
sun
could
not
wake
him
early
and
it
must
be
out
of
the
way
of
the
business
of
the
house
the
housekeeper
was
at
the
end
of
her
resources
'well
sir
richard'
she
said
'you
know
that
there
is
but
the
one
room
like
that
in
the
house'
'which
may
that
be'
said
sir
richard
'and
that
is
sir
matthew's--the
west
chamber'
'well
put
me
in
there
for
there
i'll
lie
tonight'
said
her
master
'which
way
is
it
here
to
be
sure'
and
he
hurried
off
'oh
sir
richard
but
no
one
has
slept
there
these
forty
years
the
air
has
hardly
been
changed
since
sir
matthew
died
there'
thus
she
spoke
and
rustled
after
him
'come
open
the
door
mrs
chiddock
i'll
see
the
chamber
at
least'
so
it
was
opened
and
indeed
the
smell
was
very
close
and
earthy
sir
richard
crossed
to
the
window
and
impatiently
as
was
his
wont
threw
the
shutters
back
and
flung
open
the
casement
for
this
end
of
the
house
was
one
which
the
alterations
had
barely
touched
grown
up
as
it
was
with
the
great
ash-tree
and
being
otherwise
concealed
from
view
'air
it
mrs
chiddock
all
today
and
move
my
bed-furniture
in
in
the
afternoon
put
the
bishop
of
kilmore
in
my
old
room'
'pray
sir
richard'
said
a
new
voice
breaking
in
on
this
speech
'might
i
have
the
favour
of
a
moment's
interview'
sir
richard
turned
round
and
saw
a
man
in
black
in
the
doorway
who
bowed
'i
must
ask
your
indulgence
for
this
intrusion
sir
richard
you
will
perhaps
hardly
remember
me
my
name
is
william
crome
and
my
grandfather
was
vicar
in
your
grandfather's
time'
'well
sir'
said
sir
richard
'the
name
of
crome
is
always
a
passport
to
castringham
i
am
glad
to
renew
a
friendship
of
two
generations'
standing
in
what
can
i
serve
you
for
your
hour
of
calling--and
if
i
do
not
mistake
you
your
bearing--shows
you
to
be
in
some
haste'
'that
is
no
more
than
the
truth
sir
i
am
riding
from
norwich
to
bury
st
edmunds
with
what
haste
i
can
make
and
i
have
called
in
on
my
way
to
leave
with
you
some
papers
which
we
have
but
just
come
upon
in
looking
over
what
my
grandfather
left
at
his
death
it
is
thought
you
may
find
some
matters
of
family
interest
in
them'
'you
are
mighty
obliging
mr
crome
and
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
follow
me
to
the
parlour
and
drink
a
glass
of
wine
we
will
take
a
first
look
at
these
same
papers
together
and
you
mrs
chiddock
as
i
said
be
about
airing
this
chamber
yes
it
is
here
my
grandfather
died
yes
the
tree
perhaps
does
make
the
place
a
little
dampish
no
i
do
not
wish
to
listen
to
any
more
make
no
difficulties
i
beg
you
have
your
orders--go
will
you
follow
me
sir'
they
went
to
the
study
the
packet
which
young
mr
crome
had
brought--he
was
then
just
become
a
fellow
of
clare
hall
in
cambridge
i
may
say
and
subsequently
brought
out
a
respectable
edition
of
polyaenus--contained
among
other
things
the
notes
which
the
old
vicar
had
made
upon
the
occasion
of
sir
matthew
fell's
death
and
for
the
first
time
sir
richard
was
confronted
with
the
enigmatical
sortes
biblicae
which
you
have
heard
they
amused
him
a
good
deal
'well'
he
said
'my
grandfather's
bible
gave
one
prudent
piece
of
advice--cut
it
down
if
that
stands
for
the
ash-tree
he
may
rest
assured
i
shall
not
neglect
it
such
a
nest
of
catarrhs
and
agues
was
never
seen'
the
parlour
contained
the
family
books
which
pending
the
arrival
of
a
collection
which
sir
richard
had
made
in
italy
and
the
building
of
a
proper
room
to
receive
them
were
not
many
in
number
sir
richard
looked
up
from
the
paper
to
the
bookcase
'i
wonder'
says
he
'whether
the
old
prophet
is
there
yet
i
fancy
i
see
him'
crossing
the
room
he
took
out
a
dumpy
bible
which
sure
enough
bore
on
the
flyleaf
the
inscription
'to
matthew
fell
from
his
loving
godmother
anne
aldous
2
september
1659'
'it
would
be
no
bad
plan
to
test
him
again
mr
crome
i
will
wager
we
get
a
couple
of
names
in
the
chronicles
h'm
what
have
we
here
thou
shalt
seek
me
in
the
morning
and
i
shall
not
be
well
well
your
grandfather
would
have
made
a
fine
omen
of
that
hey
no
more
prophets
for
me
they
are
all
in
a
tale
and
now
mr
crome
i
am
infinitely
obliged
to
you
for
your
packet
you
will
i
fear
be
impatient
to
get
on
pray
allow
me--another
glass'
so
with
offers
of
hospitality
which
were
genuinely
meant
for
sir
richard
thought
well
of
the
young
man's
address
and
manner
they
parted
in
the
afternoon
came
the
guests--the
bishop
of
kilmore
lady
mary
hervey
sir
william
kentfield
etc
dinner
at
five
wine
cards
supper
and
dispersal
to
bed
next
morning
sir
richard
is
disinclined
to
take
his
gun
with
the
rest
he
talks
with
the
bishop
of
kilmore
this
prelate
unlike
a
good
many
of
the
irish
bishops
of
his
day
had
visited
his
see
and
indeed
resided
there
for
some
considerable
time
this
morning
as
the
two
were
walking
along
the
terrace
and
talking
over
the
alterations
and
improvements
in
the
house
the
bishop
said
pointing
to
the
window
of
the
west
room
'you
could
never
get
one
of
my
irish
flock
to
occupy
that
room
sir
richard'
'why
is
that
my
lord
it
is
in
fact
my
own'
'well
our
irish
peasantry
will
always
have
it
that
it
brings
the
worst
of
luck
to
sleep
near
an
ash-tree
and
you
have
a
fine
growth
of
ash
not
two
yards
from
your
chamber
window
perhaps'
the
bishop
went
on
with
a
smile
'it
has
given
you
a
touch
of
its
quality
already
for
you
do
not
seem
if
i
may
say
it
so
much
the
fresher
for
your
night's
rest
as
your
friends
would
like
to
see
you'
'that
or
something
else
it
is
true
cost
me
my
sleep
from
twelve
to
four
my
lord
but
the
tree
is
to
come
down
tomorrow
so
i
shall
not
hear
much
more
from
it'
'i
applaud
your
determination
it
can
hardly
be
wholesome
to
have
the
air
you
breathe
strained
as
it
were
through
all
that
leafage'
'your
lordship
is
right
there
i
think
but
i
had
not
my
window
open
last
night
it
was
rather
the
noise
that
went
on--no
doubt
from
the
twigs
sweeping
the
glass--that
kept
me
open-eyed'
'i
think
that
can
hardly
be
sir
richard
here--you
see
it
from
this
point
none
of
these
nearest
branches
even
can
touch
your
casement
unless
there
were
a
gale
and
there
was
none
of
that
last
night
they
miss
the
panes
by
a
foot'
'no
sir
true
what
then
will
it
be
i
wonder
that
scratched
and
rustled
so--ay
and
covered
the
dust
on
my
sill
with
lines
and
marks'
at
last
they
agreed
that
the
rats
must
have
come
up
through
the
ivy
that
was
the
bishop's
idea
and
sir
richard
jumped
at
it
so
the
day
passed
quietly
and
night
came
and
the
party
dispersed
to
their
rooms
and
wished
sir
richard
a
better
night
and
now
we
are
in
his
bedroom
with
the
light
out
and
the
squire
in
bed
the
room
is
over
the
kitchen
and
the
night
outside
still
and
warm
so
the
window
stands
open
there
is
very
little
light
about
the
bedstead
but
there
is
a
strange
movement
there
it
seems
as
if
sir
richard
were
moving
his
head
rapidly
to
and
fro
with
only
the
slightest
possible
sound
and
now
you
would
guess
so
deceptive
is
the
half-darkness
that
he
had
several
heads
round
and
brownish
which
move
back
and
forward
even
as
low
as
his
chest
it
is
a
horrible
illusion
is
it
nothing
more
there
something
drops
off
the
bed
with
a
soft
plump
like
a
kitten
and
is
out
of
the
window
in
a
flash
another--four--and
after
that
there
is
quiet
again
thou
shall
seek
me
in
the
morning
and
i
shall
not
be
as
with
sir
matthew
so
with
sir
richard--dead
and
black
in
his
bed
a
pale
and
silent
party
of
guests
and
servants
gathered
under
the
window
when
the
news
was
known
italian
poisoners
popish
emissaries
infected
air--all
these
and
more
guesses
were
hazarded
and
the
bishop
of
kilmore
looked
at
the
tree
in
the
fork
of
whose
lower
boughs
a
white
tom-cat
was
crouching
looking
down
the
hollow
which
years
had
gnawed
in
the
trunk
it
was
watching
something
inside
the
tree
with
great
interest
suddenly
it
got
up
and
craned
over
the
hole
then
a
bit
of
the
edge
on
which
it
stood
gave
way
and
it
went
slithering
in
everyone
looked
up
at
the
noise
of
the
fall
it
is
known
to
most
of
us
that
a
cat
can
cry
but
few
of
us
have
heard
i
hope
such
a
yell
as
came
out
of
the
trunk
of
the
great
ash
two
or
three
screams
there
were--the
witnesses
are
not
sure
which--and
then
a
slight
and
muffled
noise
of
some
commotion
or
struggling
was
all
that
came
but
lady
mary
hervey
fainted
outright
and
the
housekeeper
stopped
her
ears
and
fled
till
she
fell
on
the
terrace
the
bishop
of
kilmore
and
sir
william
kentfield
stayed
yet
even
they
were
daunted
though
it
was
only
at
the
cry
of
a
cat
and
sir
william
swallowed
once
or
twice
before
he
could
say
'there
is
something
more
than
we
know
of
in
that
tree
my
lord
i
am
for
an
instant
search'
and
this
was
agreed
upon
a
ladder
was
brought
and
one
of
the
gardeners
went
up
and
looking
down
the
hollow
could
detect
nothing
but
a
few
dim
indications
of
something
moving
they
got
a
lantern
and
let
it
down
by
a
rope
'we
must
get
at
the
bottom
of
this
my
life
upon
it
my
lord
but
the
secret
of
these
terrible
deaths
is
there'
up
went
the
gardener
again
with
the
lantern
and
let
it
down
the
hole
cautiously
they
saw
the
yellow
light
upon
his
face
as
he
bent
over
and
saw
his
face
struck
with
an
incredulous
terror
and
loathing
before
he
cried
out
in
a
dreadful
voice
and
fell
back
from
the
ladder--where
happily
he
was
caught
by
two
of
the
men--letting
the
lantern
fall
inside
the
tree
he
was
in
a
dead
faint
and
it
was
some
time
before
any
word
could
be
got
from
him
by
then
they
had
something
else
to
look
at
the
lantern
must
have
broken
at
the
bottom
and
the
light
in
it
caught
upon
dry
leaves
and
rubbish
that
lay
there
for
in
a
few
minutes
a
dense
smoke
began
to
come
up
and
then
flame
and
to
be
short
the
tree
was
in
a
blaze
the
bystanders
made
a
ring
at
some
yards'
distance
and
sir
william
and
the
bishop
sent
men
to
get
what
weapons
and
tools
they
could
for
clearly
whatever
might
be
using
the
tree
as
its
lair
would
be
forced
out
by
the
fire
so
it
was
first
at
the
fork
they
saw
a
round
body
covered
with
fire--the
size
of
a
man's
head--appear
very
suddenly
then
seem
to
collapse
and
fall
back
this
five
or
six
times
then
a
similar
ball
leapt
into
the
air
and
fell
on
the
grass
where
after
a
moment
it
lay
still
the
bishop
went
as
near
as
he
dared
to
it
and
saw--what
but
the
remains
of
an
enormous
spider
veinous
and
seared
and
as
the
fire
burned
lower
down
more
terrible
bodies
like
this
began
to
break
out
from
the
trunk
and
it
was
seen
that
these
were
covered
with
greyish
hair
all
that
day
the
ash
burned
and
until
it
fell
to
pieces
the
men
stood
about
it
and
from
time
to
time
killed
the
brutes
as
they
darted
out
at
last
there
was
a
long
interval
when
none
appeared
and
they
cautiously
closed
in
and
examined
the
roots
of
the
tree
'they
found'
says
the
bishop
of
kilmore
'below
it
a
rounded
hollow
place
in
the
earth
wherein
were
two
or
three
bodies
of
these
creatures
that
had
plainly
been
smothered
by
the
smoke
and
what
is
to
me
more
curious
at
the
side
of
this
den
against
the
wall
was
crouching
the
anatomy
or
skeleton
of
a
human
being
with
the
skin
dried
upon
the
bones
having
some
remains
of
black
hair
which
was
pronounced
by
those
that
examined
it
to
be
undoubtedly
the
body
of
a
woman
and
clearly
dead
for
a
period
of
fifty
years'
number
13
among
the
towns
of
jutland
viborg
justly
holds
a
high
place
it
is
the
seat
of
a
bishopric
it
has
a
handsome
but
almost
entirely
new
cathedral
a
charming
garden
a
lake
of
great
beauty
and
many
storks
near
it
is
hald
accounted
one
of
the
prettiest
things
in
denmark
and
hard
by
is
finderup
where
marsk
stig
murdered
king
erik
glipping
on
st
cecilia's
day
in
the
year
1286
fifty-six
blows
of
square-headed
iron
maces
were
traced
on
erik's
skull
when
his
tomb
was
opened
in
the
seventeenth
century
but
i
am
not
writing
a
guide-book
there
are
good
hotels
in
viborg--preisler's
and
the
phoenix
are
all
that
can
be
desired
but
my
cousin
whose
experiences
i
have
to
tell
you
now
went
to
the
golden
lion
the
first
time
that
he
visited
viborg
he
has
not
been
there
since
and
the
following
pages
will
perhaps
explain
the
reason
of
his
abstention
the
golden
lion
is
one
of
the
very
few
houses
in
the
town
that
were
not
destroyed
in
the
great
fire
of
1726
which
practically
demolished
the
cathedral
the
sognekirke
the
raadhuus
and
so
much
else
that
was
old
and
interesting
it
is
a
great
red-brick
house--that
is
the
front
is
of
brick
with
corbie
steps
on
the
gables
and
a
text
over
the
door
but
the
courtyard
into
which
the
omnibus
drives
is
of
black
and
white
wood
and
plaster
the
sun
was
declining
in
the
heavens
when
my
cousin
walked
up
to
the
door
and
the
light
smote
full
upon
the
imposing
faã§ade
of
the
house
he
was
delighted
with
the
old-fashioned
aspect
of
the
place
and
promised
himself
a
thoroughly
satisfactory
and
amusing
stay
in
an
inn
so
typical
of
old
jutland
it
was
not
business
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
that
had
brought
mr
anderson
to
viborg
he
was
engaged
upon
some
researches
into
the
church
history
of
denmark
and
it
had
come
to
his
knowledge
that
in
the
rigsarkiv
of
viborg
there
were
papers
saved
from
the
fire
relating
to
the
last
days
of
roman
catholicism
in
the
country
he
proposed
therefore
to
spend
a
considerable
time--perhaps
as
much
as
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks--in
examining
and
copying
these
and
he
hoped
that
the
golden
lion
would
be
able
to
give
him
a
room
of
sufficient
size
to
serve
alike
as
a
bedroom
and
a
study
his
wishes
were
explained
to
the
landlord
and
after
a
certain
amount
of
thought
the
latter
suggested
that
perhaps
it
might
be
the
best
way
for
the
gentleman
to
look
at
one
or
two
of
the
larger
rooms
and
pick
one
for
himself
it
seemed
a
good
idea
the
top
floor
was
soon
rejected
as
entailing
too
much
getting
upstairs
after
the
day's
work
the
second
floor
contained
no
room
of
exactly
the
dimensions
required
but
on
the
first
floor
there
was
a
choice
of
two
or
three
rooms
which
would
so
far
as
size
went
suit
admirably
the
landlord
was
strongly
in
favour
of
number
17
but
mr
anderson
pointed
out
that
its
windows
commanded
only
the
blank
wall
of
the
next
house
and
that
it
would
be
very
dark
in
the
afternoon
either
number
12
or
number
14
would
be
better
for
both
of
them
looked
on
the
street
and
the
bright
evening
light
and
the
pretty
view
would
more
than
compensate
him
for
the
additional
amount
of
noise
eventually
number
12
was
selected
like
its
neighbours
it
had
three
windows
all
on
one
side
of
the
room
it
was
fairly
high
and
unusually
long
there
was
of
course
no
fireplace
but
the
stove
was
handsome
and
rather
old--a
cast-iron
erection
on
the
side
of
which
was
a
representation
of
abraham
sacrificing
isaac
and
the
inscription
'i
bog
mose
cap
22'
above
nothing
else
in
the
room
was
remarkable
the
only
interesting
picture
was
an
old
coloured
print
of
the
town
date
about
1820
supper-time
was
approaching
but
when
anderson
refreshed
by
the
ordinary
ablutions
descended
the
staircase
there
were
still
a
few
minutes
before
the
bell
rang
he
devoted
them
to
examining
the
list
of
his
fellow-lodgers
as
is
usual
in
denmark
their
names
were
displayed
on
a
large
blackboard
divided
into
columns
and
lines
the
numbers
of
the
rooms
being
painted
in
at
the
beginning
of
each
line
the
list
was
not
exciting
there
was
an
advocate
or
sagfã¶rer
a
german
and
some
bagmen
from
copenhagen
the
one
and
only
point
which
suggested
any
food
for
thought
was
the
absence
of
any
number
13
from
the
tale
of
the
rooms
and
even
this
was
a
thing
which
anderson
had
already
noticed
half
a
dozen
times
in
his
experience
of
danish
hotels
he
could
not
help
wondering
whether
the
objection
to
that
particular
number
common
as
it
is
was
so
widespread
and
so
strong
as
to
make
it
difficult
to
let
a
room
so
ticketed
and
he
resolved
to
ask
the
landlord
if
he
and
his
colleagues
in
the
profession
had
actually
met
with
many
clients
who
refused
to
be
accommodated
in
the
thirteenth
room
he
had
nothing
to
tell
me
i
am
giving
the
story
as
i
heard
it
from
him
about
what
passed
at
supper
and
the
evening
which
was
spent
in
unpacking
and
arranging
his
clothes
books
and
papers
was
not
more
eventful
towards
eleven
o'clock
he
resolved
to
go
to
bed
but
with
him
as
with
a
good
many
other
people
nowadays
an
almost
necessary
preliminary
to
bed
if
he
meant
to
sleep
was
the
reading
of
a
few
pages
of
print
and
he
now
remembered
that
the
particular
book
which
he
had
been
reading
in
the
train
and
which
alone
would
satisfy
him
at
that
present
moment
was
in
the
pocket
of
his
great-coat
then
hanging
on
a
peg
outside
the
dining-room
to
run
down
and
secure
it
was
the
work
of
a
moment
and
as
the
passages
were
by
no
means
dark
it
was
not
difficult
for
him
to
find
his
way
back
to
his
own
door
so
at
least
he
thought
but
when
he
arrived
there
and
turned
the
handle
the
door
entirely
refused
to
open
and
he
caught
the
sound
of
a
hasty
movement
towards
it
from
within
he
had
tried
the
wrong
door
of
course
was
his
own
room
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
he
glanced
at
the
number
it
was
13
his
room
would
be
on
the
left
and
so
it
was
and
not
before
he
had
been
in
bed
for
some
minutes
had
read
his
wonted
three
or
four
pages
of
his
book
blown
out
his
light
and
turned
over
to
go
to
sleep
did
it
occur
to
him
that
whereas
on
the
blackboard
of
the
hotel
there
had
been
no
number
13
there
was
undoubtedly
a
room
numbered
13
in
the
hotel
he
felt
rather
sorry
he
had
not
chosen
it
for
his
own
perhaps
he
might
have
done
the
landlord
a
little
service
by
occupying
it
and
given
him
the
chance
of
saying
that
a
well-born
english
gentleman
had
lived
in
it
for
three
weeks
and
liked
it
very
much
but
probably
it
was
used
as
a
servant's
room
or
something
of
the
kind
after
all
it
was
most
likely
not
so
large
or
good
a
room
as
his
own
and
he
looked
drowsily
about
the
room
which
was
fairly
perceptible
in
the
half-light
from
the
street-lamp
it
was
a
curious
effect
he
thought
rooms
usually
look
larger
in
a
dim
light
than
a
full
one
but
this
seemed
to
have
contracted
in
length
and
grown
proportionately
higher
well
well
sleep
was
more
important
than
these
vague
ruminations--and
to
sleep
he
went
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
anderson
attacked
the
rigsarkiv
of
viborg
he
was
as
one
might
expect
in
denmark
kindly
received
and
access
to
all
that
he
wished
to
see
was
made
as
easy
for
him
as
possible
the
documents
laid
before
him
were
far
more
numerous
and
interesting
than
he
had
at
all
anticipated
besides
official
papers
there
was
a
large
bundle
of
correspondence
relating
to
bishop
jã¶rgen
friis
the
last
roman
catholic
who
held
the
see
and
in
these
there
cropped
up
many
amusing
and
what
are
called
'intimate'
details
of
private
life
and
individual
character
there
was
much
talk
of
a
house
owned
by
the
bishop
but
not
inhabited
by
him
in
the
town
its
tenant
was
apparently
somewhat
of
a
scandal
and
a
stumbling-block
to
the
reforming
party
he
was
a
disgrace
they
wrote
to
the
city
he
practised
secret
and
wicked
arts
and
had
sold
his
soul
to
the
enemy
it
was
of
a
piece
with
the
gross
corruption
and
superstition
of
the
babylonish
church
that
such
a
viper
and
blood-sucking
troldmand
should
be
patronized
and
harboured
by
the
bishop
the
bishop
met
these
reproaches
boldly
he
protested
his
own
abhorrence
of
all
such
things
as
secret
arts
and
required
his
antagonists
to
bring
the
matter
before
the
proper
court--of
course
the
spiritual
court--and
sift
it
to
the
bottom
no
one
could
be
more
ready
and
willing
than
himself
to
condemn
mag
nicolas
francken
if
the
evidence
showed
him
to
have
been
guilty
of
any
of
the
crimes
informally
alleged
against
him
anderson
had
not
time
to
do
more
than
glance
at
the
next
letter
of
the
protestant
leader
rasmus
nielsen
before
the
record
office
was
closed
for
the
day
but
he
gathered
its
general
tenor
which
was
to
the
effect
that
christian
men
were
now
no
longer
bound
by
the
decisions
of
bishops
of
rome
and
that
the
bishop's
court
was
not
and
could
not
be
a
fit
or
competent
tribunal
to
judge
so
grave
and
weighty
a
cause
on
leaving
the
office
mr
anderson
was
accompanied
by
the
old
gentleman
who
presided
over
it
and
as
they
walked
the
conversation
very
naturally
turned
to
the
papers
of
which
i
have
just
been
speaking
herr
scavenius
the
archivist
of
viborg
though
very
well
informed
as
to
the
general
run
of
the
documents
under
his
charge
was
not
a
specialist
in
those
of
the
reformation
period
he
was
much
interested
in
what
anderson
had
to
tell
him
about
them
he
looked
forward
with
great
pleasure
he
said
to
seeing
the
publication
in
which
mr
anderson
spoke
of
embodying
their
contents
'this
house
of
the
bishop
friis'
he
added
'it
is
a
great
puzzle
to
me
where
it
can
have
stood
i
have
studied
carefully
the
topography
of
old
viborg
but
it
is
most
unlucky--of
the
old
terrier
of
the
bishop's
property
which
was
made
in
1560
and
of
which
we
have
the
greater
part
in
the
arkiv--just
the
piece
which
had
the
list
of
the
town
property
is
missing
never
mind
perhaps
i
shall
some
day
succeed
to
find
him'
after
taking
some
exercise--i
forget
exactly
how
or
where--anderson
went
back
to
the
golden
lion
his
supper
his
game
of
patience
and
his
bed
on
the
way
to
his
room
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
forgotten
to
talk
to
the
landlord
about
the
omission
of
number
13
from
the
hotel
board
and
also
that
he
might
as
well
make
sure
that
number
13
did
actually
exist
before
he
made
any
reference
to
the
matter
the
decision
was
not
difficult
to
arrive
at
there
was
the
door
with
its
number
as
plain
as
could
be
and
work
of
some
kind
was
evidently
going
on
inside
it
for
as
he
neared
the
door
he
could
hear
footsteps
and
voices
or
a
voice
within
during
the
few
seconds
in
which
he
halted
to
make
sure
of
the
number
the
footsteps
ceased
seemingly
very
near
the
door
and
he
was
a
little
startled
at
hearing
a
quick
hissing
breathing
as
of
a
person
in
strong
excitement
he
went
on
to
his
own
room
and
again
he
was
surprised
to
find
how
much
smaller
it
seemed
now
than
it
had
when
he
selected
it
it
was
a
slight
disappointment
but
only
slight
if
he
found
it
really
not
large
enough
he
could
very
easily
shift
to
another
in
the
meantime
he
wanted
something--as
far
as
i
remember
it
was
a
pocket-handkerchief--out
of
his
portmanteau
which
had
been
placed
by
the
porter
on
a
very
inadequate
trestle
or
stool
against
the
wall
at
the
farthest
end
of
the
room
from
his
bed
here
was
a
very
curious
thing
the
portmanteau
was
not
to
be
seen
it
had
been
moved
by
officious
servants
doubtless
the
contents
had
been
put
in
the
wardrobe
no
none
of
them
were
there
this
was
vexatious
the
idea
of
a
theft
he
dismissed
at
once
such
things
rarely
happen
in
denmark
but
some
piece
of
stupidity
had
certainly
been
performed
which
is
not
so
uncommon
and
the
stuepige
must
be
severely
spoken
to
whatever
it
was
that
he
wanted
it
was
not
so
necessary
to
his
comfort
that
he
could
not
wait
till
the
morning
for
it
and
he
therefore
settled
not
to
ring
the
bell
and
disturb
the
servants
he
went
to
the
window--the
right-hand
window
it
was--and
looked
out
on
the
quiet
street
there
was
a
tall
building
opposite
with
large
spaces
of
dead
wall
no
passers-by
a
dark
night
and
very
little
to
be
seen
of
any
kind
the
light
was
behind
him
and
he
could
see
his
own
shadow
clearly
cast
on
the
wall
opposite
also
the
shadow
of
the
bearded
man
in
number
11
on
the
left
who
passed
to
and
fro
in
shirtsleeves
once
or
twice
and
was
seen
first
brushing
his
hair
and
later
on
in
a
nightgown
also
the
shadow
of
the
occupant
of
number
13
on
the
right
this
might
be
more
interesting
number
13
was
like
himself
leaning
on
his
elbows
on
the
window-sill
looking
out
into
the
street
he
seemed
to
be
a
tall
thin
man--or
was
it
by
any
chance
a
woman--at
least
it
was
someone
who
covered
his
or
her
head
with
some
kind
of
drapery
before
going
to
bed
and
he
thought
must
be
possessed
of
a
red
lamp-shade--and
the
lamp
must
be
flickering
very
much
there
was
a
distinct
playing
up
and
down
of
a
dull
red
light
on
the
opposite
wall
he
craned
out
a
little
to
see
if
he
could
make
any
more
of
the
figure
but
beyond
a
fold
of
some
light
perhaps
white
material
on
the
window-sill
he
could
see
nothing
now
came
a
distant
step
in
the
street
and
its
approach
seemed
to
recall
number
13
to
a
sense
of
his
exposed
position
for
very
swiftly
and
suddenly
he
swept
aside
from
the
window
and
his
red
light
went
out
anderson
who
had
been
smoking
a
cigarette
laid
the
end
of
it
on
the
window-sill
and
went
to
bed
next
morning
he
was
woken
by
the
stuepige
with
hot
water
etc
he
roused
himself
and
after
thinking
out
the
correct
danish
words
said
as
distinctly
as
he
could
'you
must
not
move
my
portmanteau
where
is
it'
as
is
not
uncommon
the
maid
laughed
and
went
away
without
making
any
distinct
answer
anderson
rather
irritated
sat
up
in
bed
intending
to
call
her
back
but
he
remained
sitting
up
staring
straight
in
front
of
him
there
was
his
portmanteau
on
its
trestle
exactly
where
he
had
seen
the
porter
put
it
when
he
first
arrived
this
was
a
rude
shock
for
a
man
who
prided
himself
on
his
accuracy
of
observation
how
it
could
possibly
have
escaped
him
the
night
before
he
did
not
pretend
to
understand
at
any
rate
there
it
was
now
the
daylight
showed
more
than
the
portmanteau
it
let
the
true
proportions
of
the
room
with
its
three
windows
appear
and
satisfied
its
tenant
that
his
choice
after
all
had
not
been
a
bad
one
when
he
was
almost
dressed
he
walked
to
the
middle
one
of
the
three
windows
to
look
out
at
the
weather
another
shock
awaited
him
strangely
unobservant
he
must
have
been
last
night
he
could
have
sworn
ten
times
over
that
he
had
been
smoking
at
the
right-hand
window
the
last
thing
before
he
went
to
bed
and
here
was
his
cigarette-end
on
the
sill
of
the
middle
window
he
started
to
go
down
to
breakfast
rather
late
but
number
13
was
later
here
were
his
boots
still
outside
his
door--a
gentleman's
boots
so
then
number
13
was
a
man
not
a
woman
just
then
he
caught
sight
of
the
number
on
the
door
it
was
14
he
thought
he
must
have
passed
number
13
without
noticing
it
three
stupid
mistakes
in
twelve
hours
were
too
much
for
a
methodical
accurate-minded
man
so
he
turned
back
to
make
sure
the
next
number
to
14
was
number
12
his
own
room
there
was
no
number
13
at
all
after
some
minutes
devoted
to
a
careful
consideration
of
everything
he
had
had
to
eat
and
drink
during
the
last
twenty-four
hours
anderson
decided
to
give
the
question
up
if
his
eyes
or
his
brain
were
giving
way
he
would
have
plenty
of
opportunities
for
ascertaining
that
fact
if
not
then
he
was
evidently
being
treated
to
a
very
interesting
experience
in
either
case
the
development
of
events
would
certainly
be
worth
watching
during
the
day
he
continued
his
examination
of
the
episcopal
correspondence
which
i
have
already
summarized
to
his
disappointment
it
was
incomplete
only
one
other
letter
could
be
found
which
referred
to
the
affair
of
mag
nicolas
francken
it
was
from
the
bishop
jã¶rgen
friis
to
rasmus
nielsen
he
said
'although
we
are
not
in
the
least
degree
inclined
to
assent
to
your
judgement
concerning
our
court
and
shall
be
prepared
if
need
be
to
withstand
you
to
the
uttermost
in
that
behalf
yet
forasmuch
as
our
trusty
and
well-beloved
mag
nicolas
francken
against
whom
you
have
dared
to
allege
certain
false
and
malicious
charges
hath
been
suddenly
removed
from
among
us
it
is
apparent
that
the
question
for
this
time
falls
but
forasmuch
as
you
further
allege
that
the
apostle
and
evangelist
st
john
in
his
heavenly
apocalypse
describes
the
holy
roman
church
under
the
guise
and
symbol
of
the
scarlet
woman
be
it
known
to
you'
etc
search
as
he
might
anderson
could
find
no
sequel
to
this
letter
nor
any
clue
to
the
cause
or
manner
of
the
'removal'
of
the
casus
belli
he
could
only
suppose
that
francken
had
died
suddenly
and
as
there
were
only
two
days
between
the
date
of
nielsen's
last
letter--when
francken
was
evidently
still
in
being--and
that
of
the
bishop's
letter
the
death
must
have
been
completely
unexpected
in
the
afternoon
he
paid
a
short
visit
to
hald
and
took
his
tea
at
baekkelund
nor
could
he
notice
though
he
was
in
a
somewhat
nervous
frame
of
mind
that
there
was
any
indication
of
such
a
failure
of
eye
or
brain
as
his
experiences
of
the
morning
had
led
him
to
fear
at
supper
he
found
himself
next
to
the
landlord
'what'
he
asked
him
after
some
indifferent
conversation
'is
the
reason
why
in
most
of
the
hotels
one
visits
in
this
country
the
number
thirteen
is
left
out
of
the
list
of
rooms
i
see
you
have
none
here'
the
landlord
seemed
amused
'to
think
that
you
should
have
noticed
a
thing
like
that
i've
thought
about
it
once
or
twice
myself
to
tell
the
truth
an
educated
man
i've
said
has
no
business
with
these
superstitious
notions
i
was
brought
up
myself
here
in
the
high
school
of
viborg
and
our
old
master
was
always
a
man
to
set
his
face
against
anything
of
that
kind
he's
been
dead
now
this
many
years--a
fine
upstanding
man
he
was
and
ready
with
his
hands
as
well
as
his
head
i
recollect
us
boys
one
snowy
day--'
here
he
plunged
into
reminiscence
'then
you
don't
think
there
is
any
particular
objection
to
having
a
number
13'
said
anderson
'ah
to
be
sure
well
you
understand
i
was
brought
up
to
the
business
by
my
poor
old
father
he
kept
an
hotel
in
aarhuus
first
and
then
when
we
were
born
he
moved
to
viborg
here
which
was
his
native
place
and
had
the
phoenix
here
until
he
died
that
was
in
1876
then
i
started
business
in
silkeborg
and
only
the
year
before
last
i
moved
into
this
house'
then
followed
more
details
as
to
the
state
of
the
house
and
business
when
first
taken
over
'and
when
you
came
here
was
there
a
number
13'
'no
no
i
was
going
to
tell
you
about
that
you
see
in
a
place
like
this
the
commercial
class--the
travellers--are
what
we
have
to
provide
for
in
general
and
put
them
in
number
13
why
they'd
as
soon
sleep
in
the
street
or
sooner
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
myself
it
wouldn't
make
a
penny
difference
to
me
what
the
number
of
my
room
was
and
so
i've
often
said
to
them
but
they
stick
to
it
that
it
brings
them
bad
luck
quantities
of
stories
they
have
among
them
of
men
that
have
slept
in
a
number
13
and
never
been
the
same
again
or
lost
their
best
customers
or--one
thing
and
another'
said
the
landlord
after
searching
for
a
more
graphic
phrase
'then
what
do
you
use
your
number
13
for'
said
anderson
conscious
as
he
said
the
words
of
a
curious
anxiety
quite
disproportionate
to
the
importance
of
the
question
'my
number
13
why
don't
i
tell
you
that
there
isn't
such
a
thing
in
the
house
i
thought
you
might
have
noticed
that
if
there
was
it
would
be
next
door
to
your
own
room'
'well
yes
only
i
happened
to
think--that
is
i
fancied
last
night
that
i
had
seen
a
door
numbered
thirteen
in
that
passage
and
really
i
am
almost
certain
i
must
have
been
right
for
i
saw
it
the
night
before
as
well'
of
course
herr
kristensen
laughed
this
notion
to
scorn
as
anderson
had
expected
and
emphasized
with
much
iteration
the
fact
that
no
number
13
existed
or
had
existed
before
him
in
that
hotel
anderson
was
in
some
ways
relieved
by
his
certainty
but
still
puzzled
and
he
began
to
think
that
the
best
way
to
make
sure
whether
he
had
indeed
been
subject
to
an
illusion
or
not
was
to
invite
the
landlord
to
his
room
to
smoke
a
cigar
later
on
in
the
evening
some
photographs
of
english
towns
which
he
had
with
him
formed
a
sufficiently
good
excuse
herr
kristensen
was
flattered
by
the
invitation
and
most
willingly
accepted
it
at
about
ten
o'clock
he
was
to
make
his
appearance
but
before
that
anderson
had
some
letters
to
write
and
retired
for
the
purpose
of
writing
them
he
almost
blushed
to
himself
at
confessing
it
but
he
could
not
deny
that
it
was
the
fact
that
he
was
becoming
quite
nervous
about
the
question
of
the
existence
of
number
13
so
much
so
that
he
approached
his
room
by
way
of
number
11
in
order
that
he
might
not
be
obliged
to
pass
the
door
or
the
place
where
the
door
ought
to
be
he
looked
quickly
and
suspiciously
about
the
room
when
he
entered
it
but
there
was
nothing
beyond
that
indefinable
air
of
being
smaller
than
usual
to
warrant
any
misgivings
there
was
no
question
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
his
portmanteau
tonight
he
had
himself
emptied
it
of
its
contents
and
lodged
it
under
his
bed
with
a
certain
effort
he
dismissed
the
thought
of
number
13
from
his
mind
and
sat
down
to
his
writing
his
neighbours
were
quiet
enough
occasionally
a
door
opened
in
the
passage
and
a
pair
of
boots
was
thrown
out
or
a
bagman
walked
past
humming
to
himself
and
outside
from
time
to
time
a
cart
thundered
over
the
atrocious
cobble-stones
or
a
quick
step
hurried
along
the
flags
anderson
finished
his
letters
ordered
in
whisky
and
soda
and
then
went
to
the
window
and
studied
the
dead
wall
opposite
and
the
shadows
upon
it
as
far
as
he
could
remember
number
14
had
been
occupied
by
the
lawyer
a
staid
man
who
said
little
at
meals
being
generally
engaged
in
studying
a
small
bundle
of
papers
beside
his
plate
apparently
however
he
was
in
the
habit
of
giving
vent
to
his
animal
spirits
when
alone
why
else
should
he
be
dancing
the
shadow
from
the
next
room
evidently
showed
that
he
was
again
and
again
his
thin
form
crossed
the
window
his
arms
waved
and
a
gaunt
leg
was
kicked
up
with
surprising
agility
he
seemed
to
be
barefooted
and
the
floor
must
be
well
laid
for
no
sound
betrayed
his
movements
sagfã¶rer
herr
anders
jensen
dancing
at
ten
o'clock
at
night
in
a
hotel
bedroom
seemed
a
fitting
subject
for
a
historical
painting
in
the
grand
style
and
anderson's
thoughts
like
those
of
emily
in
the
'mysteries
of
udolpho'
began
to
'arrange
themselves
in
the
following
lines'
when
i
return
to
my
hotel
at
ten
o'clock
pm
the
waiters
think
i
am
unwell
i
do
not
care
for
them
but
when
i've
locked
my
chamber
door
and
put
my
boots
outside
i
dance
all
night
upon
the
floor
and
even
if
my
neighbours
swore
i'd
go
on
dancing
all
the
more
for
i'm
acquainted
with
the
law
and
in
despite
of
all
their
jaw
their
protests
i
deride
had
not
the
landlord
at
this
moment
knocked
at
the
door
it
is
probable
that
quite
a
long
poem
might
have
been
laid
before
the
reader
to
judge
from
his
look
of
surprise
when
he
found
himself
in
the
room
herr
kristensen
was
struck
as
anderson
had
been
by
something
unusual
in
its
aspect
but
he
made
no
remark
anderson's
photographs
interested
him
mightily
and
formed
the
text
of
many
autobiographical
discourses
nor
is
it
quite
clear
how
the
conversation
could
have
been
diverted
into
the
desired
channel
of
number
13
had
not
the
lawyer
at
this
moment
begun
to
sing
and
to
sing
in
a
manner
which
could
leave
no
doubt
in
anyone's
mind
that
he
was
either
exceedingly
drunk
or
raving
mad
it
was
a
high
thin
voice
that
they
heard
and
it
seemed
dry
as
if
from
long
disuse
of
words
or
tune
there
was
no
question
it
went
sailing
up
to
a
surprising
height
and
was
carried
down
with
a
despairing
moan
as
of
a
winter
wind
in
a
hollow
chimney
or
an
organ
whose
wind
fails
suddenly
it
was
a
really
horrible
sound
and
anderson
felt
that
if
he
had
been
alone
he
must
have
fled
for
refuge
and
society
to
some
neighbour
bagman's
room
the
landlord
sat
open-mouthed
'i
don't
understand
it'
he
said
at
last
wiping
his
forehead
'it
is
dreadful
i
have
heard
it
once
before
but
i
made
sure
it
was
a
cat'
'is
he
mad'
said
anderson
'he
must
be
and
what
a
sad
thing
such
a
good
customer
too
and
so
successful
in
his
business
by
what
i
hear
and
a
young
family
to
bring
up'
just
then
came
an
impatient
knock
at
the
door
and
the
knocker
entered
without
waiting
to
be
asked
it
was
the
lawyer
in
dã©shabille
and
very
rough-haired
and
very
angry
he
looked
'i
beg
pardon
sir'
he
said
'but
i
should
be
much
obliged
if
you
would
kindly
desist--'
here
he
stopped
for
it
was
evident
that
neither
of
the
persons
before
him
was
responsible
for
the
disturbance
and
after
a
moment's
lull
it
swelled
forth
again
more
wildly
than
before
'but
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
does
it
mean'
broke
out
the
lawyer
'where
is
it
who
is
it
am
i
going
out
of
my
mind'
'surely
herr
jensen
it
comes
from
your
room
next
door
isn't
there
a
cat
or
something
stuck
in
the
chimney'
this
was
the
best
that
occurred
to
anderson
to
say
and
he
realized
its
futility
as
he
spoke
but
anything
was
better
than
to
stand
and
listen
to
that
horrible
voice
and
look
at
the
broad
white
face
of
the
landlord
all
perspiring
and
quivering
as
he
clutched
the
arms
of
his
chair
'impossible'
said
the
lawyer
'impossible
there
is
no
chimney
i
came
here
because
i
was
convinced
the
noise
was
going
on
here
it
was
certainly
in
the
next
room
to
mine'
'was
there
no
door
between
yours
and
mine'
said
anderson
eagerly
'no
sir'
said
herr
jensen
rather
sharply
'at
least
not
this
morning'
'ah'
said
anderson
'nor
tonight'
'i
am
not
sure'
said
the
lawyer
with
some
hesitation
suddenly
the
crying
or
singing
voice
in
the
next
room
died
away
and
the
singer
was
heard
seemingly
to
laugh
to
himself
in
a
crooning
manner
the
three
men
actually
shivered
at
the
sound
then
there
was
a
silence
'come'
said
the
lawyer
'what
have
you
to
say
herr
kristensen
what
does
this
mean'
'good
heaven'
said
kristensen
'how
should
i
tell
i
know
no
more
than
you
gentlemen
i
pray
i
may
never
hear
such
a
noise
again'
'so
do
i'
said
herr
jensen
and
he
added
something
under
his
breath
anderson
thought
it
sounded
like
the
last
words
of
the
psalter
'omnis
spiritus
laudet
dominum'
but
he
could
not
be
sure
'but
we
must
do
something'
said
anderson--'the
three
of
us
shall
we
go
and
investigate
in
the
next
room'
'but
that
is
herr
jensen's
room'
wailed
the
landlord
'it
is
no
use
he
has
come
from
there
himself'
'i
am
not
so
sure'
said
jensen
'i
think
this
gentleman
is
right
we
must
go
and
see'
the
only
weapons
of
defence
that
could
be
mustered
on
the
spot
were
a
stick
and
umbrella
the
expedition
went
out
into
the
passage
not
without
quakings
there
was
a
deadly
quiet
outside
but
a
light
shone
from
under
the
next
door
anderson
and
jensen
approached
it
the
latter
turned
the
handle
and
gave
a
sudden
vigorous
push
no
use
the
door
stood
fast
'herr
kristensen'
said
jensen
'will
you
go
and
fetch
the
strongest
servant
you
have
in
the
place
we
must
see
this
through'
the
landlord
nodded
and
hurried
off
glad
to
be
away
from
the
scene
of
action
jensen
and
anderson
remained
outside
looking
at
the
door
'it
is
number
13
you
see'
said
the
latter
'yes
there
is
your
door
and
there
is
mine'
said
jensen
'my
room
has
three
windows
in
the
daytime'
said
anderson
with
difficulty
suppressing
a
nervous
laugh
'by
george
so
has
mine'
said
the
lawyer
turning
and
looking
at
anderson
his
back
was
now
to
the
door
in
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
an
arm
came
out
and
clawed
at
his
shoulder
it
was
clad
in
ragged
yellowish
linen
and
the
bare
skin
where
it
could
be
seen
had
long
grey
hair
upon
it
anderson
was
just
in
time
to
pull
jensen
out
of
its
reach
with
a
cry
of
disgust
and
fright
when
the
door
shut
again
and
a
low
laugh
was
heard
jensen
had
seen
nothing
but
when
anderson
hurriedly
told
him
what
a
risk
he
had
run
he
fell
into
a
great
state
of
agitation
and
suggested
that
they
should
retire
from
the
enterprise
and
lock
themselves
up
in
one
or
other
of
their
rooms
however
while
he
was
developing
this
plan
the
landlord
and
two
able-bodied
men
arrived
on
the
scene
all
looking
rather
serious
and
alarmed
jensen
met
them
with
a
torrent
of
description
and
explanation
which
did
not
at
all
tend
to
encourage
them
for
the
fray
the
men
dropped
the
crowbars
they
had
brought
and
said
flatly
that
they
were
not
going
to
risk
their
throats
in
that
devil's
den
the
landlord
was
miserably
nervous
and
undecided
conscious
that
if
the
danger
were
not
faced
his
hotel
was
ruined
and
very
loth
to
face
it
himself
luckily
anderson
hit
upon
a
way
of
rallying
the
demoralized
force
'is
this'
he
said
'the
danish
courage
i
have
heard
so
much
of
it
isn't
a
german
in
there
and
if
it
was
we
are
five
to
one'
the
two
servants
and
jensen
were
stung
into
action
by
this
and
made
a
dash
at
the
door
'stop'
said
anderson
'don't
lose
your
heads
you
stay
out
here
with
the
light
landlord
and
one
of
you
two
men
break
in
the
door
and
don't
go
in
when
it
gives
way'
the
men
nodded
and
the
younger
stepped
forward
raised
his
crowbar
and
dealt
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
upper
panel
the
result
was
not
in
the
least
what
any
of
them
anticipated
there
was
no
cracking
or
rending
of
wood--only
a
dull
sound
as
if
the
solid
wall
had
been
struck
the
man
dropped
his
tool
with
a
shout
and
began
rubbing
his
elbow
his
cry
drew
their
eyes
upon
him
for
a
moment
then
anderson
looked
at
the
door
again
it
was
gone
the
plaster
wall
of
the
passage
stared
him
in
the
face
with
a
considerable
gash
in
it
where
the
crowbar
had
struck
it
number
13
had
passed
out
of
existence
for
a
brief
space
they
stood
perfectly
still
gazing
at
the
blank
wall
an
early
cock
in
the
yard
beneath
was
heard
to
crow
and
as
anderson
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
he
saw
through
the
window
at
the
end
of
the
long
passage
that
the
eastern
sky
was
paling
to
the
dawn
'perhaps'
said
the
landlord
with
hesitation
'you
gentlemen
would
like
another
room
for
tonight--a
double-bedded
one'
neither
jensen
nor
anderson
was
averse
to
the
suggestion
they
felt
inclined
to
hunt
in
couples
after
their
late
experience
it
was
found
convenient
when
each
of
them
went
to
his
room
to
collect
the
articles
he
wanted
for
the
night
that
the
other
should
go
with
him
and
hold
the
candle
they
noticed
that
both
number
12
and
number
14
had
three
windows





next
morning
the
same
party
reassembled
in
number
12
the
landlord
was
naturally
anxious
to
avoid
engaging
outside
help
and
yet
it
was
imperative
that
the
mystery
attaching
to
that
part
of
the
house
should
be
cleared
up
accordingly
the
two
servants
had
been
induced
to
take
upon
them
the
function
of
carpenters
the
furniture
was
cleared
away
and
at
the
cost
of
a
good
many
irretrievably
damaged
planks
that
portion
of
the
floor
was
taken
up
which
lay
nearest
to
number
14
you
will
naturally
suppose
that
a
skeleton--say
that
of
mag
nicolas
francken--was
discovered
that
was
not
so
what
they
did
find
lying
between
the
beams
which
supported
the
flooring
was
a
small
copper
box
in
it
was
a
neatly-folded
vellum
document
with
about
twenty
lines
of
writing
both
anderson
and
jensen
who
proved
to
be
something
of
a
palaeographer
were
much
excited
by
this
discovery
which
promised
to
afford
the
key
to
these
extraordinary
phenomena





i
possess
a
copy
of
an
astrological
work
which
i
have
never
read
it
has
by
way
of
frontispiece
a
woodcut
by
hans
sebald
beham
representing
a
number
of
sages
seated
round
a
table
this
detail
may
enable
connoisseurs
to
identify
the
book
i
cannot
myself
recollect
its
title
and
it
is
not
at
this
moment
within
reach
but
the
fly-leaves
of
it
are
covered
with
writing
and
during
the
ten
years
in
which
i
have
owned
the
volume
i
have
not
been
able
to
determine
which
way
up
this
writing
ought
to
be
read
much
less
in
what
language
it
is
not
dissimilar
was
the
position
of
anderson
and
jensen
after
the
protracted
examination
to
which
they
submitted
the
document
in
the
copper
box
after
two
days'
contemplation
of
it
jensen
who
was
the
bolder
spirit
of
the
two
hazarded
the
conjecture
that
the
language
was
either
latin
or
old
danish
anderson
ventured
upon
no
surmises
and
was
very
willing
to
surrender
the
box
and
the
parchment
to
the
historical
society
of
viborg
to
be
placed
in
their
museum
i
had
the
whole
story
from
him
a
few
months
later
as
we
sat
in
a
wood
near
upsala
after
a
visit
to
the
library
there
where
we--or
rather
i--had
laughed
over
the
contract
by
which
daniel
salthenius
in
later
life
professor
of
hebrew
at
kã¶nigsberg
sold
himself
to
satan
anderson
was
not
really
amused
'young
idiot'
he
said
meaning
salthenius
who
was
only
an
undergraduate
when
he
committed
that
indiscretion
'how
did
he
know
what
company
he
was
courting'
and
when
i
suggested
the
usual
considerations
he
only
grunted
that
same
afternoon
he
told
me
what
you
have
read
but
he
refused
to
draw
any
inferences
from
it
and
to
assent
to
any
that
i
drew
for
him
count
magnus
by
what
means
the
papers
out
of
which
i
have
made
a
connected
story
came
into
my
hands
is
the
last
point
which
the
reader
will
learn
from
these
pages
but
it
is
necessary
to
prefix
to
my
extracts
from
them
a
statement
of
the
form
in
which
i
possess
them
they
consist
then
partly
of
a
series
of
collections
for
a
book
of
travels
such
a
volume
as
was
a
common
product
of
the
forties
and
fifties
horace
marryat's
journal
of
a
residence
in
jutland
and
the
danish
isles
is
a
fair
specimen
of
the
class
to
which
i
allude
these
books
usually
treated
of
some
unknown
district
on
the
continent
they
were
illustrated
with
woodcuts
or
steel
plates
they
gave
details
of
hotel
accommodation
and
of
means
of
communication
such
as
we
now
expect
to
find
in
any
well-regulated
guide-book
and
they
dealt
largely
in
reported
conversations
with
intelligent
foreigners
racy
innkeepers
and
garrulous
peasants
in
a
word
they
were
chatty
begun
with
the
idea
of
furnishing
material
for
such
a
book
my
papers
as
they
progressed
assumed
the
character
of
a
record
of
one
single
personal
experience
and
this
record
was
continued
up
to
the
very
eve
almost
of
its
termination
the
writer
was
a
mr
wraxall
for
my
knowledge
of
him
i
have
to
depend
entirely
on
the
evidence
his
writings
afford
and
from
these
i
deduce
that
he
was
a
man
past
middle
age
possessed
of
some
private
means
and
very
much
alone
in
the
world
he
had
it
seems
no
settled
abode
in
england
but
was
a
denizen
of
hotels
and
boarding-houses
it
is
probable
that
he
entertained
the
idea
of
settling
down
at
some
future
time
which
never
came
and
i
think
it
also
likely
that
the
pantechnicon
fire
in
the
early
seventies
must
have
destroyed
a
great
deal
that
would
have
thrown
light
on
his
antecedents
for
he
refers
once
or
twice
to
property
of
his
that
was
warehoused
at
that
establishment
it
is
further
apparent
that
mr
wraxall
had
published
a
book
and
that
it
treated
of
a
holiday
he
had
once
taken
in
brittany
more
than
this
i
cannot
say
about
his
work
because
a
diligent
search
in
bibliographical
works
has
convinced
me
that
it
must
have
appeared
either
anonymously
or
under
a
pseudonym
as
to
his
character
it
is
not
difficult
to
form
some
superficial
opinion
he
must
have
been
an
intelligent
and
cultivated
man
it
seems
that
he
was
near
being
a
fellow
of
his
college
at
oxford--brasenose
as
i
judge
from
the
calendar
his
besetting
fault
was
pretty
clearly
that
of
over-inquisitiveness
possibly
a
good
fault
in
a
traveller
certainly
a
fault
for
which
this
traveller
paid
dearly
enough
in
the
end
on
what
proved
to
be
his
last
expedition
he
was
plotting
another
book
scandinavia
a
region
not
widely
known
to
englishmen
forty
years
ago
had
struck
him
as
an
interesting
field
he
must
have
alighted
on
some
old
books
of
swedish
history
or
memoirs
and
the
idea
had
struck
him
that
there
was
room
for
a
book
descriptive
of
travel
in
sweden
interspersed
with
episodes
from
the
history
of
some
of
the
great
swedish
families
he
procured
letters
of
introduction
therefore
to
some
persons
of
quality
in
sweden
and
set
out
thither
in
the
early
summer
of
1863
of
his
travels
in
the
north
there
is
no
need
to
speak
nor
of
his
residence
of
some
weeks
in
stockholm
i
need
only
mention
that
some
savant
resident
there
put
him
on
the
track
of
an
important
collection
of
family
papers
belonging
to
the
proprietors
of
an
ancient
manor-house
in
vestergothland
and
obtained
for
him
permission
to
examine
them
the
manor-house
or
herrgard
in
question
is
to
be
called
rã¥bã¤ck
pronounced
something
like
roebeck
though
that
is
not
its
name
it
is
one
of
the
best
buildings
of
its
kind
in
all
the
country
and
the
picture
of
it
in
dahlenberg's
suecia
antiqua
et
moderna
engraved
in
1694
shows
it
very
much
as
the
tourist
may
see
it
today
it
was
built
soon
after
1600
and
is
roughly
speaking
very
much
like
an
english
house
of
that
period
in
respect
of
material--red-brick
with
stone
facings--and
style
the
man
who
built
it
was
a
scion
of
the
great
house
of
de
la
gardie
and
his
descendants
possess
it
still
de
la
gardie
is
the
name
by
which
i
will
designate
them
when
mention
of
them
becomes
necessary
they
received
mr
wraxall
with
great
kindness
and
courtesy
and
pressed
him
to
stay
in
the
house
as
long
as
his
researches
lasted
but
preferring
to
be
independent
and
mistrusting
his
powers
of
conversing
in
swedish
he
settled
himself
at
the
village
inn
which
turned
out
quite
sufficiently
comfortable
at
any
rate
during
the
summer
months
this
arrangement
would
entail
a
short
walk
daily
to
and
from
the
manor-house
of
something
under
a
mile
the
house
itself
stood
in
a
park
and
was
protected--we
should
say
grown
up--with
large
old
timber
near
it
you
found
the
walled
garden
and
then
entered
a
close
wood
fringing
one
of
the
small
lakes
with
which
the
whole
country
is
pitted
then
came
the
wall
of
the
demesne
and
you
climbed
a
steep
knoll--a
knob
of
rock
lightly
covered
with
soil--and
on
the
top
of
this
stood
the
church
fenced
in
with
tall
dark
trees
it
was
a
curious
building
to
english
eyes
the
nave
and
aisles
were
low
and
filled
with
pews
and
galleries
in
the
western
gallery
stood
the
handsome
old
organ
gaily
painted
and
with
silver
pipes
the
ceiling
was
flat
and
had
been
adorned
by
a
seventeenth-century
artist
with
a
strange
and
hideous
'last
judgement'
full
of
lurid
flames
falling
cities
burning
ships
crying
souls
and
brown
and
smiling
demons
handsome
brass
coronae
hung
from
the
roof
the
pulpit
was
like
a
doll's-house
covered
with
little
painted
wooden
cherubs
and
saints
a
stand
with
three
hour-glasses
was
hinged
to
the
preacher's
desk
such
sights
as
these
may
be
seen
in
many
a
church
in
sweden
now
but
what
distinguished
this
one
was
an
addition
to
the
original
building
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
north
aisle
the
builder
of
the
manor-house
had
erected
a
mausoleum
for
himself
and
his
family
it
was
a
largish
eight-sided
building
lighted
by
a
series
of
oval
windows
and
it
had
a
domed
roof
topped
by
a
kind
of
pumpkin-shaped
object
rising
into
a
spire
a
form
in
which
swedish
architects
greatly
delighted
the
roof
was
of
copper
externally
and
was
painted
black
while
the
walls
in
common
with
those
of
the
church
were
staringly
white
to
this
mausoleum
there
was
no
access
from
the
church
it
had
a
portal
and
steps
of
its
own
on
the
northern
side
past
the
churchyard
the
path
to
the
village
goes
and
not
more
than
three
or
four
minutes
bring
you
to
the
inn
door
on
the
first
day
of
his
stay
at
rã¥bã¤ck
mr
wraxall
found
the
church
door
open
and
made
these
notes
of
the
interior
which
i
have
epitomized
into
the
mausoleum
however
he
could
not
make
his
way
he
could
by
looking
through
the
keyhole
just
descry
that
there
were
fine
marble
effigies
and
sarcophagi
of
copper
and
a
wealth
of
armorial
ornament
which
made
him
very
anxious
to
spend
some
time
in
investigation
the
papers
he
had
come
to
examine
at
the
manor-house
proved
to
be
of
just
the
kind
he
wanted
for
his
book
there
were
family
correspondence
journals
and
account-books
of
the
earliest
owners
of
the
estate
very
carefully
kept
and
clearly
written
full
of
amusing
and
picturesque
detail
the
first
de
la
gardie
appeared
in
them
as
a
strong
and
capable
man
shortly
after
the
building
of
the
mansion
there
had
been
a
period
of
distress
in
the
district
and
the
peasants
had
risen
and
attacked
several
chã¢teaux
and
done
some
damage
the
owner
of
rã¥bã¤ck
took
a
leading
part
in
supressing
trouble
and
there
was
reference
to
executions
of
ring-leaders
and
severe
punishments
inflicted
with
no
sparing
hand
the
portrait
of
this
magnus
de
la
gardie
was
one
of
the
best
in
the
house
and
mr
wraxall
studied
it
with
no
little
interest
after
his
day's
work
he
gives
no
detailed
description
of
it
but
i
gather
that
the
face
impressed
him
rather
by
its
power
than
by
its
beauty
or
goodness
in
fact
he
writes
that
count
magnus
was
an
almost
phenomenally
ugly
man
on
this
day
mr
wraxall
took
his
supper
with
the
family
and
walked
back
in
the
late
but
still
bright
evening
'i
must
remember'
he
writes
'to
ask
the
sexton
if
he
can
let
me
into
the
mausoleum
at
the
church
he
evidently
has
access
to
it
himself
for
i
saw
him
tonight
standing
on
the
steps
and
as
i
thought
locking
or
unlocking
the
door'
i
find
that
early
on
the
following
day
mr
wraxall
had
some
conversation
with
his
landlord
his
setting
it
down
at
such
length
as
he
does
surprised
me
at
first
but
i
soon
realized
that
the
papers
i
was
reading
were
at
least
in
their
beginning
the
materials
for
the
book
he
was
meditating
and
that
it
was
to
have
been
one
of
those
quasi-journalistic
productions
which
admit
of
the
introduction
of
an
admixture
of
conversational
matter
his
object
he
says
was
to
find
out
whether
any
traditions
of
count
magnus
de
la
gardie
lingered
on
in
the
scenes
of
that
gentleman's
activity
and
whether
the
popular
estimate
of
him
were
favourable
or
not
he
found
that
the
count
was
decidedly
not
a
favourite
if
his
tenants
came
late
to
their
work
on
the
days
which
they
owed
to
him
as
lord
of
the
manor
they
were
set
on
the
wooden
horse
or
flogged
and
branded
in
the
manor-house
yard
one
or
two
cases
there
were
of
men
who
had
occupied
lands
which
encroached
on
the
lord's
domain
and
whose
houses
had
been
mysteriously
burnt
on
a
winter's
night
with
the
whole
family
inside
but
what
seemed
to
dwell
on
the
innkeeper's
mind
most--for
he
returned
to
the
subject
more
than
once--was
that
the
count
had
been
on
the
black
pilgrimage
and
had
brought
something
or
someone
back
with
him
you
will
naturally
inquire
as
mr
wraxall
did
what
the
black
pilgrimage
may
have
been
but
your
curiosity
on
the
point
must
remain
unsatisfied
for
the
time
being
just
as
his
did
the
landlord
was
evidently
unwilling
to
give
a
full
answer
or
indeed
any
answer
on
the
point
and
being
called
out
for
a
moment
trotted
out
with
obvious
alacrity
only
putting
his
head
in
at
the
door
a
few
minutes
afterwards
to
say
that
he
was
called
away
to
skara
and
should
not
be
back
till
evening
so
mr
wraxall
had
to
go
unsatisfied
to
his
day's
work
at
the
manor-house
the
papers
on
which
he
was
just
then
engaged
soon
put
his
thoughts
into
another
channel
for
he
had
to
occupy
himself
with
glancing
over
the
correspondence
between
sophia
albertina
in
stockholm
and
her
married
cousin
ulrica
leonora
at
rã¥bã¤ck
in
the
years
1705-10
the
letters
were
of
exceptional
interest
from
the
light
they
threw
upon
the
culture
of
that
period
in
sweden
as
anyone
can
testify
who
has
read
the
full
edition
of
them
in
the
publications
of
the
swedish
historical
manuscripts
commission
in
the
afternoon
he
had
done
with
these
and
after
returning
the
boxes
in
which
they
were
kept
to
their
places
on
the
shelf
he
proceeded
very
naturally
to
take
down
some
of
the
volumes
nearest
to
them
in
order
to
determine
which
of
them
had
best
be
his
principal
subject
of
investigation
next
day
the
shelf
he
had
hit
upon
was
occupied
mostly
by
a
collection
of
account-books
in
the
writing
of
the
first
count
magnus
but
one
among
them
was
not
an
account-book
but
a
book
of
alchemical
and
other
tracts
in
another
sixteenth-century
hand
not
being
very
familiar
with
alchemical
literature
mr
wraxall
spends
much
space
which
he
might
have
spared
in
setting
out
the
names
and
beginnings
of
the
various
treatises
the
book
of
the
phoenix
book
of
the
thirty
words
book
of
the
toad
book
of
miriam
turba
philosophorum
and
so
forth
and
then
he
announces
with
a
good
deal
of
circumstance
his
delight
at
finding
on
a
leaf
originally
left
blank
near
the
middle
of
the
book
some
writing
of
count
magnus
himself
headed
'liber
nigrae
peregrinationis'
it
is
true
that
only
a
few
lines
were
written
but
there
was
quite
enough
to
show
that
the
landlord
had
that
morning
been
referring
to
a
belief
at
least
as
old
as
the
time
of
count
magnus
and
probably
shared
by
him
this
is
the
english
of
what
was
written
'if
any
man
desires
to
obtain
a
long
life
if
he
would
obtain
a
faithful
messenger
and
see
the
blood
of
his
enemies
it
is
necessary
that
he
should
first
go
into
the
city
of
chorazin
and
there
salute
the
prince'
here
there
was
an
erasure
of
one
word
not
very
thoroughly
done
so
that
mr
wraxall
felt
pretty
sure
that
he
was
right
in
reading
it
as
aeris
'of
the
air'
but
there
was
no
more
of
the
text
copied
only
a
line
in
latin
quaere
reliqua
hujus
materiei
inter
secretiora
see
the
rest
of
this
matter
among
the
more
private
things
it
could
not
be
denied
that
this
threw
a
rather
lurid
light
upon
the
tastes
and
beliefs
of
the
count
but
to
mr
wraxall
separated
from
him
by
nearly
three
centuries
the
thought
that
he
might
have
added
to
his
general
forcefulness
alchemy
and
to
alchemy
something
like
magic
only
made
him
a
more
picturesque
figure
and
when
after
a
rather
prolonged
contemplation
of
his
picture
in
the
hall
mr
wraxall
set
out
on
his
homeward
way
his
mind
was
full
of
the
thought
of
count
magnus
he
had
no
eyes
for
his
surroundings
no
perception
of
the
evening
scents
of
the
woods
or
the
evening
light
on
the
lake
and
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
pulled
up
short
he
was
astonished
to
find
himself
already
at
the
gate
of
the
churchyard
and
within
a
few
minutes
of
his
dinner
his
eyes
fell
on
the
mausoleum
'ah'
he
said
'count
magnus
there
you
are
i
should
dearly
like
to
see
you'
'like
many
solitary
men'
he
writes
'i
have
a
habit
of
talking
to
myself
aloud
and
unlike
some
of
the
greek
and
latin
particles
i
do
not
expect
an
answer
certainly
and
perhaps
fortunately
in
this
case
there
was
neither
voice
nor
any
that
regarded
only
the
woman
who
i
suppose
was
cleaning
up
the
church
dropped
some
metallic
object
on
the
floor
whose
clang
startled
me
count
magnus
i
think
sleeps
sound
enough'
that
same
evening
the
landlord
of
the
inn
who
had
heard
mr
wraxall
say
that
he
wished
to
see
the
clerk
or
deacon
as
he
would
be
called
in
sweden
of
the
parish
introduced
him
to
that
official
in
the
inn
parlour
a
visit
to
the
de
la
gardie
tomb-house
was
soon
arranged
for
the
next
day
and
a
little
general
conversation
ensued
mr
wraxall
remembering
that
one
function
of
scandinavian
deacons
is
to
teach
candidates
for
confirmation
thought
he
would
refresh
his
own
memory
on
a
biblical
point
'can
you
tell
me'
he
said
'anything
about
chorazin'
the
deacon
seemed
startled
but
readily
reminded
him
how
that
village
had
once
been
denounced
'to
be
sure'
said
mr
wraxall
'it
is
i
suppose
quite
a
ruin
now'
'so
i
expect'
replied
the
deacon
'i
have
heard
some
of
our
old
priests
say
that
antichrist
is
to
be
born
there
and
there
are
tales--'
'ah
what
tales
are
those'
mr
wraxall
put
in
'tales
i
was
going
to
say
which
i
have
forgotten'
said
the
deacon
and
soon
after
that
he
said
good
night
the
landlord
was
now
alone
and
at
mr
wraxall's
mercy
and
that
inquirer
was
not
inclined
to
spare
him
'herr
nielsen'
he
said
'i
have
found
out
something
about
the
black
pilgrimage
you
may
as
well
tell
me
what
you
know
what
did
the
count
bring
back
with
him'
swedes
are
habitually
slow
perhaps
in
answering
or
perhaps
the
landlord
was
an
exception
i
am
not
sure
but
mr
wraxall
notes
that
the
landlord
spent
at
least
one
minute
in
looking
at
him
before
he
said
anything
at
all
then
he
came
close
up
to
his
guest
and
with
a
good
deal
of
effort
he
spoke
'mr
wraxall
i
can
tell
you
this
one
little
tale
and
no
more--not
any
more
you
must
not
ask
anything
when
i
have
done
in
my
grandfather's
time--that
is
ninety-two
years
ago--there
were
two
men
who
said
the
count
is
dead
we
do
not
care
for
him
we
will
go
tonight
and
have
a
free
hunt
in
his
wood--the
long
wood
on
the
hill
that
you
have
seen
behind
rã¥bã¤ck
well
those
that
heard
them
say
this
they
said
no
do
not
go
we
are
sure
you
will
meet
with
persons
walking
who
should
not
be
walking
they
should
be
resting
not
walking
these
men
laughed
there
were
no
forestmen
to
keep
the
wood
because
no
one
wished
to
live
there
the
family
were
not
here
at
the
house
these
men
could
do
what
they
wished
'very
well
they
go
to
the
wood
that
night
my
grandfather
was
sitting
here
in
this
room
it
was
the
summer
and
a
light
night
with
the
window
open
he
could
see
out
to
the
wood
and
hear
'so
he
sat
there
and
two
or
three
men
with
him
and
they
listened
at
first
they
hear
nothing
at
all
then
they
hear
someone--you
know
how
far
away
it
is--they
hear
someone
scream
just
as
if
the
most
inside
part
of
his
soul
was
twisted
out
of
him
all
of
them
in
the
room
caught
hold
of
each
other
and
they
sat
so
for
three-quarters
of
an
hour
then
they
hear
someone
else
only
about
three
hundred
ells
off
they
hear
him
laugh
out
loud
it
was
not
one
of
those
two
men
that
laughed
and
indeed
they
have
all
of
them
said
that
it
was
not
any
man
at
all
after
that
they
hear
a
great
door
shut
'then
when
it
was
just
light
with
the
sun
they
all
went
to
the
priest
they
said
to
him
'father
put
on
your
gown
and
your
ruff
and
come
to
bury
these
men
anders
bjornsen
and
hans
thorbjorn
'you
understand
that
they
were
sure
these
men
were
dead
so
they
went
to
the
wood--my
grandfather
never
forgot
this
he
said
they
were
all
like
so
many
dead
men
themselves
the
priest
too
he
was
in
a
white
fear
he
said
when
they
came
to
him
'i
heard
one
cry
in
the
night
and
i
heard
one
laugh
afterwards
if
i
cannot
forget
that
i
shall
not
be
able
to
sleep
again
'so
they
went
to
the
wood
and
they
found
these
men
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
hans
thorbjorn
was
standing
with
his
back
against
a
tree
and
all
the
time
he
was
pushing
with
his
hands--pushing
something
away
from
him
which
was
not
there
so
he
was
not
dead
and
they
led
him
away
and
took
him
to
the
house
at
nykjoping
and
he
died
before
the
winter
but
he
went
on
pushing
with
his
hands
also
anders
bjornsen
was
there
but
he
was
dead
and
i
tell
you
this
about
anders
bjornsen
that
he
was
once
a
beautiful
man
but
now
his
face
was
not
there
because
the
flesh
of
it
was
sucked
away
off
the
bones
you
understand
that
my
grandfather
did
not
forget
that
and
they
laid
him
on
the
bier
which
they
brought
and
they
put
a
cloth
over
his
head
and
the
priest
walked
before
and
they
began
to
sing
the
psalm
for
the
dead
as
well
as
they
could
so
as
they
were
singing
the
end
of
the
first
verse
one
fell
down
who
was
carrying
the
head
of
the
bier
and
the
others
looked
back
and
they
saw
that
the
cloth
had
fallen
off
and
the
eyes
of
anders
bjornsen
were
looking
up
because
there
was
nothing
to
close
over
them
and
this
they
could
not
bear
therefore
the
priest
laid
the
cloth
upon
him
and
sent
for
a
spade
and
they
buried
him
in
that
place'
the
next
day
mr
wraxall
records
that
the
deacon
called
for
him
soon
after
his
breakfast
and
took
him
to
the
church
and
mausoleum
he
noticed
that
the
key
of
the
latter
was
hung
on
a
nail
just
by
the
pulpit
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
as
the
church
door
seemed
to
be
left
unlocked
as
a
rule
it
would
not
be
difficult
for
him
to
pay
a
second
and
more
private
visit
to
the
monuments
if
there
proved
to
be
more
of
interest
among
them
than
could
be
digested
at
first
the
building
when
he
entered
it
he
found
not
unimposing
the
monuments
mostly
large
erections
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
were
dignified
if
luxuriant
and
the
epitaphs
and
heraldry
were
copious
the
central
space
of
the
domed
room
was
occupied
by
three
copper
sarcophagi
covered
with
finely-engraved
ornament
two
of
them
had
as
is
commonly
the
case
in
denmark
and
sweden
a
large
metal
crucifix
on
the
lid
the
third
that
of
count
magnus
as
it
appeared
had
instead
of
that
a
full-length
effigy
engraved
upon
it
and
round
the
edge
were
several
bands
of
similar
ornament
representing
various
scenes
one
was
a
battle
with
cannon
belching
out
smoke
and
walled
towns
and
troops
of
pikemen
another
showed
an
execution
in
a
third
among
trees
was
a
man
running
at
full
speed
with
flying
hair
and
outstretched
hands
after
him
followed
a
strange
form
it
would
be
hard
to
say
whether
the
artist
had
intended
it
for
a
man
and
was
unable
to
give
the
requisite
similitude
or
whether
it
was
intentionally
made
as
monstrous
as
it
looked
in
view
of
the
skill
with
which
the
rest
of
the
drawing
was
done
mr
wraxall
felt
inclined
to
adopt
the
latter
idea
the
figure
was
unduly
short
and
was
for
the
most
part
muffled
in
a
hooded
garment
which
swept
the
ground
the
only
part
of
the
form
which
projected
from
that
shelter
was
not
shaped
like
any
hand
or
arm
mr
wraxall
compares
it
to
the
tentacle
of
a
devil-fish
and
continues
'on
seeing
this
i
said
to
myself
this
then
which
is
evidently
an
allegorical
representation
of
some
kind--a
fiend
pursuing
a
hunted
soul--may
be
the
origin
of
the
story
of
count
magnus
and
his
mysterious
companion
let
us
see
how
the
huntsman
is
pictured
doubtless
it
will
be
a
demon
blowing
his
horn'
but
as
it
turned
out
there
was
no
such
sensational
figure
only
the
semblance
of
a
cloaked
man
on
a
hillock
who
stood
leaning
on
a
stick
and
watching
the
hunt
with
an
interest
which
the
engraver
had
tried
to
express
in
his
attitude
mr
wraxall
noted
the
finely-worked
and
massive
steel
padlocks--three
in
number--which
secured
the
sarcophagus
one
of
them
he
saw
was
detached
and
lay
on
the
pavement
and
then
unwilling
to
delay
the
deacon
longer
or
to
waste
his
own
working-time
he
made
his
way
onward
to
the
manor-house
'it
is
curious'
he
notes
'how
on
retracing
a
familiar
path
one's
thoughts
engross
one
to
the
absolute
exclusion
of
surrounding
objects
tonight
for
the
second
time
i
had
entirely
failed
to
notice
where
i
was
going
i
had
planned
a
private
visit
to
the
tomb-house
to
copy
the
epitaphs
when
i
suddenly
as
it
were
awoke
to
consciousness
and
found
myself
as
before
turning
in
at
the
churchyard
gate
and
i
believe
singing
or
chanting
some
such
words
as
are
you
awake
count
magnus
are
you
asleep
count
magnus
and
then
something
more
which
i
have
failed
to
recollect
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
must
have
been
behaving
in
this
nonsensical
way
for
some
time'
he
found
the
key
of
the
mausoleum
where
he
had
expected
to
find
it
and
copied
the
greater
part
of
what
he
wanted
in
fact
he
stayed
until
the
light
began
to
fail
him
'i
must
have
been
wrong'
he
writes
'in
saying
that
one
of
the
padlocks
of
my
counts
sarcophagus
was
unfastened
i
see
tonight
that
two
are
loose
i
picked
both
up
and
laid
them
carefully
on
the
window-ledge
after
trying
unsuccessfully
to
close
them
the
remaining
one
is
still
firm
and
though
i
take
it
to
be
a
spring
lock
i
cannot
guess
how
it
is
opened
had
i
succeeded
in
undoing
it
i
am
almost
afraid
i
should
have
taken
the
liberty
of
opening
the
sarcophagus
it
is
strange
the
interest
i
feel
in
the
personality
of
this
i
fear
somewhat
ferocious
and
grim
old
noble'
the
day
following
was
as
it
turned
out
the
last
of
mr
wraxall's
stay
at
rã¥bã¤ck
he
received
letters
connected
with
certain
investments
which
made
it
desirable
that
he
should
return
to
england
his
work
among
the
papers
was
practically
done
and
travelling
was
slow
he
decided
therefore
to
make
his
farewells
put
some
finishing
touches
to
his
notes
and
be
off
these
finishing
touches
and
farewells
as
it
turned
out
took
more
time
than
he
had
expected
the
hospitable
family
insisted
on
his
staying
to
dine
with
them--they
dined
at
three--and
it
was
verging
on
half
past
six
before
he
was
outside
the
iron
gates
of
rã¥bã¤ck
he
dwelt
on
every
step
of
his
walk
by
the
lake
determined
to
saturate
himself
now
that
he
trod
it
for
the
last
time
in
the
sentiment
of
the
place
and
hour
and
when
he
reached
the
summit
of
the
churchyard
knoll
he
lingered
for
many
minutes
gazing
at
the
limitless
prospect
of
woods
near
and
distant
all
dark
beneath
a
sky
of
liquid
green
when
at
last
he
turned
to
go
the
thought
struck
him
that
surely
he
must
bid
farewell
to
count
magnus
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
de
la
gardies
the
church
was
but
twenty
yards
away
and
he
knew
where
the
key
of
the
mausoleum
hung
it
was
not
long
before
he
was
standing
over
the
great
copper
coffin
and
as
usual
talking
to
himself
aloud
'you
may
have
been
a
bit
of
a
rascal
in
your
time
magnus'
he
was
saying
'but
for
all
that
i
should
like
to
see
you
or
rather--'
'just
at
that
instant'
he
says
'i
felt
a
blow
on
my
foot
hastily
enough
i
drew
it
back
and
something
fell
on
the
pavement
with
a
clash
it
was
the
third
the
last
of
the
three
padlocks
which
had
fastened
the
sarcophagus
i
stooped
to
pick
it
up
and--heaven
is
my
witness
that
i
am
writing
only
the
bare
truth--before
i
had
raised
myself
there
was
a
sound
of
metal
hinges
creaking
and
i
distinctly
saw
the
lid
shifting
upwards
i
may
have
behaved
like
a
coward
but
i
could
not
for
my
life
stay
for
one
moment
i
was
outside
that
dreadful
building
in
less
time
than
i
can
write--almost
as
quickly
as
i
could
have
said--the
words
and
what
frightens
me
yet
more
i
could
not
turn
the
key
in
the
lock
as
i
sit
here
in
my
room
noting
these
facts
i
ask
myself
it
was
not
twenty
minutes
ago
whether
that
noise
of
creaking
metal
continued
and
i
cannot
tell
whether
it
did
or
not
i
only
know
that
there
was
something
more
than
i
have
written
that
alarmed
me
but
whether
it
was
sound
or
sight
i
am
not
able
to
remember
what
is
this
that
i
have
done'





poor
mr
wraxall
he
set
out
on
his
journey
to
england
on
the
next
day
as
he
had
planned
and
he
reached
england
in
safety
and
yet
as
i
gather
from
his
changed
hand
and
inconsequent
jottings
a
broken
man
one
of
the
several
small
note-books
that
have
come
to
me
with
his
papers
gives
not
a
key
to
but
a
kind
of
inkling
of
his
experiences
much
of
his
journey
was
made
by
canal-boat
and
i
find
not
less
than
six
painful
attempts
to
enumerate
and
describe
his
fellow-passengers
the
entries
are
of
this
kind
24
pastor
of
village
in
skane
usual
black
coat
and
soft
black
hat
25
commercial
traveller
from
stockholm
going
to
trollhã¤ttan
black
cloak
brown
hat
26
man
in
long
black
cloak
broad-leafed
hat
very
old-fashioned
this
entry
is
lined
out
and
a
note
added
'perhaps
identical
with
no
13
have
not
yet
seen
his
face'
on
referring
to
no
13
i
find
that
he
is
a
roman
priest
in
a
cassock
the
net
result
of
the
reckoning
is
always
the
same
twenty-eight
people
appear
in
the
enumeration
one
being
always
a
man
in
a
long
black
cloak
and
broad
hat
and
another
a
'short
figure
in
dark
cloak
and
hood'
on
the
other
hand
it
is
always
noted
that
only
twenty-six
passengers
appear
at
meals
and
that
the
man
in
the
cloak
is
perhaps
absent
and
the
short
figure
is
certainly
absent
on
reaching
england
it
appears
that
mr
wraxall
landed
at
harwich
and
that
he
resolved
at
once
to
put
himself
out
of
the
reach
of
some
person
or
persons
whom
he
never
specifies
but
whom
he
had
evidently
come
to
regard
as
his
pursuers
accordingly
he
took
a
vehicle--it
was
a
closed
fly--not
trusting
the
railway
and
drove
across
country
to
the
village
of
belchamp
st
paul
it
was
about
nine
o'clock
on
a
moonlight
august
night
when
he
neared
the
place
he
was
sitting
forward
and
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
fields
and
thickets--there
was
little
else
to
be
seen--racing
past
him
suddenly
he
came
to
a
cross-road
at
the
corner
two
figures
were
standing
motionless
both
were
in
dark
cloaks
the
taller
one
wore
a
hat
the
shorter
a
hood
he
had
no
time
to
see
their
faces
nor
did
they
make
any
motion
that
he
could
discern
yet
the
horse
shied
violently
and
broke
into
a
gallop
and
mr
wraxall
sank
back
into
his
seat
in
something
like
desperation
he
had
seen
them
before
arrived
at
belchamp
st
paul
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
a
decent
furnished
lodging
and
for
the
next
twenty-four
hours
he
lived
comparatively
speaking
in
peace
his
last
notes
were
written
on
this
day
they
are
too
disjointed
and
ejaculatory
to
be
given
here
in
full
but
the
substance
of
them
is
clear
enough
he
is
expecting
a
visit
from
his
pursuers--how
or
when
he
knows
not--and
his
constant
cry
is
'what
has
he
done'
and
'is
there
no
hope'
doctors
he
knows
would
call
him
mad
policemen
would
laugh
at
him
the
parson
is
away
what
can
he
do
but
lock
his
door
and
cry
to
god
people
still
remember
last
year
at
belchamp
st
paul
how
a
strange
gentleman
came
one
evening
in
august
years
back
and
how
the
next
morning
but
one
he
was
found
dead
and
there
was
an
inquest
and
the
jury
that
viewed
the
body
fainted
seven
of
'em
did
and
none
of
'em
wouldn't
speak
to
what
they
see
and
the
verdict
was
visitation
of
god
and
how
the
people
as
kep'
the
'ouse
moved
out
that
same
week
and
went
away
from
that
part
but
they
do
not
i
think
know
that
any
glimmer
of
light
has
ever
been
thrown
or
could
be
thrown
on
the
mystery
it
so
happened
that
last
year
the
little
house
came
into
my
hands
as
part
of
a
legacy
it
had
stood
empty
since
1863
and
there
seemed
no
prospect
of
letting
it
so
i
had
it
pulled
down
and
the
papers
of
which
i
have
given
you
an
abstract
were
found
in
a
forgotten
cupboard
under
the
window
in
the
best
bedroom
'oh
whistle
and
i'll
come
to
you
my
lad'
'i
suppose
you
will
be
getting
away
pretty
soon
now
full
term
is
over
professor'
said
a
person
not
in
the
story
to
the
professor
of
ontography
soon
after
they
had
sat
down
next
to
each
other
at
a
feast
in
the
hospitable
hall
of
st
james's
college
the
professor
was
young
neat
and
precise
in
speech
'yes'
he
said
'my
friends
have
been
making
me
take
up
golf
this
term
and
i
mean
to
go
to
the
east
coast--in
point
of
fact
to
burnstow--i
dare
say
you
know
it
for
a
week
or
ten
days
to
improve
my
game
i
hope
to
get
off
tomorrow'
'oh
parkins'
said
his
neighbour
on
the
other
side
'if
you
are
going
to
burnstow
i
wish
you
would
look
at
the
site
of
the
templars'
preceptory
and
let
me
know
if
you
think
it
would
be
any
good
to
have
a
dig
there
in
the
summer'
it
was
as
you
might
suppose
a
person
of
antiquarian
pursuits
who
said
this
but
since
he
merely
appears
in
this
prologue
there
is
no
need
to
give
his
entitlements
'certainly'
said
parkins
the
professor
'if
you
will
describe
to
me
whereabouts
the
site
is
i
will
do
my
best
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
lie
of
the
land
when
i
get
back
or
i
could
write
to
you
about
it
if
you
would
tell
me
where
you
are
likely
to
be'
'don't
trouble
to
do
that
thanks
it's
only
that
i'm
thinking
of
taking
my
family
in
that
direction
in
the
long
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
as
very
few
of
the
english
preceptories
have
ever
been
properly
planned
i
might
have
an
opportunity
of
doing
something
useful
on
off-days'
the
professor
rather
sniffed
at
the
idea
that
planning
out
a
preceptory
could
be
described
as
useful
his
neighbour
continued
'the
site--i
doubt
if
there
is
anything
showing
above
ground--must
be
down
quite
close
to
the
beach
now
the
sea
has
encroached
tremendously
as
you
know
all
along
that
bit
of
coast
i
should
think
from
the
map
that
it
must
be
about
three-quarters
of
a
mile
from
the
globe
inn
at
the
north
end
of
the
town
where
are
you
going
to
stay'
'well
at
the
globe
inn
as
a
matter
of
fact'
said
parkins
'i
have
engaged
a
room
there
i
couldn't
get
in
anywhere
else
most
of
the
lodging-houses
are
shut
up
in
winter
it
seems
and
as
it
is
they
tell
me
that
the
only
room
of
any
size
i
can
have
is
really
a
double-bedded
one
and
that
they
haven't
a
corner
in
which
to
store
the
other
bed
and
so
on
but
i
must
have
a
fairly
large
room
for
i
am
taking
some
books
down
and
mean
to
do
a
bit
of
work
and
though
i
don't
quite
fancy
having
an
empty
bed--not
to
speak
of
two--in
what
i
may
call
for
the
time
being
my
study
i
suppose
i
can
manage
to
rough
it
for
the
short
time
i
shall
be
there'
'do
you
call
having
an
extra
bed
in
your
room
roughing
it
parkins'
said
a
bluff
person
opposite
'look
here
i
shall
come
down
and
occupy
it
for
a
bit
it'll
be
company
for
you'
the
professor
quivered
but
managed
to
laugh
in
a
courteous
manner
'by
all
means
rogers
there's
nothing
i
should
like
better
but
i'm
afraid
you
would
find
it
rather
dull
you
don't
play
golf
do
you'
'no
thank
heaven'
said
rude
mr
rogers
'well
you
see
when
i'm
not
writing
i
shall
most
likely
be
out
on
the
links
and
that
as
i
say
would
be
rather
dull
for
you
i'm
afraid'
'oh
i
don't
know
there's
certain
to
be
somebody
i
know
in
the
place
but
of
course
if
you
don't
want
me
speak
the
word
parkins
i
shan't
be
offended
truth
as
you
always
tell
us
is
never
offensive'
parkins
was
indeed
scrupulously
polite
and
strictly
truthful
it
is
to
be
feared
that
mr
rogers
sometimes
practised
upon
his
knowledge
of
these
characteristics
in
parkins's
breast
there
was
a
conflict
now
raging
which
for
a
moment
or
two
did
not
allow
him
to
answer
that
interval
being
over
he
said
'well
if
you
want
the
exact
truth
rogers
i
was
considering
whether
the
room
i
speak
of
would
really
be
large
enough
to
accommodate
us
both
comfortably
and
also
whether
mind
i
shouldn't
have
said
this
if
you
hadn't
pressed
me
you
would
not
constitute
something
in
the
nature
of
a
hindrance
to
my
work'
rogers
laughed
loudly
'well
done
parkins'
he
said
'it's
all
right
i
promise
not
to
interrupt
your
work
don't
you
disturb
yourself
about
that
no
i
won't
come
if
you
don't
want
me
but
i
thought
i
should
do
so
nicely
to
keep
the
ghosts
off'
here
he
might
have
been
seen
to
wink
and
to
nudge
his
next
neighbour
parkins
might
also
have
been
seen
to
become
pink
'i
beg
pardon
parkins'
rogers
continued
'i
oughtn't
to
have
said
that
i
forgot
you
didn't
like
levity
on
these
topics'
'well'
parkins
said
'as
you
have
mentioned
the
matter
i
freely
own
that
i
do
not
like
careless
talk
about
what
you
call
ghosts
a
man
in
my
position'
he
went
on
raising
his
voice
a
little
'cannot
i
find
be
too
careful
about
appearing
to
sanction
the
current
beliefs
on
such
subjects
as
you
know
rogers
or
as
you
ought
to
know
for
i
think
i
have
never
concealed
my
views--'
'no
you
certainly
have
not
old
man'
put
in
rogers
sotto
voce
'--i
hold
that
any
semblance
any
appearance
of
concession
to
the
view
that
such
things
might
exist
is
equivalent
to
a
renunciation
of
all
that
i
hold
most
sacred
but
i'm
afraid
i
have
not
succeeded
in
securing
your
attention'
'your
undivided
attention
was
what
dr
blimber
actually
said'4
rogers
interrupted
with
every
appearance
of
an
earnest
desire
for
accuracy
'but
i
beg
your
pardon
parkins
i'm
stopping
you'

mr
rogers
was

chapter
xii
'no
not
at
all'
said
parkins
'i
don't
remember
blimber
perhaps
he
was
before
my
time
but
i
needn't
go
on
i'm
sure
you
know
what
i
mean'
'yes
yes'
said
rogers
rather
hastily--'just
so
we'll
go
into
it
fully
at
burnstow
or
somewhere'
in
repeating
the
above
dialogue
i
have
tried
to
give
the
impression
which
it
made
on
me
that
parkins
was
something
of
an
old
woman--rather
henlike
perhaps
in
his
little
ways
totally
destitute
alas
of
the
sense
of
humour
but
at
the
same
time
dauntless
and
sincere
in
his
convictions
and
a
man
deserving
of
the
greatest
respect
whether
or
not
the
reader
has
gathered
so
much
that
was
the
character
which
parkins
had





on
the
following
day
parkins
did
as
he
had
hoped
succeed
in
getting
away
from
his
college
and
in
arriving
at
burnstow
he
was
made
welcome
at
the
globe
inn
was
safely
installed
in
the
large
double-bedded
room
of
which
we
have
heard
and
was
able
before
retiring
to
rest
to
arrange
his
materials
for
work
in
apple-pie
order
upon
a
commodious
table
which
occupied
the
outer
end
of
the
room
and
was
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
windows
looking
out
seaward
that
is
to
say
the
central
window
looked
straight
out
to
sea
and
those
on
the
left
and
right
commanded
prospects
along
the
shore
to
the
north
and
south
respectively
on
the
south
you
saw
the
village
of
burnstow
on
the
north
no
houses
were
to
be
seen
but
only
the
beach
and
the
low
cliff
backing
it
immediately
in
front
was
a
strip--not
considerable--of
rough
grass
dotted
with
old
anchors
capstans
and
so
forth
then
a
broad
path
then
the
beach
whatever
may
have
been
the
original
distance
between
the
globe
inn
and
the
sea
not
more
than
sixty
yards
now
separated
them
the
rest
of
the
population
of
the
inn
was
of
course
a
golfing
one
and
included
few
elements
that
call
for
a
special
description
the
most
conspicuous
figure
was
perhaps
that
of
an
ancien
militaire
secretary
of
a
london
club
and
possessed
of
a
voice
of
incredible
strength
and
of
views
of
a
pronouncedly
protestant
type
these
were
apt
to
find
utterance
after
his
attendance
upon
the
ministrations
of
the
vicar
an
estimable
man
with
inclinations
towards
a
picturesque
ritual
which
he
gallantly
kept
down
as
far
as
he
could
out
of
deference
to
east
anglian
tradition
professor
parkins
one
of
whose
principal
characteristics
was
pluck
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
day
following
his
arrival
at
burnstow
in
what
he
had
called
improving
his
game
in
company
with
this
colonel
wilson
and
during
the
afternoon--whether
the
process
of
improvement
were
to
blame
or
not
i
am
not
sure--the
colonel's
demeanour
assumed
a
colouring
so
lurid
that
even
parkins
jibbed
at
the
thought
of
walking
home
with
him
from
the
links
he
determined
after
a
short
and
furtive
look
at
that
bristling
moustache
and
those
incarnadined
features
that
it
would
be
wiser
to
allow
the
influences
of
tea
and
tobacco
to
do
what
they
could
with
the
colonel
before
the
dinner-hour
should
render
a
meeting
inevitable
'i
might
walk
home
tonight
along
the
beach'
he
reflected--'yes
and
take
a
look--there
will
be
light
enough
for
that--at
the
ruins
of
which
disney
was
talking
i
don't
exactly
know
where
they
are
by
the
way
but
i
expect
i
can
hardly
help
stumbling
on
them'
this
he
accomplished
i
may
say
in
the
most
literal
sense
for
in
picking
his
way
from
the
links
to
the
shingle
beach
his
foot
caught
partly
in
a
gorse-root
and
partly
in
a
biggish
stone
and
over
he
went
when
he
got
up
and
surveyed
his
surroundings
he
found
himself
in
a
patch
of
somewhat
broken
ground
covered
with
small
depressions
and
mounds
these
latter
when
he
came
to
examine
them
proved
to
be
simply
masses
of
flints
embedded
in
mortar
and
grown
over
with
turf
he
must
he
quite
rightly
concluded
be
on
the
site
of
the
preceptory
he
had
promised
to
look
at
it
seemed
not
unlikely
to
reward
the
spade
of
the
explorer
enough
of
the
foundations
was
probably
left
at
no
great
depth
to
throw
a
good
deal
of
light
on
the
general
plan
he
remembered
vaguely
that
the
templars
to
whom
this
site
had
belonged
were
in
the
habit
of
building
round
churches
and
he
thought
a
particular
series
of
the
humps
or
mounds
near
him
did
appear
to
be
arranged
in
something
of
a
circular
form
few
people
can
resist
the
temptation
to
try
a
little
amateur
research
in
a
department
quite
outside
their
own
if
only
for
the
satisfaction
of
showing
how
successful
they
would
have
been
had
they
only
taken
it
up
seriously
our
professor
however
if
he
felt
something
of
this
mean
desire
was
also
truly
anxious
to
oblige
mr
disney
so
he
paced
with
care
the
circular
area
he
had
noticed
and
wrote
down
its
rough
dimensions
in
his
pocket-book
then
he
proceeded
to
examine
an
oblong
eminence
which
lay
east
of
the
centre
of
the
circle
and
seemed
to
his
thinking
likely
to
be
the
base
of
a
platform
or
altar
at
one
end
of
it
the
northern
a
patch
of
the
turf
was
gone--removed
by
some
boy
or
other
creature
ferae
naturae
it
might
he
thought
be
as
well
to
probe
the
soil
here
for
evidences
of
masonry
and
he
took
out
his
knife
and
began
scraping
away
the
earth
and
now
followed
another
little
discovery
a
portion
of
soil
fell
inward
as
he
scraped
and
disclosed
a
small
cavity
he
lighted
one
match
after
another
to
help
him
to
see
of
what
nature
the
hole
was
but
the
wind
was
too
strong
for
them
all
by
tapping
and
scratching
the
sides
with
his
knife
however
he
was
able
to
make
out
that
it
must
be
an
artificial
hole
in
masonry
it
was
rectangular
and
the
sides
top
and
bottom
if
not
actually
plastered
were
smooth
and
regular
of
course
it
was
empty
no
as
he
withdrew
the
knife
he
heard
a
metallic
clink
and
when
he
introduced
his
hand
it
met
with
a
cylindrical
object
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
hole
naturally
enough
he
picked
it
up
and
when
he
brought
it
into
the
light
now
fast
fading
he
could
see
that
it
too
was
of
man's
making--a
metal
tube
about
four
inches
long
and
evidently
of
some
considerable
age
by
the
time
parkins
had
made
sure
that
there
was
nothing
else
in
this
odd
receptacle
it
was
too
late
and
too
dark
for
him
to
think
of
undertaking
any
further
search
what
he
had
done
had
proved
so
unexpectedly
interesting
that
he
determined
to
sacrifice
a
little
more
of
the
daylight
on
the
morrow
to
archaeology
the
object
which
he
now
had
safe
in
his
pocket
was
bound
to
be
of
some
slight
value
at
least
he
felt
sure
bleak
and
solemn
was
the
view
on
which
he
took
a
last
look
before
starting
homeward
a
faint
yellow
light
in
the
west
showed
the
links
on
which
a
few
figures
moving
towards
the
club-house
were
still
visible
the
squat
martello
tower
the
lights
of
aldsey
village
the
pale
ribbon
of
sands
intersected
at
intervals
by
black
wooden
groynings
the
dim
and
murmuring
sea
the
wind
was
bitter
from
the
north
but
was
at
his
back
when
he
set
out
for
the
globe
he
quickly
rattled
and
clashed
through
the
shingle
and
gained
the
sand
upon
which
but
for
the
groynings
which
had
to
be
got
over
every
few
yards
the
going
was
both
good
and
quiet
one
last
look
behind
to
measure
the
distance
he
had
made
since
leaving
the
ruined
templars'
church
showed
him
a
prospect
of
company
on
his
walk
in
the
shape
of
a
rather
indistinct
personage
who
seemed
to
be
making
great
efforts
to
catch
up
with
him
but
made
little
if
any
progress
i
mean
that
there
was
an
appearance
of
running
about
his
movements
but
that
the
distance
between
him
and
parkins
did
not
seem
materially
to
lessen
so
at
least
parkins
thought
and
decided
that
he
almost
certainly
did
not
know
him
and
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
wait
until
he
came
up
for
all
that
company
he
began
to
think
would
really
be
very
welcome
on
that
lonely
shore
if
only
you
could
choose
your
companion
in
his
unenlightened
days
he
had
read
of
meetings
in
such
places
which
even
now
would
hardly
bear
thinking
of
he
went
on
thinking
of
them
however
until
he
reached
home
and
particularly
of
one
which
catches
most
people's
fancy
at
some
time
of
their
childhood
'now
i
saw
in
my
dream
that
christian
had
gone
but
a
very
little
way
when
he
saw
a
foul
fiend
coming
over
the
field
to
meet
him'
'what
should
i
do
now'
he
thought
'if
i
looked
back
and
caught
sight
of
a
black
figure
sharply
defined
against
the
yellow
sky
and
saw
that
it
had
horns
and
wings
i
wonder
whether
i
should
stand
or
run
for
it
luckily
the
gentleman
behind
is
not
of
that
kind
and
he
seems
to
be
about
as
far
off
now
as
when
i
saw
him
first
well
at
this
rate
he
won't
get
his
dinner
as
soon
as
i
shall
and
dear
me
it's
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
the
time
now
i
must
run'
parkins
had
in
fact
very
little
time
for
dressing
when
he
met
the
colonel
at
dinner
peace--or
as
much
of
her
as
that
gentleman
could
manage--reigned
once
more
in
the
military
bosom
nor
was
she
put
to
flight
in
the
hours
of
bridge
that
followed
dinner
for
parkins
was
a
more
than
respectable
player
when
therefore
he
retired
towards
twelve
o'clock
he
felt
that
he
had
spent
his
evening
in
quite
a
satisfactory
way
and
that
even
for
so
long
as
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
life
at
the
globe
would
be
supportable
under
similar
conditions--'especially'
thought
he
'if
i
go
on
improving
my
game'
as
he
went
along
the
passages
he
met
the
boots
of
the
globe
who
stopped
and
said
'beg
your
pardon
sir
but
as
i
was
abrushing
your
coat
just
now
there
was
something
fell
out
of
the
pocket
i
put
it
on
your
chest
of
drawers
sir
in
your
room
sir--a
piece
of
a
pipe
or
somethink
of
that
sir
thank
you
sir
you'll
find
it
on
your
chest
of
drawers
sir--yes
sir
good
night
sir'
the
speech
served
to
remind
parkins
of
his
little
discovery
of
that
afternoon
it
was
with
some
considerable
curiosity
that
he
turned
it
over
by
the
light
of
his
candles
it
was
of
bronze
he
now
saw
and
was
shaped
very
much
after
the
manner
of
the
modern
dog-whistle
in
fact
it
was--yes
certainly
it
was--actually
no
more
nor
less
than
a
whistle
he
put
it
to
his
lips
but
it
was
quite
full
of
a
fine
caked-up
sand
or
earth
which
would
not
yield
to
knocking
but
must
be
loosened
with
a
knife
tidy
as
ever
in
his
habits
parkins
cleared
out
the
earth
on
to
a
piece
of
paper
and
took
the
latter
to
the
window
to
empty
it
out
the
night
was
clear
and
bright
as
he
saw
when
he
had
opened
the
casement
and
he
stopped
for
an
instant
to
look
at
the
sea
and
note
a
belated
wanderer
stationed
on
the
shore
in
front
of
the
inn
then
he
shut
the
window
a
little
surprised
at
the
late
hours
people
kept
at
burnstow
and
took
his
whistle
to
the
light
again
why
surely
there
were
marks
on
it
and
not
merely
marks
but
letters
a
very
little
rubbing
rendered
the
deeply-cut
inscription
quite
legible
but
the
professor
had
to
confess
after
some
earnest
thought
that
the
meaning
of
it
was
as
obscure
to
him
as
the
writing
on
the
wall
to
belshazzar
there
were
legends
both
on
the
front
and
on
the
back
of
the
whistle
the
one
read
thus
fla
fur
bis
fle
the
other
quis
est
iste
qui
venit
'i
ought
to
be
able
to
make
it
out'
he
thought
'but
i
suppose
i
am
a
little
rusty
in
my
latin
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
don't
believe
i
even
know
the
word
for
a
whistle
the
long
one
does
seem
simple
enough
it
ought
to
mean
who
is
this
who
is
coming
well
the
best
way
to
find
out
is
evidently
to
whistle
for
him'
he
blew
tentatively
and
stopped
suddenly
startled
and
yet
pleased
at
the
note
he
had
elicited
it
had
a
quality
of
infinite
distance
in
it
and
soft
as
it
was
he
somehow
felt
it
must
be
audible
for
miles
round
it
was
a
sound
too
that
seemed
to
have
the
power
which
many
scents
possess
of
forming
pictures
in
the
brain
he
saw
quite
clearly
for
a
moment
a
vision
of
a
wide
dark
expanse
at
night
with
a
fresh
wind
blowing
and
in
the
midst
a
lonely
figure--how
employed
he
could
not
tell
perhaps
he
would
have
seen
more
had
not
the
picture
been
broken
by
the
sudden
surge
of
a
gust
of
wind
against
his
casement
so
sudden
that
it
made
him
look
up
just
in
time
to
see
the
white
glint
of
a
seabird's
wing
somewhere
outside
the
dark
panes
the
sound
of
the
whistle
had
so
fascinated
him
that
he
could
not
help
trying
it
once
more
this
time
more
boldly
the
note
was
little
if
at
all
louder
than
before
and
repetition
broke
the
illusion--no
picture
followed
as
he
had
half
hoped
it
might
but
what
is
this
goodness
what
force
the
wind
can
get
up
in
a
few
minutes
what
a
tremendous
gust
there
i
knew
that
window-fastening
was
no
use
ah
i
thought
so--both
candles
out
it
is
enough
to
tear
the
room
to
pieces
the
first
thing
was
to
get
the
window
shut
while
you
might
count
twenty
parkins
was
struggling
with
the
small
casement
and
felt
almost
as
if
he
were
pushing
back
a
sturdy
burglar
so
strong
was
the
pressure
it
slackened
all
at
once
and
the
window
banged
to
and
latched
itself
now
to
relight
the
candles
and
see
what
damage
if
any
had
been
done
no
nothing
seemed
amiss
no
glass
even
was
broken
in
the
casement
but
the
noise
had
evidently
roused
at
least
one
member
of
the
household
the
colonel
was
to
be
heard
stumping
in
his
stockinged
feet
on
the
floor
above
and
growling
quickly
as
it
had
risen
the
wind
did
not
fall
at
once
on
it
went
moaning
and
rushing
past
the
house
at
times
rising
to
a
cry
so
desolate
that
as
parkins
disinterestedly
said
it
might
have
made
fanciful
people
feel
quite
uncomfortable
even
the
unimaginative
he
thought
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
might
be
happier
without
it
whether
it
was
the
wind
or
the
excitement
of
golf
or
of
the
researches
in
the
preceptory
that
kept
parkins
awake
he
was
not
sure
awake
he
remained
in
any
case
long
enough
to
fancy
as
i
am
afraid
i
often
do
myself
under
such
conditions
that
he
was
the
victim
of
all
manner
of
fatal
disorders
he
would
lie
counting
the
beats
of
his
heart
convinced
that
it
was
going
to
stop
work
every
moment
and
would
entertain
grave
suspicions
of
his
lungs
brain
liver
etc--suspicions
which
he
was
sure
would
be
dispelled
by
the
return
of
daylight
but
which
until
then
refused
to
be
put
aside
he
found
a
little
vicarious
comfort
in
the
idea
that
someone
else
was
in
the
same
boat
a
near
neighbour
in
the
darkness
it
was
not
easy
to
tell
his
direction
was
tossing
and
rustling
in
his
bed
too
the
next
stage
was
that
parkins
shut
his
eyes
and
determined
to
give
sleep
every
chance
here
again
over-excitement
asserted
itself
in
another
form--that
of
making
pictures
experto
crede
pictures
do
come
to
the
closed
eyes
of
one
trying
to
sleep
and
are
often
so
little
to
his
taste
that
he
must
open
his
eyes
and
disperse
them
parkins's
experience
on
this
occasion
was
a
very
distressing
one
he
found
that
the
picture
which
presented
itself
to
him
was
continuous
when
he
opened
his
eyes
of
course
it
went
but
when
he
shut
them
once
more
it
framed
itself
afresh
and
acted
itself
out
again
neither
quicker
nor
slower
than
before
what
he
saw
was
this
a
long
stretch
of
shore--shingle
edged
by
sand
and
intersected
at
short
intervals
with
black
groynes
running
down
to
the
water--a
scene
in
fact
so
like
that
of
his
afternoon's
walk
that
in
the
absence
of
any
landmark
it
could
not
be
distinguished
therefrom
the
light
was
obscure
conveying
an
impression
of
gathering
storm
late
winter
evening
and
slight
cold
rain
on
this
bleak
stage
at
first
no
actor
was
visible
then
in
the
distance
a
bobbing
black
object
appeared
a
moment
more
and
it
was
a
man
running
jumping
clambering
over
the
groynes
and
every
few
seconds
looking
eagerly
back
the
nearer
he
came
the
more
obvious
it
was
that
he
was
not
only
anxious
but
even
terribly
frightened
though
his
face
was
not
to
be
distinguished
he
was
moreover
almost
at
the
end
of
his
strength
on
he
came
each
successive
obstacle
seemed
to
cause
him
more
difficulty
than
the
last
'will
he
get
over
this
next
one'
thought
parkins
'it
seems
a
little
higher
than
the
others'
yes
half
climbing
half
throwing
himself
he
did
get
over
and
fell
all
in
a
heap
on
the
other
side
the
side
nearest
to
the
spectator
there
as
if
really
unable
to
get
up
again
he
remained
crouching
under
the
groyne
looking
up
in
an
attitude
of
painful
anxiety
so
far
no
cause
whatever
for
the
fear
of
the
runner
had
been
shown
but
now
there
began
to
be
seen
far
up
the
shore
a
little
flicker
of
something
light-coloured
moving
to
and
fro
with
great
swiftness
and
irregularity
rapidly
growing
larger
it
too
declared
itself
as
a
figure
in
pale
fluttering
draperies
ill-defined
there
was
something
about
its
motion
which
made
parkins
very
unwilling
to
see
it
at
close
quarters
it
would
stop
raise
arms
bow
itself
towards
the
sand
then
run
stooping
across
the
beach
to
the
water-edge
and
back
again
and
then
rising
upright
once
more
continue
its
course
forward
at
a
speed
that
was
startling
and
terrifying
the
moment
came
when
the
pursuer
was
hovering
about
from
left
to
right
only
a
few
yards
beyond
the
groyne
where
the
runner
lay
in
hiding
after
two
or
three
ineffectual
castings
hither
and
thither
it
came
to
a
stop
stood
upright
with
arms
raised
high
and
then
darted
straight
forward
towards
the
groyne
it
was
at
this
point
that
parkins
always
failed
in
his
resolution
to
keep
his
eyes
shut
with
many
misgivings
as
to
incipient
failure
of
eyesight
overworked
brain
excessive
smoking
and
so
on
he
finally
resigned
himself
to
light
his
candle
get
out
a
book
and
pass
the
night
waking
rather
than
be
tormented
by
this
persistent
panorama
which
he
saw
clearly
enough
could
only
be
a
morbid
reflection
of
his
walk
and
his
thoughts
on
that
very
day
the
scraping
of
match
on
box
and
the
glare
of
light
must
have
startled
some
creatures
of
the
night--rats
or
what
not--which
he
heard
scurry
across
the
floor
from
the
side
of
his
bed
with
much
rustling
dear
dear
the
match
is
out
fool
that
it
is
but
the
second
one
burnt
better
and
a
candle
and
book
were
duly
procured
over
which
parkins
pored
till
sleep
of
a
wholesome
kind
came
upon
him
and
that
in
no
long
space
for
about
the
first
time
in
his
orderly
and
prudent
life
he
forgot
to
blow
out
the
candle
and
when
he
was
called
next
morning
at
eight
there
was
still
a
flicker
in
the
socket
and
a
sad
mess
of
guttered
grease
on
the
top
of
the
little
table
after
breakfast
he
was
in
his
room
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
his
golfing
costume--fortune
had
again
allotted
the
colonel
to
him
for
a
partner--when
one
of
the
maids
came
in
'oh
if
you
please'
she
said
'would
you
like
any
extra
blankets
on
your
bed
sir'
'ah
thank
you'
said
parkins
'yes
i
think
i
should
like
one
it
seems
likely
to
turn
rather
colder'
in
a
very
short
time
the
maid
was
back
with
the
blanket
'which
bed
should
i
put
it
on
sir'
she
asked
'what
why
that
one--the
one
i
slept
in
last
night'
he
said
pointing
to
it
'oh
yes
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
you
seemed
to
have
tried
both
of
'em
leastways
we
had
to
make
'em
both
up
this
morning'
'really
how
very
absurd'
said
parkins
'i
certainly
never
touched
the
other
except
to
lay
some
things
on
it
did
it
actually
seem
to
have
been
slept
in'
'oh
yes
sir'
said
the
maid
'why
all
the
things
was
crumpled
and
throwed
about
all
ways
if
you'll
excuse
me
sir--quite
as
if
anyone
'adn't
passed
but
a
very
poor
night
sir'
'dear
me'
said
parkins
'well
i
may
have
disordered
it
more
than
i
thought
when
i
unpacked
my
things
i'm
very
sorry
to
have
given
you
the
extra
trouble
i'm
sure
i
expect
a
friend
of
mine
soon
by
the
way--a
gentleman
from
cambridge--to
come
and
occupy
it
for
a
night
or
two
that
will
be
all
right
i
suppose
won't
it'
'oh
yes
to
be
sure
sir
thank
you
sir
it's
no
trouble
i'm
sure'
said
the
maid
and
departed
to
giggle
with
her
colleagues
parkins
set
forth
with
a
stern
determination
to
improve
his
game
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
report
that
he
succeeded
so
far
in
this
enterprise
that
the
colonel
who
had
been
rather
repining
at
the
prospect
of
a
second
day's
play
in
his
company
became
quite
chatty
as
the
morning
advanced
and
his
voice
boomed
out
over
the
flats
as
certain
also
of
our
own
minor
poets
have
said
'like
some
great
bourdon
in
a
minster
tower'
'extraordinary
wind
that
we
had
last
night'
he
said
'in
my
old
home
we
should
have
said
someone
had
been
whistling
for
it'
'should
you
indeed'
said
perkins
'is
there
a
superstition
of
that
kind
still
current
in
your
part
of
the
country'
'i
don't
know
about
superstition'
said
the
colonel
'they
believe
in
it
all
over
denmark
and
norway
as
well
as
on
the
yorkshire
coast
and
my
experience
is
mind
you
that
there's
generally
something
at
the
bottom
of
what
these
country-folk
hold
to
and
have
held
to
for
generations
but
it's
your
drive'
or
whatever
it
might
have
been
the
golfing
reader
will
have
to
imagine
appropriate
digressions
at
the
proper
intervals
when
conversation
was
resumed
parkins
said
with
a
slight
hesitancy
'a
propos
of
what
you
were
saying
just
now
colonel
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
my
own
views
on
such
subjects
are
very
strong
i
am
in
fact
a
convinced
disbeliever
in
what
is
called
the
supernatural'
'what'
said
the
colonel'do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
don't
believe
in
second-sight
or
ghosts
or
anything
of
that
kind'
'in
nothing
whatever
of
that
kind'
returned
parkins
firmly
'well'
said
the
colonel
'but
it
appears
to
me
at
that
rate
sir
that
you
must
be
little
better
than
a
sadducee'
parkins
was
on
the
point
of
answering
that
in
his
opinion
the
sadducees
were
the
most
sensible
persons
he
had
ever
read
of
in
the
old
testament
but
feeling
some
doubt
as
to
whether
much
mention
of
them
was
to
be
found
in
that
work
he
preferred
to
laugh
the
accusation
off
'perhaps
i
am'
he
said
'but--here
give
me
my
cleek
boy--excuse
me
one
moment
colonel'
a
short
interval
'now
as
to
whistling
for
the
wind
let
me
give
you
my
theory
about
it
the
laws
which
govern
winds
are
really
not
at
all
perfectly
known--to
fisherfolk
and
such
of
course
not
known
at
all
a
man
or
woman
of
eccentric
habits
perhaps
or
a
stranger
is
seen
repeatedly
on
the
beach
at
some
unusual
hour
and
is
heard
whistling
soon
afterwards
a
violent
wind
rises
a
man
who
could
read
the
sky
perfectly
or
who
possessed
a
barometer
could
have
foretold
that
it
would
the
simple
people
of
a
fishing-village
have
no
barometers
and
only
a
few
rough
rules
for
prophesying
weather
what
more
natural
than
that
the
eccentric
personage
i
postulated
should
be
regarded
as
having
raised
the
wind
or
that
he
or
she
should
clutch
eagerly
at
the
reputation
of
being
able
to
do
so
now
take
last
night's
wind
as
it
happens
i
myself
was
whistling
i
blew
a
whistle
twice
and
the
wind
seemed
to
come
absolutely
in
answer
to
my
call
if
anyone
had
seen
me--'
the
audience
had
been
a
little
restive
under
this
harangue
and
parkins
had
i
fear
fallen
somewhat
into
the
tone
of
a
lecturer
but
at
the
last
sentence
the
colonel
stopped
'whistling
were
you'
he
said
'and
what
sort
of
whistle
did
you
use
play
this
stroke
first'
interval
'about
that
whistle
you
were
asking
colonel
it's
rather
a
curious
one
i
have
it
in
my--no
i
see
i've
left
it
in
my
room
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
found
it
yesterday'
and
then
parkins
narrated
the
manner
of
his
discovery
of
the
whistle
upon
hearing
which
the
colonel
grunted
and
opined
that
in
parkins's
place
he
should
himself
be
careful
about
using
a
thing
that
had
belonged
to
a
set
of
papists
of
whom
speaking
generally
it
might
be
affirmed
that
you
never
knew
what
they
might
not
have
been
up
to
from
this
topic
he
diverged
to
the
enormities
of
the
vicar
who
had
given
notice
on
the
previous
sunday
that
friday
would
be
the
feast
of
st
thomas
the
apostle
and
that
there
would
be
service
at
eleven
o'clock
in
the
church
this
and
other
similar
proceedings
constituted
in
the
colonel's
view
a
strong
presumption
that
the
vicar
was
a
concealed
papist
if
not
a
jesuit
and
parkins
who
could
not
very
readily
follow
the
colonel
in
this
region
did
not
disagree
with
him
in
fact
they
got
on
so
well
together
in
the
morning
that
there
was
not
talk
on
either
side
of
their
separating
after
lunch
both
continued
to
play
well
during
the
afternoon
or
at
least
well
enough
to
make
them
forget
everything
else
until
the
light
began
to
fail
them
not
until
then
did
parkins
remember
that
he
had
meant
to
do
some
more
investigating
at
the
preceptory
but
it
was
of
no
great
importance
he
reflected
one
day
was
as
good
as
another
he
might
as
well
go
home
with
the
colonel
as
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
the
colonel
was
almost
knocked
down
by
a
boy
who
rushed
into
him
at
the
very
top
of
his
speed
and
then
instead
of
running
away
remained
hanging
on
to
him
and
panting
the
first
words
of
the
warrior
were
naturally
those
of
reproof
and
objurgation
but
he
very
quickly
discerned
that
the
boy
was
almost
speechless
with
fright
inquiries
were
useless
at
first
when
the
boy
got
his
breath
he
began
to
howl
and
still
clung
to
the
colonel's
legs
he
was
at
last
detached
but
continued
to
howl
'what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
with
you
what
have
you
been
up
to
what
have
you
seen'
said
the
two
men
'ow
i
seen
it
wive
at
me
out
of
the
winder'
wailed
the
boy
'and
i
don't
like
it'
'what
window'
said
the
irritated
colonel
'come
pull
yourself
together
my
boy'
'the
front
winder
it
was
at
the
'otel'
said
the
boy
at
this
point
parkins
was
in
favour
of
sending
the
boy
home
but
the
colonel
refused
he
wanted
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
he
said
it
was
most
dangerous
to
give
a
boy
such
a
fright
as
this
one
had
had
and
if
it
turned
out
that
people
had
been
playing
jokes
they
should
suffer
for
it
in
some
way
and
by
a
series
of
questions
he
made
out
this
story
the
boy
had
been
playing
about
on
the
grass
in
front
of
the
globe
with
some
others
then
they
had
gone
home
to
their
teas
and
he
was
just
going
when
he
happened
to
look
up
at
the
front
winder
and
see
it
a-wiving
at
him
it
seemed
to
be
a
figure
of
some
sort
in
white
as
far
as
he
knew--couldn't
see
its
face
but
it
wived
at
him
and
it
warn't
a
right
thing--not
to
say
not
a
right
person
was
there
a
light
in
the
room
no
he
didn't
think
to
look
if
there
was
a
light
which
was
the
window
was
it
the
top
one
or
the
second
one
the
seckind
one
it
was--the
big
winder
what
got
two
little
uns
at
the
sides
'very
well
my
boy'
said
the
colonel
after
a
few
more
questions
'you
run
away
home
now
i
expect
it
was
some
person
trying
to
give
you
a
start
another
time
like
a
brave
english
boy
you
just
throw
a
stone--well
no
not
that
exactly
but
you
go
and
speak
to
the
waiter
or
to
mr
simpson
the
landlord
and--yes--and
say
that
i
advised
you
to
do
so'
the
boy's
face
expressed
some
of
the
doubt
he
felt
as
to
the
likelihood
of
mr
simpson's
lending
a
favourable
ear
to
his
complaint
but
the
colonel
did
not
appear
to
perceive
this
and
went
on
'and
here's
a
sixpence--no
i
see
it's
a
shilling--and
you
be
off
home
and
don't
think
any
more
about
it'
the
youth
hurried
off
with
agitated
thanks
and
the
colonel
and
parkins
went
round
to
the
front
of
the
globe
and
reconnoitred
there
was
only
one
window
answering
to
the
description
they
had
been
hearing
'well
that's
curious'
said
parkins
'it's
evidently
my
window
the
lad
was
talking
about
will
you
come
up
for
a
moment
colonel
wilson
we
ought
to
be
able
to
see
if
anyone
has
been
taking
liberties
in
my
room'
they
were
soon
in
the
passage
and
parkins
made
as
if
to
open
the
door
then
he
stopped
and
felt
in
his
pockets
'this
is
more
serious
than
i
thought'
was
his
next
remark
'i
remember
now
that
before
i
started
this
morning
i
locked
the
door
it
is
locked
now
and
what
is
more
here
is
the
key'
and
he
held
it
up
'now'
he
went
on
'if
the
servants
are
in
the
habit
of
going
into
one's
room
during
the
day
when
one
is
away
i
can
only
say
that--well
that
i
don't
approve
of
it
at
all'
conscious
of
a
somewhat
weak
climax
he
busied
himself
in
opening
the
door
which
was
indeed
locked
and
in
lighting
candles
'no'
he
said
'nothing
seems
disturbed'
'except
your
bed'
put
in
the
colonel
'excuse
me
that
isn't
my
bed'
said
parkins
'i
don't
use
that
one
but
it
does
look
as
if
someone
had
been
playing
tricks
with
it'
it
certainly
did
the
clothes
were
bundled
up
and
twisted
together
in
a
most
tortuous
confusion
parkins
pondered
'that
must
be
it'
he
said
at
last
'i
disordered
the
clothes
last
night
in
unpacking
and
they
haven't
made
it
since
perhaps
they
came
in
to
make
it
and
that
boy
saw
them
through
the
window
and
then
they
were
called
away
and
locked
the
door
after
them
yes
i
think
that
must
be
it'
'well
ring
and
ask'
said
the
colonel
and
this
appealed
to
parkins
as
practical
the
maid
appeared
and
to
make
a
long
story
short
deposed
that
she
had
made
the
bed
in
the
morning
when
the
gentleman
was
in
the
room
and
hadn't
been
there
since
no
she
hadn't
no
other
key
mr
simpson
he
kep'
the
keys
he'd
be
able
to
tell
the
gentleman
if
anyone
had
been
up
this
was
a
puzzle
investigation
showed
that
nothing
of
value
had
been
taken
and
parkins
remembered
the
disposition
of
the
small
objects
on
tables
and
so
forth
well
enough
to
be
pretty
sure
that
no
pranks
had
been
played
with
them
mr
and
mrs
simpson
furthermore
agreed
that
neither
of
them
had
given
the
duplicate
key
of
the
room
to
any
person
whatever
during
the
day
nor
could
parkins
fair-minded
man
as
he
was
detect
anything
in
the
demeanour
of
master
mistress
or
maid
that
indicated
guilt
he
was
much
more
inclined
to
think
that
the
boy
had
been
imposing
on
the
colonel
the
latter
was
unwontedly
silent
and
pensive
at
dinner
and
throughout
the
evening
when
he
bade
goodnight
to
parkins
he
murmured
in
a
gruff
undertone
'you
know
where
i
am
if
you
want
me
during
the
night'
'why
yes
thank
you
colonel
wilson
i
think
i
do
but
there
isn't
much
prospect
of
my
disturbing
you
i
hope
by
the
way'
he
added
'did
i
show
you
that
old
whistle
i
spoke
of
i
think
not
well
here
it
is'
the
colonel
turned
it
over
gingerly
in
the
light
of
the
candle
'can
you
make
anything
of
the
inscription'
asked
parkins
as
he
took
it
back
'no
not
in
this
light
what
do
you
mean
to
do
with
it'
'oh
well
when
i
get
back
to
cambridge
i
shall
submit
it
to
some
of
the
archaeologists
there
and
see
what
they
think
of
it
and
very
likely
if
they
consider
it
worth
having
i
may
present
it
to
one
of
the
museums'
'm'
said
the
colonel
'well
you
may
be
right
all
i
know
is
that
if
it
were
mine
i
should
chuck
it
straight
into
the
sea
it's
no
use
talking
i'm
well
aware
but
i
expect
that
with
you
it's
a
case
of
live
and
learn
i
hope
so
i'm
sure
and
i
wish
you
a
good
night'
he
turned
away
leaving
parkins
in
act
to
speak
at
the
bottom
of
the
stair
and
soon
each
was
in
his
own
bedroom
by
some
unfortunate
accident
there
were
neither
blinds
nor
curtains
to
the
windows
of
the
professor's
room
the
previous
night
he
had
thought
little
of
this
but
tonight
there
seemed
every
prospect
of
a
bright
moon
rising
to
shine
directly
on
his
bed
and
probably
wake
him
later
on
when
he
noticed
this
he
was
a
good
deal
annoyed
but
with
an
ingenuity
which
i
can
only
envy
he
succeeded
in
rigging
up
with
the
help
of
a
railway-rug
some
safety-pins
and
a
stick
and
umbrella
a
screen
which
if
it
only
held
together
would
completely
keep
the
moonlight
off
his
bed
and
shortly
afterwards
he
was
comfortably
in
that
bed
when
he
had
read
a
somewhat
solid
work
long
enough
to
produce
a
decided
wish
to
sleep
he
cast
a
drowsy
glance
round
the
room
blew
out
the
candle
and
fell
back
upon
the
pillow
he
must
have
slept
soundly
for
an
hour
or
more
when
a
sudden
clatter
shook
him
up
in
a
most
unwelcome
manner
in
a
moment
he
realized
what
had
happened
his
carefully-constructed
screen
had
given
way
and
a
very
bright
frosty
moon
was
shining
directly
on
his
face
this
was
highly
annoying
could
he
possibly
get
up
and
reconstruct
the
screen
or
could
he
manage
to
sleep
if
he
did
not
for
some
minutes
he
lay
and
pondered
over
all
the
possibilities
then
he
turned
over
sharply
and
with
his
eyes
open
lay
breathlessly
listening
there
had
been
a
movement
he
was
sure
in
the
empty
bed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
tomorrow
he
would
have
it
moved
for
there
must
be
rats
or
something
playing
about
in
it
it
was
quiet
now
no
the
commotion
began
again
there
was
a
rustling
and
shaking
surely
more
than
any
rat
could
cause
i
can
figure
to
myself
something
of
the
professor's
bewilderment
and
horror
for
i
have
in
a
dream
thirty
years
back
seen
the
same
thing
happen
but
the
reader
will
hardly
perhaps
imagine
how
dreadful
it
was
to
him
to
see
a
figure
suddenly
sit
up
in
what
he
had
known
was
an
empty
bed
he
was
out
of
his
own
bed
in
one
bound
and
made
a
dash
towards
the
window
where
lay
his
only
weapon
the
stick
with
which
he
had
propped
his
screen
this
was
as
it
turned
out
the
worst
thing
he
could
have
done
because
the
personage
in
the
empty
bed
with
a
sudden
smooth
motion
slipped
from
the
bed
and
took
up
a
position
with
outspread
arms
between
the
two
beds
and
in
front
of
the
door
parkins
watched
it
in
a
horrid
perplexity
somehow
the
idea
of
getting
past
it
and
escaping
through
the
door
was
intolerable
to
him
he
could
not
have
borne--he
didn't
know
why--to
touch
it
and
as
for
its
touching
him
he
would
sooner
dash
himself
through
the
window
than
have
that
happen
it
stood
for
the
moment
in
a
band
of
dark
shadow
and
he
had
not
seen
what
its
face
was
like
now
it
began
to
move
in
a
stooping
posture
and
all
at
once
the
spectator
realized
with
some
horror
and
some
relief
that
it
must
be
blind
for
it
seemed
to
feel
about
it
with
its
muffled
arms
in
a
groping
and
random
fashion
turning
half
away
from
him
it
became
suddenly
conscious
of
the
bed
he
had
just
left
and
darted
towards
it
and
bent
and
felt
over
the
pillows
in
a
way
which
made
parkins
shudder
as
he
had
never
in
his
life
thought
it
possible
in
a
very
few
moments
it
seemed
to
know
that
the
bed
was
empty
and
then
moving
forward
into
the
area
of
light
and
facing
the
window
it
showed
for
the
first
time
what
manner
of
thing
it
was
parkins
who
very
much
dislikes
being
questioned
about
it
did
once
describe
something
of
it
in
my
hearing
and
i
gathered
that
what
he
chiefly
remembers
about
it
is
a
horrible
an
intensely
horrible
face
of
crumpled
linen
what
expression
he
read
upon
it
he
could
not
or
would
not
tell
but
that
the
fear
of
it
went
nigh
to
maddening
him
is
certain
but
he
was
not
at
leisure
to
watch
it
for
long
with
formidable
quickness
it
moved
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
as
it
groped
and
waved
one
corner
of
its
draperies
swept
across
parkins's
face
he
could
not
though
he
knew
how
perilous
a
sound
was--he
could
not
keep
back
a
cry
of
disgust
and
this
gave
the
searcher
an
instant
clue
it
leapt
towards
him
upon
the
instant
and
the
next
moment
he
was
half-way
through
the
window
backwards
uttering
cry
upon
cry
at
the
utmost
pitch
of
his
voice
and
the
linen
face
was
thrust
close
into
his
own
at
this
almost
the
last
possible
second
deliverance
came
as
you
will
have
guessed
the
colonel
burst
the
door
open
and
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
dreadful
group
at
the
window
when
he
reached
the
figures
only
one
was
left
parkins
sank
forward
into
the
room
in
a
faint
and
before
him
on
the
floor
lay
a
tumbled
heap
of
bed-clothes
colonel
wilson
asked
no
questions
but
busied
himself
in
keeping
everyone
else
out
of
the
room
and
in
getting
parkins
back
to
his
bed
and
himself
wrapped
in
a
rug
occupied
the
other
bed
for
the
rest
of
the
night
early
on
the
next
day
rogers
arrived
more
welcome
than
he
would
have
been
a
day
before
and
the
three
of
them
held
a
very
long
consultation
in
the
professor's
room
at
the
end
of
it
the
colonel
left
the
hotel
door
carrying
a
small
object
between
his
finger
and
thumb
which
he
cast
as
far
into
the
sea
as
a
very
brawny
arm
could
send
it
later
on
the
smoke
of
a
burning
ascended
from
the
back
premises
of
the
globe
exactly
what
explanation
was
patched
up
for
the
staff
and
visitors
at
the
hotel
i
must
confess
i
do
not
recollect
the
professor
was
somehow
cleared
of
the
ready
suspicion
of
delirium
tremens
and
the
hotel
of
the
reputation
of
a
troubled
house
there
is
not
much
question
as
to
what
would
have
happened
to
parkins
if
the
colonel
had
not
intervened
when
he
did
he
would
either
have
fallen
out
of
the
window
or
else
lost
his
wits
but
it
is
not
so
evident
what
more
the
creature
that
came
in
answer
to
the
whistle
could
have
done
than
frighten
there
seemed
to
be
absolutely
nothing
material
about
it
save
the
bedclothes
of
which
it
had
made
itself
a
body
the
colonel
who
remembered
a
not
very
dissimilar
occurrence
in
india
was
of
the
opinion
that
if
parkins
had
closed
with
it
it
could
really
have
done
very
little
and
that
its
one
power
was
that
of
frightening
the
whole
thing
he
said
served
to
confirm
his
opinion
of
the
church
of
rome
there
is
really
nothing
more
to
tell
but
as
you
may
imagine
the
professor's
views
on
certain
points
are
less
clear
cut
than
they
used
to
be
his
nerves
too
have
suffered
he
cannot
even
now
see
a
surplice
hanging
on
a
door
quite
unmoved
and
the
spectacle
of
a
scarecrow
in
a
field
late
on
a
winter
afternoon
has
cost
him
more
than
one
sleepless
night

'i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
translate
this'
said
the
antiquary
to
himself
as
he
finished
copying
the
above
lines
from
that
rather
rare
and
exceedingly
diffuse
book
the
sertum
steinfeldense
norbertinum5
'well
it
may
as
well
be
done
first
as
last'
and
accordingly
the
following
rendering
was
very
quickly
produced
up
to
the
present
day
there
is
much
gossip
among
the
canons
about
a
certain
hidden
treasure
of
this
abbot
thomas
for
which
those
of
steinfeld
have
often
made
search
though
hitherto
in
vain
the
story
is
that
thomas
while
yet
in
the
vigour
of
life
concealed
a
very
large
quantity
of
gold
somewhere
in
the
monastery
he
was
often
asked
where
it
was
and
always
answered
with
a
laugh
'job
john
and
zechariah
will
tell
either
you
or
your
successors'
he
sometimes
added
that
he
should
feel
no
grudge
against
those
who
might
find
it
among
other
works
carried
out
by
this
abbot
i
may
specially
mention
his
filling
the
great
window
at
the
east
end
of
the
south
aisle
of
the
church
with
figures
admirably
painted
on
glass
as
his
effigy
and
arms
in
the
window
attest
he
also
restored
almost
the
whole
of
the
abbot's
lodging
and
dug
a
well
in
the
court
of
it
which
he
adorned
with
beautiful
carvings
in
marble
he
died
rather
suddenly
in
the
seventy-second
year
of
his
age

an
account
of
the
premonstratensian
abbey
of
steinfeld
in
the
eiffel
with
lives
of
the
abbots
published
at
cologne
in
1712
by
christian
albert
erhard
a
resident
in
the
district
the
epithet
norbertinum
is
due
to
the
fact
that
st
norbert
was
founder
of
the
premonstratensian
order
the
object
which
the
antiquary
had
before
him
at
the
moment
was
that
of
tracing
the
whereabouts
of
the
painted
windows
of
the
abbey
church
at
steinfeld
shortly
after
the
revolution
a
very
large
quantity
of
painted
glass
made
its
way
from
the
dissolved
abbeys
of
germany
and
belgium
to
this
country
and
may
now
be
seen
adorning
various
of
our
parish
churches
cathedrals
and
private
chapels
steinfeld
abbey
was
among
the
most
considerable
of
these
involuntary
contributors
to
our
artistic
possession
i
am
quoting
the
somewhat
ponderous
preamble
of
the
book
which
the
antiquary
wrote
and
the
greater
part
of
the
glass
from
that
institution
can
be
identified
without
much
difficulty
by
the
help
either
of
the
numerous
inscriptions
in
which
the
place
is
mentioned
or
of
the
subjects
of
the
windows
in
which
several
well-defined
cycles
or
narratives
were
represented
the
passage
with
which
i
began
my
story
had
set
the
antiquary
on
the
track
of
another
identification
in
a
private
chapel--no
matter
where--he
had
seen
three
large
figures
each
occupying
a
whole
light
in
a
window
and
evidently
the
work
of
one
artist
their
style
made
it
plain
that
that
artist
had
been
a
german
of
the
sixteenth
century
but
hitherto
the
more
exact
localizing
of
them
had
been
a
puzzle
they
represented--will
you
be
surprised
to
hear
it--job
patriarcha
johannes
evangelista
zacharias
propheta
and
each
of
them
held
a
book
or
scroll
inscribed
with
a
sentence
from
his
writings
these
as
a
matter
of
course
the
antiquary
had
noted
and
had
been
struck
by
the
curious
way
in
which
they
differed
from
any
text
of
the
vulgate
that
he
had
been
able
to
examine
thus
the
scroll
in
job's
hand
was
inscribed
auro
est
locus
in
quo
absconditur
for
conflatur6
on
the
book
of
john
was
habent
in
vestimentis
suis

for
in

the
following
words
being
taken
from
another
verse
and
zacharias
had
super
lapidem
unum
septem

which
alone
of
the
three
presents
an
unaltered
text
6
there
is
a
place

where
it
is
hidden
7
they
have
on
their
raiment
a
writing
which
no
man
knoweth
8
upon
one
stone
are
seven
eyes
a
sad
perplexity
it
had
been
to
our
investigator
to
think
why
these
three
personages
should
have
been
placed
together
in
one
window
there
was
no
bond
of
connexion
between
them
either
historic
symbolic
or
doctrinal
and
he
could
only
suppose
that
they
must
have
formed
part
of
a
very
large
series
of
prophets
and
apostles
which
might
have
filled
say
all
the
clerestory
windows
of
some
capacious
church
but
the
passage
from
the
sertum
had
altered
the
situation
by
showing
that
the
names
of
the
actual
personages
represented
in
the
glass
now
in
lord
d----'s
chapel
had
been
constantly
on
the
lips
of
abbot
thomas
von
eschenhausen
of
steinfeld
and
that
this
abbot
had
put
up
a
painted
window
probably
about
the
year
1520
in
the
south
aisle
of
his
abbey
church
it
was
no
very
wild
conjecture
that
the
three
figures
might
have
formed
part
of
abbot
thomas's
offering
it
was
one
which
moreover
could
probably
be
confirmed
or
set
aside
by
another
careful
examination
of
the
glass
and
as
mr
somerton
was
a
man
of
leisure
he
set
out
on
pilgrimage
to
the
private
chapel
with
very
little
delay
his
conjecture
was
confirmed
to
the
full
not
only
did
the
style
and
technique
of
the
glass
suit
perfectly
with
the
date
and
place
required
but
in
another
window
of
the
chapel
he
found
some
glass
known
to
have
been
bought
along
with
the
figures
which
contained
the
arms
of
abbot
thomas
von
eschenhausen
at
intervals
during
his
researches
mr
somerton
had
been
haunted
by
the
recollection
of
the
gossip
about
the
hidden
treasure
and
as
he
thought
the
matter
over
it
became
more
and
more
obvious
to
him
that
if
the
abbot
meant
anything
by
the
enigmatical
answer
which
he
gave
to
his
questioners
he
must
have
meant
that
the
secret
was
to
be
found
somewhere
in
the
window
he
had
placed
in
the
abbey
church
it
was
undeniable
furthermore
that
the
first
of
the
curiously-selected
texts
on
the
scrolls
in
the
window
might
be
taken
to
have
a
reference
to
hidden
treasure
every
feature
therefore
or
mark
which
could
possibly
assist
in
elucidating
the
riddle
which
he
felt
sure
the
abbot
had
set
to
posterity
he
noted
with
scrupulous
care
and
returning
to
his
berkshire
manor-house
consumed
many
a
pint
of
the
midnight
oil
over
his
tracings
and
sketches
after
two
or
three
weeks
a
day
came
when
mr
somerton
announced
to
his
man
that
he
must
pack
his
own
and
his
master's
things
for
a
short
journey
abroad
whither
for
the
moment
we
will
not
follow
him
ii
mr
gregory
the
rector
of
parsbury
had
strolled
out
before
breakfast
it
being
a
fine
autumn
morning
as
far
as
the
gate
of
his
carriage-drive
with
intent
to
meet
the
postman
and
sniff
the
cool
air
nor
was
he
disappointed
of
either
purpose
before
he
had
had
time
to
answer
more
than
ten
or
eleven
of
the
miscellaneous
questions
propounded
to
him
in
the
lightness
of
their
hearts
by
his
young
offspring
who
had
accompanied
him
the
postman
was
seen
approaching
and
among
the
morning's
budget
was
one
letter
bearing
a
foreign
postmark
and
stamp
which
became
at
once
the
objects
of
an
eager
competition
among
the
youthful
gregorys
and
addressed
in
an
uneducated
but
plainly
an
english
hand
when
the
rector
opened
it
and
turned
to
the
signature
he
realized
that
it
came
from
the
confidential
valet
of
his
friend
and
squire
mr
somerton

of
such
a
letter
would
be
likely
to
plunge
a
quiet
berkshire
parsonage
in
the
year
of
grace
1859
it
is
enough
for
me
to
say
that
a
train
to
town
was
caught
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
that
mr
gregory
was
able
to
secure
a
cabin
in
the
antwerp
boat
and
a
place
in
the
coblenz
train
nor
was
it
difficult
to
manage
the
transit
from
that
centre
to
steinfeld
i
labour
under
a
grave
disadvantage
as
narrator
of
this
story
in
that
i
have
never
visited
steinfeld
myself
and
that
neither
of
the
principal
actors
in
the
episode
from
whom
i
derive
my
information
was
able
to
give
me
anything
but
a
vague
and
rather
dismal
idea
of
its
appearance
i
gather
that
it
is
a
small
place
with
a
large
church
despoiled
of
its
ancient
fittings
a
number
of
rather
ruinous
great
buildings
mostly
of
the
seventeenth
century
surround
this
church
for
the
abbey
in
common
with
most
of
those
on
the
continent
was
rebuilt
in
a
luxurious
fashion
by
its
inhabitants
at
that
period
it
has
not
seemed
to
me
worth
while
to
lavish
money
on
a
visit
to
the
place
for
though
it
is
probably
far
more
attractive
than
either
mr
somerton
or
mr
gregory
thought
it
there
is
evidently
little
if
anything
of
first-rate
interest
to
be
seen--except
perhaps
one
thing
which
i
should
not
care
to
see
the
inn
where
the
english
gentleman
and
his
servant
were
lodged
is
or
was
the
only
'possible'
one
in
the
village
mr
gregory
was
taken
to
it
at
once
by
his
driver
and
found
mr
brown
waiting
at
the
door
mr
brown
a
model
when
in
his
berkshire
home
of
the
impassive
whiskered
race
who
are
known
as
confidential
valets
was
now
egregiously
out
of
his
element
in
a
light
tweed
suit
anxious
almost
irritable
and
plainly
anything
but
master
of
the
situation
his
relief
at
the
sight
of
the
'honest
british
face'
of
his
rector
was
unmeasured
but
words
to
describe
it
were
denied
him
he
could
only
say
'well
i
ham
pleased
i'm
sure
sir
to
see
you
and
so
i'm
sure
sir
will
master'
'how
is
your
master
brown'
mr
gregory
eagerly
put
in
'i
think
he's
better
sir
thank
you
but
he's
had
a
dreadful
time
of
it
i
'ope
he's
gettin'
some
sleep
now
but--'
'what
has
been
the
matter--i
couldn't
make
out
from
your
letter
was
it
an
accident
of
any
kind'
'well
sir
i
'ardly
know
whether
i'd
better
speak
about
it
master
was
very
partickler
he
should
be
the
one
to
tell
you
but
there's
no
bones
broke--that's
one
thing
i'm
sure
we
ought
to
be
thankful--'
'what
does
the
doctor
say'
asked
mr
gregory
they
were
by
this
time
outside
mr
somerton's
bedroom
door
and
speaking
in
low
tones
mr
gregory
who
happened
to
be
in
front
was
feeling
for
the
handle
and
chanced
to
run
his
fingers
over
the
panels
before
brown
could
answer
there
was
a
terrible
cry
from
within
the
room
'in
god's
name
who
is
that'
were
the
first
words
they
heard
'brown
is
it'
'yes
sir--me
sir
and
mr
gregory'
brown
hastened
to
answer
and
there
was
an
audible
groan
of
relief
in
reply
they
entered
the
room
which
was
darkened
against
the
afternoon
sun
and
mr
gregory
saw
with
a
shock
of
pity
how
drawn
how
damp
with
drops
of
fear
was
the
usually
calm
face
of
his
friend
who
sitting
up
in
the
curtained
bed
stretched
out
a
shaking
hand
to
welcome
him
'better
for
seeing
you
my
dear
gregory'
was
the
reply
to
the
rector's
first
question
and
it
was
palpably
true
after
five
minutes
of
conversation
mr
somerton
was
more
his
own
man
brown
afterwards
reported
than
he
had
been
for
days
he
was
able
to
eat
a
more
than
respectable
dinner
and
talked
confidently
of
being
fit
to
stand
a
journey
to
coblenz
within
twenty-four
hours
'but
there's
one
thing'
he
said
with
a
return
of
agitation
which
mr
gregory
did
not
like
to
see
'which
i
must
beg
you
to
do
for
me
my
dear
gregory
don't'
he
went
on
laying
his
hand
on
gregory's
to
forestall
any
interruption--'don't
ask
me
what
it
is
or
why
i
want
it
done
i'm
not
up
to
explaining
it
yet
it
would
throw
me
back--undo
all
the
good
you
have
done
me
by
coming
the
only
word
i
will
say
about
it
is
that
you
run
no
risk
whatever
by
doing
it
and
that
brown
can
and
will
show
you
tomorrow
what
it
is
it's
merely
to
put
back--to
keep--something--no
i
can't
speak
of
it
yet
do
you
mind
calling
brown'
'well
somerton'
said
mr
gregory
as
he
crossed
the
room
to
the
door
'i
won't
ask
for
any
explanations
till
you
see
fit
to
give
them
and
if
this
bit
of
business
is
as
easy
as
you
represent
it
to
be
i
will
very
gladly
undertake
it
for
you
the
first
thing
in
the
morning'
'ah
i
was
sure
you
would
my
dear
gregory
i
was
certain
i
could
rely
on
you
i
shall
owe
you
more
thanks
than
i
can
tell
now
here
is
brown
brown
one
word
with
you'
'shall
i
go'
interjected
mr
gregory
'not
at
all
dear
me
no
brown
the
first
thing
tomorrow
morning--you
don't
mind
early
hours
i
know
gregory--you
must
take
the
rector
to--there
you
know'
a
nod
from
brown
who
looked
grave
and
anxious
'and
he
and
you
will
put
that
back
you
needn't
be
in
the
least
alarmed
it's
perfectly
safe
in
the
daytime
you
know
what
i
mean
it
lies
on
the
step
you
know
where--where
we
put
it'
brown
swallowed
dryly
once
or
twice
and
failing
to
speak
bowed
'and--yes
that's
all
only
this
one
other
word
my
dear
gregory
if
you
can
manage
to
keep
from
questioning
brown
about
this
matter
i
shall
be
still
more
bound
to
you
tomorrow
evening
at
latest
if
all
goes
well
i
shall
be
able
i
believe
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
from
start
to
finish
and
now
i'll
wish
you
good
night
brown
will
be
with
me--he
sleeps
here--and
if
i
were
you
i
should
lock
my
door
yes
be
particular
to
do
that
they--they
like
it
the
people
here
and
it's
better
good
night
good
night'
they
parted
upon
this
and
if
mr
gregory
woke
once
or
twice
in
the
small
hours
and
fancied
he
heard
a
fumbling
about
the
lower
part
of
his
locked
door
it
was
perhaps
no
more
than
what
a
quiet
man
suddenly
plunged
into
a
strange
bed
and
the
heart
of
a
mystery
might
reasonably
expect
certainly
he
thought
to
the
end
of
his
days
that
he
had
heard
such
a
sound
twice
or
three
times
between
midnight
and
dawn
he
was
up
with
the
sun
and
out
in
company
with
brown
soon
after
perplexing
as
was
the
service
he
had
been
asked
to
perform
for
mr
somerton
it
was
not
a
difficult
or
an
alarming
one
and
within
half
an
hour
from
his
leaving
the
inn
it
was
over
what
it
was
i
shall
not
as
yet
divulge
later
in
the
morning
mr
somerton
now
almost
himself
again
was
able
to
make
a
start
from
steinfeld
and
that
same
evening
whether
at
coblenz
or
at
some
intermediate
stage
on
the
journey
i
am
not
certain
he
settled
down
to
the
promised
explanation
brown
was
present
but
how
much
of
the
matter
was
ever
really
made
plain
to
his
comprehension
he
would
never
say
and
i
am
unable
to
conjecture
iii
this
was
mr
somerton's
story
'you
know
roughly
both
of
you
that
this
expedition
of
mine
was
undertaken
with
the
object
of
tracing
something
in
connexion
with
some
old
painted
glass
in
lord
d----'s
private
chapel
well
the
starting-point
of
the
whole
matter
lies
in
this
passage
from
an
old
printed
book
to
which
i
will
ask
your
attention'
and
at
this
point
mr
somerton
went
carefully
over
some
ground
with
which
we
are
already
familiar
'on
my
second
visit
to
the
chapel'
he
went
on
'my
purpose
was
to
take
every
note
i
could
of
figures
lettering
diamond-scratchings
on
the
glass
and
even
apparently
accidental
markings
the
first
point
which
i
tackled
was
that
of
the
inscribed
scrolls
i
could
not
doubt
that
the
first
of
these
that
of
job--there
is
a
place
for
the
gold
where
it
is
hidden--with
its
intentional
alteration
must
refer
to
the
treasure
so
i
applied
myself
with
some
confidence
to
the
next
that
of
st
john--they
have
on
their
vestures
a
writing
which
no
man
knoweth
the
natural
question
will
have
occurred
to
you
was
there
an
inscription
on
the
robes
of
the
figures
i
could
see
none
each
of
the
three
had
a
broad
black
border
to
his
mantle
which
made
a
conspicuous
and
rather
ugly
feature
in
the
window
i
was
nonplussed
i
will
own
and
but
for
a
curious
bit
of
luck
i
think
i
should
have
left
the
search
where
the
canons
of
steinfeld
had
left
it
before
me
but
it
so
happened
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
dust
on
the
surface
of
the
glass
and
lord
d----
happening
to
come
in
noticed
my
blackened
hands
and
kindly
insisted
on
sending
for
a
turk's
head
broom
to
clean
down
the
window
there
must
i
suppose
have
been
a
rough
piece
in
the
broom
anyhow
as
it
passed
over
the
border
of
one
of
the
mantles
i
noticed
that
it
left
a
long
scratch
and
that
some
yellow
stain
instantly
showed
up
i
asked
the
man
to
stop
his
work
for
a
moment
and
ran
up
the
ladder
to
examine
the
place
the
yellow
stain
was
there
sure
enough
and
what
had
come
away
was
a
thick
black
pigment
which
had
evidently
been
laid
on
with
the
brush
after
the
glass
had
been
burnt
and
could
therefore
be
easily
scraped
off
without
doing
any
harm
i
scraped
accordingly
and
you
will
hardly
believe--no
i
do
you
an
injustice
you
will
have
guessed
already--that
i
found
under
this
black
pigment
two
or
three
clearly-formed
capital
letters
in
yellow
stain
on
a
clear
ground
of
course
i
could
hardly
contain
my
delight
'i
told
lord
d----
that
i
had
detected
an
inscription
which
i
thought
might
be
very
interesting
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
uncover
the
whole
of
it
he
made
no
difficulty
about
it
whatever
told
me
to
do
exactly
as
i
pleased
and
then
having
an
engagement
was
obliged--rather
to
my
relief
i
must
say--to
leave
me
i
set
to
work
at
once
and
found
the
task
a
fairly
easy
one
the
pigment
disintegrated
of
course
by
time
came
off
almost
at
a
touch
and
i
don't
think
that
it
took
me
a
couple
of
hours
all
told
to
clean
the
whole
of
the
black
borders
in
all
three
lights
each
of
the
figures
had
as
the
inscription
said
a
writing
on
their
vestures
which
nobody
knew
'this
discovery
of
course
made
it
absolutely
certain
to
my
mind
that
i
was
on
the
right
track
and
now
what
was
the
inscription
while
i
was
cleaning
the
glass
i
almost
took
pains
not
to
read
the
lettering
saving
up
the
treat
until
i
had
got
the
whole
thing
clear
and
when
that
was
done
my
dear
gregory
i
assure
you
i
could
almost
have
cried
from
sheer
disappointment
what
i
read
was
only
the
most
hopeless
jumble
of
letters
that
was
ever
shaken
up

a
hat

'blank
as
i
felt
and
must
have
looked
for
the
first
few
minutes
my
disappointment
didn't
last
long
i
realized
almost
at
once
that
i
was
dealing
with
a
cipher
or
cryptogram
and
i
reflected
that
it
was
likely
to
be
of
a
pretty
simple
kind
considering
its
early
date
so
i
copied
the
letters
with
the
most
anxious
care
another
little
point
i
may
tell
you
turned
up
in
the
process
which
confirmed
my
belief
in
the
cipher
after
copying
the
letters
on
job's
robe
i
counted
them
to
make
sure
that
i
had
them
right
there
were
thirty-eight
and
just
as
i
finished
going
through
them
my
eye
fell
on
a
scratching
made
with
a
sharp
point
on
the
edge
of
the
border
it
was
simply
the
number
xxxviii
in
roman
numerals
to
cut
the
matter
short
there
was
a
similar
note
as
i
may
call
it
in
each
of
the
other
lights
and
that
made
it
plain
to
me
that
the
glass-painter
had
had
very
strict
orders
from
abbot
thomas
about
the
inscription
and
had
taken
pains
to
get
it
correct
'well
after
that
discovery
you
may
imagine
how
minutely
i
went
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
glass
in
search
of
further
light
of
course
i
did
not
neglect
the
inscription
on
the
scroll
of
zechariah--upon
one
stone
are
seven
eyes
but
i
very
quickly
concluded
that
this
must
refer
to
some
mark
on
a
stone
which
could
only
be
found
in
situ
where
the
treasure
was
concealed
to
be
short
i
made
all
possible
notes
and
sketches
and
tracings
and
then
came
back
to
parsbury
to
work
out
the
cipher
at
leisure
oh
the
agonies
i
went
through
i
thought
myself
very
clever
at
first
for
i
made
sure
that
the
key
would
be
found
in
some
of
the
old
books
on
secret
writing
the
steganographia
of
joachim
trithemius
who
was
an
earlier
contemporary
of
abbot
thomas
seemed
particularly
promising
so
i
got
that
and
selenius's
cryptographia
and
bacon's
de
augmentis
scientiarum
and
some
more
but
i
could
hit
upon
nothing
then
i
tried
the
principle
of
the
most
frequent
letter
taking
first
latin
and
then
german
as
a
basis
that
didn't
help
either
whether
it
ought
to
have
done
so
i
am
not
clear
and
then
i
came
back
to
the
window
itself
and
read
over
my
notes
hoping
almost
against
hope
that
the
abbot
might
himself
have
somewhere
supplied
the
key
i
wanted
i
could
make
nothing
out
of
the
colour
or
pattern
of
the
robes
there
were
no
landscape
backgrounds
with
subsidiary
objects
there
was
nothing
in
the
canopies
the
only
resource
possible
seemed
to
be
in

perhaps
the
placing
of
dots
after
the
three
last
letters
might
indicate
some
difference
of
procedure
then
i
thought
to
myself
wasn't
there
some
allusion
to
a
well
in
the
account
of
abbot
thomas
in
that
book
the
'sertum'
yes
there
was
he
built
a
puteus
in
atrio
a
well
in
the
court
there
of
course
was
my
word
atrio
the
next
step
was
to
copy
out
the
remaining
letters
of
the
inscription
omitting
those
i
had
already
used
that
gave
what
you
will
see
on
this
slip

vaimleatthoovmcahqe
'now
i
knew
what
the
three
first
letters
i
wanted
were--namely
rio--to
complete
the
word
atrio
and
as
you
will
see
these
are
all
to
be
found
in
the
first
five
letters
i
was
a
little
confused
at
first
by
the
occurrence
of
two
i's
but
very
soon
i
saw
that
every
alternate
letter
must
be
taken
in
the
remainder
of
the
inscription
you
can
work
it
out
for
yourself
the
result
continuing
where
the
first
round
left

'the
last
words
i
ought
to
say
are

device
which
abbot
thomas
had
adopted
i
found
it
with
his
arms
in
another
piece
of
glass
at
lord
d----'s
and
he
drafted
it
bodily
into
his
cipher
though
it
doesn't
quite
fit
in
point
of
grammar
'well
what
would
any
human
being
have
been
tempted
to
do
my
dear
gregory
in
my
place
could
he
have
helped
setting
off
as
i
did
to
steinfeld
and
tracing
the
secret
literally
to
the
fountain-head
i
don't
believe
he
could
anyhow
i
couldn't
and
as
i
needn't
tell
you
i
found
myself
at
steinfeld
as
soon
as
the
resources
of
civilization
could
put
me
there
and
installed
myself
in
the
inn
you
saw
i
must
tell
you
that
i
was
not
altogether
free
from
forebodings--on
one
hand
of
disappointment
on
the
other
of
danger
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
abbot
thomas's
well
might
have
been
wholly
obliterated
or
else
that
someone
ignorant
of
cryptograms
and
guided
only
by
luck
might
have
stumbled
on
the
treasure
before
me
and
then'--there
was
a
very
perceptible
shaking
of
the
voice
here--'i
was
not
entirely
easy
i
need
not
mind
confessing
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
words
about
the
guardian
of
the
treasure
but
if
you
don't
mind
i'll
say
no
more
about
that
until--until
it
becomes
necessary
'at
the
first
possible
opportunity
brown
and
i
began
exploring
the
place
i
had
naturally
represented
myself
as
being
interested
in
the
remains
of
the
abbey
and
we
could
not
avoid
paying
a
visit
to
the
church
impatient
as
i
was
to
be
elsewhere
still
it
did
interest
me
to
see
the
windows
where
the
glass
had
been
and
especially
that
at
the
east
end
of
the
south
aisle
in
the
tracery
lights
of
that
i
was
startled
to
see
some
fragments
and
coats-of-arms
remaining--abbot
thomas's
shield
was
there
and
a
small
figure
with
a
scroll
inscribed
oculos
habent
et
non
videbunt
they
have
eyes
and
shall
not
see
which
i
take
it
was
a
hit
of
the
abbot
at
his
canons
'but
of
course
the
principal
object
was
to
find
the
abbot's
house
there
is
no
prescribed
place
for
this
so
far
as
i
know
in
the
plan
of
a
monastery
you
can't
predict
of
it
as
you
can
of
the
chapter-house
that
it
will
be
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
cloister
or
as
of
the
dormitory
that
it
will
communicate
with
a
transept
of
the
church
i
felt
that
if
i
asked
many
questions
i
might
awaken
lingering
memories
of
the
treasure
and
i
thought
it
best
to
try
first
to
discover
it
for
myself
it
was
not
a
very
long
or
difficult
search
that
three-sided
court
south-east
of
the
church
with
deserted
piles
of
building
round
it
and
grass-grown
pavement
which
you
saw
this
morning
was
the
place
and
glad
enough
i
was
to
see
that
it
was
put
to
no
use
and
was
neither
very
far
from
our
inn
nor
overlooked
by
any
inhabited
building
there
were
only
orchards
and
paddocks
on
the
slopes
east
of
the
church
i
can
tell
you
that
fine
stone
glowed
wonderfully
in
the
rather
watery
yellow
sunset
that
we
had
on
the
tuesday
afternoon
'next
what
about
the
well
there
was
not
much
doubt
about
that
as
you
can
testify
it
is
really
a
very
remarkable
thing
that
curb
is
i
think
of
italian
marble
and
the
carving
i
thought
must
be
italian
also
there
were
reliefs
you
will
perhaps
remember
of
eliezer
and
rebekah
and
of
jacob
opening
the
well
for
rachel
and
similar
subjects
but
by
way
of
disarming
suspicion
i
suppose
the
abbot
had
carefully
abstained
from
any
of
his
cynical
and
allusive
inscriptions
'i
examined
the
whole
structure
with
the
keenest
interest
of
course--a
square
well-head
with
an
opening
in
one
side
an
arch
over
it
with
a
wheel
for
the
rope
to
pass
over
evidently
in
very
good
condition
still
for
it
had
been
used
within
sixty
years
or
perhaps
even
later
though
not
quite
recently
then
there
was
the
question
of
depth
and
access
to
the
interior
i
suppose
the
depth
was
about
sixty
to
seventy
feet
and
as
to
the
other
point
it
really
seemed
as
if
the
abbot
had
wished
to
lead
searchers
up
to
the
very
door
of
his
treasure-house
for
as
you
tested
for
yourself
there
were
big
blocks
of
stone
bonded
into
the
masonry
and
leading
down
in
a
regular
staircase
round
and
round
the
inside
of
the
well
'it
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
true
i
wondered
if
there
was
a
trap--if
the
stones
were
so
contrived
as
to
tip
over
when
a
weight
was
placed
on
them
but
i
tried
a
good
many
with
my
own
weight
and
with
my
stick
and
all
seemed
and
actually
were
perfectly
firm
of
course
i
resolved
that
brown
and
i
would
make
an
experiment
that
very
night
'i
was
well
prepared
knowing
the
sort
of
place
i
should
have
to
explore
i
had
brought
a
sufficiency
of
good
rope
and
bands
of
webbing
to
surround
my
body
and
cross-bars
to
hold
to
as
well
as
lanterns
and
candles
and
crowbars
all
of
which
would
go
into
a
single
carpet-bag
and
excite
no
suspicion
i
satisfied
myself
that
my
rope
would
be
long
enough
and
that
the
wheel
for
the
bucket
was
in
good
working
order
and
then
we
went
home
to
dinner
'i
had
a
little
cautious
conversation
with
the
landlord
and
made
out
that
he
would
not
be
overmuch
surprised
if
i
went
out
for
a
stroll
with
my
man
about
nine
o'clock
to
make
heaven
forgive
me
a
sketch
of
the
abbey
by
moonlight
i
asked
no
questions
about
the
well
and
am
not
likely
to
do
so
now
i
fancy
i
know
as
much
about
it
as
anyone
in
steinfeld
at
least'--with
a
strong
shudder--'i
don't
want
to
know
any
more
'now
we
come
to
the
crisis
and
though
i
hate
to
think
of
it
i
feel
sure
gregory
that
it
will
be
better
for
me
in
all
ways
to
recall
it
just
as
it
happened
we
started
brown
and
i
at
about
nine
with
our
bag
and
attracted
no
attention
for
we
managed
to
slip
out
at
the
hinder
end
of
the
inn-yard
into
an
alley
which
brought
us
quite
to
the
edge
of
the
village
in
five
minutes
we
were
at
the
well
and
for
some
little
time
we
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
well-head
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
stirring
or
spying
on
us
all
we
heard
was
some
horses
cropping
grass
out
of
sight
farther
down
the
eastern
slope
we
were
perfectly
unobserved
and
had
plenty
of
light
from
the
gorgeous
full
moon
to
allow
us
to
get
the
rope
properly
fitted
over
the
wheel
then
i
secured
the
band
round
my
body
beneath
the
arms
we
attached
the
end
of
the
rope
very
securely
to
a
ring
in
the
stonework
brown
took
the
lighted
lantern
and
followed
me
i
had
a
crowbar
and
so
we
began
to
descend
cautiously
feeling
every
step
before
we
set
foot
on
it
and
scanning
the
walls
in
search
of
any
marked
stone
'half
aloud
i
counted
the
steps
as
we
went
down
and
we
got
as
far
as
the
thirty-eighth
before
i
noted
anything
at
all
irregular
in
the
surface
of
the
masonry
even
here
there
was
no
mark
and
i
began
to
feel
very
blank
and
to
wonder
if
the
abbot's
cryptogram
could
possibly
be
an
elaborate
hoax
at
the
forty-ninth
step
the
staircase
ceased
it
was
with
a
very
sinking
heart
that
i
began
retracing
my
steps
and
when
i
was
back
on
the
thirty-eighth--brown
with
the
lantern
being
a
step
or
two
above
me--i
scrutinized
the
little
bit
of
irregularity
in
the
stonework
with
all
my
might
but
there
was
no
vestige
of
a
mark
'then
it
struck
me
that
the
texture
of
the
surface
looked
just
a
little
smoother
than
the
rest
or
at
least
in
some
way
different
it
might
possibly
be
cement
and
not
stone
i
gave
it
a
good
blow
with
my
iron
bar
there
was
a
decidedly
hollow
sound
though
that
might
be
the
result
of
our
being
in
a
well
but
there
was
more
a
great
flake
of
cement
dropped
on
to
my
feet
and
i
saw
marks
on
the
stone
underneath
i
had
tracked
the
abbot
down
my
dear
gregory
even
now
i
think
of
it
with
a
certain
pride
it
took
but
a
very
few
more
taps
to
clear
the
whole
of
the
cement
away
and
i
saw
a
slab
of
stone
about
two
feet
square
upon
which
was
engraven
a
cross
disappointment
again
but
only
for
a
moment
it
was
you
brown
who
reassured
me
by
a
casual
remark
you
said
if
i
remember
right
'it's
a
funny
cross
looks
like
a
lot
of
eyes
'i
snatched
the
lantern
out
of
your
hand
and
saw
with
inexpressible
pleasure
that
the
cross
was
composed
of
seven
eyes
four
in
a
vertical
line
three
horizontal
the
last
of
the
scrolls
in
the
window
was
explained
in
the
way
i
had
anticipated
here
was
my
stone
with
the
seven
eyes
so
far
the
abbot's
data
had
been
exact
and
as
i
thought
of
this
the
anxiety
about
the
guardian
returned
upon
me
with
increased
force
still
i
wasn't
going
to
retreat
now
'without
giving
myself
time
to
think
i
knocked
away
the
cement
all
round
the
marked
stone
and
then
gave
it
a
prise
on
the
right
side
with
my
crowbar
it
moved
at
once
and
i
saw
that
it
was
but
a
thin
light
slab
such
as
i
could
easily
lift
out
myself
and
that
it
stopped
the
entrance
to
a
cavity
i
did
lift
it
out
unbroken
and
set
it
on
the
step
for
it
might
be
very
important
to
us
to
be
able
to
replace
it
then
i
waited
for
several
minutes
on
the
step
just
above
i
don't
know
why
but
i
think
to
see
if
any
dreadful
thing
would
rush
out
nothing
happened
next
i
lit
a
candle
and
very
cautiously
i
placed
it
inside
the
cavity
with
some
idea
of
seeing
whether
there
were
foul
air
and
of
getting
a
glimpse
of
what
was
inside
there
was
some
foulness
of
air
which
nearly
extinguished
the
flame
but
in
no
long
time
it
burned
quite
steadily
the
hole
went
some
little
way
back
and
also
on
the
right
and
left
of
the
entrance
and
i
could
see
some
rounded
light-coloured
objects
within
which
might
be
bags
there
was
no
use
in
waiting
i
faced
the
cavity
and
looked
in
there
was
nothing
immediately
in
the
front
of
the
hole
i
put
my
arm
in
and
felt
to
the
right
very
gingerly
'just
give
me
a
glass
of
cognac
brown
i'll
go
on
in
a
moment
gregory
'well
i
felt
to
the
right
and
my
fingers
touched
something
curved
that
felt--yes--more
or
less
like
leather
dampish
it
was
and
evidently
part
of
a
heavy
full
thing
there
was
nothing
i
must
say
to
alarm
one
i
grew
bolder
and
putting
both
hands
in
as
well
as
i
could
i
pulled
it
to
me
and
it
came
it
was
heavy
but
moved
more
easily
than
i
had
expected
as
i
pulled
it
towards
the
entrance
my
left
elbow
knocked
over
and
extinguished
the
candle
i
got
the
thing
fairly
in
front
of
the
mouth
and
began
drawing
it
out
just
then
brown
gave
a
sharp
ejaculation
and
ran
quickly
up
the
steps
with
the
lantern
he
will
tell
you
why
in
a
moment
startled
as
i
was
i
looked
round
after
him
and
saw
him
stand
for
a
minute
at
the
top
and
then
walk
away
a
few
yards
then
i
heard
him
call
softly
all
right
sir
and
went
on
pulling
out
the
great
bag
in
complete
darkness
it
hung
for
an
instant
on
the
edge
of
the
hole
then
slipped
forward
on
to
my
chest
and
put
its
arms
round
my
neck
'my
dear
gregory
i
am
telling
you
the
exact
truth
i
believe
i
am
now
acquainted
with
the
extremity
of
terror
and
repulsion
which
a
man
can
endure
without
losing
his
mind
i
can
only
just
manage
to
tell
you
now
the
bare
outline
of
the
experience
i
was
conscious
of
a
most
horrible
smell
of
mould
and
of
a
cold
kind
of
face
pressed
against
my
own
and
moving
slowly
over
it
and
of
several--i
don't
know
how
many--legs
or
arms
or
tentacles
or
something
clinging
to
my
body
i
screamed
out
brown
says
like
a
beast
and
fell
away
backward
from
the
step
on
which
i
stood
and
the
creature
slipped
downwards
i
suppose
on
to
that
same
step
providentially
the
band
round
me
held
firm
brown
did
not
lose
his
head
and
was
strong
enough
to
pull
me
up
to
the
top
and
get
me
over
the
edge
quite
promptly
how
he
managed
it
exactly
i
don't
know
and
i
think
he
would
find
it
hard
to
tell
you
i
believe
he
contrived
to
hide
our
implements
in
the
deserted
building
near
by
and
with
very
great
difficulty
he
got
me
back
to
the
inn
i
was
in
no
state
to
make
explanations
and
brown
knows
no
german
but
next
morning
i
told
the
people
some
tale
of
having
had
a
bad
fall
in
the
abbey
ruins
which
i
suppose
they
believed
and
now
before
i
go
further
i
should
just
like
you
to
hear
what
brown's
experiences
during
those
few
minutes
were
tell
the
rector
brown
what
you
told
me'
'well
sir'
said
brown
speaking
low
and
nervously
'it
was
just
this
way
master
was
busy
down
in
front
of
the
'ole
and
i
was
'olding
the
lantern
and
looking
on
when
i
'eard
somethink
drop
in
the
water
from
the
top
as
i
thought
so
i
looked
up
and
i
see
someone's
'ead
lookin'
over
at
us
i
s'pose
i
must
ha'
said
somethink
and
i
'eld
the
light
up
and
run
up
the
steps
and
my
light
shone
right
on
the
face
that
was
a
bad
un
sir
if
ever
i
see
one
a
holdish
man
and
the
face
very
much
fell
in
and
larfin'
as
i
thought
and
i
got
up
the
steps
as
quick
pretty
nigh
as
i'm
tellin'
you
and
when
i
was
out
on
the
ground
there
warn't
a
sign
of
any
person
there
'adn't
been
the
time
for
anyone
to
get
away
let
alone
a
hold
chap
and
i
made
sure
he
warn't
crouching
down
by
the
well
nor
nothink
next
thing
i
hear
master
cry
out
somethink
'orrible
and
hall
i
see
was
him
hanging
out
by
the
rope
and
as
master
says
'owever
i
got
him
up
i
couldn't
tell
you'
'you
hear
that
gregory'
said
mr
somerton
'now
does
any
explanation
of
that
incident
strike
you'
'the
whole
thing
is
so
ghastly
and
abnormal
that
i
must
own
it
puts
me
quite
off
my
balance
but
the
thought
did
occur
to
me
that
possibly
the--well
the
person
who
set
the
trap
might
have
come
to
see
the
success
of
his
plan'
'just
so
gregory
just
so
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
so--likely
i
should
say
if
such
a
word
had
a
place
anywhere
in
my
story
i
think
it
must
have
been
the
abbot
well
i
haven't
much
more
to
tell
you
i
spent
a
miserable
night
brown
sitting
up
with
me
next
day
i
was
no
better
unable
to
get
up
no
doctor
to
be
had
and
if
one
had
been
available
i
doubt
if
he
could
have
done
much
for
me
i
made
brown
write
off
to
you
and
spent
a
second
terrible
night
and
gregory
of
this
i
am
sure
and
i
think
it
affected
me
more
than
the
first
shock
for
it
lasted
longer
there
was
someone
or
something
on
the
watch
outside
my
door
the
whole
night
i
almost
fancy
there
were
two
it
wasn't
only
the
faint
noises
i
heard
from
time
to
time
all
through
the
dark
hours
but
there
was
the
smell--the
hideous
smell
of
mould
every
rag
i
had
had
on
me
on
that
first
evening
i
had
stripped
off
and
made
brown
take
it
away
i
believe
he
stuffed
the
things
into
the
stove
in
his
room
and
yet
the
smell
was
there
as
intense
as
it
had
been
in
the
well
and
what
is
more
it
came
from
outside
the
door
but
with
the
first
glimmer
of
dawn
it
faded
out
and
the
sounds
ceased
too
and
that
convinced
me
that
the
thing
or
things
were
creatures
of
darkness
and
could
not
stand
the
daylight
and
so
i
was
sure
that
if
anyone
could
put
back
the
stone
it
or
they
would
be
powerless
until
someone
else
took
it
away
again
i
had
to
wait
until
you
came
to
get
that
done
of
course
i
couldn't
send
brown
to
do
it
by
himself
and
still
less
could
i
tell
anyone
who
belonged
to
the
place
'well
there
is
my
story
and
if
you
don't
believe
it
i
can't
help
it
but
i
think
you
do'
'indeed'
said
mr
gregory
'i
can
find
no
alternative
i
must
believe
it
i
saw
the
well
and
the
stone
myself
and
had
a
glimpse
i
thought
of
the
bags
or
something
else
in
the
hole
and
to
be
plain
with
you
somerton
i
believe
my
door
was
watched
last
night
too'
'i
dare
say
it
was
gregory
but
thank
goodness
that
is
over
have
you
by
the
way
anything
to
tell
about
your
visit
to
that
dreadful
place'
'very
little'
was
the
answer
'brown
and
i
managed
easily
enough
to
get
the
slab
into
its
place
and
he
fixed
it
very
firmly
with
the
irons
and
wedges
you
had
desired
him
to
get
and
we
contrived
to
smear
the
surface
with
mud
so
that
it
looks
just
like
the
rest
of
the
wall
one
thing
i
did
notice
in
the
carving
on
the
well-head
which
i
think
must
have
escaped
you
it
was
a
horrid
grotesque
shape--perhaps
more
like
a
toad
than
anything
else
and
there
was
a
label
by
it
inscribed
with
the
two
words
depositum
custodi'9
9
'keep
that
which
is
committed
to
thee'
