a
heavy
stillness
hung
about
the
great
halls
and
richly
furnished
rooms
of
judson
mcmasters'
residence
and
even
seemed
to
extend
out
over
the
velvet
lawns
the
shrub-lined
walks
and
sun-blotched
reaches
under
the
lacy
elms
and
somber
maples
biggs
glided
about
the
sick-chamber
like
a
specter
apparently
striving
to
keep
busy
while
he
cast
countless
furtive
uneasy
glances
at
the
heavy
figure
under
the
white
sheets
an
odor
of
drugs
and
fever
tainted
the
air
and
a
small
walnut
table
near
the
flushed
sleeper
was
laden
with
the
familiar
prescription
bottle
tumbler
and
box
of
powders
on
the
wall
behind
the
table
near
the
head
of
the
bed
hung
a
small
oil-painting
of
napoleon
the
sleeper
stirred
restlessly
raised
himself
painfully
and
slowly
and
attempted
to
seek
fleeting
comfort
in
a
new
position
at
the
first
movement
biggs
was
a
shadow
at
the
bedside
deftly
manipulating
the
coverings
and
gently
aiding
the
sick
man
with
a
tenderness
born
of
long
service
and
deep
affection
as
the
massive
gray
head
sank
into
the
fluffed
pillow
the
tired
eyes
opened
lighted
by
a
faint
glint
of
thankfulness
then
they
closed
again
and
the
once
powerful
body
relaxed
with
a
pitiful
wistful
expression
on
his
aged
face
the
faithful
biggs
stood
helplessly
peering
at
the
sick
man
until
hot
tears
began
to
course
down
his
furrowed
cheeks
and
he
turned
hastily
away
biggs
the
voice
still
strong
and
commanding
cut
the
semi-gloom
like
a
knife
biggs
who
was
about
to
tuck
the
heavy
curtains
still
more
securely
over
the
windows
whirled
as
though
he
had
touched
a
live
wire
and
in
a
flash
was
across
the
great
room
and
beside
the
bed
did
you
call
sir
his
voice
quavered
no--a
faint
twinkle
lighted
the
sick
man's
eyes--i
just
spoke
ah
now
sir
cried
the
overjoyed
biggs
you
are
better
sir
biggs
i
want
some
air
and
sunshine
but
the
doctor
sir----
drat
the
doctor
if
i'm
going
to
pass
out
i
want
to
see
where
i'm
going
oh
but
sir
expostulated
the
old
servant
as
he
parted
the
curtains
and
partially
opened
a
casement
window
i
wish
you
wouldn't
say
that
sir
i
believe
in
facing
a
situation
squarely
biggs
my
father
and
grandfather
died
from
this
family
malady
and
i
guess
i'm
headed
over
the
same
route
please
sir
entreated
biggs
biggs
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
yes
sir
are
you
a
christian
i
try
to
be
sir
do
you
believe
in
death
biggs
was
thoroughly
startled
and
confused
why--a--we
all
have
to
die
sometime
sir
he
answered
haltingly
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
but
do
we
actually
die
insisted
the
sufferer
well
i
hope--not
yet
ventured
the
old
servant
the
doctor
said----
forget
the
doctor
interposed
mcmasters
biggs
you
have
been
in
our
service
since
i
was
a
lad
haven't
you
tears
welled
into
the
servant's
eyes
and
his
voice
faltered
fifty-six
years
come
next
november
he
answered
well
let
me
tell
you
something
that
even
in
those
fifty-six
years
you
never
learned
biggs
my
grandfather
was
buried
alive
oh
sir
impossible
cried
biggs
in
horror
absolutely
asserted
the
banker
why--are
you--how
do
you
know
sir
in
a
hoarse
whisper
my
father
built
a
family
mausoleum
in
the
far
corner
of
this
estate
didn't
he
yes
sir--he
hated
burial
in
the
earth
sir
after
reading
a
poem
of
edgar
allan
poe's
sir
what
poem
was
that
biggs
i
don't
recall
the
name
of
it
but
i
remember
the
line
faltered
biggs
what
was
it
oh
sir
cried
the
old
man
let's
talk
about
something
cheerful
not
until
we're
through
with
this
discussion
hiram





the
sound
of
his
given
name
restored
biggs
somewhat
for
the
banker
resorted
to
it
only
on
occasions
when
he
shared
his
deepest
confidences
with
his
old
houseman
well
the
line
goes
'soft
may
the
worms
about
him
creep'
sir
a
slight
shudder
seemed
to
run
through
mcmasters'
body
then
after
a
tomb-like
silence
good
reason
for
building
the
mausoleum
yes
sir
i
think
so
sir
well
with
an
apparent
effort
when
they
exhumed
my
grandfather's
remains
to
place
them
in
the
new
vault
the
casket
was
opened
and----
oh
sir
cried
biggs
throwing
out
a
trembling
expostulating
hand
but
the
banker
went
on
relentlessly
----the
body
was
turned
over
on
its
side
with
the
left
knee
drawn
up
part-way
that's
the
way
he
always
slept--in
life
biggs'
voice
was
a
hollow
whisper
and
that's
the
reason
my
father
after
building
himself
a
mausoleum
insisted
that
his
body
be
cremated
said
mcmasters
he
took
no
chances
biggs'
horrified
eyes
traveled
dully
to
the
massive
urn
over
the
great
fireplace
and
rested
there
fascinated
hiram
where
is
heaven
biggs'
eyes
flitted
back
to
rest
in
surprize
upon
the
questioner
why
up
there
sir
pointing
toward
the
ceiling
do
you
believe
that
the
earth
rotates
on
its
axis
that's
what
i
was
taught
in
school
sir
if
that
hypothesis
is
true
we
are
rolling
through
space
at
the
rate
of
about
sixteen
miles
a
minute
figured
the
banker
now
you
say
heaven
is
up
there
yes
sir
biggs
what
time
is
it
the
servant
glanced
at
the
great
clock
in
the
corner
ah
it's
twelve
o'clock
sir
and
time
for
your
medicine
in
a
voice
full
of
relief
never
mind
the
drugs
commanded
mcmasters
until
we
finish
our
problem
in
higher
mathematics
now
if
i
ask
you
where
heaven
is
at
midnight
which
will
be
twelve
hours
from
now
where
will
you
point
triumphantly
why
up
there
replied
the
bewildered
servant
again
indicating
the
ceiling
then
cried
mcmasters
you
will
be
pointing
directly
opposite
from
the
place
you
indicated
a
moment
ago
for
by
midnight
the
earth
will
have
turned
approximately
upside
down
do
you
get
my
point
yes
sir
replied
poor
biggs
thoroughly
befuddled
then
where
will
heaven
be
at
six
o'clock
this
evening
fairly
shouted
the
sick
man
out
there
replied
the
servant
hopelessly
pointing
toward
the
window
and
where
will
heaven
be
at
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
over
there
and
biggs
pointed
a
trembling
finger
at
the
fireplace
then
oh
sir
let's
not--the
doctor----
hang
the
doctor
interrupted
mcmasters
testily
i've
been
thinking
this
thing
over
and
i've
got
to
talk
about
it
to
someone
but
don't
you
believe
in
a
hereafter
queried
biggs
a
horrible
note
of
fear
in
his
pitiful
voice
for
a
moment
the
banker
was
silent
the
massive
clock
ticked
solemnly
on
a
coal
toppled
with
a
sputter
and
flare
in
the
fireplace
yes
hiram
in
a
thoughtful
voice
i
suppose
i
do
i'm
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
cried
biggs
in
very
evident
relief
ah
if
you
could
but
tell
me
continued
the
banker
from
whence
we
come
and
whither
we
go
if
i
knew
sir
i'd
be
equal
with
the
creator
answered
biggs
with
reverence
that's
well
said
hiram
but
it
doesn't
satisfy
me
i've
made
my
place
in
the
world
by
getting
to
the
root
of
things
ah
if
i
could
only
get
a
peek
behind
the
curtain
before
i
go--back-stage
you
know--mayhap
i
would
not
be
afraid
to
die
and
his
voice
fell
almost
to
a
whisper
the
great
director
does
not
permit
the
audience
behind
the
footlights
unless
he
calls
them
answered
biggs
whimsically
the
ghost
of
a
smile
lighting
up
his
troubled
features
another
thing
biggs
do
you
believe
those
stories
about
jonah
and
lazarus
and
the
fellow
they
let
down
through
a
hole
in
the
roof
to
be
healed
i
do
sir
with
conviction
do
you
understand
how
it
was
done
testily
of
course
not
sir
being
only
a
human
then
tell
me
hiram
when
you
cannot
see
through
it
how
can
you
swallow
all
this
theology
my
faith
sir
answered
biggs
simply
raising
his
eyes
with
reverence
at
this
a
quizzical
smile
came
over
the
sick
man's
face
in
looking
up
hiram
don't
forget
since
it
is
twelve-thirty
that
we
have
swung
around
four
hundred
and
eighty
miles
from
the
spot
you
originally
designated
as
the
location
of
the
pearly
gates
oh
sir
i
beg
of
you
remonstrated
the
servant
i
cannot
bear
to
have
you
jest
on
such
a--why
master
he
broke
off
with
a
little
cry
rushing
to
his
bedside
the
quizzical
smile
on
the
banker's
face
had
suddenly
faded
and
his
head
had
fallen
feebly
back
upon
the
pillow
oh
why
did
he
waste
his
strength
so
cried
biggs
piteously
as
with
trembling
hands
and
tear-blurred
eyes
he
searched
the
little
table
for
the
smelling-salts
after
a
few
breaths
the
patient
sighed
and
opened
his
eyes
wearily
my
medicine
hiram
and
then
i
must
rest





at
midnight
biggs
dozing
in
a
big
chair
by
the
fire
was
aroused
by
a
voice
from
the
sick
bed
hiram
yes
sir
scurrying
to
turn
on
a
subdued
light
where
is
heaven
now
noting
the
wan
flicker
of
a
smile
the
old
servant
pointed
solemnly
downward
you
are
a
bright
pupil
came
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
thank
you
sir
do
you
know
biggs
i
wish
i
had
led
a
different--a
better
life
you
have
been
a
good
master
sir
you
have
been
kind
you
have
given
liberally
to
charity
biggs
defended
him
yes
cynically
i
have
given
liberally
to
charity
but
it
has
been
no
sacrifice
you
have
been
a
pillar
in
the
church
ventured
biggs
yes
bitterly
a
stone
pillar
i
have
paid
handsomely
for
my
pew
and
slept
peacefully
through
the
sermons
i
have
bought
baskets
of
food
for
the
poor
at
thanksgiving
and
christmas
time
only
to
let
others
reap
the
happiness
of
giving
them
away
i
could
have
had
so
much
joy
out
of
christmas
if
i
would
i
could
have
been
a
jolly
rosy-cheeked
santa
claus
and
gone
to
a
hundred
homes
my
arms
loaded
with
gifts
true
sir
but
you
made
that
joy
possible
for
others
when
i
should
have
known
the
thrill
of
it
myself
i
have
not
really
lived
hiram
to
draw
the
sweets
truly
out
of
life
one
must
humble
himself
and
serve
his
fellow
men
yes
the
scales
have
fallen
from
my
eyes
hiram
but
it
is
too
late
'the
spirit
is
willing
but
the
flesh
is
weak'
it
doesn't
seem
right
sir
said
biggs
after
a
pause
what's
that
hiram
why
sir
that
you
should
be
stricken
down
in
the
prime
of
life
just
at
a
time
when
you
could
mean
so
much
to
others
while
i
old
and
useless
am
permitted
to
live
on
but
i
am
not
finding
fault
with
providence
sir
biggs
hastened
to
say
i
just
can't
find
the
meaning
of
the
riddle
sir
probably
i've
had
my
chance
and
fumbled
it
biggs
even
so
sir
god
is
not
vindictive
according
to
my
ideas
there
surely
is
some
other
solution
i'm
still
going
to
pray
that
he
will
take
me
in
your
stead
even
if
a
miracle
must
be
performed
so
you
have
faith
in
your
prayers
do
you
biggs
yes
sir
if
they
are
unselfish
prayers
that
brand
is
rather
scarce
i
take
it
answered
mcmasters
but
his
tone
was
reflective
rather
than
sarcastic
oh
sir
i
wish
you
would
pray
as
i
do
god
would
surely
understand
rather
a
queer
request
hiram
if
my
life
depends
upon
your
death
no
prayer
shall
ever
pass
my
lips
but
sir
i'm
an
old----
however
interrupted
mcmasters
i
shall
pray
that
if
my
life
is
spared
in
any
other
fashion
i
will
make
full
amends
for
my
years
of
indifference
and
neglect
and
hiram
no
one
knows
how
much
i
truly
seek
this
divine
dispensation
but
i
have
always
scoffed
at
death-bed
confessions
and
so
my
heart
grows
cold
for
i
have
no
right
to
ask--now
again
wearily
no
right--now
ah
master
god
is
plenteous
in
mercy
if
you
but
have
the
faith
sir
it
shall
make
you
whole
very
good
had
i
lived
as
you
have
lived
biggs
then
after
a
pause
still
the
cause
is
worthy
my
heart
is
right
and
i
shall
approach
the
throne
may
god
be
merciful
unto
me
a
sinner
i
hope
it
is
not
too
late
yet
faltered
biggs
oh
if
god
would
only
call
me
in
your
stead
that
you
might
still
do
the
good
work
that
you
find
it
in
your
heart
to
do
how
gladly
would
i
go
a
deep
sigh
was
his
only
answer





a
long
silence
was
finally
broken
by
the
sick
man
but
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
so
strange
and
uncanny
that
the
servant
hastened
close
and
peered
anxiously
into
the
fever-flushed
face
of
the
sufferer
hiram--i
must
tell
you--a
secret
came
in
a
laborious
almost
sepulchral
whisper
biggs
came
closer
bring
a
chair
and
sit
down
i
must
talk
to
you
as
the
old
servant
again
leaned
forward
the
sufferer
hesitated
then
with
an
obvious
effort
he
began
hiram
i
am
going
to
give
you
some
instructions
which
you
must
obey
to
the
letter
will
you
promise
to
keep
them
i
swear
it
sir
with
great
earnestness
good
now
if
this
fever
seals
my
lips
and
the
doctor
pronounces
me
dead----
please
sir
biggs
broke
in
tears
streaming
down
his
furrowed
cheeks
but
his
master
continued
in
the
same
subdued
voice
whatever
happens
i
am
not
to
be
embalmed--do
you
hear
me--not
embalmed
but
just
laid
away
as
i
am
now
yes
sir
in
a
choked
voice
which
fully
betrayed
the
breaking
heart
behind
it
and
now
hiram
the
rest
of
the
secret
he
paused
and
beckoned
biggs
to
lean
closer
in
my
vault--in
the
mausoleum
i
have
had
an
electric
button
installed
that
button
connects
with
a
silver
bell
lift
up
that
small
picture
of
napoleon
there
upon
the
wall
his
hands
trembling
as
with
the
palsy
biggs
reached
out
and
lifted
aside
the
picture
hanging
near
the
head
of
the
bed
and
there
revealed
the
silver
bell
fitted
into
a
small
aperture
in
the
wall
then
with
a
sob
he
fell
back
into
his
chair
hiram--in
a
whisper--after
they
bury
me
you
are
to
sleep
in
this
bed
with
a
cry
the
old
man
threw
out
a
horrified
expostulating
hand
catching
it
feverishly
the
banker
half
raised
himself
in
bed
don't
you
understand
he
cried
fiercely
i
may
not
be
dead
after
all
remember
grandfather
and
biggs--if
that
bell
rings
get
help--quick
suddenly
releasing
his
hold
mcmasters
fell
back
limply
among
the
pillows





all
through
the
long
night
the
faithful
biggs
maintained
a
sleepless
vigil
but
the
banker
lay
as
immovable
as
a
stone
when
the
rosy-cheeked
dawn
came
peeping
audaciously
through
the
casements
biggs
drew
the
heavy
curtains
tightly
shut
once
more
not
until
the
doctor's
motor
whirled
away
did
the
patient
rouse
from
his
lethargy
apparently
strengthened
by
his
deep
stupor
he
spoke
and
biggs
stood
instantly
beside
him
what
did
the
doctor
say
biggs
hesitated
out
with
it
i'm
no
chicken-hearted
weakling
nothing
much
admitted
biggs
sadly
he
only
shook
his
head
very
gravely
he
doesn't
understand
this
family
malady
any
more
than
the
old
quack
who
allowed
my
grandfather
to
be
buried
alive
said
mcmasters
almost
fiercely
biggs
shuddered
and
put
a
trembling
hand
to
his
eyes
what
ails
me
biggs
almost
plaintively
no
one
knows
this
fever
has
baffled
the
scientists
for
years
when
you
fall
into
a
comatose
condition
they
call
it
suspended
animation
that's
the
best
thing
they
do--find
names
for
diseases
my
family
doctor
doesn't
have
any
more
of
an
idea
about
this
malady
than
you
or
i
the
average
physician
is
just
a
guesser
he
guesses
you
have
a
fever
and
prescribes
a
remedy
hoping
that
it
will
hit
the
spot
if
it
doesn't
he
looks
wise
wags
his
head--and
tries
something
else
on
you
maybe
it
works
and
maybe
it
doesn't
the
only
thing
my
guesser
is
absolutely
sure
of
is
that
if
i
live
or
if
i
die
he
will
collect
a
princely
fee
for
his
services
biggs
remained
statuesque
during
the
pause
gad
mcmasters
broke
out
again
testily
if
i
fiddled
around
in
my
business
like
that
i'd
be
a
pauper
in
a
month
but
the
doctor
says
you're
coming
on
ventured
biggs
sure
he
does
answered
the
banker
with
a
sneer
that's
his
stock
in
trade
i
know
that
line
of
palaver
secretly
he
knows
i
am
as
liable
to
be
dead
as
alive
when
he
comes
again
oh
sir
you
aren't
going
to
die
that's
what
i'm
afraid
of
biggs
but
they'll
call
me
dead
and
go
ahead
and
embalm
me
and
make
sure
of
it
oh
sir
i
wish----
now
remember
biggs
broke
in
the
sick
man
shoot
the
first
undertaker
that
tries
to
put
that
mummy
stuff
in
my
veins
i
understand
perfectly
sir
answered
biggs
fearful
lest
the
other's
excitement
might
again
give
him
a
turn
for
the
worse
i
know
i'm
apparently
going
to
pass
away
my
father
and
grandfather
both
had
this
cussed
virus
in
their
veins
and
i
don't
believe
either
of
them
was
dead
when
he
was
pronounced
so
well
if
by
any
chance--that
is
if
you
began
biggs
desperately
if
you
are
apparently--dead--why
not
have
them
keep
your
body
here
in
the
house
for
a
time
convention
formality
custom
hide-bound
law
the
banker
fairly
frothed
the
health
authorities
would
come
here
with
an
army
and
see
that
i
was
buried
no
biggs
i've
got
a
fine
crypt
out
there
all
quiet
and
secure
good
ventilation
electric
lights
like
a
pullman
berth--and
a
push-button
that
precludes
all
notoriety
it's
secret
and
safe
the
electrician
who
installed
the
apparatus
died
four
years
ago
so
you
and
i
alone
possess
this
knowledge
don't
you
think
someone
else
should
know
of
it
too
your
attorney
or----
no
biggs
if
i
really
am
dead
i
don't
want
anyone
to
write
up
my
eccentricities
for
some
sunday
magazine
sheet
and
if
i
do
come
back
then
it
will
be
time
to
tell
the
gaping
public
about
my
cleverness
i
wish
you
weren't
so--so
cold-blooded
about
it
all
sir
i
have
always
hit
straight
from
the
shoulder
hiram
and
i'm
facing
this
death
business
as
i'd
face
any
other
proposition
i'm
not
ready
to
cash
in
and
if
i
can
cheat
the
doctors
undertakers
lawyers
heirs
and
chief
mourners
for
a
few
more
years
i'm
going
to
do
it
and
don't
forget
poor
old
granddad
he
might
have
been
up
and
about
yet
had
he
but
used
my
scheme





biggs
turned
away
sick
at
heart
it
was
too
terrible
beyond
words
to
him
his
religion
was
as
essential
as
daily
bread
death
was
the
culmination
of
cherished
belief
and
constant
prayer
as
his
years
declined
he
had
faced
the
inevitable
day
with
simple
faith
that
when
the
summons
came
he
would
go
gladly
like
him
who
wraps
the
drapery
of
his
couch
about
him
and
lies
down
to
pleasant
dreams
with
throbbing
heart
he
listened
for
another
torrent
of
words
that
would
still
further
stab
his
sensitive
soul
for
he
had
loved
and
revered
his
master
from
his
youth
up
but
no
words
came
he
wheeled
about
the
massive
head
had
fallen
limply
among
the
pillows
pallid
lips
were
trying
to
form
sentences
without
result
then
the
great
body
seemed
to
subside
immeasurably
deeper
into
the
covers
and
a
death-like
stillness
fell
upon
the
room
intuitively
feeling
that
his
master
was
worse
than
at
any
previous
relapse
biggs
made
every
effort
to
revive
him
gently
at
first
and
then
by
vigorously
shaking
and
calling
to
him
in
a
heart-broken
piteous
voice
but
to
no
avail
the
heavy
figure
looked
pallid
and
corpse-like
under
the
snowy
sheets
long
hours
dragged
by
and
still
the
lonely
old
servant
sat
mutely
beside
the
bed
only
aroused
at
last
by
the
peremptory
measured
call
of
the
telephone
bell
yes
said
biggs
in
a
quavering
voice
oh
yes
doctor
meredith
master's
resting
easy
don't
think
you'll
need
to
come
until
tomorrow
i'll
keep
them
away
as
long
as
i
can
he
muttered
as
he
slipped
back
to
his
vigil
god
grant--maybe
he'll
come
back--and
take
up
the
work
of
the
master
so
long
delayed
oh
god
if
thou
wouldst
only
take
me
in
his
stead
sleeping
fitfully
biggs
sat
dumbly
through
an
interminable
night
but
the
new
day
brought
no
reassuring
sign
from
the
inert
form
the
stillness
was
appalling
the
other
servants
were
quartered
in
a
distant
part
of
the
mansion
and
only
came
when
summoned
again
biggs
assured
the
physician
that
he
could
gain
nothing
by
calling
and
another
awful
night
found
him
ashen
and
distraught
at
the
bedside
sometime
in
the
still
watches
he
swooned
and
kindly
nature
patched
up
his
shredded
nerves
before
consciousness
once
more
aroused
him
but
the
strain
was
more
than
he
could
bear
so
when
the
anxious
specialist
came
unbidden
he
found
a
shattered
old
watchman
who
broke
down
completely
and
babbled
forth
the
whole
mysterious
tale
concealing
nothing
but
the
secret
of
the
tomb
in
a
coffin
previously
made
to
order
they
laid
the
unembalmed
remains
of
judson
mcmasters
in
the
family
mausoleum
and
the
world
which
had
felt
his
masterful
presence
for
so
many
years
paused
long
enough
to
lay
a
costly
tribute
on
his
bier
and
then
went
smoothly
on
its
way
not
so
with
the
faithful
biggs
ensconced
in
his
master's
bedroom
he
nightly
tossed
in
troubled
sleep
filled
with
the
jangling
of
innumerable
electric
bells
and
when--on
the
tenth
night
after
he
had
been
somewhat
reassured
that
all
was
well--he
was
suddenly
awakened
by
a
mad
incessant
ringing
from
the
hidden
alarm
a
deathly
weakness
overcame
him
and
it
was
some
time
before
he
was
able
to
drag
his
palsied
body
from
the
bed
with
fumbling
clumsy
fingers
he
tried
to
hasten
but
it
was
many
minutes
before
he
tottered
half
dressed
out
of
the
room
and
as
he
did
so
his
heart
almost
stood
still
then
mounted
to
his
throat
as
if
to
choke
him
biggs--a
voice--mcmaster's
voice
was
calling
he
staggered
to
the
head
of
the
wide
massive
stairway
and
looked
down
there
stood
the
banker
pale
emaciated
but
smiling
and
then
as
from
an
endless
distance
came
more
words
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
i
had
a
trap-door
in
the
end
of
the
casket
when
you
didn't
answer
the
bell
i
found
i
could
come
alone
with
an
inarticulate
cry
biggs
stretched
out
his
trembling
arms
my
master
i
am
coming
now
then
he
swayed
stumbled
clutched
feebly
at
the
rail
and
plunged
headlong
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
a
crumpled
lifeless
form

of
