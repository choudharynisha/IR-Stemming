thomson
on
the
pleasant
banks
of
the
garonne
in
the
province
of
gascony
stood
in
the
year
1584
the
chã¢teau
of
monsieur
st
aubert
from
its
windows
were
seen
the
pastoral
landscapes
of
guienne
and
gascony
stretching
along
the
river
gay
with
luxuriant
woods
and
vine
and
plantations
of
olives
to
the
south
the
view
was
bounded
by
the
majestic
pyrenees
whose
summits
veiled
in
clouds
or
exhibiting
awful
forms
seen
and
lost
again
as
the
partial
vapours
rolled
along
were
sometimes
barren
and
gleamed
through
the
blue
tinge
of
air
and
sometimes
frowned
with
forests
of
gloomy
pine
that
swept
downward
to
their
base
these
tremendous
precipices
were
contrasted
by
the
soft
green
of
the
pastures
and
woods
that
hung
upon
their
skirts
among
whose
flocks
and
herds
and
simple
cottages
the
eye
after
having
scaled
the
cliffs
above
delighted
to
repose
to
the
north
and
to
the
east
the
plains
of
guienne
and
languedoc

lost
in
the
mist

by

m
st
aubert
loved
to
wander
with
his
wife
and
daughter
on
the
margin
of
the
garonne
and
to
listen
to
the
music
that
floated
on
its
waves
he
had
known
life
in
other
forms
than
those
of
pastoral
simplicity
having
mingled
in
the
gay
and
in
the
busy
scenes
of
the
world
but
the
flattering
portrait
of
mankind
which
his
heart
had
delineated
in
early
youth
his
experience
had
too
sorrowfully
corrected
yet
amidst
the
changing
visions
of
life
his
principles
remained
unshaken
his
benevolence
unchilled
and
he
retired
from
the
multitude
â€œmore
in
pity
than
in
angerâ€
to
scenes
of
simple
nature
to
the
pure
delights
of
literature
and
to
the
exercise
of
domestic
virtues
he
was
a
descendant
from
the
younger
branch
of
an
illustrious
family
and
it
was
designed
that
the
deficiency
of
his
patrimonial
wealth
should
be
supplied
either
by
a
splendid
alliance
in
marriage
or
by
success
in
the
intrigues
of
public
affairs
but
st
aubert
had
too
nice
a
sense
of
honour
to
fulfil
the
latter
hope
and
too
small
a
portion
of
ambition
to
sacrifice
what
he
called
happiness
to
the
attainment
of
wealth
after
the
death
of
his
father
he
married
a
very
amiable
woman
his
equal
in
birth
and
not
his
superior
in
fortune
the
late
monsieur
st
aubertâ€™s
liberality
or
extravagance
had
so
much
involved
his
affairs
that
his
son
found
it
necessary
to
dispose
of
a
part
of
the
family
domain
and
some
years
after
his
marriage
he
sold
it
to
monsieur
quesnel
the
brother
of
his
wife
and
retired
to
a
small
estate
in
gascony
where
conjugal
felicity
and
parental
duties
divided
his
attention
with
the
treasures
of
knowledge
and
the
illuminations
of
genius
to
this
spot
he
had
been
attached
from
his
infancy
he
had
often
made
excursions
to
it
when
a
boy
and
the
impressions
of
delight
given
to
his
mind
by
the
homely
kindness
of
the
grey-headed
peasant
to
whom
it
was
intrusted
and
whose
fruit
and
cream
never
failed
had
not
been
obliterated
by
succeeding
circumstances
the
green
pastures
along
which
he
had
so
often
bounded
in
the
exultation
of
health
and
youthful
freedomâ€”the
woods
under
whose
refreshing
shade
he
had
first
indulged
that
pensive
melancholy
which
afterwards
made
a
strong
feature
of
his
characterâ€”the
wild
walks
of
the
mountains
the
river
on
whose
waves
he
had
floated
and
the
distant
plains
which
seemed
boundless
as
his
early
hopesâ€”were
never
after
remembered
by
st
aubert
but
with
enthusiasm
and
regret
at
length
he
disengaged
himself
from
the
world
and
retired
hither
to
realise
the
wishes
of
many
years
the
building
as
it
then
stood
was
merely
a
summer
cottage
rendered
interesting
to
a
stranger
by
its
neat
simplicity
or
the
beauty
of
the
surrounding
scene
and
considerable
additions
were
necessary
to
make
it
a
comfortable
family
residence
st
aubert
felt
a
kind
of
affection
for
every
part
of
the
fabric
which
he
remembered
in
his
youth
and
would
not
suffer
a
stone
of
it
to
be
removed
so
that
the
new
building
adapted
to
the
style
of
the
old
one
formed
with
it
only
a
simple
and
elegant
residence
the
taste
of
madame
st
aubert
was
conspicuous
in
its
internal
finishing
where
the
same
chaste
simplicity
was
observable
in
the
furniture
and
in
the
few
ornaments
of
the
apartments
that
characterised
the
manners
of
its
inhabitants
the
library
occupied
the
west
side
of
the
chã¢teau
and
was
enriched
by
a
collection
of
the
best
books
in
the
ancient
and
modern
languages
this
room
opened
upon
a
grove
which
stood
on
the
brow
of
a
gentle
declivity
that
fell
towards
the
river
and
the
tall
trees
gave
it
a
melancholy
and
pleasing
shade
while
from
the
windows
the
eye
caught
beneath
the
spreading
branches
the
gay
and
luxuriant
landscape
stretching
to
the
west
and
overlooked
on
the
left
by
the
bold
precipices
of
the
pyrenees
adjoining
the
library
was
a
green-house
stored
with
scarce
and
beautiful
plants
for
one
of
the
amusements
of
st
aubert
was
the
study
of
botany
and
among
the
neighbouring
mountains
which
afforded
a
luxurious
feast
to
the
mind
of
the
naturalist
he
often
passed
the
day
in
the
pursuit
of
his
favourite
science
he
was
sometimes
accompanied
in
these
little
excursions
by
madame
st
aubert
and
frequently
by
his
daughter
when
with
a
small
osier
basket
to
receive
plants
and
another
filled
with
cold
refreshments
such
as
the
cabin
of
the
shepherd
did
not
afford
they
wandered
away
among
the
most
romantic
and
magnificent
scenes
nor
suffered
the
charms
of
natureâ€™s
lowly
children
to
abstract
them
from
the
observance
of
her
stupendous
works
when
weary
of
sauntering
among
cliffs
that
seemed
scarcely
accessible
but
to
the
steps
of
the
enthusiast
and
where
no
track
appeared
on
the
vegetation
but
what
the
foot
of
the
izard
had
left
they
would
seek
one
of
those
green
recesses
which
so
beautifully
adorn
the
bosom
of
these
mountains
where
under
the
shade
of
the
lofty
larch
or
cedar
they
enjoyed
their
simple
repast
made
sweeter
by
the
waters
of
the
cool
stream
that
crept
along
the
turf
and
by
the
breath
of
wild
flowers
and
aromatic
plants
that
fringed
the
rocks
and
inlaid
the
grass
adjoining
the
eastern
side
of
the
green-house
looking
towards
the
plains
of
languedoc
was
a
room
which
emily
called
hers
and
which
contained
her
books
her
drawings
her
musical
instruments
with
some
favourite
birds
and
plants
here
she
usually
exercised
herself
in
elegant
arts
cultivated
only
because
they
were
congenial
to
her
taste
and
in
which
native
genius
assisted
by
the
instructions
of
monsieur
and
madame
st
aubert
made
her
an
early
proficient
the
windows
of
this
room
were
particularly
pleasant
they
descended
to
the
floor
and
opening
upon
the
little
lawn
that
surrounded
the
house
the
eye
was
led
between
groves
of
almond
palm-trees
flowering-ash
and
myrtle
to
the
distant
landscape
where
the
garonne
wandered
the
peasants
of
this
gay
climate
were
often
seen
on
an
evening
when
the
dayâ€™s
labour
was
done
dancing
in
groups
on
the
margin
of
the
river
their
sprightly
melodies
debonnaire
steps
the
fanciful
figure
of
their
dances
with
the
tasteful
and
capricious
manner
in
which
the
girls
adjusted
their
simple
dress
gave
a
character
to
the
scene
entirely
french
the
front
of
the
chã¢teau
which
having
a
southern
aspect
opened
upon
the
grandeur
of
the
mountains
was
occupied
on
the
ground
floor
by
a
rustic
hall
and
two
excellent
sitting
rooms
the
first
floor
for
the
cottage
had
no
second
story
was
laid
out
in
bed-chambers
except
one
apartment
that
opened
to
a
balcony
and
which
was
generally
used
for
a
breakfast-room
in
the
surrounding
ground
st
aubert
had
made
very
tasteful
improvements
yet
such
was
his
attachment
to
objects
he
had
remembered
from
his
boyish
days
that
he
had
in
some
instances
sacrificed
taste
to
sentiment
there
were
two
old
larches
that
shaded
the
building
and
interrupted
the
prospect
st
aubert
had
sometimes
declared
that
he
believed
he
should
have
been
weak
enough
to
have
wept
at
their
fall
in
addition
to
these
larches
he
planted
a
little
grove
of
beech
pine
and
mountain-ash
on
a
lofty
terrace
formed
by
the
swelling
bank
of
the
river
rose
a
plantation
of
orange
lemon
and
palm-trees
whose
fruit
in
the
coolness
of
evening
breathed
delicious
fragrance
with
these
were
mingled
a
few
trees
of
other
species
here
under
the
ample
shade
of
a
plane-tree
that
spread
its
majestic
canopy
towards
the
river
st
aubert
loved
to
sit
in
the
fine
evenings
of
summer
with
his
wife
and
children
watching
beneath
its
foliage
the
setting
sun
the
mild
splendour
of
its
light
fading
from
the
distant
landscape
till
the
shadows
of
twilight
melted
its
various
features
into
one
tint
of
sober
grey
here
too
he
loved
to
read
and
to
converse
with
madame
st
aubert
or
to
play
with
his
children
resigning
himself
to
the
influence
of
those
sweet
affections
which
are
ever
attendant
on
simplicity
and
nature
he
has
often
said
while
tears
of
pleasure
trembled
in
his
eyes
that
these
were
moments
infinitely
more
delightful
than
any
passed
amid
the
brilliant
and
tumultuous
scenes
that
are
courted
by
the
world
his
heart
was
occupied
it
had
what
can
be
so
rarely
said
no
wish
for
a
happiness
beyond
what
it
experienced
the
consciousness
of
acting
right
diffused
a
serenity
over
his
manners
which
nothing
else
could
impart
to
a
man
of
moral
perceptions
like
his
and
which
refined
his
sense
of
every
surrounding
blessing
the
deepest
shade
of
twilight
did
not
send
him
from
his
favourite
plane-tree
he
loved
the
soothing
hour
when
the
last
tints
of
light
die
away
when
the
stars
one
by
one
tremble
through
ã¦ther
and
are
reflected
on
the
dark
mirror
of
the
waters
that
hour
which
of
all
others
inspires
the
mind
with
pensive
tenderness
and
often
elevates
it
to
sublime
contemplation
when
the
moon
shed
her
soft
rays
among
the
foliage
he
still
lingered
and
his
pastoral
supper
of
cream
and
fruits
was
often
spread
beneath
it
then
on
the
stillness
of
night
came
the
song
of
the
nightingale
breathing
sweetness
and
awakening
melancholy
the
first
interruptions
to
the
happiness
he
had
known
since
his
retirement
were
occasioned
by
the
death
of
his
two
sons
he
lost
them
at
that
age
when
infantine
simplicity
is
so
fascinating
and
though
in
consideration
of
madame
st
aubertâ€™s
distress
he
restrained
the
expression
of
his
own
and
endeavoured
to
bear
it
as
he
meant
with
philosophy
he
had
in
truth
no
philosophy
that
could
render
him
calm
to
such
losses
one
daughter
was
now
his
only
surviving
child
and
while
he
watched
the
unfolding
of
her
infant
character
with
anxious
fondness
he
endeavoured
with
unremitting
effort
to
counteract
those
traits
in
her
disposition
which
might
hereafter
lead
her
from
happiness
she
had
discovered
in
her
early
years
uncommon
delicacy
of
mind
warm
affections
and
ready
benevolence
but
with
these
was
observable
a
degree
of
susceptibility
too
exquisite
to
admit
of
lasting
peace
as
she
advanced
in
youth
this
sensibility
gave
a
pensive
tone
to
her
spirits
and
a
softness
to
her
manner
which
added
grace
to
beauty
and
rendered
her
a
very
interesting
object
to
persons
of
a
congenial
disposition
but
st
aubert
had
too
much
good
sense
to
prefer
a
charm
to
a
virtue
and
had
penetration
enough
to
see
that
this
charm
was
too
dangerous
to
its
possessor
to
be
allowed
the
character
of
a
blessing
he
endeavoured
therefore
to
strengthen
her
mind
to
enure
her
to
habits
of
self-command
to
teach
her
to
reject
the
first
impulse
of
her
feelings
and
to
look
with
cool
examination
upon
the
disappointments
he
sometimes
threw
in
her
way
while
he
instructed
her
to
resist
first
impressions
and
to
acquire
that
steady
dignity
of
mind
that
can
alone
counterbalance
the
passions
and
bear
us
as
far
as
is
compatible
with
our
nature
above
the
reach
of
circumstances
he
taught
himself
a
lesson
of
fortitude
for
he
was
often
obliged
to
witness
with
seeming
indifference
the
tears
and
struggles
which
his
caution
occasioned
her
in
person
emily
resembled
her
mother
having
the
same
elegant
symmetry
of
form
the
same
delicacy
of
features
and
the
same
blue
eyes
full
of
tender
sweetness
but
lovely
as
was
her
person
it
was
the
varied
expression
of
her
countenance
as
conversation
awakened
the
nicer
emotions
of
her
mind
that
threw
such
a
captivating
grace
around
her
those
tendâ€™rer
tints
that
shun
the
careless
eye
and
in
the
worldâ€™s
contagious
circle
die
st
aubert
cultivated
her
understanding
with
the
most
scrupulous
care
he
gave
her
a
general
view
of
the
sciences
and
an
exact
acquaintance
with
every
part
of
elegant
literature
he
taught
her
latin
and
english
chiefly
that
she
might
understand
the
sublimity
of
their
best
poets
she
discovered
in
her
early
years
a
taste
for
works
of
genius
and
it
was
st
aubertâ€™s
principle
as
well
as
his
inclination
to
promote
every
innocent
means
of
happiness
â€œa
well-informed
mindâ€
he
would
say
â€œis
the
best
security
against
the
contagion
of
folly
and
of
vice
the
vacant
mind
is
ever
on
the
watch
for
relief
and
ready
to
plunge
into
error
to
escape
from
the
languor
of
idleness
store
it
with
ideas
teach
it
the
pleasure
of
thinking
and
the
temptations
of
the
world
without
will
be
counteracted
by
the
gratifications
derived
from
the
world
within
thought
and
cultivation
are
necessary
equally
to
the
happiness
of
a
country
and
a
city
life
in
the
first
they
prevent
the
uneasy
sensations
of
indolence
and
afford
a
sublime
pleasure
in
the
taste
they
create
for
the
beautiful
and
the
grand
in
the
latter
they
make
dissipation
less
an
object
of
necessity
and
consequently
of
interestâ€
it
was
one
of
emilyâ€™s
earliest
pleasures
to
ramble
among
the
scenes
of
nature
nor
was
it
in
the
soft
and
glowing
landscape
that
she
most
delighted
she
loved
more
the
wild
wood-walks
that
skirted
the
mountain
and
still
more
the
mountainâ€™s
stupendous
recesses
where
the
silence
and
grandeur
of
solitude
impressed
a
sacred
awe
upon
her
heart
and
lifted
her
thoughts
to
the
god
of
heaven
and
earth
in
scenes
like
these
she
would
often
linger
along
wrapt
in
a
melancholy
charm
till
the
last
gleam
of
day
faded
from
the
west
till
the
lonely
sound
of
a
sheep-bell
or
the
distant
bark
of
a
watch-dog
were
all
that
broke
on
the
stillness
of
the
evening
then
the
gloom
of
the
woods
the
trembling
of
their
leaves
at
intervals
in
the
breeze
the
bat
flitting
on
the
twilight
the
cottage-lights
now
seen
and
now
lostâ€”were
circumstances
that
awakened
her
mind
into
effort
and
led
to
enthusiasm
and
poetry
her
favourite
walk
was
to
a
little
fishing-house
belonging
to
st
aubert
in
a
woody
glen
on
the
margin
of
a
rivulet
that
descended
from
the
pyrenees
and
after
foaming
among
their
rocks
wound
its
silent
way
beneath
the
shades
it
reflected
above
the
woods
that
screened
this
glen
rose
the
lofty
summits
of
the
pyrenees
which
often
burst
boldly
on
the
eye
through
the
glades
below
sometimes
the
shattered
face
of
a
rock
only
was
seen
crowned
with
wild
shrubs
or
a
shepherdâ€™s
cabin
seated
on
a
cliff
overshadowed
by
dark
cypress
or
waving
ash
emerging
from
the
deep
recesses
of
the
woods
the
glade
opened
to
the
distant
landscape
where
the
rich
pastures
and
vine-covered
slopes
of
gascony
gradually
declined
to
the
plains
and
there
on
the
winding
shores
of
the
garonne
groves
and
hamlets
and
villasâ€”their
outlines
softened
by
distance
melted
from
the
eye
into
one
rich
harmonious
tint
this
too
was
the
favourite
retreat
of
st
aubert
to
which
he
frequently
withdrew
from
the
fervour
of
noon
with
his
wife
his
daughter
and
his
books
or
came
at
the
sweet
evening
hour
to
welcome
the
silent
dusk
or
to
listen
for
the
music
of
the
nightingale
sometimes
too
he
brought
music
of
his
own
and
awakened
every
fairy
echo
with
the
tender
accents
of
his
oboe
and
often
have
the
tones
of
emilyâ€™s
voice
drawn
sweetness
from
the
waves
over
which
they
trembled
it
was
in
one
of
these
excursions
to
this
spot
that
she
observed
the
following
lines
written
with
a
pencil
on
a
part
of
the
wainscot
sonnet
go
pencil
faithful
to
thy
masterâ€™s
sighs
goâ€”tell
the
goddess
of
the
fairy
scene
when
next
her
light
steps
wind
these
wood-walks
green
whence
all
his
tears
his
tender
sorrows
rise
ah
paint
her
form
her
soul-illuminâ€™d
eyes
the
sweet
expression
of
her
pensive
face
the
lightâ€™ning
smile
the
animated
graceâ€”
the
portrait
well
the
loverâ€™s
voice
supplies
speaks
all
his
heart
must
feel
his
tongue
would
say
yet
ah
not
all
his
heart
must
sadly
feel
how
oft
the
flowâ€™retâ€™s
silken
leaves
conceal
the
drug
that
steals
the
vital
spark
away
and
who
that
gazes
on
that
angel-smile
would
fear
its
charm
or
think
it
could
beguile
these
lines
were
not
inscribed
to
any
person
emily
therefore
could
not
apply
them
to
herself
though
she
was
undoubtedly
the
nymph
of
these
shades
having
glanced
round
the
little
circle
of
her
acquaintance
without
being
detained
by
a
suspicion
as
to
whom
they
could
be
addressed
she
was
compelled
to
rest
in
uncertainty
an
uncertainty
which
would
have
been
more
painful
to
an
idle
mind
than
it
was
to
hers
she
had
no
leisure
to
suffer
this
circumstance
trifling
at
first
to
swell
into
importance
by
frequent
remembrance
the
little
vanity
it
had
excited
for
the
incertitude
which
forbade
her
to
presume
upon
having
inspired
the
sonnet
forbade
her
also
to
disbelieve
it
passed
away
and
the
incident
was
dismissed
from
her
thoughts
amid
her
books
her
studies
and
the
exercise
of
social
charities
soon
after
this
period
her
anxiety
was
awakened
by
the
indisposition
of
her
father
who
was
attacked
with
a
fever
which
though
not
thought
to
be
of
a
dangerous
kind
gave
a
severe
shock
to
his
constitution
madame
st
aubert
and
emily
attended
him
with
unremitting
care
but
his
recovery
was
very
slow
and
as
he
advanced
towards
health
madame
seemed
to
decline
the
first
scene
he
visited
after
he
was
well
enough
to
take
the
air
was
his
favourite
fishing-house
a
basket
of
provisions
was
sent
thither
with
books
and
emilyâ€™s
lute
for
fishing-tackle
he
had
no
use
for
he
never
could
find
amusement
in
torturing
or
destroying
after
employing
himself
for
about
an
hour
in
botanizing
dinner
was
served
it
was
a
repast
to
which
gratitude
for
being
again
permitted
to
visit
this
spot
gave
sweetness
and
family
happiness
once
more
smiled
beneath
these
shades
monsieur
st
aubert
conversed
with
unusual
cheerfulness
every
object
delighted
his
senses
the
refreshing
pleasure
from
the
first
view
of
nature
after
the
pain
of
illness
and
the
confinement
of
a
sick-chamber
is
above
the
conceptions
as
well
as
the
descriptions
of
those
in
health
the
green
woods
and
pastures
the
flowery
turf
the
blue
concave
of
the
heavens
the
balmy
air
the
murmur
of
the
limpid
stream
and
even
the
hum
of
every
little
insect
of
the
shade
seem
to
revivify
the
soul
and
make
mere
existence
bliss
madame
st
aubert
reanimated
by
the
cheerfulness
and
recovery
of
her
husband
was
no
longer
sensible
of
the
indisposition
which
had
lately
oppressed
her
and
as
she
sauntered
along
the
wood-walks
of
this
romantic
glen
and
conversed
with
him
and
with
her
daughter
she
often
looked
at
them
alternately
with
a
degree
of
tenderness
that
filled
her
eyes
with
tears
st
aubert
observed
this
more
than
once
and
gently
reproved
her
for
the
emotion
but
she
could
only
smile
clasp
his
hand
and
that
of
emily
and
weep
the
more
he
felt
the
tender
enthusiasm
stealing
upon
himself
in
a
degree
that
became
almost
painful
his
features
assumed
a
serious
air
and
he
could
not
forbear
secretly
sighingâ€”â€œperhaps
i
shall
some
time
look
back
to
these
moments
as
to
the
summit
of
my
happiness
with
hopeless
regret
but
let
me
not
misuse
them
by
useless
anticipation
let
me
hope
i
shall
not
live
to
mourn
the
loss
of
those
who
are
dearer
to
me
than
lifeâ€
to
relieve
or
perhaps
to
indulge
the
pensive
temper
of
his
mind
he
bade
emily
fetch
the
lute
she
knew
how
to
touch
with
such
sweet
pathos
as
she
drew
near
the
fishing-house
she
was
surprised
to
hear
the
tones
of
the
instrument
which
were
awakened
by
the
hand
of
taste
and
uttered
a
plaintive
air
whose
exquisite
melody
engaged
all
her
attention
she
listened
in
profound
silence
afraid
to
move
from
the
spot
lest
the
sound
of
her
steps
should
occasion
her
to
lose
a
note
of
the
music
or
should
disturb
the
musician
everything
without
the
building
was
still
and
no
person
appeared
she
continued
to
listen
till
timidity
succeeded
to
surprise
and
delight
a
timidity
increased
by
a
remembrance
of
the
pencilled
lines
she
had
formerly
seen
and
she
hesitated
whether
to
proceed
or
to
return
while
she
paused
the
music
ceased
and
after
a
momentary
hesitation
she
recollected
courage
to
advance
to
the
fishing-house
which
she
entered
with
faltering
steps
and
found
unoccupied
her
lute
lay
on
the
table
everything
seemed
undisturbed
and
she
began
to
believe
it
was
another
instrument
she
had
heard
till
she
remembered
that
when
she
followed
m
and
madame
st
aubert
from
this
spot
her
lute
was
left
on
a
window
seat
she
felt
alarmed
yet
knew
not
wherefore
the
melancholy
gloom
of
evening
and
the
profound
stillness
of
the
place
interrupted
only
by
the
light
trembling
of
leaves
heightened
her
fanciful
apprehensions
and
she
was
desirous
of
quitting
the
building
but
perceived
herself
grow
faint
and
sat
down
as
she
tried
to
recover
herself
the
pencilled
lines
on
the
wainscot
met
her
eye
she
started
as
if
she
had
seen
a
stranger
but
endeavouring
to
conquer
the
tremor
of
her
spirits
rose
and
went
to
the
window
to
the
lines
before
noticed
she
now
perceived
that
others
were
added
in
which
her
name
appeared
though
no
longer
suffered
to
doubt
that
they
were
addressed
to
herself
she
was
as
ignorant
as
before
by
whom
they
could
be
written
while
she
mused
she
thought
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
step
without
the
building
and
again
alarmed
she
caught
up
her
lute
and
hurried
away
monsieur
and
madame
st
aubert
she
found
in
a
little
path
that
wound
along
the
sides
of
the
glen
having
reached
a
green
summit
shadowed
by
palm-trees
and
overlooking
the
valleys
and
plains
of
gascony
they
seated
themselves
on
the
turf
and
while
their
eyes
wandered
over
the
glorious
scene
and
they
inhaled
the
sweet
breath
of
flowers
and
herbs
that
enriched
the
grass
emily
played
and
sung
several
of
their
favourite
airs
with
the
delicacy
of
expression
in
which
she
so
much
excelled
music
and
conversation
detained
them
in
this
enchanting
spot
till
the
sunâ€™s
last
light
slept
upon
the
plains
till
the
white
sails
that
glided
beneath
the
mountains
where
the
garonne
wandered
became
dim
and
the
gloom
of
evening
stole
over
the
landscape
it
was
a
melancholy
but
not
unpleasing
gloom
st
aubert
and
his
family
rose
and
left
the
place
with
regret
alas
madame
st
aubert
knew
not
that
she
left
it
for
ever
when
they
reached
the
fishing-house
she
missed
her
bracelet
and
recollected
that
she
had
taken
it
from
her
arm
after
dinner
and
had
left
it
on
the
table
when
she
went
to
walk
after
a
long
search
in
which
emily
was
very
active
she
was
compelled
to
resign
herself
to
the
loss
of
it
what
made
this
bracelet
valuable
to
her
was
a
miniature
of
her
daughter
to
which
it
was
attached
esteemed
a
striking
resemblance
and
which
had
been
painted
only
a
few
months
before
when
emily
was
convinced
that
the
bracelet
was
really
gone
she
blushed
and
became
thoughtful
that
some
stranger
had
been
in
the
fishing-house
during
her
absence
her
lute
and
the
additional
lines
of
a
pencil
had
already
informed
her
from
the
purport
of
these
lines
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
believe
that
the
poet
the
musician
and
the
thief
were
the
same
person
but
though
the
music
she
had
heard
the
written
lines
she
had
seen
and
the
disappearance
of
the
picture
formed
a
combination
of
circumstances
very
remarkable
she
was
irresistibly
restrained
from
mentioning
them
secretly
determining
however
never
again
to
visit
the
fishing-house
without
monsieur
or
madame
st
aubert
they
returned
pensively
to
the
chã¢teau
emily
musing
on
the
incident
which
had
just
occurred
st
aubert
reflecting
with
placid
gratitude
on
the
blessings
he
possessed
and
madame
st
aubert
somewhat
disturbed
and
perplexed
by
the
loss
of
her
daughterâ€™s
picture
as
they
drew
near
the
house
they
observed
an
unusual
bustle
about
it
the
sound
of
voices
was
distinctly
heard
servants
and
horses
were
seen
passing
between
the
trees
and
at
length
the
wheels
of
a
carriage
rolled
along
having
come
within
view
of
the
front
of
the
chã¢teau
a
landau
with
smoking
horses
appeared
on
the
little
lawn
before
it
st
aubert
perceived
the
liveries
of
his
brother-in-law
and
in
the
parlour
he
found
monsieur
and
madame
quesnel
already
entered
they
had
left
paris
some
days
before
and
were
on
the
way
to
their
estate
only
ten
leagues
distant
from
la
vallã©e
and
which
monsieur
quesnel
had
purchased
several
years
before
of
st
aubert
this
gentleman
was
the
only
brother
of
madame
st
aubert
but
the
ties
of
relationship
having
never
been
strengthened
by
congeniality
of
character
the
intercourse
between
them
had
not
been
frequent
m
quesnel
had
lived
altogether
in
the
world
his
aim
had
been
consequence
splendour
was
the
object
of
his
taste
and
his
address
and
knowledge
of
character
had
carried
him
forward
to
the
attainment
of
almost
all
that
he
had
courted
by
a
man
of
such
a
disposition
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
virtues
of
st
aubert
should
be
overlooked
or
that
his
pure
taste
simplicity
and
moderated
wishes
were
considered
as
marks
of
a
weak
intellect
and
of
confined
views
the
marriage
of
his
sister
with
st
aubert
had
been
mortifying
to
his
ambition
for
he
had
designed
that
the
matrimonial
connection
she
formed
should
assist
him
to
attain
the
consequence
which
he
so
much
desired
and
some
offers
were
made
her
by
persons
whose
rank
and
fortune
flattered
his
warmest
hope
but
his
sister
who
was
then
addressed
also
by
st
aubert
perceived
or
thought
she
perceived
that
happiness
and
splendour
were
not
the
same
and
she
did
not
hesitate
to
forego
the
last
for
the
attainment
of
the
former
whether
monsieur
quesnel
thought
them
the
same
or
not
he
would
readily
have
sacrificed
his
sisterâ€™s
peace
to
the
gratification
of
his
own
ambition
and
on
her
marriage
with
st
aubert
expressed
in
private
his
contempt
of
her
spiritless
conduct
and
of
the
connection
which
it
permitted
madame
st
aubert
though
she
concealed
this
insult
from
her
husband
felt
perhaps
for
the
first
time
resentment
lighted
in
her
heart
and
though
a
regard
for
her
own
dignity
united
with
considerations
of
prudence
restrained
her
expression
of
this
resentment
there
was
ever
after
a
mild
reserve
in
her
manner
towards
m
quesnel
which
he
both
understood
and
felt
in
his
own
marriage
he
did
not
follow
his
sisterâ€™s
example
his
lady
was
an
italian
and
an
heiress
by
birth
and
by
nature
and
education
was
a
vain
and
frivolous
woman
they
now
determined
to
pass
the
night
with
st
aubert
and
as
the
chã¢teau
was
not
large
enough
to
accommodate
their
servants
the
latter
were
dismissed
to
the
neighbouring
village
when
the
first
compliments
were
over
and
the
arrangements
for
the
night
made
m
quesnel
began
the
display
of
his
intelligence
and
his
connections
while
st
aubert
who
had
been
long
enough
in
retirement
to
find
these
topics
recommended
by
their
novelty
listened
with
a
degree
of
patience
and
attention
which
his
guest
mistook
for
the
humility
of
wonder
the
latter
indeed
described
the
few
festivities
which
the
turbulence
of
that
period
permitted
to
the
court
of
henry
the
third
with
a
minuteness
that
somewhat
recompensed
for
his
ostentation
but
when
he
came
to
speak
of
the
character
of
the
duke
de
joyeuse
of
a
secret
treaty
which
he
knew
to
be
negotiating
with
the
porte
and
of
the
light
in
which
henry
of
navarre
was
received
m
st
aubert
recollected
enough
of
his
former
experience
to
be
assured
that
his
guest
could
be
only
of
an
inferior
class
of
politicians
and
that
from
the
importance
of
the
subjects
upon
which
he
committed
himself
he
could
not
be
of
the
rank
to
which
he
pretended
to
belong
the
opinions
delivered
by
m
quesnel
were
such
as
st
aubert
forebore
to
reply
to
for
he
knew
that
his
guest
had
neither
humanity
to
feel
nor
discernment
to
perceive
what
is
just
madame
quesnel
meanwhile
was
expressing
to
madame
st
aubert
her
astonishment
that
she
could
bear
to
pass
her
life
in
this
remote
corner
of
the
world
as
she
called
it
and
describing
from
a
wish
probably
of
exciting
envy
the
splendour
of
the
balls
banquets
and
processions
which
had
just
been
given
by
the
court
in
honour
of
the
nuptials
of
the
duke
de
joyeuse
with
margaretta
of
lorrain
the
sister
of
the
queen
she
described
with
equal
minuteness
the
magnificence
she
had
seen
and
that
from
which
she
had
been
excluded
while
emilyâ€™s
vivid
fancy
as
she
listened
with
the
ardent
curiosity
of
youth
heightened
the
scenes
she
heard
of
and
madame
st
aubert
looking
on
her
family
felt
as
a
tear
stole
to
her
eye
that
though
splendour
may
grace
happiness
virtue
only
can
bestow
it
â€œit
is
now
twelve
years
st
aubertâ€
said
m
quesnel
â€œsince
i
purchased
your
family
estateâ€â€”â€œsomewhere
thereaboutâ€
replied
st
aubert
suppressing
a
sigh
â€œit
is
near
five
years
since
i
have
been
thereâ€
resumed
quesnel
â€œfor
paris
and
its
neighbourhood
is
the
only
place
in
the
world
to
live
in
and
i
am
so
immersed
in
politics
and
have
so
many
affairs
of
moment
on
my
hands
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
steal
away
even
for
a
month
or
twoâ€
st
aubert
remaining
silent
m
quesnel
proceeded
â€œi
have
sometimes
wondered
how
you
who
have
lived
in
the
capital
and
have
been
accustomed
to
company
can
exist
elsewhereâ€”especially
in
so
remote
a
country
as
this
where
you
can
neither
hear
nor
see
anything
and
can
in
short
be
scarcely
conscious
of
lifeâ€
â€œi
live
for
my
family
and
myselfâ€
said
st
aubert
â€œi
am
now
contented
to
know
only
happinessâ€”formerly
i
knew
lifeâ€
â€œi
mean
to
expend
thirty
or
forty
thousand
livres
on
improvementsâ€
said
m
quesnel
without
seeming
to
notice
the
words
of
st
aubert
â€œfor
i
design
next
summer
to
bring
here
my
friends
the
duke
de
durefort
and
the
marquis
ramont
to
pass
a
month
or
two
with
meâ€
to
st
aubertâ€™s
enquiry
as
to
these
intended
improvements
he
replied
that
he
should
take
down
the
whole
east
wing
of
the
chã¢teau
and
raise
upon
the
site
a
set
of
stables
â€œthen
i
shall
buildâ€
said
he
â€œa
salle
ã
manger
a
salon
a
salle
au
commune
and
a
number
of
rooms
for
servants
for
at
present
there
is
not
accommodation
for
a
third
part
of
my
own
peopleâ€
â€œit
accommodated
our
fatherâ€™s
householdâ€
said
st
aubert
grieved
that
the
old
mansion
was
to
be
thus
improved
â€œand
that
was
not
a
small
oneâ€
â€œour
notions
are
somewhat
enlarged
since
those
daysâ€
said
m
quesnelâ€”â€œwhat
was
then
thought
a
decent
style
of
living
would
not
now
be
enduredâ€
even
the
calm
st
aubert
blushed
at
these
words
but
his
anger
soon
yielded
to
contempt
â€œthe
ground
about
the
chã¢teau
is
encumbered
with
trees
i
mean
to
cut
some
of
them
downâ€
â€œcut
down
the
trees
tooâ€
said
st
aubert
â€œcertainly
why
should
i
not
they
interrupt
my
prospects
there
is
a
chesnut
which
spreads
its
branches
before
the
whole
south
side
of
the
chã¢teau
and
which
is
so
ancient
that
they
tell
me
the
hollow
of
its
trunk
will
hold
a
dozen
men
your
enthusiasm
will
scarcely
contend
that
there
can
be
either
use
or
beauty
in
such
a
sapless
old
tree
as
thisâ€
â€œgood
godâ€
exclaimed
st
aubert
â€œyou
surely
will
not
destroy
that
noble
chesnut
which
has
flourished
for
centuries
the
glory
of
the
estate
it
was
in
its
maturity
when
the
present
mansion
was
built
how
often
in
my
youth
have
i
climbed
among
its
broad
branches
and
sat
embowered
amidst
a
world
of
leaves
while
the
heavy
shower
has
pattered
above
and
not
a
rain
drop
reached
me
how
often
i
have
sat
with
a
book
in
my
hand
sometimes
reading
and
sometimes
looking
out
between
the
branches
upon
the
wide
landscape
and
the
setting
sun
till
twilight
came
and
brought
the
birds
home
to
their
little
nests
among
the
leaves
how
oftenâ€”but
pardon
meâ€
added
st
aubert
recollecting
that
he
was
speaking
to
a
man
who
could
neither
comprehend
nor
allow
his
feelings
â€œi
am
talking
of
times
and
feelings
as
old-fashioned
as
the
taste
that
would
spare
that
venerable
treeâ€
â€œit
will
certainly
come
downâ€
said
m
quesnel
â€œi
believe
i
shall
plant
some
lombardy
poplars
among
the
clumps
of
chesnut
that
i
shall
leave
of
the
avenue
madame
quesnel
is
partial
to
the
poplar
and
tells
me
how
much
it
adorns
a
villa
of
her
uncle
not
far
from
veniceâ€
â€œon
the
banks
of
the
brenta
indeedâ€
continued
st
aubert
â€œwhere
its
spiry
form
is
intermingled
with
the
pine
and
the
cypress
and
where
it
plays
over
light
and
elegant
porticos
and
colonnades
it
unquestionably
adorns
the
scene
but
among
the
giants
of
the
forest
and
near
a
heavy
gothic
mansionâ€”â€
â€œwell
my
good
sirâ€
said
m
quesnel
â€œi
will
not
dispute
with
you
you
must
return
to
paris
before
our
ideas
can
at
all
agree
but
ã
propos
of
venice
i
have
some
thoughts
of
going
thither
next
summer
events
may
call
me
to
take
possession
of
that
same
villa
too
which
they
tell
me
is
the
most
charming
that
can
be
imagined
in
that
case
i
shall
leave
the
improvements
i
mention
to
another
year
and
i
may
perhaps
be
tempted
to
stay
some
time
in
italyâ€
emily
was
somewhat
surprised
to
hear
him
talk
of
being
tempted
to
remain
abroad
after
he
had
mentioned
his
presence
to
be
so
necessary
at
paris
that
it
was
with
difficulty
he
could
steal
away
for
a
month
or
two
but
st
aubert
understood
the
self-importance
of
the
man
too
well
to
wonder
at
this
trait
and
the
possibility
that
these
projected
improvements
might
be
deferred
gave
him
a
hope
that
they
might
never
take
place
before
they
separated
for
the
night
m
quesnel
desired
to
speak
with
st
aubert
alone
and
they
retired
to
another
room
where
they
remained
a
considerable
time
the
subject
of
this
conversation
was
not
known
but
whatever
it
might
be
st
aubert
when
he
returned
to
the
supper-room
seemed
much
disturbed
and
a
shade
of
sorrow
sometimes
fell
upon
his
features
that
alarmed
madame
st
aubert
when
they
were
alone
she
was
tempted
to
enquire
the
occasion
of
it
but
the
delicacy
of
mind
which
had
ever
appeared
in
his
conduct
restrained
her
she
considered
that
if
st
aubert
wished
her
to
be
acquainted
with
the
subject
of
his
concern
he
would
not
wait
on
her
enquiries
on
the
following
day
before
m
quesnel
departed
he
had
a
second
conference
with
st
aubert
the
guests
after
dining
at
the
chã¢teau
set
out
in
the
cool
of
the
day
for
epourville
whither
they
gave
him
and
madame
st
aubert
a
pressing
invitation
prompted
rather
by
the
vanity
of
displaying
their
splendour
than
by
a
wish
to
make
their
friends
happy
emily
returned
with
delight
to
the
liberty
which
their
presence
had
restrained
to
her
books
her
walks
and
the
rational
conversation
of
m
and
madame
st
aubert
who
seemed
to
rejoice
no
less
that
they
were
delivered
from
the
shackles
which
arrogance
and
frivolity
had
imposed
madame
st
aubert
excused
herself
from
sharing
their
usual
evening
walk
complaining
that
she
was
not
quite
well
and
st
aubert
and
emily
went
out
together
they
chose
a
walk
towards
the
mountains
intending
to
visit
some
old
pensioners
of
st
aubert
which
from
his
very
moderate
income
he
contrived
to
support
though
it
is
probable
m
quesnel
with
his
very
large
one
could
not
have
afforded
this
after
distributing
to
his
pensioners
their
weekly
stipends
listening
patiently
to
the
complaints
of
some
redressing
the
grievances
of
others
and
softening
the
discontents
of
all
by
the
look
of
sympathy
and
the
smile
of
benevolence
st
aubert
returned
home
through
the
woods
where
at
fall
of
eve
the
fairy-people
throng
in
various
games
and
revelry
to
pass
the
summer
night
as
village
stories
tell
thomson
â€œthe
evening
gloom
of
woods
was
always
delightful
to
meâ€
said
st
aubert
whose
mind
now
experienced
the
sweet
calm
which
results
from
the
consciousness
of
having
done
a
beneficent
action
and
which
disposes
it
to
receive
pleasure
from
every
surrounding
object
â€œi
remember
that
in
my
youth
this
gloom
used
to
call
forth
to
my
fancy
a
thousand
fairy
visions
and
romantic
images
and
i
own
i
am
not
yet
wholly
insensible
of
that
high
enthusiasm
which
wakes
the
poetâ€™s
dream
i
can
linger
with
solemn
steps
under
the
deep
shades
send
forward
a
transforming
eye
into
the
distant
obscurity
and
listen
with
thrilling
delight
to
the
mystic
murmuring
of
the
woodsâ€
â€œo
my
dear
fatherâ€
said
emily
while
a
sudden
tear
started
to
her
eye
â€œhow
exactly
you
describe
what
i
have
felt
so
often
and
which
i
thought
nobody
had
ever
felt
but
myself
but
hark
here
comes
the
sweeping
sound
over
the
wood-topsâ€”now
it
dies
awayâ€”how
solemn
the
stillness
that
succeeds
now
the
breeze
swells
again
it
is
like
the
voice
of
some
supernatural
beingâ€”the
voice
of
the
spirit
of
the
woods
that
watches
over
them
by
night
ah
what
light
is
yonder
but
it
is
gone
and
now
it
gleams
again
near
the
root
of
that
large
chestnut
look
sirâ€
â€œare
you
such
an
admirer
of
natureâ€
said
st
aubert
â€œand
so
little
acquainted
with
her
appearances
as
not
to
know
that
for
the
glow-worm
but
comeâ€
added
he
gaily
â€œstep
a
little
further
and
we
shall
see
fairies
perhaps
they
are
often
companions
the
glow-worm
lends
his
light
and
they
in
return
charm
him
with
music
and
the
dance
do
you
see
nothing
tripping
yonderâ€
emily
laughed
â€œwell
my
dear
sirâ€
said
she
â€œsince
you
allow
of
this
alliance
i
may
venture
to
own
i
have
anticipated

almost
dare
venture
to
repeat
some
verses

made
one
evening
in

woodsâ€
â€œnayâ€

st

â€œwhile

lines
go
in

well
enough
but
i
fear
they
are
too
irregularâ€
the
glow-worm
how
pleasant
is
the
green-woodâ€™s
deep-matted
shade
on
a
mid-summerâ€™s
eve
when
the
fresh
rain
is
oâ€™er
when
the
yellow
beams
slope
and
sparkle
throâ€™
the
glade
and
swiftly
in
the
thin
air
the
light
swallows
soar
but
sweeter
sweeter
still
when
the
sun
sinks
to
rest
and
twilight
comes
on
with
the
fairies
so
gay
tripping
through
the
forest-walk
where
flowâ€™rs
unprest
bow
not
their
tall
heads
beneath
their
frolic
play
to
musicâ€™s
softest
sounds
they
dance
away
the
hour
till
moonlight
steals
down
among
the
trembling
leaves
and
checquers
all
the
ground
and
guides
them
to
the
bowâ€™r
the
long
haunted
bowâ€™r
where
the
nightingale
grieves
then
no
more
they
dance
till
her
sad
song
is
done
but
silent
as
the
night
to
her
mourning
attend
and
often
as
her
dying
notes
their
pity
have
won
they
vow
all
her
sacred
haunts
from
mortals
to
defend
when
down
among
the
mountains
sinks
the
evâ€™ning
star
and
the
changing
moon
forsakes
this
shadowy
sphere
how
cheerless
would
they
be
thoâ€™
they
fairies
are
if
i
with
my
pale
light
came
not
near
yet
cheerless
thoâ€™
theyâ€™d
be
theyâ€™re
ungrateful
to
my
love
for
often
when
the
travellerâ€™s
benighted
on
his
way
and
i
glimmer
in
his
path
and
would
guide
him
throâ€™
the
grove
they
bind
me
in
their
magic
spells
to
lead
him
far
astray
and
in
the
mire
to
leave
him
till
the
stars
are
all
burnt
out
while
in
strange-looking
shapes
they
frisk
about
the
ground
and
afar
in
the
woods
they
raise
a
dismal
shout
till
i
shrink
into
my
cell
again
for
terror
of
the
sound
but
see
where
all
the
tiny
elves
come
dancing
in
a
ring
with
the
merry
merry
pipe
and
the
tabor
and
the
horn
and
the
timbrel
so
clear
and
the
lute
with
dulcet
string
then
round
about
the
oak
they
go
till
peeping
of
the
morn
down
yonder
glade
two
lovers
steal
to
shun
the
fairy-queen
who
frowns
upon
their
plighted
vows
and
jealous
is
of
me
that
yester-eve
i
lighted
them
along
the
dewy
green
to
seek
the
purple
flowâ€™r
whose
juice
from
all
her
spells
can
free
and
now
to
punish
me
she
keeps
afar
her
jocund
band
with
the
merry
merry
pipe
and
the
tabor
and
the
lute
if
i
creep
near
yonder
oak
she
will
wave
her
fairy
wand
and
to
me
the
dance
will
cease
and
the
music
all
be
mute
o
had
i
but
that
purple
flowâ€™r
whose
leaves
her
charms
can
foil
and
knew
like
fays
to
draw
the
juice
and
throw
it
on

be
her
slave

and
help
all
faithful
lovers
nor
fear
the
fairy
kind
but
soon
the
vapour
of
the
woods
will
wander
afar
and
the
fickle
moon
will
fade
and
the
stars
disappear
then
cheerless
will
they
be
thoâ€™
they
fairies
are
if
i

whatever
st

might
think
of
the
stanzas
he
would
not
deny
his
daughter
the
pleasure
of
believing
that
he
approved
them
and
having
given
his
commendation
he
sunk
into
a
reverie
and
they
walked
on
in
silence
a
faint
erroneous
ray
glancâ€™d
from
thâ€™
imperfect
surfaces
of
things
flung
half
an
image
on
the
straining
eye

and

and

and
mountain-tops
that
long
retain
the
ascending
gleam

all
one
swimming
scene
uncertain
if
beheld
thomson
st
aubert
continued
silent
till
he
reached
the
chã¢teau
where
his
wife
had
retired
to
her
chamber
the
languor
and
dejection
that
had
lately
oppressed
her
and
which
the
exertion
called
forth
by
the
arrival
of
her
guests
had
suspended
now
returned
with
increased
effect
on
the
following
day
symptoms
of
fever
appeared
and
st
aubert
having
sent
for
medical
advice
learned
that
her
disorder
was
a
fever
of
the
same
nature
as
that
from
which
he
had
lately
recovered
she
had
indeed
taken
the
infection
during
her
attendance
upon
him
and
her
constitution
being
too
weak
to
throw
out
the
disease
immediately
it
had
lurked
in
her
veins
and
occasioned
the
heavy
languor
of
which
she
had
complained
st
aubert
whose
anxiety
for
his
wife
overcame
every
other
consideration
detained
the
physician
in
his
house
he
remembered
the
feelings
and
the
reflections
that
had
called
a
momentary
gloom
upon
his
mind
on
the
day
when
he
had
last
visited
the
fishing-house
in
company
with
madame
st
aubert
and
he
now
admitted
a
presentiment
that
this
illness
would
be
a
fatal
one
but
he
effectually
concealed
this
from
her
and
from
his
daughter
whom
he
endeavoured
to
reanimate
with
hopes
that
her
constant
assiduities
would
not
be
unavailing
the
physician
when
asked
by
st
aubert
for
his
opinion
of
the
disorder
replied
that
the
event
of
it
depended
upon
circumstances
which
he
could
not
ascertain
madame
st
aubert
seemed
to
have
formed
a
more
decided
one
but
her
eyes
only
gave
hints
of
this
she
frequently
fixed
them
upon
her
anxious
friends
with
an
expression
of
pity
and
of
tenderness
as
if
she
anticipated
the
sorrow
that
awaited
them
and
that
seemed
to
say
it
was
for
their
sakes
only
for
their
sufferings
that
she
regretted
life
on
the
seventh
day
the
disorder
was
at
its
crisis
the
physician
assumed
a
graver
manner
which
she
observed
and
took
occasion
when
her
family
had
once
quitted
the
chamber
to
tell
him
that
she
perceived
her
death
was
approaching
â€œdo
not
attempt
to
deceive
meâ€
said
she
â€œi
feel
that
i
cannot
long
survive
i
am
prepared
for
the
event
i
have
long
i
hope
been
preparing
for
it
since
i
have
not
long
to
live
do
not
suffer
a
mistaken
compassion
to
induce
you
to
flatter
my
family
with
false
hopes
if
you
do
their
affliction
will
only
be
the
heavier
when
it
arrives
i
will
endeavour
to
teach
them
resignation
by
my
exampleâ€
the
physician
was
affected
he
promised
to
obey
her
and
told
st
aubert
somewhat
abruptly
that
there
was
nothing
to
expect
the
latter
was
not
philosopher
enough
to
restrain
his
feelings
when
he
received
this
information
but
a
consideration
of
the
increased
affliction
which
the
observance
of
his
grief
would
occasion
his
wife
enabled
him
after
some
time
to
command
himself
in
her
presence
emily
was
at
first
overwhelmed
with
the
intelligence
then
deluded
by
the
strength
of
her
wishes
a
hope
sprung
up
in
her
mind
that
her
mother
would
yet
recover
and
to
this
she
pertinaciously
adhered
almost
to
the
last
hour
the
progress
of
this
disorder
was
marked
on
the
side
of
madame
st
aubert
by
patient
suffering
and
subjected
wishes
the
composure
with
which
she
awaited
her
death
could
be
derived
only
from
the
retrospect
of
a
life
governed
as
far
as
human
frailty
permits
by
a
consciousness
of
being
always
in
the
presence
of
the
deity
and
by
the
hope
of
a
higher
world
but
her
piety
could
not
entirely
subdue
the
grief
of
parting
from
those
whom
she
so
dearly
loved
during
these
her
last
hours
she
conversed
much
with
st
aubert
and
emily
on
the
prospect
of
futurity
and
on
other
religious
topics
the
resignation
she
expressed
with
the
firm
hope
of
meeting
in
a
future
world
the
friends
she
left
in
this
and
the
effort
which
sometimes
appeared
to
conceal
her
sorrow
at
this
temporary
separation
frequently
affected
st
aubert
so
much
as
to
oblige
him
to
leave
the
room
having
indulged
his
tears
a
while
he
would
dry
them
and
return
to
the
chamber
with
a
countenance
composed
by
an
endeavour
which
did
but
increase
his
grief
never
had
emily
felt
the
importance
of
the
lessons
which
had
taught
her
to
restrain
her
sensibility
so
much
as
in
these
moments
and
never
had
she
practised
them
with
a
triumph
so
complete
but
when
the
last
was
over
she
sunk
at
once
under
the
pressure
of
her
sorrow
and
then
perceived
that
it
was
hope
as
well
as
fortitude
which
had
hitherto
supported
her
st
aubert
was
for
a
time
too
devoid
of
comfort
himself
to
bestow
any
on
his
daughter
i
could
a
tale
unfold
whose
lightest
word
would
harrow
up
thy
soul
shakespeare
madame
st
aubert
was
interred
in
the
neighbouring
village
church
her
husband
and
daughter
attended
her
to
the
grave
followed
by
a
long
train
of
the
peasantry
who
were
sincere
mourners
of
this
excellent
woman
on
his
return
from
the
funeral
st
aubert
shut
himself
in
his
chamber
when
he
came
forth
it
was
with
a
serene
countenance
though
pale
in
sorrow
he
gave
orders
that
his
family
should
attend
him
emily
only
was
absent
who
overcome
with
the
scene
she
had
just
witnessed
had
retired
to
her
closet
to
weep
alone
st
aubert
followed
her
thither
he
took
her
hand
in
silence
while
she
continued
to
weep
and
it
was
some
moments
before
he
could
so
far
command
his
voice
as
to
speak
it
trembled
while
he
said
â€œmy
emily
i
am
going
to
prayers
with
my
family
you
will
join
us
we
must
ask
support
from
above
where
else
ought
we
to
seek
itâ€”where
else
can
we
find
itâ€
emily
checked
her
tears
and
followed
her
father
to
the
parlour
where
the
servants
being
assembled
st
aubert
read
in
a
low
and
solemn
voice
the
evening
service
and
added
a
prayer
for
the
soul
of
the
departed
during
this
his
voice
often
faltered
his
tears
fell
upon
the
book
and
at
length
he
paused
but
the
sublime
emotions
of
pure
devotion
gradually
elevated
his
views
above
this
world
and
finally
brought
comfort
to
his
heart
when
the
service
was
ended
and
the
servants
were
withdrawn
he
tenderly
kissed
emily
and
said
â€œi
have
endeavoured
to
teach
you
from
your
earliest
youth
the
duty
of
self-command
i
have
pointed
out
to
you
the
great
importance
of
it
through
life
not
only
as
it
preserves
us
in
the
various
and
dangerous
temptations
that
call
us
from
rectitude
and
virtue
but
as
it
limits
the
indulgences
which
are
termed
virtuous
yet
which
extended
beyond
a
certain
boundary
are
vicious
for
their
consequence
is
evil
all
excess
is
vicious
even
that
sorrow
which
is
amiable
in
its
origin
becomes
a
selfish
and
unjust
passion
if
indulged
at
the
expence
of
our
dutiesâ€”by
our
duties
i
mean
what
we
owe
to
ourselves
as
well
as
to
others
the
indulgence
of
excessive
grief
enervates
the
mind
and
almost
incapacitates
it
for
again
partaking
of
those
various
innocent
enjoyments
which
a
benevolent
god
designed
to
be
the
sunshine
of
our
lives
my
dear
emily
recollect
and
practise
the
precepts
i
have
so
often
given
you
and
which
your
own
experience
has
so
often
shown
you
to
be
wise
â€œyour
sorrow
is
useless
do
not
receive
this
as
merely
a
commonplace
remark
but
let
reason
therefore
restrain
sorrow
i
would
not
annihilate
your
feelings
my
child
i
would
only
teach
you
to
command
them
for
whatever
may
be
the
evils
resulting
from
a
too
susceptible
heart
nothing
can
be
hoped
from
an
insensible
one
that
on
the
other
hand
is
all
viceâ€”vice
of
which
the
deformity
is
not
softened
or
the
effect
consoled
for
by
any
semblance
or
possibility
of
good
you
know
my
sufferings
and
are
therefore
convinced
that
mine
are
not
the
light
words
which
on
these
occasions
are
so
often
repeated
to
destroy
even
the
sources
of
honest
emotion
or
which
merely
display
the
selfish
ostentation
of
a
false
philosophy
i
will
show
my
emily
that
i
can
practise
what
i
advise
i
have
said
thus
much
because
i
cannot
bear
to
see
you
wasting
in
useless
sorrow
for
want
of
that
resistance
which
is
due
from
mind
and
i
have
not
said
it
till
now
because
there
is
a
period
when
all
reasoning
must
yield
to
nature
that
is
past
and
another
when
excessive
indulgence
having
sunk
into
habit
weighs
down
the
elasticity
of
the
spirits
so
as
to
render
conquest
nearly
impossible
this
is
to
come
you
my
emily
will
show
that
you
are
willing
to
avoid
itâ€
emily
smiled
through
her
tears
upon
her
father
â€œdear
sirâ€
said
she
and
her
voice
trembled
she
would
have
added
â€œi
will
show
myself
worthy
of
being
your
daughterâ€
but
a
mingled
emotion
of
gratitude
affection
and
grief
overcame
her
st
aubert
suffered
her
to
weep
without
interruption
and
then
began
to
talk
on
common
topics
the
first
person
who
came
to
condole
with
st
aubert
was
a
m
barreaux
an
austere
and
seemingly
unfeeling
man
a
taste
for
botany
had
introduced
them
to
each
other
for
they
had
frequently
met
in
their
wanderings
among
the
mountains
m
barreaux
had
retired
from
the
world
and
almost
from
society
to
live
in
a
pleasant
chã¢teau
on
the
skirts
of
the
woods
near
la
vallã©e
he
also
had
been
disappointed
in
his
opinion
of
mankind
but
he
did
not
like
st
aubert
pity
and
mourn
for
them
he
felt
more
indignation
at
their
vices
than
compassion
for
their
weaknesses
st
aubert
was
somewhat
surprised
to
see
him
for
though
he
had
often
pressed
him
to
come
to
the
chã¢teau
he
had
never
till
now
accepted
the
invitation
and
now
he
came
without
ceremony
or
reserve
entering
the
parlour
as
an
old
friend
the
claims
of
misfortune
appeared
to
have
softened
down
all
the
ruggedness
and
prejudices
of
his
heart
st
aubert
unhappy
seemed
to
be
the
sole
idea
that
occupied
his
mind
it
was
in
manners
more
than
in
words
that
he
appeared
to
sympathise
with
his
friends
he
spoke
little
on
the
subject
of
their
grief
but
the
minute
attention
he
gave
them
and
the
modulated
voice
and
softened
look
that
accompanied
it
came
from
his
heart
and
spoke
to
theirs
at
this
melancholy
period
st
aubert
was
likewise
visited
by
madame
cheron
his
only
surviving
sister
who
had
been
some
years
a
widow
and
now
resided
on
her
own
estate
near
thoulouse
the
intercourse
between
them
had
not
been
very
frequent
in
her
condolements
words
were
not
wanting
she
understood
not
the
magic
of
the
look
that
speaks
at
once
to
the
soul
or
the
voice
that
sinks
like
balm
to
the
heart
but
she
assured
st
aubert
that
she
sincerely
sympathised
with
him
praised
the
virtues
of
his
late
wife
and
then
offered
what
she
considered
to
be
consolation
emily
wept
unceasingly
while
she
spoke
st
aubert
was
tranquil
listened
to
what
she
said
in
silence
and
then
turned
the
discourse
upon
another
subject
at
parting
she
pressed
him
and
her
niece
to
make
her
an
early
visit
â€œchange
of
place
will
amuse
youâ€
said
she
â€œand
it
is
wrong
to
give
way
to
griefâ€
st
aubert
acknowledged
the
truth
of
these
words
of
course
but
at
the
same
time
felt
more
reluctant
than
ever
to
quit
the
spot
which
his
past
happiness
had
consecrated
the
presence
of
his
wife
had
sanctified
every
surrounding
scene
and
each
day
as
it
gradually
softened
the
acuteness
of
his
suffering
assisted
the
tender
enchantment
that
bound
him
to
home
but
there
were
calls
which
must
be
complied
with
and
of
this
kind
was
the
visit
he
paid
to
his
brother-in-law
m
quesnel
an
affair
of
an
interesting
nature
made
it
necessary
that
he
should
delay
this
visit
no
longer
and
wishing
to
rouse
emily
from
her
dejection
he
took
her
with
him
to
epourville
as
the
carriage
entered
upon
the
forest
that
adjoined
his
paternal
domain
his
eyes
once
more
caught
between
the
chesnut
avenue
the
turreted
corners
of
the
chã¢teau
he
sighed
to
think
of
what
had
passed
since
he
was
last
there
and
that
it
was
now
the
property
of
a
man
who
neither
revered
nor
valued
it
at
length
he
entered
the
avenue
whose
lofty
trees
had
so
often
delighted
him
when
a
boy
and
whose
melancholy
shade
was
now
so
congenial
with
the
tone
of
his
spirits
every
feature
of
the
edifice
distinguished
by
an
air
of
heavy
grandeur
appeared
successively
between
the
branches
of
the
treesâ€”the
broad
turret
the
arched
gateway
that
led
into
the
courts
the
drawbridge
and
the
dry
fossã©
which
surrounded
the
whole
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
brought
a
troop
of
servants
to
the
great
gate
where
st
aubert
alighted
and
from
which
he
led
emily
into
the
gothic
hall
now
no
longer
hung
with
the
arms
and
ancient
banners
of
the
family
these
were
displaced
and
the
oak
wainscotting
and
beams
that
crossed
the
roof
were
painted
white
the
large
table
too
that
used
to
stretch
along
the
upper
end
of
the
hall
where
the
master
of
the
mansion
loved
to
display
his
hospitality
and
whence
the
peal
of
laughter
and
the
song
of
conviviality
had
so
often
resounded
was
now
removed
even
the
benches
that
had
surrounded
the
hall
were
no
longer
there
the
heavy
walls
were
hung
with
frivolous
ornaments
and
everything
that
appeared
denoted
the
false
taste
and
corrupted
sentiments
of
the
present
owner
st
aubert
followed
a
gay
parisian
servant
to
a
parlour
where
sat
mons
and
madame
quesnel
who
received
him
with
a
stately
politeness
and
after
a
few
formal
words
of
condolement
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
they
ever
had
a
sister
emily
felt
tears
swell
into
her
eyes
and
then
resentment
checked
them
st
aubert
calm
and
deliberate
preserved
his
dignity
without
assuming
importance
and
quesnel
was
depressed
by
his
presence
without
exactly
knowing
wherefore
after
some
general
conversation
st
aubert
requested
to
speak
with
him
alone
and
emily
being
left
with
madame
quesnel
soon
learned
that
a
large
party
was
invited
to
dine
at
the
chã¢teau
and
was
compelled
to
hear
that
nothing
which
was
past
and
irremediable
ought
to
prevent
the
festivity
of
the
present
hour
st
aubert
when
he
was
told
that
company
were
expected
felt
a
mixed
emotion
of
disgust
and
indignation
against
the
insensibility
of
quesnel
which
prompted
him
to
return
home
immediately
but
he
was
informed
that
madame
cheron
had
been
asked
to
meet
him
and
when
he
looked
at
emily
and
considered
that
a
time
might
come
when
the
enmity
of
her
uncle
would
be
prejudicial
to
her
he
determined
not
to
incur
it
himself
by
conduct
which
would
be
resented
as
indecorous
by
the
very
persons
who
now
showed
so
little
sense
of
decorum
among
the
visitors
assembled
at
dinner
were
two
italian
gentlemen
of
whom
one
was
named
montoni
a
distant
relation
of
madame
quesnel
a
man
about
forty
of
an
uncommonly
handsome
person
with
features
manly
and
expressive
but
whose
countenance
exhibited
upon
the
whole
more
of
the
haughtiness
of
command
and
the
quickness
of
discernment
than
of
any
other
character
signor
cavigni
his
friend
appeared
to
be
about
thirtyâ€”inferior
in
dignity
but
equal
to
him
in
penetration
of
countenance
and
superior
in
insinuation
of
manner
emily
was
shocked
by
the
salutation
with
which
madame
cheron
met
her
fatherâ€”â€œdear
brotherâ€
said
she
â€œi
am
concerned
to
see
you
look
so
very
ill
do
pray
have
adviceâ€
st
aubert
answered
with
a
melancholy
smile
that
he
felt
himself
much
as
usual
but
emilyâ€™s
fears
made
her
now
fancy
that
her
father
looked
worse
than
he
really
did
emily
would
have
been
amused
by
the
new
characters
she
saw
and
the
varied
conversation
that
passed
during
dinner
which
was
served
in
a
style
of
splendour
she
had
seldom
seen
before
had
her
spirits
been
less
oppressed
of
the
guests
signor
montoni
was
lately
come
from
italy
and
he
spoke
of
the
commotions
which
at
that
period
agitated
the
country
talked
of
party
differences
with
warmth
and
then
lamented
the
probable
consequences
of
the
tumults
his
friend
spoke
with
equal
ardour
of
the
politics
of
his
country
praised
the
government
and
prosperity
of
venice
and
boasted
of
its
decided
superiority
over
all
the
other
italian
states
he
then
turned
to
the
ladies
and
talked
with
the
same
eloquence
of
parisian
fashions
the
french
opera
and
french
manners
and
on
the
latter
subject
he
did
not
fail
to
mingle
what
is
so
particularly
agreeable
to
french
taste
the
flattery
was
not
detected
by
those
to
whom
it
was
addressed
though
its
effect
in
producing
submissive
attention
did
not
escape
his
observation
when
he
could
disengage
himself
from
the
assiduities
of
the
other
ladies
he
sometimes
addressed
emily
but
she
knew
nothing
of
parisian
fashions
or
parisian
operas
and
her
modesty
simplicity
and
correct
manners
formed
a
decided
contrast
to
those
of
her
female
companions
after
dinner
st
aubert
stole
from
the
room
to
view
once
more
the
old
chesnut
which
quesnel
talked
of
cutting
down
as
he
stood
under
its
shade
and
looked
up
among
its
branches
still
luxuriant
and
saw
here
and
there
the
blue
sky
trembling
between
them
the
pursuits
and
events
of
his
early
days
crowded
fast
to
his
mind
with
the
figures
and
characters
of
friendsâ€”long
since
gone
from
the
earth
and
he
now
felt
himself
to
be
almost
an
insulated
being
with
nobody
but
his
emily
for
his
heart
to
turn
to
he
stood
lost
amid
the
scenes
of
years
which
fancy
called
up
till
the
succession
closed
with
the
picture
of
his
dying
wife
and
he
started
away
to
forget
it
if
possible
at
the
social
board
st
aubert
ordered
his
carriage
at
an
early
hour
and
emily
observed
that
he
was
more
than
usually
silent
and
dejected
on
the
way
home
but
she
considered
this
to
be
the
effect
of
his
visit
to
a
place
which
spoke
so
eloquently
of
former
times
nor
suspected
that
he
had
a
cause
of
grief
which
he
concealed
from
her
on
entering
the
chã¢teau
she
felt
more
depressed
than
ever
for
she
more
than
ever
missed
the
presence
of
that
dear
parent
who
whenever
she
had
been
from
home
used
to
welcome
her
return
with
smiles
and
fondness
now
all
was
silent
and
forsaken
but
what
reason
and
effort
may
fail
to
do
time
effects
week
after
week
passed
away
and
each
as
it
passed
stole
something
from
the
harshness
of
her
affliction
till
it
was
mellowed
to
that
tenderness
which
the
feeling
heart
cherishes
as
sacred
st
aubert
on
the
contrary
visibly
declined
in
health
though
emily
who
had
been
so
constantly
with
him
was
almost
the
last
person
who
observed
it
his
constitution
had
never
recovered
from
the
late
attack
of
the
fever
and
the
succeeding
shock
it
received
from
madame
st
aubertâ€™s
death
had
produced
its
present
infirmity
his
physician
now
ordered
him
to
travel
for
it
was
perceptible
that
sorrow
had
seized
upon
his
nerves
weakened
as
they
had
been
by
the
preceding
illness
and
variety
of
scene
it
was
probable
would
by
amusing
his
mind
restore
them
to
their
proper
tone
for
some
days
emily
was
occupied
in
preparations
to
attend
him
and
he
by
endeavours
to
diminish
his
expences
at
home
during
the
journeyâ€”a
purpose
which
determined
him
at
length
to
dismiss
his
domestics
emily
seldom
opposed
her
fatherâ€™s
wishes
by
questions
or
remonstrances
or
she
would
now
have
asked
why
he
did
not
take
a
servant
and
have
represented
that
his
infirm
health
made
one
almost
necessary
but
when
on
the
eve
of
their
departure
she
found
that
he
had
dismissed
jacques
francis
and
mary
and
detained
only
theresa
the
old
housekeeper
she
was
extremely
surprised
and
ventured
to
ask
his
reason
for
having
done
so
â€œto
save
expences
my
dearâ€
he
repliedâ€”â€œwe
are
going
on
an
expensive
excursionâ€
the
physician
had
prescribed
the
air
of
languedoc
and
provence
and
st
aubert
determined
therefore
to
travel
leisurely
along
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
towards
provence
they
retired
early
to
their
chamber
on
the
night
before
their
departure
but
emily
had
a
few
books
and
other
things
to
collect
and
the
clock
had
struck
twelve
before
she
had
finished
or
had
remembered
that
some
of
her
drawing
instruments
which
she
meant
to
take
with
her
were
in
the
parlour
below
as
she
went
to
fetch
these
she
passed
her
fatherâ€™s
room
and
perceiving
the
door
half
open
concluded
that
he
was
in
his
studyâ€”for
since
the
death
of
madame
st
aubert
it
had
been
frequently
his
custom
to
rise
from
his
restless
bed
and
go
thither
to
compose
his
mind
when
she
was
below
stairs
she
looked
into
this
room
but
without
finding
him
and
as
she
returned
to
her
chamber
she
tapped
at
his
door
and
receiving
no
answer
stepped
softly
in
to
be
certain
whether
he
was
there
the
room
was
dark
but
a
light
glimmered
through
some
panes
of
glass
that
were
placed
in
the
upper
part
of
a
closet-door
emily
believed
her
father
to
be
in
the
closet
and
surprised
that
he
was
up
at
so
late
an
hour
apprehended
he
was
unwell
and
was
going
to
enquire
but
considering
that
her
sudden
appearance
at
this
hour
might
alarm
him
she
removed
her
light
to
the
staircase
and
then
stepped
softly
to
the
closet
on
looking
through
the
panes
of
glass
she
saw
him
seated
at
a
small
table
with
papers
before
him
some
of
which
he
was
reading
with
deep
attention
and
interest
during
which
he
often
wept
and
sobbed
aloud
emily
who
had
come
to
the
door
to
learn
whether
her
father
was
ill
was
now
detained
there
by
a
mixture
of
curiosity
and
tenderness
she
could
not
witness
his
sorrow
without
being
anxious
to
know
the
subject
of
and
she
therefore
continued
to
observe
him
in
silence
concluding
that
those
papers
were
letters
of
her
late
mother
presently
he
knelt
down
and
with
a
look
so
solemn
as
she
had
seldom
seen
him
assume
and
which
was
mingled
with
a
certain
wild
expression
that
partook
more
of
horror
than
of
any
other
character
he
prayed
silently
for
a
considerable
time
when
he
rose
a
ghastly
paleness
was
on
his
countenance
emily
was
hastily
retiring
but
she
saw
him
turn
again
to
the
papers
and
she
stopped
he
took
from
among
them
a
small
case
and
from
thence
a
miniature
picture
the
rays
of
light
fell
strongly
upon
it
and
she
perceived
it
to
be
that
of
a
lady
but
not
of
her
mother
st
aubert
gazed
earnestly
and
tenderly
upon
his
portrait
put
it
to
his
lips
and
then
to
his
heart
and
sighed
with
a
convulsive
force
emily
could
scarcely
believe
what
she
saw
to
be
real
she
never
knew
till
now
that
he
had
a
picture
of
any
other
lady
than
her
mother
much
less
that
he
had
one
which
he
evidently
valued
so
highly
but
having
looked
repeatedly
to
be
certain
that
it
was
not
the
resemblance
of
madame
st
aubert
she
became
entirely
convinced
that
it
was
designed
for
that
of
some
other
person
at
length
st
aubert
returned
the
picture
to
its
case
and
emily
recollecting
that
she
was
intruding
upon
his
private
sorrows
softly
withdrew
from
the
chamber
o
how
canst
thou
renounce
the
boundless
store
of
charms
which
nature
to
her
votâ€™ry
yields
the
warbling
woodland
the
resounding
shore
the
pomp
of
groves
and
garniture
of
fields
all
that
the
genial
ray
of
morning
gilds
and
all
that
echoes
to
the
song
of
even
all
that
the
mountainâ€™s
sheltâ€™ring
bosom
shields
and
all
the
dread
magnificence
of
heaven
o
how
canst
thou
renounce
and
hope
to
be
forgiven

these
charms
shall
work
thy
soulâ€™s
eternal
health
and
love
and
gentleness
and
joy
impart
the
minstrel
st
aubert
instead
of
taking
the
more
direct
road
that
ran
along
the
feet
of
the
pyrenees
to
languedoc
chose
one
that
winding
over
the
heights
afforded
more
extensive
views
and
greater
variety
of
romantic
scenery
he
turned
a
little
out
of
his
way
to
take
leave
of
m
barreaux
whom
he
found
botanizing
in
the
wood
near
his
chã¢teau
and
who
when
he
was
told
the
purpose
of
st
aubertâ€™s
visit
expressed
a
degree
of
concern
such
as
his
friend
had
thought
it
was
scarcely
possible
for
him
to
feel
on
any
similar
occasion
they
parted
with
mutual
regret
â€œif
anything
could
have
tempted
me
from
my
retirementâ€
said
m
barreaux
â€œit
would
have
been
the
pleasure
of
accompanying
you
on
this
little
tour
i
do
not
often
offer
compliments
you
may
therefore
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
shall
look
for
your
return
with
impatienceâ€
the
travellers
proceeded
on
their
journey
as
they
ascended
the
heights
st
aubert
often
looked
back
upon
the
chã¢teau
in
the
plain
below
tender
images
crowded
to
his
mind
his
melancholy
imagination
suggested
that
he
should
return
no
more
and
though
he
checked
this
wandering
thought
still
he
continued
to
look
till
the
haziness
of
distance
blended
his
home
with
the
general
landscape
and
st
aubert
seemed
to
drag
at
each
remove
a
lengthening
chain
he
and
emily
continued
sunk
in
musing
silence
for
some
leagues
from
which
melancholy
reverie
emily
first
awoke
and
her
young
fancy
struck
with
the
grandeur
of
the
objects
around
gradually
yielded
to
delightful
impressions
the
road
now
descended
into
glens
confined
by
stupendous
walls
of
rock
grey
and
barren
except
where
shrubs
fringed
their
summits
or
patches
of
meagre
vegetation
tinted
their
recesses
in
which
the
wild
goat
was
frequently
browsing
and
now
the
way
led
to
the
lofty
cliffs
from
whence
the
landscape
was
seen
extending
in
all
its
magnificence
emily
could
not
restrain
her
transport
as
she
looked
over
the
pine
forests
of
the
mountains
upon
the
vast
plains
that
enriched
with
woods
towns
blushing
vines
and
plantations
of
almonds
palms
and
olives
stretched
along
till
their
various
colours
melted
in
distance
into
one
harmonious
hue
that
seemed
to
unite
earth
with
heaven
through
the
whole
of
this
glorious
scene
the
majestic
garonne
wandered
descending
from
its
source
among
the
pyrenees
and
winding
its
blue
waves
towards
the
bay
of
biscay
the
ruggedness
of
the
unfrequented
road
often
obliged
the
wanderers
to
alight
from
their
little
carriage
but
they
thought
themselves
amply
repaid
for
this
inconvenience
by
the
grandeur
of
the
scenes
and
while
the
muleteer
led
his
animals
slowly
over
the
broken
ground
the
travellers
had
leisure
to
linger
amid
these
solitudes
and
to
indulge
the
sublime
reflections
which
soften
while
they
elevate
the
heart
and
fill
it
with
the
certainty
of
a
present
god
still
the
enjoyment
of
st
aubert
was
touched
with
that
pensive
melancholy
which
gives
to
every
object
a
mellower
tint
and
breathes
a
sacred
charm
over
all
around
they
had
provided
against
part
of
the
evil
to
be
encountered
from
a
want
of
convenient
inns
by
carrying
a
stock
of
provisions
in
the
carriage
so
that
they
might
take
refreshment
on
any
pleasant
spot
in
the
open
air
and
pass
the
nights
wherever
they
should
happen
to
meet
with
a
comfortable
cottage
for
the
mind
also
they
had
provided
by
a
work
on
botany
written
by
m
barreaux
and
by
several
of
the
latin
and
italian
poets
while
emilyâ€™s
pencil
enabled
her
to
preserve
some
of
those
combinations
of
forms
which
charmed
her
at
every
step
the
loneliness
of
the
road
where
only
now
and
then
a
peasant
was
seen
driving
his
mule
or
some
mountaineer-children
at
play
among
the
rocks
heightened
the
effect
of
the
scenery
st
aubert
was
so
much
struck
with
it
that
he
determined
if
he
could
hear
of
a
road
to
penetrate
further
among
the
mountains
and
bending
his
way
rather
more
to
the
south
to
emerge
into
rousillon
and
coast
the
mediterranean
along
part
of
that
country
to
languedoc
soon
after
mid-day
they
reached
the
summit
of
one
of
those
cliffs
which
bright
with
the
verdure
of
palm-trees
adorn
like
gems
the
tremendous
walls
of
the
rocks
and
which
overlooked
the
greater
part
of
gascony
and
part
of
languedoc
here
was
shade
and
the
fresh
water
of
a
spring
that
gliding
among
the
turf
under
the
trees
thence
precipitated
itself
from
rock
to
rock
till
its
dashing
murmurs
were
lost
in
the
abyss
though
its
white
foam
was
long
seen
amid
the
darkness
of
the
pines
below
this
was
a
spot
well
suited
for
rest
and
the
travellers
alighted
to
dine
while
the
mules
were
unharnessed
to
browse
on
the
savoury
herbs
that
enriched
this
summit
it
was
some
time
before
st
aubert
or
emily
could
withdraw
their
attention
from
the
surrounding
objects
so
as
to
partake
of
their
little
repast
seated
in
the
shade
of
the
palms
st
aubert
pointed
out
to
her
observation
the
course
of
the
rivers
the
situation
of
great
towns
and
the
boundaries
of
provinces
which
science
rather
than
the
eye
enabled
him
to
describe
notwithstanding
this
occupation
when
he
had
talked
awhile
he
suddenly
became
silent
thoughtful
and
tears
often
swelled
to
his
eyes
which
emily
observed
and
the
sympathy
of
her
own
heart
told
her
their
cause
the
scene
before
them
bore
some
resemblance
though
it
was
on
a
much
grander
scale
to
a
favourite
one
of
the
late
madame
st
aubert
within
view
of
the
fishing-house
they
both
observed
this
and
thought
how
delighted
she
would
have
been
with
the
present
landscape
while
they
knew
that
her
eyes
must
never
never
more
open
upon
this
world
st
aubert
remembered
the
last
time
of
his
visiting
that
spot
in
company
with
her
and
also
the
mournfully
presaging
thoughts
which
had
then
arisen
in
his
mind
and
were
now
even
thus
soon
realised
the
recollections
subdued
him
and
he
abruptly
rose
from
his
seat
and
walked
away
to
where
no
eye
could
observe
his
grief
when
he
returned
his
countenance
had
recovered
its
usual
serenity
he
took
emilyâ€™s
hand
pressed
it
affectionately
without
speaking
and
soon
after
called
to
the
muleteer
who
sat
at
a
little
distance
concerning
a
road
among
the
mountains
towards
rousillon
michael
said
there
were
several
that
way
but
he
did
not
know
how
far
they
extended
or
even
whether
they
were
passable
and
st
aubert
who
did
not
intend
to
travel
after
sunset
asked
what
village
they
could
reach
about
that
time
the
muleteer
calculated
that
they
could
easily
reach
mateau
which
was
in
their
present
road
but
that
if
they
took
a
road
that
sloped
more
to
the
south
towards
rousillon
there
was
a
hamlet
which
he
thought
they
could
gain
before
the
evening
shut
in
st
aubert
after
some
hesitation
determined
to
take
the
latter
course
and
michael
having
finished
his
meal
and
harnessed
his
mules
again
set
forward
but
soon
stopped
and
st
aubert
saw
him
doing
homage
to
a
cross
that
stood
on
a
rock
impending
over
their
way
having
concluded
his
devotions
he
smacked
his
whip
in
the
air
and
in
spite
of
the
rough
road
and
the
pain
of
his
poor
mules
which
he
had
been
lately
lamenting
rattled
in
a
full
gallop
along
the
edge
of
a
precipice
which
it
made
the
eye
dizzy
to
look
down
emily
was
terrified
almost
to
fainting
and
st
aubert
apprehending
still
greater
danger
from
suddenly
stopping
the
driver
was
compelled
to
sit
quietly
and
trust
his
fate
to
the
strength
and
discretion
of
the
mules
who
seemed
to
possess
a
greater
portion
of
the
latter
quality
than
their
master
for
they
carried
the
travellers
safely
into
the
valley
and
there
stopped
upon
the
brink
of
the
rivulet
that
watered
it
leaving
the
splendour
of
extensive
prospects
they
now
entered
this
narrow
valley
screened
by
rocks
on
rocks
piled
as
if
by
magic
spell
here
scorchâ€™d
by
lightnings
there
with
ivy
green
the
scene
of
barrenness
was
here
and
there
interrupted
by
the
spreading
branches
of
the
larch
and
cedar
which
threw
their
gloom
over
the
cliff
or
athwart
the
torrent
that
rolled
in
the
vale
no
living
creature
appeared
except
the
lizard
scrambling
among
the
rocks
and
often
hanging
upon
points
so
dangerous
that
fancy
shrunk
from
the
view
of
them
this
was
such
a
scene
as
salvator
would
have
chosen
had
he
then
existed
for
his
canvas
st
aubert
impressed
by
the
romantic
character
of
the
place
almost
expected
to
see
banditti
start
from
behind
some
projecting
rock
and
he
kept
his
hand
upon
the
arms
with
which
he
always
travelled
as
they
advanced
the
valley
opened
its
savage
features
gradually
softened
and
towards
evening
they
were
among
heathy
mountains
stretched
in
far
perspective
along
which
the
solitary
sheep-bell
was
heard
and
the
voice
of
the
shepherd
calling
his
wandering
flocks
to
the
nightly
fold
his
cabin
partly
shadowed
by
the
cork-tree
and
the
ilex
which
st
aubert
observed
to
flourish
in
higher
regions
of
the
air
than
any
other
trees
except
the
fir
was
all
the
human
habitation
that
yet
appeared
along
the
bottom
of
this
valley
the
most
vivid
verdure
was
spread
and
in
the
little
hollow
recesses
of
the
mountains
under
the
shade
of
the
oak
and
chestnut
herds
of
cattle
were
grazing
groups
of
them
too
were
often
seen
reposing
on
the
banks
of
the
rivulet
or
laving
their
sides
in
the
cool
stream
and
sipping
its
wave
the
sun
was
now
setting
upon
the
valley
its
last
light
gleamed
upon
the
water
and
heightened
the
rich
yellow
and
purple
tints
of
the
heath
and
broom
that
overspread
the
mountains
st
aubert
enquired
of
michael
the
distance
to
the
hamlet
he
had
mentioned
but
the
man
could
not
with
certainty
tell
and
emily
began
to
fear
that
he
had
mistaken
the
road
here
was
no
human
being
to
assist
or
direct
them
they
had
left
the
shepherd
and
his
cabin
far
behind
and
the
scene
became
so
obscured
in
twilight
that
the
eye
could
not
follow
the
distant
perspective
of
the
valley
in
search
of
a
cottage
or
a
hamlet
a
glow
of
the
horizon
still
marked
the
west
and
this
was
of
some
little
use
to
the
travellers
michael
seemed
endeavouring
to
keep
up
his
courage
by
singing
his
music
however
was
not
of
a
kind
to
disperse
melancholy
he
sung
in
a
sort
of
chant
one
of
the
most
dismal
ditties
his
present
auditors
had
ever
heard
and
st
aubert
at
length
discovered
it
to
be
a
vesper-hymn
to
his
favourite
saint
they
travelled
on
sunk
in
that
thoughtful
melancholy
with
which
twilight
and
solitude
impress
the
mind
michael
had
now
ended
his
ditty
and
nothing
was
heard
but
the
drowsy
murmur
of
the
breeze
among
the
woods
and
its
light
flutter
as
it
blew
freshly
into
the
carriage
they
were
at
length
roused
by
the
sound
of
fire-arms
st
aubert
called
to
the
muleteer
to
stop
and
they
listened
the
noise
was
not
repeated
but
presently
they
heard
a
rustling
among
the
brakes
st
aubert
drew
forth
a
pistol
and
ordered
michael
to
proceed
as
fast
as
possible
who
had
not
long
obeyed
before
a
horn
sounded
that
made
the
mountains
ring
he
looked
again
from
the
window
and
then
saw
a
young
man
spring
from
the
bushes
into
the
road
followed
by
a
couple
of
dogs
the
stranger
was
in
a
hunterâ€™s
dress
his
gun
was
slung
across
his
shoulders
the
hunterâ€™s
horn
hung
from
his
belt
and
in
his
hand
was
a
small
pike
which
as
he
held
it
added
to
the
manly
grace
of
his
figure
and
assisted
the
agility
of
his
steps
after
a
momentâ€™s
hesitation
st
aubert
again
stopped
the
carriage
and
waited
till
he
came
up
that
they
might
enquire
concerning
the
hamlet
they
were
in
search
of
the
stranger
informed
him
that
it
was
only
half
a
league
distant
that
he
was
going
thither
himself
and
would
readily
show
the
way
st
aubert
thanked
him
for
the
offer
and
pleased
with
his
chevalier-like
air
and
open
countenance
asked
him
to
take
a
seat
in
the
carriage
which
the
stranger
with
an
acknowledgment
declined
adding
that
he
would
keep
pace
with
the
mules
â€œbut
i
fear
you
will
be
wretchedly
accommodatedâ€
said
he
â€œthe
inhabitants
of
these
mountains
are
a
simple
people
who
are
not
only
without
the
luxuries
of
life
but
almost
destitute
of
what
in
other
places
are
held
to
be
its
necessariesâ€
â€œi
perceive
you
are
not
one
of
its
inhabitants
sirâ€
said
st
aubert
â€œno
sir
i
am
only
a
wanderer
hereâ€
the
carriage
drove
on
and
the
increasing
dusk
made
the
travellers
very
thankful
that
they
had
a
guide
the
frequent
glens
too
that
now
opened
among
the
mountains
would
likewise
have
added
to
their
perplexity
emily
as
she
looked
up
one
of
these
saw
something
at
a
great
distance
like
a
bright
cloud
in
the
air
â€œwhat
light
is
yonder
sirâ€
said
she
st
aubert
looked
and
perceived
that
it
was
the
snowy
summit
of
a
mountain
so
much
higher
than
any
around
it
that
it
still
reflected
the
sunâ€™s
rays
while
those
below
lay
in
deep
shade
at
length
the
village
lights
were
seen
to
twinkle
through
the
dusk
and
soon
after
some
cottages
were
discovered
in
the
valley
or
rather
were
seen
by
reflection
in
the
stream
on
whose
margin
they
stood
and
which
still
gleamed
with
the
evening
light
the
stranger
now
came
up
and
st
aubert
on
further
enquiry
found
not
only
that
there
was
no
inn
in
the
place
but
not
any
sort
of
house
of
public
reception
the
stranger
however
offered
to
walk
on
and
enquire
for
a
cottage
to
accommodate
them
for
which
further
civility
st
aubert
returned
his
thanks
and
said
that
as
the
village
was
so
near
he
would
alight
and
walk
with
him
emily
followed
slowly
in
the
carriage
on
the
way
st
aubert
asked
his
companion
what
success
he
had
had
in
the
chase
â€œnot
much
sirâ€
he
replied
â€œnor
do
i
aim
at
it
i
am
pleased
with
the
country
and
mean
to
saunter
away
a
few
weeks
among
its
scenes
my
dogs
i
take
with
me
more
for
companionship
than
for
game
this
dress
too
gives
me
an
ostensible
business
and
procures
me
that
respect
from
the
people
which
would
perhaps
be
refused
to
a
lonely
stranger
who
had
no
visible
motive
for
coming
among
themâ€
â€œi
admire
your
tasteâ€
said
st
aubert
â€œand
if
i
was
a
younger
man
should
like
to
pass
a
few
weeks
in
your
way
exceedingly
i
too
am
a
wanderer
but
neither
my
plan
nor
pursuits
are
exactly
like
yoursâ€”i
go
in
search
of
health
as
much
as
of
amusementâ€
st
aubert
sighed
and
paused
and
then
seeming
to
recollect
himself
he
resumed
â€œif
i
can
hear
of
a
tolerable
road
that
shall
afford
decent
accommodation
it
is
my
intention
to
pass
into
rousillon
and
along
the
sea-shore
to
languedoc
you
sir
seem
to
be
acquainted
with
the
country
and
can
perhaps
give
me
information
on
the
subjectâ€
the
stranger
said
that
what
information
he
could
give
was
entirely
at
his
service
and
then
mentioned
a
road
rather
more
to
the
east
which
led
to
a
town
whence
it
would
be
easy
to
proceed
into
rousillon
they
now
arrived
at
the
village
and
commenced
their
search
for
a
cottage
that
would
afford
a
nightâ€™s
lodging
in
several
which
they
entered
ignorance
poverty
and
mirth
seemed
equally
to
prevail
and
the
owners
eyed
st
aubert
with
a
mixture
of
curiosity
and
timidity
nothing
like
a
bed
could
be
found
and
he
had
ceased
to
enquire
for
one
when
emily
joined
him
who
observed
the
languor
of
her
fatherâ€™s
countenance
and
lamented
that
he
had
taken
a
road
so
ill
provided
with
the
comforts
necessary
for
an
invalid
other
cottages
which
they
examined
seemed
somewhat
less
savage
than
the
former
consisting
of
two
rooms
if
such
they
could
be
called
the
first
of
these
occupied
by
mules
and
pigs
the
second
by
the
family
which
generally
consisted
of
six
or
eight
children
with
their
parents
who
slept
on
beds
of
skins
and
dried
beech
leaves
spread
upon
a
mud
floor
here
light
was
admitted
and
smoke
discharged
through
an
aperture
in
the
roof
and
here
the
scent
of
spirits
for
the
travelling
smugglers
who
haunted
the
pyrenees
had
made
this
rude
people
familiar
with
the
use
of
liquors
was
generally
perceptible
enough
emily
turned
from
such
scenes
and
looked
at
her
father
with
anxious
tenderness
which
the
young
stranger
seemed
to
observe
for
drawing
st
aubert
aside
he
made
him
an
offer
of
his
own
bed
â€œit
is
a
decent
oneâ€
said
he
â€œwhen
compared
with
what
we
have
just
seen
yet
such
as
in
other
circumstances
i
should
be
ashamed
to
offer
youâ€
st
aubert
acknowledged
how
much
he
felt
himself
obliged
by
this
kindness
but
refused
to
accept
it
till
the
young
stranger
would
take
no
denial
â€œdo
not
give
me
the
pain
of
knowing
sirâ€
said
he
â€œthat
an
invalid
like
you
lies
on
hard
skins
while
i
sleep
in
a
bed
besides
sir
your
refusal
wounds
my
pride
i
must
believe
you
think
my
offer
unworthy
your
acceptance
let
me
show
you
the
way
i
have
no
doubt
my
landlady
can
accommodate
this
young
lady
alsoâ€
st
aubert
at
length
consented
that
if
this
could
be
done
he
would
accept
his
kindness
though
he
felt
rather
surprised
that
the
stranger
had
proved
himself
so
deficient
in
gallantry
as
to
administer
to
the
repose
of
an
infirm
man
rather
than
to
that
of
a
very
lovely
young
woman
for
he
had
not
once
offered
the
room
for
emily
but
she
thought
not
of
herself
and
the
animated
smile
she
gave
him
told
how
much
she
felt
herself
obliged
for
the
preference
of
her
father
on
their
way
the
stranger
whose
name
was
valancourt
stepped
on
first
to
speak
to
his
hostess
and
she
came
out
to
welcome
st
aubert
into
a
cottage
much
superior
to
any
he
had
seen
this
good
woman
seemed
very
willing
to
accommodate
the
strangers
who
were
soon
compelled
to
accept
the
only
two
beds
in
the
place
eggs
and
milk
were
the
only
food
the
cottage
afforded
but
against
scarcity
of
provisions
st
aubert
had
provided
and
he
requested
valancourt
to
stay
and
partake
with
him
of
less
homely
fare
an
invitation
which
was
readily
accepted
and
they
passed
an
hour
in
intelligent
conversation
st
aubert
was
much
pleased
with
the
manly
frankness
simplicity
and
keen
susceptibility
to
the
grandeur
of
nature
which
his
new
acquaintance
discovered
and
indeed
he
had
often
been
heard
to
say
that
without
a
certain
simplicity
of
heart
this
taste
could
not
exist
in
any
strong
degree
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
violent
uproar
without
in
which
the
voice
of
the
muleteer
was
heard
above
every
other
sound
valancourt
started
from
his
seat
and
went
to
enquire
the
occasion
but
the
dispute
continued
so
long
afterwards
that
st
aubert
went
himself
and
found
michael
quarrelling
with
the
hostess
because
she
had
refused
to
let
his
mules
lie
in
a
little
room
where
he
and
three
of
her
sons
were
to
pass
the
night
the
place
was
wretched
enough
but
there
was
no
other
for
these
people
to
sleep
in
and
with
somewhat
more
of
delicacy
than
was
usual
among
the
inhabitants
of
this
wild
tract
of
country
she
persisted
in
refusing
to
let
the
animals
have
the
same
bed-chamber
with
her
children
this
was
a
tender
point
with
the
muleteer
his
honour
was
wounded
when
his
mules
were
treated
with
disrespect
and
he
would
have
received
a
blow
perhaps
with
more
meekness
he
declared
that
his
beasts
were
as
honest
beasts
and
as
good
beasts
as
any
in
the
whole
province
and
that
they
had
a
right
to
be
well
treated
wherever
they
went
â€œthey
are
as
harmless
as
lambsâ€
said
he
â€œif
people
donâ€™t
affront
them
i
never
knew
them
behave
themselves
amiss
above
once
or
twice
in
my
life
and
then
they
had
good
reason
for
doing
so
once
indeed
they
kicked
at
a
boyâ€™s
leg
that
lay
asleep
in
the
stable
and
broke
it
but
i
told
them
they
were
out
there
and
by
st
anthony
i
believe
they
understood
me
for
they
never
did
so
againâ€
he
concluded
this
eloquent
harangue
with
protesting
that
they
should
share
with
him
go
where
he
would
the
dispute
was
at
length
settled
by
valancourt
who
drew
the
hostess
aside
and
desired
she
would
let
the
muleteer
and
his
beasts
have
the
place
in
question
to
themselves
while
her
sons
should
have
the
bed
of
skins
designed
for
him
for
that
he
would
wrap
himself
in
his
cloak
and
sleep
on
the
bench
by
the
cottage
door
but
this
she
thought
it
her
duty
to
oppose
and
she
felt
it
to
be
her
inclination
to
disappoint
the
muleteer
valancourt
however
was
positive
and
the
tedious
affair
was
at
length
settled
it
was
late
when
st
aubert
and
emily
retired
to
their
rooms
and
valancourt
to
his
station
at
the
door
which
at
this
mild
season
he
preferred
to
a
close
cabin
and
a
bed
of
skins
st
aubert
was
somewhat
surprised
to
find
in
his
room
volumes
of
homer
horace
and
petrarch
but
the
name
of
valancourt
written
in
them
told
him
to
whom
they
belonged
in
truth
he
was
a
strange
and
wayward
wight
fond
of
each
gentle
and
each
dreadful
scene
in
darkness
and
in
storm
he
found
delight
nor
less
than
when
on
ocean-wave
serene
the
southern
sun
diffusâ€™d
his
dazzling
sheen
even
sad
vicissitude
amusâ€™d
his
soul
and
if
a
sigh
would
sometimes
intervene
and
down
his
cheek
a
tear
of
pity
roll
a
sigh
a
tear
so
sweet
he
wishâ€™d
not
to
control
the
minstrel
st
aubert
awoke
at
an
early
hour
refreshed
by
sleep
and
desirous
to
set
forward
he
invited
the
stranger
to
breakfast
with
him
and
talking
again
of
the
road
valancourt
said
that
some
months
past
he
had
travelled
as
far
as
beaujeu
which
was
a
town
of
some
consequence
on
the
way
to
rousillon
he
recommended
it
to
st
aubert
to
take
that
route
and
the
latter
determined
to
do
so
â€œthe
road
from
this
hamletâ€
said
valancourt
â€œand
that
to
beaujeu
part
at
the
distance
of
about
a
league
and
a
half
from
hence
if
you
will
give
me
leave
i
will
direct
your
muleteer
so
far
i
must
wander
somewhere
and
your
company
would
make
this
a
pleasanter
ramble
than
any
other
i
could
takeâ€
st
aubert
thankfully
accepted
his
offer
and
they
set
out
together
the
young
stranger
on
foot
for
he
refused
the
invitation
of
st
aubert
to
take
a
seat
in
his
little
carriage
the
road
wound
along
the
feet
of
the
mountains
through
a
pastoral
valley
bright
with
verdure
and
varied
with
groves
of
dwarf
oak
beech
and
sycamore
under
whose
branches
herds
of
cattle
reposed
the
mountain-ash
too
and
the
weeping
birch
often
threw
their
pendant
foliage
over
the
steeps
above
where
the
scanty
soil
scarcely
concealed
their
roots
and
where
their
light
branches
waved
to
every
breeze
that
fluttered
from
the
mountains
the
travellers
were
frequently
met
at
this
early
hour
for
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
upon
the
valley
by
shepherds
driving
immense
flocks
from
their
folds
to
feed
upon
the
hills
st
aubert
had
set
out
thus
early
not
only
that
he
might
enjoy
the
first
appearance
of
sunrise
but
that
he
might
inhale
the
first
pure
breath
of
morning
which
above
all
things
is
refreshing
to
the
spirits
of
the
invalid
in
these
regions
it
was
particularly
so
where
an
abundance
of
wild
flowers
and
aromatic
herbs
breathed
forth
their
essence
on
the
air
the
dawn
which
softened
the
scenery
with
its
peculiar
grey
tint
now
dispersed
and
emily
watched
the
progress
of
the
day
first
trembling
on
the
tops
of
the
highest
cliffs
then
touching
them
with
splendid
light
while
their
sides
and
the
vale
below
were
still
wrapt
in
dewy
mist
meanwhile
the
sullen
grey
of
the
eastern
clouds
began
to
blush
then
to
redden
and
then
to
glow
with
a
thousand
colours
till
the
golden
light
darted
over
all
the
air
touched
the
lower
points
of
the
mountainâ€™s
brow
and
glanced
in
long
sloping
beams
upon
the
valley
and
its
stream
all
nature
seemed
to
have
awakened
from
death
into
life
the
spirit
of
st
aubert
was
renovated
his
heart
was
full
he
wept
and
his
thoughts
ascended
to
the
great
creator
emily
wished
to
trip
along
the
turf
so
green
and
bright
with
dew
and
to
taste
the
full
delight
of
that
liberty
which
the
izard
seemed
to
enjoy
as
he
bounded
along
the
brow
of
the
cliffs
while
valancourt
often
stopped
to
speak
with
the
travellers
and
with
social
feeling
to
point
out
to
them
the
peculiar
objects
of
his
admiration
st
aubert
was
pleased
with
him
â€œhere
is
the
real
ingenuousness
and
ardour
of
youthâ€
said
he
to
himself
â€œthis
young
man
has
never
been
at
parisâ€
he
was
sorry
when
they
came
to
the
spot
where
the
roads
parted
and
his
heart
took
a
more
affectionate
leave
of
him
than
is
usual
after
so
short
an
acquaintance
valancourt
talked
long
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
seemed
more
than
once
to
be
going
but
still
lingered
and
appeared
to
search
anxiously
for
topics
of
conversation
to
account
for
his
delay
at
length
he
took
leave
as
he
went
st
aubert
observed
him
look
with
an
earnest
and
pensive
eye
at
emily
who
bowed
to
him
with
a
countenance
full
of
timid
sweetness
while
the
carriage
drove
on
st
aubert
for
whatever
reason
soon
after
looked
from
the
window
and
saw
valancourt
standing
upon
the
bank
of
the
road
resting
on
his
pike
with
folded
arms
and
following
the
carriage
with
his
eyes
he
waved
his
hand
and
valancourt
seeming
to
awake
from
his
reverie
returned
the
salute
and
started
away
the
aspect
of
the
country
now
began
to
change
and
the
travellers
soon
found
themselves
among
mountains
covered
from
their
base
nearly
to
their
summits
with
forests
of
gloomy
pine
except
where
a
rock
of
granite
shot
up
from
the
vale
and
lost
its
snowy
top
in
the
clouds
the
rivulet
which
had
hitherto
accompanied
them
now
expanded
into
a
river
and
flowing
deeply
and
silently
along
reflected
as
in
a
mirror
the
blackness
of
the
impending
shades
sometimes
a
cliff
was
seen
lifting
its
bold
head
above
the
woods
and
the
vapours
that
floated
mid-way
down
the
mountains
and
sometimes
a
face
of
perpendicular
marble
rose
from
the
waterâ€™s
edge
over
which
the
larch
threw
his
gigantic
arms
here
scathed
with
lightning
and
there
floating
in
luxuriant
foliage
they
continued
to
travel
over
a
rough
and
unfrequented
road
seeing
now
and
then
at
a
distance
the
solitary
shepherd
with
his
dog
stalking
along
the
valley
and
hearing
only
the
dashing
of
torrents
which
the
woods
concealed
from
the
eye
the
long
sullen
murmur
of
the
breeze
as
it
swept
over
the
pines
or
the
notes
of
the
eagle
and
the
vulture
which
were
seen
towering
round
the
beetling
cliff
often
as
the
carriage
moved
slowly
over
uneven
ground
st
aubert
alighted
and
amused
himself
with
examining
the
curious
plants
that
grew
on
the
banks
of
the
road
and
with
which
these
regions
abound
while
emily
wrapt
in
high
enthusiasm
wandered
away
under
the
shades
listening
in
deep
silence
to
the
lonely
murmur
of
the
woods
neither
village
nor
hamlet
was
seen
for
many
leagues
the
goat-herdâ€™s
or
the
hunterâ€™s
cabin
perched
among
the
cliffs
of
the
rocks
were
the
only
human
habitations
that
appeared
the
travellers
again
took
their
dinner
in
the
open
air
on
a
pleasant
spot
in
the
valley
under
the
spreading
shade
of
cedars
and
then
set
forward
towards
beaujeu
the
road
now
began
to
descend
and
leaving
the
pine
forests
behind
wound
among
rocky
precipices
the
evening
twilight
again
fell
over
the
scene
and
the
travellers
were
ignorant
how
far
they
might
yet
be
from
beaujeu
st
aubert
however
conjectured
that
the
distance
could
not
be
very
great
and
comforted
himself
with
the
prospect
of
travelling
on
a
more
frequented
road
after
reaching
that
town
where
he
designed
to
pass
the
night
mingled
woods
and
rocks
and
heathy
mountains
were
now
seen
obscurely
through
the
dusk
but
soon
even
these
imperfect
images
faded
in
darkness
michael
proceeded
with
caution
for
he
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
road
his
mules
however
seemed
to
have
more
sagacity
and
their
steps
were
sure
on
turning
the
angle
of
a
mountain
a
light
appeared
at
a
distance
that
illumined
the
rocks
and
the
horizon
to
a
great
extent
it
was
evidently
a
large
fire
but
whether
accidental
or
otherwise
there
were
no
means
of
knowing
st
aubert
thought
it
was
probably
kindled
by
some
of
the
numerous
banditti
that
infested
the
pyrenees
and
he
became
watchful
and
anxious
to
know
whether
the
road
passed
near
this
fire
he
had
arms
with
him
which
on
an
emergency
might
afford
some
protection
though
certainly
a
very
unequal
one
against
a
band
of
robbers
so
desperate
too
as
those
usually
were
who
haunted
these
wild
regions
while
many
reflections
rose
upon
his
mind
he
heard
a
voice
shouting
from
the
road
behind
and
ordering
the
muleteer
to
stop
st
aubert
bade
him
proceed
as
fast
as
possible
but
either
michael
or
his
mules
were
obstinate
for
they
did
not
quit
the
old
pace
horsesâ€™
feet
were
now
heard
a
man
rode
up
to
the
carriage
still
ordering
the
driver
to
stop
and
st
aubert
who
could
no
longer
doubt
his
purpose
was
with
difficulty
able
to
prepare
a
pistol
for
his
defence
when
his
hand
was
upon
the
door
of
the
chaise
the
man
staggered
on
his
horse
the
report
of
the
pistol
was
followed
by
a
groan
and
st
aubertâ€™s
horror
may
be
imagined
when
in
the
next
instant
he
thought
he
heard
the
faint
voice
of
valancourt
he
now
himself
bade
the
muleteer
stop
and
pronouncing
the
name
of
valancourt
was
answered
in
a
voice
that
no
longer
suffered
him
to
doubt
st
aubert
who
instantly
alighted
and
went
to
his
assistance
found
him
still
sitting
on
his
horse
but
bleeding
profusely
and
appearing
to
be
in
great
pain
though
he
endeavoured
to
soften
the
terror
of
st
aubert
by
assurances
that
he
was
not
materially
hurt
the
wound
being
only
in
his
arm
st
aubert
with
the
muleteer
assisted
him
to
dismount
and
he
sat
down
on
the
bank
of
the
road
where
st
aubert
tried
to
bind
up
his
arm
but
his
hands
trembled
so
excessively
that
he
could
not
accomplish
it
and
michael
being
now
gone
in
pursuit
of
the
horse
which
on
being
disengaged
from
his
rider
had
galloped
off
he
called
emily
to
his
assistance
receiving
no
answer
he
went
to
the
carriage
and
found
her
sunk
on
the
seat
in
a
fainting
fit
between
the
distress
of
this
circumstance
and
that
of
leaving
valancourt
bleeding
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
did
he
endeavoured
however
to
raise
her
and
called
to
michael
to
fetch
water
from
the
rivulet
that
flowed
by
the
road
but
michael
was
gone
beyond
the
reach
of
his
voice
valancourt
who
heard
these
calls
and
also
the
repeated
name
of
emily
instantly
understood
the
subject
of
his
distress
and
almost
forgetting
his
own
condition
he
hastened
to
her
relief
she
was
reviving
when
he
reached
the
carriage
and
then
understanding
that
anxiety
for
him
had
occasioned
her
indisposition
he
assured
her
in
a
voice
that
trembled
but
not
from
anguish
that
his
wound
was
of
no
consequence
while
he
said
this
st
aubert
turned
round
and
perceiving
that
he
was
still
bleeding
the
subject
of
his
alarm
changed
again
and
he
hastily
formed
some
handkerchiefs
into
a
bandage
this
stopped
the
effusion
of
the
blood
but
st
aubert
dreading
the
consequence
of
the
wound
enquired
repeatedly
how
far
they
were
from
beaujeu
when
learning
that
it
was
at
two
leaguesâ€™
distance
his
distress
increased
since
he
knew
not
how
valancourt
in
his
present
state
would
bear
the
motion
of
the
carriage
and
perceived
that
he
was
already
faint
from
loss
of
blood
when
he
mentioned
the
subject
of
his
anxiety
valancourt
entreated
that
he
would
not
suffer
himself
to
be
thus
alarmed
on
his
account
for
that
he
had
no
doubt
he
should
be
able
to
support
himself
very
well
and
then
he
talked
of
the
accident
as
a
slight
one
the
muleteer
being
now
returned
with
valancourtâ€™s
horse
assisted
him
into
the
chaise
and
as
emily
was
now
revived
they
moved
slowly
on
towards
beaujeu
st
aubert
when
he
had
recovered
from
the
terror
occasioned
him
by
this
accident
expressed
surprise
on
seeing
valancourt
who
explained
his
unexpected
appearance
by
saying
â€œyou
sir
renewed
my
taste
for
society
when
you
had
left
the
hamlet
it
did
indeed
appear
a
solitude
i
determined
therefore
since
my
object
was
merely
amusement
to
change
the
scene
and
i
took
this
road
because
i
knew
it
led
through
a
more
romantic
tract
of
mountains
than
the
spot
i
have
left
besidesâ€
added
he
hesitating
for
an
instant
â€œi
will
own
and
why
should
i
not
that
i
had
some
hope
of
overtaking
youâ€
â€œand
i
have
made
you
a
very
unexpected
return
for
the
complimentâ€
said
st
aubert
who
lamented
again
the
rashness
which
had
produced
the
accident
and
explained
the
cause
of
his
late
alarm
but
valancourt
seemed
anxious
only
to
remove
from
the
minds
of
his
companions
every
unpleasant
feeling
relative
to
himself
and
for
that
purpose
still
struggled
against
a
sense
of
pain
and
tried
to
converse
with
gaiety
emily
meanwhile
was
silent
except
when
valancourt
particularly
addressed
her
and
there
was
at
those
times
a
tremulous
tone
in
his
voice
that
spoke
much
they
were
now
so
near
the
fire
which
had
long
flamed
at
a
distance
on
the
blackness
of
night
that
it
gleamed
upon
the
road
and
they
could
distinguish
figures
moving
about
the
blaze
the
way
winding
still
nearer
they
perceived
in
the
valley
one
of
those
numerous
bands
of
gipsies
which
at
that
period
particularly
haunted
the
wilds
of
the
pyrenees
and
lived
partly
by
plundering
the
traveller
emily
looked
with
some
degree
of
terror
on
the
savage
countenances
of
these
people
shown
by
the
fire
which
heightened
the
romantic
effects
of
the
scenery
as
it
threw
a
red
dusky
gleam
upon
the
rocks
and
on
the
foliage
of
the
trees
leaving
heavy
masses
of
shade
and
regions
of
obscurity
which
the
eye
feared
to
penetrate
they
were
preparing
their
supper
a
large
pot
stood
by
the
fire
over
which
several
figures
were
busy
the
blaze
discovered
a
rude
kind
of
tent
round
which
many
children
and
dogs
were
playing
and
the
whole
formed
a
picture
highly
grotesque
the
travellers
saw
plainly
their
danger
valancourt
was
silent
but
laid
his
hand
on
one
of
st
aubertâ€™s
pistols
st
aubert
drew
forth
another
and
michael
was
ordered
to
proceed
as
fast
as
possible
they
passed
the
place
however
without
being
attacked
the
rovers
being
probably
unprepared
for
the
opportunity
and
too
busy
about
their
supper
to
feel
much
interest
at
the
moment
in
anything
besides
after
a
league
and
a
half
more
passed
in
darkness
the
travellers
arrived
at
beaujeu
and
drove
up
to
the
only
inn
the
place
afforded
which
though
superior
to
any
they
had
seen
since
they
entered
the
mountains
was
bad
enough
the
surgeon
of
the
town
was
immediately
sent
for
if
a
surgeon
he
could
be
called
who
prescribed
for
horses
as
well
as
for
men
and
shaved
faces
at
least
as
dexterously
as
he
set
bones
after
examining
valancourtâ€™s
arm
and
perceiving
that
the
bullet
had
passed
through
the
flesh
without
touching
the
bone
he
dressed
it
and
left
him
with
a
solemn
prescription
of
quiet
which
his
patient
was
not
inclined
to
obey
the
delight
of
ease
had
now
succeeded
to
pain
for
ease
may
be
allowed
to
assume
a
positive
quality
when
contrasted
with
anguish
and
his
spirits
thus
reanimated
he
wished
to
partake
of
the
conversation
of
st
aubert
and
emily
who
released
from
so
many
apprehensions
were
uncommonly
cheerful
late
as
it
was
however
st
aubert
was
obliged
to
go
out
with
the
landlord
to
buy
meat
for
supper
and
emily
who
during
this
interval
had
been
absent
as
long
as
she
could
upon
excuses
of
looking
to
their
accommodation
which
she
found
rather
better
than
she
expected
was
compelled
to
return
and
converse
with
valancourt
alone
they
talked
of
the
character
of
the
scenes
they
had
passed
of
the
natural
history
of
the
country
of
poetry
and
of
st
aubert
a
subject
on
which
emily
always
spoke
and
listened
to
with
peculiar
pleasure
the
travellers
passed
an
agreeable
evening
but
st
aubert
was
fatigued
with
his
journey
and
as
valancourt
seemed
again
sensible
of
pain
they
separated
soon
after
supper
in
the
morning
st
aubert
found
that
valancourt
had
passed
a
restless
night
that
he
was
feverish
and
his
wound
very
painful
the
surgeon
when
he
dressed
it
advised
him
to
remain
quietly
at
beaujeu
advice
which
was
too
reasonable
to
be
rejected
st
aubert
however
had
no
favourable
opinion
of
this
practitioner
and
was
anxious
to
commit
valancourt
into
more
skilful
hands
but
learning
upon
enquiry
that
there
was
no
town
within
several
leagues
which
seemed
more
likely
to
afford
better
advice
he
altered
the
plan
of
his
journey
and
determined
to
await
the
recovery
of
valancourt
who
with
somewhat
more
ceremony
than
sincerity
made
many
objections
to
this
delay
by
order
of
his
surgeon
valancourt
did
not
go
out
of
the
house
that
day
but
st
aubert
and
emily
surveyed
with
delight
the
environs
of
the
town
situated
at
the
feet
of
the
pyrenean
alps
that
rose
some
in
abrupt
precipices
and
others
swelling
with
woods
of
cedar
fir
and
cypress
which
stretched
nearly
to
their
highest
summits
the
cheerful
green
of
the
beech
and
mountain-ash
was
sometimes
seen
like
a
gleam
of
light
amidst
the
dark
verdure
of
the
forest
and
sometimes
a
torrent
poured
its
sparkling
flood
high
among
the
woods
valancourtâ€™s
indisposition
detained
the
travellers
at
beaujeu
several
days
during
which
interval
st
aubert
had
observed
his
disposition
and
his
talents
with
the
philosophic
inquiry
so
natural
to
him
he
saw
a
frank
and
generous
nature
full
of
ardour
highly
susceptible
of
whatever
is
grand
and
beautiful
but
impetuous
wild
and
somewhat
romantic
valancourt
had
known
little
of
the
world
his
perceptions
were
clear
and
his
feelings
just
his
indignation
of
an
unworthy
or
his
admiration
of
a
generous
action
were
expressed
in
terms
of
equal
vehemence
st
aubert
sometimes
smiled
at
his
warmth
but
seldom
checked
it
and
often
repeated
to
himself
â€œthis
young
man
has
never
been
at
parisâ€
a
sigh
sometimes
followed
this
silent
ejaculation
he
determined
not
to
leave
valancourt
till
he
should
be
perfectly
recovered
and
as
he
was
now
well
enough
to
travel
though
not
able
to
manage
his
horse
st
aubert
invited
him
to
accompany
him
for
a
few
days
in
the
carriage
this
he
the
more
readily
did
since
he
had
discovered
that
valancourt
was
of
a
family
of
the
same
name
in
gascony
with
whose
respectability
he
was
well
acquainted
the
latter
accepted
the
offer
with
great
pleasure
and
they
again
set
forward
among
these
romantic
wilds
about
rousillon
they
travelled
leisurely
stopping
wherever
a
scene
uncommonly
grand
appeared
frequently
alighting
to
walk
to
an
eminence
whither
the
mules
could
not
go
from
which
the
prospect
opened
in
greater
magnificence
and
often
sauntering
over
hillocks
covered
with
lavender
wild
thyme
juniper
and
tamarisc
and
under
the
shades
of
woods
between
those
boles
they
caught
the
long
mountain-vista
sublime
beyond
anything
that
emily
had
ever
imagined
st
aubert
sometimes
amused
himself
with
botanizing
while
valancourt
and
emily
strolled
on
he
pointing
out
to
her
notice
the
objects
that
particularly
charmed
him
and
reciting
beautiful
passages
from
such
of
the
latin
and
italian
poets
as
he
had
heard
her
admire
in
the
pauses
of
conversation
when
he
thought
himself
not
observed
he
frequently
fixed
his
eyes
pensively
on
her
countenance
which
expressed
with
so
much
animation
the
taste
and
energy
of
her
mind
and
when
he
spoke
again
there
was
a
peculiar
tenderness
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
defeated
any
attempt
to
conceal
his
sentiments
by
degrees
these
silent
pauses
became
more
frequent
till
emily
only
betrayed
an
anxiety
to
interrupt
them
and
she
who
had
been
hitherto
reserved
would
now
talk
again
and
again
of
the
woods
and
the
valleys
and
the
mountains
to
avoid
the
danger
of
sympathy
and
silence
from
beaujeu
the
road
had
constantly
ascended
conducting
the
travellers
into
the
higher
regions
of
the
air
where
immense
glaciers
exhibited
their
frozen
horrors
and
eternal
snow
whitened
the
summits
of
the
mountains
they
often
paused
to
contemplate
these
stupendous
scenes
and
seated
on
some
wild
cliff
where
only
the
ilex
or
the
larch
could
flourish
looked
over
dark
forests
of
fir
and
precipices
where
human
foot
had
never
wandered
into
the
glenâ€”so
deep
that
the
thunder
of
the
torrent
which
was
seen
to
foam
along
the
bottom
was
scarcely
heard
to
murmur
over
these
crags
rose
others
of
stupendous
height
and
fantastic
shape
some
shooting
into
cones
others
impending
far
over
their
base
in
huge
masses
of
granite
along
whose
broken
ridges
was
often
lodged
a
weight
of
snow
that
trembling
even
to
the
vibration
of
a
sound
threatened
to
bear
destruction
in
its
course
to
the
vale
around
on
every
side
far
as
the
eye
could
penetrate
were
seen
only
forms
of
grandeurâ€”the
long
perspective
of
mountain-tops
tinged
with
ethereal
blue
or
white
with
snow
valleys
of
ice
and
forests
of
gloomy
fir
the
serenity
and
clearness
of
the
air
in
these
high
regions
were
particularly
delightful
to
the
travellers
it
seemed
to
inspire
them
with
a
finer
spirit
and
diffused
an
indescribable
complacency
over
their
minds
they
had
no
words
to
express
the
sublime
emotions
they
felt
a
solemn
expression
characterised
the
feelings
of
st
aubert
tears
often
came
to
his
eyes
and
he
frequently
walked
away
from
his
companions
valancourt
now
and
then
spoke
to
point
to
emilyâ€™s
notice
some
feature
of
the
scene
the
thinness
of
the
atmosphere
through
which
every
object
came
so
distinctly
to
the
eye
surprised
and
deluded
her
who
could
scarcely
believe
that
objects
which
appeared
so
near
were
in
reality
so
distant
the
deep
silence
of
these
solitudes
was
broken
only
at
intervals
by
the
scream
of
the
vultures
seen
cowering
round
some
cliff
below
or
by
the
cry
of
the
eagle
sailing
high
in
the
air
except
when
the
travellers
listened
to
the
hollow
thunder
that
sometimes
muttered
at
their
feet
while
above
the
deep
blue
of
the
heavens
was
unobscured
by
the
lightest
cloud
half
way
down
the
mountains
long
billows
of
vapour
were
frequently
seen
rolling
now
wholly
excluding
the
country
below
and
now
opening
and
partially
revealing
its
features
emily
delighted
to
observe
the
grandeur
of
these
clouds
as
they
changed
in
shape
and
tints
and
to
watch
their
various
effect
on
the
lower
world
whose
features
partly
veiled
were
continually
assuming
new
forms
of
sublimity
after
traversing
these
regions
for
many
leagues
they
began
to
descend
towards
rousillon
and
features
of
beauty
then
mingled
with
the
scene
yet
the
travellers
did
not
look
back
without
some
regret
to
the
sublime
objects
they
had
quitted
though
the
eye
fatigued
with
the
extension
of
its
powers
was
glad
to
repose
on
the
verdure
of
woods
and
pastures
that
now
hung
on
the
margin
of
the
river
below
to
view
again
the
humble
cottage
shaded
by
cedars
the
playful
group
of
mountaineer-children
and
the
flowery
nooks
that
appeared
among
the
hills
as
they
descended
they
saw
at
a
distance
on
the
right
one
of
the
grand
passes
of
the
pyrenees
into
spain
gleaming
with
its
battlements
and
towers
to
the
splendour
of
the
setting
rays
yellow
tops
of
woods
colouring
the
steeps
below
while
far
above
aspired
the
snowy
points
of
the
mountains
still
reflecting
a
rosy
hue
st
aubert
began
to
look
out
for
the
little
town
he
had
been
directed
to
by
the
people
of
beaujeu
and
where
he
meant
to
pass
the
night
but
no
habitation
yet
appeared
of
its
distance
valancourt
could
not
assist
him
to
judge
for
he
had
never
been
so
far
along
this
chain
of
alps
before
there
was
however
a
road
to
guide
them
and
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
it
was
the
right
one
for
since
they
had
left
beaujeu
there
had
been
no
variety
of
tracks
to
perplex
or
mislead
the
sun
now
gave
his
last
light
and
st
aubert
bade
the
muleteer
proceed
with
all
possible
dispatch
he
found
indeed
the
lassitude
of
illness
return
upon
him
after
a
day
of
uncommon
fatigue
both
of
body
and
mind
and
he
longed
for
repose
his
anxiety
was
not
soothed
by
observing
a
numerous
train
consisting
of
men
horses
and
loaded
mules
winding
down
the
steeps
of
an
opposite
mountain
appearing
and
disappearing
at
intervals
among
the
woods
so
that
its
numbers
could
not
be
judged
of
something
bright
like
arms
glanced
in
the
setting
ray
and
the
military
dress
was
distinguishable
upon
the
men
who
were
in
the
van
and
on
others
scattered
among
the
troop
that
followed
as
these
wound
into
the
vale
the
rear
of
the
party
emerged
from
the
woods
and
exhibited
a
band
of
soldiers
st
aubertâ€™s
apprehensions
now
subsided
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
train
before
him
consisted
of
smugglers
who
in
conveying
prohibited
goods
over
the
pyrenees
had
been
encountered
and
conquered
by
a
party
of
troops
the
travellers
had
lingered
so
long
among
the
sublimer
scenes
of
these
mountains
that
they
found
themselves
entirely
mistaken
in
their
calculation
that
they
could
reach
montigny
at
sunset
but
as
they
wound
along
the
valley
the
saw
on
a
rude
alpine
bridge
that
united
two
lofty
crags
of
the
glen
a
group
of
mountaineer-children
amusing
themselves
with
dropping
pebbles
into
a
torrent
below
and
watching
the
stones
plunge
into
the
water
that
threw
up
its
white
spray
high
in
the
air
as
it
received
them
and
returned
a
sullen
sound
which
the
echoes
of
the
mountains
prolonged
under
the
bridge
was
seen
a
perspective
of
the
valley
with
its
cataract
descending
among
the
rocks
and
a
cottage
on
a
cliff
overshadowed
with
pines
it
appeared
that
they
could
not
be
far
from
some
small
town
st
aubert
bade
the
muleteer
stop
and
then
called
to
the
children
to
enquire
if
he
was
near
montigny
but
the
distance
and
the
roaring
of
the
waters
would
not
suffer
his
voice
to
be
heard
and
the
crags
adjoining
the
bridge
were
of
such
tremendous
height
and
steepness
that
to
have
climbed
either
would
have
been
scarcely
practicable
to
a
person
unacquainted
with
the
ascent
st
aubert
therefore
did
not
waste
more
moments
in
delay
they
continued
to
travel
long
after
twilight
had
obscured
the
road
which
was
so
broken
that
now
thinking
it
safer
to
walk
than
to
ride
they
all
alighted
the
moon
was
rising
but
her
light
was
yet
too
feeble
to
assist
them
while
they
stepped
carefully
on
they
heard
the
vesper-bell
of
a
convent
the
twilight
would
not
permit
them
to
distinguish
anything
like
a
building
but
the
sounds
seemed
to
come
from
some
woods
that
overhung
an
acclivity
to
the
right
valancourt
proposed
to
go
in
search
of
this
convent
â€œif
they
will
not
accommodate
us
with
a
nightâ€™s
lodgingâ€
said
he
â€œthey
may
certainly
inform
us
how
far
we
are
from
montigny
and
direct
us
towards
itâ€
he
was
bounding
forward
without
waiting
st
aubertâ€™s
reply
when
the
latter
stopped
him
â€œi
am
very
wearyâ€
said
st
aubert
â€œand
wish
for
nothing
so
much
as
for
immediate
rest
we
will
all
go
to
the
convent
your
good
looks
would
defeat
our
purpose
but
when
they
see
mine
and
emilyâ€™s
exhausted
countenances
they
will
scarcely
deny
us
reposeâ€
as
he
said
this
he
took
emilyâ€™s
arm
within
his
and
telling
michael
to
wait
awhile
in
the
road
with
the
carriage
they
began
to
ascend
towards
the
woods
guided
by
the
bell
of
the
convent
his
steps
were
feeble
and
valancourt
offered
him
his
arm
which
he
accepted
the
moon
now
threw
a
faint
light
over
their
path
and
soon
after
enabled
them
to
distinguish
some
towers
rising
above
the
tops
of
the
woods
still
following
the
note
of
the
bell
they
entered
the
shade
of
those
woods
lighted
only
by
the
moonbeams
that
glided
down
between
the
leaves
and
threw
a
tremulous
uncertain
gleam
upon
the
steep
track
they
were
winding
the
gloom
and
the
silence
that
prevailed
except
when
the
bell
returned
upon
the
air
together
with
the
wildness
of
the
surrounding
scene
struck
emily
with
a
degree
of
fear
which
however
the
voice
and
conversation
of
valancourt
somewhat
repressed
when
they
had
been
some
time
ascending
st
aubert
complained
of
weariness
and
they
stopped
to
rest
upon
a
little
green
summit
where
the
trees
opened
and
admitted
the
moonlight
he
sat
down
upon
the
turf
between
emily
and
valancourt
the
bell
had
now
ceased
and
the
deep
repose
of
the
scene
was
undisturbed
by
any
sound
for
the
low
dull
murmur
of
some
distant
torrents
might
be
said
to
sooth
rather
than
to
interrupt
the
silence
before
them
extended
the
valley
they
had
quitted
its
rocks
and
woods
to
the
left
just
silvered
by
the
rays
formed
a
contrast
to
the
deep
shadow
that
involved
the
opposite
cliffs
whose
fringed
summits
only
were
tipped
with
light
while
the
distant
perspective
of
the
valley
was
lost
in
the
yellow
mist
of
moonlight
the
travellers
sat
for
some
time
wrapt
in
the
complacency
which
such
scenes
inspire
â€œthese
scenesâ€
said
valancourt
at
length
â€œsoften
the
heart
like
the
notes
of
sweet
music
and
inspire
that
delicious
melancholy
which
no
person
who
had
felt
it
once
would
resign
for
the
gayest
pleasures
they
waken
our
best
and
purest
feelings
disposing
us
to
benevolence
pity
and
friendship
those
whom
i
loveâ€”i
always
seem
to
love
more
in
such
an
hour
as
thisâ€
his
voice
trembled
and
he
paused
st
aubert
was
silent
emily
perceived
a
warm
tear
fall
upon
the
hand
he
held
she
knew
the
object
of
his
thoughts
hers
too
had
for
some
time
been
occupied
by
the
remembrance
of
her
mother
he
seemed
by
an
effort
to
rouse
himself
â€œyesâ€
said
he
with
a
half-suppressed
sigh
â€œthe
memory
of
those
we
loveâ€”of
times
for
ever
past
in
such
an
hour
as
this
steals
upon
the
mind
like
a
strain
of
distant
music
in
the
stillness
of
nightâ€”all
tender
and
harmonious
as
this
landscape
sleeping
in
the
mellow
moonlightâ€
after
the
pause
of
a
moment
st
aubert
added
â€œi
have
always
fancied
that
i
thought
with
more
clearness
and
precision
at
such
an
hour
than
at
any
other
and
that
heart
must
be
insensible
in
a
great
degree
that
does
not
soften
to
its
influence
but
many
such
there
areâ€
valancourt
sighed
â€œare
there
indeed
many
suchâ€
said
emily
â€œa
few
years
hence
my
emilyâ€
replied
st
aubert
â€œand
you
may
smile
at
the
recollection
of
that
questionâ€”if
you
do
not
weep
to
it
but
come
i
am
somewhat
refreshed
let
us
proceedâ€
having
emerged
from
the
woods
they
saw
upon
a
turfy
hillock
above
the
convent
of
which
they
were
in
search
a
high
wall
that
surrounded
it
led
them
to
an
ancient
gate
at
which
they
knocked
and
the
poor
monk
who
opened
it
conducted
them
into
a
small
adjoining
room
where
he
desired
they
would
wait
while
he
informed
the
superior
of
their
request
in
this
interval
several
friars
came
in
separately
to
look
at
them
and
at
length
the
first
monk
returned
and
they
followed
him
to
a
room
where
the
superior
was
sitting
in
an
arm-chair
with
a
large
folio
volume
printed
in
black
letter
open
on
a
desk
before
him
he
received
them
with
courtesy
though
he
did
not
rise
from
his
seat
and
having
asked
them
a
few
questions
granted
their
request
after
a
short
conversation
formal
and
solemn
on
the
part
of
the
superior
they
withdrew
to
the
apartment
where
they
were
to
sup
and
valancourt
whom
one
of
the
inferior
friars
civilly
desired
to
accompany
went
to
seek
michael
and
his
mules
they
had
not
descended
half
way
down
the
cliffs
before
they
heard
the
voice
of
the
muleteer
echoing
far
and
wide
sometimes
he
called
on
st
aubert
and
sometimes
on
valancourt
who
having
at
length
convinced
him
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
either
for
himself
or
his
master
and
having
disposed
of
him
for
the
night
in
a
cottage
on
the
skirts
of
the
woods
returned
to
sup
with
his
friends
on
such
sober
fare
as
the
monks
thought
it
prudent
to
set
before
them
while
st
aubert
was
too
much
indisposed
to
share
it
emily
in
her
anxiety
for
her
father
forgot
herself
and
valancourt
silent
and
thoughtful
yet
never
inattentive
to
them
appeared
particularly
solicitous
to
accommodate
and
relieve
st
aubert
who
often
observed
while
his
daughter
was
pressing
him
to
eat
or
adjusting
the
pillow
she
had
placed
in
the
back
of
his
arm-chair
that
valancourt
fixed
on
her
a
look
of
pensive
tenderness
which
he
was
not
displeased
to
understand
they
separated
at
an
early
hour
and
retired
to
their
respective
apartments
emily
was
shown
to
hers
by
a
nun
of
the
convent
whom
she
was
glad
to
dismiss
for
her
heart
was
melancholy
and
her
attention
so
much
abstracted
that
conversation
with
a
stranger
was
painful
she
thought
her
father
daily
declining
and
attributed
his
present
fatigue
more
to
the
feeble
state
of
his
frame
than
to
the
difficulty
of
the
journey
a
train
of
gloomy
ideas
haunted
her
mind
till
she
fell
asleep
in
about
two
hours
after
she
was
awakened
by
the
chiming
of
a
bell
and
then
heard
quick
steps
pass
along
the
gallery
into
which
her
chamber
opened
she
was
so
little
accustomed
to
the
manners
of
a
convent
as
to
be
alarmed
by
this
circumstance
her
fears
ever
alive
for
her
father
suggested
that
he
was
very
ill
and
she
rose
in
haste
to
go
to
him
having
paused
however
to
let
the
persons
in
the
gallery
pass
before
she
opened
her
door
her
thoughts
in
the
mean
time
recovered
from
the
confusion
of
sleep
and
she
understood
that
the
bell
was
the
call
of
the
monks
to
prayers
it
had
now
ceased
and
all
being
again
still
she
forbore
to
go
to
st
aubertâ€™s
room
her
mind
was
not
disposed
for
immediate
sleep
and
the
moonlight
that
shone
into
her
chamber
invited
her
to
open
the
casement
and
look
out
upon
the
country
it
was
a
still
and
beautiful
night
the
sky
was
unobscured
by
any
cloud
and
scarce
a
leaf
of
the
woods
beneath
trembled
in
the
air
as
she
listened
the
midnight
hymn
of
the
monks
rose
softly
from
a
chapel
that
stood
on
one
of
the
lower
cliffs
a
holy
strain
that
seemed
to
ascend
through
the
silence
of
night
to
heaven
and
her
thoughts
ascended
with
it
from
the
consideration
of
his
works
her
mind
arose
to
the
adoration
of
the
deity
in
his
goodness
and
power
wherever
she
turned
her
view
whether
on
the
sleeping
earth
or
to
the
vast
regions
of
space
glowing
with
worlds
beyond
the
reach
of
human
thought
the
sublimity
of
god
and
the
majesty
of
his
presence
appeared
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
of
awful
love
and
admiration
and
she
felt
that
pure
devotion
superior
to
all
the
distinctions
of
human
system
which
lifts
the
soul
above
this
world
and
seems
to
expand
it
into
a
nobler
nature
such
devotion
as
can
perhaps
only
be
experienced
when
the
mind
rescued
for
a
moment
from
the
humbleness
of
earthly
considerations
aspires
to
contemplate
his
power
in
the
sublimity
of
his
works
and
his
goodness
in
the
infinity
of
his
blessings
is
it
not
now
the
hour
the
holy
hour
when
to
the
cloudless
height
of
yon
starred
concave
climbs
the
full-orbed
moon
and
to
this
nether
world
in
solemn
stillness
gives
sign
that
to
the
listâ€™ning
ear
of
heaven
religionâ€™s
voice
should
plead
the
very
babe
knows
this
and
chance
awakâ€™d
his
little
hands
lifts
to
the
gods
and
on
his
innocent
couch
calls
down
a
blessing
caractacus
the
midnight
chant
of
the
monks
soon
after
dropped
into
silence
but
emily
remained
at
the
casement
watching
the
setting
moon
and
the
valley
sinking
into
deep
shade
and
willing
to
prolong
her
present
state
of
mind
at
length
she
retired
to
her
mattress
and
sunk
into
tranquil
slumber
while
in
the
rosy
vale
love
breathâ€™d
his
infant
sighs
from
anguish
free
thomson
st
aubert
sufficiently
restored
by
a
nightâ€™s
repose
to
pursue
his
journey
set
out
in
the
morning
with
his
family
and
valancourt
for
rousillon
which
he
hoped
to
reach
before
night-fall
the
scenes
through
which
they
now
passed
were
as
wild
and
romantic
as
any
they
had
yet
observed
with
this
difference
that
beauty
every
now
and
then
softened
the
landscape
into
smiles
little
woody
recesses
appeared
among
the
mountains
covered
with
bright
verdure
and
flowers
or
a
pastoral
valley
opened
its
grassy
bosom
in
the
shade
of
the
cliffs
with
flocks
and
herds
loitering
along
the
banks
of
a
rivulet
that
refreshed
it
with
perpetual
green
st
aubert
could
not
repent
the
having
taken
this
fatiguing
road
though
he
was
this
day
also
frequently
obliged
to
alight
to
walk
along
the
rugged
precipice
and
to
climb
the
steep
and
flinty
mountain
the
wonderful
sublimity
and
variety
of
the
prospects
repaid
him
for
all
this
and
the
enthusiasm
with
which
they
were
viewed
by
his
young
companions
heightened
his
own
and
awakened
a
remembrance
of
all
the
delightful
emotions
of
his
early
days
when
the
sublime
charms
of
nature
were
first
unveiled
to
him
he
found
great
pleasure
in
conversing
with
valancourt
and
in
listening
to
his
ingenuous
remarks
the
fire
and
simplicity
of
his
manners
seemed
to
render
him
a
characteristic
figure
in
the
scenes
around
them
and
st
aubert
discovered
in
his
sentiments
the
justness
and
the
dignity
of
an
elevated
mind
unbiased
by
intercourse
with
the
world
he
perceived
that
his
opinions
were
formed
rather
than
imbibed
were
more
the
result
of
thought
than
of
learning
of
the
world
he
seemed
to
know
nothing
for
he
believed
well
of
all
mankind
and
this
opinion
gave
him
the
reflected
image
of
his
own
heart
st
aubert
as
he
sometimes
lingered
to
examine
the
wild
plants
in
his
path
often
looked
forward
with
pleasure
to
emily
and
valancourt
as
they
strolled
on
together
he
with
a
countenance
of
animated
delight
pointing
to
her
attention
some
grand
feature
of
the
scene
and
she
listening
and
observing
with
a
look
of
tender
seriousness
that
spoke
the
elevation
of
her
mind
they
appeared
like
two
lovers
who
had
never
strayed
beyond
these
their
native
mountains
whose
situation
had
secluded
them
from
the
frivolities
of
common
life
whose
ideas
were
simple
and
grand
like
the
landscapes
among
which
they
moved
and
who
knew
no
other
happiness
than
in
the
union
of
pure
and
affectionate
hearts
st
aubert
smiled
and
sighed
at
the
romantic
picture
of
felicity
his
fancy
drew
and
sighed
again
to
think
that
nature
and

were
so
little
known
to
the
world
as
that
their
pleasures
were

he
pursuing
this
train
of
thought
â€œridicules

its

for
virtue

little
more

cities
where
selfishness
dissipation
and
insincerity
supply
the
place
of
tenderness
simplicity
and
truthâ€
it
was
near
noon
when
the
travellers
having
arrived
at
a
piece
of
steep
and
dangerous
road
alighted
to
walk
the
road
wound
up
an
ascent
that
was
clothed
with
wood
and
instead
of
following
the
carriage
they
entered
the
refreshing
shade
a
dewy
coolness
was
diffused
upon
the
air
which
with
the
bright
verdure
of
turf
that
grew
under
the
trees
the
mingled
fragrance
of
flowers
and
of
balm
thyme
and
lavender
that
enriched
it
and
the
grandeur
of
the
pines
beech
and
chestnuts
that
overshadowed
them
rendered
this
a
most
delicious
retreat
sometimes
the
thick
foliage
excluded
all
view
of
the
country
at
others
it
admitted
some
partial
catches
of
the
distant
scenery
which
gave
hints
to
the
imagination
to
picture
landscapes
more
interesting
more
impressive
than
any
that
had
been
presented
to
the
eye
the
wanderers
often
lingered
to
indulge
in
these
reveries
of
fancy
the
pauses
of
silence
such
as
had
formerly
interrupted
the
conversations
of
valancourt
and
emily
were
more
frequent
today
than
ever
valancourt
often
dropped
suddenly
from
the
most
animating
vivacity
into
fits
of
deep
musing
and
there
was
sometimes
an
unaffected
melancholy
in
his
smile
which
emily
could
not
avoid
understanding
for
her
heart
was
interested
in
the
sentiment
it
spoke
st
aubert
was
refreshed
by
the
shades
and
they
continued
to
saunter
under
them
following
as
nearly
as
they
could
guess
the
direction
of
the
road
till
they
perceived
that
they
had
totally
lost
it
they
had
continued
near
the
brow
of
the
precipice
allured
by
the
scenery
it
exhibited
while
the
road
wound
far
away
over
the
cliff
above
valancourt
called
loudly
to
michael
but
heard
no
voice
except
his
own
echoing
among
the
rocks
and
his
various
efforts
to
regain
the
road
were
equally
unsuccessful
while
they
were
thus
circumstanced
they
perceived
a
shepherdâ€™s
cabin
between
the
boles
of
the
trees
at
some
distance
and
valancourt
bounded
on
first
to
ask
assistance
when
he
reached
it
he
saw
only
two
little
children
at
play
on
the
turf
before
the
door
he
looked
into
the
hut
but
no
person
was
there
and
the
eldest
of
the
boys
told
him
that
their
father
was
with
his
flocks
and
their
mother
was
gone
down
into
the
vale
but
would
be
back
presently
as
he
stood
considering
what
was
further
to
be
done
on
a
sudden
he
heard
michaelâ€™s
voice
roaring
forth
most
manfully
among
the
cliffs
above
till
he
made
their
echoes
ring
valancourt
immediately
answered
the
call
and
endeavoured
to
make
his
way
through
the
thicket
that
clothed
the
steeps
following
the
direction
of
the
sound
after
much
struggle
over
brambles
and
precipices
he
reached
michael
and
at
length
prevailed
with
him
to
be
silent
and
to
listen
to
him
the
road
was
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
spot
where
st
aubert
and
emily
were
the
carriage
could
not
easily
return
to
the
entrance
of
the
wood
and
since
it
would
be
very
fatiguing
for
st
aubert
to
climb
the
long
and
steep
road
to
the
place
where
it
now
stood
valancourt
was
anxious
to
find
a
more
easy
ascent
by
the
way
he
had
himself
passed
meanwhile
st
aubert
and
emily
approached
the
cottage
and
rested
themselves
on
a
rustic
bench
fastened
between
two
pines
which
overshadowed
it
till
valancourt
whose
steps
they
had
observed
should
return
the
eldest
of
the
children
desisted
from
his
play
and
stood
still
to
observe
the
strangers
while
the
younger
continued
his
little
gambols
and
teased
his
brother
to
join
in
them
st
aubert
looked
with
pleasure
upon
this
picture
of
infantine
simplicity
till
it
brought
to
his
remembrance
his
own
boys
whom
he
had
lost
about
the
age
of
these
and
their
lamented
mother
and
he
sunk
into
a
thoughtfulness
which
emily
observing
she
immediately
began
to
sing
one
of
those
simple
and
lively
airs
he
was
so
fond
of
and
which
she
knew
how
to
give
with
the
most
captivating
sweetness
st
aubert
smiled
on
her
through
his
tears
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
affectionately
and
then
tried
to
dissipate
the
melancholy
reflections
that
lingered
in
his
mind
while
she
sung
valancourt
approached
who
was
unwilling
to
interrupt
her
and
paused
at
a
little
distance
to
listen
when
she
had
concluded
he
joined
the
party
and
told
them
that
he
had
found
michael
as
well
as
a
way
by
which
he
thought
they
could
ascend
the
cliff
to
the
carriage
he
pointed
to
the
woody
steeps
above
which
st
aubert
surveyed
with
an
anxious
eye
he
was
already
wearied
by
his
walk
and
this
ascent
was
formidable
to
him
he
thought
however
it
would
be
less
toilsome
than
the
long
and
broken
road
and
he
determined
to
attempt
it
but
emily
ever
watchful
of
his
ease
proposing
that
he
should
rest
and
dine
before
they
proceeded
further
valancourt
went
to
the
carriage
for
the
refreshments
deposited
there
on
his
return
he
proposed
removing
a
little
higher
up
the
mountain
to
where
the
woods
opened
upon
a
grand
and
extensive
prospect
and
thither
they
were
preparing
to
go
when
they
saw
a
young
woman
join
the
children
and
caress
and
weep
over
them
the
travellers
interested
by
her
distress
stopped
to
observe
her
she
took
the
youngest
of
the
children
in
her
arms
and
perceiving
the
strangers
hastily
dried
her
tears
and
proceeded
to
the
cottage
st
aubert
on
enquiring
the
occasion
of
her
sorrow
learned
that
her
husband
who
was
a
shepherd
and
lived
here
in
the
summer
months
to
watch
over
the
flocks
he
led
to
feed
upon
these
mountains
had
lost
on
the
preceding
night
his
little
all
a
gang
of
gipsies
who
had
for
some
time
infested
the
neighbourhood
had
driven
away
several
of
his
masterâ€™s
sheep
â€œjacquesâ€
added
the
shepherdâ€™s
wife
â€œhad
saved
a
little
money
and
had
bought
a
few
sheep
with
it
and
now
they
must
go
to
his
master
for
those
that
are
stolen
and
what
is
worse
than
all
his
master
when
he
comes
to
know
how
it
is
will
trust
him
no
longer
with
the
care
of
his
flocks
for
he
is
a
hard
man
and
then
what
is
to
become
of
our
childrenâ€
the
innocent
countenance
of
the
woman
and
the
simplicity
of
her
manner
in
relating
her
grievance
inclined
st
aubert
to
believe
her
story
and
valancourt
convinced
that
it
was
true
asked
eagerly
what
was
the
value
of
the
stolen
sheep
on
hearing
which
he
turned
away
with
a
look
of
disappointment
st
aubert
put
some
money
into
her
hand
emily
too
gave
something
from
her
little
purse
and
they
walked
towards
the
cliff
but
valancourt
lingered
behind
and
spoke
to
the
shepherdâ€™s
wife
who
was
now
weeping
with
gratitude
and
surprise
he
enquired
how
much
money
was
yet
wanting
to
replace
the
stolen
sheep
and
found
that
it
was
a
sum
very
little
short
of
all
he
had
about
him
he
was
perplexed
and
distressed
â€œthis
sum
thenâ€
said
he
to
himself
â€œwould
make
this
poor
family
completely
happyâ€”it
is
in
my
power
to
give
itâ€”to
make
them
completely
happy
but
what
is
to
become
of
meâ€”how
shall
i
contrive
to
reach
home
with
the
little
money
that
will
remainâ€
for
a
moment
he
stood
unwilling
to
forego
the
luxury
of
raising
a
family
from
ruin
to
happiness
yet
considering
the
difficulties
of
pursuing
his
journey
with
so
small
a
sum
as
would
be
left
while
he
was
in
this
state
of
perplexity
the
shepherd
himself
appeared
his
children
ran
to
meet
him
he
took
one
of
them
in
his
arms
and
with
the
other
clinging
to
his
coat
came
forward
with
a
loitering
step
his
forlorn
and
melancholy
look
determined
valancourt
at
once
he
threw
down
all
the
money
he
had
except
a
very
few
louis
and
bounded
away
after
st
aubert
and
emily
who
were
proceeding
slowly
up
the
steep
valancourt
had
seldom
felt
his
heart
so
light
as
at
this
moment
his
gay
spirits
danced
with
pleasure
every
object
around
him
appeared
more
interesting
or
beautiful
than
before
st
aubert
observed
the
uncommon
vivacity
of
his
countenance
â€œwhat
has
pleased
you
so
muchâ€
said
he
â€œo
what
a
lovely
dayâ€
replied
valancourt
â€œhow
brightly
the
sun
shines
how
pure
is
this
air
what
enchanting
sceneryâ€
â€œit
is
indeed
enchantingâ€
said
st
aubert
whom
early
experience
had
taught
to
understand
the
nature
of
valancourtâ€™s
present
feelings
â€œwhat
pity
that
the
wealthy
who
can
command
such
sunshine
should
ever
pass
their
days
in
gloomâ€”in
the
cold
shade
of
selfishness
for
you
my
young
friend
may
the
sun
always
shine
as
brightly
as
at
this
moment
may
your
own
conduct
always
give
you
the
sunshine
of
benevolence
and
reason
unitedâ€
valancourt
highly
flattered
by
this
compliment
could
make
no
reply
but
by
a
smile
of
gratitude
they
continued
to
wind
under
the
woods
between
the
grassy
knolls
of
the
mountain
and
as
they
reached
the
shady
summit
which
he
had
pointed
out
the
whole
party
burst
into
an
exclamation
behind
the
spot
where
they
stood
the
rock
rose
perpendicularly
in
a
massy
wall
to
a
considerable
height
and
then
branched
out
into
overhanging
crags
their
grey
tints
were
well
contrasted
by
the
bright
hues
of
the
plants
and
wild
flowers
that
grew
in
their
fractured
sides
and
were
deepened
by
the
gloom
of
the
pines
and
cedars
that
waved
above
the
steeps
below
over
which
the
eye
passed
abruptly
to
the
valley
were
fringed
with
thickets
of
alpine
shrubs
and
lower
still
appeared
the
tufted
tops
of
the
chesnut
woods
that
clothed
their
base
among
which
peeped
forth
the
shepherdâ€™s
cottage
just
left
by
the
travellers
with
its
bluish
smoke
curling
high
in
the
air
on
every
side
appeared
the
majestic
summits
of
the
pyrenees
some
exhibiting
tremendous
crags
of
marble
whose
appearance
was
changing
every
instant
as
the
varying
lights
fell
upon
their
surface
others
still
higher
displaying
only
snowy
points
while
their
lower
steeps
were
covered
almost
invariably
with
forests
of
pine
larch
and
oak
that
stretched
down
to
the
vale
this
was
one
of
the
narrow
valleys
that
open
from
the
pyrenees
into
the
country
of
rousillon
and
whose
green
pastures
and
cultivated
beauty
form
a
decided
and
wonderful
contrast
to
the
romantic
grandeur
that
environs
it
through
a
vista
of
the
mountains
appeared
the
lowlands
of
rousillon
tinted
with
the
blue
haze
of
distance
as
they
united
with
the
waters
of
the
mediterranean
where
on
a
promontory
which
marked
the
boundary
of
the
shore
stood
a
lonely
beacon
over
which
were
seen
circling
flights
of
sea-fowl
beyond
appeared
now
and
then
a
stealing
sail
white
with
the
sunbeam
and
whose
progress
was
perceivable
by
its
approach
to
the
light-house
sometimes
too
was
seen
a
sail
so
distant
that
it
served
only
to
mark
the
line
of
separation
between
the
sky
and
the
waves
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
immediately
opposite
to
the
spot
where
the
travellers
rested
a
rocky
pass
opened
toward
gascony
here
no
sign
of
cultivation
appeared
the
rocks
of
granite
that
screened
the
glen
rose
abruptly
from
their
base
and
stretched
their
barren
points
to
the
clouds
unvaried
with
woods
and
uncheered
even
by
a
hunterâ€™s
cabin
sometimes
indeed
a
gigantic
larch
threw
its
long
shade
over
the
precipice
and
here
and
there
a
cliff
reared
on
its
brow
a
monumental
cross
to
tell
the
traveller
the
fate
of
him
who
had
ventured
thither
before
this
spot
seemed
the
very
haunt
of
banditti
and
emily
as
she
looked
down
upon
it
almost
expected
to
see
them
stealing
out
from
some
hollow
cave
to
look
for
their
prey
soon
after
an
object
not
less
terrific
struck
herâ€”a
gibbet
standing
on
a
point
of
rock
near
the
entrance
of
the
pass
and
immediately
over
one
of
the
crosses
she
had
before
observed
these
were
hieroglyphics
that
told
a
plain
and
dreadful
story
she
forbore
to
point
it
out
to
st
aubert
but
it
threw
a
gloom
over
her
spirits
and
made
her
anxious
to
hasten
forward
that
they
might
with
certainty
reach
rousillon
before
night-fall
it
was
necessary
however
that
st
aubert
should
take
some
refreshment
and
seating
themselves
on
the
short
dry
turf
they
opened
the
basket
of
provisions
while
by
breezy
murmurs
coolâ€™d
broad
oâ€™er
their
heads
the
verdant
cedars
wave
and
high
palmetos
lift
their
graceful
shade
â€”â€”â€”they
draw
ethereal
soul
there
drink
reviving
gales
profusely
breathing
from
the
piney
groves
and
vales
of
fragrance
there
at
a
distance
hear
the
roaring
floods
and
cataracts
thomson
st
aubert
was
revived
by
rest
and
by
the
serene
air
of
this
summit
and
valancourt
was
so
charmed
with
all
around
and
with
the
conversation
of
his
companions
that
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
he
had
any
further
to
go
having
concluded
their
simple
repast
they
gave
a
long
farewell
look
to
the
scene
and
again
began
to
ascend
st
aubert
rejoiced
when
he
reached
the
carriage
which
emily
entered
with
him
but
valancourt
willing
to
take
a
more
extensive
view
of
the
enchanting
country
into
which
they
were
about
to
descend

he
could
do
from
a
carriage

his
dogs
and
once
more
bounded
with
them
along
the
banks
of
the
road
he
often
quitted
it
for
points
that
promised
a
wider
prospect
and
the
slow
pace
at
which
the
mules
travelled
allowed
him
to
overtake
them
with
ease
whenever
a
scene
of
uncommon
magnificence
appeared
he
hastened
to
inform
st
aubert
who
though
he
was
too
much
tired
to
walk
himself
sometimes
made
the
chaise
wait
while
emily
went
to
the
neighbouring
cliff
it
was
evening
when
they
descended

bind

form
a
majestic
barrier

gleamed

a

was
diffused

proposed
to

have
passed

not
the
approaching

thrown

to
go
further
but
did
not
repeat
the
invitation
and
valancourt
had
resolution
enough
to
forego
the
temptation
of
accepting
it
that
he
might
prove
himself
not
unworthy
of
the
favour
on
the
following
morning
therefore
they
were
to
part
st
aubert
to
pursue
his
way
to
languedoc
and
valancourt
to
explore
new
scenes
among
the
mountains
on
his
return
home
during
this
evening
he
was
often
silent
and
thoughtful
st
aubertâ€™s
manner
towards
him
was
affectionate
though
grave
and
emily
was
serious
though
she
made
frequent
efforts
to
appear
cheerful
after
one
of
the
most
melancholy
evenings
they
had
yet
passed
together
they
separated
for
the
night
i
care
not
fortune
what
you
me
deny
you
cannot
rob
me
of
free
natureâ€™s
grace
you
cannot
shut
the
windows
of
the
sky
through
which
aurora
shows
her
brightening
face
you
cannot
bar
my
constant
feet
to
trace
the
woods
and
lawns
by
living
stream
at
eve
let
health
my
nerves
and
finer
fibres
brace
and
i
their
toys
to
the
great
children
leave
of
fancy
reason
virtue
nought
can
me
bereave
thomson
in
the
morning
valancourt
breakfasted
with
st
aubert
and
emily
neither
of
whom
seemed
much
refreshed
by
sleep
the
languor
of
illness
still
hung
over
st
aubert
and
to
emilyâ€™s
fears
his
disorder
appeared
to
be
increasing
fast
upon
him
she
watched
his
looks
with
anxious
affection
and
their
expression
was
always
faithfully
reflected
in
her
own
at
the
commencement
of
their
acquaintance
valancourt
had
made
known
his
name
and
family
st
aubert
was
not
a
stranger
to
either
for
the
family
estates
which
were
now
in
the
possession
of
an
elder
brother
of
valancourt
were
little
more
than
twenty
miles
distant
from
la
vallã©e
and
he
had
sometimes
met
the
elder
valancourt
on
visits
in
the
neighbourhood
this
knowledge
had
made
him
more
willingly
receive
his
present
companion
for
though
his
countenance
and
manners
would
have
won
him
the
acquaintance
of
st
aubert
who
was
very
apt
to
trust
to
the
intelligence
of
his
own
eyes
with
respect
to
countenances
he
would
not
have
accepted
these
as
sufficient
introductions
to
that
of
his
daughter
the
breakfast
was
almost
as
silent
as
the
supper
of
the
preceding
night
but
their
musing
was
at
length
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
the
carriage
wheels
which
were
to
bear
away
st
aubert
and
emily
valancourt
started
from
his
chair
and
went
to
the
window
it
was
indeed
the
carriage
and
he
returned
to
his
seat
without
speaking
the
moment
was
now
come
when
they
must
part
st
aubert
told
valancourt
that
he
hoped
he
would
never
pass
la
vallã©e
without
favouring
him
with
a
visit
and
valancourt
eagerly
thanking
him
assured
him
that
he
never
would
as
he
said
which
he
looked
timidly
at
emily
who
tried
to
smile
away
the
seriousness
of
her
spirits
they
passed
a
few
minutes
in
interesting
conversation
and
st
aubert
then
led
the
way
to
the
carriage
emily
and
valancourt
following
in
silence
the
latter
lingered
at
the
door
several
minutes
after
they
were
seated
and
none
of
the
party
seemed
to
have
courage
enough
to
sayâ€”farewell
at
length
st
aubert
pronounced
the
melancholy
word
which
emily
passed
to
valancourt
who
returned
it
with
a
dejected
smile
and
the
carriage
drove
on
the
travellers
remained
for
some
time
in
a
state
of
tranquil
pensiveness
which
is
not
unpleasing
st
aubert
interrupted
it
by
observing
â€œthis
is
a
very
promising
young
man
it
is
many
years
since
i
have
been
so
much
pleased
with
any
person
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
he
brings
back
to
my
memory
the
days
of
my
youth
when
every
scene
was
new
and
delightfulâ€
st
aubert
sighed
and
sunk
again
into
a
reverie
and
as
emily
looked
back
upon
the
road
they
had
passed
valancourt
was
seen
at
the
door
of
the
little
inn
following
them
with
his
eyes
her
perceived
her
and
waved
his
hand
and
she
returned
the
adieu
till
the
winding
road
shut
her
from
his
sight
â€œi
remember
when
i
was
about
his
ageâ€
resumed
st
aubert
â€œand
i
thought
and
felt
exactly
as
he
does
the
world
was
opening
upon
me
then
nowâ€”it
is
closingâ€
â€œmy
dear
sir
do
not
think
so
gloomilyâ€
said
emily
in
a
trembling
voice
â€œi
hope
you
have
many
many
years
to
liveâ€”for
your
own
sakeâ€”for
my
sakeâ€
â€œah
my
emilyâ€
replied
st
aubert
â€œfor
thy
sake
wellâ€”i
hope
it
is
soâ€
he
wiped
away
a
tear
that
was
stealing
down
his
cheek
threw
a
smile
upon
his
countenance
and
said
in
a
cheering
voice
â€œthere
is
something
in
the
ardour
and
ingenuousness
of
youth
which
is
particularly
pleasing
to
the
contemplation
of
an
old
man
if
his
feelings
have
not
been
entirely
corroded
by
the
world
it
is
cheering
and
reviving
like
the
view
of
spring
to
a
sick
person
his
mind
catches
somewhat
of
the
spirit
of
the
season
and
his
eyes
are
lighted
up
with
a
transient
sunshine
valancourt
is
this
spring
to
meâ€
emily
who
pressed
her
fatherâ€™s
hand
affectionately
had
never
before
listened
with
so
much
pleasure
to
the
praises
he
bestowed
no
not
even
when
he
had
bestowed
them
on
herself
they
travelled
on
among
vineyards
woods
and
pastures
delighted
with
the
romantic
beauty
of
the
landscape
which
was
bounded
on
one
side
by
the
grandeur
of
the
pyrenees
and
on
the
other
by
the
ocean
and
soon
after
noon
they
reached
the
town
of
colioure
situated
on
the
mediterranean
here
they
dined
and
rested
till
towards
the
cool
of
day
when
they
pursued
their
way
along
the
shoresâ€”those
enchanting
shoresâ€”which
extend
to
languedoc
emily
gazed
with
enthusiasm
on
the
vastness
of
the
sea
its
surface
varying
as
the
lights
and
shadows
fell
and
on
its
woody
banks
mellowed
with
autumnal
tints
st
aubert
was
impatient
to
reach
perpignan
where
he
expected
letters
from
m
quesnel
and
it
was
the
expectation
of
these
letters
that
had
induced
him
to
leave
colioure
for
his
feeble
frame
had
required
immediate
rest
after
travelling
a
few
miles
he
fell
asleep
and
emily
who
had
put
two
or
three
books
into
the
carriage
on
leaving
la
vallã©e
had
now
the
leisure
for
looking
into
them
she
sought
for
one
in
which
valancourt
had
been
reading
the
day
before
and
hoped
for
the
pleasure
of
retracing
a
page
over
which
the
eyes
of
a
beloved
friend
had
lately
passed
of
dwelling
on
the
passages
which
he
had
admired
and
of
permitting
them
to
speak
to
her
in
the
language
of
his
own
mind
and
to
bring
himself
to
her
presence
on
searching
for
the
book
she
could
find
it
nowhere
but
in
its
stead
perceived
a
volume
of
petrarchâ€™s
poems
that
had
belonged
to
valancourt
whose
name
was
written
in
it
and
from
which
he
had
frequently
read
passages
to
her
with
all
the
pathetic
expression
that
characterised
the
feelings
of
the
author
she
hesitated
in
believing
what
would
have
been
sufficiently
apparent
to
almost
any
other
person
that
he
had
purposely
left
this
book
instead
of
the
one
she
had
lost
and
that
love
had
prompted
the
exchange
but
having
opened
it
with
impatient
pleasure
and
observed
the
lines
of
his
pencil
drawn
along
the
various
passages
he
had
read
aloud
and
under
others
more
descriptive
of
delicate
tenderness
than
he
had
dared
to
trust
his
voice
with
the
conviction
came
at
length
to
her
mind
for
some
moments
she
was
conscious
only
of
being
beloved
then
a
recollection
of
all
the
variations
of
tone
and
countenance
with
which
he
had
recited
these
sonnets
and
of
the
soul
which
spoke
in
their
expression
pressed
to
her
memory
and
she
wept
over
the
memorial
of
his
affection
they
arrived
at
perpignan
soon
after
sunset
where
st
aubert
found
as
he
had
expected
letters
from
m
quesnel
the
contents
of
which
so
evidently
and
grievously
affected
him
that
emily
was
alarmed
and
pressed
him
as
far
as
her
delicacy
would
permit
to
disclose
the
occasion
of
his
concern
but
he
answered
her
only
by
tears
and
immediately
began
to
talk
on
other
topics
emily
though
she
forbore
to
press
the
one
most
interesting
to
her
was
greatly
affected
by
her
fatherâ€™s
manner
and
passed
a
night
of
sleepless
solicitude
in
the
morning
they
pursued
their
journey
along
the
coast
towards
leucate
another
town
on
the
mediterranean
situated
on
the
borders
of
languedoc
and
rousillon
on
the
way
emily
renewed
the
subject
of
the
preceding
night
and
appeared
so
deeply
affected
by
st
aubertâ€™s
silence
and
dejection
that
he
relaxed
from
his
reserve
â€œi
was
unwilling
my
dear
emilyâ€
said
he
â€œto
throw
a
cloud
over
the
pleasure
you
receive
from
these
scenes
and
meant
therefore
to
conceal
for
the
present
some
circumstances
with
which
however
you
must
at
length
have
been
made
acquainted
but
your
anxiety
has
defeated
my
purpose
you
suffer
as
much
from
this
perhaps
as
you
will
do
from
a
knowledge
of
the
facts
i
have
to
relate
m
quesnelâ€™s
visit
proved
an
unhappy
one
to
me
he
came
to
tell
me
part
of
the
news
he
has
now
confirmed
you
may
have
heard
me
mention
a
m
motteville
of
paris
but
you
did
not
know
that
the
chief
of
my
personal
property
was
invested
in
his
hands
i
had
great
confidence
in
him
and
i
am
yet
willing
to
believe
that
he
is
not
wholly
unworthy
of
my
esteem
a
variety
of
circumstances
have
concurred
to
ruin
him
andâ€”i
am
ruined
with
himâ€
st
aubert
paused
to
conceal
his
emotion
â€œthe
letters
i
have
just
received
from
m
quesnelâ€
resumed
he
struggling
to
speak
with
firmness
â€œenclosed
others
from
motteville
which
confirmed
all
i
dreadedâ€
â€œmust
we
then
quit
la
vallã©eâ€
said
emily
after
a
long
pause
of
silence
â€œthat
is
yet
uncertainâ€
replied
st
aubert
â€œit
will
depend
upon
the
compromise
motteville
is
able
to
make
with
his
creditors
my
income
you
know
was
never
large
and
now
it
will
be
reduced
to
little
indeed
it
is
for
you
emily
for
you
my
child
that
i
am
most
afflictedâ€
his
last
words
faltered
emily
smiled
tenderly
upon
him
through
her
tears
and
then
endeavouring
to
overcome
her
emotion
â€œmy
dear
fatherâ€
said
she
â€œdo
not
grieve
for
me
or
for
yourself
we
may
yet
be
happyâ€”if
la
vallã©e
remains
for
us
we
must
be
happy
we
will
retain
only
one
servant
and
you
shall
scarcely
perceive
the
change
in
your
income
be
comforted
my
dear
sir
we
shall
not
feel
the
want
of
those
luxuries
which
others
value
so
highly
since
we
never
had
a
taste
for
them
and
poverty
cannot
deprive
us
of
many
consolations
it
cannot
rob
us
of
the
affection
we
have
for
each
other
or
degrade
us
in
our
own
opinion
or
in
that
of
any
person
whose
opinion
we
ought
to
valueâ€
st
aubert
concealed
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
and
was
unable
to
speak
but
emily
continued
to
urge
to
her
father
the
truths
which
himself
had
impressed
upon
her
mind
â€œbesides
my
dear
sir
poverty
cannot
deprive
us
of
intellectual
delights
it
cannot
deprive
you
of
the
comfort
of
affording
me
examples
of
fortitude
and
benevolence
nor
me
of
the
delight
of
consoling
a
beloved
parent
it
cannot
deaden
our
taste
for
the
grand
and
the
beautiful
or
deny
us
the
means
of
indulging
it
for
the
scenes
of
natureâ€”those
sublime
spectacles
so
infinitely
superior
to
all
artificial
luxuries
are
open
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
poor
as
well
as
of
the
rich
of
what
then
have
we
to
complain
so
long
as
we
are
not
in
want
of
necessaries
pleasures
such
as
wealth
cannot
buy
will
still
be
ours
we
retain
then
the
sublime
luxuries
of
nature
and
lose
only
the
frivolous
ones
of
artâ€
st
aubert
could
not
reply
he
caught
emily
to
his
bosom
their
tears
flowed
together
butâ€”they
were
not
tears
of
sorrow
after
this
language
of
the
heart
all
other
would
have
been
feeble
and
they
remained
silent
for
some
time
then
st
aubert
conversed
as
before
for
if
his
mind
had
not
recovered
its
natural
tranquillity
it
at
least
assumed
the
appearance
of
it
they
reached
the
romantic
town
of
leucate
early
in
the
day
but
st
aubert
was
weary
and
they
determined
to
pass
the
night
there
in
the
evening
he
exerted
himself
so
far
as
to
walk
with
his
daughter
to
view
the
environs
that
overlook
the
lake
of
leucate
the
mediterranean
part
of
rousillon
with
the
pyrenees
and
a
wide
extent
of
the
luxuriant
province
of
languedoc
now
blushing
with
the
ripened
vintage
which
the
peasants
were
beginning
to
gather
st
aubert
and
emily
saw
the
busy
groups
caught
the
joyous
song
that
was
wafted
on
the
breeze
and
anticipated
with
apparent
pleasure
their
next
dayâ€™s
journey
over
this
gay
region
he
designed
however
still
to
wind
along
the
sea-shore
to
return
home
immediately
was
partly
his
wish
but
from
this
he
was
withheld
by
a
desire
to
lengthen
the
pleasure
which
the
journey
gave
his
daughter
and
to
try
the
effect
of
the
sea
air
on
his
own
disorder
on
the
following
day
therefore
they
recommenced
their
journey
through
languedoc
winding
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
the
pyrenees
still
forming
the
magnificent
back-ground
of
their
prospects
while
on
their
right
was
the
ocean
and
on
their
left
wide
extended
plains
melting
into
the
blue
horizon
st
aubert
was
pleased
and
conversed
much
with
emily
yet
his
cheerfulness
was
sometimes
artificial
and
sometimes
a
shade
of
melancholy
would
steal
upon
his
countenance
and
betray
him
this
was
soon
chased
away
by
emilyâ€™s
smile
who
smiled
however
with
an
aching
heart
for
she
saw
that
his
misfortunes
preyed
upon
his
mind
and
upon
his
enfeebled
frame
it
was
evening
when
they
reached
a
small
village
of
upper
languedoc
where
they
meant
to
pass
the
night
but
the
place
could
not
afford
them
beds
for
here
too
it
was
the
time
of
the
vintage
and
they
were
obliged
to
proceed
to
the
next
post
the
languor
of
illness
and
of
fatigue
which
returned
upon
st
aubert
required
immediate
repose
and
the
evening
was
now
far
advanced
but
from
necessity
there
was
no
appeal
and
he
ordered
michael
to
proceed
the
rich
plains
of
languedoc
which
exhibited
all
the
glories
of
the
vintage
with
the
gaieties
of
a
french
festival
no
longer
awakened
st
aubert
to
pleasure
whose
condition
formed
a
mournful
contrast
to
the
hilarity
and
youthful
beauty
which
surrounded
him
as
his
languid
eyes
moved
over
the
scene
he
considered
that
they
would
soon
perhaps
be
closed
for
ever
on
this
world
â€œthose
distant
and
sublime
mountainsâ€
said
he
secretly
as
he
gazed
on
a
chain
of
the
pyrenees
that
stretched
towards
the
west
â€œthese
luxuriant
plains
this
blue
vault
the
cheerful
light
of
day
will
be
shut
from
my
eyes
the
song
of
the
peasant
the
cheering
voice
of
manâ€”will
no
longer
sound
for
meâ€
the
intelligent
eyes
of
emily
seemed
to
read
what
passed
in
the
mind
of
her
father
and
she
fixed
them
on
his
face
with
an
expression
of
such
tender
pity
as
recalled
his
thoughts
from
every
desultory
object
of
regret
and
he
remembered
only
that
he
must
leave
his
daughter
without
protection
this
reflection
changed
regret
to
agony
he
sighed
deeply
and
remained
silent
while
she
seemed
to
understand
that
sigh
for
she
pressed
his
hand
affectionately
and
then
turned
to
the
window
to
conceal
her
tears
the
sun
now
threw
a
last
yellow
gleam
on
the
waves
of
the
mediterranean
and
the
gloom
of
twilight
spread
fast
over
the
scene
till
only
a
melancholy
ray
appeared
on
the
western
horizon
marking
the
point
where
the
sun
had
set
amid
the
vapours
of
an
autumnal
evening
a
cool
breeze
now
came
from
the
shore
and
emily
let
down
the
glass
but
the
air
which
was
refreshing
to
health
was
as
chilling
to
sickness
and
st
aubert
desired
that
the
window
might
be
drawn
up
increasing
illness
made
him
now
more
anxious
than
ever
to
finish
the
dayâ€™s
journey
and
he
stopped
the
muleteer
to
enquire
how
far
they
had
yet
to
go
to
the
next
post
he
replied
â€œnine
milesâ€
â€œi
feel
i
am
unable
to
proceed
much
furtherâ€
said
st
aubert
â€œenquire
as
you
go
if
there
is
any
house
on
the
road
that
would
accommodate
us
for
the
nightâ€
he
sunk
back
in
the
carriage
and
michael
cracking
his
whip
in
the
air
set
off
and
continued
on
the
full
gallop
till
st
aubert
almost
fainting
called
to
him
to
stop
emily
looked
anxiously
from
the
window
and
saw
a
peasant
walking
at
some
little
distance
on
the
road
for
whom
they
waited
till
he
came
up
when
he
was
asked
if
there
was
any
house
in
the
neighbourhood
that
accommodated
travellers
he
replied
that
he
knew
of
none
â€œthere
is
a
chã¢teau
indeed
among
those
woods
on
the
rightâ€
added
he
â€œbut
i
believe
it
receives
nobody
and
i
cannot
show
you
the
way
for
i
am
almost
a
stranger
hereâ€
st
aubert
was
going
to
ask
him
some
further
question
concerning
the
chã¢teau
but
the
man
abruptly
passed
on
after
some
consideration
he
ordered
michael
to
proceed
slowly
to
the
woods
every
moment
now
deepened
the
twilight
and
increased
the
difficulty
of
finding
the
road
another
peasant
soon
after
passed
â€œwhich
is
the
way
to
the
chã¢teau
in
the
woodsâ€
cried
michael
â€œthe
chã¢teau
in
the
woodsâ€
exclaimed
the
peasantâ€”â€œdo
you
mean
that
with
the
turret
yonderâ€
â€œi
donâ€™t
know
as
for
the
turret
as
you
call
itâ€
said
michael
â€œi
mean
that
white
piece
of
a
building
that
we
see
at
a
distance
there
among
the
treesâ€
â€œyes
that
is
the
turret
why
who
are
you
that
you
are
going
thitherâ€
said
the
man
with
surprise
st
aubert
on
hearing
this
odd
question
and
observing
the
peculiar
tone
in
which
it
was
delivered
looked
out
from
the
carriage
â€œwe
are
travellersâ€
said
he
â€œwho
are
in
search
of
a
house
of
accommodation
for
the
night
is
there
any
hereaboutâ€
â€œnone
monsieur
unless
you
have
a
mind
to
try
your
luck
yonderâ€
replied
the
peasant
pointing
to
the
woods
â€œbut
i
would
not
advise
you
to
go
thereâ€
â€œto
whom
does
the
chã¢teau
belongâ€
â€œi
scarcely
know
myself
monsieurâ€
â€œit
is
uninhabited
thenâ€â€”â€œno
not
uninhabited
the
steward
and
housekeeper
are
there
i
believeâ€
on
hearing
this
st
aubert
determined
to
proceed
to
the
chã¢teau
and
risk
the
refusal
of
being
accommodated
for
the
night
he
therefore
desired
the
countryman
would
show
michael
the
way
and
bade
him
expect
reward
for
his
trouble
the
man
was
for
a
moment
silent
and
then
said
that
he
was
going
on
other
business
but
that
the
road
could
not
be
missed
if
they
went
up
an
avenue
to
the
right
to
which
he
pointed
st
aubert
was
going
to
speak
but
the
peasant
wished
him
good
night
and
walked
on
the
carriage
now
moved
towards
the
avenue
which
was
guarded
by
a
gate
and
michael
having
dismounted
to
open
it
they
entered
between
rows
of
ancient
oak
and
chesnut
whose
intermingled
branches
formed
a
lofty
arch
above
there
was
something
so
gloomy
and
desolate
in
the
appearance
of
this
avenue
and
its
lonely
silence
that
emily
almost
shuddered
as
she
passed
along
and
recollecting
the
manner
in
which
the
peasant
had
mentioned
the
chã¢teau
she
gave
a
mysterious
meaning
to
his
words
such
as
she
had
not
suspected
when
he
uttered
them
these
apprehensions
however
she
tried
to
check
considering
that
they
were
probably
the
effect
of
a
melancholy
imagination
which
her
fatherâ€™s
situation
and
a
consideration
of
her
own
circumstances
had
made
sensible
to
every
impression
they
passed
slowly
on
for
they
were
now
almost
in
darkness
which
together
with
the
unevenness
of
the
ground
and
the
frequent
roots
of
old
trees
that
shot
up
above
the
soil
made
it
necessary
to
proceed
with
caution
on
a
sudden
michael
stopped
the
carriage
and
as
st
aubert
looked
from
the
window
to
enquire
the
cause
he
perceived
a
figure
at
some
distance
moving
up
the
avenue
the
dusk
would
not
permit
him
to
distinguish
what
it
was
but
he
bade
michael
go
on
â€œthis
seems
a
wild
placeâ€
said
michael
â€œthere
is
no
house
hereabout
donâ€™t
your
honour
think
we
had
better
turn
backâ€
â€œgo
a
little
farther
and
if
we
see
no
house
then
we
will
return
to
the
roadâ€
replied
st
aubert
michael
proceeded
with
reluctance
and
the
extreme
slowness
of
his
pace
made
st
aubert
look
again
from
the
window
to
hasten
him
when
again
he
saw
the
same
figure
he
was
somewhat
startled
probably
the
gloominess
of
the
spot
made
him
more
liable
to
alarm
than
usual
however
this
might
be
he
now
stopped
michael
and
bade
him
call
to
the
person
in
the
avenue
â€œplease
your
honour
he
may
be
a
robberâ€
said
michael
â€œit
does
not
please
meâ€
replied
st
aubert
who
could
not
forbear
smiling
at
the
simplicity
of
his
phrase
â€œand
we
will
therefore
return
to
the
road
for
i
see
no
probability
of
meeting
here
with
what
we
seekâ€
michael
turned
about
immediately
and
was
retracing
his
way
with
alacrity
when
a
voice
was
heard
from
among
the
trees
on
the
left
it
was
not
the
voice
of
command
or
distress
but
a
deep
hollow
tone
which
seemed
to
be
scarcely
human
the
man
whipped
his
mules
till
they
went
as
fast
as
possible
regardless
of
the
darkness
the
broken
ground
and
the
necks
of
the
whole
party
nor
once
stopped
till
he
reached
the
gate
which
opened
from
the
avenue
into
the
high-road
where
he
went
into
a
more
moderate
pace
â€œi
am
very
illâ€
said
st
aubert
taking
his
daughterâ€™s
hand
â€œyou
are
worse
then
sirâ€
said
emily
extremely
alarmed
by
his
manner
â€œyou
are
worse
and
here
is
no
assistance
good
god
what
is
to
be
doneâ€
he
leaned
his
head
on
her
shoulder
while
she
endeavoured
to
support
him
with
her
arm
and
michael
was
again
ordered
to
stop
when
the
rattling
of
the
wheels
had
ceased
music
was
heard
on
their
air
it
was
to
emily
the
voice
of
hope
â€œoh
we
are
near
some
human
habitationâ€
said
she
â€œhelp
may
soon
be
hadâ€
she
listened
anxiously
the
sounds
were
distant
and
seemed
to
come
from
a
remote
part
of
the
woods
that
bordered
the
road
and
as
she
looked
towards
the
spot
whence
they
issued
she
perceived
in
the
faint
moonlight
something
like
a
chã¢teau
it
was
difficult
however
to
reach
this
st
aubert
was
now
too
ill
to
bear
the
motion
of
the
carriage
michael
could
not
quit
his
mules
and
emily
who
still
supported
her
father
feared
to
leave
him
and
also
feared
to
venture
alone
to
such
a
distance
she
knew
not
whither
or
to
whom
something
however
it
was
necessary
to
determine
upon
immediately
st
aubert
therefore
told
michael
to
proceed
slowly
but
they
had
not
gone
far
when
he
fainted
and
the
carriage
was
again
stopped
he
lay
quite
senselessâ€”â€œmy
dear
dear
fatherâ€
cried
emily
in
great
agony
who
began
to
fear
that
he
was
dying
â€œspeak
if
it
is
only
one
word
to
let
me
hear
the
sound
of
your
voiceâ€
but
no
voice
spoke
in
reply
in
the
agony
of
terror
she
bade
michael
bring
water
from
the
rivulet
that
flowed
along
the
road
and
having
received
some
in
the
manâ€™s
hat
with
trembling
hands
she
sprinkled
it
over
her
fatherâ€™s
face
which
as
the
moonâ€™s
rays
now
fell
upon
it
seemed
to
bear
the
impression
of
death
every
emotion
of
selfish
fear
now
gave
way
to
a
stronger
influence
and
committing
st
aubert
to
the
care
of
michael
who
refused
to
go
far
from
his
mules
she
stepped
from
the
carriage
in
search
of
the
chã¢teau
she
had
seen
at
a
distance
it
was
a
still
moonlight
night
and
the
music
which
yet
sounded
on
the
air
directed
her
steps
from
the
high
road
up
a
shadowy
lane
that
led
to
the
woods
her
mind
was
for
some
time
so
entirely
occupied
by
anxiety
and
terror
for
her
father
that
she
felt
none
for
herself
till
the
deepening
gloom
of
the
overhanging
foliage
which
now
wholly
excluded
the
moonlight
and
the
wildness
of
the
place
recalled
her
to
a
sense
of
her
adventurous
situation
the
music
had
ceased
and
she
had
no
guide
but
chance
for
a
moment
she
paused
in
terrified
perplexity
till
a
sense
of
her
fatherâ€™s
condition
again
overcoming
every
consideration
for
herself
she
proceeded
the
lane
terminated
in
the
woods
but
she
looked
round
in
vain
for
a
house
or
a
human
being
and
as
vainly
listened
for
a
sound
to
guide
her
she
hurried
on
however
not
knowing
whither
avoiding
the
recesses
of
the
woods
and
endeavouring
to
keep
along
their
margin
till
a
rude
kind
of
avenue
which
opened
upon
a
moonlight
spot
arrested
her
attention
the
wildness
of
this
avenue
brought
to
her
recollection
the
one
leading
to
the
turreted
chã¢teau
and
she
was
inclined
to
believe
that
this
was
a
part
of
the
same
domain
and
probably
led
to
the
same
point
while
she
hesitated
whether
to
follow
it
or
not
a
sound
of
many
voices
in
loud
merriment
burst
upon
her
ear
it
seemed
not
the
laugh
of
cheerfulness
but
of
riot
and
she
stood
appalled
while
she
paused
she
heard
a
distant
voice
calling
from
the
way
she
had
come
and
not
doubting
but
it
was
that
of
michael
her
first
impulse
was
to
hasten
back
but
a
second
thought
changed
her
purpose
she
believed
that
nothing
less
than
the
last
extremity
could
have
prevailed
with
michael
to
quit
his
mules
and
fearing
that
her
father
was
now
dying
she
rushed
forward
with
a
feeble
hope
of
obtaining
assistance
from
the
people
in
the
woods
her
heart
beat
with
fearful
expectation
as
she
drew
near
the
spot
whence
the
voices
issued
and
she
often
startled
when
her
steps
disturbed
the
fallen
leaves
the
sounds
led
her
towards
the
moonlight
glade
she
had
before
noticed
at
a
little
distance
from
which
she
stopped
and
saw
between
the
boles
of
the
trees
a
small
circular
level
of
green
turf
surrounded
by
the
woods
on
which
appeared
a
group
of
figures
on
drawing
nearer
she
distinguished
these
by
their
dress
to
be
peasants
and
perceived
several
cottages
scattered
round
the
edge
of
the
woods
which
waved
loftily
over
this
spot
while
she
gazed
and
endeavoured
to
overcome
the
apprehensions
that
withheld
her
steps
several
peasant
girls
came
out
of
a
cottage
music
instantly
struck
up
and
the
dance
began
it
was
the
joyous
music
of
the
vintageâ€”the
same
she
had
before
heard
upon
the
air
her
heart
occupied
with
terror
for
her
father
could
not
feel
the
contrast
which
this
gay
scene
offered
to
her
own
distress
she
stepped
hastily
forward
towards
a
group
of
elder
peasants
who
were
seated
at
the
door
of
a
cottage
and
having
explained
her
situation
entreated
their
assistance
several
of
them
rose
with
alacrity
and
offering
any
service
in
their
power
followed
emily
who
seemed
to
move
on
the
wind
as
fast
as
they
could
towards
the
road
when
she
reached
the
carriage
she
found
st
aubert
restored
to
animation
on
the
recovery
of
his
senses
having
heard
from
michael
whither
his
daughter
was
gone
anxiety
for
her
overcame
every
regard
for
himself
and
he
had
sent
him
in
search
of
her
he
was
however
still
languid
and
perceiving
himself
unable
to
travel
much
farther
he
renewed
his
enquiries
for
an
inn
and
concerning
the
chã¢teau
in
the
woods
â€œthe
chã¢teau
cannot
accommodate
you
sirâ€
said
a
venerable
peasant
who
had
followed
emily
from
the
woods
â€œit
is
scarcely
inhabited
but
if
you
will
do
me
the
honour
to
visit
my
cottage
you
shall
be
welcome
to
the
best
bed
it
affordsâ€
st
aubert
was
himself
a
frenchman
he
therefore
was
not
surprised
at
french
courtesy
but
ill
as
he
was
he
felt
the
value
of
the
offer
enhanced
by
the
manner
which
accompanied
it
he
had
too
much
delicacy
to
apologise
or
to
appear
to
hesitate
about
availing
himself
of
the
peasantâ€™s
hospitality
but
immediately
accepted
it
with
the
same
frankness
with
which
it
was
offered
the
carriage
again
moved
slowly
on
michael
following
the
peasants
up
the
lane
which
emily
had
just
quitted
till
they
came
to
the
moonlight
glade
st
aubertâ€™s
spirits
were
so
far
restored
by
the
courtesy
of
his
host
and
the
near
prospect
of
repose
that
he
looked
with
a
sweet
complacency
upon
the
moonlight
scene
surrounded
by
the
shadowy
woods
through
which
here
and
there
an
opening
admitted
the
streaming
splendour
discovering
a
cottage
or
a
sparkling
rivulet
he
listened
with
no
painful
emotion
to
the
merry
notes
of
the
guitar
and
tamborine
and
though
tears
came
to
his
eyes
when
he
saw
the
debonnaire
dance
of
the
peasants
they
were
not
merely
tears
of
mournful
regret
with
emily
it
was
otherwise
immediate
terror
for
her
father
had
now
subsided
into
a
gentle
melancholy
which
every
note
of
joy
by
awakening
comparison
served
to
heighten
the
dance
ceased
on
the
approach
of
the
carriage
which
was
a
phenomenon
in
these
sequestered
woods
and
the
peasantry
flocked
round
it
with
eager
curiosity
on
learning
that
it
brought
a
sick
stranger
several
girls
ran
across
the
turf
and
returned
with
wine
and
baskets
of
grapes
which
they
presented
to
the
travellers
each
with
kind
contention
pressing
for
a
preference
at
length
the
carriage
stopped
at
a
neat
cottage
and
his
venerable
conductor
having
assisted
st
aubert
to
alight
led
him
and
emily
to
a
small
inner
room
illuminated
only
by
moonbeams
which
the
open
casement
admitted
st
aubert
rejoicing
in
rest
seated
himself
in
an
arm-chair
and
his
senses
were
refreshed
by
the
cool
and
balmy
air
that
lightly
waved
the
embowering
honeysuckles
and
wafted
their
sweet
breath
into
the
apartment
his
host
who
was
called
la
voisin
quitted
the
room
but
soon
returned
with
fruits
cream
and
all
the
pastoral
luxury
his
cottage
afforded
having
set
down
which
with
a
smile
of
unfeigned
welcome
he
retired
behind
the
chair
of
his
guest
st
aubert
insisted
on
his
taking
a
seat
at
the
table
and
when
the
fruit
had
allayed
the
fever
of
his
palate
and
he
found
himself
somewhat
revived
he
began
to
converse
with
his
host
who
communicated
several
particulars
concerning
himself
and
his
family
which
were
interesting
because
they
were
spoken
from
the
heart
and
delineated
a
picture
of
the
sweet
courtesies
of
family
kindness
emily
sat
by
her
father
holding
his
hand
and
while
she
listened
to
the
old
man
her
heart
swelled
with
the
affectionate
sympathy
he
described
and
her
tears
fell
to
the
mournful
consideration
that
death
would
probably
soon
deprive
her
of
the
dearest
blessing
she
then
possessed
the
soft
moonlight
of
an
autumnal
evening
and
the
distant
music
which
now
sounded
a
plaintive
strain
aided
the
melancholy
of
her
mind
the
old
man
continued
to
talk
of
his
family
and
st
aubert
remained
silent
â€œi
have
only
one
daughter
livingâ€
said
la
voisin
â€œbut
she
is
happily
married
and
is
everything
to
me
when
i
lost
my
wifeâ€
he
added
with
a
sigh
â€œi
came
to
live
with
agnes
and
her
family
she
has
several
children
who
are
all
dancing
on
the
green
yonder
as
merry
as
grasshoppersâ€”and
long
may
they
be
so
i
hope
to
die
among
them
monsieur
i
am
old
now
and
cannot
expect
to
live
long
but
there
is
some
comfort
in
dying
surrounded
by
oneâ€™s
childrenâ€
â€œmy
good
friendâ€
said
st
aubert
while
his
voice
trembled
â€œi
hope
you
will
long
live
surrounded
by
themâ€
â€œah
sir
at
my
age
i
must
not
expect
thatâ€
replied
the
old
man
and
he
paused
â€œi
can
scarcely
wish
itâ€
he
resumed
â€œfor
i
trust
that
whenever
i
die
i
shall
go
to
heaven
where
my
poor
wife
is
gone
before
me
i
can
sometimes
almost
fancy
i
see
her
of
a
still
moonlight
night
walking
among
these
shades
she
loved
so
well
do
you
believe
monsieur
that
we
shall
be
permitted
to
revisit
the
earth
after
we
have
quitted
the
bodyâ€
emily
could
no
longer
stifle
the
anguish
of
her
heart
her
tears
fell
fast
upon
her
fatherâ€™s
hand
which
she
yet
held
he
made
an
effort
to
speak
and
at
length
said
in
a
low
voice
â€œi
hope
we
shall
be
permitted
to
look
down
on
those
we
have
left
on
the
earth
but
i
can
only
hope
it
futurity
is
much
veiled
from
our
eyes
and
faith
and
hope
are
our
only
guides
concerning
it
we
are
not
enjoined
to
believe
that
disembodied
spirits
watch
over
the
friends
they
have
loved
but
we
may
innocently
hope
it
it
is
a
hope
which
i
will
never
resignâ€
continued
he
while
he
wiped
the
tears
from
his
daughterâ€™s
eyes
â€œit
will
sweeten
the
bitter
moments
of
deathâ€
tears
fell
slowly
on
his
cheeks
la
voisin
wept
too
and
there
was
a
pause
of
silence
then
la
voisin
renewing
the
subject
said
â€œbut
you
believe
sir
that
we
shall
meet
in
another
world
the
relations
we
have
loved
in
this
i
must
believe
thisâ€
â€œthen
do
believe
itâ€
replied
st
aubert
â€œsevere
indeed
would
be
the
pangs
of
separation
if
we
believed
it
to
be
eternal
look
up
my
dear
emily
we
shall
meet
againâ€
he
lifted
his
eyes
towards
heaven
and
a
gleam
of
moonlight
which
fell
upon
his
countenance
discovered
peace
and
resignation
stealing
on
the
lines
of
sorrow
la
voisin
felt
that
he
had
pursued
the
subject
too
far
and
he
dropped
it
saying
â€œwe
are
in
darkness
i
forgot
to
bring
a
lightâ€
â€œnoâ€
said
st
aubert
â€œthis
is
a
light
i
love
sit
down
my
good
friend
emily
my
love
i
find
myself
better
than
i
have
been
all
day
this
air
refreshes
me
i
can
enjoy
this
tranquil
hour
and
that
music
which
floats
so
sweetly
at
a
distance
let
me
see
you
smile
who
touches
that
guitar
so
tastefully
are
there
two
instruments
or
is
it
an
echo
i
hearâ€
â€œit
is
an
echo
monsieur
i
fancy
that
guitar
is
often
heard
at
night
when
all
is
still
but
nobody
knows
who
touches
it
and
it
is
sometimes
accompanied
by
a
voice
so
sweet
and
so
sad
one
would
almost
think
the
woods
were
hauntedâ€
â€œthey
certainly
are
hauntedâ€
said
st
aubert
with
a
smile
â€œbut
i
believe
it
is
by
mortalsâ€
â€œi
have
sometimes
heard
it
at
midnight
when
i
could
not
sleepâ€
rejoined
la
voisin
not
seeming
to
notice
this
remark
â€œalmost
under
my
window
and
i
never
heard
any
music
like
it
it
has
often
made
me
think
of
my
poor
wife
till
i
cried
i
have
sometimes
got
up
to
the
window
to
look
if
i
could
see
anybody
but
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
casement
all
was
hushed
and
nobody
to
be
seen
and
i
have
listened
and
listened
till
i
have
been
so
timorous
that
even
the
trembling
of
the
leaves
in
the
breeze
has
made
me
start
they
say
it
often
comes
to
warn
people
of
their
death
but
i
have
heard
it
these
many
years
and
outlived
the
warningâ€
emily
though
she
smiled
at
the
mention
of
this
ridiculous
superstition
could
not
in
the
present
tone
of
her
spirits
wholly
resist
its
contagion
â€œwell
but
my
good
friendâ€
said
st
aubert
â€œhas
nobody
had
courage
to
follow
the
sounds
if
they
had
they
would
probably
have
discovered
who
is
the
musicianâ€
â€œyes
sir
they
have
followed
them
some
way
into
the
woods
but
the
music
has
still
retreated
and
seemed
as
distant
as
ever
and
the
people
have
at
last
been
afraid
of
being
led
into
harm
and
would
go
no
further
it
is
very
seldom
that
i
have
heard
these
sounds
so
early
in
the
evening
they
usually
come
about
midnight
when
that
bright
planet
which
is
rising
above
the
turret
yonder
sets
below
the
woods
on
the
leftâ€
â€œwhat
turretâ€
asked
st
aubert
with
quickness
â€œi
see
noneâ€
â€œyour
pardon
monsieur
you
do
see
one
indeed
for
the
moon
shines
full
upon
itâ€”up
the
avenue
yonder
a
long
way
off
the
chã¢teau
it
belongs
to
is
hid
among
the
treesâ€
â€œyes
my
dear
sirâ€
said
emily
pointing
â€œdonâ€™t
you
see
something
glitter
above
the
dark
woods
it
is
a
fane
i
fancy
which
the
rays
fall
uponâ€
â€œo
yes
i
see
what
you
mean
and
who
does
the
chã¢teau
belong
toâ€
â€œthe
marquis
de
villeroi
was
its
ownerâ€
replied
la
voisin
emphatically
â€œahâ€
said
st
aubert
with
a
deep
sigh
â€œare
we
then
so
near
le-blancâ€
he
appeared
much
agitated
â€œit
used
to
be
the
marquisâ€™s
favourite
residenceâ€
resumed
la
voisin
â€œbut
he
took
a
dislike
to
the
place
and
has
not
been
there
for
many
years
we
have
heard
lately
that
he
is
dead
and
that
it
is
fallen
into
other
handsâ€
st
aubert
who
had
sat
in
deep
musing
was
roused
by
the
last
words
â€œdeadâ€
he
exclaimed
â€œgood
god
when
did
he
dieâ€
â€œhe
is
reported
to
have
died
about
five
weeks
sinceâ€
replied
la
voisin
â€œdid
you
know
the
marquis
sirâ€
â€œthis
is
very
extraordinaryâ€
said
st
aubert
without
attending
to
the
question
â€œwhy
is
it
so
my
dear
sirâ€
said
emily
in
a
voice
of
timid
curiosity
he
made
no
reply
but
sunk
again
into
a
reverie
and
in
a
few
moments
when
he
seemed
to
have
recovered
himself
asked
who
had
succeeded
to
the
estates
â€œi
have
forgot
his
title
monsieurâ€
said
la
voisin
â€œbut
my
lord
resides
at
paris
chiefly
i
hear
no
talk
of
his
coming
hitherâ€
â€œthe
chã¢teau
is
shut
up
then
stillâ€
â€œwhy
little
better
sir
the
old
housekeeper
and
her
husband
the
steward
have
the
care
of
it
but
they
live
generally
in
a
cottage
hard
byâ€
â€œthe
chã¢teau
is
spacious
i
supposeâ€
said
emily
â€œand
must
be
desolate
for
the
residence
of
only
two
personsâ€
â€œdesolate
enough
mademoiselleâ€
replied
la
voisin
â€œi
would
not
pass
one
night
in
the
chã¢teau
for
the
value
of
the
whole
domainâ€
â€œwhat
is
thatâ€
said
st
aubert
roused
again
from
thoughtfulness
as
his
host
repeated
his
last
sentence
a
groan
escaped
from
st
aubert
and
then
as
if
anxious
to
prevent
it
from
being
noticed
he
hastily
asked
la
voisin
how
long
he
had
lived
in
this
neighbourhood
â€œalmost
from
my
childhood
sirâ€
replied
his
host
â€œyou
remember
the
late
marchioness
thenâ€
said
st
aubert
in
an
altered
voice
â€œah
monsieurâ€”that
i
do
well
there
are
many
besides
me
who
remember
herâ€
â€œyesâ€”â€
said
st
aubert
â€œand
i
am
one
of
thoseâ€
â€œalas
sir
you
remember
then
a
most
beautiful
and
excellent
lady
she
deserved
a
better
fateâ€
tears
stood
in
st
aubertâ€™s
eyes
â€œenoughâ€
said
he
in
a
voice
almost
stifled
by
the
violence
of
his
emotionsâ€”â€œit
is
enough
my
friendâ€
emily
though
extremely
surprised
by
her
fatherâ€™s
manner
forbore
to
express
her
feelings
by
any
question
la
voisin
began
to
apologise
but
st
aubert
interrupted
him
â€œapology
is
quite
unnecessaryâ€
said
he
â€œlet
us
change
the
topic
you
were
speaking
of
the
music
we
just
now
heardâ€
â€œi
was
monsieurâ€”but
harkâ€”it
comes
again
listen
to
that
voiceâ€
they
were
all
silent
at
last
a
soft
and
solemn-breathing
sound
rose
like
a
stream
of
rich
distilled
perfumes
and
stole
upon
the
air
that
even
silence
was
took
ere
she
was
â€™ware
and
wished
she
might
deny
her
nature
and
be
never
more
still
to
be
so
displaced
milton
in
a
few
moments
the
voice
died
into
air
and
the
instrument
which
had
been
heard
before
sounded
in
low
symphony
st
aubert
now
observed
that
it
produced
a
tone
much
more
full
and
melodious
than
that
of
a
guitar
and
still
more
melancholy
and
soft
than
the
lute
they
continued
to
listen
but
the
sounds
returned
no
more
â€œthis
is
strangeâ€
said
st
aubert
at
length
interrupting
the
silence
â€œvery
strangeâ€
said
emily
â€œit
is
soâ€
rejoined
la
voisin
and
they
were
again
silent
after
a
long
pause
â€œit
is
now
about
eighteen
years
since
i
first
heard
that
musicâ€
said
la
voisin
â€œi
remember
it
was
on
a
fine
summerâ€™s
night
much
like
this
but
later
that
i
was
walking
in
the
woods
and
alone
i
remember
too
that
my
spirits
were
very
low
for
one
of
my
boys
was
ill
and
we
feared
we
should
lose
him
i
had
been
watching
at
his
bedside
all
the
evening
while
his
mother
slept
for
she
had
sat
up
with
him
the
night
before
i
had
been
watching
and
went
out
for
a
little
fresh
air
the
day
had
been
very
sultry
as
i
walked
under
the
shades
and
mused
i
heard
music
at
a
distance
and
thought
it
was
claude
playing
upon
his
flute
as
he
often
did
of
a
fine
evening
at
the
cottage
door
but
when
i
came
to
a
place
where
the
trees
opened
i
shall
never
forget
it
and
stood
looking
up
at
the
north-lights
which
shot
up
the
heaven
to
a
great
height
i
heard
all
of
a
sudden
such
soundsâ€”they
came
so
as
i
cannot
describe
it
was
like
the
music
of
angels
and
i
looked
up
again
almost
expecting
to
see
them
in
the
sky
when
i
came
home
i
told
what
i
had
heard
but
they
laughed
at
me
and
said
it
must
be
some
of
the
shepherds
playing
on
their
pipes
and
i
could
not
persuade
them
to
the
contrary
a
few
nights
after
however
my
wife
herself
heard
the
same
sounds
and
was
as
much
surprised
as
i
was
and
father
denis
frightened
her
sadly
by
saying
that
it
was
music
come
to
warn
her
of
her
childâ€™s
death
and
that
music
often
came
to
houses
where
there
was
a
dying
personâ€
emily
on
hearing
this
shrunk
with
a
superstitious
dread
entirely
new
to
her
and
could
scarcely
conceal
her
agitation
from
st
aubert
â€œbut
the
boy
lived
monsieur
in
spite
of
father
denisâ€
â€œfather
denisâ€
said
st
aubert
who
had
listened
to
â€˜narrative
old
ageâ€™
with
patient
attention
â€œare
we
near
a
convent
thenâ€
â€œyes
sir
the
convent
of
st
clair
stands
at
no
great
distance
on
the
sea
shore
yonderâ€
â€œahâ€
said
st
aubert
as
if
struck
with
some
sudden
remembrance
â€œthe
convent
of
st
clairâ€
emily
observed
the
clouds
of
grief
mingled
with
a
faint
expression
of
horror
gathering
on
his
brow
his
countenance
became
fixed
and
touched
as
it
now
was
by
the
silver
whiteness
of
the
moonlight
he
resembled
one
of
those
marble
statues
of
a
monument
which
seem
to
bend
in
hopeless
sorrow
over
the
ashes
of
the
dead
shown
by
the
blunted
light
that
the
dim
moon
through
painted
casements
lends
the
emigrants
â€œbut
my
dear
sirâ€
said
emily
anxious
to
dissipate
his
thoughts
â€œyou
forget
that
repose
is
necessary
to
you
if
our
kind
host
will
give
me
leave
i
will
prepare
your
bed
for
i
know
how
you
like
it
to
be
madeâ€
st
aubert
recollecting
himself
and
smiling
affectionately
desired
she
would
not
add
to
her
fatigue
by
that
attention
and
la
voisin
whose
consideration
for
his
guest
had
been
suspended
by
the
interests
which
his
own
narrative
had
recalled
now
started
from
his
seat
and
apologising
for
not
having
called
agnes
from
the
green
hurried
out
of
the
room
in
a
few
moments
he
returned
with
his
daughter
a
young
woman
of
pleasing
countenance
and
emily
learned
from
her
what
she
had
not
before
suspected
that
for
their
accommodation
it
was
necessary
part
of
la
voisinâ€™s
family
should
leave
their
beds
she
lamented
this
circumstance
but
agnes
by
her
reply
fully
proved
that
she
inherited
at
least
a
share
of
her
fatherâ€™s
courteous
hospitality
it
was
settled
that
some
of
her
children
and
michael
should
sleep
in
the
neighbouring
cottage
â€œif
i
am
better
tomorrow
my
dearâ€
said
st
aubert
when
emily
returned
to
him
â€œi
mean
to
set
out
at
an
early
hour
that
we
may
rest
during
the
heat
of
the
day
and
will
travel
towards
home
in
the
present
state
of
my
health
and
spirits
i
cannot
look
on
a
longer
journey
with
pleasure
and
i
am
also
very
anxious
to
reach
la
vallã©eâ€
emily
though
she
also
desired
to
return
was
grieved
at
her
fatherâ€™s
sudden
wish
to
do
so
which
she
thought
indicated
a
greater
degree
of
indisposition
than
he
would
acknowledge
st
aubert
now
retired
to
rest
and
emily
to
her
little
chamber
but
not
to
immediate
repose
her
thoughts
returned
to
the
late
conversation
concerning
the
state
of
departed
spirits
a
subject
at
this
time
particularly
affecting
to
her
when
she
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
her
dear
father
would
ere
long
be
numbered
with
them
she
leaned
pensively
on
the
little
open
casement
and
in
deep
thought
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
heaven
whose
blue
unclouded
concave
was
studded
thick
with
stars
the
worlds
perhaps
of
spirits
unsphered
of
mortal
mould
as
her
eyes
wandered
along
the
boundless
ã¦ther
her
thoughts
rose
as
before
towards
the
sublimity
of
the
deity
and
to
the
contemplation
of
futurity
no
busy
note
of
this
world
interrupted
the
course
of
her
mind
the
merry
dance
had
ceased
and
every
cottager
had
retired
to
his
home
the
still
air
seemed
scarcely
to
breathe
upon
the
woods
and
now
and
then
the
distant
sound
of
a
solitary
sheep-bell
or
of
a
closing
casement
was
all
that
broke
on
silence
at
length
even
this
hint
of
human
being
was
heard
no
more
elevated
and
enwrapt
while
her
eyes
were
often
wet
with
tears
of
sublime
devotion
and
solemn
awe
she
continued
at
the
casement
till
the
gloom
of
midnight
hung
over
the
earth
and
the
planet
which
la
voisin
had
pointed
out
sunk
below
the
woods
she
then
recollected
what
he
had
said
concerning
this
planet
and
the
mysterious
music
and
as
she
lingered
at
the
window
half
hoping
and
half
fearing
that
it
would
return
her
mind
was
led
to
the
remembrance
of
the
extreme
emotion
her
father
had
shown
on
mention
of
the
marquis
la
villeroiâ€™s
death
and
of
the
fate
of
the
marchioness
and
she
felt
strongly
interested
concerning
the
remote
cause
of
this
emotion
her
surprise
and
curiosity
were
indeed
the
greater
because
she
did
not
recollect
ever
to
have
heard
him
mention
the
name
of
villeroi
no
music
however
stole
on
the
silence
of
the
night
and
emily
perceiving
the
lateness
of
the
hour
returned
to
a
scene
of
fatigue
remembered
that
she
was
to
rise
early
in
the
morning
and
withdrew
from
the
window
to
repose
let
those
deplore
their
doom
whose
hope
still
grovels
in
this
dark
sojourn
but
lofty
souls
can
look
beyond
the
tomb
can
smile
at
fate
and
wonder
how
they
mourn
shall
spring
to
these
sad
scenes
no
more
return
is
yonder
wave
the
sunâ€™s
eternal
bedâ€”
soon
shall
the
orient
with
new
lustre
burn
and
spring
shall
soon
her
vital
influence
shed
again
attune
the
grove
again
adorn
the
mead
beattie
emily
called
as
she
had
requested
at
an
early
hour
awoke
little
refreshed
by
sleep
for
uneasy
dreams
had
pursued
her
and
marred
the
kindest
blessing
of
the
unhappy
but
when
she
opened
her
casement
looked
out
upon
the
woods
bright
with
the
morning
sun
and
inspired
the
pure
air
her
mind
was
soothed
the
scene
was
filled
with
that
cheering
freshness
which
seems
to
breathe
the
very
spirit
of
health
and
she
heard
only
sweet
and
picturesque
sounds
if
such
an
expression
may
be
allowedâ€”the
matin-bell
of
a
distant
convent
the
faint
murmur
of
the
sea-waves
the
song
of
birds
and
the
far-off
low
of
cattle
which
she
saw
coming
slowly
on
between
the
trunks
of
trees
struck
with
the
circumstances
of
imagery
around
her
she
indulged
the
pensive
tranquillity
which
they
inspired
and
while
she
leaned
on
her
window
waiting
till
st
aubert
should
descend
to
breakfast
her
ideas
arranged
themselves
in
the
following
lines
the
first
hour
of
morning
how
sweet
to
wind
the
forestâ€™s
tangled
shade
when
early
twilight
from
the
eastern
bound
dawns
on
the
sleeping
landscape
in
the
glade
and
fades
as
morning
spreads
her
blush
around
when
evâ€™ry
infant
flower
that
wept
in
night
lifts
its
chill
head
soft
glowing
with
a
tear
expands
its
tender
blossom
to
the
light
and
gives
its
incense
to
the
genial
air
how
fresh
the
breeze
that
wafts
the
rich
perfume
and
swells
the
melody
of
waking
birds
the
hum
of
bees
beneath
the
verdant
gloom
and
woodmanâ€™s
song
and
low
of
distant
herds
then
doubtful
gleams
the
mountainâ€™s
hoary
head
seen
through
the
parting
foliage
from
afar
and
farther
still
the
oceanâ€™s
misty
bed
with
flitting
sails
that
partial
sunbeams
share
but
vain
the
sylvan
shadeâ€”the
breath
of
may
the
voice
of
music
floating
on
the
gale
and
forms
that
beam
through
morningâ€™s
dewy
veil
if
health
no
longer
bid
the
heart
be
gay
o
balmy
hour
â€™tis
thine
her
wealth
to
give
here
spread
her
blush
and
bid
the
parent
live
emily
now
heard
persons
moving
below
in
the
cottage
and
presently
the
voice
of
michael
who
was
talking
to
his
mules
as
he
led
them
forth
from
a
hut
adjoining
as
she
left
her
room
st
aubert
who
was
now
risen
met
her
at
the
door
apparently
as
little
restored
by
sleep
as
herself
she
led
him
down
stairs
to
the
little
parlour
in
which
they
had
supped
on
the
preceding
night
where
they
found
a
neat
breakfast
set
out
while
the
host
and
his
daughter
waited
to
bid
them
good-morrow
â€œi
envy
you
this
cottage
my
good
friendsâ€
said
st
aubert
as
he
met
them
â€œit
is
so
pleasant
so
quiet
and
so
neat
and
this
air
that
one
breathesâ€”if
anything
could
restore
lost
health
it
would
surely
be
this
airâ€
la
voisin
bowed
gratefully
and
replied
with
the
gallantry
of
a
frenchman
â€œour
cottage
may
be
envied
sir
since
you
and
mademoiselle
have
honoured
it
with
your
presenceâ€
st
aubert
gave
him
a
friendly
smile
for
his
compliment
and
sat
down
to
a
table
spread
with
cream
fruit
new
cheese
butter
and
coffee
emily
who
had
observed
her
father
with
attention
and
thought
he
looked
very
ill
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
to
defer
travelling
till
the
afternoon
but
he
seemed
very
anxious
to
be
at
home
and
his
anxiety
he
expressed
repeatedly
and
with
an
earnestness
that
was
unusual
with
him
he
now
said
he
found
himself
as
well
as
he
had
been
of
late
and
that
he
could
bear
travelling
better
in
the
cool
hour
of
the
morning
than
at
any
other
time
but
while
he
was
talking
with
his
venerable
host
and
thanking
him
for
his
kind
attentions
emily
observed
his
countenance
change
and
before
she
could
reach
him
he
fell
back
in
his
chair
in
a
few
moments
he
recovered
from
the
sudden
faintness
that
had
come
over
him
but
felt
so
ill
that
he
perceived
himself
unable
to
set
out
and
having
remained
a
little
while
struggling
against
the
pressure
of
indisposition
he
begged
he
might
be
helped
up
stairs
to
bed
this
request
renewed
all
the
terror
which
emily
had
suffered
on
the
preceding
evening
but
though
scarcely
able
to
support
herself
under
the
sudden
shock
it
gave
her
she
tried
to
conceal
her
apprehensions
from
st
aubert
and
gave
her
trembling
arm
to
assist
him
to
the
door
of
his
chamber
when
he
was
once
more
in
bed
he
desired
that
emily
who
was
then
weeping
in
her
own
room
might
be
called
and
as
she
came
he
waved
his
hand
for
every
other
person
to
quit
the
apartment
when
they
were
alone
he
held
out
his
hand
to
her
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
countenance
with
an
expression
so
full
of
tenderness
and
grief
that
all
her
fortitude
forsook
her
and
she
burst
into
an
agony
of
tears
st
aubert
seemed
struggling
to
acquire
firmness
but
was
still
unable
to
speak
he
could
only
press
her
hand
and
check
the
tears
that
stood
trembling
in
his
eyes
at
length
he
commanded
his
voice
â€œmy
dear
childâ€
said
he
trying
to
smile
through
his
anguish
â€œmy
dear
emilyâ€â€”and
paused
again
he
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
as
if
in
prayer
and
then
in
a
firmer
tone
and
with
a
look
in
which
the
tenderness
of
the
father
was
dignified
by
the
pious
solemnity
of
the
saint
he
said
â€œmy
dear
child
i
would
soften
the
painful
truth
i
have
to
tell
you
but
i
find
myself
quite
unequal
to
the
art
alas
i
would
at
this
moment
conceal
it
from
you
but
that
it
would
be
most
cruel
to
deceive
you
it
cannot
be
long
before
we
must
part
let
us
talk
of
it
that
our
thoughts
and
our
prayers
may
prepare
us
to
bear
itâ€
his
voice
faltered
while
emily
still
weeping
pressed
his
hand
close
to
her
heart
which
swelled
with
a
convulsive
sigh
but
she
could
not
look
up
â€œlet
me
not
waste
these
momentsâ€
said
st
aubert
recovering
himself
â€œi
have
much
to
say
there
is
a
circumstance
of
solemn
consequence
which
i
have
to
mention
and
a
solemn
promise
to
obtain
from
you
when
this
is
done
i
shall
be
easier
you
have
observed
my
dear
how
anxious
i
am
to
reach
home
but
know
not
all
my
reasons
for
this
listen
to
what
i
am
going
to
sayâ€”yet
stayâ€”before
i
say
more
give
me
this
promise
a
promise
made
to
your
dying
fatherâ€â€”st
aubert
was
interrupted
emily
struck
by
his
last
words
as
if
for
the
first
time
with
a
conviction
of
his
immediate
danger
raised
her
head
her
tears
stopped
and
gazing
at
him
for
a
moment
with
an
expression
of
unutterable
anguish
a
slight
convulsion
seized
her
and
she
sunk
senseless
in
her
chair
st
aubertâ€™s
cries
brought
la
voisin
and
his
daughter
to
the
room
and
they
administered
every
means
in
their
power
to
restore
her
but
for
a
considerable
time
without
effect
when
she
recovered
st
aubert
was
so
exhausted
by
the
scene
he
had
witnessed
that
it
was
many
minutes
before
he
had
strength
to
speak
he
was
however
somewhat
revived
by
a
cordial
which
emily
gave
him
and
being
again
alone
with
her
he
exerted
himself
to
tranquilize
her
spirits
and
to
offer
her
all
the
comfort
of
which
her
situation
admitted
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
wept
on
his
neck
and
grief
made
her
so
insensible
to
all
he
said
that
he
ceased
to
offer
the
alleviations
which
he
himself
could
not
at
this
moment
feel
and
mingled
his
silent
tears
with
hers
recalled
at
length
to
a
sense
of
duty
she
tried
to
spare
her
father
from
a
farther
view
of
her
suffering
and
quitting
his
embrace
dried
her
tears
and
said
something
which
she
meant
for
consolation
â€œmy
dear
emilyâ€
replied
st
aubert
â€œmy
dear
child
we
must
look
up
with
humble
confidence
to
that
being
who
has
protected
and
comforted
us
in
every
danger
and
in
every
affliction
we
have
known
to
whose
eye
every
moment
of
our
lives
has
been
exposed
he
will
not
he
does
not
forsake
us
now
i
feel
his
consolations
in
my
heart
i
shall
leave
you
my
child
still
in
his
care
and
though
i
depart
from
this
world
i
shall
be
still
in
his
presence
nay
weep
not
again
my
emily
in
death
there
is
nothing
new
or
surprising
since
we
all
know
that
we
are
born
to
die
and
nothing
terrible
to
those
who
can
confide
in
an
all-powerful
god
had
my
life
been
spared
now
after
a
very
few
years
in
the
course
of
nature
i
must
have
resigned
it
old
age
with
all
its
train
of
infirmity
its
privations
and
its
sorrows
would
have
been
mine
and
then
at
last
death
would
have
come
and
called
forth
the
tears
you
now
shed
rather
my
child
rejoice
that
i
am
saved
from
such
suffering
and
that
i
am
permitted
to
die
with
a
mind
unimpaired
and
sensible
of
the
comforts
of
faith
and
resignationâ€
st
aubert
paused
fatigued
with
speaking
emily
again
endeavoured
to
assume
an
air
of
composure
and
in
replying
to
what
he
had
said
tried
to
sooth
him
with
a
belief
that
he
had
not
spoken
in
vain
when
he
had
reposed
a
while
he
resumed
the
conversation
â€œlet
me
returnâ€
said
he
â€œto
a
subject
which
is
very
near
my
heart
i
said
i
had
a
solemn
promise
to
receive
from
you
let
me
receive
it
now
before
i
explain
the
chief
circumstance
which
it
concerns
there
are
others
of
which
your
peace
requires
that
you
should
rest
in
ignorance
promise
then
that
you
will
perform
exactly
what
i
shall
enjoinâ€
emily
awed
by
the
earnest
solemnity
of
his
manner
dried
her
tears
that
had
begun
again
to
flow
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
suppress
them
and
looking
eloquently
at
st
aubert
bound
herself
to
do
whatever
he
should
require
by
a
vow
at
which
she
shuddered
yet
knew
not
why
he
proceeded
â€œi
know
you
too
well
my
emily
to
believe
that
you
would
break
any
promise
much
less
one
thus
solemnly
given
your
assurance
gives
me
peace
and
the
observance
of
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
your
tranquillity
hear
then
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
closet
which
adjoins
my
chamber
at
la
vallã©e
has
a
sliding
board
in
the
floor
you
will
know
it
by
a
remarkable
knot
in
the
wood
and
by
its
being
the
next
board
except
one
to
the
wainscot
which
fronts
the
door
at
the
distance
of
about
a
yard
from
that
end
nearer
the
window
you
will
perceive
a
line
across
it
as
if
the
plank
had
been
joinedâ€”the
way
to
open
it
is
thisâ€”press
your
foot
upon
the
line
the
end
of
the
board
will
then
sink
and
you
may
slide
it
with
ease
beneath
the
other
below
you
will
see
a
hollow
placeâ€
st
aubert
paused
for
breath
and
emily
sat
fixed
in
deep
attention
â€œdo
you
understand
these
directions
my
dearâ€
said
he
emily
though
scarcely
able
to
speak
assured
him
that
she
did
â€œwhen
you
return
home
thenâ€
he
added
with
a
deep
sighâ€”
at
the
mention
of
her
return
home
all
the
melancholy
circumstances
that
must
attend
this
return
rushed
upon
her
fancy
she
burst
into
convulsive
grief
and
st
aubert
himself
affected
beyond
the
resistance
of
the
fortitude
which
he
had
at
first
summoned
wept
with
her
after
some
moments
he
composed
himself
â€œmy
dear
childâ€
said
he
â€œbe
comforted
when
i
am
gone
you
will
not
be
forsakenâ€”i
leave
you
only
in
the
more
immediate
care
of
that
providence
which
has
never
yet
forsaken
me
do
not
afflict
me
with
this
excess
of
grief
rather
teach
me
by
your
example
to
bear
my
ownâ€
he
stopped
again
and
emily
the
more
she
endeavoured
to
restrain
her
emotion
found
it
the
less
possible
to
do
so
st
aubert
who
now
spoke
with
pain
resumed
the
subject
â€œthat
closet
my
dearâ€”when
you
return
home
go
to
it
and
beneath
the
board
i
have
described
you
will
find
a
packet
of
written
papers
attend
to
me
now
for
the
promise
you
have
given
particularly
relates
to
what
i
shall
direct
these
papers
you
must
burnâ€”and
solemnly
i
command
you
without
examining
themâ€
emilyâ€™s
surprise
for
a
moment
overcame
her
grief
and
she
ventured
to
ask
why
this
must
be
st
aubert
replied
that
if
it
had
been
right
for
him
to
explain
his
reasons
her
late
promise
would
have
been
unnecessarily
exacted
â€œit
is
sufficient
for
you
my
love
to
have
a
deep
sense
of
the
importance
of
observing
me
in
this
instanceâ€
st
aubert
proceeded
â€œunder
that
board
you
will
also
find
about
two
hundred
louis
dâ€™ors
wrapped
in
a
silk
purse
indeed
it
was
to
secure
whatever
money
might
be
in
the
chã¢teau
that
this
secret
place
was
contrived
at
a
time
when
the
province
was
over-run
by
troops
of
men
who
took
advantage
of
the
tumults
and
became
plunderers
â€œbut
i
have
yet
another
promise
to
receive
from
you
which
isâ€”that
you
will
never
whatever
may
be
your
future
circumstances
sell
the
chã¢teauâ€
st
aubert
even
enjoined
her
whenever
she
might
marry
to
make
it
an
article
in
the
contract
that
the
chã¢teau
should
always
be
hers
he
then
gave
her
a
more
minute
account
of
his
present
circumstances
than
he
had
yet
done
adding
â€œthe
two
hundred
louis
with
what
money
you
will
now
find
in
my
purse
is
all
the
ready
money
i
have
to
leave
you
i
have
told
you
how
i
am
circumstanced
with
m
motteville
at
paris
ah
my
child
i
leave
you
poorâ€”but
not
destituteâ€
he
added
after
a
long
pause
emily
could
make
no
reply
to
anything
he
now
said
but
knelt
at
the
bedside
with
her
face
upon
the
quilt
weeping
over
the
hand
she
held
there
after
this
conversation
the
mind
of
st
aubert
appeared
to
be
much
more
at
ease
but
exhausted
by
the
effort
of
speaking
he
sunk
into
a
kind
of
doze
and
emily
continued
to
watch
and
weep
beside
him
till
a
gentle
tap
at
the
chamber-door
roused
her
it
was
la
voisin
come
to
say
that
a
confessor
from
the
neighbouring
convent
was
below
ready
to
attend
st
aubert
emily
would
not
suffer
her
father
to
be
disturbed
but
desired
that
the
priest
might
not
leave
the
cottage
when
st
aubert
awoke
from
this
doze
his
senses
were
confused
and
it
was
some
moments
before
he
recovered
them
sufficiently
to
know
that
it
was
emily
who
sat
beside
him
he
then
moved
his
lips
and
stretched
forth
his
hand
to
her
as
she
received
which
she
sunk
back
in
her
chair
overcome
by
the
impression
of
death
on
his
countenance
in
a
few
minutes
he
recovered
his
voice
and
emily
then
asked
if
he
wished
to
see
the
confessor
he
replied
that
he
did
and
when
the
holy
father
appeared
she
withdrew
they
remained
alone
together
above
half
an
hour
when
emily
was
called
in
she
found
st
aubert
more
agitated
than
when
she
had
left
him
and
she
gazed
with
a
slight
degree
of
resentment
at
the
friar
as
the
cause
of
this
who
however
looked
mildly
and
mournfully
at
her
and
turned
away
st
aubert
in
a
tremulous
voice
said
he
wished
her
to
join
in
prayer
with
him
and
asked
if
la
voisin
would
do
so
too
the
old
man
and
his
daughter
came
they
both
wept
and
knelt
with
emily
round
the
bed
while
the
holy
father
read
in
a
solemn
voice
the
service
for
the
dying
st
aubert
lay
with
a
serene
countenance
and
seemed
to
join
fervently
in
the
devotion
while
tears
often
stole
from
beneath
his
closed
eyelids
and
emilyâ€™s
sobs
more
than
once
interrupted
the
service
when
it
was
concluded
and
extreme
unction
had
been
administered
the
friar
withdrew
st
aubert
then
made
a
sign
for
la
voisin
to
come
nearer
he
gave
him
his
hand
and
was
for
a
moment
silent
at
length
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
â€œmy
good
friend
our
acquaintance
has
been
short
but
long
enough
to
give
you
an
opportunity
of
showing
me
much
kind
attention
i
cannot
doubt
that
you
will
extend
this
kindness
to
my
daughter
when
i
am
gone
she
will
have
need
of
it
i
entrust
her
to
your
care
during
the
few
days
she
will
remain
here
i
need
say
no
moreâ€”you
know
the
feelings
of
a
father
for
you
have
children
mine
would
be
indeed
severe
if
i
had
less
confidence
in
youâ€
he
paused
la
voisin
assured
him
and
his
tears
bore
testimony
to
his
sincerity
that
he
would
do
all
he
could
to
soften
her
affliction
and
that
if
st
aubert
wished
it
he
would
even
attend
her
into
gascony
an
offer
so
pleasing
to
st
aubert
that
he
had
scarcely
words
to
acknowledge
his
sense
of
the
old
manâ€™s
kindness
or
to
tell
him
that
he
accepted
it
the
scene
that
followed
between
st
aubert
and
emily
affected
la
voisin
so
much
that
he
quitted
the
chamber
and
she
was
again
left
alone
with
her
father
whose
spirits
seemed
fainting
fast
but
neither
his
senses
nor
his
voice
yet
failed
him
and
at
intervals
he
employed
much
of
these
last
awful
moments
in
advising
his
daughter
as
to
her
future
conduct
perhaps
he
never
had
thought
more
justly
or
expressed
himself
more
clearly
than
he
did
now
â€œabove
all
my
dear
emilyâ€
said
he
â€œdo
not
indulge
in
the
pride
of
fine
feeling
the
romantic
error
of
amiable
minds
those
who
really
possess
sensibility
ought
early
to
be
taught
that
it
is
a
dangerous
quality
which
is
continually
extracting
the
excess
of
misery
or
delight
from
every
surrounding
circumstance
and
since
in
our
passage
through
this
world
painful
circumstances
occur
more
frequently
than
pleasing
ones
and
since
our
sense
of
evil
is
i
fear
more
acute
than
our
sense
of
good
we
become
the
victims
of
our
feelings
unless
we
can
in
some
degree
command
them
i
know
you
will
say
for
you
are
young
my
emily
i
know
you
will
say
that
you
are
contented
sometimes
to
suffer
rather
than
to
give
up
your
refined
sense
of
happiness
at
others
but
when
your
mind
has
been
long
harassed
by
vicissitude
you
will
be
content
to
rest
and
you
will
then
recover
from
your
delusion
you
will
perceive
that
the
phantom
of
happiness
is
exchanged
for
the
substance
for
happiness
arises
in
a
state
of
peace
not
of
tumult
it
is
of
a
temperate
and
uniform
nature
and
can
no
more
exist
in
a
heart
that
is
continually
alive
to
minute
circumstances
than
in
one
that
is
dead
to
feeling
you
see
my
dear
that
though
i
would
guard
you
against
the
dangers
of
sensibility
i
am
not
an
advocate
for
apathy
at
your
age
i
should
have
said
that
is
a
vice
more
hateful
than
all
the
errors
of
sensibility
and
i
say
so
still
i
call
it
a
vice
because
it
leads
to
positive
evil
in
this
however
it
does
no
more
than
an
ill-governed
sensibility
which
by
such
a
rule
might
also
be
called
a
vice
but
the
evil
of
the
former
is
of
more
general
consequence
i
have
exhausted
myselfâ€
said
st
aubert
feebly
â€œand
have
wearied
you
my
emily
but
on
a
subject
so
important
to
your
future
comfort
i
am
anxious
to
be
perfectly
understoodâ€
emily
assured
him
that
his
advice
was
most
precious
to
her
and
that
she
would
never
forget
it
or
cease
from
endeavouring
to
profit
by
it
st
aubert
smiled
affectionately
and
sorrowfully
upon
her
â€œi
repeat
itâ€
said
he
â€œi
would
not
teach
you
to
become
insensible
if
i
could
i
would
only
warn
you
of
the
evils
of
susceptibility
and
point
out
how
you
may
avoid
them
beware
my
love
i
conjure
you
of
that
self-delusion
which
has
been
fatal
to
the
peace
of
so
many
persons
beware
of
priding
yourself
on
the
gracefulness
of
sensibility
if
you
yield
to
this
vanity
your
happiness
is
lost
for
ever
always
remember
how
much
more
valuable
is
the
strength
of
fortitude
than
the
grace
of
sensibility
do
not
however
confound
fortitude
with
apathy
apathy
cannot
know
the
virtue
remember
too
that
one
act
of
beneficence
one
act
of
real
usefulness
is
worth
all
the
abstract
sentiment
in
the
world
sentiment
is
a
disgrace
instead
of
an
ornament
unless
it
lead
us
to
good
actions
the
miser
who
thinks
himself
respectable
merely
because
he
possesses
wealth
and
thus
mistakes
the
means
of
doing
good
for
the
actual
accomplishment
of
it
is
not
more
blameable
than
the
man
of
sentiment
without
active
virtue
you
may
have
observed
persons
who
delight
so
much
in
this
sort
of
sensibility
to
sentiment
which
excludes
that
to
the
calls
of
any
practical
virtue
that
they
turn
from
the
distressed
and
because
their
sufferings
are
painful
to
be
contemplated
do
not
endeavour
to
relieve
them
how
despicable
is
that
humanity
which
can
be
contented
to
pity
where
it
might
assuageâ€
st
aubert
some
time
after
spoke
of
madame
cheron
his
sister
â€œlet
me
inform
you
of
a
circumstance
that
nearly
affects
your
welfareâ€
he
added
â€œwe
have
you
know
had
little
intercourse
for
some
years
but
as
she
is
now
your
only
female
relation
i
have
thought
it
proper
to
consign
you
to
her
care
as
you
will
see
in
my
will
till
you
are
of
age
and
to
recommend
you
to
her
protection
afterwards
she
is
not
exactly
the
person
to
whom
i
would
have
committed
my
emily
but
i
had
no
alternative
and
i
believe
her
to
be
upon
the
wholeâ€”a
good
kind
of
woman
i
need
not
recommend
it
to
your
prudence
my
love
to
endeavour
to
conciliate
her
kindness
you
will
do
this
for
his
sake
who
has
often
wished
to
do
so
for
yoursâ€
emily
assured
him
that
whatever
he
requested
she
would
religiously
perform
to
the
utmost
of
her
ability
â€œalasâ€
added
she
in
a
voice
interrupted
by
sighs
â€œthat
will
soon
be
all
which
remains
for
me
it
will
be
almost
my
only
consolation
to
fulfil
your
wishesâ€
st
aubert
looked
up
silently
in
her
face
as
if
would
have
spoken
but
his
spirit
sunk
a
while
and
his
eyes
became
heavy
and
dull
she
felt
that
look
at
her
heart
â€œmy
dear
fatherâ€
she
exclaimed
and
then
checking
herself
pressed
his
hand
closer
and
hid
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
her
tears
were
concealed
but
st
aubert
heard
her
convulsive
sobs
his
spirits
returned
â€œo
my
childâ€
said
he
faintly
â€œlet
my
consolations
be
yours
i
die
in
peace
for
i
know
that
i
am
about
to
return
to
the
bosom
of
my
father
who
will
still
be
your
father
when
i
am
gone
always
trust
in
him
my
love
and
he
will
support
you
in
these
moments
as
he
supports
meâ€
emily
could
only
listen
and
weep
but
the
extreme
composure
of
his
manner
and
the
faith
and
hope
he
expressed
somewhat
soothed
her
anguish
yet
whenever
she
looked
upon
his
emaciated
countenance
and
saw
the
lines
of
death
beginning
to
prevail
over
itâ€”saw
his
sunk
eyes
still
bent
on
her
and
their
heavy
lids
pressing
to
a
close
there
was
a
pang
in
her
heart
such
as
defied
expression
though
it
required
filial
virtue
like
hers
to
forbear
the
attempt
he
desired
once
more
to
bless
her
â€œwhere
are
you
my
dearâ€
said
he
as
he
stretched
forth
his
hands
emily
had
turned
to
the
window
that
he
might
not
perceive
her
anguish
she
now
understood
that
his
sight
had
failed
him
when
he
had
given
her
his
blessing
and
it
seemed
to
be
the
last
effort
of
expiring
life
he
sunk
back
on
his
pillow
she
kissed
his
forehead
the
damps
of
death
had
settled
there
and
forgetting
her
fortitude
for
a
moment
her
tears
mingled
with
them
st
aubert
lifted
up
his
eyes
the
spirit
of
a
father
returned
to
them
but
it
quickly
vanished
and
he
spoke
no
more
st
aubert
lingered
till
about
three
oâ€™clock
in
the
afternoon
and
thus
gradually
sinking
into
death
he
expired
without
a
struggle
or
a
sigh
emily
was
led
from
the
chamber
by
la
voisin
and
his
daughter
who
did
what
they
could
to
comfort
her
the
old
man
sat
and
wept
with
her
agnes
was
more
erroneously
officious
oâ€™er
him
whose
doom
thy
virtues
grieve
aerial
forms
shall
sit
at
eve
and
bend
the
pensive
head
collins
the
monk
who
had
before
appeared
returned
in
the
evening
to
offer
consolation
to
emily
and
brought
a
kind
message
from
the
lady
abbess
inviting
her
to
the
convent
emily
though
she
did
not
accept
the
offer
returned
an
answer
expressive
of
her
gratitude
the
holy
conversation
of
the
friar
whose
mild
benevolence
of
manners
bore
some
resemblance
to
those
of
st
aubert
soothed
the
violence
of
her
grief
and
lifted
her
heart
to
the
being
who
extending
through
all
place
and
all
eternity
looks
on
the
events
of
this
little
world
as
on
the
shadows
of
a
moment
and
beholds
equally
and
in
the
same
instant
the
soul
that
has
passed
the
gates
of
death
and
that
which
still
lingers
in
the
body
â€œin
the
sight
of
godâ€
said
emily
â€œmy
dear
father
now
exists
as
truly
as
he
yesterday
existed
to
me
it
is
to
me
only
that
he
is
dead
to
god
and
to
himself
he
yet
livesâ€
the
good
monk
left
her
more
tranquil
than
she
had
been
since
st
aubert
died
and
before
she
retired
to
her
little
cabin
for
the
night
she
trusted
herself
so
far
as
to
visit
the
corpse
silent
and
without
weeping
she
stood
by
its
side
the
features
placid
and
serene
told
the
nature
of
the
last
sensations
that
had
lingered
in
the
now
deserted
frame
for
a
moment
she
turned
away
in
horror
of
the
stillness
in
which
death
had
fixed
that
countenance
never
till
now
seen
otherwise
than
animated
then
gazed
on
it
with
a
mixture
of
doubt
and
awful
astonishment
her
reason
could
scarcely
overcome
an
involuntary
and
unaccountable
expectation
of
seeing
that
beloved
countenance
still
susceptible
she
continued
to
gaze
wildly
took
up
the
cold
hand
spoke
still
gazed
and
then
burst
into
a
transport
of
grief
la
voisin
hearing
her
sobs
came
into
the
room
to
lead
her
away
but
she
heard
nothing
and
only
begged
that
he
would
leave
her
again
alone
she
indulged
her
tears
and
when
the
gloom
of
evening
obscured
the
chamber
and
almost
veiled
from
her
eyes
the
object
of
her
distress
she
still
hung
over
the
body
till
her
spirits
at
length
were
exhausted
and
she
became
tranquil
la
voisin
again
knocked
at
the
door
and
entreated
that
she
would
come
to
the
common
apartment
before
she
went
she
kissed
the
lips
of
st
aubert
as
she
was
wont
to
do
when
she
bade
him
good
night
again
she
kissed
them
her
heart
felt
as
if
it
would
break
a
few
tears
of
agony
started
to
her
eyes
she
looked
up
to
heaven
then
at
st
aubert
and
left
the
room
retired
to
her
lonely
cabin
her
melancholy
thoughts
still
hovered
round
the
body
of
her
deceased
parent
and
when
she
sunk
into
a
kind
of
slumber
the
images
of
her
waking
mind
still
haunted
her
fancy
she
thought
she
saw
her
father
approaching
her
with
a
benign
countenance
then
smiling
mournfully
and
pointing
upwards
his
lips
moved
but
instead
of
words
she
heard
sweet
music
borne
on
the
distant
air
and
presently
saw
his
features
glow
with
the
mild
rapture
of
a
superior
being
the
strain
seemed
to
swell
louder
and
she
awoke
the
vision
was
gone
but
music
yet
came
to
her
ear
in
strains
such
as
angels
might
breathe
she
doubted
listened
raised
herself
in
the
bed
and
again
listened
it
was
music
and
not
an
illusion
of
her
imagination
after
a
solemn
steady
harmony
it
paused
then
rose
again
in
mournful
sweetness
and
then
died
in
a
cadence
that
seemed
to
bear
away
the
listening
soul
to
heaven
she
instantly
remembered
the
music
of
the
preceding
night
with
the
strange
circumstances
related
by
la
voisin
and
the
affecting
conversation
it
had
led
to
concerning
the
state
of
departed
spirits
all
that
st
aubert
had
said
on
that
subject
now
pressed
upon
her
heart
and
overwhelmed
it
what
a
change
in
a
few
hours
he
who
then
could
only
conjecture
was
now
made
acquainted
with
truth
was
himself
become
one
of
the
departed
as
she
listened
she
was
chilled
with
superstitious
awe
her
tears
stopped
and
she
rose
and
went
to
the
window
all
without
was
obscured
in
shade
but
emily
turning
her
eyes
from
the
massy
darkness
of
the
woods
whose
waving
outline
appeared
on
the
horizon
saw
on
the
left
that
effulgent
planet
which
the
old
man
had
pointed
out
setting
over
the
woods
she
remembered
what
he
had
said
concerning
it
and
the
music
now
coming
at
intervals
on
the
air
she
unclosed
the
casement
to
listen
to
the
strains
that
soon
gradually
sunk
to
a
greater
distance
and
tried
to
discover
whence
they
came
the
obscurity
prevented
her
from
distinguishing
any
object
on
the
green
platform
below
and
the
sounds
became
fainter
and
fainter
till
they
softened
into
silence
she
listened
but
they
returned
no
more
soon
after
she
observed
the
planet
trembling
between
the
fringed
tops
of
the
woods
and
in
the
next
moment
sink
behind
them
chilled
with
a
melancholy
awe
she
retired
once
more
to
her
bed
and
at
length
forgot
for
a
while
her
sorrows
in
sleep
on
the
following
morning
she
was
visited
by
a
sister
of
the
convent
who
came
with
kind
offices
and
a
second
invitation
from
the
lady
abbess
and
emily
though
she
could
not
forsake
the
cottage
while
the
remains
of
her
father
were
in
it
consented
however
painful
such
a
visit
must
be
in
the
present
state
of
her
spirits
to
pay
her
respects
to
the
abbess
in
the
evening
about
an
hour
before
sunset
la
voisin
showed
her
the
way
through
the
woods
to
the
convent
which
stood
in
a
small
bay
of
the
mediterranean
crowned
by
a
woody
amphitheatre
and
emily
had
she
been
less
unhappy
would
have
admired
the
extensive
sea
view
that
appeared
from
the
green
slope
in
front
of
the
edifice
and
the
rich
shores
hung
with
woods
and
pastures
that
extended
on
either
hand
but
her
thoughts
were
now
occupied
by
one
sad
idea
and
the
features
of
nature
were
to
her
colourless
and
without
form
the
bell
for
vespers
struck
as
she
passed
the
ancient
gate
of
the
convent
and
seemed
the
funereal
note
for
st
aubert
little
incidents
affect
a
mind
enervated
by
sorrow
emily
struggled
against
the
sickening
faintness
that
came
over
her
and
was
led
into
the
presence
of
the
abbess
who
received
her
with
an
air
of
maternal
tenderness
an
air
of
such
gentle
solicitude
and
consideration
as
touched
her
with
an
instantaneous
gratitude
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
and
the
words
she
would
have
spoken
faltered
on
her
lips
the
abbess
led
her
to
a
seat
and
sat
down
beside
her
still
holding
her
hand
and
regarding
her
in
silence
as
emily
dried
her
tears
and
attempted
to
speak
â€œbe
composed
my
daughterâ€
said
the
abbess
in
a
soothing
voice
â€œdo
not
speak
yet
i
know
all
you
would
say
your
spirits
must
be
soothed
we
are
going
to
prayersâ€”will
you
attend
our
evening
service
it
is
comfortable
my
child
to
look
up
in
our
afflictions
to
a
father
who
sees
and
pities
us
and
who
chastens
in
his
mercyâ€
emilyâ€™s
tears
flowed
again
but
a
thousand
sweet
emotions
mingled
with
them
the
abbess
suffered
her
to
weep
without
interruption
and
watched
over
her
with
a
look
of
benignity
that
might
have
characterised
the
countenance
of
a
guardian
angel
emily
when
she
became
tranquil
was
encouraged
to
speak
without
reserve
and
to
mention
the
motive
that
made
her
unwilling
to
quit
the
cottage
which
the
abbess
did
not
oppose
even
by
a
hint
but
praised
the
filial
piety
of
her
conduct
and
added
a
hope
that
she
would
pass
a
few
days
at
the
convent
before
she
returned
to
la
vallã©e
â€œyou
must
allow
yourself
a
little
time
to
recover
from
your
first
shock
my
daughter
before
you
encounter
a
second
i
will
not
affect
to
conceal
from
you
how
much
i
know
your
heart
must
suffer
on
returning
to
the
scene
of
your
former
happiness
here
you
will
have
all
that
quiet
and
sympathy
and
religion
can
give
to
restore
your
spirits
but
comeâ€
added
she
observing
the
tears
swell
in
emilyâ€™s
eyes
â€œwe
will
go
to
the
chapelâ€
emily
followed
to
the
parlour
where
the
nuns
were
assembled
to
whom
the
abbess
committed
her
saying
â€œthis
is
a
daughter
for
whom
i
have
much
esteem
be
sisters
to
herâ€
they
passed
on
in
a
train
to
the
chapel
where
the
solemn
devotion
with
which
the
service
was
performed
elevated
her
mind
and
brought
to
it
the
comforts
of
faith
and
resignation
twilight
came
on
before
the
abbessâ€™s
kindness
would
suffer
emily
to
depart
when
she
left
the
convent
with
a
heart
much
lighter
than
she
had
entered
it
and
was
reconducted
by
la
voisin
through
the
woods
the
pensive
gloom
of
which
was
in
unison
with
the
temper
of
her
mind
and
she
pursued
the
little
wild
path
in
musing
silence
till
her
guide
suddenly
stopped
looked
round
and
then
struck
out
of
the
path
into
the
high
grass
saying
he
had
mistaken
the
road
he
now
walked
on
quickly
and
emily
proceeding
with
difficulty
over
the
obscured
and
uneven
ground
was
left
at
some
distance
till
her
voice
arrested
him
who
seemed
unwilling
to
stop
and
still
hurried
on
â€œif
you
are
in
doubt
about
the
wayâ€
said
emily
â€œhad
we
not
better
enquire
it
at
the
chã¢teau
yonder
between
the
treesâ€
â€œnoâ€
replied
la
voisin
â€œthere
is
no
occasion
when
we
reach
that
brook
maâ€™amselle
you
see
the
light
upon
the
water
there
beyond
the
woods
when
we
reach
that
brook
we
shall
be
at
home
presently
i
donâ€™t
know
how
i
happened
to
mistake
the
path
i
seldom
come
this
way
after
sunsetâ€
â€œit
is
solitary
enoughâ€
said
emily
â€œbut
you
have
no
banditti
hereâ€
â€œno
maâ€™amselleâ€”no
bandittiâ€
â€œwhat
are
you
afraid
of
then
my
good
friend
you
are
not
superstitiousâ€
â€œno
not
superstitious
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
lady
nobody
likes
to
go
near
that
chã¢teau
after
duskâ€
â€œby
whom
is
it
inhabitedâ€
said
emily
â€œthat
it
is
so
formidableâ€
â€œwhy
maâ€™amselle
it
is
scarcely
inhabited
for
our
lord
the
marquis
and
the
lord
of
all
these
find
woods
too
is
dead
he
had
not
once
been
in
it
for
these
many
years
and
his
people
who
have
the
care
of
it
live
in
a
cottage
close
byâ€
emily
now
understood
this
to
be
the
chã¢teau
which
la
voisin
had
formerly
pointed
out
as
having
belonged
to
the
marquis
villeroi
on
the
mention
of
which
her
father
had
appeared
so
much
affected
â€œah
it
is
a
desolate
place
nowâ€
continued
la
voisin
â€œand
such
a
grand
fine
place
as
i
remember
itâ€
emily
enquired
what
had
occasioned
this
lamentable
change
but
the
old
man
was
silent
and
emily
whose
interest
was
awakened
by
the
fear
he
had
expressed
and
above
all
by
a
recollection
of
her
fatherâ€™s
agitation
repeated
the
question
and
added
â€œif
you
are
neither
afraid
of
the
inhabitants
my
good
friend
nor
are
superstitious
how
happens
it
that
you
dread
to
pass
near
that
chã¢teau
in
the
darkâ€
â€œperhaps
then
i
am
a
little
superstitious
maâ€™amselle
and
if
you
knew
what
i
do
you
might
be
so
too
strange
things
have
happened
there
monsieur
your
good
father
appeared
to
have
known
the
late
marchionessâ€
â€œpray
inform
me
what
did
happenâ€
said
emily
with
much
emotion
â€œalas
maâ€™amselleâ€
answered
la
voisin
â€œenquire
no
further
it
is
not
for
me
to
lay
open
the
domestic
secrets
of
my
lordâ€â€”emily
surprised
by
the
old
manâ€™s
words
and
his
manner
of
delivering
them
forbore
to
repeat
her
question
a
nearer
interest
the
remembrance
of
st
aubert
occupied
her
thoughts
and
she
was
led
to
recollect
the
music
she
heard
on
the
preceding
night
which
she
mentioned
to
la
voisin
â€œyou
were
not
alone
maâ€™amselle
in
thisâ€
he
replied
â€œi
heard
it
too
but
i
have
so
often
heard
it
at
the
same
hour
that
i
was
scarcely
surprisedâ€
â€œyou
doubtless
believe
this
music
to
have
some
connection
with
the
chã¢teauâ€
said
emily
suddenly
â€œand
are
therefore
superstitiousâ€
â€œit
may
be
so
maâ€™amselle
but
there
are
other
circumstances
belonging
to
that
chã¢teau
which
i
remember
and
sadly
tooâ€
a
heavy
sigh
followed
but
emilyâ€™s
delicacy
restrained
the
curiosity
these
words
revived
and
she
enquired
no
further
on
reaching
the
cottage
all
the
violence
of
her
grief
returned
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
escaped
its
heavy
pressure
only
while
she
was
removed
from
the
object
of
it
she
passed
immediately
to
the
chamber
where
the
remains
of
her
father
were
laid
and
yielded
to
all
the
anguish
of
hopeless
grief
la
voisin
at
length
persuaded
her
to
leave
the
room
and
she
returned
to
her
own
where
exhausted
by
the
sufferings
of
the
day
she
soon
fell
into
deep
sleep
and
awoke
considerably
refreshed
when
the
dreadful
hour
arrived
in
which
the
remains
of
st
aubert
were
to
be
taken
from
her
for
ever
she
went
alone
to
the
chamber
to
look
upon
his
countenance
yet
once
again
and
la
voisin
who
had
waited
patiently
below
stairs
till
her
despair
should
subside
with
the
respect
due
to
grief
forbore
to
interrupt
the
indulgence
of
it
till
surprise
at
the
length
of
her
stay
and
then
apprehension
overcame
his
delicacy
and
he
went
to
lead
her
from
the
chamber
having
tapped
gently
at
the
door
without
receiving
an
answer
he
listened
attentively
but
all
was
still
no
sigh
no
sob
of
anguish
was
heard
yet
more
alarmed
by
this
silence
he
opened
the
door
and
found
emily
lying
senseless
across
the
foot
of
the
bed
near
which
stood
the
coffin
his
calls
procured
assistance
and
she
was
carried
to
her
room
where
proper
applications
at
length
restored
her
during
her
state
of
insensibility
la
voisin
had
given
directions
for
the
coffin
to
be
closed
and
he
succeeded
in
persuading
emily
to
forbear
revisiting
the
chamber
she
indeed
felt
herself
unequal
to
this
and
also
perceived
the
necessity
of
sparing
her
spirits
and
recollecting
fortitude
sufficient
to
bear
her
through
the
approaching
scene
st
aubert
had
given
a
particular
injunction
that
his
remains
should
be
interred
in
the
church
of
the
convent
of
st
clair
and
in
mentioning
the
north
chancel
near
the
ancient
tomb
of
the
villerois
had
pointed
out
the
exact
spot
where
he
wished
to
be
laid
the
superior
had
granted
this
place
for
the
interment
and
thither
therefore
the
sad
procession
now
moved
which
was
met
at
the
gates
by
the
venerable
priest
followed
by
a
train
of
friars
every
person
who
heard
the
solemn
chant
of
the
anthem
and
the
peal
of
the
organ
that
struck
up
when
the
body
entered
the
church
and
saw
also
the
feeble
steps
and
the
assumed
tranquillity
of
emily
gave
her
involuntary
tears
she
shed
none
but
walked
her
face
partly
shaded
by
a
thin
black
veil
between
two
persons
who
supported
her
preceded
by
the
abbess
and
followed
by
nuns
whose
plaintive
voices
mellowed
the
swelling
harmony
of
the
dirge
when
the
procession
came
to
the
grave
the
music
ceased
emily
drew
the
veil
entirely
over
her
face
and
in
a
momentary
pause
between
the
anthem
and
the
rest
of
the
service
her
sobs
were
distinctly
audible
the
holy
father
began
the
service
and
emily
again
commanded
her
feelings
till
the
coffin
was
let
down
and
she
heard
the
earth
rattle
on
its
lid
then
as
she
shuddered
a
groan
burst
from
her
heart
and
she
leaned
for
support
on
the
person
who
stood
next
to
her
in
a
few
moments
she
recovered
and
when
she
heard
those
affecting
and
sublime
words
â€œhis
body
is
buried
in
peace
and
his
soul
returns
to
him
that
gave
itâ€
her
anguish
softened
into
tears
the
abbess
led
her
from
the
church
into
her
own
parlour
and
there
administered
all
the
consolations
that
religion
and
gentle
sympathy
can
give
emily
struggled
against
the
pressure
of
grief
but
the
abbess
observing
her
attentively
ordered
a
bed
to
be
prepared
and
recommended
her
to
retire
to
repose
she
also
kindly
claimed
her
promise
to
remain
a
few
days
at
the
convent
and
emily
who
had
no
wish
to
return
to
the
cottage
the
scene
of
all
her
sufferings
had
leisure
now
that
no
immediate
care
pressed
upon
her
attention
to
feel
the
indisposition
which
disabled
her
from
immediately
travelling
meanwhile
the
maternal
kindness
of
the
abbess
and
the
gentle
attentions
of
the
nuns
did
all
that
was
possible
towards
soothing
her
spirits
and
restoring
her
health
but
the
latter
was
too
deeply
wounded
through
the
medium
of
her
mind
to
be
quickly
revived
she
lingered
for
some
weeks
at
the
convent
under
the
influence
of
a
slow
fever
wishing
to
return
home
yet
unable
to
go
thither
often
even
reluctant
to
leave
the
spot
where
her
fatherâ€™s
relics
were
deposited
and
sometimes
soothing
herself
with
the
consideration
that
if
she
died
here
her
remains
would
repose
beside
those
of
st
aubert
in
the
meanwhile
she
sent
letters
to
madame
cheron
and
to
the
old
housekeeper
informing
them
of
the
sad
event
that
had
taken
place
and
of
her
own
situation
from
her
aunt
she
received
an
answer
abounding
more
in
common-place
condolement
than
in
traits
of
real
sorrow
which
assured
her
that
a
servant
should
be
sent
to
conduct
her
to
la
vallã©e
for
that
her
own
time
was
so
much
occupied
by
company
that
she
had
no
leisure
to
undertake
so
long
a
journey
however
emily
might
prefer
la
vallã©e
to
thoulouse
she
could
not
be
insensible
to
the
indecorous
and
unkind
conduct
of
her
aunt
in
suffering
her
to
return
thither
where
she
had
no
longer
a
relation
to
console
and
protect
her
a
conduct
which
was
the
more
culpable
since
st
aubert
had
appointed
madame
cheron
the
guardian
of
his
orphan
daughter
madame
cheronâ€™s
servant
made
the
attendance
of
the
good
la
voisin
unnecessary
and
emily
who
felt
sensibly
her
obligations
to
him
for
all
his
kind
attention
to
her
late
father
as
well
as
to
herself
was
glad
to
spare
him
a
long
and
what
at
his
time
of
life
must
have
been
a
troublesome
journey
during
her
stay
at
the
convent
the
peace
and
sanctity
that
reigned
within
the
tranquil
beauty
of
the
scenery
without
and
the
delicate
attentions
of
the
abbess
and
the
nuns
were
circumstances
so
soothing
to
her
mind
that
they
almost
tempted
her
to
leave
a
world
where
she
had
lost
her
dearest
friends
and
devote
herself
to
the
cloister
in
a
spot
rendered
sacred
to
her
by
containing
the
tomb
of
st
aubert
the
pensive
enthusiasm
too
so
natural
to
her
temper
had
spread
a
beautiful
illusion
over
the
sanctified
retirement
of
a
nun
that
almost
hid
from
her
view
the
selfishness
of
its
security
but
the
touches
which
a
melancholy
fancy
slightly
tinctured
with
superstition
gave
to
the
monastic
scene
began
to
fade
as
her
spirits
revived
and
brought
once
more
to
her
heart
an
image
which
had
only
transiently
been
banished
thence
by
this
she
was
silently
awakened
to
hope
and
comfort
and
sweet
affections
visions
of
happiness
gleamed
faintly
at
a
distance
and
though
she
knew
them
to
be
illusions
she
could
not
resolve
to
shut
them
out
for
ever
it
was
the
remembrance
of
valancourt
of
his
taste
his
genius
and
of
the
countenance
which
glowed
with
both
that
perhaps
alone
determined
her
to
return
to
the
world
the
grandeur
and
sublimity
of
the
scenes
amidst
which
they
had
first
met
had
fascinated
her
fancy
and
had
imperceptibly
contributed
to
render
valancourt
more
interesting
by
seeming
to
communicate
to
him
somewhat
of
their
own
character
the
esteem
too
which
st
aubert
had
repeatedly
expressed
for
him
sanctioned
this
kindness
but
though
his
countenance
and
manner
had
continually
expressed
his
admiration
of
her
he
had
not
otherwise
declared
it
and
even
the
hope
of
seeing
him
again
was
so
distant
that
she
was
scarcely
conscious
of
it
still
less
that
it
influenced
her
conduct
on
this
occasion
it
was
several
days
after
the
arrival
of
madame
cheronâ€™s
servant
before
emily
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
undertake
the
journey
to
la
vallã©e
on
the
evening
preceding
her
departure
she
went
to
the
cottage
to
take
leave
of
la
voisin
and
his
family
and
to
make
them
a
return
for
their
kindness
the
old
man
she
found
sitting
on
a
bench
at
his
door
between
his
daughter
and
his
son-in-law
who
was
just
returned
from
his
daily
labour
and
who
was
playing
upon
a
pipe
that
in
tone
resembled
an
oboe
a
flask
of
wine
stood
beside
the
old
man
and
before
him
a
small
table
with
fruit
and
bread
round
which
stood
several
of
his
grandsons
fine
rosy
children
who
were
taking
their
supper
as
their
mother
distributed
it
on
the
edge
of
the
little
green
that
spread
before
the
cottage
were
cattle
and
a
few
sheep
reposing
under
the
trees
the
landscape
was
touched
with
the
mellow
light
of
the
evening
sun
whose
long
slanting
beams
played
through
a
vista
of
the
woods
and
lighted
up
the
distant
turrets
of
the
chã¢teau
she
paused
a
moment
before
she
emerged
from
the
shade
to
gaze
upon
the
happy
group
before
herâ€”on
the
complacency
and
ease
of
healthy
age
depictured
on
the
countenance
of
la
voisin
the
maternal
tenderness
of
agnes
as
she
looked
upon
her
children
and
the
innocency
of
infantine
pleasures
reflected
in
their
smiles
emily
looked
again
at
the
venerable
old
man
and
at
the
cottage
the
memory
of
her
father
rose
with
full
force
upon
her
mind
and
she
hastily
stepped
forward
afraid
to
trust
herself
with
a
longer
pause
she
took
an
affectionate
and
affecting
leave
of
la
voisin
and
his
family
he
seemed
to
love
her
as
his
daughter
and
shed
tears
emily
shed
many
she
avoided
going
into
the
cottage
since
she
knew
it
would
revive
emotions
such
as
she
could
not
now
endure
one
painful
scene
yet
awaited
her
for
she
determined
to
visit
again
her
fatherâ€™s
grave
and
that
she
might
not
be
interrupted
or
observed
in
the
indulgence
of
her
melancholy
tenderness
she
deferred
her
visit
till
every
inhabitant
of
the
convent
except
the
nun
who
promised
to
bring
her
the
key
of
the
church
should
be
retired
to
rest
emily
remained
in
her
chamber
till
she
heard
the
convent
bell
strike
twelve
when
the
nun
came
as
she
had
appointed
with
the
key
of
a
private
door
that
opened
into
the
church
and
they
descended
together
the
narrow
winding
staircase
that
led
thither
the
nun
offered
to
accompany
emily
to
the
grave
adding
â€œit
is
melancholy
to
go
alone
at
this
hourâ€
but
the
former
thanking
her
for
the
consideration
could
not
consent
to
have
any
witness
of
her
sorrow
and
the
sister
having
unlocked
the
door
gave
her
the
lamp
â€œyou
will
remember
sisterâ€
said
she
â€œthat
in
the
east
aisle
which
you
must
pass
is
a
newly
opened
grave
hold
the
light
to
the
ground
that
you
may
not
stumble
over
the
loose
earthâ€
emily
thanking
her
again
took
the
lamp
and
stepping
into
the
church
sister
mariette
departed
but
emily
paused
a
moment
at
the
door
a
sudden
fear
came
over
her
and
she
returned
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase
where
as
she
heard
the
steps
of
the
nun
ascending
and
while
she
held
up
the
lamp
saw
her
black
veil
waving
over
the
spiral
balusters
she
was
tempted
to
call
her
back
while
she
hesitated
the
veil
disappeared
and
in
the
next
moment
ashamed
of
her
fears
she
returned
to
the
church
the
cold
air
of
the
aisles
chilled
her
and
their
deep
silence
and
extent
feebly
shone
upon
by
the
moonlight
that
streamed
through
a
distant
gothic
window
would
at
any
other
time
have
awed
her
into
superstition
now
grief
occupied
all
her
attention
she
scarcely
heard
the
whispering
echoes
of
her
own
steps
or
thought
of
the
open
grave
till
she
found
herself
almost
on
its
brink
a
friar
of
the
convent
had
been
buried
there
on
the
preceding
evening
and
as
she
had
sat
alone
in
her
chamber
at
twilight
she
heard
at
distance
the
monks
chanting
the
requiem
for
his
soul
this
brought
freshly
to
her
memory
the
circumstances
of
her
fatherâ€™s
death
and
as
the
voices
mingling
with
a
low
querulous
peal
of
the
organ
swelled
faintly
gloomy
and
affecting
visions
had
arisen
upon
her
mind
now
she
remembered
them
and
turning
aside
to
avoid
the
broken
ground
these
recollections
made
her
pass
on
with
quicker
steps
to
the
grave
of
st
aubert
when
in
the
moonlight
that
fell
athwart
a
remote
part
of
the
aisle
she
thought
she
saw
a
shadow
gliding
between
the
pillars
she
stopped
to
listen
and
not
hearing
any
footstep
believed
that
her
fancy
had
deceived
her
and
no
longer
apprehensive
of
being
observed
proceeded
st
aubert
was
buried
beneath
a
plain
marble
bearing
little
more
than
his
name
and
the
date
of
his
birth
and
death
near
the
foot
of
the
stately
monument
of
the
villerois
emily
remained
at
his
grave
till
a
chime
that
called
the
monks
to
early
prayers
warned
her
to
retire
then
she
wept
over
it
a
last
farewell
and
forced
herself
from
the
spot
after
this
hour
of
melancholy
indulgence
she
was
refreshed
by
a
deeper
sleep
than
she
had
experienced
for
a
long
time
and
on
awakening
her
mind
was
more
tranquil
and
resigned
than
it
had
been
since
st
aubertâ€™s
death
but
when
the
moment
of
her
departure
from
the
convent
arrived
all
her
grief
returned
the
memory
of
the
dead
and
the
kindness
of
the
living
attached
her
to
the
place
and
for
the
sacred
spot
where
her
fatherâ€™s
remains
were
interred
she
seemed
to
feel
all
those
tender
affections
which
we
conceive
for
home
the
abbess
repeated
many
kind
assurances
of
regard
at
their
parting
and
pressed
her
to
return
if
ever
she
should
find
her
condition
elsewhere
unpleasant
many
of
the
nuns
also
expressed
unaffected
regret
at
her
departure
and
emily
left
the
convent
with
many
tears
and
followed
by
sincere
wishes
for
her
happiness
she
had
travelled
several
leagues
before
the
scenes
of
the
country
through
which
she
passed
had
power
to
rouse
her
for
a
moment
from
the
deep
melancholy
into
which
she
was
sunk
and
when
they
did
it
was
only
to
remind
her
that
on
her
last
view
of
them
st
aubert
was
at
her
side
and
to
call
up
to
her
remembrance
the
remarks
he
had
delivered
on
similar
scenery
thus
without
any
particular
occurrence
passed
the
day
in
languor
and
dejection
she
slept
that
night
in
a
town
on
the
skirts
of
languedoc
and
on
the
following
morning
entered
gascony
towards
the
close
of
this
day
emily
came
within
view
of
the
plains
in
the
neighbourhood
of
la
vallã©e
and
the
well-known
objects
of
former
times
began
to
press
upon
her
notice
and
with
them
recollections
that
awakened
all
her
tenderness
and
grief
often
while
she
looked
through
her
tears
upon
the
wild
grandeur
of
the
pyrenees
now
varied
with
the
rich
lights
and
shadows
of
evening
she
remembered
that
when
last
she
saw
them
her
father
partook
with
her
of
the
pleasure
they
inspired
suddenly
some
scene
which
he
had
particularly
pointed
out
to
her
would
present
itself
and
the
sick
languor
of
despair
would
steal
upon
her
heart
â€œthereâ€
she
would
exclaim
â€œthere
are
the
very
cliffs
there
the
wood
of
pines
which
he
looked
at
with
such
delight
as
we
passed
this
road
together
for
the
last
time
there
too
under
the
crag
of
that
mountain
is
the
cottage
peeping
from
among
the
cedars
which
he
bade
me
remember
and
copy
with
my
pencil
o
my
father
shall
i
never
see
you
moreâ€
as
she
drew
near
the
chã¢teau
these
melancholy
memorials
of
past
times
multiplied
at
length
the
chã¢teau
itself
appeared
amid
the
glowing
beauty
of
st
aubertâ€™s
favourite
landscape
this
was
an
object
which
called
for
fortitude
not
for
tears
emily
dried
hers
and
prepared
to
meet
with
calmness
the
trying
moment
of
her
return
to
that
home
where
there
was
no
longer
a
parent
to
welcome
her
â€œyesâ€
said
she
â€œlet
me
not
forget
the
lessons
he
has
taught
me
how
often
he
has
pointed
out
the
necessity
of
resisting
even
virtuous
sorrow
how
often
we
have
admired
together
the
greatness
of
a
mind
that
can
at
once
suffer
and
reason
o
my
father
if
you
are
permitted
to
look
down
upon
your
child
it
will
please
you
to
see
that
she
remembers
and
endeavours
to
practise
the
precepts
you
have
given
herâ€
a
turn
on
the
road
now
allowed
a
nearer
view
of
the
chã¢teau
the
chimneys
tipped
with
light
rising
from
behind
st
aubertâ€™s
favourite
oaks
whose
foliage
partly
concealed
the
lower
part
of
the
building
emily
could
not
suppress
a
heavy
sigh
â€œthis
too
was
his
favourite
hourâ€
said
she
as
she
gazed
upon
the
long
evening
shadows
stretched
athwart
the
landscape
â€œhow
deep
the
repose
how
lovely
the
scene
lovely
and
tranquil
as
in
former
daysâ€
again
she
resisted
the
pressure
of
sorrow
till
her
ear
caught
the
gay
melody
of
the
dance
which
she
had
so
often
listened
to
as
she
walked
with
st
aubert
on
the
margin
of
the
garonne
when
all
her
fortitude
forsook
her
and
she
continued
to
weep
till
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
little
gate
that
opened
upon
what
was
now
her
own
territory
she
raised
her
eyes
on
the
sudden
stopping
of
the
carriage
and
saw
her
fatherâ€™s
old
housekeeper
coming
to
open
the
gate
manchon
also
came
running
and
barking
before
her
and
when
his
young
mistress
alighted
fawned
and
played
round
her
gasping
with
joy
â€œdear
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
theresa
and
paused
and
looked
as
if
she
would
have
offered
something
of
condolement
to
emily
whose
tears
now
prevented
reply
the
dog
still
fawned
and
ran
round
her
and
then
flew
towards
the
carriage
with
a
short
quick
bark
â€œah
maâ€™amselleâ€”my
poor
masterâ€
said
theresa
whose
feelings
were
more
awakened
than
her
delicacy
â€œmanchonâ€™s
gone
to
look
for
himâ€
emily
sobbed
aloud
and
on
looking
towards
the
carriage
which
still
stood
with
the
door
open
saw
the
animal
spring
into
it
and
instantly
leap
out
and
then
with
his
nose
on
the
ground
run
round
the
horses
â€œdonâ€™t
cry
so
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
theresa
â€œit
breaks
my
heart
to
see
youâ€
the
dog
now
came
running
to
emily
then
returned
to
the
carriage
and
then
back
again
to
her
whining
and
discontented
â€œpoor
rogueâ€
said
theresa
â€œthou
hast
lost
thy
master
thou
mayst
well
cry
but
come
my
dear
young
lady
be
comforted
what
shall
i
get
to
refresh
youâ€
emily
gave
her
hand
to
the
old
servant
and
tried
to
restrain
her
grief
while
she
made
some
kind
enquiries
concerning
her
health
but
she
still
lingered
in
the
walk
which
led
to
the
chã¢teau
for
within
was
no
person
to
meet
her
with
the
kiss
of
affection
her
own
heart
no
longer
palpitated
with
impatient
joy
to
meet
again
the
well-known
smile
and
she
dreaded
to
see
objects
which
would
recall
the
full
remembrance
of
her
former
happiness
she
moved
slowly
towards
the
door
paused
went
on
and
paused
again
how
silent
how
forsaken
how
forlorn
did
the
chã¢teau
appear
trembling
to
enter
it
yet
blaming
herself
for
delaying
what
she
could
not
avoid
she
at
length
passed
into
the
hall
crossed
it
with
a
hurried
step
as
if
afraid
to
look
round
and
opened
the
door
of
that
room
which
she
was
wont
to
call
her
own
the
gloom
of
evening
gave
solemnity
to
its
silent
and
deserted
air
the
chairs
the
tables
every
article
of
furniture
so
familiar
to
her
in
happier
times
spoke
eloquently
to
her
heart
she
seated
herself
without
immediately
observing
it
in
a
window
which
opened
upon
the
garden
and
where
st
aubert
had
often
sat
with
her
watching
the
sun
retire
from
the
rich
and
extensive
prospect
that
appeared
beyond
the
groves
having
indulged
her
tears
for
some
time
she
became
more
composed
and
when
theresa
after
seeing
the
baggage
deposited
in
her
ladyâ€™s
room
again
appeared
she
had
so
far
recovered
her
spirits
as
to
be
able
to
converse
with
her
â€œi
have
made
up
the
green
bed
for
you
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
theresa
as
she
set
the
coffee
upon
the
table
â€œi
thought
you
would
like
it
better
than
your
own
now
but
i
little
thought
this
day
month
that
you
would
come
back
alone
a-well-a-day
the
news
almost
broke
my
heart
when
it
did
come
who
would
have
believed
that
my
poor
master
when
he
went
from
home
would
never
return
againâ€
emily
hid
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
and
waved
her
hand
â€œdo
taste
the
coffeeâ€
said
theresa
â€œmy
dear
young
lady
be
comfortedâ€”we
must
all
die
my
dear
master
is
a
saint
aboveâ€
emily
took
the
handkerchief
from
her
face
and
raised
her
eyes
full
of
tears
towards
heaven
soon
after
she
dried
them
and
in
a
calm
but
tremulous
voice
began
to
enquire
concerning
some
of
her
late
fatherâ€™s
pensioners
â€œalas-a-dayâ€
said
theresa
as
she
poured
out
the
coffee
and
handed
it
to
her
mistress
â€œall
that
could
come
have
been
here
every
day
to
enquire
after
you
and
my
masterâ€
she
then
proceeded
to
tell
that
some
were
dead
whom
they
had
left
well
and
others
who
were
ill
had
recovered
â€œand
see
maâ€™amselleâ€
added
theresa
â€œthere
is
old
mary
coming
up
the
garden
now
she
has
looked
every
day
these
three
years
as
if
she
would
die
yet
she
is
alive
still
she
has
seen
the
chaise
at
the
door
and
knows
you
are
come
homeâ€
the
sight
of
this
poor
old
woman
would
have
been
too
much
for
emily
and
she
begged
theresa
would
go
and
tell
her
that
she
was
too
ill
to
see
any
person
that
night
â€œtomorrow
i
shall
be
better
perhaps
but
give
her
this
token
of
my
remembranceâ€
emily
sat
for
some
time
given
up
to
sorrow
not
an
object
on
which
her
eye
glanced
but
awakened
some
remembrance
that
led
immediately
to
the
subject
of
her
grief
her
favourite
plants
which
st
aubert
had
taught
her
to
nurse
the
little
drawings
that
adorned
the
room
which
his
taste
had
instructed
her
to
execute
the
books
that
he
had
selected
for
her
use
and
which
they
had
read
together
her
musical
instruments
whose
sounds
he
loved
so
well
and
which
he
sometimes
awakened
himselfâ€”every
object
gave
new
force
to
sorrow
at
length
she
roused
herself
from
this
melancholy
indulgence
and
summoning
all
her
resolution
stepped
forward
to
go
into
those
forlorn
rooms
which
though
she
dreaded
to
enter
she
knew
would
yet
more
powerfully
affect
her
if
she
delayed
to
visit
them
having
passed
through
the
green-house
her
courage
for
a
moment
forsook
her
when
she
opened
the
door
of
the
library
and
perhaps
the
shade
which
evening
and
the
foliage
of
the
trees
near
the
windows
threw
across
the
room
heightened
the
solemnity
of
her
feelings
on
entering
that
apartment
where
everything
spoke
of
her
father
there
was
an
arm
chair
in
which
he
used
to
sit
she
shrunk
when
she
observed
it
for
she
had
so
often
seen
him
seated
there
and
the
idea
of
him
rose
so
distinctly
to
her
mind
that
she
almost
fancied
she
saw
him
before
her
but
she
checked
the
illusions
of
a
distempered
imagination
though
she
could
not
subdue
a
certain
degree
of
awe
which
now
mingled
with
her
emotions
she
walked
slowly
to
the
chair
and
seated
herself
in
it
there
was
a
reading-desk
before
it
on
which
lay
a
book
open
as
it
had
been
left
by
her
father
it
was
some
moments
before
she
recovered
courage
enough
to
examine
it
and
when
she
looked
at
the
open
page
she
immediately
recollected
that
st
aubert
on
the
evening
before
his
departure
from
the
chã¢teau
had
read
to
her
some
passages
from
this
his
favourite
author
the
circumstance
now
affected
her
extremely
she
looked
at
the
page
wept
and
looked
again
to
her
the
book
appeared
sacred
and
invaluable
and
she
would
not
have
moved
it
or
closed
the
page
which
he
had
left
open
for
the
treasures
of
the
indies
still
she
sat
before
the
desk
and
could
not
resolve
to
quit
it
though
the
increasing
gloom
and
the
profound
silence
of
the
apartment
revived
a
degree
of
painful
awe
her
thoughts
dwelt
on
the
probable
state
of
departed
spirits
and
she
remembered
the
affecting
conversation
which
had
passed
between
st
aubert
and
la
voisin
on
the
night
preceding
his
death
as
she
mused
she
saw
the
door
slowly
open
and
a
rustling
sound
in
a
remote
part
of
the
room
startled
her
through
the
dusk
she
thought
she
perceived
something
move
the
subject
she
had
been
considering
and
the
present
tone
of
her
spirits
which
made
her
imagination
respond
to
every
impression
of
her
senses
gave
her
a
sudden
terror
of
something
supernatural
she
sat
for
a
moment
motionless
and
then
her
dissipated
reason
returning
â€œwhat
should
i
fearâ€
said
she
â€œif
the
spirits
of
those
we
love
ever
return
to
us
it
is
in
kindnessâ€
the
silence
which
again
reigned
made
her
ashamed
of
her
late
fears
and
she
believed
that
her
imagination
had
deluded
her
or
that
she
had
heard
one
of
those
unaccountable
noises
which
sometimes
occur
in
old
houses
the
same
sound
however
returned
and
distinguishing
something
moving
towards
her
and
in
the
next
instant
press
beside
her
into
the
chair
she
shrieked
but
her
fleeting
senses
were
instantly
recalled
on
perceiving
that
it
was
manchon
who
sat
by
her
and
who
now
licked
her
hands
affectionately
perceiving
her
spirits
unequal
to
the
task
she
had
assigned
herself
of
visiting
the
deserted
rooms
of
the
chã¢teau
this
night
when
she
left
the
library
she
walked
into
the
garden
and
down
to
the
terrace
that
overhung
the
river
the
sun
was
now
set
but
under
the
dark
branches
of
the
almond
trees
was
seen
the
saffron
glow
of
the
west
spreading
beyond
the
twilight
of
middle
air
the
bat
flitted
silently
by
and
now
and
then
the
mourning
note
of
the
nightingale
was
heard
the
circumstances
of
the
hour
brought
to
her
recollection
some
lines
which
she
had
once
heard
st
aubert
recite
on
this
very
spot
and
she
had
now
a
melancholy
pleasure
in
repeating
them
sonnet
now
the
bat
circles
on
the
breeze
of
eve
that
creeps
in
shuddâ€™ring
fits
along
the
wave
and
trembles
â€™mid
the
woods
and
through
the
cave
whose
lonely
sighs
the
wanderer
deceive
for
oft
when
melancholy
charms
his
mind
he
thinks
the
spirit
of
the
rock
he
hears
nor
listens
but
with
sweetly-thrilling
fears
to
the
low
mystic
murmurs
of
the
wind
now
the
bat
circles
and
the
twilight-dew
falls
silent
round
and
oâ€™er
the
mountain-cliff
the
gleaming
wave
and
far-discoverâ€™d
skiff
spreads
the
grey
veil
of
soft
harmonious
hue
so
falls
oâ€™er
grief
the
dew
of
pityâ€™s
tear
dimming
her
lonely
visions
of
despair
emily
wandering
on
came
to
st
aubertâ€™s
favourite
plane-tree
where
so
often
at
this
hour
they
had
sat
beneath
the
shade
together
and
with
her
dear
mother
so
often
had
conversed
on
the
subject
of
a
future
state
how
often
too
had
her
father
expressed
the
comfort
he
derived
from
believing
that
they
should
meet
in
another
world
emily
overcome
by
these
recollections
left
the
plane-tree
and
as
she
leaned
pensively
on
the
wall
of
the
terrace
she
observed
a
group
of
peasants
dancing
gaily
on
the
banks
of
the
garonne
which
spread
in
broad
expanse
below
and
reflected
the
evening
light
what
a
contrast
they
formed
to
the
desolate
unhappy
emily
they
were
gay
and
debonnaire
as
they
were
wont
to
be
when
she
too
was
gayâ€”when
st
aubert
used
to
listen
to
their
merry
music
with
a
countenance
beaming
pleasure
and
benevolence
emily
having
looked
for
a
moment
on
this
sprightly
band
turned
away
unable
to
bear
the
remembrances
it
excited
but
where
alas
could
she
turn
and
not
meet
new
objects
to
give
acuteness
to
grief
as
she
walked
slowly
towards
the
house
she
was
met
by
theresa
â€œdear
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
she
â€œi
have
been
seeking
you
up
and
down
this
half
hour
and
was
afraid
some
accident
had
happened
to
you
how
can
you
like
to
wander
about
so
in
this
night
air
do
come
into
the
house
think
what
my
poor
master
would
have
said
if
he
could
see
you
i
am
sure
when
my
dear
lady
died
no
gentleman
could
take
it
more
to
heart
than
he
did
yet
you
know
he
seldom
shed
a
tearâ€
â€œpray
theresa
ceaseâ€
said
emily
wishing
to
interrupt
this
ill-judged
but
well-meaning
harangue
theresaâ€™s
loquacity
however
was
not
to
be
silenced
so
easily
â€œand
when
you
used
to
grieve
soâ€
she
added
â€œhe
often
told
you
how
wrong
it
wasâ€”for
that
my
mistress
was
happy
and
if
she
was
happy
i
am
sure
he
is
so
too
for
the
prayers
of
the
poor
they
say
reach
heavenâ€
during
this
speech
emily
had
walked
silently
into
the
chã¢teau
and
theresa
lighted
her
across
the
hall
into
the
common
sitting
parlour
where
she
had
laid
the
cloth
with
one
solitary
knife
and
fork
for
supper
emily
was
in
the
room
before
she
perceived
that
it
was
not
her
own
apartment
but
she
checked
the
emotion
which
inclined
her
to
leave
it
and
seated
herself
quietly
by
the
little
supper
table
her
fatherâ€™s
hat
hung
upon
the
opposite
wall
while
she
gazed
at
it
a
faintness
came
over
her
theresa
looked
at
her
and
then
at
the
object
on
which
her
eyes
were
settled
and
went
to
remove
it
but
emily
waved
her
handâ€”â€œnoâ€
said
she
â€œlet
it
remain
i
am
going
to
my
chamberâ€
â€œnay
maâ€™amselle
supper
is
readyâ€
â€œi
cannot
take
itâ€
replied
emily
â€œi
will
go
to
my
room
and
try
to
sleep
tomorrow
i
shall
be
betterâ€
â€œthis
is
poor
doingsâ€
said
theresa
â€œdear
lady
do
take
some
food
i
have
dressed
a
pheasant
and
a
fine
one
it
is
old
monsieur
barreaux
sent
it
this
morning
for
i
saw
him
yesterday
and
told
him
you
were
coming
and
i
know
nobody
that
seemed
more
concerned
when
he
heard
the
sad
news
then
heâ€
â€œdid
heâ€
said
emily
in
a
tender
voice
while
she
felt
her
poor
heart
warmed
for
a
moment
by
a
ray
of
sympathy
at
length
her
spirits
were
entirely
overcome
and
she
retired
to
her
room
can
musicâ€™s
voice
can
beautyâ€™s
eye
can
paintingâ€™s
glowing
hand
supply
a
charm
so
suited
to
my
mind
as
blows
this
hollow
gust
of
wind
as
drops
this
little
weeping
rill
soft
tinkling
down
the
moss-grown
hill
while
through
the
west
where
sinks
the
crimson
day
meek
twilight
slowly
sails
and
waves
her
banners
grey
mason
emily
some
time
after
her
return
to
la
vallã©e
received
letters
from
her
aunt
madame
cheron
in
which
after
some
common-place
condolement
and
advice
she
invited
her
to
thoulouse
and
added
that
as
her
late
brother
had
entrusted
emilyâ€™s
education
to
her
she
should
consider
herself
bound
to
overlook
her
conduct
emily
at
this
time
wished
only
to
remain
at
la
vallã©e
in
the
scenes
of
her
early
happiness
now
rendered
infinitely
dear
to
her
as
the
late
residence
of
those
whom
she
had
lost
for
ever
where
she
could
weep
unobserved
retrace
their
steps
and
remember
each
minute
particular
of
their
manners
but
she
was
equally
anxious
to
avoid
the
displeasure
of
madame
cheron
though
her
affection
would
not
suffer
her
to
question
even
a
moment
the
propriety
of
st
aubertâ€™s
conduct
in
appointing
madame
cheron
for
her
guardian
she
was
sensible
that
this
step
had
made
her
happiness
depend
in
a
great
degree
on
the
humour
of
her
aunt
in
her
reply
she
begged
permission
to
remain
at
present
at
la
vallã©e
mentioning
the
extreme
dejection
of
her
spirits
and
the
necessity
she
felt
for
quiet
and
retirement
to
restore
them
these
she
knew
were
not
to
be
found
at
madame
cheronâ€™s
whose
inclinations
led
her
into
a
life
of
dissipation
which
her
ample
fortune
encouraged
and
having
given
her
answer
she
felt
somewhat
more
at
ease
in
the
first
days
of
her
affliction
she
was
visited
by
monsieur
barreaux
a
sincere
mourner
for
st
aubert
â€œi
may
well
lament
my
friendâ€
said
he
â€œfor
i
shall
never
meet
with
his
resemblance
if
i
could
have
found
such
a
man
in
what
is
called
society
i
should
not
have
left
itâ€
m
barreauxâ€™s
admiration
of
her
father
endeared
him
extremely
to
emily
whose
heart
found
almost
its
first
relief
in
conversing
of
her
parents
with
a
man
whom
she
so
much
revered
and
who
though
with
such
an
ungracious
appearance
possessed
to
much
goodness
of
heart
and
delicacy
of
mind
several
weeks
passed
away
in
quiet
retirement
and
emilyâ€™s
affliction
began
to
soften
into
melancholy
she
could
bear
to
read
the
books
she
had
before
read
with
her
father
to
sit
in
his
chair
in
the
libraryâ€”to
watch
the
flowers
his
hand
had
plantedâ€”to
awaken
the
tones
of
that
instrument
his
fingers
had
pressed
and
sometimes
even
to
play
his
favourite
air
when
her
mind
had
recovered
from
the
first
shock
of
affliction
perceiving
the
danger
of
yielding
to
indolence
and
that
activity
alone
could
restore
its
tone
she
scrupulously
endeavoured
to
pass
all
her
hours
in
employment
and
it
was
now
that
she
understood
the
full
value
of
the
education
she
had
received
from
st
aubert
for
in
cultivating
her
understanding
he
had
secured
her
an
asylum
from
indolence
without
recourse
to
dissipation
and
rich
and
varied
amusement
and
information
independent
of
the
society
from
which
her
situation
secluded
her
nor
were
the
good
effects
of
this
education
confined
to
selfish
advantages
since
st
aubert
having
nourished
every
amiable
quality
of
her
heart
it
now
expanded
in
benevolence
to
all
around
her
and
taught
her
when
she
could
not
remove
the
misfortunes
of
others
at
least
to
soften
them
by
sympathy
and
tendernessâ€”a
benevolence
that
taught
her
to
feel
for
all
that
could
suffer
madame
cheron
returned
no
answer
to
emilyâ€™s
letter
who
began
to
hope
that
she
should
be
permitted
to
remain
some
time
longer
in
her
retirement
and
her
mind
had
now
so
far
recovered
its
strength
that
she
ventured
to
view
the
scenes
which
most
powerfully
recalled
the
images
of
past
times
among
these
was
the
fishing-house
and
to
indulge
still
more
the
affectionate
melancholy
of
the
visit
she
took
thither
her
lute
that
she
might
again
hear
there
the
tones
to
which
st
aubert
and
her
mother
had
so
often
delighted
to
listen
she
went
alone
and
at
that
still
hour
of
the
evening
which
is
so
soothing
to
fancy
and
to
grief
the
last
time
she
had
been
here
she
was
in
company
with
monsieur
and
madame
st
aubert
a
few
days
preceding
that
on
which
the
latter
was
seized
with
a
fatal
illness
now
when
emily
again
entered
the
woods
that
surrounded
the
building
they
awakened
so
forcibly
the
memory
of
former
times
that
her
resolution
yielded
for
a
moment
to
excess
of
grief
she
stopped
leaned
for
support
against
a
tree
and
wept
for
some
minutes
before
she
had
recovered
herself
sufficiently
to
proceed
the
little
path
that
led
to
the
building
was
overgrown
with
grass
and
the
flowers
which
st
aubert
had
scattered
carelessly
along
the
border
were
almost
choked
with
weedsâ€”the
tall
thistleâ€”the
fox-glove
and
the
nettle
she
often
paused
to
look
on
the
desolate
spot
now
so
silent
and
forsaken
and
when
with
a
trembling
hand
she
opened
the
door
of
the
fishing-house
â€œahâ€
said
she
â€œeverythingâ€”everything
remains
as
when
i
left
it
lastâ€”left
it
with
those
who
never
must
returnâ€
she
went
to
a
window
that
overhung
the
rivulet
and
leaning
over
it
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
current
was
soon
lost
in
melancholy
reverie
the
lute
she
had
brought
lay
forgotten
beside
her
the
mournful
sighing
of
the
breeze
as
it
waved
the
high
pines
above
and
its
softer
whispers
among
the
osiers
that
bowed
upon
the
banks
below
was
a
kind
of
music
more
in
unison
with
her
feelings
it
did
not
vibrate
on
the
chords
of
unhappy
memory
but
was
soothing
to
the
heart
as
the
voice
of
pity
she
continued
to
muse
unconscious
of
the
gloom
of
evening
and
that
the
sunâ€™s
last
light
trembled
on
the
heights
above
and
would
probably
have
remained
so
much
longer
if
a
sudden
footstep
without
the
building
had
not
alarmed
her
attention
and
first
made
her
recollect
that
she
was
unprotected
in
the
next
moment
a
door
opened
and
a
stranger
appeared
who
stopped
on
perceiving
emily
and
then
began
to
apologise
for
his
intrusion
but
emily
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
lost
her
fear
in
a
stronger
emotion
its
tones
were
familiar
to
her
ear
and
though
she
could
not
readily
distinguish
through
the
dusk
the
features
of
the
person
who
spoke
she
felt
a
remembrance
too
strong
to
be
distrusted
he
repeated
his
apology
and
emily
then
said
something
in
reply
when
the
stranger
eagerly
advancing
exclaimed
â€œgood
god
can
it
beâ€”surely
i
am
not
mistakenâ€”maâ€™amselle
st
aubertâ€”is
it
notâ€
â€œit
is
indeedâ€
said
emily
who
was
confirmed
in
her
first
conjecture
for
she
now
distinguished
the
countenance
of
valancourt
lighted
up
with
still
more
than
its
usual
animation
a
thousand
painful
recollections
crowded
to
her
mind
and
the
effort
which
she
made
to
support
herself
only
served
to
increase
her
agitation
valancourt
meanwhile
having
enquired
anxiously
after
her
health
and
expressed
his
hopes
that
m
st
aubert
had
found
benefit
from
travelling
learned
from
the
flood
of
tears
which
she
could
no
longer
repress
the
fatal
truth
he
led
her
to
a
seat
and
sat
down
by
her
while
emily
continued
to
weep
and
valancourt
to
hold
the
hand
which
she
was
unconscious
he
had
taken
till
it
was
wet
with
the
tears
which
grief
for
st
aubert
and
sympathy
for
herself
had
called
forth
â€œi
feelâ€
said
he
at
length
â€œi
feel
how
insufficient
all
attempt
at
consolation
must
be
on
this
subject
i
can
only
mourn
with
you
for
i
cannot
doubt
the
source
of
your
tears
would
to
god
i
were
mistakenâ€
emily
could
still
answer
only
by
tears
till
she
rose
and
begged
they
might
leave
the
melancholy
spot
when
valancourt
though
he
saw
her
feebleness
could
not
offer
to
detain
her
but
took
her
arm
within
his
and
led
her
from
the
fishing-house
they
walked
silently
through
the
woods
valancourt
anxious
to
know
yet
fearing
to
ask
any
particulars
concerning
st
aubert
and
emily
too
much
distressed
to
converse
after
some
time
however
she
acquired
fortitude
enough
to
speak
of
her
father
and
to
give
a
brief
account
of
the
manner
of
his
death
during
which
recital
valancourtâ€™s
countenance
betrayed
strong
emotion
and
when
he
heard
that
st
aubert
had
died
on
the
road
and
that
emily
had
been
left
among
strangers
he
pressed
her
hand
between
his
and
involuntarily
exclaimed
â€œwhy
was
i
not
thereâ€
but
in
the
next
moment
recollected
himself
for
he
immediately
returned
to
the
mention
of
her
father
till
perceiving
that
her
spirits
were
exhausted
he
gradually
changed
the
subject
and
spoke
of
himself
emily
thus
learned
that
after
they
had
parted
he
had
wandered
for
some
time
along
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
and
had
then
returned
through
languedoc
into
gascony
which
was
his
native
province
and
where
he
usually
resided
when
he
had
concluded
his
little
narrative
he
sunk
into
a
silence
which
emily
was
not
disposed
to
interrupt
and
it
continued
till
they
reached
the
gate
of
the
chã¢teau
when
he
stopped
as
if
he
had
known
this
to
be
the
limit
of
his
walk
here
saying
that
it
was
his
intention
to
return
to
estuviã¨re
on
the
following
day
he
asked
her
if
she
would
permit
him
to
take
leave
of
her
in
the
morning
and
emily
perceiving
that
she
could
not
reject
an
ordinary
civility
without
expressing
by
her
refusal
an
expectation
of
something
more
was
compelled
to
answer
that
she
should
be
at
home
she
passed
a
melancholy
evening
during
which
the
retrospect
of
all
that
had
happened
since
she
had
seen
valancourt
would
rise
to
her
imagination
and
the
scene
of
her
fatherâ€™s
death
appeared
in
tints
as
fresh
as
if
it
had
passed
on
the
preceding
day
she
remembered
particularly
the
earnest
and
solemn
manner
in
which
he
had
required
her
to
destroy
the
manuscript
papers
and
awakening
from
the
lethargy
in
which
sorrow
had
held
her
she
was
shocked
to
think
she
had
not
yet
obeyed
him
and
determined
that
another
day
should
not
reproach
her
with
the
neglect
can
such
things
be
and
overcome
us
like
a
summerâ€™s
cloud
without
our
special
wonder
macbeth
on
the
next
morning
emily
ordered
a
fire
to
be
lighted
in
the
stove
of
the
chamber
where
st
aubert
used
to
sleep
and
as
soon
as
she
had
breakfasted
went
thither
to
burn
the
papers
having
fastened
the
door
to
prevent
interruption
she
opened
the
closet
where
they
were
concealed
as
she
entered
which
she
felt
an
emotion
of
unusual
awe
and
stood
for
some
moments
surveying
it
trembling
and
almost
afraid
to
remove
the
board
there
was
a
great
chair
in
one
corner
of
the
closet
and
opposite
to
it
stood
the
table
at
which
she
had
seen
her
father
sit
on
the
evening
that
preceded
his
departure
looking
over
with
so
much
emotion
what
she
believed
to
be
these
very
papers
the
solitary
life
which
emily
had
led
of
late
and
the
melancholy
subjects
on
which
she
had
suffered
her
thoughts
to
dwell
had
rendered
her
at
times
sensible
to
the
â€˜thick-coming
fanciesâ€™
of
a
mind
greatly
enervated
it
was
lamentable
that
her
excellent
understanding
should
have
yielded
even
for
a
moment
to
the
reveries
of
superstition
or
rather
to
those
starts
of
imagination
which
deceive
the
senses
into
what
can
be
called
nothing
less
than
momentary
madness
instances
of
this
temporary
failure
of
mind
had
more
than
once
occurred
since
her
return
home
particularly
when
wandering
through
this
lonely
mansion
in
the
evening
twilight
she
had
been
alarmed
by
appearances
which
would
have
been
unseen
in
her
more
cheerful
days
to
this
infirm
state
of
her
nerves
may
be
attributed
what
she
imagined
when
her
eyes
glancing
a
second
time
on
the
arm-chair
which
stood
in
an
obscure
part
of
the
closet
the
countenance
of
her
dead
father
appeared
there
emily
stood
fixed
for
a
moment
to
the
floor
after
which
she
left
the
closet
her
spirits
however
soon
returned
she
reproached
herself
with
the
weakness
of
thus
suffering
interruption
in
an
act
of
serious
importance
and
again
opened
the
door
by
the
directions
which
st
aubert
had
given
her
she
readily
found
the
board
he
had
described
in
an
opposite
corner
of
the
closet
near
the
window
she
distinguished
also
the
line
he
had
mentioned
and
pressing
it
as
he
had
bade
her
it
slid
down
and
disclosed
the
bundle
of
papers
together
with
some
scattered
ones
and
the
purse
of
louis
with
a
trembling
hand
she
removed
them
replaced
the
board
paused
a
moment
and
was
rising
from
the
floor
when
on
looking
up
there
appeared
to
her
alarmed
fancy
the
same
countenance
in
the
chair
the
illusion
another
instance
of
the
unhappy
effect
which
solitude
and
grief
had
gradually
produced
upon
her
mind
subdued
her
spirits
she
rushed
forward
into
the
chamber
and
sunk
almost
senseless
into
a
chair
returning
reason
soon
overcame
the
dreadful
but
pitiable
attack
of
imagination
and
she
turned
to
the
papers
though
still
with
so
little
recollection
that
her
eyes
involuntarily
settled
on
the
writing
of
some
loose
sheets
which
lay
open
and
she
was
unconscious
that
she
was
transgressing
her
fatherâ€™s
strict
injunction
till
a
sentence
of
dreadful
import
awakened
her
attention
and
her
memory
together
she
hastily
put
the
papers
from
her
but
the
words
which
had
roused
equally
her
curiosity
and
terror
she
could
not
dismiss
from
her
thoughts
so
powerfully
had
they
affected
her
that
she
even
could
not
resolve
to
destroy
the
papers
immediately
and
the
more
she
dwelt
on
the
circumstance
the
more
it
inflamed
her
imagination
urged
by
the
most
forcible
and
apparently
the
most
necessary
curiosity
to
enquire
farther
concerning
the
terrible
and
mysterious
subject
to
which
she
had
seen
an
allusion
she
began
to
lament
her
promise
to
destroy
the
papers
for
a
moment
she
even
doubted
whether
it
could
justly
be
obeyed
in
contradiction
to
such
reasons
as
there
appeared
to
be
for
further
information
but
the
delusion
was
momentary
â€œi
have
given
a
solemn
promiseâ€
said
she
â€œto
observe
a
solemn
injunction
and
it
is
not
my
business
to
argue
but
to
obey
let
me
hasten
to
remove
the
temptation
that
would
destroy
my
innocence
and
embitter
my
life
with
the
consciousness
of
irremediable
guilt
while
i
have
strength
to
reject
itâ€
thus
reanimated
with
a
sense
of
her
duty
she
completed
the
triumph
of
her
integrity
over
temptation
more
forcible
than
any
she
had
ever
known
and
consigned
the
papers
to
the
flames
her
eyes
watched
them
as
they
slowly
consumed
she
shuddered
at
the
recollection
of
the
sentence
she
had
just
seen
and
at
the
certainty
that
the
only
opportunity
of
explaining
it
was
then
passing
away
for
ever
it
was
long
after
this
that
she
recollected
the
purse
and
as
she
was
depositing
it
unopened
in
a
cabinet
perceiving
that
it
contained
something
of
a
size
larger
than
coin
she
examined
it
â€œhis
hand
deposited
them
hereâ€
said
she
as
she
kissed
some
pieces
of
the
coin
and
wetted
them
with
her
tears
â€œhis
handâ€”which
is
now
dustâ€
at
the
bottom
of
the
purse
was
a
small
packet
having
taken
out
which
and
unfolded
paper
after
paper
she
found
to
be
an
ivory
case
containing
the
miniature
of
aâ€”lady
she
startedâ€”â€œthe
sameâ€
said
she
â€œmy
father
wept
overâ€
on
examining
the
countenance
she
could
recollect
no
person
that
it
resembled
it
was
of
uncommon
beauty
and
was
characterised
by
an
expression
of
sweetness
shaded
with
sorrow
and
tempered
by
resignation
st
aubert
had
given
no
directions
concerning
this
picture
nor
had
even
named
it
she
therefore
thought
herself
justified
in
preserving
it
more
than
once
remembering
his
manner
when
he
had
spoken
of
the
marchioness
of
villeroi
she
felt
inclined
to
believe
that
this
was
her
resemblance
yet
there
appeared
no
reason
why
he
should
have
preserved
a
picture
of
that
lady
or
having
preserved
it
why
he
should
lament
over
it
in
a
manner
so
striking
and
affecting
as
she
had
witnessed
on
the
night
preceding
his
departure
emily
still
gazed
on
the
countenance
examining
its
features
but
she
knew
not
where
to
detect
the
charm
that
captivated
her
attention
and
inspired
sentiments
of
such
love
and
pity
dark
brown
hair
played
carelessly
along
the
open
forehead
the
nose
was
rather
inclined
to
aquiline
the
lips
spoke
in
a
smile
but
it
was
a
melancholy
one
the
eyes
were
blue
and
were
directed
upwards
with
an
expression
of
peculiar
meekness
while
the
soft
cloud
of
the
brow
spoke
of
the
fine
sensibility
of
the
temper
emily
was
roused
from
the
musing
mood
into
which
the
picture
had
thrown
her
by
the
closing
of
the
garden
gate
and
on
turning
her
eyes
to
the
window
she
saw
valancourt
coming
towards
the
chã¢teau
her
spirits
agitated
by
the
subjects
that
had
lately
occupied
her
mind
she
felt
unprepared
to
see
him
and
remained
a
few
moments
in
the
chamber
to
recover
herself
when
she
met
him
in
the
parlour
she
was
struck
with
the
change
that
appeared
in
his
air
and
countenance
since
they
had
parted
in
rousillon
which
twilight
and
the
distress
she
suffered
on
the
preceding
evening
had
prevented
her
from
observing
but
dejection
and
languor
disappeared
for
a
moment
in
the
smile
that
now
enlightened
his
countenance
on
perceiving
her
â€œyou
seeâ€
said
he
â€œi
have
availed
myself
of
the
permission
with
which
you
honoured
meâ€”of
bidding
you
farewell
whom
i
had
the
happiness
of
meeting
only
yesterdayâ€
emily
smiled
faintly
and
anxious
to
say
something
asked
if
he
had
been
long
in
gascony
â€œa
few
days
onlyâ€
replied
valancourt
while
a
blush
passed
over
his
cheek
â€œi
engaged
in
a
long
ramble
after
i
had
the
misfortune
of
parting
with
the
friends
who
had
made
my
wanderings
among
the
pyrenees
so
delightfulâ€
a
tear
came
to
emilyâ€™s
eye
as
valancourt
said
this
which
he
observed
and
anxious
to
draw
off
her
attention
from
the
remembrance
that
had
occasioned
it
as
well
as
shocked
at
his
own
thoughtlessness
he
began
to
speak
on
other
subjects
expressing
his
admiration
of
the
chã¢teau
and
its
prospects
emily
who
felt
somewhat
embarrassed
how
to
support
a
conversation
was
glad
of
such
an
opportunity
to
continue
it
on
indifferent
topics
they
walked
down
to
the
terrace
where
valancourt
was
charmed
with
the
river
scenery
and
the
views
over
the
opposite
shores
of
guienne
as
he
leaned
on
the
wall
of
the
terrace
watching
the
rapid
current
of
the
garonne
â€œi
was
a
few
weeks
agoâ€
said
he
â€œat
the
source
of
this
noble
river
i
had
not
then
the
happiness
of
knowing
you
or
i
should
have
regretted
your
absenceâ€”it
was
a
scene
so
exactly
suited
to
your
taste
it
rises
in
a
part
of
the
pyrenees
still
wilder
and
more
sublime
i
think
than
any
we
passed
in
the
way
to
rousillonâ€
he
then
described
its
fall
among
the
precipices
of
the
mountains
where
its
waters
augmented
by
the
streams
that
descend
from
the
snowy
summits
around
rush
into
the
vallã©e
dâ€™aran
between
whose
romantic
heights
it
foams
along
pursuing
its
way
to
the
north
west
till
it
emerges
upon
the
plains
of
languedoc
then
washing
the
walls
of
thoulouse
and
turning
again
to
the
north
west
it
assumes
a
milder
character
as
it
fertilizes
the
pastures
of
gascony
and
guienne
in
its
progress
to
the
bay
of
biscay
emily
and
valancourt
talked
of
the
scenes
they
had
passed
among
the
pyrenean
alps
as
he
spoke
of
which
there
was
often
a
tremulous
tenderness
in
his
voice
and
sometimes
he
expatiated
on
them
with
all
the
fire
of
genius
sometimes
would
appear
scarcely
conscious
of
the
topic
though
he
continued
to
speak
this
subject
recalled
forcibly
to
emily
the
idea
of
her
father
whose
image
appeared
in
every
landscape
which
valancourt
particularized
whose
remarks
dwelt
upon
her
memory
and
whose
enthusiasm
still
glowed
in
her
heart
her
silence
at
length
reminded
valancourt
how
nearly
his
conversation
approached
to
the
occasion
of
her
grief
and
he
changed
the
subject
though
for
one
scarcely
less
affecting
to
emily
when
he
admired
the
grandeur
of
the
plane-tree
that
spread
its
wide
branches
over
the
terrace
and
under
whose
shade
they
now
sat
she
remembered
how
often
she
had
sat
thus
with
st
aubert
and
heard
him
express
the
same
admiration
â€œthis
was
a
favourite
tree
with
my
dear
fatherâ€
said
she
â€œhe
used
to
love
to
sit
under
its
foliage
with
his
family
about
him
in
the
fine
evenings
of
summerâ€
valancourt
understood
her
feelings
and
was
silent
had
she
raised
her
eyes
from
the
ground
she
would
have
seen
tears
in
his
he
rose
and
leaned
on
the
wall
of
the
terrace
from
which
in
a
few
moments
he
returned
to
his
seat
then
rose
again
and
appeared
to
be
greatly
agitated
while
emily
found
her
spirits
so
much
depressed
that
several
of
her
attempts
to
renew
the
conversation
were
ineffectual
valancourt
again
sat
down
but
was
still
silent
and
trembled
at
length
he
said
with
a
hesitating
voice
â€œthis
lovely
sceneâ€”i
am
going
to
leaveâ€”to
leave
youâ€”perhaps
for
ever
these
moments
may
never
return
i
cannot
resolve
to
neglect
though
i
scarcely
dare
to
avail
myself
of
them
let
me
however
without
offending
the
delicacy
of
your
sorrow
venture
to
declare
the
admiration
i
must
always
feel
of
your
goodnessâ€”o
that
at
some
future
period
i
might
be
permitted
to
call
it
loveâ€
emilyâ€™s
emotion
would
not
suffer
her
to
reply
and
valancourt
who
now
ventured
to
look
up
observing
her
countenance
change
expected
to
see
her
faint
and
made
an
involuntary
effort
to
support
her
which
recalled
emily
to
a
sense
of
her
situation
and
to
an
exertion
of
her
spirits
valancourt
did
not
appear
to
notice
her
indisposition
but
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
told
the
tenderest
love
â€œi
will
not
presumeâ€
he
added
â€œto
intrude
this
subject
longer
upon
your
attention
at
this
time
but
i
may
perhaps
be
permitted
to
mention
that
these
parting
moments
would
lose
much
of
their
bitterness
if
i
might
be
allowed
to
hope
the
declaration
i
have
made
would
not
exclude
me
from
your
presence
in
futureâ€
emily
made
another
effort
to
overcome
the
confusion
of
her
thoughts
and
to
speak
she
feared
to
trust
the
preference
her
heart
acknowledged
towards
valancourt
and
to
give
him
any
encouragement
for
hope
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
for
though
in
this
narrow
period
she
had
observed
much
that
was
admirable
in
his
taste
and
disposition
and
though
these
observations
had
been
sanctioned
by
the
opinion
of
her
father
they
were
not
sufficient
testimonies
of
his
general
worth
to
determine
her
upon
a
subject
so
infinitely
important
to
her
future
happiness
as
that
which
now
solicited
her
attention
yet
though
the
thought
of
dismissing
valancourt
was
so
very
painful
to
her
that
she
could
scarcely
endure
to
pause
upon
it
the
consciousness
of
this
made
her
fear
the
partiality
of
her
judgment
and
hesitate
still
more
to
encourage
that
suit
for
which
her
own
heart
too
tenderly
pleaded
the
family
of
valancourt
if
not
his
circumstances
had
been
known
to
her
father
and
known
to
be
unexceptionable
of
his
circumstances
valancourt
himself
hinted
as
far
as
delicacy
would
permit
when
he
said
he
had
at
present
little
else
to
offer
but
a
heart
that
adored
her
he
had
solicited
only
for
a
distant
hope
and
she
could
not
resolve
to
forbid
though
she
scarcely
dared
to
permit
it
at
length
she
acquired
courage
to
say
that
she
must
think
herself
honoured
by
the
good
opinion
of
any
person
whom
her
father
had
esteemed
â€œand
was
i
then
thought
worthy
of
his
esteemâ€
said
valancourt
in
a
voice
trembling
with
anxiety
then
checking
himself
he
added
â€œbut
pardon
the
question
i
scarcely
know
what
i
say
if
i
might
dare
to
hope
that
you
think
me
not
unworthy
such
honour
and
might
be
permitted
sometimes
to
enquire
after
your
health
i
should
now
leave
you
with
comparative
tranquillityâ€
emily
after
a
momentâ€™s
silence
said
â€œi
will
be
ingenuous
with
you
for
i
know
you
will
understand
and
allow
for
my
situation
you
will
consider
it
as
a
proof
of
myâ€”my
esteem
that
i
am
so
though
i
live
here
in
what
was
my
fatherâ€™s
house
i
live
here
alone
i
have
alas
no
longer
a
parentâ€”a
parent
whose
presence
might
sanction
your
visits
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
point
out
the
impropriety
of
my
receiving
themâ€
â€œnor
will
i
affect
to
be
insensible
of
thisâ€
replied
valancourt
adding
mournfullyâ€”â€œbut
what
is
to
console
me
for
my
candour
i
distress
you
and
would
now
leave
the
subject
if
i
might
carry
with
me
a
hope
of
being
some
time
permitted
to
renew
it
of
being
allowed
to
make
myself
known
to
your
familyâ€
emily
was
again
confused
and
again
hesitated
what
to
reply
she
felt
most
acutely
the
difficultyâ€”the
forlornness
of
her
situation
which
did
not
allow
her
a
single
relative
or
friend
to
whom
she
could
turn
for
even
a
look
that
might
support
and
guide
her
in
the
present
embarrassing
circumstances
madame
cheron
who
was
her
only
relative
and
ought
to
have
been
this
friend
was
either
occupied
by
her
own
amusements
or
so
resentful
of
the
reluctance
her
niece
had
shown
to
quit
la
vallã©e
that
she
seemed
totally
to
have
abandoned
her
â€œah
i
seeâ€
said
valancourt
after
a
long
pause
during
which
emily
had
begun
and
left
unfinished
two
or
three
sentences
â€œi
see
that
i
have
nothing
to
hope
my
fears
were
too
just
you
think
me
unworthy
of
your
esteem
that
fatal
journey
which
i
considered
as
the
happiest
period
of
my
lifeâ€”those
delightful
days
were
to
embitter
all
my
future
ones
how
often
i
have
looked
back
to
them
with
hope
and
fearâ€”yet
never
till
this
moment
could
i
prevail
with
myself
to
regret
their
enchanting
influenceâ€
his
voice
faltered
and
he
abruptly
quitted
his
seat
and
walked
on
the
terrace
there
was
an
expression
of
despair
on
his
countenance
that
affected
emily
the
pleadings
of
her
heart
overcame
in
some
degree
her
extreme
timidity
and
when
he
resumed
his
seat
she
said
in
an
accent
that
betrayed
her
tenderness
â€œyou
do
both
yourself
and
me
injustice
when
you
say
i
think
you
unworthy
of
my
esteem
i
will
acknowledge
that
you
have
long
possessed
it
andâ€”andâ€”â€
valancourt
waited
impatiently
for
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence
but
the
words
died
on
her
lips
her
eyes
however
reflected
all
the
emotions
of
her
heart
valancourt
passed
in
an
instant
from
the
impatience
of
despair
to
that
of
joy
and
tenderness
â€œo
emilyâ€
he
exclaimed
â€œmy
own
emilyâ€”teach
me
to
sustain
this
moment
let
me
seal
it
as
the
most
sacred
of
my
lifeâ€
he
pressed
her
hand
to
his
lips
it
was
cold
and
trembling
and
raising
her
eyes
he
saw
the
paleness
of
her
countenance
tears
came
to
her
relief
and
valancourt
watched
in
anxious
silence
over
her
in
a
few
moments
she
recovered
herself
and
smiling
faintly
through
her
tears
said
â€œcan
you
excuse
this
weakness
my
spirits
have
not
yet
i
believe
recovered
from
the
shock
they
lately
receivedâ€
â€œi
cannot
excuse
myselfâ€
said
valancourt
â€œbut
i
will
forbear
to
renew
the
subject
which
may
have
contributed
to
agitate
them
now
that
i
can
leave
you
with
the
sweet
certainty
of
possessing
your
esteemâ€
then
forgetting
his
resolution
he
again
spoke
of
himself
â€œyou
know
notâ€
said
he
â€œthe
many
anxious
hours
i
have
passed
near
you
lately
when
you
believed
me
if
indeed
you
honoured
me
with
a
thought
far
away
i
have
wandered
near
the
chã¢teau
in
the
still
hours
of
the
night
when
no
eye
could
observe
me
it
was
delightful
to
know
i
was
so
near
you
and
there
was
something
particularly
soothing
in
the
thought
that
i
watched
round
your
habitation
while
you
slept
these
grounds
are
not
entirely
new
to
me
once
i
ventured
within
the
fence
and
spent
one
of
the
happiest
and
yet
most
melancholy
hours
of
my
life
in
walking
under
what
i
believed
to
be
your
windowâ€
emily
enquired
how
long
valancourt
had
been
in
the
neighbourhood
â€œseveral
daysâ€
he
replied
â€œit
was
my
design
to
avail
myself
of
the
permission
m
st
aubert
had
given
me
i
scarcely
know
how
to
account
for
it
but
though
i
anxiously
wished
to
do
this
my
resolution
always
failed
when
the
moment
approached
and
i
constantly
deferred
my
visit
i
lodged
in
a
village
at
some
distance
and
wandered
with
my
dogs
among
the
scenes
of
this
charming
country
wishing
continually
to
meet
you
yet
not
daring
to
visit
youâ€
having
thus
continued
to
converse
without
perceiving
the
flight
of
time
valancourt
at
length
seemed
to
recollect
himself
â€œi
must
goâ€
said
he
mournfully
â€œbut
it
is
with
the
hope
of
seeing
you
again
of
being
permitted
to
pay
my
respects
to
your
family
let
me
hear
this
hope
confirmed
by
your
voiceâ€
â€œmy
family
will
be
happy
to
see
any
friend
of
my
dear
fatherâ€
said
emily
valancourt
kissed
her
hand
and
still
lingered
unable
to
depart
while
emily
sat
silently
with
her
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
and
valancourt
as
he
gazed
on
her
considered
that
it
would
soon
be
impossible
for
him
to
recall
even
to
his
memory
the
exact
resemblance
of
the
beautiful
countenance
he
then
beheld
at
this
moment
a
hasty
footstep
approached
from
behind
the
plane-tree
and
turning
her
eyes
emily
saw
madame
cheron
she
felt
a
blush
steal
upon
her
cheek
and
her
frame
trembled
with
the
emotion
of
her
mind
but
she
instantly
rose
to
meet
her
visitor
â€œso
nieceâ€
said
madame
cheron
casting
a
look
of
surprise
and
enquiry
on
valancourt
â€œso
niece
how
do
you
do
but
i
need
not
ask
your
looks
tell
me
you
have
already
recovered
your
lossâ€
â€œmy
looks
do
me
injustice
then
madame
my
loss
i
know
can
never
be
recoveredâ€
â€œwellâ€”well
i
will
not
argue
with
you
i
see
you
have
exactly
your
fatherâ€™s
disposition
and
let
me
tell
you
it
would
have
been
much
happier
for
him
poor
man
if
it
had
been
a
different
oneâ€
a
look
of
dignified
displeasure
with
which
emily
regarded
madame
cheron
while
she
spoke
would
have
touched
almost
any
other
heart
she
made
no
other
reply
but
introduced
valancourt
who
could
scarcely
stifle
the
resentment
he
felt
and
whose
bow
madame
cheron
returned
with
a
slight
curtsy
and
a
look
of
supercilious
examination
after
a
few
moments
he
took
leave
of
emily
in
a
manner
that
hastily
expressed
his
pain
both
at
his
own
departure
and
at
leaving
her
to
the
society
of
madame
cheron
â€œwho
is
that
young
manâ€
said
her
aunt
in
an
accent
which
equally
implied
inquisitiveness
and
censure
â€œsome
idle
admirer
of
yours
i
suppose
but
i
believed
niece
you
had
a
greater
sense
of
propriety
than
to
have
received
the
visits
of
any
young
man
in
your
present
unfriended
situation
let
me
tell
you
the
world
will
observe
those
things
and
it
will
talk
aye
and
very
freely
tooâ€
emily
extremely
shocked
at
this
coarse
speech
attempted
to
interrupt
it
but
madame
cheron
would
proceed
with
all
the
self-importance
of
a
person
to
whom
power
is
new
â€œit
is
very
necessary
you
should
be
under
the
eye
of
some
person
more
able
to
guide
you
than
yourself
i
indeed
have
not
much
leisure
for
such
a
task
however
since
your
poor
father
made
it
his
last
request
that
i
should
overlook
your
conductâ€”i
must
even
take
you
under
my
care
but
this
let
me
tell
you
niece
that
unless
you
will
determine
to
be
very
conformable
to
my
direction
i
shall
not
trouble
myself
longer
about
youâ€
emily
made
no
attempt
to
interrupt
madame
cheron
a
second
time
grief
and
the
pride
of
conscious
innocence
kept
her
silent
till
her
aunt
said
â€œi
am
now
come
to
take
you
with
me
to
thoulouse
i
am
sorry
to
find
that
your
poor
father
died
after
all
in
such
indifferent
circumstances
however
i
shall
take
you
home
with
me
ah
poor
man
he
was
always
more
generous
than
provident
or
he
would
not
have
left
his
daughter
dependent
on
his
relationsâ€
â€œnor
has
he
done
so
i
hope
madamâ€
said
emily
calmly
â€œnor
did
his
pecuniary
misfortunes
arise
from
that
noble
generosity
which
always
distinguished
him
the
affairs
of
m
de
motteville
may
i
trust
yet
be
settled
without
deeply
injuring
his
creditors
and
in
the
meantime
i
should
be
very
happy
to
remain
at
la
vallã©eâ€
â€œno
doubt
you
wouldâ€
replied
madame
cheron
with
a
smile
of
irony
â€œand
i
shall
no
doubt
consent
to
this
since
i
see
how
necessary
tranquillity
and
retirement
are
to
restore
your
spirits
i
did
not
think
you
capable
of
so
much
duplicity
niece
when
you
pleaded
this
excuse
for
remaining
here
i
foolishly
believed
it
to
be
a
just
one
nor
expected
to
have
found
with
you
so
agreeable
a
companion
as
this
m
la
valâ€”
i
forget
his
nameâ€
emily
could
no
longer
endure
these
cruel
indignities
â€œit
was
a
just
one
madamâ€
said
she
â€œand
now
indeed
i
feel
more
than
ever
the
value
of
the
retirement
i
then
solicited
and
if
the
purport
of
your
visit
is
only
to
add
insult
to
the
sorrows
of
your
brotherâ€™s
child
she
could
well
have
spared
itâ€
â€œi
see
that
i
have
undertaken
a
very
troublesome
taskâ€
said
madame
cheron
colouring
highly
â€œi
am
sure
madamâ€
said
emily
mildly
and
endeavouring
to
restrain
her
tears
â€œi
am
sure
my
father
did
not
mean
it
should
be
such
i
have
the
happiness
to
reflect
that
my
conduct
under
his
eye
was
such
as
he
often
delighted
to
approve
it
would
be
very
painful
to
me
to
disobey
the
sister
of
such
a
parent
and
if
you
believe
the
task
will
really
be
so
troublesome
i
must
lament
that
it
is
yoursâ€
â€œwell
niece
fine
speaking
signifies
little
i
am
willing
in
consideration
of
my
poor
brother
to
overlook
the
impropriety
of
your
late
conduct
and
to
try
what
your
future
will
beâ€
emily
interrupted
her
to
beg
she
would
explain
what
was
the
impropriety
she
alluded
to
â€œwhat
impropriety
why
that
of
receiving
the
visits
of
a
lover
unknown
to
your
familyâ€
replied
madame
cheron
not
considering
the
impropriety
of
which
she
had
herself
been
guilty
in
exposing
her
niece
to
the
possibility
of
conduct
so
erroneous
a
faint
blush
passed
over
emilyâ€™s
countenance
pride
and
anxiety
struggled
in
her
breast
and
till
she
recollected
that
appearances
did
in
some
degree
justify
her
auntâ€™s
suspicions
she
could
not
resolve
to
humble
herself
so
far
as
to
enter
into
the
defence
of
a
conduct
which
had
been
so
innocent
and
undesigning
on
her
part
she
mentioned
the
manner
of
valancourtâ€™s
introduction
to
her
father
the
circumstances
of
his
receiving
the
pistol-shot
and
of
their
afterwards
travelling
together
with
the
accidental
way
in
which
she
had
met
him
on
the
preceding
evening
she
owned
he
had
declared
a
partiality
for
her
and
that
he
had
asked
permission
to
address
her
family
â€œand
who
is
this
young
adventurer
prayâ€
said
madame
cheron
â€œand
what
are
his
pretensionsâ€
â€œthese
he
must
himself
explain
madamâ€
replied
emily
â€œof
his
family
my
father
was
not
ignorant
and
i
believe
it
is
unexceptionableâ€
she
then
proceeded
to
mention
what
she
knew
concerning
it
â€œoh
then
this
it
seems
is
a
younger
brotherâ€
exclaimed
her
aunt
â€œand
of
course
a
beggar
a
very
fine
tale
indeed
and
so
my
brother
took
a
fancy
to
this
young
man
after
only
a
few
days
acquaintanceâ€”but
that
was
so
like
him
in
his
youth
he
was
always
taking
these
likes
and
dislikes
when
no
other
person
saw
any
reason
for
them
at
all
nay
indeed
i
have
often
thought
the
people
he
disapproved
were
much
more
agreeable
than
those
he
admiredâ€”but
there
is
no
accounting
for
tastes
he
was
always
so
much
influenced
by
peopleâ€™s
countenances
now
i
for
my
part
have
no
notion
of
this
it
is
all
ridiculous
enthusiasm
what
has
a
manâ€™s
face
to
do
with
his
character
can
a
man
of
good
character
help
having
a
disagreeable
faceâ€â€”which
last
sentence
madame
cheron
delivered
with
the
decisive
air
of
a
person
who
congratulates
herself
on
having
made
a
grand
discovery
and
believes
the
question
to
be
unanswerably
settled
emily
desirous
of
concluding
the
conversation
enquired
if
her
aunt
would
accept
some
refreshment
and
madame
cheron
accompanied
her
to
the
chã¢teau
but
without
desisting
from
a
topic
which
she
discussed
with
so
much
complacency
to
herself
and
severity
to
her
niece
â€œi
am
sorry
to
perceive
nieceâ€
said
she
in
allusion
to
somewhat
that
emily
had
said
concerning
physiognomy
â€œthat
you
have
a
great
many
of
your
fatherâ€™s
prejudices
and
among
them
those
sudden
predilections
for
people
from
their
looks
i
can
perceive
that
you
imagine
yourself
to
be
violently
in
love
with
this
young
adventurer
after
an
acquaintance
of
only
a
few
days
there
was
something
too
so
charmingly
romantic
in
the
manner
of
your
meetingâ€
emily
checked
the
tears
that
trembled
in
her
eyes
while
she
said
â€œwhen
my
conduct
shall
deserve
this
severity
madam
you
will
do
well
to
exercise
it
till
then
justice
if
not
tenderness
should
surely
restrain
it
i
have
never
willingly
offended
you
now
i
have
lost
my
parents
you
are
the
only
person
to
whom
i
can
look
for
kindness
let
me
not
lament
more
than
ever
the
loss
of
such
parentsâ€
the
last
words
were
almost
stifled
by
her
emotions
and
she
burst
into
tears
remembering
the
delicacy
and
the
tenderness
of
st
aubert
the
happy
happy
days
she
had
passed
in
these
scenes
and
contrasting
them
with
the
coarse
and
unfeeling
behaviour
of
madame
cheron
and
from
the
future
hours
of
mortification
she
must
submit
to
in
her
presenceâ€”a
degree
of
grief
seized
her
that
almost
reached
despair
madame
cheron
more
offended
by
the
reproof
which
emilyâ€™s
words
conveyed
than
touched
by
the
sorrow
they
expressed
said
nothing
that
might
soften
her
grief
but
notwithstanding
an
apparent
reluctance
to
receive
her
niece
she
desired
her
company
the
love
of
sway
was
her
ruling
passion
and
she
knew
it
would
be
highly
gratified
by
taking
into
her
house
a
young
orphan
who
had
no
appeal
from
her
decisions
and
on
whom
she
could
exercise
without
control
the
capricious
humour
of
the
moment
on
entering
the
chã¢teau
madame
cheron
expressed
a
desire
that
she
would
put
up
what
she
thought
necessary
to
take
to
thoulouse
as
she
meant
to
set
off
immediately
emily
now
tried
to
persuade
her
to
defer
the
journey
at
least
till
the
next
day
and
at
length
with
much
difficulty
prevailed
the
day
passed
in
the
exercise
of
petty
tyranny
on
the
part
of
madame
cheron
and
in
mournful
regret
and
melancholy
anticipation
on
that
of
emily
who
when
her
aunt
retired
to
her
apartment
for
the
night
went
to
take
leave
of
every
other
room
in
this
her
dear
native
home
which
she
was
now
quitting
for
she
knew
not
how
long
and
for
a
world
to
which
she
was
wholly
a
stranger
she
could
not
conquer
a
presentiment
which
frequently
occurred
to
her
this
nightâ€”that
she
should
never
more
return
to
la
vallã©e
having
passed
a
considerable
time
in
what
had
been
her
fatherâ€™s
study
having
selected
some
of
his
favourite
authors
to
put
up
with
her
clothes
and
shed
many
tears
as
she
wiped
the
dust
from
their
covers
she
seated
herself
in
his
chair
before
the
reading
desk
and
sat
lost
in
melancholy
reflection
till
theresa
opened
the
door
to
examine
as
was
her
custom
before
she
went
to
bed
it
was
all
safe
she
started
on
observing
her
young
lady
who
bade
her
come
in
and
then
gave
her
some
directions
for
keeping
the
chã¢teau
in
readiness
for
her
reception
at
all
times
â€œalas-a-day
that
you
should
leave
itâ€
said
theresa
â€œi
think
you
would
be
happier
here
than
where
you
are
going
if
one
may
judgeâ€
emily
made
no
reply
to
this
remark
the
sorrow
theresa
proceeded
to
express
at
her
departure
affected
her
but
she
found
some
comfort
in
the
simple
affection
of
this
poor
old
servant
to
whom
she
gave
such
directions
as
might
best
conduce
to
her
comfort
during
her
own
absence
having
dismissed
theresa
to
bed
emily
wandered
through
every
lonely
apartment
of
the
chã¢teau
lingering
long
in
what
had
been
her
fatherâ€™s
bedroom
indulging
melancholy
yet
not
unpleasing
emotions
and
having
often
returned
within
the
door
to
take
another
look
at
it
she
withdrew
to
her
own
chamber
from
her
window
she
gazed
upon
the
garden
below
shown
faintly
by
the
moon
rising
over
the
tops
of
the
palm-trees
and
at
length
the
calm
beauty
of
the
night
increased
a
desire
of
indulging
the
mournful
sweetness
of
bidding
farewell
to
the
beloved
shades
of
her
childhood
till
she
was
tempted
to
descend
throwing
over
her
the
light
veil
in
which
she
usually
walked
she
silently
passed
into
the
garden
and
hastening
towards
the
distant
groves
was
glad
to
breathe
once
more
the
air
of
liberty
and
to
sigh
unobserved
the
deep
repose
of
the
scene
the
rich
scents
that
floated
on
the
breeze
the
grandeur
of
the
wide
horizon
and
of
the
clear
blue
arch
soothed
and
gradually
elevated
her
mind
to
that
sublime
complacency
which
renders
the
vexations
of
this
world
so
insignificant
and
mean
in
our
eyes
that
we
wonder
they
have
had
power
for
a
moment
to
disturb
us
emily
forgot
madame
cheron
and
all
the
circumstances
of
her
conduct
while
her
thoughts
ascended
to
the
contemplation
of
those
unnumbered
worlds
that
lie
scattered
in
the
depths
of
ã¦ther
thousands
of
them
hid
from
human
eyes
and
almost
beyond
the
flight
of
human
fancy
as
her
imagination
soared
through
the
regions
of
space
and
aspired
to
that
great
first
cause
which
pervades
and
governs
all
being
the
idea
of
her
father
scarcely
ever
left
her
but
it
was
a
pleasing
idea
since
she
resigned
him
to
god
in
the
full
confidence
of
a
pure
and
holy
faith
she
pursued
her
way
through
the
groves
to
the
terrace
often
pausing
as
memory
awakened
the
pang
of
affection
and
as
reason
anticipated
the
exile
into
which
she
was
going
and
now
the
moon
was
high
over
the
woods
touching
their
summits
with
yellow
light
and
darting
between
the
foliage
long
level
beams
while
on
the
rapid
garonne
below
the
trembling
radiance
was
faintly
obscured
by
the
lightest
vapour
emily
long
watched
the
playing
lustre
listened
to
the
soothing
murmur
of
the
current
and
the
yet
lighter
sounds
of
the
air
as
it
stirred
at
intervals
the
lofty
palm-trees
â€œhow
delightful
is
the
sweet
breath
of
these
grovesâ€
said
she
â€œthis
lovely
sceneâ€”how
often
shall
i
remember
and
regret
it
when
i
am
far
away
alas
what
events
may
occur
before
i
see
it
again
o
peaceful
happy
shadesâ€”scenes
of
my
infant
delights
of
parental
tenderness
now
lost
for
everâ€”why
must
i
leave
yeâ€”in
your
retreats
i
should
still
find
safety
and
repose
sweet
hours
of
my
childhoodâ€”i
am
now
to
leave
even
your
last
memorials
no
objects
that
would
revive
your
impressions
will
remain
for
meâ€
then
drying
her
tears
and
looking
up
her
thoughts
rose
again
to
the
sublime
subject
she
had
contemplated
the
same
divine
complacency
stole
over
her
heart
and
hushing
its
throbs
inspired
hope
and
confidence
and
resignation
to
the
will
of
the
deity
whose
works
filled
her
mind
with
adoration
emily
gazed
long
on
the
plane-tree
and
then
seated
herself
for
the
last
time
on
the
bench
under
its
shade
where
she
had
so
often
sat
with
her
parents
and
where
only
a
few
hours
before
she
had
conversed
with
valancourt
at
the
remembrance
of
whom
thus
revived
a
mingled
sensation
of
esteem
tenderness
and
anxiety
rose
in
her
breast
with
this
remembrance
occurred
a
recollection
of
his
late
confessionâ€”that
he
had
often
wandered
near
her
habitation
in
the
night
having
even
passed
the
boundary
of
the
garden
and
it
immediately
occurred
to
her
that
he
might
be
at
this
moment
in
the
grounds
the
fear
of
meeting
him
particularly
after
the
declaration
he
had
made
and
of
incurring
a
censure
which
her
aunt
might
so
reasonably
bestow
if
it
was
known
that
she
was
met
by
her
lover
at
this
hour
made
her
instantly
leave
her
beloved
plane-tree
and
walk
towards
the
chã¢teau
she
cast
an
anxious
eye
around
and
often
stopped
for
a
moment
to
examine
the
shadowy
scene
before
she
ventured
to
proceed
but
she
passed
on
without
perceiving
any
person
till
having
reached
a
clump
of
almond
trees
not
far
from
the
house
she
rested
to
take
a
retrospect
of
the
garden
and
to
sigh
forth
another
adieu
as
her
eyes
wandered
over
the
landscape
she
thought
she
perceived
a
person
emerge
from
the
groves
and
pass
slowly
along
a
moonlight
alley
that
led
between
them
but
the
distance
and
the
imperfect
light
would
not
suffer
her
to
judge
with
any
degree
of
certainty
whether
this
was
fancy
or
reality
she
continued
to
gaze
for
some
time
on
the
spot
till
on
the
dead
stillness
of
the
air
she
heard
a
sudden
sound
and
in
the
next
instant
fancied
she
distinguished
footsteps
near
her
wasting
not
another
moment
in
conjecture
she
hurried
to
the
chã¢teau
and
having
reached
it
retired
to
her
chamber
where
as
she
closed
her
window
she
looked
upon
the
garden
and
then
again
thought
she
distinguished
a
figure
gliding
between
the
almond
trees
she
had
just
left
she
immediately
withdrew
from
the
casement
and
though
much
agitated
sought
in
sleep
the
refreshment
of
a
short
oblivion
i
leave
that
flowery
path
for
eye
of
childhood
where
i
sported
many
a
day
warbling
and
sauntering
carelessly
along
where
every
face
was
innocent
and
gay
each
vale
romantic
tuneful
every
tongueâ€”
sweet
wild
and
artless
all
the
minstrel
at
an
early
hour
the
carriage
which
was
to
take
emily
and
madame
cheron
to
thoulouse
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
chã¢teau
and
madame
was
already
in
the
breakfast-room
when
her
niece
entered
it
the
repast
was
silent
and
melancholy
on
the
part
of
emily
and
madame
cheron
whose
vanity
was
piqued
on
observing
her
dejection
reproved
her
in
a
manner
that
did
not
contribute
to
remove
it
it
was
with
much
reluctance
that
emilyâ€™s
request
to
take
with
her
the
dog
which
had
been
a
favourite
of
her
father
was
granted
her
aunt
impatient
to
be
gone
ordered
the
carriage
to
draw
up
and
while
she
passed
to
the
hall
door
emily
gave
another
look
into
the
library
and
another
farewell
glance
over
the
garden
and
then
followed
old
theresa
stood
at
the
door
to
take
leave
of
her
young
lady
â€œgod
for
ever
keep
you
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
she
while
emily
gave
her
hand
in
silence
and
could
answer
only
with
a
pressure
of
her
hand
and
a
forced
smile
at
the
gate
which
led
out
of
the
grounds
several
of
her
fatherâ€™s
pensioners
were
assembled
to
bid
her
farewell
to
whom
she
would
have
spoken
if
her
aunt
would
have
suffered
the
driver
to
stop
and
having
distributed
to
them
almost
all
the
money
she
had
about
her
she
sunk
back
in
the
carriage
yielding
to
the
melancholy
of
her
heart
soon
after
she
caught
between
the
steep
banks
of
the
road
another
view
of
the
chã¢teau
peeping
from
among
the
high
trees
and
surrounded
by
green
slopes
and
tufted
groves
the
garonne
winding
its
way
beneath
their
shades
sometimes
lost
among
the
vineyards
and
then
rising
in
greater
majesty
in
the
distant
pastures
the
towering
precipices
of
the
pyrenees
that
rose
to
the
south
gave
emily
a
thousand
interesting
recollections
of
her
late
journey
and
these
objects
of
her
former
enthusiastic
admiration
now
excited
only
sorrow
and
regret
having
gazed
on
the
chã¢teau
and
its
lovely
scenery
till
the
banks
again
closed
upon
them
her
mind
became
too
much
occupied
by
mournful
reflections
to
permit
her
to
attend
to
the
conversation
which
madame
cheron
had
begun
on
some
trivial
topic
so
that
they
soon
travelled
in
profound
silence
valancourt
meanwhile
was
returned
to
estuviã¨re
his
heart
occupied
with
the
image
of
emily
sometimes
indulging
in
reveries
of
future
happiness
but
more
frequently
shrinking
with
dread
of
the
opposition
he
might
encounter
from
her
family
he
was
the
younger
son
of
an
ancient
family
of
gascony
and
having
lost
his
parents
at
an
early
period
of
his
life
the
care
of
his
education
and
of
his
small
portion
had
devolved
to
his
brother
the
count
de
duvarney
his
senior
by
nearly
twenty
years
valancourt
had
been
educated
in
all
the
accomplishments
of
his
age
and
had
an
ardour
of
spirit
and
a
certain
grandeur
of
mind
that
gave
him
particular
excellence
in
the
exercises
then
thought
heroic
his
little
fortune
had
been
diminished
by
the
necessary
expences
of
his
education
but
m
la
valancourt
the
elder
seemed
to
think
that
his
genius
and
accomplishments
would
amply
supply
the
deficiency
of
his
inheritance
they
offered
flattering
hopes
of
promotion
in
the
military
profession
in
those
times
almost
the
only
one
in
which
a
gentleman
could
engage
without
incurring
a
stain
on
his
name
and
la
valancourt
was
of
course
enrolled
in
the
army
the
general
genius
of
his
mind
was
but
little
understood
by
his
brother
that
ardour
for
whatever
is
great
and
good
in
the
moral
world
as
well
as
in
the
natural
one
displayed
itself
in
his
infant
years
and
the
strong
indignation
which
he
felt
and
expressed
at
a
criminal
or
a
mean
action
sometimes
drew
upon
him
the
displeasure
of
his
tutor
who
reprobated
it
under
the
general
term
of
violence
of
temper
and
who
when
haranguing
on
the
virtues
of
mildness
and
moderation
seemed
to
forget
the
gentleness
and
compassion
which
always
appeared
in
his
pupil
towards
objects
of
misfortune
he
had
now
obtained
leave
of
absence
from
his
regiment
when
he
made
the
excursion
into
the
pyrenees
which
was
the
means
of
introducing
him
to
st
aubert
and
as
this
permission
was
nearly
expired
he
was
the
more
anxious
to
declare
himself
to
emilyâ€™s
family
from
whom
he
reasonably
apprehended
opposition
since
his
fortune
though
with
a
moderate
addition
from
hers
it
would
be
sufficient
to
support
them
would
not
satisfy
the
views
either
of
vanity
or
ambition
valancourt
was
not
without
the
latter
but
he
saw
golden
visions
of
promotion
in
the
army
and
believed
that
with
emily
he
could
in
the
mean
time
be
delighted
to
live
within
the
limits
of
his
humble
income
his
thoughts
were
now
occupied
in
considering
the
means
of
making
himself
known
to
her
family
to
whom
however
he
had
yet
no
address
for
he
was
entirely
ignorant
of
emilyâ€™s
precipitate
departure
from
la
vallã©e
of
whom
he
hoped
to
obtain
it
meanwhile
the
travellers
pursued
their
journey
emily
making
frequent
efforts
to
appear
cheerful
and
too
often
relapsing
into
silence
and
dejection
madame
cheron
attributing
her
melancholy
solely
to
the
circumstance
of
her
being
removed
to
a
distance
from
her
lover
and
believing
that
the
sorrow
which
her
niece
still
expressed
for
the
loss
of
st
aubert
proceeded
partly
from
an
affectation
of
sensibility
endeavoured
to
make
it
appear
ridiculous
to
her
that
such
deep
regret
should
continue
to
be
felt
so
long
after
the
period
usually
allowed
for
grief
at
length
these
unpleasant
lectures
were
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
travellers
at
thoulouse
and
emily
who
had
not
been
there
for
many
years
and
had
only
a
very
faint
recollection
of
it
was
surprised
at
the
ostentatious
style
exhibited
in
her
auntâ€™s
house
and
furniture
the
more
so
perhaps
because
it
was
so
totally
different
from
the
modest
elegance
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
she
followed
madame
cheron
through
a
large
hall
where
several
servants
in
rich
liveries
appeared
to
a
kind
of
saloon
fitted
up
with
more
show
than
taste
and
her
aunt
complaining
of
fatigue
ordered
supper
immediately
â€œi
am
glad
to
find
myself
in
my
own
house
againâ€
said
she
throwing
herself
on
a
large
settee
â€œand
to
have
my
own
people
about
me
i
detest
travelling
though
indeed
i
ought
to
like
it
for
what
i
see
abroad
always
makes
me
delighted
to
return
to
my
own
chã¢teau
what
makes
you
so
silent
childâ€”what
is
it
that
disturbs
you
nowâ€
emily
suppressed
a
starting
tear
and
tried
to
smile
away
the
expression
of
an
oppressed
heart
she
was
thinking
of
her
home
and
felt
too
sensibly
the
arrogance
and
ostentatious
vanity
of
madame
cheronâ€™s
conversation
â€œcan
this
be
my
fatherâ€™s
sisterâ€
said
she
to
herself
and
then
the
conviction
that
she
was
so
warming
her
heart
with
something
like
kindness
towards
her
she
felt
anxious
to
soften
the
harsh
impression
her
mind
had
received
of
her
auntâ€™s
character
and
to
show
a
willingness
to
oblige
her
the
effort
did
not
entirely
fail
she
listened
with
apparent
cheerfulness
while
madame
cheron
expatiated
on
the
splendour
of
her
house
told
of
the
numerous
parties
she
entertained
and
what
she
should
expect
of
emily
whose
diffidence
assumed
the
air
of
a
reserve
which
her
aunt
believing
it
to
be
that
of
pride
and
ignorance
united
now
took
occasion
to
reprehend
she
knew
nothing
of
the
conduct
of
a
mind
that
fears
to
trust
its
own
powers
which
possessing
a
nice
judgment
and
inclining
to
believe
that
every
other
person
perceives
still
more
critically
fears
to
commit
itself
to
censure
and
seeks
shelter
in
the
obscurity
of
silence
emily
had
frequently
blushed
at
the
fearless
manners
which
she
had
seen
admired
and
the
brilliant
nothings
which
she
had
heard
applauded
yet
this
applause
so
far
from
encouraging
her
to
imitate
the
conduct
that
had
won
it
rather
made
her
shrink
into
the
reserve
that
would
protect
her
from
such
absurdity
madame
cheron
looked
on
her
nieceâ€™s
diffidence
with
a
feeling
very
near
to
contempt
and
endeavoured
to
overcome
it
by
reproof
rather
than
to
encourage
it
by
gentleness
the
entrance
of
supper
somewhat
interrupted
the
complacent
discourse
of
madame
cheron
and
the
painful
considerations
which
it
had
forced
upon
emily
when
the
repast
which
was
rendered
ostentatious
by
the
attendance
of
a
great
number
of
servants
and
by
a
profusion
of
plate
was
over
madame
cheron
retired
to
her
chamber
and
a
female
servant
came
to
show
emily
to
hers
having
passed
up
a
large
staircase
and
through
several
galleries
they
came
to
a
flight
of
back
stairs
which
led
into
a
short
passage
in
a
remote
part
of
the
chã¢teau
and
there
the
servant
opened
the
door
of
a
small
chamber
which
she
said
was
maâ€™amselle
emilyâ€™s
who
once
more
alone
indulged
the
tears
she
had
long
tried
to
restrain
those
who
know
from
experience
how
much
the
heart
becomes
attached
even
to
inanimate
objects
to
which
it
has
been
long
accustomed
how
unwillingly
it
resigns
them
how
with
the
sensations
of
an
old
friend
it
meets
them
after
temporary
absence
will
understand
the
forlornness
of
emilyâ€™s
feelings
of
emily
shut
out
from
the
only
home
she
had
known
from
her
infancy
and
thrown
upon
a
scene
and
among
persons
disagreeable
for
more
qualities
than
their
novelty
her
fatherâ€™s
favourite
dog
now
in
the
chamber
thus
seemed
to
acquire
the
character
and
importance
of
a
friend
and
as
the
animal
fawned
over
her
when
she
wept
and
licked
her
hands
â€œah
poor
manchonâ€
said
she
â€œi
have
nobody
now
to
love
meâ€”but
youâ€
and
she
wept
the
more
after
some
time
her
thoughts
returning
to
her
fatherâ€™s
injunctions
she
remembered
how
often
he
had
blamed
her
for
indulging
useless
sorrow
how
often
he
had
pointed
out
to
her
the
necessity
of
fortitude
and
patience
assuring
her
that
the
faculties
of
the
mind
strengthen
by
exertion
till
they
finally
unnerve
affliction
and
triumph
over
it
these
recollections
dried
her
tears
gradually
soothed
her
spirits
and
inspired
her
with
the
sweet
emulation
of
practising
precepts
which
her
father
had
so
frequently
inculcated
some
powâ€™r
impart
the
spear
and
shield
at
which
the
wizard
passions
fly
by
which
the
giant
follies
die
collins
madame
cheronâ€™s
house
stood
at
a
little
distance
from
the
city
of
thoulouse
and
was
surrounded
by
extensive
gardens
in
which
emily
who
had
risen
early
amused
herself
with
wandering
before
breakfast
from
a
terrace
that
extended
along
the
highest
part
of
them
was
a
wide
view
over
languedoc
on
the
distant
horizon
to
the
south
she
discovered
the
wild
summits
of
the
pyrenees
and
her
fancy
immediately
painted
the
green
pastures
of
gascony
at
their
feet
her
heart
pointed
to
her
peaceful
homeâ€”to
the
neighbourhood
where
valancourt
wasâ€”where
st
aubert
had
been
and
her
imagination
piercing
the
veil
of
distance
brought
that
home
to
her
eyes
in
all
its
interesting
and
romantic
beauty
she
experienced
an
inexpressible
pleasure
in
believing
that
she
beheld
the
country
around
it
though
no
feature
could
be
distinguished
except
the
retiring
chain
of
the
pyrenees
and
inattentive
to
the
scene
immediately
before
her
and
to
the
flight
of
time
she
continued
to
lean
on
the
window
of
a
pavilion
that
terminated
the
terrace
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
gascony
and
her
mind
occupied
with
the
interesting
ideas
which
the
view
of
it
awakened
till
a
servant
came
to
tell
her
breakfast
was
ready
her
thoughts
thus
recalled
to
the
surrounding
objects
the
straight
walks
square
parterres
and
artificial
fountains
of
the
garden
could
not
fail
as
she
passed
through
it
to
appear
the
worse
opposed
to
the
negligent
graces
and
natural
beauties
of
the
grounds
of
la
vallã©e
upon
which
her
recollection
had
been
so
intensely
employed
â€œwhither
have
you
been
rambling
so
earlyâ€
said
madame
cheron
as
her
niece
entered
the
breakfast-room
â€œi
donâ€™t
approve
of
these
solitary
walksâ€
and
emily
was
surprised
when
having
informed
her
aunt
that
she
had
been
no
further
than
the
gardens
she
understood
these
to
be
included
in
the
reproof
â€œi
desire
you
will
not
walk
there
again
at
so
early
an
hour
unattendedâ€
said
madame
cheron
â€œmy
gardens
are
very
extensive
and
a
young
woman
who
can
make
assignations
by
moonlight
at
la
vallã©e
is
not
to
be
trusted
to
her
own
inclinations
elsewhereâ€
emily
extremely
surprised
and
shocked
had
scarcely
power
to
beg
an
explanation
of
these
words
and
when
she
did
her
aunt
absolutely
refused
to
give
it
though
by
her
severe
looks
and
half
sentences
she
appeared
anxious
to
impress
emily
with
a
belief
that
she
was
well
informed
of
some
degrading
circumstances
of
her
conduct
conscious
innocence
could
not
prevent
a
blush
from
stealing
over
emilyâ€™s
cheek
she
trembled
and
looked
confusedly
under
the
bold
eye
of
madame
cheron
who
blushed
also
but
hers
was
the
blush
of
triumph
such
as
sometimes
stains
the
countenance
of
a
person
congratulating
himself
on
the
penetration
which
had
taught
him
to
suspect
another
and
who
loses
both
pity
for
the
supposed
criminal
and
indignation
of
his
guilt
in
the
gratification
of
his
own
vanity
emily
not
doubting
that
her
auntâ€™s
mistake
arose
from
the
having
observed
her
ramble
in
the
garden
on
the
night
preceding
her
departure
from
la
vallã©e
now
mentioned
the
motive
of
it
at
which
madame
cheron
smiled
contemptuously
refusing
either
to
accept
this
explanation
or
to
give
her
reasons
for
refusing
it
and
soon
after
she
concluded
the
subject
by
saying
â€œi
never
trust
peopleâ€™s
assertions
i
always
judge
of
them
by
their
actions
but
i
am
willing
to
try
what
will
be
your
behaviour
in
futureâ€
emily
less
surprised
by
her
auntâ€™s
moderation
and
mysterious
silence
than
by
the
accusation
she
had
received
deeply
considered
the
latter
and
scarcely
doubted
that
it
was
valancourt
whom
she
had
seen
at
night
in
the
gardens
of
la
vallã©e
and
that
he
had
been
observed
there
by
madame
cheron
who
now
passing
from
one
painful
topic
only
to
revive
another
almost
equally
so
spoke
of
the
situation
of
her
nieceâ€™s
property
in
the
hands
of
m
motteville
while
she
thus
talked
with
ostentatious
pity
of
emilyâ€™s
misfortunes
she
failed
not
to
inculcate
the
duties
of
humility
and
gratitude
or
to
render
emily
fully
sensible
of
every
cruel
mortification
who
soon
perceived
that
she
was
to
be
considered
as
a
dependant
not
only
by
her
aunt
but
by
her
auntâ€™s
servants
she
was
now
informed
that
a
large
party
were
expected
to
dinner
on
which
account
madame
cheron
repeated
the
lesson
of
the
preceding
night
concerning
her
conduct
in
company
and
emily
wished
that
she
might
have
courage
enough
to
practise
it
her
aunt
then
proceeded
to
examine
the
simplicity
of
her
dress
adding
that
she
expected
to
see
her
attired
with
gaiety
and
taste
after
which
she
condescended
to
show
emily
the
splendour
of
her
chã¢teau
and
to
point
out
the
particular
beauty
or
elegance
which
she
thought
distinguished
each
of
her
numerous
suites
of
apartments
she
then
withdrew
to
her
toilet
the
throne
of
her
homage
and
emily
to
her
chamber
to
unpack
her
books
and
to
try
to
charm
her
mind
by
reading
till
the
hour
of
dressing
when
the
company
arrived
emily
entered
the
saloon
with
an
air
of
timidity
which
all
her
efforts
could
not
overcome
and
which
was
increased
by
the
consciousness
of
madame
cheronâ€™s
severe
observation
her
mourning
dress
the
mild
dejection
of
her
beautiful
countenance
and
the
retiring
diffidence
of
her
manner
rendered
her
a
very
interesting
object
to
many
of
the
company
among
whom
she
distinguished
signor
montoni
and
his
friend
cavigni
the
late
visitors
at
m
quesnelâ€™s
who
now
seemed
to
converse
with
madame
cheron
with
the
familiarity
of
old
acquaintance
and
she
to
attend
to
them
with
particular
pleasure
this
signor
montoni
had
an
air
of
conscious
superiority
animated
by
spirit
and
strengthened
by
talents
to
which
every
person
seemed
involuntarily
to
yield
the
quickness
of
his
perceptions
was
strikingly
expressed
on
his
countenance
yet
that
countenance
could
submit
implicitly
to
occasion
and
more
than
once
in
this
day
the
triumph
of
art
over
nature
might
have
been
discerned
in
it
his
visage
was
long
and
rather
narrow
yet
he
was
called
handsome
and
it
was
perhaps
the
spirit
and
vigour
of
his
soul
sparkling
through
his
features
that
triumphed
for
him
emily
felt
admiration
but
not
the
admiration
that
leads
to
esteem
for
it
was
mixed
with
a
degree
of
fear
she
knew
not
exactly
wherefore
cavigni
was
gay
and
insinuating
as
formerly
and
though
he
paid
almost
incessant
attention
to
madame
cheron
he
found
some
opportunities
of
conversing
with
emily
to
whom
he
directed
at
first
the
sallies
of
his
wit
but
now
and
then
assumed
an
air
of
tenderness
which
she
observed
and
shrunk
from
though
she
replied
but
little
the
gentleness
and
sweetness
of
her
manners
encouraged
him
to
talk
and
she
felt
relieved
when
a
young
lady
of
the
party
who
spoke
incessantly
obtruded
herself
on
his
notice
this
lady
who
possessed
all
the
sprightliness
of
a
frenchwoman
with
all
her
coquetry
affected
to
understand
every
subject
or
rather
there
was
no
affectation
in
the
case
for
never
looking
beyond
the
limits
of
her
own
ignorance
she
believed
she
had
nothing
to
learn
she
attracted
notice
from
all
amused
some
disgusted
others
for
a
moment
and
was
then
forgotten
this
day
passed
without
any
material
occurrence
and
emily
though
amused
by
the
characters
she
had
seen
was
glad
when
she
could
retire
to
the
recollections
which
had
acquired
with
her
the
character
of
duties
a
fortnight
passed
in
a
round
of
dissipation
and
company
and
emily
who
attended
madame
cheron
in
all
her
visits
was
sometimes
entertained
but
oftener
wearied
she
was
struck
by
the
apparent
talents
and
knowledge
displayed
in
the
various
conversations
she
listened
to
and
it
was
long
before
she
discovered
that
the
talents
were
for
the
most
part
those
of
imposture
and
the
knowledge
nothing
more
than
was
necessary
to
assist
them
but
what
deceived
her
most
was
the
air
of
constant
gaiety
and
good
spirits
displayed
by
every
visitor
and
which
she
supposed
to
arise
from
content
as
constant
and
from
benevolence
as
ready
at
length
from
the
over-acting
of
some
less
accomplished
than
the
others
she
could
perceive
that
though
contentment
and
benevolence
are
the
only
sure
sources
of
cheerfulness
the
immoderate
and
feverish
animation
usually
exhibited
in
large
parties
results
partly
from
an
insensibility
to
the
cares
which
benevolence
must
sometimes
derive
from
the
sufferings
of
others
and
partly
from
a
desire
to
display
the
appearance
of
that
prosperity
which
they
know
will
command
submission
and
attention
to
themselves
emilyâ€™s
pleasantest
hours
were
passed
in
the
pavilion
of
the
terrace
to
which
she
retired
when
she
could
steal
from
observation
with
a
book
to
overcome
or
a
lute
to
indulge
her
melancholy
there
as
she
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
far-distant
pyrenees
and
her
thoughts
on
valancourt
and
the
beloved
scenes
of
gascony
she
would
play
the
sweet
and
melancholy
songs
of
her
native
provinceâ€”the
popular
songs
she
had
listened
to
from
her
childhood
one
evening
having
excused
herself
from
accompanying
her
aunt
abroad
she
thus
withdrew
to
the
pavilion
with
books
and
her
lute
it
was
the
mild
and
beautiful
evening
of
a
sultry
day
and
the
windows
which
fronted
the
west
opened
upon
all
the
glory
of
a
setting
sun
its
rays
illuminated
with
strong
splendour
the
cliffs
of
the
pyrenees
and
touched
their
snowy
tops
with
a
roseate
hue
that
remained
long
after
the
sun
had
sunk
below
the
horizon
and
the
shades
of
twilight
had
stolen
over
the
landscape
emily
touched
her
lute
with
that
fine
melancholy
expression
which
came
from
her
heart
the
pensive
hour
and
the
scene
the
evening
light
on
the
garonne
that
flowed
at
no
great
distance
and
whose
waves
as
they
passed
towards
la
vallã©e
she
often
viewed
with
a
sighâ€”these
united
circumstances
disposed
her
mind
to
tenderness
and
her
thoughts
were
with
valancourt
of
whom
she
had
heard
nothing
since
her
arrival
at
thoulouse
and
now
that
she
was
removed
from
him
and
in
uncertainty
she
perceived
all
the
interest
he
held
in
her
heart
before
she
saw
valancourt
she
had
never
met
a
mind
and
taste
so
accordant
with
her
own
and
though
madame
cheron
told
her
much
of
the
arts
of
dissimulation
and
that
the
elegance
and
propriety
of
thought
which
she
so
much
admired
in
her
lover
were
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
pleasing
her
she
could
scarcely
doubt
their
truth
this
possibility
however
faint
as
it
was
was
sufficient
to
harass
her
mind
with
anxiety
and
she
found
that
few
conditions
are
more
painful
than
that
of
uncertainty
as
to
the
merit
of
a
beloved
object
an
uncertainty
which
she
would
not
have
suffered
had
her
confidence
in
her
own
opinions
been
greater
she
was
awakened
from
her
musing
by
the
sound
of
horsesâ€™
feet
along
a
road
that
wound
under
the
windows
of
the
pavilion
and
a
gentleman
passed
on
horseback
whose
resemblance
to
valancourt
in
air
and
figure
for
the
twilight
did
not
permit
a
view
of
his
features
immediately
struck
her
she
retired
hastily
from
the
lattice
fearing
to
be
seen
yet
wishing
to
observe
further
while
the
stranger
passed
on
without
looking
up
and
when
she
returned
to
the
lattice
she
saw
him
faintly
through
the
twilight
winding
under
the
high
trees
that
led
to
thoulouse
this
little
incident
so
much
disturbed
her
spirits
that
the
temple
and
its
scenery
were
no
longer
interesting
to
her
and
after
walking
a
while
on
the
terrace
she
returned
to
the
chã¢teau
madame
cheron
whether
she
had
seen
a
rival
admired
had
lost
at
play
or
had
witnessed
an
entertainment
more
splendid
than
her
own
was
returned
from
her
visit
with
a
temper
more
than
usually
discomposed
and
emily
was
glad
when
the
hour
arrived
in
which
she
could
retire
to
the
solitude
of
her
own
apartment
on
the
following
morning
she
was
summoned
to
madame
cheron
whose
countenance
was
inflamed
with
resentment
and
as
emily
advanced
she
held
out
a
letter
to
her
â€œdo
you
know
this
handâ€
said
she
in
a
severe
tone
and
with
a
look
that
was
intended
to
search
her
heart
while
emily
examined
the
letter
attentively
and
assured
her
that
she
did
not
â€œdo
not
provoke
meâ€
said
her
aunt
â€œyou
do
know
it
confess
the
truth
immediately
i
insist
upon
your
confessing
the
truth
instantlyâ€
emily
was
silent
and
turned
to
leave
the
room
but
madame
called
her
back
â€œo
you
are
guilty
thenâ€
said
she
â€œyou
do
know
the
handâ€
â€œif
you
were
before
in
doubt
of
this
madamâ€
replied
emily
calmly
â€œwhy
did
you
accuse
me
of
having
told
a
falsehoodâ€
madame
cheron
did
not
blush
but
her
niece
did
a
moment
after
when
she
heard
the
name
of
valancourt
it
was
not
however
with
the
consciousness
of
deserving
reproof
for
if
she
ever
had
seen
his
hand-writing
the
present
characters
did
not
bring
it
to
her
recollection
â€œit
is
useless
to
deny
itâ€
said
madame
cheron
â€œi
see
in
your
countenance
that
you
are
no
stranger
to
this
letter
and
i
dare
say
you
have
received
many
such
from
this
impertinent
young
man
without
my
knowledge
in
my
own
houseâ€
emily
shocked
at
the
indelicacy
of
this
accusation
still
more
than
by
the
vulgarity
of
the
former
instantly
forgot
the
pride
that
had
imposed
silence
and
endeavoured
to
vindicate
herself
from
the
aspersion
but
madame
cheron
was
not
to
be
convinced
â€œi
cannot
supposeâ€
she
resumed
â€œthat
this
young
man
would
have
taken
the
liberty
of
writing
to
me
if
you
had
not
encouraged
him
to
do
so
and
i
must
nowâ€
â€œyou
will
allow
me
to
remind
you
madamâ€
said
emily
timidly
â€œof
some
particulars
of
a
conversation
we
had
at
la
vallã©e
i
then
told
you
truly
that
i
had
only
not
forbade
monsieur
valancourt
from
addressing
my
familyâ€
â€œi
will
not
be
interruptedâ€
said
madame
cheron
interrupting
her
niece
â€œi
was
going
to
sayâ€”iâ€”iâ€”have
forgot
what
i
was
going
to
say
but
how
happened
it
that
you
did
not
forbid
himâ€
emily
was
silent
â€œhow
happened
it
that
you
encouraged
him
to
trouble
me
with
this
letterâ€”a
young
man
that
nobody
knowsâ€”an
utter
stranger
in
the
placeâ€”a
young
adventurer
no
doubt
who
is
looking
out
for
a
good
fortune
however
on
that
point
he
has
mistaken
his
aimâ€
â€œhis
family
was
known
to
my
fatherâ€
said
emily
modestly
and
without
appearing
to
be
sensible
of
the
last
sentence
â€œo
that
is
no
recommendation
at
allâ€
replied
her
aunt
with
her
usual
readiness
upon
this
topic
â€œhe
took
such
strange
fancies
to
people
he
was
always
judging
persons
by
their
countenances
and
was
continually
deceivedâ€
â€œyet
it
was
but
now
madam
that
you
judged
me
guilty
by
my
countenanceâ€
said
emily
with
a
design
of
reproving
madame
cheron
to
which
she
was
induced
by
this
disrespectful
mention
of
her
father
â€œi
called
you
hereâ€
resumed
her
aunt
colouring
â€œto
tell
you
that
i
will
not
be
disturbed
in
my
own
house
by
any
letters
or
visits
from
young
men
who
may
take
a
fancy
to
flatter
you
this
m
de
valantineâ€”i
think
you
call
him
has
the
impertinence
to
beg
i
will
permit
him
to
pay
his
respects
to
me
i
shall
send
him
a
proper
answer
and
for
you
emily
i
repeat
it
once
for
allâ€”if
you
are
not
contented
to
conform
to
my
directions
and
to
my
way
of
live
i
shall
give
up
the
task
of
overlooking
your
conductâ€”i
shall
no
longer
trouble
myself
with
your
education
but
shall
send
you
to
board
in
a
conventâ€
â€œdear
madamâ€
said
emily
bursting
into
tears
and
overcome
by
the
rude
suspicions
her
aunt
had
expressed
â€œhow
have
i
deserved
these
reproofsâ€
she
could
say
no
more
and
so
very
fearful
was
she
of
acting
with
any
degree
of
impropriety
in
the
affair
itself
that
at
the
present
moment
madame
cheron
might
perhaps
have
prevailed
with
her
to
bind
herself
by
a
promise
to
renounce
valancourt
for
ever
her
mind
weakened
by
her
terrors
would
no
longer
suffer
her
to
view
him
as
she
had
formerly
done
she
feared
the
error
of
her
own
judgment
not
that
of
madame
cheron
and
feared
also
that
in
her
former
conversation
with
him
at
la
vallã©e
she
had
not
conducted
herself
with
sufficient
reserve
she
knew
that
she
did
not
deserve
the
coarse
suspicions
which
her
aunt
had
thrown
out
but
a
thousand
scruples
rose
to
torment
her
such
as
would
never
have
disturbed
the
peace
of
madame
cheron
thus
rendered
anxious
to
avoid
every
opportunity
of
erring
and
willing
to
submit
to
any
restrictions
that
her
aunt
should
think
proper
she
expressed
an
obedience
to
which
madame
cheron
did
not
give
much
confidence
and
which
she
seemed
to
consider
as
the
consequence
of
either
fear
or
artifice
â€œwell
thenâ€
said
she
â€œpromise
me
that
you
will
neither
see
this
young
man
nor
write
to
him
without
my
consentâ€
â€œdear
madamâ€
replied
emily
â€œcan
you
suppose
i
would
do
either
unknown
to
youâ€
â€œi
donâ€™t
know
what
to
suppose
there
is
no
knowing
how
young
women
will
act
it
is
difficult
to
place
any
confidence
in
them
for
they
have
seldom
sense
enough
to
wish
for
the
respect
of
the
worldâ€
â€œalas
madamâ€
said
emily
â€œi
am
anxious
for
my
own
respect
my
father
taught
me
the
value
of
that
he
said
if
i
deserved
my
own
esteem
that
the
world
would
follow
of
courseâ€
â€œmy
brother
was
a
good
kind
of
a
manâ€
replied
madame
cheron
â€œbut
he
did
not
know
the
world
i
am
sure
i
have
always
felt
a
proper
respect
for
myself
yetâ€”â€
she
stopped
but
she
might
have
added
that
the
world
had
not
always
shown
respect
to
her
and
this
without
impeaching
its
judgment
â€œwellâ€
resumed
madame
cheron
â€œyou
have
not
given
me
the
promise
though
that
i
demandâ€
emily
readily
gave
it
and
being
then
suffered
to
withdraw
she
walked
in
the
garden
tried
to
compose
her
spirits
and
at
length
arrived
at
her
favourite
pavilion
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
where
seating
herself
at
one
of
the
embowered
windows
that
opened
upon
a
balcony
the
stillness
and
seclusion
of
the
scene
allowed
her
to
recollect
her
thoughts
and
to
arrange
them
so
as
to
form
a
clearer
judgment
of
her
former
conduct
she
endeavoured
to
review
with
exactness
all
the
particulars
of
her
conversation
with
valancourt
at
la
vallã©e
had
the
satisfaction
to
observe
nothing
that
could
alarm
her
delicate
pride
and
thus
to
be
confirmed
in
the
self-esteem
which
was
so
necessary
to
her
peace
her
mind
then
became
tranquil
and
she
saw
valancourt
amiable
and
intelligent
as
he
had
formerly
appeared
and
madame
cheron
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
the
remembrance
of
her
lover
however
brought
with
it
many
very
painful
emotions
for
it
by
no
means
reconciled
her
to
the
thought
of
resigning
him
and
madame
cheron
having
already
shown
how
highly
she
disapproved
of
the
attachment
she
foresaw
much
suffering
from
the
opposition
of
interests
yet
with
all
this
was
mingled
a
degree
of
delight
which
in
spite
of
reason
partook
of
hope
she
determined
however
that
no
consideration
should
induce
her
to
permit
a
clandestine
correspondence
and
to
observe
in
her
conversation
with
valancourt
should
they
ever
meet
again
the
same
nicety
of
reserve
which
had
hitherto
marked
her
conduct
as
she
repeated
the
wordsâ€”â€œshould
we
ever
meet
againâ€
she
shrunk
as
if
this
was
a
circumstance
which
had
never
before
occurred
to
her
and
tears
came
to
her
eyes
which
she
hastily
dried
for
she
heard
footsteps
approaching
and
then
the
door
of
the
pavilion
open
and
on
turning
she
sawâ€”valancourt
an
emotion
of
mingled
pleasure
surprise
and
apprehension
pressed
so
suddenly
upon
her
heart
as
almost
to
overcome
her
spirits
the
colour
left
her
cheeks
then
returned
brighter
than
before
and
she
was
for
a
moment
unable
to
speak
or
to
rise
from
her
chair
his
countenance
was
the
mirror
in
which
she
saw
her
own
emotions
reflected
and
it
roused
her
to
self-command
the
joy
which
had
animated
his
features
when
he
entered
the
pavilion
was
suddenly
repressed
as
approaching
he
perceived
her
agitation
and
in
a
tremulous
voice
enquired
after
her
health
recovered
from
her
first
surprise
she
answered
him
with
a
tempered
smile
but
a
variety
of
opposite
emotions
still
assailed
her
heart
and
struggled
to
subdue
the
mild
dignity
of
her
manner
it
was
difficult
to
tell
which
predominatedâ€”the
joy
of
seeing
valancourt
or
the
terror
of
her
auntâ€™s
displeasure
when
she
should
hear
of
this
meeting
after
some
short
and
embarrassed
conversation
she
led
him
into
the
gardens
and
enquired
if
he
had
seen
madame
cheron
â€œnoâ€
said
he
â€œi
have
not
yet
seen
her
for
they
told
me
she
was
engaged
and
as
soon
as
i
learned
that
you
were
in
the
gardens
i
came
hitherâ€
he
paused
a
moment
in
great
agitation
and
then
added
â€œmay
i
venture
to
tell
you
the
purport
of
my
visit
without
incurring
your
displeasure
and
to
hope
that
you
will
not
accuse
me
of
precipitation
in
now
availing
myself
of
the
permission
you
once
gave
me
of
addressing
your
familyâ€
emily
who
knew
not
what
to
reply
was
spared
from
further
perplexity
and
was
sensible
only
of
fear
when
on
raising
her
eyes
she
saw
madame
cheron
turn
into
the
avenue
as
the
consciousness
of
innocence
returned
this
fear
was
so
far
dissipated
as
to
permit
her
to
appear
tranquil
and
instead
of
avoiding
her
aunt
she
advanced
with
valancourt
to
meet
her
the
look
of
haughty
and
impatient
displeasure
with
which
madame
cheron
regarded
them
made
emily
shrink
who
understood
from
a
single
glance
that
this
meeting
was
believed
to
have
been
more
than
accidental
having
mentioned
valancourtâ€™s
name
she
became
again
too
much
agitated
to
remain
with
them
and
returned
into
the
chã¢teau
where
she
awaited
long
in
a
state
of
trembling
anxiety
the
conclusion
of
the
conference
she
knew
not
how
to
account
for
valancourtâ€™s
visit
to
her
aunt
before
he
had
received
the
permission
he
solicited
since
she
was
ignorant
of
a
circumstance
which
would
have
rendered
the
request
useless
even
if
madame
cheron
had
been
inclined
to
grant
it
valancourt
in
the
agitation
of
his
spirits
had
forgotten
to
date
his
letter
so
that
it
was
impossible
for
madame
cheron
to
return
an
answer
and
when
he
recollected
this
circumstance
he
was
perhaps
not
so
sorry
for
the
omission
as
glad
of
the
excuse
it
allowed
him
for
waiting
on
her
before
she
could
send
a
refusal
madame
cheron
had
a
long
conversation
with
valancourt
and
when
she
returned
to
the
chã¢teau
her
countenance
expressed
ill-humour
but
not
the
degree
of
severity
which
emily
had
apprehended
â€œi
have
dismissed
this
young
man
at
lastâ€
said
she
â€œand
i
hope
my
house
will
never
again
be
disturbed
with
similar
visits
he
assures
me
that
your
interview
was
not
preconcertedâ€
â€œdear
madamâ€
said
emily
in
extreme
emotion
â€œyou
surely
did
not
ask
him
the
questionâ€
â€œmost
certainly
i
did
you
could
not
suppose
i
should
be
so
imprudent
as
to
neglect
itâ€
â€œgood
godâ€
exclaimed
emily
â€œwhat
an
opinion
must
he
form
of
me
since
you
madam
could
express
a
suspicion
of
such
ill
conductâ€
â€œit
is
of
very
little
consequence
what
opinion
he
may
form
of
youâ€
replied
her
aunt
â€œfor
i
have
put
an
end
to
the
affair
but
i
believe
he
will
not
form
a
worse
opinion
of
me
for
my
prudent
conduct
i
let
him
see
that
i
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
and
that
i
had
more
delicacy
than
to
permit
any
clandestine
correspondence
to
be
carried
on
in
my
houseâ€
emily
had
frequently
heard
madame
cheron
use
the
word
delicacy
but
she
was
now
more
than
usually
perplexed
to
understand
how
she
meant
to
apply
it
in
this
instance
in
which
her
whole
conduct
appeared
to
merit
the
very
reverse
of
the
term
â€œit
was
very
inconsiderate
of
my
brotherâ€
resumed
madame
cheron
â€œto
leave
the
trouble
of
overlooking
your
conduct
to
me
i
wish
you
were
well
settled
in
life
but
if
i
find
that
i
am
to
be
further
troubled
with
such
visitors
as
this
m
valancourt
i
shall
place
you
in
a
convent
at
onceâ€”so
remember
the
alternative
this
young
man
has
the
impertinence
to
own
to
meâ€”he
owns
it
that
his
fortune
is
very
small
and
that
he
is
chiefly
dependent
on
an
elder
brother
and
on
the
profession
he
has
chosen
he
should
have
concealed
these
circumstances
at
least
if
he
expected
to
succeed
with
me
had
he
the
presumption
to
suppose
i
would
marry
my
niece
to
a
person
such
as
he
describes
himselfâ€
emily
dried
her
tears
when
she
heard
of
the
candid
confession
of
valancourt
and
though
the
circumstances
it
discovered
were
afflicting
to
her
hopes
his
artless
conduct
gave
her
a
degree
of
pleasure
that
overcame
every
other
emotion
but
she
was
compelled
even
thus
early
in
life
to
observe
that
good
sense
and
noble
integrity
are
not
always
sufficient
to
cope
with
folly
and
narrow
cunning
and
her
heart
was
pure
enough
to
allow
her
even
at
this
trying
moment
to
look
with
more
pride
on
the
defeat
of
the
former
than
with
mortification
on
the
conquests
of
the
latter
madame
cheron
pursued
her
triumph
â€œhe
has
also
thought
proper
to
tell
me
that
he
will
receive
his
dismission
from
no
person
but
yourself
this
favour
however
i
have
absolutely
refused
him
he
shall
learn
that
it
is
quite
sufficient
that
i
disapprove
him
and
i
take
this
opportunity
of
repeatingâ€”that
if
you
concert
any
means
of
interview
unknown
to
me
you
shall
leave
my
house
immediatelyâ€
â€œhow
little
do
you
know
me
madam
that
you
should
think
such
an
injunction
necessaryâ€
said
emily
trying
to
suppress
her
emotion
â€œhow
little
of
the
dear
parents
who
educated
meâ€
madame
cheron
now
went
to
dress
for
an
engagement
which
she
had
made
for
the
evening
and
emily
who
would
gladly
have
been
excused
from
attending
her
aunt
did
not
ask
to
remain
at
home
lest
her
request
should
be
attributed
to
an
improper
motive
when
she
retired
to
her
own
room
the
little
fortitude
which
had
supported
her
in
the
presence
of
her
relation
forsook
her
she
remembered
only
that
valancourt
whose
character
appeared
more
amiable
from
every
circumstance
that
unfolded
it
was
banished
from
her
presence
perhaps
for
ever
and
she
passed
the
time
in
weeping
which
according
to
her
auntâ€™s
direction
she
ought
to
have
employed
in
dressing
this
important
duty
was
however
quickly
dispatched
though
when
she
joined
madame
cheron
at
table
her
eyes
betrayed
that
she
had
been
in
tears
and
drew
upon
her
a
severe
reproof
her
efforts
to
appear
cheerful
did
not
entirely
fail
when
she
joined
the
company
at
the
house
of
madame
clairval
an
elderly
widow
lady
who
had
lately
come
to
reside
at
thoulouse
on
an
estate
of
her
late
husband
she
had
lived
many
years
at
paris
in
a
splendid
style
had
naturally
a
gay
temper
and
since
her
residence
at
thoulouse
had
given
some
of
the
most
magnificent
entertainments
that
had
been
seen
in
that
neighbourhood
these
excited
not
only
the
envy
but
the
trifling
ambition
of
madame
cheron
who
since
she
could
not
rival
the
splendour
of
her
festivities
was
desirous
of
being
ranked
in
the
number
of
her
most
intimate
friends
for
this
purpose
she
paid
her
the
most
obsequious
attention
and
made
a
point
of
being
disengaged
whenever
she
received
an
invitation
from
madame
clairval
of
whom
she
talked
wherever
she
went
and
derived
much
self-consequence
from
impressing
a
belief
on
her
general
acquaintance
that
they
were
on
the
most
familiar
footing
the
entertainments
of
this
evening
consisted
of
a
ball
and
supper
it
was
a
fancy
ball
and
the
company
danced
in
groups
in
the
gardens
which
were
very
extensive
the
high
and
luxuriant
trees
under
which
the
groups
assembled
were
illuminated
with
a
profusion
of
lamps
disposed
with
taste
and
fancy
the
gay
and
various
dresses
of
the
company
some
of
whom
were
seated
on
the
turf
conversing
at
their
ease
observing
the
cotillons
taking
refreshments
and
sometimes
touching
sportively
a
guitar
the
gallant
manners
of
the
gentlemen
the
exquisitely
capricious
air
of
the
ladies
the
light
fantastic
steps
of
their
dances
the
musicians
with
the
lute
the
hautboy
and
the
tabor
seated
at
the
foot
of
an
elm
and
the
sylvan
scenery
of
woods
around
were
circumstances
that
unitedly
formed
a
characteristic
and
striking
picture
of
french
festivity
emily
surveyed
the
gaiety
of
the
scene
with
a
melancholy
kind
of
pleasure
and
her
emotion
may
be
imagined
when
as
she
stood
with
her
aunt
looking
at
one
of
the
groups
she
perceived
valancourt
saw
him
dancing
with
a
young
and
beautiful
lady
saw
him
conversing
with
her
with
a
mixture
of
attention
and
familiarity
such
as
she
had
seldom
observed
in
his
manner
she
turned
hastily
from
the
scene
and
attempted
to
draw
away
madame
cheron
who
was
conversing
with
signor
cavigni
and
neither
perceived
valancourt
nor
was
willing
to
be
interrupted
a
faintness
suddenly
came
over
emily
and
unable
to
support
herself
she
sat
down
on
a
turf
bank
beneath
the
trees
where
several
other
persons
were
seated
one
of
these
observing
the
extreme
paleness
of
her
countenance
enquired
if
she
was
ill
and
begged
she
would
allow
him
to
fetch
her
a
glass
of
water
for
which
politeness
she
thanked
him
but
did
not
accept
it
her
apprehension
lest
valancourt
should
observe
her
emotion
made
her
anxious
to
overcome
it
and
she
succeeded
so
far
as
to
recompose
her
countenance
madame
cheron
was
still
conversing
with
cavigni
and
the
count
bauvillers
who
had
addressed
emily
made
some
observations
upon
the
scene
to
which
she
answered
almost
unconsciously
for
her
mind
was
still
occupied
with
the
idea
of
valancourt
to
whom
it
was
with
extreme
uneasiness
that
she
remained
so
near
some
remarks
however
which
the
count
made
upon
the
dance
obliged
her
to
turn
her
eyes
towards
it
and
at
that
moment
valancourtâ€™s
met
hers
her
colour
faded
again
she
felt
that
she
was
relapsing
into
faintness
and
instantly
averted
her
looks
but
not
before
she
had
observed
the
altered
countenance
of
valancourt
on
perceiving
her
she
would
have
left
the
spot
immediately
had
she
not
been
conscious
that
this
conduct
would
have
shown
him
more
obviously
the
interest
he
held
in
her
heart
and
having
tried
to
attend
to
the
countâ€™s
conversation
and
to
join
in
it
she
at
length
recovered
her
spirits
but
when
he
made
some
observation
on
valancourtâ€™s
partner
the
fear
of
showing
that
she
was
interested
in
the
remark
would
have
betrayed
it
to
him
had
not
the
count
while
he
spoke
looked
towards
the
person
of
whom
he
was
speaking
â€œthe
ladyâ€
said
he
â€œdancing
with
that
young
chevalier
who
appears
to
be
accomplished
in
everything
but
in
dancing
is
ranked
among
the
beauties
of
thoulouse
she
is
handsome
and
her
fortune
will
be
very
large
i
hope
she
will
make
a
better
choice
in
a
partner
for
life
than
she
has
done
in
a
partner
for
the
dance
for
i
observe
he
has
just
put
the
set
into
great
confusion
he
does
nothing
but
commit
blunders
i
am
surprised
that
with
his
air
and
figure
he
has
not
taken
more
care
to
accomplish
himself
in
dancingâ€
emily
whose
heart
trembled
at
every
word
that
was
now
uttered
endeavoured
to
turn
the
conversation
from
valancourt
by
enquiring
the
name
of
the
lady
with
whom
he
danced
but
before
the
count
could
reply
the
dance
concluded
and
emily
perceiving
that
valancourt
was
coming
towards
her
rose
and
joined
madame
cheron
â€œhere
is
the
chevalier
valancourt
madamâ€
said
she
in
a
whisper
â€œpray
let
us
goâ€
her
aunt
immediately
moved
on
but
not
before
valancourt
had
reached
them
who
bowed
lowly
to
madame
cheron
and
with
an
earnest
and
dejected
look
to
emily
with
whom
notwithstanding
all
her
effort
an
air
of
more
than
common
reserve
prevailed
the
presence
of
madame
cheron
prevented
valancourt
from
remaining
and
he
passed
on
with
a
countenance
whose
melancholy
reproached
her
for
having
increased
it
emily
was
called
from
the
musing
fit
into
which
she
had
fallen
by
the
count
bauvillers
who
was
known
to
her
aunt
â€œi
have
your
pardon
to
beg
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
he
â€œfor
a
rudeness
which
you
will
readily
believe
was
quite
unintentional
i
did
not
know
that
the
chevalier
was
your
acquaintance
when
i
so
freely
criticised
his
dancingâ€
emily
blushed
and
smiled
and
madame
cheron
spared
her
the
difficulty
of
replying
â€œif
you
mean
the
person
who
has
just
passed
usâ€
said
she
â€œi
can
assure
you
he
is
no
acquaintance
of
either
mine
or
maâ€™amselle
st
aubertâ€™s
i
know
nothing
of
himâ€
â€œo
that
is
the
chevalier
valancourtâ€
said
cavigni
carelessly
and
looking
back
â€œyou
know
him
thenâ€
said
madame
cheron
â€œi
am
not
acquainted
with
himâ€
replied
cavigni
â€œyou
donâ€™t
know
then
the
reason
i
have
to
call
him
impertinentâ€”he
has
had
the
presumption
to
admire
my
nieceâ€
â€œif
every
man
deserves
the
title
of
impertinent
who
admires
maâ€™amselle
st
aubertâ€
replied
cavigni
â€œi
fear
there
are
a
great
many
impertinents
and
i
am
willing
to
acknowledge
myself
one
of
the
numberâ€
â€œo
signorâ€
said
madame
cheron
with
an
affected
smile
â€œi
perceive
you
have
learnt
the
art
of
complimenting
since
you
came
into
france
but
it
is
cruel
to
compliment
children
since
they
mistake
flattery
for
truthâ€
cavigni
turned
away
his
face
for
a
moment
and
then
said
with
a
studied
air
â€œwhom
then
are
we
to
compliment
madam
for
it
would
be
absurd
to
compliment
a
woman
of
refined
understanding
she
is
above
all
praiseâ€
as
he
finished
the
sentence
he
gave
emily
a
sly
look
and
the
smile
that
had
lurked
in
his
eye
stole
forth
she
perfectly
understood
it
and
blushed
for
madame
cheron
who
replied
â€œyou
are
perfectly
right
signor
no
woman
of
understanding
can
endure
complimentâ€
â€œi
have
heard
signor
montoni
sayâ€
rejoined
cavigni
â€œthat
he
never
knew
but
one
woman
who
deserved
itâ€
â€œwellâ€
exclaimed
madame
cheron
with
a
short
laugh
and
a
smile
of
unutterable
complacency
â€œand
who
could
she
beâ€
â€œoâ€
replied
cavigni
â€œit
is
impossible
to
mistake
her
for
certainly
there
is
not
more
than
one
woman
in
the
world
who
has
both
the
merit
to
deserve
compliment
and
the
wit
to
refuse
it
most
women
reverse
the
case
entirelyâ€
he
looked
again
at
emily
who
blushed
deeper
than
before
for
her
aunt
and
turned
from
him
with
displeasure
â€œwell
signorâ€
said
madame
cheron
â€œi
protest
you
are
a
frenchman
i
never
heard
a
foreigner
say
anything
half
so
gallant
as
thatâ€
â€œtrue
madamâ€
said
the
count
who
had
been
some
time
silent
and
with
a
low
bow
â€œbut
the
gallantry
of
the
compliment
had
been
utterly
lost
but
for
the
ingenuity
that
discovered
the
applicationâ€
madame
cheron
did
not
perceive
the
meaning
of
this
too
satirical
sentence
and
she
therefore
escaped
the
pain
which
emily
felt
on
her
account
â€œo
here
comes
signor
montoni
himselfâ€
said
her
aunt
â€œi
protest
i
will
tell
him
all
the
fine
things
you
have
been
saying
to
meâ€
the
signor
however
passed
at
this
moment
into
another
walk
â€œpray
who
is
it
that
has
so
much
engaged
your
friend
this
eveningâ€
asked
madame
cheron
with
an
air
of
chagrin
â€œi
have
not
seen
him
onceâ€
â€œhe
had
a
very
particular
engagement
with
the
marquis
la
riviã¨reâ€
replied
cavigni
â€œwhich
has
detained
him
i
perceive
till
this
moment
or
he
would
have
done
himself
the
honour
of
paying
his
respects
to
you
madam
sooner
as
he
commissioned
me
to
say
but
i
know
not
how
it
isâ€”your
conversation
is
so
fascinatingâ€”that
it
can
charm
even
memory
i
think
or
i
should
certainly
have
delivered
my
friendâ€™s
apology
beforeâ€
â€œthe
apology
sir
would
have
been
more
satisfactory
from
himselfâ€
said
madame
cheron
whose
vanity
was
more
mortified
by
montoniâ€™s
neglect
than
flattered
by
cavigniâ€™s
compliment
her
manner
at
this
moment
and
cavigniâ€™s
late
conversation
now
awakened
a
suspicion
in
emilyâ€™s
mind
which
notwithstanding
that
some
recollections
served
to
confirm
it
appeared
preposterous
she
thought
she
perceived
that
montoni
was
paying
serious
addresses
to
her
aunt
and
that
she
not
only
accepted
them
but
was
jealously
watchful
of
any
appearance
of
neglect
on
his
partâ€”that
madame
cheron
at
her
years
should
elect
a
second
husband
was
ridiculous
though
her
vanity
made
it
not
impossible
but
that
montoni
with
his
discernment
his
figure
and
pretensions
should
make
a
choice
of
madame
cheronâ€”appeared
most
wonderful
her
thoughts
however
did
not
dwell
long
on
the
subject
nearer
interests
pressed
upon
them
valancourt
rejected
of
her
aunt
and
valancourt
dancing
with
a
gay
and
beautiful
partner
alternately
tormented
her
mind
as
she
passed
along
the
gardens
she
looked
timidly
forward
half
fearing
and
half
hoping
that
he
might
appear
in
the
crowd
and
the
disappointment
she
felt
on
not
seeing
him
told
her
that
she
had
hoped
more
than
she
had
feared
montoni
soon
after
joined
the
party
he
muttered
over
some
short
speech
about
regret
for
having
been
so
long
detained
elsewhere
when
he
knew
he
should
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
madame
cheron
here
and
she
receiving
the
apology
with
the
air
of
a
pettish
girl
addressed
herself
entirely
to
cavigni
who
looked
archly
at
montoni
as
if
he
would
have
said
â€œi
will
not
triumph
over
you
too
much
i
will
have
the
goodness
to
bear
my
honours
meekly
but
look
sharp
signor
or
i
shall
certainly
run
away
with
your
prizeâ€
the
supper
was
served
in
different
pavilions
in
the
gardens
as
well
as
in
one
large
saloon
of
the
chã¢teau
and
with
more
of
taste
than
either
of
splendour
or
even
of
plenty
madame
cheron
and
her
party
supped
with
madame
clairval
in
the
saloon
and
emily
with
difficulty
disguised
her
emotion
when
she
saw
valancourt
placed
at
the
same
table
with
herself
there
madame
cheron
having
surveyed
him
with
high
displeasure
said
to
some
person
who
sat
next
to
her
â€œpray
who
is
that
young
manâ€
â€œit
is
the
chevalier
valancourtâ€
was
the
answer
â€œyes
i
am
not
ignorant
of
his
name
but
who
is
this
chevalier
valancourt
that
thus
intrudes
himself
at
this
tableâ€
the
attention
of
the
person
to
whom
she
spoke
was
called
off
before
she
received
a
second
reply
the
table
at
which
they
sat
was
very
long
and
valancourt
being
seated
with
his
partner
near
the
bottom
and
emily
near
the
top
the
distance
between
them
may
account
for
his
not
immediately
perceiving
her
she
avoided
looking
to
that
end
of
the
table
but
whenever
her
eyes
happened
to
glance
towards
it
she
observed
him
conversing
with
his
beautiful
companion
and
the
observation
did
not
contribute
to
restore
her
peace
any
more
than
the
accounts
she
heard
of
the
fortune
and
accomplishments
of
this
same
lady
madame
cheron
to
whom
these
remarks
were
sometimes
addressed
because
they
supported
topics
for
trivial
conversation
seemed
indefatigable
in
her
attempts
to
depreciate
valancourt
towards
whom
she
felt
all
the
petty
resentment
of
a
narrow
pride
â€œi
admire
the
ladyâ€
said
she
â€œbut
i
must
condemn
her
choice
of
a
partnerâ€
â€œoh
the
chevalier
valancourt
is
one
of
the
most
accomplished
young
men
we
haveâ€
replied
the
lady
to
whom
this
remark
was
addressed
â€œit
is
whispered
that
mademoiselle
dâ€™emery
and
her
large
fortune
are
to
be
hisâ€
â€œimpossibleâ€
exclaimed
madame
cheron
reddening
with
vexation
â€œit
is
impossible
that
she
can
be
so
destitute
of
taste
he
has
so
little
the
air
of
a
person
of
condition
that
if
i
did
not
see
him
at
the
table
of
madame
clairval
i
should
never
have
suspected
him
to
be
one
i
have
besides
particular
reasons
for
believing
the
report
to
be
erroneousâ€
â€œi
cannot
doubt
the
truth
of
itâ€
replied
the
lady
gravely
disgusted
by
the
abrupt
contradiction
she
had
received
concerning
her
opinion
of
valancourtâ€™s
merit
â€œyou
will
perhaps
doubt
itâ€
said
madame
cheron
â€œwhen
i
assure
you
that
it
was
only
this
morning
that
i
rejected
his
suitâ€
this
was
said
without
any
intention
of
imposing
the
meaning
it
conveyed
but
simply
from
a
habit
of
considering
herself
to
be
the
most
important
person
in
every
affair
that
concerned
her
niece
and
because
literally
she
had
rejected
valancourt
â€œyour
reasons
are
indeed
such
as
cannot
be
doubtedâ€
replied
the
lady
with
an
ironical
smile
â€œany
more
than
the
discernment
of
the
chevalier
valancourtâ€
added
cavigni
who
stood
by
the
chair
of
madame
cheron
and
had
heard
her
arrogate
to
herself
as
he
thought
a
distinction
which
had
been
paid
to
her
niece
â€œhis
discernment
may
be
justly
questioned
signorâ€
said
madame
cheron
who
was
not
flattered
by
what
she
understood
to
be
an
encomium
on
emily
â€œalasâ€
exclaimed
cavigni
surveying
madame
cheron
with
affected
ecstasy
â€œhow
vain
is
that
assertion
while
that
faceâ€”that
shapeâ€”that
airâ€”combine
to
refute
it
unhappy
valancourt
his
discernment
has
been
his
destructionâ€
emily
looked
surprised
and
embarrassed
the
lady
who
had
lately
spoken
astonished
and
madame
cheron
who
though
she
did
not
perfectly
understand
this
speech
was
very
ready
to
believe
herself
complimented
by
it
said
smilingly
â€œo
signor
you
are
very
gallant
but
those
who
hear
you
vindicate
the
chevalierâ€™s
discernment
will
suppose
that
i
am
the
object
of
itâ€
â€œthey
cannot
doubt
itâ€
replied
cavigni
bowing
low
â€œand
would
not
that
be
very
mortifying
signorâ€
â€œunquestionably
it
wouldâ€
said
cavigni
â€œi
cannot
endure
the
thoughtâ€
said
madame
cheron
â€œit
is
not
to
be
enduredâ€
replied
cavigni
â€œwhat
can
be
done
to
prevent
so
humiliating
a
mistakeâ€
rejoined
madame
cheron
â€œalas
i
cannot
assist
youâ€
replied
cavigni
with
a
deliberating
air
â€œyour
only
chance
of
refuting
the
calumny
and
of
making
people
understand
what
you
wish
them
to
believe
is
to
persist
in
your
first
assertion
for
when
they
are
told
of
the
chevalierâ€™s
want
of
discernment
it
is
possible
they
may
suppose
he
never
presumed
to
distress
you
with
his
admirationâ€”but
then
againâ€”that
diffidence
which
renders
you
so
insensible
to
your
own
perfectionsâ€”they
will
consider
this
and
valancourtâ€™s
taste
will
not
be
doubted
though
you
arraign
it
in
short
they
will
in
spite
of
your
endeavours
continue
to
believe
what
might
very
naturally
have
occurred
to
them
without
any
hint
of
mineâ€”that
the
chevalier
has
taste
enough
to
admire
a
beautiful
womanâ€
â€œall
this
is
very
distressingâ€
said
madame
cheron
with
a
profound
sigh
â€œmay
i
be
allowed
to
ask
what
is
so
distressingâ€
said
madame
clairval
who
was
struck
with
the
rueful
countenance
and
doleful
accent
with
which
this
was
delivered
â€œit
is
a
delicate
subjectâ€
replied
madame
cheron
â€œa
very
mortifying
one
to
meâ€
â€œi
am
concerned
to
hear
itâ€
said
madame
clairval
â€œi
hope
nothing
has
occurred
this
evening
particularly
to
distress
youâ€
â€œalas
yes
within
this
half
hour
and
i
know
not
where
the
report
may
endâ€”my
pride
was
never
so
shocked
before
but
i
assure
you
the
report
is
totally
void
of
foundationâ€
â€œgood
godâ€
exclaimed
madame
clairval
â€œwhat
can
be
done
can
you
point
out
any
way
by
which
i
can
assist
or
console
youâ€
â€œthe
only
way
by
which
you
can
do
eitherâ€
replied
madame
cheron
â€œis
to
contradict
the
report
wherever
you
goâ€
â€œwell
but
pray
inform
me
what
i
am
to
contradictâ€
â€œit
is
so
very
humiliating
that
i
know
not
how
to
mention
itâ€
continued
madame
cheron
â€œbut
you
shall
judge
do
you
observe
that
young
man
seated
near
the
bottom
of
the
table
who
is
conversing
with
mademoiselle
dâ€™emeryâ€
â€œyes
i
perceive
whom
you
meanâ€
â€œyou
observe
how
little
he
has
the
air
of
a
person
of
condition
i
was
saying
just
now
that
i
should
not
have
thought
him
a
gentleman
if
i
had
not
seen
him
at
this
tableâ€
â€œwell
but
the
reportâ€
said
madame
clairval
â€œlet
me
understand
the
subject
of
your
distressâ€
â€œah
the
subject
of
my
distressâ€
replied
madame
cheron
â€œthis
person
whom
nobody
knowsâ€”i
beg
pardon
madam
i
did
not
consider
what
i
saidâ€”this
impertinent
young
man
having
had
the
presumption
to
address
my
niece
has
i
fear
given
rise
to
a
report
that
he
had
declared
himself
my
admirer
now
only
consider
how
very
mortifying
such
a
report
must
be
you
i
know
will
feel
for
my
situation
a
woman
of
my
conditionâ€”think
how
degrading
even
the
rumour
of
such
an
alliance
must
beâ€
â€œdegrading
indeed
my
poor
friendâ€
said
madame
clairval
â€œyou
may
rely
upon
it
i
will
contradict
the
report
wherever
i
goâ€
as
she
said
which
she
turned
her
attention
upon
another
part
of
the
company
and
cavigni
who
had
hitherto
appeared
a
grave
spectator
of
the
scene
now
fearing
he
should
be
unable
to
smother
the
laugh
that
convulsed
him
walked
abruptly
away
â€œi
perceive
you
do
not
knowâ€
said
the
lady
who
sat
near
madame
cheron
â€œthat
the
gentleman
you
have
been
speaking
of
is
madame
clairvalâ€™s
nephewâ€
â€œimpossibleâ€
exclaimed
madame
cheron
who
now
began
to
perceive
that
she
had
been
totally
mistaken
in
her
judgment
of
valancourt
and
to
praise
him
aloud
with
as
much
servility
as
she
had
before
censured
him
with
frivolous
malignity
emily
who
during
the
greater
part
of
this
conversation
had
been
so
absorbed
in
thought
as
to
be
spared
the
pain
of
hearing
it
was
now
extremely
surprised
by
her
auntâ€™s
praise
of
valancourt
with
whose
relationship
to
madame
clairval
she
was
unacquainted
but
she
was
not
sorry
when
madame
cheron
who
though
she
now
tried
to
appear
unconcerned
was
really
much
embarrassed
prepared
to
withdraw
immediately
after
supper
montoni
then
came
to
hand
madame
cheron
to
her
carriage
and
cavigni
with
an
arch
solemnity
of
countenance
followed
with
emily
who
as
she
wished
them
good
night
and
drew
up
the
glass
saw
valancourt
among
the
crowd
at
the
gates
before
the
carriage
drove
off
he
disappeared
madame
cheron
forbore
to
mention
him
to
emily
and
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
chã¢teau
they
separated
for
the
night
on
the
following
morning
as
emily
sat
at
breakfast
with
her
aunt
a
letter
was
brought
to
her
of
which
she
knew
the
handwriting
upon
the
cover
and
as
she
received
it
with
a
trembling
hand
madame
cheron
hastily
enquired
from
whom
it
came
emily
with
her
leave
broke
the
seal
and
observing
the
signature
of
valancourt
gave
it
unread
to
her
aunt
who
received
it
with
impatience
and
as
she
looked
it
over
emily
endeavoured
to
read
on
her
countenance
its
contents
having
returned
the
letter
to
her
niece
whose
eyes
asked
if
she
might
examine
it
â€œyes
read
it
childâ€
said
madame
cheron
in
a
manner
less
severe
than
she
had
expected
and
emily
had
perhaps
never
before
so
willingly
obeyed
her
aunt
in
this
letter
valancourt
said
little
of
the
interview
of
the
preceding
day
but
concluded
with
declaring
that
he
would
accept
his
dismission
from
emily
only
and
with
entreating
that
she
would
allow
him
to
wait
upon
her
on
the
approaching
evening
when
she
read
this
she
was
astonished
at
the
moderation
of
madame
cheron
and
looked
at
her
with
timid
expectation
as
she
said
sorrowfullyâ€”â€œwhat
am
i
to
say
madamâ€
â€œwhyâ€”we
must
see
the
young
man
i
believeâ€
replied
her
aunt
â€œand
hear
what
he
has
further
to
say
for
himself
you
may
tell
him
he
may
comeâ€
emily
dared
scarcely
credit
what
she
heard
â€œyet
stayâ€
added
madame
cheron
â€œi
will
tell
him
so
myselfâ€
she
called
for
pen
and
ink
emily
still
not
daring
to
trust
the
emotions
she
felt
and
almost
sinking
beneath
them
her
surprise
would
have
been
less
had
she
overheard
on
the
preceding
evening
what
madame
cheron
had
not
forgottenâ€”that
valancourt
was
the
nephew
of
madame
clairval
what
were
the
particulars
of
her
auntâ€™s
note
emily
did
not
learn
but
the
result
was
a
visit
from
valancourt
in
the
evening
whom
madame
cheron
received
alone
and
they
had
a
long
conversation
before
emily
was
called
down
when
she
entered
the
room
her
aunt
was
conversing
with
complacency
and
she
saw
the
eyes
of
valancourt
as
he
impatiently
rose
animated
with
hope
â€œwe
have
been
talking
over
this
affairâ€
said
madame
cheron
â€œthe
chevalier
has
been
telling
me
that
the
late
monsieur
clairval
was
the
brother
of
the
countess
de
duvarney
his
mother
i
only
wish
he
had
mentioned
his
relationship
to
madame
clairval
before
i
certainly
should
have
considered
that
circumstance
as
a
sufficient
introduction
to
my
houseâ€
valancourt
bowed
and
was
going
to
address
emily
but
her
aunt
prevented
him
â€œi
have
therefore
consented
that
you
shall
receive
his
visits
and
though
i
will
not
bind
myself
by
any
promise
or
say
that
i
shall
consider
him
as
my
nephew
yet
i
shall
permit
the
intercourse
and
shall
look
forward
to
any
further
connection
as
an
event
which
may
possibly
take
place
in
a
course
of
years
provided
the
chevalier
rises
in
his
profession
or
any
circumstance
occurs
which
may
make
it
prudent
for
him
to
take
a
wife
but
mons
valancourt
will
observe
and
you
too
emily
that
till
that
happens
i
positively
forbid
any
thoughts
of
marryingâ€
emilyâ€™s
countenance
during
this
coarse
speech
varied
every
instant
and
towards
its
conclusion
her
distress
had
so
much
increased
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room
valancourt
meanwhile
scarcely
less
embarrassed
did
not
dare
to
look
at
her
for
whom
he
was
thus
distressed
but
when
madame
cheron
was
silent
he
said
â€œflattering
madam
as
your
approbation
is
to
meâ€”highly
as
i
am
honoured
by
itâ€”i
have
yet
so
much
to
fear
that
i
scarcely
dare
to
hopeâ€
â€œpray
sir
explain
yourselfâ€
said
madame
cheron
an
unexpected
requisition
which
embarrassed
valancourt
again
and
almost
overcame
him
with
confusion
at
circumstances
on
which
had
he
been
only
a
spectator
of
the
scene
he
would
have
smiled
â€œtill
i
receive
mademoiselle
st
aubertâ€™s
permission
to
accept
your
indulgenceâ€
said
he
falteringlyâ€”â€œtill
she
allows
me
to
hopeâ€”â€
â€œo
is
that
allâ€
interrupted
madame
cheron
â€œwell
i
will
take
upon
me
to
answer
for
her
but
at
the
same
time
sir
give
me
leave
to
observe
to
you
that
i
am
her
guardian
and
that
i
expect
in
every
instance
that
my
will
is
hersâ€
as
she
said
this
she
rose
and
quitted
the
room
leaving
emily
and
valancourt
in
a
state
of
mutual
embarrassment
and
when
valancourtâ€™s
hopes
enabled
him
to
overcome
his
fears
and
to
address
her
with
the
zeal
and
sincerity
so
natural
to
him
it
was
a
considerable
time
before
she
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
hear
with
distinctness
his
solicitations
and
inquiries
the
conduct
of
madame
cheron
in
this
affair
had
been
entirely
governed
by
selfish
vanity
valancourt
in
his
first
interview
had
with
great
candour
laid
open
to
her
the
true
state
of
his
present
circumstances
and
his
future
expectancies
and
she
with
more
prudence
than
humanity
had
absolutely
and
abruptly
rejected
his
suit
she
wished
her
niece
to
marry
ambitiously
not
because
she
desired
to
see
her
in
possession
of
the
happiness
which
rank
and
wealth
are
usually
believed
to
bestow
but
because
she
desired
to
partake
the
importance
which
such
an
alliance
would
give
when
therefore
she
discovered
that
valancourt
was
the
nephew
of
a
person
of
so
much
consequence
as
madame
clairval
she
became
anxious
for
the
connection
since
the
prospect
it
afforded
of
future
fortune
and
distinction
for
emily
promised
the
exaltation
she
coveted
for
herself
her
calculations
concerning
fortune
in
this
alliance
were
guided
rather
by
her
wishes
than
by
any
hint
of
valancourt
or
strong
appearance
of
probability
and
when
she
rested
her
expectation
on
the
wealth
of
madame
clairval
she
seemed
totally
to
have
forgotten
that
the
latter
had
a
daughter
valancourt
however
had
not
forgotten
this
circumstance
and
the
consideration
of
it
had
made
him
so
modest
in
his
expectations
from
madame
clairval
that
he
had
not
even
named
the
relationship
in
his
first
conversation
with
madame
cheron
but
whatever
might
be
the
future
fortune
of
emily
the
present
distinction
which
the
connection
would
afford
for
herself
was
certain
since
the
splendour
of
madame
clairvalâ€™s
establishment
was
such
as
to
excite
the
general
envy
and
partial
imitation
of
the
neighbourhood
thus
had
she
consented
to
involve
her
niece
in
an
engagement
to
which
she
saw
only
a
distant
and
uncertain
conclusion
with
as
little
consideration
of
her
happiness
as
when
she
had
so
precipitately
forbade
it
for
though
she
herself
possessed
the
means
of
rendering
this
union
not
only
certain
but
prudent
yet
to
do
so
was
no
part
of
her
present
intention
from
this
period
valancourt
made
frequent
visits
to
madame
cheron
and
emily
passed
in
his
society
the
happiest
hours
she
had
known
since
the
death
of
her
father
they
were
both
too
much
engaged
by
the
present
moments
to
give
serious
consideration
to
the
future
they
loved
and
were
beloved
and
saw
not
that
the
very
attachment
which
formed
the
delight
of
their
present
days
might
possibly
occasion
the
sufferings
of
years
meanwhile
madame
cheronâ€™s
intercourse
with
madame
clairval
became
more
frequent
than
before
and
her
vanity
was
already
gratified
by
the
opportunity
of
proclaiming
wherever
she
went
the
attachment
that
subsisted
between
their
nephew
and
niece
montoni
was
now
also
become
a
daily
guest
at
the
chã¢teau
and
emily
was
compelled
to
observe
that
he
really
was
a
suitor
and
a
favoured
suitor
to
her
aunt
thus
passed
the
winter
months
not
only
in
peace
but
in
happiness
to
valancourt
and
emily
the
station
of
his
regiment
being
so
near
thoulouse
as
to
allow
this
frequent
intercourse
the
pavilion
on
the
terrace
was
the
favourite
scene
of
their
interviews
and
there
emily
with
madame
cheron
would
work
while
valancourt
read
aloud
works
of
genius
and
taste
listened
to
her
enthusiasm
expressed
his
own
and
caught
new
opportunities
of
observing
that
their
minds
were
formed
to
constitute
the
happiness
of
each
other
the
same
taste
the
same
noble
and
benevolent
sentiments
animating
each
as
when
a
shepherd
of
the
hebrid-isles
placed
far
amid
the
melancholy
main
whether
it
be
lone
fancy
him
beguiles
or
that
aerial
beings
sometimes
deign
to
stand
embodied
to
our
senses
plain
sees
on
the
naked
hill
or
valley
low
the
whilst
in
ocean
phå“bus
dips
his
wain
a
vast
assembly
moving
to
and
fro
then
all
at
once
in
air
dissolves
the
wondrous
show
castle
of
indolence
madame
cheronâ€™s
avarice
at
length
yielded
to
her
vanity
some
very
splendid
entertainments
which
madame
clairval
had
given
and
the
general
adulation
which
was
paid
her
made
the
former
more
anxious
than
before
to
secure
an
alliance
that
would
so
much
exalt
her
in
her
own
opinion
and
in
that
of
the
world
she
proposed
terms
for
the
immediate
marriage
of
her
niece
and
offered
to
give
emily
a
dower
provided
madame
clairval
observed
equal
terms
on
the
part
of
her
nephew
madame
clairval
listened
to
the
proposal
and
considering
that
emily
was
the
apparent
heiress
of
her
auntâ€™s
wealth
accepted
it
meanwhile
emily
knew
nothing
of
the
transaction
till
madame
cheron
informed
her
that
she
must
make
preparation
for
the
nuptials
which
would
be
celebrated
without
further
delay
then
astonished
and
wholly
unable
to
account
for
this
sudden
conclusion
which
valancourt
had
not
solicited
for
he
was
ignorant
of
what
had
passed
between
the
elder
ladies
and
had
not
dared
to
hope
such
good
fortune
she
decisively
objected
to
it
madame
cheron
however
quite
as
jealous
of
contradiction
now
as
she
had
been
formerly
contended
for
a
speedy
marriage
with
as
much
vehemence
as
she
had
formerly
opposed
whatever
had
the
most
remote
possibility
of
leading
to
it
and
emilyâ€™s
scruples
disappeared
when
she
again
saw
valancourt
who
was
now
informed
of
the
happiness
designed
for
him
and
came
to
claim
a
promise
of
it
from
herself
while
preparations
were
making
for
these
nuptials
montoni
became
the
acknowledged
lover
of
madame
cheron
and
though
madame
clairval
was
much
displeased
when
she
heard
of
the
approaching
connection
and
was
willing
to
prevent
that
of
valancourt
with
emily
her
conscience
told
her
that
she
had
no
right
thus
to
trifle
with
their
peace
and
madame
clairval
though
a
woman
of
fashion
was
far
less
advanced
than
her
friend
in
the
art
of
deriving
satisfaction
from
distinction
and
admiration
rather
than
from
conscience
emily
observed
with
concern
the
ascendancy
which
montoni
had
acquired
over
madame
cheron
as
well
as
the
increasing
frequency
of
his
visits
and
her
own
opinion
of
this
italian
was
confirmed
by
that
of
valancourt
who
had
always
expressed
a
dislike
of
him
as
she
was
one
morning
sitting
at
work
in
the
pavilion
enjoying
the
pleasant
freshness
of
spring
whose
colours
were
now
spread
upon
the
landscape
and
listening
to
valancourt
who
was
reading
but
who
often
laid
aside
the
book
to
converse
she
received
a
summons
to
attend
madame
cheron
immediately
and
had
scarcely
entered
the
dressing-room
when
she
observed
with
surprise
the
dejection
of
her
auntâ€™s
countenance
and
the
contrasted
gaiety
of
her
dress
â€œso
nieceâ€â€”said
madame
and
she
stopped
under
some
degree
of
embarrassmentâ€”â€œi
sent
for
youâ€”iâ€”i
wished
to
see
you
i
have
news
to
tell
you
from
this
hour
you
must
consider
the
signor
montoni
as
your
uncleâ€”we
were
married
this
morningâ€
astonishedâ€”not
so
much
at
the
marriage
as
at
the
secrecy
with
which
it
had
been
concluded
and
the
agitation
with
which
it
was
announced
emily
at
length
attributed
the
privacy
to
the
wish
of
montoni
rather
than
of
her
aunt
his
wife
however
intended
that
the
contrary
should
be
believed
and
therefore
added
â€œyou
see
i
wished
to
avoid
a
bustle
but
now
the
ceremony
is
over
i
shall
do
so
no
longer
and
i
wish
to
announce
to
my
servants
that
they
must
receive
the
signor
montoni
for
their
masterâ€
emily
made
a
feeble
attempt
to
congratulate
her
on
these
apparently
imprudent
nuptials
â€œi
shall
now
celebrate
my
marriage
with
some
splendourâ€
continued
madame
montoni
â€œand
to
save
time
i
shall
avail
myself
of
the
preparation
that
has
been
made
for
yours
which
will
of
course
be
delayed
a
little
while
such
of
your
wedding
clothes
as
are
ready
i
shall
expect
you
will
appear
in
to
do
honour
to
this
festival
i
also
wish
you
to
inform
monsieur
valancourt
that
i
have
changed
my
name
and
he
will
acquaint
madame
clairval
in
a
few
days
i
shall
give
a
grand
entertainment
at
which
i
shall
request
their
presenceâ€
emily
was
so
lost
in
surprise
and
various
thought
that
she
made
madame
montoni
scarcely
any
reply
but
at
her
desire
she
returned
to
inform
valancourt
of
what
had
passed
surprise
was
not
his
predominant
emotion
on
hearing
of
these
hasty
nuptials
and
when
he
learned
that
they
were
to
be
the
means
of
delaying
his
own
and
that
the
very
ornaments
of
the
chã¢teau
which
had
been
prepared
to
grace
the
nuptial
day
of
his
emily
were
to
be
degraded
to
the
celebration
of
madame
montoniâ€™s
grief
and
indignation
agitated
him
alternately
he
could
conceal
neither
from
the
observation
of
emily
whose
efforts
to
abstract
him
from
these
serious
emotions
and
to
laugh
at
the
apprehensive
considerations
that
assailed
him
were
ineffectual
and
when
at
length
he
took
leave
there
was
an
earnest
tenderness
in
his
manner
that
extremely
affected
her
she
even
shed
tears
when
he
disappeared
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
yet
knew
not
exactly
why
she
should
do
so
montoni
now
took
possession
of
the
chã¢teau
and
the
command
of
its
inhabitants
with
the
ease
of
a
man
who
had
long
considered
it
to
be
his
own
his
friend
cavigni
who
had
been
extremely
serviceable
in
having
paid
madame
cheron
the
attention
and
flattery
which
she
required
but
from
which
montoni
too
often
revolted
had
apartments
assigned
to
him
and
received
from
the
domestics
an
equal
degree
of
obedience
with
the
master
of
the
mansion
within
a
few
days
madame
montoni
as
she
had
promised
gave
a
magnificent
entertainment
to
a
very
numerous
company
among
whom
was
valancourt
but
at
which
madame
clairval
excused
herself
from
attending
there
was
a
concert
ball
and
supper
valancourt
was
of
course
emilyâ€™s
partner
and
though
when
he
gave
a
look
to
the
decorations
of
the
apartments
he
could
not
but
remember
that
they
were
designed
for
other
festivities
than
those
they
now
contributed
to
celebrate
he
endeavoured
to
check
his
concern
by
considering
that
a
little
while
only
would
elapse
before
they
would
be
given
to
their
original
destination
during
this
evening
madame
montoni
danced
laughed
and
talked
incessantly
while
montoni
silent
reserved
and
somewhat
haughty
seemed
weary
of
the
parade
and
of
the
frivolous
company
it
had
drawn
together
this
was
the
first
and
the
last
entertainment
given
in
celebration
of
their
nuptials
montoni
though
the
severity
of
his
temper
and
the
gloominess
of
his
pride
prevented
him
from
enjoying
such
festivities
was
extremely
willing
to
promote
them
it
was
seldom
that
he
could
meet
in
any
company
a
man
of
more
address
and
still
seldomer
one
of
more
understanding
than
himself
the
balance
of
advantage
in
such
parties
or
in
the
connections
which
might
arise
from
them
must
therefore
be
on
his
side
and
knowing
as
he
did
the
selfish
purposes
for
which
they
are
generally
frequented
he
had
no
objection
to
measure
his
talents
of
dissimulation
with
those
of
any
other
competitor
for
distinction
and
plunder
but
his
wife
who
when
her
own
interest
was
immediately
concerned
had
sometimes
more
discernment
than
vanity
acquired
a
consciousness
of
her
inferiority
to
other
women
in
personal
attractions
which
uniting
with
the
jealousy
natural
to
the
discovery
counteracted
his
readiness
for
mingling
with
all
the
parties
thoulouse
could
afford
till
she
had
as
she
supposed
the
affections
of
a
husband
to
lose
she
had
no
motive
for
discovering
the
unwelcome
truth
and
it
had
never
obtruded
itself
upon
her
but
now
that
it
influenced
her
policy
she
opposed
her
husbandâ€™s
inclination
for
company
with
the
more
eagerness
because
she
believed
him
to
be
really
as
well
received
in
the
female
society
of
the
place
as
during
his
addresses
to
her
he
had
affected
to
be
a
few
weeks
only
had
elapsed
since
the
marriage
when
madame
montoni
informed
emily
that
the
signor
intended
to
return
to
italy
as
soon
as
the
necessary
preparation
could
be
made
for
so
long
a
journey
â€œwe
shall
go
to
veniceâ€
said
she
â€œwhere
the
signor
has
a
fine
mansion
and
from
thence
to
his
estate
in
tuscany
why
do
you
look
so
grave
childâ€”you
who
are
so
fond
of
a
romantic
country
and
fine
views
will
doubtless
be
delighted
with
this
journeyâ€
â€œam
i
then
to
be
of
the
party
madamâ€
said
emily
with
extreme
surprise
and
emotion
â€œmost
certainlyâ€
replied
her
aunt
â€œhow
could
you
imagine
we
should
leave
you
behind
but
i
see
you
are
thinking
of
the
chevalier
he
is
not
yet
i
believe
informed
of
the
journey
but
he
very
soon
will
be
so
signor
montoni
is
gone
to
acquaint
madame
clairval
of
our
journey
and
to
say
that
the
proposed
connection
between
the
families
must
from
this
time
be
thought
of
no
moreâ€
the
unfeeling
manner
in
which
madame
montoni
thus
informed
her
niece
that
she
must
be
separated
perhaps
for
ever
from
the
man
with
whom
she
was
on
the
point
of
being
united
for
life
added
to
the
dismay
which
she
must
otherwise
have
suffered
at
such
intelligence
when
she
could
speak
she
asked
the
cause
of
the
sudden
change
in
madameâ€™s
sentiments
towards
valancourt
but
the
only
reply
she
could
obtain
was
that
the
signor
had
forbade
the
connection
considering
it
to
be
greatly
inferior
to
what
emily
might
reasonably
expect
â€œi
now
leave
the
affair
entirely
to
the
signorâ€
added
madame
montoni
â€œbut
i
must
say
that
m
valancourt
never
was
a
favourite
with
me
and
i
was
overpersuaded
or
i
should
not
have
given
my
consent
to
the
connection
i
was
weak
enoughâ€”i
am
so
foolish
sometimesâ€”to
suffer
other
peopleâ€™s
uneasiness
to
affect
me
and
so
my
better
judgment
yielded
to
your
affliction
but
the
signor
has
very
properly
pointed
out
the
folly
of
this
and
he
shall
not
have
to
reprove
me
a
second
time
i
am
determined
that
you
shall
submit
to
those
who
know
how
to
guide
you
better
than
yourselfâ€”i
am
determined
that
you
shall
be
conformableâ€
emily
would
have
been
astonished
at
the
assertions
of
this
eloquent
speech
had
not
her
mind
been
so
overwhelmed
by
the
sudden
shock
it
had
received
that
she
scarcely
heard
a
word
of
what
was
latterly
addressed
to
her
whatever
were
the
weaknesses
of
madame
montoni
she
might
have
avoided
to
accuse
herself
with
those
of
compassion
and
tenderness
to
the
feelings
of
others
and
especially
to
those
of
emily
it
was
the
same
ambition
that
lately
prevailed
upon
her
to
solicit
an
alliance
with
madame
clairvalâ€™s
family
which
induced
her
to
withdraw
from
it
now
that
her
marriage
with
montoni
had
exalted
her
self-consequence
and
with
it
her
views
for
her
niece
emily
was
at
this
time
too
much
affected
to
employ
either
remonstrance
or
entreaty
on
this
topic
and
when
at
length
she
attempted
the
latter
her
emotion
overcame
her
speech
and
she
retired
to
her
apartment
to
think
if
in
the
present
state
of
her
mind
to
think
was
possible
upon
this
sudden
and
overwhelming
subject
it
was
very
long
before
her
spirits
were
sufficiently
composed
to
permit
the
reflection
which
when
it
came
was
dark
and
even
terrible
she
saw
that
montoni
sought
to
aggrandise
himself
in
his
disposal
of
her
and
it
occurred
that
his
friend
cavigni
was
the
person
for
whom
he
was
interested
the
prospect
of
going
to
italy
was
still
rendered
darker
when
she
considered
the
tumultuous
situation
of
that
country
then
torn
by
civil
commotion
where
every
petty
state
was
at
war
with
its
neighbour
and
even
every
castle
liable
to
the
attack
of
an
invader
she
considered
the
person
to
whose
immediate
guidance
she
would
be
committed
and
the
vast
distance
that
was
to
separate
her
from
valancourt
and
at
the
recollection
of
him
every
other
image
vanished
from
her
mind
and
every
thought
was
again
obscured
by
grief
in
this
perturbed
state
she
passed
some
hours
and
when
she
was
summoned
to
dinner
she
entreated
permission
to
remain
in
her
own
apartment
but
madame
montoni
was
alone
and
the
request
was
refused
emily
and
her
aunt
said
little
during
the
repast
the
one
occupied
by
her
griefs
the
other
engrossed
by
the
disappointment
which
the
unexpected
absence
of
montoni
occasioned
for
not
only
was
her
vanity
piqued
by
the
neglect
but
her
jealousy
alarmed
by
what
she
considered
as
a
mysterious
engagement
when
the
cloth
was
drawn
and
they
were
alone
emily
renewed
the
mention
of
valancourt
but
her
aunt
neither
softened
to
pity
nor
awakened
to
remorse
became
enraged
that
her
will
should
be
opposed
and
the
authority
of
montoni
questioned
though
this
was
done
by
emily
with
her
usual
gentleness
who
after
a
long
and
torturing
conversation
retired
in
tears
as
she
crossed
the
hall
a
person
entered
it
by
the
great
door
whom
as
her
eyes
hastily
glanced
that
way
she
imagined
to
be
montoni
and
she
was
passing
on
with
quicker
steps
when
she
heard
the
well-known
voice
of
valancourt
â€œemily
o
my
emilyâ€
cried
he
in
a
tone
faltering
with
impatience
while
she
turned
and
as
he
advanced
was
alarmed
at
the
expression
of
his
countenance
and
the
eager
desperation
of
his
air
â€œin
tears
emily
i
would
speak
with
youâ€
said
he
â€œi
have
much
to
say
conduct
me
to
where
we
may
converse
but
you
trembleâ€”you
are
ill
let
me
lead
you
to
a
seatâ€
he
observed
the
open
door
of
an
apartment
and
hastily
took
her
hand
to
lead
her
thither
but
she
attempted
to
withdraw
it
and
said
with
a
languid
smile
â€œi
am
better
already
if
you
wish
to
see
my
aunt
she
is
in
the
dining-parlourâ€
â€œi
must
speak
with
you
my
emilyâ€
replied
valancourt
â€œgood
god
is
it
already
come
to
this
are
you
indeed
so
willing
to
resign
me
but
this
is
an
improper
placeâ€”i
am
overheard
let
me
entreat
your
attention
if
only
for
a
few
minutesâ€â€”â€œwhen
you
have
seen
my
auntâ€
said
emily
â€œi
was
wretched
enough
when
i
came
hitherâ€
exclaimed
valancourt
â€œdo
not
increase
my
misery
by
this
coldnessâ€”this
cruel
refusalâ€
the
despondency
with
which
he
spoke
this
affected
her
almost
to
tears
but
she
persisted
in
refusing
to
hear
him
till
he
had
conversed
with
madame
montoni
â€œwhere
is
her
husband
where
then
is
montoniâ€
said
valancourt
in
an
altered
tone
â€œit
is
he
to
whom
i
must
speakâ€
emily
terrified
for
the
consequence
of
the
indignation
that
flashed
in
his
eyes
tremblingly
assured
him
that
montoni
was
not
at
home
and
entreated
he
would
endeavour
to
moderate
his
resentment
at
the
tremulous
accents
of
her
voice
his
eyes
softened
instantly
from
wildness
into
tenderness
â€œyou
are
ill
emilyâ€
said
he
â€œthey
will
destroy
us
both
forgive
me
that
i
dared
to
doubt
your
affectionâ€
emily
no
longer
opposed
him
as
he
led
her
into
an
adjoining
parlour
the
manner
in
which
he
had
named
montoni
had
so
much
alarmed
her
for
his
own
safety
that
she
was
now
only
anxious
to
prevent
the
consequences
of
his
just
resentment
he
listened
to
her
entreaties
with
attention
but
replied
to
them
only
with
looks
of
despondency
and
tenderness
concealing
as
much
as
possible
the
sentiments
he
felt
towards
montoni
that
he
might
soothe
the
apprehensions
which
distressed
her
but
she
saw
the
veil
he
had
spread
over
his
resentment
and
his
assumed
tranquillity
only
alarming
her
more
she
urged
at
length
the
impolicy
of
forcing
an
interview
with
montoni
and
of
taking
any
measure
which
might
render
their
separation
irremediable
valancourt
yielded
to
these
remonstrances
and
her
affecting
entreaties
drew
from
him
a
promise
that
however
montoni
might
persist
in
his
design
of
disuniting
them
he
would
not
seek
to
redress
his
wrongs
by
violence
â€œfor
my
sakeâ€
said
emily
â€œlet
the
consideration
of
what
i
should
suffer
deter
you
from
such
a
mode
of
revengeâ€
â€œfor
your
sake
emilyâ€
replied
valancourt
his
eyes
filling
with
tears
of
tenderness
and
grief
while
he
gazed
upon
her
â€œyesâ€”yesâ€”i
shall
subdue
myself
but
though
i
have
given
you
my
solemn
promise
to
do
this
do
not
expect
that
i
can
tamely
submit
to
the
authority
of
montoni
if
i
could
i
should
be
unworthy
of
you
yet
o
emily
how
long
may
he
condemn
me
to
live
without
youâ€”how
long
may
it
be
before
you
return
to
franceâ€
emily
endeavoured
to
sooth
him
with
assurances
of
her
unalterable
affection
and
by
representing
that
in
little
more
than
a
year
she
should
be
her
own
mistress
as
far
as
related
to
her
aunt
from
whose
guardianship
her
age
would
then
release
her
assurances
which
gave
little
consolation
to
valancourt
who
considered
that
she
would
then
be
in
italy
and
in
the
power
of
those
whose
dominion
over
her
would
not
cease
with
their
rights
but
he
affected
to
be
consoled
by
them
emily
comforted
by
the
promise
she
had
obtained
and
by
his
apparent
composure
was
about
to
leave
him
when
her
aunt
entered
the
room
she
threw
a
glance
of
sharp
reproof
upon
her
niece
who
immediately
withdrew
and
of
haughty
displeasure
upon
valancourt
â€œthis
is
not
the
conduct
i
should
have
expected
from
you
sirâ€
said
she
â€œi
did
not
expect
to
see
you
in
my
house
after
you
had
been
informed
that
your
visits
were
no
longer
agreeable
much
less
that
you
would
seek
a
clandestine
interview
with
my
niece
and
that
she
would
grant
oneâ€
valancourt
perceiving
it
necessary
to
vindicate
emily
from
such
a
design
explained
that
the
purpose
of
his
own
visit
had
been
to
request
an
interview
with
montoni
and
he
then
entered
upon
the
subject
of
it
with
the
tempered
spirit
which
the
sex
rather
than
the
respectability
of
madame
montoni
demanded
his
expostulations
were
answered
with
severe
rebuke
she
lamented
again
that
her
prudence
had
ever
yielded
to
what
she
termed
compassion
and
added
that
she
was
so
sensible
of
the
folly
of
her
former
consent
that
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
a
repetition
she
had
committed
the
affair
entirely
to
the
conduct
of
signor
montoni
the
feeling
eloquence
of
valancourt
however
at
length
made
her
sensible
in
some
measure
of
her
unworthy
conduct
and
she
became
susceptible
to
shame
but
not
remorse
she
hated
valancourt
who
awakened
her
to
this
painful
sensation
and
in
proportion
as
she
grew
dissatisfied
with
herself
her
abhorrence
of
him
increased
this
was
also
the
more
inveterate
because
his
tempered
words
and
manner
were
such
as
without
accusing
her
compelled
her
to
accuse
herself
and
neither
left
her
a
hope
that
the
odious
portrait
was
the
caricature
of
his
prejudice
or
afforded
her
an
excuse
for
expressing
the
violent
resentment
with
which
she
contemplated
it
at
length
her
anger
rose
to
such
a
height
that
valancourt
was
compelled
to
leave
the
house
abruptly
lest
he
should
forfeit
his
own
esteem
by
an
intemperate
reply
he
was
then
convinced
that
from
madame
montoni
he
had
nothing
to
hope
for
what
of
either
pity
or
justice
could
be
expected
from
a
person
who
could
feel
the
pain
of
guilt
without
the
humility
of
repentance
to
montoni
he
looked
with
equal
despondency
since
it
was
nearly
evident
that
this
plan
of
separation
originated
with
him
and
it
was
not
probable
that
he
would
relinquish
his
own
views
to
entreaties
or
remonstrances
which
he
must
have
foreseen
and
have
been
prepared
to
resist
yet
remembering
his
promise
to
emily
and
more
solicitous
concerning
his
love
than
jealous
of
his
consequence
valancourt
was
careful
to
do
nothing
that
might
unnecessarily
irritate
montoni
he
wrote
to
him
therefore
not
to
demand
an
interview
but
to
solicit
one
and
having
done
this
he
endeavoured
to
wait
with
calmness
his
reply
madame
clairval
was
passive
in
the
affair
when
she
gave
her
approbation
to
valancourtâ€™s
marriage
it
was
in
the
belief
that
emily
would
be
the
heiress
of
madame
montoniâ€™s
fortune
and
though
upon
the
nuptials
of
the
latter
when
she
perceived
the
fallacy
of
this
expectation
her
conscience
had
withheld
her
from
adopting
any
measure
to
prevent
the
union
her
benevolence
was
not
sufficiently
active
to
impel
her
towards
any
step
that
might
now
promote
it
she
was
on
the
contrary
secretly
pleased
that
valancourt
was
released
from
an
engagement
which
she
considered
to
be
as
inferior
in
point
of
fortune
to
his
merit
as
his
alliance
was
thought
by
montoni
to
be
humiliating
to
the
beauty
of
emily
and
though
her
pride
was
wounded
by
this
rejection
of
a
member
of
her
family
she
disdained
to
show
resentment
otherwise
than
by
silence
montoni
in
his
reply
to
valancourt
said
that
as
an
interview
could
neither
remove
the
objections
of
the
one
nor
overcome
the
wishes
of
the
other
it
would
serve
only
to
produce
useless
altercation
between
them
he
therefore
thought
proper
to
refuse
it
in
consideration
of
the
policy
suggested
by
emily
and
of
his
promise
to
her
valancourt
restrained
the
impulse
that
urged
him
to
the
house
of
montoni
to
demand
what
had
been
denied
to
his
entreaties
he
only
repeated
his
solicitations
to
see
him
seconding
them
with
all
the
arguments
his
situation
could
suggest
thus
several
days
passed
in
remonstrance
on
one
side
and
inflexible
denial
on
the
other
for
whether
it
was
fear
or
shame
or
the
hatred
which
results
from
both
that
made
montoni
shun
the
man
he
had
injured
he
was
peremptory
in
his
refusal
and
was
neither
softened
to
pity
by
the
agony
which
valancourtâ€™s
letters
portrayed
nor
awakened
to
a
repentance
of
his
own
injustice
by
the
strong
remonstrances
he
employed
at
length
valancourtâ€™s
letters
were
returned
unopened
and
then
in
the
first
moments
of
passionate
despair
he
forgot
every
promise
to
emily
except
the
solemn
one
which
bound
him
to
avoid
violence
and
hastened
to
montoniâ€™s
chã¢teau
determined
to
see
him
by
whatever
other
means
might
be
necessary
montoni
was
denied
and
valancourt
when
he
afterwards
enquired
for
madame
and
maâ€™amselle
st
aubert
was
absolutely
refused
admittance
by
the
servants
not
choosing
to
submit
himself
to
a
contest
with
these
he
at
length
departed
and
returning
home
in
a
state
of
mind
approaching
to
frenzy
wrote
to
emily
of
what
had
passed
expressed
without
restraint
all
the
agony
of
his
heart
and
entreated
that
since
he
must
not
otherwise
hope
to
see
her
immediately
she
would
allow
him
an
interview
unknown
to
montoni
soon
after
he
had
dispatched
this
his
passions
becoming
more
temperate
he
was
sensible
of
the
error
he
had
committed
in
having
given
emily
a
new
subject
of
distress
in
the
strong
mention
of
his
own
suffering
and
would
have
given
half
the
world
had
it
been
his
to
recover
the
letter
emily
however
was
spared
the
pain
she
must
have
received
from
it
by
the
suspicious
policy
of
madame
montoni
who
had
ordered
that
all
letters
addressed
to
her
niece
should
be
delivered
to
herself
and
who
after
having
perused
this
and
indulged
the
expressions
of
resentment
which
valancourtâ€™s
mention
of
montoni
provoked
had
consigned
it
to
the
flames
montoni
meanwhile
every
day
more
impatient
to
leave
france
gave
repeated
orders
for
dispatch
to
the
servants
employed
in
preparations
for
the
journey
and
to
the
persons
with
whom
he
was
transacting
some
particular
business
he
preserved
a
steady
silence
to
the
letters
in
which
valancourt
despairing
of
greater
good
and
having
subdued
the
passion
that
had
transgressed
against
his
policy
solicited
only
the
indulgence
of
being
allowed
to
bid
emily
farewell
but
when
valancourt
learned
that
she
was
really
to
set
out
in
a
very
few
days
and
that
it
was
designed
he
should
see
her
no
more
forgetting
every
consideration
of
prudence
he
dared
in
a
second
letter
to
emily
to
propose
a
clandestine
marriage
this
also
was
transmitted
to
madame
montoni
and
the
last
day
of
emilyâ€™s
stay
at
thoulouse
arrived
without
affording
valancourt
even
a
line
to
sooth
his
sufferings
or
a
hope
that
he
should
be
allowed
a
parting
interview
during
this
period
of
torturing
suspense
to
valancourt
emily
was
sunk
into
that
kind
of
stupor
with
which
sudden
and
irremediable
misfortune
sometimes
overwhelms
the
mind
loving
him
with
the
tenderest
affection
and
having
long
been
accustomed
to
consider
him
as
the
friend
and
companion
of
all
her
future
days
she
had
no
ideas
of
happiness
that
were
not
connected
with
him
what
then
must
have
been
her
suffering
when
thus
suddenly
they
were
to
be
separated
perhaps
for
ever
certainly
to
be
thrown
into
distant
parts
of
the
world
where
they
could
scarcely
hear
of
each
otherâ€™s
existence
and
all
this
in
obedience
to
the
will
of
a
stranger
for
such
as
montoni
and
of
a
person
who
had
but
lately
been
anxious
to
hasten
their
nuptials
it
was
in
vain
that
she
endeavoured
to
subdue
her
grief
and
resign
herself
to
an
event
which
she
could
not
avoid
the
silence
of
valancourt
afflicted
more
than
it
surprised
her
since
she
attributed
it
to
its
just
occasion
but
when
the
day
preceding
that
on
which
she
was
to
quit
thoulouse
arrived
and
she
had
heard
no
mention
of
his
being
permitted
to
take
leave
of
her
grief
overcame
every
consideration
that
had
made
her
reluctant
to
speak
of
him
and
she
enquired
of
madame
montoni
whether
this
consolation
had
been
refused
her
aunt
informed
her
that
it
had
adding
that
after
the
provocation
she
had
herself
received
from
valancourt
in
their
last
interview
and
the
persecution
which
the
signor
had
suffered
from
his
letters
no
entreaties
should
avail
to
procure
it
â€œif
the
chevalier
expected
this
favour
from
usâ€
said
she
â€œhe
should
have
conducted
himself
in
a
very
different
manner
he
should
have
waited
patiently
till
he
knew
whether
we
were
disposed
to
grant
it
and
not
have
come
and
reproved
me
because
i
did
not
think
proper
to
bestow
my
niece
upon
him
and
then
have
persisted
in
troubling
the
signor
because
he
did
not
think
proper
to
enter
into
any
dispute
about
so
childish
an
affair
his
behaviour
throughout
has
been
extremely
presumptuous
and
impertinent
and
i
desire
that
i
may
never
hear
his
name
repeated
and
that
you
will
get
the
better
of
those
foolish
sorrows
and
whims
and
look
like
other
people
and
not
appear
with
that
dismal
countenance
as
if
you
were
ready
to
cry
for
though
you
say
nothing
you
cannot
conceal
your
grief
from
my
penetration
i
can
see
you
are
ready
to
cry
at
this
moment
though
i
am
reproving
you
for
it
aye
even
now
in
spite
of
my
commandsâ€
emily
having
turned
away
to
hide
her
tears
quitted
the
room
to
indulge
them
and
the
day
was
passed
in
an
intensity
of
anguish
such
as
she
had
perhaps
never
known
before
when
she
withdrew
to
her
chamber
for
the
night
she
remained
in
the
chair
where
she
had
placed
herself
on
entering
the
room
absorbed
in
her
grief
till
long
after
every
member
of
the
family
except
herself
was
retired
to
rest
she
could
not
divest
herself
of
a
belief
that
she
had
parted
with
valancourt
to
meet
no
more
a
belief
which
did
not
arise
merely
from
foreseen
circumstances
for
though
the
length
of
the
journey
she
was
about
to
commence
the
uncertainty
as
to
the
period
of
her
return
together
with
the
prohibitions
she
had
received
seemed
to
justify
it
she
yielded
also
to
an
impression
which
she
mistook
for
a
presentiment
that
she
was
going
from
valancourt
for
ever
how
dreadful
to
her
imagination
too
was
the
distance
that
would
separate
themâ€”the
alps
those
tremendous
barriers
would
rise
and
whole
countries
extend
between
the
regions
where
each
must
exist
to
live
in
adjoining
provinces
to
live
even
in
the
same
country
though
without
seeing
him
was
comparative
happiness
to
the
conviction
of
this
dreadful
length
of
distance
her
mind
was
at
length
so
much
agitated
by
the
consideration
of
her
state
and
the
belief
that
she
had
seen
valancourt
for
the
last
time
that
she
suddenly
became
very
faint
and
looking
round
the
chamber
for
something
that
might
revive
her
she
observed
the
casements
and
had
just
strength
to
throw
one
open
near
which
she
seated
herself
the
air
recalled
her
spirits
and
the
still
moonlight
that
fell
upon
the
elms
of
a
long
avenue
fronting
the
window
somewhat
soothed
them
and
determined
her
to
try
whether
exercise
and
the
open
air
would
not
relieve
the
intense
pain
that
bound
her
temples
in
the
chã¢teau
all
was
still
and
passing
down
the
great
staircase
into
the
hall
from
whence
a
passage
led
immediately
to
the
garden
she
softly
and
unheard
as
she
thought
unlocked
the
door
and
entered
the
avenue
emily
passed
on
with
steps
now
hurried
and
now
faltering
as
deceived
by
the
shadows
among
the
trees
she
fancied
she
saw
some
person
move
in
the
distant
perspective
and
feared
that
it
was
a
spy
of
madame
montoni
her
desire
however
to
revisit
the
pavilion
where
she
had
passed
so
many
happy
hours
with
valancourt
and
had
admired
with
him
the
extensive
prospect
over
languedoc
and
her
native
gascony
overcame
her
apprehension
of
being
observed
and
she
moved
on
towards
the
terrace
which
running
along
the
upper
garden
commanded
the
whole
of
the
lower
one
and
communicated
with
it
by
a
flight
of
marble
steps
that
terminated
the
avenue
having
reached
these
steps
she
paused
a
moment
to
look
round
for
her
distance
from
the
chã¢teau
now
increased
the
fear
which
the
stillness
and
obscurity
of
the
hour
had
awakened
but
perceiving
nothing
that
could
justify
it
she
ascended
to
the
terrace
where
the
moonlight
showed
the
long
broad
walk
with
the
pavilion
at
its
extremity
while
the
rays
silvered
the
foliage
of
the
high
trees
and
shrubs
that
bordered
it
on
the
right
and
the
tufted
summits
of
those
that
rose
to
a
level
with
the
balustrade
on
the
left
from
the
garden
below
her
distance
from
the
chã¢teau
again
alarming
her
she
paused
to
listen
the
night
was
so
calm
that
no
sound
could
have
escaped
her
but
she
heard
only
the
plaintive
sweetness
of
the
nightingale
with
the
light
shiver
of
the
leaves
and
she
pursued
her
way
towards
the
pavilion
having
reached
which
its
obscurity
did
not
prevent
the
emotion
that
a
fuller
view
of
its
well-known
scene
would
have
excited
the
lattices
were
thrown
back
and
showed
beyond
their
embowered
arch
the
moonlight
landscape
shadowy
and
soft
its
groves
and
plains
extending
gradually
and
indistinctly
to
the
eye
its
distant
mountains
catching
a
stronger
gleam
and
the
nearer
river
reflecting
the
moon
and
trembling
to
her
rays
emily
as
she
approached
the
lattice
was
sensible
of
the
features
of
this
scene
only
as
they
served
to
bring
valancourt
more
immediately
to
her
fancy
â€œahâ€
said
she
with
a
heavy
sigh
as
she
threw
herself
into
a
chair
by
the
window
â€œhow
often
have
we
sat
together
in
this
spotâ€”often
have
looked
upon
that
landscape
never
never
more
shall
we
view
it
togetherâ€”neverâ€”never
more
perhaps
shall
we
look
upon
each
otherâ€
her
tears
were
suddenly
stopped
by
terrorâ€”a
voice
spoke
near
her
in
the
pavilion
she
shriekedâ€”it
spoke
again
and
she
distinguished
the
well-known
tones
of
valancourt
it
was
indeed
valancourt
who
supported
her
in
his
arms
for
some
moments
their
emotion
would
not
suffer
either
to
speak
â€œemilyâ€
said
valancourt
at
length
as
he
pressed
her
hand
in
his
â€œemilyâ€
and
he
was
again
silent
but
the
accent
in
which
he
had
pronounced
her
name
expressed
all
his
tenderness
and
sorrow
â€œo
my
emilyâ€
he
resumed
after
a
long
pause
â€œi
do
then
see
you
once
again
and
hear
again
the
sound
of
that
voice
i
have
haunted
this
placeâ€”these
gardens
for
manyâ€”many
nights
with
a
faint
very
faint
hope
of
seeing
you
this
was
the
only
chance
that
remained
to
me
and
thank
heaven
it
has
at
length
succeededâ€”i
am
not
condemned
to
absolute
despairâ€
emily
said
something
she
scarcely
knew
what
expressive
of
her
unalterable
affection
and
endeavoured
to
calm
the
agitation
of
his
mind
but
valancourt
could
for
some
time
only
utter
incoherent
expressions
of
his
emotions
and
when
he
was
somewhat
more
composed
he
said
â€œi
came
hither
soon
after
sunset
and
have
been
watching
in
the
gardens
and
in
this
pavilion
ever
since
for
though
i
had
now
given
up
all
hope
of
seeing
you
i
could
not
resolve
to
tear
myself
from
a
place
so
near
to
you
and
should
probably
have
lingered
about
the
chã¢teau
till
morning
dawned
o
how
heavily
the
moments
have
passed
yet
with
what
various
emotion
have
they
been
marked
as
i
sometimes
thought
i
heard
footsteps
and
fancied
you
were
approaching
and
then
againâ€”perceived
only
a
dead
and
dreary
silence
but
when
you
opened
the
door
of
the
pavilion
and
the
darkness
prevented
my
distinguishing
with
certainty
whether
it
was
my
loveâ€”my
heart
beat
so
strongly
with
hopes
and
fears
that
i
could
not
speak
the
instant
i
heard
the
plaintive
accents
of
your
voice
my
doubts
vanished
but
not
my
fears
till
you
spoke
of
me
then
losing
the
apprehension
of
alarming
you
in
the
excess
of
my
emotion
i
could
no
longer
be
silent
o
emily
these
are
moments
in
which
joy
and
grief
struggle
so
powerfully
for
pre-eminence
that
the
heart
can
scarcely
support
the
contestâ€
emilyâ€™s
heart
acknowledged
the
truth
of
this
assertion
but
the
joy
she
felt
on
thus
meeting
valancourt
at
the
very
moment
when
she
was
lamenting
that
they
must
probably
meet
no
more
soon
melted
into
grief
as
reflection
stole
over
her
thoughts
and
imagination
prompted
visions
of
the
future
she
struggled
to
recover
the
calm
dignity
of
mind
which
was
necessary
to
support
her
through
this
last
interview
and
which
valancourt
found
it
utterly
impossible
to
attain
for
the
transports
of
his
joy
changed
abruptly
into
those
of
suffering
and
he
expressed
in
the
most
impassioned
language
his
horror
of
this
separation
and
his
despair
of
their
ever
meeting
again
emily
wept
silently
as
she
listened
to
him
and
then
trying
to
command
her
own
distress
and
to
sooth
his
she
suggested
every
circumstance
that
could
lead
to
hope
but
the
energy
of
his
fears
led
him
instantly
to
detect
the
friendly
fallacies
which
she
endeavoured
to
impose
on
herself
and
him
and
also
to
conjure
up
illusions
too
powerful
for
his
reason
â€œyou
are
going
from
meâ€
said
he
â€œto
a
distant
country
o
how
distantâ€”to
new
society
new
friends
new
admirers
with
people
too
who
will
try
to
make
you
forget
me
and
to
promote
new
connections
how
can
i
know
this
and
not
know
that
you
will
never
return
for
meâ€”never
can
be
mineâ€
his
voice
was
stifled
by
sighs
â€œyou
believe
thenâ€
said
emily
â€œthat
the
pangs
i
suffer
proceed
from
a
trivial
and
temporary
interest
you
believeâ€”â€
â€œsufferâ€
interrupted
valancourt
â€œsuffer
for
me
o
emilyâ€”how
sweetâ€”how
bitter
are
those
words
what
comfort
what
anguish
do
they
give
i
ought
not
to
doubt
the
steadiness
of
your
affection
yet
such
is
the
inconsistency
of
real
love
that
it
is
always
awake
to
suspicion
however
unreasonable
always
requiring
new
assurances
from
the
object
of
its
interest
and
thus
it
is
that
i
always
feel
revived
as
by
a
new
conviction
when
your
words
tell
me
i
am
dear
to
you
and
wanting
these
i
relapse
into
doubt
and
too
often
into
despondencyâ€
then
seeming
to
recollect
himself
he
exclaimed
â€œbut
what
a
wretch
am
i
thus
to
torture
you
and
in
these
moments
too
i
who
ought
to
support
and
comfort
youâ€
this
reflection
overcame
valancourt
with
tenderness
but
relapsing
into
despondency
he
again
felt
only
for
himself
and
lamented
again
this
cruel
separation
in
a
voice
and
words
so
impassioned
that
emily
could
no
longer
struggle
to
repress
her
own
grief
or
to
sooth
his
valancourt
between
these
emotions
of
love
and
pity
lost
the
power
and
almost
the
wish
of
repressing
his
agitation
and
in
the
intervals
of
convulsive
sobs
he
at
one
moment
kissed
away
her
tears
then
told
her
cruelly
that
possibly
she
might
never
again
weep
for
him
and
then
tried
to
speak
more
calmly
but
only
exclaimed
â€œo
emilyâ€”my
heart
will
breakâ€”i
cannotâ€”cannot
leave
you
nowâ€”i
gaze
upon
that
countenance
now
i
hold
you
in
my
arms
a
little
while
and
all
this
will
appear
a
dream
i
shall
look
and
cannot
see
you
shall
try
to
recollect
your
featuresâ€”and
the
impression
will
be
fled
from
my
imaginationâ€”to
hear
the
tones
of
your
voice
and
even
memory
will
be
silentâ€”i
cannot
cannot
leave
you
why
should
we
confide
the
happiness
of
our
whole
lives
to
the
will
of
people
who
have
no
right
to
interrupt
and
except
in
giving
you
to
me
have
no
power
to
promote
it
o
emily
venture
to
trust
your
own
heart
venture
to
be
mine
for
everâ€
his
voice
trembled
and
he
was
silent
emily
continued
to
weep
and
was
silent
also
when
valancourt
proceeded
to
propose
an
immediate
marriage
and
that
at
an
early
hour
on
the
following
morning
she
should
quit
madame
montoniâ€™s
house
and
be
conducted
by
him
to
the
church
of
the
augustines
where
a
friar
should
await
to
unite
them
the
silence
with
which
she
listened
to
a
proposal
dictated
by
love
and
despair
and
enforced
at
a
moment
when
it
seemed
scarcely
possible
for
her
to
oppose
itâ€”when
her
heart
was
softened
by
the
sorrows
of
a
separation
that
might
be
eternal
and
her
reason
obscured
by
the
illusions
of
love
and
terror
encouraged
him
to
hope
that
it
would
not
be
rejected
â€œspeak
my
emilyâ€
said
valancourt
eagerly
â€œlet
me
hear
your
voice
let
me
hear
you
confirm
my
fateâ€
she
spoke
not
her
cheek
was
cold
and
her
senses
seemed
to
fail
her
but
she
did
not
faint
to
valancourtâ€™s
terrified
imagination
she
appeared
to
be
dying
he
called
upon
her
name
rose
to
go
to
the
chã¢teau
for
assistance
and
then
recollecting
her
situation
feared
to
go
or
to
leave
her
for
a
moment
after
a
few
minutes
she
drew
a
deep
sigh
and
began
to
revive
the
conflict
she
had
suffered
between
love
and
the
duty
she
at
present
owed
to
her
fatherâ€™s
sister
her
repugnance
to
a
clandestine
marriage
her
fear
of
emerging
on
the
world
with
embarrassments
such
as
might
ultimately
involve
the
object
of
her
affection
in
misery
and
repentanceâ€”all
this
various
interest
was
too
powerful
for
a
mind
already
enervated
by
sorrow
and
her
reason
had
suffered
a
transient
suspension
but
duty
and
good
sense
however
hard
the
conflict
at
length
triumphed
over
affection
and
mournful
presentiment
above
all
she
dreaded
to
involve
valancourt
in
obscurity
and
vain
regret
which
she
saw
or
thought
she
saw
must
be
the
too
certain
consequence
of
a
marriage
in
their
present
circumstances
and
she
acted
perhaps
with
somewhat
more
than
female
fortitude
when
she
resolved
to
endure
a
present
rather
than
provoke
a
distant
misfortune
with
a
candour
that
proved
how
truly
she
esteemed
and
loved
him
and
which
endeared
her
to
him
if
possible
more
than
ever
she
told
valancourt
all
her
reasons
for
rejecting
his
proposals
those
which
influenced
her
concerning
his
future
welfare
he
instantly
refuted
or
rather
contradicted
but
they
awakened
tender
considerations
for
her
which
the
frenzy
of
passion
and
despair
had
concealed
before
and
love
which
had
but
lately
prompted
him
to
propose
a
clandestine
and
immediate
marriage
now
induced
him
to
renounce
it
the
triumph
was
almost
too
much
for
his
heart
for
emilyâ€™s
sake
he
endeavoured
to
stifle
his
grief
but
the
swelling
anguish
would
not
be
restrained
â€œo
emilyâ€
said
he
â€œi
must
leave
youâ€”i
must
leave
you
and
i
know
it
is
for
everâ€
convulsive
sobs
again
interrupted
his
words
and
they
wept
together
in
silence
till
emily
recollecting
the
danger
of
being
discovered
and
the
impropriety
of
prolonging
an
interview
which
might
subject
her
to
censure
summoned
all
her
fortitude
to
utter
a
last
farewell
â€œstayâ€
said
valancourt
â€œi
conjure
you
stay
for
i
have
much
to
tell
you
the
agitation
of
my
mind
has
hitherto
suffered
me
to
speak
only
on
the
subject
that
occupied
itâ€”i
have
forborne
to
mention
a
doubt
of
much
importance
partly
lest
it
should
appear
as
if
i
told
it
with
an
ungenerous
view
of
alarming
you
into
a
compliance
with
my
late
proposalâ€
emily
much
agitated
did
not
leave
valancourt
but
she
led
him
from
the
pavilion
and
as
they
walked
upon
the
terrace
he
proceeded
as
follows
â€œthis
montoni
i
have
heard
some
strange
hints
concerning
him
are
you
certain
he
is
of
madame
quesnelâ€™s
family
and
that
his
fortune
is
what
it
appears
to
beâ€
â€œi
have
no
reason
to
doubt
eitherâ€
replied
emily
in
a
voice
of
alarm
â€œof
the
first
indeed
i
cannot
doubt
but
i
have
no
certain
means
of
judging
of
the
latter
and
i
entreat
you
will
tell
me
all
you
have
heardâ€
â€œthat
i
certainly
will
but
it
is
very
imperfect
and
unsatisfactory
information
i
gathered
it
by
accident
from
an
italian
who
was
speaking
to
another
person
of
this
montoni
they
were
talking
of
his
marriage
the
italian
said
that
if
he
was
the
person
he
meant
he
was
not
likely
to
make
madame
cheron
happy
he
proceeded
to
speak
of
him
in
general
terms
of
dislike
and
then
gave
some
particular
hints
concerning
his
character
that
excited
my
curiosity
and
i
ventured
to
ask
him
a
few
questions
he
was
reserved
in
his
replies
but
after
hesitating
for
some
time
he
owned
that
he
had
understood
abroad
that
montoni
was
a
man
of
desperate
fortune
and
character
he
said
something
of
a
castle
of
montoniâ€™s
situated
among
the
apennines
and
of
some
strange
circumstances
that
might
be
mentioned
as
to
his
former
mode
of
life
i
pressed
him
to
inform
me
further
but
i
believe
the
strong
interest
i
felt
was
visible
in
my
manner
and
alarmed
him
for
no
entreaties
could
prevail
with
him
to
give
any
explanation
of
the
circumstances
he
had
alluded
to
or
to
mention
anything
further
concerning
montoni
i
observed
to
him
that
if
montoni
was
possessed
of
a
castle
in
the
apennines
it
appeared
from
such
a
circumstance
that
he
was
of
some
family
and
also
seemed
to
contradict
the
report
that
he
was
a
man
of
entirely
broken
fortunes
he
shook
his
head
and
looked
as
if
he
could
have
said
a
great
deal
but
made
no
reply
â€œa
hope
of
learning
something
more
satisfactory
or
more
positive
detained
me
in
his
company
a
considerable
time
and
i
renewed
the
subject
repeatedly
but
the
italian
wrapped
himself
up
in
reserve
saidâ€”that
what
he
had
mentioned
he
had
caught
only
from
a
floating
report
and
that
reports
frequently
arose
from
personal
malice
and
were
very
little
to
be
depended
upon
i
forbore
to
press
the
subject
farther
since
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
alarmed
for
the
consequence
of
what
he
had
already
said
and
i
was
compelled
to
remain
in
uncertainty
on
a
point
where
suspense
is
almost
intolerable
think
emily
what
i
must
suffer
to
see
you
depart
for
a
foreign
country
committed
to
the
power
of
a
man
of
such
doubtful
character
as
is
this
montoni
but
i
will
not
alarm
you
unnecessarilyâ€”it
is
possible
as
the
italian
said
at
first
that
this
is
not
the
montoni
he
alluded
to
yet
emily
consider
well
before
you
resolve
to
commit
yourself
to
him
o
i
must
not
trust
myself
to
speakâ€”or
i
shall
renounce
all
the
motives
which
so
lately
influenced
me
to
resign
the
hope
of
your
becoming
mine
immediatelyâ€
valancourt
walked
upon
the
terrace
with
hurried
steps
while
emily
remained
leaning
on
the
balustrade
in
deep
thought
the
information
she
had
just
received
excited
perhaps
more
alarm
than
it
could
justify
and
raised
once
more
the
conflict
of
contrasted
interests
she
had
never
liked
montoni
the
fire
and
keenness
of
his
eye
its
proud
exultation
its
bold
fierceness
its
sullen
watchfulness
as
occasion
and
even
slight
occasion
had
called
forth
the
latent
soul
she
had
often
observed
with
emotion
while
from
the
usual
expression
of
his
countenance
she
had
always
shrunk
from
such
observations
she
was
the
more
inclined
to
believe
that
it
was
this
montoni
of
whom
the
italian
had
uttered
his
suspicious
hints
the
thought
of
being
solely
in
his
power
in
a
foreign
land
was
terrifying
to
her
but
it
was
not
by
terror
alone
that
she
was
urged
to
an
immediate
marriage
with
valancourt
the
tenderest
love
had
already
pleaded
his
cause
but
had
been
unable
to
overcome
her
opinion
as
to
her
duty
her
disinterested
considerations
for
valancourt
and
the
delicacy
which
made
her
revolt
from
a
clandestine
union
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
a
vague
terror
would
be
more
powerful
than
the
united
influence
of
love
and
grief
but
it
recalled
all
their
energy
and
rendered
a
second
conquest
necessary
with
valancourt
whose
imagination
was
now
awake
to
the
suggestion
of
every
passion
whose
apprehensions
for
emily
had
acquired
strength
by
the
mere
mention
of
them
and
became
every
instant
more
powerful
as
his
mind
brooded
over
themâ€”with
valancourt
no
second
conquest
was
attainable
he
thought
he
saw
in
the
clearest
light
and
love
assisted
the
fear
that
this
journey
to
italy
would
involve
emily
in
misery
he
determined
therefore
to
persevere
in
opposing
it
and
in
conjuring
her
to
bestow
upon
him
the
title
of
her
lawful
protector
â€œemilyâ€
said
he
with
solemn
earnestness
â€œthis
is
no
time
for
scrupulous
distinctions
for
weighing
the
dubious
and
comparatively
trifling
circumstances
that
may
affect
our
future
comfort
i
now
see
much
more
clearly
than
before
the
train
of
serious
dangers
you
are
going
to
encounter
with
a
man
of
montoniâ€™s
character
those
dark
hints
of
the
italian
spoke
much
but
not
more
than
the
idea
i
have
of
montoniâ€™s
disposition
as
exhibited
even
in
his
countenance
i
think
i
see
at
this
moment
all
that
could
have
been
hinted
written
there
he
is
the
italian
whom
i
fear
and
i
conjure
you
for
your
own
sake
as
well
as
for
mine
to
prevent
the
evils
i
shudder
to
foresee
o
emily
let
my
tenderness
my
arms
withhold
you
from
themâ€”give
me
the
right
to
defend
youâ€
emily
only
sighed
while
valancourt
proceeded
to
remonstrate
and
to
entreat
with
all
the
energy
that
love
and
apprehension
could
inspire
but
as
his
imagination
magnified
to
her
the
possible
evils
she
was
going
to
meet
the
mists
of
her
own
fancy
began
to
dissipate
and
allowed
her
to
distinguish
the
exaggerated
images
which
imposed
on
his
reason
she
considered
that
there
was
no
proof
of
montoni
being
the
person
whom
the
stranger
had
meant
that
even
if
he
was
so
the
italian
had
noticed
his
character
and
broken
fortunes
merely
from
report
and
that
though
the
countenance
of
montoni
seemed
to
give
probability
to
a
part
of
the
rumour
it
was
not
by
such
circumstances
that
an
implicit
belief
of
it
could
be
justified
these
considerations
would
probably
not
have
arisen
so
distinctly
to
her
mind
at
this
time
had
not
the
terrors
of
valancourt
presented
to
her
such
obvious
exaggerations
of
her
danger
as
incited
her
to
distrust
the
fallacies
of
passion
but
while
she
endeavoured
in
the
gentlest
manner
to
convince
him
of
his
error
she
plunged
him
into
a
new
one
his
voice
and
countenance
changed
to
an
expression
of
dark
despair
â€œemilyâ€
said
he
â€œthis
this
moment
is
the
bitterest
that
is
yet
come
to
me
you
do
notâ€”cannot
love
meâ€”it
would
be
impossible
for
you
to
reason
thus
coolly
thus
deliberately
if
you
did
i
i
am
torn
with
anguish
at
the
prospect
of
our
separation
and
of
the
evils
that
may
await
you
in
consequence
of
it
i
would
encounter
any
hazards
to
prevent
itâ€”to
save
you
no
emily
noâ€”you
cannot
love
meâ€
â€œwe
have
now
little
time
to
waste
in
exclamation
or
assertionâ€
said
emily
endeavouring
to
conceal
her
emotion
â€œif
you
are
yet
to
learn
how
dear
you
are
and
ever
must
be
to
my
heart
no
assurances
of
mine
can
give
you
convictionâ€
the
last
words
faltered
on
her
lips
and
her
tears
flowed
fast
these
words
and
tears
brought
once
more
and
with
instantaneous
force
conviction
of
her
love
to
valancourt
he
could
only
exclaim
â€œemily
emilyâ€
and
weep
over
the
hand
he
pressed
to
his
lips
but
she
after
some
moments
again
roused
herself
from
the
indulgence
of
sorrow
and
said
â€œi
must
leave
you
it
is
late
and
my
absence
from
the
chã¢teau
may
be
discovered
think
of
meâ€”love
meâ€”when
i
am
far
away
the
belief
of
this
will
be
my
comfortâ€
â€œthink
of
youâ€”love
youâ€
exclaimed
valancourt
â€œtry
to
moderate
these
transportsâ€
said
emily
â€œfor
my
sake
tryâ€
â€œfor
your
sakeâ€
â€œyes
for
my
sakeâ€
replied
emily
in
a
tremulous
voice
â€œi
cannot
leave
you
thusâ€
â€œthen
do
not
leave
meâ€
said
valancourt
with
quickness
â€œwhy
should
we
part
or
part
for
longer
than
till
tomorrowâ€
â€œi
am
indeed
i
am
unequal
to
these
momentsâ€
replied
emily
â€œyou
tear
my
heart
but
i
never
can
consent
to
this
hasty
imprudent
proposalâ€
â€œif
we
could
command
our
time
my
emily
it
should
not
be
thus
hasty

must
submit
to
circumstancesâ€
â€œwe
must
indeed
i
have
already
told
you
all
my
heartâ€”my
spirits
are
gone
you
allowed
the
force
of
my
objections
till
your
tenderness
called
up
vague
terrors
which
have
given
us
both

do
not
oblige
me
to
repeat
the
reasons
i
have
already
urgedâ€
â€œspare

cried
valancourt
â€œi
am
a
wretchâ€”a
very
wretch
that
have
felt
only
for
myselfâ€”i
who
ought
to
have
shown
the
fortitude
of
a
man
who
ought
to
have
supported

i
have
increased
your
sufferings

think
of
the
distraction
of
my
mind
now
that
i
am
about
to
part
with
all
that
is
dear
to
meâ€”and
forgive
me
when
you
are
gone
i
shall
recollect
with
bitter
remorse
what
i
have
made
you
suffer
and
shall
wish
in

that
i
could
see
you
if
only
for
a
moment
that
i
might
sooth
your
griefâ€
tears
again
interrupted
his
voice
and
emily
wept
with
him
â€œi
will
show
myself
more
worthy
of
your
loveâ€
said
valancourt
at
length
â€œi
will
not
prolong
these
moments
my
emilyâ€”my
own
emily
never
forget
me
god
knows
when
we
shall
meet
again
i
resign
you
to

careâ€”o
godâ€”o
godâ€”protect
and
bless
herâ€
he
pressed
her
hand
to
his
heart
emily
sunk
almost
lifeless
on
his
bosom
and
neither
wept
nor
spoke
valancourt
now
commanding
his
own
distress
tried
to
comfort
and
reassure
her
but
she
appeared
totally
unaffected
by
what
he
said
and
a
sigh
which
she
uttered
now
and
then
was
all
that
proved
she
had
not
fainted
he
supported
her
slowly
towards
the
chã¢teau
weeping
and
speaking
to
her
but
she
answered
only
in
sighs
till
having
reached
the
gate
that
terminated
the
avenue
she
seemed
to
have
recovered
her
consciousness
and
looking
round
perceived
how
near
they
were
to
the
chã¢teau
â€œwe
must
part
hereâ€
said
she
stopping
â€œwhy
prolong
these
moments
teach
me
the
fortitude
i
have
forgotâ€
valancourt
struggled
to
assume
a
composed
air
â€œfarewell
my
loveâ€
said
he
in
a
voice
of
solemn
tendernessâ€”â€œtrust
me
we
shall
meet
againâ€”meet
for
each
otherâ€”meet
to
part
no
moreâ€
his
voice
faltered
but
recovering
it
he
proceeded
in
a
firmer
tone
â€œyou
know
not
what
i
shall
suffer
till
i
hear
from
you
i
shall
omit
no
opportunity
of
conveying
to
you
my
letters
yet
i
tremble
to
think
how
few
may
occur
and
trust

for
your
dear
sake
i
will
try
to
bear
this
absence
with
fortitude
o
how
little
i
have
shown
tonightâ€
â€œfarewellâ€
said
emily
faintly
â€œwhen
you
are
gone
i
shall
think
of
many
things
i
would
have
said
to
youâ€
â€œand
i
of
manyâ€”manyâ€
said
valancourt
â€œi
never
left
you
yet
that
i
did
not
immediately
remember
some
question
or
some
entreaty
or
some
circumstance
concerning
my
love
that
i
earnestly
wished
to
mention
and
feel
wretched
because
i
could
not
o
emily
this
countenance
on
which
i
now
gazeâ€”will
in
a
moment
be
gone
from
my
eyes
and
not
all
the
efforts
of
fancy
will
be
able
to
recall
it
with
exactness
o
what
an
infinite
difference
between
this
moment
and
the
nextâ€”now
i
am
in
your
presence
can
behold
you
then
all
will
be
a
dreary
blankâ€”and
i
shall
be
a
wanderer
exiled
from
my
only
homeâ€
valancourt
again
pressed
her
to
his
heart
and
held
her
there
in
silence
weeping
tears
once
again
calmed
her
oppressed
mind
they
again
bade
each
other
farewell
lingered
a
moment
and
then
parted
valancourt
seemed
to
force
himself
from
the
spot
he
passed
hastily
up
the
avenue
and
emily
as
she
moved
slowly
towards
the
chã¢teau
heard
his
distant
steps
she
listened
to
the
sounds
as
they
sunk
fainter
and
fainter
till
the
melancholy
stillness
of
night
alone
remained
and
then
hurried
to
her
chamber
to
seek
repose
which
alas
was
fled
from
her
wretchedness

goldsmith
the
carriages
were
at
the
gates
at
an
early
hour
the
bustle
of
the
domestics
passing
to
and
fro
in
the
galleries
awakened
emily
from
harassing
slumbers
her
unquiet
mind
had
during
the
night
presented
her
with
terrific
images
and
obscure
circumstances
concerning
her
affection
and
her
future
life
she
now
endeavoured
to
chase
away
the
impressions
they
had
left
on
her
fancy
but
from
imaginary
evils
she
awoke
to
the
consciousness
of
real
ones
recollecting
that
she
had
parted
with
valancourt
perhaps
for
ever
her
heart
sickened
as
memory
revived
but
she
tried
to
dismiss
the
dismal
forebodings
that
crowded
on
her
mind
and
to
restrain
the
sorrow
which
she
could
not
subdue
efforts
which
diffused
over
the
settled
melancholy
of
her
countenance
an
expression
of
tempered
resignation
as
a
thin
veil
thrown
over
the
features
of
beauty
renders
them
more
interesting
by
a
partial
concealment
but
madame
montoni
observed
nothing
in
this
countenance
except
its
usual
paleness
which
attracted
her
censure
she
told
her
niece
that
she
had
been
indulging
in
fanciful
sorrows
and
begged
she
would
have
more
regard
for
decorum
than
to
let
the
world
see
that
she
could
not
renounce
an
improper
attachment
at
which
emilyâ€™s
pale
cheek
became
flushed
with
crimson
but
it
was
the
blush
of
pride
and
she
made
no
answer
soon
after
montoni
entered
the
breakfast
room
spoke
little
and
seemed
impatient
to
be
gone
the
windows
of
this
room
opened
upon
the
garden
as
emily
passed
them
she
saw
the
spot
where
she
had
parted
with
valancourt
on
the
preceding
night
the
remembrance
pressed
heavily
on
her
heart
and
she
turned
hastily
away
from
the
object
that
had
awakened
it
the
baggage
being
at
length
adjusted
the
travellers
entered
their
carriages
and
emily
would
have
left
the
chã¢teau
without
one
sigh
of
regret
had
it
not
been
situated
in
the
neighbourhood
of
valancourtâ€™s
residence
from
a
little
eminence
she
looked
back
upon
thoulouse
and
the
far-seen
plains
of
gascony
beyond
which
the
broken
summits
of
the
pyrenees
appeared
on
the
distant
horizon
lighted
up
by
a
morning
sun
â€œdear
pleasant
mountainsâ€
said
she
to
herself
â€œhow
long
may
it
be
ere
i
see
ye
again
and
how
much
may
happen
to
make
me
miserable
in
the
interval
oh
could
i
now
be
certain
that
i
should
ever
return
to
ye
and
find
that

impended
over
the
high
banks
of
the
road
and
formed
a
line
of
perspective
with
the
distant
country
now
threatened
to
exclude
the
view
of
them
but
the
bluish
mountains
still
appeared
beyond
the
dark
foliage
and
emily
continued
to
lean
from
the
coach
window
till
at
length
the
closing
branches
shut
them
from
her
sight
another
object
soon
caught
her
attention
she
had
scarcely
looked
at
a
person
who
walked
along
the
bank
with
his
hat
in
which
was
the
military
feather
drawn
over
his
eyes
before
at
the
sound
of
wheels
he
suddenly
turned
and
she
perceived
that
it
was
valancourt
himself
who
waved
his
hand
sprung
into
the
road
and
through
the
window
of
the
carriage
put
a
letter
into
her
hand
he
endeavoured
to
smile
through
the
despair
that
overspread
his
countenance
as
she
passed
on
the
remembrance
of
that
smile
seemed
impressed
on
emilyâ€™s
mind
for
ever
she
leaned
from
the
window
and
saw
him
on
a
knoll
of
the
broken
bank
leaning
against
the
high
trees
that
waved
over
him
and
pursuing
the
carriage
with
his
eyes
he
waved
his
hand
and
she
continued
to
gaze
till
distance
confused
his
figure
and
at
length
another
turn
of
the
road
entirely
separated
him
from
her
sight
having
stopped
to
take
up
signor
cavigni
at
a
chã¢teau
on
the
road
the
travellers
of
whom
emily
was
disrespectfully
seated
with
madame
montoniâ€™s
woman
in
a
second
carriage
pursued
their
way
over
the
plains
of
languedoc
the
presence
of
this
servant
restrained
emily
from
reading
valancourtâ€™s
letter
for
she
did
not
choose
to
expose
the
emotions
it
might
occasion
to
the
observation
of
any
person
yet
such
was
her
wish
to
read
this
his
last
communication
that
her
trembling
hand
was
every
moment
on
the
point
of
breaking
the
seal
at
length
they
reached
the
village
where
they
staid
only
to
change
horses
without
alighting
and
it
was
not
till
they
stopped
to
dine
that
emily
had
an
opportunity
of
reading
the
letter
though
she
had
never
doubted
the
sincerity
of
valancourtâ€™s
affection
the
fresh
assurances
she
now
received
of
it
revived
her
spirits
she
wept
over
his
letter
in
tenderness
laid
it
by
to
be
referred
to
when
they
should
be
particularly
depressed
and
then
thought
of
him
with
much
less
anguish
than
she
had
done
since
they
parted
among
some
other
requests
which
were
interesting
to
her
because
expressive
of
his
tenderness
and
because
a
compliance
with
them
seemed
to
annihilate
for
a
while
the
pain
of
absence
he
entreated
she
would
always
think
of
him
at
sunset
â€œyou
will
then
meet
me
in
thoughtâ€
said
he
â€œi
shall
constantly
watch
the
sunset
and
i
shall
be
happy
in
the
belief
that
your
eyes
are
fixed
upon
the
same
object
with
mine
and
that
our
minds
are
conversing
you
know
not
emily
the
comfort
i
promise
myself
from
these
moments
but
i
trust
you
will
experience
itâ€
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
with
what
emotion
emily
on
this
evening
watched
the
declining
sun
over
a
long
extent
of
plains
on
which
she
saw
it
set
without
interruption
and
sink
towards
the
province
which
valancourt
inhabited
after
this
hour
her
mind
became
far
more
tranquil
and
resigned
than
it
had
been
since
the
marriage
of
montoni
and
her
aunt
during
several
days
the
travellers
journeyed
over
the
plains
of
languedoc
and
then
entering
dauphiny
and
winding
for
some
time
among
the
mountains
of
that
romantic
province
they
quitted
their
carriages
and
began
to
ascend
the
alps
and
here
such
scenes
of
sublimity
opened
upon
them
as
no
colours
of
language
must
dare
to
paint
emilyâ€™s
mind
was
even
so
much
engaged
with
new
and
wonderful
images
that
they
sometimes
banished
the
idea
of
valancourt
though
they
more
frequently
revived
it
these
brought
to
her
recollection
the
prospects
among
the
pyrenees
which
they
had
admired
together
and
had
believed
nothing
could
excel
in
grandeur
how
often
did
she
wish
to
express
to
him
the
new
emotions
which
this
astonishing
scenery
awakened
and
that
he
could
partake
of
them
sometimes
too
she
endeavoured
to
anticipate
his
remarks
and
almost
imagined
him
present
she
seemed
to
have
arisen
into
another
world
and
to
have
left
every
trifling
thought
every
trifling
sentiment
in
that
below
those
only
of
grandeur
and
sublimity
now
dilated
her
mind
and
elevated
the
affections
of
her
heart
with
what
emotions
of
sublimity
softened
by
tenderness
did
she
meet
valancourt
in
thought
at
the
customary
hour
of
sunset
when
wandering
among
the
alps
she
watched
the
glorious
orb
sink
amid
their
summits
his
last
tints
die
away
on
their
snowy
points
and
a
solemn
obscurity
steal
over
the
scene
and
when
the
last
gleam
had
faded
she
turned
her
eyes
from
the
west
with
somewhat
of
the
melancholy
regret
that
is
experienced
after
the
departure
of
a
beloved
friend
while
these
lonely
feelings
were
heightened
by
the
spreading
gloom
and
by
the
low
sounds
heard
only
when
darkness
confines
attention
which
make
the
general
stillness
more
impressiveâ€”leaves
shook
by
the
air
the
last
sigh
of
the
breeze
that
lingers
after
sunset
or
the
murmur
of
distant
streams
during
the
first
days
of
this
journey
among
the
alps
the
scenery
exhibited
a
wonderful
mixture
of
solitude
and
inhabitation
of
cultivation
and
barrenness
on
the
edge
of
tremendous
precipices
and
within
the
hollow
of
the
cliffs
below
which
the
clouds
often
floated
were
seen
villages
spires
and
convent
towers
while
green
pastures
and
vineyards
spread
their
hues
at
the
feet
of
perpendicular
rocks
of
marble
or
of
granite
whose
points
tufted
with
alpine
shrubs
or
exhibiting
only
massy
crags
rose
above
each
other
till
they
terminated
in
the
snowtopped
mountain
whence
the
torrent
fell
that
thundered
along
the
valley
the
snow
was
not
yet
melted
on
the
summit
of
mount
cenis
over
which
the
travellers
passed
but
emily
as
she
looked
upon
its
clear
lake
and
extended
plain
surrounded
by
broken
cliffs
saw
in
imagination
the
verdant
beauty
it
would
exhibit
when
the
snows
should
be
gone
and
the
shepherds
leading
up
the
midsummer
flocks
from
piedmont
to
pasture
on
its
flowery
summit
should
add
arcadian
figures
to
arcadian
landscape
as
she
descended
on
the
italian
side
the
precipices
became
still
more
tremendous
and
the
prospects
still
more
wild
and
majestic
over
which
the
shifting
lights
threw
all
the
pomp
of
colouring
emily
delighted
to
observe
the
snowy
tops
of
the
mountains
under
the
passing
influence
of
the
day
blushing
with
morning
glowing
with
the
brightness
of
noon
or
just
tinted
with
the
purple
evening
the
haunt
of
man
could
now
only
be
discovered
by
the
simple
hut
of
the
shepherd
and
the
hunter
or
by
the
rough
pine
bridge
thrown
across
the
torrent
to
assist
the
latter
in
his
chase
of
the
chamois
over
crags
where
but
for
this
vestige
of
man
it
would
have
been
believed
only
the
chamois
or
the
wolf
dared
to
venture
as
emily
gazed
upon
one
of
these
perilous
bridges
with
the
cataract
foaming
beneath
it
some
images
came
to
her
mind
which
she
afterwards
combined
in
the
following
storied
sonnet
the
weary
traveller
who
all
night
long
has
climbâ€™d
among
the
alpsâ€™
tremendous
steeps
skirting
the
pathless
precipice
where
throng
wild
forms
of
danger
as
he
onward
creeps
if
chance
his
anxious
eye
at
distance
sees
the
mountain-shepherdâ€™s
solitary
home
peeping
from
forth
the
moon-illuminâ€™d
trees
what
sudden
transports
to
his
bosom
come
but
if
between
some
hideous
chasm
yawn
where
the
cleft
pine
a
doubtful
bridge
displays
in
dreadful
silence
on
the
brink
forlorn
he
stands
and
views
in
the
faint
rays
far
far
below
the
torrentâ€™s
rising
surge
and
listens
to
the
wild
impetuous
roar
still
eyes
the
depth
still
shudders
on
the
verge
fears
to
return
nor
dares
to
venture
oâ€™er
desperate
at
length
the
tottering
plank
he
tries
his
weak
steps
slide
he
shrieks
he
sinksâ€”he
dies
emily
often
as
she
travelled
among
the
clouds
watched
in
silent
awe
their
billowy
surges
rolling
below
sometimes
wholly
closing
upon
the
scene
they
appeared
like
a
world
of
chaos
and
at
others
spreading
thinly
they
opened
and
admitted
partial
catches
of
the
landscapeâ€”the
torrent
whose
astounding
roar
had
never
failed
tumbling
down
the
rocky
chasm
huge
cliffs
white
with
snow
or
the
dark
summits
of
the
pine
forests
that
stretched
mid-way
down
the
mountains
but
who
may
describe
her
rapture
when
having
passed
through
a
sea
of
vapour
she
caught
a
first
view
of
italy
when
from
the
ridge
of
one
of
those
tremendous
precipices
that
hang
upon
mount
cenis
and
guard
the
entrance
of
that
enchanting
country
she
looked
down
through
the
lower
clouds
and
as
they
floated
away
saw
the
grassy
vales
of
piedmont
at
her
feet
and
beyond
the
plains
of
lombardy
extending
to
the
farthest
distance
at
which
appeared
on
the
faint
horizon
the
doubtful
towers
of
turin
the
solitary
grandeur
of
the
objects
that
immediately
surrounded
her
the
mountain-region
towering
above
the
deep
precipices
that
fell
beneath
the
waving
blackness
of
the
forests
of
pine
and
oak
which
skirted
their
feet
or
hung
within
their
recesses
the
headlong
torrents
that
dashing
among
their
cliffs
sometimes
appeared
like
a
cloud
of
mist
at
others
like
a
sheet
of
iceâ€”these
were
features
which
received
a
higher
character
of
sublimity
from
the
reposing
beauty
of
the
italian
landscape
below
stretching
to
the
wide
horizon
where
the
same
melting
blue
tint
seemed
to
unite
earth
and
sky
madame
montoni
only
shuddered
as
she
looked
down
precipices
near
whose
edge
the
chairmen
trotted
lightly
and
swiftly
almost
as
the
chamois
bounded
and
from
which
emily
too
recoiled
but
with
her
fears
were
mingled
such
various
emotions
of
delight
such
admiration
astonishment
and
awe
as
she
had
never
experienced
before
meanwhile
the
carriers
having
come
to
a
landing-place
stopped
to
rest
and
the
travellers
being
seated
on
the
point
of
a
cliff
montoni
and
cavigni
renewed
a
dispute
concerning
hannibalâ€™s
passage
over
the
alps
montoni
contending
that
he
entered
italy
by
way
of
mount
cenis
and
cavigni
that
he
passed
over
mount
st
bernard
the
subject
brought
to
emilyâ€™s
imagination
the
disasters
he
had
suffered
in
this
bold
and
perilous
adventure
she
saw
his
vast
armies
winding
among
the
defiles
and
over
the
tremendous
cliffs
of
the
mountains
which
at
night
were
lighted
up
by
his
fires
or
by
the
torches
which
he
caused
to
be
carried
when
he
pursued
his
indefatigable
march
in
the
eye
of
fancy
she
perceived
the
gleam
of
arms
through
the
duskiness
of
night
the
glitter
of
spears
and
helmets
and
the
banners
floating
dimly
on
the
twilight
while
now
and
then
the
blast
of
a
distant
trumpet
echoed
along
the
defile
and
the
signal
was
answered
by
a
momentary
clash
of
arms
she
looked
with
horror
upon
the
mountaineers
perched
on
the
higher
cliffs
assailing
the
troops
below
with
broken
fragments
of
the
mountain
on
soldiers
and
elephants
tumbling
headlong
down
the
lower
precipices
and
as
she
listened
to
the
rebounding
rocks
that
followed
their
fall
the
terrors
of
fancy
yielded
to
those
of
reality
and
she
shuddered
to
behold
herself
on
the
dizzy
height
whence
she
had
pictured
the
descent
of
others
madame
montoni
meantime
as
she
looked
upon
italy
was
contemplating
in
imagination
the
splendour
of
palaces
and
the
grandeur
of
castles
such
as
she
believed
she
was
going
to
be
mistress
of
at
venice
and
in
the
apennine
and
she
became
in
idea
little
less
than
a
princess
being
no
longer
under
the
alarms
which
had
deterred
her
from
giving
entertainments
to
the
beauties
of
thoulouse
whom
montoni
had
mentioned
with
more
eclã¢t
to
his
own
vanity
than
credit
to
their
discretion
or
regard
to
truth
she
determined
to
give
concerts
though
she
had
neither
ear
nor
taste
for
music
conversazione
though
she
had
no
talents
for
conversation
and
to
outvie
if
possible
in
the
gaieties
of
her
parties
and
the
magnificence
of
her
liveries
all
the
noblesse
of
venice
this
blissful
reverie
was
somewhat
obscured
when
she
recollected
the
signor
her
husband
who
though
he
was
not
averse
to
the
profit
which
sometimes
results
from
such
parties
had
always
shown
a
contempt
of
the
frivolous
parade
that
sometimes
attends
them
till
she
considered
that
his
pride
might
be
gratified
by
displaying
among
his
own
friends
in
his
native
city
the
wealth
which
he
had
neglected
in
france
and
she
courted
again
the
splendid
illusions
that
had
charmed
her
before
the
travellers
as
they
descended
gradually
exchanged
the
region
of
winter
for
the
genial
warmth
and
beauty
of
spring
the
sky
began
to
assume
that
serene
and
beautiful
tint
peculiar
to
the
climate
of
italy
patches
of
young
verdure
fragrant
shrubs
and
flowers
looked
gaily
among
the
rocks
often
fringing
their
rugged
brows
or
hanging
in
tufts
from
their
broken
sides
and
the
buds
of
the
oak
and
mountain
ash
were
expanding
into
foliage
descending
lower
the
orange
and
the
myrtle
every
now
and
then
appeared
in
some
sunny
nook
with
their
yellow
blossoms
peeping
from
among
the
dark
green
of
their
leaves
and
mingling
with
the
scarlet
flowers
of
the
pomegranate
and
the
paler
ones
of
the
arbutus
that
ran
mantling
to
the
crags
above
while
lower
still
spread
the
pastures
of
piedmont
where
early
flocks
were
cropping
the
luxuriant
herbage
of
spring
the
river
doria
which
rising
on
the
summit
of
mount
cenis
had
dashed
for
many
leagues
over
the
precipices
that
bordered
the
road
now
began
to
assume
a
less
impetuous
though
scarcely
less
romantic
character
as
it
approached
the
green
valleys
of
piedmont
into
which
the
travellers
descended
with
the
evening
sun
and
emily
found
herself
once
more
amid
the
tranquil
beauty
of
pastoral
scenery
among
flocks
and
herds
and
slopes
tufted
with
woods
of
lively
verdure
and
with
beautiful
shrubs
such
as
she
had
often
seen
waving
luxuriantly
over
the
alps
above
the
verdure
of
the
pasturage
now
varied
with
the
hues
of
early
flowers
among
which
were
yellow
ranunculuses
and
pansey
violets
of
delicious
fragrance
she
had
never
seen
excelledâ€”emily
almost
wished
to
become
a
peasant
of
piedmont
to
inhabit
one
of
the
pleasant
embowered
cottages
which
she
saw
peeping
beneath
the
cliffs
and
to
pass
her
careless
hours
among
these
romantic
landscapes
to
the
hours
the
months
she
was
to
pass
under
the
dominion
of
montoni
she
looked
with
apprehension
while
those
which
were
departed
she
remembered
with
regret
and
sorrow
in
the
present
scenes
her
fancy
often
gave
her
the
figure
of
valancourt
whom
she
saw
on
a
point
of
the
cliffs
gazing
with
awe
and
admiration
on
the
imagery
around
him
or
wandering
pensively
along
the
vale
below
frequently
pausing
to
look
back
upon
the
scenery
and
then
his
countenance
glowing
with
the
poetâ€™s
fire
pursuing
his
way
to
some
overhanging
heights
when
she
again
considered
the
time
and
the
distance
that
were
to
separate
them
that
every
step
she
now
took
lengthened
this
distance
her
heart
sunk
and
the
surrounding
landscape
charmed
her
no
more
the
travellers
passing
novalesa
reached
after
the
evening
had
closed
the
small
and
ancient
town
of
susa
which
had
formerly
guarded
this
pass
of
the
alps
into
piedmont
the
heights
which
command
it
had
since
the
invention
of
artillery
rendered
its
fortifications
useless
but
these
romantic
heights
seen
by
moonlight
with
the
town
below
surrounded
by
its
walls
and
watchtowers
and
partially
illumined
exhibited
an
interesting
picture
to
emily
here
they
rested
for
the
night
at
an
inn
which
had
little
accommodation
to
boast
of
but
the
travellers
brought
with
them
the
hunger
that
gives
delicious
flavour
to
the
coarsest
viands
and
the
weariness
that
ensures
repose
and
here
emily
first
caught
a
strain
of
italian
music
on
italian
ground
as
she
sat
after
supper
at
a
little
window
that
opened
upon
the
country
observing
an
effect
of
the
moonlight
on
the
broken
surface
of
the
mountains
and
remembering
that
on
such
a
night
as
this
she
once
had
sat
with
her
father
and
valancourt
resting
upon
a
cliff
of
the
pyrenees
she
heard
from
below
the
long-drawn
notes
of
a
violin
of
such
tone
and
delicacy
of
expression
as
harmonised
exactly
with
the
tender
emotions
she
was
indulging
and
both
charmed
and
surprised
her
cavigni
who
approached
the
window
smiled
at
her
surprise
â€œthis
is
nothing
extraordinaryâ€
said
he
â€œyou
will
hear
the
same
perhaps
at
every
inn
on
our
way
it
is
one
of
our
landlordâ€™s
family
who
plays
i
doubt
notâ€
emily
as
she
listened
thought
he
could
be
scarcely
less
than
a
professor
of
music
whom
she
heard
and
the
sweet
and
plaintive
strains
soon
lulled
her
into
a
reverie
from
which
she
was
very
unwillingly
roused
by
the
raillery
of
cavigni
and
by
the
voice
of
montoni
who
gave
orders
to
a
servant
to
have
the
carriages
ready
at
an
early
hour
on
the
following
morning
and
added
that
he
meant
to
dine
at
turin
madame
montoni
was
exceedingly
rejoiced
to
be
once
more
on
level
ground
and
after
giving
a
long
detail
of
the
various
terrors
she
had
suffered
which
she
forgot
that
she
was
describing
to
the
companions
of
her
dangers
she
added
a
hope
that
she
should
soon
be
beyond
the
view
of
these
horrid
mountains
â€œwhich
all
the
worldâ€
said
she
â€œshould
not
tempt
me
to
cross
againâ€
complaining
of
fatigue
she
soon
retired
to
rest
and
emily
withdrew
to
her
own
room
when
she
understood
from
annette
her
auntâ€™s
woman
that
cavigni
was
nearly
right
in
his
conjecture
concerning
the
musician
who
had
awakened
the
violin
with
so
much
taste
for
that
he
was
the
son
of
a
peasant
inhabiting
the
neighbouring
valley
â€œhe
is
going
to
the
carnival
at
veniceâ€
added
annette
â€œfor
they
say
he
has
a
fine
hand
at
playing
and
will
get
a
world
of
money
and
the
carnival
is
just
going
to
begin
but
for
my
part
i
should
like
to
live
among
these
pleasant
woods
and
hills
better
than
in
a
town
and
they
say
maâ€™amselle
we
shall
see
no
woods
or
hills
or
fields
at
venice
for
that
it
is
built
in
the
very
middle
of
the
seaâ€
emily
agreed
with
the
talkative
annette
that
this
young
man
was
making
a
change
for
the
worse
and
could
not
forbear
silently
lamenting
that
he
should
be
drawn
from
the
innocence
and
beauty
of
these
scenes
to
the
corrupt
ones
of
that
voluptuous
city
when
she
was
alone
unable
to
sleep
the
landscapes
of
her
native
home
with
valancourt
and
the
circumstances
of
her
departure
haunted
her
fancy
she
drew
pictures
of
social
happiness
amidst
the
grand
simplicity
of
nature
such
as
she
feared
she
had
bade
farewell
to
for
ever
and
then
the
idea
of
this
young
piedmontese
thus
ignorantly
sporting
with
his
happiness
returned
to
her
thoughts
and
glad
to
escape
a
while
from
the
pressure
of
nearer
interests
she
indulged
her
fancy
in
composing
the
following
lines
the
piedmontese
ah
merry
swain
who
laughâ€™d
along
the
vales
and
with
your
gay
pipe
made
the
mountains
ring
why
leave
your
cot
your
woods
and
thymy
gales
and
friends
belovâ€™d
for
aught
that
wealth
can
bring
he
goes
to
wake
oâ€™er
moonlight
seas
the
string
venetian
gold
his
untaught
fancy
hails
yet
oft
of
home
his
simple
carols
sing
and
his
steps
pause
as
the
last
alp
he
scales
once
more
he
turns
to
view
his
native
sceneâ€”
far
far
below
as
roll
the
clouds
away
he
spies
his
cabin
â€™mid
the
pine-tops
green
the
well-known
woods
clear
brook
and
pastures
gay
and
thinks
of
friends
and
parents
left
behind
of
sylvan
revels
dance
and
festive
song
and
hears
the
faint
reed
swelling
in
the
wind
and
his
sad
sighs
the
distant
notes
prolong
thus
went
the
swain
till
mountain-shadows
fell
and
dimmâ€™d
the
landscape
to
his
aching
sight
and
must
he
leave
the
vales
he
loves
so
well
can
foreign
wealth
and
shows
his
heart
delight
no
happy
vales
your
wild
rocks
still
shall
hear
his
pipe
light
sounding
on
the
morning
breeze
still
shall
he
lead
the
flocks
to
streamlet
clear
and
watch
at
eve
beneath
the
western
trees
away
venetian
goldâ€”your
charm
is
oâ€™er
and
now
his
swift
step
seeks
the
lowland
bowâ€™rs
where
through
the
leaves
his
cottage
light
once
more
guides
him
to
happy
friends
and
jocund
hours
ah
merry
swain
that
laugh
along
the
vales
and
with
your
gay
pipe
make
the
mountains
ring
your
cot
your
woods
your
thymy-scented
galesâ€”
and
friends
belovâ€™d
more
joy
than
wealth
can
bring
titania
if
you
will
patiently
dance
in
our
round
and
see
our
moonlight
revels
go
with
us
midsummer
nightâ€™s
dream
early
on
the
following
morning
the
travellers
set
out
for
turin
the
luxuriant
plain
that
extends
from
the
feet
of
the
alps
to
that
magnificent
city
was
not
then
as
now
shaded
by
an
avenue
of
trees
nine
miles
in
length
but
plantations
of
olives
mulberry
and
palms
festooned
with
vines
mingled
with
the
pastoral
scenery
through
with
the
rapid
po
after
its
descent
from
the
mountains
wandered
to
meet
the
humble
doria
at
turin
as
they
advanced
towards
this
city
the
alps
seen
at
some
distance
began
to
appear
in
all
their
awful
sublimity
chain
rising
over
chain
in
long
succession
their
higher
points
darkened
by
the
hovering
clouds
sometimes
hid
and
at
others
seen
shooting
up
far
above
them
while
their
lower
steeps
broken
into
fantastic
forms
were
touched
with
blue
and
purplish
tints
which
as
they
changed
in
light
and
shade
seemed
to
open
new
scenes
to
the
eye
to
the
east
stretched
the
plains
of
lombardy
with
the
towers
of
turin
rising
at
a
distance
and
beyond
the
apennines
bounding
the
horizon
the
general
magnificence
of
that
city
with
its
vistas
of
churches
and
palaces
branching
from
the
grand
square
each
opening
to
a
landscape
of
the
distant
alps
or
apennines
was
not
only
such
as
emily
had
never
seen
in
france
but
such
as
she
had
never
imagined
montoni
who
had
been
often
at
turin
and
cared
little
about
views
of
any
kind
did
not
comply
with
his
wifeâ€™s
request
that
they
might
survey
some
of
the
palaces
but
staying
only
till
the
necessary
refreshments
could
be
obtained
they
set
forward
for
venice
with
all
possible
rapidity
montoniâ€™s
manner
during
this
journey
was
grave
and
even
haughty
and
towards
madame
montoni
he
was
more
especially
reserved
but
it
was
not
the
reserve
of
respect
so
much
as
of
pride
and
discontent
of
emily
he
took
little
notice
with
cavigni
his
conversations
were
commonly
on
political
or
military
topics
such
as
the
convulsed
state
of
their
country
rendered
at
this
time
particularly
interesting
emily
observed
that
at
the
mention
of
any
daring
exploit
montoniâ€™s
eyes
lost
their
sullenness
and
seemed
instantaneously
to
gleam
with
fire
yet
they
still
retained
somewhat
of
a
lurking
cunning
and
she
sometimes
thought
that
their
fire
partook
more
of
the
glare
of
malice
than
the
brightness
of
valour
though
the
latter
would
well
have
harmonised
with
the
high
chivalric
air
of
his
figure
in
which
cavigni
with
all
his
gay
and
gallant
manners
was
his
inferior
on
entering
the
milanese
the
gentlemen
exchanged
their
french
hats
for
the
italian
cap
of
scarlet
cloth
embroidered
and
emily
was
somewhat
surprised
to
observe
that
montoni
added
to
his
the
military
plume
while
cavigni
retained
only
the
feather
which
was
usually
worn
with
such
caps
but
she
at
length
concluded
that
montoni
assumed
this
ensign
of
a
soldier
for
convenience
as
a
means
of
passing
with
more
safety
through
a
country
over-run
with
parties
of
the
military
over
the
beautiful
plains
of
this
country
the
devastations
of
war
were
frequently
visible
where
the
lands
had
not
been
suffered
to
lie
uncultivated
they
were
often
tracked
with
the
steps
of
the
spoiler
the
vines
were
torn
down
from
the
branches
that
had
supported
them
the
olives
trampled
upon
the
ground
and
even
the
groves
of
mulberry
trees
had
been
hewn
by
the
enemy
to
light
fires
that
destroyed
the
hamlets
and
villages
of
their
owners
emily
turned
her
eyes
with
a
sigh
from
these
painful
vestiges
of
contention
to
the
alps
of
the
grison
that
overlooked
them
to
the
north
whose
awful
solitudes
seemed
to
offer
to
persecuted
man
a
secure
asylum
the
travellers
frequently
distinguished
troops
of
soldiers
moving
at
a
distance
and
they
experienced
at
the
little
inns
on
the
road
the
scarcity
of
provision
and
other
inconveniences
which
are
a
part
of
the
consequence
of
intestine
war
but
they
had
never
reason
to
be
much
alarmed
for
their
immediate
safety
and
they
passed
on
to
milan
with
little
interruption
of
any
kind
where
they
staid
not
to
survey
the
grandeur
of
the
city
or
even
to
view
its
vast
cathedral
which
was
then
building
beyond
milan
the
country
wore
the
aspect
of
a
ruder
devastation
and
though
everything
seemed
now
quiet
the
repose
was
like
that
of
death
spread
over
features
which
retain
the
impression
of
the
last
convulsions
it
was
not
till
they
had
passed
the
eastern
limits
of
the
milanese
that
the
travellers
saw
any
troops
since
they
had
left
milan
when
as
the
evening
was
drawing
to
a
close
they
descried
what
appeared
to
be
an
army
winding
onward
along
the
distant
plains
whose
spears
and
other
arms
caught
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
as
the
column
advanced
through
a
part
of
the
road
contracted
between
two
hillocks
some
of
the
commanders
on
horseback
were
distinguished
on
a
small
eminence
pointing
and
making
signals
for
the
march
while
several
of
the
officers
were
riding
along
the
line
directing
its
progress
according
to
the
signs
communicated
by
those
above
and
others
separating
from
the
vanguard
which
had
emerged
from
the
pass
were
riding
carelessly
along
the
plains
at
some
distance
to
the
right
of
the
army
as
they
drew
nearer
montoni
distinguishing
the
feathers
that
waved
in
their
caps
and
the
banners
and
liveries
of
the
bands
that
followed
them
thought
he
knew
this
to
be
the
small
army
commanded
by
the
famous
captain
utaldo
with
whom
as
well
as
with
some
of
the
other
chiefs
he
was
personally
acquainted
he
therefore
gave
orders
that
the
carriages
should
draw
up
by
the
side
of
the
road
to
await
their
arrival
and
give
them
the
pass
a
faint
strain
of
martial
music
now
stole
by
and
gradually
strengthening
as
the
troops
approached
emily
distinguished
the
drums
and
trumpets
with
the
clash
of
cymbals
and
of
arms
that
were
struck
by
a
small
party
in
time
to
the
march
montoni
being
now
certain
that
these
were
the
bands
of
the
victorious
utaldo
leaned
from
the
carriage
window
and
hailed
their
general
by
waving
his
cap
in
the
air
which
compliment
the
chief
returned
by
raising
his
spear
and
then
letting
it
down
again
suddenly
while
some
of
his
officers
who
were
riding
at
a
distance
from
the
troops
came
up
to
the
carriage
and
saluted
montoni
as
an
old
acquaintance
the
captain
himself
soon
after
arriving
his
bands
halted
while
he
conversed
with
montoni
whom
he
appeared
much
rejoiced
to
see
and
from
what
he
said
emily
understood
that
this
was
a
victorious
army
returning
into
their
own
principality
while
the
numerous
waggons
that
accompanied
them
contained
the
rich
spoils
of
the
enemy
their
own
wounded
soldiers
and
the
prisoners
they
had
taken
in
battle
who
were
to
be
ransomed
when
the
peace
then
negociating
between
the
neighbouring
states
should
be
ratified
the
chiefs
on
the
following
day
were
to
separate
and
each
taking
his
share
of
the
spoil
was
to
return
with
his
own
band
to
his
castle
this
was
therefore
to
be
an
evening
of
uncommon
and
general
festivity
in
commemoration
of
the
victory
they
had
accomplished
together
and
of
the
farewell
which
the
commanders
were
about
to
take
of
each
other
emily
as
these
officers
conversed
with
montoni
observed
with
admiration
tinctured
with
awe
their
high
martial
air
mingled
with
the
haughtiness
of
the
noblesse
of
those
days
and
heightened
by
the
gallantry
of
their
dress
by
the
plumes
towering
on
their
caps
the
armorial
coat
persian
sash
and
ancient
spanish
cloak
utaldo
telling
montoni
that
his
army
were
going
to
encamp
for
the
night
near
a
village
at
only
a
few
miles
distance
invited
him
to
turn
back
and
partake
of
their
festivity
assuring
the
ladies
also
that
they
should
be
pleasantly
accommodated
but
montoni
excused
himself
adding
that
it
was
his
design
to
reach
verona
that
evening
and
after
some
conversation
concerning
the
state
of
the
country
towards
that
city
they
parted
the
travellers
proceeded
without
any
interruption
but
it
was
some
hours
after
sunset
before
they
arrived
at
verona
whose
beautiful
environs
were
therefore
not
seen
by
emily
till
the
following
morning
when
leaving
that
pleasant
town
at
an
early
hour
they
set
off
for
padua
where
they
embarked
on
the
brenta
for
venice
here
the
scene
was
entirely
changed
no
vestiges
of
war
such
as
had
deformed
the
plains
of
the
milanese
appeared
on
the
contrary
all
was
peace
and
elegance
the
verdant
banks
of
the
brenta
exhibited
a
continued
landscape
of
beauty
gaiety
and
splendour
emily
gazed
with
admiration
on
the
villas
of
the
venetian
noblesse
with
their
cool
porticos
and
colonnades
overhung
with
poplars
and
cypresses
of
majestic
height
and
lively
verdure
on
their
rich
orangeries
whose
blossoms
perfumed
the
air
and
on
the
luxuriant
willows
that
dipped
their
light
leaves
in
the
wave
and
sheltered
from
the
sun
the
gay
parties
whose
music
came
at
intervals
on
the
breeze
the
carnival
did
indeed
appear
to
extend
from
venice
along
the
whole
line
of
these
enchanting
shores
the
river
was
gay
with
boats
passing
to
that
city
exhibiting
the
fantastic
diversity
of
a
masquerade
in
the
dresses
of
the
people
within
them
and
towards
evening
groups
of
dancers
frequently
were
seen
beneath
the
trees
cavigni
meanwhile
informed
her
of
the
names
of
the
noblemen
to
whom
the
several
villas
they
passed
belonged
adding
light
sketches
of
their
characters
such
as
served
to
amuse
rather
than
to
inform
exhibiting
his
own
wit
instead
of
the
delineation
of
truth
emily
was
sometimes
diverted
by
his
conversation
but
his
gaiety
did
not
entertain
madame
montoni
as
it
had
formerly
done
she
was
frequently
grave
and
montoni
retained
his
usual
reserve
nothing
could
exceed
emilyâ€™s
admiration
on
her
first
view
of
venice
with
its
islets
palaces
and
towers
rising
out
of
the
sea
whose
clear
surface
reflected
the
tremulous
picture
in
all
its
colours
the
sun
sinking
in
the
west
tinted
the
waves
and
the
lofty
mountains
of
friuli
which
skirt
the
northern
shores
of
the
adriatic
with
a
saffron
glow
while
on
the
marble
porticos
and
colonnades
of
st
mark
were
thrown
the
rich
lights
and
shades
of
evening
as
they
glided
on
the
grander
features
of
this
city
appeared
more
distinctly
its
terraces
crowned
with
airy
yet
majestic
fabrics
touched
as
they
now
were
with
the
splendour
of
the
setting
sun
appeared
as
if
they
had
been
called
up
from
the
ocean
by
the
wand
of
an
enchanter
rather
than
reared
by
mortal
hands
the
sun
soon
after
sinking
to
the
lower
world
the
shadow
of
the
earth
stole
gradually
over
the
waves
and
then
up
the
towering
sides
of
the
mountains
of
friuli
till
it
extinguished
even
the
last
upward
beams
that
had
lingered
on
their
summits
and
the
melancholy
purple
of
evening
drew
over
them
like
a
thin
veil
how
deep
how
beautiful
was
the
tranquillity
that
wrapped
the
scene
all
nature
seemed
to
repose
the
finest
emotions
of
the
soul
were
alone
awake
emilyâ€™s
eyes
filled
with
tears
of
admiration
and
sublime
devotion
as
she
raised
them
over
the
sleeping
world
to
the
vast
heavens
and
heard
the
notes
of
solemn
music
that
stole
over
the
waters
from
a
distance
she
listened
in
still
rapture
and
no
person
of
the
party
broke
the
charm
by
an
enquiry
the
sounds
seemed
to
grow
on
the
air
for
so
smoothly
did
the
barge
glide
along
that
its
motion
was
not
perceivable
and
the
fairy
city
appeared
approaching
to
welcome
the
strangers
they
now
distinguished
a
female
voice
accompanied
by
a
few
instruments
singing
a
soft
and
mournful
air
and
its
fine
expression
as
sometimes
it
seemed
pleading
with
the
impassioned
tenderness
of
love
and
then
languishing
into
the
cadence
of
hopeless
grief
declared
that
it
flowed
from
no
feigned
sensibility
ah
thought
emily
as
she
sighed
and
remembered
valancourt
those
strains
come
from
the
heart
she
looked
round
with
anxious
enquiry
the
deep
twilight
that
had
fallen
over
the
scene
admitted
only
imperfect
images
to
the
eye
but
at
some
distance
on
the
sea
she
thought
she
perceived
a
gondola
a
chorus
of
voices
and
instruments
now
swelled
on
the
airâ€”so
sweet
so
solemn
it
seemed
like
the
hymn
of
angels
descending
through
the
silence
of
night
now
it
died
away
and
fancy
almost
beheld
the
holy
choir
reascending
towards
heaven
then
again
it
swelled
with
the
breeze
trembled
awhile
and
again
died
into
silence
it
brought
to
emilyâ€™s
recollection
some
lines
of
her
late
father
and
she
repeated
in
a
low
voice
oft
i
hear
upon
the
silence
of
the
midnight
air
celestial
voices
swell
in
holy
chorus
that
bears
the
soul
to
heaven
the
deep
stillness
that
succeeded
was
as
expressive
as
the
strain
that
had
just
ceased
it
was
uninterrupted
for
several
minutes
till
a
general
sigh
seemed
to
release
the
company
from
their
enchantment
emily
however
long
indulged
the
pleasing
sadness
that
had
stolen
upon
her
spirits
but
the
gay
and
busy
scene
that
appeared
as
the
barge
approached
st
markâ€™s
place
at
length
roused
her
attention
the
rising
moon
which
threw
a
shadowy
light
upon
the
terraces
and
illumined
the
porticos
and
magnificent
arcades
that
crowned
them
discovered
the
various
company
whose
light
steps
soft
guitars
and
softer
voices
echoed
through
the
colonnades
the
music
they
heard
before
now
passed
montoniâ€™s
barge
in
one
of
the
gondolas
of
which
several
were
seen
skimming
along
the
moonlight
sea
full
of
gay
parties
catching
the
cool
breeze
most
of
these
had
music
made
sweeter
by
the
waves
over
which
it
floated
and
by
the
measured
sound
of
oars
as
they
dashed
the
sparkling
tide
emily
gazed
and
listened
and
thought
herself
in
a
fairy
scene
even
madame
montoni
was
pleased
montoni
congratulated
himself
on
his
return
to
venice
which
he
called
the
first
city
in
the
world
and
cavigni
was
more
gay
and
animated
than
ever
the
barge
passed
on
to
the
grand
canal
where
montoniâ€™s
mansion
was
situated
and
here
other
forms
of
beauty
and
of
grandeur
such
as
her
imagination
had
never
painted
were
unfolded
to
emily
in
the
palaces
of
sansovino
and
palladio
as
she
glided
along
the
waves
the
air
bore
no
sounds
but
those
of
sweetness
echoing
along
each
margin
of
the
canal
and
from
gondolas
on
its
surface
while
groups
of
masks
were
seen
dancing
on
the
moonlight
terraces
and
seemed
almost
to
realise
the
romance
of
fairyland
the
barge
stopped
before
the
portico
of
a
large
house
from
whence
a
servant
of
montoni
crossed
the
terrace
and
immediately
the
party
disembarked
from
the
portico
they
passed
a
noble
hall
to
a
staircase
of
marble
which
led
to
a
saloon
fitted
up
in
a
style
of
magnificence
that
surprised
emily
the
walls
and
ceilings
were
adorned
with
historical
and
allegorical
paintings
in
fresco
silver
tripods
depending
from
chains
of
the
same
metal
illumined
the
apartment
the
floor
of
which
was
covered
with
indian
mats
painted
in
a
variety
of
colours
and
devices
the
couches
and
drapery
of
the
lattices
were
of
pale
green
silk
embroidered
and
fringed
with
green
and
gold
balcony
lattices
opened
upon
the
grand
canal
whence
rose
a
confusion
of
voices
and
of
musical
instruments
and
the
breeze
that
gave
freshness
to
the
apartment
emily
considering
the
gloomy
temper
of
montoni
looked
upon
the
splendid
furniture
of
this
house
with
surprise
and
remembered
the
report
of
his
being
a
man
of
broken
fortune
with
astonishment
â€œahâ€
said
she
to
herself
â€œif
valancourt
could
but
see
this
mansion
what
peace
would
it
give
him
he
would
then
be
convinced
that
the
report
was
groundlessâ€
madame
montoni
seemed
to
assume
the
air
of
a
princess
but
montoni
was
restless
and
discontented
and
did
not
even
observe
the
civility
of
bidding
her
welcome
to
her
home
soon
after
his
arrival
he
ordered
his
gondola
and
with
cavigni
went
out
to
mingle
in
the
scenes
of
the
evening
madame
then
became
serious
and
thoughtful
emily
who
was
charmed
with
everything
she
saw
endeavoured
to
enliven
her
but
reflection
had
not
with
madame
montoni
subdued
caprice
and
ill-humour
and
her
answers
discovered
so
much
of
both
that
emily
gave
up
the
attempt
of
diverting
her
and
withdrew
to
a
lattice
to
amuse
herself
with
the
scene
without
so
new
and
so
enchanting
the
first
object
that
attracted
her
notice
was
a
group
of
dancers
on
the
terrace
below
led
by
a
guitar
and
some
other
instruments
the
girl
who
struck
the
guitar
and
another
who
flourished
a
tambourine
passed
on
in
a
dancing
step
and
with
a
light
grace
and
gaiety
of
heart
that
would
have
subdued
the
goddess
of
spleen
in
her
worst
humour
after
these
came
a
group
of
fantastic
figures
some
dressed
as
gondolieri
others
as
minstrels
while
others
seemed
to
defy
all
description
they
sung
in
parts
their
voices
accompanied
by
a
few
soft
instruments
at
a
little
distance
from
the
portico
they
stopped
and
emily
distinguished
the
verses
of
ariosto
they
sung
of
the
wars
of
the
moors
against
charlemagne
and
then
of
the
woes
of
orlando
afterwards
the
measure
changed
and
the
melancholy
sweetness
of
petrarch
succeeded
the
magic
of
his
grief
was
assisted
by
all
that
italian
music
and
italian
expression
heightened
by
the
enchantments
of
venetian
moonlight
could
give
emily
as
she
listened
caught
the
pensive
enthusiasm
her
tears
flowed
silently
while
her
fancy
bore
her
far
away
to
france
and
to
valancourt
each
succeeding
sonnet
more
full
of
charming
sadness
than
the
last
seemed
to
bind
the
spell
of
melancholy
with
extreme
regret
she
saw
the
musicians
move
on
and
her
attention
followed
the
strain
till
the
last
faint
warble
died
in
air
she
then
remained
sunk
in
that
pensive
tranquillity
which
soft
music
leaves
on
the
mindâ€”a
state
like
that
produced
by
the
view
of
a
beautiful
landscape
by
moonlight
or
by
the
recollection
of
scenes
marked
with
the
tenderness
of
friends
lost
for
ever
and
with
sorrows
which
time
has
mellowed
into
mild
regret
such
scenes
are
indeed
to
the
mind
like
â€œthose
faint
traces
which
the
memory
bears
of
music
that
is
pastâ€
other
sounds
soon
awakened
her
attention
it
was
the
solemn
harmony
of
horns
that
swelled
from
a
distance
and
observing
the
gondolas
arrange
themselves
along
the
margin
of
the
terraces
she
threw
on
her
veil
and
stepping
into
the
balcony
discerned
in
the
distant
perspective
of
the
canal
something
like
a
procession
floating
on
the
light
surface
of
the
water
as
it
approached
the
horns
and
other
instruments
mingled
sweetly
and
soon
after
the
fabled
deities
of
the
city
seemed
to
have
arisen
from
the
ocean
for
neptune
with
venice
personified
as
his
queen
came
on
the
undulating
waves
surrounded
by
tritons
and
sea-nymphs
the
fantastic
splendour
of
this
spectacle
together
with
the
grandeur
of
the
surrounding
palaces
appeared
like
the
vision
of
a
poet
suddenly
embodied
and
the
fanciful
images
which
it
awakened
in
emilyâ€™s
mind
lingered
there
long
after
the
procession
had
passed
away
she
indulged
herself
in
imagining
what
might
be
the
manners
and
delights
of
a
sea-nymph
till
she
almost
wished
to
throw
off
the
habit
of
mortality
and
plunge
into
the
green
wave
to
participate
them
â€œhow
delightfulâ€
said
she
â€œto
live
amidst
the
coral
bowers
and
crystal
caverns
of
the
ocean
with
my
sister
nymphs
and
listen
to
the
sounding
waters
above
and
to
the
soft
shells
of
the
tritons
and
then
after
sunset
to
skim
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
round
wild
rocks
and
along
sequestered
shores
where
perhaps
some
pensive
wanderer
comes
to
weep
then
would
i
soothe
his
sorrows
with
my
sweet
music
and
offer
him
from
a
shell
some
of
the
delicious
fruit
that
hangs
round
neptuneâ€™s
palaceâ€
she
was
recalled
from
her
reverie
to
a
mere
mortal
supper
and
could
not
forbear
smiling
at
the
fancies
she
had
been
indulging
and
at
her
conviction
of
the
serious
displeasure
which
madame
montoni
would
have
expressed
could
she
have
been
made
acquainted
with
them
after
supper
her
aunt
sat
late
but
montoni
did
not
return
and
she
at
length
retired
to
rest
if
emily
had
admired
the
magnificence
of
the
saloon
she
was
not
less
surprised
on
observing
the
half-furnished
and
forlorn
appearance
of
the
apartments
she
passed
in
the
way
to
her
chamber
whither
she
went
through
long
suites
of
noble
rooms
that
seemed
from
their
desolate
aspect
to
have
been
unoccupied
for
many
years
on
the
walls
of
some
were
the
faded
remains
of
tapestry
from
others
painted
in
fresco
the
damps
had
almost
withdrawn
both
colours
and
design
at
length
she
reached
her
own
chamber
spacious
desolate
and
lofty
like
the
rest
with
high
lattices
that
opened
towards
the
adriatic
it
brought
gloomy
images
to
her
mind
but
the
view
of
the
adriatic
soon
gave
her
others
more
airy
among
which
was
that
of
the
sea-nymph
whose
delights
she
had
before
amused
herself
with
picturing
and
anxious
to
escape
from
serious
reflections
she
now
endeavoured
to
throw
her
fanciful
ideas
into
a
train
and
concluded
the
hour
with
composing
the
following
lines
the
sea-nymph
down
down
a
thousand
fathom
deep
among
the
sounding
seas
i
go
play
round
the
foot
of
evâ€™ry
steep
whose
cliffs
above
the
ocean
grow
there
within
their
secret
cares
i
hear
the
mighty
rivers
roar
and
guide
their
streams
through
neptuneâ€™s
waves
to
bless
the
green
earthâ€™s
inmost
shore
and
bid
the
freshenâ€™d
waters
glide
for
fern-crownâ€™d
nymphs
of
lake
or
brook
through
winding
woods
and
pastures
wide
and
many
a
wild
romantic
nook
for
this
the
nymphs
at
fall
of
eave
oft
dance
upon
the
flowâ€™ry
banks
and
sing
my
name
and
garlands
weave
to
bear
beneath
the
wave
their
thanks
in
coral
bowâ€™rs
i
love
to
lie
and
hear
the
surges
roll
above
and
through
the
waters
view
on
high
the
proud
ships
sail
and
gay
clouds
move
and
oft
at
midnightâ€™s
stillest
hour
when
summer
seas
the
vessel
lave
i
love
to
prove
my
charmful
powâ€™r
while
floating
on
the
moonlight
wave
and
when
deep
sleep
the
crew
has
bound
and
the
sad
lover
musing
leans
oâ€™er
the
shipâ€™s
side
i
breathe
around
such
strains
as
speak
no
mortal
means
oâ€™er
the
dim
waves
his
searching
eye
sees
but
the
vesselâ€™s
lengthenâ€™d
shade
aboveâ€”the
moon
and
azure
sky
entrancâ€™d
he
hears
and
half
afraid
sometimes
a
single
note
i
swell
that
softly
sweet
at
distance
dies
then
wake
the
magic
of
my
shell
and
choral
voices
round
me
rise
the
trembling
youth
charmâ€™d
by
my
strain
calls
up
the
crew
who
silent
bend
oâ€™er
the
high
deck
but
list
in
vain
my
song
is
hushâ€™d
my
wonders
end
within
the
mountainâ€™s
woody
bay
where
the
tall
bark
at
anchor
rides
at
twilight
hour
with
tritons
gay
i
dance
upon
the
lapsing
tides
and
with
my
sister-nymphs
i
sport
till
the
broad
sun
looks
oâ€™er
the
floods
then
swift
we
seek
our
crystal
court
deep
in
the
wave
â€™mid
neptuneâ€™s
woods
in
cool
arcades
and
glassy
halls
we
pass
the
sultry
hours
of
noon
beyond
wherever
sunbeam
falls
weaving
sea-flowers
in
gay
festoon
the
while
we
chant
our
ditties
sweet
to
some
soft
shell
that
warbles
near
joinâ€™d
by
the
murmuring
currents
fleet
that
glide
along
our
halls
so
clear
there
the
pale
pearl
and
sapphire
blue
and
ruby
red
and
emâ€™rald
green
dart
from
the
domes
a
changing
hue
and
sparry
columns
deck
the
scene
when
the
dark
storm
scowls
oâ€™er
the
deep
and
long
long
peals
of
thunder
sound
on
some
high
cliff
my
watch
i
keep
oâ€™er
all
the
restless
seas
around
till
on
the
ridgy
wave
afar
comes
the
lone
vessel
labouring
slow
spreading
the
white
foam
in
the
air
with
sail
and
top-mast
bending
low
then
plunge
i
â€™mid
the
oceanâ€™s
roar
my
way
by
quivâ€™ring
lightnings
shown
to
guide
the
bark
to
peaceful
shore
and
hush
the
sailorâ€™s
fearful
groan
and
if
too
late
i
reach
its
side
to
save
it
from
the
â€™whelming
surge
i
call
my
dolphins
oâ€™er
the
tide
to
bear
the
crew
where
isles
emerge
their
mournful
spirits
soon
i
cheer
while
round
the
desert
coast
i
go
with
warbled
songs
they
faintly
hear
oft
as
the
stormy
gust
sinks
low
my
music
leads
to
lofty
groves
that
wild
upon
the
sea-bank
wave
where
sweet
fruits
bloom
and
fresh
spring
roves
and
closing
boughs
the
tempest
brave
then
from
the
air
spirits
obey
my
potent
voice
they
love
so
well
and
on
the
clouds
paint
visions
gay
while
strains
more
sweet
at
distance
swell
and
thus
the
lonely
hours
i
cheat
soothing
the
ship-wreckâ€™d
sailorâ€™s
heart
till
from
the
waves
the
storms
retreat
and
oâ€™er
the
east
the
day-beams
dart
neptune
for
this
oft
binds
me
fast
to
rocks
below
with
coral
chain
till
all
the
tempestâ€™s
over-past
and
drowning
seamen
cry
in
vain
whoeâ€™er
ye
are
that
love
my
lay
come
when
red
sunset
tints
the
wave
to
the
still
sands
where
fairies
play
there
in
cool
seas
i
love
to
lave
he
is
a
great
observer
and
he
looks
quite
through
the
deeds
of
men
he
loves
no
plays
he
hears
no
music
seldom
he
smiles
and
smiles
in
such
a
sort
as
if
he
mockâ€™d
himself
and
scornâ€™d
his
spirit
that
could
be
movâ€™d
to
smile
at

such
men

he
be
never
at
heartâ€™s
ease
while
they
behold
a
greater
than
themselves
julius
cã†sar
montoni
and
his
companion
did
not
return
home
till
many
hours
after
the
dawn
had
blushed
upon
the
adriatic
the
airy
groups
which
had
danced
all
night
along
the
colonnade
of
st
mark
dispersed
before
the
morning
like
so
many
spirits
montoni
had
been
otherwise
engaged
his
soul
was
little
susceptible
of
light
pleasures
he
delighted
in
the
energies
of
the
passions
the
difficulties
and
tempests
of
life
which
wreck
the
happiness
of
others
roused
and
strengthened
all
the
powers
of
his
mind
and
afforded
him
the
highest
enjoyments
of
which
his
nature
was
capable
without
some
object
of
strong
interest
life
was
to
him
little
more
than
a
sleep
and
when
pursuits
of
real
interest
failed
he
substituted
artificial
ones
till
habit
changed
their
nature
and
they
ceased
to
be
unreal
of
this
kind
was
the
habit
of
gaming
which
he
had
adopted
first
for
the
purpose
of
relieving
him
from
the
languor
of
inaction
but
had
since
pursued
with
the
ardour
of
passion
in
this
occupation
he
had
passed
the
night
with
cavigni
and
a
party
of
young
men
who
had
more
money
than
rank
and
more
vice
than
either
montoni
despised
the
greater
part
of
these
for
the
inferiority
of
their
talents
rather
than
for
their
vicious
inclinations
and
associated
with
them
only
to
make
them
the
instruments
of
his
purposes
among
these
however
were
some
of
superior
abilities
and
a
few
whom
montoni
admitted
to
his
intimacy
but
even
towards
these
he
still
preserved
a
decisive
and
haughty
air
which
while
it
imposed
submission
on
weak
and
timid
minds
roused
the
fierce
hatred
of
strong
ones
he
had
of
course
many
and
bitter
enemies
but
the
rancour
of
their
hatred
proved
the
degree
of
his
power
and
as
power
was
his
chief
aim
he
gloried
more
in
such
hatred
than
it
was
possible
he
could
in
being
esteemed
a
feeling
so
tempered
as
that
of
esteem
he
despised
and
would
have
despised
himself
also
had
he
thought
himself
capable
of
being
flattered
by
it
among
the
few
whom
he
distinguished
were
the
signors
bertolini
orsino
and
verezzi
the
first
was
a
man
of
gay
temper
strong
passions
dissipated
and
of
unbounded
extravagance
but
generous
brave
and
unsuspicious
orsino
was
reserved
and
haughty
loving
power
more
than
ostentation
of
a
cruel
and
suspicious
temper
quick
to
feel
an
injury
and
relentless
in
avenging
it
cunning
and
unsearchable
in
contrivance
patient
and
indefatigable
in
the
execution
of
his
schemes
he
had
a
perfect
command
of
feature
and
of
his
passions
of
which
he
had
scarcely
any
but
pride
revenge
and
avarice
and
in
the
gratification
of
these
few
considerations
had
power
to
restrain
him
few
obstacles
to
withstand
the
depth
of
his
stratagems
this
man
was
the
chief
favourite
of
montoni
verezzi
was
a
man
of
some
talent
of
fiery
imagination
and
the
slave
of
alternate
passions
he
was
gay
voluptuous
and
daring
yet
had
neither
perseverance
nor
true
courage
and
was
meanly
selfish
in
all
his
aims
quick
to
form
schemes
and
sanguine
in
his
hope
of
success
he
was
the
first
to
undertake
and
to
abandon
not
only
his
own
plans
but
those
adopted
from
other
persons
proud
and
impetuous
he
revolted
against
all
subordination
yet
those
who
were
acquainted
with
his
character
and
watched
the
turn
of
his
passions
could
lead
him
like
a
child
such
were
the
friends
whom
montoni
introduced
to
his
family
and
his
table
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
at
venice
there
were
also
of
the
party
a
venetian
nobleman
count
morano
and
a
signora
livona
whom
montoni
had
introduced
to
his
wife
as
a
lady
of
distinguished
merit
and
who
having
called
in
the
morning
to
welcome
her
to
venice
had
been
requested
to
be
of
the
dinner
party
madame
montoni
received
with
a
very
ill
grace
the
compliments
of
the
signors
she
disliked
them
because
they
were
the
friends
of
her
husband
hated
them
because
she
believed
they
had
contributed
to
detain
him
abroad
till
so
late
an
hour
of
the
preceding
morning
and
envied
them
since
conscious
of
her
own
want
of
influence
she
was
convinced
that
he
preferred
their
society
to
her
own
the
rank
of
count
morano
procured
him
that
distinction
which
she
refused
to
the
rest
of
the
company
the
haughty
sullenness
of
her
countenance
and
manner
and
the
ostentatious
extravagance
of
her
dress
for
she
had
not
yet
adopted
the
venetian
habit
were
strikingly
contrasted
by
the
beauty
modesty
sweetness
and
simplicity
of
emily
who
observed
with
more
attention
than
pleasure
the
party
around
her
the
beauty
and
fascinating
manners
of
signora
livona
however
won
her
involuntary
regard
while
the
sweetness
of
her
accents
and
her
air
of
gentle
kindness
awakened
with
emily
those
pleasing
affections
which
so
long
had
slumbered
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
the
party
embarked
in
montoniâ€™s
gondola
and
rowed
out
upon
the
sea
the
red
glow
of
sunset
still
touched
the
waves
and
lingered
in
the
west
where
the
melancholy
gleam
seemed
slowly
expiring
while
the
dark
blue
of
the
upper
ã¦ther
began
to
twinkle
with
stars
emily
sat
given
up
to
pensive
and
sweet
emotions
the
smoothness
of
the
water
over
which
she
glided
its
reflected
imagesâ€”a
new
heaven
and
trembling
stars
below
the
waves
with
shadowy
outlines
of
towers
and
porticos
conspired
with
the
stillness
of
the
hour
interrupted
only
by
the
passing
wave
or
the
notes
of
distant
music
to
raise
those
emotions
to
enthusiasm
as
she
listened
to
the
measured
sound
of
the
oars
and
to
the
remote
warblings
that
came
in
the
breeze
her
softened
mind
returned
to
the
memory
of
st
aubert
and
to
valancourt
and
tears
stole
to
her
eyes
the
rays
of
the
moon
strengthening
as
the
shadows
deepened
soon
after
threw
a
silvery
gleam
upon
her
countenance
which
was
partly
shaded
by
a
thin
black
veil
and
touched
it
with
inimitable
softness
hers
was
the
contour
of
a
madona
with
the
sensibility
of
a
magdalen
and
the
pensive
uplifted
eye
with
the
tear
that
glittered
on
her
cheek
confirmed
the
expression
of
the
character
the
last
strain
of
distant
music
now
died
in
air
for
the
gondola
was
far
upon
the
waves
and
the
party
determined
to
have
music
of
their
own
the
count
morano
who
sat
next
to
emily
and
who
had
been
observing
her
for
some
time
in
silence
snatched
up
a
lute
and
struck
the
chords
with
the
finger
of
harmony
herself
while
his
voice
a
fine
tenor
accompanied
them
in
a
rondeau
full
of
tender
sadness
to
him
indeed
might
have
been
applied
that
beautiful
exhortation
of
an
english
poet
had
it
then
existed
strike
up
my
master
but
touch
the
strings
with
a
religious
softness
teach
sounds
to
languish
through
the
nightâ€™s
dull
ear
till
melancholy
starts
from
off
her
couch
and
carelessness
grows
concert
to
attention
with
such
powers
of
expression
the
count
sung
the
following
rondeau
soft
as
yon
silver
ray
that
sleeps
upon
the
oceanâ€™s
trembling
tide
soft
as
the
air
that
lightly
sweeps
yon
sad
that
swells
in
stately
pride
soft
as
the
surgeâ€™s
stealing
note
that
dies
along
the
distant
shores
or
warbled
strain
that
sinks
remoteâ€”
so
soft
the
sigh
my
bosom
pours
true
as
the
wave
to
cynthiaâ€™s
ray
true
as
the
vessel
to
the
breeze
true
as
the
soul
to
musicâ€™s
sway
or
music
to
venetian
seas
soft
as
yon
silver
beams
that
sleep
upon
the
oceanâ€™s
trembling
breast
so
soft
so
true
fond
love
shall
weep
so
soft
so
true
with
thee
shall
rest
the
cadence
with
which
he
returned
from
the
last
stanza
to
a
repetition
of
the
first
the
fine
modulation
in
which
his
voice
stole
upon
the
first
line
and
the
pathetic
energy
with
which
it
pronounced
the
last
were
such
as
only
exquisite
taste
could
give
when
he
had
concluded
he
gave
the
lute
with
a
sigh
to
emily
who
to
avoid
any
appearance
of
affectation
immediately
began
to
play
she
sung
a
melancholy
little
air
one
of
the
popular
songs
of
her
native
province
with
a
simplicity
and
pathos
that
made
it
enchanting
but
its
well-known
melody
brought
so
forcibly
to
her
fancy
the
scenes
and
the
persons
among
which
she
had
often
heard
it
that
her
spirits
were
overcome
her
voice
trembled
and
ceasedâ€”and
the
strings
of
the
lute
were
struck
with
a
disordered
hand
till
ashamed
of
the
emotion
she
had
betrayed
she
suddenly
passed
on
to
a
song
so
gay
and
airy
that
the
steps
of
the
dance
seemed
almost
to
echo
to
the
notes
bravissimo
burst
instantly
from
the
lips
of
her
delighted
auditors
and
she
was
compelled
to
repeat
the
air
among
the
compliments
that
followed
those
of
the
count
were
not
the
least
audible
and
they
had
not
concluded
when
emily
gave
the
instrument
to
signora
livona
whose
voice
accompanied
it
with
true
italian
taste
afterwards
the
count
emily
cavigni
and
the
signora
sung
canzonettes
accompanied
by
a
couple
of
lutes
and
a
few
other
instruments
sometimes
the
instruments
suddenly
ceased
and
the
voices
dropped
from
the
full
swell
of
harmony
into
a
low
chant
then
after
a
deep
pause
they
rose
by
degrees
the
instruments
one
by
one
striking
up
till
the
loud
and
full
chorus
soared
again
to
heaven
meanwhile
montoni
who
was
weary
of
this
harmony
was
considering
how
he
might
disengage
himself
from
his
party
or
withdraw
with
such
of
it
as
would
be
willing
to
play
to
a
casino
in
a
pause
of
the
music
he
proposed
returning
to
shore
a
proposal
which
orsino
eagerly
seconded
but
which
the
count
and
the
other
gentlemen
as
warmly
opposed
montoni
still
meditated
how
he
might
excuse
himself
from
longer
attendance
upon
the
count
for
to
him
only
he
thought
excuse
necessary
and
how
he
might
get
to
land
till
the
gondolieri
of
an
empty
boat
returning
to
venice
hailed
his
people
without
troubling
himself
longer
about
an
excuse
he
seized
this
opportunity
of
going
thither
and
committing
the
ladies
to
the
care
of
his
friends
departed
with
orsino
while
emily
for
the
first
time
saw
him
go
with
regret
for
she
considered
his
presence
a
protection
though
she
knew
not
what
she
should
fear
he
landed
at
st
markâ€™s
and
hurrying
to
a
casino
was
soon
lost
amidst
a
crowd
of
gamesters
meanwhile
the
count
having
secretly
dispatched
a
servant
in
montoniâ€™s
boat
for
his
own
gondola
and
musicians
emily
heard
without
knowing
his
project
the
gay
song
of
gondolieri
approaching
as
they
sat
on
the
stern
of
the
boat
and
saw
the
tremulous
gleam
of
the
moonlight
wave
which
their
oars
disturbed
presently
she
heard
the
sound
of
instruments
and
then
a
full
symphony
swelled
on
the
air
and
the
boats
meeting
the
gondolieri
hailed
each
other
the
count
then
explaining
himself
the
party
removed
into
his
gondola
which
was
embellished
with
all
that
taste
could
bestow
while
they
partook
of
a
collation
of
fruits
and
ice
the
whole
band
following
at
a
distance
in
the
other
boat
played
the
most
sweet
and
enchanting
strains
and
the
count
who
had
again
seated
himself
by
emily
paid
her
unremitted
attention
and
sometimes
in
a
low
but
impassioned
voice
uttered
compliments
which
she
could
not
misunderstand
to
avoid
them
she
conversed
with
signora
livona
and
her
manner
to
the
count
assumed
a
mild
reserve
which
though
dignified
was
too
gentle
to
repress
his
assiduities
he
could
see
hear
speak
to
no
person
but
emily
while
cavigni
observed
him
now
and
then
with
a
look
of
displeasure
and
emily
with
one
of
uneasiness
she
now
wished
for
nothing
so
much
as
to
return
to
venice
but
it
was
near
midnight
before
the
gondolas
approached
st
markâ€™s
place
where
the
voice
of
gaiety
and
song
was
loud
the
busy
hum
of
mingling
sounds
was
heard
at
a
considerable
distance
on
the
water
and
had
not
a
bright
moonlight
discovered
the
city
with
its
terraces
and
towers
a
stranger
would
almost
have
credited
the
fabled
wonders
of
neptuneâ€™s
court
and
believed
that
the
tumult
arose
from
beneath
the
waves
they
landed
at
st
markâ€™s
where
the
gaiety
of
the
colonnades
and
the
beauty
of
the
night
made
madame
montoni
willingly
submit
to
the
countâ€™s
solicitations
to
join
the
promenade
and
afterwards
to
take
a
supper
with
the
rest
of
the
party
at
his
casino
if
anything
could
have
dissipated
emilyâ€™s
uneasiness
it
would
have
been
the
grandeur
gaiety
and
novelty
of
the
surrounding
scene
adorned
with
palladioâ€™s
palaces
and
busy
with
parties
of
masqueraders
at
length
they
withdrew
to
the
casino
which
was
fitted
up
with
infinite
taste
and
where
a
splendid
banquet
was
prepared
but
here
emilyâ€™s
reserve
made
the
count
perceive
that
it
was
necessary
for
his
interest
to
win
the
favour
of
madame
montoni
which
from
the
condescension
she
had
already
shown
to
him
appeared
to
be
an
achievement
of
no
great
difficulty
he
transferred
therefore
part
of
his
attention
from
emily
to
her
aunt
who
felt
too
much
flattered
by
the
distinction
even
to
disguise
her
emotion
and
before
the
party
broke
up
he
had
entirely
engaged
the
esteem
of
madame
montoni
whenever
he
addressed
her
her
ungracious
countenance
relaxed
into
smiles
and
to
whatever
he
proposed
she
assented
he
invited
her
with
the
rest
of
the
party
to
take
coffee
in
his
box
at
the
opera
on
the
following
evening
and
emily
heard
the
invitation
accepted
with
strong
anxiety
concerning
the
means
of
excusing
herself
from
attending
madame
montoni
thither
it
was
very
late
before
their
gondola
was
ordered
and
emilyâ€™s
surprise
was
extreme
when
on
quitting
the
casino
she
beheld
the
broad
sun
rising
out
of
the
adriatic
while
st
markâ€™s
place
was
yet
crowded
with
company
sleep
had
long
weighed
heavily
on
her
eyes
but
now
the
fresh
sea-breeze
revived
her
and
she
would
have
quitted
the
scene
with
regret
had
not
the
count
been
present
performing
the
duty
which
he
had
imposed
upon
himself
of
escorting
them
home
there
they
heard
that
montoni
was
not
yet
returned
and
his
wife
retiring
in
displeasure
to
her
apartment
at
length
released
emily
from
the
fatigue
of
further
attendance
montoni
came
home
late
in
the
morning
in
a
very
ill
humour
having
lost
considerably
at
play
and
before
he
withdrew
to
rest
had
a
private
conference
with
cavigni
whose
manner
on
the
following
day
seemed
to
tell
that
the
subject
of
it
had
not
been
pleasing
to
him
in
the
evening
madame
montoni
who
during
the
day
had
observed
a
sullen
silence
towards
her
husband
received
visits
from
some
venetian
ladies
with
whose
sweet
manners
emily
was
particularly
charmed
they
had
an
air
of
ease
and
kindness
towards
the
strangers
as
if
they
had
been
their
familiar
friends
for
years
and
their
conversation
was
by
turns
tender
sentimental
and
gay
madame
though
she
had
no
taste
for
such
conversation
and
whose
coarseness
and
selfishness
sometimes
exhibited
a
ludicrous
contrast
to
their
excessive
refinement
could
not
remain
wholly
insensible
to
the
captivations
of
their
manner
in
a
pause
of
conversation
a
lady
who
was
called
signora
herminia
took
up
a
lute
and
began
to
play
and
sing
with
as
much
easy
gaiety
as
if
she
had
been
alone
her
voice
was
uncommonly
rich
in
tone
and
various
in
expression
yet
she
appeared
to
be
entirely
unconscious
of
its
powers
and
meant
nothing
less
than
to
display
them
she
sung
from
the
gaiety
of
her
heart
as
she
sat
with
her
veil
half
thrown
back
holding
gracefully
the
lute
under
the
spreading
foliage
and
flowers
of
some
plants
that
rose
from
baskets
and
interlaced
one
of
the
lattices
of
the
saloon
emily
retiring
a
little
from
the
company
sketched
her
figure
with
the
miniature
scenery
around
her
and
drew
a
very
interesting
picture
which
though
it
would
not
perhaps
have
borne
criticism
had
spirit
and
taste
enough
to
awaken
both
the
fancy
and
the
heart
when
she
had
finished
it
she
presented
it
to
the
beautiful
original
who
was
delighted
with
the
offering
as
well
as
the
sentiment
it
conveyed
and
assured
emily
with
a
smile
of
captivating
sweetness
that
she
should
preserve
it
as
a
pledge
of
her
friendship
in
the
evening
cavigni
joined
the
ladies
but
montoni
had
other
engagements
and
they
embarked
in
the
gondola
for
st
markâ€™s
where
the
same
gay
company
seemed
to
flutter
as
on
the
preceding
night
the
cool
breeze
the
glassy
sea
the
gentle
sound
of
its
waves
and
the
sweeter
murmur
of
distant
music
the
lofty
porticos
and
arcades
and
the
happy
groups
that
sauntered
beneath
them
these
with
every
feature
and
circumstance
of
the
scene
united
to
charm
emily
no
longer
teased
by
the
officious
attentions
of
count
morano
but
as
she
looked
upon
the
moonlight
sea
undulating
along
the
walls
of
st
mark
and
lingering
for
a
moment
over
those
walls
caught
the
sweet
and
melancholy
song
of
some
gondolier
as
he
sat
in
his
boat
below
waiting
for
his
master
her
softened
mind
returned
to
the
memory
of
her
home
of
her
friends
and
of
all
that
was
dear
in
her
native
country
after
walking
some
time
they
sat
down
at
the
door
of
a
casino
and
while
cavigni
was
accommodating
them
with
coffee
and
ice
were
joined
by
count
morano
he
sought
emily
with
a
look
of
impatient
delight
who
remembering
all
the
attention
he
had
shown
her
on
the
preceding
evening
was
compelled
as
before
to
shrink
from
his
assiduities
into
a
timid
reserve
except
when
she
conversed
with
signora
herminia
and
the
other
ladies
of
her
party
it
was
near
midnight
before
they
withdrew
to
the
opera
where
emily
was
not
so
charmed
but
that
when
she
remembered
the
scene
she
had
just
quitted
she
felt
how
infinitely
inferior
all
the
splendour
of
art
is
to
the
sublimity
of
nature
her
heart
was
not
now
affected
tears
of
admiration
did
not
start
to
her
eyes
as
when
she
viewed
the
vast
expanse
of
ocean
the
grandeur
of
the
heavens
and
listened
to
the
rolling
waters
and
to
the
faint
music
that
at
intervals
mingled
with
their
roar
remembering
these
the
scene
before
her
faded
into
insignificance
of
the
evening
which
passed
on
without
any
particular
incident
she
wished
the
conclusion
that
she
might
escape
from
the
attentions
of
the
count
and
as
opposite
qualities
frequently
attract
each
other
in
our
thoughts
thus
emily
when
she
looked
on
count
morano
remembered
valancourt
and
a
sigh
sometimes
followed
the
recollection
several
weeks
passed
in
the
course
of
customary
visits
during
which
nothing
remarkable
occurred
emily
was
amused
by
the
manners
and
scenes
that
surrounded
her
so
different
from
those
of
france
but
where
count
morano
too
frequently
for
her
comfort
contrived
to
introduce
himself
his
manner
figure
and
accomplishments
which
were
generally
admired
emily
would
perhaps
have
admired
also
had
her
heart
been
disengaged
from
valancourt
and
had
the
count
forborne
to
persecute
her
with
officious
attentions
during
which
she
observed
some
traits
in
his
character
that
prejudiced
her
against
whatever
might
otherwise
be
good
in
it
soon
after
his
arrival
at
venice
montoni
received
a
packet
from
m
quesnel
in
which
the
latter
mentioned
the
death
of
his
wifeâ€™s
uncle
at
his
villa
on
the
brenta
and
that
in
consequence
of
this
event
he
should
hasten
to
take
possession
of
that
estate
and
of
other
effects
bequeathed
to
him
this
uncle
was
the
brother
of
madame
quesnelâ€™s
late
mother
montoni
was
related
to
her
by
the
fatherâ€™s
side
and
though
he
could
have
had
neither
claim
nor
expectation
concerning
these
possessions
he
could
scarcely
conceal
the
envy
which
m
quesnelâ€™s
letter
excited
emily
had
observed
with
concern
that
since
they
left
france
montoni
had
not
even
affected
kindness
towards
her
aunt
and
that
after
treating
her
at
first
with
neglect
he
now
met
her
with
uniform
ill-humour
and
reserve
she
had
never
supposed
that
her
auntâ€™s
foibles
could
have
escaped
the
discernment
of
montoni
or
that
her
mind
or
figure
were
of
a
kind
to
deserve
his
attention
her
surprise
therefore
at
this
match
had
been
extreme
but
since
he
had
made
the
choice
she
did
not
suspect
that
he
would
so
openly
have
discovered
his
contempt
of
it
but
montoni
who
had
been
allured
by
the
seeming
wealth
of
madame
cheron
was
now
severely
disappointed
by
her
comparative
poverty
and
highly
exasperated
by
the
deceit
she
had
employed
to
conceal
it
till
concealment
was
no
longer
necessary
he
had
been
deceived
in
an
affair
wherein
he
meant
to
be
the
deceiver
out-witted
by
the
superior
cunning
of
a
woman
whose
understanding
he
despised
and
to
whom
he
had
sacrificed
his
pride
and
his
liberty
without
saving
himself
from
the
ruin
which
had
impended
over
his
head
madame
montoni
had
contrived
to
have
the
greatest
part
of
what
she
really
did
possess
settled
upon
herself
what
remained
though
it
was
totally
inadequate
both
to
her
husbandâ€™s
expectations
and
to
his
necessities
he
had
converted
into
money
and
brought
with
him
to
venice
that
he
might
a
little
longer
delude
society
and
make
a
last
effort
to
regain
the
fortunes
he
had
lost
the
hints
which
had
been
thrown
out
to
valancourt
concerning
montoniâ€™s
character
and
condition
were
too
true
but
it
was
now
left
to
time
and
occasion
to
unfold
the
circumstances
both
of
what
had
and
of
what
had
not
been
hinted
and
to
time
and
occasion
we
commit
them
madame
montoni
was
not
of
a
nature
to
bear
injuries
with
meekness
or
to
resent
them
with
dignity
her
exasperated
pride
displayed
itself
in
all
the
violence
and
acrimony
of
a
little
or
at
least
of
an
ill-regulated
mind
she
would
not
acknowledge
even
to
herself
that
she
had
in
any
degree
provoked
contempt
by
her
duplicity
but
weakly
persisted
in
believing
that
she
alone
was
to
be
pitied
and
montoni
alone
to
be
censured
for
as
her
mind
had
naturally
little
perception
of
moral
obligation
she
seldom
understood
its
force
but
when
it
happened
to
be
violated
towards
herself
her
vanity
had
already
been
severely
shocked
by
a
discovery
of
montoniâ€™s
contempt
it
remained
to
be
farther
reproved
by
a
discovery
of
his
circumstances
his
mansion
at
venice
though
its
furniture
discovered
a
part
of
the
truth
to
unprejudiced
persons
told
nothing
to
those
who
were
blinded
by
a
resolution
to
believe
whatever
they
wished
madame
montoni
still
thought
herself
little
less
than
a
princess
possessing
a
palace
at
venice
and
a
castle
among
the
apennines
to
the
castle
di
udolpho
indeed
montoni
sometimes
talked
of
going
for
a
few
weeks
to
examine
into
its
condition
and
to
receive
some
rents
for
it
appeared
that
he
had
not
been
there
for
two
years
and
that
during
this
period
it
had
been
inhabited
only
by
an
old
servant
whom
he
called
his
steward
emily
listened
to
the
mention
of
this
journey
with
pleasure
for
she
not
only
expected
from
it
new
ideas
but
a
release
from
the
persevering
assiduities
of
count
morano
in
the
country
too
she
would
have
leisure
to
think
of
valancourt
and
to
indulge
the
melancholy
which
his
image
and
a
recollection
of
the
scenes
of
la
vallã©e
always
blessed
with
the
memory
of
her
parents
awakened
the
ideal
scenes
were
dearer
and
more
soothing
to
her
heart
than
all
the
splendour
of
gay
assemblies
they
were
a
kind
of
talisman
that
expelled
the
poison
of
temporary
evils
and
supported
her
hopes
of
happy
days
they
appeared
like
a
beautiful
landscape
lighted
up
by
a
gleam
of
sunshine
and
seen
through
a
perspective
of
dark
and
rugged
rocks
but
count
morano
did
not
long
confine
himself
to
silent
assiduities
he
declared
his
passion
to
emily
and
made
proposals
to
montoni
who
encouraged
though
emily
rejected
him
with
montoni
for
his
friend
and
an
abundance
of
vanity
to
delude
him
he
did
not
despair
of
success
emily
was
astonished
and
highly
disgusted
at
his
perseverance
after
she
had
explained
her
sentiments
with
a
frankness
that
would
not
allow
him
to
misunderstand
them
he
now
passed
the
greater
part
of
his
time
at
montoniâ€™s
dining
there
almost
daily
and
attending
madame
and
emily
wherever
they
went
and
all
this
notwithstanding
the
uniform
reserve
of
emily
whose
aunt
seemed
as
anxious
as
montoni
to
promote
this
marriage
and
would
never
dispense
with
her
attendance
at
any
assembly
where
the
count
proposed
to
be
present
montoni
now
said
nothing
of
his
intended
journey
of
which
emily
waited
impatiently
to
hear
and
he
was
seldom
at
home
but
when
the
count
or
signor
orsino
was
there
for
between
himself
and
cavigni
a
coolness
seemed
to
subsist
though
the
latter
remained
in
his
house
with
orsino
montoni
was
frequently
closeted
for
hours
together
and
whatever
might
be
the
business
upon
which
they
consulted
it
appeared
to
be
of
consequence
since
montoni
often
sacrificed
to
it
his
favourite
passion
for
play
and
remained
at
home
the
whole
night
there
was
somewhat
of
privacy
too
in
the
manner
of
orsinoâ€™s
visits
which
had
never
before
occurred
and
which
excited
not
only
surprise
but
some
degree
of
alarm
in
emilyâ€™s
mind
who
had
unwillingly
discovered
much
of
his
character
when
he
had
most
endeavoured
to
disguise
it
after
these
visits
montoni
was
often
more
thoughtful
than
usual
sometimes
the
deep
workings
of
his
mind
entirely
abstracted
him
from
surrounding
objects
and
threw
a
gloom
over
his
visage
that
rendered
it
terrible
at
others
his
eyes
seemed
almost
to
flash
fire
and
all
the
energies
of
his
soul
appeared
to
be
roused
for
some
great
enterprise
emily
observed
these
written
characters
of
his
thoughts
with
deep
interest
and
not
without
some
degree
of
awe
when
she
considered
that
she
was
entirely
in
his
power
but
forbore
even
to
hint
her
fears
or
her
observations
to
madame
montoni
who
discerned
nothing
in
her
husband
at
these
times
but
his
usual
sternness
a
second
letter
from
m
quesnel
announced
the
arrival
of
himself
and
his
lady
at
the
villa
miarenti
stated
several
circumstances
of
his
good
fortune
respecting
the
affair
that
had
brought
him
into
italy
and
concluded
with
an
earnest
request
to
see
montoni
his
wife
and
niece
at
his
new
estate
emily
received
about
the
same
period
a
much
more
interesting
letter
and
which
soothed
for
a
while
every
anxiety
of
her
heart
valancourt
hoping
she
might
be
still
at
venice
had
trusted
a
letter
to
the
ordinary
post
that
told
her
of
his
health
and
of
his
unceasing
and
anxious
affection
he
had
lingered
at
thoulouse
for
some
time
after
her
departure
that
he
might
indulge
the
melancholy
pleasure
of
wandering
through
the
scenes
where
he
had
been
accustomed
to
behold
her
and
had
thence
gone
to
his
brotherâ€™s
chã¢teau
which
was
in
the
neighbourhood
of
la
vallã©e
having
mentioned
this
he
added
â€œif
the
duty
of
attending
my
regiment
did
not
require
my
departure
i
know
not
when
i
should
have
resolution
enough
to
quit
the
neighbourhood
of
a
place
which
is
endeared
by
the
remembrance
of
you
the
vicinity
to
la
vallã©e
has
alone
detained
me
thus
long
at
estuviã¨re
i
frequently
ride
thither
early
in
the
morning
that
i
may
wander
at
leisure
through
the
day
among
scenes
which
were
once
your
home
where
i
have
been
accustomed
to
see
you
and
to
hear
you
converse
i
have
renewed
my
acquaintance
with
the
good
old
theresa
who
rejoiced
to
see
me
that
she
might
talk
of
you
i
need
not
say
how
much
this
circumstance
attached
me
to
her
or
how
eagerly
i
listened
to
her
upon
her
favourite
subject
you
will
guess
the
motive
that
first
induced
me
to
make
myself
known
to
theresa
it
was
indeed
no
other
than
that
of
gaining
admittance
into
the
chã¢teau
and
gardens
which
my
emily
had
so
lately
inhabited
here
then
i
wander
and
meet
your
image
under
every
shade
but
chiefly
i
love
to
sit
beneath
the
spreading
branches
of
your
favourite
plane
where
once
emily
we
sat
together
where
i
first
ventured
to
tell
you
that
i
loved
o
emily
the
remembrance
of
those
moments
overcomes
meâ€”i
sit
lost
in
reverieâ€”i
endeavour
to
see
you
dimly
through
my
tears
in
all
the
heaven
of
peace
and
innocence
such
as
you
then
appeared
to
me
to
hear
again
the
accents
of
that
voice
which
then
thrilled
my
heart
with
tenderness
and
hope
i
lean
on
the
wall
of
the
terrace
where
we
together
watched
the
rapid
current
of
the
garonne
below
while
i
described
the
wild
scenery
about
its
source
but
thought
only
of
you
o
emily
are
these
moments
passed
for
everâ€”will
they
never
more
returnâ€
in
another
part
of
his
letter
he
wrote
thus
â€œyou
see
my
letter
is
dated
on
many
different
days
and
if
you
look
back
to
the
first
you
will
perceive
that
i
began
to
write
soon
after
your
departure
from
france
to
write
was
indeed
the
only
employment
that
withdrew
me
from
my
own
melancholy
and
rendered
your
absence
supportable
or
rather
it
seemed
to
destroy
absence
for
when
i
was
conversing
with
you
on
paper
and
telling
you
every
sentiment
and
affection
of
my
heart
you
almost
appeared
to
be
present
this
employment
has
been
from
time
to
time
my
chief
consolation
and
i
have
deferred
sending
off
my
packet
merely
for
the
comfort
of
prolonging
it
though
it
was
certain
that
what
i
had
written
was
written
to
no
purpose
till
you
received
it
whenever
my
mind
has
been
more
than
usually
depressed
i
have
come
to
pour
forth
its
sorrows
to
you
and
have
always
found
consolation
and
when
any
little
occurrence
has
interested
my
heart
and
given
a
gleam
of
joy
to
my
spirits
i
have
hastened
to
communicate
it
to
you
and
have
received
reflected
satisfaction
thus
my
letter
is
a
kind
of
picture
of
my
life
and
of
my
thoughts
for
the
last
month
and
thus
though
it
has
been
deeply
interesting
to
me
while
i
wrote
it
and
i
dare
hope
will
for
the
same
reason
be
not
indifferent
to
you
yet
to
other
readers
it
would
seem
to
abound
only
in
frivolities
thus
it
is
always
when
we
attempt
to
describe
the
finer
movements
of
the
heart
for
they
are
too
fine
to
be
discerned
they
can
only
be
experienced
and
are
therefore
passed
over
by
the
indifferent
observer
while
the
interested
one
feels
that
all
description
is
imperfect
and
unnecessary
except
as
it
may
prove
the
sincerity
of
the
writer
and
sooth
his
own
sufferings
you
will
pardon
all
this
egotismâ€”for
i
am
a
loverâ€
â€œi
have
just
heard
of
a
circumstance
which
entirely
destroys
all
my
fairy
paradise
of
ideal
delight
and
which
will
reconcile
me
to
the
necessity
of
returning
to
my
regiment
for
i
must
no
longer
wander
beneath
the
beloved
shades
where
i
have
been
accustomed
to
meet
you
in
thoughtâ€”la
vallã©e
is
let
i
have
reason
to
believe
this
is
without
your
knowledge
from
what
theresa
told
me
this
morning
and
therefore
i
mention
the
circumstance
she
shed
tears
while
she
related
that
she
was
going
to
leave
the
service
of
her
dear
mistress
and
the
chã¢teau
where
she
had
lived
so
many
happy
years
and
all
this
added
she
without
even
a
letter
from
mademoiselle
to
soften
the
news
but
it
is
all
mons
quesnelâ€™s
doings
and
i
dare
say
she
does
not
even
know
what
is
going
forwardâ€
â€œtheresa
added
that
she
had
received
a
letter
from
him
informing
her
the
chã¢teau
was
let
and
that
as
her
services
would
no
longer
be
required
she
must
quit
the
place
on
that
day
week
when
the
new
tenant
would
arriveâ€
â€œtheresa
had
been
surprised
by
a
visit
from
m
quesnel
some
time
before
the
receipt
of
this
letter
who
was
accompanied
by
a
stranger
that
viewed
the
premises
with
much
curiosityâ€
towards
the
conclusion
of
his
letter
which
is
dated
a
week
after
this
sentence
valancourt
adds
â€œi
have
received
a
summons
from
my
regiment
and
i
join
it
without
regret
since
i
am
shut
out
from
the
scenes
that
are
so
interesting
to
my
heart
i
rode
to
la
vallã©e
this
morning
and
heard
that
the
new
tenant
was
arrived
and
that
theresa
was
gone
i
should
not
treat
the
subject
thus
familiarly
if
i
did
not
believe
you
to
be
uninformed
of
this
disposal
of
your
house
for
your
satisfaction
i
have
endeavoured
to
learn
something
of
the
character
and
fortune
of
your
tenant
but
without
success
he
is
a
gentleman
they
say
and
this
is
all
i
can
hear
the
place
as
i
wandered
round
the
boundaries
appeared
more
melancholy
to
my
imagination
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
i
wished
earnestly
to
have
got
admittance
that
i
might
have
taken
another
leave
of
your
favourite
plane-tree
and
thought
of
you
once
more
beneath
its
shade
but
i
forbore
to
tempt
the
curiosity
of
strangers
the
fishing-house
in
the
woods
however
was
still
open
to
me
thither
i
went
and
passed
an
hour
which
i
cannot
even
look
back
upon
without
emotion
o
emily
surely
we
are
not
separated
for
everâ€”surely
we
shall
live
for
each
otherâ€
this
letter
brought

tears
to
emilyâ€™s
eyes
tears
of
tenderness
and
satisfaction
on
learning
that
valancourt
was
well
and
that
time
and
absence
had
in
no
degree
effaced
her
image
from
his
heart
there
were
passages
in
this
letter
which
particularly
affected
her
such
as
those
describing
his
visits
to
la
vallã©e
and
the
sentiments
of
delicate
affection
that
its
scenes
had
awakened
it
was
a
considerable
time
before
her
mind
was
sufficiently
abstracted
from
valancourt
to
feel
the
force
of
his
intelligence
concerning
la
vallã©e
that
mons
quesnel
should
let
it
without
even
consulting
her
on
the
measure
both
surprised
and
shocked
her
particularly
as
it
proved
the
absolute
authority
he
thought
himself
entitled
to
exercise
in
her
affairs
it
is
true
he
had
proposed
before
she
left
france
that
the
chã¢teau
should
be
let
during
her
absence
and
to
the
economical
prudence
of
this
she
had
nothing
to
object
but
the
committing
what
had
been
her
fatherâ€™s
villa
to
the
power
and
caprice
of
strangers
and
the
depriving
herself
of
a
sure
home
should
any
unhappy
circumstances
make
her
look
back
to
her
home
as
an
asylum
were
considerations
that
made
her
even
then
strongly
oppose
the
measure
her
father
too
in
his
last
hour
had
received
from
her
a
solemn
promise
never
to
dispose
of
la
vallã©e
and
this
she
considered
as
in
some
degree
violated
if
she
suffered
the
place
to
be
let
but
it
was
now
evident
with
how
little
respect
m
quesnel
had
regarded
these
objections
and
how
insignificant
he
considered
every
obstacle
to
pecuniary
advantage
it
appeared
also
that
he
had
not
even
condescended
to
inform
montoni
of
the
step
he
had
taken
since
no
motive
was
evident
for
montoniâ€™s
concealing
the
circumstance
from
her
if
it
had
been
made
known
to
him
this
both
displeased
and
surprised
her
but
the
chief
subjects
of
her
uneasiness
wereâ€”the
temporary
disposal
of
la
vallã©e
and
the
dismission
of
her
fatherâ€™s
old
and
faithful
servantâ€”â€œpoor
theresaâ€
said
emily
â€œthou
hadst
not
saved
much
in
thy
servitude
for
thou
wast
always
tender
towards
the
poor
and
believdâ€™st
thou
shouldst
die
in
the
family
where
thy
best
years
had
been
spent
poor
theresaâ€”now
thou
art
turned
out
in
thy
old
age
to
seek
thy
breadâ€
emily
wept
bitterly
as
these
thoughts
passed
over
her
mind
and
she
determined
to
consider
what
could
be
done
for
theresa
and
to
talk
very
explicitly
to
m
quesnel
on
the
subject
but
she
much
feared
that
his
cold
heart
could
feel
only
for
itself
she
determined
also
to
enquire
whether
he
had
made
any
mention
of
her
affairs
in
his
letter
to
montoni
who
soon
gave
her
the
opportunity
she
sought
by
desiring
that
she
would
attend
him
in
his
study
she
had
little
doubt
that
the
interview
was
intended
for
the
purpose
of
communicating
to
her
a
part
of
m
quesnelâ€™s
letter
concerning
the
transactions
at
la
vallã©e
and
she
obeyed
him
immediately
montoni
was
alone
â€œi
have
just
been
writing
to
mons
quesnelâ€
said
he
when
emily
appeared
â€œin
reply
to
the
letter
i
received
from
him
a
few
days
ago
and
i
wished
to
talk
to
you
upon
a
subject
that
occupied
part
of
itâ€
â€œi
also
wished
to
speak
with
you
on
this
topic
sirâ€
said
emily
â€œit
is
a
subject
of
some
interest
to
you
undoubtedlyâ€
rejoined
montoni
â€œand
i
think
you
must
see
it
in
the
light
that
i
do
indeed
it
will
not
bear
any
other
i
trust
you
will
agree
with
me
that
any
objection
founded
on
sentiment
as
they
call
it
ought
to
yield
to
circumstances
of
solid
advantageâ€
â€œgranting
this
sirâ€
replied
emily
modestly
â€œthose
of
humanity
ought
surely
to
be
attended
to
but
i
fear
it
is
now
too
late
to
deliberate
upon
this
plan
and
i
must
regret
that
it
is
no
longer
in
my
power
to
reject
itâ€
â€œit
is
too
lateâ€
said
montoni
â€œbut
since
it
is
so
i
am
pleased
to
observe
that
you
submit
to
reason
and
necessity
without
indulging
useless
complaint
i
applaud
this
conduct
exceedingly
the
more
perhaps
since
it
discovers
a
strength
of
mind
seldom
observable
in
your
sex
when
you
are
older
you
will
look
back
with
gratitude
to
the
friends
who
assisted
in
rescuing
you
from
the
romantic
illusions
of
sentiment
and
will
perceive
that
they
are
only
the
snares
of
childhood
and
should
be
vanquished
the
moment
you
escape
from
the
nursery
i
have
not
closed
my
letter
and
you
may
add
a
few
lines
to
inform
your
uncle
of
your
acquiescence
you
will
soon
see
him
for
it
is
my
intention
to
take
you
with
madame
montoni
in
a
few
days
to
miarenti
and
you
can
then
talk
over
the
affairâ€
emily
wrote
on
the
opposite
page
of
the
paper
as
follows
â€œit
is
now
useless
sir
for
me
to
remonstrate
upon
the
circumstances
of
which
signor
montoni
informs
me
that
he
has
written
i
could
have
wished
at
least
that
the
affair
had
been
concluded
with
less
precipitation
that
i
might
have
taught
myself
to
subdue
some
prejudices
as
the
signor
calls
them
which
still
linger
in
my
heart
as
it
is
i
submit
in
point
of
prudence
nothing
certainly
can
be
objected
but
though
i
submit
i
have
yet
much
to
say
on
some
other
points
of
the
subject
when
i
shall
have
the
honour
of
seeing
you
in
the
meantime
i
entreat
you
will
take
care
of
theresa
for
the
sake
of
â€œsir
â€œyour
affectionate
niece
â€œemily
st
aubertâ€
montoni
smiled
satirically
at
what
emily
had
written
but
did
not
object
to
it
and
she
withdrew
to
her
own
apartment
where
she
sat
down
to
begin
a
letter
to
valancourt
in
which
she
related
the
particulars
of
her
journey
and
her
arrival
at
venice
described
some
of
the
most
striking
scenes
in
the
passage
over
the
alps
her
emotions
on
her
first
view
of
italy
the
manners
and
characters
of
the
people
around
her
and
some
few
circumstances
of
montoniâ€™s
conduct
but
she
avoided
even
naming
count
morano
much
more
the
declaration
he
had
made
since
she
well
knew
how
tremblingly
alive
to
fear
is
real
love
how
jealously
watchful
of
every
circumstance
that
may
affect
its
interest
and
she
scrupulously
avoided
to
give
valancourt
even
the
slightest
reason
for
believing
he
had
a
rival
on
the
following
day
count
morano
dined
again
at
montoniâ€™s
he
was
in
an
uncommon
flow
of
spirits
and
emily
thought
there
was
somewhat
of
exultation
in
his
manner
of
addressing
her
which
she
had
never
observed
before
she
endeavoured
to
repress
this
by
more
than
her
usual
reserve
but
the
cold
civility
of
her
air
now
seemed
rather
to
encourage
than
to
depress
him
he
appeared
watchful
of
an
opportunity
of
speaking
with
her
alone
and
more
than
once
solicited
this
but
emily
always
replied
that
she
could
hear
nothing
from
him
which
he
would
be
unwilling
to
repeat
before
the
whole
company
in
the
evening
madame
montoni
and
her
party
went
out
upon
the
sea
and
as
the
count
led
emily
to
his
zendaletto
he
carried
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
thanked
her
for
the
condescension
she
had
shown
him
emily
in
extreme
surprise
and
displeasure
hastily
withdrew
her
hand
and
concluded
that
he
had
spoken
ironically
but
on
reaching
the
steps
of
the
terrace
and
observing
by
the
livery
that
it
was
the
countâ€™s
zendaletto
which
waited
below
while
the
rest
of
the
party
having
arranged
themselves
in
the
gondolas
were
moving
on
she
determined
not
to
permit
a
separate
conversation
and
wishing
him
a
good
evening
returned
to
the
portico
the
count
followed
to
expostulate
and
entreat
and
montoni
who
then
came
out
rendered
solicitation
unnecessary
for
without
condescending
to
speak
he
took
her
hand
and
led
her
to
the
zendaletto
emily
was
not
silent
she
entreated
montoni
in
a
low
voice
to
consider
the
impropriety
of
these
circumstances
and
that
he
would
spare
her
the
mortification
of
submitting
to
them
he
however
was
inflexible
â€œthis
caprice
is
intolerableâ€
said
he
â€œand
shall
not
be
indulged
there
is
no
impropriety
in
the
caseâ€
at
this
moment
emilyâ€™s
dislike
of
count
morano
rose
to
abhorrence
that
he
should
with
undaunted
assurance
thus
pursue
her
notwithstanding
all
she
had
expressed
on
the
subject
of
his
addresses
and
think
as
it
was
evident
he
did
that
her
opinion
of
him
was
of
no
consequence
so
long
as
his
pretensions
were
sanctioned
by
montoni
added
indignation
to
the
disgust
which
she
had
felt
towards
him
she
was
somewhat
relieved
by
observing
that
montoni
was
to
be
of
the
party
who
seated
himself
on
one
side
of
her
while
morano
placed
himself
on
the
other
there
was
a
pause
for
some
moments
as
the
gondolieri
prepared
their
oars
and
emily
trembled
from
apprehension
of
the
discourse
that
might
follow
this
silence
at
length
she
collected
courage
to
break
it
herself
in
the
hope
of
preventing
fine
speeches
from
morano
and
reproof
from
montoni
to
some
trivial
remark
which
she
made
the
latter
returned
a
short
and
disobliging
reply
but
morano
immediately
followed
with
a
general
observation
which
he
contrived
to
end
with
a
particular
compliment
and
though
emily
passed
it
without
even
the
notice
of
a
smile
he
was
not
discouraged
â€œi
have
been
impatientâ€
said
he
addressing
emily
â€œto
express
my
gratitude
to
thank
you
for
your
goodness
but
i
must
also
thank
signor
montoni
who
has
allowed
me
this
opportunity
of
doing
soâ€
emily
regarded
the
count
with
a
look
of
mingled
astonishment
and
displeasure
â€œwhyâ€
continued
he
â€œshould
you
wish
to
diminish
the
delight
of
this
moment
by
that
air
of
cruel
reserveâ€”why
seek
to
throw
me
again
into
the
perplexities
of
doubt
by
teaching
your
eyes
to
contradict
the
kindness
of
your
late
declaration
you
cannot
doubt
the
sincerity
the
ardour
of
my
passion
it
is
therefore
unnecessary
charming
emily
surely
unnecessary
any
longer
to
attempt
a
disguise
of
your
sentimentsâ€
â€œif
i
ever
had
disguised
them
sirâ€
said
emily
with
recollected
spirit
â€œit
would
certainly
be
unnecessary
any
longer
to
do
so
i
had
hoped
sir
that
you
would
have
spared
me
any
farther
necessity
of
alluding
to
them
but
since
you
do
not
grant
this
hear
me
declare
and
for
the
last
time
that
your
perseverance
has
deprived
you
even
of
the
esteem
which
i
was
inclined
to
believe
you
meritedâ€
â€œastonishingâ€
exclaimed
montoni
â€œthis
is
beyond
even
my
expectation
though
i
have
hitherto
done
justice
to
the
caprice
of
the
sex
but
you
will
observe
mademoiselle
emily
that
i
am
no
lover
though
count
morano
is
and
that
i
will
not
be
made
the
amusement
of
your
capricious
moments
here
is
the
offer
of
an
alliance
which
would
do
honour
to
any
family
yours
you
will
recollect
is
not
noble
you
long
resisted
my
remonstrances
but
my
honour
is
now
engaged
and
it
shall
not
be
trifled
withâ€”you
shall
adhere
to
the
declaration
which
you
have
made
me
an
agent
to
convey
to
the
countâ€
â€œi
must
certainly
mistake
you
sirâ€
said
emily
â€œmy
answers
on
the
subject
have
been
uniform
it
is
unworthy
of
you
to
accuse
me
of
caprice
if
you
have
condescended
to
be
my
agent
it
is
an
honour
i
did
not
solicit
i
myself
have
constantly
assured
count
morano
and
you
also
sir
that
i
never
can
accept
the
honour
he
offers
me
and
i
now
repeat
the
declarationâ€
the
count
looked
with
an
air
of
surprise
and
enquiry
at
montoni
whose
countenance
also
was
marked
with
surprise
but
it
was
surprise
mingled
with
indignation
â€œhere
is
confidence
as
well
as
capriceâ€
said
the
latter
â€œwill
you
deny
your
own
words
madamâ€
â€œsuch
a
question
is
unworthy
of
an
answer
sirâ€
said
emily
blushing
â€œyou
will
recollect
yourself
and
be
sorry
that
you
have
asked
itâ€
â€œspeak
to
the
pointâ€
rejoined
montoni
in
a
voice
of
increasing
vehemence
â€œwill
you
deny
your
own
words
will
you
deny
that
you
acknowledged
only
a
few
hours
ago
that
it
was
too
late
to
recede
from
your
engagements
and
that
you
accepted
the
countâ€™s
handâ€
â€œi
will
deny
all
this
for
no
words

mine
ever
imported

â€œastonishing

you
deny
what
you
wrote
to
mons
quesnel
your
uncle
if
you
do
your
own
hand
will
bear
testimony
against
you
what
have
you
now
to
sayâ€
continued
montoni
observing
the
silence
and
confusion
of
emily
â€œi
now
perceive
sir
that
you
are
under
a
very
great
error
and
that
i
have
been
equally
mistakenâ€
â€œno
more
duplicity
i
entreat
be
open
and
candid
if
it
be
possibleâ€
â€œi
have
always
been
so
sir
and
can
claim
no
merit
in
such
conduct
for
i
have
had
nothing
to
concealâ€
â€œhow
is
this
signorâ€
cried
morano
with
trembling
emotion
â€œsuspend
your
judgment
countâ€
replied
montoni
â€œthe
wiles
of
a
female
heart
are
unsearchable
now
madame
your
explanationâ€
â€œexcuse
me
sir
if
i
withhold
my
explanation

you
appear
willing
to
give
me
your
confidence

present
can
only
subject
me
to
insultâ€
â€œyour

entreat
youâ€
said
morano
â€œwell
wellâ€
rejoined
montoni
â€œi
give
you
my
confidence
let
us
hear
this
explanationâ€
â€œlet
me
lead
to
it
then
by
asking
a
questionâ€
â€œas
many
as
you
pleaseâ€
said
montoni
contemptuously
â€œwhat
then
was
the
subject
of
your
letter
to
mons
quesnelâ€
â€œthe
same
that
was
the
subject
of
your
note
to
him
certainly
you
did
well
to
stipulate
for
my
confidence
before
you
demanded
that
questionâ€
â€œi
must
beg
you
will
be
more
explicit
sir
what
was
that
subjectâ€
â€œwhat
could
it
be
but
the
noble
offer
of
count
moranoâ€
said
montoni
â€œthen
sir
we
entirely
misunderstood
each
otherâ€
replied
emily
â€œwe
entirely
misunderstood
each
other
too
i
supposeâ€
rejoined
montoni
â€œin
the
conversation
which
preceded
the
writing
of
that
note
i
must
do
you
the
justice
to
own
that
you
are
very
ingenious
at
this
same
art
of
misunderstandingâ€
emily
tried
to
restrain
the
tears
that
came
to
her
eyes
and
to
answer
with
becoming
firmness
â€œallow
me
sir
to
explain
myself
fully
or
to
be
wholly
silentâ€
â€œthe
explanation
may
now
be
dispensed
with
it
is
anticipated
if
count
morano
still
thinks
one
necessary
i
will
give
him
an
honest
one
you
have
changed
your
intention
since
our
last
conversation
and
if
he
can
have
patience
and
humility
enough
to
wait
till
tomorrow
he
will
probably
find
it
changed
again
but
as
i
have
neither
the
patience
nor
the
humility
which
you
expect
from
a
lover
i
warn
you
of
the
effect
of
my
displeasureâ€
â€œmontoni
you
are
too
precipitateâ€
said
the
count
who
had
listened
to
this
conversation
in
extreme
agitation
and
impatienceâ€”â€œsignora
i
entreat
your
own
explanation
of
this
affairâ€
â€œsignor
montoni
has
said
justlyâ€
replied
emily
â€œthat
all
explanation
may
now
be
dispensed
with
after
what
has
passed
i
cannot
suffer
myself
to
give
one
it
is
sufficient
for
me
and
for
you
sir
that
i
repeat
my
late
declaration
let
me
hope
this
is
the
last
time
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
repeat
itâ€”i
never
can
accept
the
honour
of
your
allianceâ€
â€œcharming
emilyâ€
exclaimed
the
count
in
an
impassioned
tone
â€œlet
not
resentment
make
you
unjust
let
me
not
suffer
for
the
offence
of
montoniâ€”revokeâ€”â€
â€œoffenceâ€

montoniâ€”â€œcount
this

ridiculous
this

tyrantâ€
â€œyou
distract
me
signor

me
to

my

have
already
proved
insufficient
to

â€œall
conversation
on

sirâ€
said
emily
â€œis
worse
than
useless
since
it
can
bring
only
pain
to
each
of
us

â€œit
is
impossible
madam
that
i
can
thus
easily
resign
the
object
of
a
passion
which
is
the
delight
and
torment
of
my
lifeâ€”i
must
still
loveâ€”still
pursue
you
with
unremitting
ardourâ€”when
you
shall
be
convinced
of
the
strength
and

must
soften
into

it
either
deserve
or
obtain
the
esteem
you
solicit
thus
to
continue
a
persecution
from
which
i
have
no
present
means
of
escapingâ€
a
gleam
of
moonlight
that
fell
upon
moranoâ€™s
countenance
revealed
the
strong
emotions
of
his
soul
and
glancing
on
montoni
discovered
the
dark
resentment
which
contrasted
his
features
â€œby
heaven
this
is
too
muchâ€
suddenly
exclaimed
the
count
â€œsignor
montoni
you
treat
me
ill
it
is
from
you
that
i
shall
look
for
explanationâ€
â€œfrom
me
sir
you
shall
have
itâ€
muttered
montoni
â€œif
your
discernment
is
indeed
so
far
obscured
by
passion
as
to
make
explanation
necessary
and
for
you
madam
you
should
learn
that
a
man
of
honour
is
not
to
be
trifled
with
though
you
may
perhaps
with
impunity
treat
a
boy
like
a
puppetâ€
this
sarcasm
roused
the
pride
of
morano
and
the
resentment
which
he
had
felt
at
the
indifference
of
emily
being
lost
in
indignation
of
the
insolence
of
montoni
he
determined
to
mortify
him
by
defending
her
â€œthis
alsoâ€
said
he
replying
to
montoniâ€™s
last
words
â€œthis
also
shall
not
pass
unnoticed

bid
you
learn

that
you

misled
me

would

innocentâ€
â€œmisled

retorted
montoni
with
quickness
â€œis
my
conductâ€”my
wordâ€â€”then
pausing
while
he
seemed
endeavouring
to
restrain
the
resentment
that
flashed
in
his
eyes
in
the
next
moment
he
added
in
a
subdued
voice
â€œcount
morano
this
is
a
language
a
sort
of
conduct
to
which
i
am
not

â€œcondescend

not

montoni
smiled
contemptuously
and
emily
now
terrified
for
the
consequences
of
what
she
saw
and
heard
could
no
longer
be
silent
she
explained
the
whole
subject
upon
which
she
had
mistaken
montoni
in
the
morning
declaring
that
she
understood
him
to
have
consulted
her
solely
concerning
the
disposal
of
la
vallã©e
and
concluding
with
entreating
that
he
would
write
immediately
to
m
quesnel
and
rectify
the
mistake
but
montoni
either
was
or
affected
to
be
still
incredulous
and
count
morano
was
still
entangled
in
perplexity
while
she
was
speaking
however
the
attention
of
her
auditors
had
been
diverted
from
the
immediate
occasion
of
their
resentment
and
their
passion
consequently
became
less
montoni
desired
the
count
would
order
his
servants
to
row
back
to
venice
that
he
might
have
some
private
conversation
with
him
and
morano
somewhat
soothed
by
his
softened
voice
and
manner
and
eager
to
examine
into
the
full
extent
of
his
difficulties
complied
emily
comforted
by
this
prospect
of
release
employed
the
present
moments
in
endeavouring
with
conciliating
care
to
prevent
any
fatal
mischief
between
the
persons
who
so
lately
had
persecuted
and
insulted
her
her
spirits
revived
when
she
heard
once
more
the
voice
of
song
and
laughter
resounding
from
the
grand
canal
and
at
length
entered
again
between
its
stately
piazzas
the
zendaletto
stopped
at
montoniâ€™s
mansion
and
the
count
hastily
led
her
into
the
hall
where
montoni
took
his
arm
and
said
something
in
a
low
voice
on
which
morano
kissed
the
hand
he
held
notwithstanding
emilyâ€™s
effort
to
disengage
it
and
wishing
her
a
good
evening
with
an
accent
and
look
she
could
not
misunderstand
returned
to
his
zendaletto
with
montoni
emily
in
her
own
apartment
considered
with
intense
anxiety
all
the
unjust
and
tyrannical
conduct
of
montoni
the
dauntless
perseverance
of
morano
and
her
own
desolate
situation
removed
from
her
friends
and
country
she
looked
in
vain
to
valancourt
confined
by
his
profession
to
a
distant
kingdom
as
her
protector
but
it
gave
her
comfort
to
know
that
there
was
at
least
one
person
in
the
world
who
would
sympathise
in
her
afflictions
and
whose
wishes
would
fly
eagerly
to
release
her
yet
she
determined
not
to
give
him
unavailing
pain
by
relating
the
reasons
she
had
to
regret
the
having
rejected
his
better
judgment
concerning
montoni
reasons
however
which
could
not
induce
her
to
lament
the
delicacy
and
disinterested
affection
that
had
made
her
reject
his
proposal
for
a
clandestine
marriage
the
approaching
interview
with
her
uncle
she
regarded
with
some
degree
of
hope
for
she
determined
to
represent
to
him
the
distresses
of
her
situation
and
to
entreat
that
he
would
allow
her
to
return
to
france
with
him
and
madame
quesnel
then
suddenly
remembering
that
her
beloved
la
vallã©e
her
only
home
was
no
longer
at
her
command
her
tears
flowed
anew
and
she
feared
that
she
had
little
pity
to
expect
from
a
man
who
like
m
quesnel
could
dispose
of
it
without
deigning
to
consult
with
her
and
could
dismiss
an
aged
and
faithful
servant
destitute
of
either
support
or
asylum
but
though
it
was
certain
that
she
had
herself
no
longer
a
home
in
france
and
few
very
few
friends
there
she
determined
to
return
if
possible
that
she
might
be
released
from
the
power
of
montoni
whose
particularly
oppressive
conduct
towards
herself
and
general
character
as
to
others
were
justly
terrible
to
her
imagination
she
had
no
wish
to
reside
with
her
uncle
m
quesnel
since
his
behaviour
to
her
late
father
and
to
herself
had
been
uniformly
such
as
to
convince
her
that
in
flying
to
him
she
could
only
obtain
an
exchange
of
oppressors
neither
had
she
the
slightest
intention
of
consenting
to
the
proposal
of
valancourt
for
an
immediate
marriage
though
this
would
give
her
a
lawful
and
a
generous
protector
for
the
chief
reasons
which
had
formerly
influenced
her
conduct
still
existed
against
it
while
others
which
seemed
to
justify
the
step
would
not
be
done
away
and
his
interest
his
fame
were
at
all
times
too
dear
to
her
to
suffer
her
to
consent
to
a
union
which
at
this
early
period
of
their
lives
would
probably
defeat
both
one
sure
and
proper
asylum
however
would
still
be
open
to
her
in
france
she
knew
that
she
could
board
in
the
convent
where
she
had
formerly
experienced
so
much
kindness
and
which
had
an
affecting
and
solemn
claim
upon
her
heart
since
it
contained
the
remains
of
her
late
father
here
she
could
remain
in
safety
and
tranquillity
till
the
term
for
which
la
vallã©e
might
be
let
should
expire
or
till
the
arrangement
of
m
mottevilleâ€™s
affairs
enabled
her
so
far
to
estimate
the
remains
of
her
fortune
as
to
judge
whether
it
would
be
prudent
for
her
to
reside
there
concerning
montoniâ€™s
conduct
with
respect
to
his
letters
to
m
quesnel
she
had
many
doubts
however
he
might
be
at
first
mistaken
on
the
subject
she
much
suspected
that
he
wilfully
persevered
in
his
error
as
a
means
of
intimidating
her
into
a
compliance
with
his
wishes
of
uniting
her
to
count
morano
whether
this
was
or
was
not
the
fact
she
was
extremely
anxious
to
explain
the
affair
to
m
quesnel
and
looked
forward
with
a
mixture
of
impatience
hope
and
fear
to
her
approaching
visit
on
the
following
day
madame
montoni
being
alone
with
emily
introduced
the
mention
of
count
morano
by
expressing
her
surprise
that
she
had
not
joined
the
party
on
the
water
the
preceding
evening
and
at
her
abrupt
departure
to
venice
emily
then
related
what
had
passed
expressed
her
concern
for
the
mutual
mistake
that
had
occurred
between
montoni
and
herself
and
solicited
her
auntâ€™s
kind
offices
in
urging
him
to
give
a
decisive
denial
to
the
countâ€™s
further
addresses
but
she
soon
perceived
that
madame
montoni
had
not
been
ignorant
of
the
late
conversation
when
she
introduced
the
present
â€œyou
have
no
encouragement
to
expect
from
meâ€
said
her
aunt
â€œin
these
notions
i
have
already
given
my
opinion
on
the
subject
and
think
signor
montoni
right
in
enforcing
by
any
means
your
consent
if
young
persons
will
be
blind
to
their
interest
and
obstinately
oppose
it
why
the
greatest
blessings
they
can
have
are
friends
who
will
oppose
their
folly
pray
what
pretensions
of
any
kind
do
you
think
you
have
to
such
a
match
as
is
now
offered
youâ€
â€œnot
any
whatever
madamâ€
replied
emily
â€œand
therefore
at
least
suffer
me
to
be
happy
in
my
humilityâ€
â€œnay
niece
it
cannot
be
denied
that
you
have
pride
enough
my
poor
brother
your
father
had
his
share
of
pride
too
though
let
me
add
his
fortune
did
not
justify
itâ€
emily
somewhat
embarrassed
by
the
indignation
which
this
malevolent
allusion
to
her
father
excited
and
by
the
difficulty
of
rendering
her
answer
as
temperate
as
it
should
be
reprehensive
hesitated
for
some
moments
in
a
confusion
which
highly
gratified
her
aunt
at
length
she
said
â€œmy
fatherâ€™s
pride
madam
had
a
noble
objectâ€”the
happiness
which
he
knew
could
be
derived
only
from
goodness
knowledge
and
charity
as
it
never
consisted
in
his
superiority
in
point
of
fortune
to
some
persons
it
was
not
humbled
by
his
inferiority
in
that
respect
to
others
he
never
disdained
those
who
were
wretched
by
poverty
and
misfortune
he
did
sometimes
despise
persons
who
with
many
opportunities
of
happiness
rendered
themselves
miserable
by
vanity
ignorance
and
cruelty
i
shall
think
it
my
highest
glory
to
emulate
such
prideâ€
â€œi
do
not
pretend
to
understand
anything
of
these
high-flown
sentiments
niece
you
have
all
that
glory
to
yourself
i
would
teach
you
a
little
plain
sense
and
not
have
you
so
wise
as
to
despise
happinessâ€
â€œthat
would
indeed
not
be
wisdom
but
follyâ€
said
emily
â€œfor
wisdom
can
boast
no
higher
attainment
than
happiness
but
you
will
allow
madam
that
our
ideas
of
happiness
may
differ
i
cannot
doubt
that
you
wish
me
to
be
happy
but
i
must
fear
you
are
mistaken
in
the
means
of
making
me
soâ€
â€œi
cannot
boast
of
a
learned
education
niece
such
as
your
father
thought
proper
to
give
you
and
therefore
do
not
pretend
to
understand
all
these
fine
speeches
about
happiness
i
must
be
contented
to
understand
only
common
sense
and
happy
would
it
have
been
for
you
and
your
father
if
that
had
been
included
in
his
educationâ€
emily
was
too
much
shocked
by
these
reflections
on
her
fatherâ€™s
memory
to
despise
this
speech
as
it
deserved
madame
montoni
was
about
to
speak
but
emily
quitted
the
room
and
retired
to
her
own
where
the
little
spirit
she
had
lately
exerted
yielded
to
grief
and
vexation
and
left
her
only
to
her
tears
from
every
review
of
her
situation
she
could
derive
indeed
only
new
sorrow
to
the
discovery
which
had
just
been
forced
upon
her
of
montoniâ€™s
unworthiness
she
had
now
to
add
that
of
the
cruel
vanity
for
the
gratification
of
which
her
aunt
was
about
to
sacrifice
her
of
the
effrontery
and
cunning
with
which
at
the
time
that
she
meditated
the
sacrifice
she
boasted
of
her
tenderness
or
insulted
her
victim
and
of
the
venomous
envy
which
as
it
did
not
scruple
to
attack
her
fatherâ€™s
character
could
scarcely
be
expected
to
withhold
from
her
own
during
the
few
days
that
intervened
between
this
conversation
and
the
departure
for
miarenti
montoni
did
not
once
address
himself
to
emily
his
looks
sufficiently
declared
his
resentment
but
that
he
should
forbear
to
renew
a
mention
of
the
subject
of
it
exceedingly
surprised
her
who
was
no
less
astonished
that
during
three
days
count
morano
neither
visited
montoni
nor
was
named
by
him
several
conjectures
arose
in
her
mind
sometimes
she
feared
that
the
dispute
between
them
had
been
revived
and
had
ended
fatally
to
the
count
sometimes
she
was
inclined
to
hope
that
weariness
or
disgust
at
her
firm
rejection
of
his
suit
had
induced
him
to
relinquish
it
and
at
others
she
suspected
that
he
had
now
recourse
to
stratagem
and
forbore
his
visits
and
prevailed
with
montoni
to
forbear
the
repetition
of
his
name
in
the
expectation
that
gratitude
and
generosity
would
prevail
with
her
to
give
him
the
consent
which
he
could
not
hope
from
love
thus
passed
the
time
in
vain
conjecture
and
alternate
hopes
and
fears
till
the
day
arrived
when
montoni
was
to
set
out
for
the
villa
of
miarenti
which
like
the
preceding
ones
neither
brought
the
count
nor
the
mention
of
him
montoni
having
determined
not
to
leave
venice
till
towards
evening
that
he
might
avoid
the
heats
and
catch
the
cool
breezes
of
night
embarked
about
an
hour
before
sunset
with
his
family
in
a
barge
for
the
brenta
emily
sat
alone
near
the
stern
of
the
vessel
and
as
it
floated
slowly
on
watched
the
gay
and
lofty
city
lessening
from
her
view
till
its
palaces
seemed
to
sink
in
the
distant
waves
while
its
loftier
towers
and
domes
illumined
by
the
declining
sun
appeared
on
the
horizon
like
those
far-seen
clouds
which
in
more
northern
climes
often
linger
on
the
western
verge
and
catch
the
last
light
of
a
summerâ€™s
evening
soon
after
even
these
grew
dim
and
faded
in
distance
from
her
sight
but
she
still
sat
gazing
on
the
vast
scene
of
cloudless
sky
and
mighty
waters
and
listening
in
pleasing
awe
to
the
deep-sounding
waves
while
as
her
eyes
glanced
over
the
adriatic
towards
the
opposite
shores
which
were
however
far
beyond
the
reach
of
sight
she
thought
of
greece
and
a
thousand
classical
remembrances
stealing
to
her
mind
she
experienced
that
pensive
luxury
which
is
felt
on
viewing
the
scenes
of
ancient
story
and
on
comparing
their
present
state
of
silence
and
solitude
with
that
of
their
former
grandeur
and
animation
the
scenes
of
the
illiad
illapsed
in
glowing
colours
to
her
fancyâ€”scenes
once
the
haunt
of
heroesâ€”now
lonely
and
in
ruins
but
which
still
shone
in
the
poetâ€™s
strain
in
all
their
youthful
splendour
as
her
imagination
painted
with
melancholy
touches
the
deserted
plains
of
troy
such
as
they
appeared
in
this
after-day
she
reanimated
the
landscape
with
the
following
little
story
stanzas
oâ€™er
ilionâ€™s
plains
where
once
the
warrior
bled
and
once
the
poet
raisâ€™d
his
deathless
strain
oâ€™er
ilionâ€™s
plains
a
weary
driver
led
his
stately
camels
for
the
ruinâ€™d
fane
wide
round
the
lonely
scene
his
glance
he
threw
for
now
the
red
cloud
faded
in
the
west
and
twilight
oâ€™er
the
silent
landscape
drew
her
deepâ€™ning
veil
eastward
his
course
he
prest
there
on
the
grey
horizonâ€™s
glimmâ€™ring
bound
rose
the
proud
columns
of
deserted
troy
and
wandering
shepherds
now
a
shelter
found
within
those
walls
where
princes
wont
to
joy
beneath
a
lofty
porch

then
from
his
camels
heavâ€™d
the
heavy
load
partook
with
them
the
simple
cool
repast
and
in
short
vesper
gave
himself
to
god
from
distant
lands
with
merchandise
he
came
his
all
of
wealth
his
patient
servants
bore
oft
deep-drawn
sighs
his
anxious
wish

to
reach
again
his
happy
cottage
door
for
there
his

his

their
smiles

of

an

evâ€™n
now
warm
tears
to
expectation
swell
as
fancy
oâ€™er
his
mind
extends
her
powâ€™r
a
death-like
stillness
reignâ€™d
where
once
the
song
the
song
of
heroes
wakâ€™d
the
midnight
air
save
when
a
solemn
murmur
rollâ€™d
along
that
seemâ€™d
to
sayâ€”â€œfor
future
worlds
prepareâ€
for
timeâ€™s
imperious
voice
was
frequent
heard
shaking
the
marble
temple
to
its
fall
by
hands
he
long
had
conquerâ€™d
vainly
rearâ€™d
and
distant

answerâ€™d
to
his
call
while
hamet
slept
his
camels
round
him
lay
beneath
him
all
his
store
of
wealth
was
piled
and
here
his
cruse
and
empty
wallet
lay
and
there
the
flute
that
chearâ€™d
him
in
the
wild
the
robber
tartar
on
his
slumber
stole
for
oâ€™er
the
waste
at

he
watchâ€™d
his
train
ah
who
his
thirst
of
plunder
shall
control
who
calls
on
him
for
mercyâ€”calls
in
vain
a
poisonâ€™d
poignard
in
his
belt
he
wore
a
crescent
sword
depended
at
his
side
the
deathful
quiver
at
his
back
he
bore
and
infantsâ€”at
his
very
look
had
died
the
moonâ€™s
cold
beam
athwart
the
temple
fell
and
to
his
sleeping
prey
the
tartar
led
but
softâ€”a
startled
camel
shook
his
bell
then
stretchâ€™d
his
limbs
and
rearâ€™d
his
drowsy
head
hamet
awoke
the
poignard
glitterâ€™d
high
swift
from
his
couch
he
sprung
and
â€™scapâ€™d
the
blow
when
from
an
unknown
hand
the
arrows
fly
that
lay
the
ruffian
in
his
vengeance
low
he
groanâ€™d
he
died
from
forth
a
columnâ€™d
gate
a
fearful
shepherd
pale
and
silent
crept
who
as
he
watchâ€™d
his
folded
flock
star-late
had
markâ€™d
the
robber
steal
where
hamet
slept
he
fearâ€™d
his
own
and
savâ€™d
a
strangerâ€™s
life
poor
hamet
claspâ€™d
him
to
his
grateful
heart
then
rousâ€™d
his
camels
for
the
dusty
strife
and
with
the
shepherd
hastenâ€™d
to
depart
and
now
aurora
breathes
her
freshâ€™ning
gale
and
faintly
trembles
on
the
eastern
cloud
and
now
the
sun
from
under
twilightâ€™s
veil
looks
gaily
forth
and
melts
her
airy
shroud
wide
oâ€™er
the
level
plains
his
slanting
beams
dart
their
long
lines
on
ilionâ€™s
towerâ€™d
site
the

with
morning
gleams
and

his

so
gay
and

hametâ€™s
heart
for

eâ€™er
the
dim
evening
steals
upon
the
day
his
children
wife
and
happy
home
shall
see
as
emily
approached
the
shores
of
italy
she
began
to
discriminate
the
rich
features
and
varied
colouring
of
the
landscapeâ€”the
purple
hills
groves
of
orange
pine
and
cypress
shading
magnificent
villas
and
towns
rising
among
vineyards
and
plantations
the
noble
brenta
pouring
its
broad
waves
into
the
sea
now
appeared
and
when
she
reached
its
mouth
the
barge
stopped
that
the
horses
might
be
fastened
which
were
now
to
tow
it
up
the
stream
this
done
emily
gave
a
last
look
to
the
adriatic
and
to
the
dim
sail
that
from
the
sky-mixâ€™d
wave
dawns
on
the
sight
and
the
barge
slowly
glided
between
the
green
and
luxuriant
slopes
of
the
river
the
grandeur
of
the
palladian
villas
that
adorn
these
shores
was
considerably
heightened
by
the
setting
rays
which
threw
strong
contrasts
of
light
and
shade
upon
the
porticos
and
long
arcades
and
beamed
a
mellow
lustre
upon
the
orangeries
and
the
tall
groves
of
pine
and
cypress
that
overhung
the
buildings
the
scent
of
oranges
of
flowering
myrtles
and
other
odoriferous
plants
was
diffused
upon
the
air
and
often
from
these
embowered
retreats
a
strain
of
music
stole
on
the
calm
and
â€œsoftened
into
silenceâ€
the
sun
now
sunk
below
the
horizon
twilight
fell
over
the
landscape
and
emily
wrapt
in
musing
silence
continued
to
watch
its
features
gradually
vanishing
into
obscurity
she
remembered
her
many
happy
evenings
when
with
st
aubert
she
had
observed
the
shades
of
twilight
steal
over
a
scene
as
beautiful
as
this
from
the
gardens
of
la
vallã©e
and
a
tear
fell
to
the
memory
of
her
father
her
spirits
were
softened
into
melancholy
by
the
influence
of
the
hour
by
the
low
murmur
of
the
wave
passing
under
the
vessel
and
the
stillness
of
the
air
that
trembled
only
at
intervals
with
distant
musicâ€”why
else
should
she
at
these
moments
have
looked
on
her
attachment
to
valancourt
with
presages
so
very
afflicting
since
she
had
but
lately
received
letters
from
him
that
had
soothed
for
a
while
all
her
anxieties
it
now
seemed
to
her
oppressed
mind
that
she
had
taken
leave
of
him
for
ever
and
that
the
countries
which
separated
them
would
never
more
be
retraced
by
her
she
looked
upon
count
morano
with
horror
as
in
some
degree
the
cause
of
this
but
apart
from
him
a
conviction
if
such
that
may
be
called
which
arises
from
no
proof
and
which
she
knew
not
how
to
account
for
seized
her
mindâ€”that
she
should
never
see
valancourt
again
though
she
knew
that
neither
moranoâ€™s
solicitations
nor
montoniâ€™s
commands
had
lawful
power
to
enforce
her
obedience
she
regarded
both
with
a
superstitious
dread
that
they
would
finally
prevail
lost
in
this
melancholy
reverie
and
shedding
frequent
tears
emily
was
at
length
roused
by
montoni
and
she
followed
him
to
the
cabin
where
refreshments
were
spread
and
her
aunt
was
seated
alone
the
countenance
of
madame
montoni
was
inflamed
with
resentment
that
appeared
to
be
the
consequence
of
some
conversation
she
had
held
with
her
husband
who
regarded
her
with
a
kind
of
sullen
disdain
and
both
preserved
for
some
time
a
haughty
silence
montoni
then
spoke
to
emily
of
mons
quesnel
â€œyou
will
not
i
hope
persist
in
disclaiming
your
knowledge
of
the
subject
of
my
letter
to
himâ€
â€œi
had
hoped
sir
that
it
was
no
longer
necessary
for
me
to
disclaim
itâ€
said
emily
â€œi
had
hoped
from
your
silence
that
you
were
convinced
of
your
errorâ€
â€œyou
have
hoped
impossibilities
thenâ€
replied
montoni
â€œi
might
as
reasonably
have
expected
to
find
sincerity
and
uniformity
of
conduct
in
one
of
your
sex
as
you
to
convict
me
of
error
in
this
affairâ€
emily
blushed
and
was
silent
she
now
perceived
too
clearly
that
she
had
hoped
an
impossibility
for
where
no
mistake
had
been
committed
no
conviction
could
follow
and
it
was
evident
that
montoniâ€™s
conduct
had
not
been
the
consequence
of
mistake
but
of
design
anxious
to
escape
from
conversation
which
was
both
afflicting
and
humiliating
to
her
she
soon
returned
to
the
deck
and
resumed
her
station
near
the
stern
without
apprehension
of
cold
for
no
vapour
rose
from
the
water
and
the
air
was
dry
and
tranquil
here
at
least
the
benevolence
of
nature
allowed
her
the
quiet
which
montoni
had
denied
her
elsewhere
it
was
now
past
midnight
the
stars
shed
a
kind
of
twilight
that
served
to
show
the
dark
outline
of
the
shores
on
either
hand
and
the
grey
surface
of
the
river
till
the
moon
rose
from
behind
a
high
palm
grove
and
shed
her
mellow
lustre
over
the
scene
the
vessel
glided
smoothly
on
amid
the
stillness
of
the
hour
emily
heard
now
and
then
the
solitary
voice
of
the
barge-men
on
the
bank
as
they
spoke
to
their
horses
while
from
a
remote
part
of
the
vessel
with
melancholy
song
the
sailor
soothâ€™d
beneath
the
trembling
moon
the
midnight
wave
emily
meanwhile
anticipated
her
reception
by
mons
and
madame
quesnel
considered
what
she
should
say
on
the
subject
of
la
vallã©e
and
then
to
withhold
her
mind
from
more
anxious
topics
tried
to
amuse
herself
by
discriminating
the
faint-drawn
features
of
the
landscape
reposing
in
the
moonlight
while
her
fancy
thus
wandered
she
saw
at
a
distance
a
building
peeping
between
the
moonlight
trees
and
as
the
barge
approached
heard
voices
speaking
and
soon
distinguished
the
lofty
portico
of
a
villa
overshadowed
by
groves
of
pine
and
sycamore
which
she
recollected
to
be
the
same
that
had
formerly
been
pointed
out
to
her
as
belonging
to
madame
quesnelâ€™s
relative
the
barge
stopped
at
a
flight
of
marble
steps
which
led
up
the
bank
to
a
lawn
lights
appeared
between
some
pillars
beyond
the
portico
montoni
sent
forward
his
servant
and
then
disembarked
with
his
family
they
found
mons
and
madame
quesnel
with
a
few
friends
seated
on
sofas
in
the
portico
enjoying
the
cool
breeze
of
the
night
and
eating
fruits
and
ices
while
some
of
their
servants
at
a
little
distance
on
the
riverâ€™s
bank
were
performing
a
simple
serenade
emily
was
now
accustomed
to
the
way
of
living
in
this
warm
country
and
was
not
surprised
to
find
mons
and
madame
quesnel
in
their
portico
two
hours
after
midnight
the
usual
salutations
being
over
the
company
seated
themselves
in
the
portico
and
refreshments
were
brought
them
from
the
adjoining
hall
where
a
banquet
was
spread
and
servants
attended
when
the
bustle
of
this
meeting
had
subsided
and
emily
had
recovered
from
the
little
flutter
into
which
it
had
thrown
her
spirits
she
was
struck
with
the
singular
beauty
of
the
hall
so
perfectly
accommodated
to
the
luxuries
of
the
season
it
was
of
white
marble
and
the
roof
rising
into
an
open
cupola
was
supported
by
columns
of
the
same
material
two
opposite
sides
of
the
apartment
terminating
in
open
porticos
admitted
to
the
hall
a
full
view
of
the
gardens
and
of
the
river
scenery
in
the
centre
a
fountain
continually
refreshed
the
air
and
seemed
to
heighten
the
fragrance
that
breathed
from
the
surrounding
orangeries
while
its
dashing
waters
gave
an
agreeable
and
soothing
sound
etruscan
lamps
suspended
from
the
pillars
diffused
a
brilliant
light
over
the
interior
part
of
the
hall
leaving
the
remoter
porticos
to
the
softer
lustre
of
the
moon
mons
quesnel
talked
apart
to
montoni
of
his
own
affairs
in
his
usual
strain
of
self-importance
boasted
of
his
new
acquisitions
and
then
affected
to
pity
some
disappointments
which
montoni
had
lately
sustained
meanwhile
the
latter
whose
pride
at
least
enabled
him
to
despise
such
vanity
as
this
and
whose
discernment
at
once
detected
under
this
assumed
pity
the
frivolous
malignity
of
quesnelâ€™s
mind
listened
to
him
in
contemptuous
silence
till
he
named
his
niece
and
then
they
left
the
portico
and
walked
away
into
the
gardens
emily
however
still
attended
to
madame
quesnel
who
spoke
of
france
for
even
the
name
of
her
native
country
was
dear
to
her
and
she
found
some
pleasure
in
looking
at
a
person
who
had
lately
been
in
it
that
country
too
was
inhabited
by
valancourt
and
she
listened
to
the
mention
of
it
with
a
faint
hope
that
he
also
would
be
named
madame
quesnel
who
when
she
was
in
france
had
talked
with
rapture
of
italy
now
that
she
was
in
italy
talked
with
equal
praise
of
france
and
endeavoured
to
excite
the
wonder
and
the
envy
of
her
auditors
by
accounts
of
places
which
they
had
not
been
happy
enough
to
see
in
these
descriptions
she
not
only
imposed
upon
them
but
upon
herself
for
she
never
thought
a
present
pleasure
equal
to
one
that
was
passed
and
thus
the
delicious
climate
the
fragrant
orangeries
and
all
the
luxuries
which
surrounded
her
slept
unnoticed
while
her
fancy
wandered
over
the
distant
scenes
of
a
northern
country
emily
listened
in
vain
for
the
name
of
valancourt
madame
montoni
spoke
in
her
turn
of
the
delights
of
venice
and
of
the
pleasure
she
expected
from
visiting
the
fine
castle
of
montoni
on
the
apennine
which
latter
mention
at
least
was
merely
a
retaliating
boast
for
emily
well
knew
that
her
aunt
had
no
taste
for
solitary
grandeur
and
particularly
for
such
as
the
castle
of
udolpho
promised
thus
the
party
continued
to
converse
and
as
far
as
civility
would
permit
to
torture
each
other
by
mutual
boasts
while
they
reclined
on
sofas
in
the
portico
and
were
environed
with
delights
both
from
nature
and
art
by
which
any
honest
minds
would
have
been
tempered
to
benevolence
and
happy
imaginations
would
have
been
soothed
into
enchantment
the
dawn
soon
after
trembled
in
the
eastern
horizon
and
the
light
tints
of
morning
gradually
expanding
showed
the
beautifully
declining
forms
of
the
italian
mountains
and
the
gleaming
landscapes
stretched
at
their
feet
then
the
sunbeams
shooting
up
from
behind
the
hills
spread
over
the
scene
that
fine
saffron
tinge
which
seems
to
impart
repose
to
all
it
touches
the
landscape
no
longer
gleamed
all
its
glowing
colours
were
revealed
except
that
its
remoter
features
were
still
softened
and
united
in
the
mist
of
distance
whose
sweet
effect
was
heightened
to
emily
by
the
dark
verdure
of
the
pines
and
cypresses
that
over-arched
the
foreground
of
the
river
the
market
people
passing
with
their
boats
to
venice
now
formed
a
moving
picture
on
the
brenta
most
of
these
had
little
painted
awnings
to
shelter
their
owners
from
the
sunbeams
which
together
with
the
piles
of
fruit
and
flowers
displayed
beneath
and
the
tasteful
simplicity
of
the
peasant
girls
who
watched
the
rural
treasures
rendered
them
gay
and
striking
objects
the
swift
movement
of
the
boats
down
the
current
the
quick
glance
of
oars
in
the
water
and
now
and
then
the
passing
chorus
of
peasants
who
reclined
under
the
sail
of
their
little
bark
or
the
tones
of
some
rustic
instrument
played
by
a
girl
as
she
sat
near
her
sylvan
cargo
heightened
the
animation
and
festivity
of
the
scene
when
montoni
and
m
quesnel
had
joined
the
ladies
the
party
left
the
portico
for
the
gardens
where
the
charming
scenery
soon
withdrew
emilyâ€™s
thoughts
from
painful
subjects
the
majestic
forms
and
rich
verdure
of
cypresses
she
had
never
seen
so
perfect
before
groves
of
cedar
lemon
and
orange
the
spiry
clusters
of
the
pine
and
poplar
the
luxuriant
chesnut
and
oriental
plane
threw
all
their
pomp
of
shade
over
these
gardens
while
bowers
of
flowering
myrtle
and
other
spicy
shrubs
mingled
their
fragrance
with
that
of
flowers
whose
vivid
and
various
colouring
glowed
with
increased
effect
beneath
the
contrasted
umbrage
of
the
groves
the
air
also
was
continually
refreshed
by
rivulets
which
with
more
taste
than
fashion
had
been
suffered
to
wander
among
the
green
recesses
emily
often
lingered
behind
the
party
to
contemplate
the
distant
landscape
that
closed
a
vista
or
that
gleamed
beneath
the
dark
foliage
of
the
foregroundâ€”the
spiral
summits
of
the
mountains
touched
with
a
purple
tint
broken
and
steep
above
but
shelving
gradually
to
their
base
the
open
valley
marked
by
no
formal
lines
of
art
and
the
tall
groves
of
cypress
pine
and
poplar
sometimes
embellished
by
a
ruined
villa
whose
broken
columns
appeared
between
the
branches
of
a
pine
that
seemed
to
droop
over
their
fall
from
other
parts
of
the
gardens
the
character
of
the
view
was
entirely
changed
and
the
fine
solitary
beauty
of
the
landscape
shifted
for
the
crowded
features
and
varied
colouring
of
inhabitation
the
sun
was
now
gaining
fast
upon
the
sky
and
the
party
quitted
the
gardens
and
retired
to
repose
and
poor
misfortune
feels
the
lash
of
vice
thomson
emily
seized
the
first
opportunity
of
conversing
alone
with
mons
quesnel
concerning
la
vallã©e
his
answers
to
her
enquiries
were
concise
and
delivered
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
conscious
of
possessing
absolute
power
and
impatient
of
hearing
it
questioned
he
declared
that
the
disposal
of
the
place
was
a
necessary
measure
and
that
she
might
consider
herself
indebted
to
his
prudence
for
even
the
small
income
that
remained
for
her
â€œbut
howeverâ€
added
he
â€œwhen
this
venetian
count
i
have
forgot
his
name
marries
you
your
present
disagreeable
state
of
dependence
will
cease
as
a
relation
to
you
i
rejoice
in
the
circumstance
which
is
so
fortunate
for
you
and
i
may
add
so
unexpected
by
your
friendsâ€
for
some
moments
emily
was
chilled
into
silence
by
this
speech
and
when
she
attempted
to
undeceive
him
concerning
the
purport
of
the
note
she
had
inclosed
in
montoniâ€™s
letter
he
appeared
to
have
some
private
reason
for
disbelieving
her
assertion
and
for
a
considerable
time
persevered
in
accusing
her
of
capricious
conduct
being
at
length
however
convinced
that
she
really
disliked
morano
and
had
positively
rejected
his
suit
his
resentment
was
extravagant
and
he
expressed
it
in
terms
equally
pointed
and
inhuman
for
secretly
flattered
by
the
prospect
of
a
connection
with
a
nobleman
whose
title
he
had
affected
to
forget
he
was
incapable
of
feeling
pity
for
whatever
sufferings
of
his
niece
might
stand
in
the
way
of
his
ambition
emily
saw
at
once
in
his
manner
all
the
difficulties
that
awaited
her
and
though
no
oppression
could
have
power
to
make
her
renounce
valancourt
for
morano
her
fortitude
now
trembled
at
an
encounter
with
the
violent
passions
of
her
uncle
she
opposed
his
turbulence
and
indignation
only
by
the
mild
dignity
of
a
superior
mind
but
the
gentle
firmness
of
her
conduct
served
to
exasperate
still
more
his
resentment
since
it
compelled
him
to
feel
his
own
inferiority
and
when
he
left
her
he
declared
that
if
she
persisted
in
her
folly
both
himself
and
montoni
would
abandon
her
to
the
contempt
of
the
world
the
calmness
she
had
assumed
in
his
presence
failed
emily
when
alone
and
she
wept
bitterly
and
called
frequently
upon
the
name
of
her
departed
father
whose
advice
to
her
from
his
death-bed
she
then
remembered
â€œalasâ€
said
she
â€œi
do
indeed
perceive
how
much
more
valuable
is
the
strength
of
fortitude
than
the
grace
of
sensibility
and
i
will
also
endeavour
to
fulfil
the
promise
i
then
made
i
will
not
indulge
in
unavailing
lamentation
but
will
try
to
endure
with
firmness
the
oppression
i
cannot
eludeâ€
somewhat
soothed
by
the
consciousness
of
performing
a
part
of
st
aubertâ€™s
last
request
and
of
endeavouring
to
pursue
the
conduct
which
he
would
have
approved
she
overcame
her
tears
and
when
the
company
met
at
dinner
had
recovered
her
usual
serenity
of
countenance
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
the
ladies
took
the
fresco
along
the
bank
of
the
brenta
in
madame
quesnelâ€™s
carriage
the
state
of
emilyâ€™s
mind
was
in
melancholy
contrast
with
the
gay
groups
assembled
beneath
the
shades
that
overhung
this
enchanting
stream
some
were
dancing
under
the
trees
and
others
reclining
on
the
grass
taking
ices
and
coffee
and
calmly
enjoying
the
effect
of
a
beautiful
evening
on
a
luxuriant
landscape
emily
when
she
looked
at
the
snow-capped
apennines
ascending
in
the
distance
thought
of
montoniâ€™s
castle
and
suffered
some
terror
lest
he
should
convey
her
thither
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
her
obedience
but
the
thought
vanished
when
she
considered
that
she
was
as
much
in
his
power
at
venice
as
she
could
be
elsewhere
it
was
moonlight
before
the
party
returned
to
the
villa
where
supper
was
spread
in
the
airy
hall
which
had
so
much
enchanted
emilyâ€™s
fancy
on
the
preceding
night
the
ladies
seated
themselves
in
the
portico
till
mons
quesnel
montoni
and
other
gentlemen
should
join
them
at
table
and
emily
endeavoured
to
resign
herself
to
the
tranquillity
of
the
hour
presently
a
barge
stopped
at
the
steps
that
led
into
the
gardens
and
soon
after
she
distinguished
the
voices
of
montoni
and
quesnel
and
then
that
of
morano
who
in
the
next
moment
appeared
his
compliments
she
received
in
silence
and
her
cold
air
seemed
at
first
to
discompose
him
but
he
soon
recovered
his
usual
gaiety
of
manner
though
the
officious
kindness
of
m
and
madame
quesnel
emily
perceived
disgusted
him
such
a
degree
of
attention
she
had
scarcely
believed
could
be
shown
by
m
quesnel
for
she
had
never
before
seen
him
otherwise
than
in
the
presence
of
his
inferiors
or
equals
when
she
could
retire
to
her
own
apartment
her
mind
almost
involuntarily
dwelt
on
the
most
probable
means
of
prevailing
with
the
count
to
withdraw
his
suit
and
to
her
liberal
mind
none
appeared
more
probable
than
that
of
acknowledging
to
him
a
prior
attachment
and
throwing
herself
upon
his
generosity
for
a
release
when
however
on
the
following
day
he
renewed
his
addresses
she
shrunk
from
the
adoption
of
the
plan
she
had
formed
there
was
something
so
repugnant
to
her
just
pride
in
laying
open
the
secret
of
her
heart
to
such
a
man
as
morano
and
in
suing
to
him
for
compassion
that
she
impatiently
rejected
this
design
and
wondered
that
she
could
have
paused
upon
it
for
a
moment
the
rejection
of
his
suit
she
repeated
in
the
most
decisive
terms
she
could
select
mingling
with
it
a
severe
censure
of
his
conduct
but
though
the
count
appeared
mortified
by
this
he
persevered
in
the
most
ardent
professions
of
admiration
till
he
was
interrupted
and
emily
released
by
the
presence
of
madame
quesnel
during
her
stay
at
this
pleasant
villa
emily
was
thus
rendered
miserable
by
the
assiduities
of
morano
together
with
the
cruelly
exerted
authority
of
m
quesnel
and
montoni
who
with
her
aunt
seemed
now
more
resolutely
determined
upon
this
marriage
than
they
had
even
appeared
to
be
at
venice
m
quesnel
finding
that
both
argument
and
menace
were
ineffectual
in
enforcing
an
immediate
conclusion
to
it
at
length
relinquished
his
endeavours
and
trusted
to
the
power
of
montoni
and
to
the
course
of
events
at
venice
emily
indeed
looked
to
venice
with
hope
for
there
she
would
be
relieved
in
some
measure
from
the
persecution
of
morano
who
would
no
longer
be
an
inhabitant
of
the
same
house
with
herself
and
from
that
of
montoni
whose
engagements
would
not
permit
him
to
be
continually
at
home
but
amidst
the
pressure
of
her
own
misfortunes
she
did
not
forget
those
of
poor
theresa
for
whom
she
pleaded
with
courageous
tenderness
to
quesnel
who
promised
in
slight
and
general
terms
that
she
should
not
be
forgotten
montoni
in
a
long
conversation
with
m
quesnel
arranged
the
plan
to
be
pursued
respecting
emily
and
m
quesnel
proposed
to
be
at
venice
as
soon
as
he
should
be
informed
that
the
nuptials
were
concluded
it
was
new
to
emily
to
part
with
any
person
with
whom
she
was
connected
without
feeling
of
regret
the
moment
however
in
which
she
took
leave
of
m
and
madame
quesnel
was
perhaps
the
only
satisfactory
one
she
had
known
in
their
presence
morano
returned
in
montoniâ€™s
barge
and
emily
as
she
watched
her
gradual
approach
to
that
magic
city
saw
at
her
side
the
only
person
who
occasioned
her
to
view
it
with
less
than
perfect
delight
they
arrived
there
about
midnight
when
emily
was
released
from
the
presence
of
the
count
who
with
montoni
went
to
a
casino
and
she
was
suffered
to
retire
to
her
own
apartment
on
the
following
day
montoni
in
a
short
conversation
which
he
held
with
emily
informed
her
that
he
would
no
longer
be
trifled
with
and
that
since
her
marriage
with
the
count
would
be
so
highly
advantageous
to
her
that
folly
only
could
object
to
it
and
folly
of
such
extent
as
was
incapable
of
conviction
it
should
be
celebrated
without
further
delay
and
if
that
was
necessary
without
her
consent
emily
who
had
hitherto
tried
remonstrance
had
now
recourse
to
supplication
for
distress
prevented
her
from
foreseeing
that
with
a
man
of
montoniâ€™s
disposition
supplication
would
be
equally
useless
she
afterwards
enquired
by
what
right
he
exerted
this
unlimited
authority
over
her
a
question
which
her
better
judgment
would
have
withheld
her
in
a
calmer
moment
from
making
since
it
could
avail
her
nothing
and
would
afford
montoni
another
opportunity
of
triumphing
over
her
defenceless
condition
â€œby
what
rightâ€
cried
montoni
with
a
malicious
smile
â€œby
the
right
of
my
will
if
you
can
elude
that
i
will
not
inquire
by
what
right
you
do
so
i
now
remind
you
for
the
last
time
that
you
are
a
stranger
in
a
foreign
country
and
that
it
is
your
interest
to
make
me
your
friend
you
know
the
means
if
you
compel
me
to
become
your
enemyâ€”i
will
venture
to
tell
you
that
the
punishment
shall
exceed
your
expectation
you
may
know
i
am
not
to
be
trifled
withâ€
emily
continued
for
some
time
after
montoni
had
left
her
in
a
state
of
despair
or
rather
stupefaction
a
consciousness
of
misery
was
all
that
remained
in
her
mind
in
this
situation
madame
montoni
found
her
at
the
sound
of
whose
voice
emily
looked
up
and
her
aunt
somewhat
softened
by
the
expression
of
despair
that
fixed
her
countenance
spoke
in
a
manner
more
kind
than
she
had
ever
yet
done
emilyâ€™s
heart
was
touched
she
shed
tears
and
after
weeping
for
some
time
recovered
sufficient
composure
to
speak
on
the
subject
of
her
distress
and
to
endeavour
to
interest
madame
montoni
in
her
behalf
but
though
the
compassion
of
her
aunt
had
been
surprised
her
ambition
was
not
to
be
overcome
and
her
present
object
was
to
be
the
aunt
of
a
countess
emilyâ€™s
efforts
therefore
were
as
unsuccessful
as
they
had
been
with
montoni
and
she
withdrew
to
her
apartment
to
think
and
weep
alone
how
often
did
she
remember
the
parting
scene
with
valancourt
and
wish
that
the
italian
had
mentioned
montoniâ€™s
character
with
less
reserve
when
her
mind
however
had
recovered
from
the
first
shock
of
this
behaviour
she
considered
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
compel
her
alliance
with
morano
if
she
persisted
in
refusing
to
repeat
any
part
of
the
marriage
ceremony
and
she
persevered
in
her
resolution
to
await
montoniâ€™s
threatened
vengeance
rather
than
give
herself
for
life
to
a
man
whom
she
must
have
despised
for
his
present
conduct
had
she
never
even
loved
valancourt
yet
she
trembled
at
the
revenge
she
thus
resolved
to
brave
an
affair
however
soon
after
occurred
which
somewhat
called
off
montoniâ€™s
attention
from
emily
the
mysterious
visits
of
orsino
were
renewed
with
more
frequency
since
the
return
of
the
former
to
venice
there
were
others
also
besides
orsino
admitted
to
these
midnight
councils
and
among
them
cavigni
and
verezzi
montoni
became
more
reserved
and
austere
in
his
manner
than
ever
and
emily
if
her
own
interests
had
not
made
her
regardless
of
his
might
have
perceived
that
something
extraordinary
was
working
in
his
mind
one
night
on
which
a
council
was
not
held
orsino
came
in
great
agitation
of
spirits
and
dispatched
his
confidential
servant
to
montoni
who
was
at
a
casino
desiring
that
he
would
return
home
immediately
but
charging
the
servant
not
to
mention
his
name
montoni
obeyed
the
summons
and
on
meeting
orsino
was
informed
of
the
circumstances
that
occasioned
his
visit
and
his
visible
alarm
with
a
part
of
which
he
was
already
acquainted
a
venetian
nobleman
who
had
on
some
late
occasion
provoked
the
hatred
of
orsino
had
been
way-laid
and
poniarded
by
hired
assassins
and
as
the
murdered
person
was
of
the
first
connections
the
senate
had
taken
up
the
affair
one
of
the
assassins
was
now
apprehended
who
had
confessed
that
orsino
was
his
employer
in
the
atrocious
deed
and
the
latter
informed
of
his
danger
had
now
come
to
montoni
to
consult
on
the
measures
necessary
to
favour
his
escape
he
knew
that
at
this
time
the
officers
of
the
police
were
upon
the
watch
for
him
all
over
the
city
to
leave
it
at
present
therefore
was
impracticable
and
montoni
consented
to
secrete
him
for
a
few
days
till
the
vigilance
of
justice
should
relax
and
then
to
assist
him
in
quitting
venice
he
knew
the
danger
he
himself
incurred
by
permitting
orsino
to
remain
in
his
house
but
such
was
the
nature
of
his
obligations
to
this
man
that
he
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
refuse
him
an
asylum
such
was
the
person
whom
montoni
had
admitted
to
his
confidence
and
for
whom
he
felt
as
much
friendship
as
was
compatible
with
his
character
while
orsino
remained
concealed
in
his
house
montoni
was
unwilling
to
attract
public
observation
by
the
nuptials
of
count
morano
but
this
obstacle
was
in
a
few
days
overcome
by
the
departure
of
his
criminal
visitor
and
he
then
informed
emily
that
her
marriage
was
to
be
celebrated
on
the
following
morning
to
her
repeated
assurances
that
it
should
not
take
place
he
replied
only
by
a
malignant
smile
and
telling
her
that
the
count
and
a
priest
would
be
at
his
house
early
in
the
morning
he
advised
her
no
further
to
dare
his
resentment
by
opposition
to
his
will
and
to
her
own
interest
â€œi
am
now
going
out
for
the
eveningâ€
said
he
â€œremember
that
i
shall
give
your
hand
to
count
morano
in
the
morningâ€
emily
having
ever
since
his
late
threats
expected
that
her
trials
would
at
length
arrive
to
this
crisis
was
less
shocked
by
the
declaration
that
she
otherwise
would
have
been
and
she
endeavoured
to
support
herself
by
the
belief
that
the
marriage
could
not
be
valid
so
long
as
she
refused
before
the
priest
to
repeat
any
part
of
the
ceremony
yet
as
the
moment
of
trial
approached
her
long-harassed
spirits
shrunk
almost
equally
from
the
encounter
of
his
vengeance
and
from
the
hand
of
count
morano
she
was
not
even
perfectly
certain
of
the
consequence
of
her
steady
refusal
at
the
altar
and
she
trembled
more
than
ever
at
the
power
of
montoni
which
seemed
unlimited
as
his
will
for
she
saw
that
he
would
not
scruple
to
transgress
any
law
if
by
so
doing
he
could
accomplish
his
project
while
her
mind
was
thus
suffering
and
in
a
state
little
short
of
distraction
she
was
informed
that
morano
asked
permission
to
see
her
and
the
servant
had
scarcely
departed
with
an
excuse
before
she
repented
that
she
had
sent
one
in
the
next
moment
reverting
to
her
former
design
and
determining
to
try
whether
expostulation
and
entreaty
would
not
succeed
where
a
refusal
and
a
just
disdain
had
failed
she
recalled
the
servant
and
sending
a
different
message
prepared
to
go
down
to
the
count
the
dignity
and
assumed
composure
with
which
she
met
him
and
the
kind
of
pensive
resignation
that
softened
her
countenance
were
circumstances
not
likely
to
induce
him
to
relinquish
her
serving
as
they
did
to
heighten
a
passion
which
had
already
intoxicated
his
judgment
he
listened
to
all
she
said
with
an
appearance
of
complacency
and
of
a
wish
to
oblige
her
but
his
resolution
remained
invariably
the
same
and
he
endeavoured
to
win
her
admiration
by
every
insinuating
art
he
so
well
knew
how
to
practise
being
at
length
assured
that
she
had
nothing
to
hope
from
his
justice
she
repeated
in
a
solemn
and
impressive
manner
her
absolute
rejection
of
his
suit
and
quitted
him
with
an
assurance
that
her
refusal
would
be
effectually
maintained
against
every
circumstance
that
could
be
imagined
for
subduing
it
a
just
pride
had
restrained
her
tears
in
his
presence
but
now
they
flowed
from
the
fulness
of
her
heart
she
often
called
upon
the
name
of
her
late
father
and
often
dwelt
with
unutterable
anguish
on
the
idea
of
valancourt
she
did
not
go
down
to
supper
but
remained
alone
in
her
apartment
sometimes
yielding
to
the
influence
of
grief
and
terror
and
at
others
endeavouring
to
fortify
her
mind
against
them
and
to
prepare
herself
to
meet
with
composed
courage
the
scene
of
the
following
morning
when
all
the
stratagem
of
morano
and
the
violence
of
montoni
would
be
united
against
her
the
evening
was
far
advanced
when
madame
montoni
came
to
her
chamber
with
some
bridal
ornaments
which
the
count
had
sent
to
emily
she
had
this
day
purposely
avoided
her
niece
perhaps
because
her
usual
insensibility
failed
her
and
she
feared
to
trust
herself
with
a
view
of
emilyâ€™s
distress
or
possibly
though
her
conscience
was
seldom
audible
it
now
reproached
her
with
her
conduct
to
her
brotherâ€™s
orphan
child
whose
happiness
had
been
entrusted
to
her
care
by
a
dying
father
emily
could
not
look
at
these
presents
and
made
a
last
though
almost
hopeless
effort
to
interest
the
compassion
of
madame
montoni
who
if
she
did
feel
any
degree
of
pity
or
remorse
successfully
concealed
it
and
reproached
her
niece
with
folly
in
being
miserable
concerning
a
marriage
which
ought
only
to
make
her
happy
â€œi
am
sureâ€
said
she
â€œif
i
was
unmarried
and
the
count
had
proposed
to
me
i
should
have
been
flattered
by
the
distinction
and
if
i
should
have
been
so
i
am
sure
niece
you
who
have
no
fortune
ought
to
feel
yourself
highly
honoured
and
show
a
proper
gratitude
and
humility
towards
the
count
for
his
condescension
i
am
often
surprised
i
must
own
to
observe
how
humbly
he
deports
himself
to
you
notwithstanding
the
haughty
airs
you
give
yourself
i
wonder
he
has
patience
to
humour
you
so
if
i
was
he
i
know
i
should
often
be
ready
to
reprehend
you
and
make
you
know
yourself
a
little
better
i
would
not
have
flattered
you
i
can
tell
you
for
it
is
this
absurd
flattery
that
makes
you
fancy
yourself
of
so
much
consequence
that
you
think
nobody
can
deserve
you
and
i
often
tell
the
count
so
for
i
have
no
patience
to
hear
him
pay
you
such
extravagant
compliments
which
you
believe
every
word
ofâ€
â€œyour
patience
madam
cannot
suffer
more
cruelly
on
such
occasions
than
my
ownâ€
said
emily
â€œo
that
is
all
mere
affectationâ€
rejoined
her
aunt
â€œi
know
that
his
flattery
delights
you
and
makes
you
so
vain
that
you
think
you
may
have
the
whole
world
at
your
feet
but
you
are
very
much
mistaken
i
can
assure
you
niece
you
will
not
meet
with
many
such
suitors
as
the
count
every
other
person
would
have
turned
upon
his
heel
and
left
you
to
repent
at
your
leisure
long
agoâ€
â€œo
that
the
count
had
resembled
every
other
person
thenâ€
said
emily
with
a
heavy
sigh
â€œit
is
happy
for
you
that
he
does
notâ€
rejoined
madame
montoni
â€œand
what
i
am
now
saying
is
from
pure
kindness
i
am
endeavouring
to
convince
you
of
your
good
fortune
and
to
persuade
you
to
submit
to
necessity
with
a
good
grace
it
is
nothing
to
me
you
know
whether
you
like
this
marriage
or
not
for
it
must
be
what
i
say
therefore
is
from
pure
kindness
i
wish
to
see
you
happy
and
it
is
your
own
fault
if
you
are
not
so
i
would
ask
you
now
seriously
and
calmly
what
kind
of
a
match
you
can
expect
since
a
count
cannot
content
your
ambitionâ€
â€œi
have
no
ambition
whatever
madamâ€
replied
emily
â€œmy
only
wish
is
to
remain
in
my
present
stationâ€
â€œo
that
is
speaking
quite
from
the
purposeâ€
said
her
aunt
â€œi
see
you
are
still
thinking
of
mons
valancourt
pray
get
rid
of
all
those
fantastic
notions
about
love
and
this
ridiculous
pride
and
be
something
like
a
reasonable
creature
but
however
this
is
nothing
to
the
purposeâ€”for
your
marriage
with
the
count
takes
place
tomorrow
you
know
whether
you
approve
it
or
not
the
count
will
be
trifled
with
no
longerâ€
emily
made
no
attempt
to
reply
to
this
curious
speech
she
felt
it
would
be
mean
and
she
knew
it
would
be
useless
madame
montoni
laid
the
countâ€™s
presents
upon
the
table
on
which
emily
was
leaning
and
then
desiring
she
would
be
ready
early
in
the
morning
bade
her
good-night
â€œgood-night
madamâ€
said
emily
with
a
deep
sigh
as
the
door
closed
upon
her
aunt
and
she
was
left
once
more
to
her
own
sad
reflections
for
some
time
she
sat
so
lost
in
thought
as
to
be
wholly
unconscious
where
she
was
at
length
raising
her
head
and
looking
round
the
room
its
gloom
and
profound
stillness
awed
her
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
door
through
which
her
aunt
had
disappeared
and
listened
anxiously
for
some
sound
that
might
relieve
the
deep
dejection
of
her
spirits
but
it
was
past
midnight
and
all
the
family
except
the
servant
who
sat
up
for
montoni
had
retired
to
bed
her
mind
long
harassed
by
distress
now
yielded
to
imaginary
terrors
she
trembled
to
look
into
the
obscurity
of
her
spacious
chamber
and
feared
she
knew
not
what
a
state
of
mind
which
continued
so
long
that
she
would
have
called
up
annette
her
auntâ€™s
woman
had
her
fears
permitted
her
to
rise
from
her
chair
and
to
cross
the
apartment
these
melancholy
illusions
at
length
began
to
disperse
and
she
retired
to
her
bed
not
to
sleep
for
that
was
scarcely
possible
but
to
try
at
least
to
quiet
her
disturbed
fancy
and
to
collect
strength
of
spirits
sufficient
to
bear
her
through
the
scene
of
the
approaching
morning
dark
power
with
shuddâ€™ring
meek
submitted
thought
be
mine
to
read
the
visions
old
which
thy
awakâ€™ning
bards
have
told
and
lest
they
meet
my
blasted
view
hold
each
strange
tale
devoutly
true
collinsâ€™
ode
to
fear
emily
was
recalled
from
a
kind
of
slumber
into
which
she
had
at
length
sunk
by
a
quick
knocking
at
her
chamber
door
she
started
up
in
terror
for
montoni
and
count
morano
instantly
came
to
her
mind
but
having
listened
in
silence
for
some
time
and
recognising
the
voice
of
annette
she
rose
and
opened
the
door
â€œwhat
brings
you
hither
so
earlyâ€
said
emily
trembling
excessively
she
was
unable
to
support
herself
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
â€œdear
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œdo
not
look
so
pale
i
am
quite
frightened
to
see
you
here
is
a
fine
bustle
below
stairs
all
the
servants
running
to
and
fro
and
none
of
them
fast
enough
here
is
a
bustle
indeed
all
of
a
sudden
and
nobody
knows
for
whatâ€
â€œwho
is
below
besides
themâ€
said
emily
â€œannette
do
not
trifle
with
meâ€
â€œnot
for
the
world
maâ€™amselle
i
would
not
trifle
for
the
world
but
one
cannot
help
making
oneâ€™s
remarks
and
there
is
the
signor
in
such
a
bustle
as
i
never
saw
him
before
and
he
has
sent
me
to
tell
you
maâ€™am
to
get
ready
immediatelyâ€
â€œgood
god
support
meâ€
cried
emily
almost
fainting
â€œcount
morano
is
below
thenâ€
â€œno
maâ€™amselle
he
is
not
below
that
i
know
ofâ€
replied
annette
â€œonly
his
excellenza
sent
me
to
desire
you
would
get
ready
directly
to
leave
venice
for
that
the
gondolas
would
be
at
the
steps
of
the
canal
in
a
few
minutes
but
i
must
hurry
back
to
my
lady
who
is
just
at
her
witsâ€™
end
and
knows
not
which
way
to
turn
for
hasteâ€
â€œexplain
annette
explain
the
meaning
of
all
this
before
you
goâ€
said
emily
so
overcome
with
surprise
and
timid
hope
that
she
had
scarcely
breath
to
speak
â€œnay
maâ€™amselle
that
is
more
than
i
can
do
i
only
know
that
the
signor
is
just
come
home
in
a
very
ill
humour
that
he
has
had
us
all
called
out
of
our
beds
and
tells
us
we
are
all
to
leave
venice
immediatelyâ€
â€œis
count
morano
to
go
with
the
signorâ€
said
emily
â€œand
whither
are
we
goingâ€
â€œi
know
neither
maâ€™am
for
certain
but
i
heard
ludovico
say
something
about
going
after
we
get
to
terra-firma
to
the
signorâ€™s
castle
among
some
mountains
that
he
talked
ofâ€
â€œthe
apenninesâ€
said
emily
eagerly
â€œo
then
i
have
little
to
hopeâ€
â€œthat
is
the
very
place
maâ€™am
but
cheer
up
and
do
not
take
it
so
much
to
heart
and
think
what
a
little
time
you
have
to
get
ready
in
and
how
impatient
the
signor
is
holy
st
mark
i
hear
the
oars
on
the
canal
and
now
they
come
nearer
and
now
they
are
dashing
at
the
steps
below
it
is
the
gondola
sure
enoughâ€
annette
hastened
from
the
room
and
emily
prepared
for
this
unexpected
flight
as
fast
as
her
trembling
hands
would
permit
not
perceiving
that
any
change
in
her
situation
could
possibly
be
for
the
worse
she
had
scarcely
thrown
her
books
and
clothes
into
her
travelling
trunk
when
receiving
a
second
summons
she
went
down
to
her
auntâ€™s
dressing-room
where
she
found
montoni
impatiently
reproving
his
wife
for
delay
he
went
out
soon
after
to
give
some
further
orders
to
his
people
and
emily
then
enquired
the
occasion
of
this
hasty
journey
but
her
aunt
appeared
to
be
as
ignorant
as
herself
and
to
undertake
the
journey
with
more
reluctance
the
family
at
length
embarked
but
neither
count
morano
nor
cavigni
was
of
the
party
somewhat
revived
by
observing
this
emily
when
the
gondolieri
dashed
their
oars
in
the
water
and
put
off
from
the
steps
of
the
portico
felt
like
a
criminal
who
receives
a
short
reprieve
her
heart
beat
yet
lighter
when
they
emerged
from
the
canal
into
the
ocean
and
lighter
still
when
they
skimmed
past
the
walls
of
st
mark
without
having
stopped
to
take
up
count
morano
the
dawn
now
began
to
tint
the
horizon
and
to
break
upon
the
shores
of
the
adriatic
emily
did
not
venture
to
ask
any
questions
of
montoni
who
sat
for
some
time
in
gloomy
silence
and
then
rolled
himself
up
in
his
cloak
as
if
to
sleep
while
madame
montoni
did
the
same
but
emily
who
could
not
sleep
undrew
one
of
the
little
curtains
of
the
gondola
and
looked
out
upon
the
sea
the
rising
dawn
now
enlightened
the
mountain-tops
of
friuli
but
their
lower
sides
and
the
distant
waves
that
rolled
at
their
feet
were
still
in
deep
shadow
emily
sunk
in
tranquil
melancholy
watched
the
strengthening
light
spreading
upon
the
ocean
showing
successively
venice
and
her
islets
and
the
shores
of
italy
along
which
boats
with
their
pointed
latin
sails
began
to
move
the
gondolieri
were
frequently
hailed
at
this
early
hour
by
the
market-people
as
they
glided
by
towards
venice
and
the
lagune
soon
displayed
a
gay
scene
of
innumerable
little
barks
passing
from
terra-firma
with
provisions
emily
gave
a
last
look
to
that
splendid
city
but
her
mind
was
then
occupied
by
considering
the
probable
events
that
awaited
her
in
the
scenes
to
which
she
was
removing
and
with
conjectures
concerning
the
motive
of
this
sudden
journey
it
appeared
upon
calmer
consideration
that
montoni
was
removing
her
to
his
secluded
castle
because
he
could
there
with
more
probability
of
success
attempt
to
terrify
her
into
obedience
or
that
should
its
gloomy
and
sequestered
scenes
fail
of
this
effect
her
forced
marriage
with
the
count
could
there
be
solemnized
with
the
secrecy
which
was
necessary
to
the
honour
of
montoni
the
little
spirit
which
this
reprieve
had
recalled
now
began
to
fail
and
when
emily
reached
the
shore
her
mind
had
sunk
into
all
its
former
depression
montoni
did
not
embark
on
the
brenta
but
pursued
his
way
in
carriages
across
the
country
towards
the
apennine
during
which
journey
his
manner
to
emily
was
so
particularly
severe
that
this
alone
would
have
confirmed
her
late
conjecture
had
any
such
confirmation
been
necessary
her
senses
were
now
dead
to
the
beautiful
country
through
which
she
travelled
sometimes
she
was
compelled
to
smile
at
the
naã¯vetã©
of
annette
in
her
remarks
on
what
she
saw
and
sometimes
to
sigh
as
a
scene
of
peculiar
beauty
recalled
valancourt
to
her
thoughts
who
was
indeed
seldom
absent
from
them
and
of
whom
she
could
never
hope
to
hear
in
the
solitude
to
which
she
was
hastening
at
length
the
travellers
began
to
ascend
among
the
apennines
the
immense
pine-forests
which
at
that
period
overhung
these
mountains
and
between
which
the
road
wound
excluded
all
view
but
of
the
cliffs
aspiring
above
except
that
now
and
then
an
opening
through
the
dark
woods
allowed
the
eye
a
momentary
glimpse
of
the
country
below
the
gloom
of
these
shades
their
solitary
silence
except
when
the
breeze
swept
over
their
summits
the
tremendous
precipices
of
the
mountains
that
came
partially
to
the
eye
each
assisted
to
raise
the
solemnity
of
emilyâ€™s
feelings
into
awe
she
saw
only
images
of
gloomy
grandeur
or
of
dreadful
sublimity
around
her
other
images
equally
gloomy
and
equally
terrible
gleamed
on
her
imagination
she
was
going
she
scarcely
knew
whither
under
the
dominion
of
a
person
from
whose
arbitrary
disposition
she
had
already
suffered
so
much
to
marry
perhaps
a
man
who
possessed
neither
her
affection
nor
esteem
or
to
endure
beyond
the
hope
of
succour
whatever
punishment
revenge
and
that
italian
revenge
might
dictateâ€”the
more
she
considered
what
might
be
the
motive
of
the
journey
the
more
she
became
convinced
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
concluding
her
nuptials
with
count
morano
with
that
secrecy
which
her
resolute
resistance
had
made
necessary
to
the
honour
if
not
to
the
safety
of
montoni
from
the
deep
solitudes
into
which
she
was
emerging
and
from
the
gloomy
castle
of
which
she
had
heard
some
mysterious
hints
her
sick
heart
recoiled
in
despair
and
she
experienced
that
though
her
mind
was
already
occupied
by
peculiar
distress
it
was
still
alive
to
the
influence
of
new
and
local
circumstance
why
else
did
she
shudder
at
the
idea
of
this
desolate
castle
as
the
travellers
still
ascended
among
the
pine
forests
steep
rose
over
steep
the
mountains
seemed
to
multiply
as
they
went
and
what
was
the
summit
of
one
eminence
proved
to
be
only
the
base
of
another
at
length
they
reached
a
little
plain
where
the
drivers
stopped
to
rest
the
mules
whence
a
scene
of
such
extent
and
magnificence
opened
below
as
drew
even
from
madame
montoni
a
note
of
admiration
emily
lost
for
a
moment
her
sorrows
in
the
immensity
of
nature
beyond
the
amphitheatre
of
mountains
that
stretched
below
whose
tops
appeared
as
numerous
almost
as
the
waves
of
the
sea
and
whose
feet
were
concealed
by
the
forestsâ€”extended
the
campagna
of
italy
where
cities
and
rivers
and
woods
and
all
the
glow
of
cultivation
were
mingled
in
gay
confusion
the
adriatic
bounded
the
horizon
into
which
the
po
and
the
brenta
after
winding
through
the
whole
extent
of
the
landscape
poured
their
fruitful
waves
emily
gazed
long
on
the
splendours
of
the
world
she
was
quitting
of
which
the
whole
magnificence
seemed
thus
given
to
her
sight
only
to
increase
her
regret
on
leaving
it
for
her
valancourt
alone
was
in
that
world
to
him
alone
her
heart
turned
and
for
him
alone
fell
her
bitter
tears
from
this
sublime
scene
the
travellers
continued
to
ascend
among
the
pines
till
they
entered
a
narrow
pass
of
the
mountains
which
shut
out
every
feature
of
the
distant
country
and
in
its
stead
exhibited
only
tremendous
crags
impending
over
the
road
where
no
vestige
of
humanity
or
even
of
vegetation
appeared
except
here
and
there
the
trunk
and
scathed
branches
of
an
oak
that
hung
nearly
headlong
from
the
rock
into
which
its
strong
roots
had
fastened
this
pass
which
led
into
the
heart
of
the
apennine
at
length
opened
to
day
and
a
scene
of
mountains
stretched
in
long
perspective
as
wild
as
any
the
travellers
had
yet
passed
still
vast
pine-forests
hung
upon
their
base
and
crowned
the
ridgy
precipice
that
rose
perpendicularly
from
the
vale
while
above
the
rolling
mists
caught
the
sunbeams
and
touched
their
cliffs
with
all
the
magical
colouring
of
light
and
shade
the
scene
seemed
perpetually
changing
and
its
features
to
assume
new
forms
as
the
winding
road
brought
them
to
the
eye
in
different
attitudes
while
the
shifting
vapours
now
partially
concealing
their
minuter
beauties
and
now
illuminating
them
with
splendid
tints
assisted
the
illusions
of
the
sight
though
the
deep
valleys
between
these
mountains
were
for
the
most
part
clothed
with
pines
sometimes
an
abrupt
opening
presented
a
perspective
of
only
barren
rocks
with
a
cataract
flashing
from
their
summit
among
broken
cliffs
till
its
waters
reaching
the
bottom
foamed
along
with
unceasing
fury
and
sometimes
pastoral
scenes
exhibited
their
â€œgreen
delightsâ€
in
the
narrow
vales
smiling
amid
surrounding
horror
there
herds
and
flocks
of
goats
and
sheep
browsing
under
the
shade
of
hanging
woods
and
the
shepherdâ€™s
little
cabin
reared
on
the
margin
of
a
clear
stream
presented
a
sweet
picture
of
repose
wild
and
romantic
as
were
these
scenes
their
character
had
far
less
of
the
sublime
that
had
those
of
the
alps
which
guard
the
entrance
of
italy
emily
was
often
elevated
but
seldom
felt
those
emotions
of
indescribable
awe
which
she
had
so
continually
experienced
in
her
passage
over
the
alps
towards
the
close
of
day
the
road
wound
into
a
deep
valley
mountains
whose
shaggy
steeps
appeared
to
be
inaccessible
almost
surrounded
it
to
the
east
a
vista
opened
that
exhibited
the
apennines
in
their
darkest
horrors
and
the
long
perspective
of
retiring
summits
rising
over
each
other
their
ridges
clothed
with
pines
exhibited
a
stronger
image
of
grandeur
than
any
that
emily
had
yet
seen
the
sun
had
just
sunk
below
the
top
of
the
mountains
she
was
descending
whose
long
shadow
stretched
athwart
the
valley
but
his
sloping
rays
shooting
through
an
opening
of
the
cliffs
touched
with
a
yellow
gleam
the
summits
of
the
forest
that
hung
upon
the
opposite
steeps
and
streamed
in
full
splendour
upon
the
towers
and
battlements
of
a
castle
that
spread
its
extensive
ramparts
along
the
brow
of
a
precipice
above
the
splendour
of
these
illumined
objects
was
heightened
by
the
contrasted
shade
which
involved
the
valley
below
â€œthereâ€
said
montoni
speaking
for
the
first
time
in
several
hours
â€œis
udolphoâ€
emily
gazed
with
melancholy
awe
upon
the
castle
which
she
understood
to
be
montoniâ€™s
for
though
it
was
now
lighted
up
by
the
setting
sun
the
gothic
greatness
of
its
features
and
its
mouldering
walls
of
dark
grey
stone
rendered
it
a
gloomy
and
sublime
object
as
she
gazed
the
light
died
away
on
its
walls
leaving
a
melancholy
purple
tint
which
spread
deeper
and
deeper
as
the
thin
vapour
crept
up
the
mountain
while
the
battlements
above
were
still
tipped
with
splendour
from
those
too
the
rays
soon
faded
and
the
whole
edifice
was
invested
with
the
solemn
duskiness
of
evening
silent
lonely
and
sublime
it
seemed
to
stand
the
sovereign
of
the
scene
and
to
frown
defiance
on
all
who
dared
to
invade
its
solitary
reign
as
the
twilight
deepened
its
features
became
more
awful
in
obscurity
and
emily
continued
to
gaze
till
its
clustering
towers
were
alone
seen
rising
over
the
tops
of
the
woods
beneath
whose
thick
shade
the
carriages
soon
after
began
to
ascend
the
extent
and
darkness
of
these
tall
woods
awakened
terrific
images
in
her
mind
and
she
almost
expected
to
see
banditti
start
up
from
under
the
trees
at
length
the
carriages
emerged
upon
a
heathy
rock
and
soon
after
reached
the
castle
gates
where
the
deep
tone
of
the
portal
bell
which
was
struck
upon
to
give
notice
of
their
arrival
increased
the
fearful
emotions
that
had
assailed
emily
while
they
waited
till
the
servant
within
should
come
to
open
the
gates
she
anxiously
surveyed
the
edifice
but
the
gloom
that
overspread
it
allowed
her
to
distinguish
little
more
than
a
part
of
its
outline
with
the
massy
walls
of
the
ramparts
and
to
know
that
it
was
vast
ancient
and
dreary
from
the
parts
she
saw
she
judged
of
the
heavy
strength
and
extent
of
the
whole
the
gateway
before
her
leading
into
the
courts
was
of
gigantic
size
and
was
defended
by
two
round
towers
crowned
by
overhanging
turrets
embattled
where
instead
of
banners
now
waved
long
grass
and
wild
plants
that
had
taken
root
among
the
mouldering
stones
and
which
seemed
to
sigh
as
the
breeze
rolled
past
over
the
desolation
around
them
the
towers
were
united
by
a
curtain
pierced
and
embattled
also
below
which
appeared
the
pointed
arch
of
a
huge
portcullis
surmounting
the
gates
from
these
the
walls
of
the
ramparts
extended
to
other
towers
overlooking
the
precipice
whose
shattered
outline
appearing
on
a
gleam
that
lingered
in
the
west
told
of
the
ravages
of
warâ€”beyond
these
all
was
lost
in
the
obscurity
of
evening
while
emily
gazed
with
awe
upon
the
scene
footsteps
were
heard
within
the
gates
and
the
undrawing
of
bolts
after
which
an
ancient
servant
of
the
castle
appeared
forcing
back
the
huge
folds
of
the
portal
to
admit
his
lord
as
the
carriage-wheels
rolled
heavily
under
the
portcullis
emilyâ€™s
heart
sunk
and
she
seemed
as
if
she
was
going
into
her
prison
the
gloomy
court
into
which
she
passed
served
to
confirm
the
idea
and
her
imagination
ever
awake
to
circumstance
suggested
even
more
terrors
than
her
reason
could
justify
another
gate
delivered
them
into
the
second
court
grass-grown
and
more
wild
than
the
first
where
as
she
surveyed
through
the
twilight
its
desolationâ€”its
lofty
walls
overtopped
with
briony
moss
and
nightshade
and
the
embattled
towers
that
rose
aboveâ€”long-suffering
and
murder
came
to
her
thoughts
one
of
those
instantaneous
and
unaccountable
convictions
which
sometimes
conquer
even
strong
minds
impressed
her
with
its
horror
the
sentiment
was
not
diminished
when
she
entered
an
extensive
gothic
hall
obscured
by
the
gloom
of
evening
which
a
light
glimmering
at
a
distance
through
a
long
perspective
of
arches
only
rendered
more
striking
as
a
servant
brought
the
lamp
nearer
partial
gleams
fell
upon
the
pillars
and
the
pointed
arches
forming
a
strong
contrast
with
their
shadows
that
stretched
along
the
pavement
and
the
walls
the
sudden
journey
of
montoni
had
prevented
his
people
from
making
any
other
preparations
for
his
reception
than
could
be
had
in
the
short
interval
since
the
arrival
of
the
servant
who
had
been
sent
forward
from
venice
and
this
in
some
measure
may
account
for
the
air
of
extreme
desolation
that
everywhere
appeared
the
servant
who
came
to
light
montoni
bowed
in
silence
and
the
muscles
of
his
countenance
relaxed
with
no
symptom
of
joyâ€”montoni
noticed
the
salutation
by
a
slight
motion
of
his
hand
and
passed
on
while
his
lady
following
and
looking
round
with
a
degree
of
surprise
and
discontent
which
she
seemed
fearful
of
expressing
and
emily
surveying
the
extent
and
grandeur
of
the
hall
in
timid
wonder
approached
a
marble
staircase
the
arches
here
opened
to
a
lofty
vault
from
the
centre
of
which
hung
a
tripod
lamp
which
a
servant
was
hastily
lighting
and
the
rich
fret-work
of
the
roof
a
corridor
leading
into
several
upper
apartments
and
a
painted
window
stretching
nearly
from
the
pavement
to
the
ceiling
of
the
hall
became
gradually
visible
having
crossed
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
passed
through
an
ante-room
they
entered
a
spacious
apartment
whose
walls
wainscoted
with
black
larch-wood
the
growth
of
the
neighbouring
mountains
were
scarcely
distinguishable
from
darkness
itself
â€œbring
more
lightâ€
said
montoni
as
he
entered
the
servant
setting
down
his
lamp
was
withdrawing
to
obey
him
when
madame
montoni
observing
that
the
evening
air
of
this
mountainous
region
was
cold
and
that
she
should
like
a
fire
montoni
ordered
that
wood
might
be
brought
while
he
paced
the
room
with
thoughtful
steps
and
madame
montoni
sat
silently
on
a
couch
at
the
upper
end
of
it
waiting
till
the
servant
returned
emily
was
observing
the
singular
solemnity
and
desolation
of
the
apartment
viewed
as
it
now
was
by
the
glimmer
of
the
single
lamp
placed
near
a
large
venetian
mirror
that
duskily
reflected
the
scene
with
the
tall
figure
of
montoni
passing
slowly
along
his
arms
folded
and
his
countenance
shaded
by
the
plume
that
waved
in
his
hat
from
the
contemplation
of
this
scene
emilyâ€™s
mind
proceeded
to
the
apprehension
of
what
she
might
suffer
in
it
till
the
remembrance
of
valancourt
far
far
distant
came
to
her
heart
and
softened
it
into
sorrow
a
heavy
sigh
escaped
her
but
trying
to
conceal
her
tears
she
walked
away
to
one
of
the
high
windows
that
opened
upon
the
ramparts
below
which
spread
the
woods
she
had
passed
in
her
approach
to
the
castle
but
the
night-shade
sat
deeply
on
the
mountains
beyond
and
their
indented
outline
alone
could
be
faintly
traced
on
the
horizon
where
a
red
streak
yet
glimmered
in
the
west
the
valley
between
was
sunk
in
darkness
the
scene
within
upon
which
emily
turned
on
the
opening
of
the
door
was
scarcely
less
gloomy
the
old
servant
who
had
received
them
at
the
gates
now
entered
bending
under
a
load
of
pine-branches
while
two
of
montoniâ€™s
venetian
servants
followed
with
lights
â€œyour
excellenza
is
welcome
to
the
castleâ€
said
the
old
man
as
he
raised
himself
from
the
hearth
where
he
had
laid
the
wood
â€œit
has
been
a
lonely
place
a
long
while
but
you
will
excuse
it
signor
knowing
we
had
but
short
notice
it
is
near
two
years
come
next
feast
of
st
mark
since
your
excellenza
was
within
these
wallsâ€
â€œyou
have
a
good
memory
old
carloâ€
said
montoni
â€œit
is
thereabout
and
how
hast
thou
contrived
to
live
so
longâ€
â€œa-well-a-day
sir
with
much
ado
the
cold
winds
that
blow
through
the
castle
in
winter
are
almost
too
much
for
me
and
i
thought
sometimes
of
asking
your
excellenza
to
let
me
leave
the
mountains
and
go
down
into
the
lowlands
but
i
donâ€™t
know
how
it
isâ€”i
am
loth
to
quit
these
old
walls
i
have
lived
in
so
longâ€
â€œwell
how
have
you
gone
on
in
the
castle
since
i
left
itâ€
said
montoni
â€œwhy
much
as
usual
signor
only
it
wants
a
good
deal
of
repairing
there
is
the
north
towerâ€”some
of
the
battlements
have
tumbled
down
and
had
liked
one
day
to
have
knocked
my
poor
wife
god
rest
her
soul
on
the
head
your
excellenza
must
knowâ€”â€
â€œwell
but
the
repairsâ€
interrupted
montoni
â€œaye
the
repairsâ€
said
carlo
â€œa
part
of
the
roof
of
the
great
hall
has
fallen
in
and
all
the
winds
from
the
mountains
rushed
through
it
last
winter
and
whistled
through
the
whole
castle
so
that
there
was
no
keeping
oneâ€™s
self
warm
be
where
one
would
there
my
wife
and
i
used
to
sit
shivering
over
a
great
fire
in
one
corner
of
the
little
hall
ready
to
die
with
cold
andâ€”â€
â€œbut
there
are
no
more
repairs
wantedâ€
said
montoni
impatiently
â€œo
lord
your
excellenza
yesâ€”the
wall
of
the
rampart
has
tumbled
down
in
three
places
then
the
stairs
that
lead
to
the
west
gallery
have
been
a
long
time
so
bad
that
it
is
dangerous
to
go
up
them
and
the
passage
leading
to
the
great
oak
chamber
that
overhangs
the
north
rampartâ€”one
night
last
winter
i
ventured
to
go
there
by
myself
and
your
excellenzaâ€”â€
â€œwell
well
enough
of
thisâ€
said
montoni
with
quickness
â€œi
will
talk
more
with
thee
tomorrowâ€
the
fire
was
now
lighted
carlo
swept
the
hearth
placed
chairs
wiped
the
dust
from
a
large
marble
table
that
stood
near
it
and
then
left
the
room
montoni
and
his
family
drew
round
the
fire
madame
montoni
made
several
attempts
at
conversation
but
his
sullen
answers
repulsed
her
while
emily
sat
endeavouring
to
acquire
courage
enough
to
speak
to
him
at
length
in
a
tremulous
voice
she
said
â€œmay
i
ask
sir
the
motive
of
this
sudden
journeyâ€â€”after
a
long
pause
she
recovered
sufficient
courage
to
repeat
the
question
â€œit
does
not
suit
me
to
answer
enquiriesâ€
said
montoni
â€œnor
does
it
become
you
to
make
them
time
may
unfold
them
all
but
i
desire
i
may
be
no
further
harassed
and
i
recommend
it
to
you
to
retire
to
your
chamber
and
to
endeavour
to
adopt
a
more
rational
conduct
than
that
of
yielding
to
fancies
and
to
a
sensibility
which
to
call
it
by
the
gentlest
name
is
only
a
weaknessâ€
emily
rose
to
withdraw
â€œgood
night
madamâ€
said
she
to
her
aunt
with
an
assumed
composure
that
could
not
disguise
her
emotion
â€œgood
night
my
dearâ€
said
madame
montoni
in
a
tone
of
kindness
which
her
niece
had
never
before
heard
from
her
and
the
unexpected
endearment
brought
tears
to
emilyâ€™s
eyes
she
curtsied
to
montoni
and
was
retiring
â€œbut
you
do
not
know
the
way
to
your
chamberâ€
said
her
aunt
montoni
called
the
servant
who
waited
in
the
ante-room
and
bade
him
send
madame
montoniâ€™s
woman
with
whom
in
a
few
minutes
emily
withdrew
â€œdo
you
know
which
is
my
roomâ€
said
she
to
annette
as
they
crossed
the
hall
â€œyes
i
believe
i
do
maâ€™amselle
but
this
is
such
a
strange
rambling
place
i
have
been
lost
in
it
already
they
call
it
the
double
chamber
over
the
south
rampart
and
i
went
up
this
great
staircase
to
it
my
ladyâ€™s
room
is
at
the
other
end
of
the
castleâ€
emily
ascended
the
marble
staircase
and
came
to
the
corridor
as
they
passed
through
which
annette
resumed
her
chatâ€”â€œwhat
a
wild
lonely
place
this
is
maâ€™am
i
shall
be
quite
frightened
to
live
in
it
how
often
and
often
have
i
wished
myself
in
france
again
i
little
thought
when
i
came
with
my
lady
to
see
the
world
that
i
should
ever
be
shut
up
in
such
a
place
as
this
or
i
would
never
have
left
my
own
country
this
way
maâ€™amselle
down
this
turning
i
can
almost
believe
in
giants
again
and
such
like
for
this
is
just
like
one
of
their
castles
and
some
night
or
other
i
suppose
i
shall
see
fairies
too
hopping
about
in
that
great
old
hall
that
looks
more
like
a
church
with
its
huge
pillars
than
anything
elseâ€
â€œyesâ€
said
emily
smiling
and
glad
to
escape
from
more
serious
thought
â€œif
we
come
to
the
corridor
about
midnight
and
look
down
into
the
hall
we
shall
certainly
see
it
illuminated
with
a
thousand
lamps
and
the
fairies
tripping
in
gay
circles
to
the
sound
of
delicious
music
for
it
is
in
such
places
as
this
you
know
that
they
come
to
hold
their
revels
but
i
am
afraid
annette
you
will
not
be
able
to
pay
the
necessary
penance
for
such
a
sight
and
if
once
they
hear
your
voice
the
whole
scene
will
vanish
in
an
instantâ€
â€œo
if
you
will
bear
me
company
maâ€™amselle
i
will
come
to
the
corridor
this
very
night
and
i
promise
you
i
will
hold
my
tongue
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
if
the
show
vanishesâ€”but
do
you
think
they
will
comeâ€
â€œi
cannot
promise
that
with
certainty
but
i
will
venture
to
say
it
will
not
be
your
fault
if
the
enchantment
should
vanishâ€
â€œwell
maâ€™amselle
that
is
saying
more
than
i
expected
of
you
but
i
am
not
so
much
afraid
of
fairies
as
of
ghosts
and
they
say
there
are
a
plentiful
many
of
them
about
the
castle
now
i
should
be
frightened
to
death
if
i
should
chance
to
see
any
of
them
but
hush
maâ€™amselle
walk
softly
i
have
thought
several
times
something
passed
by
meâ€
â€œridiculousâ€
said
emily
â€œyou
must
not
indulge
such
fanciesâ€
â€œo
maâ€™am
they
are
not
fancies
for
aught
i
know
benedetto
says
these
dismal
galleries
and
halls
are
fit
for
nothing
but
ghosts
to
live
in
and
i
verily
believe
if
i
live
long
in
them
i
shall
turn
to
one
myselfâ€
â€œi
hopeâ€
said
emily
â€œyou
will
not
suffer
signor
montoni
to
hear
of
these
weak
fears
they
would
highly
displease
himâ€
â€œwhat
you
know
then
maâ€™amselle
all
about
itâ€
rejoined
annette
â€œno
no
i
do
know
better
than
to
do
so
though
if
the
signor
can
sleep
sound
nobody
else
in
the
castle
has
any
right
to
lie
awake
i
am
sureâ€
emily
did
not
appear
to
notice
this
remark
â€œdown
this
passage
maâ€™amselle
this
leads
to
a
back
staircase
o
if
i
see
anything
i
shall
be
frightened
out
of
my
witsâ€
â€œthat
will
scarcely
be
possibleâ€
said
emily
smiling
as
she
followed
the
winding
of
the
passage
which
opened
into
another
gallery
and
then
annette
perceiving
that
she
had
missed
her
way
while
she
had
been
so
eloquently
haranguing
on
ghosts
and
fairies
wandered
about
through
other
passages
and
galleries
till
at
length
frightened
by
their
intricacies
and
desolation
she
called
aloud
for
assistance
but
they
were
beyond
the
hearing
of
the
servants
who
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
castle
and
emily
now
opened
the
door
of
a
chamber
on
the
left
â€œo
do
not
go
in
there
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œyou
will
only
lose
yourself
furtherâ€
â€œbring
the
light
forwardâ€
said
emily
â€œwe
may
possibly
find
our
way
through
these
roomsâ€
annette
stood
at
the
door
in
an
attitude
of
hesitation
with
the
light
held
up
to
show
the
chamber
but
the
feeble
rays
spread
through
not
half
of
it
â€œwhy
do
you
hesitateâ€
said
emily
â€œlet
me
see
whither
this
room
leadsâ€
annette
advanced
reluctantly
it
opened
into
a
suite
of
spacious
and
ancient
apartments
some
of
which
were
hung
with
tapestry
and
others
wainscoted
with
cedar
and
black
larch-wood
what
furniture
there
was
seemed
to
be
almost
as
old
as
the
rooms
and
retained
an
appearance
of
grandeur
though
covered
with
dust
and
dropping
to
pieces
with
the
damps
and
with
age
â€œhow
cold
these
rooms
are
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œnobody
has
lived
in
them
for
many
many
years
they
say
do
let
us
goâ€
â€œthey
may
open
upon
the
great
staircase
perhapsâ€
said
emily
passing
on
till
she
came
to
a
chamber
hung
with
pictures
and
took
the
light
to
examine
that
of
a
soldier
on
horseback
in
a
field
of
battleâ€”he
was
darting
his
spear
upon
a
man
who
lay
under
the
feet
of
the
horse
and
who
held
up
one
hand
in
a
supplicating
attitude
the
soldier
whose
beaver
was
up
regarded
him
with
a
look
of
vengeance
and
the
countenance
with
that
expression
struck
emily
as
resembling
montoni
she
shuddered
and
turned
from
it
passing
the
light
hastily
over
several
other
pictures
she
came
to
one
concealed
by
a
veil
of
black
silk
the
singularity
of
the
circumstance
struck
her
and
she
stopped
before
it
wishing
to
remove
the
veil
and
examine
what
could
thus
carefully
be
concealed
but
somewhat
wanting
courage
â€œholy
virgin
what
can
this
meanâ€
exclaimed
annette
â€œthis
is
surely
the
picture
they
told
me
of
at
veniceâ€
â€œwhat
pictureâ€
said
emily
â€œwhy
a
pictureâ€”a
pictureâ€
replied
annette
hesitatinglyâ€”â€œbut
i
never
could
make
out
exactly
what
it
was
about
eitherâ€
â€œremove
the
veil
annetteâ€
â€œwhat
i
maâ€™amselleâ€”i
not
for
the
worldâ€
emily
turning
round
saw
annetteâ€™s
countenance
grow
pale
â€œand
pray
what
have
you
heard
of
this
picture
to
terrify
you
so
my
good
girlâ€
said
she
â€œnothing
maâ€™amselle
i
have
heard
nothing
only
let
us
find
our
way
outâ€
â€œcertainly
but
i
wish
first
to
examine
the
picture
take
the
light
annette
while
i
lift
the
veilâ€
annette
took
the
light
and
immediately
walked
away
with
it
disregarding
emilyâ€™s
call
to
stay
who
not
choosing
to
be
left
alone
in
the
dark
chamber
at
length
followed
her
â€œwhat
is
the
reason
of
this
annetteâ€
said
emily
when
she
overtook
her
â€œwhat
have
you
heard
concerning
that
picture
which
makes
you
so
unwilling
to
stay
when
i
bid
youâ€
â€œi
donâ€™t
know
what
is
the
reason
maâ€™amselleâ€
replied
annette
â€œnor
anything
about
the
picture
only
i
have
heard
there
is
something
very
dreadful
belonging
to
itâ€”and
that
it
has
been
covered
up
in
black
ever
sinceâ€”and
that
nobody
has
looked
at
it
for
a
great
many
yearsâ€”and
it
somehow
has
to
do
with
the
owner
of
this
castle
before
signor
montoni
came
to
the
possession
of
itâ€”andâ€”â€
â€œwell
annetteâ€
said
emily
smiling
â€œi
perceive
it
is
as
you
sayâ€”that
you
know
nothing
about
the
pictureâ€
â€œno
nothing
indeed
maâ€™amselle
for
they
made
me
promise
never
to
tellâ€”butâ€”â€
â€œwellâ€
rejoined
emily
who
observed
that
she
was
struggling
between
her
inclination
to
reveal
a
secret
and
her
apprehension
for
the
consequence
â€œi
will
enquire
no
furtherâ€”â€
â€œno
pray
maâ€™am
do
notâ€
â€œlest
you
should
tell
allâ€
interrupted
emily
annette
blushed
and
emily
smiled
and
they
passed
on
to
the
extremity
of
this
suite
of
apartments
and
found
themselves
after
some
further
perplexity
once
more
at
the
top
of
the
marble
staircase
where
annette
left
emily
while
she
went
to
call
one
of
the
servants
of
the
castle
to
show
them
to
the
chamber
for
which
they
had
been
seeking
while
she
was
absent
emilyâ€™s
thoughts
returned
to
the
picture
an
unwillingness
to
tamper
with
the
integrity
of
a
servant
had
checked
her
enquiries
on
this
subject
as
well
as
concerning
some
alarming
hints
which
annette
had
dropped
respecting
montoni
though
her
curiosity
was
entirely
awakened
and
she
had
perceived
that
her
questions
might
easily
be
answered
she
was
now
however
inclined
to
go
back
to
the
apartment
and
examine
the
picture
but
the
loneliness
of
the
hour
and
of
the
place
with
the
melancholy
silence
that
reigned
around
her
conspired
with
a
certain
degree
of
awe
excited
by
the
mystery
attending
this
picture
to
prevent
her
she
determined
however
when
daylight
should
have
reanimated
her
spirits
to
go
thither
and
remove
the
veil
as
she
leaned
from
the
corridor
over
the
staircase
and
her
eyes
wandered
round
she
again
observed
with
wonder
the
vast
strength
of
the
walls
now
somewhat
decayed
and
the
pillars
of
solid
marble
that
rose
from
the
hall
and
supported
the
roof
a
servant
now
appeared
with
annette
and
conducted
emily
to
her
chamber
which
was
in
a
remote
part
of
the
castle
and
at
the
very
end
of
the
corridor
from
whence
the
suite
of
apartments
opened
through
which
they
had
been
wandering
the
lonely
aspect
of
her
room
made
emily
unwilling
that
annette
should
leave
her
immediately
and
the
dampness
of
it
chilled
her
with
more
than
fear
she
begged
caterina
the
servant
of
the
castle
to
bring
some
wood
and
light
a
fire
â€œaye
lady
itâ€™s
many
a
year
since
a
fire
was
lighted
hereâ€
said
caterina
â€œyou
need
not
tell
us
that
good
womanâ€
said
annette
â€œevery
room
in
the
castle
feels
like
a
well
i
wonder
how
you
contrive
to
live
here
for
my
part
i
wish
myself
at
venice
againâ€
emily
waved
her
hand
for
caterina
to
fetch
the
wood
â€œi
wonder
maâ€™am
why
they
call
this
the
double
chamberâ€
said
annette
while
emily
surveyed
it
in
silence
and
saw
that
it
was
lofty
and
spacious
like
the
others
she
had
seen
and
like
many
of
them
too
had
its
walls
lined
with
dark
larch-wood
the
bed
and
other
furniture
was
very
ancient
and
had
an
air
of
gloomy
grandeur
like
all
that
she
had
seen
in
the
castle
one
of
the
high
casements
which
she
opened
overlooked
a
rampart
but
the
view
beyond
was
hid
in
darkness
in
the
presence
of
annette
emily
tried
to
support
her
spirits
and
to
restrain
the
tears
which
every
now
and
then
came
to
her
eyes
she
wished
much
to
enquire
when
count
morano
was
expected
at
the
castle
but
an
unwillingness
to
ask
unnecessary
questions
and
to
mention
family
concerns
to
a
servant
withheld
her
meanwhile
annetteâ€™s
thoughts
were
engaged
upon
another
subject
she
dearly
loved
the
marvellous
and
had
heard
of
a
circumstance
connected
with
the
castle
that
highly
gratified
this
taste
having
been
enjoined
not
to
mention
it
her
inclination
to
tell
it
was
so
strong
that
she
was
every
instant
on
the
point
of
speaking
what
she
had
heard
such
a
strange
circumstance
too
and
to
be
obliged
to
conceal
it
was
a
severe
punishment
but
she
knew
that
montoni
might
impose
one
much
severer
and
she
feared
to
incur
it
by
offending
him
caterina
now
brought
the
wood
and
its
bright
blaze
dispelled
for
a
while
the
gloom
of
the
chamber
she
told
annette
that
her
lady
had
enquired
for
her
and
emily
was
once
again
left
to
her
own
sad
reflections
her
heart
was
not
yet
hardened
against
the
stern
manners
of
montoni
and
she
was
nearly
as
much
shocked
now
as
she
had
been
when
she
first
witnessed
them
the
tenderness
and
affection
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
till
she
lost
her
parents
had
made
her
particularly
sensible
to
any
degree
of
unkindness
and
such
a
reverse
as
this
no
apprehension
had
prepared
her
to
support
to
call
off
her
attention
from
subjects
that
pressed
heavily
on
her
spirits
she
rose
and
again
examined
her
room
and
its
furniture
as
she
walked
round
it
she
passed
a
door
that
was
not
quite
shut
and
perceiving
that
it
was
not
the
one
through
which
she
entered
she
brought
the
light
forward
to
discover
whither
it
led
she
opened
it
and
going
forward
had
nearly
fallen
down
a
steep
narrow
staircase
that
wound
from
it
between
two
stone
walls
she
wished
to
know
to
what
it
led
and
was
the
more
anxious
since
it
communicated
so
immediately
with
her
apartment
but
in
the
present
state
of
her
spirits
she
wanted
courage
to
venture
into
the
darkness
alone
closing
the
door
therefore
she
endeavoured
to
fasten
it
but
upon
further
examination
perceived
that
it
had
no
bolts
on
the
chamber
side
though
it
had
two
on
the
other
by
placing
a
heavy
chair
against
it
she
in
some
measure
remedied
the
defect
yet
she
was
still
alarmed
at
the
thought
of
sleeping
in
this
remote
room
alone
with
a
door
opening
she
knew
not
whither
and
which
could
not
be
perfectly
fastened
on
the
inside
sometimes
she
wished
to
entreat
of
madame
montoni
that
annette
might
have
leave
to
remain
with
her
all
night
but
was
deterred
by
an
apprehension
of
betraying
what
would
be
thought
childish
fears
and
by
an
unwillingness
to
increase
the
apt
terrors
of
annette
her
gloomy
reflections
were
soon
after
interrupted
by
a
footstep
in
the
corridor
and
she
was
glad
to
see
annette
enter
with
some
supper
sent
by
madame
montoni
having
a
table
near
the
fire
she
made
the
good
girl
sit
down
and
sup
with
her
and
when
their
little
repast
was
over
annette
encouraged
by
her
kindness
and
stirring
the
wood
into
a
blaze
drew
her
chair
upon
the
hearth
nearer
to
emily
and
saidâ€”â€œdid
you
ever
hear
maâ€™amselle
of
the
strange
accident
that
made
the
signor
lord
of
this
castleâ€
â€œwhat
wonderful
story
have
you
now
to
tellâ€
said
emily
concealing
the
curiosity
occasioned
by
the
mysterious
hints
she
had
formerly
heard
on
that
subject
â€œi
have
heard
all
about
it
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
looking
round
the
chamber
and
drawing
closer
to
emily
â€œbenedetto
told
it
me
as
we
travelled
together
says
he
â€˜annette
you
donâ€™t
know
about
this
castle
here
that
we
are
going
toâ€™
â€˜noâ€™
says
i
â€˜mr
benedetto
pray
what
do
you
knowâ€™
but
maâ€™amselle
you
can
keep
a
secret
or
i
would
not
tell
it
you
for
the
world
for
i
promised
never
to
tell
and
they
say
that
the
signor
does
not
like
to
have
it
talked
ofâ€
â€œif
you
promised
to
keep
this
secretâ€
said
emily
â€œyou
do
right
not
to
mention
itâ€
annette
paused
a
moment
and
then
said
â€œo
but
to
you
maâ€™amselle
to
you
i
may
tell
it
safely
i
knowâ€
emily
smiled
â€œi
certainly
shall
keep
it
as
faithful
as
yourself
annetteâ€
annette
replied
very
gravely
that
would
do
and
proceededâ€”â€œthis
castle
you
must
know
maâ€™amselle
is
very
old
and
very
strong
and
has
stood
out
many
sieges
as
they
say
now
it
was
not
signor
montoniâ€™s
always
nor
his
fatherâ€™s
no
but
by
some
law
or
other
it
was
to
come
to
the
signor
if
the
lady
died
unmarriedâ€
â€œwhat
ladyâ€
said
emily
â€œi
am
not
come
to
that
yetâ€
replied
annette
â€œit
is
the
lady
i
am
going
to
tell
you
about
maâ€™amselle
but
as
i
was
saying
this
lady
lived
in
the
castle
and
had
everything
very
grand
about
her
as
you
may
suppose
maâ€™amselle
the
signor
used
often
to
come
to
see
her
and
was
in
love
with
her
and
offered
to
marry
her
for
though
he
was
somehow
related
that
did
not
signify
but
she
was
in
love
with
somebody
else
and
would
not
have
him
which
made
him
very
angry
as
they
say
and
you
know
maâ€™amselle
what
an
ill-looking
gentleman
he
is
when
he
is
angry
perhaps
she
saw
him
in
a
passion
and
therefore
would
not
have
him
but
as
i
was
saying
she
was
very
melancholy
and
unhappy
and
all
that
for
a
long
while
andâ€”holy
virgin
what
noise
is
that
did
not
you
hear
a
sound
maâ€™amselleâ€
â€œit
was
only
the
windâ€
said
emily
â€œbut
do
come
to
the
end
of
your
storyâ€
â€œas
i
was
sayingâ€”o
where
was
iâ€”as
i
was
sayingâ€”she
was
very
melancholy
and
unhappy
a
long
while
and
used
to
walk
about
upon
the
terrace
there
under
the
windows
by
herself
and
cry
so
it
would
have
done
your
heart
good
to
hear
her
that
isâ€”i
donâ€™t
mean
good
but
it
would
have
made
you
cry
too
as
they
tell
meâ€
â€œwell
but
annette
do
tell
me
the
substance
of
your
taleâ€
â€œall
in
good
time
maâ€™am
all
this
i
heard
before
at
venice
but
what
is
to
come
i
never
heard
till
today
this
happened
a
great
many
years
ago
when
signor
montoni
was
quite
a
young
man
the
ladyâ€”they
called
her
signora
laurentini
was
very
handsome
but
she
used
to
be
in
great
passions
too
sometimes
as
well
as
the
signor
finding
he
could
not
make
her
listen
to
himâ€”what
does
he
do
but
leave
the
castle
and
never
comes
near
it
for
a
long
time
but
it
was
all
one
to
her
she
was
just
as
unhappy
whether
he
was
here
or
not
till
one
evening
holy
st
peter
maâ€™amselleâ€
cried
annette
â€œlook
at
that
lamp
see
how
blue
it
burnsâ€
she
looked
fearfully
round
the
chamber
â€œridiculous
girlâ€
said
emily
â€œwhy
will
you
indulge
those
fancies
pray
let
me
hear
the
end
of
your
story
i
am
wearyâ€
annette
still
kept
her
eyes
on
the
lamp
and
proceeded
in
a
lower
voice
â€œit
was
one
evening
they
say
at
the
latter
end
of
the
year
it
might
be
about
the
middle
of
september
i
suppose
or
the
beginning
of
october
nay
for
that
matter
it
might
be
november
for
that
too
is
the
latter
end
of
the
year
but
that
i
cannot
say
for
certain
because
they
did
not
tell
me
for
certain
themselves
however
it
was
at
the
latter
end
of
the
year
this
grand
lady
walked
out
of
the
castle
into
the
woods
below
as
she
had
often
done
before
all
alone
only
her
maid
was
with
her
the
wind
blew
cold
and
strewed
the
leaves
about
and
whistled
dismally
among
those
great
old
chesnut
trees
that
we
passed
maâ€™amselle
as
we
came
to
the
castleâ€”for
benedetto
showed
me
the
trees
as
he
was
talkingâ€”the
wind
blew
cold
and
her
woman
would
have
persuaded
her
to
return
but
all
would
not
do
for
she
was
fond
of
walking
in
the
woods
at
evening
time
and
if
the
leaves
were
falling
about
her
so
much
the
better
â€œwell
they
saw
her
go
down
among
the
woods
but
night
came
and
she
did
not
return
ten
oâ€™clock
eleven
oâ€™clock
twelve
oâ€™clock
came
and
no
lady
well
the
servants
thought
to
be
sure
some
accident
had
befallen
her
and
they
went
out
to
seek
her
they
searched
all
night
long
but
could
not
find
her
or
any
trace
of
her
and
from
that
day
to
this
maâ€™amselle
she
has
never
been
heard
ofâ€
â€œis
this
true
annetteâ€
said
emily
in
much
surprise
â€œtrue
maâ€™amâ€
said
annette
with
a
look
of
horror
â€œyes
it
is
true
indeed
but
they
do
sayâ€
she
added
lowering
her
voice
â€œthey
do
say
that
the
signora
has
been
seen
several
times
since
walking
in
the
woods
and
about
the
castle
in
the
night
several
of
the
old
servants
who
remained
here
some
time
after
declare
they
saw
her
and
since
then
she
has
been
seen
by
some
of
the
vassals
who
have
happened
to
be
in
the
castle
at
night
carlo
the
old
steward
could
tell
such
things
they
say
if
he
wouldâ€
â€œhow
contradictory
is
this
annetteâ€
said
emily
â€œyou
say
nothing
has
been
since
known
of
her
and
yet
she
has
been
seenâ€
â€œbut
all
this
was
told
me
for
a
great
secretâ€
rejoined
annette
without
noticing
the
remark
â€œand
i
am
sure
maâ€™am
you
would
not
hurt
either
me
or
benedetto
so
much
as
to
go
and
tell
it
againâ€
emily
remained
silent
and
annette
repeated
her
last
sentence
â€œyou
have
nothing
to
fear
from
my
indiscretionâ€
replied
emily
â€œand
let
me
advise
you
my
good
annette
be
discreet
yourself
and
never
mention
what
you
have
just
told
me
to
any
other
person
signor
montoni
as
you
say
may
be
angry
if
he
hears
of
it
but
what
inquiries
were
made
concerning
the
ladyâ€
â€œo
a
great
deal
indeed
maâ€™amselle
for
the
signor
laid
claim
to
the
castle
directly
as
being
the
next
heir
and
they
said
that
is
the
judges
or
the
senators
or
somebody
of
that
sort
said
he
could
not
take
possession
of
it
till
so
many
years
were
gone
by
and
then
if
after
all
the
lady
could
not
be
found
why
she
would
be
as
good
as
dead
and
the
castle
would
be
his
own
and
so
it
is
his
own
but
the
story
went
round
and
many
strange
reports
were
spread
so
very
strange
maâ€™amselle
that
i
shall
not
tell
themâ€
â€œthat
is
stranger
still
annetteâ€
said
emily
smiling
and
rousing
herself
from
her
reverie
â€œbut
when
signora
laurentini
was
afterwards
seen
in
the
castle
did
nobody
speak
to
herâ€
â€œspeakâ€”speak
to
herâ€
cried
annette
with
a
look
of
terror
â€œno
to
be
sureâ€
â€œand
why
notâ€
rejoined
emily
willing
to
hear
further
â€œholy
mother
speak
to
a
spiritâ€
â€œbut
what
reason
had
they
to
conclude
it
was
a
spirit
unless
they
had
approached
and
spoken
to
itâ€
â€œo
maâ€™amselle
i
cannot
tell
how
can
you
ask
such
shocking
questions
but
nobody
ever
saw
it
come
in
or
go
out
of
the
castle
and
it
was
in
one
place
now
and
then
the
next
minute
in
quite
another
part
of
the
castle
and
then
it
never
spoke
and
if
it
was
alive
what
should
it
do
in
the
castle
if
it
never
spoke
several
parts
of
the
castle
have
never
been
gone
into
since
they
say
for
that
very
reasonâ€
â€œwhat
because
it
never
spokeâ€
said
emily
trying
to
laugh
away
the
fears
that
began
to
steal
upon
her
â€œno
maâ€™amselle
noâ€
replied
annette
rather
angrily
â€œbut
because
something
has
been
seen
there
they
say
too
there
is
an
old
chapel
adjoining
the
west
side
of
the
castle
where
any
time
at
midnight
you
may
hear
such
groansâ€”it
makes
one
shudder
to
think
of
themâ€”and
strange
sights
have
been
seen
thereâ€”â€
â€œprâ€™ythee
annette
no
more
of
these
silly
talesâ€
said
emily
â€œsilly
tales
maâ€™amselle
o
but
i
will
tell
you
one
story
about
this
if
you
please
that
caterina
told
me
it
was
one
cold
winterâ€™s
night
that
caterina
she
often
came
to
the
castle
then
she
says
to
keep
old
carlo
and
his
wife
company
and
so
he
recommended
her
afterwards
to
the
signor
and
she
has
lived
here
ever
since
caterina
was
sitting
with
them
in
the
little
hall
says
carlo
â€˜i
wish
we
had
some
of
those
figs
to
roast
that
lie
in
the
store-closet
but
it
is
a
long
way
off
and
i
am
loath
to
fetch
them
do
caterinaâ€™
says
he
â€˜for
you
are
young
and
nimble
do
bring
us
some
the
fire
is
in
nice
trim
for
roasting
them
they
lieâ€™
says
he
â€˜in
such
a
corner
of
the
store-room
at
the
end
of
the
north-gallery
here
take
the
lampâ€™
says
he
â€˜and
mind
as
you
go
up
the
great
staircase
that
the
wind
through
the
roof
does
not
blow
it
outâ€™
so
with
that
caterina
took
the
lampâ€”hush
maâ€™amselle
i
surely
heard
a
noiseâ€
emily
whom
annette
had
now
infected
with
her
own
terrors
listened
attentively
but
everything
was
still
and
annette
proceeded
â€œcaterina
went
to
the
north-gallery
that
is
the
wide
gallery
we
passed
maâ€™am
before
we
came
to
the
corridor
here
as
she
went
with
the
lamp
in
her
hand
thinking
of
nothing
at
allâ€”there
againâ€
cried
annette
suddenlyâ€”â€œi
heard
it
againâ€”it
was
not
fancy
maâ€™amselleâ€
â€œhushâ€
said
emily
trembling
they
listened
and
continuing
to
sit
quite
still
emily
heard
a
low
knocking
against
the
wall
it
came
repeatedly
annette
then
screamed
loudly
and
the
chamber
door
slowly
openedâ€”it
was
caterina
come
to
tell
annette
that
her
lady
wanted
her
emily
though
she
now
perceived
who
it
was
could
not
immediately
overcome
her
terror
while
annette
half
laughing
half
crying
scolded
caterina
heartily
for
thus
alarming
them
and
was
also
terrified
lest
what
she
had
told
had
been
overheardâ€”emily
whose
mind
was
deeply
impressed
by
the
chief
circumstance
of
annetteâ€™s
relation
was
unwilling
to
be
left
alone
in
the
present
state
of
her
spirits
but
to
avoid
offending
madame
montoni
and
betraying
her
own
weakness
she
struggled
to
overcome
the
illusions
of
fear
and
dismissed
annette
for
the
night
when
she
was
alone
her
thoughts
recurred
to
the
strange
history
of
signora
laurentini
and
then
to
her
own
strange
situation
in
the
wild
and
solitary
mountains
of
a
foreign
country
in
the
castle
and
the
power
of
a
man
to
whom
only
a
few
preceding
months
she
was
an
entire
stranger
who
had
already
exercised
a
usurped
authority
over
her
and
whose
character
she
now
regarded
with
a
degree
of
terror
apparently
justified
by
the
fears
of
others
she
knew
that
he
had
invention
equal
to
the
conception
and
talents
to
the
execution
of
any
project
and
she
greatly
feared
he
had
a
heart
too
void
of
feeling
to
oppose
the
perpetration
of
whatever
his
interest
might
suggest
she
had
long
observed
the
unhappiness
of
madame
montoni
and
had
often
been
witness
to
the
stern
and
contemptuous
behaviour
she
received
from
her
husband
to
these
circumstances
which
conspired
to
give
her
just
cause
for
alarm
were
now
added
those
thousand
nameless
terrors
which
exist
only
in
active
imaginations
and
which
set
reason
and
examination
equally
at
defiance
emily
remembered
all
that
valancourt
had
told
her
on
the
eve
of
her
departure
from
languedoc
respecting
montoni
and
all
that
he
had
said
to
dissuade
her
from
venturing
on
the
journey
his
fears
had
often
since
appeared
to
her
propheticâ€”now
they
seemed
confirmed
her
heart
as
it
gave
her
back
the
image
of
valancourt
mourned
in
vain
regret
but
reason
soon
came
with
a
consolation
which
though
feeble
at
first
acquired
vigour
from
reflection
she
considered
that
whatever
might
be
her
sufferings
she
had
withheld
from
involving
him
in
misfortune
and
that
whatever
her
future
sorrows
could
be
she
was
at
least
free
from
self-reproach
her
melancholy
was
assisted
by
the
hollow
sighings
of
the
wind
along
the
corridor
and
round
the
castle
the
cheerful
blaze
of
the
wood
had
long
been
extinguished
and
she
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
dying
embers
till
a
loud
gust
that
swept
through
the
corridor
and
shook
the
doors
and
casements
alarmed
her
for
its
violence
had
moved
the
chair
she
had
placed
as
a
fastening
and
the
door
leading
to
the
private
staircase
stood
half
open
her
curiosity
and
her
fears
were
again
awakened
she
took
the
lamp
to
the
top
of
the
steps
and
stood
hesitating
whether
to
go
down
but
again
the
profound
stillness
and
the
gloom
of
the
place
awed
her
and
determining
to
enquire
further
when
daylight
might
assist
the
search
she
closed
the
door
and
placed
against
it
a
stronger
guard
she
now
retired
to
her
bed
leaving
the
lamp
burning
on
the
table
but
its
gloomy
light
instead
of
dispelling
her
fear
assisted
it
for
by
its
uncertain
rays
she
almost
fancied
she
saw
shapes
flit
past
her
curtains
and
glide
into
the
remote
obscurity
of
her
chamberâ€”the
castle
clock
struck
one
before
she
closed
her
eyes
to
sleep
i
think
it
is
the
weakness
of
mine
eyes
that
shapes
this
monstrous
apparition
it
comes
upon
me
julius
cã†sar
daylight
dispelled
from
emilyâ€™s
mind
the
glooms
of
superstition
but
not
those
of
apprehension
the
count
morano
was
the
first
image
that
occurred
to
her
waking
thoughts
and
then
came
a
train
of
anticipated
evils
which
she
could
neither
conquer
nor
avoid
she
rose
and
to
relieve
her
mind
from
the
busy
ideas
that
tormented
it
compelled
herself
to
notice
external
objects
from
her
casement
she
looked
out
upon
the
wild
grandeur
of
the
scene
closed
nearly
on
all
sides
by
alpine
steeps
whose
tops
peeping
over
each
other
faded
from
the
eye
in
misty
hues
while
the
promontories
below
were
dark
with
woods
that
swept
down
to
their
base
and
stretched
along
the
narrow
valleys
the
rich
pomp
of
these
woods
was
particularly
delightful
to
emily
and
she
viewed
with
astonishment
the
fortifications
of
the
castle
spreading
along
a
vast
extent
of
rock
and
now
partly
in
decay
the
grandeur
of
the
ramparts
below
and
the
towers
and
battlements
and
various
features
of
the
fabric
above
from
these
her
sight
wandered
over
the
cliffs
and
woods
into
the
valley
along
which
foamed
a
broad
and
rapid
stream
seen
falling
among
the
crags
of
an
opposite
mountain
now
flashing
in
the
sunbeams
and
now
shadowed
by
over-arching
pines
till
it
was
entirely
concealed
by
their
thick
foliage
again
it
burst
from
beneath
this
darkness
in
one
broad
sheet
of
foam
and
fell
thundering
into
the
vale
nearer
towards
the
west
opened
the
mountain-vista
which
emily
had
viewed
with
such
sublime
emotion
on
her
approach
to
the
castle
a
thin
dusky
vapour
that
rose
from
the
valley
overspread
its
features
with
a
sweet
obscurity
as
this
ascended
and
caught
the
sunbeams
it
kindled
into
a
crimson
tint
and
touched
with
exquisite
beauty
the
woods
and
cliffs
over
which
it
passed
to
the
summit
of
the
mountains
then
as
the
veil
drew
up
it
was
delightful
to
watch
the
gleaming
objects
that
progressively
disclosed
themselves
in
the
valleyâ€”the
green
turfâ€”dark
woodsâ€”little
rocky
recessesâ€”a
few
peasantsâ€™
hutsâ€”the
foaming
streamâ€”a
herd
of
cattle
and
various
images
of
pastoral
beauty
then
the
pine-forests
brightened
and
then
the
broad
breast
of
the
mountains
till
at
length
the
mist
settled
round
their
summit
touching
them
with
a
ruddy
glow
the
features
of
the
vista
now
appeared
distinctly
and
the
broad
deep
shadows
that
fell
from
the
lower
cliffs
gave
strong
effect
to
the
streaming
splendour
above
while
the
mountains
gradually
sinking
in
the
perspective
appeared
to
shelve
into
the
adriatic
sea
for
such
emily
imagined
to
be
the
gleam
of
bluish
light
that
terminated
the
view
thus
she
endeavoured
to
amuse
her
fancy
and
was
not
unsuccessful
the
breezy
freshness
of
the
morning
too
revived
her
she
raised
her
thoughts
in
prayer
which
she
felt
always
most
disposed
to
do
when
viewing
the
sublimity
of
nature
and
her
mind
recovered
its
strength
when
she
turned
from
the
casement
her
eyes
glanced
upon
the
door
she
had
so
carefully
guarded
on
the
preceding
night
and
she
now
determined
to
examine
whither
it
led
but
on
advancing
to
remove
the
chairs
she
perceived
that
they
were
already
moved
a
little
way
her
surprise
cannot
be
easily
imagined
when
in
the
next
minute
she
perceived
that
the
door
was
fastenedâ€”she
felt
as
if
she
had
seen
an
apparition
the
door
of
the
corridor
was
locked
as
she
had
left
it
but
this
door
which
could
be
secured
only
on
the
outside
must
have
been
bolted
during
the
night
she
became
seriously
uneasy
at
the
thought
of
sleeping
again
in
a
chamber
thus
liable
to
intrusion
so
remote
too
as
it
was
from
the
family
and
she
determined
to
mention
the
circumstance
to
madame
montoni
and
to
request
a
change
after
some
perplexity
she
found
her
way
into
the
great
hall
and
to
the
room
which
she
had
left
on
the
preceding
night
where
breakfast
was
spread
and
her
aunt
was
alone
for
montoni
had
been
walking
over
the
environs
of
the
castle
examining
the
condition
of
its
fortifications
and
talking
for
some
time
with
carlo
emily
observed
that
her
aunt
had
been
weeping
and
her
heart
softened
towards
her
with
an
affection
that
showed
itself
in
her
manner
rather
than
in
words
while
she
carefully
avoided
the
appearance
of
having
noticed
that
she
was
unhappy
she
seized
the
opportunity
of
montoniâ€™s
absence
to
mention
the
circumstance
of
the
door
to
request
that
she
might
be
allowed
another
apartment
and
to
enquire
again
concerning
the
occasion
of
their
sudden
journey
on
the
first
subject
her
aunt
referred
her
to
montoni
positively
refusing
to
interfere
in
the
affair
on
the
last
she
professed
utter
ignorance
emily
then
with
a
wish
of
making
her
aunt
more
reconciled
to
her
situation
praised
the
grandeur
of
the
castle
and
the
surrounding
scenery
and
endeavoured
to
soften
every
unpleasing
circumstance
attending
it
but
though
misfortune
had
somewhat
conquered
the
asperities
of
madame
montoniâ€™s
temper
and
by
increasing
her
cares
for
herself
had
taught
her
to
feel
in
some
degree
for
others
the
capricious
love
of
rule
which
nature
had
planted
and
habit
had
nourished
in
her
heart
was
not
subdued
she
could
not
now
deny
herself
the
gratification
of
tyrannising
over
the
innocent
and
helpless
emily
by
attempting
to
ridicule
the
taste
she
could
not
feel
her
satirical
discourse
was
however
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
montoni
and
her
countenance
immediately
assumed
a
mingled
expression
of
fear
and
resentment
while
he
seated
himself
at
the
breakfast-table
as
if
unconscious
of
there
being
any
person
but
himself
in
the
room
emily
as
she
observed
him
in
silence
saw
that
his
countenance
was
darker
and
sterner
than
usual
â€œo
could
i
knowâ€
said
she
to
herself
â€œwhat
passes
in
that
mind
could
i
know
the
thoughts
that
are
known
there
i
should
no
longer
be
condemned
to
this
torturing
suspenseâ€
their
breakfast
passed
in
silence
till
emily
ventured
to
request
that
another
apartment
might
be
allotted
to
her
and
related
the
circumstance
which
made
her
wish
it
â€œi
have
no
time
to
attend
to
these
idle
whimsâ€
said
montoni
â€œthat
chamber
was
prepared
for
you
and
you
must
rest
contented
with
it
it
is
not
probable
that
any
person
would
take
the
trouble
of
going
to
that
remote
staircase
for
the
purpose
of
fastening
a
door
if
it
was
not
fastened
when
you
entered
the
chamber
the
wind
perhaps
shook
the
door
and
made
the
bolts
slide
but
i
know
not
why
i
should
undertake
to
account
for
so
trifling
an
occurrenceâ€
this
explanation
was
by
no
means
satisfactory
to
emily
who
had
observed
that
the
bolts
were
rusted
and
consequently
could
not
be
thus
easily
moved
but
she
forbore
to
say
so
and
repeated
her
request
â€œif
you
will
not
release
yourself
from
the
slavery
of
these
fearsâ€
said
montoni
sternly
â€œat
least
forbear
to
torment
others
by
the
mention
of
them
conquer
such
whims
and
endeavour
to
strengthen
your
mind
no
existence
is
more
contemptible
than
that
which
is
embittered
by
fearâ€
as
he
said
this
his
eye
glanced
upon
madame
montoni
who
coloured
highly
but
was
still
silent
emily
wounded
and
disappointed
thought
her
fears
were
in
this
instance
too
reasonable
to
deserve
ridicule
but
perceiving
that
however
they
might
oppress
her
she
must
endure
them
she
tried
to
withdraw
her
attention
from
the
subject
carlo
soon
after
entered
with
some
fruit
â€œyour
excellenza
is
tired
after
your
long
rambleâ€
said
he
as
he
set
the
fruit
upon
the
table
â€œbut
you
have
more
to
see
after
breakfast
there
is
a
place
in
the
vaulted
passage
leading
toâ€”â€
montoni
frowned
upon
him
and
waved
his
hand
for
him
to
leave
the
room
carlo
stopped
looked
down
and
then
added
as
he
advanced
to
the
breakfast-table
and
took
up
the
basket
of
fruit
â€œi
made
bold
your
excellenza
to
bring
some
cherries
here
for
my
honoured
lady
and
my
young
mistress
will
your
ladyship
taste
them
madamâ€
said
carlo
presenting
the
basket
â€œthey
are
very
fine
ones
though
i
gathered
them
myself
and
from
an
old
tree
that
catches
all
the
south
sun
they
are
as
big
as
plums
your
ladyshipâ€
â€œvery
well
old
carloâ€
said
madame
montoni
â€œi
am
obliged
to
youâ€
â€œand
the
young
signora
too
she
may
like
some
of
themâ€
rejoined
carlo
turning
with
the
basket
to
emily
â€œit
will
do
me
good
to
see
her
eat
someâ€
â€œthank
you
carloâ€
said
emily
taking
some
cherries
and
smiling
kindly
â€œcome
comeâ€
said
montoni
impatiently
â€œenough
of
this
leave
the
room
but
be
in
waiting
i
shall
want
you
presentlyâ€
carlo
obeyed
and
montoni
soon
after
went
out
to
examine
further
into
the
state
of
the
castle
while
emily
remained
with
her
aunt
patiently
enduring
her
ill
humour
and
endeavouring
with
much
sweetness
to
soothe
her
affliction
instead
of
resenting
its
effect
when
madame
montoni
retired
to
her
dressing-room
emily
endeavoured
to
amuse
herself
by
a
view
of
the
castle
through
a
folding
door
she
passed
from
the
great
hall
to
the
ramparts
which
extended
along
the
brow
of
the
precipice
round
three
sides
of
the
edifice
the
fourth
was
guarded
by
the
high
walls
of
the
courts
and
by
the
gateway
through
which
she
had
passed
on
the
preceding
evening
the
grandeur
of
the
broad
ramparts
and
the
changing
scenery
they
overlooked
excited
her
high
admiration
for
the
extent
of
the
terraces
allowed
the
features
of
the
country
to
be
seen
in
such
various
points
of
view
that
they
appeared
to
form
new
landscapes
she
often
paused
to
examine
the
gothic
magnificence
of
udolpho
its
proud
irregularity
its
lofty
towers
and
battlements
its
high-arched
casements
and
its
slender
watch-towers
perched
upon
the
corners
of
turrets
then
she
would
lean
on
the
wall
of
the
terrace
and
shuddering
measure
with
her
eye
the
precipice
below
till
the
dark
summits
of
the
woods
arrested
it
wherever
she
turned
appeared
mountain-tops
forests
of
pine
and
narrow
glens
opening
among
the
apennines
and
retiring
from
the
sight
into
inaccessible
regions
while
she
thus
leaned
montoni
followed
by
two
men
appeared
ascending
a
winding
path
cut
in
the
rock
below
he
stopped
upon
a
cliff
and
pointing
to
the
ramparts
turned
to
his
followers
and
talked
with
much
eagerness
of
gesticulationâ€”emily
perceived
that
one
of
these
men
was
carlo
the
other
was
in
the
dress
of
a
peasant
and
he
alone
seemed
to
be
receiving
the
directions
of
montoni
she
withdrew
from
the
walls
and
pursued
her
walk
till
she
heard
at
a
distance
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
and
then
the
loud
bell
of
the
portal
when
it
instantly
occurred
to
her
that
count
morano
was
arrived
as
she
hastily
passed
the
folding
doors
from
the
terrace
towards
her
own
apartment
several
persons
entered
the
hall
by
an
opposite
door
she
saw
them
at
the
extremities
of
the
arcades
and
immediately
retreated
but
the
agitation
of
her
spirits
and
the
extent
and
duskiness
of
the
hall
had
prevented
her
from
distinguishing
the
persons
of
the
strangers
her
fears
however
had
but
one
object
and
they
had
called
up
that
object
to
her
fancyâ€”she
believed
that
she
had
seen
count
morano
when
she
thought
that
they
had
passed
the
hall
she
ventured
again
to
the
door
and
proceeded
unobserved
to
her
room
where
she
remained
agitated
with
apprehensions
and
listening
to
every
distant
sound
at
length
hearing
voices
on
the
rampart
she
hastened
to
her
window
and
observed
montoni
with
signor
cavigni
walking
below
conversing
earnestly
and
often
stopping
and
turning
towards
each
other
at
which
time
their
discourse
seemed
to
be
uncommonly
interesting
of
the
several
persons
who
had
appeared
in
the
hall
here
was
cavigni
alone
but
emilyâ€™s
alarm
was
soon
after
heightened
by
the
steps
of
some
one
in
the
corridor
who
she
apprehended
brought
a
message
from
the
count
in
the
next
moment
annette
appeared
â€œah
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
she
â€œhere
is
the
signor
cavigni
arrived
i
am
sure
i
rejoiced
to
see
a
christian
person
in
this
place
and
then
he
is
so
good
natured
too
he
always
takes
so
much
notice
of
meâ€”and
here
is
also
signor
verezzi
and
who
do
you
think
besides
maâ€™amselleâ€
â€œi
cannot
guess
annette
tell
me
quicklyâ€
â€œnay
maâ€™am
do
guess
onceâ€
â€œwell
thenâ€
said
emily
with
assumed
composure
â€œit
isâ€”count
morano
i
supposeâ€
â€œholy
virginâ€
cried
annette
â€œare
you
ill
maâ€™amselle
you
are
going
to
faint
let
me
get
some
waterâ€
emily
sunk
into
a
chair
â€œstay
annetteâ€
said
she
feebly
â€œdo
not
leave
meâ€”i
shall
soon
be
better
open
the
casementâ€”the
count
you
sayâ€”he
is
come
thenâ€
â€œwho
iâ€”the
count
no
maâ€™amselle
i
did
not
say
soâ€
â€œhe
is
not
come
thenâ€
said
emily
eagerly
â€œno
maâ€™amselleâ€
â€œyou
are
sure
of
itâ€
â€œlord
bless
meâ€
said
annette
â€œyou
recover
very
suddenly
maâ€™am
why
i
thought
you
were
dying
just
nowâ€
â€œbut
the
countâ€”you
are
sure
is
not
comeâ€
â€œo
yes
quite
sure
of
that
maâ€™amselle
why
i
was
looking
out
through
the
grate
in
the
north
turret
when
the
carriages
drove
into
the
courtyard
and
i
never
expected
to
see
such
a
goodly
sight
in
this
dismal
old
castle
but
here
are
masters
and
servants
too
enough
to
make
the
place
ring
again
o
i
was
ready
to
leap
through
the
rusty
old
bars
for
joyâ€”o
who
would
ever
have
thought
of
seeing
a
christian
face
in
this
huge
dreary
house
i
could
have
kissed
the
very
horses
that
brought
themâ€
â€œwell
annette
well
i
am
better
nowâ€
â€œyes
maâ€™amselle
i
see
you
are
o
all
the
servants
will
lead
merry
lives
here
now
we
shall
have
singing
and
dancing
in
the
little
hall
for
the
signor
cannot
hear
us
thereâ€”and
droll
storiesâ€”ludovicoâ€™s
come
maâ€™am
yes
there
is
ludovico
come
with
them
you
remember
ludovico
maâ€™amâ€”a
tall
handsome
young
manâ€”signor
cavigniâ€™s
lacqueyâ€”who
always
wears
his
cloak
with
such
a
grace
thrown
round
his
left
arm
and
his
hat
set
on
so
smartly
all
on
one
side
andâ€”â€
â€œnoâ€
said
emily
who
was
wearied
by
her
loquacity
â€œwhat
maâ€™amselle
donâ€™t
you
remember
ludovicoâ€”who
rowed
the
cavalieroâ€™s
gondola
at
the
last
regatta
and
won
the
prize
and
who
used
to
sing
such
sweet
verses
about
orlandos
and
about
the
black-a-moors
too
and
charlyâ€”charlyâ€”magne
yes
that
was
the
name
all
under
my
lattice
in
the
west
portico
on
the
moonlight
nights
at
venice
o
i
have
listened
to
himâ€”â€
â€œi
fear
to
thy
peril
my
good
annetteâ€
said
emily
â€œfor
it
seems
his
verses
have
stolen
thy
heart
but
let
me
advise
you
if
it
is
so
keep
the
secret
never
let
him
know
itâ€
â€œahâ€”maâ€™amselleâ€”how
can
one
keep
such
a
secret
as
thatâ€
â€œwell
annette
i
am
now
so
much
better
that
you
may
leave
meâ€
â€œo
but
maâ€™amselle
i
forgot
to
askâ€”how
did
you
sleep
in
this
dreary
old
chamber
last
nightâ€â€”â€œas
well
as
usualâ€â€”â€œdid
you
hear
no
noisesâ€â€”â€œnoneâ€â€”â€œnor
see
anythingâ€â€”â€œnothingâ€â€”â€œwell
that
is
surprisingâ€â€”â€œnot
in
the
least
and
now
tell
me
why
you
ask
these
questionsâ€
â€œo
maâ€™amselle
i
would
not
tell
you
for
the
world
nor
all
i
have
heard
about
this
chamber
either
it
would
frighten
you
soâ€
â€œif
that
is
all
you
have
frightened
me
already
and
may
therefore
tell
me
what
you
know
without
hurting
your
conscienceâ€
â€œo
lord
they
say
the
room
is
haunted
and
has
been
so
these
many
yearsâ€
â€œit
is
by
a
ghost
then
who
can
draw
boltsâ€
said
emily
endeavouring
to
laugh
away
her
apprehensions
â€œfor
i
left
the
door
open
last
night
and
found
it
fastened
this
morningâ€
annette
turned
pale
and
said
not
a
word
â€œdo
you
know
whether
any
of
the
servants
fastened
this
door
in
the
morning
before
i
roseâ€
â€œno
maâ€™am
that
i
will
be
bound
they
did
not
but
i
donâ€™t
know
shall
i
go
and
ask
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
moving
hastily
towards
the
corridor
â€œstay
annette
i
have
another
question
to
ask
tell
me
what
you
have
heard
concerning
this
room
and
whither
that
staircase
leadsâ€
â€œi
will
go
and
ask
it
all
directly
maâ€™am
besides
i
am
sure
my
lady
wants
me
i
cannot
stay
now
indeed
maâ€™amâ€
she
hurried
from
the
room
without
waiting
emilyâ€™s
reply
whose
heart
lightened
by
the
certainty
that
morano
was
not
arrived
allowed
her
to
smile
at
the
superstitious
terror
which
had
seized
on
annette
for
though
she
sometimes
felt
its
influence
herself
she
could
smile
at
it
when
apparent
in
other
persons
montoni
having
refused
emily
another
chamber
she
determined
to
bear
with
patience
the
evil
she
could
not
remove
and
in
order
to
make
the
room
as
comfortable
as
possible
unpacked
her
books
her
sweet
delight
in
happier
days
and
her
soothing
resource
in
the
hours
of
moderate
sorrow
but
there
were
hours
when
even
these
failed
of
their
effect
when
the
genius
the
taste
the
enthusiasm
of
the
sublimest
writers
were
felt
no
longer
her
little
library
being
arranged
on
a
high
chest
part
of
the
furniture
of
the
room
she
took
out
her
drawing
utensils
and
was
tranquil
enough
to
be
pleased
with
the
thought
of
sketching
the
sublime
scenes
beheld
from
her
windows
but
she
suddenly
checked
this
pleasure
remembering
how
often
she
had
soothed
herself
by
the
intention
of
obtaining
amusement
of
this
kind
and
had
been
prevented
by
some
new
circumstance
of
misfortune
â€œhow
can
i
suffer
myself
to
be
deluded
by
hopeâ€
said
she
â€œand
because
count
morano
is
not
yet
arrived
feel
a
momentary
happiness
alas
what
is
it
to
me
whether
he
is
here
today
or
tomorrow
if
he
comes
at
allâ€”and
that
he
will
comeâ€”it
were
weakness
to
doubtâ€
to
withdraw
her
thoughts
however
from
the
subject
of
her
misfortunes
she
attempted
to
read
but
her
attention
wandered
from
the
page
and
at
length
she
threw
aside
the
book
and
determined
to
explore
the
adjoining
chambers
of
the
castle
her
imagination
was
pleased
with
the
view
of
ancient
grandeur
and
an
emotion
of
melancholy
awe
awakened
all
its
powers
as
she
walked
through
rooms
obscure
and
desolate
where
no
footsteps
had
passed
probably
for
many
years
and
remembered
the
strange
history
of
the
former
possessor
of
the
edifice
this
brought
to
her
recollection
the
veiled
picture
which
had
attracted
her
curiosity
on
the
preceding
night
and
she
resolved
to
examine
it
as
she
passed
through
the
chambers
that
led
to
this
she
found
herself
somewhat
agitated
its
connection
with
the
late
lady
of
the
castle
and
the
conversation
of
annette
together
with
the
circumstance
of
the
veil
throwing
a
mystery
over
the
subject
that
excited
a
faint
degree
of
terror
but
a
terror
of
this
nature
as
it
occupies
and
expands
the
mind
and
elevates
it
to
high
expectation
is
purely
sublime
and
leads
us
by
a
kind
of
fascination
to
seek
even
the
object
from
which
we
appear
to
shrink
emily
passed
on
with
faltering
steps
and
having
paused
a
moment
at
the
door
before
she
attempted
to
open
it
she
then
hastily
entered
the
chamber
and
went
towards
the
picture
which
appeared
to
be
enclosed
in
a
frame
of
uncommon
size
that
hung
in
a
dark
part
of
the
room
she
paused
again
and
then
with
a
timid
hand
lifted
the
veil
but
instantly
let
it
fallâ€”perceiving
that
what
it
had
concealed
was
no
picture
and
before
she
could
leave
the
chamber
she
dropped
senseless
on
the
floor
when
she
recovered
her
recollection
the
remembrance
of
what
she
had
seen
had
nearly
deprived
her
of
it
a
second
time
she
had
scarcely
strength
to
remove
from
the
room
and
regain
her
own
and
when
arrived
there
wanted
courage
to
remain
alone
horror
occupied
her
mind
and
excluded
for
a
time
all
sense
of
past
and
dread
of
future
misfortune
she
seated
herself
near
the
casement
because
from
thence
she
heard
voices
though
distant
on
the
terrace
and
might
see
people
pass
and
these
trifling
as
they
were
were
reviving
circumstances
when
her
spirits
had
recovered
their
tone
she
considered
whether
she
should
mention
what
she
had
seen
to
madame
montoni
and
various
and
important
motives
urged
her
to
do
so
among
which
the
least
was
the
hope
of
the
relief
which
an
overburdened
mind
finds
in
speaking
of
the
subject
of
its
interest
but
she
was
aware
of
the
terrible
consequences
which
such
a
communication
might
lead
to
and
dreading
the
indiscretion
of
her
aunt
at
length
endeavoured
to
arm
herself
with
resolution
to
observe
a
profound
silence
on
the
subject
montoni
and
verezzi
soon
after
passed
under
the
casement
speaking
cheerfully
and
their
voices
revived
her
presently
the
signors
bertolini
and
cavigni
joined
the
party
on
the
terrace
and
emily
supposing
that
madame
montoni
was
then
alone
went
to
seek
her
for
the
solitude
of
her
chamber
and
its
proximity
to
that
where
she
had
received
so
severe
a
shock
again
affected
her
spirit
she
found
her
aunt
in
her
dressing-room
preparing
for
dinner
emilyâ€™s
pale
and
affrighted
countenance
alarmed
even
madame
montoni
but
she
had
sufficient
strength
of
mind
to
be
silent
on
the
subject
that
still
made
her
shudder
and
which
was
ready
to
burst
from
her
lips
in
her
auntâ€™s
apartment
she
remained
till
they
both
descended
to
dinner
there
she
met
the
gentlemen
lately
arrived
who
had
a
kind
of
busy
seriousness
in
their
looks
which
was
somewhat
unusual
with
them
while
their
thoughts
seemed
too
much
occupied
by
some
deep
interest
to
suffer
them
to
bestow
much
attention
either
on
emily
or
madame
montoni
they
spoke
little
and
montoni
less
emily
as
she
now
looked
on
him
shuddered
the
horror
of
the
chamber
rushed
on
her
mind
several
times
the
colour
faded
from
her
cheeks
and
she
feared
that
illness
would
betray
her
emotions
and
compel
her
to
leave
the
room
but
the
strength
of
her
resolution
remedied
the
weakness
of
her
frame
she
obliged
herself
to
converse
and
even
tried
to
look
cheerful
montoni
evidently
laboured
under
some
vexation
such
as
would
probably
have
agitated
a
weaker
mind
or
a
more
susceptible
heart
but
which
appeared
from
the
sternness
of
his
countenance
only
to
bend
up
his
faculties
to
energy
and
fortitude
it
was
a
comfortless
and
silent
meal
the
gloom
of
the
castle
seemed
to
have
spread
its
contagion
even
over
the
gay
countenance
of
cavigni
and
with
this
gloom
was
mingled
a
fierceness
such
as
she
had
seldom
seen
him
indicate
count
morano
was
not
named
and
what
conversation
there
was
turned
chiefly
upon
the
wars
which
at
that
time
agitated
the
italian
states
the
strength
of
the
venetian
armies
and
the
characters
of
their
generals
after
dinner
when
the
servants
had
withdrawn
emily
learned
that
the
cavalier
who
had
drawn
upon
himself
the
vengeance
of
orsino
had
since
died
of
his
wounds
and
that
strict
search
was
still
making
for
his
murderer
the
intelligence
seemed
to
disturb
montoni
who
mused
and
then
enquired
where
orsino
had
concealed
himself
his
guests
who
all
except
cavigni
were
ignorant
that
montoni
had
himself
assisted
him
to
escape
from
venice
replied
that
he
had
fled
in
the
night
with
such
precipitation
and
secrecy
that
his
most
intimate
companions
knew
not
whither
montoni
blamed
himself
for
having
asked
the
question
for
a
second
thought
convinced
him
that
a
man
of
orsinoâ€™s
suspicious
temper
was
not
likely
to
trust
any
of
the
persons
present
with
the
knowledge
of
his
asylum
he
considered
himself
however
as
entitled
to
his
utmost
confidence
and
did
not
doubt
that
he
should
soon
hear
of
him
emily
retired
with
madame
montoni
soon
after
the
cloth
was
withdrawn
and
left
the
cavaliers
to
their
secret
councils
but
not
before
the
significant
frowns
of
montoni
had
warned
his
wife
to
depart
who
passed
from
the
hall
to
the
ramparts
and
walked
for
some
time
in
silence
which
emily
did
not
interrupt
for
her
mind
was
also
occupied
by
interests
of
its
own
it
required
all
her
resolution
to
forbear
communicating
to
madame
montoni
the
terrible
subject
which
still
thrilled
her
every
nerve
with
horror
and
sometimes
she
was
on
the
point
of
doing
so
merely
to
obtain
the
relief
of
a
moment
but
she
knew
how
wholly
she
was
in
the
power
of
montoni
and
considering
that
the
indiscretion
of
her
aunt
might
prove
fatal
to
them
both
she
compelled
herself
to
endure
a
present
and
an
inferior
evil
rather
than
to
tempt
a
future
and
a
heavier
one
a
strange
kind
of
presentiment
frequently
on
this
day
occurred
to
herâ€”it
seemed
as
if
her
fate
rested
here
and
was
by
some
invisible
means
connected
with
this
castle
â€œlet
me
not
accelerate
itâ€
said
she
to
herself
â€œfor
whatever
i
may
be
reserved
let
me
at
least
avoid
self-reproachâ€
as
she
looked
on
the
massy
walls
of
the
edifice
her
melancholy
spirits
represented
it
to
be
her
prison
and
she
started
as
at
a
new
suggestion
when
she
considered
how
far
distant
she
was
from
her
native
country
from
her
little
peaceful
home
and
from
her
only
friendâ€”how
remote
was
her
hope
of
happiness
how
feeble
the
expectation
of
again
seeing
him
yet
the
idea
of
valancourt
and
her
confidence
in
his
faithful
love
had
hitherto
been
her
only
solace
and
she
struggled
hard
to
retain
them
a
few
tears
of
agony
started
to
her
eyes
which
she
turned
aside
to
conceal
while
she
afterwards
leaned
on
the
wall
of
the
rampart
some
peasants
at
a
little
distance
were
seen
examining
a
breach
before
which
lay
a
heap
of
stones
as
if
to
repair
it
and
a
rusty
old
cannon
that
appeared
to
have
fallen
from
its
station
above
madame
montoni
stopped
to
speak
to
the
men
and
enquired
what
they
were
going
to
do
â€œto
repair
the
fortifications
your
ladyshipâ€
said
one
of
them
a
labour
which
she
was
somewhat
surprised
that
montoni
should
think
necessary
particularly
since
he
had
never
spoken
of
the
castle
as
of
a
place
at
which
he
meant
to
reside
for
any
considerable
time
but
she
passed
on
towards
a
lofty
arch
that
led
from
the
south
to
the
east
rampart
and
which
adjoined
the
castle
on
one
side
while
on
the
other
it
supported
a
small
watch-tower
that
entirely
commanded
the
deep
valley
below
as
she
approached
this
arch
she
saw
beyond
it
winding
along
the
woody
descent
of
a
distant
mountain
a
long
troop
of
horse
and
foot
whom
she
knew
to
be
soldiers
only
by
the
glitter
of
their
pikes
and
other
arms
for
the
distance
did
not
allow
her
to
discover
the
colour
of
their
liveries
as
she
gazed
the
vanguard
issued
from
the
woods
into
the
valley
but
the
train
still
continued
to
pour
over
the
remote
summit
of
the
mountain
in
endless
succession
while
in
the
front
the
military
uniform
became
distinguishable
and
the
commanders
riding
first
and
seeming
by
their
gestures
to
direct
the
march
of
those
that
followed
at
length
approached
very
near
to
the
castle
such
a
spectacle
in
these
solitary
regions
both
surprised
and
alarmed
madame
montoni
and
she
hastened
towards
some
peasants
who
were
employed
in
raising
bastions
before
the
south
rampart
where
the
rock
was
less
abrupt
than
elsewhere
these
men
could
give
no
satisfactory
answers
to
her
enquiries
but
being
roused
by
them
gazed
in
stupid
astonishment
upon
the
long
cavalcade
madame
montoni
then
thinking
it
necessary
to
communicate
further
the
object
of
her
alarm
sent
emily
to
say
that
she
wished
to
speak
to
montoni
an
errand
her
niece
did
not
approve
for
she
dreaded
his
frowns
which
she
knew
this
message
would
provoke
but
she
obeyed
in
silence
as
she
drew
near
the
apartment
in
which
he
sat
with
his
guests
she
heard
them
in
earnest
and
loud
dispute
and
she
paused
a
moment
trembling
at
the
displeasure
which
her
sudden
interruption
would
occasion
in
the
next
their
voices
sunk
all
together
she
then
ventured
to
open
the
door
and
while
montoni
turned
hastily
and
looked
at
her
without
speaking
she
delivered
her
message
â€œtell
madam
montoni
i
am
engagedâ€
said
he
emily
then
thought
it
proper
to
mention
the
subject
of
her
alarm
montoni
and
his
companions
rose
instantly
and
went
to
the
windows
but
these
not
affording
them
a
view
of
the
troops
they
at
length
proceeded
to
the
ramparts
where
cavigni
conjectured
it
to
be
a
legion
of
condottieri
on
their
march
towards
modena
one
part
of
the
cavalcade
now
extended
along
the
valley
and
another
wound
among
the
mountains
towards
the
north
while
some
troops
still
lingered
on
the
woody
precipices
where
the
first
had
appeared
so
that
the
great
length
of
the
procession
seemed
to
include
a
whole
army
while
montoni
and
his
family
watched
its
progress
they
heard
the
sound
of
trumpets
and
the
clash
of
cymbals
in
the
vale
and
then
others
answering
from
the
heights
emily
listened
with
emotion
to
the
shrill
blast
that
woke
the
echoes
of
the
mountains
and
montoni
explained
the
signals
with
which
he
appeared
to
be
well
acquainted
and
which
meant
nothing
hostile
the
uniforms
of
the
troops
and
the
kind
of
arms
they
bore
confirmed
to
him
the
conjecture
of
cavigni
and
he
had
the
satisfaction
to
see
them
pass
by
without
even
stopping
to
gaze
upon
his
castle
he
did
not
however
leave
the
rampart
till
the
bases
of
the
mountains
had
shut
them
from
his
view
and
the
last
murmur
of
the
trumpet
floated
away
on
the
wind
cavigni
and
verezzi
were
inspirited
by
this
spectacle
which
seemed
to
have
roused
all
the
fire
of
their
temper
montoni
turned
into
the
castle
in
thoughtful
silence
emilyâ€™s
mind
had
not
yet
sufficiently
recovered
from
its
late
shock
to
endure
the
loneliness
of
her
chamber
and
she
remained
upon
the
ramparts
for
madame
montoni
had
not
invited
her
to
her
dressing-room
whither
she
had
gone
evidently
in
low
spirits
and
emily
from
her
late
experience
had
lost
all
wish
to
explore
the
gloomy
and
mysterious
recesses
of
the
castle
the
ramparts
therefore
were
almost
her
only
retreat
and
here
she
lingered
till
the
grey
haze
of
evening
was
again
spread
over
the
scene
the
cavaliers
supped
by
themselves
and
madame
montoni
remained
in
her
apartment
whither
emily
went
before
she
retired
to
her
own
she
found
her
aunt
weeping
and
in
much
agitation
the
tenderness
of
emily
was
naturally
so
soothing
that
it
seldom
failed
to
give
comfort
to
the
drooping
heart
but
madame
montoniâ€™s
was
torn
and
the
softest
accents
of
emilyâ€™s
voice
were
lost
upon
it
with
her
usual
delicacy
she
did
not
appear
to
observe
her
auntâ€™s
distress
but
it
gave
an
involuntary
gentleness
to
her
manners
and
an
air
of
solicitude
to
her
countenance
which
madame
montoni
was
vexed
to
perceive
who
seemed
to
feel
the
pity
of
her
niece
to
be
an
insult
to
her
pride
and
dismissed
her
as
soon
as
she
properly
could
emily
did
not
venture
to
mention
again
the
reluctance
she
felt
to
her
gloomy
chamber
but
she
requested
that
annette
might
be
permitted
to
remain
with
her
till
she
retired
to
rest
and
the
request
was
somewhat
reluctantly
granted
annette
however
was
now
with
the
servants
and
emily
withdrew
alone
with
light
and
hasty
steps
she
passed
through
the
long
galleries
while
the
feeble
glimmer
of
the
lamp
she
carried
only
showed
the
gloom
around
her
and
the
passing
air
threatened
to
extinguish
it
the
lonely
silence
that
reigned
in
this
part
of
the
castle
awed
her
now
and
then
indeed
she
heard
a
faint
peal
of
laughter
rise
from
a
remote
part
of
the
edifice
where
the
servants
were
assembled
but
it
was
soon
lost
and
a
kind
of
breathless
stillness
remained
as
she
passed
the
suite
of
rooms
which
she
had
visited
in
the
morning
her
eyes
glanced
fearfully
on
the
door
and
she
almost
fancied
she
heard
murmuring
sounds
within
but
she
paused
not
a
moment
to
enquire
having
reached
her
own
apartment
where
no
blazing
wood
on
the
hearth
dissipated
the
gloom
she
sat
down
with
a
book
to
enliven
her
attention
till
annette
should
come
and
a
fire
could
be
kindled
she
continued
to
read
till
her
light
was
nearly
expired
but
annette
did
not
appear
and
the
solitude
and
obscurity
of
her
chamber
again
affected
her
spirits
the
more
because
of
its
nearness
to
the
scene
of
horror
that
she
had
witnessed
in
the
morning
gloomy
and
fantastic
images
came
to
her
mind
she
looked
fearfully
towards
the
door
of
the
staircase
and
then
examining
whether
it
was
still
fastened
found
that
it
was
so
unable
to
conquer
the
uneasiness
she
felt
at
the
prospect
of
sleeping
again
in
this
remote
and
insecure
apartment
which
some
person
seemed
to
have
entered
during
the
preceding
night
her
impatience
to
see
annette
whom
she
had
bidden
to
enquire
concerning
this
circumstance
became
extremely
painful
she
wished
also
to
question
her
as
to
the
object
which
had
excited
so
much
horror
in
her
own
mind
and
which
annette
on
the
preceding
evening
had
appeared
to
be
in
part
acquainted
with
though
her
words
were
very
remote
from
the
truth
and
it
appeared
plainly
to
emily
that
the
girl
had
been
purposely
misled
by
a
false
report
above
all
she
was
surprised
that
the
door
of
the
chamber
which
contained
it
should
be
left
unguarded
such
an
instance
of
negligence
almost
surpassed
belief
but
her
light
was
now
expiring
the
faint
flashes
it
threw
upon
the
walls
called
up
all
the
terrors
of
fancy
and
she
rose
to
find
her
way
to
the
habitable
part
of
the
castle
before
it
was
quite
extinguished
as
she
opened
the
chamber
door
she
heard
remote
voices
and
soon
after
saw
a
light
issue
upon
the
further
end
of
the
corridor
which
annette
and
another
servant
approached
â€œi
am
glad
you
are
comeâ€
said
emily
â€œwhat
has
detained
you
so
long
pray
light
me
a
fire
immediatelyâ€
â€œmy
lady
wanted
me
maâ€™amselleâ€
replied
annette
in
some
confusion
â€œi
will
go
and
get
the
woodâ€
â€œnoâ€
said
caterina
â€œthat
is
my
businessâ€
and
left
the
room
instantly
while
annette
would
have
followed
but
being
called
back
she
began
to
talk
very
loud
and
laugh
and
seemed
afraid
to
trust
a
pause
of
silence
caterina
soon
returned
with
the
wood
and
then
when
the
cheerful
blaze
once
more
animated
the
room
and
this
servant
had
withdrawn
emily
asked
annette
whether
she
had
made
the
enquiry
she
bade
her
â€œyes
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œbut
not
a
soul
knows
anything
about
the
matter
and
old
carloâ€”i
watched
him
well
for
they
say
he
knows
strange
thingsâ€”old
carlo
looked
so
as
i
donâ€™t
know
how
to
tell
and
he
asked
me
again
and
again
if
i
was
sure
the
door
was
ever
unfastened
lord
says
iâ€”am
i
sure
i
am
alive
and
as
for
me
maâ€™am
i
am
all
astounded
as
one
may
say
and
would
no
more
sleep
in
this
chamber
than
i
would
on
the
great
cannon
at
the
end
of
the
east
rampartâ€
â€œand
what
objection
have
you
to
that
cannon
more
than
to
any
of
the
restâ€
said
emily
smiling
â€œthe
best
would
be
rather
a
hard
bedâ€
â€œyes
maâ€™amselle
any
of
them
would
be
hard
enough
for
that
matter
but
they
do
say
that
something
has
been
seen
in
the
dead
of
night
standing
beside
the
great
cannon
as
if
to
guard
itâ€
â€œwell
my
good
annette
the
people
who
tell
such
stories
are
happy
in
having
you
for
an
auditor
for
i
perceive
you
believe
them
allâ€
â€œdear
maâ€™amselle
i
will
show
you
the
very
cannon
you
can
see
it
from
these
windowsâ€
â€œwellâ€
said
emily
â€œbut
that
does
not
prove
that
an
apparition
guards
itâ€
â€œwhat
not
if
i
show
you
the
very
cannon
dear
maâ€™am
you
will
believe
nothingâ€
â€œnothing
probably
upon
this
subject
but
what
i
seeâ€
said
emilyâ€”â€œwell
maâ€™am
but
you
shall
see
it
if
you
will
only
step
this
way
to
the
casementâ€â€”emily
could
not
forbear
laughing
and
annette
looked
surprised
perceiving
her
extreme
aptitude
to
credit
the
marvellous
emily
forbore
to
mention
the
subject
she
had
intended
lest
it
should
overcome
her
with
idle
terrors
and
she
began
to
speak
on
a
lively
topicâ€”the
regattas
of
venice
â€œaye
maâ€™amselle
those
rowing
matchesâ€
said
annette
â€œand
the
fine
moonlight
nights
are
all
that
are
worth
seeing
in
venice
to
be
sure
the
moon
is
brighter
than
any
i
ever
saw
and
then
to
hear
such
sweet
music
too
as
ludovico
has
often
and
often
sung
under
the
lattice
by
the
west
portico
maâ€™amselle
it
was
ludovico
that
told
me
about
that
picture
which
you
wanted
so
to
look
at
last
night
andâ€”â€
â€œwhat
pictureâ€
said
emily
wishing
annette
to
explain
herself
â€œo
that
terrible
picture
with
the
black
veil
over
itâ€
â€œyou
never
saw
it
thenâ€
said
emily
â€œwho
iâ€”no
maâ€™amselle
i
never
did
but
this
morningâ€
continued
annette
lowering
her
voice
and
looking
round
the
room
â€œthis
morning
as
it
was
broad
daylight
do
you
know
maâ€™am
i
took
a
strange
fancy
to
see
it
as
i
had
heard
such
odd
hints
about
it
and
i
got
as
far
as
the
door
and
should
have
opened
it
if
it
had
not
been
lockedâ€
emily
endeavouring
to
conceal
the
emotion
this
circumstance
occasioned
enquired
at
what
hour
she
went
to
the
chamber
and
found
that
it
was
soon
after
herself
had
been
there
she
also
asked
further
questions
and
the
answers
convinced
her
that
annette
and
probably
her
informer
were
ignorant
of
the
terrible
truth
though
in
annetteâ€™s
account
something
very
like
the
truth
now
and
then
mingled
with
the
falsehood
emily
now
began
to
fear
that
her
visit
to
the
chamber
had
been
observed
since
the
door
had
been
closed
so
immediately
after
her
departure
and
dreaded
lest
this
should
draw
upon
her
the
vengeance
of
montoni
her
anxiety
also
was
excited
to
know
whence
and
for
what
purpose
the
delusive
report
which
had
been
imposed
upon
annette
had
originated
since
montoni
could
only
have
wished
for
silence
and
secrecy
but
she
felt
that
the
subject
was
too
terrible
for
this
lonely
hour
and
she
compelled
herself
to
leave
it
to
converse
with
annette
whose
chat
simple
as
it
was
she
preferred
to
the
stillness
of
total
solitude
thus
they
sat
till
near
midnight
but
not
without
many
hints
from
annette
that
she
wished
to
go
the
embers
were
now
nearly
burnt
out
and
emily
heard
at
a
distance
the
thundering
sound
of
the
hall
doors
as
they
were
shut
for
the
night
she
therefore
prepared
for
rest
but
was
still
unwilling
that
annette
should
leave
her
at
this
instant
the
great
bell
of
the
portal
sounded
they
listened
in
fearful
expectation
when
after
a
long
pause
of
silence
it
sounded
again
soon
after
they
heard
the
noise
of
carriage
wheels
in
the
courtyard
emily
sunk
almost
lifeless
in
her
chair
â€œit
is
the
countâ€
said
she
â€œwhat
at
this
time
of
night
maâ€™amâ€
said
annette
â€œno
my
dear
lady
but
for
that
matter
it
is
a
strange
time
of
night
for
anybody
to
comeâ€
â€œnay
prâ€™ythee
good
annette
stay
not
talkingâ€
said
emily
in
a
voice
of
agonyâ€”â€œgo
prâ€™ythee
go
and
see
who
it
isâ€
annette
left
the
room
and
carried
with
her
the
light
leaving
emily
in
darkness
which
a
few
moments
before
would
have
terrified
her
in
this
room
but
was
now
scarcely
observed
by
her
she
listened
and
waited
in
breathless
expectation
and
heard
distant
noises
but
annette
did
not
return
her
patience
at
length
exhausted
she
tried
to
find
her
way
to
the
corridor
but
it
was
long
before
she
could
touch
the
door
of
the
chamber
and
when
she
had
opened
it
the
total
darkness
without
made
her
fear
to
proceed
voices
were
now
heard
and
emily
even
thought
she
distinguished
those
of
count
morano
and
montoni
soon
after
she
heard
steps
approaching
and
then
a
ray
of
light
streamed
through
the
darkness
and
annette
appeared
whom
emily
went
to
meet
â€œyes
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
she
â€œyou
were
right
it
is
the
count
sure
enoughâ€
â€œit
is
heâ€
exclaimed
emily
lifting
her
eyes
towards
heaven
and
supporting
herself
by
annetteâ€™s
arm
â€œgood
lord
my
dear
lady
donâ€™t
be
in
such
a
fluster
and
look
so
pale
we
shall
soon
hear
moreâ€
â€œwe
shall
indeedâ€
said
emily
moving
as
fast
as
she
was
able
towards
her
apartment
â€œi
am
not
well
give
me
airâ€
annette
opened
a
casement
and
brought
water
the
faintness
soon
left
emily
but
she
desired
annette
would
not
go
till
she
heard
from
montoni
â€œdear
maâ€™amselle
he
surely
will
not
disturb
you
at
this
time
of
night
why
he
must
think
you
are
asleepâ€
â€œstay
with
me
till
i
am
so
thenâ€
said
emily
who
felt
temporary
relief
from
this
suggestion
which
appeared
probable
enough
though
her
fears
had
prevented
its
occurring
to
her
annette
with
secret
reluctance
consented
to
stay
and
emily
was
now
composed
enough
to
ask
her
some
questions
among
others
whether
she
had
seen
the
count
â€œyes
maâ€™am
i
saw
him
alight
for
i
went
from
hence
to
the
grate
in
the
north
turret
that
overlooks
the
inner
courtyard
you
know
there
i
saw
the
countâ€™s
carriage
and
the
count
in
it
waiting
at
the
great
doorâ€”for
the
porter
was
just
gone
to
bedâ€”with
several
men
on
horseback
all
by
the
light
of
the
torches
they
carriedâ€
emily
was
compelled
to
smile
â€œwhen
the
door
was
opened
the
count
said
something
that
i
could
not
make
out
and
then
got
out
and
another
gentleman
with
him
i
thought
to
be
sure
the
signor
was
gone
to
bed
and
i
hastened
away
to
my
ladyâ€™s
dressing-room
to
see
what
i
could
hear
but
in
the
way
i
met
ludovico
and
he
told
me
that
the
signor
was
up
counselling
with
his
master
and
the
other
signors
in
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
north
gallery
and
ludovico
held
up
his
finger
and
laid
it
on
his
lips
as
much
as
to
sayâ€”there
is
more
going
on
than
you
think
of
annette
but
you
must
hold
your
tongue
and
so
i
did
hold
my
tongue
maâ€™amselle
and
came
away
to
tell
you
directlyâ€
emily
enquired
who
the
cavalier
was
that
accompanied
the
count
and
how
montoni
received
them
but
annette
could
not
inform
her
â€œludovicoâ€
she
added
â€œhad
just
been
to
call
signor
montoniâ€™s
valet
that
he
might
tell
him
they
were
arrived
when
i
met
himâ€
emily
sat
musing
for
some
time
and
then
her
anxiety
was
so
much
increased
that
she
desired
annette
would
go
to
the
servantsâ€™
hall
where
it
was
possible
she
might
hear
something
of
the
countâ€™s
intention
respecting
his
stay
at
the
castle
â€œyes
maâ€™amâ€
said
annette
with
readiness
â€œbut
how
am
i
to
find
the
way
if
i
leave
the
lamp
with
youâ€
emily
said
she
would
light
her
and
they
immediately
quitted
the
chamber
when
they
had
reached
the
top
of
the
great
staircase
emily
recollected
that
she
might
be
seen
by
the
count
and
to
avoid
the
great
hall
annette
conducted
her
through
some
private
passages
to
a
back
staircase
which
led
directly
to
that
of
the
servants
as
she
returned
towards
her
chamber
emily
began
to
fear
that
she
might
again
lose
herself
in
the
intricacies
of
the
castle
and
again
be
shocked
by
some
mysterious
spectacle
and
though
she
was
already
perplexed
by
the
numerous
turnings
she
feared
to
open
one
of
the
many
doors
that
offered
while
she
stepped
thoughtfully
along
she
fancied
that
she
heard
a
low
moaning
at
no
great
distance
and
having
paused
a
moment
she
heard
it
again
and
distinctly
several
doors
appeared
on
the
right
hand
of
the
passage
she
advanced
and
listened
when
she
came
to
the
second
she
heard
a
voice
apparently
in
complaint
within
to
which
she
continued
to
listen
afraid
to
open
the
door
and
unwilling
to
leave
it
convulsive
sobs
followed
and
then
the
piercing
accents
of
an
agonizing
spirit
burst
forth
emily
stood
appalled
and
looked
through
the
gloom
that
surrounded
her
in
fearful
expectation
the
lamentations
continued
pity
now
began
to
subdue
terror
it
was
possible
she
might
administer
comfort
to
the
sufferer
at
least
by
expressing
sympathy
and
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
door
while
she
hesitated
she
thought
she
knew
this
voice
disguised
as
it
was
by
tones
of
grief
having
therefore
set
down
the
lamp
in
the
passage
she
gently
opened
the
door
within
which
all
was
dark
except
that
from
an
inner
apartment
a
partial
light
appeared
and
she
stepped
softly
on
before
she
reached
it
the
appearance
of
madame
montoni
leaning
on
her
dressing-table
weeping
and
with
a
handkerchief
held
to
her
eyes
struck
her
and
she
paused
some
person
was
seated
in
a
chair
by
the
fire
but
who
it
was
she
could
not
distinguish
he
spoke
now
and
then
in
a
low
voice
that
did
not
allow
emily
to
hear
what
was
uttered
but
she
thought
that
madame
montoni
at
those
times
wept
the
more
who
was
too
much
occupied
by
her
own
distress
to
observe
emily
while
the
latter
though
anxious
to
know
what
occasioned
this
and
who
was
the
person
admitted
at
so
late
an
hour
to
her
auntâ€™s
dressing-room
forbore
to
add
to
her
sufferings
by
surprising
her
or
to
take
advantage
of
her
situation
by
listening
to
a
private
discourse
she
therefore
stepped
softly
back
and
after
some
further
difficulty
found
the
way
to
her
own
chamber
where
nearer
interests
at
length
excluded
the
surprise
and
concern
she
had
felt
respecting
madame
montoni
annette
however
returned
without
satisfactory
intelligence
for
the
servants
among
whom
she
had
been
were
either
entirely
ignorant
or
affected
to
be
so
concerning
the
countâ€™s
intended
stay
at
the
castle
they
could
talk
only
of
the
steep
and
broken
road
they
had
just
passed
and
of
the
numerous
dangers
they
had
escaped
and
express
wonder
how
their
lord
could
choose
to
encounter
all
these
in
the
darkness
of
night
for
they
scarcely
allowed
that
the
torches
had
served
for
any
other
purpose
but
that
of
showing
the
dreariness
of
the
mountains
annette
finding
she
could
gain
no
information
left
them
making
noisy
petitions
for
more
wood
on
the
fire
and
more
supper
on
the
table
â€œand
now
maâ€™amselleâ€
added
she
â€œi
am
so
sleepyâ€”i
am
sure
if
you
were
so
sleepy
you
would
not
desire
me
to
sit
up
with
youâ€
emily
indeed
began
to
think
it
was
cruel
to
wish
it
she
had
also
waited
so
long
without
receiving
a
summons
from
montoni
that
it
appeared
he
did
not
mean
to
disturb
her
at
this
late
hour
and
she
determined
to
dismiss
annette
but
when
she
again
looked
round
her
gloomy
chamber
and
recollected
certain
circumstances
fear
seized
her
spirits
and
she
hesitated
â€œand
yet
it
were
cruel
of
me
to
ask
you
to
stay
till
i
am
asleep
annetteâ€
said
she
â€œfor
i
fear
it
will
be
very
long
before
i
forget
myself
in
sleepâ€
â€œi
dare
say
it
will
be
very
long
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œbut
before
you
goâ€
rejoined
emily
â€œlet
me
ask
youâ€”had
signor
montoni
left
count
morano
when
you
quitted
the
hallâ€
â€œo
no
maâ€™am
they
were
alone
togetherâ€
â€œhave
you
been
in
my
auntâ€™s
dressing-room
since
you
left
meâ€
â€œno
maâ€™amselle
i
called
at
the
door
as
i
passed
but
it
was
fastened
so
i
thought
my
lady
was
gone
to
bedâ€
â€œwho
then
was
with
your
lady
just
nowâ€
said
emily
forgetting
in
surprise
her
usual
prudence
â€œnobody
i
believe
maâ€™amâ€
replied
annette
â€œnobody
has
been
with
her
i
believe
since
i
left
youâ€
emily
took
no
further
notice
of
the
subject
and
after
some
struggle
with
imaginary
fears
her
good
nature
prevailed
over
them
so
far
that
she
dismissed
annette
for
the
night
she
then
sat
musing
upon
her
own
circumstances
and
those
of
madame
montoni
till
her
eye
rested
on
the
miniature
picture
which
she
had
found
after
her
fatherâ€™s
death
among
the
papers
he
had
enjoined
her
to
destroy
it
was
open
upon
the
table
before
her
among
some
loose
drawings
having
with
them
been
taken
out
of
a
little
box
by
emily
some
hours
before
the
sight
of
it
called
up
many
interesting
reflections
but
the
melancholy
sweetness
of
the
countenance
soothed
the
emotions
which
these
had
occasioned
it
was
the
same
style
of
countenance
as
that
of
her
late
father
and
while
she
gazed
on
it
with
fondness
on
this
account
she
even
fancied
a
resemblance
in
the
features
but
this
tranquillity
was
suddenly
interrupted
when
she
recollected
the
words
in
the
manuscript
that
had
been
found
with
this
picture
and
which
had
formerly
occasioned
her
so
much
doubt
and
horror
at
length
she
roused
herself
from
the
deep
reverie
into
which
this
remembrance
had
thrown
her
but
when
she
rose
to
undress
the
silence
and
solitude
to
which
she
was
left
at
this
midnight
hour
for
not
even
a
distant
sound
was
now
heard
conspired
with
the
impression
the
subject
she
had
been
considering
had
given
to
her
mind
to
appall
her
annetteâ€™s
hints
too
concerning
this
chamber
simple
as
they
were
had
not
failed
to
affect
her
since
they
followed
a
circumstance
of
peculiar
horror
which
she
herself
had
witnessed
and
since
the
scene
of
this
was
a
chamber
nearly
adjoining
her
own
the
door
of
the
staircase
was
perhaps
a
subject
of
more
reasonable
alarm
and
she
now
began
to
apprehend
such
was
the
aptitude
of
her
fears
that
this
staircase
had
some
private
communication
with
the
apartment
which
she
shuddered
even
to
remember
determined
not
to
undress
she
lay
down
to
sleep
in
her
clothes
with
her
late
fatherâ€™s
dog
the
faithful
manchon
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
whom
she
considered
as
a
kind
of
guard
thus
circumstanced
she
tried
to
banish
reflection
but
her
busy
fancy
would
still
hover
over
the
subjects
of
her
interest
and
she
heard
the
clock
of
the
castle
strike
two
before
she
closed
her
eyes
from
the
disturbed
slumber
into
which
she
then
sunk
she
was
soon
awakened
by
a
noise
which
seemed
to
arise
within
her
chamber
but
the
silence
that
prevailed
as
she
fearfully
listened
inclined
her
to
believe
that
she
had
been
alarmed
by
such
sounds
as
sometimes
occur
in
dreams
and
she
laid
her
head
again
upon
the
pillow
a
return
of
the
noise
again
disturbed
her
it
seemed
to
come
from
that
part
of
the
room
which
communicated
with
the
private
staircase
and
she
instantly
remembered
the
odd
circumstance
of
the
door
having
been
fastened
during
the
preceding
night
by
some
unknown
hand
her
late
alarming
suspicion
concerning
its
communication
also
occurred
to
her
her
heart
became
faint
with
terror
half
raising
herself
from
the
bed
and
gently
drawing
aside
the
curtain
she
looked
towards
the
door
of
the
staircase
but
the
lamp
that
burnt
on
the
hearth
spread
so
feeble
a
light
through
the
apartment
that
the
remote
parts
of
it
were
lost
in
shadow
the
noise
however
which
she
was
convinced
came
from
the
door
continued
it
seemed
like
that
made
by
the
undrawing
of
rusty
bolts
and
often
ceased
and
was
then
renewed
more
gently
as
if
the
hand
that
occasioned
it
was
restrained
by
a
fear
of
discovery
while
emily
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
spot
she
saw
the
door
move
and
then
slowly
open
and
perceived
something
enter
the
room
but
the
extreme
duskiness
prevented
her
distinguishing
what
it
was
almost
fainting
with
terror
she
had
yet
sufficient
command
over
herself
to
check
the
shriek
that
was
escaping
from
her
lips
and
letting
the
curtain
drop
from
her
hand
continued
to
observe
in
silence
the
motions
of
the
mysterious
form
she
saw
it
seemed
to
glide
along
the
remote
obscurity
of
the
apartment
then
paused
and
as
it
approached
the
hearth
she
perceived
in
the
stronger
light
what
appeared
to
be
a
human
figure
certain
remembrances
now
struck
upon
her
heart
and
almost
subdued
the
feeble
remains
of
her
spirits
she
continued
however
to
watch
the
figure
which
remained
for
some
time
motionless
but
then
advancing
slowly
towards
the
bed
stood
silently
at
the
feet
where
the
curtains
being
a
little
open
allowed
her
still
to
see
it
terror
however
had
now
deprived
her
of
the
power
of
discrimination
as
well
as
of
that
of
utterance
having
continued
there
a
moment
the
form
retreated
towards
the
hearth
when
it
took
the
lamp
held
it
up
surveyed
the
chamber
for
a
few
moments
and
then
again
advanced
towards
the
bed
the
light
at
that
instant
awakening
the
dog
that
had
slept
at
emilyâ€™s
feet
he
barked
loudly
and
jumping
to
the
floor
flew
at
the
stranger
who
struck
the
animal
smartly
with
a
sheathed
sword
and
springing
towards
the
bed
emily
discoveredâ€”count
morano
she
gazed
at
him
for
a
moment
in
speechless
affright
while
he
throwing
himself
on
his
knee
at
the
bedside
besought
her
to
fear
nothing
and
having
thrown
down
his
sword
would
have
taken
her
hand
when
the
faculties
that
terror
had
suspended
suddenly
returned
and
she
sprung
from
the
bed
in
the
dress
which
surely
a
kind
of
prophetic
apprehension
had
prevented
her
on
this
night
from
throwing
aside
morano
rose
followed
her
to
the
door
through
which
he
had
entered
and
caught
her
hand
as
she
reached
the
top
of
the
staircase
but
not
before
she
had
discovered
by
the
gleam
of
a
lamp
another
man
half-way
down
the
steps
she
now
screamed
in
despair
and
believing
herself
given
up
by
montoni
saw
indeed
no
possibility
of
escape
the
count
who
still
held
her
hand
led
her
back
into
the
chamber
â€œwhy
all
this
terrorâ€
said
he
in
a
tremulous
voice
â€œhear
me
emily
i
come
not
to
alarm
you
no
by
heaven
i
love
you
too
wellâ€”too
well
for
my
own
peaceâ€
emily
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
in
fearful
doubt
â€œthen
leave
me
sirâ€
said
she
â€œleave
me
instantlyâ€
â€œhear
me
emilyâ€
resumed
morano
â€œhear
me
i
love
and
am
in
despairâ€”yesâ€”in
despair
how
can
i
gaze
upon
you
and
know
that
it
is
perhaps
for
the
last
time
without
suffering
all
the
frenzy
of
despair
but
it
shall
not
be
so
you
shall
be
mine
in
spite
of
montoni
and
all
his
villanyâ€
â€œin
spite
of
montoniâ€
cried
emily
eagerly
â€œwhat
is
it
i
hearâ€
â€œyou
hear
that
montoni
is
a
villainâ€
exclaimed
morano
with
vehemenceâ€”â€œa
villain
who
would
have
sold
you
to
my
loveâ€”whoâ€”â€
â€œand
is
he
less
who
would
have
bought
meâ€
said
emily
fixing
on
the
count
an
eye
of
calm
contempt
â€œleave
the
room
sir
instantlyâ€
she
continued
in
a
voice
trembling
between
joy
and
fear
â€œor
i
will
alarm
the
family
and
you
may
receive
that
from
signor
montoniâ€™s
vengeance
which
i
have
vainly
supplicated
from
his
pityâ€
but
emily
knew
that
she
was
beyond
the
hearing
of
those
who
might
protect
her
â€œyou
can
never
hope
anything
from
his
pityâ€
said
morano
â€œhe
has
used
me
infamously
and
my
vengeance
shall
pursue
him
and
for
you
emily
for
you
he
has
new
plans
more
profitable
than
the
last
no
doubtâ€
the
gleam
of
hope
which
the
countâ€™s
former
speech
had
revived
was
now
nearly
extinguished
by
the
latter
and
while
emilyâ€™s
countenance
betrayed
the
emotions
of
her
mind
he
endeavoured
to
take
advantage
of
the
discovery
â€œi
lose
timeâ€
said
he
â€œi
came
not
to
exclaim
against
montoni
i
came
to
solicit
to
pleadâ€”to
emily
to
tell
her
all
i
suffer
to
entreat
her
to
save
me
from
despair
and
herself
from
destruction
emily
the
schemes
of
montoni
are
insearchable
but
i
warn
you
they
are
terrible
he
has
no
principle
when
interest
or
ambition
leads
can
i
love
you
and
abandon
you
to
his
power
fly
then
fly
from
this
gloomy
prison
with
a
lover
who
adores
you
i
have
bribed
a
servant
of
the
castle
to
open
the
gates
and
before
tomorrowâ€™s
dawn
you
shall
be
far
on
the
way
to
veniceâ€
emily
overcome
by
the
sudden
shock
she
had
received
at
the
moment
too
when
she
had
begun
to
hope
for
better
days
now
thought
she
saw
destruction
surround
her
on
every
side
unable
to
reply
and
almost
to
think
she
threw
herself
into
a
chair
pale
and
breathless
that
montoni
had
formerly
sold
her
to
morano
was
very
probable
that
he
had
now
withdrawn
his
consent
to
the
marriage
was
evident
from
the
countâ€™s
present
conduct
and
it
was
nearly
certain
that
a
scheme
of
stronger
interest
only
could
have
induced
the
selfish
montoni
to
forego
a
plan
which
he
had
hitherto
so
strenuously
pursued
these
reflections
made
her
tremble
at
the
hints
which
morano
had
just
given
which
she
no
longer
hesitated
to
believe
and
while
she
shrunk
from
the
new
scenes
of
misery
and
oppression
that
might
await
her
in
the
castle
of
udolpho
she
was
compelled
to
observe
that
almost
her
only
means
of
escaping
them
was
by
submitting
herself
to
the
protection
of
this
man
with
whom
evils
more
certain
and
not
less
terrible
appearedâ€”evils
upon
which
she
could
not
endure
to
pause
for
an
instant
her
silence
though
it
was
that
of
agony
encouraged
the
hopes
of
morano
who
watched
her
countenance
with
impatience
took
again
the
resisting
hand
she
had
withdrawn
and
as
he
pressed
it
to
his
heart
again
conjured
her
to
determine
immediately
â€œevery
moment
we
lose
will
make
our
departure
more
dangerousâ€
said
he
â€œthese
few
moments
lost
may
enable
montoni
to
overtake
usâ€
â€œi
beseech
you
sir
be
silentâ€
said
emily
faintly
â€œi
am
indeed
very
wretched
and
wretched
i
must
remain
leave
meâ€”i
command
you
leave
me
to
my
fateâ€
â€œneverâ€
cried
the
count
vehemently
â€œlet
me
perish
first
but
forgive
my
violence
the
thought
of
losing
you
is
madness
you
cannot
be
ignorant
of
montoniâ€™s
character
you
may
be
ignorant
of
his
schemesâ€”nay
you
must
be
so
or
you
would
not
hesitate
between
my
love
and
his
powerâ€
â€œnor
do
i
hesitateâ€
said
emily
â€œlet
us
go
thenâ€
said
morano
eagerly
kissing
her
hand
and
rising
â€œmy
carriage
waits
below
the
castle
wallsâ€
â€œyou
mistake
me
sirâ€
said
emily
â€œallow
me
to
thank
you
for
the
interest
you
express
in
my
welfare
and
to
decide
by
my
own
choice
i
shall
remain
under
the
protection
of
signor
montoniâ€
â€œunder
his
protectionâ€
exclaimed
morano
proudly
â€œhis
protection
emily
why
will
you
suffer
yourself
to
be
thus
deluded
i
have
already
told
you
what
you
have
to
expect
from
his
protectionâ€
â€œand
pardon
me
sir
if
in
this
instance
i
doubt
mere
assertion
and
to
be
convinced
require
something
approaching
to
proofâ€
â€œi
have
now
neither
the
time
nor
the
means
of
adducing
proofâ€
replied
the
count
â€œnor
have
i
sir
the
inclination
to
listen
to
it
if
you
hadâ€
â€œbut
you
trifle
with
my
patience
and
my
distressâ€
continued
morano
â€œis
a
marriage
with
a
man
who
adores
you
so
very
terrible
in
your
eyes
that
you
would
prefer
to
it
all
the
misery
to
which
montoni
may
condemn
you
in
this
remote
prison
some
wretch
must
have
stolen
those
affections
which
ought
to
be
mine
or
you
would
not
thus
obstinately
persist
in
refusing
an
offer
that
would
place
you
beyond
the
reach
of
oppressionâ€
morano
walked
about
the
room
with
quick
steps
and
a
disturbed
air
â€œthis
discourse
count
morano
sufficiently
proves
that
my
affections
ought
not
to
be
yoursâ€
said
emily
mildly
â€œand
this
conduct
that
i
should
not
be
placed
beyond
the
reach
of
oppression
so
long
as
i
remained
in
your
power
if
you
wish
me
to
believe
otherwise
cease
to
oppress
me
any
longer
by
your
presence
if
you
refuse
this
you
will
compel
me
to
expose
you
to
the
resentment
of
signor
montoniâ€
â€œyes
let
him
comeâ€
cried
morano
furiously
â€œand
brave
my
resentment
let
him
dare
to
face
once
more
the
man
he
has
so
courageously
injured
danger
shall
teach
him
morality
and
vengeance
justiceâ€”let
him
come
and
receive
my
sword
in
his
heartâ€
the
vehemence
with
which
this
was
uttered
gave
emily
new
cause
of
alarm
who
arose
from
her
chair
but
her
trembling
frame
refused
to
support
her
and
she
resumed
her
seatâ€”the
words
died
on
her
lips
and
when
she
looked
wistfully
towards
the
door
of
the
corridor
which
was
locked
she
considered
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
leave
the
apartment
before
morano
would
be
apprised
of
and
able
to
counteract
her
intention
without
observing
her
agitation
he
continued
to
pace
the
room
in
the
utmost
perturbation
of
spirits
his
darkened
countenance
expressed
all
the
rage
of
jealousy
and
revenge
and
a
person
who
had
seen
his
features
under
the
smile
of
ineffable
tenderness
which
he
so
lately
assumed
would
now
scarcely
have
believed
them
to
be
the
same
â€œcount
moranoâ€
said
emily
at
length
recovering
her
voice
â€œcalm
i
entreat
you
these
transports
and
listen
to
reason
if
you
will
not
to
pity
you
have
equally
misplaced
your
love
and
your
hatredâ€”i
never
could
have
returned
the
affection
with
which
you
honour
me
and
certainly
have
never
encouraged
it
neither
has
signor
montoni
injured
you
for
you
must
have
known
that
he
had
no
right
to
dispose
of
my
hand
had
he
even
possessed
the
power
to
do
so
leave
then
leave
the
castle
while
you
may
with
safety
spare
yourself
the
dreadful
consequences
of
an
unjust
revenge
and
the
remorse
of
having
prolonged
to
me
these
moments
of
sufferingâ€
â€œis
it
for
mine
or
for
montoniâ€™s
safety
that
you
are
thus
alarmedâ€
said
morano
coldly
and
turning
towards
her
with
a
look
of
acrimony
â€œfor
bothâ€
replied
emily
in
a
trembling
voice
â€œunjust
revengeâ€
cried
the
count
resuming
the
abrupt
tones
of
passion
â€œwho
that
looks
upon
that
face
can
imagine
a
punishment
adequate
to
the
injury
he
would
have
done
me
yes
i
will
leave
the
castle
but
it
shall
not
be
alone
i
have
trifled
too
long
since
my
prayers
and
my
sufferings
cannot
prevail
force
shall
i
have
people
in
waiting
who
shall
convey
you
to
my
carriage
your
voice
will
bring
no
succour
it
cannot
be
heard
from
this
remote
part
of
the
castle
submit
therefore
in
silence
to
go
with
meâ€
this
was
an
unnecessary
injunction
at
present
for
emily
was
too
certain
that
her
call
would
avail
her
nothing
and
terror
had
so
entirely
disordered
her
thoughts
that
she
knew
not
how
to
plead
to
morano
but
sat
mute
and
trembling
in
her
chair
till
he
advanced
to
lift
her
from
it
when
she
suddenly
raised
herself
and
with
a
repulsive
gesture
and
a
countenance
of
forced
serenity
said
â€œcount
morano
i
am
now
in
your
power
but
you
will
observe
that
this
is
not
the
conduct
which
can
win
the
esteem
you
appear
so
solicitous
to
obtain
and
that
you
are
preparing
for
yourself
a
load
of
remorse
in
the
miseries
of
a
friendless
orphan
which
can
never
leave
you
do
you
believe
your
heart
to
be
indeed
so
hardened
that
you
can
look
without
emotion
on
the
suffering
to
which
you
would
condemn
meâ€”â€
emily
was
interrupted
by
the
growling
of
the
dog
who
now
came
again
from
the
bed
and
morano
looked
towards
the
door
of
the
staircase
where
no
person
appearing
he
called
aloud
â€œcesarioâ€
â€œemilyâ€
said
the
count
â€œwhy
will
you
reduce
me
to
adopt
this
conduct
how
much
more
willingly
would
i
persuade
than
compel
you
to
become
my
wife
but
by
heaven
i
will
not
leave
you
to
be
sold
by
montoni
yet
a
thought
glances
across
my
mind
that
brings
madness
with
it
i
know
not
how
to
name
it
it
is
preposterousâ€”it
cannot
beâ€”yet
you
trembleâ€”you
grow
pale
it
is
it
is
soâ€”youâ€”youâ€”love
montoniâ€
cried
morano
grasping
emilyâ€™s
wrist
and
stamping
his
foot
on
the
floor
an
involuntary
air
of
surprise
appeared
on
her
countenance
â€œif
you
have
indeed
believed
soâ€
said
she
â€œbelieve
so
stillâ€
â€œthat
look
those
words
confirm
itâ€
exclaimed
morano
furiously
â€œno
no
no
montoni
had
a
richer
prize
in
view
than
gold
but
he
shall
not
live
to
triumph
over
meâ€”this
very
instantâ€”â€
he
was
interrupted
by
the
loud
barking
of
the
dog
â€œstay
count
moranoâ€
said
emily
terrified
by
his
words
and
by
the
fury
expressed
in
his
eyes
â€œi
will
save
you
from
this
errorâ€”of
all
men
signor
montoni
is
not
your
rival
though
if
i
find
all
other
means
of
saving
myself
vain
i
will
try
whether
my
voice
may
not
arouse
his
servants
to
my
succourâ€
â€œassertionâ€
replied
morano
â€œat
such
a
moment
is
not
to
be
depended
upon
how
could
i
suffer
myself
to
doubt
even
for
an
instant
that
he
could
see
you
and
not
loveâ€”but
my
first
care
shall
be
to
convey
you
from
the
castle
cesario
hoâ€”cesarioâ€
a
man
now
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
staircase
and
other
steps
were
heard
ascending
emily
uttered
a
loud
shriek
as
morano
hurried
her
across
the
chamber
and
at
the
same
moment
she
heard
a
noise
at
the
door
that
opened
upon
the
corridor
the
count
paused
an
instant
as
if
his
mind
was
suspended
between
love
and
the
desire
of
vengeance
and
in
that
instant
the
door
gave
way
and
montoni
followed
by
the
old
steward
and
several
other
persons
burst
into
the
room
â€œdrawâ€
cried
montoni
to
the
count
who
did
not
pause
for
a
second
bidding
but
giving
emily
into
the
hands
of
the
people
that
appeared
from
the
staircase
turned
fiercely
round
â€œthis
in
thine
heart
villainâ€
said
he
as
he
made
a
thrust
at
montoni
with
his
sword
who
parried
the
blow
and
aimed
another
while
some
of
the
persons
who
had
followed
him
into
the
room
endeavoured
to
part
the
combatants
and
others
rescued
emily
from
the
hands
of
moranoâ€™s
servants
â€œwas
it
for
this
count
moranoâ€
said
montoni
in
a
cool
sarcastic
tone
of
voice
â€œthat
i
received
you
under
my
roof
and
permitted
you
though
my
declared
enemy
to
remain
under
it
for
the
night
was
it
that
you
might
repay
my
hospitality
with
the
treachery
of
a
fiend
and
rob
me
of
my
nieceâ€
â€œwho
talks
of
treacheryâ€
said
morano
in
a
tone
of
unrestrained
vehemence
â€œlet
him
that
does
show
an
unblushing
face
of
innocence
montoni
you
are
a
villain
if
there
is
treachery
in
this
affair
look
to
yourself
as
the
author
of
it
ifâ€”do
i
say
iâ€”whom
you
have
wronged
with
unexampled
baseness
whom
you
have
injured
almost
beyond
redress
but
why
do
i
use
wordsâ€”come
on
coward
and
receive
justice
at
my
handsâ€
â€œcowardâ€
cried
montoni
bursting
from
the
people
who
held
him
and
rushing
on
the
count
when
they
both
retreated
into
the
corridor
where
the
fight
continued
so
desperately
that
none
of
the
spectators
dared
approach
them
montoni
swearing
that
the
first
who
interfered
should
fall
by
his
sword
jealousy
and
revenge
lent
all
their
fury
to
morano
while
the
superior
skill
and
the
temperance
of
montoni
enabled
him
to
wound
his
adversary
whom
his
servants
now
attempted
to
seize
but
he
would
not
be
restrained
and
regardless
of
his
wound
continued
to
fight
he
seemed
to
be
insensible
both
of
pain
and
loss
of
blood
and
alive
only
to
the
energy
of
his
passions
montoni
on
the
contrary
persevered
in
the
combat
with
a
fierce
yet
wary
valour
he
received
the
point
of
moranoâ€™s
sword
on
his
arm
but
almost
in
the
same
instant
severely
wounded
and
disarmed
him
the
count
then
fell
back
into
the
arms
of
his
servant
while
montoni
held
his
sword
over
him
and
bade
him
ask
his
life
morano
sinking
under
the
anguish
of
his
wound
had
scarcely
replied
by
a
gesture
and
by
a
few
words
feebly
articulated
that
he
would
notâ€”when
he
fainted
and
montoni
was
then
going
to
have
plunged
the
sword
into
his
breast
as
he
lay
senseless
but
his
arm
was
arrested
by
cavigni
to
the
interruption
he
yielded
without
much
difficulty
but
his
complexion
changed
almost
to
blackness
as
he
looked
upon
his
fallen
adversary
and
ordered
that
he
should
be
carried
instantly
from
the
castle
in
the
mean
time
emily
who
had
been
withheld
from
leaving
the
chamber
during
the
affray
now
came
forward
into
the
corridor
and
pleaded
a
cause
of
common
humanity
with
the
feelings
of
the
warmest
benevolence
when
she
entreated
montoni
to
allow
morano
the
assistance
in
the
castle
which
his
situation
required
but
montoni
who
had
seldom
listened
to
pity
now
seemed
rapacious
of
vengeance
and
with
a
monsterâ€™s
cruelty
again
ordered
his
defeated
enemy
to
be
taken
from
the
castle
in
his
present
state
though
there
were
only
the
woods
or
a
solitary
neighbouring
cottage
to
shelter
him
from
the
night
the
countâ€™s
servants
having
declared
that
they
would
not
move
him
till
he
revived
montoniâ€™s
stood
inactive
cavigni
remonstrating
and
emily
superior
to
montoniâ€™s
menaces
giving
water
to
morano
and
directing
the
attendants
to
bind
up
his
wound
at
length
montoni
had
leisure
to
feel
pain
from
his
own
hurt
and
he
withdrew
to
examine
it
the
count
meanwhile
having
slowly
recovered
the
first
object
he
saw
on
raising
his
eyes
was
emily
bending
over
him
with
a
countenance
strongly
expressive
of
solicitude
he
surveyed
her
with
a
look
of
anguish
â€œi
have
deserved
thisâ€
said
he
â€œbut
not
from
montoni
it
is
from
you
emily
that
i
have
deserved
punishment
yet
i
receive
only
pityâ€
he
paused
for
he
had
spoken
with
difficulty
after
a
moment
he
proceeded
â€œi
must
resign
you
but
not
to
montoni
forgive
me
the
sufferings
i
have
already
occasioned
you
but
for
that
villainâ€”his
infamy
shall
not
go
unpunished
carry
me
from
this
placeâ€
said
he
to
his
servants
â€œi
am
in
no
condition
to
travel
you
must
therefore
take
me
to
the
nearest
cottage
for
i
will
not
pass
the
night
under
his
roof
although
i
may
expire
on
the
way
from
itâ€
cesario
proposed
to
go
out
and
enquire
for
a
cottage
that
might
receive
his
master
before
he
attempted
to
remove
him
but
morano
was
impatient
to
be
gone
the
anguish
of
his
mind
seemed
to
be
even
greater
than
that
of
his
wound
and
he
rejected
with
disdain
the
offer
of
cavigni
to
entreat
montoni
that
he
might
be
suffered
to
pass
the
night
in
the
castle
cesario
was
now
going
to
call
up
the
carriage
to
the
great
gate
but
the
count
forbade
him
â€œi
cannot
bear
the
motion
of
a
carriageâ€
said
he
â€œcall
some
others
of
my
people
that
they
may
assist
in
bearing
me
in
their
armsâ€
at
length
however
morano
submitted
to
reason
and
consented
that
cesario
should
first
prepare
some
cottage
to
receive
him
emily
now
that
he
had
recovered
his
senses
was
about
to
withdraw
from
the
corridor
when
a
message
from
montoni
commanded
her
to
do
so
and
also
that
the
count
if
he
was
not
already
gone
should
quit
the
castle
immediately
indignation
flashed
from
moranoâ€™s
eyes
and
flushed
his
cheeks
â€œtell
montoniâ€
said
he
â€œthat
i
shall
go
when
it
suits
my
own
convenience
that
i
quit
the
castle
he
dares
to
call
his
as
i
would
the
nest
of
a
serpent
and
that
this
is
not
the
last
he
shall
hear
from
me
tell
him
i
will
not
leave
another
murder
on
his
conscience
if
i
can
help
itâ€
â€œcount
morano
do
you
know
what
you
sayâ€
said
cavigni
â€œyes
signor
i
know
well
what
i
say
and
he
will
understand
well
what
i
mean
his
conscience
will
assist
his
understanding
on
this
occasionâ€
â€œcount
moranoâ€
said
verezzi
who
had
hitherto
silently
observed
him
â€œdare
again
to
insult
my
friend
and
i
will
plunge
this
sword
in
your
bodyâ€
â€œit
would
be
an
action
worthy
the
friend
of
a
villainâ€
said
morano
as
the
strong
impulse
of
his
indignation
enabled
him
to
raise
himself
from
the
arms
of
his
servants
but
the
energy
was
momentary
and
he
sunk
back
exhausted
by
the
effort
montoniâ€™s
people
meanwhile
held
verezzi
who
seemed
inclined
even
in
this
instant
to
execute
his
threat
and
cavigni
who
was
not
so
depraved
as
to
abet
the
cowardly
malignity
of
verezzi
endeavoured
to
withdraw
him
from
the
corridor
and
emily
whom
a
compassionate
interest
had
thus
long
detained
was
now
quitting
it
in
new
terror
when
the
supplicating
voice
of
morano
arrested
her
and
by
a
feeble
gesture
he
beckoned
her
to
draw
nearer
she
advanced
with
timid
steps
but
the
fainting
languor
of
his
countenance
again
awakened
her
pity
and
overcame
her
terror
â€œi
am
going
from
hence
for
everâ€
said
he
â€œperhaps
i
shall
never
see
you
again
i
would
carry
with
me
your
forgiveness
emily
nay
moreâ€”i
would
also
carry
your
good
wishesâ€
â€œyou
have
my
forgiveness
thenâ€
said
emily
â€œand
my
sincere
wishes
for
your
recoveryâ€
â€œand
only
for
my
recoveryâ€
said
morano
with
a
sigh
â€œfor
your
general
welfareâ€
added
emily
â€œperhaps
i
ought
to
be
contented
with
thisâ€
he
resumed
â€œi
certainly
have
not
deserved
more
but
i
would
ask
you
emily
sometimes
to
think
of
me
and
forgetting
my
offence
to
remember
only
the
passion
which
occasioned
it
i
would
ask
alas
impossibilities
i
would
ask
you
to
love
me
at
this
moment
when
i
am
about
to
part
with
you
and
that
perhaps
for
ever
i
am
scarcely
myself
emilyâ€”may
you
never
know
the
torture
of
a
passion
like
mine
what
do
i
say
o
that
for
me
you
might
be
sensible
of
such
a
passionâ€
emily
looked
impatient
to
be
gone
â€œi
entreat
you
count
to
consult
your
own
safetyâ€
said
she
â€œand
linger
here
no
longer
i
tremble
for
the
consequences
of
signor
verezziâ€™s
passion
and
of
montoniâ€™s
resentment
should
he
learn
that
you
are
still
hereâ€
moranoâ€™s
face
was
overspread
with
a
momentary
crimson
his
eyes
sparkled
but
he
seemed
endeavouring
to
conquer
his
emotion
and
replied
in
a
calm
voice
â€œsince
you
are
interested
for
my
safety
i
will
regard
it
and
be
gone
but
before
i
go
let
me
again
hear
you
say
that
you
wish
me
wellâ€
said
he
fixing
on
her
an
earnest
and
mournful
look
emily
repeated
her
assurances
he
took
her
hand
which
she
scarcely
attempted
to
withdraw
and
put
it
to
his
lips
â€œfarewell
count
moranoâ€
said
emily
and
she
turned
to
go
when
a
second
message
arrived
from
montoni
and
she
again
conjured
morano
as
he
valued
his
life
to
quit
the
castle
immediately
he
regarded
her
in
silence
with
a
look
of
fixed
despair
but
she
had
no
time
to
enforce
her
compassionate
entreaties
and
not
daring
to
disobey
the
second
command
of
montoni
she
left
the
corridor
to
attend
him
he
was
in
the
cedar
parlour
that
adjoined
the
great
hall
laid
upon
a
couch
and
suffering
a
degree
of
anguish
from
his
wound
which
few
persons
could
have
disguised
as
he
did
his
countenance
which
was
stern
but
calm
expressed
the
dark
passion
of
revenge
but
no
symptom
of
pain
bodily
pain
indeed
he
had
always
despised
and
had
yielded
only
to
the
strong
and
terrible
energies
of
the
soul
he
was
attended
by
old
carlo
and
by
signor
bertolini
but
madame
montoni
was
not
with
him
emily
trembled
as
she
approached
and
received
his
severe
rebuke
for
not
having
obeyed
his
first
summons
and
perceived
also
that
he
attributed
her
stay
in
the
corridor
to
a
motive
that
had
not
even
occurred
to
her
artless
mind
â€œthis
is
an
instance
of
female
capriceâ€
said
he
â€œwhich
i
ought
to
have
foreseen
count
morano
whose
suit
you
obstinately
rejected
so
long
as
it
was
countenanced
by
me
you
favour
it
seems
since
you
find
i
have
dismissed
himâ€
emily
looked
astonished
â€œi
do
not
comprehend
you
sirâ€
said
she
â€œyou
certainly
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
the
design
of
the
count
to
visit
the
double-chamber
was
founded
upon
any
approbation
of
mineâ€
â€œto
that
i
reply
nothingâ€
said
montoni
â€œbut
it
must
certainly
be
a
more
than
common
interest
that
made
you
plead
so
warmly
in
his
cause
and
that
could
detain
you
thus
long
in
his
presence
contrary
to
my
express
orderâ€”in
the
presence
of
a
man
whom
you
have
hitherto
on
all
occasions
most
scrupulously
shunnedâ€
â€œi
fear
sir
it
was
a
more
than
common
interest
that
detained
meâ€
said
emily
calmly
â€œfor
of
late
i
have
been
inclined
to
think
that
of
compassion
is
an
uncommon
one
but
how
could
i
could
you
sir
witness
count
moranoâ€™s
deplorable
condition
and
not
wish
to
relieve
itâ€
â€œyou
add
hypocrisy
to
capriceâ€
said
montoni
frowning
â€œand
an
attempt
at
satire
to
both
but
before
you
undertake
to
regulate
the
morals
of
other
persons
you
should
learn
and
practise
the
virtues
which
are
indispensable
to
a
womanâ€”sincerity
uniformity
of
conduct
and
obedienceâ€
emily
who
had
always
endeavoured
to
regulate
her
conduct
by
the
nicest
laws
and
whose
mind
was
finely
sensible
not
only
of
what
is
just
in
morals
but
of
whatever
is
beautiful
in
the
female
character
was
shocked
by
these
words
yet
in
the
next
moment
her
heart
swelled
with
the
consciousness
of
having
deserved
praise
instead
of
censure
and
she
was
proudly
silent
montoni
acquainted
with
the
delicacy
of
her
mind
knew
how
keenly
she
would
feel
his
rebuke
but
he
was
a
stranger
to
the
luxury
of
conscious
worth
and
therefore
did
not
foresee
the
energy
of
that
sentiment
which
now
repelled
his
satire
turning
to
a
servant
who
had
lately
entered
the
room
he
asked
whether
morano
had
quitted
the
castle
the
man
answered
that
his
servants
were
then
removing
him
on
a
couch
to
a
neighbouring
cottage
montoni
seemed
somewhat
appeased
on
hearing
this
and
when
ludovico
appeared
a
few
moments
after
and
said
that
morano
was
gone
he
told
emily
she
might
retire
to
her
apartment
she
withdrew
willingly
from
his
presence
but
the
thought
of
passing
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
a
chamber
which
the
door
from
the
staircase
made
liable
to
the
intrusion
of
any
person
now
alarmed
her
more
than
ever
and
she
determined
to
call
at
madame
montoniâ€™s
room
and
request
that
annette
might
be
permitted
to
be
with
her
on
reaching
the
great
gallery
she
heard
voices
seemingly
in
dispute
and
her
spirits
now
apt
to
take
alarm
she
paused
but
soon
distinguished
some
words
of
cavigni
and
verezzi
and
went
towards
them
in
the
hope
of
conciliating
their
difference
they
were
alone
verezziâ€™s
face
was
still
flushed
with
rage
and
as
the
first
object
of
it
was
now
removed
from
him
he
appeared
willing
to
transfer
his
resentment
to
cavigni
who
seemed
to
be
expostulating
rather
than
disputing
with
him
verezzi
was
protesting
that
he
would
instantly
inform
montoni
of
the
insult
which
morano
had
thrown
out
against
him
and
above
all
that
wherein
he
had
accused
him
of
murder
â€œthere
is
no
answeringâ€
said
cavigni
â€œfor
the
words
of
a
man
in
a
passion
little
serious
regard
ought
to
be
paid
to
them
if
you
persist
in
your
resolution
the
consequences
may
be
fatal
to
both
we
have
now
more
serious
interests
to
pursue
than
those
of
a
petty
revengeâ€
emily
joined
her
entreaties
to
cavigniâ€™s
arguments
and
they
at
length
prevailed
so
far
as
that
verezzi
consented
to
retire
without
seeing
montoni
on
calling
at
her
auntâ€™s
apartment
she
found
it
fastened
in
a
few
minutes
however
it
was
opened
by
madame
montoni
herself
it
may
be
remembered
that
it
was
by
a
door
leading
into
the
bedroom
from
a
back
passage
that
emily
had
secretly
entered
a
few
hours
preceding
she
now
conjectured
by
the
calmness
of
madame
montoniâ€™s
air
that
she
was
not
apprised
of
the
accident
which
had
befallen
her
husband
and
was
beginning
to
inform
her
of
it
in
the
tenderest
manner
she
could
when
her
aunt
interrupted
her
by
saying
she
was
acquainted
with
the
whole
affair
emily
knew
indeed
that
she
had
little
reason
to
love
montoni
but
could
scarcely
have
believed
her
capable
of
such
perfect
apathy
as
she
now
discovered
towards
him
having
obtained
permission
however
for
annette
to
sleep
in
her
chamber
she
went
thither
immediately
a
track
of
blood
appeared
along
the
corridor
leading
to
it
and
on
the
spot
where
the
count
and
montoni
had
fought
the
whole
floor
was
stained
emily
shuddered
and
leaned
on
annette
as
she
passed
when
she
reached
her
apartment
she
instantly
determined
since
the
door
of
the
staircase
had
been
left
open
and
that
annette
was
now
with
her
to
explore
whither
it
ledâ€”a
circumstance
now
materially
connected
with
her
own
safety
annette
accordingly
half
curious
and
half
afraid
proposed
to
descend
the
stairs
but
on
approaching
the
door
they
perceived
that
it
was
already
fastened
without
and
their
care
was
then
directed
to
the
securing
it
on
the
inside
also
by
placing
against
it
as
much
of
the
heavy
furniture
of
the
room
as
they
could
lift
emily
then
retired
to
bed
and
annette
continued
on
a
chair
by
the
hearth
where
some
feeble
embers
remained
of
aery
tongues
that
syllable
menâ€™s
names
on
sands
and
shores
and
desert
wildernesses
milton
it
is
now
necessary
to
mention
some
circumstances
which
could
not
be
related
amidst
the
events
of
emilyâ€™s
hasty
departure
from
venice
or
together
with
those
which
so
rapidly
succeeded
to
her
arrival
in
the
castle
on
the
morning
of
her
journey
count
morano
had
gone
at
the
appointed
hour
to
the
mansion
of
montoni
to
demand
his
bride
when
he
reached
it
he
was
somewhat
surprised
by
the
silence
and
solitary
air
of
the
portico
where
montoniâ€™s
lacqueys
usually
loitered
but
surprise
was
soon
changed
to
astonishment
and
astonishment
to
the
rage
of
disappointment
when
the
door
was
opened
by
an
old
woman
who
told
his
servants
that
her
master
and
his
family
had
left
venice
early
in
the
morning
for
terra-firma
scarcely
believing
what
his
servants
told
he
left
his
gondola
and
rushed
into
the
hall
to
enquire
further
the
old
woman
who
was
the
only
person
left
in
care
of
the
mansion
persisted
in
her
story
which
the
silent
and
deserted
apartments
soon
convinced
him
was
no
fiction
he
then
seized
her
with
a
menacing
air
as
if
he
meant
to
wreak
all
his
vengeance
upon
her
at
the
same
time
asking
her
twenty
questions
in
a
breath
and
all
these
with
a
gesticulation
so
furious
that
she
was
deprived
of
the
power
of
answering
them
then
suddenly
letting
her
go
he
stamped
about
the
hall
like
a
madman
cursing
montoni
and
his
own
folly
when
the
good
woman
was
at
liberty
and
had
somewhat
recovered
from
her
fright
she
told
him
all
she
knew
of
the
affair
which
was
indeed
very
little
but
enough
to
enable
morano
to
discover
that
montoni
was
gone
to
his
castle
on
the
apennine
thither
he
followed
as
soon
as
his
servants
could
complete
the
necessary
preparation
for
the
journey
accompanied
by
a
friend
and
attended
by
a
number
of
his
people
determined
to
obtain
emily
or
a
full
revenge
on
montoni
when
his
mind
had
recovered
from
the
first
effervescence
of
rage
and
his
thoughts
became
less
obscured
his
conscience
hinted
to
him
certain
circumstances
which
in
some
measure
explained
the
conduct
of
montoni
but
how
the
latter
could
have
been
led
to
suspect
an
intention
which
he
had
believed
was
known
only
to
himself
he
could
not
even
guess
on
this
occasion
however
he
had
been
partly
betrayed
by
that
sympathetic
intelligence
which
may
be
said
to
exist
between
bad
minds
and
which
teaches
one
man
to
judge
what
another
will
do
in
the
same
circumstances
thus
it
was
with
montoni
who
had
now
received
indisputable
proof
of
a
truth
which
he
had
some
time
suspectedâ€”that
moranoâ€™s
circumstances
instead
of
being
affluent
as
he
had
been
bidden
to
believe
were
greatly
involved
montoni
had
been
interested
in
his
suit
by
motives
entirely
selfish
those
of
avarice
and
pride
the
last
of
which
would
have
been
gratified
by
an
alliance
with
a
venetian
nobleman
the
former
by
emilyâ€™s
estate
in
gascony
which
he
had
stipulated
as
the
price
of
his
favour
should
be
delivered
up
to
him
from
the
day
of
her
marriage
in
the
meantime
he
had
been
led
to
suspect
the
consequence
of
the
countâ€™s
boundless
extravagance
but
it
was
not
till
the
evening
preceding
the
intended
nuptials
that
he
obtained
certain
information
of
his
distressed
circumstances
he
did
not
hesitate
then
to
infer
that
morano
designed
to
defraud
him
of
emilyâ€™s
estate
and
in
this
supposition
he
was
confirmed
and
with
apparent
reason
by
the
subsequent
conduct
of
the
count
who
after
having
appointed
to
meet
him
on
that
night
for
the
purpose
of
signing
the
instrument
which
was
to
secure
to
him
his
reward
failed
in
his
engagement
such
a
circumstance
indeed
in
a
man
of
moranoâ€™s
gay
and
thoughtless
character
and
at
a
time
when
his
mind
was
engaged
by
the
bustle
of
preparation
for
his
nuptials
might
have
been
attributed
to
a
cause
less
decisive
than
design
but
montoni
did
not
hesitate
an
instant
to
interpret
it
his
own
way
and
after
vainly
waiting
the
countâ€™s
arrival
for
several
hours
he
gave
orders
for
his
people
to
be
in
readiness
to
set
off
at
a
momentâ€™s
notice
by
hastening
to
udolpho
he
intended
to
remove
emily
from
the
reach
of
morano
as
well
as
to
break
off
the
affair
without
submitting
himself
to
useless
altercation
and
if
the
count
meant
what
he
called
honourably
he
would
doubtless
follow
emily
and
sign
the
writings
in
question
if
this
was
done
so
little
consideration
had
montoni
for
her
welfare
that
he
would
not
have
scrupled
to
sacrifice
her
to
a
man
of
ruined
fortune
since
by
that
means
he
could
enrich
himself
and
he
forbore
to
mention
to
her
the
motive
of
his
sudden
journey
lest
the
hope
it
might
revive
should
render
her
more
intractable
when
submission
would
be
required
with
these
considerations
he
had
left
venice
and
with
others
totally
different
morano
had
soon
after
pursued
his
steps
across
the
rugged
apennines
when
his
arrival
was
announced
at
the
castle
montoni
did
not
believe
that
he
would
have
presumed
to
show
himself
unless
he
had
meant
to
fulfil
his
engagement
and
he
therefore
readily
admitted
him
but
the
enraged
countenance
and
expressions
of
morano
as
he
entered
the
apartment
instantly
undeceived
him
and
when
montoni
had
explained
in
part
the
motives
of
his
abrupt
departure
from
venice
the
count
still
persisted
in
demanding
emily
and
reproaching
montoni
without
even
naming
the
former
stipulation
montoni
at
length
weary
of
the
dispute
deferred
the
settling
of
it
till
the
morrow
and
morano
retired
with
some
hope
suggested
by
montoniâ€™s
apparent
indecision
when
however
in
the
silence
of
his
own
apartment
he
began
to
consider
the
past
conversation
the
character
of
montoni
and
some
former
instances
of
his
duplicity
the
hope
which
he
had
admitted
vanished
and
he
determined
not
to
neglect
the
present
possibility
of
obtaining
emily
by
other
means
to
his
confidential
valet
he
told
his
design
of
carrying
away
emily
and
sent
him
back
to
montoniâ€™s
servants
to
find
out
one
among
them
who
might
enable
him
to
execute
it
the
choice
of
this
person
he
entrusted
to
the
fellowâ€™s
own
discernment
and
not
imprudently
for
he
discovered
a
man
whom
montoni
had
on
some
former
occasion
treated
harshly
and
who
was
now
ready
to
betray
him
this
man
conducted
cesario
round
the
castle
through
a
private
passage
to
the
staircase
that
led
to
emilyâ€™s
chamber
then
showed
him
a
short
way
out
of
the
building
and
afterwards
procured
him
the
keys
that
would
secure
his
retreat
the
man
was
well
rewarded
for
his
trouble
how
the
count
was
rewarded
for
his
treachery
had
already
appeared
meanwhile
old
carlo
had
overheard
two
of
moranoâ€™s
servants
who
had
been
ordered
to
be
in
waiting
with
the
carriage
beyond
the
castle
walls
expressing
their
surprise
at
their
masterâ€™s
sudden
and
secret
departure
for
the
valet
had
entrusted
them
with
no
more
of
moranoâ€™s
designs
than
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
execute
they
however
indulged
themselves
in
surmises
and
in
expressing
them
to
each
other
and
from
these
carlo
had
drawn
a
just
conclusion
but
before
he
ventured
to
disclose
his
apprehensions
to
montoni
he
endeavoured
to
obtain
further
confirmation
of
them
and
for
this
purpose
placed
himself
with
one
of
his
fellow-servants
at
the
door
of
emilyâ€™s
apartment
that
opened
upon
the
corridor
he
did
not
watch
long
in
vain
though
the
growling
of
the
dog
had
once
nearly
betrayed
him
when
he
was
convinced
that
morano
was
in
the
room
and
had
listened
long
enough
to
his
conversation
to
understand
his
scheme
he
immediately
alarmed
montoni
and
thus
rescued
emily
from
the
designs
of
the
count
montoni
on
the
following
morning
appeared
as
usual
except
that
he
wore
his
wounded
arm
in
a
sling
he
went
out
upon
the
ramparts
overlooked
the
men
employed
in
repairing
them
gave
orders
for
additional
workmen
and
then
came
into
the
castle
to
give
audience
to
several
persons
who
were
just
arrived
and
who
were
shown
into
a
private
apartment
where
he
communicated
with
them
for
near
an
hour
carlo
was
then
summoned
and
ordered
to
conduct
the
strangers
to
a
part
of
the
castle
which
in
former
times
had
been
occupied
by
the
upper
servants
of
the
family
and
to
provide
them
with
every
necessary
refreshmentâ€”when
he
had
done
this
he
was
bidden
to
return
to
his
master
meanwhile
the
count
remained
in
a
cottage
in
the
skirts
of
the
woods
below
suffering
under
bodily
and
mental
pain
and
meditating
deep
revenge
against
montoni
his
servant
whom
he
had
dispatched
for
a
surgeon
to
the
nearest
town
which
was
however
at
a
considerable
distance
did
not
return
till
the
following
day
when
his
wounds
being
examined
and
dressed
the
practitioner
refused
to
deliver
any
positive
opinion
concerning
the
degree
of
danger
attending
them
but
giving
his
patient
a
composing
draught
and
ordering
him
to
be
quiet
remained
at
the
cottage
to
watch
the
event
emily
for
the
remainder
of
the
late
eventful
night
had
been
suffered
to
sleep
undisturbed
and
when
her
mind
recovered
from
the
confusion
of
slumber
and
she
remembered
that
she
was
now
released
from
the
addresses
of
count
morano
her
spirits
were
suddenly
relieved
from
a
part
of
the
terrible
anxiety
that
had
long
oppressed
them
that
which
remained
arose
chiefly
from
a
recollection
of
moranoâ€™s
assertions
concerning
the
schemes
of
montoni
he
had
said
that
plans
of
the
latter
concerning
emily
were
insearchable
yet
that
he
knew
them
to
be
terrible
at
the
time
he
uttered
this
she
almost
believed
it
to
be
designed
for
the
purpose
of
prevailing
with
her
to
throw
herself
into
his
protection
and
she
still
thought
it
might
be
chiefly
so
accounted
for
but
his
assertions
had
left
an
impression
on
her
mind
which
a
consideration
of
the
character
and
former
conduct
of
montoni
did
not
contribute
to
efface
she
however
checked
her
propensity
to
anticipate
evil
and
determined
to
enjoy
this
respite
from
actual
misfortune
tried
to
dismiss
thought
took
her
instruments
for
drawing
and
placed
herself
at
a
window
to
select
into
a
landscape
some
features
of
the
scenery
without
as
she
was
thus
employed
she
saw
walking
on
the
rampart
below
the
men
who
had
so
lately
arrived
at
the
castle
the
sight
of
strangers
surprised
her
but
still
more
of
strangers
such
as
these
there
was
a
singularity
in
their
dress
and
a
certain
fierceness
in
their
air
that
fixed
all
her
attention
she
withdrew
from
the
casement
while
they
passed
but
soon
returned
to
observe
them
further
their
figures
seemed
so
well
suited
to
the
wildness
of
the
surrounding
objects
that
as
they
stood
surveying
the
castle
she
sketched
them
for
banditti
amid
the
mountain-view
of
her
picture
when
she
had
finished
which
she
was
surprised
to
observe
the
spirit
of
her
group
but
she
had
copied
from
nature
carlo
when
he
had
placed
refreshment
before
these
men
in
the
apartment
assigned
to
them
returned
as
he
was
ordered
to
montoni
who
was
anxious
to
discover
by
what
servant
the
keys
of
the
castle
had
been
delivered
to
morano
on
the
preceding
night
but
this
man
though
he
was
too
faithful
to
his
master
quietly
to
see
him
injured
would
not
betray
a
fellow-servant
even
to
justice
he
therefore
pretended
to
be
ignorant
who
it
was
that
had
conspired
with
count
morano
and
related
as
before
that
he
had
only
overheard
some
of
the
strangers
describing
the
plot
montoniâ€™s
suspicions
naturally
fell
upon
the
porter
whom
he
ordered
now
to
attend
carlo
hesitated
and
then
with
slow
steps
went
to
seek
him
barnardine
the
porter
denied
the
accusation
with
a
countenance
so
steady
and
undaunted
that
montoni
could
scarcely
believe
him
guilty
though
he
knew
not
how
to
think
him
innocent
at
length
the
man
was
dismissed
from
his
presence
and
though
the
real
offender
escaped
detection
montoni
then
went
to
his
wifeâ€™s
apartment
whither
emily
followed
soon
after
but
finding
them
in
high
dispute
was
instantly
leaving
the
room
when
her
aunt
called
her
back
and
desired
her
to
stayâ€”â€œyou
shall
be
a
witnessâ€
said
she
â€œof
my
opposition
now
sir
repeat
the
command
i
have
so
often
refused
to
obeyâ€
montoni
turned
with
a
stern
countenance
to
emily
and
bade
her
quit
the
apartment
while
his
wife
persisted
in
desiring
that
she
would
stay
emily
was
eager
to
escape
from
this
scene
of
contention
and
anxious
also
to
serve
her
aunt
but
she
despaired
of
conciliating
montoni
in
whose
eyes
the
rising
tempest
of
his
soul
flashed
terribly
â€œleave
the
roomâ€
said
he
in
a
voice
of
thunder
emily
obeyed
and
walking
down
to
the
rampart
which
the
strangers
had
now
left
continued
to
meditate
on
the
unhappy
marriage
of
her
fatherâ€™s
sister
and
on
her
own
desolate
situation
occasioned
by
the
ridiculous
imprudence
of
her
whom
she
had
always
wished
to
respect
and
love
madame
montoniâ€™s
conduct
had
indeed
rendered
it
impossible
for
emily
to
do
either
but
her
gentle
heart
was
touched
by
her
distress
and
in
the
pity
thus
awakened
she
forgot
the
injurious
treatment
she
had
received
from
her
as
she
sauntered
on
the
rampart
annette
appeared
at
the
hall
door
looked
cautiously
round
and
then
advanced
to
meet
her
â€œdear
maâ€™amselle
i
have
been
looking
for
you
all
over
the
castleâ€
said
she
â€œif
you
will
step
this
way
i
will
show
you
a
pictureâ€
â€œa
pictureâ€
exclaimed
emily
and
shuddered
â€œyes
maâ€™am
a
picture
of
the
late
lady
of
this
place
old
carlo
just
now
told
me
it
was
her
and
i
thought
you
would
be
curious
to
see
it
as
to
my
lady
you
know
maâ€™amselle
one
cannot
talk
about
such
things
to
herâ€
â€œand
soâ€
said
emily
smilingly
â€œas
you
must
talk
of
them
to
somebodyâ€”â€
â€œwhy
yes
maâ€™amselle
what
can
one
do
in
such
a
place
as
this
if
one
must
not
talk
if
i
was
in
a
dungeon
if
they
would
let
me
talkâ€”it
would
be
some
comfort
nay
i
would
talk
if
it
was
only
to
the
walls
but
come
maâ€™amselle
we
lose
timeâ€”let
me
show
you
the
pictureâ€
â€œis
it
veiledâ€
said
emily
pausing
â€œdear
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
fixing
her
eyes
on
emilyâ€™s
face
â€œwhat
makes
you
look
so
paleâ€”are
you
illâ€
â€œno
annette
i
am
well
enough
but
i
have
no
desire
to
see
this
picture
return
into
the
hallâ€
â€œwhat
maâ€™am
not
to
see
the
lady
of
this
castleâ€
said
the
girl
â€œthe
lady
who
disappeared
to
strangely
well
now
i
would
have
run
to
the
furthest
mountain
we
can
see
yonder
to
have
got
a
sight
of
such
a
picture
and
to
speak
my
mind
that
strange
story
is
all
that
makes
me
care
about
this
old
castle
though
it
makes
me
thrill
all
over
as
it
were
whenever
i
think
of
itâ€
â€œyes
annette
you
love
the
wonderful
but
do
you
know
that
unless
you
guard
against
this
inclination
it
will
lead
you
into
all
the
misery
of
superstitionâ€
annette
might
have
smiled
in
her
turn
at
this
sage
observation
of
emily
who
could
tremble
with
ideal
terrors
as
much
as
herself
and
listen
almost
as
eagerly
to
the
recital
of
a
mysterious
story
annette
urged
her
request
â€œare
you
sure
it
is
a
pictureâ€
said
emily
â€œhave
you
seen
itâ€”is
it
veiledâ€
â€œholy
maria
maâ€™amselle
yes
no
yes
i
am
sure
it
is
a
pictureâ€”i
have
seen
it
and
it
is
not
veiledâ€
the
tone
and
look
of
surprise
with
which
this
was
uttered
recalled
emilyâ€™s
prudence
who
concealed
her
emotion
under
a
smile
and
bade
annette
lead
her
to
the
picture
it
was
in
an
obscure
chamber
adjoining
that
part
of
the
castle
allotted
to
the
servants
several
other
portraits
hung
on
the
walls
covered
like
this
with
dust
and
cobweb
â€œthat
is
it
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
in
a
low
voice
and
pointing
emily
advanced
and
surveyed
the
picture
it
represented
a
lady
in
the
flower
of
youth
and
beauty
her
features
were
handsome
and
noble
full
of
strong
expression
but
had
little
of
the
captivating
sweetness
that
emily
had
looked
for
and
still
less
of
the
pensive
mildness
she
loved
it
was
a
countenance
which
spoke
the
language
of
passion
rather
than
that
of
sentiment
a
haughty
impatience
of
misfortuneâ€”not
the
placid
melancholy
of
a
spirit
injured
yet
resigned
â€œhow
many
years
have
passed
since
this
lady
disappeared
annetteâ€
said
emily
â€œtwenty
years
maâ€™amselle
or
thereabout
as
they
tell
me
i
know
it
is
a
long
while
agoâ€
emily
continued
to
gaze
upon
the
portrait
â€œi
thinkâ€
resumed
annette
â€œthe
signor
would
do
well
to
hang
it
in
a
better
place
than
this
old
chamber
now
in
my
mind
he
ought
to
place
the
picture
of
a
lady
who
gave
him
all
these
riches
in
the
handsomest
room
in
the
castle
but
he
may
have
good
reasons
for
what
he
does
and
some
people
do
say
that
he
has
lost
his
riches
as
well
as
his
gratitude
but
hush
maâ€™am
not
a
wordâ€
added
annette
laying
her
finger
on
her
lips
emily
was
too
much
absorbed
in
thought
to
hear
what
she
said
â€œâ€™tis
a
handsome
lady
i
am
sureâ€
continued
annette
â€œthe
signor
need
not
be
ashamed
to
put
her
in
the
great
apartment
where
the
veiled
picture
hangsâ€
emily
turned
round
â€œbut
for
that
matter
she
would
be
as
little
seen
there
as
here
for
the
door
is
always
locked
i
findâ€
â€œlet
us
leave
this
chamberâ€
said
emily
â€œand
let
me
caution
you
again
annette
be
guarded
in
your
conversation
and
never
tell
that
you
know
anything
of
that
pictureâ€
â€œholy
motherâ€
exclaimed
annette
â€œit
is
no
secret
why
all
the
servants
have
seen
it
alreadyâ€
emily
started
â€œhow
is
thisâ€
said
sheâ€”â€œhave
seen
it
whenâ€”howâ€
â€œdear
maâ€™amselle
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
that
we
had
all
a
little
more
curiousness
than
you
hadâ€
â€œi
thought
you
told
me
the
door
was
kept
lockedâ€
said
emily
â€œif
that
was
the
case
maâ€™amselleâ€
replied
annette
looking
about
her
â€œhow
could
we
get
hereâ€
â€œoh
you
mean
this
pictureâ€
said
emily
with
returning
calmness
â€œwell
annette
here
is
nothing
more
to
engage
my
attention
we
will
goâ€
emily
as
she
passed
to
her
own
apartment
saw
montoni
go
down
to
the
hall
and
she
turned
into
her
auntâ€™s
dressing-room
whom
she
found
weeping
and
alone
grief
and
resentment
struggling
on
her
countenance
pride
had
hitherto
restrained
complaint
judging
of
emilyâ€™s
disposition
from
her
own
and
from
a
consciousness
of
what
her
treatment
of
her
deserved
she
had
believed
that
her
griefs
would
be
cause
of
triumph
to
her
niece
rather
than
of
sympathy
that
she
would
despise
not
pity
her
but
she
knew
not
the
tenderness
and
benevolence
of
emilyâ€™s
heart
that
had
always
taught
her
to
forget
her
own
injuries
in
the
misfortunes
of
her
enemy
the
sufferings
of
others
whoever
they
might
be
called
forth
her
ready
compassion
which
dissipated
at
once
every
obscuring
cloud
to
goodness
that
passion
or
prejudice
might
have
raised
in
her
mind
madame
montoniâ€™s
sufferings
at
length
rose
above
her
pride
and
when
emily
had
before
entered
the
room
she
would
have
told
them
all
had
not
her
husband
prevented
her
now
that
she
was
no
longer
restrained
by
his
presence
she
poured
forth
all
her
complaints
to
her
niece
â€œo
emilyâ€
she
exclaimed
â€œi
am
the
most
wretched
of
womenâ€”i
am
indeed
cruelly
treated
who
with
my
prospects
of
happiness
could
have
foreseen
such
a
wretched
fate
as
thisâ€”who
could
have
thought
when
i
married
such
a
man
as
the
signor
i
should
ever
have
to
bewail
my
lot
but
there
is
no
judging
what
is
for
the
bestâ€”there
is
no
knowing
what
is
for
our
good
the
most
flattering
prospects
often
changeâ€”the
best
judgments
may
be
deceivedâ€”who
could
have
foreseen
when
i
married
the
signor
that
i
should
ever
repent
my
generosityâ€
emily
thought
she
might
have
foreseen
it
but
this
was
not
a
thought
of
triumph
she
placed
herself
in
a
chair
near
her
aunt
took
her
hand
and
with
one
of
those
looks
of
soft
compassion
which
might
characterise
the
countenance
of
a
guardian
angel
spoke
to
her
in
the
tenderest
accents
but
these
did
not
sooth
madame
montoni
whom
impatience
to
talk
made
unwilling
to
listen
she
wanted
to
complain
not
to
be
consoled
and
it
was
by
exclamations
of
complaint
only
that
emily
learned
the
particular
circumstances
of
her
affliction
â€œungrateful
manâ€
said
madame
montoni
â€œhe
has
deceived
me
in
every
respect
and
now
he
has
taken
me
from
my
country
and
friends
to
shut
me
up
in
this
old
castle
and
here
he
thinks
he
can
compel
me
to
do
whatever
he
designs
but
he
shall
find
himself
mistaken
he
shall
find
that
no
threats
can
alterâ€”but
who
would
have
believed
who
would
have
supposed
that
a
man
of
his
family
and
apparent
wealth
had
absolutely
no
fortuneâ€”no
scarcely
a
sequin
of
his
own
i
did
all
for
the
best
i
thought
he
was
a
man
of
consequence
of
great
property
or
i
am
sure
i
would
never
have
married
himâ€”ungrateful
artful
manâ€
she
paused
to
take
breath
â€œdear
madam
be
composedâ€
said
emily
â€œthe
signor
may
not
be
so
rich
as
you
had
reason
to
expect
but
surely
he
cannot
be
very
poor
since
this
castle
and
the
mansion
at
venice
are
his
may
i
ask
what
are
the
circumstances
that
particularly
affect
youâ€
â€œwhat
are
the
circumstancesâ€
exclaimed
madame
montoni
with
resentment
â€œwhy
is
it
not
sufficient
that
he
had
long
ago
ruined
his
own
fortune
by
play
and
that
he
has
since
lost
what
i
brought
himâ€”and
that
now
he
would
compel
me
to
sign
away
my
settlement
it
was
well
i
had
the
chief
of
my
property
settled
on
myself
that
he
may
lose
this
also
or
throw
it
away
in
wild
schemes
which
nobody
can
understand
but
himself
and
andâ€”is
not
all
this
sufficientâ€
â€œit
is
indeedâ€
said
emily
â€œbut
you
must
recollect
dear
madam
that
i
knew
nothing
of
all
thisâ€
â€œwell
and
is
it
not
sufficientâ€
rejoined
her
aunt
â€œthat
he
is
also
absolutely
ruined
that
he
is
sunk
deeply
in
debt
and
that
neither
this
castle
nor
the
mansion
at
venice
is
his
own
if
all
his
debts
honourable
and
dishonourable
were
paidâ€
â€œi
am
shocked
by
what
you
tell
me
madamâ€
said
emily
â€œand
is
it
not
enoughâ€
interrupted
madame
montoni
â€œthat
he
has
treated
me
with
neglect
with
cruelty
because
i
refused
to
relinquish
my
settlements
and
instead
of
being
frightened
by
his
menaces
resolutely
defied
him
and
upbraided
him
with
his
shameful
conduct
but
i
bore
all
meeklyâ€”you
know
niece
i
never
uttered
a
word
of
complaint
till
now
no
that
such
a
disposition
as
mine
should
be
so
imposed
upon
that
i
whose
only
faults
are
too
much
kindness
too
much
generosity
should
be
chained
for
life
to
such
a
vile
deceitful
cruel
monsterâ€
want
of
breath
compelled
madame
montoni
to
stop
if
anything
could
have
made
emily
smile
in
these
moments
it
would
have
been
this
speech
of
her
aunt
delivered
in
a
voice
very
little
below
a
scream
and
with
a
vehemence
of
gesticulation
and
of
countenance
that
turned
the
whole
into
burlesque
emily
saw
that
her
misfortunes
did
not
admit
of
real
consolation
and
contemning
the
commonplace
terms
of
superficial
comfort
she
was
silent
while
madame
montoni
jealous
of
her
own
consequence
mistook
this
for
the
silence
of
indifference
or
of
contempt
and
reproached
her
with
want
of
duty
and
feeling
â€œo
i
suspected
what
all
this
boasted
sensibility
would
prove
to
beâ€
rejoined
she
â€œi
thought
it
would
not
teach
you
to
feel
either
duty
or
affection
for
your
relations
who
have
treated
you
like
their
own
daughterâ€
â€œpardon
me
madamâ€
said
emily
mildly
â€œit
is
not
natural
to
me
to
boast
and
if
it
was
i
am
sure
i
would
not
boast
of
sensibilityâ€”a
quality
perhaps
more
to
be
feared
than
desiredâ€
â€œwell
well
niece
i
will
not
dispute
with
you
but
as
i
said
montoni
threatens
me
with
violence
if
i
any
longer
refuse
to
sign
away
my
settlements
and
this
was
the
subject
of
our
contest
when
you
came
into
the
room
before
now
i
am
determined
no
power
on
earth
shall
make
me
do
this
neither
will
i
bear
all
this
tamely
he
shall
hear
his
true
character
from
me
i
will
tell
him
all
he
deserves
in
spite
of
his
threats
and
cruel
treatmentâ€
emily
seized
a
pause
of
madame
montoniâ€™s
voice
to
speak
â€œdear
madamâ€
said
she
â€œbut
will
not
this
serve
to
irritate
the
signor
unnecessarily
will
it
not
provoke
the
harsh
treatment
you
dreadâ€
â€œi
do
not
careâ€
replied
madame
montoni
â€œit
does
not
signify
i
will
not
submit
to
such
usage
you
would
have
me
give
up
my
settlements
too
i
supposeâ€
â€œno
madam
i
do
not
exactly
mean
thatâ€
â€œwhat
is
it
you
do
mean
thenâ€
â€œyou
spoke
of
reproaching
the
signorâ€â€”said
emily
with
hesitation
â€œwhy
does
he
not
deserve
reproachesâ€
said
her
aunt
â€œcertainly
he
does
but
will
it
be
prudent
in
you
madam
to
make
themâ€
â€œprudentâ€
exclaimed
madame
montoni
â€œis
this
a
time
to
talk
of
prudence
when
one
is
threatened
with
all
sorts
of
violenceâ€
â€œit
is
to
avoid
that
violence
that
prudence
is
necessaryâ€
said
emily
â€œof
prudenceâ€
continued
madame
montoni
without
attending
to
her
â€œof
prudence
towards
a
man
who
does
not
scruple
to
break
all
the
common
ties
of
humanity
in
his
conduct
to
me
and
is
it
for
me
to
consider
prudence
in
my
behaviour
towards
him
i
am
not
so
meanâ€
â€œit
is
for
your
own
sake
not
for
the
signorâ€™s
madamâ€
said
emily
modestly
â€œthat
you
should
consult
prudence
your
reproaches
however
just
cannot
punish
him
but
they
may
provoke
him
to
further
violence
against
youâ€
â€œwhat
would
you
have
me
submit
then
to
whatever
he
commandsâ€”would
you
have
me
kneel
down
at
his
feet
and
thank
him
for
his
cruelties
would
you
have
me
give
up
my
settlementsâ€
â€œhow
much
you
mistake
me
madamâ€
said
emily
â€œi
am
unequal
to
advise
you
on
a
point
so
important
as
the
last
but
you
will
pardon
me
for
saying
that
if
you
consult
your
own
peace
you
will
try
to
conciliate
signor
montoni
rather
than
to
irritate
him
by
reproachesâ€
â€œconciliate
indeed
i
tell
you
niece
it
is
utterly
impossible
i
disdain
to
attempt
itâ€
emily
was
shocked
to
observe
the
perverted
understanding
and
obstinate
temper
of
madame
montoni
but
not
less
grieved
for
her
sufferings
she
looked
round
for
some
alleviating
circumstance
to
offer
her
â€œyour
situation
is
perhaps
not
so
desperate
dear
madamâ€
said
emily
â€œas
you
may
imagine
the
signor
may
represent
his
affairs
to
be
worse
than
they
are
for
the
purpose
of
pleading
a
stronger
necessity
for
his
possession
of
your
settlement
besides
so
long
as
you
keep
this
you
may
look
forward
to
it
as
a
resource
at
least
that
will
afford
you
a
competence
should
the
signorâ€™s
future
conduct
compel
you
to
sue
for
separationâ€
madame
montoni
impatiently
interrupted
her
â€œunfeeling
cruel
girlâ€
said
she
â€œand
so
you
would
persuade
me
that
i
have
no
reason
to
complain
that
the
signor
is
in
very
flourishing
circumstances
that
my
future
prospects
promise
nothing
but
comfort
and
that
my
griefs
are
as
fanciful
and
romantic
as
your
own
is
it
the
way
to
console
me
to
endeavour
to
persuade
me
out
of
my
senses
and
my
feelings
because
you
happen
to
have
no
feelings
yourself
i
thought
i
was
opening
my
heart
to
a
person
who
could
sympathise
in
my
distress
but
i
find
that
your
people
of
sensibility
can
feel
for
nobody
but
themselves
you
may
retire
to
your
chamberâ€
emily
without
replying
immediately
left
the
room
with
a
mingled
emotion
of
pity
and
contempt
and
hastened
to
her
own
where
she
yielded
to
the
mournful
reflections
which
a
knowledge
of
her
auntâ€™s
situation
had
occasioned
the
conversation
of
the
italian
with
valancourt
in
france
again
occurred
to
her
his
hints
respecting
the
broken
fortunes
of
montoni
were
now
completely
justified
those
also
concerning
his
character
appeared
not
less
so
though
the
particular
circumstances
connected
with
his
fame
to
which
the
stranger
had
alluded
yet
remained
to
be
explained
notwithstanding
that
her
own
observations
and
the
words
of
count
morano
had
convinced
her
that
montoniâ€™s
situation
was
not
what
it
formerly
appeared
to
be
the
intelligence
she
had
just
received
from
her
aunt
on
this
point
struck
her
with
all
the
force
of
astonishment
which
was
not
weakened
when
she
considered
the
present
style
of
montoniâ€™s
living
the
number
of
servants
he
maintained
and
the
new
expences
he
was
incurring
by
repairing
and
fortifying
his
castle
her
anxiety
for
her
aunt
and
for
herself
increased
with
reflection
several
assertions
of
morano
which
on
the
preceding
night
she
had
believed
were
prompted
either
by
interest
or
by
resentment
now
returned
to
her
mind
with
the
strength
of
truth
she
could
not
doubt
that
montoni
had
formerly
agreed
to
give
her
to
the
count
for
a
pecuniary
rewardâ€”his
character
and
his
distressed
circumstances
justified
the
belief
these
also
seemed
to
confirm
moranoâ€™s
assertion
that
he
now
designed
to
dispose
of
her
more
advantageously
for
himself
to
a
richer
suitor
amidst
the
reproaches
which
morano
had
thrown
out
against
montoni
he
had
saidâ€”he
would
not
quit
the
castle
he
dared
to
call
his
nor
willingly
leave
another
murder
on
his
conscienceâ€”hints
which
might
have
no
other
origin
than
the
passion
of
the
moment
but
emily
was
now
inclined
to
account
for
them
more
seriously
and
she
shuddered
to
think
that
she
was
in
the
hands
of
a
man
to
whom
it
was
even
possible
they
could
apply
at
length
considering
that
reflection
could
neither
release
her
from
her
melancholy
situation
nor
enable
her
to
bear
it
with
greater
fortitude
she
tried
to
divert
her
anxiety
and
took
down
from
her
little
library
a
volume
of
her
favourite
ariosto
but
his
wild
imagery
and
rich
invention
could
not
long
enchant
her
attention
his
spells
did
not
reach
her
heart
and
over
her
sleeping
fancy
they
played
without
awakening
it
she
now
put
aside
the
book
and
took
her
lute
for
it
was
seldom
that
her
sufferings
refused
to
yield
to
the
magic
of
sweet
sounds
when
they
did
so
she
was
oppressed
by
sorrow
that
came
from
excess
of
tenderness
and
regret
and
there
were
times
when
music
had
increased
such
sorrow
to
a
degree
that
was
scarcely
endurable
when
if
it
had
not
suddenly
ceased
she
might
have
lost
her
reason
such
was
the
time
when
she
mourned
for
her
father
and
heard
the
midnight
strains
that
floated
by
her
window
near
the
convent
in
languedoc
on
the
night
that
followed
his
death
she
continued
to
play
till
annette
brought
dinner
into
her
chamber
at
which
emily
was
surprised
and
enquired
whose
order
she
obeyed
â€œmy
ladyâ€™s
maâ€™amselleâ€
replied
annette
â€œthe
signor
ordered
her
dinner
to
be
carried
to
her
own
apartment
and
so
she
has
sent
you
yours
there
have
been
sad
doings
between
them
worse
than
ever
i
thinkâ€
emily
not
appearing
to
notice
what
she
said
sat
down
to
the
little
table
that
was
spread
for
her
but
annette
was
not
to
be
silenced
thus
easily
while
she
waited
she
told
of
the
arrival
of
the
men
whom
emily
had
observed
on
the
ramparts
and
expressed
much
surprise
at
their
strange
appearance
as
well
as
at
the
manner
in
which
they
had
been
attended
by
montoniâ€™s
order
â€œdo
they
dine
with
the
signor
thenâ€
said
emily
â€œno
maâ€™amselle
they
dined
long
ago
in
an
apartment
at
the
north
end
of
the
castle
but
i
know
not
when
they
are
to
go
for
the
signor
told
old
carlo
to
see
them
provided
with
everything
necessary
they
have
been
walking
all
about
the
castle
and
asking
questions
of
the
workmen
on
the
ramparts
i
never
saw
such
strange-looking
men
in
my
life
i
am
frightened
whenever
i
see
themâ€

enquired
if
she
had
heard
of
count
morano
and
whether
he
was
likely
to
recover
but
annette
only
knew
that
he
was
lodged
in
a
cottage
in
the
wood
below
and
that
everybody
said
he
must
die
emilyâ€™s
countenance
discovered
her
emotion
â€œdear
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œto
see
how
young
ladies
will
disguise
themselves
when
they
are
in
love
i
thought
you
hated
the
count
or
i
am
sure
i
would
not
have
told
you
and
i
am
sure
you
have
cause
enough
to
hate
himâ€
â€œi
hope
i
hate
nobodyâ€
replied
emily
trying
to
smile
â€œbut
certainly
i
do
not
love
count
morano
i
should
be
shocked
to
hear
of
any
person
dying
by
violent
meansâ€
â€œyes
maâ€™amselle
but
it
is
his
own
faultâ€
emily
looked
displeased
and
annette
mistaking
the
cause
of
her
displeasure
immediately
began
to
excuse
the
count
in
her
way
â€œto
be
sure
it
was
very
ungenteel
behaviourâ€
said
she
â€œto
break
into
a
ladyâ€™s
room
and
then
when
he
found
his
discoursing
was
not
agreeable
to
her
to
refuse
to
go
and
then
when
the
gentleman
of
the
castle
comes
to
desire
him
to
walk
about
his
businessâ€”to
turn
round
and
draw
his
sword
and
swear
heâ€™ll
run
him
through
the
body
to
be
sure
it
was
very
ungenteel
behaviour
but
then
he
was
disguised
in
love
and
so
did
not
know
what
he
was
aboutâ€
â€œenough
of
thisâ€
said
emily
who
now
smiled
without
an
effort
and
annette
returned
to
a
mention
of
the
disagreement
between
montoni
and
her
lady
â€œit
is
nothing
newâ€
said
she
â€œwe
saw
and
heard
enough
of
this
at
venice
though
i
never
told
you
of
it
maâ€™amselleâ€
â€œwell
annette
it
was
very
prudent
of
you
not
to
mention
it
then
be
as
prudent
now
the
subject
is
an
unpleasant
oneâ€
â€œah
dear
maâ€™amselleâ€”to
see
now
how
considerate
you
can
be
about
some
folks
who
care
so
little
about
you
i
cannot
bear
to
see
you
so
deceived
and
i
must
tell
you
but
it
is
all
for
your
own
good
and
not
to
spite
my
lady
though
to
speak
truth
i
have
little
reason
to
love
her
butâ€”â€
â€œyou
are
not
speaking
thus
of
my
aunt
i
hope
annetteâ€
said
emily
gravely
â€œyes
maâ€™amselle
but
i
am
though
and
if
you
knew
as
much
as
i
do
you
would
not
look
so
angry
i
have
often
and
often
heard
the
signor
and
her
talking
over
your
marriage
with
the
count
and
she
always
advised
him
never
to
give
up
to
your
foolish
whims
as
she
was
pleased
to
call
them
but
to
be
resolute
and
compel
you
to
be
obedient
whether
you
would
or
no
and
i
am
sure
my
heart
has
ached
a
thousand
times
and
i
have
thought
when
she
was
so
unhappy
herself
she
might
have
felt
a
little
for
other
people
andâ€”â€
â€œi
thank
you
for
your
pity
annetteâ€
said
emily
interrupting
her
â€œbut
my
aunt
was
unhappy
then
and
that
disturbed
her
temper
perhaps
or
i
thinkâ€”i
am
sureâ€”you
may
take
away
annette
i
have
doneâ€
â€œdear
maâ€™amselle
you
have
eat
nothing
at
all
do
try
and
take
a
little
bit
more
disturbed
her
temper
truly
why
her
temper
is
always
disturbed
i
think
and
at
thoulouse
i
have
heard
my
lady
talking
of
you
and
mons
valancourt
to
madame
merveille
and
madame
vaison
often
and
often
in
a
very
ill-natured
way
as
i
thought
telling
them
what
a
deal
of
trouble
she
had
to
keep
you
in
order
and
what
a
fatigue
and
distress
it
was
to
her
and
that
she
believed
you
would
run
away
with
mons
valancourt
if
she
was
not
to
watch
you
closely
and
that
you
connived
at
his
coming
about
the
house
at
night
andâ€”â€
â€œgood
godâ€
exclaimed
emily
blushing
deeply
â€œit
is
surely
impossible
my
aunt
could
thus
have
represented
meâ€
â€œindeed
maâ€™am
i
say
nothing
more
than
the
truth
and
not
all
of
that
but
i
thought
myself
she
might
have
found
something
better
to
discourse
about
than
the
faults
of
her
own
niece
even
if
you
had
been
in
fault
maâ€™amselle
but
i
did
not
believe
a
word
of
what
she
said
but
my
lady
does
not
care
what
she
says
against
anybody
for
that
matterâ€
â€œhowever
that
may
be
annetteâ€
interrupted
emily
recovering
her
composure
â€œit
does
not
become
you
to
speak
of
the
faults
of
my
aunt
to
me
i
know
you
have
meant
well
butâ€”say
no
moreâ€”i
have
quite
dinedâ€
annette
blushed
looked
down
and
then
began
slowly
to
clear
the
table
â€œis
this
then
the
reward
of
my
ingenuousnessâ€
said
emily
when
she
was
alone
â€œthe
treatment
i
am
to
receive
from
a
relationâ€”an
auntâ€”who
ought
to
have
been
the
guardian
not
the
slanderer
of
my
reputationâ€”who
as
a
woman
ought
to
have
respected
the
delicacy
of
female
honour
and
as
a
relation
should
have
protected
mine
but
to
utter
falsehoods
on
so
nice
a
subjectâ€”to
repay
the
openness
and
i
may
say
with
honest
pride
the
propriety
of
my
conduct
with
slandersâ€”required
a
depravity
of
heart
such
as
i
could
scarcely
have
believed
existed
such
as
i
weep
to
find
in
a
relation
o
what
a
contrast
does
her
character
present
to
that
of
my
beloved
father
while
envy
and
low
cunning
form
the
chief
traits
of
hers
his
was
distinguished
by
benevolence
and
philosophic
wisdom
but
now
let
me
only
remember
if
possible
that
she
is
unfortunateâ€
emily
threw
her
veil
over
her
and
went
down
to
walk
upon
the
ramparts
the
only
walk
indeed
which
was
open
to
her
though
she
often
wished
that
she
might
be
permitted
to
ramble
among
the
woods
below
and
still
more
that
she
might
sometimes
explore
the
sublime
scenes
of
the
surrounding
country
but
as
montoni
would
not
suffer
her
to
pass
the
gates
of
the
castle
she
tried
to
be
contented
with
the
romantic
views
she
beheld
from
the
walls
the
peasants
who
had
been
employed
on
the
fortifications
had
left
their
work
and
the
ramparts
were
silent
and
solitary
their
lonely
appearance
together
with
the
gloom
of
a
lowering
sky
assisted
the
musings
of
her
mind
and
threw
over
it
a
kind
of
melancholy
tranquillity
such
as
she
often
loved
to
indulge
she
turned
to
observe
a
fine
effect
of
the
sun
as
his
rays
suddenly
streaming
from
behind
a
heavy
cloud
lighted
up
the
west
towers
of
the
castle
while
the
rest
of
the
edifice
was
in
deep
shade
except
that
through
a
lofty
gothic
arch
adjoining
the
tower
which
led
to
another
terrace
the
beams
darted
in
full
splendour
and
showed
the
three
strangers
she
had
observed
in
the
morning
perceiving
them
she
started
and
a
momentary
fear
came
over
her
as
she
looked
up
the
long
rampart
and
saw
no
other
persons
while
she
hesitated
they
approached
the
gate
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
whither
they
were
advancing
she
knew
was
always
locked
and
she
could
not
depart
by
the
opposite
extremity
without
meeting
them
but
before
she
passed
them
she
hastily
drew
a
thin
veil
over
her
face
which
did
indeed
but
ill
conceal
her
beauty
they
looked
earnestly
at
her
and
spoke
to
each
other
in
bad
italian
of
which
she
caught
only
a
few
words
but
the
fierceness
of
their
countenances
now
that
she
was
near
enough
to
discriminate
them
struck
her
yet
more
than
the
wild
singularity
of
their
air
and
dress
had
formerly
done
it
was
the
countenance
and
figure
of
him
who
walked
between
the
other
two
that
chiefly
seized
her
attention
which
expressed
a
sullen
haughtiness
and
a
kind
of
dark
watchful
villany
that
gave
a
thrill
of
horror
to
her
heart
all
this
was
so
legibly
written
on
his
features
as
to
be
seen
by
a
single
glance
for
she
passed
the
group
swiftly
and
her
timid
eyes
scarcely
rested
on
them
a
moment
having
reached
the
terrace
she
stopped
and
perceived
the
strangers
standing
in
the
shadow
of
one
of
the
turrets
gazing
after
her
and
seemingly
by
their
action
in
earnest
conversation
she
immediately
left
the
rampart
and
retired
to
her
apartment
in
the
evening
montoni
sat
late
carousing
with
his
guests
in
the
cedar
chamber
his
recent
triumph
over
count
morano
or
perhaps
some
other
circumstance
contributed
to
elevate
his
spirits
to
an
unusual
height
he
filled
the
goblet
often
and
gave
a
loose
to
merriment
and
talk
the
gaiety
of
cavigni
on
the
contrary
was
somewhat
clouded
by
anxiety
he
kept
a
watchful
eye
upon
verezzi
whom
with
the
utmost
difficulty
he
had
hitherto
restrained
from
exasperating
montoni
further
against
morano
by
a
mention
of
his
late
taunting
words
one
of
the
company
exultingly
recurred
to
the
event
of
the
preceding
evening
verezziâ€™s
eyes
sparkled
the
mention
of
morano
led
to
that
of
emily
of
whom
they
were
all
profuse
in
the
praise
except
montoni
who
sat
silent
and
then
interrupted
the
subject
when
the
servants
had
withdrawn
montoni
and
his
friends
entered
into
close
conversation
which
was
sometimes
checked
by
the
irascible
temper
of
verezzi
but
in
which
montoni
displayed
his
conscious
superiority
by
that
decisive
look
and
manner
which
always
accompanied
the
vigour
of
his
thought
and
to
which
most
of
his
companions
submitted
as
to
a
power
that
they
had
no
right
to
question
though
of
each
otherâ€™s
self-importance
they
were
jealously
scrupulous
amidst
this
conversation
one
of
them
imprudently
introduced
again
the
name
of
morano
and
verezzi
now
more
heated
by
wine
disregarded
the
expressive
looks
of
cavigni
and
gave
some
dark
hints
of
what
had
passed
on
the
preceding
night
these
however
montoni
did
not
appear
to
understand
for
he
continued
silent
in
his
chair
without
discovering
any
emotion
while
the
choler
of
verezzi
increasing
with
the
apparent
insensibility
of
montoni
he
at
length
told
the
suggestion
of
morano
that
this
castle
did
not
lawfully
belong
to
him
and
that
he
would
not
willingly
leave
another
murder
on
his
conscience
â€œam
i
to
be
insulted
at
my
own
table
and
by
my
own
friendsâ€
said
montoni
with
a
countenance
pale
in
anger
â€œwhy
are
the
words
of
that
madman
repeated
to
meâ€
verezzi
who
had
expected
to
hear
montoniâ€™s
indignation
poured
forth
against
morano
and
answered
by
thanks
to
himself
looked
with
astonishment
at
cavigni
who
enjoyed
his
confusion
â€œcan
you
be
weak
enough
to
credit
the
assertions
of
a
madmanâ€
rejoined
montoni
â€œor
what
is
the
same
thing
a
man
possessed
by
the
spirit
of
vengeance
but
he
has
succeeded
too
well
you
believe
what
he
saidâ€
â€œsignorâ€
said
verezzi
â€œwe
believe
only
what
we
knowâ€â€”â€œhowâ€
interrupted
montoni
sternly
â€œproduce
your
proofâ€
â€œwe
believe
only
what
we
knowâ€
repeated
verezzi
â€œand
we
know
nothing
of
what
morano
assertsâ€
montoni
seemed
to
recover
himself
â€œi
am
hasty
my
friendsâ€
said
he
â€œwith
respect
to
my
honour
no
man
shall
question
it
with
impunityâ€”you
did
not
mean
to
question
it
these
foolish
words
are
not
worth
your
remembrance
or
my
resentment
verezzi
here
is
to
your
first
exploitâ€
â€œsuccess
to
your
first
exploitâ€
re-echoed
the
whole
company
â€œnoble
signorâ€
replied
verezzi
glad
to
find
he
had
escaped
montoniâ€™s
resentment
â€œwith
my
good
will
you
shall
build
your
ramparts
of
goldâ€
â€œpass
the
gobletâ€
cried
montoni
â€œwe
will
drink
to
signora
st
aubertâ€
said
cavigni
â€œby
your
leave
we
will
first
drink
to
the
lady
of
the
castleâ€
said
bertoliniâ€”montoni
was
silent
â€œto
the
lady
of
the
castleâ€
said
his
guests
he
bowed
his
head
â€œit
much
surprises
me
signorâ€
said
bertolini
â€œthat
you
have
so
long
neglected
this
castle
it
is
a
noble
edificeâ€
â€œit
suits
our
purposeâ€
replied
montoni
â€œand
is
a
noble
edifice
you
know
not
it
seems
by
what
mischance
it
came
to
meâ€
â€œit
was
a
lucky
mischance
be
it
what
it
may
signorâ€
replied
bertolini
smiling
â€œi
would
that
one
so
lucky
had
befallen
meâ€
montoni
looked
gravely
at
him
â€œif
you
will
attend
to
what
i
sayâ€
he
resumed
â€œyou
shall
hear
the
storyâ€
the
countenances
of
bertolini
and
verezzi
expressed
something
more
than
curiosity
cavigni
who
seemed
to
feel
none
had
probably
heard
the
relation
before
â€œit
is
now
near
twenty
yearsâ€
said
montoni
â€œsince
this
castle
came
into
my
possession
i
inherit
it
by
the
female
line
the
lady
my
predecessor
was
only
distantly
related
to
me
i
am
the
last
of
her
family
she
was
beautiful
and
rich
i
wooed
her
but
her
heart
was
fixed
upon
another
and
she
rejected
me
it
is
probable
however
that
she
was
herself
rejected
of
the
person
whoever
he
might
be
on
whom
she
bestowed
her
favour
for
a
deep
and
settled
melancholy
took
possession
of
her
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
she
put
a
period
to
her
own
life
i
was
not
at
the
castle
at
the
time
but
as
there
are
some
singular
and
mysterious
circumstances
attending
that
event
i
shall
repeat
themâ€
â€œrepeat
themâ€
said
a
voice
montoni
was
silent
the
guests
looked
at
each
other
to
know
who
spoke
but
they
perceived
that
each
was
making
the
same
enquiry
montoni
at
length
recovered
himself
â€œwe
are
overheardâ€
said
he
â€œwe
will
finish
this
subject
another
time
pass
the
gobletâ€
the
cavaliers
looked
round
the
wide
chamber
â€œhere
is
no
person
but
ourselvesâ€
said
verezzi
â€œpray
signor
proceedâ€
â€œdid
you
hear
anythingâ€
said
montoni
â€œwe
didâ€
said
bertolini
â€œit
could
be
only
fancyâ€
said
verezzi
looking
round
again
â€œwe
see
no
person
besides
ourselves
and
the
sound
i
thought
i
heard
seemed
within
the
room
pray
signor
go
onâ€
montoni
paused
a
moment
and
then
proceeded
in
a
lowered
voice
while
the
cavaliers
drew
nearer
to
attend
â€œye
are
to
know
signors
that
the
lady
laurentini
had
for
some
months
shown
symptoms
of
a
dejected
mind
nay
of
a
disturbed
imagination
her
mood
was
very
unequal
sometimes
she
was
sunk
in
calm
melancholy
and
at
others
as
i
have
been
told
she
betrayed
all
the
symptoms
of
frantic
madness
it
was
one
night
in
the
month
of
october
after
she
had
recovered
from
one
of
those
fits
of
excess
and
had
sunk
again
into
her
usual
melancholy
that
she
retired
alone
to
her
chamber
and
forbade
all
interruption
it
was
the
chamber
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
signors
where
we
had
the
affray
last
night
from
that
hour
she
was
seen
no
moreâ€
â€œhow
seen
no
moreâ€
said
bertolini
â€œwas
not
her
body
found
in
the
chamberâ€
â€œwere
her
remains
never
foundâ€
cried
the
rest
of
the
company
all
together
â€œneverâ€
replied
montoni
â€œwhat
reasons
were
there
to
suppose
she
destroyed
herself
thenâ€
said
bertoliniâ€”â€œaye
what
reasonsâ€
said
verezziâ€”â€œhow
happened
it
that
her
remains
were
never
found
although
she
killed
herself
she
could
not
bury
herselfâ€
montoni
looked
indignantly
at
verezzi
who
began
to
apologise
â€œyour
pardon
signorâ€
said
he
â€œi
did
not
consider
that
the
lady
was
your
relative
when
i
spoke
of
her
so
lightlyâ€
montoni
accepted
the
apology
â€œbut
the
signor
will
oblige
us
with
the
reasons
which
urged
him
to
believe
that
the
lady
committed
suicideâ€
â€œthose
i
will
explain
hereafterâ€
said
montoni
â€œat
present
let
me
relate
a
most
extraordinary
circumstance
this
conversation
goes
no
further
signors
listen
then
to
what
i
am
going
to
sayâ€
â€œlistenâ€
said
a
voice
they
were
all
again
silent
and
the
countenance
of
montoni
changed
â€œthis
is
no
illusion
of
the
fancyâ€
said
cavigni
at
length
breaking
the
profound
silenceâ€”â€œnoâ€
said
bertolini
â€œi
heard
it
myself
now
yet
here
is
no
person
in
the
room
but
ourselvesâ€
â€œthis
is
very
extraordinaryâ€
said
montoni
suddenly
rising
â€œthis
is
not
to
be
borne
here
is
some
deception
some
trick
i
will
know
what
it
meansâ€
all
the
company
rose
from
their
chairs
in
confusion
â€œit
is
very
oddâ€
said
bertolini
â€œhere
is
really
no
stranger
in
the
room
if
it
is
a
trick
signor
you
will
do
well
to
punish
the
author
of
it
severelyâ€
â€œa
trick
what
else
can
it
beâ€
said
cavigni
affecting
a
laugh
the
servants
were
now
summoned
and
the
chamber
was
searched
but
no
person
was
found
the
surprise
and
consternation
of
the
company
increased
montoni
was
discomposed
â€œwe
will
leave
this
roomâ€
said
he
â€œand
the
subject
of
our
conversation
also
it
is
too
solemnâ€
his
guests
were
equally
ready
to
quit
the
apartment
but
the
subject
had
roused
their
curiosity
and
they
entreated
montoni
to
withdraw
to
another
chamber
and
finish
it
no
entreaties
could
however
prevail
with
him
notwithstanding
his
efforts
to
appear
at
ease
he
was
visibly
and
greatly
disordered
â€œwhy
signor
you
are
not
superstitiousâ€
cried
verezzi
jeeringly
â€œyou
who
have
so
often
laughed
at
the
credulity
of
othersâ€
â€œi
am
not
superstitiousâ€
replied
montoni
regarding
him
with
stern
displeasure
â€œthough
i
know
how
to
despise
the
common-place
sentences
which
are
frequently
uttered
against
superstition
i
will
enquire
further
into
this
affairâ€
he
then
left
the
room
and
his
guests
separating
for
the
night
retired
to
their
respective
apartments
he
wears
the
rose
of
youth
upon
his
cheek
shakespeare
we
now
return
to
valancourt
who
it
may
be
remembered
remained
at
thoulouse
some
time
after
the
departure
of
emily
restless
and
miserable
each
morrow
that
approached
he
designed
should
carry
him
from
thence
yet
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
came
and
still
saw
him
lingering
in
the
scene
of
his
former
happiness
he
could
not
immediately
tear
himself
from
the
spot
where
he
had
been
accustomed
to
converse
with
emily
or
from
the
objects
they
had
viewed
together
which
appeared
to
him
memorials
of
her
affection
as
well
as
a
kind
of
surety
for
its
faithfulness
and
next
to
the
pain
of
bidding
her
adieu
was
that
of
leaving
the
scenes
which
so
powerfully
awakened
her
image
sometimes
he
had
bribed
a
servant
who
had
been
left
in
the
care
of
madame
montoniâ€™s
chã¢teau
to
permit
him
to
visit
the
gardens
and
there
he
would
wander
for
hours
together
rapt
in
a
melancholy
not
unpleasing
the
terrace
and
the
pavilion
at
the
end
of
it
where
he
had
taken
leave
of
emily
on
the
eve
of
her
departure
from
thoulouse
were
his
most
favourite
haunts
there
as
he
walked
or
leaned
from
the
window
of
the
building
he
would
endeavour
to
recollect
all
she
had
said
on
that
night
to
catch
the
tones
of
her
voice
as
they
faintly
vibrated
on
his
memory
and
to
remember
the
exact
expression
of
her
countenance
which
sometimes
came
suddenly
to
his
fancy
like
a
vision
that
beautiful
countenance
which
awakened
as
by
instantaneous
magic
all
the
tenderness
of
his
heart
and
seemed
to
tell
with
irresistible
eloquenceâ€”that
he
had
lost
her
for
ever
at
these
moments
his
hurried
steps
would
have
discovered
to
a
spectator
the
despair
of
his
heart
the
character
of
montoni
such
as
he
had
received
from
hints
and
such
as
his
fears
represented
it
would
rise
to
his
view
together
with
all
the
dangers
it
seemed
to
threaten
to
emily
and
to
his
love
he
blamed
himself
that
he
had
not
urged
these
more
forcibly
to
her
while
it
might
have
been
in
his
power
to
detain
her
and
that
he
had
suffered
an
absurd
and
criminal
delicacy
as
he
termed
it
to
conquer
so
soon
the
reasonable
arguments
he
had
opposed
to
this
journey
any
evil
that
might
have
attended
their
marriage
seemed
so
inferior
to
those
which
now
threatened
their
love
or
even
to
the
sufferings
that
absence
occasioned
that
he
wondered
how
he
could
have
ceased
to
urge
his
suit
till
he
had
convinced
her
of
its
propriety
and
he
would
certainly
now
have
followed
her
to
italy
if
he
could
have
been
spared
from
his
regiment
for
so
long
a
journey
his
regiment
indeed
soon
reminded
him
that
he
had
other
duties
to
attend
than
those
of
love
a
short
time
after
his
arrival
at
his
brotherâ€™s
house
he
was
summoned
to
join
his
brother
officers
and
he
accompanied
a
battalion
to
paris
where
a
scene
of
novelty
and
gaiety
opened
upon
him
such
as
till
then
he
had
only
a
faint
idea
of
but
gaiety
disgusted
and
company
fatigued
his
sick
mind
and
he
became
an
object
of
unceasing
raillery
to
his
companions
from
whom
whenever
he
could
steal
an
opportunity
he
escaped
to
think
of
emily
the
scenes
around
him
however
and
the
company
with
whom
he
was
obliged
to
mingle
engaged
his
attention
though
they
failed
to
amuse
his
fancy
and
thus
gradually
weakened
the
habit
of
yielding
to
lamentation
till
it
appeared
less
a
duty
to
his
love
to
indulge
it
among
his
brother-officers
were
many
who
added
to
the
ordinary
character
of
a
french
soldierâ€™s
gaiety
some
of
those
fascinating
qualities
which
too
frequently
throw
a
veil
over
folly
and
sometimes
even
soften
the
features
of
vice
into
smiles
to
these
men
the
reserved
and
thoughtful
manners
of
valancourt
were
a
kind
of
tacit
censure
on
their
own
for
which
they
rallied
him
when
present
and
plotted
against
him
when
absent
they
gloried
in
the
thought
of
reducing
him
to
their
own
level
and
considering
it
to
be
a
spirited
frolic
determined
to
accomplish
it
valancourt
was
a
stranger
to
the
gradual
progress
of
scheme
and
intrigue
against
which
he
could
not
be
on
his
guard
he
had
not
been
accustomed
to
receive
ridicule
and
he
could
ill
endure
its
sting
he
resented
it
and
this
only
drew
upon
him
a
louder
laugh
to
escape
from
such
scenes
he
fled
into
solitude
and
there
the
image
of
emily
met
him
and
revived
the
pangs
of
love
and
despair
he
then
sought
to
renew
those
tasteful
studies
which
had
been
the
delight
of
his
early
years
but
his
mind
had
lost
the
tranquillity
which
is
necessary
for
their
enjoyment
to
forget
himself
and
the
grief
and
anxiety
which
the
idea
of
her
recalled
he
would
quit
his
solitude
and
again
mingle
in
the
crowdâ€”glad
of
a
temporary
relief
and
rejoicing
to
snatch
amusement
for
the
moment
thus
passed
weeks
after
weeks
time
gradually
softening
his
sorrow
and
habit
strengthening
his
desire
of
amusement
till
the
scenes
around
him
seemed
to
awaken
into
a
new
character
and
valancourt
to
have
fallen
among
them
from
the
clouds
his
figure
and
address
made
him
a
welcome
visitor
wherever
he
had
been
introduced
and
he
soon
frequented
the
most
gay
and
fashionable
circles
of
paris
among
these
was
the
assembly
of
the
countess
lacleur
a
woman
of
eminent
beauty
and
captivating
manners
she
had
passed
the
spring
of
youth
but
her
wit
prolonged
the
triumph
of
its
reign
and
they
mutually
assisted
the
fame
of
each
other
for
those
who
were
charmed
by
her
loveliness
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
her
talents
and
others
who
admired
her
playful
imagination
declared
that
her
personal
graces
were
unrivalled
but
her
imagination
was
merely
playful
and
her
wit
if
such
it
could
be
called
was
brilliant
rather
than
just
it
dazzled
and
its
fallacy
escaped
the
detection
of
the
moment
for
the
accents
in
which
she
pronounced
it
and
the
smile
that
accompanied
them
were
a
spell
upon
the
judgment
of
the
auditors
her
petits
soupers
were
the
most
tasteful
of
any
in
paris
and
were
frequented
by
many
of
the
second
class
of
literati
she
was
fond
of
music
was
herself
a
scientific
performer
and
had
frequently
concerts
at
her
house
valancourt
who
passionately
loved
music
and
who
sometimes
assisted
at
these
concerts
admired
her
execution
but
remembered
with
a
sigh
the
eloquent
simplicity
of
emilyâ€™s
songs
and
the
natural
expression
of
her
manner
which
waited
not
to
be
approved
by
the
judgment
but
found
their
way
at
once
to
the
heart
madame
la
comtesse
had
often
deep
play
at
her
house
which
she
affected
to
restrain
but
secretly
encouraged
and
it
was
well
known
among
her
friends
that
the
splendour
of
her
establishment
was
chiefly
supplied
from
the
profits
of
her
tables
but
her
petits
soupers
were
the
most
charming
imaginable
here
were
all
the
delicacies
of
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
all
the
wit
and
the
lighter
efforts
of
genius
all
the
graces
of
conversationâ€”the
smiles
of
beauty
and
the
charm
of
music
and
valancourt
passed
his
pleasantest
as
well
as
most
dangerous
hours
in
these
parties
his
brother
who
remained
with
his
family
in
gascony
had
contented
himself
with
giving
him
letters
of
introduction
to
such
of
his
relations
residing
at
paris
as
the
latter
was
not
already
known
to
all
these
were
persons
of
some
distinction
and
as
neither
the
person
mind
nor
manners
of
valancourt
the
younger
threatened
to
disgrace
their
alliance
they
received
him
with
as
much
kindness
as
their
nature
hardened
by
uninterrupted
prosperity
would
admit
of
but
their
attentions
did
not
extend
to
acts
of
real
friendship
for
they
were
too
much
occupied
by
their
own
pursuits
to
feel
any
interest
in
his
and
thus
he
was
set
down
in
the
midst
of
paris
in
the
pride
of
youth
with
an
open
unsuspicious
temper
and
ardent
affections
without
one
friend
to
warn
him
of
the
dangers
to
which
he
was
exposed
emily
who
had
she
been
present
would
have
saved
him
from
these
evils
by
awakening
his
heart
and
engaging
him
in
worthy
pursuits
now
only
increased
his
dangerâ€”it
was
to
lose
the
grief
which
the
remembrance
of
her
occasioned
that
he
first
sought
amusement
and
for
this
end
he
pursued
it
till
habit
made
it
an
object
of
abstract
interest
there
was
also
a
marchioness
champfort
a
young
widow
at
whose
assemblies
he
passed
much
of
his
time
she
was
handsome
still
more
artful
gay
and
fond
of
intrigue
the
society
which
she
drew
round
her
was
less
elegant
and
more
vicious
than
that
of
the
countess
lacleur
but
as
she
had
address
enough
to
throw
a
veil
though
but
a
slight
one
over
the
worst
part
of
her
character
she
was
still
visited
by
many
persons
of
what
is
called
distinction
valancourt
was
introduced
to
her
parties
by
two
of
his
brother
officers
whose
late
ridicule
he
had
now
forgiven
so
far
that
he
could
sometimes
join
in
the
laugh
which
a
mention
of
his
former
manners
would
renew
the
gaiety
of
the
most
splendid
court
in
europe
the
magnificence
of
the
palaces
entertainments
and
equipages
that
surrounded
himâ€”all
conspired
to
dazzle
his
imagination
and
reanimate
his
spirits
and
the
example
and
maxims
of
his
military
associates
to
delude
his
mind
emilyâ€™s
image
indeed
still
lived
there
but
it
was
no
longer
the
friend
the
monitor
that
saved
him
from
himself
and
to
which
he
retired
to
weep
the
sweet
yet
melancholy
tears
of
tenderness
when
he
had
recourse
to
it
it
assumed
a
countenance
of
mild
reproach
that
wrung
his
soul
and
called
forth
tears
of
unmixed
misery
his
only
escape
from
which
was
to
forget
the
object
of
it
and
he
endeavoured
therefore
to
think
of
emily
as
seldom
as
he
could
thus
dangerously
circumstanced
was
valancourt
at
the
time
when
emily
was
suffering
at
venice
from
the
persecuting
addresses
of
count
morano
and
the
unjust
authority
of
montoni
at
which
period
we
leave
him
the
image
of
a
wicked
heinous
fault
lives
in
his
eye
that
close
aspect
of
his
does
show
the
mood
of
a
much-troubled
breast
king
john
leaving
the
gay
scenes
of
paris
we
return
to
those
of
the
gloomy
apennine
where
emilyâ€™s
thoughts
were
still
faithful
to
valancourt
looking
to
him
as
to
her
only
hope
she
recollected
with
jealous
exactness
every
assurance
and
every
proof
she
had
witnessed
of
his
affection
read
again
and
again
the
letters
she
had
received
from
him
weighed
with
intense
anxiety
the
force
of
every
word
that
spoke
of
his
attachment
and
dried
her
tears
as
she
trusted
in
his
truth
montoni
meanwhile
had
made
strict
enquiry
concerning
the
strange
circumstance
of
his
alarm
without
obtaining
information
and
was
at
length
obliged
to
account
for
it
by
the
reasonable
supposition
that
it
was
a
mischievous
trick
played
off
by
one
of
his
domestics
his
disagreements
with
madame
montoni
on
the
subject
of
her
settlements
were
now
more
frequent
than
ever
he
even
confined
her
entirely
to
her
own
apartment
and
did
not
scruple
to
threaten
her
with
much
greater
severity
should
she
persevere
in
a
refusal
reason
had
she
consulted
it
would
now
have
perplexed
her
in
the
choice
of
a
conduct
to
be
adopted
it
would
have
pointed
out
the
danger
of
irritating
by
further
opposition
a
man
such
as
montoni
had
proved
himself
to
be
and
to
whose
power
she
had
so
entirely
committed
herself
and
it
would
also
have
told
her
of
what
extreme
importance
to
her
future
comfort
it
was
to
reserve
for
herself
those
possessions
which
would
enable
her
to
live
independently
of
montoni
should
she
ever
escape
from
his
immediate
control
but
she
was
directed
by
a
more
decisive
guide
than
reasonâ€”the
spirit
of
revenge
which
urged
her
to
oppose
violence
to
violence
and
obstinacy
to
obstinacy
wholly
confined
to
the
solitude
of
her
apartment
she
was
now
reduced
to
solicit
the
society
she
had
lately
rejected
for
emily
was
the
only
person
except
annette
with
whom
she
was
permitted
to
converse
generously
anxious
for
her
peace
emily
therefore
tried
to
persuade
when
she
could
not
convince
and
sought
by
every
gentle
means
to
induce
her
to
forbear
that
asperity
of
reply
which
so
greatly
irritated
montoni
the
pride
of
her
aunt
did
sometimes
soften
to
the
soothing
voice
of
emily
and
there
even
were
moments
when
she
regarded
her
affectionate
attentions
with
goodwill
the
scenes
of
terrible
contention
to
which
emily
was
frequently
compelled
to
be
witness
exhausted
her
spirits
more
than
any
circumstances
that
had
occurred
since
her
departure
from
thoulouse
the
gentleness
and
goodness
of
her
parents
together
with
the
scenes
of
her
early
happiness
often
stole
on
her
mind
like
the
visions
of
a
higher
world
while
the
characters
and
circumstances
now
passing
beneath
her
eye
excited
both
terror
and
surprise
she
could
scarcely
have
imagined
that
passions
so
fierce
and
so
various
as
those
which
montoni
exhibited
could
have
been
concentrated
in
one
individual
yet
what
more
surprised
her
was
that
on
great
occasions
he
could
bend
these
passions
wild
as
they
were
to
the
cause
of
his
interest
and
generally
could
disguise
in
his
countenance
their
operation
on
his
mind
but
she
had
seen
him
too
often
when
he
had
thought
it
unnecessary
to
conceal
his
nature
to
be
deceived
on
such
occasions
her
present
life
appeared
like
the
dream
of
a
distempered
imagination
or
like
one
of
those
frightful
fictions
in
which
the
wild
genius
of
the
poets
sometimes
delighted
reflection
brought
only
regret
and
anticipation
terror
how
often
did
she
wish
to
â€œsteal
the
larkâ€™s
wing
and
mount
the
swiftest
galeâ€
that
languedoc
and
repose
might
once
more
be
hers
of
count
moranoâ€™s
health
she
made
frequent
enquiry
but
annette
heard
only
vague
reports
of
his
danger
and
that
his
surgeon
had
said
he
would
never
leave
the
cottage
alive
while
emily
could
not
but
be
shocked
to
think
that
she
however
innocently
might
be
the
means
of
his
death
and
annette
who
did
not
fail
to
observe
her
emotion
interpreted
it
in
her
own
way
but
a
circumstance
soon
occurred
which
entirely
withdrew
annetteâ€™s
attention
from
this
subject
and
awakened
the
surprise
and
curiosity
so
natural
to
her
coming
one
day
to
emilyâ€™s
apartment
with
a
countenance
full
of
importance
â€œwhat
can
all
this
mean
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
she
â€œwould
i
was
once
safe
in
languedoc
again
they
should
never
catch
me
going
on
my
travels
any
more
i
must
think
it
a
fine
thing
truly
to
come
abroad
and
see
foreign
parts
i
little
thought
i
was
coming
to
be
catched
up
in
an
old
castle
among
such
dreary
mountains
with
the
chance
of
being
murdered
or
what
is
as
good
having
my
throat
cutâ€
â€œwhat
can
all
this
mean
indeed
annetteâ€
said
emily
in
astonishment
â€œaye
maâ€™amselle
you
may
look
surprised
but
you
wonâ€™t
believe
it
perhaps
till
they
have
murdered
you
too
you
would
not
believe
about
the
ghost
i
told
you
of
though
i
showed
you
the
very
place
where
it
used
to
appearâ€”you
will
believe
nothing
maâ€™amselleâ€
â€œnot
till
you
speak
more
reasonably
annette
for
heavenâ€™s
sake
explain
your
meaning
you
spoke
of
murderâ€
â€œaye
maâ€™amselle
they
are
coming
to
murder
us
all
perhaps
but
what
signifies
explainingâ€”you
will
not
believeâ€
emily
again
desired
her
to
relate
what
she
had
seen
or
heard
â€œo
i
have
seen
enough
maâ€™am
and
heard
too
much
as
ludovico
can
prove
poor
soul
they
will
murder
him
too
i
little
thought
when
he
sung
those
sweet
verses
under
my
lattice
at
veniceâ€â€”emily
looked
impatient
and
displeased
â€œwell
maâ€™amselle
as
i
was
saying
these
preparations
about
the
castle
and
these
strange-looking
people
that
are
calling
here
every
day
and
the
signorâ€™s
cruel
usage
of
my
lady
and
his
odd
goings-onâ€”all
these
as
i
told
ludovico
can
bode
no
good
and
he
bid
me
hold
my
tongue
so
says
i
the
signorâ€™s
strangely
altered
ludovico
in
this
gloomy
castle
to
what
he
was
in
france
there
all
so
gay
nobody
so
gallant
to
my
lady
then
and
he
could
smile
too
upon
a
poor
servant
sometimes
and
jeer
her
too
good-naturedly
enough
i
remember
once
when
he
said
to
me
as
i
was
going
out
of
my
ladyâ€™s
dressing-roomâ€”annette
says
heâ€”â€
â€œnever
mind
what
the
signor
saidâ€
interrupted
emily
â€œbut
tell
me
at
once
the
circumstance
which
has
thus
alarmed
youâ€
â€œaye
maâ€™amselleâ€
rejoined
annette
â€œthat
is
just
what
ludovico
said
says
he
never
mind
what
the
signor
says
to
you
so
i
told
him
what
i
thought
about
the
signor
he
is
so
strangely
altered
said
i
for
now
he
is
so
haughty
and
so
commanding
and
so
sharp
with
my
lady
and
if
he
meets
one
heâ€™ll
scarcely
look
at
one
unless
it
be
to
frown
so
much
the
better
says
ludovico
so
much
the
better
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
maâ€™amselle
i
thought
this
was
a
very
ill-natured
speech
of
ludovico
but
i
went
on
and
then
says
i
he
is
always
knitting
his
brows
and
if
one
speaks
to
him
he
does
not
hear
and
then
he
sits
up
counselling
so
of
a
night
with
the
other
signorsâ€”there
they
are
till
long
past
midnight
discoursing
together
aye
but
says
ludovico
you
donâ€™t
know
what
they
are
counselling
about
no
said
i
but
i
can
guessâ€”it
is
about
my
young
lady
upon
that
ludovico
burst
out
a-laughing
quite
loud
so
he
put
me
in
a
huff
for
i
did
not
like
that
either
i
or
you
maâ€™amselle
should
be
laughed
at
and
i
turned
away
quick
but
he
stopped
me
â€˜donâ€™t
be
affronted
annetteâ€™
said
he
â€˜but
i
cannot
help
laughingâ€™
and
with
that
he
laughed
again
â€˜whatâ€™
says
he
â€˜do
you
think
the
signors
sit
up
night
after
night
only
to
counsel
about
thy
young
lady
no
no
there
is
something
more
in
the
wind
than
that
and
these
repairs
about
the
castle
and
these
preparations
about
the
rampartsâ€”they
are
not
making
about
young
ladiesâ€™
why
surely
said
i
the
signor
my
master
is
not
going
to
make
war
â€˜make
warâ€™
said
ludovico
â€˜what
upon
the
mountains
and
the
woods
for
here
is
no
living
soul
to
make
war
upon
that
i
seeâ€™
â€˜what
are
these
preparations
for
thenâ€™
said
i
why
surely
nobody
is
coming
to
take
away
my
masterâ€™s
castle
â€˜then
there
are
so
many
ill-looking
fellows
coming
to
the
castle
every
dayâ€™
says
ludovico
without
answering
my
question
â€˜and
the
signor
sees
them
all
and
talks
with
them
all
and
they
all
stay
in
the
neighbourhood
by
holy
st
marco
some
of
them
are
the
most
cut-throat-looking
dogs
i
ever
set
my
eyes
uponâ€™
â€œi
asked
ludovico
again
if
he
thought
they
were
coming
to
take
away
my
masterâ€™s
castle
and
he
said
no
he
did
not
think
they
were
but
he
did
not
know
for
certain
â€˜then
yesterdayâ€™
said
he
but
you
must
not
tell
this
maâ€™amselle
â€˜yesterday
a
party
of
these
men
came
and
left
all
their
horses
in
the
castle
stables
where
it
seems
they
are
to
stay
for
the
signor
ordered
them
all
to
be
entertained
with
the
best
provender
in
the
manger
but
the
men
are
most
of
them
in
the
neighbouring
cottagesâ€™
â€œso
maâ€™amselle
i
came
to
tell
you
all
this
for
i
never
heard
anything
so
strange
in
my
life
but
what
can
these
ill-looking
men
be
come
about
if
it
is
not
to
murder
us
and
the
signor
knows
this
or
why
should
he
be
so
civil
to
them
and
why
should
he
fortify
the
castle
and
counsel
so
much
with
the
other
signors
and
be
so
thoughtfulâ€
â€œis
this
all
you
have
to
tell
annetteâ€
said
emily
â€œhave
you
heard
nothing
else
that
alarms
youâ€
â€œnothing
else
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œwhy
is
not
this
enoughâ€
â€œquite
enough
for
my
patience
annette
but
not
quite
enough
to
convince
me
we
are
all
to
be
murdered
though
i
acknowledge
here
is
sufficient
food
for
curiosityâ€
she
forbore
to
speak
her
apprehensions
because
she
would
not
encourage
annetteâ€™s
wild
terrors
but
the
present
circumstances
of
the
castle
both
surprised
and
alarmed
her
annette
having
told
her
tale
left
the
chamber
on
the
wing
for
new
wonders
in
the
evening
emily
had
passed
some
melancholy
hours
with
madame
montoni
and
was
retiring
to
rest
when
she
was
alarmed
by
a
strange
and
loud
knocking
at
her
chamber
door
and
then
a
heavy
weight
fell
against
it
that
almost
burst
it
open
she
called
to
know
who
was
there
and
receiving
no
answer
repeated
the
call
but
a
chilling
silence
followed
it
occurred
to
herâ€”for
at
this
moment
she
could
not
reason
on
the
probability
of
circumstancesâ€”that
some
one
of
the
strangers
lately
arrived
at
the
castle
had
discovered
her
apartment
and
was
come
with
such
intent
as
their
looks
rendered
too
possibleâ€”to
rob
perhaps
to
murder
her
the
moment
she
admitted
this
possibility
terror
supplied
the
place
of
conviction
and
a
kind
of
instinctive
remembrance
of
her
remote
situation
from
the
family
heightened
it
to
a
degree
that
almost
overcame
her
senses
she
looked
at
the
door
which
led
to
the
staircase
expecting
to
see
it
open
and
listening
in
fearful
silence
for
a
return
of
the
noise
till
she
began
to
think
it
had
proceeded
from
this
door
and
a
wish
of
escaping
through
the
opposite
one
rushed
upon
her
mind
she
went
to
the
gallery
door
and
then
fearing
to
open
it
lest
some
person
might
be
silently
lurking
for
her
without
she
stopped
but
with
her
eyes
fixed
in
expectation
upon
the
opposite
door
of
the
staircase
as
thus
she
stood
she
heard
a
faint
breathing
near
her
and
became
convinced
that
some
person
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
which
was
already
locked
she
sought
for
other
fastening
but
there
was
none
while
she
yet
listened
the
breathing
was
distinctly
heard
and
her
terror
was
not
soothed
when
looking
round
her
wide
and
lonely
chamber
she
again
considered
her
remote
situation
as
she
stood
hesitating
whether
to
call
for
assistance
the
continuance
of
the
stillness
surprised
her
and
her
spirits
would
have
revived
had
she
not
continued
to
hear
the
faint
breathing
that
convinced
her
the
person
whoever
it
was
had
not
quitted
the
door
at
length
worn
out
with
anxiety
she
determined
to
call
loudly
for
assistance
from
her
casement
and
was
advancing
to
it
when
whether
the
terror
of
her
mind
gave
her
ideal
sounds
or
that
real
ones
did
come
she
thought
footsteps
were
ascending
the
private
staircase
and
expecting
to
see
its
door
unclose
she
forgot
all
other
cause
of
alarm
and
retreated
towards
the
corridor
here
she
endeavoured
to
make
her
escape
but
on
opening
the
door
was
very
near
falling
over
a
person
who
lay
on
the
floor
without
she
screamed
and
would
have
passed
but
her
trembling
frame
refused
to
support
her
and
the
moment
in
which
she
leaned
against
the
wall
of
the
gallery
allowed
her
leisure
to
observe
the
figure
before
her
and
to
recognise
the
features
of
annette
fear
instantly
yielded
to
surprise
she
spoke
in
vain
to
the
poor
girl
who
remained
senseless
on
the
floor
and
then
losing
all
consciousness
of
her
own
weakness
hurried
to
her
assistance
when
annette
recovered
she
was
helped
by
emily
into
the
chamber
but
was
still
unable
to
speak
and
looked
round
her
as
if
her
eyes
followed
some
person
in
the
room
emily
tried
to
sooth
her
disturbed
spirits
and
forbore
at
present
to
ask
her
any
questions
but
the
faculty
of
speech
was
never
long
withheld
from
annette
and
she
explained
in
broken
sentences
and
in
her
tedious
way
the
occasion
of
her
disorder
she
affirmed
and
with
a
solemnity
of
conviction
that
almost
staggered
the
incredulity
of
emily
that
she
had
seen
an
apparition
as
she
was
passing
to
her
bedroom
through
the
corridor
â€œi
had
heard
strange
stories
of
that
chamber
beforeâ€
said
annette
â€œbut
as
it
was
so
near
yours
maâ€™amselle
i
would
not
tell
them
to
you
because
they
would
frighten
you
the
servants
had
told
me
often
and
often
that
it
was
haunted
and
that
was
the
reason
why
it
was
shut
up
nay
for
that
matter
why
the
whole
string
of
these
rooms
here
are
shut
up
i
quaked
whenever
i
went
by
and
i
must
say
i
did
sometimes
think
i
heard
odd
noises
within
it
but
as
i
said
as
i
was
passing
along
the
corridor
and
not
thinking
a
word
about
the
matter
or
even
of
the
strange
voice
that
the
signors
heard
the
other
night
all
of
a
sudden
comes
a
great
light
and
looking
behind
me
there
was
a
tall
figure
i
saw
it
as
plainly
maâ€™amselle
as
i
see
you
at
this
moment
a
tall
figure
gliding
along
oh
i
cannot
describe
how
into
the
room
that
is
always
shut
up
and
nobody
has
the
key
of
it
but
the
signor
and
the
door
shut
directlyâ€
â€œthen
it
doubtless
was
the
signorâ€
said
emily
â€œo
no
maâ€™amselle
it
could
not
be
him
for
i
left
him
busy
a-quarrelling
in
my
ladyâ€™s
dressing-roomâ€
â€œyou
bring
me
strange
tales
annetteâ€
said
emily
â€œit
was
but
this
morning
that
you
would
have
terrified
me
with
the
apprehension
of
murder
and
now
you
would
persuade
me
you
have
seen
a
ghost
these
wonderful
stories
come
too
quicklyâ€
â€œnay
maâ€™amselle
i
will
say
no
more
only
if
i
had
not
been
frightened
i
should
not
have
fainted
dead
away
so
i
ran
as
fast
as
i
could
to
get
to
your
door
but
what
was
worst
of
all
i
could
not
call
out
then
i
thought
something
must
be
strangely
the
matter
with
me
and
directly
i
dropt
downâ€
â€œwas
it
the
chamber
where
the
black
veil
hangsâ€
said
emily
â€œo
no
maâ€™amselle
it
was
one
nearer
to
this
what
shall
i
do
to
get
to
my
room
i
would
not
go
out
into
the
corridor
again
for
the
whole
worldâ€
emily
whose
spirits
had
been
severely
shocked
and
who
therefore
did
not
like
the
thought
of
passing
the
night
alone
told
her
she
might
sleep
where
she
was
â€œo
no
maâ€™amselleâ€
replied
annette
â€œi
would
not
sleep
in
the
room
now
for
a
thousand
sequinsâ€
wearied
and
disappointed
emily
first
ridiculed
though
she
shared
her
fears
and
then
tried
to
sooth
them
but
neither
attempt
succeeded
and
the
girl
persisted
in
believing
and
affirming
that
what
she
had
seen
was
nothing
human
it
was
not
till
some
time
after
emily
had
recovered
her
composure
that
she
recollected
the
steps
she
had
heard
on
the
staircaseâ€”a
remembrance
however
which
made
her
insist
that
annette
should
pass
the
night
with
her
and
with
much
difficulty
she
at
length
prevailed
assisted
by
that
part
of
the
girlâ€™s
fear
which
concerned
the
corridor
early
on
the
following
morning
as
emily
crossed
the
hall
to
the
ramparts
she
heard
a
noisy
bustle
in
the
courtyard
and
the
clatter
of
horsesâ€™
hoofs
such
unusual
sounds
excited
her
curiosity
and
instead
of
going
to
the
ramparts
she
went
to
an
upper
casement
from
whence
she
saw
in
the
court
below
a
large
party
of
horsemen
dressed
in
a
singular
but
uniform
habit
and
completely
though
variously
armed
they
wore
a
kind
of
short
jacket
composed
of
black
and
scarlet
and
several
of
them
had
a
cloak
of
plain
black
which
covering
the
person
entirely
hung
down
to
the
stirrups
as
one
of
these
cloaks
glanced
aside
she
saw
beneath
daggers
apparently
of
different
sizes
tucked
into
the
horsemanâ€™s
belt
she
further
observed
that
these
were
carried
in
the
same
manner
by
many
of
the
horsemen
without
cloaks
most
of
whom
bore
also
pikes
or
javelins
on
their
heads
were
the
small
italian
caps
some
of
which
were
distinguished
by
black
feathers
whether
these
caps
gave
a
fierce
air
to
the
countenance
or
that
the
countenances
they
surmounted
had
naturally
such
an
appearance
emily
thought
she
had
never
till
then
seen
an
assemblage
of
faces
so
savage
and
terrific
while
she
gazed
she
almost
fancied
herself
surrounded
by
banditti
and
a
vague
thought
glanced
athwart
her
fancyâ€”that
montoni
was
the
captain
of
the
group
before
her
and
that
this
castle
was
to
be
the
place
of
rendezvous
the
strange
and
horrible
supposition
was
but
momentary
though
her
reason
could
supply
none
more
probable
and
though
she
discovered
among
the
band
the
strangers
she
had
formerly
noticed
with
so
much
alarm
who
were
now
distinguished
by
the
black
plume
while
she
continued
gazing
cavigni
verezzi
and
bertolini
came
forth
from
the
hall
habited
like
the
rest
except
that
they
wore
hats
with
a
mixed
plume
of
black
and
scarlet
and
that
their
arms
differed
from
those
of
the
rest
of
the
party
as
they
mounted
their
horses
emily
was
struck
with
the
exulting
joy
expressed
on
the
visage
of
verezzi
while
cavigni
was
gay
yet
with
a
shade
of
thought
on
his
countenance
and
as
he
managed
his
horse
with
dexterity
his
graceful
and
commanding
figure
which
exhibited
the
majesty
of
a
hero
had
never
appeared
to
more
advantage
emily
as
she
observed
him
thought
he
somewhat
resembled
valancourt
in
the
spirit
and
dignity
of
his
person
but
she
looked
in
vain
for
the
noble
benevolent
countenanceâ€”the
soulâ€™s
intelligence
which
overspread
the
features
of
the
latter
as
she
was
hoping
she
scarcely
knew
why
that
montoni
would
accompany
the
party
he
appeared
at
the
hall
door
but
un-accoutred
having
carefully
observed
the
horsemen
conversed
awhile
with
the
cavaliers
and
bidden
them
farewell
the
band
wheeled
round
the
court
and
led
by
verezzi
issued
forth
under
the
portcullis
montoni
following
to
the
portal
and
gazing
after
them
for
some
time
emily
then
retired
from
the
casement
and
now
certain
of
being
unmolested
went
to
walk
on
the
ramparts
from
whence
she
soon
after
saw
the
party
winding
among
the
mountains
to
the
west
appearing
and
disappearing
between
the
woods
till
distance
confused
their
figures
consolidated
their
numbers
and
only
a
dingy
mass
appeared
moving
along
the
heights
emily
observed
that
no
workmen
were
on
the
ramparts
and
that
the
repairs
of
the
fortifications
seemed
to
be
completed
while
she
sauntered
thoughtfully
on
she
heard
distant
footsteps
and
raising
her
eyes
saw
several
men
lurking
under
the
castle
walls
who
were
evidently
not
workmen
but
looked
as
if
they
would
have
accorded
well
with
the
party
which
was
gone
wondering
where
annette
had
hid
herself
so
long
who
might
have
explained
some
of
the
late
circumstances
and
then
considering
that
madame
montoni
was
probably
risen
she
went
to
her
dressing-room
where
she
mentioned
what
had
occurred
but
madame
montoni
either
would
not
or
could
not
give
any
explanation
of
the
event
the
signorâ€™s
reserve
to
his
wife
on
this
subject
was
probably
nothing
more
than
usual
yet
to
emily
it
gave
an
air
of
mystery
to
the
whole
affair
that
seemed
to
hint
there
was
danger
if
not
villany
in
his
schemes
annette
presently
came
and
as
usual
was
full
of
alarm
to
her
ladyâ€™s
eager
enquiries
of
what
she
had
heard
among
the
servants
she
replied
â€œah
madam
nobody
knows
what
it
is
all
about
but
old
carlo
he
knows
well
enough
i
dare
say
but
he
is
as
close
as
his
master
some
say
the
signor
is
going
out
to
frighten
the
enemy
as
they
call
it
but
where
is
the
enemy
then
others
say
he
is
going
to
take
away
somebodyâ€™s
castle
but
i
am
sure
he
has
room
enough
in
his
own
without
taking
other
peopleâ€™s
and
i
am
sure
i
should
like
it
a
great
deal
better
if
there
were
more
people
to
fill
itâ€
â€œah
you
will
soon
have
your
wish
i
fearâ€
replied
madame
montoni
â€œno
madam
but
such
ill-looking
fellows
are
not
worth
having
i
mean
such
gallant
smart
merry
fellows
as
ludovico
who
is
always
telling
droll
stories
to
make
one
laugh
it
was
but
yesterday
he
told
me
such
a
humoursome
tale
i
canâ€™t
help
laughing
at
it
nowâ€”says
heâ€”â€
â€œwell
we
can
dispense
with
the
storyâ€
said
her
lady
â€œahâ€
continued
annette
â€œhe
sees
a
great
way
further
than
other
people
now
he
sees
into
all
the
signorâ€™s
meaning
without
knowing
a
word
about
the
matterâ€
â€œhow
is
thatâ€
said
madame
montoni
â€œwhy
he
saysâ€”but
he
made
me
promise
not
to
tell
and
i
would
not
disoblige
him
for
the
worldâ€
â€œwhat
is
it
he
made
you
promise
not
to
tellâ€
said
her
lady
sternly
â€œi
insist
upon
knowing
immediatelyâ€”what
is
it
he
made
you
promiseâ€
â€œo
madamâ€
cried
annette
â€œi
would
not
tell
for
the
universeâ€
â€œi
insist
upon
your
telling
this
instantâ€
said
madame
montoni
â€œo
dear
madam
i
would
not
tell
for
a
hundred
sequins
you
would
not
have
me
forswear
myself
madamâ€
exclaimed
annette
â€œi
will
not
wait
another
momentâ€
said
madame
montoni
annette
was
silent
â€œthe
signor
shall
be
informed
of
this
directlyâ€
rejoined
her
mistress
â€œhe
will
make
you
discover
allâ€
â€œit
is
ludovico
who
has
discoveredâ€
said
annette
â€œbut
for
mercyâ€™s
sake
madam
donâ€™t
tell
the
signor
and
you
shall
know
all
directlyâ€
madame
montoni
said
that
she
would
not
â€œwell
then
madam
ludovico
says
that
the
signor
my
master
isâ€”isâ€”that
is
he
only
thinks
so
and
anybody
you
know
madam
is
free
to
thinkâ€”that
the
signor
my
master
isâ€”isâ€”â€
â€œis
whatâ€
said
her
lady
impatiently
â€œthat
the
signor
my
master
is
going
to
beâ€”a
great
robberâ€”that
isâ€”he
is
going
to
rob
on
his
own
accountâ€”to
be
but
i
am
sure
i
donâ€™t
understand
what
he
means
to
be
aâ€”captain
ofâ€”robbersâ€
â€œart
thou
in
thy
senses
annetteâ€
said
madame
montoni
â€œor
is
this
a
trick
to
deceive
me
tell
me
this
instant
what
ludovico
did
say
to
theeâ€”no
equivocationâ€”this
instantâ€
â€œnay
madamâ€
cried
annette
â€œif
this
is
all
i
am
to
get
for
having
told
the
secretâ€”â€
her
mistress
thus
continued
to
insist
and
annette
to
protest
till
montoni
himself
appeared
who
bade
the
latter
leave
the
room
and
she
withdrew
trembling
for
the
fate
of
her
story
emily
also
was
retiring
but
her
aunt
desired
she
would
stay
and
montoni
had
so
often
made
her
a
witness
of
their
contention
that
he
no
longer
had
scruples
on
that
account
â€œi
insist
upon
knowing
this
instant
signor
what
all
this
meansâ€
said
his
wifeâ€”â€œwhat
are
all
these
armed
men
whom
they
tell
me
of
gone
out
aboutâ€
montoni
answered
her
only
with
a
look
of
scorn
and
emily
whispered
something
to
her
â€œit
does
not
signifyâ€
said
her
aunt
â€œi
will
know
and
i
will
know
too
what
the
castle
has
been
fortified
forâ€
â€œcome
comeâ€
said
montoni
â€œother
business
brought
me
here
i
must
be
trifled
with
no
longer
i
have
immediate
occasion
for
what
i
demandâ€”those
estates
must
be
given
up
without
further
contention
or
i
may
find
a
wayâ€”â€
â€œthey
never
shall
be
given
upâ€
interrupted
madame
montoni
â€œthey
never
shall
enable
you
to
carry
on
your
wild
schemesâ€”but
what
are
these
i
will
know
do
you
expect
the
castle
to
be
attacked
do
you
expect
enemies
am
i
to
be
shut
up
here
to
be
killed
in
a
siegeâ€
â€œsign
the
writingsâ€
said
montoni
â€œand
you
shall
know
moreâ€
â€œwhat
enemy
can
be
comingâ€
continued
his
wife
â€œhave
you
entered
into
the
service
of
the
state
am
i
to
be
blocked
up
here
to
dieâ€
â€œthat
may
possibly
happenâ€
said
montoni
â€œunless
you
yield
to
my
demand
for
come
what
may
you
shall
not
quit
the
castle
till
thenâ€
madame
montoni
burst
into
loud
lamentation
which
she
as
suddenly
checked
considering
that
her
husbandâ€™s
assertions
might
be
only
artifices
employed
to
extort
her
consent
she
hinted
this
suspicion
and
in
the
next
moment
told
him
also
that
his
designs
were
not
so
honourable
as
to
serve
the
state
and
that
she
believed
he
had
only
commenced
a
captain
of
banditti
to
join
the
enemies
of
venice
in
plundering
and
laying
waste
the
surrounding
country
montoni
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
with
a
steady
and
stern
countenance
while
emily
trembled
and
his
wife
for
once
thought
she
had
said
too
much
â€œyou
shall
be
removed
this
nightâ€
said
he
â€œto
the
east
turret
there
perhaps
you
may
understand
the
danger
of
offending
a
man
who
has
an
unlimited
power
over
youâ€
emily
now
fell
at
his
feet
and
with
tears
of
terror
supplicated
for
her
aunt
who
sat
trembling
with
fear
and
indignation
now
ready
to
pour
forth
execrations
and
now
to
join
the
intercessions
of
emily
montoni
however
soon
interrupted
these
entreaties
with
a
horrible
oath
and
as
he
burst
from
emily
leaving
his
cloak
in
her
hand
she
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
force
that
occasioned
her
a
severe
blow
on
the
forehead
but
he
quitted
the
room
without
attempting
to
raise
her
whose
attention
was
called
from
herself
by
a
deep
groan
from
madame
montoni
who
continued
otherwise
unmoved
in
her
chair
and
had
not
fainted
emily
hastening
to
her
assistance
saw
her
eyes
rolling
and
her
features
convulsed
having
spoken
to
her
without
receiving
an
answer
she
brought
water
and
supported
her
head
while
she
held
it
to
her
lips
but
the
increasing
convulsions
soon
compelled
emily
to
call
for
assistance
on
her
way
through
the
hall
in
search
of
annette
she
met
montoni
whom
she
told
what
had
happened
and
conjured
to
return
and
comfort
her
aunt
but
he
turned
silently
away
with
a
look
of
indifference
and
went
out
upon
the
ramparts
at
length
she
found
old
carlo
and
annette
and
they
hastened
to
the
dressing-room
where
madame
montoni
had
fallen
on
the
floor
and
was
lying
in
strong
convulsions
having
lifted
her
into
the
adjoining
room
and
laid
her
on
the
bed
the
force
of
her
disorder
still
made
all
their
strength
necessary
to
hold
her
while
annette
trembled
and
sobbed
and
old
carlo
looked
silently
and
piteously
on
as
his
feeble
hands
grasped
those
of
his
mistress
till
turning
his
eyes
upon
emily
he
exclaimed
â€œgood
god
signora
what
is
the
matterâ€
emily
looked
calmly
at
him
and
saw
his
enquiring
eyes
fixed
on
her
and
annette
looking
up
screamed
loudly
for
emilyâ€™s
face
was
stained
with
blood
which
continued
to
fall
slowly
from
her
forehead
but
her
attention
had
been
so
entirely
occupied
by
the
scene
before
her
that
she
had
felt
no
pain
from
the
wound
she
now
held
a
handkerchief
to
her
face
and
notwithstanding
her
faintness
continued
to
watch
madame
montoni
the
violence
of
whose
convulsions
was
abating
till
at
length
they
ceased
and
left
her
in
a
kind
of
stupor
â€œmy
aunt
must
remain
quietâ€
said
emily
â€œgo
good
carlo
if
we
should
want
your
assistance
i
will
send
for
you
in
the
mean
time
if
you
have
an
opportunity
speak
kindly
of
your
mistress
to
your
masterâ€
â€œalasâ€
said
carlo
â€œi
have
seen
too
much
i
have
little
influence
with
the
signor
but
do
dear
young
lady
take
some
care
of
yourself
that
is
an
ugly
wound
and
you
look
sadlyâ€
â€œthank
you
my
friend
for
your
considerationâ€
said
emily
smiling
kindly
â€œthe
wound
is
trifling
it
came
by
a
fallâ€
carlo
shook
his
head
and
left
the
room
and
emily
with
annette
continued
to
watch
by
her
aunt
â€œdid
my
lady
tell
the
signor
what
ludovico
said
maâ€™amselleâ€
asked
annette
in
a
whisper
but
emily
quieted
her
fears
on
the
subject
â€œi
thought
what
this
quarrelling
would
come
toâ€
continued
annette
â€œi
suppose
the
signor
has
been
beating
my
ladyâ€
â€œno
no
annette
you
are
totally
mistaken
nothing
extraordinary
has
happenedâ€
â€œwhy
extraordinary
things
happen
here
so
often
maâ€™amselle
that
there
is
nothing
in
them
here
is
another
legion
of
those
ill-looking
fellows
come
to
the
castle
this
morningâ€
â€œhush
annette
you
will
disturb
my
aunt
we
will
talk
of
that
by
and
byeâ€
they
continued
watching
silently
till
madame
montoni
uttered
a
low
sigh
when
emily
took
her
hand
and
spoke
soothingly
to
her
but
the
former
gazed
with
unconscious
eyes
and
it
was
long
before
she
knew
her
niece
her
first
words
then
enquired
for
montoni
to
which
emily
replied
by
an
entreaty
that
she
would
compose
her
spirits
and
consent
to
be
kept
quiet
adding
that
if
she
wished
any
message
to
be
conveyed
to
him
she
would
herself
deliver
it
â€œnoâ€
said
her
aunt
faintly
â€œnoâ€”i
have
nothing
new
to
tell
him
does
he
persist
in
saying
i
shall
be
removed
from
my
chamberâ€
emily
replied
that
he
had
not
spoken
on
the
subject
since
madame
montoni
heard
him
and
then
she
tried
to
divert
her
attention
to
some
other
topic
but
her
aunt
seemed
to
be
inattentive
to
what
she
said
and
lost
in
secret
thoughts
emily
having
brought
her
some
refreshment
now
left
her
to
the
care
of
annette
and
went
in
search
of
montoni
whom
she
found
on
a
remote
part
of
the
rampart
conversing
among
a
group
of
the
men
described
by
annette
they
stood
round
him
with
fierce
yet
subjugated
looks
while
he
speaking
earnestly
and
pointing
to
the
walls
did
not
perceive
emily
who
remained
at
some
distance
waiting
till
he
should
be
at
leisure
and
observing
involuntarily
the
appearance
of
one
man
more
savage
than
his
fellows
who
stood
resting
on
his
pike
and
looking
over
the
shoulders
of
a
comrade
at
montoni
to
whom
he
listened
with
uncommon
earnestness
this
man
was
apparently
of
low
condition
yet
his
looks
appeared
not
to
acknowledge
the
superiority
of
montoni
as
did
those
of
his
companions
and
sometimes
they
even
assumed
an
air
of
authority
which
the
decisive
manner
of
the
signor
could
not
repress
some
few
words
of
montoni
then
passed
in
the
wind
and
as
the
men
were
separating
she
heard
him
say
â€œthis
evening
then
begin
the
watch
at
sunsetâ€
â€œat
sunset
signorâ€
replied
one
or
two
of
them
and
walked
away
while
emily
approached
montoni
who
appeared
desirous
of
avoiding
her
but
though
she
observed
this
she
had
courage
to
proceed
she
endeavoured
to
intercede
once
more
for
her
aunt
represented
to
him
her
sufferings
and
urged
the
danger
of
exposing
her
to
a
cold
apartment
in
her
present
state
â€œshe
suffers
by
her
own
follyâ€
said
montoni
â€œand
is
not
to
be
pitiedâ€”she
knows
how
she
may
avoid
these
sufferings
in
futureâ€”if
she
is
removed
to
the
turret
it
will
be
her
own
fault
let
her
be
obedient
and
sign
the
writings
you
heard
of
and
i
will
think
no
more
of
itâ€
when
emily
ventured
still
to
plead
he
sternly
silenced
and
rebuked
her
for
interfering
in
his
domestic
affairs
but
at
length
dismissed
her
with
this
concessionâ€”that
he
would
not
remove
madame
montoni
on
the
ensuing
night
but
allow
her
till
the
next
to
consider
whether
she
would
resign
her
settlements
or
be
imprisoned
in
the
east
turret
of
the
castle
â€œwhere
she
shall
findâ€
he
added
â€œa
punishment
she
may
not
expectâ€
emily
then
hastened
to
inform
her
aunt
of
this
short
respite
and
of
the
alternative
that
awaited
her
to
which
the
latter
made
no
reply
but
appeared
thoughtful
while
emily
in
consideration
of
her
extreme
languor
wished
to
sooth
her
mind
by
leading
it
to
less
interesting
topics
and
though
these
efforts
were
unsuccessful
and
madame
montoni
became
peevish
her
resolution
on
the
contended
point
seemed
somewhat
to
relax
and
emily
recommended
as
her
only
means
of
safety
that
she
should
submit
to
montoniâ€™s
demand
â€œyou
know
not
what
you
adviseâ€
said
her
aunt
â€œdo
you
understand
that
these
estates
will
descend
to
you
at
my
death
if
i
persist
in
a
refusalâ€
â€œi
was
ignorant
of
that
circumstance
madamâ€
replied
emily
â€œbut
the
knowledge
of
it
cannot
withhold
me
from
advising
you
to
adopt
the
conduct
which
not
only
your
peace
but
i
fear
your
safety
requires
and
i
entreat
that
you
will
not
suffer
a
consideration
comparatively
so
trifling
to
make
you
hesitate
a
moment
in
resigning
themâ€
â€œare
you
sincere
nieceâ€
â€œis
it
possible
you
can
doubt
it
madamâ€
her
aunt
appeared
to
be
affected
â€œyou
are
not
unworthy
of
these
estates
nieceâ€
said
she
â€œi
would
wish
to
keep
them
for
your
sakeâ€”you
show
a
virtue
i
did
not
expectâ€
â€œhow
have
i
deserved
this
reproof
madamâ€
said
emily
sorrowfully
â€œreproofâ€
replied
madame
montoni
â€œi
meant
to
praise
your
virtueâ€
â€œalas
here
is
no
exertion
of
virtueâ€
rejoined
emily
â€œfor
here
is
no
temptation
to
be
overcomeâ€
â€œyet
monsieur
valancourtâ€”â€
said
her
aunt
â€œo
madamâ€
interrupted
emily
anticipating
what
she
would
have
said
â€œdo
not
let
me
glance
on
that
subject
do
not
let
my
mind
be
stained
with
a
wish
so
shockingly
self-interestedâ€
she
immediately
changed
the
topic
and
continued
with
madame
montoni
till
she
withdrew
to
her
apartment
for
the
night
at
that
hour
the
castle
was
perfectly
still
and
every
inhabitant
of
it
except
herself
seemed
to
have
retired
to
rest
as
she
passed
along
the
wide
and
lonely
galleries
dusky
and
silent
she
felt
forlorn
and
apprehensive
ofâ€”she
scarcely
knew
what
but
when
entering
the
corridor
she
recollected
the
incident
of
the
preceding
night
a
dread
seized
her
lest
a
subject
of
alarm
similar
to
that
which
had
befallen
annette
should
occur
to
her
and
which
whether
real
or
ideal
would
she
felt
have
an
almost
equal
effect
upon
her
weakened
spirits
the
chamber
to
which
annette
had
alluded
she
did
not
exactly
know
but
understood
it
to
be
one
of
those
she
must
pass
in
the
way
to
her
own
and
sending
a
fearful
look
forward
into
the
gloom
she
stepped
lightly
and
cautiously
along
till
coming
to
a
door
from
whence
issued
a
low
sound
she
hesitated
and
paused
and
during
the
delay
of
that
moment
her
fears
so
much
increased
that
she
had
no
power
to
move
from
the
spot
believing
that
she
heard
a
human
voice
within
she
was
somewhat
revived
but
in
the
next
moment
the
door
was
opened
and
a
person
whom
she
conceived
to
be
montoni
appeared
who
instantly
started
back
and
closed
it
though
not
before
she
had
seen
by
the
light
that
burned
in
the
chamber
another
person
sitting
in
a
melancholy
attitude
by
the
fire
her
terror
vanished
but
her
astonishment
only
began
which
was
now
roused
by
the
mysterious
secrecy
of
montoniâ€™s
manner
and
by
the
discovery
of
a
person
whom
he
thus
visited
at
midnight
in
an
apartment
which
had
long
been
shut
up
and
of
which
such
extraordinary
reports
were
circulated
while
she
thus
continued
hesitating
strongly
prompted
to
watch
montoniâ€™s
motions
yet
fearing
to
irritate
him
by
appearing
to
notice
them
the
door
was
again
opened
cautiously
and
as
instantly
closed
as
before
she
then
stepped
softly
to
her
chamber
which
was
the
next
but
one
to
this
but
having
put
down
her
lamp
returned
to
an
obscure
corner
of
the
corridor
to
observe
the
proceedings
of
this
half-seen
person
and
to
ascertain
whether
it
was
indeed
montoni
having
waited
in
silent
expectation
for
a
few
minutes
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
it
was
again
opened
and
the
same
person
appeared
whom
she
now
knew
to
be
montoni
he
looked
cautiously
round
without
perceiving
her
then
stepping
forward
closed
the
door
and
left
the
corridor
soon
after
emily
heard
the
door
fastened
on
the
inside
and
she
withdrew
to
her
chamber
wondering
at
what
she
had
witnessed
it
was
now
twelve
oâ€™clock
as
she
closed
her
casement
she
heard
footsteps
on
the
terrace
below
and
saw
imperfectly
through
the
gloom
several
persons
advancing
who
passed
under
the
casement
she
then
heard
the
clink
of
arms
and
in
the
next
moment
the
watch-word
when
recollecting
the
command
she
had
overheard
from
montoni
and
the
hour
of
the
night
she
understood
that
these
men
were
for
the
first
time
relieving
guard
in
the
castle
having
listened
till
all
was
again
still
she
retired
to
sleep
and
shall
no
lay
of
death
with
pleasing
murmur
sooth
her
parted
soul
shall
no
tear
wet
her
grave
sayers
on
the
following
morning
emily
went
early
to
the
apartment
of
madame
montoni
who
had
slept
well
and
was
much
recovered
her
spirits
had
also
returned
with
her
health
and
her
resolution
to
oppose
montoniâ€™s
demands
revived
though
it
yet
struggled
with
her
fears
which
emily
who
trembled
for
the
consequence
of
further
opposition
endeavoured
to
confirm
her
aunt
as
has
been
already
shown
had
a
disposition
which
delighted
in
contradiction
and
which
taught
her
when
unpleasant
circumstances
were
offered
to
her
understanding
not
to
enquire
into
their
truth
but
to
seek
for
arguments
by
which
she
might
make
them
appear
false
long
habit
had
so
entirely
confirmed
this
natural
propensity
that
she
was
not
conscious
of
possessing
it
emilyâ€™s
remonstrances
and
representations
therefore
roused
her
pride
instead
of
alarming
or
convincing
her
judgment
and
she
still
relied
upon
the
discovery
of
some
means
by
which
she
might
yet
avoid
submitting
to
the
demand
of
her
husband
considering
that
if
she
could
once
escape
from
his
castle
she
might
defy
his
power
and
obtaining
a
decisive
separation
live
in
comfort
on
the
estates
that
yet
remained
for
her
she
mentioned
this
to
her
niece
who
accorded
with
her
in
the
wish
but
differed
from
her
as
to
the
probability
of
its
completion
she
represented
the
impossibility
of
passing
the
gates
secured
and
guarded
as
they
were
and
the
extreme
danger
of
committing
her
design
to
the
discretion
of
a
servant
who
might
either
purposely
betray
or
accidentally
disclose
itâ€”montoniâ€™s
vengeance
would
also
disdain
restraint
if
her
intention
was
detected
and
though
emily
wished
as
fervently
as
she
could
do
to
regain
her
freedom
and
return
to
france
she
consulted
only
madame
montoniâ€™s
safety
and
persevered
in
advising
her
to
relinquish
her
settlement
without
braving
further
outrage
the
struggle
of
contrary
emotions
however
continued
to
rage
in
her
auntâ€™s
bosom
and
she
still
brooded
over
the
chance
of
effecting
an
escape
while
she
thus
sat
montoni
entered
the
room
and
without
noticing
his
wifeâ€™s
indisposition
said
that
he
came
to
remind
her
of
the
impolicy
of
trifling
with
him
and
that
he
gave
her
only
till
the
evening
to
determine
whether
she
would
consent
to
his
demand
or
compel
him
by
a
refusal
to
remove
her
to
the
east
turret
he
added
that
a
party
of
cavaliers
would
dine
with
him
that
day
and
that
he
expected
that
she
would
sit
at
the
head
of
the
table
where
emily
also
must
be
present
madame
montoni
was
now
on
the
point
of
uttering
an
absolute
refusal
but
suddenly
considering
that
her
liberty
during
this
entertainment
though
circumscribed
might
favour
her
further
plans
she
acquiesced
with
seeming
reluctance
and
montoni
soon
after
left
the
apartment
his
command
struck
emily
with
surprise
and
apprehension
who
shrank
from
the
thought
of
being
exposed
to
the
gaze
of
strangers
such
as
her
fancy
represented
these
to
be
and
the
words
of
count
morano
now
again
recollected
did
not
sooth
her
fears
when
she
withdrew
to
prepare
for
dinner
she
dressed
herself
with
even
more
simplicity
than
usual
that
she
might
escape
observationâ€”a
policy
which
did
not
avail
her
for
as
she
repassed
to
her
auntâ€™s
apartment
she
was
met
by
montoni
who
censured
what
he
called
her
prudish
appearance
and
insisted
that
she
should
wear
the
most
splendid
dress
she
had
even
that
which
had
been
prepared
for
her
intended
nuptials
with
count
morano
and
which
it
now
appeared
her
aunt
had
carefully
brought
with
her
from
venice
this
was
made
not
in
the
venetian
but
in
the
neapolitan
fashion
so
as
to
set
off
the
shape
and
figure
to
the
utmost
advantage
in
it
her
beautiful
chestnut
tresses
were
negligently
bound
up
in
pearls
and
suffered
to
fall
back
again
on
her
neck
the
simplicity
of
a
better
taste
than
madame
montoniâ€™s
was
conspicuous
in
this
dress
splendid
as
it
was
and
emilyâ€™s
unaffected
beauty
never
had
appeared
more
captivatingly
she
had
now
only
to
hope
that
montoniâ€™s
order
was
prompted
not
by
any
extraordinary
design
but
by
an
ostentation
of
displaying
his
family
richly
attired
to
the
eyes
of
strangers
yet
nothing
less
than
his
absolute
command
could
have
prevailed
with
her
to
wear
a
dress
that
had
been
designed
for
such
an
offensive
purpose
much
less
to
have
worn
it
on
this
occasion
as
she
descended
to
dinner
the
emotion
of
her
mind
threw
a
faint
blush
over
her
countenance
and
heightened
its
interesting
expression
for
timidity
had
made
her
linger
in
her
apartment
till
the
utmost
moment
and
when
she
entered
the
hall
in
which
a
kind
of
state
dinner
was
spread
montoni
and
his
guests
were
already
seated
at
the
table
she
was
then
going
to
place
herself
by
her
aunt
but
montoni
waved
his
hand
and
two
of
the
cavaliers
rose
and
seated
her
between
them
the
eldest
of
these
was
a
tall
man
with
strong
italian
features
an
aquiline
nose
and
dark
penetrating
eyes
that
flashed
with
fire
when
his
mind
was
agitated
and
even
in
its
state
of
rest
retained
somewhat
of
the
wildness
of
the
passions
his
visage
was
long
and
narrow
and
his
complexion
of
a
sickly
yellow
the
other
who
appeared
to
be
about
forty
had
features
of
a
different
cast
yet
italian
and
his
look
was
slow
subtle
and
penetrating
his
eyes
of
a
dark
grey
were
small
and
hollow
his
complexion
was
a
sun-burnt
brown
and
the
contour
of
his
face
though
inclined
to
oval
was
irregular
and
ill-formed
eight
other
guests
sat
round
the
table
who
were
all
dressed
in
a
uniform
and
had
all
an
expression
more
or
less
of
wild
fierceness
of
subtle
design
or
of
licentious
passions
as
emily
timidly
surveyed
them
she
remembered
the
scene
of
the
preceding
morning
and
again
almost
fancied
herself
surrounded
by
banditti
then
looking
back
to
the
tranquillity
of
her
early
life
she
felt
scarcely
less
astonishment
than
grief
at
her
present
situation
the
scene
in
which
they
sat
assisted
the
illusion
it
was
an
ancient
hall
gloomy
from
the
style
of
its
architecture
from
its
great
extent
and
because
almost
the
only
light
it
received
was
from
one
large
gothic
window
and
from
a
pair
of
folding
doors
which
being
open
admitted
likewise
a
view
of
the
west
rampart
with
the
wild
mountains
of
the
apennine
beyond
the
middle
compartment
of
this
hall
rose
into
a
vaulted
roof
enriched
with
fretwork
and
supported
on
three
sides
by
pillars
of
marble
beyond
these
long
colonnades
retired
in
gloomy
grandeur
till
their
extent
was
lost
in
twilight
the
lightest
footsteps
of
the
servants
as
they
advanced
through
these
were
returned
in
whispering
echoes
and
their
figures
seen
at
a
distance
imperfectly
through
the
dusk
frequently
awakened
emilyâ€™s
imagination
she
looked
alternately
at
montoni
at
his
guests
and
on
the
surrounding
scene
and
then
remembering
her
dear
native
province
her
pleasant
home
and
the
simplicity
and
goodness
of
the
friends
whom
she
had
lost
grief
and
surprise
again
occupied
her
mind
when
her
thoughts
could
return
from
these
considerations
she
fancied
she
observed
an
air
of
authority
towards
his
guests
such
as
she
had
never
before
seen
him
assume
though
he
had
always
been
distinguished
by
a
haughty
carriage
there
was
something
also
in
the
manners
of
the
strangers
that
seemed
perfectly
though
not
servilely
to
acknowledge
his
superiority
during
dinner
the
conversation
was
chiefly
on
war
and
politics
they
talked
with
energy
of
the
state
of
venice
its
dangers
the
character
of
the
reigning
doge
and
of
the
chief
senators
and
then
spoke
of
the
state
of
rome
when
the
repast
was
over
they
rose
and
each
filling
his
goblet
with
wine
from
the
gilded
ewer
that
stood
beside
him
drank
â€œsuccess
to
our
exploitsâ€
montoni
was
lifting
his
goblet
to
his
lips
to
drink
this
toast
when
suddenly
the
wine
hissed
rose
to
the
brim
and
as
he
held
the
glass
from
him
it
burst
into
a
thousand
pieces
to
him
who
constantly
used
that
sort
of
venice
glass
which
had
the
quality
of
breaking
upon
receiving
poisoned
liquor
a
suspicion
that
some
of
his
guests
had
endeavoured
to
betray
him
instantly
occurred
and
he
ordered
all
the
gates
to
be
closed
drew
his
sword
and
looking
round
on
them
who
stood
in
silent
amazement
exclaimed
â€œhere
is
a
traitor
among
us
let
those
that
are
innocent
assist
in
discovering
the
guiltyâ€
indignation
flashed
from
the
eyes
of
the
cavaliers
who
all
drew
their
swords
and
madame
montoni
terrified
at
what
might
ensue
was
hastening
from
the
hall
when
her
husband
commanded
her
to
stay
but
his
further
words
could
not
now
be
distinguished
for
the
voice
of
every
person
rose
together
his
order
that
all
the
servants
should
appear
was
at
length
obeyed
and
they
declared
their
ignorance
of
any
deceitâ€”a
protestation
which
could
not
be
believed
for
it
was
evident
that
as
montoniâ€™s
liquor
and
his
only
had
been
poisoned
a
deliberate
design
had
been
formed
against
his
life
which
could
not
have
been
carried
so
far
towards
its
accomplishment
without
the
connivance
of
the
servant
who
had
the
care
of
the
wine
ewers
this
man
with
another
whose
face
betrayed
either
the
consciousness
of
guilt
or
the
fear
of
punishment
montoni
ordered
to
be
chained
instantly
and
confined
in
a
strong
room
which
had
formerly
been
used
as
a
prison
thither
likewise
he
would
have
sent
all
his
guests
had
he
not
foreseen
the
consequence
of
so
bold
and
unjustifiable
a
proceeding
as
to
those
therefore
he
contented
himself
with
swearing
that
no
man
should
pass
the
gates
till
this
extraordinary
affair
had
been
investigated
and
then
sternly
bade
his
wife
retire
to
her
apartment
whither
he
suffered
emily
to
attend
her
in
about
half
an
hour
he
followed
to
the
dressing-room
and
emily
observed
with
horror
his
dark
countenance
and
quivering
lip
and
heard
him
denounce
vengeance
on
her
aunt
â€œit
will
avail
you
nothingâ€
said
he
to
his
wife
â€œto
deny
the
fact
i
have
proof
of
your
guilt
your
only
chance
of
mercy
rests
on
a
full
confessionâ€”there
is
nothing
to
hope
from
sullenness
or
falsehood
your
accomplice
has
confessed
allâ€
emilyâ€™s
fainting
spirits
were
roused
by
astonishment
as
she
heard
her
aunt
accused
of
a
crime
so
atrocious
and
she
could
not
for
a
moment
admit
the
possibility
of
her
guilt
meanwhile
madame
montoniâ€™s
agitation
did
not
permit
her
to
reply
alternately
her
complexion
varied
from
livid
paleness
to
a
crimson
flush
and
she
trembledâ€”but
whether
with
fear
or
with
indignation
it
were
difficult
to
decide
â€œspare
your
wordsâ€
said
montoni
seeing
her
about
to
speak
â€œyour
countenance
makes
full
confession
of
your
crimeâ€”you
shall
be
instantly
removed
to
the
east
turretâ€
â€œthis
accusationâ€
said
madame
montoni
speaking
with
difficulty
â€œis
used
only
as
an
excuse
for
your
cruelty
i
disdain
to
reply
to
it
you
do
not
believe
me
guiltyâ€
â€œsignorâ€
said
emily
solemnly
â€œthis
dreadful
charge
i
would
answer
with
my
life
is
false
nay
signorâ€
she
added
observing
the
severity
of
his
countenance
â€œthis
is
no
moment
for
restraint
on
my
part
i
do
not
scruple
to
tell
you
that
you
are
deceivedâ€”most
wickedly
deceived
by
the
suggestion
of
some
person
who
aims
at
the
ruin
of
my
auntâ€”it
is
impossible
that
you
could
yourself
have
imagined
a
crime
so
hideousâ€
montoni
his
lips
trembling
more
than
before
replied
only
â€œif
you
value
your
own
safetyâ€
addressing
emily
â€œyou
will
be
silent
i
shall
know
how
to
interpret
your
remonstrances
should
you
persevere
in
themâ€
emily
raised
her
eyes
calmly
to
heaven
â€œhere
is
indeed
then
nothing
to
hopeâ€
said
she
â€œpeaceâ€
cried
montoni
â€œor
you
shall
find
there
is
something
to
fearâ€
he
turned
to
his
wife
who
had
now
recovered
her
spirits
and
who
vehemently
and
wildly
remonstrated
upon
this
mysterious
suspicion
but
montoniâ€™s
rage
heightened
with
her
indignation
and
emily
dreading
the
event
of
it
threw
herself
between
them
and
clasped
his
knees
in
silence
looking
up
in
his
face
with
an
expression
that
might
have
softened
the
heart
of
a
fiend
whether
his
was
hardened
by
a
conviction
of
madame
montoniâ€™s
guilt
or
that
a
bare
suspicion
of
it
made
him
eager
to
exercise
vengeance
he
was
totally
and
alike
insensible
to
the
distress
of
his
wife
and
to
the
pleading
looks
of
emily
whom
he
made
no
attempt
to
raise
but
was
vehemently
menacing
both
when
he
was
called
out
of
the
room
by
some
person
at
the
door
as
he
shut
the
door
emily
heard
him
turn
the
lock
and
take
out
the
key
so
that
madame
montoni
and
herself
were
now
prisoners
and
she
saw
that
his
designs
became
more
and
more
terrible
her
endeavours
to
explain
his
motives
for
this
circumstance
were
almost
as
ineffectual
as
those
to
sooth
the
distress
of
her
aunt
whose
innocence
she
could
not
doubt
but
she
at
length
accounted
for
montoniâ€™s
readiness
to
suspect
his
wife
by
his
own
consciousness
of
cruelty
towards
her
and
for
the
sudden
violence
of
his
present
conduct
against
both
before
even
his
suspicions
could
be
completely
formed
by
his
general
eagerness
to
effect
suddenly
whatever
he
was
led
to
desire
and
his
carelessness
of
justice
or
humanity
in
accomplishing
it
madame
montoni
after
some
time
again
looked
round
in
search
of
a
possibility
of
escape
from
the
castle
and
conversed
with
emily
on
the
subject
who
was
now
willing
to
encounter
any
hazard
though
she
forbore
to
encourage
a
hope
in
her
aunt
which
she
herself
did
not
admit
how
strongly
the
edifice
was
secured
and
how
vigilantly
guarded
she
knew
too
well
and
trembled
to
commit
their
safety
to
the
caprice
of
the
servant
whose
assistance
they
must
solicit
old
carlo
was
compassionate
but
he
seemed
to
be
too
much
in
his
masterâ€™s
interest
to
be
trusted
by
them
annette
could
of
herself
do
little
and
emily
knew
ludovico
only
from
her
report
at
present
however
these
considerations
were
useless
madame
montoni
and
her
niece
being
shut
up
from
all
intercourse
even
with
the
persons
whom
there
might
be
these
reasons
to
reject
in
the
hall
confusion
and
tumult
still
reigned
emily
as
she
listened
anxiously
to
the
murmur
that
sounded
along
the
gallery
sometimes
fancied
she
heard
the
clashing
of
swords
and
when
she
considered
the
nature
of
the
provocation
given
by
montoni
and
his
impetuosity
it
appeared
probable
that
nothing
less
than
arms
would
terminate
the
contention
madame
montoni
having
exhausted
all
her
expressions
of
indignation
and
emily
hers
of
comfort
they
remained
silent
in
that
kind
of
breathless
stillness
which
in
nature
often
succeeds
to
the
uproar
of
conflicting
elements
a
stillness
like
the
morning
that
dawns
upon
the
ruins
of
an
earthquake
an
uncertain
kind
of
terror
pervaded
emilyâ€™s
mind
the
circumstances
of
the
past
hour
still
came
dimly
and
confusedly
to
her
memory
and
her
thoughts
were
various
and
rapid
though
without
tumult
from
this
state
of
waking
visions
she
was
recalled
by
a
knocking
at
the
chamber-door
and
enquiring
who
was
there
heard
the
whispering
voice
of
annette
â€œdear
madam
let
me
come
in
i
have
a
great
deal
to
sayâ€
said
the
poor
girl
â€œthe
door
is
lockedâ€
answered
the
lady
â€œyes
maâ€™am
but
do
pray
open
itâ€
â€œthe
signor
has
the
keyâ€
said
madame
montoni
â€œo
blessed
virgin
what
will
become
of
usâ€
exclaimed
annette
â€œassist
us
to
escapeâ€
said
her
mistress
â€œwhere
is
ludovicoâ€
â€œbelow
in
the
hall
maâ€™am
amongst
them
all
fighting
with
the
best
of
themâ€
â€œfighting
who
are
fightingâ€
cried
madame
montoni
â€œwhy
the
signor
maâ€™am
and
all
the
signors
and
a
great
many
moreâ€
â€œis
any
person
much
hurtâ€
said
emily
in
a
tremulous
voice
â€œhurt
yes
maâ€™amselleâ€”there
they
lie
bleeding
and
the
swords
are
clashing
andâ€”o
holy
saints
do
let
me
in
maâ€™am
they
are
coming
this
wayâ€”i
shall
be
murderedâ€
â€œflyâ€
cried
emily
â€œfly
we
cannot
open
the
doorâ€
annette
repeated
that
they
were
coming
and
in
the
same
moment
fled
â€œbe
calm
madamâ€
said
emily
turning
to
her
aunt
â€œi
entreat
you
to
be
calm
i
am
not
frightenedâ€”not
frightened
in
the
least
do
not
you
be
alarmedâ€
â€œyou
can
scarcely
support
yourselfâ€
replied
her
aunt
â€œmerciful
god
what
is
it
they
mean
to
do
with
usâ€
â€œthey
come
perhaps
to
liberate
usâ€
said
emily
â€œsignor
montoni
perhaps
isâ€”is
conqueredâ€
the
belief
of
his
death
gave
her
spirits
a
sudden
shock
and
she
grew
faint
as
she
saw
him
in
imagination
expiring
at
her
feet
â€œthey
are
comingâ€
cried
madame
montoniâ€”â€œi
hear
their
stepsâ€”they
are
at
the
doorâ€
emily
turned
her
languid
eyes
to
the
door
but
terror
deprived
her
of
utterance
the
key
sounded
in
the
lock
the
door
opened
and
montoni
appeared
followed
by
three
ruffian-like
men
â€œexecute
your
ordersâ€
said
he
turning
to
them
and
pointing
to
his
wife
who
shrieked
but
was
immediately
carried
from
the
room
while
emily
sunk
senseless
on
a
couch
by
which
she
had
endeavoured
to
support
herself
when
she
recovered
she
was
alone
and
recollected
only
that
madame
montoni
had
been
there
together
with
some
unconnected
particulars
of
the
preceding
transaction
which
were
however
sufficient
to
renew
all
her
terror
she
looked
wildly
round
the
apartment
as
if
in
search
of
some
means
of
intelligence
concerning
her
aunt
while
neither
her
own
danger
nor
an
idea
of
escaping
from
the
room
immediately
occurred
when
her
recollection
was
more
complete
she
raised
herself
and
went
but
with
only
a
faint
hope
to
examine
whether
the
door
was
unfastened
it
was
so
and
she
then
stepped
timidly
out
into
the
gallery
but
paused
there
uncertain
which
way
she
should
proceed
her
first
wish
was
to
gather
some
information
as
to
her
aunt
and
she
at
length
turned
her
steps
to
go
to
the
lesser
hall
where
annette
and
the
other
servants
usually
waited
everywhere
as
she
passed
she
heard
from
a
distance
the
uproar
of
contention
and
the
figures
and
faces
which
she
met
hurrying
along
the
passages
struck
her
mind
with
dismay
emily
might
now
have
appeared
like
an
angel
of
light
encompassed
by
fiends
at
length
she
reached
the
lesser
hall
which
was
silent
and
deserted
but
panting
for
breath
she
sat
down
to
recover
herself
the
total
stillness
of
this
place
was
as
awful
as
the
tumult
from
which
she
had
escaped
but
she
had
now
time
to
recall
her
scattered
thoughts
to
remember
her
personal
danger
and
to
consider
of
some
means
of
safety
she
perceived
that
it
was
useless
to
seek
madame
montoni
through
the
wide
extent
and
intricacies
of
the
castle
now
too
when
every
avenue
seemed
to
be
beset
by
ruffians
in
this
hall
she
could
not
resolve
to
stay
for
she
knew
not
how
soon
it
might
become
their
place
of
rendezvous
and
though
she
wished
to
go
to
her
chamber
she
dreaded
again
to
encounter
them
on
the
way
thus
she
sat
trembling
and
hesitating
when
a
distant
murmur
broke
on
the
silence
and
grew
louder
and
louder
till
she
distinguished
voices
and
steps
approaching
she
then
rose
to
go
but
the
sounds
came
along
the
only
passage
by
which
she
could
depart
and
she
was
compelled
to
await
in
the
hall
the
arrival
of
the
persons
whose
steps
she
heard
as
these
advanced
she
distinguished
groans
and
then
saw
a
man
borne
slowly
along
by
four
others
her
spirits
faltered
at
the
sight
and
she
leaned
against
the
wall
for
support
the
bearers
meanwhile
entered
the
hall
and
being
too
busily
occupied
to
detain
or
even
notice
emily
she
attempted
to
leave
it
but
her
strength
failed
and
she
again
sat
down
on
the
bench
a
damp
chillness
came
over
her
her
sight
became
confused
she
knew
not
what
had
passed
or
where
she
was
yet
the
groans
of
the
wounded
person
still
vibrated
on
her
heart
in
a
few
moments
the
tide
of
life
seemed
again
to
flow
she
began
to
breathe
more
freely
and
her
senses
revived
she
had
not
fainted
nor
had
ever
totally
lost
her
consciousness
but
had
contrived
to
support
herself
on
the
bench
still
without
courage
to
turn
her
eyes
upon
the
unfortunate
object
which
remained
near
her
and
about
whom
the
men
were
yet
too
much
engaged
to
attend
to
her
when
her
strength
returned
she
rose
and
was
suffered
to
leave
the
hall
though
her
anxiety
having
produced
some
vain
enquiries
concerning
madame
montoni
had
thus
made
a
discovery
of
herself
towards
her
chamber
she
now
hastened
as
fast
as
her
steps
would
bear
her
for
she
still
perceived
upon
her
passage
the
sounds
of
confusion
at
a
distance
and
she
endeavoured
by
taking
her
way
through
some
obscure
rooms
to
avoid
encountering
the
persons
whose
looks
had
terrified
her
before
as
well
as
those
parts
of
the
castle
where
the
tumult
might
still
rage
at
length
she
reached
her
chamber
and
having
secured
the
door
of
the
corridor
felt
herself
for
a
moment
in
safety
a
profound
stillness
reigned
in
this
remote
apartment
which
not
even
the
faint
murmur
of
the
most
distant
sounds
now
reached
she
sat
down
near
one
of
the
casements
and
as
she
gazed
on
the
mountain-view
beyond
the
deep
repose
of
its
beauty
struck
her
with
all
the
force
of
contrast
and
she
could
scarcely
believe
herself
so
near
a
scene
of
savage
discord
the
contending
elements
seemed
to
have
retired
from
their
natural
spheres
and
to
have
collected
themselves
into
the
minds
of
men
for
there
alone
the
tempest
now
reigned
emily
tried
to
tranquillize
her
spirits
but
anxiety
made
her
constantly
listen
for
some
sound
and
often
look
out
upon
the
ramparts
where
all
however
was
lonely
and
still
as
a
sense
of
her
own
immediate
danger
had
decreased
her
apprehension
concerning
madame
montoni
heightened
who
she
remembered
had
been
fiercely
threatened
with
confinement
in
the
east
turret
and
it
was
possible
that
her
husband
had
satisfied
his
present
vengeance
with
this
punishment
she
therefore
determined
when
night
should
return
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
castle
should
be
asleep
to
explore
the
way
to
the
turret
which
as
the
direction
it
stood
in
was
mentioned
appeared
not
very
difficult
to
be
done
she
knew
indeed
that
although
her
aunt
might
be
there
she
could
afford
her
no
effectual
assistance
but
it
might
give
her
some
comfort
even
to
know
that
she
was
discovered
and
to
hear
the
sound
of
her
nieceâ€™s
voice
for
herself
any
certainty
concerning
madame
montoniâ€™s
fate
appeared
more
tolerable
than
this
exhausting
suspense
meanwhile
annette
did
not
appear
and
emily
was
surprised
and
somewhat
alarmed
for
her
whom
in
the
confusion
of
the
late
scene
various
accidents
might
have
befallen
and
it
was
improbable
that
she
would
have
failed
to
come
to
her
apartment
unless
something
unfortunate
had
happened
thus
the
hours
passed
in
solitude
in
silence
and
in
anxious
conjecturing
being
not
once
disturbed
by
a
message
or
a
sound
it
appeared
that
montoni
had
wholly
forgotten
her
and
it
gave
her
some
comfort
to
find
that
she
could
be
so
unnoticed
she
endeavoured
to
withdraw
her
thoughts
from
the
anxiety
that
preyed
upon
them
but
they
refused
control
she
could
neither
read
nor
draw
and
the
tones
of
her
lute
were
so
utterly
discordant
with
the
present
state
of
her
feelings
that
she
could
not
endure
them
for
a
moment
the
sun
at
length
set
behind
the
western
mountains
his
fiery
beams
faded
from
the
clouds
and
then
a
dun
melancholy
purple
drew
over
them
and
gradually
involved
the
features
of
the
country
below
soon
after
the
sentinels
passed
on
the
rampart
to
commence
the
watch
twilight
had
now
spread
its
gloom
over
every
object
the
dismal
obscurity
of
her
chamber
recalled
fearful
thoughts
but
she
remembered
that
to
procure
a
light
she
must
pass
through
a
great
extent
of
the
castle
and
above
all
through
the
halls
where
she
had
already
experienced
so
much
horror
darkness
indeed
in
the
present
state
of
her
spirits
made
silence
and
solitude
terrible
to
her
it
would
also
prevent
the
possibility
of
her
finding
her
way
to
the
turret
and
condemn
her
to
remain
in
suspense
concerning
the
fate
of
her
aunt
yet
she
dared
not
to
venture
forth
for
a
lamp
continuing
at
the
casement
that
she
might
catch
the
last
lingering
gleam
of
evening
a
thousand
vague
images
of
fear
floated
on
her
fancy
â€œwhat
if
some
of
these
ruffiansâ€
said
she
â€œshould
find
out
the
private
staircase
and
in
the
darkness
of
night
steal
into
my
chamberâ€
then
recollecting
the
mysterious
inhabitant
of
the
neighbouring
apartment
her
terror
changed
its
object
â€œhe
is
not
a
prisonerâ€
said
she
â€œthough
he
remains
in
one
chamber
for
montoni
did
not
fasten
the
door
when
he
left
it
the
unknown
person
himself
did
this
it
is
certain
therefore
he
can
come
out
when
he
pleasesâ€
she
paused
for
notwithstanding
the
terrors
of
darkness
she
considered
it
to
be
very
improbable
whoever
he
was
that
he
could
have
any
interest
in
intruding
upon
her
retirement
and
again
the
subject
of
her
emotion
changed
when
remembering
her
nearness
to
the
chamber
where
the
veil
had
formerly
disclosed
a
dreadful
spectacle
she
doubted
whether
some
passage
might
not
communicate
between
it
and
the
insecure
door
of
the
staircase
it
was
now
entirely
dark
and
she
left
the
casement
as
she
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
hearth
she
thought
she
perceived
there
a
spark
of
light
it
twinkled
and
disappeared
and
then
again
was
visible
at
length
with
much
care
she
fanned
the
embers
of
a
wood
fire
that
had
been
lighted
in
the
morning
into
flame
and
having
communicated
it
to
a
lamp
which
always
stood
in
her
room
felt
a
satisfaction
not
to
be
conceived
without
a
review
of
her
situation
her
first
care
was
to
guard
the
door
of
the
staircase
for
which
purpose
she
placed
against
it
all
the
furniture
she
could
move
and
she
was
thus
employed
for
some
time
at
the
end
of
which
she
had
another
instance
how
much
more
oppressive
misfortune
is
to
the
idle
than
to
the
busy
for
having
then
leisure
to
think
over
all
the
circumstances
of
her
present
afflictions
she
imagined
a
thousand
evils
for
futurity
and
these
real
and
ideal
subjects
of
distress
alike
wounded
her
mind
thus
heavily
moved
the
hours
till
midnight
when
she
counted
the
sullen
notes
of
the
great
clock
as
they
rolled
along
the
rampart
unmingled
with
any
sound
except
the
distant
foot-fall
of
a
sentinel
who
came
to
relieve
guard
she
now
thought
she
might
venture
towards
the
turret
and
having
gently
opened
the
chamber
door
to
examine
the
corridor
and
to
listen
if
any
person
was
stirring
in
the
castle
found
all
around
in
perfect
stillness
yet
no
sooner
had
she
left
the
room
than
she
perceived
a
light
flash
on
the
walls
of
the
corridor
and
without
waiting
to
see
by
whom
it
was
carried
she
shrunk
back
and
closed
her
door
no
one
approaching
she
conjectured
that
it
was
montoni
going
to
pay
his
midnight
visit
to
her
unknown
neighbour
and
she
determined
to
wait
till
he
should
have
retired
to
his
own
apartment
when
the
chimes
had
tolled
another
half
hour
she
once
more
opened
the
door
and
perceiving
that
no
person
was
in
the
corridor
hastily
crossed
into
a
passage
that
led
along
the
south
side
of
the
castle
towards
the
staircase
whence
she
believed
she
could
easily
find
her
way
to
the
turret
often
pausing
on
her
way
listening
apprehensively
to
the
murmurs
of
the
wind
and
looking
fearfully
onward
into
the
gloom
of
the
long
passages
she
at
length
reached
the
staircase
but
there
her
perplexity
began
two
passages
appeared
of
which
she
knew
not
how
to
prefer
one
and
was
compelled
at
last
to
decide
by
chance
rather
than
by
circumstances
that
she
entered
opened
first
into
a
wide
gallery
along
which
she
passed
lightly
and
swiftly
for
the
lonely
aspect
of
the
place
awed
her
and
she
started
at
the
echo
of
her
own
steps
on
a
sudden
she
thought
she
heard
a
voice
and
not
distinguishing
from
whence
it
came
feared
equally
to
proceed
or
to
return
for
some
moments
she
stood
in
an
attitude
of
listening
expectation
shrinking
almost
from
herself
and
scarcely
daring
to
look
round
her
the
voice
came
again
but
though
it
was
now
near
her
terror
did
not
allow
her
to
judge
exactly
whence
it
proceeded
she
thought
however
that
it
was
the
voice
of
complaint
and
her
belief
was
soon
confirmed
by
a
low
moaning
sound
that
seemed
to
proceed
from
one
of
the
chambers
opening
into
the
gallery
it
instantly
occurred
to
her
that
madame
montoni
might
be
there
confined
and
she
advanced
to
the
door
to
speak
but
was
checked
by
considering
that
she
was
perhaps
going
to
commit
herself
to
a
stranger
who
might
discover
her
to
montoni
for
though
this
person
whoever
it
was
seemed
to
be
in
affliction
it
did
not
follow
that
he
was
a
prisoner
while
these
thoughts
passed
over
her
mind
and
left
her
still
in
hesitation
the
voice
spoke
again
and
calling
â€œludovicoâ€
she
then
perceived
it
to
be
that
of
annette
on
which
no
longer
hesitating
she
went
in
joy
to
answer
her
â€œludovicoâ€
cried
annette
sobbingâ€”â€œludovicoâ€
â€œit
is
not
ludovico
it
is
iâ€”mademoiselle
emilyâ€
annette
ceased
sobbing
and
was
silent
â€œif
you
can
open
the
door
let
me
inâ€
said
emily
â€œhere
is
no
person
to
hurt
youâ€
â€œludovicoâ€”o
ludovicoâ€
cried
annette
emily
now
lost
her
patience
and
her
fear
of
being
overheard
increasing
she
was
even
nearly
about
to
leave
the
door
when
she
considered
that
annette
might
possibly
know
something
of
the
situation
of
madame
montoni
or
direct
her
to
the
turret
at
length
she
obtained
a
reply
though
little
satisfactory
to
her
questions
for
annette
knew
nothing
of
madame
montoni
and
only
conjured
emily
to
tell
her
what
was
become
of
ludovico
of
him
she
had
no
information
to
give
and
she
again
asked
who
had
shut
annette
up
â€œludovicoâ€
said
the
poor
girl
â€œludovico
shut
me
up
when
i
ran
away
from
the
dressing-room
door
today
i
went
i
scarcely
knew
where
for
safety
and
in
this
gallery
here
i
met
ludovico
who
hurried
me
into
this
chamber
and
locked
me
up
to
keep
me
out
of
harm
as
he
said
but
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
himself
he
hardly
spoke
ten
words
but
he
told
me
he
would
come
and
let
me
out
when
all
was
quiet
and
he
took
away
the
key
with
him
now
all
these
hours
are
passed
and
i
have
neither
seen
nor
heard
a
word
of
him
they
have
murdered
himâ€”i
know
they
haveâ€
emily
suddenly
remembered
the
wounded
person
whom
she
had
seen
borne
into
the
servantsâ€™
hall
and
she
scarcely
doubted
that
he
was
ludovico
but
she
concealed
the
circumstance
from
annette
and
endeavoured
to
comfort
her
then
impatient
to
learn
something
of
her
aunt
she
again
enquired
the
way
to
the
turret
â€œo
you
are
not
going
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œfor
heavenâ€™s
sake
do
not
go
and
leave
me
here
by
myselfâ€
â€œnay
annette
you
do
not
think
i
can
wait
in
the
gallery
all
nightâ€
replied
emily
â€œdirect
me
to
the
turret
in
the
morning
i
will
endeavour
to
release
youâ€
â€œo
holy
maryâ€
exclaimed
annette
â€œam
i
to
stay
here
by
myself
all
night
i
shall
be
frightened
out
of
my
senses
and
i
shall
die
of
hunger
i
have
had
nothing
to
eat
since
dinnerâ€
emily
could
scarcely
forbear
smiling
at
the
heterogeneous
distresses
of
annette
though
she
sincerely
pitied
them
and
said
what
she
could
to
sooth
her
at
length
she
obtained
something
like
a
direction
to
the
east
turret
and
quitted
the
door
from
whence
after
many
intricacies
and
perplexities
she
reached
the
steep
and
winding
stairs
of
the
turret
at
the
foot
of
which
she
stopped
to
rest
and
to
reanimate
her
courage
with
a
sense
of
her
duty
as
she
surveyed
this
dismal
place
she
perceived
a
door
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
staircase
and
anxious
to
know
whether
it
would
lead
her
to
madame
montoni
she
tried
to
undraw
the
bolts
which
fastened
it
a
fresher
air
came
to
her
face
as
she
unclosed
the
door
which
opened
upon
the
east
rampart
and
the
sudden
current
had
nearly
extinguished
her
light
which
she
now
removed
to
a
distance
and
again
looking
out
upon
the
obscure
terrace
she
perceived
only
the
faint
outline
of
the
walls
and
of
some
towers
while
above
heavy
clouds
borne
along
the
wind
seemed
to
mingle
with
the
stars
and
wrap
the
night
in
thicker
darkness
as
she
gazed
now
willing
to
defer
the
moment
of
certainty
from
which
she
expected
only
confirmation
of
evil
a
distant
footstep
reminded
her
that
she
might
be
observed
by
the
men
on
watch
and
hastily
closing
the
door
she
took
her
lamp
and
passed
up
the
staircase
trembling
came
upon
her
as
she
ascended
through
the
gloom
to
her
melancholy
fancy
this
seemed
to
be
a
place
of
death
and
the
chilling
silence
that
reigned
confirmed
its
character
her
spirits
faltered
â€œperhapsâ€
said
she
â€œi
am
come
hither
only
to
learn
a
dreadful
truth
or
to
witness
some
horrible
spectacle
i
feel
that
my
senses
would
not
survive
such
an
addition
of
horrorâ€
the
image
of
her
aunt
murderedâ€”murdered
perhaps
by
the
hand
of
montoni
rose
to
her
mind
she
trembled
gasped
for
breathâ€”repented
that
she
had
dared
to
venture
hither
and
checked
her
steps
but
after
she
had
paused
a
few
minutes
the
consciousness
of
her
duty
returned
and
she
went
on
still
all
was
silent
at
length
a
track
of
blood
upon
a
stair
caught
her
eye
and
instantly
she
perceived
that
the
wall
and
several
other
steps
were
stained
she
paused
again
struggled
to
support
herself
and
the
lamp
almost
fell
from
her
trembling
hand
still
no
sound
was
heard
no
living
being
seemed
to
inhabit
the
turret
a
thousand
times
she
wished
herself
again
in
her
chamber
dreaded
to
enquire
fartherâ€”dreaded
to
encounter
some
horrible
spectacle
and
yet
could
not
resolve
now
that
she
was
so
near
the
termination
of
her
efforts
to
desist
from
them
having
again
collected
courage
to
proceed
after
ascending
about
half
way
up
the
turret
she
came
to
another
door
but
here
again
she
stopped
in
hesitation
listened
for
sounds
within
and
then
summoning
all
her
resolution
unclosed
it
and
entered
a
chamber
which
as
her
lamp
shot
its
feeble
rays
through
the
darkness
seemed
to
exhibit
only
dew-stained
and
deserted
walls
as
she
stood
examining
it
in
fearful
expectation
of
discovering
the
remains
of
her
unfortunate
aunt
she
perceived
something
lying
in
an
obscure
corner
of
the
room
and
struck
with
a
horrible
conviction
she
became
for
an
instant
motionless
and
nearly
insensible
then
with
a
kind
of
desperate
resolution
she
hurried
towards
the
object
that
excited
her
terror
when
perceiving
the
clothes
of
some
person
on
the
floor
she
caught
hold
of
them
and
found
in
her
grasp
the
old
uniform
of
a
soldier
beneath
which
appeared
a
heap
of
pikes
and
other
arms
scarcely
daring
to
trust
her
sight
she
continued
for
some
moments
to
gaze
on
the
object
of
her
late
alarm
and
then
left
the
chamber
so
much
comforted
and
occupied
by
the
conviction
that
her
aunt
was
not
there
that
she
was
going
to
descend
the
turret
without
enquiring
farther
when
on
turning
to
do
so
she
observed
upon
some
steps
on
the
second
flight
an
appearance
of
blood
and
remembering
that
there
was
yet
another
chamber
to
be
explored
she
again
followed
the
windings
of
the
ascent
still
as
she
ascended
the
track
of
blood
glared
upon
the
stairs
it
led
her
to
the
door
of
a
landing-place
that
terminated
them
but
she
was
unable
to
follow
it
farther
now
that
she
was
so
near
the
sought-for
certainty
she
dreaded
to
know
it
even
more
than
before
and
had
not
fortitude
sufficient
to
speak
or
to
attempt
opening
the
door
having
listened
in
vain
for
some
sound
that
might
confirm
or
destroy
her
fears
she
at
length
laid
her
hand
on
the
lock
and
finding
it
fastened
called
on
madame
montoni
but
only
a
chilling
silence
ensued
â€œshe
is
deadâ€
she
criedâ€”â€œmurderedâ€”her
blood
is
on
the
stairsâ€
emily
grew
very
faint
could
support
herself
no
longer
and
had
scarcely
presence
of
mind
to
set
down
the
lamp
and
place
herself
on
a
step
when
her
recollection
returned
she
spoke
again
at
the
door
and
again
attempted
to
open
it
and
having
lingered
for
some
time
without
receiving
any
answer
or
hearing
a
sound
she
descended
the
turret
and
with
all
the
swiftness
her
feebleness
would
permit
sought
her
own
apartment
as
she
turned
into
the
corridor
the
door
of
a
chamber
opened
from
whence
montoni
came
forth
but
emily
more
terrified
than
ever
to
behold
him
shrunk
back
into
the
passage
soon
enough
to
escape
being
noticed
and
heard
him
close
the
door
which
she
had
perceived
was
the
same
she
formerly
observed
having
here
listened
to
his
departing
steps
till
their
faint
sound
was
lost
in
distance
she
ventured
to
her
apartment
and
securing
it
once
again
retired
to
her
bed
leaving
the
lamp
burning
on
the
hearth
but
sleep
was
fled
from
her
harassed
mind
to
which
images
of
horror
alone
occurred
she
endeavoured
to
think
it
possible
that
madame
montoni
had
not
been
taken
to
the
turret
but
when
she
recollected
the
former
menaces
of
her
husband
and
the
terrible
spirit
of
vengeance
which
he
had
displayed
on
a
late
occasion
when
she
remembered
his
general
character
the
looks
of
the
men
who
had
forced
madame
montoni
from
her
apartment
and
the
written
traces
on
the
stairs
of
the
turretâ€”she
could
not
doubt
that
her
aunt
had
been
carried
thither
and
could
scarcely
hope
that
she
had
not
been
carried
to
be
murdered
the
grey
of
morning
had
long
dawned
through
her
casements
before
emily
closed
her
eyes
in
sleep
when
wearied
nature
at
length
yielded
her
a
respite
from
suffering
who
rears
the
bloody
hand
sayers
emily
remained
in
her
chamber
on
the
following
morning
without
receiving
any
notice
from
montoni
or
seeing
a
human
being
except
the
armed
men
who
sometimes
passed
on
the
terrace
below
having
tasted
no
food
since
the
dinner
of
the
preceding
day
extreme
faintness
made
her
feel
the
necessity
of
quitting
the
asylum
of
her
apartment
to
obtain
refreshment
and
she
was
also
very
anxious
to
procure
liberty
for
annette
willing
however
to
defer
venturing
forth
as
long
as
possible
and
considering
whether
she
should
apply
to
montoni
or
to
the
compassion
of
some
other
person
her
excessive
anxiety
concerning
her
aunt
at
length
overcame
her
abhorrence
of
his
presence
and
she
determined
to
go
to
him
and
to
entreat
that
he
would
suffer
her
to
see
madame
montoni
meanwhile
it
was
too
certain
from
the
absence
of
annette
that
some
accident
had
befallen
ludovico
and
that
she
was
still
in
confinement
emily
therefore
resolved
also
to
visit
the
chamber
where
she
had
spoken
to
her
on
the
preceding
night
and
if
the
poor
girl
was
yet
there
to
inform
montoni
of
her
situation
it
was
near
noon
before
she
ventured
from
her
apartment
and
went
first
to
the
south
gallery
whither
she
passed
without
meeting
a
single
person
or
hearing
a
sound
except
now
and
then
the
echo
of
a
distant
footstep
it
was
unnecessary
to
call
annette
whose
lamentations
were
audible
upon
the
first
approach
to
the
gallery
and
who
bewailing
her
own
and
ludovicoâ€™s
fate
told
emily
that
she
should
certainly
be
starved
to
death
if
she
was
not
let
out
immediately
emily
replied
that
she
was
going
to
beg
her
release
of
montoni
but
the
terrors
of
hunger
now
yielded
to
those
of
the
signor
and
when
emily
left
her
she
was
loudly
entreating
that
her
place
of
refuge
might
be
concealed
from
him
as
emily
drew
near
the
great
hall
the
sounds
she
heard
and
the
people
she
met
in
the
passages
renewed
her
alarm
the
latter
however
were
peaceable
and
did
not
interrupt
her
though
they
looked
earnestly
at
her
as
she
passed
and
sometimes
spoke
on
crossing
the
hall
towards
the
cedar
room
where
montoni
usually
sat
she
perceived
on
the
pavement
fragments
of
swords
some
tattered
garments
stained
with
blood
and
almost
expected
to
have
seen
among
them
a
dead
body
but
from
such
a
spectacle
she
was
at
present
spared
as
she
approached
the
room
the
sound
of
several
voices
issued
from
within
and
a
dread
of
appearing
before
many
strangers
as
well
as
of
irritating
montoni
by
such
an
intrusion
made
her
pause
and
falter
from
her
purpose
she
looked
up
through
the
long
arcades
of
the
hall
in
search
of
a
servant
who
might
bear
a
message
but
no
one
appeared
and
the
urgency
of
what
she
had
to
request
made
her
still
linger
near
the
door
the
voices
within
were
not
in
contention
though
she
distinguished
those
of
several
of
the
guests
of
the
preceding
day
but
still
her
resolution
failed
whenever
she
would
have
tapped
at
the
door
and
she
had
determined
to
walk
in
the
hall
till
some
person
should
appear
who
might
call
montoni
from
the
room
when
as
she
turned
from
the
door
it
was
suddenly
opened
by
himself
emily
trembled
and
was
confused
while
he
almost
started
with
surprise
and
all
the
terrors
of
his
countenance
unfolded
themselves
she
forgot
all
she
would
have
said
and
neither
enquired
for
her
aunt
nor
entreated
for
annette
but
stood
silent
and
embarrassed
after
closing
the
door
he
reproved
her
for
a
meanness
of
which
she
had
not
been
guilty
and
sternly
questioned
her
what
she
had
overheard
an
accusation
which
revived
her
recollection
so
far
that
she
assured
him
she
had
not
come
thither
with
an
intention
to
listen
to
his
conversation
but
to
entreat
his
compassion
for
her
aunt
and
for
annette
montoni
seemed
to
doubt
this
assertion
for
he
regarded
her
with
a
scrutinizing
look
and
the
doubt
evidently
arose
from
no
trifling
interest
emily
then
further
explained
herself
and
concluded
with
entreating
him
to
inform
her
where
her
aunt
was
placed
and
to
permit
that
she
might
visit
her
but
he
looked
upon
her
only
with
a
malignant
smile
which
instantaneously
confirmed
her
worst
fears
for
her
aunt
and
at
that
moment
she
had
not
courage
to
renew
her
entreaties
â€œfor
annetteâ€
said
heâ€”â€œif
you
go
to
carlo
he
will
release
the
girl
the
foolish
fellow
who
shut
her
up
died
yesterdayâ€
emily
shudderedâ€”â€œbut
my
aunt
signorâ€â€”said
she
â€œo
tell
me
of
my
auntâ€
â€œshe
is
taken
care
ofâ€
replied
montoni
hastily
â€œi
have
no
time
to
answer
idle
questionsâ€
he
would
have
passed
on
but
emily
in
a
voice
of
agony
that
could
not
be
wholly
resisted
conjured
him
to
tell
her
where
madame
montoni
was
while
he
paused
and
she
anxiously
watched
his
countenance
a
trumpet
sounded
and
in
the
next
moment
she
heard
the
heavy
gates
of
the
portal
open
and
then
the
clattering
of
horsesâ€™
hoofs
in
the
court
with
the
confusion
of
many
voices
she
stood
for
a
moment
hesitating
whether
she
should
follow
montoni
who
at
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
had
passed
through
the
hall
and
turning
her
eyes
whence
it
came
she
saw
through
the
door
that
opened
beyond
a
long
perspective
of
arches
into
the
courts
a
party
of
horsemen
whom
she
judged
as
well
as
the
distance
and
her
embarrassment
would
allow
to
be
the
same
she
had
seen
depart
a
few
days
before
but
she
staid
not
to
scrutinize
for
when
the
trumpet
sounded
again
the
chevaliers
rushed
out
of
the
cedar
room
and
men
came
running
into
the
hall
from
every
quarter
of
the
castle
emily
once
more
hurried
for
shelter
to
her
own
apartment
thither
she
was
still
pursued
by
images
of
horror
she
reconsidered
montoniâ€™s
manner
and
words
when
he
had
spoken
of
his
wife
and
they
served
only
to
confirm
her
most
terrible
suspicions
tears
refused
any
longer
to
relieve
her
distress
and
she
had
sat
for
a
considerable
time
absorbed
in
thought
when
a
knocking
at
the
chamber
door
aroused
her
on
opening
which
she
found
old
carlo
â€œdear
young
ladyâ€
said
he
â€œi
have
been
so
flurried
i
never
once
thought
of
you
till
just
now
i
have
brought
you
some
fruit
and
wine
and
i
am
sure
you
must
stand
in
need
of
them
by
this
timeâ€
â€œthank
you
carloâ€
said
emily
â€œthis
is
very
good
of
you
did
the
signor
remind
you
of
meâ€
â€œno
signoraâ€
replied
carlo
â€œhis
excellenza
has
business
enough
on
his
handsâ€
emily
then
renewed
her
enquiries
concerning
madame
montoni
but
carlo
had
been
employed
at
the
other
end
of
the
castle
during
the
time
that
she
was
removed
and
he
had
heard
nothing
since
concerning
her
while
he
spoke
emily
looked
steadily
at
him
for
she
scarcely
knew
whether
he
was
really
ignorant
or
concealed
his
knowledge
of
the
truth
from
a
fear
of
offending
his
master
to
several
questions
concerning
the
contentions
of
yesterday
he
gave
very
limited
answers
but
told
that
the
disputes
were
now
amicably
settled
and
that
the
signor
believed
himself
to
have
been
mistaken
in
his
suspicions
of
his
guests
â€œthe
fighting
was
about
that
signoraâ€
said
carlo
â€œbut
i
trust
i
shall
never
see
such
another
day
in
this
castle
though
strange
things
are
about
to
be
doneâ€
on
her
enquiring
his
meaning
â€œah
signoraâ€
added
he
â€œit
is
not
for
me
to
betray
secrets
or
tell
all
i
think
but
time
will
tellâ€
she
then
desired
him
to
release
annette
and
having
described
the
chamber
in
which
the
poor
girl
was
confined
he
promised
to
obey
her
immediately
and
was
departing
when
she
remembered
to
ask
who
were
the
persons
just
arrived
her
late
conjecture
was
right
it
was
verezzi
with
his
party
her
spirits
were
somewhat
soothed
by
this
short
conversation
with
carlo
for
in
her
present
circumstances
it
afforded
some
comfort
to
hear
the
accents
of
compassion
and
to
meet
the
look
of
sympathy
an
hour
passed
before
annette
appeared
who
then
came
weeping
and
sobbing
â€œo
ludovicoâ€”ludovicoâ€
cried
she
â€œmy
poor
annetteâ€
said
emily
and
made
her
sit
down
â€œwho
could
have
foreseen
this
maâ€™amselle
o
miserable
wretched
dayâ€”that
ever
i
should
live
to
see
itâ€
and
she
continued
to
moan
and
lament
till
emily
thought
it
necessary
to
check
her
excess
of
grief
â€œwe
are
continually
losing
dear
friends
by
deathâ€
said
she
with
a
sigh
that
came
from
her
heart
â€œwe
must
submit
to
the
will
of
heavenâ€”our
tears
alas
cannot
recall
the
deadâ€
annette
took
the
handkerchief
from
her
face
â€œyou
will
meet
ludovico
in
a
better
world
i
hopeâ€
added
emily
â€œyesâ€”yesâ€”maâ€™amselleâ€
sobbed
annette
â€œbut
i
hope
i
shall
meet
him
again
in
thisâ€”though
he
is
so
woundedâ€
â€œwoundedâ€
exclaimed
emily
â€œdoes
he
liveâ€
â€œyes
maâ€™am
butâ€”but
he
has
a
terrible
wound
and
could
not
come
to
let
me
out
they
thought
him
dead
at
first
and
he
has
not
been
rightly
himself
till
within
this
hourâ€
â€œwell
annette
i
rejoice
to
hear
he
livesâ€
â€œlives
holy
saints
why
he
will
not
die
surelyâ€
emily
said
she
hoped
not
but
this
expression
of
hope
annette
thought
implied
fear
and
her
own
increased
in
proportion
as
emily
endeavoured
to
encourage
her
to
enquiries
concerning
madame
montoni
she
could
give
no
satisfactory
answers
â€œi
quite
forgot
to
ask
among
the
servants
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
she
â€œfor
i
could
think
of
nobody
but
poor
ludovicoâ€
annetteâ€™s
grief
was
now
somewhat
assuaged
and
emily
sent
her
to
make
enquiries
concerning
her
lady
of
whom
however
she
could
obtain
no
intelligence
some
of
the
people
she
spoke
with
being
really
ignorant
of
her
fate
and
others
having
probably
received
orders
to
conceal
it
this
day
passed
with
emily
in
continued
grief
and
anxiety
for
her
aunt
but
she
was
unmolested
by
any
notice
from
montoni
and
now
that
annette
was
liberated
she
obtained
food
without
exposing
herself
to
danger
or
impertinence
two
following
days
passed
in
the
same
manner
unmarked
by
any
occurrence
during
which
she
obtained
no
information
of
madame
montoni
on
the
evening
of
the
second
having
dismissed
annette
and
retired
to
bed
her
mind
became
haunted
by
the
most
dismal
images
such
as
her
long
anxiety
concerning
her
aunt
suggested
and
unable
to
forget
herself
for
a
moment
or
to
vanquish
the
phantoms
that
tormented
her
she
rose
from
her
bed
and
went
to
one
of
the
casements
of
her
chamber
to
breathe
a
freer
air
all
without
was
silent
and
dark
unless
that
could
be
called
light
which
was
only
the
faint
glimmer
of
the
stars
showing
imperfectly
the
outline
of
the
mountains
the
western
towers
of
the
castle
and
the
ramparts
below
where
a
solitary
sentinel
was
pacing
what
an
image
of
repose
did
this
scene
present
the
fierce
and
terrible
passions
too
which
so
often
agitated
the
inhabitants
of
this
edifice
seemed
now
hushed
in
sleepâ€”those
mysterious
workings
that
rouse
the
elements
of
manâ€™s
nature
into
tempestâ€”were
calm
emilyâ€™s
heart
was
not
so
but
her
sufferings
though
deep
partook
of
the
gentle
character
of
her
mind
hers
was
a
silent
anguish
weeping
yet
enduring
not
the
wild
energy
of
passion
inflaming
imagination
bearing
down
the
barriers
of
reason
and
living
in
a
world
of
its
own
the
air
refreshed
her
and
she
continued
at
the
casement
looking
on
the
shadowy
scene
over
which
the
planets
burned
with
a
clear
light
amid
the
deep
blue
ã¦ther
as
they
silently
moved
in
their
destined
course
she
remembered
how
often
she
had
gazed
on
them
with
her
dear
father
how
often
he
had
pointed
out
their
way
in
the
heavens
and
explained
their
laws
and
these
reflections
led
to
others
which
in
an
almost
equal
degree
awakened
her
grief
and
astonishment
they
brought
a
retrospect
of
all
the
strange
and
mournful
events
which
had
occurred
since
she
lived
in
peace
with
her
parents
and
to
emily
who
had
been
so
tenderly
educated
so
tenderly
loved
who
once
knew
only
goodness
and
happinessâ€”to
her
the
late
events
and
her
present
situationâ€”in
a
foreign
landâ€”in
a
remote
castleâ€”surrounded
by
vice
and
violenceâ€”seemed
more
like
the
visions
of
a
distempered
imagination
than
the
circumstances
of
truth
she
wept
to
think
of
what
her
parents
would
have
suffered
could
they
have
foreseen
the
events
of
her
future
life
while
she
raised
her
streaming
eyes
to
heaven
she
observed
the
same
planet
which
she
had
seen
in
languedoc
on
the
night
preceding
her
fatherâ€™s
death
rise
above
the
eastern
towers
of
the
castle
while
she
remembered
the
conversation
which
has
passed
concerning
the
probable
state
of
departed
souls
remembered
also
the
solemn
music
she
had
heard
and
to
which
the
tenderness
of
her
spirits
had
in
spite
of
her
reason
given
a
superstitious
meaning
at
these
recollections
she
wept
again
and
continued
musing
when
suddenly
the
notes
of
sweet
music
passed
on
the
air
a
superstitious
dread
stole
over
her
she
stood
listening
for
some
moments
in
trembling
expectation
and
then
endeavoured
to
recollect
her
thoughts
and
to
reason
herself
into
composure
but
human
reason
cannot
establish
her
laws
on
subjects
lost
in
the
obscurity
of
imagination
any
more
than
the
eye
can
ascertain
the
form
of
objects
that
only
glimmer
through
the
dimness
of
night
her
surprise
on
hearing
such
soothing
and
delicious
sounds
was
at
least
justifiable
for
it
was
longâ€”very
long
since
she
had
listened
to
anything
like
melody
the
fierce
trumpet
and
the
shrill
fife
were
the
only
instruments
she
had
heard
since
her
arrival
at
udolpho
when
her
mind
was
somewhat
more
composed
she
tried
to
ascertain
from
what
quarter
the
sounds
proceeded
and
thought
they
came
from
below
but
whether
from
a
room
of
the
castle
or
from
the
terrace
she
could
not
with
certainty
judge
fear
and
surprise
now
yielded
to
the
enchantment
of
a
strain
that
floated
on
the
silent
night
with
the
most
soft
and
melancholy
sweetness
suddenly
it
seemed
removed
to
a
distance
trembled
faintly
and
then
entirely
ceased
she
continued
to
listen
sunk
in
that
pleasing
repose
which
soft
music
leaves
on
the
mindâ€”but
it
came
no
more
upon
this
strange
circumstance
her
thoughts
were
long
engaged
for
strange
it
certainly
was
to
hear
music
at
midnight
when
every
inhabitant
of
the
castle
had
long
since
retired
to
rest
and
in
a
place
where
nothing
like
harmony
had
been
heard
before
probably
for
many
years
long
suffering
had
made
her
spirits
peculiarly
sensible
to
terror
and
liable
to
be
affected
by
the
illusions
of
superstitionâ€”it
now
seemed
to
her
as
if
her
dead
father
had
spoken
to
her
in
that
strain
to
inspire
her
with
comfort
and
confidence
on
the
subject
which
had
then
occupied
her
mind
yet
reason
told
her
that
this
was
a
wild
conjecture
and
she
was
inclined
to
dismiss
it
but
with
the
inconsistency
so
natural
when
imagination
guides
the
thoughts
she
then
wavered
towards
a
belief
as
wild
she
remembered
the
singular
event
connected
with
the
castle
which
had
given
it
into
the
possession
of
its
present
owner
and
when
she
considered
the
mysterious
manner
in
which
its
late
possessor
had
disappeared
and
that
she
had
never
since
been
heard
of
her
mind
was
impressed
with
a
high
degree
of
solemn
awe
so
that
though
there
appeared
no
clue
to
connect
that
event
with
the
late
music
she
was
inclined
fancifully
to
think
they
had
some
relation
to
each
other
at
this
conjecture
a
sudden
chillness
ran
through
her
frame
she
looked
fearfully
upon
the
duskiness
of
her
chamber
and
the
dead
silence
that
prevailed
there
heightened
to
her
fancy
its
gloomy
aspect
at
length
she
left
the
casement
but
her
steps
faltered
as
she
approached
the
bed
and
she
stopped
and
looked
round
the
single
lamp
that
burned
in
her
spacious
chamber
was
expiring
for
a
moment
she
shrunk
from
the
darkness
beyond
and
then
ashamed
of
the
weakness
which
however
she
could
not
wholly
conquer
went
forward
to
the
bed
where
her
mind
did
not
soon
know
the
soothings
of
sleep
she
still
mused
on
the
late
occurrence
and
looked
with
anxiety
to
the
next
night
when
at
the
same
hour
she
determined
to
watch
whether
the
music
returned
â€œif
those
sounds
were
humanâ€
said
she
â€œi
shall
probably
hear
them
againâ€
then
oh
you
blessed
ministers
above
keep
me
in
patience
and
in
ripenâ€™d
time
unfold
the
evil
which
is
here
wrapt
up
in
countenance
shakespeare
annette
came
almost
breathless
to
emilyâ€™s
apartment
in
the
morning
â€œo
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
she
in
broken
sentences
â€œwhat
news
i
have
to
tell
i
have
found
out
who
the
prisoner
isâ€”but
he
was
no
prisoner
neitherâ€”he
that
was
shut
up
in
the
chamber
i
told
you
of
i
must
think
him
a
ghost
forsoothâ€
â€œwho
was
the
prisonerâ€
enquired
emily
while
her
thoughts
glanced
back
to
the
circumstance
of
the
preceding
night
â€œyou
mistake
maâ€™amâ€
said
annette
â€œhe
was
not
a
prisoner
after
allâ€
â€œwho
is
the
person
thenâ€
â€œholy
saintsâ€
rejoined
annette
â€œhow
i
was
surprised
i
met
him
just
now
on
the
rampart
below
there
i
never
was
so
surprised
in
my
life
ah
maâ€™amselle
this
is
a
strange
place
i
should
never
have
done
wondering
if
i
was
to
live
here
a
hundred
years
but
as
i
was
saying
i
met
him
just
now
on
the
rampart
and
i
was
thinking
of
nobody
less
than
of
himâ€
â€œthis
trifling
is
insupportableâ€
said
emily
â€œprâ€™ythee
annette
do
not
torture
my
patience
any
longerâ€
â€œnay
maâ€™amselle
guessâ€”guess
who
it
was
it
was
somebody
you
know
very
wellâ€
â€œi
cannot
guessâ€
said
emily
impatiently
â€œnay
maâ€™amselle
iâ€™ll
tell
you
something
to
guess
byâ€”a
tall
signor
with
a
longish
face
who
walks
so
stately
and
used
to
wear
such
a
high
feather
in
his
hat
and
used
often
to
look
down
upon
the
ground
when
people
spoke
to
him
and
to
look
at
people
from
under
his
eyebrows
as
it
were
all
so
dark
and
frowning
you
have
seen
him
often
and
often
at
venice
maâ€™am
then
he
was
so
intimate
with
the
signor
too
and
now
i
think
of
it
i
wonder
what
he
could
be
afraid
of
in
this
lonely
old
castle
that
he
should
shut
himself
up
for
but
he
is
come
abroad
now
for
i
met
him
on
the
rampart
just
this
minute
i
trembled
when
i
saw
him
for
i
always
was
afraid
of
him
somehow
but
i
determined
i
would
not
let
him
see
it
so
i
went
up
to
him
and
made
him
a
low
curtesy
â€˜you
are
welcome
to
the
castle
signor
orsinoâ€™
said
iâ€
â€œo
it
was
signor
orsino
thenâ€
said
emily
â€œyes
maâ€™amselle
signor
orsino
himself
who
caused
that
venetian
gentleman
to
be
killed
and
has
been
popping
about
from
place
to
place
ever
since
as
i
hearâ€
â€œgood
godâ€
exclaimed
emily
recovering
from
the
shock
of
this
intelligence
â€œand
is
he
come
to
udolpho
he
does
well
to
endeavour
to
conceal
himselfâ€
â€œyes
maâ€™amselle
but
if
that
was
all
this
desolate
place
would
conceal
him
without
his
shutting
himself
up
in
one
room
who
would
think
of
coming
to
look
for
him
here
i
am
sure
i
should
as
soon
think
of
going
to
look
for
anybody
in
the
other
worldâ€
â€œthere
is
some
truth
in
thatâ€
said
emily
who
would
now
have
concluded
it
was
orsinoâ€™s
music
which
she
had
heard
on
the
preceding
night
had
she
not
known
that
he
had
neither
taste
nor
skill
in
the
art
but
though
she
was
unwilling
to
add
to
the
number
of
annetteâ€™s
surprises
by
mentioning
the
subject
of
her
own
she
enquired
whether
any
person
in
the
castle
played
on
a
musical
instrument
â€œo
yes
maâ€™amselle
there
is
benedetto
plays
the
great
drum
to
admiration
and
then
there
is
launcelot
the
trumpeter
nay
for
that
matter
ludovico
himself
can
play
on
the
trumpetâ€”but
he
is
ill
now
i
remember
onceâ€”â€
emily
interrupted
her
â€œhave
you
heard
no
other
music
since
you
came
to
the
castleâ€”none
last
nightâ€
â€œwhy
did
you
hear
any
last
night
maâ€™amselleâ€
emily
evaded
this
question
by
repeating
her
own
â€œwhy
no
maâ€™amâ€
replied
annette
â€œi
never
heard
any
music
here
i
must
say
but
the
drums
and
the
trumpet
and
as
for
last
night
i
did
nothing
but
dream
i
saw
my
late
ladyâ€™s
ghostâ€
â€œyour
late
ladyâ€™sâ€
said
emily
in
a
tremulous
voice
â€œyou
have
heard
more
then
tell
meâ€”tell
me
all
annette
i
entreat
tell
me
the
worst
at
onceâ€
â€œnay
maâ€™amselle
you
know
the
worst
alreadyâ€
â€œi
know
nothingâ€
said
emily
â€œyes
you
do
maâ€™amselle
you
know
that
nobody
knows
anything
about
her
and
it
is
plain
therefore
she
is
gone
the
way
of
the
first
lady
of
the
castleâ€”nobody
ever
knew
anything
about
herâ€
emily
leaned
her
head
upon
her
hand
and
was
for
some
time
silent
then
telling
annette
she
wished
to
be
alone
the
latter
left
the
room
the
remark
of
annette
had
revived
emilyâ€™s
terrible
suspicion
concerning
the
fate
of
madame
montoni
and
she
resolved
to
make
another
effort
to
obtain
certainty
on
this
subject
by
applying
to
montoni
once
more
when
annette
returned
a
few
hours
after
she
told
emily
that
the
porter
of
the
castle
wished
very
much
to
speak
with
her
for
that
he
had
something
of
importance
to
say
her
spirits
had
however
of
late
been
so
subject
to
alarm
that
any
new
circumstance
excited
it
and
this
message
from
the
porter
when
her
first
surprise
was
over
made
her
look
round
for
some
lurking
danger
the
more
suspiciously
perhaps
because
she
had
frequently
remarked
the
unpleasant
air
and
countenance
of
this
man
she
now
hesitated
whether
to
speak
with
him
doubting
even
that
this
request
was
only
a
pretext
to
draw
her
into
some
danger
but
a
little
reflection
showed
her
the
improbability
of
this
and
she
blushed
at
her
weak
fears
â€œi
will
speak
to
him
annetteâ€
said
she
â€œdesire
him
to
come
to
the
corridor
immediatelyâ€
annette
departed
and
soon
after
returned
â€œbarnardine
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
she
â€œdare
not
come
to
the
corridor
lest
he
should
be
discovered
it
is
so
far
from
his
post
and
he
dare
not
even
leave
the
gates
for
a
moment
now
but
if
you
will
come
to
him
at
the
portal
through
some
roundabout
passages
he
told
me
of
without
crossing
the
courts
he
has
that
to
tell
which
will
surprise
you
but
you
must
not
come
through
the
courts
lest
the
signor
should
see
youâ€
emily
neither
approving
these
â€œroundabout
passageâ€
nor
the
other
part
of
the
request
now
positively
refused
to
go
â€œtell
himâ€
said
she
â€œif
he
has
anything
of
consequence
to
impart
i
will
hear
him
in
the
corridor
whenever
he
has
an
opportunity
of
coming
thitherâ€
annette
went
to
deliver
this
message
and
was
absent
a
considerable
time
when
she
returned
â€œit
wonâ€™t
do
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
she
â€œbarnardine
has
been
considering
all
this
time
what
can
be
done
for
it
is
as
much
as
his
place
is
worth
to
leave
his
post
now
but
if
you
will
come
to
the
east
rampart
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
he
can
perhaps
steal
away
and
tell
you
all
he
has
to
sayâ€
emily
was
surprised
and
alarmed
at
the
secrecy
which
this
man
seemed
to
think
so
necessary
and
hesitated
whether
to
meet
him
till
considering
that
he
might
mean
to
warn
her
of
some
serious
danger
she
resolved
to
go
â€œsoon
after
sunsetâ€
said
she
â€œi
will
be
at
the
end
of
the
east
rampart
but
then
the
watch
will
be
setâ€
she
added
recollecting
herself
â€œand
how
can
barnardine
pass
unobservedâ€
â€œthat
is
just
what
i
said
to
him
maâ€™am
and
he
answered
me
that
he
had
the
key
of
the
gate
at
the
end
of
the
rampart
that
leads
towards
the
courts
and
could
let
himself
through
that
way
and
as
for
the
sentinels
there
were
none
at
this
end
of
the
terrace
because
the
place
is
guarded
enough
by
the
high
walls
of
the
castle
and
the
east
turret
and
he
said
those
at
the
other
end
were
too
far
off
to
see
him
if
it
was
pretty
duskyishâ€
â€œwellâ€
said
emily
â€œi
must
hear
what
he
has
to
tell
and
therefore
desire
you
will
go
with
me
to
the
terrace
this
eveningâ€
â€œhe
desired
it
might
be
pretty
duskyish
maâ€™amselleâ€
repeated
annette
â€œbecause
of
the
watchâ€
emily
paused
and
then
said
she
would
be
on
the
terrace
an
hour
after
sunsetâ€”â€œand
tell
barnardineâ€
she
added
â€œto
be
punctual
to
the
time
for
that
i
also
may
be
observed
by
signor
montoni
where
is
the
signor
i
would
speak
with
himâ€
â€œhe
is
in
the
cedar
chamber
maâ€™am
counselling
with
the
other
signors
he
is
going
to
give
them
a
sort
of
treat
today
to
make
up
for
what
passed
at
the
last
i
suppose
the
people
are
all
very
busy
in
the
kitchenâ€
emily
now
enquired
if
montoni
expected
any
new
guests
and
annette
believed
that
he
did
not
â€œpoor
ludovicoâ€
added
she
â€œhe
would
be
as
merry
as
the
best
of
them
if
he
was
well
but
he
may
recover
yet
count
morano
was
wounded
as
bad
as
he
and
he
is
got
well
again
and
is
gone
back
to
veniceâ€
â€œis
he
soâ€
said
emily
â€œwhen
did
you
hear
thisâ€
â€œi
heard
it
last
night
maâ€™amselle
but
i
forgot
to
tell
itâ€
emily
asked
some
further
questions
and
then
desiring
annette
would
observe
and
inform
her
when
montoni
was
alone
the
girl
went
to
deliver
her
message
to
barnardine
montoni
was
however
so
much
engaged
during
the
whole
day
that
emily
had
no
opportunity
of
seeking
a
release
from
her
terrible
suspense
concerning
her
aunt
annette
was
employed
in
watching
his
steps
and
in
attending
upon
ludovico
whom
she
assisted
by
caterina
nursed
with
the
utmost
care
and
emily
was
of
course
left
much
alone
her
thoughts
dwelt
often
on
the
message
of
the
porter
and
were
employed
in
conjecturing
the
subject
that
occasioned
it
which
she
sometimes
imagined
concerned
the
fate
of
madame
montoni
at
others
that
it
related
to
some
personal
danger
which
threatened
herself
the
cautious
secrecy
which
barnardine
observed
in
his
conduct
inclined
her
to
believe
the
latter
as
the
hour
of
appointment
drew
near
her
impatience
increased
at
length
the
sun
set
she
heard
the
passing
steps
of
the
sentinels
going
to
their
posts
and
waited
only
for
annette
to
accompany
her
to
the
terrace
who
soon
after
came
and
they
descended
together
when
emily
expressed
apprehensions
of
meeting
montoni
or
some
of
his
guests
â€œo
there
is
no
fear
of
that
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œthey
are
all
set
in
to
feasting
yet
and
that
barnardine
knowsâ€
they
reached
the
first
terrace
where
the
sentinels
demanded
who
passed
and
emily
having
answered
walked
on
to
the
east
rampart
at
the
entrance
of
which
they
were
again
stopped
and
having
again
replied
were
permitted
to
proceed
but
emily
did
not
like
to
expose
herself
to
the
discretion
of
these
men
at
such
an
hour
and
impatient
to
withdraw
from
the
situation
she
stepped
hastily
on
in
search
of
barnardine
he
was
not
yet
come
she
leaned
pensively
on
the
wall
of
the
rampart
and
waited
for
him
the
gloom
of
twilight
sat
deep
on
the
surrounding
objects
blending
in
soft
confusion
the
valley
the
mountains
and
the
woods
whose
tall
heads
stirred
by
the
evening
breeze
gave
the
only
sounds
that
stole
on
silence
except
a
faint
faint
chorus
of
distant
voices
that
arose
from
within
the
castle
â€œwhat
voices
are
thoseâ€
said
emily
as
she
fearfully
listened
â€œit
is
only
the
signor
and
his
guests
carousingâ€
replied
annette
â€œgood
godâ€
thought
emily
â€œcan
this
manâ€™s
heart
be
so
gay
when
he
has
made
another
being
so
wretched
if
indeed
my
aunt
is
yet
suffered
to
feel
her
wretchedness
o
whatever
are
my
own
sufferings
may
my
heart
never
never
be
hardened
against
those
of
othersâ€
she
looked
up
with
a
sensation
of
horror
to
the
east
turret
near
which
she
then
stood
a
light
glimmered
through
the
grates
of
the
lower
chamber
but
those
of
the
upper
one
were
dark
presently
she
perceived
a
person
moving
with
a
lamp
across
the
lower
room
but
this
circumstance
revived
no
hope
concerning
madame
montoni
whom
she
had
vainly
sought
in
that
apartment
which
had
appeared
to
contain
only
soldiersâ€™
accoutrements
emily
however
determined
to
attempt
the
outer
door
of
the
turret
as
soon
as
barnardine
should
withdraw
and
if
it
was
unfastened
to
make
another
effort
to
discover
her
aunt
the
moments
passed
but
still
barnardine
did
not
appear
and
emily
becoming
uneasy
hesitated
whether
to
wait
any
longer
she
would
have
sent
annette
to
the
portal
to
hasten
him
but
feared
to
be
left
alone
for
it
was
now
almost
dark
and
a
melancholy
streak
of
red
that
still
lingered
in
the
west
was
the
only
vestige
of
departed
day
the
strong
interest
however
which
barnardineâ€™s
message
had
awakened
overcame
other
apprehensions
and
still
detained
her
while
she
was
conjecturing
with
annette
what
could
thus
occasion
his
absence
they
heard
a
key
turn
in
the
lock
of
the
gate
near
them
and
presently
saw
a
man
advancing
it
was
barnardine
of
whom
emily
hastily
enquired
what
he
had
to
communicate
and
desired
that
he
would
tell
her
quickly
â€œfor
i
am
chilled
with
this
evening
airâ€
said
she
â€œyou
must
dismiss
your
maid
ladyâ€
said
the
man
in
a
voice
the
deep
tone
of
which
shocked
her
â€œwhat
i
have
to
tell
is
to
you
onlyâ€
emily
after
some
hesitation
desired
annette
to
withdraw
to
a
little
distance
â€œnow
my
friend
what
would
you
sayâ€
he
was
silent
a
moment
as
if
considering
and
then
saidâ€”
â€œthat
which
would
cost
me
my
place
at
least
if
it
came
to
the
signorâ€™s
ears
you
must
promise
lady
that
nothing
shall
ever
make
you
tell
a
syllable
of
the
matter
i
have
been
trusted
in
this
affair
and
if
it
was
known
that
i
betrayed
my
trust
my
life
perhaps
might
answer
it
but
i
was
concerned
for
you
lady
and
i
resolved
to
tell
youâ€
he
pausedâ€”
emily
thanked
him
assured
him
that
he
might
repose
on
her
discretion
and
entreated
him
to
dispatch
â€œannette
told
us
in
the
hall
how
unhappy
you
were
about
signora
montoni
and
how
much
you
wished
to
know
what
was
become
of
herâ€
â€œmost
trueâ€
said
emily
eagerly
â€œand
you
can
inform
me
i
conjure
you
tell
me
the
worst
without
hesitationâ€
she
rested
her
trembling
arm
upon
the
wall
â€œi
can
tell
youâ€
said
barnardine
and
pausedâ€”
emily
had
no
power
to
enforce
her
entreaties
â€œi
can
tell
youâ€
resumed
barnardineâ€”â€œbutâ€”â€
â€œbut
whatâ€
exclaimed
emily
recovering
her
resolution
â€œhere
i
am
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
who
having
heard
the
eager
tone
in
which
emily
pronounced
these
words
came
running
towards
her
â€œretireâ€
said
barnardine
sternly
â€œyou
are
not
wantedâ€
and
as
emily
said
nothing
annette
obeyed
â€œi
can
tell
youâ€
repeated
the
porterâ€”â€œbut
i
know
not
howâ€”you
were
afflicted
beforeâ€”â€
â€œi
am
prepared
for
the
worst
my
friendâ€
said
emily
in
a
firm
and
solemn
voice
â€œi
can
support
any
certainty
better
than
this
suspenseâ€
â€œwell
signora
if
that
is
the
case
you
shall
hearâ€”you
know
i
suppose
that
the
signor
and
his
lady
used
sometimes
to
disagree
it
is
none
of
my
concerns
to
enquire
what
it
was
about
but
i
believe
you
know
it
was
soâ€
â€œwellâ€
said
emily
â€œproceedâ€
â€œthe
signor
it
seems
had
lately
been
very
wrath
against
her
i
saw
all
and
heard
allâ€”a
great
deal
more
than
people
thought
for
but
it
was
none
of
my
business
so
i
said
nothing
a
few
days
ago
the
signor
sent
for
me
â€˜barnardineâ€™
says
he
â€˜you
areâ€”an
honest
man
i
think
i
can
trust
youâ€™
i
assured
his
excellenza
that
he
could
â€˜thenâ€™
says
he
as
near
as
i
can
remember
â€˜i
have
an
affair
in
hand
which
i
want
you
to
assist
me
inâ€™â€”then
he
told
me
what
i
was
to
do
but
that
i
shall
say
nothing
aboutâ€”it
concerned
only
the
signoraâ€
â€œo
heavensâ€
exclaimed
emilyâ€”â€œwhat
have
you
doneâ€
barnardine
hesitated
and
was
silent
â€œwhat
fiend
could
tempt
him
or
you
to
such
an
actâ€
cried
emily
chilled
with
horror
and
scarcely
able
to
support
her
fainting
spirits
â€œit
was
a
fiendâ€
said
barnardine
in
a
gloomy
tone
of
voice
they
were
now
both
silentâ€”emily
had
not
courage
to
enquire
further
and
barnardine
seemed
to
shrink
from
telling
more
at
length
he
said
â€œit
is
of
no
use
to
think
of
the
past
the
signor
was
cruel
enough
but
he
would
be
obeyed
what
signified
my
refusing
he
would
have
found
others
who
had
no
scruplesâ€
â€œyou
have
murdered
her
thenâ€
said
emily
in
a
hollow
and
inward
voiceâ€”â€œi
am
talking
with
a
murdererâ€
barnardine
stood
silent
while
emily
turned
from
him
and
attempted
to
leave
the
place
â€œstay
ladyâ€
said
he
â€œyou
deserve
to
think
so
stillâ€”since
you
can
believe
me
capable
of
such
a
deedâ€
â€œif
you
are
innocent
tell
me
quicklyâ€
said
emily
in
faint
accents
â€œfor
i
feel
i
shall
not
be
able
to
hear
you
longâ€
â€œi
will
tell
you
no
moreâ€
said
he
and
walked
away
emily
had
just
strength
enough
to
bid
him
stay
and
then
to
call
annette
on
whose
arm
she
leaned
and
they
walked
slowly
up
the
rampart
till
they
heard
steps
behind
them
it
was
barnardine
again
â€œsend
away
the
girlâ€
said
he
â€œand
i
will
tell
you
moreâ€
â€œshe
must
not
goâ€
said
emily
â€œwhat
you
have
to
say
she
may
hearâ€
â€œmay
she
so
ladyâ€
said
he
â€œyou
shall
know
no
more
thenâ€
and
he
was
going
though
slowly
when
emilyâ€™s
anxiety
overcoming
the
resentment
and
fear
which
the
manâ€™s
behaviour
had
roused
she
desired
him
to
stay
and
bade
annette
retire
â€œthe
signora
is
aliveâ€
said
he
â€œfor
me
she
is
my
prisoner
though
his
excellenza
has
shut
her
up
in
the
chamber
over
the
great
gates
of
the
court
and
i
have
the
charge
of
her
i
was
going
to
have
told
you
you
might
see
herâ€”but
nowâ€”â€
emily
relieved
from
an
unutterable
load
of
anguish
by
this
speech
had
now
only
to
ask
barnardineâ€™s
forgiveness
and
to
conjure
that
he
would
let
her
visit
her
aunt
he
complied
with
less
reluctance
than
she
expected
and
told
her
that
if
she
would
repair
on
the
following
night
when
the
signor
was
retired
to
rest
to
the
postern-gate
of
the
castle
she
should
perhaps
see
madame
montoni
amid
all
the
thankfulness
which
emily
felt
for
this
concession
she
thought
she
observed
a
malicious
triumph
in
his
manner
when
he
pronounced
the
last
words
but
in
the
next
moment
she
dismissed
the
thought
and
having
again
thanked
him
commended
her
aunt
to
his
pity
and
assured
him
that
she
would
herself
reward
him
and
would
be
punctual
to
her
appointment
she
bade
him
good
night
and
retired
unobserved
to
her
chamber
it
was
a
considerable
time
before
the
tumult
of
joy
which
barnardineâ€™s
unexpected
intelligence
had
occasioned
allowed
emily
to
think
with
clearness
or
to
be
conscious
of
the
real
dangers
that
still
surrounded
madame
montoni
and
herself
when
this
agitation
subsided
she
perceived
that
her
aunt
was
yet
the
prisoner
of
a
man
to
whose
vengeance
or
avarice
she
might
fall
a
sacrifice
and
when
she
further
considered
the
savage
aspect
of
the
person
who
was
appointed
to
guard
madame
montoni
her
doom
appeared
to
be
already
sealed
for
the
countenance
of
barnardine
seemed
to
bear
the
stamp
of
a
murderer
and
when
she
had
looked
upon
it
she
felt
inclined
to
believe
that
there
was
no
deed
however
black
which
he
might
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
execute
these
reflections
brought
to
her
remembrance
the
tone
of
voice
in
which
he
had
promised
to
grant
her
request
to
see
his
prisoner
and
she
mused
upon
it
long
in
uneasiness
and
doubt
sometimes
she
even
hesitated
whether
to
trust
herself
with
him
at
the
lonely
hour
he
had
appointed
and
once
and
only
once
it
struck
her
that
madame
montoni
might
be
already
murdered
and
that
this
ruffian
was
appointed
to
decoy
herself
to
some
secret
place
where
her
life
also
was
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
avarice
of
montoni
who
then
would
claim
securely
the
contested
estates
in
languedoc
the
consideration
of
the
enormity
of
such
guilt
did
at
length
relieve
her
from
the
belief
of
its
probability
but
not
from
all
the
doubts
and
fears
which
a
recollection
of
barnardineâ€™s
manner
had
occasioned
from
these
subjects
her
thoughts
at
length
passed
to
others
and
as
the
evening
advanced
she
remembered
with
somewhat
more
than
surprise
the
music
she
had
heard
on
the
preceding
night
and
now
awaited
its
return
with
more
than
curiosity
she
distinguished
till
a
late
hour
the
distant
carousals
of
montoni
and
his
companionsâ€”the
loud
contest
the
dissolute
laugh
and
the
choral
song
that
made
the
halls
re-echo
at
length
she
heard
the
heavy
gates
of
the
castle
shut
for
the
night
and
those
sounds
instantly
sunk
into
a
silence
which
was
disturbed
only
by
the
whispering
steps
of
persons
passing
through
the
galleries
to
their
remote
rooms
emily
now
judging
it
to
be
about
the
time
when
she
had
heard
the
music
on
the
preceding
night
dismissed
annette
and
gently
opened
the
casement
to
watch
for
its
return
the
planet
she
had
so
particularly
noticed
at
the
recurrence
of
the
music
was
not
yet
risen
but
with
superstitious
weakness
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
that
part
of
the
hemisphere
where
it
would
rise
almost
expecting
that
when
it
appeared
the
sounds
would
return
at
length
it
came
serenely
bright
over
the
eastern
towers
of
the
castle
her
heart
trembled
when
she
perceived
it
and
she
had
scarcely
courage
to
remain
at
the
casement
lest
the
returning
music
should
confirm
her
terror
and
subdue
the
little
strength
she
yet
retained
the
clock
soon
after
struck
one
and
knowing
this
to
be
about
the
time
when
the
sounds
had
occurred
she
sat
down
in
a
chair
near
the
casement
and
endeavoured
to
compose
her
spirits
but
the
anxiety
of
expectation
yet
disturbed
them
everything
however
remained
still
she
heard
only
the
solitary
step
of
a
sentinel
and
the
lulling
murmur
of
the
woods
below
and
she
again
leaned
from
the
casement
and
again
looked
as
if
for
intelligence
to
the
planet
which
was
now
risen
high
above
the
towers
emily
continued
to
listen
but
no
music
came
â€œthose
were
surely
no
mortal
soundsâ€
said
she
recollecting
their
entrancing
melody
â€œno
inhabitant
of
this
castle
could
utter
such
and
where
is
the
feeling
that
could
modulate
such
exquisite
expression
we
all
know
that
it
has
been
affirmed
celestial
sounds
have
sometimes
been
heard
on
earth
father
pierre
and
father
antoine
declared
that
they
had
sometimes
heard
them
in
the
stillness
of
night
when
they
alone
were
waking
to
offer
their
orisons
to
heaven
nay
my
dear
father
himself
once
said
that
soon
after
my
motherâ€™s
death
as
he
lay
watchful
in
grief
sounds
of
uncommon
sweetness
called
him
from
his
bed
and
on
opening
his
window
he
heard
lofty
music
pass
along
the
midnight
air
it
soothed
him
he
said
he
looked
up
with
confidence
to
heaven
and
resigned
her
to
his
godâ€
emily
paused
to
weep
at
this
recollection
â€œperhapsâ€
resumed
she
â€œperhaps
those
strains
i
heard
were
sent
to
comfortâ€”to
encourage
me
never
shall
i
forget
those
i
heard
at
this
hour
in
languedoc
perhaps
my
father
watches
over
me
at
this
momentâ€
she
wept
again
in
tenderness
thus
passed
the
hour
in
watchfulness
and
solemn
thought
but
no
sounds
returned
and
after
remaining
at
the
casement
till
the
light
tint
of
dawn
began
to
edge
the
mountain-tops
and
steal
upon
the
night-shade
she
concluded
that
they
would
not
return
and
retired
reluctantly
to
repose

macbeth
emily
was
somewhat
surprised
on
the
following
day
to
find
that
annette
had
heard
of
madame
montoniâ€™s
confinement
in
the
chamber
over
the
portal
as
well
as
of
her
purposed
visit
there
on
the
approaching
night
that
the
circumstance
which
barnardine
had
so
solemnly
enjoined
her
to
conceal
he
had
himself
told
to
so
indiscreet
a
hearer
as
annette
appeared
very
improbable
though
he
had
now
charged
her
with
a
message
concerning
the
intended
interview
he
requested
that
emily
would
meet
him
unattended
on
the
terrace
at
a
little
after
midnight
when
he
himself
would
lead
her
to
the
place
he
had
promised
a
proposal
from
which
she
immediately
shrunk
for
a
thousand
vague
fears
darted
athwart
her
mind
such
as
had
tormented
her
on
the
preceding
night
and
which
she
neither
knew
how
to
trust
nor
to
dismiss
it
frequently
occurred
to
her
that
barnardine
might
have
deceived
her
concerning
madame
montoni
whose
murderer
perhaps
he
really
was
and
that
he
had
deceived
her
by
order
of
montoni
the
more
easily
to
draw
her
into
some
of
the
desperate
designs
of
the
latter
the
terrible
suspicion
that
madame
montoni
no
longer
lived
thus
came
accompanied
by
one
not
less
dreadful
for
herself
unless
the
crime
by
which
the
aunt
had
suffered
was
instigated
merely
by
resentment
unconnected
with
profit
a
motive
upon
which
montoni
did
not
appear
very
likely
to
act
its
object
must
be
unattained
till
the
niece
was
also
dead
to
whom
montoni
knew
that
his
wifeâ€™s
estates
must
descend
emily
remembered
the
words
which
had
informed
her
that
the
contested
estates
in
france
would
devolve
to
her
if
madame
montoni
died
without
consigning
them
to
her
husband
and
the
former
obstinate
perseverance
of
her
aunt
made
it
too
probable
that
she
had
to
the
last
withheld
them
at
this
instant
recollecting
barnardineâ€™s
manner
on
the
preceding
night
she
now
believed
what
she
had
then
fancied
that
it
expressed
malignant
triumph
she
shuddered
at
the
recollection
which
confirmed
her
fears
and
determined
not
to
meet
him
on
the
terrace
soon
after
she
was
inclined
to
consider
these
suspicions
as
the
extravagant
exaggerations
of
a
timid
and
harassed
mind
and
could
not
believe
montoni
liable
to
such
preposterous
depravity
as
that
of
destroying
from
one
motive
his
wife
and
her
niece
she
blamed
herself
for
suffering
her
romantic
imagination
to
carry
her
so
far
beyond
the
bounds
of
probability
and
determined
to
endeavour
to
check
its
rapid
flights
lest
they
should
sometimes
extend
into
madness
still
however
she
shrunk
from
the
thought
of
meeting
barnardine
on
the
terrace
at
midnight
and
still
the
wish
to
be
relieved
from
this
terrible
suspense
concerning
her
aunt
to
see
her
and
to
sooth
her
sufferings
made
her
hesitate
what
to
do
â€œyet
how
is
it
possible
annette
i
can
pass
to
the
terrace
at
that
hourâ€
said
she
recollecting
herself
â€œthe
sentinels
will
stop
me
and
signor
montoni
will
hear
of
the
affairâ€
â€œo
maâ€™amselle
that
is
well
thought
ofâ€
replied
annette
â€œthat
is
what
barnardine
told
me
about
he
gave
me
this
key
and
bade
me
say
it
unlocks
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
vaulted
gallery
that
opens
near
the
end
of
the
east
rampart
so
that
you
need
not
pass
any
of
the
men
on
watch
he
bade
me
say
too
that
his
reason
for
requesting
you
to
come
to
the
terrace
was
because
he
could
take
you
to
the
place
you
want
to
go
to
without
opening
the
great
doors
of
the
hall
which
grate
so
heavilyâ€
emilyâ€™s
spirits
were
somewhat
calmed
by
this
explanation
which
seemed
to
be
honestly
given
to
annette
â€œbut
why
did
he
desire
i
would
come
alone
annetteâ€
said
she
â€œwhy
that
was
what
i
asked
him
myself
maâ€™amselle
says
i
â€˜why
is
my
young
lady
to
come
aloneâ€”surely
i
may
come
with
herâ€”what
harm
can
i
doâ€™
but
he
said
â€˜noâ€”noâ€”i
tell
you
notâ€™
in
his
gruff
way
nay
says
i
i
have
been
trusted
in
as
great
affairs
as
this
i
warrant
and
itâ€™s
a
hard
matter
if
i
canâ€™t
keep
a
secret
now
still
he
would
say
nothing
butâ€”â€˜noâ€”noâ€”noâ€™
well
says
i
if
you
will
only
trust
me
i
will
tell
you
a
great
secret
that
was
told
me
a
month
ago
and
i
have
never
opened
my
lips
about
it
yetâ€”so
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
telling
me
but
all
would
not
do
then
maâ€™amselle
i
went
so
far
as
to
offer
him
a
beautiful
new
sequin
that
ludovico
gave
me
for
a
keepsake
and
i
would
not
have
parted
with
it
for
all
st
marcoâ€™s
place
but
even
that
would
not
do
now
what
can
be
the
reason
of
this
but
i
know
you
know
maâ€™am
who
you
are
going
to
seeâ€
â€œpray
did
barnardine
tell
you
thisâ€
â€œhe
no
maâ€™amselle
that
he
did
notâ€
emily
enquired
who
did
but
annette
showed
that
she
could
keep
a
secret
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
emilyâ€™s
mind
was
agitated
with
doubts
and
fears
and
contrary
determinations
on
the
subject
of
meeting
this
barnardine
on
the
rampart
and
submitting
herself
to
his
guidance
she
scarcely
knew
whither
pity
for
her
aunt
and
anxiety
for
herself
alternately
swayed
her
determination
and
night
came
before
she
had
decided
upon
her
conduct
she
heard
the
castle
clock
strike
elevenâ€”twelveâ€”and
yet
her
mind
wavered
the
time
however
was
now
come
when
she
could
hesitate
no
longer
and
then
the
interest
she
felt
for
her
aunt
overcame
other
considerations
and
bidding
annette
follow
her
to
the
outer
door
of
the
vaulted
gallery
and
there
await
her
return
she
descended
from
her
chamber
the
castle
was
perfectly
still
and
the
great
hall
where
so
lately
she
had
witnessed
a
scene
of
dreadful
contention
now
returned
only
the
whispering
footsteps
of
the
two
solitary
figures
gliding
fearfully
between
the
pillars
and
gleamed
only
to
the
feeble
lamp
they
carried
emily
deceived
by
the
long
shadows
of
the
pillars
and
by
the
catching
lights
between
often
stopped
imagining
she
saw
some
person
moving
in
the
distant
obscurity
of
the
perspective
and
as
she
passed
these
pillars
she
feared
to
turn
her
eyes
toward
them
almost
expecting
to
see
a
figure
start
out
from
behind
their
broad
shaft
she
reached
however
the
vaulted
gallery
without
interruption
but
unclosed
its
outer
door
with
a
trembling
hand
and
charging
annette
not
to
quit
it
and
to
keep
it
a
little
open
that
she
might
be
heard
if
she
called
she
delivered
to
her
the
lamp
which
she
did
not
dare
to
take
herself
because
of
the
men
on
watch
and
alone
stepped
out
upon
the
dark
terrace
everything
was
so
still
that
she
feared
lest
her
own
light
steps
should
be
heard
by
the
distant
sentinels
and
she
walked
cautiously
towards
the
spot
where
she
had
before
met
barnardine
listening
for
a
sound
and
looking
onward
through
the
gloom
in
search
of
him
at
length
she
was
startled
by
a
deep
voice
that
spoke
near
her
and
she
paused
uncertain
whether
it
was
his
till
it
spoke
again
and
she
then
recognised
the
hollow
tones
of
barnardine
who
had
been
punctual
to
the
moment
and
was
at
the
appointed
place
resting
on
the
rampart
wall
after
chiding
her
for
not
coming
sooner
and
saying
that
he
had
been
waiting
nearly
half
an
hour
he
desired
emily
who
made
no
reply
to
follow
him
to
the
door
through
which
he
had
entered
the
terrace
while
he
unlocked
it
she
looked
back
to
that
she
had
left
and
observing
the
rays
of
the
lamp
stream
through
a
small
opening
was
certain
that
annette
was
still
there
but
her
remote
situation
could
little
befriend
emily
after
she
had
quitted
the
terrace
and
when
barnardine
unclosed
the
gate
the
dismal
aspect
of
the
passage
beyond
shown
by
a
torch
burning
on
the
pavement
made
her
shrink
from
following
him
alone
and
she
refused
to
go
unless
annette
might
accompany
her
this
however
barnardine
absolutely
refused
to
permit
mingling
at
the
same
time
with
his
refusal
such
artful
circumstances
to
heighten
the
pity
and
curiosity
of
emily
towards
her
aunt
that
she
at
length
consented
to
follow
him
alone
to
the
portal
he
then
took
up
the
torch
and
led
her
along
the
passage
at
the
extremity
of
which
he
unlocked
another
door
whence
they
descended
a
few
steps
into
a
chapel
which
as
barnardine
held
up
the
torch
to
light
her
emily
observed
to
be
in
ruins
and
she
immediately
recollected
a
former
conversation
of
annette
concerning
it
with
very
unpleasant
emotions
she
looked
fearfully
on
the
almost
roofless
walls
green
with
damps
and
on
the
gothic
points
of
the
windows
where
the
ivy
and
the
briony
had
long
supplied
the
place
of
glass
and
ran
mantling
among
the
broken
capitals
of
some
columns
that
had
once
supported
the
roof
barnardine
stumbled
over
the
broken
pavement
and
his
voice
as
he
uttered
a
sudden
oath
was
returned
in
hollow
echoes
that
made
it
more
terrific
emilyâ€™s
heart
sunk
but
she
still
followed
him
and
he
turned
out
of
what
had
been
the
principal
aisle
of
the
chapel
â€œdown
these
steps
ladyâ€
said
barnardine
as
he
descended
a
flight
which
appeared
to
lead
into
the
vaults
but
emily
paused
on
the
top
and
demanded
in
a
tremulous
tone
whither
he
was
conducting
her
â€œto
the
portalâ€
said
barnardine
â€œcannot
we
go
through
the
chapel
to
the
portalâ€
said
emily
â€œno
signora
that
leads
to
the
inner
court
which
i
donâ€™t
choose
to
unlock
this
way
and
we
shall
reach
the
outer
court
presentlyâ€
emily
still
hesitated
fearing
not
only
to
go
on
but
since
she
had
gone
thus
far
to
irritate
barnardine
by
refusing
to
go
further
â€œcome
ladyâ€
said
the
man
who
had
nearly
reached
the
bottom
of
the
flight
â€œmake
a
little
haste
i
cannot
wait
here
all
nightâ€
â€œwhither
do
these
steps
leadâ€
said
emily
yet
pausing
â€œto
the
portalâ€
repeated
barnardine
in
an
angry
tone
â€œi
will
wait
no
longerâ€
as
he
said
this
he
moved
on
with
the
light
and
emily
fearing
to
provoke
him
by
further
delay
reluctantly
followed
from
the
steps
they
proceeded
through
a
passage
adjoining
the
vaults
the
walls
of
which
were
dropping
with
unwholesome
dews
and
the
vapours
that
crept
along
the
ground
made
the
torch
burn
so
dimly
that
emily
expected
every
moment
to
see
it
extinguished
and
barnardine
could
scarcely
find
his
way
as
they
advanced
these
vapours
thickened
and
barnardine
believing
the
torch
was
expiring
stopped
for
a
moment
to
trim
it
as
he
then
rested
against
a
pair
of
iron
gates
that
opened
from
the
passage
emily
saw
by
uncertain
flashes
of
light
the
vaults
beyond
and
near
her
heaps
of
earth
that
seemed
to
surround
an
open
grave
such
an
object
in
such
a
scene
would
at
any
time
have
disturbed
her
but
now
she
was
shocked
by
an
instantaneous
presentiment
that
this
was
the
grave
of
her
unfortunate
aunt
and
that
the
treacherous
barnardine
was
leading
herself
to
destruction
the
obscure
and
terrible
place
to
which
he
had
conducted
her
seemed
to
justify
the
thought
it
was
a
place
suited
for
murder
a
receptacle
for
the
dead
where
a
deed
of
horror
might
be
committed
and
no
vestige
appear
to
proclaim
it
emily
was
so
overwhelmed
with
terror
that
for
a
moment
she
was
unable
to
determine
what
conduct
to
pursue
she
then
considered
that
it
would
be
vain
to
attempt
an
escape
from
barnardine
by
flight
since
the
length
and
the
intricacy
of
the
way
she
had
passed
would
soon
enable
him
to
overtake
her
who
was
unacquainted
with
the
turnings
and
whose
feebleness
would
not
suffer
her
to
run
long
with
swiftness
she
feared
equally
to
irritate
him
by
a
disclosure
of
her
suspicions
which
a
refusal
to
accompany
him
further
certainly
would
do
and
since
she
was
already
as
much
in
his
power
as
it
was
possible
she
could
be
if
she
proceeded
she
at
length
determined
to
suppress
as
far
as
she
could
the
appearance
of
apprehension
and
to
follow
silently
whither
he
designed
to
lead
her
pale
with
horror
and
anxiety
she
now
waited
till
barnardine
had
trimmed
the
torch
and
as
her
sight
glanced
again
upon
the
grave
she
could
not
forbear
enquiring
for
whom
it
was
prepared
he
took
his
eyes
from
the
torch
and
fixed
them
upon
her
face
without
speaking
she
faintly
repeated
the
question
but
the
man
shaking
the
torch
passed
on
and
she
followed
trembling
to
a
second
flight
of
steps
having
ascended
which
a
door
delivered
them
into
the
first
court
of
the
castle
as
they
crossed
it
the
light
showed
the
high
black
walls
around
them
fringed
with
long
grass
and
dank
weeds
that
found
a
scanty
soil
among
the
mouldering
stones
the
heavy
buttresses
with
here
and
there
between
them
a
narrow
grate
that
admitted
a
freer
circulation
of
air
to
the
court
the
massy
iron
gates
that
led
to
the
castle
whose
clustering
turrets
appeared
above
and
opposite
the
huge
towers
and
arch
of
the
portal
itself
in
this
scene
the
large
uncouth
person
of
barnardine
bearing
the
torch
formed
a
characteristic
figure
this
barnardine
was
wrapt
in
a
long
dark
cloak
which
scarcely
allowed
the
kind
of
half-boots
or
sandals
that
were
laced
upon
his
legs
to
appear
and
showed
only
the
point
of
a
broad
sword
which
he
usually
wore
slung
in
a
belt
across
his
shoulders
on
his
head
was
a
heavy
flat
velvet
cap
somewhat
resembling
a
turban
in
which
was
a
short
feather
the
visage
beneath
it
showed
strong
features
and
a
countenance
furrowed
with
the
lines
of
cunning
and
darkened
by
habitual
discontent
the
view
of
the
court
however
reanimated
emily
who
as
she
crossed
silently
towards
the
portal
began
to
hope
that
her
own
fears
and
not
the
treachery
of
barnardine
had
deceived
her
she
looked
anxiously
up
at
the
first
casement
that
appeared
above
the
lofty
arch
of
the
portcullis
but
it
was
dark
and
she
enquired
whether
it
belonged
to
the
chamber
where
madame
montoni
was
confined
emily
spoke
low
and
barnardine
perhaps
did
not
hear
her
question
for
he
returned
no
answer
and
they
soon
after
entered
the
postern
door
of
the
gateway
which
brought
them
to
the
foot
of
a
narrow
staircase
that
wound
up
one
of
the
towers
â€œup
this
staircase
the
signora
liesâ€
said
barnardine
â€œliesâ€
repeated
emily
faintly
as
she
began
to
ascend
â€œshe
lies
in
the
upper
chamberâ€
said
barnardine
as
they
passed
up
the
wind
which
poured
through
the
narrow
cavities
in
the
wall
made
the
torch
flare
and
it
threw
a
stronger
gleam
upon
the
grim
and
sallow
countenance
of
barnardine
and
discovered
more
fully
the
desolation
of
the
placeâ€”the
rough
stone
walls
the
spiral
stairs
black
with
age
and
a
suit
of
ancient
armour
with
an
iron
visor
that
hung
upon
the
walls
and
appeared
a
trophy
of
some
former
victory
having
reached
a
landing-place
â€œyou
may
wait
here
ladyâ€
said
he
applying
a
key
to
the
door
of
a
chamber
â€œwhile
i
go
up
and
tell
the
signora
you
are
comingâ€
â€œthat
ceremony
is
unnecessaryâ€
replied
emily
â€œmy
aunt
will
rejoice
to
see
meâ€
â€œi
am
not
so
sure
of
thatâ€
said
barnardine
pointing
to
the
room
he
had
opened
â€œcome
in
here
lady
while
i
step
upâ€
emily
surprised
and
somewhat
shocked
did
not
dare
to
oppose
him
further
but
as
he
was
turning
away
with
the
torch
desired
he
would
not
leave
her
in
darkness
he
looked
around
and
observing
a
tripod
lamp
that
stood
on
the
stairs
lighted
and
gave
it
to
emily
who
stepped
forward
into
a
large
old
chamber
and
he
closed
the
door
as
she
listened
anxiously
to
his
departing
steps
she
thought
he
descended
instead
of
ascending
the
stairs
but
the
gusts
of
wind
that
whistled
round
the
portal
would
not
allow
her
to
hear
distinctly
any
other
sound
still
however
she
listened
and
perceiving
no
step
in
the
room
above
where
he
had
affirmed
madame
montoni
to
be
her
anxiety
increased
though
she
considered
that
the
thickness
of
the
floor
in
this
strong
building
might
prevent
any
sound
reaching
her
from
the
upper
chamber
the
next
moment
in
a
pause
of
the
wind
she
distinguished
barnardineâ€™s
step
descending
to
the
court
and
then
thought
she
heard
his
voice
but
the
rising
gust
again
overcoming
other
sounds
emily
to
be
certain
on
this
point
moved
softly
to
the
door
which
on
attempting
to
open
it
she
discovered
was
fastened
all
the
horrid
apprehensions
that
had
lately
assailed
her
returned
at
this
instant
with
redoubled
force
and
no
longer
appeared
like
the
exaggerations
of
a
timid
spirit
but
seemed
to
have
been
sent
to
warn
her
of
her
fate
she
now
did
not
doubt
that
madame
montoni
had
been
murdered
perhaps
in
this
very
chamber
or
that
she
herself
was
brought
hither
for
the
same
purpose
the
countenance
the
manners
and
the
recollected
words
of
barnardine
when
he
had
spoken
of
her
aunt
confirmed
her
worst
fears
for
some
moments
she
was
incapable
of
considering
of
any
means
by
which
she
might
attempt
an
escape
still
she
listened
but
heard
footsteps
neither
on
the
stairs
nor
in
the
room
above
she
thought
however
that
she
again
distinguished
barnardineâ€™s
voice
below
and
went
to
a
grated
window
that
opened
upon
the
court
to
enquire
further
here
she
plainly
heard
his
hoarse
accents
mingling
with
the
blast
that
swept
by
but
they
were
lost
again
so
quickly
that
their
meaning
could
not
be
interpreted
and
then
the
light
of
a
torch
which
seemed
to
issue
from
the
portal
below
flashed
across
the
court
and
the
long
shadow
of
a
man
who
was
under
the
arch-way
appeared
upon
the
pavement
emily
from
the
hugeness
of
this
sudden
portrait
concluded
it
to
be
that
of
barnardine
but
other
deep
tones
which
passed
in
the
wind
soon
convinced
her
he
was
not
alone
and
that
his
companion
was
not
a
person
very
liable
to
pity
when
her
spirits
had
overcome
the
first
shock
of
her
situation
she
held
up
the
lamp
to
examine
if
the
chamber
afforded
a
possibility
of
an
escape
it
was
a
spacious
room
whose
walls
wainscoted
with
rough
oak
showed
no
casement
but
the
grated
one
which
emily
had
left
and
no
other
door
than
that
by
which
she
had
entered
the
feeble
rays
of
the
lamp
however
did
not
allow
her
to
see
at
once
its
full
extent
she
perceived
no
furniture
except
indeed
an
iron
chair
fastened
in
the
centre
of
the
chamber
immediately
over
which
depending
on
a
chain
from
the
ceiling
hung
an
iron
ring
having
gazed
upon
these
for
some
time
with
wonder
and
horror
she
next
observed
iron
bars
below
made
for
the
purpose
of
confining
the
feet
and
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
were
rings
of
the
same
metal
as
she
continued
to
survey
them
she
concluded
that
they
were
instruments
of
torture
and
it
struck
her
that
some
poor
wretch
had
once
been
fastened
in
this
chair
and
had
there
been
starved
to
death
she
was
chilled
by
the
thought
but
what
was
her
agony
when
in
the
next
moment
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
aunt
might
have
been
one
of
these
victims
and
that
she
herself
might
be
the
next
an
acute
pain
seized
her
head
she
was
scarcely
able
to
hold
the
lamp
and
looking
round
for
support
was
seating
herself
unconsciously
in
the
iron
chair
itself
but
suddenly
perceiving
where
she
was
she
started
from
it
in
horror
and
sprung
towards
a
remote
end
of
the
room
here
again
she
looked
round
for
a
seat
to
sustain
her
and
perceived
only
a
dark
curtain
which
descending
from
the
ceiling
to
the
floor
was
drawn
along
the
whole
side
of
the
chamber
ill
as
she
was
the
appearance
of
this
curtain
struck
her
and
she
paused
to
gaze
upon
it
in
wonder
and
apprehension
it
seemed
to
conceal
a
recess
of
the
chamber
she
wished
yet
dreaded
to
lift
it
and
to
discover
what
it
veiled
twice
she
was
withheld
by
a
recollection
of
the
terrible
spectacle
her
daring
hand
had
formerly
unveiled
in
an
apartment
of
the
castle
till
suddenly
conjecturing
that
it
concealed
the
body
of
her
murdered
aunt
she
seized
it
in
a
fit
of
desperation
and
drew
it
aside
beyond
appeared
a
corpse
stretched
on
a
kind
of
low
couch
which
was
crimsoned
with
human
blood
as
was
the
floor
beneath
the
features
deformed
by
death
were
ghastly
and
horrible
and
more
than
one
livid
wound
appeared
in
the
face
emily
bending
over
the
body
gazed
for
a
moment
with
an
eager
frenzied
eye
but
in
the
next
the
lamp
dropped
from
her
hand
and
she
fell
senseless
at
the
foot
of
the
couch
when
her
senses
returned
she
found
herself
surrounded
by
men
among
whom
was
barnardine
who
were
lifting
her
from
the
floor
and
then
bore
her
along
the
chamber
she
was
sensible
of
what
passed
but
the
extreme
languor
of
her
spirits
did
not
permit
her
to
speak
or
move
or
even
to
feel
any
distinct
fear
they
carried
her
down
the
staircase
by
which
she
had
ascended
when
having
reached
the
arch-way
they
stopped
and
one
of
the
men
taking
the
torch
from
barnardine
opened
a
small
door
that
was
cut
in
the
great
gate
and
as
he
stepped
out
upon
the
road
the
light
he
bore
showed
several
men
on
horseback
in
waiting
whether
it
was
the
freshness
of
the
air
that
revived
emily
or
that
the
objects
she
now
saw
roused
the
spirit
of
alarm
she
suddenly
spoke
and
made
an
ineffectual
effort
to
disengage
herself
from
the
grasp
of
the
ruffians
who
held
her
barnardine
meanwhile
called
loudly
for
the
torch
while
distant
voices
answered
and
several
persons
approached
and
in
the
same
instant
a
light
flashed
upon
the
court
of
the
castle
again
he
vociferated
for
the
torch
and
the
men
hurried
emily
through
the
gate
at
a
short
distance
under
the
shelter
of
the
castle
walls
she
perceived
the
fellow
who
had
taken
the
light
from
the
porter
holding
it
to
a
man
busily
employed
in
altering
the
saddle
of
a
horse
round
which
were
several
horsemen
looking
on
whose
harsh
features
received
the
full
glare
of
the
torch
while
the
broken
ground
beneath
them
the
opposite
walls
with
the
tufted
shrubs
that
overhung
their
summits
and
an
embattled
watch-tower
above
were
reddened
with
the
gleam
which
fading
gradually
away
left
the
remoter
ramparts
and
the
woods
below
to
the
obscurity
of
night
â€œwhat
do
you
waste
time
for
thereâ€
said
barnardine
with
an
oath
as
he
approached
the
horsemen
â€œdispatchâ€”dispatchâ€
â€œthe
saddle
will
be
ready
in
a
minuteâ€
replied
the
man
who
was
buckling
it
at
whom
barnardine
now
swore
again
for
his
negligence
and
emily
calling
feebly
for
help
was
hurried
towards
the
horses
while
the
ruffians
disputed
on
which
to
place
her
the
one
designed
for
her
not
being
ready
at
this
moment
a
cluster
of
lights
issued
from
the
great
gates
and
she
immediately
heard
the
shrill
voice
of
annette
above
those
of
several
other
persons
who
advanced
in
the
same
moment
she
distinguished
montoni
and
cavigni
followed
by
a
number
of
ruffian-faced
fellows
to
whom
she
no
longer
looked
with
terror
but
with
hope
for
at
this
instant
she
did
not
tremble
at
the
thought
of
any
dangers
that
might
await
her
within
the
castle
whence
so
lately
and
so
anxiously
she
had
wished
to
escape
those
which
threatened
her
from
without
had
engrossed
all
her
apprehensions
a
short
contest
ensued
between
the
parties
in
which
that
of
montoni
however
were
presently
victors
and
the
horsemen
perceiving
that
numbers
were
against
them
and
being
perhaps
not
very
warmly
interested
in
the
affair
they
had
undertaken
galloped
off
while
barnardine
had
run
far
enough
to
be
lost
in
the
darkness
and
emily
was
led
back
into
the
castle
as
she
repassed
the
courts
the
remembrance
of
what
she
had
seen
in
the
portal-chamber
came
with
all
its
horror
to
her
mind
and
when
soon
after
she
heard
the
gate
close
that
shut
her
once
more
within
the
castle
walls
she
shuddered
for
herself
and
almost
forgetting
the
danger
she
had
escaped
could
scarcely
think
that
anything
less
precious
than
liberty
and
peace
was
to
be
found
beyond
them
montoni
ordered
emily
to
await
him
in
the
cedar
parlour
whither
he
soon
followed
and
then
sternly
questioned
her
on
this
mysterious
affair
though
she
now
viewed
him
with
horror
as
the
murderer
of
her
aunt
and
scarcely
knew
what
she
said
in
reply
to
his
impatient
enquiries
her
answers
and
her
manner
convinced
him
that
she
had
not
taken
a
voluntary
part
in
the
late
scheme
and
he
dismissed
her
upon
the
appearance
of
his
servants
whom
he
had
ordered
to
attend
that
he
might
enquire
further
into
the
affair
and
discover
those
who
had
been
accomplices
in
it
emily
had
been
some
time
in
her
apartment
before
the
tumult
of
her
mind
allowed
her
to
remember
several
of
the
past
circumstances
then
again
the
dead
form
which
the
curtain
in
the
portal-chamber
had
disclosed
came
to
her
fancy
and
she
uttered
a
groan
which
terrified
annette
the
more
as
emily
forbore
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
on
the
subject
of
it
for
she
feared
to
trust
her
with
so
fatal
a
secret
lest
her
indiscretion
should
call
down
the
immediate
vengeance
of
montoni
on
herself
thus
compelled
to
bear
within
her
own
mind
the
whole
horror
of
the
secret
that
oppressed
it
her
reason
seemed
to
totter
under
the
intolerable
weight
she
often
fixed
a
wild
and
vacant
look
on
annette
and
when
she
spoke
either
did
not
hear
her
or
answered
from
the
purpose
long
fits
of
abstraction
succeeded
annette
spoke
repeatedly
but
her
voice
seemed
not
to
make
any
impression
on
the
sense
of
the
long
agitated
emily
who
sat
fixed
and
silent
except
that
now
and
then
she
heaved
a
heavy
sigh
but
without
tears
terrified
at
her
condition
annette
at
length
left
the
room
to
inform
montoni
of
it
who
had
just
dismissed
his
servants
without
having
made
any
discoveries
on
the
subject
of
his
enquiry
the
wild
description
which
this
girl
now
gave
of
emily
induced
him
to
follow
her
immediately
to
the
chamber
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
emily
turned
her
eyes
and
a
gleam
of
recollection
seemed
to
shoot
athwart
her
mind
for
she
immediately
rose
from
her
seat
and
moved
slowly
to
a
remote
part
of
the
room
he
spoke
to
her
in
accents
somewhat
softened
from
their
usual
harshness
but
she
regarded
him
with
a
kind
of
half
curious
half
terrified
look
and
answered
only
â€œyesâ€
to
whatever
he
said
her
mind
still
seemed
to
retain
no
other
impression
than
that
of
fear
of
this
disorder
annette
could
give
no
explanation
and
montoni
having
attempted
for
some
time
to
persuade
emily
to
talk
retired
after
ordering
annette
to
remain
with
her
during
the
night
and
to
inform
him
in
the
morning
of
her
condition
when
he
was
gone
emily
again
came
forward
and
asked
who
it
was
that
had
been
there
to
disturb
her
annette
said
it
was
the
signorâ€”signor
montoni
emily
repeated
the
name
after
her
several
times
as
if
she
did
not
recollect
it
and
then
suddenly
groaned
and
relapsed
into
abstraction
with
some
difficulty
annette
led
her
to
the
bed
which
emily
examined
with
an
eager
frenzied
eye
before
she
lay
down
and
then
pointing
turned
with
shuddering
emotion
to
annette
who
now
more
terrified
went
towards
the
door
that
she
might
bring
one
of
the
female
servants
to
pass
the
night
with
them
but
emily
observing
her
going
called
her
by
name
and
then
in
the
naturally
soft
and
plaintive
tone
of
her
voice
begged
that
she
too
would
not
forsake
herâ€”â€œfor
since
my
father
diedâ€
added
she
sighing
â€œeverybody
forsakes
meâ€
â€œyour
father
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œhe
was
dead
before
you
knew
meâ€
â€œhe
was
indeedâ€
rejoined
emily
and
her
tears
began
to
flow
she
now
wept
silently
and
long
after
which
becoming
quite
calm
she
at
length
sunk
to
sleep
annette
having
had
discretion
enough
not
to
interrupt
her
tears
this
girl
as
affectionate
as
she
was
simple
lost
in
these
moments
all
her
former
fears
of
remaining
in
the
chamber
and
watched
alone
by
emily
during
the
whole
night
unfold
what
worlds
or
what
vast
regions
hold
thâ€™
immortal
mind
that
hath
forsook
her
mansion
in
this
fleshly
nook
il
penseroso
emilyâ€™s
mind
was
refreshed
by
sleep
on
waking
in
the
morning
she
looked
with
surprise
on
annette
who
sat
sleeping
in
a
chair
beside
the
bed
and
then
endeavoured
to
recollect
herself
but
the
circumstances
of
the
preceding
night
were
swept
from
her
memory
which
seemed
to
retain
no
trace
of
what
had
passed
and
she
was
still
gazing
with
surprise
on
annette
when
the
latter
awoke
â€œo
dear
maâ€™amselle
do
you
know
meâ€
cried
she
â€œknow
you
certainlyâ€
replied
emily
â€œyou
are
annette
but
why
are
you
sitting
by
me
thusâ€
â€œo
you
have
been
very
ill
maâ€™amselleâ€”very
ill
indeed
and
i
am
sure
i
thoughtâ€”â€
â€œthis
is
very
strangeâ€
said
emily
still
trying
to
recollect
the
pastâ€”â€œbut
i
think
i
do
remember
that
my
fancy
has
been
haunted
by
frightful
dreams
good
godâ€
she
added
suddenly
startingâ€”â€œsurely
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
dreamâ€
she
fixed
a
terrified
look
upon
annette
who
intending
to
quiet
her
said
â€œyes
maâ€™amselle
it
was
more
than
a
dream
but
it
is
all
over
nowâ€
â€œshe
is
murdered
thenâ€
said
emily
in
an
inward
voice
and
shuddering
instantaneously
annette
screamed
for
being
ignorant
of
the
circumstance
to
which
emily
referred
she
attributed
her
manner
to
a
disordered
fancy
but
when
she
had
explained
to
what
her
own
speech
alluded
emily
recollecting
the
attempt
that
had
been
made
to
carry
her
off
asked
if
the
contriver
of
it
had
been
discovered
annette
replied
that
he
had
not
though
he
might
easily
be
guessed
at
and
then
told
emily
she
might
thank
her
for
her
deliverance
who
endeavouring
to
command
the
emotion
which
the
remembrance
of
her
aunt
had
occasioned
appeared
calmly
to
listen
to
annette
though
in
truth
she
heard
scarcely
a
word
that
was
said
â€œand
so
maâ€™amselleâ€
continued
the
latter
â€œi
was
determined
to
be
even
with
barnardine
for
refusing
to
tell
me
the
secret
by
finding
it
out
myself
so
i
watched
you
on
the
terrace
and
as
soon
as
he
had
opened
the
door
at
the
end
i
stole
out
from
the
castle
to
try
to
follow
you
for
says
i
i
am
sure
no
good
can
be
planned
or
why
all
this
secrecy
so
sure
enough
he
had
not
bolted
the
door
after
him
and
when
i
opened
it
i
saw
by
the
glimmer
of
the
torch
at
the
other
end
of
the
passage
which
way
you
were
going
i
followed
the
light
at
a
distance
till
you
came
to
the
vaults
of
the
chapel
and
there
i
was
afraid
to
go
further
for
i
had
heard
strange
things
about
these
vaults
but
then
again
i
was
afraid
to
go
back
all
in
darkness
by
myself
so
by
the
time
barnardine
had
trimmed
the
light
i
had
resolved
to
follow
you
and
i
did
so
till
you
came
to
the
great
court
and
there
i
was
afraid
he
would
see
me
so
i
stopped
at
the
door
again
and
watched
you
across
to
the
gates
and
when
you
were
gone
up
the
stairs
i
whipt
after
there
as
i
stood
under
the
gateway
i
heard
horsesâ€™
feet
without
and
several
men
talking
and
i
heard
them
swearing
at
barnardine
for
not
bringing
you
out
and
just
then
he
had
like
to
have
caught
me
for
he
came
down
the
stairs
again
and
i
had
hardly
time
to
get
out
of
his
way
but
i
had
heard
enough
of
his
secret
now
and
i
determined
to
be
even
with
him
and
to
save
you
too
maâ€™amselle
for
i
guessed
it
to
be
some
new
scheme
of
count
morano
though
he
was
gone
away
i
ran
into
the
castle
but
i
had
hard
work
to
find
my
way
through
the
passage
under
the
chapel
and
what
is
very
strange
i
quite
forgot
to
look
for
the
ghosts
they
had
told
me
about
though
i
would
not
go
into
that
place
again
by
myself
for
all
the
world
luckily
the
signor
and
signor
cavigni
were
up
so
we
had
soon
a
train
at
our
heels
sufficient
to
frighten
that
barnardine
and
his
rogues
all
togetherâ€
annette
ceased
to
speak
but
emily
still
appeared
to
listen
at
length
she
said
suddenly
â€œi
think
i
will
go
to
him
myselfâ€”where
is
heâ€
annette
asked
who
was
meant
â€œsignor
montoniâ€
replied
emily
â€œi
would
speak
with
himâ€
and
annette
now
remembering
the
order
he
had
given
on
the
preceding
night
respecting
her
young
lady
rose
and
said
she
would
seek
him
herself
this
honest
girlâ€™s
suspicions
of
count
morano
were
perfectly
just
emily
too
when
she
thought
on
the
scheme
had
attributed
it
to
him
and
montoni
who
had
not
a
doubt
on
this
subject
also
began
to
believe
that
it
was
by
the
direction
of
morano
that
poison
had
formerly
been
mingled
with
his
wine
the
professions
of
repentance
which
morano
had
made
to
emily
under
the
anguish
of
his
wound
was
sincere
at
the
moment
he
offered
them
but
he
had
mistaken
the
subject
of
his
sorrow
for
while
he
thought
he
was
condemning
the
cruelty
of
his
late
design
he
was
lamenting
only
the
state
of
suffering
to
which
it
had
reduced
him
as
these
sufferings
abated
his
former
views
revived
till
his
health
being
re-established
he
again
found
himself
ready
for
enterprise
and
difficulty
the
porter
of
the
castle
who
had
served
him
on
a
former
occasion
willingly
accepted
a
second
bribe
and
having
concerted
the
means
of
drawing
emily
to
the
gates
morano
publicly
left
the
hamlet
whither
he
had
been
carried
after
the
affray
and
withdrew
with
his
people
to
another
at
several
miles
distance
from
thence
on
a
night
agreed
upon
by
barnardine
who
had
discovered
from
the
thoughtless
prattle
of
annette
the
most
probable
means
of
decoying
emily
the
count
sent
back
his
servants
to
the
castle
while
he
awaited
her
arrival
at
the
hamlet
with
an
intention
of
carrying
her
immediately
to
venice
how
this
his
second
scheme
was
frustrated
has
already
appeared
but
the
violent
and
various
passions
with
which
this
italian
lover
was
now
agitated
on
his
return
to
that
city
can
only
be
imagined
annette
having
made
her
report
to
montoni
of
emilyâ€™s
health
and
of
her
request
to
see
him
he
replied
that
she
might
attend
him
in
the
cedar
room
in
about
an
hour
it
was
on
the
subject
that
pressed
so
heavily
on
her
mind
that
emily
wished
to
speak
to
him
yet
she
did
not
distinctly
know
what
good
purpose
this
could
answer
and
sometimes
she
even
recoiled
in
horror
from
the
expectation
of
his
presence
she
wished
also
to
petition
though
she
scarcely
dared
to
believe
the
request
would
be
granted
that
he
would
permit
her
since
her
aunt
was
no
more
to
return
to
her
native
country
as
the
moment
of
interview
approached
her
agitation
increased
so
much
that
she
almost
resolved
to
excuse
herself
under
what
could
scarcely
be
called
a
pretence
of
illness
and
when
she
considered
what
could
be
said
either
concerning
herself
or
the
fate
of
her
aunt
she
was
equally
hopeless
as
to
the
event
of
her
entreaty
and
terrified
as
to
its
effect
upon
the
vengeful
spirit
of
montoni
yet
to
pretend
ignorance
of
her
death
appeared
in
some
degree
to
be
sharing
its
criminality
and
indeed
this
event
was
the
only
ground
on
which
emily
could
rest
her
petition
for
leaving
udolpho
while
her
thoughts
thus
wavered
a
message
was
brought
importing
that
montoni
could
not
see
her
till
the
next
day
and
her
spirits
were
then
relieved
for
a
moment
from
an
almost
intolerable
weight
of
apprehension
annette
said
she
fancied
the
chevaliers
were
going
out
to
the
wars
again
for
the
courtyard
was
filled
with
horses
and
she
heard
that
the
rest
of
the
party
who
went
out
before
were
expected
at
the
castle
â€œand
i
heard
one
of
the
soldiers
tooâ€
added
she
â€œsay
to
his
comrade
that
he
would
warrant
theyâ€™d
bring
home
a
rare
deal
of
bootyâ€”so
thinks
i
if
the
signor
can
with
a
safe
conscience
send
his
people
out
a-robbingâ€”why
it
is
no
business
of
mine
i
only
wish
i
was
once
safe
out
of
this
castle
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
poor
ludovicoâ€™s
sake
i
would
have
let
count
moranoâ€™s
people
run
away
with
us
both
for
it
would
have
been
serving
you
a
good
turn
maâ€™amselle
as
well
as
myselfâ€
annette
might
have
continued
thus
talking
for
hours
for
any
interruption
she
would
have
received
from
emily
who
was
silent
inattentive
absorbed
in
thought
and
passed
the
whole
of
this
day
in
a
kind
of
solemn
tranquillity
such
as
is
often
the
result
of
faculties
overstrained
by
suffering
when
night
returned
emily
recollected
the
mysterious
strains
of
music
that
she
had
lately
heard
in
which
she
still
felt
some
degree
of
interest
and
of
which
she
hoped
to
hear
again
the
soothing
sweetness
the
influence
of
superstition
now
gained
on
the
weakness
of
her
long-harassed
mind
she
looked
with
enthusiastic
expectation
to
the
guardian
spirit
of
her
father
and
having
dismissed
annette
for
the
night
determined
to
watch
alone
for
their
return
it
was
not
yet
however
near
the
time
when
she
had
heard
the
music
on
a
former
night
and
anxious
to
call
off
her
thoughts
from
distressing
subjects
she
sat
down
with
one
of
the
few
books
that
she
had
brought
from
france
but
her
mind
refusing
control
became
restless
and
agitated
and
she
went
often
to
the
casement
to
listen
for
a
sound
once
she
thought
she
heard
a
voice
but
then
everything
without
the
casement
remaining
still
she
concluded
that
her
fancy
had
deceived
her
thus
passed
the
time
till
twelve
oâ€™clock
soon
after
which
the
distant
sounds
that
murmured
through
the
castle
ceased
and
sleep
seemed
to
reign
over
all
emily
then
seated
herself
at
the
casement
where
she
was
soon
recalled
from
the
reverie
into
which
she
sunk
by
very
unusual
sounds
not
of
music
but
like
the
low
mourning
of
some
person
in
distress
as
she
listened
her
heart
faltered
in
terror
and
she
became
convinced
that
the
former
sound
was
more
than
imaginary
still
at
intervals
she
heard
a
kind
of
feeble
lamentation
and
sought
to
discover
whence
it
came
there
were
several
rooms
underneath
adjoining
the
rampart
which
had
been
long
shut
up
and
as
the
sound
probably
rose
from
one
of
these
she
leaned
from
the
casement
to
observe
whether
any
light
was
visible
there
the
chambers
as
far
as
she
could
perceive
were
quite
dark
but
at
a
little
distance
on
the
rampart
below
she
thought
she
saw
something
moving
the
faint
twilight
which
the
stars
shed
did
not
enable
her
to
distinguish
what
it
was
but
she
judged
it
to
be
a
sentinel
on
watch
and
she
removed
her
light
to
a
remote
part
of
the
chamber
that
she
might
escape
notice
during
her
further
observation
the
same
object
still
appeared
presently
it
advanced
along
the
rampart
towards
her
window
and
she
then
distinguished
something
like
a
human
form
but
the
silence
with
which
it
moved
convinced
her
it
was
no
sentinel
as
it
drew
near
she
hesitated
whether
to
retire
a
thrilling
curiosity
inclined
her
to
stay
but
a
dread
of
she
scarcely
knew
what
warned
her
to
withdraw
while
she
paused
the
figure
came
opposite
to
her
casement
and
was
stationary
everything
remained
quiet
she
had
not
heard
even
a
foot-fall
and
the
solemnity
of
this
silence
with
the
mysterious
form
she
saw
subdued
her
spirits
so
that
she
was
moving
from
the
casement
when
on
a
sudden
she
observed
the
figure
start
away
and
glide
down
the
rampart
after
which
it
was
soon
lost
in
the
obscurity
of
night
emily
continued
to
gaze
for
some
time
on
the
way
it
had
passed
and
then
retired
within
her
chamber
musing
on
this
strange
circumstance
and
scarcely
doubting
that
she
had
witnessed
a
supernatural
appearance
when
her
spirits
recovered
composure
she
looked
round
for
some
other
explanation
remembering
what
she
had
heard
of
the
daring
enterprises
of
montoni
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
just
seen
some
unhappy
person
who
having
been
plundered
by
his
banditti
was
brought
hither
a
captive
and
that
the
music
she
had
formerly
heard
came
from
him
yet
if
they
had
plundered
him
it
still
appeared
improbable
that
they
should
have
brought
him
to
the
castle
and
it
was
also
more
consistent
with
the
manners
of
banditti
to
murder
those
they
rob
than
to
make
them
prisoners
but
what
more
than
any
other
circumstance
contradicted
the
supposition
that
it
was
a
prisoner
was
that
it
wandered
on
the
terrace
without
a
guard
a
consideration
which
made
her
dismiss
immediately
her
first
surmise
afterwards
she
was
inclined
to
believe
that
count
morano
had
obtained
admittance
into
the
castle
but
she
soon
recollected
the
difficulties
and
dangers
that
must
have
opposed
such
an
enterprise
and
that
if
he
had
so
far
succeeded
to
come
alone
and
in
silence
to
her
casement
at
midnight
was
not
the
conduct
he
would
have
adopted
particularly
since
the
private
staircase
communicating
with
her
apartment
was
known
to
him
neither
would
he
have
uttered
the
dismal
sounds
she
had
heard
another
suggestion
represented
that
this
might
be
some
person
who
had
designs
upon
the
castle
but
the
mournful
sounds
destroyed
also
that
probability
thus
enquiry
only
perplexed
her
who
or
what
it
could
be
that
haunted
this
lonely
hour
complaining
in
such
doleful
accents
and
in
such
sweet
music
for
she
was
still
inclined
to
believe
that
the
former
strains
and
the
late
appearance
were
connected
she
had
no
means
of
ascertaining
and
imagination
again
assumed
her
empire
and
roused
the
mysteries
of
superstition
she
determined
however
to
watch
on
the
following
night
when
her
doubts
might
perhaps
be
cleared
up
and
she
almost
resolved
to
address
the
figure
if
it
should
appear
again
such
are
those
thick
and
gloomy
shadows
damp
oft
seen
in
charnel-vaults
and
sepulchres
lingering
and
sitting
by
a
new-made
grave
milton
on
the
following
day
montoni
sent
a
second
excuse
to
emily
who
was
surprised
at
the
circumstance
â€œthis
is
very
strangeâ€
said
she
to
herself
â€œhis
conscience
tells
him
the
purport
of
my
visit
and
he
defers
it
to
avoid
an
explanationâ€
she
now
almost
resolved
to
throw
herself
in
his
way
but
terror
checked
the
intention
and
this
day
passed
as
the
preceding
one
with
emily
except
that
a
degree
of
awful
expectation
concerning
the
approaching
night
now
somewhat
disturbed
the
dreadful
calmness
that
had
pervaded
her
mind
towards
evening
the
second
part
of
the
band
which
had
made
the
first
excursion
among
the
mountains
returned
to
the
castle
where
as
they
entered
the
courts
emily
in
her
remote
chamber
heard
their
loud
shouts
and
strains
of
exultation
like
the
orgies
of
furies
over
some
horrid
sacrifice
she
even
feared
they
were
about
to
commit
some
barbarous
deed
a
conjecture
from
which
however
annette
soon
relieved
her
by
telling
that
the
people
were
only
exulting
over
the
plunder
they
had
brought
with
them
this
circumstance
still
further
confirmed
her
in
the
belief
that
montoni
had
really
commenced
to
be
a
captain
of
banditti
and
meant
to
retrieve
his
broken
fortunes
by
the
plunder
of
travellers
indeed
when
she
considered
all
the
circumstances
of
his
situationâ€”in
an
armed
and
almost
inaccessible
castle
retired
far
among
the
recesses
of
wild
and
solitary
mountains
along
whose
distant
skirts
were
scattered
towns
and
cities
whither
wealthy
travellers
were
continually
passingâ€”this
appeared
to
be
the
situation
of
all
others
most
suited
for
the
success
of
schemes
of
rapine
and
she
yielded
to
the
strange
thought
that
montoni
was
become
a
captain
of
robbers
his
character
also
unprincipled
dauntless
cruel
and
enterprising
seemed
to
fit
him
for
the
situation
delighting
in
the
tumult
and
in
the
struggles
of
life
he
was
equally
a
stranger
to
pity
and
to
fear
his
very
courage
was
a
sort
of
animal
ferocity
not
the
noble
impulse
of
a
principle
such
as
inspirits
the
mind
against
the
oppressor
in
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
but
a
constitutional
hardiness
of
nerve
that
cannot
feel
and
that
therefore
cannot
fear
emilyâ€™s
supposition
however
natural
was
in
part
erroneous
for
she
was
a
stranger
to
the
state
of
this
country
and
to
the
circumstances
under
which
its
frequent
wars
were
partly
conducted
the
revenues
of
the
many
states
of
italy
being
at
that
time
insufficient
to
the
support
of
standing
armies
even
during
the
short
periods
which
the
turbulent
habits
both
of
the
governments
and
the
people
permitted
to
pass
in
peace
an
order
of
men
arose
not
known
in
our
age
and
but
faintly
described
in
the
history
of
their
own
of
the
soldiers
disbanded
at
the
end
of
every
war
few
returned
to
the
safe
but
unprofitable
occupations
then
usual
in
peace
sometimes
they
passed
into
other
countries
and
mingled
with
armies
which
still
kept
the
field
sometimes
they
formed
themselves
into
bands
of
robbers
and
occupied
remote
fortresses
where
their
desperate
character
the
weakness
of
the
governments
which
they
offended
and
the
certainty
that
they
could
be
recalled
to
the
armies
when
their
presence
should
be
again
wanted
prevented
them
from
being
much
pursued
by
the
civil
power
and
sometimes
they
attached
themselves
to
the
fortunes
of
a
popular
chief
by
whom
they
were
led
into
the
service
of
any
state
which
could
settle
with
him
the
price
of
their
valour
from
this
latter
practice
arose
their
nameâ€”condottieri
a
term
formidable
all
over
italy
for
a
period
which
concluded
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
but
of
which
it
is
not
so
easy
to
ascertain
the
commencement
contests
between
the
smaller
states
were
then
for
the
most
part
affairs
of
enterprise
alone
and
the
probabilities
of
success
were
estimated
not
from
the
skill
but
from
the
personal
courage
of
the
general
and
the
soldiers
the
ability
which
was
necessary
to
the
conduct
of
tedious
operations
was
little
valued
it
was
enough
to
know
how
a
party
might
be
led
towards
their
enemies
with
the
greatest
secrecy
or
conducted
from
them
in
the
compactest
order
the
officer
was
to
precipitate
himself
into
a
situation
where
but
for
his
example
the
soldiers
might
not
have
ventured
and
as
the
opposed
parties
knew
little
of
each
otherâ€™s
strength
the
event
of
the
day
was
frequently
determined
by
the
boldness
of
the
first
movements
in
such
services
the
condottieri
were
eminent
and
in
these
where
plunder
always
followed
success
their
characters
acquired
a
mixture
of
intrepidity
and
profligacy
which
awed
even
those
whom
they
served
when
they
were
not
thus
engaged
their
chief
had
usually
his
own
fortress
in
which
or
in
its
neighbourhood
they
enjoyed
an
irksome
rest
and
though
their
wants
were
at
one
time
partly
supplied
from
the
property
of
the
inhabitants
the
lavish
distribution
of
their
plunder
at
others
prevented
them
from
being
obnoxious
and
the
peasants
of
such
districts
gradually
shared
the
character
of
their
warlike
visitors
the
neighbouring
governments
sometimes
professed
but
seldom
endeavoured
to
suppress
these
military
communities
both
because
it
was
difficult
to
do
so
and
because
a
disguised
protection
of
them
ensured
for
the
service
of
their
wars
a
body
of
men
who
could
not
otherwise
be
so
cheaply
maintained
or
so
perfectly
qualified
the
commanders
sometimes
even
relied
so
far
upon
this
policy
of
the
several
powers
as
to
frequent
their
capitals
and
montoni
having
met
them
in
the
gaming
parties
of
venice
and
padua
conceived
a
desire
to
emulate
their
characters
before
his
ruined
fortunes
tempted
him
to
adopt
their
practices
it
was
for
the
arrangement
of
his
present
plan
of
life
that
the
midnight
councils
were
held
at
his
mansion
in
venice
and
at
which
orsino
and
some
other
members
of
the
present
community
then
assisted
with
suggestions
which
they
had
since
executed
with
the
wreck
of
their
fortunes
on
the
return
of
night
emily
resumed
her
station
at
the
casement
there
was
now
a
moon
and
as
it
rose
over
the
tufted
woods
its
yellow
light
served
to
show
the
lonely
terrace
and
the
surrounding
objects
more
distinctly
than
the
twilight
of
the
stars
had
done
and
promised
emily
to
assist
her
observations
should
the
mysterious
form
return
on
this
subject
she
again
wavered
in
conjecture
and
hesitated
whether
to
speak
to
the
figure
to
which
a
strong
and
almost
irresistible
interest
urged
her
but
terror
at
intervals
made
her
reluctant
to
do
so
â€œif
this
is
a
person
who
has
designs
upon
the
castleâ€
said
she
â€œmy
curiosity
may
prove
fatal
to
me
yet
the
mysterious
music
and
the
lamentations
i
heard
must
surely
have
proceeded
from
him
if
so
he
cannot
be
an
enemyâ€
she
then
thought
of
her
unfortunate
aunt
and
shuddering
with
grief
and
horror
the
suggestions
of
imagination
seized
her
mind
with
all
the
force
of
truth
and
she
believed
that
the
form
she
had
seen
was
supernatural
she
trembled
breathed
with
difficulty
an
icy
coldness
touched
her
cheeks
and
her
fears
for
a
while
overcame
her
judgment
her
resolution
now
forsook
her
and
she
determined
if
the
figure
should
appear
not
to
speak
to
it
thus
the
time
passed
as
she
sat
at
her
casement
awed
by
expectation
and
by
the
gloom
and
stillness
of
midnight
for
she
saw
obscurely
in
the
moonlight
only
the
mountains
and
woods
a
cluster
of
towers
that
formed
the
west
angle
of
the
castle
and
the
terrace
below
and
heard
no
sound
except
now
and
then
the
lonely
watch-word
passed
by
the
sentinels
on
duty
and
afterwards
the
steps
of
the
men
who
came
to
relieve
guard
and
whom
she
knew
at
a
distance
on
the
rampart
by
their
pikes
that
glittered
in
the
moonbeam
and
then
by
the
few
short
words
in
which
they
hailed
their
fellows
of
the
night
emily
retired
within
her
chamber
while
they
passed
the
casement
when
she
returned
to
it
all
was
again
quiet
it
was
now
very
late
she
was
wearied
with
watching
and
began
to
doubt
the
reality
of
what
she
had
seen
on
the
preceding
night
but
she
still
lingered
at
the
window
for
her
mind
was
too
perturbed
to
admit
of
sleep
the
moon
shone
with
a
clear
lustre
that
afforded
her
a
complete
view
of
the
terrace
but
she
saw
only
a
solitary
sentinel
pacing
at
one
end
of
it
and
at
length
tired
with
expectation
she
withdrew
to
seek
rest
such
however
was
the
impression
left
on
her
mind
by
the
music
and
the
complaining
she
had
formerly
heard
as
well
as
by
the
figure
which
she
fancied
she
had
seen
that
she
determined
to
repeat
the
watch
on
the
following
night
montoni
on
the
next
day
took
no
notice
of
emilyâ€™s
appointed
visit
but
she
more
anxious
than
before
to
see
him
sent
annette
to
enquire
at
what
hour
he
would
admit
her
he
mentioned
eleven
oâ€™clock
and
emily
was
punctual
to
the
moment
at
which
she
called
up
all
her
fortitude
to
support
the
shock
of
his
presence
and
the
dreadful
recollections
it
enforced
he
was
with
several
of
his
officers
in
the
cedar
room
on
observing
whom
she
paused
and
her
agitation
increased
while
he
continued
to
converse
with
them
apparently
not
observing
her
till
some
of
his
officers
turning
round
saw
emily
and
uttered
an
exclamation
she
was
hastily
retiring
when
montoniâ€™s
voice
arrested
her
and
in
a
faultering
accent
she
saidâ€”â€œi
would
speak
with
you
signor
montoni
if
you
are
at
leisureâ€
â€œthese
are
my
friendsâ€
he
replied
â€œwhatever
you
would
say
they
may
hearâ€
emily
without
replying
turned
from
the
rude
gaze
of
the
chevaliers
and
montoni
then
followed
her
to
the
hall
whence
he
led
her
to
a
small
room
of
which
he
shut
the
door
with
violence
as
she
looked
on
his
dark
countenance
she
again
thought
she
saw
the
murderer
of
her
aunt
and
her
mind
was
so
convulsed
with
horror
that
she
had
not
power
to
recall
thought
enough
to
explain
the
purport
of
her
visit
and
to
trust
herself
with
the
mention
of
madame
montoni
was
more
than
she
dared
montoni
at
length
impatiently
enquired
what
she
had
to
say
â€œi
have
no
time
for
triflingâ€
he
added
â€œmy
moments
are
importantâ€
emily
then
told
him
that
she
wished
to
return
to
france
and
came
to
beg
that
he
would
permit
her
to
do
soâ€”but
when
he
looked
surprised
and
enquired
for
the
motive
of
the
request
she
hesitated
became
paler
than
before
trembled
and
had
nearly
sunk
at
his
feet
he
observed
her
emotion
with
apparent
indifference
and
interrupted
the
silence
by
telling
her
he
must
be
gone
emily
however
recalled
her
spirits
sufficiently
to
enable
her
to
repeat
her
request
and
when
montoni
absolutely
refused
it
her
slumbering
mind
was
roused
â€œi
can
no
longer
remain
here
with
propriety
sirâ€
said
she
â€œand
i
may
be
allowed
to
ask
by
what
right
you
detain
meâ€
â€œit
is
my
will
that
you
remain
hereâ€
said
montoni
laying
his
hand
on
the
door
to
go
â€œlet
that
suffice
youâ€
emily
considering
that
she
had
no
appeal
from
this
will
forbore
to
dispute
his
right
and
made
a
feeble
effort
to
persuade
him
to
be
just
â€œwhile
my
aunt
lived
sirâ€
said
she
in
a
tremulous
voice
â€œmy
residence
here
was
not
improper
but
now
that
she
is
no
more
i
may
surely
be
permitted
to
depart
my
stay
cannot
benefit
you
sir
and
will
only
distress
meâ€
â€œwho
told
you
that
madame
montoni
was
deadâ€
said
montoni
with
an
inquisitive
eye
emily
hesitated
for
nobody
had
told
her
so
and
she
did
not
dare
to
avow
the
having
seen
that
spectacle
in
the
portal-chamber
which
had
compelled
her
to
the
belief
â€œwho
told
you
soâ€
he
repeated
more
sternly
â€œalas
i
know
it
too
wellâ€
replied
emily
â€œspare
me
on
this
terrible
subjectâ€
she
sat
down
on
a
bench
to
support
herself
â€œif
you
wish
to
see
herâ€
said
montoni
â€œyou
may
she
lies
in
the
east
turretâ€
he
now
left
the
room
without
awaiting
her
reply
and
returned
to
the
cedar
chamber
where
such
of
the
chevaliers
as
had
not
before
seen
emily
began
to
rally
him
on
the
discovery
they
had
made
but
montoni
did
not
appear
disposed
to
bear
this
mirth
and
they
changed
the
subject
having
talked
with
the
subtle
orsino
on
the
plan
of
an
excursion
which
he
meditated
for
a
future
day
his
friend
advised
that
they
should
lie
in
wait
for
the
enemy
which
verezzi
impetuously
opposed
reproached
orsino
with
want
of
spirit
and
swore
that
if
montoni
would
let
him
lead
on
fifty
men
he
would
conquer
all
that
should
oppose
him
orsino
smiled
contemptuously
montoni
smiled
too
but
he
also
listened
verezzi
then
proceeded
with
vehement
declamation
and
assertion
till
he
was
stopped
by
an
argument
of
orsino
which
he
knew
not
how
to
answer
better
than
by
invective
his
fierce
spirit
detested
the
cunning
caution
of
orsino
whom
he
constantly
opposed
and
whose
inveterate
though
silent
hatred
he
had
long
ago
incurred
and
montoni
was
a
calm
observer
of
both
whose
different
qualifications
he
knew
and
how
to
bend
their
opposite
character
to
the
perfection
of
his
own
designs
but
verezzi
in
the
heat
of
opposition
now
did
not
scruple
to
accuse
orsino
of
cowardice
at
which
the
countenance
of
the
latter
while
he
made
no
reply
was
overspread
with
a
livid
paleness
and
montoni
who
watched
his
lurking
eye
saw
him
put
his
hand
hastily
into
his
bosom
but
verezzi
whose
face
glowing
with
crimson
formed
a
striking
contrast
to
the
complexion
of
orsino
remarked
not
the
action
and
continued
boldly
declaiming
against
cowards
to
cavigni
who
was
slily
laughing
at
his
vehemence
and
at
the
silent
mortification
of
orsino
when
the
latter
retiring
a
few
steps
behind
drew
forth
a
stilletto
to
stab
his
adversary
in
the
back
montoni
arrested
his
half-extended
arm
and
with
a
significant
look
made
him
return
the
poniard
into
his
bosom
unseen
by
all
except
himself
for
most
of
the
party
were
disputing
at
a
distant
window
on
the
situation
of
a
dell
where
they
meant
to
form
an
ambuscade
when
verezzi
had
turned
round
the
deadly
hatred
expressed
on
the
features
of
his
opponent
raising
for
the
first
time
a
suspicion
of
his
intention
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
sword
and
then
seeming
to
recollect
himself
strode
up
to
montoni
â€œsignorâ€
said
he
with
a
significant
look
at
orsino
â€œwe
are
not
a
band
of
assassins
if
you
have
business
for
brave
men
employ
me
on
this
expedition
you
shall
have
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
if
you
have
only
work
for
cowardsâ€”keep
himâ€
pointing
to
orsino
â€œand
let
me
quit
udolphoâ€
orsino
still
more
incensed
again
drew
forth
his
stilletto
and
rushed
towards
verezzi
who
at
the
same
instant
advanced
with
his
sword
when
montoni
and
the
rest
of
the
party
interfered
and
separated
them
â€œthis
is
the
conduct
of
a
boyâ€
said
montoni
to
verezzi
â€œnot
of
a
man
be
more
moderate
in
your
speechâ€
â€œmoderation
is
the
virtue
of
cowardsâ€
retorted
verezzi
â€œthey
are
moderate
in
everythingâ€”but
in
fearâ€
â€œi
accept
your
wordsâ€
said
montoni
turning
upon
him
with
a
fierce
and
haughty
look
and
drawing
his
sword
out
of
the
scabbard
â€œwith
all
my
heartâ€
cried
verezzi
â€œthough
i
did
not
mean
them
for
youâ€
he
directed
a
pass
at
montoni
and
while
they
fought
the
villain
orsino
made
another
attempt
to
stab
verezzi
and
was
again
prevented
the
combatants
were
at
length
separated
and
after
a
very
long
and
violent
dispute
reconciled
montoni
then
left
the
room
with
orsino
whom
he
detained
in
private
consultation
for
a
considerable
time
emily
meanwhile
stunned
by
the
last
words
of
montoni
forgot
for
the
moment
his
declaration
that
she
should
continue
in
the
castle
while
she
thought
of
her
unfortunate
aunt
who
he
had
said
was
laid
in
the
east
turret
in
suffering
the
remains
of
his
wife
to
lie
thus
long
unburied
there
appeared
a
degree
of
brutality
more
shocking
than
she
had
suspected
even
montoni
could
practise
after
a
long
struggle
she
determined
to
accept
his
permission
to
visit
the
turret
and
to
take
a
last
look
of
her
ill-fated
aunt
with
which
design
she
returned
to
her
chamber
and
while
she
waited
for
annette
to
accompany
her
endeavoured
to
acquire
fortitude
sufficient
to
support
her
through
the
approaching
scene
for
though
she
trembled
to
encounter
it
she
knew
that
to
remember
the
performance
of
this
last
act
of
duty
would
hereafter
afford
her
consoling
satisfaction
annette
came
and
emily
mentioned
her
purpose
from
which
the
former
endeavoured
to
dissuade
her
though
without
effect
and
annette
was
with
much
difficulty
prevailed
upon
to
accompany
her
to
the
turret
but
no
consideration
could
make
her
promise
to
enter
the
chamber
of
death
they
now
left
the
corridor
and
having
reached
the
foot
of
the
staircase
which
emily
had
formerly
ascended
annette
declared
she
would
go
no
further
and
emily
proceeded
alone
when
she
saw
the
track
of
blood
which
she
had
before
observed
her
spirits
fainted
and
being
compelled
to
rest
on
the
stairs
she
almost
determined
to
proceed
no
further
the
pause
of
a
few
moments
restored
her
resolution
and
she
went
on
as
she
drew
near
the
landing-place
upon
which
the
upper
chamber
opened
she
remembered
that
the
door
was
formerly
fastened
and
apprehended
that
it
might
still
be
so
in
this
expectation
however
she
was
mistaken
for
the
door
opened
at
once
into
a
dusky
and
silent
chamber
round
which
she
fearfully
looked
and
then
slowly
advanced
when
a
hollow
voice
spoke
emily
who
was
unable
to
speak
or
to
move
from
the
spot
uttered
no
sound
of
terror
the
voice
spoke
again
and
then
thinking
that
it
resembled
that
of
madame
montoni
emilyâ€™s
spirits
were
instantly
roused
she
rushed
towards
a
bed
that
stood
in
a
remote
part
of
the
room
and
drew
aside
the
curtains
within
appeared
a
pale
and
emaciated
face
she
started
back
then
again
advanced
shuddered
as
she
took
up
the
skeleton
hand
that
lay
stretched
upon
the
quilt
then
let
it
drop
and
then
viewed
the
face
with
a
long
unsettled
gaze
it
was
that
of
madame
montoni
though
so
changed
by
illness
that
the
resemblance
of
what
it
had
been
could
scarcely
be
traced
in
what
it
now
appeared
she
was
still
alive
and
raising
her
heavy
eyes
she
turned
them
on
her
niece
â€œwhere
have
you
been
so
longâ€
said
she
in
the
same
tone
â€œi
thought
you
had
forsaken
meâ€
â€œdo
you
indeed
liveâ€
said
emily
at
length
â€œor
is
this
but
a
terrible
apparitionâ€
she
received
no
answer
and
again
she
snatched
up
the
hand
â€œthis
is
substanceâ€
she
exclaimed
â€œbut
it
is
coldâ€”cold
as
marbleâ€
she
let
it
fall
â€œo
if
you
really
live
speakâ€
said
emily
in
a
voice
of
desperation
â€œthat
i
may
not
lose
my
sensesâ€”say
you
know
meâ€
â€œi
do
liveâ€
replied
madame
montoni
â€œbutâ€”i
feel
that
i
am
about
to
dieâ€
emily
clasped
the
hand
she
held
more
eagerly
and
groaned
they
were
both
silent
for
some
moments
then
emily
endeavoured
to
soothe
her
and
enquired
what
had
reduced
her
to
this
present
deplorable
state
montoni
when
he
removed
her
to
the
turret
under
the
improbable
suspicion
of
having
attempted
his
life
had
ordered
the
men
employed
on
the
occasion
to
observe
a
strict
secrecy
concerning
her
to
this
he
was
influenced
by
a
double
motive
he
meant
to
debar
her
from
the
comfort
of
emilyâ€™s
visits
and
to
secure
an
opportunity
of
privately
dispatching
her
should
any
new
circumstances
occur
to
confirm
the
present
suggestions
of
his
suspecting
mind
his
consciousness
of
the
hatred
he
deserved
it
was
natural
enough
should
at
first
lead
him
to
attribute
to
her
the
attempt
that
had
been
made
upon
his
life
and
though
there
was
no
other
reason
to
believe
that
she
was
concerned
in
that
atrocious
design
his
suspicions
remained
he
continued
to
confine
her
in
the
turret
under
a
strict
guard
and
without
pity
or
remorse
had
suffered
her
to
lie
forlorn
and
neglected
under
a
raging
fever
till
it
had
reduced
her
to
the
present
state
the
track
of
blood
which
emily
had
seen
on
the
stairs
had
flowed
from
the
unbound
wound
of
one
of
the
men
employed
to
carry
madame
montoni
and
which
he
had
received
in
the
late
affray
at
night
these
men
having
contented
themselves
with
securing
the
door
of
their
prisonerâ€™s
room
had
retired
from
guard
and
then
it
was
that
emily
at
the
time
of
her
first
enquiry
had
found
the
turret
so
silent
and
deserted
when
she
had
attempted
to
open
the
door
of
the
chamber
her
aunt
was
sleeping
and
this
occasioned
the
silence
which
had
contributed
to
delude
her
into
a
belief
that
she
was
no
more
yet
had
her
terror
permitted
her
to
persevere
longer
in
the
call
she
would
probably
have
awakened
madame
montoni
and
have
been
spared
much
suffering
the
spectacle
in
the
portal-chamber
which
afterwards
confirmed
emilyâ€™s
horrible
suspicion
was
the
corpse
of
a
man
who
had
fallen
in
the
affray
and
the
same
which
had
been
borne
into
the
servantsâ€™
hall
where
she
took
refuge
from
the
tumult
this
man
had
lingered
under
his
wounds
for
some
days
and
soon
after
his
death
his
body
had
been
removed
on
the
couch
on
which
he
died
for
interment
in
the
vault
beneath
the
chapel
through
which
emily
and
barnardine
had
passed
to
the
chamber
emily
after
asking
madame
montoni
a
thousand
questions
concerning
herself
left
her
and
sought
montoni
for
the
more
solemn
interest
she
felt
for
her
aunt
made
her
now
regardless
of
the
resentment
her
remonstrances
might
draw
upon
herself
and
of
the
improbability
of
his
granting
what
she
meant
to
entreat
â€œmadame
montoni
is
now
dying
sirâ€
said
emily
as
soon
as
she
saw
himâ€”â€œyour
resentment
surely
will
not
pursue
her
to
the
last
moment
suffer
her
to
be
removed
from
that
forlorn
room
to
her
own
apartment
and
to
have
necessary
comforts
administeredâ€
â€œof
what
service
will
that
be
if
she
is
dyingâ€
said
montoni
with
apparent
indifference
â€œthe
service
at
leave
of
saving
you
sir
from
a
few
of
those
pangs
of
conscience
you
must
suffer
when
you
shall
be
in
the
same
situationâ€
said
emily
with
imprudent
indignation
of
which
montoni
soon
made
her
sensible
by
commanding
her
to
quit
his
presence
then
forgetting
her
resentment
and
impressed
only
by
compassion
for
the
piteous
state
of
her
aunt
dying
without
succour
she
submitted
to
humble
herself
to
montoni
and
to
adopt
every
persuasive
means
that
might
induce
him
to
relent
towards
his
wife
for
a
considerable
time
he
was
proof
against
all
she
said
and
all
she
looked
but
at
length
the
divinity
of
pity
beaming
in
emilyâ€™s
eyes
seemed
to
touch
his
heart
he
turned
away
ashamed
of
his
better
feelings
half
sullen
and
half
relenting
but
finally
consented
that
his
wife
should
be
removed
to
her
own
apartment
and
that
emily
should
attend
her
dreading
equally
that
this
relief
might
arrive
too
late
and
that
montoni
might
retract
his
concession
emily
scarcely
staid
to
thank
him
for
it
but
assisted
by
annette
she
quickly
prepared
madame
montoniâ€™s
bed
and
they
carried
her
a
cordial
that
might
enable
her
feeble
frame
to
sustain
the
fatigue
of
a
removal
madame
was
scarcely
arrived
in
her
own
apartment
when
an
order
was
given
by
her
husband
that
she
should
remain
in
the
turret
but
emily
thankful
that
she
had
made
such
dispatch
hastened
to
inform
him
of
it
as
well
as
that
a
second
removal
would
instantly
prove
fatal
and
he
suffered
his
wife
to
continue
where
she
was
during
this
day
emily
never
left
madame
montoni
except
to
prepare
such
little
nourishing
things
as
she
judged
necessary
to
sustain
her
and
which
madame
montoni
received
with
quiet
acquiescence
though
she
seemed
sensible
that
they
could
not
save
her
from
approaching
dissolution
and
scarcely
appeared
to
wish
for
life
emily
meanwhile
watched
over
her
with
the
most
tender
solicitude
no
longer
seeing
her
imperious
aunt
in
the
poor
object
before
her
but
the
sister
of
her
late
beloved
father
in
a
situation
that
called
for
all
her
compassion
and
kindness
when
night
came
she
determined
to
sit
up
with
her
aunt
but
this
the
latter
positively
forbade
commanding
her
to
retire
to
rest
and
annette
alone
to
remain
in
her
chamber
rest
was
indeed
necessary
to
emily
whose
spirits
and
frame
were
equally
wearied
by
the
occurrences
and
exertions
of
the
day
but
she
would
not
leave
madame
montoni
till
after
the
turn
of
midnight
a
period
then
thought
so
critical
by
the
physicians
soon
after
twelve
having
enjoined
annette
to
be
wakeful
and
to
call
her
should
any
change
appear
for
the
worse
emily
sorrowfully
bade
madame
montoni
good
night
and
withdrew
to
her
chamber
her
spirits
were
more
than
usually
depressed
by
the
piteous
condition
of
her
aunt
whose
recovery
she
scarcely
dared
to
expect
to
her
own
misfortunes
she
saw
no
period
inclosed
as
she
was
in
a
remote
castle
beyond
the
reach
of
any
friends
had
she
possessed
such
and
beyond
the
pity
even
of
strangers
while
she
knew
herself
to
be
in
the
power
of
a
man
capable
of
any
action
which
his
interest
or
his
ambition
might
suggest
occupied
by
melancholy
reflections
and
by
anticipations
as
sad
she
did
not
retire
immediately
to
rest
but
leaned
thoughtfully
on
her
open
casement
the
scene
before
her
of
woods
and
mountains
reposing
in
the
moonlight
formed
a
regretted
contrast
with
the
state
of
her
mind
but
the
lonely
murmur
of
these
woods
and
the
view
of
this
sleeping
landscape
gradually
soothed
her
emotions
and
softened
her
to
tears
she
continued
to
weep
for
some
time
lost
to
everything
but
to
a
gentle
sense
of
her
misfortunes
when
she
at
length
took
the
handkerchief
from
her
eyes
she
perceived
before
her
on
the
terrace
below
the
figure
she
had
formerly
observed
which
stood
fixed
and
silent
immediately
opposite
to
her
casement
on
perceiving
it
she
started
back
and
terror
for
some
time
overcame
curiosityâ€”at
length
she
returned
to
the
casement
and
still
the
figure
was
before
it
which
she
now
compelled
herself
to
observe
but
was
utterly
unable
to
speak
as
she
had
formerly
intended
the
moon
shone
with
a
clear
light
and
it
was
perhaps
the
agitation
of
her
mind
that
prevented
her
distinguishing
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
the
form
before
her
it
was
still
stationary
and
she
began
to
doubt
whether
it
was
really
animated
her
scattered
thoughts
were
now
so
far
returned
as
to
remind
her
that
her
light
exposed
her
to
dangerous
observation
and
she
was
stepping
back
to
remove
it
when
she
perceived
the
figure
move
and
then
wave
what
seemed
to
be
its
arm
as
if
to
beckon
her
and
while
she
gazed
fixed
in
fear
it
repeated
the
action
she
now
attempted
to
speak
but
the
words
died
on
her
lips
and
she
went
from
the
casement
to
remove
her
light
as
she
was
doing
which
she
heard
from
without
a
faint
groan
listening
but
not
daring
to
return
she
presently
heard
it
repeated
â€œgood
godâ€”what
can
this
meanâ€
said
she
again
she
listened
but
the
sound
came
no
more
and
after
a
long
interval
of
silence
she
recovered
courage
enough
to
go
to
the
casement
when
she
again
saw
the
same
appearance
it
beckoned
again
and
again
uttered
a
low
sound
â€œthat
groan
was
surely
humanâ€
said
she
â€œi
will
speakâ€
â€œwho
is
itâ€
cried
emily
in
a
faint
voice
â€œthat
wanders
at
this
late
hourâ€
the
figure
raised
its
head
but
suddenly
started
away
and
glided
down
the
terrace
she
watched
it
for
a
long
while
passing
swiftly
in
the
moonlight
but
heard
no
footstep
till
a
sentinel
from
the
other
extremity
of
the
rampart
walked
slowly
along
the
man
stopped
under
her
window
and
looking
up
called
her
by
name
she
was
retiring
precipitately
but
a
second
summons
inducing
her
to
reply
the
soldier
then
respectfully
asked
if
she
had
seen
anything
pass
on
her
answering
that
she
had
he
said
no
more
but
walked
away
down
the
terrace
emily
following
him
with
her
eyes
till
he
was
lost
in
the
distance
but
as
he
was
on
guard
she
knew
he
could
not
go
beyond
the
rampart
and
therefore
resolved
to
await
his
return
soon
after
his
voice
was
heard
at
a
distance
calling
loudly
and
then
a
voice
still
more
distant
answered
and
in
the
next
moment
the
watch-word
was
given
and
passed
along
the
terrace
as
the
soldiers
moved
hastily
under
the
casement
she
called
to
enquire
what
had
happened
but
they
passed
without
regarding
her
emilyâ€™s
thoughts
returning
to
the
figure
she
had
seen
â€œit
cannot
be
a
person
who
has
designs
upon
the
castleâ€
said
she
â€œsuch
a
one
would
conduct
himself
very
differently
he
would
not
venture
where
sentinels
were
on
watch
nor
fix
himself
opposite
to
a
window
where
he
perceived
he
must
be
observed
much
less
would
he
beckon
or
utter
a
sound
of
complaint
yet
it
cannot
be
a
prisoner
for
how
could
he
obtain
the
opportunity
to
wander
thusâ€
if
she
had
been
subject
to
vanity
she
might
have
supposed
this
figure
to
be
some
inhabitant
of
the
castle
who
wandered
under
her
casement
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
and
of
being
allowed
to
declare
his
admiration
but
this
opinion
never
occurred
to
emily
and
if
it
had
she
would
have
dismissed
it
as
improbable
on
considering
that
when
the
opportunity
of
speaking
had
occurred
it
had
been
suffered
to
pass
in
silence
and
that
even
at
the
moment
in
which
she
had
spoken
the
form
had
abruptly
quitted
the
place
while
she
mused
two
sentinels
walked
up
the
rampart
in
earnest
conversation
of
which
she
caught
a
few
words
and
learned
from
these
that
one
of
their
comrades
had
fallen
down
senseless
soon
after
three
other
soldiers
appeared
slowly
advancing
from
the
bottom
of
the
terrace
but
she
heard
only
a
low
voice
that
came
at
intervals
as
they
drew
near
she
perceived
this
to
be
the
voice
of
him
who
walked
in
the
middle
apparently
supported
by
his
comrades
and
she
again
called
to
them
enquiring
what
had
happened
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
they
stopped
and
looked
up
while
she
repeated
her
question
and
was
told
that
roberto
their
fellow
of
the
watch
had
been
seized
with
a
fit
and
that
his
cry
as
he
fell
had
caused
a
false
alarm
â€œis
he
subject
to
fitsâ€
said
emily
â€œyes
signoraâ€
replied
roberto
â€œbut
if
i
had
not
what
i
saw
was
enough
to
have
frightened
the
pope
himselfâ€
â€œwhat
was
itâ€
enquired
emily
trembling
â€œi
cannot
tell
what
it
was
lady
or
what
i
saw
or
how
it
vanishedâ€
replied
the
soldier
who
seemed
to
shudder
at
the
recollection
â€œwas
it
the
person
whom
you
followed
down
the
rampart
that
has
occasioned
you
this
alarmâ€
said
emily
endeavouring
to
conceal
her
own
â€œpersonâ€
exclaimed
the
manâ€”â€œit
was
the
devil
and
this
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
seen
himâ€
â€œnor
will
it
be
the
lastâ€
observed
one
of
his
comrades
laughing
â€œno
no
i
warrant
notâ€
said
another
â€œwellâ€
rejoined
roberto
â€œyou
may
be
as
merry
now
as
you
please
you
were
none
so
jocose
the
other
night
sebastian
when
you
were
on
watch
with
launcelotâ€
â€œlauncelot
need
not
talk
of
thatâ€
replied
sebastian
â€œlet
him
remember
how
he
stood
trembling
and
unable
to
give
the
word
till
the
man
was
gone
if
the
man
had
not
come
so
silently
upon
us
i
would
have
seized
him
and
soon
made
him
tell
who
he
wasâ€
â€œwhat
manâ€
enquired
emily
â€œit
was
no
man
ladyâ€
said
launcelot
who
stood
by
â€œbut
the
devil
himself
as
my
comrade
says
what
man
who
does
not
live
in
the
castle
could
get
within
the
walls
at
midnight
why
i
might
just
as
well
pretend
to
march
to
venice
and
get
among
all
the
senators
when
they
are
counselling
and
i
warrant
i
should
have
more
chance
of
getting
out
again
alive
than
any
fellow
that
we
should
catch
within
the
gates
after
dark
so
i
think
i
have
proved
plainly
enough
that
this
can
be
nobody
that
lives
out
of
the
castle
and
now
i
will
prove
that
it
can
be
nobody
that
lives
in
the
castleâ€”for
if
he
didâ€”why
should
he
be
afraid
to
be
seen
so
after
this
i
hope
nobody
will
pretend
to
tell
me
it
was
anybody
no
i
say
again
by
holy
pope
it
was
the
devil
and
sebastian
there
knows
this
is
not
the
first
time
we
have
seen
himâ€
â€œwhen
did
you
see
the
figure
then
beforeâ€
said
emily
half
smiling
who
though
she
thought
the
conversation
somewhat
too
much
felt
an
interest
which
would
not
permit
her
to
conclude
it
â€œabout
a
week
ago
ladyâ€
said
sebastian
taking
up
the
story
â€œand
whereâ€
â€œon
the
rampart
lady
higher
upâ€
â€œdid
you
pursue
it
that
it
fledâ€
â€œno
signora
launcelot
and
i
were
on
watch
together
and
everything
was
so
still
you
might
have
heard
a
mouse
stir
when
suddenly
launcelot
saysâ€”sebastian
do
you
see
nothing
i
turned
my
head
a
little
to
the
left
as
it
might
beâ€”thus
no
says
i
hush
said
launcelotâ€”look
yonderâ€”just
by
the
last
cannon
on
the
rampart
i
looked
and
then
thought
i
did
see
something
move
but
there
being
no
light
but
what
the
stars
gave
i
could
not
be
certain
we
stood
quite
silent
to
watch
it
and
presently
saw
something
pass
along
the
castle
wall
just
opposite
to
usâ€
â€œwhy
did
you
not
seize
it
thenâ€
cried
a
soldier
who
had
scarcely
spoken
till
now
â€œaye
why
did
you
not
seize
itâ€
said
roberto
â€œyou
should
have
been
there
to
have
done
thatâ€
replied
sebastian
â€œyou
would
have
been
bold
enough
to
have
taken
it
by
the
throat
though
it
had
been
the
devil
himself
we
could
not
take
such
a
liberty
perhaps
because
we
are
not
so
well
acquainted
with
him
as
you
are
but
as
i
was
saying
it
stole
by
us
so
quickly
that
we
had
not
time
to
get
rid
of
our
surprise
before
it
was
gone
then
we
knew
it
was
in
vain
to
follow
we
kept
constant
watch
all
that
night
but
we
saw
it
no
more
next
morning
we
told
some
of
our
comrades
who
were
on
duty
on
other
parts
of
the
ramparts
what
we
had
seen
but
they
had
seen
nothing
and
laughed
at
us
and
it
was
not
till
tonight
that
the
same
figure
walked
againâ€
â€œwhere
did
you
lose
it
friendâ€
said
emily
to
roberto
â€œwhen
i
left
you
ladyâ€
replied
the
man
â€œyou
might
see
me
go
down
the
rampart
but
it
was
not
till
i
reached
the
east
terrace
that
i
saw
anything
then
the
moon
shining
bright
i
saw
something
like
a
shadow
flitting
before
me
as
it
were
at
some
distance
i
stopped
when
i
turned
the
corner
of
the
east
tower
where
i
had
seen
this
figure
not
a
moment
beforeâ€”but
it
was
gone
as
i
stood
looking
through
the
old
arch
which
leads
to
the
east
rampart
and
where
i
am
sure
it
had
passed
i
heard
all
of
a
sudden
such
a
soundâ€”it
was
not
like
a
groan
or
a
cry
or
a
shout
or
anything
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
i
heard
it
only
once
and
that
was
enough
for
me
for
i
know
nothing
that
happened
after
till
i
found
my
comrades
here
about
meâ€
â€œcomeâ€
said
sebastian
â€œlet
us
go
to
our
postsâ€”the
moon
is
setting
good
night
ladyâ€
â€œaye
let
us
goâ€
rejoined
roberto
â€œgood
night
ladyâ€
â€œgood
night
the
holy
mother
guard
youâ€
said
emily
as
she
closed
her
casement
and
retired
to
reflect
upon
the
strange
circumstance
that
had
just
occurred
connecting
which
with
what
had
happened
on
former
nights
she
endeavoured
to
derive
from
the
whole
something
more
positive
than
conjecture
but
her
imagination
was
inflamed
while
her
judgment
was
not
enlightened
and
the
terrors
of
superstition
again
pervaded
her
mind
there
is
one
within
besides
the
things
that
we
have
heard
and
seen
recounts
most
horrid
sights
seen
by
the
watch
julius
cã†sar
in
the
morning
emily
found
madame
montoni
nearly
in
the
same
condition
as
on
the
preceding
night
she
had
slept
little
and
that
little
had
not
refreshed
her
she
smiled
on
her
niece
and
seemed
cheered
by
her
presence
but
spoke
only
a
few
words
and
never
named
montoni
who
however
soon
after
entered
the
room
his
wife
when
she
understood
that
he
was
there
appeared
much
agitated
but
was
entirely
silent
till
emily
rose
from
a
chair
at
the
bedside
when
she
begged
in
a
feeble
voice
that
she
would
not
leave
her
the
visit
of
montoni
was
not
to
sooth
his
wife
whom
he
knew
to
be
dying
or
to
console
or
to
ask
her
forgiveness
but
to
make
a
last
effort
to
procure
that
signature
which
would
transfer
her
estates
in
languedoc
after
her
death
to
him
rather
than
to
emily
this
was
a
scene
that
exhibited
on
his
part
his
usual
inhumanity
and
on
that
of
madame
montoni
a
persevering
spirit
contending
with
a
feeble
frame
while
emily
repeatedly
declared
to
him
her
willingness
to
resign
all
claim
to
those
estates
rather
than
that
the
last
hours
of
her
aunt
should
be
disturbed
by
contention
montoni
however
did
not
leave
the
room
till
his
wife
exhausted
by
the
obstinate
dispute
had
fainted
and
she
lay
so
long
insensible
that
emily
began
to
fear
that
the
spark
of
life
was
extinguished
at
length
she
revived
and
looking
feebly
up
at
her
niece
whose
tears
were
falling
over
her
made
an
effort
to
speak
but
her
words
were
unintelligible
and
emily
again
apprehended
she
was
dying
afterwards
however
she
recovered
her
speech
and
being
somewhat
restored
by
a
cordial
conversed
for
a
considerable
time
on
the
subject
of
her
estates
in
france
with
clearness
and
precision
she
directed
her
niece
where
to
find
some
papers
relative
to
them
which
she
had
hitherto
concealed
from
the
search
of
montoni
and
earnestly
charged
her
never
to
suffer
these
papers
to
escape
her
soon
after
this
conversation
madame
montoni
sunk
into
a
dose
and
continued
slumbering
till
evening
when
she
seemed
better
than
she
had
been
since
her
removal
from
the
turret
emily
never
left
her
for
a
moment
till
long
after
midnight
and
even
then
would
not
have
quitted
the
room
had
not
her
aunt
entreated
that
she
would
retire
to
rest
she
then
obeyed
the
more
willingly
because
her
patient
appeared
somewhat
recruited
by
sleep
and
giving
annette
the
same
injunction
as
on
the
preceding
night
she
withdrew
to
her
own
apartment
but
her
spirits
were
wakeful
and
agitated
and
finding
it
impossible
to
sleep
she
determined
to
watch
once
more
for
the
mysterious
appearance
that
had
so
much
interested
and
alarmed
her
it
was
now
the
second
watch
of
the
night
and
about
the
time
when
the
figure
had
before
appeared
emily
heard
the
passing
steps
of
the
sentinels
on
the
rampart
as
they
changed
guard
and
when
all
was
again
silent
she
took
her
station
at
the
casement
leaving
her
lamp
in
a
remote
part
of
the
chamber
that
she
might
escape
notice
from
without
the
moon
gave
a
faint
and
uncertain
light
for
heavy
vapours
surrounded
it
and
often
rolling
over
the
disk
left
the
scene
below
in
total
darkness
it
was
in
one
of
these
moments
of
obscurity
that
she
observed
a
small
and
lambent
flame
moving
at
some
distance
on
the
terrace
while
she
gazed
it
disappeared
and
the
moon
again
emerging
from
the
lurid
and
heavy
thunder
clouds
she
turned
her
attention
to
the
heavens
where
the
vivid
lightnings
darted
from
cloud
to
cloud
and
flashed
silently
on
the
woods
below
she
loved
to
catch
in
the
momentary
gleam
the
gloomy
landscape
sometimes
a
cloud
opened
its
light
upon
a
distant
mountain
and
while
the
sudden
splendour
illumined
all
its
recesses
of
rock
and
wood
the
rest
of
the
scene
remained
in
deep
shadow
at
others
partial
features
of
the
castle
were
revealed
by
the
glimpseâ€”the
ancient
arch
leading
to
the
east
rampart
the
turret
above
or
the
fortifications
beyond
and
then
perhaps
the
whole
edifice
with
all
its
towers
its
dark
massy
walls
and
pointed
casements
would
appear
and
vanish
in
an
instant
emily
looking
again
upon
the
rampart
perceived
the
flame
she
had
seen
before
it
moved
onward
and
soon
after
she
thought
she
heard
a
footstep
the
light
appeared
and
disappeared
frequently
while
as
she
watched
it
glided
under
her
casements
and
at
the
same
instant
she
was
certain
that
a
footstep
passed
but
the
darkness
did
not
permit
her
to
distinguish
any
object
except
the
flame
it
moved
away
and
then
by
a
gleam
of
lightning
she
perceived
some
person
on
the
terrace
all
the
anxieties
of
the
preceding
night
returned
this
person
advanced
and
the
playing
flame
alternately
appeared
and
vanished
emily
wished
to
speak
to
end
her
doubts
whether
this
figure
were
human
or
supernatural
but
her
courage
failed
as
often
as
she
attempted
utterance
till
the
light
moved
again
under
the
casement
and
she
faintly
demanded
who
passed
â€œa
friendâ€
replied
a
voice
â€œwhat
friendâ€
said
emily
somewhat
encouraged
â€œwho
are
you
and
what
is
that
light
you
carryâ€
â€œi
am
anthonio
one
of
the
signorâ€™s
soldiersâ€
replied
the
voice
â€œand
what
is
that
tapering
light
you
bearâ€
said
emily
â€œsee
how
it
darts
upwardsâ€”and
now
it
vanishesâ€
â€œthis
light
ladyâ€
said
the
soldier
â€œhas
appeared
tonight
as
you
see
it
on
the
point
of
my
lance
ever
since
i
have
been
on
watch
but
what
it
means
i
cannot
tellâ€
â€œthis
is
very
strangeâ€
said
emily
â€œmy
fellow-guardâ€
continued
the
man
â€œhas
the
same
flame
on
his
arms
he
says
he
has
sometimes
seen
it
before
i
never
did
i
am
but
lately
come
to
the
castle
for
i
have
not
been
long
a
soldierâ€
â€œhow
does
your
comrade
account
for
itâ€
said
emily
â€œhe
says
it
is
an
omen
lady
and
bodes
no
goodâ€
â€œand
what
harm
can
it
bodeâ€
rejoined
emily
â€œhe
knows
not
so
much
as
that
ladyâ€
whether
emily
was
alarmed
by
this
omen
or
not
she
certainly
was
relieved
from
much
terror
by
discovering
this
man
to
be
only
a
soldier
on
duty
and
it
immediately
occurred
to
her
that
it
might
be
he
who
had
occasioned
so
much
alarm
on
the
preceding
night
there
were
however
some
circumstances
that
still
required
explanation
as
far
as
she
could
judge
by
the
faint
moonlight
that
had
assisted
her
observation
the
figure
she
had
seen
did
not
resemble
this
man
either
in
shape
or
size
besides
she
was
certain
it
had
carried
no
arms
the
silence
of
its
steps
if
steps
it
had
the
moaning
sounds
too
which
it
had
uttered
and
its
strange
disappearance
were
circumstances
of
mysterious
import
that
did
not
apply
with
probability
to
a
soldier
engaged
in
the
duty
of
his
guard
she
now
enquired
of
the
sentinel
whether
he
had
seen
any
person
besides
his
fellow
watch
walking
on
the
terrace
about
midnight
and
then
briefly
related
what
she
had
herself
observed
â€œi
was
not
on
guard
that
night
ladyâ€
replied
the
man
â€œbut
i
heard
of
what
happened
there
are
amongst
us
who
believe
strange
things
strange
stories
too
have
long
been
told
of
this
castle
but
it
is
no
business
of
mine
to
repeat
them
and
for
my
part
i
have
no
reason
to
complain
our
chief
does
nobly
by
usâ€
â€œi
commend
your
prudenceâ€
said
emily
â€œgood
night
and
accept
this
from
meâ€
she
added
throwing
him
a
small
piece
of
coin
and
then
closing
the
casement
to
put
an
end
to
the
discourse
when
he
was
gone
she
opened
it
again
listened
with
a
gloomy
pleasure
to
the
distant
thunder
that
began
to
murmur
among
the
mountains
and
watched
the
arrowy
lightnings
which
broke
over
the
remoter
scene
the
pealing
thunder
rolled
onward
and
then
reverbed
by
the
mountains
other
thunder
seemed
to
answer
from
the
opposite
horizon
while
the
accumulating
clouds
entirely
concealing
the
moon
assumed
a
red
sulphureous
tinge
that
foretold
a
violent
storm
emily
remained
at
her
casement
till
the
vivid
lightning
that
now
every
instant
revealed
the
wide
horizon
and
the
landscape
below
made
it
no
longer
safe
to
do
so
and
she
went
to
her
couch
but
unable
to
compose
her
mind
to
sleep
still
listened
in
silent
awe
to
the
tremendous
sounds
that
seemed
to
shake
the
castle
to
its
foundation
she
had
continued
thus
for
a
considerable
time
when
amidst
the
uproar
of
the
storm
she
thought
she
heard
a
voice
and
raising
herself
to
listen
saw
the
chamber
door
open
and
annette
enter
with
a
countenance
of
wild
affright
â€œshe
is
dying
maâ€™amselle
my
lady
is
dyingâ€
said
she
emily
started
up
and
ran
to
madame
montoniâ€™s
room
when
she
entered
her
aunt
appeared
to
have
fainted
for
she
was
quite
still
and
insensible
and
emily
with
a
strength
of
mind
that
refused
to
yield
to
grief
while
any
duty
required
her
activity
applied
every
means
that
seemed
likely
to
restore
her
but
the
last
struggle
was
overâ€”she
was
gone
for
ever
when
emily
perceived
that
all
her
efforts
were
ineffectual
she
interrogated
the
terrified
annette
and
learned
that
madame
montoni
had
fallen
into
a
doze
soon
after
emilyâ€™s
departure
in
which
she
had
continued
until
a
few
minutes
before
her
death
â€œi
wondered
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œwhat
was
the
reason
my
lady
did
not
seem
frightened
at
the
thunder
when
i
was
so
terrified
and
i
went
often
to
the
bed
to
speak
to
her
but
she
appeared
to
be
asleep
till
presently
i
heard
a
strange
noise
and
on
going
to
her
saw
she
was
dyingâ€
emily
at
this
recital
shed
tears
she
had
no
doubt
but
that
the
violent
change
in
the
air
which
the
tempest
produced
had
effected
this
fatal
one
on
the
exhausted
frame
of
madame
montoni
after
some
deliberation
she
determined
that
montoni
should
not
be
informed
of
this
event
till
the
morning
for
she
considered
that
he
might
perhaps
utter
some
inhuman
expressions
such
as
in
the
present
temper
of
her
spirits
she
could
not
bear
with
annette
alone
therefore
whom
she
encouraged
by
her
own
example
she
performed
some
of
the
last
solemn
offices
for
the
dead
and
compelled
herself
to
watch
during
the
night
by
the
body
of
her
deceased
aunt
during
this
solemn
period
rendered
more
awful
by
the
tremendous
storm
that
shook
the
air
she
frequently
addressed
herself
to
heaven
for
support
and
protection
and
her
pious
prayers
we
may
believe
were
accepted
of
the
god
that
giveth
comfort
the
midnight
clock
has
tollâ€™d
and
hark
the
bell
of
death
beats
slow
heard
ye
the
note
profound
it
pauses
now
and
now
with
rising
knell
flings
to
the
hollow
gale
its
sullen
sound
mason
when
montoni
was
informed
of
the
death
of
his
wife
and
considered
that
she
had
died
without
giving
him
the
signature
so
necessary
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
wishes
no
sense
of
decency
restrained
the
expression
of
his
resentment
emily
anxiously
avoided
his
presence
and
watched
during
two
days
and
two
nights
with
little
intermission
by
the
corpse
of
her
late
aunt
her
mind
deeply
impressed
with
the
unhappy
fate
of
this
object
she
forgot
all
her
faults
her
unjust
and
imperious
conduct
to
herself
and
remembering
only
her
sufferings
thought
of
her
only
with
tender
compassion
sometimes
however
she
could
not
avoid
musing
upon
the
strange
infatuation
that
had
proved
so
fatal
to
her
aunt
and
had
involved
herself
in
a
labyrinth
of
misfortune
from
which
she
saw
no
means
of
escapingâ€”the
marriage
with
montoni
but
when
she
considered
this
circumstance
it
was
â€œmore
in
sorrow
than
in
angerâ€â€”more
for
the
purpose
of
indulging
lamentation
than
reproach
in
her
pious
cares
she
was
not
disturbed
by
montoni
who
not
only
avoided
the
chamber
where
the
remains
of
his
wife
were
laid
but
that
part
of
the
castle
adjoining
to
it
as
if
he
had
apprehended
a
contagion
in
death
he
seemed
to
have
given
no
orders
respecting
the
funeral
and
emily
began
to
fear
he
meant
to
offer
a
new
insult
to
the
memory
of
madame
montoni
but
from
this
apprehension
she
was
relieved
when
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
annette
informed
her
that
the
interment
was
to
take
place
that
night
she
knew
that
montoni
would
not
attend
and
it
was
so
very
grievous
to
her
to
think
that
the
remains
of
her
unfortunate
aunt
would
pass
to
the
grave
without
one
relative
or
friend
to
pay
them
the
last
decent
rites
that
she
determined
to
be
deterred
by
no
considerations
for
herself
from
observing
this
duty
she
would
otherwise
have
shrunk
from
the
circumstance
of
following
them
to
the
cold
vault
to
which
they
were
to
be
carried
by
men
whose
air
and
countenances
seemed
to
stamp
them
for
murderers
at
the
midnight
hour
of
silence
and
privacy
which
montoni
had
chosen
for
committing
if
possible
to
oblivion
the
reliques
of
a
woman
whom
his
harsh
conduct
had
at
least
contributed
to
destroy
emily
shuddering
with
emotions
of
horror
and
grief
assisted
by
annette
prepared
the
corpse
for
interment
and
having
wrapt
it
in
cerements
and
covered
it
with
a
winding-sheet
they
watched
beside
it
till
past
midnight
when
they
heard
the
approaching
footsteps
of
the
men
who
were
to
lay
it
in
its
earthy
bed
it
was
with
difficulty
that
emily
overcame
her
emotion
when
the
door
of
the
chamber
being
thrown
open
their
gloomy
countenances
were
seen
by
the
glare
of
the
torch
they
carried
and
two
of
them
without
speaking
lifted
the
body
on
their
shoulders
while
the
third
preceding
them
with
the
light
descended
through
the
castle
towards
the
grave
which
was
in
the
lower
vault
of
the
chapel
within
the
castle
walls
they
had
to
cross
two
courts
towards
the
east
wing
of
the
castle
which
adjoining
the
chapel
was
like
it
in
ruins
but
the
silence
and
gloom
of
these
courts
had
now
little
power
over
emilyâ€™s
mind
occupied
as
it
was
with
more
mournful
ideas
and
she
scarcely
heard
the
low
and
dismal
hooting
of
the
night-birds
that
roosted
among
the
ivied
battlements
of
the
ruin
or
perceived
the
still
flittings
of
the
bat
which
frequently
crossed
her
way
but
when
having
entered
the
chapel
and
passed
between
the
mouldering
pillars
of
the
aisles
the
bearers
stopped
at
a
flight
of
steps
that
led
down
to
a
low
arched
door
and
their
comrade
having
descended
to
unlock
it
she
saw
imperfectly
the
gloomy
abyss
beyondâ€”saw
the
corpse
of
her
aunt
carried
down
these
steps
and
the
ruffian-like
figure
that
stood
with
a
torch
at
the
bottom
to
receive
itâ€”all
her
fortitude
was
lost
in
emotions
of
inexpressible
grief
and
terror
she
turned
to
lean
upon
annette
who
was
cold
and
trembling
like
herself
and
she
lingered
so
long
on
the
summit
of
the
flight
that
the
gleam
of
the
torch
began
to
die
away
on
the
pillars
of
the
chapel
and
the
men
were
almost
beyond
her
view
then
the
gloom
around
her
awakening
other
fears
and
a
sense
of
what
she
considered
to
be
her
duty
overcoming
her
reluctance
she
descended
to
the
vaults
following
the
echo
of
footsteps
and
the
faint
ray
that
pierced
the
darkness
till
the
harsh
grating
of
a
distant
door
that
was
opened
to
receive
the
corpse
again
appalled
her
after
the
pause
of
a
moment
she
went
on
and
as
she
entered
the
vaults
saw
between
the
arches
at
some
distance
the
men
lay
down
the
body
near
the
edge
of
an
open
grave
where
stood
another
of
montoniâ€™s
men
and
a
priest
whom
she
did
not
observe
till
he
began
the
burial
service
then
lifting
her
eyes
from
the
ground
she
saw
the
venerable
figure
of
the
friar
and
heard
him
in
a
low
voice
equally
solemn
and
affecting
perform
the
service
for
the
dead
at
the
moment
in
which
they
let
down
the
body
into
the
earth
the
scene
was
such
as
only
the
dark
pencil
of
a
domenichino
perhaps
could
have
done
justice
to
the
fierce
features
and
wild
dress
of
the
condottieri
bending
with
their
torches
over
the
grave
into
which
the
corpse
was
descending
were
contrasted
by
the
venerable
figure
of
the
monk
wrapt
in
long
black
garments
his
cowl
thrown
back
from
his
pale
face
on
which
the
light
gleaming
strongly
showed
the
lines
of
affliction
softened
by
piety
and
the
few
grey
locks
which
time
had
spared
on
his
temples
while
beside
him
stood
the
softer
form
of
emily
who
leaned
for
support
upon
annette
her
face
half
averted
and
shaded
by
a
thin
veil
that
fell
over
her
figure
and
her
mild
and
beautiful
countenance
fixed
in
grief
so
solemn
as
admitted
not
of
tears
while
she
thus
saw
committed
untimely
to
the
earth
her
last
relative
and
friend
the
gleams
thrown
between
the
arches
of
the
vaults
where
here
and
there
the
broken
ground
marked
the
spots
in
which
other
bodies
had
been
recently
interred
and
the
general
obscurity
beyond
were
circumstances
that
alone
would
have
led
on
the
imagination
of
a
spectator
to
scenes
more
horrible
than
even
that
which
was
pictured
at
the
grave
of
the
misguided
and
unfortunate
madame
montoni
when
the
service
was
over
the
friar
regarded
emily
with
attention
and
surprise
and
looked
as
if
he
wished
to
speak
to
her
but
was
restrained
by
the
presence
of
the
condottieri
who
as
they
now
led
the
way
to
the
courts
amused
themselves
with
jokes
upon
his
holy
order
which
he
endured
in
silence
demanding
only
to
be
conducted
safely
to
his
convent
and
to
which
emily
listened
with
concern
and
even
horror
when
they
reached
the
court
the
monk
gave
her
his
blessing
and
after
a
lingering
look
of
pity
turned
away
to
the
portal
whither
one
of
the
men
carried
a
torch
while
annette
lighting
another
preceded
emily
to
her
apartment
the
appearance
of
the
friar
and
the
expression
of
tender
compassion
with
which
he
had
regarded
her
had
interested
emily
who
though
it
was
at
her
earnest
supplication
that
montoni
had
consented
to
allow
a
priest
to
perform
the
last
rites
for
his
deceased
wife
knew
nothing
concerning
this
person
till
annette
now
informed
her
that
he
belonged
to
a
monastery
situated
among
the
mountains
at
a
few
miles
distance
the
superior
who
regarded
montoni
and
his
associates
not
only
with
aversion
but
with
terror
had
probably
feared
to
offend
him
by
refusing
his
request
and
had
therefore
ordered
a
monk
to
officiate
at
the
funeral
who
with
the
meek
spirit
of
a
christian
had
overcome
his
reluctance
to
enter
the
walls
of
such
a
castle
by
the
wish
of
performing
what
he
considered
to
be
his
duty
and
as
the
chapel
was
built
on
consecrated
ground
had
not
objected
to
commit
to
it
the
remains
of
the
late
unhappy
madame
montoni
several
days
passed
with
emily
in
total
seclusion
and
in
a
state
of
mind
partaking
both
of
terror
for
herself
and
grief
for
the
departed
she
at
length
determined
to
make
other
efforts
to
persuade
montoni
to
permit
her
return
to
france
why
he
should
wish
to
detain
her
she
could
scarcely
dare
to
conjecture
but
it
was
too
certain
that
he
did
so
and
the
absolute
refusal
he
had
formerly
given
to
her
departure
allowed
her
little
hope
that
he
would
now
consent
to
it
but
the
horror
which
his
presence
inspired
made
her
defer
from
day
to
day
the
mention
of
this
subject
and
at
last
she
was
awakened
from
her
inactivity
only
by
a
message
from
him
desiring
her
attendance
at
a
certain
hour
she
began
to
hope
he
meant
to
resign
now
that
her
aunt
was
no
more
the
authority
he
had
usurped
over
her
till
she
recollected
that
the
estates
which
had
occasioned
so
much
contention
were
now
hers
and
she
then
feared
montoni
was
about
to
employ
some
stratagem
for
obtaining
them
and
that
he
would
detain
her
his
prisoner
till
he
succeeded
this
thought
instead
of
overcoming
her
with
despondency
roused
all
the
latent
powers
of
her
fortitude
into
action
and
the
property
which
she
would
willingly
have
resigned
to
secure
the
peace
of
her
aunt
she
resolved
that
no
common
sufferings
of
her
own
should
ever
compel
her
to
give
to
montoni
for
valancourtâ€™s
sake
also
she
determined
to
preserve
these
estates
since
they
would
afford
that
competency
by
which
she
hoped
to
secure
the
comfort
of
their
future
lives
as
she
thought
of
this
she
indulged
the
tenderness
of
tears
and
anticipated
the
delight
of
that
moment
when
with
affectionate
generosity
she
might
tell
him
they
were
his
own
she
saw
the
smile
that
lighted
up
his
featuresâ€”the
affectionate
regard
which
spoke
at
once
his
joy
and
thanks
and
at
this
instant
she
believed
she
could
brave
any
suffering
which
the
evil
spirit
of
montoni
might
be
preparing
for
her
remembering
then
for
the
first
time
since
her
auntâ€™s
death
the
papers
relative
to
the
estates
in
question
she
determined
to
search
for
them
as
soon
as
her
interview
with
montoni
was
over
with
these
resolutions
she
met
him
at
the
appointed
time
and
waited
to
hear
his
intention
before
she
renewed
her
request
with
him
were
orsino
and
another
officer
and
both
were
standing
near
a
table
covered
with
papers
which
he
appeared
to
be
examining
â€œi
sent
for
you
emilyâ€
said
montoni
raising
his
head
â€œthat
you
might
be
a
witness
in
some
business
which
i
am
transacting
with
my
friend
orsino
all
that
is
required
of
you
will
be
to
sign
your
name
to
this
paperâ€
he
then
took
one
up
hurried
unintelligibly
over
some
lines
and
laying
it
before
her
on
the
table
offered
her
a
pen
she
took
it
and
was
going
to
writeâ€”when
the
design
of
montoni
came
upon
her
mind
like
a
flash
of
lightning
she
trembled
let
the
pen
fall
and
refused
to
sign
what
she
had
not
read
montoni
affected
to
laugh
at
her
scruples
and
taking
up
the
paper
again
pretended
to
read
but
emily
who
still
trembled
on
perceiving
her
danger
and
was
astonished
that
her
own
credulity
had
so
nearly
betrayed
her
positively
refused
to
sign
any
paper
whatever
montoni
for
some
time
persevered
in
affecting
to
ridicule
this
refusal
but
when
he
perceived
by
her
steady
perseverance
that
she
understood
his
design
he
changed
his
manner
and
bade
her
follow
him
to
another
room
there
he
told
her
that
he
had
been
willing
to
spare
himself
and
her
the
trouble
of
useless
contest
in
an
affair
where
his
will
was
justice
and
where
she
should
find
it
law
and
had
therefore
endeavoured
to
persuade
rather
than
to
compel
her
to
the
practice
of
her
duty
â€œi
as
the
husband
of
the
late
signora
montoniâ€
he
added
â€œam
the
heir
of
all
she
possessed
the
estates
therefore
which
she
refused
to
me
in
her
life-time
can
no
longer
be
withheld
and
for
your
own
sake
i
would
undeceive
you
respecting
a
foolish
assertion
she
once
made
to
you
in
my
hearingâ€”that
these
estates
would
be
yours
if
she
died
without
resigning
them
to
me
she
knew
at
that
moment
she
had
no
power
to
withhold
them
from
me
after
her
decease
and
i
think
you
have
more
sense
than
to
provoke
my
resentment
by
advancing
an
unjust
claim
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
flattering
and
you
will
therefore
receive
as
sincere
the
praise
i
bestow
when
i
say
that
you
possess
an
understanding
superior
to
that
of
your
sex
and
that
you
have
none
of
those
contemptible
foibles
that
frequently
mark
the
female
characterâ€”such
as
avarice
and
the
love
of
power
which
latter
makes
women
delight
to
contradict
and
to
tease
when
they
cannot
conquer
if
i
understand
your
disposition
and
your
mind
you
hold
in
sovereign
contempt
these
common
failings
of
your
sexâ€
montoni
paused
and
emily
remained
silent
and
expecting
for
she
knew
him
too
well
to
believe
he
would
condescend
to
such
flattery
unless
he
thought
it
would
promote
his
own
interest
and
though
he
had
forborne
to
name
vanity
among
the
foibles
of
women
it
was
evident
that
he
considered
it
to
be
a
predominant
one
since
he
designed
to
sacrifice
to
hers
the
character
and
understanding
of
her
whole
sex
â€œjudging
as
i
doâ€
resumed
montoni
â€œi
cannot
believe
you
will
oppose
where
you
know
you
cannot
conquer
or
indeed
that
you
would
wish
to
conquer
or
be
avaricious
of
any
property
when
you
have
not
justice
on
your
side
i
think
it
proper
however
to
acquaint
you
with
the
alternative
if
you
have
a
just
opinion
of
the
subject
in
question
you
shall
be
allowed
a
safe
conveyance
to
france
within
a
short
period
but
if
you
are
so
unhappy
as
to
be
misled
by
the
late
assertion
of
the
signora
you
shall
remain
my
prisoner
till
you
are
convinced
of
your
errorâ€
emily
calmly
said
â€œi
am
not
so
ignorant
signor
of
the
laws
on
this
subject
as
to
be
misled
by
the
assertion
of
any
person
the
law
in
the
present
instance
gives
me
the
estates
in
question
and
my
own
hand
shall
never
betray
my
rightâ€
â€œi
have
been
mistaken
in
my
opinion
of
you
it
appearsâ€
rejoined
montoni
sternly
â€œyou
speak
boldly
and
presumptuously
upon
a
subject
which
you
do
not
understand
for
once
i
am
willing
to
pardon
the
conceit
of
ignorance
the
weakness
of
your
sex
too
from
which
it
seems
you
are
not
exempt
claims
some
allowance
but
if
you
persist
in
this
strainâ€”you
have
everything
to
fear
from
my
justiceâ€
â€œfrom
your
justice
signorâ€
rejoined
emily
â€œi
have
nothing
to
fearâ€”i
have
only
to
hopeâ€
montoni
looked
at
her
with
vexation
and
seemed
considering
what
to
say
â€œi
find
that
you
are
weak
enoughâ€
he
resumed
â€œto
credit
the
idle
assertion
i
alluded
to
for
your
own
sake
i
lament
this
as
to
me
it
is
of
little
consequence
your
credulity
can
punish
only
yourself
and
i
must
pity
the
weakness
of
mind
which
leads
you
to
so
much
suffering
as
you
are
compelling
me
to
prepare
for
youâ€
â€œyou
may
find
perhaps
signorâ€
said
emily
with
mild
dignity
â€œthat
the
strength
of
my
mind
is
equal
to
the
justice
of
my
cause
and
that
i
can
endure
with
fortitude
when
it
is
in
resistance
of
oppressionâ€
â€œyou
speak
like
a
heroineâ€
said
montoni
contemptuously
â€œwe
shall
see
whether
you
can
suffer
like
oneâ€
emily
was
silent
and
he
left
the
room
recollecting
that
it
was
for
valancourtâ€™s
sake
she
had
thus
resisted
she
now
smiled
complacently
upon
the
threatened
sufferings
and
retired
to
the
spot
which
her
aunt
had
pointed
out
as
the
repository
of
the
papers
relative
to
the
estates
where
she
found
them
as
described
and
since
she
knew
of
no
better
place
of
concealment
than
this
returned
them
without
examining
their
contents
being
fearful
of
discovery
while
she
should
attempt
a
perusal
to
her
own
solitary
chamber
she
once
more
returned
and
there
thought
again
of
the
late
conversation
with
montoni
and
of
the
evil
she
might
expect
from
opposition
to
his
will
but
his
power
did
not
appear
so
terrible
to
her
imagination
as
it
was
wont
to
do
a
sacred
pride
was
in
her
heart
that
taught
it
to
swell
against
the
pressure
of
injustice
and
almost
to
glory
in
the
quiet
sufferance
of
ills
in
a
cause
which
had
also
the
interest
of
valancourt
for
its
object
for
the
first
time
she
felt
the
full
extent
of
her
own
superiority
to
montoni
and
despised
the
authority
which
till
now
she
had
only
feared
as
she
sat
musing
a
peal
of
laughter
rose
from
the
terrace
and
on
going
to
the
casement
she
saw
with
inexpressible
surprise
three
ladies
dressed
in
the
gala
habit
of
venice
walking
with
several
gentlemen
below
she
gazed
in
an
astonishment
that
made
her
remain
at
the
window
regardless
of
being
observed
till
the
group
passed
under
it
and
one
of
the
strangers
looking
up
she
perceived
the
features
of
signora
livona
with
whose
manners
she
had
been
so
much
charmed
the
day
after
her
arrival
at
venice
and
who
had
been
there
introduced
at
the
table
of
montoni
this
discovery
occasioned
her
an
emotion
of
doubtful
joy
for
it
was
matter
of
joy
and
comfort
to
know
that
a
person
of
a
mind
so
gentle
as
that
of
signora
livona
seemed
to
be
was
near
her
yet
there
was
something
so
extraordinary
in
her
being
at
this
castle
circumstanced
as
it
now
was
and
evidently
by
the
gaiety
of
her
air
with
her
own
consent
that
a
very
painful
surmise
arose
concerning
her
character
but
the
thought
was
so
shocking
to
emily
whose
affection
the
fascinating
manners
of
the
signora
had
won
and
appeared
so
improbable
when
she
remembered
these
manners
that
she
dismissed
it
almost
instantly
on
annetteâ€™s
appearance
however
she
enquired
concerning
these
strangers
and
the
former
was
as
eager
to
tell
as
emily
was
to
learn
â€œthey
are
just
come
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œwith
two
signors
from
venice
and
i
was
glad
to
see
such
christian
faces
once
againâ€”but
what
can
they
mean
by
coming
here
they
must
surely
be
stark
mad
to
come
freely
to
such
a
place
as
this
yet
they
do
come
freely
for
they
seem
merry
enough
i
am
sureâ€
â€œthey
were
taken
prisoners
perhapsâ€
said
emily
â€œtaken
prisonersâ€
exclaimed
annette
â€œno
indeed
maâ€™amselle
not
they
i
remember
one
of
them
very
well
at
venice
she
came
two
or
three
times
to
the
signorâ€™s
you
know
maâ€™amselle
and
it
was
said
but
i
did
not
believe
a
word
of
itâ€”it
was
said
that
the
signor
liked
her
better
than
he
should
do
then
why
says
i
bring
her
to
my
lady
very
true
said
ludovico
but
he
looked
as
if
he
knew
more
tooâ€
emily
desired
annette
would
endeavour
to
learn
who
these
ladies
were
as
well
as
all
she
could
concerning
them
and
she
then
changed
the
subject
and
spoke
of
distant
france
â€œah
maâ€™amselle
we
shall
never
see
it
moreâ€
said
annette
almost
weepingâ€”â€œi
must
come
on
my
travels
forsoothâ€
emily
tried
to
sooth
and
to
cheer
her
with
a
hope
in
which
she
scarcely
herself
indulged
â€œhowâ€”how
maâ€™amselle
could
you
leave
france
and
leave
mons
valancourt
tooâ€
said
annette
sobbing
â€œiâ€”iâ€”am
sure
if
ludovico
had
been
in
france
i
would
never
have
left
itâ€
â€œwhy
do
you
lament
quitting
france
thenâ€
said
emily
trying
to
smile
â€œsince
if
you
had
remained
there
you
would
not
have
found
ludovicoâ€
â€œah
maâ€™amselle
i
only
wish
i
was
out
of
this
frightful
castle
serving
you
in
france
and
i
would
care
about
nothing
elseâ€
â€œthank
you
my
good
annette
for
your
affectionate
regard
the
time
will
come
i
hope
when
you
may
remember
the
expression
of
that
wish
with
pleasureâ€
annette
departed
on
her
business
and
emily
sought
to
lose
the
sense
of
her
own
cares
in
the
visionary
scenes
of
the
poet
but
she
had
again
to
lament
the
irresistible
force
of
circumstances
over
the
taste
and
powers
of
the
mind
and
that
it
requires
a
spirit
at
ease
to
be
sensible
even
to
the
abstract
pleasures
of
pure
intellect
the
enthusiasm
of
genius
with
all
its
pictured
scenes
now
appeared
cold
and
dim
as
she
mused
upon
the
book
before
her
she
involuntarily
exclaimed
â€œare
these
indeed
the
passages
that
have
so
often
given
me
exquisite
delight
where
did
the
charm
existâ€”was
it
in
my
mind
or
in
the
imagination
of
the
poet
it
lived
in
eachâ€
said
she
pausing
â€œbut
the
fire
of
the
poet
is
vain
if
the
mind
of
his
reader
is
not
tempered
like
his
own
however
it
may
be
inferior
to
his
in
powerâ€
emily
would
have
pursued
this
train
of
thinking
because
it
relieved
her
from
more
painful
reflection
but
she
found
again
that
thought
cannot
always
be
controlled
by
will
and
hers
returned
to
the
consideration
of
her
own
situation
in
the
evening
not
choosing
to
venture
down
to
the
ramparts
where
she
would
be
exposed
to
the
rude
gaze
of
montoniâ€™s
associates
she
walked
for
air
in
the
gallery
adjoining
her
chamber
on
reaching
the
further
end
of
which
she
heard
distant
sounds
of
merriment
and
laughter
it
was
the
wild
uproar
of
riot
not
the
cheering
gaiety
of
tempered
mirth
and
seemed
to
come
from
that
part
of
the
castle
where
montoni
usually
was
such
sounds
at
this
time
when
her
aunt
had
been
so
few
days
dead
particularly
shocked
her
consistent
as
they
were
with
the
late
conduct
of
montoni
as
she
listened
she
thought
she
distinguished
female
voices
mingling
with
the
laughter
and
this
confirmed
her
worst
surmise
concerning
the
character
of
signora
livona
and
her
companions
it
was
evident
that
they
had
not
been
brought
hither
by
compulsion
and
she
beheld
herself
in
the
remote
wilds
of
the
apennine
surrounded
by
men
whom
she
considered
to
be
little
less
than
ruffians
and
their
worst
associates
amid
scenes
of
vice
from
which
her
soul
recoiled
in
horror
it
was
at
this
moment
when
the
scenes
of
the
present
and
the
future
opened
to
her
imagination
that
the
image
of
valancourt
failed
in
its
influence
and
her
resolution
shook
with
dread
she
thought
she
understood
all
the
horrors
which
montoni
was
preparing
for
her
and
shrunk
from
an
encounter
with
such
remorseless
vengeance
as
he
could
inflict
the
disputed
estates
she
now
almost
determined
to
yield
at
once
whenever
he
should
again
call
upon
her
that
she
might
regain
safety
and
freedom
but
then
the
remembrance
of
valancourt
would
steal
to
her
heart
and
plunge
her
into
the
distractions
of
doubt
she
continued
walking
in
the
gallery
till
evening
threw
its
melancholy
twilight
through
the
painted
casements
and
deepened
the
gloom
of
the
oak
wainscoting
around
her
while
the
distant
perspective
of
the
corridor
was
so
much
obscured
as
to
be
discernible
only
by
the
glimmering
window
that
terminated
it
along
the
vaulted
halls
and
passages
below
peals
of
laughter
echoed
faintly
at
intervals
to
this
remote
part
of
the
castle
and
seemed
to
render
the
succeeding
stillness
more
dreary
emily
however
unwilling
to
return
to
her
more
forlorn
chamber
whither
annette
was
not
yet
come
still
paced
the
gallery
as
she
passed
the
door
of
the
apartment
where
she
had
once
dared
to
lift
the
veil
which
discovered
to
her
a
spectacle
so
horrible
that
she
had
never
after
remembered
it
but
with
emotions
of
indescribable
awe
this
remembrance
suddenly
recurred
it
now
brought
with
it
reflections
more
terrible
than
it
had
yet
done
which
the
late
conduct
of
montoni
occasioned
and
hastening
to
quit
the
gallery
while
she
had
power
to
do
so
she
heard
a
sudden
step
behind
herâ€”it
might
be
that
of
annette
but
turning
fearfully
to
look
she
saw
through
the
gloom
a
tall
figure
following
her
and
all
the
horrors
of
that
chamber
rushed
upon
her
mind
in
the
next
moment
she
found
herself
clasped
in
the
arms
of
some
person
and
heard
a
deep
voice
murmur
in
her
ear
when
she
had
power
to
speak
or
to
distinguish
articulated
sounds
she
demanded
who
detained
her
â€œit
is
iâ€
replied
the
voiceâ€”â€œwhy
are
you
thus
alarmedâ€
she
looked
on
the
face
of
the
person
who
spoke
but
the
feeble
light
that
gleamed
through
the
high
casement
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
did
not
permit
her
to
distinguish
the
features
â€œwhoever
you
areâ€
said
emily
in
a
trembling
voice
â€œfor
heavenâ€™s
sake
let
me
goâ€
â€œmy
charming
emilyâ€
said
the
man
â€œwhy
will
you
shut
yourself
up
in
this
obscure
place
when
there
is
so
much
gaiety
below
return
with
me
to
the
cedar
parlour
where
you
will
be
the
fairest
ornament
of
the
partyâ€”you
shall
not
repent
the
exchangeâ€
emily
disdained
to
reply
and
still
endeavoured
to
liberate
herself
â€œpromise
that
you
will
comeâ€
he
continued
â€œand
i
will
release
you
immediately
but
first
give
me
a
reward
for
so
doingâ€
â€œwho
are
youâ€
demanded
emily
in
a
tone
of
mingled
terror
and
indignation
while
she
still
struggled
for
libertyâ€”â€œwho
are
you
that
have
the
cruelty
thus
to
insult
meâ€
â€œwhy
call
me
cruelâ€
said
the
man
â€œi
would
remove
you
from
this
dreary
solitude
to
a
merry
party
below
do
you
not
know
meâ€
emily
now
faintly
remembered
that
he
was
one
of
the
officers
who
were
with
montoni
when
she
attended
him
in
the
morning
â€œi
thank
you
for
the
kindness
of
your
intentionâ€
she
replied
without
appearing
to
understand
him
â€œbut
i
wish
for
nothing
so
much
as
that
you
would
leave
meâ€
â€œcharming
emilyâ€
said
he
â€œgive
up
this
foolish
whim
for
solitude
and
come
with
me
to
the
company
and
eclipse
the
beauties
who
make
part
of
it
you
only
are
worthy
of
my
loveâ€
he
attempted
to
kiss
her
hand
but
the
strong
impulse
of
her
indignation
gave
her
power
to
liberate
herself
and
she
fled
towards
the
chamber
she
closed
the
door
before
he
reached
it
having
secured
which
she
sunk
in
a
chair
overcome
by
terror
and
by
the
exertion
she
had
made
while
she
heard
his
voice
and
his
attempts
to
open
the
door
without
having
the
power
to
raise
herself
at
length
she
perceived
him
depart
and
had
remained
listening
for
a
considerable
time
and
was
somewhat
revived
by
not
hearing
any
sound
when
suddenly
she
remembered
the
door
of
the
private
staircase
and
that
he
might
enter
that
way
since
it
was
fastened
only
on
the
other
side
she
then
employed
herself
in
endeavouring
to
secure
it
in
the
manner
she
had
formerly
done
it
appeared
to
her
that
montoni
had
already
commenced
his
scheme
of
vengeance
by
withdrawing
from
her
his
protection
and
she
repented
of
the
rashness
that
had
made
her
brave
the
power
of
such
a
man
to
retain
the
estates
seemed
to
be
now
utterly
impossible
and
to
preserve
her
life
perhaps
her
honour
she
resolved
if
she
should
escape
the
horrors
of
this
night
to
give
up
all
claims
to
the
estates
on
the
morrow
provided
montoni
would
suffer
her
to
depart
from
udolpho
when
she
had
come
to
this
decision
her
mind
became
more
composed
though
she
still
anxiously
listened
and
often
started
at
ideal
sounds
that
appeared
to
issue
from
the
staircase
having
sat
in
darkness
for
some
hours
during
all
which
time
annette
did
not
appear
she
began
to
have
serious
apprehensions
for
her
but
not
daring
to
venture
down
into
the
castle
was
compelled
to
remain
in
uncertainty
as
to
the
cause
of
this
unusual
absence
emily
often
stole
to
the
staircase
door
to
listen
if
any
step
approached
but
still
no
sound
alarmed
her
determining
however
to
watch
during
the
night
she
once
more
rested
on
her
dark
and
desolate
couch
and
bathed
the
pillow
with
innocent
tears
she
thought
of
her
deceased
parents
and
then
of
the
absent
valancourt
and
frequently
called
upon
their
names
for
the
profound
stillness
that
now
reigned
was
propitious
to
the
musing
sorrow
of
her
mind
while
she
thus
remained
her
ear
suddenly
caught
the
notes
of
distant
music
to
which
she
listened
attentively
and
soon
perceiving
this
to
be
the
instrument
she
had
formerly
heard
at
midnight
she
rose
and
stepped
softly
to
the
casement
to
which
the
sounds
appeared
to
come
from
a
lower
room
in
a
few
moments
their
soft
melody
was
accompanied
by
a
voice
so
full
of
pathos
that
it
evidently
sang
not
of
imaginary
sorrows
its
sweet
and
peculiar
tones
she
thought
she
had
somewhere
heard
before
yet
if
this
was
not
fancy
it
was
at
most
a
very
faint
recollection
it
stole
over
her
mind
amidst
the
anguish
of
her
present
suffering
like
a
celestial
strain
soothing
and
reassuring
herâ€”â€œpleasant
as
the
gale
of
spring
that
sighs
on
the
hunterâ€™s
ear
when
he
awakens
from
dreams
of
joy
and
has
heard
the
music
of
the
spirits
of
the
hillâ€
note
ossian
a
r
but
her
emotion
can
scarcely
be
imagined
when
she
heard
sung
with
the
taste
and
simplicity
of
true
feeling
one
of
the
popular
airs
of
her
native
province
to
which
she
had
so
often
listened
with
delight
when
a
child
and
which
she
had
so
often
heard
her
father
repeat
to
this
well-known
song
never
till
now
heard
but
in
her
native
country
her
heart
melted
while
the
memory
of
past
times
returned
the
pleasant
peaceful
scenes
of
gascony
the
tenderness
and
goodness
of
her
parents
the
taste
and
simplicity
of
her
former
lifeâ€”all
rose
to
her
fancy
and
formed
a
picture
so
sweet
and
glowing
so
strikingly
contrasted
with
the
scenes
the
characters
and
the
dangers
which
now
surrounded
herâ€”that
her
mind
could
not
bear
to
pause
upon
the
retrospect
and
shrunk
at
the
acuteness
of
its
own
sufferings
her
sighs
were
deep
and
convulsed
she
could
no
longer
listen
to
the
strain
that
had
so
often
charmed
her
to
tranquillity
and
she
withdrew
from
the
casement
to
a
remote
part
of
the
chamber
but
she
was
not
yet
beyond
the
reach
of
the
music
she
heard
the
measure
change
and
the
succeeding
air
called
her
again
to
the
window
for
she
immediately
recollected
it
to
be
the
same
she
had
formerly
heard
in
the
fishing-house
in
gascony
assisted
perhaps
by
the
mystery
which
had
then
accompanied
this
strain
it
had
made
so
deep
an
impression
on
her
memory
that
she
had
never
since
entirely
forgotten
it
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
now
sung
convinced
her
however
unaccountable
the
circumstances
appeared
that
this
was
the
same
voice
she
had
then
heard
surprise
soon
yielded
to
other
emotions
a
thought
darted
like
lightning
upon
her
mind
which
discovered
a
train
of
hopes
that
revived
all
her
spirits
yet
these
hopes
were
so
new
so
unexpected
so
astonishing
that
she
did
not
dare
to
trust
though
she
could
not
resolve
to
discourage
them
she
sat
down
by
the
casement
breathless
and
overcome
with
the
alternate
emotions
of
hope
and
fear
then
rose
again
leaned
from
the
window
that
she
might
catch
a
nearer
sound
listened
now
doubting
and
then
believing
softly
exclaimed
the
name
of
valancourt
and
then
sunk
again
into
the
chair
yes
it
was
possible
that
valancourt
was
near
her
and
she
recollected
circumstances
which
induced
her
to
believe
it
was
his
voice
she
had
just
heard
she
remembered
he
had
more
than
once
said
that
the
fishing-house
where
she
had
formerly
listened
to
this
voice
and
air
and
where
she
had
seen
pencilled
sonnets
addressed
to
herself
had
been
his
favourite
haunt
before
he
had
been
made
known
to
her
there
too
she
had
herself
unexpectedly
met
him
it
appeared
from
these
circumstances
more
than
probable
that
he
was
the
musician
who
had
formerly
charmed
her
attention
and
the
author
of
the
lines
which
had
expressed
such
tender
admirationâ€”who
else
indeed
could
it
be
she
was
unable
at
that
time
to
form
a
conjecture
as
to
the
writer
but
since
her
acquaintance
with
valancourt
whenever
he
had
mentioned
the
fishing-house
to
have
been
known
to
him
she
had
not
scrupled
to
believe
that
he
was
the
author
of
the
sonnets
as
these
considerations
passed
over
her
mind
joy
fear
and
tenderness
contended
at
her
heart
she
leaned
again
from
the
casement
to
catch
the
sounds
which
might
confirm
or
destroy
her
hope
though
she
did
not
recollect
to
have
ever
heard
him
sing
but
the
voice
and
the
instrument
now
ceased
she
considered
for
a
moment
whether
she
should
venture
to
speak
then
not
choosing
lest
it
should
be
he
to
mention
his
name
and
yet
too
much
interested
to
neglect
the
opportunity
of
enquiring
she
called
from
the
casement
â€œis
that
song
from
gasconyâ€
her
anxious
attention
was
not
cheered
by
any
reply
everything
remained
silent
her
impatience
increasing
with
her
fears
she
repeated
the
question
but
still
no
sound
was
heard
except
the
sighings
of
the
wind
among
the
battlements
above
and
she
endeavoured
to
console
herself
with
a
belief
that
the
stranger
whoever
he
was
had
retired
before
she
had
spoken
beyond
the
reach
of
her
voice
which
it
appeared
certain
had
valancourt
heard
and
recognised
he
would
instantly
have
replied
to
presently
however
she
considered
that
a
motive
of
prudence
and
not
an
accidental
removal
might
occasion
his
silence
but
the
surmise
that
led
to
this
reflection
suddenly
changed
her
hope
and
joy
to
terror
and
grief
for
if
valancourt
were
in
the
castle
it
was
too
probable
that
he
was
here
a
prisoner
taken
with
some
of
his
countrymen
many
of
whom
were
at
that
time
engaged
in
the
wars
of
italy
or
intercepted
in
some
attempt
to
reach
her
had
he
even
recollected
emilyâ€™s
voice
he
would
have
feared
in
these
circumstances
to
reply
to
it
in
the
presence
of
the
men
who
guarded
his
prison
what
so
lately
she
had
eagerly
hoped
she
now
believed
she
dreadedâ€”dreaded
to
know
that
valancourt
was
near
her
and
while
she
was
anxious
to
be
relieved
from
her
apprehension
for
his
safety
she
still
was
unconscious
that
a
hope
of
soon
seeing
him
struggled
with
the
fear
she
remained
listening
at
the
casement
till
the
air
began
to
freshen
and
one
high
mountain
in
the
east
to
glimmer
with
the
morning
when
wearied
with
anxiety
she
retired
to
her
couch
where
she
found
it
utterly
impossible
to
sleep
for
joy
tenderness
doubt
and
apprehension
distracted
her
during
the
whole
night
now
she
rose
from
the
couch
and
opened
the
casement
to
listen
then
she
would
pace
the
room
with
impatient
steps
and
at
length
return
with
despondence
to
her
pillow
never
did
hours
appear
to
move
so
heavily
as
those
of
this
anxious
night
after
which
she
hoped
that
annette
might
appear
and
conclude
her
present
state
of
torturing
suspense
might
we
but
hear
the
folded
flocks
pennâ€™d
in
their
wattled
cotes
or
sound
of
pastoral
reed
with
oaten
stops
or
whistle
from
the
lodge
or
village
cock
count
the
night
watches
to
his
feathery
dames
â€™twould
be
some
solace
yet
some
little
cheering
in
this
close
dungeon
of
innumerous
boughs
milton
in
the
morning
emily
was
relieved
from
her
fears
for
annette
who
came
at
an
early
hour
â€œhere
were
fine
doings
in
the
castle
last
night
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
she
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
roomâ€”â€œfine
doings
indeed
were
you
not
frightened
maâ€™amselle
at
not
seeing
meâ€
â€œi
was
alarmed
both
on
your
account
and
on
my
ownâ€
replied
emilyâ€”â€œwhat
detained
youâ€
â€œaye
i
said
so
i
told
him
so
but
it
would
not
do
it
was
not
my
fault
indeed
maâ€™amselle
for
i
could
not
get
out
that
rogue
ludovico
locked
me
up
againâ€
â€œlocked
you
upâ€
said
emily
with
displeasure
â€œwhy
do
you
permit
ludovico
to
lock
you
upâ€
â€œholy
saintsâ€
exclaimed
annette
â€œhow
can
i
help
it
if
he
will
lock
the
door
maâ€™amselle
and
take
away
the
key
how
am
i
to
get
out
unless
i
jump
through
the
window
but
that
i
should
not
mind
so
much
if
the
casements
here
were
not
all
so
high
one
can
hardly
scramble
up
to
them
on
the
inside
and
one
should
break
oneâ€™s
neck
i
suppose
going
down
on
the
outside
but
you
know
i
dare
say
maâ€™am
what
a
hurly-burly
the
castle
was
in
last
night
you
must
have
heard
some
of
the
uproarâ€
â€œwhat
were
they
disputing
thenâ€
said
emily
â€œno
maâ€™amselle
nor
fighting
but
almost
as
good
for
i
believe
there
was
not
one
of
the
signors
sober
and
what
is
more
not
one
of
those
fine
ladies
sober
either
i
thought
when
i
saw
them
first
that
all
those
fine
silks
and
fine
veilsâ€”why
maâ€™amselle
their
veils
were
worked
with
silver
and
fine
trimmingsâ€”boded
no
goodâ€”i
guessed
what
they
wereâ€
â€œgood
godâ€
exclaimed
emily
â€œwhat
will
become
of
meâ€
â€œaye
maâ€™am
ludovico
said
much
the
same
thing
of
me
â€˜good
godâ€™
said
he
â€˜annette
what
is
to
become
of
you
if
you
are
to
go
running
about
the
castle
among
all
these
drunken
signorsâ€™
â€œâ€˜oâ€™
says
i
â€˜for
that
matter
i
only
want
to
go
to
my
young
ladyâ€™s
chamber
and
i
have
only
to
go
you
know
along
the
vaulted
passage
and
across
the
great
hall
and
up
the
marble
staircase
and
along
the
north
gallery
and
through
the
west
wing
of
the
castle
and
i
am
in
the
corridor
in
a
minuteâ€™
â€˜are
you
soâ€™
says
he
â€˜and
what
is
to
become
of
you
if
you
meet
any
of
those
noble
cavaliers
in
the
wayâ€™
â€˜wellâ€™
says
i
â€˜if
you
think
there
is
danger
then
go
with
me
and
guard
me
i
am
never
afraid
when
you
are
byâ€™
â€˜whatâ€™
says
he
â€˜when
i
am
scarcely
recovered
of
one
wound
shall
i
put
myself
in
the
way
of
getting
another
for
if
any
of
the
cavaliers
meet
you
they
will
fall
a-fighting
with
me
directly
no
noâ€™
says
he
â€˜i
will
cut
the
way
shorter
than
through
the
vaulted
passage
and
up
the
marble
staircase
and
along
the
north
gallery
and
through
the
west
wing
of
the
castle
for
you
shall
stay
here
annette
you
shall
not
go
out
of
this
room
tonightâ€™
so
with
that
i
saysâ€”â€
â€œwell
wellâ€
said
emily
impatiently
and
anxious
to
enquire
on
another
subjectâ€”â€œso
he
locked
you
upâ€
â€œyes
he
did
indeed
maâ€™amselle
notwithstanding
all
i
could
say
to
the
contrary
and
caterina
and
i
and
he
staid
there
all
night
and
in
a
few
minutes
after
i
was
not
so
vexed
for
there
came
signor
verezzi
roaring
along
the
passage
like
a
mad
bull
and
he
mistook
ludovicoâ€™s
hall
for
old
carloâ€™s
so
he
tried
to
burst
open
the
door
and
called
out
for
more
wine
for
that
he
had
drunk
all
the
flasks
dry
and
was
dying
of
thirst
so
we
were
all
as
still
as
night
that
he
might
suppose
there
was
nobody
in
the
room
but
the
signor
was
as
cunning
as
the
best
of
us
and
kept
calling
out
at
the
door
â€˜come
forth
my
ancient
heroâ€™
said
he
â€˜here
is
no
enemy
at
the
gate
that
you
need
hide
yourself
come
forth
my
valorous
signor
stewardâ€™
just
then
old
carlo
opened
his
door
and
he
came
with
a
flask
in
his
hand
for
as
soon
as
the
signor
saw
him
he
was
as
tame
as
could
be
and
followed
him
away
as
naturally
as
a
dog
does
a
butcher
with
a
piece
of
meat
in
his
basket
all
this
i
saw
through
the
key-hole
â€˜well
annetteâ€™
said
ludovico
jeeringly
â€˜shall
i
let
you
out
nowâ€™
â€˜o
noâ€™
says
i
â€˜i
would
notâ€”â€™â€
â€œi
have
some
questions
to
ask
you
on
another
subjectâ€
interrupted
emily
quite
wearied
by
this
story
â€œdo
you
know
whether
there
are
any
prisoners
in
the
castle
and
whether
they
are
confined
at
this
end
of
the
edificeâ€
â€œi
was
not
in
the
way
maâ€™amselleâ€
replied
annette
â€œwhen
the
first
party
came
in
from
the
mountains
and
the
last
party
is
not
come
back
yet
so
i
donâ€™t
know
whether
there
are
any
prisoners
but
it
is
expected
back
tonight
or
tomorrow
and
i
shall
know
then
perhapsâ€
emily
enquired
if
she
had
ever
heard
the
servants
talk
of
prisoners
â€œah
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
archly
â€œnow
i
dare
say
you
are
thinking
of
monsieur
valancourt
and
that
he
may
have
come
among
the
armies
which
they
say
are
come
from
our
country
to
fight
against
this
state
and
that
he
has
met
with
some
of
our
people
and
is
taken
captive
o
lord
how
glad
i
should
be
if
it
was
soâ€
â€œwould
you
indeed
be
gladâ€
said
emily
in
a
tone
of
mournful
reproach
â€œto
be
sure
i
should
maâ€™amâ€
replied
annette
â€œand
would
not
you
be
glad
too
to
see
signor
valancourt
i
donâ€™t
know
any
chevalier
i
like
better
i
have
a
very
great
regard
for
the
signor
trulyâ€
â€œyour
regard
for
him
cannot
be
doubtedâ€
said
emily
â€œsince
you
wish
to
see
him
a
prisonerâ€
â€œwhy
no
maâ€™amselle
not
a
prisoner
either
but
one
must
be
glad
to
see
him
you
know
and
it
was
only
the
other
night
i
dreamtâ€”i
dreamt
i
saw
him
drive
into
the
castle-yard
all
in
a
coach
and
six
and
dressed
out
with
a
laced
coat
and
a
sword
like
a
lord
as
he
isâ€
emily
could
not
forbear
smiling
at
annetteâ€™s
ideas
of
valancourt
and
repeated
her
enquiry
whether
she
had
heard
the
servants
talk
of
prisoners
â€œno
maâ€™amselleâ€
replied
she
â€œnever
and
lately
they
have
done
nothing
but
talk
of
the
apparition
that
has
been
walking
about
of
a
night
on
the
ramparts
and
that
frightened
the
sentinels
into
fits
it
came
among
them
like
a
flash
of
fire
they
say
and
they
all
fell
down
in
a
row
till
they
came
to
themselves
again
and
then
it
was
gone
and
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
old
castle
walls
so
they
helped
one
another
up
again
as
fast
as
they
could
you
would
not
believe
maâ€™amselle
though
i
showed
you
the
very
cannon
where
it
used
to
appearâ€
â€œand
are
you
indeed
so
simple
annetteâ€
said
emily
smiling
at
this
curious
exaggeration
of
the
circumstances
she
had
witnessed
â€œas
to
credit
these
storiesâ€
â€œcredit
them
maâ€™amselle
why
all
the
world
could
not
persuade
me
out
of
them
roberto
and
sebastian
and
half
a
dozen
more
of
them
went
into
fits
to
be
sure
there
was
no
occasion
for
that
i
said
myself
there
was
no
need
of
that
for
says
i
when
the
enemy
comes
what
a
pretty
figure
they
will
cut
if
they
are
to
fall
down
in
fits
all
of
a
row
the
enemy
wonâ€™t
be
so
civil
perhaps
as
to
walk
off
like
the
ghost
and
leave
them
to
help
one
another
up
but
will
fall
to
cutting
and
slashing
till
he
makes
them
all
rise
up
dead
men
no
no
says
i
there
is
reason
in
all
things
though
i
might
have
fallen
down
in
a
fit
that
was
no
rule
for
them
being
because
it
is
no
business
of
mine
to
look
gruff
and
fight
battlesâ€
emily
endeavoured
to
correct
the
superstitious
weakness
of
annette
though
she
could
not
entirely
subdue
her
own
to
which
the
latter
only
replied
â€œnay
maâ€™amselle
you
will
believe
nothing
you
are
almost
as
bad
as
the
signor
himself
who
was
in
a
great
passion
when
they
told
of
what
had
happened
and
swore
that
the
first
man
who
repeated
such
nonsense
should
be
thrown
into
the
dungeon
under
the
east
turret
this
was
a
hard
punishment
too
for
only
talking
nonsense
as
he
called
it
but
i
dare
say
he
had
other
reasons
for
calling
it
so
than
you
have
maâ€™amâ€
emily
looked
displeased
and
made
no
reply
as
she
mused
upon
the
recollected
appearance
which
had
lately
so
much
alarmed
her
and
considered
the
circumstances
of
the
figure
having
stationed
itself
opposite
to
her
casement
she
was
for
a
moment
inclined
to
believe
it
was
valancourt
whom
she
had
seen
yet
if
it
was
he
why
did
he
not
speak
to
her
when
he
had
the
opportunity
of
doing
soâ€”and
if
he
was
a
prisoner
in
the
castle
and
he
could
be
here
in
no
other
character
how
could
he
obtain
the
means
of
walking
abroad
on
the
rampart
thus
she
was
utterly
unable
to
decide
whether
the
musician
and
the
form
she
had
observed
were
the
same
or
if
they
were
whether
this
was
valancourt
she
however
desired
that
annette
would
endeavour
to
learn
whether
any
prisoners
were
in
the
castle
and
also
their
names
â€œo
dear
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œi
forget
to
tell
you
what
you
bade
me
ask
about
the
ladies
as
they
call
themselves
who
are
lately
come
to
udolpho
why
that
signora
livona
that
the
signor
brought
to
see
my
late
lady
at
venice
is
his
mistress
now
and
was
little
better
then
i
dare
say
and
ludovico
says
but
pray
be
secret
maâ€™am
that
his
excellenza
introduced
her
only
to
impose
upon
the
world
that
had
begun
to
make
free
with
her
character
so
when
people
saw
my
lady
notice
her
they
thought
what
they
had
heard
must
be
scandal
the
other
two
are
the
mistresses
of
signor
verezzi
and
signor
bertolini
and
signor
montoni
invited
them
all
to
the
castle
and
so
yesterday
he
gave
a
great
entertainment
and
there
they
were
all
drinking
tuscany
wine
and
all
sorts
and
laughing
and
singing
till
they
made
the
castle
ring
again
but
i
thought
they
were
dismal
sounds
so
soon
after
my
poor
ladyâ€™s
death
too
and
they
brought
to
my
mind
what
she
would
have
thought
if
she
had
heard
themâ€”but
she
cannot
hear
them
now
poor
soul
said
iâ€
emily
turned
away
to
conceal
her
emotion
and
then
desired
annette
to
go
and
make
enquiry
concerning
the
prisoners
that
might
be
in
the
castle
but
conjured
her
to
do
it
with
caution
and
on
no
account
to
mention
her
name
or
that
of
monsieur
valancourt
â€œnow
i
think
of
it
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œi
do
believe
there
are
prisoners
for
i
overheard
one
of
the
signorâ€™s
men
yesterday
in
the
servants
hall
talking
something
about
ransoms
and
saying
what
a
fine
thing
it
was
for
his
excellenza
to
catch
up
men
and
they
were
as
good
booty
as
any
other
because
of
the
ransoms
and
the
other
man
was
grumbling
and
saying
it
was
fine
enough
for
the
signor
but
none
so
fine
for
his
soldiers
because
said
he
we
donâ€™t
go
shares
thereâ€
this
information
heightened
emilyâ€™s
impatience
to
know
more
and
annette
immediately
departed
on
her
enquiry
the
late
resolution
of
emily
to
resign
her
estates
to
montoni
now
gave
way
to
new
considerations
the
possibility
that
valancourt
was
near
her
revived
her
fortitude
and
she
determined
to
brave
the
threatened
vengeance
at
least
till
she
could
be
assured
whether
he
was
really
in
the
castle
she
was
in
this
temper
of
mind
when
she
received
a
message
from
montoni
requiring
her
attendance
in
the
cedar
parlour
which
she
obeyed
with
trembling
and
on
her
way
thither
endeavoured
to
animate
her
fortitude
with
the
idea
of
valancourt
montoni
was
alone
â€œi
sent
for
youâ€
said
he
â€œto
give
you
another
opportunity
of
retracting
your
late
mistaken
assertions
concerning
the
languedoc
estates
i
will
condescend
to
advise
where
i
may
commandâ€”if
you
are
really
deluded
by
an
opinion
that
you
have
any
right
to
these
estates
at
least
do
not
persist
in
the
errorâ€”an
error
which
you
may
perceive
too
late
has
been
fatal
to
you
dare
my
resentment
no
further
but
sign
the
papersâ€
â€œif
i
have
no
right
in
these
estates
sirâ€
said
emily
â€œof
what
service
can
it
be
to
you
that
i
should
sign
any
papers
concerning
them
if
the
lands
are
yours
by
law
you
certainly
may
possess
them
without
my
interference
or
my
consentâ€
â€œi
will
have
no
more
argumentâ€
said
montoni
with
a
look
that
made
her
tremble
â€œwhat
had
i
but
trouble
to
expect
when
i
condescended
to
reason
with
a
baby
but
i
will
be
trifled
with
no
longer
let
the
recollection
of
your
auntâ€™s
sufferings
in
consequence
of
her
folly
and
obstinacy
teach
you
a
lessonâ€”sign
the
papersâ€
emilyâ€™s
resolution
was
for
a
moment
awedâ€”she
shrunk
at
the
recollections
he
revived
and
from
the
vengeance
he
threatened
but
then
the
image
of
valancourt
who
so
long
had
loved
her
and
who
was
now
perhaps
so
near
her
came
to
her
heart
and
together
with
the
strong
feelings
of
indignation
with
which
she
had
always
from
her
infancy
regarded
an
act
of
injustice
inspired
her
with
a
noble
though
imprudent
courage
â€œsign
the
papersâ€
said
montoni
more
impatiently
than
before
â€œnever
sirâ€
replied
emily
â€œthat
request
would
have
proved
to
me
the
injustice
of
your
claim
had
i
even
been
ignorant
of
my
rightâ€
montoni
turned
pale
with
anger
while
his
quivering
lip
and
lurking
eye
made
her
almost
repent
the
boldness
of
her
speech
â€œthen
all
my
vengeance
falls
upon
youâ€
he
exclaimed
with
a
horrible
oath
â€œand
think
not
it
shall
be
delayed
neither
the
estates
in
languedoc
nor
gascony
shall
be
yours
you
have
dared
to
question
my
rightâ€”now
dare
to
question
my
power
i
have
a
punishment
which
you
think
not
of
it
is
terrible
this
nightâ€”this
very
nightâ€”â€
â€œthis
nightâ€
repeated
another
voice
montoni
paused
and
turned
half
round
but
seeming
to
recollect
himself
he
proceeded
in
a
lower
tone
â€œyou
have
lately
seen
one
terrible
example
of
obstinacy
and
folly
yet
this
it
appears
has
not
been
sufficient
to
deter
youâ€”i
could
tell
you
of
othersâ€”i
could
make
you
tremble
at
the
bare
recitalâ€
he
was
interrupted
by
a
groan
which
seemed
to
rise
from
underneath
the
chamber
they
were
in
and
as
he
threw
a
glance
round
it
impatience
and
rage
flashed
from
his
eyes
yet
something
like
a
shade
of
fear
passed
over
his
countenance
emily
sat
down
in
a
chair
near
the
door
for
the
various
emotions
she
had
suffered
now
almost
overcame
her
but
montoni
paused
scarcely
an
instant
and
commanding
his
features
resumed
his
discourse
in
a
lower
yet
sterner
voice
â€œi
say
i
could
give
you
other
instances
of
my
power
and
of
my
character
which
it
seems
you
do
not
understand
or
you
would
not
defy
meâ€”i
could
tell
you
that
when
once
my
resolution
is
takenâ€”but
i
am
talking
to
a
baby
let
me
however
repeat
that
terrible
as
are
the
examples
i
could
recite
the
recital
could
not
now
benefit
you
for
though
your
repentance
would
put
an
immediate
end
to
opposition
it
would
not
now
appease
my
indignationâ€”i
will
have
vengeance
as
well
as
justiceâ€
another
groan
filled
the
pause
which
montoni
made
â€œleave
the
room
instantlyâ€
said
he
seeming
not
to
notice
this
strange
occurrence
without
power
to
implore
his
pity
she
rose
to
go
but
found
that
she
could
not
support
herself
awe
and
terror
overcame
her
and
she
sunk
again
into
the
chair
â€œquit
my
presenceâ€
cried
montoni
â€œthis
affectation
of
fear
ill
becomes
the
heroine
who
has
just
dared
to
brave
my
indignationâ€
â€œdid
you
hear
nothing
signorâ€
said
emily
trembling
and
still
unable
to
leave
the
room
â€œi
heard
my
own
voiceâ€
rejoined
montoni
sternly
â€œand
nothing
elseâ€
said
emily
speaking
with
difficultyâ€”â€œthere
again
do
you
hear
nothing
nowâ€
â€œobey
my
orderâ€
repeated
montoni
â€œand
for
these
foolâ€™s
tricksâ€”i
will
soon
discover
by
whom
they
are
practisedâ€
emily
again
rose
and
exerted
herself
to
the
utmost
to
leave
the
room
while
montoni
followed
her
but
instead
of
calling
aloud
to
his
servants
to
search
the
chamber
as
he
had
formerly
done
on
a
similar
occurrence
passed
to
the
ramparts
as
in
her
way
to
the
corridor
she
rested
for
a
moment
at
an
open
casement
emily
saw
a
party
of
montoniâ€™s
troops
winding
down
a
distant
mountain
whom
she
noticed
no
further
than
as
they
brought
to
her
mind
the
wretched
prisoners
they
were
perhaps
bringing
to
the
castle
at
length
having
reached
her
apartment
she
threw
herself
upon
the
couch
overcome
with
the
new
horrors
of
her
situation
her
thoughts
lost
in
tumult
and
perplexity
she
could
neither
repent
of
nor
approve
her
late
conduct
she
could
only
remember
that
she
was
in
the
power
of
a
man
who
had
no
principle
of
actionâ€”but
his
will
and
the
astonishment
and
terrors
of
superstition
which
had
for
a
moment
so
strongly
assailed
her
now
yielded
to
those
of
reason
she
was
at
length
roused
from
the
reverie
which
engaged
her
by
a
confusion
of
distant
voices
and
a
clattering
of
hoofs
that
seemed
to
come
on
the
wind
from
the
courts
a
sudden
hope
that
some
good
was
approaching
seized
her
mind
till
she
remembered
the
troops
she
had
observed
from
the
casement
and
concluded
this
to
be
the
party
which
annette
had
said
were
expected
at
udolpho
soon
after
she
heard
voices
faintly
from
the
halls
and
the
noise
of
horsesâ€™
feet
sunk
away
in
the
wind
silence
ensued
emily
listened
anxiously
for
annetteâ€™s
step
in
the
corridor
but
a
pause
of
total
stillness
continued
till
again
the
castle
seemed
to
be
all
tumult
and
confusion
she
heard
the
echoes
of
many
footsteps
passing
to
and
fro
in
the
halls
and
avenues
below
and
then
busy
tongues
were
loud
on
the
rampart
having
hurried
to
her
casement
she
perceived
montoni
with
some
of
his
officers
leaning
on
the
walls
and
pointing
from
them
while
several
soldiers
were
employed
at
the
further
end
of
the
rampart
about
some
cannon
and
she
continued
to
observe
them
careless
of
the
passing
time
annette
at
length
appeared
but
brought
no
intelligence
of
valancourt
â€œfor
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
she
â€œall
the
people
pretend
to
know
nothing
about
any
prisoners
but
here
is
a
fine
piece
of
business
the
rest
of
the
party
are
just
arrived
maâ€™am
they
came
scampering
in
as
if
they
would
have
broken
their
necks
one
scarcely
knew
whether
the
man
or
his
horse
would
get
within
the
gates
first
and
they
have
brought
wordâ€”and
such
news
they
have
brought
word
that
a
party
of
the
enemy
as
they
call
them
are
coming
towards
the
castle
so
we
shall
have
all
the
officers
of
justice
i
suppose
besieging
it
all
those
terrible-looking
fellows
one
used
to
see
at
veniceâ€
â€œthank
godâ€
exclaimed
emily
fervently
â€œthere
is
yet
a
hope
left
for
me
thenâ€
â€œwhat
mean
you
maâ€™amselle
do
you
wish
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
those
sad-looking
men
why
i
used
to
shudder
as
i
passed
them
and
should
have
guessed
what
they
were
if
ludovico
had
not
told
meâ€
â€œwe
cannot
be
in
worse
hands
than
at
presentâ€
replied
emily
unguardedly
â€œbut
what
reason
have
you
to
suppose
these
are
officers
of
justiceâ€
â€œwhy
our
people
maâ€™am
are
all
in
such
a
fright
and
a
fuss
and
i
donâ€™t
know
anything
but
the
fear
of
justice
that
could
make
them
so
i
used
to
think
nothing
on
earth
could
fluster
them
unless
indeed
it
was
a
ghost
or
so
but
now
some
of
them
are
for
hiding
down
in
the
vaults
under
the
castle
but
you
must
not
tell
the
signor
this
maâ€™amselle
and
i
overheard
two
of
them
talkingâ€”holy
mother
what
makes
you
look
so
sad
maâ€™amselle
you
donâ€™t
hear
what
i
sayâ€
â€œyes
i
do
annette
pray
proceedâ€
â€œwell
maâ€™amselle
all
the
castle
is
in
such
hurly-burly
some
of
the
men
are
loading
the
cannon
and
some
are
examining
the
great
gates
and
the
walls
all
round
and
are
hammering
and
patching
up
just
as
if
all
those
repairs
had
never
been
made
that
were
so
long
about
but
what
is
to
become
of
me
and
you
maâ€™amselle
and
ludovico
o
when
i
hear
the
sound
of
the
cannon
i
shall
die
with
fright
if
i
could
but
catch
the
great
gate
open
for
one
minute
i
would
be
even
with
it
for
shutting
me
within
these
walls
so
longâ€”it
should
never
see
me
againâ€
emily
caught
the
latter
words
of
annette
â€œo
if
you
could
find
it
open
but
for
one
momentâ€
she
exclaimed
â€œmy
peace
might
yet
be
savedâ€
the
heavy
groan
she
uttered
and
the
wildness
of
her
look
terrified
annette
still
more
than
her
words
who
entreated
emily
to
explain
the
meaning
of
them
to
whom
it
suddenly
occurred
that
ludovico
might
be
of
some
service
if
there
should
be
a
possibility
of
escape
and
who
repeated
the
substance
of
what
had
passed
between
montoni
and
herself
but
conjured
her
to
mention
this
to
no
person
except
to
ludovico
â€œit
may
perhaps
be
in
his
powerâ€
she
added
â€œto
effect
our
escape
go
to
him
annette
tell
him
what
i
have
to
apprehend
and
what
i
have
already
suffered
but
entreat
him
to
be
secret
and
to
lose
no
time
in
attempting
to
release
us
if
he
is
willing
to
undertake
this
he
shall
be
amply
rewarded
i
cannot
speak
with
him
myself
for
we
might
be
observed
and
then
effectual
care
would
be
taken
to
prevent
our
flight
but
be
quick
annette
and
above
all
be
discreetâ€”i
will
await
your
return
in
this
apartmentâ€
the
girl
whose
honest
heart
had
been
much
affected
by
the
recital
was
now
as
eager
to
obey
as
emily
was
to
employ
her
and
she
immediately
quitted
the
room
emilyâ€™s
surprise
increased
as
she
reflected
upon
annetteâ€™s
intelligence
â€œalasâ€
said
she
â€œwhat
can
the
officers
of
justice
do
against
an
armed
castle
these
cannot
be
suchâ€
upon
further
consideration
however
she
concluded
that
montoniâ€™s
bands
having
plundered
the
country
round
the
inhabitants
had
taken
arms
and
were
coming
with
the
officers
of
police
and
a
party
of
soldiers
to
force
their
way
into
the
castle
â€œbut
they
know
notâ€
thought
she
â€œits
strength
or
the
armed
numbers
within
it
alas
except
from
flight
i
have
nothing
to
hopeâ€
montoni
though
not
precisely
what
emily
apprehended
him
to
beâ€”a
captain
of
bandittiâ€”had
employed
his
troops
in
enterprises
not
less
daring
or
less
atrocious
than
such
a
character
would
have
undertaken
they
had
not
only
pillaged
whenever
opportunity
offered
the
helpless
traveller
but
had
attacked
and
plundered
the
villas
of
several
persons
which
being
situated
among
the
solitary
recesses
of
the
mountains
were
totally
unprepared
for
resistance
in
these
expeditions
the
commanders
of
the
party
did
not
appear
and
the
men
partly
disguised
had
sometimes
been
mistaken
for
common
robbers
and
at
others
for
bands
of
the
foreign
enemy
who
at
that
period
invaded
the
country
but
though
they
had
already
pillaged
several
mansions
and
brought
home
considerable
treasures
they
had
ventured
to
approach
only
one
castle
in
the
attack
of
which
they
were
assisted
by
other
troops
of
their
own
order
from
this
however
they
were
vigorously
repulsed
and
pursued
by
some
of
the
foreign
enemy
who
were
in
league
with
the
besieged
montoniâ€™s
troops
fled
precipitately
towards
udolpho
but
were
so
closely
tracked
over
the
mountains
that
when
they
reached
one
of
the
heights
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
castle
and
looked
back
upon
the
road
they
perceived
the
enemy
winding
among
the
cliffs
below
and
at
not
more
than
a
league
distant
upon
this
discovery
they
hastened
forward
with
increased
speed
to
prepare
montoni
for
the
enemy
and
it
was
their
arrival
which
had
thrown
the
castle
into
such
confusion
and
tumult
as
emily
awaited
anxiously
some
information
from
below
she
now
saw
from
her
casements
a
body
of
troops
pour
over
the
neighbouring
heights
and
though
annette
had
been
gone
a
very
short
time
and
had
a
difficult
and
dangerous
business
to
accomplish
her
impatience
for
intelligence
became
painful
she
listened
opened
her
door
and
often
went
out
upon
the
corridor
to
meet
her
at
length
she
heard
a
footstep
approach
her
chamber
and
on
opening
the
door
saw
not
annette
but
old
carlo
new
fears
rushed
upon
her
mind
he
said
he
came
from
the
signor
who
had
ordered
him
to
inform
her
that
she
must
be
ready
to
depart
from
udolpho
immediately
for
that
the
castle
was
about
to
be
besieged
and
that
mules
were
preparing
to
convey
her
with
her
guides
to
a
place
of
safety
â€œof
safetyâ€
exclaimed
emily
thoughtlessly
â€œhas
then
the
signor
so
much
consideration
for
meâ€
carlo
looked
upon
the
ground
and
made
no
reply
a
thousand
opposite
emotions
agitated
emily
successively
as
she
listened
to
old
carlo
those
of
joy
grief
distrust
and
apprehension
appeared
and
vanished
from
her
mind
with
the
quickness
of
lightning
one
moment
it
seemed
impossible
that
montoni
could
take
this
measure
merely
for
her
preservation
and
so
very
strange
was
his
sending
her
from
the
castle
at
all
that
she
could
attribute
it
only
to
the
design
of
carrying
into
execution
the
new
scheme
of
vengeance
with
which
he
had
menaced
her
in
the
next
instant
it
appeared
so
desirable
to
quit
the
castle
under
any
circumstances
that
she
could
not
but
rejoice
in
the
prospect
believing
that
change
must
be
for
the
better
till
she
remembered
the
probability
of
valancourt
being
detained
in
it
when
sorrow
and
regret
usurped
her
mind
and
she
wished
much
more
fervently
than
she
had
yet
done
that
it
might
not
be
his
voice
which
she
had
heard
carlo
having
reminded
her
that
she
had
no
time
to
lose
for
that
the
enemy
were
within
sight
of
the
castle
emily
entreated
him
to
inform
her
whither
she
was
to
go
and
after
some
hesitation
he
said
he
had
received
no
orders
to
tell
but
on
her
repeating
the
question
replied
that
he
believed
she
was
to
be
carried
into
tuscany
â€œto
tuscanyâ€
exclaimed
emilyâ€”â€œand
why
thitherâ€
carlo
answered
that
he
knew
nothing
further
than
that
she
was
to
be
lodged
in
a
cottage
on
the
borders
of
tuscany
at
the
feet
of
the
apenninesâ€”â€œnot
a
dayâ€™s
journey
distantâ€
said
he
emily
now
dismissed
him
and
with
trembling
hands
prepared
the
small
package
that
she
meant
to
take
with
her
while
she
was
employed
about
which
annette
returned
â€œo
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
she
â€œnothing
can
be
done
ludovico
says
the
new
porter
is
more
watchful
even
than
barnardine
was
and
we
might
as
well
throw
ourselves
in
the
way
of
a
dragon
as
in
his
ludovico
is
almost
as
broken-hearted
as
you
are
maâ€™am
on
my
account
he
says
and
i
am
sure
i
shall
never
live
to
hear
the
cannon
fire
twiceâ€
she
now
began
to
weep
but
revived
upon
hearing
of
what
had
just
occurred
and
entreated
emily
to
take
her
with
her
â€œthat
i
will
do
most
willinglyâ€
replied
emily
â€œif
signor
montoni
permits
itâ€
to
which
annette
made
no
reply
but
ran
out
of
the
room
and
immediately
sought
montoni
who
was
on
the
terrace
surrounded
by
his
officers
where
she
began
her
petition
he
sharply
bade
her
go
into
the
castle
and
absolutely
refused
her
request
annette
however
not
only
pleaded
for
herself
but
for
ludovico
and
montoni
had
ordered
some
of
his
men
to
take
her
from
his
presence
before
she
would
retire
in
an
agony
of
disappointment
she
returned
to
emily
who
foreboded
little
good
towards
herself
from
this
refusal
to
annette
and
who
soon
after
received
a
summons
to
repair
to
the
great
court
where
the
mules
with
her
guides
were
in
waiting
emily
here
tried
in
vain
to
sooth
the
weeping
annette
who
persisted
in
saying
that
she
should
never
see
her
dear
young
lady
again
a
fear
which
her
mistress
secretly
thought
too
well
justified
but
which
she
endeavoured
to
restrain
while
with
apparent
composure
she
bade
this
affectionate
servant
farewell
annette
however
followed
to
the
courts
which
were
now
thronged
with
people
busy
in
preparation
for
the
enemy
and
having
seen
her
mount
her
mule
and
depart
with
her
attendants
through
the
portal
turned
into
the
castle
and
wept
again
emily
meanwhile
as
she
looked
back
upon
the
gloomy
courts
of
the
castle
no
longer
silent
as
when
she
had
first
entered
them
but
resounding
with
the
noise
of
preparation
for
their
defence
as
well
as
crowded
with
soldiers
and
workmen
hurrying
to
and
fro
and
when
she
passed
once
more
under
the
huge
portcullis
which
had
formerly
struck
her
with
terror
and
dismay
and
looking
round
saw
no
walls
to
confine
her
stepsâ€”felt
in
spite
of
anticipation
the
sudden
joy
of
a
prisoner
who
unexpectedly
finds
himself
at
liberty
this
emotion
would
not
suffer
her
now
to
look
impartially
on
the
dangers
that
awaited
her
without
on
mountains
infested
by
hostile
parties
who
seized
every
opportunity
for
plunder
and
on
a
journey
commended
under
the
guidance
of
men
whose
countenances
certainly
did
not
speak
favourably
of
their
dispositions
in
the
present
moments
she
could
only
rejoice
that
she
was
liberated
from
those
walls
which
she
had
entered
with
such
dismal
forebodings
and
remembering
the
superstitious
presentiment
which
had
then
seized
her
she
could
now
smile
at
the
impression
it
had
made
upon
her
mind
as
she
gazed
with
these
emotions
upon
the
turrets
of
the
castle
rising
high
over
the
woods
among
which
she
wound
the
stranger
whom
she
believed
to
be
confined
there
returned
to
her
remembrance
and
anxiety
and
apprehension
lest
he
should
be
valancourt
again
passed
like
a
cloud
upon
her
joy
she
recollected
every
circumstance
concerning
this
unknown
person
since
the
night
when
she
had
first
heard
him
play
the
song
of
her
native
provinceâ€”circumstances
which
she
had
so
often
recollected
and
compared
before
without
extracting
from
them
anything
like
conviction
and
which
still
only
prompted
her
to
believe
that
valancourt
was
a
prisoner
at
udolpho
it
was
possible
however
that
the
men
who
were
her
conductors
might
afford
her
information
on
this
subject
but
fearing
to
question
them
immediately
lest
they
should
be
unwilling
to
discover
any
circumstance
to
her
in
the
presence
of
each
other
she
watched
for
an
opportunity
of
speaking
with
them
separately
soon
after
a
trumpet
echoed
faintly
from
a
distance
the
guides
stopped
and
looked
toward
the
quarter
whence
it
came
but
the
thick
woods
which
surrounded
them
excluding
all
view
of
the
country
beyond
one
of
the
men
rode
on
to
the
point
of
an
eminence
that
afforded
a
more
extensive
prospect
to
observe
how
near
the
enemy
whose
trumpet
he
guessed
this
to
be
were
advanced
the
other
meanwhile
remained
with
emily
and
to
him
she
put
some
questions
concerning
the
stranger
at
udolpho
ugo
for
this
was
his
name
said
that
there
were
several
prisoners
in
the
castle
but
he
neither
recollected
their
persons
nor
the
precise
time
of
their
arrival
and
could
therefore
give
her
no
information
there
was
a
surliness
in
his
manner
as
he
spoke
that
made
it
probable
he
would
not
have
satisfied
her
enquiries
even
if
he
could
have
done
so
having
asked
him
what
prisoners
had
been
taken
about
the
time
as
nearly
as
she
could
remember
when
she
had
first
heard
the
music
â€œall
that
weekâ€
said
ugo
â€œi
was
out
with
a
party
upon
the
mountains
and
knew
nothing
of
what
was
doing
at
the
castle
we
had
enough
upon
our
hands
we
had
warm
work
of
itâ€
bertrand
the
other
man
being
now
returned
emily
enquired
no
further
and
when
he
had
related
to
his
companion
what
he
had
seen
they
travelled
on
in
deep
silence
while
emily
often
caught
between
the
opening
woods
partial
glimpses
of
the
castle
aboveâ€”the
west
towers
whose
battlements
were
now
crowded
with
archers
and
the
ramparts
below
where
soldiers
were
seen
hurrying
along
or
busy
upon
the
walls
preparing
the
cannon
having
emerged
from
the
woods
they
wound
along
the
valley
in
an
opposite
direction
to
that
from
whence
the
enemy
were
approaching
emily
now
had
a
full
view
of
udolpho
with
its
grey
walls
towers
and
terraces
high
over-topping
the
precipices
and
the
dark
woods
and
glittering
partially
with
the
arms
of
the
condottieri
as
the
sunâ€™s
rays
streaming
through
an
autumnal
cloud
glanced
upon
a
part
of
the
edifice
whose
remaining
features
stood
in
darkened
majesty
she
continued
to
gaze
through
her
tears
upon
walls
that
perhaps
confined
valancourt
and
which
now
as
the
cloud
floated
away
were
lighted
up
with
sudden
splendour
and
then
as
suddenly
were
shrouded
in
gloom
while
the
passing
gleam
fell
on
the
wood-tops
below
and
heightened
the
first
tints
of
autumn
that
had
begun
to
steal
upon
the
foliage
the
winding
mountains
at
length
shut
udolpho
from
her
view
and
she
turned
with
mournful
reluctance
to
other
objects
the
melancholy
sighing
of
the
wind
among
the
pines
that
waved
high
over
the
steeps
and
the
distant
thunder
of
a
torrent
assisted
her
musings
and
conspired
with
the
wild
scenery
around
to
diffuse
over
her
mind
emotions
solemn
yet
not
unpleasing
but
which
were
soon
interrupted
by
the
distant
roar
of
cannon
echoing
among
the
mountains
the
sounds
rolled
along
the
wind
and
were
repeated
in
faint
and
fainter
reverberation
till
they
sunk
in
sullen
murmurs
this
was
a
signal
that
the
enemy
had
reached
the
castle
and
fear
for
valancourt
again
tormented
emily
she
turned
her
anxious
eyes
towards
that
part
of
the
country
where
the
edifice
stood
but
the
intervening
heights
concealed
it
from
her
view
still
however
she
saw
the
tall
head
of
a
mountain
which
immediately
fronted
her
late
chamber
and
on
this
she
fixed
her
gaze
as
if
it
could
have
told
her
of
all
that
was
passing
in
the
scene
it
overlooked
the
guides
twice
reminded
her
that
she
was
losing
time
and
that
they
had
far
to
go
before
she
could
turn
from
this
interesting
object
and
even
when
she
again
moved
onward
she
often
sent
a
look
back
till
only
its
blue
point
brightening
in
a
gleam
of
sunshine
appeared
peeping
over
other
mountains
the
sound
of
the
cannon
affected
ugo
as
the
blast
of
the
trumpet
does
the
war-horse
it
called
forth
all
the
fire
of
his
nature
he
was
impatient
to
be
in
the
midst
of
the
fight
and
uttered
frequent
execrations
against
montoni
for
having
sent
him
to
a
distance
the
feelings
of
his
comrade
seemed
to
be
very
opposite
and
adapted
rather
to
the
cruelties
than
to
the
dangers
of
war
emily
asked
frequent
questions
concerning
the
place
of
her
destination
but
could
only
learn
that
she
was
going
to
a
cottage
in
tuscany
and
whenever
she
mentioned
the
subject
she
fancied
she
perceived
in
the
countenances
of
these
men
an
expression
of
malice
and
cunning
that
alarmed
her
it
was
afternoon
when
they
had
left
the
castle
during
several
hours
they
travelled
through
regions
of
profound
solitude
where
no
bleat
of
sheep
or
bark
of
watch-dog
broke
on
silence
and
they
were
now
too
far
off
to
hear
even
the
faint
thunder
of
the
cannon
towards
evening
they
wound
down
precipices
black
with
forests
of
cypress
pine
and
cedar
into
a
glen
so
savage
and
secluded
that
if
solitude
ever
had
local
habitation
this
might
have
been
â€œher
place
of
dearest
residenceâ€
to
emily
it
appeared
a
spot
exactly
suited
for
the
retreat
of
banditti
and
in
her
imagination
she
already
saw
them
lurking
under
the
brow
of
some
projecting
rock
whence
their
shadows
lengthened
by
the
setting
sun
stretched
across
the
road
and
warned
the
traveller
of
his
danger
she
shuddered
at
the
idea
and
looking
at
her
conductors
to
observe
whether
they
were
armed
thought
she
saw
in
them
the
banditti
she
dreaded
it
was
in
this
glen
that
they
proposed
to
alight
â€œforâ€
said
ugo
â€œnight
will
come
on
presently
and
then
the
wolves
will
make
it
dangerous
to
stopâ€
this
was
a
new
subject
of
alarm
to
emily
but
inferior
to
what
she
suffered
from
the
thought
of
being
left
in
these
wilds
at
midnight
with
two
such
men
as
her
present
conductors
dark
and
dreadful
hints
of
what
might
be
montoniâ€™s
purpose
in
sending
her
hither
came
to
her
mind
she
endeavoured
to
dissuade
the
men
from
stopping
and
enquired
with
anxiety
how
far
they
had
yet
to
go
â€œmany
leagues
yetâ€
replied
bertrand
â€œas
for
you
signora
you
may
do
as
you
please
about
eating
but
for
us
we
will
make
a
hearty
supper
while
we
can
we
shall
have
need
of
it
i
warrant
before
we
finish
our
journey
the
sunâ€™s
going
down
apace
let
us
alight
under
that
rock
yonderâ€
his
comrade
assented
and
turning
the
mules
out
of
the
road
they
advanced
towards
a
cliff
overhung
with
cedars
emily
following
in
trembling
silence
they
lifted
her
from
her
mule
and
having
seated
themselves
on
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
drew
some
homely
fare
from
a
wallet
of
which
emily
tried
to
eat
a
little
the
better
to
disguise
her
apprehensions
the
sun
was
now
sunk
behind
the
high
mountains
in
the
west
upon
which
a
purple
haze
began
to
spread
and
the
gloom
of
twilight
to
draw
over
the
surrounding
objects
to
the
low
and
sullen
murmur
of
the
breeze
passing
among
the
woods
she
no
longer
listened
with
any
degree
of
pleasure
for
it
conspired
with
the
wildness
of
the
scene
and
the
evening
hour
to
depress
her
spirits
suspense
had
so
much
increased
her
anxiety
as
to
the
prisoner
at
udolpho
that
finding
it
impracticable
to
speak
alone
with
bertrand
on
that
subject
she
renewed
her
questions
in
the
presence
of
ugo
but
he
either
was
or
pretended
to
be
entirely
ignorant
concerning
the
stranger
when
he
had
dismissed
the
question
he
talked
with
ugo
on
some
subject
which
led
to
the
mention
of
signor
orsino
and
of
the
affair
that
had
banished
him
from
venice
respecting
which
emily
had
ventured
to
ask
a
few
questions
ugo
appeared
to
be
well
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
of
that
tragical
event
and
related
some
minute
particulars
that
both
shocked
and
surprised
her
for
it
appeared
very
extraordinary
how
such
particulars
could
be
known
to
any
but
to
persons
present
when
the
assassination
was
committed
â€œhe
was
of
rankâ€
said
bertrand
â€œor
the
state
would
not
have
troubled
itself
to
enquire
after
his
assassins
the
signor
has
been
lucky
hitherto
this
is
not
the
first
affair
of
the
kind
he
has
had
upon
his
hands
and
to
be
sure
when
a
gentleman
has
no
other
way
of
getting
redressâ€”why
he
must
take
thisâ€
â€œayeâ€
said
ugo
â€œand
why
is
not
this
as
good
as
another
this
is
the
way
to
have
justice
done
at
once
without
more
ado
if
you
go
to
law
you
must
stay
till
the
judges
please
and
may
lose
your
cause
at
last
why
the
best
way
then
is
to
make
sure
of
your
right
while
you
can
and
execute
justice
yourselfâ€
â€œyes
yesâ€
rejoined
bertrand
â€œif
you
wait
till
justice
is
done
youâ€”you
may
stay
long
enough
why
if
i
want
a
friend
of
mine
properly
served
how
am
i
to
get
my
revenge
ten
to
one
they
will
tell
me
he
is
in
the
right
and
i
am
in
the
wrong
or
if
a
fellow
has
got
possession
of
property
which
i
think
ought
to
be
mine
why
i
may
wait
till
i
starve
perhaps
before
the
law
will
give
it
me
and
then
after
all
the
judge
may
sayâ€”the
estate
is
his
what
is
to
be
done
thenâ€”why
the
case
is
plain
enough
i
must
take
it
at
lastâ€
emilyâ€™s
horror
at
this
conversation
was
heightened
by
a
suspicion
that
the
latter
part
of
it
was
pointed
against
herself
and
that
these
men
had
been
commissioned
by
montoni
to
execute
a
similar
kind
of
justice
in
his
cause
â€œbut
i
was
speaking
of
signor
orsinoâ€
resumed
bertrand
â€œhe
is
one
of
those
who
love
to
do
justice
at
once
i
remember
about
ten
years
ago
the
signor
had
a
quarrel
with
a
cavaliero
of
milan
the
story
was
told
me
then
and
it
is
still
fresh
in
my
head
they
quarrelled
about
a
lady
that
the
signor
liked
and
she
was
perverse
enough
to
prefer
the
gentleman
of
milan
and
even
carried
her
whim
so
far
as
to
marry
him
this
provoked
the
signor
as
well
it
might
for
he
had
tried
to
talk
reason
to
her
a
long
while
and
used
to
send
people
to
serenade
her
under
her
windows
of
a
night
and
used
to
make
verses
about
her
and
would
swear
she
was
the
handsomest
lady
in
milanâ€”but
all
would
not
doâ€”nothing
would
bring
her
to
reason
and
as
i
said
she
went
so
far
at
last
as
to
marry
this
other
cavaliero
this
made
the
signor
wrath
with
a
vengeance
he
resolved
to
be
even
with
her
though
and
he
watched
his
opportunity
and
did
not
wait
long
for
soon
after
the
marriage
they
set
out
for
padua
nothing
doubting
i
warrant
of
what
was
preparing
for
them
the
cavaliero
thought
to
be
sure
he
was
to
be
called
to
no
account
but
was
to
go
off
triumphant
but
he
was
soon
made
to
know
another
sort
of
storyâ€
â€œwhat
then
the
lady
had
promised
to
have
signor
orsinoâ€
said
ugo
â€œpromised
noâ€
replied
bertrand
â€œshe
had
not
wit
enough
even
to
tell
him
she
liked
him
as
i
heard
but
the
contrary
for
she
used
to
say
from
the
first
she
never
meant
to
have
him
and
this
was
what
provoked
the
signor
so
and
with
good
reason
for
who
likes
to
be
told
that
he
is
disagreeable
and
this
was
saying
as
good
it
was
enough
to
tell
him
this
she
need
not
have
gone
and
married
anotherâ€
â€œwhat
she
married
then
on
purpose
to
plague
the
signorâ€
said
ugo
â€œi
donâ€™t
know
as
for
thatâ€
replied
bertrand
â€œthey
said
indeed
that
she
had
had
a
regard
for
the
other
gentleman
a
great
while
but
that
is
nothing
to
the
purpose
she
should
not
have
married
him
and
then
the
signor
would
not
have
been
so
much
provoked
she
might
have
expected
what
was
to
follow
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
he
would
bear
her
ill
usage
tamely
and
she
might
thank
herself
for
what
happened
but
as
i
said
they
set
out
for
padua
she
and
her
husband
and
the
road
lay
over
some
barren
mountains
like
these
this
suited
the
signorâ€™s
purpose
well
he
watched
the
time
of
their
departure
and
sent
his
men
after
them
with
directions
what
to
do
they
kept
their
distance
till
they
saw
their
opportunity
and
this
did
not
happen
till
the
second
dayâ€™s
journey
when
the
gentleman
having
sent
his
servants
forward
to
the
next
town
maybe
to
have
horses
in
readiness
the
signorâ€™s
men
quickened
their
pace
and
overtook
the
carriage
in
a
hollow
between
two
mountains
where
the
woods
prevented
the
servants
from
seeing
what
passed
though
they
were
then
not
far
off
when
we
came
up
we
fired
our
tromboni
but
missedâ€
emily
turned
pale
at
these
words
and
then
hoped
she
had
mistaken
them
while
bertrand
proceeded
â€œthe
gentleman
fired
again
but
he
was
soon
made
to
alight
and
it
was
as
he
turned
to
call
his
people
that
he
was
struck
it
was
the
most
dexterous
feat
you
ever
sawâ€”he
was
struck
in
the
back
with
three
stillettos
at
once
he
fell
and
was
dispatched
in
a
minute
but
the
lady
escaped
for
the
servants
had
heard
the
firing
and
came
up
before
she
could
be
taken
care
of
â€˜bertrandâ€™
said
the
signor
when
his
men
returnedâ€”â€
â€œbertrandâ€
exclaimed
emily
pale
with
horror
on
whom
not
a
syllable
of
this
narrative
had
been
lost
â€œbertrand
did
i
sayâ€
rejoined
the
man
with
some
confusionâ€”â€œno
giovanni
but
i
have
forgot
where
i
wasâ€”â€˜bertrandâ€™
said
the
signorâ€”
â€œbertrand
againâ€
said
emily
in
a
faltering
voice
â€œwhy
do
you
repeat
that
nameâ€
bertrand
swore
â€œwhat
signifies
itâ€
he
proceeded
â€œwhat
the
man
was
calledâ€”bertrand
or
giovanniâ€”or
roberto
itâ€™s
all
one
for
that
you
have
put
me
out
twice
with
thatâ€”question
bertrand
or
giovanniâ€”or
what
you
willâ€”â€˜bertrandâ€™
said
the
signor
â€˜if
your
comrades
had
done
their
duty
as
well
as
you
i
should
not
have
lost
the
lady
go
my
honest
fellow
and
be
happy
with
thisâ€™
he
gave
him
a
purse
of
goldâ€”and
little
enough
too
considering
the
service
he
had
done
himâ€
â€œaye
ayeâ€
said
ugo
â€œlittle
enoughâ€”little
enoughâ€
emily
now
breathed
with
difficulty
and
could
scarcely
support
herself
when
first
she
saw
these
men
their
appearance
and
their
connection
with
montoni
had
been
sufficient
to
impress
her
with
distrust
but
now
when
one
of
them
had
betrayed
himself
to
be
a
murderer
and
she
saw
herself
at
the
approach
of
night
under
his
guidance
among
wild
and
solitary
mountains
and
going
she
scarcely
knew
whither
the
most
agonizing
terror
seized
her
which
was
the
less
supportable
from
the
necessity
she
found
herself
under
of
concealing
all
symptoms
of
it
from
her
companions
reflecting
on
the
character
and
the
menaces
of
montoni
it
appeared
not
improbable
that
he
had
delivered
her
to
them
for
the
purpose
of
having
her
murdered
and
of
thus
securing
to
himself
without
further
opposition
or
delay
the
estates
for
which
he
had
so
long
and
so
desperately
contended
yet
if
this
was
his
design
there
appeared
no
necessity
for
sending
her
to
such
a
distance
from
the
castle
for
if
any
dread
of
discovery
had
made
him
unwilling
to
perpetrate
the
deed
there
a
much
nearer
place
might
have
sufficed
for
the
purpose
of
concealment
these
considerations
however
did
not
immediately
occur
to
emily
with
whom
so
many
circumstances
conspired
to
rouse
terror
that
she
had
no
power
to
oppose
it
or
to
enquire
coolly
into
its
grounds
and
if
she
had
done
so
still
there
were
many
appearances
which
would
too
well
have
justified
her
most
terrible
apprehensions
she
did
not
now
dare
to
speak
to
her
conductors
at
the
sound
of
whose
voices
she
trembled
and
when
now
and
then
she
stole
a
glance
at
them
their
countenances
seen
imperfectly
through
the
gloom
of
evening
served
to
confirm
her
fears
the
sun
had
now
been
set
some
time
heavy
clouds
whose
lower
skirts
were
tinged
with
sulphureous
crimson
lingered
in
the
west
and
threw
a
reddish
tint
upon
the
pine
forests
which
sent
forth
a
solemn
sound
as
the
breeze
rolled
over
them
the
hollow
moan
struck
upon
emilyâ€™s
heart
and
served
to
render
more
gloomy
and
terrific
every
object
around
herâ€”the
mountains
shaded
in
twilightâ€”the
gleaming
torrent
hoarsely
roaringâ€”the
black
forests
and
the
deep
glen
broken
into
rocky
recesses
high
overshadowed
by
cypress
and
sycamore
and
winding
into
long
obscurity
to
this
glen
emily
as
she
sent
forth
her
anxious
eye
thought
there
was
no
end
no
hamlet
or
even
cottage
was
seen
and
still
no
distant
bark
of
watch-dog
or
even
faint
far-off
halloo
came
on
the
wind
in
a
tremulous
voice
she
now
ventured
to
remind
the
guides
that
it
was
growing
late
and
to
ask
again
how
far
they
had
to
go
but
they
were
too
much
occupied
by
their
own
discourse
to
attend
to
her
question
which
she
forbore
to
repeat
lest
it
should
provoke
a
surly
answer
having
however
soon
after
finished
their
supper
the
men
collected
the
fragments
into
their
wallet
and
proceeded
along
this
winding
glen
in
gloomy
silence
while
emily
again
mused
upon
her
own
situation
and
concerning
the
motives
of
montoni
for
involving
her
in
it
that
it
was
for
some
evil
purpose
towards
herself
she
could
not
doubt
and
it
seemed
that
if
he
did
not
intend
to
destroy
her
with
a
view
of
immediately
seizing
her
estates
he
meant
to
reserve
her
a
while
in
concealment
for
some
more
terrible
design
for
one
that
might
equally
gratify
his
avarice
and
still
more
his
deep
revenge
at
this
moment
remembering
signor
brochio
and
his
behaviour
in
the
corridor
a
few
preceding
nights
the
latter
supposition
horrible
as
it
was
strengthened
in
her
belief
yet
why
remove
her
from
the
castle
where
deeds
of
darkness
had
she
feared
been
often
executed
with
secrecyâ€”from
chambers
perhaps
with
many
a
foul
and
midnight
murder
stainâ€™d
the
dread
of
what
she
might
be
going
to
encounter
was
now
so
excessive
that
it
sometimes
threatened
her
senses
and
often
as
she
went
she
thought
of
her
late
father
and
of
all
he
would
have
suffered
could
he
have
foreseen
the
strange
and
dreadful
events
of
her
future
life
and
how
anxiously
he
would
have
avoided
that
fatal
confidence
which
committed
his
daughter
to
the
care
of
a
woman
so
weak
as
was
madame
montoni
so
romantic
and
improbable
indeed
did
her
present
situation
appear
to
emily
herself
particularly
when
she
compared
it
with
the
repose
and
beauty
of
her
early
days
that
there
were
moments
when
she
could
almost
have
believed
herself
the
victim
of
frightful
visions
glaring
upon
a
disordered
fancy
restrained
by
the
presence
of
her
guides
from
expressing
her
terrors
their
acuteness
was
at
length
lost
in
gloomy
despair
the
dreadful
view
of
what
might
await
her
hereafter
rendered
her
almost
indifferent
to
the
surrounding
dangers
she
now
looked
with
little
emotion
on
the
wild
dingles
and
the
gloomy
road
and
mountains
whose
outlines
were
only
distinguishable
through
the
duskâ€”objects
which
but
lately
had
affected
her
spirits
so
much
as
to
awaken
horrid
views
of
the
future
and
to
tinge
these
with
their
own
gloom
it
was
now
so
nearly
dark
that
the
travellers
who
proceeded
only
by
the
slowest
pace
could
scarcely
discern
their
way
the
clouds
which
seemed
charged
with
thunder
passed
slowly
along
the
heavens
showing
at
intervals
the
trembling
stars
while
the
groves
of
cypress
and
sycamore
that
overhung
the
rocks
waved
high
in
the
breeze
as
it
swept
over
the
glen
and
then
rushed
among
the
distant
woods
emily
shivered
as
it
passed
â€œwhere
is
the
torchâ€
said
ugo
â€œit
grows
darkâ€
â€œnot
so
dark
yetâ€
replied
bertrand
â€œbut
we
may
find
our
way
and
â€™tis
best
not
light
the
torch
before
we
can
help
for
it
may
betray
us
if
any
straggling
party
of
the
enemy
is
abroadâ€
ugo
muttered
something
which
emily
did
not
understand
and
they
proceeded
in
darkness
while
she
almost
wished
that
the
enemy
might
discover
them
for
from
change
there
was
something
to
hope
since
she
could
scarcely
imagine
any
situation
more
dreadful
than
her
present
one
as
they
moved
slowly
along
her
attention
was
surprised
by
a
thin
tapering
flame
that
appeared
by
fits
at
the
point
of
the
pike
which
bertrand
carried
resembling
what
she
had
observed
on
the
lance
of
the
sentinel
the
night
madame
montoni
died
and
which
he
had
said
was
an
omen
the
event
immediately
following
it
appeared
to
justify
the
assertion
and
a
superstitious
impression
had
remained
on
emilyâ€™s
mind
which
the
present
appearance
confirmed
she
thought
it
was
an
omen
of
her
own
fate
and
watched
it
successively
vanish
and
return
in
gloomy
silence
which
was
at
length
interrupted
by
bertrand
â€œlet
us
light
the
torchâ€
said
he
â€œand
get
under
shelter
of
the
woodsâ€”a
storm
is
coming
onâ€”look
at
my
lanceâ€
he
held
it
forth
with
the
flame
tapering
at
its
point
note
see
the
abbã©
berthelon
on
electricity
a
r
â€œayeâ€
said
ugo
â€œyou
are
not
one
of
those
that
believe
in
omens
we
have
left
cowards
at
the
castle
who
would
turn
pale
at
such
a
sight
i
have
often
seen
it
before
a
thunder-storm
it
is
an
omen
of
that
and
one
is
coming
now
sure
enough
the
clouds
flash
fast
alreadyâ€
emily
was
relieved
by
this
conversation
from
some
of
the
terrors
of
superstition
but
those
of
reason
increased
as
waiting
while
ugo
searched
for
a
flint
to
strike
fire
she
watched
the
pale
lightning
gleam
over
the
woods
they
were
about
to
enter
and
illumine
the
harsh
countenances
of
her
companions
ugo
could
not
find
a
flint
and
bertrand
became
impatient
for
the
thunder
sounded
hollowly
at
a
distance
and
the
lightning
was
more
frequent
sometimes
it
revealed
the
nearer
recesses
of
the
woods
or
displaying
some
opening
in
their
summits
illumined
the
ground
beneath
with
partial
splendour
the
thick
foliage
of
the
trees
preserving
the
surrounding
scene
in
deep
shadow
at
length
ugo
found
a
flint
and
the
torch
was
lighted
the
men
then
dismounted
and
having
assisted
emily
led
the
mules
towards
the
woods
that
skirted
the
glen
on
the
left
over
broken
ground
frequently
interrupted
with
brush-wood
and
wild
plants
which
she
was
often
obliged
to
make
a
circuit
to
avoid
she
could
not
approach
these
woods
without
experiencing
keener
sense
of
her
danger
their
deep
silence
except
when
the
wind
swept
among
their
branches
and
impenetrable
glooms
shown
partially
by
the
sudden
flash
and
then
by
the
red
glare
of
the
torch
which
served
only
to
make
â€œdarkness
visibleâ€
were
circumstances
that
contributed
to
renew
all
her
most
terrible
apprehensions
she
thought
too
that
at
this
moment
the
countenances
of
her
conductors
displayed
more
than
their
usual
fierceness
mingled
with
a
kind
of
lurking
exultation
which
they
seemed
endeavouring
to
disguise
to
her
affrighted
fancy
it
occurred
that
they
were
leading
her
into
these
woods
to
complete
the
will
of
montoni
by
her
murder
the
horrid
suggestion
called
a
groan
from
her
heart
which
surprised
her
companions
who
turned
round
quickly
towards
her
and
she
demanded
why
they
led
her
thither
beseeching
them
to
continue
their
way
along
the
open
glen
which
she
represented
to
be
less
dangerous
than
the
woods
in
a
thunder-storm
â€œno
noâ€
said
bertrand
â€œwe
know
best
where
the
danger
lies
see
how
the
clouds
open
over
our
heads
besides
we
can
glide
under
cover
of
the
woods
with
less
hazard
of
being
seen
should
any
of
the
enemy
be
wandering
this
way
by
holy
st
peter
and
all
the
rest
of
them
iâ€™ve
as
stout
a
heart
as
the
best
as
many
a
poor
devil
could
tell
if
he
were
alive
againâ€”but
what
can
we
do
against
numbersâ€
â€œwhat
are
you
whining
aboutâ€
said
ugo
contemptuously
â€œwho
fears
numbers
let
them
come
though
they
were
as
many
as
the
signorâ€™s
castle
could
hold
i
would
show
the
knaves
what
fighting
is
for
youâ€”i
would
lay
you
quietly
in
a
dry
ditch
where
you
might
peep
out
and
see
me
put
the
rogues
to
flightâ€”who
talks
of
fearâ€
bertrand
replied
with
a
horrible
oath
that
he
did
not
like
such
jesting
and
a
violent
altercation
ensued
which
was
at
length
silenced
by
the
thunder
whose
deep
volley
was
heard
afar
rolling
onward
till
it
burst
over
their
heads
in
sounds
that
seemed
to
shake
the
earth
to
its
centre
the
ruffians
paused
and
looked
upon
each
other
between
the
boles
of
the
trees
the
blue
lightning
flashed
and
quivered
along
the
ground
while
as
emily
looked
under
the
boughs
the
mountains
beyond
frequently
appeared
to
be
clothed
in
livid
flame
at
this
moment
perhaps
she
felt
less
fear
of
the
storm
than
did
either
of
her
companions
for
other
terrors
occupied
her
mind
the
men
now
rested
under
an
enormous
chesnut-tree
and
fixed
their
pikes
in
the
ground
at
some
distance
on
the
iron
points
of
which
emily
repeatedly
observed
the
lightning
play
and
then
glide
down
them
into
the
earth
â€œi
would
we
were
well
in
the
signorâ€™s
castleâ€
said
bertrand
â€œi
know
not
why
he
should
send
us
on
this
business
hark
how
it
rattles
above
there
i
could
almost
find
in
my
heart
to
turn
priest
and
pray
ugo
hast
got
a
rosaryâ€
â€œnoâ€
replied
ugo
â€œi
leave
it
to
cowards
like
thee
to
carry
rosariesâ€”i
carry
a
swordâ€
â€œand
much
good
may
it
do
thee
in
fighting
against
the
stormâ€
said
bertrand
another
peal
which
was
reverberated
in
tremendous
echoes
among
the
mountains
silenced
them
for
a
moment
as
it
rolled
away
ugo
proposed
going
on
â€œwe
are
only
losing
time
hereâ€
said
he
â€œfor
the
thick
boughs
of
the
woods
will
shelter
us
as
well
as
this
chesnut-treeâ€
they
again
led
the
mules
forward
between
the
boles
of
the
trees
and
over
pathless
grass
that
concealed
their
high
knotted
roots
the
rising
wind
was
now
heard
contending
with
the
thunder
as
it
rushed
furiously
among
the
branches
above
and
brightened
the
red
flame
of
the
torch
which
threw
a
stronger
light
forward
among
the
woods
and
showed
their
gloomy
recesses
to
be
suitable
resorts
for
the
wolves
of
which
ugo
had
formerly
spoken
at
length
the
strength
of
the
wind
seemed
to
drive
the
storm
before
it
for
the
thunder
rolled
away
into
distance
and
was
only
faintly
heard
after
travelling
through
the
woods
for
nearly
an
hour
during
which
the
elements
seemed
to
have
returned
to
repose
the
travellers
gradually
ascending
from
the
glen
found
themselves
upon
the
open
brow
of
a
mountain
with
a
wide
valley
extending
in
misty
moonlight
at
their
feet
and
above
the
blue
sky
trembling
through
the
few
thin
clouds
that
lingered
after
the
storm
and
were
sinking
slowly
to
the
verge
of
the
horizon
emilyâ€™s
spirits
now
that
she
had
quitted
the
woods
began
to
revive
for
she
considered
that
if
these
men
had
received
an
order
to
destroy
her
they
would
probably
have
executed
their
barbarous
purpose
in
the
solitary
wild
from
whence
they
had
just
emerged
where
the
deed
would
have
been
shrouded
from
every
human
eye
reassured
by
this
reflection
and
by
the
quiet
demeanour
of
her
guides
emily
as
they
proceeded
silently
in
a
kind
of
sheep
track
that
wound
along
the
skirts
of
the
woods
which
ascended
on
the
right
could
not
survey
the
sleeping
beauty
of
the
vale
to
which
they
were
declining
without
a
momentary
sensation
of
pleasure
it
seemed
varied
with
woods
pastures
and
sloping
grounds
and
was
screened
to
the
north
and
the
east
by
an
amphitheatre
of
the
apennines
whose
outline
on
the
horizon
was
here
broken
into
varied
and
elegant
forms
to
the
west
and
the
south
the
landscape
extended
indistinctly
into
the
lowlands
of
tuscany
â€œthere
is
the
sea
yonderâ€
said
bertrand
as
if
he
had
known
that
emily
was
examining
the
twilight
view
â€œyonder
in
the
west
though
we
cannot
see
itâ€
emily
already
perceived
a
change
in
the
climate
from
that
of
the
wild
and
mountainous
tract
she
had
left
and
as
she
continued
descending
the
air
became
perfumed
by
the
breath
of
a
thousand
nameless
flowers
among
the
grass
called
forth
by
the
late
rain
so
soothingly
beautiful
was
the
scene
around
her
and
so
strikingly
contrasted
to
the
gloomy
grandeur
of
those
to
which
she
had
long
been
confined
and
to
the
manners
of
the
people
who
moved
among
them
that
she
could
almost
have
fancied
herself
again
at
la
vallã©e
and
wondering
why
montoni
had
sent
her
hither
could
scarcely
believe
that
he
had
selected
so
enchanting
a
spot
for
any
cruel
design
it
was
however
probably
not
the
spot
but
the
persons
who
happened
to
inhabit
it
and
to
whose
care
he
could
safely
commit
the
execution
of
his
plans
whatever
they
might
be
that
had
determined
his
choice
she
now
ventured
again
to
enquire
whether
they
were
near
the
place
of
their
destination
and
was
answered
by
ugo
that
they
had
not
far
to
go
â€œonly
to
the
wood
of
chesnuts
in
the
valley
yonderâ€
said
he
â€œthere
by
the
brook
that
sparkles
with
the
moon
i
wish
i
was
once
at
rest
there
with
a
flask
of
good
wine
and
a
slice
of
tuscany
baconâ€
emilyâ€™s
spirits
revived
when
she
heard
that
the
journey
was
so
nearly
concluded
and
saw
the
wood
of
chesnuts
in
an
open
part
of
the
vale
on
the
margin
of
the
stream
in
a
short
time
they
reached
the
entrance
of
the
wood
and
perceived
between
the
twinkling
leaves
a
light
streaming
from
a
distant
cottage
window
they
proceeded
along
the
edge
of
the
brook
to
where
the
trees
crowding
over
it
excluded
the
moonbeams
but
a
long
line
of
light
from
the
cottage
above
was
seen
on
its
dark
tremulous
surface
bertrand
now
stepped
on
first
and
emily
heard
him
knock
and
call
loudly
at
the
door
as
she
reached
it
the
small
upper
casement
where
the
light
appeared
was
unclosed
by
a
man
who
having
enquired
what
they
wanted
immediately
descended
let
them
into
a
neat
rustic
cot
and
called
up
his
wife
to
set
refreshments
before
the
travellers
as
this
man
conversed
rather
apart
with
bertrand
emily
anxiously
surveyed
him
he
was
a
tall
but
not
robust
peasant
of
a
sallow
complexion
and
had
a
shrewd
and
cunning
eye
his
countenance
was
not
of
a
character
to
win
the
ready
confidence
of
youth
and
there
was
nothing
in
his
manner
that
might
conciliate
a
stranger
ugo
called
impatiently
for
supper
and
in
a
tone
as
if
he
knew
his
authority
here
to
be
unquestionable
â€œi
expected
you
an
hour
agoâ€
said
the
peasant
â€œfor
i
have
had
signor
montoniâ€™s
letter
these
three
hours
and
i
and
my
wife
had
given
you
up
and
gone
to
bed
how
did
you
fare
in
the
stormâ€
â€œill
enoughâ€
replied
ugo
â€œill
enough
and
we
are
like
to
fare
ill
enough
here
too
unless
you
will
make
more
haste
get
us
more
wine
and
let
us
see
what
you
have
to
eatâ€
the
peasant
placed
before
them
all
that
his
cottage
affordedâ€”ham
wine
figs
and
grapes
of
such
size
and
flavour
as
emily
had
seldom
tasted
after
taking
refreshment
she
was
shown
by
the
peasantâ€™s
wife
to
her
little
bed-chamber
where
she
asked
some
questions
concerning
montoni
to
which
the
woman
whose
name
was
dorina
gave
reserved
answers
pretending
ignorance
of
his
excellenzaâ€™s
intention
in
sending
emily
hither
but
acknowledging
that
her
husband
had
been
apprized
of
the
circumstance
perceiving
that
she
could
obtain
no
intelligence
concerning
her
destination
emily
dismissed
dorina
and
retired
to
repose
but
all
the
busy
scenes
of
her
past
and
the
anticipated
ones
of
the
future
came
to
her
anxious
mind
and
conspired
with
the
sense
of
her
new
situation
to
banish
sleep
was
nought
around
but
images
of
rest
sleep-soothing
groves
and
quiet
lawns
between
and
flowery
beds
that
slumbrous
influence
kept
from
poppies
breathâ€™d
and
banks
of
pleasant
green
where
never
yet
was
creeping
creature
seen
meantime
unnumbered
glittering
streamlets
playâ€™d
and
hurled
everywhere
their
waterâ€™s
sheen
that
as
they
bickerâ€™d
through
the
sunny
glade
though
restless
still
themselves
a
lulling
murmur
made
thomson
when
emily
in
the
morning
opened
her
casement
she
was
surprised
to
observe
the
beauties
that
surrounded
it
the
cottage
was
nearly
embowered
in
the
woods
which
were
chiefly
of
chesnut
intermixed
with
some
cypress
larch
and
sycamore
beneath
the
dark
and
spreading
branches
appeared
to
the
north
and
to
the
east
the
woody
apennines
rising
in
majestic
amphitheatre
not
black
with
pines
as
she
had
been
accustomed
to
see
them
but
their
loftiest
summits
crowned
with
ancient
forests
of
chesnut
oak
and
oriental
plane
now
animated
with
the
rich
tints
of
autumn
and
which
swept
downward
to
the
valley
uninterruptedly
except
where
some
bold
rocky
promontory
looked
out
from
among
the
foliage
and
caught
the
passing
gleam
vineyards
stretched
along
the
feet
of
the
mountains
where
the
elegant
villas
of
the
tuscan
nobility
frequently
adorned
the
scene
and
overlooked
slopes
clothed
with
groves
of
olive
mulberry
orange
and
lemon
the
plain
to
which
these
declined
was
coloured
with
the
riches
of
cultivation
whose
mingled
hues
were
mellowed
into
harmony
by
an
italian
sun
vines
their
purple
clusters
blushing
between
the
russet
foliage
hung
in
luxuriant
festoons
from
the
branches
of
standard
fig
and
cherry
trees
while
pastures
of
verdure
such
as
emily
had
seldom
seen
in
italy
enriched
the
banks
of
a
stream
that
after
descending
from
the
mountains
wound
along
the
landscape
which
it
reflected
to
a
bay
of
the
sea
there
far
in
the
west
the
waters
fading
into
the
sky
assumed
a
tint
of
the
faintest
purple
and
the
line
of
separation
between
them
was
now
and
then
discernible
only
by
the
progress
of
a
sail
brightened
with
the
sunbeam
along
the
horizon
the
cottage
which
was
shaded
by
the
woods
from
the
intenser
rays
of
the
sun
and
was
open
only
to
his
evening
light
was
covered
entirely
with
vines
fig-trees
and
jessamine
whose
flowers
surpassed
in
size
and
fragrance
any
that
emily
had
seen
these
and
ripening
clusters
of
grapes
hung
round
her
little
casement
the
turf
that
grew
under
the
woods
was
inlaid
with
a
variety
of
wild
flowers
and
perfumed
herbs
and
on
the
opposite
margin
of
the
stream
whose
current
diffused
freshness
beneath
the
shades
rose
a
grove
of
lemon
and
orange
trees
this
though
nearly
opposite
to
emilyâ€™s
window
did
not
interrupt
her
prospect
but
rather
heightened
by
its
dark
verdure
the
effect
of
the
perspective
and
to
her
this
spot
was
a
bower
of
sweets
whose
charms
communicated
imperceptibly
to
her
mind
somewhat
of
their
own
serenity
she
was
soon
summoned
to
breakfast
by
the
peasantâ€™s
daughter
a
girl
about
seventeen
of
a
pleasant
countenance
which
emily
was
glad
to
observe
seemed
animated
with
the
pure
affections
of
nature
though
the
others
that
surrounded
her
expressed
more
or
less
the
worst
qualitiesâ€”cruelty
ferocity
cunning
and
duplicity
of
the
latter
style
of
countenance
especially
were
those
of
the
peasant
and
his
wife
maddelina
spoke
little
but
what
she
said
was
in
a
soft
voice
and
with
an
air
of
modesty
and
complacency
that
interested
emily
who
breakfasted
at
a
separate
table
with
dorina
while
ugo
and
bertrand
were
taking
a
repast
of
tuscany
bacon
and
wine
with
their
host
near
the
cottage
door
when
they
had
finished
which
ugo
rising
hastily
enquired
for
his
mule
and
emily
learned
that
he
was
to
return
to
udolpho
while
bertrand
remained
at
the
cottage
a
circumstance
which
though
it
did
not
surprise
distressed
her
when
ugo
was
departed
emily
proposed
to
walk
in
the
neighbouring
woods
but
on
being
told
that
she
must
not
quit
the
cottage
without
having
bertrand
for
her
attendant
she
withdrew
to
her
own
room
there
as
her
eyes
settled
on
the
towering
apennines
she
recollected
the
terrific
scenery
they
had
exhibited
and
the
horrors
she
had
suffered
on
the
preceding
night
particularly
at
the
moment
when
bertrand
had
betrayed
himself
to
be
an
assassin
and
these
remembrances
awakened
a
train
of
images
which
since
they
abstracted
her
from
a
consideration
of
her
own
situation
she
pursued
for
some
time
and
then
arranged
in
the
following
lines
pleased
to
have
discovered
any
innocent
means
by
which
she
could
beguile
an
hour
of
misfortune
the
pilgrim
slow
oâ€™er
the
apennine
with
bleeding
feet
a
patient
pilgrim
wound
his
lonely
way
to
deck
the
lady
of
lorettoâ€™s
seat
with
all
the
little
wealth
his
zeal
could
pay
from
mountain-tops
cold
died
the
evening
ray
and
stretchâ€™d
in
twilight
slept
the
vale
below
and
now
the
last
last
purple
streaks
of
day
along
the
melancholy
west
fade
slow
high
oâ€™er
his
head
the
restless
pines
complain
as
on
their
summit
rolls
the
breeze
of
night
beneath
the
hoarse
stream
chides
the
rocks
in
vain
the
pilgrim
pauses
on
the
dizzy
height
then
to
the
vale
his
cautious
step
he
pressâ€™d
for
there
a
hermitâ€™s
cross
was
dimly
seen
cresting
the
rock
and
there
his
limbs
might
rest
cheerâ€™d
in
the
good
manâ€™s
cave
by
faggotâ€™s
sheen
on
leafy
beds
nor
guile
his
sleep
molest
unhappy
luke
he
trusts
a
treacherous
clue
behind
the
cliff
the
lurking
robber
stood
no
friendly
moon
his
giant
shadow
threw
athwart
the
road
to
save
the
pilgrimâ€™s
blood
on
as
he
went
a
vesper-hymn
he
sang
the
hymn
that
nightly
soothâ€™d
him
to
repose
fierce
on
his
harmless
prey
the
ruffian
sprang
the
pilgrim

to
death

prayâ€™r
note
this
poem
and
that
entitled
the
traveller
in
vol
ii
have
already
appeared
in
a
periodical
publication
a
r
preferring
the
solitude
of
her
room
to
the
company
of
the
persons
below
stairs
emily
dined
above
and
maddelina
was
suffered
to
attend
her
from
whose
simple
conversation
she
learned
that
the
peasant
and
his
wife
were
old
inhabitants
of
this
cottage
which
had
been
purchased
for
them
by
montoni
in
reward
of
some
service
rendered
him
many
years
before
by
marco
to
whom
carlo
the
steward
at
the
castle
was
nearly
related
â€œso
many
years
ago
signoraâ€
added
maddelina
â€œthat
i
know
nothing
about
it
but
my
father
did
the
signor
a
great
good
for
my
mother
has
often
said
to
him
this
cottage
was
the
least
he
ought
to
have
hadâ€
to
the
mention
of
this
circumstance
emily
listened
with
a
painful
interest
since
it
appeared
to
give
a
frightful
colour
to
the
character
of
marco
whose
service
thus
rewarded
by
montoni
she
could
scarcely
doubt
have
been
criminal
and
if
so
had
too
much
reason
to
believe
that
she
had
been
committed
into
his
hands
for
some
desperate
purpose
â€œdid
you
ever
hear
how
many
years
it
isâ€
said
emily
who
was
considering
of
signora
laurentiniâ€™s
disappearance
from
udolpho
â€œsince
your
father
performed
the
services
you
spoke
ofâ€
â€œit
was
a
little
before
he
came
to
live
at
the
cottage
signoraâ€
replied
maddelina
â€œand
that
is
about
eighteen
years
agoâ€
this
was
near
the
period
when
signora
laurentini
had
been
said
to
disappear
and
it
occurred
to
emily
that
marco
had
assisted
in
that
mysterious
affair
and
perhaps
had
been
employed
in
a
murder
this
horrible
suggestion
fixed
her
in
such
profound
reverie
that
maddelina
quitted
the
room
unperceived
by
her
and
she
remained
unconscious
of
all
around
her
for
a
considerable
time
tears
at
length
came
to
her
relief
after
indulging
which
her
spirits
becoming
calmer
she
ceased
to
tremble
at
a
view
of
evils
that
might
never
arrive
and
had
sufficient
resolution
to
endeavour
to
withdraw
her
thoughts
from
the
contemplation
of
her
own
interests
remembering
the
few
books
which
even
in
the
hurry
of
her
departure
from
udolpho
she
had
put
into
her
little
package
she
sat
down
with
one
of
them
at
her
pleasant
casement
whence
her
eyes
often
wandered
from
the
page
to
the
landscape
whose
beauty
gradually
soothed
her
mind
into
gentle
melancholy
here
she
remained
alone
till
evening
and
saw
the
sun
descend
the
western
sky
throw
all
his
pomp
of
light
and
shadow
upon
the
mountains
and
gleam
upon
the
distant
ocean
and
the
stealing
sails
as
he
sunk
amidst
the
waves
then
at
the
musing
hour
of
twilight
her
softened
thoughts
returned
to
valancourt
she
again
recollected
every
circumstance
connected
with
the
midnight
music
and
all
that
might
assist
her
conjecture
concerning
his
imprisonment
at
the
castle
and
becoming
confirmed
in
the
supposition
that
it
was
his
voice
she
had
heard
there
she
looked
back
to
that
gloomy
abode
with
emotions
of
grief
and
momentary
regret
refreshed
by
the
cool
and
fragrant
air
and
her
spirits
soothed
to
a
state
of
gentle
melancholy
by
the
still
murmur
of
the
brook
below
and
of
the
woods
around
she
lingered
at
her
casement
long
after
the
sun
had
set
watching
the
valley
sinking
into
obscurity
till
only
the
grand
outline
of
the
surrounding
mountains
shadowed
upon
the
horizon
remained
visible
but
a
clear
moonlight
that
succeeded
gave
to
the
landscape
what
time
gives
to
the
scenes
of
past
life
when
it
softens
all
their
harsher
features
and
throws
over
the
whole
the
mellowing
shade
of
distant
contemplation
the
scenes
of
la
vallã©e
in
the
early
morn
of
her
life
when
she
was
protected
and
beloved
by
parents
equally
loved
appeared
in
emilyâ€™s
memory
tenderly
beautiful
like
the
prospect
before
her
and
awakened
mournful
comparisons
unwilling
to
encounter
the
coarse
behaviour
of
the
peasantâ€™s
wife
she
remained
supperless
in
her
room
while
she
wept
again
over
her
forlorn
and
perilous
situation
a
review
of
which
entirely
overcame
the
small
remains
of
her
fortitude
and
reducing
her
to
temporary
despondence
she
wished
to
be
released
from
the
heavy
load
of
life
that
had
so
long
oppressed
her
and
prayed
to
heaven
to
take
her
in
its
mercy
to
her
parents
wearied
with
weeping
she
at
length
lay
down
on
her
mattress
and
sunk
to
sleep
but
was
soon
awakened
by
a
knocking
at
her
chamber
door
and
starting
up
in
terror
she
heard
a
voice
calling
her
the
image
of
bertrand
with
a
stilletto
in
his
hand
appeared
to
her
alarmed
fancy
and
she
neither
opened
the
door
nor
answered
but
listened
in
profound
silence
till
the
voice
repeating
her
name
in
the
same
low
tone
she
demanded
who
called
â€œit
is
i
signoraâ€
replied
the
voice
which
she
now
distinguished
to
be
maddelinaâ€™s
â€œpray
open
the
door
donâ€™t
be
frightened
it
is
iâ€
â€œand
what
brings
you
here
so
late
maddelinaâ€
said
emily
as
she
let
her
in
â€œhush
signora
for
heavenâ€™s
sake
hushâ€”if
we
are
overheard
i
shall
never
be
forgiven
my
father
and
mother
and
bertrand
are
all
gone
to
bedâ€
continued
maddelina
as
she
gently
shut
the
door
and
crept
forward
â€œand
i
have
brought
you
some
supper
for
you
had
none
you
know
signora
below
stairs
here
are
some
grapes
and
figs
and
half
a
cup
of
wineâ€
emily
thanked
her
but
expressed
apprehension
lest
this
kindness
should
draw
upon
her
the
resentment
of
dorina
when
she
perceived
the
fruit
was
gone
â€œtake
it
back
therefore
maddelinaâ€
added
emily
â€œi
shall
suffer
much
less
from
the
want
of
it
than
i
should
do
if
this
act
of
good-nature
was
to
subject
you
to
your
motherâ€™s
displeasureâ€
â€œo
signora
there
is
no
danger
of
thatâ€
replied
maddelina
â€œmy
mother
cannot
miss
the
fruit
for
i
saved
it
from
my
own
supper
you
will
make
me
very
unhappy
if
you
refuse
to
take
it
signoraâ€
emily
was
so
much
affected
by
this
instance
of
the
good
girlâ€™s
generosity
that
she
remained
for
some
time
unable
to
reply
and
maddelina
watched
her
in
silence
till
mistaking
the
cause
of
her
emotion
she
said
â€œdo
not
weep
so
signora
my
mother
to
be
sure
is
a
little
cross
sometimes
but
then
it
is
soon
overâ€”so
donâ€™t
take
it
so
much
to
heart
she
often
scolds
me
too
but
then
i
have
learned
to
bear
it
and
when
she
has
done
if
i
can
but
steal
out
into
the
woods
and
play
upon
my
sticcado
i
forget
it
all
directlyâ€
emily
smiling
through
her
tears
told
maddelina
that
she
was
a
good
girl
and
then
accepted
her
offering
she
wished
anxiously
to
know
whether
bertrand
and
dorina
had
spoken
of
montoni
or
of
his
designs
concerning
herself
in
the
presence
of
maddelina
but
disdained
to
tempt
the
innocent
girl
to
a
conduct
so
mean
as
that
of
betraying
the
private
conversations
of
her
parents
when
she
was
departing
emily
requested
that
she
would
come
to
her
room
as
often
as
she
dared
without
offending
her
mother
and
maddelina
after
promising
that
she
would
do
so
stole
softly
back
again
to
her
own
chamber
thus
several
days
passed
during
which
emily
remained
in
her
own
room
maddelina
attending
her
only
at
her
repast
whose
gentle
countenance
and
manners
soothed
her
more
than
any
circumstance
she
had
known
for
many
months
of
her
pleasant
embowered
chamber
she
now
became
fond
and
began
to
experience
in
it
those
feelings
of
security
which
we
naturally
attach
to
home
in
this
interval
also
her
mind
having
been
undisturbed
by
any
new
circumstance
of
disgust
or
alarm
recovered
its
tone
sufficiently
to
permit
her
the
enjoyment
of
her
books
among
which
she
found
some
unfinished
sketches
of
landscapes
several
blank
sheets
of
paper
with
her
drawing
instruments
and
she
was
thus
enabled
to
amuse
herself
with
selecting
some
of
the
lovely
features
of
the
prospect
that
her
window
commanded
and
combining
them
in
scenes
to
which
her
tasteful
fancy
gave
a
last
grace
in
these
little
sketches
she
generally
placed
interesting
groups
characteristic
of
the
scenery
they
animated
and
often
contrived
to
tell
with
perspicuity
some
simple
and
affecting
story
when
as
a
tear
fell
over
the
pictured
griefs
which
her
imagination
drew
she
would
forget
for
a
moment
her
real
sufferings
thus
innocently
she
beguiled
the
heavy
hours
of
misfortune
and
with
meek
patience
awaited
the
events
of
futurity
a
beautiful
evening
that
had
succeeded
to
a
sultry
day
at
length
induced
emily
to
walk
though
she
knew
that
bertrand
must
attend
her
and
with
maddelina
for
her
companion
she
left
the
cottage
followed
by
bertrand
who
allowed
her
to
choose
her
own
way
the
hour
was
cool
and
silent
and
she
could
not
look
upon
the
country
around
her
without
delight
how
lovely
too
appeared
the
brilliant
blue
that
coloured
all
the
upper
region
of
the
air
and
thence
fading
downward
was
lost
in
the
saffron
glow
of
the
horizon
nor
less
so
were
the
varied
shades
and
warm
colouring
of
the
apennines
as
the
evening
sun
threw
his
slanting
rays
athwart
their
broken
surface
emily
followed
the
course
of
the
stream
under
the
shades
that
overhung
its
grassy
margin
on
the
opposite
banks
the
pastures
were
animated
with
herds
of
cattle
of
a
beautiful
cream-colour
and
beyond
were
groves
of
lemon
and
orange
with
fruit
glowing
on
the
branches
frequent
almost
as
the
leaves
which
partly
concealed
it
she
pursued
her
way
towards
the
sea
which
reflected
the
warm
glow
of
sunset
while
the
cliffs
that
rose
over
its
edge
were
tinted
with
the
last
rays
the
valley
was
terminated
on
the
right
by
a
lofty
promontory
whose
summit
impending
over
the
waves
was
crowned
with
a
ruined
tower
now
serving
for
the
purpose
of
a
beacon
whose
shattered
battlements
and
the
extended
wings
of
some
sea-fowl
that
circled
near
it
were
still
illumined
by
the
upward
beams
of
the
sun
though
his
disk
was
now
sunk
beneath
the
horizon
while
the
lower
part
of
the
ruin
the
cliff
on
which
it
stood
and
the
waves
at
its
foot
were
shaded
with
the
first
tints
of
twilight
having
reached
this
headland
emily
gazed
with
solemn
pleasure
on
the
cliffs
that
extended
on
either
hand
along
the
sequestered
shores
some
crowned
with
groves
of
pine
and
others
exhibiting
only
barren
precipices
of
greyish
marble
except
where
the
crags
were
tufted
with
myrtle
and
other
aromatic
shrubs
the
sea
slept
in
a
perfect
calm
its
waves
dying
in
murmurs
on
the
shores
flowed
with
the
gentlest
undulation
while
its
clear
surface
reflected
in
softened
beauty
the
vermeil
tints
of
the
west
emily
as
she
looked
upon
the
ocean
thought
of
france
and
of
past
times
and
she
wished
oh
how
ardently
and
vainlyâ€”wished
that
its
waves
would
bear
her
to
her
distant
native
home
â€œah
that
vesselâ€
said
she
â€œthat
vessel
which
glides
along
so
stately
with
its
tall
sails
reflected
in
the
water
is
perhaps
bound
for
france
happyâ€”happy
barkâ€
she
continued
to
gaze
upon
it
with
warm
emotion
till
the
grey
of
twilight
obscured
the
distance
and
veiled
it
from
her
view
the
melancholy
sound
of
the
waves
at
her
feet
assisted
the
tenderness
that
occasioned
her
tears
and
this
was
the
only
sound
that
broke
upon
the
hour
till
having
followed
the
windings
of
the
beach
for
some
time
a
chorus
of
voices
passed
her
on
the
air
she
paused
a
moment
wishing
to
hear
more
yet
fearing
to
be
seen
and
for
the
first
time
looked
back
to
bertrand
as
her
protector
who
was
following
at
a
short
distance
in
company
with
some
other
person
reassured
by
this
circumstance
she
advanced
towards
the
sounds
which
seemed
to
arise
from
behind
a
high
promontory
that
projected
athwart
the
beach
there
was
now
a
sudden
pause
in
the
music
and
then
one
female
voice
was
heard
to
sing
in
a
kind
of
chant
emily
quickened
her
steps
and
winding
round
the
rock
saw
within
the
sweeping
bay
beyond
which
was
hung
with
woods
from
the
borders
of
the
beach
to
the
very
summit
of
the
cliffs
two
groups
of
peasants
one
seated
beneath
the
shades
and
the
other
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
round
the
girl
who
was
singing
and
who
held
in
her
hand
a
chaplet
of
flowers
which
she
seemed
about
to
drop
into
the
waves
emily
listening
with
surprise
and
attention
distinguished
the
following
invocation
delivered
in
the
pure
and
elegant
tongue
of
tuscany
and
accompanied
by
a
few
pastoral
instruments
to
a
sea-nymph
o
nymph
who
loves
to
float
on
the
green
wave
when
neptune
sleeps
beneath
the
moonlight
hour
lullâ€™d
by
the
musicâ€™s
melancholy
powâ€™r
o
nymph
arise
from
out
thy
pearly
cave
for
hesper
beams
amid
the
twilight
shade
and
soon
shall
cynthia
tremble
oâ€™er
the
tide
gleam
on
these
cliffs
that
bound
the
oceanâ€™s
pride
and
lonely
silence
all
the
air
pervade
then
let
thy
tender
voice
at
distance
swell
and
steal
along
this
solitary
shore
sink
on
the
breeze
till
dyingâ€”heard
no
moreâ€”
thou
wakâ€™st
the
sudden
magic
of
thy
shell
while
the
long
coast
in
echo
sweet
replies
thy
soothing
strains
the
pensive
heart
beguile
and
bid
the
visions
of
the
future
smile
o
nymph
from
out
thy
pearly
caveâ€”arise
chorusâ€”arise
semi-chorusâ€”arise
the
last
words
being
repeated
by
the
surrounding
group
the
garland
of
flowers
was
thrown
into
the
waves
and
the
chorus
sinking
gradually
into
a
chant
died
away
in
silence
â€œwhat
can
this
mean
maddelinaâ€
said
emily
awakening
from
the
pleasing
trance
into
which
the
music
had
lulled
her
â€œthis
is
the
eve
of
a
festival
signoraâ€
replied
maddelina
â€œand
the
peasants
then
amuse
themselves
with
all
kinds
of
sportsâ€
â€œbut
they
talked
of
a
sea-nymphâ€
said
emily
â€œhow
came
these
good
people
to
think
of
a
sea-nymphâ€
â€œo
signoraâ€
rejoined
maddelina
mistaking
the
reason
of
emilyâ€™s
surprise
â€œnobody
believes
in
such
things
but
our
old
songs
tell
of
them
and
when
we
are
at
our
sports
we
sometimes
sing
to
them
and
throw
garlands
into
the
seaâ€
emily
had
been
early
taught
to
venerate
florence
as
the
seat
of
literature
and
of
the
fine
arts
but
that
its
taste
for
classic
story
should
descend
to
the
peasants
of
the
country
occasioned
her
both
surprise
and
admiration
the
arcadian
air
of
the
girls
next
attracted
her
attention
their
dress
was
a
very
short
full
petticoat
of
light
green
with
a
boddice
of
white
silk
the
sleeves
loose
and
tied
up
at
the
shoulders
with
ribbons
and
bunches
of
flowers
their
hair
falling
in
ringlets
on
their
necks
was
also
ornamented
with
flowers
and
with
a
small
straw
hat
which
set
rather
backward
and
on
one
side
of
the
head
gave
an
expression
of
gaiety
and
smartness
to
the
whole
figure
when
the
song
had
concluded
several
of
these
girls
approached
emily
and
inviting
her
to
sit
down
among
them
offered
her
and
maddelina
whom
they
knew
grapes
and
figs
emily
accepted
their
courtesy
much
pleased
with
the
gentleness
and
grace
of
their
manners
which
appeared
to
be
perfectly
natural
to
them
and
when
bertrand
soon
after
approached
and
was
hastily
drawing
her
away
a
peasant
holding
up
a
flask
invited
him
to
drink
a
temptation
which
bertrand
was
seldom
very
valiant
in
resisting
â€œlet
the
young
lady
join
in
the
dance
my
friendâ€
said
the
peasant
â€œwhile
we
empty
this
flask
they
are
going
to
begin
directly
strike
up
my
lads
strike
up
your
tambourines
and
merry
flutesâ€
they
sounded
gaily
and
the
younger
peasants
formed
themselves
into
a
circle
which
emily
would
readily
have
joined
had
her
spirits
been
in
unison
with
their
mirth
maddelina
however
tripped
it
lightly
and
emily
as
she
looked
on
the
happy
group
lost
the
sense
of
her
misfortunes
in
that
of
a
benevolent
pleasure
but
the
pensive
melancholy
of
her
mind
returned
as
she
sat
rather
apart
from
the
company
listening
to
the
mellow
music
which
the
breeze
softened
as
it
bore
it
away
and
watching
the
moon
stealing
its
tremulous
light
over
the
waves
and
on
the
woody
summits
of
the
cliffs
that
wound
along
these
tuscan
shores
meanwhile
bertrand
was
so
well
pleased
with
his
first
flask
that
he
very
willingly
commenced
the
attack
on
a
second
and
it
was
late
before
emily
not
without
some
apprehension
returned
to
the
cottage
after
this
evening
she
frequently
walked
with
maddelina
but
was
never
unattended
by
bertrand
and
her
mind
became
by
degrees
as
tranquil
as
the
circumstances
of
her
situation
would
permit
the
quiet
in
which
she
was
suffered
to
live
encouraged
her
to
hope
that
she
was
not
sent
hither
with
an
evil
design
and
had
it
not
appeared
probable
that
valancourt
was
at
this
time
an
inhabitant
of
udolpho
she
would
have
wished
to
remain
at
the
cottage
till
an
opportunity
should
offer
of
returning
to
her
native
country
but
concerning
montoniâ€™s
motive
for
sending
her
into
tuscany
she
was
more
than
ever
perplexed
nor
could
she
believe
that
any
consideration
for
her
safety
had
influenced
him
on
this
occasion
she
had
been
some
time
at
the
cottage
before
she
recollected
that
in
the
hurry
of
leaving
udolpho
she
had
forgotten
the
papers
committed
to
her
by
her
late
aunt
relative
to
the
languedoc
estates
but
though
this
remembrance
occasioned
her
much
uneasiness
she
had
some
hope
that
in
the
obscure
place
where
they
were
deposited
they
would
escape
the
detection
of
montoni
my
tongue
hath
but
a
heavier
tale
to
say
i
play
the
torturer
by
small
and
small
to
lengthen
out
the
worst
that
must
be
spoken
richard
ii
we
now
return
for
a
moment
to
venice
where
count
morano
was
suffering
under
an
accumulation
of
misfortunes
soon
after
his
arrival
in
that
city
he
had
been
arrested
by
order
of
the
senate
and
without
knowing
of
what
he
was
suspected
was
conveyed
to
a
place
of
confinement
whither
the
most
strenuous
enquiries
of
his
friends
had
been
unable
to
trace
him
who
the
enemy
was
that
had
occasioned
him
this
calamity
he
had
not
been
able
to
guess
unless
indeed
it
was
montoni
on
whom
his
suspicions
rested
and
not
only
with
much
apparent
probability
but
with
justice
in
the
affair
of
the
poisoned
cup
montoni
had
suspected
morano
but
being
unable
to
obtain
the
degree
of
proof
which
was
necessary
to
convict
him
of
a
guilty
intention
he
had
recourse
to
means
of
other
revenge
than
he
could
hope
to
obtain
by
prosecution
he
employed
a
person
in
whom
he
believed
he
might
confide
to
drop
a
letter
of
accusation
into
the
denunzie
secrete
or
lionsâ€™
mouths
which
are
fixed
in
a
gallery
of
the
dogeâ€™s
palace
as
receptacles
for
anonymous
information
concerning
persons
who
may
be
disaffected
towards
the
state
as
on
these
occasions
the
accuser
is
not
confronted
with
the
accused
a
man
may
falsely
impeach
his
enemy
and
accomplish
an
unjust
revenge
without
fear
of
punishment
or
detection
that
montoni
should
have
recourse
to
these
diabolical
means
of
ruining
a
person
whom
he
suspected
of
having
attempted
his
life
is
not
in
the
least
surprising
in
the
letter
which
he
had
employed
as
the
instrument
of
his
revenge
he
accused
morano
of
designs
against
the
state
which
he
attempted
to
prove
with
all
the
plausible
simplicity
of
which
he
was
master
and
the
senate
with
whom
a
suspicion
was
at
that
time
almost
equal
to
a
proof
arrested
the
count
in
consequence
of
this
accusation
and
without
even
hinting
to
him
his
crime
threw
him
into
one
of
those
secret
prisons
which
were
the
terror
of
the
venetians
and
in
which
persons
often
languished
and
sometimes
died
without
being
discovered
by
their
friends
morano
had
incurred
the
personal
resentment
of
many
members
of
the
state
his
habits
of
life
had
rendered
him
obnoxious
to
some
and
his
ambition
and
the
bold
rivalship
which
he
discovered
on
several
public
occasionsâ€”to
others
and
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
mercy
would
soften
the
rigour
of
a
law
which
was
to
be
dispensed
from
the
hands
of
his
enemies
montoni
meantime
was
beset
by
dangers
of
another
kind
his
castle
was
besieged
by
troops
who
seemed
willing
to
dare
everything
and
to
suffer
patiently
any
hardships
in
pursuit
of
victory
the
strength
of
the
fortress
however
withstood
their
attack
and
this
with
the
vigorous
defence
of
the
garrison
and
the
scarcity
of
provision
on
these
wild
mountains
soon
compelled
the
assailants
to
raise
the
siege
when
udolpho
was
once
more
left
to
the
quiet
possession
of
montoni
he
dispatched
ugo
into
tuscany
for
emily
whom
he
had
sent
from
considerations
of
her
personal
safety
to
a
place
of
greater
security
than
a
castle
which
was
at
that
time
liable
to
be
overrun
by
his
enemies
tranquillity
being
once
more
restored
to
udolpho
he
was
impatient
to
secure
her
again
under
his
roof
and
had
commissioned
ugo
to
assist
bertrand
in
guarding
her
back
to
the
castle
thus
compelled
to
return
emily
bade
the
kind
maddelina
farewell
with
regret
and
after
about
a
fortnightâ€™s
stay
in
tuscany
where
she
had
experienced
an
interval
of
quiet
which
was
absolutely
necessary
to
sustain
her
long-harassed
spirits
began
once
more
to
ascend
the
apennines
from
whose
heights
she
gave
a
long
and
sorrowful
look
to
the
beautiful
country
that
extended
at
their
feet
and
to
the
distant
mediterranean
whose
waves
she
had
so
often
wished
would
bear
her
back
to
france
the
distress
she
felt
on
her
return
towards
the
place
of
her
former
sufferings
was
however
softened
by
a
conjecture
that
valancourt
was
there
and
she
found
some
degree
of
comfort
in
the
thought
of
being
near
him
notwithstanding
the
consideration
that
he
was
probably
a
prisoner
it
was
noon
when
she
had
left
the
cottage
and
the
evening
was
closed
long
before
she
came
within
the
neighbourhood
of
udolpho
there
was
a
moon
but
it
shone
only
at
intervals
for
the
night
was
cloudy
and
lighted
by
the
torch
which
ugo
carried
the
travellers
paced
silently
along
emily
musing
on
her
situation
and
bertrand
and
ugo
anticipating
the
comforts
of
a
flask
of
wine
and
a
good
fire
for
they
had
perceived
for
some
time
the
difference
between
the
warm
climate
of
the
lowlands
of
tuscany
and
the
nipping
air
of
these
upper
regions
emily
was
at
length
roused
from
her
reverie
by
the
far-off
sound
of
the
castle
clock
to
which
she
listened
not
without
some
degree
of
awe
as
it
rolled
away
on
the
breeze
another
and
another
note
succeeded
and
died
in
sullen
murmur
among
the
mountainsâ€”to
her
mournful
imagination
it
seemed
a
knell
measuring
out
some
fateful
period
for
her
â€œaye
there
is
the
old
clockâ€
said
bertrand
â€œthere
he
is
still
the
cannon
have
not
silenced
himâ€
â€œnoâ€
answered
ugo
â€œhe
crowed
as
loud
as
the
best
of
them
in
the
midst
of
it
all
there
he
was
roaring
out
in
the
hottest
fire
i
have
seen
this
many
a
day
i
said
that
some
of
them
would
have
a
hit
at
the
old
fellow
but
he
escaped
and
the
tower
tooâ€
the
road
winding
round
the
base
of
a
mountain
they
now
came
within
view
of
the
castle
which
was
shown
in
the
perspective
of
the
valley
by
a
gleam
of
moonshine
and
then
vanished
in
shade
while
even
a
transient
view
of
it
had
awakened
the
poignancy
of
emilyâ€™s
feelings
its
massy
and
gloomy
walls
gave
her
terrible
ideas
of
imprisonment
and
suffering
yet
as
she
advanced
some
degree
of
hope
mingled
with
her
terror
for
though
this
was
certainly
the
residence
of
montoni
it
was
possibly
also
that
of
valancourt
and
she
could
not
approach
a
place
where
he
might
be
without
experiencing
somewhat
of
the
joy
of
hope
they
continued
to
wind
along
the
valley
and
soon
after
she
saw
again
the
old
walls
and
moonlit
towers
rising
over
the
woods
the
strong
rays
enabled
her
also
to
perceive
the
ravages
which
the
siege
had
madeâ€”with
the
broken
walls
and
shattered
battlements
for
they
were
now
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
on
which
udolpho
stood
massy
fragments
had
rolled
down
among
the
woods
through
which
the
travellers
now
began
to
ascend
and
there
mingled
with
the
loose
earth
and
pieces
of
rock
they
had
brought
with
them
the
woods
too
had
suffered
much
from
the
batteries
above
for
here
the
enemy
had
endeavoured
to
screen
themselves
from
the
fire
of
the
ramparts
many
noble
trees
were
levelled
with
the
ground
and
others
to
a
wide
extent
were
entirely
stripped
of
their
upper
branches
â€œwe
had
better
dismountâ€
said
ugo
â€œand
lead
the
mules
up
the
hill
or
we
shall
get
into
some
of
the
holes
which
the
balls
have
left
here
are
plenty
of
them
give
me
the
torchâ€
continued
ugo
after
they
had
dismounted
â€œand
take
care
you
donâ€™t
stumble
over
anything
that
lies
in
your
way
for
the
ground
is
not
yet
cleared
of
the
enemyâ€
â€œhowâ€
exclaimed
emily
â€œare
any
of
the
enemy
here
thenâ€
â€œnay
i
donâ€™t
know
for
that
nowâ€
he
replied
â€œbut
when
i
came
away
i
saw
one
or
two
of
them
lying
under
the
treesâ€
as
they
proceeded
the
torch
threw
a
gloomy
light
upon
the
ground
and
far
among
the
recesses
of
the
woods
and
emily
feared
to
look
forward
lest
some
object
of
horror
should
meet
her
eye
the
path
was
often
strewn
with
broken
heads
of
arrows
and
with
shattered
remains
of
armour
such
as
at
that
period
was
mingled
with
the
lighter
dress
of
the
soldiers
â€œbring
the
light
hitherâ€
said
bertrand
â€œi
have
stumbled
over
something
that
rattles
loud
enoughâ€
ugo
holding
up
the
torch
they
perceived
a
steel
breastplate
on
the
ground
which
bertrand
raised
and
they
saw
that
it
was
pierced
through
and
that
the
lining
was
entirely
covered
with
blood
but
upon
emilyâ€™s
earnest
entreaties
that
they
would
proceed
bertrand
uttering
some
joke
upon
the
unfortunate
person
to
whom
it
had
belonged
threw
it
hard
upon
the
ground
and
they
passed
on
at
every
step
she
took
emily
feared
to
see
some
vestige
of
death
coming
soon
after
to
an
opening
in
the
woods
bertrand
stopped
to
survey
the
ground
which
was
encumbered
with
massy
trunks
and
branches
of
the
trees
that
had
so
lately
adorned
it
and
seemed
to
have
been
a
spot
particularly
fatal
to
the
besiegers
for
it
was
evident
from
the
destruction
of
the
trees
that
here
the
hottest
fire
of
the
garrison
had
been
directed
as
ugo
held
again
forth
the
torch
steel
glittered
between
the
fallen
trees
the
ground
beneath
was
covered
with
broken
arms
and
with
the
torn
vestments
of
soldiers
whose
mangled
forms
emily
almost
expected
to
see
and
she
again
entreated
her
companions
to
proceed
who
were
however
too
intent
in
their
examination
to
regard
her
and
she
turned
her
eyes
from
this
desolated
scene
to
the
castle
above
where
she
observed
lights
gliding
along
the
ramparts
presently
the
castle
clock
struck
twelve
and
then
a
trumpet
sounded
of
which
emily
enquired
the
occasion
â€œo
they
are
only
changing
watchâ€
replied
ugo
â€œi
do
not
remember
this
trumpetâ€
said
emily
â€œit
is
a
new
customâ€
â€œit
is
only
an
old
one
revived
lady
we
always
use
it
in
time
of
war
we
have
sounded
it
at
midnight
ever
since
the
place
was
besiegedâ€
â€œharkâ€
said
emily
as
the
trumpet
sounded
again
and
in
the
next
moment
she
heard
a
faint
clash
of
arms
and
then
the
watchword
passed
along
the
terrace
above
and
was
answered
from
a
distant
part
of
the
castle
after
which
all
was
again
still
she
complained
of
cold
and
begged
to
go
on
â€œpresently
ladyâ€
said
bertrand
turning
over
some
broken
arms
with
the
pike
he
usually
carried
â€œwhat
have
we
hereâ€
â€œharkâ€
cried
emily
â€œwhat
noise
was
thatâ€
â€œwhat
noise
was
itâ€
said
ugo
starting
up
and
listening
â€œhushâ€
repeated
emily
â€œit
surely
came
from
the
ramparts
aboveâ€
and
on
looking
up
they
perceived
a
light
moving
along
the
walls
while
in
the
next
instant
the
breeze
swelling
the
voice
sounded
louder
than
before
â€œwho
goes
yonderâ€
cried
a
sentinel
of
the
castle
â€œspeak
or
it
will
be
worse
for
youâ€
bertrand
uttered
a
shout
of
joy
â€œhah
my
brave
comrade
is
it
youâ€
said
he
and
he
blew
a
shrill
whistle
which
signal
was
answered
by
another
from
the
soldier
on
watch
and
the
party
then
passing
forward
soon
after
emerged
from
the
woods
upon
the
broken
road
that
led
immediately
to
the
castle
gates
and
emily
saw
with
renewed
terror
the
whole
of
that
stupendous
structure
â€œalasâ€
said
she
to
herself
â€œi
am
going
again
into
my
prisonâ€
â€œhere
has
been
warm
work
by
st
marcoâ€
cried
bertrand
waving
a
torch
over
the
ground
â€œthe
balls
have
torn
up
the
earth
here
with
a
vengeanceâ€
â€œayeâ€
replied
ugo
â€œthey
were
fired
from
that
redoubt
yonder
and
rare
execution
they
did
the
enemy
made
a
furious
attack
upon
the
great
gates
but
they
might
have
guessed
they
could
never
carry
it
there
for
besides
the
cannon
from
the
walls
our
archers
on
the
two
round
towers
showered
down
upon
them
at
such
a
rate
that
by
holy
peter
there
was
no
standing
it
i
never
saw
a
better
sight
in
my
life
i
laughed
till
my
sides
aked
to
see
how
the
knaves
scampered
bertrand
my
good
fellow
thou
shouldst
have
been
among
them
i
warrant
thou
wouldst
have
won
the
raceâ€
â€œhah
you
are
at
your
old
tricks
againâ€
said
bertrand
in
a
surly
tone
â€œit
is
well
for
thee
thou
art
so
near
the
castle
thou
knowest
i
have
killed
my
man
before
nowâ€
ugo
replied
only
by
a
laugh
and
then
gave
some
further
account
of
the
siege
to
which
as
emily
listened
she
was
struck
by
the
strong
contrast
of
the
present
scene
with
that
which
had
so
lately
been
acted
here
the
mingled
uproar
of
cannon
drums
and
trumpets
the
groans
of
the
conquered
and
the
shouts
of
the
conquerors
were
now
sunk
into
a
silence
so
profound
that
it
seemed
as
if
death
had
triumphed
alike
over
the
vanquished
and
the
victor
the
shattered
condition
of
one
of
the
towers
of
the
great
gates
by
no
means
confirmed
the
valiant
account
just
given
by
ugo
of
the
scampering
party
who
it
was
evident
had
not
only
made
a
stand
but
had
done
much
mischief
before
they
took
to
flight
for
this
tower
appeared
as
far
as
emily
could
judge
by
the
dim
moonlight
that
fell
upon
it
to
be
laid
open
and
the
battlements
were
nearly
demolished
while
she
gazed
a
light
glimmered
through
one
of
the
lower
loop-holes
and
disappeared
but
in
the
next
moment
she
perceived
through
the
broken
wall
a
soldier
with
a
lamp
ascending
the
narrow
staircase
that
wound
within
the
tower
and
remembering
that
it
was
the
same
she
had
passed
up
on
the
night
when
barnardine
had
deluded
her
with
a
promise
of
seeing
madame
montoni
fancy
gave
her
somewhat
of
the
terror
she
had
then
suffered
she
was
now
very
near
the
gates
over
which
the
soldier
having
opened
the
door
of
the
portal-chamber
the
lamp
he
carried
gave
her
a
dusky
view
of
that
terrible
apartment
and
she
almost
sunk
under
the
recollected
horrors
of
the
moment
when
she
had
drawn
aside
the
curtain
and
discovered
the
object
it
was
meant
to
conceal
â€œperhapsâ€
said
she
to
herself
â€œit
is
now
used
for
a
similar
purpose
perhaps
that
soldier
goes
at
this
dead
hour
to
watch
over
the
corpse
of
his
friendâ€
the
little
remains
of
her
fortitude
now
gave
way
to
the
united
force
of
remembered
and
anticipated
horrors
for
the
melancholy
fate
of
madame
montoni
appeared
to
foretell
her
own
she
considered
that
though
the
languedoc
estates
if
she
relinquished
them
would
satisfy
montoniâ€™s
avarice
they
might
not
appease
his
vengeance
which
was
seldom
pacified
but
by
a
terrible
sacrifice
and
she
even
thought
that
were
she
to
resign
them
the
fear
of
justice
might
urge
him
either
to
detain
her
a
prisoner
or
to
take
away
her
life
they
were
now
arrived
at
the
gates
where
bertrand
observing
the
light
glimmer
through
a
small
casement
of
the
portal-chamber
called
aloud
and
the
soldier
looking
out
demanded
who
was
there
â€œhere
i
have
brought
you
a
prisonerâ€
said
ugo
â€œopen
the
gate
and
let
us
inâ€
â€œtell
me
first
who
it
is
that
demands
entranceâ€
replied
the
soldier
â€œwhat
my
old
comradeâ€
cried
ugo
â€œdonâ€™t
you
know
me
not
know
ugo
i
have
brought
home
a
prisoner
here
bound
hand
and
footâ€”a
fellow
who
has
been
drinking
tuscany
wine
while
we
here
have
been
fightingâ€
â€œyou
will
not
rest
till
you
meet
with
your
matchâ€
said
bertrand
sullenly
â€œhah
my
comrade
is
it
youâ€
said
the
soldierâ€”â€œiâ€™ll
be
with
you
directlyâ€
emily
presently
heard
his
steps
descending
the
stairs
within
and
then
the
heavy
chain
fall
and
the
bolts
undraw
of
a
small
postern
door
which
he
opened
to
admit
the
party
he
held
the
lamp
low
to
show
the
step
of
the
gate
and
she
found
herself
once
more
beneath
the
gloomy
arch
and
heard
the
door
close
that
seemed
to
shut
her
from
the
world
for
ever
in
the
next
moment
she
was
in
the
first
court
of
the
castle
where
she
surveyed
the
spacious
and
solitary
area
with
a
kind
of
calm
despair
while
the
dead
hour
of
the
night
the
gothic
gloom
of
the
surrounding
buildings
and
the
hollow
and
imperfect
echoes
which
they
returned
as
ugo
and
the
soldier
conversed
together
assisted
to
increase
the
melancholy
forebodings
of
her
heart
passing
on
to
the
second
court
a
distant
sound
broke
feebly
on
the
silence
and
gradually
swelling
louder
as
they
advanced
emily
distinguished
voices
of
revelry
and
laughter
but
they
were
to
her
far
other
than
sounds
of
joy
â€œwhy
you
have
got
some
tuscany
wine
among
you
hereâ€
said
bertrand
â€œif
one
may
judge
by
the
uproar
that
is
going
forward
ugo
has
taken
a
larger
share
of
that
than
of
fighting
iâ€™ll
be
sworn
who
is
carousing
at
this
late
hourâ€
â€œhis
excellenza
and
the
signorsâ€
replied
the
soldier
â€œit
is
a
sign
you
are
a
stranger
at
the
castle
or
you
would
not
need
to
ask
the
question
they
are
brave
spirits
that
do
without
sleepâ€”they
generally
pass
the
night
in
good
cheer
would
that
we
who
keep
the
watch
had
a
little
of
it
it
is
cold
work
pacing
the
ramparts
so
many
hours
of
the
night
if
one
has
no
good
liquor
to
warm
oneâ€™s
heartâ€
â€œcourage
my
lad
courage
ought
to
warm
your
heartâ€
said
ugo
â€œcourageâ€
replied
the
soldier
sharply
with
a
menacing
air
which
ugo
perceiving
prevented
his
saying
more
by
returning
to
the
subject
of
the
carousal
â€œthis
is
a
new
customâ€
said
he
â€œwhen
i
left
the
castle
the
signors
used
to
sit
up
counsellingâ€
â€œaye
and
for
that
matter
carousing
tooâ€
replied
the
soldier
â€œbut
since
the
siege
they
have
done
nothing
but
make
merry
and
if
i
was
they
i
would
settle
accounts
with
myself
for
all
my
hard
fighting
the
same
wayâ€
they
had
now
crossed
the
second
court
and
reached
the
hall
door
when
the
soldier
bidding
them
good
night
hastened
back
to
his
post
and
while
they
waited
for
admittance
emily
considered
how
she
might
avoid
seeing
montoni
and
retire
unnoticed
to
her
former
apartment
for
she
shrunk
from
the
thought
of
encountering
either
him
or
any
of
his
party
at
this
hour
the
uproar
within
the
castle
was
now
so
loud
that
though
ugo
knocked
repeatedly
at
the
hall
door
he
was
not
heard
by
any
of
the
servants
a
circumstance
which
increased
emilyâ€™s
alarm
while
it
allowed
her
time
to
deliberate
on
the
means
of
retiring
unobserved
for
though
she
might
perhaps
pass
up
the
great
staircase
unseen
it
was
impossible
she
could
find
the
way
to
her
chamber
without
a
light
the
difficulty
of
procuring
which
and
the
danger
of
wandering
about
the
castle
without
one
immediately
struck
her
bertrand
had
only
a
torch
and
she
knew
that
the
servants
never
brought
a
taper
to
the
door
for
the
hall
was
sufficiently
lighted
by
the
large
tripod
lamp
which
hung
in
the
vaulted
roof
and
while
she
should
wait
till
annette
could
bring
a
taper
montoni
or
some
of
his
companions
might
discover
her
the
door
was
now
opened
by
carlo
and
emily
having
requested
him
to
send
annette
immediately
with
a
light
to
the
great
gallery
where
she
determined
to
await
her
passed
on
with
hasty
steps
towards
the
staircase
while
bertrand
and
ugo
with
the
torch
followed
old
carlo
to
the
servantsâ€™
hall
impatient
for
supper
and
the
warm
blaze
of
a
wood
fire
emily
lighted
only
by
the
feeble
rays
which
the
lamp
above
threw
between
the
arches
of
this
extensive
hall
endeavoured
to
find
her
way
to
the
staircase
now
hid
in
obscurity
while
the
shouts
of
merriment
that
burst
from
a
remote
apartment
served
by
heightening
her
terror
to
increase
her
perplexity
and
she
expected
every
instant
to
see
the
door
of
that
room
open
and
montoni
and
his
companions
issue
forth
having
at
length
reached
the
staircase
and
found
her
way
to
the
top
she
seated
herself
on
the
last
stair
to
await
the
arrival
of
annette
for
the
profound
darkness
of
the
gallery
deterred
her
from
proceeding
farther
and
while
she
listened
for
her
footstep
she
heard
only
distant
sounds
of
revelry
which
rose
in
sullen
echoes
from
among
the
arcades
below
once
she
thought
she
heard
a
low
sound
from
the
dark
gallery
behind
her
and
turning
her
eyes
fancied
she
saw
something
luminous
move
in
it
and
since
she
could
not
at
this
moment
subdue
the
weakness
that
caused
her
fears
she
quitted
her
seat
and
crept
softly
down
a
few
stairs
lower
annette
not
yet
appearing
emily
now
concluded
that
she
was
gone
to
bed
and
that
nobody
chose
to
call
her
up
and
the
prospect
that
presented
itself
of
passing
the
night
in
darkness
in
this
place
or
in
some
other
equally
forlorn
for
she
knew
it
would
be
impracticable
to
find
her
way
through
the
intricacies
of
the
galleries
to
her
chamber
drew
tears
of
mingled
terror
and
despondency
from
her
eyes
while
thus
she
sat
she
fancied
she
heard
again
an
odd
sound
from
the
gallery
and
she
listened
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
but
the
increasing
voices
below
overcame
every
other
sound
soon
after
she
heard
montoni
and
his
companions
burst
into
the
hall
who
spoke
as
if
they
were
much
intoxicated
and
seemed
to
be
advancing
towards
the
staircase
she
now
remembered
that
they
must
come
this
way
to
their
chambers
and
forgetting
all
the
terrors
of
the
gallery
hurried
towards
it
with
an
intention
of
secreting
herself
in
some
of
the
passages
that
opened
beyond
and
of
endeavouring
when
the
signors
were
retired
to
find
her
way
to
her
own
room
or
to
that
of
annette
which
was
in
a
remote
part
of
the
castle
with
extended
arms
she
crept
along
the
gallery
still
hearing
the
voices
of
persons
below
who
seemed
to
stop
in
conversation
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
then
pausing
for
a
moment
to
listen
half
fearful
of
going
further
into
the
darkness
of
the
gallery
where
she
still
imagined
from
the
noise
she
had
heard
that
some
person
was
lurking
â€œthey
are
already
informed
of
my
arrivalâ€
said
she
â€œand
montoni
is
coming
himself
to
seek
me
in
the
present
state
of
his
mind
his
purpose
must
be
desperateâ€
then
recollecting
the
scene
that
had
passed
in
the
corridor
on
the
night
preceding
her
departure
from
the
castle
â€œo
valancourtâ€
said
she
â€œi
must
then
resign
you
for
ever
to
brave
any
longer
the
injustice
of
montoni
would
not
be
fortitude
but
rashnessâ€
still
the
voices
below
did
not
draw
nearer
but
they
became
louder
and
she
distinguished
those
of
verezzi
and
bertolini
above
the
rest
while
the
few
words
she
caught
made
her
listen
more
anxiously
for
others
the
conversation
seemed
to
concern
herself
and
having
ventured
to
step
a
few
paces
nearer
to
the
staircase
she
discovered
that
they
were
disputing
about
her
each
seeming
to
claim
some
former
promise
of
montoni
who
appeared
at
first
inclined
to
appease
and
to
persuade
them
to
return
to
their
wine
but
afterwards
to
be
weary
of
the
dispute
and
saying
that
he
left
them
to
settle
it
as
they
could
was
returning
with
the
rest
of
the
party
to
the
apartment
he
had
just
quitted
verezzi
then
stopped
him
â€œwhere
is
she
signorâ€
said
he
in
a
voice
of
impatience
â€œtell
us
where
she
isâ€
â€œi
have
already
told
you
that
i
do
not
knowâ€
replied
montoni
who
seemed
to
be
somewhat
overcome
with
wine
â€œbut
she
is
most
probably
gone
to
her
apartmentâ€
verezzi
and
bertolini
now
desisted
from
their
enquiries
and
sprang
to
the
staircase
together
while
emily
who
during
this
discourse
had
trembled
so
excessively
that
she
had
with
difficulty
supported
herself
seemed
inspired
with
new
strength
the
moment
she
heard
the
sound
of
their
steps
and
ran
along
the
gallery
dark
as
it
was
with
the
fleetness
of
a
fawn
but
long
before
she
reached
its
extremity
the
light
which
verezzi
carried
flashed
upon
the
walls
both
appeared
and
instantly
perceiving
emily
pursued
her
at
this
moment
bertolini
whose
steps
though
swift
were
not
steady
and
whose
impatience
overcame
what
little
caution
he
had
hitherto
used
stumbled
and
fell
at
his
length
the
lamp
fell
with
him
and
was
presently
expiring
on
the
floor
but
verezzi
regardless
of
saving
it
seized
the
advantage
this
accident
gave
him
over
his
rival
and
followed
emily
to
whom
however
the
light
had
shown
one
of
the
passages
that
branched
from
the
gallery
and
she
instantly
turned
into
it
verezzi
could
just
discern
the
way
she
had
taken
and
this
he
pursued
but
the
sound
of
her
steps
soon
sunk
in
distance
while
he
less
acquainted
with
the
passage
was
obliged
to
proceed
through
the
dark
with
caution
lest
he
should
fall
down
a
flight
of
steps
such
as
in
this
extensive
old
castle
frequently
terminated
an
avenue
this
passage
at
length
brought
emily
to
the
corridor
into
which
her
own
chamber
opened
and
not
hearing
any
footstep
she
paused
to
take
breath
and
consider
what
was
the
safest
design
to
be
adopted
she
had
followed
this
passage
merely
because
it
was
the
first
that
appeared
and
now
that
she
had
reached
the
end
of
it
was
as
perplexed
as
before
whither
to
go
or
how
further
to
find
her
way
in
the
dark
she
knew
not
she
was
aware
only
that
she
must
not
seek
her
apartment
for
there
she
would
certainly
be
sought
and
her
danger
increased
every
instant
while
she
remained
near
it
her
spirits
and
her
breath
however
were
so
much
exhausted
that
she
was
compelled
to
rest
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
still
she
heard
no
steps
approaching
as
thus
she
stood
light
glimmered
under
an
opposite
door
of
the
gallery
and
from
its
situation
she
knew
that
it
was
the
door
of
that
mysterious
chamber
where
she
had
made
a
discovery
so
shocking
that
she
never
remembered
it
but
with
the
utmost
horror
that
there
should
be
light
in
this
chamber
and
at
this
hour
excited
her
strong
surprise
and
she
felt
a
momentary
terror
concerning
it
which
did
not
permit
her
to
look
again
for
her
spirits
were
now
in
such
a
state
of
weakness
that
she
almost
expected
to
see
the
door
slowly
open
and
some
horrible
object
appear
at
it
still
she
listened
for
a
step
along
the
passage
and
looked
up
it
where
not
a
ray
of
light
appearing
she
concluded
that
verezzi
had
gone
back
for
the
lamp
and
believing
that
he
would
shortly
be
there
she
again
considered
which
way
she
should
go
or
rather
which
way
she
could
find
in
the
dark
a
faint
ray
still
glimmered
under
the
opposite
door
but
so
great
and
perhaps
so
just
was
her
horror
of
that
chamber
that
she
would
not
again
have
tempted
its
secrets
though
she
had
been
certain
of
obtaining
the
light
so
important
to
her
safety
she
was
still
breathing
with
difficulty
and
resting
at
the
end
of
the
passage
when
she
heard
a
rustling
sound
and
then
a
low
voice
so
very
near
her
that
it
seemed
close
to
her
ear
but
she
had
presence
of
mind
to
check
her
emotions
and
to
remain
quite
still
in
the
next
moment
she
perceived
it
to
be
the
voice
of
verezzi
who
did
not
appear
to
know
that
she
was
there
but
to
have
spoken
to
himself
â€œthe
air
is
fresher
hereâ€
said
he
â€œthis
should
be
the
corridorâ€
perhaps
he
was
one
of
those
heroes
whose
courage
can
defy
an
enemy
better
than
darkness
and
he
tried
to
rally
his
spirits
with
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
however
this
might
be
he
turned
to
the
right
and
proceeded
with
the
same
stealing
steps
towards
emilyâ€™s
apartment
apparently
forgetting
that
in
darkness
she
could
easily
elude
his
search
even
in
her
chamber
and
like
an
intoxicated
person
he
followed
pertinaciously
the
one
idea
that
had
possessed
his
imagination
the
moment
she
heard
his
steps
steal
away
she
left
her
station
and
moved
softly
to
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
determined
to
trust
again
to
chance
and
to
quit
it
by
the
first
avenue
she
could
find
but
before
she
could
effect
this
light
broke
upon
the
walls
of
the
gallery
and
looking
back
she
saw
verezzi
crossing
it
towards
her
chamber
she
now
glided
into
a
passage
that
opened
on
the
left
without
as
she
thought
being
perceived
but
in
the
next
instant
another
light
glimmering
at
the
further
end
of
this
passage
threw
her
into
new
terror
while
she
stopped
and
hesitated
which
way
to
go
the
pause
allowed
her
to
perceive
that
it
was
annette
who
advanced
and
she
hurried
to
meet
her
but
her
imprudence
again
alarmed
emily
on
perceiving
whom
she
burst
into
a
scream
of
joy
and
it
was
some
minutes
before
she
could
be
prevailed
with
to
be
silent
or
to
release
her
mistress
from
the
ardent
clasp
in
which
she
held
her
when
at
length
emily
made
annette
comprehend
her
danger
they
hurried
towards
annetteâ€™s
room
which
was
in
a
distant
part
of
the
castle
no
apprehensions
however
could
yet
silence
the
latter
â€œoh
dear
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
she
as
they
passed
along
â€œwhat
a
terrified
time
have
i
had
of
it
oh
i
thought
i
should
have
died
a
hundred
times
i
never
thought
i
should
live
to
see
you
again
and
i
never
was
so
glad
to
see
anybody
in
my
whole
life
as
i
am
to
see
you
nowâ€
â€œharkâ€
cried
emily
â€œwe
are
pursued
that
was
the
echo
of
stepsâ€
â€œno
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œit
was
only
the
echo
of
a
door
shutting
sound
runs
along
these
vaulted
passages
so
that
one
is
continually
deceived
by
it
if
one
does
but
speak
or
cough
it
makes
a
noise
as
loud
as
a
cannonâ€
â€œthen
there
is
the
greater
necessity
for
us
to
be
silentâ€
said
emily
â€œprâ€™ythee
say
no
more
till
we
reach
your
chamberâ€
here
at
length
they
arrived
without
interruption
and
annette
having
fastened
the
door
emily
sat
down
on
her
little
bed
to
recover
breath
and
composure
to
her
enquiry
whether
valancourt
was
among
the
prisoners
in
the
castle
annette
replied
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
hear
but
that
she
knew
there
were
several
persons
confined
she
then
proceeded
in
her
tedious
way
to
give
an
account
of
the
siege
or
rather
a
detail
of
her
terrors
and
various
sufferings
during
the
attack
â€œbutâ€
added
she
â€œwhen
i
heard
the
shouts
of
victory
from
the
ramparts
i
thought
we
were
all
taken
and
gave
myself
up
for
lost
instead
of
which
we
had
driven
the
enemy
away
i
went
then
to
the
north
gallery
and
saw
a
great
many
of
them
scampering
away
among
the
mountains
but
the
rampart
walls
were
all
in
ruins
as
one
may
say
and
there
was
a
dismal
sight
to
see
down
among
the
woods
below
where
the
poor
fellows
were
lying
in
heaps
but
were
carried
off
presently
by
their
comrades
while
the
siege
was
going
on
the
signor
was
here
and
there
and
everywhere
at
the
same
time
as
ludovico
told
me
for
he
would
not
let
me
see
anything
hardly
and
locked
me
up
as
he
has
often
done
before
in
a
room
in
the
middle
of
the
castle
and
used
to
bring
me
food
and
come
and
talk
with
me
as
often
as
he
could
and
i
must
say
if
it
had
not
been
for
ludovico
i
should
have
died
outrightâ€
â€œwell
annetteâ€
said
emily
â€œand
how
have
affairs
gone
on
since
the
siegeâ€
â€œo
sad
hurly-burly
doings
maâ€™amselleâ€
replied
annette
â€œthe
signors
have
done
nothing
but
sit
and
drink
and
game
ever
since
they
sit
up
all
night
and
play
among
themselves
for
all
those
riches
and
fine
things
they
brought
in
some
time
since
when
they
used
to
go
out
a-robbing
or
as
good
for
days
together
and
then
they
have
dreadful
quarrels
about
who
loses
and
who
wins
that
fierce
signor
verezzi
is
always
losing
as
they
tell
me
and
signor
orsino
wins
from
him
and
this
makes
him
very
wroth
and
they
have
had
several
hard
set-toâ€™s
about
it
then
all
those
fine
ladies
are
at
the
castle
still
and
i
declare
i
am
frighted
whenever
i
meet
any
of
them
in
the
passagesâ€”â€
â€œsurely
annetteâ€
said
emily
starting
â€œi
heard
a
noise
listenâ€
after
a
long
pause
â€œno
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
â€œit
was
only
the
wind
in
the
gallery
i
often
hear
it
when
it
shakes
the
old
doors
at
the
other
end
but
wonâ€™t
you
go
to
bed
maâ€™amselle
you
surely
will
not
sit
up
starving
all
nightâ€
emily
now
laid
herself
down
on
the
mattress
and
desired
annette
to
leave
the
lamp
burning
on
the
hearth
having
done
which
the
latter
placed
herself
beside
emily
who
however
was
not
suffered
to
sleep
for
she
again
thought
she
heard
a
noise
from
the
passage
and
annette
was
again
trying
to
convince
her
that
it
was
only
the
wind
when
footsteps
were
distinctly
heard
near
the
door
annette
was
now
starting
from
the
bed
but
emily
prevailed
with
her
to
remain
there
and
listened
with
her
in
a
state
of
terrible
expectation
the
steps
still
loitered
at
the
door
when
presently
an
attempt
was
made
on
the
lock
and
in
the
next
instant
a
voice
called
â€œfor
heavenâ€™s
sake
annette
do
not
answerâ€
said
emily
softly
â€œremain
quite
still
but
i
fear
we
must
extinguish
the
lamp
or
its
glare
will
betray
usâ€
â€œholy
virginâ€
exclaimed
annette
forgetting
her
discretion
â€œi
would
not
be
in
darkness
now
for
the
whole
worldâ€
while
she
spoke
the
voice
became
louder
than
before
and
repeated
annetteâ€™s
name
â€œblessed
virginâ€
cried
she
suddenly
â€œit
is
only
ludovicoâ€
she
rose
to
open
the
door
but
emily
prevented
her
till
they
should
be
more
certain
that
it
was
he
alone
with
whom
annette
at
length
talked
for
some
time
and
learned
that
he
was
come
to
enquire
after
herself
whom
he
had
let
out
of
her
room
to
go
to
emily
and
that
he
was
now
returned
to
lock
her
in
again
emily
fearful
of
being
overheard
if
they
conversed
any
longer
through
the
door
consented
that
it
should
be
opened
and
a
young
man
appeared
whose
open
countenance
confirmed
the
favourable
opinion
of
him
which
his
care
of
annette
had
already
prompted
her
to
form
she
entreated
his
protection
should
verezzi
make
this
requisite
and
ludovico
offered
to
pass
the
night
in
an
old
chamber
adjoining
that
opened
from
the
gallery
and
on
the
first
alarm
to
come
to
their
defence
emily
was
much
soothed
by
this
proposal
and
ludovico
having
lighted
his
lamp
went
to
his
station
while
she
once
more
endeavoured
to
repose
on
her
mattress
but
a
variety
of
interests
pressed
upon
her
attention
and
prevented
sleep
she
thought
much
on
what
annette
had
told
her
of
the
dissolute
manners
of
montoni
and
his
associates
and
more
of
his
present
conduct
towards
herself
and
of
the
danger
from
which
she
had
just
escaped
from
the
view
of
her
present
situation
she
shrunk
as
from
a
new
picture
of
terror
she
saw
herself
in
a
castle
inhabited
by
vice
and
violence
seated
beyond
the
reach
of
law
or
justice
and
in
the
power
of
a
man
whose
perseverance
was
equal
to
every
occasion
and
in
whom
passions
of
which
revenge
was
not
the
weakest
entirely
supplied
the
place
of
principles
she
was
compelled
once
more
to
acknowledge
that
it
would
be
folly
and
not
fortitude
any
longer
to
dare
his
power
and
resigning
all
hopes
of
future
happiness
with
valancourt
she
determined
that
on
the
following
morning
she
would
compromise
with
montoni
and
give
up
her
estates
on
condition
that
he
would
permit
her
immediate
return
to
france
such
considerations
kept
her
waking
for
many
hours
but
the
night
passed
without
further
alarm
from
verezzi
on
the
next
morning
emily
had
a
long
conversation
with
ludovico
in
which
she
heard
circumstances
concerning
the
castle
and
received
hints
of
the
designs
of
montoni
that
considerably
increased
her
alarms
on
expressing
her
surprise
that
ludovico
who
seemed
to
be
so
sensible
of
the
evils
of
his
situation
should
continue
in
it
he
informed
her
that
it
was
not
his
intention
to
do
so
and
she
then
ventured
to
ask
him
if
he
would
assist
her
to
escape
from
the
castle
ludovico
assured
her
of
his
readiness
to
attempt
this
but
strongly
represented
the
difficulty
of
the
enterprise
and
the
certain
destruction
which
must
ensue
should
montoni
overtake
them
before
they
had
passed
the
mountains
he
however
promised
to
be
watchful
of
every
circumstance
that
might
contribute
to
the
success
of
the
attempt
and
to
think
upon
some
plan
of
departure
emily
now
confided
to
him
the
name
of
valancourt
and
begged
he
would
enquire
for
such
a
person
among
the
prisoners
in
the
castle
for
the
faint
hope
which
this
conversation
awakened
made
her
now
recede
from
her
resolution
of
an
immediate
compromise
with
montoni
she
determined
if
possible
to
delay
this
till
she
heard
further
from
ludovico
and
if
his
designs
were
found
to
be
impracticable
to
resign
the
estates
at
once
her
thoughts
were
on
this
subject
when
montoni
who
was
now
recovered
from
the
intoxication
of
the
preceding
night
sent
for
her
and
she
immediately
obeyed
the
summons
he
was
alone
â€œi
findâ€
said
he
â€œthat
you
were
not
in
your
chamber
last
night
where
were
youâ€
emily
related
to
him
some
circumstances
of
her
alarm
and
entreated
his
protection
from
a
repetition
of
them
â€œyou
know
the
terms
of
my
protectionâ€
said
he
â€œif
you
really
value
this
you
will
secure
itâ€
his
open
declaration
that
he
would
only
conditionally
protect
her
while
she
remained
a
prisoner
in
the
castle
showed
emily
the
necessity
of
an
immediate
compliance
with
his
terms
but
she
first
demanded
whether
he
would
permit
her
immediately
to
depart
if
she
gave
up
her
claim
to
the
contested
estates
in
a
very
solemn
manner
he
then
assured
her
that
he
would
and
immediately
laid
before
her
a
paper
which
was
to
transfer
the
right
of
those
estates
to
himself
she
was
for
a
considerable
time
unable
to
sign
it
and
her
heart
was
torn
with
contending
interests
for
she
was
about
to
resign
the
happiness
of
all
her
future
yearsâ€”the
hope
which
had
sustained
her
in
so
many
hours
of
adversity
after
hearing
from
montoni
a
recapitulation
of
the
conditions
of
her
compliance
and
a
remonstrance
that
his
time
was
valuable
she
put
her
hand
to
the
paper
when
she
had
done
which
she
fell
back
in
her
chair
but
soon
recovered
and
desired
that
he
would
give
orders
for
her
departure
and
that
he
would
allow
annette
to
accompany
her
montoni
smiled
â€œit
was
necessary
to
deceive
youâ€
said
heâ€”â€œthere
was
no
other
way
of
making
you
act
reasonably
you
shall
go
but
it
must
not
be
at
present
i
must
first
secure
these
estates
by
possession
when
that
is
done
you
may
return
to
france
if
you
willâ€
the
deliberate
villany
with
which
he
violated
the
solemn
engagement
he
had
just
entered
into
shocked
emily
as
much
as
the
certainty
that
she
had
made
a
fruitless
sacrifice
and
must
still
remain
his
prisoner
she
had
no
words
to
express
what
she
felt
and
knew
that
it
would
have
been
useless
if
she
had
as
she
looked
piteously
at
montoni
he
turned
away
and
at
the
same
time
desired
she
would
withdraw
to
her
apartment
but
unable
to
leave
the
room
she
sat
down
in
a
chair
near
the
door
and
sighed
heavily
she
had
neither
words
nor
tears
â€œwhy
will
you
indulge
this
childish
griefâ€
said
he
â€œendeavour
to
strengthen
your
mind
to
bear
patiently
what
cannot
now
be
avoided
you
have
no
real
evil
to
lament
be
patient
and
you
will
be
sent
back
to
france
at
present
retire
to
your
apartmentâ€
â€œi
dare
not
go
sirâ€
said
she
â€œwhere
i
shall
be
liable
to
the
intrusion
of
signor
verezziâ€
â€œhave
i
not
promised
to
protect
youâ€
said
montoni
â€œyou
have
promised
sirâ€â€”replied
emily
after
some
hesitation
â€œand
is
not
my
promise
sufficientâ€
added
he
sternly
â€œyou
will
recollect
your
former
promise
signorâ€
said
emily
trembling
â€œand
may
determine
for
me
whether
i
ought
to
rely
upon
thisâ€
â€œwill
you
provoke
me
to
declare
to
you
that
i
will
not
protect
you
thenâ€
said
montoni
in
a
tone
of
haughty
displeasure
â€œif
that
will
satisfy
you
i
will
do
it
immediately
withdraw
to
your
chamber
before
i
retract
my
promise
you
have
nothing
to
fear
thereâ€
emily
left
the
room
and
moved
slowly
into
the
hall
where
the
fear
of
meeting
verezzi
or
bertolini
made
her
quicken
her
steps
though
she
could
scarcely
support
herself
and
soon
after
she
reached
once
more
her
own
apartment
having
looked
fearfully
round
her
to
examine
if
any
person
was
there
and
having
searched
every
part
of
it
she
fastened
the
door
and
sat
down
by
one
of
the
casements
here
while
she
looked
out
for
some
hope
to
support
her
fainting
spirits
which
had
been
so
long
harassed
and
oppressed
that
if
she
had
not
now
struggled
much
against
misfortune
they
would
have
left
her
perhaps
for
ever
she
endeavoured
to
believe
that
montoni
did
really
intend
to
permit
her
return
to
france
as
soon
as
he
had
secured
her
property
and
that
he
would
in
the
mean
time
protect
her
from
insult
but
her
chief
hope
rested
with
ludovico
who
she
doubted
not
would
be
zealous
in
her
cause
though
he
seemed
almost
to
despair
of
success
in
it
one
circumstance
however
she
had
to
rejoice
in
her
prudence
or
rather
her
fears
had
saved
her
from
mentioning
the
name
of
valancourt
to
montoni
which
she
was
several
times
on
the
point
of
doing
before
she
signed
the
paper
and
of
stipulating
for
his
release
if
he
should
be
really
a
prisoner
in
the
castle
had
she
done
this
montoniâ€™s
jealous
fears
would
now
probably
have
loaded
valancourt
with
new
severities
and
have
suggested
the
advantage
of
holding
him
a
captive
for
life
thus
passed
the
melancholy
day
as
she
had
before
passed
many
in
this
same
chamber
when
night
drew
on
she
would
have
withdrawn
herself
to
annetteâ€™s
bed
had
not
a
particular
interest
inclined
her
to
remain
in
this
chamber
in
spite
of
her
fears
for
when
the
castle
should
be
still
and
the
customary
hour
arrived
she
determined
to
watch
for
the
music
which
she
had
formerly
heard
though
its
sounds
might
not
enable
her
positively
to
determine
whether
valancourt
was
there
they
would
perhaps
strengthen
her
opinion
that
he
was
and
impart
the
comfort
so
necessary
to
her
present
support
but
on
the
other
hand
if
all
should
be
silent
she
hardly
dared
to
suffer
her
thoughts
to
glance
that
way
but
waited
with
impatient
expectation
the
approaching
hour
the
night
was
stormy
the
battlements
of
the
castle
appeared
to
rock
in
the
wind
and
at
intervals
long
groans
seemed
to
pass
on
the
air
such
as
those
which
often
deceive
the
melancholy
mind
in
tempests
and
amidst
scenes
of
desolation
emily
heard
as
formerly
the
sentinels
pass
along
the
terrace
to
their
posts
and
looking
out
from
her
casement
observed
that
the
watch
was
doubled
a
precaution
which
appeared
necessary
enough
when
she
threw
her
eyes
on
the
walls
and
saw
their
shattered
condition
the
well-known
sounds
of
the
soldiersâ€™
march
and
of
their
distant
voices
which
passed
her
in
the
wind
and
were
lost
again
recalled
to
her
memory
the
melancholy
sensation
she
had
suffered
when
she
formerly
heard
the
same
sounds
and
occasioned
almost
involuntary
comparisons
between
her
present
and
her
late
situation
but
this
was
no
subject
for
congratulations
and
she
wisely
checked
the
course
of
her
thoughts
while
as
the
hour
was
not
yet
come
in
which
she
had
been
accustomed
to
hear
the
music
she
closed
the
casement
and
endeavoured
to
await
it
in
patience
the
door
of
the
staircase
she
tried
to
secure
as
usual
with
some
of
the
furniture
of
the
room
but
this
expedient
her
fears
now
represented
to
her
to
be
very
inadequate
to
the
power
and
perseverance
of
verezzi
and
she
often
looked
at
a
large
and
heavy
chest
that
stood
in
the
chamber
with
wishes
that
she
and
annette
had
strength
enough
to
move
it
while
she
blamed
the
long
stay
of
this
girl
who
was
still
with
ludovico
and
some
other
of
the
servants
she
trimmed
her
wood
fire
to
make
the
room
appear
less
desolate
and
sat
down
beside
it
with
a
book
which
her
eyes
perused
while
her
thoughts
wandered
to
valancourt
and
her
own
misfortunes
as
she
sat
thus
she
thought
in
a
pause
of
the
wind
she
distinguished
music
and
went
to
the
casement
to
listen
but
the
loud
swell
of
the
gust
overcame
every
other
sound
when
the
wind
sunk
again
she
heard
distinctly
in
the
deep
pause
that
succeeded
the
sweet
strings
of
a
lute
but
again
the
rising
tempest
bore
away
the
notes
and
again
was
succeeded
by
a
solemn
pause
emily
trembling
with
hope
and
fear
opened
her
casement
to
listen
and
to
try
whether
her
own
voice
could
be
heard
by
the
musician
for
to
endure
any
longer
this
state
of
torturing
suspense
concerning
valancourt
seemed
to
be
utterly
impossible
there
was
a
kind
of
breathless
stillness
in
the
chambers
that
permitted
her
to
distinguish
from
below
the
tender
notes
of
the
very
lute
she
had
formerly
heard
and
with
it
a
plaintive
voice
made
sweeter
by
the
low
rustling
sound
that
now
began
to
creep
along
the
wood-tops
till
it
was
lost
in
the
rising
wind
their
tall
heads
then
began
to
wave
while
through
a
forest
of
pine
on
the
left
the
wind
groaning
heavily
rolled
onward
over
the
woods
below
bending
them
almost
to
their
roots
and
as
the
long-resounding
gale
swept
away
other
woods
on
the
right
seemed
to
answer
the
â€œloud
lamentâ€
then
others
further
still
softened
it
into
a
murmur
that
died
into
silence
emily
listened
with
mingled
awe
and
expectation
hope
and
fear
and
again
the
melting
sweetness
of
the
lute
was
heard
and
the
same
solemn-breathing
voice
convinced
that
these
came
from
an
apartment
underneath
she
leaned
far
out
of
her
window
that
she
might
discover
whether
any
light
was
there
but
the
casements
below
as
well
as
those
above
were
sunk
so
deep
in
the
thick
walls
of
the
castle
that
she
could
not
see
them
or
even
the
faint
ray
that
probably
glimmered
through
their
bars
she
then
ventured
to
call
but
the
wind
bore
her
voice
to
the
other
end
of
the
terrace
and
then
the
music
was
heard
as
before
in
the
pause
of
the
gust
suddenly
she
thought
she
heard
a
noise
in
her
chamber
and
she
drew
herself
within
the
casement
but
in
a
moment
after
distinguishing
annetteâ€™s
voice
at
the
door
she
concluded
it
was
her
she
had
heard
before
and
she
let
her
in
â€œmove
softly
annette
to
the
casementâ€
said
she
â€œand
listen
with
me
the
music
is
returnedâ€
they
were
silent
till
the
measure
changing
annette
exclaimed
â€œholy
virgin
i
know
that
song
well
it
is
a
french
song
one
of
the
favourite
songs
of
my
dear
countryâ€
this
was
the
ballad
emily
had
heard
on
a
former
night
though
not
the
one
she
had
first
listened
to
from
the
fishing-house
in
gascony
â€œo
it
is
a
frenchman
that
singsâ€
said
annette
â€œit
must
be
monsieur
valancourtâ€
â€œhark
annette
do
not
speak
so
loudâ€
said
emily
â€œwe
may
be
overheardâ€
â€œwhat
by
the
chevalierâ€
said
annette
â€œnoâ€
replied
emily
mournfully
â€œbut
by
somebody
who
may
report
us
to
the
signor
what
reason
have
you
to
think
it
is
monsieur
valancourt
who
sings
but
hark
now
the
voice
swells
louder
do
you
recollect
those
tones
i
fear
to
trust
my
own
judgmentâ€
â€œi
never
happened
to
hear
the
chevalier
sing
mademoiselleâ€
replied
annette
who
as
emily
was
disappointed
to
perceive
had
no
stronger
reason
for
concluding
this
to
be
valancourt
than
that
the
musician
must
be
a
frenchman
soon
after
she
heard
the
song
of
the
fishing-house
and
distinguished
her
own
name
which
was
repeated
so
distinctly
that
annette
had
heard
it
also
she
trembled
sunk
into
a
chair
by
the
window
and
annette
called
aloud
â€œmonsieur
valancourt
monsieur
valancourtâ€
while
emily
endeavoured
to
check
her
but
she
repeated
the
call
more
loudly
than
before
and
the
lute
and
the
voice
suddenly
stopped
emily
listened
for
some
time
in
a
state
of
intolerable
suspense
but
no
answer
being
returned
â€œit
does
not
signify
mademoiselleâ€
said
annette
â€œit
is
the
chevalier
and
i
will
speak
to
himâ€
â€œno
annetteâ€
said
emily
â€œi
think
i
will
speak
myself
if
it
is
he
he
will
know
my
voice
and
speak
againâ€
â€œwho
is
itâ€
said
she
â€œthat
sings
at
this
late
hourâ€
a
long
silence
ensued
and
having
repeated
the
question
she
perceived
some
faint
accents
mingling
in
the
blast
that
swept
by
but
the
sounds
were
so
distant
and
passed
so
suddenly
that
she
could
scarcely
hear
them
much
less
distinguish
the
words
they
uttered
or
recognise
the
voice
after
another
pause
emily
called
again
and
again
they
heard
a
voice
but
as
faintly
as
before
and
they
perceived
that
there
were
other
circumstances
besides
the
strength
and
direction
of
the
wind
to
content
with
for
the
great
depth
at
which
the
casements
were
fixed
in
the
castle
walls
contributed
still
more
than
the
distance
to
prevent
articulated
sounds
from
being
understood
though
general
ones
were
easily
heard
emily
however
ventured
to
believe
from
the
circumstance
of
her
voice
alone
having
been
answered
that
the
stranger
was
valancourt
as
well
as
that
he
knew
her
and
she
gave
herself
up
to
speechless
joy
annette
however
was
not
speechless
she
renewed
her
calls
but
received
no
answer
and
emily
fearing
that
a
further
attempt
which
certainly
was
as
present
highly
dangerous
might
expose
them
to
the
guards
of
the
castle
while
it
could
not
perhaps
terminate
her
suspense
insisted
on
annetteâ€™s
dropping
the
enquiry
for
this
night
though
she
determined
herself
to
question
ludovico
on
the
subject
in
the
morning
more
urgently
than
she
had
yet
done
she
was
now
enabled
to
say
that
the
stranger
whom
she
had
formerly
heard
was
still
in
the
castle
and
to
direct
ludovico
to
that
part
of
it
in
which
he
was
confined
emily
attended
by
annette
continued
at
the
casement
for
some
time
but
all
remained
still
they
heard
neither
lute
nor
voice
again
and
emily
was
now
as
much
oppressed
by
anxious
joy
as
she
lately
was
by
a
sense
of
her
misfortunes
with
hasty
steps
she
paced
the
room
now
half
calling
on
valancourtâ€™s
name
then
suddenly
stopping
and
now
going
to
the
casement
and
listening
where
however
she
heard
nothing
but
the
solemn
waving
of
the
woods
sometimes
her
impatience
to
speak
to
ludovico
prompted
her
to
send
annette
to
call
him
but
a
sense
of
the
impropriety
of
this
at
midnight
restrained
her
annette
meanwhile
as
impatient
as
her
mistress
went
as
often
to
the
casement
to
listen
and
returned
almost
as
much
disappointed
she
at
length
mentioned
signor
verezzi
and
her
fear
lest
he
should
enter
the
chamber
by
the
staircase
door
â€œbut
the
night
is
now
almost
past
mademoiselleâ€
said
she
recollecting
herself
â€œthere
is
the
morning
light
beginning
to
peep
over
those
mountains
yonder
in
the
eastâ€
emily
had
forgotten
till
this
moment
that
such
a
person
existed
as
verezzi
and
all
the
danger
that
had
appeared
to
threaten
her
but
the
mention
of
his
name
renewed
her
alarm
and
she
remembered
the
old
chest
that
she
had
wished
to
place
against
the
door
which
she
now
with
annette
attempted
to
move
but
it
was
so
heavy
that
they
could
not
lift
it
from
the
floor
â€œwhat
is
in
this
great
old
chest
mademoiselleâ€
said
annette
â€œthat
makes
it
so
weightyâ€
emily
having
replied
â€œthat
she
found
it
in
the
chamber
when
she
first
came
to
the
castle
and
had
never
examined
itâ€â€”â€œthen
i
will
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
annette
and
she
tried
to
lift
the
lid
but
this
was
held
by
a
lock
for
which
she
had
no
key
and
which
indeed
appeared
from
its
peculiar
construction
to
open
with
a
spring
the
morning
now
glimmered
through
the
casements
and
the
wind
had
sunk
into
a
calm
emily
looked
out
upon
the
dusky
woods
and
on
the
twilight
mountains
just
stealing
in
the
eye
and
saw
the
whole
scene
after
the
storm
lying
in
profound
stillness
the
woods
motionless
and
the
clouds
above
through
which
the
dawn
trembled
scarcely
appearing
to
move
along
the
heavens
one
soldier
was
pacing
the
terrace
beneath
with
measured
steps
and
two
more
distant
were
sunk
asleep
on
the
walls
wearied
with
the
nightâ€™s
watch
having
inhaled
for
a
while
the
pure
spirit
of
the
air
and
of
vegetation
which
the
late
rains
had
called
forth
and
having
listened
once
more
for
a
note
of
music
she
now
closed
the
casement
and
retired
to
rest
thus
on
the
chill
lapponianâ€™s
dreary
land
for
many
a
long
month
lost
in
snow
profound
when
sol
from
cancer
sends
the
seasons
bland
and
in
their
northern
cave
the
storms
hath
bound
from
silent
mountains
straight
with
startling
sound
torrents
are
hurlâ€™d
green
hills
emerge
and
lo
the
trees
with
foliage
cliffs
with
flowers
are
crownâ€™d
pure
rills
through
vales
of
verdure
warbling
go
and
wonder
love
and
joy
the
peasantâ€™s
heart
oâ€™erflow
beattie
several
of
her
succeeding
days
passed
in
suspense
for
ludovico
could
only
learn
from
the
soldiers
that
there
was
a
prisoner
in
the
apartment
described
to
him
by
emily
and
that
he
was
a
frenchman
whom
they
had
taken
in
one
of
their
skirmishes
with
a
party
of
his
countrymen
during
this
interval
emily
escaped
the
persecutions
of
bertolini
and
verezzi
by
confining
herself
to
her
apartment
except
that
sometimes
in
an
evening
she
ventured
to
walk
in
the
adjoining
corridor
montoni
appeared
to
respect
his
last
promise
though
he
had
prophaned
his
first
for
to
his
protection
only
could
she
attribute
her
present
repose
and
in
this
she
was
now
so
secure
that
she
did
not
wish
to
leave
the
castle
till
she
could
obtain
some
certainty
concerning
valancourt
for
which
she
waited
indeed
without
any
sacrifice
of
her
own
comfort
since
no
circumstance
had
occurred
to
make
her
escape
probable
on
the
fourth
day
ludovico
informed
her
that
he
had
hopes
of
being
admitted
to
the
presence
of
the
prisoner
it
being
the
turn
of
a
soldier
with
whom
he
had
been
for
some
time
familiar
to
attend
him
on
the
following
night
he
was
not
deceived
in
his
hope
for
under
pretence
of
carrying
in
a
pitcher
of
water
he
entered
the
prison
though
his
prudence
having
prevented
him
from
telling
the
sentinel
the
real
motive
of
his
visit
he
was
obliged
to
make
his
conference
with
the
prisoner
a
very
short
one
emily
awaited
the
result
in
her
own
apartment
ludovico
having
promised
to
accompany
annette
to
the
corridor
in
the
evening
where
after
several
hours
impatiently
counted
he
arrived
emily
having
then
uttered
the
name
of
valancourt
could
articulate
no
more
but
hesitated
in
trembling
expectation
â€œthe
chevalier
would
not
entrust
me
with
his
name
signoraâ€
replied
ludovico
â€œbut
when
i
just
mentioned
yours
he
seemed
overwhelmed
with
joy
though
he
was
not
so
much
surprised
as
i
expectedâ€
â€œdoes
he
then
remember
meâ€
she
exclaimed
â€œo
it
is
mons
valancourtâ€
said
annette
and
looked
impatiently
at
ludovico
who
understood
her
look
and
replied
to
emily
â€œyes
lady
the
chevalier
does
indeed
remember
you
and
i
am
sure
has
a
very
great
regard
for
you
and
i
made
bold
to
say
you
had
for
him
he
then
enquired
how
you
came
to
know
he
was
in
the
castle
and
whether
you
ordered
me
to
speak
to
him
the
first
question
i
could
not
answer
but
the
second
i
did
and
then
he
went
off
into
his
ecstasies
again
i
was
afraid
his
joy
would
have
betrayed
him
to
the
sentinel
at
the
doorâ€
â€œbut
how
does
he
look
ludovicoâ€
interrupted
emily
â€œis
he
not
melancholy
and
ill
with
this
long
confinementâ€â€”â€œwhy
as
to
melancholy
i
saw
no
symptom
of
that
lady
while
i
was
with
him
for
he
seemed
in
the
finest
spirits
i
ever
saw
anybody
in
in
all
my
life
his
countenance
was
all
joy
and
if
one
may
judge
from
that
he
was
very
well
but
i
did
not
ask
himâ€
â€œdid
he
send
me
no
messageâ€
said
emily
â€œo
yes
signora
and
something
besidesâ€
replied
ludovico
who
searched
his
pockets
â€œsurely
i
have
not
lost
itâ€
added
he
â€œthe
chevalier
said
he
would
have
written
madam
if
he
had
had
pen
and
ink
and
was
going
to
have
sent
a
very
long
message
when
the
sentinel
entered
the
room
but
not
before
he
had
give
me
thisâ€
ludovico
then
drew
forth
a
miniature
from
his
bosom
which
emily
received
with
a
trembling
hand
and
perceived
to
be
a
portrait
of
herselfâ€”the
very
picture
which
her
mother
had
lost
so
strangely
in
the
fishing-house
at
la
vallã©e
tears
of
mingled
joy
and
tenderness
flowed
to
her
eyes
while
ludovico
proceededâ€”â€œâ€˜tell
your
ladyâ€™
said
the
chevalier
as
he
gave
me
the
picture
â€˜that
this
has
been
my
companion
and
only
solace
in
all
my
misfortunes
tell
her
that
i
have
worn
it
next
my
heart
and
that
i
sent
it
her
as
the
pledge
of
an
affection
which
can
never
die
that
i
would
not
part
with
it
but
to
her
for
the
wealth
of
worlds
and
that
i
now
part
with
it
only
in
the
hope
of
soon
receiving
it
from
her
hands
tell
herâ€”â€™
just
then
signora
the
sentinel
came
in
and
the
chevalier
said
no
more
but
he
had
before
asked
me
to
contrive
an
interview
for
him
with
you
and
when
i
told
him
how
little
hope
i
had
of
prevailing
with
the
guard
to
assist
me
he
said
that
was
not
perhaps
of
so
much
consequence
as
i
imagined
and
bade
me
contrive
to
bring
back
your
answer
and
he
would
inform
me
of
more
than
he
chose
to
do
then
so
this
i
think
lady
is
the
whole
of
what
passedâ€
â€œhow
ludovico
shall
i
reward
you
for
your
zealâ€
said
emily
â€œbut
indeed
i
do
not
now
possess
the
means
when
can
you
see
the
chevalier
againâ€
â€œthat
is
uncertain
signoraâ€
replied
he
â€œit
depends
upon
who
stands
guard
next
there
are
not
more
than
one
or
two
among
them
from
whom
i
would
dare
to
ask
admittance
to
the
prison-chamberâ€
â€œi
need
not
bid
you
remember
ludovicoâ€
resumed
emily
â€œhow
very
much
interested
i
am
in
your
seeing
the
chevalier
soon
and
when
you
do
so
tell
him
that
i
have
received
the
picture
and
with
the
sentiments
he
wished
tell
him
i
have
suffered
much
and
still
sufferâ€”â€
she
paused
â€œbut
shall
i
tell
him
you
will
see
him
ladyâ€
said
ludovico
â€œmost
certainly
i
willâ€
replied
emily
â€œbut
when
signora
and
whereâ€
â€œthat
must
depend
upon
circumstancesâ€
returned
emily
â€œthe
place
and
the
hour
must
be
regulated
by
his
opportunitiesâ€
â€œas
to
the
place
mademoiselleâ€
said
annette
â€œthere
is
no
other
place
in
the
castle
besides
this
corridor
where
we
can
see
him
in
safety
you
know
and
as
for
the
hourâ€”it
must
be
when
all
the
signors
are
asleep
if
that
ever
happensâ€
â€œyou
may
mention
these
circumstances
to
the
chevalier
ludovicoâ€
said
she
checking
the
flippancy
of
annette
â€œand
leave
them
to
his
judgment
and
opportunity
tell
him
my
heart
is
unchanged
but
above
all
let
him
see
you
again
as
soon
as
possible
and
ludovico
i
think
it
is
needless
to
tell
you
i
shall
very
anxiously
look
for
youâ€
having
then
wished
her
good
night
ludovico
descended
the
staircase
and
emily
retired
to
rest
but
not
to
sleep
for
joy
now
rendered
her
as
wakeful
as
she
had
ever
been
from
grief
montoni
and
his
castle
had
all
vanished
from
her
mind
like
the
frightful
vision
of
a
necromancer
and
she
wandered
once
more
in
fairy
scenes
of
unfading
happiness
as
when
beneath
the
beam
of
summer
moons
the
distant
woods
among
or
by
some
flood
all
silverâ€™d
with
the
gleam
the
soft
embodied
fays
throâ€™
airy
portals
stream
a
week
elapsed
before
ludovico
again
visited
the
prison
for
the
sentinels
during
that
period
were
men
in
whom
he
could
not
confide
and
he
feared
to
awaken
curiosity
by
asking
to
see
their
prisoner
in
this
interval
he
communicated
to
emily
terrific
reports
of
what
was
passing
in
the
castle
of
riots
quarrels
and
of
carousals
more
alarming
than
either
while
from
some
circumstances
which
he
mentioned
she
not
only
doubted
whether
montoni
meant
ever
to
release
her
but
greatly
feared
that
he
had
designs
concerning
herâ€”such
as
she
had
formerly
dreaded
her
name
was
frequently
mentioned
in
the
conversations
which
bertolini
and
verezzi
held
together
and
at
those
times
they
were
frequently
in
contention
montoni
had
lost
large
sums
to
verezzi
so
that
there
was
a
dreadful
possibility
of
his
designing
her
to
be
a
substitute
for
the
debt
but
as
she
was
ignorant
that
he
had
formerly
encouraged
the
hopes
of
bertolini
also
concerning
herself
after
the
latter
had
done
him
some
signal
service
she
knew
not
how
to
account
for
these
contentions
between
bertolini
and
verezzi
the
cause
of
them
however
appeared
to
be
of
little
consequence
for
she
thought
she
saw
destruction
approaching
in
many
forms
and
her
entreaties
to
ludovico
to
contrive
an
escape
and
to
see
the
prisoner
again
were
more
urgent
than
ever
at
length
he
informed
her
that
he
had
again
visited
the
chevalier
who
had
directed
him
to
confide
in
the
guard
of
the
prison
from
whom
he
had
already
received
some
instances
of
kindness
and
who
had
promised
to
permit
his
going
into
the
castle
for
half
an
hour
on
the
ensuing
night
when
montoni
and
his
companions
should
be
engaged
at
their
carousals
â€œthis
was
kind
to
be
sureâ€
added
ludovico
â€œbut
sebastian
knows
he
runs
no
risk
in
letting
the
chevalier
out
for
if
he
can
get
beyond
the
bars
and
iron
doors
of
the
castle
he
must
be
cunning
indeed
but
the
chevalier
desired
me
signora
to
go
to
you
immediately
and
to
beg
you
would
allow
him
to
visit
you
this
night
if
it
was
only
for
a
moment
for
that
he
could
no
longer
live
under
the
same
roof
without
seeing
you
the
hour
he
said
he
could
not
mention
for
it
must
depend
on
circumstances
just
as
you
said
signora
and
the
place
he
desired
you
would
appoint
as
knowing
which
was
best
for
your
own
safetyâ€
emily
was
now
so
much
agitated
by
the
near
prospect
of
meeting
valancourt
that
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
give
any
answer
to
ludovico
or
consider
of
the
place
of
meeting
when
she
did
she
saw
none
that
promised
so
much
security
as
the
corridor
near
her
own
apartment
which
she
was
checked
from
leaving
by
the
apprehension
of
meeting
any
of
montoniâ€™s
guests
on
their
way
to
their
rooms
and
she
dismissed
the
scruples
which
delicacy
opposed
now
that
a
serious
danger
was
to
be
avoided
by
encountering
them
it
was
settled
therefore
that
the
chevalier
should
meet
her
in
the
corridor
at
that
hour
of
the
night
which
ludovico
who
was
to
be
upon
the
watch
should
judge
safest
and
emily
as
may
be
imagined
passed
this
interval
in
a
tumult
of
hope
and
joy
anxiety
and
impatience
never
since
her
residence
in
the
castle
had
she
watched
with
so
much
pleasure
the
sun
set
behind
the
mountains
and
twilight
shade
and
darkness
veil
the
scene
as
on
this
evening
she
counted
the
notes
of
the
great
clock
and
listened
to
the
steps
of
the
sentinels
as
they
changed
the
watch
only
to
rejoice
that
another
hour
was
gone
â€œo
valancourtâ€
said
she
â€œafter
all
i
have
suffered
after
our
long
long
separation
when
i
thought
i
should
neverâ€”never
see
you
moreâ€”we
are
still
to
meet
again
o
i
have
endured
grief
and
anxiety
and
terror
and
let
me
then
not
sink
beneath
this
joyâ€
these
were
moments
when
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
feel
emotions
of
regret
or
melancholy
for
any
ordinary
interestsâ€”even
the
reflection
that
she
had
resigned
the
estates
which
would
have
been
a
provision
for
herself
and
valancourt
for
life
threw
only
a
light
and
transient
shade
upon
her
spirits
the
idea
of
valancourt
and
that
she
should
see
him
so
soon
alone
occupied
her
heart
at
length
the
clock
struck
twelve
she
opened
the
door
to
listen
if
any
noise
was
in
the
castle
and
heard
only
distant
shouts
of
riot
and
laughter
echoed
feebly
along
the
gallery
she
guessed
that
the
signor
and
his
guests
were
at
the
banquet
â€œthey
are
now
engaged
for
the
nightâ€
said
she
â€œand
valancourt
will
soon
be
hereâ€
having
softly
closed
the
door
she
paced
the
room
with
impatient
steps
and
often
went
to
the
casement
to
listen
for
the
lute
but
all
was
silent
and
her
agitation
every
moment
increasing
she
was
at
length
unable
to
support
herself
and
sat
down
by
the
window
annette
whom
she
detained
was
in
the
meantime
as
loquacious
as
usual
but
emily
heard
scarcely
anything
she
said
and
having
at
length
risen
to
the
casement
she
distinguished
the
chords
of
the
lute
struck
with
an
expressive
hand
and
then
the
voice
she
had
formerly
listened
to
accompanied
it
now
rising
love
they
fannâ€™d
now
pleasing
dole
they
breathâ€™d
in
tender
musings
through
the
heart
and
now
a
graver
sacred
strain
they
stole
as
when
seraphic
hands
a
hymn
impart
emily
wept
in
doubtful
joy
and
tenderness
and
when
the
strain
ceased
she
considered
it
as
a
signal
that
valancourt
was
about
to
leave
the
prison
soon
after
she
heard
steps
in
the
corridorâ€”they
were
the
light
quick
steps
of
hope
she
could
scarcely
support
herself
as
they
approached
but
opening
the
door
of
the
apartment
she
advanced
to
meet
valancourt
and
in
the
next
moment
sunk
in
the
arms
of
a
stranger
his
voiceâ€”his
countenance
instantly
convinced
her
and
she
fainted
away
on
reviving
she
found
herself
supported
by
the
stranger
who
was
watching
over
her
recovery
with
a
countenance
of
ineffable
tenderness
and
anxiety
she
had
no
spirits
for
reply
or
enquiry
she
asked
no
questions
but
burst
into
tears
and
disengaged
herself
from
his
arms
when
the
expression
of
his
countenance
changed
to
surprise
and
disappointment
and
he
turned
to
ludovico
for
an
explanation
annette
soon
gave
the
information
which
ludovico
could
not
â€œo
sirâ€
said
she
in
a
voice
interrupted
with
sobs
â€œo
sir
you
are
not
the
other
chevalier
we
expected
monsieur
valancourt
but
you
are
not
he
o
ludovico
how
could
you
deceive
us
so
my
poor
lady
will
never
recover
itâ€”neverâ€
the
stranger
who
now
appeared
much
agitated
attempted
to
speak
but
his
words
faltered
and
then
striking
his
hand
against
his
forehead
as
if
in
sudden
despair
he
walked
abruptly
to
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
suddenly
annette
dried
her
tears
and
spoke
to
ludovico
â€œbut
perhapsâ€
said
she
â€œafter
all
the
other
chevalier
is
not
this
perhaps
the
chevalier
valancourt
is
still
belowâ€
emily
raised
her
head
â€œnoâ€
replied
ludovico
â€œmonsieur
valancourt
never
was
below
if
this
gentleman
is
not
heâ€
â€œif
you
sirâ€
said
ludovico
addressing
the
stranger
â€œwould
but
have
had
the
goodness
to
trust
me
with
your
name
this
mistake
had
been
avoidedâ€
â€œmost
trueâ€
replied
the
stranger
speaking
in
broken
italian
â€œbut
it
was
of
the
utmost
consequence
to
me
that
my
name
should
be
concealed
from
montoni
madamâ€
added
he
then
addressing
emily
in
french
â€œwill
you
permit
me
to
apologise
for
the
pain
i
have
occasioned
you
and
to
explain
to
you
alone
my
name
and
the
circumstance
which
has
led
me
into
this
error
i
am
of
franceâ€”i
am
your
countrymanâ€”we
are
met
in
a
foreign
landâ€
emily
tried
to
compose
her
spirits
yet
she
hesitated
to
grant
his
request
at
length
desiring
that
ludovico
would
wait
on
the
staircase
and
detaining
annette
she
told
the
stranger
that
her
woman
understood
very
little
italian
and
begged
he
would
communicate
what
he
wished
to
say
in
that
languageâ€”having
withdrawn
to
a
distant
part
of
the
corridor
he
said
with
a
long-drawn
sigh
â€œyou
madam
are
no
stranger
to
me
though
i
am
so
unhappy
as
to
be
unknown
to
youâ€”my
name
is
du
pont
i
am
of
france
of
gascony
your
native
province
and
have
long
admiredâ€”and
why
should
i
affect
to
disguise
itâ€”have
long
loved
youâ€
he
paused
but
in
the
next
moment
proceeded
â€œmy
family
madam
is
probably
not
unknown
to
you
for
we
lived
within
a
few
miles
of
la
vallã©e
and
i
have
sometimes
had
the
happiness
of
meeting
you
on
visits
in
the
neighbourhood
i
will
not
offend
you
by
repeating
how
much
you
interested
me
how
much
i
loved
to
wander
in
the
scenes
you
frequented
how
often
i
visited
your
favourite
fishing-house
and
lamented
the
circumstance
which
at
that
time
forbade
me
to
reveal
my
passion
i
will
not
explain
how
i
surrendered
to
temptation
and
became
possessed
of
a
treasure
which
was
to
me
inestimable
a
treasure
which
i
committed
to
your
messenger
a
few
days
ago
with
expectations
very
different
from
my
present
ones
i
will
say
nothing
of
these
circumstances
for
i
know
they
will
avail
me
little
let
me
only
supplicate
from
you
forgiveness
and
the
picture
which
i
so
unwarily
returned
your
generosity
will
pardon
the
theft
and
restore
the
prize
my
crime
has
been
my
punishment
for
the
portrait
i
stole
has
contributed
to
nourish
a
passion
which
must
still
be
my
tormentâ€
emily
now
interrupted
him
â€œi
think
sir
i
may
leave
it
to
your
integrity
to
determine
whether
after
what
has
just
appeared
concerning
mons
valancourt
i
ought
to
return
the
picture
i
think
you
will
acknowledge
that
this
would
not
be
generosity
and
you
will
allow
me
to
add
that
it
would
be
doing
myself
an
injustice
i
must
consider
myself
honoured
by
your
good
opinion
butâ€â€”and
she
hesitatedâ€”â€œthe
mistake
of
this
evening
makes
it
unnecessary
for
me
to
say
moreâ€
â€œit
does
madamâ€”alas
it
doesâ€
said
the
stranger
who
after
a
long
pause
proceededâ€”â€œbut
you
will
allow
me
to
show
my
disinterestedness
though
not
my
love
and
will
accept
the
services
i
offer
yet
alas
what
services
can
i
offer
i
am
myself
a
prisoner
a
sufferer
like
you
but
dear
as
liberty
is
to
me
i
would
not
seek
it
through
half
the
hazards
i
would
encounter
to
deliver
you
from
this
recess
of
vice
accept
the
offered
services
of
a
friend
do
not
refuse
me
the
reward
of
having
at
least
attempted
to
deserve
your
thanksâ€
â€œyou
deserve
them
already
sirâ€
said
emily
â€œthe
wish
deserves
my
warmest
thanks
but
you
will
excuse
me
for
reminding
you
of
the
danger
you
incur
by
prolonging
this
interview
it
will
be
a
great
consolation
to
me
to
remember
whether
your
friendly
attempts
to
release
me
succeed
or
not
that
i
have
a
countryman
who
would
so
generously
protect
meâ€â€”monsieur
du
pont
took
her
hand
which
she
but
feebly
attempted
to
withdraw
and
pressed
it
respectfully
to
his
lips
â€œallow
me
to
breathe
another
fervent
sigh
for
your
happinessâ€
said
he
â€œand
to
applaud
myself
for
an
affection
which
i
cannot
conquerâ€
as
he
said
this
emily
heard
a
noise
from
her
apartment
and
turning
round
saw
the
door
from
the
staircase
open
and
a
man
rush
into
her
chamber
â€œi
will
teach
you
to
conquer
itâ€
cried
he
as
he
advanced
into
the
corridor
and
drew
a
stiletto
which
he
aimed
at
du
pont
who
was
unarmed
but
who
stepping
back
avoided
the
blow
and
then
sprung
upon
verezzi
from
whom
he
wrenched
the
stiletto
while
they
struggled
in
each
otherâ€™s
grasp
emily
followed
by
annette
ran
further
into
the
corridor
calling
on
ludovico
who
was
however
gone
from
the
staircase
and
as
she
advanced
terrified
and
uncertain
what
to
do
a
distant
noise
that
seemed
to
arise
from
the
hall
reminded
her
of
the
danger
she
was
incurring
and
sending
annette
forward
in
search
of
ludovico
she
returned
to
the
spot
where
du
pont
and
verezzi
were
still
struggling
for
victory
it
was
her
own
cause
which
was
to
be
decided
with
that
of
the
former
whose
conduct
independently
of
this
circumstance
would
however
have
interested
her
in
his
success
even
had
she
not
disliked
and
dreaded
verezzi
she
threw
herself
in
a
chair
and
supplicated
them
to
desist
from
further
violence
till
at
length
du
pont
forced
verezzi
to
the
floor
where
he
lay
stunned
by
the
violence
of
his
fall
and
she
then
entreated
du
pont
to
escape
from
the
room
before
montoni
or
his
party
should
appear
but
he
still
refused
to
leave
her
unprotected
and
while
emily
now
more
terrified
for
him
than
for
herself
enforced
the
entreaty
they
heard
steps
ascending
the
private
staircase
â€œo
you
are
lostâ€
cried
she
â€œthese
are
montoniâ€™s
peopleâ€
du
pont
made
no
reply
but
supported
emily
while
with
a
steady
though
eager
countenance
he
awaited
their
appearance
and
in
the
next
moment
ludovico
alone
mounted
the
landing-place
throwing
a
hasty
glance
round
the
chamber
â€œfollow
meâ€
said
he
â€œas
you
value
your
lives
we
have
not
an
instant
to
loseâ€
emily
enquired
what
had
occurred
and
whither
they
were
to
go
â€œi
cannot
stay
to
tell
you
now
signoraâ€
replied
ludovico
â€œfly
flyâ€
she
immediately
followed
him
accompanied
by
mons
du
pont
down
the
staircase
and
along
a
vaulted
passage
when
suddenly
she
recollected
annette
and
enquired
for
her
â€œshe
awaits
us
further
on
signoraâ€
said
ludovico
almost
breathless
with
haste
â€œthe
gates
were
open
a
moment
since
to
a
party
just
come
in
from
the
mountains
they
will
be
shut
i
fear
before
we
can
reach
them
through
this
door
signoraâ€
added
ludovico
holding
down
the
lamp
â€œtake
care
here
are
two
stepsâ€
emily
followed
trembling
still
more
than
before
she
had
understood
that
her
escape
from
the
castle
depended
upon
the
present
moment
while
du
pont
supported
her
and
endeavoured
as
they
passed
along
to
cheer
her
spirits
â€œspeak
low
signorâ€
said
ludovico
â€œthese
passages
send
echoes
all
round
the
castleâ€
â€œtake
care
of
the
lightâ€
cried
emily
â€œyou
go
so
fast
that
the
air
will
extinguish
itâ€
ludovico
now
opened
another
door
where
they
found
annette
and
the
party
then
descended
a
short
flight
of
steps
into
a
passage
which
ludovico
said
led
round
the
inner
court
of
the
castle
and
opened
into
the
outer
one
as
they
advanced
confused
and
tumultuous
sounds
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
inner
court
alarmed
emily
â€œnay
signoraâ€
said
ludovico
â€œour
only
hope
is
in
that
tumult
while
the
signorâ€™s
people
are
busied
about
the
men
who
are
just
arrived
we
may
perhaps
pass
unnoticed
through
the
gates
but
hushâ€
he
added
as
they
approached
the
small
door
that
opened
into
the
outer
court
â€œif
you
will
remain
here
a
moment
i
will
go
to
see
whether
the
gates
are
open
and
anybody
is
in
the
way
pray
extinguish
the
light
signor
if
you
hear
me
talkingâ€
continued
ludovico
delivering
the
lamp
to
du
pont
â€œand
remain
quite
stillâ€
saying
this
he
stepped
out
upon
the
court
and
they
closed
the
door
listening
anxiously
to
his
departing
steps
no
voice
however
was
heard
in
the
court
which
he
was
crossing
though
a
confusion
of
many
voices
yet
issued
from
the
inner
one
â€œwe
shall
soon
be
beyond
the
wallsâ€
said
du
pont
softly
to
emily
â€œsupport
yourself
a
little
longer
madam
and
all
will
be
wellâ€
but
soon
they
heard
ludovico
speaking
loud
and
the
voice
also
of
some
other
person
and
du
pont
immediately
extinguished
the
lamp
â€œah
it
is
too
lateâ€
exclaimed
emily
â€œwhat
is
to
become
of
usâ€
they
listened
again
and
then
perceived
that
ludovico
was
talking
with
a
sentinel
whose
voices
were
heard
also
by
emilyâ€™s
favourite
dog
that
had
followed
her
from
the
chamber
and
now
barked
loudly
â€œthis
dog
will
betray
usâ€
said
du
pont
â€œi
will
hold
himâ€
â€œi
fear
he
has
already
betrayed
usâ€
replied
emily
du
pont
however
caught
him
up
and
again
listening
to
what
was
going
on
without
they
heard
ludovico
say
â€œiâ€™ll
watch
the
gates
the
whileâ€
â€œstay
a
minuteâ€
replied
the
sentinel
â€œand
you
need
not
have
the
trouble
for
the
horses
will
be
sent
round
to
the
outer
stables
then
the
gates
will
be
shut
and
i
can
leave
my
postâ€
â€œi
donâ€™t
mind
the
trouble
comradeâ€
said
ludovico
â€œyou
will
do
such
another
good
turn
for
me
some
time
goâ€”go
and
fetch
the
wine
the
rogues
that
are
just
come
in
will
drink
it
all
elseâ€
the
soldier
hesitated
and
then
called
aloud
to
the
people
in
the
second
court
to
know
why
they
did
not
send
out
the
horses
that
the
gates
might
be
shut
but
they
were
too
much
engaged
to
attend
to
him
even
if
they
had
heard
his
voice
â€œayeâ€”ayeâ€
said
ludovico
â€œthey
know
better
than
that
they
are
sharing
it
all
among
them
if
you
wait
till
the
horses
come
out
you
must
wait
till
the
wine
is
drunk
i
have
had
my
share
already
but
since
you
do
not
care
about
yours
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
not
have
that
tooâ€
â€œhold
hold
not
so
fastâ€
cried
the
sentinel
â€œdo
watch
then
for
a
moment
iâ€™ll
be
with
you
presentlyâ€
â€œdonâ€™t
hurry
yourselfâ€
said
ludovico
coolly
â€œi
have
kept
guard
before
now
but
you
may
leave
me
your
trombone
that
if
the
castle
should
be
attacked
you
know
i
may
be
able
to
defend
the
pass
like
a
heroâ€
note
a
kind
of
blunderbuss
a
r
â€œthere
my
good
fellowâ€
returned
the
soldier
â€œthere
take
itâ€”it
has
seen
service
though
it
could
do
little
in
defending
the
castle
iâ€™ll
tell
you
a
good
story
though
about
this
same
tromboneâ€
â€œyouâ€™ll
tell
it
better
when
you
have
had
the
wineâ€
said
ludovico
â€œthere
they
are
coming
out
from
the
court
alreadyâ€
â€œiâ€™ll
have
the
wine
thoughâ€
said
the
sentinel
running
off
â€œi
wonâ€™t
keep
you
a
minuteâ€
â€œtake
your
time
i
am
in
no
hasteâ€
replied
ludovico
who
was
already
hurrying
across
the
court
when
the
soldier
came
back
â€œwhither
so
fast
friendâ€”whither
so
fastâ€
said
the
latter
â€œwhat
is
this
the
way
you
keep
watch
i
must
stand
to
my
post
myself
i
seeâ€
â€œaye
wellâ€
replied
ludovico
â€œyou
have
saved
me
the
trouble
of
following
you
further
for
i
wanted
to
tell
you
if
you
have
a
mind
to
drink
the
tuscany
wine
you
must
go
to
sebastian
he
is
dealing
it
out
the
other
that
federico
has
is
not
worth
having
but
you
are
not
likely
to
have
any
i
see
for
they
are
all
coming
outâ€
â€œby
st
peter
so
they
areâ€
said
the
soldier
and
again
ran
off
while
ludovico
once
more
at
liberty
hastened
to
the
door
of
the
passage
where
emily
was
sinking
under
the
anxiety
this
long
discourse
had
occasioned
but
on
his
telling
them
the
court
was
clear
they
followed
him
to
the
gates
without
waiting
another
instant
yet
not
before
he
had
seized
two
horses
that
had
strayed
from
the
second
court
and
were
picking
a
scanty
meal
among
the
grass
which
grew
between
the
pavement
of
the
first
they
passed
without
interruption
the
dreadful
gates
and
took
the
road
that
led
down
among
the
woods
emily
monsieur
du
pont
and
annette
on
foot
and
ludovico
who
was
mounted
on
one
horse
leading
the
other
having
reached
them
they
stopped
while
emily
and
annette
were
placed
on
horseback
with
their
two
protectors
when
ludovico
leading
the
way
they
set
off
as
fast
as
the
broken
road
and
the
feeble
light
which
a
rising
moon
threw
among
the
foliage
would
permit
emily
was
so
much
astonished
by
this
sudden
departure
that
she
scarcely
dared
to
believe
herself
awake
and
she
yet
much
doubted
whether
this
adventure
would
terminate
in
escapeâ€”a
doubt
which
had
too
much
probability
to
justify
it
for
before
they
quitted
the
woods
they
heard
shouts
in
the
wind
and
on
emerging
from
them
saw
lights
moving
quickly
near
the
castle
above
du
pont
whipped
his
horse
and
with
some
difficulty
compelled
him
to
go
faster
â€œah
poor
beastâ€
said
ludovico
â€œhe
is
weary
enoughâ€”he
has
been
out
all
day
but
signor
we
must
fly
for
it
now
for
yonder
are
lights
coming
this
wayâ€
having
given
his
own
horse
a
lash
they
now
both
set
off
on
a
full
gallop
and
when
they
again
looked
back
the
lights
were
so
distant
as
scarcely
to
be
discerned
and
the
voices
were
sunk
into
silence
the
travellers
then
abated
their
pace
and
consulting
whither
they
should
direct
their
course
it
was
determined
they
should
descend
into
tuscany
and
endeavour
to
reach
the
mediterranean
where
they
could
readily
embark
for
france
thither
du
pont
meant
to
attend
emily
if
he
should
learn
that
the
regiment
he
had
accompanied
into
italy
was
returned
to
his
native
country
they
were
now
in
the
road
which
emily
had
travelled
with
ugo
and
bertrand
but
ludovico
who
was
the
only
one
of
the
party
acquainted
with
the
passes
of
these
mountains
said
that
a
little
further
on
a
by-road
branching
from
this
would
lead
them
down
into
tuscany
with
very
little
difficulty
and
that
at
a
few
leagues
distance
was
a
small
town
where
necessaries
could
be
procured
for
their
journey
â€œbut
i
hopeâ€
added
he
â€œwe
shall
meet
with
no
straggling
parties
of
banditti
some
of
them
are
abroad
i
know
however
i
have
got
a
good
trombone
which
will
be
of
some
service
if
we
should
encounter
any
of

brave
spirits
you
have
no

signorâ€
â€œyesâ€
replied
du
pont
â€œi
have
the
villainâ€™s
stilletto
who
would
have
stabbed
meâ€”but
let
us
rejoice
in
our
escape
from
udolpho
nor
torment
ourselves
with
looking
out
for
dangers
that
may
never
arriveâ€
the
moon
was
now
risen
high
over
the
woods
that
hung
upon
the
sides
of
the
narrow
glen
through
which
they
wandered
and
afforded
them
light
sufficient
to
distinguish
their
way
and
to
avoid
the
loose
and
broken
stones
that
frequently
crossed
it
they
now
travelled
leisurely
and
in
profound
silence
for
they
had
scarcely
yet
recovered
from
the
astonishment
into
which
this
sudden
escape
had
thrown
themâ€”emilyâ€™s
mind
especially
was
sunk
after
the
various
emotions
it
had
suffered
into
a
kind
of
musing
stillness
which
the
reposing
beauty
of
the
surrounding
scene
and
the
creeping
murmur
of
the
night-breeze
among
the
foliage
above
contributed
to
prolong
she
thought
of
valancourt
and
of
france
with
hope
and
she
would
have
thought
of
them
with
joy
had
not
the
first
events
of
this
evening
harassed
her
spirits
too
much
to
permit
her
now
to
feel
so
lively
a
sensation
meanwhile
emily
was
alone
the
object
of
du
pontâ€™s
melancholy
consideration
yet
with
the
despondency
he
suffered
as
he
mused
on
his
recent
disappointment
was
mingled
a
sweet
pleasure
occasioned
by
her
presence
though
they
did
not
now
exchange
a
single
word
annette
thought
of
this
wonderful
escape
of
the
bustle
in
which
montoni
and
his
people
must
be
now
that
their
flight
was
discovered
of
her
native
country
whither
she
hoped
she
was
returning
and
of
her
marriage
with
ludovico
to
which
there
no
longer
appeared
any
impediment
for
poverty
she
did
not
consider
such
ludovico
on
his
part
congratulated
himself
on
having
rescued
his
annette
and
signora
emily
from
the
danger
that
had
surrounded
them
on
his
own
liberation
from
people
whose
manners
he
had
long
detested
on
the
freedom
he
had
given
to
monsieur
du
pont
on
his
prospect
of
happiness
with
the
object
of
his
affections
and
not
a
little
on
the
address
with
which
he
had
deceived
the
sentinel
and
conducted
the
whole
of
this
affair
thus
variously
engaged
in
thought
the
travellers
passed
on
silently
for
above
an
hour
a
question
only
being
now
and
then
asked
by
du
pont
concerning
the
road
or
a
remark
uttered
by
annette
respecting
objects
seen
imperfectly
in
the
twilight
at
length
lights
were
perceived
twinkling
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
and
ludovico
had
no
doubt
that
they
proceeded
from
the
town
he
had
mentioned
while
his
companions
satisfied
by
this
assurance
sunk
again
into
silence
annette
was
the
first
who
interrupted
this
â€œholy
peterâ€
said
she
â€œwhat
shall
we
do
for
money
on
our
journey
for
i
know
neither
i
nor
my
lady
have
a
single
sequin
the
signor
took
care
of
thatâ€
this
remark
produced
a
serious
enquiry
which
ended
in
as
serious
an
embarrassment
for
du
pont
had
been
rifled
of
nearly
all
his
money
when
he
was
taken
prisoner
the
remainder
he
had
given
to
the
sentinel
who
had
enabled
him
occasionally
to
leave
his
prison-chamber
and
ludovico
who
had
for
some
time
found
a
difficulty
in
procuring
any
part
of
the
wages
due
to
him
had
now
scarcely
cash
sufficient
to
procure
necessary
refreshment
at
the
first
town
in
which
they
should
arrive
their
poverty
was
the
more
distressing
since
it
would
detain
them
among
the
mountains
where
even
in
a
town
they
could
scarcely
consider
themselves
safe
from
montoni
the
travellers
however
had
only
to
proceed
and
dare
the
future
and
they
continued
their
way
through
lonely
wilds
and
dusky
valleys
where
the
overhanging
foliage
now
admitted
and
then
excluded
the
moonlight
wilds
so
desolate
that
they
appeared
on
the
first
glance
as
if
no
human
being
had
ever
trod
them
before
even
the
road
in
which
the
party
were
did
but
slightly
contradict
this
error
for
the
high
grass
and
other
luxuriant
vegetation
with
which
it
was
overgrown
told
how
very
seldom
the
foot
of
a
traveller
had
passed
it
at
length
from
a
distance
was
heard
the
faint
tinkling
of
a
sheep-bell
and
soon
after
the
bleat
of
flocks
and
the
party
then
knew
that
they
were
near
some
human
habitation
for
the
light
which
ludovico
had
fancied
to
proceed
from
a
town
had
long
been
concealed
by
intervening
mountains
cheered
by
this
hope
they
quickened
their
pace
along
the
narrow
pass
they
were
winding
and
it
opened
upon
one
of
those
pastoral
valleys
of
the
apennines
which
might
be
painted
for
a
scene
of
arcadia
and
whose
beauty
and
simplicity
are
finely
contrasted
by
the
grandeur
of
the
snowtopped
mountains
above
the
morning
light
now
glimmering
in
the
horizon
showed
faintly
at
a
little
distance
upon
the
brow
of
a
hill
which
seemed
to
peep
from
â€œunder
the
opening
eye-lids
of
the
mornâ€
the
town
they
were
in
search
of
and
which
they
soon
after
reached
it
was
not
without
some
difficulty
that
they
there
found
a
house
which
could
afford
shelter
for
themselves
and
their
horses
and
emily
desired
they
might
not
rest
longer
than
was
necessary
for
refreshment
her
appearance
excited
some
surprise
for
she
was
without
a
hat
having
had
time
only
to
throw
on
her
veil
before
she
left
the
castle
a
circumstance
that
compelled
her
to
regret
again
the
want
of
money
without
which
it
was
impossible
to
procure
this
necessary
article
of
dress
ludovico
on
examining
his
purse
found
it
even
insufficient
to
supply
present
refreshment
and
du
pont
at
length
ventured
to
inform
the
landlord
whose
countenance
was
simple
and
honest
of
their
exact
situation
and
requested
that
he
would
assist
them
to
pursue
their
journey
a
purpose
which
he
promised
to
comply
with
as
far
as
he
was
able
when
he
learned
that
they
were
prisoners
escaping
from
montoni
whom
he
had
too
much
reason
to
hate
but
though
he
consented
to
lend
them
fresh
horses
to
carry
them
to
the
next
town
he
was
too
poor
himself
to
trust
them
with
money
and
they
were
again
lamenting
their
poverty
when
ludovico
who
had
been
with
his
tired
horses
to
the
hovel
which
served
for
a
stable
entered
the
room
half
frantic
with
joy
in
which
his
auditors
soon
participated
on
removing
the
saddle
from
one
of
the
horses
he
had
found
beneath
it
a
small
bag
containing
no
doubt
the
booty
of
one
of
the
condottieri
who
had
returned
from
a
plundering
excursion
just
before
ludovico
left
the
castle
and
whose
horse
having
strayed
from
the
inner
court
while
his
master
was
engaged
in
drinking
had
brought
away
the
treasure
which
the
ruffian
had
considered
the
reward
of
his
exploit
on
counting
over
this
du
pont
found
that
it
would
be
more
than
sufficient
to
carry
them
all
to
france
where
he
now
determined
to
accompany
emily
whether
he
should
obtain
intelligence
of
his
regiment
or
not
for
though
he
had
as
much
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
ludovico
as
his
small
knowledge
of
him
allowed
he
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
committing
her
to
his
care
for
the
voyage
nor
perhaps
had
he
resolution
enough
to
deny
himself
the
dangerous
pleasure
which
he
might
derive
from
her
presence
he
now
consulted
them
concerning
the
sea-port
to
which
they
should
direct
their
way
and
ludovico
better
informed
of
the
geography
of
the
country
said
that
leghorn
was
the
nearest
port
of
consequence
which
du
pont
knew
also
to
be
the
most
likely
of
any
in
italy
to
assist
their
plan
since
from
thence
vessels
of
all
nations
were
continually
departing
thither
therefore
it
was
determined
that
they
should
proceed
emily
having
purchased
a
little
straw
hat
such
as
was
worn
by
the
peasant
girls
of
tuscany
and
some
other
little
necessary
equipments
for
the
journey
and
the
travellers
having
exchanged
their
tired
horses
for
others
better
able
to
carry
them
recommenced
their
joyous
way
as
the
sun
was
rising
over
the
mountains
and
after
travelling
through
this
romantic
country
for
several
hours
began
to
descend
into
the
vale
of
arno
and
here
emily
beheld
all
the
charms
of
sylvan
and
pastoral
landscape
united
adorned
with
the
elegant
villas
of
the
florentine
nobles
and
diversified
with
the
various
riches
of
cultivation
how
vivid
the
shrubs
that
embowered
the
slopes
with
the
woods
that
stretched
amphitheatrically
along
the
mountains
and
above
all
how
elegant
the
outline
of
these
waving
apennines
now
softening
from
the
wildness
which
their
interior
regions
exhibited
at
a
distance
in
the
east
emily
discovered
florence
with
its
towers
rising
on
the
brilliant
horizon
and
its
luxuriant
plain
spreading
to
the
feet
of
the
apennines
speckled
with
gardens
and
magnificent
villas
or
coloured
with
groves
of
orange
and
lemon
with
vines
corn
and
plantations
of
olives
and
mulberry
while
to
the
west
the
vale
opened
to
the
waters
of
the
mediterranean
so
distant
that
they
were
known
only
by
a
bluish
line
that
appeared
upon
the
horizon
and
by
the
light
marine
vapour
which
just
stained
the
ã¦ther
above
with
a
full
heart
emily
hailed
the
waves
that
were
to
bear
her
back
to
her
native
country
the
remembrance
of
which
however
brought
with
it
a
pang
for
she
had
there
no
home
to
receive
no
parents
to
welcome
her
but
was
going
like
a
forlorn
pilgrim
to
weep
over
the
sad
spot
where
he
who
was
her
father
lay
interred
nor
were
her
spirits
cheered
when
she
considered
how
long
it
would
probably
be
before
she
should
see
valancourt
who
might
be
stationed
with
his
regiment
in
a
distant
part
of
france
and
that
when
they
did
meet
it
would
be
only
to
lament
the
successful
villany
of
montoni
yet
still
she
would
have
felt
inexpressible
delight
at
the
thought
of
being
once
more
in
the
same
country
with
valancourt
had
it
even
been
certain
that
she
could
not
see
him
the
intense
heat
for
it
was
now
noon
obliged
the
travellers
to
look
out
for
a
shady
recess
where
they
might
rest
for
a
few
hours
and
the
neighbouring
thickets
abounding
with
wild
grapes
raspberries
and
figs
promised
them
grateful
refreshment
soon
after
they
turned
from
the
road
into
a
grove
whose
thick
foliage
entirely
excluded
the
sunbeams
and
where
a
spring
gushing
from
the
rock
gave
coolness
to
the
air
and
having
alighted
and
turned
the
horses
to
graze
annette
and
ludovico
ran
to
gather
fruit
from
the
surrounding
thickets
of
which
they
soon
returned
with
an
abundance
the
travellers
seated
under
the
shade
of
a
pine
and
cypress
grove
and
on
turf
enriched
with
such
a
profusion
of
fragrant
flowers
as
emily
had
scarcely
ever
seen
even
among
the
pyrenees
took
their
simple
repast
and
viewed
with
new
delight
beneath
the
dark
umbrage
of
gigantic
pines
the
glowing
landscape
stretching
to
the
sea
emily
and
du
pont
gradually
became
thoughtful
and
silent
but
annette
was
all
joy
and
loquacity
and
ludovico
was
gay
without
forgetting
the
respectful
distance
which
was
due
to
his
companions
the
repast
being
over
du
pont
recommended
emily
to
endeavour
to
sleep
during
these
sultry
hours
and
desiring
the
servants
would
do
the
same
said
he
would
watch
the
while
but
ludovico
wished
to
spare
him
this
trouble
and
emily
and
annette
wearied
with
travelling
tried
to
repose
while
he
stood
guard
with
his
trombone
when
emily
refreshed
by
slumber
awoke
she
found
the
sentinel
asleep
on
his
post
and
du
pont
awake
but
lost
in
melancholy
thought
as
the
sun
was
yet
too
high
to
allow
them
to
continue
their
journey
and
as
it
was
necessary
that
ludovico
after
the
toils
and
trouble
he
had
suffered
should
finish
his
sleep
emily
took
this
opportunity
of
enquiring
by
what
accident
du
pont
became
montoniâ€™s
prisoner
and
he
pleased
with
the
interest
this
enquiry
expressed
and
with
the
excuse
it
gave
him
for
talking
to
her
of
himself
immediately
answered
her
curiosity
â€œi
came
into
italy
madamâ€
said
du
pont
â€œin
the
service
of
my
country
in
an
adventure
among
the
mountains
our
party
engaging
with
the
bands
of
montoni
was
routed
and
i
with
a
few
of
my
comrades
was
taken
prisoner
when
they
told
me
whose
captive
i
was
the
name
of
montoni
struck
me
for
i
remembered
that
madame
cheron
your
aunt
had
married
an
italian
of
that
name
and
that
you
had
accompanied
them
into
italy
it
was
not
however
till
some
time
after
that
i
became
convinced
this
was
the

montoni

learned
that
you
madam
was
under
the
same
roof
with
myself
i
will
not
pain
you
by
describing
what
were
my
emotions
upon
this
discovery
which
i
owed
to
a
sentinel
whom
i
had
so
far
won
to
my
interest
that
he
granted
me
many
indulgences
one
of
which
was
very
important
to
me
and
somewhat
dangerous
to
himself
but
he
persisted
in
refusing
to
convey
any
letter
or
notice
of
my
situation
to
you
for
he
justly
dreaded
a
discovery
and
the
consequent
vengeance
of
montoni
he
however
enabled
me
to
see
you
more
than
once
you
are
surprised
madam
and
i
will
explain
myself
my
health
and
spirits
suffered
extremely
from
want
of
air
and
exercise
and
at
length
i
gained
so
far
upon
the
pity
or
the
avarice
of
the
man
that
he
gave
me
the
means
of
walking
on
the
terraceâ€
emily
now
listened
with
very
anxious
attention
to
the
narrative
of
du
pont
who
proceeded
â€œin
granting
this
indulgence
he
knew
that
he
had
nothing
to
apprehend
from
a
chance
of
my
escaping
from
a
castle

was
vigilantly
guarded

the
nearest

kind

prodigious
walls
of

which
were
undoubtedly
contrived
for
the
purpose

facilitating
escapes

of

soldiers
in
one
of
these
midnight
wanderings
i
saw
light
in
a
casement
that
overlooked
the
rampart
and
which
i
observed
was
immediately
over
my
prison-chamber
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
be
in
that
apartment
and
with
the
hope
of
seeing
you
i
placed
myself
opposite
to
the
windowâ€
emily
remembering
the
figure
that
had
formerly
appeared
on
the
terrace
and
which
had
occasioned
her
so
much
anxiety
exclaimed
â€œit
was
you
then
monsieur
du
pont
who
occasioned
me
much
foolish
terror
my
spirits
were
at
that
time
so
much
weakened
by
long
suffering
that
they
took
alarm
at
every
hintâ€
du
pont
after
lamenting
that
he
had
occasioned
her
any
apprehension
added
â€œas
i
rested
on
the
wall
opposite
to
your
casement
the
consideration
of
your
melancholy
situation
and
of
my
own
called
from
me
involuntary
sounds
of
lamentation
which
drew
you
i
fancy
to
the
casement
i
saw
there
a
person
whom
i
believed
to
be
you
o
i
will
say
nothing
of
my
emotion
at
that
moment
i
wished
to
speak
but
prudence
restrained
me
till
the
distant
foot-step
of
a
sentinel
compelled
me
suddenly
to
quit
my
station
â€œit
was
some
time
before
i
had
another
opportunity
of
walking
for
i
could
only
leave
my
prison
when
it
happened
to
be
the
turn
of
one
man
to
guard
me
meanwhile
i
became
convinced
from
some
circumstances
related
by
him
that
your
apartment
was
over
mine
and
when
again
i
ventured
forth
i
returned
to
your
casement
where
again
i
saw
you
but
without
daring
to
speak
i
waved
my
hand
and
you
suddenly
disappeared
then
it
was
that
i
forgot
my
prudence
and
yielded
to
lamentation
again
you
appearedâ€”you
spokeâ€”i
heard
the
well-known
accent
of
your
voice
and
at
that
moment
my
discretion
would
have
forsaken
me
again
had
i
not
heard
also
the
approaching
steps
of
a
soldier
when
i
instantly
quitted
the
place
though
not
before
the
man
had
seen
me
he
followed
down
the
terrace
and
gained
so
fast
upon
me
that
i
was
compelled
to
make
use
of
a
stratagem
ridiculous
enough
to
save
myself
i
had
heard
of
the
superstition
of
many
of
these
men
and
i
uttered
a
strange
noise
with
a
hope
that
my
pursuer
would
mistake
it
for
something
supernatural
and
desist
from
pursuit
luckily
for
myself
i
succeeded
the
man
it
seems
was
subject
to
fits
and
the
terror
he
suffered
threw
him
into
one
by
which
accident
i
secured
my
retreat
a
sense
of
the
danger
i
had
escaped
and
the
increased
watchfulness
which
my
appearance
had
occasioned
among
the
sentinels
deterred
me
ever
after
from
walking
on
the
terrace
but
in
the
stillness
of
night
i
frequently
beguiled
myself
with
an
old
lute
procured
for
me
by
a
soldier
which
i
sometimes
accompanied
with
my
voice
and
sometimes
i
will
acknowledge
with
a
hope
of
making
myself
heard
by
you
but
it
was
only
a
few
evenings
ago
that
this
hope
was
answered
i
then
thought
i
heard
a
voice
in
the
wind
calling
me
yet
even
then
i
feared
to
reply
lest
the
sentinel
at
the
prison
door
should
hear
me
was
i
right
madam
in
this
conjectureâ€”was
it
you
who
spokeâ€
â€œyesâ€
said
emily
with
an
involuntary
sigh
â€œyou
were
right
indeedâ€
du
pont
observing
the
painful
emotions
which
this
question
revived
now
changed
the
subject
â€œin
one
of
my
excursions
through
the
passage
which
i
have
mentioned
i
overheard
a
singular
conversationâ€
said
he
â€œin
the
passageâ€
said
emily
with
surprise
â€œi
heard
it
in
the
passageâ€
said
du
pont
â€œbut
it
proceeded
from
an
apartment
adjoining
the
wall
within
which
the
passage
wound
and
the
shell
of
the
wall
was
there
so
thin
and
was
also
somewhat
decayed
that
i
could
distinctly
hear
every
word
spoken
on
the
other
side
it
happened
that
montoni
and
his
companions
were
assembled
in
the
room
and
montoni
began
to
relate
the
extraordinary
history
of
the
lady
his
predecessor
in
the
castle
he
did
indeed
mention
some
very
surprising
circumstances
and
whether
they
were
strictly
true
his
conscience
must
decide
i
fear
it
will
determine
against
him
but
you
madam
have
doubtless
heard
the
report
which
he
designs
should
circulate
on
the
subject
of
that
ladyâ€™s
mysterious
fateâ€
â€œi
have
sirâ€
replied
emily
â€œand
i
perceive
that
you
doubt
itâ€
â€œi
doubted
it
before
the
period
i
am
speaking
ofâ€
rejoined
du
pontâ€”â€œbut
some
circumstances
mentioned
by
montoni
greatly
contributed
to
my
suspicions
the
account
i
then
heard
almost
convinced
me
that
he
was
a
murderer
i
trembled
for
youâ€”the
more
so
that
i
had
heard
the
guests
mention
your
name
in
a
manner
that
threatened
your
repose
and
knowing
that
the
most
impious
men
are
often
the
most
superstitious
i
determined
to
try
whether
i
could
not
awaken
their
consciences
and
awe
them
from
the
commission
of
the
crime
i
dreaded
i
listened
closely
to
montoni
and
in
the
most
striking
passages
of
his
story
i
joined
my
voice
and
repeated
his
last
words
in
a
disguised
and
hollow
toneâ€
â€œbut
were
you
not
afraid
of
being
discoveredâ€
said
emily
â€œi
was
notâ€
replied
du
pont
â€œfor
i
knew
that
if
montoni
had
been
acquainted
with
the
secret
of
this
passage
he
would
not
have
confined
me
in
the
apartment
to
which
it
led
i
knew
also
from
better
authority
that
he
was
ignorant
of
it
the
party
for
some
time
appeared
inattentive
to
my
voice
but
at
length
were
so
much
alarmed
that
they
quitted
the
apartment
and
having
heard
montoni
order
his
servants
to
search
it
i
returned
to
my
prison
which
was
very
distant
from
this
part
of
the
passageâ€
â€œi
remember
perfectly
to
have
heard
of
the
conversation
you
mentionâ€
said
emily
â€œit
spread
a
general
alarm
among
montoniâ€™s
people
and
i
will
own
i
was
weak
enough
to
partake
of
itâ€
monsieur
du
pont
and
emily
thus
continued
to
converse
of
montoni
and
then
of
france
and
of
the
plan
of
their
voyage
when
emily
told
him
that
it
was
her
intention
to
retire
to
a
convent
in
languedoc
where
she
had
been
formerly
treated
with
much
kindness
and
from
thence
to
write
to
her
relation
monsieur
quesnel
and
inform
him
of
her
conduct
there
she
designed
to
wait
till
la
vallã©e
should
again
be
her
own
whither
she
hoped
her
income
would
some
time
permit
her
to
return
for
du
pont
now
taught
her
to
expect
that
the
estate
of
which
montoni
had
attempted
to
defraud
her
was
not
irrecoverably
lost
and
he
again
congratulated
her
on
her
escape
from
montoni
who
he
had
not
a
doubt
meant
to
have
detained
her
for
life
the
possibility
of
recovering
her
auntâ€™s
estates
for
valancourt
and
herself
lighted
up
a
joy
in
emilyâ€™s
heart
such
as
she
had
not
known
for
many
months
but
she
endeavoured
to
conceal
this
from
monsieur
du
pont
lest
it
should
lead
him
to
a
painful
remembrance
of
his
rival
they
continued
to
converse
till
the
sun
was
declining
in
the
west
when
du
pont
awoke
ludovico
and
they
set
forward
on
their
journey
gradually
descending
the
lower
slopes
of
the
valley
they
reached
the
arno
and
wound
along
its
pastoral
margin
for
many
miles
delighted
with
the
scenery
around
them
and
with
the
remembrances
which
its
classic
waves
revived
at
a
distance
they
heard
the
gay
song
of
the
peasants
among
the
vineyards
and
observed
the
setting
sun
tint
the
waves
with
yellow
lustre
and
twilight
draw
a
dusky
purple
over
the
mountains
which
at
length
deepened
into
night
then
the
lucciola
the
fire-fly
of
tuscany
was
seen
to
flash
its
sudden
sparks
among
the
foliage
while
the
cicala
with
its
shrill
note
became
more
clamorous
than
even
during
the
noon-day
heat
loving
best
the
hour
when
the
english
beetle
with
less
offensive
sound
winds
his
small
but
sullen
horn
as
oft
he
rises
â€™midst
the
twilight
path
against
the
pilgrim
borne
in
heedless
hum
collins
the
travellers
crossed
the
arno
by
moonlight
at
a
ferry
and
learning
that
pisa
was
distant
only
a
few
miles
down
the
river
they
wished
to
have
proceeded
thither
in
a
boat
but
as
none
could
be
procured
they
set
out
on
their
wearied
horses
for
that
city
as
they
approached
it
the
vale
expanded
into
a
plain
variegated
with
vineyards
corn
olives
and
mulberry
groves
but
it
was
late
before
they
reached
its
gates
where
emily
was
surprised
to
hear
the
busy
sound
of
footsteps
and
the
tones
of
musical
instruments
as
well
as
to
see
the
lively
groups
that
filled
the
streets
and
she
almost
fancied
herself
again
at
venice
but
here
was
no
moonlight
seaâ€”no
gay
gondolas
dashing
the
wavesâ€”no
palladian
palaces
to
throw
enchantment
over
the
fancy
and
lead
it
into
the
wilds
of
fairy
story
the
arno
rolled
through
the
town
but
no
music
trembled
from
balconies
over
its
waters
it
gave
only
the
busy
voices
of
sailors
on
board
vessels
just
arrived
from
the
mediterranean
the
melancholy
heaving
of
the
anchor
and
the
shrill
boatswainâ€™s
whistleâ€”sounds
which
since
that
period
have
there
sunk
almost
into
silence
they
then
served
to
remind
du
pont
that
it
was
probable
he
might
hear
of
a
vessel
sailing
soon
to
france
from
this
port
and
thus
be
spared
the
trouble
of
going
to
leghorn
as
soon
as
emily
had
reached
the
inn
he
went
therefore
to
the
quay
to
make
his
enquiries
but
after
all
the
endeavours
of
himself
and
ludovico
they
could
hear
of
no
bark
destined
immediately
for
france
and
the
travellers
returned
to
their
resting-place
here
also
du
pont
endeavoured
to
learn
where
his
regiment
then
lay
but
could
acquire
no
information
concerning
it
the
travellers
retired
early
to
rest
after
the
fatigues
of
this
day
and
on
the
following
rose
early
and
without
pausing
to
view
the
celebrated
antiquities
of
the
place
or
the
wonders
of
its
hanging
tower
pursued
their
journey
in
the
cooler
hours
through
a
charming
country
rich
with
wine
and
corn
and
oil
the
apennines
no
longer
awful
or
even
grand
here
softened
into
the
beauty
of
sylvan
and
pastoral
landscape
and
emily
as
she
descended
them
looked
down
delighted
on
leghorn
and
its
spacious
bay
filled
with
vessels
and
crowned
with
these
beautiful
hills
she
was
no
less
surprised
and
amused
on
entering
this
town
to
find
it
crowded
with
persons
in
the
dresses
of
all
nations
a
scene
which
reminded
her
of
a
venetian
masquerade
such
as
she
had
witnessed
at
the
time
of
the
carnival
but
here
was
bustle
without
gaiety
and
noise
instead
of
music
while
elegance
was
to
be
looked
for
only
in
the
waving
outlines
of
the
surrounding
hills
monsieur
du
pont
immediately
on
their
arrival
went
down
to
the
quay
where
he
heard
of
several
french
vessels
and
of
one
that
was
to
sail
in
a
few
days
for
marseilles
from
whence
another
vessel
could
be
procured
without
difficulty
to
take
them
across
the
gulf
of
lyons
towards
narbonne
on
the
coast
not
many
leagues
from
which
city
he
understood
the
convent
was
seated
to
which
emily
wished
to
retire
he
therefore
immediately
engaged
with
the
captain
to
take
them
to
marseilles
and
emily
was
delighted
to
hear
that
her
passage
to
france
was
secured
her
mind
was
now
relieved
from
the
terror
of
pursuit
and
the
pleasing
hope
of
soon
seeing
her
native
countryâ€”that
country
which
held
valancourt
restored
to
her
spirits
a
degree
of
cheerfulness
such
as
she
had
scarcely
known
since
the
death
of
her
father
at
leghorn
also
du
pont
heard
of
his
regiment
and
that
it
had
embarked
for
france
a
circumstance
which
gave
him
great
satisfaction
for
he
could
now
accompany
emily
thither
without
reproach
to
his
conscience
or
apprehension
of
displeasure
from
his
commander
during
these
days
he
scrupulously
forbore
to
distress
her
by
a
mention
of
his
passion
and
she
was
compelled
to
esteem
and
pity
though
she
could
not
love
him
he
endeavoured
to
amuse
her
by
showing
the
environs
of
the
town
and
they
often
walked
together
on
the
sea-shore
and
on
the
busy
quays
where
emily
was
frequently
interested
by
the
arrival
and
departure
of
vessels
participating
in
the
joy
of
meeting
friends
and
sometimes
shedding
a
sympathetic
tear
to
the
sorrow
of
those
that
were
separating
it
was
after
having
witnessed
a
scene
of
the
latter
kind
that
she
arranged
the
following
stanzas
the
mariner

breath
of

busy

vessel
heaves
the
farewell

mute

each
tongue
and
eloquent

eye
the
last
dread

sailor
youth
hides
the
big
drop
then
smiles
amid
his
pain
sooths
his
sad
bride
and
vows
eternal
truth
â€œfarewell

meet
againâ€
long
on

stern

from

seek
once
more
the
far-seen
coast
where
all
his
wishes
rest
he
views
its
dark
line
on
the
distant
sky
and
fancy
leads
him
to
his
little
home
he
sees
his
weeping

sooths
her

we
now
return
to
languedoc
and
to
the
mention
of
count
de
villefort
the
nobleman
who
succeeded
to
an
estate
of
the
marquis
de
villeroi
situated
near
the
monastery
of
st
claire
it
may
be
recollected
that
this
chã¢teau
was
uninhabited
when
st
aubert
and
his
daughter
were
in
the
neighbourhood
and
that
the
former
was
much
affected
on
discovering
himself
to
be
so
near
chã¢teau-le-blanc
a
place
concerning
which
the
good
old
la
voisin
afterwards
dropped
some
hints
that
had
alarmed
emilyâ€™s
curiosity
it
was
in
the
year
1584
the
beginning
of
that
in
which
st
aubert
died
that
francis
beauveau
count
de
villefort
came
into
possession
of
the
mansion
and
extensive
domain
called
chã¢teau-le-blanc
situated
in
the
province
of
languedoc
on
the
shore
of
the
mediterranean
this
estate
which
during
some
centuries
had
belonged
to
his
family
now
descended
to
him
on
the
decease
of
his
relative
the
marquis
de
villeroi
who
had
been
latterly
a
man
of
reserved
manners
and
austere
character
circumstances
which
together
with
the
duties
of
his
profession
that
often
called
him
into
the
field
had
prevented
any
degree
of
intimacy
with
his
cousin
the
count
de
villefort
for
many
years
they
had
known
little
of
each
other
and
the
count
received
the
first
intelligence
of
his
death
which
happened
in
a
distant
part
of
france
together
with
the
instruments
that
gave
him
possession
of
the
domain
chã¢teau-le-blanc
but
it
was
not
till
the
following
year
that
he
determined
to
visit
that
estate
when
he
designed
to
pass
the
autumn
there
the
scenes
of
chã¢teau-le-blanc
often
came
to
his
remembrance
heightened
by
the
touches
which
a
warm
imagination
gives
to
the
recollection
of
early
pleasures
for
many
years
before
in
the
life-time
of
the
marchioness
and
at
that
age
when
the
mind
is
particularly
sensible
to
impressions
of
gaiety
and
delight
he
had
once
visited
this
spot
and
though
he
had
passed
a
long
intervening
period
amidst
the
vexations
and
tumults
of
public
affairs
which
too
frequently
corrode
the
heart
and
vitiate
the
taste
the
shades
of
languedoc
and
the
grandeur
of
its
distant
scenery
had
never
been
remembered
by
him
with
indifference
during
many
years
the
chã¢teau
had
been
abandoned
by
the
late
marquis
and
being
inhabited
only
by
an
old
steward
and
his
wife
had
been
suffered
to
fall
much
into
decay
to
superintend
the
repairs
that
would
be
requisite
to
make
it
a
comfortable
residence
had
been
a
principal
motive
with
the
count
for
passing
the
autumnal
months
in
languedoc
and
neither
the
remonstrances
nor
the
tears
of
the
countess
for
on
urgent
occasions
she
could
weep
were
powerful
enough
to
overcome
his
determination
she
prepared
therefore
to
obey
the
command
which
she
could
not
conquer
and
to
resign
the
gay
assemblies
of
parisâ€”where
her
beauty
was
generally
unrivalled
and
won
the
applause
to
which
her
wit
had
but
feeble
claimâ€”for
the
twilight
canopy
of
woods
the
lonely
grandeur
of
mountains
and
the
solemnity
of
gothic
halls
and
of
long
long
galleries
which
echoed
only
the
solitary
step
of
a
domestic
or
the
measured
clink
that
ascended
from
the
great
clockâ€”the
ancient
monitor
of
the
hall
below
from
these
melancholy
expectations
she
endeavoured
to
relieve
her
spirits
by
recollecting
all
that
she
had
ever
heard
concerning
the
joyous
vintage
of
the
plains
of
languedoc
but
there
alas
no
airy
forms
would
bound
to
the
gay
melody
of
parisian
dances
and
a
view
of
the
rustic
festivities
of
peasants
could
afford
little
pleasure
to
a
heart
in
which
even
the
feelings
of
ordinary
benevolence
had
long
since
decayed
under
the
corruptions
of
luxury
the
count
had
a
son
and
a
daughter
the
children
of
a
former
marriage
who
he
designed
should
accompany
him
to
the
south
of
france
henri
who
was
in
his
twentieth
year
was
in
the
french
service
and
blanche
who
was
not
yet
eighteen
had
been
hitherto
confined
to
the
convent
where
she
had
been
placed
immediately
on
her
fatherâ€™s
second
marriage
the
present
countess
who
had
neither
sufficient
ability
nor
inclination
to
superintend
the
education
of
her
daughter-in-law
had
advised
this
step
and
the
dread
of
superior
beauty
had
since
urged
her
to
employ
every
art
that
might
prevail
on
the
count
to
prolong
the
period
of
blancheâ€™s
seclusion
it
was
therefore
with
extreme
mortification
that
she
now
understood
he
would
no
longer
submit
on
this
subject
yet
it
afforded
her
some
consolation
to
consider
that
though
the
lady
blanche
would
emerge
from
her
convent
the
shades
of
the
country
would
for
some
time
veil
her
beauty
from
the
public
eye
on
the
morning
which
commenced
the
journey
the
postillions
stopped
at
the
convent
by
the
countâ€™s
order
to
take
up
blanche
whose
heart
beat
with
delight
at
the
prospect
of
novelty
and
freedom
now
before
her
as
the
time
of
her
departure
drew
nigh
her
impatience
had
increased
and
the
last
night
during
which
she
counted
every
note
of
every
hour
had
appeared
the
most
tedious
of
any
she
had
ever
known
the
morning
light
at
length
dawned
the
matin-bell
rang
she
heard
the
nuns
descending
from
their
chambers
and
she
started
from
a
sleepless
pillow
to
welcome
the
day
which
was
to
emancipate
her
from
the
severities
of
a
cloister
and
introduce
her
to
a
world
where
pleasure
was
ever
smiling
and
goodness
ever
blessedâ€”where
in
short
nothing
but
pleasure
and
goodness
reigned
when
the
bell
of
the
great
gate
rang
and
the
sound
was
followed
by
that
of
carriage
wheels
she
ran
with
a
palpitating
heart
to
her
lattice
and
perceiving
her
fatherâ€™s
carriage
in
the
court
below
danced
with
airy
steps
along
the
gallery
where
she
was
met
by
a
nun
with
a
summons
from
the
abbess
in
the
next
moment
she
was
in
the
parlour
and
in
the
presence
of
the
countess
who
now
appeared
to
her
as
an
angel
that
was
to
lead
her
into
happiness
but
the
emotions
of
the
countess
on
beholding
her
were
not
in
unison
with
those
of
blanche
who
had
never
appeared
so
lovely
as
at
this
moment
when
her
countenance
animated
by
the
lightning
smile
of
joy
glowed
with
the
beauty
of
happy
innocence
after
conversing
for
a
few
minutes
with
the
abbess
the
countess
rose
to
go
this
was
the
moment
which
blanche
had
anticipated
with
such
eager
expectation
the
summit
from
which
she
looked
down
upon
the
fairy-land
of
happiness
and
surveyed
all
its
enchantment
was
it
a
moment
then
for
tears
of
regret
yet
it
was
so
she
turned
with
an
altered
and
dejected
countenance
to
her
young
companions
who
were
come
to
bid
her
farewell
and
wept
even
my
lady
abbess
so
stately
and
so
solemn
she
saluted
with
a
degree
of
sorrow
which
an
hour
before
she
would
have
believed
it
impossible
to
feel
and
which
may
be
accounted
for
by
considering
how
reluctantly
we
all
part
even
with
unpleasing
objects
when
the
separation
is
consciously
for
ever
again
she
kissed
the
poor
nuns
and
then
followed
the
countess
from
that
spot
with
tears
which
she
expected
to
leave
only
with
smiles
but
the
presence
of
her
father
and
the
variety
of
objects
on
the
road
soon
engaged
her
attention
and
dissipated
the
shade
which
tender
regret
had
thrown
upon
her
spirits
inattentive
to
a
conversation
which
was
passing
between
the
countess
and
a
mademoiselle
bearn
her
friend
blanche
sat
lost
in
pleasing
reverie
as
she
watched
the
clouds
floating
silently
along
the
blue
expanse
now
veiling
the
sun
and
stretching
their
shadows
along
the
distant
scene
and
then
disclosing
all
his
brightness
the
journey
continued
to
give
blanche
inexpressible
delight
for
new
scenes
of
nature
were
every
instant
opening
to
her
view
and
her
fancy
became
stored
with
gay
and
beautiful
imagery
it
was
on
the
evening
of
the
seventh
day
that
the
travellers
came
within
view
of
chã¢teau-le-blanc
the
romantic
beauty
of
whose
situation
strongly
impressed
the
imagination
of
blanche
who
observed
with
sublime
astonishment
the
pyrenean
mountains
which
had
been
seen
only
at
a
distance
during
the
day
now
rising
within
a
few
leagues
with
their
wild
cliffs
and
immense
precipices
which
the
evening
clouds
floating
round
them
now
disclosed
and
again
veiled
the
setting
rays
that
tinged
their
snowy
summits
with
a
roseate
hue
touched
their
lower
points
with
various
colouring
while
the
bluish
tint
that
pervaded
their
shadowy
recesses
gave
the
strength
of
contrast
to
the
splendour
of
light
the
plains
of
languedoc
blushing
with
the
purple
vine
and
diversified
with
groves
of
mulberry
almond
and
olives
spread
far
to
the
north
and
the
east
to
the
south
appeared
the
mediterranean
clear
as
crystal
and
blue
as
the
heavens
it
reflected
bearing
on
its
bosom
vessels
whose
white
sails
caught
the
sunbeams
and
gave
animation
to
the
scene
on
a
high
promontory
washed
by
the
waters
of
the
mediterranean
stood
her
fatherâ€™s
mansion
almost
secluded
from
the
eye
by
woods
of
intermingled
pine
oak
and
chesnut
which
crowned
the
eminence
and
sloped
towards
the
plains
on
one
side
while
on
the
other
they
extended
to
a
considerable
distance
along
the
sea-shores
as
blanche
drew
nearer
the
gothic
features
of
this
ancient
mansion
successively
appearedâ€”first
an
embattled
turret
rising
above
the
treesâ€”then
the
broken
arch
of
an
immense
gateway
retiring
beyond
them
and
she
almost
fancied
herself
approaching
a
castle
such
as
is
often
celebrated
in
early
story
where
the
knights
look
out
from
the
battlements
on
some
champion
below
who
clothed
in
black
armour
comes
with
his
companions
to
rescue
the
fair
lady
of
his
love
from
the
oppression
of
his
rival
a
sort
of
legends
to
which
she
had
once
or
twice
obtained
access
in
the
library
of
her
convent
that
like
many
others
belonging
to
the
monks
was
stored
with
these
reliques
of
romantic
fiction
the
carriages
stopped
at
a
gate
which
led
into
the
domain
of
the
chã¢teau
but
which
was
now
fastened
and
the
great
bell
that
had
formerly
served
to
announce
the
arrival
of
strangers
having
long
since
fallen
from
its
station
a
servant
climbed
over
a
ruined
part
of
the
adjoining
wall
to
give
notice
to
those
within
of
the
arrival
of
their
lord
as
blanche
leaned
from
the
coach
window
she
resigned
herself
to
the
sweet
and
gentle
emotions
which
the
hour
and
the
scenery
awakened
the
sun
had
now
left
the
earth
and
twilight
began
to
darken
the
mountains
while
the
distant
waters
reflecting
the
blush
that
still
glowed
in
the
west
appeared
like
a
line
of
light
skirting
the
horizon
the
low
murmur
of
waves
breaking
on
the
shore
came
in
the
breeze
and
now
and
then
the
melancholy
dashing
of
oars
was
feebly
heard
from
a
distance
she
was
suffered
to
indulge
her
pensive
mood
for
the
thoughts
of
the
rest
of
the
party
were
silently
engaged
upon
the
subjects
of
their
several
interests
meanwhile
the
countess
reflecting
with
regret
upon
the
gay
parties
she
had
left
at
paris
surveyed
with
disgust
what
she
thought
the
gloomy
woods
and
solitary
wildness
of
the
scene
and
shrinking
from
the
prospect
of
being
shut
up
in
an
old
castle
was
prepared
to
meet
every
object
with
displeasure
the
feelings
of
henri
were
somewhat
similar
to
those
of
the
countess
he
gave
a
mournful
sigh
to
the
delights
of
the
capital
and
to
the
remembrance
of
a
lady
who
he
believed
had
engaged
his
affections
and
who
had
certainly
fascinated
his
imagination
but
the
surrounding
country
and
the
mode
of
life
on
which
he
was
entering
had
for
him
at
least
the
charm
of
novelty
and
his
regret
was
softened
by
the
gay
expectations
of
youth
the
gates
being
at
length
unbarred
the
carriage
moved
slowly
on
under
spreading
chesnuts
that
almost
excluded
the
remains
of
day
following
what
had
been
formerly
a
road
but
which
now
overgrown
with
luxuriant
vegetation
could
be
traced
only
by
the
boundary
formed
by
trees
on
either
side
and
which
wound
for
near
half
a
mile
among
the
woods
before
it
reached
the
chã¢teau
this
was
the
very
avenue
that
st
aubert
and
emily
had
formerly
entered
on
their
first
arrival
in
the
neighbourhood
with
the
hope
of
finding
a
house
that
would
receive
them
for
the
night
and
had
so
abruptly
quitted
on
perceiving
the
wildness
of
the
place
and
a
figure
which
the
postillion
had
fancied
was
a
robber
â€œwhat
a
dismal
place
is
thisâ€
exclaimed
the
countess
as
the
carriage
penetrated
the
deeper
recesses
of
the
woods
â€œsurely
my
lord
you
do
not
mean
to
pass
all
the
autumn
in
this
barbarous
spot
one
ought
to
bring
hither
a
cup
of
the
waters
of
lethe
that
the
remembrance
of
pleasanter
scenes
may
not
heighten
at
least
the
natural
dreariness
of
theseâ€
â€œi
shall
be
governed
by
circumstances
madamâ€
said
the
count
â€œthis
barbarous
spot
was
inhabited
by
my
ancestorsâ€
the
carriage
now
stopped
at
the
chã¢teau
where
at
the
door
of
the
great
hall
appeared
the
old
steward
and
the
parisian
servants
who
had
been
sent
to
prepare
the
chã¢teau
waiting
to
receive
their
lord
lady
blanche
now
perceived
that
the
edifice
was
not
built
entirely
in
the
gothic
style
but
that
it
had
additions
of
a
more
modern
date
the
large
and
gloomy
hall
however
into
which
she
now
entered
was
entirely
gothic
and
sumptuous
tapestry
which
it
was
now
too
dark
to
distinguish
hung
upon
the
walls
and
depictured
scenes
from
some
of
the
ancient
provenã§al
romances
a
vast
gothic
window
embroidered
with
clematis
and
eglantine
that
ascended
to
the
south
led
the
eye
now
that
the
casements
were
thrown
open
through
this
verdant
shade
over
a
sloping
lawn
to
the
tops
of
dark
woods
that
hung
upon
the
brow
of
the
promontory
beyond
appeared
the
waters
of
the
mediterranean
stretching
far
to
the
south
and
to
the
east
where
they
were
lost
in
the
horizon
while
to
the
north-east
they
were
bounded
by
the
luxuriant
shores
of
languedoc
and
provence
enriched
with
wood
and
gay
with
vines
and
sloping
pastures
and
to
the
south-west
by
the
majestic
pyrenees
now
fading
from
the
eye
beneath
the
gradual
gloom
blanche
as
she
crossed
the
hall
stopped
a
moment
to
observe
this
lovely
prospect
which
the
evening
twilight
obscured
yet
did
not
conceal
but
she
was
quickly
awakened
from
the
complacent
delight
which
this
scene
had
diffused
upon
her
mind
by
the
countess
who
discontented
with
every
object
around
and
impatient
for
refreshment
and
repose
hastened
forward
to
a
large
parlour
whose
cedar
wainscot
narrow
pointed
casements
and
dark
ceiling
of
carved
cypress
wood
gave
it
an
aspect
of
peculiar
gloom
which
the
dingy
green
velvet
of
the
chairs
and
couches
fringed
with
tarnished
gold
had
once
been
designed
to
enliven
while
the
countess
enquired
for
refreshment
the
count
attended
by
his
son
went
to
look
over
some
part
of
the
chã¢teau
and
lady
blanche
reluctantly
remained
to
witness
the
discontent
and
ill-humour
of
her
step-mother
â€œhow
long
have
you
lived
in
this
desolate
placeâ€
said
her
ladyship
to
the
old
housekeeper
who
came
to
pay
her
duty
â€œabove
twenty
years
your
ladyship
on
the
next
feast
of
st
jeromeâ€
â€œhow
happened
it
that
you
have
lived
here
so
long
and
almost
alone
too
i
understood
that
the
chã¢teau
had
been
shut
up
for
some
yearsâ€
â€œyes
madam
it
was
for
many
years
after
my
late
lord
the
count
went
to
the
wars
but
it
is
above
twenty
years
since
i
and
my
husband
came
into
his
service
the
place
is
so
large
and
has
of
late
been
so
lonely
that
we
were
lost
in
it
and
after
some
time
we
went
to
live
in
a
cottage
at
the
end
of
the
woods
near
some
of
the
tenants
and
came
to
look
after
the
chã¢teau
every
now
and
then
when
my
lord
returned
to
france
from
the
wars
he
took
a
dislike
to
the
place
and
never
came
to
live
here
again
and
so
he
was
satisfied
with
our
remaining
at
the
cottage
alasâ€”alas
how
the
chã¢teau
is
changed
from
what
it
once
was
what
delight
my
late
lady
used
to
take
in
it
i
well
remember
when
she
came
here
a
bride
and
how
fine
it
was
now
it
has
been
neglected
so
long
and
is
gone
into
such
decay
i
shall
never
see
those
days
againâ€
the
countess
appearing
to
be
somewhat
offended
by
the
thoughtless
simplicity
with
which
the
old
woman
regretted
former
times
dorothã©e
addedâ€”â€œbut
the
chã¢teau
will
now
be
inhabited
and
cheerful
again
not
all
the
world
could
tempt
me
to
live
in
it
aloneâ€
â€œwell
the
experiment
will
not
be
made
i
believeâ€
said
the
countess
displeased
that
her
own
silence
had
been
unable
to
awe
the
loquacity
of
this
rustic
old
housekeeper
now
spared
from
further
attendance
by
the
entrance
of
the
count
who
said
he
had
been
viewing
part
of
the
chã¢teau
and
found
that
it
would
require
considerable
repairs
and
some
alterations
before
it
would
be
perfectly
comfortable
as
a
place
of
residence
â€œi
am
sorry
to
hear
it
my
lordâ€
replied
the
countess
â€œand
why
sorry
madamâ€
â€œbecause
the
place
will
ill
repay
your
trouble
and
were
it
even
a
paradise
it
would
be
insufferable
at
such
a
distance
from
parisâ€
the
count
made
no
reply
but
walked
abruptly
to
a
window
â€œthere
are
windows
my
lord
but
they
neither
admit
entertainment
nor
light
they
show
only
a
scene
of
savage
natureâ€
â€œi
am
at
a
loss
madamâ€
said
the
count
â€œto
conjecture
what
you
mean
by
savage
nature
do
those
plains
or
those
woods
or
that
fine
expanse
of
water
deserve
the
nameâ€
â€œthose
mountains
certainly
do
my
lordâ€
rejoined
the
countess
pointing
to
the
pyrenees
â€œand
this
chã¢teau
though
not
a
work
of
rude
nature
is
to
my
taste
at
least
one
of
savage
artâ€
the
count
coloured
highly
â€œthis
place
madam
was
the
work
of
my
ancestorsâ€
said
he
â€œand
you
must
allow
me
to
say
that
your
present
conversation
discovers
neither
good
taste
nor
good
mannersâ€
blanche
now
shocked
at
an
altercation
which
appeared
to
be
increasing
to
a
serious
disagreement
rose
to
leave
the
room
when
her
motherâ€™s
woman
entered
it
and
the
countess
immediately
desiring
to
be
shown
to
her
own
apartment
withdrew
attended
by
mademoiselle
bearn
lady
blanche
it
being
not
yet
dark
took
this
opportunity
of
exploring
new
scenes
and
leaving
the
parlour
she
passed
from
the
hall
into
a
wide
gallery
whose
walls
were
decorated
by
marble
pilasters
which
supported
an
arched
roof
composed
of
a
rich
mosaic
work
through
a
distant
window
that
seemed
to
terminate
the
gallery
were
seen
the
purple
clouds
of
evening
and
a
landscape
whose
features
thinly
veiled
in
twilight
no
longer
appeared
distinctly
but
blended
into
one
grand
mass
stretched
to
the
horizon
coloured
only
with
a
tint
of
solemn
grey
the
gallery
terminated
in
a
saloon
to
which
the
window
she
had
seen
through
an
open
door
belonged
but
the
increasing
dusk
permitted
her
only
an
imperfect
view
of
this
apartment
which
seemed
to
be
magnificent
and
of
modern
architecture
though
it
had
been
either
suffered
to
fall
into
decay
or
had
never
been
properly
finished
the
windows
which
were
numerous
and
large
descended
low
and
afforded
a
very
extensive
and
what
blancheâ€™s
fancy
represented
to
be
a
very
lovely
prospect
and
she
stood
for
some
time
surveying
the
grey
obscurity
and
depicturing
imaginary
woods
and
mountains
valleys
and
rivers
on
this
scene
of
night
her
solemn
sensations
rather
assisted
than
interrupted
by
the
distant
bark
of
a
watch-dog
and
by
the
breeze
as
it
trembled
upon
the
light
foliage
of
the
shrubs
now
and
then
appeared
for
a
moment
among
the
woods
a
cottage
light
and
at
length
was
heard
afar
off
the
evening
bell
of
a
convent
dying
on
the
air
when
she
withdrew
her
thoughts
from
these
subjects
of
fanciful
delight
the
gloom
and
silence
of
the
saloon
somewhat
awed
her
and
having
sought
the
door
of
the
gallery
and
pursued
for
a
considerable
time
a
dark
passage
she
came
to
a
hall
but
one
totally
different
from
that
she
had
formerly
seen
by
the
twilight
admitted
through
an
open
portico
she
could
just
distinguish
this
apartment
to
be
of
very
light
and
airy
architecture
and
that
it
was
paved
with
white
marble
pillars
of
which
supported
the
roof
that
rose
into
arches
built
in
the
moorish
style
while
blanche
stood
on
the
steps
of
this
portico
the
moon
rose
over
the
sea
and
gradually
disclosed
in
partial
light
the
beauties
of
the
eminence
on
which
she
stood
whence
a
lawn
now
rude
and
overgrown
with
high
grass
sloped
to
the
woods
that
almost
surrounding
the
chã¢teau
extended
in
a
grand
sweep
down
the
southern
sides
of
the
promontory
to
the
very
margin
of
the
ocean
beyond
the
woods
on
the
north-side
appeared
a
long
tract
of
the
plains
of
languedoc
and
to
the
east
the
landscape
she
had
before
dimly
seen
with
the
towers
of
a
monastery
illumined
by
the
moon
rising
over
dark
groves
the
soft
and
shadowy
tint
that
overspread
the
scene
the
waves
undulating
in
the
moonlight
and
their
low
and
measured
murmurs
on
the
beach
were
circumstances
that
united
to
elevate
the
unaccustomed
mind
of
blanche
to
enthusiasm
â€œand
have
i
lived
in
this
glorious
world
so
longâ€
said
she
â€œand
never
till
now
beheld
such
a
prospectâ€”never
experienced
these
delights
every
peasant
girl
on
my
fatherâ€™s
domain
has
viewed
from
her
infancy
the
face
of
nature
has
ranged
at
liberty
her
romantic
wilds
while
i
have
been
shut
in
a
cloister
from
the
view
of
these
beautiful
appearances
which
were
designed
to
enchant
all
eyes
and
awaken
all
hearts
how
can
the
poor
nuns
and
friars
feel
the
full
fervour
of
devotion
if
they
never
see
the
sun
rise
or
set
never
till
this
evening
did
i
know
what
true
devotion
is
for
never
before
did
i
see
the
sun
sink
below
the
vast
earth
tomorrow
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
will
see
it
rise
o
who
would
live
in
paris
to
look
upon
black
walls
and
dirty
streets
when
in
the
country
they
might
gaze
on
the
blue
heavens
and
all
the
green
earthâ€
this
enthusiastic
soliloquy
was
interrupted
by
a
rustling
noise
in
the
hall
and
while
the
loneliness
of
the
place
made
her
sensible
to
fear
she
thought
she
perceived
something
moving
between
the
pillars
for
a
moment
she
continued
silently
observing
it
till
ashamed
of
her
ridiculous
apprehensions
she
recollected
courage
enough
to
demand
who
was
there
â€œo
my
young
lady
is
it
youâ€
said
the
old
housekeeper
who
was
come
to
shut
the
windows
â€œi
am
glad
it
is
youâ€
the
manner
in
which
she
spoke
this
with
a
faint
breath
rather
surprised
blanche
who
said
â€œyou
seemed
frightened
dorothã©e
what
is
the
matterâ€
â€œno
not
frightened
maâ€™amselleâ€
replied
dorothã©e
hesitating
and
trying
to
appear
composed
â€œbut
i
am
old
andâ€”a
little
matter
startles
meâ€
the
lady
blanche
smiled
at
the
distinction
â€œi
am
glad
that
my
lord
the
count
is
come
to
live
at
the
chã¢teau
maâ€™amselleâ€
continued
dorothã©e
â€œfor
it
has
been
many
a
year
deserted
and
dreary
enough
now
the
place
will
look
a
little
as
it
used
to
do
when
my
poor
lady
was
aliveâ€
blanche
enquired
how
long
it
was
since
the
marchioness
died
â€œalas
my
ladyâ€
replied
dorothã©e
â€œso
longâ€”that
i
have
ceased
to
count
the
years
the
place
to
my
mind
has
mourned
ever
since
and
i
am
sure
my
lordâ€™s
vassals
have
but
you
have
lost
yourself
maâ€™amselleâ€”shall
i
show
you
to
the
other
side
of
the
chã¢teauâ€
blanche
enquired
how
long
this
part
of
the
edifice
had
been
built
â€œsoon
after
my
lordâ€™s
marriage
maâ€™amâ€
replied
dorothã©e
â€œthe
place
was
large
enough
without
this
addition
for
many
rooms
of
the
old
building
were
even
then
never
made
use
of
and
my
lord
had
a
princely
household
too
but
he
thought
the
ancient
mansion
gloomy
and
gloomy
enough
it
isâ€
lady
blanche
now
desired
to
be
shown
to
the
inhabited
part
of
the
chã¢teau
and
as
the
passages
were
entirely
dark
dorothã©e
conducted
her
along
the
edge
of
the
lawn
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
edifice
where
a
door
opening
into
the
great
hall
she
was
met
by
mademoiselle
bearn
â€œwhere
have
you
been
so
longâ€
said
she
â€œi
had
begun
to
think
some
wonderful
adventure
had
befallen
you
and
that
the
giant
of
this
enchanted
castle
or
the
ghost
which
no
doubt
haunts
it
had
conveyed
you
through
a
trap-door
into
some
subterranean
vault
whence
you
were
never
to
returnâ€
â€œnoâ€
replied
blanche
laughingly
â€œyou
seem
to
love
adventures
so
well
that
i
leave
them
for
you
to
achieveâ€
â€œwell
i
am
willing
to
achieve
them
provided
i
am
allowed
to
describe
themâ€
â€œmy
dear
mademoiselle
bearnâ€
said
henri
as
he
met
her
at
the
door
of
the
parlour
â€œno
ghost
of
these
days
would
be
so
savage
as
to
impose
silence
on
you
our
ghosts
are
more
civilized
than
to
condemn
a
lady
to
a
purgatory
severer
even
than
their
own
be
it
what
it
mayâ€
mademoiselle
bearn
replied
only
by
a
laugh
and
the
count
now
entering
the
room
supper
was
served
during
which
he
spoke
little
frequently
appeared
to
be
abstracted
from
the
company
and
more
than
once
remarked
that
the
place
was
greatly
altered
since
he
had
last
seen
it
â€œmany
years
have
intervened
since
that
periodâ€
said
he
â€œand
though
the
grand
features
of
the
scenery
admit
of
no
change
they
impress
me
with
sensations
very
different
from
those
i
formerly
experiencedâ€
â€œdid
these
scenes
sirâ€
said
blanche
â€œever
appear
more
lovely
than
they
do
now
to
me
this
seems
hardly
possibleâ€
the
count
regarding
her
with
a
melancholy
smile
said
â€œthey
once
were
as
delightful
to
me
as
they
are
now
to
you
the
landscape
is
not
changed
but
time
has
changed
me
from
my
mind
the
illusion
which
gave
spirit
to
the
colouring
of
nature
is
fading
fast
if
you
live
my
dear
blanche
to
revisit
this
spot
at
the
distance
of
many
years
you
will
perhaps
remember
and
understand
the
feelings
of
your
fatherâ€
lady
blanche
affected
by
these
words
remained
silent
she
looked
forward
to
the
period
which
the
count
anticipated
and
considering
that
he
who
now
spoke
would
then
probably
be
no
more
her
eyes
bent
to
the
ground
were
filed
with
tears
she
gave
her
hand
to
her
father
who
smiling
affectionately
rose
from
his
chair
and
went
to
a
window
to
conceal
his
emotion
the
fatigues
of
the
day
made
the
party
separate
at
an
early
hour
when
blanche
retired
through
a
long
oak
gallery
to
her
chamber
whose
spacious
and
lofty
walls
high
antiquated
casements
and
what
was
the
effect
of
these
its
gloomy
air
did
not
reconcile
her
to
its
remote
situation
in
this
ancient
building
the
furniture
also
was
of
ancient
date
the
bed
was
of
blue
damask
trimmed
with
tarnished
gold
lace
and
its
lofty
tester
rose
in
the
form
of
a
canopy
whence
the
curtains
descended
like
those
of
such
tents
as
are
sometimes
represented
in
old
pictures
and
indeed
much
resembling
those
exhibited
on
the
faded
tapestry
with
which
the
chamber
was
hung
to
blanche
every
object
here
was
matter
of
curiosity
and
taking
the
light
from
her
woman
to
examine
the
tapestry
she
perceived
that
it
represented
scenes
from
the
wars
of
troy
though
the
almost
colourless
worsted
now
mocked
the
glowing
actions
they
once
had
painted
she
laughed
at
the
ludicrous
absurdity
she
observed
till
recollecting
that
the
hands
which
had
wove
it
were
like
the
poet
whose
thoughts
of
fire
they
had
attempted
to
express
long
since
mouldered
into
dust
a
train
of
melancholy
ideas
passed
over
her
mind
and
she
almost
wept
having
given
her
woman
a
strict
injunction
to
awaken
her
before
sunrise
she
dismissed
her
and
then
to
dissipate
the
gloom
which
reflection
had
cast
upon
her
spirits
opened
one
of
the
high
casements
and
was
again
cheered
by
the
face
of
living
nature
the
shadowy
earth
the
air
and
oceanâ€”all
was
still
along
the
deep
serene
of
the
heavens
a
few
light
clouds
floated
slowly
through
whose
skirts
the
stars
now
seemed
to
tremble
and
now
to
emerge
with
purer
splendour
blancheâ€™s
thoughts
arose
involuntarily
to
the
great
author
of
the
sublime
objects
she
contemplated
and
she
breathed
a
prayer
of
finer
devotion
than
any
she
had
ever
uttered
beneath
the
vaulted
roof
of
a
cloister
at
this
casement
she
remained
till
the
glooms
of
midnight
were
stretched
over
the
prospect
she
then
retired
to
her
pillow
and
â€œwith
gay
visions
of
tomorrowâ€
to
those
sweet
slumbers
which
health
and
happy
innocence
only
know
tomorrow
to
fresh
woods
and
pastures
new
what
transport
to
retrace
our
early
plays
our
easy
bliss
when
each
thing
joy
supplied
the
woods
the
mountains
and
the
warbling
maze
of
the
wild
brooks
thomson
blancheâ€™s
slumbers
continued
till
long
after
the
hour
which
she
had
so
impatiently
anticipated
for
her
woman
fatigued
with
travelling
did
not
call
her
till
breakfast
was
nearly
ready
her
disappointment
however
was
instantly
forgotten
when
on
opening
the
casement
she
saw
on
one
hand
the
wide
sea
sparkling
in
the
morning
rays
with
its
stealing
sails
and
glancing
oars
and
on
the
other
the
fresh
woods
the
plains
far-stretching
and
the
blue
mountains
all
glowing
with
the
splendour
of
day
as
she
inspired
the
pure
breeze
health
spread
a
deeper
blush
upon
her
countenance
and
pleasure
danced
in
her
eyes
â€œwho
could
first
invent
conventsâ€
said
she
â€œand
who
could
first
persuade
people
to
go
into
them
and
to
make
religion
a
pretence
too
where
all
that
should
inspire
it
is
so
carefully
shut
out
god
is
best
pleased
with
the
homage
of
a
grateful
heart
and
when
we
view
his
glories
we
feel
most
grateful
i
never
felt
so
much
devotion
during
the
many
dull
years
i
was
in
the
convent
as
i
have
done
in
the
few
hours
that
i
have
been
here
where
i
need
only
look
on
all
around
meâ€”to
adore
god
in
my
inmost
heartâ€
saying
this
she
left
the
window
bounded
along
the
gallery
and
in
the
next
moment
was
in
the
breakfast
room
where
the
count
was
already
seated
the
cheerfulness
of
a
bright
sunshine
had
dispersed
the
melancholy
glooms
of
his
reflections
a
pleasant
smile
was
on
his
countenance
and
he
spoke
in
an
enlivening
voice
to
blanche
whose
heart
echoed
back
the
tones
henri
and
soon
after
the
countess
with
mademoiselle
bearn
appeared
and
the
whole
party
seemed
to
acknowledge
the
influence
of
the
scene
even
the
countess
was
so
much
reanimated
as
to
receive
the
civilities
of
her
husband
with
complacency
and
but
once
forgot
her
good-humour
which
was
when
she
asked
whether
they
had
any
neighbours
who
were
likely
to
make
this
barbarous
spot

more
tolerable
and
whether
the
count
believed
it
possible
for
her
to
exist
here
without
some
amusement
soon
after
breakfast
the
party
dispersed
the
count
ordering
his
steward
to
attend
him
in
the
library
went
to
survey
the
condition
of
his
premises
and
to
visit
some
of
his
tenants
henri
hastened
with
alacrity
to
the
shore
to
examine
a
boat
that
was
to
bear
them
on
a
little
voyage
in
the
evening
and
to
superintend
the
adjustment
of
a
silk
awning
while
the
countess
attended
by
mademoiselle
bearn
retired
to
an
apartment
on
the
modern
side
of
the
chã¢teau
which
was
fitted
up
with
airy
elegance
and
as
the
windows
opened
upon
balconies
that
fronted
the
sea
she
was
there
saved
from
a
view
of
the
horrid
pyrenees
here
while
she
reclined
on
a
sofa
and
casting
her
languid
eyes
over
the
ocean
which
appeared
beyond
the
wood-tops
indulged
in
the
luxuries
of
ennui
her
companion
read
aloud
a
sentimental
novel
on
some
fashionable
system
of
philosophy
for
the
countess
was
herself
somewhat
of
a
philosopher
especially
as
to
infidelity
and
among
a
certain
circle
her
opinions
were
waited
for
with
impatience
and
received
as
doctrines
the
lady
blanche
meanwhile
hastened
to
indulge
amidst
the
wild
wood-walks
around
the
chã¢teau
her
new
enthusiasm
where
as
she
wandered
under
the
shades
her
gay
spirits
gradually
yielded
to
pensive
complacency
now
she
moved
with
solemn
steps
beneath
the
gloom
of
thickly
interwoven
branches
where
the
fresh
dew
still
hung
upon
every
flower
that
peeped
from
among
the
grass
and
now
tripped
sportively
along
the
path
on
which
the
sunbeams
darted
and
the
checquered
foliage
trembledâ€”where
the
tender
greens
of
the
beech
the
acacia
and
the
mountain-ash
mingling
with
the
solemn
tints
of
the
cedar
the
pine
and
cypress
exhibited
as
fine
a
contrast
of
colouring
as
the
majestic
oak
and
oriental
plane
did
of
form
to
the
feathery
lightness
of
the
cork
tree
and
the
waving
grace
of
the
poplar
having
reached
a
rustic
seat
within
a
deep
recess
of
the
woods
she
rested
awhile
and
as
her
eyes
caught
through
a
distant
opening
a
glimpse
of
the
blue
waters
of
the
mediterranean
with
the
white
sail
gliding
on
its
bosom
or
of
the
broad
mountain
glowing
beneath
the
mid-day
sun
her
mind
experienced
somewhat
of
that
exquisite
delight
which
awakens
the
fancy
and
leads
to
poetry
the
hum
of
bees
alone
broke
the
stillness
around
her
as
with
other
insects
of
various
hues
they
sported
gaily
in
the
shade
or
sipped
sweets
from
the
fresh
flowers
and
while
blanche
watched
a
butter-fly
flitting
from
bud
to
bud
she
indulged
herself
in
imagining
the
pleasures
of
its
short
day
till
she
had
composed
the
following
stanzas
the
butter-fly
to
his
love
what
bowery
dell
with
fragrant
breath
courts
thee
to
stay
thy
airy
flight
nor
seek
again
the
purple
heath
so
oft
the
scene
of
gay
delight
long
iâ€™ve
watchâ€™d
iâ€™
the
lilyâ€™s
bell
whose
whiteness
stole
the
morningâ€™s
beam
no
fluttering
sounds
thy
coming
tell
no
waving
wings
at
distance
gleam
but
fountain
fresh
nor
breathing
grove
nor
sunny
mead
nor
blossomâ€™d
tree
so
sweet
as
lilyâ€™s
cell
shall
proveâ€”
the
bower
of
constant
love
and
me
when
april
buds
begin
to
blow
the
prim-rose
and
the
hare-bell
blue
that
on
the
verdant
moss
bank
grow
with
violet
cups
that
weep
in
dew
when
wanton
gales
breathe
through
the
shade
and
shake
the
blooms
and
steal
their
sweets
and
swell
the
song
of
evâ€™ry
glade
i
range
the
forestâ€™s
green
retreats
there
through
the
tangled
wood-walks
play
where
no
rude
urchin
paces
near
where
sparely
peeps
the
sultry
day
and
light
dews
freshen
all
the
air
high
on
a

oft
i

oâ€™er

and

vale
and

oft
evâ€™ry
blushing
flowâ€™ret

that
hangs
its

oâ€™er

rill
but
these
iâ€™ll
leave
to
be
thy
guide
and
show
thee
where
the
jasmine
spreads
her
snowy
leaf
where
may-flowâ€™rs
hide
and
rose-buds
rear
their
peeping
heads
with
me
the
mountainâ€™s
summit
scale
and
taste
the
wild-thymeâ€™s
honied
bloom
whose
fragrance
floating
on
the
gale
oft
leads
me
to
the
cedarâ€™s
gloom
yet
yet
no
sound
comes
in
the
breeze
what
shade
thus
dares
to
tempt
thy
stay
once
me
alone
thou
wishâ€™d
to
please
and
with
me
only
thou
wouldst
stray
but
while
thy
long
delay
i
mourn
and
chide
the
sweet
shades
for
their
guile
thou
mayâ€™st
be
true
and
they
forlorn
and
fairy
favours
court
thy
smile
the
tiny
queen
of
fairy-land
who
knows
thy
speed
hath
sent
thee
far
to
bring
or
ere
the
night-watch
stand
rich
essence
for
her
shadowy
car
perchance
her
acorn-cups
to
fill
with
nectar
from
the
indian
rose
or
gather
near
some
haunted
rill
may-dews
that
lull
to
sleep
loveâ€™s
woes
or
oâ€™er
the
mountains
bade
thee
fly
to
tell
her
fairy
love
to
speed
when
evâ€™ning
steals
upon
the
sky
to
dance
along
the
twilight
mead
but
now
i
see
thee
sailing
low
gay
as
the
brightest
flowâ€™rs
of
spring
thy
coat
of
blue
and
jet
i
know
and
well
thy
gold
and
purple
wing
borne
on
the
gale
thou
comâ€™st
to
me
o
welcome
welcome
to
my
home
in
lilyâ€™s
cell
weâ€™ll
live
in
glee
together
oâ€™er
the
mountains
roam
when
lady
blanche
returned
to
the
chã¢teau
instead
of
going
to
the
apartment
of
the
countess
she
amused
herself
with
wandering
over
that
part
of
the
edifice
which
she
had
not
yet
examined
of
which
the
most
ancient
first
attracted
her
curiosity
for
though
what
she
had
seen
of
the
modern
was
gay
and
elegant
there
was
something
in
the
former
more
interesting
to
her
imagination
having
passed
up
the
great
staircase
and
through
the
oak
gallery
she
entered
upon
a
long
suite
of
chambers
whose
walls
were
either
hung
with
tapestry
or
wainscoted
with
cedar
the
furniture
of
which
looked
almost
as
ancient
as
the
rooms
themselves
the
spacious
fire-places
where
no
mark
of
social
cheer
remained
presented
an
image
of
cold
desolation
and
the
whole
suite
had
so
much
the
air
of
neglect
and
desertion
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
venerable
persons
whose
portraits
hung
upon
the
walls
had
been
the
last
to
inhabit
them
on
leaving
these
rooms
she
found
herself
in
another
gallery
one
end
of
which
was
terminated
by
a
back
staircase
and
the
other
by
a
door
that
seemed
to
communicate
with
the
north-side
of
the
chã¢teau
but
which
being
fastened
she
descended
the
staircase
and
opening
a
door
in
the
wall
a
few
steps
down
found
herself
in
a
small
square
room
that
formed
part
of
the
west
turret
of
the
castle
three
windows
presented
each
a
separate
and
beautiful
prospect
that
to
the
north
overlooking
languedoc
another
to
the
west
the
hills
ascending
towards
the
pyrenees
whose
awful
summits
crowned
the
landscape
and
a
third
fronting
the
south
gave
the
mediterranean
and
a
part
of
the
wild
shores
of
rousillon
to
the
eye
having
left
the
turret
and
descended
the
narrow
staircase
she
found
herself
in
a
dusky
passage
where
she
wandered
unable
to
find
her
way
till
impatience
yielded
to
apprehension
and
she
called
for
assistance
presently
steps
approached
and
light
glimmered
through
a
door
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
passage
which
was
opened
with
caution
by
some
person
who
did
not
venture
beyond
it
and
whom
blanche
observed
in
silence
till
the
door
was
closing
when
she
called
aloud
and
hastening
towards
it
perceived
the
old
housekeeper
â€œdear
maâ€™amselle
is
it
youâ€
said
dorothã©e
â€œhow
could
you
find
your
way
hitherâ€
had
blanche
been
less
occupied
by
her
own
fears
she
would
probably
have
observed
the
strong
expressions
of
terror
and
surprise
on
dorothã©eâ€™s
countenance
who
now
led
her
through
a
long
succession
of
passages
and
rooms
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
uninhabited
for
a
century
till
they
reached
that
appropriated
to
the
housekeeper
where
dorothã©e
entreated
she
would
sit
down
and
take
refreshment
blanche
accepted
the
sweet
meats
offered
to
her
mentioned
her
discovery
of
the
pleasant
turret
and
her
wish
to
appropriate
it
to
her
own
use
whether
dorothã©eâ€™s
taste
was
not
so
sensible
to
the
beauties
of
landscape
as
her
young
ladyâ€™s
or
that
the
constant
view
of
lovely
scenery
had
deadened
it
she
forbore
to
praise
the
subject
of
blancheâ€™s
enthusiasm
which
however
her
silence
did
not
repress
to
lady
blancheâ€™s
enquiry
of
whither
the
door
she
had
found
fastened
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
led
she
replied
that
it
opened
to
a
suite
of
rooms
which
had
not
been
entered
during
many
years
â€œforâ€
added
she
â€œmy
late
lady
died
in
one
of
them
and
i
could
never
find
in
my
heart
to
go
into
them
sinceâ€
blanche
though
she
wished
to
see
these
chambers
forbore
on
observing
that
dorothã©eâ€™s
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
to
ask
her
to
unlock
them
and
soon
after
went
to
dress
for
dinner
at
which
the
whole
party
met
in
good
spirits
and
good
humour
except
the
countess
whose
vacant
mind
overcome
by
the
languor
of
idleness
would
neither
suffer
her
to
be
happy
herself
nor
to
contribute
to
the
happiness
of
others
mademoiselle
bearn
attempting
to
be
witty
directed
her
badinage
against
henri
who
answered
because
he
could
not
well
avoid
it
rather
than
from
any
inclination
to
notice
her
whose
liveliness
sometimes
amused
but
whose
conceit
and
insensibility
often
disgusted
him
the
cheerfulness
with
which
blanche
rejoined
the
party
vanished
on
her
reaching
the
margin
of
the
sea
she
gazed
with
apprehension
upon
the
immense
expanse
of
waters
which
at
a
distance
she
had
beheld
only
with
delight
and
astonishment
and
it
was
by
a
strong
effort
that
she
so
far
overcame
her
fears
as
to
follow
her
father
into
the
boat
as
she
silently
surveyed
the
vast
horizon
bending
round
the
distant
verge
of
the
ocean
an
emotion
of
sublimest
rapture
struggled
to
overcome
a
sense
of
personal
danger
a
light
breeze
played
on
the
water
and
on
the
silk
awning
of
the
boat
and
waved
the
foliage
of
the
receding
woods
that
crowned
the
cliffs
for
many
miles
and
which
the
count
surveyed
with
the
pride
of
conscious
property
as
well
as
with
the
eye
of
taste
at
some
distance
among
these
woods
stood
a
pavilion
which
had
once
been
the
scene
of
social
gaiety
and
which
its
situation
still
made
one
of
romantic
beauty
thither
the
count
had
ordered
coffee
and
other
refreshment
to
be
carried
and
thither
the
sailors
now
steered
their
course
following
the
windings
of
the
shore
round
many
a
woody
promontory
and
circling
bay
while
the
pensive
tones
of
horns
and
other
wind
instruments
played
by
the
attendants
in
a
distant
boat
echoed
among
the
rocks
and
died
along
the
waves
blanche
had
now
subdued
her
fears
a
delightful
tranquillity
stole
over
her
mind
and
held
her
in
silence
and
she
was
too
happy
even
to
remember
the
convent
or
her
former
sorrows
as
subjects
of
comparison
with
her
present
felicity
the
countess
felt
less
unhappy
than
she
had
done
since
the
moment
of
her
leaving
paris
for
her
mind
was
now
under
some
degree
of
restraint
she
feared
to
indulge
its
wayward
humours
and
even
wished
to
recover
the
countâ€™s
good
opinion
on
his
family
and
on
the
surrounding
scene
he
looked
with
tempered
pleasure
and
benevolent
satisfaction
while
his
son
exhibited
the
gay
spirits
of
youth
anticipating
new
delights
and
regretless
of
those
that
were
passed
after
near
an
hourâ€™s
rowing
the
party
landed
and
ascended
a
little
path
overgrown
with
vegetation
at
a
little
distance
from
the
point
of
the
eminence
within
the
shadowy
recess
of
the
woods
appeared
the
pavilion
which
blanche
perceived
as
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
its
portico
between
the
trees
to
be
built
of
variegated
marble
as
she
followed
the
countess
she
often
turned
her
eyes
with
rapture
towards
the
ocean
seen
beneath
the
dark
foliage
far
below
and
from
thence
upon
the
deep
woods
whose
silence
and
impenetrable
gloom
awakened
emotions
more
solemn
but
scarcely
less
delightful
the
pavilion
had
been
prepared
as
far
as
was
possible
on
a
very
short
notice
for
the
reception
of
its
visitors
but
the
faded
colours
of
its
painted
walls
and
ceiling
and
the
decayed
drapery
of
its
once
magnificent
furniture
declared
how
long
it
had
been
neglected
and
abandoned
to
the
empire
of
the
changing
seasons
while
the
party
partook
of
a
collation
of
fruit
and
coffee
the
horns
placed
in
a
distant
part
of
the
woods
where
an
echo
sweetened
and
prolonged
their
melancholy
tones
broke
softly
on
the
stillness
of
the
scene
this
spot
seemed
to
attract
even
the
admiration
of
the
countess
or
perhaps
it
was
merely
the
pleasure
of
planning
furniture
and
decorations
that
made
her
dwell
so
long
on
the
necessity
of
repairing
and
adorning
it
while
the
count
never
happier
than
when
he
saw
her
mind
engaged
by
natural
and
simple
objects
acquiesced
in
all
her
designs
concerning
the
pavilion
the
paintings
on
the
walls
and
coved
ceiling
were
to
be
renewed
the
canopies
and
sofas
were
to
be
of
light
green
damask
marble
statues
of
wood-nymphs
bearing
on
their
heads
baskets
of
living
flowers
were
to
adorn
the
recesses
between
the
windows
which
descending
to
the
ground
were
to
admit
to
every
part
of
the
room
and
it
was
of
octagonal
form
the
various
landscape
one
window
opened
upon
a
romantic
glade
where
the
eye
roved
among
the
woody
recesses
and
the
scene
was
bounded
only
by
a
lengthened
pomp
of
groves
from
another
the
woods
receding
disclosed
the
distant
summits
of
the
pyrenees
a
third
fronted
an
avenue
beyond
which
the
grey
towers
of
chã¢teau-le-blanc
and
a
picturesque
part
of
its
ruin
were
seen
partially
among
the
foliage
while
a
fourth
gave
between
the
trees
a
glimpse
of
the
green
pastures
and
villages
that
diversify
the
banks
of
the
aude
the
mediterranean
with
the
bold
cliffs
that
overlooked
its
shores
were
the
grand
objects
of
a
fifth
window
and
the
others
gave
in
different
points
of
view
the
wild
scenery
of
the
woods
after
wandering
for
some
time
in
these
the
party
returned
to
the
shore
and
embarked
and
the
beauty
of
the
evening
tempting
them
to
extend
their
excursion
they
proceeded
further
up
the
bay
a
dead
calm
had
succeeded
the
light
breeze
that
wafted
them
hither
and
the
men
took
to
their
oars
around
the
waters
were
spread
into
one
vast
expanse
of
polished
mirror
reflecting
the
grey
cliffs
and
feathery
woods
that
over-hung
its
surface
the
glow
of
the
western
horizon
and
the
dark
clouds
that
came
slowly
from
the
east
blanche
loved
to
see
the
dipping
oars
imprint
the
water
and
to
watch
the
spreading
circles
they
left
which
gave
a
tremulous
motion
to
the
reflected
landscape
without
destroying
the
harmony
of
its
features
above
the
darkness
of
the
woods
her
eye
now
caught
a
cluster
of
high
towers
touched
with
the
splendour
of
the
setting
rays
and
soon
after
the
horns
being
then
silent
she
heard
the
faint
swell
of
choral
voices
from
a
distance
â€œwhat
voices
are
those
upon
the
airâ€
said
the
count
looking
round
and
listening
but
the
strain
had
ceased
â€œit
seemed
to
be
a
vesper-hymn
which
i
have
often
heard
in
my
conventâ€
said
blanche
â€œwe
are
near
the
monastery
thenâ€
observed
the
count
and
the
boat
soon
after
doubling
a
lofty
head-land
the
monastery
of
st
claire
appeared
seated
near
the
margin
of
the
sea
where
the
cliffs
suddenly
sinking
formed
a
low
shore
within
a
small
bay
almost
encircled
with
woods
among
which
partial
features
of
the
edifice
were
seenâ€”the
great
gate
and
gothic
window
of
the
hall
the
cloisters
and
the
side
of
a
chapel
more
remote
while
a
venerable
arch
which
had
once
led
to
a
part
of
the
fabric
now
demolished
stood
a
majestic
ruin
detached
from
the
main
building
beyond
which
appeared
a
grand
perspective
of
the
woods
on
the
grey
walls
the
moss
had
fastened
and
round
the
pointed
windows
of
the
chapel
the
ivy
and
the
briony
hung
in
many
a
fantastic
wreath
all
without
was
silent
and
forsaken
but
while
blanche
gazed
with
admiration
on
this
venerable
pile
whose
effect
was
heightened
by
the
strong
lights
and
shadows
thrown
athwart
it
by
a
cloudy
sunset
a
sound
of
many
voices
slowly
chanting
arose
from
within
the
count
bade
his
men
rest
on
their
oars
the
monks
were
singing
the
hymn
of
vespers
and
some
female
voices
mingled
with
the
strain
which
rose
by
soft
degrees
till
the
high
organ
and
the
choral
sounds
swelled
into
full
and
solemn
harmony
the
strain
soon
after
dropped
into
sudden
silence
and
was
renewed
in
a
low
and
still
more
solemn
key
till
at
length
the
holy
chorus
died
away
and
was
heard
no
moreâ€”blanche
sighed
tears
trembled
in
her
eyes
and
her
thoughts
seemed
wafted
with
the
sounds
to
heaven
while
a
rapt
stillness
prevailed
in
the
boat
a
train
of
friars
and
then
of
nuns
veiled
in
white
issued
from
the
cloisters
and
passed
under
the
shade
of
the
woods
to
the
main
body
of
the
edifice
the
countess
was
the
first
of
her
party
to
awaken
from
this
pause
of
silence
â€œthese
dismal
hymns
and
friars
make
one
quite
melancholyâ€
said
she
â€œtwilight
is
coming
on
pray
let
us
return
or
it
will
be
dark
before
we
get
homeâ€
the
count
looking
up
now
perceived
that
the
twilight
of
evening
was
anticipated
by
an
approaching
storm
in
the
east
a
tempest
was
collecting
a
heavy
gloom
came
on
opposing
and
contrasting
the
glowing
splendour
of
the
setting
sun
the
clamorous
sea-fowl
skimmed
in
fleet
circles
upon
the
surface
of
the
sea
dipping
their
light
pinions
in
the
wave
as
they
fled
away
in
search
of
shelter
the
boatmen
pulled
hard
at
their
oars
but
the
thunder
that
now
muttered
at
a
distance
and
the
heavy
drops
that
began
to
dimple
the
water
made
the
count
determine
to
put
back
to
the
monastery
for
shelter
and
the
course
of
the
boat
was
immediately
changed
as
the
clouds
approached
the
west
their
lurid
darkness
changed
to
a
deep
ruddy
glow
which
by
reflection
seemed
to
fire
the
tops
of
the
woods
and
the
shattered
towers
of
the
monastery
the
appearance
of
the
heavens
alarmed
the
countess
and
mademoiselle
bearn
whose
expressions
of
apprehension
distressed
the
count
and
perplexed
his
men
while
blanche
continued
silent
now
agitated
with
fear
and
now
with
admiration
as
she
viewed
the
grandeur
of
the
clouds
and
their
effect
on
the
scenery
and
listened
to
the
long
long
peals
of
thunder
that
rolled
through
the
air
the
boat
having
reached
the
lawn
before
the
monastery
the
count
sent
a
servant
to
announce
his
arrival
and
to
entreat
shelter
of
the
superior
who
soon
after
appeared
at
the
great
gate
attended
by
several
monks
while
the
servant
returned
with
a
message
expressive
at
once
of
hospitality
and
pride
but
of
pride
disguised
in
submission
the
party
immediately
disembarked
and
having
hastily
crossed
the
lawnâ€”for
the
shower
was
now
heavyâ€”were
received
at
the
gate
by
the
superior
who
as
they
entered
stretched
forth
his
hands
and
gave
his
blessing
and
they
passed
into
the
great
hall
where
the
lady
abbess
waited
attended
by
several
nuns
clothed
like
herself
in
black
and
veiled
in
white
the
veil
of
the
abbess
was
however
thrown
half
back
and
discovered
a
countenance
whose
chaste
dignity
was
sweetened
by
the
smile
of
welcome
with
which
she
addressed
the
countess
whom
she
led
with
blanche
and
mademoiselle
bearn
into
the
convent
parlour
while
the
count
and
henri
were
conducted
by
the
superior
to
the
refectory
the
countess
fatigued
and
discontented
received
the
politeness
of
the
abbess
with
careless
haughtiness
and
had
followed
her
with
indolent
steps
to
the
parlour
over
which
the
painted
casements
and
wainscot
of
larch-wood
threw
at
all
times
a
melancholy
shade
and
where
the
gloom
of
evening
now
loured
almost
to
darkness
while
the
lady
abbess
ordered
refreshment
and
conversed
with
the
countess
blanche
withdrew
to
a
window
the
lower
panes
of
which
being
without
painting
allowed
her
to
observe
the
progress
of
the
storm
over
the
mediterranean
whose
dark
waves
that
had
so
lately
slept
now
came
boldly
swelling
in
long
succession
to
the
shore
where
they
burst
in
white
foam
and
threw
up
a
high
spray
over
the
rocks
a
red
sulphureous
tint
overspread
the
long
line
of
clouds
that
hung
above
the
western
horizon
beneath
whose
dark
skirts
the
sun
looking
out
illumined
the
distant
shores
of
languedoc
as
well
as
the
tufted
summits
of
the
nearer
woods
and
shed
a
partial
gleam
on
the
western
waves
the
rest
of
the
scene
was
in
deep
gloom
except
where
a
sunbeam
darting
between
the
clouds
glanced
on
the
white
wings
of
the
sea-fowl
that
circled
high
among
them
or
touched
the
swelling
sail
of
a
vessel
which
was
seen
labouring
in
the
storm
blanche
for
some
time
anxiously
watched
the
progress
of
the
bark
as
it
threw
the
waves
in
foam
around
it
and
as
the
lightnings
flashed
looked
to
the
opening
heavens
with
many
a
sigh
for
the
fate
of
the
poor
mariners
the
sun
at
length
set
and
the
heavy
clouds
which
had
long
impended
dropped
over
the
splendour
of
his
course
the
vessel
however
was
yet
dimly
seen
and
blanche
continued
to
observe
it
till
the
quick
succession
of
flashes
lighting
up
the
gloom
of
the
whole
horizon
warned
her
to
retire
from
the
window
and
she
joined
the
abbess
who
having
exhausted
all
her
topics
of
conversation
with
the
countess
had
now
leisure
to
notice
her
but
their
discourse
was
interrupted
by
tremendous
peals
of
thunder
and
the
bell
of
the
monastery
soon
after
ringing
out
summoned
the
inhabitants
to
prayer
as
blanche
passed
the
window
she
gave
another
look
to
the
ocean
where
by
the
momentary
flash
that
illumined
the
vast
body
of
the
waters
she
distinguished
the
vessel
she
had
observed
before
amidst
a
sea
of
foam
breaking
the
billows
the
mast
now
bowing
to
the
waves
and
then
rising
high
in
air
she
sighed
fervently
as
she
gazed
and
then
followed
the
lady
abbess
and
the
countess
to
the
chapel
meanwhile
some
of
the
countâ€™s
servants
having
gone
by
land
to
the
chã¢teau
for
carriages
returned
soon
after
vespers
had
concluded
when
the
storm
being
somewhat
abated
the
count
and
his
family
returned
home
blanche
was
surprised
to
discover
how
much
the
windings
of
the
shore
had
deceived
her
concerning
the
distance
of
the
chã¢teau
from
the
monastery
whose
vesper
bell
she
had
heard
on
the
preceding
evening
from
the
windows
of
the
west
saloon
and
whose
towers
she
would
also
have
seen
from
thence
had
not
twilight
veiled
them
on
their
arrival
at
the
chã¢teau
the
countess
affecting
more
fatigue
than
she
really
felt
withdrew
to
her
apartment
and
the
count
with
his
daughter
and
henri
went
to
the
supper-room
where
they
had
not
been
long
when
they
heard
in
a
pause
of
the
gust
a
firing
of
guns
which
the
count
understanding
to
be
signals
of
distress
from
some
vessel
in
the
storm
went
to
a
window
that
opened
towards
the
mediterranean
to
observe
further
but
the
sea
was
now
involved
in
utter
darkness
and
the
loud
howlings
of
the
tempest
had
again
overcome
every
other
sound
blanche
remembering
the
bark
which
she
had
before
seen
now
joined
her
father
with
trembling
anxiety
in
a
few
moments
the
report
of
guns
was
again
borne
along
the
wind
and
as
suddenly
wafted
away
a
tremendous
burst
of
thunder
followed
and
in
the
flash
that
had
preceded
it
and
which
seemed
to
quiver
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
waters
a
vessel
was
discovered
tossing
amidst
the
white
foam
of
the
waves
at
some
distance
from
the
shore
impenetrable
darkness
again
involved
the
scene
but
soon
a
second
flash
showed
the
bark
with
one
sail
unfurled
driving
towards
the
coast
blanche
hung
upon
her
fatherâ€™s
arm
with
looks
full
of
the
agony
of
united
terror
and
pity
which
were
unnecessary
to
awaken
the
heart
of
the
count
who
gazed
upon
the
sea
with
a
piteous
expression
and
perceiving
that
no
boat
could
live
in
the
storm
forbore
to
send
one
but
he
gave
orders
to
his
people
to
carry
torches
out
upon
the
cliffs
hoping
they
might
prove
a
kind
of
beacon
to
the
vessel
or
at
least
warn
the
crew
of
the
rocks
they
were
approaching
while
henri
went
out
to
direct
on
what
part
of
the
cliffs
the
lights
should
appear
blanche
remained
with
her
father
at
the
window
catching
every
now
and
then
as
the
lightnings
flashed
a
glimpse
of
the
vessel
and
she
soon
saw
with
reviving
hope
the
torches
flaming
on
the
blackness
of
night
and
as
they
waved
over
the
cliffs
casting
a
red
gleam
on
the
gasping
billows
when
the
firing
of
guns
was
repeated
the
torches
were
tossed
high
in
the
air
as
if
answering
the
signal
and
the
firing
was
then
redoubled
but
though
the
wind
bore
the
sound
away
she
fancied
as
the
lightnings
glanced
that
the
vessel
was
much
nearer
the
shore
the
countâ€™s
servants
were
now
seen
running
to
and
fro
on
the
rocks
some
venturing
almost
to
the
point
of
the
crags
and
bending
over
held
out
their
torches
fastened
to
long
poles
while
others
whose
steps
could
be
traced
only
by
the
course
of
the
lights
descended
the
steep
and
dangerous
path
that
wound
to
the
margin
of
the
sea
and
with
loud
halloos
hailed
the
mariners
whose
shrill
whistle
and
then
feeble
voices
were
heard
at
intervals
mingling
with
the
storm
sudden
shouts
from
the
people
on
the
rocks
increased
the
anxiety
of
blanche
to
an
almost
intolerable
degree
but
her
suspense
concerning
the
fate
of
the
mariners
was
soon
over
when
henri
running
breathless
into
the
room
told
that
the
vessel
was
anchored
in
the
bay
below
but
in
so
shattered
a
condition
that
it
was
feared
she
would
part
before
the
crew
could
disembark
the
count
immediately
gave
orders
for
his
own
boats
to
assist
in
bringing
them
to
shore
and
that
such
of
these
unfortunate
strangers
as
could
not
be
accommodated
in
the
adjacent
hamlet
should
be
entertained
at
the
chã¢teau
among
the
latter
were
emily
st
aubert
monsieur
du
pont
ludovico
and
annette
who
having
embarked
at
leghorn
and
reached
marseilles
were
from
thence
crossing
the
gulf
of
lyons
when
this
storm
overtook
them
they
were
received
by
the
count
with
his
usual
benignity
who
though
emily
wished
to
have
proceeded
immediately
to
the
monastery
of
st
claire
would
not
allow
her
to
leave
the
chã¢teau
that
night
and
indeed
the
terror
and
fatigue
she
had
suffered
would
scarcely
have
permitted
her
to
go
farther
in
monsieur
du
pont
the
count
discovered
an
old
acquaintance
and
much
joy
and
congratulation
passed
between
them
after
which
emily
was
introduced
by
name
to
the
countâ€™s
family
whose
hospitable
benevolence
dissipated
the
little
embarrassment
which
her
situation
had
occasioned
her
and
the
party
were
soon
seated
at
the
supper-table
the
unaffected
kindness
of
blanche
and
the
lively
joy
she
expressed
on
the
escape
of
the
strangers
for
whom
her
pity
had
been
so
much
interested
gradually
revived
emilyâ€™s
languid
spirits
and
du
pont
relieved
from
his
terrors
for
her
and
for
himself
felt
the
full
contrast
between
his
late
situation
on
a
dark
and
tremendous
ocean
and
his
present
one
in
a
cheerful
mansion
where
he
was
surrounded
with
plenty
elegance
and
smiles
of
welcome
annette
meanwhile
in
the
servantsâ€™
hall
was
telling
of
all
the
dangers
she
had
encountered
and
congratulating
herself
so
heartily
upon
her
own
and
ludovicoâ€™s
escape
and
on
her
present
comforts
that
she
often
made
all
that
part
of
the
chã¢teau
ring
with
merriment
and
laughter
ludovicoâ€™s
spirits
were
as
gay
as
her
own
but
he
had
discretion
enough
to
restrain
them
and
tried
to
check
hers
though
in
vain
till
her
laughter
at
length
ascended
to
my
ladyâ€™s
chamber
who
sent
to
enquire
what
occasioned
so
much
uproar
in
the
chã¢teau
and
to
command
silence
emily
withdrew
early
to
seek
the
repose
she
so
much
required
but
her
pillow
was
long
a
sleepless
one
on
this
her
return
to
her
native
country
many
interesting
remembrances
were
awakened
all
the
events
and
sufferings
she
had
experienced
since
she
quitted
it
came
in
long
succession
to
her
fancy
and
were
chased
only
by
the
image
of
valancourt
with
whom
to
believe
herself
once
more
in
the
same
land
after
they
had
been
so
long
and
so
distantly
separated
gave
her
emotions
of
indescribable
joy
but
which
afterwards
yielded
to
anxiety
and
apprehension
when
she
considered
the
long
period
that
had
elapsed
since
any
letter
had
passed
between
them
and
how
much
might
have
happened
in
this
interval
to
affect
her
future
peace
but
the
thought
that
valancourt
might
be
now
no
more
or
if
living
might
have
forgotten
her
was
so
very
terrible
to
her
heart
that
she
would
scarcely
suffer
herself
to
pause
upon
the
possibility
she
determined
to
inform
him
on
the
following
day
of
her
arrival
in
france
which
it
was
scarcely
possible
he
could
know
but
by
a
letter
from
herself
and
after
soothing
her
spirits
with
the
hope
of
soon
hearing
that
he
was
well
and
unchanged
in
his
affections
she
at
length
sunk
to
repose
oft
wooâ€™d
the
gleam
of
cynthia
silver-bright
in
cloisters
dim
far
from
the
haunts
of
folly
with
freedom
by
my
side
and
soft-eyâ€™d
melancholy
gray
the
lady
blanche
was
so
much
interested
for
emily
that
upon
hearing
she
was
going
to
reside
in
the
neighbouring
convent
she
requested
the
count
would
invite
her
to
lengthen
her
stay
at
the
chã¢teau
â€œand
you
know
my
dear
sirâ€
added
blanche
â€œhow
delighted
i
shall
be
with
such
a
companion
for
at
present
i
have
no
friend
to
walk
or
to
read
with
since
mademoiselle
bearn
is
my
mammaâ€™s
friend
onlyâ€
the
count
smiled
at
the
youthful
simplicity
with
which
his
daughter
yielded
to
first
impressions
and
though
he
chose
to
warn
her
of
their
danger
he
silently
applauded
the
benevolence
that
could
thus
readily
expand
in
confidence
to
a
stranger
he
had
observed
emily
with
attention
on
the
preceding
evening
and
was
as
much
pleased
with
her
as
it
was
possible
he
could
be
with
any
person
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
the
mention
made
of
her
by
mons
du
pont
had
also
given
him
a
favourable
impression
of
emily
but
extremely
cautious
as
to
those
whom
he
introduced
to
the
intimacy
of
his
daughter
he
determined
on
hearing
that
the
former
was
no
stranger
at
the
convent
of
st
claire
to
visit
the
abbess
and
if
her
account
corresponded
with
his
wish
to
invite
emily
to
pass
some
time
at
the
chã¢teau
on
this
subject
he
was
influenced
by
a
consideration
of
the
lady
blancheâ€™s
welfare
still
more
than
by
either
a
wish
to
oblige
her
or
to
befriend
the
orphan
emily
for
whom
however
he
felt
considerably
interested
on
the
following
morning
emily
was
too
much
fatigued
to
appear
but
mons
du
pont
was
at
the
breakfast-table
when
the
count
entered
the
room
who
pressed
him
as
his
former
acquaintance
and
the
son
of
a
very
old
friend
to
prolong
his
stay
at
the
chã¢teau
an
invitation
which
du
pont
willingly
accepted
since
it
would
allow
him
to
be
near
emily
and
though
he
was
not
conscious
of
encouraging
a
hope
that
she
would
ever
return
his
affection
he
had
not
fortitude
enough
to
attempt
at
present
to
overcome
it
emily
when
she
was
somewhat
recovered
wandered
with
her
new
friend
over
the
grounds
belonging
to
the
chã¢teau
as
much
delighted
with
the
surrounding
views
as
blanche
in
the
benevolence
of
her
heart
had
wished
from
thence
she
perceived
beyond
the
woods
the
towers
of
the
monastery
and
remarked
that
it
was
to
this
convent
she
designed
to
go
â€œahâ€
said
blanche
with
surprise
â€œi
am
but
just
released
from
a
convent
and
would
you
go
into
one
if
you
could
know
what
pleasure
i
feel
in
wandering
here
at
libertyâ€”and
in
seeing
the
sky
and
the
fields
and
the
woods
all
round
me
i
think
you
would
notâ€
emily
smiling
at
the
warmth
with
which
the
lady
blanche
spoke
observed
that
she
did
not
mean
to
confine
herself
to
a
convent
for
life
â€œno
you
may
not
intend
it
nowâ€
said
blanche
â€œbut
you
do
not
know
to
what
the
nuns
may
persuade
you
to
consent
i
know
how
kind
they
will
appear
and
how
happy
for
i
have
seen
too
much
of
their
artâ€
when
they
returned
to
the
chã¢teau
lady
blanche
conducted
emily
to
her
favourite
turret
and
from
thence
they
rambled
through
the
ancient
chambers
which
blanche
had
visited
before
emily
was
amused
by
observing
the
structure
of
these
apartments
and
the
fashion
of
their
old
but
still
magnificent
furniture
and
by
comparing
them
with
those
of
the
castle
of
udolpho
which
were
yet
more
antique
and
grotesque
she
was
also
interested
by
dorothã©e
the
housekeeper
who
attended
them
whose
appearance
was
almost
as
antique
as
the
objects
around
her
and
who
seemed
no
less
interested
by
emily
on
whom
she
frequently
gazed
with
so
much
deep
attention
as
scarcely
to
hear
what
was
said
to
her
while
emily
looked
from
one
of
the
casements
she
perceived
with
surprise
some
objects
that
were
familiar
to
her
memoryâ€”the
fields
and
woods
with
the
gleaming
brook
which
she
had
passed
with
la
voisin
one
evening
soon
after
the
death
of
monsieur
st
aubert
in
her
way
from
the
monastery
to
her
cottage
and
she
now
knew
this
to
be
the
chã¢teau
which
he
had
then
avoided
and
concerning
which
he
had
dropped
some
remarkable
hints
shocked
by
this
discovery
yet
scarcely
knowing
why
she
mused
for
some
time
in
silence
and
remembered
the
emotion
which
her
father
had
betrayed
on
finding
himself
so
near
this
mansion
and
some
other
circumstances
of
his
conduct
that
now
greatly
interested
her
the
music
too
which
she
had
formerly
heard
and
respecting
which
la
voisin
had
given
such
an
odd
account
occurred
to
her
and
desirous
of
knowing
more
concerning
it
she
asked
dorothã©e
whether
it
returned
at
midnight
as
usual
and
whether
the
musician
had
yet
been
discovered
â€œyes
maâ€™amselleâ€
replied
dorothã©e
â€œthat
music
is
still
heard
but
the
musician
has
never
been
found
out
nor
ever
will
i
believe
though
there
are
some
people
who
can
guessâ€
â€œindeedâ€
said
emily
â€œthen
why
do
they
not
pursue
the
enquiryâ€
â€œah
young
lady
enquiry
enough
has
been
madeâ€”but
who
can
pursue
a
spiritâ€
emily
smiled
and
remembering
how
lately
she
had
suffered
herself
to
be
led
away
by
superstition
determined
now
to
resist
its
contagion
yet
in
spite
of
her
efforts
she
felt
awe
mingle
with
her
curiosity
on
this
subject
and
blanche
who
had
hitherto
listened
in
silence
now
enquired
what
this
music
was
and
how
long
it
had
been
heard
â€œever
since
the
death
of
my
lady
madamâ€
replied
dorothã©e
â€œwhy
the
place
is
not
haunted
surelyâ€
said
blanche
between
jesting
and
seriousness
â€œi
have
heard
that
music
almost
ever
since
my
dear
lady
diedâ€
continued
dorothã©e
â€œand
never
before
then
but
that
is
nothing
to
some
things
i
could
tell
ofâ€
â€œdo
pray
tell
them
thenâ€
said
lady
blanche
now
more
in
earnest
than
in
jest
â€œi
am
much
interested
for
i
have
heard
sister
henriette
and
sister
sophie
in
the
convent
tell
of
such
strange
appearances
which
they
themselves
had
witnessedâ€
â€œyou
never
heard
my
lady
i
suppose
what
made
us
leave
the
chã¢teau
and
go
and
live
in
a
cottageâ€
said
dorothã©e
â€œneverâ€
replied
blanche
with
impatience
â€œnor
the
reason
that
my
lord
the
marquisâ€â€”dorothã©e
checked
herself
hesitated
and
then
endeavoured
to
change
the
topic
but
the
curiosity
of
blanche
was
too
much
awakened
to
suffer
the
subject
thus
easily
to
escape
her
and
she
pressed
the
old
housekeeper
to
proceed
with
her
account
upon
whom
however
no
entreaties
could
prevail
and
it
was
evident
that
she
was
alarmed
for
the
imprudence
into
which
she
had
already
betrayed
herself
â€œi
perceiveâ€
said
emily
smiling
â€œthat
all
old
mansions
are
haunted
i
am
lately
come
from
a
place
of
wonders
but
unluckily
since
i
left
it
i
have
heard
almost
all
of
them
explainedâ€
blanche
was
silent
dorothã©e
looked
grave
and
sighed
and
emily
felt
herself
still
inclined
to
believe
more
of
the
wonderful
than
she
chose
to
acknowledge
just
then
she
remembered
the
spectacle
she
had
witnessed
in
a
chamber
of
udolpho
and
by
an
odd
kind
of
coincidence
the
alarming
words
that
had
accidentally
met
her
eye
in
the
ms
papers
which
she
had
destroyed
in
obedience
to
the
command
of
her
father
and
she
shuddered
at
the
meaning
they
seemed
to
impart
almost
as
much
as
at
the
horrible
appearance
disclosed
by
the
black
veil
the
lady
blanche
meanwhile
unable
to
prevail
with
dorothã©e
to
explain
the
subject
of
her
late
hints
had
desired
on
reaching
the
door
that
terminated
the
gallery
and
which
she
found
fastened
on
the
preceding
day
to
see
the
suite
of
rooms
beyond
â€œdear
young
ladyâ€
said
the
housekeeper
â€œi
have
told
you
my
reason
for
not
opening
them
i
have
never
seen
them
since
my
dear
lady
died
and
it
would
go
hard
with
me
to
see
them
now
pray
madam
do
not
ask
me
againâ€
â€œcertainly
i
will
notâ€
replied
blanche
â€œif
that
is
really
your
objectionâ€
â€œalas
it
isâ€
said
the
old
woman
â€œwe
all
loved
her
well
and
i
shall
always
grieve
for
her
time
runs
round
it
is
now
many
years
since
she
died
but
i
remember
everything
that
happened
then
as
if
it
was
but
yesterday
many
things
that
have
passed
of
late
years
are
gone
quite
from
my
memory
while
those
so
long
ago
i
can
see
as
if
in
a
glassâ€
she
paused
but
afterwards
as
they
walked
up
the
gallery
added
to
emily
â€œthis
young
lady
sometimes
brings
the
late
marchioness
to
my
mind
i
can
remember
when
she
looked
just
as
blooming
and
very
like
her
when
she
smiles
poor
lady
how
gay
she
was
when
she
first
came
to
the
chã¢teauâ€
â€œand
was
she
not
gay
afterwardsâ€
said
blanche
dorothã©e
shook
her
head
and
emily
observed
her
with
eyes
strongly
expressive
of
the
interest
she
now
felt
â€œlet
us
sit
down
in
this
windowâ€
said
the
lady
blanche
on
reaching
the
opposite
end
of
the
gallery
â€œand
pray
dorothã©e
if
it
is
not
painful
to
you
tell
us
something
more
about
the
marchioness
i
should
like
to
look
into
the
glass
you
spoke
of
just
now
and
see
a
few
of
the
circumstances
which
you
say
often
pass
over
itâ€
â€œno
my
ladyâ€
replied
dorothã©e
â€œif
you
knew
as
much
as
i
do
you
would
not
for
you
would
find
there
a
dismal
train
of
them
i
often
wish
i
could
shut
them
out
but
they
will
rise
to
my
mind
i
see
my
dear
lady
on
her
death-bedâ€”her
very
lookâ€”and
remember
all
she
saidâ€”it
was
a
terrible
sceneâ€
â€œwhy
was
it
so
terribleâ€
said
emily
with
emotion
â€œah
dear
young
lady
is
not
death
always
terribleâ€
replied
dorothã©e
to
some
further
enquiries
of
blanche
dorothã©e
was
silent
and
emily
observing
the
tears
in
her
eyes
forbore
to
urge
the
subject
and
endeavoured
to
withdraw
the
attention
of
her
young
friend
to
some
object
in
the
gardens
where
the
count
with
the
countess
and
monsieur
du
pont
appearing
they
went
down
to
join
them
when
he
perceived
emily
he
advanced
to
meet
her
and
presented
her
to
the
countess
in
a
manner
so
benign
that
it
recalled
most
powerfully
to
her
mind
the
idea
of
her
late
father
and
she
felt
more
gratitude
to
him
than
embarrassment
towards
the
countess
who
however
received
her
with
one
of
those
fascinating
smiles
which
her
caprice
sometimes
allowed
her
to
assume
and
which
was
now
the
result
of
a
conversation
the
count
had
held
with
her
concerning
emily
whatever
this
might
be
or
whatever
had
passed
in
his
conversation
with
the
lady
abbess
whom
he
had
just
visited
esteem
and
kindness
were
strongly
apparent
in
his
manner
when
he
addressed
emily
who
experienced
that
sweet
emotion
which
arises
from
the
consciousness
of
possessing
the
approbation
of
the
good
for
to
the
countâ€™s
worth
she
had
been
inclined
to
yield
her
confidence
almost
from
the
first
moment
in
which
she
had
seen
him
before
she
could
finish
her
acknowledgments
for
the
hospitality
she
had
received
and
mention
of
her
design
of
going
immediately
to
the
convent
she
was
interrupted
by
an
invitation
to
lengthen
her
stay
at
the
chã¢teau
which
was
pressed
by
the
count
and
the
countess
with
an
appearance
of
such
friendly
sincerity
that
though
she
much
wished
to
see
her
old
friends
at
the
monastery
and
to
sigh
once
more
over
her
fatherâ€™s
grave
she
consented
to
remain
a
few
days
at
the
chã¢teau
to
the
abbess
however
she
immediately
wrote
mentioning
her
arrival
in
languedoc
and
her
wish
to
be
received
into
the
convent
as
a
boarder
she
also
sent
letters
to
monsieur
quesnel
and
to
valancourt
whom
she
merely
informed
of
her
arrival
in
france
and
as
she
knew
not
where
the
latter
might
be
stationed
she
directed
her
letter
to
his
brotherâ€™s
seat
in
gascony
in
the
evening
lady
blanche
and
mons
du
pont
walked
with
emily
to
the
cottage
of
la
voisin
which
she
had
now
a
melancholy
pleasure
in
approaching
for
time
had
softened
her
grief
for
the
loss
of
st
aubert
though
it
could
not
annihilate
it
and
she
felt
a
soothing
sadness
in
indulging
the
recollections
which
this
scene
recalled
la
voisin
was
still
living
and
seemed
to
enjoy
as
much
as
formerly
the
tranquil
evening
of
a
blameless
life
he
was
sitting
at
the
door
of
his
cottage
watching
some
of
his
grandchildren
playing
on
the
grass
before
him
and
now
and
then
with
a
laugh
or
a
commendation
encouraging
their
sports
he
immediately
recollected
emily
whom
he
was
much
pleased
to
see
and
she
was
as
rejoiced
to
hear
that
he
had
not
lost
one
of
his
family
since
her
departure
â€œyes
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
the
old
man
â€œwe
all
live
merrily
together
still
thank
god
and
i
believe
there
is
not
a
happier
family
to
be
found
in
languedoc
than
oursâ€
emily
did
not
trust
herself
in
the
chamber
where
st
aubert
died
and
after
half
an
hourâ€™s
conversation
with
la
voisin
and
his
family
she
left
the
cottage
during
these
the
first
days
of
her
stay
at
chã¢teau-le-blanc
she
was
often
affected
by
observing
the
deep
but
silent
melancholy
which
at
times
stole
over
du
pont
and
emily
pitying
the
self-delusion
which
disarmed
him
of
the
will
to
depart
determined
to
withdraw
herself
as
soon
as
the
respect
she
owed
the
count
and
countess
de
villefort
would
permit
the
dejection
of
his
friend
soon
alarmed
the
anxiety
of
the
count
to
whom
du
pont
at
length
confided
the
secret
of
his
hopeless
affection
which
however
the
former
could
only
commiserate
though
he
secretly
determined
to
befriend
his
suit
if
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
should
ever
occur
considering
the
dangerous
situation
of
du
pont
he
but
feebly
opposed
his
intention
of
leaving
chã¢teau-le-blanc
on
the
following
day
but
drew
from
him
a
promise
of
a
longer
visit
when
he
could
return
with
safety
to
his
peace
emily
herself
though
she
could
not
encourage
his
affection
esteemed
him
both
for
the
many
virtues
he
possessed
and
for
the
services
she
had
received
from
him
and
it
was
not
without
tender
emotions
of
gratitude
and
pity
that
she
now
saw
him
depart
for
his
family
seat
in
gascony
while
he
took
leave
of
her
with
a
countenance
so
expressive
of
love
and
grief
as
to
interest
the
count
more
warmly
in
his
cause
than
before
in
a
few
days
emily
also
left
the
chã¢teau
but
not
before
the
count
and
countess
had
received
her
promise
to
repeat
her
visit
very
soon
and
she
was
welcomed
by
the
abbess
with
the
same
maternal
kindness
she
had
formerly
experienced
and
by
the
nuns
with
much
expression
of
regard
the
well-known
scenes
of
the
convent
occasioned
her
many
melancholy
recollections
but
with
these
were
mingled
others
that
inspired
gratitude
for
having
escaped
the
various
dangers
that
had
pursued
her
since
she
quitted
it
and
for
the
good
which
she
yet
possessed
and
though
she
once
more
wept
over
her
fatherâ€™s
grave
with
tears
of
tender
affection
her
grief
was
softened
from
its
former
acuteness
some
time
after
her
return
to
the
monastery
she
received
a
letter
from
her
uncle
mons
quesnel
in
answer
to
information
that
she
had
arrived
in
france
and
to
her
enquiries
concerning
such
of
her
affairs
as
he
had
undertaken
to
conduct
during
her
absence
especially
as
to
the
period
for
which
la
vallã©e
had
been
let
whither
it
was
her
wish
to
return
if
it
should
appear
that
her
income
would
permit
her
to
do
so
the
reply
of
mons
quesnel
was
cold
and
formal
as
she
expected
expressing
neither
concern
for
the
evils
she
suffered
nor
pleasure
that
she
was
now
removed
from
them
nor
did
he
allow
the
opportunity
to
pass
of
reproving
her
for
her
rejection
of
count
morano
whom
he
affected
still
to
believe
a
man
of
honour
and
fortune
nor
of
vehemently
declaiming
against
montoni
to
whom
he
had
always
till
now
felt
himself
to
be
inferior
on
emilyâ€™s
pecuniary
concerns
he
was
not
very
explicit
he
informed
her
however
that
the
term
for
which
la
vallã©e
had
been
engaged
was
nearly
expired
but
without
inviting
her
to
his
own
house
added
that
her
circumstances
would
by
no
means
allow
her
to
reside
there
and
earnestly
advised
her
to
remain
for
the
present
in
the
convent
of
st
claire
to
her
enquiries
respecting
poor
old
theresa
her
late
fatherâ€™s
servant
he
gave
no
answer
in
the
postscript
to
his
letter
monsieur
quesnel
mentioned
m
motteville
in
whose
hands
the
late
st
aubert
had
placed
the
chief
of
his
personal
property
as
being
likely
to
arrange
his
affairs
nearly
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
creditors
and
that
emily
would
recover
much
more
of
her
fortune
than
she
had
formerly
reason
to
expect
the
letter
also
inclosed
to
emily
an
order
upon
a
merchant
at
narbonne
for
a
small
sum
of
money
the
tranquillity
of
the
monastery
and
the
liberty
she
was
suffered
to
enjoy
in
wandering
among
the
woods
and
shores
of
this
delightful
province
gradually
restored
her
spirits
to
their
natural
tone
except
that
anxiety
would
sometimes
intrude
concerning
valancourt
as
the
time
approached
when
it
was
possible
that
she
might
receive
an
answer
to
her
letter
as
when
a
wave

from
a
cloud
impends
and
swellâ€™d
with
tempests

popeâ€™s
homer
the
lady
blanche
meanwhile
who
was
left
much
alone
became
impatient
for
the
company
of
her
new
friend
whom
she
wished
to
observe
sharing
in
the
delight
she
received
from
the
beautiful
scenery
around
she
had
now
no
person
to
whom
she
could
express
her
admiration
and
communicate
her
pleasures
no
eye
that
sparkled
to
her
smile
or
countenance
that
reflected
her
happiness
and
she
became
spiritless
and
pensive
the
count
observing
her
dissatisfaction
readily
yielded
to
her
entreaties
and
reminded
emily
of
her
promised
visit
but
the
silence
of
valancourt
which
was
now
prolonged
far
beyond
the
period
when
a
letter
might
have
arrived
from
estuviã¨re
oppressed
emily
with
severe
anxiety
and
rendering
her
averse
to
society
she
would
willingly
have
deferred
her
acceptance
of
this
invitation
till
her
spirits
should
be
relieved
the
count
and
his
family
however
pressed
to
see
her
and
as
the
circumstances
that
prompted
her
wish
for
solitude
could
not
be
explained
there
was
an
appearance
of
caprice
in
her
refusal
which
she
could
not
persevere
in
without
offending
the
friends
whose
esteem
she
valued
at
length
therefore
she
returned
upon
a
second
visit
to
chã¢teau-le-blanc
here
the
friendly
manner
of
count
de
villefort
encouraged
emily
to
mention
to
him
her
situation
respecting
the
estates
of
her
late
aunt
and
to
consult
him
on
the
means
of
recovering
them
he
had
little
doubt
that
the
law
would
decide
in
her
favour
and
advising
her
to
apply
to
it
offered
first
to
write
to
an
advocate
at
avignon
on
whose
opinion
he
thought
he
could
rely
his
kindness
was
gratefully
accepted
by
emily
who
soothed
by
the
courtesy
she
daily
experienced
would
have
been
once
more
happy
could
she
have
been
assured
of
valancourtâ€™s
welfare
and
unaltered
affection
she
had
now
been
above
a
week
at
the
chã¢teau
without
receiving
intelligence
of
him
and
though
she
knew
that
if
he
was
absent
from
his
brotherâ€™s
residence
it
was
scarcely
probable
her
letter
had
yet
reached
him
she
could
not
forbear
to
admit
doubts
and
fears
that
destroyed
her
peace
again
she
would
consider
of
all
that
might
have
happened
in
the
long
period
since
her
first
seclusion
at
udolpho
and
her
mind
was
sometimes
so
overwhelmed
with
an
apprehension
that
valancourt
was
no
more
or
that
he
lived
no
longer
for
her
that
the
company
even
of
blanche
became
intolerably
oppressive
and
she
would
sit
alone
in
her
apartment
for
hours
together
when
the
engagements
of
the
family
allowed
her
to
do
so
without
incivility
in
one
of
these
solitary
hours
she
unlocked
a
little
box
which
contained
some
letters
of
valancourt
with
some
drawings
she
had
sketched
during
her
stay
in
tuscany
the
latter
of
which
were
no
longer
interesting
to
her
but
in
the
letters
she
now
with
melancholy
indulgence
meant
to
retrace
the
tenderness
that
had
so
often
soothed
her
and
rendered
her
for
a
moment
insensible
of
the
distance
which
separated
her
from
the
writer
but
their
effect
was
now
changed
the
affection
they
expressed
appealed
so
forcibly
to
her
heart
when
she
considered
that
it
had
perhaps
yielded
to
the
powers
of
time
and
absence
and
even
the
view
of
the
hand-writing
recalled
so
many
painful
recollections
that
she
found
herself
unable
to
go
through
the
first
she
had
opened
and
sat
musing
with
her
cheek
resting
on
her
arm
and
tears
stealing
from
her
eyes
when
old
dorothã©e
entered
the
room
to
inform
her
that
dinner
would
be
ready
an
hour
before
the
usual
time
emily
started
on
perceiving
her
and
hastily
put
up
the
papers
but
not
before
dorothã©e
had
observed
both
her
agitation
and
her
tears
â€œah
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
she
â€œyou
who
are
so
youngâ€”have
you
reason
for
sorrowâ€
emily
tried
to
smile
but
was
unable
to
speak
â€œalas
dear
young
lady
when
you
come
to
my
age
you
will
not
weep
at
trifles
and
surely
you
have
nothing
serious
to
grieve
youâ€
â€œno
dorothã©e
nothing
of
any
consequenceâ€
replied
emily
dorothã©e
now
stooping
to
pick
up
something
that
had
dropped
from
among
the
papers
suddenly
exclaimed
â€œholy
mary
what
is
it
i
seeâ€
and
then
trembling
sat
down
in
a
chair
that
stood
by
the
table
â€œwhat
is
it
you
do
seeâ€
said
emily
alarmed
by
her
manner
and
looking
round
the
room
â€œit
is
herselfâ€
said
dorothã©e
â€œher
very
self
just
as
she
looked
a
little
before
she
diedâ€
emily
still
more
alarmed
began
now
to
fear
that
dorothã©e
was
seized
with
sudden
frenzy
but
entreated
her
to
explain
herself
â€œthat
pictureâ€
said
she
â€œwhere
did
you
find
it
lady
it
is
my
blessed
mistress
herselfâ€
she
laid
on
the
table
the
miniature
which
emily
had
long
ago
found
among
the
papers
her
father
had
enjoined
her
to
destroy
and
over
which
she
had
once
seen
him
shed
such
tender
and
affecting
tears
and
recollecting
all
the
various
circumstances
of
his
conduct
that
had
long
perplexed
her
her
emotions
increased
to
an
excess
which
deprived
her
of
all
power
to
ask
the
questions
she
trembled
to
have
answered
and
she
could
only
enquire
whether
dorothã©e
was
certain
the
picture
resembled
the
late
marchioness
â€œo
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
she
â€œhow
came
it
to
strike
me
so
the
instant
i
saw
it
if
it
was
not
my
ladyâ€™s
likeness
ahâ€
added
she
taking
up
the
miniature
â€œthese
are
her
own
blue
eyesâ€”looking
so
sweet
and
so
mild
and
there
is
her
very
look
such
as
i
have
often
seen
it
when
she
had
sat
thinking
for
a
long
while
and
then
the
tears
would
often
steal
down
her
cheeksâ€”but
she
never
would
complain
it
was
that
look
so
meek
as
it
were
and
resigned
that
used
to
break
my
heart
and
make
me
love
her
soâ€
â€œdorothã©eâ€
said
emily
solemnly
â€œi
am
interested
in
the
cause
of
that
grief
more
so
perhaps
than
you
may
imagine
and
i
entreat
that
you
will
no
longer
refuse
to
indulge
my
curiosityâ€”it
is
not
a
common
oneâ€
as
emily
said
this
she
remembered
the
papers
with
which
the
picture
had
been
found
and
had
scarcely
a
doubt
that
they
had
concerned
the
marchioness
de
villeroi
but
with
this
supposition
came
a
scruple
whether
she
ought
to
enquire
further
on
a
subject
which
might
prove
to
be
the
same
that
her
father
had
so
carefully
endeavoured
to
conceal
her
curiosity
concerning
the
marchioness
powerful
as
it
was
it
is
probable
she
would
now
have
resisted
as
she
had
formerly
done
on
unwarily
observing
the
few
terrible
words
in
the
papers
which
had
never
since
been
erased
from
her
memory
had
she
been
certain
that
the
history
of
that
lady
was
the
subject
of
those
papers
or
that
such
simple
particulars
only
as
it
was
probable
dorothã©e
could
relate
were
included
in
her
fatherâ€™s
command
what
was
known
to
her
could
be
no
secret
to
many
other
persons
and
since
it
appeared
very
unlikely
that
st
aubert
should
attempt
to
conceal
what
emily
might
learn
by
ordinary
means
she
at
length
concluded
that
if
the
papers
had
related
to
the
story
of
the
marchioness
it
was
not
those
circumstances
of
it
which
dorothã©e
could
disclose
that
he
had
thought
sufficiently
important
to
wish
to
have
concealed
she
therefore
no
longer
hesitated
to
make
the
enquiries
that
might
lead
to
the
gratification
of
her
curiosity
â€œah
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
dorothã©e
â€œit
is
a
sad
story
and
cannot
be
told
now
but
what
am
i
saying
i
never
will
tell
it
many
years
have
passed
since
it
happened
and
i
never
loved
to
talk
of
the
marchioness
to
anybody
but
my
husband
he
lived
in
the
family
at
that
time
as
well
as
myself
and
he
knew
many
particulars
from
me
which
nobody
else
did
for
i
was
about
the
person
of
my
lady
in
her
last
illness
and
saw
and
heard
as
much
or
more
than
my
lord
himself
sweet
saint
how
patient
she
was
when
she
died
i
thought
i
could
have
died
with
herâ€
â€œdorothã©eâ€
said
emily
interrupting
her
â€œwhat
you
shall
tell
you
may
depend
upon
it
shall
never
be
disclosed
by
me
i
have
i
repeat
it
particular
reasons
for
wishing
to
be
informed
on
this
subject
and
am
willing
to
bind
myself
in
the
most
solemn
manner
never
to
mention
what
you
shall
wish
me
to
concealâ€
dorothã©e
seemed
surprised
at
the
earnestness
of
emilyâ€™s
manner
and
after
regarding
her
for
some
moments
in
silence
said
â€œyoung
lady
that
look
of
yours
pleads
for
youâ€”it
is
so
like
my
dear
mistressâ€™s
that
i
can
almost
fancy
i
see
her
before
me
if
you
were
her
daughter
you
could
not
remind
me
of
her
more
but
dinner
will
be
readyâ€”had
you
not
better
go
downâ€
â€œyou
will
first
promise
to
grant
my
requestâ€
said
emily
â€œand
ought
not
you
first
to
tell
me
maâ€™amselle
how
this
picture
fell
into
your
hands
and
the
reasons
you
say
you
have
for
curiosity
about
my
ladyâ€
â€œwhy
no
dorothã©eâ€
replied
emily
recollecting
herself
â€œi
have
also
particular
reasons
for
observing
silence
on
these
subjects
at
least
till
i
know
further
and
remember
i
do
not
promise
ever
to
speak
upon
them
therefore
do
not
let
me
induce
you
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
from
an
expectation
that
i
shall
gratify
yours
what
i
may
judge
proper
to
conceal
does
not
concern
myself
alone
or
i
should
have
less
scruple
in
revealing
it
let
a
confidence
in
my
honour
alone
persuade
you
to
disclose
what
i
requestâ€
â€œwell
ladyâ€
replied
dorothã©e
after
a
long
pause
during
which
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
emily
â€œyou
seem
so
much
interestedâ€”and
this
picture
and
that
face
of
yours
make
me
think
you
have
some
reason
to
be
soâ€”that
i
will
trust
youâ€”and
tell
some
things
that
i
never
told
before
to
anybody
but
my
husband
though
there
are
people
who
have
suspected
as
much
i
will
tell
you
the
particulars
of
my
ladyâ€™s
death
too
and
some
of
my
own
suspicions
but
you
must
first
promise
me
by
all
the
saintsâ€”â€
emily
interrupting
her
solemnly
promised
never
to
reveal
what
should
be
confided
to
her
without
dorothã©eâ€™s
consent
â€œbut
there
is
the
horn
maâ€™amselle
sounding
for
dinnerâ€
said
dorothã©e
â€œi
must
be
goneâ€
â€œwhen
shall
i
see
you
againâ€
enquired
emily
dorothã©e
mused
and
then
replied
â€œwhy
madam
it
may
make
people
curious
if
it
is
known
i
am
so
much
in
your
apartment
and
that
i
should
be
sorry
for
so
i
will
come
when
i
am
least
likely
to
be
observed
i
have
little
leisure
in
the
day
and
i
shall
have
a
good
deal
to
say
so
if
you
please
maâ€™am
i
will
come
when
the
family
are
all
in
bedâ€
â€œthat
will
suit
me
very
wellâ€
replied
emily
â€œremember
then
tonightâ€”â€
â€œaye
that
is
well
rememberedâ€
said
dorothã©e
â€œi
fear
i
cannot
come
tonight
madam
for
there
will
be
the
dance
of
the
vintage
and
it
will
be
late
before
the
servants
go
to
rest
for
when
they
once
set
in
to
dance
they
will
keep
it
up
in
the
cool
of
the
air
till
morning
at
least
it
used
to
be
so
in
my
timeâ€
â€œah
is
it
the
dance
of
the
vintageâ€
said
emily
with
a
deep
sigh
remembering
that
it
was
on
the
evening
of
this
festival
in
the
preceding
year
that
st
aubert
and
herself
had
arrived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
chã¢teau-le-blanc
she
paused
a
moment
overcome
by
the
sudden
recollection
and
then
recovering
herself
addedâ€”â€œbut
this
dance
is
in
the
open
woods
you
therefore
will
not
be
wanted
and
can
easily
come
to
meâ€
dorothã©e
replied
that
she
had
been
accustomed
to
be
present
at
the
dance
of
the
vintage
and
she
did
not
wish
to
be
absent
now
â€œbut
if
i
can
get
away
madam
i
willâ€
said
she
emily
then
hastened
to
the
dining-room
where
the
count
conducted
himself
with
the
courtesy
which
is
inseparable
from
true
dignity
and
of
which
the
countess
frequently
practised
little
though
her
manner
to
emily
was
an
exception
to
her
usual
habit
but
if
she
retained
few
of
the
ornamental
virtues
she
cherished
other
qualities
which
she
seemed
to
consider
invaluable
she
had
dismissed
the
grace
of
modesty
but
then
she
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
manage
the
stare
of
assurance
her
manners
had
little
of
the
tempered
sweetness
which
is
necessary
to
render
the
female
character
interesting
but
she
could
occasionally
throw
into
them
an
affectation
of
spirits
which
seemed
to
triumph
over
every
person
who
approached
her
in
the
country
however
she
generally
affected
an
elegant
languor
that
persuaded
her
almost
to
faint
when
her
favourite
read
to
her
a
story
of
fictitious
sorrow
but
her
countenance
suffered
no
change
when
living
objects
of
distress
solicited
her
charity
and
her
heart
beat
with
no
transport
to
the
thought
of
giving
them
instant
reliefâ€”she
was
a
stranger
to
the
highest
luxury
of
which
perhaps
the
human
mind
can
be
sensible
for
her
benevolence
had
never
yet
called
smiles
upon
the
face
of
misery
in
the
evening
the
count
with
all
his
family
except
the
countess
and
mademoiselle
bearn
went
to
the
woods
to
witness
the
festivity
of
the
peasants
the
scene
was
in
a
glade
where
the
trees
opening
formed
a
circle
round
the
turf
they
highly
overshadowed
between
their
branches
vines
loaded
with
ripe
clusters
were
hung
in
gay
festoons
and
beneath
were
tables
with
fruit
wine
cheese
and
other
rural
fareâ€”and
seats
for
the
count
and
his
family
at
a
little
distance
were
benches
for
the
elder
peasants
few
of
whom
however
could
forbear
to
join
the
jocund
dance
which
began
soon
after
sunset
when
several
of
sixty
tripped
it
with
almost
as
much
glee
and
airy
lightness
as
those
of
sixteen
the
musicians
who
sat
carelessly
on
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
seemed
inspired
by
the
sound
of
their
own
instruments
which
were
chiefly
flutes
and
a
kind
of
long
guitar
behind
stood
a
boy
flourishing
a
tamborine
and
dancing
a
solo
except
that
as
he
sometimes
gaily
tossed
the
instrument
he
tripped
among
the
other
dancers
when
his
antic
gestures
called
forth
a
broader
laugh
and
heightened
the
rustic
spirit
of
the
scene
the
count
was
highly
delighted
with
the
happiness
he
witnessed
to
which
his
bounty
had
largely
contributed
and
the
lady
blanche
joined
the
dance
with
a
young
gentleman
of
her
fatherâ€™s
party
du
pont
requested
emilyâ€™s
hand
but
her
spirits
were
too
much
depressed
to
permit
her
to
engage
in
the
present
festivity
which
called
to
her
remembrance
that
of
the
preceding
year
when
st
aubert
was
living
and
of
the
melancholy
scenes
which
had
immediately
followed
it
overcome
by
these
recollections
she
at
length
left
the
spot
and
walked
slowly
into
the
woods
where
the
softened
music
floating
at
a
distance
soothed
her
melancholy
mind
the
moon
threw
a
mellow
light
among
the
foliage
the
air
was
balmy
and
cool
and
emily
lost
in
thought
strolled
on
without
observing
whither
till
she
perceived
the
sounds
sinking
afar
off
and
an
awful
stillness
round
her
except
that
sometimes
the
nightingale
beguiled
the
silence
with
liquid
notes
that
close
the
eye
of
day
at
length
she
found
herself
near
the
avenue
which
on
the
night
of
her
fatherâ€™s
arrival
michael
had
attempted
to
pass
in
search
of
a
house
which
was
still
nearly
as
wild
and
desolate
as
it
had
then
appeared
for
the
count
had
been
so
much
engaged
in
directing
other
improvements
that
he
had
neglected
to
give
orders
concerning
this
extensive
approach
and
the
road
was
yet
broken
and
the
trees
overloaded
with
their
own
luxuriance
as
she
stood
surveying
it
and
remembering
the
emotions
which
she
had
formerly
suffered
there
she
suddenly
recollected
the
figure
that
had
been
seen
stealing
among
the
trees
and
which
had
returned
no
answer
to
michaelâ€™s
repeated
calls
and
she
experienced
somewhat
of
the
fear
that
had
then
assailed
her
for
it
did
not
appear
improbable
that
these
deep
woods
were
occasionally
the
haunt
of
banditti
she
therefore
turned
back
and
was
hastily
pursuing
her
way
to
the
dancers
when
she
heard
steps
approaching
from
the
avenue
and
being
still
beyond
the
call
of
the
peasants
on
the
green
for
she
could
neither
hear
their
voices
nor
their
music
she
quickened
her
pace
but
the
persons
following
gained
fast
upon
her
and
at
length
distinguishing
the
voice
of
henri
she
walked
leisurely
till
he
came
up
he
expressed
some
surprise
at
meeting
her
so
far
from
the
company
and
on
her
saying
that
the
pleasant
moonlight
had
beguiled
her
to
walk
farther
than
she
intended
an
exclamation
burst
from
the
lips
of
his
companion
and
she
thought
she
heard
valancourt
speak
it
was
indeed
he
and
the
meeting
was
such
as
may
be
imagined
between
persons
so
affectionate
and
so
long
separated
as
they
had
been
in
the
joy
of
these
moments
emily
forgot
all
her
past
sufferings
and
valancourt
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
any
person
but
emily
existed
while
henri
was
a
silent
and
astonished
spectator
of
the
scene
valancourt
asked
a
thousand
questions
concerning
herself
and
montoni
which
there
was
now
no
time
to
answer
but
she
learned
that
her
letter
had
been
forwarded
to
him
at
paris
which
he
had
previously
quitted
and
was
returning
to
gascony
whither
the
letter
also
returned
which
at
length
informed
him
of
emilyâ€™s
arrival
and
on
the
receipt
of
which
he
had
immediately
set
out
for
languedoc
on
reaching
the
monastery
whence
she
had
dated
her
letter
he
found
to
his
extreme
disappointment
that
the
gates
were
already
closed
for
the
night
and
believing
that
he
should
not
see
emily
till
the
morrow
he
was
returning
to
his
little
inn
with
the
intention
of
writing
to
her
when
he
was
overtaken
by
henri
with
whom
he
had
been
intimate
at
paris
and
was
led
to
her
whom
he
was
secretly
lamenting
that
he
should
not
see
till
the
following
day
emily
with
valancourt
and
henri
now
returned
to
the
green
where
the
latter
presented
valancourt
to
the
count
who
she
fancied
received
him
with
less
than
his
usual
benignity
though
it
appeared
that
they
were
not
strangers
to
each
other
he
was
invited
however
to
partake
of
the
diversions
of
the
evening
and
when
he
had
paid
his
respects
to
the
count
and
while
the
dancers
continued
their
festivity
he
seated
himself
by
emily
and
conversed
without
restraint
the
lights
which
were
hung
among
the
trees
under
which
they
sat
allowed
her
a
more
perfect
view
of
the
countenance
she
had
so
frequently
in
absence
endeavoured
to
recollect
and
she
perceived
with
some
regret
that
it
was
not
the
same
as
when
last
she
saw
it
there
was
all
its
wonted
intelligence
and
fire
but
it
had
lost
much
of
the
simplicity
and
somewhat
of
the
open
benevolence
that
used
to
characterise
it
still
however
it
was
an
interesting
countenance
but
emily
thought
she
perceived
at
intervals
anxiety
contract
and
melancholy
fix
the
features
of
valancourt
sometimes
too
he
fell
into
a
momentary
musing
and
then
appeared
anxious
to
dissipate
thought
while
at
others
as
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
emily
a
kind
of
sudden
distraction
seemed
to
cross
his
mind
in
her
he
perceived
the
same
goodness
and
beautiful
simplicity
that
had
charmed
him
on
their
first
acquaintance
the
bloom
of
her
countenance
was
somewhat
faded
but
all
its
sweetness
remained
and
it
was
rendered
more
interesting
than
ever
by
the
faint
expression
of
melancholy
that
sometimes
mingled
with
her
smile
at
his
request
she
related
the
most
important
circumstances
that
had
occurred
to
her
since
she
left
france
and
emotions
of
pity
and
indignation
alternately
prevailed
in
his
mind
when
he
heard
how
much
she
had
suffered
from
the
villany
of
montoni
more
than
once
when
she
was
speaking
of
his
conduct
of
which
the
guilt
was
rather
softened
than
exaggerated
by
her
representation
he
started
from
his
seat
and
walked
away
apparently
overcome
as
much
by
self-accusation
as
by
resentment
her
sufferings
alone
were
mentioned
in
the
few
words
which
he
could
address
to
her
and
he
listened
not
to
the
account
which
she
was
careful
to
give
as
distinctly
as
possible
of
the
present
loss
of
madame
montoniâ€™s
estates
and
of
the
little
reason
there
was
to
expect
their
restoration
at
length
valancourt
remained
lost
in
thought
and
then
some
secret
cause
seemed
to
overcome
him
with
anguish
again
he
abruptly
left
her
when
he
returned
she
perceived
that
he
had
been
weeping
and
tenderly
begged
that
he
would
compose
himself
â€œmy
sufferings
are
all
passed
nowâ€
said
she
â€œfor
i
have
escaped
from
the
tyranny
of
montoni
and
i
see
you
wellâ€”let
me
also
see
you
happyâ€
valancourt
was
more
agitated
than
before
â€œi
am
unworthy
of
you
emilyâ€
said
he
â€œi
am
unworthy
of
youâ€â€”words
by
his
manner
of
uttering
which
emily
was
then
more
shocked
than
by
their
import
she
fixed
on
him
a
mournful
and
enquiring
eye
â€œdo
not
look
thus
on
meâ€
said
he
turning
away
and
pressing
her
hand
â€œi
cannot
bear
those
looksâ€
â€œi
would
askâ€
said
emily
in
a
gentle
but
agitated
voice
â€œthe
meaning
of
your
words
but
i
perceive
that
the
question
would
distress
you
now
let
us
talk
on
other
subjects
tomorrow
perhaps
you
may
be
more
composed
observe
those
moonlight
woods
and
the
towers
which
appear
obscurely
in
the
perspective
you
used
to
be
a
great
admirer
of
landscape
and
i
have
heard
you
say
that
the
faculty
of
deriving
consolation
under
misfortune
from
the
sublime
prospects
which
neither
oppression
nor
poverty
withhold
from
us
was
the
peculiar
blessing
of
the
innocentâ€
valancourt
was
deeply
affected
â€œyesâ€
replied
he
â€œi
had
once
a
taste
for
innocent
and
elegant
delightsâ€”i
had
once
an
uncorrupted
heartâ€
then
checking
himself
he
added
â€œdo
you
remember
our
journey
together
in
the
pyreneesâ€
â€œcan
i
forget
itâ€
said
emilyâ€”â€œwould
that
i
couldâ€
he
repliedâ€”â€œthat
was
the
happiest
period
of
my
life
i
then
loved
with
enthusiasm
whatever
was
truly
great
or
goodâ€
it
was
some
time
before
emily
could
repress
her
tears
and
try
to
command
her
emotions
â€œif
you
wish
to
forget
that
journeyâ€
said
she
â€œit
must
certainly
be
my
wish
to
forget
it
alsoâ€
she
paused
and
then
added
â€œyou
make
me
very
uneasy
but
this
is
not
the
time
for
further
enquiryâ€”yet
how
can
i
bear
to
believe
even
for
a
moment
that
you
are
less
worthy
of
my
esteem
than
formerly
i
have
still
sufficient
confidence
in
your
candour
to
believe
that
when
i
shall
ask
for
an
explanation
you
will
give
it
meâ€â€”â€œyesâ€
said
valancourt
â€œyes
emily
i
have
not
yet
lost
my
candour
if
i
had
i
could
better
have
disguised
my
emotions
on
learning
what
were
your
sufferingsâ€”your
virtues
while
iâ€”iâ€”but
i
will
say
no
more
i
did
not
mean
to
have
said
even
so
muchâ€”i
have
been
surprised
into
the
self-accusation
tell
me
emily
that
you
will
not
forget
that
journeyâ€”will
not
wish
to
forget
it
and
i
will
be
calm
i
would
not
lose
the
remembrance
of
it
for
the
whole
earthâ€
â€œhow
contradictory
is
thisâ€
said
emilyâ€”â€œbut
we
may
be
overheard
my
recollection
of
it
shall
depend
upon
yours
i
will
endeavour
to
forget
or
to
recollect
it
as
you
may
do
let
us
join
the
countâ€â€”â€œtell
me
firstâ€
said
valancourt
â€œthat
you
forgive
the
uneasiness
i
have
occasioned
you
this
evening
and
that
you
will
still
love
meâ€â€”â€œi
sincerely
forgive
youâ€
replied
emily
â€œyou
best
know
whether
i
shall
continue
to
love
you
for
you
know
whether
you
deserve
my
esteem
at
present
i
will
believe
that
you
do
it
is
unnecessary
to
sayâ€
added
she
observing
his
dejection
â€œhow
much
pain
it
would
give
me
to
believe
otherwiseâ€”the
young
lady
who
approaches
is
the
countâ€™s
daughterâ€
valancourt
and
emily
now
joined
the
lady
blanche
and
the
party
soon
after
sat
down
with
the
count
his
son
and
the
chevalier
du
pont
at
a
banquet
spread
under
a
gay
awning
beneath
the
trees
at
the
table
also
were
seated
several
of
the
most
venerable
of
the
countâ€™s
tenants
and
it
was
a
festive
repast
to
all
but
valancourt
and
emily
when
the
count
retired
to
the
chã¢teau
he
did
not
invite
valancourt
to
accompany
him
who
therefore
took
leave
of
emily
and
retired
to
his
solitary
inn
for
the
night
meanwhile
she
soon
withdrew
to
her
own
apartment
where
she
mused
with
deep
anxiety
and
concern
on
his
behaviour
and
on
the
countâ€™s
reception
of
him
her
attention
was
thus
so
wholly
engaged
that
she
forgot
dorothã©e
and
her
appointment
till
morning
was
far
advanced
when
knowing
that
the
good
old
woman
would
not
come
she
retired
for
a
few
hours
to
repose
on
the
following
day
when
the
count
had
accidentally
joined
emily
in
one
of
the
walks
they
talked
of
the
festival
of
the
preceding
evening
and
this
led
him
to
a
mention
of
valancourt
â€œthat
is
a
young
man
of
talentsâ€
said
he
â€œyou
were
formerly
acquainted
with
him
i
perceiveâ€
emily
said
that
she
was
â€œhe
was
introduced
to
me
at
parisâ€
said
the
count
â€œand
i
was
much
pleased
with
him
on
our
first
acquaintanceâ€
he
paused
and
emily
trembled
between
the
desire
of
hearing
more
and
the
fear
of
showing
the
count
that
she
felt
an
interest
on
the
subject
â€œmay
i
askâ€
said
he
at
length
â€œhow
long
you
have
known
monsieur
valancourtâ€â€”â€œwill
you
allow
me
to
ask
your
reason
for
the
question
sirâ€
said
she
â€œand
i
will
answer
it
immediatelyâ€â€”â€œcertainlyâ€
said
the
count
â€œthat
is
but
just
i
will
tell
you
my
reason
i
cannot
but
perceive
that
monsieur
valancourt
admires
you
in
that
however
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
every
person
who
sees
you
must
do
the
same
i
am
above
using
common-place
compliments
i
speak
with
sincerity
what
i
fear
is
that
he
is
a
favoured
admirerâ€â€”â€œwhy
do
you
fear
it
sirâ€
said
emily
endeavouring
to
conceal
her
emotionâ€”â€œbecauseâ€
replied
the
count
â€œi
think
him
not
worthy
of
your
favourâ€
emily
greatly
agitated
entreated
further
explanation
â€œi
will
give
itâ€
said
he
â€œif
you
will
believe
that
nothing
but
a
strong
interest
in
your
welfare
could
induce
me
to
hazard
that
assertionâ€â€”â€œi
must
believe
so
sirâ€
replied
emily
â€œbut
let
us
rest
under
these
treesâ€
said
the
count
observing
the
paleness
of
her
countenance
â€œhere
is
a
seatâ€”you
are
fatiguedâ€
they
sat
down
and
the
count
proceeded
â€œmany
young
ladies
circumstanced
as
you
are
would
think
my
conduct
on
this
occasion
and
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
impertinent
instead
of
friendly
from
what
i
have
observed
of
your
temper
and
understanding
i
do
not
fear
such
a
return
from
you
our
acquaintance
has
been
short
but
long
enough
to
make
me
esteem
you
and
feel
a
lively
interest
in
your
happiness
you
deserve
to
be
very
happy
and
i
trust
that
you
will
be
soâ€
emily
sighed
softly
and
bowed
her
thanks
the
count
paused
again
â€œi
am
unpleasantly
circumstancedâ€
said
he
â€œbut
an
opportunity
of
rendering
you
important
service
shall
overcome
inferior
considerations
will
you
inform
me
of
the
manner
of
your
first
acquaintance
with
the
chevalier
valancourt
if
the
subject
is
not
too
painfulâ€
emily
briefly
related
the
accident
of
their
meeting
in
the
presence
of
her
father
and
then
so
earnestly
entreated
the
count
not
to
hesitate
in
declaring
what
he
knew
that
he
perceived
the
violent
emotion
against
which
she
was
contending
and
regarding
her
with
a
look
of
tender
compassion
considered
how
he
might
communicate
his
information
with
least
pain
to
his
anxious
auditor
â€œthe
chevalier
and
my
sonâ€
said
he
â€œwere
introduced
to
each
other
at
the
table
of
a
brother
officer
at
whose
house
i
also
met
him
and
invited
him
to
my
own
whenever
he
should
be
disengaged
i
did
not
then
know
that
he
had
formed
an
acquaintance
with
a
set
of
men
a
disgrace
to
their
species
who
live
by
plunder
and
pass
their
lives
in
continual
debauchery
i
knew
several
of
the
chevalierâ€™s
family
resident
at
paris
and
considered
them
as
sufficient
pledges
for
his
introduction
to
my
own
but
you
are
ill
i
will
leave
the
subjectâ€â€”â€œno
sirâ€
said
emily
â€œi
beg
you
will
proceed
i
am
only
distressedâ€â€”â€œonlyâ€
said
the
count
with
emphasis
â€œhowever
i
will
proceed
i
soon
learned
that
these
his
associates
had
drawn
him
into
a
course
of
dissipation
from
which
he
appeared
to
have
neither
the
power
nor
the
inclination
to
extricate
himself
he
lost
large
sums
at
the
gaming-table
he
became
infatuated
with
play
and
was
ruined
i
spoke
tenderly
of
this
to
his
friends
who
assured
me
that
they
had
remonstrated
with
him
till
they
were
weary
i
afterwards
learned
that
in
consideration
of
his
talents
for
play
which
were
generally
successful
when
unopposed
by
the
tricks
of
villanyâ€”that
in
consideration
of
these
the
party
had
initiated
him
into
the
secrets
of
their
trade
and
allotted
him
a
share
of
their
profitsâ€
â€œimpossibleâ€
said
emily
suddenly
â€œbutâ€”pardon
me
sir
i
scarcely
know
what
i
say
allow
for
the
distress
of
my
mind
i
must
indeed
i
must
believe
that
you
have
not
been
truly
informed
the
chevalier
had
doubtless
enemies
who
misrepresented
himâ€â€”â€œi
should
be
most
happy
to
believe
soâ€
replied
the
count
â€œbut
i
cannot
nothing
short
of
conviction
and
a
regard
for
your
happiness
could
have
urged
me
to
repeat
these
unpleasant
reportsâ€
emily
was
silent
she
recollected
valancourtâ€™s
sayings
on
the
preceding
evening
which
discovered
the
pangs
of
self-reproach
and
seemed
to
confirm
all
that
the
count
had
related
yet
she
had
not
fortitude
enough
to
dare
conviction
her
heart
was
overwhelmed
with
anguish
at
the
mere
suspicion
of
his
guilt
and
she
could
not
endure
a
belief
of
it
after
a
silence
the
count
said
â€œi
perceive
and
can
allow
for
your
want
of
conviction
it
is
necessary
i
should
give
some
proof
of
what
i
have
asserted
but
this
i
cannot
do
without
subjecting
one
who
is
very
dear
to
me
to
dangerâ€â€”â€œwhat
is
the
danger
you
apprehend
sirâ€
said
emily
â€œif
i
can
prevent
it
you
may
safely
confide
in
my
honourâ€â€”â€œon
your
honour
i
am
certain
i
can
relyâ€
said
the
count
â€œbut
can
i
trust
your
fortitude
do
you
think
you
can
resist
the
solicitation
of
a
favoured
admirer
when
he
pleads
in
affliction
for
the
name
of
one
who
has
robbed
him
of
a
blessingâ€â€”â€œi
shall
not
be
exposed
to
such
a
temptation
sirâ€
said
emily
with
modest
pride
â€œfor
i
cannot
favour
one
whom
i
must
no
longer
esteem
i
however
readily
give
my
wordâ€
tears
in
the
mean
time
contradicted
her
first
assertion
and
she
felt
that
time
and
effort
only
could
eradicate
an
affection
which
had
been
formed
on
virtuous
esteem
and
cherished
by
habit
and
difficulty
â€œi
will
trust
you
thenâ€
said
the
count
â€œfor
conviction
is
necessary
to
your
peace
and
cannot
i
perceive
be
obtained
without
this
confidence
my
son
has
too
often
been
an
eye-witness
of
the
chevalierâ€™s
ill
conduct
he
was
very
near
being
drawn
in
by
it
he
was
indeed
drawn
in
to
the
commission
of
many
follies
but
i
rescued
him
from
guilt
and
destruction
judge
then
mademoiselle
st
aubert
whether
a
father
who
had
nearly
lost
his
only
son
by
the
example
of
the
chevalier
has
not
from
conviction
reason
to
warn
those
whom
he
esteems
against
trusting
their
happiness
in
such
hands
i
have
myself
seen
the
chevalier
engaged
in
deep
play
with
men
whom
i
almost
shuddered
to
look
upon
if
you
still
doubt
i
will
refer
you
to
my
sonâ€
â€œi
must
not
doubt
what
you
have
yourself
witnessedâ€
replied
emily
sinking
with
grief
â€œor
what
you
assert
but
the
chevalier
has
perhaps
been
drawn
only
into
a
transient
folly
which
he
may
never
repeat
if
you
had
known
the
justness
of
his
former
principles
you
would
allow
for
my
present
incredulityâ€
â€œalasâ€
observed
the
count
â€œit
is
difficult
to
believe
that
which
will
make
us
wretched
but
i
will
not
sooth
you
by
flattering
and
false
hopes
we
all
know
how
fascinating
the
vice
of
gaming
is
and
how
difficult
it
is
also
to
conquer
habits
the
chevalier
might
perhaps
reform
for
a
while
but
he
would
soon
relapse
into
dissipationâ€”for
i
fear
not
only
the
bonds
of
habit
would
be
powerful
but
that
his
morals
are
corrupted
andâ€”why
should
i
conceal
from
you
that
play
is
not
his
only
vice
he
appears
to
have
a
taste
for
every
vicious
pleasureâ€
the
count
hesitated
and
paused
while
emily
endeavoured
to
support
herself
as
with
increasing
perturbation
she
expected
what
he
might
further
say
a
long
pause
of
silence
ensued
during
which
he
was
visibly
agitated
at
length
he
said
â€œit
would
be
a
cruel
delicacy
that
could
prevail
with
me
to
be
silentâ€”and
i
will
inform
you
that
the
chevalierâ€™s
extravagance
has
brought
him
twice
into
the
prisons
of
paris
from
whence
he
was
last
extricated
as
i
was
told
upon
authority
which
i
cannot
doubt
by
a
well-known
parisian
countess
with
whom
he
continued
to
reside
when
i
left
parisâ€
he
paused
again
and
looking
at
emily
perceived
her
countenance
change
and
that
she
was
falling
from
the
seat
he
caught
her
but
she
had
fainted
and
he
called
loudly
for
assistance
they
were
however
beyond
the
hearing
of
his
servants
at
the
chã¢teau
and
he
feared
to
leave
her
while
he
went
thither
for
assistance
yet
knew
not
how
otherwise
to
obtain
it
till
a
fountain
at
no
great
distance
caught
his
eye
and
he
endeavoured
to
support
emily
against
the
tree
under
which
she
had
been
sitting
while
he
went
thither
for
water
but
again
he
was
perplexed
for
he
had
nothing
near
him
in
which
water
could
be
brought
but
while
with
increased
anxiety
he
watched
her
he
thought
he
perceived
in
her
countenance
symptoms
of
returning
life
it
was
long
however
before
she
revived
and
then
she
found
herself
supportedâ€”not
by
the
count
but
by
valancourt
who
was
observing
her
with
looks
of
earnest
apprehension
and
who
now
spoke
to
her
in
a
tone
tremulous
with
his
anxiety
at
the
sound
of
his
well-known
voice
she
raised
her
eyes
but
presently
closed
them
and
a
faintness
again
came
over
her
the
count
with
a
look
somewhat
stern
waved
him
to
withdraw
but
he
only
sighed
heavily
and
called
on
the
name
of
emily
as
he
again
held
the
water
that
had
been
brought
to
her
lips
on
the
countâ€™s
repeating
his
action
and
accompanying
it
with
words
valancourt
answered
him
with
a
look
of
deep
resentment
and
refused
to
leave
the
place
till
she
should
revive
or
to
resign
her
for
a
moment
to
the
care
of
any
person
in
the
next
instant
his
conscience
seemed
to
inform
him
of
what
had
been
the
subject
of
the
countâ€™s
conversation
with
emily
and
indignation
flashed
in
his
eyes
but
it
was
quickly
repressed
and
succeeded
by
an
expression
of
serious
anguish
that
induced
the
count
to
regard
him
with
more
pity
than
resentment
and
the
view
of
which
so
much
affected
emily
when
she
again
revived
that
she
yielded
to
the
weakness
of
tears
but
she
soon
restrained
them
and
exerting
her
resolution
to
appear
recovered
she
rose
thanked
the
count
and
henri
with
whom
valancourt
had
entered
the
garden
for
their
care
and
moved
towards
the
chã¢teau
without
noticing
valancourt
who
heart-struck
by
her
manner
exclaimed
in
a
low
voiceâ€”â€œgood
god
how
have
i
deserved
thisâ€”what
has
been
said
to
occasion
this
changeâ€
emily
without
replying
but
with
increased
emotion
quickened
her
steps
â€œwhat
has
thus
disordered
you
emilyâ€
said
he
as
he
still
walked
by
her
side
â€œgive
me
a
few
momentsâ€™
conversation
i
entreat
youâ€”i
am
very
miserableâ€
though
this
was
spoken
in
a
low
voice
it
was
overheard
by
the
count
who
immediately
replied
that
mademoiselle
st
aubert
was
then
too
much
indisposed
to
attend
to
any
conversation
but
that
he
would
venture
to
promise
she
would
see
monsieur
valancourt
on
the
morrow
if
she
was
better
valancourtâ€™s
cheek
was
crimsoned
he
looked
haughtily
at
the
count
and
then
at
emily
with
successive
expressions
of
surprise
grief
and
supplication
which
she
could
neither
misunderstand
nor
resist
and
she
said
languidlyâ€”â€œi
shall
be
better
tomorrow
and
if
you
wish
to
accept
the
countâ€™s
permission
i
will
see
you
thenâ€
â€œsee
meâ€
exclaimed
valancourt
as
he
threw
a
glance
of
mingled
pride
and
resentment
upon
the
count
and
then
seeming
to
recollect
himself
he
addedâ€”â€œbut
i
will
come
madam
i
will
accept
the
countâ€™s
permissionâ€
when
they
reached
the
door
of
the
chã¢teau
he
lingered
a
moment
for
his
resentment
was
now
fled
and
then
with
a
look
so
expressive
of
tenderness
and
grief
that
emilyâ€™s
heart
was
not
proof
against
it
he
bade
her
good
morning
and
bowing
slightly
to
the
count
disappeared
emily
withdrew
to
her
own
apartment
under
such
oppression
of
heart
as
she
had
seldom
known
when
she
endeavoured
to
recollect
all
that
the
count
had
told
to
examine
the
probability
of
the
circumstances
he
himself
believed
and
to
consider
of
her
future
conduct
towards
valancourt
but
when
she
attempted
to
think
her
mind
refused
control
and
she
could
only
feel
that
she
was
miserable
one
moment
she
sunk
under
the
conviction
that
valancourt
was
no
longer
the
same
whom
she
had
so
tenderly
loved
the
idea
of
whom
had
hitherto
supported
her
under
affliction
and
cheered
her
with
the
hope
of
happier
daysâ€”but
a
fallen
a
worthless
character
whom
she
must
teach
herself
to
despiseâ€”if
she
could
not
forget
then
unable
to
endure
this
terrible
supposition
she
rejected
it
and
disdained
to
believe
him
capable
of
conduct
such
as
the
count
had
described
to
whom
she
believed
he
had
been
misrepresented
by
some
artful
enemy
and
there
were
moments
when
she
even
ventured
to
doubt
the
integrity
of
the
count
himself
and
to
suspect
that
he
was
influenced
by
some
selfish
motive
to
break
her
connection
with
valancourt
but
this
was
the
error
of
an
instant
only
the
countâ€™s
character
which
she
had
heard
spoken
of
by
du
pont
and
many
other
persons
and
had
herself
observed
enabled
her
to
judge
and
forbade
the
supposition
had
her
confidence
indeed
been
less
there
appeared
to
be
no
temptation
to
betray
him
into
conduct
so
treacherous
and
so
cruel
nor
did
reflection
suffer
her
to
preserve
the
hope
that
valancourt
had
been
mis-represented
to
the
count
who
had
said
that
he
spoke
chiefly
from
his
own
observation
and
from
his
sonâ€™s
experience
she
must
part
from
valancourt
therefore
for
everâ€”for
what
of
either
happiness
or
tranquillity
could
she
expect
with
a
man
whose
tastes
were
degenerated
into
low
inclinations
and
to
whom
vice
was
become
habitual
whom
she
must
no
longer
esteem
though
the
remembrance
of
what
he
once
was
and
the
long
habit
of
loving
him
would
render
it
very
difficult
for
her
to
despise
him
â€œo
valancourtâ€
she
would
exclaim
â€œhaving
been
separated
so
longâ€”do
we
meet
only
to
be
miserableâ€”only
to
part
for
everâ€
amidst
all
the
tumult
of
her
mind
she
remembered
pertinaciously
the
seeming
candour
and
simplicity
of
his
conduct
on
the
preceding
night
and
had
she
dared
to
trust
her
own
heart
it
would
have
led
her
to
hope
much
from
this
still
she
could
not
resolve
to
dismiss
him
for
ever
without
obtaining
further
proof
of
his
ill
conduct
yet
she
saw
no
probability
of
procuring
it
if
indeed
proof
more
positive
was
possible
something
however
it
was
necessary
to
decide
upon
and
she
almost
determined
to
be
guided
in
her
opinion
solely
by
the
manner
with
which
valancourt
should
receive
her
hints
concerning
his
late
conduct
thus
passed
the
hours
till
dinner-time
when
emily
struggling
against
the
pressure
of
her
grief
dried
her
tears
and
joined
the
family
at
table
where
the
count
preserved
towards
her
the
most
delicate
attention
but
the
countess
and
mademoiselle
bearn
having
looked
for
a
moment
with
surprise
on
her
dejected
countenance
began
as
usual
to
talk
of
trifles
while
the
eyes
of
lady
blanche
asked
much
of
her
friend
who
could
only
reply
by
a
mournful
smile
emily
withdrew
as
soon
after
dinner
as
possible
and
was
followed
by
the
lady
blanche
whose
anxious
enquiries
however
she
found
herself
quite
unequal
to
answer
and
whom
she
entreated
to
spare
her
on
the
subject
of
her
distress
to
converse
on
any
topic
was
now
indeed
so
extremely
painful
to
her
that
she
soon
gave
up
the
attempt
and
blanche
left
her
with
pity
of
the
sorrow
which
she
perceived
she
had
no
power
to
assuage
emily
secretly
determined
to
go
to
her
convent
in
a
day
or
two
for
company
especially
that
of
the
countess
and
mademoiselle
bearn
was
intolerable
to
her
in
the
present
state
of
her
spirits
and
in
the
retirement
of
the
convent
as
well
as
the
kindness
of
the
abbess
she
hoped
to
recover
the
command
of
her
mind
and
to
teach
it
resignation
to
the
event
which
she
too
plainly
perceived
was
approaching
to
have
lost
valancourt
by
death
or
to
have
seen
him
married
to
a
rival
would
she
thought
have
given
her
less
anguish
than
a
conviction
of
his
unworthiness
which
must
terminate
in
misery
to
himself
and
which
robbed
her
even
of
the
solitary
image
her
heart
so
long
had
cherished
these
painful
reflections
were
interrupted
for
a
moment
by
a
note
from
valancourt
written
in
evident
distraction
of
mind
entreating
that
she
would
permit
him
to
see
her
on
the
approaching
evening
instead
of
the
following
morning
a
request
which
occasioned
her
so
much
agitation
that
she
was
unable
to
answer
it
she
wished
to
see
him
and
to
terminate
her
present
state
of
suspense
yet
shrunk
from
the
interview
and
incapable
of
deciding
for
herself
she
at
length
sent
to
beg
a
few
momentsâ€™
conversation
with
the
count
in
his
library
where
she
delivered
to
him
the
note
and
requested
his
advice
after
reading
it
he
said
that
if
she
believed
herself
well
enough
to
support
the
interview
his
opinion
was
that
for
the
relief
of
both
parties
it
ought
to
take
place
that
evening
â€œhis
affection
for
you
is
undoubtedly
a
very
sincere
oneâ€
added
the
count
â€œand
he
appears
so
much
distressed
and
you
my
amiable
friend
are
so
ill
at
easeâ€”that
the
sooner
the
affair
is
decided
the
betterâ€
emily
replied
therefore
to
valancourt
that
she
would
see
him
and
then
exerted
herself
in
endeavours
to
attain
fortitude
and
composure
to
bear
her
through
the
approaching
sceneâ€”a
scene
so
afflictingly
the
reverse
of
any
to
which
she
had
looked
forward
volume
4
is
all
the
council
that
we
two
have
shared
the
hours
that
we
have
spent
when
we
have
chid
the
hasty-footed
time
for
parting
usâ€”oh
and
is
all
forgot
and
will
you
rend
our
ancient
love
asunder
midsummer
nightâ€™s
dream
in
the
evening
when
emily
was
at
length
informed
that
count
de
villefort
requested
to
see
her
she
guessed
that
valancourt
was
below
and
endeavouring
to
assume
composure
and
to
recollect
all
her
spirits
she
rose
and
left
the
apartment
but
on
reaching
the
door
of
the
library
where
she
imagined
him
to
be
her
emotion
returned
with
such
energy
that
fearing
to
trust
herself
in
the
room
she
returned
into
the
hall
where
she
continued
for
a
considerable
time
unable
to
command
her
agitated
spirits
when
she
could
recall
them
she
found
in
the
library
valancourt
seated
with
the
count
who
both
rose
on
her
entrance
but
she
did
not
dare
to
look
at
valancourt
and
the
count
having
led
her
to
a
chair
immediately
withdrew
emily
remained
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
under
such
oppression
of
heart
that
she
could
not
speak
and
with
difficulty
breathed
while
valancourt
threw
himself
into
a
chair
beside
her
and
sighing
heavily
continued
silent
when
had
she
raised
her
eyes
she
would
have
perceived
the
violent
emotions
with
which
he
was
agitated
at
length
in
a
tremulous
voice
he
said
â€œi
have
solicited
to
see
you
this
evening
that
i
might
at
least
be
spared
the
further
torture
of
suspense
which
your
altered
manner
had
occasioned
me
and
which
the
hints
i
have
just
received
from
the
count
have
in
part
explained
i
perceive
i
have
enemies
emily
who
envied
me
my
late
happiness
and
who
have
been
busy
in
searching
out
the
means
to
destroy
it
i
perceive
too
that
time
and
absence
have
weakened
the
affection
you
once
felt
for
me
and
that
you
can
now
easily
be
taught
to
forget
meâ€
his
last
words
faltered
and
emily
less
able
to
speak
than
before
continued
silent
â€œo
what
a
meeting
is
thisâ€
exclaimed
valancourt
starting
from
his
seat
and
pacing
the
room
with
hurried
steps
â€œwhat
a
meeting
is
this
after
our
longâ€”long
separationâ€
again
he
sat
down
and
after
the
struggle
of
a
moment
he
added
in
a
firm
but
despairing
tone
â€œthis
is
too
muchâ€”i
cannot
bear
it
emily
will
you
not
speak
to
meâ€
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
as
if
to
conceal
his
emotion
and
took
emilyâ€™s
which
she
did
not
withdraw
her
tears
could
no
longer
be
restrained
and
when
he
raised
his
eyes
and
perceived
that
she
was
weeping
all
his
tenderness
returned
and
a
gleam
of
hope
appeared
to
cross
his
mind
for
he
exclaimed
â€œo
you
do
pity
me
then
you
do
love
me
yes
you
are
still
my
own
emilyâ€”let
me
believe
those
tears
that
tell
me
soâ€
emily
now
made
an
effort
to
recover
her
firmness
and
hastily
drying
them
â€œyesâ€
said
she
â€œi
do
pity
youâ€”i
weep
for
youâ€”but
ought
i
to
think
of
you
with
affection
you
may
remember
that
yester-evening
i
said
i
had
still
sufficient
confidence
in
your
candour
to
believe
that
when
i
should
request
an
explanation
of
your
words
you
would
give
it
this
explanation
is
now
unnecessary
i
understand
them
too
well
but
prove
at
least
that
your
candour
is
deserving
of
the
confidence
i
give
it
when
i
ask
you
whether
you
are
conscious
of
being
the
same
estimable
valancourtâ€”whom
i
once
lovedâ€
â€œonce
lovedâ€
cried
heâ€”â€œthe
sameâ€”the
sameâ€
he
paused
in
extreme
emotion
and
then
added
in
a
voice
at
once
solemn
and
dejectedâ€”â€œnoâ€”i
am
not
the
sameâ€”i
am
lostâ€”i
am
no
longer
worthy
of
youâ€
he
again
concealed
his
face
emily
was
too
much
affected
by
this
honest
confession
to
reply
immediately
and
while
she
struggled
to
overcome
the
pleadings
of
her
heart
and
to
act
with
the
decisive
firmness
which
was
necessary
for
her
future
peace
she
perceived
all
the
danger
of
trusting
long
to
her
resolution
in
the
presence
of
valancourt
and
was
anxious
to
conclude
an
interview
that
tortured
them
both
yet
when
she
considered
that
this
was
probably
their
last
meeting
her
fortitude
sunk
at
once
and
she
experienced
only
emotions
of
tenderness
and
of
despondency
valancourt
meanwhile
lost
in
emotions
of
remorse
and
grief
which
he
had
neither
the
power
nor
the
will
to
express
sat
insensible
almost
of
the
presence
of
emily
his
features
still
concealed
and
his
breast
agitated
by
convulsive
sighs
â€œspare
me
the
necessityâ€
said
emily
recollecting
her
fortitude
â€œspare
me
the
necessity
of
mentioning
those
circumstances
of
your
conduct
which
oblige
me
to
break
our
connection
for
everâ€”we
must
part
i
now
see
you
for
the
last
timeâ€
â€œimpossibleâ€
cried
valancourt
roused
from
his
deep
silence
â€œyou
cannot
mean
what
you
sayâ€”you
cannot
mean
to
throw
me
from
you
for
everâ€
â€œwe
must
partâ€
repeated
emily
with
emphasisâ€”â€œand
that
for
ever
your
own
conduct
has
made
this
necessaryâ€
â€œthis
is
the
countâ€™s
determinationâ€
said
he
haughtily
â€œnot
yours
and
i
shall
enquire
by
what
authority
he
interferes
between
usâ€
he
now
rose
and
walked
about
the
room
in
great
emotion
â€œlet
me
save
you
from
this
errorâ€
said
emily
not
less
agitatedâ€”â€œit
is
my
determination
and
if
you
reflect
a
moment
on
your
late
conduct
you
will
perceive
that
my
future
peace
requires
itâ€
â€œyour
future
peace
requires
that
we
should
partâ€”part
for
everâ€
said
valancourt
â€œhow
little
did
i
ever
expect
to
hear
you
say
soâ€
â€œand
how
little
did
i
expect
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
say
soâ€
rejoined
emily
while
her
voice
softened
into
tenderness
and
her
tears
flowed
againâ€”â€œthat
youâ€”you
valancourt
would
ever
fall
from
my
esteemâ€
he
was
silent
a
moment
as
if
overwhelmed
by
the
consciousness
of
no
longer
deserving
this
esteem
as
well
as
the
certainty
of
having
lost
it
and
then
with
impassioned
grief
lamented
the
criminality
of
his
late
conduct
and
the
misery
to
which
it
had
reduced
him
till
overcome
by
a
recollection
of
the
past
and
a
conviction
of
the
future
he
burst
into
tears
and
uttered
only
deep
and
broken
sighs
the
remorse
he
had
expressed
and
the
distress
he
suffered
could
not
be
witnessed
by
emily
with
indifference
and
had
she
not
called
to
her
recollection
all
the
circumstances
of
which
count
de
villefort
had
informed
her
and
all
he
had
said
of
the
danger
of
confiding
in
repentance
formed
under
the
influence
of
passion
she
might
perhaps
have
trusted
to
the
assurances
of
her
heart
and
have
forgotten
his
misconduct
in
the
tenderness
which
that
repentance
excited
valancourt
returning
to
the
chair
beside
her
at
length
said
in
a
calm
voice
â€œâ€™tis
true
i
am
fallenâ€”fallen
from
my
own
esteem
but
could
you
emily
so
soon
so
suddenly
resign
if
you
had
not
before
ceased
to
love
me
or
if
your
conduct
was
not
governed
by
the
designs
i
will
say
the
selfish
designs
of
another
person
would
you
not
otherwise
be
willing
to
hope
for
my
reformationâ€”and
could
you
bear
by
estranging
me
from
you
to
abandon
me
to
miseryâ€”to
myselfâ€â€”emily
wept
aloudâ€”â€œno
emilyâ€”noâ€”you
would
not
do
this
if
you
still
loved
me
you
would
find
your
own
happiness
in
saving
mineâ€
â€œthere
are
too
many
probabilities
against
that
hopeâ€
said
emily
â€œto
justify
me
in
trusting
the
comfort
of
my
whole
life
to
it
may
i
not
also
ask
whether
you
could
wish
me
to
do
this
if
you
really
loved
meâ€
â€œreally
loved
youâ€
exclaimed
valancourtâ€”â€œis
it
possible
you
can
doubt
my
love
yet
it
is
reasonable
that
you
should
do
so
since
you
see
that
i
am
less
ready
to
suffer
the
horror
of
parting
with
you
than
that
of
involving
you
in
my
ruin
yes
emilyâ€”i
am
ruinedâ€”irreparably
ruinedâ€”i
am
involved
in
debts
which
i
can
never
dischargeâ€
valancourtâ€™s
look
which
was
wild
as
he
spoke
this
soon
settled
into
an
expression
of
gloomy
despair
and
emily
while
she
was
compelled
to
admire
his
sincerity
saw
with
unutterable
anguish
new
reasons
for
fear
in
the
suddenness
of
his
feelings
and
the
extent
of
the
misery
in
which
they
might
involve
him
after
some
minutes
she
seemed
to
contend
against
her
grief
and
to
struggle
for
fortitude
to
conclude
the
interview
â€œi
will
not
prolong
these
momentsâ€
said
she
â€œby
a
conversation
which
can
answer
no
good
purpose
valancourt
farewellâ€
â€œyou
are
not
goingâ€
said
he
wildly
interrupting
herâ€”â€œyou
will
not
leave
me
thusâ€”you
will
not
abandon
me
even
before
my
mind
has
suggested
any
possibility
of
compromise
between
the
last
indulgence
of
my
despair
and
the
endurance
of
my
lossâ€
emily
was
terrified
by
the
sternness
of
his
look
and
said
in
a
soothing
voice
â€œyou
have
yourself
acknowledged
that
it
is
necessary
we
should
partâ€”if
you
wish
that
i
should
believe
you
love
me
you
will
repeat
the
acknowledgmentâ€â€”â€œneverâ€”neverâ€
cried
heâ€”â€œi
was
distracted
when
i
made
it
o
emilyâ€”this
is
too
muchâ€”though
you
are
not
deceived
as
to
my
faults
you
must
be
deluded
into
this
exasperation
against
them
the
count
is
the
barrier
between
us
but
he
shall
not
long
remain
soâ€
â€œyou
are
indeed
distractedâ€
said
emily
â€œthe
count
is
not
your
enemy
on
the
contrary
he
is
my
friend
and
that
might
in
some
degree
induce
you
to
consider
him
as
yoursâ€â€”â€œyour
friendâ€
said
valancourt
hastily
â€œhow
long
has
he
been
your
friend
that
he
can
so
easily
make
you
forget
your
lover
was
it
he
who
recommended
to
your
favour
the
monsieur
du
pont
who
you
say
accompanied
you
from
italy
and
who
i
say
has
stolen
your
affections
but
i
have
no
right
to
question
youâ€”you
are
your
own
mistress
du
pont
perhaps
may
not
long
triumph
over
my
fallen
fortunesâ€
emily
more
frightened
than
before
by
the
frantic
looks
of
valancourt
said
in
a
tone
scarcely
audible
â€œfor
heavenâ€™s
sake
be
reasonableâ€”be
composed
monsieur
du
pont
is
not
your
rival
nor
is
the
count
his
advocate
you
have
no
rival
nor
except
yourself
an
enemy
my
heart
is
wrung
with
anguish
which
must
increase
while
your
frantic
behaviour
shows
me
more
than
ever
that
you
are
no
longer
the
valancourt
i
have
been
accustomed
to
loveâ€
he
made
no
reply
but
sat
with
his
arms
rested
on
the
table
and
his
face
concealed
by
his
hands
while
emily
stood
silent
and
trembling
wretched
for
herself
and
dreading
to
leave
him
in
this
state
of
mind
â€œo
excess
of
miseryâ€
he
suddenly
exclaimed
â€œthat
i
can
never
lament
my
sufferings
without
accusing
myself
nor
remember
you
without
recollecting
the
folly
and
the
vice
by
which
i
have
lost
you
why
was
i
forced
to
paris
and
why
did
i
yield
to
allurements
which
were
to
make
me
despicable
for
ever
o
why
cannot
i
look
back
without
interruption
to
those
days
of
innocence
and
peace
the
days
of
our
early
loveâ€â€”the
recollection
seemed
to
melt
his
heart
and
the
frenzy
of
despair
yielded
to
tears
after
a
long
pause
turning
towards
her
and
taking
her
hand
he
said
in
a
softened
voice
â€œemily
can
you
bear
that
we
should
partâ€”can
you
resolve
to
give
up
a
heart
that
loves
you
like
mineâ€”a
heart
which
though
it
has
erredâ€”widely
erred
is
not
irretrievable
from
error
as
you
well
know
it
never
can
be
retrievable
from
loveâ€
emily
made
no
reply
but
with
her
tears
â€œcan
youâ€
continued
he
â€œcan
you
forget
all
our
former
days
of
happiness
and
confidenceâ€”when
i
had
not
a
thought
that
i
might
wish
to
conceal
from
youâ€”when
i
had
no
tasteâ€”no
pleasures
in
which
you
did
not
participateâ€
â€œo
do
not
lead
me
to
the
remembrance
of
those
daysâ€
said
emily
â€œunless
you
can
teach
me
to
forget
the
present
i
do
not
mean
to
reproach
you
if
i
did
i
should
be
spared
these
tears
but
why
will
you
render
your
present
sufferings
more
conspicuous
by
contrasting
them
with
your
former
virtuesâ€
â€œthose
virtuesâ€
said
valancourt
â€œmight
perhaps
again
be
mine
if
your
affection
which
nurtured
them
was
unchangedâ€”but
i
fear
indeed
i
see
that
you
can
no
longer
love
me
else
the
happy
hours
which
we
have
passed
together
would
plead
for
me
and
you
could
not
look
back
upon
them
unmoved
yet
why
should
i
torture
myself
with
the
remembranceâ€”why
do
i
linger
here
am
i
not
ruinedâ€”would
it
not
be
madness
to
involve
you
in
my
misfortunes
even
if
your
heart
was
still
my
own
i
will
not
distress
you
further
yet
before
i
goâ€
added
he
in
a
solemn
voice
â€œlet
me
repeat
that
whatever
may
be
my
destinyâ€”whatever
i
may
be
doomed
to
suffer
i
must
always
love
youâ€”most
fondly
love
you
i
am
going
emily
i
am
going
to
leave
youâ€”to
leave
you
for
everâ€
as
he
spoke
the
last
words
his
voice
trembled
and
he
threw
himself
again
into
the
chair
from
which
he
had
risen
emily
was
utterly
unable
to
leave
the
room
or
to
say
farewell
all
impression
of
his
criminal
conduct
and
almost
of
his
follies
was
obliterated
from
her
mind
and
she
was
sensible
only
of
pity
and
grief
â€œmy
fortitude
is
goneâ€
said
valancourt
at
length
â€œi
can
no
longer
even
struggle
to
recall
it
i
cannot
now
leave
youâ€”i
cannot
bid
you
an
eternal
farewell
say
at
least
that
you
will
see
me
once
againâ€
emilyâ€™s
heart
was
somewhat
relieved
by
the
request
and
she
endeavoured
to
believe
that
she
ought
not
to
refuse
it
yet
she
was
embarrassed
by
recollecting
that
she
was
a
visitor
in
the
house
of
the
count
who
could
not
be
pleased
by
the
return
of
valancourt
other
considerations
however
soon
overcame
this
and
she
granted
his
request
on
the
condition
that
he
would
neither
think
of
the
count
as
his
enemy
nor
du
pont
as
his
rival
he
then
left
her
with
a
heart
so
much
lightened
by
this
short
respite
that
he
almost
lost
every
former
sense
of
misfortune
emily
withdrew
to
her
own
room
that
she
might
compose
her
spirits
and
remove
the
traces
of
her
tears
which
would
encourage
the
censorious
remarks
of
the
countess
and
her
favourite
as
well
as
excite
the
curiosity
of
the
rest
of
the
family
she
found
it
however
impossible
to
tranquillize
her
mind
from
which
she
could
not
expel
the
remembrance
of
the
late
scene
with
valancourt
or
the
consciousness
that
she
was
to
see
him
again
on
the
morrow
this
meeting
now
appeared
more
terrible
to
her
than
the
last
for
the
ingenuous
confession
he
had
made
of
his
ill
conduct
and
his
embarrassed
circumstances
with
the
strength
and
tenderness
of
affection
which
this
confession
discovered
had
deeply
impressed
her
and
in
spite
of
all
she
had
heard
and
believed
to
his
disadvantage
her
esteem
began
to
return
it
frequently
appeared
to
her
impossible
that
he
could
have
been
guilty
of
the
depravities
reported
of
him
which
if
not
inconsistent
with
his
warmth
and
impetuosity
were
entirely
so
with
his
candour
and
sensibility
whatever
was
the
criminality
which
had
given
rise
to
the
reports
she
could
not
now
believe
them
to
be
wholly
true
nor
that
his
heart
was
finally
closed
against
the
charms
of
virtue
the
deep
consciousness
which
he
felt
as
well
as
expressed
of
his
errors
seemed
to
justify
the
opinion
and
as
she
understood
not
the
instability
of
youthful
dispositions
when
opposed
by
habit
and
that
professions
frequently
deceive
those
who
make
as
well
as
those
who
hear
them
she
might
have
yielded
to
the
flattering
persuasions
of
her
own
heart
and
the
pleadings
of
valancourt
had
she
not
been
guided
by
the
superior
prudence
of
the
count
he
represented
to
her
in
a
clear
light
the
danger
of
her
present
situation
that
of
listening
to
promises
of
amendment
made
under
the
influence
of
strong
passion
and
the
slight
hope
which
could
attach
to
a
connection
whose
chance
of
happiness
rested
upon
the
retrieval
of
ruined
circumstances
and
the
reform
of
corrupted
habits
on
these
accounts
he
lamented
that
emily
had
consented
to
a
second
interview
for
he
saw
how
much
it
would
shake
her
resolution
and
increase
the
difficulty
of
her
conquest
her
mind
was
now
so
entirely
occupied
by
nearer
interests
that
she
forgot
the
old
housekeeper
and
the
promised
history
which
so
lately
had
excited
her
curiosity
but
which
dorothã©e
was
probably
not
very
anxious
to
disclose
for
night
came
the
hours
passed
and
she
did
not
appear
in
emilyâ€™s
chamber
with
the
latter
it
was
a
sleepless
and
dismal
night
the
more
she
suffered
her
memory
to
dwell
on
the
late
scenes
with
valancourt
the
more
her
resolution
declined
and
she
was
obliged
to
recollect
all
the
arguments
which
the
count
had
made
use
of
to
strengthen
it
and
all
the
precepts
which
she
had
received
from
her
deceased
father
on
the
subject
of
self-command
to
enable
her
to
act
with
prudence
and
dignity
on
this
the
most
severe
occasion
of
her
life
there
were
moments
when
all
her
fortitude
forsook
her
and
when
remembering
the
confidence
of
former
times
she
thought
it
impossible
that
she
could
renounce
valancourt
his
reformation
then
appeared
certain
the
arguments
of
count
de
villefort
were
forgotten
she
readily
believed
all
she
wished
and
was
willing
to
encounter
any
evil
rather
than
that
of
an
immediate
separation
thus
passed
the
night
in
ineffectual
struggles
between
affection
and
reason
and
she
rose
in
the
morning
with
a
mind
weakened
and
irresolute
and
a
frame
trembling
with
illness
come
weep
with
meâ€”past
hope
past
cure
past
help
romeo
and
juliet
valancourt
meanwhile
suffered
the
tortures
of
remorse
and
despair
the
sight
of
emily
had
renewed
all
the
ardour
with
which
he
first
loved
her
and
which
had
suffered
a
temporary
abatement
from
absence
and
the
passing
scenes
of
busy
life
when
on
the
receipt
of
her
letter
he
set
out
for
languedoc
he
then
knew
that
his
own
folly
had
involved
him
in
ruin
and
it
was
no
part
of
his
design
to
conceal
this
from
her
but
he
lamented
only
the
delay
which
his
ill-conduct
must
give
to
their
marriage
and
did
not
foresee
that
the
information
could
induce
her
to
break
their
connection
for
ever
while
the
prospect
of
this
separation
overwhelmed
his
mind
before
stung
with
self-reproach
he
awaited
their
second
interview
in
a
state
little
short
of
distraction
yet
was
still
inclined
to
hope
that
his
pleadings
might
prevail
upon
her
not
to
exact
it
in
the
morning
he
sent
to
know
at
what
hour
she
would
see
him
and
his
note
arrived
when
she
was
with
the
count
who
had
sought
an
opportunity
of
again
conversing
with
her
of
valancourt
for
he
perceived
the
extreme
distress
of
her
mind
and
feared
more
than
ever
that
her
fortitude
would
desert
her
emily
having
dismissed
the
messenger
the
count
returned
to
the
subject
of
their
late
conversation
urging
his
fear
of
valancourtâ€™s
entreaties
and
again
pointing
out
to
her
the
lengthened
misery
that
must
ensue
if
she
should
refuse
to
encounter
some
present
uneasiness
his
repeated
arguments
could
indeed
alone
have
protected
her
from
the
affection
she
still
felt
for
valancourt
and
she
resolved
to
be
governed
by
them
the
hour
of
interview
at
length
arrived
emily
went
to
it
at
least
with
composure
of
manner
but
valancourt
was
so
much
agitated
that
he
could
not
speak
for
several
minutes
and
his
first
words
were
alternately
those
of
lamentation
entreaty
and
self-reproach
afterward
he
said
â€œemily
i
have
loved
youâ€”i
do
love
you
better
than
my
life
but
i
am
ruined
by
my
own
conduct
yet
i
would
seek
to
entangle
you
in
a
connection
that
must
be
miserable
for
you
rather
than
subject
myself
to
the
punishment
which
is
my
due
the
loss
of
you
i
am
a
wretch
but
i
will
be
a
villain
no
longerâ€”i
will
not
endeavour
to
shake
your
resolution
by
the
pleadings
of
a
selfish
passion
i
resign
you
emily
and
will
endeavour
to
find
consolation
in
considering
that
though
i
am
miserable
you
at
least
may
be
happy
the
merit
of
the
sacrifice
is
indeed
not
my
own
for
i
should
never
have
attained
strength
of
mind
to
surrender
you
if
your
prudence
had
not
demanded
itâ€
he
paused
a
moment
while
emily
attempted
to
conceal
the
tears
which
came
to
her
eyes
she
would
have
said
â€œyou
speak
now
as
you
were
wont
to
doâ€
but
she
checked
herselfâ€”â€œforgive
me
emilyâ€
said
he
â€œall
the
sufferings
i
have
occasioned
you
and
sometimes
when
you
think
of
the
wretched
valancourt
remember
that
his
only
consolation
would
be
to
believe
that
you
are
no
longer
unhappy
by
his
follyâ€
the
tears
now
fell
fast
upon
her
cheek
and
he
was
relapsing
into
the
frenzy
of
despair
when
emily
endeavoured
to
recall
her
fortitude
and
to
terminate
an
interview
which
only
seemed
to
increase
the
distress
of
both
perceiving
her
tears
and
that
she
was
rising
to
go
valancourt
struggled
once
more
to
overcome
his
own
feelings
and
to
sooth
hers
â€œthe
remembrance
of
this
sorrowâ€
said
he
â€œshall
in
future
be
my
protection
o
never
again
will
example
or
temptation
have
power
to
seduce
me
to
evil
exalted
as
i
shall
be
by
the
recollection
of
your
grief
for
meâ€
emily
was
somewhat
comforted
by
this
assurance
â€œwe
are
now
parting
for
everâ€
said
she
â€œbut
if
my
happiness
is
dear
to
you
you
will
always
remember
that
nothing
can
contribute
to
it
more
than
to
believe
that
you
have
recovered
your
own
esteemâ€
valancourt
took
her
handâ€”his
eyes
were
covered
with
tears
and
the
farewell
he
would
have
spoken
was
lost
in
sighs
after
a
few
moments
emily
said
with
difficulty
and
emotion
â€œfarewell
valancourt
may
you
be
happyâ€
she
repeated
her
â€œfarewellâ€
and
attempted
to
withdraw
her
hand
but
he
still
held
it
and
bathed
it
with
his
tears
â€œwhy
prolong
these
momentsâ€
said
emily
in
a
voice
scarcely
audible
â€œthey
are
too
painful
to
us
bothâ€
â€œthis
is
tooâ€”too
muchâ€
exclaimed
valancourt
resigning
her
hand
and
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
where
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
was
overcome
for
some
moments
by
convulsive
sighs
after
a
long
pause
during
which
emily
wept
in
silence
and
valancourt
seemed
struggling
with
his
grief
she
again
rose
to
take
leave
of
him
then
endeavouring
to
recover
his
composure
â€œi
am
again
afflicting
youâ€
said
he
â€œbut
let
the
anguish
i
suffer
plead
for
meâ€
he
then
added
in
a
solemn
voice
which
frequently
trembled
with
the
agitation
of
his
heart
â€œfarewell
emily
you
will
always
be
the
only
object
of
my
tenderness
sometimes
you
will
think
of
the
unhappy
valancourt
and
it
will
be
with
pity
though
it
may
not
be
with
esteem
o
what
is
the
whole
world
to
me
without
youâ€”without
your
esteemâ€
he
checked
himselfâ€”â€œi
am
falling
again
into
the
error
i
have
just
lamented
i
must
not
intrude
longer
upon
your
patience
or
i
shall
relapse
into
despairâ€
he
once
more
bade
emily
adieu
pressed
her
hand
to
his
lips
looked
at
her
for
the
last
time
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
emily
remained
in
the
chair
where
he
had
left
her
oppressed
with
a
pain
at
her
heart
which
scarcely
permitted
her
to
breathe
and
listening
to
his
departing
steps
sinking
fainter
and
fainter
as
he
crossed
the
hall
she
was
at
length
roused
by
the
voice
of
the
countess
in
the
garden
and
her
attention
being
then
awakened
the
first
object
which
struck
her
sight
was
the
vacant
chair
where
valancourt
had
sat
the
tears
which
had
been
for
some
time
repressed
by
the
kind
of
astonishment
that
followed
his
departure
now
came
to
her
relief
and
she
was
at
length
sufficiently
composed
to
return
to
her
own
room
this
is
no
mortal
business
nor
no
sound
that
the
earth
owes
shakespeare
we
now
return
to
the
mention
of
montoni
whose
rage
and
disappointment
were
soon
lost
in
nearer
interests
than
any
which
the
unhappy
emily
had
awakened
his
depredations
having
exceeded
their
usual
limits
and
reached
an
extent
at
which
neither
the
timidity
of
the
then
commercial
senate
of
venice
nor
their
hope
of
his
occasional
assistance
would
permit
them
to
connive
the
same
effort
it
was
resolved
should
complete
the
suppression
of
his
power
and
the
correction
of
his
outrages
while
a
corps
of
considerable
strength
was
upon
the
point
of
receiving
orders
to
march
for
udolpho
a
young
officer
prompted
partly
by
resentment
for
some
injury
received
from
montoni
and
partly
by
the
hope
of
distinction
solicited
an
interview
with
the
minister
who
directed
the
enterprise
to
him
he
represented
that
the
situation
of
udolpho
rendered
it
too
strong
to
be
taken
by
open
force
except
after
some
tedious
operations
that
montoni
had
lately
shown
how
capable
he
was
of
adding
to
its
strength
all
the
advantages
which
could
be
derived
from
the
skill
of
a
commander
that
so
considerable
a
body
of
troops
as
that
allotted
to
the
expedition
could
not
approach
udolpho
without
his
knowledge
and
that
it
was
not
for
the
honour
of
the
republic
to
have
a
large
part
of
its
regular
force
employed
for
such
a
time
as
the
siege
of
udolpho
would
require
upon
the
attack
of
a
handful
of
banditti
the
object
of
the
expedition
he
thought
might
be
accomplished
much
more
safely
and
speedily
by
mingling
contrivance
with
force
it
was
possible
to
meet
montoni
and
his
party
without
their
walls
and
to
attack
them
then
or
by
approaching
the
fortress
with
the
secrecy
consistent
with
the
march
of
smaller
bodies
of
troops
to
take
advantage
either
of
the
treachery
or
negligence
of
some
of
his
party
and
to
rush
unexpectedly
upon
the
whole
even
in
the
castle
of
udolpho
this
advice
was
seriously
attended
to
and
the
officer
who
gave
it
received
the
command
of
the
troops
demanded
for
his
purpose
his
first
efforts
were
accordingly
those
of
contrivance
alone
in
the
neighbourhood
of
udolpho
he
waited
till
he
had
secured
the
assistance
of
several
of
the
condottieri
of
whom
he
found
none
that
he
addressed
unwilling
to
punish
their
imperious
master
and
to
secure
their
own
pardon
from
the
senate
he
learned
also
the
number
of
montoniâ€™s
troops
and
that
it
had
been
much
increased
since
his
late
successes
the
conclusion
of
his
plan
was
soon
effected
having
returned
with
his
party
who
received
the
watch-word
and
other
assistance
from
their
friends
within
montoni
and
his
officers
were
surprised
by
one
division
who
had
been
directed
to
their
apartment
while
the
other
maintained
the
slight
combat
which
preceded
the
surrender
of
the
whole
garrison
among
the
persons
seized
with
montoni
was
orsino
the
assassin
who
had
joined
him
on
his
first
arrival
at
udolpho
and
whose
concealment
had
been
made
known
to
the
senate
by
count
morano
after
the
unsuccessful
attempt
of
the
latter
to
carry
off
emily
it
was
indeed
partly
for
the
purpose
of
capturing
this
man
by
whom
one
of
the
senate
had
been
murdered
that
the
expedition
was
undertaken
and
its
success
was
so
acceptable
to
them
that
morano
was
instantly
released
notwithstanding
the
political
suspicions
which
montoni
by
his
secret
accusation
had
excited
against
him
the
celerity
and
ease
with
which
this
whole
transaction
was
completed
prevented
it
from
attracting
curiosity
or
even
from
obtaining
a
place
in
any
of
the
published
records
of
that
time
so
that
emily
who
remained
in
languedoc
was
ignorant
of
the
defeat
and
signal
humiliation
of
her
late
persecutor
her
mind
was
now
occupied
with
sufferings
which
no
effort
of
reason
had
yet
been
able
to
control
count
de
villefort
who
sincerely
attempted
whatever
benevolence
could
suggest
for
softening
them
sometimes
allowed
her
the
solitude
she
wished
for
sometimes
led
her
into
friendly
parties
and
constantly
protected
her
as
much
as
possible
from
the
shrewd
enquiries
and
critical
conversation
of
the
countess
he
often
invited
her
to
make
excursions
with
him
and
his
daughter
during
which
he
conversed
entirely
on
questions
suitable
to
her
taste
without
appearing
to
consult
it
and
thus
endeavoured
gradually
to
withdraw
her
from
the
subject
of
her
grief
and
to
awake
other
interests
in
her
mind
emily
to
whom
he
appeared
as
the
enlightened
friend
and
protector
of
her
youth
soon
felt
for
him
the
tender
affection
of
a
daughter
and
her
heart
expanded
to
her
young
friend
blanche
as
to
a
sister
whose
kindness
and
simplicity
compensated
for
the
want
of
more
brilliant
qualities
it
was
long
before
she
could
sufficiently
abstract
her
mind
from
valancourt
to
listen
to
the
story
promised
by
old
dorothã©e
concerning
which
her
curiosity
had
once
been
so
deeply
interested
but
dorothã©e
at
length
reminded
her
of
it
and
emily
desired
that
she
would
come
that
night
to
her
chamber
still
her
thoughts
were
employed
by
considerations
which
weakened
her
curiosity
and
dorothã©eâ€™s
tap
at
the
door
soon
after
twelve
surprised
her
almost
as
much
as
if
it
had
not
been
appointed
â€œi
am
come
at
last
ladyâ€
said
she
â€œi
wonder
what
it
is
makes
my
old
limbs
shake
so
tonight
i
thought
once
or
twice
i
should
have
dropped
as
i
was
a-comingâ€
emily
seated
her
in
a
chair
and
desired
that
she
would
compose
her
spirits
before
she
entered
upon
the
subject
that
had
brought
her
thither
â€œalasâ€
said
dorothã©e
â€œit
is
thinking
of
that
i
believe
which
has
disturbed
me
so
in
my
way
hither
too
i
passed
the
chamber
where
my
dear
lady
died
and
everything
was
so
still
and
gloomy
about
me
that
i
almost
fancied
i
saw
her
as
she
appeared
upon
her
death-bedâ€
emily
now
drew
her
chair
near
to
dorothã©e
who
went
on
â€œit
is
about
twenty
years
since
my
lady
marchioness
came
a
bride
to
the
chã¢teau
o
i
well
remember
how
she
looked
when
she
came
into
the
great
hall
where
we
servants
were
all
assembled
to
welcome
her
and
how
happy
my
lord
the
marquis
seemed
ah
who
would
have
thought
thenâ€”but
as
i
was
saying
maâ€™amselle
i
thought
the
marchioness
with
all
her
sweet
looks
did
not
look
happy
at
heart
and
so
i
told
my
husband
and
he
said
it
was
all
fancy
so
i
said
no
more
but
i
made
my
remarks
for
all
that
my
lady
marchioness
was
then
about
your
age
and
as
i
have
often
thought
very
like
you
well
my
lord
the
marquis
kept
open
house
for
a
long
time
and
gave
such
entertainments
and
there
were
such
gay
doings
as
have
never
been
in
the
chã¢teau
since
i
was
younger
maâ€™amselle
then
than
i
am
now
and
was
as
gay
at
the
best
of
them
i
remember
i
danced
with
philip
the
butler
in
a
pink
gown
with
yellow
ribbons
and
a
coif
not
such
as
they
wear
now
but
plaited
high
with
ribbons
all
about
it
it
was
very
becoming
trulyâ€”my
lord
the
marquis
noticed
me
ah
he
was
a
good-natured
gentleman
thenâ€”who
would
have
thought
that
heâ€”â€
â€œbut
the
marchioness
dorothã©eâ€
said
emily
â€œyou
were
telling
me
of
herâ€
â€œo
yes
my
lady
marchioness
i
thought
she
did
not
seem
happy
at
heart
and
once
soon
after
the
marriage
i
caught
her
crying
in
her
chamber
but
when
she
saw
me
she
dried
her
eyes
and
pretended
to
smile
i
did
not
dare
then
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
but
the
next
time
i
saw
her
crying
i
did
and
she
seemed
displeasedâ€”so
i
said
no
more
i
found
out
some
time
after
how
it
was
her
father
it
seems
had
commanded
her
to
marry
my
lord
the
marquis
for
his
money
and
there
was
another
nobleman
or
else
a
chevalier
that
she
liked
better
and
that
was
very
fond
of
her
and
she
fretted
for
the
loss
of
him
i
fancy
but
she
never
told
me
so
my
lady
always
tried
to
conceal
her
tears
from
the
marquis
for
i
have
often
seen
her
after
she
has
been
so
sorrowful
look
so
calm
and
sweet
when
he
came
into
the
room
but
my
lord
all
of
a
sudden
grew
gloomy
and
fretful
and
very
unkind
sometimes
to
my
lady
this
afflicted
her
very
much
as
i
saw
for
she
never
complained
and
she
used
to
try
so
sweetly
to
oblige
him
and
to
bring
him
into
a
good
humour
that
my
heart
has
often
ached
to
see
it
but
he
used
to
be
stubborn
and
give
her
harsh
answers
and
then
when
she
found
it
all
in
vain
she
would
go
to
her
own
room
and
cry
so
i
used
to
hear
her
in
the
ante-room
poor
dear
lady
but
i
seldom
ventured
to
go
to
her
i
used
sometimes
to
think
my
lord
was
jealous
to
be
sure
my
lady
was
greatly
admired
but
she
was
too
good
to
deserve
suspicion
among
the
many
chevaliers
that
visited
at
the
chã¢teau
there
was
one
that
i
always
thought
seemed
just
suited
for
my
lady
he
was
so
courteous
yet
so
spirited
and
there
was
such
a
grace
as
it
were
in
all
he
did
or
said
i
always
observed
that
whenever
he
had
been
there
the
marquis
was
more
gloomy
and
my
lady
more
thoughtful
and
it
came
into
my
head
that
this
was
the
chevalier
she
ought
to
have
married
but
i
never
could
learn
for
certainâ€
â€œwhat
was
the
chevalierâ€™s
name
dorothã©eâ€
said
emily
â€œwhy
that
i
will
not
tell
even
to
you
maâ€™amselle
for
evil
may
come
of
it
i
once
heard
from
a
person
who
is
since
dead
that
the
marchioness
was
not
in
law
the
wife
of
the
marquis
for
that
she
had
before
been
privately
married
to
the
gentleman
she
was
so
much
attached
to
and
was
afterwards
afraid
to
own
it
to
her
father
who
was
a
very
stern
man
but
this
seems
very
unlikely
and
i
never
gave
much
faith
to
it
as
i
was
saying
the
marquis
was
most
out
of
humour
as
i
thought
when
the
chevalier
i
spoke
of
had
been
at
the
chã¢teau
and
at
last
his
ill
treatment
of
my
lady
made
her
quite
miserable
he
would
see
hardly
any
visitors
at
the
castle
and
made
her
live
almost
by
herself
i
was
her
constant
attendant
and
saw
all
she
suffered
but
still
she
never
complained
â€œafter
matters
had
gone
on
thus
for
near
a
year
my
lady
was
taken
ill
and
i
thought
her
long
fretting
had
made
her
soâ€”but
alas
i
fear
it
was
worse
than
thatâ€
â€œworse
dorothã©eâ€
said
emily
â€œcan
that
be
possibleâ€
â€œi
fear
it
was
so
madam
there
were
strange
appearances
but
i
will
only
tell
what
happened
my
lord
the
marquisâ€”â€
â€œhush
dorothã©e
what
sounds
were
thoseâ€
said
emily
dorothã©e
changed
countenance
and
while
they
both
listened
they
heard
on
the
stillness
of
the
night
music
of
uncommon
sweetness
â€œi
have
surely
heard
that
voice
beforeâ€
said
emily
at
length
â€œi
have
often
heard
it
and
at
this
same
hourâ€
said
dorothã©e
solemnly
â€œand
if
spirits
ever
bring
musicâ€”that
is
surely
the
music
of
oneâ€
emily
as
the
sounds
drew
nearer
knew
them
to
be
the
same
she
had
formerly
heard
at
the
time
of
her
fatherâ€™s
death
and
whether
it
was
the
remembrance
they
now
revived
of
that
melancholy
event
or
that
she
was
struck
with
superstitious
awe
it
is
certain
she
was
so
much
affected
that
she
had
nearly
fainted
â€œi
think
i
once
told
you
madamâ€
said
dorothã©e
â€œthat
i
first
heard
this
music
soon
after
my
ladyâ€™s
death
i
well
remember
the
nightâ€â€”
â€œhark
it
comes
againâ€
said
emily
â€œlet
us
open
the
window
and
listenâ€
they
did
so
but
soon
the
sounds
floated
gradually
away
into
distance
and
all
was
again
still
they
seemed
to
have
sunk
among
the
woods
whose
tufted
tops
were
visible
upon
the
clear
horizon
while
every
other
feature
of
the
scene
was
involved
in
the
night-shade
which
however
allowed
the
eye
an
indistinct
view
of
some
objects
in
the
garden
below
as
emily
leaned
on
the
window
gazing
with
a
kind
of
thrilling
awe
upon
the
obscurity
beneath
and
then
upon
the
cloudless
arch
above
enlightened
only
by
the
stars
dorothã©e
in
a
low
voice
resumed
her
narrative
â€œi
was
saying
maâ€™amselle
that
i
well
remember
when
first
i
heard
that
music
it
was
one
night
soon
after
my
ladyâ€™s
death
that
i
had
sat
up
later
than
usual
and
i
donâ€™t
know
how
it
was
but
i
had
been
thinking
a
great
deal
about
my
poor
mistress
and
of
the
sad
scene
i
had
lately
witnessed
the
chã¢teau
was
quite
still
and
i
was
in
the
chamber
at
a
good
distance
from
the
rest
of
the
servants
and
this
with
the
mournful
things
i
had
been
thinking
of
i
suppose
made
me
low
spirited
for
i
felt
very
lonely
and
forlorn
as
it
were
and
listened
often
wishing
to
hear
a
sound
in
the
chã¢teau
for
you
know
maâ€™amselle
when
one
can
hear
people
moving
one
does
not
so
much
mind
about
oneâ€™s
fears
but
all
the
servants
were
gone
to
bed
and
i
sat
thinking
and
thinking
till
i
was
almost
afraid
to
look
round
the
room
and
my
poor
ladyâ€™s
countenance
often
came
to
my
mind
such
as
i
had
seen
her
when
she
was
dying
and
once
or
twice
i
almost
thought
i
saw
her
before
meâ€”when
suddenly
i
heard
such
sweet
music
it
seemed
just
at
my
window
and
i
shall
never
forget
what
i
felt
i
had
not
power
to
move
from
my
chair
but
then
when
i
thought
it
was
my
dear
ladyâ€™s
voice
the
tears
came
to
my
eyes
i
had
often
heard
her
sing
in
her
life-time
and
to
be
sure
she
had
a
very
fine
voice
it
had
made
me
cry
to
hear
her
many
a
time
when
she
has
sat
in
her
oriel
of
an
evening
playing
upon
her
lute
such
sad
songs
and
singing
so
o
it
went
to
oneâ€™s
heart
i
have
listened
in
the
ante-chamber
for
the
hour
together
and
she
would
sometimes
sit
playing
with
the
window
open
when
it
was
summer
time
till
it
was
quite
dark
and
when
i
have
gone
in
to
shut
it
she
has
hardly
seemed
to
know
what
hour
it
was
but
as
i
said
madamâ€
continued
dorothã©e
â€œwhen
first
i
heard
the
music
that
came
just
now
i
thought
it
was
my
late
ladyâ€™s
and
i
have
often
thought
so
again
when
i
have
heard
it
as
i
have
done
at
intervals
ever
since
sometimes
many
months
have
gone
by
but
still
it
has
returnedâ€
â€œit
is
extraordinaryâ€
observed
emily
â€œthat
no
person
has
yet
discovered
the
musicianâ€
â€œaye
maâ€™amselle
if
it
had
been
anything
earthly
it
would
have
been
discovered
long
ago
but
who
could
have
courage
to
follow
a
spirit
and
if
they
had
what
good
could
it
doâ€”for
spirits
you
know
maâ€™am
can
take
any
shape
or
no
shape
and
they
will
be
here
one
minute
and
the
next
perhaps
in
a
quite
different
placeâ€
â€œpray
resume
your
story
of
the
marchionessâ€
said
emily
â€œand
acquaint
me
with
the
manner
of
her
deathâ€
â€œi
will
maâ€™amâ€
said
dorothã©e
â€œbut
shall
we
leave
the
windowâ€
â€œthis
cool
air
refreshes
meâ€
replied
emily
â€œand
i
love
to
hear
it
creep
along
the
woods
and
to
look
upon
this
dusky
landscape
you
were
speaking
of
my
lord
the
marquis
when
the
music
interrupted
usâ€
â€œyes
madam
my
lord
the
marquis
became
more
and
more
gloomy
and
my
lady
grew
worse
and
worse
till
one
night
she
was
taken
very
ill
indeed
i
was
called
up
and
when
i
came
to
her
bedside
i
was
shocked
to
see
her
countenanceâ€”it
was
so
changed
she
looked
piteously
up
at
me
and
desired
i
would
call
the
marquis
again
for
he
was
not
yet
come
and
tell
him
she
had
something
particular
to
say
to
him
at
last
he
came
and
he
did
to
be
sure
seem
very
sorry
to
see
her
but
he
said
very
little
my
lady
told
him
she
felt
herself
to
be
dying
and
wished
to
speak
with
him
alone
and
then
i
left
the
room
but
i
shall
never
forget
his
look
as
i
wentâ€
â€œwhen
i
returned
i
ventured
to
remind
my
lord
about
sending
for
a
doctor
for
i
supposed
he
had
forgot
to
do
so
in
his
grief
but
my
lady
said
it
was
then
too
late
but
my
lord
so
far
from
thinking
so
seemed
to
think
light
of
her
disorderâ€”till
she
was
seized
with
such
terrible
pains
o
i
never
shall
forget
her
shriek
my
lord
then
sent
off
a
man
and
horse
for
the
doctor
and
walked
about
the
room
and
all
over
the
chã¢teau
in
the
greatest
distress
and
i
staid
by
my
dear
lady
and
did
what
i
could
to
ease
her
sufferings
she
had
intervals
of
ease
and
in
one
of
these
she
sent
for
my
lord
again
when
he
came
i
was
going
but
she
desired
i
would
not
leave
her
o
i
shall
never
forget
what
a
scene
passedâ€”i
can
hardly
bear
to
think
of
it
now
my
lord
was
almost
distracted
for
my
lady
behaved
with
so
much
goodness
and
took
such
pains
to
comfort
him
that
if
he
ever
had
suffered
a
suspicion
to
enter
his
head
he
must
now
have
been
convinced
he
was
wrong
and
to
be
sure
he
did
seem
to
be
overwhelmed
with
the
thought
of
his
treatment
of
her
and
this
affected
her
so
much
that
she
fainted
away
â€œwe
then
got
my
lord
out
of
the
room
he
went
into
his
library
and
threw
himself
on
the
floor
and
there
he
staid
and
would
hear
no
reason
that
was
talked
to
him
when
my
lady
recovered
she
enquired
for
him
but
afterwards
said
she
could
not
bear
to
see
his
grief
and
desired
we
would
let
her
die
quietly
she
died
in
my
arms
maâ€™amselle
and
she
went
off
as
peacefully
as
a
child
for
all
the
violence
of
her
disorder
was
passedâ€
dorothã©e
paused
and
wept
and
emily
wept
with
her
for
she
was
much
affected
by
the
goodness
of
the
late
marchioness
and
by
the
meek
patience
with
which
she
had
suffered
â€œwhen
the
doctor
cameâ€
resumed
dorothã©e
â€œalas
he
came
too
late
he
appeared
greatly
shocked
to
see
her
for
soon
after
her
death
a
frightful
blackness
spread
all
over
her
face
when
he
had
sent
the
attendants
out
of
the
room
he
asked
me
several
odd
questions
about
the
marchioness
particularly
concerning
the
manner
in
which
she
had
been
seized
and
he
often
shook
his
head
at
my
answers
and
seemed
to
mean
more
than
he
chose
to
say
but
i
understood
him
too
well
however
i
kept
my
remarks
to
myself
and
only
told
them
to
my
husband
who
bade
me
hold
my
tongue
some
of
the
other
servants
however
suspected
what
i
did
and
strange
reports
were
whispered
about
the
neighbourhood
but
nobody
dared
to
make
any
stir
about
them
when
my
lord
heard
that
my
lady
was
dead
he
shut
himself
up
and
would
see
nobody
but
the
doctor
who
used
to
be
with
him
alone
sometimes
for
an
hour
together
and
after
that
the
doctor
never
talked
with
me
again
about
my
lady
when
she
was
buried
in
the
church
of
the
convent
at
a
little
distance
yonder
if
the
moon
was
up
you
might
see
the
towers
here
maâ€™amselle
all
my
lordâ€™s
vassals
followed
the
funeral
and
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
among
them
for
she
had
done
a
deal
of
good
among
the
poor
my
lord
the
marquis
i
never
saw
anybody
so
melancholy
as
he
was
afterwards
and
sometimes
he
would
be
in
such
fits
of
violence
that
we
almost
thought
he
had
lost
his
senses
he
did
not
stay
long
at
the
chã¢teau
but
joined
his
regiment
and
soon
after
all
the
servants
except
my
husband
and
i
received
notice
to
go
for
my
lord
went
to
the
wars
i
never
saw
him
after
for
he
would
not
return
to
the
chã¢teau
though
it
is
such
a
fine
place
and
never
finished
those
fine
rooms
he
was
building
on
the
west
side
of
it
and
it
has
in
a
manner
been
shut
up
ever
since
till
my
lord
the
count
came
hereâ€
â€œthe
death
of
the
marchioness
appears
extraordinaryâ€
said
emily
who
was
anxious
to
know
more
than
she
dared
to
ask
â€œyes
madamâ€
replied
dorothã©e
â€œit
was
extraordinary
i
have
told
you
all
i
saw
and
you
may
easily
guess
what
i
think
i
cannot
say
more
because
i
would
not
spread
reports
that
might
offend
my
lord
the
countâ€
â€œyou
are
very
rightâ€
said
emilyâ€”â€œwhere
did
the
marquis
dieâ€â€”â€œin
the
north
of
france
i
believe
maâ€™amselleâ€
replied
dorothã©e
â€œi
was
very
glad
when
i
heard
my
lord
the
count
was
coming
for
this
had
been
a
sad
desolate
place
these
many
years
and
we
heard
such
strange
noises
sometimes
after
my
ladyâ€™s
death
that
as
i
told
you
before
my
husband
and
i
left
it
for
a
neighbouring
cottage
and
now
lady
i
have
told
you
all
this
sad
history
and
all
my
thoughts
and
you
have
promised
you
know
never
to
give
the
least
hint
about
itâ€â€”â€œi
haveâ€
said
emily
â€œand
i
will
be
faithful
to
my
promise
dorothã©eâ€”what
you
have
told
has
interested
me
more
than
you
can
imagine
i
only
wish
i
could
prevail
upon
you
to
tell
the
name
of
the
chevalier
whom
you
thought
so
deserving
of
the
marchionessâ€
dorothã©e
however
steadily
refused
to
do
this
and
then
returned
to
the
notice
of
emilyâ€™s
likeness
to
the
late
marchioness
â€œthere
is
another
picture
of
herâ€
added
she
â€œhanging
in
a
room
of
the
suite
which
was
shut
up
it
was
drawn
as
i
have
heard
before
she
was
married
and
is
much
more
like
you
than
the
miniatureâ€
when
emily
expressed
a
strong
desire
to
see
this
dorothã©e
replied
that
she
did
not
like
to
open
those
rooms
but
emily
reminded
her
that
the
count
had
talked
the
other
day
of
ordering
them
to
be
opened
of
which
dorothã©e
seemed
to
consider
much
and
then
she
owned
that
she
should
feel
less
if
she
went
into
them
with
emily
first
than
otherwise
and
at
length
promised
to
show
the
picture
the
night
was
too
far
advanced
and
emily
was
too
much
affected
by
the
narrative
of
the
scenes
which
had
passed
in
those
apartments
to
wish
to
visit
them
at
this
hour
but
she
requested
that
dorothã©e
would
return
on
the
following
night
when
they
were
not
likely
to
be
observed
and
conduct
her
thither
besides
her
wish
to
examine
the
portrait
she
felt
a
thrilling
curiosity
to
see
the
chamber
in
which
the
marchioness
had
died
and
which
dorothã©e
had
said
remained
with
the
bed
and
furniture
just
as
when
the
corpse
was
removed
for
interment
the
solemn
emotions
which
the
expectation
of
viewing
such
a
scene
had
awakened
were
in
unison
with
the
present
tone
of
her
mind
depressed
by
severe
disappointment
cheerful
objects
rather
added
to
than
removed
this
depression
but
perhaps
she
yielded
too
much
to
her
melancholy
inclination
and
imprudently
lamented
the
misfortune
which
no
virtue
of
her
own
could
have
taught
her
to
avoid
though
no
effort
of
reason
could
make
her
look
unmoved
upon
the
self-degradation
of
him
whom
she
had
once
esteemed
and
loved
dorothã©e
promised
to
return
on
the
following
night
with
the
keys
of
the
chambers
and
then
wished
emily
good
repose
and
departed
emily
however
continued
at
the
window
musing
upon
the
melancholy
fate
of
the
marchioness
and
listening
in
awful
expectation
for
a
return
of
the
music
but
the
stillness
of
the
night
remained
long
unbroken
except
by
the
murmuring
sounds
of
the
woods
as
they
waved
in
the
breeze
and
then
by
the
distant
bell
of
the
convent
striking
one
she
now
withdrew
from
the
window
and
as
she
sat
at
her
bedside
indulging
melancholy
reveries
which
the
loneliness
of
the
hour
assisted
the
stillness
was
suddenly
interrupted
not
by
music
but
by
very
uncommon
sounds
that
seemed
to
come
either
from
the
room
adjoining
her
own
or
from
one
below
the
terrible
catastrophe
that
had
been
related
to
her
together
with
the
mysterious
circumstances
said
to
have
since
occurred
in
the
chã¢teau
had
so
much
shocked
her
spirits
that
she
now
sunk
for
a
moment
under
the
weakness
of
superstition
the
sounds
however
did
not
return
and
she
retired
to
forget
in
sleep
the
disastrous
story
she
had
heard
now
it
is
the
time
of
night
that
the
graves
all
gaping
wide
every
one
lets
forth
his
sprite
in
the
church-way
path
to
glide
shakespeare
on
the
next
night
about
the
same
hour
as
before
dorothã©e
came
to
emilyâ€™s
chamber
with
the
keys
of
that
suite
of
rooms
which
had
been
particularly
appropriated
to
the
late
marchioness
these
extended
along
the
north
side
of
the
chã¢teau
forming
part
of
the
old
building
and
as
emilyâ€™s
room
was
in
the
south
they
had
to
pass
over
a
great
extent
of
the
castle
and
by
the
chambers
of
several
of
the
family
whose
observations
dorothã©e
was
anxious
to
avoid
since
it
might
excite
enquiry
and
raise
reports
such
as
would
displease
the
count
she
therefore
requested
that
emily
would
wait
half
an
hour
before
they
ventured
forth
that
they
might
be
certain
all
the
servants
were
gone
to
bed
it
was
nearly
one
before
the
chã¢teau
was
perfectly
still
or
dorothã©e
thought
it
prudent
to
leave
the
chamber
in
this
interval
her
spirits
seemed
to
be
greatly
affected
by
the
remembrance
of
past
events
and
by
the
prospect
of
entering
again
upon
places
where
these
had
occurred
and
in
which
she
had
not
been
for
so
many
years
emily
too
was
affected
but
her
feelings
had
more
of
solemnity
and
less
of
fear
from
the
silence
into
which
reflection
and
expectation
had
thrown
them
they
at
length
roused
themselves
and
left
the
chamber
dorothã©e
at
first
carried
the
lamp
but
her
hand
trembled
so
much
with
infirmity
and
alarm
that
emily
took
it
from
her
and
offered
her
arm
to
support
her
feeble
steps
they
had
to
descend
the
great
staircase
and
after
passing
over
a
wide
extent
of
the
chã¢teau
to
ascend
another
which
led
to
the
suite
of
rooms
they
were
in
quest
of
they
stepped
cautiously
along
the
open
corridor
that
ran
round
the
great
hall
and
into
which
the
chambers
of
the
count
countess
and
the
lady
blanche
opened
and
from
thence
descending
the
chief
staircase
they
crossed
the
hall
itself
proceeding
through
the
servants
hall
where
the
dying
embers
of
a
wood
fire
still
glimmered
on
the
hearth
and
the
supper
table
was
surrounded
by
chairs
that
obstructed
their
passage
they
came
to
the
foot
of
the
back
staircase
old
dorothã©e
here
paused
and
looked
around
â€œlet
us
listenâ€
said
she
â€œif
anything
is
stirring
maâ€™amselle
do
you
hear
any
voiceâ€
â€œnoneâ€
said
emily
â€œthere
certainly
is
no
person
up
in
the
chã¢teau
besides
ourselvesâ€â€”â€œno
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
dorothã©e
â€œbut
i
have
never
been
here
at
this
hour
before
and
after
what
i
know
my
fears
are
not
wonderfulâ€â€”â€œwhat
do
you
knowâ€
said
emilyâ€”â€œo
maâ€™amselle
we
have
no
time
for
talking
now
let
us
go
on
that
door
on
the
left
is
the
one
we
must
openâ€
they
proceeded
and
having
reached
the
top
of
the
staircase
dorothã©e
applied
the
key
to
the
lock
â€œahâ€
said
she
as
she
endeavoured
to
turn
it
â€œso
many
years
have
passed
since
this
was
opened
that
i
fear
it
will
not
moveâ€
emily
was
more
successful
and
they
presently
entered
a
spacious
and
ancient
chamber
â€œalasâ€
exclaimed
dorothã©e
as
she
entered
â€œthe
last
time
i
passed
through
this
doorâ€”i
followed
my
poor
ladyâ€™s
corpseâ€
emily
struck
with
the
circumstance
and
affected
by
the
dusky
and
solemn
air
of
the
apartment
remained
silent
and
they
passed
on
through
a
long
suite
of
rooms
till
they
came
to
one
more
spacious
than
the
rest
and
rich
in
the
remains
of
faded
magnificence
â€œlet
us
rest
here
awhile
madamâ€
said
dorothã©e
faintly
â€œwe
are
going
into
the
chamber
where
my
lady
died
that
door
opens
into
it
ah
maâ€™amselle
why
did
you
persuade
me
to
comeâ€
emily
drew
one
of
the
massy
arm-chairs
with
which
the
apartment
was
furnished
and
begged
dorothã©e
would
sit
down
and
try
to
compose
her
spirits
â€œhow
the
sight
of
this
place
brings
all
that
passed
formerly
to
my
mindâ€
said
dorothã©e
â€œit
seems
as
if
it
was
but
yesterday
since
all
that
sad
affair
happenedâ€
â€œhark
what
noise
is
thatâ€
said
emily
dorothã©e
half
starting
from
her
chair
looked
round
the
apartment
and
they
listenedâ€”but
everything
remaining
still
the
old
woman
spoke
again
upon
the
subject
of
her
sorrow
â€œthis
saloon
maâ€™amselle
was
in
my
ladyâ€™s
time
the
finest
apartment
in
the
chã¢teau
and
it
was
fitted
up
according
to
her
own
taste
all
this
grand
furniture
but
you
can
now
hardly
see
what
it
is
for
the
dust
and
our
light
is
none
of
the
bestâ€”ah
how
i
have
seen
this
room
lighted
up
in
my
ladyâ€™s
timeâ€”all
this
grand
furniture
came
from
paris
and
was
made
after
the
fashion
of
some
in
the
louvre
there
except
those
large
glasses
and
they
came
from
some
outlandish
place
and
that
rich
tapestry
how
the
colours
are
faded
alreadyâ€”since
i
saw
it
lastâ€
â€œi
understood
that
was
twenty
years
agoâ€
observed
emily
â€œthereabout
madamâ€
said
dorothã©e
â€œand
well
remembered
but
all
the
time
between
then
and
now
seems
as
nothing
that
tapestry
used
to
be
greatly
admired
at
it
tells
the
stories
out
of
some
famous
book
or
other
but
i
have
forgot
the
nameâ€
emily
now
rose
to
examine
the
figures
it
exhibited
and
discovered
by
verses
in
the
provenã§al
tongue
wrought
underneath
each
scene
that
it
exhibited
stories
from
some
of
the
most
celebrated
ancient
romances
dorothã©eâ€™s
spirits
being
now
more
composed
she
rose
and
unlocked
the
door
that
led
into
the
late
marchionessâ€™s
apartment
and
emily
passed
into
a
lofty
chamber
hung
round
with
dark
arras
and
so
spacious
that
the
lamp
she
held
up
did
not
show
its
extent
while
dorothã©e
when
she
entered
had
dropped
into
a
chair
where
sighing
deeply
she
scarcely
trusted
herself
with
the
view
of
a
scene
so
affecting
to
her
it
was
some
time
before
emily
perceived
through
the
dusk
the
bed
on
which
the
marchioness
was
said
to
have
died
when
advancing
to
the
upper
end
of
the
room
she
discovered
the
high
canopied
tester
of
dark
green
damask
with
the
curtains
descending
to
the
floor
in
the
fashion
of
a
tent
half
drawn
and
remaining
apparently
as
they
had
been
left
twenty
years
before
and
over
the
whole
bedding
was
thrown
a
counterpane
or
pall
of
black
velvet
that
hung
down
to
the
floor
emily
shuddered
as
she
held
the
lamp
over
it
and
looked
within
the
dark
curtains
where
she
almost
expected
to
have
seen
a
human
face
and
suddenly
remembering
the
horror
she
had
suffered
upon
discovering
the
dying
madame
montoni
in
the
turret-chamber
of
udolpho
her
spirits
fainted
and
she
was
turning
from
the
bed
when
dorothã©e
who
had
now
reached
it
exclaimed
â€œholy
virgin
methinks
i
see
my
lady
stretched
upon
that
pallâ€”as
when
last
i
saw
herâ€
emily
shocked
by
this
exclamation
looked
involuntarily
again
within
the
curtains
but
the
blackness
of
the
pall
only
appeared
while
dorothã©e
was
compelled
to
support
herself
upon
the
side
of
the
bed
and
presently
tears
brought
her
some
relief
â€œahâ€
said
she
after
she
had
wept
awhile
â€œit
was
here
i
sat
on
that
terrible
night
and
held
my
ladyâ€™s
hand
and
heard
her
last
words
and
saw
all
her
sufferingsâ€”here
she
died
in
my
armsâ€
â€œdo
not
indulge
these
painful
recollectionsâ€
said
emily
â€œlet
us
go
show
me
the
picture
you
mentioned
if
it
will
not
too
much
affect
youâ€
â€œit
hangs
in
the
orielâ€
said
dorothã©e
rising
and
going
towards
a
small
door
near
the
bedâ€™s
head
which
she
opened
and
emily
followed
with
the
light
into
the
closet
of
the
late
marchioness
â€œalas
there
she
is
maâ€™amselleâ€
said
dorothã©e
pointing
to
a
portrait
of
a
lady
â€œthere
is
her
very
self
just
as
she
looked
when
she
came
first
to
the
chã¢teau
you
see
madam
she
was
all
blooming
like
you
thenâ€”and
so
soon
to
be
cut
offâ€
while
dorothã©e
spoke
emily
was
attentively
examining
the
picture
which
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
miniature
though
the
expression
of
the
countenance
in
each
was
somewhat
different
but
still
she
thought
she
perceived
something
of
that
pensive
melancholy
in
the
portrait
which
so
strongly
characterised
the
miniature
â€œpray
maâ€™amselle
stand
beside
the
picture
that
i
may
look
at
you
togetherâ€
said
dorothã©e
who
when
the
request
was
complied
with
exclaimed
again
at
the
resemblance
emily
also
as
she
gazed
upon
it
thought
that
she
had
somewhere
seen
a
person
very
like
it
though
she
could
not
now
recollect
who
this
was
in
this
closet
were
many
memorials
of
the
departed
marchioness
a
robe
and
several
articles
of
her
dress
were
scattered
upon
the
chairs
as
if
they
had
just
been
thrown
off
on
the
floor
were
a
pair
of
black
satin
slippers
and
on
the
dressing-table
a
pair
of
gloves
and
a
long
black
veil
which
as
emily
took
it
up
to
examine
she
perceived
was
dropping
to
pieces
with
age
â€œahâ€
said
dorothã©e
observing
the
veil
â€œmy
ladyâ€™s
hand
laid
it
there
it
has
never
been
moved
sinceâ€
emily
shuddering
immediately
laid
it
down
again
â€œi
well
remember
seeing
her
take
it
offâ€
continued
dorothã©e
â€œit
was
on
the
night
before
her
death
when
she
had
returned
from
a
little
walk
i
had
persuaded
her
to
take
in
the
gardens
and
she
seemed
refreshed
by
it
i
told
her
how
much
better
she
looked
and
i
remember
what
a
languid
smile
she
gave
me
but
alas
she
little
thought
or
i
either
that
she
was
to
die
that
nightâ€
dorothã©e
wept
again
and
then
taking
up
the
veil
threw
it
suddenly
over
emily
who
shuddered
to
find
it
wrapped
round
her
descending
even
to
her
feet
and
as
she
endeavoured
to
throw
it
off
dorothã©e
entreated
that
she
would
keep
it
on
for
one
moment
â€œi
thoughtâ€
added
she
â€œhow
like
you
would
look
to
my
dear
mistress
in
that
veilâ€”may
your
life
maâ€™amselle
be
a
happier
one
than
hersâ€
emily
having
disengaged
herself
from
the
veil
laid
it
again
on
the
dressing-table
and
surveyed
the
closet
where
every
object
on
which
her
eye
fixed
seemed
to
speak
of
the
marchioness
in
a
large
oriel
window
of
painted
glass
stood
a
table
with
a
silver
crucifix
and
a
prayer-book
open
and
emily
remembered
with
emotion
what
dorothã©e
had
mentioned
concerning
her
custom
of
playing
on
her
lute
in
this
window
before
she
observed
the
lute
itself
lying
on
a
corner
of
the
table
as
if
it
had
been
carelessly
placed
there
by
the
hand
that
had
so
often
awakened
it
â€œthis
is
a
sad
forlorn
placeâ€
said
dorothã©e
â€œfor
when
my
dear
lady
died
i
had
no
heart
to
put
it
to
rights
or
the
chamber
either
and
my
lord
never
came
into
the
rooms
after
so
they
remain
just
as
they
did
when
my
lady
was
removed
for
intermentâ€
while
dorothã©e
spoke
emily
was
still
looking
on
the
lute
which
was
a
spanish
one
and
remarkably
large
and
then
with
a
hesitating
hand
she
took
it
up
and
passed
her
fingers
over
the
chords
they
were
out
of
tune
but
uttered
a
deep
and
full
sound
dorothã©e
started
at
their
well-known
tones
and
seeing
the
lute
in
emilyâ€™s
hand
said
â€œthis
is
the
lute
my
lady
marchioness
loved
so
i
remember
when
last
she
played
upon
itâ€”it
was
on
the
night
that
she
died
i
came
as
usual
to
undress
her
and
as
i
entered
the
bed-chamber
i
heard
the
sound
of
music
from
the
oriel
and
perceiving
it
was
my
ladyâ€™s
who
was
sitting
there
i
stepped
softly
to
the
door
which
stood
a
little
open
to
listen
for
the
musicâ€”though
it
was
mournfulâ€”was
so
sweet
there
i
saw
her
with
the
lute
in
her
hand
looking
upwards
and
the
tears
fell
upon
her
cheeks
while
she
sung
a
vesper
hymn
so
soft
and
so
solemn
and
her
voice
trembled
as
it
were
and
then
she
would
stop
for
a
moment
and
wipe
away
her
tears
and
go
on
again
lower
than
before
o
i
had
often
listened
to
my
lady
but
never
heard
anything
so
sweet
as
this
it
made
me
cry
almost
to
hear
it
she
had
been
at
prayers
i
fancy
for
there
was
the
book
open
on
the
table
beside
herâ€”aye
and
there
it
lies
open
still
pray
let
us
leave
the
oriel
maâ€™amselleâ€
added
dorothã©e
â€œthis
is
a
heart-breaking
placeâ€
having
returned
into
the
chamber
she
desired
to
look
once
more
upon
the
bed
when
as
they
came
opposite
to
the
open
door
leading
into
the
saloon
emily
in
the
partial
gleam
which
the
lamp
threw
into
it
thought
she
saw
something
glide
along
into
the
obscurer
part
of
the
room
her
spirits
had
been
much
affected
by
the
surrounding
scene
or
it
is
probable
this
circumstance
whether
real
or
imaginary
would
not
have
affected
her
in
the
degree
it
did
but
she
endeavoured
to
conceal
her
emotion
from
dorothã©e
who
however
observing
her
countenance
change
enquired
if
she
was
ill
â€œlet
us
goâ€
said
emily
faintly
â€œthe
air
of
these
rooms
is
unwholesomeâ€
but
when
she
attempted
to
do
so
considering
that
she
must
pass
through
the
apartment
where
the
phantom
of
her
terror
had
appeared
this
terror
increased
and
too
faint
to
support
herself
she
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
dorothã©e
believing
that
she
was
only
affected
by
a
consideration
of
the
melancholy
catastrophe
which
had
happened
on
this
spot
endeavoured
to
cheer
her
and
then
as
they
sat
together
on
the
bed
she
began
to
relate
other
particulars
concerning
it
and
this
without
reflecting
that
it
might
increase
emilyâ€™s
emotion
but
because
they
were
particularly
interesting
to
herself
â€œa
little
before
my
ladyâ€™s
deathâ€
said
she
â€œwhen
the
pains
were
gone
off
she
called
me
to
her
and
stretching
out
her
hand
to
me
i
sat
down
just
thereâ€”where
the
curtain
falls
upon
the
bed
how
well
i
remember
her
look
at
the
timeâ€”death
was
in
itâ€”i
can
almost
fancy
i
see
her
nowâ€”there
she
lay
maâ€™amselleâ€”her
face
was
upon
the
pillow
there
this
black
counterpane
was
not
upon
the
bed
then
it
was
laid
on
after
her
death
and
she
was
laid
out
upon
itâ€
emily
turned
to
look
within
the
dusky
curtains
as
if
she
could
have
seen
the
countenance
of
which
dorothã©e
spoke
the
edge
of
the
white
pillow
only
appeared
above
the
blackness
of
the
pall
but
as
her
eyes
wandered
over
the
pall
itself
she
fancied
she
saw
it
move
without
speaking
she
caught
dorothã©eâ€™s
arm
who
surprised
by
the
action
and
by
the
look
of
terror
that
accompanied
it
turned
her
eyes
from
emily
to
the
bed
where
in
the
next
moment
she
too
saw
the
pall
slowly
lifted
and
fall
again
emily
attempted
to
go
but
dorothã©e
stood
fixed
and
gazing
upon
the
bed
and
at
length
saidâ€”â€œit
is
only
the
wind
that
waves
it
maâ€™amselle
we
have
left
all
the
doors
open
see
how
the
air
waves
the
lamp
tooâ€”it
is
only
the
windâ€
she
had
scarcely
uttered
these
words
when
the
pall
was
more
violently
agitated
than
before
but
emily
somewhat
ashamed
of
her
terrors
stepped
back
to
the
bed
willing
to
be
convinced
that
the
wind
only
had
occasioned
her
alarm
when
as
she
gazed
within
the
curtains
the
pall
moved
again
and
in
the
next
moment
the
apparition
of
a
human
countenance
rose
above
it
screaming
with
terror
they
both
fled
and
got
out
of
the
chamber
as
fast
as
their
trembling
limbs
would
bear
them
leaving
open
the
doors
of
all
the
rooms
through
which
they
passed
when
they
reached
the
staircase
dorothã©e
threw
open
a
chamber
door
where
some
of
the
female
servants
slept
and
sunk
breathless
on
the
bed
while
emily
deprived
of
all
presence
of
mind
made
only
a
feeble
attempt
to
conceal
the
occasion
of
her
terror
from
the
astonished
servants
and
though
dorothã©e
when
she
could
speak
endeavoured
to
laugh
at
her
own
fright
and
was
joined
by
emily
no
remonstrances
could
prevail
with
the
servants
who
had
quickly
taken
the
alarm
to
pass
even
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
a
room
so
near
to
these
terrific
chambers
dorothã©e
having
accompanied
emily
to
her
own
apartment
they
then
began
to
talk
over
with
some
degree
of
coolness
the
strange
circumstance
that
had
just
occurred
and
emily
would
almost
have
doubted
her
own
perceptions
had
not
those
of
dorothã©e
attested
their
truth
having
now
mentioned
what
she
had
observed
in
the
outer
chamber
she
asked
the
housekeeper
whether
she
was
certain
no
door
had
been
left
unfastened
by
which
a
person
might
secretly
have
entered
the
apartments
dorothã©e
replied
that
she
had
constantly
kept
the
keys
of
the
several
doors
in
her
own
possession
that
when
she
had
gone
her
rounds
through
the
castle
as
she
frequently
did
to
examine
if
all
was
safe
she
had
tried
these
doors
among
the
rest
and
had
always
found
them
fastened
it
was
therefore
impossible
she
added
that
any
person
could
have
got
admittance
into
the
apartments
and
if
they
couldâ€”it
was
very
improbable
they
should
have
chosen
to
sleep
in
a
place
so
cold
and
forlorn
emily
observed
that
their
visit
to
these
chambers
had
perhaps
been
watched
and
that
some
person
for
a
frolic
had
followed
them
into
the
rooms
with
a
design
to
frighten
them
and
while
they
were
in
the
oriel
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
concealing
himself
in
the
bed
dorothã©e
allowed
that
this
was
possible
till
she
recollected
that
on
entering
the
apartments
she
had
turned
the
key
of
the
outer
door
and
this
which
had
been
done
to
prevent
their
visit
being
noticed
by
any
of
the
family
who
might
happen
to
be
up
must
effectually
have
excluded
every
person
except
themselves
from
the
chambers
and
she
now
persisted
in
affirming
that
the
ghastly
countenance
she
had
seen
was
nothing
human
but
some
dreadful
apparition
emily
was
very
solemnly
affected
of
whatever
nature
might
be
the
appearance
she
had
witnessed
whether
human
or
supernatural
the
fate
of
the
deceased
marchioness
was
a
truth
not
to
be
doubted
and
this
unaccountable
circumstance
occurring
in
the
very
scene
of
her
sufferings
affected
emilyâ€™s
imagination
with
a
superstitious
awe
to
which
after
having
detected
the
fallacies
at
udolpho
she
might
not
have
yielded
had
she
been
ignorant
of
the
unhappy
story
related
by
the
housekeeper
her
she
now
solemnly
conjured
to
conceal
the
occurrence
of
this
night
and
to
make
light
of
the
terror
she
had
already
betrayed
that
the
count
might
not
be
distressed
by
reports
which
would
certainly
spread
alarm
and
confusion
among
his
family
â€œtimeâ€
she
added
â€œmay
explain
this
mysterious
affair
meanwhile
let
us
watch
the
event
in
silenceâ€
dorothã©e
readily
acquiesced
but
she
now
recollected
that
she
had
left
all
the
doors
of
the
north
suite
of
rooms
open
and
not
having
courage
to
return
alone
to
lock
even
the
outer
one
emily
after
some
effort
so
far
conquered
her
own
fears
that
she
offered
to
accompany
her
to
the
foot
of
the
back
staircase
and
to
wait
there
while
dorothã©e
ascended
whose
resolution
being
reassured
by
this
circumstance
she
consented
to
go
and
they
left
emilyâ€™s
apartment
together
no
sound
disturbed
the
stillness
as
they
passed
along
the
halls
and
galleries
but
on
reaching
the
foot
of
the
back
staircase
dorothã©eâ€™s
resolution
failed
again
having
however
paused
a
moment
to
listen
and
no
sound
being
heard
above
she
ascended
leaving
emily
below
and
scarcely
suffering
her
eye
to
glance
within
the
first
chamber
she
fastened
the
door
which
shut
up
the
whole
suite
of
apartments
and
returned
to
emily
as
they
stepped
along
the
passage
leading
into
the
great
hall
a
sound
of
lamentation
was
heard
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
hall
itself
and
they
stopped
in
new
alarm
to
listen
when
emily
presently
distinguished
the
voice
of
annette
whom
she
found
crossing
the
hall
with
another
female
servant
and
so
terrified
by
the
report
which
the
other
maids
had
spread
that
believing
she
could
be
safe
only
where
her
lady
was
she
was
going
for
refuge
to
her
apartment
emilyâ€™s
endeavours
to
laugh
or
to
argue
her
out
of
these
terrors
were
equally
vain
and
in
compassion
to
her
distress
she
consented
that
she
should
remain
in
her
room
during
the
night
hail
mildly-pleasing
solitude
companion
of
the
wise
and
good
thine
is
the
balmy
breath
of
morn
just
as
the
dew-bent
rose
is
born
but
chief
when
evening
scenes
decay
and
the
faint
landscape
swims
away
thine
is
the
doubtful
soft
decline
and
that
best
hour
of
musing
thine
thomson
emilyâ€™s
injunctions
to
annette
to
be
silent
on
the
subject
of
her
terror
were
ineffectual
and
the
occurrence
of
the
preceding
night
spread
such
alarm
among
the
servants
who
now
all
affirmed
that
they
had
frequently
heard
unaccountable
noises
in
the
chã¢teau
that
a
report
soon
reached
the
count
of
the
north
side
of
the
castle
being
haunted
he
treated
this
at
first
with
ridicule
but
perceiving
that
it
was
productive
of
serious
evil
in
the
confusion
it
occasioned
among
his
household
he
forbade
any
person
to
repeat
it
on
pain
of
punishment
the
arrival
of
a
party
of
his
friends
soon
withdrew
his
thoughts
entirely
from
this
subject
and
his
servants
had
now
little
leisure
to
brood
over
it
except
indeed
in
the
evenings
after
supper
when
they
all
assembled
in
their
hall
and
related
stories
of
ghosts
till
they
feared
to
look
round
the
room
started
if
the
echo
of
a
closing
door
murmured
along
the
passage
and
refused
to
go
singly
to
any
part
of
the
castle
on
these
occasions
annette
made
a
distinguished
figure
when
she
told
not
only
of
all
the
wonders
she
had
witnessed
but
of
all
that
she
had
imagined
in
the
castle
of
udolpho
with
the
story
of
the
strange
disappearance
of
signora
laurentini
she
made
no
trifling
impression
on
the
mind
of
her
attentive
auditors
her
suspicions
concerning
montoni
she
would
also
have
freely
disclosed
had
not
ludovico
who
was
now
in
the
service
of
the
count
prudently
checked
her
loquacity
whenever
it
pointed
to
that
subject
among
the
visitors
at
the
chã¢teau
was
the
baron
de
saint
foix
an
old
friend
of
the
count
and
his
son
the
chevalier
st
foix
a
sensible
and
amiable
young
man
who
having
in
the
preceding
year
seen
the
lady
blanche
at
paris
had
become
her
declared
admirer
the
friendship
which
the
count
had
long
entertained
for
his
father
and
the
equality
of
their
circumstances
made
him
secretly
approve
of
the
connection
but
thinking
his
daughter
at
this
time
too
young
to
fix
her
choice
for
life
and
wishing
to
prove
the
sincerity
and
strength
of
the
chevalierâ€™s
attachment
he
then
rejected
his
suit
though
without
forbidding
his
future
hope
this
young
man
now
came
with
the
baron
his
father
to
claim
the
reward
of
a
steady
affection
a
claim
which
the
count
admitted
and
which
blanche
did
not
reject
while
these
visitors
were
at
the
chã¢teau
it
became
a
scene
of
gaiety
and
splendour
the
pavilion
in
the
woods
was
fitted
up
and
frequented
in
the
fine
evenings
as
a
supper-room
when
the
hour
usually
concluded
with
a
concert
at
which
the
count
and
countess
who
were
scientific
performers
and
the
chevaliers
henri
and
st
foix
with
the
lady
blanche
and
emily
whose
voices
and
fine
taste
compensated
for
the
want
of
more
skilful
execution
usually
assisted
several
of
the
countâ€™s
servants
performed
on
horns
and
other
instruments
some
of
which
placed
at
a
little
distance
among
the
woods
spoke
in
sweet
response
to
the
harmony
that
proceeded
from
the
pavilion
at
any
other
period
these
parties
would
have
been
delightful
to
emily
but
her
spirits
were
now
oppressed
with
a
melancholy
which
she
perceived
that
no
kind
of
what
is
called
amusement
had
power
to
dissipate
and
which
the
tender
and
frequently
pathetic
melody
of
these
concerts
sometimes
increased
to
a
very
painful
degree
she
was
particularly
fond
of
walking
in
the
woods
that
hung
on
a
promontory
overlooking
the
sea
their
luxuriant
shade
was
soothing
to
her
pensive
mind
and
in
the
partial
views
which
they
afforded
of
the
mediterranean
with
its
winding
shores
and
passing
sails
tranquil
beauty
was
united
with
grandeur
the
paths
were
rude
and
frequently
overgrown
with
vegetation
but
their
tasteful
owner
would
suffer
little
to
be
done
to
them
and
scarcely
a
single
branch
to
be
lopped
from
the
venerable
trees
on
an
eminence
in
one
of
the
most
sequestered
parts
of
these
woods
was
a
rustic
seat
formed
of
the
trunk
of
a
decayed
oak
which
had
once
been
a
noble
tree
and
of
which
many
lofty
branches
still
flourishing
united
with
beech
and
pines
to
over-canopy
the
spot
beneath
their
deep
umbrage
the
eye
passed
over
the
tops
of
other
woods
to
the
mediterranean
and
to
the
left
through
an
opening
was
seen
a
ruined
watch-tower
standing
on
a
point
of
rock
near
the
sea
and
rising
from
among
the
tufted
foliage
hither
emily
often
came
alone
in
the
silence
of
evening
and
soothed
by
the
scenery
and
by
the
faint
murmur
that
rose
from
the
waves
would
sit
till
darkness
obliged
her
to
return
to
the
chã¢teau
frequently
also
she
visited
the
watch-tower
which
commanded
the
entire
prospect
and
when
she
leaned
against
its
broken
walls
and
thought
of
valancourt
she
not
once
imagined
what
was
so
true
that
this
tower
had
been
almost
as
frequently
his
resort
as
her
own
since
his
estrangement
from
the
neighbouring
chã¢teau
one
evening
she
lingered
here
to
a
late
hour
she
had
sat
on
the
steps
of
the
building
watching
in
tranquil
melancholy
the
gradual
effect
of
evening
over
the
extensive
prospect
till
the
grey
waters
of
the
mediterranean
and
the
massy
woods
were
almost
the
only
features
of
the
scene
that
remained
visible
when
as
she
gazed
alternately
on
these
and
on
the
mild
blue
of
the
heavens
where
the
first
pale
star
of
evening
appeared
she
personified
the
hour
in
the
following
linesâ€”
song
of
the
evening
hour
last
of
the
hours
that
track
the
fading
day
i
move
along
the
realms
of
twilight
air
and
hear
remote
the
choral
song
decay
of
sister-nymphs
who
dance
around
his
car
then
as
i
follow
through
the
azure
void
his
partial
splendour
from
my
straining
eye
sinks
in
the
depth
of
space
my
only
guide
his
faint
ray
dawning
on
the
farthest
sky
save
that
sweet
lingering
strain
of
gayer
hours
whose
close
my
voice
prolongs
in
dying
notes
while
mortals
on
the
green
earth
own
its
powâ€™rs
as
downward
on
the
evening
gale
it
floats
when
fades
along
the
west
the
sunâ€™s
last
beam
as
weary
to
the
nether
world
he
goes
and
mountain-summits
catch
the
purple
gleam
and
slumbering
ocean
faint
and
fainter
glows
silent
upon
the
globeâ€™s
broad
shade
i
steal
and
oâ€™er
its
dry
turf
shed
the
cooling
dews
and
evâ€™ry
feverâ€™d
herb
and
flowâ€™ret
heal
and
all
their
fragrance
on
the
air
diffuse
whereâ€™er
i
move
a
tranquil
pleasure
reigns
oâ€™er
all
the
scene
the
dusky
tints
i
send
that
forests
wild
and
mountains
stretching
plains
and
peopled
towns
in
soft
confusion
blend
wide
oâ€™er
the
world
i
waft
the
freshâ€™ning
wind
low
breathing
through
the
woods
and
twilight
vale
in
whispers
soft
that
woo
the
pensive
mind
of
him
who
loves
my
lonely
steps
to
hail
his
tender
oaten
reed
i
watch
to
hear
stealing
its
sweetness
oâ€™er
some
plaining
rill
or
soothing
oceanâ€™s
wave
when
storms
are
near
or
swelling
in
the
breeze
from
distant
hill
i
wake
the
fairy
elves
who
shun
the
light
when
from
their
blossomâ€™d
beds
they
slily
peep
and
spy
my
pale
star
leading
on
the
nightâ€”
forth
to
their
games
and
revelry
they
leap
send
all
the
prisonâ€™d
sweets
abroad
in
air
that
with
them
slumberâ€™d
in
the
flowâ€™retâ€™s
cell
then
to
the
shores
and
moonlight
brooks
repair
till
the
high
larks
their
matin-carol
swell
the
wood-nymphs
hail
my
airs
and
temperâ€™d
shade
with
ditties
soft
and
lightly
sportive
dance
on
river
margin
of
some
bowâ€™ry
glade
and
strew
their
fresh
buds
as
my
steps
advance
but
swift
i
pass
and
distant
regions
trace
for
moonbeams
silver
all
the
eastern
cloud
and
dayâ€™s
last
crimson
vestige
fades
apace
down
the
steep
west
i
fly
from
midnightâ€™s
shroud
the
moon
was
now
rising
out
of
the
sea
she
watched
its
gradual
progress
the
extending
line
of
radiance
it
threw
upon
the
waters
the
sparkling
oars
the
sail
faintly
silvered
and
the
wood-tops
and
the
battlements
of
the
watch-tower
at
whose
foot
she
was
sitting
just
tinted
with
the
rays
emilyâ€™s
spirits
were
in
harmony
with
this
scene
as
she
sat
meditating
sounds
stole
by
her
on
the
air
which
she
immediately
knew
to
be
the
music
and
the
voice
she
had
formerly
heard
at
midnight
and
the
emotion
of
awe
which
she
felt
was
not
unmixed
with
terror
when
she
considered
her
remote
and
lonely
situation
the
sounds
drew
nearer
she
would
have
risen
to
leave
the
place
but
they
seemed
to
come
from
the
way
she
must
have
taken
towards
the
chã¢teau
and
she
awaited
the
event
in
trembling
expectation
the
sounds
continued
to
approach
for
some
time
and
then
ceased
emily
sat
listening
gazing
and
unable
to
move
when
she
saw
a
figure
emerge
from
the
shade
of
the
woods
and
pass
along
the
bank
at
some
little
distance
before
her
it
went
swiftly
and
her
spirits
were
so
overcome
with
awe
that
though
she
saw
she
did
not
much
observe
it
having
left
the
spot
with
a
resolution
never
again
to
visit
it
alone
at
so
late
an
hour
she
began
to
approach
the
chã¢teau
when
she
heard
voices
calling
her
from
the
part
of
the
wood
which
was
nearest
to
it
they
were
the
shouts
of
the
countâ€™s
servants
who
were
sent
to
search
for
her
and
when
she
entered
the
supper-room
where
he
sat
with
henri
and
blanche
he
gently
reproached
her
with
a
look
which
she
blushed
to
have
deserved
this
little
occurrence
deeply
impressed
her
mind
and
when
she
withdrew
to
her
own
room
it
recalled
so
forcibly
the
circumstances
she
had
witnessed
a
few
nights
before
that
she
had
scarcely
courage
to
remain
alone
she
watched
to
a
late
hour
when
no
sound
having
renewed
her
fears
she
at
length
sunk
to
repose
but
this
was
of
short
continuance
for
she
was
disturbed
by
a
loud
and
unusual
noise
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
gallery
into
which
her
chamber
opened
groans
were
distinctly
heard
and
immediately
after
a
dead
weight
fell
against
the
door
with
a
violence
that
threatened
to
burst
it
open
she
called
loudly
to
know
who
was
there
but
received
no
answer
though
at
intervals
she
still
thought
she
heard
something
like
a
low
moaning
fear
deprived
her
of
the
power
to
move
soon
after
she
heard
footsteps
in
a
remote
part
of
the
gallery
and
as
they
approached
she
called
more
loudly
than
before
till
the
steps
paused
at
her
door
she
then
distinguished
the
voices
of
several
of
the
servants
who
seemed
too
much
engaged
by
some
circumstance
without
to
attend
to
her
calls
but
annette
soon
after
entering
the
room
for
water
emily
understood
that
one
of
the
maids
had
fainted
whom
she
immediately
desired
them
to
bring
into
her
room
where
she
assisted
to
restore
her
when
this
girl
had
recovered
her
speech
she
affirmed
that
as
she
was
passing
up
the
back
staircase
in
the
way
to
her
chamber
she
had
seen
an
apparition
on
the
second
landing-place
she
held
the
lamp
low
she
said
that
she
might
pick
her
way
several
of
the
stairs
being
infirm
and
even
decayed
and
it
was
upon
raising
her
eyes
that
she
saw
this
appearance
it
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
corner
of
the
landing-place
which
she
was
approaching
and
then
gliding
up
the
stairs
vanished
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
that
had
been
lately
opened
she
heard
afterwards
a
hollow
sound
â€œthen
the
devil
has
got
a
key
to
that
apartmentâ€
said
dorothã©e
â€œfor
it
could
be
nobody
but
he
i
locked
the
door
myselfâ€
the
girl
springing
down
the
stairs
and
passing
up
the
great
staircase
had
run
with
a
faint
scream
till
she
reached
the
gallery
where
she
fell
groaning
at
emilyâ€™s
door
gently
chiding
her
for
the
alarm
she
had
occasioned
emily
tried
to
make
her
ashamed
of
her
fears
but
the
girl
persisted
in
saying
that
she
had
seen
an
apparition
till
she
went
to
her
own
room
whither
she
was
accompanied
by
all
the
servants
present
except
dorothã©e
who
at
emilyâ€™s
request
remained
with
her
during
the
night
emily
was
perplexed
and
dorothã©e
was
terrified
and
mentioned
many
occurrences
of
former
times
which
had
long
since
confirmed
her
superstitions
among
these
according
to
her
belief
she
had
once
witnessed
an
appearance
like
that
just
described
and
on
the
very
same
spot
and
it
was
the
remembrance
of
it
that
had
made
her
pause
when
she
was
going
to
ascend
the
stairs
with
emily
and
which
had
increased
her
reluctance
to
open
the
north
apartments
whatever
might
be
emilyâ€™s
opinions
she
did
not
disclose
them
but
listened
attentively
to
all
that
dorothã©e
communicated
which
occasioned
her
much
thought
and
perplexity
from
this
night
the
terror
of
the
servants
increased
to
such
an
excess
that
several
of
them
determined
to
leave
the
chã¢teau
and
requested
their
discharge
of
the
count
who
if
he
had
any
faith
in
the
subject
of
their
alarm
thought
proper
to
dissemble
it
and
anxious
to
avoid
the
inconvenience
that
threatened
him
employed
ridicule
and
then
argument
to
convince
them
they
had
nothing
to
apprehend
from
supernatural
agency
but
fear
had
rendered
their
minds
inaccessible
to
reason
and
it
was
now
that
ludovico
proved
at
once
his
courage
and
his
gratitude
for
the
kindness
he
had
received
from
the
count
by
offering
to
watch
during
a
night
in
the
suite
of
rooms
reputed
to
be
haunted
he
feared
he
said
no
spirits
and
if
anything
of
human
form
appearedâ€”he
would
prove
that
he
dreaded
that
as
little
the
count
paused
upon
the
offer
while
the
servants
who
heard
it
looked
upon
one
another
in
doubt
and
amazement
and
annette
terrified
for
the
safety
of
ludovico
employed
tears
and
entreaties
to
dissuade
him
from
his
purpose
â€œyou
are
a
bold
fellowâ€
said
the
count
smiling
â€œthink
well
of
what
you
are
going
to
encounter
before
you
finally
determine
upon
it
however
if
you
persevere
in
your
resolution
i
will
accept
your
offer
and
your
intrepidity
shall
not
go
unrewardedâ€
â€œi
desire
no
reward
your
excellenzaâ€
replied
ludovico
â€œbut
your
approbation
your
excellenza
has
been
sufficiently
good
to
me
already
but
i
wish
to
have
arms
that
i
may
be
equal
to
my
enemy
if
he
should
appearâ€
â€œyour
sword
cannot
defend
you
against
a
ghostâ€
replied
the
count
throwing
a
glance
of
irony
upon
the
other
servants
â€œneither
can
bars
nor
bolts
for
a
spirit
you
know
can
glide
through
a
keyhole
as
easily
as
through
a
doorâ€
â€œgive
me
a
sword
my
lord
countâ€
said
ludovico
â€œand
i
will
lay
all
the
spirits
that
shall
attack
me
in
the
red
seaâ€
â€œwellâ€
said
the
count
â€œyou
shall
have
a
sword
and
good
cheer
too
and
your
brave
comrades
here
will
perhaps
have
courage
enough
to
remain
another
night
in
the
chã¢teau
since
your
boldness
will
certainly
for
this
night
at
least
confine
all
the
malice
of
the
spectre
to
yourselfâ€
curiosity
now
struggled
with
fear
in
the
minds
of
several
of
his
fellow
servants
and
at
length
they
resolved
to
await
the
event
of
ludovicoâ€™s
rashness
emily
was
surprised
and
concerned
when
she
heard
of
his
intention
and
was
frequently
inclined
to
mention
what
she
had
witnessed
in
the
north
apartments
to
the
count
for
she
could
not
entirely
divest
herself
of
fears
for
ludovicoâ€™s
safety
though
her
reason
represented
these
to
be
absurd
the
necessity
however
of
concealing
the
secret
with
which
dorothã©e
had
entrusted
her
and
which
must
have
been
mentioned
with
the
late
occurrence
in
excuse
for
her
having
so
privately
visited
the
north
apartments
kept
her
entirely
silent
on
the
subject
of
her
apprehension
and
she
tried
only
to
sooth
annette
who
held
that
ludovico
was
certainly
to
be
destroyed
and
who
was
much
less
affected
by
emilyâ€™s
consolatory
efforts
than
by
the
manner
of
old
dorothã©e
who
often
as
she
exclaimed
ludovico
sighed
and
threw
up
her
eyes
to
heaven
ye
gods
of
quiet
and
of
sleep
profound
whose
soft
dominion
oâ€™er
this
castle
sways
and
all
the
widely-silent
places
round
forgive
me
if
my
trembling
pen
displays
what
never
yet
was
sung
in
mortal
lays
thomson
the
count
gave
orders
for
the
north
apartments
to
be
opened
and
prepared
for
the
reception
of
ludovico
but
dorothã©e
remembering
what
she
had
lately
witnessed
there
feared
to
obey
and
not
one
of
the
other
servants
daring
to
venture
thither
the
rooms
remained
shut
up
till
the
time
when
ludovico
was
to
retire
thither
for
the
night
an
hour
for
which
the
whole
household
waited
with
impatience
after
supper
ludovico
by
the
order
of
the
count
attended
him
in
his
closet
where
they
remained
alone
for
near
half
an
hour
and
on
leaving
which
his
lord
delivered
to
him
a
sword
â€œit
has
seen
service
in
mortal
quarrelsâ€
said
the
count
jocosely
â€œyou
will
use
it
honourably
no
doubt
in
a
spiritual
one
tomorrow
let
me
hear
that
there
is
not
one
ghost
remaining
in
the
chã¢teauâ€
ludovico
received
it
with
a
respectful
bow
â€œyou
shall
be
obeyed
my
lordâ€
said
he
â€œi
will
engage
that
no
spectre
shall
disturb
the
peace
of
the
chã¢teau
after
this
nightâ€
they
now
returned
to
the
supper-room
where
the
countâ€™s
guests
awaited
to
accompany
him
and
ludovico
to
the
door
of
the
north
apartments
and
dorothã©e
being
summoned
for
the
keys
delivered
them
to
ludovico
who
then
led
the
way
followed
by
most
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
chã¢teau
having
reached
the
back
staircase
several
of
the
servants
shrunk
back
and
refused
to
go
further
but
the
rest
followed
him
to
the
top
of
the
staircase
where
a
broad
landing-place
allowed
them
to
flock
round
him
while
he
applied
the
key
to
the
door
during
which
they
watched
him
with
as
much
eager
curiosity
as
if
he
had
been
performing
some
magical
rite
ludovico
unaccustomed
to
the
lock
could
not
turn
it
and
dorothã©e
who
had
lingered
far
behind
was
called
forward
under
whose
hand
the
door
opened
slowly
and
her
eye
glancing
within
the
dusky
chamber
she
uttered
a
sudden
shriek
and
retreated
at
this
signal
of
alarm
the
greater
part
of
the
crowd
hurried
down
the
stairs
and
the
count
henri
and
ludovico
were
left
alone
to
pursue
the
enquiry
who
instantly
rushed
into
the
apartment
ludovico
with
a
drawn
sword
which
he
had
just
time
to
draw
from
the
scabbard
the
count
with
the
lamp
in
his
hand
and
henri
carrying
a
basket
containing
provisions
for
the
courageous
adventurer
having
looked
hastily
round
the
first
room
where
nothing
appeared
to
justify
alarm
they
passed
on
to
the
second
and
here
too
all
being
quiet
they
proceeded
to
a
third
with
a
more
tempered
step
the
count
had
now
leisure
to
smile
at
the
discomposure
into
which
he
had
been
surprised
and
to
ask
ludovico
in
which
room
he
designed
to
pass
the
night
â€œthere
are
several
chambers
beyond
these
your
excellenzaâ€
said
ludovico
pointing
to
a
door
â€œand
in
one
of
them
is
a
bed
they
say
i
will
pass
the
night
there
and
when
i
am
weary
of
watching
i
can
lie
downâ€
â€œgoodâ€
said
the
count
â€œlet
us
go
on
you
see
these
rooms
show
nothing
but
damp
walls
and
decaying
furniture
i
have
been
so
much
engaged
since
i
came
to
the
chã¢teau
that
i
have
not
looked
into
them
till
now
remember
ludovico
to
tell
the
housekeeper
tomorrow
to
throw
open
these
windows
the
damask
hangings
are
dropping
to
pieces
i
will
have
them
taken
down
and
this
antique
furniture
removedâ€
â€œdear
sirâ€
said
henri
â€œhere
is
an
arm-chair
so
massy
with
gilding
that
it
resembles
one
of
the
state
chairs
at
the
louvre
more
then
anything
elseâ€
â€œyesâ€
said
the
count
stopping
a
moment
to
survey
it
â€œthere
is
a
history
belonging
to
that
chair
but
i
have
not
time
to
tell
itâ€”let
us
pass
on
this
suite
runs
to
a
greater
extent
than
i
had
imagined
it
is
many
years
since
i
was
in
them
but
where
is
the
bedroom
you
speak
of
ludovicoâ€”these
are
only
ante-chambers
to
the
great
drawing-room
i
remember
them
in
their
splendourâ€
â€œthe
bed
my
lordâ€
replied
ludovico
â€œthey
told
me
was
in
a
room
that
opens
beyond
the
saloon
and
terminates
the
suiteâ€
â€œo
here
is
the
saloonâ€
said
the
count
as
they
entered
the
spacious
apartment
in
which
emily
and
dorothã©e
had
rested
he
here
stood
for
a
moment
surveying
the
reliques
of
faded
grandeur
which
it
exhibitedâ€”the
sumptuous
tapestryâ€”the
long
and
low
sophas
of
velvet
with
frames
heavily
carved
and
gildedâ€”the
floor
inlaid
with
small
squares
of
fine
marble
and
covered
in
the
centre
with
a
piece
of
very
rich
tapestry-workâ€”the
casements
of
painted
glass
and
the
large
venetian
mirrors
of
a
size
and
quality
such
as
at
that
period
france
could
not
make
which
reflected
on
every
side
the
spacious
apartment
these
had
formerly
also
reflected
a
gay
and
brilliant
scene
for
this
had
been
the
state-room
of
the
chã¢teau
and
here
the
marchioness
had
held
the
assemblies
that
made
part
of
the
festivities
of
her
nuptials
if
the
wand
of
a
magician
could
have
recalled
the
vanished
groups
many
of
them
vanished
even
from
the
earth
that
once
had
passed
over
these
polished
mirrors
what
a
varied
and
contrasted
picture
would
they
have
exhibited
with
the
present
now
instead
of
a
blaze
of
lights
and
a
splendid
and
busy
crowd
they
reflected
only
the
rays
of
the
one
glimmering
lamp
which
the
count
held
up
and
which
scarcely
served
to
show
the
three
forlorn
figures
that
stood
surveying
the
room
and
the
spacious
and
dusky
walls
around
them
â€œahâ€
said
the
count
to
henri
awaking
from
his
deep
reverie
â€œhow
the
scene
is
changed
since
last
i
saw
it
i
was
a
young
man
then
and
the
marchioness
was
alive
and
in
her
bloom
many
other
persons
were
here
too
who
are
now
no
more
there
stood
the
orchestra
here
we
tripped
in
many
a
sprightly
mazeâ€”the
walls
echoing
to
the
dance
now
they
resound
only
one
feeble
voiceâ€”and
even
that
will
ere
long
be
heard
no
more
my
son
remember
that
i
was
once
as
young
as
yourself
and
that
you
must
pass
away
like
those
who
have
preceded
youâ€”like
those
who
as
they
sung
and
danced
in
this
once
gay
apartment
forgot
that
years
are
made
up
of
moments
and
that
every
step
they
took
carried
them
nearer
to
their
graves
but
such
reflections
are
useless
i
had
almost
said
criminal
unless
they
teach
us
to
prepare
for
eternity
since
otherwise
they
cloud
our
present
happiness
without
guiding
us
to
a
future
one
but
enough
of
this
let
us
go
onâ€
ludovico
now
opened
the
door
of
the
bedroom
and
the
count
as
he
entered
was
struck
with
the
funereal
appearance
which
the
dark
arras
gave
to
it
he
approached
the
bed
with
an
emotion
of
solemnity
and
perceiving
it
to
be
covered
with
the
pall
of
black
velvet
paused
â€œwhat
can
this
meanâ€
said
he
as
he
gazed
upon
it
â€œi
have
heard
my
lordâ€
said
ludovico
as
he
stood
at
the
feet
looking
within
the
canopied
curtains
â€œthat
the
lady
marchioness
de
villeroi
died
in
this
chamber
and
remained
here
till
she
was
removed
to
be
buried
and
this
perhaps
signor
may
account
for
the
pallâ€
the
count
made
no
reply
but
stood
for
a
few
moments
engaged
in
thought
and
evidently
much
affected
then
turning
to
ludovico
he
asked
him
with
a
serious
air
whether
he
thought
his
courage
would
support
him
through
the
night
â€œif
you
doubt
thisâ€
added
the
count
â€œdo
not
be
ashamed
to
own
it
i
will
release
you
from
your
engagement
without
exposing
you
to
the
triumphs
of
your
fellow-servantsâ€
ludovico
paused
pride
and
something
very
like
fear
seemed
struggling
in
his
breast
pride
however
was
victoriousâ€”he
blushed
and
his
hesitation
ceased
â€œno
my
lordâ€
said
he
â€œi
will
go
through
with
what
i
have
begun
and
i
am
grateful
for
your
consideration
on
that
hearth
i
will
make
a
fire
and
with
the
good
cheer
in
this
basket
i
doubt
not
i
shall
do
wellâ€
â€œbe
it
soâ€
said
the
count
â€œbut
how
will
you
beguile
the
tediousness
of
the
night
if
you
do
not
sleepâ€
â€œwhen
i
am
weary
my
lordâ€
replied
ludovico
â€œi
shall
not
fear
to
sleep
in
the
meanwhile
i
have
a
book
that
will
entertain
meâ€
â€œwellâ€
said
the
count
â€œi
hope
nothing
will
disturb
you
but
if
you
should
be
seriously
alarmed
in
the
night
come
to
my
apartment
i
have
too
much
confidence
in
your
good
sense
and
courage
to
believe
you
will
be
alarmed
on
slight
grounds
or
suffer
the
gloom
of
this
chamber
or
its
remote
situation
to
overcome
you
with
ideal
terrors
tomorrow
i
shall
have
to
thank
you
for
an
important
service
these
rooms
shall
then
be
thrown
open
and
my
people
will
be
convinced
of
their
error
good
night
ludovico
let
me
see
you
early
in
the
morning
and
remember
what
i
lately
said
to
youâ€
â€œi
will
my
lord
good
night
to
your
excellenza
let
me
attend
you
with
the
lightâ€
he
lighted
the
count
and
henri
through
the
chambers
to
the
outer
door
on
the
landing-place
stood
a
lamp
which
one
of
the
affrighted
servants
had
left
and
henri
as
he
took
it
up
again
bade
ludovico
good
night
who
having
respectfully
returned
the
wish
closed
the
door
upon
them
and
fastened
it
then
as
he
retired
to
the
bed-chamber
he
examined
the
rooms
through
which
he
passed
with
more
minuteness
than
he
had
done
before
for
he
apprehended
that
some
person
might
have
concealed
himself
in
them
for
the
purpose
of
frightening
him
no
one
however
but
himself
was
in
these
chambers
and
leaving
open
the
doors
through
which
he
passed
he
came
again
to
the
great
drawing-room
whose
spaciousness
and
silent
gloom
somewhat
awed
him
for
a
moment
he
stood
looking
back
through
the
long
suite
of
rooms
he
had
quitted
and
as
he
turned
perceiving
a
light
and
his
own
figure
reflected
in
one
of
the
large
mirrors
he
started
other
objects
too
were
seen
obscurely
on
its
dark
surface
but
he
paused
not
to
examine
them
and
returned
hastily
into
the
bedroom
as
he
surveyed
which
he
observed
the
door
of
the
oriel
and
opened
it
all
within
was
still
on
looking
round
his
eye
was
arrested
by
the
portrait
of
the
deceased
marchioness
upon
which
he
gazed
for
a
considerable
time
with
great
attention
and
some
surprise
and
then
having
examined
the
closet
he
returned
into
the
bedroom
where
he
kindled
a
wood
fire
the
bright
blaze
of
which
revived
his
spirits
which
had
begun
to
yield
to
the
gloom
and
silence
of
the
place
for
gusts
of
wind
alone
broke
at
intervals
this
silence
he
now
drew
a
small
table
and
a
chair
near
the
fire
took
a
bottle
of
wine
and
some
cold
provision
out
of
his
basket
and
regaled
himself
when
he
had
finished
his
repast
he
laid
his
sword
upon
the
table
and
not
feeling
disposed
to
sleep
drew
from
his
pocket
the
book
he
had
spoken
ofâ€”it
was
a
volume
of
old
provenã§al
tales
having
stirred
the
fire
into
a
brighter
blaze
he
began
to
read
and
his
attention
was
soon
wholly
occupied
by
the
scenes
which
the
page
disclosed
the
count
meanwhile
had
returned
to
the
supper-room
whither
those
of
the
party
who
had
attended
him
to
the
north
apartment
had
retreated
upon
hearing
dorothã©eâ€™s
scream
and
who
were
now
earnest
in
their
enquiries
concerning
those
chambers
the
count
rallied
his
guests
on
their
precipitate
retreat
and
on
the
superstitious
inclination
which
had
occasioned
it
and
this
led
to
the
question
whether
the
spirit
after
it
has

ever
permitted
to
revisit
the
earth
and
if
it
is
whether
it
was
possible
for
spirits
to
become
visible
to
the
sense
the
baron
was
of
opinion
that
the
first
was
probable
and
the
last
was
possible
and
he
endeavoured
to
justify
this
opinion
by
respectable
authorities
both
ancient
and
modern
which
he
quoted
the
count
however
was
decidedly
against
him
and
a
long
conversation
ensued
in
which
the
usual
arguments
on
these
subjects
were
on
both
sides
brought
forward
with
skill
and
discussed
with
candour
but
without
converting
either
party
to
the
opinion
of
his
opponent
the
effect
of
their
conversation
on
their
auditors
was
various
though
the
count
had
much
the
superiority
of
the
baron
in
point
of
argument
he
had
considerably
fewer
adherents
for
that
love
so
natural
to
the
human
mind
of
whatever
is
able
to
distend
its
faculties
with
wonder
and
astonishment
attached
the
majority
of
the
company
to
the
side
of
the
baron
and
though
many
of
the
countâ€™s
propositions
were
unanswerable
his
opponents
were
inclined
to
believe
this
the
consequence
of
their
own
want
of
knowledge
on
so
abstracted
a
subject
rather
than
that
arguments
did
not
exist
which
were
forcible
enough
to
conquer
his
blanche
was
pale
with
attention
till
the
ridicule
in
her
fatherâ€™s
glance
called
a
blush
upon
her
countenance
and
she
then
endeavoured
to
forget
the
superstitious
tales
she
had
been
told
in
her
convent
meanwhile
emily
had
been
listening
with
deep
attention
to
the
discussion
of
what
was
to
her
a
very
interesting
question
and
remembering
the
appearance
she
had
witnessed
in
the
apartment
of
the
late
marchioness
she
was
frequently
chilled
with
awe
several
times
she
was
on
the
point
of
mentioning
what
she
had
seen
but
the
fear
of
giving
pain
to
the
count
and
the
dread
of
his
ridicule
restrained
her
and
awaiting
in
anxious
expectation
the
event
of
ludovicoâ€™s
intrepidity
she
determined
that
her
future
silence
should
depend
upon
it
when
the
party
had
separated
for
the
night
and
the
count
retired
to
his
dressing-room
the
remembrance
of
the
desolate
scenes
he
had
lately
witnessed
in
his
own
mansion
deeply
affected
him
but
at
length
he
was
aroused
from
his
reverie
and
his
silence
â€œwhat
music
is
that
i
hearâ€
said
he
suddenly
to
his
valet
â€œwho
plays
at
this
late
hourâ€
the
man
made
no
reply
and
the
count
continued
to
listen
and
then
added
â€œthat
is
no
common
musician
he
touches
the
instrument
with
a
delicate
hand
who
is
it
pierreâ€
â€œmy
lordâ€
said
the
man
hesitatingly
â€œwho
plays
that
instrumentâ€
repeated
the
count
â€œdoes
not
your
lordship
know
thenâ€
said
the
valet
â€œwhat
mean
youâ€
said
the
count
somewhat
sternly
â€œnothing
my
lord
i
meant
nothingâ€
rejoined
the
man
submissivelyâ€”â€œonlyâ€”that
musicâ€”goes
about
the
house
at
midnight
often
and
i
thought
your
lordship
might
have
heard
it
beforeâ€
â€œmusic
goes
about
the
house
at
midnight
poor
fellowâ€”does
nobody
dance
to
the
music
tooâ€
â€œit
is
not
in
the
chã¢teau
i
believe
my
lord
the
sounds
come
from
the
woods
they
say
though
they
seem
so
nearâ€”but
then
a
spirit
can
do
anythingâ€
â€œah
poor
fellowâ€
said
the
count
â€œi
perceive
you
are
as
silly
as
the
rest
of
them
tomorrow
you
will
be
convinced
of
your
ridiculous
error
but
harkâ€”what
voice
is
thatâ€
â€œo
my
lord
that
is
the
voice
we
often
hear
with
the
musicâ€
â€œoftenâ€
said
the
count
â€œhow
often
pray
it
is
a
very
fine
oneâ€
â€œwhy
my
lord
i
myself
have
not
heard
it
more
than
two
or
three
times
but
there
are
those
who
have
lived
here
longer
that
have
heard
it
often
enoughâ€
â€œwhat
a
swell
was
thatâ€
exclaimed
the
count
as
he
still
listened
â€œand
now
what
a
dying
cadence
this
is
surely
something
more
than
mortalâ€
â€œthat
is
what
they
say
my
lordâ€
said
the
valet
â€œthey
say
it
is
nothing
mortal
that
utters
it
and
if
i
might
say
my
thoughtsâ€”â€
â€œpeaceâ€
said
the
count
and
he
listened
till
the
strain
died
away
â€œthis
is
strangeâ€
said
he
as
he
turned
from
the
window
â€œclose
the
casements
pierreâ€
pierre
obeyed
and
the
count
soon
after
dismissed
him
but
did
not
so
soon
lose
the
remembrance
of
the
music
which
long
vibrated
in
his
fancy
in
tones
of
melting
sweetness
while
surprise
and
perplexity
engaged
his
thoughts
ludovico
meanwhile
in
his
remote
chamber
heard
now
and
then
the
faint
echo
of
a
closing
door
as
the
family
retired
to
rest
and
then
the
hall
clock
at
a
great
distance
strike
twelve
â€œit
is
midnightâ€
said
he
and
he
looked
suspiciously
round
the
spacious
chamber
the
fire
on
the
hearth
was
now
nearly
expiring
for
his
attention
having
been
engaged
by
the
book
before
him
he
had
forgotten
everything
besides
but
he
soon
added
fresh
wood
not
because
he
was
cold
though
the
night
was
stormy
but
because
he
was
cheerless
and
having
again
trimmed
his
lamp
he
poured
out
a
glass
of
wine
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
the
crackling
blaze
tried
to
be
deaf
to
the
wind
that
howled
mournfully
at
the
casements
endeavoured
to
abstract
his
mind
from
the
melancholy
that
was
stealing
upon
him
and
again
took
up
his
book
it
had
been
lent
to
him
by
dorothã©e
who
had
formerly
picked
it
up
in
an
obscure
corner
of
the
marquisâ€™s
library
and
who
having
opened
it
and
perceived
some
of
the
marvels
it
related
had
carefully
preserved
it
for
her
own
entertainment
its
condition
giving
her
some
excuse
for
detaining
it
from
its
proper
station
the
damp
corner
into
which
it
had
fallen
had
caused
the
cover
to
be
disfigured
and
mouldy
and
the
leaves
to
be
so
discoloured
with
spots
that
it
was
not
without
difficulty
the
letters
could
be
traced
the
fictions
of
the
provenã§al
writers
whether
drawn
from
the
arabian
legends
brought
by
the
saracens
into
spain
or
recounting
the
chivalric
exploits
performed
by
the
crusaders
whom
the
troubadors
accompanied
to
the
east
were
generally
splendid
and
always
marvellous
both
in
scenery
and
incident
and
it
is
not
wonderful
that
dorothã©e
and
ludovico
should
be
fascinated
by
inventions
which
had
captivated
the
careless
imagination
in
every
rank
of
society
in
a
former
age
some
of
the
tales
however
in
the
book
now
before
ludovico
were
of
simple
structure
and
exhibited
nothing
of
the
magnificent
machinery
and
heroic
manners
which
usually
characterised
the
fables
of
the
twelfth
century
and
of
this
description
was
the
one
he
now
happened
to
open
which
in
its
original
style
was
of
great
length
but
which
may
be
thus
shortly
related
the
reader
will
perceive
that
it
is
strongly
tinctured
with
the
superstition
of
the
times
the
provenã‡al
tale
â€œthere
lived
in
the
province
of
bretagne
a
noble
baron
famous
for
his
magnificence
and
courtly
hospitalities
his
castle
was
graced
with
ladies
of
exquisite
beauty
and
thronged
with
illustrious
knights
for
the
honour
he
paid
to
feats
of
chivalry
invited
the
brave
of
distant
countries
to
enter
his
lists
and
his
court
was
more
splendid
than
those
of
many
princes
eight
minstrels
were
retained
in
his
service
who
used
to
sing
to
their
harps
romantic
fictions
taken
from
the
arabians
or
adventures
of
chivalry
that
befel
knights
during
the
crusades
or
the
martial
deeds
of
the
baron
their
lordâ€”while
he
surrounded
by
his
knights
and
ladies
banqueted
in
the
great
hall
of
his
castle
where
the
costly
tapestry
that
adorned
the
walls
with
pictured
exploits
of
his
ancestors
the
casements
of
painted
glass
enriched
with
armorial
bearings
the
gorgeous
banners
that
waved
along
the
roof
the
sumptuous
canopies
the
profusion
of
gold
and
silver
that
glittered
on
the
sideboards
the
numerous
dishes
that
covered
the
tables
the
number
and
gay
liveries
of
the
attendants
with
the
chivalric
and
splendid
attire
of
the
guests
united
to
form
a
scene
of
magnificence
such
as
we
may
not
hope
to
see
in
these
degenerate
days
â€œof
the
baron
the
following
adventure
is
related
one
night
having
retired
late
from
the
banquet
to
his
chamber
and
dismissed
his
attendants
he
was
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
a
stranger
of
a
noble
air
but
of
a
sorrowful
and
dejected
countenance
believing
that
this
person
had
been
secreted
in
the
apartment
since
it
appeared
impossible
he
could
have
lately
passed
the
ante-room
unobserved
by
the
pages
in
waiting
who
would
have
prevented
this
intrusion
on
their
lord
the
baron
calling
loudly
for
his
people
drew
his
sword
which
he
had
not
yet
taken
from
his
side
and
stood
upon
his
defence
the
stranger
slowly
advancing
told
him
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
that
he
came
with
no
hostile
design
but
to
communicate
to
him
a
terrible
secret
which
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
know
â€œthe
baron
appeased
by
the
courteous
manners
of
the
stranger
after
surveying
him
for
some
time
in
silence
returned
his
sword
into
the
scabbard
and
desired
him
to
explain
the
means
by
which
he
had
obtained
access
to
the
chamber
and
the
purpose
of
this
extraordinary
visit
â€œwithout
answering
either
of
these
enquiries
the
stranger
said
that
he
could
not
then
explain
himself
but
that
if
the
baron
would
follow
him
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
at
a
short
distance
from
the
castle
walls
he
would
there
convince
him
that
he
had
something
of
importance
to
disclose
â€œthis
proposal
again
alarmed
the
baron
who
could
scarcely
believe
that
the
stranger
meant
to
draw
him
to
so
solitary
a
spot
at
this
hour
of
the
night
without
harbouring
a
design
against
his
life
and
he
refused
to
go
observing
at
the
same
time
that
if
the
strangerâ€™s
purpose
was
an
honourable
one
he
would
not
persist
in
refusing
to
reveal
the
occasion
of
his
visit
in
the
apartment
where
they
were
â€œwhile
he
spoke
this
he
viewed
the
stranger
still
more
attentively
than
before
but
observed
no
change
in
his
countenance
or
any
symptom
that
might
intimate
a
consciousness
of
evil
design
he
was
habited
like
a
knight
was
of
a
tall
and
majestic
stature
and
of
dignified
and
courteous
manners
still
however
he
refused
to
communicate
the
subject
of
his
errand
in
any
place
but
that
he
had
mentioned
and
at
the
same
time
gave
hints
concerning
the
secret
he
would
disclose
that
awakened
a
degree
of
solemn
curiosity
in
the
baron
which
at
length
induced
him
to
consent
to
follow
the
stranger
on
certain
conditions
â€œâ€˜sir
knightâ€™
said
he
â€˜i
will
attend
you
to
the
forest
and
will
take
with
me
only
four
of
my
people
who
shall
witness
our
conferenceâ€™
â€œto
this
however
the
knight
objected
â€œâ€˜what
i
would
discloseâ€™
said
he
with
solemnity
â€˜is
to
you
alone
there
are
only
three
living
persons
to
whom
the
circumstance
is
known
it
is
of
more
consequence
to
you
and
your
house
than
i
shall
now
explain
in
future
years
you
will
look
back
to
this
night
with
satisfaction
or
repentance
accordingly
as
you
now
determine
as
you
would
hereafter
prosperâ€”follow
me
i
pledge
you
the
honour
of
a
knight
that
no
evil
shall
befall
youâ€”if
you
are
contented
to
dare
futurityâ€”remain
in
your
chamber
and
i
will
depart
as
i
cameâ€™
â€œâ€˜sir
knightâ€™
replied
the
baron
â€˜how
is
it
possible
that
my
future
peace
can
depend
upon
my
present
determinationâ€™
â€œâ€˜that
is
not
now
to
be
toldâ€™
said
the
stranger
â€˜i
have
explained
myself
to
the
utmost
it
is
late
if
you
follow
me
it
must
be
quicklyâ€”you
will
do
well
to
consider
the
alternativeâ€™
â€œthe
baron
mused
and
as
he
looked
upon
the
knight
he
perceived
his
countenance
assume
a
singular
solemnityâ€
here
ludovico
thought
he
heard
a
noise
and
he
threw
a
glance
round
the
chamber
and
then
held
up
the
lamp
to
assist
his
observation
but
not
perceiving
anything
to
confirm
his
alarm
he
took
up
the
book
again
and
pursued
the
story
â€œthe
baron
paced
his
apartment
for
some
time
in
silence
impressed
by
the
last
words
of
the
stranger
whose
extraordinary
request
he
feared
to
grant
and
feared
also
to
refuse
at
length
he
said
â€˜sir
knight
you
are
utterly
unknown
to
me
tell
me
yourselfâ€”is
it
reasonable
that
i
should
trust
myself
alone
with
a
stranger
at
this
hour
in
a
solitary
forest
tell
me
at
least
who
you
are
and
who
assisted
to
secrete
you
in
this
chamberâ€™
â€œthe
knight
frowned
at
these
latter
words
and
was
a
moment
silent
then
with
a
countenance
somewhat
stern
he
said
â€œâ€˜i
am
an
english
knight
i
am
called
sir
bevys
of
lancasterâ€”and
my
deeds
are
not
unknown
at
the
holy
city
whence
i
was
returning
to
my
native
land
when
i
was
benighted
in
the
neighbouring
forestâ€™
â€œâ€˜your
name
is
not
unknown
to
fameâ€™
said
the
baron
â€˜i
have
heard
of
itâ€™
the
knight
looked
haughtily
â€˜but
why
since
my
castle
is
known
to
entertain
all
true
knights
did
not
your
herald
announce
you
why
did
you
not
appear
at
the
banquet
where
your
presence
would
have
been
welcomed
instead
of
hiding
yourself
in
my
castle
and
stealing
to
my
chamber
at
midnightâ€™
â€œthe
stranger
frowned
and
turned
away
in
silence
but
the
baron
repeated
the
questions
â€œâ€˜i
come
notâ€™
said
the
knight
â€˜to
answer
enquiries
but
to
reveal
facts
if
you
would
know
more
follow
me
and
again
i
pledge
the
honour
of
a
knight
that
you
shall
return
in
safetyâ€”be
quick
in
your
determinationâ€”i
must
be
goneâ€™
â€œafter
some
further
hesitation
the
baron
determined
to
follow
the
stranger
and
to
see
the
result
of
his
extraordinary
request
he
therefore
again
drew
forth
his
sword
and
taking
up
a
lamp
bade
the
knight
lead
on
the
latter
obeyed
and
opening
the
door
of
the
chamber
they
passed
into
the
ante-room
where
the
baron
surprised
to
find
all
his
pages
asleep
stopped
and
with
hasty
violence
was
going
to
reprimand
them
for
their
carelessness
when
the
knight
waved
his
hand
and
looked
so
expressively
upon
the
baron
that
the
latter
restrained
his
resentment
and
passed
on
â€œthe
knight
having
descended
a
staircase
opened
a
secret
door
which
the
baron
had
believed
was
known
only
to
himself
and
proceeding
through
several
narrow
and
winding
passages
came
at
length
to
a
small
gate
that
opened
beyond
the
walls
of
the
castle
meanwhile
the
baron
followed
in
silence
and
amazement
on
perceiving
that
these
secret
passages
were
so
well
known
to
a
stranger
and
felt
inclined
to
return
from
an
adventure
that
appeared
to
partake
of
treachery
as
well
as
danger
then
considering
that
he
was
armed
and
observing
the
courteous
and
noble
air
of
his
conductor
his
courage
returned
he
blushed
that
it
had
failed
him
for
a
moment
and
he
resolved
to
trace
the
mystery
to
its
source
â€œhe
now
found
himself
on
the
heathy
platform
before
the
great
gates
of
his
castle
where
on
looking
up
he
perceived
lights
glimmering
in
the
different
casements
of
the
guests
who
were
retiring
to
sleep
and
while
he
shivered
in
the
blast
and
looked
on
the
dark
and
desolate
scene
around
him
he
thought
of
the
comforts
of
his
warm
chamber
rendered
cheerful
by
the
blaze
of
wood
and
felt
for
a
moment
the
full
contrast
of
his
present
situationâ€
here
ludovico
paused
a
moment
and
looking
at
his
own
fire
gave
it
a
brightening
stir
â€œthe
wind
was
strong
and
the
baron
watched
his
lamp
with
anxiety
expecting
every
moment
to
see
it
extinguished
but
though
the
flame
wavered
it
did
not
expire
and
he
still
followed
the
stranger
who
often
sighed
as
he
went
but
did
not
speak
â€œwhen
they
reached
the
borders
of
the
forest
the
knight
turned
and
raised
his
head
as
if
he
meant
to
address
the
baron
but
then
closing
his
lips
in
silence
he
walked
on
â€œas
they
entered
beneath
the
dark
and
spreading
boughs
the
baron
affected
by
the
solemnity
of
the
scene
hesitated
whether
to
proceed
and
demanded
how
much
further
they
were
to
go
the
knight
replied
only
by
a
gesture
and
the
baron
with
hesitating
steps
and
a
suspicious
eye
followed
through
an
obscure
and
intricate
path
till
having
proceeded
a
considerable
way
he
again
demanded
whither
they
were
going
and
refused
to
proceed
unless
he
was
informed
â€œas
he
said
this
he
looked
at
his
own
sword
and
at
the
knight
alternately
who
shook
his
head
and
whose
dejected
countenance
disarmed
the
baron
for
a
moment
of
suspicion
â€œâ€˜a
little
further
is
the
place
whither
i
would
lead
youâ€™
said
the
stranger
â€˜no
evil
shall
befall
youâ€”i
have
sworn
it
on
the
honour
of
a
knightâ€™
â€œthe
baron
reassured
again
followed
in
silence
and
they
soon
arrived
at
a
deep
recess
of
the
forest
where
the
dark
and
lofty
chesnuts
entirely
excluded
the
sky
and
which
was
so
overgrown
with
underwood
that
they
proceeded
with
difficulty
the
knight
sighed
deeply
as
he
passed
and
sometimes
paused
and
having
at
length
reached
a
spot
where
the
trees
crowded
into
a
knot
he
turned
and
with
a
terrific
look
pointing
to
the
ground
the
baron
saw
there
the
body
of
a
man
stretched
at
its
length
and
weltering
in
blood
a
ghastly
wound
was
on
the
forehead
and
death
appeared
already
to
have
contracted
the
features
â€œthe
baron
on
perceiving
the
spectacle
started
in
horror
looked
at
the
knight
for
explanation
and
was
then
going
to
raise
the
body
and
examine
if
there
were
yet
any
remains
of
life
but
the
stranger
waving
his
hand
fixed
upon
him
a
look
so
earnest
and
mournful
as
not
only
much
surprised
him
but
made
him
desist
â€œbut
what
were
the
baronâ€™s
emotions
when
on
holding
the
lamp
near
the
features
of
the
corpse
he
discovered
the
exact
resemblance
of
the
stranger
his
conductor
to
whom
he
now
looked
up
in
astonishment
and
enquiry
as
he
gazed
he
perceived
the
countenance
of
the
knight
change
and
begin
to
fade
till
his
whole
form
gradually
vanished
from
his
astonished
sense
while
the
baron
stood
fixed
to
the
spot
a
voice
was
heard
to
utter
these
wordsâ€”â€
ludovico
started
and
laid
down
the
book
for
he
thought
he
heard
a
voice
in
the
chamber
and
he
looked
toward
the
bed
where
however
he
saw
only
the
dark
curtains
and
the
pall
he
listened
scarcely
daring
to
draw
his
breath
but
heard
only
the
distant
roaring
of
the
sea
in
the
storm
and
the
blast
that
rushed
by
the
casements
when
concluding
that
he
had
been
deceived
by
its
sighings
he
took
up
his
book
to
finish
the
story
â€œwhile
the
baron
stood
fixed
to
the
spot
a
voice
was
heard
to
utter
these
wordsâ€”

he
recovered
from
the

and
astonishment
into
which
this
adventure
had
thrown
him
returned
to

he
caused

ludovico
having
finished
this
story
laid
aside
the
book
for
he
felt
drowsy
and
after
putting
more
wood
on
the
fire
and
taking
another
glass
of
wine
he
reposed
himself
in
the
arm-chair
on
the
hearth
in
his
dream
he
still
beheld
the
chamber
where
he
really
was
and
once
or
twice
started
from
imperfect
slumbers
imagining
he
saw
a
manâ€™s
face
looking
over
the
high
back
of
his
arm-chair
this
idea
had
so
strongly
impressed
him
that
when
he
raised
his
eyes
he
almost
expected
to
meet
other
eyes
fixed
upon
his
own
and
he
quitted
his
seat
and
looked
behind
the
chair
before
he
felt
perfectly
convinced
that
no
person
was
there

shakespeare
the
count
who
had
slept
little
during
the
night
rose
early
and
anxious
to
speak
with
ludovico
went
to
the
north
apartment
but
the
outer
door
having
been
fastened
on
the
preceding
night
he
was
obliged
to
knock
loudly
for
admittance
neither
the
knocking
nor
his
voice
was
heard
but
considering
the
distance
of
this
door
from
the
bedroom
and
that
ludovico
wearied
with
watching
had
probably
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep
the
count
was
not
surprised
on
receiving
no
answer
and
leaving
the
door
he
went
down
to
walk
in
his
grounds
it
was
a
grey
autumnal
morning
the
sun
rising
over
provence
gave
only
a
feeble
light
as
his
rays
struggled
through
the
vapours
that
ascended
from
the
sea
and
floated
heavily
over
the
wood-tops
which
were
now
varied
with
many
a
mellow
tint
of
autumn
the
storm
was
passed
but
the
waves
were
yet
violently
agitated
and
their
course
was
traced
by
long
lines
of
foam
while
not
a
breeze
fluttered
in
the
sails
of
the
vessels
near
the
shore
that
were
weighing
anchor
to
depart
the
still
gloom
of
the
hour
was
pleasing
to
the
count
and
he
pursued
his
way
through
the
woods
sunk
in
deep
thought
emily
also
rose
at
an
early
hour
and
took
her
customary
walk
along
the
brow
of
the
promontory
that
overhung
the
mediterranean
her
mind
was
now
not
occupied
with
the
occurrences
of
the
chã¢teau
and
valancourt
was
the
subject
of
her
mournful
thoughts
whom
she
had
not
yet
taught
herself
to
consider
with
indifference
though
her
judgment
constantly
reproached
her
for
the
affection
that
lingered
in
her
heart
after
her
esteem
for
him
was
departed
remembrance
frequently
gave
her
his
parting
look
and
the
tones
of
his
voice
when
he
had
bade
her
a
last
farewell
and
some
accidental
associations
now
recalling
these
circumstances
to
her
fancy
with
peculiar
energy
she
shed
bitter
tears
to
the
recollection
having
reached
the
watch-tower
she
seated
herself
on
the
broken
steps
and
in
melancholy
dejection
watched
the
waves
half
hid
in
vapour
as
they
came
rolling
towards
the
shore
and
threw
up
their
light
spray
round
the
rocks
below
their
hollow
murmur
and
the
obscuring
mists
that
came
in
wreaths
up
the
cliffs
gave
a
solemnity
to
the
scene
which
was
in
harmony
with
the
temper
of
her
mind
and
she
sat
given
up
to
the
remembrance
of
past
times
till
this
became
too
painful
and
she
abruptly
quitted
the
place
on
passing
the
little
gate
of
the
watch-tower
she
observed
letters
engraved
on
the
stone
postern
which
she
paused
to
examine
and
though
they
appeared
to
have
been
rudely
cut
with
a
pen-knife
the
characters
were
familiar
to
her
at
length
recognising
the
hand-writing
of
valancourt
she
read
with
trembling
anxiety
the
following
lines
entitled
shipwreck
â€™til
solemn
midnight
on
this
lonely
steep
beneath
this
watch-towâ€™râ€™s
desolated
wall
where
mystic
shapes
the
wonderer
appall
i
rest
and
view
below
the
desert
deep
as
through
tempestuous
clouds
the
moonâ€™s
cold
light
gleams
on
the
wave
viewless
the
winds
of
night
with
loud
mysterious
force
the
billows
sweep
and
sullen
roar
the
surges
far
below
in
the
still
pauses
of
the
gust
i
hear
the
voice
of
spirits
rising
sweet
and
slow
and
oft
among
the
clouds
their
forms
appear
but
hark
what
shriek
of
death
comes
in
the
gale
and
in
the
distant
ray
what
glimmering
sail
bends
to
the
stormâ€”now
sinks
the
note
of
fear
ah
wretched
marinersâ€”no
more
shall
day
unclose
his
cheering
eye
to
light
ye
on
your
way
from
these
lines
it
appeared
that
valancourt
had
visited
the
tower
that
he
had
probably
been
here
on
the
preceding
night
for
it
was
such
a
one
as
they
described
and
that
he
had
left
the
building
very
lately
since
it
had
not
long
been
light
and
without
light
it
was
impossible
these
letters
could
have
been
cut
it
was
thus
even
probable
that
he
might
be
yet
in
the
gardens
as
these
reflections
passed
rapidly
over
the
mind
of
emily
they
called
up
a
variety
of
contending
emotions
that
almost
overcame
her
spirits
but
her
first
impulse
was
to
avoid
him
and
immediately
leaving
the
tower
she
returned
with
hasty
steps
towards
the
chã¢teau
as
she
passed
along
she
remembered
the
music
she
had
lately
heard
near
the
tower
with
the
figure
which
had
appeared
and
in
this
moment
of
agitation
she
was
inclined
to
believe
that
she
had
then
heard
and
seen
valancourt
but
other
recollections
soon
convinced
her
of
her
error
on
turning
into
a
thicker
part
of
the
woods
she
perceived
a
person
walking
slowly
in
the
gloom
at
some
little
distance
and
her
mind
engaged
by
the
idea
of
him
she
started
and
paused
imagining
this
to
be
valancourt
the
person
advanced
with
quicker
steps
and
before
she
could
recover
recollection
enough
to
avoid
him
he
spoke
and
she
then
knew
the
voice
of
the
count
who
expressed
some
surprise
on
finding
her
walking
at
so
early
an
hour
and
made
a
feeble
effort
to
rally
her
on
her
love
of
solitude
but
he
soon
perceived
this
to
be
more
a
subject
of
concern
than
of
light
laughter
and
changing
his
manner
affectionately
expostulated
with
emily
on
thus
indulging
unavailing
regret
who
though
she
acknowledged
the
justness
of
all
he
said
could
not
restrain
her
tears
while
she
did
so
and
he
presently
quitted
the
topic
expressing
surprise
at
not
having
yet
heard
from
his
friend
the
advocate
at
avignon
in
answer
to
the
questions
proposed
to
him
respecting
the
estates
of
the
late
madame
montoni
he
with
friendly
zeal
endeavoured
to
cheer
emily
with
hopes
of
establishing
her
claim
to
them
while
she
felt
that
the
estates
could
now
contribute
little
to
the
happiness
of
a
life
in
which
valancourt
had
no
longer
an
interest
when
they
returned
to
the
chã¢teau
emily
retired
to
her
apartment
and
count
de
villefort
to
the
door
of
the
north
chambers
this
was
still
fastened
but
being
now
determined
to
arouse
ludovico
he
renewed
his
calls
more
loudly
than
before
after
which
a
total
silence
ensued
and
the
count
finding
all
his
efforts
to
be
heard
ineffectual
at
length
began
to
fear
that
some
accident
had
befallen
ludovico
whom
terror
of
an
imaginary
being
might
have
deprived
of
his
senses
he
therefore
left
the
door
with
an
intention
of
summoning
his
servants
to
force
it
open
some
of
whom
he
now
heard
moving
in
the
lower
part
of
the
chã¢teau
to
the
countâ€™s
enquiries
whether
they
had
seen
or
heard
ludovico
they
replied
in
affright
that
not
one
of
them
had
ventured
on
the
north
side
of
the
chã¢teau
since
the
preceding
night
â€œhe
sleeps
soundly
thenâ€
said
the
count
â€œand
is
at
such
a
distance
from
the
outer
door
which
is
fastened
that
to
gain
admittance
to
the
chambers
it
will
be
necessary
to
force
it
bring
an
instrument
and
follow
meâ€
the
servants
stood
mute
and
dejected
and
it
was
not
till
nearly
all
the
household
were
assembled
that
the
countâ€™s
orders
were
obeyed
in
the
mean
time
dorothã©e
was
telling
of
a
door
that
opened
from
a
gallery
leading
from
the
great
staircase
into
the
last
ante-room
of
the
saloon
and
this
being
much
nearer
to
the
bed-chamber
it
appeared
probable
that
ludovico
might
be
easily
awakened
by
an
attempt
to
open
it
thither
therefore
the
count
went
but
his
voice
was
as
ineffectual
at
this
door
as
it
had
proved
at
the
remoter
one
and
now
seriously
interested
for
ludovico
he
was
himself
going
to
strike
upon
the
door
with
the
instrument
when
he
observed
its
singular
beauty
and
withheld
the
blow
it
appeared
on
the
first
glance
to
be
of
ebony
so
dark
and
close
was
its
grain
and
so
high
its
polish
but
it
proved
to
be
only
of
larch
wood
of
the
growth
of
provence
then
famous
for
its
forests
of
larch
the
beauty
of
its
polished
hue
and
of
its
delicate
carvings
determined
the
count
to
spare
this
door
and
he
returned
to
that
leading
from
the
back
staircase
which
being
at
length
forced
he
entered
the
first
ante-room
followed
by
henri
and
a
few
of
the
most
courageous
of
his
servants
the
rest
awaiting
the
event
of
the
enquiry
on
the
stairs
and
landing-place
all
was
silent
in
the
chambers
through
which
the
count
passed
and
having
reached
the
saloon
he
called
loudly
upon
ludovico
after
which
still
receiving
no
answer
he
threw
open
the
door
of
the
bedroom
and
entered
the
profound
stillness
within
confirmed
his
apprehensions
for
ludovico
for
not
even
the
breathings
of
a
person
in
sleep
were
heard
and
his
uncertainty
was
not
soon
terminated
since
the
shutters
being
all
closed
the
chamber
was
too
dark
for
any
object
to
be
distinguished
in
it
the
count
bade
a
servant
open
them
who
as
he
crossed
the
room
to
do
so
stumbled
over
something
and
fell
to
the
floor
when
his
cry
occasioned
such
panic
among
the
few
of
his
fellows
who
had
ventured
thus
far
that
they
instantly
fled
and
the
count
and
henri
were
left
to
finish
the
adventure
henri
then
sprung
across
the
room
and
opening
a
window-shutter
they
perceived
that
the
man
had
fallen
over
a
chair
near
the
hearth
in
which
ludovico
had
been
sittingâ€”for
he
sat
there
no
longer
nor
could
anywhere
be
seen
by
the
imperfect
light
that
was
admitted
into
the
apartment
the
count
seriously
alarmed
now
opened
other
shutters
that
he
might
be
enabled
to
examine
further
and
ludovico
not
yet
appearing
he
stood
for
a
moment
suspended
in
astonishment
and
scarcely
trusting
his
senses
till
his
eyes
glancing
on
the
bed
he
advanced
to
examine
whether
he
was
there
asleep
no
person
however
was
in
it
and
he
proceeded
to
the
oriel
where
everything
remained
as
on
the
preceding
night
but
ludovico
was
nowhere
to
be
found
the
count
now
checked
his
amazement
considering
that
ludovico
might
have
left
the
chambers
during
the
night
overcome
by
the
terrors
which
their
lonely
desolation
and
the
recollected
reports
concerning
them
had
inspired
yet
if
this
had
been
the
fact
the
man
would
naturally
have
sought
society
and
his
fellow
servants
had
all
declared
they
had
not
seen
him
the
door
of
the
outer
room
also
had
been
found
fastened
with
the
key
on
the
inside
it
was
impossible
therefore
for
him
to
have
passed
through
that
and
all
the
outer
doors
of
this
suite
were
found
on
examination
to
be
bolted
and
locked
with
the
keys
also
within
them
the
count
being
then
compelled
to
believe
that
the
lad
had
escaped
through
the
casements
next
examined
them
but
such
as
opened
wide
enough
to
admit
the
body
of
a
man
were
found
to
be
carefully
secured
either
by
iron
bars
or
by
shutters
and
no
vestige
appeared
of
any
person
having
attempted
to
pass
them
neither
was
it
probable
that
ludovico
would
have
incurred
the
risk
of
breaking
his
neck
by
leaping
from
a
window
when
he
might
have
walked
safely
through
a
door
the
countâ€™s
amazement
did
not
admit
of
words
but
he
returned
once
more
to
examine
the
bedroom
where
was
no
appearance
of
disorder
except
that
occasioned
by
the
late
overthrow
of
the
chair
near
which
had
stood
a
small
table
and
on
this
ludovicoâ€™s
sword
his
lamp
the
book
he
had
been
reading
and
the
remnant
of
his
flask
of
wine
still
remained
at
the
foot
of
the
table
too
was
the
basket
with
some
fragments
of
provision
and
wood
henri
and
the
servant
now
uttered
their
astonishment
without
reserve
and
though
the
count
said
little
there
was
a
seriousness
in
his
manner
that
expressed
much
it
appeared
that
ludovico
must
have
quitted
these
rooms
by
some
concealed
passage
for
the
count
could
not
believe
that
any
supernatural
means
had
occasioned
this
event
yet
if
there
was
any
such
passage
it
seemed
inexplicable
why
he
should
retreat
through
it
and
it
was
equally
surprising
that
not
even
the
smallest
vestige
should
appear
by
which
his
progress
could
be
traced
in
the
rooms
everything
remained
as
much
in
order
as
if
he
had
just
walked
out
by
the
common
way
the
count
himself
assisted
in
lifting
the
arras
with
which
the
bed-chamber
saloon
and
one
of
the
ante-rooms
were
hung
that
he
might
discover
if
any
door
had
been
concealed
behind
it
but
after
a
laborious
search
none
was
found
and
he
at
length
quitted
the
apartments
having
secured
the
door
of
the
last
ante-chamber
the
key
of
which
he
took
into
his
own
possession
he
then
gave
orders
that
strict
search
should
be
made
for
ludovico
not
only
in
the
chã¢teau
but
in
the
neighbourhood
and
retiring
with
henri
to
his
closet
they
remained
there
in
conversation
for
a
considerable
time
and
whatever
was
the
subject
of
it
henri
from
this
hour
lost
much
of
his
vivacity
and
his
manners
were
particularly
grave
and
reserved
whenever
the
topic
which
now
agitated
the
countâ€™s
family
with
wonder
and
alarm
was
introduced
on
the
disappearing
of
ludovico
baron
st
foix
seemed
strengthened
in
all
his
former
opinions
concerning
the
probability
of
apparitions
though
it
was
difficult
to
discover
what
connection
there
could
possibly
be
between
the
two
subjects
or
to
account
for
this
effect
otherwise
than
by
supposing
that
the
mystery
attending
ludovico
by
exciting
awe
and
curiosity
reduced
the
mind
to
a
state
of
sensibility
which
rendered
it
more
liable
to
the
influence
of
superstition
in
general
it
is
however
certain
that
from
this
period
the
baron
and
his
adherents
became
more
bigoted
to
their
own
systems
than
before
while
the
terrors
of
the
countâ€™s
servants
increased
to
an
excess
that
occasioned
many
of
them
to
quit
the
mansion
immediately
and
the
rest
remained
only
till
others
could
be
procured
to
supply
their
places
the
most
strenuous
search
after
ludovico
proved
unsuccessful
and
after
several
days
of
indefatigable
enquiry
poor
annette
gave
herself
up
to
despair
and
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
chã¢teau
to
amazement
emily
whose
mind
had
been
deeply
affected
by
the
disastrous
fate
of
the
late
marchioness
and
with
the
mysterious
connection
which
she
fancied
had
existed
between
her
and
st
aubert
was
particularly
impressed
by
the
late
extraordinary
event
and
much
concerned
for
the
loss
of
ludovico
whose
integrity
and
faithful
services
claimed
both
her
esteem
and
gratitude
she
was
now
very
desirous
to
return
to
the
quiet
retirement
of
her
convent
but
every
hint
of
this
was
received
with
real
sorrow
by
the
lady
blanche
and
affectionately
set
aside
by
the
count
for
whom
she
felt
much
of
the
respectful
love
and
admiration
of
a
daughter
and
to
whom
by
dorothã©eâ€™s
consent
she
at
length
mentioned
the
appearance
which
they
had
witnessed
in
the
chamber
of
the
deceased
marchioness
at
any
other
period
he
would
have
smiled
at
such
a
relation
and
have
believed
that
its
object
had
existed
only
in
the
distempered
fancy
of
the
relater
but
he
now
attended
to
emily
with
seriousness
and
when
she
concluded
requested
of
her
a
promise
that
this
occurrence
should
rest
in
silence
â€œwhatever
may
be
the
cause
and
the
import
of
these
extraordinary
occurrencesâ€
added
the
count
â€œtime
only
can
explain
them
i
shall
keep
a
wary
eye
upon
all
that
passes
in
the
chã¢teau
and
shall
pursue
every
possible
means
of
discovering
the
fate
of
ludovico
meanwhile
we
must
be
prudent
and
be
silent
i
will
myself
watch
in
the
north
chambers
but
of
this
we
will
say
nothing
till
the
night
arrives
when
i
purpose
doing
soâ€
the
count
then
sent
for
dorothã©e
and
required
of
her
also
a
promise
of
silence
concerning
what
she
had
already
or
might
in
future
witness
of
an
extraordinary
nature
and
this
ancient
servant
now
related
to
him
the
particulars
of
the
marchioness
de
villeroiâ€™s
death
with
some
of
which
he
appeared
to
be
already
acquainted
while
by
others
he
was
evidently
surprised
and
agitated
after
listening
to
this
narrative
the
count
retired
to
his
closet
where
he
remained
alone
for
several
hours
and
when
he
again
appeared
the
solemnity
of
his
manner
surprised
and
alarmed
emily
but
she
gave
no
utterance
to
her
thoughts
on
the
week
following
the
disappearance
of
ludovico
all
the
countâ€™s
guests
took
leave
of
him
except
the
baron
his
son
mons
st
foix
and
emily
the
latter
of
whom
was
soon
after
embarrassed
and
distressed
by
the
arrival
of
another
visitor
mons
du
pont
which
made
her
determine
upon
withdrawing
to
her
convent
immediately
the
delight
that
appeared
in
his
countenance
when
he
met
her
told
that
he
brought
back
the
same
ardour
of
passion
which
had
formerly
banished
him
from
chã¢teau-le-blanc
he
was
received
with
reserve
by
emily
and
with
pleasure
by
the
count
who
presented
him
to
her
with
a
smile
that
seemed
intended
to
plead
his
cause
and
who
did
not
hope
the
less
for
his
friend
from
the
embarrassment
she
betrayed
but
m
du
pont
with
truer
sympathy
seemed
to
understand
her
manner
and
his
countenance
quickly
lost
its
vivacity
and
sunk
into
the
languor
of
despondency
on
the
following
day
however
he
sought
an
opportunity
of
declaring
the
purport
of
his
visit
and
renewed
his
suit
a
declaration
which
was
received
with
real
concern
by
emily
who
endeavoured
to
lessen
the
pain
she
might
inflict
by
a
second
rejection
with
assurances
of
esteem
and
friendship
yet
she
left
him
in
a
state
of
mind
that
claimed
and
excited
her
tenderest
compassion
and
being
more
sensible
than
ever
of
the
impropriety
of
remaining
longer
at
the
chã¢teau
she
immediately
sought
the
count
and
communicated
to
him
her
intention
of
returning
to
the
convent
â€œmy
dear
emilyâ€
said
he
â€œi
observe
with
extreme
concern
the
illusion
you
are
encouragingâ€”an
illusion
common
to
young
and
sensible
minds
your
heart
has
received
a
severe
shock
you
believe
you
can
never
entirely
recover
it
and
you
will
encourage
this
belief
till
the
habit
of
indulging
sorrow
will
subdue
the
strength
of
your
mind
and
discolour
your
future
views
with
melancholy
and
regret
let
me
dissipate
this
illusion
and
awaken
you
to
a
sense
of
your
dangerâ€
emily
smiled
mournfully
â€œi
know
what
you
would
say
my
dear
sirâ€
said
she
â€œand
am
prepared
to
answer
you
i
feel
that
my
heart
can
never
know
a
second
affection
and
that
i
must
never
hope
even
to
recover
its
tranquillityâ€”if
i
suffer
myself
to
enter
into
a
second
engagementâ€
â€œi
know
that
you
feel
all
thisâ€
replied
the
count
â€œand
i
know
also
that
time
will
overcome
these
feelings
unless
you
cherish
them
in
solitude
and
pardon
me
with
romantic
tenderness
then
indeed
time
will
only
confirm
habit
i
am
particularly
empowered
to
speak
on
this
subject
and
to
sympathise
in
your
sufferingsâ€
added
the
count
with
an
air
of
solemnity
â€œfor
i
have
known
what
it
is
to
love
and
to
lament
the
object
of
my
love
yesâ€
continued
he
while
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
â€œi
have
sufferedâ€”but
those
times
have
passed
awayâ€”long
passed
and
i
can
now
look
back
upon
them
without
emotionâ€
â€œmy
dear
sirâ€
said
emily
timidly
â€œwhat
mean
those
tearsâ€”they
speak
i
fear
another
languageâ€”they
plead
for
meâ€
â€œthey
are
weak
tears
for
they
are
useless
onesâ€
replied
the
count
drying
them
â€œi
would
have
you
superior
to
such
weakness
these
however
are
only
faint
traces
of
a
grief
which
if
it
had
not
been
opposed
by
long
continued
effort
might
have
led
me
to
the
verge
of
madness
judge
then
whether
i
have
not
cause
to
warn
you
of
an
indulgence
which
may
produce
so
terrible
an
effect
and
which
must
certainly
if
not
opposed
overcloud
the
years
that
otherwise
might
be
happy
m
du
pont
is
a
sensible
and
amiable
man
who
has
long
been
tenderly
attached
to
you
his
family
and
fortune
are
unexceptionableâ€”after
what
i
have
said
it
is
unnecessary
to
add
that
i
should
rejoice
in
your
felicity
and
that
i
think
m
du
pont
would
promote
it
do
not
weep
emilyâ€
continued
the
count
taking
her
hand
â€œthere
is
happiness
reserved
for
youâ€
he
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
added
in
a
firmer
voice
â€œi
do
not
wish
that
you
should
make
a
violent
effort
to
overcome
your
feelings
all
i
at
present
ask
is
that
you
will
check
the
thoughts
that
would
lead
you
to
a
remembrance
of
the
past
that
you
will
suffer
your
mind
to
be
engaged
by
present
objects
that
you
will
allow
yourself
to
believe
it
possible
you
may
yet
be
happy
and
that
you
will
sometimes
think
with
complacency
of
poor
du
pont
and
not
condemn
him
to
the
state
of
despondency
from
which
my
dear
emily
i
am
endeavouring
to
withdraw
youâ€
â€œah
my
dear
sirâ€
said
emily
while
her
tears
still
fell
â€œdo
not
suffer
the
benevolence
of
your
wishes
to
mislead
mons
du
pont
with
an
expectation
that
i
can
ever
accept
his
hand
if
i
understand
my
own
heart
this
never
can
be
your
instruction
i
can
obey
in
almost
every
other
particular
than
that
of
adopting
a
contrary
beliefâ€
â€œleave
me
to
understand
your
heartâ€
replied
the
count
with
a
faint
smile
â€œif
you
pay
me
the
compliment
to
be
guided
by
my
advice
in
other
instances
i
will
pardon
your
incredulity
respecting
your
future
conduct
towards
mons
du
pont
i
will
not
even
press
you
to
remain
longer
at
the
chã¢teau
than
your
own
satisfaction
will
permit
but
though
i
forbear
to
oppose
your
present
retirement
i
shall
urge
the
claims
of
friendship
for
your
future
visitsâ€
tears
of
gratitude
mingled
with
those
of
tender
regret
while
emily
thanked
the
count
for
the
many
instances
of
friendship
she
had
received
from
him
promised
to
be
directed
by
his
advice
upon
every
subject
but
one
and
assured
him
of
the
pleasure
with
which
she
should
at
some
future
period
accept
the
invitation
of
the
countess
and
himselfâ€”if
mons
du
pont
was
not
at
the
chã¢teau
the
count
smiled
at
this
condition
â€œbe
it
soâ€
said
he
â€œmeanwhile
the
convent
is
so
near
the
chã¢teau
that
my
daughter
and
i
shall
often
visit
you
and
if
sometimes
we
should
dare
to
bring
you
another
visitorâ€”will
you
forgive
usâ€
emily
looked
distressed
and
remained
silent
â€œwellâ€
rejoined
the
count
â€œi
will
pursue
this
subject
no
further
and
must
now
entreat
your
forgiveness
for
having
pressed
it
thus
far
you
will
however
do
me
the
justice
to
believe
that
i
have
been
urged
only
by
a
sincere
regard
for
your
happiness
and
that
of
my
amiable
friend
mons
du
pontâ€
emily
when
she
left
the
count
went
to
mention
her
intended
departure
to
the
countess
who
opposed
it
with
polite
expressions
of
regret
after
which
she
sent
a
note
to
acquaint
the
lady
abbess
that
she
should
return
to
the
convent
and
thither
she
withdrew
on
the
evening
of
the
following
day
m
du
pont
in
extreme
regret
saw
her
depart
while
the
count
endeavoured
to
cheer
him
with
a
hope
that
emily
would
sometimes
regard
him
with
a
more
favourable
eye
she
was
pleased
to
find
herself
once
more
in
the
tranquil
retirement
of
the
convent
where
she
experienced
a
renewal
of
all
the
maternal
kindness
of
the
abbess
and
of
the
sisterly
attentions
of
the
nuns
a
report
of
the
late
extraordinary
occurrence
at
the
chã¢teau
had
already
reached
them
and
after
supper
on
the
evening
of
her
arrival
it
was
the
subject
of
conversation
in
the
convent
parlour
where
she
was
requested
to
mention
some
particulars
of
that
unaccountable
event
emily
was
guarded
in
her
conversation
on
this
subject
and
briefly
related
a
few
circumstances
concerning
ludovico
whose
disappearance
her
auditors
almost
unanimously
agreed
had
been
effected
by
supernatural
means
â€œa
belief
had
so
long
prevailedâ€
said
a
nun
who
was
called
sister
frances
â€œthat
the
chã¢teau
was
haunted
that
i
was
surprised
when
i
heard
the
count
had
the
temerity
to
inhabit
it
its
former
possessor
i
fear
had
some
deed
of
conscience
to
atone
for
let
us
hope
that
the
virtues
of
its
present
owner
will
preserve
him
from
the
punishment
due
to
the
errors
of
the
last
if
indeed
he
was
a
criminalâ€
â€œof
what
crime
then
was
he
suspectedâ€
said
a
mademoiselle
feydeau
a
boarder
at
the
convent
â€œlet
us
pray
for
his
soulâ€
said
a
nun
who
had
till
now
sat
in
silent
attention
â€œif
he
was
criminal
his
punishment
in
this
world
was
sufficientâ€
there
was
a
mixture
of
wildness
and
solemnity
in
her
manner
of
delivering
this
which
struck
emily
exceedingly
but
mademoiselle
repeated
her
question
without
noticing
the
solemn
eagerness
of
the
nun
â€œi
dare
not
presume
to
say
what
was
his
crimeâ€
replied
sister
frances
â€œbut
i
have
heard
many
reports
of
an
extraordinary
nature
respecting
the
late
marquis
de
villeroi
and
among
others
that
soon
after
the
death
of
his
lady
he
quitted
chã¢teau-le-blanc
and
never
afterwards
returned
to
it
i
was
not
here
at
the
time
so
i
can
only
mention
it
from
report
and
so
many
years
have
passed
since
the
marchioness
died
that
few
of
our
sisterhood
i
believe
can
do
moreâ€
â€œbut
i
canâ€
said
the
nun
who
had
before
spoke
and
whom
they
called
sister
agnes
â€œyou
thenâ€
said
mademoiselle
feydeau
â€œare
possibly
acquainted
with
circumstances
that
enable
you
to
judge
whether
he
was
criminal
or
not
and
what
was
the
crime
imputed
to
himâ€
â€œi
amâ€
replied
the
nun
â€œbut
who
shall
dare
to
scrutinize
my
thoughtsâ€”who
shall
dare
to
pluck
out
my
opinion
god
only
is
his
judge
and
to
that
judge
he
is
goneâ€
emily
looked
with
surprise
at
sister
frances
who
returned
her
a
significant
glance
â€œi
only
requested
your
opinionâ€
said
mademoiselle
feydeau
mildly
â€œif
the
subject
is
displeasing
to
you
i
will
drop
itâ€
â€œdispleasingâ€â€”said
the
nun
with
emphasisâ€”â€œwe
are
idle
talkers
we
do
not
weigh
the
meaning
of
the
words
we
use
displeasing
is
a
poor
word
i
will
go
prayâ€
as
she
said
this
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
with
a
profound
sigh
quitted
the
room
â€œwhat
can
be
the
meaning
of
thisâ€
said
emily
when
she
was
gone
â€œit
is
nothing
extraordinaryâ€
replied
sister
frances
â€œshe
is
often
thus
but
she
had
no
meaning
in
what
she
says
her
intellects
are
at
times
deranged
did
you
never
see
her
thus
beforeâ€
â€œneverâ€
said
emily
â€œi
have
indeed
sometimes
thought
that
there
was
the

poor
soul
i
will
pray
for
herâ€
â€œyour

my

with
oursâ€
observed
the
lady
abbess
â€œshe
has
need
of
themâ€
â€œdear
ladyâ€
said
mademoiselle
feydeau
addressing
the
abbess
â€œwhat
is
your
opinion
of
the
late
marquis
the
strange
circumstances
that
have
occurred
at
the
chã¢teau
have
so
much
awakened
my
curiosity
that
i
shall
be
pardoned
the
question
what
was
his
imputed
crime
and
what
the
punishment
to
which
sister
agnes
alludedâ€
â€œwe
must
be
cautious
of
advancing
our
opinionâ€
said
the
abbess
with
an
air
of
reserve
mingled
with
solemnity
â€œwe
must
be
cautious
of
advancing
our
opinion
on
so
delicate
a
subject
i
will
not
take
upon
me
to
pronounce
that
the
late
marquis
was
criminal
or
to
say
what
was
the
crime
of
which
he
was
suspected
but
concerning
the
punishment
our
daughter
agnes
hinted
i
know
of
none
he
suffered
she
probably
alluded
to
the
severe
one
which
an
exasperated
conscience
can
inflict
beware
my
children
of
incurring
so
terrible
a
punishmentâ€”it
is
the
purgatory
of
this
life
the
late
marchioness
i
knew
well
she
was
a
pattern
to
such
as
live
in
the
world
nay
our
sacred
order
need
not
have
blushed
to
copy
her
virtues
our
holy
convent
received
her
mortal
part
her
heavenly
spirit
i
doubt
not
ascended
to
its
sanctuaryâ€
as
the
abbess
spoke
this
the
last
bell
of
vespers
struck
up
and
she
rose
â€œlet
us
go
my
childrenâ€
said
she
â€œand
intercede
for
the
wretched
let
us
go
and
confess
our
sins
and
endeavour
to
purify
our
souls
for
the
heaven
to
which
she
is
goneâ€
emily
was
affected
by
the
solemnity
of
this
exhortation
and
remembering
her
father
â€œthe
heaven
to
which
he
too
is
goneâ€
said
she
faintly
as
she
suppressed
her
sighs
and
followed
the
abbess
and
the
nuns
to
the
chapel

hamlet
count
de
villefort
at
length
received
a
letter
from
the
advocate
at
avignon
encouraging
emily
to
assert
her
claim
to
the
estates
of
the
late
madame
montoni
and
about
the
same
time
a
messenger
arrived
from
monsieur
quesnel
with
intelligence
that
made
an
appeal
to
the
law
on
this
subject
unnecessary
since
it
appeared
that
the
only
person
who
could
have
opposed
her
claim
was
now
no
more
a
friend
of
monsieur
quesnel
who
resided
at
venice
had
sent
him
an
account
of
the
death
of
montoni
who
had
been
brought
to
trial
with
orsino
as
his
supposed
accomplice
in
the
murder
of
the
venetian
nobleman
orsino
was
found
guilty
condemned
and
executed
upon
the
wheel
but
nothing
being
discovered
to
criminate
montoni
and
his
colleagues
on
this
charge
they
were
all
released
except
montoni
who
being
considered
by
the
senate
as
a
very
dangerous
person
was
for
other
reasons
ordered
again
into
confinement
where
it
was
said
he
had
died
in
a
doubtful
and
mysterious
manner
and
not
without
suspicion
of
having
been
poisoned
the
authority
from
which
m
quesnel
had
received
this
information
would
not
allow
him
to
doubt
its
truth
and
he
told
emily
that
she
had
now
only
to
lay
claim
to
the
estates
of
her
late
aunt
to
secure
them
and
added
that
he
would
himself
assist
in
the
necessary
forms
of
this
business
the
term
for
which
la
vallã©e
had
been
let
being
now
also
nearly
expired
he
acquainted
her
with
the
circumstance
and
advised
her
to
take
the
road
thither
through
thoulouse
where
he
promised
to
meet
her
and
where
it
would
be
proper
for
her
to
take
possession
of
the
estates
of
the
late
madame
montoni
adding
that
he
would
spare
her
any
difficulties
that
might
occur
on
that
occasion
from
the
want
of
knowledge
on
the
subject
and
that
he
believed
it
would
be
necessary
for
her
to
be
at
thoulouse
in
about
three
weeks
from
the
present
time
an
increase
of
fortune
seemed
to
have
awakened
this
sudden
kindness
in
m
quesnel
towards
his
niece
and
it
appeared
that
he
entertained
more
respect
for
the
rich
heiress
than
he
had
ever
felt
compassion
for
the
poor
and
unfriended
orphan
the
pleasure
with
which
she
received
this
intelligence
was
clouded
when
she
considered
that
he
for
whose
sake
she
had
once
regretted
the
want
of
fortune
was
no
longer
worthy
of
sharing
it
with
her
but
remembering
the
friendly
admonition
of
the
count
she
checked
this
melancholy
reflection
and
endeavoured
to
feel
only
gratitude
for
the
unexpected
good
that
now
attended
her
while
it
formed
no
inconsiderable
part
of
her
satisfaction
to
know
that
la
vallã©e
her
native
home
which
was
endeared
to
her
by
itâ€™s
having
been
the
residence
of
her
parents
would
soon
be
restored
to
her
possession
there
she
meant
to
fix
her
future
residence
for
though
it
could
not
be
compared
with
the
chã¢teau
at
thoulouse
either
for
extent
or
magnificence
its
pleasant
scenes
and
the
tender
remembrances
that
haunted
them
had
claims
upon
her
heart
which
she
was
not
inclined
to
sacrifice
to
ostentation
she
wrote
immediately
to
thank
m
quesnel
for
the
active
interest
he
took
in
her
concerns
and
to
say
that
she
would
meet
him
at
thoulouse
at
the
appointed
time
when
count
de
villefort
with
blanche
came
to
the
convent
to
give
emily
the
advice
of
the
advocate
he
was
informed
of
the
contents
of
m
quesnelâ€™s
letter
and
gave
her
his
sincere
congratulations
on
the
occasion
but
she
observed
that
when
the
first
expression
of
satisfaction
had
faded
from
his
countenance
an
unusual
gravity
succeeded
and
she
scarcely
hesitated
to
enquire
its
cause
â€œit
has
no
new
occasionâ€
replied
the
count
â€œi
am
harassed
and
perplexed
by
the
confusion
into
which
my
family
is
thrown
by
their
foolish
superstition
idle
reports
are
floating
round
me
which
i
can
neither
admit
to
be
true
nor
prove
to
be
false
and
i
am
also
very
anxious
about
the
poor
fellow
ludovico
concerning
whom
i
have
not
been
able
to
obtain
information
every
part
of
the
chã¢teau
and
every
part
of
the
neighbourhood
too
has
i
believe
been
searched
and
i
know
not
what
further
can
be
done
since
i
have
already
offered
large
rewards
for
the
discovery
of
him
the
keys
of
the
north
apartment
i
have
not
suffered
to
be
out
of
my
possession
since
he
disappeared
and
i
mean
to
watch
in
those
chambers
myself
this
very
nightâ€
emily
seriously
alarmed
for
the
count
united
her
entreaties
with
those
of
the
lady
blanche
to
dissuade
him
from
his
purpose
â€œwhat
should
i
fearâ€
said
he
â€œi
have
no
faith
in
supernatural
combats
and
for
human
opposition
i
shall
be
prepared
nay
i
will
even
promise
not
to
watch
aloneâ€
â€œbut
who
dear
sir
will
have
courage
enough
to
watch
with
youâ€
said
emily
â€œmy
sonâ€
replied
the
count
â€œif
i
am
not
carried
off
in
the
nightâ€
added
he
smiling
â€œyou
shall
hear
the
result
of
my
adventure
tomorrowâ€
the
count
and
lady
blanche
shortly
afterwards
took
leave
of
emily
and
returned
to
the
chã¢teau
where
he
informed
henri
of
his
intention
who
not
without
some
secret
reluctance
consented
to
be
the
partner
of
his
watch
and
when
the
design
was
mentioned
after
supper
the
countess
was
terrified
and
the
baron
and
m
du
pont
joined
with
her
in
entreating
that
he
would
not
tempt
his
fate
as
ludovico
had
done
â€œwe
know
notâ€
added
the
baron
â€œthe
nature
or
the
power
of
an
evil
spirit
and
that
such
a
spirit
haunts
those
chambers
can
now
i
think
scarcely
be
doubted
beware
my
lord
how
you
provoke
its
vengeance
since
it
has
already
given
us
one
terrible
example
of
its
malice
i
allow
it
may
be
probable
that
the
spirits
of
the
dead
are
permitted
to
return
to
the
earth
only
on
occasions
of
high
import
but
the
present
import
may
be
your
destructionâ€
the
count
could
not
forbear
smiling
â€œdo
you
think
then
baronâ€
said
he
â€œthat
my
destruction
is
of
sufficient
importance
to
draw
back
to
earth
the
soul
of
the
departed
alas
my
good
friend
there
is
no
occasion
for
such
means
to
accomplish
the
destruction
of
any
individual
wherever
the
mystery
rests
i
trust
i
shall
this
night
be
able
to
detect
it
you
know
i
am
not

â€œi
know
that
you
are
incredulousâ€
interrupted
the
baron
â€œwell
call
it
what
you
will
i
mean
to
say
that
though
you
know
i
am
free
from
superstitionâ€”if
anything
supernatural
has
appeared
i
doubt
not
it
will
appear
to
me
and
if
any
strange
event
hangs
over
my
house
or
if
any
extraordinary
transaction
has
formerly
been
connected
with
it
i
shall
probably
be
made
acquainted
with
it
at
all

i
will
invite

that
i
may
be
equal
to
a
mortal
attack
which
in
good
truth
my
friend
is
what
i
most
expect
i
shall
take
care
to
be
well
armedâ€
the
count
took
leave
of
his
family
for
the
night
with
an
assumed
gaiety
which
but
ill
concealed
the
anxiety
that
depressed
his
spirits
and
retired
to
the
north
apartments
accompanied
by
his
son
and
followed
by
the
baron
m
du
pont
and
some
of
the
domestics
who
all
bade
him
good
night
at
the
outer
door
in
these
chambers
everything
appeared
as
when
he
had
last
been
here
even
in
the
bedroom
no
alteration
was
visible
where
he
lighted
his
own
fire
for
none
of
the
domestics
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
venture
thither
after
carefully
examining
the
chamber
and
the
oriel
the
count
and
henri
drew
their
chairs
upon
the
hearth
set
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
lamp
before
them
laid
their
swords
upon
the
table
and
stirring
the
wood
into
a
blaze
began
to
converse
on
indifferent
topics
but
henri
was
often
silent
and
abstracted
and
sometimes
threw
a
glance
of
mingled
awe
and
curiosity
round
the
gloomy
apartment
while
the
count
gradually
ceased
to
converse
and
sat
either
lost
in
thought
or
reading
a
volume
of
tacitus
which
he
had
brought
to
beguile
the
tediousness
of
the
night

shakespeare
the
baron
st
foix
whom
anxiety
for
his
friend
had
kept
awake
rose
early
to
enquire
the
event
of
the
night
when
as
he
passed
the
countâ€™s
closet
hearing
steps
within
he
knocked
at
the
door
and
it
was
opened
by
his
friend
himself
rejoicing
to
see
him
in
safety
and
curious
to
learn
the
occurrences
of
the
night
he
had
not
immediately
leisure
to
observe
the
unusual
gravity
that
overspread
the
features
of
the
count
whose
reserved
answers
first
occasioned
him
to
notice
it
the
count
then
smiling
endeavoured
to
treat
the
subject
of
his
curiosity
with
levity
but
the
baron
was
serious
and
pursued
his
enquiries
so
closely
that
the
count
at
length
resuming
his
gravity
said
â€œwell
my
friend
press
the
subject
no
further
i
entreat
you
and
let
me
request
also
that
you
will
hereafter
be
silent
upon
anything
you
may
think
extraordinary
in
my
future
conduct
i
do
not
scruple
to
tell
you
that
i
am
unhappy
and
that
the
watch
of
the
last
night
has
not
assisted
me
to
discover
ludovico
upon
every
occurrence
of
the
night
you
must
excuse
my
reserveâ€
â€œbut
where
is
henriâ€
said
the
baron
with
surprise
and
disappointment
at
this
denial
â€œhe
is
well
in
his
own
apartmentâ€
replied
the
count
â€œyou
will
not
question
him
on
this
topic
my
friend
since
you
know
my
wishâ€
â€œcertainly
notâ€
said
the
baron
somewhat
chagrined
â€œsince
it
would
be
displeasing
to
you
but
methinks
my
friend
you
might
rely
on
my
discretion
and
drop
this
unusual
reserve
however
you
must
allow
me
to
suspect
that
you
have
seen
reason
to
become
a
convert
to
my
system
and
are
no
longer
the
incredulous
knight
you
lately
appeared
to
beâ€
â€œlet
us
talk
no
more
upon
this
subjectâ€
said
the
count
â€œyou
may
be
assured
that
no
ordinary
circumstance
has
imposed
this
silence
upon
me
towards
a
friend
whom
i
have
called
so
for
near
thirty
years
and
my
present
reserve
cannot
make
you
question
either
my
esteem
or
the
sincerity
of
my
friendshipâ€
â€œi
will
not
doubt
eitherâ€
said
the
baron
â€œthough
you
must
allow
me
to
express
my
surprise
at
this
silenceâ€
â€œto
me
i
will
allow
itâ€
replied
the
count
â€œbut
i
earnestly
entreat
that
you
will
forbear
to
notice
it
to
my
family
as
well
as
everything
remarkable
you
may
observe
in
my
conduct
towards
themâ€
the
baron
readily
promised
this
and
after
conversing
for
some
time
on
general
topics
they
descended
to
the
breakfast-room
where
the
count
met
his
family
with
a
cheerful
countenance
and
evaded
their
enquiries
by
employing
light
ridicule
and
assuming
an
air
of
uncommon
gaiety
while
he
assured
them
that
they
need
not
apprehend
any
evil
from
the
north
chambers
since
henri
and
himself
had
been
permitted
to
return
from
them
in
safety
henri
however
was
less
successful
in
disguising
his
feelings
from
his
countenance
an
expression
of
terror
was
not
entirely
faded
he
was
often
silent
and
thoughtful
and
when
he
attempted
to
laugh
at
the
eager
enquiries
of
mademoiselle
bearn
it
was
evidently
only
an
attempt
in
the
evening
the
count
called
as
he
had
promised
at
the
convent
and
emily
was
surprised
to
perceive
a
mixture
of
playful
ridicule
and
of
reserve
in
his
mention
of
the
north
apartment
of
what
had
occurred
there
however
he
said
nothing
and
when
she
ventured
to
remind
him
of
his
promise
to
tell
her
the
result
of
his
enquiries
and
to
ask
if
he
had
received
any
proof
that
those
chambers
were
haunted
his
look
became
solemn
for
a
moment
then
seeming
to
recollect
himself
he
smiled
and
said
â€œmy
dear
emily
do
not
suffer
my
lady
abbess
to
infect
your
good
understanding
with
these
fancies
she
will
teach
you
to
expect
a
ghost
in
every
dark
room
but
believe
meâ€
added
he
with
a
profound
sigh
â€œthe
apparition
of
the
dead
comes
not
on
light
or
sportive
errands
to
terrify
or
to
surprise
the
timidâ€
he
paused
and
fell
into
a
momentary
thoughtfulness
and
then
added
â€œwe
will
say
no
more
on
this
subjectâ€
soon
after
he
took
leave
and
when
emily
joined
some
of
the
nuns
she
was
surprised
to
find
them
acquainted
with
a
circumstance
which
she
had
carefully
avoided
to
mention
and
expressing
their
admiration
of
his
intrepidity
in
having
dared
to
pass
a
night
in
the
apartment
whence
ludovico
had
disappeared
for
she
had
not
considered
with
what
rapidity
a
tale
of
wonder
circulates
the
nuns
had
acquired
their
information
from
peasants
who
brought
fruit
to
the
monastery
and
whose
whole
attention
had
been
fixed
since
the
disappearance
of
ludovico
on
what
was
passing
in
the
castle
emily
listened
in
silence
to
the
various
opinions
of
the
nuns
concerning
the
conduct
of
the
count
most
of
whom
condemned
it
as
rash
and
presumptuous
affirming
that
it
was
provoking
the
vengeance
of
an
evil
spirit
thus
to
intrude
upon
its
haunts
sister
frances
contended
that
the
count
had
acted
with
the
bravery
of
a
virtuous
mind
he
knew
himself
guiltless
of
aught
that
should
provoke
a
good
spirit
and
did
not
fear
the
spells
of
an
evil
one
since
he
could
claim
the
protection
of
a
higher
power
of
him
who
can
command
the
wicked
and
will
protect
the
innocent
â€œthe
guilty
cannot
claim
that
protectionâ€
said
sister
agnes
â€œlet
the
count
look
to
his
conduct
that
he
do
not
forfeit
his
claim
yet
who
is
he
that
shall
dare
to
call
himself
innocentâ€”all
earthly
innocence
is
but
comparative
yet
still
how
wide
asunder
are
the
extremes
of
guilt
and
to
what
a
horrible
depth
may
we
fall
ohâ€”â€
the
nun
as
she
concluded
uttered
a
shuddering
sigh
that
startled
emily
who
looking
up
perceived
the
eyes
of
agnes
fixed
on
hers
after
which
the
sister
rose
took
her
hand
gazed
earnestly
upon
her
countenance
for
some
moments
in
silence
and
then
said
â€œyou
are
youngâ€”you
are
innocent
i
mean
you
are
yet
innocent
of
any
great
crimeâ€”but
you
have
passions
in
your
heartâ€”scorpions
they
sleep
nowâ€”beware
how
you
awaken
themâ€”they
will
sting
you
even
unto
deathâ€
emily
affected
by
these
words
and
by
the
solemnity
with
which
they
were
delivered
could
not
suppress
her
tears
â€œah
is
it
soâ€
exclaimed
agnes
her
countenance
softening
from
its
sternnessâ€”â€œso
young
and
so
unfortunate
we
are
sisters
then
indeed
yet
there
is
no
bond
of
kindness
among
the
guiltyâ€
she
added
while
her
eyes
resumed
their
wild
expression
â€œno
gentlenessâ€”no
peace
no
hope
i
knew
them
all
onceâ€”my
eyes
could
weepâ€”but
now
they
burn
for
now
my
soul
is
fixed
and
fearlessâ€”i
lament
no
moreâ€
â€œrather
let
us
repent
and
prayâ€
said
another
nun
â€œwe
are
taught
to
hope
that
prayer
and
penitence
will
work
our
salvation
there
is
hope
for
all
who
repentâ€
â€œwho
repent
and
turn
to
the
true
faithâ€
observed
sister
frances
â€œfor
all
but
meâ€
replied
agnes
solemnly
who
paused
and
then
abruptly
added
â€œmy
head
burns
i
believe
i
am
not
well
o
could
i
strike
from
my
memory
all
former
scenesâ€”the
figures
that
rise
up
like
furies
to
torment
meâ€”i
see
them
when
i
sleep
and
when
i
am
awake
they
are
still
before
my
eyes
i
see
them
nowâ€”nowâ€
she
stood
in
a
fixed
attitude
of
horror
her
straining
eyes
moving
slowly
round
the
room
as
if
they
followed
something
one
of
the
nuns
gently
took
her
hand
to
lead
her
from
the
parlour
agnes
became
calm
drew
her
other
hand
across
her
eyes
looked
again
and
sighing
deeply
said
â€œthey
are
goneâ€”they
are
gone
i
am
feverish
i
know
not
what
i
say
i
am
thus
sometimes
but
it
will
go
off
again
i
shall
soon
be
better
was
not
that
the
vesper-bellâ€
â€œnoâ€
replied
frances
â€œthe
evening
service
is
passed
let
margaret
lead
you
to
your
cellâ€
â€œyou
are
rightâ€
replied
sister
agnes
â€œi
shall
be
better
there
good
night
my
sisters
remember
me
in
your
orisonsâ€
when
they
had
withdrawn
frances
observing
emilyâ€™s
emotion
said
â€œdo
not
be
alarmed
our
sister
is
often
thus
deranged
though
i
have
not
lately
seen
her
so
frantic
her
usual
mood
is
melancholy
this
fit
has
been
coming
on
for
several
days
seclusion
and
the
customary
treatment
will
restore
herâ€
â€œbut
how
rationally
she
conversed
at
firstâ€
observed
emily
â€œher
ideas
followed
each
other
in
perfect
orderâ€
â€œyesâ€
replied
the
nun
â€œthis
is
nothing
new
nay
i
have
sometimes
known
her
argue
not
only
with
method
but
with
acuteness
and
then
in
a
moment
start
off
into
madnessâ€
â€œher
conscience
seems
afflictedâ€
said
emily
â€œdid
you
ever
hear
what
circumstance
reduced
her
to
this
deplorable
conditionâ€
â€œi
haveâ€
replied
the
nun
who
said
no
more
till
emily
repeated
the
question
when
she
added
in
a
low
voice
and
looking
significantly
towards
the
other
boarders
â€œi
cannot
tell
you
now
but
if
you
think
it
worth
your
while
come
to
my
cell
tonight
when
our
sisterhood
are
at
rest
and
you
shall
hear
more
but
remember
we
rise
to
midnight
prayers
and
come
either
before
or
after
midnightâ€
emily
promised
to
remember
and
the
abbess
soon
after
appearing
they
spoke
no
more
of
the
unhappy
nun
the
count
meanwhile
on
his
return
home
had
found
m
du
pont
in
one
of
those
fits
of
despondency
which
his
attachment
to
emily
frequently
occasioned
him
an
attachment
that
had
subsisted
too
long
to
be
easily
subdued
and
which
had
already
outlived
the
opposition
of
his
friends
m
du
pont
had
first
seen
emily
in
gascony
during
the
lifetime
of
his
parent
who
on
discovering
his
sonâ€™s
partiality
for
mademoiselle
st
aubert
his
inferior
in
point
of
fortune
forbade
him
to
declare
it
to
her
family
or
to
think
of
her
more
during
the
life
of
his
father
he
had
observed
the
first
command
but
had
found
it
impracticable
to
obey
the
second
and
had
sometimes
soothed
his
passion
by
visiting
her
favourite
haunts
among
which
was
the
fishing-house
where
once
or
twice
he
addressed
her
in
verse
concealing
his
name
in
obedience
to
the
promise
he
had
given
his
father
there
too
he
played
the
pathetic
air
to
which
she
had
listened
with
such
surprise
and
admiration
and
there
he
found
the
miniature
that
had
since
cherished
a
passion
fatal
to
his
repose
during
his
expedition
into
italy
his
father
died
but
he
received
his
liberty
at
a
moment
when
he
was
the
least
enabled
to
profit
by
it
since
the
object
that
rendered
it
most
valuable
was
no
longer
within
the
reach
of
his
vows
by
what
accident
he
discovered
emily
and
assisted
to
release
her
from
a
terrible
imprisonment
has
already
appeared
and
also
the
unavailing
hope
with
which
he
then
encouraged
his
love
and
the
fruitless
efforts
that
he
had
since
made
to
overcome
it
the
count
still
endeavoured
with
friendly
zeal
to
sooth
him
with
a
belief
that
patience
perseverance
and
prudence
would
finally
obtain
for
him
happiness
and
emily
â€œtimeâ€
said
he
â€œwill
wear
away
the
melancholy
impression
which
disappointment
has
left
on
her
mind
and
she
will
be
sensible
of
your
merit
your
services
have
already
awakened
her
gratitude
and
your
sufferings
her
pity
and
trust
me
my
friend
in
a
heart
so
sensible
as
hers
gratitude
and
pity
lead
to
love
when
her
imagination
is
rescued
from
its
present
delusion
she
will
readily
accept
the
homage
of
a
mind
like
yoursâ€
du
pont
sighed
while
he
listened
to
these
words
and
endeavouring
to
hope
what
his
friend
believed
he
willingly
yielded
to
an
invitation
to
prolong
his
visit
at
the
chã¢teau
which
we
now
leave
for
the
monastery
of
st
claire
when
the
nuns
had
retired
to
rest
emily
stole
to
her
appointment
with
sister
frances
whom
she
found
in
her
cell
engaged
in
prayer
before
a
little
table
where
appeared
the
image
she
was
addressing
and
above
the
dim
lamp
that
gave
light
to
the
place
turning
her
eyes
as
the
door
opened
she
beckoned
to
emily
to
come
in
who
having
done
so
seated
herself
in
silence
beside
the
nunâ€™s
little
mattress
of
straw
till
her
orisons
should
conclude
the
latter
soon
rose
from
her
knees
and
taking
down
the
lamp
and
placing
it
on
the
table
emily
perceived
there
a
human
skull
and
bones
lying
beside
an
hour-glass
but
the
nun
without
observing
her
emotion
sat
down
on
the
mattress
by
her
saying
â€œyour
curiosity
sister
has
made
you
punctual
but
you
have
nothing
remarkable
to
hear
in
the
history
of
poor
agnes
of
whom
i
avoided
to
speak
in
the
presence
of
my
lay-sisters
only
because
i
would
not
publish
her
crime
to
themâ€
â€œi
shall
consider
your
confidence
in
me
as
a
favourâ€
said
emily
â€œand
will
not
misuse
itâ€
â€œsister
agnesâ€
resumed
the
nun
â€œis
of
a
noble
family
as
the
dignity
of
her
air
must
already
have
informed
you
but
i
will
not
dishonour
their
name
so
much
as
to
reveal
it
love
was
the
occasion
of
her
crime
and
of
her
madness
she
was
beloved
by
a
gentleman
of
inferior
fortune
and
her
father
as
i
have
heard
bestowing
her
on
a
nobleman
whom
she
disliked
an
ill-governed
passion
proved
her
destructionâ€”every
obligation
of
virtue
and
of
duty
was
forgotten
and
she
prophaned
her
marriage
vows
but
her
guilt
was
soon
detected
and
she
would
have
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
the
vengeance
of
her
husband
had
not
her
father
contrived
to
convey
her
from
his
power
by
what
means
he
did
this
i
never
could
learn
but
he
secreted
her
in
this
convent
where
he
afterwards
prevailed
with
her
to
take
the
veil
while
a
report
was
circulated
in
the
world
that
she
was
dead
and
the
father
to
save
his
daughter
assisted
the
rumour
and
employed
such
means
as
induced
her
husband
to
believe
she
had
become
a
victim
to
his
jealousy
you
look
surprisedâ€
added
the
nun
observing
emilyâ€™s
countenance
â€œi
allow
the
story
is
uncommon
but
not
i
believe
without
a
parallelâ€
â€œpray
proceedâ€
said
emily
â€œi
am
interestedâ€
â€œthe
story
is
already
toldâ€
resumed
the
nun
â€œi
have
only
to
mention
that
the
long
struggle
which
agnes
suffered
between
love
remorse
and
a
sense
of
the
duties
she
had
taken
upon
herself
in
becoming
of
our
order
at
length
unsettled
her
reason
at
first
she
was
frantic
and
melancholy
by
quick
alternatives
then
she
sunk
into
a
deep
and
settled
melancholy
which
still
however
has
at
times
been
interrupted
by
fits
of
wildness
and
of
late
these
have
again
been
frequentâ€
emily
was
affected
by
the
history
of
the
sister
some
parts
of
whose
story
brought
to
her
remembrance
that
of
the
marchioness
de
villeroi
who
had
also
been
compelled
by
her
father
to
forsake
the
object
of
her
affections
for
a
nobleman
of
his
choice
but
from
what
dorothã©e
had
related
there
appeared
no
reason
to
suppose
that
she
had
escaped
the
vengeance
of
a
jealous
husband
or
to
doubt
for
a
moment
the
innocence
of
her
conduct
but
emily
while
she
sighed
over
the
misery
of
the
nun
could
not
forbear
shedding
a
few
tears
to
the
misfortunes
of
the
marchioness
and
when
she
returned
to
the
mention
of
sister
agnes
she
asked
frances
if
she
remembered
her
in
her
youth
and
whether
she
was
then
beautiful
â€œi
was
not
here
at
the
time
when
she
took
the
vowsâ€
replied
frances
â€œwhich
is
so
long
ago
that
few
of
the
present
sisterhood
i
believe
were
witnesses
of
the
ceremony
nay
ever
our
lady
mother
did
not
then
preside
over
the
convent
but
i
can
remember
when
sister
agnes
was
a
very
beautiful
woman
she
retains
that
air
of
high
rank
which
always
distinguished
her
but
her
beauty
you
must
perceive
is
fled
i
can
scarcely
discover
even
a
vestige
of
the
loveliness
that
once
animated
her
featuresâ€
â€œit
is
strangeâ€
said
emily
â€œbut
there
are
moments
when
her
countenance
has
appeared
familiar
to
my
memory
you
will
think
me
fanciful
and
i
think
myself
so
for
i
certainly
never
saw
sister
agnes
before
i
came
to
this
convent
and
i
must
therefore
have
seen
some
person
whom
she
strongly
resembles
though
of
this
i
have
no
recollectionâ€
â€œyou
have
been
interested
by
the
deep
melancholy
of
her
countenanceâ€
said
frances
â€œand
its
impression
has
probably
deluded
your
imagination
for
i
might
as
reasonably
think
i
perceive
a
likeness
between
you
and
agnes
as
you
that
you
have
seen
her
anywhere
but
in
this
convent
since
this
has
been
her
place
of
refuge
for
nearly
as
many
years
as
make
your
ageâ€
â€œindeedâ€
said
emily
â€œyesâ€
rejoined
frances
â€œand
why
does
that
circumstance
excite
your
surpriseâ€
emily
did
not
appear
to
notice
this
question
but
remained
thoughtful
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
â€œit
was
about
that
same
period
that
the
marchioness
de
villeroi
expiredâ€
â€œthat
is
an
odd
remarkâ€
said
frances
emily
recalled
from
her
reverie
smiled
and
gave
the
conversation
another
turn
but
it
soon
came
back
to
the
subject
of
the
unhappy
nun
and
emily
remained
in
the
cell
of
sister
frances
till
the
midnight
bell
aroused
her
when
apologising
for
having
interrupted
the
sisterâ€™s
repose
till
this
late
hour
they
quitted
the
cell
together
emily
returned
to
her
chamber
and
the
nun
bearing
a
glimmering
taper
went
to
her
devotion
in
the
chapel
several
days
followed
during
which
emily
saw
neither
the
count
nor
any
of
his
family
and
when
at
length
he
appeared
she
remarked
with
concern
that
his
air
was
unusually
disturbed
â€œmy
spirits
are
harassedâ€
said
he
in
answer
to
her
anxious
enquiries
â€œand
i
mean
to
change
my
residence
for
a
little
while
an
experiment
which
i
hope
will
restore
my
mind
to
its
usual
tranquillity
my
daughter
and
myself
will
accompany
the
baron
st
foix
to
his
chã¢teau
it
lies
in
a
valley
of
the
pyrenees
that
opens
towards
gascony
and
i
have
been
thinking
emily
that
when
you
set
out
for
la
vallã©e
we
may
go
part
of
the
way
together
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
guard
you
towards
your
homeâ€
she
thanked
the
count
for
his
friendly
consideration
and
lamented
that
the
necessity
for
her
going
first
to
thoulouse
would
render
this
plan
impracticable
â€œbut
when
you
are
at
the
baronâ€™s
residenceâ€
she
added
â€œyou
will
be
only
a
short
journey
from
la
vallã©e
and
i
think
sir
you
will
not
leave
the
country
without
visiting
me
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
with
what
pleasure
i
should
receive
you
and
the
lady
blancheâ€
â€œi
do
not
doubt
itâ€
replied
the
count
â€œand
i
will
not
deny
myself
and
blanche
the
pleasure
of
visiting
you
if
your
affairs
should
allow
you
to
be
at
la
vallã©e
about
the
time
when
we
can
meet
you
thereâ€
when
emily
said
that
she
should
hope
to
see
the
countess
also
she
was
not
sorry
to
learn
that
this
lady
was
going
accompanied
by
mademoiselle
bearn
to
pay
a
visit
for
a
few
weeks
to
a
family
in
lower
languedoc
the
count
after
some
further
conversation
on
his
intended
journey
and
on
the
arrangement
of
emilyâ€™s
took
leave
and
many
days
did
not
succeed
this
visit
before
a
second
letter
from
m
quesnel
informed
her
that
he
was
then
at
thoulouse
that
la
vallã©e
was
at
liberty
and
that
he
wished
her
to
set
off
for
the
former
place
where
he
awaited
her
arrival
with
all
possible
dispatch
since
his
own
affairs
pressed
him
to
return
to
gascony
emily
did
not
hesitate
to
obey
him
and
having
taken
an
affecting
leave
of
the
countâ€™s
family
in
which
m
du
pont
was
still
included
and
of
her
friends
at
the
convent
she
set
out
for
thoulouse
attended
by
the
unhappy
annette
and
guarded
by
a
steady
servant
of
the
count
lullâ€™d
in
the
countless
chambers
of
the
brain
our
thoughts
are
linkâ€™d
by
many
a
hidden
chain
awake
but
one
and
lo
what
myriads
rise
each
stamps
its
image
as
the
other
flies
pleasures
of
memory
emily
pursued
her
journey
without
any
accident
along
the
plains
of
languedoc
towards
the
north-west
and
on
this
her
return
to
thoulouse
which
she
had
last
left
with
madame
montoni
she
thought
much
on
the
melancholy
fate
of
her
aunt
who
but
for
her
own
imprudence
might
now
have
been
living
in
happiness
there
montoni
too
often
rose
to
her
fancy
such
as
she
had
seen
him
in
his
days
of
triumph
bold
spirited
and
commanding
such
also
as
she
had
since
beheld
him
in
his
days
of
vengeance
and
now
only
a
few
short
months
had
passedâ€”and
he
had
no
longer
the
power
or
the
will
to
afflictâ€”he
had
become
a
clod
of
earth
and
his
life
was
vanished
like
a
shadow
emily
could
have
wept
at
his
fate
had
she
not
remembered
his
crimes
for
that
of
her
unfortunate
aunt
she
did
weep
and
all
sense
of
her
errors
was
overcome
by
the
recollection
of
her
misfortunes
other
thoughts
and
other
emotions
succeeded
as
emily
drew
near
the
well-known
scenes
of
her
early
love
and
considered
that
valancourt
was
lost
to
her
and
to
himself
for
ever
at
length
she
came
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
whence
on
her
departure
for
italy
she
had
given
a
farewell
look
to
this
beloved
landscape
amongst
whose
woods
and
fields
she
had
so
often
walked
with
valancourt
and
where
he
was
then
to
inhabit
when
she
would
be
far
far
away
she
saw
once
more
that
chain
of
the
pyrenees
which
overlooked
la
vallã©e
rising
like
faint
clouds
on
the
horizon
â€œthere
too
is
gascony
extended
at
their
feetâ€
said
she
â€œo
my
fatherâ€”my
mother
and
there
too
is
the
garonneâ€
she
added
drying
the
tears
that
obscured
her
sightâ€”â€œand
thoulouse
and
my
auntâ€™s
mansionâ€”and
the
groves
in
her
gardenâ€”o
my
friends
are
ye
all
lost
to
meâ€”must
i
never
never
see
ye
moreâ€
tears
rushed
again
to
her
eyes
and
she
continued
to
weep
till
an
abrupt
turn
in
the
road
had
nearly
occasioned
the
carriage
to
overset
when
looking
up
she
perceived
another
part
of
the
well-known
scene
around
thoulouse
and
all
the
reflections
and
anticipations
which
she
had
suffered
at
the
moment
when
she
bade
it
last
adieu
came
with
recollected
force
to
her
heart
she
remembered
how
anxiously
she
had
looked
forward
to
the
futurity
which
was
to
decide
her
happiness
concerning
valancourt
and
what
depressing
fears
had
assailed
her
the
very
words
she
had
uttered
as
she
withdrew
her
last
look
from
the
prospect
came
to
her
memory
â€œcould
i
but
be
certainâ€
she
had
then
said
â€œthat
i
should
ever
return
and
that
valancourt
would
still
live
for
meâ€”i
should
go
in
peaceâ€
now
that
futurity
so
anxiously
anticipated
was
arrived
she
was
returnedâ€”but
what
a
dreary
blank
appearedâ€”valancourt
no
longer
lived
for
her
she
had
no
longer
even
the
melancholy
satisfaction
of
contemplating
his
image
in
her
heart
for
he
was
no
longer
the
same
valancourt
she
had
cherished
thereâ€”the
solace
of
many
a
mournful
hour
the
animating
friend
that
had
enabled
her
to
bear
up
against
the
oppression
of
montoniâ€”the
distant
hope
that
had
beamed
over
her
gloomy
prospect
on
perceiving
this
beloved
idea
to
be
an
illusion
of
her
own
creation
valancourt
seemed
to
be
annihilated
and
her
soul
sickened
at
the
blank
that
remained
his
marriage
with
a
rival
even
his
death
she
thought
she
could
have
endured
with
more
fortitude
than
this
discovery
for
then
amidst
all
her
grief
she
could
have
looked
in
secret
upon
the
image
of
goodness
which
her
fancy
had
drawn
of
him
and
comfort
would
have
mingled
with
her
suffering
drying
her
tears
she
looked
once
more
upon
the
landscape
which
had
excited
them
and
perceived
that
she
was
passing
the
very
bank
where
she
had
taken
leave
of
valancourt
on
the
morning
of
her
departure
from
thoulouse
and
she
now
saw
him
through
her
returning
tears
such
as
he
had
appeared
when
she
looked
from
the
carriage
to
give
him
a
last
adieuâ€”saw
him
leaning
mournfully
against
the
high
trees
and
remembered
the
fixed
look
of
mingled
tenderness
and
anguish
with
which
he
had
then
regarded
her
this
recollection
was
too
much
for
her
heart
and
she
sunk
back
in
the
carriage
nor
once
looked
up
till
it
stopped
at
the
gates
of
what
was
now
her
own
mansion
these
being
opened
and
by
the
servant
to
whose
care
the
chã¢teau
had
been
entrusted
the
carriage
drove
into
the
court
where
alighting
she
hastily
passed
through
the
great
hall
now
silent
and
solitary
to
a
large
oak
parlour
the
common
sitting
room
of
the
late
madame
montoni
where
instead
of
being
received
by
m
quesnel
she
found
a
letter
from
him
informing
her
that
business
of
consequence
had
obliged
him
to
leave
thoulouse
two
days
before
emily
was
upon
the
whole
not
sorry
to
be
spared
his
presence
since
his
abrupt
departure
appeared
to
indicate
the
same
indifference
with
which
he
had
formerly
regarded
her
this
letter
informed
her
also
of
the
progress
he
had
made
in
the
settlement
of
her
affairs
and
concluded
with
directions
concerning
the
forms
of
some
business
which
remained
for
her
to
transact
but
m
quesnelâ€™s
unkindness
did
not
long
occupy
her
thoughts
which
returned
the
remembrance
of
the
persons
she
had
been
accustomed
to
see
in
this
mansion
and
chiefly
of
the
ill-guided
and
unfortunate
madame
montoni
in
the
room
where
she
now
sat
she
had
breakfasted
with
her
on
the
morning
of
their
departure
for
italy
and
the
view
of
it
brought
most
forcibly
to
her
recollection
all
she
had
herself
suffered
at
that
time
and
the
many
gay
expectations
which
her
aunt
had
formed
respecting
the
journey
before
her
while
emilyâ€™s
mind
was
thus
engaged
her
eyes
wandered
unconsciously
to
a
large
window
that
looked
upon
the
garden
and
here
new
memorials
of
the
past
spoke
to
her
heart
for
she
saw
extended
before
her
the
very
avenue
in
which
she
had
parted
with
valancourt
on
the
eve
of
her
journey
and
all
the
anxiety
the
tender
interest
he
had
shown
concerning
her
future
happiness
his
earnest
remonstrances
against
her
committing
herself
to
the
power
of
montoni
and
the
truth
of
his
affection
came
afresh
to
her
memory
at
this
moment
it
appeared
almost
impossible
that
valancourt
could
have
become
unworthy
of
her
regard
and
she
doubted
all
that
she
had
lately
heard
to
his
disadvantage
and
even
his
own
words
which
had
confirmed
count
de
villefortâ€™s
report
of
him
overcome
by
the
recollections
which
the
view
of
this
avenue
occasioned
she
turned
abruptly
from
the
window
and
sunk
into
a
chair
beside
it
where
she
sat
given
up
to
grief
till
the
entrance
of
annette
with
coffee
aroused
her
â€œdear
madam
how
melancholy
this
place
looks
nowâ€
said
annette
â€œto
what
it
used
to
do
it
is
dismal
coming
home
when
there
is
nobody
to
welcome
oneâ€
this
was
not
the
moment
in
which
emily
could
bear
the
remark
her
tears
fell
again
and
as
soon
as
she
had
taken
the
coffee
she
retired
to
her
apartment
where
she
endeavoured
to
repose
her
fatigued
spirits
but
busy
memory
would
still
supply
her
with
the
visions
of
former
times
she
saw
valancourt
interesting
and
benevolent
as
he
had
been
wont
to
appear
in
the
days
of
their
early
love
and
amidst
the
scenes
where
she
had
believed
that
they
should
sometimes
pass
their
years
togetherâ€”but
at
length
sleep
closed
these
afflicting
scenes
from
her
view
on
the
following
morning
serious
occupation
recovered
her
from
such
melancholy
reflections
for
being
desirous
of
quitting
thoulouse
and
of
hastening
on
to
la
vallã©e
she
made
some
enquiries
into
the
condition
of
the
estate
and
immediately
dispatched
a
part
of
the
necessary
business
concerning
it
according
to
the
directions
of
mons
quesnel
it
required
a
strong
effort
to
abstract
her
thoughts
from
other
interests
sufficiently
to
attend
to
this
but
she
was
rewarded
for
her
exertions
by
again
experiencing
that
employment
is
the
surest
antidote
to
sorrow
this
day
was
devoted
entirely
to
business
and
among
other
concerns
she
employed
means
to
learn
the
situation
of
all
her
poor
tenants
that
she
might
relieve
their
wants
or
confirm
their
comforts
in
the
evening
her
spirits
were
so
much
strengthened
that
she
thought
she
could
bear
to
visit
the
gardens
where
she
had
so
often
walked
with
valancourt
and
knowing
that
if
she
delayed
to
do
so
their
scenes
would
only
affect
her
the
more
whenever
they
should
be
viewed
she
took
advantage
of
the
present
state
of
her
mind
and
entered
them
passing
hastily
the
gate
leading
from
the
court
into
the
gardens
she
hurried
up
the
great
avenue
scarcely
permitting
her
memory
to
dwell
for
a
moment
on
the
circumstance
of
her
having
here
parted
with
valancourt
and
soon
quitted
this
for
other
walks
less
interesting
to
her
heart
these
brought
her
at
length
to
the
flight
of
steps
that
led
from
the
lower
garden
to
the
terrace
on
seeing
which
she
became
agitated
and
hesitated
whether
to
ascend
but
her
resolution
returning
she
proceeded
â€œahâ€
said
emily
as
she
ascended
â€œthese
are
the
same
high
trees
that
used
to
wave
over
the
terrace
and
these
the
same
flowery
thicketsâ€”the
liburnum
the
wild
rose
and
the
cerintheâ€”which
were
wont
to
grow
beneath
them
ah
and
there
too
on
that
bank
are
the
very
plants
which
valancourt
so
carefully
rearedâ€”o
when
last
i
saw
themâ€â€”she
checked
the
thought
but
could
not
restrain
her
tears
and
after
walking
slowly
on
for
a
few
moments
her
agitation
upon
the
view
of
this
well-known
scene
increased
so
much
that
she
was
obliged
to
stop
and
lean
upon
the
wall
of
the
terrace
it
was
a
mild
and
beautiful
evening
the
sun
was
setting
over
the
extensive
landscape
to
which
his
beams
sloping
from
beneath
a
dark
cloud
that
overhung
the
west
gave
rich
and
partial
colouring
and
touched
the
tufted
summits
of
the
groves
that
rose
from
the
garden
below
with
a
yellow
gleam
emily
and
valancourt
had
often
admired
together
this
scene
at
the
same
hour
and
it
was
exactly
on
this
spot
that
on
the
night
preceding
her
departure
for
italy
she
had
listened
to
his
remonstrances
against
the
journey
and
to
the
pleadings
of
passionate
affection
some
observations
which
she
made
on
the
landscape
brought
this
to
her
remembrance
and
with
it
all
the
minute
particulars
of
that
conversationâ€”the
alarming
doubts
he
had
expressed
concerning
montoni
doubts
which
had
since
been
fatally
confirmed
the
reasons
and
entreaties
he
had
employed
to
prevail
with
her
to
consent
to
an
immediate
marriage
the
tenderness
of
his
love
the
paroxysms
of
this
grief
and
the
conviction
that
he
had
repeatedly
expressed
that
they
should
never
meet
again
in
happiness
all
these
circumstances
rose
afresh
to
her
mind
and
awakened
the
various
emotions
she
had
then
suffered
her
tenderness
for
valancourt
became
as
powerful
as
in
the
moments
when
she
thought
that
she
was
parting
with
him
and
happiness
together
and
when
the
strength
of
her
mind
had
enabled
her
to
triumph
over
present
suffering
rather
than
to
deserve
the
reproach
of
her
conscience
by
engaging
in
a
clandestine
marriageâ€”â€œalasâ€
said
emily
as
these
recollections
came
to
her
mind
â€œand
what
have
i
gained
by
the
fortitude
i
then
practisedâ€”am
i
happy
nowâ€”he
said
we
should
meet
no
more
in
happiness
but
o
he
little
thought
his
own
misconduct
would
separate
us
and
lead
to
the
very
evil
he
then
dreadedâ€
her
reflections
increased
her
anguish
while
she
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
the
fortitude
she
had
formerly
exerted
if
it
had
not
conducted
her
to
happiness
had
saved
her
from
irretrievable
misfortuneâ€”from
valancourt
himself
but
in
these
moments
she
could
not
congratulate
herself
on
the
prudence
that
had
saved
her
she
could
only
lament
with
bitterest
anguish
the
circumstances
which
had
conspired
to
betray
valancourt
into
a
course
of
life
so
different
from
that
which
the
virtues
the
tastes
and
the
pursuits
of
his
early
years
had
promised
but
she
still
loved
him
too
well
to
believe
that
his
heart
was
even
now
depraved
though
his
conduct
had
been
criminal
an
observation
which
had
fallen
from
m
st
aubert
more
than
once
now
occurred
to
her
â€œthis
young
manâ€
said
he
speaking
of
valancourt
â€œhas
never
been
at
parisâ€
a
remark
that
had
surprised
her
at
the
time
it
was
uttered
but
which
she
now
understood
and
she
exclaimed
sorrowfully
â€œo
valancourt
if
such
a
friend
as
my
father
had
been
with
you
at
parisâ€”your
noble
ingenuous
nature
would
not
have
fallenâ€
the
sun
was
now
set
and
recalling
her
thoughts
from
their
melancholy
subject
she
continued
her
walk
for
the
pensive
shade
of
twilight
was
pleasing
to
her
and
the
nightingales
from
the
surrounding
groves
began
to
answer
each
other
in
the
long-drawn
plaintive
note
which
always
touched
her
heart
while
all
the
fragrance
of
the
flowery
thickets
that
bounded
the
terrace
was
awakened
by
the
cool
evening
air
which
floated
so
lightly
among
their
leaves
that
they
scarcely
trembled
as
it
passed
emily
came
at
length
to
the
steps
of
the
pavilion
that
terminated
the
terrace
and
where
her
last
interview
with
valancourt
before
her
departure
from
thoulouse
had
so
unexpectedly
taken
place
the
door
was
now
shut
and
she
trembled
while
she
hesitated
whether
to
open
it
but
her
wish
to
see
again
a
place
which
had
been
the
chief
scene
of
her
former
happiness
at
length
overcoming
her
reluctance
to
encounter
the
painful
regret
it
would
renew
she
entered
the
room
was
obscured
by
a
melancholy
shade
but
through
the
open
lattices
darkened
by
the
hanging
foliage
of
the
vines
appeared
the
dusky
landscape
the
garonne
reflecting
the
evening
light
and
the
west
still
glowing
a
chair
was
placed
near
one
of
the
balconies
as
if
some
person
had
been
sitting
there
but
the
other
furniture
of
the
pavilion
remained
exactly
as
usual
and
emily
thought
it
looked
as
if
it
had
not
once
been
moved
since
she
set
out
for
italy
the
silent
and
deserted
air
of
the
place
added
solemnity
to
her
emotions
for
she
heard
only
the
low
whisper
of
the
breeze
as
it
shook
the
leaves
of
the
vines
and
the
very
faint
murmur
of
the
garonne
she
seated
herself
in
a
chair
near
the
lattice
and
yielded
to
the
sadness
of
her
heart
while
she
recollected
the
circumstances
of
her
parting
interview
with
valancourt
on
this
spot
it
was
here
too
that
she
had
passed
some
of
the
happiest
hours
of
her
life
with
him
when
her
aunt
favoured
the
connection
for
here
she
had
often
sat
and
worked
while
he
conversed
or
read
and
she
now
well
remembered
with
what
discriminating
judgment
with
what
tempered
energy
he
used
to
repeat
some
of
the
sublimest
passages
of
their
favourite
authors
how
often
he
would
pause
to
admire
with
her
their
excellence
and
with
what
tender
delight
he
would
listen
to
her
remarks
and
correct
her
taste
â€œand
is
it
possibleâ€
said
emily
as
these
recollections
returnedâ€”â€œis
it
possible
that
a
mind
so
susceptible
of
whatever
is
grand
and
beautiful
could
stoop
to
low
pursuits
and
be
subdued
by
frivolous
temptationsâ€
she
remembered
how
often
she
had
seen
the
sudden
tear
start
in
his
eye
and
had
heard
his
voice
tremble
with
emotion
while
he
related
any
great
or
benevolent
action
or
repeated
a
sentiment
of
the
same
character
â€œand
such
a
mindâ€
said
she
â€œsuch
a
heart
were
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
habits
of
a
great
cityâ€
these
recollections
becoming
too
painful
to
be
endured
she
abruptly
left
the
pavilion
and
anxious
to
escape
from
the
memorials
of
her
departed
happiness
returned
towards
the
chã¢teau
as
she
passed
along
the
terrace
she
perceived
a
person
walking
with
a
slow
step
and
a
dejected
air
under
the
trees
at
some
distance
the
twilight
which
was
now
deep
would
not
allow
her
to
distinguish
who
it
was
and
she
imagined
it
to
be
one
of
the
servants
till
the
sound
of
her
steps
seeming
to
reach
him
he
turned
half
round
and
she
thought
she
saw
valancourt
whoever
it
was
he
instantly
struck
among
the
thickets
on
the
left
and
disappeared
while
emily
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
place
whence
he
had
vanished
and
her
frame
trembling
so
excessively
that
she
could
scarcely
support
herself
remained
for
some
moments
unable
to
quit
the
spot
and
scarcely
conscious
of
existence
with
her
recollection
her
strength
returned
and
she
hurried
toward
the
house
where
she
did
not
venture
to
enquire
who
had
been
in
the
gardens
lest
she
should
betray
her
emotion
and
she
sat
down
alone
endeavouring
to
recollect
the
figure
air
and
features
of
the
person
she
had
just
seen
her
view
of
him
however
had
been
so
transient
and
the
gloom
had
rendered
it
so
imperfect
that
she
could
remember
nothing
with
exactness
yet
the
general
appearance
of
his
figure
and
his
abrupt
departure
made
her
still
believe
that
this
person
was
valancourt
sometimes
indeed
she
thought
that
her
fancy
which
had
been
occupied
by
the
idea
of
him
had
suggested
his
image
to
her
uncertain
sight
but
this
conjecture
was
fleeting
if
it
was
himself
whom
she
had
seen
she
wondered
much
that
he
should
be
at
thoulouse
and
more
how
he
had
gained
admittance
into
the
garden
but
as
often
as
her
impatience
prompted
her
to
enquire
whether
any
stranger
had
been
admitted
she
was
restrained
by
an
unwillingness
to
betray
her
doubts
and
the
evening
was
passed
in
anxious
conjecture
and
in
efforts
to
dismiss
the
subject
from
her
thoughts
but
these
endeavours
were
ineffectual
and
a
thousand
inconsistent
emotions
assailed
her
whenever
she
fancied
that
valancourt
might
be
near
her
now
she
dreaded
it
to
be
true
and
now
she
feared
it
to
be
false
and
while
she
constantly
tried
to
persuade
herself
that
she
wished
the
person
whom
she
had
seen
might
not
be
valancourt
her
heart
as
constantly
contradicted
her
reason
the
following
day
was
occupied
by
the
visits
of
several
neighbouring
families
formerly
intimate
with
madame
montoni
who
came
to
condole
with
emily
on
her
death
to
congratulate
her
upon
the
acquisition
of
these
estates
and
to
enquire
about
montoni
and
concerning
the
strange
reports
they
had
heard
of
her
own
situation
all
which
was
done
with
the
utmost
decorum
and
the
visitors
departed
with
as
much
composure
as
they
had
arrived
emily
was
wearied
by
these
formalities
and
disgusted
by
the
subservient
manners
of
many
persons
who
had
thought
her
scarcely
worthy
of
common
attention
while
she
was
believed
to
be
a
dependant
on
madame
montoni
â€œsurelyâ€
said
she
â€œthere
is
some
magic
in
wealth
which
can
thus
make
persons
pay
their
court
to
it
when
it
does
not
even
benefit
themselves
how
strange
it
is
that
a
fool
or
a
knave
with
riches
should
be
treated
with
more
respect
by
the
world
than
a
good
man
or
a
wise
man
in
povertyâ€
it
was
evening
before
she
was
left
alone
and
she
then
wished
to
have
refreshed
her
spirits
in
the
free
air
of
her
garden
but
she
feared
to
go
thither
lest
she
should
meet
again
the
person
whom
she
had
seen
on
the
preceding
night
and
he
should
prove
to
be
valancourt
the
suspense
and
anxiety
she
suffered
on
this
subject
she
found
all
her
efforts
unable
to
control
and
her
secret
wish
to
see
valancourt
once
more
though
unseen
by
him
powerfully
prompted
her
to
go
but
prudence
and
a
delicate
pride
restrained
her
and
she
determined
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
throwing
herself
in
his
way
by
forbearing
to
visit
the
gardens
for
several
days
when
after
near
a
week
she
again
ventured
thither
she
made
annette
her
companion
and
confined
her
walk
to
the
lower
grounds
but
often
started
as
the
leaves
rustled
in
the
breeze
imagining
that
some
person
was
among
the
thickets
and
at
the
turn
of
every
alley
she
looked
forward
with
apprehensive
expectation
she
pursued
her
walk
thoughtfully
and
silently
for
her
agitation
would
not
suffer
her
to
converse
with
annette
to
whom
however
thought
and
silence
were
so
intolerable
that
she
did
not
scruple
at
length
to
talk
to
her
mistress
â€œdear
madamâ€
said
she
â€œwhy
do
you
start
so
one
would
think
you
knew
what
has
happenedâ€
â€œwhat
has
happenedâ€
said
emily
in
a
faltering
voice
and
trying
to
command
her
emotion
â€œthe
night
before
last
you
know
madamâ€”â€
â€œi
know
nothing
annetteâ€
replied
her
lady
in
a
more
hurried
voice
â€œthe
night
before
last
madam
there
was
a
robber
in
the
gardenâ€
â€œa
robberâ€
said
emily
in
an
eager
yet
doubting
tone
â€œi
suppose
he
was
a
robber
madam
what
else
could
he
beâ€
â€œwhere
did
you
see
him
annetteâ€
rejoined
emily
looking
round
her
and
turning
back
towards
the
chã¢teau
â€œit
was
not
i
that
saw
him
madam
it
was
jean
the
gardener
it
was
twelve
oâ€™clock
at
night
and
as
he
was
coming
across
the
court
to
go
the
back
way
into
the
house
what
should
he
seeâ€”but
somebody
walking
in
the
avenue
that
fronts
the
garden
gate
so
with
that
jean
guessed
how
it
was
and
he
went
into
the
house
for
his
gunâ€
â€œhis
gunâ€
exclaimed
emily
â€œyes
madam
his
gun
and
then
he
came
out
into
the
court
to
watch
him
presently
he
sees
him
come
slowly
down
the
avenue
and
lean
over
the
garden
gate
and
look
up
at
the
house
for
a
long
time
and
i
warrant
he
examined
it
well
and
settled
what
window
he
should
break
in
atâ€
â€œbut
the
gunâ€
said
emilyâ€”â€œthe
gunâ€
â€œyes
madam
all
in
good
time
presently
jean
says
the
robber
opened
the
gate
and
was
coming
into
the
court
and
then
he
thought
proper
to
ask
him
his
business
so
he
called
out
again
and
bade
him
say
who
he
was
and
what
he
wanted
but
the
man
would
do
neither
but
turned
upon
his
heel
and
passed
into
the
garden
again
jean
knew
then
well
enough
how
it
was
and
so
he
fired
after
himâ€
â€œfiredâ€
exclaimed
emily
â€œyes
madam
fired
off
his
gun
but
holy
virgin
what
makes
you
look
so
pale
madam
the
man
was
not
killedâ€”i
dare
say
but
if
he
was
his
comrades
carried
him
off
for
when
jean
went
in
the
morning
to
look
for
the
body
it
was
gone
and
nothing
to
be
seen
but
a
track
of
blood
on
the
ground
jean
followed
it
that
he
might
find
out
where
the
man
got
into
the
garden
but
it
was
lost
in
the
grass
andâ€”â€
annette
was
interrupted
for
emilyâ€™s
spirits
died
away
and
she
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
if
the
girl
had
not
caught
her
and
supported
her
to
a
bench
close
to
them
when
after
a
long
absence
her
senses
returned
emily
desired
to
be
led
to
her
apartment
and
though
she
trembled
with
anxiety
to
enquire
further
on
the
subject
of
her
alarm
she
found
herself
too
ill
at
present
to
dare
the
intelligence
which
it
was
possible
she
might
receive
of
valancourt
having
dismissed
annette
that
she
might
weep
and
think
at
liberty
she
endeavoured
to
recollect
the
exact
air
of
the
person
whom
she
had
seen
on
the
terrace
and
still
her
fancy
gave
her
the
figure
of
valancourt
she
had
indeed
scarcely
a
doubt
that
it
was
he
whom
she
had
seen
and
at
whom
the
gardener
had
fired
for
the
manner
of
the
latter
person
as
described
by
annette
was
not
that
of
a
robber
nor
did
it
appear
probable
that
a
robber
would
have
come
alone
to
break
into
a
house
so
spacious
as
this
when
emily
thought
herself
sufficiently
recovered
to
listen
to
what
jean
might
have
to
relate
she
sent
for
him
but
he
could
inform
her
of
no
circumstance
that
might
lead
to
a
knowledge
of
the
person
who
had
been
shot
or
of
the
consequence
of
the
wound
and
after
severely
reprimanding
him
for
having
fired
with
bullets
and
ordering
diligent
enquiry
to
be
made
in
the
neighbourhood
for
the
discovery
of
the
wounded
person
she
dismissed
him
and
herself
remained
in
the
same
state
of
terrible
suspense
all
the
tenderness
she
had
ever
felt
for
valancourt
was
recalled
by
the
sense
of
his
danger
and
the
more
she
considered
the
subject
the
more
her
conviction
strengthened
that
it
was
he
who
had
visited
the
gardens
for
the
purpose
of
soothing
the
misery
of
disappointed
affection
amidst
the
scenes
of
his
former
happiness
â€œdear
madamâ€
said
annette
when
she
returned
â€œi
never
saw
you
so
affected
before
i
dare
say
the
man
is
not
killedâ€
emily
shuddered
and
lamented
bitterly
the
rashness
of
the
gardener
in
having
fired
â€œi
knew
you
would
be
angry
enough
about
that
madam
or
i
should
have
told
you
before
and
he
knew
so
too
for
says
he
â€˜annette
say
nothing
about
this
to
my
lady
she
lies
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
so
did
not
hear
the
gun
perhaps
but
she
would
be
angry
with
me
if
she
knew
seeing
there
is
blood
but
thenâ€™
says
he
â€˜how
is
one
to
keep
the
garden
clear
if
one
is
afraid
to
fire
at
a
robber
when
one
sees
himâ€™â€
â€œno
more
of
thisâ€
said
emily
â€œpray
leave
meâ€
annette
obeyed
and
emily
returned
to
the
agonizing
considerations
that
had
assailed
her
before
but
which
she
at
length
endeavoured
to
sooth
by
a
new
remark
if
the
stranger
was
valancourt
it
was
certain
he
had
come
alone
and
it
appeared
therefore
that
he
had
been
able
to
quit
the
gardens
without
assistance
a
circumstance
which
did
not
seem
probable
had
his
wound
been
dangerous
with
this
consideration
she
endeavoured
to
support
herself
during
the
enquiries
that
were
making
by
her
servants
in
the
neighbourhood
but
day
after
day
came
and
still
closed
in
uncertainty
concerning
this
affair
and
emily
suffering
in
silence
at
length
drooped
and
sunk
under
the
pressure
of
her
anxiety
she
was
attacked
by
a
slow
fever
and
when
she
yielded
to
the
persuasion
of
annette
to
send
for
medical
advice
the
physicians
prescribed
little
beside
air
gentle
exercise
and
amusement
but
how
was
this
last
to
be
obtained
she
however
endeavoured
to
abstract
her
thoughts
from
the
subject
of
her
anxiety
by
employing
them
in
promoting
that
happiness
in
others
which
she
had
lost
herself
and
when
the
evening
was
fine
she
usually
took
an
airing
including
in
her
ride
the
cottages
of
some
of
her
tenants
on
whose
condition
she
made
such
observations
as
often
enabled
her
unasked
to
fulfil
their
wishes
her
indisposition
and
the
business
she
engaged
in
relative
to
this
estate
had
already
protracted
her
stay
at
thoulouse
beyond
the
period
she
had
formerly
fixed
for
her
departure
to
la
vallã©e
and
now
she
was
unwilling
to
leave
the
only
place
where
it
seemed
possible
that
certainty
could
be
obtained
on
the
subject
of
her
distress
but
the
time
was
come
when
her
presence
was
necessary
at
la
vallã©e
a
letter
from
the
lady
blanche
now
informing
her
that
the
count
and
herself
being
then
at
the
chã¢teau
of
the
baron
st
foix
purposed
to
visit
her
at
la
vallã©e
on
their
way
home
as
soon
as
they
should
be
informed
of
her
arrival
there
blanche
added
that
they
made
this
visit
with
the
hope
of
inducing
her
to
return
with
them
to
chã¢teau-le-blanc
emily
having
replied
to
the
letter
of
her
friend
and
said
that
she
should
be
at
la
vallã©e
in
a
few
days
made
hasty
preparations
for
the
journey
and
in
thus
leaving
thoulouse
endeavoured
to
support
herself
with
a
belief
that
if
any
fatal
accident
had
happened
to
valancourt
she
must
in
this
interval
have
heard
of
it
on
the
evening
before
her
departure
she
went
to
take
leave
of
the
terrace
and
the
pavilion
the
day
had
been
sultry
but
a
light
shower
that
fell
just
before
sunset
had
cooled
the
air
and
given
that
soft
verdure
to
the
woods
and
pastures
which
is
so
refreshing
to
the
eye
while
the
rain
drops
still
trembling
on
the
shrubs
glittered
in
the
last
yellow
gleam
that
lighted
up
the
scene
and
the
air
was
filled
with
fragrance
exhaled
by
the
late
shower
from
herbs
and
flowers
and
from
the
earth
itself
but
the
lovely
prospect
which
emily
beheld
from
the
terrace
was
no
longer
viewed
by
her
with
delight
she
sighed
deeply
as
her
eye
wandered
over
it
and
her
spirits
were
in
a
state
of
such
dejection
that
she
could
not
think
of
her
approaching
return
to
la
vallã©e
without
tears
and
seemed
to
mourn
again
the
death
of
her
father
as
if
it
had
been
an
event
of
yesterday
having
reached
the
pavilion
she
seated
herself
at
the
open
lattice
and
while
her
eyes
settled
on
the
distant
mountains
that
overlooked
gascony
still
gleaming
on
the
horizon
though
the
sun
had
now
left
the
plains
below
â€œalasâ€
said
she
â€œi
return
to
your
long-lost
scenes
but
shall
meet
no
more
the
parents
that
were
wont
to
render
them
delightfulâ€”no
more
shall
see
the
smile
of
welcome
or
hear
the
well-known
voice
of
fondnessâ€”all
will
now
be
cold
and
silent
in
what
was
once
my
happy
homeâ€
tears
stole
down
her
cheek
as
the
remembrance
of
what
that
home
had
been
returned
to
her
but
after
indulging
her
sorrow
for
some
time
she
checked
it
accusing
herself
of
ingratitude
in
forgetting
the
friends
that
she
possessed
while
she
lamented
those
that
were
departed
and
she
at
length
left
the
pavilion
and
the
terrace
without
having
observed
a
shadow
of
valancourt
or
of
any
other
person
ah
happy
hills
ah
pleasing
shade
ah
fields
belovâ€™d
in
vain
where
once
my
careless
childhood
strayâ€™d
a
stranger
yet
to
pain
i
feel
the
gales
that
from
ye
blow
a
momentary
bliss
bestow
as
waving
fresh
their
gladsome
wing
my
weary
soul
they
seem
to
sooth
gray
on
the
following
morning
emily
left
thoulouse
at
an
early
hour
and
reached
la
vallã©e
about
sunset
with
the
melancholy
she
experienced
on
the
review
of
a
place
which
had
been
the
residence
of
her
parents
and
the
scene
of
her
earliest
delight
was
mingled
after
the
first
shock
had
subsided
a
tender
and
undescribable
pleasure
for
time
had
so
far
blunted
the
acuteness
of
her
grief
that
she
now
courted
every
scene
that
awakened
the
memory
of
her
friends
in
every
room
where
she
had
been
accustomed
to
see
them
they
almost
seemed
to
live
again
and
she
felt
that
la
vallã©e
was
still
her
happiest
home
one
of
the
first
apartments
she
visited
was
that
which
had
been
her
fatherâ€™s
library
and
here
she
seated
herself
in
his
arm-chair
and
while
she
contemplated
with
tempered
resignation
the
picture
of
past
times
which
her
memory
gave
the
tears
she
shed
could
scarcely
be
called
those
of
grief
soon
after
her
arrival
she
was
surprised
by
a
visit
from
the
venerable
m
barreaux
who
came
impatiently
to
welcome
the
daughter
of
his
late
respected
neighbour
to
her
long-deserted
home
emily
was
comforted
by
the
presence
of
an
old
friend
and
they
passed
an
interesting
hour
in
conversing
of
former
times
and
in
relating
some
of
the
circumstances
that
had
occurred
to
each
since
they
parted
the
evening
was
so
far
advanced
when
m
barreaux
left
emily
that
she
could
not
visit
the
garden
that
night
but
on
the
following
morning
she
traced
its
long-regretted
scenes
with
fond
impatience
and
as
she
walked
beneath
the
groves
which
her
father
had
planted
and
where
she
had
so
often
sauntered
in
affectionate
conversation
with
him
his
countenance
his
smile
even
the
accents
of
his
voice
returned
with
exactness
to
her
fancy
and
her
heart
melted
to
the
tender
recollections
this
too
was
his
favourite
season
of
the
year
at
which
they
had
often
together
admired
the
rich
and
variegated
tints
of
these
woods
and
the
magical
effect
of
autumnal
lights
upon
the
mountains
and
now
the
view
of
these
circumstances
made
memory
eloquent
as
she
wandered
pensively
on
she
fancied
the
following
address
to
autumn
sweet
autumn
how
thy
melancholy
grace
steals
on
my
heart
as
through
these
shades
i
wind
soothâ€™d
by
thy
breathing
sigh
i
fondly
trace
each
lonely

the

the

tear
that

more

as

thy

the
varied
man
one
of
emilyâ€™s
earliest
enquiries
after
her
arrival
at
la
vallã©e
was
concerning
theresa
her
fatherâ€™s
old
servant
whom
it
may
be
remembered
that
m
quesnel
had
turned
from
the
house
when
it
was
let
without
any
provision
understanding
that
she
lived
in
a
cottage
at
no
great
distance
emily
walked
thither
and
on
approaching
was
pleased
to
see
that
her
habitation
was
pleasantly
situated
on
a
green
slope
sheltered
by
a
tuft
of
oaks
and
had
an
appearance
of
comfort
and
extreme
neatness
she
found
the
old
woman
within
picking
vine-stalks
who
on
perceiving
her
young
mistress
was
nearly
overcome
with
joy
â€œah
my
dear
young
ladyâ€
said
she
â€œi
thought
i
should
never
see
you
again
in
this
world
when
i
heard
you
were
gone
to
that
outlandish
country
i
have
been
hardly
used
since
you
went
i
little
thought
they
would
have
turned
me
out
of
my
old
masterâ€™s
family
in
my
old
ageâ€
emily
lamented
the
circumstance
and
then
assured
her
that
she
would
make
her
latter
days
comfortable
and
expressed
satisfaction
on
seeing
her
in
so
pleasant
a
habitation
theresa
thanked
her
with
tears
adding
â€œyes
mademoiselle
it
is
a
very
comfortable
home
thanks
to
the
kind
friend
who
took
me
out
of
my
distress
when
you
were
too
far
off
to
help
me
and
placed
me
here
i
little
thoughtâ€”but
no
more
of
thatâ€”â€
â€œand
who
was
this
kind
friendâ€
said
emily
â€œwhoever
it
was
i
shall
consider
him
as
mine
alsoâ€
â€œah
mademoiselle
that
friend
forbade
me
to
blazon
the
good
deedâ€”i
must
not
say
who
it
was
but
how
you
are
altered
since
i
saw
you
last
you
look
so
pale
now
and
so
thin
too
but
then
there
is
my
old
masterâ€™s
smile
yes
that
will
never
leave
you
any
more
than
the
goodness
that
used
to
make
him
smile
alas-a-day
the
poor
lost
a
friend
indeed
when
he
diedâ€
emily
was
affected
by
this
mention
of
her
father
which
theresa
observing
changed
the
subject
â€œi
heard
mademoiselleâ€
said
she
â€œthat
madame
cheron
married
a
foreign
gentleman
after
all
and
took
you
abroad
how
does
she
doâ€
emily
now
mentioned
her
death
â€œalasâ€
said
theresa
â€œif
she
had
not
been
my
masterâ€™s
sister
i
should
never
have
loved
her
she
was
always
so
cross
but
how
does
that
dear
young
gentleman
do
m
valancourt
he
was
a
handsome
youth
and
a
good
one
is
he
well
mademoiselleâ€
emily
was
much
agitated
â€œa
blessing
on
himâ€
continued
theresa
â€œah
my
dear
young
lady
you
need
not
look
so
shy
i
know
all
about
it
do
you
think
i
do
not
know
that
he
loves
you
why
when
you
were
away
mademoiselle
he
used
to
come
to
the
chã¢teau
and
walk
about
it
so
disconsolate
he
would
go
into
every
room
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
and
sometimes
he
would
sit
himself
down
in
a
chair
with
his
arms
across
and
his
eyes
on
the
floor
and
there
he
would
sit
and
think
and
think
for
the
hour
together
he
used
to
be
very
fond
of
the
south
parlour
because
i
told
him
it
used
to
be
yours
and
there
he
would
stay
looking
at
the
pictures
which
i
said
you
drew
and
playing
upon
your
lute
that
hung
up
by
the
window
and
reading
in
your
books
till
sunset
and
then
he
must
go
back
to
his
brotherâ€™s
chã¢teau
and
thenâ€”â€
â€œit
is
enough
theresaâ€
said
emilyâ€”â€œhow
long
have
you
lived
in
this
cottageâ€”and
how
can
i
serve
you
will
you
remain
here
or
return
and
live
with
meâ€
â€œnay
mademoiselleâ€
said
theresa
â€œdo
not
be
so
shy
to
your
poor
old
servant
i
am
sure
it
is
no
disgrace
to
like
such
a
good
young
gentlemanâ€
a
deep
sigh
escaped
from
emily
â€œah
how
he
did
love
to
talk
of
you
i
loved
him
for
that
nay
for
that
matter
he
liked
to
hear
me
talk
for
he
did
not
say
much
himself
but
i
soon
found
out
what
he
came
to
the
chã¢teau
about
then
he
would
go
into
the
garden
and
down
to
the
terrace
and
sit
under
that
great
tree
there
for
the
day
together
with
one
of
your
books
in
his
hand
but
he
did
not
read
much
i
fancy
for
one
day
i
happened
to
go
that
way
and
i
heard
somebody
talking
who
can
be
here
says
i
i
am
sure
i
let
nobody
into
the
garden
but
the
chevalier
so
i
walked
softly
to
see
who
it
could
be
and
behold
it
was
the
chevalier
himself
talking
to
himself
about
you
and
he
repeated
your
name
and
sighed
so
and
said
he
had
lost
you
for
ever
for
that
you
would
never
return
for
him
i
thought
he
was
out
in
his
reckoning
there
but
i
said
nothing
and
stole
awayâ€
â€œno
more
of
this
triflingâ€
said
emily
awakening
from
her
reverie
â€œit
displeases
meâ€
â€œbut
when
m
quesnel
let
the
chã¢teau
i
thought
it
would
have
broke
the
chevalierâ€™s
heartâ€
â€œtheresaâ€
said
emily
seriously
â€œyou
must
name
the
chevalier
no
moreâ€
â€œnot
name
him
mademoiselleâ€
cried
theresa
â€œwhat
times
are
come
up
now
why
i
love
the
chevalier
next
to
my
old
master
and
you
mademoiselleâ€
â€œperhaps
your
love
was
not
well
bestowed
thenâ€
replied
emily
trying
to
conceal
her
tears
â€œbut
however
that
might
be
we
shall
meet
no
moreâ€
â€œmeet
no
moreâ€”not
well
bestowedâ€
exclaimed
theresa
â€œwhat
do
i
hear
no
mademoiselle
my
love
was
well
bestowed
for
it
was
the
chevalier
valancourt
who
gave
me
this
cottage
and
has
supported
me
in
my
old
age
ever
since
m
quesnel
turned
me
from
my
masterâ€™s
houseâ€
â€œthe
chevalier
valancourtâ€
said
emily
trembling
extremely
â€œyes
mademoiselle
he
himself
though
he
made
me
promise
not
to
tell
but
how
could
one
help
when
one
heard
him
ill
spoken
of
ah
dear
young
lady
you
may
well
weep
if
you
have
behaved
unkindly
to
him
for
a
more
tender
heart
than
his
never
young
gentleman
had
he
found
me
out
in
my
distress
when
you
were
too
far
off
to
help
me
and
m
quesnel
refused
to
do
so
and
bade
me
go
to
service
againâ€”alas
i
was
too
old
for
thatâ€”the
chevalier
found
me
and
bought
me
this
cottage
and
gave
me
money
to
furnish
it
and
bade
me
seek
out
another
poor
woman
to
live
with
me
and
he
ordered
his
brotherâ€™s
steward
to
pay
me
every
quarter
that
which
has
supported
me
in
comfort
think
then
mademoiselle
whether
i
have
not
reason
to
speak
well
of
the
chevalier
and
there
are
others
who
could
have
afforded
it
better
than
he
and
i
am
afraid
he
has
hurt
himself
by
his
generosity
for
quarter
day
is
gone
by
long
since
and
no
money
for
me
but
do
not
weep
so
mademoiselle
you
are
not
sorry
surely
to
hear
of
the
poor
chevalierâ€™s
goodnessâ€
â€œsorryâ€
said
emily
and
wept
the
more
â€œbut
how
long
is
it
since
you
have
seen
himâ€
â€œnot
this
many
a
day
mademoiselleâ€
â€œwhen
did
you
hear
of
himâ€
enquired
emily
with
increased
emotion
â€œalas
never
since
he
went
away
so
suddenly
into
languedoc
and
he
was
but
just
come
from
paris
then
or
i
should
have
seen
him
i
am
sure
quarter
day
is
gone
by
long
since
and
as
i
said
no
money
for
me
and
i
begin
to
fear
some
harm
has
happened
to
him
and
if
i
was
not
so
far
from
estuviã¨re
and
so
lame
i
should
have
gone
to
enquire
before
this
time
and
i
have
nobody
to
send
so
farâ€
emilyâ€™s
anxiety
as
to
the
fate
of
valancourt
was
now
scarcely
endurable
and
since
propriety
would
not
suffer
her
to
send
to
the
chã¢teau
of
his
brother
she
requested
that
theresa
would
immediately
hire
some
person
to
go
to
his
steward
from
herself
and
when
he
asked
for
the
quarterage
due
to
her
to
make
enquiries
concerning
valancourt
but
she
first
made
theresa
promise
never
to
mention
her
name
in
this
affair
or
ever
with
that
of
the
chevalier
valancourt
and
her
former
faithfulness
to
m
st
aubert
induced
emily
to
confide
in
her
assurances
theresa
now
joyfully
undertook
to
procure
a
person
for
this
errand
and
then
emily
after
giving
her
a
sum
of
money
to
supply
her
with
present
comforts
returned
with
spirits
heavily
oppressed
to
her
home
lamenting
more
than
ever
that
a
heart
possessed
of
so
much
benevolence
as
valancourtâ€™s
should
have
been
contaminated
by
the
vices
of
the
world
but
affected
by
the
delicate
affection
which
his
kindness
to
her
old
servant
expressed
for
herself
light
thickens
and
the
crow
makes
wing
to
the
rooky
wood
good
things
of
day
begin
to
droop
and
drowse
while
nightâ€™s
black
agents
to
their
preys
do
rouse
macbeth
meanwhile
count
de
villefort
and
lady
blanche
had
passed
a
pleasant
fortnight
at
the
chã¢teau
de
st
foix
with
the
baron
and
baroness
during
which
they
made
frequent
excursions
among
the
mountains
and
were
delighted
with
the
romantic
wildness
of
pyrenean
scenery
it
was
with
regret
that
the
count
bade
adieu
to
his
old
friends
although
with
the
hope
of
being
soon
united
with
them
in
one
family
for
it
was
settled
that
m
st
foix
who
now
attended
them
into
gascony
should
receive
the
hand
of
the
lady
blanche
upon
their
arrival
at
chã¢teau-le-blanc
as
the
road
from
the
baronâ€™s
residence
to
la
vallã©e
was
over
some
of
the
wildest
tract
of
the
pyrenees
and
where
a
carriage-wheel
had
never
passed
the
count
hired
mules
for
himself
and
his
family
as
well
as
a
couple
of
stout
guides
who
were
well
armed
informed
of
all
the
passes
of
the
mountains
and
who
boasted
too
that
they
were
acquainted
with
every
brake
and
dingle
in
the
way
could
tell
the
names
of
all
the
highest
points
of
this
chain
of
alps
knew
every
forest
that
spread
along
their
narrow
valleys
the
shallowest
part
of
every
torrent
they
must
cross
and
the
exact
distance
of
every
goat-herdâ€™s
and
hunterâ€™s
cabin
they
should
have
occasion
to
passâ€”which
last
article
of
learning
required
no
very
capacious
memory
for
even
such
simple
inhabitants
were
but
thinly
scattered
over
these
wilds
the
count
left
the
chã¢teau
de
st
foix
early
in
the
morning
with
an
intention
of
passing
the
night
at
a
little
inn
upon
the
mountains
about
half
way
to
la
vallã©e
of
which
his
guides
had
informed
him
and
though
this
was
frequented
chiefly
by
spanish
muleteers
on
their
route
into
france
and
of
course
would
afford
only
sorry
accommodation
the
count
had
no
alternative
for
it
was
the
only
place
like
an
inn
on
the
road
after
a
day
of
admiration
and
fatigue
the
travellers
found
themselves
about
sunset
in
a
woody
valley
overlooked
on
every
side
by
abrupt
heights
they
had
proceeded
for
many
leagues
without
seeing
a
human
habitation
and
had
only
heard
now
and
then
at
a
distance
the
melancholy
tinkling
of
a
sheep-bell
but
now
they
caught
the
notes
of
merry
music
and
presently
saw
within
a
little
green
recess
among
the
rocks
a
group
of
mountaineers
tripping
through
a
dance
the
count
who
could
not
look
upon
the
happiness
any
more
than
on
the
misery
of
others
with
indifference
halted
to
enjoy
this
scene
of
simple
pleasure
the
group
before
him
consisted
of
french
and
spanish
peasants
the
inhabitants
of
a
neighbouring
hamlet
some
of
whom
were
performing
a
sprightly
dance
the
women
with
castanets
in
their
hands
to
the
sounds
of
a
lute
and
a
tamborine
till
from
the
brisk
melody
of
france
the
music
softened
into
a
slow
movement
to
which
two
female
peasants
danced
a
spanish
pavan
the
count
comparing
this
with
the
scenes
of
such
gaiety
as
he
had
witnessed
at
paris
where
false
taste
painted
the
features
and
while
it
vainly
tried
to
supply
the
glow
of
nature
concealed
the
charms
of
animationâ€”where
affectation
so
often
distorted
the
air
and
vice
perverted
the
mannersâ€”sighed
to
think
that
natural
graces
and
innocent
pleasures
flourished
in
the
wilds
of
solitude
while
they
drooped
amidst
the
concourse
of
polished
society
but
the
lengthening
shadows
reminded
the
travellers
that
they
had
no
time
to
lose
and
leaving
this
joyous
group
they
pursued
their
way
towards
the
little
inn
which
was
to
shelter
them
from
the
night
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
now
threw
a
yellow
gleam
upon
the
forests
of
pine
and
chesnut
that
swept
down
the
lower
region
of
the
mountains
and
gave
resplendent
tints
to
the
snowy
points
above
but
soon
even
this
light
faded
fast
and
the
scenery
assumed
a
more
tremendous
appearance
invested
with
the
obscurity
of
twilight
where
the
torrent
had
been
seen
it
was
now
only
heard
where
the
wild
cliffs
had
displayed
every
variety
of
form
and
attitude
a
dark
mass
of
mountains
now
alone
appeared
and
the
vale
which
far
far
below
had
opened
its
dreadful
chasm
the
eye
could
no
longer
fathom
a
melancholy
gleam
still
lingered
on
the
summits
of
the
highest
alps
overlooking
the
deep
repose
of
evening
and
seeming
to
make
the
stillness
of
the
hour
more
awful
blanche
viewed
the
scene
in
silence
and
listened
with
enthusiasm
to
the
murmur
of
the
pines
that
extended
in
dark
lines
along
the
mountains
and
to
the
faint
voice
of
the
izard
among
the
rocks
that
came
at
intervals
on
the
air
but
her
enthusiasm
sunk
into
apprehension
when
as
the
shadows
deepened
she
looked
upon
the
doubtful
precipice
that
bordered
the
road
as
well
as
on
the
various
fantastic
forms
of
danger
that
glimmered
through
the
obscurity
beyond
it
and
she
asked
her
father
how
far
they
were
from
the
inn
and
whether
he
did
not
consider
the
road
to
be
dangerous
at
this
late
hour
the
count
repeated
the
first
question
to
the
guides
who
returned
a
doubtful
answer
adding
that
when
it
was
darker
it
would
be
safest
to
rest
till
the
moon
rose
â€œit
is
scarcely
safe
to
proceed
nowâ€
said
the
count
but
the
guides
assuring
him
that
there
was
no
danger
went
on
blanche
revived
by
this
assurance
again
indulged
a
pensive
pleasure
as
she
watched
the
progress
of
twilight
gradually
spreading
its
tints
over
the
woods
and
mountains
and
stealing
from
the
eye
every
minuter
feature
of
the
scene
till
the
grand
outlines
of
nature
alone
remained
then
fell
the
silent
dews
and
every
wild
flower
and
aromatic
plant
that
bloomed
among
the
cliffs
breathed
forth
its
sweetness
then
too
when
the
mountain-bee
had
crept
into
its
blossomed
bed
and
the
hum
of
every
little
insect
that
had
floated
gaily
in
the
sunbeam
was
hushed
the
sound
of
many
streams

at

distanceâ€”the
bats
alone
of
all
the
animals
inhabiting
this
region
seemed
awake
and
while
they
flitted
across
the
silent
path
which
blanche
was
pursuing
she
remembered
the
following
lines
which
emily
had
given
her
to
the

from

thy

her
beaming

to
a

the

that

afford
a
higher
delight
than
the
most
distinct
scenery
that
the

can
show
while
the
fancy
thus
wanders
over
landscapes
partly
of
its

creation
a
sweet
complacency
steals
upon
the
mind
and
refines
it
all
to
subtlest
feeling
bids
the
tear
of
rapture
roll
the
distant
note
of
a
torrent
the
weak
trembling
of
the
breeze
among
the
woods
or
the
far-off
sound
of
a
human
voice
now
lost
and
heard
again
are
circumstances
which
wonderfully
heighten
the
enthusiastic
tone
of
the
mind
the
young
st
foix
who
saw
the
presentations
of
a
fervid
fancy
and
felt
whatever
enthusiasm
could
suggest
sometimes
interrupted
the
silence
which
the
rest
of
the
party
seemed
by
mutual
consent
to
preserve
remarking
and
pointing
out
to
blanche
the
most
striking
effect
of
the
hour
upon
the
scenery
while
blanche
whose
apprehensions
were
beguiled
by
the
conversation
of
her
lover
yielded
to
the
taste
so
congenial
to
his
and
they
conversed
in
a
low
restrained
voice
the
effect
of
the
pensive
tranquillity
which
twilight
and
the
scene
inspired
rather
than
of
any
fear
that
they
should
be
heard
but
while
the
heart
was
thus
soothed
to
tenderness
st
foix
gradually
mingled
with
his
admiration
of
the
country
a
mention
of
his
affection
and
he
continued
to
speak
and
blanche
to
listen
till
the
mountains
the
woods
and
the
magical
illusions
of
twilight
were
remembered
no
more
the
shadows
of
evening
soon
shifted
to
the
gloom
of
night
which
was
somewhat
anticipated
by
the
vapours
that
gathering
fast
round
the
mountains
rolled
in
dark
wreaths
along
their
sides
and
the
guides
proposed
to
rest
till
the
moon
should
rise
adding
that
they
thought
a
storm
was
coming
on
as
they
looked
round
for
a
spot
that
might
afford
some
kind
of
shelter
an
object
was
perceived
obscurely
through
the
dusk
on
a
point
of
rock
a
little
way
down
the
mountain
which
they
imagined
to
be
a
hunterâ€™s
or
a
shepherdâ€™s
cabin
and
the
party
with
cautious
steps
proceeded
towards
it
their
labour
however
was
not
rewarded
or
their
apprehensions
soothed
for
on
reaching
the
object
of
their
search
they
discovered
a
monumental
cross
which
marked
the
spot
to
have
been
polluted
by
murder
the
darkness
would
not
permit
them
to
read
the
inscription
but
the
guides
knew
this
to
be
a
cross
raised
to
the
memory
of
a
count
de
beliard
who
had
been
murdered
here
by
a
horde
of
banditti
that
had
infested
this
part
of
the
pyrenees
a
few
years
before
and
the
uncommon
size
of
the
monument
seemed
to
justify
the
supposition
that
it
was
erected
for
a
person
of
some
distinction
blanche
shuddered
as
she
listened
to
some
horrid
particulars
of
the
countâ€™s
fate
which
one
of
the
guides
related
in
a
low
restrained
tone
as
if
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
frightened
him
but
while
they
lingered
at
the
cross
attending
to
his
narrative
a
flash
of
lightning
glanced
upon
the
rocks
thunder
muttered
at
a
distance
and
the
travellers
now
alarmed
quitted
this
scene
of
solitary
horror
in
search
of
shelter
having
regained
their
former
track
the
guides
as
they
passed
on
endeavoured
to
interest
the
count
by
various
stories
of
robbery
and
even
of
murder
which
had
been
perpetrated
in
the
very
places
they
must
unavoidably
pass
with
accounts
of
their
own
dauntless
courage
and
wonderful
escapes
the
chief
guide
or
rather
he
who
was
the
most
completely
armed
drawing
forth
one
of
the
four
pistols
that
were
tucked
into
his
belt
swore
that
it
had
shot
three
robbers
within
the
year
he
then
brandished
a
clasp-knife
of
enormous
length
and
was
going
to
recount
the
wonderful
execution
it
had
done
when
st
foix
perceiving
that
blanche
was
terrified
interrupted
him
the
count
meanwhile
secretly
laughing
at
the
terrible
histories
and
extravagant
boastings
of
the
man
resolved
to
humour
him
and
telling
blanche
in
a
whisper
his
design
began
to
recount
some
exploits
of
his
own
which
infinitely
exceeded
any
related
by
the
guide
to
these
surprising
circumstances
he
so
artfully
gave
the
colouring
of
truth
that
the
courage
of
the
guides
was
visibly
affected
by
them
who
continued
silent
long
after
the
count
had
ceased
to
speak
the
loquacity
of
the
chief
hero
thus
laid
asleep
the
vigilance
of
his
eyes
and
ears
seemed
more
thoroughly
awakened
for
he
listened
with
much
appearance
of
anxiety
to
the
deep
thunder
which
murmured
at
intervals
and
often
paused
as
the
breeze
that
was
now
rising
rushed
among
the
pines
but
when
he
made
a
sudden
halt
before
a
tuft
of
cork
trees
that
projected
over
the
road
and
drew
forth
a
pistol
before
he
would
venture
to
brave
the
banditti
which
might
lurk
behind
it
the
count
could
no
longer
refrain
from
laughter
having
now
however
arrived
at
a
level
spot
somewhat
sheltered
from
the
air
by
overhanging
cliffs
and
by
a
wood
of
larch
that
rose
over
the
precipice
on
the
left
and
the
guides
being
yet
ignorant
how
far
they
were
from
the
inn
the
travellers
determined
to
rest
till
the
moon
should
rise
or
the
storm
disperse
blanche
recalled
to
a
sense
of
the
present
moment
looked
on
the
surrounding
gloom
with
terror
but
giving
her
hand
to
st
foix
she
alighted
and
the
whole
party
entered
a
kind
of
cave
if
such
it
could
be
called
which
was
only
a
shallow
cavity
formed
by
the
curve
of
impending
rocks
a
light
being
struck
a
fire
was
kindled
whose
blaze
afforded
some
degree
of
cheerfulness
and
no
small
comfort
for
though
the
day
had
been
hot
the
night
air
of
this
mountainous
region
was
chilling
a
fire
was
partly
necessary
also
to
keep
off
the
wolves
with
which
those
wilds
were
infested
provisions
being
spread
upon
a
projection
of
the
rock
the
count
and
his
family
partook
of
a
supper
which
in
a
scene
less
rude
would
certainly
have
been
thought
less
excellent
when
the
repast
was
finished
st
foix
impatient
for
the
moon
sauntered
along
the
precipice
to
a
point
that
fronted
the
east
but
all
was
yet
wrapt
in
gloom
and
the
silence
of
night
was
broken
only
by
the
murmuring
of
woods
that
waved
far
below
or
by
distant
thunder
and
now
and
then
by
the
faint
voices
of
the
party
he
had
quitted
he
viewed
with
emotions
of
awful
sublimity
the
long
volumes
of
sulphureous
clouds
that
floated
along
the
upper
and
middle
regions
of
the
air
and
the
lightnings
that
flashed
from
them
sometimes
silently
and
at
others
followed
by
sullen
peals
of
thunder
which
the
mountains
feebly
prolonged
while
the
whole
horizon
and
the
abyss
on
which
he
stood
were
discovered
in
the
momentary
light
upon
the
succeeding
darkness
the
fire
which
had
been
kindled
in
the
cave
threw
a
partial
gleam
illumining
some
points
of
the
opposite
rocks
and
the
summits
of
pine-woods
that
hung
beetling
on
the
cliffs
below
while
their
recesses
seemed
to
frown
in
deeper
shade
st
foix
stopped
to
observe
the
picture
which
the
party
in
the
cave
presented
where
the
elegant
form
of
blanche
was
finely
contrasted
by
the
majestic
figure
of
the
count
who
was
seated
by
her
on
a
rude
stone
and
each
was
rendered
more
impressive
by
the
grotesque
habits
and
strong
features
of
the
guides
and
other
attendants
who
were
in
the
back
ground
of
the
piece
the
effect
of
the
light
too
was
interesting
on
the
surrounding
figures
it
threw
a
strong
though
pale
gleam
and
glittered
on
their
bright
arms
while
upon
the
foliage
of
a
gigantic
larch
that
impended
its
shade
over
the
cliff
above
appeared
a
red
dusky
tint
deepening
almost
imperceptibly
into
the
blackness
of
night
while
st
foix
contemplated
the
scene
the
moon
broad
and
yellow
rose
over
the
eastern
summits
from
among
embattled
clouds
and
showed
dimly
the
grandeur
of
the
heavens
the
mass
of
vapours
that
rolled
half
way
down
the
precipice
beneath
and
the
doubtful
mountains
what
dreadful
pleasure
there
to
stand
sublime
like
shipwreckâ€™d
mariner
on
desert
coast
and
view
thâ€™enormous
waste
of
vapour
tost
in
billows
lengthâ€™ning
to
thâ€™horizon
round
the
minstrel
from
this
romantic
reverie
he
was
awakened
by
the
voices
of
the
guides
repeating
his
name
which
was
reverbed
from
cliff
to
cliff
till
a
hundred
tongues
seemed
to
call
him
when
he
soon
quieted
the
fears
of
the
count
and
the
lady
blanche
by
returning
to
the
cave
as
the
storm
however
seemed
approaching
they
did
not
quit
their
place
of
shelter
and
the
count
seated
between
his
daughter
and
st
foix
endeavoured
to
divert
the
fears
of
the
former
and
conversed
on
subjects
relating
to
the
natural
history
of
the
scene
among
which
they
wandered
he
spoke
of
the
mineral
and
fossile
substances
found
in
the
depths
of
these
mountainsâ€”the
veins
of
marble
and
granite
with
which
they
abounded
the
strata
of
shells
discovered
near
their
summits
many
thousand
fathom
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
at
a
vast
distance
from
its
present
shoreâ€”of
the
tremendous
chasms
and
caverns
of
the
rocks
the
grotesque
form
of
the
mountains
and
the
various
phenomena
that
seem
to
stamp
upon
the
world
the
history
of
the
deluge
from
the
natural
history
he
descended
to
the
mention
of
events
and
circumstances
connected
with
the
civil
story
of
the
pyrenees
named
some
of
the
most
remarkable
fortresses
which
france
and
spain
had
erected
in
the
passes
of
these
mountains
and
gave
a
brief
account
of
some
celebrated
sieges
and
encounters
in
early
times
when
ambition
first
frightened
solitude
from
these
her
deep
recesses
made
her
mountains
which
before
had
echoed
only
to
the
torrentâ€™s
roar
tremble
with
the
clang
of
arms
and
when
manâ€™s
first
footsteps
in
her
sacred
haunts
had
left
the
print
of
blood
as
blanche
sat
attentive
to
the
narrative
that
rendered
the
scenes
doubly
interesting
and
resigned
to
solemn
emotion
while
she
considered
that
she
was
on
the
very
ground
once
polluted
by
these
events
her
reverie
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
a
sound
that
came
in
the
windâ€”it
was
the
distant
bark
of
a
watch-dog
the
travellers
listened
with
eager
hope
and
as
the
wind
blew
stronger
fancied
that
the
sound
came
from
no
great
distance
and
the
guides
having
little
doubt
that
it
proceeded
from
the
inn
they
were
in
search
of
the
count
determined
to
pursue
his
way
the
moon
now
afforded
a
stronger
though
still
an
uncertain
light
as
she
moved
among
broken
clouds
and
the
travellers
led
by
the
sound
recommenced
their
journey
along
the
brow
of
the
precipice
preceded
by
a
single
torch
that
now
contended
with
the
moonlight
for
the
guides
believing
they
should
reach
the
inn
soon
after
sunset
had
neglected
to
provide
more
in
silent
caution
they
followed
the
sound
which
was
heard
but
at
intervals
and
which
after
some
time
entirely
ceased
the
guides
endeavoured
however
to
point
their
course
to
the
quarter
whence
it
had
issued
but
the
deep
roaring
of
a
torrent
soon
seized
their
attention
and
presently
they
came
to
a
tremendous
chasm
of
the
mountain
which
seemed
to
forbid
all
further
progress
blanche
alighted
from
her
mule
as
did
the
count
and
st
foix
while
the
guides
traversed
the
edge
in
search
of
a
bridge
which
however
rude
might
convey
them
to
the
opposite
side
and
they
at
length
confessed
what
the
count
had
begun
to
suspect
that
they
had
been
for
some
time
doubtful
of
their
way
and
were
now
certain
only
that
they
had
lost
it
at
a
little
distance
was
discovered
a
rude
and
dangerous
passage
formed
by
an
enormous
pine
which
thrown
across
the
chasm
united
the
opposite
precipices
and
which
had
been
felled
probably
by
the
hunter
to
facilitate
his
chace
of
the
izard
or
the
wolf
the
whole
party
the
guides
excepted
shuddered
at
the
prospect
of
crossing
this
alpine
bridge
whose
sides
afforded
no
kind
of
defence
and
from
which
to
fall
was
to
die
the
guides
however
prepared
to
lead
over
the
mules
while
blanche
stood
trembling
on
the
brink
and
listening
to
the
roar
of
the
waters
which
were
seen
descending
from
rocks
above
overhung
with
lofty
pines
and
thence
precipitating
themselves
into
the
deep
abyss
where
their
white
surges
gleamed
faintly
in
the
moonlight
the
poor
animals
proceeded
over
this
perilous
bridge
with
instinctive
caution
neither
frightened
by
the
noise
of
the
cataract
nor
deceived
by
the
gloom
which
the
impending
foliage
threw
athwart
their
way
it
was
now
that
the
solitary
torch
which
had
been
hitherto
of
little
service
was
found
to
be
an
inestimable
treasure
and
blanche
terrified
shrinking
but
endeavouring
to
recollect
all
her
firmness
and
presence
of
mind
preceded
by
her
lover
and
supported
by
her
father
followed
the
red
gleam
of
the
torch
in
safety
to
the
opposite
cliff
as
they
went
on
the
heights
contracted
and
formed
a
narrow
pass
at
the
bottom
of
which
the
torrent
they
had
just
crossed
was
heard
to
thunder
but
they
were
again
cheered
by
the
bark
of
a
dog
keeping
watch
perhaps
over
the
flocks
of
the
mountains
to
protect
them
from
the
nightly
descent
of
the
wolves
the
sound
was
much
nearer
than
before
and
while
they
rejoiced
in
the
hope
of
soon
reaching
a
place
of
repose
a
light
was
seen
to
glimmer
at
a
distance
it
appeared
at
a
height
considerably
above
the
level
of
their
path
and
was
lost
and
seen
again
as
if
the
waving
branches
of
trees
sometimes
excluded
and
then
admitted
its
rays
the
guides
hallooed
with
all
their
strength
but
the
sound
of
no
human
voice
was
heard
in
return
and
at
length
as
a
more
effectual
means
of
making
themselves
known
they
fired
a
pistol
but
while
they
listened
in
anxious
expectation
the
noise
of
the
explosion
was
alone
heard
echoing
among
the
rocks
and
it
gradually
sunk
into
silence
which
no
friendly
hint
of
man
disturbed
the
light
however
that
had
been
seen
before
now
became
plainer
and
soon
after
voices
were
heard
indistinctly
on
the
wind
but
upon
the
guides
repeating
the
call
the
voices
suddenly
ceased
and
the
light
disappeared
the
lady
blanche
was
now
almost
sinking
beneath
the
pressure
of
anxiety
fatigue
and
apprehension
and
the
united
efforts
of
the
count
and
st
foix
could
scarcely
support
her
spirits
as
they
continued
to
advance
an
object
was
perceived
on
a
point
of
rock
above
which
the
strong
rays
of
the
moon
then
falling
on
it
appeared
to
be
a
watch-tower
the
count
from
its
situation
and
some
other
circumstances
had
little
doubt
that
it
was
such
and
believing
that
the
light
had
proceeded
from
thence
he
endeavoured
to
reanimate
his
daughterâ€™s
spirits
by
the
near
prospect
of
shelter
and
repose
which
however
rude
the
accommodation
a
ruined
watch-tower
might
afford
â€œnumerous
watch-towers
have
been
erected
among
the
pyreneesâ€
said
the
count
anxious
only
to
call
blancheâ€™s
attention
from
the
subject
of
her
fears
â€œand
the
method
by
which
they
give
intelligence
of
the
approach
of
the
enemy
is
you
know
by
fires
kindled
on
the
summits
of
these
edifices
signals
have
thus
sometimes
been
communicated
from
post
to
post
along
a
frontier
line
of
several
hundred
miles
in
length
then
as
occasion
may
require
the
lurking
armies
emerge
from
their
fortresses
and
the
forests
and
march
forth
to
defend
perhaps
the
entrance
of
some
grand
pass
where
planting
themselves
on
the
heights
they
assail
their
astonished
enemies
who
wind
along
the
glen
below
with
fragments
of
the
shattered
cliff
and
pour
death
and
defeat
upon
them
the
ancient
forts
and
watch-towers
overlooking
the
grand
passes
of
the
pyrenees
are
carefully
preserved
but
some
of
those
in
inferior
stations
have
been
suffered
to
fall
into
decay
and
are
now
frequently
converted
into
the
more
peaceful
habitation
of
the
hunter
or
the
shepherd
who
after
a
day
of
toil
retires
hither
and
with
his
faithful
dogs
forgets
near
a
cheerful
blaze
the
labour
of
the
chace
or
the
anxiety
of
collecting
his
wandering
flocks
while
he
is
sheltered
from
the
nightly
stormâ€
â€œbut
are
they
always
thus
peacefully
inhabitedâ€
said
the
lady
blanche
â€œnoâ€
replied
the
count
â€œthey
are
sometimes
the
asylum
of
french
and
spanish
smugglers
who
cross
the
mountains
with
contraband
goods
from
their
respective
countries
and
the
latter
are
particularly
numerous
against
whom
strong
parties
of
the
kingâ€™s
troops
are
sometimes
sent
but
the
desperate
resolution
of
these
adventurers
who
knowing
that
if
they
are
taken
they
must
expiate
the
breach
of
the
law
by
the
most
cruel
death
travel
in
large
parties
well
armed
often
daunts
the
courage
of
the
soldiers
the
smugglers
who
seek
only
safety
never
engage
when
they
can
possibly
avoid
it
the
military
also
who
know
that
in
these
encounters
danger
is
certain
and
glory
almost
unattainable
are
equally
reluctant
to
fight
an
engagement
therefore
very
seldom
happens
but
when
it
does
it
never
concludes
till
after
the
most
desperate
and
bloody
conflict
you
are
inattentive
blancheâ€
added
the
count
â€œi
have
wearied
you
with
a
dull
subject
but
see
yonder
in
the
moonlight
is
the
edifice
we
have
been
in
search
of
and
we
are
fortunate
to
be
so
near
it
before
the
storm
burstsâ€
blanche
looking
up
perceived
that
they
were
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
on
whose
summit
the
building
stood
but
no
light
now
issued
from
it
the
barking
of
the
dog
too
had
for
some
time
ceased
and
the
guides
began
to
doubt
whether
this
was
really
the
object
of
their
search
from
the
distance
at
which
they
surveyed
it
shown
imperfectly
by
a
cloudy
moon
it
appeared
to
be
of
more
extent
than
a
single
watch-tower
but
the
difficulty
was
how
to
ascend
the
height
whose
abrupt
declivities
seemed
to
afford
no
kind
of
pathway
while
the
guides
carried
forward
the
torch
to
examine
the
cliff
the
count
remaining
with
blanche
and
st
foix
at
its
foot
under
the
shadow
of
the
woods
endeavoured
again
to
beguile
the
time
by
conversation
but
again
anxiety
abstracted
the
mind
of
blanche
and
he
then
consulted
apart
with
st
foix
whether
it
would
be
advisable
should
a
path
be
found
to
venture
to
an
edifice
which
might
possibly
harbour
banditti
they
considered
that
their
own
party
was
not
small
and
that
several
of
them
were
well
armed
and
after
enumerating
the
dangers
to
be
incurred
by
passing
the
night
in
the
open
wild
exposed
perhaps
to
the
effects
of
a
thunder-storm
there
remained
not
a
doubt
that
they
ought
to
endeavour
to
obtain
admittance
to
the
edifice
above
at
any
hazard
respecting
the
inhabitants
it
might
harbour
but
the
darkness
and
the
dead
silence
that
surrounded
it
appeared
to
contradict
the
probability
of
its
being
inhabited
at
all
a
shout
from
the
guides
aroused
their
attention
after
which
in
a
few
minutes
one
of
the
countâ€™s
servants
returned
with
intelligence
that
a
path
was
found
and
they
immediately
hastened
to
join
the
guides
when
they
all
ascended
a
little
winding
way
cut
in
the
rock
among
thickets
of
dwarf
wood
and
after
much
toil
and
some
danger
reached
the
summit
where
several
ruined
towers
surrounded
by
a
massy
wall
rose
to
their
view
partially
illumined
by
the
moonlight
the
space
around
the
building
was
silent
and
apparently
forsaken
but
the
count
was
cautious
â€œstep
softlyâ€
said
he
in
a
low
voice
â€œwhile
we
reconnoitre
the
edificeâ€
having
proceeded
silently
along
for
some
paces
they
stopped
at
a
gate
whose
portals
were
terrible
even
in
ruins
and
after
a
momentâ€™s
hesitation
passed
on
to
the
court
of
entrance
but
paused
again
at
the
head
of
a
terrace
which
branching
from
it
ran
along
the
brow
of
a
precipice
over
this
rose
the
main
body
of
the
edifice
which
was
now
seen
to
be
not
a
watch-tower
but
one
of
those
ancient
fortresses
that
from
age
and
neglect
had
fallen
to
decay
many
parts
of
it
however
appeared
to
be
still
entire
it
was
built
of
grey
stone
in
the
heavy
saxon-gothic
style
with
enormous
round
towers
buttresses
of
proportionable
strength
and
the
arch
of
the
large
gate
which
seemed
to
open
into
the
hall
of
the
fabric
was
round
as
was
that
of
a
window
above
the
air
of
solemnity
which
must
so
strongly
have
characterised
the
pile
even
in
the
days
of
its
early
strength
was
now
considerably
heightened
by
its
shattered
battlements
and
half-demolished
walls
and
by
the
huge
masses
of
ruin
scattered
in
its
wide
area
now
silent
and
grass
grown
in
this
court
of
entrance
stood
the
gigantic
remains
of
an
oak
that
seemed
to
have
flourished
and
decayed
with
the
building
which
it
still
appeared
frowningly
to
protect
by
the
few
remaining
branches
leafless
and
moss-grown
that
crowned
its
trunk
and
whose
wide
extent
told
how
enormous
the
tree
had
been
in
a
former
age
this
fortress
was
evidently
once
of
great
strength
and
from
its
situation
on
a
point
of
rock
impending
over
a
deep
glen
had
been
of
great
power
to
annoy
as
well
as
to
resist
the
count
therefore
as
he
stood
surveying
it
was
somewhat
surprised
that
it
had
been
suffered
ancient
as
it
was
to
sink
into
ruins
and
its
present
lonely
and
deserted
air
excited
in
his
breast
emotions
of
melancholy
awe
while
he
indulged
for
a
moment
these
emotions
he
thought
he
heard
a
sound
of
remote
voices
steal
upon
the
stillness
from
within
the
building
the
front
of
which
he
again
surveyed
with
scrutinizing
eyes
but
yet
no
light
was
visible
he
now
determined
to
walk
round
the
fort
to
that
remote
part
of
it
whence
he
thought
the
voices
had
arisen
that
he
might
examine
whether
any
light
could
be
discerned
there
before
he
ventured
to
knock
at
the
gate
for
this
purpose
he
entered
upon
the
terrace
where
the
remains
of
cannon
were
yet
apparent
in
the
thick
walls
but
he
had
not
proceeded
many
paces
when
his
steps
were
suddenly
arrested
by
the
loud
barking
of
a
dog
within
and
which
he
fancied
to
be
the
same
whose
voice
had
been
the
means
of
bringing
the
travellers
thither
it
now
appeared
certain
that
the
place
was
inhabited
and
the
count
returned
to
consult
again
with
st
foix
whether
he
should
try
to
obtain
admittance
for
its
wild
aspect
had
somewhat
shaken
his
former
resolution
but
after
a
second
consultation
he
submitted
to
the
considerations
which
before
determined
him
and
which
were
strengthened
by
the
discovery
of
the
dog
that
guarded
the
fort
as
well
as
by
the
stillness
that
pervaded
it
he
therefore
ordered
one
of
his
servants
to
knock
at
the
gate
who
was
advancing
to
obey
him
when
a
light
appeared
through
the
loop-hole
of
one
of
the
towers
and
the
count
called
loudly
but
receiving
no
answer
he
went
up
to
the
gate
himself
and
struck
upon
it
with
an
iron-pointed
pole
which
had
assisted
him
to
climb
the
steep
when
the
echoes
had
ceased
that
this
blow
had
awakened
the
renewed
barkingâ€”and
there
were
now
more
than
one
dogâ€”was
the
only
sound
that
was
heard
the
count
stepped
back
a
few
paces
to
observe
whether
the
light
was
in
the
tower
and
perceiving
that
it
was
gone
he
returned
to
the
portal
and
had
lifted
the
pole
to
strike
again
when
again
he
fancied
he
heard
the
murmur
of
voices
within
and
paused
to
listen
he
was
confirmed
in
the
supposition
but
they
were
too
remote
to
be
heard
otherwise
than
in
a
murmur
and
the
count
now
let
the
pole
fall
heavily
upon
the
gate
when
almost
immediately
a
profound
silence
followed
it
was
apparent
that
the
people
within
had
heard
the
sound
and
their
caution
in
admitting
strangers
gave
him
a
favourable
opinion
of
them
â€œthey
are
either
hunters
or
shepherdsâ€
said
he
â€œwho
like
ourselves
have
probably
sought
shelter
from
the
night
within
these
walls
and
are
fearful
of
admitting
strangers
lest
they
should
prove
robbers
i
will
endeavour
to
remove
their
fearsâ€
so
saying
he
called
aloud
â€œwe
are
friends
who
ask
shelter
from
the
nightâ€
in
a
few
moments
steps
were
heard
within
which
approached
and
a
voice
then
enquiredâ€”â€œwho
callsâ€
â€œfriendsâ€
repeated
the
count
â€œopen
the
gates
and
you
shall
know
moreâ€â€”strong
bolts
were
now
heard
to
be
undrawn
and
a
man
armed
with
a
hunting
spear
appeared
â€œwhat
is
it
you
want
at
this
hourâ€
said
he
the
count
beckoned
his
attendants
and
then
answered
that
he
wished
to
enquire
the
way
to
the
nearest
cabin
â€œare
you
so
little
acquainted
with
these
mountainsâ€
said
the
man
â€œas
not
to
know
that
there
is
none
within
several
leagues
i
cannot
show
you
the
way
you
must
seek
itâ€”thereâ€™s
a
moonâ€
saying
this
he
was
closing
the
gate
and
the
count
was
turning
away
half
disappointed
and
half
afraid
when
another
voice
was
heard
from
above
and
on
looking
up
he
saw
a
light
and
a
manâ€™s
face
at
the
grate
of
the
portal
â€œstay
friend
you
have
lost
your
wayâ€
said
the
voice
â€œyou
are
hunters
i
suppose
like
ourselves
i
will
be
with
you
presentlyâ€
the
voice
ceased
and
the
light
disappeared
blanche
had
been
alarmed
by
the
appearance
of
the
man
who
had
opened
the
gate
and
she
now
entreated
her
father
to
quit
the
place
but
the
count
had
observed
the
hunterâ€™s
spear
which
he
carried
and
the
words
from
the
tower
encouraged
him
to
await
the
event
the
gate
was
soon
opened
and
several
men
in
huntersâ€™
habits
who
had
heard
above
what
had
passed
below
appeared
and
having
listened
some
time
to
the
count
told
him
he
was
welcome
to
rest
there
for
the
night
they
then
pressed
him
with
much
courtesy
to
enter
and
to
partake
of
such
fare
as
they
were
about
to
sit
down
to
the
count
who
had
observed
them
attentively
while
they
spoke
was
cautious
and
somewhat
suspicious
but
he
was
also
weary
fearful
of
the
approaching
storm
and
of
encountering
alpine
heights
in
the
obscurity
of
night
being
likewise
somewhat
confident
in
the
strength
and
number
of
his
attendants
he
after
some
further
consideration
determined
to
accept
the
invitation
with
this
resolution
he
called
his
servants
who
advancing
round
the
tower
behind
which
some
of
them
had
silently
listened
to
this
conference
followed
their
lord
the
lady
blanche
and
st
foix
into
the
fortress
the
strangers
led
them
on
to
a
large
and
rude
hall
partially
seen
by
a
fire
that
blazed
at
its
extremity
round
which
four
men
in
the
hunterâ€™s
dress
were
seated
and
on
the
hearth
were
several
dogs
stretched
in
sleep
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
stood
a
large
table
and
over
the
fire
some
part
of
an
animal
was
boiling
as
the
count
approached
the
men
arose
and
the
dogs
half
raising
themselves
looked
fiercely
at
the
strangers
but
on
hearing
their
mastersâ€™
voices
kept
their
postures
on
the
hearth
blanche
looked
round
this
gloomy
and
spacious
hall
then
at
the
men
and
to
her
father
who
smiling
cheerfully
at
her
addressed
himself
to
the
hunters
â€œthis
is
a
hospitable
hearthâ€
said
he
â€œthe
blaze
of
a
fire
is
reviving
after
having
wandered
so
long
in
these
dreary
wilds
your
dogs
are
tired
what
success
have
you
hadâ€
â€œsuch
as
we
usually
haveâ€
replied
one
of
the
men
who
had
been
seated
in
the
hall
â€œwe
kill
our
game
with
tolerable
certaintyâ€
â€œthese
are
fellow
huntersâ€
said
one
of
the
men
who
had
brought
the
count
hither
â€œthat
have
lost
their
way
and
i
have
told
them
there
is
room
enough
in
the
fort
for
us
allâ€
â€œvery
true
very
trueâ€
replied
his
companion
â€œwhat
luck
have
you
had
in
the
chace
brothers
we
have
killed
two
izards
and
that
you
will
say
is
pretty
wellâ€
â€œyou
mistake
friendâ€
said
the
count
â€œwe
are
not
hunters
but
travellers
but
if
you
will
admit
us
to
huntersâ€™
fare
we
shall
be
well
contented
and
will
repay
your
kindnessâ€
â€œsit
down
then

said
one
of
the
men
â€œjacques

and
as
bright

blanche
timidly
smiled
and
was
going
to
refuse
when
her
father
prevented
her
by
taking
with
a
good
humoured
air
the
glass
offered
to
his
daughter
and
mons
st
foix
who
was
seated
next
her
pressed
her
hand
and
gave
her
an
encouraging
look
but
her
attention
was
engaged
by
a
man
who
sat
silently
by
the
fire
observing
st
foix
with
a
steady
and
earnest
eye
â€œyou
lead
a
jolly
life
hereâ€
said
the
count
â€œthe
life
of
a
hunter
is
a
pleasant
and
a
healthy
one
and
the
repose
is
sweet
which
succeeds
to
your
labourâ€
â€œyesâ€
replied
one
of
his
hosts
â€œour
life
is
pleasant
enough
we
live
here
only
during
the
summer
and
autumnal
months
in
winter
the
place
is
dreary
and
the
swoln
torrents
that
descend
from
the
heights
put
a
stop
to
the
chaceâ€
â€œâ€™tis
a
life
of
liberty
and
enjoymentâ€
said
the
count
â€œi
should
like
to
pass
a
month
in
your
way
very
wellâ€
â€œwe
find
employment
for
our
guns
tooâ€
said
a
man
who
stood
behind
the
count
â€œhere
are
plenty
of
birds
of
delicious
flavour
that
feed
upon
the
wild
thyme
and
herbs
that
grow
in

i
think
of

is
a
brace
of
birds
hung
up
in
the
stone
gallery
go
fetch
them
jacques
we
will
have
them
dressedâ€
the
count
now
made
enquiry
concerning
the
method
of
pursuing
the
chace
among
the
rocks
and
precipices
of
these
romantic
regions
and
was
listening
to
a
curious
detail
when
a
horn
was
sounded
at
the
gate
blanche
looked
timidly
at
her
father
who
continued
to
converse
on
the
subject
of
the
chace
but
whose
countenance
was
somewhat
expressive
of
anxiety
and
who
often
turned
his
eyes
towards
that
part
of
the
hall
nearest
the
gate
the
horn
sounded
again
and
a
loud
halloo
succeeded
â€œthese
are
some
of
our
companions
returned
from
their
dayâ€™s
labourâ€
said
a
man
going
lazily
from
his
seat
towards
the
gate
and
in
a
few
minutes
two
men
appeared
each
with
a
gun
over
his
shoulder
and
pistols
in
his
belt
â€œwhat
cheer
my
lads
what
cheerâ€
said
they
as
they
approached
â€œwhat
luckâ€
returned
their
companions
â€œhave
you
brought
home
your
supper
you
shall
have
none
elseâ€
â€œhah
who
the
devil
have
you
brought
homeâ€
said
they
in
bad
spanish
on
perceiving
the
countâ€™s
party
â€œare
they
from
france
or
spainâ€”where
did
you
meet
with
themâ€
â€œthey
met
with
us
and
a
merry
meeting
tooâ€
replied
his
companion
aloud
in
good
french
â€œthis
chevalier
and
his
party
had
lost
their
way
and
asked
a
nightâ€™s
lodging
in
the
fortâ€
the
others
made
no
reply
but
threw
down
a
kind
of
knapsack
and
drew
forth
several
brace
of
birds
the
bag
sounded
heavily
as
it
fell
to
the
ground
and
the
glitter
of
some
bright
metal
within
glanced
on
the
eye
of
the
count
who
now
surveyed
with
a
more
enquiring
look
the
man
that
held
the
knapsack
he
was
a
tall
robust
figure
of
a
hard
countenance
and
had
short
black
hair
curling
in
his
neck
instead
of
the
hunterâ€™s
dress
he
wore
a
faded
military
uniform
sandals
were
laced
on
his
broad
legs
and
a
kind
of
short
trowsers
hung
from
his
waist
on
his
head
he
wore
a
leathern
cap
somewhat
resembling
in
shape
an
ancient
roman
helmet
but
the
brows
that
scowled
beneath
it
would
have
characterised
those
of
the
barbarians
who
conquered
rome
rather
than
those
of
a
roman
soldier
the
count
at
length
turned
away
his
eyes
and
remained
silent
and
thoughtful
till
again
raising
them
he
perceived
a
figure
standing
in
an
obscure
part
of
the
hall
fixed
in
attentive
gaze
on
st
foix
who
was
conversing
with
blanche
and
did
not
observe
this
but
the
count
soon
after
saw
the
same
man
looking
over
the
shoulder
of
the
soldier
as
attentively
at
himself
he
withdrew
his
eye
when
that
of
the
count
met
it
who
felt
mistrust
gathering
fast
upon
his
mind
but
feared
to
betray
it
in
his
countenance
and
forcing
his
features
to
assume
a
smile
addressed
blanche
on
some
indifferent
subject
when
he
again
looked
round
he
perceived
that
the
soldier
and
his
companion
were
gone
the
man
who
was
called
jacques
now
returned
from
the
stone
gallery
â€œa
fire
is
lighted
thereâ€
said
he
â€œand
the
birds
are
dressing
the
table
too
is
spread
there
for
that
place
is
warmer
than
thisâ€
his
companions
approved
of
the
removal
and
invited
their
guests
to
follow
to
the
gallery
of
whom
blanche
appeared
distressed
and
remained
seated
and
st
foix
looked
at
the
count
who
said
he
preferred
the
comfortable
blaze
of
the
fire
he
was
then
near
the
hunters
however
commended
the
warmth
of
the
other
apartment
and
pressed
his
removal
with
such
seeming
courtesy
that
the
count
half
doubting
and
half
fearful
of
betraying
his
doubts
consented
to
go
the
long
and
ruinous
passages
through
which
they
went
somewhat
daunted
him
but
the
thunder
which
now
burst
in
loud
peals
above
made
it
dangerous
to
quit
this
place
of
shelter
and
he
forbore
to
provoke
his
conductors
by
showing
that
he
distrusted
them
the
hunters
led
the
way
with
a
lamp
the
count
and
st
foix
who
wished
to
please
their
hosts
by
some
instances
of
familiarity
carried
each
a
seat
and
blanche
followed
with
faltering
steps
as
she
passed
on
part
of
her
dress
caught
on
a
nail
in
the
wall
and
while
she
stopped
somewhat
too
scrupulously
to
disengage
it
the
count
who
was
talking
to
st
foix
and
neither
of
whom
observed
the
circumstance
followed
their
conductor
round
an
abrupt
angle
of
the
passage
and
blanche
was
left
behind
in
darkness
the
thunder
prevented
them
from
hearing
her
call
but
having
disengaged
her
dress
she
quickly
followed
as
she
thought
the
way
they
had
taken
a
light
that
glimmered
at
a
distance
confirmed
this
belief
and
she
proceeded
towards
an
open
door
whence
it
issued
conjecturing
the
room
beyond
to
be
the
stone
gallery
the
men
had
spoken
of
hearing
voices
as
she
advanced
she
paused
within
a
few
paces
of
the
chamber
that
she
might
be
certain
whether
she
was
right
and
from
thence
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
observed
four
men
seated
round
a
table
over
which
they
leaned
in
apparent
consultation
in
one
of
them
she
distinguished
the
features
of
him
whom
she
had
observed
gazing
at
st
foix
with
such
deep
attention
and
who
was
now
speaking
in
an
earnest
though
restrained
voice
till
one
of
his
companions
seeming
to
oppose
him
they
spoke
together
in
a
loud
and
harsher
tone
blanche
alarmed
by
perceiving
that
neither
her
father
nor
st
foix
were
there
and
terrified
at
the
fierce
countenances
and
manners
of
these
men
was
turning
hastily
from
the
chamber
to
pursue
her
search
of
the
gallery
when
she
heard
one
of
the
men
say
â€œlet
all
dispute
end
here
who
talks
of
danger
follow
my
advice
and
there
will
be
noneâ€”secure
them
and
the
rest
are
an
easy
preyâ€
blanche
struck
with
these
words
paused
a
moment
to
hear
more
â€œthere
is
nothing
to
be
got
by
the
restâ€
said
one
of
his
companions
â€œi
am
never
for
blood
when
i
can
help
itâ€”dispatch
the
two
others
and
our
business
is
done
the
rest
may
goâ€
â€œmay
they
soâ€
exclaimed
the
first
ruffian
with
a
tremendous
oathâ€”â€œwhat
to
tell
how
we
have
disposed
of
their
masters
and
to
send
the
kingâ€™s
troops
to
drag
us
to
the
wheel
you
were
always
a
choice
adviserâ€”i
warrant
we
have
not
yet
forgot
st
thomasâ€™s
eve
last
yearâ€
blancheâ€™s
heart
now
sunk
with
horror
her
first
impulse
was
to
retreat
from
the
door
but
when
she
would
have
gone
her
trembling
frame
refused
to
support
her
and
having
tottered
a
few
paces
to
a
more
obscure
part
of
the
passage
she
was
compelled
to
listen
to
the
dreadful
councils
of
those
who
she
was
no
longer
suffered
to
doubt
were
banditti
in
the
next
moment
she
heard
the
following
words
â€œwhy
you
would
not
murder
the
whole
gangâ€
â€œi
warrant
our
lives
are
as
good
as
theirsâ€
replied
his
comrade
â€œif
we
donâ€™t
kill
them
they
will
hang
us
better
they
should
die
than
we
be
hangedâ€
â€œbetter
betterâ€
cried
his
comrades
â€œto
commit
murder
is
a
hopeful
way
of
escaping
the
gallowsâ€
said
the
first
ruffianâ€”â€œmany
an
honest
fellow
has
run
his
head
into
the
noose
that
way
thoughâ€
there
was
a
pause
of
some
moments
during
which
they
appeared
to
be
considering
â€œconfound
those
fellowsâ€
exclaimed
one
of
the
robbers
impatiently
â€œthey
ought
to
have
been
here
by
this
time
they
will
come
back
presently
with
the
old
story
and
no
booty
if
they
were
here
our
business
would
be
plain
and
easy
i
see
we
shall
not
be
able
to
do
the
business
tonight
for
our
numbers
are
not
equal
to
the
enemy
and
in
the
morning
they
will
be
for
marching
off
and
how
can
we
detain
them
without
forceâ€
â€œi
have
been
thinking
of
a
scheme
that
will
doâ€
said
one
of
his
comrades
â€œif
we
can
dispatch
the
two
chevaliers
silently
it
will
be
easy
to
master
the
restâ€
â€œthatâ€™s
a
plausible
scheme
in
good
faithâ€
said
another
with
a
smile
of
scornâ€”â€œif
i
can
eat
my
way
through
the
prison
wall
i
shall
be
at
libertyâ€”how
can
we
dispatch
them
silentlyâ€
â€œby
poisonâ€
replied
his
companions
â€œwell
said
that
will
doâ€
said
the
second
ruffian
â€œthat
will
give
a
lingering
death
too
and
satisfy
my
revenge
these
barons
shall
take
care
how
they
again
tempt
our
vengeanceâ€
â€œi
knew
the
son
the
moment
i
saw
himâ€
said
the
man
whom
blanche
had
observed
gazing
on
st
foix
â€œthough
he
does
not
know
me
the
father
i
had
almost
forgottenâ€
â€œwell
you
may
say
what
you
willâ€
said
the
third
ruffian
â€œbut
i
donâ€™t
believe
he
is
the
baron
and
i
am
as
likely
to
know
as
any
of
you
for
i
was
one
of
them
that
attacked
him
with
our
brave
lads
that
sufferedâ€
â€œand
was
not
i
anotherâ€
said
the
first
ruffian
â€œi
tell
you
he
is
the
baron
but
what
does
it
signify
whether
he
is
or
notâ€”shall
we
let
all
this
booty
go
out
of
our
hands
it
is
not
often
we
have
such
luck
at
this
while
we
run
the
chance
of
the
wheel
for
smuggling
a
few
pounds
of
tobacco
to
cheat
the
kingâ€™s
manufactory
and
of
breaking
our
necks
down
the
precipices
in
the
chace
of
our
food
and
now
and
then
rob
a
brother
smuggler
or
a
straggling
pilgrim
of
what
scarcely
repays
us
the
powder
we
fire
at
them
shall
we
let
such
a
prize
as
this
go
why
they
have
enough
about
them
to
keep
us
forâ€”â€
â€œi
am
not
for
that
i
am
not
for
thatâ€
replied
the
third
robber
â€œlet
us
make
the
most
of
them
only
if
this
is
the
baron
i
should
like
to
have
a
flash
the
more
at
him
for
the
sake
of
our
brave
comrades
that
he
brought
to
the
gallowsâ€
â€œaye
aye
flash
as
much
as
you
willâ€
rejoined
the
first
man
â€œbut
i
tell
you
the
baron
is
a
taller
manâ€
â€œconfound
your
quibblingâ€
said
the
second
ruffian
â€œshall
we
let
them
go
or
not
if
we
stay
here
much
longer
they
will
take
the
hint
and
march
off
without
our
leave
let
them
be
who
they
will
they
are
rich
or
why
all
those
servants
did
you
see
the
ring
he
you
call
the
baron
had
on
his
fingerâ€”it
was
a
diamond
but
he
has
not
got
it
on
now
he
saw
me
looking
at
it
i
warrant
and
took
it
offâ€
â€œaye
and
then
there
is
the
picture
did
you
see
that
she
has
not
taken
that
offâ€
observed
the
first
ruffian
â€œit
hangs
at
her
neck
if
it
had
not
sparkled
so
i
should
not
have
found
it
out
for
it
was
almost
hid
by
her
dress
those
are
diamonds
too
and
a
rare
many
of
them
there
must
be
to
go
round
such
a
large
pictureâ€
â€œbut
how
are
we
to
manage
this
businessâ€
said
the
second
ruffian
â€œlet
us
talk
of
that
there
is
no
fear
of
there
being
booty
enough
but
how
are
we
to
secure
itâ€
â€œaye
ayeâ€
said
his
comrades
â€œlet
us
talk
of
that
and
remember
no
time
is
to
be
lostâ€
â€œi
am
still
for
poisonâ€
observed
the
third
â€œbut
consider
their
number
why
there
are
nine
or
ten
of
them
and
armed
too
when
i
saw
so
many
at
the
gate
i
was
not
for
letting
them
in
you
know
nor
you
eitherâ€
â€œi
thought
they
might
be
some
of
our
enemiesâ€
replied
the
second
â€œi
did
not
so
much
mind
numbersâ€
â€œbut
you
must
mind
them
nowâ€
rejoined
his
comrade
â€œor
it
will
be
worse
for
you
we
are
not
more
than
six
and
how
can
we
master
ten
by
open
force
i
tell
you
we
must
give
some
of
them
a
dose
and
the
rest
may
then
be
managedâ€
â€œiâ€™ll
tell
you
a
better
wayâ€
rejoined
the
other
impatiently
â€œdraw
closerâ€
blanche
who
had
listened
to
this
conversation
in
an
agony
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
could
no
longer
distinguish
what
was
said
for
the
ruffians
now
spoke
in
lowered
voices
but
the
hope
that
she
might
save
her
friends
from
the
plot
if
she
could
find
her
way
quickly
to
them
suddenly
reanimated
her
spirits
and
lent
her
strength
enough
to
turn
her
steps
in
search
of
the
gallery
terror
however
and
darkness
conspired
against
her
and
having
moved
a
few
yards
the
feeble
light
that
issued
from
the
chamber
no
longer
even
contended
with
the
gloom
and
her
foot
stumbling
over
a
step
that
crossed
the
passage
she
fell
to
the
ground
the
noise
startled
the
banditti
who
became
suddenly
silent
and
then
all
rushed
to
the
passage
to
examine
whether
any
person
was
there
who
might
have
overheard
their
councils
blanche
saw
them
approaching
and
perceived
their
fierce
and
eager
looks
but
before
she
could
raise
herself
they
discovered
and
seized
her
and
as
they
dragged
her
towards
the
chamber
they
had
quitted
her
screams
drew
from
them
horrible
threatenings
having
reached
the
room
they
began
to
consult
what
they
should
do
with
her
â€œlet
us
first
know
what
she
had
heardâ€
said
the
chief
robber
â€œhow
long
have
you
been
in
the
passage
lady
and
what
brought
you
thereâ€
â€œlet
us
first
secure
that
pictureâ€
said
one
of
his
comrades
approaching
the
trembling
blanche
â€œfair
lady
by
your
leave
that
picture
is
mine
come
surrender
it
or
i
shall
seize
itâ€
blanche
entreating
their
mercy
immediately
gave
up
the
miniature
while
another
of
the
ruffians
fiercely
interrogated
her
concerning
what
she
had
overheard
of
their
conversation
when
her
confusion
and
terror
too
plainly
telling
what
her
tongue
feared
to
confess
the
ruffians
looked
expressively
upon
one
another
and
two
of
them
withdrew
to
a
remote
part
of
the
room
as
if
to
consult
further
â€œthese
are
diamonds
by
st
peterâ€
exclaimed
the
fellow
who
had
been
examining
the
miniature
â€œand
here
is
a
very
pretty
picture
too
â€œfaith
as
handsome
a
young
chevalier
as
you
would
wish
to
see
by
a
summerâ€™s
sun
lady
this
is
your
spouse
i
warrant
for
it
is
the
spark
that
was
in
your
company
just
nowâ€
blanche
sinking
with
terror
conjured
him
to
have
pity
on
her
and
delivering
him
her
purse
promised
to
say
nothing
of
what
had
passed
if
he
would
suffer
her
to
return
to
her
friends
he
smiled
ironically
and
was
going
to
reply
when
his
attention
was
called
off
by
a
distant
noise
and
while
he
listened
he
grasped
the
arm
of
blanche
more
firmly
as
if
he
feared
she
would
escape
from
him
and
she
again
shrieked
for
help
the
approaching
sounds
called
the
ruffians
from
the
other
part
of
the
chamber
â€œwe
are
betrayedâ€
said
they
â€œbut
let
us
listen
a
moment
perhaps
it
is
only
our
comrades
come
in
from
the
mountains
and
if
so
our
work
is
sure
listenâ€
a
distant
discharge
of
shot
confirmed
this
supposition
for
a
moment
but
in
the
next
the
former
sounds
drawing
nearer
the
clashing
of
swords
mingled
with
the
voices
of
loud
contention
and
with
heavy
groans
were
distinguished
in
the
avenue
leading
to
the
chamber
while
the
ruffians
prepared
their
arms
they
heard
themselves
called
by
some
of
their
comrades
afar
off
and
then
a
shrill
horn
was
sounded
without
the
fortress
a
signal
it
appeared
they
too
well
understood
for
three
of
them
leaving
the
lady
blanche
to
the
care
of
the
fourth
instantly
rushed
from
the
chamber
while
blanche
trembling
and
nearly
fainting
was
supplicating
for
release
she
heard
amid
the
tumult
that
approached
the
voice
of
st
foix
and
she
had
scarcely
renewed
her
shriek
when
the
door
of
the
room
was
thrown
open
and
he
appeared
much
disfigured
with
blood
and
pursued
by
several
ruffians
blanche
neither
saw
nor
heard
any
more
her
head
swam
her
sight
failed
and
she
became
senseless
in
the
arms
of
the
robber
who
had
detained
her
when
she
recovered
she
perceived
by
the
gloomy
light
that
trembled
round
her
that
she
was
in
the
same
chamber
but
neither
the
count
st
foix
nor
any
other
person
appeared
and
she
continued
for
some
time
entirely
still
and
nearly
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
but
the
dreadful
images
of
the
past
returning
she
endeavoured
to
raise
herself
that
she
might
seek
her
friends
when
a
sullen
groan
at
a
little
distance
reminded
her
of
st
foix
and
of
the
condition
in
which
she
had
seen
him
enter
this
room
then
starting
from
the
floor
by
a
sudden
effort
of
horror
she
advanced
to
the
place
whence
the
sound
had
proceeded
where
a
body
was
lying
stretched
upon
the
pavement
and
where
by
the
glimmering
light
of
a
lamp
she
discovered
the
pale
and
disfigured
countenance
of
st
foix
her
horrors
at
that
moment
may
be
easily
imagined
he
was
speechless
his
eyes
were
half
closed
and
on
the
hand
which
she
grasped
in
the
agony
of
despair
cold
damps
had
settled
while
she
vainly
repeated
his
name
and
called
for
assistance
steps
approached
and
a
person
entered
the
chamber
who
she
soon
perceived
was
not
the
count
her
father
but
what
was
her
astonishment
when
supplicating
him
to
give
his
assistance
to
st
foix
she
discovered
ludovico
he
scarcely
paused
to
recognise
her
but
immediately
bound
up
the
wounds
of
the
chevalier
and
perceiving
that
he
had
fainted
probably
from
loss
of
blood
ran
for
water
but
he
had
been
absent
only
a
few
moments
when
blanche
heard
other
steps
approaching
and
while
she
was
almost
frantic
with
apprehension
of
the
ruffians
the
light
of
a
torch
flashed
upon
the
walls
and
then
count
de
villefort
appeared
with
an
affrighted
countenance
and
breathless
with
impatience
calling
upon
his
daughter
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
rose
and
ran
to
his
arms
while
he
letting
fall
the
bloody
sword
he
held
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
in
a
transport
of
gratitude
and
joy
and
then
hastily
enquired
for
st
foix
who
now
gave
some
signs
of
life
ludovico
soon
after
returning
with
water
and
brandy
the
former
was
applied
to
his
lips
and
the
latter
to
his
temples
and
hands
and
blanche
at
length
saw
him
unclose
his
eyes
and
then
heard
him
enquire
for
her
but
the
joy
she
felt
on
this
occasion
was
interrupted
by
new
alarms
when
ludovico
said
it
would
be
necessary
to
remove
mons
st
foix
immediately
and
added
â€œthe
banditti
that
are
out
my
lord
were
expected
home
an
hour
ago
and
they
will
certainly
find
us
if
we
delay
that
shrill
horn
they
know
is
never
sounded
by
their
comrades
but
on
most
desperate
occasions
and
it
echoes
among
the
mountains
for
many
leagues
round
i
have
known
them
brought
home
by
its
sound
even
from
the
pied
de
melicant
is
anybody
standing
watch
at
the
great
gate
my
lordâ€
â€œnobodyâ€
replied
the
count
â€œthe
rest
of
my
people
are
now
scattered
about
i
scarcely
know
where
go
ludovico
collect
them
together
and
look
out
yourself
and
listen
if
you
hear
the
feet
of
mulesâ€
ludovico
then
hurried
away
and
the
count
consulted
as
to
the
means
of
removing
st
foix
who
could
not
have
borne
the
motion
of
a
mule
even
if
his
strength
would
have
supported
him
in
the
saddle
while
the
count
was
telling
that
the
banditti
whom
they
had
found
in
the
fort
were
secured
in
the
dungeon
blanche
observed
that
he
was
himself
wounded
and
that
his
left
arm
was
entirely
useless
but
he
smiled
at
her
anxiety
assuring
her
the
wound
was
trifling
the
countâ€™s
servants
except
two
who
kept
watch
at
the
gate
now
appeared
and
soon
after
ludovico
â€œi
think
i
hear
mules
coming
along
the
glen
my
lordâ€
said
he
â€œbut
the
roaring
of
the
torrent
below
will
not
let
me
be
certain
however
i
have
brought
what
will
serve
the
chevalierâ€
he
added
showing
a
bearâ€™s
skin
fastened
to
a
couple
of
long
poles
which
had
been
adapted
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
home
such
of
the
banditti
as
happened
to
be
wounded
in
their
encounters
ludovico
spread
it
on
the
ground
and
placing
the
skins
of
several
goats
upon
it
made
a
kind
of
bed
into
which
the
chevalier
who
was
however
now
much
revived
was
gently
lifted
and
the
poles
being
raised
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
guides
whose
footing
among
these
steeps
could
best
be
depended
upon
he
was
borne
along
with
an
easy
motion
some
of
the
countâ€™s
servants
were
also
woundedâ€”but
not
materially
and
their
wounds
being
bound
up
they
now
followed
to
the
great
gate
as
they
passed
along
the
hall
a
loud
tumult
was
heard
at
some
distance
and
blanche
was
terrified
â€œit
is
only
those
villains
in
the
dungeon
my
ladyâ€
said
ludovico
â€œthey
seem
to
be
bursting
it
openâ€
said
the
count
â€œno
my
lordâ€
replied
ludovico
â€œit
has
an
iron
door
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
them
but
let
me
go
first
and
look
out
from
the
rampartâ€
they
quickly
followed
him
and
found
their
mules
browsing
before
the
gates
where
the
party
listened
anxiously
but
heard
no
sound
except
that
of
the
torrent
below
and
of
the
early
breeze
sighing
among
the
branches
of
the
old
oak
that
grew
in
the
court
and
they
were
now
glad
to
perceive
the
first
tints
of
dawn
over
the
mountain-tops
when
they
had
mounted
their
mules
ludovico
undertaking
to
be
their
guide
led
them
by
an
easier
path
than
that
by
which
they
had
formerly
ascended
into
the
glen
â€œwe
must
avoid
that
valley
to
the
east
my
lordâ€
said
he
â€œor
we
may
meet
the
banditti
they
went
out
that
way
in
the
morningâ€
the
travellers
soon
after
quitted
this
glen
and
found
themselves
in
a
narrow
valley
that
stretched
towards
the
north-west
the
morning
light
upon
the
mountains
now
strengthened
fast
and
gradually
discovered
the
green
hillocks
that
skirted
the
winding
feet
of
the
cliffs
tufted
with
cork
tree
and
ever-green
oak
the
thunder-clouds
being
dispersed
had
left
the
sky
perfectly
serene
and
blanche
was
revived
by
the
fresh
breeze
and
by
the
view
of
verdure
which
the
late
rain
had
brightened
soon
after
the
sun
arose
when
the
dripping
rocks
with
the
shrubs
that
fringed
their
summits
and
many
a
turfy
slope
below
sparkled
in
his
rays
a
wreath
of
mist
was
seen
floating
along
the
extremity
of
the
valley
but
the
gale
bore
it
before
the
travellers
and
the
sunbeams
gradually
drew
it
up
towards
the
summit
of
the
mountains
they
had
proceeded
about
a
league
when
st
foix
having
complained
of
extreme
faintness
they
stopped
to
give
him
refreshment
and
that
the
men
who
bore
him
might
rest
ludovico
had
brought
from
the
fort
some
flasks
of
rich
spanish
wine
which
now
proved
a
reviving
cordial
not
only
to
st
foix
but
to
the
whole
party
though
to
him
it
gave
only
temporary
relief
for
it
fed
the
fever
that
burned
in
his
veins
and
he
could
neither
disguise
in
his
countenance
the
anguish
he
suffered
nor
suppress
the
wish
that
he
was
arrived
at
the
inn
where
they
had
designed
to
pass
the
preceding
night
while
they
thus
reposed
themselves
under
the
shade
of
the
dark
green
pines
the
count
desired
ludovico
to
explain
shortly
by
what
means
he
had
disappeared
from
the
north
apartment
how
he
came
into
the
hands
of
the
banditti
and
how
he
had
contributed
so
essentially
to
serve
him
and
his
family
for
to
him
he
justly
attributed
their
present
deliverance
ludovico
was
going
to
obey
him
when
suddenly
they
heard
the
echo
of
a
pistol-shot
from
the
way
they
had
passed
and
they
rose
in
alarm
hastily
to
pursue
their
route
ah
why
did
fate
his
steps
decoy
in
stormy
paths
to
roam
remote
from
all
congenial
joy
beattie
emily
meanwhile
was
still
suffering
anxiety
as
to
the
fate
of
valancourt
but
theresa
having
at
length
found
a
person
whom
she
could
entrust
on
her
errand
to
the
steward
informed
her
that
the
messenger
would
return
on
the
following
day
and
emily
promised
to
be
at
the
cottage
theresa
being
too
lame
to
attend
her
in
the
evening
therefore
emily
set
out
alone
for
the
cottage
with
a
melancholy
foreboding
concerning
valancourt
while
perhaps
the
gloom
of
the
hour
might
contribute
to
depress
her
spirits
it
was
a
grey
autumnal
evening
towards
the
close
of
the
season
heavy
mists
partially
obscured
the
mountains
and
a
chilling
breeze
that
sighed
among
the
beech
woods
strewed
her
path
with
some
of
their
last
yellow
leaves
these
circling
in
the
blast
and
foretelling
the
death
of
the
year
gave
an
image
of
desolation
to
her
mind
and
in
her
fancy
seemed
to
announce
the
death
of
valancourt
of
this
she
had
indeed
more
than
once
so
strong
a
presentiment
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
returning
home
feeling
herself
unequal
to
an
encounter
with
the
certainty
she
anticipated
but
contending
with
her
emotions
she
so
far
commanded
them
as
to
be
able
to
proceed
while
she
walked
mournfully
on
gazing
on
the
long
volumes
of
vapour
that
poured
upon
the
sky
and
watching
the
swallows
tossed
along
the
wind
now
disappearing
among
tempestuous
clouds
and
then
emerging
for
a
moment
in
circles
upon
the
calmer
air
the
afflictions
and
vicissitudes
of
her
late
life
seemed
portrayed
in
these
fleeting
imagesâ€”thus
had
she
been
tossed
upon
the
stormy
sea
of
misfortune
for
the
last
year
with
but
short
intervals
of
peace
if
peace
that
could
be
called
which
was
only
the
delay
of
evils
and
now
when
she
had
escaped
from
so
many
dangers
was
become
independent
of
the
will
of
those
who
had
oppressed
her
and
found
herself
mistress
of
a
large
fortune
now
when
she
might
reasonably
have
expected
happiness
she
perceived
that
she
was
as
distant
from
it
as
ever
she
would
have
accused
herself
of
weakness
and
ingratitude
in
thus
suffering
a
sense
of
the
various
blessings
she
possessed
to
be
overcome
by
that
of
a
single
misfortune
had
this
misfortune
affected
herself
alone
but
when
she
had
wept
for
valancourt
even
as
living
tears
of
compassion
had
mingled
with
those
of
regret
and
while
she
lamented
a
human
being
degraded
to
vice
and
consequently
to
misery
reason
and
humanity
claimed
these
tears
and
fortitude
had
not
yet
taught
her
to
separate
them
from
those
of
love
in
the
present
moments
however
it
was
not
the
certainty
of
his
guilt
but
the
apprehension
of
his
death
of
a
death
also
to
which
she
herself
however
innocently
appeared
to
have
been
in
some
degree
instrumental
that
oppressed
her
this
fear
increased
as
the
means
of
certainty
concerning
it
approached
and
when
she
came
within
view
of
theresaâ€™s
cottage
she
was
so
much
disordered
and
her
resolution
failed
her
so
entirely
that
unable
to
proceed
she
rested
on
a
bank
beside
her
path
where
as
she
sat
the
wind
that
groaned
sullenly
among
the
lofty
branches
above
seemed
to
her
melancholy
imagination
to
bear
the
sounds
of
distant
lamentation
and
in
the
pauses
of
the
gust
she
still
fancied
she
heard
the
feeble
and
far-off
notes
of
distress
attention
convinced
her
that
this
was
no
more
than
fancy
but
the
increasing
gloom
which
seemed
the
sudden
close
of
day
soon
warned
her
to
depart
and
with
faltering
steps
she
again
moved
toward
the
cottage
through
the
casement
appeared
the
cheerful
blaze
of
a
wood
fire
and
theresa
who
had
observed
emily
approaching
was
already
at
the
door
to
receive
her
â€œit
is
a
cold
evening
madamâ€
said
she
â€œstorms
are
coming
on
and
i
thought
you
would
like
a
fire
do
take
this
chair
by
the
hearthâ€
emily
thanking
her
for
this
consideration
sat
down
and
then
looking
in
her
face
on
which
the
wood
fire
threw
a
gleam
she
was
struck
with
its
expression
and
unable
to
speak
sunk
back
in
her
chair
with
a
countenance
so
full
of
woe
that
theresa
instantly
comprehended
the
occasion
of
it
but
she
remained
silent
â€œahâ€
said
emily
at
length
â€œit
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
ask
the
result
of
your
enquiry
your
silence
and
that
look
sufficiently
explain
itâ€”he
is
deadâ€
â€œalas
my
dear
young
ladyâ€
replied
theresa
while
tears
filled
her
eyes
â€œthis
world
is
made
up
of
trouble
the
rich
have
their
share
as
well
as
the
poor
but
we
must
all
endeavour
to
bear
what
heaven
pleasesâ€
â€œhe
is
dead
thenâ€â€”interrupted
emilyâ€”â€œvalancourt
is
deadâ€
â€œa-well-a-day
i
fear
he
isâ€
replied
theresa
â€œyou
fearâ€
said
emily
â€œdo
you
only
fearâ€
â€œalas
yes
madam
i
fear
he
is
neither
the
steward
nor
any
of
the
epourville
family
have
heard
of
him
since
he
left
languedoc
and
the
count
is
in
great
affliction
about
him
for
he
says
he
was
always
punctual
in
writing
but
that
now
he
has
not
received
a
line
from
him
since
he
left
languedoc
he
appointed
to
be
at
home
three
weeks
ago
but
he
has
neither
come
nor
written
and
they
fear
some
accident
has
befallen
him
alas
that
ever
i
should
live
to
cry
for
his
death
i
am
old
and
might
have
died
without
being
missed
but
heâ€â€”emily
was
faint
and
asked
for
some
water
and
theresa
alarmed
by
the
voice
in
which
she
spoke
hastened
to
her
assistance
and
while
she
held
the
water
to
emilyâ€™s
lips
continued
â€œmy
dear
young
mistress
do
not
take
it
so
to
heart
the
chevalier
may
be
alive
and
well
for
all
this
let
us
hope
the
bestâ€
â€œo
no
i
cannot
hopeâ€
said
emily
â€œi
am
acquainted
with
circumstances
that
will
not
suffer
me
to
hope
i
am
somewhat
better
now
and
can
hear
what
you
have
to
say
tell
me
i
entreat
the
particulars
of
what
you
knowâ€
â€œstay
till
you
are
a
little
better
mademoiselle
you
look
sadlyâ€
â€œo
no
theresa
tell
me
all
while
i
have
the
power
to
hear
itâ€
said
emily
â€œtell
me
all
i
conjure
youâ€
â€œwell
madam
i
will
then
but
the
steward
did
not
say
much
for
richard
says
he
seemed
shy
of
talking
about
mons
valancourt
and
what
he
gathered
was
from
gabriel
one
of
the
servants
who
said
he
had
heard
it
from
my
lordâ€™s
gentlemanâ€
â€œwhat
did
he
hearâ€
said
emily
â€œwhy
madam
richard
has
but
a
bad
memory
and
could
not
remember
half
of
it
and
if
i
had
not
asked
him
a
great
many
questions
i
should
have
heard
little
indeed
but
he
says
that
gabriel
said
that
he
and
all
the
other
servants
were
in
great
trouble
about
m
valancourt
for
that
he
was
such
a
kind
young
gentleman
they
all
loved
him
as
well
as
if
he
had
been
their
own
brotherâ€”and
now
to
think
what
was
become
of
him
for
he
used
to
be
so
courteous
to
them
all
and
if
any
of
them
had
been
in
fault
m
valancourt
was
the
first
to
persuade
my
lord
to
forgive
them
and
then
if
any
poor
family
was
in
distress
m
valancourt
was
the
first
too
to
relieve
them
though
some
folks
not
a
great
way
off
could
have
afforded
that
much
better
than
he
and
then
said
gabriel
he
was
so
gentle
to
everybody
and
for
all
he
had
such
a
noble
look
with
him
he
never
would
command
and
call
about
him
as
some
of
your
quality
people
do
and
we
never
minded
him
the
less
for
that
nay
says
gabriel
for
that
matter
we
minded
him
the
more
and
would
all
have
run
to
obey
him
at
a
word
sooner
than
if
some
folks
had
told
us
what
to
do
at
full
length
aye
and
were
more
afraid
of
displeasing
him
too
than
of
them
that
used
rough
words
to
usâ€
emily
who
no
longer
considered
it
to
be
dangerous
to
listen
to
praise
bestowed
on
valancourt
did
not
attempt
to
interrupt
theresa
but
sat
attentive
to
her
words
though
almost
overwhelmed
with
grief
â€œmy
lordâ€
continued
theresa
â€œfrets
about
m
valancourt
sadly
and
the
more
because
they
say
he
had
been
rather
harsh
against
him
lately
gabriel
says
he
had
it
from
my
lordâ€™s
valet
that
m
valancourt
had
comported
himself
wildly
at
paris
and
had
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
more
a
great
deal
than
my
lord
liked
for
he
loves
money
better
than
m
valancourt
who
had
been
led
astray
sadly
nay
for
that
matter
m
valancourt
had
been
put
into
prison
at
paris
and
my
lord
says
gabriel
refused
to
take
him
out
and
said
he
deserved
to
suffer
and
when
old
gregoire
the
butler
heard
of
this
he
actually
bought
a
walking-stick
to
take
with
him
to
paris
to
visit
his
young
master
but
the
next
thing
we
hear
is
that
m
valancourt
is
coming
home
o
it
was
a
joyful
day
when
he
came
but
he
was
sadly
altered
and
my
lord
looked
very
cool
upon
him
and
he
was
very
sad
indeed
and
soon
after
he
went
away
again
into
languedoc
and
since
that
time
we
have
never
seen
himâ€
theresa
paused
and
emily
sighing
deeply
remained
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
without
speaking
after
a
long
pause
she
enquired
what
further
theresa
had
heard
â€œyet
why
should
i
askâ€
she
added
â€œwhat
you
have
already
told
is
too
much
o
valancourt
thou
art
goneâ€”for
ever
gone
and
iâ€”i
have
murdered
theeâ€
these
words
and
the
countenance
of
despair
which
accompanied
them
alarmed
theresa
who
began
to
fear
that
the
shock
of
the
intelligence
emily
had
just
received
had
affected
her
senses
â€œmy
dear
young
lady
be
composedâ€
said
she
â€œand
do
not
say
such
frightful
words
you
murder
m
valancourtâ€”dear
heartâ€
emily
replied
only
by
a
heavy
sigh
â€œdear
lady
it
breaks
my
heart
to
see
you
look
soâ€
said
theresa
â€œdo
not
sit
with
your
eyes
upon
the
ground
and
all
so
pale
and
melancholy
it
frightens
me
to
see
youâ€
emily
was
still
silent
and
did
not
appear
to
hear
anything
that
was
said
to
her
â€œbesides
mademoiselleâ€
continued
theresa
â€œm
valancourt
may
be
alive
and
merry
yet
for
what
we
knowâ€
at
the
mention
of
his
name
emily
raised
her
eyes
and
fixed
them
in
a
wild
gaze
upon
theresa
as
if
she
was
endeavouring
to
understand
what
had
been
said
â€œaye
my
dear
ladyâ€
said
theresa
mistaking
the
meaning
of
this
considerate
air
â€œm
valancourt
may
be
alive
and
merry
yetâ€
on
the
repetition
of
these
words
emily
comprehended
their
import
but
instead
of
producing
the
effect
intended
they
seemed
only
to
heighten
her
distress
she
rose
hastily
from
her
chair
paced
the
little
room
with
quick
steps
and
often
sighing
deeply
clasped
her
hands
and
shuddered
meanwhile
theresa
with
simple
but
honest
affection
endeavoured
to
comfort
her
put
more
wood
on
the
fire
stirred
it
up
into
a
brighter
blaze
swept
the
hearth
set
the
chair
which
emily
had
left
in
a
warmer
situation
and
then
drew
forth
from
a
cupboard
a
flask
of
wine
â€œit
is
a
stormy
night
madamâ€
said
she
â€œand
blows
coldâ€”do
come
nearer
the
fire
and
take
a
glass
of
this
wine
it
will
comfort
you
as
it
has
done
me
often
and
often
for
it
is
not
such
wine
as
one
gets
every
day
it
is
rich
languedoc
and
the
last
of
six
flasks
that
m
valancourt
sent
me
the
night
before
he
left
gascony
for
paris
they
have
served
me
ever
since
as
cordials
and
i
never
drink
it
but
i
think
of
him
and
what
kind
words
he
said
to
me
when
he
gave
them
â€˜theresaâ€™
says
he
â€˜you
are
not
young
now
and
should
have
a
glass
of
good
wine
now
and
then
i
will
send
you
a
few
flasks
and
when
you
taste
them
you
will
sometimes
remember
me
your
friendâ€™
yesâ€”those
were
his
very
wordsâ€”me
your
friendâ€
emily
still
paced
the
room
without
seeming
to
hear
what
theresa
said
who
continued
speaking
â€œand
i
have
remembered
him
often
enough
poor
young
gentlemanâ€”for
he
gave
me
this
roof
for
a
shelter
and
that
which
has
supported
me
ah
he
is
in
heaven
with
my
blessed
master
if
ever
saint
wasâ€
theresaâ€™s
voice
faltered
she
wept
and
set
down
the
flask
unable
to
pour
out
the
wine
her
grief
seemed
to
recall
emily
from
her
own
who
went
towards
her
but
then
stopped
and
having
gazed
on
her
for
a
moment
turned
suddenly
away
as
if
overwhelmed
by
the
reflection
that
it
was
valancourt
whom
theresa
lamented
while
she
yet
paced
the
room
the
still
soft
note
of
an
oboe
or
flute
was
heard
mingling
with
the
blast
the
sweetness
of
which
affected
emilyâ€™s
spirits
she
paused
a
moment
in
attention
the
tender
tones
as
they
swelled
along
the
wind
till
they
were
lost
again
in
the
ruder
gust
came
with
a
plaintiveness
that
touched
her
heart
and
she
melted
into
tears
â€œayeâ€
said
theresa
drying
her
eyes
â€œthere
is
richard
our
neighbourâ€™s
son
playing
on
the
oboe
it
is
sad
enough
to
hear
such
sweet
music
nowâ€
emily
continued
to
weep
without
replying
â€œhe
often
plays
of
an
eveningâ€
added
theresa
â€œand
sometimes
the
young
folks
dance
to
the
sound
of
his
oboe
but
dear
young
lady
do
not
cry
so
and
pray
take
a
glass
of
this
wineâ€
continued
she
pouring
some
into
a
glass
and
handing
it
to
emily
who
reluctantly
took
it
â€œtaste
it
for
m
valancourtâ€™s
sakeâ€
said
theresa
as
emily
lifted
the
glass
to
her
lips
â€œfor
he
gave
it
me
you
know
madamâ€
emilyâ€™s
hand
trembled
and
she
spilt
the
wine
as
she
withdrew
it
from
her
lips
â€œfor
whose
sakeâ€”who
gave
the
wineâ€
said
she
in
a
faltering
voice
â€œm
valancourt
dear
lady
i
knew
you
would
be
pleased
with
it
it
is
the
last
flask
i
have
leftâ€
emily
set
the
wine
upon
the
table
and
burst
into
tears
while
theresa
disappointed
and
alarmed
tried
to
comfort
her
but
she
only
waved
her
hand
entreated
she
might
be
left
alone
and
wept
the
more
a
knock
at
the
cottage
door
prevented
theresa
from
immediately
obeying
her
mistress
and
she
was
going
to
open
it
when
emily
checking
her
requested
she
would
not
admit
any
person
but
afterwards
recollecting
that
she
had
ordered
her
servant
to
attend
her
home
she
said
it
was
only
philippe
and
endeavoured
to
restrain
her
tears
while
theresa
opened
the
door
a
voice
that
spoke
without
drew
emilyâ€™s
attention
she
listened
turned
her
eyes
to
the
door
when
a
person
now
appeared
and
immediately
a
bright
gleam
that
flashed
from
the
fire
discoveredâ€”valancourt
emily
on
perceiving
him
started
from
her
chair
trembled
and
sinking
into
it
again
became
insensible
to
all
around
her
a
scream
from
theresa
now
told
that
she
knew
valancourt
whom
her
imperfect
sight
and
the
duskiness
of
the
place
had
prevented
her
from
immediately
recollecting
but
his
attention
was
immediately
called
from
her
to
the
person
whom
he
saw
falling
from
a
chair
near
the
fire
and
hastening
to
her
assistanceâ€”he
perceived
that
he
was
supporting
emily
the
various
emotions
that
seized
him
upon
thus
unexpectedly
meeting
with
her
from
whom
he
had
believed
he
had
parted
for
ever
and
on
beholding
her
pale
and
lifeless
in
his
armsâ€”may
perhaps
be
imagined
though
they
could
neither
be
then
expressed
nor
now
described
any
more
than
emilyâ€™s
sensations
when
at
length
she
unclosed
her
eyes
and
looking
up
again
saw
valancourt
the
intense
anxiety
with
which
he
regarded
her
was
instantly
changed
to
an
expression
of
mingled
joy
and
tenderness
as
his
eye
met
hers
and
he
perceived
that
she
was
reviving
but
he
could
only
exclaim
â€œemilyâ€
as
he
silently
watched
her
recovery
while
she
averted
her
eye
and
feebly
attempted
to
withdraw
her
hand
but
in
these
the
first
moments
which
succeeded
to
the
pangs
his
supposed
death
had
occasioned
her
she
forgot
every
fault
which
had
formerly
claimed
indignation
and
beholding
valancourt
such
as
he
had
appeared
when
he
won
her
early
affection
she
experienced
emotions
of
only
tenderness
and
joy
this
alas
was
but
the
sunshine
of
a
few
short
moments
recollections
rose
like
clouds
upon
her
mind
and
darkening
the
illusive
image
that
possessed
it
she
again
beheld
valancourt
degradedâ€”valancourt
unworthy
of
the
esteem
and
tenderness
she
had
once
bestowed
upon
him
her
spirits
faltered
and
withdrawing
her
hand
she
turned
from
him
to
conceal
her
grief
while
he
yet
more
embarrassed
and
agitated
remained
silent
a
sense
of
what
she
owed
to
herself
restrained
her
tears
and
taught
her
soon
to
overcome
in
some
degree
the
emotions
of
mingled
joy
and
sorrow
that
contended
at
her
heart
as
she
rose
and
having
thanked
him
for
the
assistance
he
had
given
her
bade
theresa
good
evening
as
she
was
leaving
the
cottage
valancourt
who
seemed
suddenly
awakened
as
from
a
dream
entreated
in
a
voice
that
pleaded
powerfully
for
compassion
a
few
moments
attention
emilyâ€™s
heart
perhaps
pleaded
as
powerfully
but
she
had
resolution
enough
to
resist
both
together
with
the
clamorous
entreaties
of
theresa
that
she
would
not
venture
home
alone
in
the
dark
and
had
already
opened
the
cottage
door
when
the
pelting
storm
compelled
her
to
obey
their
requests
silent
and
embarrassed
she
returned
to
the
fire
while
valancourt
with
increasing
agitation
paced
the
room
as
if
he
wished
yet
feared
to
speak
and
theresa
expressed
without
restraint
her
joy
and
wonder
upon
seeing
him
â€œdear
heart
sirâ€
said
she
â€œi
never
was
so
surprised
and
overjoyed
in
my
life
we
were
in
great
tribulation
before
you
came
for
we
thought
you
were
dead
and
were
talking
and
lamenting
about
you
just
when
you
knocked
at
the
door
my
young
mistress
there
was
crying
fit
to
break
her
heartâ€”â€
emily
looked
with
much
displeasure
at
theresa
but
before
she
could
speak
valancourt
unable
to
repress
the
emotion
which
theresaâ€™s
imprudent
discovery
occasioned
exclaimed
â€œo
my
emily
am
i
then
still
dear
to
you
did
you
indeed
honour
me
with
a
thoughtâ€”a
tear
o
heavens
you
weepâ€”you
weep
nowâ€
â€œtheresa
sirâ€
said
emily
with
a
reserved
air
and
trying
to
conquer
her
tears
â€œhas
reason
to
remember
you
with
gratitude
and
she
was
concerned
because
she
had
not
lately
heard
of
you
allow
me
to
thank
you
for
the
kindness
you
have
shown
her
and
to
say
that
since
i
am
now
upon
the
spot
she
must
not
be
further
indebted
to
youâ€
â€œemilyâ€
said
valancourt
no
longer
master
of
his
emotions
â€œis
it
thus
you
meet
him
whom
once
you
meant
to
honour
with
your
handâ€”thus
you
meet
him
who
has
loved
youâ€”suffered
for
youâ€”yet
what
do
i
say
pardon
me
pardon
me
mademoiselle
st
aubert
i
know
not
what
i
utter
i
have
no
longer
any
claim
upon
your
remembranceâ€”i
have
forfeited
every
pretension
to
your
esteem
your
love
yes
let
me
not
forget
that
i
once
possessed
your
affections
though
to
know
that
i
have
lost
them
is
my
severest
affliction
afflictionâ€”do
i
call
itâ€”that
is
a
term
of
mildnessâ€
â€œdear
heartâ€
said
theresa
preventing
emily
from
replying
â€œtalk
of
once
having
her
affections
why
my
dear
young
lady
loves
you
now
better
than
she
does
anybody
in
the
whole
world
though
she
pretends
to
deny
itâ€
â€œthis
is
insupportableâ€
said
emily
â€œtheresa
you
know
not
what
you
say
sir
if
you
respect
my
tranquillity
you
will
spare
me
from
the
continuance
of
this
distressâ€
â€œi
do
respect
your
tranquillity
too
much
voluntarily
to
interrupt
itâ€
replied
valancourt
in
whose
bosom
pride
now
contended
with
tenderness
â€œand
will
not
be
a
voluntary
intruder
i
would
have
entreated
a
few
moments
attentionâ€”yet
i
know
not
for
what
purpose
you
have
ceased
to
esteem
me
and
to
recount
to
you
my
sufferings
will
degrade
me
more
without
exciting
even
your
pity
yet
i
have
been
o
emily
i
am
indeed
very
wretchedâ€
added
valancourt
in
a
voice
that
softened
from
solemnity
into
grief
â€œwhat
is
my
dear
young
master
going
out
in
all
this
rainâ€
said
theresa
â€œno
he
shall
not
stir
a
step
dear
dear
to
see
how
gentlefolks
can
afford
to
throw
away
their
happiness
now
if
you
were
poor
people
there
would
be
none
of
this
to
talk
of
unworthiness
and
not
caring
about
one
another
when
i
know
there
are
not
such
a
kind-hearted
lady
and
gentleman
in
the
whole
province
nor
any
that
love
one
another
half
so
well
if
the
truth
was
spokenâ€
emily
in
extreme
vexation
now
rose
from
her
chair
â€œi
must
be
goneâ€
said
she
â€œthe
storm
is
overâ€
â€œstay
emily
stay
mademoiselle
st
aubertâ€
said
valancourt
summoning
all
his
resolution
â€œi
will
no
longer
distress
you
by
my
presence
forgive
me
that
i
did
not
sooner
obey
you
and
if
you
can
sometimes
pity
one
who
in
losing
youâ€”has
lost
all
hope
of
peace
may
you
be
happy
emily
however
wretched
i
remain
happy
as
my
fondest
wish
would
have
youâ€
his
voice
faltered
with
the
last
words
and
his
countenance
changed
while
with
a
look
of
ineffable
tenderness
and
grief
he
gazed
upon
her
for
an
instant
and
then
quitted
the
cottage
â€œdear
heart
dear
heartâ€
cried
theresa
following
him
to
the
door
â€œwhy
monsieur
valancourt
how
it
rains
what
a
night
is
this
to
turn
him
out
in
why
it
will
give
him
his
death
and
it
was
but
now
you
were
crying
mademoiselle
because
he
was
dead
well
young
ladies
do
change
their
mind
in
a
minute
as
one
may
sayâ€
emily
made
no
reply
for
she
heard
not
what
was
said
while
lost
in
sorrow
and
thought
she
remained
in
her
chair
by
the
fire
with
her
eyes
fixed
and
the
image
of
valancourt
still
before
them
â€œm
valancourt
is
sadly
altered
madamâ€
said
theresa
â€œhe
looks
so
thin
to
what
he
used
to
do
and
so
melancholy
and
then
he
wears
his
arm
in
a
slingâ€
emily
raised
her
eyes
at
these
words
for
she
had
not
observed
this
last
circumstance
and
she
now
did
not
doubt
that
valancourt
had
received
the
shot
of
her
gardener
at
thoulouse
with
this
conviction
her
pity
for
him
returning
she
blamed
herself
for
having
occasioned
him
to
leave
the
cottage
during
the
storm
soon
after
her
servants
arrived
with
the
carriage
and
emily
having
censured
theresa
for
her
thoughtless
conversation
to
valancourt
and
strictly
charging
her
never
to
repeat
any
hints
of
the
same
kind
to
him
withdrew
to
her
home
thoughtful
and
disconsolate
meanwhile
valancourt
had
returned
to
a
little
inn
of
the
village
whither
he
had
arrived
only
a
few
moments
before
his
visit
to
theresaâ€™s
cottage
on
the
way
from
thoulouse
to
the
chã¢teau
of
the
count
de
duvarney
where
he
had
not
been
since
he
bade
adieu
to
emily
at
chã¢teau-le-blanc
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
he
had
lingered
for
a
considerable
time
unable
to
summon
resolution
enough
to
quit
a
place
that
contained
the
object
most
dear
to
his
heart
there
were
times
indeed
when
grief
and
despair
urged
him
to
appear
again
before
emily
and
regardless
of
his
ruined
circumstances
to
renew
his
suit
pride
however
and
the
tenderness
of
his
affection
which
could
not
long
endure
the
thought
of
involving
her
in
his
misfortunes
at
length
so
far
triumphed
over
passion
that
he
relinquished
this
desperate
design
and
quitted
chã¢teau-le-blanc
but
still
his
fancy
wandered
among
the
scenes
which
had
witnessed
his
early
love
and
on
his
way
to
gascony
he
stopped
at
thoulouse
where
he
remained
when
emily
arrived
concealing
yet
indulging
his
melancholy
in
the
gardens
where
he
had
formerly
passed
with
her
so
many
happy
hours
often
recurring
with
vain
regret
to
the
evening
before
her
departure
for
italy
when
she
had
so
unexpectedly
met
him
on
the
terrace
and
endeavouring
to
recall
to
his
memory
every
word
and
look
which
had
then
charmed
him
the
arguments
he
had
employed
to
dissuade
her
from
the
journey
and
the
tenderness
of
their
last
farewell
in
such
melancholy
recollections
he
had
been
indulging
when
emily
unexpectedly
arrived
to
him
on
this
very
terrace
the
evening
after
her
arrival
at
thoulouse
his
emotions
on
thus
seeing
her
can
scarcely
be
imagined
but
he
so
far
overcame
the
first
promptings
of
love
that
he
forbore
to
discover
himself
and
abruptly
quitted
the
gardens
still
however
the
vision
he
had
seen
haunted
his
mind
he
became
more
wretched
than
before
and
the
only
solace
of
his
sorrow
was
to
return
in
the
silence
of
the
night
to
follow
the
paths
which
he
believed
her
steps
had
pressed
during
the
day
and
to
watch
round
the
habitation
where
she
reposed
it
was
in
one
of
these
mournful
wanderings
that
he
had
received
by
the
fire
of
the
gardener
who
mistook
him
for
a
robber
a
wound
in
his
arm
which
had
detained
him
at
thoulouse
till
very
lately
under
the
hands
of
a
surgeon
there
regardless
of
himself
and
careless
of
his
friends
whose
late
unkindness
had
urged
him
to
believe
that
they
were
indifferent
as
to
his
fate
he
remained
without
informing
them
of
his
situation
and
now
being
sufficiently
recovered
to
bear
travelling
he
had
taken
la
vallã©e
in
his
way
to
estuviã¨re
the
countâ€™s
residence
partly
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
of
emily
and
of
being
again
near
her
and
partly
for
that
of
enquiring
into
the
situation
of
poor
old
theresa
who
he
had
reason
to
suppose
had
been
deprived
of
her
stipend
small
as
it
was
and
which
enquiry
had
brought
him
to
her
cottage
when
emily
happened
to
be
there
this
unexpected
interview
which
had
at
once
shown
him
the
tenderness
of
her
love
and
the
strength
of
her
resolution
renewed
all
the
acuteness
of
the
despair
that
had
attended
their
former
separation
and
which
no
effort
of
reason
could
teach
him
in
these
moments
to
subdue
her
image
her
look
the
tones
of
her
voice
all
dwelt
on
his
fancy
as
powerfully
as
they
had
late
appeared
to
his
senses
and
banished
from
his
heart
every
emotion
except
those
of
love
and
despair
before
the
evening
concluded
he
returned
to
theresaâ€™s
cottage
that
he
might
hear
her
talk
of
emily
and
be
in
the
place
where
she
had
so
lately
been
the
joy
felt
and
expressed
by
that
faithful
servant
was
quickly
changed
to
sorrow
when
she
observed
at
one
moment
his
wild
and
frenzied
look
and
at
another
the
dark
melancholy
that
overhung
him
after
he
had
listened
and
for
a
considerable
time
to
all
she
had
to
relate
concerning
emily
he
gave
theresa
nearly
all
the
money
he
had
about
him
though
she
repeatedly
refused
it
declaring
that
her
mistress
had
amply
supplied
her
wants
and
then
drawing
a
ring
of
value
from
his
finger
he
delivered
it
her
with
a
solemn
charge
to
present
it
to
emily
of
whom
he
entreated
as
a
last
favour
that
she
would
preserve
it
for
his
sake
and
sometimes
when
she
looked
upon
it
remember
the
unhappy
giver
theresa
wept
as
she
received
the
ring
but
it
was
more
from
sympathy
than
from
any
presentiment
of
evil
and
before
she
could
reply
valancourt
abruptly
left
the
cottage
she
followed
him
to
the
door
calling
upon
his
name
and
entreating
him
to
return
but
she
received
no
answer
and
saw
him
no
more
call
up
him
that
left
half
told
the
story
of
cambuscan
bold
milton
on
the
following
morning
as
emily
sat
in
the
parlour
adjoining
the
library
reflecting
on
the
scene
of
the
preceding
night
annette
rushed
wildly
into
the
room
and
without
speaking
sunk
breathless
into
a
chair
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
answer
the
anxious
enquiries
of
emily
as
to
the
occasion
of
her
emotion
but
at
length
she
exclaimed
â€œi
have
seen
his
ghost
madam
i
have
seen
his
ghostâ€
â€œwho
do
you
meanâ€
said
emily
with
extreme
impatience
â€œit
came
in
from
the
hall
madamâ€
continued
annette
â€œas
i
was
crossing
to
the
parlourâ€
â€œwho
are
you
speaking
ofâ€
repeated
emily
â€œwho
came
in
from
the
hallâ€
â€œit
was
dressed
just
as
i
have
seen
him
often
and
oftenâ€
added
annette
â€œah
who
could
have
thoughtâ€”â€
emilyâ€™s
patience
was
now
exhausted
and
she
was
reprimanding
her
for
such
idle
fancies
when
a
servant
entered
the
room
and
informed
her
that
a
stranger
without
begged
leave
to
speak
with
her
it
immediately
occurred
to
emily
that
this
stranger
was
valancourt
and
she
told
the
servant
to
inform
him
that
she
was
engaged
and
could
not
see
any
person
the
servant
having
delivered
his
message
returned
with
one
from
the
stranger
urging
the
first
request
and
saying
that
he
had
something
of
consequence
to
communicate
while
annette
who
had
hitherto
sat
silent
and
amazed
now
started
up
and
crying
â€œit
is
ludovicoâ€”it
is
ludovicoâ€
ran
out
of
the
room
emily
bade
the
servant
follow
her
and
if
it
really
was
ludovico
to
show
him
into
the
parlour
in
a
few
minutes
ludovico
appeared
accompanied
by
annette
who
as
joy
rendered
her
forgetful
of
all
rules
of
decorum
towards
her
mistress
would
not
suffer
any
person
to
be
heard
for
some
time
but
herself
emily
expressed
surprise
and
satisfaction
on
seeing
ludovico
in
safety
and
the
first
emotions
increased
when
he
delivered
letters
from
count
de
villefort
and
the
lady
blanche
informing
her
of
their
late
adventure
and
of
their
present
situation
at
an
inn
among
the
pyrenees
where
they
had
been
detained
by
the
illness
of
mons
st
foix
and
the
indisposition
of
blanche
who
added
that
the
baron
st
foix
was
just
arrived
to
attend
his
son
to
his
chã¢teau
where
he
would
remain
till
the
perfect
recovery
of
his
wounds
and
then
return
to
languedoc
but
that
her
father
and
herself
purposed
to
be
at
la
vallã©e
on
the
following
day
she
added
that
emilyâ€™s
presence
would
be
expected
at
the
approaching
nuptials
and
begged
she
would
be
prepared
to
proceed
in
a
few
days
to
chã¢teau-le-blanc
for
an
account
of
ludovicoâ€™s
adventure
she
referred
her
to
himself
and
emily
though
much
interested
concerning
the
means
by
which
he
had
disappeared
from
the
north
apartments
had
the
forbearance
to
suspend
the
gratification
of
her
curiosity
till
he
had
taken
some
refreshment
and
had
conversed
with
annette
whose
joy
on
seeing
him
in
safety
could
not
have
been
more
extravagant
had
he
arisen
from
the
grave
meanwhile
emily
perused
again
the
letters
of
her
friends
whose
expressions
of
esteem
and
kindness
were
very
necessary
consolations
to
her
heart
awakened
as
it
was
by
the
late
interview
to
emotions
of
keener
sorrow
and
regret
the
invitation
to
chã¢teau-le-blanc
was
pressed
with
so
much
kindness
by
the
count
and
his
daughter
who
strengthened
it
by
a
message
from
the
countess
and
the
occasion
of
it
was
so
important
to
her
friend
that
emily
could
not
refuse
to
accept
it
nor
though
she
wished
to
remain
in
the
quiet
shades
of
her
native
home
could
she
avoid
perceiving
the
impropriety
of
remaining
there
alone
since
valancourt
was
again
in
the
neighbourhood
sometimes
too
she
thought
that
change
of
scenery
and
the
society
of
her
friends
might
contribute
more
than
retirement
to
restore
her
to
tranquillity
when
ludovico
again
appeared
she
desired
him
to
give
a
detail
of
his
adventure
in
the
north
apartments
and
to
tell
by
what
means
he
became
a
companion
of
the
banditti
with
whom
the
count
had
found
him
he
immediately
obeyed
while
annette
who
had
not
yet
had
leisure
to
ask
him
many
questions
on
the
subject
prepared
to
listen
with
a
countenance
of
extreme
curiosity
venturing
to
remind
her
lady
of
her
incredulity
concerning
spirits
in
the
castle
of
udolpho
and
of
her
own
sagacity
in
believing
in
them
while
emily
blushing
at
the
consciousness
of
her
late
credulity
observed
that
if
ludovicoâ€™s
adventure
could
justify
annetteâ€™s
superstition
he
had
probably
not
been
here
to
relate
it
ludovico
smiled
at
annette
and
bowed
to
emily
and
then
began
as
follows
â€œyou
may
remember
madam
that
on
the
night
when
i
sat
up
in
the
north
chamber
my
lord
the
count
and
mons
henri
accompanied
me
thither
and
that
while
they
remained
there
nothing
happened
to
excite
any
alarm
when
they
were
gone
i
made
a
fire
in
the
bedroom
and
not
being
inclined
to
sleep
i
sat
down
on
the
hearth
with
a
book
i
had
brought
with
me
to
divert
my
mind
i
confess
i
did
sometimes
look
round
the
chamber
with
something
like
apprehensionâ€”â€
â€œo
very
like
it
i
dare
sayâ€
interrupted
annette
â€œand
i
dare
say
too
if
the
truth
was
known
you
shook
from
head
to
footâ€
â€œnot
quite
so
bad
as
thatâ€
replied
ludovico
smiling
â€œbut
several
times
as
the
wind
whistled
round
the
castle
and
shook
the
old
casements
i
did
fancy
i
heard
odd
noises
and
once
or
twice
i
got
up
and
looked
about
me
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
except
the
grim
figures
in
the
tapestry
which
seemed
to
frown
upon
me
as
i
looked
at
them
i
had
sat
thus
for
above
an
hourâ€
continued
ludovico
â€œwhen
again
i
thought
i
heard
a
noise
and
glanced
my
eyes
round
the
room
to
discover
what
it
came
from
but
not
perceiving
anything
i
began
to
read
again
and
when
i
had
finished
the
story
i
was
upon
i
felt
drowsy
and
dropped
asleep
but
presently
i
was
awakened
by
the
noise
i
had
heard
before
and
it
seemed
to
come
from
that
part
of
the
chamber
where
the
bed
stood
and
then
whether
it
was
the
story
i
had
been
reading
that
affected
my
spirits
or
the
strange
reports
that
had
been
spread
of
these
apartments
i
donâ€™t
know
but
when
i
looked
towards
the
bed
again
i
fancied
i
saw
a
manâ€™s
face
within
the
dusky
curtainsâ€
at
the
mention
of
this
emily
trembled
and
looked
anxiously
remembering
the
spectacle
she
had
herself
witnessed
there
with
dorothã©e
â€œi
confess
madam
my
heart
did
fail
me
at
that
instantâ€
continued
ludovico
â€œbut
a
return
of
the
noise
drew
my
attention
from
the
bed
and
i
then
distinctly
heard
a
sound
like
that
of
a
key
turning
in
a
lock
but
what
surprised
me
more
was
that
i
saw
no
door
where
the
sound
seemed
to
come
from
in
the
next
moment
however
the
arras
near
the
bed
was
slowly
lifted
and
a
person
appeared
behind
it
entering
from
a
small
door
in
the
wall
he
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
half
retreating
with
his
head
bending
under
the
arras
which
concealed
the
upper
part
of
his
face
except
his
eyes
scowling
beneath
the
tapestry
as
he
held
it
and
then
while
he
raised
it
higher
i
saw
the
face
of
another
man
behind
looking
over
his
shoulder
i
know
not
how
it
was
but
though
my
sword
was
upon
the
table
before
me
i
had
not
the
power
just
then
to
seize
it
but
sat
quite
still
watching
them
with
my
eyes
half
shut
as
if
i
was
asleep
i
suppose
they
thought
me
so
and
were
debating
what
they
should
do
for
i
heard
them
whisper
and
they
stood
in
the
same
posture
for
the
value
of
a
minute
and
then
i
thought
i
perceived
other
faces
in
the
duskiness
beyond
the
door
and
heard
louder
whispersâ€
â€œthis
door
surprises
meâ€
said
emily
â€œbecause
i
understood
that
the
count
had
caused
the
arras
to
be
lifted
and
the
walls
examined
suspecting
that
they
might
have
concealed
a
passage
through
which
you
had
departedâ€
â€œit
does
not
appear
so
extraordinary
to
me
madamâ€
replied
ludovico
â€œthat
this
door
should
escape
notice
because
it
was
formed
in
a
narrow
compartment
which
appeared
to
be
part
of
the
outward
wall
and
if
the
count
had
not
passed
over
it
he
might
have
thought
it
was
useless
to
search
for
a
door
where
it
seemed
as
if
no
passage
could
communicate
with
one
but
the
truth
was
that
the
passage
was
formed
within
the
wall
itselfâ€”but
to
return
to
the
men
whom
i
saw
obscurely
beyond
the
door
and
who
did
not
suffer
me
to
remain
long
in
suspense
concerning
their
design
they
all
rushed
into
the
room
and
surrounded
me
though
not
before
i
had
snatched
up
my
sword
to
defend
myself
but
what
could
one
man
do
against
four
they
soon
disarmed
me
and
having
fastened
my
arms
and
gagged
my
mouth
forced
me
through
the
private
door
leaving
my
sword
upon
the
table
to
assist
as
they
said
those
who
should
come
in
the
morning
to
look
for
me
in
fighting
against
the
ghosts
they
then
led
me
through
many
narrow
passages
cut
as
i
fancied
in
the
walls
for
i
had
never
seen
them
before
and
down
several
flights
of
steps
till
we
came
to
the
vaults
underneath
the
castle
and
then
opening
a
stone
door
which
i
should
have
taken
for
the
wall
itself
we
went
through
a
long
passage
and
down
other
steps
cut
in
the
solid
rock
when
another
door
delivered
us
into
a
cave
after
turning
and
twining
about
for
some
time
we
reached
the
mouth
of
it
and
i
found
myself
on
the
sea-beach
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
with
the
chã¢teau
above
a
boat
was
in
waiting
into
which
the
ruffians
got
forcing
me
along
with
them
and
we
soon
reached
a
small
vessel
that
was
at
anchor
where
other
men
appeared
when
setting
me
aboard
two
of
the
fellows
who
had
seized
me
followed
and
the
other
two
rowed
back
to
the
shore
while
we
set
sail
i
soon
found
out
what
all
this
meant
and
what
was
the
business
of
these
men
at
the
chã¢teau
we
landed
in
rousillon
and
after
lingering
several
days
about
the
shore
some
of
their
comrades
came
down
from
the
mountains
and
carried
me
with
them
to
the
fort
where
i
remained
till
my
lord
so
unexpectedly
arrived
for
they
had
taken
good
care
to
prevent
my
running
away
having
blindfolded
me
during
the
journey
and
if
they
had
not
done
this
i
think
i
never
could
have
found
my
road
to
any
town
through
the
wild
country
we
traversed
after
i
reached
the
fort
i
was
watched
like
a
prisoner
and
never
suffered
to
go
out
without
two
or
three
companions
and
i
became
so
weary
of
life
that
i
often
wished
to
get
rid
of
itâ€
â€œwell
but
they
let
you
talkâ€
said
annette
â€œthey
did
not
gagg
you
after
they
got
you
away
from
the
chã¢teau
so
i
donâ€™t
see
what
reason
there
was
to
be
so
very
weary
of
living
to
say
nothing
about
the
chance
you
had
of
seeing
me
againâ€
ludovico
smiled
and
emily
also
who
enquired
what
was
the
motive
of
these
men
for
carrying
him
off
â€œi
soon
found
out
madamâ€
resumed
ludovico
â€œthat
they
were
pirates
who
had
during
many
years
secreted
their
spoil
in
the
vaults
of
the
castle
which
being
so
near
the
sea
suited
their
purpose
well
to
prevent
detection
they
had
tried
to
have
it
believed
that
the
chã¢teau
was
haunted
and
having
discovered
the
private
way
to
the
north
apartments
which
had
been
shut
up
ever
since
the
death
of
the
lady
marchioness
they
easily
succeeded
the
housekeeper
and
her
husband
who
were
the
only
persons
that
had
inhabited
the
castle
for
some
years
were
so
terrified
by
the
strange
noises
they
heard
in
the
nights
that
they
would
live
there
no
longer
a
report
soon
went
abroad
that
it
was
haunted
and
the
whole
country
believed
this
the
more
readily
i
suppose
because
it
had
been
said
that
the
lady
marchioness
had
died
in
a
strange
way
and
because
my
lord
never
would
return
to
the
place
afterwardsâ€
â€œbut
whyâ€
said
emily
â€œwere
not
these
pirates
contented
with
the
caveâ€”why
did
they
think
it
necessary
to
deposit
their
spoil
in
the
castleâ€
â€œthe
cave
madamâ€
replied
ludovico
â€œwas
open
to
anybody
and
their
treasures
would
not
long
have
remained
undiscovered
there
but
in
the
vaults
they
were
secure
so
long
as
the
report
prevailed
of
their
being
haunted
thus
then
it
appears
that
they
brought
at
midnight
the
spoil
they
took
on
the
seas
and
kept
it
till
they
had
opportunities
of
disposing
of
it
to
advantage
the
pirates
were
connected
with
spanish
smugglers
and
banditti
who
live
among
the
wilds
of
the
pyrenees
and
carry
on
various
kinds
of
traffic
such
as
nobody
would
think
of
and
with
this
desperate
horde
of
banditti
i
remained
till
my
lord
arrived
i
shall
never
forget
what
i
felt
when
i
first
discovered
himâ€”i
almost
gave
him
up
for
lost
but
i
knew
that
if
i
showed
myself
the
banditti
would
discover
who
he
was
and
probably
murder
us
all
to
prevent
their
secret
in
the
chã¢teau
being
detected
i
therefore
kept
out
of
my
lordâ€™s
sight
but
had
a
strict
watch
upon
the
ruffians
and
determined
if
they
offered
him
or
his
family
violence
to
discover
myself
and
fight
for
our
lives
soon
after
i
overheard
some
of
them
laying
a
most
diabolical
plan
for
the
murder
and
plunder
of
the
whole
party
when
i
contrived
to
speak
to
some
of
my
lordâ€™s
attendants
telling
them
what
was
going
forward
and
we
consulted
what
was
best
to
be
done
meanwhile
my
lord
alarmed
at
the
absence
of
the
lady
blanche
demanded
her
and
the
ruffians
having
given
some
unsatisfactory
answer
my
lord
and
mons
st
foix
became
furious
so
then
we
thought
it
a
good
time
to
discover
the
plot
and
rushing
into
the
chamber
i
called
out
â€˜treachery
my
lord
count
defend
yourselfâ€™
his
lordship
and
the
chevalier
drew
their
swords
directly
and
a
hard
battle
we
had
but
we
conquered
at
last
as
madam
you
are
already
informed
of
by
my
lord
countâ€
â€œthis
is
an
extraordinary
adventureâ€
said
emily
â€œand
much
praise
is
due
ludovico
to
your
prudence
and
intrepidity
there
are
some
circumstances
however
concerning
the
north
apartments
which
still
perplex
me
but
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
explain
them
did
you
ever
hear
the
banditti
relate
anything
extraordinary
of
these
roomsâ€
â€œno
madamâ€
replied
ludovico
â€œi
never
heard
them
speak
about
the
rooms
except
to
laugh
at
the
credulity
of
the
old
housekeeper
who
once
was
very
near
catching
one
of
the
pirates
it
was
since
the
count
arrived
at
the
chã¢teau
he
said
and
he
laughed
heartily
as
he
related
the
trick
he
had
played
offâ€
a
blush
overspread
emilyâ€™s
cheek
and
she
impatiently
desired
ludovico
to
explain
himself
â€œwhy
my
ladyâ€
said
he
â€œas
this
fellow
was
one
night
in
the
bedroom
he
heard
somebody
approaching
through
the
next
apartment
and
not
having
time
to
lift
up
the
arras
and
unfasten
the
door
he
hid
himself
in
the
bed
just
by
there
he
lay
for
some
time
in
as
great
a
fright
i
supposeâ€”â€
â€œas
you
were
inâ€
interrupted
annette
â€œwhen
you
sat
up
so
boldly
to
watch
by
yourselfâ€
â€œayeâ€
said
ludovico
â€œin
as
great
a
fright
as
he
ever
made
anybody
else
suffer
and
presently
the
housekeeper
and
some
other
person
came
up
to
the
bed
when
he
thinking
they
were
going
to
examine
it
bethought
him
that
his
only
chance
of
escaping
detection
was
by
terrifying
them
so
he
lifted
up
the
counterpane
but
that
did
not
do
till
he
raised
his
face
above
it
and
then
they
both
set
off
he
said
as
if
they
had
seen
the
devil
and
he
got
out
of
the
rooms
undiscoveredâ€
emily
could
not
forbear
smiling
at
this
explanation
of
the
deception
which
had
given
her
so
much
superstitious
terror
and
was
surprised
that
she
could
have
suffered
herself
to
be
thus
alarmed
till
she
considered
that
when
the
mind
has
once
begun
to
yield
to
the
weakness
of
superstition
trifles
impress
it
with
the
force
of
conviction
still
however
she
remembered
with
awe
the
mysterious
music
which
had
been
heard
at
midnight
near
chã¢teau-le-blanc
and
she
asked
ludovico
if
he
could
give
any
explanation
of
it
but
he
could
not
â€œi
only
know
madamâ€
he
added
â€œthat
it
did
not
belong
to
the
pirates
for
i
have
heard
them
laugh
about
it
and
say
they
believed
the
devil
was
in
league
with
them
thereâ€
â€œyes
i
will
answer
for
it
he
wasâ€
said
annette
her
countenance
brightening
â€œi
was
sure
all
along
that
he
or
his
spirits
had
something
to
do
with
the
north
apartments
and
now
you
see
madam
i
am
right
at
lastâ€
â€œit
cannot
be
denied
that
his
spirits
were
very
busy
in
that
part
of
the
chã¢teauâ€
replied
emily
smiling
â€œbut
i
am
surprised
ludovico
that
these
pirates
should
persevere
in
their
schemes
after
the
arrival
of
the
count
what
could
they
expect
but
certain
detectionâ€
â€œi
have
reason
to
believe
madamâ€
replied
ludovico
â€œthat
it
was
their
intention
to
persevere
no
longer
than
was
necessary
for
the
removal
of
the
stores
which
were
deposited
in
the
vaults
and
it
appeared
that
they
had
been
employed
in
doing
so
from
within
a
short
period
after
the
countâ€™s
arrival
but
as
they
had
only
a
few
hours
in
the
night
for
this
business
and
were
carrying
on
other
schemes
at
the
same
time
the
vaults
were
not
above
half
emptied
when
they
took
me
away
they
gloried
exceedingly
in
this
opportunity
of
confirming
the
superstitious
reports
that
had
been
spread
of
the
north
chambers
were
careful
to
leave
everything
there
as
they
had
found
it
the
better
to
promote
the
deception
and
frequently
in
their
jocose
moods
would
laugh
at
the
consternation
which
they
believed
the
inhabitants
of
the
castle
had
suffered
upon
my
disappearing
and
it
was
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
my
betraying
their
secret
that
they
had
removed
me
to
such
a
distance
from
that
period
they
considered
the
chã¢teau
as
nearly
their
own
but
i
found
from
the
discourse
of
their
comrades
that
though
they
were
cautious
at
first
in
showing
their
power
there
they
had
once
very
nearly
betrayed
themselves
going
one
night
as
was
their
custom
to
the
north
chambers
to
repeat
the
noises
that
had
occasioned
such
alarm
among
the
servants
they
heard
as
they
were
about
to
unfasten
the
secret
door
voices
in
the
bedroom
my
lord
has
since
told
me
that
himself
and
m
henri
were
then
in
the
apartment
and
they
heard
very
extraordinary
sounds
of
lamentation
which
it
seems
were
made
by
these
fellows
with
their
usual
design
of
spreading
terror
and
my
lord
has
owned
he
then
felt
somewhat
more
than
surprise
but
as
it
was
necessary
to
the
peace
of
his
family
that
no
notice
should
be
taken
he
was
silent
on
the
subject
and
enjoined
silence
to
his
sonâ€
emily
recollecting
the
change
that
had
appeared
in
the
spirits
of
the
count
after
the
night
when
he
had
watched
in
the
north
room
now
perceived
the
cause
of
it
and
having
made
some
further
enquiries
upon
this
strange
affair
she
dismissed
ludovico
and
went
to
give
orders
for
the
accommodation
of
her
friends
on
the
following
day
in
the
evening
theresa
lame
as
she
was
came
to
deliver
the
ring
with
which
valancourt
had
entrusted
her
and
when
she
presented
it
emily
was
much
affected
for
she
remembered
to
have
seen
him
wear
it
often
in
happier
days
she
was
however
much
displeased
that
theresa
had
received
it
and
positively
refused
to
accept
it
herself
though
to
have
done
so
would
have
afforded
her
a
melancholy
pleasure
theresa
entreated
expostulated
and
then
described
the
distress
of
valancourt
when
he
had
given
the
ring
and
repeated
the
message
with
which
he
had
commissioned
her
to
deliver
it
and
emily
could
not
conceal
the
extreme
sorrow
this
recital
occasioned
her
but
wept
and
remained
lost
in
thought
â€œalas
my
dear
young
ladyâ€
said
theresa
â€œwhy
should
all
this
be
i
have
known
you
from
your
infancy
and
it
may
well
be
supposed
i
love
you
as
if
you
were
my
own
and
wish
as
much
to
see
you
happy
m
valancourt
to
be
sure
i
have
not
known
so
long
but
then
i
have
reason
to
love
him
as
though
he
was
my
own
son
i
know
how
well
you
love
one
another
or
why
all
this
weeping
and
wailingâ€
emily
waved
her
hand
for
theresa
to
be
silent
who
disregarding
the
signal
continued
â€œand
how
much
you
are
alike
in
your
tempers
and
ways
and
that
if
you
were
married
you
would
be
the
happiest
couple
in
the
whole
provinceâ€”then
what
is
there
to
prevent
your
marrying
dear
dear
to
see
how
some
people
fling
away
their
happiness
and
then
cry
and
lament
about
it
just
as
if
it
was
not
their
own
doing
and
as
if
there
was
more
pleasure
in
wailing
and
weeping
than
in
being
at
peace
learning
to
be
sure
is
a
fine
thing
but
if
it
teaches
folks
no
better
than
that
why
i
had
rather
be
without
it
if
it
would
teach
them
to
be
happier
i
would
say
something
to
it
then
it
would
be
learning
and
wisdom
tooâ€
age
and
long
services
had
given
theresa
a
privilege
to
talk
but
emily
now
endeavoured
to
check
her
loquacity
and
though
she
felt
the
justness
of
some
of
her
remarks
did
not
choose
to
explain
the
circumstances
that
had
determined
her
conduct
towards
valancourt
she
therefore
only
told
theresa
that
it
would
much
displease
her
to
hear
the
subject
renewed
that
she
had
reasons
for
her
conduct
which
she
did
not
think
it
proper
to
mention
and
that
the
ring
must
be
returned
with
an
assurance
that
she
could
not
accept
it
with
propriety
and
at
the
same
time
she
forbade
theresa
to
repeat
any
future
message
from
valancourt
as
she
valued
her
esteem
and
kindness
theresa
was
afflicted
and
made
another
attempt
though
feeble
to
interest
her
for
valancourt
but
the
unusual
displeasure
expressed
in
emilyâ€™s
countenance
soon
obliged
her
to
desist
and
she
departed
in
wonder
and
lamentation
to
relieve
her
mind
in
some
degree
from
the
painful
recollections
that
intruded
upon
it
emily
busied
herself
in
preparations
for
the
journey
into
languedoc
and
while
annette
who
assisted
her
spoke
with
joy
and
affection
of
the
safe
return
of
ludovico
she
was
considering
how
she
might
best
promote
their
happiness
and
determined
if
it
appeared
that
his
affection
was
as
unchanged
as
that
of
the
simple
and
honest
annette
to
give
her
a
marriage
portion
and
settle
them
on
some
part
of
her
estate
these
considerations
led
her
to
the
remembrance
of
her
fatherâ€™s
paternal
domain
which
his
affairs
had
formerly
compelled
him
to
dispose
of
to
m
quesnel
and
which
she
frequently
wished
to
regain
because
st
aubert
had
lamented
that
the
chief
lands
of
his
ancestors
had
passed
into
another
family
and
because
they
had
been
his
birth-place
and
the
haunt
of
his
early
years
to
the
estate
at
thoulouse
she
had
no
peculiar
attachment
and
it
was
her
wish
to
dispose
of
this
that
she
might
purchase
her
paternal
domains
if
m
quesnel
could
be
prevailed
on
to
part
with
them
which
as
he
talked
much
of
living
in
italy
did
not
appear
very
improbable
sweet
is
the
breath
of
vernal
shower
the
beesâ€™
collected
treasures
sweet
sweet
musicâ€™s
melting
fall
but
sweeter
yet
the
still
small
voice
of
gratitude
gray
on
the
following
day
the
arrival
of
her
friend
revived
the
drooping
emily
and
la
vallã©e
became
once
more
the
scene
of
social
kindness
and
of
elegant
hospitality
illness
and
the
terror
she
had
suffered
had
stolen
from
blanche
much
of
her
sprightliness
but
all
her
affectionate
simplicity
remained
and
though
she
appeared
less
blooming
she
was
not
less
engaging
than
before
the
unfortunate
adventure
on
the
pyrenees
had
made
the
count
very
anxious
to
reach
home
and
after
little
more
than
a
weekâ€™s
stay
at
la
vallã©e
emily
prepared
to
set
out
with
her
friends
for
languedoc
assigning
the
care
of
her
house
during
her
absence
to
theresa
on
the
evening
preceding
her
departure
this
old
servant
brought
again
the
ring
of
valancourt
and
with
tears
entreated
her
mistress
to
receive
it
for
that
she
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
of
m
valancourt
since
the
night
when
he
delivered
it
to
her
as
she
said
this
her
countenance
expressed
more
alarm
than
she
dared
to
utter
but
emily
checking
her
own
propensity
to
fear
considered
that
he
had
probably
returned
to
the
residence
of
his
brother
and
again
refusing
to
accept
the
ring
bade
theresa
preserve
it
till
she
saw
him
which
with
extreme
reluctance
she
promised
to
do
on
the
following
day
count
de
villefort
with
emily
and
the
lady
blanche
left
la
vallã©e
and
on
the
ensuing
evening
arrived
at
the
chã¢teau-le-blanc
where
the
countess
henri
and
m
du
pont
whom
emily
was
surprised
to
find
there
received
them
with
much
joy
and
congratulation
she
was
concerned
to
observe
that
the
count
still
encouraged
the
hopes
of
his
friend
whose
countenance
declared
that
his
affection
had
suffered
no
abatement
from
absence
and
was
much
distressed
when
on
the
second
evening
after
her
arrival
the
count
having
withdrawn
her
from
the
lady
blanche
with
whom
she
was
walking
renewed
the
subject
of
m
du
pontâ€™s
hopes
the
mildness
with
which
she
listened
to
his
intercessions
at
first
deceiving
him
as
to
her
sentiments
he
began
to
believe
that
her
affection
for
valancourt
being
overcome
she
was
at
length
disposed
to
think
favourably
of
m
du
pont
and
when
she
afterwards
convinced
him
of
his
mistake
he
ventured
in
the
earnestness
of
his
wish
to
promote
what
he
considered
to
be
the
happiness
of
two
persons
whom
he
so
much
esteemed
gently
to
remonstrate
with
her
on
thus
suffering
an
ill-placed
affection
to
poison
the
happiness
of
her
most
valuable
years
observing
her
silence
and
the
deep
dejection
of
her
countenance
he
concluded
with
saying
â€œi
will
not
say
more
now
but
i
will
still
believe
my
dear
mademoiselle
st
aubert
that
you
will
not
always
reject
a
person
so
truly
estimable
as
my
friend
du
pontâ€
he
spared
her
the
pain
of
replying
by
leaving
her
and
she
strolled
on
somewhat
displeased
with
the
count
for
having
persevered
to
plead
for
a
suit
which
she
had
repeatedly
rejected
and
lost
amidst
the
melancholy
recollections
which
this
topic
had
revived
till
she
had
insensibly
reached
the
borders
of
the
woods
that
screened
the
monastery
of
st
clair
when
perceiving
how
far
she
had
wandered
she
determined
to
extend
her
walk
a
little
farther
and
to
enquire
about
the
abbess
and
some
of
her
friends
among
the
nuns
though
the
evening
was
now
drawing
to
a
close
she
accepted
the
invitation
of
the
friar
who
opened
the
gate
and
anxious
to
meet
some
of
her
old
acquaintances
proceeded
towards
the
convent
parlour
as
she
crossed
the
lawn
that
sloped
from
the
front
of
the
monastery
towards
the
sea
she
was
struck
with
the
picture
of
repose
exhibited
by
some
monks
sitting
in
the
cloisters
which
extended
under
the
brow
of
the
woods
that
crowned
this
eminence
where
as
they
meditated
at
this
twilight
hour
holy
subjects
they
sometimes
suffered
their
attention
to
be
relieved
by
the
scene
before
them
nor
thought
it
profane
to
look
at
nature
now
that
it
had
exchanged
the
brilliant
colours
of
day
for
the
sober
hue
of
evening
before
the
cloisters
however
spread
an
ancient
chesnut
whose
ample
branches
were
designed
to
screen
the
full
magnificence
of
a
scene
that
might
tempt
the
wish
to
worldly
pleasures
but
still
beneath
the
dark
and
spreading
foliage
gleamed
a
wide
extent
of
ocean
and
many
a
passing
sail
while
to
the
right
and
left
thick
woods
were
seen
stretching
along
the
winding
shores
so
much
as
this
had
been
admitted
perhaps
to
give
to
the
secluded
votary
an
image
of
the
dangers
and
vicissitudes
of
life
and
to
console
him
now
that
he
had
renounced
its
pleasures
by
the
certainty
of
having
escaped
its
evils
as
emily
walked
pensively
along
considering
how
much
suffering
she
might
have
escaped
had
she
become
a
votaress
of
the
order
and
remained
in
this
retirement
from
the
time
of
her
fatherâ€™s
death
the
vesper-bell
struck
up
and
the
monks
retired
slowly
toward
the
chapel
while
she
pursuing
her
way
entered
the
great
hall
where
an
unusual
silence
seemed
to
reign
the
parlour
too
which
opened
from
it
she
found
vacant
but
as
the
evening
bell
was
sounding
she
believed
the
nuns
had
withdrawn
into
the
chapel
and
sat
down
to
rest
for
a
moment
before
she
returned
to
the
chã¢teau
where
however
the
increasing
gloom
made
her
now
anxious
to
be
not
many
minutes
had
elapsed
before
a
nun
entering
in
haste
enquired
for
the
abbess
and
was
retiring
without
recollecting
emily
when
she
made
herself
known
and
then
learned
that
a
mass
was
going
to
be
performed
for
the
soul
of
sister
agnes
who
had
been
declining
for
some
time
and
who
was
now
believed
to
be
dying
of
her
sufferings
the
sister
gave
a
melancholy
account
and
of
the
horrors
into
which
she
had
frequently
started
but
which
had
now
yielded
to
a
dejection
so
gloomy
that
neither
the
prayers
in
which
she
was
joined
by
the
sisterhood
nor
the
assurances
of
her
confessor
had
power
to
recall
her
from
it
or
to
cheer
her
mind
even
with
a
momentary
gleam
of
comfort
to
this
relation
emily
listened
with
extreme
concern
and
recollecting
the
frenzied
manners
and
the
expressions
of
horror
which
she
had
herself
witnessed
of
agnes
together
with
the
history
that
sister
frances
had
communicated
her
compassion
was
heightened
to
a
very
painful
degree
as
the
evening
was
already
far
advanced
emily
did
not
now
desire
to
see
her
or
to
join
in
the
mass
and
after
leaving
many
kind
remembrances
with
the
nun
for
her
old
friends
she
quitted
the
monastery
and
returned
over
the
cliffs
towards
the
chã¢teau
meditating
upon
what
she
had
just
heard
till
at
length
she
forced
her
mind
upon
less
interesting
subjects
the
wind
was
high
and
as
she
drew
near
the
chã¢teau
she
often
paused
to
listen
to
its
awful
sound
as
it
swept
over
the
billows
that
beat
below
or
groaned
along
the
surrounding
woods
and
while
she
rested
on
a
cliff
at
a
short
distance
from
the
chã¢teau
and
looked
upon
the
wide
waters
seen
dimly
beneath
the
last
shade
of
twilight
she
thought
of
the
following
address
to
the
winds
viewless
through
heavenâ€™s
vast
vault
your
course
ye
steer
unknown
from
whence
ye
come
or
whither
go
mysterious
powâ€™rs
i
hear
ye
murmur
low
till
swells
your
loud
gust
on
my
startled
ear
and
awful
seems
to
sayâ€”some
god
is
near
i
love
to
list
your
midnight
voices
float
in
the
dread
storm
that
oâ€™er
the
ocean
rolls
and
while
their
charm
the
angry
wave
controls
mix
with
its
sullen
roar
and
sink
remote
then
rising
in
the
pause
a
sweeter
note
the
dirge
of
spirits
who
your
deeds
bewail
a
sweeter
note
oft
swells
while
sleeps
the
gale
but
soon
ye
sightless
powâ€™rs
your
rest
is
oâ€™er
solemn
and
slow
ye
rise
upon
the
air
speak
in
the
shrouds
and
bid
the
sea-boy
fear
and
the
faint-warbled
dirgeâ€”is
heard
no
more
oh
then
i
deprecate
your
awful
reign
the
loud
lament
yet
bear
not
on
your
breath
bear
not
the
crash
of
bark
far
on
the
main
bear
not
the
cry
of
men
who
cry
in
vain
the
crewâ€™s
dread
chorus
sinking
into
death
oh
give
not
these
ye
powâ€™rs
i
ask
alone
as
rapt
i
climb
these
dark
romantic
steeps
the
elemental
war
the
billowâ€™s
moan
i
ask
the
still
sweet
tear
that
listening
fancy
weeps
unnatural
deeds
do
breed
unnatural
troubles
infected
minds
to
their
deaf
pillows
will
discharge
their
secrets
more
needs
she
the
divine
than
the
physician
macbeth
on
the
following
evening
the
view
of
the
convent
towers
rising
among
the
shadowy
woods
reminded
emily
of
the
nun
whose
condition
had
so
much
affected
her
and
anxious
to
know
how
she
was
as
well
as
to
see
some
of
her
former
friends
she
and
the
lady
blanche
extended
their
walk
to
the
monastery
at
the
gate
stood
a
carriage
which
from
the
heat
of
the
horses
appeared
to
have
just
arrived
but
a
more
than
common
stillness
pervaded
the
court
and
the
cloisters
through
which
emily
and
blanche
passed
in
their
way
to
the
great
hall
where
a
nun
who
was
crossing
to
the
staircase
replied
to
the
enquiries
of
the
former
that
sister
agnes
was
still
living
and
sensible
but
that
it
was
thought
she
could
not
survive
the
night
in
the
parlour
they
found
several
of
the
boarders
who
rejoiced
to
see
emily
and
told
her
many
little
circumstances
that
had
happened
in
the
convent
since
her
departure
and
which
were
interesting
to
her
only
because
they
related
to
persons
whom
she
had
regarded
with
affection
while
they
thus
conversed
the
abbess
entered
the
room
and
expressed
much
satisfaction
at
seeing
emily
but
her
manner
was
unusually
solemn
and
her
countenance
dejected
â€œour
houseâ€
said
she
after
the
first
salutations
were
over
â€œis
truly
a
house
of
mourningâ€”a
daughter
is
now
paying
the
debt
of
natureâ€”you
have
heard
perhaps
that
our
daughter
agnes
is
dyingâ€
emily
expressed
her
sincere
concern
â€œher
death
presents
to
us
a
great
and
awful
lessonâ€
continued
the
abbess
â€œlet
us
read
it
and
profit
by
it
let
it
teach
us
to
prepare
ourselves
for
the
change
that
awaits
us
all
you
are
young
and
have
it
yet
in
your
power
to
secure
â€˜the
peace
that
passeth
all
understandingâ€™â€”the
peace
of
conscience
preserve
it
in
your
youth
that
it
may
comfort
you
in
age
for
vain
alas
and
imperfect
are
the
good
deeds
of
our
latter
years
if
those
of
our
early
life
have
been
evilâ€
emily
would
have
said
that
good
deeds
she
hoped
were
never
vain
but
she
considered
that
it
was
the
abbess
who
spoke
and
she
remained
silent
â€œthe
latter
days
of
agnesâ€
resumed
the
abbess
â€œhave
been
exemplary
would
they
might
atone
for
the
errors
of
her
former
ones
her
sufferings
now
alas
are
great
let
us
believe
that
they
will
make
her
peace
hereafter
i
have
left
her
with
her
confessor
and
a
gentleman
whom
she
has
long
been
anxious
to
see
and
who
is
just
arrived
from
paris
they
i
hope
will
be
able
to
administer
the
repose
which
her
mind
has
hitherto
wantedâ€
emily
fervently
joined
in
the
wish
â€œduring
her
illness
she
has
sometimes
named
youâ€
resumed
the
abbess
â€œperhaps
it
would
comfort
her
to
see
you
when
her
present
visitors
have
left
her
we
will
go
to
her
chamber
if
the
scene
will
not
be
too
melancholy
for
your
spirits
but
indeed
to
such
scenes
however
painful
we
ought
to
accustom
ourselves
for
they
are
salutary
to
the
soul
and
prepare
us
for
what
we
are
ourselves
to
sufferâ€
emily
became
grave
and
thoughtful
for
this
conversation
brought
to
her
recollection
the
dying
moments
of
her
beloved
father
and
she
wished
once
more
to
weep
over
the
spot
where
his
remains
were
buried
during
the
silence
which
followed
the
abbessâ€™
speech
many
minute
circumstances
attending
his
last
hours
occurred
to
herâ€”his
emotion
on
perceiving
himself
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
chã¢teau-le-blancâ€”his
request
to
be
interred
in
a
particular
spot
in
the
church
of
this
monasteryâ€”and
the
solemn
charge
he
had
delivered
to
her
to
destroy
certain
papers
without
examining
themâ€”she
recollected
also
the
mysterious
and
horrible
words
in
those
manuscripts
upon
which
her
eye
had
involuntarily
glanced
and
though
they
now
and
indeed
whenever
she
remembered
them
revived
an
excess
of
painful
curiosity
concerning
their
full
import
and
the
motives
for
her
fatherâ€™s
command
it
was
ever
her
chief
consolation
that
she
had
strictly
obeyed
him
in
this
particular
little
more
was
said
by
the
abbess
who
appeared
too
much
affected
by
the
subject
she
had
lately
left
to
be
willing
to
converse
and
her
companions
had
been
for
some
time
silent
from
the
same
cause
when
this
general
reverie
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
stranger
monsieur
bonnac
who
had
just
quitted
the
chamber
of
sister
agnes
he
appeared
much
disturbed
but
emily
fancied
that
his
countenance
had
more
the
expression
of
horror
than
of
grief
having
drawn
the
abbess
to
a
distant
part
of
the
room
he
conversed
with
her
for
some
time
during
which
she
seemed
to
listen
with
earnest
attention
and
he
to
speak
with
caution
and
a
more
than
common
degree
of
interest
when
he
had
concluded
he
bowed
silently
to
the
rest
of
the
company
and
quitted
the
room
the
abbess
soon
after
proposed
going
to
the
chamber
of
sister
agnes
to
which
emily
consented
though
not
without
some
reluctance
and
lady
blanche
remained
with
the
boarders
below
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
they
met
the
confessor
whom
as
he
lifted
up
his
head
on
their
approach
emily
observed
to
be
the
same
that
had
attended
her
dying
father
but
he
passed
on
without
noticing
her
and
they
entered
the
apartment
where
on
a
mattress
was
laid
sister
agnes
with
one
nun
watching
in
the
chair
beside
her
her
countenance
was
so
much
changed
that
emily
would
scarcely
have
recollected
her
had
she
not
been
prepared
to
do
so
it
was
ghastly
and
overspread
with
gloomy
horror
her
dim
and
hollow
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
crucifix
which
she
held
upon
her
bosom
and
she
was
so
much
engaged
in
thought
as
not
to
perceive
the
abbess
and
emily
till
they
stood
at
the
bedside
then
turning
her
heavy
eyes
she
fixed
them
in
wild
horror
upon
emily
and
screaming
exclaimed
â€œah
that
vision
comes
upon
me
in
my
dying
hoursâ€
emily
started
back
in
terror
and
looked
for
explanation
to
the
abbess
who
made
her
a
signal
not
to
be
alarmed
and
calmly
said
to
agnes
â€œdaughter
i
have
brought
mademoiselle
st
aubert
to
visit
you
i
thought
you
would
be
glad
to
see
herâ€
agnes
made
no
reply
but
still
gazing
wildly
upon
emily
exclaimed
â€œit
is
her
very
self
oh
there
is
all
that
fascination
in
her
look
which
proved
my
destruction
what
would
you
haveâ€”what
is
it
you
came
to
demandâ€”retributionâ€”it
will
soon
be
yoursâ€”it
is
yours
already
how
many
years
have
passed
since
last
i
saw
you
my
crime
is
but
as
yesterdayâ€”yet
i
am
grown
old
beneath
it
while
you
are
still
young
and
bloomingâ€”blooming
as
when
you
forced
me
to
commit
that
most
abhorred
deed
o
could
i
once
forget
itâ€”yet
what
would
that
availâ€”the
deed
is
doneâ€
emily
extremely
shocked
would
now
have
left
the
room
but
the
abbess
taking
her
hand
tried
to
support
her
spirits
and
begged
she
would
stay
a
few
moments
when
agnes
would
probably
be
calm
whom
now
she
tried
to
sooth
but
the
latter
seemed
to
disregard
her
while
she
still
fixed
her
eyes
on
emily
and
added
â€œwhat
are
years
of
prayers
and
repentance
they
cannot
wash
out
the
foulness
of
murderâ€”yes
murder
where
is
heâ€”where
is
heâ€”look
thereâ€”look
thereâ€”see
where
he
stalks
along
the
room
why
do
you
come
to
torment
me
nowâ€
continued
agnes
while
her
straining
eyes
were
bent
on
air
â€œwhy
was
not
i
punished
beforeâ€”o
do
not
frown
so
sternly
hah
there
again
â€™tis
she
herself
why
do
you
look
so
piteously
upon
meâ€”and
smile
too
smile
on
me
what
groan
was
thatâ€
agnes
sunk
down
apparently
lifeless
and
emily
unable
to
support
herself
leaned
against
the
bed
while
the
abbess
and
the
attendant
nun
were
applying
the
usual
remedies
to
agnes
â€œpeaceâ€
said
the
abbess
when
emily
was
going
to
speak
â€œthe
delirium
is
going
off
she
will
soon
revive
when
was
she
thus
before
daughterâ€
â€œnot
of
many
weeks
madamâ€
replied
the
nun
â€œbut
her
spirits
have
been
much
agitated
by
the
arrival
of
the
gentleman
she
wished
so
much
to
seeâ€
â€œyesâ€
observed
the
abbess
â€œthat
has
undoubtedly
occasioned
this
paroxysm
of
frenzy
when
she
is
better
we
will
leave
her
to
reposeâ€
emily
very
readily
consented
but
though
she
could
now
give
little
assistance
she
was
unwilling
to
quit
the
chamber
while
any
might
be
necessary
when
agnes
recovered
her
senses
she
again
fixed
her
eyes
on
emily
but
their
wild
expression
was
gone
and
a
gloomy
melancholy
had
succeeded
it
was
some
moments
before
she
recovered
sufficient
spirits
to
speak
she
then
said
feeblyâ€”â€œthe
likeness
is
wonderfulâ€”surely
it
must
be
something
more
than
fancy
tell
me
i
conjure
youâ€
she
added
addressing
emily
â€œthough
your
name
is
st
aubert
are
you
not
the
daughter
of
the
marchionessâ€
â€œwhat
marchionessâ€
said
emily
in
extreme
surprise
for
she
had
imagined
from
the
calmness
of
agnesâ€™s
manner
that
her
intellects
were
restored
the
abbess
gave
her
a
significant
glance
but
she
repeated
the
question
â€œwhat
marchionessâ€
exclaimed
agnes
â€œi
know
but
of
oneâ€”the
marchioness
de
villeroiâ€
emily
remembering
the
emotion
of
her
late
father
upon
the
unexpected
mention
of
this
lady
and
his
request
to
be
laid
near
to
the
tomb
of
the
villerois
now
felt
greatly
interested
and
she
entreated
agnes
to
explain
the
reason
of
her
question
the
abbess
would
now
have
withdrawn
emily
from
the
room
who
being
however
detained
by
a
strong
interest
repeated
her
entreaties
â€œbring
me
that
casket
sisterâ€
said
agnes
â€œi
will
show
her
to
you
yet
you
need
only
look
in
that
mirror
and
you
will
behold
her
you
surely
are
her
daughter
such
striking
resemblance
is
never
found
but
among
near
relationsâ€
the
nun
brought
the
casket
and
agnes
having
directed
her
how
to
unlock
it
she
took
thence
a
miniature
in
which
emily
perceived
the
exact
resemblance
of
the
picture
which
she
had
found
among
her
late
fatherâ€™s
papers
agnes
held
out
her
hand
to
receive
it
gazed
upon
it
earnestly
for
some
moments
in
silence
and
then
with
a
countenance
of
deep
despair
threw
up
her
eyes
to
heaven
and
prayed
inwardly
when
she
had
finished
she
returned
the
miniature
to
emily
â€œkeep
itâ€
said
she
â€œi
bequeath
it
to
you
for
i
must
believe
it
is
your
right
i
have
frequently
observed
the
resemblance
between
you
but
never
till
this
day
did
it
strike
upon
my
conscience
so
powerfully
stay
sister
do
not
remove
the
casketâ€”there
is
another
picture
i
would
showâ€
emily
trembled
with
expectation
and
the
abbess
again
would
have
withdrawn
her
â€œagnes
is
still
disorderedâ€
said
she
â€œyou
observe
how
she
wanders
in
these
moods
she
says
anything
and
does
not
scruple
as
you
have
witnessed
to
accuse
herself
of
the
most
horrible
crimesâ€
emily
however
thought
she
perceived
something
more
than
madness
in
the
inconsistencies
of
agnes
whose
mention
of
the
marchioness
and
production
of
her
picture
had
interested
her
so
much
that
she
determined
to
obtain
further
information
if
possible
respecting
the
subject
of
it
the
nun
returned
with
the
casket
and
agnes
pointing
out
to
her
a
secret
drawer
she
took
from
it
another
miniature
â€œhereâ€
said
agnes
as
she
offered
it
to
emily
â€œlearn
a
lesson
for
your
vanity
at
least
look
well
at
this
picture
and
see
if
you
can
discover
any
resemblance
between
what
i
was
and
what
i
amâ€
emily
impatiently
received
the
miniature
which
her
eyes
had
scarcely
glanced
upon
before
her
trembling
hands
had
nearly
suffered
it
to
fallâ€”it
was
the
resemblance
of
the
portrait
of
signora
laurentini
which
she
had
formerly
seen
in
the
castle
of
udolphoâ€”the
lady
who
had
disappeared
in
so
mysterious
a
manner
and
whom
montoni
had
been
suspected
of
having
caused
to
be
murdered
in
silent
astonishment
emily
continued
to
gaze
alternately
upon
the
picture
and
the
dying
nun
endeavouring
to
trace
a
resemblance
between
them
which
no
longer
existed
â€œwhy
do
you
look
so
sternly
on
meâ€
said
agnes
mistaking
the
nature
of
emilyâ€™s
emotion
â€œi
have
seen
this
face
beforeâ€
said
emily
at
length
â€œwas
it
really
your
resemblanceâ€
â€œyou
may
well
ask
that
questionâ€
replied
the
nunâ€”â€œbut
it
was
once
esteemed
a
striking
likeness
of
me
look
at
me
well
and
see
what
guilt
has
made
me
i
then
was
innocent
the
evil
passions
of
my
nature
slept
sisterâ€
added
she
solemnly
and
stretching
forth
her
cold
damp
hand
to
emily
who
shuddered
at
its
touchâ€”â€œsister
beware
of
the
first
indulgence
of
the
passions
beware
of
the
first
their
course
if
not
checked
then
is
rapidâ€”their
force
is
uncontrollableâ€”they
lead
us
we
know
not
whitherâ€”they
lead
us
perhaps
to
the
commission
of
crimes
for
which
whole
years
of
prayer
and
penitence
cannot
atoneâ€”such
may
be
the
force
of
even
a
single
passion
that
it
overcomes
every
other
and
sears
up
every
other
approach
to
the
heart
possessing
us
like
a
fiend
it
leads
us
on
to
the
acts
of
a
fiend
making
us
insensible
to
pity
and
to
conscience
and
when
its
purpose
is
accomplished
like
a
fiend
it
leaves
us
to
the
torture
of
those
feelings
which
its
power
had
suspendedâ€”not
annihilatedâ€”to
the
tortures
of
compassion
remorse
and
conscience
then
we
awaken
as
from
a
dream
and
perceive
a
new
world
around
usâ€”we
gaze
in
astonishment
and
horrorâ€”but
the
deed
is
committed
not
all
the
powers
of
heaven
and
earth
united
can
undo
itâ€”and
the
spectres
of
conscience
will
not
fly
what
are
richesâ€”grandeurâ€”health
itself
to
the
luxury
of
a
pure
conscience
the
health
of
the
soulâ€”and
what
the
sufferings
of
poverty
disappointment
despairâ€”to
the
anguish
of
an
afflicted
one
o
how
long
is
it
since
i
knew
that
luxury
i
believed
that
i
had
suffered
the
most
agonizing
pangs
of
human
nature
in
love
jealousy
and
despairâ€”but
these
pangs
were
ease
compared
with
the
stings
of
conscience
which
i
have
since
endured
i
tasted
too
what
was
called
the
sweet
of
revengeâ€”but
it
was
transient
it
expired
even
with
the
object
that
provoked
it
remember
sister
that
the
passions
are
the
seeds
of
vices
as
well
as
of
virtues
from
which
either
may
spring
accordingly
as
they
are
nurtured
unhappy
they
who
have
never
been
taught
the
art
to
govern
themâ€
â€œalas
unhappyâ€
said
the
abbess
â€œand
ill-informed
of
our
holy
religionâ€
emily
listened
to
agnes
in
silent
awe
while
she
still
examined
the
miniature
and
became
confirmed
in
her
opinion
of
its
strong
resemblance
to
the
portrait
at
udolpho
â€œthis
face
is
familiar
to
meâ€
said
she
wishing
to
lead
the
nun
to
an
explanation
yet
fearing
to
discover
too
abruptly
her
knowledge
of
udolpho
â€œyou
are
mistakenâ€
replied
agnes
â€œyou
certainly
never
saw
that
picture
beforeâ€
â€œnoâ€
replied
emily
â€œbut
i
have
seen
one
extremely
like
itâ€
â€œimpossibleâ€
said
agnes
who
may
now
be
called
the
lady
laurentini
â€œit
was
in
the
castle
of
udolphoâ€
continued
emily
looking
steadfastly
at
her
â€œof
udolphoâ€
exclaimed
laurentini
â€œof
udolpho
in
italyâ€
â€œthe
sameâ€
replied
emily
â€œyou
know
me
thenâ€
said
laurentini
â€œand
you
are
the
daughter
of
the
marchionessâ€
emily
was
somewhat
surprised
at
this
abrupt
assertion
â€œi
am
the
daughter
of
the
late
mons
st
aubertâ€
said
she
â€œand
the
lady
you
name
is
an
utter
stranger
to
meâ€
â€œat
least
you
believe
soâ€
rejoined
laurentini
emily
asked
what
reasons
there
could
be
to
believe
otherwise
â€œthe
family
likeness
that
you
bear
herâ€
said
the
nun
â€œthe
marchioness
it
is
known
was
attached
to
a
gentleman
of
gascony
at
the
time
when
she
accepted
the
hand
of
the
marquis
by
the
command
of
her
father
ill-fated
unhappy
womanâ€
emily
remembering
the
extreme
emotion
which
st
aubert
had
betrayed
on
the
mention
of
the
marchioness
would
now
have
suffered
something
more
than
surprise
had
her
confidence
in
his
integrity
been
less
as
it
was
she
could
not
for
a
moment
believe
what
the
words
of
laurentini
insinuated
yet
she
still
felt
strongly
interested
concerning
them
and
begged
that
she
would
explain
them
further
â€œdo
not
urge
me
on
that
subjectâ€
said
the
nun
â€œit
is
to
me
a
terrible
one
would
that
i
could
blot
it
from
my
memoryâ€
she
sighed
deeply
and
after
the
pause
of
a
moment
asked
emily
by
what
means
she
had
discovered
her
name
â€œby
your
portrait
in
the
castle
of
udolpho
to
which
this
miniature
bears
a
striking
resemblanceâ€
replied
emily
â€œyou
have
been
at
udolpho
thenâ€
said
the
nun
with
great
emotion
â€œalas
what
scenes
does
the
mention
of
it
revive
in
my
fancyâ€”scenes
of
happinessâ€”of
sufferingâ€”and
of
horrorâ€
at
this
moment
the
terrible
spectacle
which
emily
had
witnessed
in
a
chamber
of
that
castle
occurred
to
her
and
she
shuddered
while
she
looked
upon
the
nunâ€”and
recollected
her
late
wordsâ€”that
â€œyears
of
prayer
and
penitence
could
not
wash
out
the
foulness
of
murderâ€
she
was
now
compelled
to
attribute
these
to
another
cause
than
that
of
delirium
with
a
degree
of
horror
that
almost
deprived
her
of
sense
she
now
believed
she
looked
upon
a
murderer
all
the
recollected
behaviour
of
laurentini
seemed
to
confirm
the
supposition
yet
emily
was
still
lost
in
a
labyrinth
of
perplexities
and
not
knowing
how
to
ask
the
questions
which
might
lead
to
truth
she
could
only
hint
them
in
broken
sentences
â€œyour
sudden
departure
from
udolphoâ€â€”said
she
laurentini
groaned
â€œthe
reports
that
followed
itâ€
continued
emilyâ€”â€œthe
west
chamberâ€”the
mournful
veilâ€”the
object
it
concealsâ€”when
murders
are
committedâ€”â€
the
nun
shrieked
â€œwhat
there
againâ€
said
she
endeavouring
to
raise
herself
while
her
starting
eyes
seemed
to
follow
some
object
round
the
roomâ€”â€œcome
from
the
grave
what
bloodâ€”blood
tooâ€”there
was
no
bloodâ€”thou
canst
not
say
itâ€”nay
do
not
smileâ€”do
not
smile
so
piteouslyâ€
laurentini
fell
into
convulsions
as
she
uttered
the
last
words
and
emily
unable
any
longer
to
endure
the
horror
of
the
scene
hurried
from
the
room
and
sent
some
nuns
to
the
assistance
of
the
abbess
the
lady
blanche
and
the
boarders
who
were
in
the
parlour
now
assembled
round
emily
and
alarmed
by
her
manner
and
affrighted
countenance
asked
a
hundred
questions
which
she
avoided
answering
further
than
by
saying
that
she
believed
sister
agnes
was
dying
they
received
this
as
a
sufficient
explanation
of
her
terror
and
had
then
leisure
to
offer
restoratives
which
at
length
somewhat
revived
emily
whose
mind
was
however
so
much
shocked
with
the
terrible
surmises
and
perplexed
with
doubts
by
some
words
from
the
nun
that
she
was
unable
to
converse
and
would
have
left
the
convent
immediately
had
she
not
wished
to
know
whether
laurentini
would
survive
the
late
attack
after
waiting
some
time
she
was
informed
that
the
convulsions
having
ceased
laurentini
seemed
to
be
reviving
and
emily
and
blanche
were
departing
when
the
abbess
appeared
who
drawing
the
former
aside
said
she
had
something
of
consequence
to
say
to
her
but
as
it
was
late
she
would
not
detain
her
then
and
requested
to
see
her
on
the
following
day
emily
promised
to
visit
her
and
having
taken
leave
returned
with
the
lady
blanche
towards
the
chã¢teau
on
the
way
to
which
the
deep
gloom
of
the
woods
made
blanche
lament
that
the
evening
was
so
far
advanced
for
the
surrounding
stillness
and
obscurity
rendered
her
sensible
of
fear
though
there
was
a
servant
to
protect
her
while
emily
was
too
much
engaged
by
the
horrors
of
the
scene
she
had
just
witnessed
to
be
affected
by
the
solemnity
of
the
shades
otherwise
than
as
they
served
to
promote
her
gloomy
reverie
from
which
however
she
was
at
length
recalled
by
the
lady
blanche
who
pointed
out
at
some
distance
in
the
dusky
path
they
were
winding
two
persons
slowly
advancing
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
them
without
striking
into
a
still
more
secluded
part
of
the
wood
whither
the
strangers
might
easily
follow
but
all
apprehension
vanished
when
emily
distinguished
the
voice
of
mons
du
pont
and
perceived
that
his
companion
was
the
gentleman
whom
she
had
seen
at
the
monastery
and
who
was
now
conversing
with
so
much
earnestness
as
not
immediately
to
perceive
their
approach
when
du
pont
joined
the
ladies
the
stranger
took
leave
and
they
proceeded
to
the
chã¢teau
where
the
count
when
he
heard
of
mons
bonnac
claimed
him
for
an
acquaintance
and
on
learning
the
melancholy
occasion
of
his
visit
to
languedoc
and
that
he
was
lodged
at
a
small
inn
in
the
village
begged
the
favour
of
mons
du
pont
to
invite
him
to
the
chã¢teau
the
latter
was
happy
to
do
so
and
the
scruples
of
reserve
which
made
m
bonnac
hesitate
to
accept
the
invitation
being
at
length
overcome
they
went
to
the
chã¢teau
where
the
kindness
of
the
count
and
the
sprightliness
of
his
son
were
exerted
to
dissipate
the
gloom
that
overhung
the
spirits
of
the
stranger
m
bonnac
was
an
officer
in
the
french
service
and
appeared
to
be
about
fifty
his
figure
was
tall
and
commanding
his
manners
had
received
the
last
polish
and
there
was
something
in
his
countenance
uncommonly
interesting
for
over
features
which
in
youth
must
have
been
remarkably
handsome
was
spread
a
melancholy
that
seemed
the
effect
of
long
misfortune
rather
than
of
constitution
or
temper
the
conversation
he
held
during
supper
was
evidently
an
effort
of
politeness
and
there
were
intervals
in
which
unable
to
struggle
against
the
feelings
that
depressed
him
he
relapsed
into
silence
and
abstraction
from
which
however
the
count
sometimes
withdrew
him
in
a
manner
so
delicate
and
benevolent
that
emily
while
she
observed
him
almost
fancied
she
beheld
her
late
father
the
party
separated
at
an
early
hour
and
then
in
the
solitude
of
her
apartment
the
scenes
which
emily
had
lately
witnessed
returned
to
her
fancy
with
dreadful
energy
that
in
the
dying
nun
she
should
have
discovered
signora
laurentini
who
instead
of
having
been
murdered
by
montoni
was
as
it
now
seemed
herself
guilty
of
some
dreadful
crime
excited
both
horror
and
surprise
in
a
high
degree
nor
did
the
hints
which
she
had
dropped
respecting
the
marriage
of
the
marchioness
de
villeroi
and
the
enquiries
she
had
made
concerning
emilyâ€™s
birth
occasion
her
a
less
degree
of
interest
though
it
was
of
a
different
nature
the
history
which
sister
frances
had
formerly
related
and
had
said
to
be
that
of
agnes
it
now
appeared
was
erroneous
but
for
what
purpose
it
had
been
fabricated
unless
the
more
effectually
to
conceal
the
true
story
emily
could
not
even
guess
above
all
her
interest
was
excited
as
to
the
relation
which
the
story
of
the
late
marchioness
de
villeroi
bore
to
that
of
her
father
for
that
some
kind
of
relation
existed
between
them
the
grief
of
st
aubert
upon
hearing
her
named
his
request
to
be
buried
near
her
and
her
picture
which
had
been
found
among
his
papers
certainly
proved
sometimes
it
occurred
to
emily
that
he
might
have
been
the
lover
to
whom
it
was
said
the
marchioness
was
attached
when
she
was
compelled
to
marry
the
marquis
de
villeroi
but
that
he
had
afterwards
cherished
a
passion
for
her
she
could
not
suffer
herself
to
believe
for
a
moment
the
papers
which
he
had
so
solemnly
enjoined
her
to
destroy
she
now
fancied
had
related
to
this
connection
and
she
wished
more
earnestly
than
before
to
know
the
reasons
that
made
him
consider
the
injunction
necessary
which
had
her
faith
in
his
principles
been
less
would
have
led
to
believe
that
there
was
a
mystery
in
her
birth
dishonourable
to
her
parents
which
those
manuscripts
might
have
revealed
reflections
similar
to
these
engaged
her
mind
during
the
greater
part
of
the
night
and
when
at
length
she
fell
into
a
slumber
it
was
only
to
behold
a
vision
of
the
dying
nun
and
to
awaken
in
horrors
like
those
she
had
witnessed
on
the
following
morning
she
was
too
much
indisposed
to
attend
her
appointment
with
the
abbess
and
before
the
day
concluded
she
heard
that
sister
agnes
was
no
more
mons
bonnac
received
this
intelligence
with
concern
but
emily
observed
that
he
did
not
appear
so
much
affected
now
as
on
the
preceding
evening
immediately
after
quitting
the
apartment
of
the
nun
whose
death
was
probably
less
terrible
to
him
than
the
confession
he
had
been
then
called
upon
to
witness
however
this
might
be
he
was
perhaps
consoled
in
some
degree
by
a
knowledge
of
the
legacy
bequeathed
him
since
his
family
was
large
and
the
extravagance
of
some
part
of
it
had
lately
been
the
means
of
involving
him
in
great
distress
and
even
in
the
horrors
of
a
prison
and
it
was
the
grief
he
had
suffered
from
the
wild
career
of
a
favourite
son
with
the
pecuniary
anxieties
and
misfortunes
consequent
upon
it
that
had
given
to
his
countenance
the
air
of
dejection
which
had
so
much
interested
emily
to
his
friend
mons
du
pont
he
recited
some
particulars
of
his
late
sufferings
when
it
appeared
that
he
had
been
confined
for
several
months
in
one
of
the
prisons
of
paris
with
little
hope
of
release
and
without
the
comfort
of
seeing
his
wife
who
had
been
absent
in
the
country
endeavouring
though
in
vain
to
procure
assistance
from
his
friends
when
at
length
she
had
obtained
an
order
for
admittance
she
was
so
much
shocked
at
the
change
which
long
confinement
and
sorrow
had
made
in
his
appearance
that
she
was
seized
with
fits
which
by
their
long
continuance
threatened
her
life
â€œour
situation
affected
those
who
happened
to
witness
itâ€
continued
mons
bonnac
â€œand
one
generous
friend
who
was
in
confinement
at
the
same
time
afterwards
employed
the
first
moments
of
his
liberty
in
efforts
to
obtain
mine
he
succeeded
the
heavy
debt
that
oppressed
me
was
discharged
and
when
i
would
have
expressed
my
sense
of
the
obligation
i
had
received
my
benefactor
was
fled
from
my
search
i
have
reason
to
believe
he
was
the
victim
of
his
own
generosity
and
that
he
returned
to
the
state
of
confinement
from
which
he
had
released
me
but
every
enquiry
after
him
was

the
emotion
of
mons
du
pont
when
he
discovered
the
generous
benefactor
of
his
friend
to
be
the
rival
of
his
love
can
only
be
imagined
but
having
overcome
his
first
surprise
he
dissipated
the
apprehensions
of
mons
bonnac
by
acquainting
him
that
valancourt
was
at
liberty
and
had
lately
been
in
languedoc
after
which
his
affection
for
emily
prompted
him
to
make
some
enquiries
respecting
the
conduct
of
his
rival
during
his
stay
at
paris
of
which
m
bonnac
appeared
to
be
well
informed
the
answers
he
received
were
such
as
convinced
him
that
valancourt
had
been
much
misrepresented
and
painful
as
was
the
sacrifice
he
formed
the
just
design
of
relinquishing
his
pursuit
of
emily
to
a
lover
who
it
now
appeared
was
not
unworthy
of
the
regard
with
which
she
honoured
him
the
conversation
of
mons
bonnac
discovered
that
valancourt
some
time
after
his
arrival
at
paris
had
been
drawn
into
the
snares
which
determined
vice
had
spread
for
him
and
that
his
hours
had
been
chiefly
divided
between
the
parties
of
the
captivating
marchioness
and
those
gaming
assemblies
to
which
the
envy
or
the
avarice
of
his
brother
officers
had
spared
no
art
to
seduce
him
in
these
parties
he
had
lost
large
sums
in
efforts
to
recover
small
ones
and
to
such
losses
the
count
de
villefort
and
mons
henri
had
been
frequent
witnesses
his
resources
were
at
length
exhausted
and
the
count
his
brother
exasperated
by
his
conduct
refused
to
continue
the
supplies
necessary
to
his
present
mode
of
life
when
valancourt
in
consequence
of
accumulated
debts
was
thrown
into
confinement
where
his
brother
suffered
him
to
remain
in
the
hope
that
punishment
might
effect
a
reform
of
conduct
which
had
not
yet
been
confirmed
by
long
habit
in
the
solitude
of
his
prison
valancourt
had
leisure
for
reflection
and
cause
for
repentance
here
too
the
image
of
emily
which
amidst
the
dissipation
of
the
city
had
been
obscured
but
never
obliterated
from
his
heart
revived
with
all
the
charms
of
innocence
and
beauty
to
reproach
him
for
having
sacrificed
his
happiness
and
debased
his
talents
by
pursuits
which
his
nobler
faculties
would
formerly
have
taught
him
to
consider
were
as
tasteless
as
they
were
degrading
but
though
his
passions
had
been
seduced
his
heart
was
not
depraved
nor
had
habit
riveted
the
chains
that
hung
heavily
on
his
conscience
and
as
he
retained
that
energy
of
will
which
was
necessary
to
burst
them
he
at
length
emancipated
himself
from
the
bondage
of
vice
but
not
till
after
much
effort
and
severe
suffering
being
released
by
his
brother
from
the
prison
where
he
had
witnessed
the
affecting
meeting
between
mons
bonnac
and
his
wife
with
whom
he
had
been
for
some
time
acquainted
the
first
use
of
his
liberty
formed
a
striking
instance
of
his
humanity
and
his
rashness
for
with
nearly
all
the
money
just
received
from
his
brother
he
went
to
a
gaming-house
and
gave
it
as
a
last
stake
for
the
chance
of
restoring
his
friend
to
freedom
and
to
his
afflicted
family
the
event
was
fortunate
and
while
he
had
awaited
the
issue
of
this
momentous
stake
he
made
a
solemn
vow
never
again
to
yield
to
the
destructive
and
fascinating
vice
of
gaming
having
restored
the
venerable
mons
bonnac
to
his
rejoicing
family
he
hurried
from
paris
to
estuviã¨re
and
in
the
delight
of
having
made
the
wretched
happy
forgot
for
a
while
his
own
misfortunes
soon
however
he
remembered
that
he
had
thrown
away
the
fortune
without
which
he
could
never
hope
to
marry
emily
and
life
unless
passed
with
her
now
scarcely
appeared
supportable
for
her
goodness
refinement
and
simplicity
of
heart
rendered
her
beauty
more
enchanting
if
possible
to
his
fancy
than
it
had
ever
yet
appeared
experience
had
taught
him
to
understand
the
full
value
of
the
qualities
which
he
had
before
admired
but
which
the
contrasted
characters
he
had
seen
in
the
world
made
him
now
adore
and
these
reflections
increasing
the
pangs
of
remorse
and
regret
occasioned
the
deep
dejection
that
had
accompanied
him
even
into
the
presence
of
emily
of
whom
he
considered
himself
no
longer
worthy
to
the
ignominy
of
having
received
pecuniary
obligations
from
the
marchioness
chamfort
or
any
other
lady
of
intrigue
as
the
count
de
villefort
had
been
informed
or
of
having
been
engaged
in
the
depredating
schemes
of
gamesters
valancourt
had
never
submitted
and
these
were
some
of
such
scandals
as
often
mingle
with
truth
against
the
unfortunate
count
de
villefort
had
received
them
from
authority
which
he
had
no
reason
to
doubt
and
which
the
imprudent
conduct
he
had
himself
witnessed
in
valancourt
had
certainly
induced
him
the
more
readily
to
believe
being
such
as
emily
could
not
name
to
the
chevalier
he
had
no
opportunity
of
refuting
them
and
when
he
confessed
himself
to
be
unworthy
of
her
esteem
he
little
suspected
that
he
was
confirming
to
her
the
most
dreadful
calumnies
thus
the
mistake
had
been
mutual
and
had
remained
so
when
mons
bonnac
explained
the
conduct
of
his
generous
but
imprudent
young
friend
to
du
pont
who
with
severe
justice
determined
not
only
to
undeceive
the
count
on
this
subject
but
to
resign
all
hope
of
emily
such
a
sacrifice
as
his
love
rendered
this
was
deserving
of
a
noble
reward
and
mons
bonnac
if
it
had
been
possible
for
him
to
forget
the
benevolent
valancourt
would
have
wished
that
emily
might
accept
the
just
du
pont
when
the
count
was
informed
of
the
error
he
had
committed
he
was
extremely
shocked
at
the
consequence
of
his
credulity
and
the
account
which
mons
bonnac
gave
of
his
friendâ€™s
situation
while
at
paris
convinced
him
that
valancourt
had
been
entrapped
by
the
schemes
of
a
set
of
dissipated
young
men
with
whom
his
profession
had
partly
obliged
him
to
associate
rather
than
by
an
inclination
to
vice
and
charmed
by
the
humanity
and
noble
though
rash
generosity
which
his
conduct
towards
mons
bonnac
exhibited
he
forgave
him
the
transient
errors
that
had
stained
his
youth
and
restored
him
to
the
high
degree
of
esteem
with
which
he
had
regarded
him
during
their
early
acquaintance
but
as
the
least
reparation
he
could
now
make
valancourt
was
to
afford
him
an
opportunity
of
explaining
to
emily
his
former
conduct
he
immediately
wrote
to
request
his
forgiveness
of
the
unintentional
injury
he
had
done
him
and
to
invite
him
to
chã¢teau-le-blanc
motives
of
delicacy
withheld
the
count
from
informing
emily
of
this
letter
and
of
kindness
from
acquainting
her
with
the
discovery
respecting
valancourt
till
his
arrival
should
save
her
from
the
possibility
of
anxiety
as
to
its
event
and
this
precaution
spared
her
even
severer
inquietude
than
the
count
had
foreseen
since
he
was
ignorant
of
the
symptoms
of
despair
which
valancourtâ€™s
late
conduct
had
betrayed
but
in
these
cases
we
still
have
judgment
here
that
we
but
teach
bloody
instructions
which
being
taught
return
to
plague
the
inventor
thus
even-handed
justice
commends
the
ingredients
of
our
poisonâ€™d
chalice
to
our
own
lips
macbeth
some
circumstances
of
an
extraordinary
nature
now
withdrew
emily
from
her
own
sorrows
and
excited
emotions
which
partook
of
both
surprise
and
horror
a
few
days
followed
that
on
which
signora
laurentini
died
her
will
was
opened
at
the
monastery
in
the
presence
of
the
superiors
and
mons
bonnac
when
it
was
found
that
one
third
of
her
personal
property
was
bequeathed
to
the
nearest
surviving
relative
of
the
late
marchioness
de
villeroi
and
that
emily
was
the
person
with
the
secret
of
emilyâ€™s
family
the
abbess
had
long
been
acquainted
and
it
was
in
observance
of
the
earnest
request
of
st
aubert
who
was
known
to
the
friar
that
attended
him
on
his
death-bed
that
his
daughter
had
remained
in
ignorance
of
her
relationship
to
the
marchioness
but
some
hints
which
had
fallen
from
signora
laurentini
during
her
last
interview
with
emily
and
a
confession
of
a
very
extraordinary
nature
given
in
her
dying
hours
had
made
the
abbess
think
it
necessary
to
converse
with
her
young
friend
on
the
topic
she
had
not
before
ventured
to
introduce
and
it
was
for
this
purpose
that
she
had
requested
to
see
her
on
the
morning
that
followed
her
interview
with
the
nun
emilyâ€™s
indisposition
had
then
prevented
the
intended
conversation
but
now
after
the
will
had
been
examined
she
received
a
summons
which
she
immediately
obeyed
and
became
informed
of
circumstances
that
powerfully
affected
her
as
the
narrative
of
the
abbess
was
however
deficient
in
many
particulars
of
which
the
reader
may
wish
to
be
informed
and
the
history
of
the
nun
is
materially
connected
with
the
fate
of
the
marchioness
de
villeroi
we
shall
omit
the
conversation
that
passed
in
the
parlour
of
the
convent
and
mingle
with
our
relation
a
brief
history
of
laurentini
di
udolpho
who
was
the
only
child
of
her
parents
and
heiress
of
the
ancient
house
of
udolpho
in
the
territory
of
venice
it
was
the
first
misfortune
of
her
life
and
that
which
led
to
all
her
succeeding
misery
that
the
friends
who
ought
to
have
restrained
her
strong
passions
and
mildly
instructed
her
in
the
art
of
governing
them
nurtured
them
by
early
indulgence
but
they
cherished
their
own
failings
in
her
for
their
conduct
was
not
the
result
of
rational
kindness
and
when
they
either
indulged
or
opposed
the
passions
of
their
child
they
gratified
their
own
thus
they
indulged
her
with
weakness
and
reprehended
her
with
violence
her
spirit
was
exasperated
by
their
vehemence
instead
of
being
corrected
by
their
wisdom
and
their
oppositions
became
contest
for
victory
in
which
the
due
tenderness
of
the
parents
and
the
affectionate
duties
of
the
child
were
equally
forgotten
but
as
returning
fondness
disarmed
the
parentsâ€™
resentment
soonest
laurentini
was
suffered
to
believe
that
she
had
conquered
and
her
passions
became
stronger
by
every
effort
that
had
been
employed
to
subdue
them
the
death
of
her
father
and
mother
in
the
same
year
left
her
to
her
own
discretion
under
the
dangerous
circumstances
attendant
on
youth
and
beauty
she
was
fond
of
company
delighted
with
admiration
yet
disdainful
of
the
opinion
of
the
world
when
it
happened
to
contradict
her
inclinations
had
a
gay
and
brilliant
wit
and
was
mistress
of
all
the
arts
of
fascination
her
conduct
was
such
as
might
have
been
expected
from
the
weakness
of
her
principles
and
the
strength
of
her
passions
among
her
numerous
admirers
was
the
late
marquis
de
villeroi
who
on
his
tour
through
italy
saw
laurentini
at
venice
where
she
usually
resided
and
became
her
passionate
adorer
equally
captivated
by
the
figure
and
accomplishments
of
the
marquis
who
was
at
that
period
one
of
the
most
distinguished
noblemen
of
the
french
court
she
had
the
art
so
effectually
to
conceal
from
him
the
dangerous
traits
of
her
character
and
the
blemishes
of
her
late
conduct
that
he
solicited
her
hand
in
marriage
before
the
nuptials
were
concluded
she
retired
to
the
castle
of
udolpho
whither
the
marquis
followed
and
where
her
conduct
relaxing
from
the
propriety
which
she
had
lately
assumed
discovered
to
him
the
precipice
on
which
he
stood
a
minuter
enquiry
than
he
had
before
thought
it
necessary
to
make
convinced
him
that
he
had
been
deceived
in
her
character
and
she
whom
he
had
designed
for
his
wife
afterwards
became
his
mistress
having
passed
some
weeks
at
udolpho
he
was
called
abruptly
to
france
whither
he
returned
with
extreme
reluctance
for
his
heart
was
still
fascinated
by
the
arts
of
laurentini
with
whom
however
he
had
on
various
pretences
delayed
his
marriage
but
to
reconcile
her
to
this
separation
he
now
gave
repeated
promises
of
returning
to
conclude
the
nuptials
as
soon
as
the
affair
which
thus
suddenly
called
him
to
france
should
permit
soothed
in
some
degree
by
these
assurances
she
suffered
him
to
depart
and
soon
after
her
relative
montoni
arriving
at
udolpho
renewed
the
addresses
which
she
had
before
refused
and
which
she
now
again
rejected
meanwhile
her
thoughts
were
constantly
with
the
marquis
de
villeroi
for
whom
she
suffered
all
the
delirium
of
italian
love
cherished
by
the
solitude
to
which
she
confined
herself
for
she
had
now
lost
all
taste
for
the
pleasures
of
society
and
the
gaiety
of
amusement
her
only
indulgences
were
to
sigh
and
weep
over
a
miniature
of
the
marquis
to
visit
the
scenes
that
had
witnessed
their
happiness
to
pour
forth
her
heart
to
him
in
writing
and
to
count
the
weeks
the
days
which
must
intervene
before
the
period
that
he
had
mentioned
as
probable
for
his
return
but
this
period
passed
without
bringing
him
and
week
after
week
followed
in
heavy
and
almost
intolerable
expectation
during
this
interval
laurentiniâ€™s
fancy
occupied
incessantly
by
one
idea
became
disordered
and
her
whole
heart
being
devoted
to
one
object
life
became
hateful
to
her
when
she
believed
that
object
lost
several
months
passed
during
which
she
heard
nothing
from
the
marquis
de
villeroi
and
her
days
were
marked
at
intervals
with
the
frenzy
of
passion
and
the
sullenness
of
despair
she
secluded
herself
from
all
visitors
and
sometimes
remained
in
her
apartment
for
weeks
together
refusing
to
speak
to
every
person
except
her
favourite
female
attendant
writing
scraps
of
letters
reading
again
and
again
those
she
had
received
from
the
marquis
weeping
over
his
picture
and
speaking
to
it
for
many
hours
upbraiding
reproaching
and
caressing
it
alternately
at
length
a
report
reached
her
that
the
marquis
had
married
in
france
and
after
suffering
all
the
extremes
of
love
jealousy
and
indignation
she
formed
the
desperate
resolution
of
going
secretly
to
that
country
and
if
the
report
proved
true
of
attempting
a
deep
revenge
to
her
favourite
woman
only
she
confided
the
plan
of
her
journey
and
she
engaged
her
to
partake
of
it
having
collected
her
jewels
which
descending
to
her
from
many
branches
of
her
family
were
of
immense
value
and
all
her
cash
to
a
very
large
amount
they
were
packed
in
a
trunk
which
was
privately
conveyed
to
a
neighbouring
town
whither
laurentini
with
this
only
servant
followed
and
thence
proceeded
secretly
to
leghorn
where
they
embarked
for
france
when
on
her
arrival
in
languedoc
she
found
that
the
marquis
de
villeroi
had
been
married
for
some
months
her
despair
almost
deprived
her
of
reason
and
she
alternately
projected
and
abandoned
the
horrible
design
of
murdering
the
marquis
his
wife
and
herself
at
length
she
contrived
to
throw
herself
in
his
way
with
an
intention
of
reproaching
him
for
his
conduct
and
of
stabbing
herself
in
his
presence
but
when
she
again
saw
him
who
so
long
had
been
the
constant
object
of
her
thoughts
and
affections
resentment
yielded
to
love
her
resolution
failed
she
trembled
with
the
conflict
of
emotions
that
assailed
her
heart
and
fainted
away
the
marquis
was
not
proof
against
her
beauty
and
sensibility
all
the
energy
with
which
he
had
first
loved
returned
for
his
passion
had
been
resisted
by
prudence
rather
than
overcome
by
indifference
and
since
the
honour
of
his
family
would
not
permit
him
to
marry
her
he
had
endeavoured
to
subdue
his
love
and
had
so
far
succeeded
as
to
select
the
then
marchioness
for
his
wife
whom
he
loved
at
first
with
a
tempered
and
rational
affection
but
the
mild
virtues
of
that
amiable
lady
did
not
recompense
him
for
her
indifference
which
appeared
notwithstanding
her
efforts
to
conceal
it
and
he
had
for
some
time
suspected
that
her
affections
were
engaged
by
another
person
when
laurentini
arrived
in
languedoc
this
artful
italian
soon
perceived
that
she
had
regained
her
influence
over
him
and
soothed
by
the
discovery
she
determined
to
live
and
to
employ
all
her
enchantments
to
win
his
consent
to
the
diabolical
deed
which
she
believed
was
necessary
to
the
security
of
her
happiness
she
conducted
her
scheme
with
deep
dissimulation
and
patient
perseverance
and
having
completely
estranged
the
affections
of
the
marquis
from
his
wife
whose
gentle
goodness
and
unimpassioned
manners
had
ceased
to
please
when
contrasted
with
the
captivations
of
the
italian
she
proceeded
to
awaken
in
his
mind
the
jealousy
of
pride
for
it
was
no
longer
that
of
love
and
even
pointed
out
to
him
the
person
to
whom
she
affirmed
the
marchioness
had
sacrificed
her
honour
but
laurentini
had
first
extorted
from
him
a
solemn
promise
to
forbear
avenging
himself
upon
his
rival
this
was
an
important
part
of
her
plan
for
she
knew
that
if
his
desire
of
vengeance
was
restrained
towards
one
party
it
would
burn
more
fiercely
towards
the
other
and
he
might
then
perhaps
be
prevailed
on
to
assist
in
the
horrible
act
which
would
release
him
from
the
only
barrier
that
withheld
him
from
making
her
his
wife
the
innocent
marchioness
meanwhile
observed
with
extreme
grief
the
alteration
in
her
husbandâ€™s
manners
he
became
reserved
and
thoughtful
in
her
presence
his
conduct
was
austere
and
sometimes
even
rude
and
he
left
her
for
many
hours
together
to
weep
for
his
unkindness
and
to
form
plans
for
the
recovery
of
his
affection
his
conduct
afflicted
her
the
more
because
in
obedience
to
the
command
of
her
father
she
had
accepted
his
hand
though
her
affections
were
engaged
to
another
whose
amiable
disposition
she
had
reason
to
believe
would
have
ensured
her
happiness
this
circumstance
laurentini
had
discovered
soon
after
her
arrival
in
france
and
had
made
ample
use
of
it
in
assisting
her
designs
upon
the
marquis
to
whom
she
adduced
such
seeming
proof
of
his
wifeâ€™s
infidelity
that
in
the
frantic
rage
of
wounded
honour
he
consented
to
destroy
his
wife
a
slow
poison
was
administered
and
she
fell
a
victim
to
the
jealousy
and
subtlety
of
laurentini
and
to
the
guilty
weakness
of
her
husband
but
the
moment
of
laurentiniâ€™s
triumph
the
moment
to
which
she
had
looked
forward
for
the
completion
of
all
her
wishes
proved
only
the
commencement
of
a
suffering
that
never
left
her
to
her
dying
hour
the
passion
of
revenge
which
had
in
part
stimulated
her
to
the
commission
of
this
atrocious
deed
died
even
at
the
moment
when
it
was
gratified
and
left
her
to
the
horrors
of
unavailing
pity
and
remorse
which
would
probably
have
empoisoned
all
the
years
she
had
promised
herself
with
the
marquis
de
villeroi
had
her
expectations
of
an
alliance
with
him
been
realised
but
he
too
had
found
the
moment
of
his
revenge
to
be
that
of
remorse
as
to
himself
and
detestation
as
to
the
partner
of
his
crime
the
feeling
which
he
had
mistaken
for
conviction
was
no
more
and
he
stood
astonished
and
aghast
that
no
proof
remained
of
his
wifeâ€™s
infidelity
now
that
she
had
suffered
the
punishment
of
guilt
even
when
he
was
informed
that
she
was
dying
he
had
felt
suddenly
and
unaccountably
reassured
of
her
innocence
nor
was
the
solemn
assurance
she
made
him
in
her
last
hour
capable
of
affording
him
a
stronger
conviction
of
her
blameless
conduct
in
the
first
horrors
of
remorse
and
despair
he
felt
inclined
to
deliver
up
himself
and
the
woman
who
had
plunged
him
into
this
abyss
of
guilt
into
the
hands
of
justice
but
when
the
paroxysm
of
his
suffering
was
over
his
intention
changed
laurentini
however
he
saw
only
once
afterwards
and
that
was
to
curse
her
as
the
instigator
of
his
crime
and
to
say
that
he
spared
her
life
only
on
condition
that
she
passed
the
rest
of
her
days
in
prayer
and
penance
overwhelmed
with
disappointment
on
receiving
contempt
and
abhorrence
from
the
man
for
whose
sake
she
had
not
scrupled
to
stain
her
conscience
with
human
blood
and
touched
with
horror
of
the
unavailing
crime
she
had
committed
she
renounced
the
world
and
retired
to
the
monastery
of
st
claire
a
dreadful
victim
to
unresisted
passion
the
marquis
immediately
after
the
death
of
his
wife
quitted
chã¢teau-le-blanc
to
which
he
never
returned
and
endeavoured
to
lose
the
sense
of
his
crime
amidst
the
tumult
of
war
or
the
dissipations
of
a
capital
but
his
efforts
were
vain
a
deep
dejection
hung
over
him
ever
after
for
which
his
most
intimate
friend
could
not
account
and
he
at
length
died
with
a
degree
of
horror
nearly
equal
to
that
which
laurentini
had
suffered
the
physician
who
had
observed
the
singular
appearance
of
the
unfortunate
marchioness
after
death
had
been
bribed
to
silence
and
as
the
surmises
of
a
few
of
the
servants
had
proceeded
no
further
than
a
whisper
the
affair
had
never
been
investigated
whether
this
whisper
ever
reached
the
father
of
the
marchioness
and
if
it
did
whether
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
proof
deterred
him
from
prosecuting
the
marquis
de
villeroi
is
uncertain
but
her
death
was
deeply
lamented
by
some
part
of
her
family
and
particularly
by
her
brother
m
st
aubert
for
that
was
the
degree
of
relationship
which
had
existed
between
emilyâ€™s
father
and
the
marchioness
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
suspected
the
manner
of
her
death
many
letters
passed
between
the
marquis
and
him
soon
after
the
decease
of
his
beloved
sister
the
subject
of
which
was
not
known
but
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
they
related
to
the
cause
of
her
death
and
these
were
the
papers
together
with
some
letters
of
the
marchioness
who
had
confided
to
her
brother
the
occasion
of
her
unhappiness
which
st
aubert
had
so
solemnly
enjoined
his
daughter
to
destroy
and
anxiety
for
her
peace
had
probably
made
him
forbid
her
to
enquire
into
the
melancholy
story
to
which
they
alluded
such
indeed
had
been
his
affliction
on
the
premature
death
of
this
his
favourite
sister
whose
unhappy
marriage
had
from
the
first
excited
his
tenderest
pity
that
he
never
could
hear
her
named
or
mention
her
himself
after
her
death
except
to
madame
st
aubert
from
emily
whose
sensibility
he
feared
to
awaken
he
had
so
carefully
concealed
her
history
and
name
that
she
was
ignorant
till
now
that
she
ever
had
such
a
relative
as
the
marchioness
de
villeroi
and
from
this
motive
he
had
enjoined
silence
to
his
only
surviving
sister
madame
cheron
who
had
scrupulously
observed
his
request
it
was
over
some
of
the
last
pathetic
letters
of
the
marchioness
that
st
aubert
was
weeping
when
he
was
observed
by
emily
on
the
eve
of
her
departure
from
la
vallã©e
and
it
was
her
picture
which
he
had
so
tenderly
caressed
her
disastrous
death
may
account
for
the
emotion
he
had
betrayed
on
hearing
her
named
by
la
voisin
and
for
his
request
to
be
interred
near
the
monument
of
the
villerois
where
her
remains
were
deposited
but
not
those
of
her
husband
who
was
buried
where
he
died
in
the
north
of
france
the
confessor
who
attended
st
aubert
in
his
last
moments
recollected
him
to
be
the
brother
of
the
late
marchioness
when
st
aubert
from
tenderness
to
emily
had
conjured
him
to
conceal
the
circumstance
and
to
request
that
the
abbess
to
whose
care
he
particularly
recommended
her
would
do
the
same
a
request
which
had
been
exactly
observed
laurentini
on
her
arrival
in
france
had
carefully
concealed
her
name
and
family
and
the
better
to
disguise
her
real
history
had
on
entering
the
convent
caused
the
story
to
be
circulated
which
had
imposed
on
sister
frances
and
it
is
probable
that
the
abbess
who
did
not
preside
in
the
convent
at
the
time
of
her
noviciation
was
also
entirely
ignorant
of
the
truth
the
deep
remorse
that
seized
on
the
mind
of
laurentini
together
with
the
sufferings
of
disappointed
passion
for
she
still
loved
the
marquis
again
unsettled
her
intellects
and
after
the
first
paroxysms
of
despair
were
passed
a
heavy
and
silent
melancholy
had
settled
upon
her
spirits
which
suffered
few
interruptions
from
fits
of
frenzy
till
the
time
of
her
death
during
many
years
it
had
been
her
only
amusement
to
walk
in
the
woods
near
the
monastery
in
the
solitary
hours
of
night
and
to
play
upon
a
favourite
instrument
to
which
she
sometimes
joined
the
delightful
melody
of
her
voice
in
the
most
solemn
and
melancholy
airs
of
her
native
country
modulated
by
all
the
energetic
feeling
that
dwelt
in
her
heart
the
physician
who
had
attended
her
recommended
it
to
the
superior
to
indulge
her
in
this
whim
as
the
only
means
of
soothing
her
distempered
fancy
and
she
was
suffered
to
walk
in
the
lonely
hours
of
night
attended
by
the
servant
who
had
accompanied
her
from
italy
but
as
the
indulgence
transgressed
against
the
rules
of
the
convent
it
was
kept
as
secret
as
possible
and
thus
the
mysterious
music
of
laurentini
had
combined
with
other
circumstances
to
produce
a
report
that
not
only
the
chã¢teau
but
its
neighbourhood
was
haunted
soon
after
her
entrance
into
this
holy
community
and
before
she
had
shown
any
symptoms
of
insanity
there
she
made
a
will
in
which
after
bequeathing
a
considerable
legacy
to
the
convent
she
divided
the
remainder
of
her
personal
property
which
her
jewels
made
very
valuable
between
the
wife
of
mons
bonnac
who
was
an
italian
lady
and
her
relation
and
the
nearest
surviving
relative
of
the
late
marchioness
de
villeroi
as
emily
st
aubert
was
not
only
the
nearest
but
the
sole
relative
this
legacy
descended
to
her
and
thus
explained
to
her
the
whole
mystery
of
her
fatherâ€™s
conduct
the
resemblance
between
emily
and
her
unfortunate
aunt
had
frequently
been
observed
by
laurentini
and
had
occasioned
the
singular
behaviour
which
had
formerly
alarmed
her
but
it
was
in
the
nunâ€™s
dying
hour
when
her
conscience
gave
her
perpetually
the
idea
of
the
marchioness
that
she
became
more
sensible
than
ever
of
this
likeness
and
in
her
frenzy
deemed
it
no
resemblance
of
the
person
she
had
injured
but
the
original
herself
the
bold
assertion
that
had
followed
on
the
recovery
of
her
senses
that
emily
was
the
daughter
of
the
marchioness
de
villeroi
arose
from
a
suspicion
that
she
was
so
for
knowing
that
her
rival
when
she
married
the
marquis
was
attached
to
another
lover
she
had
scarcely
scrupled
to
believe
that
her
honour
had
been
sacrificed
like
her
own
to
an
unresisted
passion
of
a
crime
however
to
which
emily
had
suspected
from
her
frenzied
confession
of
murder
that
she
had
been
instrumental
in
the
castle
of
udolpho
laurentini
was
innocent
and
she
had
herself
been
deceived
concerning
the
spectacle
that
formerly
occasioned
her
so
much
terror
and
had
since
compelled
her
for
a
while
to
attribute
the
horrors
of
the
nun
to
a
consciousness
of
a
murder
committed
in
that
castle
it
may
be
remembered
that
in
a
chamber
of
udolpho
hung
a
black
veil
whose
singular
situation
had
excited
emilyâ€™s
curiosity
and
which
afterwards
disclosed
an
object
that
had
overwhelmed
her
with
horror
for
on
lifting
it
there
appeared
instead
of
the
picture
she
had
expected
within
a
recess
of
the
wall
a
human
figure
of
ghastly
paleness
stretched
at
its
length
and
dressed
in
the
habiliments
of
the
grave
what
added
to
the
horror
of
the
spectacle
was
that
the
face
appeared
partly
decayed
and
disfigured
by
worms
which
were
visible
on
the
features
and
hands
on
such
an
object
it
will
be
readily
believed
that
no
person
could
endure
to
look
twice
emily
it
may
be
recollected
had
after
the
first
glance
let
the
veil
drop
and
her
terror
had
prevented
her
from
ever
after
provoking
a
renewal
of
such
suffering
as
she
had
then
experienced
had
she
dared
to
look
again
her
delusion
and
her
fears
would
have
vanished
together
and
she
would
have
perceived
that
the
figure
before
her
was
not
human
but
formed
of
wax
the
history
of
it
is
somewhat
extraordinary
though
not
without
example
in
the
records
of
that
fierce
severity
which
monkish
superstition
has
sometimes
inflicted
on
mankind
a
member
of
the
house
of
udolpho
having
committed
some
offence
against
the
prerogative
of
the
church
had
been
condemned
to
the
penance
of
contemplating
during
certain
hours
of
the
day
a
waxen
image
made
to
resemble
a
human
body
in
the
state
to
which
it
is
reduced
after
death
this
penance
serving
as
a
memento
of
the
condition
at
which
he
must
himself
arrive
had
been
designed
to
reprove
the
pride
of
the
marquis
of
udolpho
which
had
formerly
so
much
exasperated
that
of
the
romish
church
and
he
had
not
only
superstitiously
observed
this
penance
himself
which
he
had
believed
was
to
obtain
a
pardon
for
all
his
sins
but
had
made
it
a
condition
in
his
will
that
his
descendants
should
preserve
the
image
on
pain
of
forfeiting
to
the
church
a
certain
part
of
his
domain
that
they
also
might
profit
by
the
humiliating
moral
it
conveyed
the
figure
therefore
had
been
suffered
to
retain
its
station
in
the
wall
of
the
chamber
but
his
descendants
excused
themselves
from
observing
the
penance
to
which
he
had
been
enjoined
this
image
was
so
horribly
natural
that
it
is
not
surprising
emily
should
have
mistaken
it
for
the
object
it
resembled
nor
since
she
had
heard
such
an
extraordinary
account
concerning
the
disappearing
of
the
late
lady
of
the
castle
and
had
such
experience
of
the
character
of
montoni
that
she
should
have
believed
this
to
be
the
murdered
body
of
the
lady
laurentini
and
that
he
had
been
the
contriver
of
her
death
the
situation
in
which
she
had
discovered
it
occasioned
her
at
first
much
surprise
and
perplexity
but
the
vigilance
with
which
the
doors
of
the
chamber
where
it
was
deposited
were
afterwards
secured
had
compelled
her
to
believe
that
montoni
not
daring
to
confide
the
secret
of
her
death
to
any
person
had
suffered
her
remains
to
decay
in
this
obscure
chamber
the
ceremony
of
the
veil
however
and
the
circumstance
of
the
doors
having
been
left
open
even
for
a
moment
had
occasioned
her
much
wonder
and
some
doubts
but
these
were
not
sufficient
to
overcome
her
suspicion
of
montoni
and
it
was
the
dread
of
his
terrible
vengeance
that
had
sealed
her
lips
in
silence
concerning
what
she
had
seen
in
the
west
chamber
emily
in
discovering
the
marchioness
de
villeroi
to
have
been
the
sister
of
mons
st
aubert
was
variously
affected
but
amidst
the
sorrow
which
she
suffered
for
her
untimely
death
she
was
released
from
an
anxious
and
painful
conjecture
occasioned
by
the
rash
assertion
of
signora
laurentini
concerning
her
birth
and
the
honour
of
her
parents
her
faith
in
st
aubertâ€™s
principles
would
scarcely
allow
her
to
suspect
that
he
had
acted
dishonourably
and
she
felt
such
reluctance
to
believe
herself
the
daughter
of
any
other
than
her
whom
she
had
always
considered
and
loved
as
a
mother
that
she
would
hardly
admit
such
a
circumstance
to
be
possible
yet
the
likeness
which
it
had
frequently
been
affirmed
she
bore
to
the
late
marchioness
the
former
behaviour
of
dorothã©e
the
old
housekeeper
the
assertion
of
laurentini
and
the
mysterious
attachment
which
st
aubert
had
discovered
awakened
doubts
as
to
his
connection
with
the
marchioness
which
her
reason
could
neither
vanquish
nor
confirm
from
these
however
she
was
now
relieved
and
all
the
circumstances
of
her
fatherâ€™s
conduct
were
fully
explained
but
her
heart
was
oppressed
by
the
melancholy
catastrophe
of
her
amiable
relative
and
by
the
awful
lesson
which
the
history
of
the
nun
exhibited
the
indulgence
of
whose
passions
had
been
the
means
of
leading
her
gradually
to
the
commission
of
a
crime
from
the
prophecy
of
which
in
her
early
years
she
would
have
recoiled
in
horror
and
exclaimedâ€”that
it
could
not
beâ€”a
crime
which
whole
years
of
repentance
and
of
the
severest
penance
had
not
been
able
to
obliterate
from
her
conscience
then
fresh
tears
stood
on
her
cheek
as
doth
the

upon

gatherâ€™d
lily
almost
witherâ€™d
shakespeare
after
the
late
discoveries
emily
was
distinguished
at
the
chã¢teau
by
the
count
and
his
family
as
a
relative
of
the
house
of
villeroi
and
received
if
possible
more
friendly
attention
than
had
yet
been
shown
her
count
de
villefortâ€™s
surprise
at
the
delay
of
an
answer
to
his
letter
which
had
been
directed
to
valancourt
at
estuviã¨re
was
mingled
with
satisfaction
for
the
prudence
which
had
saved
emily
from
a
share
of
the
anxiety
he
now
suffered
though
when
he
saw
her
still
drooping
under
the
effect
of
his
former
error
all
his
resolution
was
necessary
to
restrain
him
from
relating
the
truth
that
would
afford
her
a
momentary
relief
the
approaching
nuptials
of
the
lady
blanche
now
divided
his
attention
with
this
subject
of
his
anxiety
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
chã¢teau
were
already
busied
in
preparations
for
that
event
and
the
arrival
of
mons
st
foix
was
daily
expected
in
the
gaiety
which
surrounded
her
emily
vainly
tried
to
participate
her
spirits
being
depressed
by
the
late
discoveries
and
by
the
anxiety
concerning
the
fate
of
valancourt
that
had
been
occasioned
by
the
description
of
his
manner
when
he
had
delivered
the
ring
she
seemed
to
perceive
in
it
the
gloomy
wildness
of
despair
and
when
she
considered
to
what
that
despair
might
have
urged
him
her
heart
sunk
with
terror
and
grief
the
state
of
suspense
as
to
his
safety
to
which
she
believed
herself
condemned
till
she
should
return
to
la
vallã©e
appeared
insupportable
and
in
such
moments
she
could
not
even
struggle
to
assume
the
composure
that
had
left
her
mind
but
would
often
abruptly
quit
the
company
she
was
with
and
endeavour
to
sooth
her
spirits
in
the
deep
solitudes
of
the
woods
that
overbrowed
the
shore
here
the
faint
roar
of
foaming
waves
that
beat
below
and
the
sullen
murmur
of
the
wind
among
the
branches
around
were
circumstances
in
unison
with
the
temper
of
her
mind
and
she
would
sit
on
a
cliff
or
on
the
broken
steps
of
her
favourite
watch-tower
observing
the
changing
colours
of
the
evening
clouds
and
the
gloom
of
twilight
draw
over
the
sea
till
the
white
tops
of
billows
riding
towards
the
shore
could
scarcely
be
discerned
amidst
the
darkened
waters
the
lines
engraved
by
valancourt
on
this
tower
she
frequently
repeated
with
melancholy
enthusiasm
and
then
would
endeavour
to
check
the
recollections
and
the
grief
they
occasioned
and
to
turn
her
thoughts
to
indifferent
subjects
one
evening
having
wandered
with
her
lute
to
this
her
favourite
spot
she
entered
the
ruined
tower
and
ascended
a
winding
staircase
that
led
to
a
small
chamber
which
was
less
decayed
than
the
rest
of
the
building
and
whence
she
had
often
gazed
with
admiration
on
the
wide
prospect
of
sea
and
land
that
extended
below
the
sun
was
now
setting
on
that
tract
of
the
pyrenees
which
divided
languedoc
from
rousillon
and
placing
herself
opposite
to
a
small
grated
window
which
like
the
wood-tops
beneath
and
the
waves
lower
still
gleamed
with
the
red
glow
of
the
west
she
touched
the
chords
of
her
lute
in
solemn
symphony
and
then
accompanied
it
with
her
voice
in
one
of
the
simple
and
affecting
airs
to
which
in
happier
days
valancourt
had
often
listened
in
rapture
and
which
she
now
adapted
to
the
following
lines
to
melancholy
spirit
of
love
and
sorrowâ€”hail
thy
solemn
voice
from
far
i
hear
mingling
with
evâ€™ningâ€™s
dying
gale
hail
with
this
sadly-pleasing
tear
o
at
this
still
this
lonely
hour
thine
own
sweet
hour
of
closing
day
awake
thy
lute
whose
charmful
powâ€™r
shall
call
up
fancy
to
obey
to
paint
the
wild
romantic
dream
that
meets
the
poetâ€™s
musing
eye
as
on
the
bank
of
shadowy
stream
he
breathes
to
her
the
fervid
sigh
o
lonely
spirit
let
thy
song
lead
me
through
all
thy
sacred
haunt
the
ministerâ€™s
moonlight
aisles
along
where
spectres
raise
the
midnight
chaunt
i
hear
their
dirges
faintly
swell
then
sink
at
once
in
silence
drear
while
from
the
pillarâ€™d
cloisterâ€™s
cell
dimly
their
gliding
forms
appear
lead
where
the
pine-woods
wave
on
high
whose
pathless
sod
is
darkly
seen
as
the
cold
moon
with
trembling
eye
darts
her
long
beams
the
leaves
between
lead
to
the
mountainâ€™s
dusky
head
where
far
below
in
shade
profound
wide
forests
plains
and
hamlets
spread
and
sad
the
chimes
of
vesper
sound
or
guide
me
where
the
dashing
oar
just
breaks
the
stillness
of
the
vale
as
slow
it
tracks
the
winding
shore
to
meet
the
oceanâ€™s
distant
sail
to
pebbly
banks
that
neptune
laves
with
measurâ€™d
surges
loud
and
deep
where
the
dark
cliff
bends
oâ€™er
the
waves
and
wild
the
winds
of
autumn
sweep
there
pause
at
midnightâ€™s
spectred
hour
and
list
the
long-resounding
gale
and
catch
the
fleeting
moonlightâ€™s
powâ€™r
oâ€™er
foaming
seas
and
distant
sail
the
soft
tranquillity
of
the
scene
below
where
the
evening
breeze
scarcely
curled
the
water
or
swelled
the
passing
sail
that
caught
the
last
gleam
of
the
sun
and
where
now
and
then
a
dipping
oar
was
all
that
disturbed
the
trembling
radiance
conspired
with
the
tender
melody
of
her
lute
to
lull
her
mind
into
a
state
of
gentle
sadness
and
she
sung
the
mournful
songs
of
past
times
till
the
remembrances
they
awakened
were
too
powerful
for
her
heart
her
tears
fell
upon
the
lute
over
which
she
drooped
and
her
voice
trembled
and
was
unable
to
proceed
though
the
sun
had
now
sunk
behind
the
mountains
and
even
his
reflected
light
was
fading
from
their
highest
points
emily
did
not
leave
the
watch-tower
but
continued
to
indulge
her
melancholy
reverie
till
a
footstep
at
a
little
distance
startled
her
and
on
looking
through
the
grate
she
observed
a
person
walking
below
whom
however
soon
perceiving
to
be
mons
bonnac
she
returned
to
the
quiet
thoughtfulness
his
step
had
interrupted
after
some
time
she
again
struck
her
lute
and
sung
her
favourite
air
but
again
a
step
disturbed
her
and
as
she
paused
to
listen
she
heard
it
ascending
the
staircase
of
the
tower
the
gloom
of
the
hour
perhaps
made
her
sensible
to
some
degree
of
fear
which
she
might
not
otherwise
have
felt
for
only
a
few
minutes
before
she
had
seen
mons
bonnac
pass
the
steps
were
quick
and
bounding
and
in
the
next
moment
the
door
of
the
chamber
opened
and
a
person
entered
whose
features
were
veiled
in
the
obscurity
of
twilight
but
his
voice
could
not
be
concealed
for
it
was
the
voice
of
valancourt
at
the
sound
never
heard
by
emily
without
emotion
she
started
in
terror
astonishment
and
doubtful
pleasure
and
had
scarcely
beheld
him
at
her
feet
when
she
sunk
into
a
seat
overcome
by
the
various
emotions
that
contended
at
her
heart
and
almost
insensible
to
that
voice
whose
earnest
and
trembling
calls
seemed
as
if
endeavouring
to
save
her
valancourt
as
he
hung
over
emily
deplored
his
own
rash
impatience
in
having
thus
surprised
her
for
when
he
had
arrived
at
the
chã¢teau
too
anxious
to
await
the
return
of
the
count
who
he
understood
was
in
the
grounds
he
went
himself
to
seek
him
when
as
he
passed
the
tower
he
was
struck
by
the
sound
of
emilyâ€™s
voice
and
immediately
ascended
it
was
a
considerable
time
before
she
revived
but
when
her
recollection
returned
she
repulsed
his
attentions
with
an
air
of
reserve
and
enquired
with
as
much
displeasure
as
it
was
possible
she
could
feel
in
these
first
moments
of
his
appearance
the
occasion
of
his
visit
â€œah
emilyâ€
said
valancourt
â€œthat
air
those
wordsâ€”alas
i
have
then
little
to
hopeâ€”when
you
ceased
to
esteem
me
you
ceased
also
to
love
meâ€
â€œmost
true
sirâ€
replied
emily
endeavouring
to
command
her
trembling
voice
â€œand
if
you
had
valued
my
esteem
you
would
not
have
given
me
this
new
occasion
for
uneasinessâ€
valancourtâ€™s
countenance
changed
suddenly
from
the
anxieties
of
doubt
to
an
expression
of
surprise
and
dismay
he
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
said
â€œi
had
been
taught
to
hope
for
a
very
different
reception
is
it
then
true
emily
that
i
have
lost
your
regard
for
ever
am
i
to
believe
that
though
your
esteem
for
me
may
returnâ€”your
affection
never
can
can
the
count
have
meditated
the
cruelty
which
now
tortures
me
with
a
second
deathâ€
the
voice
in
which
he
spoke
this
alarmed
emily
as
much
as
his
words
surprised
her
and
with
trembling
impatience
she
begged
that
he
would
explain
them
â€œcan
any
explanation
be
necessaryâ€
said
valancourt
â€œdo
you
not
know
how
cruelly
my
conduct
has
been
misrepresented
that
the
actions
of
which
you
once
believed
me
guilty
and
o
emily
how
could
you
so
degrade
me
in
your
opinion
even
for
a
moment
those
actionsâ€”i
hold
in
as
much
contempt
and
abhorrence
as
yourself
are
you
indeed
ignorant
that
count
de
villefort
has
detected
the
slanders
that
have
robbed
me
of
all
i
hold
dear
on
earth
and
has
invited
me
hither
to
justify
to
you
my
former
conduct
it
is
surely
impossible
you
can
be
uninformed
of
these
circumstances
and
i
am
again
torturing
myself
with
a
false
hopeâ€
the
silence
of
emily
confirmed
this
supposition
for
the
deep
twilight
would
not
allow
valancourt
to
distinguish
the
astonishment
and
doubting
joy
that
fixed
her
features
for
a
moment
she
continued
unable
to
speak
then
a
profound
sigh
seemed
to
give
some
relief
to
her
spirits
and
she
said
â€œvalancourt
i
was
till
this
moment
ignorant
of
all
the
circumstances
you
have
mentioned
the
emotion
i
now
suffer
may
assure
you
of
the
truth
of
this
and
that
though
i
had
ceased
to
esteem
i
had
not
taught
myself
entirely
to
forget
youâ€
â€œthis
momentâ€
said
valancourt
in
a
low
voice
and
leaning
for
support
against
the
windowâ€”â€œthis
moment
brings
with
it
a
conviction
that
overpowers
meâ€”i
am
dear
to
you
thenâ€”still
dear
to
you
my
emilyâ€
â€œis
it
necessary
that
i
should
tell
you
soâ€
she
replied
â€œis
it
necessary
that
i
should
sayâ€”these
are
the
first
moments
of
joy
i
have
known
since
your
departure
and
that
they
repay
me
for
all
those
of
pain
i
have
suffered
in
the
intervalâ€
valancourt
sighed
deeply
and
was
unable
to
reply
but
as
he
pressed
her
hand
to
his
lips
the
tears
that
fell
over
it
spoke
a
language
which
could
not
be
mistaken
and
to
which
words
were
inadequate
emily
somewhat
tranquillized
proposed
returning
to
the
chã¢teau
and
then
for
the
first
time
recollected
that
the
count
had
invited
valancourt
thither
to
explain
his
conduct
and
that
no
explanation
had
yet
been
given
but
while
she
acknowledged
this
her
heart
would
not
allow
her
to
dwell
for
a
moment
on
the
possibility
of
his
unworthiness
his
look
his
voice
his
manner
all
spoke
the
noble
sincerity
which
had
formerly
distinguished
him
and
she
again
permitted
herself
to
indulge
the
emotions
of
a
joy
more
surprising
and
powerful
than
she
had
ever
before
experienced
neither
emily
nor
valancourt
were
conscious
how
they
reached
the
chã¢teau
whither
they
might
have
been
transferred
by
the
spell
of
a
fairy
for
anything
they
could
remember
and
it
was
not
till
they
had
reached
the
great
hall
that
either
of
them
recollected
there
were
other
persons
in
the
world
besides
themselves
the
count
then
came
forth
with
surprise
and
with
the
joyfulness
of
pure
benevolence
to
welcome
valancourt
and
to
entreat
his
forgiveness
of
the
injustice
he
had
done
him
soon
after
which
mons
bonnac
joined
this
happy
group
in
which
he
and
valancourt
were
mutually
rejoiced
to
meet
when
the
first
congratulations
were
over
and
the
general
joy
became
somewhat
more
tranquil
the
count
withdrew
with
valancourt
to
the
library
where
a
long
conversation
passed
between
them
in
which
the
latter
so
clearly
justified
himself
of
the
criminal
parts
of
the
conduct
imputed
to
him
and
so
candidly
confessed
and
so
feelingly
lamented
the
follies
which
he
had
committed
that
the
count
was
confirmed
in
his
belief
of
all
he
had
hoped
and
while
he
perceived
so
many
noble
virtues
in
valancourt
and
that
experience
had
taught
him
to
detest
the
follies
which
before
he
had
only
not
admired
he
did
not
scruple
to
believe
that
he
would
pass
through
life
with
the
dignity
of
a
wise
and
good
man
or
to
entrust
to
his
care
the
future
happiness
of
emily
st
aubert
for
whom
he
felt
the
solicitude
of
a
parent
of
this
he
soon
informed
her
in
a
short
conversation
when
valancourt
had
left
him
while
emily
listened
to
a
relation
of
the
services
that
valancourt
had
rendered
mons
bonnac
her
eyes
overflowed
with
tears
of
pleasure
and
the
further
conversation
of
count
de
villefort
perfectly
dissipated
every
doubt
as
to
the
past
and
future
conduct
of
him
to
whom
she
now
restored
without
fear
the
esteem
and
affection
with
which
she
had
formerly
received
him
when
they
returned
to
the
supper-room
the
countess
and
lady
blanche
met
valancourt
with
sincere
congratulations
and
blanche
indeed
was
so
much
rejoiced
to
see
emily
returned
to
happiness
as
to
forget
for
a
while
that
mons
st
foix
was
not
yet
arrived
at
the
chã¢teau
though
he
had
been
expected
for
some
hours
but
her
generous
sympathy
was
soon
after
rewarded
by
his
appearance
he
was
now
perfectly
recovered
from
the
wounds
received
during
his
perilous
adventure
among
the
pyrenees
the
mention
of
which
served
to
heighten
to
the
parties
who
had
been
involved
in
it
the
sense
of
their
present
happiness
new
congratulations
passed
between
them
and
round
the
supper-table
appeared
a
group
of
faces
smiling
with
felicity
but
with
a
felicity
which
had
in
each
a
different
character
the
smile
of
blanche
was
frank
and
gay
that
of
emily
tender
and
pensive
valancourtâ€™s
was
rapturous
tender
and
gay
alternately
mons
st
foixâ€™s
was
joyous
and
that
of
the
count
as
he
looked
on
the
surrounding
party
expressed
the
tempered
complacency
of
benevolence
while
the
features
of
the
countess
henri
and
mons
bonnac
discovered
fainter
traces
of
animation
poor
mons
du
pont
did
not
by
his
presence
throw
a
shade
of
regret
over
the
company
for
when
he
had
discovered
that
valancourt
was
not
unworthy
of
the
esteem
of
emily
he
determined
seriously
to
endeavour
at
the
conquest
of
his
own
hopeless
affection
and
had
immediately
withdrawn
from
chã¢teau-le-blancâ€”a
conduct
which
emily
now
understood
and
rewarded
with
her
admiration
and
pity
the
count
and
his
guests
continued
together
till
a
late
hour
yielding
to
the
delights
of
social
gaiety
and
to
the
sweets
of
friendship
when
annette
heard
of
the
arrival
of
valancourt
ludovico
had
some
difficulty
to
prevent
her
going
into
the
supper-room
to
express
her
joy
for
she
declared
that
she
had
never
been
so
rejoiced
at
any
accident
as
this
since
she
had
found
ludovico
himself
now
my
task
is
smoothly
done
i
can
fly
or
i
can
run
quickly
to
the
green
earthâ€™s
end
where
the
bowâ€™d
welkin
low
doth
bend
and
from
thence
can
soar
as
soon
to
the
corners
of
the
moon
milton
the
marriages
of
the
lady
blanche
and
emily
st
aubert
were
celebrated
on
the
same
day
and
with
the
ancient
baronial
magnificence
at
chã¢teau-le-blanc
the
feasts
were
held
in
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
which
on
this
occasion
was
hung
with
superb
new
tapestry
representing
the
exploits
of
charlemagne
and
his
twelve
peers
here
were
seen
the
saracens
with
their
horrible
visors
advancing
to
battle
and
there
were
displayed
the
wild
solemnities
of
incantation
and
the
necromantic
feats
exhibited
by
the
magician
jarl
before
the
emperor
the
sumptuous
banners
of
the
family
of
villeroi
which
had
long
slept
in
dust
were
once
more
unfurled
to
wave
over
the
gothic
points
of
painted
casements
and
music
echoed
in
many
a
lingering
close
through
every
winding
gallery
and
colonnade
of
that
vast
edifice
as
annette
looked
down
from
the
corridor
upon
the
hall
whose
arches
and
windows
were
illuminated
with
brilliant
festoons
of
lamps
and
gazed
on
the
splendid
dresses
of
the
dancers
the
costly
liveries
of
the
attendants
the
canopies
of
purple
velvet
and
gold
and
listened
to
the
gay
strains
that
floated
along
the
vaulted
roof
she
almost
fancied
herself
in
an
enchanted
palace
and
declared
that
she
had
not
met
with
any
place
which
charmed
her
so
much
since
she
read
the
fairy
tales
nay
that
the
fairies
themselves
at
their
nightly
revels
in
this
old
hall
could
display
nothing
finer
while
old
dorothã©e
as
she
surveyed
the
scene
sighed
and
said
the
castle
looked
as
it
was
wont
to
do
in
the
time
of
her
youth
after
gracing
the
festivities
of
chã¢teau-le-blanc
for
some
days
valancourt
and
emily
took
leave
of
their
kind
friends
and
returned
to
la
vallã©e
where
the
faithful
theresa
received
them
with
unfeigned
joy
and
the
pleasant
shades
welcomed
them
with
a
thousand
tender
and
affecting
remembrances
and
while
they
wandered
together
over
the
scenes
so
long
inhabited
by
the
late
mons
and
madame
st
aubert
and
emily
pointed
out
with
pensive
affection
their
favourite
haunts
her
present
happiness
was
heightened
by
considering
that
it
would
have
been
worthy
of
their
approbation
could
they
have
witnessed
it
valancourt
led
her
to
the
plane-tree
on
the
terrace
where
he
had
first
ventured
to
declare
his
love
and
where
now
the
remembrance
of
the
anxiety
he
had
then
suffered
and
the
retrospect
of
all
the
dangers
and
misfortunes
they
had
each
encountered
since
last
they
sat
together
beneath
its
broad
branches
exalted
the
sense
of
their
present
felicity
which
on
this
spot
sacred
to
the
memory
of
st
aubert
they
solemnly
vowed
to
deserve
as
far
as
possible
by
endeavouring
to
imitate
his
benevolenceâ€”by
remembering
that
superior
attainments
of
every
sort
bring
with
them
duties
of
superior
exertionâ€”and
by
affording
to
their
fellow-beings
together
with
that
portion
of
ordinary
comforts
which
prosperity
always
owes
to
misfortune
the
example
of
lives
passed
in
happy
thankfulness
to
god
and
therefore
in
careful
tenderness
to
his
creatures
soon
after
their
return
to
la
vallã©e
the
brother
of
valancourt
came
to
congratulate
him
on
his
marriage
and
to
pay
his
respects
to
emily
with
whom
he
was
so
much
pleased
as
well
as
with
the
prospect
of
rational
happiness
which
these
nuptials
offered
to
valancourt
that
he
immediately
resigned
to
him
a
part
of
the
rich
domain
the
whole
of
which
as
he
had
no
family
would
of
course
descend
to
his
brother
on
his
decease
the
estates
at
thoulouse
were
disposed
of
and
emily
purchased
of
mons
quesnel
the
ancient
domain
of
her
late
father
where
having
given
annette
a
marriage
portion
she
settled
her
as
the
housekeeper
and
ludovico
as
the
steward
but
since
both
valancourt
and
herself
preferred
the
pleasant
and
long-loved
shades
of
la
vallã©e
to
the
magnificence
of
epourville
they
continued
to
reside
there
passing
however
a
few
months
in
the
year
at
the
birth-place
of
st
aubert
in
tender
respect
to
his
memory
the
legacy
which
had
been
bequeathed
to
emily
by
signora
laurentini
she
begged
valancourt
would
allow
her
to
resign
to
mons
bonnac
and
valancourt
when
she
made
the
request
felt
all
the
value
of
the
compliment
it
conveyed
the
castle
of
udolpho
also
descended
to
the
wife
of
mons
bonnac
who
was
the
nearest
surviving
relation
of
the
house
of
that
name
and
thus
affluence
restored
his
long-oppressed
spirits
to
peace
and
his
family
to
comfort
o
how
joyful
it
is
to
tell
of
happiness
such
as
that
of
valancourt
and
emily
to
relate
that
after
suffering
under
the
oppression
of
the
vicious
and
the
disdain
of
the
weak
they
were
at
length
restored
to
each
otherâ€”to
the
beloved
landscapes
of
their
native
countryâ€”to
the
securest
felicity
of
this
life
that
of
aspiring
to
moral
and
labouring
for
intellectual
improvementâ€”to
the
pleasures
of
enlightened
society
and
to
the
exercise
of
the
benevolence
which
had
always
animated
their
hearts
while
the
bowers
of
la
vallã©e
became
once
more
the
retreat
of
goodness
wisdom
and
domestic
blessedness
o
useful
may
it
be
to
have
shown
that
though
the
vicious
can
sometimes
pour
affliction
upon
the
good
their
power
is
transient
and
their
punishment
certain
and
that
innocence
though
oppressed
by
injustice
shall
supported
by
patience
finally
triumph
over
misfortune
and
if
the
weak
hand
that
has
recorded
this
tale
has
by
its
scenes
beguiled
the
mourner
of
one
hour
of
sorrow
or
by
its
moral
taught
him
to
sustain
itâ€”the
effort
however
humble
has
not
been
vain
nor
is
the
writer
unrewarded
