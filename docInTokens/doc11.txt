if
human
beings
with
all
their
vices
have
a
future
life
assuredly
animals
who
in
character
so
often
equal
nay
excel
human
beings
have
a
future
life
also
those
who
in
the
scriptures
find
a
key
to
all
things
can
find
nothing
in
them
to
confute
this
argument
there
is
no
saying
of
christ
that
justifies
one
in
supposing
that
man
is
the
only
being
whose
existence
extends
beyond
the
grave
granted
however
merely
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
we
have
some
ground
for
the
denial
of
a
future
existence
for
animals
consider
the
injustice
such
a
denial
would
involve
take
for
example
the
case
of
the
horse
harming
no
one
and
without
thought
of
reward
it
toils
for
man
all
its
life
and
when
too
old
to
work
it
is
put
to
death
without
even
the
compensation
of
a
well-earned
rest
but
if
compensation
be
god's
law--as
i
for
one
believe
it
to
be--and
also
the
raison
d'ãªtre
of
a
hereafter
then
surely
the
creator
whose
chief
claim
to
our
respect
and
veneration
lies
in
the
fact
that
he
is
just
and
merciful
will
take
good
care
that
the
horse--the
gentle
patient
never-complaining
horse--is
well
compensated--compensated
in
a
golden
hereafter
consider
again
the
case
of
another
of
our
four-footed
friends--the
dog
the
faithful
affectionate
obedient
and
forgiving
dog
the
dog
who
is
so
often
called
upon
to
stand
all
sorts
of
rough
treatment
and
is
shot
or
poisoned
if
provoked
beyond
endurance
he
at
last
rounds
on
his
persecutors
and
bites
and
the
cat--the
timid
peaceful
cat
who
is
mauled
and
all
but
pulled
in
two
by
cruel
children
and
beaten
to
a
jelly
when
in
sheer
agony
and
fright
it
scratches
reflect
again
on
the
cow
and
the
sheep
fed
only
to
supply
our
wants
shouted
at
and
kicked
if
when
nearly
scared
out
of
their
senses
they
wander
off
the
track
and
pole-axed
or
done
to
death
in
some
equally
atrocious
manner
when
the
sickening
demand
for
flesh
food
is
at
its
height
and
yet
you
say
these
innocent
unoffending--and
i
say
martyred--animals
are
to
have
no
future
no
compensation
monstrous
absurd
it
is
an
effrontery
to
common
sense
philosophy--anything
everything
it
is
a
damned
lie
damned
bigotry
damned
nonsense
the
whole
animal
world
will
live
again
and
it
will
be
man--spoilt
presumptuous
degenerate
man--who
will
not
participate
in
another
life
unless
he
very
much
improves
think
well
over
this--you
who
preach
the
gospel
of
man's
pre-eminence--you
who
prate
of
god
and
know
nothing
whatsoever
about
him
the
horse
dog
cat--even
the
wild
animals
whose
vices
perchance
pale
beside
your
own
may
go
to
heaven
before
you
the
supreme
architect
is
neither
a
nero
nor
a
stuart
nor
a
clown
he
will
recompense
all
who
deserve
recompense
be
they
great
or
small--biped
or
quadruped
it
is
to
testify
to
a
future
existence
for
animals
and
to
create
a
wider
interest
in
it
that
i
have
undertaken
to
compile
this
book
and
my
object
i
think
can
best
be
achieved
in
my
own
way
the
way
of
the
investigator
of
haunted
places
the
mere
fact
that
there
are
manifestations
of
dead
people
pardon
the
paradox
proves
some
kind
of
life
after
death
for
human
beings
and
happily
the
same
proof
is
available
with
regard
a
future
life
for
animals
indeed
there
are
as
many
animal
phantasms
as
human--perhaps
more
hence
if
the
human
being
lives
again
so
do
his
dumb
friends
be
comforted
then
you
who
love
your
pets
and
have
been
kind
to
them
you
will
see
them
all
again
on
the
soft
undying
pasture
lands
of
your
elysium
and
theirs
be
warned
you--you
who
have
despised
animals
and
have
been
cruel
to
them
who
knows
but
that
in
your
future
life
you
may
be
as
they
are
now--in
subjection

ghosts
cats
in
opening
this
volume
on
animals
and
their
associations
with
the
unknown
i
will
commence
with
a
case
of
hauntings
in
the
old
manor
house
at
oxenby
my
informant
was
a
mrs
hartnoll
whom
i
can
see
in
my
mind's
eye
as
distinctly
as
if
i
were
looking
at
her
now
hers
was
a
personality
that
no
lapse
of
time
nothing
could
efface
a
personality
that
made
itself
felt
on
boys
of
all
temperaments
most
of
all
of
course
on
those
who--like
myself--were
highly
strung
and
sensitive
she
was
classical
mistress
at
l's
the
then
well-known
dame
school
in
clifton
where
for
three
years--prior
to
migrating
to
a
public
school--i
was
well
grounded
in
all
the
mysticisms
of
kennedy's
latin
primer
and
smith's
first
greek
principia
i
doubt
if
she
got
anything
more
than
a
very
small
salary--governesses
in
those
days
were
shockingly
remunerated--and
i
know--poor
soul
she
had
to
work
monstrously
hard
drumming
latin
and
greek
into
heads
as
thick
as
ours
was
no
easy
task
but
there
were
times
when
the
excessive
tension
on
the
nerves
proving
too
much
mrs
hartnoll
stole
a
little
relaxation
when
she
allowed
herself
to
chat
with
us
and
even
to
smile--heavens
those
smiles
and
when--i
can
feel
the
tingling
of
my
pulses
at
the
bare
mention
of
it--she
spoke
about
herself
stated
she
had
once
been
young--a
declaration
so
astounding
so
utterly
beyond
our
comprehension
that
we
were
rendered
quite
speechless--and
told
us
anecdotes
of
many
of
her
narratives
i
have
no
recollection
but
one
or
two
which
interested
me
more
than
the
rest
are
almost
as
fresh
in
my
mind
as
when
recounted
the
one
that
appealed
to
me
most
and
which
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
is
absolutely
true1
is
as
follows--i
give
it
as
nearly
as
i
can
in
her
own
somewhat
stilted
style--
up
to
the
age
of
nineteen
i
resided
with
my
parents
in
the
manor
house
oxenby
it
was
an
old
building
dating
back
i
believe
to
the
reign
of
edward
vi
and
had
originally
served
as
the
residence
of
noble
families
built
or
rather
faced
with
split
flints
and
edged
and
buttressed
with
cut
grey
stone
it
had
a
majestic
though
very
gloomy
appearance
and
seen
from
afar
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
a
huge
and
grotesquely
decorated
sarcophagus
in
the
centre
of
its
frowning
and
menacing
front
was
the
device
of
a
cat
constructed
out
of
black
shingles
and
having
white
shingles
for
the
eyes
the
effect
being
curiously
realistic
especially
on
moonlight
nights
when
anything
more
lifelike
and
sinister
could
scarcely
have
been
conceived
the
artist
whoever
he
was
had
a
more
than
human
knowledge
of
cats--he
portrayed
not
merely
their
bodies
but
their
souls
footnote

i
have
subsequently
met
several
people
who
experienced
the
same
phenomena
in
the
house
which
was
standing
a
short
time
ago
in
style
the
front
of
the
house
was
somewhat
castellated
two
semicircular
bows
or
half
towers
placed
at
a
suitable
distance
from
each
other
rose
from
the
base
to
the
summit
of
the
edifice
to
the
height
of
four
or
five
stairs
and
were
pierced
at
every
floor
with
rows
of
stone-mullioned
windows
the
flat
wall
between
had
larger
windows
lighting
the
great
hall
gallery
and
upper
apartments
these
windows
were
wholly
composed
of
stained
glass
engraved
with
every
imaginable
fantastic
design--imps
satyrs
dragons
witches
queer-shaped
trees
hands
eyes
circles
triangles
and
cats
the
towers
half
included
in
the
building
were
completely
circular
within
and
contained
the
winding
stairs
of
the
mansion
and
whoever
ascended
them
when
a
storm
was
raging
seemed
rising
by
a
whirlwind
to
the
clouds
in
the
upper
rooms
even
the
wildest
screams
of
the
hurricane
were
drowned
in
the
rattling
clamour
of
the
assaulted
casements
when
a
gale
of
wind
took
the
building
in
front
it
rocked
it
to
the
foundations
and
at
such
times
threatened
its
instant
demolition
midway
between
the
towers
there
stood
forth
a
heavy
stone
porch
with
a
gothic
gateway
surmounted
by
a
battlemented
parapet
made
gable
fashion
the
apex
of
which
was
garnished
by
a
pair
of
dolphins
rampant
and
antagonistic
whose
corkscrew
tails
seemed
contorted--especially
at
night--by
the
last
agonies
of
rage
convulsed
the
porch
doors
stood
open
except
in
tremendous
weather
the
inner
ones
were
regularly
shut
and
barred
after
all
who
entered
they
led
into
a
wide
vaulted
and
lofty
hall
the
walls
of
which
were
decorated
with
faded
tapestry
that
rose
and
fell
and
rustled
in
the
most
mysterious
fashion
every
time
there
was
the
suspicion--and
often
barely
the
suspicion--of
a
breeze
interspersed
with
the
tapestry--and
in
great
contrast
to
its
antiquity--were
quite
modern
and
very
ordinary
portraits
of
my
family
the
general
fittings
and
furniture
both
of
the
hall
and
house
were
sombre
and
handsome--truss-beams
corbels
girders
and
panels
were
of
the
blackest
oak
and
the
general
effect
of
all
this
augmented
if
anything
by
the
windows
which
were
too
high
and
narrow
to
admit
of
much
light
was
much
the
same
as
that
produced
by
the
interior
of
a
subterranean
chapel
or
charnel
house
from
the
hall
proceeded
doorways
and
passages
more
than
my
memory
can
now
particularize
of
these
portals
one
at
each
end
conducted
to
the
tower
stairs
others
to
reception
rooms
and
domestic
offices
the
whole
of
the
house
being
too
large
for
us
only
one
wing--the
right
and
newer
of
the
two--was
occupied
the
other
was
unfurnished
and
generally
shut
up
i
say
generally
because
there
were
times
when
either
my
mother
or
father--the
servants
never
ventured
there--forgot
to
lock
the
doors
and
the
handles
yielding
to
my
daring
fingers
i
surreptitiously
crept
in
everywhere--even
in
daylight
even
on
the
sunniest
of
mornings--were
dark
shadows
that
hung
around
the
ingles
and
recesses
of
the
rooms
the
deep
cupboards
the
passages
and
silent
winding
staircases
there
was
one
corridor--long
low
vaulted--where
these
shadows
assembled
in
particular
i
can
see
them
now
as
i
saw
them
then
as
they
have
come
to
me
many
times
in
my
dreams
grouped
about
the
doorways
flitting
to
and
fro
on
the
bare
dismal
boards
and
congregated
in
menacing
clusters
at
the
head
of
the
sepulchral
staircase
leading
to
the
cellars
generally
and
excepting
at
times
when
the
weather
was
particularly
violent
the
silence
here
was
so
emphatic
that
i
could
never
feel
it
was
altogether
natural
but
rather
that
it
was
assumed
especially
for
my
benefit--to
intimidate
me
if
i
moved
if
i
coughed
almost
if
i
breathed
the
whole
passage
was
filled
with
hoarse
reverberating
echoes
that
in
my
affrighted
ears
appeared
to
terminate
in
a
series
of
mirthless
malevolent
chuckles
once
when
fascinated
beyond
control
i
stole
on
tiptoe
along
the
passage
momentarily
expecting
a
door
to
fly
open
and
something
grim
and
horrible
to
pounce
out
on
me
i
was
brought
to
a
standstill
by
a
loud
clanging
noise
as
if
a
pail
or
some
such
utensil
were
set
down
very
roughly
on
a
stone
floor
then
there
was
the
sound
of
rushing
footsteps
and
of
someone
hastily
ascending
the
cellar
staircase
in
fearful
anticipation
as
to
what
i
should
see--for
there
was
something
in
the
sounds
that
told
me
they
were
not
made
by
anything
human--i
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
passage
and
stared
up
up
up
they
came
until
i
saw
the
dark
indefinite
shape
of
something
very
horrid
but
which
i
could
not--i
dare
not--define
it
was
accompanied
by
the
clanging
of
a
pail
i
tried
to
scream
but
my
tongue
cleaving
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
prevented
my
uttering
a
syllable
and
when
i
essayed
to
move
i
found
i
was
temporarily
paralysed
the
thing
came
rushing
down
on
me
i
grew
icy
cold
all
over
and
when
it
was
within
a
few
feet
of
me
my
horror
was
so
great
i
fainted
on
recovering
consciousness
it
was
some
minutes
before
i
summoned
up
courage
to
open
my
eyes
but
when
i
did
so
they
alighted
on
nothing
but
the
empty
passage--the
thing
had
disappeared
on
another
occasion
when
i
was
clandestinely
paying
a
visit
to
the
unused
wing
and
was
in
the
act
of
mounting
one
of
the
staircases
leading
from
the
corridor
i
have
just
described
to
the
first
floor
there
was
the
sound
of
a
furious
scuffle
overhead
and
something
dashed
down
the
stairs
past
me
i
instinctively
looked
up
and
there
glaring
down
at
me
from
over
the
balustrade
was
a
very
white
face
it
was
that
of
a
man
but
very
badly
proportioned--the
forehead
being
low
and
receding
and
the
rest
of
the
face
too
long
and
narrow
the
crown
rose
to
a
kind
of
peak
the
ears
were
pointed
and
set
very
low
down
and
far
back
the
mouth
was
very
cruel
and
thin-lipped
the
teeth
were
yellow
and
uneven
there
was
no
hair
on
the
face
but
that
on
the
head
was
red
and
matted
the
eyes
were
obliquely
set
pale
blue
and
full
of
an
expression
so
absolutely
malignant
that
every
atom
of
blood
in
my
veins
seemed
to
congeal
as
i
met
their
gaze
i
could
not
clearly
see
the
body
of
the
thing
as
it
was
hazy
and
indistinct
but
the
impression
i
got
of
it
was
that
it
was
clad
in
some
sort
of
tight-fitting
fantastic
garment
as
the
landing
was
in
semi-darkness
and
the
face
at
all
events
was
most
startlingly
visible
i
concluded
it
brought
with
it
a
light
of
its
own
though
there
was
none
of
that
lurid
glow
attached
to
it
which
i
subsequently
learned
is
almost
inseparable
from
spirit
phenomena
seen
under
similar
conditions
for
some
seconds
i
was
too
overcome
with
terror
to
move
but
my
faculties
at
length
reasserting
themselves
i
turned
round
and
flew
to
the
other
wing
of
the
house
with
the
utmost
precipitation
one
would
have
thought
that
after
these
experiences
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
have
run
the
risk
of
another
such
encounter
yet
only
a
few
days
after
the
incident
of
the
head
i
was
again
impelled
by
a
fascination
i
could
not
withstand
to
visit
the
same
quarters
in
sickly
anticipation
of
what
my
eyes
would
alight
on
i
stole
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
peeped
cautiously
up
to
my
infinite
joy
there
was
nothing
there
but
a
bright
patch
of
sunshine
that
in
the
most
unusual
fashion
had
forced
its
way
through
from
one
of
the
slits
of
windows
near
at
hand
after
gazing
at
it
long
enough
to
assure
myself
it
was
only
sunshine
i
quitted
the
spot
and
proceeded
on
my
way
down
the
vaulted
corridor
just
as
i
was
passing
one
of
the
doors
it
opened
i
stopped--terrified
what
could
it
be
bit
by
bit
inch
by
inch
i
watched
the
gap
slowly
widen
at
last
just
as
i
felt
i
must
either
go
mad
or
die
something
appeared--and
to
my
utter
astonishment
it
was
a
big
black
cat
limping
painfully
it
came
towards
me
with
a
curious
gliding
motion
and
i
perceived
with
a
thrill
of
horror
that
it
had
been
very
cruelly
maltreated
one
of
its
eyes
looked
as
if
it
had
been
gouged
out--its
ears
were
lacerated
whilst
the
paw
of
one
of
its
hind-legs
had
either
been
torn
or
hacked
off
as
i
drew
back
from
it
it
made
a
feeble
and
pathetic
effort
to
reach
me
and
rub
itself
against
my
legs
as
is
the
way
with
cats
but
in
so
doing
it
fell
down
and
uttering
a
half
purr
half
gurgle
vanished--seeming
to
sink
through
the
hard
oak
boards
that
evening
my
youngest
brother
met
with
an
accident
in
the
barn
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
died
though
i
did
not
then
associate
his
death
with
the
apparition
of
the
cat
the
latter
shocked
me
much
for
i
was
extremely
fond
of
animals
i
did
not
dare
venture
in
the
wing
again
for
nearly
two
years
when
next
i
did
so
it
was
early
one
june
morning--between
five
and
six
and
none
of
the
family
saving
my
father
who
was
out
in
the
fields
looking
after
his
men
were
as
yet
up
i
explored
the
dreaded
corridor
and
staircase
and
was
crossing
the
floor
of
one
of
the
rooms
i
had
hitherto
regarded
as
immune
from
ghostly
influences
when
there
was
an
icy
rush
of
wind
the
door
behind
me
slammed
to
violently
and
a
heavy
object
struck
me
with
great
force
in
the
hollow
of
my
back
with
a
cry
of
surprise
and
agony
i
turned
sharply
round
and
there
lying
on
the
floor
stretched
out
in
the
last
convulsions
of
death
was
the
big
black
cat
maimed
and
bleeding
as
it
had
been
on
the
previous
occasion
how
i
got
out
of
the
room
i
don't
recollect
i
was
too
horror-stricken
to
know
exactly
what
i
was
doing
but
i
distinctly
remember
that
as
i
tugged
the
door
open
there
was
a
low
gleeful
chuckle
and
something
slipped
by
me
and
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
corridor
at
noon
that
day
my
mother
had
a
seizure
of
apoplexy
and
died
at
midnight
again
there
was
a
lapse
of
years--this
time
nearly
four--when
sent
on
an
errand
for
my
father
i
turned
the
key
of
one
of
the
doors
leading
into
the
empty
wing
and
once
again
found
myself
within
the
haunted
precincts
all
was
just
as
it
had
been
on
the
occasion
of
my
last
visit--gloom
stillness
and
cobwebs
reigned
everywhere
whilst
permeating
the
atmosphere
was
a
feeling
of
intense
sadness
and
depression
i
did
what
was
required
of
me
as
quickly
as
possible
and
was
crossing
one
of
the
rooms
to
make
my
exit
when
a
dark
shadow
fell
athwart
the
threshold
of
the
door
and
i
saw
the
cat





that
evening
my
father
dropped
dead
as
he
was
hastening
home
through
the
fields
he
had
long
suffered
from
heart
disease
after
his
death
we--that
is
to
say
my
brother
sisters
and
self--were
obliged
to
leave
the
house
and
go
out
into
the
world
to
earn
our
living
we
never
went
there
again
and
never
heard
if
any
of
the
subsequent
tenants
experienced
similar
manifestations
this
is
as
nearly
as
i
can
recollect
mrs
hartnoll's
story
but
as
it
is
a
good
many
years
since
i
heard
it
there
is
just
a
possibility
of
some
of
the
details--the
smaller
ones
at
all
events--having
escaped
my
memory
when
i
was
grown
up
i
stayed
for
a
few
weeks
near
oxenby
and
met
at
a
garden
party
a
mr
and
mrs
wheeler
the
then
occupants
of
the
manor
house
i
asked
if
they
believed
in
ghosts
and
told
them
i
had
always
heard
their
house
was
haunted
well
they
said
we
never
believed
in
ghosts
till
we
came
to
oxenby
but
we
have
seen
and
heard
such
strange
things
since
we
have
been
in
the
manor
house
that
we
are
now
prepared
to
believe
anything
they
then
went
on
to
tell
me
that
they--and
many
of
their
visitors
and
servants--had
seen
the
phantasms
of
a
very
hideous
and
malignant
old
man
clad
in
tight-fitting
hosiery
of
mediã¦val
days
and
a
maimed
and
bleeding
big
black
cat
that
seemed
sometimes
to
drop
from
the
ceiling
and
sometimes
to
be
thrown
at
them
in
one
of
the
passages
all
sorts
of
queer
sounds
such
as
whinings
meanings
screeches
clangings
of
pails
and
rattlings
of
chains
were
heard
whilst
something
no
one
could
ever
see
distinctly
but
which
they
all
felt
to
be
indescribably
nasty
rushed
up
the
cellar
steps
and
flew
past
as
if
engaged
in
a
desperate
chase
indeed
the
disturbances
were
of
so
constant
and
harrowing
a
nature
that
the
wing
had
to
be
vacated
and
was
eventually
locked
up
the
wheelers
excavated
in
different
parts
of
the
haunted
wing
and
found
in
the
cellar
at
a
depth
of
some
eight
or
nine
feet
the
skeletons
of
three
men
and
two
women
whilst
in
the
wainscoting
of
the
passage
they
discovered
the
bones
of
a
boy
all
of
which
remains
they
had
properly
interred
in
the
churchyard
according
to
local
tradition
handed
down
through
many
centuries
by
word
of
mouth
the
house
originally
belonged
to
a
knight
who
with
his
wife
was
killed
out
hunting
he
had
only
one
child
a
boy
of
about
ten
who
became
a
ward
in
chancery
the
man
appointed
by
the
crown
as
guardian
to
this
child
proved
an
inhuman
monster
and
after
ill-treating
the
lad
in
every
conceivable
manner
eventually
murdered
him
and
tried
to
substitute
a
bastard
boy
of
his
own
in
his
place
for
a
time
the
fraud
succeeded
but
on
its
being
eventually
found
out
the
murderer
and
his
offspring
were
both
brought
to
trial
and
hanged
during
his
occupation
of
the
house
many
people
were
seen
to
enter
the
premises
but
never
leave
them
and
the
place
got
the
most
sinister
reputation
among
other
deeds
credited
to
the
murderer
and
his
offspring
was
the
mutilation
and
boiling
of
a
cat--the
particular
pet
of
the
young
heir
who
was
compelled
to
witness
the
whole
revolting
process
years
later
a
subsequent
owner
of
the
property
had
a
monument
erected
in
the
churchyard
to
the
memory
of
this
poor
abused
child
and
on
the
front
of
the
house
constructed
the
device
of
the
cat
though
it
is
impossible
to
determine
what
amount
of
truth
there
may
be
in
this
tradition
it
certainly
seems
to
accord
with
the
hauntings
and
to
supply
some
sort
of
explanation
to
them
the
ghostly
head
on
the
banisters
might
well
be
that
of
the
low
and
brutal
guardian
whose
spirit
would
be
the
exact
counterpart
of
his
mind
the
figure
seen
and
noises
heard
in
the
passage
point
to
the
re-enaction
of
some
tragedy
possibly
the
murder
of
the
heir
or
the
slaughter
of
his
cat
in
either
of
which
a
bucket
might
easily
have
played
a
grimly
significant
part
and
if
human
murderers
and
their
victims
have
phantasms
why
should
not
animals
have
phantasms
too
why
should
not
the
phenomenon
of
the
cat
seen
by
mrs
hartnoll
and
the
wheelers
have
been
the
actual
phantasm
of
an
earthbound
cat
no
amount
of
reasoning--religious
or
otherwise--has
as
yet
annihilated
the
possibility
of
all
forms
of
earthly
life

that
other
cat
one
evening
about
four
years
ago
i
was
in
my
drawing-room
with
two
friends
we
were
all
standing
up
on
the
point
of
going
to
bed
and
only
waiting
till
the
old
cook
had
succeeded
in
inducing
the
grey
persian
cat
to
come
in
for
the
night
this
was
sometimes
difficult
and
then
cook
came
up
as
on
this
occasion
and
called
him
from
the
balcony
and
the
french
window
was
wide
open
when
a
cat
rushed
in
at
the
window
and
through
the
door
what
was
that
we
said
looking
at
one
another
it
was
not
kitty
the
grey
persian
but
darker
and
was
it
really
a
cat
or
what
my
friend
rã¼gen
has
written
the
account
of
what
she
saw
before
seeing
what
i
have
said
iona
confirms
our
description
what
i
saw
seemed
dark
and
shadowy
and
yet
unmistakably
a
cat
it
seemed
to
me
like
the
predecessor
of
kitty
which
was
a
black
persian
he
had
the
same
habit
of
coming
in
at
night
by
this
window
and
he
constantly
rushed
through
the
room
and
downstairs
being
in
a
hurry
for
his
supper
a
moment
or
two
afterwards
the
grey
cat
walked
slowly
in
and
though
we
searched
the
house
we
could
find
no
other

when
cook
came
in
to
ask
for
kitty
a
silver-grey
persian
cat
to
settle
him
in
the
kitchen
for
the
night
kitty
was
still
in
the
garden
and
cook
went
to
the
balcony
calling
him
suddenly
i
saw
a
black
cat
flying
in
and
disappearing
behind
or
under
a
seat
first
i
did
not
take
much
notice
of
this
but
when
a
minute
after
kitty
slowly
and
solemnly
stepped
in
followed
by
cook
it
struck
me
that
the
dark
something
could
not
have
been
kitty

and
iona
made
the
remark
simultaneously
now
we
began
to
look
for
the
dark
one
all
over
the
place
without
any
result
cook
had
not
seen
any
cat
passing
her
on

what

what
kitty
saw
cook
said
i
wish
you
would
come
downstairs
and
see
how
strangely
kitty
behaves
as
soon
as
i
open
the
cupboard
there
is
nothing
in
it
but
the
wood
i
turned
it
all
out
to
see
what
might
be
the
reason--not
even
a
mousehole
can
i
find
some
days
previously
cook
had
told
me
that
nothing
could
induce
kitty
to
sleep
in
his
basket
and
one
day
he
would
not
eat
any
food
in
the
kitchen
and
his
meals
had
to
be
given
him
outside
so
i
went
down
to
please
cook
kitty
was
picked
up
and
while
cook
petted
and
stroked
him
she
knelt
down
and
opened
the
cupboard
kitty
stretching
his
neck
and
looking
with
big
frightened
eyes
into
the
cupboard's
corner
suddenly
turned
round
struggling
out
of
cook's
hold
and
rushing
over
her
shoulder
he
flew
out
of
the

up

said
that's
always
what
he
does
just
as
if
he
was
seeing
something
horrible

day

encouraged

to
talk
of

the
former

had
been
a
great
favourite

hers

which
she
had

nursing

when
he
was
ill
he
would
creep
into

i
put
him
in

making
it
very
comfortable

there
he

cat
my
son
had
the
following
experience
at
the
age
of
four
years
in
our
worcestershire
home
he
was
an
only
child
and
spent
much
of
his
time
in
the
company
of
a
cat
who
shared
his
tastes
and
pursuits
even
to
the
extent
of
fishing
in
the
river
weir
with
him
the
cat
being
far
more
proficient
at
the
sport
than
the
boy
when
the
cat
died
we
none
of
us
dared
to
break
the
news
to
the
child
and
were
much
surprised
when
he
asked
us
to
say
why
his
cat
only
came
to
play
with
him
at
nights
nowadays
when
we
questioned
him
about
it
he
stoutly
maintained
that
his
cat
was
there
in
bodily
form
every
night
after
he
went
to
bed
looking
much
the
same
but
a
little
thinner

about
the

evening

being
in

one
hour
i
heard
him
cry
out
and
going
upstairs
his
maid
also
heard
and
ran
up
and
asking
him
what
was
the
matter
he
said
that
an
old
gentleman
with
a
long
grey
beard
like
his
grandfather
came
into
his
room
and
stood
at
the
front
of
his
bed
at
the
very
moment
the
former
had
a
seizure
in
his
carriage
while
driving
through
the
streets
of

from
which
he
died
without
regaining
consciousness
later
on
he
recognized
a
photograph
of
his
grandfather
as
being
the
person
he
saw
at
the
foot
of
his
bed

statements

sufficiently
confident
about

english
to
attempt
to
put
down
anything
for

in
that
language
tells
me
the
following
story
for
the
occult
review--
when
i
was
a
little
girl
living
with
my
family
near
michelstadt
in
the
odenwald
i
remember
an
old
woman
like
an
old
witch
whose
name
was
louise
and
who
was
called
'pfeiffe
louise'
because
she
exhibited
pipes
for
sale
in
her
cottage
window
along
with
the
cheap
dress-stuffs
needles
and
threads
and
simple
toys
for
children
which
were
her
stock-in-trade
she
had
a
favourite
cat
which
was
devoted
to
her
but
its
attachment
doesn't
seem
to
have
been
enough
to
make
her
happy
for
she
married
a
young
sergeant
named
lautenschlager
who
might
have
been
her
son--or
indeed
her
grandson--and
who
as
everyone
said
courted
her
for
her
money
she
died
as
long
ago
as
1869
and
during
her
last
illness
the
devoted
cat
was
always
with
her
it
kept
watch
beside
the
body
when
she
was
dead
and
refused
to
be
driven
away
in
a
fit
of
exasperation
lautenschlager

at
a
place
where
the
road
from

to
the
neighbouring
village

runs
near

edge

was
bordered

after
his
first
wife
was
buried
lautenschlager
married
again
and
opened
an
eating-house
in
steinbach
where
he
established
his
second
wife
he
had
a
sister
whom
he
placed
in
the
cottage
of
poor
'pfeiffe
louise'
she
carried
on
the
business
and
every
day
lautenschlager
used
to
walk
over
from
steinbach
to
see
how
she
was
getting
on
returning
in
the
evening
to
his
wife
who
used
to
relate
to
my
mother
that
he
frequently
came
home
terrified
and
bathed
in
perspiration
for
as
he
passed
the
place
where
he
had
drowned
the
cat
its
ghost
used
to
come
out
of
the
river
and
run
beside
him
along
the
dark
road
sometimes
terrifying
him
still
more
by
jumping
in
front
of
him
after
a
few
years
of
married
life
the
second
wife
died
and
lautenschlager
married
a
third
the
little
cottage
business
had
prospered
and
in
its
place
he
now
had
a
considerable
draper's
shop
in
michelstadt
he
continued
to
walk
over
from
steinbach
where
now
the
third
wife
lived
in
the
eating-house
and
the
ghost
of
the
cat
continued
to
frighten
him
by
appearing
at
nightfall
as
he
walked
beside
the
river
i
can
remember
hearing
his
third
wife
describe
his
dread
of
it
and
my
mother
has
told
me
how
both
the
sister
and
the
second
wife
used
to
say
the
same
thing
though
i
was
too
young
then
for
them
to
tell
me
about
it
lautenschlager
used
also
to
complain
to
the
country
people
who
came
to
dine
at
his
eating-house
he
considered
himself
an
ill-used
man
and
felt
that
the
supernatural
powers
were
treating
him
very
hardly
and
subjecting
him
to
a
real
persecution
i
have
only
the
conversation
of
his
wife
and
the
gossip
of
the
village
to
vouch
for
his
sincerity
and
the
genuineness
of
the
apparition
is
supported
only
by
lautenschlager's
word
but
his
evident
anger
and
agitation
were
accepted
as
genuine
and
no
one
dreamed
of
doubting
his
word
he
was
not
at
all
a
dreamy
or
imaginative
man
and
did
not
drink
his
passion
was
merely
momentary
he
was
not
only
a
draper
and
caterer
but
a
usurer
and
realized
something
of
a
fortune
by
lending
money
on
good
security
to
peasants
and
farmers
who
it
was
said
did
not
consider
how
they
bound
themselves
when
they
signed
the
papers
he
put
before
them
lautenschlager
continued
to
be
haunted
by
the
cat-ghost
at
irregular
intervals
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
it
made
a
marked
change
in
his
character
he
became
serious
and
during
the
latter
part
of
his
life
would
only
talk
about
religion
and
read
sacred
literature
he
died
about
ten
years
ago

i

a

mrs

of

i
had
been
seated
only
a
few
minutes
when
a
little
pug-dog
of
hers
looked
up
in
the
direction
of
my

and
down
towards
my

growling
and
howling
in

oh

there
is
a

lying
across

one
half
of
his

is
quite
dark
and
the
other
half

has

also
a

the

had

to
pounce
upon
what
seemed
to
the

to
be
several

near
the
copper
in
the
scullery
of
the

the

asked
a
neighbour
if
the
previous
occupants
had
had
any
cats
oh
yes
replied
the
neighbour
and
badly
the

some

we
had
a

about
six
months

i
used
to

him
to
always
go
round
the

to

one

he

as

in

it

that
i

taught

he
must
not

because
he
would
go
a

then
turn
round
and
look
at

he
wanted
to

mrs

experience
a
spirit
purr
one
evening
in
february
1906
my
son
and
i
were
quietly
reading
in
full
gaslight
our
small
grey
cat
lying
on
the
sofa
a
short
distance
from
where
i
sat
suddenly
i
saw
on
my
knee
a
large
red
and
white
cat
which
belonged
to
us
in
india
which
was
a
very
dear
family
friend
and
as
fond
of
us
as
a
child
on
leaving
india
we
were
obliged
to
give
him
to
a
friend
and
in
the
end
he
shared
the
usual
fate
of
pets
in
that
country
making
a
meal
for
some
wild
animal
rufie-oofie
in
his
spirit
shape
purred
vigorously
rubbing
his
head
against
me
and
giving
every
sign
of
delight
at
seeing
us
again
i
did
not
speak
but
in
a
few
minutes
my
son
looked
up
and
said
mother
rufie-oofie
is
on
your
knee
when
the
spirit
cat
jumped
down
and
went
to
him
to
be
petted
then
he
returned
to
me
and
walked
along
the
sofa
to
where
our
present
cat
kim
was
asleep
the
spirit
cat
with
a
look
of
almost
human
fun
patted
kim's
head
the
latter
awaking
with
a
start
rufie-oofie
continued
to
make
playful
dabs
at
kim's
ears
kim
following
each
movement
with
glaring
eyes
distinctly
seeing
and
realizing
that
another
cat
was
invading
his
sofa
but
not
in
the
least
angry
with
him
and
quite
ready
to
play
after
a
few
minutes
the
spirit
cat
came
back
to
my
knee
whereupon
the
earth
cat
displayed
jealousy
which
rufie-oofie
resented
but
before
they
came
to
actual
words

sir
the
following
notes
of
psychological
experiences
with
animals
may
be
of
interest--
i
had
a
collie
who
lived
to
a
good
old
age
she
was
deaf
and
infirm
and
one
hind-leg
was
paralysed
so
that
it
dragged
as
she
walked
i
was
taken
ill
not
seriously
nor
so
as
in
any
way
to
affect
my
brain
but
as
my
poor
old
dog
would
insist
on
coming
and
lying
in
my
room
the
doctor
insisted
on
her
being
destroyed
i
felt
that
her
life
was
no
pleasure
to
her
and
she
was
killed
with
chloroform
three
days
afterwards
in
the
afternoon
i
heard
her
come
upstairs
with
her
dragging
hind-leg
i
heard
her
steps
come
along
the
long
passage
which
had
my
room
at
the
end
and
lost
them
about
half-way
up
on
the
third
day
i
called
her
and
spoke
to
her
putting
out
my
hand
as
if
she
would
come
and
put
her
head
under
it
and
told
her
all
was
right
i
never
heard
her
any
more
i
believe
that
on
one
occasion
she
told
me
by
thought
transference
that
she
had
no
water
in
her
pan
the
pan
was
always
filled
and
i
knew
that
she
wanted
something
but
thought
of
all
other
wants
but
water
she
made
her
eyes
protrude
and
looked
at
me
intently
and
water
flashed
into
my
mind
i
looked
and
found
the
pan
empty
it
is
of
course
possible
that
the
suggestion
came
from
my
own
subconscious
mind
i
never
saw
the
aura
of
a
human
being
but
i
once
had
a
kind
of
vision
of
this
dog
which
experts
have
told
me
was
her
aura
i
was
sitting
by
the
fire
somewhat
somnolent
and
he
was
lying
on
the
hearthrug
all
at
once
his
golden
brown
coat
disappeared
and
i
saw
a
mass
of
reddish
brown
or
perhaps
i
should
say
brownish
red
and
on
one
side
of
it
was
an
irregular
patch
of
fleecy
white
bordered
with
sapphire
blue
i
was
told
that
the
brownish
red
represented
the
dog's
animal
instincts
the
pearly
white
his
animal
innocence
and
the
sapphire
blue
his
devotional
instinct
in
his
case
directed
to
me
as
his
deity
whether
any
of
your
readers
have
had
similar
experiences
and
explain
them
similarly
i
do
not
know
i
had
to
go
abroad
one
summer
and
my
dog
was
ill
with
eczema
and
as
i
did
not
very
much
trust
the
maid
i
was
leaving
in
charge
i
sent
him
to
the
vet's
to
be
treated
as
soon
as
i
reached
my
destination
i
wrote
to
a
friend
to
go
and
inquire
how
he
was
she
replied
that
the
dog
was
perfectly
miserable
and
that
he
had
an
enormous
wound
on
his
back
that
he
had
eaten
nothing
for
a
week
that
he
was
too
weak
to
stand
and
that
if
he
were
hers
she
would
have
him
put
out
of
his
misery
at
once
i
wrote
at
once
to
the
vet
telling
him
to
telegraph
curable
or
hopeless
and
to
act
accordingly
meanwhile
i
sat
that
afternoon
in
the
bã¼rgerpark
by
myself
and
imagined
the
dog
upon
my
lap
and
myself
stroking
and
healing
him
after
this
i
found
myself
fully
believing
that
he
would
get
better
the
telegram
i
received
was
curable
and
my
friend
wrote
a
second
letter
and
said
it
was
a
miracle
for
the
dog
was
quite
convalescent
he
recovered
perfectly
here
again
however
it
may
have
been
that
he
was
breaking
his
heart
for
a
friend
and
that
my
friend's
visit
cheered
him
or
may
not
both
causes
have
had
their
effect

here
is
another
case
in
the
veracity
of
which
i

when
we--my

no
possibility
of
the
place
being
haunted
crossed
our
minds
indeed
ghosts
were
the
very
last
things
we
reckoned
on
as
neither
of
us
had
the
slightest
belief
in
them
like
the
generality
of
solicitors
i
am
stodgy
and
unimaginative
whilst
my
wife
is
the
most
practical
and
matter-of-fact
little
woman
you
would
meet
in
a
day's
march
nor
was
there
anything
about
the
house
that
in
any
way
suggested
the
superphysical
it
was
airy
and
light--no
dark
corners
nor
sinister
staircases--and
equipped
throughout
with
all
modern
conveniences
we
began
our
lease
in
june--the
hottest
june
i
remember--and
nothing
occurred
to
disturb
us
till
october
it
happened
then
in
this
wise
i
will
quote
from
my
diary--
monday
october
11th--dick--that
is
my
brother-in-law--and
i
at
11
pm
were
sitting
smoking
and
chatting
together
in
the
study
all
the
rest
of
the
household
had
gone
to
bed
we
had
no
light
in
the
room--as
dick
had
a
headache--save
the
fire
and
that
had
burned
so
low
that
its
feeble
glimmering
scarcely
enabled
us
to
see
each
other's
face
after
a
space
of
sudden
and
thoughtful
silence
dick
took
the
stump
of
a
cigar
from
his
lips
and
threw
it
in
the
grate
where
for
a
few
moments
it
lay
glowing
in
the
gloom
'jack'
he
said
'you
will
think
me
mad
but
there
is
something
deuced
queer
about
this
room
to-night--something
in
the
atmosphere
i
cannot
define
but
which
i
have
never
felt
here--or
indeed
anywhere--before
look
at
that
cigar-end--look'
i
did
so
and
received
a
shock
what
i
saw
was
certainly
not
the
stump
dick
had
had
in
his
mouth
but
an
eye--a
large
red
and
lurid
eye--that
looked
up
at
us
with
an
expression
of
the
utmost
hate
dick
raised
the
shovel
and
struck
at
it
but
without
effect--it
still
glared
at
us
a
great
horror
then
seized
us
and
unable
to
remove
our
gaze
from
the
hellish
thing
we
sat
glued
to
our
chairs
staring
at
it
this
state
of
affairs
lasted
till
the
clock
in
the
hall
outside
struck
twelve
when
the
eye
suddenly
vanished
and
we
both
felt
as
if
some
intensely
evil
influence
had
been
suddenly
removed
dick
did
not
like
the
idea
of
sleeping
alone
and
asked
if
he
might
keep
the
electric
light
on
in
his
room
all
night
tremendous
extravagance
but
under
the
circumstances
excusable
i
confess
i
devoutly
wished
it
was
morning
tuesday
october
12th--i
was
awakened
at
1130
pm
by
delia
saying
to
me
'oh
edward
there
have
been
such
dreadful
noises
on
the
landing
just
as
if
a
cat
were
being
worried
to
death
by
dogs
hark
there
it
is
again'
and
as
she
spoke
from
apparently
just
outside
the
door
came
a
series
of
loud
screeches
accompanied
by
savage
growls
and
snarls
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
it
as
we
had
no
animals
of
our
own
in
the
house
but
concluding
that
a
door
or
window
having
been
left
open
a
dog
and
cat
had
got
in
from
outside
i
lit
a
candle
and
opened
the
bedroom
door
instantly
the
sounds
ceased
and
there
was
dead
silence
and
although
i
searched
everywhere
not
a
vestige
of
any
animal
was
to
be
seen
moreover
all
the
doors
leading
into
the
garden
were
shut
and
locked
and
the
windows
closed
not
wishing
to
frighten
delia
i
laughingly
assured
her
the
cat--a
black
tom--was
all
right
that
it
was
sitting
on
the
roof
of
the
summer-house
looking
none
the
worse
for
its
treatment
and
that
i
had
sent
the
dog--a
terrier--flying
out
of
the
gate
with
a
well-deserved
kick
i
explained
it
was
my
fault
about
the
front
door
being
left
open--my
brain
had
been
a
bit
overstrained
through
excessive
work--and
asked
her
on
no
account
to
blame
the
servants
i
grow
alarmed
at
times
when
i
realize
how
easy
lawyering
makes
lying
friday
october
21st--on
my
way
to
bed
last
night
i
encountered
a
rush
of
icy
cold
air
at
the
first
bend
of
the
staircase
the
candle
flared
up
a
bright
blue
flame
and
went
out
something--an
animal
of
sorts--came
tearing
down
the
stairs
past
me
and
on
peering
over
the
banisters
i
saw
looking
up
at
me
from
the
well
of
darkness
beneath
two
big
red
eyes
the
counterparts
of
the
one
dick
and
i
had
seen
on
october
11th
i
threw
a
matchbox
at
them
but
without
effect
it
was
only
when
i
switched
on
the
electric
light
that
they
disappeared
i
searched
the
house
most
carefully
but
there
were
no
signs
of
any
animal
joined
delia
feeling
nervous
and
henpecky
monday
november
7th--tom
and
mable
came
running
into
delia's
room
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
after
tea
to-day
'mother'
they
cried
'mother
do
come
some
horrid
dog
has
got
a
cat
in
the
spare
room
and
is
tearing
it
to
pieces'
delia
who
was
mending
my
socks
at
the
time
flung
them
anywhere
and
springing
to
her
feet
flew
to
the
spare
room
the
door
was
shut
but
proceeding
from
within
was
the
most
appalling
pandemonium
of
screeches
and
snarls
just
as
if
some
dog
had
got
hold
of
a
cat
by
the
neck
and
was
shaking
it
to
death
delia
swung
open
the
door
and
rushed
in
the
room
was
empty--not
a
trace
of
a
cat
or
dog
anywhere--and
the
sounds
ceased
on
my
return
home
delia
met
me
in
the
garden
'jack'
she
said
'i
have
probed
the
mystery
at
last
the
house
is
haunted
we
must
leave'
saturday
november
12th--sublet
house
to
james
barstow
retired
oil
merchant
to-day
he
comes
in
on
the

he'll
like
it
tuesday
november
15th--cook
left
to-day
'i've
no
fault
to
find
with
you
mum'
she
condescendingly
explained
to
delia
'it's
not
you
nor
the
children
nor
the
food
it's
the
noises
at
night--screeches
outside
my
door
which
sound
like
a
cat
but
which
i
know
can't
be
a
cat
as
there
is
no
cat
in
the
house
this
morning
mum
shortly
after
the
clock
struck
two
things
came
to
a
climax
hearing
something
in
the
corner
and
wondering
if
it
was
a
mouse--i
ain't
a
bit
afraid
of
mice
mum--i
sat
up
in
bed
and
was
getting
ready
to
strike
a
light--the
matchbox
was
in
my
hand--when
something
heavy
sprang
right
on
the
top
of
me
and
gave
a
loud
growl
in
my
ear
that
finished
me
mum--i
fainted
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
too
frightened
to
stir
but
lay
with
my
head
under
the
blankets
till
it
was
time
to
get
up
i
then
searched
everywhere
but
there
was
no
sign
of
any
dog
and
as
the
door
was
locked
there
was
no
possibility
of
any
dog
having
got
in
during
the
night
mum
i
wouldn't
go
through
what
i
suffered
again
for
fifty
pounds
i've
got
palpitations
even
now
and
i
would
rather
go
without
my
month's
wages
than
sleep
in
that
room
another
night'
delia
paid
her
up
to
date
and
she
went
directly
after
tea
friday
november
18th--as
i
was
coming
out
of
the
bathroom
at
11
pm
something
fell
into
the
bath
with
a
loud
splash
i
turned
to
see
what
it
was--there
was
nothing
there
i
ran
up
the
stairs
to
bed
three
steps
at
a
time
sunday
november
20th--went
to
church
in
the
morning
and
heard
the
usual
oxford
drawl
on
the
way
back
i
was
pondering
over
the
sermon
and
wishing
i
could
contort
the
law
as
successfully
as
parsons
contort
the
scriptures
when
dot--she
is
six
to-day--came
running
up
to
me
with
a
very
scared
expression
in
her
eyes
'father'
she
cried
plucking
me
by
the
sleeve
'do
hurry
up
mother
is
very
ill'
full
of
dreadful
anticipations
i
tore
home
and
on
arriving
found
delia
lying
on
the
sofa
in
a
violent
fit
of
hysterics
it
was
fully
an
hour
before
she
recovered
sufficiently
to
tell
me
what
had
happened
her
account
runs
thus--
'after
you
went
to
church'
she
began
'i
made
the
custard
pudding
jelly
and
blancmange
for
dinner
heard
the
children
their
collects
and
had
just
sat
down
with
the
intention
of
writing
a
letter
to
mother
when
i
heard
a
very
pathetic
mew
coming
so
i
thought
from
under
the
sofa
thinking
it
was
some
stray
cat
that
had
got
in
through
one
of
the
windows
i
tried
to
entice
it
out
by
calling
puss
puss
and
making
the
usual
silly
noise
people
do
on
such
occasions
no
cat
coming
out
and
the
mewing
still
continuing
i
knelt
down
and
peered
under
the
sofa
there
was
no
cat
there
had
it
been
night
i
should
have
been
very
much
afraid
but
i
could
scarcely
reconcile
myself
to
the
idea
of
ghosts
with
the
room
filled
with
sunshine
resuming
my
seat
i
went
on
with
my
writing
but
not
for
long
the
mewing
grew
nearer
i
distinctly
heard
something
crawl
out
from
under
the
sofa
there
was
then
a
pause
during
which
you
could
have
heard
the
proverbial
pin
fall
and
then
something
sprang
upon
me
and
dug
its
claws
in
my
knees
i
looked
down
and
to
my
horror
and
distress
perceived
standing
on
its
hind-legs
pawing
my
clothes
a
large
tabby
cat
without
a
head--the
neck
terminating
in
a
mangled
stump
the
sight
so
appalled
me
that
i
don't
know
what
happened
but
nurse
and
the
children
came
in
and
found
me
lying
on
the
floor
in
hysterics
can't
we
leave
the
house
at
once'
wednesday
november
30th--left
no
----
lower
seedley
road
at
2
pm
had
an
awful
scurry
to
get
things
packed
in
time
and
dread
opening
certain
of
the
packing-cases
lest
we
shall
find
all
the
crockery
smashed
just
as
we
were
starting
delia
cried
out
that
she
had
left
her
reticule
behind
and
i
was
despatched
in
search
of
it
i
searched
everywhere--till
i
was
worn
out
for
i
know
what
delia
is--and
was
leaving
the
premises
in
full
anticipation
of
being
sent
back
again
when
there
was
a
loud
commotion
in
the
hall
just
as
if
a
dog
had
suddenly
pounced
on
a
cat
and
the
next
moment
a
large
tabby
with
the
head
hewn
away
as
delia
had
described
rushed
up
to
me
and
tried
to
spring
on
to
my
shoulders
at
this
juncture
one
of
the
servants
cautiously
opened
the
hall
door
from
without
and
informed
me
i
was
wanted
the
cat
instantly
vanished
and
on
my
reaching
the
carriage
in
a
state
of
breathless
haste
and
trepidation
delia
told
me
she
had
found
her
reticule--she
had
been
sitting
on
it
all
the
time
in
a
subsequent
note
in
his
diary
a
year
or
so
later
mr
dane
says
after
innumerable
enquiries
re
the
history
of
no
----
lower
seedley
road
prior
to
our
inhabiting
it
i
have
at
length
elicited
the
fact
that
twelve
years
ago
a
mr
and
mrs
barlowe
lived
there
they
had
one
son
arthur
whom
they
spoilt
in
the
most
outrageous
fashion
even
to
the
extent
of
encouraging
him
in
acts
of
cruelty
to
afford
him
amusement
they
used
to
buy
rats
for
his
dog--a
fox-terrier--to
worry
and
on
one
occasion
procured
a
stray
cat
which
the
servants
afterwards
declared
was
mangled
in
the
most
shocking
manner
before
being
finally
destroyed
by
arthur
here
then
in
my
opinion
is
a
very
feasible
explanation
for
the
hauntings--the
phenomenon
seen
was
the
phantasm
of
the
poor
tortured
cat
for
if
human
tragedies
are
re-enacted
by
ghosts
why
not
animal
tragedies
too
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
man
has
the
monopoly
of
soul
or
spirit
the
cat
on
the
post
in
her
ghosts
and
family
legends
mrs
crowe
narrates
the
following
case
of
a
haunting
by
the
phantom
of
a
cat--
after
the
doctor's
story
i
fear
mine
will
appear
too
trifling
said
mrs
m
but
as
it
is
the
only
circumstance
of
the
kind
that
ever
happened
to
myself
i
prefer
giving
it
you
to
any
of
the
many
stories
i
have
heard
about
fifteen
years
ago
i
was
staying
with
some
friends
at
a
magnificent
old
seat
in
yorkshire
and
our
host
being
very
much
crippled
with
the
gout
was
in
the
habit
of
driving
about
the
park
and
neighbourhood
in
a
low
pony
phaeton
on
which
occasions
i
often
accompanied
him
one
of
our
favourite
excursions
was
to
the
ruins
of
an
old
abbey
just
beyond
the
park
and
we
generally
returned
by
a
remarkably
pretty
rural
lane
leading
to
the
village
or
rather
small
town
of
c----
one
fine
summer's
evening
we
had
just
entered
this
lane
when
seeing
the
hedges
full
of
wild
flowers
i
asked
my
friend
to
let
me
alight
and
gather
some
i
walked
before
the
carriage
picking
honeysuckles
and
roses
as
i
went
along
till
i
came
to
a
gate
that
led
into
a
field
it
was
a
common
country
gate
with
a
post
on
each
side
and
on
one
of
these
posts
sat
a
large
white
cat
the
finest
animal
of
the
kind
i
had
ever
seen
and
as
i
have
a
weakness
for
cats
i
stopped
to
admire
this
sleek
fat
puss
looking
so
wonderfully
comfortable
in
a
very
uncomfortable
position
the
top
of
the
post
on
which
it
was
sitting
with
its
feet
doubled
up
under
it
being
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
body
for
no
angola
ever
rivalled
it
in
size
'come
on
gently'
i
called
to
my
friend
'here's
such
a
magnificent
cat'
for
i
feared
the
approach
of
the
phaeton
would
startle
it
away
before
he
had
seen
it
'where'
said
he
pulling
up
his
horse
opposite
the
gate
'there'
said
i
pointing
to
the
post
'isn't
he
a
beauty
i
wonder
if
it
would
let
me
stroke
it'
'i
see
no
cat'
said
he
'there
on
the
post'
said
i
but
he
declared
he
saw
nothing
though
puss
sat
there
in
perfect
composure
during
this
colloquy
'don't
you
see
the
cat
james'
said
i
in
great
perplexity
to
the
groom
'yes
ma'am
a
large
white
cat
on
that
post'
i
thought
my
friend
must
be
joking
or
losing
his
eyesight
and
i
approached
the
cat
intending
to
take
it
in
my
arms
and
carry
it
to
the
carriage
but
as
i
drew
near
she
jumped
off
the
post
which
was
natural
enough
but
to
my
surprise
she
jumped
into
nothing--as
she
jumped
she
disappeared
no
cat
in
the
field--none
in
the
lane--none
in
the
ditch
'where
did
she
go
james'
'i
don't
know
ma'am
i
can't
see
her'
said
the
groom
standing
up
in
his
seat
and
looking
all
round
i
was
quite
bewildered
but
still
i
had
no
glimmering
of
the
truth
and
when
i
got
into
the
carriage
again
my
friend
said
he
thought
i
and
james
were
dreaming
and
i
retorted
that
i
thought
he
must
be
going
blind
i
had
a
commission
to
execute
as
we
passed
through
the
town
and
i
alighted
for
that
purpose
at
the
little
haberdasher's
and
while
they
were
serving
me
i
mentioned
that
i
had
seen
a
remarkably
beautiful
cat
sitting
on
a
gate
in
the
lane
and
asked
if
they
could
tell
me
who
it
belonged
to
adding
it
was
the
largest
cat
i
ever
saw
the
owners
of
the
shop
and
two
women
who
were
making
purchases
suspended
their
proceedings
looked
at
each
other
and
then
looked
at
me
evidently
very
much
surprised
'was
it
a
white
cat
ma'am'
said
the
mistress
'yes
a
white
cat
a
beautiful
creature
and----'
'bless
me'
cried
two
or
three
'the
lady's
seen
the
white
cat
of
c----
it
hasn't
been
seen
these
twenty
years'
'master
wishes
to
know
if
you'll
soon
be
done
ma'am
the
pony
is
getting
restless'
said
james
of
course
i
hurried
out
and
got
into
the
carriage
telling
my
friend
that
the
cat
was
well
known
to
the
people
at
c----
and
that
it
was
twenty
years
old
in
those
days
i
believe
i
never
thought
of
ghosts
and
least
of
all
should
have
thought
of
the
ghost
of
a
cat
but
two
evenings
afterwards
as
we
were
driving
down
the
lane
i
again
saw
the
cat
in
the
same
position
and
again
my
companion
could
not
see
it
though
the
groom
did
i
alighted
immediately
and
went
up
to
it
as
i
approached
it
turned
its
head
and
looked
full
towards
me
with
its
soft
mild
eyes
and
a
friendly
expression
like
that
of
a
loving
dog
and
then
without
moving
from
the
post
it
began
to
fade
gradually
away
as
if
it
were
a
vapour
till
it
had
quite
disappeared
all
this
the
groom
saw
as
well
as
myself
and
now
there
could
be
no
mistake
as
to
what
it
was
a
third
time
i
saw
it
in
broad
daylight
and
my
curiosity
greatly
awakened
i
resolved
to
make
further
enquiries
amongst
the
inhabitants
of
c----
but
before
i
had
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
i
was
summoned
away
by
the
death
of
my
eldest
child
and
i
have
never
been
in
that
part
of
the
world
since
however
i
once
mentioned
the
circumstance
to
a
lady
who
was
acquainted
with
that
neighbourhood
and
she
said
she
had
heard
of
the
white
cat
of
c----
but
had
never
seen
it
this
is
mrs
m's
account
as
related
by
mrs
crowe
and
after
perusing
the
authoress's
preface
to
the
work
i
am
inclined
to
give
it
full
credence
the
mystic
properties
of
cats
the
most
common
forms
of
animal
phenomena
seen
in
haunted
houses
are
undoubtedly
those
of
cats
the
number
of
places
reported
to
me
as
being
haunted
by
cats
is
almost
incredible--in
one
street
in
whitechapel
there
are
no
less
than
four
this
state
of
affairs
may
possibly
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
cats
more
than
any
other
animals
that
live
in
houses
meet
with
sudden
and
unnatural
ends
especially
in
the
poorer
districts
where
the
doctrine
of
kindness
to
animals
has
not
as
yet
made
itself
thoroughly
felt
now
i
am
touching
on
the
subject
of
cat
ghosts
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
reproduce
the
following
article
of
mine
entitled
cats
and
the
unknown
which
appeared
in
the
occult
review
for
december
1912--
since
from
all
ages
the
cat
has
been
closely
associated
with
the
supernatural
it
is
not
surprising
to
learn
that
images
and
symbols
of
that
animal
figured
in
the
temples
of
the
sun
and
moon
respectively
in
ancient
egypt
according
to
horapollo
the
cat
was
worshipped
in
the
temple
of
heliopolis
sacred
to
the
sun
because
the
size
of
the
pupil
of
the
cat's
eye
is
regulated
by
the
height
of
the
sun
above
the
horizon
other
authorities
suggest
a
rather
more
subtle--and
in
my
opinion
more
probable--reason
namely
that
the
link
between
the
sun
and
the
cat
is
not
merely
physical
but
superphysical
that
the
cat
is
attracted
to
the
sun
not
only
because
it
loves
warmth
but
because
the
sun
keeps
off
terrifying
and
antagonistic
occult
forces
to
the
influences
of
which
the
cat
above
all
other
animals
is
specially
susceptible
a
fact
fully
recognized
by
the
egyptians
who
to
show
their
understanding
and
appreciation
of
this
feline
attachment
took
care
that
whenever
a
temple
was
dedicated
to
the
sun
an
image
or
symbol
of
the
cat
was
placed
somewhere
well
in
evidence
within
the
precincts
to
make
this
theory
all
the
more
probable
images
and
symbols
of
the
cat
were
dedicated
to
the
moon
the
moon
being
universally
regarded
as
the
quintessence
of
everything
supernatural
the
very
cockpit
in
fact
of
mystery
and
spookism
the
nocturnal
habits
of
the
cat
its
love
of
prowling
about
during
moonlight
hours
and
the
spectacle
of
its
two
round
gleaming
eyes
may
of
course
as
plutarch
seems
to
have
thought
have
suggested
to
the
egyptians
human
influence
and
analogy
and
thus
the
presence
of
its
effigy
in
temples
to
isis
would
be
partially
at
all
events
accounted
for
though
as
before
i
am
inclined
to
think
there
is
another
and
rather
more
subtle
reason
from
endless
experiments
made
in
haunted
houses
i
have
proved
to
my
own
satisfaction
at
least
that
the
cat
acts
as
a
thoroughly
reliable
psychic
barometer
the
dog
is
sometimes
unaware
of
the
proximity
of
the
unknown
when
the
ghost
materializes
or
in
some
other
way
demonstrates
its
advent
the
dog
occasionally
is
wholly
undisturbed--the
cat
never
i
have
never
yet
had
a
cat
with
me
that
has
not
shown
the
most
obvious
signs
of
terror
and
uneasiness
both
before
and
during
a
superphysical
manifestation
now
although
i
won't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
ghostly
demonstrations
are
actually
dependent
on
the
moon--that
they
occur
only
on
nights
when
the
moon
is
visible--experience
has
led
me
to
believe
that
the
moon
most
certainly
does
influence
them--that
moonlight
nights
are
much
more
favourable
to
ghostly
appearances
than
other
nights
hence--there
is
this
much
in
common
between
the
moon
and
cats--the
one
influences
and
the
other
is
influenced
by
psychic
phenomena--a
fact
that
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
be
recognized
by
so
keen
observers
of
the
occult
as
the
ancient
egyptians
the
presence
of
the
cat's
effigy
in
the
temples
of
isis
might
thus
be
explained
over
and
over
again
we
come
across
the
cat
in
the
land
of
the
pharaohs
it
seems
to
be
inseparable
from
the
esoteric
side
of
egyptian
life
the
goddess
bast
is
depicted
with
a
cat's
head
holding
the
sistrum
ie
the
symbol
of
the
world's
harmony
in
her
hand
one
of
the
most
ancient
symbols
of
the
cat
is
to
be
found
in
the
necropolis
of
thebes
which
contains
the
tomb
of
hana
who
probably
belonged
to
the
eleventh
dynasty
there
hana
is
depicted
standing
erect
proud
and
kingly
with
his
favourite
cat
borehaki--borehaki
the
picture
of
all
things
strange
and
psychic
and
from
whom
one
cannot
help
supposing
he
may
have
chosen
his
occult
inspiration--at
his
feet
so
sure
were
the
egyptians
that
the
cat
possessed
a
soul
that
they
deemed
it
worthy
of
the
same
funeral
rites
they
bestowed
on
man
cats
were
embalmed
and
innumerable
cat
mummies
have
been
discovered
in
wooden
coffins
at
bubastis
speos
artemidos
and
thebes
when
a
cat
died
the
egyptians
shaved
their
eyebrows
not
only
to
show
grief
at
the
loss
of
their
loved
one
but
to
avert
subsequent
misfortune
so
long
as
a
cat
was
in
his
house
the
egyptian
felt
safe
from
inimical
supernatural
influences
but
if
there
was
no
cat
in
the
house
at
night
then
any
undesirable
from
the
occult
world
might
visit
him
indeed
in
such
high
esteem
did
the
egyptians
hold
the
cat
that
they
voluntarily
incurred
the
gravest
risks
when
its
life
was
in
peril
no
one
of
them
appreciated
the
cat
and
set
a
higher
value
on
its
mystic
properties
than
the
sultan
el-daher-beybas
who
reigned
in
ad
1260
and
has
been
compared
with
william
of
tripoli
for
his
courage
and
with
nero
for
his
cruelty
el-daher-beybas
kept
his
palace
swarming
with
cats
and--if
we
may
give
credence
to
tradition--was
seldom
to
be
seen
unaccompanied
by
one
of
these
animals
when
he
died
he
left
the
proceeds
from
the
product
of
a
garden
to
support
his
feline
friends--an
example
that
found
many
subsequent
imitators
indeed
until
comparatively
recently
in
cairo
cats
were
regularly
fed
between
noon
and
sunset
in
the
outer
court
of
the
mehkemeh
in
geneva
rome
and
constantinople
though
cats
were
generally
deemed
to
have
souls
and
to
possess
psychic
properties
they
were
thought
to
derive
them
from
evil
sources
and
so
strong
was
the
prejudice
against
these
unfortunate
animals
on
this
account
that
all
through
the
middle
ages
we
find
them
suffering
such
barbaric
torture
as
only
the
perverted
minds
of
a
fanatical
priest-ridden
people
could
devise
which
treatment
no
doubt
partly
at
all
events
accounts
for
the
many
palaces
houses
etc
in
those
particular
countries
stated
to
have
been
haunted
by
the
spirits
of
cats
the
devil
was
popularly
supposed
to
appear
in
the
shape
of
a
black
tom
in
preference
to
assuming
any
other
guise
and
the
bare
fact
of
an
old
woman
being
seen
once
or
twice
with
a
black
cat
by
her
side
was
quite
sufficient
to
earn
for
her
the
reputation
of
a
witch
it
would
be
idle
of
course
to
expect
people
in
these
unmeditative
times
to
believe
there
was
ever
the
remotest
truth
underlying
these
so-called
phantastic
suppositions
of
the
past
yet
according
to
reliable
testimony
there
are
at
the
present
moment
many
houses
in
england
haunted
by
phantasms
in
the
form
of
black
cats
of
so
sinister
and
hostile
an
appearance
that
one
can
only
assume
that
unless
they
are
the
actual
spirits
of
cats
earthbound
through
cruel
and
vicious
propensities
they
must
be
vice-elementals
ie
spirits
that
have
never
inhabited
any
material
body
and
which
have
either
been
generated
by
vicious
thoughts
or
else
have
been
attracted
elsewhere
to
a
spot
by
some
crime
or
vicious
act
once
perpetrated
there
vice-elemental
is
merely
the
modern
name
for
fiend
or
demon
apart
from
his
luciferan
qualities
the
cat
was
awarded
all
sorts
of
other
qualities
not
the
least
important
of
which
was
its
prophetic
capability
if
a
cat
washed
its
face
rainy
weather
was
regarded
as
inevitable
if
a
cat
frolicked
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
it
was
a
sure
sign
of
a
storm
whilst
if
a
live
ember
fell
on
a
cat
an
earthquake
shock
would
speedily
be
felt
cats
too
were
reputed
the
harbingers
of
good
and
bad
fortune
not
a
person
in
normandy
but
believed
at
one
time
that
the
spectacle
of
a
tortoiseshell
cat
climbing
a
tree
foretold
death
from
accident
and
that
a
black
cat
crossing
one's
path
in
the
moonlight
presaged
death
from
an
epidemic
two
black
cats
viewed
in
the
open
between
4
and
7
am
were
generally
believed
to
predict
a
death
whereas
a
strange
white
cat
heard
mewing
on
a
doorstep
was
loudly
welcomed
as
the
indication
of
an
approaching
marriage
according
to
tradition
one
learns
that
cats
were
occasionally
made
use
of
in
medicine
to
cure
peasants
of
skin
diseases
french
sorcerers
sprinkling
the
afflicted
parts
with
three
drops
of
blood
drawn
from
the
vein
under
a
cat's
tail
whilst
blindness
was
treated
by
blowing
into
the
patient's
eyes
three
times
a
day
the
dust
made
from
ashes
of
the
head
of
a
black
cat
that
had
been
burned
alive
talking
of
burning
cats
reminds
me
of
a
horrible
practice
that
was
prevalent
in
the
hebrides
as
late
as
1750
it
was
firmly
believed
there
that
cats
were
extraordinarily
psychic
and
that
a
sure
means
of
getting
in
close
touch
with
occult
powers
and
of
obtaining
from
them
the
faculty
of
second
sight--such
as
the
cat
possessed--was
to
offer
up
as
sacrifices
innumerable
black
cats
the
process
was
very
simple
a
black
cat
was
fastened
to
a
spit
before
a
slow
fire
and
as
soon
as
the
wretched
animal
was
well
roasted
another
took
its
place
victims
being
supplied
without
intermission
until
their
vociferous
screams
brought
to
the
scene
a
number
of
ghostly
cats
who
joined
in
the
chorus
the
desired
climax
was
reached
when
an
enormous
phantom
cat
suddenly
appeared
and
informed
the
operator
that
it
was
willing
to
grant
him
any
one
request
if
he
would
only
refrain
from
his
cruel
persecution
the
operator
at
once
demanded
the
faculty
of
second
sight--a
power
more
highly
prized
in
the
hebrides
than
any
other--and
the
moment
it
was
bestowed
on
him
set
free
the
remaining
cats
had
all
races
been
as
barbarously
disposed
as
these
occult-hungering
westerners
cats
would
soon
have
become
extinct
but
it
is
comforting
to
think
that
in
some
parts
of
the
world
a
very
different
value
was
set
on
their
psychic
properties
in
various
parts
of
europe
some
districts
of
england
included
white
cats
were
thought
to
attract
benevolently
disposed
fairies
and
a
peasant
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
cutting
off
his
fingers
or
otherwise
maltreating
himself
as
being
unkind
to
an
animal
of
this
species
in
the
fairy
lore
of
half
europe
we
have
instances
of
luck-bringing
cats--each
country
producing
its
own
version
of
puss
in
boots
dame
mitchell
and
her
cat
the
white
cat
dick
whittington
and
his
cat
etc
it
is
the
same
in
asia
too
for
nowhere
are
such
stories
more
prolific
than
in
china
and
persia
to
sum
up--in
all
climes
and
in
all
periods
of
past
history
the
cat
was
credited
with
many
propensities
that
brought
it
into
affinity
and
sympathy
with
the
supernatural--or
to
quote
the
up-to-date
term--superphysical
world
let
us
review
the
cat
to-day
and
see
to
what
extent
this
past
regard
of
it
is
justified
firstly
with
respect
to
it
as
the
harbinger
of
fortune
has
a
cat
insight
into
the
future
can
it
presage
wealth
or
death
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
certain
cats
can
at
all
events
foresee
the
advent
of
the
latter
and
that
they
do
this
in
the
same
manner
as
the
shark
crow
owl
jackal
hyena
etc
viz
by
their
abnormally
developed
sense
of
smell
my
own
and
other
people's
experience
has
led
me
to
believe
that
when
a
person
is
about
to
die
some
kind
of
phantom
maybe
a
spirit
whose
special
function
it
is
to
be
present
on
such
occasions
is
in
close
proximity
to
the
sick
or
injured
one
waiting
to
escort
his
or
her
soul
into
the
world
of
shadows--and
that
certain
cats
scent
its
approach
therein
then--in
this
wonderful
property
of
smell--lies
one
of
the
secrets
to
the
cat's
mysterious
powers
it
has
the
psychic
faculty
of
scent--of
scenting
ghosts
some
people
too
have
this
faculty
in
a
recent
murder
case
in
the
north
of
england
a
rustic
witness
gave
it
in
her
evidence
that
she
was
sure
a
tragedy
was
about
to
happen
because
she
smelt
death
in
the
house
and
it
made
her
very
uneasy
cats
possessing
this
peculiarity
are
affected
in
a
similar
manner--they
are
uneasy
before
a
death
in
a
house
i
have
watched
a
cat
show
gradually
increasing
signs
of
uneasiness
it
has
moved
from
place
to
place
unable
to
settle
in
any
one
spot
for
any
length
of
time
had
frequent
fits
of
shivering
gone
to
the
door
sniffed
the
atmosphere
thrown
back
its
head
and
mewed
in
a
low
plaintive
key
and
shown
the
greatest
reluctance
to
being
alone
in
the
dark
this
faculty--possessed
by
certain
cats--may
in
some
measure
explain
certain
of
the
superstitions
respecting
them
take
for
example
that
of
cats
crossing
one's
path
predicting
death
the
cat
is
drawn
to
the
spot
because
it
scents
the
phantom
of
death
and
cannot
resist
its
magnetic
attraction
from
this
it
does
not
follow
that
the
person
who
sees
the
cat
is
going
to
die
but
that
death
is
overtaking
someone
associated
with
that
person
and
it
is
in
connection
with
the
latter
that
the
spirit
of
the
grave
is
present
employing
as
a
medium
of
prognostication
the
cat
which
has
been
given
the
psychic
faculty
of
smell
that
it
might
be
so
used
but
although
i
regard
this
theory
as
very
feasible
i
do
not
attribute
to
cats
with
the
same
degree
of
certainty
the
power
to
presage
good
fortune
simply
because
i
have
had
no
experience
of
it
myself
yet
adopting
the
same
lines
of
argument
i
see
no
reason
why
cats
should
not
prognosticate
good
as
well
as
evil
there
may
be
phantoms
representative
of
prosperity
in
just
the
same
manner
as
there
are
those
representative
of
death
they
too
may
also
have
some
distinguishing
scent
flowers
have
various
odours
so
why
not
spirits
and
certain
cats
ie
white
cats
in
particular
may
be
attracted
by
it
this
becomes
all
the
more
probable
when
one
considers
how
very
impressionable
the
cat
is--how
very
sensitive
to
kindness
there
are
some
strangers
with
whom
the
cat
will
at
once
make
friends
and
others
whom
it
will
studiously
avoid
why
the
explanation
i
fancy
lies
once
more
in
the
occult--in
the
cat's
psychic
faculty
of
smell
kind
people
attract
benevolently
disposed
phantoms
which
bring
with
them
an
agreeably
scented
atmosphere
that
in
turn
attracts
cats
the
cat
comes
to
one
person
because
it
knows
by
the
smell
of
the
atmosphere
surrounding
him
or
her
that
it
has
nothing
to
fear--that
the
person
is
essentially
gentle
and
benignant
on
the
contrary
cruel
people
attract
malevolent
phantoms
distinguishable
also
to
the
cat
by
their
smell
a
smell
typical
of
cruelty--often
of
homicidal
lunacy
i
have
particularly
noticed
how
cats
have
shrunk
from
people
who
have
afterwards
become
dangerously
insane
is
this
sense
of
smell
then
the
keynote
to
the
halo
of
mystery
that
has
for
all
times
surrounded
the
cat--that
has
led
to
its
bitter
persecution--that
has
made
it
the
hero
of
fairy
lore
the
pet
of
old
maids
i
believe
it
is--i
believe
that
in
this
psychic
faculty
of
smell
lies
in
degree
the
solution
to
the
oft-asked
riddle--why
is
the
cat
uncanny
having
then
satisfied
oneself
on
this
point
namely
that
cats
are
in
the
possession
of
rare
psychic
properties
is
it
likely
that
the
unknown
powers
which
have
so
endowed
them
should
withhold
from
them
either
souls
or
spirits
is
it
not
contrary
to
reason
instinct
and
observation
to
suppose
that
the
many
thoroughly
material
and
grossly
minded
people--people
whose
whole
beings
are
steeped
in
money
worship--we
see
around
us
every
day
should
have
spirits
and
that
pretty
refined
and
artistic-looking
cats
whose
occult
powers
place
them
in
the
very
closest
connection
with
the
superphysical
should
not
monstrous--the
bare
conception
of
such
incongruity
in
the
one
case
and
such
an
omission
in
the
other
is
inconceivable
wholly
irreconcilable
with
the
notion
of
any
other
than
a
mummer
of
a
creator--a
mere
court
fool
of
a
god
apparitions
of
dogs
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
cases
of
hauntings
by
the
phantasms
of
dogs
is
related
in
an
old
christmas
number
of
the
review
of
reviews
edited
by
the
late
mr
wt
stead
and
entitled
real
ghost
stories
the
most
remarkable
writes
mr
stead
of
all
the
stories
which
i
have
heard
concerning
ghosts
which
touch
is
one
that
reaches
me
from
darlington
i
owe
this
as
i
owe
so
many
of
the
other
narratives
in
this
collection
to
the
rev
harry
kendall
of
darlington
whose
painstaking
perseverance
in
the
collection
of
all
matters
of
this
kind
cannot
be
too
highly
praised
mr
kendall
is
a
congregational
minister
of
old
standing
he
was
my
pastor
when
i
was
editing
the
northern
echo
and
he
is
the
author
of
a
remarkable
book
entitled
all
the
world's
akin
the
following
narrative
is
quite
unique
in
its
way
and
fortunately
he
was
able
to
get
it
at
first
hand
from
the
only
living
person
present
here
we
have
a
ghost
which
not
only
strikes
the
first
blow
hitting
a
man
fair
in
the
eye
but
afterwards
sets
a
ghostly
dog
upon
his
victim
and
then
disappears
the
narrative
was
signed
by
mr
james
durham
as
lately
as
december
5th
1890
mr
stead
then
proceeds
to
quote
the
account
which
he
had
from
mr
kendall
and
which
i
append
ad
verbum
from
the
review
of
reviews
it
is
as
follows
i
was
night
watchman
at
the
old
darlington
and
stockton
station
at
the
town
of
darlington
a
few
yards
from
the
first
station
that
ever
existed
i
was
there
fifteen
years
i
used
to
go
on
duty
about
8
pm
and
come
off
at
6
am
i
had
been
there
a
little
while--perhaps
two
or
three
years--and
about
forty
years
ago
one
night
during
winter
at
about
12
o'clock
or
1230
i
was
feeling
rather
cold
with
standing
here
and
there
i
said
to
myself
'i
will
away
down
and
get
something
to
eat'
there
was
a
porter's
cellar
where
a
fire
was
kept
on
and
a
coal-house
was
connected
with
it
so
i
went
down
the
steps
took
off
my
overcoat
and
had
just
sat
down
on
the
bench
opposite
the
fire
and
turned
up
the
gas
when
a
strange
man
came
out
of
the
coal-house
followed
by
a
big
black
retriever
as
soon
as
he
entered
my
eye
was
upon
him
and
his
eye
upon
me
and
we
were
intently
watching
each
other
as
he
moved
on
to
the
front
of
the
fire
there
he
stood
looking
at
me
and
a
curious
smile
came
over
his
countenance
he
had
a
stand-up
collar
and
a
cut-away
coat
with
gilt
buttons
and
a
scotch
cap
all
at
once
he
struck
at
me
and
i
had
the
impression
that
he
hit
me
i
up
with
my
fist
and
struck
back
at
him
my
fist
seemed
to
go
through
him
and
struck
against
the
stone
above
the
fireplace
and
knocked
the
skin
off
my
knuckles
the
man
seemed
to
be
struck
back
into
the
fire
and
uttered
a
strange
unearthly
squeak
immediately
the
dog
gripped
me
by
the
calf
of
my
leg
and
seemed
to
cause
me
pain
the
man
recovered
his
position
called
off
the
dog
with
a
sort
of
click
of
the
tongue
then
went
back
into
the
coal-house
followed
by
the
dog
i
lighted
my
dark
lantern
and
looked
into
the
coal-house
but
there
was
neither
dog
nor
man
and
no
outlet
for
them
except
the
one
by
which
they
had
entered
i
was
satisfied
that
what
i
had
seen
was
ghostly
and
it
accounted
for
the
fact
that
when
the
man
had
first
come
into
the
place
where
he
sat
i
had
not
challenged
him
with
any
enquiry
next
day
and
for
several
weeks
my
account
caused
quite
a
commotion
and
a
host
of
people
spoke
to
me
about
it
among
the
rest
old
edward
pease
father
of
railways
and
his
three
sons
john
joseph
and
henry
old
edward
sent
for
me
to
his
house
and
asked
me
all
particulars
he
and
others
put
this
question
to
me
are
you
sure
you
were
not
asleep
and
had
the
nightmare
my
answer
was
quite
sure
for
i
had
not
been
a
minute
in
the
cellar
and
was
just
going
to
get
something
to
eat
i
was
certainly
not
under
the
influence
of
strong
drink
for
i
was
then
as
i
have
been
for
forty-nine
years
a
teetotaler
my
mind
at
the
time
was
perfectly
free
from
trouble
what
increased
the
excitement
was
the
fact
that
a
man
a
number
of
years
before
who
was
employed
in
the
office
of
the
station
had
committed
suicide
and
his
body
had
been
carried
into
this
very
cellar
i
knew
nothing
of
this
circumstance
nor
of
the
body
of
the
man
but
mr
pease
and
others
who
had
known
him
told
me
my
description
exactly
corresponded
to
his
appearance
and
the
way
he
dressed
and
also
that
he
had
a
black
retriever
just
like
the
one
which
gripped
me
i
should
add
that
no
mark
or
effect
remained
on
the
spot
where
i
seemed
to
be
seized
signed
james
durham
dec
9th
1890
following
the
above
statement
mr
stead
appends
mr
kendall's
reasons
for
believing
that
what
james
durham
experienced
was
objective
psychic
phenomena
and
neither
produced
during
sleep
nor
by
hallucination
the
arguments
used
strike
me
as
being
so
concise
and
sensible
that
i
think
it
will
not
be
out
of
place
to
reproduce
them
first
mr
kendall
says
he
james
durham
was
accustomed
as
watchman
to
be
up
all
night
and
therefore
not
likely
from
that
cause
to
feel
sleepy
secondly
he
had
scarcely
been
a
minute
in
the
cellar
and
feeling
hungry
was
just
going
to
get
something
to
eat
thirdly
if
he
was
asleep
at
the
beginning
of
the
vision
he
must
have
been
awake
enough
during
the
latter
part
of
it
when
he
had
knocked
the
skin
off
his
knuckles
fourthly
there
was
his
own
confident
testimony
i
strongly
incline
to
the
opinion
that
there
was
an
objective
cause
for
the
vision
and
that
it
was
genuinely
apparitional
so
interested
was
mr
kendall
in
the
case
that
he
visited
the
spot
some
short
time
later
he
was
taken
into
the
cellar
where
the
manifestations
took
place
and
his
guide
an
old
official
of
the
north
road
station
informed
him
he
well
remembered
the
clerk--a
man
of
the
name
of
winter--who
committed
suicide
there
and
showed
him
the
exact
spot
where
he
had
shot
himself
with
a
pistol
in
dress
and
appearance
mr
winter
corresponded
minutely
with
the
phenomenon
described
by
james
durham
and
he
had
had
a
black
retriever
mr
kendal
came
away
more
convinced
than
ever
of
the
veracity
of
james
durham's
story
though
he
admits
it
was
not
evidential
after
the
high
standard
of
the
spr
i
do
not
know
whether
the
spr
published
the
case
and
i
certainly
do
not
think
mr
kendall
need
have
minded
if
they
did
not--for
after
all
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
the
judgment
of
the
spr
is
always
infallible
mr
stead
does
not
comment
on
the
apparition
of
the
dog
which
leads
one
to
suppose
cases
of
animal
phantasms
were
by
no
means
uncommon
to
him
the
grey
dog
of
----
house
birmingham
according
to
a
story
current
in
the
midlands
a
house
in
birmingham
near
the
roman
catholic
cathedral
was
once
very
badly
haunted
a
family
who
took
up
their
abode
in
it
in
the
'eighties
complained
of
hearing
all
sorts
of
uncanny
sounds--such
as
screams
and
sighs--coming
from
a
room
behind
the
kitchen
on
one
occasion
the
tenant's
wife
on
entering
the
sitting-room
was
almost
startled
out
of
her
senses
at
seeing
standing
before
the
fireplace
the
figure
of
a
tall
stout
man
with
a
large
grey
dog
by
his
side
what
was
so
alarming
about
the
man
was
his
face--it
was
apparently
a
mere
blob
of
flesh
without
any
features
in
it
the
lady
screamed
out
whereupon
there
was
a
terrific
crash
as
if
all
the
crockery
in
the
house
had
been
suddenly
clashed
on
the
stone
floor
and
a
friend
of
the
lady's
attracted
to
the
spot
by
the
noise
saw
two
clouds
of
vapour
one
resembling
a
man
and
the
other
a
dog
which
after
hovering
over
the
hearth
for
several
seconds
finally
dispersed
altogether
a
gasfitter
when
working
in
the
house
saw
the
same
figures
no
less
than
nine
times
and
so
distinctly
that
he
was
able
to
give
a
detailed
description
of
both
the
man
and
dog
the
house
seems
to
have
been
well
known
in
birmingham
and
was
certainly
standing
as
recently
as
1885
many
theories
were
advanced
as
to
its
history
the
one
gaining
most
credence
being
that
it
was
occupied
in
1829
by
a
man
who
supplied
the
medical
students
with
human
bodies
it
was
noticed
at
the
time
that
many
people
who
were
seen
to
enter
the
house
in
the
company
of
the
owner
were
never
seen
to
leave
it
which
accords
well
with
the
theory
of
resurrection
men
no
suggestion
has
been
offered
to
account
for
the
animal
which
may
very
easily
have
been
the
phantom
of
the
murderer's
dog
or
what
is
rather
less
likely
the
dog
of
one
of
his
numerous
victims
anyhow
explanation
or
no
explanation
the
fact
remains
the
house
was
haunted
in
the
manner
described
and
f
grey
a
warwickshire
chief
constable
in
his
recollections
published
1821
alludes
to
it
the
dog
in
the
cupboard
miss
prettyman
whom
i
met
some
years
ago
in
cornwall
told
me
she
once
lived
in
a
house
in
westmorland
that
was
haunted
by
the
apparition
of
a
large
dog
enveloped
in
a
blueish
glow
which
apparently
emanated
from
within
it
the
dog
whilst
appearing
in
all
parts
of
the
house
invariably
vanished
in
a
big
cupboard
at
the
back
of
the
hall
staircase
miss
prettyman
her
family
several
of
their
visitors
and
the
servants
all
saw
the
same
phantasm
and
were
perhaps
more
frightened
by
the
suddenness
of
its
advent
than
by
its
actual
appearance
the
theory
was
that
it
was
the
ghost
of
some
dog
that
had
been
cruelly
done
to
death--possibly
by
starvation--in
the
cupboard
how
the
ghost
of
a
dog
saved
life
when
i
was
a
boy
an
elderly
friend
of
mine
miss
lefanu
narrated
to
me
an
anecdote
which
impressed
me
much
it
was
to
this
effect
miss
lefanu
was
walking
one
day
along
a
very
lonely
country
lane
when
she
suddenly
observed
an
enormous
newfoundland
dog
following
in
her
wake
a
few
yards
behind
being
very
fond
of
dogs
she
called
out
to
it
in
a
caressing
voice
and
endeavoured
to
stroke
it
to
her
disappointment
however
it
dodged
aside
and
repeated
the
manoeuvre
every
time
she
tried
to
touch
it
at
length
losing
patience
she
desisted
and
resumed
her
walk
the
dog
still
following
her
in
this
fashion
they
went
on
until
they
came
to
a
particularly
dark
part
of
the
road
where
the
branches
of
the
trees
almost
met
overhead
and
there
was
a
pool
of
stagnant
slimy
water
suggestive
of
great
depth
on
the
one
side
the
hedge
was
high
but
on
the
other
there
was
a
slight
gap
leading
into
a
thick
spinney
miss
lefanu
never
visited
the
spot
alone
after
dusk
and
had
been
warned
against
it
even
in
the
daytime
as
she
drew
near
to
it
everything
that
she
had
ever
heard
about
it
flashed
across
her
mind
and
she
was
more
than
once
on
the
verge
of
turning
back
when
the
sight
of
the
big
friendly-looking
dog
plodding
behind
reassuring
her
she
pressed
on
just
as
she
came
to
the
gap
there
was
a
loud
snapping
of
twigs
and
to
her
horror
two
tramps
with
singularly
sinister
faces
sprang
out
and
were
about
to
strike
her
with
their
bludgeons
when
the
dog
uttering
a
low
ominous
growl
dashed
at
them
in
an
instant
the
expression
of
murderous
joy
in
their
eyes
died
out
one
of
abject
terror
took
its
place
and
dropping
their
weapons
they
fled
as
if
the
very
salvation
of
their
souls
depended
on
it
as
may
be
imagined
miss
lefanu
lost
no
time
in
getting
home
and
the
first
thing
she
did
on
arriving
there
was
to
go
into
the
kitchen
and
order
the
cook
to
prepare
at
once
a
thoroughly
good
meal
for
her
gallant
rescuer--the
newfoundland
dog
which
she
had
shut
up
securely
in
the
back
yard
with
the
laughing
remark
there--you
can't
escape
me
now
judge
of
her
astonishment
however
when
on
her
return
the
dog
had
gone
as
the
walls
of
the
back
yard
were
twelve
feet
high
and
the
doors
had
been
shut
all
the
while--no
one
having
passed
through
them--it
was
impossible
for
the
animal
to
have
escaped
and
the
only
interpretation
that
could
possibly
be
put
on
the
matter
was
that
the
dog
was
superphysical--a
conclusion
that
was
subsequently
confirmed
by
the
experiences
of
various
other
people
as
the
result
of
exhaustive
enquiries
miss
lefanu
eventually
learned
that
many
years
before
on
the
very
spot
where
the
tramps
had
leaped
out
on
her
a
pedlar
and
his
newfoundland
dog
had
been
discovered
murdered
this
story
being
true
then
there
is
one
more
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
to
show
that
dogs
as
well
as
men
have
spirits
and
spirits
that
can
on
occasion
at
least
perform
deeds
of
practical
service
a
precentor's
story
the
late
mr
wt
stead
in
his
volume
of
real
ghost
stories
narrates
the
following
which
by
reason
of
its
being
witnessed
by
three
people
simultaneously
may
be
regarded
as
highly
evidential
in
reply
to
mr
stead's
request
to
hear
the
anecdote
the
precentor
says
i
quote
him
ad
verbum
i
was
walking
about
nine
years
ago
one
night
in
august
about
ten
o'clock
and
about
half
a
mile
from
the
house
where
we
are
now
sitting
i
was
going
along
the
public
road
between
the
hamlets
of
mill
of
haldane
and
ballock
i
had
with
me
two
young
women
and
we
were
leisurely
walking
along
when
suddenly
we
were
startled
by
seeing
a
woman
a
child
about
seven
years
old
and
a
newfoundland
dog
jump
over
the
stone
wall
which
was
on
one
side
of
the
road
and
walk
on
rapidly
in
front
of
us
i
was
not
in
the
least
frightened
but
my
two
companions
were
very
much
startled
what
bothered
me
was
that
the
woman
the
child
and
the
dog
instead
of
coming
over
the
wall
naturally
one
after
the
other
as
would
have
been
necessary
for
them
to
do
had
come
over
with
a
bound
simultaneously
leaping
the
wall
lighting
on
the
road
and
then
hurrying
on
without
a
word
leaving
my
two
companions
who
were
too
frightened
to
move
i
walked
rapidly
after
the
trio
they
walked
on
so
quickly
that
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
got
up
to
them
i
spoke
to
the
woman
she
never
answered
i
walked
beside
her
for
some
little
distance
and
then
suddenly
the
woman
the
child
and
the
newfoundland
dog
disappeared
i
did
not
see
them
go
anywhere
they
simply
were
no
longer
there
i
examined
the
road
minutely
at
the
spot
where
they
had
disappeared
to
see
if
it
was
possible
for
them
to
have
gone
through
a
hole
in
the
wall
on
either
side
but
it
was
quite
impossible
for
a
woman
and
a
child
to
get
over
a
high
dyke
on
either
side
they
had
disappeared
and
i
only
regret
that
i
did
not
try
to
pass
my
stick
right
through
their
bodies
to
see
whether
or
not
they
had
any
resistance
finding
they
had
gone
i
returned
to
my
lady
friends
who
were
quite
unnerved
and
who
with
difficulty
were
induced
to
go
on
to
the
end
of
their
journey
one
of
his
companions
mr
stead
goes
on
to
explain
who
heard
him
tell
the
story
at
the
time
corroborated
the
fact
that
it
had
made
a
great
impression
on
those
who
had
seen
it
nothing
was
ever
ascertained
as
to
any
woman
child
or
newfoundland
dog
that
had
ever
been
in
the
district
before
when
they
got
to
ballock
they
enquired
of
the
keeper
of
the
bridge
whether
a
woman
a
child
and
a
dog
had
passed
that
way
but
he
had
seen
nothing
the
apparition
had
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
it
had
appeared
mr
stead's
article
ends
here
of
course
one
can
only
surmise
as
to
the
nature
of
the
phenomena
no
member
of
the
psychical
research
society
could
do
more--and
in
the
absence
of
any
authentic
history
of
the
spot
where
the
manifestations
occurred
such
a
surmise
can
be
of
little
value
since
the
phenomena
were
seen
by
three
people
at
the
same
time
it
is
quite
safe
to
assume
they
were
objective
but
it
is
impossible
to
lay
down
the
law
as
to
whether
they
were
actual
phantasms
of
the
dead--of
a
woman
child
and
newfoundland
dog
who
had
all
three
met
with
some
violent
end--or
phantasms
of
three
living
beings
who
happening
to
think
of
that
locality
at
the
same
time
had
projected
their
immaterial
bodies
there
simultaneously
but
whichever
of
these
alternatives
be
true
the
same
thing
holds
good
in
either
case
viz
that
the
newfoundland
dog
had
a
spirit--and
what
applies
to
one
dog
should
assuredly
apply
to
the
generality
if
not
indeed
to
all
phantom
dog
seen
on
souter
fell
miss
harriet
martineau
in
her
english
lakes
refers
to
certain
strange
phenomena
seen
from
time
to
time
on
souter
fell
in
1745
for
example
a
mr
wren
and
his
servant
saw
simultaneously
a
man
and
dog
pursuing
some
horses
along
a
razor-like
ridge
of
rocks
on
which
it
was
obviously
impossible
for
any
ordinary
being
to
gain
a
bare
foothold
let
alone
walk
they
watched
the
figures
until
the
latter
suddenly
vanished
when
mr
wren
and
his
servant
thinking
perhaps
the
man
dog
and
horses
had
really
fallen
over
the
cliff
went
to
look
for
them
they
searched
elsewhere
but
despite
their
vigilance
nothing
was
to
be
found
and
convinced
at
last
that
what
they
had
seen
was
something
superphysical
they
came
away
mystified
and
no
doubt
somewhat
frightened
there
is
no
suggestion
to
make
here
other
than
the
manifestations
may
have
been
the
phantasms
of
a
man
dog
and
horses
that
at
some
former
date
had
been
killed
either
accidentally
or
purposely
in
or
near
that
spot
the
jumping
ghost
mr
george
sinclair
in
his
work
satan's
invisible
world
discovered
gives
a
detailed
account
of
hauntings
in
a
house
in
mary
king's
close
edinburgh
the
house
at
the
time
mr
sinclair
writes
was
occupied
by
mr
thomas
coltheart
a
law
agent
seated
one
afternoon
at
home
reading
mrs
coltheart
was
immeasurably
startled
at
seeing
suspended
in
mid-air
gazing
at
her
the
head
of
an
old
man
she
uttered
some
sort
of
exclamation
most
probably
a
cry
and
the
apparition
at
once
vanished
some
nights
later
when
in
bed
both
she
and
her
husband
saw
the
same
head
which
was
presently
joined
by
the
head
of
a
child
and
a
long
naked
arm
which
tried
to
catch
hold
of
them
on
another
occasion
a
member
of
the
coltheart
family
was
greatly
alarmed
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
large
dog
which
leaped
on
the
chair
by
her
side
and
as
suddenly
disappeared
every
effort
was
made
to
lay
the
ghosts
ministers--and
one
knows
how
pious
scotch
clergymen
are--were
called
in
but
their
exhortations
instead
of
dispelling
or
even
minimizing
the
phenomena
only
increased
them
it
was
a
case
of
more
prayers
more
spooks
which
state
of
affairs
however
complimentary
to
the
ministers'
powers
of
address
was
scarcely
as
comforting
to
the
colthearts
who
unable
to
bear
the
strange
sights
and
noises
any
longer
evacuated
the
premises
as
no
other
tenants
could
be
found
the
house
was
eventually
pulled
down
and
a
row
of
fine
modern
buildings
now
occupy
the
site
as
the
history
of
the
place
could
never
be
traced
with
any
degree
of
authenticity
one
can
do
no
more
than
speculate
as
to
the
cause
of
the
disturbances
which
i
am
inclined
to
think
were
due
to
the
phantoms
of
people
and
animals
that
had
once
actually
lived
and
died
there
dogs
seen
before
a
death
mrs
crowe
in
her
night
side
of
nature
mentions
the
case
of
a
young
lady
named
p----
who
saw
a
big
black
dog
twice
suddenly
appear
and
disappear
by
her
side
immediately
before
the
death
of
her
mother
in
the
unseen
world
a
story
is
also
told
of
the
phantasm
of
a
big
black
dog
appearing
on
the
bed
of
a
cornish
child
doomed
to
die
shortly
afterwards
the
same
dog
invariably
manifesting
itself
before
the
death
of
any
member
of
the
child's
family
there
are
so
many
cases
of
a
similar
kind--one
hears
of
them
nearly
everywhere
one
goes--that
one
is
led
to
believe
some
of
them
at
least
must
be
true
there
is
no
more
reason
to
believe
all
ghost-story
tellers
are
liars
than
there
is
to
believe
all
parsons
are
liars--and
this
being
so
additional
proof
is
afforded
of
the
continuation
of
the
dog's
life
after
death
for
these
family
canine
ghosts
are
more
than
probably
the
phantasms
of
dogs
that
once
belonged
to
families--maybe
centuries
ago--and
met
their
fate
in
some
cruel
and
unnatural
manner
a
dog
scared
by
a
canine
ghost
a
friend
of
mine
edward
morgan
had
a
terrier
that
was
found
one
morning
poisoned
in
a
big
stone
kennel
soon
afterwards
this
friend
came
to
me
and
said
i
have
got
a
new
dog--a
spaniel--but
nothing
will
induce
it
to
enter
the
kennel
in
which
poor
zack
was
poisoned
come
and
see
i
did
so
and
what
he
said
was
true
mack
morgan
gave
all
his
dogs
names
that
rhymed--zack
mack
jack
tack
and
even
whack
and
smack
when
carried
to
the
entrance
of
the
kennel
resolutely
refused
to
cross
the
threshold
barking
whining
and
exhibiting
unmistakable
symptoms
of
fear
i
knelt
down
and
peering
into
the
kennel
saw
two
luminous
eyes
and
the
distinct
outlines
of
a
dog's
head
morgan
i
exclaimed
the
mystery
is
easily
solved
there's
a
dog
in
here
nonsense
morgan
cried
speaking
very
excitedly
but
there
is
i
retorted
see
for
yourself
morgan
immediately
bent
down
and
poked
his
head
into
the
kennel
what
rot
he
said
you're
having
me
on
there's
nothing
here
what
i
cried
do
you
mean
to
say
you
can
see
no
dog
no
he
replied
there
is
none
let
me
look
again
i
said
and
kneeling
down
i
peeped
in
do
you
mean
to
say
you
can't
see
a
dog's
face
and
eyes
looking
straight
at
us
i
asked
no
he
answered
i
can
see
nothing
and
to
prove
to
me
the
truth
of
what
he
said
he
fetched
a
pole
and
raked
about
the
kennel
vigorously
with
it
we
both
then
tried
to
make
mack
enter
and
morgan
at
last
caught
hold
of
him
and
placed
him
forcibly
inside
mack's
terror
knew
no
limit
he
gave
one
loud
howl
and
flying
out
of
the
kennel
with
his
ears
hanging
back
tore
past
into
the
front
garden
where
we
left
him
in
peace
morgan
was
still
sceptical
as
to
there
being
anything
wrong
with
the
kennel
but
two
days
later
wrote
to
me
as
follows--
i
must
apologize
for
doubting
you
the
other
day
i
have
just
had
what
you
declared
you
saw
corroborated
a
friend
of
my
wife's
was
calling
here
this
afternoon
and
on
hearing
of
mack's
refusal
to
sleep
in
the
kennel
at
once
said
'i
know
what's
the
matter
it's
the
smell
mack
scents
the
poison
which
was
used
to
destroy
zack
have
the
kennel
thoroughly
fumigated
and
you'll
have
no
more
trouble'
at
my
wife's
request
she
went
into
the
yard
to
have
a
look
at
it
and
the
moment
she
bent
down
she
cried
out
like
you
did
'why
there's
a
dog
inside--a
terrier'
my
wife
and
i
both
looked
and
could
see
nothing
the
lady
however
persisted
and
on
my
handing
her
a
stick
struck
at
the
figure
she
saw
to
her
amazement
the
stick
went
right
through
it
then
and
not
till
then
did
we
tell
her
of
your
experience
'well'
she
exclaimed
'i
have
never
believed
in
ghosts
but
i
do
so
now
i
am
quite
certain
that
what
i
see
is
the
phantom
of
zack
how
glad
i
am
because
i
am
at
last
assured
animals
have
spirits
and
can
come
back
to
us'
in
concluding
the
accounts
of
phantasms
of
dead
dogs
let
me
quote
two
cases
taken
from
my
work
entitled
the
haunted
houses
of
london
published
by
mr
eveleigh
nash
of
fawside
house
king
street
covent
garden
london
wc
in
1909
the
cases
are
these--

my
correspondent
writes--
though
i
am
by
no
means
over-indulgent
to
dogs
the
latter
generally
greet
me
very
effusively
and
it
would
seem
that
there
is
something
in
my
individuality
that
is
peculiarly
attractive
to
them
this
being
so
i
was
not
greatly
surprised
one
day
when
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
x----
street
to
find
myself
persistently
followed
by
a
rough-haired
dachshund
wearing
a
gaudy
yellow
collar
i
tried
to
scare
it
away
by
shaking
my
sunshade
at
it
but
all
to
no
purpose--it
came
resolutely
on
and
i
was
beginning
to
despair
of
getting
rid
of
it
when
i
came
to
x----
street
where
my
husband
once
practised
as
an
oculist
there
it
suddenly
altered
its
tactics
and
instead
of
keeping
at
my
heels
became
my
conductor
forging
slowly
ahead
with
a
gliding
motion
that
both
puzzled
and
fascinated
me
i
furthermore
observed
that
notwithstanding
the
temperature--it
was
not
a
whit
less
than
ninety
degrees
in
the
shade--the
legs
and
stomach
of
the
dachshund
were
covered
with
mud
and
dripping
with
water
when
it
came
to
no
90
it
halted
and
veering
swiftly
round
eyed
me
in
the
strangest
manner
just
as
if
it
had
some
secret
it
was
bursting
to
disclose
it
remained
in
this
attitude
until
i
was
within
two
or
three
feet
of
it--certainly
not
more--when
to
my
unlimited
amazement
it
absolutely
vanished--melted
away
into
thin
air
the
iron
gate
leading
to
the
area
was
closed
so
that
there
was
nowhere
for
it
to
have
hidden
and
besides
i
was
almost
bending
over
it
at
the
time
as
i
wanted
to
read
the
name
on
its
collar
there
being
no
one
near
at
hand
i
could
not
obtain
a
second
opinion
and
so
came
away
wondering
whether
what
i
had
seen
was
actually
a
phantasm
or
a
mere
hallucination
no
90
i
might
add
judging
by
the
brass
plate
on
the
door
was
inhabited
by
a
doctor
with
an
unpronounceable
foreign
name
etc
etc
i
think
one
cannot
help
attaching
a
great
deal
of
importance
to
what
this
lady
says
as
her
language
is
strictly
moderate
throughout
and
because
she
does
not
seem
to
have
been
biassed
by
any
special
views
on
the
subject
of
animal
futurity
correspondent
no
2
who
by
the
way
is
a
total
stranger
to
the
writer
whose
letter
i
have
just
quoted
is
candidly
devoted
to
dogs
regarding
them
as
in
every
way
on
a
par
with
if
not
actually
superior
to
most
human
beings
still
notwithstanding
this
partiality
and
consequent
profusion
of
terms
of
endearment
which
will
doubtless
prove
somewhat
nauseating
to
many
her
letter
is
in
my
opinion
valuable
because
it
not
only
refers
to
the
phenomenon
i
have
mentioned
but
to
a
certain
extent
furnishes
a
reason
for
its
occurrence
the
lady
writes
as
follows--
i
once
had
a
rough-haired
dachshund
robert
whom
i
loved
devotedly
we
were
living
at
the
time
near
h----
street
which
always
had
a
peculiar
attraction
for
dear
robert
who
i
am
now
obliged
to
confess
had
rather
too
much
liberty--more
indeed
than
eventually
proved
good
for
him
the
servants
complained
that
robert
ruled
the
house
and
i
believe
what
they
said
was
true
for
my
sister
and
i
idolized
him
giving
him
the
very
best
of
everything
and
never
having
the
heart
to
refuse
him
anything
he
wanted
you
will
probably
scarcely
credit
it
but
i
have
sat
up
all
night
nursing
him
when
he
had
a
cold
and
was
otherwise
indisposed
can
you
therefore
imagine
my
feelings
when
my
darling
was
absent
one
day
from
dinner
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
before
for
fond
of
morning
'constitutionals'
as
poor
robert
was
he
was
always
the
soul
of
punctuality
at
meal
times
neither
my
sister
nor
i
would
hear
of
eating
anything
whilst
he
was
missing
not
a
morsel
did
we
touch
but
slipping
on
our
hats
and
bidding
the
servants
do
the
same
we
scoured
the
neighbourhood
instead
the
afternoon
passed
without
any
sign
of
robert
and
when
bedtime
came
he
always
slept
in
our
room
and
still
no
signs
of
our
pet
i
thought
we
should
both
have
gone
mad
of
course
we
advertised
selecting
the
most
popular
and
accordingly
the
most
likely
papers
and
we
resorted
to
other
mediums
too
but
alas
it
was
hopeless
our
darling
little
robert
was
irrevocably
irredeemably
lost
for
days
we
were
utterly
inconsolable
doing
nothing
but
mope
morning
noon
and
night
i
cannot
tell
you
how
forlorn
we
felt
nor
how
long
we
should
have
remained
in
that
state
but
for
an
incident
which
although
revealing
the
terrible
manner
of
his
death
gave
us
every
reason
to
feel
sure
we
were
not
parted
from
him
for
all
time
but
would
meet
again
in
the
great
hereafter
it
happened
in
this
wise
i
was
walking
along
w----
street
one
evening
when
to
my
intense
joy
and
surprise
i
suddenly
saw
my
darling
standing
on
the
pavement
a
few
feet
ahead
of
me
regarding
me
intently
from
out
of
his
pathetic
brown
eyes
a
sensation
of
extreme
coldness
now
stole
over
me
and
i
noticed
with
something
akin
to
a
shock
that
in
spite
of
the
hot
dry
weather
robert
looked
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
rain
for
hours
he
wore
the
bright
yellow
collar
i
had
bought
him
shortly
before
his
disappearance
so
that
had
there
been
any
doubt
as
to
his
identity
that
would
have
removed
it
instantly
on
my
calling
to
him
he
turned
quickly
round
and
with
a
slight
gesture
of
the
head
as
if
bidding
me
to
follow
he
glided
forward
my
natural
impulse
was
to
run
after
him
pick
him
up
and
smother
him
with
kisses
but
try
as
hard
as
i
could
i
could
not
diminish
the
distance
between
us
although
he
never
appeared
to
alter
his
pace
i
was
quite
out
of
breath
by
the
time
we
reached
h----
street
where
to
my
surprise
he
stopped
at
no
90
and
turning
round
again
gazed
at
me
in
the
most
beseeching
manner
i
can't
describe
that
look
suffice
it
to
say
that
no
human
eyes
could
have
been
more
expressive
but
of
what
beyond
the
most
profound
love
and
sorrow
i
cannot
i
dare
not
attempt
to
state
i
have
pondered
upon
it
through
the
whole
of
a
mid-summer
night
but
not
even
the
severest
of
my
mental
efforts
have
enabled
me
to
solve
it
to
my
satisfaction
could
i
but
do
that
i
feel
i
should
have
fathomed
the
greatest
of
all
mysteries--the
mystery
of
life
and
death
i
do
not
know
for
how
long
we
stood
there
looking
at
one
another
it
may
have
been
minutes
or
hours
or
again
but
a
few
paltry
seconds
he
took
the
initiative
from
me
for
as
i
leaped
forward
to
raise
him
in
my
arms
he
glided
through
the
stone
steps
into
the
area
convinced
now
that
what
i
beheld
was
robert's
apparition
i
determined
to
see
the
strange
affair
through
to
the
bitter
end
and
entering
the
gate
i
also
went
down
into
the
area
the
phantom
had
come
to
an
abrupt
halt
by
the
side
of
a
low
wooden
box
and
as
i
foolishly
made
an
abortive
attempt
to
reach
it
with
my
hand
it
vanished
instantaneously
i
searched
the
area
thoroughly
and
was
assured
that
there
was
no
outlet
save
by
the
steps
i
had
just
descended
and
no
hole
nor
nook
nor
cranny
where
anything
the
size
of
robert
could
be
completely
hidden
from
sight
what
did
it
all
mean
ah
i
knew
robert
had
always
had
a
weakness
for
exploring
areas
especially
in
h----
street
and
in
the
box
where
his
wraith
disappeared
i
espied
a
piece
of
raw
meat
now
there
are
ways
in
which
a
piece
of
raw
meat
may
lie
without
arousing
suspicion
but
the
position
of
this
morsel
strangely
suggested
that
it
had
been
placed
there
carefully
and
for
assuredly
no
other
purpose
than
to
entice
stray
animals
resolving
to
interrogate
the
owner
of
the
house
on
the
subject
i
rapped
at
the
front
door
but
was
informed
by
the
manservant
obviously
a
german
that
his
master
never
saw
anyone
without
an
appointment
i
then
did
a
very
unwise
thing--i
explained
the
purpose
of
my
visit
to
this
man
who
not
only
denied
any
knowledge
of
my
dog
but
declared
the
meat
must
have
been
thrown
into
the
area
by
some
passer-by
'no
one
in
dis
house
trow
away
gut
meat
like
dat'
he
explained
'we
eat
all
we
can
git
here
we
have
nutting
for
de
animals
please
go
away
at
once
or
de
master
will
be
very
angry
he
stand
no
nonsense
from
anyone'
and
as
i
had
no
alternative--for
after
all
who
would
regard
a
ghost
in
the
light
of
evidence--i
had
to
obey
i
found
out
however
from
a
medical
friend
that
no
90
was
tenanted
by
mr
k----
an
anglo-german
who
was
deemed
a
very
clever
fellow
at
a
certain
london
hospital
where
he
was
often
occupied
in
vivisection
'i
dare
say'
my
friend
went
on
to
remark
'k----
does
a
little
vivisecting
in
his
private
surgery
by
way
of
practice
and--well
you
see
these
foreign
chaps
are
not
so
squeamish
in
some
respects
as
we
are'
'but
can't
he
be
stopped'
i
asked
'it
is
horrible
monstrous
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
murder
our
pets'
'you
don't
know
for
certain
that
he
has'
was
the
reply
'you
only
suppose
so
from
what
you
say
you
saw
and
evidence
of
that
immaterial
nature
is
no
evidence
at
all
no
you
can
do
nothing
except
to
be
extra
careful
in
future
and
if
you
have
another
dog
make
him
steer
clear
of
no
90
h----
street'
i
was
sensible
enough
to
see
that
he
was
right
and
the
matter
dropped
i
soon
noticed
one
thing
however
namely
that
there
were
no
more
pieces
of
meat
temptingly
displayed
in
the
box
so
it
is
just
possible
k----
got
wind
of
my
enquiries
and
thought
it
policy
to
desist
from
his
nefarious
practices
poor
robert
to
think
of
him
suffering
such
a
cruel
and
ignominious
death
and
my
being
powerless
to
avenge
it
surely
if
vivisection
is
really
necessary
and
the
welfare
of
mankind
cannot
be
advanced
by
any
less
barbarous
system
why
not
operate
on
creatures
less
deserving
of
our
love
and
pity
than
dogs
on
creatures
which
whilst
being
nearer
allied
to
man
in
physiology
and
anatomy
are
at
the
same
time
far
below
the
level
of
brute
creation
in
character
and
disposition
for
example
why
not
experiment
on
wife-beaters
and
cowardly
street
ruffians
and
one
might
reasonably
add
on
all
those
pseudo-humanitarians
who
by
their
constant
petitions
to
parliament
for
the
abolition
of
the
lash
encourage
every
form
of
blackguardism
and
bestiality
this
concludes
the
letter
of
correspondent
no
2
and
with
the
sentiment
in
the
closing
paragraphs
i
must
say
i
heartily
agree--only
i
should
like
to
add
a
few
more
people
to
the
list
one
other
case
of
haunting
of
this
type
is
taken
from
my
same
work
one
all
hallow
e'en
wrote
a
mrs
sebuim
i
was
staying
with
some
friends
in
hampstead
and
we
amused
ourselves
by
working
spells
to
commemorate
the
night
there
is
one
spell
in
which
one
walks
alone
down
a
path
sowing
hempseed
and
repeating
some
fantastic
words
when
one
is
supposed
to
see
those
that
are
destined
to
come
into
one's
life
in
the
near
future
eager
to
put
this
spell
to
the
test
i
went
into
the
garden
by
myself
and
walking
boldly
along
a
path
bordered
on
each
side
by
evergreens
sprinkled
hempseed
lavishly
nothing
happening
i
was
about
to
desist
when
suddenly
i
heard
a
pattering
on
the
gravel
and
turning
round
i
beheld
an
ugly
little
black-and-tan
mongrel
running
towards
me
wagging
its
stumpy
tail
not
at
all
prepossessed
with
the
creature
for
my
own
dogs
are
pure-bred
and
thinking
it
must
have
strayed
into
the
grounds
i
was
about
to
drive
it
out
and
had
put
down
my
hand
to
prevent
it
jumping
on
my
dress
when
to
my
astonishment
it
had
vanished
it
literally
melted
away
into
fine
air
beneath
my
very
eyes
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
the
incident
but
feeling
inclined
to
attribute
it
to
a
trick
of
the
imagination
i
rejoined
my
friends
i
did
not
tell
them
what
had
happened
although
i
made
a
memorandum
of
it
in
one
of
my
innumerable
notebooks
within
six
months
of
this
incident
i
was
greatly
astonished
to
find
a
dog
corresponding
with
the
one
i
have
just
described
running
about
on
the
lawn
of
my
house
in
bath
how
the
animal
got
there
was
a
complete
mystery
and
what
is
stranger
still
it
seemed
to
recognize
me
for
it
rushed
towards
me
frantically
wagging
its
diminutive
tail
i
had
not
the
heart
to
turn
it
away
as
it
seemed
quite
homeless
and
so
the
forlorn
little
mongrel
was
permitted
to
make
its
home
in
my
house--and
a
very
happy
home
it
proved
to
be
for
three
years
all
went
well
and
then
the
end
came
swiftly
and
unexpectedly
i
was
in
blackheath
at
the
time
and
the
mongrel
was
in
bath
it
was
all
hallow
e'en
but
there
was
no
hempseed
sowing
for
no
one
in
the
house
but
myself
took
the
slightest
interest
in
anything
appertaining
to
the
superphysical
or
mystic
eleven
o'clock
came
and
i
retired
to
rest
my
bed
being
one
of
those
antique
four-posters
hung
with
curtains
that
shine
crimson
in
the
ruddy
glow
of
a
cheerful
fire
all
my
preparations
complete
i
had
pulled
back
the
hangings
and
was
about
to
slip
in
between
the
sheets
when
to
my
unbounded
amazement
what
should
i
see
sitting
on
the
counterpane
but
the
black-and-tan
mongrel
it
was
he
right
enough
there
could
not
be
another
such
ugly
dog
though
unlike
his
usual
self
he
evinced
no
demonstrations
of
joy
on
the
contrary
he
appeared
downright
miserable
his
ears
hung
his
mouth
dropped
and
his
bleared
little
eyes
were
watery
and
sad
greatly
perplexed
if
not
alarmed
at
so
extraordinary
a
phenomenon
i
nevertheless
felt
constrained
to
put
out
my
hand
to
comfort
him--when
as
i
had
half
anticipated
he
immediately
vanished
two
days
later
i
received
a
letter
from
bath
and
in
a
postscript
i
read
that
'the
mongrel'
we
never
called
it
by
any
other
name
'had
been
run
over
and
killed
by
a
motor
the
accident
occurring
on
all
hallow
e'en
about
eleven
o'clock'
'of
course'
my
sister
wrote
'you
won't
mind
very
much--it
was
so
extremely
ugly
and--well--we
were
only
too
glad
it
was
none
of
the
other
dogs'
but
my
sister
was
wrong
for
notwithstanding
its
unsightly
appearance
and
hopeless
lack
of
breed
i
had
grown
to
like
that
little
black-and-tan
more
than
any
of
my
rare
and
choice
pets
the
following
account
which
concludes
my
notes
on
hauntings
by
dog
phantasms
was
sent
me
many
years
ago
by
a
gentleman
then
living
in
virginia
usa
it
runs
thus--
the
strange
disappearance
of
mr
jeremiah
dance
twenty
pounds
a
year
for
a
twelve-roomed
house
with
large
front
lawn
good
stabling
and
big
kitchen
gardens
that
sounds
all
right
i
commented
but
why
so
cheap
well
the
advertiser--mr
baldwin
by
name
a
short
stout
gentleman
with
keen
glittering
eyes--replied
well
you
see
it's
a
bit
of
a
distance
from
the
town
and--er--most
people
prefer
being
nearer--like
neighbours
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
like
neighbours
i
exclaimed
i
don't
i've
just
seen
about
enough
of
them
drains
all
right
oh
yes
perfect
water
excellent
everything
in
good
condition
first
rate
loneliness
the
only
thing
people
object
to
that
is
so
then
i'll
oblige
you
to
send
someone
to
show
me
over
the
house
for
i
think
it
is
just
the
sort
of
place
we
want
you
see
after
being
bottled
up
in
a
theatre
all
the
afternoon
and
evening
one
likes
to
get
away
somewhere
where
it
is
quiet--somewhere
where
one
can
lie
in
bed
in
the
morning
inhaling
pure
air
and
undisturbed
by
street
traffic
i
understand
mr
baldwin
responded
but--er--it
is
rather
late
now
wouldn't
you
prefer
to
see
over
it
in
the
morning
everything
looks
at
its
worst--its
very
worst--in
the
twilight
oh
i'll
make
allowances
for
the
dusk
i
said
you
haven't
got
any
ghosts
stowed
away
there
have
you
and
he
went
off
into
a
roar
of
laughter
no
the
house
is
not
haunted
mr
baldwin
replied
not
that
it
would
much
matter
to
you
if
it
were
for
i
can
see
you
don't
believe
in
spooks
believe
in
spooks
i
cried
not
much
i
would
as
soon
believe
in
patent
hair
restorers
let
me
see
over
it
at
once
very
well
sir
i'll
take
you
there
myself
mr
baldwin
replied
somewhat
reluctantly
here
tim--fetch
the
keys
of
the
crow's
nest
and
tell
higgins
to
bring
the
trap
round
the
boy
he
addressed
flew
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
sound
of
wheels
and
the
jingling
of
harness
announced
the
vehicle
was
at
the
door
ten
minutes
later
and
i
and
my
escort
were
bowling
merrily
over
the
ground
in
the
direction
of
the
crow's
nest
it
was
early
autumn
and
the
cool
evening
air
fragrant
with
the
mellowness
of
the
luscious
virginian
pippin
was
tinged
also
with
the
sadness
inseparable
from
the
demise
of
a
long
and
glorious
summer
evidences
of
decay
and
death
were
everywhere--in
the
brown
fallen
leaves
of
the
oaks
and
elms
in
the
bare
and
denuded
ditches
here
a
giant
mill-wheel
half
immersed
in
a
dark
still
pool
stood
idle
and
silent
there
a
hovel
but
recently
inhabited
by
hop-pickers
was
now
tenantless
its
glassless
windows
boarded
over
and
a
wealth
of
dead
and
rotting
vegetable
matter
in
thick
profusion
over
the
tiny
path
and
the
single
stone
doorstep
is
it
always
as
quiet
and
deserted
as
this
i
asked
of
my
companion
who
continually
cracked
his
whip
as
if
he
liked
to
hear
the
reverberations
of
its
echoes
always
was
the
reply
and
sometimes
more
so
you
ain't
used
to
the
country
not
very
i
want
to
try
it
by
way
of
a
change
are
you
well
versed
in
the
cry
of
birds
what
was
that
we
were
fast
approaching
an
exceedingly
gloomy
bit
of
the
road
where
there
were
plantations
on
each
side
and
the
trees
united
their
fantastically
forked
branches
overhead
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
so
dismal-looking
a
spot
and
a
sudden
lowering
of
the
temperature
made
me
draw
my
overcoat
tighter
round
me
that--oh
a
night
bird
of
some
sort
mr
baldwin
replied
an
ugly
sound
wasn't
it
beastly
things
i
can't
imagine
why
they
were
created
whoa--steady
there
steady
the
horse
reared
as
he
spoke
and
taking
a
violent
plunge
forward
set
off
at
a
wild
gallop
a
moment
later
and
i
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
keeping
pace
with
us
although
apparently
not
moving
at
more
than
an
ordinary
walking
pace
was
a
man
of
medium
height
dressed
in
a
panama
hat
and
albert
coat
he
had
a
thin
aquiline
nose
a
rather
pronounced
chin
was
clean-shaven
and
had
a
startlingly
white
complexion
by
the
side
of
him
trotted
two
poodles
whose
close-cropped
skins
showed
out
with
remarkable
perspicuity
who
the
deuce
is
he
i
asked
raising
my
voice
to
a
shout
on
account
of
the
loud
clatter
made
by
the
horse's
hoofs
and
the
wheels
who
what
mr
baldwin
shouted
in
return
why
the
man
walking
along
with
us
man
i
can
see
no
man
mr
baldwin
growled
i
looked
at
him
curiously
it
may
of
course
have
been
due
to
the
terrific
speed
we
were
going
to
the
difficulty
of
holding
in
the
horse
but
his
cheeks
were
ashy
pale
and
his
teeth
chattered
do
you
mean
to
say
i
cried
that
you
can
see
no
figure
walking
on
my
side
of
the
horse
and
actually
keeping
pace
with
it
of
course
i
can't
mr
baldwin
snapped
no
more
can
you
it's
an
hallucination
caused
by
the
moonlight
through
the
branches
overhead
i've
experienced
it
more
than
once
then
why
don't
you
have
it
now
i
queried
don't
ask
so
many
questions
please
mr
baldwin
shouted
don't
you
see
it
is
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
hold
the
brute
in
heaven
preserve
us
we
were
nearly
over
that
time
the
trap
rose
high
in
the
air
as
he
spoke
and
then
dropped
with
such
a
jolt
that
i
was
nearly
thrown
off
and
only
saved
myself
by
the
skin
of
my
teeth
a
few
yards
more
the
spinney
ceased
and
we
were
away
out
in
the
open
country
plunging
and
galloping
as
if
our
very
souls
depended
on
it
from
all
sides
queer
and
fantastic
shadows
of
objects
which
certainly
had
no
material
counterparts
in
the
moon-kissed
sward
of
the
rich
ripe
meadows
rose
to
greet
us
and
filled
the
lane
with
their
black-and-white
wavering
ethereal
forms
the
evening
was
one
of
wonders
for
which
i
had
no
name--wonders
associated
with
an
iciness
that
was
far
from
agreeable
i
was
not
at
all
sure
which
i
liked
best--the
black
stygian
tree-lined
part
of
the
road
we
had
just
left
or
the
wide
ocean
of
brilliant
moonbeams
and
streaked
suggestions
the
figures
of
the
man
and
the
dogs
were
equally
vivid
in
each
though
i
could
no
longer
doubt
they
were
nothing
mortal
they
were
altogether
unlike
what
i
had
imagined
ghosts
like
the
generality
of
people
who
are
psychic
and
who
have
never
had
an
experience
of
the
superphysical
my
conception
of
a
phantasm
was
a
thing
in
white
that
made
ridiculous
groanings
and
still
more
ridiculous
clankings
of
chains
but
here
was
something
different
something
that
looked--save
perhaps
for
the
excessive
pallor
of
its
cheeks--just
like
an
ordinary
man
i
knew
it
was
not
a
man
partly
on
account
of
its
extraordinary
performance--no
man
even
if
running
at
full
speed
could
keep
up
with
us
like
that
partly
on
account
of
the
unusual
nature
of
the
atmosphere--which
was
altogether
indefinable--it
brought
with
it
and
also
because
of
my
own
sensations--my
intense
horror
which
could
not
i
felt
certain
have
been
generated
by
anything
physical
i
cogitated
all
this
in
my
mind
as
i
gazed
at
the
figure
and
in
order
to
make
sure
it
was
no
hallucination
i
shut
first
one
eye
and
then
the
other
covering
them
alternately
with
the
palm
of
my
hand
the
figure
however
was
still
there
still
pacing
along
at
our
side
with
the
regular
swing
swing
of
the
born
walker
we
kept
on
in
this
fashion
till
we
arrived
at
a
rusty
iron
gate
leading
by
means
of
a
weed-covered
path
to
a
low
two-storied
white
house
here
the
figures
left
us
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
vanished
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
wall
this
is
the
house
mr
baldwin
panted
pulling
up
with
the
greatest
difficulty
the
horse
evincing
obvious
antipathy
to
the
iron
gate
and
these
are
the
keys
i'm
afraid
you
must
go
in
alone
as
i
dare
not
leave
the
animal
even
for
a
minute
oh
all
right
i
said
i
don't
mind
now
that
the
ghost
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
has
gone
i'm
myself
again
i
jumped
down
and
threading
my
way
along
the
bramble-entangled
path
reached
the
front
door
on
opening
it
i
hesitated
the
big
old-fashioned
hall
with
the
great
frowning
staircase
leading
to
the
gallery
overhead
the
many
open
doors
showing
nought
but
bare
deserted
boards
within
the
grim
passages
all
moonlit
and
peopled
only
with
queer
flickering
shadows
suggested
much
that
was
terrifying
i
fancied
i
heard
noises
noises
like
stealthy
footsteps
moving
from
room
to
room
and
tiptoeing
along
the
passages
and
down
the
staircase
once
my
heart
almost
stopped
beating
as
i
saw
what
at
first
i
took
to
be
a
white
face
peering
at
me
from
a
far
recess
but
which
i
eventually
discovered
was
only
a
daub
of
whitewash
and
once
again
my
hair
all
but
rose
on
end
when
one
of
the
doors
at
which
i
was
looking
swung
open
and
something
came
forth
oh
the
horror
of
that
moment
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
never
forget
it
the
something
was
a
cat
just
a
rather
lean
but
otherwise
material
black
tom
yet
in
the
state
my
nerves
were
then
it
created
almost
as
much
horror
as
if
it
had
been
a
ghost
of
course
it
was
the
figure
of
the
walking
man
that
was
the
cause
of
all
this
nervousness
had
it
not
appeared
to
me
i
should
doubtless
have
entered
the
house
with
the
utmost
sang-froid
my
mind
set
on
nothing
but
the
condition
of
the
walls
drains
etc
as
it
was
i
held
back
and
it
was
only
after
a
severe
mental
struggle
i
summoned
up
the
courage
to
leave
the
doorway
and
explore
cautiously
very
cautiously
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
i
moved
from
room
to
room
halting
every
now
and
then
in
dreadful
suspense
as
the
wind
soughing
through
across
the
open
land
behind
the
house
blew
down
the
chimneys
and
set
the
window-frames
jarring
at
the
commencement
of
one
of
the
passages
i
was
immeasurably
startled
to
see
a
dark
shape
poke
forward
and
then
spring
hurriedly
back
and
was
so
frightened
that
i
dared
not
advance
to
see
what
it
was
moment
after
moment
sped
by
and
i
still
stood
there
the
cold
sweat
oozing
out
all
over
me
and
my
eyes
fixed
in
hideous
expectation
on
the
blank
wall
what
was
it
what
was
hiding
there
would
it
spring
out
on
me
if
i
went
to
see
at
last
urged
on
by
a
fascination
i
found
impossible
to
resist
i
crept
down
the
passage
my
heart
throbbing
painfully
and
my
whole
being
overcome
with
the
most
sickly
anticipations
as
i
drew
nearer
to
the
spot
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
breathe
and
my
respiration
came
in
quick
jerks
and
gasps
six
five
four
two
feet
and
i
was
at
the
dreaded
angle
another
step--taken
after
the
most
prodigious
battle--and--nothing
sprang
out
on
me
i
was
confronted
only
with
a
large
piece
of
paper
that
had
come
loose
from
the
wall
and
flapped
backwards
and
forwards
each
time
the
breeze
from
without
rustled
past
it
the
reaction
after
such
an
agony
of
suspense
was
so
great
that
i
leaned
against
the
wall
and
laughed
till
i
cried
a
noise
from
somewhere
away
in
the
basement
calling
me
to
myself
i
went
downstairs
and
investigated
again
a
shock--this
time
more
sudden
more
acute
pressed
against
the
window-pane
of
one
of
the
front
reception-rooms
was
the
face
of
a
man--with
corpse-like
cheeks
and
pale
malevolent
eyes
i
was
petrified--every
drop
of
my
blood
was
congealed
my
tongue
glued
to
my
mouth
my
arms
hung
helpless
i
stood
in
the
doorway
and
stared
at
it
this
went
on
for
what
seemed
to
me
an
eternity
then
came
a
revelation
the
face
was
not
that
of
a
ghost
but
of
mr
baldwin
who
getting
alarmed
at
my
long
absence
had
come
to
look
for
me
we
left
the
premises
together
all
the
way
back
to
the
town
i
thought--should
i
or
should
i
not
take
the
house
seen
as
i
had
seen
it
it
was
a
ghoulish-looking
place--as
weird
as
a
paris
catacomb--but
then
daylight
makes
all
the
difference
viewed
in
the
sunshine
it
would
be
just
like
any
other
house--plain
bricks
and
mortar
i
liked
the
situation
it
was
just
far
enough
away
from
a
town
to
enable
me
to
escape
all
the
smoke
and
traffic
and
near
enough
to
make
shopping
easy
the
only
obstacles
were
the
shadows--the
strange
enigmatical
shadows
i
had
seen
in
the
hall
and
passages
and
the
figure
of
the
walker
dare
i
take
a
house
that
knew
such
visitors
at
first
i
said
no
and
then
yes
something
i
could
not
tell
what
urged
me
to
say
yes
i
felt
that
a
very
grave
issue
was
at
stake--that
a
great
wrong
connected
in
some
manner
with
the
mysterious
figure
awaited
righting
and
that
the
hand
of
fate
pointed
at
me
as
the
one
and
only
person
who
could
do
it
are
you
sure
the
house
isn't
haunted
i
demanded
as
we
slowly
rolled
away
from
the
iron
gate
and
i
leaned
back
in
my
seat
to
light
my
pipe
haunted
mr
baldwin
scoffed
why
i
thought
you
didn't
believe
in
ghosts--laughed
at
them
no
more
i
do
believe
in
them
i
retorted
but
i
have
children
and
we
know
how
imaginative
children
are
i
can't
undertake
to
stop
their
imaginations
no
but
you
can
tell
me
whether
anyone
else
has
imagined
anything
there
imagination
is
sometimes
very
infectious
as
far
as
i
know
then
no
leastways
i
have
not
heard
tell
of
it
who
was
the
last
tenant
mr
jeremiah
dance
why
did
he
leave
how
do
i
know
got
tired
of
being
there
i
suppose
how
long
was
he
there
nearly
three
years
where
is
he
now
that's
more
than
i
can
say
why
do
you
wish
to
know
why
i
repeated
because
it
is
more
satisfactory
to
me
to
hear
about
the
house
from
someone
who
has
lived
in
it
has
he
left
no
address
not
that
i
know
of
and
it's
more
than
two
years
since
he
was
here
what
the
house
has
been
empty
all
that
time
two
years
is
not
very
long
houses--even
town
houses--are
frequently
unoccupied
for
longer
than
that
i
think
you'll
like
it
i
did
not
speak
again
till
the
drive
was
over
and
we
drew
up
outside
the
landlord's
house
i
then
said
let
me
have
an
agreement
i've
made
up
my
mind
to
take
it
three
years
and
the
option
to
stay
on
that
was
just
like
me
whatever
i
did
i
did
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
a
mode
of
procedure
that
often
led
me
into
difficulties
a
month
later
and
my
wife
children
servants
and
i
were
all
ensconced
in
the
crow's
nest
that
was
in
the
beginning
of
october
well
the
month
passed
by
and
november
was
fairly
in
before
anything
remarkable
happened
it
then
came
about
in
this
fashion
jennie
my
eldest
child
a
self-willed
and
rather
bad-tempered
girl
of
about
twelve
evading
the
vigilance
of
her
mother
who
had
forbidden
her
to
go
out
as
she
had
a
cold
ran
to
the
gate
one
evening
to
see
if
i
was
anywhere
in
sight
though
barely
five
o'clock
the
moon
was
high
in
the
sky
and
the
shadows
of
the
big
trees
had
already
commenced
their
gambols
along
the
roadside
jennie
clambered
up
the
gate
as
children
do
and
peering
over
suddenly
espied
what
she
took
to
be
me
striding
towards
the
house
at
a
swinging
pace
and
followed
by
two
poodles
poppa
she
cried
how
cute
of
you
only
to
think
of
you
bringing
home
two
doggies
oh
poppa
naughty
poppa
what
will
mum
say
and
climbing
over
into
the
lane
at
imminent
danger
to
life
and
limb
she
tore
frantically
towards
the
figure
to
her
dismay
however
it
was
not
me
but
a
stranger
with
a
horribly
white
face
and
big
glassy
eyes
which
he
turned
down
at
her
and
stared
she
was
so
frightened
that
she
fainted
and
some
ten
minutes
later
i
found
her
lying
out
there
on
the
road
from
the
description
she
gave
me
of
the
man
and
dogs
i
felt
quite
certain
they
were
the
figures
i
had
seen
though
i
pretended
the
man
was
a
tramp
and
assured
her
she
would
never
see
him
again
a
week
passed
and
i
was
beginning
to
hope
nothing
would
happen
when
one
of
the
servants
gave
notice
to
leave
at
first
she
would
not
say
why
she
did
not
like
the
house
but
when
pressed
made
the
following
statement--
it's
haunted
mrs
b----
i
can
put
up
with
mice
and
beetles
but
not
with
ghosts
i've
had
a
queer
sensation
as
if
water
was
falling
down
my
spine
ever
since
i've
been
here
but
never
saw
anything
till
last
night
i
was
then
in
the
kitchen
getting
ready
to
go
to
bed
jane
and
emma
had
already
gone
up
and
i
was
preparing
to
follow
them
when
all
of
a
sudden
i
heard
footsteps
quick
and
heavy
cross
the
gravel
and
approach
the
window
'the
boss'
says
i
to
myself
'maybe
he's
forgot
the
key
and
can't
get
in
at
the
front
door'
well
i
went
to
the
window
and
was
about
to
throw
it
open
when
i
got
an
awful
shock
pressed
against
the
glass
looking
in
at
me
was
a
face--not
the
boss's
face
not
the
face
of
anyone
living
but
a
horrid
white
thing
with
a
drooping
mouth
and
wide-open
glassy
eyes
that
had
no
more
expression
in
them
than
a
pig
as
sure
as
i'm
standing
here
mrs
b----
it
was
the
face
of
a
corpse--the
face
of
a
man
that
had
died
no
natural
death
and
by
its
side
standing
on
their
hind-legs
and
staring
in
at
me
too
were
two
dogs
both
poodles--also
no
living
things
but
dead
horribly
dead
well
they
stared
at
me
all
three
of
them
for
perhaps
a
minute
certainly
not
less
and
then
vanished
that's
why
i'm
leaving
mrs
b----
my
heart
was
never
overstrong
i
always
suffered
with
palpitations
and
if
i
saw
those
heads
again
it
would
kill
me
after
this
my
wife
spoke
to
me
seriously
jack
she
said
are
you
sure
there's
nothing
in
it
i
don't
think
mary
would
leave
us
without
a
good
cause
and
the
description
of
what
she
saw
tallies
exactly
with
the
figure
that
frightened
jennie
jennie
assures
me
she
never
said
a
word
about
it
to
the
servants
they
can't
both
have
imagined
it
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
my
conscience
pricked
me
without
a
doubt
i
ought
to
have
told
my
wife
of
my
own
experience
in
the
lane
and
have
consulted
her
before
taking
the
house
supposing
she
or
any
of
the
children
should
die
of
fright
it
would
be
my
fault
i
should
never
forgive
myself
you've
something
on
your
mind
what
is
it
my
wife
demanded
i
hesitated
a
moment
or
two
and
then
told
her
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
was
one
i
do
not
care
to
recollect
but
when
it
was
over
and
she
had
had
her
say
it
was
decided
i
should
make
enquiries
and
see
if
there
was
any
possible
way
of
getting
rid
of
the
ghosts
with
this
end
in
view
i
drove
to
the
town
and
after
several
fruitless
efforts
was
at
length
introduced
to
a
mr
marsden
clerk
of
one
of
the
banks
who
in
reply
to
my
questions
said
well
mr
b----
it's
just
this
way
i
do
know
something
only--in
a
small
place
like
this--one
has
to
be
so
extra
careful
what
one
says
some
years
ago
a
mr
jeremiah
dance
occupied
the
crow's
nest
he
came
here
apparently
a
total
stranger
and
though
often
in
the
town
was
only
seen
in
the
company
of
one
person--his
landlord
mr
baldwin
with
whom--if
local
gossip
is
to
be
relied
on--he
appeared
to
be
on
terms
of
the
greatest
familiarity
indeed
they
were
seldom
apart
walked
about
the
lanes
arm-in-arm
visited
each
other's
houses
on
alternate
evenings
called
each
other
teddy
and
leslie
this
state
of
things
continued
for
nearly
three
years
and
then
people
suddenly
began
to
comment
on
the
fact
that
mr
dance
had
gone
or
at
least
was
no
longer
visible
an
errand-boy
returning
back
to
town
late
one
evening
swore
to
being
passed
on
the
way
by
a
trap
containing
mr
baldwin
and
mr
dance
who
were
speaking
in
very
loud
voices--just
as
if
they
were
having
a
violent
altercation
on
reaching
that
part
of
the
road
where
the
trees
are
thickest
overhead
the
lad
overtook
them
or
rather
mr
baldwin
preparing
to
mount
into
the
trap
mr
dance
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
from
that
day
to
this
nothing
has
ever
been
heard
of
him
as
none
of
his
friends
or
relations
came
forward
to
raise
enquiries
and
all
his
bills
were
paid--several
of
them
by
mr
baldwin--no
one
took
the
matter
up
mr
baldwin
pooh-poohed
the
errand-boy's
story
and
declared
that
on
the
night
in
question
he
had
been
alone
in
an
altogether
different
part
of
the
county
and
knew
nothing
whatever
of
mr
dance's
movements
further
than
that
he
had
recently
announced
his
intention
of
leaving
the
crow's
nest
before
the
expiration
of
the
three
years'
lease
he
had
not
the
remotest
idea
where
he
was
he
claimed
the
furniture
in
payment
of
the
rent
due
to
him
did
the
matter
end
there
i
asked
in
one
sense
of
the
word
yes--in
another
no
within
a
few
weeks
of
dance's
disappearance
rumours
got
afloat
that
his
ghost
had
been
seen
on
the
road
just
where
you
may
say
you
saw
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
i've
seen
it
myself--and
so
have
crowds
of
other
people
has
anyone
ever
spoken
to
it
yes--and
it
has
vanished
at
once
i
went
there
one
night
with
the
purpose
of
laying
it
but
on
its
appearing
suddenly
i
confess
i
was
so
startled
that
i
not
only
forgot
what
i
had
rehearsed
to
say
but
ran
home
without
uttering
as
much
as
a
word
and
what
are
your
deductions
of
the
case
the
same
as
everyone
else's
mr
marsden
whispered
only
like
everyone
else
i
dare
not
say
had
mr
dance
any
dogs
yes--two
poodles
of
which
much
to
mr
baldwin's
annoyance
everyone
noticed
this
he
used
to
make
the
most
ridiculous
fuss
humph
i
observed
that
settles
it
ghosts
and
to
think
i
never
believed
in
them
before
well
i
am
going
to
try
try
what
mr
marsden
said
a
note
of
alarm
in
his
voice
try
laying
it
i
have
an
idea
i
may
succeed
i
wish
you
luck
then
may
i
come
with
you
thanks
no
i
rejoined
i
would
rather
go
there
alone
i
said
this
in
a
well-lighted
room
with
the
hum
of
a
crowded
thoroughfare
in
my
ears
twenty
minutes
later
when
i
had
left
all
that
behind
and
was
fast
approaching
the
darkest
part
of
an
exceptionally
dark
road
i
wished
i
had
not
at
the
very
spot
where
i
had
previously
seen
the
figures
i
saw
them
now
they
suddenly
appeared
by
my
side
and
though
i
was
going
at
a
great
rate--for
the
horse
took
fright--they
kept
easy
pace
with
me
twice
i
essayed
to
speak
to
them
but
could
not
ejaculate
a
syllable
through
sheer
horror
and
it
was
only
by
nerving
myself
to
the
utmost
and
forcing
my
eyes
away
from
them
that
i
was
able
to
stick
to
my
seat
and
hold
on
to
the
reins
on
and
on
we
dashed
until
trees
road
sky
universe
were
obliterated
in
one
blinding
whirlwind
that
got
up
my
nostrils
choked
my
ears
and
deadened
me
to
everything
save
the
all-terrorizing
instinctive
knowledge
that
the
figures
by
my
side
were
still
there
stalking
along
as
quietly
and
leisurely
as
if
the
horse
had
been
going
at
a
snail's
pace
at
last
to
my
intense
relief--for
never
had
the
ride
seemed
longer--i
reached
the
crow's
nest
and
as
i
hurriedly
dismounted
from
the
trap
the
figures
shot
past
me
and
vanished
once
inside
the
house
and
in
the
bosom
of
my
family
where
all
was
light
and
laughter
courage
returned
and
i
upbraided
myself
bitterly
for
this
cowardice
i
confessed
to
my
wife
and
she
insisted
on
accompanying
me
the
following
afternoon
at
twilight
to
the
spot
where
the
ghost
appeared
to
originate
to
our
intense
dismay
we
had
not
been
there
more
than
three
or
four
minutes
before
dora
our
youngest
girl
a
pretty
sweet-tempered
child
of
eight
came
running
up
to
us
with
a
telegram
which
one
of
the
servants
had
asked
her
to
give
us
my
wife
snatching
it
from
her
and
reading
it
was
about
to
scold
her
severely
when
she
suddenly
paused
and
clutching
hold
of
the
child
with
one
hand
pointed
hysterically
at
something
on
one
side
of
her
with
the
other
i
looked
and
dora
looked
and
we
both
saw
standing
erect
and
staring
at
us
the
spare
figure
of
a
man
with
a
ghastly
white
face
and
dull
lifeless
eyes
clad
in
a
panama
hat
albert
coat
and
small
patent-leather
boots
beside
him
were
two
glossy--abnormally
glossy--poodles
i
tried
to
speak
but
as
before
was
too
frightened
to
articulate
a
sound
and
my
wife
was
in
the
same
plight
with
dora
however
it
was
otherwise
and
she
electrified
us
by
going
up
to
the
figure
and
exclaiming
who
are
you
you
must
feel
very
ill
to
look
so
white
tell
me
your
name
the
figure
made
no
reply
but
gliding
slowly
forward
moved
up
to
a
large
isolated
oak
and
pointing
with
the
index
finger
of
its
left
hand
at
the
trunk
of
the
tree
seemingly
sank
into
the
earth
and
vanished
from
view
for
some
seconds
everyone
was
silent
and
then
my
wife
exclaimed
jack
i
shouldn't
wonder
if
dora
hasn't
been
the
means
of
solving
the
mystery
examine
the
tree
closely
i
did
so
the
tree
was
hollow
and
inside
it
were
three
skeletons





here
followed
an
extract
from
a
local
paper
sensational
discovery
in
a
wood
near
marytown
whilst
exploring
in
a
wood
near
marytown
the
other
evening
a
party
of
the
name
of
b----
discovered
three
skeletons--a
human
being
and
two
dogs--in
the
trunk
of
an
oak
from
the
remnant
of
clothes
still
adhering
to
the
human
remains
the
latter
were
proved
to
be
those
of
an
individual
known
as
mr
jeremiah
dance
whose
strange
disappearance
from
the
crow's
nest--the
house
he
rented
in
the
neighbourhood--some
two
years
ago
was
the
occasion
of
much
comment
on
closer
examination
extraordinary
to
relate
the
remains
have
been
proved
to
be
those
of
a
woman
and
from
certain
abrasions
on
the
skull
there
is
little
doubt
she
met
with
a
violent
end
a
second
extract
taken
from
the
same
paper
runs
thus--
suicide
at
marytown
late
last
night
percy
baldwin
the
man
who
is
under
arrest
on
suspicion
of
having
caused
the
death
of
the
unknown
woman
whose
skeleton
was
found
on
monday
in
the
trunk
of
a
tree
committed
suicide
by
hanging
himself
with
his
suspenders
to
the
ceiling
of
his
cell
pinned
on
his
coat
was
a
slip
of
paper
bearing
these
words
'she
was
my
wife--i
loved
her
she
took
to
drink--i
parted
from
her
she
became
a
dog-worshipper
i
killed
her--and
her
dogs'
phantasms
of
living
dogs
i
could
quote
innumerable
cases
of
people
who
have
either
seen
or
heard
the
spirits
of
dead
dogs
however
as
space
does
not
permit
of
this
i
proceed
to
the
oft-raised
question
do
animals
as
well
as
people
project
themselves
my
reply
is--yes
according
to
my
experience
they
do
some
friends
of
mine
have
a
big
tabby
that
has
frequently
been
seen
in
two
places
at
the
same
time
for
example
it
has
been
observed
by
several
people
to
be
sitting
on
a
chair
in
the
dining-room
and
at
the
same
moment
it
has
been
seen
by
two
or
more
other
persons
extended
at
full
length
before
the
kitchen
fire--the
latter
figure
proving
to
be
its
immaterial
or
what
some
designate
its
astral
body
which
vanishes
the
instant
an
attempt
is
made
to
touch
it
the
only
explanation
of
this
phenomenon
seems
to
me
to
lie
in
projection--the
cat
possessing
the
faculty
of
separating--in
this
instance
unconsciously--its
spiritual
from
its
physical
body--the
former
travelling
anywhere
regardless
of
space
time
and
material
obstacles
i
have
often
had
experiences
similar
to
this
with
a
friend's
dog
i
have
been
seated
in
a
room
either
reading
or
writing
and
on
looking
up
have
distinctly
seen
the
dog
lying
on
the
carpet
in
front
of
me
a
few
minutes
later
a
scraping
at
the
door
or
window--both
of
which
have
been
shut
all
the
while--and
on
my
rising
to
see
what
was
there
i
have
discovered
the
dog
outside
had
i
not
been
so
positive
i
had
seen
the
dog
on
the
ground
in
front
of
me
i
might
have
thought
it
was
an
hallucination
but
hallucinations
are
never
so
vivid
nor
so
lasting--moreover
other
people
have
had
similar
experiences
with
the
same
dog
and
why
not
dogs
on
the
whole
are
every
whit
as
reasoning
and
reflective
as
the
bulk
of
human
beings
and
how
much
nobler
compare
for
a
moment
the
dogs
you
know--no
matter
whether
mastiffs
retrievers
dachshunds
poodles
or
even
pekinese
with
your
acquaintances--with
the
people
you
see
everywhere
around
you--false
greedy
spiteful
scandal-loving
women
money-grubbing
attorneys
lying
swindling
tradesmen
vulgar
parvenus
finicky
curates
brutal
roughs
spoilt
cruel
children
hypocrites
of
both
sexes--compare
them
carefully--and
the
comparison
is
entirely
in
favour
of
the
dog
and
if
the
creating
power
or
powers
has
favoured
these
wholly
selfish
and
degenerate
human
beings
with
spirits
and
has
conferred
on
certain
of
them
the
faculty
of
projecting
those
spirits
can
one
imagine
for
one
moment
that
similar
gifts
have
been
denied
to
dogs--their
superiors
in
every
respect
pshaw
out
upon
it
to
think
so
would
mean
to
think
the
unthinkable
to
attribute
to
god
qualities
of
partiality
injustice
and
whimsicality
which
would
render
him
little
if
anything
better
than
a
james
the
second
of
england
or
a
louis
the
fifteenth
of
france
besides
from
my
own
experience
and
the
experiences
of
those
with
whom
i
have
been
brought
in
contact
i
can
safely
affirm
that
there
are
phantasms
and
therefore
spirits
of
both
living
and
dead
dogs
in
just
the
same
proportion
as
there
are
phantasms
and
therefore
spirits
of
both
living
and
dead
human
beings
psychic
properties
of
dogs
some
not
all
dogs--like
cats--possess
the
psychic
property
of
scenting
the
advent
of
death
and
they
indicate
their
fear
of
it
by
the
most
dismal
howling
in
my
opinion
there
is
very
little
doubt
that
dogs
actually
see
some
kind
of
phantasm
that
knowing
when
death
is
about
to
take
place
visits
the
house
of
the
doomed
and
stands
beside
his
or
her
couch
i
have
had
this
phantasm
described
to
me
by
those
who
declare
they
have
seen
it
as
a
very
tall
hooded
figure
clad
in
a
dark
loose
flowing
costume--its
face
never
discernible
it
would
of
course
be
foolish
to
say
that
a
dog
howling
in
a
house
is
invariably
the
sign
of
death
there
are
many
other
and
obvious
causes
which
produce
something
of
a
similar
effect
but
i
think
one
may
be
pretty
well
assured
that
when
the
howling
is
accompanied
by
unmistakable
signs
of
terror
then
someone
either
in
the
house
at
the
time
or
connected
with
someone
in
the
house
will
shortly
die
dogs
in
haunted
houses
when
i
investigate
a
haunted
house
i
generally
take
a
dog
with
me
because
experience
has
taught
me
that
a
dog
seldom
fails
to
give
notice
in
some
way
or
another--either
by
whining
or
growling
or
crouching
shivering
at
one's
feet
or
springing
on
one's
lap
and
trying
to
bury
its
head
in
one's
coat--of
the
proximity
of
a
ghost
i
had
a
dog
with
me
when
ghost-hunting
not
so
very
long
ago
in
a
well-known
haunted
house
in
gloucestershire
the
dog--my
only
companion--and
i
sat
on
the
staircase
leading
from
the
hall
to
the
first
floor
just
about
two
o'clock
the
dog
gave
a
loud
growl
i
put
my
hand
out
and
found
it
was
shivering
from
head
to
foot
almost
directly
afterwards
i
heard
the
loud
clatter
of
fire-irons
from
somewhere
away
in
the
basement
a
door
banged
and
then
something
or
someone
began
to
ascend
the
stairs
up
up
up
came
the
footsteps
until
i
could
see--first
of
all
a
bluish
light
then
the
top
of
a
head
then
a
face
white
and
luminous
staring
up
at
me
a
few
more
steps
and
the
whole
thing
was
disclosed
to
view
it
was
the
figure
of
a
girl
of
about
sixteen
with
a
shock
head
of
red
hair
on
which
was
stuck
all
awry
a
dirty
little
old-fashioned
servant's
cap
she
was
clad
in
a
cotton
dress
soiled
and
bedraggled
and
had
on
her
feet
a
pair
of
elastic-sided
boots
that
looked
as
if
they
would
fall
to
pieces
each
step
she
took
but
it
was
her
face
that
riveted
my
attention
most
it
was
startlingly
white
and
full
of
an
expression
of
the
most
hopeless
misery
the
eyes
wide
open
and
glassy
were
turned
direct
on
mine
i
was
too
appalled
either
to
stir
or
utter
a
sound
the
phantasm
came
right
up
to
where
i
stood
paused
for
a
second
and
then
slowly
went
on
up
up
up
until
a
sudden
bend
in
the
staircase
hid
it
from
view
for
some
seconds
there
was
a
continuation
of
the
footsteps
then
there
came
a
loud
splash
from
somewhere
outside
and
below--and
then
silence--sepulchral
and
omnipotent
i
did
not
wait
to
see
if
anything
further
would
happen
i
fled
and
dick
my
dog
friend
who
was
apparently
even
more
frightened
than
i
fled
with
me
we
arrived
home--panic-stricken
over
and
over
again
on
similar
occasions
i
have
had
a
dog
with
me
and
the
same
thing
has
occurred--the
dog
has
made
some
noise
indicative
of
great
fear
remaining
in
a
state
of
stupor
during
the
actual
presence
of
the
apparition
psychic
propensities
of
dogs
compared
with
those
of
cats
though
dogs
are
perhaps
rather
more
alarmed
at
the
unknown
than
cats
i
do
not
think
they
have
a
keener
sense
of
its
proximity
still
for
the
very
reason
that
they
show
greater--more
unmistakable--indications
of
fear
they
make
surer
psychic
barometers
the
psychic
faculty
of
scent
in
dogs
would
seem
to
be
more
limited
than
that
in
cats
for
whereas
cats
can
not
only
detect
the
advent
and
presence
of
pleasant
and
unpleasant
phantoms
by
their
smells
few
dogs
can
do
more
than
detect
the
approach
of
death
dogs
make
friends
nearly
if
not
quite
as
readily
with
cruel
and
brutal
people
as
with
kind
ones
simply
because
they
cannot
so
easily
as
cats
distinguish
by
their
scent
the
unpleasant
types
of
spirits
cruel
and
brutal
people
attract
in
all
probability
they
are
not
even
aware
of
the
presence
of
such
spirits
it
would
seem
on
the
face
of
it
that
since
dogs
are
on
the
whole
of
a
gentler
disposition
than
cats
that
is
to
say
not
quite
so
cruel
and
savage
the
phantasms
of
dogs
would
be
less
likely
to
be
earth-bound
than
those
of
cats
but
then
one
must
take
into
consideration
the
other
qualities
of
the
two
animals
and
when
these
are
put
in
the
balance
one
may
find
little
to
choose--morally--between
the
cat
and
the
dog
anyhow
after
making
allowance
for
the
fact
that
many
more
cats
die
unnatural
deaths
than
dogs
there
would
seem
to
be
small
numerical
difference
in
their
hauntings--cases
of
dog
ghosts
appearing
to
be
just
as
common
as
cases
of
cat
ghosts
apropos
of
phantom
dogs
my
friend
dr
g
west
writes
to
me
thus--
of
the
older
english
universities
many
stories
are
told
of
bizarre
happenings--of
duels
raggings
suicides
and
such-like--in
olden
times
but
of
k
venerable
illustrious
k
of
ireland
few
and
far
between
are
the
accounts
of
similar
occurrences
this
is
one
however
and
it
deals
with
the
phantom
of
a
dog--
one
evening
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
john
kelly
a
dean
of
the
college
extremely
unpopular
on
account
of
his
supposed
harsh
treatment
of
some
of
the
undergraduates
was
about
to
commence
his
supper
when
he
heard
a
low
whine
and
looking
down
saw
a
large
yellow
dog
cross
the
floor
in
front
of
him
and
disappear
immediately
under
the
full-length
portrait
that
hung
over
the
antique
chimney-piece
something
prompting
him
he
glanced
at
the
picture
the
eyes
that
looked
into
his
blinked
'it
must
be
the
result
of
an
overtaxed
brain'
he
said
to
himself
'those
rascally
undergraduates
have
got
on
my
nerves'
he
shut
his
eyes
and
re-opening
them
stared
hard
at
the
portrait
it
was
not
a
delusion
the
eyes
that
gazed
back
at
him
were
alive--alive
with
the
spirit
of
mockery
they
smiled
laughed
jeered
and
as
they
did
so
the
knowledge
of
his
surroundings
was
brought
forcibly
home
to
him
the
room
in
which
he
was
seated
was
situated
at
the
end
of
a
long
cheerless
stone
passage
in
the
western
wing
of
the
college
away
from
all
the
other
rooms
of
the
building
it
was
absolutely
isolated
and
had
long
borne
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
by
a
dog
which
was
said
to
appear
only
before
some
catastrophe
the
dean
had
hitherto
committed
the
story
to
the
category
of
fables
but
now--now
as
he
sat
all
alone
in
that
big
silent
room
lit
only
with
the
reddish
rays
of
a
fast-setting
august
sun
and
stared
into
the
gleaming
eyes
before
him--he
was
obliged
to
admit
the
extreme
probability
of
spookdom
never
before
had
the
college
seemed
so
quiet
not
a
sound--not
even
the
creaking
of
a
board
or
the
far-away
laugh
of
a
student
common
enough
noises
on
most
nights--fell
on
his
ears
the
hush
was
omnipotent
depressing
unnerving
he
could
only
associate
it
with
the
supernatural
though
he
was
too
fascinated
to
remove
his
gaze
from
the
thing
before
him
he
could
feel
the
room
fill
with
shadows
and
feel
them
steal
through
the
half-open
windows
and
uniting
with
those
already
in
the
corners
glide
noiselessly
and
surreptitiously
towards
him
he
felt
too
that
he
was
under
the
surveillance
of
countless
invisible
visages
all
scanning
him
curiously
and
delighted
beyond
measure
at
the
sight
of
his
terror
the
moments
passed
in
a
breathless
state
of
tension
he
stared
at
the
eyes
and
the
eyes
stared
back
at
him
once
he
endeavoured
to
rise
but
a
dead
weight
seemed
to
fall
on
his
shoulders
and
hold
him
back
and
twice
when
he
tried
to
speak--to
make
some
sound
no
matter
what
to
break
the
appalling
silence--his
throat
closed
as
if
under
the
pressure
of
cruel
relentless
fingers
but
the
ultima
thule
of
his
emotions
had
yet
to
come
there
was
a
slight
stir
behind
the
canvas
a
thud
a
hollow
groan
that
echoed
and
re-echoed
throughout
the
room
like
the
muffled
clap
of
distant
thunder
and
the
eyes
suddenly
underwent
a
metamorphosis--they
grew
glazed
and
glassy
like
the
eyes
of
a
dead
person
a
cold
shudder
ran
through
the
dean
his
hair
stood
on
end
his
blood
turned
to
ice
again
he
essayed
to
move
to
summon
help
again
he
failed
the
strain
on
his
nerves
proved
more
than
he
could
bear
a
sudden
sensation
of
nausea
surged
through
him
his
eyes
swam
his
brain
reeled
there
was
a
loud
buzzing
in
his
ears
he
knew
no
more
some
moments
later
one
of
the
college
servants
arrived
at
the
door
with
a
bundle
of
letters
and
on
receiving
no
reply
to
his
raps
entered
'good
heavens
what's
the
matter'
he
cried
gazing
at
the
figure
of
the
dean
lolling
head
downward
on
the
table
'merciful
prudence
the
gentleman
is
dead
no
he
ain't--some
of
the
young
gents
will
be
sorry
enough
for
that--he's
fainted'
the
good
fellow
poured
out
some
water
in
a
tumbler
and
was
proceeding
to
sprinkle
the
dean's
face
with
it
when
a
noise
attracting
his
attention
he
peered
round
at
the
picture
it
was
bulging
from
the
wall
it
was
falling
and
good
god
what
was
that
that
was
falling
with
it--that
huge
black
object
a
coffin
no
not
a
coffin
but
a
corpse
the
servant
ran
to
the
door
shrieking
and
in
less
than
a
minute
passage
and
room
were
filled
to
overflowing
with
a
scared
crowd
of
enquiring
officials
and
undergraduates
'what
has
happened
what's
the
matter
with
the
dean
has
he
had
a
fit
or
what
and
the
picture
and--anderson
anderson
lying
on
the
floor
hurt
no
not
hurt
dead
murdered'
in
an
instant
there
was
silence
and
the
white-faced
throng
closed
in
on
one
another
as
if
for
protection
in
front
of
them
beside
the
fallen
picture
lay
the
body
of
the
most
gay
and
popular
student
in
the
college--bob
anderson--bob
anderson
with
a
stream
of
blood
running
from
a
deep
incision
in
his
back
made
with
some
sharp
instrument
that
had
been
driven
home
with
tremendous
force
he
had
without
doubt
been
murdered
but
by
whom
then
one
of
the
undergraduates
a
bright
boyish
fair-haired
giant
named
o'farroll
immensely
popular
both
on
account
of
his
prowess
in
sport
and
an
untold
number
of
the
most
audacious
escapades
spoke
out
'i
saw
anderson
about
an
hour
ago
crossing
the
quadrangle
i
asked
him
where
he
was
going
and
he
replied
to
old
kelly
i
intend
paying
him
out
for
'gating'
me
last
week
i
enquired
how
and
he
replied
i've
a
glorious
plan
you
know
that
portrait
stuck
over
his
mantel-shelf
well
in
poking
about
the
room
the
other
day
when
the
old
man
was
out
i
had
a
great
find
directly
behind
the
picture
is
the
door
of
a
secret
room
so
neatly
covered
by
the
designs
on
the
wall
that
it
is
not
discernible
it
was
only
by
the
merest
fluke
i
discovered
it
i
was
taking
down
the
picture
with
the
idea
of
touching
up
the
face
when
my
knuckles
bumped
against
the
panels
of
the
wall
touched
a
spring
and
the
door
flew
open
revealing
an
apartment
about
six
by
eight
feet
large
i
at
once
explored
it
and
found
it
could
be
entered
by
the
chimney
an
idea
then
struck
me--i
would
play
a
trick
upon
the
dean
by
hiding
in
this
secret
chamber
one
evening
while
he
was
feeding
cutting
out
the
eyes
of
the
portrait
and
peering
through
the
cavities
at
him
and
this'
o'farroll
continued
pointing
at
the
fallen
picture
'is
what
he
evidently
did
after
i
left
him
you
can
see
the
eyes
of
the
portrait
have
been
removed'
'that
is
so
shure'
one
of
the
other
undergraduates
mick
maguire--six
feet
two
in
his
socks
every
inch--exclaimed
'and
what
is
more
i
knew
all
about
it
anderson
told
me
yesterday
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
i
wanted
to
join
him
but
he
said
i
would
never
get
up
the
chimney
i
would
stick
there
and
bedad
i
think
he
was
right'
at
this
remark
despite
the
grimness
of
the
moment
several
of
those
present
laughed
'come
come
gentlemen'
one
of
the
officials
cried
'this
is
no
time
for
levity
mr
anderson
has
been
murdered
and
the
question
is--by
whom'
'then
if
that's
the
only
thing
that
is
troubling
you'
o'farroll
put
in
'i
fancy
the
solution
is
right
here
at
hand'
and
he
looked
significantly
at
the
dean
an
ominous
silence
followed
during
which
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
john
kelly
some
anxiously
some
merely
enquiringly
but
not
a
few
angrily
for
kelly
as
i
have
said
before
had
made
himself
particularly
obnoxious
just
then
by
his
behaviour
to
the
rowdier
students
and
as
has
ever
been
the
case
at
k
these
formed
no
small
portion
of
the
community
the
dean
hardly
seemed
to
realize
the
situation
the
dignity
of
office
blinded
him
to
danger
'what
do
you
mean'
he
spluttered
'i
know
nothing
of
what
happened
to
mr
anderson
really
really
o'farroll
your
presumption
is
preposterous'
'there
was
no
one
else
in
here
but
you
and
he
mr
kelly'
o'farroll
retorted
coolly
'it's
only
natural
we
should
think
you
know
something
of
what
happened'
on
the
arrival
of
the
police
who
had
been
sent
for
somewhat
reluctantly--for
the
prestige
of
the
college
at
that
date
was
very
dear
to
all--the
premises
were
thoroughly
searched
and
no
other
culprit
being
found
first
of
all
dean
kelly
was
apprehended
and
then
to
make
a
good
job
of
it
his
accuser
denis
o'farroll
all
the
college
was
agog
with
excitement
no
one
could
believe
the
dean
was
a
murderer
and
it
was
just
as
inconceivable
to
think
o'farroll
had
committed
the
deed
and
yet
if
neither
of
them
had
killed
anderson
who
in
god's
name
had
killed
him
the
night
succeeding
the
affair
whilst
the
dean
and
o'farroll
were
still
in
jail
awaiting
the
inquest
a
party
of
undergraduates
were
discussing
the
situation
in
maguire's
rooms
when
the
door
burst
open
and
into
their
midst
almost
breathless
with
excitement
came
a
measly
bespectacled
youth
named
brady--patrick
brady
'i'm
awfully
sorry
to
disturb
you
fellows'
he
stammered
'but
there
have
been
odd
noises
just
outside
my
room
all
the
evening
and
i've
just
seen
a
queer
kind
of
dog
that
vanished
god
knows
how
i--i--well
you
will
call
me
an
ass
of
course
but
i'm
afraid
to
stay
there
alone
and
that's
the
long
and
short
of
it'
'begorra'
maguire
exclaimed
'it
can't
be
poor
bob's
ghost
already
what
sort
of
noises
were
they'
'noises
like
laughter'
brady
said
'loud
peals
of
horrid
laughter'
'someone
trying
to
frighten
you'
one
of
the
undergrads
observed
'and
faith
he
succeeded
you
are
twice
as
white
as
any
sheet'
'it's
ill-timed
mirth
anyhow'
someone
else
put
in
'with
anderson's
dead
body
upstairs
i'm
for
making
an
example
of
the
blackguard'
'and
i'--'and
i'
the
others
echoed
a
general
movement
followed
and
headed
by
brady
the
procession
moved
to
the
north
wing
of
the
college
at
that
time
be
it
remembered
a
large
proportion
of
k
undergrads
were
in
residence--now
it
is
otherwise
on
reaching
brady's
rooms
the
crowd
halted
outside
and
listened
for
some
time
there
was
silence
and
then
a
laugh--low
monotonous
unmirthful
metallic--coming
as
it
were
from
some
adjacent
chamber
and
so
unnatural
so
abhorring
that
it
held
everyone
spell-bound
it
died
away
in
the
reverberations
of
the
stone
corridor
its
echoes
seeming
to
awake
a
chorus
of
other
laughs
hardly
less
dreadful
again
there
was
silence
no
one
daring
to
express
his
thoughts
then
as
if
by
common
consent
all
turned
precipitately
into
brady's
room
and
slammed
the
door
'that
is
what
i
heard'
brady
said
'what
does
it
mean'
'is
it
the
meaning
of
it
you're
wanting
to
know'
maguire
observed
'sure
'tis
the
devil
for
no
one
but
him
could
make
such
a
noise
i've
never
heard
the
like
of
it
before
who
has
the
rooms
on
either
side
of
you'
'these'
brady
replied
pointing
to
the
right
'no
one
they
were
vacated
at
easter
and
are
being
repainted
and
decorated
these
on
the
left--dobson
who
is
i
happen
to
know
at
the
present
moment
in
co
mayo
he
won't
be
back
till
next
week'
'then
we
can
search
them'
a
student
called
hartnoll
intervened
'to
be
sure
we
can'
brady
replied
'but
i
doubt
if
you'll
find
anyone'
a
search
was
made
and
brady
proved
to
be
correct
not
a
vestige
of
anyone
was
discovered
much
mystified
maguire's
party
was
preparing
to
depart
when
hartnoll
who
had
taken
the
keenest
interest
in
the
proceedings
suddenly
said
'who
has
the
rooms
over
yours
brady
sound
as
you
know
plays
curious
tricks
and
it
is
just
as
likely
as
not
that
laugh
came
from
above'
'oh
i
don't
think
so'
brady
answered
'the
man
overhead
is
belton
a
very
decent
sort
he
is
going
in
for
his
finals
shortly
and
is
sweating
fearfully
hard
at
present
we
might
certainly
ask
him
if
he
heard
the
noise'
the
students
agreeing
brady
led
the
way
upstairs
and
in
response
to
their
summons
belton
hastily
opened
the
door
he
was
a
typical
book-worm--thin
pale
and
rather
emaciated
but
with
a
pleasant
expression
in
his
eyes
and
mouth
that
all
felt
was
assuring
'hulloa'
he
exclaimed
'it
isn't
often
i'm
favoured
with
a
surprise
party
of
this
sort
come
in'
and
he
pressed
them
so
hard
that
they
felt
constrained
to
accept
his
hospitality
and
before
long
were
all
seated
round
the
fire
quaffing
whisky
and
puffing
cigars
as
if
they
meant
to
make
a
night
of
it
at
two
o'clock
someone
suggested
that
it
was
high
time
they
thought
of
bed
and
belton
rose
with
them
'before
we
turn
in
let's
have
another
search'
he
said
'it's
strange
you
should
all
hear
that
noise
except
me--unless
of
course
it
came
from
below'
'but
there's
nothing
under
me'
brady
remarked
'except
the
dining
hall'
'then
let's
search
that'
belton
went
on
'we
ought
to
make
a
thorough
job
of
it
now
we've
once
begun
besides
i
don't
relish
being
in
this
lonely
place
with
that
laugh
knocking
around
any
more
than
you
do'
he
went
with
them
and
they
completely
overhauled
the
ground
floor--hall
dining-room
studies
passages
vestibules
everywhere
that
was
not
barred
to
them
but
they
were
no
wiser
at
the
end
of
their
search
than
at
the
beginning
there
was
not
the
slightest
clue
as
to
the
author
of
the
laugh





on
the
morrow
there
was
a
fresh
shock
one
of
the
college
servants
on
entering
mr
maguire's
rooms
to
call
him
found
that
gentleman
half
dressed
and
lying
on
the
floor
terrified
beyond
measure
the
servant
bent
over
him
and
discovered
he
was
dead
obviously
stabbed
with
the
same
weapon
that
had
put
an
end
to
bob
anderson
the
factotum
at
once
gave
the
alarm
everyone
in
the
college
came
trooping
to
the
room
and
for
the
second
time
within
three
days
a
general
hue
and
cry
was
raised
all
again
to
no
purpose--the
murderer
had
left
no
traces
as
to
his
identity
however
one
thing
at
least
was
established
and
that
was
the
innocence
of
dean
kelly
and
denis
o'farroll
they
were
both
liberated
then
hartnoll
who
seems
to
have
been
a
regular
sherlock
holmes
got
to
work
in
grim
earnest
on
the
floor
in
maguire's
room
he
picked
up
a
diminutive
silver-topped
pencil
which
had
rolled
under
the
fender
and
had
so
escaped
observation
he
asked
several
of
maguire's
most
intimate
friends
if
they
remembered
seeing
the
pencil-case
in
maguire's
possession
but
they
shook
their
heads
he
enquired
in
other
quarters
too
but
with
no
better
result
and
finally
resolved
to
ask
brady
who
belonged
to
quite
a
different
set
from
himself
with
that
object
in
view
he
set
off
to
brady's
room
shortly
after
supper
as
there
was
no
response
to
his
raps
he
at
length
opened
brady's
door
in
front
of
the
hearth
in
a
big
easy
chair
sat
a
figure
'brady
by
all
that's
holy'
hartnoll
exclaimed
'by
jupiter
the
beggar's
asleep
that's
what
comes
of
swotting
too
hard
brady'
approaching
the
chair
he
called
again
'brady'
and
getting
no
reply
patted
the
figure
gently
on
the
back
'be
jabbers
you
sleep
soundly
old
fellow'
he
said
'how
about
that'
and
he
shook
him
heartily
by
the
shoulder
the
instant
he
let
go
the
figure
collapsed
in
order
to
get
a
closer
view
hartnoll
then
struck
a
light
with
the
tinder
box
the
flickering
of
the
candle
flame
fell
on
brady's
face
it
was
white--ghastly
white
there
was
no
animation
in
it
the
jaw
dropped
with
a
cry
of
horror
hartnoll
sprang
back
and
as
he
did
so
a
great
yellow
dog
dashed
across
the
hearth
in
front
of
him
whilst
from
somewhere
close
at
hand
came
a
laugh--long
low
and
satirical
a
cold
terror
gripped
hartnoll
and
for
a
moment
or
so
he
was
on
the
verge
of
fainting
however
hearing
voices
in
the
quadrangle
he
pulled
himself
together
approached
the
window
on
tiptoe
and
peering
through
the
glass
perceived
to
his
utmost
joy
two
of
his
friends
directly
beneath
him
'i
say
you
fellows'
he
called
in
low
tones
'come
up
here
quickly--brady's
rooms
i've
seen
the
phantom
dog
there's
been
another
tragedy
and
the
murderer
is
close
at
hand
come
quietly
and
we
may
catch
him'
he
then
retraced
his
steps
to
the
centre
of
the
room
and
listened
again
there
came
the
laugh--subtle
protracted
hellish--and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
it
must
originate
in
the
room
overhead
a
noise
in
the
direction
of
the
hearth
made
him
look
round
some
loose
plaster
had
fallen
and
whilst
he
still
gazed
more
fell
the
truth
of
the
whole
thing
then
dawned
on
him
the
murderer
was
in
the
chimney
hartnoll
was
a
creature
of
impulse
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
he
forgot
danger
and
the
dastardly
nature
of
the
crimes
gave
him
more
than
his
usual
amount
of
courage
he
rushed
at
the
chimney
and
regardless
of
soot
and
darkness
began
an
impromptu
ascent
half-way
up
something
struck
him--once
twice
thrice--sharply
and
there
was
a
soft
malevolent
chuckle
at
this
juncture
the
two
undergraduates
arrived
in
brady's
room
no
one
was
there--nothing
save
a
hunched-up
figure
on
a
chair
'hartnoll'
they
whispered
'hartnoll'
no
reply
they
called
again--still
no
reply
again
and
again
they
called
until
at
length
through
sheer
fatigue
they
desisted
and
seized
with
a
sudden
panic
fled
precipitately
downstairs
and
out
into
the
quadrangle
once
more
the
alarm
was
given
and
once
again
the
whole
college
wild
with
excitement
hastened
to
the
scene
of
the
outrage
this
time
there
was
a
double
mystery
brady
had
been
murdered--hartnoll
had
disappeared
the
police
were
summoned
and
the
whole
building
ransacked
but
no
one
thought
of
the
chimney
till
the
search
was
nearly
over
and
half
the
throng--overcome
with
fatigue--had
retired
o'farroll
was
the
discoverer
happening
to
glance
at
the
hearth
he
saw
something
drop
'for
heaven's
sake
you
fellows'
he
shouted
'look
blood
you
may
take
it
from
me
there's
a
corpse
in
the
chimney'
a
dozen
candles
invaded
the
hearth
and
a
herculean
policeman
undertook
the
ascent
in
breathless
silence
the
crowd
below
waited
and
after
a
few
seconds
of
intense
suspense
two
helpless
legs
appeared
on
the
hob
bit
by
bit
the
rest
of
the
body
followed
until
at
length
the
whole
figure
of
hartnoll
black
bleeding
bloodstained
was
disclosed
to
view
at
first
it
was
thought
that
he
was
dead
but
the
surgeon
who
had
hurried
to
the
scene
pronouncing
him
still
alive
there
arose
a
tremendous
cheer
the
murderer
had
at
all
events
been
foiled
this
time
'begorrah'
cried
o'farroll
'hartnoll
was
after
the
murderer
when
he
was
struck
and
shure
i'll
be
after
him
the
same
way
myself'
and
before
anyone
could
prevent
him
o'farroll
was
up
the
chimney
up
up
up
until
he
found
himself
going
down
down
down
and
then--bedad--he
stepped
right
out
on
to
the
floor
of
belton's
room
'hulloa'
the
latter
exclaimed
looking
not
a
bit
disconcerted
'that's
a
curious
mode
of
making
your
entrance
into
my
domain
why
didn't
you
come
by
the
door'
'because'
o'farroll
replied
pointing
to
a
patch
of
soot
near
the
washstand
'i
followed
you
own
up
dicky
belton
you're
the
culprit--you
did
for
them
all'
and
belton
laughed





yes
it
was
true
overwork
had
turned
belton's
brain
and
he
was
subsequently
sent
to
a
criminal
lunatic
asylum
for
the
rest
of
his
life
but
there
were
moments
when
he
was
comparatively
sane
and
in
these
interims
he
confessed
everything
anderson
had
told
him
that
he
was
going
to
hoax
the
dean
and
filled
with
indignation
at
the
idea
of
such
a
trick
being
played
on
a
college
official--for
he
belton
was
a
great
favourite
with
the
'beaks'--he
had
accompanied
anderson
on
the
plea
of
helping
him
intending
in
reality
to
frustrate
him
it
was
not
till
he
was
in
the
chimney
crouching
behind
anderson
that
the
thought
of
killing
his
fellow-students
had
entered
his
mind
the
heat
of
his
hiding-place
acting
on
an
already
overworked
brain
hastened
on
the
madness
and
his
fingers
closing
on
a
clasped
knife
in
one
of
his
pockets
inspired
him
with
a
desire
to
kill
the
work
once
begun
he
had
argued
with
himself
would
have
to
be
continued
and
he
had
then
and
there
decided
that
all
unruly
undergraduates
should
be
exterminated
with
what
measure
of
success
this
determination
was
carried
out
need
not
be
recapitulated
here
but
with
regard
to
the
phantom
dog
a
few
words
may
be
added
since
it
appeared
immediately
before
the
committal
of
each
of
the
three
murders
i
have
just
recorded
it
was
seen
by
mr
kelly
before
the
death
of
bob
anderson
by
brady
before
the
murder
of
maguire
and
by
hartnoll
before
brady
was
murdered
i
think
there
can
neither
be
doubts
as
to
its
existence
nor
as
to
the
purport
of
its
visits
moreover
its
latest
appearance
in
the
university
reported
to
me
quite
recently
preceded
a
serious
outbreak
of
fire
national
ghosts
in
the
form
of
dogs
one
of
the
most
notorious
dog
ghosts
is
the
gwyllgi
in
wales
this
apparition
which
is
of
a
particularly
terrifying
appearance
chiefly
haunts
the
lane
leading
from
mousiad
to
lisworney
crossways
belief
in
a
spectral
dog
however
is
common
all
over
the
british
isles
the
apparition
does
not
belong
to
any
one
breed
but
appears
equally
often
as
a
hound
setter
terrier
shepherd
dog
newfoundland
and
retriever
in
lancashire
it
is
called
the
trash
or
striker
trash
because
the
sound
of
its
tread
is
thought
to
resemble
a
person
walking
along
a
miry
sloppy
road
with
heavy
shoes
striker
because
it
is
said
to
utter
a
curious
screech
which
may
be
taken
as
a
warning
of
the
approaching
death
of
some
relative
or
friend
when
followed
the
phantom
retreats
glaring
at
its
pursuer
and
either
sinks
into
the
ground
with
a
harrowing
shriek
or
disappears
in
some
equally
mysterious
manner
in
norfolk
and
cambridgeshire
this
spectre
is
named
the
shuck
the
local
name
for
shag--and
is
reported
to
haunt
churchyards
and
other
dreary
spots
in
the
parish
of
overstrand
there
used
to
be
a
lane
called
shuck's
lane
named
after
this
phantasm
round
about
leeds
the
spectre
dog
is
called
padfoot
and
is
about
the
size
of
a
donkey
with
shaggy
hair
and
large
eyes
like
saucers
my
friend
mr
barker
tells
me
there
was
at
one
time
a
ghost
in
the
hebrides
called
the
lamper
which
was
like
a
very
big
white
dog
with
no
tail
it
ran
sometimes
straight
ahead
but
usually
in
circles
and
to
see
it
was
a
prognostication
of
death
mr
barker
going
home
by
the
sea-coast
saw
the
lamper
in
the
hedge
he
struck
at
it
and
his
stick
passed
right
through
it
the
lamper
rushed
away
whining
and
howling
alternately
and
disappeared
mr
barker
was
so
scared
that
he
ran
all
the
way
home
on
the
morrow
he
learned
of
his
father's
death
in
northumberland
durham
and
various
parts
of
yorkshire
the
ghost-dog
which
is
firmly
believed
in
is
styled
barguest
bahrgeist
or
boguest
whilst
in
lancashire
it
is
termed
the
boggart
its
most
common
form
in
these
counties
is
a
large
black
dog
with
flaming
eyes
and
its
appearance
is
a
certain
prognostication
of
death
according
to
tradition
there
was
once
a
barguest
in
a
glen
between
darlington
and
houghton
near
throstlenest
another
haunted
a
piece
of
waste
land
above
a
spring
called
the
oxwells
between
wreghorn
and
headingley
hill
near
leeds
on
the
death
of
any
person
of
local
importance
in
the
neighbourhood
the
creature
would
come
forth
followed
by
all
the
other
dogs
barking
and
howling
henderson
refers
to
these
hauntings
in
his
folk-lore
of
northern
counties
another
form
of
this
animal
spectre
is
the
capelthwaite
which
according
to
common
report
had
the
power
of
appearing
in
the
form
of
any
quadruped
but
usually
chose
that
of
a
large
black
dog
the
mauthe
doog
one
of
the
most
famous
canine
apparitions
is
that
of
the
mauthe
doog
once
said--and
i
believe
still
said--to
haunt
peel
castle
isle
of
man
its
favourite
place
so
i
am
told
was
the
guard-chamber
where
it
used
to
crouch
by
the
fireside
the
sentry
so
the
story
runs
got
so
accustomed
to
seeing
it
that
they
ceased
to
be
afraid
but
as
they
believed
it
to
be
of
evil
origin
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
seize
them
they
were
very
particular
what
they
said
or
did
and
refrained
from
swearing
in
its
presence
the
mauthe
doog
used
to
come
out
and
return
by
the
passage
through
the
church
by
which
the
sentry
on
duty
had
to
go
to
deliver
the
keys
every
night
to
the
captain
these
men
however
were
far
too
nervous
to
go
alone
and
were
invariably
accompanied
by
one
of
the
retainers
on
one
occasion
however
one
of
the
sentinels
in
a
fit
of
drunken
bravado
swore
he
was
afraid
of
nothing
and
insisted
on
going
alone
his
comrades
tried
to
dissuade
him
upon
which
he
became
abusive
cursed
the
mauthe
doog
and
said
he
would
d----d
well
strike
it
an
hour
later
he
returned
absolutely
mad
with
horror
and
speechless
nor
could
he
even
make
signs
whereby
his
friends
could
understand
what
had
happened
to
him
he
died
soon
after--his
features
distorted--in
violent
agony
after
this
the
apparition
was
never
seen
again
as
to
what
class
of
spirits
the
spectre
dog
belongs
that
is
impossible
to
say
at
the
most
we
can
only
surmise
and
i
should
think
the
chances
of
its
being
the
actual
phantasm
of
some
dead
dog
or
an
elemental
are
about
equal
it
is
probably
sometimes
the
one
and
sometimes
the
other
and
its
origin
is
very
possibly
like
that
of
the
banshee
spectral
hounds
as
with
the
spectre
dog
so
with
packs
of
hounds
stories
of
them
come
from
all
parts
of
the
country
gervase
of
tilbury
states
that
as
long
ago
as
the
thirteenth
century
a
pack
of
spectral
hounds
was
frequently
witnessed
on
nights
when
the
moon
was
full
scampering
across
forest
and
downs
in
the
twelfth
century
the
pack
was
known
as
the
herlething
and
haunted
chiefly
the
banks
of
the
wye
roby
in
his
traditions
of
lancashire
hardwick
in
his
traditions
superstitions
and
folk-lore
homerton
in
his
isles
of
loch
awe
wirt
sykes
in
his
british
goblins
sir
walter
scott
and
others
all
refer
to
them
in
the
north
of
england
they
are
known
as
gabriel's
hounds
in
devon
as
the
wisk
yesk
yeth
or
heath
hounds
in
wales
as
the
cwn
annwn
or
cyn
y
wybr
in
cornwall
as
the
devil
and
his
dandy-dogs
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
leeds
as
the
gabble
retchets
they
are
common
all
over
the
continent
in
appearance
they
are
usually
described
as
monstrous
human-headed
dogs
black
with
fiery
eyes
and
teeth
and
sprinkled
all
over
with
blood
they
make
a
great
howling
noise
which
is
very
shrill
and
mournful
and
appear
to
be
in
hot
pursuit
of
some
unseen
quarry
when
they
approach
a
house
it
may
be
taken
as
a
certain
sign
someone
in
that
house
will
die
very
shortly
according
to
mr
roby
a
spectre
huntsman
known
by
the
name
gabriel
ratchets
accompanied
by
a
pack
of
phantom
hounds
is
said
to
hunt
a
milk-white
doe
round
the
eagle's
crag
in
the
vale
of
todmorden
every
all
hallows
eve
these
hounds
were
also
seen
in
norfolk
a
famous
ecclesiast
when
on
his
way
to
the
coast
was
forced
to
spend
the
night
in
the
king's
lynn
inn
owing
to
a
violent
snowstorm
retiring
to
bed
directly
after
supper
he
tried
to
forget
his
disappointment
in
reading
a
volume
of
sermons
he
had
bought
at
a
second-hand
shop
in
bury
st
edmunds
i
think
i
can
use
this
one
he
said
to
himself
it
will
do
nicely
for
the
people
of
aylesham
they
are
so
steeped
in
hypocrisy
that
nothing
short
of
violent
denunciation
will
bring
it
home
to
them
this
i
think
however
will
pierce
even
their
skins
a
sudden
noise
made
him
spring
up
hounds
he
exclaimed
and
at
this
time
of
night
good
heavens
he
flew
to
the
window
and
there
careering
through
the
yard
baying
as
they
ran
were
at
least
fifty
luminous
white
hounds
instead
of
leaping
the
stone
wall
they
passed
right
through
it
and
the
bishop
then
realized
that
they
were
gabriel
hounds
the
following
evening
he
received
tidings
of
his
son's--his
only
son's--death
i
have
heard
that
the
yeth
hounds
were
seen
not
so
long
ago
in
a
parish
in
yorkshire
by
an
old
poacher
called
barnes
barnes
was
walking
in
the
fields
one
night
when
he
suddenly
heard
the
baying
of
the
hounds
and
the
hoarse
shouts
of
the
huntsman
the
next
moment
the
whole
pack
hove
in
view
and
tore
past
him
so
close
that
he
received
a
cut
from
the
whip
on
his
leg
to
his
surprise
however
it
did
not
hurt
him
it
only
felt
icy
cold
he
then
knew
that
he
had
seen
the
yeth
hounds
a
spectral
pack
of
hounds
in
russia
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
rappaport
whom
i
once
met
in
southampton
told
me
of
an
experience
he
had
once
had
with
a
spectral
pack
of
hounds
on
the
slope
of
the
urals
it
was
about
half-past
eleven
one
winter's
night
he
said
and
i
was
driving
through
a
thick
forest
when
my
coachman
suddenly
leaned
back
in
his
seat
and
called
out
'do
you
hear
that'
i
listened
and
from
afar
came
a
plaintive
whining
sound
'it's
not
volki
is
it'
i
asked
'i'm
afraid
so
master'
the
coachman
replied
'they're
coming
on
after
us'
'but
they
are
some
way
off
still'
i
said
'that
is
so'
he
responded
'but
wolves
run
quick
and
our
horses
are
tired
if
we
can
reach
the
lake
first
we
shall
be
all
right
but
should
they
overtake
us
before
we
get
there--'
and
he
shrugged
his
great
shoulders
suggestively
'not
another
word'
i
cried
'drive--drive
as
if
'twere
the
devil
himself
i
have
my
rifle
ready
and
will
shoot
the
first
wolf
that
shows
itself'
'very
good
master'
he
answered
'i
will
do
everything
that
can
be
done
to
save
your
skin
and
mine'
he
cracked
his
whip
and
away
flew
the
horses
at
a
breakneck
speed
but
fast
as
they
went
they
could
not
outstrip
the
sound
of
the
howling
which
gradually
drew
nearer
and
nearer
until
around
the
curve
we
had
just
passed
shot
into
view
a
huge
gaunt
wolf
i
raised
my
rifle
and
fired
the
beast
fell
but
another
instantly
took
its
place
and
then
another
and
another
till
the
whole
pack
came
into
sight
and
close
behind
us
was
an
ocean
of
white
tossing
foam-flecked
jaws
and
red
gleaming
eyes
i
emptied
my
rifle
into
them
as
fast
as
i
could
pull
the
trigger
but
it
only
checked
them
momentarily
a
few
snaps
and
of
their
wounded
brethren
there
was
nothing
left
but
a
pile
of
glistening
bones
then
hie
away
and
they
were
once
again
in
red-hot
pursuit
at
last
our
pace
slackened
and
still
i
could
see
no
signs
of
the
lake
a
great
grey
shape
followed
by
others
then
rushed
by
us
and
tried
to
reach
the
horses'
flanks
with
their
sharp
gleaming
teeth
a
few
more
seconds
and
i
knew
we
should
be
both
fighting
back
to
back
the
last
great
fight
for
existence
indeed
i
had
ceased
firing
and
was
already
beginning
to
strike
out
furiously
with
the
butt
end
of
my
rifle
when
a
new
sound
arrested
my
attention
the
baying
of
dogs
'dogs'
i
screamed
'dogs
ivan'
that
was
the
coachman's
name
'dogs'
and
in
my
mad
joy
i
brained
two
wolves
in
as
many
blows
the
next
moment
a
large
pack
of
enormous
white
hounds
came
racing
down
on
us
the
wolves
did
not
wait
to
dispute
the
field
they
all
turned
tail
and
with
loud
howls
of
terror
rushed
off
in
the
direction
they
had
come
on
came
the
hounds--more
beautiful
dogs
i
had
never
seen
as
they
swept
by
more
than
one
brushed
against
my
knees
though
i
could
feel
nothing
save
intense
cold
when
they
were
about
twenty
yards
ahead
of
us
they
slowed
down
and
maintained
that
distance
in
front
of
us
till
we
arrived
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
there
they
halted
and
throwing
back
their
heads
bayed
as
if
in
farewell
and
suddenly
vanished
we
knew
then
that
they
were
no
earthly
hounds
but
spirit
ones
sent
by
a
merciful
providence
to
save
us
from
a
cruel
death
horses
and
the
unknown
as
in
my
chapters
on
cats
and
dogs
i
will
preface
this
chapter
on
horses
with
instances
of
alleged
haunted
localities
i
take
my
first
case
from
mr
wt
stead's
real
ghost
stories
published
in
1891
it
is
called
a
weird
story
from
the
indian
hills
and
mr
stead
preludes
it
thus
the
tale
is
told
by
general
barter
cb
of
careystown
whitegate
co
cork
at
the
time
he
witnessed
the
spectral
cavalcade
he
was
living
on
the
hills
in
india
and
when
one
evening
he
was
returning
home
he
caught
sight
of
a
rider
and
attendants
coming
towards
him
the
rest
of
the
story
given
in
the
general's
own
words
is
as
follows--
at
this
time
the
two
dogs
came
and
crouching
at
my
side
gave
low
frightened
whimpers
the
moon
was
at
the
full--a
tropical
moon--so
bright
that
you
could
see
to
read
a
newspaper
by
its
light
and--i
saw
the
party
before
me
advance
as
plainly
as
it
were
noon
day
they
were
above
me
some
eight
or
ten
feet
on
the
bridle-road
the
earth
thrown
down
from
which
sloped
to
within
a
pace
or
two
of
my
feet
on
the
party
came
until
almost
in
front
of
me
and
now
i
had
better
describe
them
the
rider
was
in
full
dinner
dress
with
white
waistcoat
and
wearing
a
tall
chimney-pot
hat
and
he
sat
a
powerful
hill
pony
dark
brown
with
mane
and
tail
in
a
listless
sort
of
way
the
reins
hanging
loosely
from
both
hands
a
syce
led
the
pony
on
each
side
but
their
faces
i
could
not
see
the
one
next
to
me
having
his
back
to
me
and
the
one
farthest
off
being
hidden
by
the
pony's
head
each
held
the
bridle
close
by
the
bit
the
man
next
me
with
his
right
and
the
other
with
his
left
hand
and
the
hands
were
on
the
thighs
of
the
rider
as
if
to
steady
him
in
his
seat
as
they
approached
i
knowing
they
could
not
get
to
any
place
other
than
my
own
called
out
in
hindustani
'quon
hai'
who
is
it
there
was
no
answer
and
on
they
came
until
right
in
front
of
me
when
i
said
in
english
'hullo
what
the
d----l
do
you
want
here'
instantly
the
group
came
to
a
halt
the
rider
gathering
the
bridle
reins
up
in
both
hands
turned
his
face
which
had
hitherto
been
looking
away
from
me
towards
me
and
looked
down
upon
me
the
group
was
still
as
in
a
tableau
with
the
bright
moon
shining
upon
it
and
i
at
once
recognized
the
rider
as
lieutenant
b
whom
i
had
formerly
known
the
face
however
was
different
from
what
it
used
to
be
in
the
place
of
being
clean-shaven
as
when
i
used
to
know
it
it
was
now
surrounded
by
a
fringe
what
used
to
be
known
as
a
newgate
fringe
and
it
was
the
face
of
a
dead
man
the
ghastly
waxen
pallor
of
it
brought
out
more
distinctly
in
the
moonlight
by
the
dark
fringe
of
hair
by
which
it
was
encircled
the
body
too
was
much
stouter
than
when
i
had
known
it
in
life
i
marked
this
in
a
moment
and
then
resolved
to
lay
hold
of
the
thing
whatever
it
might
be
i
dashed
up
the
bank
and
the
earth
which
had
been
thrown
on
the
side
giving
under
my
feet
i
fell
forward
up
the
bank
on
my
hands
recovering
myself
instantly
i
gained
the
road
and
stood
in
the
exact
spot
where
the
group
had
been
but
which
was
now
vacant
there
was
not
the
trace
of
anything
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
go
on
the
road
stopped
at
a
precipice
about
twenty
yards
further
on
and
it
was
impossible
to
turn
and
go
back
in
a
second
all
this
flashed
through
my
mind
and
i
then
ran
along
the
road
for
about
100
yards
along
which
they
had
come
until
i
had
to
stop
for
want
of
breath
but
there
was
no
trace
of
anything
and
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
i
then
returned
home
where
i
found
my
dogs
who
on
all
other
occasions
my
most
faithful
companions
had
not
come
with
me
along
the
road
next
morning
i
went
up
to
d
who
belonged
to
the
same
regiment
as
b
and
gradually
induced
him
to
talk
of
him
i
said
'how
very
stout
he
had
become
lately
and
what
possessed
him
to
allow
his
beard
to
grow
with
that
horrid
fringe'
d
replied
'yes
he
became
very
bloated
before
his
death
you
know
he
led
a
very
fast
life
and
while
on
the
sick
list
he
allowed
the
fringe
to
grow
in
spite
of
all
that
we
could
say
to
him
and
i
believe
he
was
buried
with
it'
i
asked
him
where
he
got
the
pony
i
had
seen
describing
it
minutely
'why'
said
d
'how
do
you
know
anything
about
all
this
you
hadn't
seen
b
for
two
or
three
years
and
the
pony
you
never
saw
he
bought
him
at
peshawur
and
killed
him
one
day
riding
in
his
reckless
fashion
down
the
hill
to
trete'
i
then
told
him
what
i
had
seen
the
night
before
once
when
the
galloping
sound
was
very
distinct
i
rushed
to
the
door
of
my
house
there
i
found
my
hindoo
bearer
standing
with
a
tattie
in
his
hand
i
asked
him
what
he
was
there
for
he
said
that
there
came
a
sound
of
riding
down
the
hill
and
'passed
him
like
a
typhoon'
and
went
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
he
was
determined
to
waylay
it
whatever
it
was
in
commenting
on
the
case
mr
stead
remarks
that
such
a
story
as
this
gravely
told
by
a
british
general
in
the
present
day
helps
us
to
understand
how
our
ancestors
came
to
believe
in
the
wonderful
story
of
herne
the
hunter
i
do
not
know
about
herne
the
hunter
but
it
is
at
all
events
good
testimony
that
horses
as
well
as
men
have
spirits
for
one
of
the
ghosts
the
general
saw
was
undoubtedly
that
of
the
pony
murdered
by
b
why
it
was
still
ridden
by
the
phantom
of
its
former
master
is
another
question
the
next
case
i
narrate
is
also
taken
from
mr
stead's
same
work
it
was
sent
him
by
one
of
the
leading
townsmen
of
cowes
in
the
isle
of
wight
and
runs
thus--
on
a
fine
evening
in
april
1859
the
writer
was
riding
with
a
friend
on
a
country
road
twilight
was
closing
down
on
us
when
after
a
silence
of
some
minutes
my
friend
suddenly
exclaimed
'no
man
knows
me
better
than
you
do
j
do
you
think
i
am
a
nervous
easily
frightened
sort
of
man'
'far
from
it'
said
i
'among
all
the
men
i
know
in
the
wild
country
i
have
lived
and
worked
in
i
know
none
more
fearless
or
of
more
unhesitating
nerve'
'well'
said
he
'i
think
i
am
that
too
and
though
i
have
travelled
these
roads
all
sorts
of
hours
summer
and
winter
for
twenty
years
i
never
met
anything
to
startle
me
or
that
i
could
not
account
for
until
last
monday
evening
about
this
time
it
was
riding
old
fan'
a
chestnut
mare
'here
on
this
cross-'
a
four-way
cross
'road
on
my
near
side
was
a
man
on
a
grey
horse
coming
from
this
left-hand
road
i
had
to
pull
my
off-rein
to
give
myself
room
to
pass
ahead
of
him
he
was
coming
at
a
right
angle
to
me
as
i
passed
the
head
of
the
horse
i
called
out
good
night
hearing
no
reply
i
turned
in
my
saddle
to
the
off-side
to
see
whether
he
appeared
to
be
asleep
as
he
rode
but
to
my
surprise
i
saw
neither
man
nor
horse
so
sure
was
i
that
i
had
seen
such
that
i
wheeled
old
fan
round
and
rode
back
to
the
middle
of
the
cross
and
on
neither
of
the
four
roads
could
i
see
a
man
or
horse
though
there
was
light
enough
to
see
two
hundred
or
three
hundred
yards
as
we
can
now
well
i
then
rode
over
that
gate'
a
gate
at
one
corner
opening
into
a
grass
field
'thinking
he
might
have
gone
that
way
looking
down
by
each
hedge
i
could
see
nothing
of
my
man
and
horse
and
then--and
not
until
then--i
felt
myself
thrill
and
start
with
a
shuddering
sense
that
i
had
seen
something
uncanny
and
jove
i
put
the
mare
down
this
hill
we
are
on
now
at
her
very
best
pace
but
the
strangest
part
of
my
story
is
to
come'
said
he
continuing
'after
i
had
done
my
business
at
the
farmhouse
here
at
foot
of
this
hill
i
told
the
old
farmer
and
his
wife
what
i
had
seen
as
i
have
now
told
you
the
old
man
said
'for
many
years
i
have
known
thee
m----
on
this
road
and
have
you
never
seen
the
like
before
on
that
cross
'seen
what
before
i
said
'why
a
man
in
light-coloured
clothes
on
a
grey
horse
said
he
'no
never
said
i
but
i
swear
i
have
this
evening
'the
farmer
asked
had
i
never
heard
of
what
happened
to
the
miller
of
l----
mills
about
forty
years
ago
'no
never
a
word
i
told
him
'well
he
said
about
forty
years
ago
this
miller
returning
from
market
was
waylaid
and
murdered
on
that
cross-road
pockets
rifled
of
money
and
watch
the
horse
ran
home
about
a
mile
away
two
serving-men
set
out
with
lanterns
and
found
their
master
dead
he
was
dressed
as
millers
often
do
in
this
part
of
the
country
in
light-coloured
clothes
and
the
horse
was
a
grey
horse
the
murderers
were
never
found
these
are
facts
continued
the
farmer
i
took
this
farm
soon
after
it
all
happened
and
though
i
have
known
all
this
and
have
passed
over
that
cross
several
thousands
of
times
i
never
knew
anything
unusual
there
myself
but
there
have
been
a
number
of
people
who
tell
the
same
story
you
have
told
mother
and
me
m----
and
describe
the
appearance
as
you
have
done
to
us
to-night'
mr
stead
goes
on
to
add
four
evenings
after
all
this
occurred
my
friend
related
it
to
me
as
we
were
riding
along
the
same
road
he
continued
to
pass
there
many
times
every
year
for
ten
years
but
never
a
day
saw
anything
of
that
sort
my
next
case
a
reproduction
of
a
letter
in
the
occult
review
of
september
1906
reads
thus--
a
phantom
horse
and
rider--mrs
gaskin
anderston's
story
the
following
story
is
i
think
very
remarkable
and
i
give
it
exactly
as
it
was
told
to
me
and
written
down
at
the
time
a
number
of
members
of
a
gentleman's
club
were
talking
and
discussing
amongst
other
subjects
the
possibility
of
there
being
a
future
state
for
animals
one
of
the
members
said
'i
firmly
believe
there
is
in
my
early
youth
i
had
a
practice
as
a
medical
man
in
one
of
the
midland
counties
one
of
my
patients
was
a
very
wealthy
man
who
owned
large
tracts
of
land
and
had
a
stud
composed
entirely
of
bay
horses
with
black
points--this
was
a
hobby
of
his
and
he
would
never
have
any
others
one
day
a
messenger
came
summoning
me
to
mr
l----
as
he
had
just
met
with
a
very
bad
accident
and
was
on
the
point
of
death
i
mounted
my
horse
and
started
off
without
delay
as
i
was
riding
through
the
front
gates
to
the
house
i
heard
a
shot
and
to
my
amazement
the
very
man
i
was
going
to
visit
rode
past
at
a
furious
pace
riding
a
wretched-looking
chestnut
with
one
white
forefoot
and
a
white
star
on
its
forehead
arrived
at
the
house
the
butler
said
'he
has
gone
sir
they
had
to
shoot
the
horse--you
would
hear
the
shot--and
at
the
same
moment
my
master
died
'he
had
had
this
horse
sent
on
approval
whilst
riding
it
it
backed
over
a
precipice
injuring
mr
l----
fatally
and
on
being
taken
to
the
stables
it
was
found
necessary
to
shoot
it'--alpha
the
next
case
i
append
i
published
it
in
a
weekly
journal
some
years
ago
was
related
to
me
by
a
captain
beauclerk
the
white
horse
of
eastover
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
one
morning
i
found
amongst
several
letters
awaiting
me
one
from
colonel
onslow
the
commanding
officer
of
my
regiment
when
i
first
joined
he
had
always
been
rather
partial
to
me
and
the
friendship
between
us
continued
after
his
retirement
i
heard
from
him
regularly
at
more
or
less
prolonged
intervals
and
either
at
christmas
or
easter
invariably
received
an
invitation
to
spend
a
few
days
with
him
on
this
occasion
he
was
most
anxious
that
i
should
accept
do
come
to
us
for
easter
he
wrote
i
am
sure
this
place
will
interest
you--it
is
haunted
the
cunning
fellow
he
knew
i
was
very
keen
on
psychical
research
work
and
would
go
almost
anywhere
on
the
bare
chance
of
seeing
a
ghost
at
that
time
i
was
quite
open-minded
i
had
arrived
at
no
definite
conclusion
as
to
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
ghosts
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
doubted
very
much
if
the
colonel's
word
in
these
circumstances
could
be
relied
upon
i
had
grave
suspicions
that
this
haunting
was
but
an
invention
for
the
purpose
of
getting
me
to
eastover
however
as
it
was
just
possible
that
i
might
be
mistaken--that
there
really
was
a
ghost
and
as
i
had
not
seen
colonel
onslow
for
a
long
time
and
indulged
in
feelings
of
the
warmest
regard
both
for
him
and
his
wife
i
resolved
to
go
accordingly
i
set
out
early
in
the
afternoon
of
the
good
friday
the
weather
which
had
been
muggy
in
london
grew
colder
and
colder
the
further
we
advanced
along
the
line
and
by
the
time
we
reached
eastover
there
was
every
prospect
of
a
storm
as
i
expected
a
closed
carriage
had
been
sent
to
meet
me
for
the
colonel
carrying
conservatism--with
more
conservatism
than
sense
perhaps--to
a
fine
point
cherished
a
deep-rooted
aversion
to
innovations
of
any
sort
and
consequently
abhorred
motors
his
house
eastover
hall
is
three
miles
from
the
station
and
lies
at
the
foot
of
a
steep
spine
of
the
chilterns
the
grounds
of
eastover
hall
were
extensive
but
in
the
ordinary
sense
far
from
beautiful
to
me
however
they
were
more
than
beautiful
there
was
a
grandeur
in
them--a
grandeur
that
appealed
to
me
far
more
than
mere
beauty--the
grandeur
of
desolation
the
grandeur
of
the
unknown
as
we
passed
through
the
massive
iron
gates
of
the
lodge
i
looked
upon
countless
acres
of
withered
undulating
grass
upon
a
few
rank
sedges
upon
a
score
or
so
of
decayed
trees
upon
a
house--huge
bare
grey
and
massive
upon
bleak
walls
upon
vacant
eye-like
windows
upon
crude
scenic
inhospitality
the
very
magnitude
of
which
overpowered
me
i
have
said
it
was
cold
but
there
hung
over
the
estate
of
eastover
an
iciness
that
brought
with
it
a
quickening
a
sickening
of
the
heart
and
a
dreariness
that
whilst
being
depressing
in
the
extreme
was
withal
sublime
sublime
and
mysterious
mysterious
and
insoluble
a
thousand
fancies
swarmed
through
my
mind
yet
i
could
grapple
with
none
and
i
was
loth
to
acknowledge
that
although
there
are
combinations
of
very
simple
material
objects
which
might
have
had
the
power
of
affecting
me
thus
yet
any
attempt
to
analyse
that
power
was
beyond--far
beyond--my
mental
capability
the
house
though
old--and
its
black
oak
panellings
silent
staircases
dark
corridors
and
general
air
of
gloom
were
certainly
suggestive
of
ghosts--did
not
affect
me
in
the
same
degree
the
fear
it
inspired
was
the
ordinary
fear
inspired
by
the
ordinary
superphysical
but
the
fear
i
felt
in
the
grounds
was
a
fear
created
by
something
out
of
the
way--something
far
more
bizarre
than
a
mere
phantom
of
the
dead
the
colonel
asked
me
if
i
had
experienced
any
unusual
sensations
the
moment
i
entered
the
house
and
i
told
him
yes
nearly
everyone
does
he
replied
and
yet
so
far
as
i
know
no
one
has
ever
seen
anything
the
noises
we
hear
all
round
the
house
have
lately
been
more
frequent
i
won't
describe
them
i
want
to
learn
your
unbiassed
opinion
of
them
first
we
then
had
tea
and
whilst
the
rest--there
was
a
large
house-party--indulged
in
music
and
cards
the
colonel
and
i
had
a
delightful
chat
about
old
times
i
went
to
bed
in
the
firm
resolution
of
keeping
awake
till
at
least
two
but
i
was
very
tired
and
the
excessive
cold
had
made
me
extremely
sleepy
consequently
despite
my
heroic
efforts
i
gradually
dozed
off
and
knew
no
more
till
it
was
broad
daylight
and
the
butler
entered
my
room
with
a
cup
of
tea
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
i
found
everyone
in
the
best
of
spirits
the
onslows
are
great
hands
at
original
entertainments
and
the
announcement
that
there
would
be
a
masked
ball
that
evening
was
received
with
tremendous
enthusiasm
to-night
we
dance
to-morrow
we
feed
on
easter
eggs
and
fancy
cakes
one
of
the
guests
laughingly
whispered
what
a
nicely
ordered
programme
i
hear
too
we
are
to
have
a
real
old-fashioned
easter
day--heaving
and
lifting
and
stool-ball
egad
the
colonel
deserves
knighthood
soon
after
breakfast
there
was
a
general
stampede
to
seeton
and
dinstable
to
buy
gifts
for
in
that
respect
again
the
onslows
stuck
to
old
customs
and
there
was
a
general
interchange
of
presents
on
easter
morning
my
purchases
made
i
joined
one
or
two
of
the
house-party
at
lunch
in
seeton
cycled
back
alone
to
eastover
in
time
for
tea
and
at
five
o'clock
commenced
my
first
explorations
of
the
grounds
the
sky
having
become
clouded
my
progress
was
somewhat
slow
i
did
the
park
first
and
i
had
not
gone
very
far
before
i
detected
the
same
presence
i
had
so
acutely
felt
the
previous
afternoon
like
the
scent
of
a
wild
beast
it
had
a
certain
defined
track
which
i
followed
astutely
eventually
coming
to
a
full
stop
in
front
of
a
wall
of
rock
i
then
perceived
by
the
aid
of
a
few
fitful
rays
of
suppressed
light
which
at
intervals
struggled
successfully
through
a
black
bank
of
clouds
the
yawning
mouth
of
a
big
cavern
from
the
roof
of
which
hung
innumerable
stalactites
i
now
suddenly
realized
that
i
was
in
a
very
lonely
isolated
spot
and
became
immeasurably
perturbed
the
unknown
something
in
the
atmosphere
which
had
inspired
me
with
so
much
fear
was
here
conglomerated--it
was
no
longer
the
mere
essence--it
was
the
whole
thing
the
whole
thing
but
what
was
that
thing
a
hideous
fascination
made
me
keep
my
gaze
riveted
on
the
gaping
hole
opposite
me
at
first
i
could
make
out
nothing--nothing
but
jagged
walls
and
roof
and
empty
darkness
then
there
suddenly
appeared
in
the
very
innermost
recesses
of
the
cave
a
faint
glow
of
crimson
light
which
grew
and
grew
until
with
startling
abruptness
it
resolved
itself
into
two
huge
eyes
red
and
menacing
the
sight
was
so
unexpected
and
by
reason
of
its
intense
malignity
so
appalling
that
i
was
simply
dumbfounded
i
could
do
nothing
but
stare
at
the
thing--paralysed
and
speechless
i
made
a
desperate
effort
to
get
back
my
self-possession
i
strove
with
all
my
might
to
reason
with
myself
to
assure
myself
that
this
was
the
supreme
moment
of
my
life
the
moment
i
had
so
long
and
earnestly
desired
but
it
was
in
vain
i
was
terrified--helplessly
hopelessly
terrified
the
eyes
moved
they
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
me
and
as
they
did
so
they
became
more
and
more
hostile
i
opened
my
mouth
to
shout
for
help
i
could
feel
my
lungs
bursting
under
the
tension
not
a
sound
came
and
then--then
as
the
eyes
closed
on
me
and
i
could
feel
the
cold
clammy
weight
pressing
me
down
there
rang
out
loud
and
clear
in
the
keen
and
cutting
air
of
the
spring
evening
a
whole
choir
of
voices--the
village
choral
society
i
am
not
particularly
fond
of
music--certainly
not
of
village
music
however
well
trained
it
may
be
but
i
can
honestly
affirm
that
at
that
moment
no
sounds
could
have
been
more
welcome
to
me
than
those
old
folk-songs
piped
by
the
rustics
for
the
instant
they
commenced
the
spell
that
so
closely
held
me
prisoner
was
broken
my
faculties
returned
and
reeling
back
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
hateful
thing
i
joyfully
turned
and
fled
i
related
my
adventure
to
the
colonel
and
he
told
me
that
the
cave
was
generally
deemed
to
be
the
most
haunted
spot
in
the
grounds
that
no
one
cared
to
venture
there
alone
after
dark
i
have
myself
many
times
visited
the
cave
at
night--in
the
company
of
others
he
said
and
we
have
invariably
experienced
sensations
of
the
utmost
horror
and
repulsion
though
we
have
seen
nothing
it
must
be
a
devil
i
thought
so
too
and
exclaimed
with
some
vehemence
that
the
proper
course
for
him
to
pursue
was
to
have
the
cave
filled
in
or
blasted
that
night
i
awoke
at
about
one
o'clock
with
the
feeling
very
strong
on
me
that
something
was
prowling
about
under
my
window
for
some
time
i
fought
against
the
impulse
to
get
out
of
bed
and
look
but
at
last
i
yielded
it
was
bright
moonlight--every
obstacle
in
the
grounds
stood
out
with
wonderful
clearness--and
directly
beneath
the
window
peering
up
at
me
were
the
eyes--red
lurid
satanical
a
dog
barked
and
they
vanished
i
did
not
sleep
again
that
night
not
until
the
daylight
broke
when
i
had
barely
shut
my
eyes
before
i
was
aroused
by
decidedly
material
bangings
on
the
doors
and
hyper-boisterous
easter
greetings
after
breakfast
a
few
of
the
party
went
to
church
a
few
into
the
nursery
to
romp
with
the
children
whilst
the
rest
dispersed
in
different
directions
at
luncheon
all
met
again
and
there
was
much
merry-making
over
the
tansy
cakes--very
foolish
no
doubt
but
to
me
at
least
very
delightful
and
perhaps
a
wise
practice
at
times
even
for
the
most
prosaic
in
the
afternoon
the
colonel
took
me
for
a
drive
to
a
charmingly
picturesque
village
in
the
chilterns
whence
we
did
not
set
out
on
our
way
back
till
it
was
twilight
the
colonel
was
a
good
whip
and
the
horse
though
young
and
rather
high-spirited
was
he
said
very
dependable
on
the
whole
and
had
never
caused
him
any
trouble
we
spun
along
at
a
brisk
trot--the
last
village
separating
us
from
the
hall
was
past
and
we
were
on
a
high
eminence
almost
within
sight
of
home
when
a
startling
change
in
the
atmosphere
suddenly
became
apparent--it
turned
icy
cold
i
made
some
sort
of
comment
to
the
colonel
and
as
i
did
so
the
horse
shied
hulloa
i
exclaimed
does
she
often
do
this
no
not
often
only
when
we
are
on
this
road
about
this
time
was
the
grim
rejoinder
keep
your
eyes
open
and
sit
tight
we
were
now
amid
scenery
of
the
same
desolate
type
that
had
so
impressed
me
the
day
of
my
arrival
gaunt
barren
hills
wild
uncultivated
levels
sombre
valleys
inhabited
only
by
grotesque
enigmatical
shadows
that
came
from
heaven
knows
where
and
hemmed
us
in
on
all
sides
a
large
quarry
half
full
of
water
and
partly
overgrown
with
brambles
riveted
my
attention
and
as
i
gazed
fixedly
at
it
i
saw
or
fancied
i
saw
the
shape
of
something
large
and
white--vividly
white--rise
from
the
bottom
the
glimpse
i
caught
of
it
was
however
only
momentary
for
we
were
moving
along
at
a
great
pace
and
i
had
hardly
seen
the
last
of
it
before
the
quarry
was
left
behind
and
we
were
descending
a
long
and
gradual
declivity
there
was
but
little
wind
but
the
cold
was
benumbing
neither
of
us
spoke
and
the
silence
was
unbroken
save
by
the
monotonous
patter
patter
of
the
horse's
hoofs
on
the
hard
road
we
were
i
should
say
about
half-way
down
the
hill
when
away
in
our
rear
from
the
direction
of
the
quarry
came
a
loud
protracted
neigh
i
at
once
looked
round
and
saw
standing
on
the
crest
of
the
eminence
we
had
just
quitted
and
most
vividly
outlined
against
the
enveloping
darkness
a
gigantic
horse
white
and
luminous
at
that
moment
our
own
mare
took
fright
we
were
abruptly
swung
forward
and
had
i
not--mindful
of
the
colonel's
warning--been
sitting
tight
i
should
undoubtedly
have
been
thrown
out
we
dashed
downhill
at
a
terrific
rate
our
mare
mad
with
terror
and
on
peering
over
my
shoulder
i
saw
to
my
horror
the
white
steed
tearing
along
not
fifty
yards
behind
us
i
was
now
able
to
get
a
vivid
impression
of
the
monstrous
beast
although
the
night
was
dark
a
strong
lurid
glow
which
seemed
to
emanate
from
all
over
it
enabled
me
to
see
distinctly
its
broad
muscular
breast
its
panting
steaming
flanks
its
long
graceful
legs
with
their
hairy
fetlocks
and
shoeless
shining
hoofs
its
powerful
but
arched
back
its
lofty
colossal
head
with
waving
forelock
and
broad
massive
forehead
its
snorting
nostrils
its
distended
foaming
jaws
its
huge
glistening
teeth
and
its
lips
wreathed
in
a
savage
grin
on
and
on
it
raced
its
strides
prodigious
its
mighty
mane
rising
and
falling
and
blowing
all
around
it
in
unrestrained
confusion
a
slip--a
single
slip
and
we
should
be
entirely
at
its
mercy
our
own
horse
was
now
out
of
control
a
series
of
violent
plunges
which
nearly
succeeded
in
unseating
me
had
enabled
her
to
get
the
check
of
the
bit
between
her
teeth
so
as
to
render
it
utterly
useless
and
she
had
then
started
off
at
a
speed
i
can
only
liken
to
flying
fortunately
we
were
now
on
a
more
or
less
level
ground
and
the
road
every
inch
of
which
our
horse
knew
was
smooth
and
broad
i
glanced
at
the
colonel
convulsively
clutching
the
reins
he
was
clinging
to
his
seat
for
dear
life
his
hat
gone
i
wanted
to
speak
but
i
knew
it
was
useless--the
shrieking
of
the
air
as
it
roared
past
us
deadened
all
sounds
once
or
twice
i
glanced
over
the
side
of
the
trap
the
rapidity
with
which
we
were
moving
caused
a
hideous
delusion--the
ground
appeared
to
be
gliding
from
beneath
us
and
i
experienced
the
sensation
of
resting
on
nothing
despite
our
danger
however
from
natural
causes--a
danger
which
i
knew
could
not
have
been
more
acute--my
fears
were
wholly
of
the
superphysical
it
was
not
the
horror
of
being
dashed
to
pieces
i
dreaded--it
was
the
horror
of
the
phantom
horse--of
its
sinister
hostile
appearance--of
its
unknown
powers
what
would
it
do
if
it
overtook
us
with
each
successive
breath
i
drew
i
felt
sure
the
fateful
event--the
long-anticipated
crisis--had
come
at
last
my
expectations
were
realized
the
teeth
of
the
gigantic
steed
closed
down
on
me
its
nostrils
hissed
resistance
out
of
me--i
swerved
tottered
fell
and
as
i
sank
on
the
ground
my
senses
left
me
on
coming
to
i
found
myself
in
a
propped-up
position
on
the
floor
of
a
tiny
room
with
someone
pouring
brandy
down
my
throat
happily
beyond
a
severe
shock
i
had
sustained
no
injury--a
sufficiently
miraculous
circumstance
as
the
trap
had
come
to
grief
in
failing
to
clear
the
lodge
gates
the
horse
had
skinned
its
knees
and
the
colonel
had
fractured
his
shoulder
of
the
phantom
horse
not
a
glimpse
had
been
seen
even
the
colonel
strange
to
relate
though
he
had
managed
to
peep
round
had
not
seen
it
he
had
heard
and
felt
a
presence
that
was
all
and
after
listening
to
my
experience
he
owned
he
was
truly
thankful
he
was
only
clair-audient
a
gift
like
yours
he
said
with
more
candour
than
kindness
is
a
curse
not
a
blessing
and
now
i
have
your
corroboration
i
might
as
well
tell
you
that
we
have
long
suspected
the
ghost
to
be
a
horse
and
have
attributed
its
hauntings
to
the
fact
that
some
time
ago
when
exploring
in
the
cave
several
prehistoric
remains
of
horses
were
found
one
of
which
we
kept
whilst
we
presented
the
others
to
a
neighbouring
museum
i
dare
say
there
are
heaps
more
undoubtedly
there
are
i
said
but
take
my
advice
and
leave
them
alone--re-inter
the
remains
you
have
already
unearthed--and
thus
put
a
stop
to
the
hauntings
if
you
go
on
excavating
and
keep
the
bones
you
find
the
disturbances
will
in
all
probability
increase
and
the
hauntings
will
become
not
only
many
but
multiform
needless
to
say
the
colonel
carried
out
my
injunctions
to
the
letter
far
from
continuing
his
work
of
excavation
he
lost
no
time
in
restoring
the
bones
he
had
kept
to
their
original
resting-place
after
which
as
i
predicted
the
hauntings
ceased
this
case
to
me
is
very
satisfactory
as
it
testifies
to
what
was
unquestionably
an
actual
phantasm
of
the
dead--of
a
dead
horse--albeit
that
horse
was
prehistoric
and
such
horses
are
all
the
more
likely
to
be
earth-bound
on
account
of
their
wild
untamed
natures
here
is
another
account
of
a
phantom
horse
taken
from
mr
stead's
real
ghost
stories
it
is
written
by
an
afrikander
who
in
a
letter
to
mr
stead
says
i
am
not
a
believer
in
ghosts
nor
never
was
but
seeing
you
wanted
a
census
of
them
i
can't
help
giving
you
a
remarkable
experience
of
mine
it
was
some
three
summers
back
and
i
was
out
with
a
party
of
boer
hunters
we
had
crossed
the
northern
boundary
of
the
transvaal
and
were
camped
on
the
ridges
of
the
sembombo
i
had
been
out
from
sunrise
and
was
returning
about
dusk
with
the
skin
of
a
fine
black
ostrich
thrown
across
the
saddle
in
front
of
me
in
the
best
of
spirits
at
my
good
luck
making
straight
for
the
camp
i
had
hardly
entered
a
thick
bush
when
i
thought
that
i
heard
somebody
behind
me
looking
behind
i
saw
a
man
mounted
on
a
white
horse
you
can
imagine
my
surprise
for
my
horse
was
the
only
one
in
camp
and
we
were
the
only
party
in
the
country
without
considering
i
quickened
my
pace
into
a
canter
and
on
doing
so
my
follower
appeared
to
do
the
same
at
this
i
lost
all
confidence
and
made
a
run
for
it
with
my
follower
in
hot
pursuit
as
it
appeared
to
my
imagination
and
i
did
race
for
it
the
skin
went
flying
in
about
two
minutes
and
my
rifle
would
have
done
the
same
had
it
not
been
strapped
over
my
shoulders
this
i
kept
up
until
i
rode
into
camp
right
among
the
pals
cooking
the
evening
meal
the
boers
about
the
camp
were
quick
in
their
enquiries
as
to
my
distressed
condition
and
regaining
confidence
i
was
putting
them
off
as
best
i
could
when
the
old
boss
an
old
boer
of
some
sixty-eight
or
seventy
years
looking
up
from
the
fire
said
'the
white
horse
the
englishman
has
seen
the
white
horse'
this
i
denied
but
to
no
purpose
and
that
night
round
the
camp
fire
i
took
the
trouble
to
make
enquiries
as
to
the
antecedents
of
the
white
horse
and
the
old
boer
after
he
had
commanded
silence
began
he
said
'the
english
are
not
brave
but
foolish
we
beat
them
at
majuba
some
twenty-five
seasons
back
there
was
an
englishman
here
like
you
he
had
brought
a
horse
with
him
against
our
advice
to
be
killed
with
the
fly
the
same
as
yours
will
be
in
a
day
or
two
and
he
like
you
would
go
where
he
was
told
not
to
go
and
one
day
he
went
into
a
bush
that
very
bush
you
rode
through
to-night
and
he
shot
seven
elephants
and
the
next
day
he
went
in
to
fetch
the
ivory
and
about
night
his
horse
came
into
camp
riderless
and
was
dead
from
the
fly
before
the
sun
went
down
the
englishman
is
in
that
bush
now
anyway
he
never
came
back
and
now
anybody
who
ventures
into
that
bush
is
chased
by
the
white
horse
i
wouldn't
go
into
that
bush
for
all
the
ivory
in
the
land
the
english
are
not
brave
but
foolish
we
beat
them
at
majuba'
here
he
ran
into
a
torrent
of
abuse
of
all
englishmen
in
general
and
in
particular
and
i
took
the
opportunity
of
rolling
myself
up
in
my
blankets
for
the
night
sleeping
all
the
better
for
my
adventure
now
mr
stead
i
don't
believe
in
ghosts
but
i
was
firmly
convinced
during
that
run
of
mine
and
can
vouch
for
the
accuracy
of
it
not
having
heard
a
word
of
the
englishman
or
his
white
horse
before
my
headlong
return
to
the
camp
that
night
i
shortly
hope
to
be
near
that
bush
again
but
like
the
old
boer
i
can
say
i
wouldn't
go
into
that
bush
again
for
all
the
ivory
in
the
land
ps--a
few
days
after
we
dropped
across
a
troop
of
elephants
without
entering
the
fatal
bush
and
managed
to
bag
seven
photographs
of
which
i
took
and
shall
be
pleased
to
send
for
your
inspection
if
desired
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
the
phantom
the
afrikander
saw
was
the
actual
spirit
of
a
dead
horse
another
experience
of
haunting
by
the
same
animal
was
told
me
by
a
chelsea
artist
who
assured
me
it
was
absolutely
true
i
append
it
as
nearly
as
possible
in
his
own
words
heralds
of
death
it
is
many
years
ago
he
began
since
i
came
into
my
property
heatherleigh
hall
near
carlisle
cumberland
it
was
left
me
by
my
great-uncle
general
wimpole
whom
i
had
never
seen
but
who
had
made
me
his
heir
in
preference
to
his
other
nephews
owing
to
my
reputed
likeness
to
an
aunt
to
whom
he
was
greatly
attached
of
course
i
was
much
envied
and
i
dare
say
a
good
many
unkind
things
were
said
about
me
but
i
did
not
care--heatherleigh
hall
was
mine
and
i
had
as
much
right
to
it
as
anyone
else
i
came
there
all
alone--my
two
brothers
dick
and
hal
the
one
a
soldier
and
the
other
a
sailor
were
both
away
on
foreign
service
whilst
beryl
my
one
and
only
sister
was
staying
with
her
fiancã©'s
family
in
bath
never
shall
i
forget
my
first
impressions
depict
the
day--an
october
afternoon
the
air
mellow
the
leaves
yellow
and
the
sun
a
golden
red
not
a
trace
of
clouds
or
wind
anywhere
everything
serene
and
still
a
broad
highway
a
wood
a
lodge
in
the
midst
of
the
wood
large
iron
gates
a
broad
carriage
drive
planted
on
either
side
with
lofty
pines
and
elms
whose
gnarled
and
forked
branches
threw
grotesque
and
not
altogether
pleasing
shadows
on
the
pale
gravel
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
wide
expanses
of
soft
velvety
grass
interspersed
at
regular
intervals
with
plots
of
flowers--dahlias
michaelmas
daisies--no
longer
in
their
first
bloom--chrysanthemums
etc
beyond
the
lawn
the
house
and
beyond
that
again
and
on
either
side
big
old-fashioned
gardens
full
of
fruit--fruit
of
all
kinds
some
such
as
grapes
and
peaches
in
monster
green-houses
and
others--luscious
pears
blenheim
oranges
golden
pippins
etc--in
rich
profusion
in
the
open
the
whole
encompassed
by
a
high
and
solid
brick
wall
topped
with
a
bed
of
mortar
and
broken
glass
the
house
which
was
built
or
rather
faced
with
split
flints
and
edged
and
buttressed
with
cut
grey
stone
had
a
majestic
but
gloomy
appearance
its
front
lofty
and
handsome
was
somewhat
castellated
in
style
two
semicircular
bows
or
half-moons
placed
at
a
suitable
distance
from
each
other
rising
from
the
base
to
the
summit
of
the
edifice
these
were
pierced
at
every
floor
with
rows
of
stone-mullioned
windows
rising
to
the
height
of
four
or
five
stories
the
flat
wall
between
had
larger
windows
lighting
the
great
hall
gallery
and
upper
apartments
these
windows
were
abundantly
ornamented
with
stained
glass
representing
the
arms
honours
and
alms-deeds
of
the
wimpole
family
the
towers
half
included
in
the
building
were
completely
circular
within
and
contained
the
winding
stair
of
the
mansion
and
whoso
ascended
them
when
the
winter
wind
was
blowing
seemed
rising
by
a
tornado
to
the
clouds
midway
between
the
towers
was
a
heavy
stone
porch
with
a
gothic
gateway
surmounted
by
a
battlemented
parapet
made
gable
fashion
the
apex
of
which
was
garnished
by
a
pair
of
dolphins
rampant
and
antagonistic
whose
corkscrew
tails
seemed
contorted
by
the
last
agonies
of
rage
convulsed
the
porch
doors
thrown
open
to
receive
me
led
into
a
hall
wide
vaulted
and
lofty
and
decorated
here
and
there
with
remnants
of
tapestry
and
grim
portraits
of
the
wimpoles
one
picture
in
particular
riveted
my
attention
hung
in
an
obscure
corner
where
the
light
rarely
penetrated
it
represented
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
young
man
with
a
strikingly
beautiful
face--the
features
small
and
regular
like
those
of
a
woman--the
hair
yellow
and
curly
it
was
the
eyes
that
struck
me
most--they
followed
me
everywhere
i
went
with
a
persistency
that
was
positively
alarming
there
was
something
in
them
i
had
never
seen
in
canvas
eyes
before
something
deeper
and
infinitely
more
intricate
than
could
be
produced
by
mere
paint--something
human
and
yet
not
human
friendly
and
yet
not
friendly
something
baffling
enigmatical
haunting
i
enquired
of
my
deceased
relative's
aged
housekeeper
mrs
grimstone--whom
i
had
retained--whose
portrait
it
was
and
she
replied
with
a
scared
look
'horace
youngest
son
of
sir
algernon
wimpole
who
died
here
in
1745'
'the
face
fascinates
me'
i
said
'is
there
any
history
attached
to
it'
'why
yes
sir'
she
responded
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
'but
the
late
master
never
liked
referring
to
it'
'is
it
as
bad
as
that'
i
said
laughing
'tell
me'
'well
sir'
she
began
'they
do
say
as
how
sir
algernon
who
was
a
thorough
country
squire--very
fond
of
hunting
and
shooting
and
all
sorts
of
manly
exercises--never
liked
mr
horace
who
was
delicate
and
dandified--what
the
folk
in
those
days
used
to
style
a
macaroni
the
climax
came
when
mr
horace
took
up
with
the
jacobites
sir
algernon
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
then
and
turned
him
adrift
one
day
there
was
a
great
commotion
in
the
neighbourhood
the
government
troops
were
hunting
the
place
in
search
of
rebels
and
who
should
come
galloping
up
the
avenue
with
a
couple
of
troopers
in
hot
pursuit
but
mr
horace
the
noise
brought
out
sir
algernon
and
he
was
so
infuriated
to
think
that
his
son
was
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
a
disgraceful
young
cub
he
called
him
that
despite
mr
horace's
entreaties
for
protection
he
ran
him
through
with
his
sword
it
was
a
dreadful
thing
for
a
father
to
do
and
sir
algernon
bitterly
repented
it
his
wife
who
had
been
devoted
to
mr
horace
left
him
and
at
last
in
a
fit
of
despondency
he
hanged
himself--out
there
on
one
of
the
elms
lining
the
avenue
it
is
still
standing
ever
since
then
they
do
say
that
the
wood
is
haunted
and
that
before
the
death
of
any
member
of
the
family
mr
horace
is
seen
galloping
along
the
old
carriage
drive'
'pleasant'
i
grunted
'and
how
about
the
house--is
it
haunted
too'
'i
daresn't
say'
she
murmured
'some
will
tell
you
it
is
and
some
will
tell
you
it
isn't'
'in
which
category
are
you
included'
i
asked
'well'
she
said
'i
have
lived
here
happy
and
comfortable
forty-five
years
the
day
after
to-morrow
and
that
speaks
for
itself
don't
it'
and
with
that
she
hobbled
off
and
showed
me
the
way
to
the
dining-room
what
a
house
it
was
from
the
hall
proceeded
doorways
and
passages
more
than
the
ordinary
memory
could
retain
of
these
portals
one
at
each
end
conducted
to
the
tower
stairs
others
to
the
reception-rooms
and
domestic
offices
in
the
right
wing
besides
bedrooms
galore
was
a
lofty
and
spacious
picture
gallery
in
the
left--a
chapel
for
the
wimpoles
were
formerly
roman
catholics
the
general
fittings
and
furniture
both
of
the
hall
and
house
in
general
were
substantial
venerable
and
strongly
corroborative
of
what
mrs
grimstone
hinted
at--they
suggested
ghosts
the
walls
lined
with
black
oak
panels
or
dark
hangings
that
fluttered
mysteriously
each
time
the
wind
blew
were
funereal
indeed
and
so
high
and
narrow
were
the
windows
that
little
was
to
be
discerned
through
them
but
cross-barred
portions
of
the
sky
one
spot
in
particular
appealed
to
my
nerves--and
that
a
long
vaulted
stone
passage
leading
from
a
morning
room
to
the
foot
of
the
back
staircase
here
the
voice
and
even
the
footsteps
echoed
with
a
hollow
low
response
and
often
when
i
have
been
hurrying
along
it--i
never
dared
walk
slowly--i
have
fancied--and
maybe
it
was
more
than
fancy--i
have
been
pursued
time
passed
and
from
being
merely
used
to
my
new
environments
i
grew
to
take
a
pride
in
them
to
love
them
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
several
of
my
neighbours
those
i
deemed
the
most
desirable
and
on
returning
from
wintering
abroad
brought
home
a
bride
a
young
polish
girl
who
added
lustre
to
the
surroundings
and
in
no
small
degree
helped
to
dissipate
the
gloom
indeed
had
it
not
been
for
the
picture
in
the
hall
and
for
the
twilight
shadows
and
twilight
footsteps
in
the
stone
passage
i
should
soon
have
ceased
to
think
of
ghosts
ghosts
forsooth
when
all
around
me
vibrated
with
the
sounds
of
girlish
laughter
and
the
summer
sunshine
sparkling
on
the
golden
curls
of
my
child-wife
saw
itself
reflected
a
millionfold
in
the
alluring
depths
of
her
azure
eyes
in
halcyon
days
like
these
who
thinks
of
ghosts
and
death
and
yet
it
is
in
just
such
times
as
these
that
hell
is
nearest
there
came
a
night
in
august
when
the
air
was
so
hot
and
sultry
that
i
could
scarcely
breathe
and
unable
to
bear
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
and
gardens
any
longer
i
sought
the
coolness
of
the
wood
olga--my
wife--did
not
accompany
me
as
she
was
suffering
from
a
slight--thank
god
it
was
only
slight--sunstroke
it
was
close
on
midnight
and
there
was
a
dead
stillness
abroad
that
seemed
as
if
it
must
be
universal--as
if
it
enveloped
the
whole
of
nature
i
tried
to
realize
london--to
depict
the
strand
and
piccadilly
aglow
with
artificial
light
and
reverberating
with
the
roll
of
countless
traffic
and
the
tread
of
millions
of
feet
i
failed
the
incongruity
of
such
imaginings
here--here
amidst
omnipotent
silence--rendered
such
thoughts
impossible
a
leaf
rustled
and
its
rustling
sounded
to
my
ears
like
the
gentle
closing
of
some
giant
door
a
twig
fell
and
i
turned
sharply
round
convinced
i
should
see
a
pile
of
broken
debris
i
love
all
trees
but
i
love
them
best
by
day--to
me
it
seems
that
night
utterly
metamorphizes
them--brings
out
in
them
a
subtler
darker
side
one
would
little
suspect
here
in
this
oak
for
instance
was
an
example
in
the
morning
one
sees
in
it
nought
but
quiet
dignity
venerable
old
age
benevolence
and
by
reason
of
the
ample
protection
its
branches
afford
from
the
sun
charity
and
philanthropy
its
leaves
are
bright
dainty
pretty
its
trunk
suggests
nothing
but
a
cosy
and
soothing
retreat
for
students
and
lovers
but
now--see
how
different
these
great
spreading
gnarled
branches
are
hands
claws--monstrous
and
menacing
those
leaves
no
longer
bright
remind
me
of
a
hearse's
plumes
their
rustling--of
the
rustling
and
switching
of
a
pall
or
winding-sheet
the
trunk
black
sinuous
towering
is
assuredly
no
piece
of
timber
but
something
pulpy
something
intangible
something
antagonistic
mystic
devilish
i
turn
from
it
and
shudder
then
my
mind
reverts
to
the
elm--the
elm
on
which
sir
algernon
hanged
himself
i
remember
it
is
not
more
than
twenty
yards
from
where
i
stand
i
stare
down
at
the
soil
at
the
clumps
of
crested
dog's-tail
and
stray
blades
of
succulent
darnel
i
force
my
attention
on
a
toadstool
whose
soft
and
lowly
head
gleams
sickly
white
in
the
moonbeams
i
glance
from
it
to
a
sleeping
close-capped
dandelion
from
it
to
a
thistle
from
it
again
to
a
late
bush
vetch
and
then
willy-nilly
to
the
accursed
elm
my
god
what
a
change
it
wasn't
like
that
when
i
passed
it
at
noon
it
was
just
an
ordinary
tree
then
but
now
now--and
what
is
that--that
sinister
bundle--suspended
from
one
of
its
curling
branches
a
cold
sweat
bursts
out
on
me
my
knees
tremble
my
hair
begins
to
rise
on
end
swinging
round
i
am
about
to
rush
away--blindly
rush
away--hither
thither
anywhere--anywhere
out
of
sight
of
that
tree
and
of
all
the
hideous
possibilities
it
promises
to
materialize
for
me
i
have
not
taken
five
strides
however
before
i
am
pulled
sharply
up
by
the
sounds
of
horse's
hoofs--of
hoofs
on
the
hard
gravel
away
in
the
distance
they
speedily
grow
nearer
a
horse
is
galloping
galloping
towards
me
along
the
broad
carriage
drive
nearer
nearer
and
nearer
it
comes
who
is
it
what
is
it
a
deadly
nausea
seizes
me
i
swerve
totter
reel
and
am
only
prevented
from
falling
by
the
timely
interference
of
a
pine
the
concussion
with
its
leviathan
trunk
clears
my
senses
all
my
faculties
become
wonderfully
and
painfully
alert
i
would
give
my
very
soul
if
it
were
not
so--if
i
could
but
fall
asleep
or
faint
the
sound
of
the
hoofs
is
very
much
nearer
now
so
near
indeed
that
i
may
see
the
man--heaven
grant
it
may
be
only
a
man
after
all--any
moment
ah
my
heart
gives
a
great
sickly
jerk
something
has
shot
into
view
there
not
fifty
yards
from
me
where
the
road
curves
and
the
break
in
the
foliage
overhead
admits
a
great
flood
of
moonlight
i
recognize
the
thing
at
once
it's
not
a
man
it's
nothing
human
it's
the
picture
i
know
so
well
and
dread
so
much
the
portrait
of
horace
wimpole
that
hangs
in
the
main
hall--and
it's
mounted
on
a
coal-black
horse
with
wildly
flying
mane
and
foaming
mouth
on
and
on
they
come
thud
thud
thud
the
man
is
not
dressed
as
a
rider
but
is
wearing
the
costume
in
the
picture--ie
that
of
a
macaroni
a
nut
more
fit
for
a
lady's
seminary
than
a
fine
old
english
mansion
something
beside
me
rustles--rustles
angrily
and
i
know
i
can
feel
it
is
the
bundle
on
the
branch--the
ghastly
groaning
creaking
croaking
caricature
of
sir
algernon
the
horseman
comes
up
to
me--our
eyes
meet--i
am
looking
in
those
of
a
dead--of
a
long
since
dead
man--my
blood
freezes
he
flashes
past
me--thud
thud
thud
a
bend
in
the
road
and
he
vanishes
from
sight
but
i
can
still
hear
him
still
hear
the
mad
patter
of
his
horse's
hoofs
as
they
bear
him
onward
lifeless
fleshless
weightless
to
his
ancient
home
god
pity
the
souls
that
know
no
rest
how
i
got
back
to
the
house
i
hardly
know
i
believe
it
was
with
my
eyes
shut
and
i
am
certain
i
ran
all
the
way
about
four
o'clock
the
following
afternoon
i
received
a
cablegram
from
malta
intuition
warned
me
to
prepare
for
the
worst
its
contents
were
unpleasantly
short
and
pithy--'hal
drowned
at
two
o'clock
this
morning--dick'
two
years
passed--again
an
august
night
hot
and
oppressive
as
before
and
again--though
surely
against
my
will
my
better
judgment
if
you
like--i
visited
the
wood
horse's
hoofs
just
the
same
as
before
the
same
galloping
the
same
figure
the
same
eyes
the
same
mad
panic-stricken
flight
home
and
early
in
the
succeeding
afternoon
a
similar
cablegram--this
time
from
sicily
'dick
died
at
midnight
dysentery--andrews'
jack
andrews
was
dick's
pal--his
bosom
friend
so
once
again
the
phantom
rider
had
brought
its
grisly
message--played
its
ghoulish
rã´le
my
brothers
were
both
dead
now
and
only
beryl
remained
another
year
sped
by
and
the
last
night
in
october--a
monday--saw
me
impelled
by
a
fascination
i
could
not
resist
once
again
in
the
wood
up
to
a
point
everything
happened
as
before
as
the
monotonous
church
clock
struck
twelve
from
afar
came
the
sound
of
hoofs
nearer
nearer
nearer
and
then
with
startling
abruptness
the
rider
shot
into
view
and
now
mixed
with
the
awful
indescribable
terror
the
figure
always
conveyed
with
it
came
a
feeling
of
intense
rage
and
indignation
should
beryl--beryl
whom
i
loved
next
best
to
my
wife--be
torn
from
me
even
as
dick
and
hal
had
been
no
ten
thousand
times
no
sooner
than
that
i
would
risk
anything
a
sudden
inspiration
coming
maybe
from
the
whispering
leaves
or
from
the
elm
or
from
the
mysterious
flickering
moonbeams
flashed
through
me
could
i
not
intercept
the
figures
drive
them
back
by
doing
so
something
told
me
beryl
might
be
saved
a
terrible
struggle
at
once
took
place
within
me
and
it
was
only
after
the
most
desperate
efforts
that
i
at
length
succeeded
in
fighting
back
my
terror
and
flung
myself
out
into
the
middle
of
the
drive
no
words
of
mine
can
describe
all
i
went
through
as
i
stood
there
anticipating
the
arrival
of
the
phantoms
at
length
they
came
right
up
to
me
and
as
with
frantic
resolution
i
screwed
up
courage
to
plant
myself
directly
in
their
path
and
stared
up
into
the
rider's
eyes
the
huge
steed
halted
gave
one
shrill
neigh
and
turning
round
galloped
back
again
disappearing
whither
it
had
emerged
two
days
afterwards
i
received
a
letter
from
my
brother-in-law
'i
have
been
having
an
awful
time'
he
wrote
'my
darling
beryl
has
been
frightfully
ill
on
monday
night
we
gave
up
all
hope
of
her
recovery
but
at
twelve
o'clock
when
the
doctor
bid
us
prepare
for
the
end
the
most
extraordinary
thing
happened
turning
over
in
bed
she
distinctly
called
out
your
name
and
rallied
and
now
thank
god
she
is
completely
out
of
danger
the
doctor
says
it
is
the
most
astonishing
recovery
he
has
ever
known'





that
is
twenty
years
ago
and
i've
not
seen
the
phantom
rider
since
nor
do
i
fancy
he
will
appear
again
for
when
i
look
into
the
eyes
of
the
picture
in
the
hall
they
are
no
longer
wandering
but
at
rest





perhaps
one
of
the
most
interesting
accounts
of
the
phantasm
of
a
horse
in
my
possession
is
that
recorded
by
ce
g----
a
friend
of
my
boyhood
writing
to
me
from
the
united
states
some
months
ago
he
says
knowing
how
interested
you
are
in
all
cases
of
hauntings
and
in
those
relating
to
animal
ghosts
especially
i
am
sending
you
an
account
of
an
'experience'
that
happened
to
my
uncle
mr
john
dale
about
six
months
ago
he
was
returning
to
his
home
in
bishopstone
near
helena
montana
shortly
after
dark
and
had
arrived
at
a
particularly
lonely
part
of
the
road
where
the
trees
almost
meet
overhead
when
his
horse
showed
signs
of
restlessness
it
slackened
down
halted
shivered
whinnied
and
kept
up
such
a
series
of
antics
that
my
uncle
descended
from
the
trap
to
see
if
anything
was
wrong
with
it
he
thought
that
perhaps
it
was
going
to
have
some
kind
of
fit
or
an
attack
of
ague
which
is
not
an
uncommon
complaint
among
animals
in
his
part
of
the
country
and
he
was
preparing
to
give
it
a
dose
of
quinine
when
suddenly
it
reared
up
violently
and
before
he
could
stop
it
was
careering
along
the
road
at
lightning
speed
my
uncle
was
now
in
a
pretty
mess
he
was
stranded
in
a
forest
without
a
lantern
ten
miles
at
least
from
home
feeling
too
depressed
to
do
anything
he
sat
down
by
the
roadside
and
seriously
thought
of
remaining
there
till
daybreak
a
twinge
of
rheumatism
however
reminded
him
the
ground
was
little
warmer
than
ice
and
made
him
realize
that
lying
on
it
would
be
courting
death
consequently
he
got
up
and
setting
his
lips
grimly
struck
out
in
the
direction
of
bishopstone
at
every
step
he
took
the
track
grew
darker
shadows
of
trees
and
countless
other
things
for
which
he
could
see
no
counterpart
crept
out
and
rendered
it
almost
impossible
for
him
to
tell
where
to
tread
a
peculiar
indefinable
dread
also
began
to
make
itself
felt
and
the
darkness
seemed
to
him
to
assume
an
entirely
new
character
he
plodded
on
breaking
into
a
jog-trot
every
now
and
then
and
whistling
by
way
of
companionship
the
stillness
was
sepulchral--he
strained
his
ears
but
could
not
even
catch
the
sound
of
those
tiny
animals
that
are
usually
heard
in
the
thickets
and
furze-bushes
at
night
and
all
his
movements
were
exaggerated
until
their
echoes
seemed
to
reverberate
through
the
whole
forest
a
turn
of
the
road
brought
him
into
view
of
something
that
made
his
heart
throb
with
delight
standing
by
the
wayside
was
an
enormous
coach
with
four
huge
horses
pawing
the
ground
impatiently
my
uncle
rushed
up
to
the
driver
who
was
so
enveloped
in
wraps
he
could
not
see
his
face
and
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
begged
for
the
favour
of
a
lift--if
not
to
helena
itself
as
far
in
that
direction
as
the
coach
was
going
the
driver
made
no
reply
but
with
his
hand
motioned
my
uncle
to
get
in
the
latter
did
not
need
a
second
bidding
and
the
moment
he
was
seated
the
vehicle
started
off
it
was
a
large
roomy
conveyance
but
had
a
stifling
atmosphere
about
it
that
struck
my
uncle
as
most
unpleasant
and
although
he
could
see
no
one
he
intuitively
felt
he
was
not
alone
and
that
more
than
one
pair
of
eyes
were
watching
him
the
coach
did
not
go
as
fast
as
my
uncle
expected
but
moved
with
a
curious
gliding
motion
and
the
wheels
made
no
noise
whatever
this
added
to
my
uncle's
apprehensions
and
he
almost
made
up
his
mind
to
open
the
carriage
door
and
jump
out
something
however
which
he
could
not
account
for
restrained
him
and
he
maintained
his
seat
outside
all
was
still
profoundly
dark
the
trees
were
scarcely
distinguishable
as
deeper
masses
of
shadow
and
were
recognizable
only
by
the
resinous
odour
that
from
time
to
time
sluggishly
flowed
in
at
the
open
window
as
the
coach
rolled
on
at
length
they
overtook
some
other
vehicle
and
for
the
first
time
for
some
hours
my
uncle
heard
the
sound
of
solid
wheels
which
were
as
welcome
to
him
as
any
joy
bells
just
as
they
were
passing
the
conveyance--a
small
wagonette
drawn
by
a
pair
of
horses
the
latter
took
fright
there
were
loud
shouts
and
a
great
stampede
and
my
uncle
who
leaned
out
of
the
coach
window
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
vehicle
dashing
along
ahead
of
them
at
a
frightful
speed
the
driver
of
the
coach
apparently
totally
unconcerned
continued
his
journey
at
the
same
regular
mechanical
pace
presently
my
uncle
heard
the
sound
of
rushing
water
and
knew
they
must
be
nearing
the
usk
a
tributary
of
the
battle
which
was
only
five
miles
from
his
house
the
forest
now
ceased
and
they
crossed
the
road
over
the
bridge
in
a
brilliant
burst
of
moonlight
about
a
mile
or
so
further
on
the
coach
halted
and
to
my
uncle's
surprise
he
found
himself
in
front
of
a
house
he
had
no
recollection
of
seeing
before
he
got
out
and
to
his
horror
saw
that
instead
of
riding
in
a
coach
he
had
been
riding
in
a
hearse
and
that
the
horses
had
on
their
heads
gigantic
sable
plumes
while
he
was
standing
gazing
at
the
extraordinary
equipage
the
door
of
the
house
slowly
opened
and
two
figures
came
out
carrying
a
small
coffin
which
they
placed
inside
the
vehicle
he
then
heard
loud
peals
of
mad
hilarious
laughter
and
coach
and
horses
immediately
vanished
my
uncle
arrived
home
safely
but
the
shock
of
what
he
had
experienced
kept
him
in
bed
for
some
days
he
learned
that
a
phantom
coach
similar
to
the
one
he
had
ridden
in
had
been
seen
in
the
forest
twenty
years
previously
and
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
prognostication
of
some
great
misfortune
which
supposition
in
my
uncle's
case
at
least
proved
true
as
his
wife
died
of
apoplexy
a
few
days
after
this
adventure
yet
another
case
of
haunting
by
the
phantasms
of
a
horse
comes
to
me
from
a
gentleman
in
marseilles
who
told
it
me
thus--
it
was
9
pm
when
i
left
my
friend
maitland's
hotel
in
chã¢teauborne
and
facing
north
set
out
on
my
way
to
liffre
where
my
headquarters
had
been
for
the
past
fortnight
liffre
is
in
the
hills
and
the
road
which
separated
it
from
chã¢teauborne
wild
and
lonely
enough
in
daylight
and
when
the
weather
is
fair
is
almost
untraversable
in
winter
the
night
in
question
was
christmas
eve
the
snow
had
fallen
heavily
during
the
day
and
with
the
wind
blowing
in
icy
draughts
from
the
north-east
there
was
every
prospect
of
another
downfall
maitland
pressed
me
to
stay
in
his
hotel
'it
is
sheer
folly'
he
said
'for
you
to
attempt
to
get
home
in
weather
like
this
it
is
pitch
dark
you
are
not
familiar
with
the
route
and
if
you
don't
wander
off
the
track
and
tumble
over
a
precipice
you
will
walk
into
a
snowdrift
be
sensible--sleep
here'
much
however
as
i
should
have
liked
to
follow
his
counsel
i
did
not
feel
justified
in
doing
so
as
i
had
a
lot
of
correspondence
to
attend
to
and
i
realized
it
was
most
necessary
for
me
to
get
back
to
liffre
without
any
further
delay
it
was
true
the
night
was
inky
black
but
with
the
aid
of
a
lamp
i
hadn't
the
slightest
doubt
i
could
find
my
way
maitland
bartered
for
a
candle
lantern
with
his
host
and
armed
with
this
a
flagon
of
brandy
and
water
and
a
thick
stick
i
said
good-bye
to
chã¢teauborne
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
saw
me
beyond
the
outskirts
of
the
town
wherein
i
was
the
sole
pedestrian
and
silence
reigned
supreme
on
and
on
i
plodded
the
feeble
yellow
light
of
my
lantern
just
preventing
me--but
only
just--from
wandering
from
the
track
the
road
which
for
the
first
mile
or
so
was
tolerably
level
gradually
began
to
rise
and
as
it
did
so
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
indistinct
images
of
gigantic
naked
trees
that
becoming
more
and
more
numerous
and
closer
and
closer
together
at
length
united
their
long
and
grotesquely
shaped
branches
overhead
and
i
found
myself
in
the
depths
of
a
vast
forest
the
snow
which
had
up
to
the
present
held
off
now
recommenced
to
fall
and
presently
the
wind
which
had
for
some
time
been
slowly
acquiring
strength
came
howling
through
the
trees
with
the
utmost
fury
the
first
blast
swishing
the
lantern
out
of
my
hands
and
hurling
me
with
considerable
force
into
an
undergrowth
of
thorns
and
brambles
out
of
which
i
extricated
myself
with
no
little
difficulty
i
was
now
in
the
sorriest
of
plights--enveloped
on
all
sides
in
stygian
darkness
i
was
unable
to
discover
my
lantern
and
was
thus
totally
at
the
mercy
of
the
ruthless
elements
there
were
only
two
courses
before
me--either
i
must
remain
where
i
was
and
be
frozen
to
death
or
making
a
guess
at
the
route
i
must
push
on
ahead
and
run
the
risk
of
ending
my
life
at
the
bottom
of
a
ravine
i
chose
the
latter
groping
about
with
my
feet
until
i
at
length
discovered
what
i
thought
must
be
the
right
track
i
pushed
ahead
and
staggering
and
stumbling
forward
managed
to
make
some
sort
of
progress
terribly
slow
though
it
was
the
blinding
darkness
of
the
snowy
night
the
intense
silence
and
utter
solitude
of
the
place
combined
with
the
knowledge
that
on
all
sides
of
me
lay
holes
and
chasms
dampened
my
spirits
and
raised
strange
phantoms
in
my
imagination
the
wind
now
rose
and
the
dismal
sighing
of
the
trees
speedily
grew
into
a
series
of
the
most
perturbing
screeches
as
the
branches
and
trunks
swayed
to
and
fro
like
reeds
before
the
violence
of
the
hurricane
at
this
juncture
i
gave
myself
up
for
lost
and
coming
to
a
standstill
up
to
my
knees
in
snow
was
preparing
to
lie
down
and
die
when
to
my
great
joy
a
light
suddenly
appeared
ahead
of
me
and
the
next
moment
a
man
mounted
on
a
big
white
horse
rode
noiselessly
up
to
me
he
was
wrapped
in
a
shaggy
great-coat
and
a
slouch
hat
worn
low
over
his
eyes
completely
hid
his
face
from
me
in
his
disengaged
hand
he
carried
a
lantern
'by
jove'
i
exclaimed
'i
am
glad
to
see
you
for
i've
lost
the
track
to
liffre
can
you
tell
me
or
better
still
show
me
the
way
to
some
house
where
i
can
put
up
for
the
remainder
of
the
night'
the
stranger
made
no
reply
but
bidding
me
follow
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
rode
silently
in
front
of
me
and
although
i
tried
to
keep
up
with
him
i
could
not
and
the
odd
thing
was
that
without
apparently
increasing
his
pace
he
always
maintained
his
distance
after
proceeding
in
this
manner
for
possibly
ten
minutes
we
suddenly
turned
to
the
left
and
i
found
myself
in
a
big
clearing
in
the
wood
with
a
long
low-built
house
opposite
me
my
guide
then
paused
and
indicating
the
front
door
of
the
house
with
an
emphatic
gesture
of
his
hand
seemed
suddenly
to
melt
away
into
thin
air
for
although
i
peered
about
me
on
all
sides
to
try
to
find
some
indications
of
him
neither
he
nor
his
horse
was
anywhere
to
be
seen
thinking
this
was
rather
queer
but
quite
ready
to
attribute
it
to
natural
causes
i
approached
the
building
and
making
use
of
my
knuckles
in
lieu
of
a
knocker
beat
a
loud
tattoo
on
the
woodwork
there
was
no
response
again
i
rapped
and
the
door
slowly
opening
revealed
a
pair
of
gleaming
dark
eyes
'what
do
you
want'
enquired
a
harsh
voice
in
barbarous
accents
'a
night's
lodging'
i
replied
'and
i'm
willing
to
pay
a
good
price
for
it
for
i'm
more
than
half
frozen'
at
this
the
door
opened
wider
and
i
found
myself
confronted
by
a
woman
with
a
candle
she
had
not
the
most
prepossessing
of
expressions
though
her
hair
eyes
and
features
were
decidedly
good
she
was
dressed
with
tawdry
smartness--earrings
necklace
and
rings
and
very
high-heeled
buckle
shoes
indeed
her
costume
was
so
out
of
keeping
with
the
rusticity
of
her
surroundings
as
to
be
quite
extraordinary
this
fact
struck
me
at
once
as
did
her
fingers
which
though
spatulate
and
ugly
had
been
manicured
and
of
course
very
much
over-manicured
for
effect
had
this
not
been
the
case
i
probably
should
not
have
noticed
them
but
the
unnatural
gloss
on
them
exaggerated
by
the
candlelight
made
me
look
and
i
was
at
once
impressed
with
the
criminal
formation
of
the
fingers--the
club-shaped
ends
denoted
something
very
bad--something
homicidal--and
as
my
eyes
wandered
from
the
hands
to
the
face
i
saw
with
a
thrill
of
horror
that
the
ears
were
set
low
down
and
far
back
on
the
head
and
that
the
eyes
gleamed
with
the
sinister
glitter
of
the
wolf
still
i
must
take
my
chance--the
woman
or
the
wood--it
had
to
be
one
of
the
two
'if
you'll
step
inside
monsieur'
she
said
'i'll
see
what
can
be
done
for
you
we
have
only
recently
come
here
and
the
house
is
anyhow
at
present
still
if
you
don't
mind
roughing
it
a
little
we
can
let
you
have
a
bed
and
you
can
rely
upon
me
that
it
is
clean
and
well-aired'
i
followed
her
eagerly
and
she
led
me
down
a
narrow
passage
into
a
big
room
with
a
low
ceiling
traversed
with
a
ponderous
oak
beam
blackened
with
the
smoke
of
endless
peat
fires
before
the
blazing
faggots
on
the
hearth
sat
a
burly-looking
individual
in
a
blue
blouse
on
our
arrival
he
arose
and
as
his
huge
form
towered
above
me
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
anyone
quite
so
hideous
nor
so
utterly
unlike
the
orthodox
frenchman
obeying
his
injunction--for
i
can
scarcely
call
it
an
invitation--to
sit
down
i
took
a
seat
by
the
fire
and
warming
my
half-frozen
limbs
waited
impatiently
whilst
the
woman
made
up
my
bed
and
prepared
supper
the
storm
had
now
reached
cyclonic
dimensions
and
under
its
stupendous
fury
the
whole
house--stoutly
built
though
it
was--swayed
on
its
foundations
the
howling
of
the
wind
in
the
rude
old-fashioned
chimney
and
along
the
passage
and
the
frenzied
beating
of
the
snow
against
the
diamond
window-panes
deadened
all
other
noises
and
rendered
any
attempt
at
conversation
absolutely
abortive
so
i
ate
my
meal
in
silence
pretending
not
to
notice
the
subtle
interchange
of
glances
that
constantly
took
place
between
the
strangely
assorted
pair
whether
they
were
husband
and
wife
what
the
man
did
for
a
living
were
questions
that
continually
occurred
to
me
and
i
found
my
eyes
incessantly
wandering
to
the
numerous
packing-cases
piles
of
carpets
casks
and
other
articles
which
corroborated
the
woman's
statement
that
they
had
but
recently
'moved
in'
once
i
attempted
to
empty
the
coffee
which
was
black
and
peculiarly
bitter
under
the
table
but
had
to
desist
as
i
saw
the
man's
devilish
eyes
fixed
searchingly
on
me
i
then
pushed
aside
the
cup
and
on
the
woman
asking
if
it
was
not
to
my
liking
i
shouted
out
that
i
was
not
in
the
least
thirsty
after
this
incident
the
covert
looks
became
more
numerous
and
my
suspicions
increased
accordingly
at
the
first
opportunity
i
got
up
and
signalling
my
intention
to
go
to
bed
was
preparing
to
leave
my
seat
when
my
host
walking
to
a
cupboard
fetched
out
a
bottle
of
cognac
and
pouring
out
a
tumbler
handed
it
me
with
a
mien
that
i
dare
not
refuse
the
woman
then
led
me
up
a
flight
of
rickety
wooden
steps
and
into
a
sepulchral-looking
chamber
with
no
other
furniture
in
it
save
a
long
narrow
iron
bedstead
a
dilapidated
washstand
a
very
unsteady
common
deal
table
on
which
was
a
looking-glass
and
a
collar
stud
and
a
rush-bottomed
chair
setting
the
candlestick
on
the
dressing-table
and
assuring
me
again
that
the
bed
was
well
aired
my
hostess
withdrew
observing
as
she
left
the
room
that
she
would
get
me
a
nice
breakfast
and
call
me
at
seven
at
seven
how
i
wished
it
was
seven
now
as
i
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
floor
shivering--for
the
room
was
icy
cold
i
suddenly
saw
a
dark
shadow
emerge
from
a
remote
corner
of
the
room
and
slide
surreptitiously
towards
the
door
where
it
halted
my
eyes
then
fell
on
the
lock
and
i
perceived
that
there
was
no
key
no
key
and
that
evil-looking
pair
below
i
must
barricade
the
door
somehow
yet
with
what
there
was
nothing
of
any
weight
in
the
room
nothing
i
began
to
feel
horribly
tired
and
sleepy--so
sleepy
that
it
was
only
with
supreme
effort
i
could
prevent
my
eyelids
closing
ah
i
had
it--a
wedge
i
had
a
knife
of
wood
there
was
plenty--a
piece
off
the
washstand
table
or
chair
anything
would
suffice
i
essayed
to
struggle
to
the
chair
my
limbs
tottered
my
eyelids
closed
then
the
shadow
from
the
doorway
moved
towards
and
through
me
and
with
the
coldness
of
its
passage
i
revived
with
desperate
energy
i
cut
a
couple
of
chunks
off
the
washstand
and
paring
them
down
eventually
succeeded
in
slipping
them
in
the
crack
of
the
door
and
rendering
it
impossible
to
open
from
the
outside
that
done
i
staggered
to
the
bed
and
falling
dressed
as
i
was
on
the
counterpane
sank
into
a
deep
sleep
how
long
i
slept
i
cannot
say
i
suddenly
heard
the
loud
neighing
of
a
horse
which
seemed
to
come
from
just
under
my
window
and
as
in
a
vision
saw
by
my
side
in
the
bed
a
something
which
gradually
developed
into
the
figure
of
a
man
the
counterpart
of
the
mysterious
being
in
the
shaggy
coat
who
had
guided
me
to
the
house
he
was
fully
dressed
sound
asleep
and
breathing
heavily
as
i
was
looking
a
dark
shadow
fell
across
the
sleeper's
face
and
on
glancing
up
i
perceived
to
my
horror
a
black
something
crawling
on
the
floor
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
until
it
reached
the
side
of
the
bed
when
i
immediately
recognized
the
evil
smirking
face
of
my
hostess
in
one
hand
she
held
a
lamp
and
in
the
other
a
horn-handled
knife
setting
the
lamp
on
the
floor
she
coolly
undid
the
collar
of
the
sleeping
man
and
i
saw
a
stud
the
counterpart
of
the
one
on
the
dressing-table
fall
on
the
bare
boards
with
a
sharp
tap
and
disappear
in
the
surrounding
darkness
then
the
woman
felt
the
edge
of
the
knife
with
her
repulsive
thumb
and
calmly
cut
the
helpless
man's
throat
i
screamed--and
the
murderess
and
her
victim
instantly
vanished--and
i
realized
i
was
alone
in
the
room
and
very
much
awake
whether
all
that
had
occurred
was
a
dream
i
cannot
say
with
certainty
though
i
am
inclined
to
think
not
for
some
minutes
my
heart
pulsated
painfully
and
then
as
the
sound
of
its
throbbing
grew
fainter
and
fainter
i
heard
a
curious
noise
outside
my
room--someone
was
ascending
the
stairs
i
endeavoured
to
rise
but
could
not--fear
an
awful
ungovernable
fear
held
me
spellbound
the
steps
paused
outside
the
door
the
handle
of
which
was
gently
turned
then
there
was
a
suggestive
silence
then
whispering
then
another
turning
of
the
handle
and
then--my
state
of
coma
abruptly
ended
and
i
stepped
noiselessly
out
of
bed
and
crept
to
the
window
i
was
heard
'stop
him'
the
woman
cried
out
'he's
trying
to
escape
use
the
gun'
she
hurled
herself
against
the
door
as
she
spoke
whilst
the
man
tore
downstairs
it
was
now
a
matter
of
seconds
the
slightest
accident
a
hesitation
and
i
was
lost
swinging
open
the
window
i
scrambled
on
the
ledge
and
without
the
slightest
idea
of
the
distance--dropped
there
was
a
brief
rushing
through
air
and
i
alighted--safe
and
sound--on
the
snow
blessed
snow
had
it
not
been
for
the
snow
i
should
in
all
probability
have
hurt
myself
i
alighted
not
an
instant
too
soon
for
hardly
had
i
touched
the
ground
before
my
gigantic
host
came
tearing
round
the
angle
of
the
wall
with
a
lantern
in
one
hand
and
gun
in
the
other
i
immediately
dashed
away
and
thanks
to
the
intense
darkness
of
the
morning--for
it
must
have
been
two
o'clock--had
no
difficulty
in
evading
my
pursuer
who
fired
twice
in
rapid
succession
on
and
on
i
went
sometimes
falling
up
to
my
armpits
in
the
snowdrift
and
sometimes
stunning
myself
against
a
low-hanging
branch
of
a
tree
with
the
first
rays
of
sunlight
however
my
troubles
came
to
an
end
the
snow
had
ceased
falling
and
i
quickly
alighted
on
a
track
which
brought
me
to
a
village
whence
i
obtained
a
conveyance
into
liffre
i
reported
the
affair
to
the
local
police
and
a
party
of
gendarmes
at
once
set
off
to
arrest
the
miscreants
but
alas
they
had
fled
the
house
was
pulled
down
and
on
the
soil
being
excavated
a
dozen
or
more
skeletons
of
men
and
women--all
showing
unmistakable
signs
of
foul
play--together
with
the
remains
of
a
horse
were
found
in
various
parts
of
the
premises
the
place
was
a
veritable
golgotha
i
suppose
the
phantom
horse
and
rider
had
appeared
to
me
with
the
sole
purpose
of
making
their
fate
known
if
so
they
at
all
events
partly
achieved
their
end
though
the
mystery
surrounding
their
identity
was
never
solved
all
the
remains
both
human
and
animal
were
removed
elsewhere
and
accorded
a
decent
burial
the
site
of
their
original
interment
however
is
i
believe
still
haunted
and
maybe
will
remain
so
till
the
miscreants
are
brought
to
book
brief
summary
after
a
little
consideration
i
am
inclined
to
think
there
are
quite
as
many
authentic
cases
of
hauntings
by
the
phantasms
of
horses
as
by
the
phantasms
of
cats
and
dogs
innumerable
horses
die
unnatural
deaths
apart
from
those
killed
in
war
many--more
particularly
it
is
true
in
the
olden
times--have
been
murdered
in
the
highways
along
with
their
masters
whilst
all
but
the
comparative
few
when
no
longer
of
use
to
their
owners
are
butchered
in
the
slaughter-house
and
subsequently
despatched
to
the
zoological
gardens
to
be
eaten
by
lions
and
tigers
so
much
for
christianity
and
for
man's
gratitude
how
much
better
would
the
promoters
of
the
white
slave
traffic
act
be
employed
if--instead
of
trying
to
pass
a
bill
which
obviously
cannot
cure
the
evil
it
aims
at
but
can
only
by
diverting
the
course
of
that
evil
drive
from
pillar
to
post
thousands
of
defenceless
albeit
erring
women--they
were
to
labour
to
secure
a
peaceful
ending
for
our
four-footed
toilers
who
work
for
us
all
their
lives
never
strike
never
think
of
a
pension
for
old
age
and
never
even
dream
of
a
vote
alas
if
only
our
poor
horses
could
vote
what
a
different
attitude
would
our
pharisaical
politicians
at
once
adopt
towards
them
phantasms
of
living
horses
from
what
i
have
experienced
and
have
been
told
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
horses
possess
the
same
faculty
of
separating
their
immaterial
from
their
material
bodies
as
cats
and
dogs
i
knew
a
virginian
lady
who
had
a
piebald
horse
that
frequently
appeared
simultaneously
in
two
places
she
lived
in
an
old
country
house
near
winchfield
and
one
morning
when
she
went
into
the
breakfast-room
she
was
surprised
to
see
the
piebald
horse
standing
on
the
gravel
path
outside
the
window
looking
in
at
her
when
she
called
it
by
name
it
immediately
melted
into
fine
air
going
round
to
the
stables
she
found
the
horse
in
its
stall
and
on
enquiry
was
informed
that
it
had
been
there
all
the
time
the
same
thing
frequently
occurred
other
members
of
the
household
besides
herself
witnessing
it
and
so
like
in
all
its
details
was
the
immaterial
horse
to
the
material
that
they
were
often
at
a
loss
to
tell
which
was
which
the
phenomenon
sometimes
occurring
when
the
real
horse
was
awake
and
sometimes
when
it
was
asleep
proves
that
the
animal
possessed
the
faculty
of
projecting
its
spiritual
ego--astral
body
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it--both
consciously
and
unconsciously
i
know
of
many
similar
instances
horses
and
the
psychic
faculty
of
scent
horses
in
a
rather
less
degree
than
cats
and
in
much
the
same
degree
as
dogs
possess
the
property
of
scenting
the
advent
and
presence
of
spirits
on
more
than
one
occasion
when
i
have
been
riding
after
dusk
my
horse
has
suddenly
come
to
an
abrupt
halt
and
shown
unmistakable
signs
of
terror
i
have
not
been
able
to
see
anything
to
account
for
its
conduct
but
on
subsequent
enquiry
have
learned
either
that
a
tragedy
was
actually
known
to
have
taken
place
there
or
that
the
spot
had
long
borne
a
reputation
for
being
haunted
and
my
experiences
are
the
experiences
of
countless
other
people
before
a
death
a
horse
will
often
neigh
repeatedly
outside
the
house
of
the
doomed
person
and
not
infrequently
show
evidences
of
terror
in
passing
close
to
it
from
which
i
deduce
the
horse
can
at
all
events
scent
the
proximity
of
the
phantom
of
death
like
the
dog
however
i
think
it
only
possesses
this
peculiar
psychic
property
in
a
limited
degree
it
can
for
example
readily
detect
the
whereabouts
of
phantasms
haunting
localities
but
not
so
easily
those
haunting
people
it
shows
little
or
no
discrimination
on
sight
between
cruel
and
brutal
people
and
those
who
are
kind
giving
the
same
amount
of
passing
space
to
the
one
as
it
does
to
the
other
yet
on
the
other
hand
i
have
watched
horses
at
night
standing
in
the
fields
their
heads
thrown
back
a
transfixed
far-off
expression
in
their
eyes
sniffing
the
atmosphere--and
snuffling
it
in
a
manner
that
strongly
suggested
to
me
they
were
carrying
on
by
means
of
some
silent
secret
code
a
conversation
with
some
superphysical
presence
which
they
either
saw
or
scented
very
likely
both
scent
i
am
convinced
is
the
medium
of
conversation
not
only
between
superphysical
animals
but
between
material
animals
and
if
we
ever
wish
to
converse
with
spirits
we
must
employ
cats
dogs
and
horses
to
teach
us
phantom
coaches
there
are
few
parts
of
the
british
isles--few
countries
in
europe--which
have
not
their
phantom
coaches
perhaps
the
most
famous
are
those
that
haunt
a
road
near
newport
south
wales
and
an
old
highway
in
devon
a
spectre
coach
and
horses
in
pembrokeshire
miss
mary
l
lewes
in
an
article
called
some
more
welsh
ghosts
that
appeared
in
the
occult
review
for
december
1907
writes
thus--
in
common
with
several
other
districts
in
great
britain
and
ireland
pembrokeshire
possesses
a
good
'phantom
coach'
legend
localized
in
the
southern
part
of
the
county
at
a
place
where
four
roads
meet
called
sampson
cross
in
old
days
the
belated
farmer
driving
home
in
his
gig
from
market
was
apt
to
cast
a
nervous
glance
over
his
shoulder
as
his
pony
slowly
climbed
the
last
pitch
leading
up
to
the
cross
for
tradition
says
that
every
night
a
certain
lady
z
who
lived
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
whose
monument
is
in
the
church
close
by
drives
over
from
tenby
ten
miles
distant
in
a
coach
drawn
by
headless
horses
guided
by
a
headless
coachman
she
also
has
no
head
and
arriving
by
midnight
at
sampson
cross
the
whole
equipage
is
said
to
disappear
in
a
flame
of
fire
with
a
loud
noise
of
explosion
miss
mary
l
lewes
goes
on
to
add--
a
clergyman
living
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
who
told
the
writer
the
story
said
that
some
people
believed
the
ghostly
traveller
had
been
safely
'laid'
many
years
ago
in
the
waters
of
the
lake
not
far
off
he
added
however
that
might
be
it
was
an
odd
fact
that
his
sedate
and
elderly
cob
when
driven
home
past
the
cross
after
nightfall
would
invariably
start
as
if
frightened
there
a
thing
which
never
happened
by
daylight
what
these
kinds
of
spectral
horses
are
no
one
can
say
at
the
most--despite
what
theosophists
and
occultists
may
declare
to
the
contrary--one
can
only
theorize--and
the
speculations
of
one
person
be
he
who
he
may
seem
to
me
to
be
of
no
more
consequence
than
those
of
another
for
my
own
part
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
whereas
in
some
cases
the
ghostly
coach
horses
are
the
phantoms
of
horses
that
were
killed
on
the
highways
in
others
they
are
either
vice-elementals
or
elementals
whose
particular
function
it
is
to
prognosticate
death--either
the
death
of
those
who
see
them
or
the
death
of
someone
connected
with
those
who
see
them
a
phantom
horse
and
policeman
according
to
one
of
my
correspondents
mr
t----
p----
a
comparatively
modern
phantom
rider
has
been
seen
in
canada
writing
to
me
from
c----
where
he
lives
he
says
it
is
stated
that
this
town
is
periodically
haunted
by
the
phantom
of
a
tall
fair
policeman
mounted
on
a
white
horse
and
clothed
in
the
uniform
of
the
'forties--namely
tail
coat
tight
trousers
and
tall
hat
his
'phantom'
beat
extends
from
a
gateway
at
the
commencement
of
cod
hill
along
the
park
side
of
pablo
street
to
sutton
street
and
adam
street
down
dane
street
and
back
through
pablo
street
to
the
gateway
on
cod
hill
a
gentleman
well
known
in
the
art
world
who
in
order
to
avoid
publicity
wishes
to
be
designated
mr
bates
gave
me
his
experience
of
the
phenomena
as
follows--
yes
i
have
seen
the
ghostly
policeman
and
his
milk-white
horse
i
was
walking
along
pablo
street
on
the
park
side
one
grey
afternoon
in
november
with
the
express
intention
of
meeting
a
friend
at
my
club
in
royal
street
when
to
my
surprise
just
as
i
was
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
gateway
on
cod
hill
i
was
overtaken
by
a
tall
fair-haired
man
riding
a
white
horse
he
was
so
dressed
that
i
stared
in
astonishment
he
was
wearing
the
costume
of
seventy
or
eighty
years
ago
and
reminded
me
of
the
policemen
in
cruikshank's
illustrations
of
dickens
i
was
not
frightened
because
i
thought
he
must
be
someone
masquerading
and
in
my
curiosity
to
see
his
face
i
hastened
my
steps
to
overtake
him
i
failed
for
although
he
appeared
to
be
riding
slowly
hardly
moving
at
all
i
could
not
draw
an
inch
nearer
to
him
this
made
me
think
and
i
examined
him
more
critically
then
i
noticed
several
things
about
him
that
at
first
had
escaped
my
notice
they
were
these
one
that
although
he
was
mounted
he
was
wearing
walking
clothes--he
had
on
long
trousers
and
thick
clumsy
boots
two
that
his
ears
and
neck
were
perfectly
colourless
of
an
unnatural
and
startling
white
three
that
despite
the
incongruity
of
his
attire
no
one
but
myself
seemed
to
see
him
on
he
rode
neither
looking
to
the
left
nor
to
the
right
until
he
came
to
sutton
street
when
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
the
traffic
he
began
to
cross
over
there
were
crowds
of
vehicles
passing
at
the
time
and
one
of
them
rushed
right
on
him
making
sure
he
would
be
killed
i
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
horror
judge
then
of
my
amazement
when
instead
of
seeing
him
lying
on
the
ground
crushed
out
of
all
shape
i
saw
him
still
riding
on
as
leisurely
and
unconcernedly
as
if
he
had
been
on
a
country
road
the
vehicle
had
passed
right
through
him
though
i
had
hitherto
scoffed
at
ghosts
i
was
now
certain
i
had
seen
one
and
suddenly
becoming
conscious
how
very
cold
it
was
i
tore
on
not
feeling
at
all
comfortable
till
i
had
reached
the
warm
cheery
and
thoroughly
material
quarters
of
my
club
to
corroborate
the
evidence
of
mr
bates
i
append
a
narrative
given
me
verbally
by
miss
hartly
who
like
mr
bates
had
up
to
the
time
of
her
experience
posed
as
a
pronounced
and
somewhat
bitter
sceptic
she
was
an
emphatic
freethinker
and
had
then
no
belief
whatsoever
in
a
future
life
now
she
believes
a
sight
more
than
most
people
one
afternoon
in
february
1911
she
stated
just
as
twilight
was
commencing
i
left
the
park
where
i
had
been
exercising
my
dog
and
turning
into
pablo
street
made
for
bright
street
at
the
corner
of
wolf
street
i
saw
something
so
strange
that
i
involuntarily
halted
riding
slowly
along
on
a
big
white
horse
a
few
paces
ahead
of
me
was
an
enormous
policeman
in
the
quaint
attire
of
the
'forties--top
hat
tail
coat
tight
trousers
just
as
i
had
so
often
seen
portrayed
in
old
books
he
was
riding
stiffly
as
if
unaccustomed
to
the
saddle
and
kept
looking
rigidly
in
front
of
him
thinking
it
was
someone
doing
it
either
for
a
joke
or
a
wager
i
was
greatly
tickled
and
kept
saying
to
myself
'well
you
are
a
sport
an
a1
sport'
i
tried
to
catch
him
up
to
see
how
he
made
up
his
face
but
could
not
for
although
the
horse
never
seemed
to
quicken
its
pace--a
mere
crawl--and
i
ran
it
nevertheless
maintained
precisely
the
same
distance
in
front
of
me
when
we
had
progressed
in
this
fashion
some
hundred
or
so
yards
i
perceived
a
city
policeman
advancing
towards
us
'come
now'
i
said
to
myself
'we
shall
see
some
fun--the
1911
copper
meeting
the
peeler
of
1840
i
wonder
what
he
will
think
of
him'
to
my
intense
astonishment
however
neither
even
as
much
as
gave
the
other
a
fleeting
glance
but
passed
by
unmoved
and
to
all
appearance
wholly
unconscious
of
each
other
a
few
yards
further
i
espied
a
negro
looking
intently
in
a
store
window
just
as
the
strange
policeman
came
up
to
him
he
gave
a
violent
start
turned
round
and
stared
at
him
gasped
his
cheeks
ashy
pale
his
eyes
bulging
made
some
exclamation
i
could
not
catch
and
dashing
past
me
fled
then
and
not
till
then
did
i
begin
to
feel
funny
further
on
still
we
came
to
a
crossing
a
carriage
and
pair
with
a
coronet
on
the
panels
of
the
door
was
standing
waiting
directly
the
policeman
approached
both
the
horses
reared
so
violently
they
all
but
threw
the
coachman
off
the
box
one
of
the
men
cried
out
'heavens
bill
what's
that'
but
the
other
and
older
of
the
two
who
was
clinging
to
the
reins
with
all
his
might
merely
swore
convinced
now
that
i
was
on
the
trail
of
something
not
human--something
in
all
probability
superphysical
and
impelled
by
a
fascination
i
could
not
resist
i
followed
at
the
top
of
wolf
street
the
policeman
paused
then
crossing
slowly
over
turned
into
dane
street
down
which
he
continued
to
ride
with
the
same
mechanical
and
automatic
tread
at
length
when
within
a
few
feet
of
a
certain
shop
over
which
is
a
flat
that
has
long
borne
a
reputation
for
being
haunted
the
horse
came
to
a
dead
halt
and
horse
and
rider
veering
slowly
round
looked
at
me
what
i
saw
i
shall
never
forget
i
saw
the
faces
of
the
dead--the
long
since
dead
for
some
moments
they
confronted
me
and
then--vanished
vanished
where
they
stood
i
saw
them
again
under
precisely
the
same
conditions
two
days
later
and
i
have
seen
them
once
since
i
am
not
an
imaginative
or
highly-strung
person
but
am
on
the
contrary
exceedingly
practical
and
matter-of-fact
no
better
proof
of
which
i
can
give
than
this
fact--i
am
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
quebec
solicitor
an
irish
haunting
mr
reginald
b
span
in
a
most
interesting
article
called
some
glimpses
of
the
unseen
that
appeared
in
the
occult
review
for
february
1906
writes
as
follows--
another
strange
incident
which
also
occurred
in
ireland
was
told
me
by
a
coachman
in
my
cousin's
employ
at
kilpeacon
near
limerick
this
man
had
previously
been
a
park-keeper
to
lord
doneraile
in
co
cork
one
bright
moonlight
night
he
was
coming
across
lord
doneraile's
park
having
been
round
to
see
that
the
gates
were
shut
when
his
attention
was
drawn
to
the
distant
baying
of
hounds
and
he
stopped
to
listen
as
the
sounds
seemed
to
proceed
from
within
the
park
walls
and
he
knew
there
were
no
hounds
kept
on
the
estate
his
young
son
was
with
him
and
also
heard
the
noise
which
was
getting
louder
and
clearer
and
was
evidently
moving
rapidly
in
their
direction
his
first
idea
was
that
a
pack
of
hounds
which
were
kept
in
the
hunting
kennels
a
few
miles
away
had
escaped
and
had
somehow
got
into
the
park
although
he
had
seen
that
the
gates
were
closed
and
there
was
really
no
way
by
which
they
could
have
entered
the
baying
of
hounds
as
if
in
'full
cry'
sounded
closer
and
closer
and
suddenly
out
of
the
shadow
of
some
trees
a
number
of
foxhounds
running
at
full
speed
appeared
in
the
clear
light
of
the
moon
they
raced
past
the
amazed
spectators
a
whole
pack
of
them
followed
closely
by
an
elderly
man
on
a
large
horse
although
they
came
very
near
no
sound
could
be
heard
but
the
baying
of
one
or
two
of
the
hounds
the
galloping
of
the
horse
was
not
heard
at
all
they
swung
across
the
grass
at
a
tremendous
pace
and
were
lost
to
view
round
the
end
of
a
plantation
the
park-keeper
knew
that
all
the
gates
were
shut
and
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
pack
of
hounds
to
pass
out
and
he
thought
the
mystery
might
be
solved
the
next
day
however
it
never
was
explained--by
any
natural
cause
no
hounds
or
horseman
had
been
in
the
park
the
mansion
was
closed
lord
doneraile
being
away
and
no
one
had
the
right
of
entering
the
grounds
within
the
park
walls
he
heard
later
that
there
was
a
story
in
the
neighbourhood
about
'the
ghost'
of
a
former
lord
doneraile
'haunting'
the
park--and
possibly
the
spectral
horseman
was
he
i
questioned
the
man
and
his
son
closely
about
it
and
am
convinced
they
were
not
deceived
by
hallucination
and
that
their
account
is
perfectly
true
to
this
account
mr
span
adds
this
note--
the
apparition
of
hounds
and
huntsman
was
witnessed
on
an
estate
belonging
to
lord
doneraile
in
the
south
of
ireland
doneraile
park
the
man
who
told
me
the
incident
was
coachman
in
the
service
of
my
cousin
near
limerick
his
young
son
confirmed
his
father's
account
as
he
also
saw
it
yours
faithfully
reginald
b
span
to
throw
additional
light
on
the
matter
mr
ralph
shirley
editor
of
the
occult
review
published
the
following
letter
written
to
him
by
lord
doneraile--
dear
shirley
it
is
rather
a
curious
thing
that
neither
lady
castletown
nor
lady
doneraile
has
ever
heard
of
the
story
of
the
moonlight
vision
of
lord
doneraile
and
the
pack
of
hounds
however
there
is
a
man
at
doneraile
called
jones
a
chemist
who
is
a
most
enthusiastic
antiquarian
and
a
dabbler
in
the
occult
sciences
and
he
takes
the
greatest
interest
in
all
that
concerns
the
st
legers
lady
castletown
wrote
to
him
and
the
reply
comes
from
his
brother
i
suppose
he
is
away
and
that
i
send
you
lady
doneraile
says
it
must
refer
to
the
third
lord
doneraile
of
the
first
creation
who
was
killed
in
a
duel
afterwards
and
there
appear
to
be
a
lot
of
stories
which
jones
has
ferreted
out
or
been
told
of
course
i
don't
know
how
far
you
could
say
jones
was
authentic
all
i
can
say
is
that
he
believes
the
things
himself
yours
sincerely
doneraile
dec
27
1905
i
should
explain
adds
mr
shirley
that
lady
castletown
is
daughter
to
the
late
lord
doneraile
and
present
owner
of
doneraile
house
here
follows
the
enclosure
ie
the
extract
made
by
walter
a
jones
doneraile
from
his
ms
notes
on
the
legends
of
peasantry
in
connection
with
doneraile
branch
of
the
st
leger
family
dated
december
21
1905
i
have
heard
so
it
runs
the
following
story
respecting
the
lord
doneraile
who
pursues
the
chase
from
ballydineen
through
gloun-na-goth
wilkinson's
lawn
through
byblox
across
the
ford
of
shanagh
aha
keel-ahboobleen
into
waskin's
glen
into
the
old
deer
park
at
old
court
thence
into
the
horse
close
and
from
thence
into
the
park
he
appears
to
take
particular
delight
in
wilkinson's
lawn
according
to
tradition
for
it
was
there
that
the
noble
stag
was
lost
sight
of
and
of
course
it
was
there
he
was
most
searched
for
it
was
only
last
autumn
that
two
gentlemen
were
going
to
a
fair
as
i
heard
and
leading
a
very
fine
horse
behind
the
trap
the
night
being
fine
and
moonlight
they
stopped
at
the
iron
gate
there
to
light
their
pipes
when
a
gentleman
dressed
in
old
style
with
buckskin
leggings
walked
through
the
iron
gate
though
closed
and
patted
the
led
horse
on
the
neck
they
both
agreed
that
he
was
most
like
to
gentlemen
of
the
st
leger
family
whom
they
had
known
the
radiant
boy
also
appears
here
and
for
years
in
the
early
part
of
last
century
no
one
would
pass
there
after
nightfall
the
lord
doneraile
who
is
believed
by
the
peasantry
to
stand
under
lord
doneraile's
oak
it
has
been
told
me
positively
was
third
viscount
there
is
an
old
man
called
reardon
here
now
who
saw
a
gentleman
riding
a
powerful
black
horse
along
lord
doneraile's
route
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
his
sister
who
was
with
him
failed
to
see
the
horseman
though
her
brother
had
to
pull
her
out
of
his
way
i
went
up
to
saffron
hill
last
winter
to
see
the
ostrich-like
ghost
which
is
there
and
i
heard
a
great
sweep
as
of
hounds
and
horses
going
past
me
paddy
shea
late
herd
to
lord
doneraile
also
would
swear
he
saw
the
phantom
lord
doneraile
pursuing
the
chase
often
i
have
heard
that
james
mullaine
also
saw
him
in
wilkinson's
lawn
but
have
not
any
further
proof
it
is
very
few
people
will
admit
having
seen
these
things
george
buckley
present
keeper
of
the
doneraile
park
got
a
great
fright
one
night
which
might
have
been
from
the
same
cause
in
this
case
it
seems
more
than
likely
the
huntsman
horse
and
hounds
were
all
bona
fide
phantasms
of
the
dead
wild
darrell
littlecote
as
everyone
knows
is
haunted
by
the
spirits
of
the
notorious
wild
will
darrell
and
the
horse
he
invariably
rode
and
which
eventually
broke
his
neck
but
there
are
many
wild
darrells
all
europe
is
overrun
by
them
they
nightly
tear
on
their
phantom
horses
over
the
german
and
norwegian
forests
and
moor-lands
that
echo
and
re-echo
with
their
hoarse
shouts
and
the
mournful
baying
of
their
grisly
hounds
many
travellers
in
russia
and
germany
journeying
through
the
forests
at
night
have
caught
the
sound
of
wails--of
moans
that
starting
from
the
far
distance
have
gradually
come
nearer
and
nearer
then
they
have
heard
the
winding
of
a
horn
the
shouting
and
cursing
of
the
huntsman
and
in
a
biting
cold
wind
have
seen
the
whole
cavalcade
sweep
by
according
to
various
authorities
on
the
subject
this
spectral
chase
goes
by
different
names
in
thuringia
and
elsewhere
it
is
hakelnberg
or
hackelnbarend--the
story
being
that
hakelnberg
a
german
knight
who
had
devoted
his
whole
life
to
the
chase
on
his
death-bed
had
told
the
officiating
priest
that
he
cared
not
a
jot
for
heaven
but
only
for
hunting
the
priest
losing
patience
and
exclaiming
then
hunt
till
doomsday
so
in
all
weathers
in
snow
and
ice
hakelnberg
his
horse
and
hounds
are
seen
careering
after
imaginary
game
there
are
similar
stories
current
in
the
netherlands
denmark
russia
and
practically
all
over
europe
and
not
only
europe
but
in
many
of
the
states
and
departments
of
the
new
world
this
being
so
i
think
there
must
be
a
substantial
substratum
of
truth
underlying
the
beliefs
phantastic
as
they
may
appear
and
yet
are
no
more
phantastic
than
many
of
the
stories
we
are
asked
to
give
absolute
credence
to
in
the
bible
in
old
castile
the
spirit
of
a
moorish
leader
who
won
many
victories
over
the
spaniards
and
was
drowned
by
reason
of
his
heavy
armour
in
a
swamp
of
the
river
duero
still
haunts
his
burial-place
a
piece
of
marshy
ground
near
burgos
there
weird
noises
such
as
the
winding
of
a
huntsman's
horn
and
the
neighing
of
a
horse
are
heard
and
the
phantasm
of
the
dead
moor
is
seen
mounted
on
a
white
horse
followed
by
twelve
huge
black
hounds
in
sweden
many
of
the
peasants
say
when
a
noise
like
that
of
a
coach
and
horses
is
heard
rumbling
past
in
the
dead
of
night
it
is
the
white
rider
whilst
in
norway
they
say
of
the
same
sounds
it
is
the
hunt
of
the
devil
and
his
four
horses
in
saxony
the
rider
is
believed
to
be
barbarossa
the
celebrated
hero
of
olden
days
near
fontainebleau
hugh
capet
is
stated
to
ride
a
gigantic
sable
horse
to
the
palace
where
he
hunted
before
the
assassination
of
henry
iv
and
in
the
landes
the
rider
is
thought
to
be
judas
iscariot
in
other
parts
of
france
the
wild
huntsman
is
known
as
harlequin
or
henequin
and
in
some
parts
of
brittany
he
is
herod
in
pursuit
of
the
holy
innocents
alas
that
no
such
herod
visits
london
how
welcome
would
he
be
were
he
only
to
flout

few
of
the
brawling
brats

go
anywhere

please
make
an
inferno
of
every
road

choose
to
play
in

my
notes
on
horses
end
and
although
the
evidence
i
have
offered
may
have
failed
to
convince
many
i
myself
am
fully
satisfied
that
these
noble
and
indispensable
animals
do
not
terminate
their
existence
in
this
world
but
pass
on
to
another
and
let
us
all
sincerely
hope
far
happier

bulls

pigs
etc
from
the
hebrides
there
comes
to
me
a
case
of
the
phantasm
of
a
black
bull
that
on
certain
nights
in
the
year
is
heard
bellowing
inside
the
shed
where
it
was
killed
there
are
many
accounts
of
ghostly
cows
heard
mooing
in
the
moors
and
bog-lands
of
scotland
and
ireland
respectively
and
not
a
few
cases
of
whole
herds
of
phantom
cattle
seen
gliding
along
one
behind
the
other
with
silent
noiseless
tread
though
i
have
never
had
the
opportunity
of
experimenting
with
cows
to
see
if
they
are
sensitive
to
the
superphysical
i
see
no
reason
why
they
should
not
be
and
i
feel
quite
certain
they
will
participate

the
future

believed
to
haunt
many
churches
sometimes
it
is
a
pig
sometimes
a
horse
the
haunting
spectre
being
the
spirit
of
an
animal
buried
alive
in
the
churchyard
for
the
purpose
of
scaring
away
the
sacrilegious
mr
dyer
goes
on
to
say
that
it
was
the
custom
of
the
old
christian
churches
to
bury
a
lamb
under
the
altar
and
that
if
anyone
entered
a
church
out
of
service
time
and
happened
to
see
a
little
lamb
spring
across
the
choir
and
vanish
it
was
a
sure
prognostication
of
the
death
of
some
child
and
if
this
apparition
was
seen
by
the
grave-digger
the
death
would
take
place
immediately
mr
dyer
also
tells
us
that
the
danish
kirk-grim
was
thought
to
hide
itself
in
the
tower
of
a
church
in
preference
to
any
other
place
and
that
it
was
thought
to
protect
the
sacred
buildings
according
to
the
same
writer
in
the
streets
of
kroskjoberg
a
grave
sow
or
as
it
was
called
a
gray-sow
was
frequently
seen
and
it
was
said
to
be
the
apparition
of
a
sow
formerly
buried
alive
its
appearance
foretelling
death
or
calamity
phantasm
of
a
goat
mrs
crowe
in
her
night
side
of
nature
relates
one
case
of
a
house
near
philadelphia
usa
that
was
haunted
by
a
variety
of
phenomena
among
others
that
of
a
spectre
resembling
a
goat
other
extraordinary
things
happened
in
the
house
she
writes
which
had
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
although
the
son
had
not
believed
it
and
had
thereupon
not
mentioned
the
report
to
the
father
one
day
the
children
said
they
had
been
running
after
'such
a
queer
thing
in
the
cellar
it
was
like
a
goat
and
not
like
a
goat
but
it
seemed
to
be
like
a
shadow'
this
explanation
does
not
appear
to
be
very
satisfactory
but
as
i
have
heard
of
one
or
two
other
cases
of
premises
being
haunted
by
what
undoubtedly
were
the
phantasms
of
goats
i
think
it
highly
probable
it
was
the
ghost
of
a
goat
in
this
instance
too
the
phantom
pigs
of
the
chiltern
hills
a
good
many
years
ago
there
was
a
story
current
of
an
extraordinary
haunting
by
a
herd
of
pigs
the
chief
authority
on
the
subject
was
a
farmer
who
was
an
eye-witness
of
the
phenomena
i
will
call
him
mr
b
mr
b
as
a
boy
lived
in
a
small
house
called
the
moat
grange
which
was
situated
in
a
very
lonely
spot
near
four
cross-roads
connecting
four
towns
the
house
deriving
its
name
from
the
fact
that
a
moat
surrounded
it
stood
near
the
meeting
point
of
the
four
roads
which
was
the
site
of
a
gibbet
the
bodies
of
the
criminals
being
buried
in
the
moat
well
the
b----s
had
not
been
living
long
on
the
farm
before
they
were
awakened
one
night
by
hearing
the
most
dreadful
noises
partly
human
and
partly
animal
seemingly
proceeding
from
a
neighbouring
spinney
and
on
going
to
a
long
front
window
overlooking
the
cross-roads
they
saw
a
number
of
spotted
creatures
like
pigs
screaming
fighting
and
tearing
up
the
soil
on
the
site
of
the
criminals'
cemetery
the
sight
was
so
unexpected
and
alarming
that
the
b----s
were
appalled
and
mr
b
was
about
to
strike
a
light
on
the
tinder-box
when
the
most
diabolical
white
face
was
pressed
against
the
outside
of
the
window-pane
and
stared
in
at
them
this
was
the
climax
the
children
shrieked
with
terror
and
mrs
b
falling
on
her
knees
began
to
pray
whereupon
the
face
at
the
window
vanished
and
the
herd
of
pigs
ceasing
their
disturbance
tore
frantically
down
one
of
the
high
roads
and
disappeared
from
view
similar
phenomena
were
seen
and
heard
so
frequently
afterwards
that
the
b----s
eventually
had
to
leave
the
farm
and
subsequent
enquiries
led
to
their
learning
that
the
place
had
long
borne
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
the
ghosts
being
supposed
to
be
the
earth-bound
spirits
of
the
executed
criminals
whether
this
was
so
or
not
must
of
course
be
a
matter
of
conjecture--the
herd
of
hogs
may
well
have
been
the
phantasms
of
actual
earth-bound
pigs--attracted
to
the
spot
by
a
sort
of
fellow-feeling
for
the
criminals
whose
gross
and
carnal
natures
would
no
doubt
appeal
to
them
a
lane
in
hertfordshire
was--and
perhaps
still
is--haunted
by
the
phantasm
of
a
big
white
sow
which
had
accidentally
been
run
over
and
killed
it
was
occasionally
heard
grunting
and
had
the
unpleasant
knack
of
approaching
one
noiselessly
from
the
rear
and
of
making
the
most
unearthly
noise
just
behind
one's
back
sheep
lambs
and
sheep
possessing
finer
natures
than
goats
and
pigs
would
appear
to
be
less
earth-bound
and
in
all
probability
only
temporarily
haunt
the
spots
that
witnessed
their
usually
barbarous
ends
most
slaughter-houses
are
haunted
by
them--as
indeed
by
many
other
animals
a
scottish
moor
long
bore
the
reputation
for
being
haunted
by
a
phantom
flock
of
sheep
which
were
always
heard
baaing
plaintively
before
a
big
storm
it
was
supposed
they
were
the
ghosts
of
a
flock
that
had
perished
in
the
memorable
severe
weather
of
christmas
1880
here
is
a
case
that
may
be
regarded
as
typical
of
hauntings
by
sheep
presumably
the
earth-bound
spirits
of
sheep
overwhelmed
in
some
great
storm
or
unexpected
catastrophe
the
spectre
flock
of
sheep
in
germany
during
the
seven
years'
war
in
germany
writes
mrs
crowe
in
her
night
side
of
nature
a
drover
lost
his
life
in
a
drunken
squabble
on
the
high
road
for
some
time
there
was
a
sort
of
rude
tombstone
with
a
cross
on
it
to
mark
the
spot
where
his
body
was
interred
but
this
has
long
fallen
and
a
milestone
now
fills
its
place
nevertheless
it
continues
to
be
commonly
asserted
by
the
country
people
and
also
by
various
travellers
that
they
have
been
deluded
on
that
spot
by
seeing
as
they
imagine
herds
of
beasts
which
on
investigation
prove
to
be
merely
visionary
of
course
many
people
look
upon
this
as
a
superstition
but
a
very
regular
confirmation
of
the
story
occurred
in
the
year
1826
when
two
gentlemen
and
two
ladies
were
passing
the
spot
in
a
post-carriage
one
of
these
was
a
clergyman
and
none
of
them
had
ever
heard
of
the
phenomenon
said
to
be
attached
to
the
place
they
had
been
discussing
the
prospects
of
the
minister
who
was
on
his
way
to
a
vicarage
to
which
he
had
just
been
appointed
when
they
saw
a
large
flock
of
sheep
which
stretched
quite
across
the
road
and
was
accompanied
by
a
shepherd
and
a
long-haired
black
dog
as
to
meet
cattle
on
that
road
was
nothing
uncommon
and
indeed
they
had
met
several
droves
in
the
course
of
one
day
no
remark
was
made
at
the
moment
till
suddenly
each
looked
at
the
other
and
said
'what's
become
of
the
sheep'
quite
perplexed
at
their
sudden
disappearance
they
called
to
the
postilion
to
stop
and
all
got
out
in
order
to
mount
the
little
elevation
and
look
around
but
still
unable
to
discover
them
they
now
bethought
themselves
of
asking
the
postilion
where
they
were
when
to
their
infinite
surprise
they
learned
that
he
had
not
seen
them
upon
this
they
bade
him
quicken
his
pace
that
they
might
overtake
a
carriage
that
had
passed
them
shortly
before
and
enquire
if
that
party
had
seen
the
sheep
but
they
had
not
four
years
later
a
postmaster
named
j
was
on
the
same
road
driving
a
carriage
in
which
were
a
clergyman
and
his
wife
when
he
saw
a
large
flock
of
sheep
near
the
same
spot
seeing
they
were
very
fine
wethers
and
supposing
them
to
have
been
bought
at
a
sheep-fair
that
was
then
taking
place
a
few
miles
off
j
drew
up
his
reins
and
stopped
his
horses
turning
at
the
same
time
to
the
clergyman
to
say
that
he
wanted
to
enquire
the
price
of
the
sheep
as
he
intended
going
next
day
to
the
fair
himself
whilst
the
minister
was
asking
him
what
sheep
he
meant
j
got
down
and
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
animals
the
size
and
beauty
of
which
astonished
him
they
passed
him
at
an
unusual
rate
whilst
he
made
his
way
through
them
to
find
the
shepherd
when
on
getting
to
the
end
of
the
flock
they
suddenly
disappeared
he
then
first
learnt
that
his
fellow-travellers
had
not
seen
them
at
all
so
writes
mrs
crowe
and
i
quote
the
case
in
support
of
my
argument
that
sheep
like
horses
cats
dogs
and
all
other
kinds
of
animals
possess
spirits
and
consequently
have
a
future
state
of
existence
i
have
not
yet
experimented
with
sheep
goats
or
pigs
but
i
do
not
doubt
but
that
they
are
more
or
less
sensitive
to
superphysical
influences
and
possess
the
psychic
faculty
of
scenting
the
unknown--though
not
perhaps
in
so
great
a
degree
as
any
of
the
other
animals
i
have
enumerated
part
ii
wild
animals
and
the
unknown
wild
animals
and
the
unknown
apes
the
following
case
of
animal
hauntings
was
recorded
in
automatic
writing--
i
sank
wearily
into
my
easy
chair
before
the
fire
which
burned
with
a
fitful
and
sullen
glow
in
the
tiny
grate
of
my
one
room--bare
and
desolate
as
only
the
room
of
an
unsuccessful
author
can
be
my
condition
was
pitiable
for
the
past
twelve
months
i
had
not
earned
a
cent
and
of
my
small
capital
there
now
remained
but
two
pounds
to
ward
the
hound
of
starvation
from
my
door
in
the
moonlight
i
could
perceive
all
the
bareness
of
the
apartment
would
to
god
fancy
would
ride
to
me
on
this
moonbeam
and
give
me
inspiration
'twas
indeed
weird--this
silver
ethereal
path
connecting
the
moon
with
the
earth
and
the
more
i
gazed
along
it
the
more
i
wished
to
leave
my
body
and
escape
to
the
star-lighted
vaults
certainly
from
a
conversation
i
had
once
had
with
a
member
of
the
new
occult
society
i
believed
it
possible
by
concentrating
all
the
mental
activities
in
one
channel
so
to
overcome
the
barriers
which
prevent
the
soul
visiting
scenes
of
the
ethereal
world
as
to
pass
materialized
to
the
spot
upon
which
the
ideas
are
fixed
but
although
i
had
essayed--how
many
times
i
do
not
like
to
confess--to
gain
that
amount
of
concentration
necessary
for
the
separation
of
the
soul
from
the
body
up
to
the
present
all
my
attempts
had
been
fruitless
doubtless
there
had
been
a
something--too
minute
even
for
definition--that
had
interrupted
my
self-abstraction--a
something
that
had
wrecked
my
venture
just
when
i
felt
it
to
be
on
the
verge
of
completion
and
was
it
likely
that
now
when
my
ideas
were
misty
and
vague
i
should
be
more
successful
i
wanted
to
quit
the
cruel
bonds
of
nature
and
be
free--free
to
roam
and
ramble
but
where
at
length
as
i
gazed
into
the
moonlight
i
lost
all
cognizance
of
the
objects
around
me
and
my
eyes
became
fixed
on
the
mountains
of
the
moon
which
i
discovered
with
a
start
were
no
longer
specks
i
found
to
my
amazement
i
had
left
my
body
and
was
careering
swiftly
through
space--infinite
space
the
range
opened
up
in
front
of
me
spreading
out
far
and
wide
winding
black
and
awful--their
solemn
grandeur
lost
in
that
terrible
desolation
which
makes
the
moon
appear
like
a
hideous
nightmare
i
could
see
with
amazing
clearness
the
sides
of
the
mountains
there
were
enormous
black
fissures
some
of
them
hundreds
of
feet
in
width--and
the
more
i
gazed
the
more
impressed
i
grew
with
the
silence
there
was
no
life
there
were
no
seas
no
lakes
no
trees
no
grass
no
sighing
nor
moaning
of
the
wind
nothing
to
remind
me
of
the
earth
i
now
found
to
my
terror
i
had
actually
quitted
everything
around
me
was
black--the
sky
the
mountains
the
vast
pits
the
dried-up
mouths
of
which
gaped
dismally
with
the
movements
of
a
man
in
a
fit
i
essayed
to
hinder
the
finis
of
my
mad
plunge
i
waved
my
limbs
violently
kicking
out
and
shrieking
in
the
agonies
of
fear
i
cursed
and
prayed
wept
and
laughed
alternately
did
everything
yet
nothing
that
could
save
me
from
contact
with
the
lone
desert
so
horribly
close
nearer
and
nearer
i
approached
until
at
last
my
feet
rested
on
the
hard
caked
soil
for
the
first
few
minutes
after
my
arrival
i
was
too
overwhelmed
with
fear
to
do
other
than
remain
stationary
the
ground
beneath
my
feet
swarmed
with
myriads
of
foul
and
long-legged
insects
things
with
unwieldy
pincers
and
protruding
eyes
things
covered
with
scaly
armour
hybrids
of
beetles
and
scorpions
i
have
a
distinct
recollection
of
one
huge-jointed
centipede
making
a
vicious
grab
at
my
leg
he
failed
to
make
his
teeth
meet
in
anything
tangible
and
emitting
a
venomous
hiss
disappeared
in
a
circular
pit
whilst
i
was
the
victim
of
this
insect's
ferocity
the
horizon
had
become
darkened
by
the
shadowy
outline
of
an
enormous
apish
form
i
wanted
to
run
away
but
could
not
and
was
compelled
sorely
against
my
will
to
witness
its
approach
never
shall
i
forget
the
agonies
of
doubt
i
endured
during
its
advance
no
man
in
a
tiger's
den
nor
deer
tied
to
a
tree
awaiting
its
destroyer
could
have
suffered
more
than
i
did
then
and
my
terror
increased
tenfold
when
i
recognized
in
the
monster--neppon--a
young
gorilla
that
had
been
under
my
charge
and
had
given
me
no
end
of
trouble
when
i
was
head
keeper
in
the
zoological
gardens
at
berne
i
never
hated
anything
so
much
as
i
had
hated
that
baboon
at
my
hands
it
had
undergone
a
thousand
subtle
torments
i
had
pinched
it
poked
it
pulled
its
hair
frightened
it
by
putting
on
masks
and
making
all
sorts
of
queer
noises
and
finally
i
had
secretly
poisoned
it
and
now
we
stood
face
to
face
without
any
bars
between
us
never
shall
i
forget
the
look
of
intense
satisfaction
in
its
hideous
eyes
as
its
gaze
encountered
mine
in
that
strange
forlorn
world
we
faced
each
other
i
the
tyrant
once
now
the
quarry
in
the
wildness
of
its
glee
it
capered
about
like
a
mad
thing
executing
the
most
exaggerated
antics
that
augmented
my
terror
every
second
i
anticipated
an
assault
and
the
knowledge
of
my
fears
lent
additional
fierceness
to
its
gambols
a
sudden
change
in
my
attitude
at
length
made
it
cease
the
use
had
returned
to
my
limbs
my
muscles
were
quivering
and
before
it
could
stop
me
i
had
fled
the
wildest
of
chases
then
ensued
i
ran
with
a
speed
that
would
have
shamed
a
record-beater
on
earth
with
extraordinary
nimbleness
i
vaulted
over
titanic
boulders
of
rocks
jumped
across
dykes
of
infinite
depth
scurried
like
lightning
over
tracts
of
rough
lacerating
ground
and
never
for
one
instant
felt
like
flagging
suddenly
to
my
horror
i
came
to
an
abrupt
standstill
and
the
cry
of
some
hunted
animal
burst
from
my
lips
unwittingly
i
had
run
against
a
huge
wall
of
granite
and
escape
was
now
impossible
again
and
again
i
clawed
the
hard
rock
until
the
skin
hung
in
shreds
from
my
fingers
and
the
blood
pattered
on
the
dark
soil
that
in
all
probability
had
never
tasted
moisture
before
all
this
amused
my
pursuer
vastly
it
watched
with
the
leisure
of
one
who
knows
its
fish
will
be
landed
in
safety
and
there
suddenly
came
to
me
through
my
olfactory
nerves
a
knowledge
that
it
was
speaking
to
me
in
the
language
of
scents--the
language
i
never
understood
till
now
was
the
language
of
all
animals
'reach
a
little
higher'
it
said
'there
are
niches
up
there
and
you
must
stretch
your
limbs
ha
ha
do
you
remember
how
you
used
to
make
me
stretch
mine
you
do
well
you
needn't
shiver
explain
to
me
how
it
is
i
find
you
here'
'i
cannot
comprehend'
i
gasped
with
a
gesticulation
that
was
grotesque
the
great
beast
laughed
in
my
face
'how
so'
it
queried
'you
used
to
quibble
me
upon
my
dull
wits
must
i
now
return
the
compliment
ha
there's
blood
on
your
hands
blood
i
will
lick
it
up'
and
with
a
mocking
grin
it
advanced
'keep
off
keep
off'
i
shouted
'my
god
will
this
dream
never
cease'
'the
dream
as
you
call
it'
the
gorilla
jeered
'has
only
just
begun
the
climax
of
your
horrors
has
yet
to
come
if
you
cannot
tell
me
the
purport
of
your
visit
i
will
tell
you
mine
can
your
lordship
spare
the
time
to
listen'
i
gave
no
answer
i
clutched
the
wall
and
uttered
incoherent
cries
like
some
frightened
madman
the
gorilla
felt
the
muscles
in
its
hairy
fingers
and
showed
its
huge
teeth
i
looked
eagerly
at
my
enemy
'come
you
haven't
yet
guessed
my
riddle
you
are
dull
to-night'
it
said
lightly
'that
old
wine
of
yours
made
you
sleep
too
soundly
don't
let
me
disturb
you
i
will
explain
this
moon
is
now
my
home--i
share
it
with
the
spirits
of
all
the
animals
and
insects
that
were
once
on
your
earth
and
now
that
we
are
free
from
such
as
you--free
to
wander
anywhere
we
like
without
fear
of
being
shot
or
caught
and
caged--we
are
happy
and
what
makes
us
still
happier
is
the
knowledge
that
the
majority
of
men
and
women
will
never
have
a
joyous
after-state
like
ours
they
will
be
earth-bound
in
that
miserable
world
of
theirs
and
compelled
to
keep
to
their
old
haunts
scaring
to
death
with
their
ugly
faces
all
who
have
the
misfortune
to
see
them
there
is
another
fate
in
store
for
you
however
do
you
know
what
it
is'
it
paused
no
sound
other
than
that
occasioned
by
his
bumping
on
the
soil
broke
the
impressive
hush
'do
you
know'
it
said
again
'well
i
will
tell
you
i'm
going
to
kill
you
right
away
so
that
your
spirit--it's
all
nonsense
to
talk
about
souls
such
as
you
have
no
soul--will
be
earth-bound
here--here
for
ever--and
will
be
a
perpetual
source
of
amusement
to
all
of
us
animal
ghosts'
it
then
began
to
jabber
ferociously
and
crouching
down
prepared
to
spring
'for
heaven's
sake'
i
shrieked
'for
heaven's
sake'
but
i
might
as
well
have
appealed
to
the
wind
it
had
no
sense
of
mercy
'he
he'
it
screamed
'what
a
joke--what
a
splendid
joke
your
wit
never
seems
to
degenerate
hugesson
i'm
wondering
if
you
will
be
as
funny
when
you're
a
ghost
get
ready
i'm
coming
coming'
and
as
the
sky
deepened
to
an
awe-inspiring
black
and
the
stars
grew
larger
brighter
fiercer
and
the
great
lone
deserts
appealed
to
me
with
a
force
unequalled
before
it
sprang
through
the
air
a
singing
in
my
ears
and
a
great
bloody
mist
rose
before
my
eyes
the
wailing
and
screeching
of
a
million
souls
was
borne
in
loud
protracted
echoings
through
the
drum
of
my
ears
men
and
women
with
evil
faces
rose
up
from
crag
and
boulder
to
spit
and
tear
at
me
i
saw
creatures
of
such
damning
ugliness
that
my
soul
screamed
aloud
with
terror
and
then
from
the
mountain
tops
the
bolt
of
heaven
was
let
loose
every
spirit
was
swept
away
like
chaff
before
the
burst
of
wind
that
hurling
and
shrieking
bore
down
upon
me
i
gave
myself
up
for
lost
i
felt
all
the
agonies
of
suffocation
my
lungs
were
torn
from
my
palpitating
body
my
legs
wrenched
round
in
their
sockets
my
feet
whirled
upwards
in
that
gust
of
devilish
air
all--excruciating
damning
pain--and
pro
tempore--i
knew
no
more





nb--it
was
subsequently
ascertained
by
my
friend
the
late
mr
supton
that
a
man
named
hugesson
who
had
been
for
a
short
time
head
keeper
at
the
zoological
gardens
had
been
found
dead
in
bed
by
his
landlady
with
a
look
on
his
face
so
awful
that
she
had
fled
shrieking
from
the
room
the
death
was
of
course
attributed
to
syncope
but
my
friend--who
by
the
way
had
never
heard
of
hugesson
before
he
received
the
foregoing
account
through
the
medium
of
planchette--told
me
and
i
agreed
with
him
that
from
similar
cases
that
had
come
within
his
experience
it
was
most
probable
that
hugesson
had
in
reality
projected
himself
and
had
perished
in
the
manner
described
no
more
improbable
than
the
above
story
is
that
sent
me
by
my
old
school
friend
martin
tristram
who
died
last
year
i
style
it
the
case
of
martin
tristram
it
is
reproduced
from
a
magazine
published
some
three
years
ago
after
martin
tristram
once
took
up
spiritualism
his
visits
to
me
became
most
erratic
and
i
not
only
never
knew
when
to
expect
him
but
i
was
not
always
sure
when
he
did
come
that
it
was
he
this
sounds
extraordinary--to
see
a
man
is
assuredly
to
recognize
him
not
always--by
no
means
always
there
are
circumstances
in
which
a
man
loses
his
identity
when
his
ego
is
supplanted
by
another
ego
when
he
ceases
to
be
himself
and
assumes
an
individuality
which
is
entirely
different
from
himself
this
is
undoubtedly
the
case
in
madness
imbecility
epilepsy
so-called
total
loss
of
memory
through
cerebral
injury
hypnotism
sometimes
in
projection
when
the
astral
body
gets
detained
and
also
not
infrequently
in
investigating
peculiar
instances
of
psychic
phenomena
but
if
the
astral
body
has
been
evicted
from
its
carnal
home
whither
has
it
gone
and
what
is
the
nature
of
the
thing
that
has
taken
its
place
ah
these
are
indeed
puzzles--puzzles
i
am
devoting
a
lifetime
to
solve
there
have
been
moments
when
unseen
hands
have
gradually
begun
to
pull
aside
the
obscuring
veil
when
the
identity
of
the
usurping
spirit
has
seemed
on
the
verge
of
being
disclosed
to
me
and
i
have
been
about
to
be
initiated
into
the
greatest
and
most
zealously
guarded
of
all
secrets
there
have
been
times
i
say
when
my
occult
researches
have
actually
brought
me
to
this
climax
but
up
to
the
present
i
have
invariably
been
disappointed--the
curtain
has
suddenly
fallen
the
esoteric
ego
has
shrunk
into
its
shell
and
the
mystery
surrounding
it
has
remained
impenetrable
this
is
but
one
albeit
perhaps
the
most
striking
of
the
many
methods
through
which
the
superphysical
endeavours
to
get
in
immediate
contact
with
the
physical
i
was
unpleasantly
reminded
of
it
when
martin
tristram's
carnal
body
came
to
visit
me
one
night
several
years
ago
i
was
aware
that
it
was
not
tristram
his
mannerisms
were
the
same
his
voice
had
not
altered
but
there
was
an
expression
in
his
eyes
that
told
of
a
very
different
spirit
from
martin's
dwelling
within
that
body
the
night
being
cold
he
closed
the
door
carefully
and
crossing
the
room
to
where
i
sat
by
the
fire
threw
himself
in
an
easy
chair
and
gazed
meditatively
at
me
my
rooms
in
bloomsbury
were
not
lonely
they
had
more
than
their
share
of
brawling
brats
on
either
side
there
were
no
gloomy
recesses
or
ghost-suggestive
cupboards
and
i
never
once
experienced
in
them
the
slightest
apprehension
of
sudden
superphysical
manifestations
yet
i
cannot
help
saying
that
as
i
met
that
glance
from
the
pseudo-tristram's
eyes
i
felt
my
flesh
begin
to
creep
he
sat
for
so
long
in
silence
that
i
began
to
wonder
if
he
ever
meant
to
speak
the
secret
of
success
in
seeing
certain
classes
of
apparitions
he
said
at
length
to
a
very
great
extent
lies
in
sympathy
sympathy
and
now
for
my
story
i
will
tell
it
to
you
in
the
'third
person'
i
looked
at
tristram's
face
in
dismay
the
third
person
yes
the
third
person
he
gravely
rejoined
and
under
the
circumstances
the
only
person
you
see
it
is
now
close
on
midnight
i
looked
at
the
clock
great
heavens
what
he
said
was
correct
a
whole
evening
had
slipped
by
without
my
knowledge
he
would
of
course
have
to
stay
the
night
i
suggested
it
to
him
my
dear
fellow
he
replied
with
an
odd
smile
don't
worry
about
me
i
am
not
dependent
on
any
trains
i
shall
be
home
by
two
o'clock
i
shivered--a
draught
of
cold
air
had
in
all
probability
stolen
through
the
cracks
of
the
ill-fitting
window-frames
you
have
on
one
of
your
queer
moods
martin
i
expostulated
to
be
home
by
two
o'clock
you
must
fly
but
proceed--at
all
costs
the
story
tristram
raised
an
eyebrow
a
true
sign
that
something
of
special
interest
would
follow
you
know
bruges
he
began
i
nodded
very
well
then
he
went
on
exactly
a
week
ago
martin
tristram
arrived
there
from
antwerp
the
hour
was
late
the
weather
boisterous
tristram
was
tired
and
any
lodging
was
better
than
none
hailing
a
four-wheeler
he
asked
the
jehu
to
drive
him
to
some
decent
hostel
where
the
sheets
were
clean
and
the
tariff
moderate
and
the
fellow
gathering
up
the
reins
took
him
at
a
snail's
pace
to
a
mediã¦val-looking
tavern
in
la
rue
croissante
you
remember
that
street
perhaps
not
it
is
quite
a
back
street
extremely
narrow
very
tortuous
and
miserably
lighted
with
a
few
gas-lamps
of
the
usual
antique
belgian
order
tristram
was
too
tired
however
to
be
fastidious
he
felt
he
could
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
anywhere
and
what
scruples
he
might
have
had
were
entirely
dissipated
by
the
appearance
of
the
charming
girl
who
answered
the
door
it
is
not
expedient
to
dwell
upon
her--she
plays
a
very
minor
part
if
indeed
any
in
the
story
martin
tristram
merely
thought
her
pretty
and
that
as
i
have
said
fully
reconciled
him
to
taking
up
his
quarters
in
the
house
he
has
as
you
are
doubtless
aware
a
weakness
for
vivid
colouring
and
her
bright
yellow
hair
carmine
lips
and
scarlet
stockings
struck
him
impressively
as
she
led
the
way
to
his
bed-chamber
where
she
somewhat
reluctantly
parted
from
him
with
a
subtly
attractive
smile
left
to
himself
martin
sleepily
examined
his
surroundings
the
room
oak-panelled
throughout
was
long
low
and
gloomy
an
enormous
old-fashioned
empty
fireplace
occupied
the
centre
of
one
of
the
walls
on
the
one
side
of
it
was
an
oak
settee
on
the
other
an
equally
ponderous
black
oak
chest
heavy
oaken
beams
traversed
the
ceiling
and
the
sombre
funereal
character
of
the
room
was
further
increased
by
a
colossal
and
antique
four-poster
which
placed
in
the
exact
middle
of
the
chamber
faced
a
gigantic
mirror
attached
to
grotesquely
carved
and
excessively
lofty
sable
supports
viewed
in
the
feeble
fluctuating
candlelight
the
latter
seemed
endowed
with
some
peculiar
and
emphatically
weird
life--their
glistening
polished
surfaces
threw
a
dozen
and
one
fantastic
but
oddly
human
shadows
on
the
boards
as
at
the
same
time
they
appeared
in
bewildering
alternation
to
increase
and
diminish
in
stature
tristram
hastily
undressed
and
stretching
himself
between
the
blankets
prepared
to
go
to
sleep
like
yourself
and
for
a
similar
reason
he
never
sleeps
on
his
left
side
accordingly
he
occupied
the
right
portion
only
of
the
enormous
bed
why
he
did
not
fall
asleep
at
once
he
could
not
explain
he
fancied
that
it
might
be
because
he
was
overtired
this
undoubtedly
had
something
to
do
with
it
as
also
had
the
remarkable
noises--footfalls
creaks
and
sighs--that
came
from
every
corner
of
the
apartment
the
moment
the
light
was
out
he
listened
to
these
inexplicable
sounds
with
increasing
alarm
until
the
sonorous
clock
from
somewhere
outside
boomed
'one'
when
quite
unaccountably
he
fell
asleep
awaking
on
the
stroke
of
two
from
a
dreadful
nightmare
to
his
intense
astonishment
and
consternation
he
was
no
longer
alone
in
the
bed--someone
or
something
was
lying
by
his
side
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
bed
at
first
his
thoughts
reverted
to
the
young
lady
with
the
scarlet
stockings
then
a
sensation
of
icy
coldness
whilst
speedily
reassuring
him
with
regard
to
her
struck
him
with
the
utmost
terror
who
or
what
could
it
be
for
some
seconds
he
lay
in
breathless
silence
too
frightened
even
to
stir
and
panic-stricken
lest
the
violent
beating
of
his
heart
should
arouse
the
mysterious
visitor
but
at
length
impelled
by
an
irresistible
impulse
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
opened
his
eyes
the
room
was
aglow
with
a
phosphorescent
light
and
in
the
depths
of
the
glittering
mirror
he
saw
a
startling
reproduction
of
the
phantasmagoric
four-poster
he
instinctively
felt
that
there
was
some
extraordinary
change
in
the
supports
and
that
the
suspicions
he
had
at
first
entertained
as
to
their
semi-human
properties
had
become
verified
but
mercifully
for
his
sanity
he
found
it
impossible
to
look
his
attention
was
immediately
riveted
on
the
object
by
his
side
which
he
recognized
with
a
thrill
of
surprise
was
a
bronzed
and
bearded
man
of
rather
more
than
middle
age
who
appeared
to
be
buried
in
the
most
profound
sleep
the
picture
was
so
vividly
portrayed
in
the
glass
that
tristram
could
see
the
gentle
heaving
of
the
bedclothes
each
time
the
sleeper
breathed
fascinated
beyond
measure
at
such
an
unlooked-for
spectacle
and
desirous
of
a
closer
inspection
tristram
with
a
supreme
effort
managed
to
tear
away
his
eyes
from
the
mirror
and
to
glance
at
the
bed
where
to
his
unmitigated
astonishment
he
saw
no
one
quite
unable
to
know
what
to
make
of
the
phenomenon
he
again
directed
his
gaze
to
the
glass
and
there
right
enough
lay
the
sleeper
a
cold
shudder
now
ran
through
tristram--he
could
no
longer
disguise
from
himself
what
he
had
in
reality
thought
all
along
that
the
room
was
haunted
the
usual
symptoms
accompanying
occult
manifestations
rapidly
made
themselves
known
tristram
was
constrained
to
stare
at
the
luminous
glitter
before
him
in
helpless
expectation
to
save
his
soul
he
could
neither
have
stirred
nor
uttered
the
faintest
ejaculation
he
saw
in
the
mirror
the
door
of
the
bedroom
slowly
open
and
a
hideous
apish
face
peep
stealthily
in
not
at
him
but
at
the
sleeper
next
he
watched
a
figure
brown
hairy
and
lurid--the
figure
of
some
huge
monkey--come
crawling
into
the
room
on
all-fours
and
followed
each
of
its
tell-tale
movements
as
sidling
up
to
its
sleeping
victim
it
suddenly
hurled
itself
at
him
choking
him
to
death
with
its
long
fingers
this
was
the
climax--tristram
saw
no
more
the
phosphorescent
light
died
out
the
mirror
darkened
and
on
sinking
back
on
his
pillow
he
realized
with
the
wildest
delight
he
was
once
again
alone--his
bedfellow
had
gone
tristram
was
so
unnerved
by
all
that
had
happened
that
he
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
the
house
at
daybreak
a
decision
which
however
was
altered
on
the
appearance
of
the
sun
and
the
charming
little
girl
in
the
red
stockings
after
breakfasting
tristram
strolled
about
the
town
chancing
to
meet
an
old
school-fellow
named
heriot
in
the
rue
de
mermadotte
heriot
had
only
recently
come
to
bruges
he
was
dissatisfied
with
his
lodgings
and
readily
fell
in
with
tristram's
suggestion
that
they
should
'dig'
together
the
maid
with
the
yellow
hair
was
more
pleasing
than
ever
heriot
fell
desperately
in
love
with
her
and
it
was
close
on
midnight
before
he
could
be
persuaded
to
bid
her
good
night
and
accompany
tristram
to
the
bed-chamber
'i
wonder
why
she
told
me
not
to
sleep
on
the
left
side
of
the
bed'
he
said
to
martin
as
they
began
to
undress
tristram
glanced
guiltily
at
the
mirror
for
reasons
of
his
own
he
hadn't
as
much
as
hinted
to
heriot
what
he
had
seen
there
the
previous
night
and
he
was
not
at
all
sure
now
that
it
might
not
have
been
a
nightmare
or
an
hallucination
anyhow
he
would
like
to
put
it
to
the
test
before
mentioning
it
to
anyone
and
heriot
whom
he
knew
to
be
a
sceptic
with
regard
to
ghosts
was
so
strong
and
hale
a
man
physically
that
happen
what
might
he
had
no
apprehensions
whatever
concerning
him
regretting
that
he
was
obliged
to
disobey
the
wishes
of
a
lady
heriot
declared
his
preference
for
the
left
side
of
the
bed
adding
that
if
the
maiden
was
so
highly
enamoured
of
him
she
must
put
herself
to
the
inconvenience
of
a
few
extra
yards
'infatuation
like
hers'
he
maintained
'should
surely
overcome
all
obstacles'
nothing
loth
tristram
gave
in
to
him
and
before
many
minutes
had
elapsed
both
men
had
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep
on
the
stroke
of
two
tristram
awoke
perspiring
horribly
the
room
was
once
again
aglow
with
a
phosphorescent
light
and
he
felt
the
presence
next
to
him
of
something
cold
and
clammy
unable
to
look
elsewhere
he
was
again
compelled
to
gaze
in
the
mirror
where
he
saw
to
his
consternation
and
horror
no
heriot
but
in
his
place
the
man
with
the
bronzed
face
and
bushy
beard
he
had
hardly
recovered
from
the
shock
occasioned
by
this
discovery
when
the
door
surreptitiously
opened
and
the
figure
of
the
ape
glided
noiselessly
in
again
he
was
temporarily
paralysed
his
limbs
losing
all
their
power
of
action
and
his
tongue
cleaving
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
the
movements
of
the
phantasm
were
entirely
repetitionary
of
the
previous
night
approaching
the
bed
on
'all-fours'
it
leapt
on
its
victim
the
tragedy
being
accompanied
this
time
by
the
most
realistic
chokings
and
gurgles
to
all
of
which
tristram
was
obliged
to
listen
in
an
agony
of
doubt
and
terror
the
drama
ended
tristram
was
overcome
by
a
sudden
fit
of
drowsiness
and
sinking
back
on
to
his
pillow
slept
till
broad
daylight
anxious
to
question
heriot
as
to
whether
he
too
had
been
a
witness
of
the
ghostly
transaction
he
touched
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
there
was
no
reply
he
touched
him
again
and
still
no
answer
he
touched
him
yet
a
third
time
and
as
there
was
still
no
response
he
leaned
over
his
shoulder
and
peered
into
his
face
heriot
was
dead





'this
is
the
fourth
death
in
that
bed
within
the
last
twelve
months
that
i
can
swear
to'
the
english
doctor
remarked
to
tristram
as
they
walked
down
the
street
together
'and
always
from
the
same
cause
failure
of
the
heart
due
to
a
sudden
shock
if
you
take
my
advice
you'll
clear
out
of
the
place
at
once'
tristram
thought
so
too
but
before
he
went
he
had
a
talk
with
the
girl
in
the
red
stockings
'i
can't
tell
you
all
i
know'
she
said
to
him
as
he
kissed
her
'but
i
wouldn't
sleep
a
night
in
that
room
for
a
fortune
though
i
believe
it's
quite
safe
if
you
keep
on
the
right
side
of
the
bed
i
wish
your
friend
had
done
so
he
was
so
handsome'
and
tristram
not
a
little
hurt
let
go
her
hand
and
made
arrangements
for
the
funeral





and
is
that
all
i
asked
as
tristram's
material
body
paused
it
may
be
was
the
reply
but
that
is
why
i've
come
to
you
don't
be
gulled
by
tristram
into
any
investigations
in
that
house
enthusiasm
for
his
research
work
makes
him
unconsciously
callous
and
if
he
once
got
you
there
he
might
even
against
your
better
judgment
persuade
you
to
sleep
on
the
left
side
good
night
i
shook
hands
with
him
and
he
departed
the
following
evening
i
heard
it
all
again
from
tristram
himself--the
real
tristram
needless
to
say
his
concluding
remarks
differed
essentially
with
unbounded
cordiality
he
urged
me
to
accompany
him
back
again
to
bruges
and
i--declined





he
wrote
to
me
afterwards
to
say
that
he
had
discovered
the
history
of
the
house--a
man
a
music-hall
artist
answering
to
the
description
of
the
figure
in
the
bed--had
once
lived
there
with
a
performing
ape
an
orang-outang
and
happening
to
annoy
the
animal
one
day
the
latter
had
killed
him
the
brute
was
eventually
shot
this
experience
of
mine
tristram
added
is
of
the
greatest
value
for
it
has
thoroughly
convinced
me
of
one
thing
at
least--and
that--that
apes
have
spirits
and
if
that
be
so
so
must
all
other
kinds
of
animals
of
course
they
must
phantasms
of
cat
and
baboon
a
sister
of
a
well-known
author
tells
me
there
used
to
be
a
house
called
the
swallows
standing
in
two
acres
of
land
close
to
a
village
near
basingstoke
in
1840
a
mr
bishop
of
tring
bought
the
house
which
had
long
stood
empty
and
went
to
live
there
in
1841
after
being
there
a
fortnight
two
servants
gave
notice
to
leave
stating
that
the
place
was
haunted
by
a
large
cat
and
a
big
baboon
which
they
constantly
saw
stealing
down
the
staircases
and
passages
they
also
testified
to
hearing
sounds
as
of
somebody
being
strangled
proceeding
from
an
empty
attic
near
where
they
slept
and
of
the
screams
and
groans
of
a
number
of
people
being
horribly
tortured
in
the
cellars
just
underneath
the
dairy
on
going
to
see
what
was
the
cause
of
the
disturbances
nothing
was
ever
visible
by
and
by
other
members
of
the
household
began
to
be
harassed
by
similar
manifestations
the
news
spread
through
the
village
and
crowds
of
people
came
to
the
house
with
lights
and
sticks
to
see
if
they
could
witness
anything
one
night
at
about
twelve
o'clock
when
several
of
the
watchers
were
stationed
on
guard
in
the
empty
courtyard
they
all
saw
the
forms
of
a
huge
cat
and
a
baboon
rise
from
the
closed
grating
of
the
large
cellar
under
the
old
dairy
rush
past
them
and
disappear
in
a
dark
angle
of
the
walls
the
same
figures
were
repeatedly
seen
afterwards
by
many
other
persons
early
in
december
1841
mr
bishop
hearing
fearful
screams
accompanied
by
deep
and
hoarse
jabberings
apparently
coming
from
the
top
of
the
house
rushed
upstairs
whereupon
all
was
instantly
silent
and
he
could
discover
nothing
after
that
mr
bishop
set
to
work
to
get
rid
of
the
house
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
as
a
purchaser
a
retired
colonel
who
was
soon
however
scared
out
of
it
this
was
in
1842
it
was
soon
after
pulled
down
the
ground
was
used
for
the
erection
of
cottages
but
the
hauntings
being
transferred
to
them
they
were
speedily
vacated
and
no
one
ever
daring
to
inhabit
them
they
were
eventually
demolished
the
site
on
which
they
stood
being
converted
into
allotments
there
were
many
theories
as
to
the
history
of
the
swallows
one
being
that
a
highwayman
known
as
steeplechase
jock
the
son
of
a
scottish
chieftain
had
once
plied
his
trade
there
and
murdered
many
people
whose
bodies
were
supposed
to
be
buried
somewhere
on
or
near
the
premises
he
was
said
to
have
had
a
terrible
though
decidedly
unorthodox
ending--falling
into
a
vat
of
boiling
tar
a
raving
madman
but
what
were
the
phantasms
of
the
ape
and
cat
were
they
the
earth-bound
spirits
of
the
highwayman
and
his
horse
or
simply
the
spirits
of
two
animals
though
either
theory
is
possible
i
am
inclined
to
favour
the
former
psychic
bears
edmund
lenthal
swifte
appointed
in
1814
keeper
of
the
crown
jewels
in
the
tower
of
london
refers
in
an
article
in
notes
and
queries
1860
to
various
unaccountable
phenomena
happening
in
the
tower
during
his
residence
there
he
says
that
one
night
in
the
jewel
office
one
of
the
sentries
was
alarmed
by
a
figure
like
a
huge
bear
issuing
from
underneath
the
jewel
room
door
he
thrust
at
it
with
his
bayonet
which
going
right
through
it
stuck
in
the
doorway
whereupon
he
dropped
in
a
fit
and
was
carried
senseless
to
the
guard-room
when
on
the
morrow
mr
swifte
saw
the
soldier
in
the
guard-room
his
fellow-sentinel
was
also
there
and
the
latter
testified
to
having
seen
his
comrade
before
the
alarm
quiet
and
active
and
in
full
possession
of
his
faculties
he
was
now
so
mr
swifte
added
changed
almost
beyond
recognition
and
died
the
following
day
mr
george
offer
in
referring
to
this
incident
alludes
to
queer
noises
having
been
heard
at
the
time
the
figure
appeared
presuming
that
the
sentinel
was
not
the
victim
of
an
hallucination
the
question
arises
as
to
the
kind
of
spirit
that
he
saw
the
bear
judging
by
cases
that
have
been
told
me
is
by
no
means
an
uncommon
occult
phenomenon
the
difficulty
is
how
to
classify
it
since
upon
no
question
appertaining
to
the
psychic
can
one
dogmatize
to
quote
from
a
clever
poem
that
appeared
in
the
january
number
of
the
occult
review
to
pretend
one
knows
anything
definite
about
the
immaterial
world
is
all
swank
at
the
most
we--parsons
priests
theosophists
christian
scientists
psychical
research
professors--at
the
most
can
only
speculate
nothing--nothing
whatsoever
beyond
the
bare
fact
that
there
are
phenomena
unaccountable
by
physical
laws
has
as
yet
been
discovered
all
the
time
and
energy
and
space
that
have
been
devoted
by
scientists
to
the
investigation
of
spiritualism
and
to
making
tests
in
automatic
writing
are
in
my
opinion--and
i
believe
i
speak
for
the
man
in
the
street--hopelessly
futile
no
one
who
has
ever
really
experienced
spontaneous
ghostly
manifestations
could
for
one
moment
believe
in
the
genuineness
of
the
phenomena
produced
at
sã©ances
they
have
never
deceived
me
and
i
am
of
the
opinion
spirits
cannot
be
convoked
to
order
either
through
a
so-called
medium
falling
into
a
so-called
trance
through
table-turning
automatic
writing
or
anything
else
if
a
spirit
comes
it
will
come
either
voluntarily
or
in
obedience
to
some
unknown
power--and
certainly
neither
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
a
crowd
of
sensation-loving
men
and
women
nor
to
be
analysed
by
some
cold
calculating
presumptuous
professor
of
physics
whose
proper
sphere
is
the
laboratory
but
to
proceed
the
phenomenon
of
the
big
bear
provided
again
it
was
really
objective
may
have
been
the
phantasm
of
some
prehistoric
creature
whose
bones
lie
interred
beneath
the
tower
for
we
know
the
valley
of
the
thames
was
infested
with
giant
reptiles
and
quadrupeds
of
all
kinds
i
incline
to
this
theory
or
it
may
have
been
a
vice-elemental
or--the
phantasm
of
a
human
being
who
lived
a
purely
animal
life
and
whose
spirit
would
naturally
take
the
form
most
closely
resembling
it





judging
by
the
number
of
experiences
related
to
me
hauntings
by
phantom
hares
and
rabbits
would
appear
to
be
far
from
uncommon
there
is
this
difference
however
between
the
hauntings
by
the
two
species
of
animal--phantom
hares
usually
portend
death
or
some
grave
catastrophe
either
to
the
witness
himself
or
to
someone
immediately
associated
with
him
whereas
phantom
rabbits
are
seldom
prophetic
and
may
generally
be
looked
upon
merely
as
the
earth-bound
spirits
of
some
poor
rabbits
that
have
met
with
untimely
ends
hauntings
by
a
white
rabbit
mr
wt
stead
in
his
real
ghost
stories
gives
an
account
of
the
hauntings
by
a
phantom
rabbit
in
a
house
in
----
road
he
does
not
however
mention
any
locality
after
describing
several
of
the
phenomena
which
disturbed
various
occupants
of
the
place
he
goes
on
to
say
in
the
language
of
mrs
a
who
narrates
the
incident--
a
dog
which
lay
on
the
rug
also
heard
the
sounds
for
he
pricked
up
his
ears
and
barked
without
a
moment's
delay
she
flew
to
the
door
calling
the
dog
to
follow
her
intending
as
she
did
so
to
open
the
hall
door
and
call
for
assistance
but
the
dog
though
an
excellent
house
dog
crouched
at
her
feet
and
whined
but
would
not
follow
her
up
the
stairs
so
she
carried
him
up
in
her
arms
and
reaching
the
door
called
for
assistance
when
however
the
dining-room
doors
were
opened
the
rooms
were
in
perfect
quiet
and
destitute
of
any
signs
of
life
the
behaviour
of
the
dog
here
accords
exactly
with
the
behaviour
of
dogs
i
have
had
in
haunted
houses
and
substantiates
my
theory
that
dogs
are
excellent
psychic
barometers
after
the
family
had
been
in
the
house
a
few
weeks
a
white
rabbit
made
its
appearance
this
uncanny
animal
would
suddenly
appear
in
a
room
in
which
members
of
the
family
were
seated
and
after
gliding
round
and
slipping
under
chairs
and
tables
would
disappear
through
a
brick
wall
as
easily
as
through
an
open
door
this
is
the
invariable
trick
of
ghosts
they
seldom
however
open
doors
mrs
a
adds--
some
years
have
now
elapsed
since
the
incident
i
have
now
related
took
place
and
again
in
response
to
orders
given
by
the
enterprising
landlord
of
the
property
long-closed
doors
and
windows
have
been
thrown
open
and
painters
and
paperhangers
have
brought
their
skill
to
bear
upon
gruesome
rooms
and
halls
the
house
is
once
more
inhabited
this
time
by
a
widow
lady
and
some
grown-up
sons
these
tenants
come
from
a
distance
and
are
entirely
strangers
both
to
the
neighbourhood
and
the
former
history
of
the
house
but
to
use
her
own
words
the
mistress
'cannot
understand
what
ails
the
house'
her
sons
insist
on
sleeping
together
in
one
room
and
the
quiet
of
the
house
is
constantly
being
broken
by
the
erratic
appearances
of
a
large
white
rabbit
which
the
inmates
are
frequently
engaged
chasing
but
are
never
able
to
find
mr
stead
offers
no
explanation
i
can
see
no
other
conclusion
however
than
that
this
ghost
was
the
actual
phantasm
of
some
rabbit
that
had
been
done
to
death
in
the
house
probably
by
the
boy
whose
apparition
was
among
the
other
manifestations
seen
there
john
wesley's
ghost
in

article
more
glimpses
of
the
unseen
occult
review
october
1906
mr
reginald
b
span
writes--
during
the
extraordinary
manifestations
which
occurred
in
the
house
of
john
wesley
at
epworth
the
phantom
forms
of
two
animals
appeared
one
being
a
large
white
rabbit
and
the
other
an
animal
like
a
badger
which
used
to
appear
in
the
bedrooms
and
run
about
and
then
disappear
whilst
the
various
bangings
and
rappings
were
at
their
loudest
this
is
the
only
case
i
have
ever
come
across
of
the
ghost
of
a
badger
i
think
it
must
be
unique
mr
span
adds
many
strange
and
inexplicable
things
occurred
in
that
house
which
were
not
due
to
any
natural
cause
or
reason
i
remember
that
loud
rappings
used
to
sound
round
my
room
at
nights
even
when
i
had
a
light
burning
i
was
often
awakened
by
rappings
on
the
floor
of
my
bedroom
which
would
then
sound
on
the
walls
and
furniture
and
were
heard
by
others
occupying
rooms
some
distance
off
this
again
is
most
interesting
as
ghosts
seldom
visit
lighted
rooms
mr
span
continues--
it
was
in
the
afternoon
in
broad
daylight
when
my
brother
saw
this
mysterious
animal
he
was
in
the
drawing-room
alone
and
as
he
was
standing
at
one
side
of
the
room
looking
at
a
picture
on
the
walls
he
heard
a
noise
behind
him
and
found
on
looking
round
that
a
sofa
which
generally
lay
against
one
of
the
walls
had
been
lifted
by
some
unknown
power
into
the
middle
of
the
room
at
the
same
time
he
saw
an
animal
like
a
rabbit
run
from
under
the
sofa
across
the
room
and
disappear
into
the
wall
he
searched
everywhere
for
the
animal
which
could
not
have
escaped
from
the
room
as
the
doors
and
window
were
closed
but
was
unable
to
find
any
sign
of
one
or
any
hole
whereby
one
might
have
passed
out
the
psychic
faculty
in
hares
and
rabbits
hares
and
rabbits
are
very
susceptible
to
the
superphysical
the
presence
of
which
they
scent
in
the
same
manner
as
do
horses
and
dogs
i
have
known
them
to
evince
the
greatest
symptoms
of
terror
when
brought
into
a
haunted
house
inhabitants
of
the
jungle
elephants
lions
tigers
etc
elephants
undoubtedly
possess
the
faculty
of
scenting
spirits
in
a
very
marked
degree
it
is
most
difficult
to
get
an
elephant
to
pass
a
spot
where
any
phantasm
is
known
to
appear
the
big
beast
at
once
comes
to
a
halt
trembles
trumpets
and
turning
round
can
only
be
urged
forward
by
the
gentlest
coaxing
jungles
are
full
of
the
ghosts
of
slain
men
and
animals
and
afford
more
variety
in
hauntings
than
any
other
localities
the
spirits
of
such
cruel
creatures
as
lions
tigers
leopards
are
very
much
earth-bound
and
may
be
seen
or
heard
night
after
night
haunting
the
sites
of
their
former
depredations
the
following
case
of
a
tiger
ghost
was
narrated
to
me
years
ago
by
a
gentleman
whom
i
will
style
mr
de
silva
pwd
i
published
his
account
in
a
popular
weekly
journal
as
follows--
the
white
tiger
tap
tap
tap
someone
was
coming
behind
me
i
halted
and
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
saw
a
figure
hobbling
along--first
one
thin
leg
then
the
other
always
with
the
same
measured
stride--accompanied
with
the
same
tapping
of
the
stick
i
had
no
wish
for
his
company
though
the
road
was
lonely
and
i
feared
the
presence
of
tigers
so
i
hurried
on
and
the
faster
i
went
the
nearer
he
seemed
to
come
tap
tap
tap
the
man
was
blind
and
a
leper
and
so
repulsively
ugly
that
the
niggers
on
the
settlement
regarded
him
with
superstitious
awe
i
had
a
horror
of
tigers
but
of
lepers
even
greater
and
i
loved
my
wife
with
no
ordinary
love
so
i
hurried
on
and
he
followed
quickly
after
me
the
night
was
brilliant
even
more
so
i
thought
than
was
ordinary
and
the
very
brilliancy
made
me
fear
for
my
shadow
the
shadow
of
the
trees
shadows
for
which
i
had
no
name
flickered
across
the
road
were
lost
to
sight
to
return
again
and
the
jungle
was
getting
nearer
the
open
country
on
either
side
ceased
one
by
one
tall
blades
of
jungle
grass
shook
their
heads
in
the
gentle
breeze
and
the
silence
of
the
darkness
beyond
began
to
make
itself
felt
a
night
bird
whizzed
past
me
croaking
out
a
dismal
incantation
from
its
black
throat
something
at
which
i
did
not
care
to
look
clattered
from
under
a
stone
i
loosened
with
my
foot
and
sped
into
the
shade
and
i
hastened
on
tap
tap
tap
faster
and
faster
and
faster
came
the
blind
man
i
could
smell
the
oil
on
his
body
hear
his
breathing
'whoever
you
are
sahib
stop'
there
was
fear
in
his
voice
as
he
whined
out
these
words
a
fear
which
increased
my
own
but
i
pretended
not
to
hear
and
pressed
on
faster
the
darkness
grew
high
over
my
head
at
either
side
of
the
road
waved
the
grass
rustling
to
and
fro
and
singing
to
sleep
the
insects
nestling
on
its
green
stalks
with
its
old-time
song
of
the
jungle
the
grass
ahead
of
me
slowly
parted
my
heart
beat
quicker
the
tapping
behind
me
ceased--it
was
only
some
small
animal
what
was
it
a
small
hyaena
no
a
jackal
a
lame
jackal
and
it
looked
at
me
from
out
of
eyes
that
for
some
reason
or
other
made
me
shiver
i
did
not
know
what
there
was
about
the
jackal
that
was
different
from
what
i
had
seen
in
any
other
jackal
but
there
was
a
something
and
as
i
looked
at
it
in
awe
it
vanished--melted
into
thin
air
the
moment
after
a
second
jackal
appeared
just
where
the
other
one
had
been
standing
but
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
this
one
and
on
my
bending
down
pretending
to
look
for
a
stone
to
throw
at
it
it
slunk
back
silently
and
stealthily
whence
it
had
come
and
i
hurried
on
faster
than
ever
knowing
a
tiger
was
near
at
hand
tap
tap
tap
i
blessed
the
presence
of
the
blind
man
'for
god's
sake
sahib
stop
for
the
love
of
allah
sahib
stop'
you
know
how
they
talk
o'donnell
'the
jackals
did
you
see
them
i
knew
them
by
their
smell
the
smell
of
the
living
and
of
the
dead
walk
with
me
sahib
for
allah's
sake'
presently
o'donnell
i
heard
a
heavier
rustling
in
the
grass
than
the
wind
makes
a
rustling
that
kept
pace
with
me
and
went
along
by
my
side
never
halting
but
faster
and
faster
and
faster
a
short
distance
ahead
of
me
was
a
patch
of
bright
light
where
the
cross-roads
met
a
few
yards
more
and
the
jungle
grass
would
end
i
thought
of
this
o'donnell--the
beggar
might
not
know
the
road
so
well
as
i
he
had
no
wife
no
child
he
was
a
leper
only
a
leper--and
my
teeth
chattered
here
the
colonel
paused
and
wiped
his
forehead
i
slackened
my
speed
the
rustling
by
my
side
slowing
down
and
the
tapping
grew
faster
i
was
close
to
the
whitened
road
'sahib
the
blessing
of
allah
be
on
you
for
stopping
sahib
let
me
walk
by
your
side'
to
the
end
of
my
days
o'donnell
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
and
yet
i
want
you
to
understand
it
was
for
my
wife--and
child
i
slunk
into
the
shade
two
steps
more
and
the
tapping
would
pass
me
the
stick
struck
the
ground
within
one
inch
of
my
foot
my
heart
almost
ceased
to
beat
i
gazed
in
fascination
at
the
spot
in
the
jungle
opposite
the
heavy
rustling
had
stopped
only
the
gentle
sighing
of
the
wind
went
on
the
two
steps
were
taken
the
blind
man
paused
on
the
cross-roads
he
was
ghastly
in
the
moonlight
i
shuddered
his
eyes
peered
enquiringly
round
on
all
sides
he
was
looking
for
me
he
had
lost
his
way
he
feared
the
tiger
suddenly
something
huge
shot
like
an
arrow
from
the
darkness
opposite
me
i
bowed
my
head
o'donnell
and
muttered
a
prayer
for
i
thought
my
end
had
come
a
terrible
scream
rang
out
in
the
clear
night
air
i
was
saved
'allah
curse
you
and
yours
sahib'
i
opened
my
eyes
an
enormous
tiger
was
bending
over
the
leper
searching
for
the
most
convenient
spot
in
his
body
to
afford
a
tight
grip
the
man's
sightless
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
moon
his
teeth
shone
white
and
even
with
the
striped
horror
purring
in
his
face
he
thought
of
vengeance
on
me
i
dared
not
move
i
could
not
pass
o'donnell
i
had
no
gun
the
big
brute
found
a
nice
place
to
catch
hold
it
opened
its
mouth
so
that
i
could
see
its
glistening
teeth
it
looked
down
at
its
paws
where
the
cruel
claws
glittered
and
they
seemed
to
afford
it
keen
satisfaction--it
was
a
tigress
and
vain--then
it
lowered
its
head
and
the
leper
shrieked
i
watched
it
pick
him
up
as
if
he
were
one
of
its
cubs
saw
the
blood
trickle
down
its
soft
white
throat
into
the
dusty
road
and
then
it
trotted
gracefully
away
and
was
lost
in
the
darkness
of
the
jungle
there
was
a
deathlike
silence
after
this
i
waited
a
few
minutes
and
then
i
got
up
i
had
only
a
short
distance
to
go
and
i
no
longer
feared
the
presence
of
man-eaters--there
was
not
likely
to
be
another
hours
afterwards
o'donnell
when
i
lay
in
my
hammock
as
safe
as
a
fortress
i
fancied
i
heard
the
dead
man's
cry
fancied
i
heard
his
curse
no
one
was
more
devoted
to
a
wife
than
i
was
to
mine
ours
had
been
purely
a
love
match
and
it
was
against
my
wish
that
she
had
accompanied
me
to
such
an
out-of-the-way
place
as
seconee
i
told
her
about
my
adventure
suppressing
the
leper's
curse
and
i
was
glad
i
did
so
as
she
was
greatly
distressed
'thank
goodness
you
escaped
charlie'
she
said
'i
am
so
sorry
for
the
poor
leper
i
suppose
you
couldn't
have
helped
him'
'i
might
have
fetched
my
rifle'
i
replied
'and
tried
to
rescue
him
of
course
but
i
fear
it
wouldn't
have
been
of
much
avail
as
he
would
have
been
badly
mauled
by
then'
my
wife
sighed
'ah
well'
she
said
'love
is
selfish
it
makes
one
forget
others
still
i
wouldn't
have
it
otherwise'
'i
wish
this
railway
job
here
was
over'
i
murmured
sitting
with
my
elbows
on
my
knees
and
looking
over
the
flat
ground
sun-baked
and
barren
away
towards
the
dark
jungles
and
the
still
darker
mountains
towering
above
them
and
as
i
gazed
a
shadow
seemed
to
blur
my
vision
and
a
voice
to
whisper
in
my
ears
'beware
of
my
curse'
i
took
cushai
one
of
the
native
servants
into
confidence
'now
cushai'
i
said
'you
know
all
the
superstitions
of
the
country--the
evil
eye
and
the
rest
of
them
tell
me
what
can
the
dying
curse
of
a
leper
do'
cushai
turned
pale
under
his
skin
'not
of
nahra'
he
stuttered
swinging
the
knife
with
which
he
had
been
cutting
maize
in
his
hand
'not
of
nahra
the
leper
of
futtebah
sahib
if
you
were
cursed
by
him
beware
he
was
learned
in
the
black
arts
he
could
heal
ulcers
by
repeating
a
prayer
he
could
bring
on
fever'
at
this
o'donnell
i
turned
cold
i
had
lived
long
in
india
i
had
seen
their
so-called
juggling
had
experienced
also
strange
cases
of
telepathy
and
knew
quite
sufficient
of
their
intimacy
with
the
supernatural
elements
to
be
afraid
'you
must
keep
the
young
sahib
safe'
cushai
said
'and
the
white
lady
i
wish
it
hadn't
been
nahra'
i
took
his
advice
my
boy
eric
was
more
closely
supervised
than
ever
and
as
to
my
wife
i
begged
and
entreated
her
not
to
move
from
the
house
until
the
tiger
was
dead
and
i
searched
for
it
everywhere
the
dry
season
passed
the
wet
came
and
my
work
still
kept
me
in
seconee
at
times
there
came
to
us
rumours
of
the
man-eater--of
another
victim--but
it
never
visited
our
bungalow
where
the
bright
rifle
leaned
against
the
wall
waiting
for
it
i
certainly
did
meet
with
slight
misfortunes
which
the
more
timid
might
have
put
down
to
the
working
of
the
curse
my
little
finger
was
squashed
in
the
laying
down
of
a
rail
and
eric
had
several
bouts
of
sickness
it
was
nearly
a
year
after
the
leper's
death
that
alarming
rumours
of
a
man-eater
having
been
at
work
again
were
spread
about
us
several
niggers
were
carried
off
or
badly
bitten
and
the
wounded
showed
symptoms
of
the
loathsome
disease
so
well
known
and
feared
by
us
all--leprosy
i
knew
from
that
it
must
be
the
same
tiger
'the
tiger
is
near'
someone
would
cry
out
and
a
stampede
among
the
native
workmen
would
ensue
'why
the
white
tiger'
i
asked
cushai
'because
sahib'
he
replied
'the
leprosy
has
made
it
so
tigers
like
men
and
all
other
animals
go
white
even
to
their
hair
i
have
not
told
them
the
story
sahib
they
only
know
it
must
have
caught
the
leprosy
to
them
nahra
is
still
living'
then
o'donnell
when
i
thought
of
what
was
at
stake
and
of
all
the
hideous
possibilities
the
presence
of
this
brute
created
i
took
my
rifle
and
went
out
to
search
for
it
in
the
evenings
when
the
dark
clouds
from
the
mountains
descended
and
the
wind
hissed
through
the
jungle
grass
i
plodded
along
with
no
other
companion
than
my
winchester
repeater--searching
always
searching
for
the
damned
tiger
i
found
it
o'donnell
came
upon
it
just
as
it
was
in
the
midst
of
a
meal--dining
off
a
native--and
i
shot
it
twice
before
it
recovered
from
its
astonishment
at
seeing
me
the
second
shot
took
effect--i
can
swear
to
that
for
i
took
particular
note
of
the
red
splash
of
blood
on
its
forehead
where
the
bullet
entered
and
i
went
right
up
to
it
to
make
sure
as
god
is
above
us
no
animal
was
more
dead
'the
curse
won't
come
now
cushai'
i
said
laughing
'i've
killed
the
white
tiger'
'killed
the
white
tiger
sahib
allah
bless
you
for
that'
cushai
replied
'but
don't
laugh
too
soon
nahra
was
a
clever
man
wonderfully
clever
he
did
not
speak
empty
words'
and
as
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
dark
hills
again
i
fancied
a
shadow
darted
along
the
sky
and
the
curse
came
back
to
my
ears
i
was
superintending
the
line
one
afternoon
the
backs
of
the
niggers
were
bending
double
under
the
burden
of
the
great
iron
rods
when
i
heard
a
terrible
cry
'the
white
tiger
the
white
tiger'
rods
fell
with
a
crash
spades
followed
suit
a
chorus
of
shrieks
filled
the
air
and
legs
scampered
off
in
all
directions
i
was
fifty
yards
from
my
rifle
and
a
huge
creature
was
slowly
approaching
between
it
and
me
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes--the
white
tiger
the
tiger
i
knew
i
had
killed
here
it
was
here
before
me
the
same
in
every
detail
and
yet
in
some
strange
indefinable
manner
not
the
same
on
it
came
a
huge
patch
of
luminous
white
noiselessly
stealthily--the
mark
of
the
bullet
plainly
visible
on
its
big
flat
forehead
step
by
step
it
approached
me
its
paws
no
longer
with
the
colouring
of
health
but
dull
and
worn
and
as
it
came
the
cold
shadow
of
desolation
seemed
to
fall
around
it
nothing
stirred
there
was
no
noise
whatever
not
even
the
sound
of
its
feet
crushing
the
loosened
soil
on
on
on
nearer
nearer
and
nearer
shunned
by
all
avoided
by
its
fellow-creatures
of
the
jungle
a
blight
to
all
and
everything
it
drew
in
a
line
with
me
not
once
did
its
eyes
meet
mine
o'donnell
not
once
did
it
glare
at
the
natives
who
were
hiding
on
the
banks
of
the
cutting
but
it
stole
silently
on
its
way
with
a
something
in
its
movements
that
left
no
doubt
but
that
it
was
engaged
in
no
casual
venture
i
remembered
o'donnell
that
my
wife
had
promised
to
come
with
eric
to
meet
me
along
the
cutting
as
she
was
sure
no
tiger
would
be
there
i
ran
as
fast
as
i
could
and
yet
somehow
my
feet
seemed
weighted
down
i
cursed
my
folly
for
not
forbidding
my
wife
to
come
it
was
uphill
till
i
got
to
the
bend
and
it
might
have
been
a
mountain
it
seemed
so
steep
i
knew
if
the
thing
i
had
seen
met
them
a
little
farther
on
they
would
be
cornered
as
the
cutting
narrowed
very
much
leaving
not
more
than
twenty
yards
and
that
was
a
generous
estimate
at
last
after
what
seemed
an
eternity
i
reached
the
summit
of
the
slope
the
tiger
was
a
mere
speck
along
the
line
i
rushed
after
it
as
fast
as
i
could
go
stumbling
half
falling
pulling
myself
together
and
tearing
on
and
the
faster
i
went
the
quicker
moved
the
great
white
figure
a
feeling
of
despair
seized
me
all
my
fondness
for
my
wife
became
intensified
tenfold
and
was
revealed
to
me
then
in
its
true
nature
she
was
the
one
great
tie
that
made
life
dear
to
me
even
my
love
for
eric
paled
away
before
the
blinding
affection
i
bore
her
i
tore
madly
on
shouting
at
the
same
time
anything
to
make
the
white
tiger
aware
of
my
presence
to
keep
it
from
seeing
her
another
bend
in
the
road
hid
it
from
view
the
same
hideous
fears
gripped
me
hard
and
fast
as
i
strained
every
muscle
in
the
mad
pursuit
at
last
i
ran
round
the
curve
and
saw
before
me
the
tableau
i
had
dreaded
the
tiger
was
crouching
ready
to
spring
on
the
group
of
three--eva
eric
and
the
ayah
they
were
paralysed
with
fear
and
stood
on
the
rails
staring
at
it
unable
to
move
or
utter
a
sound
i
well
understood
their
feelings
and
knew
they
were
labouring
in
their
minds
as
to
whether
the
thing
that
confronted
them
was
a
creature
of
flesh
and
blood
or
what
it
was
they
could
not
take
their
eyes
off
it
and
as
a
consequence
did
not
see
me
the
white
tiger
now
went
through
a
series
of
actions
so
lifelike
that
i
could
not
but
believe
it
was
real
and
that
i
had
been
deceived
in
thinking
i
had
killed
it
its
haunches
quivered
it
got
ready
to
spring
and
my
rifle
flew
to
my
shoulder
i
saw
it
mark
eric
and
read
the
increased
agony
in
my
wife's
eyes
the
critical
moment
came
another
second
and
the
thing
be
it
material
or
supernatural
would
jump
i
must
fire
at
all
costs
if
mortal
i
must
kill
it
if
ghostly
the
noise
of
my
rifle
might
dematerialize
it
and
as
god
is
my
judge
o'donnell
at
that
moment
i
had
not
the
least
idea
which
of
it
was--tiger
or
phantom
it
sprang--my
brain
reeled--my
fingers
grew
numb
and
as
my
wife
suddenly
bounded
forward
the
shadowy
form
of
nahra
seemed
to
rise
from
the
ground
and
mock
me
with
a
supreme
effort
i
jerked
my
finger
back
and
fired
bang
the
sound
of
the
explosion
acted
like
a
safety-valve
to
the
pent-up
feelings
of
all
and
there
was
a
chorus
of
shrieks
i
rushed
forward--the
ayah
lay
on
the
ground
face
downward
and
motionless
my
wife
had
hold
of
eric
who
was
shaking
all
over
of
the
tiger
there
were
no
signs
it
had
completely
vanished
'thank
god'
i
exclaimed
kissing
my
wife
feverishly
'thank
god
it
was
only
a
ghost
but
it
was
very
alarming
wasn't
it'
'alarming'
my
wife
gasped
'it
was
awful
i
quite
thought
it
was
real
so
did
eric
and
so
did
----
'--then
her
eyes
fell
on
the
ayah
and
she
gave
a
great
start
'charlie'
she
cried
'for
mercy's
sake
look
at
her
i
dare
not
is
she
all
right'
i
turned
the
ayah
over--she
was
dead
fright
had
killed
her
i
then
told
my
wife
of
the
curse
of
nahra
and
of
the
phantom
i
thought
i
had
seen
of
him
when
the
white
tiger
was
springing
when
i
had
finished
my
wife
hid
her
face
in
my
shoulder
'charlie'
she
said
'i
did
something
awful
i
saw
what
i
then
took
to
be
the
real
white
tiger
single
out
eric
and
in
my
anxiety
to
save
him
from
the
brute
i
pushed
the
ayah
in
front
of
him
and
the
thing
sprang
on
her
instead
it
was
nothing
short
of
murder
and
yet--well
there
were
extenuating
circumstances
weren't
there'
'of
course
there
were'
i
said--for
i
verily
believed
o'donnell
fear
had
for
the
time
being
turned
her
brain
on
our
way
home
she
suddenly
called
my
attention
to
eric
'charlie'
she
cried
'what's
that
mark
on
his
cheek
he's
hurt'
i
looked--and
my
heart
turned
sick
within
me
on
the
boy's
cheek
was
a
faint
red
scratch
just
as
might
have
been
caused
by
a
slight
very
slight
contact
with
some
animal's
claw
'sahib'
cushai
whispered
to
me
when
he
saw
it
and
heard
of
our
adventure
'sahib
beware
nahra
was
a
clever
man
he
must
have
used
the
spirit
of
the
white
tiger
as
his
tool
let
the
medicine
man
examine
the
scar'
i
did
so
i
took
eric
to
a
dr
nicholson
who
lived
close
by
he
looked
at
the
wound
curiously
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
to
me--he
was
renowned
for
his
plain
speaking--'mr
de
silva
there's
no
use
beating
about
the
bush
and
prolonging
the
agony
unnecessarily
for
you
and
your
wife
the
boy's
got
leprosy--god
alone
knows
how
at
the
most
he
may
live
six
weeks'
the
shock
of
course
was
terrible
eric
had
to
be
isolated
from
everyone--even
from
those
who
loved
him
best--and
died
within
a
month
'sahib
i
knew'
cushai
said
to
me
the
day
of
the
funeral
'i
knew
some
disaster
would
befall
you
nahra
was
a
wonderful
man
and
his
curse
had
to
be
fulfilled
you
may
rest
assured
however
nothing
further
will
befall
you
for
i
saw
nahra
in
a
vision
this
morning
and
he
told
me
both
his
and
the
white
tiger's
spirit
were
now
on
friendly
terms
and
would
trouble
you
no
more'
my
wife
and
i
left
the
place
at
once
and
for
a
long
time
i
lived
in
a
hell
of
suspense
lest
she
should
develop
the
infernal
disease
by
a
merciful
providence
however
she
did
no
such
thing
but
on
the
contrary
picked
up
in
health
in
the
most
marvellous
fashion
indeed
she
only
told
me
yesterday
she
felt
better
than
she
had
done
for
years
i've
told
you
the
story
o'donnell--and
it
is
true
in
every
detail--because
it
goes
a
long
way
to
substantiate
your
theory
that
animals
as
well
as
human
beings
have
a
future
life
i
am
absolutely
sure
they
have
i
replied
jungle
animals
and
psychic
faculties
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
say
whether
animals
of
the
jungle
possess
psychic
faculties
without
putting
them
to
the
test
and
this
for
obvious
reasons
is
extremely
difficult
but
since
i
have
found
that
such
properties
are
possessed--in
varying
degree--by
all
animals
i
have
tested
it
seems
only
too
probable
that
bears
and
tigers
and
all
beasts
of
prey
are
similarly
endowed
it
would
be
interesting
to
experiment
with
a
beast
of
prey
in
a
haunted
locality
to
observe
to
what
extent
it
would
be
aware
of
the
advent
of
the
unknown
and
to
note
its
behaviour
in
the
actual
presence
of
the
phenomena
part
iii
birds
and
the
unknown
birds
and
the
unknown
as
edgar
allan
poe
has
suggested
in
his
immortal
poem
of
the
raven
there
is
a
strong
link
between
certain
species
of
birds
and
the
unknown
we
all
know
that
vultures
kites
and
crows
scent
dead
bodies
from
a
great
way
off
but
we
don't
all
know
that
these
and
other
kinds
of
birds
possess
in
addition
the
psychic
property
of
scenting
the
advent
not
only
of
the
phantom
of
death
but
of
many
if
not
indeed
all
other
spirits
within
my
knowledge
there
have
been
cases
when
before
a
death
in
the
house
ravens
jackdaws
canaries
magpies
and
even
parrots
have
shown
unmistakable
signs
of
uneasiness
and
distress
the
raven
has
croaked
in
a
high-pitched
abnormal
key
the
jackdaw
and
canary
have
become
silent
and
dejected
from
time
to
time
shivering
the
magpie
even
has
feigned
death
the
parrot
has
shrieked
incessantly
owls
too
are
sure
predictors
of
death
and
may
be
heard
hooting
in
the
most
doleful
manner
outside
the
house
of
anyone
doomed
to
die
shortly
in
an
article
entitled
psychic
records
the
editor
of
the
occult
review
in
the
august
number
1905
supplies
the
following
anecdotes
of
ghosts
of
birds
furnished
him
by
his
correspondents
in
the
autumn
of
1877
my
husband
was
lying
seriously
ill
with
rheumatic
fever
and
i
had
sat
up
several
nights
at
last
the
doctors
insisted
on
my
going
to
bed
and
very
unwillingly
i
retired
to
a
spare
room
while
undressing
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
very
large
white
bird
come
from
the
fireplace
make
a
hovering
circle
round
me
and
finally
go
to
the
top
of
a
large
double
chest
of
drawers
i
was
too
tired
to
trouble
about
it
and
thought
i
would
let
it
remain
until
morning
the
next
morning
i
said
to
the
housemaid
'there
was
a
large
bird
in
the
spare
room
last
night
which
flew
to
the
top
of
the
drawers
see
that
it
is
put
out'
the
nurse
who
was
present
said
'oh
dear
ma'am
i
am
afraid
that
is
an
omen
and
means
the
master
won't
live'
and
she
was
confirmed
in
her
opinion
by
the
maid
saying
she
had
searched
and
there
was
no
trace
of
any
bird
i
was
quite
angry
as
my
husband
was
decidedly
better
had
slept
through
the
night
and
we
thought
the
crisis
had
passed
i
went
to
his
bedside
and
found
him
quietly
sleeping
but
he
never
woke
and
in
about
an
hour
passed
quietly
away
i
thought
no
more
of
the
bird
fancying
i
must
have
been
mistaken
from
being
overtired
some
months
after
my
husband's
death
my
youngest
little
one
was
born
he
lived
for
twelve
months
and
then
had
an
attack
of
bronchitis
he
slept
in
a
cot
in
my
room
and
i
was
undressing
one
night
when
this
same
large
white
bird
came
from
his
cot
floated
round
me
and
disappeared
in
the
fireplace
at
the
time
i
did
not
for
a
moment
think
of
it
as
anything
but
a
strange
coincidence
and
in
no
way
connected
it
with
baby's
illness
the
next
morning
i
was
sitting
by
the
drawing-room
fire
with
baby
on
my
lap
the
doctor
came
in
looked
at
him
sounded
his
chest
and
pronounced
him
much
better
as
he
was
a
friend
of
the
family
he
sat
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
and
was
chatting
in
an
ordinary
way
when
he
suddenly
jumped
up
with
an
exclamation
'why
what
does
this
mean'
and
took
the
child
from
my
arms
quite
dead
for
two
years
we
saw
nothing
more
of
the
white
bird
and
we
had
moved
to
another
place
one
day
i
was
in
my
room
and
my
two
little
girls
aged
six
and
eight
were
standing
at
the
window
watching
a
kitten
in
the
garden
when
suddenly
the
youngest
cried
out
'oh
mamma
look
at
that
great
white
bird'
putting
her
hands
as
if
to
catch
it
exactly
in
the
way
it
flies
round
one
i
saw
nothing
and
the
elder
child
said
'don't
be
silly
jessie
there
is
no
bird'
'but
there
is'
said
the
child
'don't
you
see
there
look
there
it
is'
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
twenty
minutes
past
three
two
days
after
we
received
the
news
that
a
niece
of
mine
had
died
at
twenty
minutes
past
three
the
children
had
never
known
anything
of
the
former
appearances
as
we
had
never
talked
about
it
before
them
we
have
seen
nothing
since
of
the
bird
but
have
for
some
years
had
no
death
in
the
family
so
runs
the
article
in
the
occult
review
and
i
can
corroborate
it
with
similar
experiences
that
have
happened
to
my
friends
and
to
me
some
years
ago
for
instance
a
great
friend
of
my
wife's
died
and
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
a
large
bird
tried
to
fly
in
at
the
window
of
the
room
where
the
corpse
lay
while
shortly
afterwards
an
exactly
similar
bird
visited
the
window
of
my
wife's
and
my
room
in
a
house
several
hundreds
of
miles
away
if
it
was
only
a
coincidence
it
was
a
very
extraordinary
one
then
again
this
spring
just
before
the
death
of
one
of
my
wife's
relatives
a
large
bird
flew
violently
against
the
window-pane
behind
which
my
wife
was
sitting--an
incident
that
had
never
happened
to
her
in
that
house
before
undoubtedly
spirits
in
the
guise
of
birds--most
probably
they
are
the
phantasms
of
birds
that
have
actually
once
lived
on
the
material
plane--are
the
messengers
of
death
a
case
of
bird
haunting
in
east
russia
some
years
ago
the
neighbourhood
of
orskaia
in
east
russia
was
roused
by
an
affair
of
a
very
remarkable
nature
the
body
of
a
handsome
young
peasant
woman
called
marthe
popenkoff
was
found
in
a
lonely
part
of
the
road
between
orskaia
and
orenburg
with
the
skin
of
her
face
and
body
shockingly
torn
and
lacerated
but
without
there
being
any
wounds
deep
enough
to
cause
her
death
which
the
doctor
attributed
to
syncope
the
people
of
orskaia
not
satisfied
with
this
verdict
declared
marthe
had
been
murdered
and
made
such
a
loud
clamour
that
the
editor
of
the
local
paper
at
last
voiced
their
sentiments
in
the
east
russia
chronicle
it
was
then
that
m
durant
a
smart
young
french
engineer
temporarily
residing
in
those
parts
became
interested
in
the
case
and
decided
to
investigate
it
thoroughly
with
this
end
in
view
he
wrote
to
his
friend
m
hersant--a
keen
student
of
the
occult--in
saratova
to
join
him
and
three
days
after
the
despatch
of
his
letter
met
the
latter
at
the
orskaia
railway
station
m
durant
retailed
the
case
as
they
drove
to
his
house
it
is
a
remarkable
affair
in
every
way
he
said
the
woman
was
leading
a
perfectly
respectable
married
life
she
was
hard-working
and
industrious
and
beyond
the
fact
that
she
was
over-indulgent
to
her
children
does
not
seem
to
have
had
any
serious
faults
as
far
as
i
can
ascertain
she
had
no
enemies
nor
secret
lovers
m
hersant
asked
no
she
was
quite
straight
and
you
feel
sure
she
was
murdered
i
do
public
opinion
so
strongly
favours
that
view
did
you
see
the
marks
on
the
woman
i
did
and
could
make
nothing
of
them
after
supper
i
will
take
you
to
see
her
in
the
morgue
what--she
is
still
unburied
yes--but
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
that
in
these
parts
bodies
are
often
kept
for
ten
days--sometimes
even
longer
m
durant
was
as
good
as
his
word
after
they
had
partaken
of
a
somewhat
hasty
meal
they
set
out
to
the
morgue
where
they
made
a
careful
inspection
of
the
poor
woman's
remains
m
hersant
examined
the
marks
on
the
woman's
body
very
closely
with
his
magnifying-glass
ah
he
suddenly
exclaimed
bending
down
and
almost
touching
the
corpse
with
his
nose
ah
have
you
made
a
discovery
m
durant
enquired
i
prefer
not
to
say
at
present
m
hersant
replied
i
should
like
to
see
the
spot
where
this
body
was
found--now
we
will
go
there
at
once
m
durant
rejoined
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
was
the
orenburg
road
at
the
foot
of
two
little
hills
and
on
either
side
were
the
sloping
fields
yellow
with
the
nodding
corn
that
is
the
exact
place
where
she
lay
m
durant
said
indicating
with
his
finger
a
dark
patch
on
a
little
wooden
bridge
spanning
a
stream
within
a
stone's
throw
of
a
tumbledown
mill-house
all
overgrown
with
ivy
and
lichens
m
hersant
looked
round
and
sniffed
the
air
with
his
nostrils
there
is
an
air
of
loneliness
about
this
spot
he
remarked
that
in
itself
suggests
crime
if
this
were
an
ordinary
murder
one
could
well
imagine
the
assassin
was
aided
in
his
diabolical
work
by
the
configuration
of
the
land
which
shelving
as
it
does
slips
down
into
the
narrow
valley
so
as
to
preclude
any
possibility
of
escape
on
the
part
of
the
victim
the
place
seems
especially
designed
by
providence
as
a
death-trap
let
us
have
a
look
at
the
interior
of
this
building
the
police
have
searched
it
thoroughly
m
durant
said
i've
no
doubt
m
hersant
replied
drily
no
one
knows
better
than
i
what
the
thoroughness
of
the
police
means
they
entered
the
premises
cautiously
since
the
roof
was
in
a
rickety
condition
and
any
slight
concussion
might
dislodge
an
avalanche
of
stones
and
plaster
while
m
durant
stood
glancing
round
him
rather
impatiently
m
hersant
made
a
careful
scrutiny
of
the
walls
humph
he
said
at
last
as
you
so
rightly
observed
henri
this
is
a
remarkable
case
i
have
finished
my
investigation
for
to-night
let
us
be
going
home
to-morrow
i
should
like
to
visit
marthe's
home
this
conversation
took
place
shortly
before
midnight
some
six
hours
later
all
orskaia
was
ringing
with
the
news
that
marthe
popenkoff's
three
children
had
all
been
found
dead
in
their
beds
their
faces
and
bodies
lacerated
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
their
mother's
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
now
that
marthe
had
been
murdered
and
the
populace
cried
shame
on
the
police
for
the
assassin
was
still
at
large
they
agreed
that
the
murderer
could
be
no
other
than
peter
popenkoff
and
the
editor
of
the
local
paper
repeating
these
statements
peter
popenkoff
was
duly
charged
with
the
crimes
and
arrested
he
was
pronounced
guilty
by
all
excepting
m
hersant
and
of
course
m
hersant
thought
him
guilty
too
only
he
liked
to
think
differently
from
anyone
else
i
don't
want
to
commit
myself
was
all
they
could
get
out
of
him
i
may
have
something
to
say
later
on
m
durant
laughed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
undoubtedly
is
peter
popenkoff
he
observed
i
had
an
idea
that
he
was
the
culprit
all
along
but
a
day
or
two
later
peter
popenkoff
was
found
dead
in
prison
with
the
skin
on
his
face
and
hands
all
torn
to
shreds
there
didn't
we
say
so
cried
the
inconsequent
mob
peter
popenkoff
was
innocent
one
of
the
police
themselves
is
the
murderer
come
you
must
acknowledge
that
we
are
on
the
right
track
now--it
is
one
of
the
police
m
durant
said
to
his
friend
but
m
hersant
only
shook
his
head
i
acknowledge
nothing
of
the
sort
he
said
come
with
me
to
the
mill-house
to-night
and
i
will
then
tell
you
what
i
think
to
this
proposition
m
durant
willingly
agreed
and
accompanied
by
his
friend
and
the
village
priest
set
off
on
their
arrival
m
hersant
produced
a
big
compass
and
on
the
earth
floor
of
the
mill-house
drew
a
large
circle
in
which
he
made
with
white
chalk
various
signs
and
symbols
he
then
sat
in
the
middle
of
it
and
bade
his
two
companions
stand
in
the
doorway
and
watch
the
night
grew
darker
and
darker
and
presently
into
the
air
stole
a
something
that
all
three
men
at
once
realized
was
supernatural
m
hersant
coughed
nervously
the
priest
crossed
himself
and
m
durant
called
out
this
is
getting
ridiculous
these
mediã¦val
proceedings
are
too
absurd
let
us
go
home
the
next
moment
from
the
far
distance
a
church
clock
began
to
strike
it
was
midnight
and
an
impressive
silence
fell
on
the
trio
then
there
came
a
noise
like
the
flutterings
of
wings
a
loud
blood-curdling
scream
half
human
and
half
animal
and
a
huge
black
owl
whirling
down
from
the
roof
of
the
building
perched
in
the
circle
directly
in
front
of
m
hersant
pray
father
pray
quickly
m
hersant
whispered
pray
for
the
dead
and
sprinkle
the
circle
with
holy
water
the
priest
as
well
as
his
trembling
limbs
would
allow
obeyed
whereupon
the
bird
instantly
vanished
for
heaven's
sake
m
durant
gasped
tell
us
what
it
all
means
only
this
m
hersant
said
solemnly
the
phantasm
we
saw
caused
the
death
of
the
popenkoff
family
it
is
the
spirit
of
an
owl
that
the
children
encouraged
by
their
parents
killed
in
a
most
cruel
manner
as
soon
as
i
examined
marthe's
body
i
perceived
the
mutilations
were
due
to
a
bird
and
when
i
visited
this
mill
on
the
eve
of
my
arrival
i
knew
that
a
bird
had
once
lived
here
that
it
had
been
captured
with
lime
and
murdered
and
that
it
haunted
the
place
how
could
you
know
that
the
priest
exclaimed
in
astonishment
i
am
clairvoyant
i
saw
the
bird's
ghost
as
it
appeared
to
us
just
now
afterwards
i
enquired
of
the
popenkoffs'
neighbours
and
the
information
i
gathered
fully
confirmed
my
suspicions--that
the
unfortunate
bird
had
been
put
to
death
in
a
most
barbarous
manner
the
deaths
of
the
three
children
laid
to
rest
any
doubt
i
may
have
had
with
regard
to
the
superphysical
playing
a
part
in
the
death
of
marthe
then
when
her
better-half
had
been
served
likewise
i
was
certain
that
all
five
pseudo-murders
were
wholly
and
solely
acts
of
retribution
and
that
they
were
perpetrated--i
am
inclined
to
think
involuntarily--by
the
spirit
of
the
owl
itself
accordingly
i
decided
to
hold
a
sã©ance
here--here
in
its
old
haunt
and
if
possible
to
put
an
end
to
the
earth-bound
condition
and
wanderings
of
the
soul
of
the
unhappy
bird
thanks
to
father
mickledoff
we
have
done
so
and
there
will
be
no
more
so-called
murders
near
orskaia
hauntings
by
the
phantasms
of
birds
one
of
the
most
curious
cases
of
hauntings
by
the
phantasms
of
birds
happened
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
a
church
not
twenty
miles
from
london
the
sexton
started
the
rumours
declaring
that
he
had
heard
strange
noises
apparently
proceeding
from
certain
vaults
containing
the
tombs
of
two
old
and
distinguished
families
the
noises
which
generally
occurred
on
friday
nights
most
often
took
the
form
of
mockings
suggesting
to
some
of
the
listeners--the
enaction
of
a
murder
and
to
others
merely
the
flapping
of
wings
the
case
soon
attracted
considerable
attention
people
flocking
to
the
church
from
all
over
the
country-side
and
it
was
not
long
before
certain
persons
came
forward
and
declared
they
had
ascertained
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
the
churchwarden
sexton
and
his
wife
and
others
all
swore
to
seeing
a
huge
crow
pecking
and
clawing
at
the
coffins
in
the
vaults
and
flying
about
the
chancel
of
the
church
and
perching
on
the
communion
rails
when
they
tried
to
seize
it
it
immediately
vanished
an
old
lady
who
came
of
a
family
of
well-to-do
yeomen
and
who
lived
near
the
church
about
that
time
said
that
the
people
in
the
town
had
for
many
years
been
convinced
the
church
there
was
haunted
by
the
phantom
of
a
bird
which
they
believed
to
be
the
earth-bound
soul
of
a
murderer
who
owing
to
his
wealth
was
interred
in
the
churchyard
instead
of
being
buried
at
the
cross-roads
with
the
customary
wooden
stake
driven
through
the
middle
of
his
body
this
belief
of
the
yokels
received
some
corroboration
from
a
neighbouring
squire
who
said
he
had
seen
the
phantasm
and
was
quite
positive
it
was
the
earth-bound
soul
of
a
criminal
whose
family
history
was
known
to
him
and
whose
remains
lay
in
the
churchyard
this
is
all
the
information
that
i
have
been
able
to
gather
on
the
subject
but
it
is
enough
to
at
least
suggest
the
church
was
at
one
time
haunted
by
the
phantom
of
a
bird
but
whether
the
earth-bound
soul
of
a
murderer
taking
that
guise
or
the
spirit
of
an
actual
dead
bird
it
is
impossible
to
say
the
ghost
of
an
evil
bird
henry
spicer
in
his
strange
things
amongst
us
tells
the
story
of
a
captain
morgan
an
honourable
and
vivacious
gentleman
who
arriving
in
london
in
18--
puts
up
for
the
night
in
a
large
old-fashioned
hotel
the
room
in
which
he
slept
was
full
of
heavy
antique
furniture
reminiscent
of
the
days
of
king
george
i
one
of
the
worst
periods
in
modern
english
history
for
crime
despite
however
his
grimly
suggestive
surroundings
captain
morgan
quickly
got
into
bed
and
was
soon
asleep
he
was
abruptly
awakened
by
the
sound
of
flapping
and
on
looking
up
he
saw
a
huge
black
bird
with
outstretched
wings
and
fiery
red
eyes
perched
on
the
rail
at
the
foot
of
the
four-poster
bed
the
creature
flew
at
him
and
endeavoured
to
peck
his
eyes
captain
morgan
resisted
and
after
a
desperate
struggle
succeeded
in
driving
it
to
a
sofa
in
the
corner
of
the
room
where
it
settled
down
and
regarded
him
with
great
fear
in
its
eyes
determined
to
destroy
it
he
flung
himself
on
the
top
of
it
when
to
his
surprise
and
terror
it
immediately
crumbled
into
nothingness
he
left
the
house
early
next
morning
convinced
that
what
he
had
seen
was
a
ghost
but
mr
spicer
offers
no
explanation
as
to
how
one
should
classify
the
phenomenon
it
may
have
been
the
earth-bound
spirit
of
the
criminal
or
viciously
inclined
person
who
had
once
lived
there
or
it
may
have
been
the
phantom
of
an
actual
bird
either
alternative
is
feasible
i
have
heard
there
is
an
old
house
near
poole
in
dorset
and
another
in
essex
which
were
formerly
haunted
by
spectral
birds
and
that
as
late
as
1860
the
phantasm
of
a
bird
many
times
the
size
of
a
raven
was
so
frequently
seen
by
the
inmates
of
a
house
in
dean
street
soho
that
they
eventually
grew
quite
accustomed
to
it
but
bird
hauntings
are
not
confined
to
houses
and
are
far
more
often
to
be
met
with
out
of
doors
indeed
there
are
very
few
woods
and
moors
and
commons
that
are
not
subjected
to
them
i
have
constantly
seen
the
spirits
of
all
manner
of
birds
in
the
parks
in
dublin
and
london
greenwich
park
in
particular
is
full
of
them
addendum
to
birds
and
the
unknown
though
their
unlovely
aspect
and
solitary
mode
of
life
may
in
some
measure
account
for
the
prejudice
and
suspicion
with
which
the
owl
crow
raven
and
one
or
two
other
birds
have
always
been
regarded
there
are
undoubtedly
other
and
more
subtle
reasons
for
their
unpopularity
the
ancients
without
exception
credited
these
birds
with
psychic
properties

ill-fortune

the
dirge
in
cornwall
writes
mr
hunt
in
his
work
on
popular
beliefs
etc
of
the
west
of
england
it
is
believed
that
the
croaking
of
a
raven
over
the
house
bodes
evil
to
some
of
the
family
the
following
incident
given
to
me
by
a
really
intelligent
man
illustrates
the
feeling
'one
day
our
family
were
much
annoyed
by
the
continual
croaking
of
a
raven
over
the
house
some
of
us
believed
it
to
be
a
token
others
derided
the
idea
but
one
good
lady
our
next-door
neighbour
said
'just
mark
the
day
and
see
if
something
does
not
come
of
it
'the
day
and
hour
were
carefully
noted
months
passed
away
and
unbelievers
were
loud
in
their
boastings
and
enquiries
after
the
token
the
fifth
month
arrived
and
with
it
a
black-edged
letter
from
australia
announcing
the
death
of
one
of
the
members
of
the
family
in
that
country
on
comparing
the
dates
of
the
death
and
the
raven's
croak
they
were
found
to
have
occurred
on
the
same
day'
in
an
old
number
of
notes
and
queries
a
correspondent
relates
that
in
somersetshire
the
appearance
of
a
single
jackdaw
is
regarded
as
a
sure
prognostication
of
evil
he
goes
on
to
add
that
the
men
employed
in
the
quarries
in
the
avon
gorge
clifton
bristol
had
more
than
once
noticed
a
jackdaw
perched
on
the
chain
that
spanned
the
river
prior
to
some
catastrophe
among
them
dead
magpies
were
once
hung
over
the
doorways
of
haunted
houses
to
keep
away
ghosts
it
being
almost
universally
believed
that
all
phantasms
shared
the
same
dread
of
this
bird
ghosts
of
magpies
themselves
are
however
far
from
uncommon
on
dartmoor
and
exmoor
for
example
i
have
seen
several
of
them
generally
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
bogs
or
deep
holes
witches
were
much
attached
to
this
bird
and
were
said
to
often
assume
its
shape
after
death
magpies
says
mr
william
jones
in
his
credulities
past
and
present
are
mysterious
everywhere
a
lady
living
near
carlstad
in
sweden
grievously
offended
a
farm
woman
who
came
into
the
court
of
her
house
asking
for
food
the
woman
was
told
'to
take
that
magpie
hanging
upon
the
wall
and
eat
it'
she
took
the
bird
and
disappeared
with
an
evil
glance
at
the
lady
who
had
been
so
ill-advised
as
to
insult
a
finn
whose
magical
powers
it
is
well
known
far
exceed
those
of
the
gipsies
other
authorities
corroborate
this
statement
and
i
have
heard
it
said
that
the
finns
can
surpass
even
the
famous
tricks
of
the
indians
mr
jones
in
the
same
story
says
presently
the
number
increased
and
the
lady
who
at
first
had
been
amused
became
troubled
and
tried
to
drive
them
away
by
various
devices
all
was
to
no
purpose
she
could
not
move
without
a
large
company
of
magpies
and
they
became
at
length
so
daring
as
to
hop
on
her
shoulder
this
reads
like
hallucination
however
as
i
have
heard
of
similar
cases
in
which
there
has
been
no
doubt
as
to
the
objectivity
of
the
phenomena
i
see
no
reason
why
these
magpies
should
not
have
been
objective
too
then
she
took
to
her
bed
in
a
room
with
closed
shutters
although
even
this
was
not
an
effectual
protection
for
the
magpies
kept
tapping
at
the
shutters
day
and
night
mr
jones
adds
the
lady's
death
is
not
recorded
but
it
is
fully
expected
that
die
when
she
may
all
the
magpies
of
wermland
will
be
present
at
her
funeral
there
is
a
house
in
great
russell
street
wc
where
the
hauntings
take
the
form
of
a
magpie
that
taps
at
one
of
the
windows
every
morning
between
two
and

inside
the
room
perched
on
what
looks
like
a
huge
alpine
stick
suspended
horizontally
in
the
air
about
seven
feet
from
the
floor
the
moment
a
sound
is
made
the
apparition
vanishes
it
is
thought
to
be
the
spirit
of
a
magpie
that
was
done
to
death
in
a
very
cruel
manner
in
that
room
many
years
ago
there
is
a
story
current
to
the
effect
that
a
lady
when
visiting
the
british
museum
one
day
happened
to
pass
some
slighting
remark
about
one
of
the
egyptian
mummy
cases
not
the
notorious
one
and
that
on
quitting
the
building
she
felt
a
sharp
peck
on
her
neck
she
put
up
her
hand
to
the
injured
part
and
felt
the
distinct
impression
of
a
bird's
claw
on
it
she
could
see
nothing
however
that
night--and
for
every
succeeding
night
for
six
weeks--she
was
awakened
at
two
o'clock
by
the
phantom
of
an
enormous
magpie
that
fluttered
over
the
bed
and
was
clearly
visible
to
herself
and
her
sister
the
phenomenon
worried
her
so
that
she
became
ill
and
was
eventually
ordered
abroad
she
went
to
cairo
and
enjoyed
a
brief
respite
the
hauntings
however
began
again
and
this
time
became
so
persistent
that
she
at
last
lost
her
reason
and
had
to
be
brought
home
and
confined
in
a
private
asylum
where
she
shortly
afterwards
died
though
i
cannot
vouch
for
the
truth
of
this
story
i
do
think
it
is
somewhat
risky
to
make
fun
of
certain
of
the
egyptian
relics
in
the
museum
they
may
be
haunted
by
something
infinitely
more
alarming
than
the
ghosts
of
magpies
there
are
many
sayings
respecting
the
magpie
as
a
harbinger
of
ill
luck
in
lancashire

example

is

rhyme

rooks

are
very
psychic
birds
they
always
leave
their
haunts
near
an
old
house
shortly
before
a
death
takes
place
in
it
because
their
highly
developed
psychic
faculty
of
scent
enables
them
to
detect
the
advent
of
the
phantom
of
death
of
which
they
have
the

horror
a

is
of
great
service
when

that

are

that
their

young
cock

must
be
taken
as

dire
calamity

improvement
in
our
treatment
of
all
the
so-called
brute
creation--and
god
alone
knows
how
much
such
an
improvement
is
needed--would
speedily
result
it
is
still
only
the
comparative
few
who
are
kind
to
animals--the
majority
are
either
wholly
indifferent
or
absolutely
cruel

if
children
were
made
to
realize
that
even

have

hitherto

the

unjustifiable
idea
that
all
the

insect
world
has
been
created
solely
for
his
benefit
to
be
killed
or
to
be
kept
alive
entirely
at
his
discretion
such
an
absurd
and
presumptuous
belief
ought
to
be
exploded

for
all

animal

all
sane
people
must
agree

undoubtedly
created

lead

untrammelled
life

does

in
cunning--is
nothing
superior
either
to
the
dog
horse
or
other
mammalia
indeed
he
is
not
infrequently
so
inferior
that
one
cannot
help
thinking
that
possibly
the
higher
spiritual
planes
are
not
for
him
at
all
but
for
those
who--misnamed
the
lower
creation--have
surpassed
man
in
spirituality
let
those
who
doubt
this
study
the
superphysical
all
around
them
let
them
carefully
watch
animals
and
observe
their
propensities
their
psychic
faculties
of
scent
sight
and
hearing
they
can
easily
test
them
in
any
house
or
locality
which
has
a
well-established
reputation
for
being
haunted
they
will
then
see
how
close
a
relationship
there
really
is
between
the
animal
and
superphysical
worlds
and
if
they
want
further
proof--proof
of
a
more
material
nature--let
them
search
around
for
some
spot
stated
to
be
haunted
by
a
ghostly
phenomenon
in
the
form
of
a
dog
horse
cat
or
other
animal--and
investigate
there
themselves
such
investigations
have
convinced
me
and
surely
by
using
these
same
methods
with
patience
and
perseverance
other
people
might
also
be
convinced
at
all
events
let
them
try
for
a
conviction
like
mine--a
conviction
that
an
eternity
exists
for
our
canine
pets
and
dumb
friends--is
certainly
worth
