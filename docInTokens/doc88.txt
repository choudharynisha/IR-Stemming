on
the
22d
of
september
i
was
asked
by
the
world
if
i
could
have
myself
committed
to
one
of
the
asylums
for
the
insane
in
new
york
with
a
view
to
writing
a
plain
and
unvarnished
narrative
of
the
treatment
of
the
patients
therein
and
the
methods
of
management
etc
did
i
think
i
had
the
courage
to
go
through
such
an
ordeal
as
the
mission
would
demand
could
i
assume
the
characteristics
of
insanity
to
such
a
degree
that
i
could
pass
the
doctors
live
for
a
week
among
the
insane
without
the
authorities
there
finding
out
that
i
was
only
a
â€œchiel
amang
â€™em
takinâ€™
notesâ€
i
said
i
believed
i
could
i
had
some
faith
in
my
own
ability
as
an
actress
and
thought
i
could
assume
insanity
long
enough
to
accomplish
any
mission
intrusted
to
me
could
i
pass
a
week
in
the
insane
ward
at
blackwellâ€™s
island
i
said
i
could
and
i
would
and
i
did
my
instructions
were
simply
to
go
on
with
my
work
as
soon
as
i
felt
that
i
was
ready
i
was
to
chronicle
faithfully
the
experiences
i
underwent
and
when
once
within
the
walls
of
the
asylum
to
find
out
and
describe
its
inside
workings
which
are
always
so
effectually
hidden
by
white-capped
nurses
as
well
as
by
bolts
and
bars
from
the
knowledge
of
the
public
â€œwe
do
not
ask
you
to
go
there
for
the
purpose
of
making
sensational
revelations
write
up
things
as
you
find
them
good
or
bad
give
praise
or
blame
as
you
think
best
and
the
truth
all
the
time
but
i
am
afraid
of
that
chronic
smile
of
yoursâ€
said
the
editor
â€œi
will
smile
no
moreâ€
i
said
and
i
went
away
to
execute
my
delicate
and
as
i
found
out
difficult
mission
if
i
did
get
into
the
asylum
which
i
hardly
hoped
to
do
i
had
no
idea
that
my
experiences
would
contain
aught
else
than
a
simple
tale
of
life
in
an
asylum
that
such
an
institution
could
be
mismanaged
and
that
cruelties
could
exist
â€™neath
its
roof
i
did
not
deem
possible
i
always
had
a
desire
to
know
asylum
life
more
thoroughlyâ€”a
desire
to
be
convinced
that
the
most
helpless
of
godâ€™s
creatures
the
insane
were
cared
for
kindly
and
properly
the
many
stories
i
had
read
of
abuses
in
such
institutions
i
had
regarded
as
wildly
exaggerated
or
else
romances
yet
there
was
a
latent
desire
to
know
positively
i
shuddered
to
think
how
completely
the
insane
were
in
the
power
of
their
keepers
and
how
one
could
weep
and
plead
for
release
and
all
of
no
avail
if
the
keepers
were
so
minded
eagerly
i
accepted
the
mission
to
learn
the
inside
workings
of
the
blackwell
island
insane
asylum
â€œhow
will
you
get
me
outâ€
i
asked
my
editor
â€œafter
i
once
get
inâ€
â€œi
do
not
knowâ€
he
replied
â€œbut
we
will
get
you
out
if
we
have
to
tell
who
you
are
and
for
what
purpose
you
feigned
insanityâ€”only
get
inâ€
i
had
little
belief
in
my
ability
to
deceive
the
insanity
experts
and
i
think
my
editor
had
less
all
the
preliminary
preparations
for
my
ordeal
were
left
to
be
planned
by
myself
only
one
thing
was
decided
upon
namely
that
i
should
pass
under
the
pseudonym
of
nellie
brown
the
initials
of
which
would
agree
with
my
own
name
and
my
linen
so
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
keeping
track
of
my
movements
and
assisting
me
out
of
any
difficulties
or
dangers
i
might
get
into
there
were
ways
of
getting
into
the
insane
ward
but
i
did
not
know
them
i
might
adopt
one
of
two
courses
either
i
could
feign
insanity
at
the
house
of
friends
and
get
myself
committed
on
the
decision
of
two
competent
physicians
or
i
could
go
to
my
goal
by
way
of
the
police
courts
illustration
nellie
practices
insanity
at
home
on
reflection
i
thought
it
wiser
not
to
inflict
myself
upon
my
friends
or
to
get
any
good-natured
doctors
to
assist
me
in
my
purpose
besides
to
get
to
blackwellâ€™s
island
my
friends
would
have
had
to
feign
poverty
and
unfortunately
for
the
end
i
had
in
view
my
acquaintance
with
the
struggling
poor
except
my
own
self
was
only
very
superficial
so
i
determined
upon
the
plan
which
led
me
to
the
successful
accomplishment
of
my
mission
i
succeeded
in
getting
committed
to
the
insane
ward
at
blackwellâ€™s
island
where
i
spent
ten
days
and
nights
and
had
an
experience
which
i
shall
never
forget
i
took
upon
myself
to
enact
the
part
of
a
poor
unfortunate
crazy
girl
and
felt
it
my
duty
not
to
shirk
any
of
the
disagreeable
results
that
should
follow
i
became
one
of
the
cityâ€™s
insane
wards
for
that
length
of
time
experienced
much
and
saw
and
heard
more
of
the
treatment
accorded
to
this
helpless
class
of
our
population
and
when
i
had
seen
and
heard
enough
my
release
was
promptly
secured
i
left
the
insane
ward
with
pleasure
and
regretâ€”pleasure
that
i
was
once
more
able
to
enjoy
the
free
breath
of
heaven
regret
that
i
could
not
have
brought
with
me
some
of
the
unfortunate
women
who
lived
and
suffered
with
me
and
who
i
am
convinced
are
just
as
sane
as
i
was
and
am
now
myself
but
here
let
me
say
one
thing
from
the
moment
i
entered
the
insane
ward
on
the
island
i
made
no
attempt
to
keep
up
the
assumed
role
of
insanity
i
talked
and
acted
just
as
i
do
in
ordinary
life
yet
strange
to
say
the
more
sanely
i
talked
and
acted
the
crazier
i
was
thought
to
be
by
all
except
one
physician
whose
kindness
and
gentle
ways
i
shall
not
soon
forget
preparing
for
the
ordeal
but
to
return
to
my
work
and
my
mission
after
receiving
my
instructions
i
returned
to
my
boarding-house
and
when
evening
came
i
began
to
practice
the
role
in
which
i
was
to
make
my
debut
on
the
morrow
what
a
difficult
task
i
thought
to
appear
before
a
crowd
of
people
and
convince
them
that
i
was
insane
i
had
never
been
near
insane
persons
before
in
my
life
and
had
not
the
faintest
idea
of
what
their
actions
were
like
and
then
to
be
examined
by
a
number
of
learned
physicians
who
make
insanity
a
specialty
and
who
daily
come
in
contact
with
insane
people
how
could
i
hope
to
pass
these
doctors
and
convince
them
that
i
was
crazy
i
feared
that
they
could
not
be
deceived
i
began
to
think
my
task
a
hopeless
one
but
it
had
to
be
done
so
i
flew
to
the
mirror
and
examined
my
face
i
remembered
all
i
had
read
of
the
doings
of
crazy
people
how
first
of
all
they
must
have
staring
eyes
and
so
i
opened
mine
as
wide
as
possible
and
stared
unblinkingly
at
my
own
reflection
i
assure
you
the
sight
was
not
reassuring
even
to
myself
especially
in
the
dead
of
night
i
tried
to
turn
the
gas
up
higher
in
hopes
that
it
would
raise
my
courage
i
succeeded
only
partially
but
i
consoled
myself
with
the
thought
that
in
a
few
nights
more
i
would
not
be
there
but
locked
up
in
a
cell
with
a
lot
of
lunatics
the
weather
was
not
cold
but
nevertheless
when
i
thought
of
what
was
to
come
wintery
chills
ran
races
up
and
down
my
back
in
very
mockery
of
the
perspiration
which
was
slowly
but
surely
taking
the
curl
out
of
my
bangs
between
times
practicing
before
the
mirror
and
picturing
my
future
as
a
lunatic
i
read
snatches
of
improbable
and
impossible
ghost
stories
so
that
when
the
dawn
came
to
chase
away
the
night
i
felt
that
i
was
in
a
fit
mood
for
my
mission
yet
hungry
enough
to
feel
keenly
that
i
wanted
my
breakfast
slowly
and
sadly
i
took
my
morning
bath
and
quietly
bade
farewell
to
a
few
of
the
most
precious
articles
known
to
modern
civilization
tenderly
i
put
my
tooth-brush
aside
and
when
taking
a
final
rub
of
the
soap
i
murmured
â€œit
may
be
for
days
and
it
may
beâ€”for
longerâ€
then
i
donned
the
old
clothing
i
had
selected
for
the
occasion
i
was
in
the
mood
to
look
at
everything
through
very
serious
glasses
itâ€™s
just
as
well
to
take
a
last
â€œfond
lookâ€
i
mused
for
who
could
tell
but
that
the
strain
of
playing
crazy
and
being
shut
up
with
a
crowd
of
mad
people
might
turn
my
own
brain
and
i
would
never
get
back
but
not
once
did
i
think
of
shirking
my
mission
calmly
outwardly
at
least
i
went
out
to
my
crazy
business
i
first
thought
it
best
to
go
to
a
boarding-house
and
after
securing
lodging
confidentially
tell
the
landlady
or
lord
whichever
it
might
chance
to
be
that
i
was
seeking
work
and
in
a
few
days
after
apparently
go
insane
when
i
reconsidered
the
idea
i
feared
it
would
take
too
long
to
mature
suddenly
i
thought
how
much
easier
it
would
be
to
go
to
a
boarding-home
for
working
women
i
knew
if
once
i
made
a
houseful
of
women
believe
me
crazy
that
they
would
never
rest
until
i
was
out
of
their
reach
and
in
secure
quarters
from
a
directory
i
selected
the
temporary
home
for
females
no
84
second
avenue
as
i
walked
down
the
avenue
i
determined
that
once
inside
the
home
i
should
do
the
best
i
could
to
get
started
on
my
journey
to
blackwellâ€™s
island
and
the
insane
asylum
in
the
temporary
home
i
was
left
to
begin
my
career
as
nellie
brown
the
insane
girl
as
i
walked
down
the
avenue
i
tried
to
assume
the
look
which
maidens
wear
in
pictures
entitled
â€œdreamingâ€
â€œfar-awayâ€
expressions
have
a
crazy
air
i
passed
through
the
little
paved
yard
to
the
entrance
of
the
home
i
pulled
the
bell
which
sounded
loud
enough
for
a
church
chime
and
nervously
awaited
the
opening
of
the
door
to
the
home
which
i
intended
should
ere
long
cast
me
forth
and
out
upon
the
charity
of
the
police
the
door
was
thrown
back
with
a
vengeance
and
a
short
yellow-haired
girl
of
some
thirteen
summers
stood
before
me
â€œis
the
matron
inâ€
i
asked
faintly
â€œyes
sheâ€™s
in
sheâ€™s
busy
go
to
the
back
parlorâ€
answered
the
girl
in
a
loud
voice
without
one
change
in
her
peculiarly
matured
face
illustration
at
the
temporary
home
for
women
i
followed
these
not
overkind
or
polite
instructions
and
found
myself
in
a
dark
uncomfortable
back-parlor
there
i
awaited
the
arrival
of
my
hostess
i
had
been
seated
some
twenty
minutes
at
the
least
when
a
slender
woman
clad
in
a
plain
dark
dress
entered
and
stopping
before
me
ejaculated
inquiringly
â€œwellâ€
â€œare
you
the
matronâ€
i
asked
â€œnoâ€
she
replied
â€œthe
matron
is
sick
i
am
her
assistant
what
do
you
wantâ€
â€œi
want
to
stay
here
for
a
few
days
if
you
can
accommodate
meâ€
â€œwell
i
have
no
single
rooms
we
are
so
crowded
but
if
you
will
occupy
a
room
with
another
girl
i
shall
do
that
much
for
youâ€
â€œi
shall
be
glad
of
thatâ€
i
answered
â€œhow
much
do
you
chargeâ€
i
had
brought
only
about
seventy
cents
along
with
me
knowing
full
well
that
the
sooner
my
funds
were
exhausted
the
sooner
i
should
be
put
out
and
to
be
put
out
was
what
i
was
working
for
â€œwe
charge
thirty
cents
a
nightâ€
was
her
reply
to
my
question
and
with
that
i
paid
her
for
one
nightâ€™s
lodging
and
she
left
me
on
the
plea
of
having
something
else
to
look
after
left
to
amuse
myself
as
best
i
could
i
took
a
survey
of
my
surroundings
they
were
not
cheerful
to
say
the
least
a
wardrobe
desk
book-case
organ
and
several
chairs
completed
the
furnishment
of
the
room
into
which
the
daylight
barely
came
by
the
time
i
had
become
familiar
with
my
quarters
a
bell
which
rivaled
the
door-bell
in
its
loudness
began
clanging
in
the
basement
and
simultaneously
women
went
trooping
down-stairs
from
all
parts
of
the
house
i
imagined
from
the
obvious
signs
that
dinner
was
served
but
as
no
one
had
said
anything
to
me
i
made
no
effort
to
follow
in
the
hungry
train
yet
i
did
wish
that
some
one
would
invite
me
down
it
always
produces
such
a
lonely
homesick
feeling
to
know
others
are
eating
and
we
havenâ€™t
a
chance
even
if
we
are
not
hungry
i
was
glad
when
the
assistant
matron
came
up
and
asked
me
if
i
did
not
want
something
to
eat
i
replied
that
i
did
and
then
i
asked
her
what
her
name
was
mrs
stanard
she
said
and
i
immediately
wrote
it
down
in
a
notebook
i
had
taken
with
me
for
the
purpose
of
making
memoranda
and
in
which
i
had
written
several
pages
of
utter
nonsense
for
inquisitive
scientists
thus
equipped
i
awaited
developments
but
my
dinnerâ€”well
i
followed
mrs
stanard
down
the
uncarpeted
stairs
into
the
basement
where
a
large
number
of
women
were
eating
she
found
room
for
me
at
a
table
with
three
other
women
the
short-haired
slavey
who
had
opened
the
door
now
put
in
an
appearance
as
waiter
placing
her
arms
akimbo
and
staring
me
out
of
countenance
she
said
â€œboiled
mutton
boiled
beef
beans
potatoes
coffee
or
teaâ€
â€œbeef
potatoes
coffee
and
breadâ€
i
responded
â€œbread
goes
inâ€
she
explained
as
she
made
her
way
to
the
kitchen
which
was
in
the
rear
it
was
not
very
long
before
she
returned
with
what
i
had
ordered
on
a
large
badly
battered
tray
which
she
banged
down
before
me
i
began
my
simple
meal
it
was
not
very
enticing
so
while
making
a
feint
of
eating
i
watched
the
others
i
have
often
moralized
on
the
repulsive
form
charity
always
assumes
here
was
a
home
for
deserving
women
and
yet
what
a
mockery
the
name
was
the
floor
was
bare
and
the
little
wooden
tables
were
sublimely
ignorant
of
such
modern
beautifiers
as
varnish
polish
and
table-covers
it
is
useless
to
talk
about
the
cheapness
of
linen
and
its
effect
on
civilization
yet
these
honest
workers
the
most
deserving
of
women
are
asked
to
call
this
spot
of
barenessâ€”home
when
the
meal
was
finished
each
woman
went
to
the
desk
in
the
corner
where
mrs
stanard
sat
and
paid
her
bill
i
was
given
a
much-used
and
abused
red
check
by
the
original
piece
of
humanity
in
shape
of
my
waitress
my
bill
was
about
thirty
cents
after
dinner
i
went
up-stairs
and
resumed
my
former
place
in
the
back
parlor
i
was
quite
cold
and
uncomfortable
and
had
fully
made
up
my
mind
that
i
could
not
endure
that
sort
of
business
long
so
the
sooner
i
assumed
my
insane
points
the
sooner
i
would
be
released
from
enforced
idleness
ah
that
was
indeed
the
longest
day
i
had
ever
lived
i
listlessly
watched
the
women
in
the
front
parlor
where
all
sat
except
myself
one
did
nothing
but
read
and
scratch
her
head
and
occasionally
call
out
mildly
â€œgeorgieâ€
without
lifting
her
eyes
from
her
book
â€œgeorgieâ€
was
her
over-frisky
boy
who
had
more
noise
in
him
than
any
child
i
ever
saw
before
he
did
everything
that
was
rude
and
unmannerly
i
thought
and
the
mother
never
said
a
word
unless
she
heard
some
one
else
yell
at
him
another
woman
always
kept
going
to
sleep
and
waking
herself
up
with
her
own
snoring
i
really
felt
wickedly
thankful
it
was
only
herself
she
awakened
the
majority
of
the
women
sat
there
doing
nothing
but
there
were
a
few
who
made
lace
and
knitted
unceasingly
the
enormous
door-bell
seemed
to
be
going
all
the
time
and
so
did
the
short-haired
girl
the
latter
was
besides
one
of
those
girls
who
sing
all
the
time
snatches
of
all
the
songs
and
hymns
that
have
been
composed
for
the
last
fifty
years
there
is
such
a
thing
as
martyrdom
in
these
days
the
ringing
of
the
bell
brought
more
people
who
wanted
shelter
for
the
night
excepting
one
woman
who
was
from
the
country
on
a
dayâ€™s
shopping
expedition
they
were
working
women
some
of
them
with
children
as
it
drew
toward
evening
mrs
stanard
came
to
me
and
said
â€œwhat
is
wrong
with
you
have
you
some
sorrow
or
troubleâ€
â€œnoâ€
i
said
almost
stunned
at
the
suggestion
â€œwhyâ€
â€œoh
becauseâ€
she
said
womanlike
â€œi
can
see
it
in
your
face
it
tells
the
story
of
a
great
troubleâ€
â€œyes
everything
is
so
sadâ€
i
said
in
a
haphazard
way
which
i
had
intended
to
reflect
my
craziness
â€œbut
you
must
not
allow
that
to
worry
you
we
all
have
our
troubles
but
we
get
over
them
in
good
time
what
kind
of
work
are
you
trying
to
getâ€
â€œi
do
not
know
itâ€™s
all
so
sadâ€
i
replied
â€œwould
you
like
to
be
a
nurse
for
children
and
wear
a
nice
white
cap
and
apronâ€
she
asked
i
put
my
handkerchief
up
to
my
face
to
hide
a
smile
and
replied
in
a
muffled
tone
â€œi
never
worked
i
donâ€™t
know
howâ€
â€œbut
you
must
learnâ€
she
urged
â€œall
these
women
here
workâ€
â€œdo
theyâ€
i
said
in
a
low
thrilling
whisper
â€œwhy
they
look
horrible
to
me
just
like
crazy
women
i
am
so
afraid
of
themâ€
â€œthey
donâ€™t
look
very
niceâ€
she
answered
assentingly
â€œbut
they
are
good
honest
working
women
we
do
not
keep
crazy
people
hereâ€
i
again
used
my
handkerchief
to
hide
a
smile
as
i
thought
that
before
morning
she
would
at
least
think
she
had
one
crazy
person
among
her
flock
â€œthey
all
look
crazyâ€
i
asserted
again
â€œand
i
am
afraid
of
them
there
are
so
many
crazy
people
about
and
one
can
never
tell
what
they
will
do
then
there
are
so
many
murders
committed
and
the
police
never
catch
the
murderersâ€
and
i
finished
with
a
sob
that
would
have
broken
up
an
audience
of
blase
critics
she
gave
a
sudden
and
convulsive
start
and
i
knew
my
first
stroke
had
gone
home
it
was
amusing
to
see
what
a
remarkably
short
time
it
took
her
to
get
up
from
her
chair
and
to
whisper
hurriedly
â€œiâ€™ll
come
back
to
talk
with
you
after
awhileâ€
i
knew
she
would
not
come
back
and
she
did
not
when
the
supper-bell
rang
i
went
along
with
the
others
to
the
basement
and
partook
of
the
evening
meal
which
was
similar
to
dinner
except
that
there
was
a
smaller
bill
of
fare
and
more
people
the
women
who
are
employed
outside
during
the
day
having
returned
after
the
evening
meal
we
all
adjourned
to
the
parlors
where
all
sat
or
stood
as
there
were
not
chairs
enough
to
go
round
it
was
a
wretchedly
lonely
evening
and
the
light
which
fell
from
the
solitary
gas
jet
in
the
parlor
and
oil-lamp
in
the
hall
helped
to
envelop
us
in
a
dusky
hue
and
dye
our
spirits
a
navy
blue
i
felt
it
would
not
require
many
inundations
of
this
atmosphere
to
make
me
a
fit
subject
for
the
place
i
was
striving
to
reach
illustration
nellieâ€™s
first
meal
at
the
home
i
watched
two
women
who
seemed
of
all
the
crowd
to
be
the
most
sociable
and
i
selected
them
as
the
ones
to
work
out
my
salvation
or
more
properly
speaking
my
condemnation
and
conviction
excusing
myself
and
saying
that
i
felt
lonely
i
asked
if
i
might
join
their
company
they
graciously
consented
so
with
my
hat
and
gloves
on
which
no
one
had
asked
me
to
lay
aside
i
sat
down
and
listened
to
the
rather
wearisome
conversation
in
which
i
took
no
part
merely
keeping
up
my
sad
look
saying
â€œyesâ€
or
â€œnoâ€
or
â€œi
canâ€™t
sayâ€
to
their
observations
several
times
i
told
them
i
thought
everybody
in
the
house
looked
crazy
but
they
were
slow
to
catch
on
to
my
very
original
remark
one
said
her
name
was
mrs
king
and
that
she
was
a
southern
woman
then
she
said
that
i
had
a
southern
accent
she
asked
me
bluntly
if
i
did
not
really
come
from
the
south
i
said
â€œyesâ€
the
other
woman
got
to
talking
about
the
boston
boats
and
asked
me
if
i
knew
at
what
time
they
left
for
a
moment
i
forgot
my
role
of
assumed
insanity
and
told
her
the
correct
hour
of
departure
she
then
asked
me
what
work
i
was
going
to
do
or
if
i
had
ever
done
any
i
replied
that
i
thought
it
very
sad
that
there
were
so
many
working
people
in
the
world
she
said
in
reply
that
she
had
been
unfortunate
and
had
come
to
new
york
where
she
had
worked
at
correcting
proofs
on
a
medical
dictionary
for
some
time
but
that
her
health
had
given
way
under
the
task
and
that
she
was
now
going
to
boston
again
when
the
maid
came
to
tell
us
to
go
to
bed
i
remarked
that
i
was
afraid
and
again
ventured
the
assertion
that
all
the
women
in
the
house
seemed
to
be
crazy
the
nurse
insisted
on
my
going
to
bed
i
asked
if
i
could
not
sit
on
the
stairs
but
she
said
decisively
â€œno
for
every
one
in
the
house
would
think
you
were
crazyâ€
finally
i
allowed
them
to
take
me
to
a
room
here
i
must
introduce
a
new
personage
by
name
into
my
narrative
it
is
the
woman
who
had
been
a
proofreader
and
was
about
to
return
to
boston
she
was
a
mrs
caine
who
was
as
courageous
as
she
was
good-hearted
she
came
into
my
room
and
sat
and
talked
with
me
a
long
time
taking
down
my
hair
with
gentle
ways
she
tried
to
persuade
me
to
undress
and
go
to
bed
but
i
stubbornly
refused
to
do
so
during
this
time
a
number
of
the
inmates
of
the
house
had
gathered
around
us
they
expressed
themselves
in
various
ways
â€œpoor
loonâ€
they
said
â€œwhy
sheâ€™s
crazy
enoughâ€
â€œi
am
afraid
to
stay
with
such
a
crazy
being
in
the
houseâ€
â€œshe
will
murder
us
all
before
morningâ€
one
woman
was
for
sending
for
a
policeman
to
take
me
away
at
once
they
were
all
in
a
terrible
and
real
state
of
fright
no
one
wanted
to
be
responsible
for
me
and
the
woman
who
was
to
occupy
the
room
with
me
declared
that
she
would
not
stay
with
that
â€œcrazy
womanâ€
for
all
the
money
of
the
vanderbilts
it
was
then
that
mrs
caine
said
she
would
stay
with
me
i
told
her
i
would
like
to
have
her
do
so
so
she
was
left
with
me
she
didnâ€™t
undress
but
lay
down
on
the
bed
watchful
of
my
movements
she
tried
to
induce
me
to
lie
down
but
i
was
afraid
to
do
this
i
knew
that
if
i
once
gave
way
i
should
fall
asleep
and
dream
as
pleasantly
and
peacefully
as
a
child
i
should
to
use
a
slang
expression
be
liable
to
â€œgive
myself
dead
awayâ€
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
stay
awake
all
night
so
i
insisted
on
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
staring
blankly
at
vacancy
my
poor
companion
was
put
into
a
wretched
state
of
unhappiness
every
few
moments
she
would
rise
up
to
look
at
me
she
told
me
that
my
eyes
shone
terribly
brightly
and
then
began
to
question
me
asking
me
where
i
had
lived
how
long
i
had
been
in
new
york
what
i
had
been
doing
and
many
things
besides
to
all
her
questionings
i
had
but
one
responseâ€”i
told
her
that
i
had
forgotten
everything
that
ever
since
my
headache
had
come
on
i
could
not
remember
poor
soul
how
cruelly
i
tortured
her
and
what
a
kind
heart
she
had
but
how
i
tortured
all
of
them
one
of
them
dreamed
of
meâ€”as
a
nightmare
after
i
had
been
in
the
room
an
hour
or
so
i
was
myself
startled
by
hearing
a
woman
screaming
in
the
next
room
i
began
to
imagine
that
i
was
really
in
an
insane
asylum
mrs
caine
woke
up
looked
around
frightened
and
listened
she
then
went
out
and
into
the
next
room
and
i
heard
her
asking
another
woman
some
questions
when
she
came
back
she
told
me
that
the
woman
had
had
a
hideous
nightmare
she
had
been
dreaming
of
me
she
had
seen
me
she
said
rushing
at
her
with
a
knife
in
my
hand
with
the
intention
of
killing
her
in
trying
to
escape
me
she
had
fortunately
been
able
to
scream
and
so
to
awaken
herself
and
scare
off
her
nightmare
then
mrs
caine
got
into
bed
again
considerably
agitated
but
very
sleepy
i
was
weary
too
but
i
had
braced
myself
up
to
the
work
and
was
determined
to
keep
awake
all
night
so
as
to
carry
on
my
work
of
impersonation
to
a
successful
end
in
the
morning
i
heard
midnight
i
had
yet
six
hours
to
wait
for
daylight
the
time
passed
with
excruciating
slowness
minutes
appeared
hours
the
noises
in
the
house
and
on
the
avenue
ceased
fearing
that
sleep
would
coax
me
into
its
grasp
i
commenced
to
review
my
life
how
strange
it
all
seems
one
incident
if
never
so
trifling
is
but
a
link
more
to
chain
us
to
our
unchangeable
fate
i
began
at
the
beginning
and
lived
again
the
story
of
my
life
old
friends
were
recalled
with
a
pleasurable
thrill
old
enmities
old
heartaches
old
joys
were
once
again
present
the
turned-down
pages
of
my
life
were
turned
up
and
the
past
was
present
when
it
was
completed
i
turned
my
thoughts
bravely
to
the
future
wondering
first
what
the
next
day
would
bring
forth
then
making
plans
for
the
carrying
out
of
my
project
i
wondered
if
i
should
be
able
to
pass
over
the
river
to
the
goal
of
my
strange
ambition
to
become
eventually
an
inmate
of
the
halls
inhabited
by
my
mentally
wrecked
sisters
and
then
once
in
what
would
be
my
experience
and
after
how
to
get
out
bah
i
said
they
will
get
me
out
that
was
the
greatest
night
of
my
existence
for
a
few
hours
i
stood
face
to
face
with
â€œselfâ€
i
looked
out
toward
the
window
and
hailed
with
joy
the
slight
shimmer
of
dawn
the
light
grew
strong
and
gray
but
the
silence
was
strikingly
still
my
companion
slept
i
had
still
an
hour
or
two
to
pass
over
fortunately
i
found
some
employment
for
my
mental
activity
robert
bruce
in
his
captivity
had
won
confidence
in
the
future
and
passed
his
time
as
pleasantly
as
possible
under
the
circumstances
by
watching
the
celebrated
spider
building
his
web
i
had
less
noble
vermin
to
interest
me
yet
i
believe
i
made
some
valuable
discoveries
in
natural
history
i
was
about
dropping
off
to
sleep
in
spite
of
myself
when
i
was
suddenly
startled
to
wakefulness
i
thought
i
heard
something
crawl
and
fall
down
upon
the
counterpane
with
an
almost
inaudible
thud
i
had
the
opportunity
of
studying
these
interesting
animals
very
thoroughly
they
had
evidently
come
for
breakfast
and
were
not
a
little
disappointed
to
find
that
their
principal
plat
was
not
there
they
scampered
up
and
down
the
pillow
came
together
seemed
to
hold
interesting
converse
and
acted
in
every
way
as
if
they
were
puzzled
by
the
absence
of
an
appetizing
breakfast
after
one
consultation
of
some
length
they
finally
disappeared
seeking
victims
elsewhere
and
leaving
me
to
pass
the
long
minutes
by
giving
my
attention
to
cockroaches
whose
size
and
agility
were
something
of
a
surprise
to
me
my
room
companion
had
been
sound
asleep
for
a
long
time
but
she
now
woke
up
and
expressed
surprise
at
seeing
me
still
awake
and
apparently
as
lively
as
a
cricket
she
was
as
sympathetic
as
ever
she
came
to
me
and
took
my
hands
and
tried
her
best
to
console
me
and
asked
me
if
i
did
not
want
to
go
home
she
kept
me
up-stairs
until
nearly
everybody
was
out
of
the
house
and
then
took
me
down
to
the
basement
for
coffee
and
a
bun
after
that
partaken
in
silence
i
went
back
to
my
room
where
i
sat
down
moping
mrs
caine
grew
more
and
more
anxious
â€œwhat
is
to
be
doneâ€
she
kept
exclaiming
â€œwhere
are
your
friendsâ€
â€œnoâ€
i
answered
â€œi
have
no
friends
but
i
have
some
trunks
where
are
they
i
want
themâ€
the
good
woman
tried
to
pacify
me
saying
that
they
would
be
found
in
good
time
she
believed
that
i
was
insane
yet
i
forgive
her
it
is
only
after
one
is
in
trouble
that
one
realizes
how
little
sympathy
and
kindness
there
is
in
the
world
the
women
in
the
home
who
were
not
afraid
of
me
had
wanted
to
have
some
amusement
at
my
expense
and
so
they
had
bothered
me
with
questions
and
remarks
that
had
i
been
insane
would
have
been
cruel
and
inhumane
only
this
one
woman
among
the
crowd
pretty
and
delicate
mrs
caine
displayed
true
womanly
feeling
she
compelled
the
others
to
cease
teasing
me
and
took
the
bed
of
the
woman
who
refused
to
sleep
near
me
she
protested
against
the
suggestion
to
leave
me
alone
and
to
have
me
locked
up
for
the
night
so
that
i
could
harm
no
one
she
insisted
on
remaining
with
me
in
order
to
administer
aid
should
i
need
it
she
smoothed
my
hair
and
bathed
my
brow
and
talked
as
soothingly
to
me
as
a
mother
would
do
to
an
ailing
child
by
every
means
she
tried
to
have
me
go
to
bed
and
rest
and
when
it
drew
toward
morning
she
got
up
and
wrapped
a
blanket
around
me
for
fear
i
might
get
cold
then
she
kissed
me
on
the
brow
and
whispered
compassionately
â€œpoor
child
poor
childâ€
how
much
i
admired
that
little
womanâ€™s
courage
and
kindness
how
i
longed
to
reassure
her
and
whisper
that
i
was
not
insane
and
how
i
hoped
that
if
any
poor
girl
should
ever
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
what
i
was
pretending
to
be
she
might
meet
with
one
who
possessed
the
same
spirit
of
human
kindness
possessed
by
mrs
ruth
caine
judge
duffy
and
the
police
but
to
return
to
my
story
i
kept
up
my
role
until
the
assistant
matron
mrs
stanard
came
in
she
tried
to
persuade
me
to
be
calm
i
began
to
see
clearly
that
she
wanted
to
get
me
out
of
the
house
at
all
hazards
quietly
if
possible
this
i
did
not
want
i
refused
to
move
but
kept
up
ever
the
refrain
of
my
lost
trunks
finally
some
one
suggested
that
an
officer
be
sent
for
after
awhile
mrs
stanard
put
on
her
bonnet
and
went
out
then
i
knew
that
i
was
making
an
advance
toward
the
home
of
the
insane
soon
she
returned
bringing
with
her
two
policemenâ€”big
strong
menâ€”who
entered
the
room
rather
unceremoniously
evidently
expecting
to
meet
with
a
person
violently
crazy
the
name
of
one
of
them
was
tom
bockert
when
they
entered
i
pretended
not
to
see
them
â€œi
want
you
to
take
her
quietlyâ€
said
mrs
stanard
â€œif
she
donâ€™t
come
along
quietlyâ€
responded
one
of
the
men
â€œi
will
drag
her
through
the
streetsâ€
i
still
took
no
notice
of
them
but
certainly
wished
to
avoid
raising
a
scandal
outside
fortunately
mrs
caine
came
to
my
rescue
she
told
the
officers
about
my
outcries
for
my
lost
trunks
and
together
they
made
up
a
plan
to
get
me
to
go
along
with
them
quietly
by
telling
me
they
would
go
with
me
to
look
for
my
lost
effects
they
asked
me
if
i
would
go
i
said
i
was
afraid
to
go
alone
mrs
stanard
then
said
she
would
accompany
me
and
she
arranged
that
the
two
policemen
should
follow
us
at
a
respectful
distance
she
tied
on
my
veil
for
me
and
we
left
the
house
by
the
basement
and
started
across
town
the
two
officers
following
at
some
distance
behind
we
walked
along
very
quietly
and
finally
came
to
the
station-house
which
the
good
woman
assured
me
was
the
express
office
and
that
there
we
should
certainly
find
my
missing
effects
i
went
inside
with
fear
and
trembling
for
good
reason
a
few
days
previous
to
this
i
had
met
captain
mccullagh
at
a
meeting
held
in
cooper
union
at
that
time
i
had
asked
him
for
some
information
which
he
had
given
me
if
he
were
in
would
he
not
recognize
me
and
then
all
would
be
lost
so
far
as
getting
to
the
island
was
concerned
i
pulled
my
sailor
hat
as
low
down
over
my
face
as
i
possibly
could
and
prepared
for
the
ordeal
sure
enough
there
was
sturdy
captain
mccullagh
standing
near
the
desk
he
watched
me
closely
as
the
officer
at
the
desk
conversed
in
a
low
tone
with
mrs
stanard
and
the
policeman
who
brought
me
â€œare
you
nellie
brownâ€
asked
the
officer
i
said
i
supposed
i
was
â€œwhere
do
you
come
fromâ€
he
asked
i
told
him
i
did
not
know
and
then
mrs
stanard
gave
him
a
lot
of
information
about
meâ€”told
him
how
strangely
i
had
acted
at
her
home
how
i
had
not
slept
a
wink
all
night
and
that
in
her
opinion
i
was
a
poor
unfortunate
who
had
been
driven
crazy
by
inhuman
treatment
there
was
some
discussion
between
mrs
stanard
and
the
two
officers
and
tom
bockert
was
told
to
take
us
down
to
the
court
in
a
car
illustration
in
the
hands
of
the
police
â€œcome
alongâ€
bockert
said
â€œi
will
find
your
trunk
for
youâ€
we
all
went
together
mrs
stanard
tom
bockert
and
myself
i
said
it
was
very
kind
of
them
to
go
with
me
and
i
should
not
soon
forget
them
as
we
walked
along
i
kept
up
my
refrain
about
my
trunks
interjecting
occasionally
some
remark
about
the
dirty
condition
of
the
streets
and
the
curious
character
of
the
people
we
met
on
the
way
â€œi
donâ€™t
think
i
have
ever
seen
such
people
beforeâ€
i
said
â€œwho
are
theyâ€
i
asked
and
my
companions
looked
upon
me
with
expressions
of
pity
evidently
believing
i
was
a
foreigner
an
immigrant
or
something
of
the
sort
they
told
me
that
the
people
around
me
were
working
people
i
remarked
once
more
that
i
thought
there
were
too
many
working
people
in
the
world
for
the
amount
of
work
to
be
done
at
which
remark
policeman
p
t
bockert
eyed
me
closely
evidently
thinking
that
my
mind
was
gone
for
good
we
passed
several
other
policemen
who
generally
asked
my
sturdy
guardians
what
was
the
matter
with
me
by
this
time
quite
a
number
of
ragged
children
were
following
us
too
and
they
passed
remarks
about
me
that
were
to
me
original
as
well
as
amusing
â€œwhatâ€™s
she
up
forâ€
â€œsay
kop
where
did
ye
get
herâ€
â€œwhere
did
yer
pull
â€™erâ€
â€œsheâ€™s
a
daisyâ€
poor
mrs
stanard
was
more
frightened
than
i
was
the
whole
situation
grew
interesting
but
i
still
had
fears
for
my
fate
before
the
judge
at
last
we
came
to
a
low
building
and
tom
bockert
kindly
volunteered
the
information
â€œhereâ€™s
the
express
office
we
shall
soon
find
those
trunks
of
yoursâ€
the
entrance
to
the
building
was
surrounded
by
a
curious
crowd
and
i
did
not
think
my
case
was
bad
enough
to
permit
me
passing
them
without
some
remark
so
i
asked
if
all
those
people
had
lost
their
trunks
â€œyesâ€
he
said
â€œnearly
all
these
people
are
looking
for
trunksâ€
i
said
â€œthey
all
seem
to
be
foreigners
tooâ€
â€œyesâ€
said
tom
â€œthey
are
all
foreigners
just
landed
they
have
all
lost
their
trunks
and
it
takes
most
of
our
time
to
help
find
them
for
themâ€
we
entered
the
courtroom
it
was
the
essex
market
police
courtroom
at
last
the
question
of
my
sanity
or
insanity
was
to
be
decided
judge
duffy
sat
behind
the
high
desk
wearing
a
look
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
was
dealing
out
the
milk
of
human
kindness
by
wholesale
i
rather
feared
i
would
not
get
the
fate
i
sought
because
of
the
kindness
i
saw
on
every
line
of
his
face
and
it
was
with
rather
a
sinking
heart
that
i
followed
mrs
stanard
as
she
answered
the
summons
to
go
up
to
the
desk
where
tom
bockert
had
just
given
an
account
of
the
affair
â€œcome
hereâ€
said
an
officer
â€œwhat
is
your
nameâ€
â€œnellie
brownâ€
i
replied
with
a
little
accent
â€œi
have
lost
my
trunks
and
would
like
if
you
could
find
themâ€
â€œwhen
did
you
come
to
new
yorkâ€
he
asked
â€œi
did
not
come
to
new
yorkâ€
i
replied
while
i
added
mentally
â€œbecause
i
have
been
here
for
some
timeâ€
â€œbut
you
are
in
new
york
nowâ€
said
the
man
â€œnoâ€
i
said
looking
as
incredulous
as
i
thought
a
crazy
person
could
â€œi
did
not
come
to
new
yorkâ€
â€œthat
girl
is
from
the
westâ€
he
said
in
a
tone
that
made
me
tremble
â€œshe
has
a
western
accentâ€
some
one
else
who
had
been
listening
to
the
brief
dialogue
here
asserted
that
he
had
lived
south
and
that
my
accent
was
southern
while
another
officer
was
positive
it
was
eastern
i
felt
much
relieved
when
the
first
spokesman
turned
to
the
judge
and
said
â€œjudge
here
is
a
peculiar
case
of
a
young
woman
who
doesnâ€™t
know
who
she
is
or
where
she
came
from
you
had
better
attend
to
it
at
onceâ€
i
commenced
to
shake
with
more
than
the
cold
and
i
looked
around
at
the
strange
crowd
about
me
composed
of
poorly
dressed
men
and
women
with
stories
printed
on
their
faces
of
hard
lives
abuse
and
poverty
some
were
consulting
eagerly
with
friends
while
others
sat
still
with
a
look
of
utter
hopelessness
everywhere
was
a
sprinkling
of
well-dressed
well-fed
officers
watching
the
scene
passively
and
almost
indifferently
it
was
only
an
old
story
with
them
one
more
unfortunate
added
to
a
long
list
which
had
long
since
ceased
to
be
of
any
interest
or
concern
to
them
illustration
nellie
before
judge
duffy
â€œcome
here
girl
and
lift
your
veilâ€
called
out
judge
duffy
in
tones
which
surprised
me
by
a
harshness
which
i
did
not
think
from
the
kindly
face
he
possessed
â€œwho
are
you
speaking
toâ€
i
inquired
in
my
stateliest
manner
â€œcome
here
my
dear
and
lift
your
veil
you
know
the
queen
of
england
if
she
were
here
would
have
to
lift
her
veilâ€
he
said
very
kindly
â€œthat
is
much
betterâ€
i
replied
â€œi
am
not
the
queen
of
england
but
iâ€™ll
lift
my
veilâ€
as
i
did
so
the
little
judge
looked
at
me
and
then
in
a
very
kind
and
gentle
tone
he
said
â€œmy
dear
child
what
is
wrongâ€
â€œnothing
is
wrong
except
that
i
have
lost
my
trunks
and
this
manâ€
indicating
policeman
bockert
â€œpromised
to
bring
me
where
they
could
be
foundâ€
â€œwhat
do
you
know
about
this
childâ€
asked
the
judge
sternly
of
mrs
stanard
who
stood
pale
and
trembling
by
my
side
â€œi
know
nothing
of
her
except
that
she
came
to
the
home
yesterday
and
asked
to
remain
overnightâ€
â€œthe
home
what
do
you
mean
by
the
homeâ€
asked
judge
duffy
quickly
â€œit
is
a
temporary
home
kept
for
working
women
at
no
84
second
avenueâ€
â€œwhat
is
your
position
thereâ€
â€œi
am
assistant
matronâ€
â€œwell
tell
us
all
you
know
of
the
caseâ€
â€œwhen
i
was
going
into
the
home
yesterday
i
noticed
her
coming
down
the
avenue
she
was
all
alone
i
had
just
got
into
the
house
when
the
bell
rang
and
she
came
in
when
i
talked
with
her
she
wanted
to
know
if
she
could
stay
all
night
and
i
said
she
could
after
awhile
she
said
all
the
people
in
the
house
looked
crazy
and
she
was
afraid
of
them
then
she
would
not
go
to
bed
but
sat
up
all
the
nightâ€
â€œhad
she
any
moneyâ€
â€œyesâ€
i
replied
answering
for
her
â€œi
paid
her
for
everything
and
the
eating
was
the
worst
i
ever
triedâ€
there
was
a
general
smile
at
this
and
some
murmurs
of
â€œsheâ€™s
not
so
crazy
on
the
food
questionâ€
â€œpoor
childâ€
said
judge
duffy
â€œshe
is
well
dressed
and
a
lady
her
english
is
perfect
and
i
would
stake
everything
on
her
being
a
good
girl
i
am
positive
she
is
somebodyâ€™s
darlingâ€
at
this
announcement
everybody
laughed
and
i
put
my
handkerchief
over
my
face
and
endeavored
to
choke
the
laughter
that
threatened
to
spoil
my
plans
in
despite
of
my
resolutions
â€œi
mean
she
is
some
womanâ€™s
darlingâ€
hastily
amended
the
judge
â€œi
am
sure
some
one
is
searching
for
her
poor
girl
i
will
be
good
to
her
for
she
looks
like
my
sister
who
is
deadâ€
there
was
a
hush
for
a
moment
after
this
announcement
and
the
officers
glanced
at
me
more
kindly
while
i
silently
blessed
the
kind-hearted
judge
and
hoped
that
any
poor
creatures
who
might
be
afflicted
as
i
pretended
to
be
should
have
as
kindly
a
man
to
deal
with
as
judge
duffy
â€œi
wish
the
reporters
were
hereâ€
he
said
at
last
â€œthey
would
be
able
to
find
out
something
about
herâ€
i
got
very
much
frightened
at
this
for
if
there
is
any
one
who
can
ferret
out
a
mystery
it
is
a
reporter
i
felt
that
i
would
rather
face
a
mass
of
expert
doctors
policemen
and
detectives
than
two
bright
specimens
of
my
craft
so
i
said
â€œi
donâ€™t
see
why
all
this
is
needed
to
help
me
find
my
trunks
these
men
are
impudent
and
i
do
not
want
to
be
stared
at
i
will
go
away
i
donâ€™t
want
to
stay
hereâ€
so
saying
i
pulled
down
my
veil
and
secretly
hoped
the
reporters
would
be
detained
elsewhere
until
i
was
sent
to
the
asylum
â€œi
donâ€™t
know
what
to
do
with
the
poor
childâ€
said
the
worried
judge
â€œshe
must
be
taken
care
ofâ€
â€œsend
her
to
the
islandâ€
suggested
one
of
the
officers
â€œoh
donâ€™tâ€
said
mrs
stanard
in
evident
alarm
â€œdonâ€™t
she
is
a
lady
and
it
would
kill
her
to
be
put
on
the
islandâ€
for
once
i
felt
like
shaking
that
good
woman
to
think
the
island
was
just
the
place
i
wanted
to
reach
and
here
she
was
trying
to
keep
me
from
going
there
it
was
very
kind
of
her
but
rather
provoking
under
the
circumstances
â€œthere
has
been
some
foul
work
hereâ€
said
the
judge
â€œi
believe
this
child
has
been
drugged
and
brought
to
this
city
make
out
the
papers
and
we
will
send
her
to
bellevue
for
examination
probably
in
a
few
days
the
effect
of
the
drug
will
pass
off
and
she
will
be
able
to
tell
us
a
story
that
will
be
startling
if
the
reporters
would
only
comeâ€
i
dreaded
them
so
i
said
something
about
not
wishing
to
stay
there
any
longer
to
be
gazed
at
judge
duffy
then
told
policeman
bockert
to
take
me
to
the
back
office
after
we
were
seated
there
judge
duffy
came
in
and
asked
me
if
my
home
was
in
cuba
â€œyesâ€
i
replied
with
a
smile
â€œhow
did
you
knowâ€
â€œoh
i
knew
it
my
dear
now
tell
me
where
was
it
in
what
part
of
cubaâ€
â€œon
the
haciendaâ€
i
replied
â€œahâ€
said
the
judge
â€œon
a
farm
do
you
remember
havanaâ€
â€œsi
senorâ€
i
answered
â€œit
is
near
home
how
did
you
knowâ€
â€œoh
i
knew
all
about
it
now
wonâ€™t
you
tell
me
the
name
of
your
homeâ€
he
asked
persuasively
â€œthatâ€™s
what
i
forgetâ€
i
answered
sadly
â€œi
have
a
headache
all
the
time
and
it
makes
me
forget
things
i
donâ€™t
want
them
to
trouble
me
everybody
is
asking
me
questions
and
it
makes
my
head
worseâ€
and
in
truth
it
did
â€œwell
no
one
shall
trouble
you
any
more
sit
down
here
and
rest
awhileâ€
and
the
genial
judge
left
me
alone
with
mrs
stanard
just
then
an
officer
came
in
with
a
reporter
i
was
so
frightened
and
thought
i
would
be
recognized
as
a
journalist
so
i
turned
my
head
away
and
said
â€œi
donâ€™t
want
to
see
any
reporters
i
will
not
see
any
the
judge
said
i
was
not
to
be
troubledâ€
â€œwell
there
is
no
insanity
in
thatâ€
said
the
man
who
had
brought
the
reporter
and
together
they
left
the
room
once
again
i
had
a
fit
of
fear
had
i
gone
too
far
in
not
wanting
to
see
a
reporter
and
was
my
sanity
detected
if
i
had
given
the
impression
that
i
was
sane
i
was
determined
to
undo
it
so
i
jumped
up
and
ran
back
and
forward
through
the
office
mrs
stanard
clinging
terrified
to
my
arm
â€œi
wonâ€™t
stay
here
i
want
my
trunks
why
do
they
bother
me
with
so
many
peopleâ€
and
thus
i
kept
on
until
the
ambulance
surgeon
came
in
accompanied
by
the
judge
pronounced
insane
â€œhere
is
a
poor
girl
who
has
been
druggedâ€
explained
the
judge
â€œshe
looks
like
my
sister
and
any
one
can
see
she
is
a
good
girl
i
am
interested
in
the
child
and
i
would
do
as
much
for
her
as
if
she
were
my
own
i
want
you
to
be
kind
to
herâ€
he
said
to
the
ambulance
surgeon
then
turning
to
mrs
stanard
he
asked
her
if
she
could
not
keep
me
for
a
few
days
until
my
case
was
inquired
into
fortunately
she
said
she
could
not
because
all
the
women
at
the
home
were
afraid
of
me
and
would
leave
if
i
were
kept
there
i
was
very
much
afraid
she
would
keep
me
if
the
pay
was
assured
her
and
so
i
said
something
about
the
bad
cooking
and
that
i
did
not
intend
to
go
back
to
the
home
then
came
the
examination
the
doctor
looked
clever
and
i
had
not
one
hope
of
deceiving
him
but
i
determined
to
keep
up
the
farce
â€œput
out
your
tongueâ€
he
ordered
briskly
i
gave
an
inward
chuckle
at
the
thought
â€œput
out
your
tongue
when
i
tell
youâ€
he
said
â€œi
donâ€™t
want
toâ€
i
answered
truthfully
enough
â€œyou
must
you
are
sick
and
i
am
a
doctorâ€
â€œi
am
not
sick
and
never
was
i
only
want
my
trunksâ€
but
i
put
out
my
tongue
which
he
looked
at
in
a
sagacious
manner
then
he
felt
my
pulse
and
listened
to
the
beating
of
my
heart
i
had
not
the
least
idea
how
the
heart
of
an
insane
person
beat
so
i
held
my
breath
all
the
while
he
listened
until
when
he
quit
i
had
to
give
a
gasp
to
regain
it
then
he
tried
the
effect
of
the
light
on
the
pupils
of
my
eyes
holding
his
hand
within
a
half
inch
of
my
face
he
told
me
to
look
at
it
then
jerking
it
hastily
away
he
would
examine
my
eyes
i
was
puzzled
to
know
what
insanity
was
like
in
the
eye
so
i
thought
the
best
thing
under
the
circumstances
was
to
stare
this
i
did
i
held
my
eyes
riveted
unblinkingly
upon
his
hand
and
when
he
removed
it
i
exerted
all
my
strength
to
still
keep
my
eyes
from
blinking
illustration
an
insanity
expert
at
work
â€œwhat
drugs
have
you
been
takingâ€
he
then
asked
me
â€œdrugsâ€
i
repeated
wonderingly
â€œi
do
not
know
what
drugs
areâ€
â€œthe
pupils
of
her
eyes
have
been
enlarged
ever
since
she
came
to
the
home
they
have
not
changed
onceâ€
explained
mrs
stanard
i
wondered
how
she
knew
whether
they
had
or
not
but
i
kept
quiet
â€œi
believe
she
has
been
using
belladonnaâ€
said
the
doctor
and
for
the
first
time
i
was
thankful
that
i
was
a
little
near-sighted
which
of
course
answers
for
the
enlargement
of
the
pupils
i
thought
i
might
as
well
be
truthful
when
i
could
without
injuring
my
case
so
i
told
him
i
was
near-sighted
that
i
was
not
in
the
least
ill
had
never
been
sick
and
that
no
one
had
a
right
to
detain
me
when
i
wanted
to
find
my
trunks
i
wanted
to
go
home
he
wrote
a
lot
of
things
in
a
long
slender
book
and
then
said
he
was
going
to
take
me
home
the
judge
told
him
to
take
me
and
to
be
kind
to
me
and
to
tell
the
people
at
the
hospital
to
be
kind
to
me
and
to
do
all
they
could
for
me
if
we
only
had
more
such
men
as
judge
duffy
the
poor
unfortunates
would
not
find
life
all
darkness
i
began
to
have
more
confidence
in
my
own
ability
now
since
one
judge
one
doctor
and
a
mass
of
people
had
pronounced
me
insane
and
i
put
on
my
veil
quite
gladly
when
i
was
told
that
i
was
to
be
taken
in
a
carriage
and
that
afterward
i
could
go
home
â€œi
am
so
glad
to
go
with
youâ€
i
said
and
i
meant
it
i
was
very
glad
indeed
once
more
guarded
by
policeman
brockert
i
walked
through
the
little
crowded
courtroom
i
felt
quite
proud
of
myself
as
i
went
out
a
side
door
into
an
alleyway
where
the
ambulance
was
waiting
near
the
closed
and
barred
gates
was
a
small
office
occupied
by
several
men
and
large
books
we
all
went
in
there
and
when
they
began
to
ask
me
questions
the
doctor
interposed
and
said
he
had
all
the
papers
and
that
it
was
useless
to
ask
me
anything
further
because
i
was
unable
to
answer
questions
this
was
a
great
relief
to
me
for
my
nerves
were
already
feeling
the
strain
a
rough-looking
man
wanted
to
put
me
into
the
ambulance
but
i
refused
his
aid
so
decidedly
that
the
doctor
and
policeman
told
him
to
desist
and
they
performed
that
gallant
office
themselves
i
did
not
enter
the
ambulance
without
protest
i
made
the
remark
that
i
had
never
seen
a
carriage
of
that
make
before
and
that
i
did
not
want
to
ride
in
it
but
after
awhile
i
let
them
persuade
me
as
i
had
right
along
intended
to
do
i
shall
never
forget
that
ride
after
i
was
put
in
flat
on
the
yellow
blanket
the
doctor
got
in
and
sat
near
the
door
the
large
gates
were
swung
open
and
the
curious
crowd
which
had
collected
swayed
back
to
make
way
for
the
ambulance
as
it
backed
out
how
they
tried
to
get
a
glimpse
at
the
supposed
crazy
girl
the
doctor
saw
that
i
did
not
like
the
people
gazing
at
me
and
considerately
put
down
the
curtains
after
asking
my
wishes
in
regard
to
it
still
that
did
not
keep
the
people
away
the
children
raced
after
us
yelling
all
sorts
of
slang
expressions
and
trying
to
get
a
peep
under
the
curtains
it
was
quite
an
interesting
drive
but
i
must
say
that
it
was
an
excruciatingly
rough
one
i
held
on
only
there
was
not
much
to
hold
on
to
and
the
driver
drove
as
if
he
feared
some
one
would
catch
up
with
us
in
bellevue
hospital
at
last
bellevue
was
reached
the
third
station
on
my
way
to
the
island
i
had
passed
through
successfully
the
ordeals
at
the
home
and
at
essex
market
police
court
and
now
felt
confident
that
i
should
not
fail
the
ambulance
stopped
with
a
sudden
jerk
and
the
doctor
jumped
out
â€œhow
many
have
youâ€
i
heard
some
one
inquire
â€œonly
one
for
the
pavilionâ€
was
the
reply
a
rough-looking
man
came
forward
and
catching
hold
of
me
attempted
to
drag
me
out
as
if
i
had
the
strength
of
an
elephant
and
would
resist
the
doctor
seeing
my
look
of
disgust
ordered
him
to
leave
me
alone
saying
that
he
would
take
charge
of
me
himself
he
then
lifted
me
carefully
out
and
i
walked
with
the
grace
of
a
queen
past
the
crowd
that
had
gathered
curious
to
see
the
new
unfortunate
together
with
the
doctor
i
entered
a
small
dark
office
where
there
were
several
men
the
one
behind
the
desk
opened
a
book
and
began
on
the
long
string
of
questions
which
had
been
asked
me
so
often
i
refused
to
answer
and
the
doctor
told
him
it
was
not
necessary
to
trouble
me
further
as
he
had
all
the
papers
made
out
and
i
was
too
insane
to
be
able
to
tell
anything
that
would
be
of
consequence
i
felt
relieved
that
it
was
so
easy
here
as
though
still
undaunted
i
had
begun
to
feel
faint
for
want
of
food
the
order
was
then
given
to
take
me
to
the
insane
pavilion
and
a
muscular
man
came
forward
and
caught
me
so
tightly
by
the
arm
that
a
pain
ran
clear
through
me
it
made
me
angry
and
for
a
moment
i
forgot
my
role
as
i
turned
to
him
and
said
â€œhow
dare
you
touch
meâ€
at
this
he
loosened
his
hold
somewhat
and
i
shook
him
off
with
more
strength
than
i
thought
i
possessed
â€œi
will
go
with
no
one
but
this
manâ€
i
said
pointing
to
the
ambulance-surgeon
â€œthe
judge
said
that
he
was
to
take
care
of
me
and
i
will
go
with
no
one
elseâ€
at
this
the
surgeon
said
that
he
would
take
me
and
so
we
went
arm
in
arm
following
the
man
who
had
at
first
been
so
rough
with
me
we
passed
through
the
well-cared-for
grounds
and
finally
reached
the
insane
ward
a
white-capped
nurse
was
there
to
receive
me
â€œthis
young
girl
is
to
wait
here
for
the
boatâ€
said
the
surgeon
and
then
he
started
to
leave
me
i
begged
him
not
to
go
or
to
take
me
with
him
but
he
said
he
wanted
to
get
his
dinner
first
and
that
i
should
wait
there
for
him
when
i
insisted
on
accompanying
him
he
claimed
that
he
had
to
assist
at
an
amputation
and
it
would
not
look
well
for
me
to
be
present
it
was
evident
that
he
believed
he
was
dealing
with
an
insane
person
just
then
the
most
horrible
insane
cries
came
from
a
yard
in
the
rear
with
all
my
bravery
i
felt
a
chill
at
the
prospect
of
being
shut
up
with
a
fellow-creature
who
was
really
insane
the
doctor
evidently
noticed
my
nervousness
for
he
said
to
the
attendant
â€œwhat
a
noise
the
carpenters
makeâ€
turning
to
me
he
offered
me
explanation
to
the
effect
that
new
buildings
were
being
erected
and
that
the
noise
came
from
some
of
the
workmen
engaged
upon
it
i
told
him
i
did
not
want
to
stay
there
without
him
and
to
pacify
me
he
promised
soon
to
return
he
left
me
and
i
found
myself
at
last
an
occupant
of
an
insane
asylum
i
stood
at
the
door
and
contemplated
the
scene
before
me
the
long
uncarpeted
hall
was
scrubbed
to
that
peculiar
whiteness
seen
only
in
public
institutions
in
the
rear
of
the
hall
were
large
iron
doors
fastened
by
a
padlock
several
stiff-looking
benches
and
a
number
of
willow
chairs
were
the
only
articles
of
furniture
on
either
side
of
the
hall
were
doors
leading
into
what
i
supposed
and
what
proved
to
be
bedrooms
near
the
entrance
door
on
the
right-hand
side
was
a
small
sitting-room
for
the
nurses
and
opposite
it
was
a
room
where
dinner
was
dished
out
a
nurse
in
a
black
dress
white
cap
and
apron
and
armed
with
a
bunch
of
keys
had
charge
of
the
hall
i
soon
learned
her
name
miss
ball
an
old
irishwoman
was
maid-of-all-work
i
heard
her
called
mary
and
i
am
glad
to
know
that
there
is
such
a
good-hearted
woman
in
that
place
i
experienced
only
kindness
and
the
utmost
consideration
from
her
there
were
only
three
patients
as
they
are
called
i
made
the
fourth
i
thought
i
might
as
well
begin
work
at
once
for
i
still
expected
that
the
very
first
doctor
might
declare
me
sane
and
send
me
out
again
into
the
wide
wide
world
so
i
went
down
to
the
rear
of
the
room
and
introduced
myself
to
one
of
the
women
and
asked
her
all
about
herself
her
name
she
said
was
miss
anne
neville
and
she
had
been
sick
from
overwork
she
had
been
working
as
a
chambermaid
and
when
her
health
gave
way
she
was
sent
to
some
sistersâ€™
home
to
be
treated
her
nephew
who
was
a
waiter
was
out
of
work
and
being
unable
to
pay
her
expenses
at
the
home
had
had
her
transferred
to
bellevue
â€œis
there
anything
wrong
with
you
mentally
as
wellâ€
i
asked
her
â€œnoâ€
she
said
â€œthe
doctors
have
been
asking
me
many
curious
questions
and
confusing
me
as
much
as
possible
but
i
have
nothing
wrong
with
my
brainâ€
â€œdo
you
know
that
only
insane
people
are
sent
to
this
pavilionâ€
i
asked
â€œyes
i
know
but
i
am
unable
to
do
anything
the
doctors
refuse
to
listen
to
me
and
it
is
useless
to
say
anything
to
the
nursesâ€
satisfied
from
various
reasons
that
miss
neville
was
as
sane
as
i
was
myself
i
transferred
my
attentions
to
one
of
the
other
patients
i
found
her
in
need
of
medical
aid
and
quite
silly
mentally
although
i
have
seen
many
women
in
the
lower
walks
of
life
whose
sanity
was
never
questioned
who
were
not
any
brighter
the
third
patient
mrs
fox
would
not
say
much
she
was
very
quiet
and
after
telling
me
that
her
case
was
hopeless
refused
to
talk
i
began
now
to
feel
surer
of
my
position
and
i
determined
that
no
doctor
should
convince
me
that
i
was
sane
so
long
as
i
had
the
hope
of
accomplishing
my
mission
a
small
fair-complexioned
nurse
arrived
and
after
putting
on
her
cap
told
miss
ball
to
go
to
dinner
the
new
nurse
miss
scott
by
name
came
to
me
and
said
rudely
â€œtake
off
your
hatâ€
â€œi
shall
not
take
off
my
hatâ€
i
answered
â€œi
am
waiting
for
the
boat
and
i
shall
not
remove
itâ€
â€œwell
you
are
not
going
on
any
boat
you
might
as
well
know
it
now
as
later
you
are
in
an
asylum
for
the
insaneâ€
although
fully
aware
of
that
fact
her
unvarnished
words
gave
me
a
shock
â€œi
did
not
want
to
come
here
i
am
not
sick
or
insane
and
i
will
not
stayâ€
i
said
â€œit
will
be
a
long
time
before
you
get
out
if
you
donâ€™t
do
as
you
are
toldâ€
answered
miss
scott
â€œyou
might
as
well
take
off
your
hat
or
i
shall
use
force
and
if
i
am
not
able
to
do
it
i
have
but
to
touch
a
bell
and
i
shall
get
assistance
will
you
take
it
offâ€
â€œno
i
will
not
i
am
cold
and
i
want
my
hat
on
and
you
canâ€™t
make
me
take
it
offâ€
â€œi
shall
give
you
a
few
more
minutes
and
if
you
donâ€™t
take
it
off
then
i
shall
use
force
and
i
warn
you
it
will
not
be
very
gentleâ€
â€œif
you
take
my
hat
off
i
shall
take
your
cap
off
so
nowâ€
miss
scott
was
called
to
the
door
then
and
as
i
feared
that
an
exhibition
of
temper
might
show
too
much
sanity
i
took
off
my
hat
and
gloves
and
was
sitting
quietly
looking
into
space
when
she
returned
i
was
hungry
and
was
quite
pleased
to
see
mary
make
preparations
for
dinner
the
preparations
were
simple
she
merely
pulled
a
straight
bench
up
along
the
side
of
a
bare
table
and
ordered
the
patients
to
gather
â€™round
the
feast
then
she
brought
out
a
small
tin
plate
on
which
was
a
piece
of
boiled
meat
and
a
potato
it
could
not
have
been
colder
had
it
been
cooked
the
week
before
and
it
had
no
chance
to
make
acquaintance
with
salt
or
pepper
i
would
not
go
up
to
the
table
so
mary
came
to
where
i
sat
in
a
corner
and
while
handing
out
the
tin
plate
asked
â€œhave
ye
any
pennies
about
ye
dearieâ€
â€œwhatâ€
i
said
in
my
surprise
â€œhave
ye
any
pennies
dearie
that
ye
could
give
me
theyâ€™ll
take
them
all
from
ye
any
way
dearie
so
i
might
as
well
have
themâ€
i
understood
it
fully
now
but
i
had
no
intention
of
feeing
mary
so
early
in
the
game
fearing
it
would
have
an
influence
on
her
treatment
of
me
so
i
said
i
had
lost
my
purse
which
was
quite
true
but
though
i
did
not
give
mary
any
money
she
was
none
the
less
kind
to
me
when
i
objected
to
the
tin
plate
in
which
she
had
brought
my
food
she
fetched
a
china
one
for
me
and
when
i
found
it
impossible
to
eat
the
food
she
presented
she
gave
me
a
glass
of
milk
and
a
soda
cracker
all
the
windows
in
the
hall
were
open
and
the
cold
air
began
to
tell
on
my
southern
blood
it
grew
so
cold
indeed
as
to
be
almost
unbearable
and
i
complained
of
it
to
miss
scott
and
miss
ball
but
they
answered
curtly
that
as
i
was
in
a
charity
place
i
could
not
expect
much
else
all
the
other
women
were
suffering
from
the
cold
and
the
nurses
themselves
had
to
wear
heavy
garments
to
keep
themselves
warm
i
asked
if
i
could
go
to
bed
they
said
â€œnoâ€
at
last
miss
scott
got
an
old
gray
shawl
and
shaking
some
of
the
moths
out
of
it
told
me
to
put
it
on
â€œitâ€™s
rather
a
bad-looking
shawlâ€
i
said
â€œwell
some
people
would
get
along
better
if
they
were
not
so
proudâ€
said
miss
scott
â€œpeople
on
charity
should
not
expect
anything
and
should
not
complainâ€
so
i
put
the
moth-eaten
shawl
with
all
its
musty
smell
around
me
and
sat
down
on
a
wicker
chair
wondering
what
would
come
next
whether
i
should
freeze
to
death
or
survive
my
nose
was
very
cold
so
i
covered
up
my
head
and
was
in
a
half
doze
when
the
shawl
was
suddenly
jerked
from
my
face
and
a
strange
man
and
miss
scott
stood
before
me
the
man
proved
to
be
a
doctor
and
his
first
greetings
were
â€œiâ€™ve
seen
that
face
beforeâ€
â€œthen
you
know
meâ€
i
asked
with
a
great
show
of
eagerness
that
i
did
not
feel
â€œi
think
i
do
where
did
you
come
fromâ€
â€œfrom
homeâ€
â€œwhere
is
homeâ€
â€œdonâ€™t
you
know
cubaâ€
illustration
positively
demented
he
then
sat
down
beside
me
felt
my
pulse
and
examined
my
tongue
and
at
last
said
â€œtell
miss
scott
all
about
yourselfâ€
â€œno
i
will
not
i
will
not
talk
with
womenâ€
â€œwhat
do
you
do
in
new
yorkâ€
â€œnothingâ€
â€œcan
you
workâ€
â€œno
senorâ€
â€œtell
me
are
you
a
woman
of
the
townâ€
â€œi
do
not
understand
youâ€
i
replied
heartily
disgusted
with
him
â€œi
mean
have
you
allowed
the
men
to
provide
for
you
and
keep
youâ€
i
felt
like
slapping
him
in
the
face
but
i
had
to
maintain
my
composure
so
i
simply
said
â€œi
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
always
lived
at
homeâ€
after
many
more
questions
fully
as
useless
and
senseless
he
left
me
and
began
to
talk
with
the
nurse
â€œpositively
dementedâ€
he
said
â€œi
consider
it
a
hopeless
case
she
needs
to
be
put
where
some
one
will
take
care
of
herâ€
and
so
i
passed
my
second
medical
expert
after
this
i
began
to
have
a
smaller
regard
for
the
ability
of
doctors
than
i
ever
had
before
and
a
greater
one
for
myself
i
felt
sure
now
that
no
doctor
could
tell
whether
people
were
insane
or
not
so
long
as
the
case
was
not
violent
later
in
the
afternoon
a
boy
and
a
woman
came
the
woman
sat
down
on
a
bench
while
the
boy
went
in
and
talked
with
miss
scott
in
a
short
time
he
came
out
and
just
nodding
good-bye
to
the
woman
who
was
his
mother
went
away
she
did
not
look
insane
but
as
she
was
german
i
could
not
learn
her
story
her
name
however
was
mrs
louise
schanz
she
seemed
quite
lost
but
when
the
nurses
put
her
at
some
sewing
she
did
her
work
well
and
quickly
at
three
in
the
afternoon
all
the
patients
were
given
a
gruel
broth
and
at
five
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
piece
of
bread
i
was
favored
for
when
they
saw
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
eat
the
bread
or
drink
the
stuff
honored
by
the
name
of
tea
they
gave
me
a
cup
of
milk
and
a
cracker
the
same
as
i
had
had
at
noon
just
as
the
gas
was
being
lighted
another
patient
was
added
she
was
a
young
girl
twenty-five
years
old
she
told
me
that
she
had
just
gotten
up
from
a
sick
bed
her
appearance
confirmed
her
story
she
looked
like
one
who
had
had
a
severe
attack
of
fever
â€œi
am
now
suffering
from
nervous
debilityâ€
she
said
â€œand
my
friends
have
sent
me
here
to
be
treated
for
itâ€
i
did
not
tell
her
where
she
was
and
she
seemed
quite
satisfied
at
615
miss
ball
said
that
she
wanted
to
go
away
and
so
we
would
all
have
to
go
to
bed
then
each
of
usâ€”we
now
numbered
sixâ€”were
assigned
a
room
and
told
to
undress
i
did
so
and
was
given
a
short
cotton-flannel
gown
to
wear
during
the
night
then
she
took
every
particle
of
the
clothing
i
had
worn
during
the
day
and
making
it
up
in
a
bundle
labeled
it
â€œbrownâ€
and
took
it
away
the
iron-barred
window
was
locked
and
miss
ball
after
giving
me
an
extra
blanket
which
she
said
was
a
favor
rarely
granted
went
out
and
left
me
alone
the
bed
was
not
a
comfortable
one
it
was
so
hard
indeed
that
i
could
not
make
a
dent
in
it
and
the
pillow
was
stuffed
with
straw
under
the
sheet
was
an
oilcloth
spread
as
the
night
grew
colder
i
tried
to
warm
that
oilcloth
i
kept
on
trying
but
when
morning
dawned
and
it
was
still
as
cold
as
when
i
went
to
bed
and
had
reduced
me
too
to
the
temperature
of
an
iceberg
i
gave
it
up
as
an
impossible
task
i
had
hoped
to
get
some
rest
on
this
my
first
night
in
an
insane
asylum
but
i
was
doomed
to
disappointment
when
the
night
nurses
came
in
they
were
curious
to
see
me
and
to
find
out
what
i
was
like
no
sooner
had
they
left
than
i
heard
some
one
at
the
door
inquiring
for
nellie
brown
and
i
began
to
tremble
fearing
always
that
my
sanity
would
be
discovered
by
listening
to
the
conversation
i
found
it
was
a
reporter
in
search
of
me
and
i
heard
him
ask
for
my
clothing
so
that
he
might
examine
it
i
listened
quite
anxiously
to
the
talk
about
me
and
was
relieved
to
learn
that
i
was
considered
hopelessly
insane
that
was
encouraging
after
the
reporter
left
i
heard
new
arrivals
and
i
learned
that
a
doctor
was
there
and
intended
to
see
me
for
what
purpose
i
knew
not
and
i
imagined
all
sorts
of
horrible
things
such
as
examinations
and
the
rest
of
it
and
when
they
got
to
my
room
i
was
shaking
with
more
than
fear
â€œnellie
brown
here
is
the
doctor
he
wishes
to
speak
with
youâ€
said
the
nurse
if
thatâ€™s
all
he
wanted
i
thought
i
could
endure
it
i
removed
the
blanket
which
i
had
put
over
my
head
in
my
sudden
fright
and
looked
up
the
sight
was
reassuring
he
was
a
handsome
young
man
he
had
the
air
and
address
of
a
gentleman
some
people
have
since
censured
this
action
but
i
feel
sure
even
if
it
was
a
little
indiscreet
that
the
young
doctor
only
meant
kindness
to
me
he
came
forward
seated
himself
on
the
side
of
my
bed
and
put
his
arm
soothingly
around
my
shoulders
it
was
a
terrible
task
to
play
insane
before
this
young
man
and
only
a
girl
can
sympathize
with
me
in
my
position
â€œhow
do
you
feel
to-night
nellieâ€
he
asked
easily
â€œoh
i
feel
all
rightâ€
â€œbut
you
are
sick
you
knowâ€
he
said
â€œoh
am
iâ€
i
replied
and
i
turned
my
head
on
the
pillow
and
smiled
â€œwhen
did
you
leave
cuba
nellieâ€
â€œoh
you
know
my
homeâ€
i
asked
â€œyes
very
well
donâ€™t
you
remember
me
i
remember
youâ€
â€œdo
youâ€
and
i
mentally
said
i
should
not
forget
him
he
was
accompanied
by
a
friend
who
never
ventured
a
remark
but
stood
staring
at
me
as
i
lay
in
bed
after
a
great
many
questions
to
which
i
answered
truthfully
he
left
me
then
came
other
troubles
all
night
long
the
nurses
read
one
to
the
other
aloud
and
i
know
that
the
other
patients
as
well
as
myself
were
unable
to
sleep
every
half-hour
or
hour
they
would
walk
heavily
down
the
halls
their
boot-heels
resounding
like
the
march
of
a
private
of
dragoons
and
take
a
look
at
every
patient
of
course
this
helped
to
keep
us
awake
then
as
it
came
toward
morning
they
began
to
beat
eggs
for
breakfast
and
the
sound
made
me
realize
how
horribly
hungry
i
was
occasional
yells
and
cries
came
from
the
male
department
and
that
did
not
aid
in
making
the
night
pass
more
cheerfully
then
the
ambulance-gong
as
it
brought
in
more
unfortunates
sounded
as
a
knell
to
life
and
liberty
thus
i
passed
my
first
night
as
an
insane
girl
at
bellevue
the
goal
in
sight
at
6
oâ€™clock
on
sunday
morning
sept
25
the
nurses
pulled
the
covering
from
my
bed
â€œcome
itâ€™s
time
for
you
to
get
out
of
bedâ€
they
said
and
opened
the
window
and
let
in
the
cold
breeze
my
clothing
was
then
returned
to
me
after
dressing
i
was
shown
to
a
washstand
where
all
the
other
patients
were
trying
to
rid
their
faces
of
all
traces
of
sleep
at
7
oâ€™clock
we
were
given
some
horrible
mess
which
mary
told
us
was
chicken
broth
the
cold
from
which
we
had
suffered
enough
the
day
previous
was
bitter
and
when
i
complained
to
the
nurse
she
said
it
was
one
of
the
rules
of
the
institution
not
to
turn
the
heat
on
until
october
and
so
we
would
have
to
endure
it
as
the
steam-pipes
had
not
even
been
put
in
order
the
night
nurses
then
arming
themselves
with
scissors
began
to
play
manicure
on
the
patients
they
cut
my
nails
to
the
quick
as
they
did
those
of
several
of
the
other
patients
shortly
after
this
a
handsome
young
doctor
made
his
appearance
and
i
was
conducted
into
the
sitting-room
â€œwho
are
youâ€
he
asked
â€œnellie
morenoâ€
i
replied
â€œthen
why
did
you
give
the
name
of
brownâ€
he
asked
â€œwhat
is
wrong
with
youâ€
â€œnothing
i
did
not
want
to
come
here
but
they
brought
me
i
want
to
go
away
wonâ€™t
you
let
me
outâ€
â€œif
i
take
you
out
will
you
stay
with
me
wonâ€™t
you
run
away
from
me
when
you
get
on
the
streetâ€
â€œi
canâ€™t
promise
that
i
will
notâ€
i
answered
with
a
smile
and
a
sigh
for
he
was
handsome
he
asked
me
many
other
questions
did
i
ever
see
faces
on
the
wall
did
i
ever
hear
voices
around
i
answered
him
to
the
best
of
my
ability
â€œdo
you
ever
hear
voices
at
nightâ€
he
asked
â€œyes
there
is
so
much
talking
i
cannot
sleepâ€
â€œi
thought
soâ€
he
said
to
himself
then
turning
to
me
he
asked
â€œwhat
do
these
voices
sayâ€
â€œwell
i
do
not
listen
to
them
always
but
sometimes
very
often
they
talk
about
nellie
brown
and
then
on
other
subjects
that
do
not
interest
me
half
so
muchâ€
i
answered
truthfully
â€œthat
will
doâ€
he
said
to
miss
scott
who
was
just
on
the
outside
â€œcan
i
go
awayâ€
i
asked
â€œyesâ€
he
said
with
a
satisfied
laugh
â€œweâ€™ll
soon
send
you
awayâ€
â€œit
is
so
very
cold
here
i
want
to
go
outâ€
i
said
â€œthatâ€™s
trueâ€
he
said
to
miss
scott
â€œthe
cold
is
almost
unbearable
in
here
and
you
will
have
some
cases
of
pneumonia
if
you
are
not
carefulâ€
with
this
i
was
led
away
and
another
patient
was
taken
in
i
sat
right
outside
the
door
and
waited
to
hear
how
he
would
test
the
sanity
of
the
other
patients
with
little
variation
the
examination
was
exactly
the
same
as
mine
all
the
patients
were
asked
if
they
saw
faces
on
the
wall
heard
voices
and
what
they
said
i
might
also
add
each
patient
denied
any
such
peculiar
freaks
of
sight
and
hearing
at
10
oâ€™clock
we
were
given
a
cup
of
unsalted
beef
tea
at
noon
a
bit
of
cold
meat
and
a
potatoe
at
3
oâ€™clock
a
cup
of
oatmeal
gruel
and
at
530
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
slice
of
unbuttered
bread
we
were
all
cold
and
hungry
after
the
physician
left
we
were
given
shawls
and
told
to
walk
up
and
down
the
halls
in
order
to
get
warm
during
the
day
the
pavilion
was
visited
by
a
number
of
people
who
were
curious
to
see
the
crazy
girl
from
cuba
i
kept
my
head
covered
on
the
plea
of
being
cold
for
fear
some
of
the
reporters
would
recognize
me
some
of
the
visitors
were
apparently
in
search
of
a
missing
girl
for
i
was
made
to
take
down
the
shawl
repeatedly
and
after
they
looked
at
me
they
would
say
â€œi
donâ€™t
know
herâ€
or
â€œshe
is
not
the
oneâ€
for
which
i
was
secretly
thankful
warden
oâ€™rourke
visited
me
and
tried
his
arts
on
an
examination
then
he
brought
some
well-dressed
women
and
some
gentlemen
at
different
times
to
have
a
glance
at
the
mysterious
nellie
brown
the
reporters
were
the
most
troublesome
such
a
number
of
them
and
they
were
all
so
bright
and
clever
that
i
was
terribly
frightened
lest
they
should
see
that
i
was
sane
they
were
very
kind
and
nice
to
me
and
very
gentle
in
all
their
questionings
my
late
visitor
the
night
previous
came
to
the
window
while
some
reporters
were
interviewing
me
in
the
sitting-room
and
told
the
nurse
to
allow
them
to
see
me
as
they
would
be
of
assistance
in
finding
some
clew
as
to
my
identity
in
the
afternoon
dr
field
came
and
examined
me
he
asked
me
only
a
few
questions
and
ones
that
had
no
bearing
on
such
a
case
the
chief
question
was
of
my
home
and
friends
and
if
i
had
any
lovers
or
had
ever
been
married
then
he
made
me
stretch
out
my
arms
and
move
my
fingers
which
i
did
without
the
least
hesitation
yet
i
heard
him
say
my
case
was
hopeless
the
other
patients
were
asked
the
same
questions
as
the
doctor
was
about
to
leave
the
pavilion
miss
tillie
mayard
discovered
that
she
was
in
an
insane
ward
she
went
to
dr
field
and
asked
him
why
she
had
been
sent
there
â€œhave
you
just
found
out
you
are
in
an
insane
asylumâ€
asked
the
doctor
â€œyes
my
friends
said
they
were
sending
me
to
a
convalescent
ward
to
be
treated
for
nervous
debility
from
which
i
am
suffering
since
my
illness
i
want
to
get
out
of
this
place
immediatelyâ€
â€œwell
you
wonâ€™t
get
out
in
a
hurryâ€
he
said
with
a
quick
laugh
â€œif
you
know
anything
at
allâ€
she
responded
â€œyou
should
be
able
to
tell
that
i
am
perfectly
sane
why
donâ€™t
you
test
meâ€
â€œwe
know
all
we
want
to
on
that
scoreâ€
said
the
doctor
and
he
left
the
poor
girl
condemned
to
an
insane
asylum
probably
for
life
without
giving
her
one
feeble
chance
to
prove
her
sanity
sunday
night
was
but
a
repetition
of
saturday
all
night
long
we
were
kept
awake
by
the
talk
of
the
nurses
and
their
heavy
walking
through
the
uncarpeted
halls
on
monday
morning
we
were
told
that
we
should
be
taken
away
at
130
the
nurses
questioned
me
unceasingly
about
my
home
and
all
seemed
to
have
an
idea
that
i
had
a
lover
who
had
cast
me
forth
on
the
world
and
wrecked
my
brain
the
morning
brought
many
reporters
how
untiring
they
are
in
their
efforts
to
get
something
new
miss
scott
refused
to
allow
me
to
be
seen
however
and
for
this
i
was
thankful
had
they
been
given
free
access
to
me
i
should
probably
not
have
been
a
mystery
long
for
many
of
them
knew
me
by
sight
warden
oâ€™rourke
came
for
a
final
visit
and
had
a
short
conversation
with
me
he
wrote
his
name
in
my
notebook
saying
to
the
nurse
that
i
would
forget
all
about
it
in
an
hour
i
smiled
and
thought
i
wasnâ€™t
sure
of
that
other
people
called
to
see
me
but
none
knew
me
or
could
give
any
information
about
me
noon
came
i
grew
nervous
as
the
time
approached
to
leave
for
the
island
i
dreaded
every
new
arrival
fearful
that
my
secret
would
be
discovered
at
the
last
moment
then
i
was
given
a
shawl
and
my
hat
and
gloves
i
could
hardly
put
them
on
my
nerves
were
so
unstrung
at
last
the
attendant
arrived
and
i
bade
good-bye
to
mary
as
i
slipped
â€œa
few
penniesâ€
into
her
hand
â€œgod
bless
youâ€
she
said
â€œi
shall
pray
for
you
cheer
up
dearie
you
are
young
and
will
get
over
thisâ€
i
told
her
i
hoped
so
and
then
i
said
good-bye
to
miss
scott
in
spanish
the
rough-looking
attendant
twisted
his
arms
around
mine
and
half-led
half-dragged
me
to
an
ambulance
a
crowd
of
the
students
had
assembled
and
they
watched
us
curiously
i
put
the
shawl
over
my
face
and
sank
thankfully
into
the
wagon
miss
neville
miss
mayard
mrs
fox
and
mrs
schanz
were
all
put
in
after
me
one
at
a
time
a
man
got
in
with
us
the
doors
were
locked
and
we
were
driven
out
of
the
gates
in
great
style
on
toward
the
insane
asylum
and
victory
the
patients
made
no
move
to
escape
the
odor
of
the
male
attendantâ€™s
breath
was
enough
to
make
oneâ€™s
head
swim
when
we
reached
the
wharf
such
a
mob
of
people
crowded
around
the
wagon
that
the
police
were
called
to
put
them
away
so
that
we
could
reach
the
boat
i
was
the
last
of
the
procession
i
was
escorted
down
the
plank
the
fresh
breeze
blowing
the
attendantsâ€™
whisky
breath
into
my
face
until
i
staggered
i
was
taken
into
a
dirty
cabin
where
i
found
my
companions
seated
on
a
narrow
bench
the
small
windows
were
closed
and
with
the
smell
of
the
filthy
room
the
air
was
stifling
at
one
end
of
the
cabin
was
a
small
bunk
in
such
a
condition
that
i
had
to
hold
my
nose
when
i
went
near
it
a
sick
girl
was
put
on
it
an
old
woman
with
an
enormous
bonnet
and
a
dirty
basket
filled
with
chunks
of
bread
and
bits
of
scrap
meat
completed
our
company
the
door
was
guarded
by
two
female
attendants
one
was
clad
in
a
dress
made
of
bed-ticking
and
the
other
was
dressed
with
some
attempt
at
style
they
were
coarse
massive
women
and
expectorated
tobacco
juice
about
on
the
floor
in
a
manner
more
skillful
than
charming
one
of
these
fearful
creatures
seemed
to
have
much
faith
in
the
power
of
the
glance
on
insane
people
for
when
any
one
of
us
would
move
or
go
to
look
out
of
the
high
window
she
would
say
â€œsit
downâ€
and
would
lower
her
brows
and
glare
in
a
way
that
was
simply
terrifying
while
guarding
the
door
they
talked
with
some
men
on
the
outside
they
discussed
the
number
of
patients
and
then
their
own
affairs
in
a
manner
neither
edifying
nor
refined
illustration
on
board
the
island
boat
the
boat
stopped
and
the
old
woman
and
the
sick
girl
were
taken
off
the
rest
of
us
were
told
to
sit
still
at
the
next
stop
my
companions
were
taken
off
one
at
a
time
i
was
last
and
it
seemed
to
require
a
man
and
a
woman
to
lead
me
up
the
plank
to
reach
the
shore
an
ambulance
was
standing
there
and
in
it
were
the
four
other
patients
â€œwhat
is
this
placeâ€
i
asked
of
the
man
who
had
his
fingers
sunk
into
the
flesh
of
my
arm
â€œblackwellâ€™s
island
an
insane
place
where
youâ€™ll
never
get
out
ofâ€
with
this
i
was
shoved
into
the
ambulance
the
springboard
was
put
up
an
officer
and
a
mail-carrier
jumped
on
behind
and
i
was
swiftly
driven
to
the
insane
asylum
on
blackwellâ€™s
island
inside
the
mad-house
as
the
wagon
was
rapidly
driven
through
the
beautiful
lawns
up
to
the
asylum
my
feelings
of
satisfaction
at
having
attained
the
object
of
my
work
were
greatly
dampened
by
the
look
of
distress
on
the
faces
of
my
companions
poor
women
they
had
no
hopes
of
a
speedy
delivery
they
were
being
driven
to
a
prison
through
no
fault
of
their
own
in
all
probability
for
life
in
comparison
how
much
easier
it
would
be
to
walk
to
the
gallows
than
to
this
tomb
of
living
horrors
on
the
wagon
sped
and
i
as
well
as
my
comrades
gave
a
despairing
farewell
glance
at
freedom
as
we
came
in
sight
of
the
long
stone
buildings
we
passed
one
low
building
and
the
stench
was
so
horrible
that
i
was
compelled
to
hold
my
breath
and
i
mentally
decided
that
it
was
the
kitchen
i
afterward
found
i
was
correct
in
my
surmise
and
smiled
at
the
signboard
at
the
end
of
the
walk
â€œvisitors
are
not
allowed
on
this
roadâ€
i
donâ€™t
think
the
sign
would
be
necessary
if
they
once
tried
the
road
especially
on
a
warm
day
the
wagon
stopped
and
the
nurse
and
officer
in
charge
told
us
to
get
out
the
nurse
added
â€œthank
god
they
came
quietlyâ€
we
obeyed
orders
to
go
ahead
up
a
flight
of
narrow
stone
steps
which
had
evidently
been
built
for
the
accommodation
of
people
who
climb
stairs
three
at
a
time
i
wondered
if
my
companions
knew
where
we
were
so
i
said
to
miss
tillie
mayard
â€œwhere
are
weâ€
â€œat
the
blackwellâ€™s
island
lunatic
asylumâ€
she
answered
sadly
â€œare
you
crazyâ€
i
asked
â€œnoâ€
she
replied
â€œbut
as
we
have
been
sent
here
we
will
have
to
be
quiet
until
we
find
some
means
of
escape
they
will
be
few
though
if
all
the
doctors
as
dr
field
refuse
to
listen
to
me
or
give
me
a
chance
to
prove
my
sanityâ€
we
were
ushered
into
a
narrow
vestibule
and
the
door
was
locked
behind
us
in
spite
of
the
knowledge
of
my
sanity
and
the
assurance
that
i
would
be
released
in
a
few
days
my
heart
gave
a
sharp
twinge
pronounced
insane
by
four
expert
doctors
and
shut
up
behind
the
unmerciful
bolts
and
bars
of
a
mad-house
not
to
be
confined
alone
but
to
be
a
companion
day
and
night
of
senseless
chattering
lunatics
to
sleep
with
them
to
eat
with
them
to
be
considered
one
of
them
was
an
uncomfortable
position
timidly
we
followed
the
nurse
up
the
long
uncarpeted
hall
to
a
room
filled
by
so-called
crazy
women
we
were
told
to
sit
down
and
some
of
the
patients
kindly
made
room
for
us
they
looked
at
us
curiously
and
one
came
up
to
me
and
asked
â€œwho
sent
you
hereâ€
â€œthe
doctorsâ€
i
answered
â€œwhat
forâ€
she
persisted
â€œwell
they
say
i
am
insaneâ€
i
admitted
â€œinsaneâ€
she
repeated
incredulously
â€œit
cannot
be
seen
in
your
faceâ€
this
woman
was
too
clever
i
concluded
and
was
glad
to
answer
the
roughly
given
orders
to
follow
the
nurse
to
see
the
doctor
this
nurse
miss
grupe
by
the
way
had
a
nice
german
face
and
if
i
had
not
detected
certain
hard
lines
about
the
mouth
i
might
have
expected
as
did
my
companions
to
receive
but
kindness
from
her
she
left
us
in
a
small
waiting-room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
left
us
alone
while
she
went
into
a
small
office
opening
into
the
sitting
or
receiving-room
â€œi
like
to
go
down
in
the
wagonâ€
she
said
to
the
invisible
party
on
the
inside
â€œit
helps
to
break
up
the
dayâ€
he
answered
her
that
the
open
air
improved
her
looks
and
she
again
appeared
before
us
all
smiles
and
simpers
illustration
the
insane
asylum
â€œcome
here
tillie
mayardâ€
she
said
miss
mayard
obeyed
and
though
i
could
not
see
into
the
office
i
could
hear
her
gently
but
firmly
pleading
her
case
all
her
remarks
were
as
rational
as
any
i
ever
heard
and
i
thought
no
good
physician
could
help
but
be
impressed
with
her
story
she
told
of
her
recent
illness
that
she
was
suffering
from
nervous
debility
she
begged
that
they
try
all
their
tests
for
insanity
if
they
had
any
and
give
her
justice
poor
girl
how
my
heart
ached
for
her
i
determined
then
and
there
that
i
would
try
by
every
means
to
make
my
mission
of
benefit
to
my
suffering
sisters
that
i
would
show
how
they
are
committed
without
ample
trial
without
one
word
of
sympathy
or
encouragement
she
was
brought
back
to
where
we
sat
mrs
louise
schanz
was
taken
into
the
presence
of
dr
kinier
the
medical
man
â€œyour
nameâ€
he
asked
loudly
she
answered
in
german
saying
she
did
not
speak
english
nor
could
she
understand
it
however
when
he
said
mrs
louise
schanz
she
said
â€œyah
yahâ€
then
he
tried
other
questions
and
when
he
found
she
could
not
understand
one
word
of
english
he
said
to
miss
grupe
â€œyou
are
german
speak
to
her
for
meâ€
miss
grupe
proved
to
be
one
of
those
people
who
are
ashamed
of
their
nationality
and
she
refused
saying
she
could
understand
but
few
words
of
her
mother
tongue
â€œyou
know
you
speak
german
ask
this
woman
what
her
husband
doesâ€
and
they
both
laughed
as
if
they
were
enjoying
a
joke
â€œi
canâ€™t
speak
but
a
few
wordsâ€
she
protested
but
at
last
she
managed
to
ascertain
the
occupation
of
mr
schanz
â€œnow
what
was
the
use
of
lying
to
meâ€
asked
the
doctor
with
a
laugh
which
dispelled
the
rudeness
â€œi
canâ€™t
speak
any
moreâ€
she
said
and
she
did
not
thus
was
mrs
louise
schanz
consigned
to
the
asylum
without
a
chance
of
making
herself
understood
can
such
carelessness
be
excused
i
wonder
when
it
is
so
easy
to
get
an
interpreter
if
the
confinement
was
but
for
a
few
days
one
might
question
the
necessity
but
here
was
a
woman
taken
without
her
own
consent
from
a
free
world
to
an
asylum
and
there
given
no
chance
to
prove
her
sanity
confined
most
probably
for
life
behind
asylum
bars
without
even
being
told
in
her
language
the
why
and
wherefore
compare
this
with
a
criminal
who
is
given
every
chance
to
prove
his
innocence
who
would
not
rather
be
a
murderer
and
take
the
chance
for
life
than
be
declared
insane
without
hope
of
escape
mrs
schanz
begged
in
german
to
know
where
she
was
and
pleaded
for
liberty
her
voice
broken
by
sobs
she
was
led
unheard
out
to
us
illustration
the
front
hallway
mrs
fox
was
then
put
through
this
weak
trifling
examination
and
brought
from
the
office
convicted
miss
annie
neville
took
her
turn
and
i
was
again
left
to
the
last
i
had
by
this
time
determined
to
act
as
i
do
when
free
except
that
i
would
refuse
to
tell
who
i
was
or
where
my
home
was
an
expert
at
work
â€œnellie
brown
the
doctor
wants
youâ€
said
miss
grupe
i
went
in
and
was
told
to
sit
down
opposite
dr
kinier
at
the
desk
â€œwhat
is
your
nameâ€
he
asked
without
looking
up
â€œnellie
brownâ€
i
replied
easily
â€œwhere
is
your
homeâ€
writing
what
i
had
said
down
in
a
large
book
â€œin
cubaâ€
â€œohâ€
he
ejaculated
with
sudden
understandingâ€”then
addressing
the
nurse
â€œdid
you
see
anything
in
the
papers
about
herâ€
â€œyesâ€
she
replied
â€œi
saw
a
long
account
of
this
girl
in
the
sun
on
sundayâ€
then
the
doctor
said
â€œkeep
her
here
until
i
go
to
the
office
and
see
the
notice
againâ€
he
left
us
and
i
was
relieved
of
my
hat
and
shawl
on
his
return
he
said
he
had
been
unable
to
find
the
paper
but
he
related
the
story
of
my
debut
as
he
had
read
it
to
the
nurse
â€œwhatâ€™s
the
color
of
her
eyesâ€
miss
grupe
looked
and
answered
â€œgrayâ€
although
everybody
had
always
said
my
eyes
were
brown
or
hazel
â€œwhatâ€™s
your
ageâ€
he
asked
and
as
i
answered
â€œnineteen
last
mayâ€
he
turned
to
the
nurse
and
said
â€œwhen
do
you
get
your
next
passâ€
this
i
ascertained
was
a
leave
of
absence
or
â€œa
day
offâ€
â€œnext
saturdayâ€
she
said
with
a
laugh
â€œyou
will
go
to
townâ€
and
they
both
laughed
as
she
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
he
said
â€œmeasure
herâ€
i
was
stood
under
a
measure
and
it
was
brought
down
tightly
on
my
head
â€œwhat
is
itâ€
asked
the
doctor
â€œnow
you
know
i
canâ€™t
tellâ€
she
said
â€œyes
you
can
go
ahead
what
heightâ€
â€œi
donâ€™t
know
there
are
some
figures
there
but
i
canâ€™t
tellâ€
â€œyes
you
can
now
look
and
tell
meâ€
â€œi
canâ€™t
do
it
yourselfâ€
and
they
laughed
again
as
the
doctor
left
his
place
at
the
desk
and
came
forward
to
see
for
himself
â€œfive
feet
five
inches
donâ€™t
you
seeâ€
he
said
taking
her
hand
and
touching
the
figures
by
her
voice
i
knew
she
did
not
understand
yet
but
that
was
no
concern
of
mine
as
the
doctor
seemed
to
find
a
pleasure
in
aiding
her
then
i
was
put
on
the
scales
and
she
worked
around
until
she
got
them
to
balance
â€œhow
muchâ€
asked
the
doctor
having
resumed
his
position
at
the
desk
â€œi
donâ€™t
know
you
will
have
to
see
for
yourselfâ€
she
replied
calling
him
by
his
christian
name
which
i
have
forgotten
he
turned
and
also
addressing
her
by
her
baptismal
name
he
said
â€œyou
are
getting
too
freshâ€
and
they
both
laughed
i
then
told
the
weightâ€”112
poundsâ€”to
the
nurse
and
she
in
turn
told
the
doctor
â€œwhat
time
are
you
going
to
supperâ€
he
asked
and
she
told
him
he
gave
the
nurse
more
attention
than
he
did
me
and
asked
her
six
questions
to
every
one
of
me
then
he
wrote
my
fate
in
the
book
before
him
i
said
â€œi
am
not
sick
and
i
do
not
want
to
stay
here
no
one
has
a
right
to
shut
me
up
in
this
mannerâ€
he
took
no
notice
of
my
remarks
and
having
completed
his
writings
as
well
as
his
talk
with
the
nurse
for
the
moment
he
said
that
would
do
and
with
my
companions
i
went
back
to
the
sitting-room
â€œyou
play
the
pianoâ€
they
asked
â€œoh
yes
ever
since
i
was
a
childâ€
i
replied
then
they
insisted
that
i
should
play
and
they
seated
me
on
a
wooden
chair
before
an
old-fashioned
square
i
struck
a
few
notes
and
the
untuned
response
sent
a
grinding
chill
through
me
â€œhow
horribleâ€
i
exclaimed
turning
to
a
nurse
miss
mccarten
who
stood
at
my
side
â€œi
never
touched
a
piano
as
much
out
of
tuneâ€
â€œitâ€™s
a
pity
of
youâ€
she
said
spitefully
â€œweâ€™ll
have
to
get
one
made
to
order
for
youâ€
i
began
to
play
the
variations
of
â€œhome
sweet
homeâ€
the
talking
ceased
and
every
patient
sat
silent
while
my
cold
fingers
moved
slowly
and
stiffly
over
the
keyboard
i
finished
in
an
aimless
fashion
and
refused
all
requests
to
play
more
not
seeing
an
available
place
to
sit
i
still
occupied
the
chair
in
the
front
of
the
piano
while
i
â€œsized
upâ€
my
surroundings
it
was
a
long
bare
room
with
bare
yellow
benches
encircling
it
these
benches
which
were
perfectly
straight
and
just
as
uncomfortable
would
hold
five
people
although
in
almost
every
instance
six
were
crowded
on
them
barred
windows
built
about
five
feet
from
the
floor
faced
the
two
double
doors
which
led
into
the
hall
the
bare
white
walls
were
somewhat
relieved
by
three
lithographs
one
of
fritz
emmet
and
the
others
of
negro
minstrels
in
the
center
of
the
room
was
a
large
table
covered
with
a
white
bed-spread
and
around
it
sat
the
nurses
everything
was
spotlessly
clean
and
i
thought
what
good
workers
the
nurses
must
be
to
keep
such
order
in
a
few
days
after
how
i
laughed
at
my
own
stupidity
to
think
the
nurses
would
work
when
they
found
i
would
not
play
any
more
miss
mccarten
came
up
to
me
saying
roughly
â€œget
away
from
hereâ€
and
closed
the
piano
with
a
bang
â€œbrown
come
hereâ€
was
the
next
order
i
got
from
a
rough
red-faced
woman
at
the
table
â€œwhat
have
you
onâ€
â€œmy
clothingâ€
i
replied
she
lifted
my
dress
and
skirts
and
wrote
down
one
pair
shoes
one
pair
stockings
one
cloth
dress
one
straw
sailor
hat
and
so
on
my
first
supper
this
examination
over
we
heard
some
one
yell
â€œgo
out
into
the
hallâ€
one
of
the
patients
kindly
explained
that
this
was
an
invitation
to
supper
we
late
comers
tried
to
keep
together
so
we
entered
the
hall
and
stood
at
the
door
where
all
the
women
had
crowded
how
we
shivered
as
we
stood
there
the
windows
were
open
and
the
draught
went
whizzing
through
the
hall
the
patients
looked
blue
with
cold
and
the
minutes
stretched
into
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
last
one
of
the
nurses
went
forward
and
unlocked
a
door
through
which
we
all
crowded
to
a
landing
of
the
stairway
here
again
came
a
long
halt
directly
before
an
open
window
â€œhow
very
imprudent
for
the
attendants
to
keep
these
thinly
clad
women
standing
here
in
the
coldâ€
said
miss
neville
i
looked
at
the
poor
crazy
captives
shivering
and
added
emphatically
â€œitâ€™s
horribly
brutalâ€
while
they
stood
there
i
thought
i
would
not
relish
supper
that
night
they
looked
so
lost
and
hopeless
some
were
chattering
nonsense
to
invisible
persons
others
were
laughing
or
crying
aimlessly
and
one
old
gray-haired
woman
was
nudging
me
and
with
winks
and
sage
noddings
of
the
head
and
pitiful
uplifting
of
the
eyes
and
hands
was
assuring
me
that
i
must
not
mind
the
poor
creatures
as
they
were
all
mad
â€œstop
at
the
heaterâ€
was
then
ordered
â€œand
get
in
line
two
by
twoâ€
â€œmary
get
a
companionâ€
â€œhow
many
times
must
i
tell
you
to
keep
in
lineâ€
â€œstand
stillâ€
and
as
the
orders
were
issued
a
shove
and
a
push
were
administered
and
often
a
slap
on
the
ears
after
this
third
and
final
halt
we
were
marched
into
a
long
narrow
dining-room
where
a
rush
was
made
for
the
table
the
table
reached
the
length
of
the
room
and
was
uncovered
and
uninviting
long
benches
without
backs
were
put
for
the
patients
to
sit
on
and
over
these
they
had
to
crawl
in
order
to
face
the
table
placed
close
together
all
along
the
table
were
large
dressing-bowls
filled
with
a
pinkish-looking
stuff
which
the
patients
called
tea
by
each
bowl
was
laid
a
piece
of
bread
cut
thick
and
buttered
a
small
saucer
containing
five
prunes
accompanied
the
bread
one
fat
woman
made
a
rush
and
jerking
up
several
saucers
from
those
around
her
emptied
their
contents
into
her
own
saucer
then
while
holding
to
her
own
bowl
she
lifted
up
another
and
drained
its
contents
at
one
gulp
this
she
did
to
a
second
bowl
in
shorter
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
indeed
i
was
so
amused
at
her
successful
grabbings
that
when
i
looked
at
my
own
share
the
woman
opposite
without
so
much
as
by
your
leave
grabbed
my
bread
and
left
me
without
any
another
patient
seeing
this
kindly
offered
me
hers
but
i
declined
with
thanks
and
turned
to
the
nurse
and
asked
for
more
as
she
flung
a
thick
piece
down
on
the
table
she
made
some
remark
about
the
fact
that
if
i
forgot
where
my
home
was
i
had
not
forgotten
how
to
eat
i
tried
the
bread
but
the
butter
was
so
horrible
that
one
could
not
eat
it
a
blue-eyed
german
girl
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
told
me
i
could
have
bread
unbuttered
if
i
wished
and
that
very
few
were
able
to
eat
the
butter
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
prunes
and
found
that
very
few
of
them
would
be
sufficient
a
patient
near
asked
me
to
give
them
to
her
i
did
so
my
bowl
of
tea
was
all
that
was
left
i
tasted
and
one
taste
was
enough
it
had
no
sugar
and
it
tasted
as
if
it
had
been
made
in
copper
it
was
as
weak
as
water
this
was
also
transferred
to
a
hungrier
patient
in
spite
of
the
protest
of
miss
neville
â€œyou
must
force
the
food
downâ€
she
said
â€œelse
you
will
be
sick
and
who
knows
but
what
with
these
surroundings
you
may
go
crazy
to
have
a
good
brain
the
stomach
must
be
cared
forâ€
â€œit
is
impossible
for
me
to
eat
that
stuffâ€
i
replied
and
despite
all
her
urging
i
ate
nothing
that
night
it
did
not
require
much
time
for
the
patients
to
consume
all
that
was
eatable
on
the
table
and
then
we
got
our
orders
to
form
in
line
in
the
hall
when
this
was
done
the
doors
before
us
were
unlocked
and
we
were
ordered
to
proceed
back
to
the
sitting-room
many
of
the
patients
crowded
near
us
and
i
was
again
urged
to
play
both
by
them
and
by
the
nurses
to
please
the
patients
i
promised
to
play
and
miss
tillie
mayard
was
to
sing
the
first
thing
she
asked
me
to
play
was
â€œrock-a-bye
babyâ€
and
i
did
so
she
sang
it
beautifully
in
the
bath
a
few
more
songs
and
we
were
told
to
go
with
miss
grupe
we
were
taken
into
a
cold
wet
bathroom
and
i
was
ordered
to
undress
did
i
protest
well
i
never
grew
so
earnest
in
my
life
as
when
i
tried
to
beg
off
they
said
if
i
did
not
they
would
use
force
and
that
it
would
not
be
very
gentle
at
this
i
noticed
one
of
the
craziest
women
in
the
ward
standing
by
the
filled
bathtub
with
a
large
discolored
rag
in
her
hands
she
was
chattering
away
to
herself
and
chuckling
in
a
manner
which
seemed
to
me
fiendish
i
knew
now
what
was
to
be
done
with
me
i
shivered
they
began
to
undress
me
and
one
by
one
they
pulled
off
my
clothes
at
last
everything
was
gone
excepting
one
garment
â€œi
will
not
remove
itâ€
i
said
vehemently
but
they
took
it
off
i
gave
one
glance
at
the
group
of
patients
gathered
at
the
door
watching
the
scene
and
i
jumped
into
the
bathtub
with
more
energy
than
grace
illustration
the
reception-room
the
water
was
ice-cold
and
i
again
began
to
protest
how
useless
it
all
was
i
begged
at
least
that
the
patients
be
made
to
go
away
but
was
ordered
to
shut
up
the
crazy
woman
began
to
scrub
me
i
can
find
no
other
word
that
will
express
it
but
scrubbing
from
a
small
tin
pan
she
took
some
soft
soap
and
rubbed
it
all
over
me
even
all
over
my
face
and
my
pretty
hair
i
was
at
last
past
seeing
or
speaking
although
i
had
begged
that
my
hair
be
left
untouched
rub
rub
rub
went
the
old
woman
chattering
to
herself
my
teeth
chattered
and
my
limbs
were
goose-fleshed
and
blue
with
cold
suddenly
i
got
one
after
the
other
three
buckets
of
water
over
my
headâ€”ice-cold
water
tooâ€”into
my
eyes
my
ears
my
nose
and
my
mouth
i
think
i
experienced
some
of
the
sensations
of
a
drowning
person
as
they
dragged
me
gasping
shivering
and
quaking
from
the
tub
for
once
i
did
look
insane
i
caught
a
glance
of
the
indescribable
look
on
the
faces
of
my
companions
who
had
witnessed
my
fate
and
knew
theirs
was
surely
following
unable
to
control
myself
at
the
absurd
picture
i
presented
i
burst
into
roars
of
laughter
they
put
me
dripping
wet
into
a
short
canton
flannel
slip
labeled
across
the
extreme
end
in
large
black
letters
â€œlunatic
asylum
b
i
h
6â€
the
letters
meant
blackwellâ€™s
island
hall
6
by
this
time
miss
mayard
had
been
undressed
and
much
as
i
hated
my
recent
bath
i
would
have
taken
another
if
by
it
i
could
have
saved
her
the
experience
imagine
plunging
that
sick
girl
into
a
cold
bath
when
it
made
me
who
has
never
been
ill
shake
as
if
with
ague
i
heard
her
explain
to
miss
grupe
that
her
head
was
still
sore
from
her
illness
her
hair
was
short
and
had
mostly
come
out
and
she
asked
that
the
crazy
woman
be
made
to
rub
more
gently
but
miss
grupe
said
â€œthere
isnâ€™t
much
fear
of
hurting
you
shut
up
or
youâ€™ll
get
it
worseâ€
miss
mayard
did
shut
up
and
that
was
my
last
look
at
her
for
the
night
i
was
hurried
into
a
room
where
there
were
six
beds
and
had
been
put
into
bed
when
some
one
came
along
and
jerked
me
out
again
saying
â€œnellie
brown
has
to
be
put
in
a
room
alone
to-night
for
i
suppose
sheâ€™s
noisyâ€
i
was
taken
to
room
28
and
left
to
try
and
make
an
impression
on
the
bed
it
was
an
impossible
task
the
bed
had
been
made
high
in
the
center
and
sloping
on
either
side
at
the
first
touch
my
head
flooded
the
pillow
with
water
and
my
wet
slip
transferred
some
of
its
dampness
to
the
sheet
when
miss
grupe
came
in
i
asked
if
i
could
not
have
a
night-gown
â€œwe
have
no
such
things
in
this
institutionâ€
she
said
â€œi
do
not
like
to
sleep
withoutâ€
i
replied
â€œwell
i
donâ€™t
care
about
thatâ€
she
said
â€œyou
are
in
a
public
institution
now
and
you
canâ€™t
expect
to
get
anything
this
is
charity
and
you
should
be
thankful
for
what
you
getâ€
â€œbut
the
city
pays
to
keep
these
places
upâ€
i
urged
â€œand
pays
people
to
be
kind
to
the
unfortunates
brought
hereâ€
â€œwell
you
donâ€™t
need
to
expect
any
kindness
here
for
you
wonâ€™t
get
itâ€
she
said
and
she
went
out
and
closed
the
door
illustration
her
bedroom
a
sheet
and
an
oilcloth
were
under
me
and
a
sheet
and
black
wool
blanket
above
i
never
felt
anything
so
annoying
as
that
wool
blanket
as
i
tried
to
keep
it
around
my
shoulders
to
stop
the
chills
from
getting
underneath
when
i
pulled
it
up
i
left
my
feet
bare
and
when
i
pulled
it
down
my
shoulders
were
exposed
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
room
but
the
bed
and
myself
as
the
door
had
been
locked
i
imagined
i
should
be
left
alone
for
the
night
but
i
heard
the
sound
of
the
heavy
tread
of
two
women
down
the
hall
they
stopped
at
every
door
unlocked
it
and
in
a
few
moments
i
could
hear
them
relock
it
this
they
did
without
the
least
attempt
at
quietness
down
the
whole
length
of
the
opposite
side
of
the
hall
and
up
to
my
room
here
they
paused
the
key
was
inserted
in
the
lock
and
turned
i
watched
those
about
to
enter
in
they
came
dressed
in
brown
and
white
striped
dresses
fastened
by
brass
buttons
large
white
aprons
a
heavy
green
cord
about
the
waist
from
which
dangled
a
bunch
of
large
keys
and
small
white
caps
on
their
heads
being
dressed
as
were
the
attendants
of
the
day
i
knew
they
were
nurses
the
first
one
carried
a
lantern
and
she
flashed
its
light
into
my
face
while
she
said
to
her
assistant
â€œthis
is
nellie
brownâ€
looking
at
her
i
asked
â€œwho
are
youâ€
â€œthe
night
nurse
my
dearâ€
she
replied
and
wishing
that
i
would
sleep
well
she
went
out
and
locked
the
door
after
her
several
times
during
the
night
they
came
into
my
room
and
even
had
i
been
able
to
sleep
the
unlocking
of
the
heavy
door
their
loud
talking
and
heavy
tread
would
have
awakened
me
i
could
not
sleep
so
i
lay
in
bed
picturing
to
myself
the
horrors
in
case
a
fire
should
break
out
in
the
asylum
every
door
is
locked
separately
and
the
windows
are
heavily
barred
so
that
escape
is
impossible
in
the
one
building
alone
there
are
i
think
dr
ingram
told
me
some
three
hundred
women
they
are
locked
one
to
ten
to
a
room
it
is
impossible
to
get
out
unless
these
doors
are
unlocked
a
fire
is
not
improbable
but
one
of
the
most
likely
occurrences
should
the
building
burn
the
jailers
or
nurses
would
never
think
of
releasing
their
crazy
patients
this
i
can
prove
to
you
later
when
i
come
to
tell
of
their
cruel
treatment
of
the
poor
things
intrusted
to
their
care
as
i
say
in
case
of
fire
not
a
dozen
women
could
escape
all
would
be
left
to
roast
to
death
even
if
the
nurses
were
kind
which
they
are
not
it
would
require
more
presence
of
mind
than
women
of
their
class
possess
to
risk
the
flames
and
their
own
lives
while
they
unlocked
the
hundred
doors
for
the
insane
prisoners
unless
there
is
a
change
there
will
some
day
be
a
tale
of
horror
never
equaled
in
this
connection
is
an
amusing
incident
which
happened
just
previous
to
my
release
i
was
talking
with
dr
ingram
about
many
things
and
at
last
told
him
what
i
thought
would
be
the
result
of
a
fire
â€œthe
nurses
are
expected
to
open
the
doorsâ€
he
said
â€œbut
you
know
positively
that
they
would
not
wait
to
do
thatâ€
i
said
â€œand
these
women
would
burn
to
deathâ€
he
sat
silent
unable
to
contradict
my
assertion
â€œwhy
donâ€™t
you
have
it
changedâ€
i
asked
â€œwhat
can
i
doâ€
he
replied
â€œi
offer
suggestions
until
my
brain
is
tired
but
what
good
does
it
do
what
would
you
doâ€
he
asked
turning
to
me
the
proclaimed
insane
girl
â€œwell
i
should
insist
on
them
having
locks
put
in
as
i
have
seen
in
some
places
that
by
turning
a
crank
at
the
end
of
the
hall
you
can
lock
or
unlock
every
door
on
the
one
side
then
there
would
be
some
chance
of
escape
now
every
door
being
locked
separately
there
is
absolutely
noneâ€
dr
ingram
turned
to
me
with
an
anxious
look
on
his
kind
face
as
he
asked
slowly
â€œnellie
brown
what
institution
have
you
been
an
inmate
of
before
you
came
hereâ€
â€œnone
i
never
was
confined
in
any
institution
except
boarding-school
in
my
lifeâ€
â€œwhere
then
did
you
see
the
locks
you
have
describedâ€
i
had
seen
them
in
the
new
western
penitentiary
at
pittsburg
pa
but
i
did
not
dare
say
so
i
merely
answered
â€œoh
i
have
seen
them
in
a
place
i
was
inâ€”i
mean
as
a
visitorâ€
â€œthere
is
only
one
place
i
know
of
where
they
have
those
locksâ€
he
said
sadly
â€œand
that
is
at
sing
singâ€
the
inference
is
conclusive
i
laughed
very
heartily
over
the
implied
accusation
and
tried
to
assure
him
that
i
had
never
up
to
date
been
an
inmate
of
sing
sing
or
even
ever
visited
it
just
as
the
morning
began
to
dawn
i
went
to
sleep
it
did
not
seem
many
moments
until
i
was
rudely
awakened
and
told
to
get
up
the
window
being
opened
and
the
clothing
pulled
off
me
my
hair
was
still
wet
and
i
had
pains
all
through
me
as
if
i
had
the
rheumatism
some
clothing
was
flung
on
the
floor
and
i
was
told
to
put
it
on
i
asked
for
my
own
but
was
told
to
take
what
i
got
and
keep
quiet
by
the
apparently
head
nurse
miss
grady
i
looked
at
it
one
underskirt
made
of
coarse
dark
cotton
goods
and
a
cheap
white
calico
dress
with
a
black
spot
in
it
i
tied
the
strings
of
the
skirt
around
me
and
put
on
the
little
dress
it
was
made
as
are
all
those
worn
by
the
patients
into
a
straight
tight
waist
sewed
on
to
a
straight
skirt
as
i
buttoned
the
waist
i
noticed
the
underskirt
was
about
six
inches
longer
than
the
upper
and
for
a
moment
i
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
laughed
at
my
own
appearance
no
woman
ever
longed
for
a
mirror
more
than
i
did
at
that
moment
i
saw
the
other
patients
hurrying
past
in
the
hall
so
i
decided
not
to
lose
anything
that
might
be
going
on
we
numbered
forty-five
patients
in
hall
6
and
were
sent
to
the
bathroom
where
there
were
two
coarse
towels
i
watched
crazy
patients
who
had
the
most
dangerous
eruptions
all
over
their
faces
dry
on
the
towels
and
then
saw
women
with
clean
skins
turn
to
use
them
i
went
to
the
bathtub
and
washed
my
face
at
the
running
faucet
and
my
underskirt
did
duty
for
a
towel
before
i
had
completed
my
ablutions
a
bench
was
brought
into
the
bathroom
miss
grupe
and
miss
mccarten
came
in
with
combs
in
their
hands
we
were
told
to
sit
down
on
the
bench
and
the
hair
of
forty-five
women
was
combed
with
one
patient
two
nurses
and
six
combs
as
i
saw
some
of
the
sore
heads
combed
i
thought
this
was
another
dose
i
had
not
bargained
for
miss
tillie
mayard
had
her
own
comb
but
it
was
taken
from
her
by
miss
grady
oh
that
combing
i
never
realized
before
what
the
expression
â€œiâ€™ll
give
you
a
combingâ€
meant
but
i
knew
then
my
hair
all
matted
and
wet
from
the
night
previous
was
pulled
and
jerked
and
after
expostulating
to
no
avail
i
set
my
teeth
and
endured
the
pain
they
refused
to
give
me
my
hairpins
and
my
hair
was
arranged
in
one
plait
and
tied
with
a
red
cotton
rag
my
curly
bangs
refused
to
stay
back
so
that
at
least
was
left
of
my
former
glory
after
this
we
went
to
the
sitting-room
and
i
looked
for
my
companions
at
first
i
looked
vainly
unable
to
distinguish
them
from
the
other
patients
but
after
awhile
i
recognized
miss
mayard
by
her
short
hair
â€œhow
did
you
sleep
after
your
cold
bathâ€
â€œi
almost
froze
and
then
the
noise
kept
me
awake
itâ€™s
dreadful
my
nerves
were
so
unstrung
before
i
came
here
and
i
fear
i
shall
not
be
able
to
stand
the
strainâ€
i
did
the
best
i
could
to
cheer
her
i
asked
that
we
be
given
additional
clothing
at
least
as
much
as
custom
says
women
shall
wear
but
they
told
me
to
shut
up
that
we
had
as
much
as
they
intended
to
give
us
we
were
compelled
to
get
up
at
530
oâ€™clock
and
at
715
we
were
told
to
collect
in
the
hall
where
the
experience
of
waiting
as
on
the
evening
previous
was
repeated
when
we
got
into
the
dining-room
at
last
we
found
a
bowl
of
cold
tea
a
slice
of
buttered
bread
and
a
saucer
of
oatmeal
with
molasses
on
it
for
each
patient
i
was
hungry
but
the
food
would
not
down
i
asked
for
unbuttered
bread
and
was
given
it
i
cannot
tell
you
of
anything
which
is
the
same
dirty
black
color
it
was
hard
and
in
places
nothing
more
than
dried
dough
i
found
a
spider
in
my
slice
so
i
did
not
eat
it
i
tried
the
oatmeal
and
molasses
but
it
was
wretched
and
so
i
endeavored
but
without
much
show
of
success
to
choke
down
the
tea
after
we
were
back
to
the
sitting-room
a
number
of
women
were
ordered
to
make
the
beds
and
some
of
the
patients
were
put
to
scrubbing
and
others
given
different
duties
which
covered
all
the
work
in
the
hall
it
is
not
the
attendants
who
keep
the
institution
so
nice
for
the
poor
patients
as
i
had
always
thought
but
the
patients
who
do
it
all
themselvesâ€”even
to
cleaning
the
nursesâ€™
bedrooms
and
caring
for
their
clothing
about
930
the
new
patients
of
which
i
was
one
were
told
to
go
out
to
see
the
doctor
i
was
taken
in
and
my
lungs
and
my
heart
were
examined
by
the
flirty
young
doctor
who
was
the
first
to
see
us
the
day
we
entered
the
one
who
made
out
the
report
if
i
mistake
not
was
the
assistant
superintendent
ingram
a
few
questions
and
i
was
allowed
to
return
to
the
sitting-room
i
came
in
and
saw
miss
grady
with
my
notebook
and
long
lead
pencil
bought
just
for
the
occasion
â€œi
want
my
book
and
pencilâ€
i
said
quite
truthfully
â€œit
helps
me
remember
thingsâ€
i
was
very
anxious
to
get
it
to
make
notes
in
and
was
disappointed
when
she
said
â€œyou
canâ€™t
have
it
so
shut
upâ€
some
days
after
i
asked
dr
ingram
if
i
could
have
it
and
he
promised
to
consider
the
matter
when
i
again
referred
to
it
he
said
that
miss
grady
said
i
only
brought
a
book
there
that
i
had
no
pencil
i
was
provoked
and
insisted
that
i
had
whereupon
i
was
advised
to
fight
against
the
imaginations
of
my
brain
after
the
housework
was
completed
by
the
patients
and
as
the
day
was
fine
but
cold
we
were
told
to
go
out
in
the
hall
and
get
on
shawls
and
hats
for
a
walk
poor
patients
how
eager
they
were
for
a
breath
of
air
how
eager
for
a
slight
release
from
their
prison
they
went
swiftly
into
the
hall
and
there
was
a
skirmish
for
hats
such
hats
illustration
an
insane
hall
promenading
with
lunatics
i
shall
never
forget
my
first
walk
when
all
the
patients
had
donned
the
white
straw
hats
such
as
bathers
wear
at
coney
island
i
could
not
but
laugh
at
their
comical
appearances
i
could
not
distinguish
one
woman
from
another
i
lost
miss
neville
and
had
to
take
my
hat
off
and
search
for
her
when
we
met
we
put
our
hats
on
and
laughed
at
one
another
two
by
two
we
formed
in
line
and
guarded
by
the
attendants
we
went
out
a
back
way
on
to
the
walks
we
had
not
gone
many
paces
when
i
saw
proceeding
from
every
walk
long
lines
of
women
guarded
by
nurses
how
many
there
were
every
way
i
looked
i
could
see
them
in
the
queer
dresses
comical
straw
hats
and
shawls
marching
slowly
around
i
eagerly
watched
the
passing
lines
and
a
thrill
of
horror
crept
over
me
at
the
sight
vacant
eyes
and
meaningless
faces
and
their
tongues
uttered
meaningless
nonsense
one
crowd
passed
and
i
noted
by
nose
as
well
as
eyes
that
they
were
fearfully
dirty
â€œwho
are
theyâ€
i
asked
of
a
patient
near
me
â€œthey
are
considered
the
most
violent
on
the
islandâ€
she
replied
â€œthey
are
from
the
lodge
the
first
building
with
the
high
stepsâ€
some
were
yelling
some
were
cursing
others
were
singing
or
praying
or
preaching
as
the
fancy
struck
them
and
they
made
up
the
most
miserable
collection
of
humanity
i
had
ever
seen
as
the
din
of
their
passing
faded
in
the
distance
there
came
another
sight
i
can
never
forget
a
long
cable
rope
fastened
to
wide
leather
belts
and
these
belts
locked
around
the
waists
of
fifty-two
women
at
the
end
of
the
rope
was
a
heavy
iron
cart
and
in
it
two
womenâ€”one
nursing
a
sore
foot
another
screaming
at
some
nurse
saying
â€œyou
beat
me
and
i
shall
not
forget
it
you
want
to
kill
meâ€
and
then
she
would
sob
and
cry
the
women
â€œon
the
ropeâ€
as
the
patients
call
it
were
each
busy
on
their
individual
freaks
some
were
yelling
all
the
while
one
who
had
blue
eyes
saw
me
look
at
her
and
she
turned
as
far
as
she
could
talking
and
smiling
with
that
terrible
horrifying
look
of
absolute
insanity
stamped
on
her
the
doctors
might
safely
judge
on
her
case
the
horror
of
that
sight
to
one
who
had
never
been
near
an
insane
person
before
was
something
unspeakable
â€œgod
help
themâ€
breathed
miss
neville
â€œit
is
so
dreadful
i
cannot
lookâ€
on
they
passed
but
for
their
places
to
be
filled
by
more
can
you
imagine
the
sight
according
to
one
of
the
physicians
there
are
1600
insane
women
on
blackwellâ€™s
island
mad
what
can
be
half
so
horrible
my
heart
thrilled
with
pity
when
i
looked
on
old
gray-haired
women
talking
aimlessly
to
space
one
woman
had
on
a
straight-jacket
and
two
women
had
to
drag
her
along
crippled
blind
old
young
homely
and
pretty
one
senseless
mass
of
humanity
no
fate
could
be
worse
i
looked
at
the
pretty
lawns
which
i
had
once
thought
was
such
a
comfort
to
the
poor
creatures
confined
on
the
island
and
laughed
at
my
own
notions
what
enjoyment
is
it
to
them
they
are
not
allowed
on
the
grassâ€”it
is
only
to
look
at
i
saw
some
patients
eagerly
and
caressingly
lift
a
nut
or
a
colored
leaf
that
had
fallen
on
the
path
but
they
were
not
permitted
to
keep
them
the
nurses
would
always
compel
them
to
throw
their
little
bit
of
godâ€™s
comfort
away
illustration
quiet
inmates
out
for
a
walk
as
i
passed
a
low
pavilion
where
a
crowd
of
helpless
lunatics
were
confined
i
read
a
motto
on
the
wall
â€œwhile
i
live
i
hopeâ€
the
absurdity
of
it
struck
me
forcibly
i
would
have
liked
to
put
above
the
gates
that
open
to
the
asylum
â€œhe
who
enters
here
leaveth
hope
behindâ€
during
the
walk
i
was
annoyed
a
great
deal
by
nurses
who
had
heard
my
romantic
story
calling
to
those
in
charge
of
us
to
ask
which
one
i
was
i
was
pointed
out
repeatedly
it
was
not
long
until
the
dinner
hour
arrived
and
i
was
so
hungry
that
i
felt
i
could
eat
anything
the
same
old
story
of
standing
for
a
half
and
three-quarters
of
an
hour
in
the
hall
was
repeated
before
we
got
down
to
our
dinners
the
bowls
in
which
we
had
had
our
tea
were
now
filled
with
soup
and
on
a
plate
was
one
cold
boiled
potato
and
a
chunk
of
beef
which
on
investigation
proved
to
be
slightly
spoiled
there
were
no
knives
or
forks
and
the
patients
looked
fairly
savage
as
they
took
the
tough
beef
in
their
fingers
and
pulled
in
opposition
to
their
teeth
those
toothless
or
with
poor
teeth
could
not
eat
it
one
tablespoon
was
given
for
the
soup
and
a
piece
of
bread
was
the
final
entree
butter
is
never
allowed
at
dinner
nor
coffee
or
tea
miss
mayard
could
not
eat
and
i
saw
many
of
the
sick
ones
turn
away
in
disgust
i
was
getting
very
weak
from
the
want
of
food
and
tried
to
eat
a
slice
of
bread
after
the
first
few
bites
hunger
asserted
itself
and
i
was
able
to
eat
all
but
the
crusts
of
the
one
slice
superintendent
dent
went
through
the
sitting-room
giving
an
occasional
â€œhow
do
you
doâ€
â€œhow
are
you
to-dayâ€
here
and
there
among
the
patients
his
voice
was
as
cold
as
the
hall
and
the
patients
made
no
movement
to
tell
him
of
their
sufferings
i
asked
some
of
them
to
tell
how
they
were
suffering
from
the
cold
and
insufficiency
of
clothing
but
they
replied
that
the
nurse
would
beat
them
if
they
told
i
was
never
so
tired
as
i
grew
sitting
on
those
benches
several
of
the
patients
would
sit
on
one
foot
or
sideways
to
make
a
change
but
they
were
always
reproved
and
told
to
sit
up
straight
if
they
talked
they
were
scolded
and
told
to
shut
up
if
they
wanted
to
walk
around
in
order
to
take
the
stiffness
out
of
them
they
were
told
to
sit
down
and
be
still
what
excepting
torture
would
produce
insanity
quicker
than
this
treatment
here
is
a
class
of
women
sent
to
be
cured
i
would
like
the
expert
physicians
who
are
condemning
me
for
my
action
which
has
proven
their
ability
to
take
a
perfectly
sane
and
healthy
woman
shut
her
up
and
make
her
sit
from
6
a
m
until
8
p
m
on
straight-back
benches
do
not
allow
her
to
talk
or
move
during
these
hours
give
her
no
reading
and
let
her
know
nothing
of
the
world
or
its
doings
give
her
bad
food
and
harsh
treatment
and
see
how
long
it
will
take
to
make
her
insane
two
months
would
make
her
a
mental
and
physical
wreck
i
have
described
my
first
day
in
the
asylum
and
as
my
other
nine
were
exactly
the
same
in
the
general
run
of
things
it
would
be
tiresome
to
tell
about
each
in
giving
this
story
i
expect
to
be
contradicted
by
many
who
are
exposed
i
merely
tell
in
common
words
without
exaggeration
of
my
life
in
a
mad-house
for
ten
days
the
eating
was
one
of
the
most
horrible
things
excepting
the
first
two
days
after
i
entered
the
asylum
there
was
no
salt
for
the
food
the
hungry
and
even
famishing
women
made
an
attempt
to
eat
the
horrible
messes
mustard
and
vinegar
were
put
on
meat
and
in
soup
to
give
it
a
taste
but
it
only
helped
to
make
it
worse
even
that
was
all
consumed
after
two
days
and
the
patients
had
to
try
to
choke
down
fresh
fish
just
boiled
in
water
without
salt
pepper
or
butter
mutton
beef
and
potatoes
without
the
faintest
seasoning
the
most
insane
refused
to
swallow
the
food
and
were
threatened
with
punishment
in
our
short
walks
we
passed
the
kitchen
where
food
was
prepared
for
the
nurses
and
doctors
there
we
got
glimpses
of
melons
and
grapes
and
all
kinds
of
fruits
beautiful
white
bread
and
nice
meats
and
the
hungry
feeling
would
be
increased
tenfold
i
spoke
to
some
of
the
physicians
but
it
had
no
effect
and
when
i
was
taken
away
the
food
was
yet
unsalted
my
heart
ached
to
see
the
sick
patients
grow
sicker
over
the
table
i
saw
miss
tillie
mayard
so
suddenly
overcome
at
a
bite
that
she
had
to
rush
from
the
dining-room
and
then
got
a
scolding
for
doing
so
when
the
patients
complained
of
the
food
they
were
told
to
shut
up
that
they
would
not
have
as
good
if
they
were
at
home
and
that
it
was
too
good
for
charity
patients
a
german
girl
louiseâ€”i
have
forgotten
her
last
nameâ€”did
not
eat
for
several
days
and
at
last
one
morning
she
was
missing
from
the
conversation
of
the
nurses
i
found
she
was
suffering
from
a
high
fever
poor
thing
she
told
me
she
unceasingly
prayed
for
death
i
watched
the
nurses
make
a
patient
carry
such
food
as
the
well
ones
were
refusing
up
to
louiseâ€™s
room
think
of
that
stuff
for
a
fever
patient
of
course
she
refused
it
then
i
saw
a
nurse
miss
mccarten
go
to
test
her
temperature
and
she
returned
with
the
report
of
it
being
some
150
degrees
i
smiled
at
the
report
and
miss
grupe
seeing
it
asked
me
how
high
my
temperature
had
ever
run
i
refused
to
answer
miss
grady
then
decided
to
try
her
ability
she
returned
with
the
report
of
99
degrees
miss
tillie
mayard
suffered
more
than
any
of
us
from
the
cold
and
yet
she
tried
to
follow
my
advice
to
be
cheerful
and
try
to
keep
up
for
a
short
time
superintendent
dent
brought
in
a
man
to
see
me
he
felt
my
pulse
and
my
head
and
examined
my
tongue
i
told
them
how
cold
it
was
and
assured
them
that
i
did
not
need
medical
aid
but
that
miss
mayard
did
and
they
should
transfer
their
attentions
to
her
they
did
not
answer
me
and
i
was
pleased
to
see
miss
mayard
leave
her
place
and
come
forward
to
them
she
spoke
to
the
doctors
and
told
them
she
was
ill
but
they
paid
no
attention
to
her
the
nurses
came
and
dragged
her
back
to
the
bench
and
after
the
doctors
left
they
said
â€œafter
awhile
when
you
see
that
the
doctors
will
not
notice
you
you
will
quit
running
up
to
themâ€
before
the
doctors
left
me
i
heard
one
sayâ€”i
cannot
give
it
in
his
exact
wordsâ€”that
my
pulse
and
eyes
were
not
that
of
an
insane
girl
but
superintendent
dent
assured
him
that
in
cases
such
as
mine
such
tests
failed
after
watching
me
for
awhile
he
said
my
face
was
the
brightest
he
had
ever
seen
for
a
lunatic
the
nurses
had
on
heavy
undergarments
and
coats
but
they
refused
to
give
us
shawls
nearly
all
night
long
i
listened
to
a
woman
cry
about
the
cold
and
beg
for
god
to
let
her
die
another
one
yelled
â€œmurderâ€
at
frequent
intervals
and
â€œpoliceâ€
at
others
until
my
flesh
felt
creepy
the
second
morning
after
we
had
begun
our
endless
â€œsetâ€
for
the
day
two
of
the
nurses
assisted
by
some
patients
brought
the
woman
in
who
had
begged
the
night
previous
for
god
to
take
her
home
i
was
not
surprised
at
her
prayer
she
appeared
easily
seventy
years
old
and
she
was
blind
although
the
halls
were
freezing-cold
that
old
woman
had
no
more
clothing
on
than
the
rest
of
us
which
i
have
described
when
she
was
brought
into
the
sitting-room
and
placed
on
the
hard
bench
she
cried
â€œoh
what
are
you
doing
with
me
i
am
cold
so
cold
why
canâ€™t
i
stay
in
bed
or
have
a
shawlâ€
and
then
she
would
get
up
and
endeavor
to
feel
her
way
to
leave
the
room
sometimes
the
attendants
would
jerk
her
back
to
the
bench
and
again
they
would
let
her
walk
and
heartlessly
laugh
when
she
bumped
against
the
table
or
the
edge
of
the
benches
at
one
time
she
said
the
heavy
shoes
which
charity
provides
hurt
her
feet
and
she
took
them
off
the
nurses
made
two
patients
put
them
on
her
again
and
when
she
did
it
several
times
and
fought
against
having
them
on
i
counted
seven
people
at
her
at
once
trying
to
put
the
shoes
on
her
the
old
woman
then
tried
to
lie
down
on
the
bench
but
they
pulled
her
up
again
it
sounded
so
pitiful
to
hear
her
cry
â€œoh
give
me
a
pillow
and
pull
the
covers
over
me
i
am
so
coldâ€
at
this
i
saw
miss
grupe
sit
down
on
her
and
run
her
cold
hands
over
the
old
womanâ€™s
face
and
down
inside
the
neck
of
her
dress
at
the
old
womanâ€™s
cries
she
laughed
savagely
as
did
the
other
nurses
and
repeated
her
cruel
action
that
day
the
old
woman
was
carried
away
to
another
ward
choking
and
beating
patients
miss
tillie
mayard
suffered
greatly
from
cold
one
morning
she
sat
on
the
bench
next
to
me
and
was
livid
with
the
cold
her
limbs
shook
and
her
teeth
chattered
i
spoke
to
the
three
attendants
who
sat
with
coats
on
at
the
table
in
the
center
of
the
floor
â€œit
is
cruel
to
lock
people
up
and
then
freeze
themâ€
i
said
they
replied
she
had
on
as
much
as
any
of
the
rest
and
she
would
get
no
more
just
then
miss
mayard
took
a
fit
and
every
patient
looked
frightened
miss
neville
caught
her
in
her
arms
and
held
her
although
the
nurses
roughly
said
â€œlet
her
fall
on
the
floor
and
it
will
teach
her
a
lessonâ€
miss
neville
told
them
what
she
thought
of
their
actions
and
then
i
got
orders
to
make
my
appearance
in
the
office
just
as
i
reached
there
superintendent
dent
came
to
the
door
and
i
told
him
how
we
were
suffering
from
the
cold
and
of
miss
mayardâ€™s
condition
doubtless
i
spoke
incoherently
for
i
told
of
the
state
of
the
food
the
treatment
of
the
nurses
and
their
refusal
to
give
more
clothing
the
condition
of
miss
mayard
and
the
nurses
telling
us
because
the
asylum
was
a
public
institution
we
could
not
expect
even
kindness
assuring
him
that
i
needed
no
medical
aid
i
told
him
to
go
to
miss
mayard
he
did
so
from
miss
neville
and
other
patients
i
learned
what
transpired
miss
mayard
was
still
in
the
fit
and
he
caught
her
roughly
between
the
eyebrows
or
thereabouts
and
pinched
until
her
face
was
crimson
from
the
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
and
her
senses
returned
all
day
afterward
she
suffered
from
terrible
headache
and
from
that
on
she
grew
worse
insane
yes
insane
and
as
i
watched
the
insanity
slowly
creep
over
the
mind
that
had
appeared
to
be
all
right
i
secretly
cursed
the
doctors
the
nurses
and
all
public
institutions
some
one
may
say
that
she
was
insane
at
some
time
previous
to
her
consignment
to
the
asylum
then
if
she
were
was
this
the
proper
place
to
send
a
woman
just
convalescing
to
be
given
cold
baths
deprived
of
sufficient
clothing
and
fed
with
horrible
food
on
this
morning
i
had
a
long
conversation
with
dr
ingram
the
assistant
superintendent
of
the
asylum
i
found
that
he
was
kind
to
the
helpless
beings
in
his
charge
i
began
my
old
complaint
of
the
cold
and
he
called
miss
grady
to
the
office
and
ordered
more
clothing
given
the
patients
miss
grady
said
if
i
made
a
practice
of
telling
it
would
be
a
serious
thing
for
me
she
warned
me
in
time
many
visitors
looking
for
missing
girls
came
to
see
me
miss
grady
yelled
in
the
door
from
the
hall
one
day
â€œnellie
brown
youâ€™re
wantedâ€
i
went
to
the
sitting-room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
there
sat
a
gentleman
who
had
known
me
intimately
for
years
i
saw
by
the
sudden
blanching
of
his
face
and
his
inability
to
speak
that
the
sight
of
me
was
wholly
unexpected
and
had
shocked
him
terribly
in
an
instant
i
determined
if
he
betrayed
me
as
nellie
bly
to
say
i
had
never
seen
him
before
however
i
had
one
card
to
play
and
i
risked
it
with
miss
grady
within
touching
distance
i
whispered
hurriedly
to
him
in
language
more
expressive
than
elegant
â€œdonâ€™t
give
me
awayâ€
i
knew
by
the
expression
of
his
eye
that
he
understood
so
i
said
to
miss
grady
â€œi
do
not
know
this
manâ€
â€œdo
you
know
herâ€
asked
miss
grady
â€œno
this
is
not
the
young
lady
i
came
in
search
ofâ€
he
replied
in
a
strained
voice
â€œif
you
do
not
know
her
you
cannot
stay
hereâ€
she
said
and
she
took
him
to
the
door
all
at
once
a
fear
struck
me
that
he
would
think
i
had
been
sent
there
through
some
mistake
and
would
tell
my
friends
and
make
an
effort
to
have
me
released
so
i
waited
until
miss
grady
had
the
door
unlocked
i
knew
that
she
would
have
to
lock
it
before
she
could
leave
and
the
time
required
to
do
so
would
give
me
opportunity
to
speak
so
i
called
â€œone
moment
senorâ€
he
returned
to
me
and
i
asked
aloud
â€œdo
you
speak
spanish
senorâ€
and
then
whispered
â€œitâ€™s
all
right
iâ€™m
after
an
item
keep
stillâ€
â€œnoâ€
he
said
with
a
peculiar
emphasis
which
i
knew
meant
that
he
would
keep
my
secret
people
in
the
world
can
never
imagine
the
length
of
days
to
those
in
asylums
they
seemed
never
ending
and
we
welcomed
any
event
that
might
give
us
something
to
think
about
as
well
as
talk
of
there
is
nothing
to
read
and
the
only
bit
of
talk
that
never
wears
out
is
conjuring
up
delicate
food
that
they
will
get
as
soon
as
they
get
out
anxiously
the
hour
was
watched
for
when
the
boat
arrived
to
see
if
there
were
any
new
unfortunates
to
be
added
to
our
ranks
when
they
came
and
were
ushered
into
the
sitting-room
the
patients
would
express
sympathy
to
one
another
for
them
and
were
anxious
to
show
them
little
marks
of
attention
hall
6
was
the
receiving
hall
so
that
was
how
we
saw
all
newcomers
soon
after
my
advent
a
girl
called
urena
little-page
was
brought
in
she
was
as
she
had
been
born
silly
and
her
tender
spot
was
as
with
many
sensible
women
her
age
she
claimed
eighteen
and
would
grow
very
angry
if
told
to
the
contrary
the
nurses
were
not
long
in
finding
this
out
and
then
they
teased
her
â€œurenaâ€
said
miss
grady
â€œthe
doctors
say
that
you
are
thirty-three
instead
of
eighteenâ€
and
the
other
nurses
laughed
they
kept
up
this
until
the
simple
creature
began
to
yell
and
cry
saying
she
wanted
to
go
home
and
that
everybody
treated
her
badly
after
they
had
gotten
all
the
amusement
out
of
her
they
wanted
and
she
was
crying
they
began
to
scold
and
tell
her
to
keep
quiet
she
grew
more
hysterical
every
moment
until
they
pounced
upon
her
and
slapped
her
face
and
knocked
her
head
in
a
lively
fashion
this
made
the
poor
creature
cry
the
more
and
so
they
choked
her
yes
actually
choked
her
then
they
dragged
her
out
to
the
closet
and
i
heard
her
terrified
cries
hush
into
smothered
ones
after
several
hoursâ€™
absence
she
returned
to
the
sitting-room
and
i
plainly
saw
the
marks
of
their
fingers
on
her
throat
for
the
entire
day
this
punishment
seemed
to
awaken
their
desire
to
administer
more
they
returned
to
the
sitting-room
and
caught
hold
of
an
old
gray-haired
woman
whom
i
have
heard
addressed
both
as
mrs
grady
and
mrs
oâ€™keefe
she
was
insane
and
she
talked
almost
continually
to
herself
and
to
those
near
her
she
never
spoke
very
loud
and
at
the
time
i
speak
of
was
sitting
harmlessly
chattering
to
herself
they
grabbed
her
and
my
heart
ached
as
she
cried
â€œfor
god
sake
ladies
donâ€™t
let
them
beat
meâ€
â€œshut
up
you
hussyâ€
said
miss
grady
as
she
caught
the
woman
by
her
gray
hair
and
dragged
her
shrieking
and
pleading
from
the
room
she
was
also
taken
to
the
closet
and
her
cries
grew
lower
and
lower
and
then
ceased
the
nurses
returned
to
the
room
and
miss
grady
remarked
that
she
had
â€œsettled
the
old
fool
for
awhileâ€
i
told
some
of
the
physicians
of
the
occurrence
but
they
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
it
one
of
the
characters
in
hall
6
was
matilda
a
little
old
german
woman
who
i
believe
went
insane
over
the
loss
of
money
she
was
small
and
had
a
pretty
pink
complexion
she
was
not
much
trouble
except
at
times
she
would
take
spells
when
she
would
talk
into
the
steam-heaters
or
get
up
on
a
chair
and
talk
out
of
the
windows
in
these
conversations
she
railed
at
the
lawyers
who
had
taken
her
property
the
nurses
seemed
to
find
a
great
deal
of
amusement
in
teasing
the
harmless
old
soul
one
day
i
sat
beside
miss
grady
and
miss
grupe
and
heard
them
tell
her
perfectly
vile
things
to
call
miss
mccarten
after
telling
her
to
say
these
things
they
would
send
her
to
the
other
nurse
but
matilda
proved
that
she
even
in
her
state
had
more
sense
than
they
â€œi
cannot
tell
you
it
is
privateâ€
was
all
she
would
say
i
saw
miss
grady
on
a
pretense
of
whispering
to
her
spit
in
her
ear
matilda
quietly
wiped
her
ear
and
said
nothing
some
unfortunate
stories
by
this
time
i
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
greater
number
of
the
forty-five
women
in
hall
6
let
me
introduce
a
few
louise
the
pretty
german
girl
whom
i
have
spoken
of
formerly
as
being
sick
with
fever
had
the
delusion
that
the
spirits
of
her
dead
parents
were
with
her
â€œi
have
gotten
many
beatings
from
miss
grady
and
her
assistantsâ€
she
said
â€œand
i
am
unable
to
eat
the
horrible
food
they
give
us
i
ought
not
to
be
compelled
to
freeze
for
want
of
proper
clothing
oh
i
pray
nightly
that
i
may
be
taken
to
my
papa
and
mamma
one
night
when
i
was
confined
at
bellevue
dr
field
came
i
was
in
bed
and
weary
of
the
examination
at
last
i
said
â€˜i
am
tired
of
this
i
will
talk
no
moreâ€™
â€˜wonâ€™t
youâ€™
he
said
angrily
â€˜iâ€™ll
see
if
i
canâ€™t
make
youâ€™
with
this
he
laid
his
crutch
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
getting
up
on
it
he
pinched
me
very
severely
in
the
ribs
i
jumped
up
straight
in
bed
and
said
â€˜what
do
you
mean
by
thisâ€™
â€˜i
want
to
teach
you
to
obey
when
i
speak
to
youâ€™
he
replied
if
i
could
only
die
and
go
to
papaâ€
when
i
left
she
was
confined
to
bed
with
a
fever
and
maybe
by
this
time
she
has
her
wish
there
is
a
frenchwoman
confined
in
hall
6
or
was
during
my
stay
whom
i
firmly
believe
to
be
perfectly
sane
i
watched
her
and
talked
with
her
every
day
excepting
the
last
three
and
i
was
unable
to
find
any
delusion
or
mania
in
her
her
name
is
josephine
despreau
if
that
is
spelled
correctly
and
her
husband
and
all
her
friends
are
in
france
josephine
feels
her
position
keenly
her
lips
tremble
and
she
breaks
down
crying
when
she
talks
of
her
helpless
condition
â€œhow
did
you
get
hereâ€
i
asked
â€œone
morning
as
i
was
trying
to
get
breakfast
i
grew
deathly
sick
and
two
officers
were
called
in
by
the
woman
of
the
house
and
i
was
taken
to
the
station-house
i
was
unable
to
understand
their
proceedings
and
they
paid
little
attention
to
my
story
doings
in
this
country
were
new
to
me
and
before
i
realized
it
i
was
lodged
as
an
insane
woman
in
this
asylum
when
i
first
came
i
cried
that
i
was
here
without
hope
of
release
and
for
crying
miss
grady
and
her
assistants
choked
me
until
they
hurt
my
throat
for
it
has
been
sore
ever
sinceâ€
a
pretty
young
hebrew
woman
spoke
so
little
english
i
could
not
get
her
story
except
as
told
by
the
nurses
they
said
her
name
is
sarah
fishbaum
and
that
her
husband
put
her
in
the
asylum
because
she
had
a
fondness
for
other
men
than
himself
granting
that
sarah
was
insane
and
about
men
let
me
tell
you
how
the
nurses
tried
to
cure
her
they
would
call
her
up
and
say
â€œsarah
wouldnâ€™t
you
like
to
have
a
nice
young
manâ€
â€œoh
yes
a
young
man
is
all
rightâ€
sarah
would
reply
in
her
few
english
words
â€œwell
sarah
wouldnâ€™t
you
like
us
to
speak
a
good
word
to
some
of
the
doctors
for
you
wouldnâ€™t
you
like
to
have
one
of
the
doctorsâ€
and
then
they
would
ask
her
which
doctor
she
preferred
and
advise
her
to
make
advances
to
him
when
he
visited
the
hall
and
so
on
i
had
been
watching
and
talking
with
a
fair-complexioned
woman
for
several
days
and
i
was
at
a
loss
to
see
why
she
had
been
sent
there
she
was
so
sane
â€œwhy
did
you
come
hereâ€
i
asked
her
one
day
after
we
had
indulged
in
a
long
conversation
â€œi
was
sickâ€
she
replied
â€œare
you
sick
mentallyâ€
i
urged
â€œoh
no
what
gave
you
such
an
idea
i
had
been
overworking
myself
and
i
broke
down
having
some
family
trouble
and
being
penniless
and
nowhere
to
go
i
applied
to
the
commissioners
to
be
sent
to
the
poorhouse
until
i
would
be
able
to
go
to
workâ€
â€œbut
they
do
not
send
poor
people
here
unless
they
are
insaneâ€
i
said
â€œdonâ€™t
you
know
there
are
only
insane
women
or
those
supposed
to
be
so
sent
hereâ€
â€œi
knew
after
i
got
here
that
the
majority
of
these
women
were
insane
but
then
i
believed
them
when
they
told
me
this
was
the
place
they
sent
all
the
poor
who
applied
for
aid
as
i
had
doneâ€
â€œhow
have
you
been
treatedâ€
i
asked
â€œwell
so
far
i
have
escaped
a
beating
although
i
have
been
sickened
at
the
sight
of
many
and
the
recital
of
more
when
i
was
brought
here
they
went
to
give
me
a
bath
and
the
very
disease
for
which
i
needed
doctoring
and
from
which
i
was
suffering
made
it
necessary
that
i
should
not
bathe
but
they
put
me
in
and
my
sufferings
were
increased
greatly
for
weeks
thereafterâ€
a
mrs
mccartney
whose
husband
is
a
tailor
seems
perfectly
rational
and
has
not
one
fancy
mary
hughes
and
mrs
louise
schanz
showed
no
obvious
traces
of
insanity
one
day
two
newcomers
were
added
to
our
list
the
one
was
an
idiot
carrie
glass
and
the
other
was
a
nice-looking
german
girlâ€”quite
young
she
seemed
and
when
she
came
in
all
the
patients
spoke
of
her
nice
appearance
and
apparent
sanity
her
name
was
margaret
she
told
me
she
had
been
a
cook
and
was
extremely
neat
one
day
after
she
had
scrubbed
the
kitchen
floor
the
chambermaids
came
down
and
deliberately
soiled
it
her
temper
was
aroused
and
she
began
to
quarrel
with
them
an
officer
was
called
and
she
was
taken
to
an
asylum
â€œhow
can
they
say
i
am
insane
merely
because
i
allowed
my
temper
to
run
away
with
meâ€
she
complained
â€œother
people
are
not
shut
up
for
crazy
when
they
get
angry
i
suppose
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
keep
quiet
and
so
avoid
the
beatings
which
i
see
others
get
no
one
can
say
one
word
about
me
i
do
everything
i
am
told
and
all
the
work
they
give
me
i
am
obedient
in
every
respect
and
i
do
everything
to
prove
to
them
that
i
am
saneâ€
one
day
an
insane
woman
was
brought
in
she
was
noisy
and
miss
grady
gave
her
a
beating
and
blacked
her
eye
when
the
doctors
noticed
it
and
asked
if
it
was
done
before
she
came
there
the
nurses
said
it
was
while
i
was
in
hall
6
i
never
heard
the
nurses
address
the
patients
except
to
scold
or
yell
at
them
unless
it
was
to
tease
them
they
spent
much
of
their
time
gossiping
about
the
physicians
and
about
the
other
nurses
in
a
manner
that
was
not
elevating
miss
grady
nearly
always
interspersed
her
conversation
with
profane
language
and
generally
began
her
sentences
by
calling
on
the
name
of
the
lord
the
names
she
called
the
patients
were
of
the
lowest
and
most
profane
type
one
evening
she
quarreled
with
another
nurse
while
we
were
at
supper
about
the
bread
and
when
the
nurse
had
gone
out
she
called
her
bad
names
and
made
ugly
remarks
about
her
in
the
evenings
a
woman
whom
i
supposed
to
be
head
cook
for
the
doctors
used
to
come
up
and
bring
raisins
grapes
apples
and
crackers
to
the
nurses
imagine
the
feelings
of
the
hungry
patients
as
they
sat
and
watched
the
nurses
eat
what
was
to
them
a
dream
of
luxury
one
afternoon
dr
dent
was
talking
to
a
patient
mrs
turney
about
some
trouble
she
had
had
with
a
nurse
or
matron
a
short
time
after
we
were
taken
down
to
supper
and
this
woman
who
had
beaten
mrs
turney
and
of
whom
dr
dent
spoke
was
sitting
at
the
door
of
our
dining-room
suddenly
mrs
turney
picked
up
her
bowl
of
tea
and
rushing
out
of
the
door
flung
it
at
the
woman
who
had
beat
her
there
was
some
loud
screaming
and
mrs
turney
was
returned
to
her
place
the
next
day
she
was
transferred
to
the
â€œrope
gangâ€
which
is
supposed
to
be
composed
of
the
most
dangerous
and
most
suicidal
women
on
the
island
at
first
i
could
not
sleep
and
did
not
want
to
so
long
as
i
could
hear
anything
new
the
night
nurses
may
have
complained
of
the
fact
at
any
rate
one
night
they
came
in
and
tried
to
make
me
take
a
dose
of
some
mixture
out
of
a
glass
â€œto
make
me
sleepâ€
they
said
i
told
them
i
would
do
nothing
of
the
sort
and
they
left
me
i
hoped
for
the
night
my
hopes
were
vain
for
in
a
few
minutes
they
returned
with
a
doctor
the
same
that
received
us
on
our
arrival
he
insisted
that
i
take
it
but
i
was
determined
not
to
lose
my
wits
even
for
a
few
hours
when
he
saw
i
was
not
to
be
coaxed
he
grew
rather
rough
and
said
he
had
wasted
too
much
time
with
me
already
that
if
i
did
not
take
it
he
would
put
it
into
my
arm
with
a
needle
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
he
put
it
into
my
arm
i
could
not
get
rid
of
it
but
if
i
swallowed
it
there
was
one
hope
so
i
said
i
would
take
it
i
smelt
it
and
it
smelt
like
laudanum
and
it
was
a
horrible
dose
no
sooner
had
they
left
the
room
and
locked
me
in
than
i
tried
to
see
how
far
down
my
throat
my
finger
would
go
and
the
chloral
was
allowed
to
try
its
effect
elsewhere
i
want
to
say
that
the
night
nurse
burns
in
hall
6
seemed
very
kind
and
patient
to
the
poor
afflicted
people
the
other
nurses
made
several
attempts
to
talk
to
me
about
lovers
and
asked
me
if
i
would
not
like
to
have
one
they
did
not
find
me
very
communicative
on
theâ€”to
themâ€”popular
subject
once
a
week
the
patients
are
given
a
bath
and
that
is
the
only
time
they
see
soap
a
patient
handed
me
a
piece
of
soap
one
day
about
the
size
of
a
thimble
i
considered
it
a
great
compliment
in
her
wanting
to
be
kind
but
i
thought
she
would
appreciate
the
cheap
soap
more
than
i
so
i
thanked
her
but
refused
to
take
it
on
bathing
day
the
tub
is
filled
with
water
and
the
patients
are
washed
one
after
the
other
without
a
change
of
water
this
is
done
until
the
water
is
really
thick
and
then
it
is
allowed
to
run
out
and
the
tub
is
refilled
without
being
washed
the
same
towels
are
used
on
all
the
women
those
with
eruptions
as
well
as
those
without
the
healthy
patients
fight
for
a
change
of
water
but
they
are
compelled
to
submit
to
the
dictates
of
the
lazy
tyrannical
nurses
the
dresses
are
seldom
changed
oftener
than
once
a
month
if
the
patient
has
a
visitor
i
have
seen
the
nurses
hurry
her
out
and
change
her
dress
before
the
visitor
comes
in
this
keeps
up
the
appearance
of
careful
and
good
management
the
patients
who
are
not
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
get
into
beastly
conditions
and
the
nurses
never
look
after
them
but
order
some
of
the
patients
to
do
so
for
five
days
we
were
compelled
to
sit
in
the
room
all
day
i
never
put
in
such
a
long
time
every
patient
was
stiff
and
sore
and
tired
we
would
get
in
little
groups
on
benches
and
torture
our
stomachs
by
conjuring
up
thoughts
of
what
we
would
eat
first
when
we
got
out
if
i
had
not
known
how
hungry
they
were
and
the
pitiful
side
of
it
the
conversation
would
have
been
very
amusing
as
it
was
it
only
made
me
sad
when
the
subject
of
eating
which
seemed
to
be
the
favorite
one
was
worn
out
they
used
to
give
their
opinions
of
the
institution
and
its
management
the
condemnation
of
the
nurses
and
the
eatables
was
unanimous
as
the
days
passed
miss
tillie
mayardâ€™s
condition
grew
worse
she
was
continually
cold
and
unable
to
eat
of
the
food
provided
day
after
day
she
sang
in
order
to
try
to
maintain
her
memory
but
at
last
the
nurse
made
her
stop
it
i
talked
with
her
daily
and
i
grieved
to
find
her
grow
worse
so
rapidly
at
last
she
got
a
delusion
she
thought
that
i
was
trying
to
pass
myself
off
for
her
and
that
all
the
people
who
called
to
see
nellie
brown
were
friends
in
search
of
her
but
that
i
by
some
means
was
trying
to
deceive
them
into
the
belief
that
i
was
the
girl
i
tried
to
reason
with
her
but
found
it
impossible
so
i
kept
away
from
her
as
much
as
possible
lest
my
presence
should
make
her
worse
and
feed
the
fancy
one
of
the
patients
mrs
cotter
a
pretty
delicate
woman
one
day
thought
she
saw
her
husband
coming
up
the
walk
she
left
the
line
in
which
she
was
marching
and
ran
to
meet
him
for
this
act
she
was
sent
to
the
retreat
she
afterward
said
â€œthe
remembrance
of
that
is
enough
to
make
me
mad
for
crying
the
nurses
beat
me
with
a
broom-handle
and
jumped
on
me
injuring
me
internally
so
that
i
shall
never
get
over
it
then
they
tied
my
hands
and
feet
and
throwing
a
sheet
over
my
head
twisted
it
tightly
around
my
throat
so
i
could
not
scream
and
thus
put
me
in
a
bathtub
filled
with
cold
water
they
held
me
under
until
i
gave
up
every
hope
and
became
senseless
at
other
times
they
took
hold
of
my
ears
and
beat
my
head
on
the
floor
and
against
the
wall
then
they
pulled
my
hair
out
by
the
roots
so
that
it
will
never
grow
in
againâ€
mrs
cotter
here
showed
me
proofs
of
her
story
the
dent
in
the
back
of
her
head
and
the
bare
spots
where
the
hair
had
been
taken
out
by
the
handful
i
give
her
story
as
plainly
as
possible
â€œmy
treatment
was
not
as
bad
as
i
have
seen
others
get
in
there
but
it
has
ruined
my
health
and
even
if
i
do
get
out
of
here
i
will
be
a
wreck
when
my
husband
heard
of
the
treatment
given
me
he
threatened
to
expose
the
place
if
i
was
not
removed
so
i
was
brought
here
i
am
well
mentally
now
all
that
old
fear
has
left
me
and
the
doctor
has
promised
to
allow
my
husband
to
take
me
homeâ€
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
bridget
mcguinness
who
seems
to
be
sane
at
the
present
time
she
said
she
was
sent
to
retreat
4
and
put
on
the
â€œrope
gangâ€
â€œthe
beatings
i
got
there
were
something
dreadful
i
was
pulled
around
by
the
hair
held
under
the
water
until
i
strangled
and
i
was
choked
and
kicked
the
nurses
would
always
keep
a
quiet
patient
stationed
at
the
window
to
tell
them
when
any
of
the
doctors
were
approaching
it
was
hopeless
to
complain
to
the
doctors
for
they
always
said
it
was
the
imagination
of
our
diseased
brains
and
besides
we
would
get
another
beating
for
telling
they
would
hold
patients
under
the
water
and
threaten
to
leave
them
to
die
there
if
they
did
not
promise
not
to
tell
the
doctors
we
would
all
promise
because
we
knew
the
doctors
would
not
help
us
and
we
would
do
anything
to
escape
the
punishment
after
breaking
a
window
i
was
transferred
to
the
lodge
the
worst
place
on
the
island
it
is
dreadfully
dirty
in
there
and
the
stench
is
awful
in
the
summer
the
flies
swarm
the
place
the
food
is
worse
than
we
get
in
other
wards
and
we
are
given
only
tin
plates
instead
of
the
bars
being
on
the
outside
as
in
this
ward
they
are
on
the
inside
there
are
many
quiet
patients
there
who
have
been
there
for
years
but
the
nurses
keep
them
to
do
the
work
among
other
beatings
i
got
there
the
nurses
jumped
on
me
once
and
broke
two
of
my
ribs
â€œwhile
i
was
there
a
pretty
young
girl
was
brought
in
she
had
been
sick
and
she
fought
against
being
put
in
that
dirty
place
one
night
the
nurses
took
her
and
after
beating
her
they
held
her
naked
in
a
cold
bath
then
they
threw
her
on
her
bed
when
morning
came
the
girl
was
dead
the
doctors
said
she
died
of
convulsions
and
that
was
all
that
was
done
about
it
â€œthey
inject
so
much
morphine
and
chloral
that
the
patients
are
made
crazy
i
have
seen
the
patients
wild
for
water
from
the
effect
of
the
drugs
and
the
nurses
would
refuse
it
to
them
i
have
heard
women
beg
for
a
whole
night
for
one
drop
and
it
was
not
given
them
i
myself
cried
for
water
until
my
mouth
was
so
parched
and
dry
that
i
could
not
speakâ€
i
saw
the
same
thing
myself
in
hall
7
the
patients
would
beg
for
a
drink
before
retiring
but
the
nursesâ€”miss
hart
and
the
othersâ€”refused
to
unlock
the
bathroom
that
they
might
quench
their
thirst
incidents
of
asylum
life
there
is
little
in
the
wards
to
help
one
pass
the
time
all
the
asylum
clothing
is
made
by
the
patients
but
sewing
does
not
employ
oneâ€™s
mind
after
several
monthsâ€™
confinement
the
thoughts
of
the
busy
world
grow
faint
and
all
the
poor
prisoners
can
do
is
to
sit
and
ponder
over
their
hopeless
fate
in
the
upper
halls
a
good
view
is
obtained
of
the
passing
boats
and
new
york
often
i
tried
to
picture
to
myself
as
i
looked
out
between
the
bars
to
the
lights
faintly
glimmering
in
the
city
what
my
feelings
would
be
if
i
had
no
one
to
obtain
my
release
i
have
watched
patients
stand
and
gaze
longingly
toward
the
city
they
in
all
likelihood
will
never
enter
again
it
means
liberty
and
life
it
seems
so
near
and
yet
heaven
is
not
further
from
hell
do
the
women
pine
for
home
excepting
the
most
violent
cases
they
are
conscious
that
they
are
confined
in
an
asylum
an
only
desire
that
never
dies
is
the
one
for
release
for
home
one
poor
girl
used
to
tell
me
every
morning
â€œi
dreamed
of
my
mother
last
night
i
think
she
may
come
to-day
and
take
me
homeâ€
that
one
thought
that
longing
is
always
present
yet
she
has
been
confined
some
four
years
what
a
mysterious
thing
madness
is
i
have
watched
patients
whose
lips
are
forever
sealed
in
a
perpetual
silence
they
live
breathe
eat
the
human
form
is
there
but
that
something
which
the
body
can
live
without
but
which
cannot
exist
without
the
body
was
missing
i
have
wondered
if
behind
those
sealed
lips
there
were
dreams
we
ken
not
of
or
if
all
was
blank
still
as
sad
are
those
cases
when
the
patients
are
always
conversing
with
invisible
parties
i
have
seen
them
wholly
unconscious
of
their
surroundings
and
engrossed
with
an
invisible
being
yet
strange
to
say
that
any
command
issued
to
them
is
always
obeyed
in
about
the
same
manner
as
a
dog
obeys
his
master
one
of
the
most
pitiful
delusions
of
any
of
the
patients
was
that
of
a
blue-eyed
irish
girl
who
believed
she
was
forever
damned
because
of
one
act
in
her
life
her
horrible
cry
morning
and
night
â€œi
am
damned
for
all
eternityâ€
would
strike
horror
to
my
soul
her
agony
seemed
like
a
glimpse
of
the
inferno
after
being
transferred
to
hall
7
i
was
locked
in
a
room
every
night
with
six
crazy
women
two
of
them
seemed
never
to
sleep
but
spent
the
night
in
raving
one
would
get
out
of
her
bed
and
creep
around
the
room
searching
for
some
one
she
wanted
to
kill
i
could
not
help
but
think
how
easy
it
would
be
for
her
to
attack
any
of
the
other
patients
confined
with
her
it
did
not
make
the
night
more
comfortable
one
middle-aged
woman
who
used
to
sit
always
in
the
corner
of
the
room
was
very
strangely
affected
she
had
a
piece
of
newspaper
and
from
it
she
continually
read
the
most
wonderful
things
i
ever
heard
i
often
sat
close
by
her
and
listened
history
and
romance
fell
equally
well
from
her
lips
i
saw
but
one
letter
given
a
patient
while
i
was
there
it
awakened
a
big
interest
every
patient
seemed
thirsty
for
a
word
from
the
world
and
they
crowded
around
the
one
who
had
been
so
fortunate
and
asked
hundreds
of
questions
visitors
make
but
little
interest
and
a
great
deal
of
mirth
miss
mattie
morgan
in
hall
7
played
for
the
entertainment
of
some
visitors
one
day
they
were
close
about
her
until
one
whispered
that
she
was
a
patient
â€œcrazyâ€
they
whispered
audibly
as
they
fell
back
and
left
her
alone
she
was
amused
as
well
as
indignant
over
the
episode
miss
mattie
assisted
by
several
girls
she
has
trained
makes
the
evenings
pass
very
pleasantly
in
hall
7
they
sing
and
dance
often
the
doctors
come
up
and
dance
with
the
patients
one
day
when
we
went
down
to
dinner
we
heard
a
weak
little
cry
in
the
basement
every
one
seemed
to
notice
it
and
it
was
not
long
until
we
knew
there
was
a
baby
down
there
yes
a
baby
think
of
itâ€”a
little
innocent
babe
born
in
such
a
chamber
of
horrors
i
can
imagine
nothing
more
terrible
a
visitor
who
came
one
day
brought
in
her
arms
her
babe
a
mother
who
had
been
separated
from
her
five
little
children
asked
permission
to
hold
it
when
the
visitor
wanted
to
leave
the
womanâ€™s
grief
was
uncontrollable
as
she
begged
to
keep
the
babe
which
she
imagined
was
her
own
it
excited
more
patients
than
i
had
ever
seen
excited
before
at
one
time
the
only
amusement
if
so
it
may
be
called
given
the
patients
outside
is
a
ride
once
a
week
if
the
weather
permits
on
the
â€œmerry-go-roundâ€
it
is
a
change
and
so
they
accept
it
with
some
show
of
pleasure
a
scrub-brush
factory
a
mat
factory
and
the
laundry
are
where
the
mild
patients
work
they
get
no
recompense
for
it
but
they
get
hungry
over
it
the
last
good-bye
the
day
pauline
moser
was
brought
to
the
asylum
we
heard
the
most
horrible
screams
and
an
irish
girl
only
partly
dressed
came
staggering
like
a
drunken
person
up
the
hall
yelling
â€œhurrah
three
cheers
i
have
killed
the
divil
lucifer
lucifer
luciferâ€
and
so
on
over
and
over
again
then
she
would
pull
a
handful
of
hair
out
while
she
exultingly
cried
â€œhow
i
deceived
the
divils
they
always
said
god
made
hell
but
he
didnâ€™tâ€
pauline
helped
the
girl
to
make
the
place
hideous
by
singing
the
most
horrible
songs
after
the
irish
girl
had
been
there
an
hour
or
so
dr
dent
came
in
and
as
he
walked
down
the
hall
miss
grupe
whispered
to
the
demented
girl
â€œhere
is
the
devil
coming
go
for
himâ€
surprised
that
she
would
give
a
mad
woman
such
instructions
i
fully
expected
to
see
the
frenzied
creature
rush
at
the
doctor
luckily
she
did
not
but
commenced
to
repeat
her
refrain
of
â€œoh
luciferâ€
after
the
doctor
left
miss
grupe
again
tried
to
excite
the
woman
by
saying
the
pictured
minstrel
on
the
wall
was
the
devil
and
the
poor
creature
began
to
scream
â€œyou
divil
iâ€™ll
give
it
to
youâ€
so
that
two
nurses
had
to
sit
on
her
to
keep
her
down
the
attendants
seemed
to
find
amusement
and
pleasure
in
exciting
the
violent
patients
to
do
their
worst
i
always
made
a
point
of
telling
the
doctors
i
was
sane
and
asking
to
be
released
but
the
more
i
endeavored
to
assure
them
of
my
sanity
the
more
they
doubted
it
â€œwhat
are
you
doctors
here
forâ€
i
asked
one
whose
name
i
cannot
recall
â€œto
take
care
of
the
patients
and
test
their
sanityâ€
he
replied
â€œvery
wellâ€
i
said
â€œthere
are
sixteen
doctors
on
this
island
and
excepting
two
i
have
never
seen
them
pay
any
attention
to
the
patients
how
can
a
doctor
judge
a
womanâ€™s
sanity
by
merely
bidding
her
good
morning
and
refusing
to
hear
her
pleas
for
release
even
the
sick
ones
know
it
is
useless
to
say
anything
for
the
answer
will
be
that
it
is
their
imaginationâ€
â€œtry
every
test
on
meâ€
i
have
urged
others
â€œand
tell
me
am
i
sane
or
insane
try
my
pulse
my
heart
my
eyes
ask
me
to
stretch
out
my
arm
to
work
my
fingers
as
dr
field
did
at
bellevue
and
then
tell
me
if
i
am
saneâ€
they
would
not
heed
me
for
they
thought
i
raved
again
i
said
to
one
â€œyou
have
no
right
to
keep
sane
people
here
i
am
sane
have
always
been
so
and
i
must
insist
on
a
thorough
examination
or
be
released
several
of
the
women
here
are
also
sane
why
canâ€™t
they
be
freeâ€
â€œthey
are
insaneâ€
was
the
reply
â€œand
suffering
from
delusionsâ€
after
a
long
talk
with
dr
ingram
he
said
â€œi
will
transfer
you
to
a
quieter
wardâ€
an
hour
later
miss
grady
called
me
into
the
hall
and
after
calling
me
all
the
vile
and
profane
names
a
woman
could
ever
remember
she
told
me
that
it
was
a
lucky
thing
for
my
â€œhideâ€
that
i
was
transferred
or
else
she
would
pay
me
for
remembering
so
well
to
tell
dr
ingram
everything
â€œyou
dâ€”n
hussy
you
forget
all
about
yourself
but
you
never
forget
anything
to
tell
the
doctorâ€
after
calling
miss
neville
whom
dr
ingram
also
kindly
transferred
miss
grady
took
us
to
the
hall
above
no

illustration
insane
hall
no

in
hall
7
there
are
mrs
kroener
miss
fitzpatrick
miss
finney
and
miss
hart
i
did
not
see
as
cruel
treatment
as
down-stairs
but
i
heard
them
make
ugly
remarks
and
threats
twist
the
fingers
and
slap
the
faces
of
the
unruly
patients
the
night
nurse
conway
i
believe
her
name
is
is
very
cross
in
hall
7
if
any
of
the
patients
possessed
any
modesty
they
soon
lost
it
every
one
was
compelled
to
undress
in
the
hall
before
their
own
door
and
to
fold
their
clothes
and
leave
them
there
until
morning
i
asked
to
undress
in
my
room
but
miss
conway
told
me
if
she
ever
caught
me
at
such
a
trick
she
would
give
me
cause
not
to
want
to
repeat
it
the
first
doctor
i
saw
hereâ€”dr
caldwellâ€”chucked
me
under
the
chin
and
as
i
was
tired
refusing
to
tell
where
my
home
was
i
would
only
speak
to
him
in
spanish
hall
7
looks
rather
nice
to
a
casual
visitor
it
is
hung
with
cheap
pictures
and
has
a
piano
which
is
presided
over
by
miss
mattie
morgan
who
formerly
was
in
a
music
store
in
this
city
she
has
been
in
the
asylum
for
three
years
miss
mattie
has
been
training
several
of
the
patients
to
sing
with
some
show
of
success
the
artiste
of
the
hall
is
under
pronounced
wanda
a
polish
girl
she
is
a
gifted
pianist
when
she
chooses
to
display
her
ability
the
most
difficult
music
she
reads
at
a
glance
and
her
touch
and
expression
are
perfect
on
sunday
the
quieter
patients
whose
names
have
been
handed
in
by
the
attendants
during
the
week
are
allowed
to
go
to
church
a
small
catholic
chapel
is
on
the
island
and
other
services
are
also
held
a
â€œcommissionerâ€
came
one
day
and
made
the
rounds
with
dr
dent
in
the
basement
they
found
half
the
nurses
gone
to
dinner
leaving
the
other
half
in
charge
of
us
as
was
always
done
immediately
orders
were
given
to
bring
the
nurses
back
to
their
duties
until
after
the
patients
had
finished
eating
some
of
the
patients
wanted
to
speak
about
their
having
no
salt
but
were
prevented
the
insane
asylum
on
blackwellâ€™s
island
is
a
human
rat-trap
it
is
easy
to
get
in
but
once
there
it
is
impossible
to
get
out
i
had
intended
to
have
myself
committed
to
the
violent
wards
the
lodge
and
retreat
but
when
i
got
the
testimony
of
two
sane
women
and
could
give
it
i
decided
not
to
risk
my
healthâ€”and
hairâ€”so
i
did
not
get
violent
i
had
toward
the
last
been
shut
off
from
all
visitors
and
so
when
the
lawyer
peter
a
hendricks
came
and
told
me
that
friends
of
mine
were
willing
to
take
charge
of
me
if
i
would
rather
be
with
them
than
in
the
asylum
i
was
only
too
glad
to
give
my
consent
i
asked
him
to
send
me
something
to
eat
immediately
on
his
arrival
in
the
city
and
then
i
waited
anxiously
for
my
release
it
came
sooner
than
i
had
hoped
i
was
out
â€œin
lineâ€
taking
a
walk
and
had
just
gotten
interested
in
a
poor
woman
who
had
fainted
away
while
the
nurses
were
trying
to
compel
her
to
walk
â€œgood-bye
i
am
going
homeâ€
i
called
to
pauline
moser
as
she
went
past
with
a
woman
on
either
side
of
her
sadly
i
said
farewell
to
all
i
knew
as
i
passed
them
on
my
way
to
freedom
and
life
while
they
were
left
behind
to
a
fate
worse
than
death
â€œadiosâ€
i
murmured
to
the
mexican
woman
i
kissed
my
fingers
to
her
and
so
i
left
my
companions
of
hall
7
i
had
looked
forward
so
eagerly
to
leaving
the
horrible
place
yet
when
my
release
came
and
i
knew
that
godâ€™s
sunlight
was
to
be
free
for
me
again
there
was
a
certain
pain
in
leaving
for
ten
days
i
had
been
one
of
them
foolishly
enough
it
seemed
intensely
selfish
to
leave
them
to
their
sufferings
i
felt
a
quixotic
desire
to
help
them
by
sympathy
and
presence
but
only
for
a
moment
the
bars
were
down
and
freedom
was
sweeter
to
me
than
ever
soon
i
was
crossing
the
river
and
nearing
new
york
once
again
i
was
a
free
girl
after
ten
days
in
the
mad-house
on
blackwellâ€™s
island
the
grand
jury
investigation
soon
after
i
had
bidden
farewell
to
the
blackwellâ€™s
island
insane
asylum
i
was
summoned
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
i
answered
the
summons
with
pleasure
because
i
longed
to
help
those
of
godâ€™s
most
unfortunate
children
whom
i
had
left
prisoners
behind
me
if
i
could
not
bring
them
that
boon
of
all
boons
liberty
i
hoped
at
least
to
influence
others
to
make
life
more
bearable
for
them
i
found
the
jurors
to
be
gentlemen
and
that
i
need
not
tremble
before
their
twenty-three
august
presences
i
swore
to
the
truth
of
my
story
and
then
i
related
allâ€”from
my
start
at
the
temporary
home
until
my
release
assistant
district-attorney
vernon
m
davis
conducted
the
examination
the
jurors
then
requested
that
i
should
accompany
them
on
a
visit
to
the
island
i
was
glad
to
consent
no
one
was
expected
to
know
of
the
contemplated
trip
to
the
island
yet
we
had
not
been
there
very
long
before
one
of
the
commissioners
of
charity
and
dr
macdonald
of
wardâ€™s
island
were
with
us
one
of
the
jurors
told
me
that
in
conversation
with
a
man
about
the
asylum
he
heard
that
they
were
notified
of
our
coming
an
hour
before
we
reached
the
island
this
must
have
been
done
while
the
grand
jury
were
examining
the
insane
pavilion
at
bellevue
the
trip
to
the
island
was
vastly
different
to
my
first
this
time
we
went
on
a
clean
new
boat
while
the
one
i
had
traveled
in
they
said
was
laid
up
for
repairs
some
of
the
nurses
were
examined
by
the
jury
and
made
contradictory
statements
to
one
another
as
well
as
to
my
story
they
confessed
that
the
juryâ€™s
contemplated
visit
had
been
talked
over
between
them
and
the
doctor
dr
dent
confessed
that
he
had
no
means
by
which
to
tell
positively
if
the
bath
was
cold
and
of
the
number
of
women
put
into
the
same
water
he
knew
the
food
was
not
what
it
should
be
but
said
it
was
due
to
the
lack
of
funds
if
nurses
were
cruel
to
their
patients
had
he
any
positive
means
of
ascertaining
it
no
he
had
not
he
said
all
the
doctors
were
not
competent
which
was
also
due
to
the
lack
of
means
to
secure
good
medical
men
in
conversation
with
me
he
said
â€œi
am
glad
you
did
this
now
and
had
i
known
your
purpose
i
would
have
aided
you
we
have
no
means
of
learning
the
way
things
are
going
except
to
do
as
you
did
since
your
story
was
published
i
found
a
nurse
at
the
retreat
who
had
watches
set
for
our
approach
just
as
you
had
stated
she
was
dismissedâ€
miss
anne
neville
was
brought
down
and
i
went
into
the
hall
to
meet
her
knowing
that
the
sight
of
so
many
strange
gentlemen
would
excite
her
even
if
she
be
sane
it
was
as
i
feared
the
attendants
had
told
her
she
was
going
to
be
examined
by
a
crowd
of
men
and
she
was
shaking
with
fear
although
i
had
left
her
only
two
weeks
before
yet
she
looked
as
if
she
had
suffered
a
severe
illness
in
that
time
so
changed
was
her
appearance
i
asked
her
if
she
had
taken
any
medicine
and
she
answered
in
the
affirmative
i
then
told
her
that
all
i
wanted
her
to
do
was
tell
the
jury
all
we
had
done
since
i
was
brought
with
her
to
the
asylum
so
they
would
be
convinced
that
i
was
sane
she
only
knew
me
as
miss
nellie
brown
and
was
wholly
ignorant
of
my
story
she
was
not
sworn
but
her
story
must
have
convinced
all
hearers
of
the
truth
of
my
statements
â€œwhen
miss
brown
and
i
were
brought
here
the
nurses
were
cruel
and
the
food
was
too
bad
to
eat
we
did
not
have
enough
clothing
and
miss
brown
asked
for
more
all
the
time
i
thought
she
was
very
kind
for
when
a
doctor
promised
her
some
clothing
she
said
she
would
give
it
to
me
strange
to
say
ever
since
miss
brown
has
been
taken
away
everything
is
different
the
nurses
are
very
kind
and
we
are
given
plenty

visited
the
kitchen
it
was
very
clean

two
barrels
of
salt
stood
conspicuously
open
near
the
door
the
bread
on

was
beautifully
white

wholly
unlike
what
was
given
us
to
eat
we
found
the

in

the

were
improved

in

the
buckets
in
which
we
were

been

by

them

they
did

their

advises
all

made
that
i

i
have
one
consolation
for
my

the
strength
of
my

the

trying
to
be
a
servant
my
strange
experience
at
two
employment
agencies
none
but
the
initiated
know
what
a
great
question
the
servant
question
is
and
how
many
perplexing
sides
it
has
the
mistresses
and
servants
of
course
fill
the
leading
roles
then
in
the
lesser
but
still
important
parts
come
the
agencies
which
despite
the
many
voices
clamoring
against
them
declare
themselves
public
benefactors
even
the
â€œfunny
manâ€
manages
to
fill
a
great
deal
of
space
with
the
subject
it
is
a
serious
question
since
it
affects
all
one
holds
dear
in
lifeâ€”oneâ€™s
dinner
oneâ€™s
bed
and
oneâ€™s
linen
i
had
heard
so
many
complaints
from
long-suffering
mistresses
worked-out
servants
agencies
and
lawyers
that
i
determined
to
investigate
the
subject
to
my
own
satisfaction
there
was
only
one
way
to
do
it
that
was
to
personate
a
servant
and
apply
for
a
situation
i
knew
that
there
might
be
such
a
thing
as
â€œreferencesâ€
required
and
as
i
had
never
tested
my
abilities
in
this
line
i
did
not
know
how
to
furnish
them
still
it
would
not
do
to
allow
a
little
thing
like
a
â€œreferenceâ€
to
stop
me
in
my
work
and
i
would
not
ask
any
friend
to
commit
herself
to
further
my
efforts
many
girls
must
at
one
time
be
without
references
i
thought
and
this
encouraged
me
to
make
the
risk
on
monday
afternoon
a
letter
came
to
the
world
office
from
a
lawyer
complaining
of
an
agency
where
he
claimed
a
client
of
his
had
paid
for
a
servant
and
the
agent
then
refused
to
produce
a
girl
this
shop
i
decided
to
make
my
first
essay
dressed
to
look
the
character
i
wanted
to
represent
i
walked
up
fourth
avenue
until
i
found
no
69
the
place
i
wanted
it
was
a
low
frame
building
which
retained
all
the
impressions
of
old
age
the
room
on
the
first
floor
was
filled
with
a
conglomeration
of
articles
which
gave
it
the
appearance
of
a
second-hand
store
by
a
side
door
leaning
against
the
wall
was
a
large
sign
which
told
the
passing
public
that
that
was
the
entrance
to
the
â€œgermania
servantsâ€™
agencyâ€
on
a
straight
blue
board
fastened
lengthwise
to
a
second-story
window
was
in
large
encouraging
white
letters
the
ominous
word
â€œservantsâ€
i
entered
the
side
door
and
as
there
was
nothing
before
me
but
the
dirty
uncarpeted
hall
and
a
narrow
rickety-looking
staircase
i
went
on
to
my
fate
i
passed
two
closed
doors
on
the
first
landing
and
on
the
third
i
saw
the
word
â€œofficeâ€
i
did
not
knock
but
turned
the
knob
of
the
door
and
as
it
stuck
top
and
bottom
i
pressed
my
shoulder
against
it
it
gave
way
so
did
i
and
i
entered
on
my
career
as
a
servant
with
a
tumble
it
was
a
small
room
with
a
low
ceiling
a
dusty
ingrain
carpet
and
cheaply
papered
walls
a
heavy
railing
and
a
high
desk
and
counter
which
divided
the
room
gave
it
the
appearance
of
a
police
court
around
the
walls
were
hung
colored
advertisements
of
steamship
lines
and
maps
above
the
mantel
which
was
decorated
with
two
plaster-paris
busts
was
a
square
sheet
of
white
paper
i
viewed
the
large
black
letters
on
this
paper
with
a
quaking
heart
â€œreferences
investigatedâ€
with
two
exclamation
points
now
if
it
had
only
been
put
quietly
and
mildly
or
even
with
one
exclamation
point
but
twoâ€”dreadful
it
was
a
death-warrant
to
the
idea
i
had
of
writing
my
own
references
if
any
were
demanded
illustration
in
the
intelligence
office
a
young
woman
who
was
standing
with
a
downcast
head
by
the
window
turned
to
look
at
the
abrupt
newcomer
a
man
who
had
apparently
been
conversing
with
her
came
hastily
forward
to
the
desk
he
was
a
middle-sized
man
with
a
sharp
gray
eye
a
bald
head
and
a
black
frock-coat
buttoned
up
tightly
showing
to
disadvantage
his
rounded
shoulders
â€œwellâ€
he
said
to
me
in
a
questioning
manner
as
he
glanced
quickly
over
my
â€œget
upâ€
â€œare
you
the
man
who
gets
places
for
girlsâ€
i
asked
as
if
there
were
but
one
such
man
â€œyes
iâ€™m
the
man
do
you
want
a
placeâ€
he
asked
with
a
decidedly
german
twang
â€œyes
i
want
a
placeâ€
i
replied
â€œwhat
did
you
work
at
lastâ€
â€œoh
i
was
a
chambermaid
can
you
get
me
a
position
do
you
thinkâ€
â€œyes
i
can
do
thatâ€
he
replied
â€œyouâ€™re
a
nice-looking
girl
and
i
can
soon
get
you
a
place
just
the
other
day
i
got
a
girl
a
place
for
20
a
month
just
because
she
was
nice-looking
many
gentlemen
and
ladies
also
will
pay
more
when
girls
are
nice-looking
where
did
you
work
lastâ€
â€œi
worked
in
atlantic
cityâ€
i
replied
with
a
mental
cry
for
forgiveness
â€œhave
you
no
city
referenceâ€
â€œno
none
whatever
but
i
want
a
job
in
this
city
thatâ€™s
why
i
came
hereâ€
â€œwell
i
can
get
you
a
position
never
fear
only
some
people
are
mighty
particular
about
referencesâ€
â€œhave
you
no
place
you
can
send
me
to
nowâ€
i
said
determined
to
get
at
my
business
as
soon
as
possible
â€œyou
have
to
pay
to
get
your
name
entered
on
the
book
firstâ€
he
said
opening
a
large
ledger
as
he
asked
â€œwhat
is
your
nameâ€
â€œhow
much
do
you
chargeâ€
i
asked
in
order
to
give
me
time
to
decide
on
a
name
â€œi
charge
you
one
dollar
for
the
use
of
the
bureau
for
a
month
and
if
i
get
you
a
big
salary
you
will
have
to
pay
moreâ€
â€œhow
much
moreâ€
â€œthat
depends
entirely
on
your
salaryâ€
he
answered
non-committal
â€œyour
nameâ€
â€œnow
if
i
give
you
a
dollar
you
will
assure
me
a
situationâ€
â€œcertainly
thatâ€™s
what
iâ€™m
here
forâ€
â€œand
you
guarantee
me
work
in
this
cityâ€
i
urged
â€œoh
certainly
certainly
thatâ€™s
what
this
agency
is
for
iâ€™ll
get
you
a
place
sure
enoughâ€
â€œall
right
iâ€™ll
give
you
a
dollar
which
is
a
great
deal
for
a
girl
out
of
work
my
name
is
sally
leesâ€
â€œwhat
shall
i
put
you
down
forâ€
he
asked
illustration
out
of
work
â€œoh
anythingâ€
i
replied
with
a
generosity
that
surprised
myself
â€œthen
i
shall
put
it
chambermaid
waitress
nurse
or
seamstressâ€
so
my
name
or
the
one
assumed
was
entered
in
the
ledger
and
as
i
paid
my
dollar
i
ventured
the
information
that
if
he
gave
me
a
situation
directly
i
should
be
pleased
to
give
him
more
money
he
warmed
up
at
this
and
told
me
he
should
advertise
me
in
the
morning
â€œthen
you
have
no
one
in
want
of
help
nowâ€
â€œwe
have
plenty
of
people
but
not
just
now
they
all
come
in
the
morning
this
is
too
late
in
the
day
where
are
you
boardingâ€
at
this
moment
a
woman
clad
in
a
blue
dress
with
a
small
black
shawl
wrapped
around
her
entered
from
a
room
in
the
rear
she
also
looked
me
over
sharply
as
if
i
was
an
article
for
sale
as
the
man
told
her
in
german
all
that
he
knew
about
me
â€œyou
can
stay
hereâ€
she
said
in
broken
badly
broken
english
after
she
had
learned
that
i
was
friendless
in
the
city
â€œwhere
is
your
baggageâ€
â€œi
left
my
baggage
where
i
paid
for
my
lodging
to-nightâ€
i
answered
they
tried
to
induce
me
to
stop
at
their
house
only
250
a
week
with
board
or
20
cents
a
night
for
a
bed
they
urged
that
it
was
immaterial
to
them
only
i
had
a
better
chance
to
secure
work
if
i
was
always
there
it
was
only
for
my
own
good
they
suggested
it
i
had
one
glance
of
the
adjoining
bedroom
and
that
sight
made
me
firm
in
my
determination
to
sleep
elsewhere
as
the
evening
drew
on
i
felt
they
would
have
no
more
applications
for
servants
that
afternoon
and
after
asking
the
hour
that
i
should
return
in
the
morning
i
requested
a
receipt
for
my
money
â€œyou
donâ€™t
need
to
be
so
particularâ€
he
said
crossly
but
i
told
him
i
was
and
insisted
until
he
was
forced
to
comply
it
was
not
much
of
a
receipt
he
wrote
on
the
blank
side
of
the
agencyâ€™s
advertising
card
â€œsally
lees
has
paid
1
good
for
one
month
use
of
bureau
69
4th
aveâ€
on
the
following
morning
about
1030
i
made
my
appearance
at
the
agency
some
eight
or
ten
girls
were
in
the
room
and
the
man
who
had
pocketed
my
fee
on
the
previous
afternoon
still
adorned
the
throne
back
of
the
desk
no
one
said
good-morning
or
anything
else
for
that
matter
so
i
quietly
slid
onto
a
chair
near
the
door
the
girls
were
all
comfortably
dressed
and
looked
as
if
they
had
enjoyed
hearty
breakfasts
all
sat
silent
with
a
dreamy
expression
on
their
faces
except
two
who
stood
by
the
window
watching
the
passing
throng
and
conversing
in
whispers
with
one
another
i
wanted
to
be
with
or
near
them
so
that
i
might
hear
what
was
said
after
waiting
for
some
time
i
decided
to
awake
the
man
to
the
fact
that
i
wanted
work
not
a
rest
â€œhave
you
no
place
to
send
me
this
morningâ€
â€œno
but
i
advertised
you
in
the
paperâ€
and
he
handed
me
the
tribune
of
october
25
and
pointed
out
the
following
notice
â€œnurse
câ€”by
excellent
very
neat
english
girl
as
nurse
and
seamstress
chambermaid
and
waitress
or
parlor
maid
call
at
69
4th
ave
no
cards
answeredâ€
i
choked
down
a
laugh
as
i
read
myself
advertised
in
this
manner
and
wondered
what
my
role
would
be
the
next
time
i
began
to
hope
some
one
would
soon
call
for
the
excellent
girl
but
when
an
aged
gentleman
entered
i
wished
just
as
fervently
that
he
was
not
after
me
i
was
enjoying
my
position
too
much
and
i
fear
i
could
not
restrain
my
gravity
if
any
one
began
to
question
me
poor
old
gentleman
he
looked
around
helplessly
as
if
he
was
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
the
agent
did
not
leave
him
long
in
doubt
â€œyou
want
a
girl
sirâ€
â€œyes
my
wife
read
an
advertisement
in
the
tribune
this
morning
and
she
sent
me
here
to
see
the
girlâ€
â€œyes
yes
excellent
girl
sir
come
right
back
hereâ€
opening
the
gates
and
giving
the
gentleman
a
chair
behind
the
high
counter
â€œyou
come
here
sally
leesâ€
indicating
a
chair
beside
the
visitor
for
me
i
sat
down
with
an
inward
chuckle
and
the
agent
leaned
over
the
back
of
a
chair
the
visitor
eyed
me
nervously
and
after
clearing
his
throat
several
times
and
making
vain
attempts
at
a
beginning
he
said
â€œyou
are
the
girl
who
wants
workâ€
and
after
i
answered
in
the
affirmative
he
said
â€œof
course
you
know
how
to
do
all
these
thingsâ€”you
know
what
is
required
of
a
girlâ€
â€œoh
yes
i
knowâ€
i
answered
confidently
â€œyesâ€”well
how
much
do
you
want
a
monthâ€
â€œoh
anythingâ€
i
answered
looking
to
the
agent
for
aid
he
understood
the
look
for
he
began
hurriedly
â€œfourteen
dollars
a
month
sir
she
is
an
excellent
girl
good
neat
quick
and
of
an
amiable
dispositionâ€
i
was
astonished
at
his
knowledge
of
my
good
qualities
but
i
maintained
a
lofty
silence
â€œyes
yesâ€
the
visitor
said
musingly
â€œmy
wife
only
pays
ten
dollars
a
month
and
then
if
the
girl
is
all
right
she
is
willing
to
pay
more
you
know
i
really
couldnâ€™t
you
knowâ€”â€”â€
â€œwe
have
no
ten-dollar-girls
here
sirâ€
said
the
agent
with
dignity
â€œyou
canâ€™t
get
an
honest
neat
and
respectable
girl
for
that
amountâ€
â€œhâ€™m
yes
well
this
girl
has
good
references
i
supposeâ€
â€œoh
yes
i
know
all
about
herâ€
said
the
agent
briskly
and
confidently
â€œshe
is
an
excellent
girl
and
i
can
give
you
the
best
personal
referenceâ€”the
best
of
referencesâ€
here
i
was
unknown
to
the
agent
so
far
as
he
knew
i
might
be
a
confidence
woman
a
thief
or
everything
wicked
and
yet
the
agent
was
vowing
that
he
had
good
personal
references
â€œwell
i
live
in
bloomfield
n
j
and
there
are
only
four
in
the
family
of
course
you
are
a
good
washer
and
ironerâ€
he
said
turning
to
me
before
i
had
time
to
assure
him
of
my
wonderful
skill
in
that
line
the
agent
interposed
â€œthis
is
not
the
girl
you
want
no
sir
this
girl
wonâ€™t
do
general
housework
this
is
the
girl
you
are
afterâ€
bringing
up
another
â€œshe
does
general
houseworkâ€
and
he
went
on
with
a
long
list
of
her
virtues
which
were
similar
to
those
he
had
professed
to
find
in
me
the
visitor
got
very
nervous
and
began
to
insist
that
he
could
not
take
a
girl
unless
his
wife
saw
her
first
then
the
agent
when
he
found
it
impossible
to
make
him
take
a
girl
tried
to
induce
the
gentleman
to
join
the
bureau
â€œit
will
only
cost
you
2
for
the
use
of
the
bureau
for
a
monthâ€
he
urged
but
the
visitor
began
to
get
more
nervous
and
to
make
his
way
to
the
door
i
thought
he
was
frightened
because
it
was
an
agency
and
it
amused
me
to
hear
how
earnestly
he
pleaded
that
really
he
dare
not
employ
a
girl
without
his
wifeâ€™s
consent
after
the
escape
of
the
visitor
we
all
resumed
our
former
positions
and
waited
for
another
visitor
it
came
in
the
shape
of
a
red-haired
irish
girl
â€œwell
you
are
back
againâ€
was
the
greeting
given
her
â€œyes
that
woman
was
horrible
she
and
her
husband
fought
all
the
time
and
the
cook
carried
tales
to
the
mistress
sure
and
i
wouldnâ€™t
live
at
such
a
place
a
splendid
laundress
with
a
good
â€˜karacterâ€™
donâ€™t
need
to
stay
in
such
places
i
told
them
the
lady
of
the
house
made
me
wash
every
other
day
then
she
wanted
me
to
be
dressed
like
a
lady
sure
and
wear
a
cap
while
i
was
at
work
sure
and
itâ€™s
no
good
laundress
who
can
be
dressed
up
while
at
work
so
i
left
herâ€
the
storm
had
scarcely
passed
when
another
girl
with
fiery
locks
entered
she
had
a
good
face
and
a
bright
one
and
i
watched
her
closely
â€œso
you
are
back
too
you
are
troublesomeâ€
said
the
agent
her
eyes
flashed
as
she
replied
â€œoh
iâ€™m
troublesome
am
i
well
you
can
take
a
poor
girlâ€™s
money
anyway
and
then
you
tell
her
sheâ€™s
troublesome
it
wasnâ€™t
troublesome
when
you
took
my
money
and
where
is
the
position
i
have
walked
all
over
the
city
wearing
out
my
shoes
and
spending
my
money
in
car-fare
now
is
this
how
you
treat
poor
girlsâ€
â€œi
did
not
mean
anything
by
saying
you
were
troublesome
that
was
only
my
funâ€
the
agent
tried
to
explain
and
after
awhile
the
girl
quieted
down
another
girl
came
and
was
told
that
as
she
had
not
made
her
appearance
the
day
previous
she
could
not
expect
to
obtain
a
situation
he
refused
to
send
her
word
if
there
was
any
chance
then
a
messenger
boy
called
and
said
that
mrs
vanderpool
of
no
36
west
thirty-ninth
street
wanted
the
girl
advertised
in
the
morning
paper
irish
girl
no
1
was
sent
and
she
returned
after
several
hoursâ€™
absence
to
say
that
mrs
vanderpool
said
when
she
learned
where
the
girl
came
from
that
she
knew
all
about
agencies
and
their
schemes
and
she
did
not
propose
to
have
a
girl
from
them
the
girl
buttoned
mrs
vanderpoolâ€™s
shoes
and
returned
to
the
agency
to
take
her
post
of
waiting
i
succeeded
at
last
in
drawing
one
of
the
girls
winifred
friel
into
conversation
she
said
she
had
been
waiting
for
several
days
and
that
she
had
no
chance
of
a
place
yet
the
agency
had
a
place
out
of
town
to
which
they
tried
to
force
girls
who
declared
they
would
not
leave
the
city
quite
strange
they
never
offered
the
place
to
girls
who
said
they
would
work
anywhere
winifred
friel
wanted
it
but
they
would
not
allow
her
to
go
yet
they
tried
to
insist
on
me
accepting
it
â€œwell
now
if
you
wonâ€™t
take
that
i
would
like
to
see
you
get
a
place
this
winterâ€
he
said
angrily
when
he
found
that
i
would
not
go
out
of
the
city
â€œwhy
you
promised
that
you
would
find
me
a
situation
in
the
cityâ€
â€œthatâ€™s
no
difference
if
you
wonâ€™t
take
what
i
offer
you
can
do
withoutâ€
he
said
indifferently
â€œthen
give
me
my
moneyâ€
i
said
â€œno
you
canâ€™t
have
your
money
that
goes
into
the
bureauâ€
i
urged
and
insisted
to
no
avail
and
so
i
left
the
agency
to
return
no
more
my
second
day
i
decided
to
apply
to
another
agency
so
i
went
to
mrs
l
seelyâ€™s
no
68
twenty-second
street
i
paid
my
dollar
fee
and
was
taken
to
the
third
story
and
put
in
a
small
room
which
was
packed
as
close
with
women
as
sardines
in
a
box
after
edging
my
way
in
i
was
unable
to
move
so
packed
were
we
a
woman
came
up
and
calling
me
â€œthat
tall
girlâ€
told
me
roughly
as
i
was
new
it
was
useless
for
me
to
wait
there
some
of
the
girls
said
mrs
seely
was
always
cross
to
them
and
that
i
should
not
mind
it
how
horribly
stifling
those
rooms
were
there
were
fifty-two
in
the
room
with
me
and
the
two
other
rooms
i
could
look
into
were
equally
crowded
while
groups
stood
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
hallway
it
was
a
novel
insight
i
got
of
life
some
girls
laughed
some
were
sad
some
slept
some
ate
and
others
read
while
all
sat
from
morning
till
night
waiting
a
chance
to
earn
a
living
they
are
long
waits
too
one
girl
had
been
there
two
months
others
for
days
and
weeks
it
was
good
to
see
the
glad
look
when
called
out
to
see
a
lady
and
sad
to
see
them
return
saying
that
they
did
not
suit
because
they
wore
bangs
or
their
hair
in
the
wrong
style
or
that
they
looked
bilious
or
that
they
were
too
tall
too
short
too
heavy
or
too
slender
one
poor
woman
could
not
obtain
a
place
because
she
wore
mourning
and
so
the
objections
ran
i
got
no
chance
the
entire
day
and
i
decided
that
i
could
not
endure
a
second
day
in
that
human
pack
for
two
situations
so
framing
some
sort
of
excuse
i
left
the
place
and
gave
up
trying
to
be
a
servant
nellie
bly
as
a
white
slave
her
experience
in
the
role
of
a
new
york
shop-girl
making
paper
boxes
very
early
the
other
morning
i
started
out
not
with
the
pleasure-seekers
but
with
those
who
toil
the
day
long
that
they
may
live
everybody
was
rushingâ€”girls
of
all
ages
and
appearances
and
hurrying
menâ€”and
i
went
along
as
one
of
the
throng
i
had
often
wondered
at
the
tales
of
poor
pay
and
cruel
treatment
that
working
girls
tell
there
was
one
way
of
getting
at
the
truth
and
i
determined
to
try
it
it
was
becoming
myself
a
paper
box
factory
girl
accordingly
i
started
out
in
search
of
work
without
experience
reference
or
aught
to
aid
me
it
was
a
tiresome
search
to
say
the
least
had
my
living
depended
on
it
it
would
have
been
discouraging
almost
maddening
i
went
to
a
great
number
of
factories
in
and
around
bleecker
and
grand
streets
and
sixth
avenue
where
the
workers
number
up
into
the
hundreds
â€œdo
you
know
how
to
do
the
workâ€
was
the
question
asked
by
every
one
when
i
replied
that
i
did
not
they
gave
me
no
further
attention
â€œi
am
willing
to
work
for
nothing
until
i
learnâ€
i
urged
â€œwork
for
nothing
why
if
you
paid
us
for
coming
we
wouldnâ€™t
have
you
in
our
wayâ€
said
one
â€œwe
donâ€™t
run
an
establishment
to
teach
women
tradesâ€
said
another
in
answer
to
my
plea
for
work
â€œwell
as
they
are
not
born
with
the
knowledge
how
do
they
ever
learnâ€
i
asked
illustration
the
pasting
table
â€œthe
girls
always
have
some
friend
who
wants
to
learn
if
she
wishes
to
lose
time
and
money
by
teaching
her
we
donâ€™t
object
for
we
get
the
work
the
beginner
does
for
nothingâ€
by
no
persuasion
could
i
obtain
an
entree
into
the
larger
factories
so
i
concluded
at
last
to
try
a
smaller
one
at
no
196
elm
street
quite
unlike
the
unkind
brusque
men
i
had
met
at
other
factories
the
man
here
was
very
polite
he
said
â€œif
you
have
never
done
the
work
i
donâ€™t
think
you
will
like
it
it
is
dirty
work
and
a
girl
has
to
spend
years
at
it
before
she
can
make
much
money
our
beginners
are
girls
about
sixteen
years
old
and
they
do
not
get
paid
for
two
weeks
after
they
come
hereâ€
â€œwhat
can
they
make
afterwardâ€
â€œwe
sometimes
start
them
at
week
workâ€”150
a
week
when
they
become
competent
they
go
on
pieceworkâ€”that
is
they
are
paid
by
the
hundredâ€
â€œhow
much
do
they
earn
thenâ€
â€œa
good
worker
will
earn
from
5
to
9
a
weekâ€
â€œhave
you
many
girls
hereâ€
â€œwe
have
about
sixty
in
the
building
and
a
number
who
take
the
work
home
i
have
only
been
in
this
business
for
a
few
months
but
if
you
think
you
would
like
to
try
it
i
shall
speak
to
my
partner
he
has
had
some
of
his
girls
for
eleven
years
sit
down
until
i
find
himâ€
he
left
the
office
and
i
soon
heard
him
talking
outside
about
me
and
rather
urging
that
i
be
given
a
chance
he
soon
returned
and
with
him
a
small
man
who
spoke
with
a
german
accent
he
stood
by
me
without
speaking
so
i
repeated
my
request
â€œwell
give
your
name
to
the
gentleman
at
the
desk
and
come
down
on
monday
morning
and
we
will
see
what
we
can
do
for
youâ€
and
so
it
was
that
i
started
out
early
in
the
morning
i
had
put
on
a
calico
dress
to
work
in
and
to
suit
my
chosen
trade
in
a
nice
little
bundle
covered
with
brown
paper
with
a
grease-spot
on
the
center
of
it
was
my
lunch
i
had
an
idea
that
every
working-girl
carried
a
lunch
and
i
was
trying
to
give
out
the
impression
that
i
was
quite
used
to
this
thing
indeed
i
considered
the
lunch
a
telling
stroke
of
thoughtfulness
in
my
new
role
and
eyed
with
some
pride
in
which
was
mixed
a
little
dismay
the
grease-spot
which
was
gradually
growing
in
size
early
as
it
was
i
found
all
the
girls
there
and
at
work
i
went
through
a
small
wagon-yard
the
only
entrance
to
the
office
after
making
my
excuses
to
the
gentleman
at
the
desk
he
called
to
a
pretty
little
girl
who
had
her
apron
full
of
pasteboard
and
said
â€œtake
this
lady
up
to
norahâ€
â€œis
she
to
work
on
boxes
or
cornucopiasâ€
asked
the
girl
â€œtell
norah
to
put
her
on
boxesâ€
following
my
little
guide
i
climbed
the
narrowest
darkest
and
most
perpendicular
stair
it
has
ever
been
my
misfortune
to
see
on
and
on
we
went
through
small
rooms
filled
with
working
girls
to
the
top
floorâ€”fourth
or
fifth
story
i
have
forgotten
which
any
way
i
was
breathless
when
i
got
there
â€œnorah
here
is
a
lady
you
are
to
put
on
boxesâ€
called
out
my
pretty
little
guide
all
the
girls
that
surrounded
the
long
tables
turned
from
their
work
and
looked
at
me
curiously
the
auburn-haired
girl
addressed
as
norah
raised
her
eyes
from
the
box
she
was
making
and
replied
â€œsee
if
the
hatchway
is
down
and
show
her
where
to
put
her
clothesâ€
then
the
forewoman
ordered
one
of
the
girls
to
â€œget
the
lady
a
stoolâ€
and
sat
down
before
a
long
table
on
which
was
piled
a
lot
of
pasteboard
squares
labeled
in
the
center
norah
spread
some
long
slips
of
paper
on
the
table
then
taking
up
a
scrub-brush
she
dipped
it
into
a
bucket
of
paste
and
then
rubbed
it
over
the
paper
next
she
took
one
of
the
squares
of
pasteboard
and
running
her
thumb
deftly
along
turned
up
the
edges
this
done
she
took
one
of
the
slips
of
paper
and
put
it
quickly
and
neatly
over
the
corner
binding
them
together
and
holding
them
in
place
she
quickly
cut
the
paper
off
at
the
edge
with
her
thumb-nail
and
swung
the
thing
around
and
did
the
next
corner
this
i
soon
found
made
a
box
lid
it
looked
and
was
very
easy
and
in
a
few
moments
i
was
able
to
make
one
i
did
not
find
the
work
difficult
to
learn
but
rather
disagreeable
the
room
was
not
ventilated
and
the
paste
and
glue
were
very
offensive
the
piles
of
boxes
made
conversation
impossible
with
all
the
girls
except
a
beginner
therese
who
sat
by
my
side
she
was
very
timid
at
first
but
after
i
questioned
her
kindly
she
grew
more
communicative
â€œi
live
on
eldrige
street
with
my
parents
my
father
is
a
musician
but
he
will
not
go
on
the
streets
to
play
he
very
seldom
gets
an
engagement
my
mother
is
sick
nearly
all
the
time
i
have
a
sister
who
works
at
passementerie
she
can
earn
from
3
to
5
a
week
i
have
another
sister
who
has
been
spooling
silk
in
twenty-third
street
for
five
years
now
she
makes
6
a
week
when
she
comes
home
at
night
her
face
and
hands
and
hair
are
all
colored
from
the
silk
she
works
on
during
the
day
it
makes
her
sick
and
she
is
always
taking
medicineâ€
â€œhave
you
worked
beforeâ€
â€œoh
yes
i
used
to
work
at
passementerie
on
spring
street
i
worked
from
7
until
6
oâ€™clock
piecework
and
made
about
350
a
week
i
left
because
the
bosses
were
not
kind
and
we
only
had
three
little
oil
lamps
to
see
to
work
by
the
rooms
were
very
dark
but
they
never
allowed
us
to
burn
the
gas
ladies
used
to
come
here
and
take
the
work
home
to
do
they
did
it
cheap
for
the
pleasure
of
doing
it
so
we
did
not
get
as
much
pay
as
we
would
otherwiseâ€
â€œwhat
did
you
do
after
you
left
thereâ€
i
asked
â€œi
went
to
work
in
a
fringe
factory
on
canal
street
a
woman
had
the
place
and
she
was
very
unkind
to
all
the
girls
she
did
not
speak
english
i
worked
an
entire
week
from
8
to
6
with
only
a
half-hour
for
dinner
and
at
the
end
of
the
week
she
only
paid
me
35
cents
you
know
a
girl
cannot
live
on
35
cents
a
week
so
i
leftâ€
â€œhow
do
you
like
the
box
factoryâ€
â€œwell
the
bosses
seem
very
kind
they
always
say
good-morning
to
me
a
thing
never
done
in
any
other
place
i
ever
worked
but
it
is
a
good
deal
for
a
poor
girl
to
give
two
weeksâ€™
work
for
nothing
i
have
been
here
almost
two
weeks
and
i
have
done
a
great
deal
of
work
itâ€™s
all
clear
gain
to
the
bosses
they
say
they
often
dismiss
a
girl
after
her
first
two
weeks
on
the
plea
that
she
does
not
suit
after
this
i
am
to
get
150
a
weekâ€
when
the
whistles
of
the
surrounding
factories
blew
at
12
oâ€™clock
the
forewoman
told
us
we
could
quit
work
and
eat
our
lunch
i
was
not
quite
so
proud
of
my
cleverness
in
simulating
a
working
girl
when
one
of
them
said
â€œdo
you
want
to
send
out
for
your
lunchâ€
â€œno
i
brought
it
with
meâ€
i
replied
â€œohâ€
she
exclaimed
with
a
knowing
inflection
and
amused
smile
â€œis
there
anything
wrongâ€
i
asked
answering
her
smile
illustration
finishing
up
â€œoh
noâ€
quickly
â€œonly
the
girls
always
make
fun
of
any
one
who
carries
a
basket
now
no
working-girl
will
carry
a
lunch
or
basket
it
is
out
of
style
because
it
marks
the
girl
at
once
as
a
worker
i
would
like
to
carry
a
basket
but
i
donâ€™t
dare
because
they
would
make
so
much
fun
of
meâ€
the
girls
sent
out
for
lunch
and
i
asked
of
them
the
prices
for
five
cents
they
get
a
good
pint
of
coffee
with
sugar
and
milk
if
desired
two
cents
will
buy
three
slices
of
buttered
bread
three
cents
a
sandwich
many
times
a
number
of
the
girls
will
put
all
their
money
together
and
buy
quite
a
little
feast
a
bowl
of
soup
for
five
cents
will
give
four
girls
a
taste
by
clubbing
together
they
are
able
to
buy
warm
lunch
at
one
oâ€™clock
we
were
all
at
work
again
i
having
completed
sixty-four
lids
and
the
supply
being
consumed
was
put
at
â€œmolding
inâ€
this
is
fitting
the
bottom
into
the
sides
of
the
box
and
pasting
it
there
it
is
rather
difficult
at
first
to
make
all
the
edges
come
closely
and
neatly
together
but
after
a
little
experience
it
can
be
done
easily
on
my
second
day
i
was
put
at
a
table
with
some
new
girls
and
i
tried
to
get
them
to
talk
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
they
are
very
timid
about
telling
their
names
where
they
live
or
how
i
endeavored
by
every
means
a
woman
knows
to
get
an
invitation
to
visit
their
homes
but
did
not
succeed
â€œhow
much
can
girls
earn
hereâ€
i
asked
the
forewoman
â€œi
do
not
knowâ€
she
said
â€œthey
never
tell
each
other
and
the
bosses
keep
their
timeâ€
â€œhave
you
worked
here
longâ€
i
asked
â€œyes
i
have
been
here
eight
years
and
in
that
time
i
have
taught
my
three
sistersâ€
â€œis
the
work
profitableâ€
â€œwell
it
is
steady
but
a
girl
must
have
many
yearsâ€™
experience
before
she
can
work
fast
enough
to
earn
muchâ€
the
girls
all
seem
happy
during
the
day
they
would
make
the
little
building
resound
with
their
singing
a
song
would
be
begun
on
the
second
floor
probably
and
each
floor
would
take
it
up
in
succession
until
all
were
singing
they
were
nearly
always
kind
to
one
another
their
little
quarrels
did
not
last
long
nor
were
they
very
fierce
they
were
all
extremely
kind
to
me
and
did
all
they
could
to
make
my
work
easy
and
pleasant
i
felt
quite
proud
when
able
to
make
an
entire
box
there
were
two
girls
at
one
table
on
piecework
who
had
been
in
a
great
many
box
factories
and
had
had
a
varied
experience
â€œgirls
do
not
get
paid
half
enough
at
any
work
box
factories
are
no
worse
than
other
places
i
do
not
know
anything
a
girl
can
do
where
by
hard
work
she
can
earn
more
than
6
a
week
a
girl
cannot
dress
and
pay
her
boarding
on
thatâ€
â€œwhere
do
such
girls
liveâ€
i
asked
â€œthere
are
boarding-houses
on
bleecker
and
houston
and
around
such
places
where
girls
can
get
a
room
and
meals
for
350
a
week
the
room
may
be
only
for
two
in
one
bed
or
it
may
have
a
dozen
according
to
size
they
have
no
conveniences
or
comforts
and
generally
undesirable
men
board
at
the
same
placeâ€
â€œwhy
donâ€™t
they
live
at
these
homes
that
are
run
to
accommodate
working
womenâ€
â€œoh
those
homes
are
frauds
a
girl
cannot
obtain
any
more
home
comforts
and
then
the
restrictions
are
more
than
they
will
endure
a
girl
who
works
all
day
must
have
some
recreation
and
she
never
finds
it
in
homesâ€
â€œhave
you
worked
in
box
factories
longâ€
â€œfor
eleven
years
and
i
canâ€™t
say
that
it
has
ever
given
me
a
living
on
an
average
i
make
5
a
week
i
pay
out
350
for
board
and
my
wash
bill
at
the
least
is
75
cents
can
any
one
expect
a
woman
to
dress
on
what
remainsâ€
â€œwhat
do
you
get
paid
for
boxesâ€
â€œi
get
50
cents
a
hundred
for
one-pound
candy
boxes
and
40
cents
a
hundred
for
half-pound
boxesâ€
â€œwhat
work
do
you
do
on
a
box
for
that
payâ€
â€œeverything
i
get
the
pasteboard
cut
in
squares
the
same
as
you
did
i
first
â€˜set
upâ€™
the
lids
then
i
â€˜mold
inâ€™
the
bottoms
this
forms
a
box
next
i
do
the
â€˜trimmingâ€™
which
is
putting
the
gilt
edge
around
the
box
lid
â€˜cover
stripingâ€™
covering
the
edge
of
the
lid
is
next
and
then
comes
the
â€˜top
labelâ€™
which
finishes
the
lid
entire
then
i
paper
the
box
do
the
â€˜bottom
labelingâ€™
and
then
put
in
two
or
four
laces
lace
paper
on
the
inside
as
ordered
thus
you
see
one
box
passes
through
my
hands
eight
times
before
it
is
finished
i
have
to
work
very
hard
and
without
ceasing
to
be
able
to
make
two
hundred
boxes
a
day
which
earns
me
1
it
is
not
enough
pay
you
see
i
handle
two
hundred
boxes
sixteen
hundred
times
for
1
cheap
labor
isnâ€™t
itâ€
one
very
bright
girl
maggie
who
sat
opposite
me
told
a
story
that
made
my
heart
ache
â€œthis
is
my
second
week
hereâ€
she
said
â€œand
of
course
i
wonâ€™t
receive
any
pay
until
next
week
when
i
expect
to
receive
150
for
six
daysâ€™
work
my
father
was
a
driver
before
he
got
sick
i
donâ€™t
know
what
is
wrong
but
the
doctor
says
he
will
die
before
i
left
this
morning
he
said
my
father
will
die
soon
i
could
hardly
work
because
of
it
i
am
the
oldest
child
and
i
have
a
brother
and
two
sisters
younger
i
am
sixteen
and
my
brother
is
twelve
he
gets
2
a
week
for
being
office-boy
at
a
cigar-box
factoryâ€
â€œdo
you
have
much
rent
to
payâ€
â€œwe
have
two
rooms
in
a
house
on
houston
street
they
are
small
and
have
low
ceilings
and
there
are
a
great
many
chinamen
in
the
same
house
we
pay
for
these
rooms
14
per
month
we
do
not
have
much
to
eat
but
then
father
doesnâ€™t
mind
it
because
he
canâ€™t
eat
we
could
not
live
if
fatherâ€™s
lodge
did
not
pay
our
rentâ€
â€œdid
you
ever
work
beforeâ€
â€œyes
i
once
worked
in
a
carpet
factory
at
yonkers
i
only
had
to
work
there
one
week
until
i
learned
and
afterward
i
made
at
piecework
a
dollar
a
day
when
my
father
got
so
ill
my
mother
wanted
me
at
home
but
now
when
we
see
i
can
earn
so
little
they
wish
i
had
remained
thereâ€
â€œwhy
do
you
not
try
something
elseâ€
i
asked
â€œi
wanted
to
but
could
find
nothing
father
sent
me
to
school
until
i
was
fourteen
and
so
i
thought
i
would
learn
to
be
a
telegraph
operator
i
went
to
a
place
in
twenty-third
street
where
it
is
taught
but
the
man
said
he
would
not
give
me
a
lesson
unless
i
paid
fifty
dollars
in
advance
i
could
not
do
thatâ€
i
then
spoke
of
the
cooper
institute
which
i
thought
every
new
yorker
knew
was
for
the
benefit
of
just
such
cases
i
was
greatly
astonished
to
learn
that
such
a
thing
as
the
cooper
institute
was
wholly
unknown
to
all
the
workers
around
me
â€œif
my
father
knew
that
there
was
a
free
school
he
would
send
meâ€
said
one
â€œi
would
go
in
the
eveningsâ€
said
another
â€œif
i
had
known
there
was
such
a
placeâ€
again
when
some
of
them
were
complaining
of
unjust
wages
and
some
of
places
where
they
had
been
unable
to
collect
the
amount
due
them
after
working
i
spoke
of
the
mission
of
the
knights
of
labor
and
the
newly
organized
society
for
women
they
were
all
surprised
to
hear
that
there
were
any
means
to
aid
women
in
having
justice
i
moralized
somewhat
on
the
use
of
any
such
societies
unless
they
entered
the
heart
of
these
factories
one
girl
who
worked
on
the
floor
below
me
said
they
were
not
allowed
to
tell
what
they
earned
however
she
had
been
working
here
five
years
and
she
did
not
average
more
than
5
a
week
the
factory
in
itself
was
a
totally
unfit
place
for
women
the
rooms
were
small
and
there
was
no
ventilation
in
case
of
fire
there
was
practically
no
escape
the
work
was
tiresome
and
after
i
had
learned
all
i
could
from
the
rather
reticent
girls
i
was
anxious
to
leave
i
noticed
some
rather
peculiar
things
on
my
trip
to
and
from
the
factory
i
noticed
that
men
were
much
quicker
to
offer
their
places
to
the
working-girls
on
the
cars
than
they
were
to
offer
them
to
well-dressed
women
another
thing
quite
as
noticeable
i
had
more
men
try
to
get
up
a
flirtation
with
me
while
i
was
a
box-factory
girl
than
i
ever
had
before
the
girls
were
nice
in
their
manners
and
as
polite
as
ones
reared
at
home
they
never
forgot
to
thank
one
another
for
the
slightest
service
and
there
was
quite
a
little
air
of
â€œgood
formâ€
in
many
of
their
actions
i
have
seen
many
worse
girls
in
much
higher
positions
than
the
white
slaves

york
