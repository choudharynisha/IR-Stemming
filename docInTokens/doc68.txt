i
have
always
been
much
interested
by
the
traditions
which
are
scattered
up
and
down
north
wales
relating
to
owen
glendower
owain
glendwr
is
the
national
spelling
of
the
name
and
i
fully
enter
into
the
feeling
which
makes
the
welsh
peasant
still
look
upon
him
as
the
hero
of
his
country
there
was
great
joy
among
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
principality
when
the
subject
of
the
welsh
prize
poem
at
oxford
some
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
ago
was
announced
to
be
â€œowain
glendwrâ€
it
was
the
most
proudly
national
subject
that
had
been
given
for
years
perhaps
some
may
not
be
aware
that
this
redoubted
chieftain
is
even
in
the
present
days
of
enlightenment
as
famous
among
his
illiterate
countrymen
for
his
magical
powers
as
for
his
patriotism
he
says
himselfâ€”or
shakespeare
says
it
for
him
which
is
much
the
same
thingâ€”
â€˜at
my
nativity
the
front
of
heaven
was
full
of
fiery
shapes
of
burning
cressets






i
can
call
spirits
from
the
vasty
deepâ€™
and
few
among
the
lower
orders
in
the
principality
would
think
of
asking
hotspurâ€™s
irreverent
question
in
reply
among
other
traditions
preserved
relative
to
this
part
of
the
welsh
heroâ€™s
character
is
the
old
family
prophecy
which
gives
title
to
this
tale
when
sir
david
gam
â€œas
black
a
traitor
as
if
he
had
been
born
in
builthâ€
sought
to
murder
owen
at
machynlleth
there
was
one
with
him
whose
name
glendwr
little
dreamed
of
having
associated
with
his
enemies
rhys
ap
gryfydd
his
â€œold
familiar
friendâ€
his
relation
his
more
than
brother
had
consented
unto
his
blood
sir
david
gam
might
be
forgiven
but
one
whom
he
had
loved
and
who
had
betrayed
him
could
never
be
forgiven
glendwr
was
too
deeply
read
in
the
human
heart
to
kill
him
no
he
let
him
live
on
the
loathing
and
scorn
of
his
compatriots
and
the
victim
of
bitter
remorse
the
mark
of
cain
was
upon
him
but
before
he
went
forthâ€”while
he
yet
stood
a
prisoner
cowering
beneath
his
conscience
before
owain
glendwrâ€”that
chieftain
passed
a
doom
upon
him
and
his
race
â€œi
doom
thee
to
live
because
i
know
thou
wilt
pray
for
death
thou
shalt
live
on
beyond
the
natural
term
of
the
life
of
man
the
scorn
of
all
good
men
the
very
children
shall
point
to
thee
with
hissing
tongue
and
say
â€˜there
goes
one
who
would
have
shed
a
brotherâ€™s
bloodâ€™
for
i
loved
thee
more
than
a
brother
oh
rhys
ap
gryfydd
thou
shalt
live
on
to
see
all
of
thy
house
except
the
weakling
in
arms
perish
by
the
sword
thy
race
shall
be
accursed
each
generation
shall
see
their
lands
melt
away
like
snow
yea
their
wealth
shall
vanish
though
they
may
labour
night
and
day
to
heap
up
gold
and
when
nine
generations
have
passed
from
the
face
of
the
earth
thy
blood
shall
no
longer
flow
in
the
veins
of
any
human
being
in
those
days
the
last
male
of
thy
race
shall
avenge
me
the
son
shall
slay
the
fatherâ€
such
was
the
traditionary
account
of
owain
glendwrâ€™s
speech
to
his
once-trusted
friend
and
it
was
declared
that
the
doom
had
been
fulfilled
in
all
things
that
live
in
as
miserly
a
manner
as
they
would
the
griffiths
never
were
wealthy
and
prosperousâ€”indeed
that
their
worldly
stock
diminished
without
any
visible
cause
but
the
lapse
of
many
years
had
almost
deadened
the
wonder-inspiring
power
of
the
whole
curse
it
was
only
brought
forth
from
the
hoards
of
memory
when
some
untoward
event
happened
to
the
griffiths
family
and
in
the
eighth
generation
the
faith
in
the
prophecy
was
nearly
destroyed
by
the
marriage
of
the
griffiths
of
that
day
to
a
miss
owen
who
unexpectedly
by
the
death
of
a
brother
became
an
heiressâ€”to
no
considerable
amount
to
be
sure
but
enough
to
make
the
prophecy
appear
reversed
the
heiress
and
her
husband
removed
from
his
small
patrimonial
estate
in
merionethshire
to
her
heritage
in
caernarvonshire
and
for
a
time
the
prophecy
lay
dormant
if
you
go
from
tremadoc
to
criccaeth
you
pass
by
the
parochial
church
of
ynysynhanarn
situated
in
a
boggy
valley
running
from
the
mountains
which
shoulder
up
to
the
rivals
down
to
cardigan
bay
this
tract
of
land
has
every
appearance
of
having
been
redeemed
at
no
distant
period
of
time
from
the
sea
and
has
all
the
desolate
rankness
often
attendant
upon
such
marshes
but
the
valley
beyond
similar
in
character
had
yet
more
of
gloom
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
in
the
higher
part
there
were
large
plantations
of
firs
set
too
closely
to
attain
any
size
and
remaining
stunted
in
height
and
scrubby
in
appearance
indeed
many
of
the
smaller
and
more
weakly
had
died
and
the
bark
had
fallen
down
on
the
brown
soil
neglected
and
unnoticed
these
trees
had
a
ghastly
appearance
with
their
white
trunks
seen
by
the
dim
light
which
struggled
through
the
thick
boughs
above
nearer
to
the
sea
the
valley
assumed
a
more
open
though
hardly
a
more
cheerful
character
it
looked
dark
and
overhung
by
sea-fog
through
the
greater
part
of
the
year
and
even
a
farm-house
which
usually
imparts
something
of
cheerfulness
to
a
landscape
failed
to
do
so
here
this
valley
formed
the
greater
part
of
the
estate
to
which
owen
griffiths
became
entitled
by
right
of
his
wife
in
the
higher
part
of
the
valley
was
situated
the
family
mansion
or
rather
dwelling-house
for
â€œmansionâ€
is
too
grand
a
word
to
apply
to
the
clumsy
but
substantially-built
bodowen
it
was
square
and
heavy-looking
with
just
that
much
pretension
to
ornament
necessary
to
distinguish
it
from
the
mere
farm-house
in
this
dwelling
mrs
owen
griffiths
bore
her
husband
two
sonsâ€”llewellyn
the
future
squire
and
robert
who
was
early
destined
for
the
church
the
only
difference
in
their
situation
up
to
the
time
when
robert
was
entered
at
jesus
college
was
that
the
elder
was
invariably
indulged
by
all
around
him
while
robert
was
thwarted
and
indulged
by
turns
that
llewellyn
never
learned
anything
from
the
poor
welsh
parson
who
was
nominally
his
private
tutor
while
occasionally
squire
griffiths
made
a
great
point
of
enforcing
robertâ€™s
diligence
telling
him
that
as
he
had
his
bread
to
earn
he
must
pay
attention
to
his
learning
there
is
no
knowing
how
far
the
very
irregular
education
he
had
received
would
have
carried
robert
through
his
college
examinations
but
luckily
for
him
in
this
respect
before
such
a
trial
of
his
learning
came
round
he
heard
of
the
death
of
his
elder
brother
after
a
short
illness
brought
on
by
a
hard
drinking-bout
of
course
robert
was
summoned
home
and
it
seemed
quite
as
much
of
course
now
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
him
to
â€œearn
his
bread
by
his
learningâ€
that
he
should
not
return
to
oxford
so
the
half-educated
but
not
unintelligent
young
man
continued
at
home
during
the
short
remainder
of
his
parentâ€™s
lifetime
his
was
not
an
uncommon
character
in
general
he
was
mild
indolent
and
easily
managed
but
once
thoroughly
roused
his
passions
were
vehement
and
fearful
he
seemed
indeed
almost
afraid
of
himself
and
in
common
hardly
dared
to
give
way
to
justifiable
angerâ€”so
much
did
he
dread
losing
his
self-control
had
he
been
judiciously
educated
he
would
probably
have
distinguished
himself
in
those
branches
of
literature
which
call
for
taste
and
imagination
rather
than
any
exertion
of
reflection
or
judgment
as
it
was
his
literary
taste
showed
itself
in
making
collections
of
cambrian
antiquities
of
every
description
till
his
stock
of
welsh
mss
would
have
excited
the
envy
of
dr
pugh
himself
had
he
been
alive
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
there
is
one
characteristic
of
robert
griffiths
which
i
have
omitted
to
note
and
which
was
peculiar
among
his
class
he
was
no
hard
drinker
whether
it
was
that
his
head
was
easily
affected
or
that
his
partially-refined
taste
led
him
to
dislike
intoxication
and
its
attendant
circumstances
i
cannot
say
but
at
five-and-twenty
robert
griffiths
was
habitually
soberâ€”a
thing
so
rare
in
llyn
that
he
was
almost
shunned
as
a
churlish
unsociable
being
and
paused
much
of
his
time
in
solitude
about
this
time
he
had
to
appear
in
some
case
that
was
tried
at
the
caernarvon
assizes
and
while
there
was
a
guest
at
the
house
of
his
agent
a
shrewd
sensible
welsh
attorney
with
one
daughter
who
had
charms
enough
to
captivate
robert
griffiths
though
he
remained
only
a
few
days
at
her
fatherâ€™s
house
they
were
sufficient
to
decide
his
affections
and
short
was
the
period
allowed
to
elapse
before
he
brought
home
a
mistress
to
bodowen
the
new
mrs
griffiths
was
a
gentle
yielding
person
full
of
love
toward
her
husband
of
whom
nevertheless
she
stood
something
in
awe
partly
arising
from
the
difference
in
their
ages
partly
from
his
devoting
much
time
to
studies
of
which
she
could
understand
nothing
she
soon
made
him
the
father
of
a
blooming
little
daughter
called
augharad
after
her
mother
then
there
came
several
uneventful
years
in
the
household
of
bodowen
and
when
the
old
women
had
one
and
all
declared
that
the
cradle
would
not
rock
again
mrs
griffiths
bore
the
son
and
heir
his
birth
was
soon
followed
by
his
motherâ€™s
death
she
had
been
ailing
and
low-spirited
during
her
pregnancy
and
she
seemed
to
lack
the
buoyancy
of
body
and
mind
requisite
to
bring
her
round
after
her
time
of
trial
her
husband
who
loved
her
all
the
more
from
having
few
other
claims
on
his
affections
was
deeply
grieved
by
her
early
death
and
his
only
comforter
was
the
sweet
little
boy
whom
she
had
left
behind
that
part
of
the
squireâ€™s
character
which
was
so
tender
and
almost
feminine
seemed
called
forth
by
the
helpless
situation
of
the
little
infant
who
stretched
out
his
arms
to
his
father
with
the
same
earnest
cooing
that
happier
children
make
use
of
to
their
mother
alone
augharad
was
almost
neglected
while
the
little
owen
was
king
of
the
house
still
next
to
his
father
none
tended
him
so
lovingly
as
his
sister
she
was
so
accustomed
to
give
way
to
him
that
it
was
no
longer
a
hardship
by
night
and
by
day
owen
was
the
constant
companion
of
his
father
and
increasing
years
seemed
only
to
confirm
the
custom
it
was
an
unnatural
life
for
the
child
seeing
no
bright
little
faces
peering
into
his
own
for
augharad
was
as
i
said
before
five
or
six
years
older
and
her
face
poor
motherless
girl
was
often
anything
but
bright
hearing
no
din
of
clear
ringing
voices
but
day
after
day
sharing
the
otherwise
solitary
hours
of
his
father
whether
in
the
dim
room
surrounded
by
wizard-like
antiquities
or
pattering
his
little
feet
to
keep
up
with
his
â€œtadaâ€
in
his
mountain
rambles
or
shooting
excursions
when
the
pair
came
to
some
little
foaming
brook
where
the
stepping-stones
were
far
and
wide
the
father
carried
his
little
boy
across
with
the
tenderest
care
when
the
lad
was
weary
they
rested
he
cradled
in
his
fatherâ€™s
arms
or
the
squire
would
lift
him
up
and
carry
him
to
his
home
again
the
boy
was
indulged
for
his
father
felt
flattered
by
the
desire
in
his
wish
of
sharing
his
meals
and
keeping
the
same
hours
all
this
indulgence
did
not
render
owen
unamiable
but
it
made
him
wilful
and
not
a
happy
child
he
had
a
thoughtful
look
not
common
to
the
face
of
a
young
boy
he
knew
no
games
no
merry
sports
his
information
was
of
an
imaginative
and
speculative
character
his
father
delighted
to
interest
him
in
his
own
studies
without
considering
how
far
they
were
healthy
for
so
young
a
mind
of
course
squire
griffiths
was
not
unaware
of
the
prophecy
which
was
to
be
fulfilled
in
his
generation
he
would
occasionally
refer
to
it
when
among
his
friends
with
sceptical
levity
but
in
truth
it
lay
nearer
to
his
heart
than
he
chose
to
acknowledge
his
strong
imagination
rendered
him
peculiarly
impressible
on
such
subjects
while
his
judgment
seldom
exercised
or
fortified
by
severe
thought
could
not
prevent
his
continually
recurring
to
it
he
used
to
gaze
on
the
half-sad
countenance
of
the
child
who
sat
looking
up
into
his
face
with
his
large
dark
eyes
so
fondly
yet
so
inquiringly
till
the
old
legend
swelled
around
his
heart
and
became
too
painful
for
him
not
to
require
sympathy
besides
the
overpowering
love
he
bore
to
the
child
seemed
to
demand
fuller
vent
than
tender
words
it
made
him
like
yet
dread
to
upbraid
its
object
for
the
fearful
contrast
foretold
still
squire
griffiths
told
the
legend
in
a
half-jesting
manner
to
his
little
son
when
they
were
roaming
over
the
wild
heaths
in
the
autumn
days
â€œthe
saddest
of
the
yearâ€
or
while
they
sat
in
the
oak-wainscoted
room
surrounded
by
mysterious
relics
that
gleamed
strangely
forth
by
the
flickering
fire-light
the
legend
was
wrought
into
the
boyâ€™s
mind
and
he
would
crave
yet
tremble
to
hear
it
told
over
and
over
again
while
the
words
were
intermingled
with
caresses
and
questions
as
to
his
love
occasionally
his
loving
words
and
actions
were
cut
short
by
his
fatherâ€™s
light
yet
bitter
speechâ€”â€œget
thee
away
my
lad
thou
knowest
not
what
is
to
come
of
all
this
loveâ€
when
augharad
was
seventeen
and
owen
eleven
or
twelve
the
rector
of
the
parish
in
which
bodowen
was
situated
endeavoured
to
prevail
on
squire
griffiths
to
send
the
boy
to
school
now
this
rector
had
many
congenial
tastes
with
his
parishioner
and
was
his
only
intimate
and
by
repeated
arguments
he
succeeded
in
convincing
the
squire
that
the
unnatural
life
owen
was
leading
was
in
every
way
injurious
unwillingly
was
the
father
wrought
to
part
from
his
son
but
he
did
at
length
send
him
to
the
grammar
school
at
bangor
then
under
the
management
of
an
excellent
classic
here
owen
showed
that
he
had
more
talents
than
the
rector
had
given
him
credit
for
when
he
affirmed
that
the
lad
had
been
completely
stupefied
by
the
life
he
led
at
bodowen
he
bade
fair
to
do
credit
to
the
school
in
the
peculiar
branch
of
learning
for
which
it
was
famous
but
he
was
not
popular
among
his
schoolfellows
he
was
wayward
though
to
a
certain
degree
generous
and
unselfish
he
was
reserved
but
gentle
except
when
the
tremendous
bursts
of
passion
similar
in
character
to
those
of
his
father
forced
their
way
on
his
return
from
school
one
christmas-time
when
he
had
been
a
year
or
so
at
bangor
he
was
stunned
by
hearing
that
the
undervalued
augharad
was
about
to
be
married
to
a
gentleman
of
south
wales
residing
near
aberystwith
boys
seldom
appreciate
their
sisters
but
owen
thought
of
the
many
slights
with
which
he
had
requited
the
patient
augharad
and
he
gave
way
to
bitter
regrets
which
with
a
selfish
want
of
control
over
his
words
he
kept
expressing
to
his
father
until
the
squire
was
thoroughly
hurt
and
chagrined
at
the
repeated
exclamations
of
â€œwhat
shall
we
do
when
augharad
is
goneâ€
â€œhow
dull
we
shall
be
when
augharad
is
marriedâ€
owenâ€™s
holidays
were
prolonged
a
few
weeks
in
order
that
he
might
be
present
at
the
wedding
and
when
all
the
festivities
were
over
and
the
bride
and
bridegroom
had
left
bodowen
the
boy
and
his
father
really
felt
how
much
they
missed
the
quiet
loving
augharad
she
had
performed
so
many
thoughtful
noiseless
little
offices
on
which
their
daily
comfort
depended
and
now
she
was
gone
the
household
seemed
to
miss
the
spirit
that
peacefully
kept
it
in
order
the
servants
roamed
about
in
search
of
commands
and
directions
the
rooms
had
no
longer
the
unobtrusive
ordering
of
taste
to
make
them
cheerful
the
very
fires
burned
dim
and
were
always
sinking
down
into
dull
heaps
of
gray
ashes
altogether
owen
did
not
regret
his
return
to
bangor
and
this
also
the
mortified
parent
perceived
squire
griffiths
was
a
selfish
parent
letters
in
those
days
were
a
rare
occurrence
owen
usually
received
one
during
his
half-yearly
absences
from
home
and
occasionally
his
father
paid
him
a
visit
this
half-year
the
boy
had
no
visit
nor
even
a
letter
till
very
near
the
time
of
his
leaving
school
and
then
he
was
astounded
by
the
intelligence
that
his
father
was
married
again
then
came
one
of
his
paroxysms
of
rage
the
more
disastrous
in
its
effects
upon
his
character
because
it
could
find
no
vent
in
action
independently
of
slight
to
the
memory
of
the
first
wife
which
children
are
so
apt
to
fancy
such
an
action
implies
owen
had
hitherto
considered
himself
and
with
justice
the
first
object
of
his
fatherâ€™s
life
they
had
been
so
much
to
each
other
and
now
a
shapeless
but
too
real
something
had
come
between
him
and
his
father
there
for
ever
he
felt
as
if
his
permission
should
have
been
asked
as
if
he
should
have
been
consulted
certainly
he
ought
to
have
been
told
of
the
intended
event
so
the
squire
felt
and
hence
his
constrained
letter
which
had
so
much
increased
the
bitterness
of
owenâ€™s
feelings
with
all
this
anger
when
owen
saw
his
stepmother
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
so
beautiful
a
woman
for
her
age
for
she
was
no
longer
in
the
bloom
of
youth
being
a
widow
when
his
father
married
her
her
manners
to
the
welsh
lad
who
had
seen
little
of
female
grace
among
the
families
of
the
few
antiquarians
with
whom
his
father
visited
were
so
fascinating
that
he
watched
her
with
a
sort
of
breathless
admiration
her
measured
grace
her
faultless
movements
her
tones
of
voice
sweet
till
the
ear
was
sated
with
their
sweetness
made
owen
less
angry
at
his
fatherâ€™s
marriage
yet
he
felt
more
than
ever
that
the
cloud
was
between
him
and
his
father
that
the
hasty
letter
he
had
sent
in
answer
to
the
announcement
of
his
wedding
was
not
forgotten
although
no
allusion
was
ever
made
to
it
he
was
no
longer
his
fatherâ€™s
confidantâ€”hardly
ever
his
fatherâ€™s
companion
for
the
newly-married
wife
was
all
in
all
to
the
squire
and
his
son
felt
himself
almost
a
cipher
where
he
had
so
long
been
everything
the
lady
herself
had
ever
the
softest
consideration
for
her
stepson
almost
too
obtrusive
was
the
attention
paid
to
his
wishes
but
still
he
fancied
that
the
heart
had
no
part
in
the
winning
advances
there
was
a
watchful
glance
of
the
eye
that
owen
once
or
twice
caught
when
she
had
imagined
herself
unobserved
and
many
other
nameless
little
circumstances
that
gave
him
a
strong
feeling
of
want
of
sincerity
in
his
stepmother
mrs
owen
brought
with
her
into
the
family
her
little
child
by
her
first
husband
a
boy
nearly
three
years
old
he
was
one
of
those
elfish
observant
mocking
children
over
whose
feelings
you
seem
to
have
no
control
agile
and
mischievous
his
little
practical
jokes
at
first
performed
in
ignorance
of
the
pain
he
gave
but
afterward
proceeding
to
a
malicious
pleasure
in
suffering
really
seemed
to
afford
some
ground
to
the
superstitious
notion
of
some
of
the
common
people
that
he
was
a
fairy
changeling
years
passed
on
and
as
owen
grew
older
he
became
more
observant
he
saw
even
in
his
occasional
visits
at
home
for
from
school
he
had
passed
on
to
college
that
a
great
change
had
taken
place
in
the
outward
manifestations
of
his
fatherâ€™s
character
and
by
degrees
owen
traced
this
change
to
the
influence
of
his
stepmother
so
slight
so
imperceptible
to
the
common
observer
yet
so
resistless
in
its
effects
squire
griffiths
caught
up
his
wifeâ€™s
humbly
advanced
opinions
and
unawares
to
himself
adopted
them
as
his
own
defying
all
argument
and
opposition
it
was
the
same
with
her
wishes
they
met
their
fulfilment
from
the
extreme
and
delicate
art
with
which
she
insinuated
them
into
her
husbandâ€™s
mind
as
his
own
she
sacrificed
the
show
of
authority
for
the
power
at
last
when
owen
perceived
some
oppressive
act
in
his
fatherâ€™s
conduct
toward
his
dependants
or
some
unaccountable
thwarting
of
his
own
wishes
he
fancied
he
saw
his
stepmotherâ€™s
secret
influence
thus
displayed
however
much
she
might
regret
the
injustice
of
his
fatherâ€™s
actions
in
her
conversations
with
him
when
they
were
alone
his
father
was
fast
losing
his
temperate
habits
and
frequent
intoxication
soon
took
its
usual
effect
upon
the
temper
yet
even
here
was
the
spell
of
his
wife
upon
him
before
her
he
placed
a
restraint
upon
his
passion
yet
she
was
perfectly
aware
of
his
irritable
disposition
and
directed
it
hither
and
thither
with
the
same
apparent
ignorance
of
the
tendency
of
her
words
meanwhile
owenâ€™s
situation
became
peculiarly
mortifying
to
a
youth
whose
early
remembrances
afforded
such
a
contrast
to
his
present
state
as
a
child
he
had
been
elevated
to
the
consequence
of
a
man
before
his
years
gave
any
mental
check
to
the
selfishness
which
such
conduct
was
likely
to
engender
he
could
remember
when
his
will
was
law
to
the
servants
and
dependants
and
his
sympathy
necessary
to
his
father
now
he
was
as
a
cipher
in
his
fatherâ€™s
house
and
the
squire
estranged
in
the
first
instance
by
a
feeling
of
the
injury
he
had
done
his
son
in
not
sooner
acquainting
him
with
his
purposed
marriage
seemed
rather
to
avoid
than
to
seek
him
as
a
companion
and
too
frequently
showed
the
most
utter
indifference
to
the
feelings
and
wishes
which
a
young
man
of
a
high
and
independent
spirit
might
be
supposed
to
indulge
perhaps
owen
was
not
fully
aware
of
the
force
of
all
these
circumstances
for
an
actor
in
a
family
drama
is
seldom
unimpassioned
enough
to
be
perfectly
observant
but
he
became
moody
and
soured
brooding
over
his
unloved
existence
and
craving
with
a
human
heart
after
sympathy
this
feeling
took
more
full
possession
of
his
mind
when
he
had
left
college
and
returned
home
to
lead
an
idle
and
purposeless
life
as
the
heir
there
was
no
worldly
necessity
for
exertion
his
father
was
too
much
of
a
welsh
squire
to
dream
of
the
moral
necessity
and
he
himself
had
not
sufficient
strength
of
mind
to
decide
at
once
upon
abandoning
a
place
and
mode
of
life
which
abounded
in
daily
mortifications
yet
to
this
course
his
judgment
was
slowly
tending
when
some
circumstances
occurred
to
detain
him
at
bodowen
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
harmony
would
long
be
preserved
even
in
appearance
between
an
unguarded
and
soured
young
man
such
as
owen
and
his
wary
stepmother
when
he
had
once
left
college
and
come
not
as
a
visitor
but
as
the
heir
to
his
fatherâ€™s
house
some
cause
of
difference
occurred
where
the
woman
subdued
her
hidden
anger
sufficiently
to
become
convinced
that
owen
was
not
entirely
the
dupe
she
had
believed
him
to
be
henceforward
there
was
no
peace
between
them
not
in
vulgar
altercations
did
this
show
itself
but
in
moody
reserve
on
owenâ€™s
part
and
in
undisguised
and
contemptuous
pursuance
of
her
own
plans
by
his
stepmother
bodowen
was
no
longer
a
place
where
if
owen
was
not
loved
or
attended
to
he
could
at
least
find
peace
and
care
for
himself
he
was
thwarted
at
every
step
and
in
every
wish
by
his
fatherâ€™s
desire
apparently
while
the
wife
sat
by
with
a
smile
of
triumph
on
her
beautiful
lips
so
owen
went
forth
at
the
early
day
dawn
sometimes
roaming
about
on
the
shore
or
the
upland
shooting
or
fishing
as
the
season
might
be
but
oftener
â€œstretched
in
indolent
reposeâ€
on
the
short
sweet
grass
indulging
in
gloomy
and
morbid
reveries
he
would
fancy
that
this
mortified
state
of
existence
was
a
dream
a
horrible
dream
from
which
he
should
awake
and
find
himself
again
the
sole
object
and
darling
of
his
father
and
then
he
would
start
up
and
strive
to
shake
off
the
incubus
there
was
the
molten
sunset
of
his
childish
memory
the
gorgeous
crimson
piles
of
glory
in
the
west
fading
away
into
the
cold
calm
light
of
the
rising
moon
while
here
and
there
a
cloud
floated
across
the
western
heaven
like
a
seraphâ€™s
wing
in
its
flaming
beauty
the
earth
was
the
same
as
in
his
childhoodâ€™s
days
full
of
gentle
evening
sounds
and
the
harmonies
of
twilightâ€”the
breeze
came
sweeping
low
over
the
heather
and
blue-bells
by
his
side
and
the
turf
was
sending
up
its
evening
incense
of
perfume
but
life
and
heart
and
hope
were
changed
for
ever
since
those
bygone
days
or
he
would
seat
himself
in
a
favourite
niche
of
the
rocks
on
moel
gãªst
hidden
by
a
stunted
growth
of
the
whitty
or
mountain-ash
from
general
observation
with
a
rich-tinted
cushion
of
stone-crop
for
his
feet
and
a
straight
precipice
of
rock
rising
just
above
here
would
he
sit
for
hours
gazing
idly
at
the
bay
below
with
its
back-ground
of
purple
hills
and
the
little
fishing-sail
on
its
bosom
showing
white
in
the
sunbeam
and
gliding
on
in
such
harmony
with
the
quiet
beauty
of
the
glassy
sea
or
he
would
pull
out
an
old
school-volume
his
companion
for
years
and
in
morbid
accordance
with
the
dark
legend
that
still
lurked
in
the
recesses
of
his
mindâ€”a
shape
of
gloom
in
those
innermost
haunts
awaiting
its
time
to
come
forth
in
distinct
outlineâ€”would
he
turn
to
the
old
greek
dramas
which
treat
of
a
family
foredoomed
by
an
avenging
fate
the
worn
page
opened
of
itself
at
the
play
of
the
å’dipus
tyrannus
and
owen
dwelt
with
the
craving
disease
upon
the
prophecy
so
nearly
resembling
that
which
concerned
himself
with
his
consciousness
of
neglect
there
was
a
sort
of
self-flattery
in
the
consequence
which
the
legend
gave
him
he
almost
wondered
how
they
durst
with
slights
and
insults
thus
provoke
the
avenger
the
days
drifted
onward
often
he
would
vehemently
pursue
some
sylvan
sport
till
thought
and
feeling
were
lost
in
the
violence
of
bodily
exertion
occasionally
his
evenings
were
spent
at
a
small
public-house
such
as
stood
by
the
unfrequented
wayside
where
the
welcome
hearty
though
bought
seemed
so
strongly
to
contrast
with
the
gloomy
negligence
of
homeâ€”unsympathising
home
one
evening
owen
might
be
four
or
five-and-twenty
wearied
with
a
dayâ€™s
shooting
on
the
clenneny
moors
he
passed
by
the
open
door
of
â€œthe
goatâ€
at
penmorfa
the
light
and
the
cheeriness
within
tempted
him
poor
self-exhausted
man
as
it
has
done
many
a
one
more
wretched
in
worldly
circumstances
to
step
in
and
take
his
evening
meal
where
at
least
his
presence
was
of
some
consequence
it
was
a
busy
day
in
that
little
hostel
a
flock
of
sheep
amounting
to
some
hundreds
had
arrived
at
penmorfa
on
their
road
to
england
and
thronged
the
space
before
the
house
inside
was
the
shrewd
kind-hearted
hostess
bustling
to
and
fro
with
merry
greetings
for
every
tired
drover
who
was
to
pass
the
night
in
her
house
while
the
sheep
were
penned
in
a
field
close
by
ever
and
anon
she
kept
attending
to
the
second
crowd
of
guests
who
were
celebrating
a
rural
wedding
in
her
house
it
was
busy
work
to
martha
thomas
yet
her
smile
never
flagged
and
when
owen
griffiths
had
finished
his
evening
meal
she
was
there
ready
with
a
hope
that
it
had
done
him
good
and
was
to
his
mind
and
a
word
of
intelligence
that
the
wedding-folk
were
about
to
dance
in
the
kitchen
and
the
harper
was
the
famous
edward
of
corwen
owen
partly
from
good-natured
compliance
with
his
hostessâ€™s
implied
wish
and
partly
from
curiosity
lounged
to
the
passage
which
led
to
the
kitchenâ€”not
the
every-day
working
cooking
kitchen
which
was
behind
but
a
good-sized
room
where
the
mistress
sat
when
her
work
was
done
and
where
the
country
people
were
commonly
entertained
at
such
merry-makings
as
the
present
the
lintels
of
the
door
formed
a
frame
for
the
animated
picture
which
owen
saw
within
as
he
leaned
against
the
wall
in
the
dark
passage
the
red
light
of
the
fire
with
every
now
and
then
a
falling
piece
of
turf
sending
forth
a
fresh
blaze
shone
full
upon
four
young
men
who
were
dancing
a
measure
something
like
a
scotch
reel
keeping
admirable
time
in
their
rapid
movements
to
the
capital
tune
the
harper
was
playing
they
had
their
hats
on
when
owen
first
took
his
stand
but
as
they
grew
more
and
more
animated
they
flung
them
away
and
presently
their
shoes
were
kicked
off
with
like
disregard
to
the
spot
where
they
might
happen
to
alight
shouts
of
applause
followed
any
remarkable
exertion
of
agility
in
which
each
seemed
to
try
to
excel
his
companions
at
length
wearied
and
exhausted
they
sat
down
and
the
harper
gradually
changed
to
one
of
those
wild
inspiring
national
airs
for
which
he
was
so
famous
the
thronged
audience
sat
earnest
and
breathless
and
you
might
have
heard
a
pin
drop
except
when
some
maiden
passed
hurriedly
with
flaring
candle
and
busy
look
through
to
the
real
kitchen
beyond
when
he
had
finished
his
beautiful
theme
on
â€œthe
march
of
the
men
of
harlechâ€
he
changed
the
measure
again
to
â€œtri
chant
oâ€™
bunnanâ€
three
hundred
pounds
and
immediately
a
most
unmusical-looking
man
began
chanting
â€œpennillionâ€
or
a
sort
of
recitative
stanzas
which
were
soon
taken
up
by
another
and
this
amusement
lasted
so
long
that
owen
grew
weary
and
was
thinking
of
retreating
from
his
post
by
the
door
when
some
little
bustle
was
occasioned
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
by
the
entrance
of
a
middle-aged
man
and
a
young
girl
apparently
his
daughter
the
man
advanced
to
the
bench
occupied
by
the
seniors
of
the
party
who
welcomed
him
with
the
usual
pretty
welsh
greeting
â€œpa
sut
mae
dy
galonâ€
â€œhow
is
thy
heartâ€
and
drinking
his
health
passed
on
to
him
the
cup
of
excellent
cwrw
the
girl
evidently
a
village
belle
was
as
warmly
greeted
by
the
young
men
while
the
girls
eyed
her
rather
askance
with
a
half-jealous
look
which
owen
set
down
to
the
score
of
her
extreme
prettiness
like
most
welsh
women
she
was
of
middle
size
as
to
height
but
beautifully
made
with
the
most
perfect
yet
delicate
roundness
in
every
limb
her
little
mob-cap
was
carefully
adjusted
to
a
face
which
was
excessively
pretty
though
it
never
could
be
called
handsome
it
also
was
round
with
the
slightest
tendency
to
the
oval
shape
richly
coloured
though
somewhat
olive
in
complexion
with
dimples
in
cheek
and
chin
and
the
most
scarlet
lips
owen
had
ever
seen
that
were
too
short
to
meet
over
the
small
pearly
teeth
the
nose
was
the
most
defective
feature
but
the
eyes
were
splendid
they
were
so
long
so
lustrous
yet
at
times
so
very
soft
under
their
thick
fringe
of
eyelash
the
nut-brown
hair
was
carefully
braided
beneath
the
border
of
delicate
lace
it
was
evident
the
little
village
beauty
knew
how
to
make
the
most
of
all
her
attractions
for
the
gay
colours
which
were
displayed
in
her
neckerchief
were
in
complete
harmony
with
the
complexion
owen
was
much
attracted
while
yet
he
was
amused
by
the
evident
coquetry
the
girl
displayed
collecting
around
her
a
whole
bevy
of
young
fellows
for
each
of
whom
she
seemed
to
have
some
gay
speech
some
attractive
look
or
action
in
a
few
minutes
young
griffiths
of
bodowen
was
at
her
side
brought
thither
by
a
variety
of
idle
motives
and
as
her
undivided
attention
was
given
to
the
welsh
heir
her
admirers
one
by
one
dropped
off
to
seat
themselves
by
some
less
fascinating
but
more
attentive
fair
one
the
more
owen
conversed
with
the
girl
the
more
he
was
taken
she
had
more
wit
and
talent
than
he
had
fancied
possible
a
self-abandon
and
thoughtfulness
to
boot
that
seemed
full
of
charms
and
then
her
voice
was
so
clear
and
sweet
and
her
actions
so
full
of
grace
that
owen
was
fascinated
before
he
was
well
aware
and
kept
looking
into
her
bright
blushing
face
till
her
uplifted
flashing
eye
fell
beneath
his
earnest
gaze
while
it
thus
happened
that
they
were
silentâ€”she
from
confusion
at
the
unexpected
warmth
of
his
admiration
he
from
an
unconsciousness
of
anything
but
the
beautiful
changes
in
her
flexile
countenanceâ€”the
man
whom
owen
took
for
her
father
came
up
and
addressed
some
observation
to
his
daughter
from
whence
he
glided
into
some
commonplace
though
respectful
remark
to
owen
and
at
length
engaging
him
in
some
slight
local
conversation
he
led
the
way
to
the
account
of
a
spot
on
the
peninsula
of
penthryn
where
teal
abounded
and
concluded
with
begging
owen
to
allow
him
to
show
him
the
exact
place
saying
that
whenever
the
young
squire
felt
so
inclined
if
he
would
honour
him
by
a
call
at
his
house
he
would
take
him
across
in
his
boat
while
owen
listened
his
attention
was
not
so
much
absorbed
as
to
be
unaware
that
the
little
beauty
at
his
side
was
refusing
one
or
two
who
endeavoured
to
draw
her
from
her
place
by
invitations
to
dance
flattered
by
his
own
construction
of
her
refusals
he
again
directed
all
his
attention
to
her
till
she
was
called
away
by
her
father
who
was
leaving
the
scene
of
festivity
before
he
left
he
reminded
owen
of
his
promise
and
addedâ€”
â€œperhaps
sir
you
do
not
know
me
my
name
is
ellis
pritchard
and
i
live

glas

of

out
to

when
the
father
and
daughter
had
left
owen
slowly
prepared
for
his
ride
home
but
encountering
the
hostess
he
could
not
resist
asking
a
few
questions
relative
to
ellis
pritchard
and
his
pretty
daughter
she
answered
shortly
but
respectfully
and
then
said
rather
hesitatinglyâ€”
â€œmaster

three
things
are
alike
a
fine
barn
without
corn
a
fine
cup
without
drink
a
fine
woman
without
her
reputationâ€
she
hastily
quitted
him
and
owen
rode
slowly
to
his
unhappy
home
ellis
pritchard
half
farmer
and
half
fisherman
was
shrewd
and
keen
and
worldly
yet
he
was
good-natured
and
sufficiently
generous
to
have
become
rather
a
popular
man
among
his
equals
he
had
been
struck
with
the
young
squireâ€™s
attention
to
his
pretty
daughter
and
was
not
insensible
to
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
it
nest
would
not
be
the
first
peasant
girl
by
any
means
who
had
been
transplanted
to
a
welsh
manor-house
as
its
mistress
and
accordingly
her
father
had
shrewdly
given
the
admiring
young
man
some
pretext
for
further
opportunities
of
seeing
her
as
for
nest
herself
she
had
somewhat
of
her
fatherâ€™s
worldliness
and
was
fully
alive
to
the
superior
station
of
her
new
admirer
and
quite
prepared
to
slight
all
her
old
sweethearts
on
his
account
but
then
she
had
something
more
of
feeling
in
her
reckoning
she
had
not
been
insensible
to
the
earnest
yet
comparatively
refined
homage
which
owen
paid
her
she
had
noticed
his
expressive
and
occasionally
handsome
countenance
with
admiration
and
was
flattered
by
his
so
immediately
singling
her
out
from
her
companions
as
to
the
hint
which
martha
thomas
had
thrown
out
it
is
enough
to
say
that
nest
was
very
giddy
and
that
she
was
motherless
she
had
high
spirits
and
a
great
love
of
admiration
or
to
use
a
softer
term
she
loved
to
please
men
women
and
children
all
she
delighted
to
gladden
with
her
smile
and
voice
she
coquetted
and
flirted
and
went
to
the
extreme
lengths
of
welsh
courtship
till
the
seniors
of
the
village
shook
their
heads
and
cautioned
their
daughters
against
her
acquaintance
if
not
absolutely
guilty
she
had
too
frequently
been
on
the
verge
of
guilt
even
at
the
time
martha
thomasâ€™s
hint
made
but
little
impression
on
owen
for
his
senses
were
otherwise
occupied
but
in
a
few
days
the
recollection
thereof
had
wholly
died
away
and
one
warm
glorious
summerâ€™s
day
he
bent
his
steps
toward
ellis
pritchardâ€™s
with
a
beating
heart
for
except
some
very
slight
flirtations
at
oxford
owen
had
never
been
touched
his
thoughts
his
fancy
had
been
otherwise
engaged
ty
glas
was
built
against
one
of
the
lower
rocks
of
moel
gãªst
which
indeed
formed
a
side
to
the
low
lengthy
house
the
materials
of
the
cottage
were
the
shingly
stones
which
had
fallen
from
above
plastered
rudely
together
with
deep
recesses
for
the
small
oblong
windows
altogether
the
exterior
was
much
ruder
than
owen
had
expected
but
inside
there
seemed
no
lack
of
comforts
the
house
was
divided
into
two
apartments
one
large
roomy
and
dark
into
which
owen
entered
immediately
and
before
the
blushing
nest
came
from
the
inner
chamber
for
she
had
seen
the
young
squire
coming
and
hastily
gone
to
make
some
alteration
in
her
dress
he
had
had
time
to
look
around
him
and
note
the
various
little
particulars
of
the
room
beneath
the
window
which
commanded
a
magnificent
view
was
an
oaken
dresser
replete
with
drawers
and
cupboards
and
brightly
polished
to
a
rich
dark
colour
in
the
farther
part
of
the
room
owen
could
at
first
distinguish
little
entering
as
he
did
from
the
glaring
sunlight
but
he
soon
saw
that
there
were
two
oaken
beds
closed
up
after
the
manner
of
the
welsh
in
fact
the
domitories
of
ellis
pritchard
and
the
man
who
served
under
him
both
on
sea
and
on
land
there
was
the
large
wheel
used
for
spinning
wool
left
standing
on
the
middle
of
the
floor
as
if
in
use
only
a
few
minutes
before
and
around
the
ample
chimney
hung
flitches
of
bacon
dried
kidsâ€™-flesh
and
fish
that
was
in
process
of
smoking
for
winterâ€™s
store
before
nest
had
shyly
dared
to
enter
her
father
who
had
been
mending
his
nets
down
below
and
seen
owen
winding
up
to
the
house
came
in
and
gave
him
a
hearty
yet
respectful
welcome
and
then
nest
downcast
and
blushing
full
of
the
consciousness
which
her
fatherâ€™s
advice
and
conversation
had
not
failed
to
inspire
ventured
to
join
them
to
owenâ€™s
mind
this
reserve
and
shyness
gave
her
new
charms
it
was
too
bright
too
hot
too
anything
to
think
of
going
to
shoot
teal
till
later
in
the
day
and
owen
was
delighted
to
accept
a
hesitating
invitation
to
share
the
noonday
meal
some
ewe-milk
cheese
very
hard
and
dry
oat-cake
slips
of
the
dried
kidsâ€™-flesh
broiled
after
having
been
previously
soaked
in
water
for
a
few
minutes
delicious
butter
and
fresh
butter-milk
with
a
liquor
called
â€œdiod
griafolâ€
made
from
the
berries
of
the
sorbus
aucuparia
infused
in
water
and
then
fermented
composed
the
frugal
repast
but
there
was
something
so
clean
and
neat
and
withal
such
a
true
welcome
that
owen
had
seldom
enjoyed
a
meal
so
much
indeed
at
that
time
of
day
the
welsh
squires
differed
from
the
farmers
more
in
the
plenty
and
rough
abundance
of
their
manner
of
living
than
in
the
refinement
of
style
of
their
table
at
the
present
day
down
in
llyn
the
welsh
gentry
are
not
a
wit
behind
their
saxon
equals
in
the
expensive
elegances
of
life
but
then
when
there
was
but
one
pewter-service
in
all
northumberland
there
was
nothing
in
ellis
pritchardâ€™s
mode
of
living
that
grated
on
the
young
squireâ€™s
sense
of
refinement
little
was
said
by
that
young
pair
of
wooers
during
the
meal
the
father
had
all
the
conversation
to
himself
apparently
heedless
of
the
ardent
looks
and
inattentive
mien
of
his
guest
as
owen
became
more
serious
in
his
feelings
he
grew
more
timid
in
their
expression
and
at
night
when
they
returned
from
their
shooting-excursion
the
caress
he
gave
nest
was
almost
as
bashfully
offered
as
received
this
was
but
the
first
of
a
series
of
days
devoted
to
nest
in
reality
though
at
first
he
thought
some
little
disguise
of
his
object
was
necessary
the
past
the
future
was
all
forgotten
in
those
happy
days
of
love
and
every
worldly
plan
every
womanly
wile
was
put
in
practice
by
ellis
pritchard
and
his
daughter
to
render
his
visits
agreeable
and
alluring
indeed
the
very
circumstance
of
his
being
welcome
was
enough
to
attract
the
poor
young
man
to
whom
the
feeling
so
produced
was
new
and
full
of
charms
he
left
a
home
where
the
certainty
of
being
thwarted
made
him
chary
in
expressing
his
wishes
where
no
tones
of
love
ever
fell
on
his
ear
save
those
addressed
to
others
where
his
presence
or
absence
was
a
matter
of
utter
indifference
and
when
he
entered
ty
glas
all
down
to
the
little
cur
which
with
clamorous
barkings
claimed
a
part
of
his
attention
seemed
to
rejoice
his
account
of
his
dayâ€™s
employment
found
a
willing
listener
in
ellis
and
when
he
passed
on
to
nest
busy
at
her
wheel
or
at
her
churn
the
deepened
colour
the
conscious
eye
and
the
gradual
yielding
of
herself
up
to
his
lover-like
caress
had
worlds
of
charms
ellis
pritchard
was
a
tenant
on
the
bodowen
estate
and
therefore
had
reasons
in
plenty
for
wishing
to
keep
the
young
squireâ€™s
visits
secret
and
owen
unwilling
to
disturb
the
sunny
calm
of
these
halcyon
days
by
any
storm
at
home
was
ready
to
use
all
the
artifice
which
ellis
suggested
as
to
the
mode
of
his
calls
at
ty
glas
nor
was
he
unaware
of
the
probable
nay
the
hoped-for
termination
of
these
repeated
days
of
happiness
he
was
quite
conscious
that
the
father
wished
for
nothing
better
than
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
to
the
heir
of
bodowen
and
when
nest
had
hidden
her
face
in
his
neck
which
was
encircled
by
her
clasping
arms
and
murmured
into
his
ear
her
acknowledgment
of
love
he
felt
only
too
desirous
of
finding
some
one
to
love
him
for
ever
though
not
highly
principled
he
would
not
have
tried
to
obtain
nest
on
other
terms
save
those
of
marriage
he
did
so
pine
after
enduring
love
and
fancied
he
should
have
bound
her
heart
for
evermore
to
his
when
they
had
taken
the
solemn
oaths
of
matrimony
there
was
no
great
difficulty
attending
a
secret
marriage
at
such
a
place
and
at
such
a
time
one
gusty
autumn
day
ellis
ferried
them
round
penthryn
to
llandutrwyn
and
there
saw
his
little
nest
become
future
lady
of
bodowen
how
often
do
we
see
giddy
coquetting
restless
girls
become
sobered
by
marriage
a
great
object
in
life
is
decided
one
on
which
their
thoughts
have
been
running
in
all
their
vagaries
and
they
seem
to
verify
the
beautiful
fable
of
undine
a
new
soul
beams
out
in
the
gentleness
and
repose
of
their
future
lives
an
indescribable
softness
and
tenderness
takes
place
of
the
wearying
vanity
of
their
former
endeavours
to
attract
admiration
something
of
this
sort
took
place
in
nest
pritchard
if
at
first
she
had
been
anxious
to
attract
the
young
squire
of
bodowen
long
before
her
marriage
this
feeling
had
merged
into
a
truer
love
than
she
had
ever
felt
before
and
now
that
he
was
her
own
her
husband
her
whole
soul
was
bent
toward
making
him
amends
as
far
as
in
her
lay
for
the
misery
which
with
a
womanâ€™s
tact
she
saw
that
he
had
to
endure
at
his
home
her
greetings
were
abounding
in
delicately-expressed
love
her
study
of
his
tastes
unwearying
in
the
arrangement
of
her
dress
her
time
her
very
thoughts
no
wonder
that
he
looked
back
on
his
wedding-day
with
a
thankfulness
which
is
seldom
the
result
of
unequal
marriages
no
wonder
that
his
heart
beat
aloud
as
formerly
when
he
wound
up
the
little
path
to
ty
glas
and
sawâ€”keen
though
the
winterâ€™s
wind
might
beâ€”that
nest
was
standing
out
at
the
door
to
watch
for
his
dimly-seen
approach
while
the
candle
flared
in
the
little
window
as
a
beacon
to
guide
him
aright
the
angry
words
and
unkind
actions
of
home
fell
deadened
on
his
heart
he
thought
of
the
love
that
was
surely
his
and
of
the
new
promise
of
love
that
a
short
time
would
bring
forth
and
he
could
almost
have
smiled
at
the
impotent
efforts
to
disturb
his
peace
a
few
more
months
and
the
young
father
was
greeted
by
a
feeble
little
cry
when
he
hastily
entered
ty
glas
one
morning
early
in
consequence
of
a
summons
conveyed
mysteriously
to
bodowen
and
the
pale
mother
smiling
and
feebly
holding
up
her
babe
to
its
fatherâ€™s
kiss
seemed
to
him
even
more
lovely
than
the
bright
gay
nest
who
had
won
his
heart
at
the
little
inn
of
penmorfa
but
the
curse
was
at
work
the
fulfilment
of
the
prophecy
was
nigh
at
hand
it
was
the
autumn
after
the
birth
of
their
boy
it
had
been
a
glorious
summer
with
bright
hot
sunny
weather
and
now
the
year
was
fading
away
as
seasonably
into
mellow
days
with
mornings
of
silver
mists
and
clear
frosty
nights
the
blooming
look
of
the
time
of
flowers
was
past
and
gone
but
instead
there
were
even
richer
tints
abroad
in
the
sun-coloured
leaves
the
lichens
the
golden
blossomed
furze
if
it
was
the
time
of
fading
there
was
a
glory
in
the
decay
nest
in
her
loving
anxiety
to
surround
her
dwelling
with
every
charm
for
her
husbandâ€™s
sake
had
turned
gardener
and
the
little
corners
of
the
rude
court
before
the
house
were
filled
with
many
a
delicate
mountain-flower
transplanted
more
for
its
beauty
than
its
rarity
the
sweetbrier
bush
may
even
yet
be
seen
old
and
gray
which
she
and
owen
planted
a
green
slipling
beneath
the
window
of
her
little
chamber
in
those
moments
owen
forgot
all
besides
the
present
all
the
cares
and
griefs
he
had
known
in
the
past
and
all
that
might
await
him
of
woe
and
death
in
the
future
the
boy
too
was
as
lovely
a
child
as
the
fondest
parent
was
ever
blessed
with
and
crowed
with
delight
and
clapped
his
little
hands
as
his
mother
held
him
in
her
arms
at
the
cottage-door
to
watch
his
fatherâ€™s
ascent
up
the
rough
path
that
led
to
ty
glas
one
bright
autumnal
morning
and
when
the
three
entered
the
house
together
it
was
difficult
to
say
which
was
the
happiest
owen
carried
his
boy
and
tossed
and
played
with
him
while
nest
sought
out
some
little
article
of
work
and
seated
herself
on
the
dresser
beneath
the
window
where
now
busily
plying
the
needle
and
then
again
looking
at
her
husband
she
eagerly
told
him
the
little
pieces
of
domestic
intelligence
the
winning
ways
of
the
child
the
result
of
yesterdayâ€™s
fishing
and
such
of
the
gossip
of
penmorfa
as
came
to
the
ears
of
the
now
retired
nest
she
noticed
that
when
she
mentioned
any
little
circumstance
which
bore
the
slightest
reference
to
bodowen
her
husband
appeared
chafed
and
uneasy
and
at
last
avoided
anything
that
might
in
the
least
remind
him
of
home
in
truth
he
had
been
suffering
much
of
late
from
the
irritability
of
his
father
shown
in
trifles
to
be
sure
but
not
the
less
galling
on
that
account
while
they
were
thus
talking
and
caressing
each
other
and
the
child
a
shadow
darkened
the
room
and
before
they
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
object
that
had
occasioned
it
it
vanished
and
squire
griffiths
lifted
the
door-latch
and
stood
before
them
he
stood
and
lookedâ€”first
on
his
son
so
different
in
his
buoyant
expression
of
content
and
enjoyment
with
his
noble
child
in
his
arms
like
a
proud
and
happy
father
as
he
was
from
the
depressed
moody
young
man
he
too
often
appeared
at
bodowen
then
on
nestâ€”poor
trembling
sickened
nestâ€”who
dropped
her
work
but
yet
durst
not
stir
from
her
seat
on
the
dresser
while
she
looked
to
her
husband
as
if
for
protection
from
his
father
the
squire
was
silent
as
he
glared
from
one
to
the
other
his
features
white
with
restrained
passion
when
he
spoke
his
words
came
most
distinct
in
their
forced
composure
it
was
to
his
son
he
addressed
himself
â€œthat
woman
who
is
sheâ€
owen
hesitated
one
moment
and
then
replied
in
a
steady
yet
quiet
voice
â€œfather
that
woman
is
my
wifeâ€
he
would
have
added
some
apology
for
the
long
concealment
of
his
marriage
have
appealed
to
his
fatherâ€™s
forgiveness
but
the
foam
flew
from
squire
owenâ€™s
lips
as
he
burst
forth
with
invective
against
nestâ€”
â€œyou
have
married
her
it
is
as
they
told
me
married
nest
pritchard
yr
buten
and
you
stand
there
as
if
you
had
not
disgraced
yourself
for
ever
and
ever
with
your
accursed
wiving
and
the
fair
harlot
sits
there
in
her
mocking
modesty
practising
the
mimming
airs
that
will
become
her
state
as
future
lady
of
bodowen
but
i
will
move
heaven
and
earth
before
that
false
woman
darken
the
doors
of
my
fatherâ€™s
house
as
mistressâ€
all
this
was
said
with
such
rapidity
that
owen
had
no
time
for
the
words
that
thronged
to
his
lips
â€œfatherâ€
he
burst
forth
at
length
â€œfather
whosoever
told
you
that
nest
pritchard
was
a
harlot
told
you
a
lie
as
false
as
hell
ay
a
lie
as
false
as
hellâ€
he
added
in
a
voice
of
thunder
while
he
advanced
a
step
or
two
nearer
to
the
squire
and
then
in
a
lower
tone
he
saidâ€”
â€œshe
is
as
pure
as
your
own
wife
nay
god
help
me
as
the
dear
precious
mother
who
brought
me
forth
and
then
left
meâ€”with
no
refuge
in
a
motherâ€™s
heartâ€”to
struggle
on
through
life
alone
i
tell
you
nest
is
as
pure
as
that
dear
dead
motherâ€
â€œfoolâ€”poor
foolâ€
at
this
moment
the
childâ€”the
little
owenâ€”who
had
kept
gazing
from
one
angry
countenance
to
the
other
and
with
earnest
look
trying
to
understand
what
had
brought
the
fierce
glare
into
the
face
where
till
now
he
had
read
nothing
but
love
in
some
way
attracted
the
squireâ€™s
attention
and
increased
his
wrath
â€œyesâ€
he
continued
â€œpoor
weak
fool
that
you
are
hugging
the
child
of
another
as
if
it
were
your
own
offspringâ€
owen
involuntarily
caressed
the
affrighted
child
and
half
smiled
at
the
implication
of
his
fatherâ€™s
words
this
the
squire
perceived
and
raising
his
voice
to
a
scream
of
rage
he
went
on
â€œi
bid
you
if
you
call
yourself
my
son
to
cast
away
that
miserable
shameless
womanâ€™s
offspring
cast
it
away
this
instantâ€”this
instantâ€
in
this
ungovernable
rage
seeing
that
owen
was
far
from
complying
with
his
command
he
snatched
the
poor
infant
from
the
loving
arms
that
held
it
and
throwing
it
to
his
mother
left
the
house
inarticulate
with
fury
nestâ€”who
had
been
pale
and
still
as
marble
during
this
terrible
dialogue
looking
on
and
listening
as
if
fascinated
by
the
words
that
smote
her
heartâ€”opened
her
arms
to
receive
and
cherish
her
precious
babe
but
the
boy
was
not
destined
to
reach
the
white
refuge
of
her
breast
the
furious
action
of
the
squire
had
been
almost
without
aim
and
the
infant
fell
against
the
sharp
edge
of
the
dresser
down
on
to
the
stone
floor
owen
sprang
up
to
take
the
child
but
he
lay
so
still
so
motionless
that
the
awe
of
death
came
over
the
father
and
he
stooped
down
to
gaze
more
closely
at
that
moment
the
upturned
filmy
eyes
rolled
convulsivelyâ€”a
spasm
passed
along
the
bodyâ€”and
the
lips
yet
warm
with
kissing
quivered
into
everlasting
rest
a
word
from
her
husband
told
nest
all
she
slid
down
from
her
seat
and
lay
by
her
little
son
as
corpse-like
as
he
unheeding
all
the
agonizing
endearments
and
passionate
adjurations
of
her
husband
and
that
poor
desolate
husband
and
father
scarce
one
little
quarter
of
an
hour
and
he
had
been
so
blessed
in
his
consciousness
of
love
the
bright
promise
of
many
years
on
his
infantâ€™s
face
and
the
new
fresh
soul
beaming
forth
in
its
awakened
intelligence
and
there
it
was
the
little
clay
image
that
would
never
more
gladden
up
at
the
sight
of
him
nor
stretch
forth
to
meet
his
embrace
whose
inarticulate
yet
most
eloquent
cooings
might
haunt
him
in
his
dreams
but
would
never
more
be
heard
in
waking
life
again
and
by
the
dead
babe
almost
as
utterly
insensate
the
poor
mother
had
fallen
in
a
merciful
faintâ€”the
slandered
heart-pierced
nest
owen
struggled
against
the
sickness
that
came
over
him
and
busied
himself
in
vain
attempts
at
her
restoration
it
was
now
near
noon-day
and
ellis
pritchard
came
home
little
dreaming
of
the
sight
that
awaited
him
but
though
stunned
he
was
able
to
take
more
effectual
measures
for
his
poor
daughterâ€™s
recovery
than
owen
had
done
by-and-by
she
showed
symptoms
of
returning
sense
and
was
placed
in
her
own
little
bed
in
a
darkened
room
where
without
ever
waking
to
complete
consciousness
she
fell
asleep
then
it
was
that
her
husband
suffocated
by
pressure
of
miserable
thought
gently
drew
his
hand
from
her
tightened
clasp
and
printing
one
long
soft
kiss
on
her
white
waxen
forehead
hastily
stole
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
house
near
the
base
of
moel
gãªstâ€”it
might
be
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
ty
glasâ€”was
a
little
neglected
solitary
copse
wild
and
tangled
with
the
trailing
branches
of
the
dog-rose
and
the
tendrils
of
the
white
bryony
toward
the
middle
of
this
thicket
a
deep
crystal
poolâ€”a
clear
mirror
for
the
blue
heavens
aboveâ€”and
round
the
margin
floated
the
broad
green
leaves
of
the
water-lily
and
when
the
regal
sun
shone
down
in
his
noonday
glory
the
flowers
arose
from
their
cool
depths
to
welcome
and
greet
him
the
copse
was
musical
with
many
sounds
the
warbling
of
birds
rejoicing
in
its
shades
the
ceaseless
hum
of
the
insects
that
hovered
over
the
pool
the
chime
of
the
distant
waterfall
the
occasional
bleating
of
the
sheep
from
the
mountaintop
were
all
blended
into
the
delicious
harmony
of
nature
it
had
been
one
of
owenâ€™s
favourite
resorts
when
he
had
been
a
lonely
wandererâ€”a
pilgrim
in
search
of
love
in
the
years
gone
by
and
thither
he
went
as
if
by
instinct
when
he
left
ty
glas
quelling
the
uprising
agony
till
he
should
reach
that
little
solitary
spot
it
was
the
time
of
day
when
a
change
in
the
aspect
of
the
weather
so
frequently
takes
place
and
the
little
pool
was
no
longer
the
reflection
of
a
blue
and
sunny
sky
it
sent
back
the
dark
and
slaty
clouds
above
and
every
now
and
then
a
rough
gust
shook
the
painted
autumn
leaves
from
their
branches
and
all
other
music
was
lost
in
the
sound
of
the
wild
winds
piping
down
from
the
moorlands
which
lay
up
and
beyond
the
clefts
in
the
mountain-side
presently
the
rain
came
on
and
beat
down
in
torrents
but
owen
heeded
it
not
he
sat
on
the
dank
ground
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
and
his
whole
strength
physical
and
mental
employed
in
quelling
the
rush
of
blood
which
rose
and
boiled
and
gurgled
in
his
brain
as
if
it
would
madden
him
the
phantom
of
his
dead
child
rose
ever
before
him
and
seemed
to
cry
aloud
for
vengeance
and
when
the
poor
young
man
thought
upon
the
victim
whom
he
required
in
his
wild
longing
for
revenge
he
shuddered
for
it
was
his
father
again
and
again
he
tried
not
to
think
but
still
the
circle
of
thought
came
round
eddying
through
his
brain
at
length
he
mastered
his
passions
and
they
were
calm
then
he
forced
himself
to
arrange
some
plan
for
the
future
he
had
not
in
the
passionate
hurry
of
the
moment
seen
that
his
father
had
left
the
cottage
before
he
was
aware
of
the
fatal
accident
that
befell
the
child
owen
thought
he
had
seen
all
and
once
he
planned
to
go
to
the
squire
and
tell
him
of
the
anguish
of
heart
he
had
wrought
and
awe
him
as
it
were
by
the
dignity
of
grief
but
then
again
he
durst
notâ€”he
distrusted
his
self-controlâ€”the
old
prophecy
rose
up
in
its
horrorâ€”he
dreaded
his
doom
at
last
he
determined
to
leave
his
father
for
ever
to
take
nest
to
some
distant
country
where
she
might
forget
her
firstborn
and
where
he
himself
might
gain
a
livelihood
by
his
own
exertions
but
when
he
tried
to
descend
to
the
various
little
arrangements
which
were
involved
in
the
execution
of
this
plan
he
remembered
that
all
his
money
and
in
this
respect
squire
griffiths
was
no
niggard
was
locked
up
in
his
escritoire
at
bodowen
in
vain
he
tried
to
do
away
with
this
matter-of-fact
difficulty
go
to
bodowen
he
must
and
his
only
hopeâ€”nay
his
determinationâ€”was
to
avoid
his
father
he
rose
and
took
a
by-path
to
bodowen
the
house
looked
even
more
gloomy
and
desolate
than
usual
in
the
heavy
down-pouring
rain
yet
owen
gazed
on
it
with
something
of
regretâ€”for
sorrowful
as
his
days
in
it
had
been
he
was
about
to
leave
it
for
many
many
years
if
not
for
ever
he
entered
by
a
side
door
opening
into
a
passage
that
led
to
his
own
room
where
he
kept
his
books
his
guns
his
fishing-tackle
his
writing
materials
et
cetera
here
he
hurriedly
began
to
select
the
few
articles
he
intended
to
take
for
besides
the
dread
of
interruption
he
was
feverishly
anxious
to
travel
far
that
very
night
if
only
nest
was
capable
of
performing
the
journey
as
he
was
thus
employed
he
tried
to
conjecture
what
his
fatherâ€™s
feelings
would
be
on
finding
that
his
once-loved
son
was
gone
away
for
ever
would
he
then
awaken
to
regret
for
the
conduct
which
had
driven
him
from
home
and
bitterly
think
on
the
loving
and
caressing
boy
who
haunted
his
footsteps
in
former
days
or
alas
would
he
only
feel
that
an
obstacle
to
his
daily
happinessâ€”to
his
contentment
with
his
wife
and
his
strange
doting
affection
for
the
childâ€”was
taken
away
would
they
make
merry
over
the
heirâ€™s
departure
then
he
thought
of
nestâ€”the
young
childless
mother
whose
heart
had
not
yet
realized
her
fulness
of
desolation
poor
nest
so
loving
as
she
was
so
devoted
to
her
childâ€”how
should
he
console
her
he
pictured
her
away
in
a
strange
land
pining
for
her
native
mountains
and
refusing
to
be
comforted
because
her
child
was
not
even
this
thought
of
the
home-sickness
that
might
possibly
beset
nest
hardly
made
him
hesitate
in
his
determination
so
strongly
had
the
idea
taken
possession
of
him
that
only
by
putting
miles
and
leagues
between
him
and
his
father
could
he
avert
the
doom
which
seemed
blending
itself
with
the
very
purposes
of
his
life
as
long
as
he
stayed
in
proximity
with
the
slayer
of
his
child
he
had
now
nearly
completed
his
hasty
work
of
preparation
and
was
full
of
tender
thoughts
of
his
wife
when
the
door
opened
and
the
elfish
robert
peered
in
in
search
of
some
of
his
brotherâ€™s
possessions
on
seeing
owen
he
hesitated
but
then
came
boldly
forward
and
laid
his
hand
on
owenâ€™s
arm
saying
â€œnesta
yr
buten
how
is
nest
yr
butenâ€
he
looked
maliciously
into
owenâ€™s
face
to
mark
the
effect
of
his
words
but
was
terrified
at
the
expression
he
read
there
he
started
off
and
ran
to
the
door
while
owen
tried
to
check
himself
saying
continually
â€œhe
is
but
a
child
he
does
not
understand
the
meaning
of
what
he
says
he
is
but
a
childâ€
still
robert
now
in
fancied
security
kept
calling
out
his
insulting
words
and
owenâ€™s
hand
was
on
his
gun
grasping
it
as
if
to
restrain
his
rising
fury
but
when
robert
passed
on
daringly
to
mocking
words
relating
to
the
poor
dead
child
owen
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
before
the
boy
was
well
aware
owen
was
fiercely
holding
him
in
an
iron
clasp
with
one
hand
while
he
struck
him
hard
with
the
other
in
a
minute
he
checked
himself
he
paused
relaxed
his
grasp
and
to
his
horror
he
saw
robert
sink
to
the
ground
in
fact
the
lad
was
half-stunned
half-frightened
and
thought
it
best
to
assume
insensibility
owenâ€”miserable
owenâ€”seeing
him
lie
there
prostrate
was
bitterly
repentant
and
would
have
dragged
him
to
the
carved
settle
and
done
all
he
could
to
restore
him
to
his
senses
but
at
this
instant
the
squire
came
in
probably
when
the
household
at
bodowen
rose
that
morning
there
was
but
one
among
them
ignorant
of
the
heirâ€™s
relation
to
nest
pritchard
and
her
child
for
secret
as
he
tried
to
make
his
visits
to
ty
glas
they
had
been
too
frequent
not
to
be
noticed
and
nestâ€™s
altered
conductâ€”no
longer
frequenting
dances
and
merry-makingsâ€”was
a
strongly
corroborative
circumstance
but
mrs
griffithsâ€™
influence
reigned
paramount
if
unacknowledged
at
bodowen
and
till
she
sanctioned
the
disclosure
none
would
dare
to
tell
the
squire
now
however
the
time
drew
near
when
it
suited
her
to
make
her
husband
aware
of
the
connection
his
son
had
formed
so
with
many
tears
and
much
seeming
reluctance
she
broke
the
intelligence
to
himâ€”taking
good
care
at
the
same
time
to
inform
him
of
the
light
character
nest
had
borne
nor
did
she
confine
this
evil
reputation
to
her
conduct
before
her
marriage
but
insinuated
that
even
to
this
day
she
was
a
â€œwoman
of
the
grove
and
brakeâ€â€”for
centuries
the
welsh
term
of
opprobrium
for
the
loosest
female
characters
squire
griffiths
easily
tracked
owen
to
ty
glas
and
without
any
aim
but
the
gratification
of
his
furious
anger
followed
him
to
upbraid
as
we
have
seen
but
he
left
the
cottage
even
more
enraged
against
his
son
than
he
had
entered
it
and
returned
home
to
hear
the
evil
suggestions
of
the
stepmother
he
had
heard
a
slight
scuffle
in
which
he
caught
the
tones
of
robertâ€™s
voice
as
he
passed
along
the
hall
and
an
instant
afterwards
he
saw
the
apparently
lifeless
body
of
his
little
favourite
dragged
along
by
the
culprit
owenâ€”the
marks
of
strong
passion
yet
visible
on
his
face
not
loud
but
bitter
and
deep
were
the
evil
words
which
the
father
bestowed
on
the
son
and
as
owen
stood
proudly
and
sullenly
silent
disdaining
all
exculpation
of
himself
in
the
presence
of
one
who
had
wrought
him
so
much
graverâ€”so
fatal
an
injuryâ€”robertâ€™s
mother
entered
the
room
at
sight
of
her
natural
emotion
the
wrath
of
the
squire
was
redoubled
and
his
wild
suspicions
that
this
violence
of
owenâ€™s
to
robert
was
a
premeditated
act
appeared
like
the
proven
truth
through
the
mists
of
rage
he
summoned
domestics
as
if
to
guard
his
own
and
his
wifeâ€™s
life
from
the
attempts
of
his
son
and
the
servants
stood
wondering
aroundâ€”now
gazing
at
mrs
griffiths
alternately
scolding
and
sobbing
while
she
tried
to
restore
the
lad
from
his
really
bruised
and
half-unconscious
state
now
at
the
fierce
and
angry
squire
and
now
at
the
sad
and
silent
owen
and
heâ€”he
was
hardly
aware
of
their
looks
of
wonder
and
terror
his
fatherâ€™s
words
fell
on
a
deadened
ear
for
before
his
eyes
there
rose
a
pale
dead
babe
and
in
that
ladyâ€™s
violent
sounds
of
grief
he
heard
the
wailing
of
a
more
sad
more
hopeless
mother
for
by
this
time
the
lad
robert
had
opened
his
eyes
and
though
evidently
suffering
a
good
deal
from
the
effects
of
owenâ€™s
blows
was
fully
conscious
of
all
that
was
passing
around
him
had
owen
been
left
to
his
own
nature
his
heart
would
have
worked
itself
to
doubly
love
the
boy
whom
he
had
injured
but
he
was
stubborn
from
injustice
and
hardened
by
suffering
he
refused
to
vindicate
himself
he
made
no
effort
to
resist
the
imprisonment
the
squire
had
decreed
until
a
surgeonâ€™s
opinion
of
the
real
extent
of
robertâ€™s
injuries
was
made
known
it
was
not
until
the
door
was
locked
and
barred
as
if
upon
some
wild
and
furious
beast
that
the
recollection
of
poor
nest
without
his
comforting
presence
came
into
his
mind
oh
thought
he
how
she
would
be
wearying
pining
for
his
tender
sympathy
if
indeed
she
had
recovered
the
shock
of
mind
sufficiently
to
be
sensible
of
consolation
what
would
she
think
of
his
absence
could
she
imagine
he
believed
his
fatherâ€™s
words
and
had
left
her
in
this
her
sore
trouble
and
bereavement
the
thought
madened
him
and
he
looked
around
for
some
mode
of
escape
he
had
been
confined
in
a
small
unfurnished
room
on
the
first
floor
wainscoted
and
carved
all
round
with
a
massy
door
calculated
to
resist
the
attempts
of
a
dozen
strong
men
even
had
he
afterward
been
able
to
escape
from
the
house
unseen
unheard
the
window
was
placed
as
is
common
in
old
welsh
houses
over
the
fire-place
with
branching
chimneys
on
either
hand
forming
a
sort
of
projection
on
the
outside
by
this
outlet
his
escape
was
easy
even
had
he
been
less
determined
and
desperate
than
he
was
and
when
he
had
descended
with
a
little
care
a
little
winding
he
might
elude
all
observation
and
pursue
his
original
intention
of
going
to
ty
glas
the
storm
had
abated
and
watery
sunbeams
were
gilding
the
bay
as
owen
descended
from
the
window
and
stealing
along
in
the
broad
afternoon
shadows
made
his
way
to
the
little
plateau
of
green
turf
in
the
garden
at
the
top
of
a
steep
precipitous
rock
down
the
abrupt
face
of
which
he
had
often
dropped
by
means
of
a
well-secured
rope
into
the
small
sailing-boat
his
fatherâ€™s
present
alas
in
days
gone
by
which
lay
moored
in
the
deep
sea-water
below
he
had
always
kept
his
boat
there
because
it
was
the
nearest
available
spot
to
the
house
but
before
he
could
reach
the
placeâ€”unless
indeed
he
crossed
a
broad
sun-lighted
piece
of
ground
in
full
view
of
the
windows
on
that
side
of
the
house
and
without
the
shadow
of
a
single
sheltering
tree
or
shrubâ€”he
had
to
skirt
round
a
rude
semicircle
of
underwood
which
would
have
been
considered
as
a
shrubbery
had
any
one
taken
pains
with
it
step
by
step
he
stealthily
moved
alongâ€”hearing
voices
now
again
seeing
his
father
and
stepmother
in
no
distant
walk
the
squire
evidently
caressing
and
consoling
his
wife
who
seemed
to
be
urging
some
point
with
great
vehemence
again
forced
to
crouch
down
to
avoid
being
seen
by
the
cook
returning
from
the
rude
kitchen-garden
with
a
handful
of
herbs
this
was
the
way
the
doomed
heir
of
bodowen
left
his
ancestral
house
for
ever
and
hoped
to
leave
behind
him
his
doom
at
length
he
reached
the
plateauâ€”he
breathed
more
freely
he
stooped
to
discover
the
hidden
coil
of
rope
kept
safe
and
dry
in
a
hole
under
a
great
round
flat
piece
of
rock
his
head
was
bent
down
he
did
not
see
his
father
approach
nor
did
he
hear
his
footstep
for
the
rush
of
blood
to
his
head
in
the
stooping
effort
of
lifting
the
stone
the
squire
had
grappled
with
him
before
he
rose
up
again
before
he
fully
knew
whose
hands
detained
him
now
when
his
liberty
of
person
and
action
seemed
secure
he
made
a
vigorous
struggle
to
free
himself
he
wrestled
with
his
father
for
a
momentâ€”he
pushed
him
hard
and
drove
him
on
to
the
great
displaced
stone
all
unsteady
in
its
balance
down
went
the
squire
down
into
the
deep
waters
belowâ€”down
after
him
went
owen
half
consciously
half
unconsciously
partly
compelled
by
the
sudden
cessation
of
any
opposing
body
partly
from
a
vehement
irrepressible
impulse
to
rescue
his
father
but
he
had
instinctively
chosen
a
safer
place
in
the
deep
seawater
pool
than
that
into
which
his
push
had
sent
his
father
the
squire
had
hit
his
head
with
much
violence
against
the
side
of
the
boat
in
his
fall
it
is
indeed
doubtful
whether
he
was
not
killed
before
ever
he
sank
into
the
sea
but
owen
knew
nothing
save
that
the
awful
doom
seemed
even
now
present
he
plunged
down
he
dived
below
the
water
in
search
of
the
body
which
had
none
of
the
elasticity
of
life
to
buoy
it
up
he
saw
his
father
in
those
depths
he
clutched
at
him
he
brought
him
up
and
cast
him
a
dead
weight
into
the
boat
and
exhausted
by
the
effort
he
had
begun
himself
to
sink
again
before
he
instinctively
strove
to
rise
and
climb
into
the
rocking
boat
there
lay
his
father
with
a
deep
dent
in
the
side
of
his
head
where
the
skull
had
been
fractured
by
his
fall
his
face
blackened
by
the
arrested
course
of
the
blood
owen
felt
his
pulse
his
heartâ€”all
was
still
he
called
him
by
his
name
â€œfather
fatherâ€
he
cried
â€œcome
back
come
back
you
never
knew
how
i
loved
you
how
i
could
love
you
stillâ€”ifâ€”oh
godâ€
and
the
thought
of
his
little
child
rose
before
him
â€œyes
fatherâ€
he
cried
afresh
â€œyou
never
knew
how
he
fellâ€”how
he
died
oh
if
i
had
but
had
patience
to
tell
you
if
you
would
but
have
borne
with
me
and
listened
and
now
it
is
over
oh
father
fatherâ€
whether
she
had
heard
this
wild
wailing
voice
or
whether
it
was
only
that
she
missed
her
husband
and
wanted
him
for
some
little
every-day
question
or
as
was
perhaps
more
likely
she
had
discovered
owenâ€™s
escape
and
come
to
inform
her
husband
of
it
i
do
not
know
but
on
the
rock
right
above
his
head
as
it
seemed
owen
heard
his
stepmother
calling
her
husband
he
was
silent
and
softly
pushed
the
boat
right
under
the
rock
till
the
sides
grated
against
the
stones
and
the
overhanging
branches
concealed
him
and
it
from
all
not
on
a
level
with
the
water
wet
as
he
was
he
lay
down
by
his
dead
father
the
better
to
conceal
himself
and
somehow
the
action
recalled
those
early
days
of
childhoodâ€”the
first
in
the
squireâ€™s
widowhoodâ€”when
owen
had
shared
his
fatherâ€™s
bed
and
used
to
waken
him
in
the
morning
to
hear
one
of
the
old
welsh
legends
how
long
he
lay
thusâ€”body
chilled
and
brain
hard-working
through
the
heavy
pressure
of
a
reality
as
terrible
as
a
nightmareâ€”he
never
knew
but
at
length
he
roused
himself
up
to
think
of
nest
drawing
out
a
great
sail
he
covered
up
the
body
of
his
father
with
it
where
he
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
then
with
his
numbed
hands
he
took
the
oars
and
pulled
out
into
the
more
open
sea
toward
criccaeth
he
skirted
along
the
coast
till
he
found
a
shadowed
cleft
in
the
dark
rocks
to
that
point
he
rowed
and
anchored
his
boat
close
in
land
then
he
mounted
staggering
half
longing
to
fall
into
the
dark
waters
and
be
at
restâ€”half
instinctively
finding
out
the
surest
foot-rests
on
that
precipitous
face
of
rock
till
he
was
high
up
safe
landed
on
the
turfy
summit
he
ran
off
as
if
pursued
toward
penmorfa
he
ran
with
maddened
energy
suddenly
he
paused
turned
ran
again
with
the
same
speed
and
threw
himself
prone
on
the
summit
looking
down
into
his
boat
with
straining
eyes
to
see
if
there
had
been
any
movement
of
lifeâ€”any
displacement
of
a
fold
of
sail-cloth
it
was
all
quiet
deep
down
below
but
as
he
gazed
the
shifting
light
gave
the
appearance
of
a
slight
movement
owen
ran
to
a
lower
part
of
the
rock
stripped
plunged
into
the
water
and
swam
to
the
boat
when
there
all
was
stillâ€”awfully
still
for
a
minute
or
two
he
dared
not
lift
up
the
cloth
then
reflecting
that
the
same
terror
might
beset
him
againâ€”of
leaving
his
father
unaided
while
yet
a
spark
of
life
lingeredâ€”he
removed
the
shrouding
cover
the
eyes
looked
into
his
with
a
dead
stare
he
closed
the
lids
and
bound
up
the
jaw
again
he
looked
this
time
he
raised
himself
out
of
the
water
and
kissed
the
brow
â€œit
was
my
doom
father
it
would
have
been
better
if
i
had
died
at
my
birthâ€
daylight
was
fading
away
precious
daylight
he
swam
back
dressed
and
set
off
afresh
for
penmorfa
when
he
opened
the
door
of
ty
glas
ellis
pritchard
looked
at
him
reproachfully
from
his
seat
in
the
darkly-shadowed
chimney-corner
â€œyouâ€™re
come
at
lastâ€
said
he
â€œone
of
our
kind
ie
station
would
not
have
left
his
wife
to
mourn
by
herself
over
her
dead
child
nor
would
one
of
our
kind
have
let
his
father
kill
his
own
true
son
iâ€™ve
a
good
mind
to
take
her
from
you
for
everâ€
â€œi
did
not
tell
himâ€
cried
nest
looking
piteously
at
her
husband
â€œhe
made
me
tell
him
part
and
guessed
the
restâ€
she
was
nursing
her
babe
on
her
knee
as
if
it
was
alive
owen
stood
before
ellis
pritchard
â€œbe
silentâ€
said
he
quietly
â€œneither
words
nor
deeds
but
what
are
decreed
can
come
to
pass
i
was
set
to
do
my
work
this
hundred
years
and
more
the
time
waited
for
me
and
the
man
waited
for
me
i
have
done
what
was
foretold
of
me
for
generationsâ€
ellis
pritchard
knew
the
old
tale
of
the
prophecy
and
believed
in
it
in
a
dull
dead
kind
of
way
but
somehow
never
thought
it
would
come
to
pass
in
his
time
now
however
he
understood
it
all
in
a
moment
though
he
mistook
owenâ€™s
nature
so
much
as
to
believe
that
the
deed
was
intentionally
done
out
of
revenge
for
the
death
of
his
boy
and
viewing
it
in
this
light
ellis
thought
it
little
more
than
a
just
punishment
for
the
cause
of
all
the
wild
despairing
sorrow
he
had
seen
his
only
child
suffer
during
the
hours
of
this
long
afternoon
but
he
knew
the
law
would
not
so
regard
it
even
the
lax
welsh
law
of
those
days
could
not
fail
to
examine
into
the
death
of
a
man
of
squire
griffithâ€™s
standing
so
the
acute
ellis
thought
how
he
could
conceal
the
culprit
for
a
time
â€œcomeâ€
said
he
â€œdonâ€™t
look
so
scared
it
was
your
doom
not
your
faultâ€
and
he
laid
a
hand
on
owenâ€™s
shoulder
â€œyouâ€™re
wetâ€
said
he
suddenly
â€œwhere
have
you
been
nest
your
husband
is
dripping
drookit
wet
thatâ€™s
what
makes
him
look
so
blue
and
wanâ€
nest
softly
laid
her
baby
in
its
cradle
she
was
half
stupefied
with
crying
and
had
not
understood
to
what
owen
alluded
when
he
spoke
of
his
doom
being
fulfilled
if
indeed
she
had
heard
the
words
her
touch
thawed
owenâ€™s
miserable
heart
â€œoh
nestâ€
said
he
clasping
her
in
his
arms
â€œdo
you
love
me
stillâ€”can
you
love
me
my
own
darlingâ€
â€œwhy
notâ€
asked
she
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
â€œi
only
love
you
more
than
ever
for
you
were
my
poor
babyâ€™s
fatherâ€
â€œbut
nestâ€”oh
tell
her
ellis
you
knowâ€
â€œno
need
no
needâ€
said
ellis
â€œsheâ€™s
had
enough
to
think
on
bustle
my
girl
and
get
out
my
sunday
clothesâ€
â€œi
donâ€™t
understandâ€
said
nest
putting
her
hand
up
to
her
head
â€œwhat
is
to
tell
and
why
are
you
so
wet
god
help
me
for
a
poor
crazed
thing
for
i
cannot
guess
at
the
meaning
of
your
words
and
your
strange
looks
i
only
know
my
baby
is
deadâ€
and
she
burst
into
tears
â€œcome
nest
go
and
fetch
him
a
change
quickâ€
and
as
she
meekly
obeyed
too
languid
to
strive
further
to
understand
ellis
said
rapidly
to
owen
in
a
low
hurried
voiceâ€”
â€œare
you
meaning
that
the
squire
is
dead
speak
low
lest
she
hear
well
well
no
need
to
talk
about
how
he
died
it
was
sudden
i
see
and
we
must
all
of
us
die
and
heâ€™ll
have
to
be
buried
itâ€™s
well
the
night
is
near
and
i
should
not
wonder
now
if
youâ€™d
like
to
travel
for
a
bit
it
would
do
nest
a
power
of
good
and
thenâ€”thereâ€™s
many
a
one
goes
out
of
his
own
house
and
never
comes
back
again
andâ€”i
trust
heâ€™s
not
lying
in
his
own
houseâ€”and
thereâ€™s
a
stir
for
a
bit
and
a
search
and
a
wonderâ€”and
by-and-by
the
heir
just
steps
in
as
quiet
as
can
be
and
thatâ€™s
what
youâ€™ll
do
and
bring
nest
to
bodowen
after
all
nay
child
better
stockings
nor
those
find
the
blue
woollens
i
bought
at
llanrwst
fair
only
donâ€™t
lose
heart
itâ€™s
done
now
and
canâ€™t
be
helped
it
was
the
piece
of
work
set
you
to
do
from
the
days
of
the
tudors
they
say
and
he
deserved
it
look
in
yon
cradle
so
tell
us
where
he
is
and
iâ€™ll
take
heart
of
grace
and
see
what
can
be
done
for
himâ€
but
owen
sat
wet
and
haggard
looking
into
the
peat
fire
as
if
for
visions
of
the
past
and
never
heeding
a
word
ellis
said
nor
did
he
move
when
nest
brought
the
armful
of
dry
clothes
â€œcome
rouse
up
manâ€
said
ellis
growing
impatient
but
he
neither
spoke
nor
moved
â€œwhat
is
the
matter
fatherâ€
asked
nest
bewildered
ellis
kept
on
watching
owen
for
a
minute
or
two
till
on
his
daughterâ€™s
repetition
of
the
question
he
saidâ€”
â€œask
him
yourself
nestâ€
â€œoh
husband
what
is
itâ€
said
she
kneeling
down
and
bringing
her
face
to
a
level
with
his
â€œdonâ€™t
you
knowâ€
said
he
heavily
â€œyou
wonâ€™t
love
me
when
you
do
know
and
yet
it
was
not
my
doing
it
was
my
doomâ€
â€œwhat
does
he
mean
fatherâ€
asked
nest
looking
up
but
she
caught
a
gesture
from
ellis
urging
her
to
go
on
questioning
her
husband
â€œi
will
love
you
husband
whatever
has
happened
only
let
me
know
the
worstâ€
a
pause
during
which
nest
and
ellis
hung
breathless
â€œmy
father
is
dead
nestâ€
nest
caught
her
breath
with
a
sharp
gasp
â€œgod
forgive
himâ€
said
she
thinking
on
her
babe
â€œgod
forgive
meâ€
said
owen
â€œyou
did
notâ€”â€
nest
stopped
â€œyes
i
did
now
you
know
it
it
was
my
doom
how
could
i
help
it
the
devil
helped
meâ€”he
placed
the
stone
so
that
my
father
fell
i
jumped
into
the
water
to
save
him
i
did
indeed
nest
i
was
nearly
drowned
myself
but
he
was
deadâ€”deadâ€”killed
by
the
fallâ€
â€œthen
he
is
safe
at
the
bottom
of
the
seaâ€
said
ellis
with
hungry
eagerness
â€œno
he
is
not
he
lies
in
my
boatâ€
said
owen
shivering
a
little
more
at
the
thought
of
his
last
glimpse
at
his
fatherâ€™s
face
than
from
cold
â€œoh
husband
change
your
wet
clothesâ€
pleaded
nest
to
whom
the
death
of
the
old
man
was
simply
a
horror
with
which
she
had
nothing
to
do
while
her
husbandâ€™s
discomfort
was
a
present
trouble
while
she
helped
him
to
take
off
the
wet
garments
which
he
would
never
have
had
energy
enough
to
remove
of
himself
ellis
was
busy
preparing
food
and
mixing
a
great
tumbler
of
spirits
and
hot
water
he
stood
over
the
unfortunate
young
man
and
compelled
him
to
eat
and
drink
and
made
nest
too
taste
some
mouthfulsâ€”all
the
while
planning
in
his
own
mind
how
best
to
conceal
what
had
been
done
and
who
had
done
it
not
altogether
without
a
certain
feeling
of
vulgar
triumph
in
the
reflection
that
nest
as
she
stood
there
carelessly
dressed
dishevelled
in
her
grief
was
in
reality
the
mistress
of
bodowen
than
which
ellis
pritchard
had
never
seen
a
grander
house
though
he
believed
such
might
exist
by
dint
of
a
few
dexterous
questions
he
found
out
all
he
wanted
to
know
from
owen
as
he
ate
and
drank
in
fact
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
owen
to
dilute
the
horror
by
talking
about
it
before
the
meal
was
done
if
meal
it
could
be
called
ellis
knew
all
he
cared
to
know
â€œnow
nest
on
with
your
cloak
and
haps
pack
up
what
needs
to
go
with
you
for
both
you
and
your
husband
must
be
half
way
to
liverpool
by
to-morrowâ€™s
morn
iâ€™ll
take
you
past
rhyl
sands
in
my
fishing-boat
with
yours
in
tow
and
once
over
the
dangerous
part
iâ€™ll
return
with
my
cargo
of
fish
and
learn
how
much
stir
there
is
at
bodowen
once
safe
hidden
in
liverpool
no
one
will
know
where
you
are
and
you
may
stay
quiet
till
your
time
comes
for
returningâ€
â€œi
will
never
come
home
againâ€
said
owen
doggedly
â€œthe
place
is
accursedâ€
â€œhoot
be
guided
by
me
man
why
it
was
but
an
accident
after
all
and
weâ€™ll
land
at
the
holy
island
at
the
point
of
llyn
there
is
an
old
cousin
of
mine
the
parson
thereâ€”for
the
pritchards
have
known
better
days
squireâ€”and
weâ€™ll
bury
him
there
it
was
but
an
accident
man
hold
up
your
head
you
and
nest
will
come
home
yet
and
fill
bodowen
with
children
and
iâ€™ll
live
to
see
itâ€
â€œneverâ€
said
owen
â€œi
am
the
last
male
of
my
race
and
the
son
has
murdered
his
fatherâ€
nest
came
in
laden
and
cloaked
ellis
was
for
hurrying
them
off
the
fire
was
extinguished
the
door
was
locked
â€œhere
nest
my
darling
let
me
take
your
bundle
while
i
guide
you
down
the
stepsâ€
but
her
husband
bent
his
head
and
spoke
never
a
word
nest
gave
her
father
the
bundle
already
loaded
with
such
things
as
he
himself
had
seen
fit
to
take
but
clasped
another
softly
and
tightly
â€œno
one
shall
help
me
with
thisâ€
said
she
in
a
low
voice
her
father
did
not
understand
her
her
husband
did
and
placed
his
strong
helping
arm
round
her
waist
and
blessed
her
â€œwe
will
all
go
together
nestâ€
said
he
â€œbut
whereâ€
and
he
looked
up
at
the
storm-tossed
clouds
coming
up
from
windward
â€œit
is
a
dirty
nightâ€
said
ellis
turning
his
head
round
to
speak
to
his
companions
at
last
â€œbut
never
fear
weâ€™ll
weather
itâ€
and
he
made
for
the
place
where
his
vessel
was
moored
then
he
stopped
and
thought
a
moment
â€œstay
hereâ€
said
he
addressing
his
companions
â€œi
may
meet
folk
and
i
shall
maybe
have
to
hear
and
to
speak
you
wait
here
till
i
come
back
for
youâ€
so
they
sat
down
close
together
in
a
corner
of
the
path
â€œlet
me
look
at
him
nestâ€
said
owen
she
took
her
little
dead
son
out
from
under
her
shawl
they
looked
at
his
waxen
face
long
and
tenderly
kissed
it
and
covered
it
up
reverently
and
softly
â€œnestâ€
said
owen
at
last
â€œi
feel
as
though
my
fatherâ€™s
spirit
had
been
near
us
and
as
if
it
had
bent
over
our
poor
little
one
a
strange
chilly
air
met
me
as
i
stooped
over
him
i
could
fancy
the
spirit
of
our
pure
blameless
child
guiding
my
fatherâ€™s
safe
over
the
paths
of
the
sky
to
the
gates
of
heaven
and
escaping
those
accursed
dogs
of
hell
that
were
darting
up
from
the
north
in
pursuit
of
souls
not
five
minutes
since
â€œdonâ€™t
talk
so
owenâ€
said
nest
curling
up
to
him
in
the
darkness
of
the
copse
â€œwho
knows
what
may
be
listeningâ€
the
pair
were
silent
in
a
kind
of
nameless
terror
till
they
heard
ellis
pritchardâ€™s
loud
whisper
â€œwhere
are
ye
come
along
soft
and
steady
there
were
folk
about
even
now
and
the
squire
is
missed
and
madam
in
a
frightâ€
they
went
swiftly
down
to
the
little
harbour
and
embarked
on
board
ellisâ€™s
boat
the
sea
heaved
and
rocked
even
there
the
torn
clouds
went
hurrying
overhead
in
a
wild
tumultuous
manner
they
put
out
into
the
bay
still
in
silence
except
when
some
word
of
command
was
spoken
by
ellis
who
took
the
management
of
the
vessel
they
made
for
the
rocky
shore
where
owenâ€™s
boat
had
been
moored
it
was
not
there
it
had
broken
loose
and
disappeared
owen
sat
down
and
covered
his
face
this
last
event
so
simple
and
natural
in
itself
struck
on
his
excited
and
superstitious
mind
in
an
extraordinary
manner
he
had
hoped
for
a
certain
reconciliation
so
to
say
by
laying
his
father
and
his
child
both
in
one
grave
but
now
it
appeared
to
him
as
if
there
was
to
be
no
forgiveness
as
if
his
father
revolted
even
in
death
against
any
such
peaceful
union
ellis
took
a
practical
view
of
the
case
if
the
squireâ€™s
body
was
found
drifting
about
in
a
boat
known
to
belong
to
his
son
it
would
create
terrible
suspicion
as
to
the
manner
of
his
death
at
one
time
in
the
evening
ellis
had
thought
of
persuading
owen
to
let
him
bury
the
squire
in
a
sailorâ€™s
grave
or
in
other
words
to
sew
him
up
in
a
spare
sail
and
weighting
it
well
sink
it
for
ever
he
had
not
broached
the
subject
from
a
certain
fear
of
owenâ€™s
passionate
repugnance
to
the
plan
otherwise
if
he
had
consented
they
might
have
returned
to
penmorfa
and
passively
awaited
the
course
of
events
secure
of
owenâ€™s
succession
to
bodowen
sooner
or
later
or
if
owen
was
too
much
overwhelmed
by
what
had
happened
ellis
would
have
advised
him
to
go
away
for
a
short
time
and
return
when
the
buzz
and
the
talk
was
over
now
it
was
different
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
they
should
leave
the
country
for
a
time
through
those
stormy
waters
they
must
plough
their
way
that
very
night
ellis
had
no
fearâ€”would
have
had
no
fear
at
any
rate
with
owen
as
he
had
been
a
week
a
day
ago
but
with
owen
wild
despairing
helpless
fate-pursued
what
could
he
do
they
sailed
into
the
tossing
darkness
and
were
never
more
seen
of
men
the
house
of
bodowen
has
sunk

dark
