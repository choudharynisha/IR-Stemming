i
was
hard
at
work
in
my
tent
i
had
almost
completed
translating
the
inscription
of
a
small
stele
of
amen-hotep
iii
dated
b
c
1382
which
with
my
own
efforts
i
had
discovered
and
i
was
feeling
wonderfully
self-satisfied
in
consequence
when
of
a
sudden
i
heard
a
great
commotion
without
almost
immediately
the
tent
flap
was
lifted
and
migdal
abu's
black
face
appeared
he
looked
vastly
excited
for
an
arab
and
he
rolled
his
eyes
horribly
what
do
you
want
i
demanded
irritably
did
i
not
tell
you
i
was
not
to
be
disturbed
he
bent
almost
double
excellency--a
white
sheik
has
come
riding
on
an
ass
and
with
him
a
shameless
female
also
white
the
dickens
i
exclaimed
for
i
had
not
seen
a
european
for
nine
weeks
migdal
abu
advanced
with
hand
outstretched
excellency
he
would
have
me
give
you
this
i
took
this
and
swore
softly
underbreath
at
the
humourless
pomposity
of
my
unknown
countryman
it
was
a
pasteboard
carte-de-visite
and
we--in
the
heart
of
the
libyan
desert
with
a
laugh
i
looked
at
the
thing
and
read
his
name--sir
robert
ottley
what
i
said
then
sprang
a-foot
ottley
the
great
egyptologist
ottley
the
famous
explorer
ottley
the
eminent
decipherer
of
cuneiform
inscriptions
ottley
the
millionaire
whose
prodigality
in
the
cause
of
learning
had
in
ten
short
years
more
than
doubled
the
common
stock
of
knowledge
of
the
history
of
the
shepherd
kings
of
the
nile
i
had
been
longing
since
a
lad
to
meet
him
and
now
he
had
come
unasked
to
see
me
out
on
the
burning
sands
of
yatibiri
trembling
with
excitement
i
caught
up
a
jacket
and
hardly
waiting
to
thrust
my
arms
into
the
sleeves
rushed
out
of
the
tent
before
me
sitting
on
an
ass
that
was
already
sound
asleep
despite
a
plague
of
flies
that
played
about
its
eyes
was
a
little
bronze-faced
grizzled
old
man
attired
from
head
to
foot
in
glistening
white
duck
and
wearing
on
his
head
an
enormous
pith
helmet
my
arabs
glad
of
an
excuse
to
cease
work
squatted
round
him
in
a
semi-circle
sir
robert
ottley
i
cried
a
thousand
welcomes
you
are
very
good
he
drawled
i
presume
you
are
dr
pinsent
at
your
service
he
stooped
a
little
forward
and
offered
me
his
hand
will
you
not
dismount
i
asked
thank
you
no
i
have
come
to
ask
a
favour
then
he
glanced
round
him
and
began
deliberately
to
count
my
arabs
i
surveyed
him
in
blank
astonishment
he
possessed
a
large
hawk-like
nose
a
small
thin-lipped
mouth
and
little
eyes
twinkling
under
brows
that
beetled
twelve
and
two
of
them
are
good
for
nothing
mere
weeds
said
sir
robert
then
he
turned
to
me
with
a
smile
you
will
forgive
me
he
asked
adding
quickly
but
then
arabs
are
cattle
there
was
no
personal
reflection
a
cup
of
coffee
i
suggested
the
sun
is
dreadful
it
would
refresh
you
the
sun
is
nothing
he
replied
and
i
have
work
to
do
i
am
camped
on
the
southern
slope
of
the
hill
of
rakh
it
is
twelve
miles
i
have
found
the
tomb
for
which
i
have
been
searching
seven
years
i
thought
i
had
enough
arabs
i
was
mistaken
you
may
have
the
use
of
mine
and
welcome
i
observed
he
gave
a
queer
little
bow
he
gives
twice
who
gives
quickly
the
sarcophagus
is
in
a
rock
hole
forty
feet
beneath
the
level
of
the
desert
i
simply
must
have
it
up
to-night
they
shall
start
at
once
and
i
shall
go
with
them
i
am
as
strong
as
six
i
replied
then
i
shouted
some
orders
to
migdal
abu
when
i
turned
it
was
to
gasp
a
woman
had
materialised
from
the
sunbeams
i
had
completely
forgotten
that
sir
robert
had
a
female
companion
all
my
eyes
had
been
for
him
i
swung
off
my
hat
and
stammered
some
tardy
words
of
welcome
and
invitation
sir
robert
interrupted
me
my
daughter--dr
pinsent
he
drawled
in
slow
passionless
tones
my
daughter
does
not
require
any
refreshment
thank
you
doctor
i
am
too
excited
said
a
singularly
sweet
voice
father's
discovery
has
put
me
into
a
fever
i
really
could
not
eat
and
coffee
would
choke
me
but
if
you
could
give
me
a
little
water
i
rushed
into
my
tent
and
returned
with
a
brimming
metal
cup
the
arabs
have
broken
all
my
glass
ware
i
said
apologetically
she
lifted
her
veil
and
our
eyes
met
she
was
lovely
she
smiled
and
showed
a
set
of
dazzling
teeth
the
incisors
were
inlaid
with
gold
i
remarked
the
fact
in
a
sort
of
self-defensive
panic
for
the
truth
is
i
am
a
shy
idiot
with
pretty
women
thank
goodness
she
was
thirsty
and
did
not
notice
my
confusion
two
minutes
afterwards
i
was
mounted
on
my
donkey
and
we
were
off
on
the
long
tramp
to
the
hill
of
rakh
the
arabs
trailing
behind
us
in
a
thin
ill-humoured
line
we
maintained
the
silence
of
bad
temper
and
excessive
heat
until
the
sun
sank
into
the
sand
then
however
we
wiped
our
foreheads
said
a
cheerful
good-bye
to
the
flies
that
had
been
tormenting
us
and
woke
up
i
am
immensely
obliged
to
you
dr
pinsent
said
sir
robert
so
am
i
said
miss
ottley
the
boot
is
on
the
other
foot
i
replied
it's
kind
of
you
to
permit
me
to
be
present
at
your
triumph
is
it
a
king
no
said
miss
ottley
a
priest
of
amen
of
the
eighteenth
dynasty
oh
a
priest
miss
ottley
bridled
at
my
tone
no
king
was
ever
half
as
interesting
as
our
priest
she
declared
he
was
a
wonderful
man
in
every
way
a
prophet
a
magician
and
enormously
powerful
besides
he
is
believed
to
have
committed
suicide
for
the
sake
of
principle
and
he
predicted
his
own
resurrection
after
a
sleep
of
two
thousand
years
he
has
been
dead
3285
years
sighed
sir
robert
is
that
his
fault
cried
the
girl
it
falsifies
his
prophecy
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
ptahmes
was
his
name
said
sir
robert
turning
to
me
he
was
the
right-hand
man
of
amen-hotep
iv
but
when
that
king
changed
his
religion
and
his
name
and
became
akhenaten
and
a
devotee
of
the
old
worship
of
heliopolis
ptahmes
apparently
killed
himself
as
a
protest
against
the
deposition
of
amen
his
particular
divinity
read
that
said
miss
ottley
she
handed
me
a
page
of
type-written
manuscript
it
ran
as
follows
hearken
to
the
orders
which
are
put
upon
you
by
ptahmes
named
tahutimes
son
of
mery
son
of
hap
all
my
ways
were
regulated
even
as
the
pace
of
an
ibis
the
hawk-headed
horus
was
my
protector
like
amulets
upon
my
body
i
trained
the
troops
of
my
lord
i
made
his
pylon
60
cubits
long
in
the
noble
rock
of
quartzite
most
great
in
height
and
firm
as
heaven
i
did
not
imitate
what
had
been
done
before
i
was
the
royal
scribe
of
the
recruits
mustering
was
done
under
me
i
was
appointed
judge
of
the
palace
overseer
of
all
the
prophets
of
the
south
and
of
the
north
i
was
appointed
high
priest
of
amen
in
the
capital--king
of
all
the
gods
i
was
made
the
eyes
and
ears
of
the
king
keeper
of
my
lord's
heart
and
fan-bearer
at
the
king's
right
hand
great
men
have
come
from
afar
to
bow
themselves
before
me
bringing
presents
of
ivory
and
gold
copper
silver
and
emery
lazuli
malachite
green
felspar
and
vases
of
mern
wood
inlaid
with
white
precious
stones
sometimes
bearing
gold
at
one
time
1000
deben
200
pounds
weight
for
my
fame
was
carried
abroad
even
as
the
fame
of
the
king
'lord
of
the
sweet
wind'
and
there
was
spoken
of
me
by
the
son
of
paapis
that
my
wisdom
was
of
a
divine
nature
because
of
my
knowledge
of
futurities
yet
on
the
sixth
day
of
the
month
of
pakhons
in
the
18th
year
i
desire
to
rest
my
lord
at
the
solicitation
of
the
great
royal
wife
and
mother
nefertiti
has
put
off
the
worship
of
his
predecessors
the
name
of
amen
is
proscribed
from
the
country
ra
is
proscribed
from
the
country
horus
is
proscribed
from
the
country
aten
is
set
up
in
their
place
and
worshipped
in
the
land
my
lord
has
even
changed
his
name
apiy
is
the
high
priest
of
the
new
god
that
is
from
the
mesopotamian
wilderness
amen
king
of
the
gods
dandled
my
lord
and
is
forsaken
and
proscribed
i
am
an
old
man
and
would
rest
although
my
lord
has
not
forsaken
me
he
has
appointed
me
overseer
of
all
his
works
therefore
shall
you
carry
me
to
the
temple
of
kak
and
give
my
body
to
the
hands
of
the
priests
of
amen
who
will
wrap
me
in
the
linen
sheets
of
horus
without
removing
my
heart
my
entrails
or
my
lungs
then
you
shall
carry
me
to
khizebh
and
enclose
me
in
the
place
prepared
for
me
and
cover
my
tomb
to
a
depth
of
five
fathoms
with
the
sand
of
the
desert
at
that
hour
when
no
man
looks
or
listens
do
this
even
as
i
command
and
as
royal
scribe
i
trace
the
order
with
my
pen
but
you
shall
place
my
papyri
and
the
sign
by
which
i
shall
be
known
and
the
stele
of
ivory
engraved
with
the
directions
to
the
priests
of
amen
who
are
to
wake
me
from
my
sleep
at
the
distant
hour
in
the
tomb
that
is
prepared
for
my
body
in
the
temple
of
merenptah
and
in
such
manner
that
i
shall
there
appear
to
sleep
and
all
these
things
you
shall
do
or
my
curse
shall
pursue
you
and
your
children
and
their
children
for
the
space
of
four
hundred
lives
nor
shall
you
remove
the
endowment
of
my
gifts
nor
touch
them
where
they
lie
under
a
penalty
of
great
moment
i
strained
my
eyes
to
catch
the
last
words
for
the
darkness
was
already
setting
down
upon
the
desert
and
i
was
profoundly
interested
wonderful
i
said
as
i
returned
her
the
document
a
papyrus
of
course
yes
one
of
several
father
found
it
seven
years
ago
at
dier
el
batiri
i
had
not
heard
sir
robert
coughed
no
said
he
nor
anyone
else
i
have
never
published
it
it
did
not
come
to
me
in
the
usual
way
i
bought
it
from
an
arab
who
had
rifled
the
tomb
in
which
it
was
discovered
and
the
other
papyri
and
the
ivory
stele
i
questioned
they
are
in
my
possession
too
they
enabled
you
doubtless
to
locate
the
real
tomb
that
holds
the
body
they
helped
then
silence
supervened
to
me
it
was
filled
with
wonder
i
could
not
help
asking
myself
what
circumstances
could
possibly
have
induced
ottley
to
withhold
so
valuable
an
historic
treasure
for
so
many
years
from
the
world
such
a
course
of
action
was
utterly
opposed
to
all
practice
and
the
unwritten
but
immutable
laws
of
scientific
research
it
seemed
strangely
at
odds
too
with
the
man's
reputed
character
it
would
have
covered
him
with
glory
to
have
placed
his
discovery
before
the
society
to
which
we
both
belonged
and
a
dozen
incidents
related
of
him
far
and
wide
proved
that
he
was
not
indifferent
to
praise
and
fame
he
read
my
thoughts
probably
for
at
length
he
cleared
his
throat
and
spoke
there
were
reasons
why
i
should
not
blazon
the
find
abroad
he
said
no
doubt
i
observed
with
unintentioned
dryness
one
papyrus
speaks
of
a
golden
treasure
he
went
on
quietly
if
published
it
would
have
set
thousands
looking
for
the
tomb
in
that
case
the
chances
are
that
the
body
of
ptahmes
would
have
been
destroyed
by
some
vandal
intent
solely
on
pillage
you
assumed
a
great
responsibility
i
remarked
i
simply
had
to
say
it
for
i
was
angry
and
his
explanation
appeared
puerile
to
me
do
you
dispute
my
right
he
demanded
coldly
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
sir
robert
doubtless
when
the
time
comes
you
will
be
able
to
satisfy
the
society
and
the
world
that
you
have
acted
rightly
i
admit
no
responsibility
he
answered
and
permit
me
to
observe
that
you
are
talking
nonsense
i
owe
no
duty
to
communicate
the
results
of
my
purchases
or
discoveries
to
any
society
or
to
the
world
true
sir
robert
an
action
for
damages
could
not
lie
against
you
sir
he
cried
father
said
miss
ottley
how
can
dr
pinsent's
foolish
sarcasm
affect
you
besides
we
need
his
arabs
quite
so
said
sir
robert
we
need
his
arabs
how
brightly
the
stars
shine
to-night
dr
pinsent
the
cool
impudence
of
the
pair
struck
me
dumb
i
shook
with
passion
for
a
moment
i
thought
of
calling
a
halt
and
returning
the
way
we
had
come
to
my
own
camp
with
my
arabs
but
for
my
curiosity
to
see
the
tomb
of
ptahmes
very
probably
i
should
have
done
so
in
a
few
seconds
however
my
rage
cooled
and
my
uppermost
feeling
was
admiration
mixed
with
mirth
i
had
never
been
treated
with
such
open
and
absurd
contempt
before
it
was
a
refreshing
experience
i
burst
of
a
sudden
into
a
peal
of
laughter
miss
ottley
joined
me
in
the
exercise
but
sir
robert
rode
on
like
a
hook-nosed
sphinx
i
knew
i
could
not
be
mistaken
said
miss
ottley
you
should
thank
god
for
your
sense
of
humour
dr
pinsent
and
who
is
benefiting
from
it
at
this
moment
i
should
like
to
know
i
retorted
the
thanks
are
due
from
you
i
fancy
deo
gratias
she
flashed
in
sober
truth
we
need
your
arabs
sadly
i
repeat
i
am
glad
to
be
of
use
we
shall
use
you
but
not
necessarily
in
the
cause
of
your
society
understand
that
fully
you
mean
that
you
must
not
expect
to
share
our
secrets
in
plain
words
you
will
not
let
me
help
you
open
the
sarcophagus
your
penetration
is
remarkable
and
if----
and
if
she
interrupted
quickly
you
require
a
reward
for
the
courtesy
we
asked
and
you
accorded
or
have
promised
to
accord
you
have
but
to
name
a
sum
in
cash
to
have
it
paid
or----
said
i
stung
to
the
quick
or
she
flashed
return
you
are
at
liberty
to
make
your
choice
yours
are
not
the
only
arabs
in
egypt
at
a
pinch
we
can
wait
a
day
or
two
it
is
for
you
to
say
i
tore
off
my
hat
miss
ottley--my
arabs
are
yours
for
as
long
as
you
require
them
i
furiously
announced
good
day
to
you
sir
robert
good
day
then
i
dragged
the
head
of
my
ass
round
and
set
his
face
to
my
camp
the
beast
however
would
hardly
budge
and
i
had
to
belabour
him
unmercifully
to
induce
him
to
trot
never
did
man
make
a
more
undignified
exit
from
circumstances
of
indignity
and
it
did
not
need
miss
ottley's
mocking
laughter
to
assure
me
that
i
looked
ridiculous
i
could
have
strangled
her
with
all
the
cheerfulness
in
life
and
from
that
moment
i
have
cherished
an
ineradicable
hatred
of
donkeys
sir
robert
did
not
open
his
lips
he
did
not
even
return
my
angry
salute
almost
choking
with
rage
i
finally
got
out
of
range
of
miss
ottley's
laughter
then
i
dismounted
and
told
the
desert
just
what
i
thought
of
her
and
her
father
it
was
almost
midnight
when
i
reached
my
camp
for
to
crown
all
i
neglected
the
stars
in
my
passion
and
for
two
hours
lost
my
way
chapter
ii
a
patient
of
the
desert
i
spent
the
next
two
days
in
absolute
solitude
and
got
through
a
tremendous
quantity
of
toil
in
fact
i
added
two
whole
chapters
to
my
treatise
on
the
nile
monuments
and
i
arranged
the
details
of
a
third
by
the
end
of
that
time
however
i
was
ravenously
hungry
i
had
been
too
engrossed
in
labour
to
think
of
eating
anything
but
biscuits
and
appetite
at
last
turned
me
out
of
the
tent
i
looked
around
for
my
arabs
and
saw
sand
and
sky--no
living
thing--oh
yes
there
was
my
donkey
the
little
beast
had
eaten
his
way
through
a
truss
of
straw
and
was
asleep
strolling
over
to
the
ruined
pylon
i
glanced
down
into
the
hole
my
arabs
had
excavated
it
was
empty
gad
i
exclaimed
they
must
still
be
working
for
ottley
i
had
to
build
a
fire
and
turn
cook
willy
nilly
later
fortified
with
the
pleasant
conviction
of
a
good
dinner
i
turned
my
telescope
on
the
hill
of
rakh
an
arab
stood
on
the
treeless
summit
leaning
on
a
rifle
whose
barrel
glittered
in
the
sunlight
i
was
puzzled
he
was
manifestly
posted
there
as
sentinel
but
why
i
watched
him
till
dark
but
he
did
not
move
that
night
i
shot
a
jackal--omen
of
disaster
it
was
long
before
i
slept
yet
i
seemed
only
to
have
slumbered
a
moment
or
two
when
i
awoke
a
voice
called
my
name
aloud
dr
pinsent
dr
pinsent
i
started
upright
and
listened
nerves
on
edge
dr
pinsent
who
calls
i
shouted
i--may
ottley
miss
ottley
i
hopped
out
of
my
bag
bed
like
a
cricket
just
a
moment
i
struck
a
light
and
grabbing
at
my
clothes
proceeded
to
dress
like
mad
thus
for
thirty
seconds
then
i
remembered
how
i
had
been
treated
and
went
slower
then
i
thought--pinsent
you're
a
cad--she's
a
woman
and
perhaps
in
trouble
so
i
got
up
steam
again
and
called
out
nothing
wrong
i
hope
yes
said
miss
ottley
well
here
was
a
woman
of
business
at
any
rate
she
seemed
to
know
the
use
of
words
and
valued
them
accordingly
waste
not
want
not
i
drew
on
my
jacket
and
lifted
the
flap
an
arab
rustled
past
me
hello
said
i
not
so
fast
my
man
but
it
was
miss
ottley
i
stepped
back
bewildered
her
hair
was
tucked
away
in
a
sort
of
turban
and
she
was
wrapped
from
head
to
heel
in
a
burnous
that
had
once
been
white--very
long
ago
but
the
costume
though
dirty
was
becoming
she
sank
upon
a
camp
stool
and
asked
at
once
for
water
she
seemed
very
tired
my
bag
was
empty
i
hurried
off
without
a
word
to
the
barrel
in
the
temple
when
i
returned
she
was
asleep
where
she
sat
i
touched
her
shoulder
and
she
started
up
suppressing
a
scream
now
said
i
as
she
put
down
the
cup
miss
ottley
stood
up
a
bad
thing
has
happened
she
began
the
sarcophagus
was
filled
with
treasure
gold
and
silver
in
bars
and
other
things
the
arabs
went
mad
my
father
fought
like
a
paladin
and
held
them
off
for
a
day
and
a
half
but
soon
after
dark
this
evening
a
caravan
arrived
the
fight
was
renewed
and
my
father
was
wounded
the
arabs
secured
the
treasure
and
fled
into
the
desert
the
dragoman
only
kept
faith
with
us
he
has
gone
by
the
river
to
khonsu
for
troops
i
hurried
here
for
you
i
ran
almost
all
the
way
will
you
come
father
is
very
ill
he
has
lost
a
lot
of
blood
he
was
shot
in
the
shoulder
i
nodded
caught
up
my
revolver
and
surgical
pack
and
rushed
out
of
the
tent
in
two
minutes
i
had
saddled
the
donkey
miss
ottley
was
standing
by
the
door
of
the
tent
i
lifted
her
on
the
beast
and
we
started
off
in
silence
an
hour
later
she
spoke
there
is
one
thing
i
like
about
you
she
announced
you
haven't
much
to
say
for
yourself
but
you
are
a
worker
tu
quoque
i
replied
you
must
have
done
that
twelve
miles
in
record
time
it
is
not
yet
two
o'clock
i
made
it
in
two
hours
i
think
you
are
an
athlete
by
jove
i
am
no
bread-and-butter
miss
at
any
rate
this
donkey
has
a
bad
pace
don't
you
think
i
kicked
the
brute
into
a
trot
and
ran
beside
it
the
hill
of
rakh
soon
began
to
loom
large
among
the
stars
on
the
horizon
i
suppose
you
were
pretty
wild
at
our
cavalier
treatment
of
you
the
other
evening
said
miss
ottley
well
yes
i
admitted
we
were
sorry
when
the
fight
came
no
doubt
said
i
it
served
us
right
eh
that
is
my
opinion
do
you
bear
malice
still
i
am
thinking
of
your
father's
wound
that
atones
your
twelve-mile
run
helps
but
you
are
still
angry
with
us
does
it
matter
i
am
serving
you
be
generous
said
miss
ottley
we
have
been
sufficiently
punished
not
only
have
we
lost
the
treasure
but
there
was
no
mummy
in
the
sarcophagus
be
a
lady
and
apologise
i
retorted
no
said
she
with
a
most
spirited
inflection
it
is
not
a
woman's
place
then
be
silent
or
change
the
topic
i
growled
she
was
silent
we
arrived
an
hour
later
at
the
mountain
i
was
bathed
in
perspiration
and
as
tired
as
a
dog
but
miss
ottley
had
no
time
to
notice
my
condition
she
slipped
off
the
donkey
and
hurried
away
through
the
smaller
of
the
three
pylons
that
fronted
a
small
temple
hollowed
out
of
the
rock
face
of
the
hill
there
was
no
sign
of
tent
so
i
concluded
that
sir
robert
had
made
his
camp
within
the
temple
i
hitched
the
ass
to
a
stake
and
cooled
off
thanking
providence
for
a
cool
breeze
that
swept
up
from
the
placid
surface
of
the
nile
day
was
already
showing
signs
of
breaking
and
a
broad
flight
of
long-legged
flamingoes
hurried
its
coming
with
a
flash
of
scarlet
just
above
the
eastern
horizon
the
distant
howling
of
a
hyena
was
borne
to
me
in
fitful
snatches
on
the
wind
the
earth
was
wrapped
in
mystery
and
melancholy
oh
egypt
egypt
land
of
sun-lit
spaces
and
illimitable
shadows
of
grandeur
and
of
squalor
without
peer
of
happy
dreams
and
sad
awakenings
of
centuries
ingloriously
oblivious
of
glory
of
sleep
and
sphinx-browed
age-bound
silences
of
darkly
smiling
and
impotent
despair
what
a
mistress
for
a
man
of
curiosity
and
of
imagination
little
wonder
that
since
i
had
been
caught
in
her
magic
and
most
jealous
spell
the
face
of
no
human
being
had
possessed
the
power
to
threaten
her
supremacy
or
cancel
my
allegiance
to
the
mystic
desert
queen
dr
pinsent
i
awoke
from
my
reverie
with
a
start
this
way
said
miss
ottley
i
bowed
and
followed
her
into
the
temple
through
a
broad
but
low
stone
doorway
past
a
row
of
broken
granite
columns
a
light
within
showed
us
the
path
the
chamber
was
about
eighteen
feet
square
there
was
another
of
equal
size
beyond
it
in
the
heart
of
the
hill
an
immense
sarcophagus
composed
entirely
of
lead
almost
blocked
the
door
the
lid
carved
to
represent
the
figure
and
face
of
a
tall
grave-featured
man
was
propped
up
on
end
against
a
pillar
the
sarcophagus
was
empty
beyond
stood
a
trestle
cot
a
table
and
a
lamp
sir
robert
ottley
lay
upon
the
cot
he
was
awake
but
evidently
unconscious
and
in
a
high
fever
i
examined
his
wound
and
prepared
for
action
there
was
an
oil
stove
in
the
room
i
lighted
it
and
set
water
to
boil
miss
ottley
watched
me
with
an
expression
i
shall
not
forget
easily
her
face
was
as
wan
as
that
of
a
ghost
and
her
big
red-brown
eyes
glowed
like
coals
and
were
ringed
with
purple
hollows
she
was
manifestly
worn
out
and
on
the
verge
of
a
breakdown
but
although
i
begged
her
to
retire
she
curtly
refused
judging
by
her
eyes
she
was
my
enemy
and
a
critical
enemy
at
that
when
everything
was
ready
i
walked
over
to
her
picked
her
up
in
my
arms
and
carried
her
struggling
like
a
wildcat
to
the
door
then
i
put
her
out
and
blocked
the
entrance
with
the
lid
of
the
sarcophagus
she
panted--i
hate
you
from
behind
it
then
she
began
to
cry
i
said
nothing
it
seemed
one
of
those
occasions
wherein
silence
was
golden
i
tied
sir
robert
to
the
cot
and
set
to
work
half
an
hour
later
i
found
the
bullet
under
his
clavicle
and
then
dressed
the
wound
and
bound
him
up
he
came
out
of
the
influence
of
the
anã¦sthetic
in
his
sober
senses
but
he
was
so
eager
to
tell
me
all
his
disappointment
that
i
gave
him
a
hypodermic
dose
of
morphia
and
he
dropped
asleep
in
the
middle
of
a
rabid
diatribe
against
arabs
in
general
and
our
arabs
in
particular
i
found
miss
ottley
reclining
against
a
ruined
pillar
in
an
angle
of
the
pylon
she
had
cried
herself
to
sleep
and
was
breathing
like
a
child
i
slipped
out
and
found
the
arab's
store-house
and
kitchen
luckily
the
gold
had
exhausted
their
cupidity
the
stores
were
untouched
i
lighted
a
fire
and
prepared
a
meal--coffee
and
curry
for
miss
ottley
and
myself
beef
tea
and
arrowroot
for
the
invalid
by
that
time
the
sun
was
riding
high
in
the
heavens
but
miss
ottley
still
slept
willing
to
assist
her
rest
i
secured
a
cushion
from
the
chamber
and
pushed
it
gently
beneath
her
head
she
sighed
and
turned
over
allowing
me
to
see
her
face
i
examined
it
and
found
it
good
the
features
were
well-nigh
perfect
from
the
little
grecian
nose
to
the
round
chin
but
it
was
a
face
instinct
with
pride
the
pride
of
a
female
lucifer
and
her
form
was
in
keeping
god
save
her
husband
was
my
conclusion
and
i
ate
a
hearty
breakfast
watching
her
and
pitying
him
whoever
he
should
be
sir
robert
woke
about
noon
and
although
a
little
feverish
i
was
quite
satisfied
with
his
progress
after
eating
a
dish
of
what
he
feelingly
described
as
muck
he
went
to
sleep
again
i
prepared
a
second
meal
and
brought
it
on
a
box
to
where
miss
ottley
still
lay
sleeping
then
i
sat
down
and
coughed
her
eyes
opened
at
once
and
she
looked
at
me
it
is
marvellous
what
a
woman's
glance
can
do
i
became
instantly
conscious
of
a
dirty
face
unkempt
hair
and
a
nine-weeks'
growth
of
beard
in
order
to
conceal
my
appreciation
of
my
ugliness
i
grinned
ugh
murmured
miss
ottley
and
she
got
up
sir
robert
is
asleep
i
observed
i
found
the
bullet
he
has
had
lunch
and
is
going
on
nicely
you
had
better
eat
something
she
gave
me
a
glance
of
scorn
and
glided
into
the
temple
i
helped
her
to
a
plate
of
curry
poured
out
a
cup
of
coffee
and
made
myself
scarce
returning
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
i
found
the
plate
bare
the
cup
empty
and
not
a
crumb
left
on
the
box
i
took
the
things
away
and
washed
them
and
my
own
face
then
i
shaved
with
a
pocket
amputation
knife
using
for
mirror
a
pot
of
soapy
water
and
i
brushed
my
too
abundant
locks
into
something
like
order
with
a
bunch
of
stubble
which
i
converted
into
a
hair
brush
with
a
tomahawk
and
a
piece
of
twine
feeling
prodigiously
civilised
and
almost
respectable
i
strolled
back
to
the
pylon
sat
down
on
miss
ottley's
cushion
and
lighted
my
pipe
about
two
minutes
later
miss
ottley
appeared
patient
awake
i
asked
no
said
miss
ottley
what
an
objectionable
smell
of
tobacco
war
to
the
knife
evidently
i
stood
up
when
you
need
me
shout
i
remarked
and
strolled
off
puffing
stolidly
but
i
saw
her
face
as
i
turned
and
it
was
crimson
perhaps
with
surprise
that
i
could
be
as
rude
as
she
perhaps
with
mortification
that
i
had
dared
if
ever
a
girl
needed
a
dressing
down
it
was
she
who
stood
in
the
pylon
staring
after
me
i
squatted
in
the
shadow
of
a
rock
and
spent
the
afternoon
stupefying
over-friendly
flies
with
the
fumes
of
prime
turkish
she
shouted
just
before
sundown
her
father
was
delirious
she
said
i
found
him
raving
and
tearing
at
his
bandages
he
was
haunted
with
an
hallucination
of
phantom
cats
the
whole
cavern
he
declared
was
filled
with
cats
black
as
erebus
with
flaming
yellow
eyes
i
shooed
them
away
and
after
some
trouble
calmed
the
poor
old
man
but
it
was
going
to
be
a
bad
case
that
was
plain
luckily
the
cave
temple
was
comparatively
speaking
cool
i
spent
the
evening
disinfecting
every
cranny
and
quietly
dispersing
the
suspicious
dust
of
vanished
centuries
when
i
had
finished
it
smelt
carbolically
wholesome
and
was
as
clean
as
a
london
hospital
even
to
the
ceiling
miss
ottley
sat
all
the
while
by
her
father's
cot
and
occasionally
sneezed
to
relieve
her
feelings
i
had
very
little
sympathy
for
her
distress
i
said
to
her
you
will
take
first
watch
i'll
sleep
in
the
pylon
call
me
at
midnight
then
i
placed
my
watch
on
the
edge
of
the
sarcophagus
and
went
out
she
said
nothing
i
woke
at
dawn
she
was
sitting
like
a
statue
beside
her
father's
bedside
her
face
was
grey
sir
robert
was
asleep
but
breathing
stertorously
i
beckoned
her
out
to
the
pylon
see
here
miss
ottley
i
said
in
a
cold
rage
i'm
not
going
to
beat
about
the
bush
with
you
i
told
you
to
call
me
at
midnight
kindly
explain
your
disobedience
i
am
not
your
servant
to
obey
your
orders
she
retorted
icily
no
said
i
you
prefer
to
serve
your
own
prickly
pride
to
behaving
sensibly
but
let
me
tell
you
this--your
father's
life
depends
on
careful
nursing
and
that
is
impossible
unless
we
apportion
the
work
properly
between
us
you'll
be
fit
for
nothing
today
and
my
task
will
be
doubled
in
consequence
a
little
more
of
such
folly
and
you'll
break
down
altogether
you
are
strung
up
to
more
than
concert
pitch
as
for
me--i
am
not
a
machine
and
though
i
am
prepared
to
do
my
best
out
of
mere
humanity
i
don't
pretend
to
do
the
impossible
nor
shall
i
answer
for
your
father's
life
if
you
force
me
to
nurse
two
patients
single-handed
she
looked
me
straight
in
the
eye
very
well
sir
i
shall
henceforth
rigidly
obey
you
you
must
i
said
and
strode
into
the
open
when
i
had
prepared
breakfast
she
did
not
want
to
eat
but
i
had
only
to
frown
and
she
succumbed
afterwards
i
made
her
lie
down
and
she
slept
through
sir
robert's
groaning
it
was
a
hideous
day
the
patient
grew
steadily
worse
and
so
great
was
his
strength
despite
his
diminutive
size
that
our
struggles
wore
me
out
at
last
and
i
was
obliged
to
strap
him
down
by
nightfall
he
was
a
maniac
and
his
yells
could
be
heard
i
make
no
doubt
a
mile
around
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
my
stock
of
bromide
was
gone
i
had
to
dose
him
with
morphia
but
i
had
not
to
speak
to
miss
ottley
again
she
woke
me
out
of
a
delicious
sleep
at
a
quarter
to
the
hour
she
was
quite
composed
but
as
pale
as
a
sheet
my
father
is
going
to
die
i
think
she
whispered
i
went
in
and
looked
at
him
he
was
straining
like
a
tiger
at
his
bonds
not
to-night
at
any
rate
i
observed
he
has
the
strength
of
six
you
go
straight
to
bed
she
went
off
as
meek
as
any
lamb
and
i
began
to
talk
to
sir
robert
our
conversation
was
somewhat
entertaining
he
was
ixion
chained
to
the
wheel
i
was
sisyphus
with
a
day
off
duty
we
commiserated
one
another
on
our
penalties
and
bitterly
assailed
king
pluto's
unsympathetic
government
finally
we
conspired
to
dethrone
him
and
give
the
crown
of
hades
to
proserpine
whose
putatively
tender
heart
might
be
reckoned
on
occasionally
to
mitigate
the
anguish
of
our
punishment
he
fell
into
a
fitful
doze
at
last
with
his
hand
in
mine
but
he
soon
awoke
and
with
a
yell
announced
the
return
of
the
imaginary
plague
of
cats
on
the
whole
the
night
was
worse
than
the
day
and
morning
was
no
blessing
sir
robert
had
shed
five
and
forty
years
he
was
once
again
at
college
and
if
his
unwilling
confessions
are
to
be
relied
upon
and
his
language
he
must
have
been
a
precious
handful
for
his
masters
but
now
he
steadily
lost
strength
and
the
flame
of
fever
ate
him
up
before
our
eyes
as
the
shadows
lengthened
into
afternoon
i
began
to
look
for
the
crisis
chapter
iii
two
lies
sleep
was
not
to
be
dreamed
of
that
night
for
either
of
us
well
people
i
had
thought
of
a
plan
leaving
miss
ottley
to
watch
the
unconscious
but
ceaselessly
babbling
patient
i
scoured
out
the
sarcophagus
and
then
built
an
enormous
fire
before
the
pylon
over
this
i
hung
the
arab's
cauldron
by
nightfall
i
had
the
sarcophagus
nigh
abrim
with
hot
water
it
formed
a
huge
but
most
admirable
bath
it
was
a
heroic
experiment
to
make
but
the
dark
angel
was
in
the
cavern
and
i
had
little
chance
left
kill
or
cure
it
seemed
a
toss
of
the
coin
either
way
for
sir
robert
was
dying
fast
after
the
bath
he
slipped
into
a
state
of
blank
insensibility
miss
ottley
thought
him
asleep
and
she
took
heart
to
hope
i
did
not
deceive
her
for
four
hours
i
waited
my
finger
continually
on
his
pulse
it
grew
continually
weaker
i
administered
nitro-glycerine
every
half
hour
but
at
length
even
that
spur
failed
miss
ottley
said
i
you
must
prepare
for
the
worst
she
showed
me
a
face
of
more
than
mortal
courage
pride
is
not
always
amiss
in
characters
like
hers
i
have
felt
it
all
along
she
said
quietly
will
he
regain
his
senses
yes
at
least
i
think
he
will--before
the
end
is
there
no
hope
none--unless
he
can
be
miraculously
aroused
pardon
me--is
he
very
much
attached
to
you
no--his
heart
and
soul
are
wrapped
up
in
his
work
he
died
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
hour
he
was
shot
his
terrible
disappointment
had
deprived
him
of
his
best
support
the
robbery
you
mean
no--the
knowledge
of
his
failure
he
made
certain
of
finding
the
body
of
ptahmes
ah
said
i--and
gave
myself
to
thought
when
i
looked
up
next
miss
ottley
was
gazing
at
her
father
with
a
marble
countenance
but
tears
were
streaming
from
her
eyes
you
love
him
i
whispered
more
than
all
the
world
she
answered
simply
her
voice
rang
as
true
and
unbroken
as
the
chiming
of
a
bell
i
began
in
spite
of
myself
to
admire
miss
ottley
ten
minutes
passed
minutes
of
hideously
oppressive
silence
then
without
warning
sir
robert's
eyelids
flickered
and
opened
there
was
the
light
of
reason
in
them
i
bent
over
him
and
his
glance
encountered
mine
i
pressed
his
hand
and
said
in
brisk
cheerful
tones
you
must
hurry
up
and
get
well
sir
robert
or
i
shall
not
be
able
to
restrain
my
curiosity
this
ptahmes
of
yours
is
the
most
extraordinary
mummy
i
have
ever
seen
and
i
am
simply
dying
to
take
him
from
his
shroud
the
dim
eyes
of
the
dying
man
actually
glowed
his
fingers
clutched
at
my
wrist
and
with
a
superhuman
effort
he
gasped
forth
no--no
be
easy
i
returned
i'll
not
touch
him
till
you
are
well
but
you
must
hurry
remember
we
are
of
a
trade
you
and
i
he
smiled
and
very
slowly
his
eyes
closed
his
breathing
was
absolutely
imperceptible
but
his
pulse
though
faint
was
regular
i
made
sure
and
then
put
down
his
hand
he
is
dead
said
miss
ottley
and
her
voice
thrilled
me
to
the
core
no
said
i
he
is
sleeping
like
a
babe
the
crisis
is
over
he
will
live
oh
my
god
she
cried
and
fell
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
shaken
with
a
storm
of
sobbing
i
sneaked
out
of
the
temple
and
smoked
my
first
pipe
in
three
days
i
was
only
half
through
it
when
i
felt
her
at
my
side
no
please
continue
smoking
she
said
i
like
it
really
i
have
come
to
try
and
thank
you
you
can't
i
replied
i'm
not
a
man
to
overestimate
his
own
services
but
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
cannot
be
repaid
by
either
gold
or
words
oh
she
said
you
see
i
went
on
i
lied
it
was
to
save
his
life--for
your
sake
the
sight
of
your
distress
touched
me
i
am
glad
that
he
will
live
of
course
glad
to
have
served
you
but
the
fact
remains
i
am
a
liar
dr
pinsent
she
cried
oh
i
daresay
i'll
grow
used
to
it
i
interrupted
cheerfully
perhaps
i
have
only
shed
a
superstition
after
all
i
confess
to
an
unwonted
feeling
of
freedom
too
undoubtedly
i
was
shackled
in
a
sense
yet
a
convict
chained
for
years
feels
naked
i
am
told
when
he
gets
suddenly
his
liberty
i
can
easily
believe
it
my
own
experience--but
enough
we
leave
the
patient
too
long
alone
she
flitted
off
like
a
phantom
and
as
noiselessly
i
refilled
my
pipe
an
hour
later
i
found
them
both
asleep
she
seated
on
the
camp-stool
leaning
back
against
the
tomb
nature
had
been
too
strong
for
her
poor
girl
i
felt
towards
her
the
brotherhood
of
vice
she
too
had
lied--in
pretending
a
little
while
before--a
hatred
of
tobacco
i
took
her
quietly
and
gently
in
my
arms
and
carried
her
to
her
own
cot
in
the
inner
cabin
she
did
not
wake
chapter
iv
the
sarcophagus's
perfume
towards
morning
my
mind
grew
much
easier
sir
robert
awoke
and
took
a
few
mouthfuls
of
liquid
nourishment
but
although
too
weak
to
speak
he
was
sensible
and
the
fever
had
left
him
he
fell
asleep
again
immediately
soon
afterwards
my
eyes
fell
on
the
sarcophagus
its
great
size
affected
me
with
wonder--and
its
construction
why
should
imperishable
treasures
gold
silver
and
precious
stones
be
enclosed
in
lead
why
not
in
stone
and
the
sarcophagus
had
been
hermetically
sealed
too
witness
the
chisel
and
saw
marks
on
the
lid
of
ottley's
making
i
examined
them
attentively
then
sat
down
and
stared
at
the
sarcophagus
again
it
was
coffin
shaped
why
if
it
had
been
intended
for
a
mere
treasure
chest
surely--i
was
struck
suddenly
by
a
fact
and
a
remembrance
the
sarcophagus
manifestly
measured
four
feet
high
at
least
and
i
remembered
that
in
filling
it
with
water
for
sir
robert's
bath
i
had
only
had
to
fill
eighteen
inches
in
depth
what
if
underneath
the
treasure
it
contained
another
chamber
overlaid
with
lead
there
was
room
i
got
afoot
and
measured
the
depth
of
water
on
my
arm
eighteen
well
certainly
not
more
than
nineteen
inches
i
seized
a
bucket
and
began
to
bail
the
water
out
having
need
to
be
noiseless
for
the
sleepers'
sake
the
task
occupied
the
better
part
of
half
an
hour
by
then
morning
had
begun
to
pale
the
lamplight
and
i
was
weary
but
i
kept
on
and
finally
mopped
the
interior
of
the
huge
basin
dry
with
a
towel
thereupon
i
examined
the
bottom
with
the
lamp
it
did
not
show
a
single
crevice
the
lead
was
in
a
solid
and
impervious
sheet
curious
but
the
difference
between
the
eighteen
inches
and
the
four
feet
remained
to
be
accounted
for
was
the
interspace
filled
with
lead
if
so--why
such
uneconomic
expenditure
of
a
valuable
mineral
the
mystery
interested
me
so
much
that
my
weariness
was
forgotten
i
felt
that
at
any
cost
it
must
be
solved
forthwith
casting
about
i
found
a
fine-pointed
and
razor-sharp
chisel
in
the
drawer
of
sir
robert
ottley's
camp
table
with
this
i
set
to
work
climbing
into
the
sarcophagus
i
selected
a
spot
and
using
the
weight
of
my
body
in
place
of
a
hammer
i
forced
the
chisel
into
the
lead
it
bit
into
the
metal
slowly
but
surely
one
inch
one
inch
and
a
half
suddenly
it
slipped
i
fell
forward
and
was
brought
up
by
the
handle
the
mystery
was
solved
i
recovered
my
position
and
wiped
my
forehead
instantly
a
thin
but
strangely
overpowering
perfume
filled
my
nostrils
it
resembled
camphor
and
violets
and
lavender
and
oil
of
almonds
and
a
hundred
other
scents
but
was
truly
like
none
of
them
it
created
and
compelled
however
a
confused
train
of
untranslatable
reflections
which
might
have
been
memories
but
god
knows
what
they
were
i
experienced
a
mysterious
sensation
of
immeasurable
antiquity
and
wildly
absurd
as
the
idea
appears
set
forth
in
sober
language
something
assured
me
that
i
was
thousands
of
years
old
or
had
lived
before--so
long--so
very
long
ago
i
saw
lights--the
sound
of
chanting
voices
and
of
rushing
waters
filled
my
ears
i
seemed
to
be
assisting
at
a
solemn
ritual
ghostly
forces
and
dim
spirit
figures
filled
the
cave
the
air
was
thick
with
incense
fumes
my
reason
rocked
and
swung
just
in
time
i
realised
that
i
was
becoming
mysteriously
anã¦sthetised
i
held
my
breath
and
with
a
powerful
effort
leaped
to
the
floor
then
i
carefully
blocked
up
the
chisel
hole
with
my
kerchief
and
staggered
into
the
open
air
very
soon
i
was
my
own
man
again
returning
filled
with
apprehension
for
the
patient
i
found
nothing
to
alarm
me
the
perfume
had
absolutely
disappeared
sir
robert
was
sleeping
like
a
babe
i
took
a
nip
of
brandy
and
sitting
down
gave
myself
to
dreams
watching
the
sarcophagus
what
was
its
secret
and
what
the
secret
of
sir
robert
ottley's
passionate
interest
in
the
corpse
of
ptahmes
that
had
been
potent
enough
to
call
him
back
to
life
from
the
very
brink
of
dissolution
but
plainly
i
must
wait
to
learn
for
it
would
not
do
to
trifle
with
the
perfume
in
the
cavern
in
that
confined
space
it
might
bring
about
the
destruction
of
us
all
already
it
had
affected
me
my
head
ached
fearfully
and
i
knew
that
my
blood
vessels
were
distended
and
that
my
heart
was
still
violently
excited
my
agitation
was
not
all
painful
there
was
an
insidious
pleasure
mingled
with
it
an
intangible
titillation
of
the
nerves
but
that
only
alarmed
me
the
more
the
poisons
that
are
most
to
be
feared
are
those
which
captivate
the
senses
they
convey
no
warning
to
the
body
and
betray
the
mind
however
watchful
by
effecting
a
paralysis
of
will
perhaps--unwittingly--i
had
been
very
near
death
the
notion
was
disturbing
i
began
to
regard
the
sarcophagus
much
in
the
light
of
an
infernal
machine
possessing
dangerous
potentialities
for
ill
i
determined
as
soon
as
possible--that
is
to
say
as
soon
as
help
arrived--to
have
it
removed
from
the
sick
room
to
the
pylon
there
at
least
it
would
be
less
manifestly
perilous
having
the
play
of
the
whole
wide
desert
atmosphere
in
which
to
dissipate
its
noxious
energies
a
rustling
sound
dissolved
my
meditations
i
glanced
up
and
saw
miss
ottley
bending
over
her
father
i
slipped
out
and
sought
the
arab's
quarters
soon
i
had
a
good
fire
alight
and
water
on
to
boil
i
rather
spread
myself
that
morning
i
cooked
some
tinned
asparagus
boiled
a
tinned
chicken
and
opened
a
jar
of
prunes
breakfast
spread
on
the
lid
of
a
brandy
box
looked
and
smelled
very
good
i
carried
it
up
to
the
pylon
and
whistled
come
into
the
garden
maude
miss
ottley
appeared
at
once
round
eyed
with
surprise
your
father
has
already
eaten
i
observed
in
all
likelihood
he
will
sleep
for
hours
yet
kindly
sit
down
you'll
excuse
my
novel
breakfast
call
it
is
the
only
invitational
air
i
am
acquainted
with
she
stared
at
me
may
one
not
be
lighthearted
when
all
goes
well
i
asked
one
may
she
answered
then
her
eyes
fell
and
she
coloured
painfully
but
not
two
i
slept
at
my
post
oh
how
could
i
her
voice
was
quite
despairing
and
bitterly
contemptuous
i
bit
at
the
leg
of
a
chicken
which
i
held
in
my
fingers
after
all
you
are
a
woman
you
know
i
commented
with
my
mouth
full
this
chick's
prime--done
to
a
turn
how
tired
you
must
be
i'm
not
complaining
nor
do
i
grudge
you
the
extra
rest
you
look
better
hungry
y-yes
she
admitted
then
don't
be
a
ninny
spending
time
in
vain
regrets
fall
to
and
repair
your
waste
tissues
in
plain
english--eat
she
sat
down
on
a
ruined
column
and
i
handed
her
a
plate
you
look--positively
merry
she
said
you
are
nursing
some--pleasant--or
profitable
reflection
she
considered
the
words
with
care
i
have
discovered
that
i
may
have--told
the
truth
to
your
father
last
night
after
all
by
accident
i
beg
your
pardon
i
believe
i
have
found
your
friend
ptahmes
miss
ottley
the
plate
slid
off
her
lap
and
broke
chicken
and
gravy
littered
the
pavement
but
she
had
no
idea
of
it
impossible
she
cried
i
explained
my
examination
of
the
sarcophagus
and
the
result
in
detail
she
sat
gazing
at
me
like
a
graven
image
when
she
had
finished
she
arose
and
vanished--without
a
word
i
followed
and
found
her
standing
beside
the
great
lead
coffin
my
kerchief
in
her
hand
she
had
reopened
the
chisel
hole
and
the
cavern
was
already
saturated
with
the
infernal
gas
i
snatched
my
handkerchief
away
and
once
more
blocked
the
vent
then
i
exerted
all
my
strength
and
with
a
prodigious
effort
placed
the
lid
on
the
sarcophagus
with
a
woman's
curiosity
to
reckon
with
such
a
precaution
seemed
a
vital
safeguard
i
found
her
standing
in
the
pylon
breathing
like
a
spent
runner
you
might
have
taken
my
word
i
said
coldly
you'd
have
saved
yourself
an
ugly
headache
at
the
least
her
face
was
crimson
her
eyes
burned
like
stars
the
fumes
of
that
uncanny
perfume
had
made
her
drunk
she
swayed
and
leaned
dizzily
against
a
pillar
i
went
up
and
took
her
hand
the
pulse
was
beating
like
a
miniature
steam
hammer
sit
down
i
said
she
laughed
and
sank
at
my
feet
in
a
heap
oh
oh
she
cried
and
fell
to
sobbing
half
hysterically
though
tearlessly
lord
i
said
aloud
what
a
bundle
of
hysterical
humours
it
is
and
how
plain
to
look
on
when
its
resolution
takes
a
holiday
that
is
the
way
to
treat
hysteria
miss
ottley
sat
up
and
withered
me
with
a
glance
i--i
am
it--it's
not
hysteria
she
stammered
between
gasps
besides--you--confessed--it--overcame--you
too
then
she
fainted
i
sprang
up
but
even
as
i
moved
i
heard
a
loud
sigh
in
the
cavern
the
sick
man
first
i
muttered
and
let
the
girl
lie
but
at
the
door
of
the
cavern
chamber
i
stood
transfixed
a
dark
shape
bent
over
the
patient's
cot
hiding
sir
robert
ottley's
face
from
view
it
seemed
to
be
a
man
but
its
back
was
presented
to
my
gaze
what
the
deuce
are
you
doing
here
whoever
you
are
i
cried
out
and
started
forward
the
shape
melted
on
the
instant
into
thinnest
air
nothing
but
a
shadow
i
said
to
myself
it
was
necessary
to
say
something
i
was
shocked
to
my
soul
i
stood
for
a
moment
shaking
and
dismayed
the
shadow
had
been
so
thick
and
bodily
and
had
fled
so
like
a
spirit
that
i
had
work
to
do
to
readjust
my
scattered
faculties
of
course
a
shadow--and
my
eyes
dazzled
by
the
sunlight
without
had
momentarily
failed
to
pierce
it
a
reasonable
and
quite
ample
scientific
explanation
but
what
had
cast
the
shadow
pish--what
but
myself
and
yet
and
yet
i
was
shivering
like
a
blancmange
never
had
my
nerves
used
me
so
ill
perhaps
however
that
accursed
perfume
had
affected
them
ah
there
was
a
reassuring
solution
of
the
puzzle
reassuring
to
my
reason
be
it
understood
for
the
fleshy
part
of
me
was
taken
with
an
ague
and
refused
for
many
seconds
to
return
to
its
subjection
to
my
will
sometimes
now
i
doubt
but
that
the
flesh
has
an
intelligence
apart
from
the
brain
cells
and
nerve
structures
that
usually
control
it
indeed
i
have
never
met
a
man
of
intellect
whose
memory
does
not
register
experience
of
some
occasion
in
which
his
flesh
took
independent
fright--like
a
startled
hare--at
some
bogie
which
made
his
sober
reason
subsequently
smile
nay
contemptuously
at
times
well
well
i
said
at
length
and
pushed
forward--to
receive
another
shock
sir
robert
ottley
was
almost
nude
the
bed
clothes
had
been
pushed
down
past
his
waist
his
fingers
convulsively
gripped
the
paillasse
his
face
was
livid
his
eyes
were
open
and
upturned
his
whole
form
was
stiff
and
rigid
a
fit
it
seemed
so
his
pulse
was
still
he
did
not
breathe
but
a
cataleptic
fit
then
for
at
a
lance
prick
the
blood
flowed
i
forced
him
to
his
right
side
and
tried
massage
no
use
strychnine
and
nitro-glycerine
equally
refused
to
act
finally
i
saturated
a
cloth
with
amyl
nitrate
placed
it
over
his
open
mouth
and
tried
artificial
respiration
a
whole
hour
had
passed
already
but
i
refused
to
give
in
it
was
well
in
another
twenty
minutes
my
efforts
were
rewarded
with
a
sigh
i
kept
on
and
the
man
began
to
breathe
when
it
seemed
safe
to
leave
off
i
disposed
him
easily
and
watched
events
first
his
normal
colouring
returned
then
his
mouth
closed
finally
his
eyes
revolved
the
lids
closed
and
opened
several
times
then
rested
closed
his
pulse
beat
feverishly
but
in
spite
of
that
he
slept
i
walked
to
the
door
miss
ottley--whom
i
had
completely
forgotten--still
lay
insensible
where
she
had
fallen
i
picked
her
up
and
brought
her
into
the
cavern
she
awoke
to
consciousness
in
transit
i
forced
her
to
drink
a
stiff
nobbler
of
brandy
and
very
soon
she
was
in
her
old
cold
bright
proud
self-reliant
state--armed
cap-a-pie
with
insolence
and
egotism
is
your
father
subject
to
fits
i
asked
he
has
never
had
till
this
a
day's
illness
in
his
life
she
responded--with
a
touch
of
indignation
i
nodded
well
his
period
of
disease
indemnity
has
passed
while
you
swooned
he
had
a
fit
i
use
the
expression
colloquially
you
would
probably
have
so
described
his
condition
had
you
seen
him
as
for
me
i
don't
know
the
symptoms
were
unique
i
restored
him
by
treating
him
as
a
drowned
man
he
was
in
a
sort
of
trance
from
this
moment
he
must
never
be
left
even
for
a
second
he
was
insensible
he
was
inanimate
that
perfume
she
cried
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
no
doubt
we
glanced
at
the
sarcophagus
then
at
each
other
was
there
need
she
asked
colouring
then
her
eyes
sparkled
oh
for
such
strength
she
cried
it
took
six
arabs
to
lift
that
coffin
lid
you
must
be
a
samson
fortunately
i
observed
her
brows
drew
together
and
her
lips
you
treat
me
in
a
way
that
i
resent
she
said
i
am
as
reasonable
a
being
as
yourself
i
retired
to
a
corner
and
stretched
myself
upon
the
floor
without
replying
when
do
you
wish
to
be
aroused
she
asked
an
hour
before
sunset
we
must
eat--that
is
i
you
appear
to
thrive
on
air
she
bit
her
lips
and
i
stared
at
the
ceiling
i
was
dog-tired
but
could
not
sleep
i
counted
a
thousand
and
then
glanced
at
miss
ottley
her
gaze
was
fixed
on
me
you
are
overtired
she
said
and
her
tone
was
pure
womanly
it
irritated
and
amused
me
to
find
she
could
so
unaffectedly
assume
it
i
smiled
she
interpreted
the
smile
aloud
what
sound
reason
have
you
for
despising
me
she
asked
you
pretend
to
be
a
scientist
answer
me
as
such
rejecting
bias
i
don't
said
i
then
you
dislike
me
why
i
don't
her
lip
curled
oh
indeed
she
arose
and
brought
me
a
cushion
i
took
it
and
our
hands
touched
i
must
conclude
then
that
you
like
me
she
drew
her
hand
swiftly
away
and
returned
to
her
seat
i
smiled
again
undoubtedly
miss
ottley
thank
you
the
tone
was
instinct
with
sarcasm
confess
that
you
are
craving
for
a
little
human
sympathy
i
she
exclaimed
and
started
haughtily
being
a
woman
and
in
a
simply
damnable
position
ah
she
cried
you
admit
that
my
dear
girl
whenever
i
think
of
it
your
pluck
amazes
me
to
my
astonishment
her
eyes
closed
and
her
bosom
heaved
then
i
saw
such
a
struggle
as
i
do
not
wish
ever
to
witness
again
pride
prevented
her
from
raising
her
hand
to
hide
her
face
and
pride
put
up
a
superhuman
fight
with
human
weakness
her
features
were
distorted
one
could
see
that
soul
and
body
were
engaged
in
mortal
combat
that
spectacle
was
poignantly
fascinating
i
thrilled
to
see
it
and
yet
hated
myself
for
not
being
able
to
look
away
why--who
knows
but
at
length
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
i
got
up
and
shook
her
gently
she
stiffened
into
marble
but
did
not
offer
to
resist
me
peace
peace
i
said
you
foolish
foolish
child
you
are
wasting
forces
that
were
given
you
for
quite
another
purpose
suddenly
her
eyes
opened
and
looked
straight
in
mine
what
she
questioned
and
two
great
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
why
do
you
hate
your
sex
i
asked
god
knows
it
is
more
valuable
than
mine
man
she
muttered--and
shuddered
from
me--bitterly
defiant
woman
i
retorted
and
each
of
us
with
a
fateful
mission
to
fulfil
not
to
fight
against
yours
to
sting
to
hurt
to
crush
and
yours
to
foster
and
create
a
better
finer-natured
breed
generous
she
sneered
is
it
possible
my
dear
girl
said
i
i
haven't
a
temper
to
lose
i
am
a
sober
cold-blooded
man
of
the
world
of
thirty
i
laughed
out
heartily
then
stopped
remembering
the
patient
he
stirred
and
we
both
hurried
to
his
side
but
he
did
not
wake
i
looked
up
and
offered
miss
ottley
my
right
hand
we
started
badly
i
whispered
but
still
we
may
be
friends
her
eyes
darkened
with
anger
she
stood
like
a
statue
regarding
me
her
expression
sphinx-like
and
brooding
instinct
says
one
thing
and
pride
another
i
hazarded
she
coloured
to
her
chin
but
her
firm
glance
did
not
falter
ah
well
said
i
and
made
off
to
my
stone
couch
convinced
that
a
man
who
argues
with
a
woman
is
a
fool
and
i
was
punished
properly
she
haunted
my
dreams
chapter
v
the
shadow
in
the
cave
we
ate
heartily
the
pair
of
us
that
evening
the
effect
on
me
was
comforting
and
humanising
i
felt
well
disposed
to
my
fellow
man--and
woman
and
inclined
to
sanguine
expectations
miss
ottley
however
was
as
usual
impenetrable
she
belonged
of
right
to
the
age
of
iron
a
female
anachronism
to
cheer
her
i
suggested
a
game
of
chess
she
consented
and
mated
me
in
fourteen
moves
we
played
again
and
once
more
she
beat
me
my
outspoken
admiration
of
her
skill--i
rather
fancy
my
own
play
at
chess--left
her
perfectly
imperturbable
in
the
third
game
she
predicted
my
defeat
at
the
eleventh
move
on
making
her
own
fourth
i
did
my
best
but
her
prophecy
was
fulfilled
enough
said
i
and
retiring
to
the
door
way
i
lighted
a
cigarette
hassan
ali
our
dragoman
should
be
here
to-morrow
she
presently
remarked
with
troops
they
will
never
catch
our
rascal
arabs
i
replied
with
five
clear
days'
start
those
beggars
might
be
anywhere
just
so
said
she
but
they
will
be
of
some
use
none
the
less--if
only
to
drag
that
sarcophagus
out
of
the
temple
eh
i
exclaimed--and
looked
at
her
sharply
what
is
the
matter
with
the
thing--here
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
then
of
a
sudden
smiled
do
you
wish
to
be
amused
of
all
things
then
prepare
to
laugh
at
me
while
you
slept
this
afternoon----
she
paused
yes
i
said
my
father
awoke
oh
and
conversed
good
i
murmured
he
was
sensible
i
do
not
know
he
seemed
so
but
he
did
not
speak
to
me
you
said
that
he
conversed
ay--but
with
a
shadow
miss
ottley
compressed
her
lips
and
looked
at
me
defiantly
a
shadow
she
repeated
i
saw
it
distinctly
it
moved
across
the
room
and
stood
beside
the
cot
it
was
the
shadow
of
a
man
but
you
are
not
laughing
not
yet
said
i
had
this
shadow
a
voice
no
what
did
your
father
say
to
it
he
implored
it
to
be
patient
and
the
shadow
vanished
and
you
i
told
myself
i
dreamed
i
tried
not
to
die
of
terror
and
succeeded
why
did
you
not
wake
me
i
wished
to
but
the
shadow
intervened
it
reappeared
for
a
second
that
reduced
me
to
a
state
of
trembling
imbecility
that
infernal
perfume
has
simply
shattered
your
nerves
i
commented
cheerfully
you'll
be
better
after
a
good
rest
overstrain
and
anxiety
of
course
are
to
a
degree
responsible
indeed
they
might
be
held
accountable
for
the
hallucination
alone
but
i
blame
the
perfume
to
a
great
extent
because
it
similarly
affected
me
what
she
cried
you
saw
a
shadow
too
i
laughed
softly
my
own--no
other
but
its
appearance
shocked
me
horribly
in
my
opinion
that
coffin
perfume
works
powerfully
upon
the
optic
nerve
how
are
you
feeling
now
as
well
as
ever
in
my
life
no
fears
none
but
i
admit
a
distrust
of
that
sarcophagus--or
rather
of
the
perfume
it
contains
are
you
sure
that
you
stopped
up
the
chisel
hole
securely
quite
but
pardon
me
miss
ottley
you
are
looking
weary
take
my
advice
and
retire
now
thanks
i
shall
she
said
and
with
a
cool
bow
she
went
into
the
inner
chamber
an
hour
later
sir
robert
awoke
he
was
quite
sensible
and
appeared
much
better
i
fed
him
and
we
exchanged
a
few
cheerful
remarks
he
declared
that
he
had
turned
the
corner
and
expressed
a
strong
desire
to
be
up
and
about
his
work
again
he
also
asked
after
his
daughter
and
thanked
me
warmly
for
my
services
soon
afterwards
he
dropped
off
into
a
tranquil
slumber
and
i
spent
the
remainder
of
my
watch
reading
a
review
as
i
was
not
very
tired
i
gave
miss
ottley
grace
and
it
was
a
quarter
to
one
when
i
awakened
her
she
came
out
looking
as
fresh
as
a
rose
her
cheeks
scarlet
from
their
plunge
in
cool
water
and
consequent
towelling
she
invited
me
to
use
her
couch
but
i
declined
and
sought
my
accustomed
corner
i
slept
like
the
dead--for
i
subsequently
discovered
just
about
an
hour
but
then
i
awoke
choking
and
gasping
for
breath
i
had
an
abominable
sensation
of
strong
fingers
clutched
about
my
throat
at
first
all
was
dark
before
me
but
struggling
afoot
the
shadows
receded
from
my
eyes
and
i
saw
the
lamp--a
second
afterwards
miss
ottley
she
stood
with
her
back
against
the
further
wall
of
the
chamber
her
hands
outstretched
as
if
to
repel
an
impetuous
opponent
and
her
face
was
cast
in
an
expression
of
unutterable
terror
miss
ottley
i
cried
she
uttered
a
strangled
scream
then
staggered
towards
me
oh
thank
god--you
were
too
strong--for
him
she
gasped
he
tried
to
kill
you--and
i
could
not
move
nor
cry
who
i
demanded
the--the
shadow
she
caught
my
arms
and
gripped
them
with
hysterical
vigour
i
forced
her
to
sit
down
and
hurried
to
her
father
he
was
sleeping
like
a
babe
i
thought
of
the
asphyxiating
sensation
i
had
experienced
and
stepped
gently
to
my
sleeping
corner
kneeling
down
i
struck
a
match
the
flame
burned
steadily
not
carbonic
acid
gas
then
at
all
events
but
i
tried
the
whole
room
to
make
sure
also
the
interior
of
the
sarcophagus
but
without
result
so
far
baffled
i
stood
up
and
thought
what
agency
had
been
at
work
to
disturb
us
i
made
a
tour
of
the
walls
and
examined
the
stones
of
their
construction
one
by
one
it
seemed
just
possible
that
there
might
be
a
secret
entrance
to
the
chamber
and
some
robber
arab
acquainted
with
it
might
be
employing
it
for
evil
ends
but
i
was
forced
to
abandon
that
idea
like
the
other
and
no
one
had
entered
through
the
pylon
for
the
dust
about
the
doorway
was
absolutely
impressionless
what
then
i
turned
to
miss
ottley
she
was
watching
me
with
evidently
painful
expectation
her
hands
tightly
clasped
what
made
you
think
the
shadow
wished
to
kill
me
i
inquired
i
saw
its
face
oh
it
has
a
face
now
eh
the
face
of
a
devil
and
long
thin
hands
it
fastened
them
about
your
throat
my
dear
girl
don't
be
a
fool
she
retorted
stormily
what
aroused
you
did
you
hear
me
call
i
was
confounded
very
good
i
said
i
admit
the
hands
at
least
for
the
nonce
for
truly
i
was
half
strangled
but
what
do
you
infer
can
human
creatures
make
themselves
invisible
at
will
my
good
miss
ottley
no
but
they
can
run
away
do
you
want
to
see
the
shadow's
face
yes
then
look
on
the
lid
of
the
sarcophagus
and
see
its
portrait
in
a
gentle
mood
ptahmes
i
cried
ay
ptahmes
she
said
slowly
we
are
haunted
by
his
spirit
i
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
sarcophagus
and
lit
a
cigarette
i
am
quite
at
a
present
loss
to
explain
my
throttling
i
observed
but
that
is
the
only
mystery
i
reject
your
shadow
with
the
contempt
that
it
deserves
what
you
saw
was
some
wandering
arab
who
hopped
in
here
without
troubling
to
tread
through
the
dust
in
the
doorway
and
who
departed
in
the
same
fashion
pish
there
too
is
the
mystery
of
my
throttling
solved
perhaps
said
she
indeed
i
hope
so
she
was
still
trembling
in
spasms
are
you
minded
for
the
experiment
i
asked
what
is
it
i
wish
to
drive
this
foolish
fancy
from
your
mind
i
took
out
my
revolver
and
showed
it
to
her
spirits
are
said
to
love
the
dark
best
let
us
put
out
the
lamp
it's
their
element
how
then
can
we
better
tempt
old
ptahmes
from
his
tomb
i
wound
up
with
a
laugh
i
can
promise
him
a
warm
reception
miss
ottley
shivered
and
grew
if
possible
paler
than
before
but
her
pride
was
equal
to
the
challenge
very
well
she
said
i
drew
up
a
stool
near
hers
put
out
the
lamp
and
sat
down
when
my
cigarette
had
burned
out
the
darkness
was
blacker
than
the
blackest
ebony
an
idea
runs
in
my
head
that
spirits
respond
most
surely
to
silent
wooers
i
murmured
but
i
have
no
experience
have
you
n-no
said
miss
ottley
the
poor
girl
was
shivering
with
fear
and
too
proud
to
admit
it
i
sought
about
for
a
pretext
to
comfort
her
and
found
one
presently
don't
they
join
hands
at
a
sã©ance
i
inquired
i--i--t-think
so
said
miss
ottley
well
then
our
hands
encountered
hers
was
pitifully
cold
i
enclosed
it
firmly
in
my
left
and
held
it
on
my
knee
she
sighed
but
ever
so
softly
trying
to
prevent
my
hearing
it
thereafter
we
were
silent
for
very
long
listening
to
the
sick
man's
quiet
breathing
no
other
sound
was
to
be
heard
but
soon
miss
ottley's
hand
grew
warm
and
the
fingers
twined
around
mine
it
felt
a
nice
good
little
hand
it
was
very
small
yet
firm
and
silken-smooth
and
it
possessed
a
strange
electric
quality
it
made
mine
tingle--a
distinctly
pleasurable
sensation
i
fell
into
a
dreamy
mood
and
i
think
i
must
have
indulged
in
forty
winks
when
all
of
a
sudden
miss
ottley's
hand
aroused
me
her
fingers
were
gripping
mine
with
the
force
of
a
vice
she
was
breathing
hard
what
is
it
i
whispered
there
is
some--presence
in
the
room
she
gasped
don't
you
feel
it
illustration
the
living
mummy
three
paces
off
a
man's
face
glowered
at
us
face
page
48
and
as
i
live
i
did
i
struck
a
match
and
sprang
afoot
three
paces
off
a
man's
face
glowered
at
us
in
the
fitful
glimmer
of
the
lucifer
its
characteristics
were
so
unusual
that
it
is
not
possible
ever
to
forget
them
the
eyes
were
large
dark
and
singularly
dull
they
were
set
at
an
extraordinary
distance
apart
in
the
skull
six
inches
i
should
say
at
least
but
the
head
though
abnormally
broad
thereabouts
tapered
to
a
point
in
the
chin
and
was
cone-shaped
above
the
wide
receding
temples
the
cheek
bones
were
high
and
prominent
they
shone
in
the
match
light
almost
white
in
contrast
with
the
dark
skin
of
the
more
shaded
portions
of
the
countenance
the
nose
was
long
and
aquiline
but
the
nostrils
were
broad
and
compressed
at
the
base
pointing
at
negroid
ancestry
the
mouth
wide
and
thin-lipped
was
tightly
shut
the
chin
was
long
sharp
and
hairless
the
ears
were
bat-shaped
recovering
from
my
first
shock
of
amazement
i
addressed
the
intruder
in
arabic
what
are
you
doing
here
what
do
you
want
i
cried
he
did
not
answer
enraged
i
started
forward
and
hit
out
from
the
shoulder
striking
air
the
match
went
out
i
lit
another
the
man
had
vanished
i
relighted
the
lamp
and
carefully
examined
the
chamber
but
our
visitor
had
not
left
the
slightest
sign
of
his
intrusion
i
shook
my
head
and
went
over
to
miss
ottley
she
was
leaning
against
the
wall
with
her
eyes
shut
her
bosom
heaving
painfully
i
touched
her
and
she
started--suppressing
a
shriek
her
lips
were
trickling
blood
where
she
had
bitten
them
her
face
was
ghastly
and
she
seemed
about
to
swoon
pish
i
cried
there
is
nothing
to
be
frightened
of
a
rascally
arab--knows
some
secret
way
of
entering
this
cavern
that
is
all
she
swayed
towards
me
i
caught
her
as
she
fell
and
bore
her
to
a
stool
but
though
quite
overcome
she
was
not
unconscious
yet
her
fortitude
was
broken
down
at
last
and
she
was
helpless
she
could
not
even
sit
up
unassisted
placing
her
on
the
floor
a
while
i
made
her
drink
some
spirit
and
then
lifting
her
upon
my
knee
i
rocked
her
in
my
arms
like
a
child
and
did
my
best
to
soothe
her
fears
heavens
how
she
cried
my
handkerchief
was
soon
as
wet
as
if
i
had
soused
it
in
a
basin
of
water
and
yet
she
still
cried
on
i
spoke
to
her
all
the
time
i
told
her
that
i
would
answer
for
her
safety
with
my
life
and
all
sorts
of
things
and
thinking
of
her
as
a
poor
little
child
i
called
her
dear
continually
and
darling--and
i
let
her
weep
herself
into
an
exhausted
sleep
upon
my
breast
and
when
that
happened
i
did
not
need
anyone
to
tell
me
that
science
was
no
longer
the
mistress
of
my
fate
or
that
i
a
comparative
pauper
had
committed
the
unutterable
folly
of
falling
in
love
with
the
daughter
of
a
millionaire--whose
religion
was
pride
with
a
capital
p
i
held
her
so
till
dawn
staring
dumbly
at
her
face
and
thus
when
her
eyes
opened
they
looked
straight
into
mine
she
did
not
move
and
half-unwillingly
my
arms
tightened
round
her
the
bad
dream
is
over
little
girl
i
whispered
see--the
golden
sunlight
may--may
said
sir
robert's
voice
she
started
up
her
face
aflame
i
followed
her
to
the
bedside
the
patient
was
awake
and
strong
and
hungry
also
querulous
he
complained
of
the
pain
of
the
wound
and
ordered
me
to
dress
it
he
had
seen
nothing
but
i
knew
miss
ottley
would
not
forgive
me
on
that
account
i
read
it
in
her
eyes
after
i
had
dressed
the
patient's
wound
and
we
had
fed
him
she
followed
me
to
the
door
you
had
no
right
to
let
me
sleep--like
that
she
said
imperiously
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
insult
her
or
to
prove
myself
an
adventurer
i
had
no
mind
for
the
latter
course
quite
right
i
returned
when
you
behaved
like
an
idiot
i
should
have
treated
you
as
such
and
left
you
to
recover
from
your
own
silly
terror
instead
of
acting
the
soft
fool
and
losing
my
own
rest
in
serving
you
i'll
do
it
too--next
time
what
will
you
have
for
breakfast
she
swung
on
her
heel
and
left
me
chapter
vi
enter
dr
belleville
while
waiting
for
the
kettle
to
boil
i
happened
to
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
nile
a
column
of
moving
smoke
at
once
attracted
my
attention
a
launch
of
course
and
what
more
likely
than
that
it
should
contain
soldiers
arabs
servants
and
a
surgeon
i
shall
soon
be
free
to
return
to
my
work
it
seems
i
said
aloud
and
it
is
wonderful
what
a
lot
of
dissatisfaction
the
reflection
gave
me
i
came
within
an
ace
indeed
of
consigning
the
nile
monuments
to
literary
perdition
but
only
temporarily
for
i
felt
that
i
should
need
as
engrossing
mental
occupation
soon
work
is
a
fine
consoler
the
party
arrived
a
few
minutes
before
noon
it
consisted
of
sir
robert
ottley's
dragoman
half
a
company
of
egyptian
camel
corps
under
command
of
a
fussy
little
english-french
lieutenant
named
thomas
dubois
some
twenty
swart-faced
fellaheen
labourers
and
two
english
friends
of
sir
robert
and
his
daughter
the
latter
were
rather
singular
personages
one
was
middle-aged
short
and
thick
and
bearded
like
the
pard
up
to
his
very
eyes
he
rejoiced
in
the
name
of
william
belleville
and
was
a
fellow
of
the
royal
college
of
surgeons
the
other
one
was
tall
and
thin
and
marvellously
good-looking
he
called
himself
captain
frankfort
weldon
and
i
soon
discovered
was
an
honourable
preparatory
to
discharging
myself
in
toto
of
my
responsibilities
i
took
charge
of
the
entire
crowd
i
have
been
assured
by
my
best
friends
that
i
am
a
natural
autocrat
those
who
are
not
my
friends
have
sometimes
described
me
as
an
arrogant
and
self-assertive
egotist
i
contend
however
that
i
was
eminently
well
qualified
to
judge
what
was
best
to
be
done
in
that
instance
at
all
events
and
it
is
not
my
fault
that
weldon
and
belleville
chose
to
consider
themselves
slighted
because
i
did
not
ask
their
advice
within
ten
minutes
i
had
sent
the
camel
soldiers
packing
across
the
desert
in
the
direction
taken
by
the
arab
robbers
they
did
not
want
to
go
in
the
least
but
i
put
my
foot
down
hard
and
they
went
without
losing
a
moment
thereafter
i
made
the
fellaheen
erect
a
large
double
tent
in
a
shaded
cleft
in
the
mountain
at
some
distance
from
the
temple
it
did
not
take
them
long
for
i
directed
their
operations
personally
i
then
marched
them
to
the
temple
miss
ottley
was
talking
to
the
englishmen
in
the
pylon
i
bowed
and
passed
her
followed
by
the
fellaheen
i
gave
to
each
man
a
task
the
carriage
of
some
piece
of
furniture
the
two
strongest
i
appointed
as
bearers
of
sir
robert
ottley's
cot
the
baronet
was
awake
he
questioned
me
what
are
you
doing
pinsent
i'm
going
to
move
you
to
a
tent
for
better
air
to
hasten
your
recovery
i
said
he
only
sighed
and
wearily
closed
his
eyes
then
the
procession
started
when
miss
ottley
saw
her
father
being
carried
out
she
was
so
surprised
that
she
stood
dumb
turning
round
a
little
later
i
saw
that
she
and
her
friends
were
conversing
amiably
arrived
at
the
tents
i
fixed
the
patient
comfortably
then
arranged
the
furniture
in
both
apartments
the
outer
of
course
was
to
be
miss
ottley's
room
when
all
was
done
i
dismissed
the
fellaheen
to
other
tasks
and
walked
up
to
ottley's
cot
sir
robert
said
i
his
eyes
opened
and
he
looked
at
me
you
know
that
your
friend
dr
belleville
has
come
yes--we
have
had
a
chat
so
well
i
now
propose
to
turn
the
case
over
to
him
your
recovery
should
be
rapid
you
are
already
practically
convalescent
you
are
leaving
me
you
no
longer
need
my
services
how
can
i
ever
repay
you
pinsent
for
your
extreme
kindness
to
me
easily
let
me
be
present
when
you
open
the
coffin
of
ptahmes
what
ah
said
i
i
forgot
i
then
told
him
of
my
experiment
with
the
sarcophagus
and
the
perfume
he
listened
with
the
most
passionate
attention
finally
he
said
you
are
not
certain
the
sarcophagus
does
contain
the
body
though
not
certain
sir
robert
yet
you
told
me
if
i
remember
aright
that
that----
you
were
dying
i
interrupted
i
had
to
arouse
you
but
after
all
i
feel
sure
your
desire
will
be
gratified
i
have
no
sort
of
doubt
but
that
a
body
lies
in
the
coffin
nor
i
said
he
the
papyrus
speaks
of
an
essential
oil
the
mere
scent
of
which
arrests
decay
ptahmes
alone
knew
the
secret
of
its
preparation
but
the
sarcophagus
must
be
guarded
pinsent
i'll
fix
a
watch
i
said
and
held
out
my
hand
good-bye
sir
you
are
returning
to
your
camp
yes
then
au
revoir
pinsent
i
shall
send
for
you
as
soon
as
i
am
well
enough
to
investigate
the
coffin
thank
you
but
he
continued
to
hold
my
hand
and
looked
me
in
the
eyes
earnestly
be
careful
of
yourself
he
murmured
careful
i
repeated
puzzled
ay
he
murmured
still
lower
you
have
incurred
the
curse
unwittingly--but
still
you
have
incurred
it
what
curse
the
curse
which
ptahmes
directed
against
all
desecrators
of
his
tomb
i
thought
he
raved
and
felt
his
pulse
but
it
was
steady
as
a
rock
come
come
i
said
with
a
smile
i
shall
be
thinking
you
a
superstitious
man
sir
robert
presently
do
you
believe
in
god
he
asked
yes
i
cried
astounded
then
are
you
not
superstitious
too
but
there
i
have
warned
you
i'll
say
no
more
good-bye
kindly
send
my
daughter
to
me
i
found
miss
ottley
and
the
two
englishmen
at
the
door
of
the
outer
tent
sir
robert
wants
you
miss
ottley
i
observed
and
passed
on
i
had
hardly
gone
a
dozen
yards
however
when
i
found
i
had
a
companion
on
either
side
of
me
dr
belleville
immediately
opened
fire
you
have
been
taking
time
by
the
forelock
dr
pinsent
he
said
softly
i
should
hardly
have
moved
the
patient
for
a
day
or
two
he
is
very
weak
my
name
is
frankfort
weldon--captain
weldon
said
the
handsome
soldier--introducing
himself
i
think
you
have
annoyed
miss
ottley
dr
pinsent
seems
to
me
you
should
have
consulted
her
before
acting
at
least
i
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
and
shrugged
my
shoulders
the
thing
is
done
said
i
gentlemen
good-day
my
long
legs
left
them
quickly
in
the
rear
there
seemed
no
good
reason
to
waste
time
in
explaining
myself
to
them
they
would
soon
enough
find
out
the
reasonableness
of
my
actions
for
themselves
if
possessed
of
ordinary
human
curiosity
but
a
second
later
i
stopped
and
turned
dr
belleville
i
shouted
i
shall
fix
a
watch
at
the
temple
ottley
wishes
it
maintained
miss
ottley
will
tell
you
why
i
found
the
fellaheen
collected
in
a
group
near
the
old
store
house
they
eyed
me
approaching
with
open
sullenness
i
chose
two
among
their
number
and
directed
them
to
stand
guard
before
the
pylon
for
four
hours
the
two
i
had
picked
moved
off
obediently
enough
but
they
were
stopped
almost
on
instant
by
their
leader
a
big
ruffian
with
a
scarred
black
face
and
wild
fiercely
scowling
eyes
sir
robert
ottley's
dragoman
hurried
to
my
side
softly
excellency
or
there
will
be
trouble
he
muttered
let
me
speak
to
them
yazouk
is
a
chief--he
will
not
be
commanded
his
term
of
service
does
not
start
till
to-morrow
he
is
angry
silence
you
i
responded
in
the
same
tone
there
is
but
one
way
to
crush
a
nigger
mutiny
i
stepped
smilingly
forward
looking
into
yazouk's
eyes
the
black
giant--he
stood
six
feet
four
in
his
bare
feet
and
was
a
splendid
physical
specimen--put
his
hand
on
the
knife
in
his
belt
but
before
he
could
guess
at
my
intention
he
was
sprawling
on
the
sand
he
uttered
the
yell
of
an
angry
wild
beast
and
springing
up
rushed
at
me
with
bare
blade
i
stepped
aside
and
kicked
him
in
the
stomach
he
collapsed
howling
dismally
i
marched
up
to
the
rest
who
were
all
handling
their
knives
and
showed
them
my
revolver
two
minutes
later
they
were
all
disarmed
and
i
was
a
walking
arsenal
i
turned
to
the
dragoman
i
am
going
away
mehemet--to
my
own
camp
but
so
that
you
will
have
no
trouble
with
this
scum
i
shall
take
their
chief
with
me
i
need
a
servant
mehemet
bowed
to
the
very
ground
your
excellency
knows
best
he
muttered
reverently
yazouk
said
i
yonder
is
my
ass
go
saddle
him
for
me
yazouk
went
he
returned
with
the
ass
saddled
and
bridled
before
i
was
half
through
a
cigarette
i
mounted
forthwith
and
started
towards
my
long-deserted
camp
come
yazouk
i
called
out
carelessly
and
i
took
good
care
not
to
look
back
there
is
no
means
surer
of
making
an
african
obey
you
than
to
act
as
if
you
are
certain
he
has
no
alternative
perhaps
yazouk
hesitated
for
a
moment
torn
with
fear
and
hate
but
he
followed
me
soon
i
heard
the
patter
of
his
footsteps
on
the
sand
then
i
said
to
myself
now
if
this
man
is
to
remain
with
me
and
be
my
servant
i
must
make
him
fear
me
as
he
would
the
plague
but
how
i
solved
the
riddle
at
the
end
of
five
miles
i
must
show
him
that
i
despised
him
utterly
so
i
stopped
he
stopped
twenty
paces
separated
us
yazouk
i
said
come
here
he
approached
eyeing
me
like
a
wolf
from
this
day
for
a
month
yazouk
you
shall
be
my
slave
i
observed
calmly
if
you
prove
a
good
slave
i
shall
pay
you
when
the
term
ends
at
the
rate
of
fifty
piasters
a
day
if
you
offend
me
by
so
much
as
winking
an
eyelash
i
shall
not
only
pay
you
nothing
but
i
shall
ask
poseidon
to
transform
you
into
a
hyena
will
you
like
that
yazouk
did
not
remark
on
my
dreadful
threat
but
there
was
murder
in
his
eyes
i
smiled
at
him
and
always
looking
him
full
in
the
face
i
took
one
by
one
the
knives
i
had
taken
from
his
fellows
from
my
belt
and
cast
them
on
the
sand
at
his
feet
it
is
not
fit
for
a
lord
to
carry
such
trash
when
he
has
a
slave
i
said
pick
up
those
knives
yazouk
obeyed
me
when
he
stood
upright
again
there
was
a
great
doubt
in
his
eyes
i
thought
to
myself
it
would
be
quite
easy
for
this
ruffian
to
murder
me
at
any
time
in
my
sleep
and
already
i
am
a
wreck
for
want
of
sleep
i
threw
my
revolver
on
the
sand
carry
that
too
i
commanded
loftily--and
spurred
my
ass
on
probably
a
volume
might
be
written
on
the
state
of
yazouk's
mind
as
he
trudged
along
behind
me
to
my
camp--a
whole
compendium
of
psychology
but
i
cannot
write
it
because
i
never
once
glanced
at
him
and
therefore
i
can
only
guess
at
the
turmoil
of
his
thoughts
but
the
event
justified
my
expectations
i
was
so
mortally
wearied
when
i
reached
my
camp
that
i
had
no
heart
left
even
to
discover
whether
my
precious
manuscripts
had
been
disturbed
by
some
chance
wayfarer
of
the
wilderness
it
sufficed
me
that
my
tent
was
standing
and
that
it
contained
a
cot
i
cast
myself
down
without
even
troubling
to
remove
my
boots
and
i
slept
like
the
dead
for
sixteen
solid
hours
when
i
awoke
it
was
high
noon
a
steaming
bowl
of
coffee
stood
upon
my
table
and
a
mess
of
baked
rice
and
fish
beside
the
plate
lay
my
revolver
and
every
one
of
the
knives
i
had
given
yazouk
to
carry
yazouk
himself
stood
at
the
flap
of
the
tent
a
monstrous
stolid
sentinel
when
i
arose
he
bent
almost
double
i
swept
the
armoury
into
a
drawer
and
attacked
my
breakfast
with
the
relish
of
a
famished
man
then
i
set
to
work
with
the
energy
of
a
giant
refreshed
and
with
short
intervals
for
meals
sleep
and
exercise
i
toiled
at
my
book
thereafter
till
it
was
roughly
finished
so
twenty
days
sped
by
throughout
yazouk
waited
upon
me
like
the
slave
of
aladdin's
lamp
i
had
not
a
fault
to
find
with
him
indeed
he
was
a
perfect
jewel
of
a
servant
and
he
stood
in
such
abject
terror
of
my
every
movement
nod
or
smile
or
frown
that
i
could
have
wished
to
retain
his
services
for
ever
but
that
was
not
to
be
on
the
twenty-first
morning
he
accidentally
dropped
a
cup
and
broke
it
i
heard
the
smash
and
looked
up
it
was
to
see
yazouk
flying
like
a
panic-stricken
deer
into
the
desert
i
shouted
to
recall
him
but
he
only
sped
the
faster
chapter
vii
the
one
goddess
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
covering
up
the
stele
i
had
unearthed
with
sand
there
was
no
use
thinking
of
attempting
to
transport
it
to
cairo
under
existing
circumstances
but
i
had
no
mind
to
be
deprived
of
the
credit
attached
to
its
discovery
so
i
hid
it
well
afterwards
i
gathered
up
my
portable
possessions
including
my
tent
and
packed
them
in
a
load
for
my
ass's
back
ready
for
the
morrow
for
i
had
resolved
to
set
out
on
the
morrow
for
the
hill
of
rakh
surely
i
thought
ottley
will
be
quite
recovered
by
this
i
wondered
why
he
had
not
sent
for
me
before--in
accordance
with
his
pledge
had
he
forgotten
it
the
desert
was
exceptionally
still
that
evening
there
was
a
new
moon
and
although
it
gave
but
little
light
it
seemed
to
have
chained
the
denizens
of
the
wilderness
to
cover
i
lay
upon
the
sand
gazing
up
at
the
stars
and
listening
in
vain
for
sounds
for
hours
then
at
length
i
fell
into
a
quiet
doze
the
howling
of
a
jackal
awakened
me
it
was
very
far
off
therefore
i
must
have
slept
lightly
a
long
sleep
for
the
moon
had
disappeared
the
darkness
that
lay
upon
the
land
was
like
the
impenetrable
gloom
of
a
rayless
cave
but
the
heavens
were
spangled
with
twinkling
eyes
that
beamed
upon
me
very
friendly
wise
i
had
lost
all
desire
to
repose
but
i
had
found
a
craving
for
a
pipe
i
took
out
my
old
briar-wood
therefore
charged
it
to
the
brim
and
struck
a
match
my
god
i
gasped
and
scrambled
afoot
the
tall
arab
who
had
terrified
miss
ottley
in
the
cave
temple
at
rakh
stood
about
three
paces
off
intently
regarding
me
i
struck
a
second
match
before
the
first
had
burned
out
then
felt
for
my
revolver
tell
me
what
it
is
you
want
i
cried
in
arabic
and
quickly
or
i
fire
he
did
not
speak
but
very
slowly
he
moved
towards
me
i
raised
the
pistol
stop
i
said
he
did
not
stop
then
have
it
i
cried
and
pulled
the
trigger
he
did
not
flinch
from
the
blistering
flash
of
the
discharge
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
should
have
seared
his
face
and
that
the
bullet
should
have
split
his
skull
i
had
a
momentary
glimpse
of
a
ghastly
brownish-yellow
visage
and
of
two
dull
widely
separated
eyes
peering
into
mine
then
all
was
dark
again
and
i
was
struggling
as
never
i
had
struggled
in
my
life
before
long
stiff
fingers
clutched
my
throat
a
rigid
wood-like
form
was
pressed
against
my
own
and
my
nostrils
were
filled
with
a
sickly
penetrating
odour
which
i
all
too
sharply
recognised
it
was
the
perfume
that
had
issued
from
the
sarcophagus
of
ptahmes
when
i
drove
my
chisel
through
the
lead
at
first
i
grasped
nothing
but
air
but
clutching
wildly
at
the
things
that
gripped
my
throat
i
caught
hands
at
last
composed
of
bone
there
was
no
flesh
on
them
or
so
it
seemed
to
me
yet
it
was
good
to
grip
something
it
gave
me
heart
i
had
a
horrible
feeling
for
some
awful
seconds
of
contending
with
the
supernatural
but
those
hands
were
hard
and
firm
they
compressed
my
windpipe
back
and
fro
we
writhed
i
heard
nothing
but
my
own
hard
breathing
i
was
being
slowly
strangled
it
was
very
hard
to
drag
those
hands
apart
but
i
am
strong
stronger
than
many
men
who
earn
their
living
by
exhibiting
to
the
vulgar
feats
of
strength
impelled
by
fear
of
death
i
exerted
my
reserve
of
force
and
driving
will
and
muscle
into
one
supreme
united
effort
i
tore
the
death
grip
from
my
neck
and
flung
the
arab
off
uttering
a
sobbing
howl
of
relief
and
rage
i
followed
him
and
caught
him
by
the
middle
then
stooping
low
i
heaved
him
high
and
dashed
him
to
the
ground
there
came
a
sound
of
snapping
wood
or
bones
but
neither
sigh
nor
cry
of
any
sort
we'll
see
i
growled
and
struck
a
match
the
sand
before
me
was
dinted
but
deserted
the
arab
had
vanished
my
senses
rocked
in
horrified
astonishment
my
flesh
crept
a
cold
chill
of
vague
unreasoning
terror
caught
me
i
listened
all
my
nerves
taut
strained
peering
wildly
round
into
the
dark
but
the
silence
was
unbroken
nothing
was
to
be
heard
nothing
was
to
be
seen
were
it
not
for
the
dinted
sand
and
the
marks
of
feet
other
than
my
own
where
we
had
stepped
and
struggled
i
could
have
come
to
the
conclusion
i
had
dreamed
after
a
while
spent
in
soothing
panic
fears
i
sneaked
off
to
my
baggage
and
extracted
from
the
pile
a
candle
lamp
this
i
lighted
and
returning
searched
the
sands
on
hands
and
knees
the
stranger's
footprints
were
longer
than
my
own
and
they
were
toe-marked
plainly
then
he
had
stolen
on
me
naked-footed
looking
wide
around
the
dint
made
by
his
falling
body
i
came
presently
upon
some
more
of
them
they
were
each
a
yard
apart
and
led
towards
the
hill
of
rakh
yet
only
for
a
little
while
soon
they
grew
fainter
and
fainter
finally
they
disappeared
tortured
by
the
mystery
of
it
all
i
halted
where
the
footprints
vanished
and
putting
out
the
lamp
squatted
on
the
ground
to
wait
for
dawn
it
came
an
hour
later
but
it
told
me
nothing
fresh
indeed
it
only
rendered
the
riddle
more
intolerably
maddening
where
had
my
arab
gone
and
how
had
he
come
for
there
was
not
a
single
footprint
leading
to
the
camp
of
course
he
might
have
thrown
a
cloak
before
him
on
which
to
walk
and
thus
he
might
have
progressed
and
left
no
trace
but
wherefore
such
extraordinary
caution
and
why
should
he
be
so
anxious
to
conceal
himself
it
was
hard
to
give
up
the
riddle
but
easier
to
abandon
than
to
solve
it
calling
philosophy
to
my
aid
and
imagination
i
determined
that
my
arab
was
some
mad
hermit
upon
whose
solitude
ottley
had
intruded
in
the
first
instance
and
i
in
the
second
and
that
he
had
conceived
a
particular
animosity
for
some
unknown
reason
against
my
humble
self
and
wished
to
kill
me
without
a
doubt
he
had
some
secret
hiding-place
and
feared
lest
i
should
seek
to
discover
it
perhaps
he
had
found
some
treasure
of
which
he
had
constituted
himself
the
jealous
guardian
i
felt
sure
at
any
rate
that
he
was
mad
his
actions
had
always
been
so
peculiar
and
his
speechlessness
so
baffling
and
astonishing
and
crassly
unreasonable
but
he
or
someone
had
killed
my
donkey
i
found
the
poor
beast
lying
in
a
hollow
dead
as
cã¦sar
a
knife
had
been
employed
a
long
sharp-pointed
knife--perhaps
a
sword
it
had
searched
out
the
creature's
heart
and
pierced
it
i
made
a
hasty
autopsy
in
order
to
be
sure
the
circumstance
was
most
exasperating
it
condemned
me
to
the
task
of
being
my
own
beast
of
burthen
and
the
load
was
not
a
light
one
i
made
however
the
best
of
a
bad
job
and
having
fortified
myself
with
a
good
breakfast
i
started
off
laden
like
a
pack-horse
for
the
hill
of
rakh
having
covered
four
miles
i
stopped
miss
ottley
and
captain
frankfort
weldon
had
suddenly
come
into
view
they
were
mounted
i
sat
down
on
my
baggage
lighted
a
cigarette
and
waited
common
elementary
christian
charity
would
compel
them
to
offer
me
a
lift
it
was
a
good
thought
it
is
not
right
that
a
man
should
work
like
a
beast
and
besides
it
was
cheering
to
see
miss
ottley
again
she
came
up
looking
rather
care-worn
and
a
good
deal
surprised
i
arose
and
doffed
my
hat
like
a
courtier
captain
weldon
touched
his
helmet
with
his
whip
by
way
of
salute
he
might
have
just
stepped
out
of
a
bandbox
i
felt
he
did
not
like
me
the
girl
looked
at
me
with
level
brows
sir
robert
well
and
strong
again
i
asked
quite
said
miss
ottley
we
were
on
our
way
to
pay
you
a
visit
observed
the
captain
sir
robert
wants
me
i
hazarded
miss
ottley
shrugged
her
shoulders
does
he
she
asked
then
added
with
a
tinge
of
irony
you
seem
content
to
be
one
of
those
who
are
always
neglected
until
a
need
arises
for
their
services
does
it
appear
impossible
that
we
might
have
contemplated
a
friendly
call
i
have
no
parlour
tricks
i
explained
her
lip
curled
you
need
not
tell
me
you
left
without
troubling
to
bid
me
as
much
as
a
good-day
how
long
ago
three
weeks
why
her
tone
was
really
imperious
but
i
left
a
benediction
on
the
doorstep
i
responded
you
looked
cross
and
i
was
in
a
hurry
her
eyes
blazed
they
were
beautiful
to
see
where
are
you
going
she
demanded
to
call
on
your
father
you
have
a
load
observed
the
captain
a
mere
nothing
is
not
that
a
tent
i
am
shifting
camp
that
nigger
chap--yazouk--came
along
last
evening
but
he
vanished
during
the
night
we
fancied
something
might
have
happened
oh
yazouk
he
broke
a
cup
and
feared
i
would
turn
him
into
a
hyena
so
he
ran
away
what
shouted
the
captain
a
superstitious
creature
i
shrugged
the
captain
shook
with
laughter
we
wondered
how
you
had
tamed
him
he
chuckled
presently--after
the
bout
'pon
honour
you
served
him
very
prettily
straight
from
the
shoulder
and
savate
too
the
dragoman
declares
you
have
the
evil
eye
have
you
lost
your
donkey
dr
pinsent
demanded
miss
ottley
he
expired
suddenly
last
evening
captain
weldon
frowned
and
sat
up
very
straight
in
his
saddle
eh
he
said
and
looked
a
question
i
had
an
arab
visitor
my
visitor
or
another
killed
my
donkey
with
a
knife
i
should
like
to
have
caught
him
in
the
act
my
dream
said
miss
ottley
and
caught
her
breath
by
jove
said
the
captain
it
is
really
wonderful--but
wait--you
had
a
visitor
doctor
i
believe
it
did
he
offer
to
attack
you
the
spirit
of
the
cavern
cried
the
girl
a
lunatic
of
an
arab
i
retorted
and
so
little
of
a
spirit
that
i
had
hard
work
to
prevent
him
throttling
me
but
the
face
did
you
see
the
face
our
friend
of
the
cavern
i
admitted
miss
ottley
glanced
at
the
captain
then
back
at
me
she
was
as
white
as
a
lily
i
knew
it
she
said
i
saw
him
kill
the
donkey
and
steal
upon
you--in
a
dream
his
hands
were
bloody--and
look
there
is
blood
still
on
your
throat
my
cask
was
empty
so
perforce
i
could
not
wash
i
murmured
the
captain
looked
thunderstruck
it's
the
most
wonderful
thing
he
kept
repeating
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
the
world
and
i
never
thought
of
looking
in
the
mirror
it
was
packed
up
i
went
on
i
took
out
a
rather
grimy
kerchief
and
began
to
rub
at
my
neck
has
that
wretched
arab--worried
you
at
all--since
i
left
miss
ottley
i
have
seen
him
twice--and
once
more
she
shuddered
in
my
dream
and
where
did
you
see
him
out
of
dreams
once
in
the
cavern
and
once
in
my
father's
tent
each
time
at
night
each
time
he
vanished
like
a
shadow
did
anyone
else
see
him
my
father
and
captain
weldon
the
most
hideous
brute
i
ever
saw
commented
the
captain
you
could
put
a
good-sized
head
between
his
eyes
and
such
eyes
dull
as
mud
but
horribly
intelligent
well
well
said
i
we'll
know
more
about
him
some
day
soon
perhaps
that
is
if
we
stay
long
enough
at
the
hill
of
rakh
he
has
a
hiding
thereabouts--without
a
doubt
your
father
is
pining
to
open
the
tomb
of
ptahmes
i
suppose
miss
ottley
he
has
opened
it
she
answered
oh
i
exclaimed--and
stopped
dead
in
the
act
of
naming
sir
robert
a
thankless
perjurer
the
girl
was
looking
at
me
hard
you
are
surprised
curious
i
growled
it
was
hard
to
say
for
i
was
furious
i
cannot
enlighten
your
curiosity
she
said
no
he
permitted
no
one
to
be
present
to
assist
him
it
took
place
the
day
before
yesterday
in
the
cave
temple
and
the
tomb
is
now
closed
again
you
are
then
unaware
what
is
discovered
perfectly
and
sir
robert
you
will
find
my
father
greatly
changed
dr
pinsent
indeed
he
seems
to
be
quite
strong
but
he
has
aged
notably
and
he
will
hardly
condescend
to
converse
with
anyone
even
me
moreover
the
subject
of
ptahmes
is
tabooed
the
very
name
enrages
him
dr
belleville
has
forbidden
it
to
be
mentioned
in
his
hearing
humph
said
i
if
my
donkey
were
alive
i
should
go
to
kwansu
straight
but
as
it
is
i
shall
have
to
trespass
for
a
stretch
on
your
preserves
at
rakh
i
hate
it
too
for
your
father
has
broken
faith
with
me
ah
cried
the
girl
he
promised
that
you
should
help
him
open
the
tomb
exactly
you
must
not
be
hard
on
him
i
believe
that
he
is
not
quite
himself
oh
i
am
accustomed
to
that
sort
of
treatment
from
the
ottleys
i
replied
it
was
brutal
beyond
question
but
i
was
past
reckoning
on
niceties
with
rage
captain
weldon
turned
scarlet
and
raised
his
whip
dr
pinsent
he
cried
you
forget
yourself
for
two
pins----
then
he
stopped--having
met
my
eyes
i
laughed
in
his
face
why
not
i
queried
jibingly
it
would
be
not
only
chivalrous--a
lady
looking
on--but
safe
have
you
ever
seen
a
st
bernard
hurt
a
spaniel
he
went
deathly
and
slashed
me
with
his
whip
poor
boy
i
never
blamed
him
i'd
have
done
the
same
myself
as
for
me
the
blow
descended
and
cooled
my
beastly
temper
which
was
an
unmitigated
blessing
i
took
his
whip
away
and
gave
it
back
to
him
then
i
laughed
out
tickled
at
the
humour
of
the
situation
though
it
only
told
against
myself
i
had
intended
accepting
your
offer
of
your
mule
for
my
belongings
i
chuckled
you
haven't
offered
him
but
that's
a
detail
and
now
i
can't
i
shook
with
laughter
weldon
leaped
on
instant
to
the
ground
do
do
he
almost
groaned
he
was
a
generous
youngster
and
forgive
me
he
said
if
you
can--it
was
a
coward
blow
gladly
i'll
forgive
you
i
replied
and
we
clasped
hands
i'll
help
you
load
the
beast
said
he
but
i
put
my
foot
on
my
baggage
that
mule
i
said
belongs
to
sir
robert
ottley
i'll
not
risk
the
breaking
of
his
back
we
looked
at
one
another
and
i
saw
the
captain
understood
me
he
turned
rather
sheepishly
away
but
did
not
mount
immediately
miss
ottley
was
gazing
over
the
desert
you
must
know
you
are
behaving
like
a
child
she
cuttingly
remarked
i
shook
my
head
at
the
captain
that
means
you
are
keeping
a
lady
waiting
i
observed
he
smiled
wrily
in
spite
of
himself
scottish
are
you
not
he
asked
from
aberdeen
he
climbed
on
the
mule's
back
i'm
thinking
dr
pinsent
would
like
to
be
alone
he
said
miss
ottley
nodded
and
they
rode
off
together
i
picked
up
my
swag
and
trudged
after
them
it
was
dry
work
about
twenty
minutes
later
miss
ottley
rode
back
alone
she
did
not
beat
about
the
bush
at
all
i
want
you
to
put
your
things
on
my
donkey
she
said
and
slipping
afoot
she
stood
in
my
path
not
to-day
said
i
but
i'm
in
trouble
i
need
your
help
she
muttered
with
such
a
cavalier
as
frankfort
weldon
i
inquired
she
coloured
and
dr
belleville
old
friends
both
i
am
led
to
fancy
she
bit
her
lips
and
both
of
them
in
love
with
you
i
went
on
bluntly
dr
pinsent
said
miss
ottley
it
is
my
opinion
that
my
father
is
not
quite
right
in
his
mind
dr
belleville
is
a
f
r
c
s
said
i
i
am
afraid
of
him--my
own
father
she
said
in
a
tragic
tone
i
have
a
feeling
that
he
hates
me
that
he
wants
to--to
destroy
me
captain
weldon
would
lay
down
his
life
for
you
i
think
said
i
she
put
a
hand
on
my
breast
and
looked
me
straight
in
the
eye
i
could
not
tell
this
to
dr
belleville
nor
to
the
other
she
half
whispered
i
thrilled
all
over
all
right
i
said
cheerily
just
stand
aside
till
i
load
your
little
beastie
will
you
her
whole
face
lighted
up
ah
i
knew
you
would
not
desert
me
she
said
but
we
did
not
speak
again
all
the
way
to
the
hill
of
rakh
we
were
too
busy
thinking
the
two
of
us
when
we
arrived
she
flitted
off
still
silent
captain
weldon
came
to
me
i
want
you
to
share
my
tent
said
he
i
have
a
tub
for
you
in
waiting
and
some
fresh
linen
laid
out
if
you'll
honour
me
by
wearing
it
you
are
a
brick
i
replied
and
took
his
arm
but
at
the
door
of
the
biggest
tent
in
the
whole
camp
to
which
he
brought
me
i
paused
in
wonder
it
was
a
sort
of
lady's
bower
within
the
floor
was
laid
with
rugs
and
the
sloped
canvas
walls
were
hung
with
silken
frills
and
women's
photographs
littered
the
fold-up
dressing-table
they
were
all
of
the
same
face
though
those
latter
the
face
of
miss
ottley
sybarite
i
cried
he
winced
then
squared
his
shoulders
well--perhaps
so
he
said
with
a
smile
but
your
gallery
has
only
one
goddess
i
commented
pointing
to
a
picture
he
gave
a
shame-faced
little
laugh
you
see
doctor
i
have
the
happiness
to
be
engaged
to
marry
miss
ottley
he
explained
then
he
left
me
to
my
tub
chapter
viii
ottley
shows
his
hand
the
captain's
linen
he
had
laid
out
for
my
use
on
his
damask-covered
cot
was
composed
of
the
very
finest
silk
even
the
socks
were
silk
i
was
positively
ashamed
to
draw
my
stained
and
work-worn
outer
garments
over
them
and
i
thought
with
a
sigh
of
my
two
decent
suits
of
tweed
lying
like
the
dutchman's
anchor
far
away--in
a
cairo
lodging-house
to
be
precise
i
shaved
with
the
captain's
razor
and
wondered
why
i
did
not
in
the
least
mind
resting
indebted
to
his
courtesy
the
removal
of
my
beard
laid
bare
the
weal
the
captain's
whip
had
raised
perhaps
that
was
the
reason
he
came
in
just
as
i
had
finished
and
he
saw
the
weal
on
instant
i
wish
to
the
lord
you'd
just
blacken
one
of
my
eyes
he
said
remorsefully
the
sight
of
that
makes
me
feel
an
out-and-out
cad
not
ten
minutes
before
it
happened
miss
ottley
had
been
telling
me
the
angel
of
goodness
you
had
been
to
her
i
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
cot
and
grinned
it
gives
me
quite
a
distinguished
appearance
i
replied
and
say
didn't
it
give
me
back
my
temper
nicely
too
little
wonder
you
were
wild
said
he
but
why
didn't
you
break
me
up
while
you
were
about
it
you
could
have
easily
enough
lord
how
big
and
strong
you
are
and
ugly
i
supplemented
he
flushed
all
over
his
face
you
make
me
feel
a
silly
girl-man
by
comparison
he
cried
a
man
ought
to
be
ugly
and
strong-looking
like
you
i'd
give
half
my
fortune
to
possess
that
jaw
what
a
boy
it
is
i
said
delightedly
for
i
was
proud
of
my
jaw
and
i
love
flattery
i'm
having
a
cot
made
now
it
will
be
put
over
there
for
you
you'll
share
my
diggings
won't
you
i
want
us
to
be
friends
beamed
the
captain
there
was
something
so
ingenuous
and
charming
in
his
frankness
that
i
assented
at
once
it's
funny
he
said
afterwards
but
i
detested
you
at
first
have
a
cigar
this
box
of
cabanas
is
for
you
they're
prime
i've
more
in
my
kit
when
they
are
finished
lie
down
and
rest
while
you
smoke
one
won't
you
lunch
won't
be
ready
for
an
hour
yet
and
you
must
be
fagged
i
wasn't
a
bit
but
i
lay
back
and
puffed
a
mouthful
of
delicious
smoke
with
a
long-drawn
sigh
of
luxury
you
needn't
talk
miss
ottley
says
you
don't
like
talking
said
the
captain
he
lit
a
cigar
and
sat
down
on
his
kit
box
i'm
a
real
gabbler
though
he
confessed
do
you
mind
no
fire
away
sonny
he
fired
it
was
all
about
himself
and
miss
ottley
how
they
had
been
brought
up
together
predestined
sweethearts
how
they
had
quarrelled
and
made
up
and
quarrelled
again
how
really
and
truly
in
their
hearts
they
adored
each
other
and
how--if
it
had
not
been
for
the
girl's
intense
devotion
for
her
father
they
would
have
been
married
long
ago
he
characterised
sir
robert
as
an
extremely
selfish
man
who
ever
since
his
wife's
death
had
used
his
daughter
as
a
servant
and
secretary
because
he
could
get
no
other
to
serve
him
as
well
and
intelligently
but
he
doesn't
really
care
for
her
a
straw
concluded
the
captain
and
he
would
sacrifice
her
without
remorse
to
his
beastly
mummy
hobby
for
ever
if
i'd
let
him
but
i
won't
i'm
going
to
put
my
foot
down
presently
i've
waited
long
enough
he
has
done
nothing
but
drag
her
all
over
europe
translating
papyri
for
him
for
the
last
six
years
and
she
has
worked
for
him
like
a
slave
it's
high
time
she
had
a
little
peace
and
happiness
translating
papyri
i
repeated
a
scholar
then
between
ourselves
replied
the
captain
sir
robert's
fame
as
a
scholar
and
an
egyptologist
rests
entirely
upon
his
daughter's
labours
without
her
he
would
be
unknown
she
did
all
the
real
work
he
reaped
the
credit
she
is
three
times
the
scholar
he
is
and
i
know
a
frenchman
who
regards
her
knowledge
of
cuneiform
as
simply
marvellous
he
is
a
professor
of
ancient
languages
too
at
the
sorbonne
so
he
ought
to
know
queer
she
never
mentioned
a
word
of
it
to
me
said
i
oh
cried
the
captain
she
is
the
modestest
sweetest
creature
in
the
universe
i
sometimes
think
she
is
positively
ashamed
of
her
extraordinary
ability
whenever
i
speak
of
it
she
apologises--and
says
she
only
learned
the
things
she
knows
to
be
a
help
to
her
dear
old
father
dear
old
father
indeed
the
selfish
old
swine
ought
to
be
suppressed
he
loathes
me
because
he
fears
i'll
persuade
her
to
leave
him
if
she
wasn't
so
useful
she
could
go
to
the
deuce
for
all
he'd
care
but
it's
got
to
end
soon
or
i'll
know
the
reason
why
don't
you
think
i'm
right
we've
been
engaged
now
seven
years
i
consider
you
a
model
of
patience
i
replied
besides
said
the
captain
starting
off
on
a
new
tack
the
old
man
is
positively
uncanny
it's
my
belief
he
has
an
underhanded
motive
in
his
love
for
mummies
especially
for
his
latest
find
this
ptahmes
he's
a
spook-hunter
you
know--and
he
told
me
one
day
in
an
unguarded
moment
that
he
expected
to
live
a
thousand
years
what's
a
spook-hunter
captain
oh
i
mean
a
spiritualist
he
has
a
medium
chap
he
keeps
in
london--a
rascally
beggar
who
bleeds
thousands
a
year
out
of
him
they
have
sã©ances
the
medium
scamp
pretends
to
go
into
a
trance
and
tells
him
all
sorts
of
rubbish
about
the
nile
kings
and
prophets
and
wizards
and
magicians
and
the
elixir
of
life
it
is
dashed
unpleasant
for
me
i
can
tell
you
there's
always
some
wild
yarn
going
round
the
clubs
and
as
i'm
known
to
be
ottley's
prospective
son-in-law
i
have
the
life
chaffed
out
of
me
in
consequence
the
latest
was
that
the
medium
chap--oscar
neitenstein
is
his
name--put
ottley
in
the
way
of
finding
an
old
theban
prophet's
tomb--this
very
ptahmes
don't
you
know
and
though
he
has
been
underground
4000
years
neitenstein
has
fooled
ottley
into
expecting
to
find
the
prophet
still
alive
it's
too
idiotic
to
speak
seriously
about
of
course
but
on
my
honour
the
yarn
drove
me
out
of
england
it
got
into
the
comic
papers
ugh
you
know
what
that
means
but
i'm
not
sorry
in
one
way
so
i've
come
here
to
have
it
out
with
ottley
and
i'm
going
to--by
gad
you
haven't
spoken
to
him
yet
i
have
but
he
treated
me
like
a
kid
told
me
to
run
away
and
play
and
allow
serious
people
to
work
i
stormed
a
bit
but
it
was
no
use
it
made
him
so
angry
that
he
nearly
took
a
fit--and
i
had
to
leave
since
then
he
has
been
shut
up
with
his
infernal
mummy
in
that
cave
temple
over
there--and
he
won't
even
let
his
daughter
go
within
yards
of
the
door
that's
curious
isn't
it
very
and
there's
that
business
about
the
mysterious
arab
went
on
the
captain
the
ugly
horror
that
tried
to
throttle
you
and
has
been
frightening
miss
ottley
she
thinks
it's
a
ghost
but
i
reckon
not
ah
i
reckon
sir
robert
knows
all
about
that
arab
though
he
pretends
he
does
not
know
in
my
opinion
it's
another
of
those
spook
mediums
of
his
and
he
is
keeping
the
ugly
beast
hidden
away
somewhere
probably
the
fellow
is
some
awful
criminal
who
has
got
to
hide
sir
robert
would
shelter
hill
or
even
that
australian
wife-murderer
deeming
if
he
said
he
was
a
medium
you
extend
my
mental
horizon
i
remarked
the
arab
mystery
is
clearing
up
the
captain
simply
beamed
so
glad
you
catch
on
he
said
do
you
know
i
am
depending
heaps
upon
you
in
this
business
how
the
monosyllable
disconcerted
the
captain
he
stuttered
and
hawed
for
a
while
but
finally
he
blurted
out
well
you
see
she
won't
leave
her
father
under
existing
circumstances
on
any
account
that's
the
trouble
but
i'm
hoping
if
we
can
convince
the
old
man
he
is
being
fooled
by
a
pack
of
scoundrels
he
will
return
to
his
sober
senses
and
live
sensibly
and
then----
he
paused
and
then--wedding
bells
i
suggested
exactly
replied
the
captain
and
see
here
i
have
a
plan
ah
it's
to
lay
for
that
arab
as
a
first
step--and
catch
the
brute
and
what
then
the
captain
looked
rather
foolish
well
he
said
well--oh--we'd
be
guided
by
circumstances
then
of
course
we
might
induce
him
to
confess--don't
you
think
i
could
not
help
laughing
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
i
said
it
is
that
you
are
in
the
position
of
a
man
who
knows
what
he
wants
but
does
not
in
the
least
understand
how
to
get
it
still
count
on
my
help
if
we
can
lay
the
arab
by
the
heels
we
shall
not
harm
anyone
deserving
of
consideration
and
we
will
put
miss
ottley's
mind
at
rest
at
all
events
i
hate
to
think
that
she
is
worried
by
the
rascal
what
do
you
propose
i
thought
of
hiding
by
the
temple
to-night
i
passed
it
late
last
evening
and
though
sir
robert
was
ostensibly
alone
i
could
swear
i
heard
voices
what
do
you
say
certainly
shake
said
the
captain
we
shook
now
let's
go
to
lunch
said
he
we
went
that's
belleville's
shanty
observed
the
captain
pointing
to
a
neighbouring
tent
i
don't
like
the
fellow
do
you
i
don't
know
him
he's
a
spook-hunter
like
sir
robert
ah
the
beggar
is
in
love
with
miss
ottley
oh
he
had
the
impudence
to
tell
her
to
her
face
one
day
that
she
would
never
marry
me
he
declared
that
it
was
written--by
spooks
i
suppose
one
of
these
days
i'll
have
to
break
his
head
for
him
but
he
is
not
a
man
you
can
easily
quarrel
with
you
simply
can't
insult
him
he
comes
up
smiling
every
time
an
unpleasant
person
a
bounder
said
the
captain
with
intense
conviction
lord
how
hot
it
is
we
entered
the
eating
tent
as
he
spoke
the
table
was
already
laid
dr
belleville
stood
near
the
head
of
it
talking
to
miss
ottley
a
couple
of
soudanese
flitted
about
affecting
to
be
busy
but
effecting
very
little
at
sight
of
me
both
shuddered
back
against
the
canvas
and
stood
transfixed
one
held
a
spoon
the
other
a
plate
they
looked
extremely
absurd
i
told
them
in
arabic
that
only
the
dishonest
had
occasion
to
fear
the
evil
eye
and
took
a
seat
instantly
both
rushed
to
serve
me
my
companions
not
possessing
the
evil
eye
were
forced
to
wait
miss
ottley
became
satirical
but
i
was
hungry
and
her
shafts
glanced
off
the
armour
of
my
appetite
when
i
had
finished
my
first
helping
of
currie
she
sat
down
there's
no
use
waiting
for
father
she
sighed
i
shall
take
his
lunch
to
him
by-and-by
dr
belleville
echoed
the
sigh
my
dear
young
lady
said
he
permit
me
now
and
he
vanished
a
minute
later
carrying
a
tray
you
see
said
the
captain
sotto
voce
to
me
more
currie
i
said
addressing
not
the
captain
but
the
tent
immediately
one
of
the
soudanese
slipped
and
sprawled
on
the
floor
in
his
eagerness
to
serve
the
other
leaped
over
his
fellow's
prostrate
body
and
whisked
away
my
plate
he
returned
it
loaded
in
about
five
seconds
miss
ottley
broke
into
a
half-hysterical
laugh
it
kept
up
so
long
that
at
last
i
looked
at
her
in
surprise
she
had
a
knife
and
fork
before
her
but
nothing
else
also
the
captain
what
is
the
matter
i
demanded
look
she
gurgled
following
her
finger
i
turned
and
saw
both
soudanese
standing
like
statues
behind
me
wretches
i
cried
have
you
nothing
else
to
do
they
uttered
a
joint
howl
of
terror
and
fled
from
the
tent
but
the
joke
had
staled
i
took
after
them
hot
foot
caught
them
and
drove
them
back
to
work
to
find
that
my
companions
in
the
meanwhile
had
helped
themselves
dr
belleville
however
entered
a
moment
later
and
at
a
nod
from
me
the
trembling
soudanese
became
his
abject
slaves
dr
belleville
had
something
to
say
the
negroes
are
frightened
of
you
he
began
they
fancy
i
have
the
evil
eye
humph
cried
the
doctor
talk
german--they
understand
english
it's
not
that
what
then
sir
robert
ottley
sent
one
of
them
to
you--with
a
message--last
night
he
returned
this
morning
with
three
ribs
broken
he
is
lying
in
the
hospital
tent
now--in
a
high
fever
a
tall
thin
man--the
eyes
set
far
apart
in
the
skull
i
asked
dr
belleville
shook
his
head
no
short
thick-set
snub-featured
but
a
giant
in
strength
how
did
he
explain
his
accident
that
unwittingly
he
angered
you
the
man
is
a
liar
i
declared
indignantly
i
had
a
set-to
with
a
skulking
rogue
last
night
that
is
true
enough
but
the
fellow
i
encountered
and
threw
was
taller
than
myself
the
doctor
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
was
a
dark
night
i
believe
then
a
minute
later--ottley
is
much
annoyed
this
meeraschi
was
an
excellent
subject
ottley
was
experimenting
with
him
how
hypnotically
i
glanced
at
the
others
but
they
were
talking
apart
ottley
sent
me
a
message
i
asked
returning
to
the
doctor
yes
replied
belleville
between
mouthfuls
he
was
gulping
down
his
lunch
like
a
wolf
in
a
hurry
he
wants
you
he
went
on
needless
to
say
i
received
no
message
needless
repeated
belleville
and
you
here
the
tone
was
so
insulting
that
i
arose
and
walked
quietly
out
of
the
tent
the
sun
was
blazing
hot
i
thought
of
the
cool
cave
temple
and
wandered
towards
it
why
not
see
sir
robert
at
once
why
not
indeed
two
black
sentinels
guarded
the
middle
pylon
skulking
in
the
shadow
of
a
column
when
i
approached
they
stood
bolt
upright
they
were
armed
with
rifles
they
barred
the
way
ottley
i
shouted
ottley
and
once
again
ottley
at
the
third
the
little
baronet's
face
appeared
in
the
stone
doorway
oh
pinsent
he
said
and
stared
at
me
i
read
doubt
in
his
glance
some
fear
and
anger
and
uneasiness
but
there
was
much
else
i
could
not
read
his
skin
was
as
yellow
as
old
parchment
and
he
did
not
look
a
well
man
by
any
means
it
is
roasting--here
i
observed
he
swallowed
audibly
as
a
woman
does
recovering
from
tears
ah
well
he
said
come
in--here
the
blacks
vastly
relieved
it
appeared
lowered
their
arms
and
gave
me
passage
sir
robert
however
still
blocked
the
door
i
traversed
the
pylon
and
stood
before
him
we
can
talk
here
said
he
but
i
had
no
mind
to
be
treated
like
that
i
looked
him
in
the
face
and
talked
to
him
like
this
i
am
not
welcome
i
can
see
it
but
it
matters
nothing
to
me
i
have
rights
i
gave
you
back
your
life
you
made
me
a
promise
you
broke
your
promise
that
relieves
me
of
any
need
to
be
conventional
i
am
curious
i
intend
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
invite
me
into
the
cavern
and
show
me
what
you
have
there
to
be
seen
or
i
shall
put
you
aside
and
help
myself
i
can
do
so
your
blacks
do
not
frighten
me
armed
or
unarmed
as
for
you
pouf
now
choose
dr
pinsent
said
sir
robert
he
was
shaking
like
an
aspen
in
about
ten
minutes
my
dragoman
is
setting
out
for
cairo
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
bear
him
company
he
will
hand
you
at
the
end
of
the
journey
my
cheque
for
a
thousand
pounds
i
ought
to
have
told
you
i
murmured
that
it
is
a
point
of
honour
with
me
to
keep
my
word
two
thousand
said
sir
robert
at
all
costs
said
i
five
thousand
he
cried
you
rich
little
cad
i
growled
and
looked
into
the
muzzle
of
a
revolver
sir
robert's
eyes
seen
across
the
sights
glittered
like
a
maniac's
go
away
he
whispered
go--or----
i
thought
of
an
old
old
policeman
trick
and
assumed
an
expression
of
sudden
horror
take
care
i
cried
look
out--he
will
get
you
the
baronet
swung
around
gasping
and
ghastly
in
a
second
i
had
him
by
the
wrist
what
was
it
he
almost
shrieked
a
policeman's
trick
i
answered
coldly
and
disarmed
him
curse
you
curse
you
he
howled
and
doubling
his
fists
he
rushed
at
me
calling
on
his
blacks
the
while
the
latter
gave
me
momentary
trouble
but
it
was
soon
over
i
propped
them
up
like
lay
figures
against
the
columns
facing
each
other
afterwards
and
extracted
the
charges
from
their
guns
looking
over
the
sand
i
saw
miss
ottley
and
dr
belleville
and
the
captain
walking
under
umbrellas
towards
the
tanks
i
felt
glad
not
to
have
disturbed
them
sir
robert
had
disappeared
within
the
cavern
i
followed
him
he
had
put
on
a
large
masque
which
entirely
covered
his
face
and
he
was
fumbling
with
the
screw
stopper
of
a
huge
glass
jar
at
the
farthest
corner
of
the
cavern
the
sarcophagus
had
been
overturned
it
now
rested
in
the
centre
of
the
cavern
bottom
upwards
and
on
the
flat
leaden
surface
of
the
bottom
was
stretched
out
stiff
and
stark
the
naked
body
of
a
tall
brown-skinned
man
the
body
glistened
as
if
it
had
been
rubbed
with
oil
it
was
almost
fleshless
but
sinews
and
tendons
stood
out
everywhere
like
tightened
cords
one
might
almost
have
taken
it
for
a
mummy
it
had
however
an
appearance
of
life--or
rather
of
suspended
animation
for
it
did
not
move
i
wondered
and
stepped
closer
to
examine
it
i
looked
at
the
face
and
recognised
the
arab
who
had
attacked
me
on
the
previous
night
the
arab
who
had
frightened
miss
ottley
and
myself
more
than
once
his
mouth
was
tight
shut
his
eyes
were
however
open
slightly
he
did
not
seem
to
breathe
i
put
my
finger
on
his
cheek
and
pressed
the
flesh
did
not
yield
i
ran
my
eyes
down
his
frame
and
uttered
a
cry
three
of
his
ribs
were
broken
then
i
felt
his
pulse
it
was
still
the
wrist
was
as
rigid
as
steel--the
arm
too--nay
the
whole
man
he
is
dead
i
exclaimed
at
last
and
looked
at
sir
robert
the
little
baronet
was
re-stoppering
the
glass
jar
but
he
held
a
glass
in
one
hand
half
filled
with
some
sort
of
liquid
presently
he
approached
me--but
most
marvellously
slowly
illustration
the
living
mummy
i
felt
his
pulse

this
man
is
dead
i
said
to
him
he
attacked
me
last
night
i
threw
him
and
perhaps
broke
his
ribs
but
i
did
not
kill
him
for
he
fled
how
comes
it
he
is
dead
sir
robert
for
answer
threw
at
my
feet
the
contents
of
the
jar
then
i
understood
why
he
wore
the
masque
the
cavern
was
filled
with
the
fumes
of
the
deadly
perfume
of
the
sarcophagus
on
instant
one
sniff
and
my
senses
were
rocking
i
held
my
breath
but
in
spite
of
that
the
cavern
swung
round
me
with
vertiginous
rapidity
it
seemed
best
to
retire
i
did
so
but
how
i
hardly
know
somehow
or
another
i
reached
the
pylon
passed
the
blacks
and
stepped
upon
the
sand
about
fifty
paces
off
i
saw
a
beautiful
grove
of
palm
trees
suddenly
spring
up
out
of
the
desert
such
magic
was
most
astonishing
i
said
to
myself
they
cannot
be
real
of
course
i
am
merely
imagining
them
but
their
shade
was
so
deliciously
inviting
that
i
simply
had
to
accept
its
challenge
i
entered
the
grove
and
sat
down
beside
a
little
purling
stream
of
crystal
water
it
was
very
pleasant
to
dip
my
hands
in
it
presently
a
lovely
naiad
rose
up
out
of
the
pool
seized
my
hands
and
pressed
them
to
her
lips
that
was
pleasant
too
then
she
came
and
sat
quite
near
me
on
the
banks
of
the
rill
and
drew
my
head
upon
her
lap
and
stroked
cool
fingers
through
my
hair
crooning
a
tender
love
song
all
the
while
that
was
pleasantest
of
all
but
her
crooning
made
me
drowsy
like
the
lorelei's
song
it
charmed
away
my
senses
and
i
slept
chapter
ix
a
cool
defiance
of
course
i
had
swooned
and
equally
of
course
not
on
the
bank
of
a
rivulet
and
under
the
cool
shade
of
palm
trees
but
in
the
full
blaze
of
the
mid-day
sun
and
on
the
smooth
unprotected
burning
surface
of
the
desert
it
was
the
accursed
sarcophagus
perfume
that
had
worked
the
mischief
fortunately
miss
ottley
saw
me
fall
otherwise
i
might
have
had
a
sunstroke
belleville
and
the
captain
carried
me
between
them
to
the
shade
of
one
of
the
pylons
and
belleville
opened
a
vein
in
my
left
arm--a
proceeding
i
am
prevented
from
commenting
on
by
considerations
of
professional
etiquette
happily
i
recovered
consciousness
in
time
to
save
a
little
of
my
precious
blood
i
told
belleville
my
opinion
of
him
in
one
comprehensive
scowl
which
he
interpreted
correctly
i
am
glad
to
say
and
then
got
up
i
bandaged
my
arm
myself
and
made
off
for
the
captain's
tent
that
gentleman
followed
me
there
arrived
i
cast
myself
upon
the
cot
and
swore
at
ease
weldon
listened
in
spellbound
admiration
he
afterwards
assured
me
that
he
had
never
before
encountered
such
proficient
fluency
in
objurgation
and
invective
i
was
madder
than
a
hatter
and
the
more
because
i
was
as
weak
as
a
cat
and
i
wanted
to
be
strong
with
all
my
soul
yet
five
days
passed
before
i
felt
well
enough
to
be
able
to
attack
the
task
in
front
of
me
meanwhile
i
told
the
captain
very
little
and
miss
ottley
nothing
how
could
i
let
her
know
i
knew
her
father
to
be
a
confounded
old
rascal
she
was
very
good
she
visited
me
every
day
and
spent
hours
reading
aloud
by
my
bedside
while
the
captain
and
i
watched
her
face
and
thought
much
the
same
thoughts
though
i
took
care
for
my
own
part
not
to
let
my
features
reflect
the
fatuous
devotion
of
the
captain's
on
the
sixth
morning
i
found
i
could
lift
that
young
man
shoulder-high
with
one
hand
without
wanting
to
sit
down
and
pant
afterwards
so
i
got
up
it
was
just
after
daylight
the
captain
wanted
to
accompany
me
but
i
thought
differently
he
was
annoyed
but
i
let
him
watch
me
from
the
tent
flap
i
found
sir
robert
talking
to
dr
belleville
at
the
door
of
the
cave
temple
his
greeting
was
quite
affectionate
so
glad
you
are
better
again
my
dear
young
friend
he
said
and
he
warmly
invited
me
into
the
chamber
it
was
almost
empty
the
jar
of
perfume
had
gone
the
sarcophagus
had
disappeared
it
contained
only
a
table
and
a
cot
sit
down
said
sir
robert
where
is
the
sarcophagus
i
demanded
the
old
rascal
grinned
i
had
it
quietly
transferred
last
night
on
a
truck
to
a
punt
he
replied
while
you
were
enjoying
your
beauty
sleep
dr
belleville
and
i
have
not
been
to
bed
at
all
it
is
now
on
the
road
to
cairo--and
england
i
sat
down
on
the
cot
and
the
dead
arab
i
questioned
dr
belleville
choked
back
a
laugh
sir
robert
smiled
the
dead
arab
you
saw
was
the
mortal
casket
of
ptahmes
said
he
i
am
not
surprised
at
your
mistake
the
body
is
in
a
perfect
state
of
preservation
it
is
not
a
mummy
in
any
sense
of
the
expression
i
regret
very
much
that
your
sudden
indisposition
prevented
you
from
examining
it
closely
and
me
from
explaining
the
circumstances
of
its
preservation
and
discovery
on
the
spot
however
i
can
tell
you
this
much
now
we
found
it
steeped
in
an
essential
oil
which
an
hermetic
process
had
defended
from
evaporation
the
oil
began
to
evaporate
immediately
it
was
exposed
to
the
air
but
i
contrived
to
save
a
certain
quantity
with
which
later
i
purpose
to
experiment
in
london
the
egyptian
authorities
have
been
very
good
to
me
they
have
given
me
all
necessary
powers
to
deal
with
my
discovery
as
i
please
i
tell
you
this
lest
professional
jealousy
should
lead
you
to
attempt
any
interference
with
my
actions
in
plain
words
sir
robert
you
wish
me
to
understand
that
your
discovery
is
for
you
and
not
for
the
world
hardly
that
my
dear
pinsent
merely
that
i
propose
to
choose
my
own
time
for
taking
the
world
into
my
confidence--and
that
of
dr
belleville
he
added
bowing
to
his
friend
an
unusual
course
for
a
professed
scientist
to
adopt
i
have
very
little
sympathy
with
conventionality
cooed
sir
robert
and
i
said
belleville
the
point
of
view
of
two
burglars
i
observed
i
scowled
at
belleville
you
shall
be
as
rude
as
you
please
you
saved
my
life
said
sir
robert
dr
belleville
cleared
his
throat
ahem--ahem
said
he
the
discourtesy
of
the
disappointed
is--ahem--is
a
tribute
to
the
merits
of
the
more
successful
in
my
rage
i
descended
to
abuse
you
are
a
nasty
old
swindler
i
said
to
sir
robert
but
your
grey
hair
protects
you
for
the
present
but
as
for
you
sir
i
turned
to
belleville
you
black
bull-dog--if
you
dare
so
much
as
to
open
your
lips
to
me
again
i'll
wring
your
flabby
nose
off
the
baronet
turned
scarlet
the
doctor
went
livid
but
neither
of
them
said
a
word
i
strode
to
the
door
intending
to
quit
but
there
rage
mastered
me
again
i
swung
on
heel
and
once
more
faced
them
one
word
more
i
grated
out
you're
not
done
with
me
yet
either
of
you
i'm
a
peaceful
man
by
nature
but
no
man
treads
on
my
toes
with
impunity
spiritualists
or
spirit-summoners
you
are
i
hear
weldon
calls
you
spook-hunters--a
very
proper
term
you'll
need
all
the
money
you
possess
between
you
and
all
the
spirits'
help
you'll
buy
from
your
rascal
spirit-rappers
to
keep
me
from
your
trail
looking
for
the
elixir
of
life
i'm
told
it
will
go
hard
if
i
don't
help
you
find
it
the
elixir
of
public
ridicule
that
i'll
turn
upon
you
will
hand
your
names
down
to
posterity
i'll
help
you
to
that
much
immortality
at
least
and
gratis
too
good-day
to
you
dr
pinsent
shouted
ottley
i
paused
and
glanced
at
him
across
my
shoulder
he
gazed
at
me
with
eyes
that
simply
blazed
be
warned
he
hissed
if
you
value
your
life
let
me
and
mine
alone
i'll
send
a
cheque
to
your
tent
to-day
keep
it
call
quits
and
i'm
done
with
you
i
owe
you
that
consideration
but
no
more
and
suppose
on
the
other
hand----
cross
me
and
you
shall
see
you
sleep
sometimes
i
suppose
my
emissary
will
not
always
find
you
wakeful
he
never
sleeps
your
rascal
arab
i
shouted
pah
he
cried
murderer
it
was
to
you
i
owe
that
rough
and
tumble
a
week
ago
at
my
own
camp
in
the
desert
to
me
he
mumbled
to
me
whom
else
my
agents
are
spirits
and
invisible
they
do
not
love
you
for
despising
them
they
have
tortures
in
reserve
for
you
when
you
are
dead
and
you
too
are
a
spirit
but
i
would
be
merciful--i
shall
send
you
a
cheque
return
it
at
your
peril
now
go
go
go
on
a
sudden
i
was
cold
as
ice
the
man
was
evidently
insane
he
seemed
on
the
brink
of
a
fit
he
was
frothing
at
the
mouth
softly
softly
sir
robert
i
said
soothingly
no
need
for
excitement
calm
yourself
after
all
this
is
a
business
transaction
oh
he
gasped
then
broke
into
a
wild
laugh
a
mere
matter
of
price
i
should
have
known
it
a
scotchman
exactly
said
i
and
my
price
is
a
million
good-morning
the
whole
camp
was
astir
the
negroes'
tents
were
all
down
and
rolled
the
mules
and
asses
were
being
loaded
heavily
evidently
sir
robert
was
about
to
flit
after
the
corpse
of
ptahmes
i
found
miss
ottley
and
the
captain
talking
over
the
apparent
move
the
girl
was
agitated
she
had
not
been
consulted
it
was
not
a
time
to
mince
matters
i
told
her
frankly
everything
that
had
passed
between
her
father
and
myself
and
hardly
had
i
finished
when
she
rushed
off
hot
foot
to
visit
him
the
captain
went
with
her
i
made
a
passably
good
breakfast
chapter
x
the
capture
of
the
coffin
about
noon--i
saw
no
one
but
blacks
in
the
meanwhile--the
captain
came
with
a
letter
from
sir
robert--catch
said
he
i
tore
it
open
a
single
sheet
of
note
enclosed
a
cheque
signed
in
blank
dear
dr
pinsent
ran
the
letter
you
will
find
that
my
signature
will
be
honoured
for
any
sum
it
may
please
you
to
put
upon
my
life
in
your
esteem
permit
me
to
express
a
hope
that
you
will
not
hurt
my
vanity
in
your
selection
of
numerals
sincerely
yours
robert
ottley
i
handed
the
note
to
weldon
he
read
it
and
whistled
loud
and
long
you
might
beggar
him
he
cried
the
man
is
stark
mad
either
that
or
he
has
made
a
truly
wonderful
discovery
i
rejoined
and
there
is
belleville
to
consider
that
man
i
fancy
is
a
rascal--but
also
a
sane
one
it
has
me
beat
said
the
handsome
captain
the
whole
thing
from
start
to
finish
ottley
is
up
there
now
spooning
his
daughter
like
a
lover
he
was
as
sweet
as
pie
to
me
too
i
feel
like
a
stranded
jelly-fish
what
will
you
do
i
enclosed
the
cheque
in
a
blank
cover
sealed
it
and
gave
it
to
the
captain
will
you
be
my
courier
of
course
said
he
and
swung
off
he
returned
at
the
end
of
my
third
cigar
with
a
second
letter
it
ran
my
dear
young
friend
your
refusal
has
deeply
pained
me
the
more
because
it
deprives
me
of
the
pleasure
of
your
company
on
the
road
to
cairo
i
beg
you
nevertheless
to
choose
from
my
stores
all
that
you
may
require
that
may
serve
you
during
your
continued
sojourn
at
rakh
we
start
at
sunset
for
the
nile
and
north
ever
yours
attachedly
r
ottley
when
the
captain
had
mastered
this
precious
effusion
he
collapsed
upon
a
stool
he
intends
to
leave
you
here
alone
in
the
desert
it's--it's
marooning
nothing
less
he
gasped
i
lighted
a
fourth
cigar
and
lay
back
thinking
hard
in
ten
minutes
i
had
made
up
my
mind
i
sat
up
the
captain
was
anxiously
watching
me
see
here
my
lad
i
said
in
that
bundle
yonder
is
the
manuscript
of
a
book
i
have
been
working
hard
upon
for
three
years
and
more
it
is
the
very
heart
of
me
take
good
care
of
it
one
of
these
days--if
i
live--i'll
call
for
it
at
your
diggings
in
london
i
have
your
address
in
my
notebook
oh
oh
oh
said
the
captain
but
what's
the
game
diamond
cut
diamond
i'm
going
a
journey
but
i'll
say
no
more
mad
or
sane
you
are
eating
ottley's
salt
and
are
beholden
to
him
for
his
paternity
of
the
exceptionally
gifted
young
woman
you
propose
to
marry
good-bye
to
you
i
held
out
my
hand
he
sprang
up
and
wrung
it
hard
you
are
sure
you
are
doing
right
he
asked
i
filled
my
pockets
with
his
cigars
i
am
sure
of
nothing
i
replied
as
i
did
so
except
this--i
have
been
abominably
ill-used
by
a
man
who
under
heaven
owes
his
life
to
me--and
this--i
resent
it
i
put
on
my
helmet
nodded
and
left
the
tent
the
captain
cried
out
good
luck
five
minutes
later
i
turned
and
waved
my
hand
to
him
he
was
still
standing
by
the
tent
flap
gazing
after
me
i
thought
to
myself
he
is
as
honest
as
he
is
good
to
look
upon
he
will
make
may
ottley
a
gallant
husband
i
am
a
reasonably
bad
christian
and
quite
as
selfish
as
many
worse
but
somehow
or
another
the
reflection
brought
no
aftermath
of
bitterness
the
handsome
happy-hearted
boy--he
was
little
else
for
all
his
three
and
thirty
years--had
crept
into
my
heart
and
i
felt
somehow
the
chamber
he
occupied
was
next
door
to
that
wherein
may
ottley's
visage
was
enshrined
but
i
had
work
to
do
so
i
turned
the
key
on
both
the
sun
was
so
hideously
hot
that
i
was
forced
to
hasten
slowly
but
i
reached
the
nile
under
two
hours
and
found
as
i
expected
sir
robert
ottley's
steam
launch
moored
to
the
bank
her
smoking
funnel
had
been
the
beacon
of
my
march
she
was
in
charge
of
an
old
french
pilot
a
turkish
engineer
and
four
levantines
piratical-looking
stokers
mongrels
all
i
stalked
aboard
with
an
air
of
paramount
authority
the
frenchman
came
forward
bowing
he
wore
a
sort
of
uniform
steam
up
captain
i
asked
since
morning
monsieur
he
replied
then
kindly
push
off
at
once
i
must
overtake
the
punt
that
started
last
night
without
delay
his
mouth
opened
but
monsieur
he
protested
i----
you
waste
time
i
interrupted
he
rubbed
his
hands
nervously
together
but
monsieur
is
unknown
to
me
i
have
my
written
orders
from
sare
roberrrrt
doubtless
monsieur
has
authority
but
monsieur
vill
perrceive----
that
you
are
a
punctilious
old
fool
i
retorted
here
is
my
authority
what
i
showed
him
was
a
revolver
he
jumped
i
vow
two
feet
in
the
air
and
hastily
retreated
but
i
followed
more
quickly
still
and
forced
him
to
the
bridge
there
he
became
very
voluble
however
so
much
so
indeed
that
i
was
constrained
to
cock
my
pistol
that
settled
him
he
thundered
out
his
orders
and
we
were
soon
racing
at
ten
knots
an
hour
down
stream
when
rounding
the
nearest
bend
to
the
hill
of
rakh
the
temptation
was
very
strong
in
me
to
sound
the
steamer's
whistle
but
i
am
proud
to
say
that
i
refrained
it
would
have
been
a
little-minded
thing
to
do
about
midnight
feeling
weary
i
ran
the
steamer's
nose
gently
into
a
mud
bank
drove
the
captain
down
to
the
deck
and
locked
him
with
the
rest
of
the
crew
in
the
engine-house
then
i
foraged
round
for
eatables
made
a
hearty
supper
and
snatched
about
five
hours'
sleep
when
morning
came
i
awoke
as
fresh
and
strong
as
a
young
colt
after
bath
and
breakfast
i
released
my
prisoners
made
them
eat
and
then
push
off
the
bank
we
lost
an
hour
at
that
job
but
at
length
it
was
accomplished
and
our
race
for
the
punt
recommenced
we
overhauled
it
about
four
o'clock
the
same
afternoon
it
was
just
an
ordinary
flat-bottomed
nile
abomination
towed
by
a
tiny
panting
puffing-billy
with
twenty
yards
of
good
manilla
twelve
arabs
squatted
round
the
sarcophagus
seated
on
the
sarcophagus
under
a
double
awning
was
a
burly-looking
englishman
he
was
smoking
a
pipe
and
one
look
at
his
face
told
me
exactly
why
he
had
been
entrusted
with
sir
robert
ottley's
priceless
treasure
he
was
as
plain
as
daylight
a
gentleman
if
one
ever
lived
a
brave
man
too
shrewd
and
self-reliant
and
as
incorruptibly
devoted
to
his
duty
as
a
bull-dog
with
a
thief's
hand
between
his
jaws
i
wondered
if
i
would
get
the
better
of
him
as
a
first
step
towards
that
desideratum
i
assured
the
french
captain
that
i
entertained
too
much
regard
for
him
to
put
him
to
a
lingering
death
should
he
disobey
me
i
had
previously
locked
the
rest
of
the
crew
in
the
engine-house
then
we
bore
down
on
the
punt
and
i
shouted
for
the
tug
to
be
stopped
this
was
done
as
it
lost
way
we
nosed
up
going
easy
until
we
were
alongside
the
punt
then
i
ordered
half
speed
astern
until
we
too
were
stationary
some
power
of
suction
or
attraction
began
immediately
to
draw
the
two
crafts
together
the
tug
however
continued
to
remain
say
thirty
feet
off
the
englishman
ordered
out
rope
fenders
and
asked
me
what
the
blazes
i
was
doing
i
answered
that
i
had
come
after
him
from
sir
robert
ottley--which
was
in
a
sense
perfectly
true--and
that
he
could
hardly
expect
me
to
shout
out
urgent
private
business
before
listeners
which
was
also
a
reasonably
veracious
statement
of
the
facts
the
englishman--i
never
learned
his
name--observed
with
some
heat
that
he
would
not
leave
his
charge
for
a
second
for
any
man
living
except
sir
robert
ottley
and
that
if
i
had
something
to
tell
him
i
must
go
aboard
the
punt
i
said
very
well
and
as
the
crafts
touched
i
helped
myself
to
the
punt
with
a
rope
well
what
is
it
he
demanded
and
he
eyed
me
most
suspiciously
one
hand
in
his
breast
doubtless
he
had
there
a
revolver
had
he
been
warned
and
of
me
it
is
a
thing
i
have
still
my
doubts
about
but
i
looked
him
frankly
in
the
eyes
and
told
him
the
truth
to
the
very
best
of
my
ability
it
has
lately
come
to
sir
robert
ottley's
knowledge
i
began
that
one
of
his
guests--a
man
named
pinsent
he
started
at
the
name
has
conceived
a
bold
design
of
relieving
you
of
this
very
charge
of
yours
which
you
are
guarding
with
such
praiseworthy
solicitude
oh
said
the
englishman
and
how
would
he
go
about
it
the
idea
appeared
to
tickle
him
he
laughed
he
would
follow
you
and
attack
you
said
i
the
englishman
put
his
hands
on
his
thighs
and
simply
roared
he
would
have
to
swim
after
me
he
chuckled
there
is
not
another
launch
save
these
two
between
here
and
ham
i
am
honestly
glad
to
hear
it
i
replied
and
indeed
i
was
it's
a
mare's
nest
declared
the
englishman
oh
said
i
this
pinsent
is
a
desperate
fellow
and
resourceful
do
you
know
he
actually
tried
single-handed
to
seize
that
launch
the
swallow
cried
the
englishman
impossible
on
the
contrary
i
retorted
he
succeeded
he
stands
before
you
my
name
is
pinsent
permit
me
he
was
a
trifle
slow-witted
i
fancy
he
still
looked
puzzled
when
his
face
emerged
above
the
nile
water
after
his
dive
but
i
would
not
let
him
return
to
the
punt
immediately
i
discovered
that
the
arabs
were
only
armed
with
knives
i
had
taken
the
trouble
to
throw
overboard
all
the
firearms
that
i
could
find
on
the
swallow
so
i
just
drove
them
aboard
the
launch
and
ordered
the
frenchman
to
sheer
off
and
return
to
rakh
he
was
charmed
at
the
permission
the
englishman
fired
at
me
twice
from
the
water
but
he
had
to
keep
himself
afloat
so
he
naturally
missed
when
he
was
well-nigh
drowned
i
hauled
him
up
with
a
boat
hook
it
was
easy
to
disarm
him
in
that
condition
i
had
intended
to
put
him
on
the
tug
but
i
waited
too
long
the
tug
cut
the
tow
rope
before
my
eyes
and
without
so
much
as
by
your
leave
puffed
after
the
swallow
the
englishman
and
i
were
thus
left
lonely
on
the
punt
in
middle
stream
the
current
was
fairly
strong
at
that
point
and
making
towards
a
long
low-lying
sweep
of
reedy
flats
i
had
no
mind
to
land
there
however
so
after
tying
up
the
englishman
neck
and
crop
i
contrived
to
hoist
a
sail
and
steered
for
the
opposite
bank
the
englishman
and
i
had
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
no
doubt
he
recognised
the
futility
of
conversation
in
the
circumstances
as
for
me
i
never
felt
less
inclined
to
talk
about
five
o'clock
we
grounded
under
the
lee
of
a
pretty
little
promontory
it
was
populated
with
crocodiles
nice
companions--at
a
distance--crocodiles--musky-smelling
brutes
chapter
xi
good-bye
to
the
nile
the
englishman
was
evidently
something
of
a
gourmet
i
found
foie
gras
camembert
cheese
pressed
sheep's
tongues
and
bottled
british
ale
in
his
private
locker
but
he
was
as
sullen
as
a
sore-headed
grizzly
he
sourly
declined
to
eat
even
though
i
offered
to
free
his
hands
and
he
strove
to
make
my
dinner
unpleasant
by
volunteering
pungent
information
on
the
punishment
provided
by
law
for
the
crimes
of
piracy
robbery
under
arms
burglary
assault
and
battery
and
false
imprisonment
those
it
seems
were
the
titular
heads
of
some
of
my
delinquencies
he
felt
sure
that
i
would
get
ten
years'
hard
labour
at
least
i
did
not
argue
the
point
with
him
after
dinner
i
examined
the
sarcophagus
the
lid
was
fastened
on
with
crosswise-running
bands
of
hinged
steel
padlocked
in
the
centre
but
it
was
strange
to
say
wedged
at
one
end
with
iron
bolts
about
an
inch
ajar
as
if
on
purpose
to
allow
air
to
pass
into
the
coffin
after
a
little
search
i
discovered
a
toolbox
in
the
shallow
hold
of
the
punt
and
i
attacked
the
bands
with
cold
chisels
and
a
mallet
ten
minutes'
work
sufficed
i
tossed
the
broken
bands
aside
and
levered
off
the
lid
my
heart
beat
like
a
trip-hammer
as
i
looked
into
the
coffin
i
was
prepared
for
a
surprise
i
received
one
my
arab
gazed
up
at
me
the
mysterious
arab
with
the
three
broken
ribs
who
had
frightened
miss
ottley
and
tried
to
throttle
me
and
whom
i
had
last
seen
lying--a
corpse--in
the
cave
temple
at
rakh
of
course
sir
robert
ottley
had
declared
the
corpse
in
the
temple
to
be
identical
with
that
of
ptahmes
the
four
thousand
years
dead
high
priest
of
amen-ra
but
that
was
ridiculous
i
had
only
had
time
to
make
a
cursory
examination
of
the
dead
arab
in
the
cave
temple
it
is
true
but
i
am
a
surgeon
and
i
had
convinced
myself
that
the
fellow
so
far
from
being
a
mummy
had
not
been
long
dead
i
had
yet
to
discover
an
essential
error
in
my
cave
temple
investigation
my
very
first
impression
had
been
not
death
but
suspended
animation
and
i
must
have
been
right
the
later
speedy
diagnosis
had
in
sober
truth
misled
me
the
man
was
not
dead
it
had
been
a
case
of
suspended
animation
the
arab
lying
in
the
sarcophagus
before
me
was
alive
his
broken
ribs
were
neatly
set
and
bandaged
otherwise
he
was
swathed
from
head
to
foot
in
oiled
rags
he
was
lying
in
an
easy
position
on
his
back--upon
a
doubled
feather
tick
he
was
breathing
softly
but
unmistakably
and
he
was
awake
his
extraordinary
eyes--they
were
set
fully
five
inches
apart
in
his
abnormally
broad
skull--were
wide
open
and
staring
at
me
in
a
way
to
make
the
flesh
creep
they
were
horrible
eyes
the
whites
were
sepia-coloured
the
pupils
were
yellowish
and
the
iris
of
each
a
different
shade
of
black
flecked
with
scarlet
spots
his
cone-shaped
forehead
was
moist
and
glistening
with
oil
or
perspiration
his
mouth
was
held
open
by
two
small
rubber-tipped
metal
bars
joined
together
against
which
his
teeth--great
brown
fangs--pressed
with
manifest
spasmodic
energy
now
what
was
ottley's
purpose
in
taking
such
extraordinary
pains
to
transport
a
living
arab
in
a
dead
man's
coffin
from
rakh
to
cairo
and
perhaps
london
perhaps
the
arab
could
tell
me
burning
with
curiosity
i
stooped
down
and
took
from
his
mouth
the
mechanical
contrivances
which
held
the
jaws
apart
the
arab
uttered
on
the
instant
a
deep
raucous
sigh
his
eyeballs
rolled
upwards
and
became
fixed
he
appeared
to
have
fainted
i
rushed
away
to
procure
some
water
that
water
was
in
the
hold
seizing
a
dipper
i
sprang
down
the
steps
hurried
to
the
cask
and
filled
it
the
whole
business
occupied
only
a
few
seconds
i
certainly
could
not
have
been
away
from
the
deck
half
a
minute
but
when
i
returned
the
sarcophagus
was
empty
the
arab
had
disappeared
utterly
astounded
i
gazed
about
me
had
the
whole
thing
been
a
dream
it
appeared
so
but
no--i
caught
sight
of
a
tall
dark
figure
making
off
hot
foot
across
the
promontory
he
had
leaped
ashore
a
distance
of
twelve
feet
or
more
and
was
running
towards
the
desert
in
a
second
i
was
after
him
i
thought
of
the
crocodiles
while
in
mid
air
but
it
was
too
late
to
turn
back
at
that
juncture
my
feet
landed
in
a
patch
of
oozy
sand
i
scrambled
out
of
it
and
up
the
slope
among
the
reeds
a
loud
rustle
and
a
stink
of
musk
warned
me
of
a
saurian
neighbour
i
gave
a
mighty
leap
and
cleared
the
reeds
then
i
ran
as
i
had
never
run
before
for
my
arab
was
in
front
and
a
hungry
monster
came
hard
upon
my
heels
a
log
lay
in
my
path
it
was
another
crocodile
i
cleared
it
with
a
bound
and
gained
the
desert
i
was
hunted
for
some
seconds
i
believe
but
i
never
looked
back
so
i
do
not
know
at
what
point
the
saurian
gave
up
the
chase
the
arab
was
a
marvel
he
had
a
lead
of
one
hundred
yards
and
he
maintained
it
he
had
three
broken
ribs
and
i
was
as
sound
as
a
bell
yet
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
not
his
breath
but
mine
gave
out
i
was
forced
to
pause
for
a
spell
he
ran
on
his
lead
doubled
setting
my
teeth
i
resumed
the
chase
but
i
might
have
spared
myself
the
trouble
he
gradually
grew
farther
and
farther
away
from
me
i
did
my
best
but
at
last
i
was
compelled
to
admit
myself
beaten
the
arab's
tall
form
grew
less
and
less
distinguishable
against
the
stars
finally
it
melted
into
the
mists
of
the
horizon
i
was
alone
on
the
desert
i
sat
down
to
rest
and
took
counsel
with
myself
i
had
turned
pirate
and
committed
technically
a
number
of
other
atrocious
crimes
for
absolutely
nothing
plainly
i
could
not
return
to
the
punt
first
of
all
in
order
to
reach
it
i
should
have
to
face
the
crocodiles
and
even
should
i
escape
their
jaws
again
what
could
i
do
on
the
river
sooner
or
later
i
should
be
caught
and
i
had
a
very
strong
suspicion
that
sir
robert
ottley
would
not
hesitate
once
i
was
in
his
power
to
plunge
me
into
an
egyptian
prison
he
had
evidence
enough
to
get
me
a
long
term
of
hard
labour
and
i
felt
little
doubt
but
that
he
would
go
to
a
lot
of
trouble
for
that
and
con
amore
after
the
way
that
i
had
served
him
it
did
not
therefore
take
me
long
to
resolve
to
risk
the
desert
rather
than
rot
in
an
egyptian
gaol
i
had
spilt
a
lot
of
milk
i
was
foodless
waterless
and
gods
knows
where
also
i
was
as
thirsty
as
a
lime
kiln
but
no
use
crying
what
to
do
that
was
the
question
for
a
start
i
lay
down
and
pressed
my
cheek
against
the
ground
the
horizon
thus
examined
showed
a
faintly
circled
unbroken
level
line
in
all
directions
except
the
northwest
there
it
was
interrupted
for
a
space
by
a
mound
that
was
either
a
cloud-bank
or
a
grove
of
trees
it
proved
to
be
the
latter
i
found
there
water
to
drink
and
dates
to
eat
next
morning
i
took
my
bearings
from
the
sun
and
giving
the
river
a
wide
berth
i
pressed
on
north
for
two
days
and
nights
on
an
empty
stomach
then
i
shot
an
ibis
with
my
revolver
in
a
reedy
marsh
and
ate
it
raw
next
day
i
climbed
into
the
mountains
and
looked
back
on
assuan
and
philã¦
but
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
describe
my
wanderings
minutely
it
would
take
too
long
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
changed
clothes
with
an
arab
near
redesieh
and
entered
eonah
dyed
as
a
nubian
a
week
later
after
crossing
the
river
at
el-kab
in
a
fisherman's
canoe
the
nile
was
still
ringing
with
my
doings
so
i
judged
it
best
to
proceed
on
foot
to
luqsor
but
there
i
got
a
job
in
a
dahabeah
that
was
conveying
a
party
of
french
savants
back
from
elephantine
to
abydos
i
stayed
with
them
three
weeks
hearing
much
talk
meanwhile
of
a
certain
rascally
scotch
doctor
named
pinsent
it
was
supposed
he
had
perished
in
the
desert
one
day
however
hearing
that
sir
robert
ottley
who
had
been
lying
at
thebes
had
been
seen
at
lykopolis
i
deserted
from
my
employ
and
walked
back
to
farschat
there
i
bought
a
passage
on
a
store-boat
and
came
by
easy
stages
to
beni
hassan
thence
i
tramped
to
abu
girgeh
where
i
lay
for
a
fortnight
ill
of
a
wasting
fever
in
the
house
of
a
man
i
had
formerly
befriended
a
large
reward
had
been
offered
for
my
arrest
but
he
was
an
arab
of
the
better
sort
so
far
from
betraying
me
to
outraged
justice
he
cashed
my
cheque
for
a
respectable
amount
and
procured
me
a
passage
to
cairo
on
a
river
steamer
i
entered
the
ancient
city
of
memphis
one
day
at
dusk
a
wreck
of
my
old
self
and
as
black
as
the
ace
of
spades
not
daring
to
reclaim
my
goods
at
my
lodging-house
i
proceeded
forthwith
to
alexandria
with
no
wardrobe
save
the
clothes
upon
my
back
and
so
anxious
was
i
to
escape
from
egypt
that
i
shipped
as
stoker
on
a
french
steamer
bound
for
marseilles
i
could
find
none
that
would
take
a
negro
as
passenger
the
dye
pretty
well
wore
off
my
face
and
hands
during
the
voyage
but
the
circumstance
only
excited
remark
among
the
motley
scum
of
the
stokehole
and
i
was
permitted
to
land
without
dispute
heavens
how
beautiful
it
was
to
dress
once
more
as
a
european
to
eat
european
food
to
sleep
on
a
european
bed
and
not
to
be
afraid
to
look
a
european
in
the
face
in
europe
i
did
not
care
a
pin
for
sir
robert
ottley
and
all
that
he
could
do
to
hurt
me
in
egypt
his
money
and
influence
would
have
left
me
helpless
to
resist
him
but
i
felt
myself
something
more
than
his
match
in
the
centre
of
modern
civilisation
he
had
the
law
of
me
of
course
but
i
had
a
weapon
to
bring
him
to
book
i
could
hold
him
up
to
public
scorn
and
ridicule
were
he
to
prosecute
me
i
could
put
him
in
the
pillory
as
a
wretch
ungrateful
for
his
life
saved
by
my
care
and
skill
a
promise-breaker
and
something
of
a
lunatic
on
the
whole
i
decided
he
would
not
venture
to
put
me
in
the
dock
and
so
sure
did
i
feel
on
that
head
that
i
proceeded
to
london
as
fast
as
steam
could
carry
me
chapter
xii
the
meeting
whenever
in
london
my
practice
for
years
had
been
to
put
up
at
my
friend
dixon
hubbard's
rooms
in
bruton
street
we
had
been
schoolfellows
he
was
one
of
the
most
fortunate
and
unfortunate
creatures
in
the
world
born
with
a
silver
spoon
in
his
mouth
he
had
inherited
from
some
cross-grained
ancestor
a
biting
tongue
and
a
gloomy
disposition
he
was
an
incurable
misanthrope
and
unpopular
beyond
words
at
college
he
had
been
detested
being
a
sickly
lad
his
tongue
had
earned
him
many
a
thrashing
which
he
had
had
to
endure
without
other
reprisal
than
sarcasm
yet
he
had
never
spared
that
his
spirit
was
unconquerable
i
believe
that
he
would
have
taunted
his
executioners
while
they
burned
him
at
the
stake
i
used
to
hate
him
myself
once
but
one
day
after
giving
him
a
fairly
good
hammering
i
fell
so
in
love
with
the
manly
way
in
which
he
immediately
thereafter
gave
me
a
sound
excuse
for
wringing
his
neck
that
i
begged
his
pardon
for
being
a
hulking
bully
in
having
lifted
hand
against
a
weaker
body
but
a
keener
brain
and
more
untamable
spirit
than
my
own
that
conquered
him
from
that
moment
we
were
inseparable
chums
and
on
an
average
the
privilege
cost
me
at
least
two
hard
fights
a
week
for
my
code
was--hit
my
chum
and
you
hit
me
his
gratitude
lay
in
jibing
at
me
if
i
lost
the
fight
and
if
i
won
informing
me
that
i
was
a
fool
for
my
pains
but
we
understood
each
other
and
our
friendship
bravely
withstood
the
test
of
time
and
circumstance
i
found
him
nursing
an
attack
of
splenitic
rheumatism
before
a
fire
in
his
study
and
we
were
still
only
in
the
middle
of
july
his
man
miller
had
just
broken
a
sã©vres
vase
and
hubbard
was
telling
miller
in
a
gentle
measured
way
his
views
of
clumsiness
in
serving-men
miller--a
meek
dog-like
creature
usually--stood
before
his
master
glowing
but
inarticulate
with
rage
his
fists
were
clenched
and
his
lips
were
drawn
back
from
his
teeth
hubbard
was
evidently
enjoying
himself
he
watched
the
effect
of
his
placid
exhortation
with
a
sweet
smile--and
he
applied
his
mordant
softly
uttered
gibes
with
the
pride
of
a
sculptor
at
work
upon
an
image
each
one
produced
some
trifling
but
significant
change
in
miller's
expression
probably
hubbard
was
experimenting--seeking
to
discover
either
how
far
he
could
go
with
safety
or
exactly
what
it
would
be
necessary
to
say
in
order
to
make
miller
spring
at
his
throat
they
were
both
so
engrossed
that
i
entered
without
disturbing
them
i
listened
for
a
moment
and
then
created
a
diversion
miller's
tension
was
positively
dangerous
i
walked
over
took
him
by
the
collar
and
propelled
him
from
the
room
you'll
find
my
bag
downstairs
i
said
i've
come
to
stay
miller
gave
me
the
look
of
a
dog
that
wants
but
does
not
dare
to
lick
your
hand
his
gratitude
was
pathetic
i
shut
the
door
in
his
face
hubbard
did
not
rise
he
did
not
even
offer
to
shake
hands
he
half
closed
his
eyes
and
murmured
in
a
tired
voice
the
bad
penny
is
back
again
and
uglier
than
ever
i
crossed
the
room
and
threw
open
a
window
then
i
marched
into
his
bedroom
seized
a
water
jug
returned
and
put
out
the
fire
you've
been
coddling
yourself
too
long
i
remarked
get
up
and
put
on
your
hat
it's
almost
one
you
are
going
to
lunch
with
me
at
verrey's
i
have
a
stiff
leg
he
remonstrated
fancy
mere
fancy
i
returned
the
room
was
full
of
steam
and
smoke
hubbard
said
a
wicked
thing
and
got
afoot
coughing
i
found
his
hat
crammed
it
on
his
skull
and
crooked
my
arm
in
his
he
declined
to
budge
and
wagged
a
blistering
tongue
but
i
laughed
and
picking
him
up
i
carried
him
bodily
downstairs
to
a
cab
he
called
me
forty
sorts
of
cowardly
bully
in
his
gentle
sweetly
courteous
tones
but
before
two
blocks
were
passed
his
ill-humour
had
evaporated
he
remembered
he
had
news
to
give
me
we
had
not
met
for
eighteen
months
of
a
sudden
he
stopped
beshrewing
me
and
leaned
back
in
the
cushions
i
knew
his
ways
and
talked
about
the
weather
he
endured
it
until
we
were
seated
within
the
grill-room
then
he
begged
me
very
civilly
to
let
god
manage
his
own
affairs
i
am
very
willing
i
said
he
impaled
an
oyster
on
a
fork
and
sniffed
at
it
with
brutal
indifference
to
the
waiter's
feelings
satisfied
it
was
a
good
oyster
he
swallowed
it
i
am
no
longer
a
bachelor
said
he
i
have
taken
unto
myself
a
wife
the
deuce
i
cried
exactly
he
said
but
the
prettiest
imp
imaginable
my
dear
hubbard
i
assure
you----
my
dear
pinsent
you
have
blundered
on
the
truth
but----
he
held
up
a
warning
finger
it
occurred
a
year
ago
we
lived
together
for
six
weeks
then
we
compromised
i
gave
her
my
house
in
park
lane
and
returned
myself
to
bruton
street
pish
man
don't
look
so
shocked
helen
and
i
are
friends--i
see
her
once
a
week
now
at
least
sometimes
more
often
i
assure
you
i
enjoy
her
conversation
she
has
a
natural
genius
for
gossip
and
uses
all
her
opportunities
she
has
already
become
a
fixed
star
in
the
firmament
of
society's
smartest
set
and
aspires
to
found
a
new
solar
system
i
allow
her
fifteen
thousand
pounds
a
year
she
spends
twenty
my
compensation
is
that
i
am
never
at
a
loss
for
a
subject
of
reflection
we
shall
call
on
her
this
afternoon
a
devil
but
diverting
you
will
be
amused
do
i
know
her
hubbard
no
you
are
merely
acquainted
her
maiden
name
was
arbuthnot
lady
helen
arbuthnot
i
cried
he
smiled
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
will
find
her
changed
marriage
has
developed
her
i
remember
before
you
went
away--was
it
to
egypt--she
tried
her
blandishments
on
you
but
then
she
was
a
mere
apprentice
heaven
help
you
now--if
she
marks
you
for
her
victim
poor
wretch
i
commented
i
suppose
you
can't
help
it
but
you
ought
to
make
an
effort
hubbard
really
an
effort
what
for
to
conceal
how
crudely
in
love
with
your
wife
you
are
he
bit
his
lips
and
frowned
children
and
fools
speak
the
truth
he
murmured
then
he
set
to
work
on
the
champagne
and
drank
much
more
than
was
good
for
him
the
wine
however
only
affected
his
appearance
it
brought
a
flush
to
his
pallid
cheeks
and
made
his
dull
eyes
sparkle
he
deluged
me
with
politics
till
three
o'clock
then
we
drove
to
park
lane
lady
helen
kept
us
waiting
for
twenty
minutes
in
the
meantime
two
other
callers
joined
us
men
in
order
to
show
himself
at
home
hubbard
smoked
a
cigarette
the
men
looked
pensively
appalled
they
were
poets
they
wore
long
hair
and
exotic
gardens
in
their
buttonholes
and
they
rolled
their
eyes
they
must
have
been
poets
also
they
carried
bouquets
certainly
they
were
poets
when
lady
helen
entered
they
surged
up
to
her
uttering
little
artistic
foreign
cries
and
they
kissed
her
hand
she
gave
their
bouquets
to
the
footman
with
an
air
of
fascinating
disdain
their
dejection
was
delightful
but
she
consoled
them
with
a
smile
and
advanced
to
us
certainly
she
had
changed
i
had
known
her
as
a
somewhat
unconventional
and
piquant
dã©butante
she
was
now
a
brilliant
siren
an
accomplished
coquette
and
a
woman
of
the
world
her
tiny
stature
made
her
attractive
for
she
was
perfectly
proportioned
and
her
costume
ravishingly
emphasised
the
petite
and
dainty
grace
of
her
figure
her
face
was
reminiscent
of
one
of
those
wild
flowers
of
torrid
regions
which
resemble
nothing
grown
in
an
english
garden
but
which
nevertheless
arrest
attention
and
charm
by
their
bizarrerie
it
was
full
of
eerie
wisdom
subtle
wilfulness
and
quaint
half-humorous
diablerie
in
one
word
she
was
a
sprite
she
greeted
her
husband
with
an
unctuous
affectation
of
interest
which
would
have
made
me
in
his
place
wish
to
box
her
ears
hubbard
however
was
as
good
an
actor
as
herself
he
protested
he
was
grateful
for
the
audience
and
claimed
credit
for
introducing
me
lady
helen
looked
me
up
and
down
and
remembered
that
i
had
owed
her
a
letter
for
nearly
thirty-seven
months
she
gave
me
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
then
rushed
away
to
kiss
on
both
cheeks
a
lady
who
had
just
entered
oh
you
darling
she
twittered
this
is
just
too
lovely
of
you
i
have
longed
for
you
to
come
it
was
may
ottley
she
did
not
see
me
at
once
lady
helen
utterly
engrossed
her
i
had
therefore
time
to
recover
from
the
unexpected
shock
of
her
appearance
i
was
ridiculously
agitated
i
slipped
into
an
alcove
and
picked
up
a
book
of
plates
at
first
my
hands
shook
so
that
i
could
hardly
turn
the
pages
hubbard
glided
to
my
side
i
felt
his
smile
without
seeing
it
i
smell
a
brother
idiot
he
whispered
i
met
his
eyes
and
nodded
in
egypt
of
course
yes
she
marries
a
guardsman
next
month
i
hear
indeed
the
poor
man
murmured
hubbard
come
out
and
let
us
drink
his
health
no
thank
you
you'd
rather
stay
and
singe
your
wings
poor
moth
and
you
mine
said
he
were
amputated
in
st
james
church
she
is
a
lovely
creature
pinsent
which
he
chuckled
without
replying
a
footman
pompously
announced
mrs
carr--lord
edward
dutton
bring
the
tea
please
said
lady
helen's
voice
she
is
staring
this
way
at
you
murmured
hubbard
she
recognises
your
back
no
not
quite
she
is
puzzled
she
has
never
seen
me
in
civilised
apparel
i
explained
are
you
afraid
of
her
my
boy
yes
well
you
are
honest
i
began
to
listen
for
her
voice
the
air
was
filled
with
scraps
of
conversation
three
thousand
i
tell
you
he
cannot
go
on
like
that
shouldn't
wonder
if
he
went
abroad
like
father
like
son
old
ranger
had
the
same
passion
for
bridge
you
can
say
what
you
like
names
tell
one
nothing
in
my
opinion
the
man
is
a
jew
what
if
he
does
call
himself
fortescue
consider
his
nose
i
am
tired
of
these
rich
colonials
i
have
no
time
for
them
heaven
knows
what
they
are
after
she
will
spoil
her
lower
register
completely
if
she
keeps
on
her
voice
is
a
mezzo
and
nothing
else
you
should
have
seen
the
way
old
delman
sneered
when
he
listened
to
her
last
night
my
test
of
a
really
fine
soprano
is
the
creepy
feeling
the
high
c
gives
one
in
the
small
of
the
back
delicious
she
never
thrills
me
at
all
oh
lord
edward
how
malicious
what
has
the
poor
man
done
to
you
he
plays
billiards
too
well
to
have
been
anything
but
a
marker
in
his
youth
i
believe
he
kept
a
saloon
somewhere
in
the
states
they
say
it
will
end
in
the
divorce
court
that
is
what
comes
of
marrying
a
milkmaid
and
after
all
she
did
not
present
him
with
a
son
ah
well
it's
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
young
carnarvon
is
his
heir
still
and
his
chances
of
succeeding
grow
rosier
every
day
my
dear
mrs
belvigne
if
it
was
not
for
her
red
hair
she
would
be
as
commonplace
as--as
my
dear
friend
mrs
sorenson
what
you
men
see
in
red
hair----
conscience
lady
helen
is
a
composition
of
indulgences
it
is
a
marriage
de
convenance
between
the
conventional
instinct
and
the
appetite
dr
pinsent
said
miss
ottley
is
it
really
you
i
turned
and
looked
into
her
eyes
they
were
all
aglow
and
her
cheeks
were
suffused
with
colour
she
gave
me
both
her
hands
the
room
was
already
crowded
people
entered
every
minute
hubbard
pointed
significantly
at
the
tea-cups
miss
ottley
and
i
drifted
to
the
divan
we
watched
the
crowd
through
the
parted
curtains
sipping
our
tea
we
might
as
well
have
been
in
a
box
at
the
theatre
watching
the
play
i
knew
you
would
escape
she
murmured
presently
the
others
believe
you
to
have
perished
in
the
desert
they
consoled
themselves
no
doubt
my
father
especially
did
he
recover
his
arab
what
arab
the
creature
he
had
imprisoned
in
the
sarcophagus
the
mummy
you
mean
the
body
of
pthames
oh
yes
that
was
safe
enough
but
he
was
in
a
fearful
state
until
we
found
the
punt
he
feared
that
you
would
either
steal
or
destroy
the
mummy
i
believe
miss
ottley
i
cried
you
must
not
blame
him
too
much
she
murmured
you
know
how
he
had
set
heart----
look
here
i
interrupted
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
found
the
mummy
in
the
sarcophagus
certainly
why
did
you
see
it
yes
the
mummy
why
of
course
a
dead
body
a
mummy
dr
pinsent
how
strangely
you
insist
i'll
tell
you
the
reason
when
i
opened
the
sarcophagus----
yes
it
contained
not
a
mummy
but
a
living
man
impossible
you
think
so
the
arab
was
the
very
man
who
frightened
you
so
often
in
the
temple
at
the
hill
of
rakh
dr
pinsent
when
i
removed
the
lid
he
leaped
out
of
the
sarcophagus
sprang
ashore
and
fled
to
the
desert
i
followed
him
for
several
miles
but
i
could
not
catch
him
i
was
compelled
to
give
up
the
chase
and
now
you
tell
me
that
you
afterwards
found
a
mummy
in
the
coffin
which
i
had
left
empty
one
of
us
is
dreaming
said
the
girl
what
was
this
mummy
like
a
tall
man--with
a
curious
conical-shaped
head--and
eyes
set
hideously
far
apart
in
its
skull--but
you
have
seen
the
arab
who
frightened
me--and
indeed
he
attacked
you
at
your
camp
his
mummified
counterpart
and
some
of
his
ribs
were
broken
i
do
not
know
but
his
body
was
bandaged
otherwise
he
was
almost
nude
good
heavens
she
exclaimed
she
put
down
her
cup
you
make
me
very
unhappy
you
force
me
to
recall
my
horror--in
the
cave
temple
the
wretched
uncanny
sense
of
the
supernatural
that
oppressed
me
there
you
make
me
remember
that
i
was
tortured
into
a
fancy
that
the
mummy
was
a
ghost--that
we
were
haunted--that--oh
oh
and
father
has
been
so
kind
to
me
lately
kinder
than
ever
before
he
is
in
london
yes
and
the
mummy
yes
and
dr
belleville
he
is
staying
with
us
captain
weldon
she
turned
aside
her
head
he
is
in
london
too
you
are
shortly
to
be
married
i
am
informed
she
stood
up
i
must
really
be
going
she
observed
constrainedly
then
she
held
out
her
hand
i
watched
her
pick
her
way
through
the
crowd
to
our
hostess
it
was
a
well-bred
crowd
but
it
stared
at
her
she
was
worth
looking
at
she
walked
just
as
a
woman
should
and
she
bore
herself
with
the
proper
touch
of
pride
that
is
at
the
same
time
a
personal
protection
and
a
provocative
of
curiosity
some
people
call
it
dignity
hubbard
materialised
from
the
shadow
of
a
neighbouring
curtain
my
wife
has
invited
me
to
dinner
he
announced
you
too
i
have
made
her
your
excuses
because
i
have
a
money
matter
to
discuss
that
should
not
be
postponed
you
have
my
deepest
sympathy
i
answered
and
left
him
as
puzzled
to
know
what
i
meant
as
i
was
something
was
whispering
over
and
over
in
my
ear--work
work
work
and
whispering
in
the
imperative
mood
i
determined
to
call
upon
captain
weldon
and
procure
from
him
my
manuscript
at
once
i
remembered
he
lived
in
jermyn
street
i
walked
thither
as
fast
as
i
was
able
chapter
xiii
hubbard
is
jealous
i
encountered
the
captain
on
his
doorstep
he
was
just
going
out
hatted
and
gloved
but
on
seeing
me
he
abandoned
his
intention
his
delight
was
that
of
a
child
and
so
manifestly
genuine
so
transparently
sincere
that
it
warmed
my
heart
he
dragged
me
into
his
sitting-room
and
wrung
my
hands
again
and
again
expressing
his
pleasure
in
tones
that
made
the
windows
rattle
one
cannot
help
liking
a
man
so
simple
and
at
the
same
time
so
kind
there
are
too
many
complex
people
in
the
world
he
had
grieved
for
my
supposed
loss
more
than
at
his
own
brother's
death
he
said
and
i
believed
him
very
few
men
care
much
for
their
brothers
then
he
told
me
all
about
his
approaching
marriage
it
was
to
take
place
in
five
weeks
and
he
was
dreading
the
ordeal
already
he
had
just
finished
furnishing
his
wexford
country
house
from
top
to
bottom
they
were
to
settle
there
after
a
honeymoon
in
italy
and
adopt
the
life
and
manners
of
country
magnates
only
coming
to
town
for
the
season
it
was
miss
ottley's
desire
she
did
not
care
for
london
smart
society
it
seemed
and
although
he
did
he
was
quite
willing
to
give
it
up
or
anything
else
indeed
to
please
her
it
was
pleasant
to
hear
him
rhapsodise
concerning
her
and
to
watch
his
happy
face
its
spirit
made
him
ten
times
handsomer
and
although
his
speech
was
boyish
it
did
not
detract
him
from
his
exuberant
virility
he
was
a
man
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
soles
of
his
feet--a
splendid
animal
with
just
enough
brains
to
be
a
force
to
command
respect
and
a
heart
big
enough
to
fill
the
whole
world
with
his
affection
there
was
not
a
single
bitter
drop
in
the
cup
of
his
happiness
he
was
about
to
marry
the
woman
he
adored
he
was
enormously
wealthy
and
his
wife-to-be
was
the
only
daughter
of
a
millionaire
his
plans
for
the
future
were
utopian
he
dreamed
of
enlarging
his
estates
and
providing
for
at
least
the
welfare
of
a
hundred
families
wealth
was
given
one
in
trust
for
others
he
declared
and
he
was
resolved
to
make
every
one
around
him
happy
and
contented
as
a
wedding
present
to
his
tenants
he
had
already
ordered
the
rebuilding
of
their
homes
and
cottages
on
a
scale
of
almost
lavish
grandeur
each
farmhouse
would
be
a
model
of
luxury
each
labourer's
cottage
would
be
a
miniature
castle
with
tiled
walls
and
hot
and
cold
water
attachments
other
landlords
were
annoyed
with
him
and
had
not
hesitated
to
express
their
resentment
he
was
spoiling
his
own
tenants
and
making
them
dissatisfied
they
said
but
the
captain
asked
me
with
eyes
aglow
how
could
one
want
to
keep
all
the
good
things
of
life
to
benefit
a
single
class
it
was
monstrous
impossible
absurd
he
only
wished
he
could
at
one
stroke
make
all
the
poor
in
the
world
comfortable
you
ought
to
hear
may
on
the
subject
he
cried
out
in
a
burst
of
confidence
you'd
think
she
was
a
socialist
but
she
is
only
an
angel
thence
he
wandered
to
her
father
sir
robert
had
given
up
all
his
old
stupid
ways
he
had
reformed
and
was
as
sane
as
any
man
in
england
he
had
repudiated
his
ancient
attachment
to
spooks
and
spirit-rapping
and
mahatmas
and
had
sent
his
famous
medium
navarro
to
the
right
about
much
to
that
gentleman's
disgust
and
indignation
sir
robert
was
now
engaged
with
dr
belleville
in
compiling
a
history
of
the
dynasty
from
papyri
they
had
found
in
the
tomb
of
ptahmes
the
captain
still
thought
that
ottley
had
treated
me
very
badly
but
he
begged
me
to
forgive
the
old
man
as
he
had
evidently
not
been
quite
in
his
mind
at
the
time
you
excited
his
professional
jealousy
don't
you
know
old
chap
said
weldon
sir
robert
has
one
fault--he
is
dreadfully
vain
and
he
wanted
to
get
all
the
credit
out
of
his
discovery
he
told
me
so
himself
he
quite
opened
up
to
me
on
the
voyage
home
a
vision
of
sir
robert
ottley
opening
up
to
the
captain
occurred
to
me
the
little
old
inscrutable
shut-in
face
of
the
baronet
peering
slyly
into
the
frank
and
unsuspicious
countenance
of
the
handsome
simple-minded
guardsman
and
making
a
confession
of
his
faults
the
while
for
why
i
could
not
guess
but
i
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
for
no
straightforward
purpose
we
dined
together
and
while
we
ate
i
questioned
him
about
dr
belleville
for
the
first
time
i
saw
a
shade
on
his
face
he
did
not
like
the
doctor
i
pursued
the
investigation
for
a
while
he
fenced
with
my
questions
but
finally
it
all
came
out
i
have
an
idea
said
he
that
belleville
annoys
may
he
is
in
love
with
her
of
course
one
can't
blame
him
for
that
but
as
a
guest
in
her
father's
house
and
her
father's
closest
friend
he
has
opportunities
to
force
his
attentions
and
i
believe
the
brute
abuses
them
she
does
not
complain
and
will
tell
me
nothing--but
all
the
same
i
have
my
opinion
you
see
she
worships
her
father
so
much
that
she
will
run
no
risk
of
hurting
his
feelings
she
would
put
up
with
almost
anything
rather
than
distress
him
and
belleville
knows
it
he
has
sir
robert
under
his
thumb
far
more
than
i
like
i
hate
to
think
i
may
be
wronging
the
fellow--but
upon
my
soul
i
cannot
help
distrusting
him
but
you
have
nothing
definite
to
go
upon
nothing--except
this
one
day
about
two
weeks
ago
i
went
in
unannounced
and
found
her--in
tears
i
had
passed
belleville
in
the
hall
a
second
earlier
he
looked
as
black
as
night
and
she--well
she
told
me
weeping
that
she
would
marry
me
when
i
pleased
up
till
then
she
had
always
put
off
naming
the
day
what
would
you
make
of
it
pinsent
what
did
you
i
concluded
that
he
had
been
persecuting
her
and
that--well
that
she
felt
safer
with
me
than
with
her
father
don't
rag
me
for
being
vain
old
chap
if
you'd
seen
her
cry
she
is
not
that
sort
of
a
girl
either
it
was
the
first
time
i
ever
knew
her
to
break
down
and
i've
known
her
all
my
life
did
you
speak
to
belleville
about
it
she
forbade
me
to--but
all
the
same
i
did
i
behaved
like
an
idiot
of
course
lost
my
temper
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
he
was
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
he
denied
nothing
and
admitted
nothing
he
pretended
to
think
i
had
been
drinking
and
that
enraged
me
the
more
i
was
fool
enough
to
strike
him
he
got
all
the
best
of
it
he
picked
himself
up
smiling
sweetly
and
said
that
nothing
could
induce
him
to
resent
anything
addressed
by
a
person
in
whom
miss
ottley
was
interested
the
inference
was
that
he
loved
her
in
an
infinitely
superior
way
to
me
i
felt
like
choking
him
for
a
bit
and
would
you
believe
it--he
actually
offered
to
shake
hands
a
dangerous
man
my
lad
beware
of
him
he
gives
me
the
creeps
said
the
captain
but
let's
talk
of
something
else
pleasanter
we
talked
of
miss
ottley
or
rather
he
did
while
i
listened
till
midnight
then
he
strolled
with
me
to
bruton
street
and
we
parted
at
dixon
hubbard's
doorstep
as
the
clocks
were
striking
one
i
found
hubbard
seated
before
the
fire
smoking
and
staring
dreamily
up
at
a
portrait
of
his
wife
that
rested
on
the
mantel
i've
found
out
why
i
married
her
pinsent
he
said
slowly
it
was
to
benefit
a
jew
named
maurice
levi--the
most
awful
bounder
in
london
she
had
been
borrowing
from
him
at
twenty-five
per
cent
to
pay
some
of
her
brother's
gambling
debts
levi
wanted
to
marry
her
and
would
have
too
if
i
had
not
stepped
in
to
save
him
she
is
the
dearest
little
woman
in
the
world
she
shed
some
tears
they
cost
me
about
a
thousand
pounds
apiece
good-night
dixon
i
said
gently
tears
idle
tears
he
murmured
the
poet
mark
you
did
not
speak
of
woman's
tears
then
he
closed
his
eyes
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
you
find
me
changed
pinsent
a
little
for
better
or
worse
be
frank
with
me
for
the
better
this
afternoon
for
the
first
time
in
our
acquaintance
i
beheld
you
in
a
lady's
drawing-room
you
are
growing
tolerant
of
your
kind
i
am
no
longer
a
misanthrope
but
i
am
rapidly
becoming
a
misogynist
yes
i
am
altered
old
friend
greatly
altered
at
the
bottom
of
my
former
misanthropy
was
a
diseased
conviction
born
of
vanity
that
i
was
the
only
person
in
the
world
really
worth
thinking
badly
about
but
marriage
has
compelled
me
to
think
more
badly
still
of
somebody
else
the
less
selfish
outlook
thus
induced
has
broadened
my
mind
i
begin
to
look
forward
to
a
time
when
my
perversion
will
be
complete
and
i
shall
be
able
without
blushing
to
look
any
woman
in
the
face
and
acknowledge
her
superiority
in
innate
viciousness
i
begin
to
pity
your
wife
dixon
a
waste
of
sentiment
she
has
married
five
and
twenty
thousand
pounds
per
annum
and
she
would
be
the
last
to
tell
you
that
the
institution
is
a
failure
few
women
contrive
to
dispose
as
advantageously
of
the
sort
of
goods
they
have
to
sell
lady
helen
would
have
made
a
fortune
as
a
bagman
but
there
i
do
not
want
to
prejudice
you
against
her
she
likes
you
i
believe
perhaps--who
knows--but
there--good-night
i
was
glad
to
get
away
chapter
xiv
the
pushful
man
a
day
or
two
afterwards
while
spending
an
hour
in
the
rooms
of
the
egyptology
society
i
was
introduced
to
a
new
fellow
who
had
been
appointed
during
my
absence
from
england
his
name
was
louis
coen
he
was
in
private
life
a
broker
but
his
heart
and
soul
were
wrapped
in
the
cause
he
evidently
spelt
it
with
a
capital
in
sympathy
perhaps
with
the
vast
sums
in
cash
he
had
already
put
at
the
disposal
of
the
society
for
exploration
work
he
was
intensely
entertaining
he
took
me
aside
and
confided
that
it
was
his
ambition
to
transform
the
society
into
a
sort
of
club
we
needed
a
liquor
license
and
more
commodious
premises
it
seemed
then
we
would
boom
he
offered
to
provide
all
the
money
requisite
and
he
begged
me
to
use
my
influence
with
other
members
to
get
his
views
adopted
he
was
one
of
those
men
whose
mission
in
life
is
to
run
every
concern
into
which
they
can
manage
to
insinuate
themselves
i
was
afraid
i
disappointed
him
although
i
did
my
best
to
be
polite
but
he
was
nothing
daunted
he
declared
he
would
galvanise
the
old
fogies
into
fresh
activity
and
make
us
see
things
from
his
point
of
view
or
die
in
the
attempt
we
might
be
as
serious
as
we
pleased
but
he
would
force
us
to
be
sociable
he
had
a
nose
like
a
parrot
and
was
already
on
the
committee
of
management
he
even
proposed
to
change
our
name
the
royal
egyptian
club
seemed
to
him
a
real
smart
monniker
he
saved
me
from
an
impending
mental
and
physical
collapse
by
mentioning
the
name
of
sir
robert
ottley
ottley
it
appeared
was
his
latest
convert
ottley
agreed
with
him
that
we
wanted
new
blood
that
our
methods
were
too
conservative
ottley
thought
it
was
ridiculous
that
everything
a
member
did
or
discovered
should
have
to
be
reported
to
and
judged
about
by
a
lot
of
old
fossils
what
right
had
those
old
stick-at-homes
to
appropriate
the
credit
of
the
exertions
of
the
energetic
would
you
believe
it
cried
mr
coen
they
have
had
the
impudence
to
demand
from
him
an
account
of
his
recent
find--the
tomb
of
an
old
johnny
named
ptahmes--which
he
unearthed
at
his
own
expense
entirely
they
have
had
the
'hide'
to
insist
that
he
shall
immediately
hand
over
the
mummy
to
the
british
museum
and
place
the
papyri
before
them--them--them--for
the
purpose
of
translation
et-cetera
i
never
heard
a
more
cheeky
proposition
in
my
life
my
friend
ottley
would
act
rightly
if
he
told
them
to
go
to
the
deuce
what
has
he
told
them
i
inquired
oh
he
is
temporising
he
has
written
to
say
that
he
will
place
his
discoveries
at
their
disposal
when
he
has
satisfied
himself
of
their
authenticity
et-cetera
of
course
that's
all
'gyver'
the
mummy
is
genuine
enough
so
are
the
papyri
but
he
naturally
wants
to
have
first
'go'
at
them
and
he
is
fighting
for
time
meanwhile
i
am
organising
the
progressives
we
can
never
hope
to
get
this
show
properly
on
the
move
till
we
shake
things
up
and
reform
on
sound
commercial
lines
i
tell
you
sir
before
i've
done
with
it
i'll
make
this
society
a
power
in
the
land
i'm
going
to
take
it
up
in
both
hands
and
chuck
it
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
b
p
that
means
the
british
public
and
you
take
it
from
me
it's
going
to
stay
there
good-day
to
you
i'm
glad
to
have
met
you
you
are
a
bit
antiquated
in
your
notions
but
you're
a
young
man
yet
and
you'll
find
you'll
have
to
join
my
crowd
s'long
he
shook
my
hand
very
energetically
and
bustled
off
i
sank
into
a
chair
and
began
to
fan
myself
a
moment
later
the
president
lord
ballantine
entered
the
room
the
poor
old
gentleman
was
purple
in
the
face
spluttering
has-has-has
that
man
coen
been
can-can-canvassing
you
he
thundered
i
nodded
i-i-i'll
resign--by
god
cried
lord
ballantine
it-it-it's
too
much
i-i-i
he
stopped----gasping
for
a
word
the
picture
of
impotent
rage
and
misery
but
i
felt
no
sympathy
for
him
why
did
you
let
him
in
i
asked
we-we-we
were
short
of
funds
and
now
he's
bought
us
or
thinks
he
has
body
and
soul
who
nominated
him
ottley
i
was
not
surprised
to
hear
it
he--he's
ottley's
broker
ottley
and
he
are
running
the
market-change--together
have
you
heard
they
have
cornered
south
africans
they
made
half
a
million
between
them
yesterday
all
london
is
talking
about
it
and
they
want
to
turn
us
into
a
beer
garden
you'll
have
to
turn
them
out
how
can
we
we
owe
them
lord
knows
how
much
then
if
you
cannot
i
said
calmly
rising
as
i
spoke
you'll
have
to
grin
and
bear
the
infliction
you
have
brought
upon
yourselves
after
all
it's
a
question
of
voting
you'll
stand
by
us
pinsent
he
implored
my
resignation
is
at
any
time
at
your
disposal
ballantine
all
the
same
i
don't
pity
you
a
scrap
you
are
getting
little
more
than
you
deserve
i
have
been
working
for
three
years
for
the
society
without
remuneration
and
i
am
a
poor
man
many
of
your
older
members
are
as
rich
as
croesus
and
yet
you
must
needs
import
a
vulgar
semitic
broker
to
help
you
out
of
a
hole
good-afternoon
i
left
the
poor
old
fellow
helpless
and
speechless
staring
after
me
with
anguished
eyes
and
mouth
agape
that
evening
i
received
a
letter
from
louis
coen
offering
to
finance
my
book
on
the
nile
monuments
he
said
he
felt
sure
it
would
prove
a
work
of
rare
educational
value
and
on
that
account
he
was
willing
to
furnish
every
library
in
the
english-speaking
world
with
a
free
copy
aware
however
that
i
was
not
a
business
man
he
would
conduct
all
the
business
arrangements
himself
on
receipt
of
the
manuscript
therefore
he
would
forward
me
a
cheque
for
â£1000
as
an
instalment
in
advance
of
my
share
of
the
profits--fifteen
per
cent
he
proposed
to
allow
me--and
he
wound
up
as
follows
your
acceptance
of
my
offer
will
commit
you
to
nothing
as
regards
our
chat
of
this
morning
my
good
friend
sir
robert
ottley
put
me
up
to
this
venture
he
has
the
brightest
opinion
of
your
ability
and
he
is
sure
your
book
will
prove
a
success
i
am
going
blind
on
his
say
so
let
me
have
an
answer
right
away
i
thought
a
good
deal
over
this
precious
epistle
but
in
the
end
i
did
not
see
why
i
should
not
make
a
little
money
i
knew
very
well
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
make
â£100
let
alone
a
thousand
out
of
the
nile
monuments
but
i
felt
little
doubt
that
mr
coen
had
a
plan
to
make
even
more--somehow
or
other
but
i
had
done
the
man
injustice--it
was
not
money
he
was
after
reading
the
times
two
mornings
later
i
came
upon
the
following
announcement
a
patron
of
learning
we
are
informed
that
mr
louis
coen
f
r
e
s
has
induced
the
well-known
egyptologist
dr
hugh
pinsent
to
commit
the
results
of
his
recent
archã¦ological
researches
on
the
nile
to
the
enduring
care
of
the
printer's
ink
mr
coen
has
purchased
the
rights
in
advance
for
a
large
sum
of
the
projected
volume
which
it
is
said
will
take
the
form
of
an
exhaustive
treatise
on
the
nile
monuments
it
is
not
however
mr
coen's
object
to
direct
his
enterprise
to
his
own
financial
benefit
it
is
his
intention
to
produce
a
splendidly
illustrated
edition
of
the
book
for
presentation
to
educational
establishments
all
over
the
united
kingdom
in
the
hope
of
thus
fixing
public
attention
upon
the
enormous
historical
importance
of
the
work
now
being
carried
on
by
the
royal
egyptologist
society
of
which
society
mr
coen
is
a
member
and
a
generous
supporter
mr
coen
is
to
be
congratulated
upon
his
latest
effort
in
the
interest
of
popular
education
it
will
be
remembered
that
last
year
he
endowed
a
chair
in
the
university
of
newcome
for
study
of
the
ancient
egyptian
tongue
but
it
may
be
confidently
expected
that
his
exploitation
of
dr
pinsent's
history
will
go
much
further
in
popularising
a
subject
which
is
now
practically
confined
to
the
ranks
of
leisured
scholars
it
was
not
pleasant
to
think
that
i
had
been
idiot
enough
to
allow
mr
coen
to
use
me
as
a
stepping-stone
to
notoriety
but
it
was
too
late
to
object
the
thing
was
done
my
consolation
was
a
bigger
banking
account
than
i
had
had
for
years
not
even
the
fact
that
during
the
day
i
received
a
score
of
sarcastic
congratulatory
telegrams
from
members
of
the
society
could
rob
me
of
that
satisfaction
but
i
sent
in
my
resignation
all
the
same
i
felt
that
i
had
no
right
to
belong
to
any
institution
run
by
mr
coen
i
might
meet
him
there--and
if
i
did
a
police
court
case
of
assault
and
battery
would
infallibly
result
chapter
xv
a
quaint
love
pact
one
evening
after
a
hard
morning's
work
on
my
book
and
a
particularly
fatiguing
afternoon
spent
in
vainly
trying
to
lift
hubbard
out
of
a
funereal
mood
i
thought
i
should
make
myself
a
present
of
a
few
minutes'
conversation
with
miss
ottley
i
argued
that
she
would
be
sure
to
spend
the
evening
out
somewhere
so
i
knocked
at
her
father's
door
a
few
minutes
before
eight
o'clock
a
gloomy-looking
footman
opened
the
door
yes
miss
ottley
was
at
home
he
would
give
her
my
card
would
i
wait
i
would
though
i
wondered
i
heard
dr
belleville's
voice
it
issued
from
a
room
that
opened
on
the
hall
he
was
talking
shrilly
as
though
he
were
angered
and
in
french
perhaps
to
spare
the
feelings
of
the
servants
he
kept
repeating
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
and
that
he
would
not
wait
another
day
for
god
almighty
all
of
a
sudden
the
door
opened
and
he
stalked
out
looking
like
the
baffled
villain
in
a
melodrama
we
came
face
to
face
he
stopped
dead
and
glared
at
me
you
he
gasped
what
are
you
doing
here
what
do
you
want
i
glanced
beyond
him
and
saw
miss
ottley
he
had
been
speaking
to
her
then
and
like
that
my
blood
began
to
boil
i
advanced
upon
him
trying
to
smile
i
had
seen
miss
ottley's
face
i
want
you
to
go
right
back
into
that
room
and
pretend
you
are
a
gentleman
i
said
the
girl
had
put
a
kerchief
to
her
eyes
quickly
i
added
dr
belleville
returned
into
the
room
i
followed
and
closed
the
door
dr
pinsent----
he
began
as
i
turned
but
i
cut
him
short
on
your
knees
i
commanded
he
went
livid
dr
pinsent
said
miss
ottley
i
beg
you
not
to
interfere
you
will
only
make
it
the
harder
for
me
she
might
as
well
have
spoken
to
a
fence
i
never
took
my
eyes
from
belleville
you
know
what
you
ought
to
do
i
murmured
if
you
compel
me
to
teach
you
you'll
repent
the
object
lesson
in
a
hospital
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
girl
i
apologise
he
groaned
out
in
a
choking
voice
i
bowed
him
out
of
the
room
as
deferentially
as
if
he
were
a
woman
he
vanished
silently
miss
ottley
was
dressed
for
the
opera
you
are
going
out
i
asked
y-yes
she
said
she
was
powdering
her
face
before
a
mirror
to
the
opera
yes
to
meet
there
mrs
austin
dare
you
walk
there--with
me
for
a
companion
oh
yes
she
said
a
moment
later
we
found
ourselves
in
curzon
street
she
took
my
arm
we
walked
for
two
blocks
in
absolute
silence
save
that
every
now
and
then
she
choked
back
a
sob
she
was
her
own
mistress
again
at
length
however
why
did
you
come--of
all
times
to-night
she
asked
i
do
not
know
did
you
wish
to
see
my
father
no
you
why
i
had
a
subconscious
conviction
that
you
might
be
needing
me
truly
she
cried--and
pressed
my
arm
that
or
something
else
at
any
rate
i
felt
obliged
to
call
it
may
have
been
from
a
desire
to
reassure
myself
about
the
colour
of
your
eyes
ah
i
suppose
you
are
wondering--because--dr
belleville--because--i----
she
paused
i
am
human
i
observed
i
want
you
to
forget
it
will
you
dr
pinsent
on
the
spot
that
is
good
of
you
her
tone
was
crisp
with
disappointment
you
are
indeed
a
friend
but
not
in
need
a
friend
eh
come
come
miss
ottley
you
are
in
trouble
i
am
strong
and
trustworthy
and
capable
there
are
times
when
a
man
may
tell
the
truth
about
himself
and
this
i
think
is
one
of
them
can
i
help
you
no
one
can
help
me
she
said
sadly
you
least
of
all
and
why
least
of
all
because
you
hate
my
father
is
he
in
trouble
too
he
is
the
willing
but
unwitting
victim
of
a
wicked
wicked
man--but
oh
what
am
i
saying
dr
pinsent
please
please
let
us
talk
of
something
else
you
are
trembling--may
oh
she
said--and
looked
at
me
it
slipped
out--unconsciously
i
stammered
i
did
not
mean
to
be
impertinent
i
think
of
you--by
that
name
is
it
impertinent
to
think----
no
no
then
you'll
forgive
me
what
is
there
to
forgive
all
that
the
circumstance
implies
come
after
all
i
am
not
sorry
for
the
slip
why
should
i
twist
its
meaning
either
like
a
coward
it
is
only
the
weak
who
need
the
shelter
of
hypocrisy
look
straight
before
you--may--and
do
not
turn
your
eyes
may
again
you
see
you
have
something
to
tell
me
she
said
gravely
the
old
old
story
may
i
answered
with
a
short
but
reckless
laugh
should
you--dr
pinsent--do
you
think
yes
because
the
husband
you
have
chosen
is
a
gallant
fellow
and
my
friend
i
am
too
fond
of
him
to
wish
to
do
him
an
ill
turn
even
in
my
own
adventure
why
look
you
may
were
you
to
turn
to
me
and
say
'i
love
you
hugo
pinsent'
i
would
answer
'yes--and
we
both
love
frankfort
weldon'
yes
said
miss
ottley
she
stopped
and
we
looked
deep
into
each
other's
eyes
yes
she
said
again
and
we
both
love
frankfort
weldon
god
help
us
i
exclaimed
it
is
a
good
prayer
god
will
hear
it
she
said
softly
what
made
you
i
asked
a
little
later
we
were
walking
on
again--but
now
apart
you
she
said
it
is
very
wonderful
and
sad
said
she
but
grand
and
beautiful
i
shall
not
go
to
the
opera
to-night
she
said
will
you
put
me
in
a
cab
you
will
go
home
yes
and
belleville
he
will
be
at
work
i
shall
not
see
him
he
threatened
you
not
me
but
captain
weldon
he
demands
that
i
shall
marry
him
my
father
also
wishes
it
you
see
i
tell
you
everything--now
you
will
help
me
will
you
not
of
course
but
you
must
teach
me
how
in
what
fashion
does
belleville
threaten
weldon
he
vows--that
unless
i
do
as
he
demands
within
this
week--captain
weldon
will
be
found
dead
in
his
bed
murder
i
cried
he
does
not
scruple
to
conceal
the
fact
he
declares
he
has
nothing
to
fear
he
pretends
to
possess
a
secret
which
gives
him
as
great
a
power
over
life
and
death
as
providence
an
esoteric
power
of
course
it
is
connected
with
the
discovery
of
ptahmes
he
claims
to
have
already
tested
it
my
father
has
used
it
in
other
ways
he
has
been
experimenting
on
the
stock
exchange
in
ten
days
he
has
already
doubled
his
fortune
surely
of
that
you
must
have
heard
i
have
heard
that
he
has
been
speculating
with
extravagant
success
but
that
his
luck
was
due
to
supernatural
agency
i
decline
to
believe
in
my
opinion
belleville
is
simply
putting
up
a
scoundrelly
game
of
bluff
i
wish
i
could
think
so
too
but
i
cannot
but
my
dear
girl
consider
the
probabilities
belleville's
story
belongs
to
the
middle
ages
yes--but
he
believes
it
i
am
as
sure
of
that
as
that
i
live
and
is
that
a
reason
why
you
should
believe
it
too
the
man
is
perhaps
a
lunatic
ah
she
said
i
knew
that
you
would
take
this
view
that
was
partly
why
i
felt
you
could
not
help
me
but
her
distress
cut
me
to
the
quick
it
does
not
matter
what
view
i
take
i
muttered
hastily
i'll
do
anything
you
wish
anything
did
you
doubt
it
no
then----
then
go
and
stay
with
captain
weldon
he
will
welcome
you
for
he
likes
you
out
of
mention
spend
the
week
with
him
do
not
let
him
from
your
sight
at
night
especially
guard
him
while
he
sleeps
is
it
too
much
to
ask
no
there
is
a
cab--stop
it
please
thanks
now
say
good-bye
to
me
good-bye--may
i
helped
her
into
the
vehicle
would
it
be
permissible
to
kiss
your
hand
no
she
said
but
give
me
yours
i
felt
her
lips
upon
my
fingers
and
with
a
sort
of
groan
i
snatched
them
away
from
her
grasp
that
was
our
good-bye
chapter
xvi
lady
helen
prescribes
for
her
husband
next
morning
early
i
picked
a
quarrel
with
hubbard
and
left
him
biting
his
finger
nails
i
went
straight
to
jermyn
street
with
my
valise
weldon
was
in
bed
i
told
him
i
had
had
a
fight
with
hubbard
and
asked
to
be
put
up
for
a
few
days
he
agreed
with
acclamation
though
i
am
sure
he
was
perfectly
astounded
at
my
strange
request
i
proceeded
to
astound
him
further
i
mendaciously
informed
him
that
my
nerves
were
in
rags
and
that
i
was
obsessed
with
a
horrible
hallucination
of
a
mysteriously
threatened
life
at
night
would
then
he
give
me
a
shakedown
in
his
own
bedroom
just
for
a
week
it
is
wonderful
how
easy
lying
comes
to
one
after
the
first
plunge
i
did
the
thing
thoroughly
mind
you
i
felt
all
along
the
utmost
scorn
for
dr
belleville's
threats
against
young
weldon's
life
but
miss
ottley
had
asked
me
to
look
after
him
and
i
was
determined
to
fulfil
the
trust
to
the
very
foot
of
the
letter
he
was
a
splendid
fellow
to
live
with
it
gives
me
a
heartache
to
remember
the
anxiety
to
make
me
comfortable
the
almost
absurd
cordiality
of
his
welcome
the
unselfish
sincerity
of
his
desire
to
please
one
would
have
thought
me
a
superior
creation
a
sort
of
divinity
in
disguise
the
way
he
treated
me
i
had
never
awakened
such
affection
in
any
living
thing
before
except
in
a
mongrel
retriever
which
once
upon
a
time
followed
me
home
and
which
i
had
to
turn
away
after
it
had
licked
my
hand
and
the
amazing
thing
was
i
had
done
nothing
in
the
world
to
deserve
it
i
had
never
put
myself
out
of
my
way
in
the
smallest
particular
to
serve
the
captain
when
we
first
met
i
had
treated
him
with
the
scantest
courtesy
and
afterwards
with
a
sort
of
good-natured
contempt
even
now
i
cannot
understand
it
properly
it
may
have
arisen
from
a
secret
disposition
to
hero-worship
some
men
are
like
that
they
are
fond
of
investing
a
sentient
figure-head
with
exaggerated
attributes
of
majesty
and
bowing
down
before
it
it
is
the
survival
of
an
aboriginal
instinct
to
glorify
the
insubordinate
weldon
admired
two
things
above
all
others
strength
of
body
and
strength
of
mind
in
both
these
gifts
he
felt
himself
inferior
to
me
therefore
he
must
needs
put
me
on
a
pedestal
his
gratitude
in
finding
me
willing
to
stoop
to
ask
a
favour
of
him
was
unbounded
it
resembled
that
of
an
eton
fag
to
a
monitor
kind
enough
to
take
an
interest
in
his
doings
i
have
said
before
that
he
was
essentially
a
boy
at
heart
but
what
an
honest
clean-minded
fresh
wholehearted
boy
i
found
myself
liking
and
admiring
him
more
and
more
each
day
he
taught
me
one
of
the
greatest
truths
a
man
may
learn
it
is
this--there
is
a
more
admirable
thing
in
the
world
than
intellect
weldon's
intellect
was
not
of
the
first
order
that
is
why
i
began
by
very
nearly
despising
him
but
he
was
the
straightest
truest
manliest
and
simplest-minded
man
i
have
ever
met
and
i
ended
by
half-humorously
but
none
the
less
sincerely
reverencing
him
if
it
were
only
for
his
sake
i
shall
while
i
live
regard
the
highest
type
of
brain
as
incomplete
without
a
paramount
ideal
of
morality
and
the
best
thing
about
weldon
was
that
he
was
utterly
unconscious
of
his
goodness
he
was
perfectly
incapable
of
posing
but
he
had
a
fine
robust
vanity
of
sorts
and
he
liked
to
regard
himself
as
a
bit
of
a
sad
dog
romance
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
he
envied
the
more
than
questionable
experience
of
some
of
his
acquaintances
it
was
because
of
the
glamour
of
their
perfumed
wickedness
but
their
callous
self-extrication
from
entanglements
after
growing
weary
of
their
chains
made
him
long
to
wring
their
necks
for
his
own
part
a
certain
shop
girl
had
once
fallen
in
love
with
him
he
twirled
his
moustache
and
cast
furtive
glances
at
the
mirror
near
him
it
appears
he
had
dallied
with
the
temptation
for
a
while--the
sad
dog--but
miss
ottley's
portrait
had
saved
him
he
had
kissed
the
shop
girl
once--horror
of
horrors--in
the
park
after
dark
he
apologised
to
her
father
with
a
thousand
pounds
and
fled
to
south
america
when
he
came
back
she
was
married
he
had
confessed
the
whole
of
his
truly
dreadful
criminality
to
miss
ottley
in
a
letter--and
she
had
kept
him
waiting
three
miserable
days
for
a
reply
he
believed
he
would
have
gone
to
the
dogs
headlong
if
she
had
refused
to
pardon
him
but
she
did
not
vanity
told
him
the
reason
but
it
was
beautiful
to
see
the
colour
flush
his
cheeks
and
his
eyes
sparkle
as
he
protested
that
he
couldn't
understand
why
she
ever
brought
herself
to
speak
to
him
again
i
believe
that
was
as
far
as
weldon
ever
got
to
telling
a
downright
falsehood
the
dear
great
gander
on
the
third
afternoon
of
my
stay
at
jermyn
street
i
was
busily
at
work
writing
when
a
knock
sounded
weldon
was
out
he
had
gone
to
take
miss
ottley
for
a
drive
in
his
newest
dogcart
his
man
too
had
a
day
off
so
i
was
quite
alone
i
said
come
in
and
there
entered
lady
helen--hubbard's
wife
she
was
a
vision
of
lace
fripperies
and
arch
mincing
daintiness
so
run
to
earth
she
cried
i
sprang
up
and
offered
her
a
chair
she
settled
into
it
with
a
swish
and
a
sigh
been
searching
for
you
everywhere
i
had
thought
of
applying
to
the
police
i
suppose
i
looked
astonished
for
she
laughed
i
stammered
why
have
you
been
searching
for
me
she
gave
me
a
glance
of
scorn
should
a
dutiful
wife
regard
with
indifference
the
sudden
desertion
of
her
husband
by
the
only
friend
he
possesses
just
tell
me
that
you
take
my
breath
away
no
she
flashed
the
'dutiful
wife'
did
that
confess
well
since
you
insist--i
admit
that
helen
becomes
you
better
than
joan
i
said
audaciously
her
eyes
glittered
may
be
my
fine
gentleman--but
would
you
say
'dixon'
was
synonymous
with
'darby'
not
quite
still
they
both
commence
with
a
'd'
that
is
something
eh
so
does
another
word
which
rhymes
with
lamb
she
retorted
cuttingly
oh
i
might
have
known
that
you
would
take
his
part
you
men
always
stick
together
i
beg
your
pardon
lady
helen
i
consider
that
you
deserve
well
of
your
country
you
have
improved
hubbard
past
belief
he
is
worth
improving
she
smiled
i
have
humanised
him
just
a
little
don't
you
think
i
nodded
she
leaned
forward
suddenly
and
looked
me
in
the
eye
it's
only
the
commencement
the
thin
edge
of
the
wedge
oh
she
began
speaking
through
her
teeth
i'll
make
a
man
of
him
yet
if
i
have
to
beggar
him
in
the
process
i
beg
you
to
excuse
me
she
fell
back
and
began
to
laugh
oh
how
solemn
you
are
you
disapprove
of
me
ha
ha
ha
you
don't
even
begin
to
hide
it
you
see
i
do
not
understand
you
yet
you
disapprove
no
i
wonder
you
are
a
man
doctor
that
one
can't
help
trusting
she
stood
up
and
began
to
move
about
the
room
i
am
going
to
confide
in
you
she
announced
stopping
suddenly
a
dangerous
experiment
i
observed
one
risks
death
every
time
one
crosses
a
car-crowded
thoroughfare
i'll
take
the
risk
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
she
frowned
you
used
to
like
me
once
what
stopped
you
i
haven't
stopped
she
smiled
bewitchingly
and
gliding
forward
placed
her
hand
upon
my
arm
he
wanted
to
take
me
away
to
south
america--he
owns
a
ranch
there--and
to
bury
us
two
for
ever
from
the
world
that
was
his
idea
of
marriage
it
all
came
of
a
rooted
disbelief
in
his
own
ability
to
keep
me
interested
in
himself
while
i
possessed
an
opportunity
to
contrast
him
with
his
social
equals
he
saw
a
rival
in
every
man
i
looked
at
or
who
looked
at
me
he
should
have
been
born
a
turk
i
should
then
have
been
the
queen
of
his
zenana
but
no
i
must
do
him
justice--he
is
not
polygamously
inclined
still
he
would
have
shut
me
up
the
poor
devil
i
muttered
it
is
his
disposition
he
cannot
help
himself
but
he
may
be
cured
of
it
said
lady
helen
he
thinks
every
woman
is
a
rake
at
heart
but
he
is
mad
i
for
one
am
not
mind
you
i
love
society
i
like
men
i
live
for
admiration
but
as
to--pshaw--she
spread
out
her
hands
you
quarrelled
i
inquired
no
we
argued
the
matter
out
and
came
to
an
arrangement
we
are
good
friends
but
he
does
not
conceal
his
opinion
that
some
day
or
another
i
will
go
to
the
devil
he
thinks
it
inevitable
pride
however
forbids
him
from
looking
on
except
at
a
distance
that
is
why
he
separated
from
me
he
imagines
that
no
woman
can
keep
true
to
one
man
unless
she
is
immured
the
fool
the
utter
fool
as
if
walls
and
locks
and
keys
were
ever
an
encumbrance
love
is
the
only
solid
guarantee
of
a
woman's
faith
but
my
dear
lady
helen
your
husband
has
not
the
faintest
idea
that
you
love
him
she
drew
back
gasping
you--you--you
she
cried
she
was
scarlet
then
she
said
how
dare
you
she
looked
so
lovely
that
i
no
longer
wondered
at
hubbard's
infatuation
you
should
not
have
kept
it
from
him
i
said
severely
but
there
it's
wonderful
how
did
you
ever
manage
it
he
is
not
an
attractive
man
and
you--a
butterfly
it
is
a
miracle
there
must
be
depths
in
you
are
marriages
made
in
heaven
i
thought--he
thinks--you
married
him
for
his
money
and
you
love
him
i
shall
never
get
over
this
lady
helen
you
are
a
most
amazing
woman
she
rushed
at
me
panting
with
rage
and
seizing
my
arm
shook
it
with
both
hands
if
ever
you
tell
him--i'll--i'll
kill
you
she
hissed
but
why
he
must
find
out
himself
he
must
suffer
he
deserves
it
he
has
bitterly
insulted
me
he
has
shamed
my
sex
he
must
gnaw
out
his
heart
in
no
other
way
can
he
be
made
like
other
men
i'll
teach
him
i'll
teach
him
oh
if
you
dare
to
interfere
but
you
shan't--you
would
not
dare
no
i
said
i
would
not
dare
next
second
she
was
in
another
mood
her
anger
melted
to
pathos
and
the
little
siren
began
to
plead
to
me
you
know
what
i
really
want
you
to
do
is
to
help
me
she
murmured
oh
so
prettily
and
it
is
all
for
dixon's
sake
or
really
and
truly
i
would
not
ask
you
see
doctor
i
am
working
on
a
system
goodness
how
i
am
trusting
you
and
you
can
help
oh
ever
so
much
only
tell
me
how
do
not
lose
a
chance
to
revile
me
i
was
staggered
i
beg
your
pardon
lady
helen
i
cried
ah
i
thought
you
would
understand
don't
you
see
you
are
his
only
friend
more
than
that
you
are
the
only
man
he
ever
speaks
to
he
is
a
hermit
well
then
who
else
is
there
to
reproach
me
to
his
ears
to
put
his
own
thoughts
of
me
into
words
but
what
on
earth
do
you
want
that
done
for
it
will
compel
him
to
defend
me
first
by
lip
then
by
heart
i
confess
i
whistled
i
felt
it
to
be
necessary
to
have
this
talk
with
you
went
on
lady
helen
hitherto
he
has
done
all
the
reviling
and
you
the
defending
of
me
is
it
not
so
you
little
witch
and
that
is
not
right
since
it
is
he
and
not
you
who
is
my
husband
lady
helen
you
are
surely
the
cleverest
woman
in
the
world
i
have
thought
the
matter
out
she
answered
with
a
sad
little
smile
is
it
wonderful
that
a
woman
should
wish
to
be
happy
and
that
she
should
fight
for
that
with
every
weapon
she
can
find
she

and
held
out
her
hand

make
friends

he
is
fretting
because
you
have
deserted
him
in
a
very
few
days
lady
helen

wish

could
this
moment
but
i
cannot

very
busy

i
have
a
task
to

out
it
will

finished

the
end
of
the
week
so
she
said
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
are
you
quite
engaged
could
you
not
come
to
me
to-night
your
friend
captain
weldon
comes
and
some
others
we
are
to
have
our
fortunes
told
signor
navarro
has
promised
us
a
sã©ance
miss
ottley
has
arranged
it
she
tells
me
he
is
a
truly
marvellous
clairvoyant
medium
et-cetera
have
you
a
curiosity
to
know
your
future
do
come
dixon
will
be
there
thank
you
very
much
yes
i
shall
be
glad
to
go
i
opened
the
door
for
her
and
she
blew
me
a
kiss
from
the
stairs
i
returned
to
my
work
but
it
was
very
little
i
was
able
to
do
the
rest
of
that
afternoon
what
could
have
induced
miss
ottley
to
arrange
this
sã©ance
were
her
nerves
giving
way
under
the
strain
of
dr
belleville's
threats
did
she
really
believe
this
rascal
navarro
capable
of
predicting
events
was
she
becoming
superstitious
these
reflections
profoundly
disturbed
me
chapter
xvii
the
sã©ance
navarro
evidently
belonged
to
the
highest
and
most
ingenious
order
of
charlatanry
he
had
no
assistant
no
machinery
no
accomplice
it
was
almost
impossible
to
suspect
any
of
the
audience
there
were
only
lady
helen
miss
ottley
mrs
greaves
wife
of
a
parliamentary
undersecretary
the
countess
von
oeltzen
the
austrian
ambassador's
wife
weldon
hubbard
the
count
von
oeltzen
and
myself
present
and
the
medium
scouted
the
idea
of
turning
down
the
lights
he
left
such
devices
to
impostors
he
remarked
he
was
a
tall
thin
fellow
with
big
black
eyes
and
a
thick-lipped
mouth
he
had
the
most
beautiful
hands
and
feet
his
fingers
were
covered
with
valuable
diamond
rings
he
had
a
big
bulbous
nose
and
he
wore
a
tire-boucheau
moustache
and
beard
consisting
of
about
sixteen
coarse
stiff
black
hairs
four
on
each
side
of
his
upper
lip
and
eight
on
his
chin
he
plucked
at
the
latter
continually
in
order
to
display
his
hands
and
his
rings
it
would
have
been
a
difficult
matter
to
find
his
match
in
vulgarity
in
ugliness
and
impudence
but
he
was
certainly
impressive
he
talked
of
himself
in
a
booming
baritone
like
a
barnum
praising
an
elephant
he
adored
himself
and
expected
to
be
adored
he
spoke
with
a
strong
irish-spanish
accent
probably
he
was
an
irishman
who
had
lived
in
spain
but
he
posed
as
a
full-blooded
castilian
who
had
learned
english
from
a
cork
philomath
after
he
had
exhausted
his
vocabulary
in
describing
some
of
his
clairvoyant
achievements
he
needlessly
directed
us
to
be
silent
he
had
permitted
none
of
us
a
chance
to
speak
thitherto
we
were
to
wait
he
said
till
he
began
to
breathe
in
a
peculiar
heavy
manner
and
then
who
so
wished
to
experiment
must
take
his
hands
and
hold
them
firmly
for
a
little
while
thinking
of
the
matter
next
the
experimenter's
heart
and
then
we
should
see
what
we
should
see
with
a
smile
of
lordly
self-confidence
he
reposed
his
limbs
upon
a
couch
and
sank
back
on
the
cushions
i
glanced
around
the
throng
and
saw
they
were
all
staring
at
navarro--miss
ottley
with
parted
lips
and
rapt
intentness
her
expression
irritated
me
soon
afterwards
i
met
hubbard's
eyes
he
gave
me
a
scowl
i
looked
at
weldon
he
turned
and
frowned
at
me
i
directed
my
attention
to
lady
helen
she
grew
restless
and
presently
moving
in
her
chair
glanced
rapidly
about
she
started
when
our
eyes
encountered
and
impulsively
placed
a
finger
on
her
lips
i
hadn't
thought
of
speaking
i
was
disgusted
mrs
greaves
the
countess
and
the
ambassador
all
in
turn
gave
me
scowling
glances
it
was
as
if
everybody
recognised
and
resented
my
secret
scepticism
it
appeared
i
was
the
only
sane
person
in
the
room
oh
no
there
was
navarro
he
was
sane
enough
undoubtedly
the
rogue
he
was
making
his
living
it
was
his
business
to
make
fools
of
people
i
returned
to
contemplating
him
with
a
sense
of
positive
relief
at
least
i
could
hope
to
be
amused
he
had
closed
his
eyes
and
was
therefore
uglier
than
ever
his
whole
body
was
tense
with
silent
effort
i
wondered
if
some
of
his
audience
were
unconsciously
imitating
him
they
all
were
except
myself
i
felt
inclined
to
get
up
and
shake
them
for
a
pack
of
self-delivered
dupes
lambs
self-abandoned
to
the
sacrificial
rites
of
this
high
priest
of
thomas-rot
soon
friend
navarro
began
to
breathe
stertorously
so
did
his
audience
for
a
minute
or
two
then
they
turned
and
looked
at
one
another
and
at
me
and
i
rejoice
to
say
my
calm
smile
disconcerted
them
but
i
refrained
from
glancing
at
miss
ottley
i
could
not
bear
to
see
her
look
foolish
perhaps
she
did
not
they
pointed
at
one
another
they
feared
it
seemed
to
speak
who
would
be
the
first
and
who
would
dare
the
oracle
the
count
von
oeltzen
arose
brave
noble
man
he
approached
the
couch
and
took
navarro's
hand
in
his
own
the
medium
was
now
in
a
trance
his
body
was
quite
limp
a
breathless
silence
fell
upon
the
gathering
it
lasted
about
four
minutes
then
navarro
began
to
speak
not
in
his
ordinary
booming
baritone
but
in
a
high
falsetto--his
spirit
organ
no
doubt
the
language
employed
was
german
i
see
said
he
a
short
fat
man
in
the
uniform
of
an
austrian
courier
he
is
seated
in
a
railway
train
he
is
smoking
a
cheroot
he
has
on
his
knees
a
small
flat
iron
box
it
is
a
despatch
box
it
contains
letters
and
despatches
he
is
coming
to
england----
ah
sighed
the
count
ah
ah
sighed
the
countess
he
is
on
his
way
to
you
went
on
navarro
the
despatches
are
for
you
one
of
them
is
in
a
cipher
it
relates
to
your
recall
it----
but
the
count
on
that
instant
dropped
navarro's
hands
as
if
they
had
burnt
him
and
abruptly
rose
up
the
picture
of
agitation
he
turned
and
looked
at
the
countess
she
stood
up
most
agitated
too
my
friends
he
began
but
the
countess
said
hush
he
bowed
to
her
bowed
to
lady
helen
and
offered
his
wife
a
shaking
arm
they
forthwith
left
the
room
it
was
most
dramatic
for
a
little
while
everybody
sat
under
a
sort
of
spell
i
was
glad
because
i
felt
disinclined
to
break
up
the
party
by
expressing
my
views
on
navarro's
revelation
and
if
any
one
had
said
a
word
i
should
have
been
compelled
to
speak
i
was
so
angry
that
sensible
people
could
allow
themselves
to
be
imposed
upon
so
easily
moreover
i
wished
to
learn
what
miss
ottley's
object
was
when
therefore
mrs
greaves
quietly
arose
and
moved
to
the
couch
i
said
a
little
prayer
of
thankfulness
presently
the
high
falsetto
squeaked
forth
in
irish-spanish-english
i
see--a
large
building
square
very
tall
it
is
made
of
steel
and
stone
it
is
in
america--in
new
york
it
is
a
hotel
i
see
in
it
a
room
there
are
tables
and
chairs
then
one--two--three--four--five--six
are
there
they
play
cards
the
game
is
poker
one
loses
he
is
young
he
is
english
he
has
a
little
cast
in
his
left
eye
his
name
is
julian
greaves
the
floor
is
littered
with
cards
julian
greaves
is
annoyed
because
he
loses
he----
the
voice
ceased
mrs
greaves
was
returning
to
us
she
was
smiling
she
said
to
lady
helen
in
her
calm
slow
way
i
believe
my
dear
that
my
naughty
son
is
at
present
occupied
exactly
as
you
have
heard
described
signor
navarro
has
a
great
gift
good-night
my
dear--no
i
cannot
stay--i
promised
the
bexleys
do
not
trouble----
she
had
gone
dixon
hubbard
walked
over
to
the
couch
i
glanced
at
lady
helen
she
was
biting
her
lower
lip--and
holding
her
breath
i
stole
across
the
room
on
tip-toe
and
sat
down
beside
her
i
see
said
navarro
after
the
proper
interval
a
woman
she
is
young
and
very
beautiful
oh
artful
navarro
her
mind
is
deeply
troubled
the
person
she
cares
most
for
despises
her
on
that
account
she
is
wretchedly
unhappy
although
she
permits
no
one
to
suspect
it
she
is
not
far
away
she----
but
hubbard
had
dropped
the
medium's
hand
like
hot
potatoes
it
is
your
turn
captain
weldon
he
said
with
a
poor
attempt
at
jocularity
step
forward
and
have
the
secret
of
your
life
laid
bare
he
gave
his
wife
a
scorching
glance
and
sauntered
out
of
the
room
how
much
did
you
pay
navarro
for
that
last
i
whispered
in
lady
helen's
ear
she
gave
me
a
radiant
smile
nothing
to
call
me
beautiful
she
whispered
back
weldon
had
taken
the
medium's
hands
immediately
he
did
so
navarro
heaved
a
portentous
sigh
i
watched
his
face
very
narrowly
and
somewhat
to
my
surprise
i
observed
it
to
turn
to
a
horrid
fishy
whitish-yellow
colour
presently
his
eyelids
slightly
opened
disclosing
the
whites
the
eyes
were
fixed
upwards
rigidly
he
looked
simply
monstrous
for
the
first
time
i
doubted
his
mala
fides
there
were
many
signs
of
cataleptic
trance
about
him
i
stole
over
to
the
foot
of
the
couch
and
inserted
a
pin
into
the
calf
of
his
leg
not
a
muscle
twitched
evidently
he
had
hypnotised
himself
i
tried
the
other
leg
with
an
equal
result
i
became
furious
it
seemed
just
possible
that
the
fellow
had
some
esoteric
faculty
after
all
science
of
course
scouts
the
phenomena
of
clairvoyancy
but
in
my
younger
days
i
had
witnessed
so
many
experiments
with
hypnotised
subjects
in
paris
that
i
had
ever
since
kept
an
open
mind
on
the
question
this
time
we
waited
for
quite
a
while
for
the
medium
to
begin
his
manifestations
perhaps
ten
minutes
passed
and
he
was
still
silent
but
by
that
time
i
felt
convinced
of
his
unconsciousness
ask
him
some
question
weldon
i
said
quietly
he
is
not
shamming
i
believe
in
my
opinion
he
is
in
hypnotic
sleep
and
cannot
act
as
his
own
barnum
weldon
laughed
but
before
he
could
adopt
my
hint
miss
ottley
glided
to
the
couch
and
standing
at
the
head
of
it
put
her
fingers
lightly
on
the
medium's
eyes
i
know
what
to
do
she
said
looking
at
me
i
have
seen
him
in
this
state
before
he
is
not
a
charlatan
dr
pinsent
at
least
when
he
is
like
this
presently
you
will
see
he
will
astonish
you
i
think
i
wish
you'd
ask
him
where
the
lost
key
of
my
saratoga
is
may
whispered
weldon
navarro
answered
the
question
instantly
and
in
his
natural
reverberating
baritone
it
is
lying
on
the
top
of
the
canopy
of
your
bed
in
your
bedroom
in
jermyn
street
by
gad
cried
weldon
that's
where
it
is
as
sure
as
i
stand
here
i
tossed
it
up
there
a
month
ago
and
more--and
forgot
all
about
it
hush
said
miss
ottley
think
of
dr
belleville
frankfort
please
weldon
frowned
you
might
have
chosen
a
pleasanter
topic
he
muttered
hush
said
the
girl
again
a
moment
later
she
bent
over
the
medium
speak
she
commanded
tell
us
what
you
see
navarro
sighed
i
see
a
large
room
he
began
it
is
half
library
half
laboratory
one
part
of
it
is
filled
with
racks
of
books
and
parchments
at
the
other
end
is
a
dispensary
made
up
of
shelves
containing
jars
of
different
oils
and
phials
filled
with
drugs
in
the
middle
of
the
room
is
a
table
spread
with
maps
and
papyri
the
papyri
are
inscribed
with
hieroglyphics
beside
the
table
standing
on
two
steel
trestles
is
a
large
sarcophagus
of
lead
and
iron
lined
with
silver
the
lid
is
propped
against
the
wall
near
by
it
is
ornamented
with
the
leaden
cast
of
a
man
an
inscription
states
that
this
man
is
ptahmes
a
high
priest
of
amen-ra
his
body
was
once
enclosed
within
the
sarcophagus
it
is
now
however
reclining
on
a
couch
at
a
little
distance
from
the
table----
describe
it
said
miss
ottley
it
is
apparently
the
body
of
a
man
of
latter
middle
age
it
is
of
great
proportions
it
is
almost
seven
feet
in
length
but
the
body
is
very
lank
and
shrunken
and
ill
nourished
the
head
is
of
extraordinary
shape
and
dimensions
it
is
very
large
and
long
and
broad
it
is
surmounted
by
a
crown
of
jet-black
hair
that
has
recently
been
cut
it
tapers
like
a
cone
above
the
temples
and
again
like
an
inverted
cone
from
the
cheek
bones
to
the
chin
the
nose
is
long
and
hooked
like
the
beak
of
an
eagle
the
eyes
are
closed
i
cannot
see
them
but
they
are
almond
shaped
and
set
far
apart
in
the
skull
the
mouth
is
shrivelled
and
almost
shapeless
the
chin
is
long
and
pointed
the
skin
is
dark
brown
almost
black
it
looks
unhealthy
the
body
is
clothed
in
ordinary
european
garments
one
arm
is
fastened
in
a
sling
the
chest
is
underneath
the
clothes
swathed
in
bandages
on
the
feet
are
fastened
rubber
shoes
on
the
soles
of
which
are
particles
of
fresh-dried
mud
that
is
all
proceed
said
miss
ottley
there
are
living
people
in
the
room
are
there
not
two
replied
the
medium
after
a
short
pause
one
is
seated
before
the
table
poring
over
a
torn
piece
of
papyrus
beside
him
on
the
table
is
a
dictionary
of
hieroglyphics
to
which
he
constantly
refers
he
is
a
big
thick-set
man
with
black
eyes
strongly
marked
features
and
a
black
bushy
beard
in
his
hand
is
a
pen
he
writes
with
this
pen
upon
the
paper
before
him
he
is
engaged
in
translating
the
papyrus
ha
he
stops
he
is
looking
up
at
his
companion
he
is
speaking
what
does
he
say
he
says
'i
cannot
altogether
reconcile
our
subject's
statements
with
the
records
ottley
either
in
his
long
sleep
his
memory
has
somewhat
failed
him
or
in
his
sleep
he
has
learnt
more
than
he
knew
before
it
is
most
annoying
we
shall
have
to
question
him
again'
the
other--a
little
old
man
with
white
hair
and
very
bright
small
grey
eyes--replies
'you
are
too
damned
pernicketty
doctor
haven't
we
the
formula
and
hasn't
it
nobly
stood
the
test
of
practical
experience
what
more
do
you
want
your
infernal
curiosity
would
ruin
everything
if
i
let
you
have
your
way
once
for
all
i
tell
you
that
ptahmes
belongs
to
me
not
to
you
damn
your
science
you've
had
enough
out
of
him
i'll
not
allow
him
to
be
used
again
except
for
my
purposes
he
has
disappointed
me
with
the
elixir
well
he'll
have
to
atone
by
making
me
the
richest
man
in
the
universe
i'll
not
be
satisfied
till
every
shilling
in
the
world
belongs
to
me--every
shilling--every
shilling'
the
little
man
is
now
laughing
like
a
lunatic
the
big
man
watches
him
with
a
frown
bending
his
big
black
brows
together
'but
you
fool'
he
says
very
angrily
'do
you
forget
that
these
things
here--'
he
points
to
the
body
of
ptahmes--'will
soon
wear
out
every
time
that
you
drive
it
to
work
the
friction
sheds
into
dust
a
portion
of
its
matter
is
it
not
better
to
use
its
brain
than
its
body
remember
that
we
cannot
repair
his
tissues
unless
we
make
absolutely
certain
of
the
composition
of
the
invisible
oil
while
we
have
the
chance
we
may
be
left
stranded
in
the
end
his
body
is
of
secondary
importance
after
all
it
serves
you
now
but
you
can
just
as
well
serve
yourself
by
using
the
oil
and
doing
your
own
dirty
business
but
the
thing
is
to
make
sure
of
learning
how
to
replenish
the
oil
when
our
stock
gives
out
that
is
the
all-important
matter
and
that
is
why
his
brain
is
of
paramount
interest
to
me
and
should
be
to
you'
the
little
man
says--'i
won't
have
it
i
tell
you
we
know
enough'
the
big
man
replies--'be
sensible
ottley
remember
he
lost
five
pounds
in
weight
yesterday
he
is
melting
away
before
our
eyes
come
i'll
make
you
a
proposal
let
me
do
what
i
like
with
ptahmes
and
i'll
take
his
place
for
your
money-making
purposes
i'll
be
the
ghost
of
the
stock
exchange
and
find
out
all
you
want
to
know
now
what
can
be
fairer
than
that'
the
little
man
is
biting
his
lip
he
seems
to
be
thinking
there
was
a
pause
in
the
narration
presently
navarro
went
on
the
little
man
speaks
again
he
says--'that
is
all
very
well
doctor
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do--that
you
intend
to
use
ptahmes
to
destroy
your
rival
you
haven't
the
courage
to
do
it
yourself'
the
big
man
answers
very
quickly
'and
are
you
brave
enough
to
tackle
pinsent
yet
his
existence
threatens
all
our
plans
i
firmly
believe
he
has
a
notion
of
our
ideas
already
he
is
no
fool
and
an
adept
at
putting
two
and
two
together
do
you
suppose
he
hasn't
guessed
at
the
reason
of
the
success
of
your
enormous
transactions
on
'change'
the
little
man
grinds
his
teeth
'curse
him'
he
shouts
'curse
him
to
hell'
the
big
man
smiles
'with
all
my
heart'
he
says
'may
he
rot
there
for
ever
and
ever
but
all
this
proves
to
us
how
careful
we
should
be
of
the
waning
strength
of
our
magician
remember
the
last
time
he
tried
odds
with
pinsent
on
the
nile
he
got
all
the
worst
of
the
encounter
three
broken
ribs
it's
true
we
are
more
advanced
in
knowledge
since
then
and
now
we
can
make
him
quite
invisible
but
all
the
same
we
cannot
afford
to
trifle
with
the
strength
of
our
subject
considering
the
two
great
tasks
before
him'--ah----
the
last
expression
was
a
groan
the
medium
moved
restlessly
then
groaned
again
proceed
i
command
you
said
miss
ottley
in
a
trembling
voice
but
navarro
for
a
third
time
groaned
and
he
began
to
struggle
on
the
couch
oh
god
he
is
waking
up
cried
the
girl
hold
his
hands
tightly
frankfort
he
must
tell
us
more
he
must
he
must
but
navarro
with
a
sudden
spasmodic
writhe
and
twist
broke
away
and
sat
erect
he
was
shaking
like
a
man
in
an
ague
and
he
began
to
pant
and
groan
like
a
wounded
animal
miss
ottley
gasped
too
late
and
wrung
her
hands
i
handed
the
medium
a
glass
of
water
but
he
was
trembling
too
violently
to
take
it
of
himself
he
spilt
half
the
contents
on
his
knee
i
forced
the
rest
into
his
mouth
it
revived
him
a
little
later
he
stood
up
he
was
bathed
in
perspiration
and
looked
sick
but
he
rejected
all
offers
of
assistance
he
seemed
to
be
very
angry
he
declared
that
we
had
treated
him
most
cruelly
and
that
we
might
have
killed
him
he
would
not
be
appeased
and
he
went
off
in
the
care
of
a
footman
filled
with
petulant
resentment
and
mouthing
stupid
threats
it
may
have
been
a
pose
part
of
his
business
intended
for
effect
to
impress
his
clients--probably
it
was
but
i
am
not
sure
he
certainly
seemed
to
be
in
a
highly
over-wrought
nervous
condition
he
could
not
easily
have
affected
that
after
he
had
gone
we
all
sat
back
in
our
chairs
and
stared
at
one
another
nobody
was
in
the
least
haste
to
speak
we
had
so
much
to
think
about
and
it
was
plain
that
fancy--well
i
never
and
ejaculations
of
that
ilk
did
not
even
begin
to
meet
the
conversational
demands
of
the
occasion
lady
helen
was
the
first
to
speak
she
said
well
i
am
trying
hard
to
be
an
ideal
hostess
and
not
ask
any
questions
that
might
seem
impertinent
but
will
someone
tell
me
is
it
sir
robert
ottley
and
dr
belleville
who
are
making
preparations
for
dr
pinsent's
funeral
i
wish
to
know
real
badly
because
i
want
him
to
do
quite
a
lot
of
things
for
me
before
he
crosses
over
the
divide
and
if
necessary
i
shall
go
to
sir
robert
and
ask
him
for
my
sake
to
give
dr
pinsent
a
little
time
to
say
his
prayers
it
was
just
the
flippant
tone
needed
to
bring
us
back
to
earth
again
everybody
laughed
everybody
was
so
relieved
that
the
laugh
was
unconventionally
loud
and
it
had
a
tendency
to
overdo
itself
then
we
trotted
out
the
well-i-nevers
did
you
ever
hear
such
a
lot
of
rubbish
talk
demanded
lady
helen
it
quite
took
my
breath
away
said
miss
ottley
with
a
gallant
effort
to
attain
the
correct
approved
sociably
foolish
affectation
of
brainlessness
the
fellow
deserves
three
months
without
the
option
for
his
villainous
slanders
said
the
captain
heartily
he
was
honest
anyhow
lord
knows
i
can't
stand
belleville
at
any
price
he
continued
but
navarro
went
a
bit
too
far
by
gad
i
never
heard
anything
more
malicious
in
my
life
than
his
vile
insinuations
a
discharged
servant
i
observed
malice
was
to
be
expected
from
one
of
navarro's
type
and
a
foreigner
to
boot
said
the
captain
in
the
manner
of
one
absolutely
clinching
an
argument
ah
well
he
suppressed
a
yawn
he
entertained
us--and
that's
something
seen
the
'japanese
marriage'
yet
lady
helen
miss
ottley
and
i
did
an
act
or
two
last
night
it's
ripping
so--ah
so
jolly
unusual
don't
you
know
you
get
left
every
time
you
think
something
is
going
to
happen
and
when
you
least
expect
it
one
of
the
funny
little
beggars
ups
and
wants
to
make
his
friend
a
present
of
his
liver
on
a
plate
or
cut
off
his
rival's
head
or
something
miss
ottley's
carriage
announced
a
footman
i
asked
for
it
said
the
girl
to
lady
helen
my
father
has
been
very
poorly
all
day
weldon
went
away
with
her
she
did
not
even
spare
me
a
glance
lady
helen
consoled
me
with
the
best
cigar
i
have
ever
received
at
the
hands
of
a
woman
she
lit
a
cigarette
for
herself
and
curled
up
on
a
pile
of
cushions
that
man
navarro
is
a
rapacious
rascal
she
observed
presently
he
wouldn't
take
a
penny
less
than
a
hundred
to
say
what
he
did
say
to
dixon
but
i
did
not
tell
him
to
call
me
beautiful
she
added
i
am
glad
to
be
certain
that
the
fellow
is
a
rascal
i
muttered
half
underbreath
but
she
heard
me
surely
you
knew
his
ravings
did
not
take
you
in
she
cried
scornfully
everyone
knows
he
simply
loathes
sir
robert
ottley
he
used
to
be
the
little
old
millionaire's
tin
god
sir
robert
hardly
dared
to
breathe
without
consulting
his
oracle
and
they
say
the
man
bled
him
of
thousands
no
wonder
he
went
mad
to
find
that
sir
robert
had
escaped
his
influence
ever
since
then
he
has
been
saying
the
most
awful
things
lots
of
people
believe
them
i
know
but
i
never
thought
you
would
i
don't
i
smiled
i
could
smile
now
for
i
felt
wonderfully
relieved
but
tell
me
lady
helen
just
why
you
employed
him
to
say
that
to
your
husband
she
puffed
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
dixon
is
superstitious
at
heart
she
replied
he
will
not
want
to
but
he
will
end
by
believing
what
navarro
told
him
what
that
you
care
for
him
despising
you
silly
she
cried
no--not
that
i
care
for
him--but
for
another
man
despising
me--the
man
for
whom
i
care
have
you
forgotten
navarro's
words
but
why
on
earth
deceive
your
husband
to
make
him
jealous
of
a
chimera
no
my
friend
said
lady
helen
smiling
very
strangely
of
you
remember
you
have
promised
to
revile
me
to
him
that
alone
would
fix
a
suspicious
mind
like
his
on
you
but
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
i
told
him
this
afternoon
that
it
hurt
me
very
much
to
find
that
he
had
given
you
a
poor
opinion
of
me
i
sprang
to
my
feet
aghast
but
look
here--my
girl
i
cried
this
is
a
dangerous
game
you
are
playing
are
you
afraid--are
you
then
a
coward
she
flashed
hubbard
is
my
oldest
friend
you
will
make
him
hate
me
i
protested
and
you
will
refuse
to
risk
that
for
his
happiness
and
mine
she
asked
remember
he
is
my
husband
and
soured
twisted
creature
that
he
is
i
love
him
ah
said
i
i
could
have
made
you
serve
me
in
ignorance
she
cried
but
i
am
incapable
of
playing
you
or
any
other--save
him--a
trick
like
that
however
say
the
word
and
the
play
ends--this
instant
i
have
no
claim
upon
you
i'll
save
you
the
trouble
of
telling
me
that
i
am
only
a
woman
fellow-creature
and
knight-errants
are
out
of
fashion
now-a-days
well--what
is
it
to
be
her
words
stung
like
nettles
such
a
little
spitfire
i
had
never
seen
before
but
that
was
the
proper
way
to
treat
me
and
i
believe
she
knew
it
she
was
as
sharp
as
any
needle
that
young
woman
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
breaking
my
word
once
given
i
growled
out
good-night
then
i
stalked
off
most
indignant
but
she
caught
me
at
the
door
flung
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
kissed
me
on
both
cheeks
you
are
a
darling
she
whispered
and--well--dixon
will
have
to
hurry
and
reform--or
else--but
there--go
that
is
the
way
clever
women
bind
foolish
men
to
the
furtherance
of
their
caprices
a
cuff
a
kiss
a
piece
of
subtle
thrilling
flattery
and
the
trick
is
done
i
was
heart
and
soul
in
love
with
another
woman
and
yet
from
that
moment
lady
helen
hubbard
possessed
the
right
to
walk
over
me
if
she
wished
to
do
it
and
mind
you
i
am
not
an
out-of-the-way
brand
of
idiot
as
fools
go
it's
just
a
matter
of
armour
and
the
weak
spot
no
suit
of
armour
ever
existed
that
hadn't
one
some
women
are
born
with
the
faculty
of
being
able
to
put
their
soft
little
fingers
on
those
places
right
away
chapter
xviii
the
unseen
for
my
sake
watch
it
is
but
for
two
days
longer--the
fatal
week
will
then
be
over
oh
i
implore
you
not
to
let
your
scepticism
make
you
careless
i
trust
you
and
depend
upon
you
weldon
gave
me
the
note
himself
it
was
not
signed
he
watched
me
curiously
as
i
read
it
i
tore
it
up
and
threw
the
pieces
in
the
grate
miss
ottley
is
afraid
that
your
friend
belleville
meditates
doing
you
an
injury
i
said
carelessly
and
knowing
that
i
am
your
guest
she
has
appointed
me
your
guardian
angel
evidently
she
imagines
that
you
are
a
more
sensible
person
than
i
am
she
said
nothing
about
it
to
you
no
replied
the
captain
but
she
made
me
promise
not
to
leave
your
side
for
the
next
two
days
he
gave
a
sheepish
laugh
i'm
afraid
she
has
let
you
in
for
a
lot
of
boredom
old
man
but
don't
you
bother
to
be
polite
if
you
feel
like
kicking
me
at
any
time
to
relieve
your
feelings
i'll
take
it
lying
down
you
see
i
couldn't
help
myself
she
has
such
a
way
with
her--and
although
i
argued
and
protested
and
begged
her
to
consider
you--it
was
no
use
i
had
to
give
in
you
needn't
apologise
weldon
i
believe
i
am
strong
enough
to
survive
the
infliction
and
i
promise
not
to
kick
you
how
is
miss
ottley
she
is
well
although
she
seems
nervous
and
depressed
that
is
probably
because
her
father
is
ill
and
she
has
been
nursing
him
you
have
heard
i
suppose
of
his
latest
doings
no
as
you
are
aware
i
have
not
been
out
of
doors
for
two
days
and
i
have
carefully
refrained
from
newspapers
he
has
cornered
the
copper
market
they
say
his
fortune
is
increasing
at
the
rate
of
half
a
million
a
day
but
he
is
not
strong
enough
to
bear
the
excitement
in
my
opinion
it
is
killing
him
i
saw
him
this
afternoon
he
looks
ghastly
he
was
a
little
delirious
i
fancy
they
left
me
alone
with
him
for
a
moment
or
two
and
he
took
the
opportunity
to
warn
me
not
to
sleep
to-night
if
i
valued
my
life
he
said
a
terrible
danger
is
hanging
over
my
head
but
dr
belleville
came
in
just
then
and
it
was
surprising
how
sensible
he
got
again
immediately
naturally
i
said
nothing
of
this
to
may
it
would
only
have
made
her
miserable
it
is
wonderful
how
she
dotes
on
the
poor
old
fellow
i
don't
know
what
she
would
do
if
he
were
to
die
how
did
belleville
treat
you
for
a
wonder
with
the
greatest
courtesy
he
took
me
aside
and
begged
me
to
forget
any
occasion
of
offence
he
appealed
to
me
as
the
successful
one--and
he
gave
me
his
word
unasked
that
he
would
never
again
do
anything
to
hurt
may's
feelings
or
mine
after
all
he's
not
such
a
bad
fellow
pinsent
one
must
make
allowances
it's
not
his
fault
that
he
is
in
love
with
may
he
can't
help
that
my
wonder
is
that
every
man
who
knows
her
is
not
i
suppose
you
forgave
him
we
shook
hands
certainly
you
wouldn't
have
me
bear
malice
would
you
remember
i'm
in
a
position
to
be
generous--and
he
made
the
advance
my
dear
lad
i
answered
slowly
i
wouldn't
have
an
atom
of
you
changed
for
worlds
you
are
an
absolute
ass
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
somehow
or
other
you
make
me
want
to
be
the
same
sort
of
idiot
and
i
feel
positively
ashamed
at
times
that
i
cannot
you
should
have
seen
his
face
flush
and
the
hangdog
way
he
tried
to
pass
over
the
compliment
by
cursing
an
untied
shoestring
and
me
at
the
same
time
for
trying
to
pull
a
fellow's
leg
we
went
for
a
ride
in
the
park
that
afternoon
and
just
to
be
pleasant
the
captain
forced
on
me
the
gift
of
his
finest
arab
and
a
permanent
stall
in
his
stable
in
which
to
keep
the
animal
he
knew
the
dear
fool
that
i
could
not
afford
to
keep
it
myself
i
believe
he
would
have
suffered
tortures
had
i
refused
him
but
indeed
i
had
no
thought
the
gift
completely
captivated
me
i
felt
like
a
child
with
a
new
toy
and
as
proud
as
any
peacock
the
horse
was
a
noble
creature
i
named
him
forthwith
abd-el-kadir
and
the
pair
of
us
spent
the
evening
petting
him
until
it
was
time
to
dine
we
had
the
gayest
possible
meal
and
afterwards
went
to
the
empire
reaching
home
a
little
before
midnight
like
reputable
bachelors
the
captain
as
usual
with
him
fell
asleep
almost
as
soon
as
his
head
touched
the
pillow
but
i
had
a
trust
to
fulfil
and
ridiculous
as
it
may
seem
as
soon
as
i
heard
young
weldon's
quiet
breathing
it
began
to
weigh
upon
me
all
sorts
of
mad
questions
began
to
ask
themselves
over
in
my
mind
what
if
sir
robert
ottley
and
dr
belleville
had
really
discovered
some
wonderful
secret
of
nature
what
if
belleville
had
really
determined
to
assassinate
his
rival
what
if--in
that
act--he
purposed
to
make
me
appear
to
be
the
criminal
what
if--as
the
medium
had
hinted--they
had
found
a
way
to
make
themselves
invisible
it
was
no
use
calling
myself
names
and
saying
mentally
pinsent
for
heaven's
sake
be
reasonable
something
had
come
over
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
nervous
mysterious
fears
obsessed
me
for
an
hour
i
lay
on
my
side
and
watched
the
captain
then
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
i
got
up
and
stole
over
to
the
door
it
was
locked
securely
i
looked
under
both
beds
and
peered
into
wardrobes
and
cupboards
when
i
had
perfectly
convinced
myself
that
weldon
and
i
were
the
only
occupants
of
the
room
i
felt
a
little
better
but
only
a
very
little
i
resolved
to
spend
the
night
watching
i
lighted
a
cigar
and
then
threw
myself
into
an
armchair
fixing
my
eyes
on
the
captain
he
slept
like
a
babe
i
do
not
know
when
it
was
exactly
that
i
became
actually
aware
of
a
third
presence
in
the
room
probably
the
idea
had
been
gradually
growing
upon
me
for
i
experienced
no
sudden
shock
of
surprise
when
conviction
displaced
doubt
i
said
to
myself
this
person
whoever
he
may
be
has
come
here
intending
to
strangle
or
smother
weldon
in
his
sleep
but
my
watchfulness
has
baffled
him
what
will
he
do
i
was
soon
to
be
informed
a
slight
a
very
slight
noise
drew
my
attention
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
over
a
little
cupboard
hung
the
captain's
sword
in
his
scabbard
the
sword
but
not
the
scabbard
was
moving
the
blade
was
gradually
appearing
and
my
flesh
crept
to
see
that
it
was
apparently
of
its
own
volition
moving
not
downwards
but
upwards
along
the
wall
i
distinctly
saw
its
shadow
appear
and
lengthen
on
the
wall
but
no
other
shadow
was
cast
to
explain
the
cause
for
a
moment
i
was
petrified--paralysed
by
an
abhorrence
of
the
supernatural
then
the
sword
entirely
left
the
scabbard
it
advanced
slowly
point
downwards
borne
on
air
into
the
room
as
it
moved
it
swished
slightly
to
and
fro
the
invisible
hand
that
held
it
must
have
been
trembling
the
thought
recovered
me
i
stood
up
the
sword
stopped
i
flashed
a
glance
around
the
room
the
poker
in
the
fireplace
attracted
my
attention
i
gave
a
sudden
bound
and
reached
it
the
sword
flashed
across
the
room
towards
captain
weldon's
bed
god
knows
how
i
got
there
in
time
to
save
him
but
i
did
the
point
was
quivering
at
his
throat
when
i
dashed
it
aside
and
with
the
return
blow
crashed
the
poker
upon
a
hard
thickness
of
transparent
matter
the
clang
of
steel
awoke
weldon
but
i
had
no
time
for
him
the
sword
was
in
retreat
i
followed
it
it
was
making
for
the
door
i
raised
the
poker
for
another
blow
but
on
the
instant
the
blade
fell
crashing
to
the
boards
and
i
heard
the
key
turning
in
the
lock
i
hurled
myself
against
the
panels
and
was
brought
up
against
a
body
thank
god
though
i
could
not
see
it
i
could
feel
it
it
was
a
man
weldon
i
shouted
and
was
locked
in
a
deadly
struggle
over
and
over
we
rolled
the
invisible
man
and
i
weldon
stood
over
us
looking
on
like
one
in
a
dream
he
could
only
see
me
and
he
thought
i
had
gone
mad
and
was
behaving
as
maniacs
sometimes
do
the
invisible
man
was
strong--strong
he
twined
his
hands
around
my
throat
and
i
could
not
prevent
him
but
slowly
steadily
surely
i
forced
his
chin
back
i
wished
to
break
his
neck
i
have
an
impression
he
was
nude
but
cannot
be
sure
i
twined
my
right
hand
in
his
hair
with
my
left
around
his
neck
i
drew
him
to
me
i
was
undermost
to
save
himself
he
began
to
beat
my
skull
against
the
boards
it
was
then
that
weldon
intervened
he
seized
my
wrists
and
tried
to
lift
me
up
to
save
me
as
he
thought
from
doing
myself
an
injury
but
all
he
did
was
to
save
the
life
of
the
invisible
man
weldon's
grasp
on
my
wrists
forced
mine
in
some
measure
to
relax
i
put
forth
all
my
strength
but
in
vain
the
invisible
man
used
his
chance
and
writhed
away
from
me
i
struggled
afoot
casting
weldon
off
but
too
late
the
door
opened
before
our
eyes
and
our
enemy
unseen
fled
banging
the
door
behind
him
i
heard
the
patter
of
feet
as
he
departed
the
captain
uttered
an
oath
oh
you
fool
you
fool
i
cried
at
him
by
george
gasped
weldon
did
you
see
that
door
he
rushed
forward
and
opened
it
again
peering
out
into
the
passage
i
fell
into
a
chair
spent
and
panting
presently
weldon
came
back
he
picked
up
his
sword
and
examined
it
there
was
a
great
gap
in
the
edge
near
the
point
where
i
had
struck
it
with
the
poker
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
he
cried
i
told
him
as
soon
as
i
was
able
but
from
the
first
he
did
not
believe
me
and
he
was
honest
enough
to
say
so
how
could
i
blame
him
the
story
sounded
incredible
even
to
me
while
i
was
telling
it
weldon
adopted
the
most
charitable
possible
view
i
had
dreamed
everything
and
acted
the
somnambulist
he
admitted
that
it
was
a
queer
circumstance
the
door
opening
and
shutting
so
unexpectedly
but
no
doubt
one
of
the
other
lodgers
in
the
house
had
tried
it
in
passing--some
late
bird
a
bit
under
the
weather
weldon
thought--and
finding
it
yield
had
banged
it
shut
again
it
was
no
use
retorting
that
the
door
had
been
locked--weldon
merely
laughed
and
asked
what
more
likely
than
that
i
had
turned
the
latch
before
smashing
his
best
blade
he
was
quite
upset
about
his
sword
it
had
been
carried
by
his
grandfather
at
waterloo
he
plainly
considered
the
damage
i
had
done
to
it
was
the
only
serious
occurrence
of
the
night
but
he
strove
like
a
hero
to
keep
me
from
realising
just
how
bad
he
did
feel
about
it
i
ceased
protesting
at
last
and
abandoned
the
vain
task
of
trying
to
convince
him
of
the
deadly
peril
that
had
menaced
him
he
returned
the
sword
to
its
scabbard
and
with
a
subdued
sigh
got
back
into
bed
again
within
ten
minutes
he
was
fast
asleep
as
for
me
i
paced
the
floor
till
morning
thinking
thinking
thinking
i
have
no
shame
in
confessing
that
i
was
horribly
afraid
not
of
the
immediate
present
but
the
future
i
did
not
expect
our
mysterious
assailant
to
return
that
night
but
what
of
the
morrow
i
am
not
a
believer
in
the
supernatural
or
i
must
have
set
down
the
unseen
marauder
as
a
spirit
but
i
had
felt
and
wrestled
with
the
thing
and
knew
it
for
a
man
i
had
heard
the
patter
of
its
feet
moreover
the
memory
of
the
sã©ance
and
navarro's
dramatic
recitation
supplied
me
with
a
sort
of
clue
what
if
navarro
had
not
been
acting
but
had
really
been
clairvoyant
who
shall
dare
to
define
the
limits
of
the
possible
was
it
more
marvellous
that
he
should
have
heard
and
seen
things
really
happening
in
a
trance
than
that
i--in
full
possession
of
all
my
faculties--had
wrestled
with
a
man
invisible
in
the
bright
glare
of
an
incandescent
lamp
i
said
to
myself
it
is
necessary
to
assume
that
navarro
is
a
true
medium
if
only
for
the
sake
of
argument
well
in
that
case
it
is
clear
that
dr
belleville
and
sir
robert
ottley
had
found
in
the
tomb
of
ptahmes
a
papyrus
containing
a
tremendous
scientific
secret
this
secret
is
one
which
teaches
its
possessors
how
to
control
forces
of
nature
in
a
manner
which
my
imagination
can
only
guess
at
for
the
production
of
a
physical
result
which
i
have
actually
experienced
they
have
learned
how
to
override
the
laws
of
light
they
have
discovered
a
means
of
not
only
rendering
opaque
objects
transparent
but
positively
invisible
and
they
are
using
their
secret
knowledge
to
further
their
nefarious
designs
sir
robert
ottley
is
using
it
to
increase
his
fortune
by
spying
out
the
financial
secrets
of
his
business
rivals
dr
belleville
is
using
it
to
accomplish
the
destruction
of
captain
weldon
his
rival
in
love
and
in
all
probability
they
both
intend
it
to
remove
me
from
their
path
because
they
fear
that
i
suspect
them
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
i
adopted
these
conclusions
with
any
sort
of
confidence
they
entered
my
mind
and
remained
there
but
i
received
them
churlishly
and
treated
them
as
unwelcome
guests
and
the
only
reason
that
i
did
not
expel
them
was
because
i
could
not
discover
try
as
i
would
any
more
substantial
or
sensible
explanation
of
an
event
which
they
pretended
to
explain
when
the
dawn
broke
and
the
light
of
day
began
to
steal
into
the
room
between
the
shutters
i
looked
around
and
shook
my
head
after
all
had
i
fallen
asleep
against
my
will
and
dreamed
the
whole
thing
as
weldon
believed
it
might
be
so
the
intellect
is
a
strange
elusive
shadowy
affair
it
slips
from
one's
control
at
times
the
memory
easily
clogs
the
imagination
is
easily
overheated
and
one
is
not
the
best
judge
of
one's
own
experiences
science
had
taught
me
so
much
at
least
that
one
cannot
always
accept
the
evidence
of
sense
i
began
to
doubt
to
cast
about
me
and
to
vote
myself
absurd
with
the
rising
of
the
sun
i
flung
back
the
shutters
and
looked
forth
on
a
vista
of
chimneys
and
leaded
roofs
they
were
so
manifestly
real
and
solid
and
prosaic
that
all
my
brain
expanded
to
a
sense
of
ridicule
except
one
small
part
which
began
to
shrivel
up
under
the
douche
i
poured
upon
it
of
what
i
called
cold
common-sense
but
it
did
not
entirely
shrivel
up
it
insisted
on
certain
reservations
it
said
to
me
pinsent
my
man
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
are
dreamt
of
in
your
philosophy
you
have
no
right
to
ill-treat
a
part
of
your
intelligence
which--even
though
it
may
have
erred--served
you
to
the
best
of
its
ability
and
can
you
be
sure
it
erred
if
it
hap
that
it
did
not
you
would
never
forgive
yourself
for
flouting
it
be
wise
in
time
don't
prejudge
the
case
wait
and
watch
take
precautions
guard
yourself--and
above
all
guard
your
charge
i
determined
to
suspend
judgment
above
all
i
determined
to
guard
my
charge
but
i
confess
it
was
with
a
curling
lip
i
made
the
resolution
there
is
something
in
sunlight
some
all-subduing
power
which
irresistibly
dries
up
the
fountain
springs
of
the
imagination
i
cannot
conceive
a
novelist
writing
a
fanciful
story
in
the
sunlight
can
you
and
the
sunlight
was
pouring
into
the
room
when
i
came
to
my
resolve
chapter
xix
the
first
victim
when
weldon
woke
he
did
one
of
the
three
things
of
which
only
gentlemen
of
the
finest
sensitiveness
are
capable
he
gave
me
one
quick
laughing
glance
but
perceiving
in
my
solemn
visage
a
predisposition
to
resent
badinage
he
immediately
said
good-morning
old
chap
hope
you
rested
well
as
usual
i
slept
like
a
log--all
night
now
who
could
help
liking
a
man
of
that
stamp
not
i
most
certainly
and
not
satisfied
with
pretending
to
have
forgotten
everything
he
resolutely
refrained
from
so
much
as
glancing
at
his
treasured
sword
which
i
had
broken
my
heart
went
out
to
him
in
such
a
flood
of
feeling
that
in
order
to
conceal
how
fond
of
him
i
was
and
how
grateful
i
simply
had
to
be
insulting
you
needn't
tell
me
you
slept
i
growled
you
snored
like
a
whole
sty-full
of
hogs
which
was
a
lie
it's
a
wonder
to
me
you
did
not
wake
yourself
why
didn't
you
shy
a
boot
at
my
head
he
asked
i'm
awfully
sorry
pinsent
i
can
see
i
kept
you
awake
you
look
quite
washed
out
oh
i'm
alright
or
will
be
after
a
hot
bath
i
replied
ungraciously
and
left
the
room
when
i
returned
he
had
a
bottle
of
champagne
ready
for
me
as
a
pick-me-up
and
he
was
hard
at
work
polishing
my
boots--all
this
by
way
of
apology
i
swallowed
some
wine
and
allowed
myself
to
unbend
i
suggested
a
ride
to
work
up
an
appetite
for
breakfast
he
joyously
agreed
so
we
dressed
and
went
out
a
gallop
in
the
park
made
us
as
jolly
as
a
pair
of
sand
boys
we
had
dã©jeuner
at
verrey's
and
then
went
to
call
on
miss
ottley
she
was
out
however
so
i
dragged
my
charge
to
an
eye
specialist
in
harley
street
i
pretended
an
eyeache
and
had
my
eyes
thoroughly
examined
the
specialist
could
find
nothing
wrong
with
them
on
the
contrary
he
congratulated
me
on
a
singularly
perfect
vision
after
that
we
went
to
weldon's
club
dawdled
there
for
a
hour
and
then
on
the
suggestion
of
lord
william
hurlingham
commonly
known
as
bill
we
ran
down
to
maidenhead
for
a
row
on
the
river
it
was
a
perfect
day
and
we
enjoyed
ourselves
amazingly
so
much
so
that
we
lost
count
of
time
and
were
obliged
to
dine
at
a
maidenhead
hotel
it
thus
came
about
that
it
was
after
nine
when
we
strolled
to
the
station
to
return
to
town
there
was
a
considerable
crowd
of
holiday-makers
on
the
platform
and
one
party
gave
us
much
amusement
these
details
are
important
to
explain
what
followed
the
party
consisted
of
half
a
dozen
jews
and
as
many
jewesses
they
were
all
as
gorgeously
attired
as
if
they
had
been
attending
a
regal
audience
but
their
conversation
conducted
in
tones
loud
enough
to
provoke
general
attention
informed
us
that
they
had
been
spending
the
day
on
the
houseboat
of
a
certain
well-known
nobleman
of
notorious
impecuniousness
lord
bill
a
bit
of
a
wag
made
a
remark
that
i
did
not
catch
about
the
jews
and
their
nobleman
which
sent
weldon
into
a
convulsion
of
laughter
he
then
turned
to
me
and
began
to
repeat
it
for
my
benefit
just
at
that
moment
the
train
came
rushing
into
the
station
weldon
stood
near
the
edge
of
the
platform
with
his
back
to
the
line
glancing
sideways
at
the
jews
and
trying
to
restrain
his
mirth
i
had
bent
my
head
the
better
to
hear
lord
bill
who
was
a
short
man
but
my
eyes
were
on
weldon
conceive
my
surprise
to
observe
him
stagger
backwards
of
a
sudden
as
though
he
had
been
struck
on
the
forehead
he
uttered
a
startled
cry
and
clawed
the
air
with
both
hands
for
a
brief
second
he
tottered
at
an
angle
as
though
he
held
on
to
something
which
supported
him
but
next
instant
as
if
carried
off
his
feet
by
a
great
rush
of
wind
he
went
back
back--over
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
before
i
could
move
a
muscle
or
utter
a
word
he
had
fallen
and
was
lying
on
the
rails
under
the
very
wheels
of
the
onrushing
engine
men
shouted
women
shrieked
i
sprang
forward
and
hardly
aware
of
the
peril
would
have
leaped
upon
the
line
but
that
a
dozen
hands
restrained
me
it
would
have
meant
infallibly
my
death
as
well
as
weldon's
for
the
train
was
not
more
than
a
dozen
feet
off
but
i
was
incapable
of
reasoning
at
the
moment
i
struggled
like
a
madman
with
my
captors
and
broke
away
from
them
at
last--to
stand
dazedly
staring
at
the
engine
for
some
horrid
seconds
it
had
stopped
but
had
it----
with
a
great
effort
i
dragged
myself
forward
the
edge
of
the
platform
was
lined
with
a
crowd
of
white-faced
silent
people
they
made
room
for
me
several
railway
officials
were
stooping
over
a
frightful
object
lying
between
the
pavement
and
the
nearest
iron
rail
one
of
them
shouted
for
a
doctor
and
there
was
an
immediate
movement
in
the
crowd
two
or
three
men
set
off
through
the
station
at
a
run
i
closed
my
eyes
i
had
never
been
so
shaken
in
my
life
i
had
never
lost
my
self-control
so
utterly
the
wheels
of
the
engine
had
completely
amputated
both
poor
weldon's
legs
midway
between
the
knee
and
trunk
there
followed
a
hiatus
in
my
reckoning
when
i
came
properly
to
my
senses
i
was
hard
at
work
tying
up
the
arteries
assisted
by
a
medical
student
who
had
been
a
passenger
in
the
fatal
train
and
a
nurse
who
had
apparently
been
holiday-making
on
the
river
i
remember
how
anxious
she
was
to
save
her
pretty
muslin
gown
from
the
spouting
blood
presently
a
surgeon
who
had
been
called
appeared
armed
with
proper
instruments
with
his
aid
i
hastily
replaced
the
imperfect
tourniquets
i
had
improvised
out
of
kerchiefs
and
neckcloths
with
gutta
percha
bandages
and
we
removed
poor
weldon
from
the
station
to
the
villa
of
a
gentleman
who
had
charitably
placed
his
house
at
our
disposal
from
the
very
first
i
felt
that
there
was
no
hope
not
only
had
my
luckless
friend
lost
his
limbs
and
an
immense
quantity
of
blood
but
he
had
suffered
internal
injuries
and
a
severe
occipital
concussion
within
an
hour
in
spite
of
all
we
could
do
symptoms
of
lung
congestion
supervened
when
it
became
manifest
that
no
human
skill
could
save
i
wrote
a
note
to
miss
ottley
and
sent
lord
bill
to
london
to
escort
her
to
her
lover's
bedside
after
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
weldon
was
deep
in
a
state
of
coma
i
sat
down
beside
him
and
watched
his
poor
wan
face
every
few
minutes
i
administered
a
stimulant
yet
each
time
asked
myself
what
use
and
were
it
not
better
to
let
him
cross
the
bar
in
painless
sleep
than
try
to
bring
him
back
for
a
few
moments
to
the
agony
of
suffering
and
hopeless
separation
yet
i
was
plagued
with
the
most
hateful
doubts
and
ideas
and
so
beyond
expression
miserable
that
when
two
hours
had
gone
and
i
marked
his
pulse
failing
visibly
with
the
fleeting
minutes
i
did
that
at
length
which
perhaps
i
should
have
postponed
till
miss
ottley's
arrival
but
then
it
might
have
been
too
late
who
knows
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
me
i
could
hardly
see
for
sudden
womanish
tears
give
me
your
hand
he
whispered
i
did
so
and
he
pressed
within
it
a
hard
bulbous
object
put
in--in
your
pocket
keep
it
safe
he
gasped
it
will--ah
i
obeyed
him
without
glancing
at
what
he
had
given
me
then
i
got
up
and
rang
the
bell
a
great
change
had
come
over
him
the
surgeon
responded
to
my
call
it
is
the
end
he
said
weldon
broke
into
a
fit
of
coughing
and
beat
the
bedclothes
with
his
hands
we
bent
over
him
seeking
to
help
and
soothe
him
the
paroxysm
passed
and
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
sleep
soon
however
he
gave
a
strong
shudder
and
opened
his
eyes
again
pinsent--you
will
avenge
me--you
have
the
clue
he
said
it
was
but
a
breath
but
i
heard
yet
i
cannot
say
i
comprehended
indeed
i
thought
he
wandered
but
i
answered
softly
trust
me
lad
and
at
that
he
smiled
and
lay
still
gazing
up
at
me
with
eyes
of
deep
affection
i
have
sent
for
her
i
whispered
yes
he
sighed
i
know
but
she
will
be
too
late
tell
her--not
to
fret
and
at
the
last
word
the
light
faded
from
his
eyes
and
he
was
dead
long
afterwards
miss
ottley
came
into
the
room
she
was
pale
but
invincibly
composed
i
gave
her
his
message
and
left
her
alone
with
the
dead
the
owner
of
the
house
lord
bill
and
the
surgeon
led
me
out
into
the
garden
they
spoke
to
me
in
decorous
hushed
voices
for
a
while
then
let
me
be
i
walked
up
and
down
the
pathway
till
break
of
day
and
what
i
thought
about
i
cannot
tell
i
remember
being
closely
questioned
by
a
policeman
then
miss
ottley
took
my
arm
and
we
walked
to
the
station
i
thought
it
my
place
to
be
kind
to
her
yet
she
was
kind
to
me
one
might
think
you
cared
she
said
and
smiled
into
my
face
we
got
into
a
train
and
as
soon
as
it
started
lord
bill
broke
out
crying
he
declared
that
weldon
was
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
and
that
he
would
miss
him
dreadfully
then
he
said
in
the
midst
of
life
we
are
in
death
and
laughed
and
without
asking
permission
he
began
to
smoke
a
cigarette
it
is
strange
how
differently
people
are
affected
by
emotion
i
was
mentally
dazed
and
i
fancy
part
of
my
brain
was
benumbed
miss
ottley
was
poignantly
awake
but
her
pride
and
her
strength
of
mind
served
her
for
a
mask
lord
bill
on
the
other
hand
acted
as
responsively
to
his
feelings
as
an
infant
and
yet
each
of
us
behaved
naturally
i
reflected
on
these
things
all
the
way
to
town
lord
bill
bade
us
farewell
at
the
station
miss
ottley
and
i
drove
to
her
home
in
a
hansom
during
the
drive
she
spoke
about
the
funeral
quite
calmly
and
mentioned
poor
weldon's
love
for
big
red
roses
his
coffin
should
be
smothered
in
roses
she
declared
when
i
helped
her
to
the
pavement
she
pointed
up
at
a
window
that
was
open
dr
belleville's
room
she
said
and
smiled
he
is
enjoying
his
triumph
he
kept
his
word
to
the
letter
it
is
the
seventh
day
the
seventh
day
hugh
pinsent
that
is
a
terrible
man
how
shall
i
possibly
withstand
him
i
shook
my
head
you
are
wrong
i
answered
dully
he
is
not
responsible
for
this
it
was
an
accident
are
you
sure
she
asked
i
am
sure
of
nothing
i
replied
but
it
seems
to
me
an
accident--and
yet
but
there
i
am
incapable
of
reasoning
in
my
present
mood
i
shall
see
you
again
in
the
meanwhile--think
of
weldon's
last
words
to
you
and
do
not
grieve
too
much
and
you
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
i
have
never
felt
more
miserable
and
already
i
am
beginning
to
fancy
i
might
have
saved
him
how
by
going
yesterday
to
your
father
and
dr
belleville
and
forcing
them
at
the
muzzle
of
a
revolver
to
tell
me
things
they
know
and
which
i
want
to
know
you
rave
she
muttered
coldly
and
slowly
climbed
the
steps
i
followed
her
and
rang
the
bell
if
you
persist
in
thinking
my
father
a
bad
man
i
never
want
to
speak
to
you
again
she
whispered
there
were
steps
in
the
passage
i
took
off
my
hat
to
her
i
must
mend
my
thoughts
i
said
the
door
opened
and
dr
belleville
appeared
upon
the
threshold
the
girl
gave
him
a
quick
look
before
which
he
quailed
but
he
recovered
quickly
i
sincerely
trust
you
bring
good
news
he
said
in
tones
of
deep
concern
the
best
answered
miss
ottley
and
drawing
in
her
gown
she
swept
past
him
with
a
glance
of
bitter
hate
into
the
house
belleville
looked
after
her
then
turned
to
me
plucking
at
his
jetty
beard
and
frowning
heavily
weldon
is
better
he
inquired
he
is
dead
i
said
poor
poor
fellow
sighed
dr
belleville
i
am
greatly
pained
to
hear
it
you
were
his
friend
were
you
not
pinsent
i
can
see
that
you
are
upset
won't
you
come
in
and
have
a
glass
of
brandy
you
look
quite
done
up
no
thank
you
i
answered
i
must
get
home
and
change
these
bloodstained
clothes--there
is
to
be
an
inquest
this
afternoon
good-morning
good-morning
he
replied
he
was
staring
at
the
bloodstains
to
which
i
had
purposely
directed
his
attention
but
he
did
not
give
a
sign
of
agitation
his
face
remained
as
expressionless
as
wood
chapter
xx
lady
helen's
medicine
operates
on
arrival
at
jermyn
street
i
changed
my
clothes
and
having
collected
all
my
belongings
i
repaired
at
once
to
dixon
hubbard's
flat
i
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
spending
one
unnecessary
moment
in
my
poor
dead
friend's
abode
i
saw
his
honest
face
and
gay
mirth-filled
eyes
in
every
corner
and
he
smiled
at
me
from
every
dark
nook
and
shadow
of
the
trophy-covered
walls
hubbard
received
me
with
his
usual
frozen
politeness
he
was
still
in
bed
but
i
felt
an
overmastering
desire
for
human
sympathy
so
i
ignored
his
manner
and
told
him
what
had
passed
he
was
sorry
i
think
he
had
only
met
weldon
twice
and
had
merely
exchanged
a
word
or
two
with
him
but
he
admitted
having
felt
drawn
to
the
bright
and
manly
lad
and
though
he
said
little
it
could
be
seen
that
he
was
shocked
to
hear
of
a
death
so
untimely
and
on
all
accounts
so
utterly
regrettable
and
he
strove
to
cheer
me
in
his
way
after
a
long
silence
he
suddenly
remarked
on
the
iron-bound
remorselessness
of
fate
there
he
said
was
a
young
fellow
just
about
to
taste
his
cup
of
long-anticipated
happiness
a
man
with
many
friends
and
no
enemies
universally
liked
and
respected
yet
destiny
without
warning
dashed
the
cup
for
ever
from
his
lips
and
one
cannot
console
oneself
with
the
reflection
that
he
has
been
spared
the
pain
and
shame
of
finding
the
contents
bitter-sweet
and
mixed
with
dregs
for
the
girl
loved
him
i
am
told
and
she
was
good
to
look
upon
and
honest-hearted
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
omar
laughingly
declares
that
the
potter
is
a
good
fellow
and
'twill
all
be
well
but
how
many
pots
have
encountered
that
experience
have
i--though
still
i'm
here
and
you
i'm
all
awry
the
potter's
hand
shook
in
making
me
as
for
you
you
started
straight
but
you
grow
more
crooked
every
day
and
it's
not
your
fault
you
are
a
helpless
dough
puppet
in
the
hands
of
destiny
you
think
i
grow
crooked
i
asked
surprised
mentally
morally
he
answered
with
a
sneer
you
picked
a
foolish
quarrel
to
leave
me
and
now
you
are
back
again
why
can
you
tell
me
i
have
a
theory
he
said
with
kindly
eyes
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong
my
wife
has
become
interested
in
you
she
has
marked
you
for
a
victim
at
first
you
were
unwilling
you
could
not
even
bear
to
be
near
me
but
now
you
are
more
callous
you
are
wrong
i
replied--then
suddenly
remembered
that
i
had
given
a
solemn
promise
to
lady
helen
no
doubt
hubbard
marked
the
change
in
my
expression
his
sneer
grew
more
pronounced
but
i
had
a
task
to
get
through
somehow
lady
helen
with
all
due
deference
to
you
hubbard
i
said
slowly
is
not
a
woman
i
could
ever
care
about
i
feel
certain
she
is
even
less
interested
in
me
than
i
am
in
her
but
even
were
the
reverse
the
case
with
her
as
you
suspect
what
odds
i
have
the
utmost
contempt
for
her
and
i
think
that
she
deserves--but
there
you
have
the
misfortune
to
be
her
husband
so
i'll
say
no
more
his
face
was
scarlet
what
reason
have
you
to
despise
her
he
demanded
is
it
not
enough
that
she
has
most
unwarrantably
caused
you
a
great
deal
of
unhappiness
i
retorted
besides
you
have
told
me
sufficient
of
her
character
to
convince
me
that
she
is
one
of
those
flighty
butterfly
women
whom
all
honest
men
regard
with
only
one
step
short
of
loathing
and
you
are
an
honest
man
he
sneered
i
try
to
be
i
answered
modestly
he
was
furious
in
order
to
hide
it
he
sprang
out
of
bed
flung
on
his
dressing-gown
and
rushed
to
the
bath
i
thought
of
lady
helen's
acute
prevision
of
the
event
and
almost
contrived
to
smile
hubbard
had
come
within
an
ace
of
defending
his
defamed
wife
with
naked
fists
on
my
impertinent
face
according
to
the
simple
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
primeval
unlettered
aborigines
we
tabooed
the
subject
by
tacit
consent
for
the
remainder
of
the
forenoon
but
hubbard
announced
his
intention
of
accompanying
me
to
the
inquest
and
as
soon
as
we
were
seated
in
the
train
he
opened
fire
again
i
am
afraid
i
have
given
you
an
exaggerated
idea
of
lady
helen's
shortcomings
he
commenced
looking
anywhere
but
at
me
i
am
afraid
i
have
created
a
false
impression
in
your
mind
i
don't
want
you
to
consider
her
entirely
blameworthy
pinsent
if
she
were
that
i
should
long
ago
have
ceased
to
care
a
pin
for
her
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
looked
out
of
the
window
he
went
on
presently
i'm
afraid
pinsent
i
have
done
a
foolish
thing
perhaps
even
a
caddish
thing
in
telling
you
anything
about
our
private
quarrel
it
did
not
occur
to
me
at
the
time
that
i
might
prejudice
you
against
her
to
be
honest
there
were
faults
on
both
sides
and
if
you
knew
all
you
might
consider
me
the
more
deserving
of
censure
her
the
more
deserving
of
pity
my
dear
old
chap
i
answered
solemnly
have
i
known
you
all
these
years
for
nothing
all
you
have
said
only
the
more
assures
me
of
your
chivalry
and
generosity
and
tenderness
of
heart
and
makes
me
feel
the
angrier
at
her
insensate
incapacity
to
appreciate
your
qualities
i
grant
you
that
you
hide
yourself
at
times
behind
a
mask
of
surliness
but
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
any
true
woman
any
woman
indeed
even
such
a
frivolous
creature
as
she
has
proved
herself
to
be
could
have
failed
to
penetrate
so
transparent
a
disguise
i
can't
believe
it
my
boy
in
my
opinion
lady
helen
knows
you
perfectly
for
what
you
are
but
instead
of
responding
with
an
equal
or
similar
nobility
of
mind
at
the
instance
of
her
innate
selfishness
she
is
using
her
knowledge
to
put
upon
you
to
hurt
you
to
trifle
with
you
and
to
drain
your
purse
all
that
she
may
pass
the
sort
of
existence
she
prefers
without
the
wheel-brake
of
your
tutelage
hubbard
moved
uncomfortably
in
his
seat
he
frowned
and
bit
his
lip
then
he
coughed
and
put
up
a
hand
to
his
brow
damme
at
length
he
blurted
out
you're
as
wrong
as
you
can
be
it
was
i
who
insisted
on
the
separation
but
she
forced
you
to
it
she
broke
her
marriage
vow
of
obedience
by
refusing
to
accept
the
rules
of
life
that
you
had
planned
i
prescribed
conditions
which
she
characterised
as
grossly
unreasonable
and
unfair
i
am
by
no
means
sure
now
that
she
was
not
right
nonsense
hubbard
it's
a
woman's
first
duty
to
obey
and
cleave
to
her
husband
at
all
costs
and
whatever
be
the
consequences
or
fancied
consequences
to
her
comfort
or
convenience
marriage
imposes
that
obligation
on
the
woman
in
its
sacramental
character
it
is
a
sacred
obligation
and
it
cannot
be
violated
without
the
guilt
of
crime
i
could
have
no
mercy
on
such
a
criminal
hubbard
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
threw
back
the
lapels
he
seemed
hot
he
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
began
to
fan
himself
with
a
newspaper
lord
he
muttered
what
strait-laced
ideas
you
have
of
matrimony
upon
my
soul
i
cannot
follow
you
they
are
out
of
date
there
was
a
time
perhaps
when
they
were
necessary
but
now
my
dear
hugh
you
should
reconsider
the
matter
your
views
are
somewhat
narrow
for
years
past
the
world
has
been
allowing
an
ever-increasing
license
to
woman
and
who
shall
say
that
it
is
wrong
woman
is
a
reasoning
responsible
being
i----
nonsense
hubbard
i
interrupted
woman
is
the
weaker
vessel
and
the
more
she
is
restricted
the
better
for
her
own
protection
look
at
the
divorce
court
thousands
of
marriages
are
every
year
dissolved
that
is
all
owing
to
the
greater
freedom
which
men
have
conceded
woman
of
latter
years
divorce
was
comparatively
speaking
an
unknown
quantity
when
men
asserted
the
right
to
confine
their
wives
in
proper
bounds
and
forced
them
to
observe
and
practise
the
domestic
virtues
both
for
occupation
and
amusement
look
around
you
and
consider
what
has
been
brought
about
by
the
unwise
relaxation
of
the
old
sound
laws
a
race
of
social
moths
and
drones
and
gad-flies
has
been
created
whose
chief
business
in
life
it
is
to
amuse
themselves
whose
pleasure
it
is
to
spend
money
often
earned
with
difficulty
by
devoted
fools
whose
delight
it
is
to
ensnare
and
to
deceive
their
former
tyrants
whose
estimate
of
motherhood
is
an
avoidable
and
loathsome
human
incident
whose
morality
is
a
resolution
to
preserve
their
immorality
from
public
criticism
whose
faith
is
a
shibboleth
composed
of
superstitious
formulã¦
and
whose
religion
is
occasionally
to
attend
divine
service
in
some
fashionable
church
arrayed
in
the
latest
thing
in
headgear
and
a
chic
french
gown
hubbard
straightened
his
shoulders
his
expression
had
grown
quite
superior
during
my
tirade
and
when
it
was
over
it
was
plain
that
he
looked
down
on
me
from
the
heights
of
a
philosophic
aconcagua
i
would
not
advertise
those
opinions
if
i
were
you
he
observed
with
a
slight
sneer
they
have
a
grain
of
truth
in
them
but
not
enough
to
conceal
the
brand
of
special
advocate
i
suppose
you
do
not
wish
to
be
regarded
as
a
social
reformer
i
shall
be
content
to
reform
one
woman--if
ever
i
marry
i
answered
with
a
straight
face
though
it
was
hard
to
keep
it
straight
she
has
my
unmeasured
sympathy
said
hubbard
once
upon
a
time
i
was
a
woman-hater--but
in
my
most
uncharitable
moments
i
was
never
such
a
fool
as
you
you
will
forgive
my
plain
speaking
certainly
hubbard
certainly
you
are
not
responsible
it
is
plain
to
me
that
lady
helen
has
bewitched
you
one
of
these
days
you'll
be
lauding
her
as
a
creature
of
incomparable
excellences--a
very
paragon
of
merit
and
a
pattern
of
the
virtues
i
can
see
it
coming
i
am
sorry
for
of
course
i
know
what
she
is
hubbard
turned
crimson
he
snapped
his
teeth
together
and
rapped
out
see
here
pinsent
we
are
very
old
friends
but
i'll
be
damned
if
i
allow
you
to
disparage
my
wife
is
that
plain
i
took
out
my
cigarette
case
perfectly
i
murmured
he
glared
at
me
for
a
moment
then
scowled
still
more
blackly
and
growled
deep
in
throat
i
can't
think
what
has
come
over
you
you
haven't
the
least
right
or
cause
to
hate
her
it's
positively
unmanly
especially
as
she
thinks
of
you
far
more
highly
than
you
deserve
she
feels
it
too
you
must
have
shown
her
how
you
regard
her
she
made
me
feel
a
brute
look
here
hubbard
i
cried
with
a
nicely
assumed
show
of
indignation
i
want
to
oblige
you
and
i
want
to
keep
the
peace
between
us
but
i
shan't
be
able
to
if
you
keep
on
defending
her
when
you
know
as
well
as
i----
what
he
thundered
that
she
is
a
butterfly
i
thundered
back
she
is
not
he
shouted
she
is
i
said
you
you
you
imbecile
spluttered
my
poor
friend
i
tell
you
once
and
for
all
that
is
only
one
phase
of
her
i
don't
like
it
i
admit
he
began
to
cool
off
but
still
it
is
only
a
phase
she
is
in
reality
a
woman
of
great
depth
of
character
he
was
quite
cool
by
this
i
had
a
conversation
with
her
the
other
night
that
astonished
me
of
course
i
have
always
known
that
she
is
an
educated
woman
but
the
extent
of
her
knowledge
had
previously
escaped
me
she
has
a
much
more
than
superficial
acquaintance
with
the
modern
forms
of
speculative
philosophy
she
has
read
kant
and
spencer
and
nietzsche
with
understanding
and
she
is
now
engaged
in
the
study
of
egyptian
history
you
have
interested
her
deeply
in
the
subject
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
from
all
this
you
conclude
that
i
have
been
an
idiot
not
to
recognise
long
ago
that
she
is
my
intellectual
equal
and
i
have
treated
her
as
if
she
were
an
irresponsible
child
but
she
is
a
woman
quite
so
replied
this
converted
woman-hater
and
because
she
is
a
woman
and
such
a
woman
she
has
the
power
to
bless
the
man
fortunate
enough
to
win
her--her
affection--as
few
men
are
blessed
now
you
can
appreciate
my
position
i
have
blindly
sacrificed
my
chance
i----
pish
i
interrupted
tell
her
what
you
have
told
me
and
be
blessed
you'll
repent
it
all
your
life
through
it
is
too
late
he
groaned
i
have
been
weighed
in
the
balance
and
found
wanting
pride
if
nothing
else
would
always
prevent
her
from
forgiving
me
she--liked
me
once
i
think--but
now----
he
cleared
his
throat
and
forced
a
wry
smile
she
looks
upon
me
as
her
treasurer
and
friend
it
was
my
own
choice
i
have
no
right
to
grumble
then
he
burst
out
suddenly
but
it's
damnable
pinsent
damnable
lady
helen's
medicine
was
working
like
a
charm
i
thought
it
best
to
let
well
enough
alone
so
i
made
a
rude
effort
and
changed
the
conversation
we
soon
reached
our
journey's
end
the
inquest
was
a
nightmare
dreamed
by
day
the
courtroom
was
filled
with
poor
weldon's
relatives
his
father
the
old
baron
ostentatiously
turned
his
back
on
me
he
seemed
to
think
me
in
some
way
responsible
for
his
son's
fate
weldon's
sisters
too
whom
i
knew
slightly
vouchsafed
me
no
sign
of
recognition
his
younger
brother--now
the
heir--was
the
only
member
of
the
family
who
extended
the
slightest
token
of
civility
he
was
so
manifestly
delighted
at
the
unlooked-for
promotion
of
his
prospects
that
i
read
in
his
warm
hand-grip
a
secret
pã¦an
of
joy
he
had
been
intended
for
that
limbo
of
younger
sons
and
blue-blooded
incompetents
the
bar
happily
the
inquest
was
soon
over
i
was
only
in
the
box
five
minutes
and
a
quarter-hour
later
the
verdict
was
recorded
accidental
death
hubbard
and
i
returned
at
once
to
london
there
arrived
i
plunged
into
work
upon
my
book
and
for
a
space
of
two
days
i
managed
to
forget
that
the
world
contained
anything
but
steles
and
obelisks
and
mural
hieroglyphic
inscriptions
which
though
always
half
obliterate
with
time
had
somehow
or
other
to
be
made
sense
of
and
translated
into
english
prose
chapter
xxi
hubbard's
philosophy
of
life
weldon's
funeral
was
held
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
following
his
death
his
body
was
interred
in
the
vault
of
his
family
at
their
seat
at
sartley
in
norfolk
i
was
not
invited
to
attend
but
i
felt
i
had
to
go
miss
ottley
was
there
with
her
father
and
dr
belleville
she
was
clad
in
deep
mourning
and
her
face
was
thickly
veiled
one
of
weldon's
sisters
sobbed
throughout
the
ceremony
yet
i
do
not
think
she
felt
her
brother's
loss
half
as
deeply
as
i
did
i
heard
her
whisper
to
her
neighbour
once--between
sobs--i
knelt
immediately
behind
her--have
you
ever
seen
such
callousness--not
a
tear
not
a
sigh
she
was
referring
to
miss
ottley
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
on
the
cliffs
beside
the
sea
i
did
not
wish
to
return
by
the
same
train
as
the
ottleys
but
destiny
ruled
otherwise
although
i
waited
for
the
last
it
seemed
that
sir
robert
had
overtaxed
his
strength
and
had
been
obliged
to
rest
i
had
hardly
taken
my
seat
when
he
was
helped
into
the
same
compartment
by
belleville
and
the
porter
they
made
him
comfortable
with
cushions
without
observing
me
but
miss
ottley
started
as
she
entered
and
raised
her
veil
you
she
muttered
then
paused
as
if
in
doubt
eyeing
belleville
a
second
later
she
let
fall
her
veil
again
and
sat
beside
me
without
asking
anyone's
permission
belleville
turned
down
the
light
leaving
the
compartment
in
comparative
obscurity
the
porter
muttered
thanks
for
the
tip
and
departing
locked
the
door
plainly
my
presence
had
passed
unnoticed
but
an
exclamation
from
belleville
soon
showed
he
had
discovered
me
excuse
me
sir
he
said
this
carriage
has
been
specially
reserved
then
he
recognised
me
oh
he
cried
you--but----
but
the
train
had
begun
to
move
i
sank
back
in
my
corner
belleville
took
the
corner
opposite
in
a
few
minutes
sir
robert
complained
of
the
light
in
the
manner
of
a
sick
man
belleville
sprang
up
and
put
it
out
altogether
the
darkness
now
was
absolute
if
you
will
take
this
side
i
can
make
you
comfortable
there
is
a
cushion
to
spare
said
belleville's
voice
he
was
not
addressing
me
i
prefer
to
remain
where
i
am
thank
you
said
miss
ottley
in
a
frigid
tone
belleville
sat
down
silently
now
and
then
i
caught
the
glimmer
of
his
eyes
from
the
reflection
of
passing
lights
or
the
glow
of
the
engine
smoke
and
steam
wind-blown
beside
the
train
he
was
staring
into
the
corner
which
i
occupied
i
felt
his
hatred
wrap
and
heat
me
like
a
coat
composed
of
nettles
and
the
man
had
occasion
for
ere
long
miss
ottley's
hand
stole
to
mine
and
she
sighed
when
mine
enclosed
and
pressed
it
close
belleville
could
not
have
known
yet
he
must
have
felt
we
were
in
sympathy
opposed
to
him--just
as
i
felt
his
hostile
influence
it
was
a
silent
ride
but
not
uninteresting
twice
belleville
unexpectedly
struck
a
match
and
flashed
it
in
our
faces
but
my
rug
covered
the
occupation
of
our
hands
once
instinct
warned
me
that
he
was
bending
forward
peering
and
prying
i
raised
my
foot
and
brushed
it
in
his
beard
he
fell
back
coughing
to
prevent
himself
from
cursing
it
was
in
that
moment
probably
that
he
resolved
upon
my
death
for
i
was
unable
to
restrain
a
low
grim
laugh
sir
robert
slept
always
even
when
we
paused
at
stations
on
the
road
at
those
times
belleville
and
i
exchanged
pretty
courtesies
he
would
offer
me
his
flask
or
i
would
offer
him
a
cigarette
we
both
refused
these
charming
civilities
but
our
manner
was
so
densely
sugar-coated
that
there
might
have
been
detected
by
a
skilled
psychometrist
a
scent
of
honey
in
the
air
and
our
eyes
beamed
upon
each
other
with
the
sweetest
friendliness
needless
to
say
whenever
the
engine
whistled
or
the
train
slowed
down
miss
ottley's
hand
left
mine
she
only
spoke
to
me
once
and
that
was
on
the
london
platform
while
belleville
was
assisting
her
father
from
the
car
do
not
go
out
ever
between
three
and
five
she
muttered
behind
her
veil
without
looking
at
me
i
shall
come
as
soon
as
i
can
do
not
call
on
me
do
not
reply
just
say
good-bye
well--if
you'll
allow
me
i'll
say
good-bye
miss
ottley
i
announced
in
ordinary
tones
you
might
be
good
enough
to
let
me
know
your
opinion
of
my
book
at
your
leisure
for
i
value
your
opinion
you
will
have
an
advance
copy
in
a
week
or
two
most
certainly
dr
pinsent
it
is
kind
of
you
to
remember
your
promise
good-bye
i
lifted
my
hat
and
left
her
nodding
to
belleville
as
i
passed
he
looked
surprised
also
distrustful
but
he
said
something
polite
sir
robert
saw
me
but
chose
to
ignore
my
existence
i
walked
home
to
bruton
street
and
found
hubbard
ensconced
before
the
fire
the
night
was
chilly
enough
to
warrant
one
despite
the
season
he
was
staring
gloomily
into
the
heart
of
the
glowing
coals
i
helped
myself
to
a
glass
of
whisky
and
took
an
armchair
beside
him
i
can't
stand
this
i'll
go
abroad
he
announced
at
the
end
of
a
good
half
hour
what's
the
matter
hubbard
oh
i've
been
there
again
i
couldn't
keep
away
she
was
alone
for
a
wonder
you
refer
to
your
wife
i
suppose
well
he
allowed
me
to
finish
my
cigar
before
replying
then
he
said
i
have
no
business
to
tell
you
but
i
shall
she
is
in
love
and
i
believe
with
you
nonsense
i
wish
it
were
he
answered
dreamily
but
it
is
not
she
has
practically
admitted
it
that--she
cares
for
me
i
cried
no--but
for
someone
and
i
am
not
so
great
a
fool
that
i
cannot
read
between
the
lines
although
she
thinks
so
her
thoughts
dwell
constantly
on
you
impossible
he
turned
and
gazed
at
me
it's
so
old
man
upon
my
honour
you
are
mistaken
dixon
i
know
you
are
as
true
as
steel
he
muttered
that
is
why
i
do
not
even
feel
a
wish
to
thwart
the
fates
i
am
nothing
but
an
interloper
a
marplot
i
ought
to
efface
myself
when
i
am
strong
enough
i
shall
but
i
wish
you'd
be
frank
with
me--hugh
entirely
frank
you
think
you
despise
her
now
but
you
are
sure
you
have
no
other
feeling
deep
at
heart
think
well
before
you
answer
hugh
why
because
if
i
were
sure
that
you
cared
too
i
would
find
my
happiness
in
helping
you
are
worthy
of
her--and
she--as
god
hears
me
is
worthy
of
the
best
man
living
dixon
dixon
oh
i
know
this
must
sound
oddly
from
my
lips
but
though
i've
been
a
fool
i'm
wiser
now
i
hold
a
purer
finer
faith
a
human
faith
and
it
is
now
my
deep
belief
that
the
greatest
crime
of
all
is
the
prevention
of
the
fullest
union
of
predestined
mates--and
all
that
sin
entails--the
birth
of
children
generated
by
the
fires
of
lust
and
hate
upon
the
copperplate
of
physical
and
psychical
indifference
the
production
of
a
race
prenatally
ordained
to
be
degenerates
the
determination
of
unhappy
souls
galled
into
madness
by
their
chains--their
ultimate
destruction
he
got
suddenly
afoot
and
raised
his
hands
on
high
i
tell
you
hugh
he
cried
with
eyes
afire
there
is
no
surer
way
to
damnation
no
surer
path
we
are
born
into
this
world
for
one
strong
purpose
which
is
told
us
by
our
hearts
if
we
will
hear
them
and
this
concerns
ourselves
not
half
so
much
as
our
potentialities
of
helping
by
their
proper
use
the
unborn
spirits
placed
by
providence
at
our
control
and
mercy
it
is
then
for
us
to
choose
if
we
will
be
servants
of
the
good
to
assist
in
their
perfection
or
the
servants
of
the
evil
to
promote
their
desolation
and
to
advance
the
stages
of
their
ruin
no
human
being
has
the
right
to
bring
any
but
a
love
child
into
the
world
that
which
is
not
a
love
child
is
a
child
of
hate
there
is
no
course
between
and
because
the
father
of
a
child
of
hate
is
a
criminal
for
whom
there
is
no
punishment
conceivable
to
a
finite
mind
acute
enough
on
earth
his
expiation
of
his
crime
will
but
begin
at
death
you
laugh
at
me
on
the
contrary
i
answered
gravely
i
accord
with
you
then
you
admit
my
duty
i
should
stand
aside
ay--but
first
be
sure
my
friend
you
love
your
wife
she
may
love
you
i
am
sure
that
she
does
not
but
you
it
is
time
hugh
that
you
answered
me
i
stood
up
and
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
i
love
with
all
my
strength
another
woman
i
said
slowly
and
just
as
sure
i
am
that
i
love
her
am
i
that
she
loves
me
are
you
answered
he
stared
at
me
and
in
the
moment
that
my
eyes
held
his
his
face
grew
dull
and
grey
my
poor
helen
he
muttered
i
had
hoped
to
help
her
to
her
happiness
at--any
cost
i
demanded
yes
yes
he
said
death
i
would
have
welcomed
it
he
groaned
and
turning
he
went
slowly
from
the
room
he
walked
like
an
old
old
man
i
had
never
admired
him
so
little
nor
liked
and
pitied
him
so
much
straightway
i
wrote
a
note
to
lady
helen
and
going
out
posted
it
myself
it
contained
only
these
three
words
it
is
time
i
could
trust
a
woman
of
her
proven
cleverness
to
understand
chapter
xxii
the
dead
hand
i
expected
miss
ottley
next
afternoon
and
hubbard
as
though
aware
i
wished
to
be
alone
went
out
soon
after
three
but
she
did
not
come
hubbard
returned
an
hour
after
midnight
he
kept
me
awake
by
tramping
about
his
room
until
far
into
the
small
hours
next
morning
i
found
the
library
filled
with
corded
boxes
and
hubbard's
man
padlocking
the
last
of
them
master's
gone
to
france
and
i'm
to
follow
he
announced
with
an
air
of
suppressed
exultation
he
left
this
letter
for
you
the
letter
contained
these
lines
i
know
you
at
length
for
the
cunning
scamp
you
are
how
you
must
have
laughed
at
me
but
i
forgive
you
we
shall
be
away
a
year
at
least
as
always
everything
i
have
is
yours
let
us
find
you
here
on
our
return
i
cannot
write
more
my
heart
is
too
full
pinsent
she
loves
me
d
h
the
last
three
words
were
deeply
underlined
by
the
end
of
that
week
i
had
completed
the
revision
of
my
book
and
forwarded
the
manuscript
to
mr
coen
afterwards
i
was
uncomfortably
lonely
and
unoccupied
i
waited
in
from
three
to
five
every
afternoon
but
no
one
came
the
rest
of
the
days
i
spent
wandering
about
the
streets
nursing
the
long
sickness
of
too
much
thinking
the
end
of
it
was
i
disobeyed
miss
ottley
and
went
one
afternoon
to
call
on
her
i
might
as
well
have
saved
myself
the
trouble
she
was
out
likewise
her
father
and
dr
belleville
two
days
later
i
called
again
again
everyone
was
out
then
i
wrote
a
guarded
note
and
sent
it
with
an
advance
copy
of
my
book
asking
for
an
expression
of
her
opinion
after
much
waiting
i
received
a
long
typewritten
disquisition
challenging
on
apocryphal
authority
my
attribution
of
a
stele
superscribed
by
amen-aken
to
the
fourteenth
dynasty
it
was
signed
by
miss
ottley
but
i
failed
to
recognise
it
as
her
composition
one
evening
however
having
nothing
else
to
do
i
applied
to
its
verbiage
the
simple
rules
of
a
well-known
cipher
this
gave
me
an
astonishing
result
impossible
see
you
without
endangering
your
life
constant
supervision
but
it
was
worth
testing
the
matter
further
i
therefore
composed
a
formal
reply
to
the
challenge
showing
my
reasons
for
concluding
that
amen-aken
had
unwarrantably
altered
for
purposes
of
his
own
glorification
the
historic
record
of
a
predecessor
i
used
the
same
cipher
and
embodied
the
following
message
by
its
aid
shall
pass
the
house
before
midnight
friday
throw
letter
from
window
explaining
all
i
live
to
serve
you
this
document
i
forwarded
to
miss
ottley
enclosed
in
a
letter
in
which
i
took
pains
to
show
that
i
had
been
disappointed
by
her
criticism
and
that
i
was
not
anxious
for
the
correspondence
to
be
continued
then
i
waited
as
patiently
as
possible
for
friday
to
come
round
the
hours
passed
with
leaden
feet
but
they
passed--and
midnight
found
me
in
the
lane
walking
slowly
by
the
house
it
was
wrapped
in
gloom
from
roof
to
basement
but
her
window
was
open
as
the
clocks
began
to
chime
a
white
thing
flashed
out
and
fluttered
to
my
feet
it
was
a
kerchief
weighted
with
a
golden
bracelet
i
felt
a
paper
crinkle
in
its
folds
hastily
concealing
it
within
my
coat
i
pressed
on
and
returned
by
a
circuitous
route
to
bruton
street
soon
i
was
poring
over
my
treasure
it
was
typewritten
like
the
challenge
it
read
i
have
been
obliged
to
typewrite
this
because
i
am
a
close
prisoner
and
am
forbidden
the
use
of
pen
or
pencil
but
they
make
me
work
as
their
stenographer
some
hours
each
day--and
i
was
forced
to
seize
the
opportunity
so
presented
thank
god
you
understood
the
cipher
if
you
love
me
give
out
that
you
proceed
immediately
to
egypt
then
go
to
paris
and
return
to
london
under
another
name
and
well
disguised
take
lodgings
east
and
wait
until
you
see
in
personal
column
of
daily
wire
directions
addressed
to
'd
menchikoff'
follow
them
implicitly
am
in
power
of
fiends
open
opposition
perilous
must
allay
suspicion
otherwise
forced
immediate
marriage
b
here
the
missive
ended
i
sat
down
before
the
fire
and
thought
hard
for
some
minutes
the
paper
was
crunched
up
in
my
hand
suddenly
the
door
opened
i
turned
my
head
at
the
sound
of
the
creak
but
could
see
no
one
what
could
have
opened
the
door
i
heard
the
sound
of
caught
breath
a
foot
on
the
door
and
a
sigh
in
a
flash
i
understood
i
had
been
seen
by
my
enemies
picking
up
the
letter
in
the
street
and
they
had
sent
their
invisible
messenger
to
win
it
from
me
quick
as
thought
i
thrust
the
paper
in
the
flames
and
sprang
afoot
there
followed
a
deep-voiced
oath
and
a
rush
of
air
fanned
my
face
i
struck
out
with
all
my
strength
right
and
left
half
beside
myself
with
rage
and
fear
but
my
blows
encountered
nothing
tangible
and
a
second
later
the
door
banged
shut
i
was
so
unnerved
that
i
simply
walked
over
and
locked
it
how
can
a
man
fight
with
an
enemy
he
cannot
see
or
even
follow
him
when
my
hands
stopped
shaking
i
began
to
pack
up
my
trunks
i
resolved
to
follow
miss
ottley's
bidding
to
the
letter
to-morrow
i
would
announce
my
departure
for
egypt
and
cross
the
channel
in
order
to
put
belleville
off
the
track
meanwhile
i
ransacked
my
wardrobe
presently
i
received
a
shock
from
an
unremembered
corner
in
a
chest
i
brought
out
the
clothes
i
had
worn
on
the
day
of
poor
weldon's
death
they
were
covered
with
dyed
bloodstains
the
blood
of
my
dead
friend
i
placed
them
on
the
table
and
eyed
them
shuddering
my
mind
as
if
spell-compelled
reviewed
all
the
details
of
weldon's
death
i
saw
him
stagger
back
back
and
fall
beneath
the
wheels
of
the
onrushing
locomotive
i
heard
his
dying
shriek
once
more
i
struggled
desperately
but
alas
how
vainly
with
the
dark
angel
for
his
life
once
more
as
the
end
approached
i
saw
his
glazed
eyes
open
and
look
into
mine
once
more
i
heard
his
dying
words--give
me
your
hand
and
but--god
in
heaven
how
could
i
ever
have
forgotten
it
had
he
not
given
me
something--something
i
had
put
in
my
pocket
half
unconsciously
without
looking
to
see
what
it
was--something
he
had
implored
me
to
keep
safe
i
felt
my
senses
rock
at
the
recollection
and
then
i
went
hot
all
over
with
shame
to
think
of
my
neglect
my
inattention
until
that
moment--despite
his
dying
direction
i
had
utterly
forgotten
his
sad
trust
and
the
thing
he
had
given
me
to
keep--where
was
it
now
where
indeed
but
in
the
pocket
of
that
coat
where
i
had
placed
it
oh
it
was
safe
enough
no
doubt--but
that
did
not
absolve
me
for
weeks
i
had
been
a
recreant
trustee
i
had
i
saw
it
now
i
had
been
a
coward
i
felt
his
death
so
much
that
i
had
resolutely
put
all
thoughts
of
him
aside
smothered
them
with
work
fearing
the
misery
which
they
must
bring
and
i
had
been
his
friend
i
took
up
the
coat
and
felt
in
the
pocket
yes
it
was
there
what
was
it
i
drew
it
out
before
the
light
and
saw
nothing
yet
i
held
something
heavy
and
hard
was
i
going
mad
was
my
sight
diseased
or
what
i
rubbed
my
eyes
and
looked
again
nothing
i
strode
over
to
the
gas
jet
and
held
the
thing
between
my
visual
organs
and
the
flame
ah
something
now
but
how
describe
it
i
saw
a
small
light
blur
a
sort
of
shapeless
haze
off
which
the
rays
the
jet
of
light
diffused
recoiled
obliquely
it
was
not
transparent
but
neither
was
it
in
the
true
sense
visible
it
seemed
to
defy
the
light
rays
to
repulse
them
rather
than
absorb
them
when
held
directly
before
the
flame
i
could
not
see
the
gas
jet
through
it
and
yet
itself
i
could
not
truly
see
it
confused
and
disarranged
my
vision
as
a
watery
mote
does
floating
on
the
surface
of
an
eyeball
slowly
and
surely
experimenting
with
the
thing
i
found
that
the
farther
i
withdrew
it
from
the
lamp
the
less
sensibly
my
sense
became
aware
of
its
existence
but
when
i
placed
it
directly
against
the
lamp
the
flame
became
mysteriously
obscured
i
say
mysteriously
because
the
thing
cast
no
discoverable
shadow
and
although
solid
to
the
sense
of
touch
it
was
not
otherwise
apparently
opaque
the
flame
still
burned
behind
it
and
i
still
saw
the
flame
yet
not
through
but
over
and
around
an
intermediate
blur
in
that
connection
the
thing
did
not
resemble
glass
had
the
reverse
been
the
case
i
should
have
seen
the
flame
through
it
directly
as
it
was
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
the
impression
of
the
flame
was
conveyed
to
my
retina
by
rays
of
light
that
did
not
travel
in
a
straight
path
they
climbed
over
and
surrounded
the
interposed
object
first
and
thus
gave
me
a
slightly
distorted
image
of
the
flame
and
instead
of
revealing
the
obstacle
which
they
had
to
overcome
in
transit
all
they
did
was
to
indicate
vaguely
its
situation
thus
above
and
below
the
indiscernible
point
where
their
straight
and
proper
course
was
interfered
with
i
perceived
a
misty
indefinable
haze
and
at
the
point
where
the
rays
seemed
to
reassemble
and
readjust
themselves
to
the
resumption
of
their
ordinary
business
there
was
a
blur
perhaps
the
best
way
to
depict
the
effect
was
to
present
the
hypothesis
of
a
weak
flame
held
up
before
a
stronger
one
this
does
not
exactly
describe
the
phenomenon
i
witnessed
and
investigated
but
it
approximates
as
closely
as
i
can
manage
the
chief
points
of
difference
are
that
every
flame
casts
a
shadow
and
this
thing
did
not
unless
a
blur
of
light
be
a
shadow
and
furthermore
a
flame
may
be
seen
even
confronted
with
a
stronger
flame
and
this
thing
i
held
was
destitute
of
a
perceptible
outline
the
pity
was
that
i
was
then
working
without
a
single
clue
to
any
comprehension
of
the
thing
and
the
greater
pity
is
that
though
my
knowledge
became
fuller
i
am
still
ignorant
of
the
action
of
the
properties
which
made
the
thing
visually
impalpable
i
can
only
guess
at
them
but
i
think
i
guess
correctly
when
i
conjecturally
assert
that
it
was
surface
coated
with
some
essence
which
had
the
power
to
compel
the
great
majority
of
the
light
rays
to
travel
along
its
sides
and
surface
and
to
resume
their
original
direction
afterwards
i
do
not
pretend
to
understand
how
this
essence
could
so
interfere
with
and
control
the
laws
of
light
but
granting
that
it
could
the
explanation
is
a
natural
one
and
though
scientists
may
frown
at
me
for
advancing
a
theory
which
i
am
unable
to
substantiate
i
prefer
to
incur
their
scorn
rather
than
adopt
the
alternative--supernatural
agency
i
simply
decline
to
believe
in
the
supernatural
it
is
my
profound
conviction
that
nothing
has
ever
happened
on
this
planet
however
mysterious
and
inexplicable
which
has
not
been
produced
by
a
purely
and
perfectly
natural
cause
and
the
longer
i
live
the
more
certain
do
i
become
that
deep
and
wonderful
as
our
scientific
acquaintance
with
nature
undoubtedly
is
we
have
not
yet
even
thoroughly
explored
the
porch
of
her
palace
of
secrets
her
vast
treasure-house
of
wonders
but
i
stray
from
my
subject
it
is
my
present
business
to
relate
events
not
to
discuss
their
basic
principles
to
resume
then
after
a
great
while
spent
in
experimenting
with
the
thing
which
poor
weldon
had
given
me
before
the
light
i
was
obliged
to
confess
myself
baffled
i
then
fell
back
upon
my
other
four
senses
i
got
out
a
pair
of
scales
and
weighed
the
thing
it
weighed
exactly
seven
ounces
then
i
smelt
it
the
thing
was
odourless
i
bit
it
but
it
was
tasteless
yet
it
yielded
to
my
teeth
like
stiff
rubber
or
leather
next
i
placed
it
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
traced
its
outlines
with
a
pencil
that
was
the
first
really
definite
result
i
got
the
tracing
showed
a
bulbous
object
four
inches
wide
by
five
long
it
was
shaped
something
like
a
pear
its
base
contained
four
indentations
with
corresponding
rounded
protuberances
like
knuckles
the
apex
was
ragged
next
i
took
a
knife
and
with
the
blade
scratched
its
surface
a
moment
later
a
long
streak
of
dark
dry
tissue
was
revealed
i
could
see
it
plainly
i
shook
all
over
with
excitement
the
mystery
seemed
to
be
clearing
up
but
even
as
i
took
up
the
knife
again
i
paused
convulsed
with
a
wild
improbable
idea
what
if--but
there
i
held
my
breath
and
took
the
thing
before
the
fire
to
think
its
problem
out
i
sat
down
my
nerves
were
all
jangled
the
fire
needed
replenishing
it
was
low
and
i
was
cold
i
stooped
down
and
heaped
on
some
coal
then
came
a
thought
i
put
the
thing
on
a
shovel
and
held
it
over
the
grate
heat
yes
heat
the
greatest
of
great
resolvents
fool
not
to
have
thought
of
it
before
fool
indeed
one
minute--two--three
there
was
a
shadow
on
the
shovel
i
bent
forward
instantly
my
nostrils
were
assailed
with
the
unforgettable
perfume
of
the
tomb
of
ptahmes
ah
the
flood
of
recollections
that
came
surging
at
its
bidding
to
my
brain
but
i
fought
them
back
i
bent
right
over
the
fire--and
i
made
out
presently
lying
on
the
shovel
the
dim
form
of
a
tight-clenched
human
hand
chapter
xxiii
i
set
out
for
the
east
it
was
the
hand
of
a
mummy
it
had
been
half
snapped
half
torn
from
the
forearm
just
above
the
wrist
thus
the
edges
of
the
stock
were
ragged
and
the
tendons
were
drawn
out
and
torn
the
bone
however
had
fractured
clearly
just
as
glass
breaks
leaving
a
hard
smooth
edge
but
the
hand
was
not
an
ordinary
mummy's
hand
the
bones
were
covered
with
mummified
flesh
truly
but
although
dry
it
was
neither
stiff
nor
brittle
on
the
contrary
it
possessed
the
tough
consistency
of
leather
and
was
resilient
and
kneadable
like
rubber
the
phalanges
when
pulled
straight
returned
to
their
ordinary
and
original
position
like
springs
immediately
the
pressure
was
removed
the
colour
of
the
skin
was
a
very
dark
chocolate
it
was
marvellously
preserved
the
very
pores
were
still
discernible
and
the
veins
and
arteries
beneath
the
epidermis
which
had
been
converted
by
age
into
fine
black
cords
could
be
traced
with
ease
now
whose
hand
was
it
from
what
mummy
torn
and
how
had
weldon
become
possessed
of
it
i
gave
up
the
attempt
to
solve
the
first
two
problems
as
soon
as
i
had
mentally
propounded
them
the
third
however
answered
itself
i
knew
weldon
too
thoroughly
to
admit
a
doubt
that
he
would
ever
have
carried
about
with
him
such
a
ghastly
trophy
like
most
healthy
young
englishmen
he
had
a
horror
of
such
things
well
then
he
must
have
snatched
the
hand
then
invisible
from
the
grasp
of
someone--in
the
very
moment
in
which
he
had
been
falling
to
his
death
but
no
one
had
been
near
him
that
is
no
one
visible
to
us
or
him
but
since
the
hand
had
been
practically
invisible
until
i
had
subjected
it
to
the
influence
of
heat
was
it
not
just
as
likely
that
it
might
have
been--nay
must
have
been--carried
by
an
invisible
person
but
that
invisible
person
must
have
been
very
near
weldon
he
must
have
been
close
enough
to
have
saved
weldon
had
he
chosen
why
had
he
not
chosen
why
indeed
unless
he
had
wished
weldon
to
die
and
if
he
had
wished
weldon
to
die
would
it
not
have
been
easy
for
him--because
invisible--to
help
weldon
to
die
easy
good
heavens
how
easy
how
appallingly
easy
and
then
i
remembered
how
astonished
i
had
been
to
see
weldon
stagger
back
step
after
step
to
the
platform's
edge--three
steps
at
least
i
understood
it
now--and
his
startled
outcry
he
had
been
assailed
by
an
invisible
adversary
he
had
been
forced
back
he
had
been
hurled
over
the
platform--and
as
he
fell
he
had
clutched
out
wildly
and
seized
the
mummy's
hand
he
had
been
foully
murdered
and
we
had
watched
his
murder
comprehending
nothing
my
flesh
began
to
creep
as
the
light
of
understanding
broke
in
upon
my
brain
for
i
realised
in
the
same
instant
that
weldon's
murderer
was
in
all
probability
the
man
who
had
had
most
occasion
to
desire
his
death--belleville--my
enemy
and
the
enemy
although
the
lover
of
the
woman
i
loved
the
wretch
in
whose
power
she
was
at
that
moment
he
had
warned
miss
ottley
that
unless
she
broke
off
her
engagement
with
weldon
her
fiancã©
would
die
within
the
week
he
had
died--murdered
in
cold
blood--on
the
evening
of
the
seventh
day
belleville
had
been
most
terribly
faithful
to
his
awful
promise
to
the
very
letter
he
had
kept
his
dreadful
vow
and
now--miss
ottley
was
his
prisoner
in
her
own
father's
house
and
no
doubt
sir
robert
ottley
sick
enfeebled
in
body
and
intellect
was
belleville's
puppet
instrument
to
the
furtherance
of
his
atrocious
purposes
what
chance
had
i--fighting
a
man
so
utterly
unscrupulous
so
strong-willed
and
remorseless
and
endowed
with
a
power
so
tremendous
and
far-reaching
as
the
possession
of
a
chemical
agent
capable
of
rendering
himself
imperceptible
to
mortal
sight
whenever
it
should
please
him
to
make
use
of
it
how
could
i
or
anybody
bring
such
a
man
to
justice
why
even
if
i
should
foil
his
scheme
for
my
undoing
and
were
it
possible
as
well
to
get
the
better
of
him
to
the
extent
of
satisfying
myself
beyond
doubt
as
to
his
guilt
what
court
on
earth
would
believe
the
evidence
i
could
bring
forward
a
tissue
of
absurdities
a
network
of
hypotheses
and
chimeras
i
should
be
laughed
at
as
a
madman
a
foolish
visionary
and
he
would
go
scot
free
with
undamaged
reputation
free
to
work
his
evil
will
upon
an
unconscious
and
defenceless
world
belleville's
advantage
over
me
was
so
manifestly
overwhelming
that
i
confess
the
prospect
of
entering
into
a
trial
of
strength
and
cunning
with
him
daunted
me
and
yet
if
i
did
not
weldon's
death
would
surely
go
unavenged
and
miss
ottley's
fate
would
be
sealed
she
would
be
forced
into
a
marriage--somehow
or
other--with
a
man
she
loathed--the
murderer
of
her
dead
lover
i
felt
so
sure
of
this
that
towards
morning
i
resumed
my
packing
i
did
not
go
to
bed
at
all
after
breakfast
i
went
out
and
called
at
half
a
dozen
newspaper
offices
i
saw
as
many
journalists
who
all
promised
to
paragraph
my
departure
for
the
east
i
then
wrote
a
letter
to
the
society
stating
guardedly
my
intention
of
again
visiting
the
nile
and
i
caught
the
afternoon
train
to
dover
that
night
i
slept
at
calais
on
the
following
day
i
went
to
paris
and
put
myself
in
the
hands
of
a
hairdresser
and
costumier
who
carried
on
a
peculiar
business
at
montmartre
under
the
secret
surveillance
and
government
of
the
police
for
a
respectable
consideration
he
effected
a
complete
metamorphosis
in
my
appearance
he
speckled
my
black
eyebrows
with
silver
he
shaved
off
my
moustache
and
beard
and
dyed
my
skin
a
jejeune
saffron
my
hair
a
bilious
iron-brown
he
forbade
me
to
wear
a
starched
collar
he
taught
me
how
to
walk
like
an
elderly
man
and
finally
he
provided
me
with
a
suit
of
clothes
that
fitted
fairly
well
but
which
could
not
be
said
to
possess
any
other
virtue
but
the
fellow
was
well
worthy
of
his
hire
when
he
had
finished
with
me
i
could
not
recognise
myself
the
mirror
showed
me
a
gaunt
piece
of
human
wreckage
i
was
to
the
life
a
decayed
gentleman
an
unobtrusively
rakish
elderly
degenerate
i
was
remarkable
in
nothing
except
height
and
even
that
singularity
departed
as
i
learned
to
stoop
in
such
guise
i
returned
to
london
by
way
of
boulogne
and
folkestone
and
i
took
up
residence
immediately
in
a
tenement-house
in
soho
to
which
i
had
been
recommended
by
my
friend
the
costumier
it
was
a
curious
place
it
was
populated
by
frenchmen
italians
and
a
sprinkling
of
swiss
and
a
number
of
russian
political
refugees
i
found
them
a
decent
lot
of
law-abiding
miserables
the
majority
were
derelicts
of
fortune
who
lived
like
parasites
on
the
toil
of
some
few
hardworking
foolish
artisans
among
them
and
yet
despite
their
deplorable
estate
they
always
had
a
cheerful
word
and
a
smile
to
spare
for
a
stranger
they
were
a
picturesque
interesting
people
and
i
should
have
liked
to
study
them
under
other
circumstances
but
placed
as
i
was
i
conceived
it
best
to
keep
my
room
as
much
as
possible
and
i
only
went
abroad
to
buy
a
paper
and
to
eat
and
drink
on
the
fourth
morning
the
expected
summons
came
to
hand
it
was
the
first
advertisement
in
the
column
d
menchikoff
fearless
doorfront
twelve
unfailing
noiseless
open
mizpah
and
this
i
interpreted
to
mean
fearlessly
approach
the
front
door
at
midnight
this
evening
you
will
find
it
open
enter
without
noise
god
be
with
you
till
we
meet
chapter
xxiv
the
gin
is
sprung
i
set
out
wearing
rubber
shoes
and
armed
with
a
loaded
revolver
this
i
concealed
in
my
breast
pocket
i
timed
myself
so
nicely
that
i
arrived
at
sir
robert
ottley's
mansion
on
the
fifth
stroke
of
twelve
forthwith
i
mounted
the
steps
and
softly
tried
the
door
it
was
ajar
i
pushed
it
back
and
entered
closing
it
noiselessly
behind
me
i
locked
it
too
the
hall
was
unlighted
and
black
as
erebus
i
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
listening
breathlessly
then
i
thought
i
heard
a
sigh
may
i
whispered
i
was
answered
by
a
sibilant
soft
s-sh
then
a
hand
was
laid
upon
my
sleeve
and
i
felt
myself
drawn
forward
i
gave
myself
up
to
be
guided
the
more
willingly
that
i
hardly
knew
the
place
we
came
to
a
staircase
my
guide
breathed
s-sh
again
and
muttered
stairs
we
climbed
them
step
by
step
heavens
how
dark
it
was
afterwards
i
was
drawn
like
a
shadow
through
a
maze
of
thickly
carpeted
corridors
finally
we
stopped
the
hand
left
my
arm
and
i
heard
a
door
creak
open
come
whispered
my
guide
i
stepped
towards
a
dim
dim
glow
and
as
i
crossed
the
threshold
the
door
shutting
on
my
entrance
grazed
my
arm
at
last
the
voice
whispered
it
was
a
signal
hardly
was
it
uttered
than
a
blaze
of
white
light
stabbed
the
darkness
i
found
myself
in
an
immense
apartment
blinking
foolishly
into
the
muzzle
of
a
revolver
presented
at
my
forehead
by
dr
belleville
our
eyes
met
presently
across
the
sights
his
were
smiling
coldly
an
excellent
disguise
dr
pinsent
my
sincere
congratulations
he
observed
it
is
evident
you
have
obeyed
my
instructions
to
the
letter
your
instructions
i
said
ay
mine
then
you----
the
cipher
was
my
idea
entirely
ah
but
you
must
not
blame
miss
ottley
she
signed
the
first
letter
without
understanding
later
however
she
would
not
write
she
knew
i
was
obliged
to
use
the
typewriter
and
in
order
to
convince
you
of
the
authenticity
of
the
letter
i
threw
at
your
feet
last
thursday
night--my
emissary
followed
you
home
and
pretended
to
wish
to
wrest
it
from
you
you
fell
into
the
snare
and
now
you
are
here
and
no
one
knows
eh
no
one
knows
you
think
so
i
asked
i
was
beginning
to
get
back
my
wits
but
he
only
laughed
it
does
not
matter
the
great
thing
is
you
are
here
and
in
my
power
that
was
all
i
wanted
now
ottley
now
it
was
another
signal
something
hard
and
heavy
crashed
against
my
skull
for
a
second
i
fought
for
breath
against
a
horrible
feeling
of
sickness
and
impotence
then
came
blank
night
and
nothingness
i
had
been
sandbagged
i
recovered
to
find
that
my
captors
had
strapped
me
hand
and
foot
in
a
huge
iron
chair
i
could
not
move
an
inch
in
any
one
direction
but
otherwise
my
situation
was
tolerably
comfortable
belleville
sat
facing
me
some
feet
away
he
was
plucking
thoughtfully
at
his
big
black
beard
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
perceiving
i
was
awake
he
arose
and
took
from
a
table
near
him
a
glass
of
water
which
he
brought
to
me
it
is
not
poisoned
he
remarked
i
have
considerable
need
of
you
for
some
time
yet
he
placed
the
glass
to
my
lips
then
and
i
drank
with
confidence
i
felt
better
afterwards
but
my
head
ached
bravely
still
belleville
resumed
his
chair
and
again
began
to
pluck
at
his
beard
no
doubt
your
head
aches
he
observed
i
regret
having
been
obliged
to
use
you
so
discourteously
but
we
have
had
so
much
experience
of
your
muscular
vigour
that
to
have
risked
a
physical
encounter
would
have
been
absurd
we
might
have
been
forced
to
kill
you
and
that
would
not
have
suited
my
plans
indeed
said
i
it
cost
me
a
painful
effort
to
speak
at
all
i
desire
to
be
perfectly
candid
with
you
said
belleville
but
before
we
get
down
to
business
it
were
as
well
to
prove
to
you
how
completely
at
my
mercy
you
are
he
took
as
he
spoke
a
revolver
from
his
pocket
and
aimed
carelessly
at
the
opposite
wall
this
apartment
used
to
be
a
shooting
gallery
he
observed
all
the
walls
are
padded
he
then
discharged
the
weapon
six
times
in
rapid
succession
the
bullets
spattered
on
a
plate
of
steel
the
sound
of
the
reports
was
simply
deafening
a
full
minute
passed
before
the
echoes
and
reverberations
ceased
all
the
while
belleville
smiled
at
me
no
one
heard
but
you
and
i
he
said
the
futility
therefore
of
wasting
your
breath
in
shouting
for
help
will
appeal
to
you
i
glanced
about
and
found
that
all
the
walls
i
could
see
were
windowless
the
room
was
lighted
by
electricity
the
door
was
thickly
coated
with
padded
cushioned
leather
the
floor
was
carpeted
with
one
vast
sheet
of
rubber
the
place
was
fitted
up
as
a
chemical
laboratory
i
counted
half
a
dozen
glass
tables
littered
with
retorts
and
dynamos
testing
tubes
and
other
instruments
there
were
big
glass
cases
filled
with
porcelain
boxes
and
phials
of
drugs
and
large
jars
containing
acids
and
finally
there
was
one
object
my
eyes
rested
on
with
a
little
shock
of
recognition
this
was
the
sarcophagus
of
ptahmes
it
was
raised
about
three
feet
from
the
ground
upon
two
steel
trestles
the
great
sculptured
lid
was
propped
on
end
against
a
neighbouring
wall
but
although
the
coffin
was
open
i
could
not
see
within
it
because
the
edge
was
almost
on
a
level
with
my
eyes
are
you
satisfied
asked
belleville
presently
he
had
followed
the
direction
of
my
glances
with
a
sort
of
half-contemptuous
half-amused
curiosity
reloading
his
revolver
the
while
the
man
evidently
cherished
an
immense
opinion
of
himself--but
he
was
as
cautious
as
a
sage
witness
the
reloading
of
his
weapon--despite
the
fact
that
i
was
as
helpless
as
a
trussed
fowl
yes
i
am
satisfied
i
answered
and
cool
what
i
mean
is
are
you
perfectly
collected
do
you
feel
able
to
engage
in
conversation
or
are
you
too
dazed--or
perhaps
too
angry
i
can
promise
at
least
to
listen
and
try
to
understand
you
he
gave
me
a
sardonic
smile
the
under
dog
is
a
fool
to
be
sarcastic
he
said
drily
however
please
yourself
listen
then
you
are
no
doubt
aware
that
it
is
one
of
my
ambitions
to
marry
miss
ottley
yes
captain
weldon
stood
some
time
since
in
my
road
yes
peace
to
his
ashes
smiled
the
doctor
then
he
frowned
but
to
my
astonishment
i
now
find
that
the
lady
did
not
care
for
the
gallant
captain
indeed
indeed
and
indeed
belleville
bit
his
lip
but
for
you
he
snarled
i
was
silent
it
is
almost
incredible
but
it
is
true
she
has
confided
in
you
i
asked
as
a
preliminary
step
to
defying
me
replied
belleville
it
was
rather
silly
of
her
but
perhaps
she
could
not
help
herself
women
even
the
wisest
are
slaves
to
their
emotions
of
the
moment
i
was
willing
to
make
all
sorts
of
concessions
too
i
even
offered
her
your
life
my
life
i
offered
to
permit
you
to
live
if
she
would
marry
me
and
she
belleville
bared
his
teeth
just
as
i
have
seen
a
jackal
grin
you
know
how
women
love
to
glorify
the
objects
of
their
admiration
he
said
slowly
in
their
opinion
the
men
they--they
love--are
always
the
wisest
the
strongest
the
most
astute
and
the
best
i
am
free
to
admit
my
dear
pinsent
that
you
are
by
no
means
a
fool
you
have
no
doubt
a
fairly
keen
intelligence--but
miss
ottley
has
placed
you
on
an
alabaster
pedestal--pedestal
do
i
say
a
pinnacle
she
has
actually
ventured
to
contrast
your
ability
with
mine
to
my
disparagement
she
rejected
my
offer
with
disdain
and
challenged
me
to
measure
wits
with
you
and
when
i
accepted
the
challenge
she
calmly
predicted
that
you
would
defeat
and
destroy
me
it
thus
became
my
duty
to
show
her
how
mistaken
and
fallible
in
truth
is
her
estimate
of
me
weldon's
death
taught
her
nothing
absolutely
nothing
she
protested
that
if
i
was
really
the
deus
ex
machina
it
only
proved
me
to
be
an
ordinary
sort
of
heartless
murderer
weldon's
particular
order
of
intellect
never
impressed
her
it
appears
but
yours
in
her
eyes
is
little
short
of
divine
there
was
no
help
then
but
to
dispose
of
you
in
such
a
way
as
to
open
her
eyes
it
is
no
boast
to
say
that
i
could
have
killed
you
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night
i
pleased
for
weeks
past
had
i
done
so
however
i
should
have
been
constrained
so
to
arrange
matters--as
in
weldon's
case--as
to
make
your
end
appear
natural
and
i'm
afraid
miss
ottley
would
on
that
account
have
been
inclined
to
consider
for
a
second
time
me
a
lucky
prophet
and
you
the
second
victim
of
an
inscrutable
providence
that
is
her
present
attitude
toward
weldon's
final
exit
from
the
stage
of
life
i
was
obliged
then
so
to
arrange
matters
as
to
get
you
into
my
power
but
bien
entendu
without
the
fanfare
of
trumpets
i
flatter
myself
that
i
have
managed
very
well
you
may
pretend
the
contrary
if
you
choose
but
you'll
not
convince
me
i
have
had
your
every
movement
carefully
followed
and
i
believe
that
outside
of
this
house
there
is
not
a
soul
in
england
of
your
acquaintance
who
has
a
doubt
but
that
you
are
on
your
way
to
egypt
and
i
have
neglected
no
precautions
that
could
ever
give
rise
to
such
a
doubt
immediately
you
quitted
your
lodgings
in
soho
this
evening
my
emissary
entered
your
room
by
means
of
a
master
key
and
brought
away
your
trunks
no
one
saw
him
for
he
was
invisible
and
no
one
saw
your
trunks
depart
for
he
made
them
invisible
too
they
are
at
this
moment
in
this
house
you
doubt
me
yes
i
cried
i
doubt
you
produce
them
i
am
too
comfortable
to
move
smiled
belleville
but
here
is
something
i
found
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
them
as
he
spoke
he
took
from
his
breast
pocket
the
mummy
hand
poor
weldon
had
given
me
i
could
not
suppress
an
exclamation
he
had
spoken
truly
then
belleville
tossed
the
hand
upon
a
table
i
was
rather
glad
to
get
it
back
he
said
not
that
it
really
mattered
but
i
wondered
who
had
found
it
did
weldon
still
cling
to
it
after
he
was
dead
you
scoundrel
i
cried
it
was
you--really
then
you
pushed
him
over
the
platform
he
laughed
in
person
no
but
by
direction
yes
then
he
became
serious
but
let
us
avoid
personalities
if
you
please
we
each
possess
an
ugly
temper
i
believe
and
mine
is
sometimes
uncontrollable
do
you
agree
proceed
said
i
he
bowed
ironically
there
is
but
little
more
to
tell
you
now
you
know
almost
all
you
need
to
know
and
enough
i
feel
sure
to
enable
you
to
anticipate
your
fate
you
intend
to
murder
me
i
suppose
exactly
but
it
depends
on
yourself
whether
you
shall
have
a
painless
death
or
no
if
you
will
do
what
i
require
you
shall
have
the
choice
between
aconite
and
morphia
if
you
refuse
well--he
pursed
up
his
lips--you'll
live
longer
pinsent
yes
you'll
live
longer--but
frankly
old
chap
you
won't
like
it
i
hate
you
you
know
and
i
am
a
surgeon
and
you
are
there
and
i
am
here
i
repeat
i
hate
you
and
i
am
not
only
a
surgeon
i
am
a
skilful
surgeon
i
am
besides
a
vivisectionist
that
is
one
of
my
hobbies
and
i'll
keep
you
alive
as
long
as
possible
for
let
me
yet
again
assure
you
i
hate--you--hate
you
hate
you
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
he
hated
me
the
emotion
was
infectious
i
hated
him
i
had
before
but
i
now
realised
how
much
after
one
long
glance
into
his
gloating
eyes
i
lowered
mine
and
asked
in
a
voice
i
strove
to
render
civil
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
for
you
i
want
you
to
play
the
part
of
a
friendly
disembodied
ghostly
match-maker
i
fail
to
understand
you
naturally
but
listen
i
intend
to
render
you
invisible
when
that
is
done
i
shall
bring
miss
ottley
here
she
knows
your
voice
you
will
speak
to
her
do
you
see
daylight
now
i
begin
that
is
well
you
will
inform
the
lady
that
you
are
dead
but
that
your
spirit
is
held
in
durance
vile
at
my
command
like
all
other
women
she
is
at
heart
deeply
superstitious
she
will
believe
what
you
say
and
she
will
conceive
a
prodigious
respect
for
my
power
and
ability
you
will
assure
her
that
i
control
your
fate
and
that
you
can
only
obtain
deliverance
from
unimaginably
awful
tortures
at
the
price
of
her
consenting
to
become
immediately
my
wife
well
a
pretty
plot
said
i
i
felt
certain
it
would
earn
your
admiration
he
returned
i
marvel
at
your
candour
my
dear
pinsent
he
said
smiling
complete
candour
is
the
privilege
of
the
all-powerful
and
that
am
i--at
least
in
your
regard
i
can
perfectly
afford
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
because
i
can
compel
you
to
serve
me
even
should
you
decide
to
disobey
me
indeed
and
how
the
thing
is
as
simple
as
a
b
c
if
you
are
so
foolish
as
to
refuse
to
play
the
part
i
have
assigned
i
shall
render
you
three
parts--instead
of
entirely
invisible
i
shall
make
your
bonds
however
entirely
invisible
you
will
then
be
put
to
certain
electrical
tortures
of
my
invention
and
i
shall
invite
miss
ottley
to
observe
the
spectacle
of
a
soul
in
pain
i
confess
i
should
prefer
you
to
behave
like
a
sensible
ghost
and
talk
to
her
in
the
manner
i
have
indicated
but
you
must
admit
that
in
the
alternative
she
will
nevertheless
be
forced
to
a
conclusion
flattering
alike
to
my
ambition
and
my
pride
is
it
possible
that
you
are
all
the
heartless
scoundrel
you
pretend
can
you
really
find
pleasure
in
the
notion
of
winning
the
woman
you
are
presumed
to
love--by
a
trick
so
infamous
and
despicable
yes
pinsent
yes
you
must
be
animated
by
a
devil
on
the
contrary
my
dear
enemy
i
am
just
an
ordinary
human
being
who
has
been
seduced
by
the
most
extraordinary
temptation
that
has
ever
been
offered
to
a
living
being
a
power
has
been
placed
at
my
disposal
which
puts
me
on
a
level
with
the
immortal
gods
of
ancient
greece
in
deciding
to
make
use
of
it
i
have
adopted
their
ideas
of
morality
almost
as
it
were
perforce
i
now
make
a
cult
of
my
convenience
and
a
religion
of
the
indulgence
of
my
instincts
i
intend
henceforth
to
kill
always
what
i
hate
to
possess
what
i
love
to
seize
what
i
covet
and
to
enjoy
what
i
desire
miss
ottley
dislikes
and
despises
me
that
has
irritated
my
vanity
to
such
an
extent
that
it
is
necessary
to
my
happiness
that
i
should
convert
her
dislike
into
subjection
her
contempt
into
the
unbounded
reverence
of
fear
when
she
becomes
my
wife
i
shall
be
the
master
of
her
millions--her
father
is
on
the
point
of
dissolution--and
i
shall
be
the
tyrant
of
her
person
i
shall
rule
her
with
a
rod
of
iron
terror
that
domination
will
give
me
a
far
greater
joy
than
the
vulgar
pleasure
of
reciprocated
passion
and
not
the
least
part
of
it
will
dwell
in
the
reflection
that
you
my
dear
enemy
will
have
so
largely
and
so
unwillingly
contributed
to
the
gratification
of
my
sweet
will
now
you
have
all
the
facts
before
you
my
cards
are
all
exposed
it
is
for
you
to
make
up
your
mind
what
you
will
do
don't
decide
immediately
there
is
no
hurry
think
the
matter
over
as
i
am
rather
weary
he
yawned
in
my
face
i
shall
now
leave
you
to
your
meditations
till
the
morning
good-night
he
rose
bowed
to
me
with
mock
politeness
and
moved
over
to
the
door
a
moment
later
he
had
gone
and
with
him
the
light
vanished
i
was
left
in
the
profoundest
darkness
and
my
thoughts
were
nearly
as
colourless
and
sombre
as
the
gloom
in
which
i
sat
chapter
xxv
the
mummy
talks
the
sensation
of
awakening
informed
me
of
the
surprising
fact
that
i
had
fallen
asleep
i
was
rather
proud
under
the
circumstances
that
i
had
been
able
to
do
so
probably
i
had
slept
for
a
long
while
too
for
the
laboratory
was
lighted
up
and
it
was
evident
that
it
had
been
carefully
dusted
in
the
interval
there
was
a
sound
of
sweeping
behind
my
chair
but
strain
as
i
would
i
could
not
turn
my
head
to
see
who
was
my
companion
i
say
i
called
out
i
am
thirsty
fetch
me
a
glass
of
water
will
you
the
sweeping
stopped
presently
steps
approached
my
chair
they
passed
it
and
next
second
i
saw
the
giant
arab
of
the
cave
temple
at
rakh
the
wretch
who
had
attempted
to
strangle
me
at
my
camp
and
whom
i
had
released
from
the
sarcophagus
of
ptahmes
on
the
nile
he
stood
before
me
his
extraordinary
blood-coloured
eyes
staring
at
me
with
the
glazed
expressionless
regard
of
an
automaton
he
was
clad
in
a
long
yellow
shapeless
garment
like
a
smock
and
his
feet
were
shod
in
leather
sandals
in
one
hand
he
held
a
broom
very
slowly
he
extended
his
other
arm
before
my
face
and
i
saw
with
a
shock
of
aversion
that
the
hand
had
gone
it
had
been
severed
from
the
wrist
and
nothing
but
a
stump
remained
involuntarily
i
thought
of
the
mummy
hand
which
poor
weldon
had
given
me
it
still
lay
upon
the
table
where
dr
belleville
had
tossed
it
full
in
my
view
it
was
a
left
hand
the
arab's
left
hand
had
been
lost
the
connection
was
obvious
but--but--of
course
a
mummy
hand
thousands
of
years
old
perhaps
could
not
have
grown
upon
a
still
living
breathing
man
living
breathing
the
words
repeated
themselves
as
i
gazed
at
the
arab
how
like
a
mummy
he
appeared
his
skin
was
of
exactly
the
same
colour
as
the
mummy
hand
it
had
the
same
shrivelled
appearance
the
same
leather-like
texture
and
good
heavens
unless
i
dreamed
he
did
not
breathe
not
a
movement
of
his
body
disclosed
the
smallest
sign
of
respiration
i
stared
at
him
appalled
his
features
were
fixed
and
set
rigidly
his
mouth
was
closed
his
nostrils
were
fallen
in
and
glued
together
how
then
could
he
breathe
and
yet
there
was
life
in
his
gaunt
frame
some
animating
spirit
that
controlled
its
mechanism
for
slowly
his
handless
arm
fell
back
to
his
side
and
he
continued
to
regard
me
with
a
steadfast
unwinking
stare
i
examined
his
eyes
and
found
that
they
were
lidless
the
lids
had
shrunken
back
and
disappeared
a
closer
inspection
showed
that
the
eyes
themselves
owed
all
their
lustre
to
reflected
light
the
cornea
was
in
each
orb
nothing
but
a
thin
gelatinous-like
film
filled
with
tiny
little
crinkles
that
caught
up
and
refracted
passing
rays
from
all
directions
the
whites
were
opaque
black
teguments
dry
and
dead
behind
the
lenses
was
no
sign
of
any
pupil
there
was
nothing
but
an
iris
which
seemed
to
be
composed
of
dull
red
dust
living
breathing
the
arab
was
a
mummy
an
animated
corpse
oh
of
course
i
dreamed
i
must
have
dreamed
i
have
told
myself
that
so
many
thousand
times
that
it
is
a
marvel
the
constant
reiteration
has
not
forced
me
to
believe
it
but
i
do
not
nor
do
i
know
what
to
believe
i
am
in
as
great
a
maze
to
understand
now
as
i
was
then
at
first
i
conceived
an
almost
intolerable
horror
of
the
thing
before
me
but
finding
that
the
arab
did
not
menace
me
i
gradually
became
accustomed
to
its
most
unpleasant
and
almost
ghastly
proximity
and
after
a
time
i
felt
so
strong
a
fever
of
thirst
that
i
forced
myself
to
speak
to
it
again
i
asked
it
for
water
it
did
not
move
i
became
convinced
it
heard
but
did
not
comprehend
the
language
i
employed
i
spoke
to
it
in
french
and
german
and
in
arabic
but
still
it
did
not
move
finally
i
said
to
myself
if
it
is
a
mummy
it
will
be
an
egyptian
and
will
understand
the
tongue
of
ancient
egypt
then
i
gasped
out
such
a
term
as
i
believed
might
have
been
used
by
a
thirsty
theban
asking
for
alleviation
of
his
famine
the
thing
instantly
moved
off
behind
me
presently
i
heard
the
sound
of
falling
water
and
a
moment
later
a
glass
was
pressed
to
my
parched
lips
i
drained
it
thankfully
eyeing
the
while
with
a
feeling
of
deep
unconquerable
repulsion
the
sinewy
black
mummy
hand
that
served
me
i
then
thanked
the
arab
in
the
same
tongue
which
had
persuaded
him
to
be
my
minister
he
gazed
at
me
a
while
and
then
moved
to
the
table
and
looked
at
it
he
appeared
to
be
writing
but
i
could
not
be
sure
i
heard
a
curious
raucous
scratching
sound
thus
ten
minutes
sped
by
meanwhile
i
shut
my
eyes
and
tried
hard
to
persuade
myself
that
i
dreamed
then
a
sound
disturbed
me
i
opened
my
eyes
with
a
start
and
saw
that
the
arab
had
returned
to
my
side
he
held
a
slate
before
me
covered
with
hieroglyphics
never
had
i
greater
occasion
to
bless
my
knowledge
of
that
ancient
language
and
to
gratefully
regard
the
patient
years
of
labour
i
had
spent
acquiring
it
but
likewise
never
had
i
greater
occasion
to
lament
the
imperfections
of
my
knowledge
and
defects
in
my
memory
i
could
understand
a
portion
of
the
message--the
greater
part
indeed--but
still
a
part
escaped
me
briefly
translated
the
part
i
comprehended
ran
it
is
not
meet
that
ptahmes--named
tahutimes--son
of
mery
son
of
hap
high
priest
of
amen-ra
and
the
hawk-headed
horus
should
be
a
wicked
unbeliever's
slave
death
explains
the
spirit
of
a
good
man
hurried
hence
accuses
me
unanswered
at
the

throne
for
time
unending
fanet
king
of
all
the
gods
thus
only
shall
you
escape
the
death
that
threatens
you
shall
swear
to
break
my
stele
of
ivory
to
commit
my
papyri
to
the
flames
unread
to
burn
my
body
and
scatter
my
ashes
to
the
winds
of
heaven
you
shall
swear
by
amen-ra
king
of
earth
and
heaven
to
destroy

the
oppressor
and
your
enemy
he
has
deciphered
the
inscriptions
he
has
mastered
their
meaning
he
knows
he
cannot
be
permitted
to
live
lest
i

and
he
the
enemy
exalt
himself
and
triumph
over
you
and
me
swear
then
and
aid
shall
be
accorded
in
your
hour
of
need
i
gathered
from
this
message
that
the
ghost
of
ptahmes
inhabitated
the
mummy
before
me
that
belleville
had
possessed
himself
of
some
stupendous
wizard
power
which
enabled
him
to
compel
the
soul
and
dust
of
ptahmes
to
obey
his
infamous
behests
but
that
ptahmes
was
his
most
unwilling
slave
i
also
gathered
that
ptahmes
promised
me
help
if
i
would
take
an
oath
to
kill
belleville
to
destroy
certain
papyri
and
an
ivory
stele
in
belleville's
possession
which
i
must
promise
not
to
attempt
to
read
and
also
to
burn
the
mummified
remains
of
ptahmes
and
so
i
suppose
secure
the
rest
of
his
troubled
spirit
i
did
not
pause
to
reflect
on
the
wild
unreality
of
the
happenings
my
senses
registered
they
did
not
appear
indeed
unreal
to
me
at
all--then
on
the
contrary
i
felt
that
i
was
confronted
with
a
very
grave
and
serious
proposal
which
if
i
decided
to
accept
would
be
carried
out
to
the
letter
as
regards
the
assistance
promised
me
a
circumstance
that
would
oblige
me
as
an
honest
man
to
keep
my
part
of
the
contract
the
question
remained
would
i
be
justified
in
solemnly
swearing
to
compass
belleville's
death
why
not
surely
he
deserved
capital
punishment
if
ever
a
man
did
by
his
own
confession
he
had
either
murdered
frankfort
weldon
or
procured
his
murder
and
he
had
cold-bloodedly
assured
me
that
he
was
relentlessly
resolved
to
murder
me
and
there
were
other
things
to
think
of
he
had
given
me
positive
proof
of
the
possession
of
some
unknown
power
over
the
laws
of
nature
which
had
enabled
him
already
to
commit
crimes
without
incurring
a
shadow
of
legal
suspicion
were
i
then
to
effect
my
escape
from
him
it
would
be
my
duty
as
a
citizen
of
the
state
to
do
all
in
my
power
to
prevent
him
working
further
ill
in
the
community
yet
i
could
not
bring
him
to
justice
i
had
no
evidence
to
produce
against
him
which
the
courts
would
not
scorn
and
ridicule
the
attempt
to
convict
him
of
the
murder
he
had
confessed
to
me
would
only
result
in
branding
me
in
all
men's
eyes
as
a
lunatic
he
would
meanwhile
be
at
liberty
to
go
abroad
to
work
his
evil
will
upon
the
world
he
would
very
soon
revenge
himself
upon
me
and
destroy
me
in
the
same
diabolically
ingenious
fashion
perhaps
in
which
he
had
killed
poor
weldon
and
miss
ottley
would
then
be
at
his
mercy
with
no
man
living
to
defend
her
she
might
continue
to
resist
him
for
a
time
but
in
the
end
a
man
so
unscrupulous
and
implacably
determined
would
be
sure
to
have
his
way
able
to
make
himself
invisible--as
i
believed
he
could--he
might
as
a
last
resort
rob
her
of
her
honour
and
so
bend
her
proud
spirit
to
his
wish
it
was
this
thought
that
finally
determined
me
i
looked
up
and
said
quietly
to
the
patient
waiting
arab
ptahmes
son
of
mery
son
of
hap
once
high
priest
of
amen-ra
but
now
i
know
not
what--i
swear
by
the
king
of
earth
and
heaven
to
destroy
the
stele
and
papyri
unread
if
i
shall
find
them
to
burn
your
body
and
scatter
the
ashes
and
to
kill
your
enemy
and
mine
the
dark
fixed
corpse-like
face
of
the
arab
turned
forthwith
from
me
he
pressed
the
slate
to
his
bosom
with
the
stump
of
his
left
wrist
and
with
the
right
hand
rubbed
out
the
hieroglyphic
writing
he
then
glided
over
to
the
table
and
replaced
the
slate
i
followed
his
movements
with
the
most
passionate
attention
expecting
him
to
return
and
immediately
release
me
from
my
bonds
but
he
did
no
such
thing
in
the
contrary
he
moved
slowly
forward
to
the
great
sarcophagus
and
to
my
great
astonishment
i
saw
him
climb
over
the
edge
and
repose
himself
within
the
tomb
presently
he
had
entirely
vanished
from
my
sight
i
could
hardly
credit
my
eyes
what
was
the
meaning
of
his
strange
act
i
waited
for
a
few
minutes
but
he
did
not
reappear
then
i
called
out
his
name
aloud
ptahmes
ptahmes
nothing
answered
me
i
racked
my
brains
to
string
together
an
imploring
sentence
in
the
ancient
tongue
of
egypt
and
having
fashioned
one
i
cried
it
forth
in
tones
of
passionate
entreaty
by
turns
commanding
and
beseeching
him
to
keep
his
pledge
and
not
once
or
twice
but
a
hundred
times
did
i
address
him
in
these
ways
but
i
might
as
well
have
cried
out
to
the
stars
my
efforts
were
all
unavailing
and
at
length
wearied
out
with
them
i
desisted
and
abandoned
my
remaining
energy
to
the
bitter
task
of
reactionary
self-reviling
i
caustically
informed
myself
that
my
brain
had
gone
wandering
thus
until
i
was
hot
all
over
with
shame
then
in
a
more
kindly
spirit
i
cast
about
for
excuses
to
salve
my
intellectual
vanity
i
ascribed
the
whole
wild
dream
that
i
had
dreamed
to
the
blow
my
poor
head
had
received
last
night
but
all
the
while
deep
at
heart
i
did
not
believe
i
had
dreamed
i
pretended
to
in
order
to
make
sure
that
i
still
possessed
a
critical
scientific
faculty
but
i
did
not
believe
it
really
i
could
not
and
this
fact
is
one
more
proof
to
me
that
faith
in
all
its
forms
depends
more
upon
feeling
than
intellectual
conviction
chapter
xxvi
a
pleasant
chat
with
a
murderer
i
awoke
so
much
refreshed
and
free
from
pain
that
i
must
have
slept
for
many
hours
belleville
was
pinching
my
shoulder
his
black-visaged
face
was
curiously
bilious-looking
and
puffy
purple
hollows
underhung
his
eyes
you
didn't
sleep
thus
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
he
muttered
with
a
sick
man's
frown
you
were
wakeful
enough
then
one
would
think
you
had
been
drugged
indeed
said
i
but
i
had
need
to
be
wakeful
then
who
set
on
the
light
he
demanded
i
swear
i
left
you
in
dark
who
has
been
here
your
arab
i
replied
he
swept
out
the
room
and
gave
me
a
drink
then
he
climbed
into
the
sarcophagus
yonder
and
unless
he
went
away
while
i
slept
there
you'll
find
him
the
rascal
looked
perfectly
astounded
my
arab
he
repeated
staring
sharply
into
my
eyes
then
of
a
sudden
he
turned
and
simply
rushed
over
to
the
big
lead
coffin
stooping
over
the
edge
he
peeped
into
the
interior
and
seemed
to
be
shifting
something
with
his
hands
his
back
was
all
i
saw
but
it
moved
to
and
fro
and
he
strained
on
tiptoe
when
he
stood
up
his
face
was
scarlet
and
his
eyes
were
troubled
swept
the
room
you
said
and
gave
you
a
drink
he
muttered
half
to
himself
with
that
he
took
to
examining
the
floor
crawling
on
hands
and
knees
his
peregrinations
took
him
behind
me
and
what
he
did
there
or
found
there
i
do
not
know
but
he
rapped
out
an
oath
and
i
heard
him
pacing
up
and
down
swearing
in
an
angry
undertone
so
five
minutes
passed
then
he
stalked
into
my
view
and
showed
me
a
very
troubled
and
a
very
angry
countenance
you
asked
my
arab
for
a
drink
he
cried
i
did
said
i
in
english
what
else
did
he
answer
you
in
the
kindliest
fashion
possible
he
assuaged
my
thirst
blast
him
cried
belleville
all
of
a
tremble
with
rage
the
villain
has
been
tricking
me
like
enough
i've
loosed
a
force
i'll
yet
have
to
reckon
with
i
don't
comprehend
said
i
nor
need
you
he
rapped
back
shut
your
mouth
till
i
address
you
or
i'll
cut
your
prying
tongue
out
the
rascal
was
beside
himself
that
was
evident
and
since
i
was
quite
at
his
mercy
i
thought
it
best
to
do
his
bidding
he
clapped
a
hand
to
his
head
and
rushed
once
more
to
the
sarcophagus
he
glared
over
the
edge
for
a
minute
then
turned
and
flung
out
his
arms
for
two
pins
i'd
do
it
now
he
gasped
cut
him
to
pieces
and
burn
the
parts
it's
doubtful
if
i'll
ever
get
more
good
out
of
him
but
if
i
do
that
i'll
kill
the
chance
and
yet
he's
played
me
false
already
been
laughing
in
his
sleeve
at
me
but
no--he
can't
have
meant
hurt
or
he'd
have
freed
the
prisoner
as
easy
that
as
fetch
him
a
drink
no
doubt
he
was
asked
yet
he's
not
to
be
trusted
now
that
is
evident
i'll
have
to
gaol
him
too
let's
see
he
crossed
the
room
and
caught
hold
of
the
lid
of
the
sarcophagus
but
do
what
he
could
he
was
unable
to
shift
it
i
regarded
his
efforts
with
a
deal
of
secret
amusement
he
emerged
from
the
struggle
panting
and
with
disordered
dress
and
his
temper
in
a
molten
glow
but
he
was
not
beaten
leaving
the
lid
alone
he
wheeled
a
big
lounge
over
to
the
sarcophagus
and
tipping
it
on
edge
heaved
it
up
athwart
the
mouth
then
he
piled
everything
of
weight
he
could
find
atop
of
the
lounge
and
soon
he
had
built
up
a
pyramid
which
would
have
taken
a
hercules
to
shift
if
shut
up
in
the
sarcophagus
beneath
it
was
then
that
i
began
to
feel
i
had
been
a
notable
fool
in
telling
belleville
anything
about
the
arab
but
it
was
little
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
his
labours
over
the
rascal
sank
into
a
chair
before
me
and
began
fanning
his
hot
face
with
a
piece
of
cardboard
now
for
our
business
he
presently
observed
you've
probably
come
to
some
decision
pinsent
i
wait
to
hear
it
well
i
said
the
thing
is
in
a
nutshell
you've
promised
me
nothing
but
a
choice
of
deaths
i
may
be
a
fool
but
i
like
life
so
well
that
i
prefer
a
lingering
sort
to
any
other
however
painless
you're
a
fool
he
answered
shortly
and
pouted
out
his
loose
thick
lips
beyond
his
beard
so
that
he
seemed
to
have
the
snout
of
a
hairy
pig
you
don't
know
what
a
pleasure
it
will
be
to
me
to
torture
you
he
continued
i'll
make
you
suffer
like
the
damned
before
you
die
i
don't
doubt
your
will
it's
your
ability
which
is
in
question
i
said
as
coolly
as
i
was
able
you
may
think
you
have
me
laid
here
very
nicely
by
the
heels
dr
belleville
and
so
you
have
in
seeming
but
you're
not
the
only
man
who
has
a
knowledge
of
the
old
magic
arts
of
ancient
egypt
i
tell
you
to
your
face
that
i
possess
a
charm
no
whit
less
potent
than
the
one
you
found
the
secret
of
in
yonder
tomb
and
if
you
force
me
to
use
it
why
i
shall
use
it
now
put
that
in
your
pipe
and
smoke
it
he
stood
up
at
once
greatly
surprised
much
incredulous
but
also
a
little
troubled
and
dubious
as
i
could
see
you
think
you
can
bluff
me
he
snarled
but
i
had
bluffed
him
i
could
read
it
in
his
eyes
i
answered
him
with
nothing
but
a
smile
he
assumed
a
sneer
his
eyes
glinted
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
revolver
he
cocked
the
weapon
and
put
it
to
my
temple
well
you've
challenged
me
he
jeered
in
just
one
minute
i'll
blow
your
brains
out
your
charm
is
now
in
question
for
a
few
seconds
a
dark
haze
of
blind
terror
shut
off
my
power
of
vision
i
felt
the
villain
meant
to
do
what
he
had
threatened
his
nerves
had
been
shaken
by
what
i
had
said
to
him
about
the
arab--though
why
i
could
not
fathom--and
my
challenge
although
the
merest
bluff
had
completed
their
disorder
he
was
in
a
spell
of
panic
and
it
had
swept
his
reason
and
his
resolution
to
the
winds
he
intended
to
kill
me
in
order
to
restore
his
own
sense
of
security
and
at
once
and
i
was
impotent
to
prevent
him
he
was
counting
aloud
one
two
three
four
he
had
got
up
to
fifteen
before
i
even
partially
awoke
out
of
my
trance
of
craven
fear
but
in
the
next
five
seconds
i
had
lived
a
whole
series
of
lifetimes
and
i
had
received
an
inspiration
born
of
wrath
and
hate
and
desperate
necessity
look
in
my
eyes
i
shrieked
at
him
and
listen
if
you
want
to
live
he
looked
at
me
i
put
the
strength
of
my
existence
into
my
gaze
and
i
felt
a
strange
wild
thrill
of
exultation
as
i
saw
his
eyes
dilate
encountering
the
glance
i
threw
at
him
my
death
means
yours
i
hissed
my
monitor
stands
over
you
you'll
be
shrivelled
as
by
lightning
we'll
go
together
to
the
throne
of
god
now
shoot
if
you
will
and
damn
your
soul
for
all
eternity
shoot--shoot
but
dr
belleville
did
not
shoot
his
hand
fell
to
his
side
he
staggered
back
staring
at
me
open-mouthed
until
the
chair
arrested
him
i
saw
my
advantage
and
pressed
it
home
stop
i
shouted
as
you
value
your
dirty
life
stop
stand
still
and
do
not
turn
your
head
one
movement
and
we
both
die
i
don't
want
to
die
for
a
dog
like
you
he
stood
like
a
frozen
image
holding
his
glance
with
mine
i
began
to
mutter
in
a
sing-song
way
a
string
of
meaningless
egyptian
phrases
then
the
more
powerfully
to
impress
the
superstitious
fool-scoundrel
all
of
a
sudden
i
uttered
a
loud
heart-rending
groan
and
allowed
my
head
to
fall
over
on
the
strap
that
encircled
and
sustained
my
neck
but
though
i
only
affected
to
swoon
the
frightful
amount
of
will
force
and
nervous
energy
i
had
expended
in
the
crisis
had
induced
a
consequential
lassitude
so
enthralling
that
i
came
very
near
to
fainting
in
reality
and
indeed
it
is
quite
likely
that
i
lost
my
senses
for
a
time
soon
however
i
felt
water
sprinkled
on
my
face
and
slowly
i
raised
my
head
a
drink
i
gasped
a
glass
was
pressed
to
my
lips
i
drank
thirstily
and
opened
my
eyes
belleville
white-faced
but
composed
now
and
gloomily
frowning
was
my
minister
i
make
you
my
compliments
he
said
in
cold
slow
even
tones
you
have
a
quick
wit
and
a
nerve
of
iron
i
am
glad
because
they
saved
me
from
a
folly
you
would
cease
to
be
of
use
to
me
dead
curse
you
though
i
wish
you
carrion
and
will
make
you
worm
food
before
i
am
much
older
you'll
not
live
to
repent
it
i
replied
i've
bound
your
fate
with
mine
by
ties
no
mortal
can
unsolve
enough
of
that
rubbish
he
retorted
harshly
you
cannot
haze
me
twice
you
could
not
have
at
all
if
i
had
stopped
to
think
or
been
quite
well
but
i'm
liverish
and
out
of
sorts
to-day--the
result
of
staying
up
all
night
nursing
ottley
you'll
see
when
the
time
comes--if
you
have
the
courage
i
responded
in
an
acrid
tone
you
cannot
scare
me
belleville
because
you
cannot
harm
me
without
hurting
yourself--and
in
your
deeps
of
heart
you
rogue
you
know
it
he
burst
out
laughing
but
there
was
a
note
of
nervousness
in
his
mocking
mirth
that
pleased
me
passing
well
pah
he
said
at
last
would
you
sit
there
trussed
up
like
a
chooky
skewered
for
the
table
if
you
had
the
power
you
pretend
idiot
i
snapped
can
electricity
unbuckle
straps
without
machinery
yet
it
can
splinter
rocks
without
an
effort
and
without
assistance
ah
said
he
ah
so
you
pretend----
try
me
i
interrupted
not
i
cried
he
i've
encountered
so
many
wonders
lately
that
i'm
now
beginning
to
regard
what
i
of
old
considered
the
impossible
as
the
most
likely
thing
of
all
to
happen
i
don't
believe
you
pinsent
but
neither
do
i
disbelieve
you
therefore
acting
on
the
kindly
hint
you
dropped
i'll
take
all
sane
precautions
au
revoir
he
marched
to
the
door
passed
out
and
disappeared
i
chewed
the
bitter
cud
of
thought
for
some
hours
meanwhile
i
grew
desperately
hungry
ay
and
thirsty
too
there
came
a
time
when
i
would
have
given
the
last
of
my
possessions
for
a
beef-steak
and
a
jug
of
water
and
oh
how
tired
i
was
of
my
position
the
blood
gradually
ceased
to
circulate
properly
through
all
my
parts
my
hands
became
purple
my
legs
went
to
sleep
my
limbs
were
on
a
rack
of
pins
and
needles
and
even
breathing
hurt
me
i
did
my
best
by
straining
at
the
bonds
at
intervals
to
promote
the
arterial
flow
and
stop
the
agony
of
muscular
irritation
but
it
was
a
poor
best
and
i
sank
welcomely
at
length
into
a
benumbed
lethargic
state
near
akin
to
stupor
from
which
i
knew
i
could
wake
to
anguish
by
the
merest
movement
as
near
as
i
can
guess
twelve
hours
had
uncoiled
their
lethal
folds
before
my
infernal
captor
returned
to
the
laboratory
one
instant
i
was
sharply
sensible
and
suffering
most
damnably
the
rogue
looked
positively
sick
and
he
smelt
like
a
gin
palace
he
had
evidently
drunk
a
deal
of
spirit
but
he
was
not
the
least
intoxicated
it
is
over
he
cried
and
threw
himself
into
a
chair
what
i
questioned
ottley
is
dead
said
he
and
i
am
glad
of
it
all
said
and
done
though
i
worked
like
a
galley
slave
to
keep
him
by
me
he
was
a
fine
cloak
for
my
doings
but
he
grew
wearisome--the
fractious
old
fool--at
times
and
i'm
not
sure
i'd
bring
him
back
now--were
i
able
and
miss
ottley
a
pretty
scene
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
grimaced
and
whistled
i'm
her
father's
murderer
it
seems
he
stretched
out
his
arms
and
yawned
but
she's
not
responsible
poor
thing--grief
demented
the
two
consulting
physicians
heartily
sympathised
with
me
they
knew
how
i
had
worked
you
see
and
sir
philip
lang
himself
suggested
morphia
they've
signed
a
paper
giving
me
control
of
her--under
their
directions
i'm
trustee
of
the
estate
under
the
will
besides
lang
thinks
she
may
recover--ultimately
but
it
is
evident
that
she
must
be
confined
she
raved
of
mummies
and
spirits
and
dead
men
come
to
life
from
the
sleep
of
ages
and
so
forth
it
impressed
lang
vastly
he
tapped
his
sage
old
head
and
muttered
'too
much
learning'
he
has
a
fad
that
woman's
brains
are
nurtured
best
on
pap
and
i
had
the
tact
to
humour
him
oh
i'm
a
devilish
clever
fellow
pinsent
what
do
you
think
there
is
little
doubt
of
it
i
said
politely
very
politely
indeed
for
i
wished
to
get
as
much
information
from
him
as
i
could
and
also
something
to
eat
and
drink
with
your
brains
you
might
do
anything
i
suspect
i
have
hitherto
misjudged
you
still
i
wonder
that
you
are
not
an
archbishop
it
seems
to
me
the
church
would
give
you
the
proper
cloak
you
need
to
exercise
your
talents
in
gad
he
cried
there's
point
in
that
remark
but
between
ourselves
pinsent
i
aim
at
higher
game
than
spiritual
power
temporal
i
suggested
the
highest
he
answered
sitting
up
and
what's
to
prevent
me
he
asked
defiantly
no
man's
life
is
safe
from
me
i
was
puzzled
you'd
not
make
yourself
eligible
for
kingship
by
killing
kings
i
said
kingship
be
damned
he
sneered
my
father
was
an
earl's
bastard
but
as
for
me
i'm
a
pure
democrat
no
no
i'm
going
to
abolish
royalty
it
has
served
its
turn
but
where
do
you
come
in
the
pleasure
of
the
game
is
mine
the
knowledge
and
the
ecstasy
of
power
unlimited
to
make
and
break
oh
oh
my
tiger
having
tasted
blood
already
once
at
least
the
thirst
grows
on
you
once
at
least--bah
he
jeered
grinning
like
a
fiend
pardon
my
ignorance
i
entreated
who
was
your
latest
victim
navarro
he
answered
grinning
still
the
scamp
is
a
true
clairvoyant
and
had
to
be
shut
up
he
leaped
from
london
bridge
the
night
you
came
here
and
stepped
like
a
poor
rabbit
into
the
trap
i
laid
for
you
well
said
i
in
tones
husky
with
throat
dryness
and
apparent
admiration
that
makes
two--weldon
and
navarro
there
is
a
third
still
he
answered
fairly
snapping
at
the
bait
my
old
grandfather
the
earl
of
havelock
and
why
did
you
murder
him
for
his
snobbish
refusal
to
receive
me
as
his
kin
ten
years
ago
might
one
ask
how
it's
a
story
to
entertain
he
answered
licking
his
lips
he
was
over
eighty
but
he'd
kept
all
his
faculties
else
ther'd
been
no
joy
in
killing
him
a
week
since
i
went
to
him
invisible
entering
the
house
with
my
blood
cousin
now
the
earl
soon
after
midnight
returning
from
a
carousal
he
did
not
see
me
of
course
and
i
took
care
not
to
let
him
hear
but
little
care
was
needed
the
degenerate
was
filthy
drunk
it
was
easy
to
find
the
old
earl's
room
the
young
man
got
so
sober
passing
it
the
door
was
unlocked
too
so
i
had
no
trouble
first
and
last
i
went
over
to
the
old
chap's
bed
and
looked
at
him
and
laughed
to
see
he
slept
with
his
mouth
wide
and
his
toothless
gums
were
hideously
funny
his
teeth
were
in
a
glass
of
h2o
beside
the
bed
i
pulled
his
nose
to
waken
him
having
first
turned
on
the
lights
full
then
i
played
the
ghost
of
my
dead
father
'your
hour
is
come'
says
i
'i'm
the
spirit
of
your
bastard
son
come
to
warn
you'
he
shook
all
over
palsied
with
fear
'no--no--no'
he
gasped
'i'm
not
fit
to
die'
'you're
not
fit
to
live'
i
whispered
stern
as
fate
'how
have
you
treated
the
son
of
your
bastard
son
have
you
been
kind
to
him
and
helped
him
in
the
world'
'mercy
mercy'
he
whined
'i
know
i
have
been
remiss
but
give
one
more
chance--another
year--a
week--a
day--and
i'll
do
my
duty
i'll
bar
the
entail
i'll
give
him
all'
'wretch'
i
hissed--and
sat
me
on
his
chest
it
was
heaven
sweet
to
hear
his
stifled
moans
he
did
not
struggle
at
all
and
my
only
regret
was
it
was
so
soon
over
he
broke
a
vessel
and
smothered
in
his
own
blood
the
papers
announced
next
day
that
he
had
died
of
the
syncope
of
senility
peacefully
while
sleeping
ha
ha
ha
i
echoed
the
heartless
villain's
laugh
croaking
out
guffaws
the
sound
irritated
him
stop
that
raucous
row
he
ordered
then
stop
telling
me
funny
stories
or
else
give
me
something
to
drink
i
snapped
he
sprang
afoot
at
once
lord
he
cried
i'm
not
proposing
to
starve
you
to
death
why
the
deuce
did
you
not
remind
me
you've
been--let's
see--sixty
hours
without
food
sixty
i
gasped
impossible
it's
a
fact
he
said
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
but
he
returned
within
a
few
minutes
carrying
a
tray
set
with
cold
meats
and
wine
which
he
set
on
a
little
table
and
wheeled
before
me
then
he
freed
my
right
hand
and
stood
over
me
with
a
revolver
while
i
ate
but
i
could
not
eat
at
once
for
the
good
reason
that
my
arm
was
paralyzed
and
minutes
passed
before
i
could
make
use
of
it
even
then
it
pained
like
a
raw
scald
but
i
suppressed
a
reference
to
its
condition
and
at
the
earliest
instant
cleared
the
board
in
the
fashion
of
a
famished
wolf
afterwards
he
bound
me
up
again
standing
behind
me
to
do
it
out
of
respect
for
my
strength
no
doubt
then
he
put
up
his
pistol
and
resumed
his
chair
upon
my
soul
i
enjoy
a
chat
with
you
he
assured
me
you
see
i
have
no
one
else
to
confide
in--here
he
grinned--and
there's
a
peculiar
pleasure
in
unbosoming
to
a
helpless
enemy
the
pleasure
is
mutual
i
protested
courteously
no
other
man
has
given
me
such
mental
pabulum
he
closed
one
eye
in
a
very
vulgar
manner
confess
you
expire
with
curiosity
to
hear
more
of
my
beautiful
fiancã©e--the
woman
you
love
the
more
readily
i
responded
because
i
know
you'll
be
delighted
to
taunt
me
with
the
satisfaction
of
that
same
curiosity
ah
said
he
you
are
a
foeman
worthy
of
my
steel
my
heart
warms
with
hate
for
you
respectful
hate
he
took
out
a
silver
pocket
flask
of
spirit
and
filled
the
cup
at
this
he
began
to
sip
eyeing
me
the
while
with
secret
delight
at
my
carefully
repressed
impatience
but
he
was
too
anxious
to
torture
me
directly
to
keep
me
waiting
long
she's
in
a
drugged
sleep
this
moment
he
announced
i'll
keep
her
like
that
till
after
the
funeral
that's
unlike
you
i
remarked
it's
almost
kind
pish
said
he
i
can't
afford
to
let
her
out
of
my
control
even
for
a
moment
so
so
but
you
will
have
to
let
her
see
her
relatives
eh
fortunately
she
hasn't
one
blood
relation
in
england
her
mother
was
an
australian
a
victorian
farmer's
daughter
and
ottley
took
good
care
not
to
marry
the
family
she
has
never
even
seen
one
of
her
mother's
people
but
her
father's
she
is
just
as
fortunately
placed
from
my
point
of
view
in
this
regard
ottley
was
the
only
son
and
although
i
believe
there
is
an
old
maiden
aunt
twice
removed
knocking
round
somewhere
in
wales
i'm
not
afraid
of
her
she's
bed-ridden
and
a
pensioner
as
i'm
trustee
of
the
estate
she'll
do
what
i
tell
her
and
stay
where
she
is
or
i'll
know
the
reason
why
i'm
sure
you
will
i
agreed
with
pious
fervour
the
fates
seem
to
have
deliberately
conspired
to
assist
me
in
every
possible
way
continued
belleville
the
only
real
woman
friend
miss
ottley
had
lady
helen
hubbard
has
gone
to
south
america
with
her
husband
and
the
only
man
friend
who
might
have
helped
her
sits
in
that
chair
there
is
not
another
soul
in
england
who
has
either
the
shadow
of
a
right
or
interest
to
question
my
treatment
i'm
her
sole
trustee
and
as
well
as
that
her
legal
guardian
for
although
she
is
over
age
she
does
not
come
into
control
of
her
fortune
until
she
is
twenty-seven
unless
she
marries
in
the
meanwhile
you
propose
of
course
that
she
shall
marry
you
when
oh
in
a
few
days'
time
it
will
naturally
be
a
secret
marriage
in
order
to
save
scandal
but
i'm
determined
it
shall
take
place
immediately
and
afterwards--how
will
you
treat
her
i
had
hard
work
to
grind
this
question
out
belleville
gave
a
nasty
laugh
that
depends
on
herself
he
answered
if
she
is
a
dutiful
docile
wife
she
will
have
little
cause
to
grumble
and--if
not
you
know
me
and
ask
that
he
cried
then
he
laughed
again
stood
up
and
shook
himself
i'm
going
to
indulge
in
a
nice
comfortable
sleep
he
said
you
may
not
know
it
pinsent
but
it's
almost
midnight
take
my
advice
and
go
to
by-by
too
pleasant
dreams
to
you
and
au
revoir
he
went
out
gaping
with
yawns
but
he
turned
out
the
lights
as
he
went
and
once
more
darkness
enfolded
me
chapter
xxvii
unbound
it
is
not
worth
while
describing
the
next
few
days
they
were
quite
or
almost
colourless
once
each
four
and
twenty
hours
belleville
taking
sound
precautions
released
me
for
a
short
while
from
my
prison
chair
to
let
me
stretch
my
limbs
and
in
the
interests
of
keeping
me
alive
for
his
own
purposes
we
had
very
little
conversation
for
he
had
fallen
into
a
morose
and
gloomy
mood
the
result
of
an
attack
of
insomnia
in
answer
to
direct
questions
i
learned
that
sir
robert
ottley's
funeral
had
passed
without
incident
but
that
miss
ottley's
violent
grief
had
been
succeeded
by
a
long
stupor
she
was
being
nursed
by
a
creature
of
belleville's
an
old
frenchwoman
named
elise
lorraine
in
whom
he
evidently
reposed
a
deal
of
confidence
belleville
spent
most
of
his
time
at
work
in
the
laboratory
but
what
he
did
i
could
not
see
for
he
conducted
his
labours
behind
my
chair
on
one
occasion
he
gave
way
to
a
savage
fit
of
passion
and
without
any
cause
whatever
that
i
could
perceive
he
broke
a
number
of
glass
implements
upon
the
floor
another
time
having
cut
his
hand
in
some
experiment
he
revenged
himself
by
flogging
me
with
a
piece
of
whalebone
until
my
flesh
wherever
he
could
reach
it
was
covered
with
weals
and
blisters
he
was
not
a
nice
man
to
live
with
and
my
hatred
of
him
grew
daily
more
intense
but
perforce
i
was
civil
to
him
on
the
eighth
day
he
entered
the
room
with
a
chalk-white
face
i
knew
at
once
that
something
had
happened
but
i
was
not
to
learn
what
it
was
immediately
he
disappeared
forthwith
behind
my
chair
and
for
ten
minutes
stamped
about
swearing
like
a
pagan
then
the
lights
went
out
of
a
sudden
and
he
departed
in
the
dark
he
returned
about
four
hours
later
but
i
did
not
see
him
enter
although
he
put
on
the
lights
immediately
i
heard
him
pass
my
chair
that
was
all
but
a
few
seconds
later
a
sharp
and
most
acridly
irritating
odour
filled
the
room
and
soon
afterwards
he
came
forward
and
sank
into
his
accustomed
chair
opposite
to
mine
he
looked
positively
ghastly
to-morrow
morning
england
will
mourn
the
loss
of
her
greatest
physician
he
announced
in
quivering
tones
sir
philip
lang
has
just
committed
suicide
what
i
cried
in
deep
astonishment
sir
philip
lang
he
bared
his
teeth
the
world
will
think
so
he
snarled
but
in
reality--but
there
you
shall
judge
this
afternoon
without
giving
me
notice
the
fool
came
to
this
house
forced
his
way
into
the
sick
room
and
had
a
long
private
conversation
with
may
ottley
i
do
not
know
to
what
conclusion
he
came
but
she
must
have
persuaded
him
of
her
sanity
for
he
ordered
elise
to
take
her
out
for
a
walk
and
if
it
had
not
been
that
elise
refused
to
obey
him
pending
my
arrival
there
would
have
been
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
for
me
to
fry
however
he
won't
trouble
me
again
you
murdered
him
i
gasped
like
an
artist
said
belleville
i
stole
upon
him
while
he
sat
in
his
private
sitting-room
at
supper
and
standing
opposite
to
him
unseen
i
reached
out
and
poured
some
aconite
into
his
wine
he
was
dead
inside
a
quarter
hour
and
i
took
care
that
he
made
no
outcry
the
verdict
should
be
suicide
i
think
don't
you
with
that
he
got
up
and
left
me
that
night
while
i
slept
he
dosed
me
with
chloroform
and
while
i
was
senseless
he
drew
over
my
clothes
a
suit
of
rubber
overalls
he
also
did
whatever
was
necessary
to
render
me
invisible
and
he
gagged
me
with
a
piece
of
steel
thrust
under
my
tongue
and
secured
around
my
throat
and
neck
with
fine
wire
that
bit
deep
in
the
flesh
i
awoke
groaning
with
agony
to
find
that
i
was
stretched
out
on
the
naked
framework
of
an
iron
bed
belleville
stood
over
me
grasping
miss
ottley
by
the
hand
when
i
saw
her
i
stopped
groaning
as
if
by
instinct
i
knew
at
once
that
she
did
not
see
anything
except
the
bed
she
looked
well
but
tragically
sorrowful
and
wild
she
was
staring
as
it
were
through
me
you
see
nothing
said
belleville's
hollow
voice
but
his
spirit
lies
there
for
all
that
it
is
in
my
power
and
cannot
escape
without
i
set
it
free
you
know
my
price
it
is
for
you
to
rule
his
fate
through
me
if
so
you
wish
what
he
continued
do
you
not
believe--well
then
look
now
of
a
sudden
he
flashed
a
blue
lighted
lanthorn
into
my
face
and
he
did
something
else
which
sent
a
thousand
stinging
currents
of
electric
anguish
quivering
along
my
nerves
i
uttered
a
shriek
but
the
gag
stifled
it
to
a
hissing
wail
and
then
i
fell
to
breathing
groans
hell
can
have
no
worse
torments
than
that
villain
had
devised
for
my
undoing
had
my
mouth
been
unfettered
i
should
have
besought
the
woman
i
adored
for
death
at
any
price
for
rest
of
pain
as
it
was
i
prayed
her
with
my
eyes--and
she
saw
and
took
a
message
let
him
go
she
sobbed
and
i
will
marry
you
oh
this
is
horrible
on
instant
the
blue
light
faded
out
and
a
blessed
heaven
of
diminished
torture
gave
me
peace
belleville
took
from
his
breast
a
naked
dagger
which
he
put
into
the
girl's
hand
strike
then
he
said
strike
here
and
he
put
his
finger
on
my
breast
the
devil
proposed
to
make
his
innocent
victim
a
murderess
i
saw
his
purpose
and
with
every
atom
of
my
strength
i
groaned
it
was
the
only
warning
i
could
send
but
i
had
played
right
into
belleville's
hands
hear
him
implore
you
cried
belleville
oh
i
can't
i
can't
she
wailed
'tis
only
a
spirit--and
it's
the
only
way
he
protested
warmly
miss
ottley
swung
around
suddenly
and
drove
the
dagger
at
his
heart
but
he
had
been
expecting
it
he
caught
her
wrist
and
laughed
then
all
my
anguish
recommenced
in
the
midst
of
it
made
desperate
the
girl
leaned
right
across
the
bed
and
struck
the
blade
glanced
down
upon
a
rib
and
deeply
pierced
my
side
providence
surely
had
directed
the
blow
she
withdrew
the
dagger
then
screamed
aloud
to
see
it
dripping
with
blood
belleville
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
bore
her
roughly
back
he
bent
her
body
on
a
table
until
she
was
as
helpless
as
a
dove
then
took
the
blade
and
drew
the
horrid
thing
across
her
lips
so
they
were
carmined
with
my
blood
by
this
and
this
you'll
remember
you
are
mine
he
said
and
kissed
her
lips
till
his
were
bloody
too
then
the
two
stared
deep
into
each
other's
eyes
i've
killed
his
body
you
his
soul
said
belleville
we're
well
mated
you
and
i
there--i've
no
longer
any
fear
you'll
hurt
yourself
you'll
be
henceforth
too
much
afraid
of
him
to
die
he
let
her
go
and
stood
away
from
her
she
swayed
erect
then
came
forward
till
she
stood
beside
me
i
held
my
very
breath
for
fear
that
she
would
hear
i
don't
know
why
it
is
all
a
trick--a
cruel
devilish
trick
there's
nothing
there
said
the
girl
her
bosom
heaving
as
she
spoke
belleville
laughed
like
a
hyena
feel--if
you
dare
he
cried
but
she
took
him
at
his
word
her
hands
went
out
and
guided
by
a
dark
blotch
which
as
afterwards
i
learned
she
saw
she
put
them
on
my
wound
and
drew
them
swiftly
back
ensanguined
then
horror
settled
on
her
like
a
black
cloud
on
a
mountain
top
she
turned
about
with
one
loud
gasping
sigh
and
sank
down
in
a
lifeless
heap
at
belleville's
feet
soon
afterwards
i
swooned
too
from
pain
and
loss
of
blood
when
i
awoke
my
wound
was
neatly
bandaged
and
i
was
once
more
seated
in
my
chair
belleville
sat
opposite
smoking
a
cigar
he
was
dressed
very
smartly
in
a
frock
suit
and
a
tall
hat
was
set
jauntily
on
his
brow
he
wore
a
geranium
in
his
buttonhole
his
face
was
wreathed
in
smiles
a
bottle
of
champagne
was
set
before
him
on
a
table
and
he
sipped
at
a
glass
with
an
air
of
triumphant
good-humour
i
found
that
i
could
speak
my
gag
had
been
removed
water
i
implored
him
he
started
then
pressed
forward
with
his
glass
where
the
devil
is
your
mouth
he
said
he
could
not
see
me
that
was
plain
here
said
i
water
it
is
my
wedding
morn--and
you
shall
toast
me
in
wine
or
go
thirsting
he
rapped
out
then
he
found
my
lips
and
i
drank
life
into
my
veins
i
have
never
tasted
draught
one-half
so
glorious
i
was
married
less
than
an
hour
ago
he
said
at
a
registrar's
office
she's
no
longer
miss
ottley
pinsent
i
was
silent
do
you
hear
me
man
he
demanded
i
hear
i
answered
he
nodded
his
head
and
smiled
i
suppose
you
are
wondering
why
you're
still
alive
eh
you'll
die
when
i
die
i
muttered
wearily
you
are
afraid
to
kill
me
that
is
why
bosh
he
flashed
back
i
have
a
better
reason
far
to-morrow
she
will
be
my
wife
indeed--a
maid
no
longer--pinsent
it
was
worth
keeping
you
alive
to
gloat
on
that
oh
i
see
but
you
don't
see
everything
pinsent
she
insists
upon
seeing
your
body
to-day
in
order
to
be
sure
that
you
are
dead
ah
she
still
has
a
lingering
doubt
that
i
have
tricked
her
and
she
has
sworn
on
the
cross
that
unless
i
produce
your
corpse
for
her
inspection
she
will
take
her
own
life
rather
than--you
can
guess
what
pinsent
yes--i
can
guess
so
you
see
the
time
draws
nigh
for
you
to
die
god
only
knows
the
villain
frowned
but
before
you
go
you
must
do
something
for
me
and
that
you
must
write
her
a
letter
telling
her
that
your
only
hope
of
soul
resurrection
and
salvation
lies
in
her
obeying
me
she
now
considers
me
a
dangerous
magician
but
i
want
her
to
regard
me
as
a
sort
of
deity
i
will
not
do
it
belleville
you
ought
to
know
me
better
by
this
i
think
you
will
said
he
that
is
if
you
really
care
for
her
you
see
it
will
save
her
a
lot
of--let's
call
it
inconvenience
with
such
a
weapon
as
your
message
i
can
rule
her
kindly
but
rule
her
in
any
case
i
shall
if
you
deny
me
i'll
gag
you
this
moment
so
you
can't
make
a
sound
then
i'll
bring
her
here
and
beat
her
as
i
would
a
dog
how
will
you
like
that
i'll
write
the
letter
i
said
huskily
a
few
minutes
later
the
thing
was
done
and
i
had
signed
my
name
to
the
atrocious
expressions
of
his
demand
to
transcribe
them
i
am
too
ashamed
what
now
i
asked
the
last
scene
in
the
last
act
said
he
as
he
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
i
may
tell
you
that
i
intend
always
to
keep
your
body
by
me--for
her
to
look
at--if
she
ever
shows
a
mind
to
mutiny
in
spirits
i
questioned
the
embalming
oil
of
the
princes
of
old
egypt
i
found
the
receipt
in
ptahmes'
tomb
he
answered
i
propose
to
convert
you
into
a
mummy
with
that
he
took
off
his
hat
and
coat
rolled
up
his
sleeves
and
put
on
a
huge
oil-skin
apron
i'll
not
kill
you
till
the
last
moment
necessary
he
observed
in
fact
you'll
be
half-mummy
before
you
die
i
have
a
curiosity
to
discover
if
the
process
of
substitution
is
painful
i
rather
think
it
must
be
he
moved
over
as
he
spoke
to
the
sarcophagus
and
began
to
shift
the
objects
that
sealed
up
the
mouth
it
took
him
some
minutes
to
do
so
and
as
he
put
down
the
couch
last
of
all
one
of
the
castors
crashed
upon
his
toe
he
cursed
the
misfortune
like
a
madman
and
danced
about
the
floor
on
one
foot
like
a
dervish
winding
up
by
striking
me
brutally
with
closed
fist
on
the
lips
that
gave
him
back
his
self-control
i'll
teach
you
to
laugh
at
me
he
growled
then
he
returned
to
his
work
and
stooping
over
the
great
coffin
he
hauled
out
the
lifeless
mummy
that
had
rested
there
so
long
for
an
instant
i
glimpsed
the
strange
dead
features
of
the
dust
of
ptahmes
which
so
strikingly
resembled
the
effigy
carven
on
the
lid
of
the
sarcophagus
and
also
the
arab
who
had
twice
in
egypt
attempted
to
destroy
me
then
belleville
carelessly
threw
the
thing
upon
the
couch
and
traversed
the
room
to
where
stood
three
glass
jars
filled
with
a
dark
viscous
fluid
one
by
one
he
rolled
these
on
end
across
the
floor
till
all
three
stood
beside
the
coffin
afterwards
he
disappeared
behind
my
chair
returning
soon
his
head
covered
with
a
long
breathing
mask
i
watched
him--one
may
guess
with
what
passionate
attention
he
unscrewed
the
stopper
of
the
nearest
jar
seized
the
thing
bodily
in
his
arms
and
poured
out
the
contents
into
the
sarcophagus
a
curious
cloud-like
steam
arose
that
hazed
the
prospect
but
soon
it
dissipated
the
air
was
filled
with
the
perfume
i
had
first
smelt
in
the
cave
temple
of
the
hill
of
rakh
but
it
was
not
altogether
overpowering
it
made
my
pulses
throb
and
brought
a
great
rush
of
blood
to
my
head
and
hands
and
feet
much
as
would
the
scent
of
amyl
nitrate
but
it
did
not
take
away
my
senses
belleville
protected
by
his
mask
was
in
no
way
affected
he
quickly
unstoppered
the
second
jar
and
added
its
contents
to
the
first
then
he
turned
and
approached
me
taking
off
his
helmet
as
he
came
the
action
apprised
me
that
the
wonderful
perfume
had
almost
died
away
there
was
now
a
healthy
and
stimulating
odour
in
the
room
that
resembled
boiling
tar
evidently
the
two
jars
had
contained
different
chemicals
a
loud
seething
bubbling
sound
was
plainly
to
be
heard
it
came
from
the
sarcophagus
belleville
sat
down
and
wiped
his
forehead
with
a
handkerchief
we
must
give
the
stuff
ten
minutes
to
mix
he
said
and
taking
out
his
watch
he
glanced
at
the
time
it's
twenty
past
eleven
he
remarked
you'll
begin
to
mummify
at
the
half
hour
precisely
pinsent
so
if
you
are
a
religious
man
you'd
best
compose
your
soul
in
prayer
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
followed
his
advice
i
closed
my
eyes
and
asked
the
omnipotent
for
remission
of
my
sins
and
since
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
hour
had
come
i
resolutely
put
aside
my
detestation
of
the
monster
who
designed
to
murder
me
and
i
even
asked
for
his
forgiveness
too
then
a
great
deep
splendid
peace
mantled
over
me
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
truly
realised
the
littleness
of
man's
existence
and
the
majesty
of
resignation
it
was
almost
worth
while
to
go
through
all
i
had
been
compelled
to
endure
to
experience
at
the
end
that
mood
of
grand
calm
dignity
i
felt
almost
sublimely
detached
from
my
surroundings
i
opened
my
eyes
at
last
and
said
with
perfect
calm
i
am
ready
belleville
he
stood
up
and
stretched
out
his
arms
yawning
widely
then
of
a
sudden
everything
was
dark
what
in
hell----
shouted
belleville
i
heard
him
rush
forward
cursing
angrily
then
he
stumbled
and
fell
headlong
to
the
floor
amidst
a
crash
of
glass
in
the
same
instant
unseen
hands
fumbled
over
me
my
bonds
suddenly
relaxed
and
i
was
free
i
stood
up
stiff
but
quivering
in
every
nerve
there
followed
a
rasping
sound
a
match
flickered
into
light
and
i
saw
belleville
rising
from
the
ruins
of
a
broken
jar
he
held
the
lucifer
above
his
head
and
it
showed
standing
at
an
angle
between
us
the
tall
frame
of
the
arab
of
the
cave
temple
at
rakh
belleville
ripped
out
an
oath
there
came
a
blinding
flash
of
light
and
the
deafening
report
of
a
revolver
i
staggered
from
the
chair
to
the
wall
and
leaned
against
it
helpless
as
a
babe
the
echoes
were
still
thundering
in
rolling
waves
of
brain-dazing
sound
from
wall
to
wall
when
the
pitch
blackness
of
the
room
was
again
relieved
by
the
glare
of
electricity
belleville
had
succeeded
in
turning
on
the
lights
he
stood
by
the
door
peering
all
about
him
for
a
moment
i
thought
all
was
up
i
was
free
certainly
but
my
muscles
were
so
cramped
and
tautened
that
i
could
hardly
move
a
finger
i
was
not
fit
to
contend
against
a
breath
of
wind
let
alone
a
burly
ruffian
like
the
doctor
but
the
next
instant
i
remembered
i
was
still
invisible
i
could
not
see
my
own
hand
held
before
me
and
i
had
immediate
proof
that
he
was
unable
to
perceive
me
where
are
you
pinsent
are
you
hurt
he
cried
i
did
not
answer
but
following
his
glance
i
looked
at
the
couch
and
there
i
saw
what
utterly
astounded
me
the
mummy
of
ptahmes
lay
upon
the
couch
in
exactly
the
same
attitude
as
when
belleville
had
flung
it
there
aside
from
the
sarcophagus
who
then
or
what
had
set
me
free
i
examined
the
apartment
eagerly
but
saw
nothing
living
save
belleville
who
with
cocked
revolver
thrust
out
before
him
now
stepped
forward
cautiously
into
the
room
waving
his
arms
about
him
as
he
walked
and
muttering
as
he
walked
through
clenched
teeth
a
string
of
angry
blasphemies
chapter
xxviii
the
struggle
in
the
chamber
the
advantage
i
possessed
was
dangerously
minimised
by
my
physical
incapacity
but
i
hoped
given
time
to
get
back
some
measure
of
strength
the
great
thing
was
to
preserve
my
liberty
until
i
had
acquired
force
enough
to
use
it
i
speedily
realised
that
i
could
not
remain
where
i
was
for
belleville
was
making
towards
me
and
reflection
would
soon
teach
him
that
weakness
would
compel
me
to
seek
a
prop
for
my
support
but
i
feared
to
move
lest
the
sound
should
betray
my
whereabouts
for
the
same
reason
i
almost
feared
to
breathe
i
thought
to
myself
oh
that
he
would
fire
again
so
that
i
could
move
elsewhere
under
cover
of
the
noise
once
or
twice
he
seemed
to
look
me
in
the
eye
he
made
a
zigzag
to
my
chair
there
he
paused
and
listened
i
ceased
to
breathe
only
six
feet
separated
us
but
impatience
consumed
him
tell
me
where
you
are
he
growled
or
by
the
lord
when
i
catch
you
i'll
tear
you
limb
from
limb
i
breathed
while
he
spoke
and
ceased
when
he
stopped
you
can't
escape
me
he
snarled
i've
only
to
light
my
blue
lamp
and
i'll
find
you
in
a
minute
but
if
you
put
me
to
that
trouble
and
make
me
waste
my
precious
oil
besides
well
look
out
that's
all
i
clenched
and
unclenched
my
hands
the
use
of
them
was
coming
back
to
me
very
well
said
belleville
he
passed
my
chair
and
stalked
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
he
opened
a
cabinet
i
moved
slowly
and
painfully
to
the
very
centre
of
the
room
then
i
stood
stock
still
belleville
returning
paused
within
a
foot
of
me
he
carried
a
bull's-eye
lanthorn
this
he
put
upon
the
table
and
presently
he
struck
a
match
a
moment
later
a
round
shaft
of
intense
blue
radiance
shot
across
the
room
and
marked
a
moon-shaped
sphere
on
the
wall
it
began
to
flit
along
the
wall
up
and
down
from
the
very
floor
to
the
height
of
a
man's
chest
until
it
touched
the
corner
then
it
flashed
back
twice
over
the
same
path
and
afterwards
attacked
the
next
wall
sooner
or
later
it
would
be
bound
to
encounter
and
perhaps
discover
me
but
belleville
was
only
a
few
feet
off
perhaps
if
i
sank
down
the
shaft
would
pass
over
me
without
touching
at
least
i
could
try
suppressing
a
shriek
of
agony
i
crouched
upon
my
hands
and
knees
then
came
another
thought
slowly
and
laboriously
i
began
to
crawl
nearer
and
nearer
to
my
enemy
the
blue
shaft
was
now
shooting
right
over
my
head
i
crept
behind
him
and
breathing
noiselessly
stood
up
if
i
had
possessed
a
tithe
of
my
strength
i
might
have
reached
out
and
caught
his
neck
and
strangled
him
with
ease
but
i
dared
not
risk
it
all
on
a
sudden
he
uttered
an
oath
the
lamp
had
gone
out
damn
the
thing
he
growled
putting
down
his
revolver
on
the
table
he
opened
the
lamp
and
peered
in
at
the
smoking
wick
we
were
now
face
to
face
and
his
cocked
weapon
lay
within
eighteen
inches
of
my
hand
i
tried
my
fingers
and
found
that
they
were
reasonably
supple
the
blood
was
streaming
through
the
puffy
veins
and
vesicles
the
operation
hurt
horribly
in
fact
i
was
one
mass
of
crude
raw
painful
man
flesh
but
now
i
was
full
of
hope
and
despite
the
muscular
torments
of
returning
animation
i
felt
that
my
vigour
was
returning
belleville
snuffed
the
wick
and
struck
a
match
along
the
table
the
head
came
off
he
took
another
and
rubbed
it
on
the
sole
of
his
shoe
stooping
slightly
to
do
so
as
he
moved
i
reached
out
and
twined
my
fingers
round
the
hilt
of
his
revolver
but
i
had
not
the
strength
to
lift
it
up
i
cannot
paint
the
agony
of
that
experience
i
exerted
every
atom
of
my
will
but
my
hand
was
like
a
putty
puppet
tantalus
never
suffered
torture
half
as
keen
withdrawing
my
hand
i
put
the
fingers
in
my
mouth
and
sucked
the
still
half-lifeless
digits
meanwhile
the
lamp
flickered
alight
belleville
took
up
his
revolver
and
resumed
his
task
i
watched
him
hungrily
the
blue
shaft
once
more
began
to
play
and
stab
the
walls
it
darted
hither
and
thither
like
an
incandescent
elf
dancing
up
and
down
and
round
and
round
and
into
every
hole
and
cranny
of
the
room
but
it
did
not
find
me
out
because
moving
round
and
round
the
table
as
belleville
moved
i
always
kept
behind
him
but
this
could
not
last
for
ever
and
indeed
the
end
came
too
soon
belleville
uttered
suddenly
a
savage
curse
and
swung
round
full
upon
me
perhaps
i
had
made
some
sound
that
had
betrayed
me
to
his
nerve-strained
senses
i
do
not
know
he
cried
ha
at
last
and
fired
point
blank
the
bullet
whistled
past
my
temple
the
smoke
of
the
discharge
flamed
blue
in
the
rays
of
the
lanthorn
i
fell
upon
the
table
and
thrust
it
like
a
ram
with
all
my
force
against
my
adversary
he
fired
again
and
once
more
missed
but
ere
he
could
repeat
his
tactics
the
table
struck
him
and
the
lanthorn
fell
he
staggered
back
and
the
lanthorn
rolled
underneath
the
table
i
pushed
the
table
forward
and
kicked
the
lanthorn
with
my
foot
it
went
out
belleville
recovering
his
equilibrium
stood
like
an
image
peering
straight
at
me
and
listening
yet
he
did
not
see
me
and
for
the
moment
i
was
safe
for
the
table
was
between
us
but
the
man
had
brains
judging
swiftly
where
i
was
most
likely
to
be
he
gave
an
unexpected
spring
and
vaulted
clear
across
the
obstacle
i
had
just
time
to
step
back
ere
he
landed
he
swung
his
arms
about
like
flails
but
failing
immediately
to
find
me
his
ugly
temper
must
needs
flare
up
in
curses
it
was
just
what
i
needed
to
cover
the
sound
of
my
movements
i
evaded
him
and
returned
to
the
table
and
then
he
knew
not
where
i
was
in
a
few
moments
he
realised
his
folly
and
once
more
relapsing
into
silence
he
took
up
his
lamp
but
the
oil
had
either
been
wasted
or
was
exhausted
the
wick
refused
to
catch
he
groaned
out
a
blasphemous
oath
on
this
discovery
and
rushed
down
to
the
cabinet
from
which
first
he
had
procured
the
lanthorn
i
followed
him
as
swiftly
as
i
could
having
care
to
make
no
sound
and
while
he
was
filling
the
lamp
with
oil
from
a
beautifully
carven
vase
of
solid
gold
egyptian
ware
of
the
fifteenth
dynasty
i
once
more
put
my
hand
upon
the
hilt
of
his
revolver
which
he
had
momentarily
laid
upon
the
edge
of
the
cabinet
but
this
time
i
found
i
could
hold
and
use
it
too
shadow-like
i
caught
it
up
and
put
my
finger
on
the
trigger
then
i
backed
away
a
yard
or
two
and
leaned
upon
a
case
of
glass
and
steel
belleville
said
i
he
started
as
though
an
adder
had
stung
him
then
seeing
his
pistol
gone
he
let
both
vase
and
lanthorn
fall
in
his
dismay
and
swung
on
heel
to
face
my
voice
it's
my
turn
now
i
muttered
hands
above
your
head--up
man
up--higher--higher
he
saw
the
muzzle
pointing
at
his
breast
and
sullenly
obeyed
i
made
him
walk
backwards
to
the
chair
that
formerly
had
prisoned
me
and
sit
in
it
and
then
the
steel
pressed
to
his
ear
to
keep
him
still
i
managed
with
one
hand
to
pass
a
strap
around
his
throat
and
buckle
it
afterwards
i
similarly
bound
his
wrists
and
ankles
when
all
was
done
i
was
so
sore
spent
so
hideously
full
of
weary
pain
that
i
lay
upon
the
floor
and
sank
immediately
into
a
troubled
sleep
belleville
woke
me
with
his
struggles
to
get
free
somehow
or
other
he
had
pryed
himself
on
tiptoe
backward
and
the
heavy
chair
overbalancing
had
dragged
him
over
in
its
fall
that
i
had
not
heard
but
the
weight
of
iron
and
his
own
body
was
all
curiously
pressed
upon
one
forearm
and
the
pain
of
it
set
him
groaning
like
a
wounded
bull
the
strangest
thing
of
all
was
that
this
arm
was
free
somehow
or
other
he
had
writhed
it
loose
after
i
had
tied
it
up
again
i
sat
down
to
think
what
i
should
do
i
was
not
however
in
the
mood
to
sit
in
judgment
on
him
then
for
although
much
stronger
from
my
sleep
the
exertion
hurt
and
every
pang
i
suffered
was
too
powerful
an
advocate
of
vengeance
to
let
me
try
the
rascal
soberly
i
needed
food
and
drink
not
finding
any
in
the
room
i
tried
the
door
and
after
some
short
search
made
out
its
fastening--a
simple
but
clever
slip
of
prodigious
strength
i
found
the
key
to
it
in
belleville's
pocket
he
was
madly
anxious
to
be
made
acquainted
with
his
fate
but
i
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
all
his
questions
and
slipping
out
of
the
room
i
slammed
the
door
on
his
solicitations
i
found
myself
in
a
long
blind
passage
lighted
with
a
single
jet
with
another
padded
door
set
in
its
farthest
end
this
opened
to
the
same
key
as
the
first
it
gave
me
egress
on
a
second
passage
which
led
by
three
right
angles
to
a
big
velvet-draped
arch
and
a
bifurcated
maze
of
broad-balconied
corridors
here
i
saw
the
natural
light
of
day
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
a
week
ah
how
i
revelled
in
it
i
stopped
before
an
open
window
and
peered
forth
on
a
walled
courtyard
and
the
blank
tall
wall
of
a
neighbouring
mansion
beyond
street
sounds
percolated
to
my
ears
it
was
like
coming
back
to
life
from
the
grave
drawing
back
from
the
window
after
some
deep
delicious
moments
i
looked
to
find
my
body
and
my
hands
and
feet
but
i
could
not
see
aught
but
vague
delusive
shadows
though
the
sunbeams
glistened
on
me
the
phenomenon
filled
me
with
a
new
sense
of
marvel
and
uncertainty
i
had
to
pinch
myself
to
make
sure
i
was
not
a
disembodied
phantom--such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
yet
i
was
real
enough
to
touch
thank
heaven
reassured
i
made
for
the
nearest
door
and
softly
tried
it
within
was
a
man's
bedroom--belleville's
perhaps
it
was
untenanted
the
next
apartment
was
a
sitting-room
it
was
also
untenanted
but
it
contained
a
table
cover-spread
for
two
with
a
sigh
of
joy
i
entered
and
hurried
to
the
table
under
the
first
cover
was
a
cold
partridge
pie
i
did
not
touch
the
others
but
lord
how
i
enjoyed
that
pie
i
might
have
been
a
wolf--and
then
champagne
later
seduced
by
an
open
cigar-box
on
the
mantel
i
threw
myself
upon
a
lounge
and
lit
a
weed
in
ten
minutes
i
was
my
own
man
again
and
almost
comfortable
for
the
torments
that
had
racked
my
wretched
muscles
on
reawakening
from
their
tethered
lethargy
were
disappearing
fast
but
i
was
not
permitted
longer
rest
warned
by
a
tap
on
the
door
i
had
barely
time
to
toss
my
cigar
into
the
grate
when
the
door
opened
and
a
short
squat
negro
stepped
into
the
room
he
carried
a
salver
of
sweetmeats
to
the
table
he
stopped
short
and
uttered
a
guttural
exclamation
of
surprise
next
instant
he
was
joined
by
a
companion
but
no
negro
an
arab
a
tall
thin
arab
who
was
the
living
counterpart
of
the
mummified
corpse
of
ptahmes
i
had
left
in
the
laboratory
and
of
the
mysterious
scoundrel
who
had
attempted
my
life
in
the
cave
temple
at
rakh
and
at
my
camp
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
i
was
so
utterly
astounded
that
i
wonder
i
did
not
shout
out
my
amazement
the
negro
spoke
in
arabic
by
allah
he
has
eaten
and
alone
he
cried
now
tell
me
ptahmes
how
a
man
shall
serve
a
master
with
so
little
feeling
for
his
servants
the
arab
stalked
solemnly
over
to
the
table
and
eyed
the
ruined
pie
he
hungered
he
ate
may
his
shadow
increase
he
drawled
for
my
part
retorted
the
nubian
with
an
ill-natured
scowl
his
shadow
may
wither
and
i
shall
not
grieve
it
is
impossible
to
please
him
his
gold
is
good
and
hard
and
yellow
and
much
said
the
arab
in
a
sort
of
sing-song
add
to
that
ill-got
replied
the
negro
and
i
shall
be
an
echo
to
your
speech
natamkin
tells
me
that
the
lady
weeps
still
though
no
more
a
prisoner
and
he
took
her
forth
into
his
whirling
babel
town
this
morning
he
has
put
a
spell
on
her
to
deprive
her
of
her
gold
what
matter
if
he
shares
it
with
his
slaves
demanded
the
arab
i
fear
him
said
the
nubian
i
also
drawled
the
arab
but
guard
your
idle
tongue
uromi
he
may
be
listening
to
us
now
the
negro
shuddered
and
made
as
if
to
hastily
depart
but
the
arab
laughed
and
he
stopped
looking
both
angry
and
ashamed
allah
he
exclaimed
you
laugh
but
you
may
have
spoken
true
ugh
said
the
arab
he
has
bigger
fish
to
fry--the
white
man
you
enticed
into
the
room
of
wonders
dies
to-day
you--know
that
ptahmes
ay--i
am
to
help
him
to
embalm
the
body
now
i
think
of
it
i
wonder
he
has
eaten
i
was
to
stir
the
pot
while
he
made
merry
with
the
lady
over
wine--the
unbelieving
dog
at
one
of
the
clock
he
ordered
me
to
go
to
him
'tis
almost
time
will
you
not
fear
to
stay
alone
in
that
great
room
of
magic
ptahmes
like
enough
uromi
but
i
shall
think
me
of
the
pay
and
work
with
tight-shut
eyes
till
he
returns
what
has
he
promised
you
five
pieces
of
gold
uromi
do
you
covet
them
i
would
not
cross
the
threshold
of
that
room
for
ten
times
five
you
have
a
chicken's
heart
uromi
and
you
a
miser's
gizzard
the
arab
uttered
a
sardonic
laugh
get
to
your
woman's
work
he
sneered
and
clear
those
things
away
you
had
better
tell
natamkin
to
serve
the
lady
in
her
room
and
you--oh
great
lord
growled
the
nubian
with
elephantine
sarcasm
the
arab
however
did
not
trouble
himself
to
answer
with
a
mien
of
princely
dignity
he
stalked
in
silence
to
the
door
and
vanished
i
said
to
myself
there
without
doubt
goes
the
man
who
in
the
nick
of
time
released
me
from
my
bonds
he
is
my
friend
the
reflection
gave
me
substantial
satisfaction
for
much
against
my
will
i
had
hitherto
been
compelled
to
ascribe
my
salvation
to
a
supernatural
agency
but
now
all
was
changed
without
doubt
the
arab
had
been
secretly
watching
over
me
and
when
the
time
came
he
turned
out
the
lights
rushed
into
the
laboratory
and
unfastened
my
straps
afterwards
he
had
adroitly
managed
to
escape
before
belleville
could
turn
on
the
lights
again
no
doubt
too
this
arab
was
the
man
of
my
dream
who
had
bargained
with
me
to
kill
belleville
when
i
got
free
to
destroy
the
mummy
of
ptahmes
the
priest
of
amen-ra--and
his
papyri
and
steles
why
he
should
have
driven
such
a
bargain
i
could
not
fathom
and
why
moreover
he
should
have
taken
the
trouble
to
impersonate
the
mummy
and
pretend
he
could
not
speak
i
was
also
at
a
loss
to
understand
suddenly
i
remembered
that
the
animated
mummy
of
my
dream
had
conversed
with
me
in
the
tongue
of
ancient
egypt
per
medium
of
a
slate
and
had
seemed
not
to
understand
modern
arabic
also
his
left
hand
had
been
removed--and
this
arab
enjoyed
the
undiminished
use
of
his
my
head
whirled
at
the
contemplation
of
these
essential
contradictions
were
they
one
and
the
same
man
or
not
was
it
possible
that
belleville's
arab
servant
could
be
a
professor
of
the
language
of
sesostris
and
i
recollected
too
how
closely
i
had
scrutinised
the
ghostly
mummy's
face
and
realised
its
utter
deadness
the
mystery
after
all
was
not
to
be
as
easily
solved
as
my
first
warm
flush
of
fancy
had
conceived
realising
this
i
put
it
out
of
mind
and
arose
to
address
myself
to
the
practical
affair
that
lay
before
me
the
nubian
was
in
the
act
of
quitting
the
room
laden
with
a
heavy
tray
of
dishes
i
followed
him
out
into
the
corridor
and
leisurely
made
back
to
the
laboratory
i
met
nobody
en
route
but
once
inside
the
blind
passage
which
opened
on
my
old
prison
chamber
i
became
aware
that
something
had
gone
wrong
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
mysterious
scent
of
the
sarcophagus
moreover
the
door
of
the
laboratory
which
i
had
been
careful
to
shut
close
was
now
ajar
instinctively
i
slipped
the
key
i
had
just
used
on
the
outer
door
into
my
mouth
and
hurried
softly
up
the
passage
there
a
bewildering
surprise
awaited
me
the
laboratory
was
apparently
untenanted
by
living
beings
the
mummy
of
ptahmes
still
lay
upon
the
couch
the
straps
which
had
fastened
belleville
to
the
chair
were
all
unfastened
and
belleville
himself
had
disappeared
yet
there
were
noises
in
the
room
noises
of
footfalls
and
the
tinkling
of
glass
presently
i
saw
a
large
glass
phial
move
quietly
from
a
marble
slab
and
stand
poised
in
air
a
second
later
the
stopper
which
had
been
laid
beside
it
sprang
up
too
and
settled
neatly
in
the
phial's
mouth
then
the
bottle
leaped
up
high
into
the
air
and
settled
with
mysterious
precision
on
a
shelf
i
stared
at
these
wonders
half-understanding
half-dazed
but
soon
i
comprehended
all
belleville's
voice
speaking
in
arabic
came
to
me
through
the
hush
that
will
do
i
think
there
only
remains
for
us
to
steal
upon
him
now
and
take
him
by
surprise
serve
me
well
in
this
ptahmes
and
i
shall
treble
your
reward
the
man
is
of
iron
strength
master
answered
the
arab's
voice
it
is
true
that
we
are
two
to
one
and
he
is
unsuspicious
but
i
should
like
well
to
have
a
knife
nonsense
retorted
belleville
i
cannot
make
steel
invisible
we
must
needs
trust
to
the
sandbags
now
lead
on
to
the
lady's
room
and
take
care
from
this
moment
that
you
make
no
sound
on
this
i
left
the
doorway
and
slipping
into
the
opposite
corner
pressed
flat
against
the
wall
presently
the
door
creaked
open
and
i
heard
the
noise
of
breathing
i
followed
it
as
gently
as
a
shadow
halting
sharply
when
i
could
not
hear
it
or
it
grew
too
near
i
was
weaponless--for
i
had
left
belleville's
revolver
in
the
laboratory
ere
for
the
first
time
leaving
it
but
still
i
dared
not
arm
myself
for
to
have
done
so
would
have
given
my
adversaries
sooner
or
later
a
certain
clue
to
my
position
and
my
only
hope
of
worsting
them
now
consisted
in
preserving
my
absolute
invisibility
and
at
the
same
time
knowing
where
in
the
general
sense
they
were
my
first
great
difficulty
arose
in
the
passage
of
the
outer
door
i
dared
not
slip
out
with
them
and
since
they
locked
it
after
them
i
was
forced
to
wait
some
time
before
i
deemed
it
safe
to
open
it
again
thus
when
i
reached
the
outer
passage
there
was
absolutely
nothing
left
to
guide
my
steps
however
i
hurried
to
the
arch
and
thence
looked
forth
along
the
bifurcated
corridor
seeing
and
hearing
nothing
i
sank
to
the
floor
and
like
an
indian
pressed
my
ear
against
the
boards
one
far-off
panel
a
little
later
creaked
distinctly
wood
though
carpeted
is
a
fine
sound
conductor
this
gave
me
the
direction
hot
foot
i
followed
it
but
soon
i
came
to
a
corner
and
beyond
a
short
wide
cul-de-sac
with
three
closed
doors
here
i
stopped
with
straining
ears
and
listened
with
a
beating
heart
and
bated
breath
the
conspirators
were
there
beyond
the
scope
of
doubt
and
presently
i
knew
the
door
they
wished
to
pass
i
saw
the
handle
turn
and
heard
a
sigh
locked
murmured
a
voice
in
english--then
in
arabic
it
breathed
keep
closely
by
me
ptahmes
hold
my
coat
three
sharp
raps
followed
on
the
panels
a
voice
that
thrilled
me
asked
within
the
room
who
is
there
a
voice
the
cleverly
twisted
voice
of
belleville
answered
in
a
sharp
falsetto
from
without
it
is
i
my
dear
young
lady
sir
philip
lang
the
door
was
immediately
opened
and
i
saw
the
sad
face
of
my
sweetheart
sir
philip
she
cried--then
seeing
no
one
she
stopped
dismayed
of
a
sudden
she
uttered
a
shriek
and
fell
back
into
the
room
back
back
clasping
her
hands
to
her
neck
and
struggling
to
cry
out
i
guessed
the
reason
instantly--belleville
had
seized
her
by
the
throat
i
sprang
to
her
assistance
but
paused
again--by
a
miracle
in
time--just
across
the
threshold
miss
ottley--i
shall
not
cannot
call
her
mrs
belleville
though
indeed
she
was--went
spinning
across
the
room
free
i
saw
i
slipped
along
the
wall
beside
the
lintel
and
waited
holding
breath
what
next
the
door
slammed
and
the
bolt
shot
in
answer
to
my
question
then
came
a
long
silence
miss
ottley
stood
beside
the
farthest
wall
supporting
herself
on
the
back
of
a
saddle-bag
chair
a
picture
of
horror
and
fear
personified
i
would
have
given
all
the
world
for
liberty
to
soothe
her
fears
to
take
her
in
my
arms
and
comfort
her
but
it
was
not
to
be
everything
depended
on
my
cunning
and
my
silence
tearing
my
glances
from
her
ashen
face
i
looked
around
the
room
it
was
her
bedroom
the
bed
occupied
one
corner
beside
the
canopy
was
an
open
window
through
which
the
light
streamed
in
striking
full
upon
the
door
against
another
wall
stood
a
duchesse
toilet
table
and
a
huge
bemirrored
clothes
chest
of
carven
ivory
and
ebony
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
thick
pile
carpet
of
dark
crimson
hue
the
window
curtains
were
of
purple
velvet
the
bed's
canopy
of
crimson
silk
the
walls
were
painted
black
and
gold
it
was
indeed
a
mourning
chamber
who
is
it--who
is
it
gasped
the
white-faced
black-robed
mourner
i
glanced
at
her
again
and
saw
that
one
hand
was
pressed
tightly
to
her
side
no
answer
coming
she
repeated
her
demand
with
more
composure
then
a
curious
thing
happened
a
board
creaked
and
looking
swiftly
at
the
floor
i
saw
the
imprint
of
a
foot
marked
in
the
pile
it
vanished
and
the
pile
sprang
up
again
resiliently
but
twenty
inches
farther
onward
towards
the
girl
a
second
sole-shaped
hollow
formed
itself
and
there
remained
an
instant's
flashing
search
disclosed
three
others
i
now
knew
for
certain
the
position
of
my
enemies
and
with
a
wild
heart-throb
of
joy
i
nerved
myself
for
action
the
shape
of
the
footmarks
showed
me
that
both
men
faced
the
girl
and
that
they
were
standing
about
a
yard
apart
with
two
noiseless
strides
i
stepped
behind
the
rearmost
then
i
stooped
and
seized
a
pair
of
hard
lean
thighs
and
heaved
a
body
up
and
sent
it
hurling
through
the
air
above
the
second
set
of
footprints
i've
got
you
again
you
dog
i
cried
then
stepped
back
swift
and
noiseless
to
my
former
place
the
trick
was
perfectly
successful
silent
save
for
their
heavy
breathing
and
the
trembling
of
their
feet
the
rascals
writhed
and
stamped
about
the
room
locked
doubtless
in
a
close
embrace
although
i
could
not
see
them
as
for
me
i
slipped
presently
to
a
chair
caught
it
up
and
guided
by
a
sound
i
brought
it
crashing
down
upon
the
head
of
one
of
them
there
followed
a
heavy
groan
then
a
dagger
blade
flashed
out
of
nothingness
and
once
twice
thrice
it
rose
and
fell
murder
was
being
done
before
my
eyes
but
i
had
only
half
a
mind
to
stay
it
and
indeed
before
i
could
the
knife
had
vanished
into
mist
again
and
all
to
be
seen
was
a
dark
flow
of
scarlet
fluid
that
welled
in
air
and
sank
upon
the
carpet
i
waited
spellbound
which
was
alive--which
was
dead
belleville's
voice
put
the
question

suddenly
well

he
gasped
in
arabic
he
had
me
throttled
when
you
struck
you
shall
have
fifty
pounds
for
this
day's
work
thanks
good
master
i
returned
and
edged
towards
his
voice
but
at
that
moment
miss
ottley
fell
in
a
swoon
and
death
could
hardly
have
availed
to
keep
me
from
her
side
with
a
bound
i
was
across
the
room
and
in
another
second
she
was
in
my
arms
belleville
must
have
seen
but
thinking
me
the
arab
instead
of
chiding
he
commended
me
carry
her
to
the
laboratory
he
commanded
i'll
follow
with
this
carrion
we
must
dispose
of
it
nay
wait
i'll
go
first
damn
him
how
he
bleeds
he
added
in
english
then
a
little
later
he
is
wonderfully
light
for
so
tall
and
strong
a
man
by
then
he
must
have
had
the
arab's
body
in
his
arms
i
heard
heavy
footfalls
stamping
to
the
door
carrying
my
burden
i
followed
them
the
door
opened
and
we
both
passed
out
i
hated
the
thought
of
taking
my
sweetheart
to
that
room
of
horror
but
i
could
not
bear
to
leave
her
where
she
had
been
so
terrified
to
recover
by
herself
and
in
the
next
place
i
did
not
dare
to
let
belleville
even
for
a
moment
out
of
my
reach
he
would
soon
be
bound
to
discover
his
mistake
and
then
the
fight
would
be
renewed
with
the
advantage
all
on
his
side
since
he
was
armed
with
a
weapon
which
it
was
evident
he
could
conceal
till
the
time
came
for
using
it
prudence
demanded
that
i
should
seize
and
disarm
belleville
before
his
suspicions
became
excited
prudence
also
demanded
that
i
should
leave
my
sweetheart
somewhere
on
the
journey
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
do
the
latter
her
face
so
near
to
mine
her
breath
upon
my
lips
that
is
why
i
went
to
the
laboratory
and
why
i
took
her
with
me

belleville's
first
act
after
tossing
the
arab's
corpse
upon
the
floor
and
bolting
the
laboratory
door
was
to
rush
over
to
the
couch
and
remove
therefrom
the
mummy
of
ptahmes
this
he
placed
with
careful
haste
upon
a
marble
slab
and
he
commanded
me
in
arabic
meanwhile
to
carry
the
lady
to
the
couch
i
obeyed
him
in
silence
he
then
ordered
me
to
take
up
the
body
of
the
englishman
pinsent
and
bring
it
to
the
sarcophagus
this
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
arab
i
did
so
and
found
him
quite
dead
belleville's
dagger
had
twice
pierced
his
heart
i
then
raised
the
corpse
and
carried
it
to
the
great
lead
coffin
what
next
master
i
asked
in
guttural
arabic
belleville's
voice
answered
from
behind
me
lift
the
carrion
up
that
is
well
now
let
it
slip
into
the
bath
gently
ptahmes
gently--or
the
stuff
will
splash
here--i
will
help
you
where
i
demanded
i
was
trying
to
locate
him
wait
he
replied--then
here
his
voice
sounded
from
across
the
sarcophagus
a
second
later
his
hand
brushed
one
of
mine
and
passed
i'll
take
the
shoulders
he
said
you
take
the
feet
be
careful
man--gently
gently
it
was
maddening
to
be
so
near
and
yet
so
far
but
there
was
nothing
for
it
except
to
follow
his
directions
i
therefore
grasped
the
corpse
firmly
by
the
ankles
when
the
greater
weight
of
it
had
been
transferred
and
then
i
watched
the
great
blood
clot
upon
its
chest--the
only
visible
sign
of
its
existence--sink
down
down
to
the
liquid
contents
of
the
coffin
soon
it
rested
there
like
a
crimson
lily
on
the
surface
of
a
pond
i
let
my
fingers
loose
their
hold
and
the
unseen
limbs
of
the
corpse
subsided
on
the
liquid
with
an
oily
swish
the
whole
corpse
seemed
to
be
floating
belleville
realised
this
as
soon
as
i
wait
here
he
said
to
me--then
added
in
english
speaking
to
himself
where
the
deuce
did
i
put
that
glass
rod
ah
i
remember
then
i
heard
the
thud
of
his
retreating
steps
and
a
little
later
i
saw
waveringly
approaching
me
from
across
the
room
apparently
of
its
own
volition
a
long
glass
solid
bar
about
four
feet
long
and
an
inch
thick
i
was
overjoyed
at
the
sight
for
my
hands
were
free
belleville
could
not
see
me
and
the
glass
rod
informed
me
exactly
of
his
whereabouts
quick
as
thought
i
slipped
around
the
sarcophagus
and
making
a
little
detour
got
behind
the
murderer
he
went
straight
to
the
coffin
and
plunged
the
rod
within
it
doubtless
he
was
using
it
to
submerge
the
corpse
i
heard
a
hissing
bubbling
sound
and
belleville
saying
watch
me
closely
ptahmes--for
this
is
what
you
must
do
i
crept
upon
him
until
i
could
hear
his
breathing
quite
distinctly
although
he
was
not
greatly
exerting
himself
then
came
the
time
to
act
my
god
he
suddenly
exclaimed--not
pinsent--ptahmes--what's
this
the
glass
rod
was
still
it
stood
bolt
upright
in
the
sarcophagus
and
so
rigidly
motionless
that
i
guessed
belleville's
weight
was
leaning
on
it
i
gave
a
swift
glance
into
the
coffin
and
almost
shrieked
with
surprise
the
liquid
had
made
the
dead
arab
visible
again
and
his
death-mask
grinned
up
at
us
with
a
fixed
and
blood-curdling
stare
on
instant
i
opened
my
arms
wide
and
threw
them
round
my
unseen
enemy
he
uttered
a
howl
of
rage
and
terror
and
turned
within
my
grasp
to
fight
me
biting
and
clawing
like
a
savage
beast
but
very
soon
i
mastered
him
disregarding
his
animal-like
efforts
i
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
beat
his
skull
upon
the
edge
of
the
sarcophagus
until
he
had
quite
ceased
to
struggle
then
anxious
of
all
things
to
make
sure
of
him
by
seeing
him
i
heaved
him
up
and
allowed
him
to
slide
headforemost
down
into
the
bath
beside
the
arab
he
had
murdered
in
mistake
for
me
i
reasoned
that
since
the
liquid
there
had
made
the
arab
visible
it
should
produce
a
like
effect
on
belleville
but
i
was
utterly
unprepared
for
the
result
the
stuff
must
have
been
an
acid
of
tremendous
power
it
awakened
the
senseless
wretch
to
almost
instant
tortured
consciousness
a
series
of
dreadful
shrieks
filled
the
room
with
strange
detonating
echoes
belleville
was
no
sooner
in
the
coffin
than
out
of
it
and
visible
in
part
his
face
and
hands
were
plainly
to
be
seen
they
came
out
white
and
dripping
wet
but
a
few
seconds'
contact
with
the
air
turned
them
red
as
blood
i
seized
the
glass
rod
to
defend
myself
expecting
an
attack
but
there
was
no
need
to
use
it
the
shrieking
wretch
staggered
down
the
room
to
the
first
dispensing
cabinet
he
tore
the
door
open
and
clutched
at
a
big
phial
the
contents
of
which
he
poured
upon
his
hands
and
splashed
upon
his
face
wailing
all
the
while
like
a
lost
soul
in
the
depths
of
hell
happily
he
did
not
keep
this
up
for
long
the
drug
that
he
applied
to
his
hurts
whatever
it
was
must
have
salved
them
for
in
a
moment
or
two
his
heart-rending
outcries
subsided
to
a
deep
low
sobbing
even
that
however
was
more
than
i
could
stand
i
wanted
belleville
dead
but
i
could
not
endure
the
sight
and
sound
of
his
agony--agony
that
i
unwittingly
had
caused
belleville
i
called
out
can
i
help
you
he
gasped
and
caught
his
breath
turning
his
face
towards
me
to
my
surprise
it
was
no
longer
scarlet
it
had
caught
the
hue
of
leather
and
the
eyes
were
mantling
purple
at
the
whites
i
did
not
know
the
stuff
was
acid
i
continued
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
to
soothe
your
suffering
i
shall
and
gladly
you
dog
said
he
you've
ruined
me
and
now
you
are
gloating
over
your
handiwork
with
that
he
put
his
hand
in
his
bosom
and
began
to
steal
in
my
direction
i
remembered
his
concealed
dagger
and
called
out
be
warned
belleville--i
can
see
you
your
dagger
will
not
help
you
oh
oh
oh
he
groaned
and
stopped
short
hugh
pinsent's
voice--oh
heaven
cried
miss
ottley--behind
me
she
had
awakened
from
her
swoon
i
swung
on
heel
and
watched
her
rise
hugh
she
sighed
hugh--where
are
you
dear
then
she
saw
belleville
and
the
hideous
apparition
he
presented
a
black
pain-tortured
face
hovering
in
mid-air
with
two
dark
ghostly
hands
outstretched
before
it
froze
her
blood
mercifully
she
swooned
again
and
fell
back
senseless
on
the
lounge
belleville
recommenced
his
moaning
and
began
walking
up
and
down
wringing
his
hands
i
stood
silent
lost
in
thought
and
wondering
what
i
ought
to
do
belleville
told
me
he
stopped
on
a
sudden
and
called
my
name
twice

here
said
i
i
am
at
your
mercy
now
he
muttered
in
a
broken
voice
i'm
blind
what
i
cried
ay
said
he
and
my
facial
extremities
are
dying
fast--pah
my
nose
is
already
dead
look
he
put
up
one
hand
to
his
face
and
before
my
eyes
broke
off
his
nose
and
tossed
it
on
the
floor
it
snapped
like
a
piece
of
tinder
leaving
a
black
ugly
stump
next
he
plucked
the
dagger
from
his
breast--or
rather
from
where
his
bosom
seemed
to
be--and
cast
it
on
the
floor
i
was
speechless
with
horror
and
surprise
now
that
you
have
naught
to
fear
from
me
he
groaned
if
you
have
a
heart
in
your
breast
you
will
help
to
end
my
pain
anything
anything--only
tell
me
how
i
cried
advancing
towards
him
as
i
spoke
but
hearing
me
approaching
he
shouted
out
for
me
to
stop
don't
come
near
me
he
wailed
don't
touch
me--or
i
shall
try
to
murder
you--i'll
not
be
able
to
prevent
myself--and
i
want
to
undo
some
of
the
ill
i've
done
before
i
die
i
halted
but
what
then
shall
i
do
i
asked
light
the
asbestos
fire
you'll
find
matches
in
the
table
drawer
i
am
perishing
of
cold
that
is
the
only
thing
that
will
soothe
the
anguish
i
am
going
through
oh
be
quick
be
quick
i
flew
to
obey
him
and
in
a
moment
i
had
set
the
stove
ablaze
belleville
found
his
way
to
it
as
if
by
instinct
and
stooping
down
he
pressed
his
awful-looking
face
against
the
bars
groaning
in
a
way
that
made
my
very
flesh
creep
yes--yes
i'm
blind
he
kept
muttering
between
his
moans
and
very
soon
i
shall
be
dead
i
must
atone
i
must
atone
belleville
i
said
at
last--i
forced
myself
to
say
it
for
his
face
had
grown
ink-black
are
you
not
wasting
precious
time
is
there
not
something
i
can
get
to
counteract
the
acid
it
appears
to----
hush
he
interrupted
there
is
nothing
it
is
eating
into
my
brain
besides
i
am
blind
and
do
not
wish
to
live
but
let
me
think
this
pain--i
cannot
use
my
wits--it
dazes
me
ah
now
i
must
i
must
how
can
i
die
with
all--pinsent
pinsent
his
voice
was
a
piercing
scream
yes--yes
i
answered
i
was
shaking
like
a
reed
is
there
not
a
big
jar
of
yellow
spirit
near
the
coffin
somewhere
yes
then
for
god's
sake
lead
me
to
it
i
caught
him
by
the
hand
and
guided
him
forthwith
to
the
jar
take
out
the
stopper
he
entreated
i
did
so
and
thereupon
he
plunged
his
hands
into
the
vessel
and
began
to
lave
his
neck
and
face
sobbing
raucously
the
while
the
odour
of
the
stuff
however
was
so
nauseous
to
me
that
i
stepped
back
in
order
to
escape
it
belleville
seemed
to
know
at
once
pinsent
he
cried
where
are
you
here
said
i
go
and
wake
her
my
wife
he
muttered
suddenly
i
have
something
to
tell
you
both
before
i
go
i
am
dying
fast
i
hastened
to
do
his
bidding
but
before
i
reached
miss
ottley's
side
i
was
arrested
by
a
loud
thudding
crash
turning
swiftly
i
saw
that
belleville
had
overturned
the
jar
its
contents
had
already
flooded
the
floor
he
hovered
over
with
a
lighted
vesta
in
one
of
his
black
hands
what
are
you
doing
i
demanded
he
stooped
floorwards
with
the
match
and
instantly
a
mighty
flame
shot
up
that
licked
the
very
roof
revenge
he
shrieked
revenge
i've
fooled
you
pinsent
fooled
you
now
we
all
shall
die
together
look
with
that
he
steeped
both
hands
in
the
burning
fluid
and
flitting
like
a
salamander
through
the
flames
he
made
for
the
sarcophagus
i
could
not
have
stayed
him
had
i
wished
for
there
was
a
sea
of
fire
between
us
but
in
good
truth
i
was
too
dazed
for
the
while
at
least
to
move
a
muscle
reaching
the
great
lead
tomb
the
dreadful
flaming
object
that
had
once
been
belleville
thrust
his
lambent
hands
into
the
coffin
there
followed
an
explosion
of
appalling
fury
a
mass
of
brilliant
white
combustible
shot
up
with
a
mighty
roar
from
the
sarcophagus
to
the
ceiling
it
pierced
the
padded
lining
like
a
thunderbolt
and
flashed
into
the
room
above
but
on
its
impact
with
the
ceiling
it
also
splashed
a
rain
of
fire
about
the
great
laboratory
in
two
seconds
the
whole
place
ran
with
flames
by
a
miracle
i
was
not
touched
but
it
was
not
so
with
miss
ottley
her
skirt
was
ablaze
i
rushed
forward
and
tore
the
thing
off
in
strips
before
it
burnt
her--then
seizing
her
in
my
arms
i
made
like
a
madman
to
the
door
a
hideous
burning
object
lay
before
it
shrieking
sulphurous
curses
it
was
belleville
but
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
strength
and
he
could
not
stay
me
the
catch
yielded
to
my
hand
and
i
dashed
into
the
passage
half
blinded
with
fire
and
smoke
but
safe
i
did
not
rest
until
i
had
reached
the
staircase
miss
ottley
was
then
awake
she
struggled
in
my
arms
so
i
set
her
down
and
faced
her
but
she
did
not
see
me
her
dress
was
smouldering
in
places
she
seemed
utterly
bewildered
a
woman
ran
up
to
her
and
began
to
put
out
the
burning
patches
with
her
hands
the
house
was
in
an
uproar
servants--they
were
all
either
arabs
or
nubians--ran
hither
and
thither
shouting
and
screaming
in
a
panic
the
woman
evidently
a
nurse
who
attended
to
miss
ottley
was
the
only
white
person
to
be
seen
she
was
evidently
terrified
but
she
did
not
lose
her
head
she
kept
asking
miss
ottley
in
french
to
explain
what
had
happened
nobody
seemed
aware
that
the
house
was
on
fire
they
had
all
been
merely
alarmed
by
the
noises
they
had
heard
miss
ottley
in
the
middle
of
it
all
began
to
weep
she
was
thoroughly
upset
and
ill
and
i
perceived
at
once
that
she
was
on
the
verge
of
a
mental
and
physical
collapse
in
the
circumstances
i
judged
it
best
to
remain
a
silent
onlooker
of
events
and
not
to
take
any
action
unless
there
arose
a
real
necessity
it
was
plain
that
i
was
still
invisible
and
as
for
the
house
being
on
fire
i
deemed
it
utterly
desirable
that
it
should
burn
down
to
the
last
shaving
and
thus
fittingly
entomb
in
its
destruction
the
ghastly
tragedy
of
the
laboratory
the
issue
tallied
largely
with
my
wishes
the
fire
was
seen
first
from
the
street
there
followed
a
veritable
pandemonium
the
coloured
servants
fled
like
cowards
for
their
lives
and
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
the
house
was
in
the
hands
of
firemen
and
police
miss
ottley
was
taken
by
the
nurse
out
into
the
street
and
there
questioned
by
a
sergeant
but
she
was
quite
unable
to
answer
his
insistent
queries
satisfactorily
all
she
could
say
was
that
she
had
been
a
long
time
ill
she
had
fainted
in
her
room
that
afternoon
and
dr
belleville
or
someone
had
carried
her
to
the
laboratory
when
she
woke
up
she
had
heard
a
frightful
noise
she
supposed
it
was
one
of
the
doctor's
experiments
she
thought
she
had
fainted
again
but
she
remembered
nothing
more
until
she
found
herself
with
her
dress
on
fire
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
she
could
not
explain
how
she
got
there
the
sergeant
was
civil
enough
to
her
but
the
fool
in
his
fussy
officiousness
overlooked
her
weak
condition
and
the
girl
broke
down
and
utterly
collapsed
before
he
realised
his
quite
unnecessary
cruelty
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
french
nurse
had
disappeared
during
the
colloquy
there
was
therefore
no
woman
at
hand
to
attend
to
my
poor
sweetheart
fortunately
however
a
physician
appeared
opportunely
on
the
scene
and
at
his
direction
she
was
immediately
conveyed
to
a
hospital
after
she
had
gone
i
did
not
tarry
very
long
choosing
a
place
where
the
cordoned
crowd
was
thinnest
i
slipped
back
through
the
park
railings
over
which
i
climbed
and
dropped
into
the
park
feeling
the
weight
of
my
invisibility
acutely
from
this
vantage
point
i
watched
the
conflagration
for
a
while
the
house
was
manifestly
doomed
indeed
the
efforts
of
the
firemen
were
entirely
directed
to
save
adjoining
buildings
a
hundred
jets
of
water
played
upon
the
walls
of
these
in
thin
continuous
streams
men
about
me
were
talking
the
matter
over
as
if
it
personally
appealed
to
them
they
mostly
viewed
it
with
a
sort
of
half-secret
satisfaction
the
misfortunes
of
millionaires
do
not
excite
much
sympathy
in
the
hearts
of
the
mob
one
man
glibly
quoted
lay
not
up
unto
yourselves
treasures
in
this
world
on
the
occasion
of
a
grimy
fireman
bringing
out
a
magnificent
but
half-destroyed
silver-framed
canvas
of
velasquez
but
the
crowd
cheered
the
fireman
for
his
pluck
all
the
same
at
length
i
realised
that
i
was
very
tired
and
hungry
too
so
i
slunk
off
and
made
my
way
to
dixon
hubbard's
rooms
they
were
locked
of
course
and
i
had
not
the
key
i
had
left
it
with
the
porter
of
the
building
but
i
could
not
go
to
him
and
ask
him
to
give
it
up
to
an
apparently
fleshless
voice
wondering
what
to
do
i
crept
into
the
passage
sat
down
in
a
corner
underneath
the
stairs
and
waited
for
an
inspiration
waiting
there
i
fell
asleep
chapter
xxx
the
last
i
awoke
in
the
grey
light
of
dawn
stiff
with
cold
and
aching
in
every
limb
arising
i
left
my
hiding-place
and
went
into
the
vestibule
the
night
porter
sat
on
a
stool
in
his
little
office
toasting
his
toes
before
the
stove
and
reading
one
of
the
morning
papers
i
stepped
up
to
the
door
at
once
hearing
my
footsteps
he
looked
around
good-morning
michael
i
said
as
well
as
my
chattering
teeth
would
let
me
do
you
want
all
that
fire
i
had
forgotten
that
i
was
completely
invisible
the
fellow
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
start
and
stared
at
me
aghast
what's
the
matter
with
you
i
demanded
testily
'ere--you
keep
off
i've
done
nothing
to
'arm
you
he
whined
and
he
backed
before
my
advance
against
the
wall
of
the
office
the
very
picture
of
abject
terror
his
appearance
recalled
me
to
my
senses
but
it
was
too
late
to
cry
over
spilt
milk
i
thought
it
better
to
make
a
confidant
of
the
man
if
he
would
let
me
don't
be
frightened
michael
there
is
no
need
i'm
not
a
ghost
feel
my
hands
i
said
but
panic
seized
the
fellow
he
uttered
a
wild
shriek
and
fled
for
his
life
into
the
passage
i
could
hardly
help
laughing
but
i
saw
a
chance
in
the
contretemps
to
end
my
immediate
difficulty--so
i
went
straight
to
the
desk
and
fortunately
found
it
open
in
hubbard's
pigeon-hole
was
the
key
i
wanted
i
took
it
out
caught
up
a
times
and
hurried
up
the
stairs
in
another
moment
i
was
safe
in
hubbard's
room
with
the
door
locked
against
intrusion
my
first
care
was
to
set
the
asbestos
ablaze
and
warm
myself
then
i
opened
the
paper
and
found
at
once
the
news
i
sought
under
great
cross
headlines
in
the
main
sheet
miss
ottley's
house
had
been
completely
gutted
by
fire
some
of
the
walls
still
stood
but
with
the
exception
of
a
few
pictures
the
whole
of
the
valuable
art
furniture
and
the
late
sir
robert
ottley's
splendid
collection
of
egyptian
coins
manuscripts
and
curios
had
been
destroyed
it
was
supposed
that
dr
belleville
had
perished
in
the
flames
but
no
sign
of
his
remains
had
been
discovered
the
fire
as
far
as
it
was
possible
to
ascertain
had
arisen
from
an
accident
due
to
the
unsuccessful
conduct
of
a
chemical
experiment
it
was
well
known
in
scientific
circles
said
the
journal
that
the
doctor
had
been
engaged
in
a
series
of
experiments
the
object
of
which
had
been
kept
a
close
secret
but
a
city
firm
of
manufacturing
chemists
had
recently
supplied
him
with
large
quantities
of
a
certain
highly
inflammable
liquid
compound
possessing
radio
activities
which
had
been
prepared
at
enormous
cost
under
his
directions
the
manager
of
the
firm
on
being
interviewed
stated
that
in
his
opinion
this
compound
was
principally
responsible
for
the
tragic
disaster
there
was
always
a
danger
in
handling
it
of
spontaneous
combustion
it
appeared
and
if
it
once
took
fire
by
no
means
could
it
be
extinguished
except
by
the
shutting
off
of
all
supplies
of
oxygen
failing
this
it
would
burn
to
the
last
with
the
most
explosive
energy
according
to
miss
ottley's
statement
when
first
interrogated
by
an
officer
from
scotland
yard
she
had
been
in
the
laboratory
with
dr
belleville
at
the
time
of
the
catastrophe
she
had
lately
been
very
ill
and
it
seems
she
had
fainted
it
was
extremely
probable
that
the
doctor
in
his
anxiety
to
revive
her
had
neglected
his
usual
caution
and
had
done
some
careless
thing
which
had
led
to
his
destruction
probably
he
had
been
killed
outright
by
the
first
explosion
it
was
however
a
matter
of
general
relief
that
miss
ottley
had
managed
to
escape
and
that
there
had
been
no
further
sacrifice
of
life
everyone
would
sympathise
with
the
unfortunate
young
lady
in
her
sad
position
only
a
few
weeks
ago
the
gallant
young
officer
to
whom
she
had
been
engaged
to
be
married
had
come
to
an
untimely
end
in
a
railway
accident
on
the
very
eve
of
his
wedding
day
then
a
little
later
the
dark
angel
had
deprived
her
of
a
loving
and
beloved
father
the
great
millionaire
archã¦ologist
whose
recent
operations
on
'change
had
startled
the
world
and
made
of
him
the
richest
man
in
the
united
kingdom
and
now
she
had
lost
by
death
the
kind
and
learned
guardian
to
whom
her
late
father
had
entrusted
her
future
and
the
management
of
her
enormous
fortune
nobody
would
be
surprised
to
learn
that
this
great
accumulation
of
calamities
had
reduced
the
fate-stricken
young
lady
to
a
state
of
utter
physical
prostration
she
had
been
taken
yesterday
evening
after
her
rescue
from
the
burning
mansion
to
the
albert
hospital
but
she
had
subsequently
been
removed
to
the
walsingham
hotel
where
the
management
had
placed
a
suite
of
rooms
at
her
disposal
she
was
there
being
treated
under
the
care
of
drs
fiaschi
and
mason
the
well-known
heart
and
nerve
specialists
these
gentlemen
express
themselves
hopeful
of
her
ultimate
recovery
but
they
do
not
conceal
the
fact
that
she
is
at
present
in
a
very
low
condition
and
it
is
significant
that
the
road
in
front
of
the
hotel
was
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
thickly
overspread
with
tan
this
last
paragraph
as
may
easily
be
conceived
filled
me
with
anxiety
i
resolved
to
go
at
once
to
the
walsingham
hotel
and
find
out
exactly
how
she
was
for
myself
but
fortunately
in
moving
towards
the
door
to
put
my
purpose
into
execution
i
had
to
pass
the
mirror-backed
door
of
a
clothes
press
i
did
not
pass
it
then
i
stopped
spellbound
i
was
no
longer
invisible
that
is
to
say
my
face
and
hands
were
not--although
my
body
was
the
mirror
showed
me
a
head
floating
apparently
in
mid-air
and
a
pair
of
hands
hanging
mysteriously
from
nothing
my
eyes
were
curiously
goggled
with
a
thin
gelatinous-like
film
with
a
glassy
surface
that
was
bound
about
my
head
this
i
tore
off
forthwith
and
curiously
examined
it
was
actually
composed
of
gelatine
tossing
it
aside
i
ran
my
fingers
over
my
clothing
and
discovered
from
the
sense
of
touch
that
i
was
clad
to
the
neck
in
one
unbroken
combination
suit
of
rubber
overalls
which
included
footgear
i
soon
made
out
the
secret
of
its
fastening
and
tearing
it
open
i
stepped
forth
into
the
light
of
day
and
perfect
visibility
to
find
that
i
still
had
on
all
the
clothes
i
had
worn
when
dr
belleville
trapped
me
except
my
boots
the
overalls
however
remained
visible
or
rather
partially
so
for
their
inner
surface
viewed
from
the
opening
was
discernible
i
put
them
carefully
aside
for
future
investigation
and
proceeded
to
make
a
toilet
my
first
care
was
a
hot
bath
the
hall
porter
whom
i
had
frightened
so
desperately
a
little
while
before
answered
my
ring
he
was
astounded
to
see
me
but
i
did
not
choose
to
make
him
any
explanations
and
he
was
too
overcome
to
ask
me
for
any
a
little
later
i
was
luxuriating
in
a
steaming
bath
which
removed
the
last
vestige
of
my
parisian
disguise
most
of
the
paint
however
had
worn
off
before
so
it
was
the
easier
to
become
myself
again
but
not
quite
my
old
familiar
self
my
experiences
had
permanently
aged
me
there
were
lines
upon
my
face
that
i
was
stranger
to
and
with
which
i
made
reluctant
acquaintance
and
my
hair
was
liberally
streaked
with
grey
i
had
put
on
ten
years
at
least
i
felt
old
too
that
was
the
worst
of
it--old
ill
and
thick-blooded
and
infinitely
world-weary
i
felt
a
hunger
for
the
desert
and
big
open
spaces
a
need
to
hasten
from
the
grinding
selfish
life
of
cities
with
their
secret
crimes
and
gilded
vices
and
dull-herded
groping
after
sordid
happiness
but
i
did
not
wish
to
go
alone
at
a
little
after
eight
o'clock
i
entered
the
walsingham
and
demanded
to
see
miss
ottley's
head
nurse
she
was
at
breakfast
but
the
waiter
told
me
that
miss
ottley
had
spent
a
good
night
and
was
still
asleep
so
i
was
content
to
wait
afterwards
i
had
to
lie
to
the
nurse
in
order
to
be
permitted
to
see
the
invalid
i
told
her
that
i
was
miss
ottley's
nearest
living
relative
and
i
suppressed
the
fact
of
my
medical
qualifications
the
woman
otherwise
would
have
referred
me
to
the
physicians
who
had
employed
her
and
i
should
have
been
put
off
for
hours
as
it
was
it
required
all
my
powers
of
persuasion
to
induce
her
to
admit
me
to
the
sick
room
but
i
prevailed
on
her
at
last
with
a
show
of
stern
authority
and
a
curt
intimation
that
her
position
depended
on
my
complaisance
the
falsehood
is
not
one
that
i
feel
any
shame
at
for
i
knew
what
an
effect
my
appearance
would
make
in
the
patient
and
i
was
determined
at
all
costs
to
be
with
her
at
the
moment
of
her
waking
i
shall
pass
over
the
preliminary
period
that
i
spent
beside
her
bed
it
is
too
full
of
sorrow
to
recall
with
anything
but
misery
the
poor
girl
was
as
frail
and
wan
as
any
spirit
they
had
cut
off
all
her
glorious
hair
and
the
hand
i
kissed
which
lay
so
weakly
on
the
coverlid
was
whiter
than
a
snowflake
and
almost
as
destitute
of
vigour
she
slept
as
gently
as
a
weary
babe
and
it
was
hard
at
first
to
believe
thoroughly
she
lived
but
at
length
she
sighed
and
her
great
eyes
slowly
opened
and
looked
up
questioningly
into
mine
she
thought
that
she
was
dead
and
that
my
ghost
had
sought
her
out
hugh
she
whispered
and
a
soft
smile
lighted
her
face
and
made
it
infinitely
lovely
though
so
wan
i
knew
that
i
should
find
you
dear
she
sighed
and
so
i
could
not
help
but
pray
to
die
will
god
punish
us
for
that
but
i
kissed
her
on
the
lips--the
first
long
kiss
of
love
that
i
had
known--or
she--and
she
came
back
warm
with
quickened
hope
and
will
to
live
within
my
arms
and
all
was
well
with
us
there
is
little
more
to
tell
as
soon
as
she
was
strong
again
we
married
quietly
and
now
we
live
in
a
place
where
crowded
cities
are
unknown--far
from
old
england's
shores
i
never
again
saw
belleville's
arab
servant
who
so
marvellously
resembled
the
old
high
priest
of
amen-ra
nor
his
companion
the
nubian
uromi
they
disappeared
after
the
fire
and
not
all
the
efforts
of
the
police
could
trace
their
hiding-place
the
invisible
suit
of
overalls
is
still
in
my
possession--but
it
had
lost
its
old
mysterious
properties
and
although
i
expended
months
of
patient
labour
to
explore
its
secret
it
was
all
in
vain
to
this
day
i
cannot
tell
who
released
me
from
the
chair
in
which
belleville
had
bound
me
in
the
murderer's
laboratory
and
i
am
still
unable
to
explain
the
many
other
little
mysteries
that
so
involved
us
in
the
period
of
our
contention
with
the
wretch
the
fatal
termination
of
whose
wicked
scheming
i
have
set
forth
in
these
pages
the
greater
part
of
sir
robert
ottley's
fortune
has
been
given
to
the
poor
the
rest
we
settled
on
my
wife's
sole
living
blood
relation
the
old
bed-ridden
aunt
whom
she
has
never
seen
we
both
felt
that
we
should
be
doing
well
to
dispose
of
riches
that--to
an
extent
at
least--must
have
been
acquired
by
arts
of
sinister
significance
still
we
have
never
wanted
and
we
are
not
likely
to
my
profession
yields
us
a
comfortable
living
in
these
grand
but
sparsely
settled
wilds
and
although
we
sometimes
think
regretfully
upon
the
delight
we
once
experienced
in
searching
out
the
lettered
past
of
long-dead
centuries
we
have
other
interests
now
to
fill
our
lives
and
banish
vain
regrets
we
have
our
growing
children
to
attend
to
and
provide
for
we
are
of
real
service
to
the
people
who
surround
us
for
my
wife
is
the
schoolmistress
of
the
district
and
i
am
the
only
surgeon
in
a
radius
of
one
hundred
miles
then
we
have
our
books
and
our
long
evenings
together
in
the
splendid
twilight
of
the
endless
plains
we
have
given
up
the
past
for
the
future
and
we
are
happy
in
our
labour
and
our
love
the
end
