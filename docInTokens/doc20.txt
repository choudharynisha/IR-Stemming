the
idea
that
the
extraordinary
narrative
which
has
been
called
the
joyce-armstrong
fragment
is
an
elaborate
practical
joke
evolved
by
some
unknown
person
cursed
by
a
perverted
and
sinister
sense
of
humour
has
now
been
abandoned
by
all
who
have
examined
the
matter
the
most
macabre
and
imaginative
of
plotters
would
hesitate
before
linking
his
morbid
fancies
with
the
unquestioned
and
tragic
facts
which
reinforce
the
statement
though
the
assertions
contained
in
it
are
amazing
and
even
monstrous
it
is
none
the
less
forcing
itself
upon
the
general
intelligence
that
they
are
true
and
that
we
must
readjust
our
ideas
to
the
new
situation
this
world
of
ours
appears
to
be
separated
by
a
slight
and
precarious
margin
of
safety
from
a
most
singular
and
unexpected
danger
i
will
endeavour
in
this
narrative
which
reproduces
the
original
document
in
its
necessarily
somewhat
fragmentary
form
to
lay
before
the
reader
the
whole
of
the
facts
up
to
date
prefacing
my
statement
by
saying
that
if
there
be
any
who
doubt
the
narrative
of
joyce-armstrong
there
can
be
no
question
at
all
as
to
the
facts
concerning
lieutenant
myrtle
r
n
and
mr
hay
connor
who
undoubtedly
met
their
end
in
the
manner
described
the
joyce-armstrong
fragment
was
found
in
the
field
which
is
called
lower
haycock
lying
one
mile
to
the
westward
of
the
village
of
withyham
upon
the
kent
and
sussex
border
it
was
on
the
15th
september
last
that
an
agricultural
labourer
james
flynn
in
the
employment
of
mathew
dodd
farmer
of
the
chauntry
farm
withyham
perceived
a
briar
pipe
lying
near
the
footpath
which
skirts
the
hedge
in
lower
haycock
a
few
paces
farther
on
he
picked
up
a
pair
of
broken
binocular
glasses
finally
among
some
nettles
in
the
ditch
he
caught
sight
of
a
flat
canvas-backed
book
which
proved
to
be
a
note-book
with
detachable
leaves
some
of
which
had
come
loose
and
were
fluttering
along
the
base
of
the
hedge
these
he
collected
but
some
including
the
first
were
never
recovered
and
leave
a
deplorable
hiatus
in
this
all-important
statement
the
note-book
was
taken
by
the
labourer
to
his
master
who
in
turn
showed
it
to
dr
j
h
atherton
of
hartfield
this
gentleman
at
once
recognized
the
need
for
an
expert
examination
and
the
manuscript
was
forwarded
to
the
aero
club
in
london
where
it
now
lies
the
first
two
pages
of
the
manuscript
are
missing
there
is
also
one
torn
away
at
the
end
of
the
narrative
though
none
of
these
affect
the
general
coherence
of
the
story
it
is
conjectured
that
the
missing
opening
is
concerned
with
the
record
of
mr
joyce-armstrong's
qualifications
as
an
aeronaut
which
can
be
gathered
from
other
sources
and
are
admitted
to
be
unsurpassed
among
the
air-pilots
of
england
for
many
years
he
has
been
looked
upon
as
among
the
most
daring
and
the
most
intellectual
of
flying
men
a
combination
which
has
enabled
him
to
both
invent
and
test
several
new
devices
including
the
common
gyroscopic
attachment
which
is
known
by
his
name
the
main
body
of
the
manuscript
is
written
neatly
in
ink
but
the
last
few
lines
are
in
pencil
and
are
so
ragged
as
to
be
hardly
legible--exactly
in
fact
as
they
might
be
expected
to
appear
if
they
were
scribbled
off
hurriedly
from
the
seat
of
a
moving
aeroplane
there
are
it
may
be
added
several
stains
both
on
the
last
page
and
on
the
outside
cover
which
have
been
pronounced
by
the
home
office
experts
to
be
blood--probably
human
and
certainly
mammalian
the
fact
that
something
closely
resembling
the
organism
of
malaria
was
discovered
in
this
blood
and
that
joyce-armstrong
is
known
to
have
suffered
from
intermittent
fever
is
a
remarkable
example
of
the
new
weapons
which
modern
science
has
placed
in
the
hands
of
our
detectives
and
now
a
word
as
to
the
personality
of
the
author
of
this
epoch-making
statement
joyce-armstrong
according
to
the
few
friends
who
really
knew
something
of
the
man
was
a
poet
and
a
dreamer
as
well
as
a
mechanic
and
an
inventor
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
wealth
much
of
which
he
had
spent
in
the
pursuit
of
his
aeronautical
hobby
he
had
four
private
aeroplanes
in
his
hangars
near
devizes
and
is
said
to
have
made
no
fewer
than
one
hundred
and
seventy
ascents
in
the
course
of
last
year
he
was
a
retiring
man
with
dark
moods
in
which
he
would
avoid
the
society
of
his
fellows
captain
dangerfield
who
knew
him
better
than
anyone
says
that
there
were
times
when
his
eccentricity
threatened
to
develop
into
something
more
serious
his
habit
of
carrying
a
shot-gun
with
him
in
his
aeroplane
was
one
manifestation
of
it
another
was
the
morbid
effect
which
the
fall
of
lieutenant
myrtle
had
upon
his
mind
myrtle
who
was
attempting
the
height
record
fell
from
an
altitude
of
something
over
thirty
thousand
feet
horrible
to
narrate
his
head
was
entirely
obliterated
though
his
body
and
limbs
preserved
their
configuration
at
every
gathering
of
airmen
joyce-armstrong
according
to
dangerfield
would
ask
with
an
enigmatic
smile
and
where
pray
is
myrtle's
head
on
another
occasion
after
dinner
at
the
mess
of
the
flying
school
on
salisbury
plain
he
started
a
debate
as
to
what
will
be
the
most
permanent
danger
which
airmen
will
have
to
encounter
having
listened
to
successive
opinions
as
to
air-pockets
faulty
construction
and
over-banking
he
ended
by
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
refusing
to
put
forward
his
own
views
though
he
gave
the
impression
that
they
differed
from
any
advanced
by
his
companions
it
is
worth
remarking
that
after
his
own
complete
disappearance
it
was
found
that
his
private
affairs
were
arranged
with
a
precision
which
may
show
that
he
had
a
strong
premonition
of
disaster
with
these
essential
explanations
i
will
now
give
the
narrative
exactly
as
it
stands
beginning
at
page
three
of
the
blood-soaked
note-book
nevertheless
when
i
dined
at
rheims
with
coselli
and
gustav
raymond
i
found
that
neither
of
them
was
aware
of
any
particular
danger
in
the
higher
layers
of
the
atmosphere
i
did
not
actually
say
what
was
in
my
thoughts
but
i
got
so
near
to
it
that
if
they
had
any
corresponding
idea
they
could
not
have
failed
to
express
it
but
then
they
are
two
empty
vainglorious
fellows
with
no
thought
beyond
seeing
their
silly
names
in
the
newspaper
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
neither
of
them
had
ever
been
much
beyond
the
twenty-thousand-foot
level
of
course
men
have
been
higher
than
this
both
in
balloons
and
in
the
ascent
of
mountains
it
must
be
well
above
that
point
that
the
aeroplane
enters
the
danger
zone--always
presuming
that
my
premonitions
are
correct
aeroplaning
has
been
with
us
now
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
one
might
well
ask
why
should
this
peril
be
only
revealing
itself
in
our
day
the
answer
is
obvious
in
the
old
days
of
weak
engines
when
a
hundred
horse-power
gnome
or
green
was
considered
ample
for
every
need
the
flights
were
very
restricted
now
that
three
hundred
horse-power
is
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
visits
to
the
upper
layers
have
become
easier
and
more
common
some
of
us
can
remember
how
in
our
youth
garros
made
a
world-wide
reputation
by
attaining
nineteen
thousand
feet
and
it
was
considered
a
remarkable
achievement
to
fly
over
the
alps
our
standard
now
has
been
immeasurably
raised
and
there
are
twenty
high
flights
for
one
in
former
years
many
of
them
have
been
undertaken
with
impunity
the
thirty-thousand-foot
level
has
been
reached
time
after
time
with
no
discomfort
beyond
cold
and
asthma
what
does
this
prove
a
visitor
might
descend
upon
this
planet
a
thousand
times
and
never
see
a
tiger
yet
tigers
exist
and
if
he
chanced
to
come
down
into
a
jungle
he
might
be
devoured
there
are
jungles
of
the
upper
air
and
there
are
worse
things
than
tigers
which
inhabit
them
i
believe
in
time
they
will
map
these
jungles
accurately
out
even
at
the
present
moment
i
could
name
two
of
them
one
of
them
lies
over
the
pau-biarritz
district
of
france
another
is
just
over
my
head
as
i
write
here
in
my
house
in
wiltshire
i
rather
think
there
is
a
third
in
the
homburg-wiesbaden
district
it
was
the
disappearance
of
the
airmen
that
first
set
me
thinking
of
course
everyone
said
that
they
had
fallen
into
the
sea
but
that
did
not
satisfy
me
at
all
first
there
was
verrier
in
france
his
machine
was
found
near
bayonne
but
they
never
got
his
body
there
was
the
case
of
baxter
also
who
vanished
though
his
engine
and
some
of
the
iron
fixings
were
found
in
a
wood
in
leicestershire
in
that
case
dr
middleton
of
amesbury
who
was
watching
the
flight
with
a
telescope
declares
that
just
before
the
clouds
obscured
the
view
he
saw
the
machine
which
was
at
an
enormous
height
suddenly
rise
perpendicularly
upwards
in
a
succession
of
jerks
in
a
manner
that
he
would
have
thought
to
be
impossible
that
was
the
last
seen
of
baxter
there
was
a
correspondence
in
the
papers
but
it
never
led
to
anything
there
were
several
other
similar
cases
and
then
there
was
the
death
of
hay
connor
what
a
cackle
there
was
about
an
unsolved
mystery
of
the
air
and
what
columns
in
the
halfpenny
papers
and
yet
how
little
was
ever
done
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
business
he
came
down
in
a
tremendous
vol-plane
from
an
unknown
height
he
never
got
off
his
machine
and
died
in
his
pilot's
seat
died
of
what
'heart
disease'
said
the
doctors
rubbish
hay
connor's
heart
was
as
sound
as
mine
is
what
did
venables
say
venables
was
the
only
man
who
was
at
his
side
when
he
died
he
said
that
he
was
shivering
and
looked
like
a
man
who
had
been
badly
scared
'died
of
fright'
said
venables
but
could
not
imagine
what
he
was
frightened
about
only
said
one
word
to
venables
which
sounded
like
'monstrous'
they
could
make
nothing
of
that
at
the
inquest
but
i
could
make
something
of
it
monsters
that
was
the
last
word
of
poor
harry
hay
connor
and
he
did
die
of
fright
just
as
venables
thought
and
then
there
was
myrtle's
head
do
you
really
believe--does
anybody
really
believe--that
a
man's
head
could
be
driven
clean
into
his
body
by
the
force
of
a
fall
well
perhaps
it
may
be
possible
but
i
for
one
have
never
believed
that
it
was
so
with
myrtle
and
the
grease
upon
his
clothes--'all
slimy
with
grease'
said
somebody
at
the
inquest
queer
that
nobody
got
thinking
after
that
i
did--but
then
i
had
been
thinking
for
a
good
long
time
i've
made
three
ascents--how
dangerfield
used
to
chaff
me
about
my
shot-gun--but
i've
never
been
high
enough
now
with
this
new
light
paul
veroner
machine
and
its
one
hundred
and
seventy-five
robur
i
should
easily
touch
the
thirty
thousand
tomorrow
i'll
have
a
shot
at
the
record
maybe
i
shall
have
a
shot
at
something
else
as
well
of
course
it's
dangerous
if
a
fellow
wants
to
avoid
danger
he
had
best
keep
out
of
flying
altogether
and
subside
finally
into
flannel
slippers
and
a
dressing-gown
but
i'll
visit
the
air-jungle
tomorrow--and
if
there's
anything
there
i
shall
know
it
if
i
return
i'll
find
myself
a
bit
of
a
celebrity
if
i
don't
this
note-book
may
explain
what
i
am
trying
to
do
and
how
i
lost
my
life
in
doing
it
but
no
drivel
about
accidents
or
mysteries
if
you
please
i
chose
my
paul
veroner
monoplane
for
the
job
there's
nothing
like
a
monoplane
when
real
work
is
to
be
done
beaumont
found
that
out
in
very
early
days
for
one
thing
it
doesn't
mind
damp
and
the
weather
looks
as
if
we
should
be
in
the
clouds
all
the
time
it's
a
bonny
little
model
and
answers
my
hand
like
a
tender-mouthed
horse
the
engine
is
a
ten-cylinder
rotary
robur
working
up
to
one
hundred
and
seventy-five
it
has
all
the
modern
improvements--enclosed
fuselage
high-curved
landing
skids
brakes
gyroscopic
steadiers
and
three
speeds
worked
by
an
alteration
of
the
angle
of
the
planes
upon
the
venetian-blind
principle
i
took
a
shot-gun
with
me
and
a
dozen
cartridges
filled
with
buck-shot
you
should
have
seen
the
face
of
perkins
my
old
mechanic
when
i
directed
him
to
put
them
in
i
was
dressed
like
an
arctic
explorer
with
two
jerseys
under
my
overalls
thick
socks
inside
my
padded
boots
a
storm-cap
with
flaps
and
my
talc
goggles
it
was
stifling
outside
the
hangars
but
i
was
going
for
the
summit
of
the
himalayas
and
had
to
dress
for
the
part
perkins
knew
there
was
something
on
and
implored
me
to
take
him
with
me
perhaps
i
should
if
i
were
using
the
biplane
but
a
monoplane
is
a
one-man
show--if
you
want
to
get
the
last
foot
of
life
out
of
it
of
course
i
took
an
oxygen
bag
the
man
who
goes
for
the
altitude
record
without
one
will
either
be
frozen
or
smothered--or
both
i
had
a
good
look
at
the
planes
the
rudder-bar
and
the
elevating
lever
before
i
got
in
everything
was
in
order
so
far
as
i
could
see
then
i
switched
on
my
engine
and
found
that
she
was
running
sweetly
when
they
let
her
go
she
rose
almost
at
once
upon
the
lowest
speed
i
circled
my
home
field
once
or
twice
just
to
warm
her
up
and
then
with
a
wave
to
perkins
and
the
others
i
flattened
out
my
planes
and
put
her
on
her
highest
she
skimmed
like
a
swallow
down
wind
for
eight
or
ten
miles
until
i
turned
her
nose
up
a
little
and
she
began
to
climb
in
a
great
spiral
for
the
cloud-bank
above
me
it's
all-important
to
rise
slowly
and
adapt
yourself
to
the
pressure
as
you
go
it
was
a
close
warm
day
for
an
english
september
and
there
was
the
hush
and
heaviness
of
impending
rain
now
and
then
there
came
sudden
puffs
of
wind
from
the
south-west--one
of
them
so
gusty
and
unexpected
that
it
caught
me
napping
and
turned
me
half-round
for
an
instant
i
remember
the
time
when
gusts
and
whirls
and
air-pockets
used
to
be
things
of
danger--before
we
learned
to
put
an
overmastering
power
into
our
engines
just
as
i
reached
the
cloud-banks
with
the
altimeter
marking
three
thousand
down
came
the
rain
my
word
how
it
poured
it
drummed
upon
my
wings
and
lashed
against
my
face
blurring
my
glasses
so
that
i
could
hardly
see
i
got
down
on
to
a
low
speed
for
it
was
painful
to
travel
against
it
as
i
got
higher
it
became
hail
and
i
had
to
turn
tail
to
it
one
of
my
cylinders
was
out
of
action--a
dirty
plug
i
should
imagine
but
still
i
was
rising
steadily
with
plenty
of
power
after
a
bit
the
trouble
passed
whatever
it
was
and
i
heard
the
full
deep-throated
purr--the
ten
singing
as
one
that's
where
the
beauty
of
our
modern
silencers
comes
in
we
can
at
last
control
our
engines
by
ear
how
they
squeal
and
squeak
and
sob
when
they
are
in
trouble
all
those
cries
for
help
were
wasted
in
the
old
days
when
every
sound
was
swallowed
up
by
the
monstrous
racket
of
the
machine
if
only
the
early
aviators
could
come
back
to
see
the
beauty
and
perfection
of
the
mechanism
which
have
been
bought
at
the
cost
of
their
lives
about
nine-thirty
i
was
nearing
the
clouds
down
below
me
all
blurred
and
shadowed
with
rain
lay
the
vast
expanse
of
salisbury
plain
half
a
dozen
flying
machines
were
doing
hackwork
at
the
thousand-foot
level
looking
like
little
black
swallows
against
the
green
background
i
dare
say
they
were
wondering
what
i
was
doing
up
in
cloud-land
suddenly
a
grey
curtain
drew
across
beneath
me
and
the
wet
folds
of
vapours
were
swirling
round
my
face
it
was
clammily
cold
and
miserable
but
i
was
above
the
hail-storm
and
that
was
something
gained
the
cloud
was
as
dark
and
thick
as
a
london
fog
in
my
anxiety
to
get
clear
i
cocked
her
nose
up
until
the
automatic
alarm-bell
rang
and
i
actually
began
to
slide
backwards
my
sopped
and
dripping
wings
had
made
me
heavier
than
i
thought
but
presently
i
was
in
lighter
cloud
and
soon
had
cleared
the
first
layer
there
was
a
second--opal-coloured
and
fleecy--at
a
great
height
above
my
head
a
white
unbroken
ceiling
above
and
a
dark
unbroken
floor
below
with
the
monoplane
labouring
upwards
upon
a
vast
spiral
between
them
it
is
deadly
lonely
in
these
cloud-spaces
once
a
great
flight
of
some
small
water-birds
went
past
me
flying
very
fast
to
the
westwards
the
quick
whir
of
their
wings
and
their
musical
cry
were
cheery
to
my
ear
i
fancy
that
they
were
teal
but
i
am
a
wretched
zoologist
now
that
we
humans
have
become
birds
we
must
really
learn
to
know
our
brethren
by
sight
the
wind
down
beneath
me
whirled
and
swayed
the
broad
cloud-plain
once
a
great
eddy
formed
in
it
a
whirlpool
of
vapour
and
through
it
as
down
a
funnel
i
caught
sight
of
the
distant
world
a
large
white
biplane
was
passing
at
a
vast
depth
beneath
me
i
fancy
it
was
the
morning
mail
service
betwixt
bristol
and
london
then
the
drift
swirled
inwards
again
and
the
great
solitude
was
unbroken
just
after
ten
i
touched
the
lower
edge
of
the
upper
cloud-stratum
it
consisted
of
fine
diaphanous
vapour
drifting
swiftly
from
the
westwards
the
wind
had
been
steadily
rising
all
this
time
and
it
was
now
blowing
a
sharp
breeze--twenty-eight
an
hour
by
my
gauge
already
it
was
very
cold
though
my
altimeter
only
marked
nine
thousand
the
engines
were
working
beautifully
and
we
went
droning
steadily
upwards
the
cloud-bank
was
thicker
than
i
had
expected
but
at
last
it
thinned
out
into
a
golden
mist
before
me
and
then
in
an
instant
i
had
shot
out
from
it
and
there
was
an
unclouded
sky
and
a
brilliant
sun
above
my
head--all
blue
and
gold
above
all
shining
silver
below
one
vast
glimmering
plain
as
far
as
my
eyes
could
reach
it
was
a
quarter
past
ten
o'clock
and
the
barograph
needle
pointed
to
twelve
thousand
eight
hundred
up
i
went
and
up
my
ears
concentrated
upon
the
deep
purring
of
my
motor
my
eyes
busy
always
with
the
watch
the
revolution
indicator
the
petrol
lever
and
the
oil
pump
no
wonder
aviators
are
said
to
be
a
fearless
race
with
so
many
things
to
think
of
there
is
no
time
to
trouble
about
oneself
about
this
time
i
noted
how
unreliable
is
the
compass
when
above
a
certain
height
from
earth
at
fifteen
thousand
feet
mine
was
pointing
east
and
a
point
south
the
sun
and
the
wind
gave
me
my
true
bearings
i
had
hoped
to
reach
an
eternal
stillness
in
these
high
altitudes
but
with
every
thousand
feet
of
ascent
the
gale
grew
stronger
my
machine
groaned
and
trembled
in
every
joint
and
rivet
as
she
faced
it
and
swept
away
like
a
sheet
of
paper
when
i
banked
her
on
the
turn
skimming
down
wind
at
a
greater
pace
perhaps
than
ever
mortal
man
has
moved
yet
i
had
always
to
turn
again
and
tack
up
in
the
wind's
eye
for
it
was
not
merely
a
height
record
that
i
was
after
by
all
my
calculations
it
was
above
little
wiltshire
that
my
air-jungle
lay
and
all
my
labour
might
be
lost
if
i
struck
the
outer
layers
at
some
farther
point
when
i
reached
the
nineteen-thousand-foot
level
which
was
about
midday
the
wind
was
so
severe
that
i
looked
with
some
anxiety
to
the
stays
of
my
wings
expecting
momentarily
to
see
them
snap
or
slacken
i
even
cast
loose
the
parachute
behind
me
and
fastened
its
hook
into
the
ring
of
my
leathern
belt
so
as
to
be
ready
for
the
worst
now
was
the
time
when
a
bit
of
scamped
work
by
the
mechanic
is
paid
for
by
the
life
of
the
aeronaut
but
she
held
together
bravely
every
cord
and
strut
was
humming
and
vibrating
like
so
many
harp-strings
but
it
was
glorious
to
see
how
for
all
the
beating
and
the
buffeting
she
was
still
the
conqueror
of
nature
and
the
mistress
of
the
sky
there
is
surely
something
divine
in
man
himself
that
he
should
rise
so
superior
to
the
limitations
which
creation
seemed
to
impose--rise
too
by
such
unselfish
heroic
devotion
as
this
air-conquest
has
shown
talk
of
human
degeneration
when
has
such
a
story
as
this
been
written
in
the
annals
of
our
race
these
were
the
thoughts
in
my
head
as
i
climbed
that
monstrous
inclined
plane
with
the
wind
sometimes
beating
in
my
face
and
sometimes
whistling
behind
my
ears
while
the
cloud-land
beneath
me
fell
away
to
such
a
distance
that
the
folds
and
hummocks
of
silver
had
all
smoothed
out
into
one
flat
shining
plain
but
suddenly
i
had
a
horrible
and
unprecedented
experience
i
have
known
before
what
it
is
to
be
in
what
our
neighbours
have
called
a
tourbillon
but
never
on
such
a
scale
as
this
that
huge
sweeping
river
of
wind
of
which
i
have
spoken
had
as
it
appears
whirlpools
within
it
which
were
as
monstrous
as
itself
without
a
moment's
warning
i
was
dragged
suddenly
into
the
heart
of
one
i
spun
round
for
a
minute
or
two
with
such
velocity
that
i
almost
lost
my
senses
and
then
fell
suddenly
left
wing
foremost
down
the
vacuum
funnel
in
the
centre
i
dropped
like
a
stone
and
lost
nearly
a
thousand
feet
it
was
only
my
belt
that
kept
me
in
my
seat
and
the
shock
and
breathlessness
left
me
hanging
half-insensible
over
the
side
of
the
fuselage
but
i
am
always
capable
of
a
supreme
effort--it
is
my
one
great
merit
as
an
aviator
i
was
conscious
that
the
descent
was
slower
the
whirlpool
was
a
cone
rather
than
a
funnel
and
i
had
come
to
the
apex
with
a
terrific
wrench
throwing
my
weight
all
to
one
side
i
levelled
my
planes
and
brought
her
head
away
from
the
wind
in
an
instant
i
had
shot
out
of
the
eddies
and
was
skimming
down
the
sky
then
shaken
but
victorious
i
turned
her
nose
up
and
began
once
more
my
steady
grind
on
the
upward
spiral
i
took
a
large
sweep
to
avoid
the
danger-spot
of
the
whirlpool
and
soon
i
was
safely
above
it
just
after
one
o'clock
i
was
twenty-one
thousand
feet
above
the
sea-level
to
my
great
joy
i
had
topped
the
gale
and
with
every
hundred
feet
of
ascent
the
air
grew
stiller
on
the
other
hand
it
was
very
cold
and
i
was
conscious
of
that
peculiar
nausea
which
goes
with
rarefaction
of
the
air
for
the
first
time
i
unscrewed
the
mouth
of
my
oxygen
bag
and
took
an
occasional
whiff
of
the
glorious
gas
i
could
feel
it
running
like
a
cordial
through
my
veins
and
i
was
exhilarated
almost
to
the
point
of
drunkenness
i
shouted
and
sang
as
i
soared
upwards
into
the
cold
still
outer
world
it
is
very
clear
to
me
that
the
insensibility
which
came
upon
glaisher
and
in
a
lesser
degree
upon
coxwell
when
in
1862
they
ascended
in
a
balloon
to
the
height
of
thirty
thousand
feet
was
due
to
the
extreme
speed
with
which
a
perpendicular
ascent
is
made
doing
it
at
an
easy
gradient
and
accustoming
oneself
to
the
lessened
barometric
pressure
by
slow
degrees
there
are
no
such
dreadful
symptoms
at
the
same
great
height
i
found
that
even
without
my
oxygen
inhaler
i
could
breathe
without
undue
distress
it
was
bitterly
cold
however
and
my
thermometer
was
at
zero
fahrenheit
at
one-thirty
i
was
nearly
seven
miles
above
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
still
ascending
steadily
i
found
however
that
the
rarefied
air
was
giving
markedly
less
support
to
my
planes
and
that
my
angle
of
ascent
had
to
be
considerably
lowered
in
consequence
it
was
already
clear
that
even
with
my
light
weight
and
strong
engine-power
there
was
a
point
in
front
of
me
where
i
should
be
held
to
make
matters
worse
one
of
my
sparking-plugs
was
in
trouble
again
and
there
was
intermittent
misfiring
in
the
engine
my
heart
was
heavy
with
the
fear
of
failure
it
was
about
that
time
that
i
had
a
most
extraordinary
experience
something
whizzed
past
me
in
a
trail
of
smoke
and
exploded
with
a
loud
hissing
sound
sending
forth
a
cloud
of
steam
for
the
instant
i
could
not
imagine
what
had
happened
then
i
remembered
that
the
earth
is
for
ever
being
bombarded
by
meteor
stones
and
would
be
hardly
inhabitable
were
they
not
in
nearly
every
case
turned
to
vapour
in
the
outer
layers
of
the
atmosphere
here
is
a
new
danger
for
the
high-altitude
man
for
two
others
passed
me
when
i
was
nearing
the
forty-thousand-foot
mark
i
cannot
doubt
that
at
the
edge
of
the
earth's
envelope
the
risk
would
be
a
very
real
one
my
barograph
needle
marked
forty-one
thousand
three
hundred
when
i
became
aware
that
i
could
go
no
farther
physically
the
strain
was
not
as
yet
greater
than
i
could
bear
but
my
machine
had
reached
its
limit
the
attenuated
air
gave
no
firm
support
to
the
wings
and
the
least
tilt
developed
into
side-slip
while
she
seemed
sluggish
on
her
controls
possibly
had
the
engine
been
at
its
best
another
thousand
feet
might
have
been
within
our
capacity
but
it
was
still
misfiring
and
two
out
of
the
ten
cylinders
appeared
to
be
out
of
action
if
i
had
not
already
reached
the
zone
for
which
i
was
searching
then
i
should
never
see
it
upon
this
journey
but
was
it
not
possible
that
i
had
attained
it
soaring
in
circles
like
a
monstrous
hawk
upon
the
forty-thousand-foot
level
i
let
the
monoplane
guide
herself
and
with
my
mannheim
glass
i
made
a
careful
observation
of
my
surroundings
the
heavens
were
perfectly
clear
there
was
no
indication
of
those
dangers
which
i
had
imagined
i
have
said
that
i
was
soaring
in
circles
it
struck
me
suddenly
that
i
would
do
well
to
take
a
wider
sweep
and
open
up
a
new
airtract
if
the
hunter
entered
an
earth-jungle
he
would
drive
through
it
if
he
wished
to
find
his
game
my
reasoning
had
led
me
to
believe
that
the
air-jungle
which
i
had
imagined
lay
somewhere
over
wiltshire
this
should
be
to
the
south
and
west
of
me
i
took
my
bearings
from
the
sun
for
the
compass
was
hopeless
and
no
trace
of
earth
was
to
be
seen--nothing
but
the
distant
silver
cloud-plain
however
i
got
my
direction
as
best
i
might
and
kept
her
head
straight
to
the
mark
i
reckoned
that
my
petrol
supply
would
not
last
for
more
than
another
hour
or
so
but
i
could
afford
to
use
it
to
the
last
drop
since
a
single
magnificent
vol-plane
could
at
any
time
take
me
to
the
earth
suddenly
i
was
aware
of
something
new
the
air
in
front
of
me
had
lost
its
crystal
clearness
it
was
full
of
long
ragged
wisps
of
something
which
i
can
only
compare
to
very
fine
cigarette
smoke
it
hung
about
in
wreaths
and
coils
turning
and
twisting
slowly
in
the
sunlight
as
the
monoplane
shot
through
it
i
was
aware
of
a
faint
taste
of
oil
upon
my
lips
and
there
was
a
greasy
scum
upon
the
woodwork
of
the
machine
some
infinitely
fine
organic
matter
appeared
to
be
suspended
in
the
atmosphere
there
was
no
life
there
it
was
inchoate
and
diffuse
extending
for
many
square
acres
and
then
fringing
off
into
the
void
no
it
was
not
life
but
might
it
not
be
the
remains
of
life
above
all
might
it
not
be
the
food
of
life
of
monstrous
life
even
as
the
humble
grease
of
the
ocean
is
the
food
for
the
mighty
whale
the
thought
was
in
my
mind
when
my
eyes
looked
upwards
and
i
saw
the
most
wonderful
vision
that
ever
man
has
seen
can
i
hope
to
convey
it
to
you
even
as
i
saw
it
myself
last
thursday
conceive
a
jelly-fish
such
as
sails
in
our
summer
seas
bell-shaped
and
of
enormous
size--far
larger
i
should
judge
than
the
dome
of
st
paul's
it
was
of
a
light
pink
colour
veined
with
a
delicate
green
but
the
whole
huge
fabric
so
tenuous
that
it
was
but
a
fairy
outline
against
the
dark
blue
sky
it
pulsated
with
a
delicate
and
regular
rhythm
from
it
there
depended
two
long
drooping
green
tentacles
which
swayed
slowly
backwards
and
forwards
this
gorgeous
vision
passed
gently
with
noiseless
dignity
over
my
head
as
light
and
fragile
as
a
soap-bubble
and
drifted
upon
its
stately
way
i
had
half-turned
my
monoplane
that
i
might
look
after
this
beautiful
creature
when
in
a
moment
i
found
myself
amidst
a
perfect
fleet
of
them
of
all
sizes
but
none
so
large
as
the
first
some
were
quite
small
but
the
majority
about
as
big
as
an
average
balloon
and
with
much
the
same
curvature
at
the
top
there
was
in
them
a
delicacy
of
texture
and
colouring
which
reminded
me
of
the
finest
venetian
glass
pale
shades
of
pink
and
green
were
the
prevailing
tints
but
all
had
a
lovely
iridescence
where
the
sun
shimmered
through
their
dainty
forms
some
hundreds
of
them
drifted
past
me
a
wonderful
fairy
squadron
of
strange
unknown
argosies
of
the
sky--creatures
whose
forms
and
substance
were
so
attuned
to
these
pure
heights
that
one
could
not
conceive
anything
so
delicate
within
actual
sight
or
sound
of
earth
but
soon
my
attention
was
drawn
to
a
new
phenomenon--the
serpents
of
the
outer
air
these
were
long
thin
fantastic
coils
of
vapour-like
material
which
turned
and
twisted
with
great
speed
flying
round
and
round
at
such
a
pace
that
the
eyes
could
hardly
follow
them
some
of
these
ghost-like
creatures
were
twenty
or
thirty
feet
long
but
it
was
difficult
to
tell
their
girth
for
their
outline
was
so
hazy
that
it
seemed
to
fade
away
into
the
air
around
them
these
air-snakes
were
of
a
very
light
grey
or
smoke
colour
with
some
darker
lines
within
which
gave
the
impression
of
a
definite
organism
one
of
them
whisked
past
my
very
face
and
i
was
conscious
of
a
cold
clammy
contact
but
their
composition
was
so
unsubstantial
that
i
could
not
connect
them
with
any
thought
of
physical
danger
any
more
than
the
beautiful
bell-like
creatures
which
had
preceded
them
there
was
no
more
solidity
in
their
frames
than
in
the
floating
spume
from
a
broken
wave
but
a
more
terrible
experience
was
in
store
for
me
floating
downwards
from
a
great
height
there
came
a
purplish
patch
of
vapour
small
as
i
saw
it
first
but
rapidly
enlarging
as
it
approached
me
until
it
appeared
to
be
hundreds
of
square
feet
in
size
though
fashioned
of
some
transparent
jelly-like
substance
it
was
none
the
less
of
much
more
definite
outline
and
solid
consistence
than
anything
which
i
had
seen
before
there
were
more
traces
too
of
a
physical
organization
especially
two
vast
shadowy
circular
plates
upon
either
side
which
may
have
been
eyes
and
a
perfectly
solid
white
projection
between
them
which
was
as
curved
and
cruel
as
the
beak
of
a
vulture
the
whole
aspect
of
this
monster
was
formidable
and
threatening
and
it
kept
changing
its
colour
from
a
very
light
mauve
to
a
dark
angry
purple
so
thick
that
it
cast
a
shadow
as
it
drifted
between
my
monoplane
and
the
sun
on
the
upper
curve
of
its
huge
body
there
were
three
great
projections
which
i
can
only
describe
as
enormous
bubbles
and
i
was
convinced
as
i
looked
at
them
that
they
were
charged
with
some
extremely
light
gas
which
served
to
buoy
up
the
misshapen
and
semi-solid
mass
in
the
rarefied
air
the
creature
moved
swiftly
along
keeping
pace
easily
with
the
monoplane
and
for
twenty
miles
or
more
it
formed
my
horrible
escort
hovering
over
me
like
a
bird
of
prey
which
is
waiting
to
pounce
its
method
of
progression--done
so
swiftly
that
it
was
not
easy
to
follow--was
to
throw
out
a
long
glutinous
streamer
in
front
of
it
which
in
turn
seemed
to
draw
forward
the
rest
of
the
writhing
body
so
elastic
and
gelatinous
was
it
that
never
for
two
successive
minutes
was
it
the
same
shape
and
yet
each
change
made
it
more
threatening
and
loathsome
than
the
last
i
knew
that
it
meant
mischief
every
purple
flush
of
its
hideous
body
told
me
so
the
vague
goggling
eyes
which
were
turned
always
upon
me
were
cold
and
merciless
in
their
viscid
hatred
i
dipped
the
nose
of
my
monoplane
downwards
to
escape
it
as
i
did
so
as
quick
as
a
flash
there
shot
out
a
long
tentacle
from
this
mass
of
floating
blubber
and
it
fell
as
light
and
sinuous
as
a
whip-lash
across
the
front
of
my
machine
there
was
a
loud
hiss
as
it
lay
for
a
moment
across
the
hot
engine
and
it
whisked
itself
into
the
air
again
while
the
huge
flat
body
drew
itself
together
as
if
in
sudden
pain
i
dipped
to
a
vol-pique
but
again
a
tentacle
fell
over
the
monoplane
and
was
shorn
off
by
the
propeller
as
easily
as
it
might
have
cut
through
a
smoke
wreath
a
long
gliding
sticky
serpent-like
coil
came
from
behind
and
caught
me
round
the
waist
dragging
me
out
of
the
fuselage
i
tore
at
it
my
fingers
sinking
into
the
smooth
glue-like
surface
and
for
an
instant
i
disengaged
myself
but
only
to
be
caught
round
the
boot
by
another
coil
which
gave
me
a
jerk
that
tilted
me
almost
on
to
my
back
as
i
fell
over
i
blazed
off
both
barrels
of
my
gun
though
indeed
it
was
like
attacking
an
elephant
with
a
pea-shooter
to
imagine
that
any
human
weapon
could
cripple
that
mighty
bulk
and
yet
i
aimed
better
than
i
knew
for
with
a
loud
report
one
of
the
great
blisters
upon
the
creature's
back
exploded
with
the
puncture
of
the
buck-shot
it
was
very
clear
that
my
conjecture
was
right
and
that
these
vast
clear
bladders
were
distended
with
some
lifting
gas
for
in
an
instant
the
huge
cloud-like
body
turned
sideways
writhing
desperately
to
find
its
balance
while
the
white
beak
snapped
and
gaped
in
horrible
fury
but
already
i
had
shot
away
on
the
steepest
glide
that
i
dared
to
attempt
my
engine
still
full
on
the
flying
propeller
and
the
force
of
gravity
shooting
me
downwards
like
an
aerolite
far
behind
me
i
saw
a
dull
purplish
smudge
growing
swiftly
smaller
and
merging
into
the
blue
sky
behind
it
i
was
safe
out
of
the
deadly
jungle
of
the
outer
air
once
out
of
danger
i
throttled
my
engine
for
nothing
tears
a
machine
to
pieces
quicker
than
running
on
full
power
from
a
height
it
was
a
glorious
spiral
vol-plane
from
nearly
eight
miles
of
altitude--first
to
the
level
of
the
silver
cloud-bank
then
to
that
of
the
storm-cloud
beneath
it
and
finally
in
beating
rain
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
i
saw
the
bristol
channel
beneath
me
as
i
broke
from
the
clouds
but
having
still
some
petrol
in
my
tank
i
got
twenty
miles
inland
before
i
found
myself
stranded
in
a
field
half
a
mile
from
the
village
of
ashcombe
there
i
got
three
tins
of
petrol
from
a
passing
motor-car
and
at
ten
minutes
past
six
that
evening
i
alighted
gently
in
my
own
home
meadow
at
devizes
after
such
a
journey
as
no
mortal
upon
earth
has
ever
yet
taken
and
lived
to
tell
the
tale
i
have
seen
the
beauty
and
i
have
seen
the
horror
of
the
heights--and
greater
beauty
or
greater
horror
than
that
is
not
within
the
ken
of
man
and
now
it
is
my
plan
to
go
once
again
before
i
give
my
results
to
the
world
my
reason
for
this
is
that
i
must
surely
have
something
to
show
by
way
of
proof
before
i
lay
such
a
tale
before
my
fellow-men
it
is
true
that
others
will
soon
follow
and
will
confirm
what
i
have
said
and
yet
i
should
wish
to
carry
conviction
from
the
first
those
lovely
iridescent
bubbles
of
the
air
should
not
be
hard
to
capture
they
drift
slowly
upon
their
way
and
the
swift
monoplane
could
intercept
their
leisurely
course
it
is
likely
enough
that
they
would
dissolve
in
the
heavier
layers
of
the
atmosphere
and
that
some
small
heap
of
amorphous
jelly
might
be
all
that
i
should
bring
to
earth
with
me
and
yet
something
there
would
surely
be
by
which
i
could
substantiate
my
story
yes
i
will
go
even
if
i
run
a
risk
by
doing
so
these
purple
horrors
would
not
seem
to
be
numerous
it
is
probable
that
i
shall
not
see
one
if
i
do
i
shall
dive
at
once
at
the
worst
there
is
always
the
shot-gun
and
my
knowledge
of

here
a
page
of
the
manuscript
is
unfortunately
missing
on
the
next
page
is
written
in
large
straggling
writing
forty-three
thousand
feet
i
shall
never
see
earth
again
they
are
beneath
me
three
of
them
god
help
me
it
is
a
dreadful
death
to
die
such
in
its
entirety
is
the
joyce-armstrong
statement
of
the
man
nothing
has
since
been
seen
pieces
of
his
shattered
monoplane
have
been
picked
up
in
the
preserves
of
mr
budd-lushington
upon
the
borders
of
kent
and
sussex
within
a
few
miles
of
the
spot
where
the
note-book
was
discovered
if
the
unfortunate
aviator's
theory
is
correct
that
this
air-jungle
as
he
called
it
existed
only
over
the
south-west
of
england
then
it
would
seem
that
he
had
fled
from
it
at
the
full
speed
of
his
monoplane
but
had
been
overtaken
and
devoured
by
these
horrible
creatures
at
some
spot
in
the
outer
atmosphere
above
the
place
where
the
grim
relics
were
found
the
picture
of
that
monoplane
skimming
down
the
sky
with
the
nameless
terrors
flying
as
swiftly
beneath
it
and
cutting
it
off
always
from
the
earth
while
they
gradually
closed
in
upon
their
victim
is
one
upon
which
a
man
who
valued
his
sanity
would
prefer
not
to
dwell
there
are
many
as
i
am
aware
who
still
jeer
at
the
facts
which
i
have
here
set
down
but
even
they
must
admit
that
joyce-armstrong
has
disappeared
and
i
would
commend
to
them
his
own
words
this
note-book
may
explain
what
i
am
trying
to
do
and
how
i
lost
my
life
in
doing
it
but
no
drivel
about
accidents
or
mysteries
if
you
please
the
leather
funnel
my
friend
lionel
dacre
lived
in
the
avenue
de
wagram
paris
his
house
was
that
small
one
with
the
iron
railings
and
grass
plot
in
front
of
it
on
the
left-hand
side
as
you
pass
down
from
the
arc
de
triomphe
i
fancy
that
it
had
been
there
long
before
the
avenue
was
constructed
for
the
grey
tiles
were
stained
with
lichens
and
the
walls
were
mildewed
and
discoloured
with
age
it
looked
a
small
house
from
the
street
five
windows
in
front
if
i
remember
right
but
it
deepened
into
a
single
long
chamber
at
the
back
it
was
here
that
dacre
had
that
singular
library
of
occult
literature
and
the
fantastic
curiosities
which
served
as
a
hobby
for
himself
and
an
amusement
for
his
friends
a
wealthy
man
of
refined
and
eccentric
tastes
he
had
spent
much
of
his
life
and
fortune
in
gathering
together
what
was
said
to
be
a
unique
private
collection
of
talmudic
cabalistic
and
magical
works
many
of
them
of
great
rarity
and
value
his
tastes
leaned
toward
the
marvellous
and
the
monstrous
and
i
have
heard
that
his
experiments
in
the
direction
of
the
unknown
have
passed
all
the
bounds
of
civilization
and
of
decorum
to
his
english
friends
he
never
alluded
to
such
matters
and
took
the
tone
of
the
student
and
virtuoso
but
a
frenchman
whose
tastes
were
of
the
same
nature
has
assured
me
that
the
worst
excesses
of
the
black
mass
have
been
perpetrated
in
that
large
and
lofty
hall
which
is
lined
with
the
shelves
of
his
books
and
the
cases
of
his
museum
dacre's
appearance
was
enough
to
show
that
his
deep
interest
in
these
psychic
matters
was
intellectual
rather
than
spiritual
there
was
no
trace
of
asceticism
upon
his
heavy
face
but
there
was
much
mental
force
in
his
huge
dome-like
skull
which
curved
upward
from
amongst
his
thinning
locks
like
a
snowpeak
above
its
fringe
of
fir
trees
his
knowledge
was
greater
than
his
wisdom
and
his
powers
were
far
superior
to
his
character
the
small
bright
eyes
buried
deeply
in
his
fleshy
face
twinkled
with
intelligence
and
an
unabated
curiosity
of
life
but
they
were
the
eyes
of
a
sensualist
and
an
egotist
enough
of
the
man
for
he
is
dead
now
poor
devil
dead
at
the
very
time
that
he
had
made
sure
that
he
had
at
last
discovered
the
elixir
of
life
it
is
not
with
his
complex
character
that
i
have
to
deal
but
with
the
very
strange
and
inexplicable
incident
which
had
its
rise
in
my
visit
to
him
in
the
early
spring
of
the
year
'82
i
had
known
dacre
in
england
for
my
researches
in
the
assyrian
room
of
the
british
museum
had
been
conducted
at
the
time
when
he
was
endeavouring
to
establish
a
mystic
and
esoteric
meaning
in
the
babylonian
tablets
and
this
community
of
interests
had
brought
us
together
chance
remarks
had
led
to
daily
conversation
and
that
to
something
verging
upon
friendship
i
had
promised
him
that
on
my
next
visit
to
paris
i
would
call
upon
him
at
the
time
when
i
was
able
to
fulfil
my
compact
i
was
living
in
a
cottage
at
fontainebleau
and
as
the
evening
trains
were
inconvenient
he
asked
me
to
spend
the
night
in
his
house
i
have
only
that
one
spare
couch
said
he
pointing
to
a
broad
sofa
in
his
large
salon
i
hope
that
you
will
manage
to
be
comfortable
there
it
was
a
singular
bedroom
with
its
high
walls
of
brown
volumes
but
there
could
be
no
more
agreeable
furniture
to
a
bookworm
like
myself
and
there
is
no
scent
so
pleasant
to
my
nostrils
as
that
faint
subtle
reek
which
comes
from
an
ancient
book
i
assured
him
that
i
could
desire
no
more
charming
chamber
and
no
more
congenial
surroundings
if
the
fittings
are
neither
convenient
nor
conventional
they
are
at
least
costly
said
he
looking
round
at
his
shelves
i
have
expended
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
money
upon
these
objects
which
surround
you
books
weapons
gems
carvings
tapestries
images--there
is
hardly
a
thing
here
which
has
not
its
history
and
it
is
generally
one
worth
telling
he
was
seated
as
he
spoke
at
one
side
of
the
open
fire-place
and
i
at
the
other
his
reading-table
was
on
his
right
and
the
strong
lamp
above
it
ringed
it
with
a
very
vivid
circle
of
golden
light
a
half-rolled
palimpsest
lay
in
the
centre
and
around
it
were
many
quaint
articles
of
bric-a-brac
one
of
these
was
a
large
funnel
such
as
is
used
for
filling
wine
casks
it
appeared
to
be
made
of
black
wood
and
to
be
rimmed
with
discoloured
brass
that
is
a
curious
thing
i
remarked
what
is
the
history
of
that
ah
said
he
it
is
the
very
question
which
i
have
had
occasion
to
ask
myself
i
would
give
a
good
deal
to
know
take
it
in
your
hands
and
examine
it
i
did
so
and
found
that
what
i
had
imagined
to
be
wood
was
in
reality
leather
though
age
had
dried
it
into
an
extreme
hardness
it
was
a
large
funnel
and
might
hold
a
quart
when
full
the
brass
rim
encircled
the
wide
end
but
the
narrow
was
also
tipped
with
metal
what
do
you
make
of
it
asked
dacre
i
should
imagine
that
it
belonged
to
some
vintner
or
maltster
in
the
middle
ages
said
i
i
have
seen
in
england
leathern
drinking
flagons
of
the
seventeenth
century--'black
jacks'
as
they
were
called--which
were
of
the
same
colour
and
hardness
as
this
filler
i
dare
say
the
date
would
be
about
the
same
said
dacre
and
no
doubt
also
it
was
used
for
filling
a
vessel
with
liquid
if
my
suspicions
are
correct
however
it
was
a
queer
vintner
who
used
it
and
a
very
singular
cask
which
was
filled
do
you
observe
nothing
strange
at
the
spout
end
of
the
funnel
as
i
held
it
to
the
light
i
observed
that
at
a
spot
some
five
inches
above
the
brass
tip
the
narrow
neck
of
the
leather
funnel
was
all
haggled
and
scored
as
if
someone
had
notched
it
round
with
a
blunt
knife
only
at
that
point
was
there
any
roughening
of
the
dead
black
surface
someone
has
tried
to
cut
off
the
neck
would
you
call
it
a
cut
it
is
torn
and
lacerated
it
must
have
taken
some
strength
to
leave
these
marks
on
such
tough
material
whatever
the
instrument
may
have
been
but
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
can
tell
that
you
know
more
than
you
say
dacre
smiled
and
his
little
eyes
twinkled
with
knowledge
have
you
included
the
psychology
of
dreams
among
your
learned
studies
he
asked
i
did
not
even
know
that
there
was
such
a
psychology
my
dear
sir
that
shelf
above
the
gem
case
is
filled
with
volumes
from
albertus
magnus
onward
which
deal
with
no
other
subject
it
is
a
science
in
itself
a
science
of
charlatans
the
charlatan
is
always
the
pioneer
from
the
astrologer
came
the
astronomer
from
the
alchemist
the
chemist
from
the
mesmerist
the
experimental
psychologist
the
quack
of
yesterday
is
the
professor
of
tomorrow
even
such
subtle
and
elusive
things
as
dreams
will
in
time
be
reduced
to
system
and
order
when
that
time
comes
the
researches
of
our
friends
on
the
bookshelf
yonder
will
no
longer
be
the
amusement
of
the
mystic
but
the
foundations
of
a
science
supposing
that
is
so
what
has
the
science
of
dreams
to
do
with
a
large
black
brass-rimmed
funnel
i
will
tell
you
you
know
that
i
have
an
agent
who
is
always
on
the
look-out
for
rarities
and
curiosities
for
my
collection
some
days
ago
he
heard
of
a
dealer
upon
one
of
the
quais
who
had
acquired
some
old
rubbish
found
in
a
cupboard
in
an
ancient
house
at
the
back
of
the
rue
mathurin
in
the
quartier
latin
the
dining-room
of
this
old
house
is
decorated
with
a
coat
of
arms
chevrons
and
bars
rouge
upon
a
field
argent
which
prove
upon
inquiry
to
be
the
shield
of
nicholas
de
la
reynie
a
high
official
of
king
louis
xiv
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
other
articles
in
the
cupboard
date
back
to
the
early
days
of
that
king
the
inference
is
therefore
that
they
were
all
the
property
of
this
nicholas
de
la
reynie
who
was
as
i
understand
the
gentleman
specially
concerned
with
the
maintenance
and
execution
of
the
draconic
laws
of
that
epoch
what
then
i
would
ask
you
now
to
take
the
funnel
into
your
hands
once
more
and
to
examine
the
upper
brass
rim
can
you
make
out
any
lettering
upon
it
there
were
certainly
some
scratches
upon
it
almost
obliterated
by
time
the
general
effect
was
of
several
letters
the
last
of
which
bore
some
resemblance
to
a
b
you
make
it
a
b
yes
i
do
so
do
i
in
fact
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
it
is
a
b
but
the
nobleman
you
mentioned
would
have
had
r
for
his
initial
exactly
that's
the
beauty
of
it
he
owned
this
curious
object
and
yet
he
had
someone
else's
initials
upon
it
why
did
he
do
this
i
can't
imagine
can
you
well
i
might
perhaps
guess
do
you
observe
something
drawn
a
little
farther
along
the
rim
i
should
say
it
was
a
crown
it
is
undoubtedly
a
crown
but
if
you
examine
it
in
a
good
light
you
will
convince
yourself
that
it
is
not
an
ordinary
crown
it
is
a
heraldic
crown--a
badge
of
rank
and
it
consists
of
an
alternation
of
four
pearls
and
strawberry
leaves
the
proper
badge
of
a
marquis
we
may
infer
therefore
that
the
person
whose
initials
end
in
b
was
entitled
to
wear
that
coronet
then
this
common
leather
filler
belonged
to
a
marquis
dacre
gave
a
peculiar
smile
or
to
some
member
of
the
family
of
a
marquis
said
he
so
much
we
have
clearly
gathered
from
this
engraved
rim
but
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
dreams
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
from
a
look
upon
dacre's
face
or
from
some
subtle
suggestion
in
his
manner
but
a
feeling
of
repulsion
of
unreasoning
horror
came
upon
me
as
i
looked
at
the
gnarled
old
lump
of
leather
i
have
more
than
once
received
important
information
through
my
dreams
said
my
companion
in
the
didactic
manner
which
he
loved
to
affect
i
make
it
a
rule
now
when
i
am
in
doubt
upon
any
material
point
to
place
the
article
in
question
beside
me
as
i
sleep
and
to
hope
for
some
enlightenment
the
process
does
not
appear
to
me
to
be
very
obscure
though
it
has
not
yet
received
the
blessing
of
orthodox
science
according
to
my
theory
any
object
which
has
been
intimately
associated
with
any
supreme
paroxysm
of
human
emotion
whether
it
be
joy
or
pain
will
retain
a
certain
atmosphere
or
association
which
it
is
capable
of
communicating
to
a
sensitive
mind
by
a
sensitive
mind
i
do
not
mean
an
abnormal
one
but
such
a
trained
and
educated
mind
as
you
or
i
possess
you
mean
for
example
that
if
i
slept
beside
that
old
sword
upon
the
wall
i
might
dream
of
some
bloody
incident
in
which
that
very
sword
took
part
an
excellent
example
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
sword
was
used
in
that
fashion
by
me
and
i
saw
in
my
sleep
the
death
of
its
owner
who
perished
in
a
brisk
skirmish
which
i
have
been
unable
to
identify
but
which
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
wars
of
the
frondists
if
you
think
of
it
some
of
our
popular
observances
show
that
the
fact
has
already
been
recognized
by
our
ancestors
although
we
in
our
wisdom
have
classed
it
among
superstitions
for
example
well
the
placing
of
the
bride's
cake
beneath
the
pillow
in
order
that
the
sleeper
may
have
pleasant
dreams
that
is
one
of
several
instances
which
you
will
find
set
forth
in
a
small
brochure
which
i
am
myself
writing
upon
the
subject
but
to
come
back
to
the
point
i
slept
one
night
with
this
funnel
beside
me
and
i
had
a
dream
which
certainly
throws
a
curious
light
upon
its
use
and
origin
what
did
you
dream
i
dreamed----
he
paused
and
an
intent
look
of
interest
came
over
his
massive
face
by
jove
that's
well
thought
of
said
he
this
really
will
be
an
exceedingly
interesting
experiment
you
are
yourself
a
psychic
subject--with
nerves
which
respond
readily
to
any
impression
i
have
never
tested
myself
in
that
direction
then
we
shall
test
you
tonight
might
i
ask
you
as
a
very
great
favour
when
you
occupy
that
couch
tonight
to
sleep
with
this
old
funnel
placed
by
the
side
of
your
pillow
the
request
seemed
to
me
a
grotesque
one
but
i
have
myself
in
my
complex
nature
a
hunger
after
all
which
is
bizarre
and
fantastic
i
had
not
the
faintest
belief
in
dacre's
theory
nor
any
hopes
for
success
in
such
an
experiment
yet
it
amused
me
that
the
experiment
should
be
made
dacre
with
great
gravity
drew
a
small
stand
to
the
head
of
my
settee
and
placed
the
funnel
upon
it
then
after
a
short
conversation
he
wished
me
good
night
and
left
me
i
sat
for
some
little
time
smoking
by
the
smouldering
fire
and
turning
over
in
my
mind
the
curious
incident
which
had
occurred
and
the
strange
experience
which
might
lie
before
me
sceptical
as
i
was
there
was
something
impressive
in
the
assurance
of
dacre's
manner
and
my
extraordinary
surroundings
the
huge
room
with
the
strange
and
often
sinister
objects
which
were
hung
round
it
struck
solemnity
into
my
soul
finally
i
undressed
and
turning
out
the
lamp
i
lay
down
after
long
tossing
i
fell
asleep
let
me
try
to
describe
as
accurately
as
i
can
the
scene
which
came
to
me
in
my
dreams
it
stands
out
now
in
my
memory
more
clearly
than
anything
which
i
have
seen
with
my
waking
eyes
there
was
a
room
which
bore
the
appearance
of
a
vault
four
spandrels
from
the
corners
ran
up
to
join
a
sharp
cup-shaped
roof
the
architecture
was
rough
but
very
strong
it
was
evidently
part
of
a
great
building
three
men
in
black
with
curious
top-heavy
black
velvet
hats
sat
in
a
line
upon
a
red-carpeted
dais
their
faces
were
very
solemn
and
sad
on
the
left
stood
two
long-gowned
men
with
port-folios
in
their
hands
which
seemed
to
be
stuffed
with
papers
upon
the
right
looking
toward
me
was
a
small
woman
with
blonde
hair
and
singular
light-blue
eyes--the
eyes
of
a
child
she
was
past
her
first
youth
but
could
not
yet
be
called
middle-aged
her
figure
was
inclined
to
stoutness
and
her
bearing
was
proud
and
confident
her
face
was
pale
but
serene
it
was
a
curious
face
comely
and
yet
feline
with
a
subtle
suggestion
of
cruelty
about
the
straight
strong
little
mouth
and
chubby
jaw
she
was
draped
in
some
sort
of
loose
white
gown
beside
her
stood
a
thin
eager
priest
who
whispered
in
her
ear
and
continually
raised
a
crucifix
before
her
eyes
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
fixedly
past
the
crucifix
at
the
three
men
in
black
who
were
i
felt
her
judges
as
i
gazed
the
three
men
stood
up
and
said
something
but
i
could
distinguish
no
words
though
i
was
aware
that
it
was
the
central
one
who
was
speaking
they
then
swept
out
of
the
room
followed
by
the
two
men
with
the
papers
at
the
same
instant
several
rough-looking
fellows
in
stout
jerkins
came
bustling
in
and
removed
first
the
red
carpet
and
then
the
boards
which
formed
the
dais
so
as
to
entirely
clear
the
room
when
this
screen
was
removed
i
saw
some
singular
articles
of
furniture
behind
it
one
looked
like
a
bed
with
wooden
rollers
at
each
end
and
a
winch
handle
to
regulate
its
length
another
was
a
wooden
horse
there
were
several
other
curious
objects
and
a
number
of
swinging
cords
which
played
over
pulleys
it
was
not
unlike
a
modern
gymnasium
when
the
room
had
been
cleared
there
appeared
a
new
figure
upon
the
scene
this
was
a
tall
thin
person
clad
in
black
with
a
gaunt
and
austere
face
the
aspect
of
the
man
made
me
shudder
his
clothes
were
all
shining
with
grease
and
mottled
with
stains
he
bore
himself
with
a
slow
and
impressive
dignity
as
if
he
took
command
of
all
things
from
the
instant
of
his
entrance
in
spite
of
his
rude
appearance
and
sordid
dress
it
was
now
his
business
his
room
his
to
command
he
carried
a
coil
of
light
ropes
over
his
left
forearm
the
lady
looked
him
up
and
down
with
a
searching
glance
but
her
expression
was
unchanged
it
was
confident--even
defiant
but
it
was
very
different
with
the
priest
his
face
was
ghastly
white
and
i
saw
the
moisture
glisten
and
run
on
his
high
sloping
forehead
he
threw
up
his
hands
in
prayer
and
he
stooped
continually
to
mutter
frantic
words
in
the
lady's
ear
the
man
in
black
now
advanced
and
taking
one
of
the
cords
from
his
left
arm
he
bound
the
woman's
hands
together
she
held
them
meekly
toward
him
as
he
did
so
then
he
took
her
arm
with
a
rough
grip
and
led
her
toward
the
wooden
horse
which
was
little
higher
than
her
waist
on
to
this
she
was
lifted
and
laid
with
her
back
upon
it
and
her
face
to
the
ceiling
while
the
priest
quivering
with
horror
had
rushed
out
of
the
room
the
woman's
lips
were
moving
rapidly
and
though
i
could
hear
nothing
i
knew
that
she
was
praying
her
feet
hung
down
on
either
side
of
the
horse
and
i
saw
that
the
rough
varlets
in
attendance
had
fastened
cords
to
her
ankles
and
secured
the
other
ends
to
iron
rings
in
the
stone
floor
my
heart
sank
within
me
as
i
saw
these
ominous
preparations
and
yet
i
was
held
by
the
fascination
of
horror
and
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
from
the
strange
spectacle
a
man
had
entered
the
room
with
a
bucket
of
water
in
either
hand
another
followed
with
a
third
bucket
they
were
laid
beside
the
wooden
horse
the
second
man
had
a
wooden
dipper--a
bowl
with
a
straight
handle--in
his
other
hand
this
he
gave
to
the
man
in
black
at
the
same
moment
one
of
the
varlets
approached
with
a
dark
object
in
his
hand
which
even
in
my
dream
filled
me
with
a
vague
feeling
of
familiarity
it
was
a
leathern
filler
with
horrible
energy
he
thrust
it--but
i
could
stand
no
more
my
hair
stood
on
end
with
horror
i
writhed
i
struggled
i
broke
through
the
bonds
of
sleep
and
i
burst
with
a
shriek
into
my
own
life
and
found
myself
lying
shivering
with
terror
in
the
huge
library
with
the
moonlight
flooding
through
the
window
and
throwing
strange
silver
and
black
traceries
upon
the
opposite
wall
oh
what
a
blessed
relief
to
feel
that
i
was
back
in
the
nineteenth
century--back
out
of
that
mediaeval
vault
into
a
world
where
men
had
human
hearts
within
their
bosoms
i
sat
up
on
my
couch
trembling
in
every
limb
my
mind
divided
between
thankfulness
and
horror
to
think
that
such
things
were
ever
done--that
they
could
be
done
without
god
striking
the
villains
dead
was
it
all
a
fantasy
or
did
it
really
stand
for
something
which
had
happened
in
the
black
cruel
days
of
the
world's
history
i
sank
my
throbbing
head
upon
my
shaking
hands
and
then
suddenly
my
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
in
my
bosom
and
i
could
not
even
scream
so
great
was
my
terror
something
was
advancing
toward
me
through
the
darkness
of
the
room
it
is
a
horror
coming
upon
a
horror
which
breaks
a
man's
spirit
i
could
not
reason
i
could
not
pray
i
could
only
sit
like
a
frozen
image
and
glare
at
the
dark
figure
which
was
coming
down
the
great
room
and
then
it
moved
out
into
the
white
lane
of
moonlight
and
i
breathed
once
more
it
was
dacre
and
his
face
showed
that
he
was
as
frightened
as
myself
was
that
you
for
god's
sake
what's
the
matter
he
asked
in
a
husky
voice
oh
dacre
i
am
glad
to
see
you
i
have
been
down
into
hell
it
was
dreadful
then
it
was
you
who
screamed
i
dare
say
it
was
it
rang
through
the
house
the
servants
are
all
terrified
he
struck
a
match
and
lit
the
lamp
i
think
we
may
get
the
fire
to
burn
up
again
he
added
throwing
some
logs
upon
the
embers
good
god
my
dear
chap
how
white
you
are
you
look
as
if
you
had
seen
a
ghost
so
i
have--several
ghosts
the
leather
funnel
has
acted
then
i
wouldn't
sleep
near
the
infernal
thing
again
for
all
the
money
you
could
offer
me
dacre
chuckled
i
expected
that
you
would
have
a
lively
night
of
it
said
he
you
took
it
out
of
me
in
return
for
that
scream
of
yours
wasn't
a
very
pleasant
sound
at
two
in
the
morning
i
suppose
from
what
you
say
that
you
have
seen
the
whole
dreadful
business
what
dreadful
business
the
torture
of
the
water--the
'extraordinary
question'
as
it
was
called
in
the
genial
days
of
'le
roi
soleil'
did
you
stand
it
out
to
the
end
no
thank
god
i
awoke
before
it
really
began
ah
it
is
just
as
well
for
you
i
held
out
till
the
third
bucket
well
it
is
an
old
story
and
they
are
all
in
their
graves
now
anyhow
so
what
does
it
matter
how
they
got
there
i
suppose
that
you
have
no
idea
what
it
was
that
you
have
seen
the
torture
of
some
criminal
she
must
have
been
a
terrible
malefactor
indeed
if
her
crimes
are
in
proportion
to
her
penalty
well
we
have
that
small
consolation
said
dacre
wrapping
his
dressing-gown
round
him
and
crouching
closer
to
the
fire
they
were
in
proportion
to
her
penalty
that
is
to
say
if
i
am
correct
in
the
lady's
identity
how
could
you
possibly
know
her
identity
for
answer
dacre
took
down
an
old
vellum-covered
volume
from
the
shelf
just
listen
to
this
said
he
it
is
in
the
french
of
the
seventeenth
century
but
i
will
give
a
rough
translation
as
i
go
you
will
judge
for
yourself
whether
i
have
solved
the
riddle
or
not
'the
prisoner
was
brought
before
the
grand
chambers
and
tournelles
of
parliament
sitting
as
a
court
of
justice
charged
with
the
murder
of
master
dreux
d'aubray
her
father
and
of
her
two
brothers
mm
d'aubray
one
being
civil
lieutenant
and
the
other
a
counsellor
of
parliament
in
person
it
seemed
hard
to
believe
that
she
had
really
done
such
wicked
deeds
for
she
was
of
a
mild
appearance
and
of
short
stature
with
a
fair
skin
and
blue
eyes
yet
the
court
having
found
her
guilty
condemned
her
to
the
ordinary
and
to
the
extraordinary
question
in
order
that
she
might
be
forced
to
name
her
accomplices
after
which
she
should
be
carried
in
a
cart
to
the
place
de
greve
there
to
have
her
head
cut
off
her
body
being
afterwards
burned
and
her
ashes
scattered
to
the
winds'
the
date
of
this
entry
is
july
16
1676
it
is
interesting
said
i
but
not
convincing
how
do
you
prove
the
two
women
to
be
the
same
i
am
coming
to
that
the
narrative
goes
on
to
tell
of
the
woman's
behaviour
when
questioned
'when
the
executioner
approached
her
she
recognized
him
by
the
cords
which
he
held
in
his
hands
and
she
at
once
held
out
her
own
hands
to
him
looking
at
him
from
head
to
foot
without
uttering
a
word'
how's
that
yes
it
was
so
'she
gazed
without
wincing
upon
the
wooden
horse
and
rings
which
had
twisted
so
many
limbs
and
caused
so
many
shrieks
of
agony
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
three
pails
of
water
which
were
all
ready
for
her
she
said
with
a
smile
all
that
water
must
have
been
brought
here
for
the
purpose
of
drowning
me
monsieur
you
have
no
idea
i
trust
of
making
a
person
of
my
small
stature
swallow
it
all'
shall
i
read
the
details
of
the
torture
no
for
heaven's
sake
don't
here
is
a
sentence
which
must
surely
show
you
that
what
is
here
recorded
is
the
very
scene
which
you
have
gazed
upon
tonight
'the
good
abbe
pirot
unable
to
contemplate
the
agonies
which
were
suffered
by
his
penitent
had
hurried
from
the
room'
does
that
convince
you
it
does
entirely
there
can
be
no
question
that
it
is
indeed
the
same
event
but
who
then
is
this
lady
whose
appearance
was
so
attractive
and
whose
end
was
so
horrible
for
answer
dacre
came
across
to
me
and
placed
the
small
lamp
upon
the
table
which
stood
by
my
bed
lifting
up
the
ill-omened
filler
he
turned
the
brass
rim
so
that
the
light
fell
full
upon
it
seen
in
this
way
the
engraving
seemed
clearer
than
on
the
night
before
we
have
already
agreed
that
this
is
the
badge
of
a
marquis
or
of
a
marquise
said
he
we
have
also
settled
that
the
last
letter
is
b
it
is
undoubtedly
so
i
now
suggest
to
you
that
the
other
letters
from
left
to
right
are
m
m
a
small
d
a
a
small
d
and
then
the
final
b
yes
i
am
sure
that
you
are
right
i
can
make
out
the
two
small
d's
quite
plainly
what
i
have
read
to
you
tonight
said
dacre
is
the
official
record
of
the
trial
of
marie
madeleine
d'aubray
marquise
de
brinvilliers
one
of
the
most
famous
poisoners
and
murderers
of
all
time
i
sat
in
silence
overwhelmed
at
the
extraordinary
nature
of
the
incident
and
at
the
completeness
of
the
proof
with
which
dacre
had
exposed
its
real
meaning
in
a
vague
way
i
remembered
some
details
of
the
woman's
career
her
unbridled
debauchery
the
cold-blooded
and
protracted
torture
of
her
sick
father
the
murder
of
her
brothers
for
motives
of
petty
gain
i
recollected
also
that
the
bravery
of
her
end
had
done
something
to
atone
for
the
horror
of
her
life
and
that
all
paris
had
sympathized
with
her
last
moments
and
blessed
her
as
a
martyr
within
a
few
days
of
the
time
when
they
had
cursed
her
as
a
murderess
one
objection
and
one
only
occurred
to
my
mind
how
came
her
initials
and
her
badge
of
rank
upon
the
filler
surely
they
did
not
carry
their
mediaeval
homage
to
the
nobility
to
the
point
of
decorating
instruments
of
torture
with
their
titles
i
was
puzzled
with
the
same
point
said
dacre
but
it
admits
of
a
simple
explanation
the
case
excited
extraordinary
interest
at
the
time
and
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
that
la
reynie
the
head
of
the
police
should
retain
this
filler
as
a
grim
souvenir
it
was
not
often
that
a
marchioness
of
france
underwent
the
extraordinary
question
that
he
should
engrave
her
initials
upon
it
for
the
information
of
others
was
surely
a
very
ordinary
proceeding
upon
his
part
and
this
i
asked
pointing
to
the
marks
upon
the
leathern
neck
she
was
a
cruel
tigress
said
dacre
as
he
turned
away
i
think
it
is
evident
that
like
other
tigresses
her
teeth
were
both
strong
and
sharp
the
new
catacomb
look
here
burger
said
kennedy
i
do
wish
that
you
would
confide
in
me
the
two
famous
students
of
roman
remains
sat
together
in
kennedy's
comfortable
room
overlooking
the
corso
the
night
was
cold
and
they
had
both
pulled
up
their
chairs
to
the
unsatisfactory
italian
stove
which
threw
out
a
zone
of
stuffiness
rather
than
of
warmth
outside
under
the
bright
winter
stars
lay
the
modern
rome
the
long
double
chain
of
the
electric
lamps
the
brilliantly
lighted
cafes
the
rushing
carriages
and
the
dense
throng
upon
the
footpaths
but
inside
in
the
sumptuous
chamber
of
the
rich
young
english
archaeologist
there
was
only
old
rome
to
be
seen
cracked
and
timeworn
friezes
hung
upon
the
walls
grey
old
busts
of
senators
and
soldiers
with
their
fighting
heads
and
their
hard
cruel
faces
peered
out
from
the
corners
on
the
centre
table
amidst
a
litter
of
inscriptions
fragments
and
ornaments
there
stood
the
famous
reconstruction
by
kennedy
of
the
baths
of
caracalla
which
excited
such
interest
and
admiration
when
it
was
exhibited
in
berlin
amphorae
hung
from
the
ceiling
and
a
litter
of
curiosities
strewed
the
rich
red
turkey
carpet
and
of
them
all
there
was
not
one
which
was
not
of
the
most
unimpeachable
authenticity
and
of
the
utmost
rarity
and
value
for
kennedy
though
little
more
than
thirty
had
a
european
reputation
in
this
particular
branch
of
research
and
was
moreover
provided
with
that
long
purse
which
either
proves
to
be
a
fatal
handicap
to
the
student's
energies
or
if
his
mind
is
still
true
to
its
purpose
gives
him
an
enormous
advantage
in
the
race
for
fame
kennedy
had
often
been
seduced
by
whim
and
pleasure
from
his
studies
but
his
mind
was
an
incisive
one
capable
of
long
and
concentrated
efforts
which
ended
in
sharp
reactions
of
sensuous
languor
his
handsome
face
with
its
high
white
forehead
its
aggressive
nose
and
its
somewhat
loose
and
sensual
mouth
was
a
fair
index
of
the
compromise
between
strength
and
weakness
in
his
nature
of
a
very
different
type
was
his
companion
julius
burger
he
came
of
a
curious
blend
a
german
father
and
an
italian
mother
with
the
robust
qualities
of
the
north
mingling
strangely
with
the
softer
graces
of
the
south
blue
teutonic
eyes
lightened
his
sun-browned
face
and
above
them
rose
a
square
massive
forehead
with
a
fringe
of
close
yellow
curls
lying
round
it
his
strong
firm
jaw
was
clean-shaven
and
his
companion
had
frequently
remarked
how
much
it
suggested
those
old
roman
busts
which
peered
out
from
the
shadows
in
the
corners
of
his
chamber
under
its
bluff
german
strength
there
lay
always
a
suggestion
of
italian
subtlety
but
the
smile
was
so
honest
and
the
eyes
so
frank
that
one
understood
that
this
was
only
an
indication
of
his
ancestry
with
no
actual
bearing
upon
his
character
in
age
and
in
reputation
he
was
on
the
same
level
as
his
english
companion
but
his
life
and
his
work
had
both
been
far
more
arduous
twelve
years
before
he
had
come
as
a
poor
student
to
rome
and
had
lived
ever
since
upon
some
small
endowment
for
research
which
had
been
awarded
to
him
by
the
university
of
bonn
painfully
slowly
and
doggedly
with
extraordinary
tenacity
and
single-mindedness
he
had
climbed
from
rung
to
rung
of
the
ladder
of
fame
until
now
he
was
a
member
of
the
berlin
academy
and
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
shortly
be
promoted
to
the
chair
of
the
greatest
of
german
universities
but
the
singleness
of
purpose
which
had
brought
him
to
the
same
high
level
as
the
rich
and
brilliant
englishman
had
caused
him
in
everything
outside
their
work
to
stand
infinitely
below
him
he
had
never
found
a
pause
in
his
studies
in
which
to
cultivate
the
social
graces
it
was
only
when
he
spoke
of
his
own
subject
that
his
face
was
filled
with
life
and
soul
at
other
times
he
was
silent
and
embarrassed
too
conscious
of
his
own
limitations
in
larger
subjects
and
impatient
of
that
small
talk
which
is
the
conventional
refuge
of
those
who
have
no
thoughts
to
express
and
yet
for
some
years
there
had
been
an
acquaintanceship
which
appeared
to
be
slowly
ripening
into
a
friendship
between
these
two
very
different
rivals
the
base
and
origin
of
this
lay
in
the
fact
that
in
their
own
studies
each
was
the
only
one
of
the
younger
men
who
had
knowledge
and
enthusiasm
enough
to
properly
appreciate
the
other
their
common
interests
and
pursuits
had
brought
them
together
and
each
had
been
attracted
by
the
other's
knowledge
and
then
gradually
something
had
been
added
to
this
kennedy
had
been
amused
by
the
frankness
and
simplicity
of
his
rival
while
burger
in
turn
had
been
fascinated
by
the
brilliancy
and
vivacity
which
had
made
kennedy
such
a
favourite
in
roman
society
i
say
had
because
just
at
the
moment
the
young
englishman
was
somewhat
under
a
cloud
a
love-affair
the
details
of
which
had
never
quite
come
out
had
indicated
a
heartlessness
and
callousness
upon
his
part
which
shocked
many
of
his
friends
but
in
the
bachelor
circles
of
students
and
artists
in
which
he
preferred
to
move
there
is
no
very
rigid
code
of
honour
in
such
matters
and
though
a
head
might
be
shaken
or
a
pair
of
shoulders
shrugged
over
the
flight
of
two
and
the
return
of
one
the
general
sentiment
was
probably
one
of
curiosity
and
perhaps
of
envy
rather
than
of
reprobation
look
here
burger
said
kennedy
looking
hard
at
the
placid
face
of
his
companion
i
do
wish
that
you
would
confide
in
me
as
he
spoke
he
waved
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
a
rug
which
lay
upon
the
floor
on
the
rug
stood
a
long
shallow
fruit-basket
of
the
light
wicker-work
which
is
used
in
the
campagna
and
this
was
heaped
with
a
litter
of
objects
inscribed
tiles
broken
inscriptions
cracked
mosaics
torn
papyri
rusty
metal
ornaments
which
to
the
uninitiated
might
have
seemed
to
have
come
straight
from
a
dustman's
bin
but
which
a
specialist
would
have
speedily
recognized
as
unique
of
their
kind
the
pile
of
odds
and
ends
in
the
flat
wicker-work
basket
supplied
exactly
one
of
those
missing
links
of
social
development
which
are
of
such
interest
to
the
student
it
was
the
german
who
had
brought
them
in
and
the
englishman's
eyes
were
hungry
as
he
looked
at
them
i
won't
interfere
with
your
treasure-trove
but
i
should
very
much
like
to
hear
about
it
he
continued
while
burger
very
deliberately
lit
a
cigar
it
is
evidently
a
discovery
of
the
first
importance
these
inscriptions
will
make
a
sensation
throughout
europe
for
every
one
here
there
are
a
million
there
said
the
german
there
are
so
many
that
a
dozen
savants
might
spend
a
lifetime
over
them
and
build
up
a
reputation
as
solid
as
the
castle
of
st
angelo
kennedy
sat
thinking
with
his
fine
forehead
wrinkled
and
his
fingers
playing
with
his
long
fair
moustache
you
have
given
yourself
away
burger
said
he
at
last
your
words
can
only
apply
to
one
thing
you
have
discovered
a
new
catacomb
i
had
no
doubt
that
you
had
already
come
to
that
conclusion
from
an
examination
of
these
objects
well
they
certainly
appeared
to
indicate
it
but
your
last
remarks
make
it
certain
there
is
no
place
except
a
catacomb
which
could
contain
so
vast
a
store
of
relics
as
you
describe
quite
so
there
is
no
mystery
about
that
i
have
discovered
a
new
catacomb
where
ah
that
is
my
secret
my
dear
kennedy
suffice
it
that
it
is
so
situated
that
there
is
not
one
chance
in
a
million
of
anyone
else
coming
upon
it
its
date
is
different
from
that
of
any
known
catacomb
and
it
has
been
reserved
for
the
burial
of
the
highest
christians
so
that
the
remains
and
the
relics
are
quite
different
from
anything
which
has
ever
been
seen
before
if
i
was
not
aware
of
your
knowledge
and
of
your
energy
my
friend
i
would
not
hesitate
under
the
pledge
of
secrecy
to
tell
you
everything
about
it
but
as
it
is
i
think
that
i
must
certainly
prepare
my
own
report
of
the
matter
before
i
expose
myself
to
such
formidable
competition
kennedy
loved
his
subject
with
a
love
which
was
almost
a
mania--a
love
which
held
him
true
to
it
amidst
all
the
distractions
which
come
to
a
wealthy
and
dissipated
young
man
he
had
ambition
but
his
ambition
was
secondary
to
his
mere
abstract
joy
and
interest
in
everything
which
concerned
the
old
life
and
history
of
the
city
he
yearned
to
see
this
new
underworld
which
his
companion
had
discovered
look
here
burger
said
he
earnestly
i
assure
you
that
you
can
trust
me
most
implicitly
in
the
matter
nothing
would
induce
me
to
put
pen
to
paper
about
anything
which
i
see
until
i
have
your
express
permission
i
quite
understand
your
feeling
and
i
think
it
is
most
natural
but
you
have
really
nothing
whatever
to
fear
from
me
on
the
other
hand
if
you
don't
tell
me
i
shall
make
a
systematic
search
and
i
shall
most
certainly
discover
it
in
that
case
of
course
i
should
make
what
use
i
liked
of
it
since
i
should
be
under
no
obligation
to
you
burger
smiled
thoughtfully
over
his
cigar
i
have
noticed
friend
kennedy
said
he
that
when
i
want
information
over
any
point
you
are
not
always
so
ready
to
supply
it
when
did
you
ever
ask
me
anything
that
i
did
not
tell
you
you
remember
for
example
my
giving
you
the
material
for
your
paper
about
the
temple
of
the
vestals
ah
well
that
was
not
a
matter
of
much
importance
if
i
were
to
question
you
upon
some
intimate
thing
would
you
give
me
an
answer
i
wonder
this
new
catacomb
is
a
very
intimate
thing
to
me
and
i
should
certainly
expect
some
sign
of
confidence
in
return
what
you
are
driving
at
i
cannot
imagine
said
the
englishman
but
if
you
mean
that
you
will
answer
my
question
about
the
catacomb
if
i
answer
any
question
which
you
may
put
to
me
i
can
assure
you
that
i
will
certainly
do
so
well
then
said
burger
leaning
luxuriously
back
in
his
settee
and
puffing
a
blue
tree
of
cigar-smoke
into
the
air
tell
me
all
about
your
relations
with
miss
mary
saunderson
kennedy
sprang
up
in
his
chair
and
glared
angrily
at
his
impassive
companion
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
he
cried
what
sort
of
a
question
is
this
you
may
mean
it
as
a
joke
but
you
never
made
a
worse
one
no
i
don't
mean
it
as
a
joke
said
burger
simply
i
am
really
rather
interested
in
the
details
of
the
matter
i
don't
know
much
about
the
world
and
women
and
social
life
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
such
an
incident
has
the
fascination
of
the
unknown
for
me
i
know
you
and
i
knew
her
by
sight--i
had
even
spoken
to
her
once
or
twice
i
should
very
much
like
to
hear
from
your
own
lips
exactly
what
it
was
which
occurred
between
you
i
won't
tell
you
a
word
that's
all
right
it
was
only
my
whim
to
see
if
you
would
give
up
a
secret
as
easily
as
you
expected
me
to
give
up
my
secret
of
the
new
catacomb
you
wouldn't
and
i
didn't
expect
you
to
but
why
should
you
expect
otherwise
of
me
there's
saint
john's
clock
striking
ten
it
is
quite
time
that
i
was
going
home
no
wait
a
bit
burger
said
kennedy
this
is
really
a
ridiculous
caprice
of
yours
to
wish
to
know
about
an
old
love-affair
which
has
burned
out
months
ago
you
know
we
look
upon
a
man
who
kisses
and
tells
as
the
greatest
coward
and
villain
possible
certainly
said
the
german
gathering
up
his
basket
of
curiosities
when
he
tells
anything
about
a
girl
which
is
previously
unknown
he
must
be
so
but
in
this
case
as
you
must
be
aware
it
was
a
public
matter
which
was
the
common
talk
of
rome
so
that
you
are
not
really
doing
miss
mary
saunderson
any
injury
by
discussing
her
case
with
me
but
still
i
respect
your
scruples
and
so
good
night
wait
a
bit
burger
said
kennedy
laying
his
hand
upon
the
other's
arm
i
am
very
keen
upon
this
catacomb
business
and
i
can't
let
it
drop
quite
so
easily
would
you
mind
asking
me
something
else
in
return--something
not
quite
so
eccentric
this
time
no
no
you
have
refused
and
there
is
an
end
of
it
said
burger
with
his
basket
on
his
arm
no
doubt
you
are
quite
right
not
to
answer
and
no
doubt
i
am
quite
right
also--and
so
again
my
dear
kennedy
good
night
the
englishman
watched
burger
cross
the
room
and
he
had
his
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
door
before
his
host
sprang
up
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
making
the
best
of
that
which
cannot
be
helped
hold
on
old
fellow
said
he
i
think
you
are
behaving
in
a
most
ridiculous
fashion
but
still
if
this
is
your
condition
i
suppose
that
i
must
submit
to
it
i
hate
saying
anything
about
a
girl
but
as
you
say
it
is
all
over
rome
and
i
don't
suppose
i
can
tell
you
anything
which
you
do
not
know
already
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
know
the
german
came
back
to
the
stove
and
laying
down
his
basket
he
sank
into
his
chair
once
more
may
i
have
another
cigar
said
he
thank
you
very
much
i
never
smoke
when
i
work
but
i
enjoy
a
chat
much
more
when
i
am
under
the
influence
of
tobacco
now
as
regards
this
young
lady
with
whom
you
had
this
little
adventure
what
in
the
world
has
become
of
her
she
is
at
home
with
her
own
people
oh
really--in
england
yes
what
part
of
england--london
no
twickenham
you
must
excuse
my
curiosity
my
dear
kennedy
and
you
must
put
it
down
to
my
ignorance
of
the
world
no
doubt
it
is
quite
a
simple
thing
to
persuade
a
young
lady
to
go
off
with
you
for
three
weeks
or
so
and
then
to
hand
her
over
to
her
own
family
at--what
did
you
call
the
place
twickenham
quite
so--at
twickenham
but
it
is
something
so
entirely
outside
my
own
experience
that
i
cannot
even
imagine
how
you
set
about
it
for
example
if
you
had
loved
this
girl
your
love
could
hardly
disappear
in
three
weeks
so
i
presume
that
you
could
not
have
loved
her
at
all
but
if
you
did
not
love
her
why
should
you
make
this
great
scandal
which
has
damaged
you
and
ruined
her
kennedy
looked
moodily
into
the
red
eye
of
the
stove
that's
a
logical
way
of
looking
at
it
certainly
said
he
love
is
a
big
word
and
it
represents
a
good
many
different
shades
of
feeling
i
liked
her
and--well
you
say
you've
seen
her--you
know
how
charming
she
could
look
but
still
i
am
willing
to
admit
looking
back
that
i
could
never
have
really
loved
her
then
my
dear
kennedy
why
did
you
do
it
the
adventure
of
the
thing
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
what
you
are
so
fond
of
adventures
where
would
the
variety
of
life
be
without
them
it
was
for
an
adventure
that
i
first
began
to
pay
my
attentions
to
her
i've
chased
a
good
deal
of
game
in
my
time
but
there's
no
chase
like
that
of
a
pretty
woman
there
was
the
piquant
difficulty
of
it
also
for
as
she
was
the
companion
of
lady
emily
rood
it
was
almost
impossible
to
see
her
alone
on
the
top
of
all
the
other
obstacles
which
attracted
me
i
learned
from
her
own
lips
very
early
in
the
proceedings
that
she
was
engaged
mein
gott
to
whom
she
mentioned
no
names
i
do
not
think
that
anyone
knows
that
so
that
made
the
adventure
more
alluring
did
it
well
it
did
certainly
give
a
spice
to
it
don't
you
think
so
i
tell
you
that
i
am
very
ignorant
about
these
things
my
dear
fellow
you
can
remember
that
the
apple
you
stole
from
your
neighbour's
tree
was
always
sweeter
than
that
which
fell
from
your
own
and
then
i
found
that
she
cared
for
me
what--at
once
oh
no
it
took
about
three
months
of
sapping
and
mining
but
at
last
i
won
her
over
she
understood
that
my
judicial
separation
from
my
wife
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
do
the
right
thing
by
her--but
she
came
all
the
same
and
we
had
a
delightful
time
as
long
as
it
lasted
but
how
about
the
other
man
kennedy
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
suppose
it
is
the
survival
of
the
fittest
said
he
if
he
had
been
the
better
man
she
would
not
have
deserted
him
let's
drop
the
subject
for
i
have
had
enough
of
it
only
one
other
thing
how
did
you
get
rid
of
her
in
three
weeks
well
we
had
both
cooled
down
a
bit
you
understand
she
absolutely
refused
under
any
circumstances
to
come
back
to
face
the
people
she
had
known
in
rome
now
of
course
rome
is
necessary
to
me
and
i
was
already
pining
to
be
back
at
my
work--so
there
was
one
obvious
cause
of
separation
then
again
her
old
father
turned
up
at
the
hotel
in
london
and
there
was
a
scene
and
the
whole
thing
became
so
unpleasant
that
really--though
i
missed
her
dreadfully
at
first--i
was
very
glad
to
slip
out
of
it
now
i
rely
upon
you
not
to
repeat
anything
of
what
i
have
said
my
dear
kennedy
i
should
not
dream
of
repeating
it
but
all
that
you
say
interests
me
very
much
for
it
gives
me
an
insight
into
your
way
of
looking
at
things
which
is
entirely
different
from
mine
for
i
have
seen
so
little
of
life
and
now
you
want
to
know
about
my
new
catacomb
there's
no
use
my
trying
to
describe
it
for
you
would
never
find
it
by
that
there
is
only
one
thing
and
that
is
for
me
to
take
you
there
that
would
be
splendid
when
would
you
like
to
come
the
sooner
the
better
i
am
all
impatience
to
see
it
well
it
is
a
beautiful
night--though
a
trifle
cold
suppose
we
start
in
an
hour
we
must
be
very
careful
to
keep
the
matter
to
ourselves
if
anyone
saw
us
hunting
in
couples
they
would
suspect
that
there
was
something
going
on
we
can't
be
too
cautious
said
kennedy
is
it
far
some
miles
not
too
far
to
walk
oh
no
we
could
walk
there
easily
we
had
better
do
so
then
a
cabman's
suspicions
would
be
aroused
if
he
dropped
us
both
at
some
lonely
spot
in
the
dead
of
the
night
quite
so
i
think
it
would
be
best
for
us
to
meet
at
the
gate
of
the
appian
way
at
midnight
i
must
go
back
to
my
lodgings
for
the
matches
and
candles
and
things
all
right
burger
i
think
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
let
me
into
this
secret
and
i
promise
you
that
i
will
write
nothing
about
it
until
you
have
published
your
report
good-bye
for
the
present
you
will
find
me
at
the
gate
at
twelve
the
cold
clear
air
was
filled
with
the
musical
chimes
from
that
city
of
clocks
as
burger
wrapped
in
an
italian
overcoat
with
a
lantern
hanging
from
his
hand
walked
up
to
the
rendezvous
kennedy
stepped
out
of
the
shadow
to
meet
him
you
are
ardent
in
work
as
well
as
in
love
said
the
german
laughing
yes
i
have
been
waiting
here
for
nearly
half
an
hour
i
hope
you
left
no
clue
as
to
where
we
were
going
not
such
a
fool
by
jove
i
am
chilled
to
the
bone
come
on
burger
let
us
warm
ourselves
by
a
spurt
of
hard
walking
their
footsteps
sounded
loud
and
crisp
upon
the
rough
stone
paving
of
the
disappointing
road
which
is
all
that
is
left
of
the
most
famous
highway
of
the
world
a
peasant
or
two
going
home
from
the
wine-shop
and
a
few
carts
of
country
produce
coming
up
to
rome
were
the
only
things
which
they
met
they
swung
along
with
the
huge
tombs
looming
up
through
the
darkness
upon
each
side
of
them
until
they
had
come
as
far
as
the
catacombs
of
st
calistus
and
saw
against
a
rising
moon
the
great
circular
bastion
of
cecilia
metella
in
front
of
them
then
burger
stopped
with
his
hand
to
his
side
your
legs
are
longer
than
mine
and
you
are
more
accustomed
to
walking
said
he
laughing
i
think
that
the
place
where
we
turn
off
is
somewhere
here
yes
this
is
it
round
the
corner
of
the
trattoria
now
it
is
a
very
narrow
path
so
perhaps
i
had
better
go
in
front
and
you
can
follow
he
had
lit
his
lantern
and
by
its
light
they
were
enabled
to
follow
a
narrow
and
devious
track
which
wound
across
the
marshes
of
the
campagna
the
great
aqueduct
of
old
rome
lay
like
a
monstrous
caterpillar
across
the
moonlit
landscape
and
their
road
led
them
under
one
of
its
huge
arches
and
past
the
circle
of
crumbling
bricks
which
marks
the
old
arena
at
last
burger
stopped
at
a
solitary
wooden
cow-house
and
he
drew
a
key
from
his
pocket
surely
your
catacomb
is
not
inside
a
house
cried
kennedy
the
entrance
to
it
is
that
is
just
the
safeguard
which
we
have
against
anyone
else
discovering
it
does
the
proprietor
know
of
it
not
he
he
had
found
one
or
two
objects
which
made
me
almost
certain
that
his
house
was
built
on
the
entrance
to
such
a
place
so
i
rented
it
from
him
and
did
my
excavations
for
myself
come
in
and
shut
the
door
behind
you
it
was
a
long
empty
building
with
the
mangers
of
the
cows
along
one
wall
burger
put
his
lantern
down
on
the
ground
and
shaded
its
light
in
all
directions
save
one
by
draping
his
overcoat
round
it
it
might
excite
remark
if
anyone
saw
a
light
in
this
lonely
place
said
he
just
help
me
to
move
this
boarding
the
flooring
was
loose
in
the
corner
and
plank
by
plank
the
two
savants
raised
it
and
leaned
it
against
the
wall
below
there
was
a
square
aperture
and
a
stair
of
old
stone
steps
which
led
away
down
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
be
careful
cried
burger
as
kennedy
in
his
impatience
hurried
down
them
it
is
a
perfect
rabbits'-warren
below
and
if
you
were
once
to
lose
your
way
there
the
chances
would
be
a
hundred
to
one
against
your
ever
coming
out
again
wait
until
i
bring
the
light
how
do
you
find
your
own
way
if
it
is
so
complicated
i
had
some
very
narrow
escapes
at
first
but
i
have
gradually
learned
to
go
about
there
is
a
certain
system
to
it
but
it
is
one
which
a
lost
man
if
he
were
in
the
dark
could
not
possibly
find
out
even
now
i
always
spin
out
a
ball
of
string
behind
me
when
i
am
going
far
into
the
catacomb
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
it
is
difficult
but
every
one
of
these
passages
divides
and
subdivides
a
dozen
times
before
you
go
a
hundred
yards
they
had
descended
some
twenty
feet
from
the
level
of
the
byre
and
they
were
standing
now
in
a
square
chamber
cut
out
of
the
soft
tufa
the
lantern
cast
a
flickering
light
bright
below
and
dim
above
over
the
cracked
brown
walls
in
every
direction
were
the
black
openings
of
passages
which
radiated
from
this
common
centre
i
want
you
to
follow
me
closely
my
friend
said
burger
do
not
loiter
to
look
at
anything
upon
the
way
for
the
place
to
which
i
will
take
you
contains
all
that
you
can
see
and
more
it
will
save
time
for
us
to
go
there
direct
he
led
the
way
down
one
of
the
corridors
and
the
englishman
followed
closely
at
his
heels
every
now
and
then
the
passage
bifurcated
but
burger
was
evidently
following
some
secret
marks
of
his
own
for
he
neither
stopped
nor
hesitated
everywhere
along
the
walls
packed
like
the
berths
upon
an
emigrant
ship
lay
the
christians
of
old
rome
the
yellow
light
flickered
over
the
shrivelled
features
of
the
mummies
and
gleamed
upon
rounded
skulls
and
long
white
armbones
crossed
over
fleshless
chests
and
everywhere
as
he
passed
kennedy
looked
with
wistful
eyes
upon
inscriptions
funeral
vessels
pictures
vestments
utensils
all
lying
as
pious
hands
had
placed
them
so
many
centuries
ago
it
was
apparent
to
him
even
in
those
hurried
passing
glances
that
this
was
the
earliest
and
finest
of
the
catacombs
containing
such
a
storehouse
of
roman
remains
as
had
never
before
come
at
one
time
under
the
observation
of
the
student
what
would
happen
if
the
light
went
out
he
asked
as
they
hurried
onwards
i
have
a
spare
candle
and
a
box
of
matches
in
my
pocket
by
the
way
kennedy
have
you
any
matches
no
you
had
better
give
me
some
oh
that
is
all
right
there
is
no
chance
of
our
separating
how
far
are
we
going
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
walked
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
mile
more
than
that
i
think
there
is
really
no
limit
to
the
tombs--at
least
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
any
this
is
a
very
difficult
place
so
i
think
that
i
will
use
our
ball
of
string
he
fastened
one
end
of
it
to
a
projecting
stone
and
he
carried
the
coil
in
the
breast
of
his
coat
paying
it
out
as
he
advanced
kennedy
saw
that
it
was
no
unnecessary
precaution
for
the
passages
had
become
more
complex
and
tortuous
than
ever
with
a
perfect
network
of
intersecting
corridors
but
these
all
ended
in
one
large
circular
hall
with
a
square
pedestal
of
tufa
topped
with
a
slab
of
marble
at
one
end
of
it
by
jove
cried
kennedy
in
an
ecstasy
as
burger
swung
his
lantern
over
the
marble
it
is
a
christian
altar--probably
the
first
one
in
existence
here
is
the
little
consecration
cross
cut
upon
the
corner
of
it
no
doubt
this
circular
space
was
used
as
a
church
precisely
said
burger
if
i
had
more
time
i
should
like
to
show
you
all
the
bodies
which
are
buried
in
these
niches
upon
the
walls
for
they
are
the
early
popes
and
bishops
of
the
church
with
their
mitres
their
croziers
and
full
canonicals
go
over
to
that
one
and
look
at
it
kennedy
went
across
and
stared
at
the
ghastly
head
which
lay
loosely
on
the
shredded
and
mouldering
mitre
this
is
most
interesting
said
he
and
his
voice
seemed
to
boom
against
the
concave
vault
as
far
as
my
experience
goes
it
is
unique
bring
the
lantern
over
burger
for
i
want
to
see
them
all
but
the
german
had
strolled
away
and
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
yellow
circle
of
light
at
the
other
side
of
the
hall
do
you
know
how
many
wrong
turnings
there
are
between
this
and
the
stairs
he
asked
there
are
over
two
thousand
no
doubt
it
was
one
of
the
means
of
protection
which
the
christians
adopted
the
odds
are
two
thousand
to
one
against
a
man
getting
out
even
if
he
had
a
light
but
if
he
were
in
the
dark
it
would
of
course
be
far
more
difficult
so
i
should
think
and
the
darkness
is
something
dreadful
i
tried
it
once
for
an
experiment
let
us
try
it
again
he
stooped
to
the
lantern
and
in
an
instant
it
was
as
if
an
invisible
hand
was
squeezed
tightly
over
each
of
kennedy's
eyes
never
had
he
known
what
such
darkness
was
it
seemed
to
press
upon
him
and
to
smother
him
it
was
a
solid
obstacle
against
which
the
body
shrank
from
advancing
he
put
his
hands
out
to
push
it
back
from
him
that
will
do
burger
said
he
let's
have
the
light
again
but
his
companion
began
to
laugh
and
in
that
circular
room
the
sound
seemed
to
come
from
every
side
at
once
you
seem
uneasy
friend
kennedy
said
he
go
on
man
light
the
candle
said
kennedy
impatiently
it's
very
strange
kennedy
but
i
could
not
in
the
least
tell
by
the
sound
in
which
direction
you
stand
could
you
tell
where
i
am
no
you
seem
to
be
on
every
side
of
me
if
it
were
not
for
this
string
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
i
should
not
have
a
notion
which
way
to
go
i
dare
say
not
strike
a
light
man
and
have
an
end
of
this
nonsense
well
kennedy
there
are
two
things
which
i
understand
that
you
are
very
fond
of
the
one
is
an
adventure
and
the
other
is
an
obstacle
to
surmount
the
adventure
must
be
the
finding
of
your
way
out
of
this
catacomb
the
obstacle
will
be
the
darkness
and
the
two
thousand
wrong
turns
which
make
the
way
a
little
difficult
to
find
but
you
need
not
hurry
for
you
have
plenty
of
time
and
when
you
halt
for
a
rest
now
and
then
i
should
like
you
just
to
think
of
miss
mary
saunderson
and
whether
you
treated
her
quite
fairly
you
devil
what
do
you
mean
roared
kennedy
he
was
running
about
in
little
circles
and
clasping
at
the
solid
blackness
with
both
hands
good-bye
said
the
mocking
voice
and
it
was
already
at
some
distance
i
really
do
not
think
kennedy
even
by
your
own
showing
that
you
did
the
right
thing
by
that
girl
there
was
only
one
little
thing
which
you
appeared
not
to
know
and
i
can
supply
it
miss
saunderson
was
engaged
to
a
poor
ungainly
devil
of
a
student
and
his
name
was
julius
burger
there
was
a
rustle
somewhere
the
vague
sound
of
a
foot
striking
a
stone
and
then
there
fell
silence
upon
that
old
christian
church--a
stagnant
heavy
silence
which
closed
round
kennedy
and
shut
him
in
like
water
round
a
drowning
man
some
two
months
afterwards
the
following
paragraph
made
the
round
of
the
european
press
one
of
the
most
interesting
discoveries
of
recent
years
is
that
of
the
new
catacomb
in
rome
which
lies
some
distance
to
the
east
of
the
well-known
vaults
of
st
calixtus
the
finding
of
this
important
burial-place
which
is
exceeding
rich
in
most
interesting
early
christian
remains
is
due
to
the
energy
and
sagacity
of
dr
julius
burger
the
young
german
specialist
who
is
rapidly
taking
the
first
place
as
an
authority
upon
ancient
rome
although
the
first
to
publish
his
discovery
it
appears
that
a
less
fortunate
adventurer
had
anticipated
dr
burger
some
months
ago
mr
kennedy
the
well-known
english
student
disappeared
suddenly
from
his
rooms
in
the
corso
and
it
was
conjectured
that
his
association
with
a
recent
scandal
had
driven
him
to
leave
rome
it
appears
now
that
he
had
in
reality
fallen
a
victim
to
that
fervid
love
of
archaeology
which
had
raised
him
to
a
distinguished
place
among
living
scholars
his
body
was
discovered
in
the
heart
of
the
new
catacomb
and
it
was
evident
from
the
condition
of
his
feet
and
boots
that
he
had
tramped
for
days
through
the
tortuous
corridors
which
make
these
subterranean
tombs
so
dangerous
to
explorers
the
deceased
gentleman
had
with
inexplicable
rashness
made
his
way
into
this
labyrinth
without
as
far
as
can
be
discovered
taking
with
him
either
candles
or
matches
so
that
his
sad
fate
was
the
natural
result
of
his
own
temerity
what
makes
the
matter
more
painful
is
that
dr
julius
burger
was
an
intimate
friend
of
the
deceased
his
joy
at
the
extraordinary
find
which
he
has
been
so
fortunate
as
to
make
has
been
greatly
marred
by
the
terrible
fate
of
his
comrade
and
fellow-worker
the
case
of
lady
sannox
the
relations
between
douglas
stone
and
the
notorious
lady
sannox
were
very
well
known
both
among
the
fashionable
circles
of
which
she
was
a
brilliant
member
and
the
scientific
bodies
which
numbered
him
among
their
most
illustrious
confreres
there
was
naturally
therefore
a
very
widespread
interest
when
it
was
announced
one
morning
that
the
lady
had
absolutely
and
for
ever
taken
the
veil
and
that
the
world
would
see
her
no
more
when
at
the
very
tail
of
this
rumour
there
came
the
assurance
that
the
celebrated
operating
surgeon
the
man
of
steel
nerves
had
been
found
in
the
morning
by
his
valet
seated
on
one
side
of
his
bed
smiling
pleasantly
upon
the
universe
with
both
legs
jammed
into
one
side
of
his
breeches
and
his
great
brain
about
as
valuable
as
a
cap
full
of
porridge
the
matter
was
strong
enough
to
give
quite
a
little
thrill
of
interest
to
folk
who
had
never
hoped
that
their
jaded
nerves
were
capable
of
such
a
sensation
douglas
stone
in
his
prime
was
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
in
england
indeed
he
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
ever
reached
his
prime
for
he
was
but
nine-and-thirty
at
the
time
of
this
little
incident
those
who
knew
him
best
were
aware
that
famous
as
he
was
as
a
surgeon
he
might
have
succeeded
with
even
greater
rapidity
in
any
of
a
dozen
lines
of
life
he
could
have
cut
his
way
to
fame
as
a
soldier
struggled
to
it
as
an
explorer
bullied
for
it
in
the
courts
or
built
it
out
of
stone
and
iron
as
an
engineer
he
was
born
to
be
great
for
he
could
plan
what
another
man
dare
not
do
and
he
could
do
what
another
man
dare
not
plan
in
surgery
none
could
follow
him
his
nerve
his
judgement
his
intuition
were
things
apart
again
and
again
his
knife
cut
away
death
but
grazed
the
very
springs
of
life
in
doing
it
until
his
assistants
were
as
white
as
the
patient
his
energy
his
audacity
his
full-blooded
self-confidence--does
not
the
memory
of
them
still
linger
to
the
south
of
marylebone
road
and
the
north
of
oxford
street
his
vices
were
as
magnificent
as
his
virtues
and
infinitely
more
picturesque
large
as
was
his
income
and
it
was
the
third
largest
of
all
professional
men
in
london
it
was
far
beneath
the
luxury
of
his
living
deep
in
his
complex
nature
lay
a
rich
vein
of
sensualism
at
the
sport
of
which
he
placed
all
the
prizes
of
his
life
the
eye
the
ear
the
touch
the
palate
all
were
his
masters
the
bouquet
of
old
vintages
the
scent
of
rare
exotics
the
curves
and
tints
of
the
daintiest
potteries
of
europe
it
was
to
these
that
the
quick-running
stream
of
gold
was
transformed
and
then
there
came
his
sudden
mad
passion
for
lady
sannox
when
a
single
interview
with
two
challenging
glances
and
a
whispered
word
set
him
ablaze
she
was
the
loveliest
woman
in
london
and
the
only
one
to
him
he
was
one
of
the
handsomest
men
in
london
but
not
the
only
one
to
her
she
had
a
liking
for
new
experiences
and
was
gracious
to
most
men
who
wooed
her
it
may
have
been
cause
or
it
may
have
been
effect
that
lord
sannox
looked
fifty
though
he
was
but
six-and-thirty
he
was
a
quiet
silent
neutral-tinted
man
this
lord
with
thin
lips
and
heavy
eyelids
much
given
to
gardening
and
full
of
home-like
habits
he
had
at
one
time
been
fond
of
acting
had
even
rented
a
theatre
in
london
and
on
its
boards
had
first
seen
miss
marion
dawson
to
whom
he
had
offered
his
hand
his
title
and
the
third
of
a
county
since
his
marriage
his
early
hobby
had
become
distasteful
to
him
even
in
private
theatricals
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
persuade
him
to
exercise
the
talent
which
he
had
often
showed
that
he
possessed
he
was
happier
with
a
spud
and
a
watering-can
among
his
orchids
and
chrysanthemums
it
was
quite
an
interesting
problem
whether
he
was
absolutely
devoid
of
sense
or
miserably
wanting
in
spirit
did
he
know
his
lady's
ways
and
condone
them
or
was
he
a
mere
blind
doting
fool
it
was
a
point
to
be
discussed
over
the
teacups
in
snug
little
drawing-rooms
or
with
the
aid
of
a
cigar
in
the
bow
windows
of
clubs
bitter
and
plain
were
the
comments
among
men
upon
his
conduct
there
was
but
one
who
had
a
good
word
to
say
for
him
and
he
was
the
most
silent
member
in
the
smoking-room
he
had
seen
him
break
in
a
horse
at
the
university
and
it
seemed
to
have
left
an
impression
upon
his
mind
but
when
douglas
stone
became
the
favourite
all
doubts
as
to
lord
sannox's
knowledge
or
ignorance
were
set
for
ever
at
rest
there
was
no
subterfuge
about
stone
in
his
high-handed
impetuous
fashion
he
set
all
caution
and
discretion
at
defiance
the
scandal
became
notorious
a
learned
body
intimated
that
his
name
had
been
struck
from
the
list
of
its
vice-presidents
two
friends
implored
him
to
consider
his
professional
credit
he
cursed
them
all
three
and
spent
forty
guineas
on
a
bangle
to
take
with
him
to
the
lady
he
was
at
her
house
every
evening
and
she
drove
in
his
carriage
in
the
afternoons
there
was
not
an
attempt
on
either
side
to
conceal
their
relations
but
there
came
at
last
a
little
incident
to
interrupt
them
it
was
a
dismal
winter's
night
very
cold
and
gusty
with
the
wind
whooping
in
the
chimneys
and
blustering
against
the
window-panes
a
thin
spatter
of
rain
tinkled
on
the
glass
with
each
fresh
sough
of
the
gale
drowning
for
the
instant
the
dull
gurgle
and
drip
from
the
eaves
douglas
stone
had
finished
his
dinner
and
sat
by
his
fire
in
the
study
a
glass
of
rich
port
upon
the
malachite
table
at
his
elbow
as
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
he
held
it
up
against
the
lamplight
and
watched
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
the
tiny
scales
of
beeswing
which
floated
in
its
rich
ruby
depths
the
fire
as
it
spurted
up
threw
fitful
lights
upon
his
bald
clear-cut
face
with
its
widely-opened
grey
eyes
its
thick
and
yet
firm
lips
and
the
deep
square
jaw
which
had
something
roman
in
its
strength
and
its
animalism
he
smiled
from
time
to
time
as
he
nestled
back
in
his
luxurious
chair
indeed
he
had
a
right
to
feel
well
pleased
for
against
the
advice
of
six
colleagues
he
had
performed
an
operation
that
day
of
which
only
two
cases
were
on
record
and
the
result
had
been
brilliant
beyond
all
expectation
no
other
man
in
london
would
have
had
the
daring
to
plan
or
the
skill
to
execute
such
a
heroic
measure
but
he
had
promised
lady
sannox
to
see
her
that
evening
and
it
was
already
half-past
eight
his
hand
was
outstretched
to
the
bell
to
order
the
carriage
when
he
heard
the
dull
thud
of
the
knocker
an
instant
later
there
was
the
shuffling
of
feet
in
the
hall
and
the
sharp
closing
of
a
door
a
patient
to
see
you
sir
in
the
consulting
room
said
the
butler
about
himself
no
sir
i
think
he
wants
you
to
go
out
it
is
too
late
cried
douglas
stone
peevishly
i
won't
go
this
is
his
card
sir
the
butler
presented
it
upon
the
gold
salver
which
had
been
given
to
his
master
by
the
wife
of
a
prime
minister
'hamil
ali
smyrna'
hum
the
fellow
is
a
turk
i
suppose
yes
sir
he
seems
as
if
he
came
from
abroad
sir
and
he's
in
a
terrible
way
tut
tut
i
have
an
engagement
i
must
go
somewhere
else
but
i'll
see
him
show
him
in
here
pim
a
few
moments
later
the
butler
swung
open
the
door
and
ushered
in
a
small
and
decrepit
man
who
walked
with
a
bent
back
and
with
the
forward
push
of
the
face
and
blink
of
the
eyes
which
goes
with
extreme
short
sight
his
face
was
swarthy
and
his
hair
and
beard
of
the
deepest
black
in
one
hand
he
held
a
turban
of
white
muslin
striped
with
red
in
the
other
a
small
chamois-leather
bag
good
evening
said
douglas
stone
when
the
butler
had
closed
the
door
you
speak
english
i
presume
yes
sir
i
am
from
asia
minor
but
i
speak
english
when
i
speak
slow
you
wanted
me
to
go
out
i
understand
yes
sir
i
wanted
very
much
that
you
should
see
my
wife
i
could
come
in
the
morning
but
i
have
an
engagement
which
prevents
me
from
seeing
your
wife
tonight
the
turk's
answer
was
a
singular
one
he
pulled
the
string
which
closed
the
mouth
of
the
chamois-leather
bag
and
poured
a
flood
of
gold
on
to
the
table
there
are
one
hundred
pounds
there
said
he
and
i
promise
you
that
it
will
not
take
you
an
hour
i
have
a
cab
ready
at
the
door
douglas
stone
glanced
at
his
watch
an
hour
would
not
make
it
too
late
to
visit
lady
sannox
he
had
been
there
later
and
the
fee
was
an
extraordinarily
high
one
he
had
been
pressed
by
his
creditors
lately
and
he
could
not
afford
to
let
such
a
chance
pass
he
would
go
what
is
the
case
he
asked
oh
it
is
so
sad
a
one
so
sad
a
one
you
have
not
perhaps
heard
of
the
daggers
of
the
almohades
never
ah
they
are
eastern
daggers
of
a
great
age
and
of
a
singular
shape
with
the
hilt
like
what
you
call
a
stirrup
i
am
a
curiosity
dealer
you
understand
and
that
is
why
i
have
come
to
england
from
smyrna
but
next
week
i
go
back
once
more
many
things
i
brought
with
me
and
i
have
a
few
things
left
but
among
them
to
my
sorrow
is
one
of
these
daggers
you
will
remember
that
i
have
an
appointment
sir
said
the
surgeon
with
some
irritation
pray
confine
yourself
to
the
necessary
details
you
will
see
that
it
is
necessary
today
my
wife
fell
down
in
a
faint
in
the
room
in
which
i
keep
my
wares
and
she
cut
her
lower
lip
upon
this
cursed
dagger
of
almohades
i
see
said
douglas
stone
rising
and
you
wish
me
to
dress
the
wound
no
no
it
is
worse
than
that
what
then
these
daggers
are
poisoned
poisoned
yes
and
there
is
no
man
east
or
west
who
can
tell
now
what
is
the
poison
or
what
the
cure
but
all
that
is
known
i
know
for
my
father
was
in
this
trade
before
me
and
we
have
had
much
to
do
with
these
poisoned
weapons
what
are
the
symptoms
deep
sleep
and
death
in
thirty
hours
and
you
say
there
is
no
cure
why
then
should
you
pay
me
this
considerable
fee
no
drug
can
cure
but
the
knife
may
and
how
the
poison
is
slow
of
absorption
it
remains
for
hours
in
the
wound
washing
then
might
cleanse
it
no
more
than
in
a
snake
bite
it
is
too
subtle
and
too
deadly
excision
of
the
wound
then
that
is
it
if
it
be
on
the
finger
take
the
finger
off
so
said
my
father
always
but
think
of
where
this
wound
is
and
that
it
is
my
wife
it
is
dreadful
but
familiarity
with
such
grim
matters
may
take
the
finer
edge
from
a
man's
sympathy
to
douglas
stone
this
was
already
an
interesting
case
and
he
brushed
aside
as
irrelevant
the
feeble
objections
of
the
husband
it
appears
to
be
that
or
nothing
said
he
brusquely
it
is
better
to
lose
a
lip
than
a
life
ah
yes
i
know
that
you
are
right
well
well
it
is
kismet
and
it
must
be
faced
i
have
the
cab
and
you
will
come
with
me
and
do
this
thing
douglas
stone
took
his
case
of
bistouries
from
a
drawer
and
placed
it
with
a
roll
of
bandage
and
a
compress
of
lint
in
his
pocket
he
must
waste
no
more
time
if
he
were
to
see
lady
sannox
i
am
ready
said
he
pulling
on
his
overcoat
will
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
before
you
go
out
into
this
cold
air
his
visitor
shrank
away
with
a
protesting
hand
upraised
you
forget
that
i
am
a
mussulman
and
a
true
follower
of
the
prophet
said
he
but
tell
me
what
is
the
bottle
of
green
glass
which
you
have
placed
in
your
pocket
it
is
chloroform
ah
that
also
is
forbidden
to
us
it
is
a
spirit
and
we
make
no
use
of
such
things
what
you
would
allow
your
wife
to
go
through
an
operation
without
an
anaesthetic
ah
she
will
feel
nothing
poor
soul
the
deep
sleep
has
already
come
on
which
is
the
first
working
of
the
poison
and
then
i
have
given
her
of
our
smyrna
opium
come
sir
for
already
an
hour
has
passed
as
they
stepped
out
into
the
darkness
a
sheet
of
rain
was
driven
in
upon
their
faces
and
the
hall
lamp
which
dangled
from
the
arm
of
a
marble
caryatid
went
out
with
a
fluff
pim
the
butler
pushed
the
heavy
door
to
straining
hard
with
his
shoulder
against
the
wind
while
the
two
men
groped
their
way
towards
the
yellow
glare
which
showed
where
the
cab
was
waiting
an
instant
later
they
were
rattling
upon
their
journey
is
it
far
asked
douglas
stone
oh
no
we
have
a
very
little
quiet
place
off
the
euston
road
the
surgeon
pressed
the
spring
of
his
repeater
and
listened
to
the
little
tings
which
told
him
the
hour
it
was
a
quarter
past
nine
he
calculated
the
distances
and
the
short
time
which
it
would
take
him
to
perform
so
trivial
an
operation
he
ought
to
reach
lady
sannox
by
ten
o'clock
through
the
fogged
windows
he
saw
the
blurred
gas
lamps
dancing
past
with
occasionally
the
broader
glare
of
a
shop
front
the
rain
was
pelting
and
rattling
upon
the
leathern
top
of
the
carriage
and
the
wheels
swashed
as
they
rolled
through
puddle
and
mud
opposite
to
him
the
white
headgear
of
his
companion
gleamed
faintly
through
the
obscurity
the
surgeon
felt
in
his
pockets
and
arranged
his
needles
his
ligatures
and
his
safety-pins
that
no
time
might
be
wasted
when
they
arrived
he
chafed
with
impatience
and
drummed
his
foot
upon
the
floor
but
the
cab
slowed
down
at
last
and
pulled
up
in
an
instant
douglas
stone
was
out
and
the
smyrna
merchant's
toe
was
at
his
very
heel
you
can
wait
said
he
to
the
driver
it
was
a
mean-looking
house
in
a
narrow
and
sordid
street
the
surgeon
who
knew
his
london
well
cast
a
swift
glance
into
the
shadows
but
there
was
nothing
distinctive--no
shop
no
movement
nothing
but
a
double
line
of
dull
flat-faced
houses
a
double
stretch
of
wet
flagstones
which
gleamed
in
the
lamplight
and
a
double
rush
of
water
in
the
gutters
which
swirled
and
gurgled
towards
the
sewer
gratings
the
door
which
faced
them
was
blotched
and
discoloured
and
a
faint
light
in
the
fan
pane
above
it
served
to
show
the
dust
and
the
grime
which
covered
it
above
in
one
of
the
bedroom
windows
there
was
a
dull
yellow
glimmer
the
merchant
knocked
loudly
and
as
he
turned
his
dark
face
towards
the
light
douglas
stone
could
see
that
it
was
contracted
with
anxiety
a
bolt
was
drawn
and
an
elderly
woman
with
a
taper
stood
in
the
doorway
shielding
the
thin
flame
with
her
gnarled
hand
is
all
well
gasped
the
merchant
she
is
as
you
left
her
sir
she
has
not
spoken
no
she
is
in
a
deep
sleep
the
merchant
closed
the
door
and
douglas
stone
walked
down
the
narrow
passage
glancing
about
him
in
some
surprise
as
he
did
so
there
was
no
oil-cloth
no
mat
no
hat-rack
deep
grey
dust
and
heavy
festoons
of
cobwebs
met
his
eyes
everywhere
following
the
old
woman
up
the
winding
stair
his
firm
footfall
echoed
harshly
through
the
silent
house
there
was
no
carpet
the
bedroom
was
on
the
second
landing
douglas
stone
followed
the
old
nurse
into
it
with
the
merchant
at
his
heels
here
at
least
there
was
furniture
and
to
spare
the
floor
was
littered
and
the
corners
piled
with
turkish
cabinets
inlaid
tables
coats
of
chain
mail
strange
pipes
and
grotesque
weapons
a
single
small
lamp
stood
upon
a
bracket
on
the
wall
douglas
stone
took
it
down
and
picking
his
way
among
the
lumber
walked
over
to
a
couch
in
the
corner
on
which
lay
a
woman
dressed
in
the
turkish
fashion
with
yashmak
and
veil
the
lower
part
of
the
face
was
exposed
and
the
surgeon
saw
a
jagged
cut
which
zigzagged
along
the
border
of
the
under
lip
you
will
forgive
the
yashmak
said
the
turk
you
know
our
views
about
women
in
the
east
but
the
surgeon
was
not
thinking
about
the
yashmak
this
was
no
longer
a
woman
to
him
it
was
a
case
he
stooped
and
examined
the
wound
carefully
there
are
no
signs
of
irritation
said
he
we
might
delay
the
operation
until
local
symptoms
develop
the
husband
wrung
his
hands
in
uncontrollable
agitation
oh
sir
sir
he
cried
do
not
trifle
you
do
not
know
it
is
deadly
i
know
and
i
give
you
my
assurance
that
an
operation
is
absolutely
necessary
only
the
knife
can
save
her
and
yet
i
am
inclined
to
wait
said
douglas
stone
that
is
enough
the
turk
cried
angrily
every
minute
is
of
importance
and
i
cannot
stand
here
and
see
my
wife
allowed
to
sink
it
only
remains
for
me
to
give
you
my
thanks
for
having
come
and
to
call
in
some
other
surgeon
before
it
is
too
late
douglas
stone
hesitated
to
refund
that
hundred
pounds
was
no
pleasant
matter
but
of
course
if
he
left
the
case
he
must
return
the
money
and
if
the
turk
were
right
and
the
woman
died
his
position
before
a
coroner
might
be
an
embarrassing
one
you
have
had
personal
experience
of
this
poison
he
asked
i
have
and
you
assure
me
that
an
operation
is
needful
i
swear
it
by
all
that
i
hold
sacred
the
disfigurement
will
be
frightful
i
can
understand
that
the
mouth
will
not
be
a
pretty
one
to
kiss
douglas
stone
turned
fiercely
upon
the
man
the
speech
was
a
brutal
one
but
the
turk
has
his
own
fashion
of
talk
and
of
thought
and
there
was
no
time
for
wrangling
douglas
stone
drew
a
bistoury
from
his
case
opened
it
and
felt
the
keen
straight
edge
with
his
forefinger
then
he
held
the
lamp
closer
to
the
bed
two
dark
eyes
were
gazing
up
at
him
through
the
slit
in
the
yashmak
they
were
all
iris
and
the
pupil
was
hardly
to
be
seen
you
have
given
her
a
very
heavy
dose
of
opium
yes
she
has
had
a
good
dose
he
glanced
again
at
the
dark
eyes
which
looked
straight
at
his
own
they
were
dull
and
lustreless
but
even
as
he
gazed
a
little
shifting
sparkle
came
into
them
and
the
lips
quivered
she
is
not
absolutely
unconscious
said
he
would
it
not
be
well
to
use
the
knife
while
it
will
be
painless
the
same
thought
had
crossed
the
surgeon's
mind
he
grasped
the
wounded
lip
with
his
forceps
and
with
two
swift
cuts
he
took
out
a
broad
v-shaped
piece
the
woman
sprang
up
on
the
couch
with
a
dreadful
gurgling
scream
her
covering
was
torn
from
her
face
it
was
a
face
that
he
knew
in
spite
of
that
protruding
upper
lip
and
that
slobber
of
blood
it
was
a
face
that
he
knew
she
kept
on
putting
her
hand
up
to
the
gap
and
screaming
douglas
stone
sat
down
at
the
foot
of
the
couch
with
his
knife
and
his
forceps
the
room
was
whirling
round
and
he
had
felt
something
go
like
a
ripping
seam
behind
his
ear
a
bystander
would
have
said
that
his
face
was
the
more
ghastly
of
the
two
as
in
a
dream
or
as
if
he
had
been
looking
at
something
at
the
play
he
was
conscious
that
the
turk's
hair
and
beard
lay
upon
the
table
and
that
lord
sannox
was
leaning
against
the
wall
with
his
hand
to
his
side
laughing
silently
the
screams
had
died
away
now
and
the
dreadful
head
had
dropped
back
again
upon
the
pillow
but
douglas
stone
still
sat
motionless
and
lord
sannox
still
chuckled
quietly
to
himself
it
was
really
very
necessary
for
marion
this
operation
said
he
not
physically
but
morally
you
know
morally
douglas
stone
stooped
for
yards
and
began
to
play
with
the
fringe
of
the
coverlet
his
knife
tinkled
down
upon
the
ground
but
he
still
held
the
forceps
and
something
more
i
had
long
intended
to
make
a
little
example
said
lord
sannox
suavely
your
note
of
wednesday
miscarried
and
i
have
it
here
in
my
pocket-book
i
took
some
pains
in
carrying
out
my
idea
the
wound
by
the
way
was
from
nothing
more
dangerous
than
my
signet
ring
he
glanced
keenly
at
his
silent
companion
and
cocked
the
small
revolver
which
he
held
in
his
coat
pocket
but
douglas
stone
was
still
picking
at
the
coverlet
you
see
you
have
kept
your
appointment
after
all
said
lord
sannox
and
at
that
douglas
stone
began
to
laugh
he
laughed
long
and
loudly
but
lord
sannox
did
not
laugh
now
something
like
fear
sharpened
and
hardened
his
features
he
walked
from
the
room
and
he
walked
on
tiptoe
the
old
woman
was
waiting
outside
attend
to
your
mistress
when
she
awakes
said
lord
sannox
then
he
went
down
to
the
street
the
cab
was
at
the
door
and
the
driver
raised
his
hand
to
his
hat
john
said
lord
sannox
you
will
take
the
doctor
home
first
he
will
want
leading
downstairs
i
think
tell
his
butler
that
he
has
been
taken
ill
at
a
case
very
good
sir
then
you
can
take
lady
sannox
home
and
how
about
yourself
sir
oh
my
address
for
the
next
few
months
will
be
hotel
di
roma
venice
just
see
that
the
letters
are
sent
on
and
tell
stevens
to
exhibit
all
the
purple
chrysanthemums
next
monday
and
to
wire
me
the
result
the
terror
of
blue
john
gap
the
following
narrative
was
found
among
the
papers
of
dr
james
hardcastle
who
died
of
phthisis
on
february
4th
1908
at
36
upper
coventry
flats
south
kensington
those
who
knew
him
best
while
refusing
to
express
an
opinion
upon
this
particular
statement
are
unanimous
in
asserting
that
he
was
a
man
of
a
sober
and
scientific
turn
of
mind
absolutely
devoid
of
imagination
and
most
unlikely
to
invent
any
abnormal
series
of
events
the
paper
was
contained
in
an
envelope
which
was
docketed
a
short
account
of
the
circumstances
which
occurred
near
miss
allerton's
farm
in
north-west
derbyshire
in
the
spring
of
last
year
the
envelope
was
sealed
and
on
the
other
side
was
written
in
pencil--
dear
seaton--
it
may
interest
and
perhaps
pain
you
to
know
that
the
incredulity
with
which
you
met
my
story
has
prevented
me
from
ever
opening
my
mouth
upon
the
subject
again
i
leave
this
record
after
my
death
and
perhaps
strangers
may
be
found
to
have
more
confidence
in
me
than
my
friend
inquiry
has
failed
to
elicit
who
this
seaton
may
have
been
i
may
add
that
the
visit
of
the
deceased
to
allerton's
farm
and
the
general
nature
of
the
alarm
there
apart
from
his
particular
explanation
have
been
absolutely
established
with
this
foreword
i
append
his
account
exactly
as
he
left
it
it
is
in
the
form
of
a
diary
some
entries
in
which
have
been
expanded
while
a
few
have
been
erased
april
17--already
i
feel
the
benefit
of
this
wonderful
upland
air
the
farm
of
the
allertons
lies
fourteen
hundred
and
twenty
feet
above
sea-level
so
it
may
well
be
a
bracing
climate
beyond
the
usual
morning
cough
i
have
very
little
discomfort
and
what
with
the
fresh
milk
and
the
home-grown
mutton
i
have
every
chance
of
putting
on
weight
i
think
saunderson
will
be
pleased
the
two
miss
allertons
are
charmingly
quaint
and
kind
two
dear
little
hard-working
old
maids
who
are
ready
to
lavish
all
the
heart
which
might
have
gone
out
to
husband
and
to
children
upon
an
invalid
stranger
truly
the
old
maid
is
a
most
useful
person
one
of
the
reserve
forces
of
the
community
they
talk
of
the
superfluous
woman
but
what
would
the
poor
superfluous
man
do
without
her
kindly
presence
by
the
way
in
their
simplicity
they
very
quickly
let
out
the
reason
why
saunderson
recommended
their
farm
the
professor
rose
from
the
ranks
himself
and
i
believe
that
in
his
youth
he
was
not
above
scaring
crows
in
these
very
fields
it
is
a
most
lonely
spot
and
the
walks
are
picturesque
in
the
extreme
the
farm
consists
of
grazing
land
lying
at
the
bottom
of
an
irregular
valley
on
each
side
are
the
fantastic
limestone
hills
formed
of
rock
so
soft
that
you
can
break
it
away
with
your
hands
all
this
country
is
hollow
could
you
strike
it
with
some
gigantic
hammer
it
would
boom
like
a
drum
or
possibly
cave
in
altogether
and
expose
some
huge
subterranean
sea
a
great
sea
there
must
surely
be
for
on
all
sides
the
streams
run
into
the
mountain
itself
never
to
reappear
there
are
gaps
everywhere
amid
the
rocks
and
when
you
pass
through
them
you
find
yourself
in
great
caverns
which
wind
down
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
i
have
a
small
bicycle
lamp
and
it
is
a
perpetual
joy
to
me
to
carry
it
into
these
weird
solitudes
and
to
see
the
wonderful
silver
and
black
effect
when
i
throw
its
light
upon
the
stalactites
which
drape
the
lofty
roofs
shut
off
the
lamp
and
you
are
in
the
blackest
darkness
turn
it
on
and
it
is
a
scene
from
the
arabian
nights
but
there
is
one
of
these
strange
openings
in
the
earth
which
has
a
special
interest
for
it
is
the
handiwork
not
of
nature
but
of
man
i
had
never
heard
of
blue
john
when
i
came
to
these
parts
it
is
the
name
given
to
a
peculiar
mineral
of
a
beautiful
purple
shade
which
is
only
found
at
one
or
two
places
in
the
world
it
is
so
rare
that
an
ordinary
vase
of
blue
john
would
be
valued
at
a
great
price
the
romans
with
that
extraordinary
instinct
of
theirs
discovered
that
it
was
to
be
found
in
this
valley
and
sank
a
horizontal
shaft
deep
into
the
mountain
side
the
opening
of
their
mine
has
been
called
blue
john
gap
a
clean-cut
arch
in
the
rock
the
mouth
all
overgrown
with
bushes
it
is
a
goodly
passage
which
the
roman
miners
have
cut
and
it
intersects
some
of
the
great
water-worn
caves
so
that
if
you
enter
blue
john
gap
you
would
do
well
to
mark
your
steps
and
to
have
a
good
store
of
candles
or
you
may
never
make
your
way
back
to
the
daylight
again
i
have
not
yet
gone
deeply
into
it
but
this
very
day
i
stood
at
the
mouth
of
the
arched
tunnel
and
peering
down
into
the
black
recesses
beyond
i
vowed
that
when
my
health
returned
i
would
devote
some
holiday
to
exploring
those
mysterious
depths
and
finding
out
for
myself
how
far
the
roman
had
penetrated
into
the
derbyshire
hills
strange
how
superstitious
these
countrymen
are
i
should
have
thought
better
of
young
armitage
for
he
is
a
man
of
some
education
and
character
and
a
very
fine
fellow
for
his
station
in
life
i
was
standing
at
the
blue
john
gap
when
he
came
across
the
field
to
me
well
doctor
said
he
you're
not
afraid
anyhow
afraid
i
answered
afraid
of
what
of
it
said
he
with
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
towards
the
black
vault
of
the
terror
that
lives
in
the
blue
john
cave
how
absurdly
easy
it
is
for
a
legend
to
arise
in
a
lonely
countryside
i
examined
him
as
to
the
reasons
for
his
weird
belief
it
seems
that
from
time
to
time
sheep
have
been
missing
from
the
fields
carried
bodily
away
according
to
armitage
that
they
could
have
wandered
away
of
their
own
accord
and
disappeared
among
the
mountains
was
an
explanation
to
which
he
would
not
listen
on
one
occasion
a
pool
of
blood
had
been
found
and
some
tufts
of
wool
that
also
i
pointed
out
could
be
explained
in
a
perfectly
natural
way
further
the
nights
upon
which
sheep
disappeared
were
invariably
very
dark
cloudy
nights
with
no
moon
this
i
met
with
the
obvious
retort
that
those
were
the
nights
which
a
commonplace
sheep-stealer
would
naturally
choose
for
his
work
on
one
occasion
a
gap
had
been
made
in
a
wall
and
some
of
the
stones
scattered
for
a
considerable
distance
human
agency
again
in
my
opinion
finally
armitage
clinched
all
his
arguments
by
telling
me
that
he
had
actually
heard
the
creature--indeed
that
anyone
could
hear
it
who
remained
long
enough
at
the
gap
it
was
a
distant
roaring
of
an
immense
volume
i
could
not
but
smile
at
this
knowing
as
i
do
the
strange
reverberations
which
come
out
of
an
underground
water
system
running
amid
the
chasms
of
a
limestone
formation
my
incredulity
annoyed
armitage
so
that
he
turned
and
left
me
with
some
abruptness
and
now
comes
the
queer
point
about
the
whole
business
i
was
still
standing
near
the
mouth
of
the
cave
turning
over
in
my
mind
the
various
statements
of
armitage
and
reflecting
how
readily
they
could
be
explained
away
when
suddenly
from
the
depth
of
the
tunnel
beside
me
there
issued
a
most
extraordinary
sound
how
shall
i
describe
it
first
of
all
it
seemed
to
be
a
great
distance
away
far
down
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
secondly
in
spite
of
this
suggestion
of
distance
it
was
very
loud
lastly
it
was
not
a
boom
nor
a
crash
such
as
one
would
associate
with
falling
water
or
tumbling
rock
but
it
was
a
high
whine
tremulous
and
vibrating
almost
like
the
whinnying
of
a
horse
it
was
certainly
a
most
remarkable
experience
and
one
which
for
a
moment
i
must
admit
gave
a
new
significance
to
armitage's
words
i
waited
by
the
blue
john
gap
for
half
an
hour
or
more
but
there
was
no
return
of
the
sound
so
at
last
i
wandered
back
to
the
farmhouse
rather
mystified
by
what
had
occurred
decidedly
i
shall
explore
that
cavern
when
my
strength
is
restored
of
course
armitage's
explanation
is
too
absurd
for
discussion
and
yet
that
sound
was
certainly
very
strange
it
still
rings
in
my
ears
as
i
write
april
20--in
the
last
three
days
i
have
made
several
expeditions
to
the
blue
john
gap
and
have
even
penetrated
some
short
distance
but
my
bicycle
lantern
is
so
small
and
weak
that
i
dare
not
trust
myself
very
far
i
shall
do
the
thing
more
systematically
i
have
heard
no
sound
at
all
and
could
almost
believe
that
i
had
been
the
victim
of
some
hallucination
suggested
perhaps
by
armitage's
conversation
of
course
the
whole
idea
is
absurd
and
yet
i
must
confess
that
those
bushes
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
do
present
an
appearance
as
if
some
heavy
creature
had
forced
its
way
through
them
i
begin
to
be
keenly
interested
i
have
said
nothing
to
the
miss
allertons
for
they
are
quite
superstitious
enough
already
but
i
have
bought
some
candles
and
mean
to
investigate
for
myself
i
observed
this
morning
that
among
the
numerous
tufts
of
sheep's
wool
which
lay
among
the
bushes
near
the
cavern
there
was
one
which
was
smeared
with
blood
of
course
my
reason
tells
me
that
if
sheep
wander
into
such
rocky
places
they
are
likely
to
injure
themselves
and
yet
somehow
that
splash
of
crimson
gave
me
a
sudden
shock
and
for
a
moment
i
found
myself
shrinking
back
in
horror
from
the
old
roman
arch
a
fetid
breath
seemed
to
ooze
from
the
black
depths
into
which
i
peered
could
it
indeed
be
possible
that
some
nameless
thing
some
dreadful
presence
was
lurking
down
yonder
i
should
have
been
incapable
of
such
feelings
in
the
days
of
my
strength
but
one
grows
more
nervous
and
fanciful
when
one's
health
is
shaken
for
the
moment
i
weakened
in
my
resolution
and
was
ready
to
leave
the
secret
of
the
old
mine
if
one
exists
for
ever
unsolved
but
tonight
my
interest
has
returned
and
my
nerves
grown
more
steady
tomorrow
i
trust
that
i
shall
have
gone
more
deeply
into
this
matter
april
22--let
me
try
and
set
down
as
accurately
as
i
can
my
extraordinary
experience
of
yesterday
i
started
in
the
afternoon
and
made
my
way
to
the
blue
john
gap
i
confess
that
my
misgivings
returned
as
i
gazed
into
its
depths
and
i
wished
that
i
had
brought
a
companion
to
share
my
exploration
finally
with
a
return
of
resolution
i
lit
my
candle
pushed
my
way
through
the
briars
and
descended
into
the
rocky
shaft
it
went
down
at
an
acute
angle
for
some
fifty
feet
the
floor
being
covered
with
broken
stone
thence
there
extended
a
long
straight
passage
cut
in
the
solid
rock
i
am
no
geologist
but
the
lining
of
this
corridor
was
certainly
of
some
harder
material
than
limestone
for
there
were
points
where
i
could
actually
see
the
tool-marks
which
the
old
miners
had
left
in
their
excavation
as
fresh
as
if
they
had
been
done
yesterday
down
this
strange
old-world
corridor
i
stumbled
my
feeble
flame
throwing
a
dim
circle
of
light
around
me
which
made
the
shadows
beyond
the
more
threatening
and
obscure
finally
i
came
to
a
spot
where
the
roman
tunnel
opened
into
a
water-worn
cavern--a
huge
hall
hung
with
long
white
icicles
of
lime
deposit
from
this
central
chamber
i
could
dimly
perceive
that
a
number
of
passages
worn
by
the
subterranean
streams
wound
away
into
the
depths
of
the
earth
i
was
standing
there
wondering
whether
i
had
better
return
or
whether
i
dare
venture
farther
into
this
dangerous
labyrinth
when
my
eyes
fell
upon
something
at
my
feet
which
strongly
arrested
my
attention
the
greater
part
of
the
floor
of
the
cavern
was
covered
with
boulders
of
rock
or
with
hard
incrustations
of
lime
but
at
this
particular
point
there
had
been
a
drip
from
the
distant
roof
which
had
left
a
patch
of
soft
mud
in
the
very
centre
of
this
there
was
a
huge
mark--an
ill-defined
blotch
deep
broad
and
irregular
as
if
a
great
boulder
had
fallen
upon
it
no
loose
stone
lay
near
however
nor
was
there
anything
to
account
for
the
impression
it
was
far
too
large
to
be
caused
by
any
possible
animal
and
besides
there
was
only
the
one
and
the
patch
of
mud
was
of
such
a
size
that
no
reasonable
stride
could
have
covered
it
as
i
rose
from
the
examination
of
that
singular
mark
and
then
looked
round
into
the
black
shadows
which
hemmed
me
in
i
must
confess
that
i
felt
for
a
moment
a
most
unpleasant
sinking
of
my
heart
and
that
do
what
i
could
the
candle
trembled
in
my
outstretched
hand
i
soon
recovered
my
nerve
however
when
i
reflected
how
absurd
it
was
to
associate
so
huge
and
shapeless
a
mark
with
the
track
of
any
known
animal
even
an
elephant
could
not
have
produced
it
i
determined
therefore
that
i
would
not
be
scared
by
vague
and
senseless
fears
from
carrying
out
my
exploration
before
proceeding
i
took
good
note
of
a
curious
rock
formation
in
the
wall
by
which
i
could
recognize
the
entrance
of
the
roman
tunnel
the
precaution
was
very
necessary
for
the
great
cave
so
far
as
i
could
see
it
was
intersected
by
passages
having
made
sure
of
my
position
and
reassured
myself
by
examining
my
spare
candles
and
my
matches
i
advanced
slowly
over
the
rocky
and
uneven
surface
of
the
cavern
and
now
i
come
to
the
point
where
i
met
with
such
sudden
and
desperate
disaster
a
stream
some
twenty
feet
broad
ran
across
my
path
and
i
walked
for
some
little
distance
along
the
bank
to
find
a
spot
where
i
could
cross
dry-shod
finally
i
came
to
a
place
where
a
single
flat
boulder
lay
near
the
centre
which
i
could
reach
in
a
stride
as
it
chanced
however
the
rock
had
been
cut
away
and
made
top-heavy
by
the
rush
of
the
stream
so
that
it
tilted
over
as
i
landed
on
it
and
shot
me
into
the
ice-cold
water
my
candle
went
out
and
i
found
myself
floundering
about
in
utter
and
absolute
darkness
i
staggered
to
my
feet
again
more
amused
than
alarmed
by
my
adventure
the
candle
had
fallen
from
my
hand
and
was
lost
in
the
stream
but
i
had
two
others
in
my
pocket
so
that
it
was
of
no
importance
i
got
one
of
them
ready
and
drew
out
my
box
of
matches
to
light
it
only
then
did
i
realize
my
position
the
box
had
been
soaked
in
my
fall
into
the
river
it
was
impossible
to
strike
the
matches
a
cold
hand
seemed
to
close
round
my
heart
as
i
realized
my
position
the
darkness
was
opaque
and
horrible
it
was
so
utter
one
put
one's
hand
up
to
one's
face
as
if
to
press
off
something
solid
i
stood
still
and
by
an
effort
i
steadied
myself
i
tried
to
reconstruct
in
my
mind
a
map
of
the
floor
of
the
cavern
as
i
had
last
seen
it
alas
the
bearings
which
had
impressed
themselves
upon
my
mind
were
high
on
the
wall
and
not
to
be
found
by
touch
still
i
remembered
in
a
general
way
how
the
sides
were
situated
and
i
hoped
that
by
groping
my
way
along
them
i
should
at
last
come
to
the
opening
of
the
roman
tunnel
moving
very
slowly
and
continually
striking
against
the
rocks
i
set
out
on
this
desperate
quest
but
i
very
soon
realized
how
impossible
it
was
in
that
black
velvety
darkness
one
lost
all
one's
bearings
in
an
instant
before
i
had
made
a
dozen
paces
i
was
utterly
bewildered
as
to
my
whereabouts
the
rippling
of
the
stream
which
was
the
one
sound
audible
showed
me
where
it
lay
but
the
moment
that
i
left
its
bank
i
was
utterly
lost
the
idea
of
finding
my
way
back
in
absolute
darkness
through
that
limestone
labyrinth
was
clearly
an
impossible
one
i
sat
down
upon
a
boulder
and
reflected
upon
my
unfortunate
plight
i
had
not
told
anyone
that
i
proposed
to
come
to
the
blue
john
mine
and
it
was
unlikely
that
a
search
party
would
come
after
me
therefore
i
must
trust
to
my
own
resources
to
get
clear
of
the
danger
there
was
only
one
hope
and
that
was
that
the
matches
might
dry
when
i
fell
into
the
river
only
half
of
me
had
got
thoroughly
wet
my
left
shoulder
had
remained
above
the
water
i
took
the
box
of
matches
therefore
and
put
it
into
my
left
armpit
the
moist
air
of
the
cavern
might
possibly
be
counteracted
by
the
heat
of
my
body
but
even
so
i
knew
that
i
could
not
hope
to
get
a
light
for
many
hours
meanwhile
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait
by
good
luck
i
had
slipped
several
biscuits
into
my
pocket
before
i
left
the
farm-house
these
i
now
devoured
and
washed
them
down
with
a
draught
from
that
wretched
stream
which
had
been
the
cause
of
all
my
misfortunes
then
i
felt
about
for
a
comfortable
seat
among
the
rocks
and
having
discovered
a
place
where
i
could
get
a
support
for
my
back
i
stretched
out
my
legs
and
settled
myself
down
to
wait
i
was
wretchedly
damp
and
cold
but
i
tried
to
cheer
myself
with
the
reflection
that
modern
science
prescribed
open
windows
and
walks
in
all
weather
for
my
disease
gradually
lulled
by
the
monotonous
gurgle
of
the
stream
and
by
the
absolute
darkness
i
sank
into
an
uneasy
slumber
how
long
this
lasted
i
cannot
say
it
may
have
been
for
an
hour
it
may
have
been
for
several
suddenly
i
sat
up
on
my
rock
couch
with
every
nerve
thrilling
and
every
sense
acutely
on
the
alert
beyond
all
doubt
i
had
heard
a
sound--some
sound
very
distinct
from
the
gurgling
of
the
waters
it
had
passed
but
the
reverberation
of
it
still
lingered
in
my
ear
was
it
a
search
party
they
would
most
certainly
have
shouted
and
vague
as
this
sound
was
which
had
wakened
me
it
was
very
distinct
from
the
human
voice
i
sat
palpitating
and
hardly
daring
to
breathe
there
it
was
again
and
again
now
it
had
become
continuous
it
was
a
tread--yes
surely
it
was
the
tread
of
some
living
creature
but
what
a
tread
it
was
it
gave
one
the
impression
of
enormous
weight
carried
upon
sponge-like
feet
which
gave
forth
a
muffled
but
ear-filling
sound
the
darkness
was
as
complete
as
ever
but
the
tread
was
regular
and
decisive
and
it
was
coming
beyond
all
question
in
my
direction
my
skin
grew
cold
and
my
hair
stood
on
end
as
i
listened
to
that
steady
and
ponderous
footfall
there
was
some
creature
there
and
surely
by
the
speed
of
its
advance
it
was
one
which
could
see
in
the
dark
i
crouched
low
on
my
rock
and
tried
to
blend
myself
into
it
the
steps
grew
nearer
still
then
stopped
and
presently
i
was
aware
of
a
loud
lapping
and
gurgling
the
creature
was
drinking
at
the
stream
then
again
there
was
silence
broken
by
a
succession
of
long
sniffs
and
snorts
of
tremendous
volume
and
energy
had
it
caught
the
scent
of
me
my
own
nostrils
were
filled
by
a
low
fetid
odour
mephitic
and
abominable
then
i
heard
the
steps
again
they
were
on
my
side
of
the
stream
now
the
stones
rattled
within
a
few
yards
of
where
i
lay
hardly
daring
to
breathe
i
crouched
upon
my
rock
then
the
steps
drew
away
i
heard
the
splash
as
it
returned
across
the
river
and
the
sound
died
away
into
the
distance
in
the
direction
from
which
it
had
come
for
a
long
time
i
lay
upon
the
rock
too
much
horrified
to
move
i
thought
of
the
sound
which
i
had
heard
coming
from
the
depths
of
the
cave
of
armitage's
fears
of
the
strange
impression
in
the
mud
and
now
came
this
final
and
absolute
proof
that
there
was
indeed
some
inconceivable
monster
something
utterly
unearthly
and
dreadful
which
lurked
in
the
hollow
of
the
mountain
of
its
nature
or
form
i
could
frame
no
conception
save
that
it
was
both
light-footed
and
gigantic
the
combat
between
my
reason
which
told
me
that
such
things
could
not
be
and
my
senses
which
told
me
that
they
were
raged
within
me
as
i
lay
finally
i
was
almost
ready
to
persuade
myself
that
this
experience
had
been
part
of
some
evil
dream
and
that
my
abnormal
condition
might
have
conjured
up
an
hallucination
but
there
remained
one
final
experience
which
removed
the
last
possibility
of
doubt
from
my
mind
i
had
taken
my
matches
from
my
armpit
and
felt
them
they
seemed
perfectly
hard
and
dry
stooping
down
into
a
crevice
of
the
rocks
i
tried
one
of
them
to
my
delight
it
took
fire
at
once
i
lit
the
candle
and
with
a
terrified
backward
glance
into
the
obscure
depths
of
the
cavern
i
hurried
in
the
direction
of
the
roman
passage
as
i
did
so
i
passed
the
patch
of
mud
on
which
i
had
seen
the
huge
imprint
now
i
stood
astonished
before
it
for
there
were
three
similar
imprints
upon
its
surface
enormous
in
size
irregular
in
outline
of
a
depth
which
indicated
the
ponderous
weight
which
had
left
them
then
a
great
terror
surged
over
me
stooping
and
shading
my
candle
with
my
hand
i
ran
in
a
frenzy
of
fear
to
the
rocky
archway
hastened
up
it
and
never
stopped
until
with
weary
feet
and
panting
lungs
i
rushed
up
the
final
slope
of
stones
broke
through
the
tangle
of
briars
and
flung
myself
exhausted
upon
the
soft
grass
under
the
peaceful
light
of
the
stars
it
was
three
in
the
morning
when
i
reached
the
farm-house
and
today
i
am
all
unstrung
and
quivering
after
my
terrific
adventure
as
yet
i
have
told
no
one
i
must
move
warily
in
the
matter
what
would
the
poor
lonely
women
or
the
uneducated
yokels
here
think
of
it
if
i
were
to
tell
them
my
experience
let
me
go
to
someone
who
can
understand
and
advise
april
25--i
was
laid
up
in
bed
for
two
days
after
my
incredible
adventure
in
the
cavern
i
use
the
adjective
with
a
very
definite
meaning
for
i
have
had
an
experience
since
which
has
shocked
me
almost
as
much
as
the
other
i
have
said
that
i
was
looking
round
for
someone
who
could
advise
me
there
is
a
dr
mark
johnson
who
practices
some
few
miles
away
to
whom
i
had
a
note
of
recommendation
from
professor
saunderson
to
him
i
drove
when
i
was
strong
enough
to
get
about
and
i
recounted
to
him
my
whole
strange
experience
he
listened
intently
and
then
carefully
examined
me
paying
special
attention
to
my
reflexes
and
to
the
pupils
of
my
eyes
when
he
had
finished
he
refused
to
discuss
my
adventure
saying
that
it
was
entirely
beyond
him
but
he
gave
me
the
card
of
a
mr
picton
at
castleton
with
the
advice
that
i
should
instantly
go
to
him
and
tell
him
the
story
exactly
as
i
had
done
to
himself
he
was
according
to
my
adviser
the
very
man
who
was
pre-eminently
suited
to
help
me
i
went
on
to
the
station
therefore
and
made
my
way
to
the
little
town
which
is
some
ten
miles
away
mr
picton
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
importance
as
his
brass
plate
was
displayed
upon
the
door
of
a
considerable
building
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
i
was
about
to
ring
his
bell
when
some
misgiving
came
into
my
mind
and
crossing
to
a
neighbouring
shop
i
asked
the
man
behind
the
counter
if
he
could
tell
me
anything
of
mr
picton
why
said
he
he
is
the
best
mad
doctor
in
derbyshire
and
yonder
is
his
asylum
you
can
imagine
that
it
was
not
long
before
i
had
shaken
the
dust
of
castleton
from
my
feet
and
returned
to
the
farm
cursing
all
unimaginative
pedants
who
cannot
conceive
that
there
may
be
things
in
creation
which
have
never
yet
chanced
to
come
across
their
mole's
vision
after
all
now
that
i
am
cooler
i
can
afford
to
admit
that
i
have
been
no
more
sympathetic
to
armitage
than
dr
johnson
has
been
to
me
april
27
when
i
was
a
student
i
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
man
of
courage
and
enterprise
i
remember
that
when
there
was
a
ghost-hunt
at
coltbridge
it
was
i
who
sat
up
in
the
haunted
house
is
it
advancing
years
after
all
i
am
only
thirty-five
or
is
it
this
physical
malady
which
has
caused
degeneration
certainly
my
heart
quails
when
i
think
of
that
horrible
cavern
in
the
hill
and
the
certainty
that
it
has
some
monstrous
occupant
what
shall
i
do
there
is
not
an
hour
in
the
day
that
i
do
not
debate
the
question
if
i
say
nothing
then
the
mystery
remains
unsolved
if
i
do
say
anything
then
i
have
the
alternative
of
mad
alarm
over
the
whole
countryside
or
of
absolute
incredulity
which
may
end
in
consigning
me
to
an
asylum
on
the
whole
i
think
that
my
best
course
is
to
wait
and
to
prepare
for
some
expedition
which
shall
be
more
deliberate
and
better
thought
out
than
the
last
as
a
first
step
i
have
been
to
castleton
and
obtained
a
few
essentials--a
large
acetylene
lantern
for
one
thing
and
a
good
double-barrelled
sporting
rifle
for
another
the
latter
i
have
hired
but
i
have
bought
a
dozen
heavy
game
cartridges
which
would
bring
down
a
rhinoceros
now
i
am
ready
for
my
troglodyte
friend
give
me
better
health
and
a
little
spate
of
energy
and
i
shall
try
conclusions
with
him
yet
but
who
and
what
is
he
ah
there
is
the
question
which
stands
between
me
and
my
sleep
how
many
theories
do
i
form
only
to
discard
each
in
turn
it
is
all
so
utterly
unthinkable
and
yet
the
cry
the
footmark
the
tread
in
the
cavern--no
reasoning
can
get
past
these
i
think
of
the
old-world
legends
of
dragons
and
of
other
monsters
were
they
perhaps
not
such
fairy-tales
as
we
have
thought
can
it
be
that
there
is
some
fact
which
underlies
them
and
am
i
of
all
mortals
the
one
who
is
chosen
to
expose
it
may
3--for
several
days
i
have
been
laid
up
by
the
vagaries
of
an
english
spring
and
during
those
days
there
have
been
developments
the
true
and
sinister
meaning
of
which
no
one
can
appreciate
save
myself
i
may
say
that
we
have
had
cloudy
and
moonless
nights
of
late
which
according
to
my
information
were
the
seasons
upon
which
sheep
disappeared
well
sheep
have
disappeared
two
of
miss
allerton's
one
of
old
pearson's
of
the
cat
walk
and
one
of
mrs
moulton's
four
in
all
during
three
nights
no
trace
is
left
of
them
at
all
and
the
countryside
is
buzzing
with
rumours
of
gipsies
and
of
sheep-stealers
but
there
is
something
more
serious
than
that
young
armitage
has
disappeared
also
he
left
his
moorland
cottage
early
on
wednesday
night
and
has
never
been
heard
of
since
he
was
an
unattached
man
so
there
is
less
sensation
than
would
otherwise
be
the
case
the
popular
explanation
is
that
he
owes
money
and
has
found
a
situation
in
some
other
part
of
the
country
whence
he
will
presently
write
for
his
belongings
but
i
have
grave
misgivings
is
it
not
much
more
likely
that
the
recent
tragedy
of
the
sheep
has
caused
him
to
take
some
steps
which
may
have
ended
in
his
own
destruction
he
may
for
example
have
lain
in
wait
for
the
creature
and
been
carried
off
by
it
into
the
recesses
of
the
mountains
what
an
inconceivable
fate
for
a
civilized
englishman
of
the
twentieth
century
and
yet
i
feel
that
it
is
possible
and
even
probable
but
in
that
case
how
far
am
i
answerable
both
for
his
death
and
for
any
other
mishap
which
may
occur
surely
with
the
knowledge
i
already
possess
it
must
be
my
duty
to
see
that
something
is
done
or
if
necessary
to
do
it
myself
it
must
be
the
latter
for
this
morning
i
went
down
to
the
local
police-station
and
told
my
story
the
inspector
entered
it
all
in
a
large
book
and
bowed
me
out
with
commendable
gravity
but
i
heard
a
burst
of
laughter
before
i
had
got
down
his
garden
path
no
doubt
he
was
recounting
my
adventure
to
his
family
june
10--i
am
writing
this
propped
up
in
bed
six
weeks
after
my
last
entry
in
this
journal
i
have
gone
through
a
terrible
shock
both
to
mind
and
body
arising
from
such
an
experience
as
has
seldom
befallen
a
human
being
before
but
i
have
attained
my
end
the
danger
from
the
terror
which
dwells
in
the
blue
john
gap
has
passed
never
to
return
thus
much
at
least
i
a
broken
invalid
have
done
for
the
common
good
let
me
now
recount
what
occurred
as
clearly
as
i
may
the
night
of
friday
may
3rd
was
dark
and
cloudy--the
very
night
for
the
monster
to
walk
about
eleven
o'clock
i
went
from
the
farm-house
with
my
lantern
and
my
rifle
having
first
left
a
note
upon
the
table
of
my
bedroom
in
which
i
said
that
if
i
were
missing
search
should
be
made
for
me
in
the
direction
of
the
gap
i
made
my
way
to
the
mouth
of
the
roman
shaft
and
having
perched
myself
among
the
rocks
close
to
the
opening
i
shut
off
my
lantern
and
waited
patiently
with
my
loaded
rifle
ready
to
my
hand
it
was
a
melancholy
vigil
all
down
the
winding
valley
i
could
see
the
scattered
lights
of
the
farm-houses
and
the
church
clock
of
chapel-le-dale
tolling
the
hours
came
faintly
to
my
ears
these
tokens
of
my
fellow-men
served
only
to
make
my
own
position
seem
the
more
lonely
and
to
call
for
a
greater
effort
to
overcome
the
terror
which
tempted
me
continually
to
get
back
to
the
farm
and
abandon
for
ever
this
dangerous
quest
and
yet
there
lies
deep
in
every
man
a
rooted
self-respect
which
makes
it
hard
for
him
to
turn
back
from
that
which
he
has
once
undertaken
this
feeling
of
personal
pride
was
my
salvation
now
and
it
was
that
alone
which
held
me
fast
when
every
instinct
of
my
nature
was
dragging
me
away
i
am
glad
now
that
i
had
the
strength
in
spite
of
all
that
is
has
cost
me
my
manhood
is
at
least
above
reproach
twelve
o'clock
struck
in
the
distant
church
then
one
then
two
it
was
the
darkest
hour
of
the
night
the
clouds
were
drifting
low
and
there
was
not
a
star
in
the
sky
an
owl
was
hooting
somewhere
among
the
rocks
but
no
other
sound
save
the
gentle
sough
of
the
wind
came
to
my
ears
and
then
suddenly
i
heard
it
from
far
away
down
the
tunnel
came
those
muffled
steps
so
soft
and
yet
so
ponderous
i
heard
also
the
rattle
of
stones
as
they
gave
way
under
that
giant
tread
they
drew
nearer
they
were
close
upon
me
i
heard
the
crashing
of
the
bushes
round
the
entrance
and
then
dimly
through
the
darkness
i
was
conscious
of
the
loom
of
some
enormous
shape
some
monstrous
inchoate
creature
passing
swiftly
and
very
silently
out
from
the
tunnel
i
was
paralysed
with
fear
and
amazement
long
as
i
had
waited
now
that
it
had
actually
come
i
was
unprepared
for
the
shock
i
lay
motionless
and
breathless
whilst
the
great
dark
mass
whisked
by
me
and
was
swallowed
up
in
the
night
but
now
i
nerved
myself
for
its
return
no
sound
came
from
the
sleeping
countryside
to
tell
of
the
horror
which
was
loose
in
no
way
could
i
judge
how
far
off
it
was
what
it
was
doing
or
when
it
might
be
back
but
not
a
second
time
should
my
nerve
fail
me
not
a
second
time
should
it
pass
unchallenged
i
swore
it
between
my
clenched
teeth
as
i
laid
my
cocked
rifle
across
the
rock
and
yet
it
nearly
happened
there
was
no
warning
of
approach
now
as
the
creature
passed
over
the
grass
suddenly
like
a
dark
drifting
shadow
the
huge
bulk
loomed
up
once
more
before
me
making
for
the
entrance
of
the
cave
again
came
that
paralysis
of
volition
which
held
my
crooked
forefinger
impotent
upon
the
trigger
but
with
a
desperate
effort
i
shook
it
off
even
as
the
brushwood
rustled
and
the
monstrous
beast
blended
with
the
shadow
of
the
gap
i
fired
at
the
retreating
form
in
the
blaze
of
the
gun
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
great
shaggy
mass
something
with
rough
and
bristling
hair
of
a
withered
grey
colour
fading
away
to
white
in
its
lower
parts
the
huge
body
supported
upon
short
thick
curving
legs
i
had
just
that
glance
and
then
i
heard
the
rattle
of
the
stones
as
the
creature
tore
down
into
its
burrow
in
an
instant
with
a
triumphant
revulsion
of
feeling
i
had
cast
my
fears
to
the
wind
and
uncovering
my
powerful
lantern
with
my
rifle
in
my
hand
i
sprang
down
from
my
rock
and
rushed
after
the
monster
down
the
old
roman
shaft
my
splendid
lamp
cast
a
brilliant
flood
of
vivid
light
in
front
of
me
very
different
from
the
yellow
glimmer
which
had
aided
me
down
the
same
passage
only
twelve
days
before
as
i
ran
i
saw
the
great
beast
lurching
along
before
me
its
huge
bulk
filling
up
the
whole
space
from
wall
to
wall
its
hair
looked
like
coarse
faded
oakum
and
hung
down
in
long
dense
masses
which
swayed
as
it
moved
it
was
like
an
enormous
unclipped
sheep
in
its
fleece
but
in
size
it
was
far
larger
than
the
largest
elephant
and
its
breadth
seemed
to
be
nearly
as
great
as
its
height
it
fills
me
with
amazement
now
to
think
that
i
should
have
dared
to
follow
such
a
horror
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
but
when
one's
blood
is
up
and
when
one's
quarry
seems
to
be
flying
the
old
primeval
hunting-spirit
awakes
and
prudence
is
cast
to
the
wind
rifle
in
hand
i
ran
at
the
top
of
my
speed
upon
the
trail
of
the
monster
i
had
seen
that
the
creature
was
swift
now
i
was
to
find
out
to
my
cost
that
it
was
also
very
cunning
i
had
imagined
that
it
was
in
panic
flight
and
that
i
had
only
to
pursue
it
the
idea
that
it
might
turn
upon
me
never
entered
my
excited
brain
i
have
already
explained
that
the
passage
down
which
i
was
racing
opened
into
a
great
central
cave
into
this
i
rushed
fearful
lest
i
should
lose
all
trace
of
the
beast
but
he
had
turned
upon
his
own
traces
and
in
a
moment
we
were
face
to
face
that
picture
seen
in
the
brilliant
white
light
of
the
lantern
is
etched
for
ever
upon
my
brain
he
had
reared
up
on
his
hind
legs
as
a
bear
would
do
and
stood
above
me
enormous
menacing--such
a
creature
as
no
nightmare
had
ever
brought
to
my
imagination
i
have
said
that
he
reared
like
a
bear
and
there
was
something
bear-like--if
one
could
conceive
a
bear
which
was
ten-fold
the
bulk
of
any
bear
seen
upon
earth--in
his
whole
pose
and
attitude
in
his
great
crooked
forelegs
with
their
ivory-white
claws
in
his
rugged
skin
and
in
his
red
gaping
mouth
fringed
with
monstrous
fangs
only
in
one
point
did
he
differ
from
the
bear
or
from
any
other
creature
which
walks
the
earth
and
even
at
that
supreme
moment
a
shudder
of
horror
passed
over
me
as
i
observed
that
the
eyes
which
glistened
in
the
glow
of
my
lantern
were
huge
projecting
bulbs
white
and
sightless
for
a
moment
his
great
paws
swung
over
my
head
the
next
he
fell
forward
upon
me
i
and
my
broken
lantern
crashed
to
the
earth
and
i
remember
no
more
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
back
in
the
farm-house
of
the
allertons
two
days
had
passed
since
my
terrible
adventure
in
the
blue
john
gap
it
seems
that
i
had
lain
all
night
in
the
cave
insensible
from
concussion
of
the
brain
with
my
left
arm
and
two
ribs
badly
fractured
in
the
morning
my
note
had
been
found
a
search
party
of
a
dozen
farmers
assembled
and
i
had
been
tracked
down
and
carried
back
to
my
bedroom
where
i
had
lain
in
high
delirium
ever
since
there
was
it
seems
no
sign
of
the
creature
and
no
bloodstain
which
would
show
that
my
bullet
had
found
him
as
he
passed
save
for
my
own
plight
and
the
marks
upon
the
mud
there
was
nothing
to
prove
that
what
i
said
was
true
six
weeks
have
now
elapsed
and
i
am
able
to
sit
out
once
more
in
the
sunshine
just
opposite
me
is
the
steep
hillside
grey
with
shaly
rock
and
yonder
on
its
flank
is
the
dark
cleft
which
marks
the
opening
of
the
blue
john
gap
but
it
is
no
longer
a
source
of
terror
never
again
through
that
ill-omened
tunnel
shall
any
strange
shape
flit
out
into
the
world
of
men
the
educated
and
the
scientific
the
dr
johnsons
and
the
like
may
smile
at
my
narrative
but
the
poorer
folk
of
the
countryside
had
never
a
doubt
as
to
its
truth
on
the
day
after
my
recovering
consciousness
they
assembled
in
their
hundreds
round
the
blue
john
gap
as
the
castleton
courier
said
it
was
useless
for
our
correspondent
or
for
any
of
the
adventurous
gentlemen
who
had
come
from
matlock
buxton
and
other
parts
to
offer
to
descend
to
explore
the
cave
to
the
end
and
to
finally
test
the
extraordinary
narrative
of
dr
james
hardcastle
the
country
people
had
taken
the
matter
into
their
own
hands
and
from
an
early
hour
of
the
morning
they
had
worked
hard
in
stopping
up
the
entrance
of
the
tunnel
there
is
a
sharp
slope
where
the
shaft
begins
and
great
boulders
rolled
along
by
many
willing
hands
were
thrust
down
it
until
the
gap
was
absolutely
sealed
so
ends
the
episode
which
has
caused
such
excitement
throughout
the
country
local
opinion
is
fiercely
divided
upon
the
subject
on
the
one
hand
are
those
who
point
to
dr
hardcastle's
impaired
health
and
to
the
possibility
of
cerebral
lesions
of
tubercular
origin
giving
rise
to
strange
hallucinations
some
idee
fixe
according
to
these
gentlemen
caused
the
doctor
to
wander
down
the
tunnel
and
a
fall
among
the
rocks
was
sufficient
to
account
for
his
injuries
on
the
other
hand
a
legend
of
a
strange
creature
in
the
gap
has
existed
for
some
months
back
and
the
farmers
look
upon
dr
hardcastle's
narrative
and
his
personal
injuries
as
a
final
corroboration
so
the
matter
stands
and
so
the
matter
will
continue
to
stand
for
no
definite
solution
seems
to
us
to
be
now
possible
it
transcends
human
wit
to
give
any
scientific
explanation
which
could
cover
the
alleged
facts
perhaps
before
the
courier
published
these
words
they
would
have
been
wise
to
send
their
representative
to
me
i
have
thought
the
matter
out
as
no
one
else
has
occasion
to
do
and
it
is
possible
that
i
might
have
removed
some
of
the
more
obvious
difficulties
of
the
narrative
and
brought
it
one
degree
nearer
to
scientific
acceptance
let
me
then
write
down
the
only
explanation
which
seems
to
me
to
elucidate
what
i
know
to
my
cost
to
have
been
a
series
of
facts
my
theory
may
seem
to
be
wildly
improbable
but
at
least
no
one
can
venture
to
say
that
it
is
impossible
my
view
is--and
it
was
formed
as
is
shown
by
my
diary
before
my
personal
adventure--that
in
this
part
of
england
there
is
a
vast
subterranean
lake
or
sea
which
is
fed
by
the
great
number
of
streams
which
pass
down
through
the
limestone
where
there
is
a
large
collection
of
water
there
must
also
be
some
evaporation
mists
or
rain
and
a
possibility
of
vegetation
this
in
turn
suggests
that
there
may
be
animal
life
arising
as
the
vegetable
life
would
also
do
from
those
seeds
and
types
which
had
been
introduced
at
an
early
period
of
the
world's
history
when
communication
with
the
outer
air
was
more
easy
this
place
had
then
developed
a
fauna
and
flora
of
its
own
including
such
monsters
as
the
one
which
i
had
seen
which
may
well
have
been
the
old
cave-bear
enormously
enlarged
and
modified
by
its
new
environment
for
countless
aeons
the
internal
and
the
external
creation
had
kept
apart
growing
steadily
away
from
each
other
then
there
had
come
some
rift
in
the
depths
of
the
mountain
which
had
enabled
one
creature
to
wander
up
and
by
means
of
the
roman
tunnel
to
reach
the
open
air
like
all
subterranean
life
it
had
lost
the
power
of
sight
but
this
had
no
doubt
been
compensated
for
by
nature
in
other
directions
certainly
it
had
some
means
of
finding
its
way
about
and
of
hunting
down
the
sheep
upon
the
hillside
as
to
its
choice
of
dark
nights
it
is
part
of
my
theory
that
light
was
painful
to
those
great
white
eyeballs
and
that
it
was
only
a
pitch-black
world
which
it
could
tolerate
perhaps
indeed
it
was
the
glare
of
my
lantern
which
saved
my
life
at
that
awful
moment
when
we
were
face
to
face
so
i
read
the
riddle
i
leave
these
facts
behind
me
and
if
you
can
explain
them
do
so
or
if
you
choose
to
doubt
them
do
so
neither
your
belief
nor
your
incredulity
can
alter
them
nor
affect
one
whose
task
is
nearly
over
so
ended
the
strange
narrative
of
dr
james
hardcastle
the
brazilian
cat
it
is
hard
luck
on
a
young
fellow
to
have
expensive
tastes
great
expectations
aristocratic
connections
but
no
actual
money
in
his
pocket
and
no
profession
by
which
he
may
earn
any
the
fact
was
that
my
father
a
good
sanguine
easy-going
man
had
such
confidence
in
the
wealth
and
benevolence
of
his
bachelor
elder
brother
lord
southerton
that
he
took
it
for
granted
that
i
his
only
son
would
never
be
called
upon
to
earn
a
living
for
myself
he
imagined
that
if
there
were
not
a
vacancy
for
me
on
the
great
southerton
estates
at
least
there
would
be
found
some
post
in
that
diplomatic
service
which
still
remains
the
special
preserve
of
our
privileged
classes
he
died
too
early
to
realize
how
false
his
calculations
had
been
neither
my
uncle
nor
the
state
took
the
slightest
notice
of
me
or
showed
any
interest
in
my
career
an
occasional
brace
of
pheasants
or
basket
of
hares
was
all
that
ever
reached
me
to
remind
me
that
i
was
heir
to
otwell
house
and
one
of
the
richest
estates
in
the
country
in
the
meantime
i
found
myself
a
bachelor
and
man
about
town
living
in
a
suite
of
apartments
in
grosvenor
mansions
with
no
occupation
save
that
of
pigeon-shooting
and
polo-playing
at
hurlingham
month
by
month
i
realized
that
it
was
more
and
more
difficult
to
get
the
brokers
to
renew
my
bills
or
to
cash
any
further
post-obits
upon
an
unentailed
property
ruin
lay
right
across
my
path
and
every
day
i
saw
it
clearer
nearer
and
more
absolutely
unavoidable
what
made
me
feel
my
own
poverty
the
more
was
that
apart
from
the
great
wealth
of
lord
southerton
all
my
other
relations
were
fairly
well-to-do
the
nearest
of
these
was
everard
king
my
father's
nephew
and
my
own
first
cousin
who
had
spent
an
adventurous
life
in
brazil
and
had
now
returned
to
this
country
to
settle
down
on
his
fortune
we
never
knew
how
he
made
his
money
but
he
appeared
to
have
plenty
of
it
for
he
bought
the
estate
of
greylands
near
clipton-on-the-marsh
in
suffolk
for
the
first
year
of
his
residence
in
england
he
took
no
more
notice
of
me
than
my
miserly
uncle
but
at
last
one
summer
morning
to
my
very
great
relief
and
joy
i
received
a
letter
asking
me
to
come
down
that
very
day
and
spend
a
short
visit
at
greylands
court
i
was
expecting
a
rather
long
visit
to
bankruptcy
court
at
the
time
and
this
interruption
seemed
almost
providential
if
i
could
only
get
on
terms
with
this
unknown
relative
of
mine
i
might
pull
through
yet
for
the
family
credit
he
could
not
let
me
go
entirely
to
the
wall
i
ordered
my
valet
to
pack
my
valise
and
i
set
off
the
same
evening
for
clipton-on-the-marsh
after
changing
at
ipswich
a
little
local
train
deposited
me
at
a
small
deserted
station
lying
amidst
a
rolling
grassy
country
with
a
sluggish
and
winding
river
curving
in
and
out
amidst
the
valleys
between
high
silted
banks
which
showed
that
we
were
within
reach
of
the
tide
no
carriage
was
awaiting
me
i
found
afterwards
that
my
telegram
had
been
delayed
so
i
hired
a
dogcart
at
the
local
inn
the
driver
an
excellent
fellow
was
full
of
my
relative's
praises
and
i
learned
from
him
that
mr
everard
king
was
already
a
name
to
conjure
with
in
that
part
of
the
county
he
had
entertained
the
school-children
he
had
thrown
his
grounds
open
to
visitors
he
had
subscribed
to
charities--in
short
his
benevolence
had
been
so
universal
that
my
driver
could
only
account
for
it
on
the
supposition
that
he
had
parliamentary
ambitions
my
attention
was
drawn
away
from
my
driver's
panegyric
by
the
appearance
of
a
very
beautiful
bird
which
settled
on
a
telegraph-post
beside
the
road
at
first
i
thought
that
it
was
a
jay
but
it
was
larger
with
a
brighter
plumage
the
driver
accounted
for
its
presence
at
once
by
saying
that
it
belonged
to
the
very
man
whom
we
were
about
to
visit
it
seems
that
the
acclimatization
of
foreign
creatures
was
one
of
his
hobbies
and
that
he
had
brought
with
him
from
brazil
a
number
of
birds
and
beasts
which
he
was
endeavouring
to
rear
in
england
when
once
we
had
passed
the
gates
of
greylands
park
we
had
ample
evidence
of
this
taste
of
his
some
small
spotted
deer
a
curious
wild
pig
known
i
believe
as
a
peccary
a
gorgeously
feathered
oriole
some
sort
of
armadillo
and
a
singular
lumbering
in-toed
beast
like
a
very
fat
badger
were
among
the
creatures
which
i
observed
as
we
drove
along
the
winding
avenue
mr
everard
king
my
unknown
cousin
was
standing
in
person
upon
the
steps
of
his
house
for
he
had
seen
us
in
the
distance
and
guessed
that
it
was
i
his
appearance
was
very
homely
and
benevolent
short
and
stout
forty-five
years
old
perhaps
with
a
round
good-humoured
face
burned
brown
with
the
tropical
sun
and
shot
with
a
thousand
wrinkles
he
wore
white
linen
clothes
in
true
planter
style
with
a
cigar
between
his
lips
and
a
large
panama
hat
upon
the
back
of
his
head
it
was
such
a
figure
as
one
associates
with
a
verandahed
bungalow
and
it
looked
curiously
out
of
place
in
front
of
this
broad
stone
english
mansion
with
its
solid
wings
and
its
palladio
pillars
before
the
doorway
my
dear
he
cried
glancing
over
his
shoulder
my
dear
here
is
our
guest
welcome
welcome
to
greylands
i
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
cousin
marshall
and
i
take
it
as
a
great
compliment
that
you
should
honour
this
sleepy
little
country
place
with
your
presence
nothing
could
be
more
hearty
than
his
manner
and
he
set
me
at
my
ease
in
an
instant
but
it
needed
all
his
cordiality
to
atone
for
the
frigidity
and
even
rudeness
of
his
wife
a
tall
haggard
woman
who
came
forward
at
his
summons
she
was
i
believe
of
brazilian
extraction
though
she
spoke
excellent
english
and
i
excused
her
manners
on
the
score
of
her
ignorance
of
our
customs
she
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
however
either
then
or
afterwards
that
i
was
no
very
welcome
visitor
at
greylands
court
her
actual
words
were
as
a
rule
courteous
but
she
was
the
possessor
of
a
pair
of
particularly
expressive
dark
eyes
and
i
read
in
them
very
clearly
from
the
first
that
she
heartily
wished
me
back
in
london
once
more
however
my
debts
were
too
pressing
and
my
designs
upon
my
wealthy
relative
were
too
vital
for
me
to
allow
them
to
be
upset
by
the
ill-temper
of
his
wife
so
i
disregarded
her
coldness
and
reciprocated
the
extreme
cordiality
of
his
welcome
no
pains
had
been
spared
by
him
to
make
me
comfortable
my
room
was
a
charming
one
he
implored
me
to
tell
him
anything
which
could
add
to
my
happiness
it
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
inform
him
that
a
blank
cheque
would
materially
help
towards
that
end
but
i
felt
that
it
might
be
premature
in
the
present
state
of
our
acquaintance
the
dinner
was
excellent
and
as
we
sat
together
afterwards
over
his
havanas
and
coffee
which
later
he
told
me
was
specially
prepared
upon
his
own
plantation
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
my
driver's
eulogies
were
justified
and
that
i
had
never
met
a
more
large-hearted
and
hospitable
man
but
in
spite
of
his
cheery
good
nature
he
was
a
man
with
a
strong
will
and
a
fiery
temper
of
his
own
of
this
i
had
an
example
upon
the
following
morning
the
curious
aversion
which
mrs
everard
king
had
conceived
towards
me
was
so
strong
that
her
manner
at
breakfast
was
almost
offensive
but
her
meaning
became
unmistakable
when
her
husband
had
quitted
the
room
the
best
train
in
the
day
is
at
twelve-fifteen
said
she
but
i
was
not
thinking
of
going
today
i
answered
frankly--perhaps
even
defiantly
for
i
was
determined
not
to
be
driven
out
by
this
woman
oh
if
it
rests
with
you--
said
she
and
stopped
with
a
most
insolent
expression
in
her
eyes
i
am
sure
i
answered
that
mr
everard
king
would
tell
me
if
i
were
outstaying
my
welcome
what's
this
what's
this
said
a
voice
and
there
he
was
in
the
room
he
had
overheard
my
last
words
and
a
glance
at
our
faces
had
told
him
the
rest
in
an
instant
his
chubby
cheery
face
set
into
an
expression
of
absolute
ferocity
might
i
trouble
you
to
walk
outside
marshall
said
he
i
may
mention
that
my
own
name
is
marshall
king
he
closed
the
door
behind
me
and
then
for
an
instant
i
heard
him
talking
in
a
low
voice
of
concentrated
passion
to
his
wife
this
gross
breach
of
hospitality
had
evidently
hit
upon
his
tenderest
point
i
am
no
eavesdropper
so
i
walked
out
on
to
the
lawn
presently
i
heard
a
hurried
step
behind
me
and
there
was
the
lady
her
face
pale
with
excitement
and
her
eyes
red
with
tears
my
husband
has
asked
me
to
apologize
to
you
mr
marshall
king
said
she
standing
with
downcast
eyes
before
me
please
do
not
say
another
word
mrs
king
her
dark
eyes
suddenly
blazed
out
at
me
you
fool
she
hissed
with
frantic
vehemence
and
turning
on
her
heel
swept
back
to
the
house
the
insult
was
so
outrageous
so
insufferable
that
i
could
only
stand
staring
after
her
in
bewilderment
i
was
still
there
when
my
host
joined
me
he
was
his
cheery
chubby
self
once
more
i
hope
that
my
wife
has
apologized
for
her
foolish
remarks
said
he
oh
yes--yes
certainly
he
put
his
hand
through
my
arm
and
walked
with
me
up
and
down
the
lawn
you
must
not
take
it
seriously
said
he
it
would
grieve
me
inexpressibly
if
you
curtailed
your
visit
by
one
hour
the
fact
is--there
is
no
reason
why
there
should
be
any
concealment
between
relatives--that
my
poor
dear
wife
is
incredibly
jealous
she
hates
that
anyone--male
or
female--should
for
an
instant
come
between
us
her
ideal
is
a
desert
island
and
an
eternal
tete-a-tete
that
gives
you
the
clue
to
her
actions
which
are
i
confess
upon
this
particular
point
not
very
far
removed
from
mania
tell
me
that
you
will
think
no
more
of
it
no
no
certainly
not
then
light
this
cigar
and
come
round
with
me
and
see
my
little
menagerie
the
whole
afternoon
was
occupied
by
this
inspection
which
included
all
the
birds
beasts
and
even
reptiles
which
he
had
imported
some
were
free
some
in
cages
a
few
actually
in
the
house
he
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
his
successes
and
his
failures
his
births
and
his
deaths
and
he
would
cry
out
in
his
delight
like
a
schoolboy
when
as
we
walked
some
gaudy
bird
would
flutter
up
from
the
grass
or
some
curious
beast
slink
into
the
cover
finally
he
led
me
down
a
corridor
which
extended
from
one
wing
of
the
house
at
the
end
of
this
there
was
a
heavy
door
with
a
sliding
shutter
in
it
and
beside
it
there
projected
from
the
wall
an
iron
handle
attached
to
a
wheel
and
a
drum
a
line
of
stout
bars
extended
across
the
passage
i
am
about
to
show
you
the
jewel
of
my
collection
said
he
there
is
only
one
other
specimen
in
europe
now
that
the
rotterdam
cub
is
dead
it
is
a
brazilian
cat
but
how
does
that
differ
from
any
other
cat
you
will
soon
see
that
said
he
laughing
will
you
kindly
draw
that
shutter
and
look
through
i
did
so
and
found
that
i
was
gazing
into
a
large
empty
room
with
stone
flags
and
small
barred
windows
upon
the
farther
wall
in
the
centre
of
this
room
lying
in
the
middle
of
a
golden
patch
of
sunlight
there
was
stretched
a
huge
creature
as
large
as
a
tiger
but
as
black
and
sleek
as
ebony
it
was
simply
a
very
enormous
and
very
well-kept
black
cat
and
it
cuddled
up
and
basked
in
that
yellow
pool
of
light
exactly
as
a
cat
would
do
it
was
so
graceful
so
sinewy
and
so
gently
and
smoothly
diabolical
that
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
from
the
opening
isn't
he
splendid
said
my
host
enthusiastically
glorious
i
never
saw
such
a
noble
creature
some
people
call
it
a
black
puma
but
really
it
is
not
a
puma
at
all
that
fellow
is
nearly
eleven
feet
from
tail
to
tip
four
years
ago
he
was
a
little
ball
of
black
fluff
with
two
yellow
eyes
staring
out
of
it
he
was
sold
me
as
a
new-born
cub
up
in
the
wild
country
at
the
head-waters
of
the
rio
negro
they
speared
his
mother
to
death
after
she
had
killed
a
dozen
of
them
they
are
ferocious
then
the
most
absolutely
treacherous
and
bloodthirsty
creatures
upon
earth
you
talk
about
a
brazilian
cat
to
an
up-country
indian
and
see
him
get
the
jumps
they
prefer
humans
to
game
this
fellow
has
never
tasted
living
blood
yet
but
when
he
does
he
will
be
a
terror
at
present
he
won't
stand
anyone
but
me
in
his
den
even
baldwin
the
groom
dare
not
go
near
him
as
to
me
i
am
his
mother
and
father
in
one
as
he
spoke
he
suddenly
to
my
astonishment
opened
the
door
and
slipped
in
closing
it
instantly
behind
him
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
huge
lithe
creature
rose
yawned
and
rubbed
its
round
black
head
affectionately
against
his
side
while
he
patted
and
fondled
it
now
tommy
into
your
cage
said
he
the
monstrous
cat
walked
over
to
one
side
of
the
room
and
coiled
itself
up
under
a
grating
everard
king
came
out
and
taking
the
iron
handle
which
i
have
mentioned
he
began
to
turn
it
as
he
did
so
the
line
of
bars
in
the
corridor
began
to
pass
through
a
slot
in
the
wall
and
closed
up
the
front
of
this
grating
so
as
to
make
an
effective
cage
when
it
was
in
position
he
opened
the
door
once
more
and
invited
me
into
the
room
which
was
heavy
with
the
pungent
musty
smell
peculiar
to
the
great
carnivora
that's
how
we
work
it
said
he
we
give
him
the
run
of
the
room
for
exercise
and
then
at
night
we
put
him
in
his
cage
you
can
let
him
out
by
turning
the
handle
from
the
passage
or
you
can
as
you
have
seen
coop
him
up
in
the
same
way
no
no
you
should
not
do
that
i
had
put
my
hand
between
the
bars
to
pat
the
glossy
heaving
flank
he
pulled
it
back
with
a
serious
face
i
assure
you
that
he
is
not
safe
don't
imagine
that
because
i
can
take
liberties
with
him
anyone
else
can
he
is
very
exclusive
in
his
friends--aren't
you
tommy
ah
he
hears
his
lunch
coming
to
him
don't
you
boy
a
step
sounded
in
the
stone-flagged
passage
and
the
creature
had
sprung
to
his
feet
and
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
narrow
cage
his
yellow
eyes
gleaming
and
his
scarlet
tongue
rippling
and
quivering
over
the
white
line
of
his
jagged
teeth
a
groom
entered
with
a
coarse
joint
upon
a
tray
and
thrust
it
through
the
bars
to
him
he
pounced
lightly
upon
it
carried
it
off
to
the
corner
and
there
holding
it
between
his
paws
tore
and
wrenched
at
it
raising
his
bloody
muzzle
every
now
and
then
to
look
at
us
it
was
a
malignant
and
yet
fascinating
sight
you
can't
wonder
that
i
am
fond
of
him
can
you
said
my
host
as
we
left
the
room
especially
when
you
consider
that
i
have
had
the
rearing
of
him
it
was
no
joke
bringing
him
over
from
the
centre
of
south
america
but
here
he
is
safe
and
sound--and
as
i
have
said
far
the
most
perfect
specimen
in
europe
the
people
at
the
zoo
are
dying
to
have
him
but
i
really
can't
part
with
him
now
i
think
that
i
have
inflicted
my
hobby
upon
you
long
enough
so
we
cannot
do
better
than
follow
tommy's
example
and
go
to
our
lunch
my
south
american
relative
was
so
engrossed
by
his
grounds
and
their
curious
occupants
that
i
hardly
gave
him
credit
at
first
for
having
any
interests
outside
them
that
he
had
some
and
pressing
ones
was
soon
borne
in
upon
me
by
the
number
of
telegrams
which
he
received
they
arrived
at
all
hours
and
were
always
opened
by
him
with
the
utmost
eagerness
and
anxiety
upon
his
face
sometimes
i
imagined
that
it
must
be
the
turf
and
sometimes
the
stock
exchange
but
certainly
he
had
some
very
urgent
business
going
forwards
which
was
not
transacted
upon
the
downs
of
suffolk
during
the
six
days
of
my
visit
he
had
never
fewer
than
three
or
four
telegrams
a
day
and
sometimes
as
many
as
seven
or
eight
i
had
occupied
these
six
days
so
well
that
by
the
end
of
them
i
had
succeeded
in
getting
upon
the
most
cordial
terms
with
my
cousin
every
night
we
had
sat
up
late
in
the
billiard-room
he
telling
me
the
most
extraordinary
stories
of
his
adventures
in
america--stories
so
desperate
and
reckless
that
i
could
hardly
associate
them
with
the
brown
little
chubby
man
before
me
in
return
i
ventured
upon
some
of
my
own
reminiscences
of
london
life
which
interested
him
so
much
that
he
vowed
he
would
come
up
to
grosvenor
mansions
and
stay
with
me
he
was
anxious
to
see
the
faster
side
of
city
life
and
certainly
though
i
say
it
he
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
competent
guide
it
was
not
until
the
last
day
of
my
visit
that
i
ventured
to
approach
that
which
was
on
my
mind
i
told
him
frankly
about
my
pecuniary
difficulties
and
my
impending
ruin
and
i
asked
his
advice--though
i
hoped
for
something
more
solid
he
listened
attentively
puffing
hard
at
his
cigar
but
surely
said
he
you
are
the
heir
of
our
relative
lord
southerton
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
so
but
he
would
never
make
me
any
allowance
no
no
i
have
heard
of
his
miserly
ways
my
poor
marshall
your
position
has
been
a
very
hard
one
by
the
way
have
you
heard
any
news
of
lord
southerton's
health
lately
he
has
always
been
in
a
critical
condition
ever
since
my
childhood
exactly--a
creaking
hinge
if
ever
there
was
one
your
inheritance
may
be
a
long
way
off
dear
me
how
awkwardly
situated
you
are
i
had
some
hopes
sir
that
you
knowing
all
the
facts
might
be
inclined
to
advance----
don't
say
another
word
my
dear
boy
he
cried
with
the
utmost
cordiality
we
shall
talk
it
over
tonight
and
i
give
you
my
word
that
whatever
is
in
my
power
shall
be
done
i
was
not
sorry
that
my
visit
was
drawing
to
a
close
for
it
is
unpleasant
to
feel
that
there
is
one
person
in
the
house
who
eagerly
desires
your
departure
mrs
king's
sallow
face
and
forbidding
eyes
had
become
more
and
more
hateful
to
me
she
was
no
longer
actively
rude--her
fear
of
her
husband
prevented
her--but
she
pushed
her
insane
jealousy
to
the
extent
of
ignoring
me
never
addressing
me
and
in
every
way
making
my
stay
at
greylands
as
uncomfortable
as
she
could
so
offensive
was
her
manner
during
that
last
day
that
i
should
certainly
have
left
had
it
not
been
for
that
interview
with
my
host
in
the
evening
which
would
i
hoped
retrieve
my
broken
fortunes
it
was
very
late
when
it
occurred
for
my
relative
who
had
been
receiving
even
more
telegrams
than
usual
during
the
day
went
off
to
his
study
after
dinner
and
only
emerged
when
the
household
had
retired
to
bed
i
heard
him
go
round
locking
the
doors
as
custom
was
of
a
night
and
finally
he
joined
me
in
the
billiard-room
his
stout
figure
was
wrapped
in
a
dressing-gown
and
he
wore
a
pair
of
red
turkish
slippers
without
any
heels
settling
down
into
an
arm-chair
he
brewed
himself
a
glass
of
grog
in
which
i
could
not
help
noticing
that
the
whisky
considerably
predominated
over
the
water
my
word
said
he
what
a
night
it
was
indeed
the
wind
was
howling
and
screaming
round
the
house
and
the
latticed
windows
rattled
and
shook
as
if
they
were
coming
in
the
glow
of
the
yellow
lamps
and
the
flavour
of
our
cigars
seemed
the
brighter
and
more
fragrant
for
the
contrast
now
my
boy
said
my
host
we
have
the
house
and
the
night
to
ourselves
let
me
have
an
idea
of
how
your
affairs
stand
and
i
will
see
what
can
be
done
to
set
them
in
order
i
wish
to
hear
every
detail
thus
encouraged
i
entered
into
a
long
exposition
in
which
all
my
tradesmen
and
creditors
from
my
landlord
to
my
valet
figured
in
turn
i
had
notes
in
my
pocket-book
and
i
marshalled
my
facts
and
gave
i
flatter
myself
a
very
businesslike
statement
of
my
own
unbusinesslike
ways
and
lamentable
position
i
was
depressed
however
to
notice
that
my
companion's
eyes
were
vacant
and
his
attention
elsewhere
when
he
did
occasionally
throw
out
a
remark
it
was
so
entirely
perfunctory
and
pointless
that
i
was
sure
he
had
not
in
the
least
followed
my
remarks
every
now
and
then
he
roused
himself
and
put
on
some
show
of
interest
asking
me
to
repeat
or
to
explain
more
fully
but
it
was
always
to
sink
once
more
into
the
same
brown
study
at
last
he
rose
and
threw
the
end
of
his
cigar
into
the
grate
i'll
tell
you
what
my
boy
said
he
i
never
had
a
head
for
figures
so
you
will
excuse
me
you
must
jot
it
all
down
upon
paper
and
let
me
have
a
note
of
the
amount
i'll
understand
it
when
i
see
it
in
black
and
white
the
proposal
was
encouraging
i
promised
to
do
so
and
now
it's
time
we
were
in
bed
by
jove
there's
one
o'clock
striking
in
the
hall
the
tingling
of
the
chiming
clock
broke
through
the
deep
roar
of
the
gale
the
wind
was
sweeping
past
with
the
rush
of
a
great
river
i
must
see
my
cat
before
i
go
to
bed
said
my
host
a
high
wind
excites
him
will
you
come
certainly
said
i
then
tread
softly
and
don't
speak
for
everyone
is
asleep
we
passed
quietly
down
the
lamp-lit
persian-rugged
hall
and
through
the
door
at
the
farther
end
all
was
dark
in
the
stone
corridor
but
a
stable
lantern
hung
on
a
hook
and
my
host
took
it
down
and
lit
it
there
was
no
grating
visible
in
the
passage
so
i
knew
that
the
beast
was
in
its
cage
come
in
said
my
relative
and
opened
the
door
a
deep
growling
as
we
entered
showed
that
the
storm
had
really
excited
the
creature
in
the
flickering
light
of
the
lantern
we
saw
it
a
huge
black
mass
coiled
in
the
corner
of
its
den
and
throwing
a
squat
uncouth
shadow
upon
the
whitewashed
wall
its
tail
switched
angrily
among
the
straw
poor
tommy
is
not
in
the
best
of
tempers
said
everard
king
holding
up
the
lantern
and
looking
in
at
him
what
a
black
devil
he
looks
doesn't
he
i
must
give
him
a
little
supper
to
put
him
in
a
better
humour
would
you
mind
holding
the
lantern
for
a
moment
i
took
it
from
his
hand
and
he
stepped
to
the
door
his
larder
is
just
outside
here
said
he
you
will
excuse
me
for
an
instant
won't
you
he
passed
out
and
the
door
shut
with
a
sharp
metallic
click
behind
him
that
hard
crisp
sound
made
my
heart
stand
still
a
sudden
wave
of
terror
passed
over
me
a
vague
perception
of
some
monstrous
treachery
turned
me
cold
i
sprang
to
the
door
but
there
was
no
handle
upon
the
inner
side
here
i
cried
let
me
out
all
right
don't
make
a
row
said
my
host
from
the
passage
you've
got
the
light
all
right
yes
but
i
don't
care
about
being
locked
in
alone
like
this
don't
you
i
heard
his
hearty
chuckling
laugh
you
won't
be
alone
long
let
me
out
sir
i
repeated
angrily
i
tell
you
i
don't
allow
practical
jokes
of
this
sort
practical
is
the
word
said
he
with
another
hateful
chuckle
and
then
suddenly
i
heard
amidst
the
roar
of
the
storm
the
creak
and
whine
of
the
winch-handle
turning
and
the
rattle
of
the
grating
as
it
passed
through
the
slot
great
god
he
was
letting
loose
the
brazilian
cat
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
i
saw
the
bars
sliding
slowly
before
me
already
there
was
an
opening
a
foot
wide
at
the
farther
end
with
a
scream
i
seized
the
last
bar
with
my
hands
and
pulled
with
the
strength
of
a
madman
i
was
a
madman
with
rage
and
horror
for
a
minute
or
more
i
held
the
thing
motionless
i
knew
that
he
was
straining
with
all
his
force
upon
the
handle
and
that
the
leverage
was
sure
to
overcome
me
i
gave
inch
by
inch
my
feet
sliding
along
the
stones
and
all
the
time
i
begged
and
prayed
this
inhuman
monster
to
save
me
from
this
horrible
death
i
conjured
him
by
his
kinship
i
reminded
him
that
i
was
his
guest
i
begged
to
know
what
harm
i
had
ever
done
him
his
only
answers
were
the
tugs
and
jerks
upon
the
handle
each
of
which
in
spite
of
all
my
struggles
pulled
another
bar
through
the
opening
clinging
and
clutching
i
was
dragged
across
the
whole
front
of
the
cage
until
at
last
with
aching
wrists
and
lacerated
fingers
i
gave
up
the
hopeless
struggle
the
grating
clanged
back
as
i
released
it
and
an
instant
later
i
heard
the
shuffle
of
the
turkish
slippers
in
the
passage
and
the
slam
of
the
distant
door
then
everything
was
silent
the
creature
had
never
moved
during
this
time
he
lay
still
in
the
corner
and
his
tail
had
ceased
switching
this
apparition
of
a
man
adhering
to
his
bars
and
dragged
screaming
across
him
had
apparently
filled
him
with
amazement
i
saw
his
great
eyes
staring
steadily
at
me
i
had
dropped
the
lantern
when
i
seized
the
bars
but
it
still
burned
upon
the
floor
and
i
made
a
movement
to
grasp
it
with
some
idea
that
its
light
might
protect
me
but
the
instant
i
moved
the
beast
gave
a
deep
and
menacing
growl
i
stopped
and
stood
still
quivering
with
fear
in
every
limb
the
cat
if
one
may
call
so
fearful
a
creature
by
so
homely
a
name
was
not
more
than
ten
feet
from
me
the
eyes
glimmered
like
two
disks
of
phosphorus
in
the
darkness
they
appalled
and
yet
fascinated
me
i
could
not
take
my
own
eyes
from
them
nature
plays
strange
tricks
with
us
at
such
moments
of
intensity
and
those
glimmering
lights
waxed
and
waned
with
a
steady
rise
and
fall
sometimes
they
seemed
to
be
tiny
points
of
extreme
brilliancy--little
electric
sparks
in
the
black
obscurity--then
they
would
widen
and
widen
until
all
that
corner
of
the
room
was
filled
with
their
shifting
and
sinister
light
and
then
suddenly
they
went
out
altogether
the
beast
had
closed
its
eyes
i
do
not
know
whether
there
may
be
any
truth
in
the
old
idea
of
the
dominance
of
the
human
gaze
or
whether
the
huge
cat
was
simply
drowsy
but
the
fact
remains
that
far
from
showing
any
symptom
of
attacking
me
it
simply
rested
its
sleek
black
head
upon
its
huge
forepaws
and
seemed
to
sleep
i
stood
fearing
to
move
lest
i
should
rouse
it
into
malignant
life
once
more
but
at
least
i
was
able
to
think
clearly
now
that
the
baleful
eyes
were
off
me
here
i
was
shut
up
for
the
night
with
the
ferocious
beast
my
own
instincts
to
say
nothing
of
the
words
of
the
plausible
villain
who
laid
this
trap
for
me
warned
me
that
the
animal
was
as
savage
as
its
master
how
could
i
stave
it
off
until
morning
the
door
was
hopeless
and
so
were
the
narrow
barred
windows
there
was
no
shelter
anywhere
in
the
bare
stone-flagged
room
to
cry
for
assistance
was
absurd
i
knew
that
this
den
was
an
outhouse
and
that
the
corridor
which
connected
it
with
the
house
was
at
least
a
hundred
feet
long
besides
with
the
gale
thundering
outside
my
cries
were
not
likely
to
be
heard
i
had
only
my
own
courage
and
my
own
wits
to
trust
to
and
then
with
a
fresh
wave
of
horror
my
eyes
fell
upon
the
lantern
the
candle
had
burned
low
and
was
already
beginning
to
gutter
in
ten
minutes
it
would
be
out
i
had
only
ten
minutes
then
in
which
to
do
something
for
i
felt
that
if
i
were
once
left
in
the
dark
with
that
fearful
beast
i
should
be
incapable
of
action
the
very
thought
of
it
paralysed
me
i
cast
my
despairing
eyes
round
this
chamber
of
death
and
they
rested
upon
one
spot
which
seemed
to
promise
i
will
not
say
safety
but
less
immediate
and
imminent
danger
than
the
open
floor
i
have
said
that
the
cage
had
a
top
as
well
as
a
front
and
this
top
was
left
standing
when
the
front
was
wound
through
the
slot
in
the
wall
it
consisted
of
bars
at
a
few
inches'
interval
with
stout
wire
netting
between
and
it
rested
upon
a
strong
stanchion
at
each
end
it
stood
now
as
a
great
barred
canopy
over
the
crouching
figure
in
the
corner
the
space
between
this
iron
shelf
and
the
roof
may
have
been
from
two
or
three
feet
if
i
could
only
get
up
there
squeezed
in
between
bars
and
ceiling
i
should
have
only
one
vulnerable
side
i
should
be
safe
from
below
from
behind
and
from
each
side
only
on
the
open
face
of
it
could
i
be
attacked
there
it
is
true
i
had
no
protection
whatever
but
at
least
i
should
be
out
of
the
brute's
path
when
he
began
to
pace
about
his
den
he
would
have
to
come
out
of
his
way
to
reach
me
it
was
now
or
never
for
if
once
the
light
were
out
it
would
be
impossible
with
a
gulp
in
my
throat
i
sprang
up
seized
the
iron
edge
of
the
top
and
swung
myself
panting
on
to
it
i
writhed
in
face
downwards
and
found
myself
looking
straight
into
the
terrible
eyes
and
yawning
jaws
of
the
cat
its
fetid
breath
came
up
into
my
face
like
the
steam
from
some
foul
pot
it
appeared
however
to
be
rather
curious
than
angry
with
a
sleek
ripple
of
its
long
black
back
it
rose
stretched
itself
and
then
rearing
itself
on
its
hind
legs
with
one
forepaw
against
the
wall
it
raised
the
other
and
drew
its
claws
across
the
wire
meshes
beneath
me
one
sharp
white
hook
tore
through
my
trousers--for
i
may
mention
that
i
was
still
in
evening
dress--and
dug
a
furrow
in
my
knee
it
was
not
meant
as
an
attack
but
rather
as
an
experiment
for
upon
my
giving
a
sharp
cry
of
pain
he
dropped
down
again
and
springing
lightly
into
the
room
he
began
walking
swiftly
round
it
looking
up
every
now
and
again
in
my
direction
for
my
part
i
shuffled
backwards
until
i
lay
with
my
back
against
the
wall
screwing
myself
into
the
smallest
space
possible
the
farther
i
got
the
more
difficult
it
was
for
him
to
attack
me
he
seemed
more
excited
now
that
he
had
begun
to
move
about
and
he
ran
swiftly
and
noiselessly
round
and
round
the
den
passing
continually
underneath
the
iron
couch
upon
which
i
lay
it
was
wonderful
to
see
so
great
a
bulk
passing
like
a
shadow
with
hardly
the
softest
thudding
of
velvety
pads
the
candle
was
burning
low--so
low
that
i
could
hardly
see
the
creature
and
then
with
a
last
flare
and
splutter
it
went
out
altogether
i
was
alone
with
the
cat
in
the
dark
it
helps
one
to
face
a
danger
when
one
knows
that
one
has
done
all
that
possibly
can
be
done
there
is
nothing
for
it
then
but
to
quietly
await
the
result
in
this
case
there
was
no
chance
of
safety
anywhere
except
the
precise
spot
where
i
was
i
stretched
myself
out
therefore
and
lay
silently
almost
breathlessly
hoping
that
the
beast
might
forget
my
presence
if
i
did
nothing
to
remind
him
i
reckoned
that
it
must
already
be
two
o'clock
at
four
it
would
be
full
dawn
i
had
not
more
than
two
hours
to
wait
for
daylight
outside
the
storm
was
still
raging
and
the
rain
lashed
continually
against
the
little
windows
inside
the
poisonous
and
fetid
air
was
overpowering
i
could
neither
hear
nor
see
the
cat
i
tried
to
think
about
other
things--but
only
one
had
power
enough
to
draw
my
mind
from
my
terrible
position
that
was
the
contemplation
of
my
cousin's
villainy
his
unparalleled
hypocrisy
his
malignant
hatred
of
me
beneath
that
cheerful
face
there
lurked
the
spirit
of
a
mediaeval
assassin
and
as
i
thought
of
it
i
saw
more
clearly
how
cunningly
the
thing
had
been
arranged
he
had
apparently
gone
to
bed
with
the
others
no
doubt
he
had
his
witness
to
prove
it
then
unknown
to
them
he
had
slipped
down
had
lured
me
into
his
den
and
abandoned
me
his
story
would
be
so
simple
he
had
left
me
to
finish
my
cigar
in
the
billiard-room
i
had
gone
down
on
my
own
account
to
have
a
last
look
at
the
cat
i
had
entered
the
room
without
observing
that
the
cage
was
opened
and
i
had
been
caught
how
could
such
a
crime
be
brought
home
to
him
suspicion
perhaps--but
proof
never
how
slowly
those
dreadful
two
hours
went
by
once
i
heard
a
low
rasping
sound
which
i
took
to
be
the
creature
licking
its
own
fur
several
times
those
greenish
eyes
gleamed
at
me
through
the
darkness
but
never
in
a
fixed
stare
and
my
hopes
grew
stronger
that
my
presence
had
been
forgotten
or
ignored
at
last
the
least
faint
glimmer
of
light
came
through
the
windows--i
first
dimly
saw
them
as
two
grey
squares
upon
the
black
wall
then
grey
turned
to
white
and
i
could
see
my
terrible
companion
once
more
and
he
alas
could
see
me
it
was
evident
to
me
at
once
that
he
was
in
a
much
more
dangerous
and
aggressive
mood
than
when
i
had
seen
him
last
the
cold
of
the
morning
had
irritated
him
and
he
was
hungry
as
well
with
a
continual
growl
he
paced
swiftly
up
and
down
the
side
of
the
room
which
was
farthest
from
my
refuge
his
whiskers
bristling
angrily
and
his
tail
switching
and
lashing
as
he
turned
at
the
corners
his
savage
eyes
always
looked
upwards
at
me
with
a
dreadful
menace
i
knew
then
that
he
meant
to
kill
me
yet
i
found
myself
even
at
that
moment
admiring
the
sinuous
grace
of
the
devilish
thing
its
long
undulating
rippling
movements
the
gloss
of
its
beautiful
flanks
the
vivid
palpitating
scarlet
of
the
glistening
tongue
which
hung
from
the
jet-black
muzzle
and
all
the
time
that
deep
threatening
growl
was
rising
and
rising
in
an
unbroken
crescendo
i
knew
that
the
crisis
was
at
hand
it
was
a
miserable
hour
to
meet
such
a
death--so
cold
so
comfortless
shivering
in
my
light
dress
clothes
upon
this
gridiron
of
torment
upon
which
i
was
stretched
i
tried
to
brace
myself
to
it
to
raise
my
soul
above
it
and
at
the
same
time
with
the
lucidity
which
comes
to
a
perfectly
desperate
man
i
cast
round
for
some
possible
means
of
escape
one
thing
was
clear
to
me
if
that
front
of
the
cage
was
only
back
in
its
position
once
more
i
could
find
a
sure
refuge
behind
it
could
i
possibly
pull
it
back
i
hardly
dared
to
move
for
fear
of
bringing
the
creature
upon
me
slowly
very
slowly
i
put
my
hand
forward
until
it
grasped
the
edge
of
the
front
the
final
bar
which
protruded
through
the
wall
to
my
surprise
it
came
quite
easily
to
my
jerk
of
course
the
difficulty
of
drawing
it
out
arose
from
the
fact
that
i
was
clinging
to
it
i
pulled
again
and
three
inches
of
it
came
through
it
ran
apparently
on
wheels
i
pulled
again

and
then
the
cat
sprang
it
was
so
quick
so
sudden
that
i
never
saw
it
happen
i
simply
heard
the
savage
snarl
and
in
an
instant
afterwards
the
blazing
yellow
eyes
the
flattened
black
head
with
its
red
tongue
and
flashing
teeth
were
within
reach
of
me
the
impact
of
the
creature
shook
the
bars
upon
which
i
lay
until
i
thought
as
far
as
i
could
think
of
anything
at
such
a
moment
that
they
were
coming
down
the
cat
swayed
there
for
an
instant
the
head
and
front
paws
quite
close
to
me
the
hind
paws
clawing
to
find
a
grip
upon
the
edge
of
the
grating
i
heard
the
claws
rasping
as
they
clung
to
the
wire-netting
and
the
breath
of
the
beast
made
me
sick
but
its
bound
had
been
miscalculated
it
could
not
retain
its
position
slowly
grinning
with
rage
and
scratching
madly
at
the
bars
it
swung
backwards
and
dropped
heavily
upon
the
floor
with
a
growl
it
instantly
faced
round
to
me
and
crouched
for
another
spring
i
knew
that
the
next
few
moments
would
decide
my
fate
the
creature
had
learned
by
experience
it
would
not
miscalculate
again
i
must
act
promptly
fearlessly
if
i
were
to
have
a
chance
for
life
in
an
instant
i
had
formed
my
plan
pulling
off
my
dress-coat
i
threw
it
down
over
the
head
of
the
beast
at
the
same
moment
i
dropped
over
the
edge
seized
the
end
of
the
front
grating
and
pulled
it
frantically
out
of
the
wall
it
came
more
easily
than
i
could
have
expected
i
rushed
across
the
room
bearing
it
with
me
but
as
i
rushed
the
accident
of
my
position
put
me
upon
the
outer
side
had
it
been
the
other
way
i
might
have
come
off
scathless
as
it
was
there
was
a
moment's
pause
as
i
stopped
it
and
tried
to
pass
in
through
the
opening
which
i
had
left
that
moment
was
enough
to
give
time
to
the
creature
to
toss
off
the
coat
with
which
i
had
blinded
him
and
to
spring
upon
me
i
hurled
myself
through
the
gap
and
pulled
the
rails
to
behind
me
but
he
seized
my
leg
before
i
could
entirely
withdraw
it
one
stroke
of
that
huge
paw
tore
off
my
calf
as
a
shaving
of
wood
curls
off
before
a
plane
the
next
moment
bleeding
and
fainting
i
was
lying
among
the
foul
straw
with
a
line
of
friendly
bars
between
me
and
the
creature
which
ramped
so
frantically
against
them
too
wounded
to
move
and
too
faint
to
be
conscious
of
fear
i
could
only
lie
more
dead
than
alive
and
watch
it
it
pressed
its
broad
black
chest
against
the
bars
and
angled
for
me
with
its
crooked
paws
as
i
have
seen
a
kitten
do
before
a
mouse-trap
it
ripped
my
clothes
but
stretch
as
it
would
it
could
not
quite
reach
me
i
have
heard
of
the
curious
numbing
effect
produced
by
wounds
from
the
great
carnivora
and
now
i
was
destined
to
experience
it
for
i
had
lost
all
sense
of
personality
and
was
as
interested
in
the
cat's
failure
or
success
as
if
it
were
some
game
which
i
was
watching
and
then
gradually
my
mind
drifted
away
into
strange
vague
dreams
always
with
that
black
face
and
red
tongue
coming
back
into
them
and
so
i
lost
myself
in
the
nirvana
of
delirium
the
blessed
relief
of
those
who
are
too
sorely
tried
tracing
the
course
of
events
afterwards
i
conclude
that
i
must
have
been
insensible
for
about
two
hours
what
roused
me
to
consciousness
once
more
was
that
sharp
metallic
click
which
had
been
the
precursor
of
my
terrible
experience
it
was
the
shooting
back
of
the
spring
lock
then
before
my
senses
were
clear
enough
to
entirely
apprehend
what
they
saw
i
was
aware
of
the
round
benevolent
face
of
my
cousin
peering
in
through
the
open
door
what
he
saw
evidently
amazed
him
there
was
the
cat
crouching
on
the
floor
i
was
stretched
upon
my
back
in
my
shirt-sleeves
within
the
cage
my
trousers
torn
to
ribbons
and
a
great
pool
of
blood
all
round
me
i
can
see
his
amazed
face
now
with
the
morning
sunlight
upon
it
he
peered
at
me
and
peered
again
then
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
advanced
to
the
cage
to
see
if
i
were
really
dead
i
cannot
undertake
to
say
what
happened
i
was
not
in
a
fit
state
to
witness
or
to
chronicle
such
events
i
can
only
say
that
i
was
suddenly
conscious
that
his
face
was
away
from
me--that
he
was
looking
towards
the
animal
good
old
tommy
he
cried
good
old
tommy
then
he
came
near
the
bars
with
his
back
still
towards
me
down
you
stupid
beast
he
roared
down
sir
don't
you
know
your
master
suddenly
even
in
my
bemuddled
brain
a
remembrance
came
of
those
words
of
his
when
he
had
said
that
the
taste
of
blood
would
turn
the
cat
into
a
fiend
my
blood
had
done
it
but
he
was
to
pay
the
price
get
away
he
screamed
get
away
you
devil
baldwin
baldwin
oh
my
god
and
then
i
heard
him
fall
and
rise
and
fall
again
with
a
sound
like
the
ripping
of
sacking
his
screams
grew
fainter
until
they
were
lost
in
the
worrying
snarl
and
then
after
i
thought
that
he
was
dead
i
saw
as
in
a
nightmare
a
blinded
tattered
blood-soaked
figure
running
wildly
round
the
room--and
that
was
the
last
glimpse
which
i
had
of
him
before
i
fainted
once
again
i
was
many
months
in
my
recovery--in
fact
i
cannot
say
that
i
have
ever
recovered
for
to
the
end
of
my
days
i
shall
carry
a
stick
as
a
sign
of
my
night
with
the
brazilian
cat
baldwin
the
groom
and
the
other
servants
could
not
tell
what
had
occurred
when
drawn
by
the
death-cries
of
their
master
they
found
me
behind
the
bars
and
his
remains--or
what
they
afterwards
discovered
to
be
his
remains--in
the
clutch
of
the
creature
which
he
had
reared
they
stalled
him
off
with
hot
irons
and
afterwards
shot
him
through
the
loophole
of
the
door
before
they
could
finally
extricate
me
i
was
carried
to
my
bedroom
and
there
under
the
roof
of
my
would-be
murderer
i
remained
between
life
and
death
for
several
weeks
they
had
sent
for
a
surgeon
from
clipton
and
a
nurse
from
london
and
in
a
month
i
was
able
to
be
carried
to
the
station
and
so
conveyed
back
once
more
to
grosvenor
mansions
i
have
one
remembrance
of
that
illness
which
might
have
been
part
of
the
ever-changing
panorama
conjured
up
by
a
delirious
brain
were
it
not
so
definitely
fixed
in
my
memory
one
night
when
the
nurse
was
absent
the
door
of
my
chamber
opened
and
a
tall
woman
in
blackest
mourning
slipped
into
the
room
she
came
across
to
me
and
as
she
bent
her
sallow
face
i
saw
by
the
faint
gleam
of
the
night-light
that
it
was
the
brazilian
woman
whom
my
cousin
had
married
she
stared
intently
into
my
face
and
her
expression
was
more
kindly
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
are
you
conscious
she
asked
i
feebly
nodded--for
i
was
still
very
weak
well
then
i
only
wished
to
say
to
you
that
you
have
yourself
to
blame
did
i
not
do
all
i
could
for
you
from
the
beginning
i
tried
to
drive
you
from
the
house
by
every
means
short
of
betraying
my
husband
i
tried
to
save
you
from
him
i
knew
that
he
had
a
reason
for
bringing
you
here
i
knew
that
he
would
never
let
you
get
away
again
no
one
knew
him
as
i
knew
him
who
had
suffered
from
him
so
often
i
did
not
dare
to
tell
you
all
this
he
would
have
killed
me
but
i
did
my
best
for
you
as
things
have
turned
out
you
have
been
the
best
friend
that
i
have
ever
had
you
have
set
me
free
and
i
fancied
that
nothing
but
death
would
do
that
i
am
sorry
if
you
are
hurt
but
i
cannot
reproach
myself
i
told
you
that
you
were
a
fool--and
a
fool
you
have
been
she
crept
out
of
the
room
the
bitter
singular
woman
and
i
was
never
destined
to
see
her
again
with
what
remained
from
her
husband's
property
she
went
back
to
her
native
land
and
i
have
heard
that
she
afterwards
took
the
veil
at
pernambuco
it
was
not
until
i
had
been
back
in
london
for
some
time
that
the
doctors
pronounced
me
to
be
well
enough
to
do
business
it
was
not
a
very
welcome
permission
to
me
for
i
feared
that
it
would
be
the
signal
for
an
inrush
of
creditors
but
it
was
summers
my
lawyer
who
first
took
advantage
of
it
i
am
very
glad
to
see
that
your
lordship
is
so
much
better
said
he
i
have
been
waiting
a
long
time
to
offer
my
congratulations
what
do
you
mean
summers
this
is
no
time
for
joking
i
mean
what
i
say
he
answered
you
have
been
lord
southerton
for
the
last
six
weeks
but
we
feared
that
it
would
retard
your
recovery
if
you
were
to
learn
it
lord
southerton
one
of
the
richest
peers
in
england
i
could
not
believe
my
ears
and
then
suddenly
i
thought
of
the
time
which
had
elapsed
and
how
it
coincided
with
my
injuries
then
lord
southerton
must
have
died
about
the
same
time
that
i
was
hurt
his
death
occurred
upon
that
very
day
summers
looked
hard
at
me
as
i
spoke
and
i
am
convinced--for
he
was
a
very
shrewd
fellow--that
he
had
guessed
the
true
state
of
the
case
he
paused
for
a
moment
as
if
awaiting
a
confidence
from
me
but
i
could
not
see
what
was
to
be
gained
by
exposing
such
a
family
scandal
yes
a
very
curious
coincidence
he
continued
with
the
same
knowing
look
of
course
you
are
aware
that
your
cousin
everard
king
was
the
next
heir
to
the
estates
now
if
it
had
been
you
instead
of
him
who
had
been
torn
to
pieces
by
this
tiger
or
whatever
it
was
then
of
course
he
would
have
been
lord
southerton
at
the
present
moment
no
doubt
said
i
and
he
took
such
an
interest
in
it
said
summers
i
happen
to
know
that
the
late
lord
southerton's
valet
was
in
his
pay
and
that
he
used
to
have
telegrams
from
him
every
few
hours
to
tell
him
how
he
was
getting
on
that
would
be
about
the
time
when
you
were
down
there
was
it
not
strange
that
he
should
wish
to
be
so
well
informed
since
he
knew
that
he
was
not
the
direct
heir
very
strange
said
i
and
now
summers
if
you
will
bring
me
my
bills
and
a
new
cheque-book
we
will
begin
to
get
things
into
order
tales
of
mystery
the
lost
special
the
confession
of
herbert
de
lernac
now
lying
under
sentence
of
death
at
marseilles
has
thrown
a
light
upon
one
of
the
most
inexplicable
crimes
of
the
century--an
incident
which
is
i
believe
absolutely
unprecedented
in
the
criminal
annals
of
any
country
although
there
is
a
reluctance
to
discuss
the
matter
in
official
circles
and
little
information
has
been
given
to
the
press
there
are
still
indications
that
the
statement
of
this
arch-criminal
is
corroborated
by
the
facts
and
that
we
have
at
last
found
a
solution
for
a
most
astounding
business
as
the
matter
is
eight
years
old
and
as
its
importance
was
somewhat
obscured
by
a
political
crisis
which
was
engaging
the
public
attention
at
the
time
it
may
be
as
well
to
state
the
facts
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain
them
they
are
collated
from
the
liverpool
papers
of
that
date
from
the
proceedings
at
the
inquest
upon
john
slater
the
engine-driver
and
from
the
records
of
the
london
and
west
coast
railway
company
which
have
been
courteously
put
at
my
disposal
briefly
they
are
as
follows
on
the
3rd
of
june
1890
a
gentleman
who
gave
his
name
as
monsieur
louis
caratal
desired
an
interview
with
mr
james
bland
the
superintendent
of
the
london
and
west
coast
central
station
in
liverpool
he
was
a
small
man
middle-aged
and
dark
with
a
stoop
which
was
so
marked
that
it
suggested
some
deformity
of
the
spine
he
was
accompanied
by
a
friend
a
man
of
imposing
physique
whose
deferential
manner
and
constant
attention
showed
that
his
position
was
one
of
dependence
this
friend
or
companion
whose
name
did
not
transpire
was
certainly
a
foreigner
and
probably
from
his
swarthy
complexion
either
a
spaniard
or
a
south
american
one
peculiarity
was
observed
in
him
he
carried
in
his
left
hand
a
small
black
leather
dispatch
box
and
it
was
noticed
by
a
sharp-eyed
clerk
in
the
central
office
that
this
box
was
fastened
to
his
wrist
by
a
strap
no
importance
was
attached
to
the
fact
at
the
time
but
subsequent
events
endowed
it
with
some
significance
monsieur
caratal
was
shown
up
to
mr
bland's
office
while
his
companion
remained
outside
monsieur
caratal's
business
was
quickly
dispatched
he
had
arrived
that
afternoon
from
central
america
affairs
of
the
utmost
importance
demanded
that
he
should
be
in
paris
without
the
loss
of
an
unnecessary
hour
he
had
missed
the
london
express
a
special
must
be
provided
money
was
of
no
importance
time
was
everything
if
the
company
would
speed
him
on
his
way
they
might
make
their
own
terms
mr
bland
struck
the
electric
bell
summoned
mr
potter
hood
the
traffic
manager
and
had
the
matter
arranged
in
five
minutes
the
train
would
start
in
three-quarters
of
an
hour
it
would
take
that
time
to
insure
that
the
line
should
be
clear
the
powerful
engine
called
rochdale
no
247
on
the
company's
register
was
attached
to
two
carriages
with
a
guard's
van
behind
the
first
carriage
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
decreasing
the
inconvenience
arising
from
the
oscillation
the
second
was
divided
as
usual
into
four
compartments
a
first-class
a
first-class
smoking
a
second-class
and
a
second-class
smoking
the
first
compartment
which
was
nearest
to
the
engine
was
the
one
allotted
to
the
travellers
the
other
three
were
empty
the
guard
of
the
special
train
was
james
mcpherson
who
had
been
some
years
in
the
service
of
the
company
the
stoker
william
smith
was
a
new
hand
monsieur
caratal
upon
leaving
the
superintendent's
office
rejoined
his
companion
and
both
of
them
manifested
extreme
impatience
to
be
off
having
paid
the
money
asked
which
amounted
to
fifty
pounds
five
shillings
at
the
usual
special
rate
of
five
shillings
a
mile
they
demanded
to
be
shown
the
carriage
and
at
once
took
their
seats
in
it
although
they
were
assured
that
the
better
part
of
an
hour
must
elapse
before
the
line
could
be
cleared
in
the
meantime
a
singular
coincidence
had
occurred
in
the
office
which
monsieur
caratal
had
just
quitted
a
request
for
a
special
is
not
a
very
uncommon
circumstance
in
a
rich
commercial
centre
but
that
two
should
be
required
upon
the
same
afternoon
was
most
unusual
it
so
happened
however
that
mr
bland
had
hardly
dismissed
the
first
traveller
before
a
second
entered
with
a
similar
request
this
was
a
mr
horace
moore
a
gentlemanly
man
of
military
appearance
who
alleged
that
the
sudden
serious
illness
of
his
wife
in
london
made
it
absolutely
imperative
that
he
should
not
lose
an
instant
in
starting
upon
the
journey
his
distress
and
anxiety
were
so
evident
that
mr
bland
did
all
that
was
possible
to
meet
his
wishes
a
second
special
was
out
of
the
question
as
the
ordinary
local
service
was
already
somewhat
deranged
by
the
first
there
was
the
alternative
however
that
mr
moore
should
share
the
expense
of
monsieur
caratal's
train
and
should
travel
in
the
other
empty
first-class
compartment
if
monsieur
caratal
objected
to
having
him
in
the
one
which
he
occupied
it
was
difficult
to
see
any
objection
to
such
an
arrangement
and
yet
monsieur
caratal
upon
the
suggestion
being
made
to
him
by
mr
potter
hood
absolutely
refused
to
consider
it
for
an
instant
the
train
was
his
he
said
and
he
would
insist
upon
the
exclusive
use
of
it
all
argument
failed
to
overcome
his
ungracious
objections
and
finally
the
plan
had
to
be
abandoned
mr
horace
moore
left
the
station
in
great
distress
after
learning
that
his
only
course
was
to
take
the
ordinary
slow
train
which
leaves
liverpool
at
six
o'clock
at
four
thirty-one
exactly
by
the
station
clock
the
special
train
containing
the
crippled
monsieur
caratal
and
his
gigantic
companion
steamed
out
of
the
liverpool
station
the
line
was
at
that
time
clear
and
there
should
have
been
no
stoppage
before
manchester
the
trains
of
the
london
and
west
coast
railway
run
over
the
lines
of
another
company
as
far
as
this
town
which
should
have
been
reached
by
the
special
rather
before
six
o'clock
at
a
quarter
after
six
considerable
surprise
and
some
consternation
were
caused
amongst
the
officials
at
liverpool
by
the
receipt
of
a
telegram
from
manchester
to
say
that
it
had
not
yet
arrived
an
inquiry
directed
to
st
helens
which
is
a
third
of
the
way
between
the
two
cities
elicited
the
following
reply--
to
james
bland
superintendent
central
l

w
c
liverpool--special
passed
here
at
452
well
up
to
time--dowster
st
helens
this
telegram
was
received
at
six-forty
at
six-fifty
a
second
message
was
received
from
manchester--
no
sign
of
special
as
advised
by
you
and
then
ten
minutes
later
a
third
more
bewildering--
presume
some
mistake
as
to
proposed
running
of
special
local
train
from
st
helens
timed
to
follow
it
has
just
arrived
and
has
seen
nothing
of
it
kindly
wire
advices--manchester
the
matter
was
assuming
a
most
amazing
aspect
although
in
some
respects
the
last
telegram
was
a
relief
to
the
authorities
at
liverpool
if
an
accident
had
occurred
to
the
special
it
seemed
hardly
possible
that
the
local
train
could
have
passed
down
the
same
line
without
observing
it
and
yet
what
was
the
alternative
where
could
the
train
be
had
it
possibly
been
sidetracked
for
some
reason
in
order
to
allow
the
slower
train
to
go
past
such
an
explanation
was
possible
if
some
small
repair
had
to
be
effected
a
telegram
was
dispatched
to
each
of
the
stations
between
st
helens
and
manchester
and
the
superintendent
and
traffic
manager
waited
in
the
utmost
suspense
at
the
instrument
for
the
series
of
replies
which
would
enable
them
to
say
for
certain
what
had
become
of
the
missing
train
the
answers
came
back
in
the
order
of
questions
which
was
the
order
of
the
stations
beginning
at
the
st
helens
end--
special
passed
here
five
o'clock--collins
green
special
passed
here
six
past
five--earlstown
special
passed
here
510--newton
special
passed
here
520--kenyon
junction
no
special
train
has
passed
here--barton
moss
the
two
officials
stared
at
each
other
in
amazement
this
is
unique
in
my
thirty
years
of
experience
said
mr
bland
absolutely
unprecedented
and
inexplicable
sir
the
special
has
gone
wrong
between
kenyon
junction
and
barton
moss
and
yet
there
is
no
siding
so
far
as
my
memory
serves
me
between
the
two
stations
the
special
must
have
run
off
the
metals
but
how
could
the
four-fifty
parliamentary
pass
over
the
same
line
without
observing
it
there's
no
alternative
mr
hood
it
must
be
so
possibly
the
local
train
may
have
observed
something
which
may
throw
some
light
upon
the
matter
we
will
wire
to
manchester
for
more
information
and
to
kenyon
junction
with
instructions
that
the
line
be
examined
instantly
as
far
as
barton
moss
the
answer
from
manchester
came
within
a
few
minutes
no
news
of
missing
special
driver
and
guard
of
slow
train
positive
no
accident
between
kenyon
junction
and
barton
moss
line
quite
clear
and
no
sign
of
anything
unusual--manchester
that
driver
and
guard
will
have
to
go
said
mr
bland
grimly
there
has
been
a
wreck
and
they
have
missed
it
the
special
has
obviously
run
off
the
metals
without
disturbing
the
line--how
it
could
have
done
so
passes
my
comprehension--but
so
it
must
be
and
we
shall
have
a
wire
from
kenyon
or
barton
moss
presently
to
say
that
they
have
found
her
at
the
bottom
of
an
embankment
but
mr
bland's
prophecy
was
not
destined
to
be
fulfilled
half
an
hour
passed
and
then
there
arrived
the
following
message
from
the
station-master
of
kenyon
junction--
there
are
no
traces
of
the
missing
special
it
is
quite
certain
that
she
passed
here
and
that
she
did
not
arrive
at
barton
moss
we
have
detached
engine
from
goods
train
and
i
have
myself
ridden
down
the
line
but
all
is
clear
and
there
is
no
sign
of
any
accident
mr
bland
tore
his
hair
in
his
perplexity
this
is
rank
lunacy
hood
he
cried
does
a
train
vanish
into
thin
air
in
england
in
broad
daylight
the
thing
is
preposterous
an
engine
a
tender
two
carriages
a
van
five
human
beings--and
all
lost
on
a
straight
line
of
railway
unless
we
get
something
positive
within
the
next
hour
i'll
take
inspector
collins
and
go
down
myself
and
then
at
last
something
positive
did
occur
it
took
the
shape
of
another
telegram
from
kenyon
junction
regret
to
report
that
the
dead
body
of
john
slater
driver
of
the
special
train
has
just
been
found
among
the
gorse
bushes
at
a
point
two
and
a
quarter
miles
from
the
junction
had
fallen
from
his
engine
pitched
down
the
embankment
and
rolled
among
the
bushes
injuries
to
his
head
from
the
fall
appear
to
be
cause
of
death
ground
has
now
been
carefully
examined
and
there
is
no
trace
of
the
missing
train
the
country
was
as
has
already
been
stated
in
the
throes
of
a
political
crisis
and
the
attention
of
the
public
was
further
distracted
by
the
important
and
sensational
developments
in
paris
where
a
huge
scandal
threatened
to
destroy
the
government
and
to
wreck
the
reputations
of
many
of
the
leading
men
in
france
the
papers
were
full
of
these
events
and
the
singular
disappearance
of
the
special
train
attracted
less
attention
than
would
have
been
the
case
in
more
peaceful
times
the
grotesque
nature
of
the
event
helped
to
detract
from
its
importance
for
the
papers
were
disinclined
to
believe
the
facts
as
reported
to
them
more
than
one
of
the
london
journals
treated
the
matter
as
an
ingenious
hoax
until
the
coroner's
inquest
upon
the
unfortunate
driver
an
inquest
which
elicited
nothing
of
importance
convinced
them
of
the
tragedy
of
the
incident
mr
bland
accompanied
by
inspector
collins
the
senior
detective
officer
in
the
service
of
the
company
went
down
to
kenyon
junction
the
same
evening
and
their
research
lasted
throughout
the
following
day
but
was
attended
with
purely
negative
results
not
only
was
no
trace
found
of
the
missing
train
but
no
conjecture
could
be
put
forward
which
could
possibly
explain
the
facts
at
the
same
time
inspector
collins's
official
report
which
lies
before
me
as
i
write
served
to
show
that
the
possibilities
were
more
numerous
than
might
have
been
expected
in
the
stretch
of
railway
between
these
two
points
said
he
the
country
is
dotted
with
ironworks
and
collieries
of
these
some
are
being
worked
and
some
have
been
abandoned
there
are
no
fewer
than
twelve
which
have
small-gauge
lines
which
run
trolly-cars
down
to
the
main
line
these
can
of
course
be
disregarded
besides
these
however
there
are
seven
which
have
or
have
had
proper
lines
running
down
and
connecting
with
points
to
the
main
line
so
as
to
convey
their
produce
from
the
mouth
of
the
mine
to
the
great
centres
of
distribution
in
every
case
these
lines
are
only
a
few
miles
in
length
out
of
the
seven
four
belong
to
collieries
which
are
worked
out
or
at
least
to
shafts
which
are
no
longer
used
these
are
the
redgauntlet
hero
slough
of
despond
and
heartsease
mines
the
latter
having
ten
years
ago
been
one
of
the
principal
mines
in
lancashire
these
four
side
lines
may
be
eliminated
from
our
inquiry
for
to
prevent
possible
accidents
the
rails
nearest
to
the
main
line
have
been
taken
up
and
there
is
no
longer
any
connection
there
remain
three
other
side
lines
leading--
a
to
the
carnstock
iron
works
b
to
the
big
ben
colliery
c
to
the
perseverance
colliery
of
these
the
big
ben
line
is
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
and
ends
at
a
dead
wall
of
coal
waiting
removal
from
the
mouth
of
the
mine
nothing
had
been
seen
or
heard
there
of
any
special
the
carnstock
iron
works
line
was
blocked
all
day
upon
the
3rd
of
june
by
sixteen
truckloads
of
hematite
it
is
a
single
line
and
nothing
could
have
passed
as
to
the
perseverance
line
it
is
a
large
double
line
which
does
a
considerable
traffic
for
the
output
of
the
mine
is
very
large
on
the
3rd
of
june
this
traffic
proceeded
as
usual
hundreds
of
men
including
a
gang
of
railway
platelayers
were
working
along
the
two
miles
and
a
quarter
which
constitute
the
total
length
of
the
line
and
it
is
inconceivable
that
an
unexpected
train
could
have
come
down
there
without
attracting
universal
attention
it
may
be
remarked
in
conclusion
that
this
branch
line
is
nearer
to
st
helens
than
the
point
at
which
the
engine-driver
was
discovered
so
that
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
train
was
past
that
point
before
misfortune
overtook
her
as
to
john
slater
there
is
no
clue
to
be
gathered
from
his
appearance
or
injuries
we
can
only
say
that
so
far
as
we
can
see
he
met
his
end
by
falling
off
his
engine
though
why
he
fell
or
what
became
of
the
engine
after
his
fall
is
a
question
upon
which
i
do
not
feel
qualified
to
offer
an
opinion
in
conclusion
the
inspector
offered
his
resignation
to
the
board
being
much
nettled
by
an
accusation
of
incompetence
in
the
london
papers
a
month
elapsed
during
which
both
the
police
and
the
company
prosecuted
their
inquiries
without
the
slightest
success
a
reward
was
offered
and
a
pardon
promised
in
case
of
crime
but
they
were
both
unclaimed
every
day
the
public
opened
their
papers
with
the
conviction
that
so
grotesque
a
mystery
would
at
last
be
solved
but
week
after
week
passed
by
and
a
solution
remained
as
far
off
as
ever
in
broad
daylight
upon
a
june
afternoon
in
the
most
thickly
inhabited
portion
of
england
a
train
with
its
occupants
had
disappeared
as
completely
as
if
some
master
of
subtle
chemistry
had
volatilized
it
into
gas
indeed
among
the
various
conjectures
which
were
put
forward
in
the
public
press
there
were
some
which
seriously
asserted
that
supernatural
or
at
least
preternatural
agencies
had
been
at
work
and
that
the
deformed
monsieur
caratal
was
probably
a
person
who
was
better
known
under
a
less
polite
name
others
fixed
upon
his
swarthy
companion
as
being
the
author
of
the
mischief
but
what
it
was
exactly
which
he
had
done
could
never
be
clearly
formulated
in
words
amongst
the
many
suggestions
put
forward
by
various
newspapers
or
private
individuals
there
were
one
or
two
which
were
feasible
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
public
one
which
appeared
in
the
times
over
the
signature
of
an
amateur
reasoner
of
some
celebrity
at
that
date
attempted
to
deal
with
the
matter
in
a
critical
and
semi-scientific
manner
an
extract
must
suffice
although
the
curious
can
see
the
whole
letter
in
the
issue
of
the
3rd
of
july
it
is
one
of
the
elementary
principles
of
practical
reasoning
he
remarked
that
when
the
impossible
has
been
eliminated
the
residuum
however
improbable
must
contain
the
truth
it
is
certain
that
the
train
left
kenyon
junction
it
is
certain
that
it
did
not
reach
barton
moss
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
unlikely
but
still
possible
that
it
may
have
taken
one
of
the
seven
available
side
lines
it
is
obviously
impossible
for
a
train
to
run
where
there
are
no
rails
and
therefore
we
may
reduce
our
improbables
to
the
three
open
lines
namely
the
carnstock
iron
works
the
big
ben
and
the
perseverance
is
there
a
secret
society
of
colliers
an
english
camorra
which
is
capable
of
destroying
both
train
and
passengers
it
is
improbable
but
it
is
not
impossible
i
confess
that
i
am
unable
to
suggest
any
other
solution
i
should
certainly
advise
the
company
to
direct
all
their
energies
towards
the
observation
of
those
three
lines
and
of
the
workmen
at
the
end
of
them
a
careful
supervision
of
the
pawnbrokers'
shops
of
the
district
might
possibly
bring
some
suggestive
facts
to
light
the
suggestion
coming
from
a
recognized
authority
upon
such
matters
created
considerable
interest
and
a
fierce
opposition
from
those
who
considered
such
a
statement
to
be
a
preposterous
libel
upon
an
honest
and
deserving
set
of
men
the
only
answer
to
this
criticism
was
a
challenge
to
the
objectors
to
lay
any
more
feasible
explanations
before
the
public
in
reply
to
this
two
others
were
forthcoming
times
july
7th
and
9th
the
first
suggested
that
the
train
might
have
run
off
the
metals
and
be
lying
submerged
in
the
lancashire
and
staffordshire
canal
which
runs
parallel
to
the
railway
for
some
hundred
of
yards
this
suggestion
was
thrown
out
of
court
by
the
published
depth
of
the
canal
which
was
entirely
insufficient
to
conceal
so
large
an
object
the
second
correspondent
wrote
calling
attention
to
the
bag
which
appeared
to
be
the
sole
luggage
which
the
travellers
had
brought
with
them
and
suggesting
that
some
novel
explosive
of
immense
and
pulverizing
power
might
have
been
concealed
in
it
the
obvious
absurdity
however
of
supposing
that
the
whole
train
might
be
blown
to
dust
while
the
metals
remained
uninjured
reduced
any
such
explanation
to
a
farce
the
investigation
had
drifted
into
this
hopeless
position
when
a
new
and
most
unexpected
incident
occurred
this
was
nothing
less
than
the
receipt
by
mrs
mcpherson
of
a
letter
from
her
husband
james
mcpherson
who
had
been
the
guard
on
the
missing
train
the
letter
which
was
dated
july
5th
1890
was
posted
from
new
york
and
came
to
hand
upon
july
14th
some
doubts
were
expressed
as
to
its
genuine
character
but
mrs
mcpherson
was
positive
as
to
the
writing
and
the
fact
that
it
contained
a
remittance
of
a
hundred
dollars
in
five-dollar
notes
was
enough
in
itself
to
discount
the
idea
of
a
hoax
no
address
was
given
in
the
letter
which
ran
in
this
way
my
dear
wife--
i
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal
and
i
find
it
very
hard
to
give
you
up
the
same
with
lizzie
i
try
to
fight
against
it
but
it
will
always
come
back
to
me
i
send
you
some
money
which
will
change
into
twenty
english
pounds
this
should
be
enough
to
bring
both
lizzie
and
you
across
the
atlantic
and
you
will
find
the
hamburg
boats
which
stop
at
southampton
very
good
boats
and
cheaper
than
liverpool
if
you
could
come
here
and
stop
at
the
johnston
house
i
would
try
and
send
you
word
how
to
meet
but
things
are
very
difficult
with
me
at
present
and
i
am
not
very
happy
finding
it
hard
to
give
you
both
up
so
no
more
at
present
from
your
loving
husband
james
mcpherson
for
a
time
it
was
confidently
anticipated
that
this
letter
would
lead
to
the
clearing
up
of
the
whole
matter
the
more
so
as
it
was
ascertained
that
a
passenger
who
bore
a
close
resemblance
to
the
missing
guard
had
travelled
from
southampton
under
the
name
of
summers
in
the
hamburg
and
new
york
liner
vistula
which
started
upon
the
7th
of
june
mrs
mcpherson
and
her
sister
lizzie
dolton
went
across
to
new
york
as
directed
and
stayed
for
three
weeks
at
the
johnston
house
without
hearing
anything
from
the
missing
man
it
is
probable
that
some
injudicious
comments
in
the
press
may
have
warned
him
that
the
police
were
using
them
as
a
bait
however
this
may
be
it
is
certain
that
he
neither
wrote
nor
came
and
the
women
were
eventually
compelled
to
return
to
liverpool
and
so
the
matter
stood
and
has
continued
to
stand
up
to
the
present
year
of
1898
incredible
as
it
may
seem
nothing
has
transpired
during
these
eight
years
which
has
shed
the
least
light
upon
the
extraordinary
disappearance
of
the
special
train
which
contained
monsieur
caratal
and
his
companion
careful
inquiries
into
the
antecedents
of
the
two
travellers
have
only
established
the
fact
that
monsieur
caratal
was
well
known
as
a
financier
and
political
agent
in
central
america
and
that
during
his
voyage
to
europe
he
had
betrayed
extraordinary
anxiety
to
reach
paris
his
companion
whose
name
was
entered
upon
the
passenger
lists
as
eduardo
gomez
was
a
man
whose
record
was
a
violent
one
and
whose
reputation
was
that
of
a
bravo
and
a
bully
there
was
evidence
to
show
however
that
he
was
honestly
devoted
to
the
interests
of
monsieur
caratal
and
that
the
latter
being
a
man
of
puny
physique
employed
the
other
as
a
guard
and
protector
it
may
be
added
that
no
information
came
from
paris
as
to
what
the
objects
of
monsieur
caratal's
hurried
journey
may
have
been
this
comprises
all
the
facts
of
the
case
up
to
the
publication
in
the
marseilles
papers
of
the
recent
confession
of
herbert
de
lernac
now
under
sentence
of
death
for
the
murder
of
a
merchant
named
bonvalot
this
statement
may
be
literally
translated
as
follows
it
is
not
out
of
mere
pride
or
boasting
that
i
give
this
information
for
if
that
were
my
object
i
could
tell
a
dozen
actions
of
mine
which
are
quite
as
splendid
but
i
do
it
in
order
that
certain
gentlemen
in
paris
may
understand
that
i
who
am
able
here
to
tell
about
the
fate
of
monsieur
caratal
can
also
tell
in
whose
interest
and
at
whose
request
the
deed
was
done
unless
the
reprieve
which
i
am
awaiting
comes
to
me
very
quickly
take
warning
messieurs
before
it
is
too
late
you
know
herbert
de
lernac
and
you
are
aware
that
his
deeds
are
as
ready
as
his
words
hasten
then
or
you
are
lost
at
present
i
shall
mention
no
names--if
you
only
heard
the
names
what
would
you
not
think--but
i
shall
merely
tell
you
how
cleverly
i
did
it
i
was
true
to
my
employers
then
and
no
doubt
they
will
be
true
to
me
now
i
hope
so
and
until
i
am
convinced
that
they
have
betrayed
me
these
names
which
would
convulse
europe
shall
not
be
divulged
but
on
that
day

well
i
say
no
more
in
a
word
then
there
was
a
famous
trial
in
paris
in
the
year
1890
in
connection
with
a
monstrous
scandal
in
politics
and
finance
how
monstrous
that
scandal
was
can
never
be
known
save
by
such
confidential
agents
as
myself
the
honour
and
careers
of
many
of
the
chief
men
in
france
were
at
stake
you
have
seen
a
group
of
ninepins
standing
all
so
rigid
and
prim
and
unbending
then
there
comes
the
ball
from
far
away
and
pop
pop
pop--there
are
your
ninepins
on
the
floor
well
imagine
some
of
the
greatest
men
in
france
as
these
ninepins
and
then
this
monsieur
caratal
was
the
ball
which
could
be
seen
coming
from
far
away
if
he
arrived
then
it
was
pop
pop
pop
for
all
of
them
it
was
determined
that
he
should
not
arrive
i
do
not
accuse
them
all
of
being
conscious
of
what
was
to
happen
there
were
as
i
have
said
great
financial
as
well
as
political
interests
at
stake
and
a
syndicate
was
formed
to
manage
the
business
some
subscribed
to
the
syndicate
who
hardly
understood
what
were
its
objects
but
others
understood
very
well
and
they
can
rely
upon
it
that
i
have
not
forgotten
their
names
they
had
ample
warning
that
monsieur
caratal
was
coming
long
before
he
left
south
america
and
they
knew
that
the
evidence
which
he
held
would
certainly
mean
ruin
to
all
of
them
the
syndicate
had
the
command
of
an
unlimited
amount
of
money--absolutely
unlimited
you
understand
they
looked
round
for
an
agent
who
was
capable
of
wielding
this
gigantic
power
the
man
chosen
must
be
inventive
resolute
adaptive--a
man
in
a
million
they
chose
herbert
de
lernac
and
i
admit
that
they
were
right
my
duties
were
to
choose
my
subordinates
to
use
freely
the
power
which
money
gives
and
to
make
certain
that
monsieur
caratal
should
never
arrive
in
paris
with
characteristic
energy
i
set
about
my
commission
within
an
hour
of
receiving
my
instructions
and
the
steps
which
i
took
were
the
very
best
for
the
purpose
which
could
possibly
be
devised
a
man
whom
i
could
trust
was
dispatched
instantly
to
south
america
to
travel
home
with
monsieur
caratal
had
he
arrived
in
time
the
ship
would
never
have
reached
liverpool
but
alas
it
had
already
started
before
my
agent
could
reach
it
i
fitted
out
a
small
armed
brig
to
intercept
it
but
again
i
was
unfortunate
like
all
great
organizers
i
was
however
prepared
for
failure
and
had
a
series
of
alternatives
prepared
one
or
the
other
of
which
must
succeed
you
must
not
underrate
the
difficulties
of
my
undertaking
or
imagine
that
a
mere
commonplace
assassination
would
meet
the
case
we
must
destroy
not
only
monsieur
caratal
but
monsieur
caratal's
documents
and
monsieur
caratal's
companions
also
if
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
communicated
his
secrets
to
them
and
you
must
remember
that
they
were
on
the
alert
and
keenly
suspicious
of
any
such
attempt
it
was
a
task
which
was
in
every
way
worthy
of
me
for
i
am
always
most
masterful
where
another
would
be
appalled
i
was
all
ready
for
monsieur
caratal's
reception
in
liverpool
and
i
was
the
more
eager
because
i
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
made
arrangements
by
which
he
would
have
a
considerable
guard
from
the
moment
that
he
arrived
in
london
anything
which
was
to
be
done
must
be
done
between
the
moment
of
his
setting
foot
upon
the
liverpool
quay
and
that
of
his
arrival
at
the
london
and
west
coast
terminus
in
london
we
prepared
six
plans
each
more
elaborate
than
the
last
which
plan
would
be
used
would
depend
upon
his
own
movements
do
what
he
would
we
were
ready
for
him
if
he
had
stayed
in
liverpool
we
were
ready
if
he
took
an
ordinary
train
an
express
or
a
special
all
was
ready
everything
had
been
foreseen
and
provided
for
you
may
imagine
that
i
could
not
do
all
this
myself
what
could
i
know
of
the
english
railway
lines
but
money
can
procure
willing
agents
all
the
world
over
and
i
soon
had
one
of
the
acutest
brains
in
england
to
assist
me
i
will
mention
no
names
but
it
would
be
unjust
to
claim
all
the
credit
for
myself
my
english
ally
was
worthy
of
such
an
alliance
he
knew
the
london
and
west
coast
line
thoroughly
and
he
had
the
command
of
a
band
of
workers
who
were
trustworthy
and
intelligent
the
idea
was
his
and
my
own
judgement
was
only
required
in
the
details
we
bought
over
several
officials
amongst
whom
the
most
important
was
james
mcpherson
whom
we
had
ascertained
to
be
the
guard
most
likely
to
be
employed
upon
a
special
train
smith
the
stoker
was
also
in
our
employ
john
slater
the
engine-driver
had
been
approached
but
had
been
found
to
be
obstinate
and
dangerous
so
we
desisted
we
had
no
certainty
that
monsieur
caratal
would
take
a
special
but
we
thought
it
very
probable
for
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
to
him
that
he
should
reach
paris
without
delay
it
was
for
this
contingency
therefore
that
we
made
special
preparations--preparations
which
were
complete
down
to
the
last
detail
long
before
his
steamer
had
sighted
the
shores
of
england
you
will
be
amused
to
learn
that
there
was
one
of
my
agents
in
the
pilot-boat
which
brought
that
steamer
to
its
moorings
the
moment
that
caratal
arrived
in
liverpool
we
knew
that
he
suspected
danger
and
was
on
his
guard
he
had
brought
with
him
as
an
escort
a
dangerous
fellow
named
gomez
a
man
who
carried
weapons
and
was
prepared
to
use
them
this
fellow
carried
caratal's
confidential
papers
for
him
and
was
ready
to
protect
either
them
or
his
master
the
probability
was
that
caratal
had
taken
him
into
his
counsel
and
that
to
remove
caratal
without
removing
gomez
would
be
a
mere
waste
of
energy
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
be
involved
in
a
common
fate
and
our
plans
to
that
end
were
much
facilitated
by
their
request
for
a
special
train
on
that
special
train
you
will
understand
that
two
out
of
the
three
servants
of
the
company
were
really
in
our
employ
at
a
price
which
would
make
them
independent
for
a
lifetime
i
do
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
english
are
more
honest
than
any
other
nation
but
i
have
found
them
more
expensive
to
buy
i
have
already
spoken
of
my
english
agent--who
is
a
man
with
a
considerable
future
before
him
unless
some
complaint
of
the
throat
carries
him
off
before
his
time
he
had
charge
of
all
arrangements
at
liverpool
whilst
i
was
stationed
at
the
inn
at
kenyon
where
i
awaited
a
cipher
signal
to
act
when
the
special
was
arranged
for
my
agent
instantly
telegraphed
to
me
and
warned
me
how
soon
i
should
have
everything
ready
he
himself
under
the
name
of
horace
moore
applied
immediately
for
a
special
also
in
the
hope
that
he
would
be
sent
down
with
monsieur
caratal
which
might
under
certain
circumstances
have
been
helpful
to
us
if
for
example
our
great
coup
had
failed
it
would
then
have
become
the
duty
of
my
agent
to
have
shot
them
both
and
destroyed
their
papers
caratal
was
on
his
guard
however
and
refused
to
admit
any
other
traveller
my
agent
then
left
the
station
returned
by
another
entrance
entered
the
guard's
van
on
the
side
farthest
from
the
platform
and
travelled
down
with
mcpherson
the
guard
in
the
meantime
you
will
be
interested
to
know
what
my
movements
were
everything
had
been
prepared
for
days
before
and
only
the
finishing
touches
were
needed
the
side
line
which
we
had
chosen
had
once
joined
the
main
line
but
it
had
been
disconnected
we
had
only
to
replace
a
few
rails
to
connect
it
once
more
these
rails
had
been
laid
down
as
far
as
could
be
done
without
danger
of
attracting
attention
and
now
it
was
merely
a
case
of
completing
a
juncture
with
the
line
and
arranging
the
points
as
they
had
been
before
the
sleepers
had
never
been
removed
and
the
rails
fish-plates
and
rivets
were
all
ready
for
we
had
taken
them
from
a
siding
on
the
abandoned
portion
of
the
line
with
my
small
but
competent
band
of
workers
we
had
everything
ready
long
before
the
special
arrived
when
it
did
arrive
it
ran
off
upon
the
small
side
line
so
easily
that
the
jolting
of
the
points
appears
to
have
been
entirely
unnoticed
by
the
two
travellers
our
plan
had
been
that
smith
the
stoker
should
chloroform
john
slater
the
driver
so
that
he
should
vanish
with
the
others
in
this
respect
and
in
this
respect
only
our
plans
miscarried--i
except
the
criminal
folly
of
mcpherson
in
writing
home
to
his
wife
our
stoker
did
his
business
so
clumsily
that
slater
in
his
struggles
fell
off
the
engine
and
though
fortune
was
with
us
so
far
that
he
broke
his
neck
in
the
fall
still
he
remained
as
a
blot
upon
that
which
would
otherwise
have
been
one
of
those
complete
masterpieces
which
are
only
to
be
contemplated
in
silent
admiration
the
criminal
expert
will
find
in
john
slater
the
one
flaw
in
all
our
admirable
combinations
a
man
who
has
had
as
many
triumphs
as
i
can
afford
to
be
frank
and
i
therefore
lay
my
finger
upon
john
slater
and
i
proclaim
him
to
be
a
flaw
but
now
i
have
got
our
special
train
upon
the
small
line
two
kilometres
or
rather
more
than
one
mile
in
length
which
leads
or
rather
used
to
lead
to
the
abandoned
heartsease
mine
once
one
of
the
largest
coal
mines
in
england
you
will
ask
how
it
is
that
no
one
saw
the
train
upon
this
unused
line
i
answer
that
along
its
entire
length
it
runs
through
a
deep
cutting
and
that
unless
someone
had
been
on
the
edge
of
that
cutting
he
could
not
have
seen
it
there
was
someone
on
the
edge
of
that
cutting
i
was
there
and
now
i
will
tell
you
what
i
saw
my
assistant
had
remained
at
the
points
in
order
that
he
might
superintend
the
switching
off
of
the
train
he
had
four
armed
men
with
him
so
that
if
the
train
ran
off
the
line--we
thought
it
probable
because
the
points
were
very
rusty--we
might
still
have
resources
to
fall
back
upon
having
once
seen
it
safely
on
the
side
line
he
handed
over
the
responsibility
to
me
i
was
waiting
at
a
point
which
overlooks
the
mouth
of
the
mine
and
i
was
also
armed
as
were
my
two
companions
come
what
might
you
see
i
was
always
ready
the
moment
that
the
train
was
fairly
on
the
side
line
smith
the
stoker
slowed-down
the
engine
and
then
having
turned
it
on
to
the
fullest
speed
again
he
and
mcpherson
with
my
english
lieutenant
sprang
off
before
it
was
too
late
it
may
be
that
it
was
this
slowing-down
which
first
attracted
the
attention
of
the
travellers
but
the
train
was
running
at
full
speed
again
before
their
heads
appeared
at
the
open
window
it
makes
me
smile
to
think
how
bewildered
they
must
have
been
picture
to
yourself
your
own
feelings
if
on
looking
out
of
your
luxurious
carriage
you
suddenly
perceived
that
the
lines
upon
which
you
ran
were
rusted
and
corroded
red
and
yellow
with
disuse
and
decay
what
a
catch
must
have
come
in
their
breath
as
in
a
second
it
flashed
upon
them
that
it
was
not
manchester
but
death
which
was
waiting
for
them
at
the
end
of
that
sinister
line
but
the
train
was
running
with
frantic
speed
rolling
and
rocking
over
the
rotten
line
while
the
wheels
made
a
frightful
screaming
sound
upon
the
rusted
surface
i
was
close
to
them
and
could
see
their
faces
caratal
was
praying
i
think--there
was
something
like
a
rosary
dangling
out
of
his
hand
the
other
roared
like
a
bull
who
smells
the
blood
of
the
slaughter-house
he
saw
us
standing
on
the
bank
and
he
beckoned
to
us
like
a
madman
then
he
tore
at
his
wrist
and
threw
his
dispatch-box
out
of
the
window
in
our
direction
of
course
his
meaning
was
obvious
here
was
the
evidence
and
they
would
promise
to
be
silent
if
their
lives
were
spared
it
would
have
been
very
agreeable
if
we
could
have
done
so
but
business
is
business
besides
the
train
was
now
as
much
beyond
our
controls
as
theirs
he
ceased
howling
when
the
train
rattled
round
the
curve
and
they
saw
the
black
mouth
of
the
mine
yawning
before
them
we
had
removed
the
boards
which
had
covered
it
and
we
had
cleared
the
square
entrance
the
rails
had
formerly
run
very
close
to
the
shaft
for
the
convenience
of
loading
the
coal
and
we
had
only
to
add
two
or
three
lengths
of
rail
in
order
to
lead
to
the
very
brink
of
the
shaft
in
fact
as
the
lengths
would
not
quite
fit
our
line
projected
about
three
feet
over
the
edge
we
saw
the
two
heads
at
the
window
caratal
below
gomez
above
but
they
had
both
been
struck
silent
by
what
they
saw
and
yet
they
could
not
withdraw
their
heads
the
sight
seemed
to
have
paralysed
them
i
had
wondered
how
the
train
running
at
a
great
speed
would
take
the
pit
into
which
i
had
guided
it
and
i
was
much
interested
in
watching
it
one
of
my
colleagues
thought
that
it
would
actually
jump
it
and
indeed
it
was
not
very
far
from
doing
so
fortunately
however
it
fell
short
and
the
buffers
of
the
engine
struck
the
other
lip
of
the
shaft
with
a
tremendous
crash
the
funnel
flew
off
into
the
air
the
tender
carriages
and
van
were
all
smashed
up
into
one
jumble
which
with
the
remains
of
the
engine
choked
for
a
minute
or
so
the
mouth
of
the
pit
then
something
gave
way
in
the
middle
and
the
whole
mass
of
green
iron
smoking
coals
brass
fittings
wheels
wood-work
and
cushions
all
crumbled
together
and
crashed
down
into
the
mine
we
heard
the
rattle
rattle
rattle
as
the
debris
struck
against
the
walls
and
then
quite
a
long
time
afterwards
there
came
a
deep
roar
as
the
remains
of
the
train
struck
the
bottom
the
boiler
may
have
burst
for
a
sharp
crash
came
after
the
roar
and
then
a
dense
cloud
of
steam
and
smoke
swirled
up
out
of
the
black
depths
falling
in
a
spray
as
thick
as
rain
all
round
us
then
the
vapour
shredded
off
into
thin
wisps
which
floated
away
in
the
summer
sunshine
and
all
was
quiet
again
in
the
heartsease
mine
and
now
having
carried
out
our
plans
so
successfully
it
only
remained
to
leave
no
trace
behind
us
our
little
band
of
workers
at
the
other
end
had
already
ripped
up
the
rails
and
disconnected
the
side
line
replacing
everything
as
it
had
been
before
we
were
equally
busy
at
the
mine
the
funnel
and
other
fragments
were
thrown
in
the
shaft
was
planked
over
as
it
used
to
be
and
the
lines
which
led
to
it
were
torn
up
and
taken
away
then
without
flurry
but
without
delay
we
all
made
our
way
out
of
the
country
most
of
us
to
paris
my
english
colleague
to
manchester
and
mcpherson
to
southampton
whence
he
emigrated
to
america
let
the
english
papers
of
that
date
tell
how
throughly
we
had
done
our
work
and
how
completely
we
had
thrown
the
cleverest
of
their
detectives
off
our
track
you
will
remember
that
gomez
threw
his
bag
of
papers
out
of
the
window
and
i
need
not
say
that
i
secured
that
bag
and
brought
them
to
my
employers
it
may
interest
my
employers
now
however
to
learn
that
out
of
that
bag
i
took
one
or
two
little
papers
as
a
souvenir
of
the
occasion
i
have
no
wish
to
publish
these
papers
but
still
it
is
every
man
for
himself
in
this
world
and
what
else
can
i
do
if
my
friends
will
not
come
to
my
aid
when
i
want
them
messieurs
you
may
believe
that
herbert
de
lernac
is
quite
as
formidable
when
he
is
against
you
as
when
he
is
with
you
and
that
he
is
not
a
man
to
go
to
the
guillotine
until
he
has
seen
that
every
one
of
you
is
en
route
for
new
caledonia
for
your
own
sake
if
not
for
mine
make
haste
monsieur
de
----
and
general
----
and
baron
----
you
can
fill
up
the
blanks
for
yourselves
as
you
read
this
i
promise
you
that
in
the
next
edition
there
will
be
no
blanks
to
fill
ps--as
i
look
over
my
statement
there
is
only
one
omission
which
i
can
see
it
concerns
the
unfortunate
man
mcpherson
who
was
foolish
enough
to
write
to
his
wife
and
to
make
an
appointment
with
her
in
new
york
it
can
be
imagined
that
when
interests
like
ours
were
at
stake
we
could
not
leave
them
to
the
chance
of
whether
a
man
in
that
class
of
life
would
or
would
not
give
away
his
secrets
to
a
woman
having
once
broken
his
oath
by
writing
to
his
wife
we
could
not
trust
him
any
more
we
took
steps
therefore
to
insure
that
he
should
not
see
his
wife
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
write
to
her
and
to
assure
her
that
there
is
no
impediment
to
her
marrying
again
the
beetle-hunter
a
curious
experience
said
the
doctor
yes
my
friends
i
have
had
one
very
curious
experience
i
never
expect
to
have
another
for
it
is
against
all
doctrines
of
chances
that
two
such
events
would
befall
any
one
man
in
a
single
lifetime
you
may
believe
me
or
not
but
the
thing
happened
exactly
as
i
tell
it
i
had
just
become
a
medical
man
but
i
had
not
started
in
practice
and
i
lived
in
rooms
in
gower
street
the
street
has
been
renumbered
since
then
but
it
was
in
the
only
house
which
has
a
bow-window
upon
the
left-hand
side
as
you
go
down
from
the
metropolitan
station
a
widow
named
murchison
kept
the
house
at
that
time
and
she
had
three
medical
students
and
one
engineer
as
lodgers
i
occupied
the
top
room
which
was
the
cheapest
but
cheap
as
it
was
it
was
more
than
i
could
afford
my
small
resources
were
dwindling
away
and
every
week
it
became
more
necessary
that
i
should
find
something
to
do
yet
i
was
very
unwilling
to
go
into
general
practice
for
my
tastes
were
all
in
the
direction
of
science
and
especially
of
zoology
towards
which
i
had
always
a
strong
leaning
i
had
almost
given
the
fight
up
and
resigned
myself
to
being
a
medical
drudge
for
life
when
the
turning-point
of
my
struggles
came
in
a
very
extraordinary
way
one
morning
i
had
picked
up
the
standard
and
was
glancing
over
its
contents
there
was
a
complete
absence
of
news
and
i
was
about
to
toss
the
paper
down
again
when
my
eyes
were
caught
by
an
advertisement
at
the
head
of
the
personal
column
it
was
worded
in
this
way
wanted
for
one
or
more
days
the
services
of
a
medical
man
it
is
essential
that
he
should
be
a
man
of
strong
physique
of
steady
nerves
and
of
a
resolute
nature
must
be
an
entomologist--coleopterist
preferred
apply
in
person
at
77b
brook
street
application
must
be
made
before
twelve
o'clock
today
now
i
have
already
said
that
i
was
devoted
to
zoology
of
all
branches
of
zoology
the
study
of
insects
was
the
most
attractive
to
me
and
of
all
insects
beetles
were
the
species
with
which
i
was
most
familiar
butterfly
collectors
are
numerous
but
beetles
are
far
more
varied
and
more
accessible
in
these
islands
than
are
butterflies
it
was
this
fact
which
had
attracted
my
attention
to
them
and
i
had
myself
made
a
collection
which
numbered
some
hundred
varieties
as
to
the
other
requisites
of
the
advertisement
i
knew
that
my
nerves
could
be
depended
upon
and
i
had
won
the
weight-throwing
competition
at
the
inter-hospital
sports
clearly
i
was
the
very
man
for
the
vacancy
within
five
minutes
of
my
having
read
the
advertisement
i
was
in
a
cab
and
on
my
was
to
brook
street
as
i
drove
i
kept
turning
the
matter
over
in
my
head
and
trying
to
make
a
guess
as
to
what
sort
of
employment
it
could
be
which
needed
such
curious
qualifications
a
strong
physique
a
resolute
nature
a
medical
training
and
a
knowledge
of
beetles--what
connection
could
there
be
between
these
various
requisites
and
then
there
was
the
disheartening
fact
that
the
situation
was
not
a
permanent
one
but
terminable
from
day
to
day
according
to
the
terms
of
the
advertisement
the
more
i
pondered
over
it
the
more
unintelligible
did
it
become
but
at
the
end
of
my
meditations
i
always
came
back
to
the
ground
fact
that
come
what
might
i
had
nothing
to
lose
that
i
was
completely
at
the
end
of
my
resources
and
that
i
was
ready
for
any
adventure
however
desperate
which
would
put
a
few
honest
sovereigns
into
my
pocket
the
man
fears
to
fail
who
has
to
pay
for
his
failure
but
there
was
no
penalty
which
fortune
could
exact
from
me
i
was
like
the
gambler
with
empty
pockets
who
is
still
allowed
to
try
his
luck
with
the
others
no
77b
brook
street
was
one
of
those
dingy
and
yet
imposing
houses
dun-coloured
and
flat-faced
with
the
intensely
respectable
and
solid
air
which
marks
the
georgian
builder
as
i
alighted
from
the
cab
a
young
man
came
out
of
the
door
and
walked
swiftly
down
the
street
in
passing
me
i
noticed
that
he
cast
an
inquisitive
and
somewhat
malevolent
glance
at
me
and
i
took
the
incident
as
a
good
omen
for
his
appearance
was
that
of
a
rejected
candidate
and
if
he
resented
my
application
it
meant
that
the
vacancy
was
not
yet
filled
up
full
of
hope
i
ascended
the
broad
steps
and
rapped
with
the
heavy
knocker
a
footman
in
powder
and
livery
opened
the
door
clearly
i
was
in
touch
with
the
people
of
wealth
and
fashion
yes
sir
said
the
footman
i
came
in
answer
to----
quite
so
sir
said
the
footman
lord
linchmere
will
see
you
at
once
in
the
library
lord
linchmere
i
had
vaguely
heard
the
name
but
could
not
for
the
instant
recall
anything
about
him
following
the
footman
i
was
shown
into
a
large
book-lined
room
in
which
there
was
seated
behind
a
writing-desk
a
small
man
with
a
pleasant
clean-shaven
mobile
face
and
long
hair
shot
with
grey
brushed
back
from
his
forehead
he
looked
me
up
and
down
with
a
very
shrewd
penetrating
glance
holding
the
card
which
the
footman
had
given
him
in
his
right
hand
then
he
smiled
pleasantly
and
i
felt
that
externally
at
any
rate
i
possessed
the
qualifications
which
he
desired
you
have
come
in
answer
to
my
advertisement
dr
hamilton
he
asked
yes
sir
do
you
fulfil
the
conditions
which
are
there
laid
down
i
believe
that
i
do
you
are
a
powerful
man
or
so
i
should
judge
from
your
appearance
i
think
that
i
am
fairly
strong
and
resolute
i
believe
so
have
you
ever
known
what
it
was
to
be
exposed
to
imminent
danger
no
i
don't
know
that
i
ever
have
but
you
think
you
would
be
prompt
and
cool
at
such
a
time
i
hope
so
well
i
believe
that
you
would
i
have
the
more
confidence
in
you
because
you
do
not
pretend
to
be
certain
as
to
what
you
would
do
in
a
position
that
was
new
to
you
my
impression
is
that
so
far
as
personal
qualities
go
you
are
the
very
man
of
whom
i
am
in
search
that
being
settled
we
may
pass
on
to
the
next
point
which
is
to
talk
to
me
about
beetles
i
looked
across
to
see
if
he
was
joking
but
on
the
contrary
he
was
leaning
eagerly
forward
across
his
desk
and
there
was
an
expression
of
something
like
anxiety
in
his
eyes
i
am
afraid
that
you
do
not
know
about
beetles
he
cried
on
the
contrary
sir
it
is
the
one
scientific
subject
about
which
i
feel
that
i
really
do
know
something
i
am
overjoyed
to
hear
it
please
talk
to
me
about
beetles
i
talked
i
do
not
profess
to
have
said
anything
original
upon
the
subject
but
i
gave
a
short
sketch
of
the
characteristics
of
the
beetle
and
ran
over
the
more
common
species
with
some
allusions
to
the
specimens
in
my
own
little
collection
and
to
the
article
upon
burying
beetles
which
i
had
contributed
to
the
journal
of
entomological
science
what
not
a
collector
cried
lord
linchmere
you
don't
mean
that
you
are
yourself
a
collector
his
eyes
danced
with
pleasure
at
the
thought
you
are
certainly
the
very
man
in
london
for
my
purpose
i
thought
that
among
five
millions
of
people
there
must
be
such
a
man
but
the
difficulty
is
to
lay
one's
hands
upon
him
i
have
been
extraordinarily
fortunate
in
finding
you
he
rang
a
gong
upon
the
table
and
the
footman
entered
ask
lady
rossiter
to
have
the
goodness
to
step
this
way
said
his
lordship
and
a
few
moments
later
the
lady
was
ushered
into
the
room
she
was
a
small
middle-aged
woman
very
like
lord
linchmere
in
appearance
with
the
same
quick
alert
features
and
grey-black
hair
the
expression
of
anxiety
however
which
i
had
observed
upon
his
face
was
very
much
more
marked
upon
hers
some
great
grief
seemed
to
have
cast
its
shadow
over
her
features
as
lord
linchmere
presented
me
she
turned
her
face
full
upon
me
and
i
was
shocked
to
observe
a
half-healed
scar
extending
for
two
inches
over
her
right
eyebrow
it
was
partly
concealed
by
plaster
but
none
the
less
i
could
see
that
it
had
been
a
serious
wound
and
not
long
inflicted
dr
hamilton
is
the
very
man
for
our
purpose
evelyn
said
lord
linchmere
he
is
actually
a
collector
of
beetles
and
he
has
written
articles
upon
the
subject
really
said
lady
rossiter
then
you
must
have
heard
of
my
husband
everyone
who
knows
anything
about
beetles
must
have
heard
of
sir
thomas
rossiter
for
the
first
time
a
thin
little
ray
of
light
began
to
break
into
the
obscure
business
here
at
last
was
a
connection
between
these
people
and
beetles
sir
thomas
rossiter--he
was
the
greatest
authority
upon
the
subject
in
the
world
he
had
made
it
his
lifelong
study
and
had
written
a
most
exhaustive
work
upon
it
i
hastened
to
assure
her
that
i
had
read
and
appreciated
it
have
you
met
my
husband
she
asked
no
i
have
not
but
you
shall
said
lord
linchmere
with
decision
the
lady
was
standing
beside
the
desk
and
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
it
was
obvious
to
me
as
i
saw
their
faces
together
that
they
were
brother
and
sister
are
you
really
prepared
for
this
charles
it
is
noble
of
you
but
you
fill
me
with
fears
her
voice
quavered
with
apprehension
and
he
appeared
to
me
to
be
equally
moved
though
he
was
making
strong
efforts
to
conceal
his
agitation
yes
yes
dear
it
is
all
settled
it
is
all
decided
in
fact
there
is
no
other
possible
way
that
i
can
see
there
is
one
obvious
way
no
no
evelyn
i
shall
never
abandon
you--never
it
will
come
right--depend
upon
it
it
will
come
right
and
surely
it
looks
like
the
interference
of
providence
that
so
perfect
an
instrument
should
be
put
into
our
hands
my
position
was
embarrassing
for
i
felt
that
for
the
instant
they
had
forgotten
my
presence
but
lord
linchmere
came
back
suddenly
to
me
and
to
my
engagement
the
business
for
which
i
want
you
dr
hamilton
is
that
you
should
put
yourself
absolutely
at
my
disposal
i
wish
you
to
come
for
a
short
journey
with
me
to
remain
always
at
my
side
and
to
promise
to
do
without
question
whatever
i
may
ask
you
however
unreasonable
it
may
appear
to
you
to
be
that
is
a
good
deal
to
ask
said
i
unfortunately
i
cannot
put
it
more
plainly
for
i
do
not
myself
know
what
turn
matters
may
take
you
may
be
sure
however
that
you
will
not
be
asked
to
do
anything
which
your
conscience
does
not
approve
and
i
promise
you
that
when
all
is
over
you
will
be
proud
to
have
been
concerned
in
so
good
a
work
if
it
ends
happily
said
the
lady
exactly
if
it
ends
happily
his
lordship
repeated
and
terms
i
asked
twenty
pounds
a
day
i
was
amazed
at
the
sum
and
must
have
showed
my
surprise
upon
my
features
it
is
a
rare
combination
of
qualities
as
must
have
struck
you
when
you
first
read
the
advertisement
said
lord
linchmere
such
varied
gifts
may
well
command
a
high
return
and
i
do
not
conceal
from
you
that
your
duties
might
be
arduous
or
even
dangerous
besides
it
is
possible
that
one
or
two
days
may
bring
the
matter
to
an
end
please
god
sighed
his
sister
so
now
dr
hamilton
may
i
rely
upon
your
aid
most
undoubtedly
said
i
you
have
only
to
tell
me
what
my
duties
are
your
first
duty
will
be
to
return
to
your
home
you
will
pack
up
whatever
you
may
need
for
a
short
visit
to
the
country
we
start
together
from
paddington
station
at
340
this
afternoon
do
we
go
far
as
far
as
pangbourne
meet
me
at
the
bookstall
at
330
i
shall
have
the
tickets
goodbye
dr
hamilton
and
by
the
way
there
are
two
things
which
i
should
be
very
glad
if
you
would
bring
with
you
in
case
you
have
them
one
is
your
case
for
collecting
beetles
and
the
other
is
a
stick
and
the
thicker
and
heavier
the
better
you
may
imagine
that
i
had
plenty
to
think
of
from
the
time
that
i
left
brook
street
until
i
set
out
to
meet
lord
linchmere
at
paddington
the
whole
fantastic
business
kept
arranging
and
rearranging
itself
in
kaleidoscopic
forms
inside
my
brain
until
i
had
thought
out
a
dozen
explanations
each
of
them
more
grotesquely
improbable
than
the
last
and
yet
i
felt
that
the
truth
must
be
something
grotesquely
improbable
also
at
last
i
gave
up
all
attempts
at
finding
a
solution
and
contented
myself
with
exactly
carrying
out
the
instructions
which
i
had
received
with
a
hand
valise
specimen-case
and
a
loaded
cane
i
was
waiting
at
the
paddington
bookstall
when
lord
linchmere
arrived
he
was
an
even
smaller
man
than
i
had
thought--frail
and
peaky
with
a
manner
which
was
more
nervous
than
it
had
been
in
the
morning
he
wore
a
long
thick
travelling
ulster
and
i
observed
that
he
carried
a
heavy
blackthorn
cudgel
in
his
hand
i
have
the
tickets
said
he
leading
the
way
up
the
platform
this
is
our
train
i
have
engaged
a
carriage
for
i
am
particularly
anxious
to
impress
one
or
two
things
upon
you
while
we
travel
down
and
yet
all
that
he
had
to
impress
upon
me
might
have
been
said
in
a
sentence
for
it
was
that
i
was
to
remember
that
i
was
there
as
a
protection
to
himself
and
that
i
was
not
on
any
consideration
to
leave
him
for
an
instant
this
he
repeated
again
and
again
as
our
journey
drew
to
a
close
with
an
insistence
which
showed
that
his
nerves
were
thoroughly
shaken
yes
he
said
at
last
in
answer
to
my
looks
rather
than
to
my
words
i
am
nervous
dr
hamilton
i
have
always
been
a
timid
man
and
my
timidity
depends
upon
my
frail
physical
health
but
my
soul
is
firm
and
i
can
bring
myself
up
to
face
a
danger
which
a
less-nervous
man
might
shrink
from
what
i
am
doing
now
is
done
from
no
compulsion
but
entirely
from
a
sense
of
duty
and
yet
it
is
beyond
doubt
a
desperate
risk
if
things
should
go
wrong
i
will
have
some
claims
to
the
title
of
martyr
this
eternal
reading
of
riddles
was
too
much
for
me
i
felt
that
i
must
put
a
term
to
it
i
think
it
would
very
much
better
sir
if
you
were
to
trust
me
entirely
said
i
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
act
effectively
when
i
do
not
know
what
are
the
objects
which
we
have
in
view
or
even
where
we
are
going
oh
as
to
where
we
are
going
there
need
be
no
mystery
about
that
said
he
we
are
going
to
delamere
court
the
residence
of
sir
thomas
rossiter
with
whose
work
you
are
so
conversant
as
to
the
exact
object
of
our
visit
i
do
not
know
that
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
anything
would
be
gained
dr
hamilton
by
taking
you
into
my
complete
confidence
i
may
tell
you
that
we
are
acting--i
say
'we'
because
my
sister
lady
rossiter
takes
the
same
view
as
myself--with
the
one
object
of
preventing
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
family
scandal
that
being
so
you
can
understand
that
i
am
loath
to
give
any
explanations
which
are
not
absolutely
necessary
it
would
be
a
different
matter
dr
hamilton
if
i
were
asking
your
advice
as
matters
stand
it
is
only
your
active
help
which
i
need
and
i
will
indicate
to
you
from
time
to
time
how
you
can
best
give
it
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
and
a
poor
man
can
put
up
with
a
good
deal
for
twenty
pounds
a
day
but
i
felt
none
the
less
that
lord
linchmere
was
acting
rather
scurvily
towards
me
he
wished
to
convert
me
into
a
passive
tool
like
the
blackthorn
in
his
hand
with
his
sensitive
disposition
i
could
imagine
however
that
scandal
would
be
abhorrent
to
him
and
i
realized
that
he
would
not
take
me
into
his
confidence
until
no
other
course
was
open
to
him
i
must
trust
to
my
own
eyes
and
ears
to
solve
the
mystery
but
i
had
every
confidence
that
i
should
not
trust
to
them
in
vain
delamere
court
lies
a
good
five
miles
from
pangbourne
station
and
we
drove
for
that
distance
in
an
open
fly
lord
linchmere
sat
in
deep
thought
during
the
time
and
he
never
opened
his
mouth
until
we
were
close
to
our
destination
when
he
did
speak
it
was
to
give
me
a
piece
of
information
which
surprised
me
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
said
he
that
i
am
a
medical
man
like
yourself
no
sir
i
did
not
know
it
yes
i
qualified
in
my
younger
days
when
there
were
several
lives
between
me
and
the
peerage
i
have
not
had
occasion
to
practise
but
i
have
found
it
a
useful
education
all
the
same
i
never
regretted
the
years
which
i
devoted
to
medical
study
these
are
the
gates
of
delamere
court
we
had
come
to
two
high
pillars
crowned
with
heraldic
monsters
which
flanked
the
opening
of
a
winding
avenue
over
the
laurel
bushes
and
rhododendrons
i
could
see
a
long
many-gabled
mansion
girdled
with
ivy
and
toned
to
the
warm
cheery
mellow
glow
of
old
brick-work
my
eyes
were
still
fixed
in
admiration
upon
this
delightful
house
when
my
companion
plucked
nervously
at
my
sleeve
here's
sir
thomas
he
whispered
please
talk
beetle
all
you
can
a
tall
thin
figure
curiously
angular
and
bony
had
emerged
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
of
laurels
in
his
hand
he
held
a
spud
and
he
wore
gauntleted
gardener's
gloves
a
broad-brimmed
grey
hat
cast
his
face
into
shadow
but
it
struck
me
as
exceedingly
austere
with
an
ill-nourished
beard
and
harsh
irregular
features
the
fly
pulled
up
and
lord
linchmere
sprang
out
my
dear
thomas
how
are
you
said
he
heartily
but
the
heartiness
was
by
no
means
reciprocal
the
owner
of
the
grounds
glared
at
me
over
his
brother-in-law's
shoulder
and
i
caught
broken
scraps
of
sentences--well-known
wishes

hatred
of
strangers

unjustifiable
intrusion

perfectly
inexcusable
then
there
was
a
muttered
explanation
and
the
two
of
them
came
over
together
to
the
side
of
the
fly
let
me
present
you
to
sir
thomas
rossiter
dr
hamilton
said
lord
linchmere
you
will
find
that
you
have
a
strong
community
of
tastes
i
bowed
sir
thomas
stood
very
stiffly
looking
at
me
severely
from
under
the
broad
brim
of
his
hat
lord
linchmere
tells
me
that
you
know
something
about
beetles
said
he
what
do
you
know
about
beetles
i
know
what
i
have
learned
from
your
work
upon
the
coleoptera
sir
thomas
i
answered
give
me
the
names
of
the
better-known
species
of
the
british
scarabaei
said
he
i
had
not
expected
an
examination
but
fortunately
i
was
ready
for
one
my
answers
seemed
to
please
him
for
his
stern
features
relaxed
you
appear
to
have
read
my
book
with
some
profit
sir
said
he
it
is
a
rare
thing
for
me
to
meet
anyone
who
takes
an
intelligent
interest
in
such
matters
people
can
find
time
for
such
trivialities
as
sport
or
society
and
yet
the
beetles
are
overlooked
i
can
assure
you
that
the
greater
part
of
the
idiots
in
this
part
of
the
country
are
unaware
that
i
have
ever
written
a
book
at
all--i
the
first
man
who
ever
described
the
true
function
of
the
elytra
i
am
glad
to
see
you
sir
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
can
show
you
some
specimens
which
will
interest
you
he
stepped
into
the
fly
and
drove
up
with
us
to
the
house
expounding
to
me
as
we
went
some
recent
researches
which
he
had
made
into
the
anatomy
of
the
lady-bird
i
have
said
that
sir
thomas
rossiter
wore
a
large
hat
drawn
down
over
his
brows
as
he
entered
the
hall
he
uncovered
himself
and
i
was
at
once
aware
of
a
singular
characteristic
which
the
hat
had
concealed
his
forehead
which
was
naturally
high
and
higher
still
on
account
of
receding
hair
was
in
a
continual
state
of
movement
some
nervous
weakness
kept
the
muscles
in
a
constant
spasm
which
sometimes
produced
a
mere
twitching
and
sometimes
a
curious
rotary
movement
unlike
anything
which
i
had
ever
seen
before
it
was
strikingly
visible
as
he
turned
towards
us
after
entering
the
study
and
seemed
the
more
singular
from
the
contrast
with
the
hard
steady
grey
eyes
which
looked
out
from
underneath
those
palpitating
brows
i
am
sorry
said
he
that
lady
rossiter
is
not
here
to
help
me
to
welcome
you
by
the
way
charles
did
evelyn
say
anything
about
the
date
of
her
return
she
wished
to
stay
in
town
for
a
few
more
days
said
lord
linchmere
you
know
how
ladies'
social
duties
accumulate
if
they
have
been
for
some
time
in
the
country
my
sister
has
many
old
friends
in
london
at
present
well
she
is
her
own
mistress
and
i
should
not
wish
to
alter
her
plans
but
i
shall
be
glad
when
i
see
her
again
it
is
very
lonely
here
without
her
company
i
was
afraid
that
you
might
find
it
so
and
that
was
partly
why
i
ran
down
my
young
friend
dr
hamilton
is
so
much
interested
in
the
subject
which
you
have
made
your
own
that
i
thought
you
would
not
mind
his
accompanying
me
i
lead
a
retired
life
dr
hamilton
and
my
aversion
to
strangers
grows
upon
me
said
our
host
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
my
nerves
are
not
so
good
as
they
were
my
travels
in
search
of
beetles
in
my
younger
days
took
me
into
many
malarious
and
unhealthy
places
but
a
brother
coleopterist
like
yourself
is
always
a
welcome
guest
and
i
shall
be
delighted
if
you
will
look
over
my
collection
which
i
think
that
i
may
without
exaggeration
describe
as
the
best
in
europe
and
so
no
doubt
it
was
he
had
a
huge
oaken
cabinet
arranged
in
shallow
drawers
and
here
neatly
ticketed
and
classified
were
beetles
from
every
corner
of
the
earth
black
brown
blue
green
and
mottled
every
now
and
then
as
he
swept
his
hand
over
the
lines
and
lines
of
impaled
insects
he
would
catch
up
some
rare
specimen
and
handling
it
with
as
much
delicacy
and
reverence
as
if
it
were
a
precious
relic
he
would
hold
forth
upon
its
peculiarities
and
the
circumstances
under
which
it
came
into
his
possession
it
was
evidently
an
unusual
thing
for
him
to
meet
with
a
sympathetic
listener
and
he
talked
and
talked
until
the
spring
evening
had
deepened
into
night
and
the
gong
announced
that
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
all
the
time
lord
linchmere
said
nothing
but
he
stood
at
his
brother-in-law's
elbow
and
i
caught
him
continually
shooting
curious
little
questioning
glances
into
his
face
and
his
own
features
expressed
some
strong
emotion
apprehension
sympathy
expectation
i
seemed
to
read
them
all
i
was
sure
that
lord
linchmere
was
fearing
something
and
awaiting
something
but
what
that
something
might
be
i
could
not
imagine
the
evening
passed
quietly
but
pleasantly
and
i
should
have
been
entirely
at
my
ease
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
continual
sense
of
tension
upon
the
part
of
lord
linchmere
as
to
our
host
i
found
that
he
improved
upon
acquaintance
he
spoke
constantly
with
affection
of
his
absent
wife
and
also
of
his
little
son
who
had
recently
been
sent
to
school
the
house
he
said
was
not
the
same
without
them
if
it
were
not
for
his
scientific
studies
he
did
not
know
how
he
could
get
through
the
days
after
dinner
we
smoked
for
some
time
in
the
billiard-room
and
finally
went
early
to
bed
and
then
it
was
that
for
the
first
time
the
suspicion
that
lord
linchmere
was
a
lunatic
crossed
my
mind
he
followed
me
into
my
bedroom
when
our
host
had
retired
doctor
said
he
speaking
in
a
low
hurried
voice
you
must
come
with
me
you
must
spend
the
night
in
my
bedroom
what
do
you
mean
i
prefer
not
to
explain
but
this
is
part
of
your
duties
my
room
is
close
by
and
you
can
return
to
your
own
before
the
servant
calls
you
in
the
morning
but
why
i
asked
because
i
am
nervous
of
being
alone
said
he
that's
the
reason
since
you
must
have
a
reason
it
seemed
rank
lunacy
but
the
argument
of
those
twenty
pounds
would
overcome
many
objections
i
followed
him
to
his
room
well
said
i
there's
only
room
for
one
in
that
bed
only
one
shall
occupy
it
said
he
and
the
other
must
remain
on
watch
why
said
i
one
would
think
you
expected
to
be
attacked
perhaps
i
do
in
that
case
why
not
lock
your
door
perhaps
i
want
to
be
attacked
it
looked
more
and
more
like
lunacy
however
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
submit
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
sat
down
in
the
arm-chair
beside
the
empty
fireplace
i
am
to
remain
on
watch
then
said
i
ruefully
we
will
divide
the
night
if
you
will
watch
until
two
i
will
watch
the
remainder
very
good
call
me
at
two
o'clock
then
i
will
do
so
keep
your
ears
open
and
if
you
hear
any
sounds
wake
me
instantly--instantly
you
hear
you
can
rely
upon
it
i
tried
to
look
as
solemn
as
he
did
and
for
god's
sake
don't
go
to
sleep
said
he
and
so
taking
off
only
his
coat
he
threw
the
coverlet
over
him
and
settled
down
for
the
night
it
was
a
melancholy
vigil
and
made
more
so
by
my
own
sense
of
its
folly
supposing
that
by
any
chance
lord
linchmere
had
cause
to
suspect
that
he
was
subject
to
danger
in
the
house
of
sir
thomas
rossiter
why
on
earth
could
he
not
lock
his
door
and
so
protect
himself
his
own
answer
that
he
might
wish
to
be
attacked
was
absurd
why
should
he
possibly
wish
to
be
attacked
and
who
would
wish
to
attack
him
clearly
lord
linchmere
was
suffering
from
some
singular
delusion
and
the
result
was
that
on
an
imbecile
pretext
i
was
to
be
deprived
of
my
night's
rest
still
however
absurd
i
was
determined
to
carry
out
his
injunctions
to
the
letter
as
long
as
i
was
in
his
employment
i
sat
therefore
beside
the
empty
fireplace
and
listened
to
a
sonorous
chiming
clock
somewhere
down
the
passage
which
gurgled
and
struck
every
quarter
of
an
hour
it
was
an
endless
vigil
save
for
that
single
clock
an
absolute
silence
reigned
throughout
the
great
house
a
small
lamp
stood
on
the
table
at
my
elbow
throwing
a
circle
of
light
round
my
chair
but
leaving
the
corners
of
the
room
draped
in
shadow
on
the
bed
lord
linchmere
was
breathing
peacefully
i
envied
him
his
quiet
sleep
and
again
and
again
my
own
eyelids
drooped
but
every
time
my
sense
of
duty
came
to
my
help
and
i
sat
up
rubbing
my
eyes
and
pinching
myself
with
a
determination
to
see
my
irrational
watch
to
an
end
and
i
did
so
from
down
the
passage
came
the
chimes
of
two
o'clock
and
i
laid
my
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
sleeper
instantly
he
was
sitting
up
with
an
expression
of
the
keenest
interest
upon
his
face
you
have
heard
something
no
sir
it
is
two
o'clock
very
good
i
will
watch
you
can
go
to
sleep
i
lay
down
under
the
coverlet
as
he
had
done
and
was
soon
unconscious
my
last
recollection
was
of
that
circle
of
lamplight
and
of
the
small
hunched-up
figure
and
strained
anxious
face
of
lord
linchmere
in
the
centre
of
it
how
long
i
slept
i
do
not
know
but
i
was
suddenly
aroused
by
a
sharp
tug
at
my
sleeve
the
room
was
in
darkness
but
a
hot
smell
of
oil
told
me
that
the
lamp
had
only
that
instant
been
extinguished
quick
quick
said
lord
linchmere's
voice
in
my
ear
i
sprang
out
of
bed
he
still
dragging
at
my
arm
over
here
he
whispered
and
pulled
me
into
a
corner
of
the
room
hush
listen
in
the
silence
of
the
night
i
could
distinctly
hear
that
someone
was
coming
down
the
corridor
it
was
a
stealthy
step
faint
and
intermittent
as
of
a
man
who
paused
cautiously
after
every
stride
sometimes
for
half
a
minute
there
was
no
sound
and
then
came
the
shuffle
and
creak
which
told
of
a
fresh
advance
my
companion
was
trembling
with
excitement
his
hand
which
still
held
my
sleeve
twitched
like
a
branch
in
the
wind
what
is
it
i
whispered
it's
he
sir
thomas
yes
what
does
he
want
hush
do
nothing
until
i
tell
you
i
was
conscious
now
that
someone
was
trying
the
door
there
was
the
faintest
little
rattle
from
the
handle
and
then
i
dimly
saw
a
thin
slit
of
subdued
light
there
was
a
lamp
burning
somewhere
far
down
the
passage
and
it
just
sufficed
to
make
the
outside
visible
from
the
darkness
of
our
room
the
greyish
slit
grew
broader
and
broader
very
gradually
very
gently
and
then
outlined
against
it
i
saw
the
dark
figure
of
a
man
he
was
squat
and
crouching
with
the
silhouette
of
a
bulky
and
misshapen
dwarf
slowly
the
door
swung
open
with
this
ominous
shape
framed
in
the
centre
of
it
and
then
in
an
instant
the
crouching
figure
shot
up
there
was
a
tiger
spring
across
the
room
and
thud
thud
thud
came
three
tremendous
blows
from
some
heavy
object
upon
the
bed
i
was
so
paralysed
with
amazement
that
i
stood
motionless
and
staring
until
i
was
aroused
by
a
yell
for
help
from
my
companion
the
open
door
shed
enough
light
for
me
to
see
the
outline
of
things
and
there
was
little
lord
linchmere
with
his
arms
round
the
neck
of
his
brother-in-law
holding
bravely
on
to
him
like
a
game
bull-terrier
with
its
teeth
into
a
gaunt
deerhound
the
tall
bony
man
dashed
himself
about
writhing
round
and
round
to
get
a
grip
upon
his
assailant
but
the
other
clutching
on
from
behind
still
kept
his
hold
though
his
shrill
frightened
cries
showed
how
unequal
he
felt
the
contest
to
be
i
sprang
to
the
rescue
and
the
two
of
us
managed
to
throw
sir
thomas
to
the
ground
though
he
made
his
teeth
meet
in
my
shoulder
with
all
my
youth
and
weight
and
strength
it
was
a
desperate
struggle
before
we
could
master
his
frenzied
struggles
but
at
last
we
secured
his
arms
with
the
waist-cord
of
the
dressing-gown
which
he
was
wearing
i
was
holding
his
legs
while
lord
linchmere
was
endeavouring
to
relight
the
lamp
when
there
came
the
pattering
of
many
feet
in
the
passage
and
the
butler
and
two
footmen
who
had
been
alarmed
by
the
cries
rushed
into
the
room
with
their
aid
we
had
no
further
difficulty
in
securing
our
prisoner
who
lay
foaming
and
glaring
upon
the
ground
one
glance
at
his
face
was
enough
to
prove
that
he
was
a
dangerous
maniac
while
the
short
heavy
hammer
which
lay
beside
the
bed
showed
how
murderous
had
been
his
intentions
do
not
use
any
violence
said
lord
linchmere
as
we
raised
the
struggling
man
to
his
feet
he
will
have
a
period
of
stupor
after
this
excitement
i
believe
that
it
is
coming
on
already
as
he
spoke
the
convulsions
became
less
violent
and
the
madman's
head
fell
forward
upon
his
breast
as
if
he
were
overcome
by
sleep
we
led
him
down
the
passage
and
stretched
him
upon
his
own
bed
where
he
lay
unconscious
breathing
heavily
two
of
you
will
watch
him
said
lord
linchmere
and
now
dr
hamilton
if
you
will
return
with
me
to
my
room
i
will
give
you
the
explanation
which
my
horror
of
scandal
has
perhaps
caused
me
to
delay
too
long
come
what
may
you
will
never
have
cause
to
regret
your
share
in
this
night's
work
the
case
may
be
made
clear
in
a
very
few
words
he
continued
when
we
were
alone
my
poor
brother-in-law
is
one
of
the
best
fellows
upon
earth
a
loving
husband
and
an
estimable
father
but
he
comes
from
a
stock
which
is
deeply
tainted
with
insanity
he
has
more
than
once
had
homicidal
outbreaks
which
are
the
more
painful
because
his
inclination
is
always
to
attack
the
very
person
to
whom
he
is
most
attached
his
son
was
sent
away
to
school
to
avoid
this
danger
and
then
came
an
attempt
upon
my
sister
his
wife
from
which
she
escaped
with
injuries
that
you
may
have
observed
when
you
met
her
in
london
you
understand
that
he
knows
nothing
of
the
matter
when
he
is
in
his
sound
senses
and
would
ridicule
the
suggestion
that
he
could
under
any
circumstances
injure
those
whom
he
loves
so
dearly
it
is
often
as
you
know
a
characteristic
of
such
maladies
that
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
convince
the
man
who
suffers
from
them
of
their
existence
our
great
object
was
of
course
to
get
him
under
restraint
before
he
could
stain
his
hands
with
blood
but
the
matter
was
full
of
difficulty
he
is
a
recluse
in
his
habits
and
would
not
see
any
medical
man
besides
it
was
necessary
for
our
purpose
that
the
medical
man
should
convince
himself
of
his
insanity
and
he
is
sane
as
you
or
i
save
on
these
very
rare
occasions
but
fortunately
before
he
has
these
attacks
he
always
shows
certain
premonitory
symptoms
which
are
providential
danger-signals
warning
us
to
be
upon
our
guard
the
chief
of
these
is
that
nervous
contortion
of
the
forehead
which
you
must
have
observed
this
is
a
phenomenon
which
always
appears
from
three
to
four
days
before
his
attacks
of
frenzy
the
moment
it
showed
itself
his
wife
came
into
town
on
some
pretext
and
took
refuge
in
my
house
in
brook
street
it
remained
for
me
to
convince
a
medical
man
of
sir
thomas's
insanity
without
which
it
was
impossible
to
put
him
where
he
could
do
no
harm
the
first
problem
was
how
to
get
a
medical
man
into
his
house
i
bethought
me
of
his
interest
in
beetles
and
his
love
for
anyone
who
shared
his
tastes
i
advertised
therefore
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
in
you
the
very
man
i
wanted
a
stout
companion
was
necessary
for
i
knew
that
the
lunacy
could
only
be
proved
by
a
murderous
assault
and
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
that
assault
would
be
made
upon
myself
since
he
had
the
warmest
regard
for
me
in
his
moments
of
sanity
i
think
your
intelligence
will
supply
all
the
rest
i
did
not
know
that
the
attack
would
come
by
night
but
i
thought
it
very
probable
for
the
crises
of
such
cases
usually
do
occur
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
i
am
a
very
nervous
man
myself
but
i
saw
no
other
way
in
which
i
could
remove
this
terrible
danger
from
my
sister's
life
i
need
not
ask
you
whether
you
are
willing
to
sign
the
lunacy
papers
undoubtedly
but
two
signatures
are
necessary
you
forget
that
i
am
myself
a
holder
of
a
medical
degree
i
have
the
papers
on
a
side-table
here
so
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
sign
them
now
we
can
have
the
patient
removed
in
the
morning
so
that
was
my
visit
to
sir
thomas
rossiter
the
famous
beetle-hunter
and
that
was
also
my
first
step
upon
the
ladder
of
success
for
lady
rossiter
and
lord
linchmere
have
proved
to
be
staunch
friends
and
they
have
never
forgotten
my
association
with
them
in
the
time
of
their
need
sir
thomas
is
out
and
said
to
be
cured
but
i
still
think
that
if
i
spent
another
night
at
delamere
court
i
should
be
inclined
to
lock
my
door
upon
the
inside
the
man
with
the
watches
there
are
many
who
will
still
bear
in
mind
the
singular
circumstances
which
under
the
heading
of
the
rugby
mystery
filled
many
columns
of
the
daily
press
in
the
spring
of
the
year
1892
coming
as
it
did
at
a
period
of
exceptional
dullness
it
attracted
perhaps
rather
more
attention
than
it
deserved
but
it
offered
to
the
public
that
mixture
of
the
whimsical
and
the
tragic
which
is
most
stimulating
to
the
popular
imagination
interest
drooped
however
when
after
weeks
of
fruitless
investigation
it
was
found
that
no
final
explanation
of
the
facts
was
forthcoming
and
the
tragedy
seemed
from
that
time
to
the
present
to
have
finally
taken
its
place
in
the
dark
catalogue
of
inexplicable
and
unexpiated
crimes
a
recent
communication
the
authenticity
of
which
appears
to
be
above
question
has
however
thrown
some
new
and
clear
light
upon
the
matter
before
laying
it
before
the
public
it
would
be
as
well
perhaps
that
i
should
refresh
their
memories
as
to
the
singular
facts
upon
which
this
commentary
is
founded
these
facts
were
briefly
as
follows
at
five
o'clock
on
the
evening
of
the
18th
of
march
in
the
year
already
mentioned
a
train
left
euston
station
for
manchester
it
was
a
rainy
squally
day
which
grew
wilder
as
it
progressed
so
it
was
by
no
means
the
weather
in
which
anyone
would
travel
who
was
not
driven
to
do
so
by
necessity
the
train
however
is
a
favourite
one
among
manchester
business
men
who
are
returning
from
town
for
it
does
the
journey
in
four
hours
and
twenty
minutes
with
only
three
stoppages
upon
the
way
in
spite
of
the
inclement
evening
it
was
therefore
fairly
well
filled
upon
the
occasion
of
which
i
speak
the
guard
of
the
train
was
a
tried
servant
of
the
company--a
man
who
had
worked
for
twenty-two
years
without
a
blemish
or
complaint
his
name
was
john
palmer
the
station
clock
was
upon
the
stroke
of
five
and
the
guard
was
about
to
give
the
customary
signal
to
the
engine-driver
when
he
observed
two
belated
passengers
hurrying
down
the
platform
the
one
was
an
exceptionally
tall
man
dressed
in
a
long
black
overcoat
with
astrakhan
collar
and
cuffs
i
have
already
said
that
the
evening
was
an
inclement
one
and
the
tall
traveller
had
the
high
warm
collar
turned
up
to
protect
his
throat
against
the
bitter
march
wind
he
appeared
as
far
as
the
guard
could
judge
by
so
hurried
an
inspection
to
be
a
man
between
fifty
and
sixty
years
of
age
who
had
retained
a
good
deal
of
the
vigour
and
activity
of
his
youth
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
brown
leather
gladstone
bag
his
companion
was
a
lady
tall
and
erect
walking
with
a
vigorous
step
which
outpaced
the
gentleman
beside
her
she
wore
a
long
fawn-coloured
dust-cloak
a
black
close-fitting
toque
and
a
dark
veil
which
concealed
the
greater
part
of
her
face
the
two
might
very
well
have
passed
as
father
and
daughter
they
walked
swiftly
down
the
line
of
carriages
glancing
in
at
the
windows
until
the
guard
john
palmer
overtook
them
now
then
sir
look
sharp
the
train
is
going
said
he
first-class
the
man
answered
the
guard
turned
the
handle
of
the
nearest
door
in
the
carriage
which
he
had
opened
there
sat
a
small
man
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
his
appearance
seems
to
have
impressed
itself
upon
the
guard's
memory
for
he
was
prepared
afterwards
to
describe
or
to
identify
him
he
was
a
man
of
thirty-four
or
thirty-five
years
of
age
dressed
in
some
grey
material
sharp-nosed
alert
with
a
ruddy
weather-beaten
face
and
a
small
closely
cropped
black
beard
he
glanced
up
as
the
door
was
opened
the
tall
man
paused
with
his
foot
upon
the
step
this
is
a
smoking
compartment
the
lady
dislikes
smoke
said
he
looking
round
at
the
guard
all
right
here
you
are
sir
said
john
palmer
he
slammed
the
door
of
the
smoking
carriage
opened
that
of
the
next
one
which
was
empty
and
thrust
the
two
travellers
in
at
the
same
moment
he
sounded
his
whistle
and
the
wheels
of
the
train
began
to
move
the
man
with
the
cigar
was
at
the
window
of
his
carriage
and
said
something
to
the
guard
as
he
rolled
past
him
but
the
words
were
lost
in
the
bustle
of
the
departure
palmer
stepped
into
the
guard's
van
as
it
came
up
to
him
and
thought
no
more
of
the
incident
twelve
minutes
after
its
departure
the
train
reached
willesden
junction
where
it
stopped
for
a
very
short
interval
an
examination
of
the
tickets
has
made
it
certain
that
no
one
either
joined
or
left
it
at
this
time
and
no
passenger
was
seen
to
alight
upon
the
platform
at
514
the
journey
to
manchester
was
resumed
and
rugby
was
reached
at
650
the
express
being
five
minutes
late
at
rugby
the
attention
of
the
station
officials
was
drawn
to
the
fact
that
the
door
of
one
of
the
first-class
carriages
was
open
an
examination
of
that
compartment
and
of
its
neighbour
disclosed
a
remarkable
state
of
affairs
the
smoking
carriage
in
which
the
short
red-faced
man
with
the
black
beard
had
been
seen
was
now
empty
save
for
a
half-smoked
cigar
there
was
no
trace
whatever
of
its
recent
occupant
the
door
of
this
carriage
was
fastened
in
the
next
compartment
to
which
attention
had
been
originally
drawn
there
was
no
sign
either
of
the
gentleman
with
the
astrakhan
collar
or
of
the
young
lady
who
accompanied
him
all
three
passengers
had
disappeared
on
the
other
hand
there
was
found
upon
the
floor
of
this
carriage--the
one
in
which
the
tall
traveller
and
the
lady
had
been--a
young
man
fashionably
dressed
and
of
elegant
appearance
he
lay
with
his
knees
drawn
up
and
his
head
resting
against
the
farther
door
an
elbow
upon
either
seat
a
bullet
had
penetrated
his
heart
and
his
death
must
have
been
instantaneous
no
one
had
seen
such
a
man
enter
the
train
and
no
railway
ticket
was
found
in
his
pocket
neither
were
there
any
markings
upon
his
linen
nor
papers
nor
personal
property
which
might
help
to
identify
him
who
he
was
whence
he
had
come
and
how
he
had
met
his
end
were
each
as
great
a
mystery
as
what
had
occurred
to
the
three
people
who
had
started
an
hour
and
a
half
before
from
willesden
in
those
two
compartments
i
have
said
that
there
was
no
personal
property
which
might
help
to
identify
him
but
it
is
true
that
there
was
one
peculiarity
about
this
unknown
young
man
which
was
much
commented
upon
at
the
time
in
his
pockets
were
found
no
fewer
than
six
valuable
gold
watches
three
in
the
various
pockets
of
his
waist-coat
one
in
his
ticket-pocket
one
in
his
breast-pocket
and
one
small
one
set
in
a
leather
strap
and
fastened
round
his
left
wrist
the
obvious
explanation
that
the
man
was
a
pickpocket
and
that
this
was
his
plunder
was
discounted
by
the
fact
that
all
six
were
of
american
make
and
of
a
type
which
is
rare
in
england
three
of
them
bore
the
mark
of
the
rochester
watchmaking
company
one
was
by
mason
of
elmira
one
was
unmarked
and
the
small
one
which
was
highly
jewelled
and
ornamented
was
from
tiffany
of
new
york
the
other
contents
of
his
pocket
consisted
of
an
ivory
knife
with
a
corkscrew
by
rodgers
of
sheffield
a
small
circular
mirror
one
inch
in
diameter
a
readmission
slip
to
the
lyceum
theatre
a
silver
box
full
of
vesta
matches
and
a
brown
leather
cigar-case
containing
two
cheroots--also
two
pounds
fourteen
shillings
in
money
it
was
clear
then
that
whatever
motives
may
have
led
to
his
death
robbery
was
not
among
them
as
already
mentioned
there
were
no
markings
upon
the
man's
linen
which
appeared
to
be
new
and
no
tailor's
name
upon
his
coat
in
appearance
he
was
young
short
smooth-cheeked
and
delicately
featured
one
of
his
front
teeth
was
conspicuously
stopped
with
gold
on
the
discovery
of
the
tragedy
an
examination
was
instantly
made
of
the
tickets
of
all
passengers
and
the
number
of
the
passengers
themselves
was
counted
it
was
found
that
only
three
tickets
were
unaccounted
for
corresponding
to
the
three
travellers
who
were
missing
the
express
was
then
allowed
to
proceed
but
a
new
guard
was
sent
with
it
and
john
palmer
was
detained
as
a
witness
at
rugby
the
carriage
which
included
the
two
compartments
in
question
was
uncoupled
and
side-tracked
then
on
the
arrival
of
inspector
vane
of
scotland
yard
and
of
mr
henderson
a
detective
in
the
service
of
the
railway
company
an
exhaustive
inquiry
was
made
into
all
the
circumstances
that
crime
had
been
committed
was
certain
the
bullet
which
appeared
to
have
come
from
a
small
pistol
or
revolver
had
been
fired
from
some
little
distance
as
there
was
no
scorching
of
the
clothes
no
weapon
was
found
in
the
compartment
which
finally
disposed
of
the
theory
of
suicide
nor
was
there
any
sign
of
the
brown
leather
bag
which
the
guard
had
seen
in
the
hand
of
the
tall
gentleman
a
lady's
parasol
was
found
upon
the
rack
but
no
other
trace
was
to
be
seen
of
the
travellers
in
either
of
the
sections
apart
from
the
crime
the
question
of
how
or
why
three
passengers
one
of
them
a
lady
could
get
out
of
the
train
and
one
other
get
in
during
the
unbroken
run
between
willesden
and
rugby
was
one
which
excited
the
utmost
curiosity
among
the
general
public
and
gave
rise
to
much
speculation
in
the
london
press
john
palmer
the
guard
was
able
at
the
inquest
to
give
some
evidence
which
threw
a
little
light
upon
the
matter
there
was
a
spot
between
tring
and
cheddington
according
to
his
statement
where
on
account
of
some
repairs
to
the
line
the
train
had
for
a
few
minutes
slowed
down
to
a
pace
not
exceeding
eight
or
ten
miles
an
hour
at
that
place
it
might
be
possible
for
a
man
or
even
for
an
exceptionally
active
woman
to
have
left
the
train
without
serious
injury
it
was
true
that
a
gang
of
platelayers
was
there
and
that
they
had
seen
nothing
but
it
was
their
custom
to
stand
in
the
middle
between
the
metals
and
the
open
carriage
door
was
upon
the
far
side
so
that
it
was
conceivable
that
someone
might
have
alighted
unseen
as
the
darkness
would
by
that
time
be
drawing
in
a
steep
embankment
would
instantly
screen
anyone
who
sprang
out
from
the
observation
of
the
navvies
the
guard
also
deposed
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
movement
upon
the
platform
at
willesden
junction
and
that
though
it
was
certain
that
no
one
had
either
joined
or
left
the
train
there
it
was
still
quite
possible
that
some
of
the
passengers
might
have
changed
unseen
from
one
compartment
to
another
it
was
by
no
means
uncommon
for
a
gentleman
to
finish
his
cigar
in
a
smoking
carriage
and
then
to
change
to
a
clearer
atmosphere
supposing
that
the
man
with
the
black
beard
had
done
so
at
willesden
and
the
half-smoked
cigar
upon
the
floor
seemed
to
favour
the
supposition
he
would
naturally
go
into
the
nearest
section
which
would
bring
him
into
the
company
of
the
two
other
actors
in
this
drama
thus
the
first
stage
of
the
affair
might
be
surmised
without
any
great
breach
of
probability
but
what
the
second
stage
had
been
or
how
the
final
one
had
been
arrived
at
neither
the
guard
nor
the
experienced
detective
officers
could
suggest
a
careful
examination
of
the
line
between
willesden
and
rugby
resulted
in
one
discovery
which
might
or
might
not
have
a
bearing
upon
the
tragedy
near
tring
at
the
very
place
where
the
train
slowed
down
there
was
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
embankment
a
small
pocket
testament
very
shabby
and
worn
it
was
printed
by
the
bible
society
of
london
and
bore
an
inscription
from
john
to
alice
jan
13th
1856
upon
the
fly-leaf
underneath
was
written
james
july
4th
1859
and
beneath
that
again
edward
nov
1st
1869
all
the
entries
being
in
the
same
handwriting
this
was
the
only
clue
if
it
could
be
called
a
clue
which
the
police
obtained
and
the
coroner's
verdict
of
murder
by
a
person
or
persons
unknown
was
the
unsatisfactory
ending
of
a
singular
case
advertisement
rewards
and
inquiries
proved
equally
fruitless
and
nothing
could
be
found
which
was
solid
enough
to
form
the
basis
for
a
profitable
investigation
it
would
be
a
mistake
however
to
suppose
that
no
theories
were
formed
to
account
for
the
facts
on
the
contrary
the
press
both
in
england
and
in
america
teemed
with
suggestions
and
suppositions
most
of
which
were
obviously
absurd
the
fact
that
the
watches
were
of
american
make
and
some
peculiarities
in
connection
with
the
gold
stopping
of
his
front
tooth
appeared
to
indicate
that
the
deceased
was
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
though
his
linen
clothes
and
boots
were
undoubtedly
of
british
manufacture
it
was
surmised
by
some
that
he
was
concealed
under
the
seat
and
that
being
discovered
he
was
for
some
reason
possibly
because
he
had
overheard
their
guilty
secrets
put
to
death
by
his
fellow-passengers
when
coupled
with
generalities
as
to
the
ferocity
and
cunning
of
anarchical
and
other
secret
societies
this
theory
sounded
as
plausible
as
any
the
fact
that
he
should
be
without
a
ticket
would
be
consistent
with
the
idea
of
concealment
and
it
was
well
known
that
women
played
a
prominent
part
in
the
nihilistic
propaganda
on
the
other
hand
it
was
clear
from
the
guard's
statement
that
the
man
must
have
been
hidden
there
before
the
others
arrived
and
how
unlikely
the
coincidence
that
conspirators
should
stray
exactly
into
the
very
compartment
in
which
a
spy
was
already
concealed
besides
this
explanation
ignored
the
man
in
the
smoking
carriage
and
gave
no
reason
at
all
for
his
simultaneous
disappearance
the
police
had
little
difficulty
in
showing
that
such
a
theory
would
not
cover
the
facts
but
they
were
unprepared
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
advance
any
alternative
explanation
there
was
a
letter
in
the
daily
gazette
over
the
signature
of
a
well-known
criminal
investigator
which
gave
rise
to
considerable
discussion
at
the
time
he
had
formed
a
hypothesis
which
had
at
least
ingenuity
to
recommend
it
and
i
cannot
do
better
than
append
it
in
his
own
words
whatever
may
be
the
truth
said
he
it
must
depend
upon
some
bizarre
and
rare
combination
of
events
so
we
need
have
no
hesitation
in
postulating
such
events
in
our
explanation
in
the
absence
of
data
we
must
abandon
the
analytic
or
scientific
method
of
investigation
and
must
approach
it
in
the
synthetic
fashion
in
a
word
instead
of
taking
known
events
and
deducing
from
them
what
has
occurred
we
must
build
up
a
fanciful
explanation
if
it
will
only
be
consistent
with
known
events
we
can
then
test
this
explanation
by
any
fresh
facts
which
may
arise
if
they
all
fit
into
their
places
the
probability
is
that
we
are
upon
the
right
track
and
with
each
fresh
fact
this
probability
increases
in
a
geometrical
progression
until
the
evidence
becomes
final
and
convincing
now
there
is
one
most
remarkable
and
suggestive
fact
which
has
not
met
with
the
attention
which
it
deserves
there
is
a
local
train
running
through
harrow
and
king's
langley
which
is
timed
in
such
a
way
that
the
express
must
have
overtaken
it
at
or
about
the
period
when
it
eased
down
its
speed
to
eight
miles
an
hour
on
account
of
the
repairs
of
the
line
the
two
trains
would
at
that
time
be
travelling
in
the
same
direction
at
a
similar
rate
of
speed
and
upon
parallel
lines
it
is
within
every
one's
experience
how
under
such
circumstances
the
occupant
of
each
carriage
can
see
very
plainly
the
passengers
in
the
other
carriages
opposite
to
him
the
lamps
of
the
express
had
been
lit
at
willesden
so
that
each
compartment
was
brightly
illuminated
and
most
visible
to
an
observer
from
outside
now
the
sequence
of
events
as
i
reconstruct
them
would
be
after
this
fashion
this
young
man
with
the
abnormal
number
of
watches
was
alone
in
the
carriage
of
the
slow
train
his
ticket
with
his
papers
and
gloves
and
other
things
was
we
will
suppose
on
the
seat
beside
him
he
was
probably
an
american
and
also
probably
a
man
of
weak
intellect
the
excessive
wearing
of
jewellery
is
an
early
symptom
in
some
forms
of
mania
as
he
sat
watching
the
carriages
of
the
express
which
were
on
account
of
the
state
of
the
line
going
at
the
same
pace
as
himself
he
suddenly
saw
some
people
in
it
whom
he
knew
we
will
suppose
for
the
sake
of
our
theory
that
these
people
were
a
woman
whom
he
loved
and
a
man
whom
he
hated--and
who
in
return
hated
him
the
young
man
was
excitable
and
impulsive
he
opened
the
door
of
his
carriage
stepped
from
the
footboard
of
the
local
train
to
the
footboard
of
the
express
opened
the
other
door
and
made
his
way
into
the
presence
of
these
two
people
the
feat
on
the
supposition
that
the
trains
were
going
at
the
same
pace
is
by
no
means
so
perilous
as
it
might
appear
having
now
got
our
young
man
without
his
ticket
into
the
carriage
in
which
the
elder
man
and
the
young
woman
are
travelling
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
that
a
violent
scene
ensued
it
is
possible
that
the
pair
were
also
americans
which
is
the
more
probable
as
the
man
carried
a
weapon--an
unusual
thing
in
england
if
our
supposition
of
incipient
mania
is
correct
the
young
man
is
likely
to
have
assaulted
the
other
as
the
upshot
of
the
quarrel
the
elder
man
shot
the
intruder
and
then
made
his
escape
from
the
carriage
taking
the
young
lady
with
him
we
will
suppose
that
all
this
happened
very
rapidly
and
that
the
train
was
still
going
at
so
slow
a
pace
that
it
was
not
difficult
for
them
to
leave
it
a
woman
might
leave
a
train
going
at
eight
miles
an
hour
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
know
that
this
woman
did
do
so
and
now
we
have
to
fit
in
the
man
in
the
smoking
carriage
presuming
that
we
have
up
to
this
point
reconstructed
the
tragedy
correctly
we
shall
find
nothing
in
this
other
man
to
cause
us
to
reconsider
our
conclusions
according
to
my
theory
this
man
saw
the
young
fellow
cross
from
one
train
to
the
other
saw
him
open
the
door
heard
the
pistol-shot
saw
the
two
fugitives
spring
out
on
to
the
line
realized
that
murder
had
been
done
and
sprang
out
himself
in
pursuit
why
he
has
never
been
heard
of
since--whether
he
met
his
own
death
in
the
pursuit
or
whether
as
is
more
likely
he
was
made
to
realize
that
it
was
not
a
case
for
his
interference--is
a
detail
which
we
have
at
present
no
means
of
explaining
i
acknowledge
that
there
are
some
difficulties
in
the
way
at
first
sight
it
might
seem
improbable
that
at
such
a
moment
a
murderer
would
burden
himself
in
his
flight
with
a
brown
leather
bag
my
answer
is
that
he
was
well
aware
that
if
the
bag
were
found
his
identity
would
be
established
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
take
it
with
him
my
theory
stands
or
falls
upon
one
point
and
i
call
upon
the
railway
company
to
make
strict
inquiry
as
to
whether
a
ticket
was
found
unclaimed
in
the
local
train
through
harrow
and
king's
langley
upon
the
18th
of
march
if
such
a
ticket
were
found
my
case
is
proved
if
not
my
theory
may
still
be
the
correct
one
for
it
is
conceivable
either
that
he
travelled
without
a
ticket
or
that
his
ticket
was
lost
to
this
elaborate
and
plausible
hypothesis
the
answer
of
the
police
and
of
the
company
was
first
that
no
such
ticket
was
found
secondly
that
the
slow
train
would
never
run
parallel
to
the
express
and
thirdly
that
the
local
train
had
been
stationary
in
king's
langley
station
when
the
express
going
at
fifty
miles
an
hour
had
flashed
past
it
so
perished
the
only
satisfying
explanation
and
five
years
have
elapsed
without
supplying
a
new
one
now
at
last
there
comes
a
statement
which
covers
all
the
facts
and
which
must
be
regarded
as
authentic
it
took
the
shape
of
a
letter
dated
from
new
york
and
addressed
to
the
same
criminal
investigator
whose
theory
i
have
quoted
it
is
given
here
in
extenso
with
the
exception
of
the
two
opening
paragraphs
which
are
personal
in
their
nature
you'll
excuse
me
if
i'm
not
very
free
with
names
there's
less
reason
now
than
there
was
five
years
ago
when
mother
was
still
living
but
for
all
that
i
had
rather
cover
up
our
tracks
all
i
can
but
i
owe
you
an
explanation
for
if
your
idea
of
it
was
wrong
it
was
a
mighty
ingenious
one
all
the
same
i'll
have
to
go
back
a
little
so
as
you
may
understand
all
about
it
my
people
came
from
bucks
england
and
emigrated
to
the
states
in
the
early
fifties
they
settled
in
rochester
in
the
state
of
new
york
where
my
father
ran
a
large
dry
goods
store
there
were
only
two
sons
myself
james
and
my
brother
edward
i
was
ten
years
older
than
my
brother
and
after
my
father
died
i
sort
of
took
the
place
of
a
father
to
him
as
an
elder
brother
would
he
was
a
bright
spirited
boy
and
just
one
of
the
most
beautiful
creatures
that
ever
lived
but
there
was
always
a
soft
spot
in
him
and
it
was
like
mould
in
cheese
for
it
spread
and
spread
and
nothing
that
you
could
do
would
stop
it
mother
saw
it
just
as
clearly
as
i
did
but
she
went
on
spoiling
him
all
the
same
for
he
had
such
a
way
with
him
that
you
could
refuse
him
nothing
i
did
all
i
could
to
hold
him
in
and
he
hated
me
for
my
pains
at
last
he
fairly
got
his
head
and
nothing
that
we
could
do
would
stop
him
he
got
off
into
new
york
and
went
rapidly
from
bad
to
worse
at
first
he
was
only
fast
and
then
he
was
criminal
and
then
at
the
end
of
a
year
or
two
he
was
one
of
the
most
notorious
young
crooks
in
the
city
he
had
formed
a
friendship
with
sparrow
maccoy
who
was
at
the
head
of
his
profession
as
a
bunco-steerer
green
goodsman
and
general
rascal
they
took
to
card-sharping
and
frequented
some
of
the
best
hotels
in
new
york
my
brother
was
an
excellent
actor
he
might
have
made
an
honest
name
for
himself
if
he
had
chosen
and
he
would
take
the
parts
of
a
young
englishman
of
title
of
a
simple
lad
from
the
west
or
of
a
college
undergraduate
whichever
suited
sparrow
maccoy's
purpose
and
then
one
day
he
dressed
himself
as
a
girl
and
he
carried
it
off
so
well
and
made
himself
such
a
valuable
decoy
that
it
was
their
favourite
game
afterwards
they
had
made
it
right
with
tammany
and
with
the
police
so
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
could
ever
stop
them
for
those
were
in
the
days
before
the
lexow
commission
and
if
you
only
had
a
pull
you
could
do
pretty
nearly
everything
you
wanted
and
nothing
would
have
stopped
them
if
they
had
only
stuck
to
cards
and
new
york
but
they
must
needs
come
up
rochester
way
and
forge
a
name
upon
a
cheque
it
was
my
brother
that
did
it
though
everyone
knew
that
it
was
under
the
influence
of
sparrow
maccoy
i
bought
up
that
cheque
and
a
pretty
sum
it
cost
me
then
i
went
to
my
brother
laid
it
before
him
on
the
table
and
swore
to
him
that
i
would
prosecute
if
he
did
not
clear
out
of
the
country
at
first
he
simply
laughed
i
could
not
prosecute
he
said
without
breaking
our
mother's
heart
and
he
knew
that
i
would
not
do
that
i
made
him
understand
however
that
our
mother's
heart
was
being
broken
in
any
case
and
that
i
had
set
firm
on
the
point
that
i
would
rather
see
him
in
rochester
gaol
than
in
a
new
york
hotel
so
at
last
he
gave
in
and
he
made
me
a
solemn
promise
that
he
would
see
sparrow
maccoy
no
more
that
he
would
go
to
europe
and
that
he
would
turn
his
hand
to
any
honest
trade
that
i
helped
him
to
get
i
took
him
down
right
away
to
an
old
family
friend
joe
willson
who
is
an
exporter
of
american
watches
and
clocks
and
i
got
him
to
give
edward
an
agency
in
london
with
a
small
salary
and
a
15
per
cent
commission
on
all
business
his
manner
and
appearance
were
so
good
that
he
won
the
old
man
over
at
once
and
within
a
week
he
was
sent
off
to
london
with
a
case
full
of
samples
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
business
of
the
cheque
had
really
given
my
brother
a
fright
and
that
there
was
some
chance
of
his
settling
down
into
an
honest
line
of
life
my
mother
had
spoken
with
him
and
what
she
said
had
touched
him
for
she
had
always
been
the
best
of
mothers
to
him
and
he
had
been
the
great
sorrow
of
her
life
but
i
knew
that
this
man
sparrow
maccoy
had
a
great
influence
over
edward
and
my
chance
of
keeping
the
lad
straight
lay
in
breaking
the
connection
between
them
i
had
a
friend
in
the
new
york
detective
force
and
through
him
i
kept
a
watch
upon
maccoy
when
within
a
fortnight
of
my
brother's
sailing
i
heard
that
maccoy
had
taken
a
berth
in
the
etruria
i
was
as
certain
as
if
he
had
told
me
that
he
was
going
over
to
england
for
the
purpose
of
coaxing
edward
back
again
into
the
ways
that
he
had
left
in
an
instant
i
had
resolved
to
go
also
and
to
pit
my
influence
against
maccoy's
i
knew
it
was
a
losing
fight
but
i
thought
and
my
mother
thought
that
it
was
my
duty
we
passed
the
last
night
together
in
prayer
for
my
success
and
she
gave
me
her
own
testament
that
my
father
had
given
her
on
the
day
of
their
marriage
in
the
old
country
so
that
i
might
always
wear
it
next
my
heart
i
was
a
fellow-traveller
on
the
steamship
with
sparrow
maccoy
and
at
least
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
spoiling
his
little
game
for
the
voyage
the
very
first
night
i
went
into
the
smoking-room
and
found
him
at
the
head
of
a
card-table
with
a
half
a
dozen
young
fellows
who
were
carrying
their
full
purses
and
their
empty
skulls
over
to
europe
he
was
settling
down
for
his
harvest
and
a
rich
one
it
would
have
been
but
i
soon
changed
all
that
'gentlemen'
said
i
'are
you
aware
whom
you
are
playing
with'
'what's
that
to
you
you
mind
your
own
business'
said
he
with
an
oath
'who
is
it
anyway'
asked
one
of
the
dudes
'he's
sparrow
maccoy
the
most
notorious
card-sharper
in
the
states'
up
he
jumped
with
a
bottle
in
his
hand
but
he
remembered
that
he
was
under
the
flag
of
the
effete
old
country
where
law
and
order
run
and
tammany
has
no
pull
gaol
and
the
gallows
wait
for
violence
and
murder
and
there's
no
slipping
out
by
the
back
door
on
board
an
ocean
liner
'prove
your
words
you----'
said
he
'i
will'
said
i
'if
you
will
turn
up
your
right
shirt-sleeve
to
the
shoulder
i
will
either
prove
my
words
or
i
will
eat
them'
he
turned
white
and
said
not
a
word
you
see
i
knew
something
of
his
ways
and
i
was
aware
of
that
part
of
the
mechanism
which
he
and
all
such
sharpers
use
consists
of
an
elastic
down
the
arm
with
a
clip
just
above
the
wrist
it
is
by
means
of
this
clip
that
they
withdraw
from
their
hands
the
cards
which
they
do
not
want
while
they
substitute
other
cards
from
another
hiding
place
i
reckoned
on
it
being
there
and
it
was
he
cursed
me
slunk
out
of
the
saloon
and
was
hardly
seen
again
during
the
voyage
for
once
at
any
rate
i
got
level
with
mister
sparrow
maccoy
but
he
soon
had
his
revenge
upon
me
for
when
it
came
to
influencing
my
brother
he
outweighed
me
every
time
edward
had
kept
himself
straight
in
london
for
the
first
few
weeks
and
had
done
some
business
with
his
american
watches
until
this
villain
came
across
his
path
once
more
i
did
my
best
but
the
best
was
little
enough
the
next
thing
i
heard
there
had
been
a
scandal
at
one
of
the
northumberland
avenue
hotels
a
traveller
had
been
fleeced
of
a
large
sum
by
two
confederate
card-sharpers
and
the
matter
was
in
the
hands
of
scotland
yard
the
first
i
learned
of
it
was
in
the
evening
paper
and
i
was
at
once
certain
that
my
brother
and
maccoy
were
back
at
their
old
games
i
hurried
at
once
to
edward's
lodgings
they
told
me
that
he
and
a
tall
gentleman
whom
i
recognized
as
maccoy
had
gone
off
together
and
that
he
had
left
the
lodgings
and
taken
his
things
with
him
the
landlady
had
heard
them
give
several
directions
to
the
cabman
ending
with
euston
station
and
she
had
accidentally
overheard
the
tall
gentleman
saying
something
about
manchester
she
believed
that
that
was
their
destination
a
glance
at
the
time-table
showed
me
that
the
most
likely
train
was
at
five
though
there
was
another
at
435
which
they
might
have
caught
i
had
only
time
to
get
the
later
one
but
found
no
sign
of
them
either
at
the
depot
or
in
the
train
they
must
have
gone
on
by
the
earlier
one
so
i
determined
to
follow
them
to
manchester
and
search
for
them
in
the
hotels
there
one
last
appeal
to
my
brother
by
all
that
he
owed
to
my
mother
might
even
now
be
the
salvation
of
him
my
nerves
were
overstrung
and
i
lit
a
cigar
to
steady
them
at
that
moment
just
as
the
train
was
moving
off
the
door
of
my
compartment
was
flung
open
and
there
were
maccoy
and
my
brother
on
the
platform
they
were
both
disguised
and
with
good
reason
for
they
knew
that
the
london
police
were
after
them
maccoy
had
a
great
astrakhan
collar
drawn
up
so
that
only
his
eyes
and
nose
were
showing
my
brother
was
dressed
like
a
woman
with
a
black
veil
half
down
his
face
but
of
course
it
did
not
deceive
me
for
an
instant
nor
would
it
have
done
so
even
if
i
had
not
known
that
he
had
often
used
such
a
dress
before
i
started
up
and
as
i
did
so
maccoy
recognized
me
he
said
something
the
conductor
slammed
the
door
and
they
were
shown
into
the
next
compartment
i
tried
to
stop
the
train
so
as
to
follow
them
but
the
wheels
were
already
moving
and
it
was
too
late
when
we
stopped
at
willesden
i
instantly
changed
my
carriage
it
appears
that
i
was
not
seen
to
do
so
which
is
not
surprising
as
the
station
was
crowded
with
people
maccoy
of
course
was
expecting
me
and
he
had
spent
the
time
between
euston
and
willesden
in
saying
all
he
could
to
harden
my
brother's
heart
and
set
him
against
me
that
is
what
i
fancy
for
i
had
never
found
him
so
impossible
to
soften
or
to
move
i
tried
this
way
and
i
tried
that
i
pictured
his
future
in
an
english
gaol
i
described
the
sorrow
of
his
mother
when
i
came
back
with
the
news
i
said
everything
to
touch
his
heart
but
all
to
no
purpose
he
sat
there
with
a
fixed
sneer
upon
his
handsome
face
while
every
now
and
then
sparrow
maccoy
would
throw
in
a
taunt
at
me
or
some
word
of
encouragement
to
hold
my
brother
to
his
resolutions
'why
don't
you
run
a
sunday-school'
he
would
say
to
me
and
then
in
the
same
breath
'he
thinks
you
have
no
will
of
your
own
he
thinks
you
are
just
the
baby
brother
and
that
he
can
lead
you
where
he
likes
he's
only
just
finding
out
that
you
are
a
man
as
well
as
he'
it
was
those
words
of
his
which
set
me
talking
bitterly
we
had
left
willesden
you
understand
for
all
this
took
some
time
my
temper
got
the
better
of
me
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
let
my
brother
see
the
rough
side
of
me
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
had
i
done
so
earlier
and
more
often
'a
man'
said
i
'well
i'm
glad
to
have
your
friend's
assurance
of
it
for
no
one
would
suspect
it
to
see
you
like
a
boarding-school
missy
i
don't
suppose
in
all
this
country
there
is
a
more
contemptible-looking
creature
than
you
are
as
you
sit
there
with
that
dolly
pinafore
upon
you'
he
coloured
up
at
that
for
he
was
a
vain
man
and
he
winced
from
ridicule
'it's
only
a
dust-cloak'
said
he
and
he
slipped
it
off
'one
has
to
throw
the
coppers
off
one's
scent
and
i
had
no
other
way
to
do
it'
he
took
his
toque
off
with
the
veil
attached
and
he
put
both
it
and
the
cloak
into
his
brown
bag
'anyway
i
don't
need
to
wear
it
until
the
conductor
comes
round'
said
he
'nor
then
either'
said
i
and
taking
the
bag
i
slung
it
with
all
my
force
out
of
the
window
'now'
said
i
'you'll
never
make
a
mary
jane
of
yourself
while
i
can
help
it
if
nothing
but
that
disguise
stands
between
you
and
a
gaol
then
to
gaol
you
shall
go'
that
was
the
way
to
manage
him
i
felt
my
advantage
at
once
his
supple
nature
was
one
which
yielded
to
roughness
far
more
readily
than
to
entreaty
he
flushed
with
shame
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
maccoy
saw
my
advantage
also
and
was
determined
that
i
should
not
pursue
it
'he's
my
pard
and
you
shall
not
bully
him'
he
cried
'he's
my
brother
and
you
shall
not
ruin
him'
said
i
'i
believe
a
spell
of
prison
is
the
very
best
way
of
keeping
you
apart
and
you
shall
have
it
or
it
will
be
no
fault
of
mine'
'oh
you
would
squeal
would
you'
he
cried
and
in
an
instant
he
whipped
out
his
revolver
i
sprang
for
his
hand
but
saw
that
i
was
too
late
and
jumped
aside
at
the
same
instant
he
fired
and
the
bullet
which
would
have
struck
me
passed
through
the
heart
of
my
unfortunate
brother
he
dropped
without
a
groan
upon
the
floor
of
the
compartment
and
maccoy
and
i
equally
horrified
knelt
at
each
side
of
him
trying
to
bring
back
some
signs
of
life
maccoy
still
held
the
loaded
revolver
in
his
hand
but
his
anger
against
me
and
my
resentment
towards
him
had
both
for
the
moment
been
swallowed
up
in
this
sudden
tragedy
it
was
he
who
first
realized
the
situation
the
train
was
for
some
reason
going
very
slowly
at
the
moment
and
he
saw
his
opportunity
for
escape
in
an
instant
he
had
the
door
open
but
i
was
as
quick
as
he
and
jumping
upon
him
the
two
of
us
fell
off
the
footboard
and
rolled
in
each
other's
arms
down
a
steep
embankment
at
the
bottom
i
struck
my
head
against
a
stone
and
i
remembered
nothing
more
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
lying
among
some
low
bushes
not
far
from
the
railroad
track
and
somebody
was
bathing
my
head
with
a
wet
handkerchief
it
was
sparrow
maccoy
'i
guess
i
couldn't
leave
you'
said
he
'i
didn't
want
to
have
the
blood
of
two
of
you
on
my
hands
in
one
day
you
loved
your
brother
i've
no
doubt
but
you
didn't
love
him
a
cent
more
than
i
loved
him
though
you'll
say
that
i
took
a
queer
way
to
show
it
anyhow
it
seems
a
mighty
empty
world
now
that
he
is
gone
and
i
don't
care
a
continental
whether
you
give
me
over
to
the
hangman
or
not'
he
had
turned
his
ankle
in
the
fall
and
there
we
sat
he
with
his
useless
foot
and
i
with
my
throbbing
head
and
we
talked
and
talked
until
gradually
my
bitterness
began
to
soften
and
to
turn
into
something
like
sympathy
what
was
the
use
of
revenging
his
death
upon
a
man
who
was
as
much
stricken
by
that
death
as
i
was
and
then
as
my
wits
gradually
returned
i
began
to
realize
also
that
i
could
do
nothing
against
maccoy
which
would
not
recoil
upon
my
mother
and
myself
how
could
we
convict
him
without
a
full
account
of
my
brother's
career
being
made
public--the
very
thing
which
of
all
others
we
wished
to
avoid
it
was
really
as
much
our
interest
as
his
to
cover
the
matter
up
and
from
being
an
avenger
of
crime
i
found
myself
changed
to
a
conspirator
against
justice
the
place
in
which
we
found
ourselves
was
one
of
those
pheasant
preserves
which
are
so
common
in
the
old
country
and
as
we
groped
our
way
through
it
i
found
myself
consulting
the
slayer
of
my
brother
as
to
how
far
it
would
be
possible
to
hush
it
up
i
soon
realized
from
what
he
said
that
unless
there
were
some
papers
of
which
we
knew
nothing
in
my
brother's
pockets
there
was
really
no
possible
means
by
which
the
police
could
identify
him
or
learn
how
he
had
got
there
his
ticket
was
in
maccoy's
pocket
and
so
was
the
ticket
for
some
baggage
which
they
had
left
at
the
depot
like
most
americans
he
had
found
it
cheaper
and
easier
to
buy
an
outfit
in
london
than
to
bring
one
from
new
york
so
that
all
his
linen
and
clothes
were
new
and
unmarked
the
bag
containing
the
dust-cloak
which
i
had
thrown
out
of
the
window
may
have
fallen
among
some
bramble
patch
where
it
is
still
concealed
or
may
have
been
carried
off
by
some
tramp
or
may
have
come
into
the
possession
of
the
police
who
kept
the
incident
to
themselves
anyhow
i
have
seen
nothing
about
it
in
the
london
papers
as
to
the
watches
they
were
a
selection
from
those
which
had
been
intrusted
to
him
for
business
purposes
it
may
have
been
for
the
same
business
purposes
that
he
was
taking
them
to
manchester
but--well
it's
too
late
to
enter
into
that
i
don't
blame
the
police
for
being
at
fault
i
don't
see
how
it
could
have
been
otherwise
there
was
just
one
little
clue
that
they
might
have
followed
up
but
it
was
a
small
one
i
mean
that
small
circular
mirror
which
was
found
in
my
brother's
pocket
it
isn't
a
very
common
thing
for
a
young
man
to
carry
about
with
him
is
it
but
a
gambler
might
have
told
you
what
such
a
mirror
may
mean
to
a
card-sharper
if
you
sit
back
a
little
from
the
table
and
lay
the
mirror
face
upwards
upon
your
lap
you
can
see
as
you
deal
every
card
that
you
give
to
your
adversary
it
is
not
hard
to
say
whether
you
see
a
man
or
raise
him
when
you
know
his
cards
as
well
as
your
own
it
was
as
much
a
part
of
a
sharper's
outfit
as
the
elastic
clip
upon
sparrow
maccoy's
arm
taking
that
in
connection
with
the
recent
frauds
at
the
hotels
the
police
might
have
got
hold
of
one
end
of
the
string
i
don't
think
there
is
much
more
for
me
to
explain
we
got
to
a
village
called
amersham
that
night
in
the
character
of
two
gentlemen
upon
a
walking
tour
and
afterwards
we
made
our
way
quietly
to
london
whence
maccoy
went
on
to
cairo
and
i
returned
to
new
york
my
mother
died
six
months
afterwards
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
to
the
day
of
her
death
she
never
knew
what
happened
she
was
always
under
the
delusion
that
edward
was
earning
an
honest
living
in
london
and
i
never
had
the
heart
to
tell
her
the
truth
he
never
wrote
but
then
he
never
did
write
at
any
time
so
that
made
no
difference
his
name
was
the
last
upon
her
lips
there's
just
one
other
thing
that
i
have
to
ask
you
sir
and
i
should
take
it
as
a
kind
return
for
all
this
explanation
if
you
could
do
it
for
me
you
remember
that
testament
that
was
picked
up
i
always
carried
it
in
my
inside
pocket
and
it
must
have
come
out
in
my
fall
i
value
it
very
highly
for
it
was
the
family
book
with
my
birth
and
my
brother's
marked
by
my
father
in
the
beginning
of
it
i
wish
you
would
apply
at
the
proper
place
and
have
it
sent
to
me
it
can
be
of
no
possible
value
to
anyone
else
if
you
address
it
to
x
bassano's
library
broadway
new
york
it
is
sure
to
come
to
hand
the
japanned
box
it
was
a
curious
thing
said
the
private
tutor
one
of
those
grotesque
and
whimsical
incidents
which
occur
to
one
as
one
goes
through
life
i
lost
the
best
situation
which
i
am
ever
likely
to
have
through
it
but
i
am
glad
that
i
went
to
thorpe
place
for
i
gained--well
as
i
tell
you
the
story
you
will
learn
what
i
gained
i
don't
know
whether
you
are
familiar
with
that
part
of
the
midlands
which
is
drained
by
the
avon
it
is
the
most
english
part
of
england
shakespeare
the
flower
of
the
whole
race
was
born
right
in
the
middle
of
it
it
is
a
land
of
rolling
pastures
rising
in
higher
folds
to
the
westwards
until
they
swell
into
the
malvern
hills
there
are
no
towns
but
numerous
villages
each
with
its
grey
norman
church
you
have
left
the
brick
of
the
southern
and
eastern
counties
behind
you
and
everything
is
stone--stone
for
the
walls
and
lichened
slabs
of
stone
for
the
roofs
it
is
all
grim
and
solid
and
massive
as
befits
the
heart
of
a
great
nation
it
was
in
the
middle
of
this
country
not
very
far
from
evesham
that
sir
john
bollamore
lived
in
the
old
ancestral
home
of
thorpe
place
and
thither
it
was
that
i
came
to
teach
his
two
little
sons
sir
john
was
a
widower--his
wife
had
died
three
years
before--and
he
had
been
left
with
these
two
lads
aged
eight
and
ten
and
one
dear
little
girl
of
seven
miss
witherton
who
is
now
my
wife
was
governess
to
this
little
girl
i
was
tutor
to
the
two
boys
could
there
be
a
more
obvious
prelude
to
an
engagement
she
governs
me
now
and
i
tutor
two
little
boys
of
our
own
but
there--i
have
already
revealed
what
it
was
which
i
gained
in
thorpe
place
it
was
a
very
very
old
house
incredibly
old--pre-norman
some
of
it--and
the
bollamores
claimed
to
have
lived
in
that
situation
since
long
before
the
conquest
it
struck
a
chill
to
my
heart
when
first
i
came
there
those
enormously
thick
grey
walls
the
rude
crumbling
stones
the
smell
as
from
a
sick
animal
which
exhaled
from
the
rotting
plaster
of
the
aged
building
but
the
modern
wing
was
bright
and
the
garden
was
well
kept
no
house
could
be
dismal
which
had
a
pretty
girl
inside
it
and
such
a
show
of
roses
in
front
apart
from
a
very
complete
staff
of
servants
there
were
only
four
of
us
in
the
household
these
were
miss
witherton
who
was
at
that
time
four-and-twenty
and
as
pretty--well
as
pretty
as
mrs
colmore
is
now--myself
frank
colmore
aged
thirty
mrs
stevens
the
housekeeper
a
dry
silent
woman
and
mr
richards
a
tall
military-looking
man
who
acted
as
steward
to
the
bollamore
estates
we
four
always
had
our
meals
together
but
sir
john
had
his
usually
alone
in
the
library
sometimes
he
joined
us
at
dinner
but
on
the
whole
we
were
just
as
glad
when
he
did
not
for
he
was
a
very
formidable
person
imagine
a
man
six
feet
three
inches
in
height
majestically
built
with
a
high-nosed
aristocratic
face
brindled
hair
shaggy
eyebrows
a
small
pointed
mephistophelian
beard
and
lines
upon
his
brow
and
round
his
eyes
as
deep
as
if
they
had
been
carved
with
a
penknife
he
had
grey
eyes
weary
hopeless-looking
eyes
proud
and
yet
pathetic
eyes
which
claimed
your
pity
and
yet
dared
you
to
show
it
his
back
was
rounded
with
study
but
otherwise
he
was
as
fine
a
looking
man
of
his
age--five-and-fifty
perhaps--as
any
woman
would
wish
to
look
upon
but
his
presence
was
not
a
cheerful
one
he
was
always
courteous
always
refined
but
singularly
silent
and
retiring
i
have
never
lived
so
long
with
any
man
and
known
so
little
of
him
if
he
were
indoors
he
spent
his
time
either
in
his
own
small
study
in
the
eastern
tower
or
in
the
library
in
the
modern
wing
so
regular
was
his
routine
that
one
could
always
say
at
any
hour
exactly
where
he
would
be
twice
in
the
day
he
would
visit
his
study
once
after
breakfast
and
once
about
ten
at
night
you
might
set
your
watch
by
the
slam
of
the
heavy
door
for
the
rest
of
the
day
he
would
be
in
his
library--save
that
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
afternoon
he
would
take
a
walk
or
a
ride
which
was
solitary
like
the
rest
of
his
existence
he
loved
his
children
and
was
keenly
interested
in
the
progress
of
their
studies
but
they
were
a
little
awed
by
the
silent
shaggy-browed
figure
and
they
avoided
him
as
much
as
they
could
indeed
we
all
did
that
it
was
some
time
before
i
came
to
know
anything
about
the
circumstances
of
sir
john
bollamore's
life
for
mrs
stevens
the
housekeeper
and
mr
richards
the
land-steward
were
too
loyal
to
talk
easily
of
their
employer's
affairs
as
to
the
governess
she
knew
no
more
than
i
did
and
our
common
interest
was
one
of
the
causes
which
drew
us
together
at
last
however
an
incident
occurred
which
led
to
a
closer
acquaintance
with
mr
richards
and
a
fuller
knowledge
of
the
life
of
the
man
whom
i
served
the
immediate
cause
of
this
was
no
less
than
the
falling
of
master
percy
the
youngest
of
my
pupils
into
the
mill-race
with
imminent
danger
both
to
his
life
and
to
mine
since
i
had
to
risk
myself
in
order
to
save
him
dripping
and
exhausted--for
i
was
far
more
spent
than
the
child--i
was
making
for
my
room
when
sir
john
who
had
heard
the
hubbub
opened
the
door
of
his
little
study
and
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
i
told
him
of
the
accident
but
assured
him
that
his
child
was
in
no
danger
while
he
listened
with
a
rugged
immobile
face
which
expressed
in
its
intense
eyes
and
tightened
lips
all
the
emotion
which
he
tried
to
conceal
one
moment
step
in
here
let
me
have
the
details
said
he
turning
back
through
the
open
door
and
so
i
found
myself
within
that
little
sanctum
inside
which
as
i
afterwards
learned
no
other
foot
had
for
three
years
been
set
save
that
of
the
old
servant
who
cleaned
it
out
it
was
a
round
room
conforming
to
the
shape
of
the
tower
in
which
it
was
situated
with
a
low
ceiling
a
single
narrow
ivy-wreathed
window
and
the
simplest
of
furniture
an
old
carpet
a
single
chair
a
deal
table
and
a
small
shelf
of
books
made
up
the
whole
contents
on
the
table
stood
a
full-length
photograph
of
a
woman--i
took
no
particular
notice
of
the
features
but
i
remember
that
a
certain
gracious
gentleness
was
the
prevailing
impression
beside
it
were
a
large
black
japanned
box
and
one
or
two
bundles
of
letters
or
papers
fastened
together
with
elastic
bands
our
interview
was
a
short
one
for
sir
john
bollamore
perceived
that
i
was
soaked
and
that
i
should
change
without
delay
the
incident
led
however
to
an
instructive
talk
with
richards
the
agent
who
had
never
penetrated
into
the
chamber
which
chance
had
opened
to
me
that
very
afternoon
he
came
to
me
all
curiosity
and
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
path
with
me
while
my
two
charges
played
tennis
upon
the
lawn
beside
us
you
hardly
realize
the
exception
which
has
been
made
in
your
favour
said
he
that
room
has
been
kept
such
a
mystery
and
sir
john's
visits
to
it
have
been
so
regular
and
consistent
that
an
almost
superstitious
feeling
has
arisen
about
it
in
the
household
i
assure
you
that
if
i
were
to
repeat
to
you
the
tales
which
are
flying
about
tales
of
mysterious
visitors
there
and
of
voices
overheard
by
the
servants
you
might
suspect
that
sir
john
had
relapsed
into
his
old
ways
why
do
you
say
relapsed
i
asked
he
looked
at
me
in
surprise
is
it
possible
said
he
that
sir
john
bollamore's
previous
history
is
unknown
to
you
absolutely
you
astound
me
i
thought
that
every
man
in
england
knew
something
of
his
antecedents
i
should
not
mention
the
matter
if
it
were
not
that
you
are
now
one
of
ourselves
and
that
the
facts
might
come
to
your
ears
in
some
harsher
form
if
i
were
silent
upon
them
i
always
took
it
for
granted
that
you
knew
that
you
were
in
the
service
of
'devil'
bollamore
but
why
'devil'
i
asked
ah
you
are
young
and
the
world
moves
fast
but
twenty
years
ago
the
name
of
'devil'
bollamore
was
one
of
the
best
known
in
london
he
was
the
leader
of
the
fastest
set
bruiser
driver
gambler
drunkard--a
survival
of
the
old
type
and
as
bad
as
the
worst
of
them
i
stared
at
him
in
amazement
what
i
cried
that
quiet
studious
sad-faced
man
the
greatest
rip
and
debauchee
in
england
all
between
ourselves
colmore
but
you
understand
now
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
a
woman's
voice
in
his
room
might
even
now
give
rise
to
suspicions
but
what
can
have
changed
him
so
little
beryl
clare
when
she
took
the
risk
of
becoming
his
wife
that
was
the
turning
point
he
had
got
so
far
that
his
own
fast
set
had
thrown
him
over
there
is
a
world
of
difference
you
know
between
a
man
who
drinks
and
a
drunkard
they
all
drink
but
they
taboo
a
drunkard
he
had
become
a
slave
to
it--hopeless
and
helpless
then
she
stepped
in
saw
the
possibilities
of
a
fine
man
in
the
wreck
took
her
chance
in
marrying
him
though
she
might
have
had
the
pick
of
a
dozen
and
by
devoting
her
life
to
it
brought
him
back
to
manhood
and
decency
you
have
observed
that
no
liquor
is
ever
kept
in
the
house
there
never
has
been
any
since
her
foot
crossed
its
threshold
a
drop
of
it
would
be
like
blood
to
a
tiger
even
now
then
her
influence
still
holds
him
that
is
the
wonder
of
it
when
she
died
three
years
ago
we
all
expected
and
feared
that
he
would
fall
back
into
his
old
ways
she
feared
it
herself
and
the
thought
gave
a
terror
to
death
for
she
was
like
a
guardian
angel
to
that
man
and
lived
only
for
the
one
purpose
by
the
way
did
you
see
a
black
japanned
box
in
his
room
yes
i
fancy
it
contains
her
letters
if
ever
he
has
occasion
to
be
away
if
only
for
a
single
night
he
invariably
takes
his
black
japanned
box
with
him
well
well
colmore
perhaps
i
have
told
you
rather
more
than
i
should
but
i
shall
expect
you
to
reciprocate
if
anything
of
interest
should
come
to
your
knowledge
i
could
see
that
the
worthy
man
was
consumed
with
curiosity
and
just
a
little
piqued
that
i
the
newcomer
should
have
been
the
first
to
penetrate
into
the
untrodden
chamber
but
the
fact
raised
me
in
his
esteem
and
from
that
time
onwards
i
found
myself
upon
more
confidential
terms
with
him
and
now
the
silent
and
majestic
figure
of
my
employer
became
an
object
of
greater
interest
to
me
i
began
to
understand
that
strangely
human
look
in
his
eyes
those
deep
lines
upon
his
care-worn
face
he
was
a
man
who
was
fighting
a
ceaseless
battle
holding
at
arm's
length
from
morning
till
night
a
horrible
adversary
who
was
forever
trying
to
close
with
him--an
adversary
which
would
destroy
him
body
and
soul
could
it
but
fix
its
claws
once
more
upon
him
as
i
watched
the
grim
round-backed
figure
pacing
the
corridor
or
walking
in
the
garden
this
imminent
danger
seemed
to
take
bodily
shape
and
i
could
almost
fancy
that
i
saw
this
most
loathsome
and
dangerous
of
all
the
fiends
crouching
closely
in
his
very
shadow
like
a
half-cowed
beast
which
slinks
beside
its
keeper
ready
at
any
unguarded
moment
to
spring
at
his
throat
and
the
dead
woman
the
woman
who
had
spent
her
life
in
warding
off
this
danger
took
shape
also
to
my
imagination
and
i
saw
her
as
a
shadowy
but
beautiful
presence
which
intervened
for
ever
with
arms
uplifted
to
screen
the
man
whom
she
loved
in
some
subtle
way
he
divined
the
sympathy
which
i
had
for
him
and
he
showed
in
his
own
silent
fashion
that
he
appreciated
it
he
even
invited
me
once
to
share
his
afternoon
walk
and
although
no
word
passed
between
us
on
this
occasion
it
was
a
mark
of
confidence
which
he
had
never
shown
to
anyone
before
he
asked
me
also
to
index
his
library
it
was
one
of
the
best
private
libraries
in
england
and
i
spent
many
hours
in
the
evening
in
his
presence
if
not
in
his
society
he
reading
at
his
desk
and
i
sitting
in
a
recess
by
the
window
reducing
to
order
the
chaos
which
existed
among
his
books
in
spite
of
these
close
relations
i
was
never
again
asked
to
enter
the
chamber
in
the
turret
and
then
came
my
revulsion
of
feeling
a
single
incident
changed
all
my
sympathy
to
loathing
and
made
me
realize
that
my
employer
still
remained
all
that
he
had
ever
been
with
the
additional
vice
of
hypocrisy
what
happened
was
as
follows
one
evening
miss
witherton
had
gone
down
to
broadway
the
neighbouring
village
to
sing
at
a
concert
for
some
charity
and
i
according
to
my
promise
had
walked
over
to
escort
her
back
the
drive
sweeps
round
under
the
eastern
turret
and
i
observed
as
i
passed
that
the
light
was
lit
in
the
circular
room
it
was
a
summer
evening
and
the
window
which
was
a
little
higher
than
our
heads
was
open
we
were
as
it
happened
engrossed
in
our
own
conversation
at
the
moment
and
we
had
paused
upon
the
lawn
which
skirts
the
old
turret
when
suddenly
something
broke
in
upon
our
talk
and
turned
our
thoughts
away
from
our
own
affairs
it
was
a
voice--the
voice
undoubtedly
of
a
woman
it
was
low--so
low
that
it
was
only
in
that
still
night
air
that
we
could
have
heard
it
but
hushed
as
it
was
there
was
no
mistaking
its
feminine
timbre
it
spoke
hurriedly
gaspingly
for
a
few
sentences
and
then
was
silent--a
piteous
breathless
imploring
sort
of
voice
miss
witherton
and
i
stood
for
an
instant
staring
at
each
other
then
we
walked
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
hall-door
it
came
through
the
window
i
said
we
must
not
play
the
part
of
eavesdroppers
she
answered
we
must
forget
that
we
have
ever
heard
it
there
was
an
absence
of
surprise
in
her
manner
which
suggested
a
new
idea
to
me
you
have
heard
it
before
i
cried
i
could
not
help
it
my
own
room
is
higher
up
on
the
same
turret
it
has
happened
frequently
who
can
the
woman
be
i
have
no
idea
i
had
rather
not
discuss
it
her
voice
was
enough
to
show
me
what
she
thought
but
granting
that
our
employer
led
a
double
and
dubious
life
who
could
she
be
this
mysterious
woman
who
kept
him
company
in
the
old
tower
i
knew
from
my
own
inspection
how
bleak
and
bare
a
room
it
was
she
certainly
did
not
live
there
but
in
that
case
where
did
she
come
from
it
could
not
be
anyone
of
the
household
they
were
all
under
the
vigilant
eyes
of
mrs
stevens
the
visitor
must
come
from
without
but
how
and
then
suddenly
i
remembered
how
ancient
this
building
was
and
how
probable
that
some
mediaeval
passage
existed
in
it
there
is
hardly
an
old
castle
without
one
the
mysterious
room
was
the
basement
of
the
turret
so
that
if
there
were
anything
of
the
sort
it
would
open
through
the
floor
there
were
numerous
cottages
in
the
immediate
vicinity
the
other
end
of
the
secret
passage
might
lie
among
some
tangle
of
bramble
in
the
neighbouring
copse
i
said
nothing
to
anyone
but
i
felt
that
the
secret
of
my
employer
lay
within
my
power
and
the
more
convinced
i
was
of
this
the
more
i
marvelled
at
the
manner
in
which
he
concealed
his
true
nature
often
as
i
watched
his
austere
figure
i
asked
myself
if
it
were
indeed
possible
that
such
a
man
should
be
living
this
double
life
and
i
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
my
suspicions
might
after
all
prove
to
be
ill-founded
but
there
was
the
female
voice
there
was
the
secret
nightly
rendezvous
in
the
turret-chamber--how
could
such
facts
admit
of
an
innocent
interpretation
i
conceived
a
horror
of
the
man
i
was
filled
with
loathing
at
his
deep
consistent
hypocrisy
only
once
during
all
those
months
did
i
ever
see
him
without
that
sad
but
impassive
mask
which
he
usually
presented
towards
his
fellow-man
for
an
instant
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
those
volcanic
fires
which
he
had
damped
down
so
long
the
occasion
was
an
unworthy
one
for
the
object
of
his
wrath
was
none
other
than
the
aged
charwoman
whom
i
have
already
mentioned
as
being
the
one
person
who
was
allowed
within
his
mysterious
chamber
i
was
passing
the
corridor
which
led
to
the
turret--for
my
own
room
lay
in
that
direction--when
i
heard
a
sudden
startled
scream
and
merged
in
it
the
husky
growling
note
of
a
man
who
is
inarticulate
with
passion
it
was
the
snarl
of
a
furious
wild
beast
then
i
heard
his
voice
thrilling
with
anger
you
would
dare
he
cried
you
would
dare
to
disobey
my
directions
an
instant
later
the
charwoman
passed
me
flying
down
the
passage
white-faced
and
tremulous
while
the
terrible
voice
thundered
behind
her
go
to
mrs
stevens
for
your
money
never
set
foot
in
thorpe
place
again
consumed
with
curiosity
i
could
not
help
following
the
woman
and
found
her
round
the
corner
leaning
against
the
wall
and
palpitating
like
a
frightened
rabbit
what
is
the
matter
mrs
brown
i
asked
it's
master
she
gasped
oh
'ow
'e
frightened
me
if
you
had
seen
'is
eyes
mr
colmore
sir
i
thought
'e
would
'ave
been
the
death
of
me
but
what
had
you
done
done
sir
nothing
at
least
nothing
to
make
so
much
of
just
laid
my
'and
on
that
black
box
of
'is--'adn't
even
opened
it
when
in
'e
came
and
you
'eard
the
way
'e
went
on
i've
lost
my
place
and
glad
i
am
of
it
for
i
would
never
trust
myself
within
reach
of
'im
again
so
it
was
the
japanned
box
which
was
the
cause
of
this
outburst--the
box
from
which
he
would
never
permit
himself
to
be
separated
what
was
the
connection
or
was
there
any
connection
between
this
and
the
secret
visits
of
the
lady
whose
voice
i
had
overheard
sir
john
bollamore's
wrath
was
enduring
as
well
as
fiery
for
from
that
day
mrs
brown
the
charwoman
vanished
from
our
ken
and
thorpe
place
knew
her
no
more
and
now
i
wish
to
tell
you
the
singular
chance
which
solved
all
these
strange
questions
and
put
my
employer's
secret
in
my
possession
the
story
may
leave
you
with
some
lingering
doubts
as
to
whether
my
curiosity
did
not
get
the
better
of
my
honour
and
whether
i
did
not
condescend
to
play
the
spy
if
you
choose
to
think
so
i
cannot
help
it
but
can
only
assure
you
that
improbable
as
it
may
appear
the
matter
came
about
exactly
as
i
describe
it
the
first
stage
in
this
denouement
was
that
the
small
room
in
the
turret
became
uninhabitable
this
occurred
through
the
fall
of
the
worm-eaten
oaken
beam
which
supported
the
ceiling
rotten
with
age
it
snapped
in
the
middle
one
morning
and
brought
down
a
quantity
of
plaster
with
it
fortunately
sir
john
was
not
in
the
room
at
the
time
his
precious
box
was
rescued
from
amongst
the
debris
and
brought
into
the
library
where
henceforward
it
was
locked
within
his
bureau
sir
john
took
no
steps
to
repair
the
damage
and
i
never
had
an
opportunity
of
searching
for
that
secret
passage
the
existence
of
which
i
had
surmised
as
to
the
lady
i
had
thought
that
this
would
have
brought
her
visits
to
an
end
had
i
not
one
evening
heard
mr
richards
asking
mrs
stevens
who
the
woman
was
whom
he
had
overheard
talking
to
sir
john
in
the
library
i
could
not
catch
her
reply
but
i
saw
from
her
manner
that
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
had
to
answer
or
avoid
the
same
question
you've
heard
the
voice
colmore
said
the
agent
i
confessed
that
i
had
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
remarked
that
it
was
no
business
of
mine
come
come
you
are
just
as
curious
as
any
of
us
is
it
a
woman
or
not
it
is
certainly
a
woman
which
room
did
you
hear
it
from
from
the
turret-room
before
the
ceiling
fell
but
i
heard
it
from
the
library
only
last
night
i
passed
the
doors
as
i
was
going
to
bed
and
i
heard
something
wailing
and
praying
just
as
plainly
as
i
hear
you
it
may
be
a
woman----
why
what
else
could
it
be
he
looked
at
me
hard
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
said
he
if
it
is
a
woman
how
does
she
get
there
i
don't
know
no
nor
i
but
if
it
is
the
other
thing--but
there
for
a
practical
business
man
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
this
is
rather
a
ridiculous
line
of
conversation
he
turned
away
but
i
saw
that
he
felt
even
more
than
he
had
said
to
all
the
old
ghost
stories
of
thorpe
place
a
new
one
was
being
added
before
our
very
eyes
it
may
by
this
time
have
taken
its
permanent
place
for
though
an
explanation
came
to
me
it
never
reached
the
others
and
my
explanation
came
in
this
way
i
had
suffered
a
sleepless
night
from
neuralgia
and
about
midday
i
had
taken
a
heavy
dose
of
chlorodyne
to
alleviate
the
pain
at
that
time
i
was
finishing
the
indexing
of
sir
john
bollamore's
library
and
it
was
my
custom
to
work
there
from
five
till
seven
on
this
particular
day
i
struggled
against
the
double
effect
of
my
bad
night
and
the
narcotic
i
have
already
mentioned
that
there
was
a
recess
in
the
library
and
in
this
it
was
my
habit
to
work
i
settled
down
steadily
to
my
task
but
my
weariness
overcame
me
and
falling
back
upon
the
settee
i
dropped
into
a
heavy
sleep
how
long
i
slept
i
do
not
know
but
it
was
quite
dark
when
i
awoke
confused
by
the
chlorodyne
which
i
had
taken
i
lay
motionless
in
a
semi-conscious
state
the
great
room
with
its
high
walls
covered
with
books
loomed
darkly
all
round
me
a
dim
radiance
from
the
moonlight
came
through
the
farther
window
and
against
this
lighter
background
i
saw
that
sir
john
bollamore
was
sitting
at
his
study
table
his
well-set
head
and
clearly
cut
profile
were
sharply
outlined
against
the
glimmering
square
behind
him
he
bent
as
i
watched
him
and
i
heard
the
sharp
turning
of
a
key
and
the
rasping
of
metal
upon
metal
as
if
in
a
dream
i
was
vaguely
conscious
that
this
was
the
japanned
box
which
stood
in
front
of
him
and
that
he
had
drawn
something
out
of
it
something
squat
and
uncouth
which
now
lay
before
him
upon
the
table
i
never
realized--it
never
occurred
to
my
bemuddled
and
torpid
brain
that
i
was
intruding
upon
his
privacy
that
he
imagined
himself
to
be
alone
in
the
room
and
then
just
as
it
rushed
upon
my
horrified
perceptions
and
i
had
half
risen
to
announce
my
presence
i
heard
a
strange
crisp
metallic
clicking
and
then
the
voice
yes
it
was
a
woman's
voice
there
could
not
be
a
doubt
of
it
but
a
voice
so
charged
with
entreaty
and
with
yearning
love
that
it
will
ring
for
ever
in
my
ears
it
came
with
a
curious
faraway
tinkle
but
every
word
was
clear
though
faint--very
faint
for
they
were
the
last
words
of
a
dying
woman
i
am
not
really
gone
john
said
the
thin
gasping
voice
i
am
here
at
your
very
elbow
and
shall
be
until
we
meet
once
more
i
die
happy
to
think
that
morning
and
night
you
will
hear
my
voice
oh
john
be
strong
be
strong
until
we
meet
again
i
say
that
i
had
risen
in
order
to
announce
my
presence
but
i
could
not
do
so
while
the
voice
was
sounding
i
could
only
remain
half
lying
half
sitting
paralysed
astounded
listening
to
those
yearning
distant
musical
words
and
he--he
was
so
absorbed
that
even
if
i
had
spoken
he
might
not
have
heard
me
but
with
the
silence
of
the
voice
came
my
half
articulated
apologies
and
explanations
he
sprang
across
the
room
switched
on
the
electric
light
and
in
its
white
glare
i
saw
him
his
eyes
gleaming
with
anger
his
face
twisted
with
passion
as
the
hapless
charwoman
may
have
seen
him
weeks
before
mr
colmore
he
cried
you
here
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
sir
with
halting
words
i
explained
it
all
my
neuralgia
the
narcotic
my
luckless
sleep
and
singular
awakening
as
he
listened
the
glow
of
anger
faded
from
his
face
and
the
sad
impassive
mask
closed
once
more
over
his
features
my
secret
is
yours
mr
colmore
said
he
i
have
only
myself
to
blame
for
relaxing
my
precautions
half
confidences
are
worse
than
no
confidences
and
so
you
may
know
all
since
you
know
so
much
the
story
may
go
where
you
will
when
i
have
passed
away
but
until
then
i
rely
upon
your
sense
of
honour
that
no
human
soul
shall
hear
it
from
your
lips
i
am
proud
still--god
help
me--or
at
least
i
am
proud
enough
to
resent
that
pity
which
this
story
would
draw
upon
me
i
have
smiled
at
envy
and
disregarded
hatred
but
pity
is
more
than
i
can
tolerate
you
have
heard
the
source
from
which
the
voice
comes--that
voice
which
has
as
i
understand
excited
so
much
curiosity
in
my
household
i
am
aware
of
the
rumours
to
which
it
has
given
rise
these
speculations
whether
scandalous
or
superstitious
are
such
as
i
can
disregard
and
forgive
what
i
should
never
forgive
would
be
a
disloyal
spying
and
eavesdropping
in
order
to
satisfy
an
illicit
curiosity
but
of
that
mr
colmore
i
acquit
you
when
i
was
a
young
man
sir
many
years
younger
than
you
are
now
i
was
launched
upon
town
without
a
friend
or
adviser
and
with
a
purse
which
brought
only
too
many
false
friends
and
false
advisers
to
my
side
i
drank
deeply
of
the
wine
of
life--if
there
is
a
man
living
who
has
drunk
more
deeply
he
is
not
a
man
whom
i
envy
my
purse
suffered
my
character
suffered
my
constitution
suffered
stimulants
became
a
necessity
to
me
i
was
a
creature
from
whom
my
memory
recoils
and
it
was
at
that
time
the
time
of
my
blackest
degradation
that
god
sent
into
my
life
the
gentlest
sweetest
spirit
that
ever
descended
as
a
ministering
angel
from
above
she
loved
me
broken
as
i
was
loved
me
and
spent
her
life
in
making
a
man
once
more
of
that
which
had
degraded
itself
to
the
level
of
the
beasts
but
a
fell
disease
struck
her
and
she
withered
away
before
my
eyes
in
the
hour
of
her
agony
it
was
never
of
herself
of
her
own
sufferings
and
her
own
death
that
she
thought
it
was
all
of
me
the
one
pang
which
her
fate
brought
to
her
was
the
fear
that
when
her
influence
was
removed
i
should
revert
to
that
which
i
had
been
it
was
in
vain
that
i
made
oath
to
her
that
no
drop
of
wine
would
ever
cross
my
lips
she
knew
only
too
well
the
hold
that
the
devil
had
upon
me--she
who
had
striven
so
to
loosen
it--and
it
haunted
her
night
and
day
the
thought
that
my
soul
might
again
be
within
his
grip
it
was
from
some
friend's
gossip
of
the
sick
room
that
she
heard
of
this
invention--this
phonograph--and
with
the
quick
insight
of
a
loving
woman
she
saw
how
she
might
use
it
for
her
ends
she
sent
me
to
london
to
procure
the
best
which
money
could
buy
with
her
dying
breath
she
gasped
into
it
the
words
which
have
held
me
straight
ever
since
lonely
and
broken
what
else
have
i
in
all
the
world
to
uphold
me
but
it
is
enough
please
god
i
shall
face
her
without
shame
when
he
is
pleased
to
reunite
us
that
is
my
secret
mr
colmore
and
whilst
i
live
i
leave
it
in
your
keeping
the
black
doctor
bishop's
crossing
is
a
small
village
lying
ten
miles
in
a
south-westerly
direction
from
liverpool
here
in
the
early
seventies
there
settled
a
doctor
named
aloysius
lana
nothing
was
known
locally
either
of
his
antecedents
or
of
the
reasons
which
had
prompted
him
to
come
to
this
lancashire
hamlet
two
facts
only
were
certain
about
him
the
one
that
he
had
gained
his
medical
qualification
with
some
distinction
at
glasgow
the
other
that
he
came
undoubtedly
of
a
tropical
race
and
was
so
dark
that
he
might
almost
have
had
a
strain
of
the
indian
in
his
composition
his
predominant
features
were
however
european
and
he
possessed
a
stately
courtesy
and
carriage
which
suggested
a
spanish
extraction
a
swarthy
skin
raven-black
hair
and
dark
sparkling
eyes
under
a
pair
of
heavily-tufted
brows
made
a
strange
contrast
to
the
flaxen
or
chestnut
rustics
of
england
and
the
newcomer
was
soon
known
as
the
black
doctor
of
bishop's
crossing
at
first
it
was
a
term
of
ridicule
and
reproach
as
the
years
went
on
it
became
a
title
of
honour
which
was
familiar
to
the
whole
countryside
and
extended
far
beyond
the
narrow
confines
of
the
village
for
the
newcomer
proved
himself
to
be
a
capable
surgeon
and
an
accomplished
physician
the
practice
of
that
district
had
been
in
the
hands
of
edward
rowe
the
son
of
sir
william
rowe
the
liverpool
consultant
but
he
had
not
inherited
the
talents
of
his
father
and
dr
lana
with
his
advantages
of
presence
and
of
manner
soon
beat
him
out
of
the
field
dr
lana's
social
success
was
as
rapid
as
his
professional
a
remarkable
surgical
cure
in
the
case
of
the
hon
james
lowry
the
second
son
of
lord
belton
was
the
means
of
introducing
him
to
county
society
where
he
became
a
favourite
through
the
charm
of
his
conversation
and
the
elegance
of
his
manners
an
absence
of
antecedents
and
of
relatives
is
sometimes
an
aid
rather
than
an
impediment
to
social
advancement
and
the
distinguished
individuality
of
the
handsome
doctor
was
its
own
recommendation
his
patients
had
one
fault--and
one
fault
only--to
find
with
him
he
appeared
to
be
a
confirmed
bachelor
this
was
the
more
remarkable
since
the
house
which
he
occupied
was
a
large
one
and
it
was
known
that
his
success
in
practice
had
enabled
him
to
save
considerable
sums
at
first
the
local
matchmakers
were
continually
coupling
his
name
with
one
or
other
of
the
eligible
ladies
but
as
years
passed
and
dr
lana
remained
unmarried
it
came
to
be
generally
understood
that
for
some
reason
he
must
remain
a
bachelor
some
even
went
so
far
as
to
assert
that
he
was
already
married
and
that
it
was
in
order
to
escape
the
consequence
of
an
early
misalliance
that
he
had
buried
himself
at
bishop's
crossing
and
then
just
as
the
matchmakers
had
finally
given
him
up
in
despair
his
engagement
was
suddenly
announced
to
miss
frances
morton
of
leigh
hall
miss
morton
was
a
young
lady
who
was
well
known
upon
the
country-side
her
father
james
haldane
morton
having
been
the
squire
of
bishop's
crossing
both
her
parents
were
however
dead
and
she
lived
with
her
only
brother
arthur
morton
who
had
inherited
the
family
estate
in
person
miss
morton
was
tall
and
stately
and
she
was
famous
for
her
quick
impetuous
nature
and
for
her
strength
of
character
she
met
dr
lana
at
a
garden-party
and
a
friendship
which
quickly
ripened
into
love
sprang
up
between
them
nothing
could
exceed
their
devotion
to
each
other
there
was
some
discrepancy
in
age
he
being
thirty-seven
and
she
twenty-four
but
save
in
that
one
respect
there
was
no
possible
objection
to
be
found
with
the
match
the
engagement
was
in
february
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
in
august
upon
the
3rd
of
june
dr
lana
received
a
letter
from
abroad
in
a
small
village
the
postmaster
is
also
in
a
position
to
be
the
gossip-master
and
mr
bankley
of
bishop's
crossing
had
many
of
the
secrets
of
his
neighbours
in
his
possession
of
this
particular
letter
he
remarked
only
that
it
was
in
a
curious
envelope
that
it
was
in
a
man's
handwriting
that
the
postscript
was
buenos
ayres
and
the
stamp
of
the
argentine
republic
it
was
the
first
letter
which
he
had
ever
known
dr
lana
to
have
from
abroad
and
this
was
the
reason
why
his
attention
was
particularly
called
to
it
before
he
handed
it
to
the
local
postman
it
was
delivered
by
the
evening
delivery
of
that
date
next
morning--that
is
upon
the
4th
of
june--dr
lana
called
upon
miss
morton
and
a
long
interview
followed
from
which
he
was
observed
to
return
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
miss
morton
remained
in
her
room
all
that
day
and
her
maid
found
her
several
times
in
tears
in
the
course
of
a
week
it
was
an
open
secret
to
the
whole
village
that
the
engagement
was
at
an
end
that
dr
lana
had
behaved
shamefully
to
the
young
lady
and
that
arthur
morton
her
brother
was
talking
of
horse-whipping
him
in
what
particular
respect
the
doctor
had
behaved
badly
was
unknown--some
surmised
one
thing
and
some
another
but
it
was
observed
and
taken
as
the
obvious
sign
of
a
guilty
conscience
that
he
would
go
for
miles
round
rather
than
pass
the
windows
of
leigh
hall
and
that
he
gave
up
attending
morning
service
upon
sundays
where
he
might
have
met
the
young
lady
there
was
an
advertisement
also
in
the
lancet
as
to
the
sale
of
a
practice
which
mentioned
no
names
but
which
was
thought
by
some
to
refer
to
bishop's
crossing
and
to
mean
that
dr
lana
was
thinking
of
abandoning
the
scene
of
his
success
such
was
the
position
of
affairs
when
upon
the
evening
of
monday
june
21st
there
came
a
fresh
development
which
changed
what
had
been
a
mere
village
scandal
into
a
tragedy
which
arrested
the
attention
of
the
whole
nation
some
detail
is
necessary
to
cause
the
facts
of
that
evening
to
present
their
full
significance
the
sole
occupants
of
the
doctor's
house
were
his
housekeeper
an
elderly
and
most
respectable
woman
named
martha
woods
and
a
young
servant--mary
pilling
the
coachman
and
the
surgery-boy
slept
out
it
was
the
custom
of
the
doctor
to
sit
at
night
in
his
study
which
was
next
the
surgery
in
the
wing
of
the
house
which
was
farthest
from
the
servants'
quarters
this
side
of
the
house
had
a
door
of
its
own
for
the
convenience
of
patients
so
that
it
was
possible
for
the
doctor
to
admit
and
receive
a
visitor
there
without
the
knowledge
of
anyone
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
patients
came
late
it
was
quite
usual
for
him
to
let
them
in
and
out
by
the
surgery
entrance
for
the
maid
and
the
housekeeper
were
in
the
habit
of
retiring
early
on
this
particular
night
martha
woods
went
into
the
doctor's
study
at
half-past
nine
and
found
him
writing
at
his
desk
she
bade
him
good
night
sent
the
maid
to
bed
and
then
occupied
herself
until
a
quarter
to
eleven
in
household
matters
it
was
striking
eleven
upon
the
hall
clock
when
she
went
to
her
own
room
she
had
been
there
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
twenty
minutes
when
she
heard
a
cry
or
call
which
appeared
to
come
from
within
the
house
she
waited
some
time
but
it
was
not
repeated
much
alarmed
for
the
sound
was
loud
and
urgent
she
put
on
a
dressing-gown
and
ran
at
the
top
of
her
speed
to
the
doctor's
study
who's
there
cried
a
voice
as
she
tapped
at
the
door
i
am
here
sir--mrs
woods
i
beg
that
you
will
leave
me
in
peace
go
back
to
your
room
this
instant
cried
the
voice
which
was
to
the
best
of
her
belief
that
of
her
master
the
tone
was
so
harsh
and
so
unlike
her
master's
usual
manner
that
she
was
surprised
and
hurt
i
thought
i
heard
you
calling
sir
she
explained
but
no
answer
was
given
to
her
mrs
woods
looked
at
the
clock
as
she
returned
to
her
room
and
it
was
then
half-past
eleven
at
some
period
between
eleven
and
twelve
she
could
not
be
positive
as
to
the
exact
hour
a
patient
called
upon
the
doctor
and
was
unable
to
get
any
reply
from
him
this
late
visitor
was
mrs
madding
the
wife
of
the
village
grocer
who
was
dangerously
ill
of
typhoid
fever
dr
lana
had
asked
her
to
look
in
the
last
thing
and
let
him
know
how
her
husband
was
progressing
she
observed
that
the
light
was
burning
in
the
study
but
having
knocked
several
times
at
the
surgery
door
without
response
she
concluded
that
the
doctor
had
been
called
out
and
so
returned
home
there
is
a
short
winding
drive
with
a
lamp
at
the
end
of
it
leading
down
from
the
house
to
the
road
as
mrs
madding
emerged
from
the
gate
a
man
was
coming
along
the
footpath
thinking
that
it
might
be
dr
lana
returning
from
some
professional
visit
she
waited
for
him
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
mr
arthur
morton
the
young
squire
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
she
observed
that
his
manner
was
excited
and
that
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
heavy
hunting-crop
he
was
turning
in
at
the
gate
when
she
addressed
him
the
doctor
is
not
in
sir
said
she
how
do
you
know
that
he
asked
harshly
i
have
been
to
the
surgery
door
sir
i
see
a
light
said
the
young
squire
looking
up
the
drive
that
is
in
his
study
is
it
not
yes
sir
but
i
am
sure
that
he
is
out
well
he
must
come
in
again
said
young
morton
and
passed
through
the
gate
while
mrs
madding
went
upon
her
homeward
way
at
three
o'clock
that
morning
her
husband
suffered
a
sharp
relapse
and
she
was
so
alarmed
by
his
symptoms
that
she
determined
to
call
the
doctor
without
delay
as
she
passed
through
the
gate
she
was
surprised
to
see
someone
lurking
among
the
laurel
bushes
it
was
certainly
a
man
and
to
the
best
of
her
belief
mr
arthur
morton
preoccupied
with
her
own
troubles
she
gave
no
particular
attention
to
the
incident
but
hurried
on
upon
her
errand
when
she
reached
the
house
she
perceived
to
her
surprise
that
the
light
was
still
burning
in
the
study
she
therefore
tapped
at
the
surgery
door
there
was
no
answer
she
repeated
the
knocking
several
times
without
effect
it
appeared
to
her
to
be
unlikely
that
the
doctor
would
either
go
to
bed
or
go
out
leaving
so
brilliant
a
light
behind
him
and
it
struck
mrs
madding
that
it
was
possible
that
he
might
have
dropped
asleep
in
his
chair
she
tapped
at
the
study
window
therefore
but
without
result
then
finding
that
there
was
an
opening
between
the
curtain
and
the
woodwork
she
looked
through
the
small
room
was
brilliantly
lighted
from
a
large
lamp
on
the
central
table
which
was
littered
with
the
doctor's
books
and
instruments
no
one
was
visible
nor
did
she
see
anything
unusual
except
that
in
the
farther
shadow
thrown
by
the
table
a
dingy
white
glove
was
lying
upon
the
carpet
and
then
suddenly
as
her
eyes
became
more
accustomed
to
the
light
a
boot
emerged
from
the
other
end
of
the
shadow
and
she
realized
with
a
thrill
of
horror
that
what
she
had
taken
to
be
a
glove
was
the
hand
of
a
man
who
was
prostrate
upon
the
floor
understanding
that
something
terrible
had
occurred
she
rang
at
the
front
door
roused
mrs
woods
the
housekeeper
and
the
two
women
made
their
way
into
the
study
having
first
dispatched
the
maidservant
to
the
police-station
at
the
side
of
the
table
away
from
the
window
dr
lana
was
discovered
stretched
upon
his
back
and
quite
dead
it
was
evident
that
he
had
been
subjected
to
violence
for
one
of
his
eyes
was
blackened
and
there
were
marks
of
bruises
about
his
face
and
neck
a
slight
thickening
and
swelling
of
his
features
appeared
to
suggest
that
the
cause
of
his
death
had
been
strangulation
he
was
dressed
in
his
usual
professional
clothes
but
wore
cloth
slippers
the
soles
of
which
were
perfectly
clean
the
carpet
was
marked
all
over
especially
on
the
side
of
the
door
with
traces
of
dirty
boots
which
were
presumably
left
by
the
murderer
it
was
evident
that
someone
had
entered
by
the
surgery
door
had
killed
the
doctor
and
had
then
made
his
escape
unseen
that
the
assailant
was
a
man
was
certain
from
the
size
of
the
footprints
and
from
the
nature
of
the
injuries
but
beyond
that
point
the
police
found
it
very
difficult
to
go
there
were
no
signs
of
robbery
and
the
doctor's
gold
watch
was
safe
in
his
pocket
he
kept
a
heavy
cash-box
in
the
room
and
this
was
discovered
to
be
locked
but
empty
mrs
woods
had
an
impression
that
a
large
sum
was
usually
kept
there
but
the
doctor
had
paid
a
heavy
corn
bill
in
cash
only
that
very
day
and
it
was
conjectured
that
it
was
to
this
and
not
to
a
robber
that
the
emptiness
of
the
box
was
due
one
thing
in
the
room
was
missing--but
that
one
thing
was
suggestive
the
portrait
of
miss
morton
which
had
always
stood
upon
the
side-table
had
been
taken
from
its
frame
and
carried
off
mrs
woods
had
observed
it
there
when
she
waited
upon
her
employer
that
evening
and
now
it
was
gone
on
the
other
hand
there
was
picked
up
from
the
floor
a
green
eye-patch
which
the
housekeeper
could
not
remember
to
have
seen
before
such
a
patch
might
however
be
in
the
possession
of
a
doctor
and
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
it
was
in
any
way
connected
with
the
crime
suspicion
could
only
turn
in
one
direction
and
arthur
morton
the
young
squire
was
immediately
arrested
the
evidence
against
him
was
circumstantial
but
damning
he
was
devoted
to
his
sister
and
it
was
shown
that
since
the
rupture
between
her
and
dr
lana
he
had
been
heard
again
and
again
to
express
himself
in
the
most
vindictive
terms
towards
her
former
lover
he
had
as
stated
been
seen
somewhere
about
eleven
o'clock
entering
the
doctor's
drive
with
a
hunting-crop
in
his
hand
he
had
then
according
to
the
theory
of
the
police
broken
in
upon
the
doctor
whose
exclamation
of
fear
or
of
anger
had
been
loud
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
mrs
woods
when
mrs
woods
descended
dr
lana
had
made
up
his
mind
to
talk
it
over
with
his
visitor
and
had
therefore
sent
his
housekeeper
back
to
her
room
this
conversation
had
lasted
a
long
time
had
become
more
and
more
fiery
and
had
ended
by
a
personal
struggle
in
which
the
doctor
lost
his
life
the
fact
revealed
by
a
post-mortem
that
his
heart
was
much
diseased--an
ailment
quite
unsuspected
during
his
life--would
make
it
possible
that
death
might
in
his
case
ensue
from
injuries
which
would
not
be
fatal
to
a
healthy
man
arthur
morton
had
then
removed
his
sister's
photograph
and
had
made
his
way
homeward
stepping
aside
into
the
laurel
bushes
to
avoid
mrs
madding
at
the
gate
this
was
the
theory
of
the
prosecution
and
the
case
which
they
presented
was
a
formidable
one
on
the
other
hand
there
were
some
strong
points
for
the
defence
morton
was
high-spirited
and
impetuous
like
his
sister
but
he
was
respected
and
liked
by
everyone
and
his
frank
and
honest
nature
seemed
to
be
incapable
of
such
a
crime
his
own
explanation
was
that
he
was
anxious
to
have
a
conversation
with
dr
lana
about
some
urgent
family
matters
from
first
to
last
he
refused
even
to
mention
the
name
of
his
sister
he
did
not
attempt
to
deny
that
this
conversation
would
probably
have
been
of
an
unpleasant
nature
he
had
heard
from
a
patient
that
the
doctor
was
out
and
he
therefore
waited
until
about
three
in
the
morning
for
his
return
but
as
he
had
seen
nothing
of
him
up
to
that
hour
he
had
given
it
up
and
had
returned
home
as
to
his
death
he
knew
no
more
about
it
than
the
constable
who
arrested
him
he
had
formerly
been
an
intimate
friend
of
the
deceased
man
but
circumstances
which
he
would
prefer
not
to
mention
had
brought
about
a
change
in
his
sentiments
there
were
several
facts
which
supported
his
innocence
it
was
certain
that
dr
lana
was
alive
and
in
his
study
at
half-past
eleven
o'clock
mrs
woods
was
prepared
to
swear
that
it
was
at
that
hour
that
she
had
heard
his
voice
the
friends
of
the
prisoner
contended
that
it
was
probable
that
at
that
time
dr
lana
was
not
alone
the
sound
which
had
originally
attracted
the
attention
of
the
housekeeper
and
her
master's
unusual
impatience
that
she
should
leave
him
in
peace
seemed
to
point
to
that
if
this
were
so
then
it
appeared
to
be
probable
that
he
had
met
his
end
between
the
moment
when
the
housekeeper
heard
his
voice
and
the
time
when
mrs
madding
made
her
first
call
and
found
it
impossible
to
attract
his
attention
but
if
this
were
the
time
of
his
death
then
it
was
certain
that
mr
arthur
morton
could
not
be
guilty
as
it
was
after
this
that
she
had
met
the
young
squire
at
the
gate
if
this
hypothesis
were
correct
and
someone
was
with
dr
lana
before
mrs
madding
met
mr
arthur
morton
then
who
was
this
someone
and
what
motives
had
he
for
wishing
evil
to
the
doctor
it
was
universally
admitted
that
if
the
friends
of
the
accused
could
throw
light
upon
this
they
would
have
gone
a
long
way
towards
establishing
his
innocence
but
in
the
meanwhile
it
was
open
to
the
public
to
say--as
they
did
say--that
there
was
no
proof
that
anyone
had
been
there
at
all
except
the
young
squire
while
on
the
other
hand
there
was
ample
proof
that
his
motives
in
going
were
of
a
sinister
kind
when
mrs
madding
called
the
doctor
might
have
retired
to
his
room
or
he
might
as
she
thought
at
the
time
have
gone
out
and
returned
afterwards
to
find
mr
arthur
morton
waiting
for
him
some
of
the
supporters
of
the
accused
laid
stress
upon
the
fact
that
the
photograph
of
his
sister
frances
which
had
been
removed
from
the
doctor's
room
had
not
been
found
in
her
brother's
possession
this
argument
however
did
not
count
for
much
as
he
had
ample
time
before
his
arrest
to
burn
it
or
to
destroy
it
as
to
the
only
positive
evidence
in
the
case--the
muddy
footmarks
upon
the
floor--they
were
so
blurred
by
the
softness
of
the
carpet
that
it
was
impossible
to
make
any
trustworthy
deduction
from
them
the
most
that
could
be
said
was
that
their
appearance
was
not
inconsistent
with
the
theory
that
they
were
made
by
the
accused
and
it
was
further
shown
that
his
boots
were
very
muddy
upon
that
night
there
had
been
a
heavy
shower
in
the
afternoon
and
all
boots
were
probably
in
the
same
condition
such
is
a
bald
statement
of
the
singular
and
romantic
series
of
events
which
centred
public
attention
upon
this
lancashire
tragedy
the
unknown
origin
of
the
doctor
his
curious
and
distinguished
personality
the
position
of
the
man
who
was
accused
of
the
murder
and
the
love
affair
which
had
preceded
the
crimes
all
combined
to
make
the
affair
one
of
those
dramas
which
absorb
the
whole
interest
of
a
nation
throughout
the
three
kingdoms
men
discussed
the
case
of
the
black
doctor
of
bishop's
crossing
and
many
were
the
theories
put
forward
to
explain
the
facts
but
it
may
safely
be
said
that
among
them
all
there
was
not
one
which
prepared
the
minds
of
the
public
for
the
extraordinary
sequel
which
caused
so
much
excitement
upon
the
first
day
of
the
trial
and
came
to
a
climax
upon
the
second
the
long
files
of
the
lancaster
weekly
with
their
report
of
the
case
lie
before
me
as
i
write
but
i
must
content
myself
with
a
synopsis
of
the
case
up
to
the
point
when
upon
the
evening
of
the
first
day
the
evidence
of
miss
frances
morton
threw
a
singular
light
upon
the
case
mr
porlock
carr
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
had
marshalled
his
facts
with
his
usual
skill
and
as
the
day
wore
on
it
became
more
and
more
evident
how
difficult
was
the
task
which
mr
humphrey
who
had
been
retained
for
the
defence
had
before
him
several
witnesses
were
put
up
to
swear
to
the
intemperate
expressions
which
the
young
squire
had
been
heard
to
utter
about
the
doctor
and
the
fiery
manner
in
which
he
resented
the
alleged
ill-treatment
of
his
sister
mrs
madding
repeated
her
evidence
as
to
the
visit
which
had
been
paid
late
at
night
by
the
prisoner
to
the
deceased
and
it
was
shown
by
another
witness
that
the
prisoner
was
aware
that
the
doctor
was
in
the
habit
of
sitting
up
alone
in
this
isolated
wing
of
the
house
and
that
he
had
chosen
this
very
late
hour
to
call
because
he
knew
that
his
victim
would
then
be
at
his
mercy
a
servant
at
the
squire's
house
was
compelled
to
admit
that
he
had
heard
his
master
return
about
three
that
morning
which
corroborated
mrs
madding's
statement
that
she
had
seen
him
among
the
laurel
bushes
near
the
gate
upon
the
occasion
of
her
second
visit
the
muddy
boots
and
an
alleged
similarity
in
the
footprints
were
duly
dwelt
upon
and
it
was
felt
when
the
case
for
the
prosecution
had
been
presented
that
however
circumstantial
it
might
be
it
was
none
the
less
so
complete
and
so
convincing
that
the
fate
of
the
prisoner
was
sealed
unless
something
quite
unexpected
should
be
disclosed
by
the
defence
it
was
three
o'clock
when
the
prosecution
closed
at
half-past
four
when
the
court
rose
a
new
and
unlooked-for
development
had
occurred
i
extract
the
incident
or
part
of
it
from
the
journal
which
i
have
already
mentioned
omitting
the
preliminary
observations
of
the
counsel
considerable
sensation
was
caused
in
the
crowded
court
when
the
first
witness
called
for
the
defence
proved
to
be
miss
frances
morton
the
sister
of
the
prisoner
our
readers
will
remember
that
the
young
lady
had
been
engaged
to
dr
lana
and
that
it
was
his
anger
over
the
sudden
termination
of
this
engagement
which
was
thought
to
have
driven
her
brother
to
the
perpetration
of
this
crime
miss
morton
had
not
however
been
directly
implicated
in
the
case
in
any
way
either
at
the
inquest
or
at
the
police-court
proceedings
and
her
appearance
as
the
leading
witness
for
the
defence
came
as
a
surprise
upon
the
public
miss
frances
morton
who
was
a
tall
and
handsome
brunette
gave
her
evidence
in
a
low
but
clear
voice
though
it
was
evident
throughout
that
she
was
suffering
from
extreme
emotion
she
alluded
to
her
engagement
to
the
doctor
touched
briefly
upon
its
termination
which
was
due
she
said
to
personal
matters
connected
with
his
family
and
surprised
the
court
by
asserting
that
she
had
always
considered
her
brother's
resentment
to
be
unreasonable
and
intemperate
in
answer
to
a
direct
question
from
her
counsel
she
replied
that
she
did
not
feel
that
she
had
any
grievance
whatever
against
dr
lana
and
that
in
her
opinion
he
had
acted
in
a
perfectly
honourable
manner
her
brother
on
an
insufficient
knowledge
of
the
facts
had
taken
another
view
and
she
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
in
spite
of
her
entreaties
he
had
uttered
threats
of
personal
violence
against
the
doctor
and
had
upon
the
evening
of
the
tragedy
announced
his
intention
of
having
it
out
with
him
she
had
done
her
best
to
bring
him
to
a
more
reasonable
frame
of
mind
but
he
was
very
headstrong
where
his
emotions
or
prejudices
were
concerned
up
to
this
point
the
young
lady's
evidence
had
appeared
to
make
against
the
prisoner
rather
than
in
his
favour
the
questions
of
her
counsel
however
soon
put
a
very
different
light
upon
the
matter
and
disclosed
an
unexpected
line
of
defence
mr
humphrey
do
you
believe
your
brother
to
be
guilty
of
this
crime
the
judge
i
cannot
permit
that
question
mr
humphrey
we
are
here
to
decide
upon
questions
of
fact--not
of
belief
mr
humphrey
do
you
know
that
your
brother
is
not
guilty
of
the
death
of
doctor
lana
miss
morton
yes
mr
humphrey
how
do
you
know
it
miss
morton
because
dr
lana
is
not
dead
there
followed
a
prolonged
sensation
in
court
which
interrupted
the
examination
of
the
witness
mr
humphrey
and
how
do
you
know
miss
morton
that
dr
lana
is
not
dead
miss
morton
because
i
have
received
a
letter
from
him
since
the
date
of
his
supposed
death
mr
humphrey
have
you
this
letter
miss
morton
yes
but
i
should
prefer
not
to
show
it
mr
humphrey
have
you
the
envelope
miss
morton
yes
it
is
here
mr
humphrey
what
is
the
post-mark
miss
morton
liverpool
mr
humphrey
and
the
date
miss
morton
june
the
22nd
mr
humphrey
that
being
the
day
after
his
alleged
death
are
you
prepared
to
swear
to
this
handwriting
miss
morton
miss
morton
certainly
mr
humphrey
i
am
prepared
to
call
six
other
witnesses
my
lord
to
testify
that
this
letter
is
in
the
writing
of
doctor
lana
the
judge
then
you
must
call
them
tomorrow
mr
porlock
carr
counsel
for
the
prosecution
in
the
meantime
my
lord
we
claim
possession
of
this
document
so
that
we
may
obtain
expert
evidence
as
to
how
far
it
is
an
imitation
of
the
handwriting
of
the
gentleman
whom
we
still
confidently
assert
to
be
deceased
i
need
not
point
out
that
the
theory
so
unexpectedly
sprung
upon
us
may
prove
to
be
a
very
obvious
device
adopted
by
the
friends
of
the
prisoner
in
order
to
divert
this
inquiry
i
would
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
young
lady
must
according
to
her
own
account
have
possessed
this
letter
during
the
proceedings
at
the
inquest
and
at
the
police-court
she
desires
us
to
believe
that
she
permitted
these
to
proceed
although
she
held
in
her
pocket
evidence
which
would
at
any
moment
have
brought
them
to
an
end
mr
humphrey
can
you
explain
this
miss
morton
miss
morton
dr
lana
desired
his
secret
to
be
preserved
mr
porlock
carr
then
why
have
you
made
this
public
miss
morton
to
save
my
brother
a
murmur
of
sympathy
broke
out
in
court
which
was
instantly
suppressed
by
the
judge
the
judge
admitting
this
line
of
defence
it
lies
with
you
mr
humphrey
to
throw
a
light
upon
who
this
man
is
whose
body
has
been
recognized
by
so
many
friends
and
patients
of
dr
lana
as
being
that
of
the
doctor
himself
a
juryman
has
anyone
up
to
now
expressed
any
doubt
about
the
matter
mr
porlock
carr
not
to
my
knowledge
mr
humphrey
we
hope
to
make
the
matter
clear
the
judge
then
the
court
adjourns
until
tomorrow
this
new
development
of
the
case
excited
the
utmost
interest
among
the
general
public
press
comment
was
prevented
by
the
fact
that
the
trial
was
still
undecided
but
the
question
was
everywhere
argued
as
to
how
far
there
could
be
truth
in
miss
morton's
declaration
and
how
far
it
might
be
a
daring
ruse
for
the
purpose
of
saving
her
brother
the
obvious
dilemma
in
which
the
missing
doctor
stood
was
that
if
by
any
extraordinary
chance
he
was
not
dead
then
he
must
be
held
responsible
for
the
death
of
this
unknown
man
who
resembled
him
so
exactly
and
who
was
found
in
his
study
this
letter
which
miss
morton
refused
to
produce
was
possibly
a
confession
of
guilt
and
she
might
find
herself
in
the
terrible
position
of
only
being
able
to
save
her
brother
from
the
gallows
by
the
sacrifice
of
her
former
lover
the
court
next
morning
was
crammed
to
overflowing
and
a
murmur
of
excitement
passed
over
it
when
mr
humphrey
was
observed
to
enter
in
a
state
of
emotion
which
even
his
trained
nerves
could
not
conceal
and
to
confer
with
the
opposing
counsel
a
few
hurried
words--words
which
left
a
look
of
amazement
upon
mr
porlock
carr's
face--passed
between
them
and
then
the
counsel
for
the
defence
addressing
the
judge
announced
that
with
the
consent
of
the
prosecution
the
young
lady
who
had
given
evidence
upon
the
sitting
before
would
not
be
recalled
the
judge
but
you
appear
mr
humphrey
to
have
left
matters
in
a
very
unsatisfactory
state
mr
humphrey
perhaps
my
lord
my
next
witness
may
help
to
clear
them
up
the
judge
then
call
your
next
witness
mr
humphrey
i
call
dr
aloysius
lana
the
learned
counsel
has
made
many
telling
remarks
in
his
day
but
he
has
certainly
never
produced
such
a
sensation
with
so
short
a
sentence
the
court
was
simply
stunned
with
amazement
as
the
very
man
whose
fate
had
been
the
subject
of
so
much
contention
appeared
bodily
before
them
in
the
witness-box
those
among
the
spectators
who
had
known
him
at
bishop's
crossing
saw
him
now
gaunt
and
thin
with
deep
lines
of
care
upon
his
face
but
in
spite
of
his
melancholy
bearing
and
despondent
expression
there
were
few
who
could
say
that
they
had
ever
seen
a
man
of
more
distinguished
presence
bowing
to
the
judge
he
asked
if
he
might
be
allowed
to
make
a
statement
and
having
been
duly
informed
that
whatever
he
said
might
be
used
against
him
he
bowed
once
more
and
proceeded
my
wish
said
he
is
to
hold
nothing
back
but
to
tell
with
perfect
frankness
all
that
occurred
upon
the
night
of
the
21st
of
june
had
i
known
that
the
innocent
had
suffered
and
that
so
much
trouble
had
been
brought
upon
those
whom
i
love
best
in
the
world
i
should
have
come
forward
long
ago
but
there
were
reasons
which
prevented
these
things
from
coming
to
my
ears
it
was
my
desire
that
an
unhappy
man
should
vanish
from
the
world
which
had
known
him
but
i
had
not
foreseen
that
others
would
be
affected
by
my
actions
let
me
to
the
best
of
my
ability
repair
the
evil
which
i
have
done
to
anyone
who
is
acquainted
with
the
history
of
the
argentine
republic
the
name
of
lana
is
well
known
my
father
who
came
of
the
best
blood
of
old
spain
filled
all
the
highest
offices
of
the
state
and
would
have
been
president
but
for
his
death
in
the
riots
of
san
juan
a
brilliant
career
might
have
been
open
to
my
twin
brother
ernest
and
myself
had
it
not
been
for
financial
losses
which
made
it
necessary
that
we
should
earn
our
own
living
i
apologize
sir
if
these
details
appear
to
be
irrelevant
but
they
are
a
necessary
introduction
to
that
which
is
to
follow
i
had
as
i
have
said
a
twin
brother
named
ernest
whose
resemblance
to
me
was
so
great
that
even
when
we
were
together
people
could
see
no
difference
between
us
down
to
the
smallest
detail
we
were
exactly
the
same
as
we
grew
older
this
likeness
became
less
marked
because
our
expression
was
not
the
same
but
with
our
features
in
repose
the
points
of
difference
were
very
slight
it
does
not
become
me
to
say
too
much
of
one
who
is
dead
the
more
so
as
he
is
my
only
brother
but
i
leave
his
character
to
those
who
knew
him
best
i
will
only
say--for
i
have
to
say
it--that
in
my
early
manhood
i
conceived
a
horror
of
him
and
that
i
had
good
reason
for
the
aversion
which
filled
me
my
own
reputation
suffered
from
his
actions
for
our
close
resemblance
caused
me
to
be
credited
with
many
of
them
eventually
in
a
peculiarly
disgraceful
business
he
contrived
to
throw
the
whole
odium
upon
me
in
such
a
way
that
i
was
forced
to
leave
the
argentine
for
ever
and
to
seek
a
career
in
europe
the
freedom
from
his
hated
presence
more
than
compensated
me
for
the
loss
of
my
native
land
i
had
enough
money
to
defray
my
medical
studies
at
glasgow
and
i
finally
settled
in
practice
at
bishop's
crossing
in
the
firm
conviction
that
in
that
remote
lancashire
hamlet
i
should
never
hear
of
him
again
for
years
my
hopes
were
fulfilled
and
then
at
last
he
discovered
me
some
liverpool
man
who
visited
buenos
ayres
put
him
upon
my
track
he
had
lost
all
his
money
and
he
thought
that
he
would
come
over
and
share
mine
knowing
my
horror
of
him
he
rightly
thought
that
i
would
be
willing
to
buy
him
off
i
received
a
letter
from
him
saying
that
he
was
coming
it
was
at
a
crisis
in
my
own
affairs
and
his
arrival
might
conceivably
bring
trouble
and
even
disgrace
upon
some
whom
i
was
especially
bound
to
shield
from
anything
of
the
kind
i
took
steps
to
insure
that
any
evil
which
might
come
should
fall
on
me
only
and
that--here
he
turned
and
looked
at
the
prisoner--was
the
cause
of
conduct
upon
my
part
which
has
been
too
harshly
judged
my
only
motive
was
to
screen
those
who
were
dear
to
me
from
any
possible
connection
with
scandal
or
disgrace
that
scandal
and
disgrace
would
come
with
my
brother
was
only
to
say
that
what
had
been
would
be
again
my
brother
arrived
himself
one
night
not
very
long
after
my
receipt
of
the
letter
i
was
sitting
in
my
study
after
the
servants
had
gone
to
bed
when
i
heard
a
footstep
upon
the
gravel
outside
and
an
instant
later
i
saw
his
face
looking
in
at
me
through
the
window
he
was
a
clean-shaven
man
like
myself
and
the
resemblance
between
us
was
still
so
great
that
for
an
instant
i
thought
it
was
my
own
reflection
in
the
glass
he
had
a
dark
patch
over
his
eye
but
our
features
were
absolutely
the
same
then
he
smiled
in
a
sardonic
way
which
had
been
a
trick
of
his
from
his
boyhood
and
i
knew
that
he
was
the
same
brother
who
had
driven
me
from
my
native
land
and
brought
disgrace
upon
what
had
been
an
honourable
name
i
went
to
the
door
and
i
admitted
him
that
would
be
about
ten
o'clock
that
night
when
he
came
into
the
glare
of
the
lamp
i
saw
at
once
that
he
had
fallen
upon
very
evil
days
he
had
walked
from
liverpool
and
he
was
tired
and
ill
i
was
quite
shocked
by
the
expression
upon
his
face
my
medical
knowledge
told
me
that
there
was
some
serious
internal
malady
he
had
been
drinking
also
and
his
face
was
bruised
as
the
result
of
a
scuffle
which
he
had
had
with
some
sailors
it
was
to
cover
his
injured
eye
that
he
wore
this
patch
which
he
removed
when
he
entered
the
room
he
was
himself
dressed
in
a
pea-jacket
and
flannel
shirt
and
his
feet
were
bursting
through
his
boots
but
his
poverty
had
only
made
him
more
savagely
vindictive
towards
me
his
hatred
rose
to
the
height
of
a
mania
i
had
been
rolling
in
money
in
england
according
to
his
account
while
he
had
been
starving
in
south
america
i
cannot
describe
to
you
the
threats
which
he
uttered
or
the
insults
which
he
poured
upon
me
my
impression
is
that
hardships
and
debauchery
had
unhinged
his
reason
he
paced
about
the
room
like
a
wild
beast
demanding
drink
demanding
money
and
all
in
the
foulest
language
i
am
a
hot-tempered
man
but
i
thank
god
that
i
am
able
to
say
that
i
remained
master
of
myself
and
that
i
never
raised
a
hand
against
him
my
coolness
only
irritated
him
the
more
he
raved
he
cursed
he
shook
his
fists
in
my
face
and
then
suddenly
a
horrible
spasm
passed
over
his
features
he
clapped
his
hand
to
his
side
and
with
a
loud
cry
he
fell
in
a
heap
at
my
feet
i
raised
him
up
and
stretched
him
upon
the
sofa
but
no
answer
came
to
my
exclamations
and
the
hand
which
i
held
in
mine
was
cold
and
clammy
his
diseased
heart
had
broken
down
his
own
violence
had
killed
him
for
a
long
time
i
sat
as
if
i
were
in
some
dreadful
dream
staring
at
the
body
of
my
brother
i
was
aroused
by
the
knocking
of
mrs
woods
who
had
been
disturbed
by
that
dying
cry
i
sent
her
away
to
bed
shortly
afterwards
a
patient
tapped
at
the
surgery
door
but
as
i
took
no
notice
he
or
she
went
off
again
slowly
and
gradually
as
i
sat
there
a
plan
was
forming
itself
in
my
head
in
the
curious
automatic
way
in
which
plans
do
form
when
i
rose
from
my
chair
my
future
movements
were
finally
decided
upon
without
my
having
been
conscious
of
any
process
of
thought
it
was
an
instinct
which
irresistibly
inclined
me
towards
one
course
ever
since
that
change
in
my
affairs
to
which
i
have
alluded
bishop's
crossing
had
become
hateful
to
me
my
plans
of
life
had
been
ruined
and
i
had
met
with
hasty
judgments
and
unkind
treatment
where
i
had
expected
sympathy
it
is
true
that
any
danger
of
scandal
from
my
brother
had
passed
away
with
his
life
but
still
i
was
sore
about
the
past
and
felt
that
things
could
never
be
as
they
had
been
it
may
be
that
i
was
unduly
sensitive
and
that
i
had
not
made
sufficient
allowance
for
others
but
my
feelings
were
as
i
describe
any
chance
of
getting
away
from
bishop's
crossing
and
of
everyone
in
it
would
be
most
welcome
to
me
and
here
was
such
a
chance
as
i
could
never
have
dared
to
hope
for
a
chance
which
would
enable
me
to
make
a
clean
break
with
the
past
there
was
this
dead
man
lying
upon
the
sofa
so
like
me
that
save
for
some
little
thickness
and
coarseness
of
the
features
there
was
no
difference
at
all
no
one
had
seen
him
come
and
no
one
would
miss
him
we
were
both
clean-shaven
and
his
hair
was
about
the
same
length
as
my
own
if
i
changed
clothes
with
him
then
dr
aloysius
lana
would
be
found
lying
dead
in
his
study
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
an
unfortunate
fellow
and
of
a
blighted
career
there
was
plenty
of
ready
money
in
the
room
and
this
i
could
carry
away
with
me
to
help
me
to
start
once
more
in
some
other
land
in
my
brother's
clothes
i
could
walk
by
night
unobserved
as
far
as
liverpool
and
in
that
great
seaport
i
would
soon
find
some
means
of
leaving
the
country
after
my
lost
hopes
the
humblest
existence
where
i
was
unknown
was
far
preferable
in
my
estimation
to
a
practice
however
successful
in
bishop's
crossing
where
at
any
moment
i
might
come
face
to
face
with
those
whom
i
should
wish
if
it
were
possible
to
forget
i
determined
to
effect
the
change
and
i
did
so
i
will
not
go
into
particulars
for
the
recollection
is
as
painful
as
the
experience
but
in
an
hour
my
brother
lay
dressed
down
to
the
smallest
detail
in
my
clothes
while
i
slunk
out
by
the
surgery
door
and
taking
the
back
path
which
led
across
some
fields
i
started
off
to
make
the
best
of
my
way
to
liverpool
where
i
arrived
the
same
night
my
bag
of
money
and
a
certain
portrait
were
all
i
carried
out
of
the
house
and
i
left
behind
me
in
my
hurry
the
shade
which
my
brother
had
been
wearing
over
his
eye
everything
else
of
his
i
took
with
me
i
give
you
my
word
sir
that
never
for
one
instant
did
the
idea
occur
to
me
that
people
might
think
that
i
had
been
murdered
nor
did
i
imagine
that
anyone
might
be
caused
serious
danger
through
this
stratagem
by
which
i
endeavoured
to
gain
a
fresh
start
in
the
world
on
the
contrary
it
was
the
thought
of
relieving
others
from
the
burden
of
my
presence
which
was
always
uppermost
in
my
mind
a
sailing
vessel
was
leaving
liverpool
that
very
day
for
corunna
and
in
this
i
took
my
passage
thinking
that
the
voyage
would
give
me
time
to
recover
my
balance
and
to
consider
the
future
but
before
i
left
my
resolution
softened
i
bethought
me
that
there
was
one
person
in
the
world
to
whom
i
would
not
cause
an
hour
of
sadness
she
would
mourn
me
in
her
heart
however
harsh
and
unsympathetic
her
relatives
might
be
she
understood
and
appreciated
the
motives
upon
which
i
had
acted
and
if
the
rest
of
her
family
condemned
me
she
at
least
would
not
forget
and
so
i
sent
her
a
note
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
to
save
her
from
a
baseless
grief
if
under
the
pressure
of
events
she
broke
that
seal
she
has
my
entire
sympathy
and
forgiveness
it
was
only
last
night
that
i
returned
to
england
and
during
all
this
time
i
have
heard
nothing
of
the
sensation
which
my
supposed
death
had
caused
nor
of
the
accusation
that
mr
arthur
morton
had
been
concerned
in
it
it
was
in
a
late
evening
paper
that
i
read
an
account
of
the
proceedings
of
yesterday
and
i
have
come
this
morning
as
fast
as
an
express
train
could
bring
me
to
testify
to
the
truth
such
was
the
remarkable
statement
of
dr
aloysius
lana
which
brought
the
trial
to
a
sudden
termination
a
subsequent
investigation
corroborated
it
to
the
extent
of
finding
out
the
vessel
in
which
his
brother
ernest
lana
had
come
over
from
south
america
the
ship's
doctor
was
able
to
testify
that
he
had
complained
of
a
weak
heart
during
the
voyage
and
that
his
symptoms
were
consistent
with
such
a
death
as
was
described
as
to
dr
aloysius
lana
he
returned
to
the
village
from
which
he
had
made
so
dramatic
a
disappearance
and
a
complete
reconciliation
was
effected
between
him
and
the
young
squire
the
latter
having
acknowledged
that
he
had
entirely
misunderstood
the
other's
motives
in
withdrawing
from
his
engagement
that
another
reconciliation
followed
may
be
judged
from
a
notice
extracted
from
a
prominent
column
in
the
morning
post
a
marriage
was
solemnized
upon
september
19th
by
the
rev
stephen
johnson
at
the
parish
church
of
bishop's
crossing
between
aloysius
xavier
lana
son
of
don
alfredo
lana
formerly
foreign
minister
of
the
argentine
republic
and
frances
morton
only
daughter
of
the
late
james
morton
jp
of
leigh
hall
bishop's
crossing
lancashire
the
jew's
breastplate
my
particular
friend
ward
mortimer
was
one
of
the
best
men
of
his
day
at
everything
connected
with
oriental
archaeology
he
had
written
largely
upon
the
subject
he
had
lived
two
years
in
a
tomb
at
thebes
while
he
excavated
in
the
valley
of
the
kings
and
finally
he
had
created
a
considerable
sensation
by
his
exhumation
of
the
alleged
mummy
of
cleopatra
in
the
inner
room
of
the
temple
of
horus
at
philae
with
such
a
record
at
the
age
of
thirty-one
it
was
felt
that
a
considerable
career
lay
before
him
and
no
one
was
surprised
when
he
was
elected
to
the
curatorship
of
the
belmore
street
museum
which
carries
with
it
the
lectureship
at
the
oriental
college
and
an
income
which
has
sunk
with
the
fall
in
land
but
which
still
remains
at
that
ideal
sum
which
is
large
enough
to
encourage
an
investigator
but
not
so
large
as
to
enervate
him
there
was
only
one
reason
which
made
ward
mortimer's
position
a
little
difficult
at
the
belmore
street
museum
and
that
was
the
extreme
eminence
of
the
man
whom
he
had
to
succeed
professor
andreas
was
a
profound
scholar
and
a
man
of
european
reputation
his
lectures
were
frequented
by
students
from
every
part
of
the
world
and
his
admirable
management
of
the
collection
intrusted
to
his
care
was
a
commonplace
in
all
learned
societies
there
was
therefore
considerable
surprise
when
at
the
age
of
fifty-five
he
suddenly
resigned
his
position
and
retired
from
those
duties
which
had
been
both
his
livelihood
and
his
pleasure
he
and
his
daughter
left
the
comfortable
suite
of
rooms
which
had
formed
his
official
residence
in
connection
with
the
museum
and
my
friend
mortimer
who
was
a
bachelor
took
up
his
quarters
there
on
hearing
of
mortimer's
appointment
professor
andreas
had
written
him
a
very
kindly
and
flattering
congratulatory
letter
i
was
actually
present
at
their
first
meeting
and
i
went
with
mortimer
round
the
museum
when
the
professor
showed
us
the
admirable
collection
which
he
had
cherished
so
long
the
professor's
beautiful
daughter
and
a
young
man
captain
wilson
who
was
as
i
understood
soon
to
be
her
husband
accompanied
us
in
our
inspection
there
were
fifteen
rooms
but
the
babylonian
the
syrian
and
the
central
hall
which
contained
the
jewish
and
egyptian
collection
were
the
finest
of
all
professor
andreas
was
a
quiet
dry
elderly
man
with
a
clean-shaven
face
and
an
impassive
manner
but
his
dark
eyes
sparkled
and
his
features
quickened
into
enthusiastic
life
as
he
pointed
out
to
us
the
rarity
and
the
beauty
of
some
of
his
specimens
his
hand
lingered
so
fondly
over
them
that
one
could
read
his
pride
in
them
and
the
grief
in
his
heart
now
that
they
were
passing
from
his
care
into
that
of
another
he
had
shown
us
in
turn
his
mummies
his
papyri
his
rare
scarabs
his
inscriptions
his
jewish
relics
and
his
duplication
of
the
famous
seven-branched
candlestick
of
the
temple
which
was
brought
to
rome
by
titus
and
which
is
supposed
by
some
to
be
lying
at
this
instant
in
the
bed
of
the
tiber
then
he
approached
a
case
which
stood
in
the
very
centre
of
the
hall
and
he
looked
down
through
the
glass
with
reverence
in
his
attitude
and
manner
this
is
no
novelty
to
an
expert
like
yourself
mr
mortimer
said
he
but
i
daresay
that
your
friend
mr
jackson
will
be
interested
to
see
it
leaning
over
the
case
i
saw
an
object
some
five
inches
square
which
consisted
of
twelve
precious
stones
in
a
framework
of
gold
with
golden
hooks
at
two
of
the
corners
the
stones
were
all
varying
in
sort
and
colour
but
they
were
of
the
same
size
their
shapes
arrangement
and
gradation
of
tint
made
me
think
of
a
box
of
water-colour
paints
each
stone
had
some
hieroglyphic
scratched
upon
its
surface
you
have
heard
mr
jackson
of
the
urim
and
thummim
i
had
heard
the
term
but
my
idea
of
its
meaning
was
exceedingly
vague
the
urim
and
thummim
was
a
name
given
to
the
jewelled
plate
which
lay
upon
the
breast
of
the
high
priest
of
the
jews
they
had
a
very
special
feeling
of
reverence
for
it--something
of
the
feeling
which
an
ancient
roman
might
have
for
the
sibylline
books
in
the
capitol
there
are
as
you
see
twelve
magnificent
stones
inscribed
with
mystical
characters
counting
from
the
left-hand
top
corner
the
stones
are
carnelian
peridot
emerald
ruby
lapis
lazuli
onyx
sapphire
agate
amethyst
topaz
beryl
and
jasper
i
was
amazed
at
the
variety
and
beauty
of
the
stones
has
the
breastplate
any
particular
history
i
asked
it
is
of
great
age
and
of
immense
value
said
professor
andreas
without
being
able
to
make
an
absolute
assertion
we
have
many
reasons
to
think
that
it
is
possible
that
it
may
be
the
original
urim
and
thummim
of
solomon's
temple
there
is
certainly
nothing
so
fine
in
any
collection
in
europe
my
friend
captain
wilson
here
is
a
practical
authority
upon
precious
stones
and
he
would
tell
you
how
pure
these
are
captain
wilson
a
man
with
a
dark
hard
incisive
face
was
standing
beside
his
fiancee
at
the
other
side
of
the
case
yes
said
he
curtly
i
have
never
seen
finer
stones
and
the
gold-work
is
also
worthy
of
attention
the
ancients
excelled
in------he
was
apparently
about
to
indicate
the
setting
of
the
stones
when
captain
wilson
interrupted
him
you
will
see
a
finer
example
of
their
gold-work
in
this
candlestick
said
he
turning
to
another
table
and
we
all
joined
him
in
his
admiration
of
its
embossed
stem
and
delicately
ornamented
branches
altogether
it
was
an
interesting
and
a
novel
experience
to
have
objects
of
such
rarity
explained
by
so
great
an
expert
and
when
finally
professor
andreas
finished
our
inspection
by
formally
handing
over
the
precious
collection
to
the
care
of
my
friend
i
could
not
help
pitying
him
and
envying
his
successor
whose
life
was
to
pass
in
so
pleasant
a
duty
within
a
week
ward
mortimer
was
duly
installed
in
his
new
set
of
rooms
and
had
become
the
autocrat
of
the
belmore
street
museum
about
a
fortnight
afterwards
my
friend
gave
a
small
dinner
to
half
a
dozen
bachelor
friends
to
celebrate
his
promotion
when
his
guests
were
departing
he
pulled
my
sleeve
and
signalled
to
me
that
he
wished
me
to
remain
you
have
only
a
few
hundred
yards
to
go
said
he--i
was
living
in
chambers
in
the
albany
you
may
as
well
stay
and
have
a
quiet
cigar
with
me
i
very
much
want
your
advice
i
relapsed
into
an
arm-chair
and
lit
one
of
his
excellent
matronas
when
he
had
returned
from
seeing
the
last
of
his
guests
out
he
drew
a
letter
from
his
dress-jacket
and
sat
down
opposite
to
me
this
is
an
anonymous
letter
which
i
received
this
morning
said
he
i
want
to
read
it
to
you
and
to
have
your
advice
you
are
very
welcome
to
it
for
what
it
is
worth
this
is
how
the
note
runs
'sir--i
should
strongly
advise
you
to
keep
a
very
careful
watch
over
the
many
valuable
things
which
are
committed
to
your
charge
i
do
not
think
that
the
present
system
of
a
single
watchman
is
sufficient
be
upon
your
guard
or
an
irreparable
misfortune
may
occur'
is
that
all
yes
that
is
all
well
said
i
it
is
at
least
obvious
that
it
was
written
by
one
of
the
limited
number
of
people
who
are
aware
that
you
have
only
one
watchman
at
night
ward
mortimer
handed
me
the
note
with
a
curious
smile
have
you
an
eye
for
handwriting
said
he
now
look
at
this
he
put
another
letter
in
front
of
me
look
at
the
c
in
'congratulate'
and
the
c
in
'committed'
look
at
the
capital
i
look
at
the
trick
of
putting
in
a
dash
instead
of
a
stop
they
are
undoubtedly
from
the
same
hand--with
some
attempt
at
disguise
in
the
case
of
this
first
one
the
second
said
ward
mortimer
is
the
letter
of
congratulation
which
was
written
to
me
by
professor
andreas
upon
my
obtaining
my
appointment
i
stared
at
him
in
amazement
then
i
turned
over
the
letter
in
my
hand
and
there
sure
enough
was
martin
andreas
signed
upon
the
other
side
there
could
be
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
anyone
who
had
the
slightest
knowledge
of
the
science
of
graphology
that
the
professor
had
written
an
anonymous
letter
warning
his
successor
against
thieves
it
was
inexplicable
but
it
was
certain
why
should
he
do
it
i
asked
precisely
what
i
should
wish
to
ask
you
if
he
had
any
such
misgivings
why
could
he
not
come
and
tell
me
direct
will
you
speak
to
him
about
it
there
again
i
am
in
doubt
he
might
choose
to
deny
that
he
wrote
it
at
any
rate
said
i
this
warning
is
meant
in
a
friendly
spirit
and
i
should
certainly
act
upon
it
are
the
present
precautions
enough
to
insure
you
against
robbery
i
should
have
thought
so
the
public
are
only
admitted
from
ten
till
five
and
there
is
a
guardian
to
every
two
rooms
he
stands
at
the
door
between
them
and
so
commands
them
both
but
at
night
when
the
public
are
gone
we
at
once
put
up
the
great
iron
shutters
which
are
absolutely
burglar-proof
the
watchman
is
a
capable
fellow
he
sits
in
the
lodge
but
he
walks
round
every
three
hours
we
keep
one
electric
light
burning
in
each
room
all
night
it
is
difficult
to
suggest
anything
more--short
of
keeping
your
day
watches
all
night
we
could
not
afford
that
at
least
i
should
communicate
with
the
police
and
have
a
special
constable
put
on
outside
in
belmore
street
said
i
as
to
the
letter
if
the
writer
wishes
to
be
anonymous
i
think
he
has
a
right
to
remain
so
we
must
trust
to
the
future
to
show
some
reason
for
the
curious
course
which
he
has
adopted
so
we
dismissed
the
subject
but
all
that
night
after
my
return
to
my
chambers
i
was
puzzling
my
brain
as
to
what
possible
motive
professor
andreas
could
have
for
writing
an
anonymous
warning
letter
to
his
successor--for
that
the
writing
was
his
was
as
certain
to
me
as
if
i
had
seen
him
actually
doing
it
he
foresaw
some
danger
to
the
collection
was
it
because
he
foresaw
it
that
he
abandoned
his
charge
of
it
but
if
so
why
should
he
hesitate
to
warn
mortimer
in
his
own
name
i
puzzled
and
puzzled
until
at
last
i
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep
which
carried
me
beyond
my
usual
hour
of
rising
i
was
aroused
in
a
singular
and
effective
method
for
about
nine
o'clock
my
friend
mortimer
rushed
into
my
room
with
an
expression
of
consternation
upon
his
face
he
was
usually
one
of
the
most
tidy
men
of
my
acquaintance
but
now
his
collar
was
undone
at
one
end
his
tie
was
flying
and
his
hat
at
the
back
of
his
head
i
read
his
whole
story
in
his
frantic
eyes
the
museum
has
been
robbed
i
cried
springing
up
in
bed
i
fear
so
those
jewels
the
jewels
of
the
urim
and
thummim
he
gasped
for
he
was
out
of
breath
with
running
i'm
going
on
to
the
police-station
come
to
the
museum
as
soon
as
you
can
jackson
good-bye
he
rushed
distractedly
out
of
the
room
and
i
heard
him
clatter
down
the
stairs
i
was
not
long
in
following
his
directions
but
i
found
when
i
arrived
that
he
had
already
returned
with
a
police
inspector
and
another
elderly
gentleman
who
proved
to
be
mr
purvis
one
of
the
partners
of
morson
and
company
the
well-known
diamond
merchants
as
an
expert
in
stones
he
was
always
prepared
to
advise
the
police
they
were
grouped
round
the
case
in
which
the
breastplate
of
the
jewish
priest
had
been
exposed
the
plate
had
been
taken
out
and
laid
upon
the
glass
top
of
the
case
and
the
three
heads
were
bent
over
it
it
is
obvious
that
it
has
been
tampered
with
said
mortimer
it
caught
my
eye
the
moment
that
i
passed
through
the
room
this
morning
i
examined
it
yesterday
evening
so
that
it
is
certain
that
this
has
happened
during
the
night
it
was
as
he
had
said
obvious
that
someone
had
been
at
work
upon
it
the
settings
of
the
uppermost
row
of
four
stones--the
carnelian
peridot
emerald
and
ruby--were
rough
and
jagged
as
if
someone
had
scraped
all
round
them
the
stones
were
in
their
places
but
the
beautiful
gold-work
which
we
had
admired
only
a
few
days
before
had
been
very
clumsily
pulled
about
it
looks
to
me
said
the
police
inspector
as
if
someone
had
been
trying
to
take
out
the
stones
my
fear
is
said
mortimer
that
he
not
only
tried
but
succeeded
i
believe
these
four
stones
to
be
skilful
imitations
which
have
been
put
in
the
place
of
the
originals
the
same
suspicion
had
evidently
been
in
the
mind
of
the
expert
for
he
had
been
carefully
examining
the
four
stones
with
the
aid
of
a
lens
he
now
submitted
them
to
several
tests
and
finally
turned
cheerfully
to
mortimer
i
congratulate
you
sir
said
he
heartily
i
will
pledge
my
reputation
that
all
four
of
these
stones
are
genuine
and
of
a
most
unusual
degree
of
purity
the
colour
began
to
come
back
to
my
poor
friend's
frightened
face
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
thank
god
he
cried
then
what
in
the
world
did
the
thief
want
probably
he
meant
to
take
the
stones
but
was
interrupted
in
that
case
one
would
expect
him
to
take
them
out
one
at
a
time
but
the
setting
of
each
of
these
has
been
loosened
and
yet
the
stones
are
all
here
it
is
certainly
most
extraordinary
said
the
inspector
i
never
remember
a
case
like
it
let
us
see
the
watchman
the
commissionaire
was
called--a
soldierly
honest-faced
man
who
seemed
as
concerned
as
ward
mortimer
at
the
incident
no
sir
i
never
heard
a
sound
he
answered
in
reply
to
the
questions
of
the
inspector
i
made
my
rounds
four
times
as
usual
but
i
saw
nothing
suspicious
i've
been
in
my
position
ten
years
but
nothing
of
the
kind
has
ever
occurred
before
no
thief
could
have
come
through
the
windows
impossible
sir
or
passed
you
at
the
door
no
sir
i
never
left
my
post
except
when
i
walked
my
rounds
what
other
openings
are
there
in
the
museum
there
is
the
door
into
mr
ward
mortimer's
private
rooms
that
is
locked
at
night
my
friend
explained
and
in
order
to
reach
it
anyone
from
the
street
would
have
to
open
the
outside
door
as
well
your
servants
their
quarters
are
entirely
separate
well
well
said
the
inspector
this
is
certainly
very
obscure
however
there
has
been
no
harm
done
according
to
mr
purvis
i
will
swear
that
those
stones
are
genuine
so
that
the
case
appears
to
be
merely
one
of
malicious
damage
but
none
the
less
i
should
be
very
glad
to
go
carefully
round
the
premises
and
to
see
if
we
can
find
any
trace
to
show
us
who
your
visitor
may
have
been
his
investigation
which
lasted
all
the
morning
was
careful
and
intelligent
but
it
led
in
the
end
to
nothing
he
pointed
out
to
us
that
there
were
two
possible
entrances
to
the
museum
which
we
had
not
considered
the
one
was
from
the
cellars
by
a
trap-door
opening
in
the
passage
the
other
through
a
skylight
from
the
lumber-room
overlooking
that
very
chamber
to
which
the
intruder
had
penetrated
as
neither
the
cellar
nor
the
lumber-room
could
be
entered
unless
the
thief
was
already
within
the
locked
doors
the
matter
was
not
of
any
practical
importance
and
the
dust
of
cellar
and
attic
assured
us
that
no
one
had
used
either
one
or
the
other
finally
we
ended
as
we
began
without
the
slightest
clue
as
to
how
why
or
by
whom
the
setting
of
these
four
jewels
had
been
tampered
with
there
remained
one
course
for
mortimer
to
take
and
he
took
it
leaving
the
police
to
continue
their
fruitless
researches
he
asked
me
to
accompany
him
that
afternoon
in
a
visit
to
professor
andreas
he
took
with
him
the
two
letters
and
it
was
his
intention
to
openly
tax
his
predecessor
with
having
written
the
anonymous
warning
and
to
ask
him
to
explain
the
fact
that
he
should
have
anticipated
so
exactly
that
which
had
actually
occurred
the
professor
was
living
in
a
small
villa
in
upper
norwood
but
we
were
informed
by
the
servant
that
he
was
away
from
home
seeing
our
disappointment
she
asked
us
if
we
should
like
to
see
miss
andreas
and
showed
us
into
the
modest
drawing-room
i
have
mentioned
incidentally
that
the
professor's
daughter
was
a
very
beautiful
girl
she
was
a
blonde
tall
and
graceful
with
a
skin
of
that
delicate
tint
which
the
french
call
mat
the
colour
of
old
ivory
or
of
the
lighter
petals
of
the
sulphur
rose
i
was
shocked
however
as
she
entered
the
room
to
see
how
much
she
had
changed
in
the
last
fortnight
her
young
face
was
haggard
and
her
bright
eyes
heavy
with
trouble
father
has
gone
to
scotland
she
said
he
seems
to
be
tired
and
has
had
a
good
deal
to
worry
him
he
only
left
us
yesterday
you
look
a
little
tired
yourself
miss
andreas
said
my
friend
i
have
been
so
anxious
about
father
can
you
give
me
his
scotch
address
yes
he
is
with
his
brother
the
rev
david
andreas
1
arran
villas
ardrossan
ward
mortimer
made
a
note
of
the
address
and
we
left
without
saying
anything
as
to
the
object
of
our
visit
we
found
ourselves
in
belmore
street
in
the
evening
in
exactly
the
same
position
in
which
we
had
been
in
the
morning
our
only
clue
was
the
professor's
letter
and
my
friend
had
made
up
his
mind
to
start
for
ardrossan
next
day
and
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
anonymous
letter
when
a
new
development
came
to
alter
our
plans
very
early
on
the
following
morning
i
was
aroused
from
my
sleep
by
a
tap
upon
my
bedroom
door
it
was
a
messenger
with
a
note
from
mortimer
do
come
round
it
said
the
matter
is
becoming
more
and
more
extraordinary
when
i
obeyed
his
summons
i
found
him
pacing
excitedly
up
and
down
the
central
room
while
the
old
soldier
who
guarded
the
premises
stood
with
military
stiffness
in
a
corner
my
dear
jackson
he
cried
i
am
so
delighted
that
you
have
come
for
this
is
a
most
inexplicable
business
what
has
happened
then
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
case
which
contained
the
breastplate
look
at
it
said
he
i
did
so
and
could
not
restrain
a
cry
of
surprise
the
setting
of
the
middle
row
of
precious
stones
had
been
profaned
in
the
same
manner
as
the
upper
ones
of
the
twelve
jewels
eight
had
been
now
tampered
with
in
this
singular
fashion
the
setting
of
the
lower
four
was
neat
and
smooth
the
others
jagged
and
irregular
have
the
stones
been
altered
i
asked
no
i
am
certain
that
these
upper
four
are
the
same
which
the
expert
pronounced
to
be
genuine
for
i
observed
yesterday
that
little
discoloration
on
the
edge
of
the
emerald
since
they
have
not
extracted
the
upper
stones
there
is
no
reason
to
think
the
lower
have
been
transposed
you
say
that
you
heard
nothing
simpson
no
sir
the
commissionaire
answered
but
when
i
made
my
round
after
daylight
i
had
a
special
look
at
these
stones
and
i
saw
at
once
that
someone
had
been
meddling
with
them
then
i
called
you
sir
and
told
you
i
was
backwards
and
forwards
all
night
and
i
never
saw
a
soul
or
heard
a
sound
come
up
and
have
some
breakfast
with
me
said
mortimer
and
he
took
me
into
his
own
chambers--now
what
do
you
think
of
this
jackson
he
asked
it
is
the
most
objectless
futile
idiotic
business
that
ever
i
heard
of
it
can
only
be
the
work
of
a
monomaniac
can
you
put
forward
any
theory
a
curious
idea
came
into
my
head
this
object
is
a
jewish
relic
of
great
antiquity
and
sanctity
said
i
how
about
the
anti-semitic
movement
could
one
conceive
that
a
fanatic
of
that
way
of
thinking
might
desecrate----
no
no
no
cried
mortimer
that
will
never
do
such
a
man
might
push
his
lunacy
to
the
length
of
destroying
a
jewish
relic
but
why
on
earth
should
he
nibble
round
every
stone
so
carefully
that
he
can
only
do
four
stones
in
a
night
we
must
have
a
better
solution
than
that
and
we
must
find
it
for
ourselves
for
i
do
not
think
that
our
inspector
is
likely
to
help
us
first
of
all
what
do
you
think
of
simpson
the
porter
have
you
any
reason
to
suspect
him
only
that
he
is
the
one
person
on
the
premises
but
why
should
he
indulge
in
such
wanton
destruction
nothing
has
been
taken
away
he
has
no
motive
mania
no
i
will
swear
to
his
sanity
have
you
any
other
theory
well
yourself
for
example
you
are
not
a
somnambulist
by
any
chance
nothing
of
the
sort
i
assure
you
then
i
give
it
up
but
i
don't--and
i
have
a
plan
by
which
we
will
make
it
all
clear
to
visit
professor
andreas
no
we
shall
find
our
solution
nearer
than
scotland
i
will
tell
you
what
we
shall
do
you
know
that
skylight
which
overlooks
the
central
hall
we
will
leave
the
electric
lights
in
the
hall
and
we
will
keep
watch
in
the
lumber-room
you
and
i
and
solve
the
mystery
for
ourselves
if
our
mysterious
visitor
is
doing
four
stones
at
a
time
he
has
four
still
to
do
and
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that
he
will
return
tonight
and
complete
the
job
excellent
i
cried
we
will
keep
our
own
secret
and
say
nothing
either
to
the
police
or
to
simpson
will
you
join
me
with
the
utmost
pleasure
said
i
and
so
it
was
agreed
it
was
ten
o'clock
that
night
when
i
returned
to
the
belmore
street
museum
mortimer
was
as
i
could
see
in
a
state
of
suppressed
nervous
excitement
but
it
was
still
too
early
to
begin
our
vigil
so
we
remained
for
an
hour
or
so
in
his
chambers
discussing
all
the
possibilities
of
the
singular
business
which
we
had
met
to
solve
at
last
the
roaring
stream
of
hansom
cabs
and
the
rush
of
hurrying
feet
became
lower
and
more
intermittent
as
the
pleasure-seekers
passed
on
their
way
to
their
stations
or
their
homes
it
was
nearly
twelve
when
mortimer
led
the
way
to
the
lumber-room
which
overlooked
the
central
hall
of
the
museum
he
had
visited
it
during
the
day
and
had
spread
some
sacking
so
that
we
could
lie
at
our
ease
and
look
straight
down
into
the
museum
the
skylight
was
of
unfrosted
glass
but
was
so
covered
with
dust
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
anyone
looking
up
from
below
to
detect
that
he
was
overlooked
we
cleared
a
small
piece
at
each
corner
which
gave
us
a
complete
view
of
the
room
beneath
us
in
the
cold
white
light
of
the
electric
lamps
everything
stood
out
hard
and
clear
and
i
could
see
the
smallest
detail
of
the
contents
of
the
various
cases
such
a
vigil
is
an
excellent
lesson
since
one
has
no
choice
but
to
look
hard
at
those
objects
which
we
usually
pass
with
such
half-hearted
interest
through
my
little
peep
hole
i
employed
the
hours
in
studying
every
specimen
from
the
huge
mummy-case
which
leaned
against
the
wall
to
those
very
jewels
which
had
brought
us
there
gleaming
and
sparkling
in
their
glass
case
immediately
beneath
us
there
was
much
precious
gold-work
and
many
valuable
stones
scattered
through
the
numerous
cases
but
those
wonderful
twelve
which
made
up
the
urim
and
thummim
glowed
and
burned
with
a
radiance
which
far
eclipsed
the
others
i
studied
in
turn
the
tomb-pictures
of
sicara
the
friezes
from
karnak
the
statues
of
memphis
and
the
inscriptions
of
thebes
but
my
eyes
would
always
come
back
to
that
wonderful
jewish
relic
and
my
mind
to
the
singular
mystery
which
surrounded
it
i
was
lost
in
the
thought
of
it
when
my
companion
suddenly
drew
his
breath
sharply
in
and
seized
my
arm
in
a
convulsive
grip
at
the
same
instant
i
saw
what
it
was
which
had
excited
him
i
have
said
that
against
the
wall--on
the
right-hand
side
of
the
doorway
the
right-hand
side
as
we
looked
at
it
but
the
left
as
one
entered--there
stood
a
large
mummy-case
to
our
unutterable
amazement
it
was
slowly
opening
gradually
gradually
the
lid
was
swinging
back
and
the
black
slit
which
marked
the
opening
was
becoming
wider
and
wider
so
gently
and
carefully
was
it
done
that
the
movement
was
almost
imperceptible
then
as
we
breathlessly
watched
it
a
white
thin
hand
appeared
at
the
opening
pushing
back
the
painted
lid
then
another
hand
and
finally
a
face--a
face
which
was
familiar
to
us
both
that
of
professor
andreas
stealthily
he
slunk
out
of
the
mummy-case
like
a
fox
stealing
from
its
burrow
his
head
turning
incessantly
to
left
and
to
right
stepping
then
pausing
then
stepping
again
the
very
image
of
craft
and
of
caution
once
some
sound
in
the
street
struck
him
motionless
and
he
stood
listening
with
his
ear
turned
ready
to
dart
back
to
the
shelter
behind
him
then
he
crept
onwards
again
upon
tiptoe
very
very
softly
and
slowly
until
he
had
reached
the
case
in
the
centre
of
the
room
there
he
took
a
bunch
of
keys
from
his
pocket
unlocked
the
case
took
out
the
jewish
breastplate
and
laying
it
upon
the
glass
in
front
of
him
began
to
work
upon
it
with
some
sort
of
small
glistening
tool
he
was
so
directly
underneath
us
that
his
bent
head
covered
his
work
but
we
could
guess
from
the
movement
of
his
hand
that
he
was
engaged
in
finishing
the
strange
disfigurement
which
he
had
begun
i
could
realize
from
the
heavy
breathing
of
my
companion
and
the
twitchings
of
the
hand
which
still
clutched
my
wrist
the
furious
indignation
which
filled
his
heart
as
he
saw
this
vandalism
in
the
quarter
of
all
others
where
he
could
least
have
expected
it
he
the
very
man
who
a
fortnight
before
had
reverently
bent
over
this
unique
relic
and
who
had
impressed
its
antiquity
and
its
sanctity
upon
us
was
now
engaged
in
this
outrageous
profanation
it
was
impossible
unthinkable--and
yet
there
in
the
white
glare
of
the
electric
light
beneath
us
was
that
dark
figure
with
the
bent
grey
head
and
the
twitching
elbow
what
inhuman
hypocrisy
what
hateful
depth
of
malice
against
his
successor
must
underlie
these
sinister
nocturnal
labours
it
was
painful
to
think
of
and
dreadful
to
watch
even
i
who
had
none
of
the
acute
feelings
of
a
virtuoso
could
not
bear
to
look
on
and
see
this
deliberate
mutilation
of
so
ancient
a
relic
it
was
a
relief
to
me
when
my
companion
tugged
at
my
sleeve
as
a
signal
that
i
was
to
follow
him
as
he
softly
crept
out
of
the
room
it
was
not
until
we
were
within
his
own
quarters
that
he
opened
his
lips
and
then
i
saw
by
his
agitated
face
how
deep
was
his
consternation
the
abominable
goth
he
cried
could
you
have
believed
it
it
is
amazing
he
is
a
villain
or
a
lunatic--one
or
the
other
we
shall
very
soon
see
which
come
with
me
jackson
and
we
shall
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
black
business
a
door
opened
out
of
the
passage
which
was
the
private
entrance
from
his
rooms
into
the
museum
this
he
opened
softly
with
his
key
having
first
kicked
off
his
shoes
an
example
which
i
followed
we
crept
together
through
room
after
room
until
the
large
hall
lay
before
us
with
that
dark
figure
still
stooping
and
working
at
the
central
case
with
an
advance
as
cautious
as
his
own
we
closed
in
upon
him
but
softly
as
we
went
we
could
not
take
him
entirely
unawares
we
were
still
a
dozen
yards
from
him
when
he
looked
round
with
a
start
and
uttering
a
husky
cry
of
terror
ran
frantically
down
the
museum
simpson
simpson
roared
mortimer
and
far
away
down
the
vista
of
electric
lighted
doors
we
saw
the
stiff
figure
of
the
old
soldier
suddenly
appear
professor
andreas
saw
him
also
and
stopped
running
with
a
gesture
of
despair
at
the
same
instant
we
each
laid
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
yes
yes
gentlemen
he
panted
i
will
come
with
you
to
your
room
mr
ward
mortimer
if
you
please
i
feel
that
i
owe
you
an
explanation
my
companion's
indignation
was
so
great
that
i
could
see
that
he
dared
not
trust
himself
to
reply
we
walked
on
each
side
of
the
old
professor
the
astonished
commissionaire
bringing
up
the
rear
when
we
reached
the
violated
case
mortimer
stopped
and
examined
the
breastplate
already
one
of
the
stones
of
the
lower
row
had
had
its
setting
turned
back
in
the
same
manner
as
the
others
my
friend
held
it
up
and
glanced
furiously
at
his
prisoner
how
could
you
he
cried
how
could
you
it
is
horrible--horrible
said
the
professor
i
don't
wonder
at
your
feelings
take
me
to
your
room
but
this
shall
not
be
left
exposed
cried
mortimer
he
picked
the
breastplate
up
and
carried
it
tenderly
in
his
hand
while
i
walked
beside
the
professor
like
a
policeman
with
a
malefactor
we
passed
into
mortimer's
chambers
leaving
the
amazed
old
soldier
to
understand
matters
as
best
he
could
the
professor
sat
down
in
mortimer's
arm-chair
and
turned
so
ghastly
a
colour
that
for
the
instant
all
our
resentment
was
changed
to
concern
a
stiff
glass
of
brandy
brought
the
life
back
to
him
once
more
there
i
am
better
now
said
he
these
last
few
days
have
been
too
much
for
me
i
am
convinced
that
i
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
it
is
a
nightmare--a
horrible
nightmare--that
i
should
be
arrested
as
a
burglar
in
what
has
been
for
so
long
my
own
museum
and
yet
i
cannot
blame
you
you
could
not
have
done
otherwise
my
hope
always
was
that
i
should
get
it
all
over
before
i
was
detected
this
would
have
been
my
last
night's
work
how
did
you
get
in
asked
mortimer
by
taking
a
very
great
liberty
with
your
private
door
but
the
object
justified
it
the
object
justified
everything
you
will
not
be
angry
when
you
know
everything--at
least
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
i
had
a
key
to
your
side
door
and
also
to
the
museum
door
i
did
not
give
them
up
when
i
left
and
so
you
see
it
was
not
difficult
for
me
to
let
myself
into
the
museum
i
used
to
come
in
early
before
the
crowd
had
cleared
from
the
street
then
i
hid
myself
in
the
mummy-case
and
took
refuge
there
whenever
simpson
came
round
i
could
always
hear
him
coming
i
used
to
leave
in
the
same
way
as
i
came
you
ran
a
risk
i
had
to
but
why
what
on
earth
was
your
object--you
to
do
a
thing
like
that
mortimer
pointed
reproachfully
at
the
plate
which
lay
before
him
on
the
table
i
could
devise
no
other
means
i
thought
and
thought
but
there
was
no
alternate
except
a
hideous
public
scandal
and
a
private
sorrow
which
would
have
clouded
our
lives
i
acted
for
the
best
incredible
as
it
may
seem
to
you
and
i
only
ask
your
attention
to
enable
me
to
prove
it
i
will
hear
what
you
have
to
say
before
i
take
any
further
steps
said
mortimer
grimly
i
am
determined
to
hold
back
nothing
and
to
take
you
both
completely
into
my
confidence
i
will
leave
it
to
your
own
generosity
how
far
you
will
use
the
facts
with
which
i
supply
you
we
have
the
essential
facts
already
and
yet
you
understand
nothing
let
me
go
back
to
what
passed
a
few
weeks
ago
and
i
will
make
it
all
clear
to
you
believe
me
that
what
i
say
is
the
absolute
and
exact
truth
you
have
met
the
person
who
calls
himself
captain
wilson
i
say
'calls
himself'
because
i
have
reason
now
to
believe
that
it
is
not
his
correct
name
it
would
take
me
too
long
if
i
were
to
describe
all
the
means
by
which
he
obtained
an
introduction
to
me
and
ingratiated
himself
into
my
friendship
and
the
affection
of
my
daughter
he
brought
letters
from
foreign
colleagues
which
compelled
me
to
show
him
some
attention
and
then
by
his
own
attainments
which
are
considerable
he
succeeded
in
making
himself
a
very
welcome
visitor
at
my
rooms
when
i
learned
that
my
daughter's
affections
had
been
gained
by
him
i
may
have
thought
it
premature
but
i
certainly
was
not
surprised
for
he
had
a
charm
of
manner
and
of
conversation
which
would
have
made
him
conspicuous
in
any
society
he
was
much
interested
in
oriental
antiquities
and
his
knowledge
of
the
subject
justified
his
interest
often
when
he
spent
the
evening
with
us
he
would
ask
permission
to
go
down
into
the
museum
and
have
an
opportunity
of
privately
inspecting
the
various
specimens
you
can
imagine
that
i
as
an
enthusiast
was
in
sympathy
with
such
a
request
and
that
i
felt
no
surprise
at
the
constancy
of
his
visits
after
his
actual
engagement
to
elise
there
was
hardly
an
evening
which
he
did
not
pass
with
us
and
an
hour
or
two
were
generally
devoted
to
the
museum
he
had
the
free
run
of
the
place
and
when
i
have
been
away
for
the
evening
i
had
no
objection
to
his
doing
whatever
he
wished
here
this
state
of
things
was
only
terminated
by
the
fact
of
my
resignation
of
my
official
duties
and
my
retirement
to
norwood
where
i
hoped
to
have
the
leisure
to
write
a
considerable
work
which
i
had
planned
it
was
immediately
after
this--within
a
week
or
so--that
i
first
realized
the
true
nature
and
character
of
the
man
whom
i
had
so
imprudently
introduced
into
my
family
the
discovery
came
to
me
through
letters
from
my
friends
abroad
which
showed
me
that
his
introductions
to
me
had
been
forgeries
aghast
at
the
revelation
i
asked
myself
what
motive
this
man
could
originally
have
had
in
practising
this
elaborate
deception
upon
me
i
was
too
poor
a
man
for
any
fortune-hunter
to
have
marked
me
down
why
then
had
he
come
i
remembered
that
some
of
the
most
precious
gems
in
europe
had
been
under
my
charge
and
i
remembered
also
the
ingenious
excuses
by
which
this
man
had
made
himself
familiar
with
the
cases
in
which
they
were
kept
he
was
a
rascal
who
was
planning
some
gigantic
robbery
how
could
i
without
striking
my
own
daughter
who
was
infatuated
about
him
prevent
him
from
carrying
out
any
plan
which
he
might
have
formed
my
device
was
a
clumsy
one
and
yet
i
could
think
of
nothing
more
effective
if
i
had
written
a
letter
under
my
own
name
you
would
naturally
have
turned
to
me
for
details
which
i
did
not
wish
to
give
i
resorted
to
an
anonymous
letter
begging
you
to
be
upon
your
guard
i
may
tell
you
that
my
change
from
belmore
street
to
norwood
had
not
affected
the
visits
of
this
man
who
had
i
believe
a
real
and
overpowering
affection
for
my
daughter
as
to
her
i
could
not
have
believed
that
any
woman
could
be
so
completely
under
the
influence
of
a
man
as
she
was
his
stronger
nature
seemed
to
entirely
dominate
her
i
had
not
realized
how
far
this
was
the
case
or
the
extent
of
the
confidence
which
existed
between
them
until
that
very
evening
when
his
true
character
for
the
first
time
was
made
clear
to
me
i
had
given
orders
that
when
he
called
he
should
be
shown
into
my
study
instead
of
to
the
drawing-room
there
i
told
him
bluntly
that
i
knew
all
about
him
that
i
had
taken
steps
to
defeat
his
designs
and
that
neither
i
nor
my
daughter
desired
ever
to
see
him
again
i
added
that
i
thanked
god
that
i
had
found
him
out
before
he
had
time
to
harm
those
precious
objects
which
it
had
been
the
work
of
my
life-time
to
protect
he
was
certainly
a
man
of
iron
nerve
he
took
my
remarks
without
a
sign
either
of
surprise
or
of
defiance
but
listened
gravely
and
attentively
until
i
had
finished
then
he
walked
across
the
room
without
a
word
and
struck
the
bell
'ask
miss
andreas
to
be
so
kind
as
to
step
this
way'
said
he
to
the
servant
my
daughter
entered
and
the
man
closed
the
door
behind
her
then
he
took
her
hand
in
his
'elise'
said
he
'your
father
has
just
discovered
that
i
am
a
villain
he
knows
now
what
you
knew
before'
she
stood
in
silence
listening
'he
says
that
we
are
to
part
for
ever'
said
he
she
did
not
withdraw
her
hand
'will
you
be
true
to
me
or
will
you
remove
the
last
good
influence
which
is
ever
likely
to
come
into
my
life'
'john'
she
cried
passionately
'i
will
never
abandon
you
never
never
not
if
the
whole
world
were
against
you'
in
vain
i
argued
and
pleaded
with
her
it
was
absolutely
useless
her
whole
life
was
bound
up
in
this
man
before
me
my
daughter
gentlemen
is
all
that
i
have
left
to
love
and
it
filled
me
with
agony
when
i
saw
how
powerless
i
was
to
save
her
from
her
ruin
my
helplessness
seemed
to
touch
this
man
who
was
the
cause
of
my
trouble
'it
may
not
be
as
bad
as
you
think
sir'
said
he
in
his
quiet
inflexible
way
'i
love
elise
with
a
love
which
is
strong
enough
to
rescue
even
one
who
has
such
a
record
as
i
have
it
was
but
yesterday
that
i
promised
her
that
never
again
in
my
whole
life
would
i
do
a
thing
of
which
she
should
be
ashamed
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
it
and
never
yet
did
i
make
up
my
mind
to
a
thing
which
i
did
not
do'
he
spoke
with
an
air
which
carried
conviction
with
it
as
he
concluded
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
he
drew
out
a
small
cardboard
box
'i
am
about
to
give
you
a
proof
of
my
determination'
said
he
'this
elise
shall
be
the
first-fruits
of
your
redeeming
influence
over
me
you
are
right
sir
in
thinking
that
i
had
designs
upon
the
jewels
in
your
possession
such
ventures
have
had
a
charm
for
me
which
depended
as
much
upon
the
risk
run
as
upon
the
value
of
the
prize
those
famous
and
antique
stones
of
the
jewish
priest
were
a
challenge
to
my
daring
and
my
ingenuity
i
determined
to
get
them'
'i
guessed
as
much'
'there
was
only
one
thing
that
you
did
not
guess'
'and
what
is
that'
'that
i
got
them
they
are
in
this
box'
he
opened
the
box
and
tilted
out
the
contents
upon
the
corner
of
my
desk
my
hair
rose
and
my
flesh
grew
cold
as
i
looked
there
were
twelve
magnificent
square
stones
engraved
with
mystical
characters
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
they
were
the
jewels
of
the
urim
and
thummim
'good
god'
i
cried
'how
have
you
escaped
discovery'
'by
the
substitution
of
twelve
others
made
especially
to
my
order
in
which
the
originals
are
so
carefully
imitated
that
i
defy
the
eye
to
detect
the
difference'
'then
the
present
stones
are
false'
i
cried
'they
have
been
for
some
weeks'
we
all
stood
in
silence
my
daughter
white
with
emotion
but
still
holding
this
man
by
the
hand
'you
see
what
i
am
capable
of
elise'
said
he
'i
see
that
you
are
capable
of
repentance
and
restitution'
she
answered
'yes
thanks
to
your
influence
i
leave
the
stones
in
your
hands
sir
do
what
you
like
about
it
but
remember
that
whatever
you
do
against
me
is
done
against
the
future
husband
of
your
only
daughter
you
will
hear
from
me
soon
again
elise
it
is
the
last
time
that
i
will
ever
cause
pain
to
your
tender
heart'
and
with
these
words
he
left
both
the
room
and
the
house
my
position
was
a
dreadful
one
here
i
was
with
these
precious
relics
in
my
possession
and
how
could
i
return
them
without
a
scandal
and
an
exposure
i
knew
the
depth
of
my
daughter's
nature
too
well
to
suppose
that
i
would
ever
be
able
to
detach
her
from
this
man
now
that
she
had
entirely
given
him
her
heart
i
was
not
even
sure
how
far
it
was
right
to
detach
her
if
she
had
such
an
ameliorating
influence
over
him
how
could
i
expose
him
without
injuring
her--and
how
far
was
i
justified
in
exposing
him
when
he
had
voluntarily
put
himself
into
my
power
i
thought
and
thought
until
at
last
i
formed
a
resolution
which
may
seem
to
you
to
be
a
foolish
one
and
yet
if
i
had
to
do
it
again
i
believe
it
would
be
the
best
course
open
to
me
my
idea
was
to
return
the
stones
without
anyone
being
the
wiser
with
my
keys
i
could
get
into
the
museum
at
any
time
and
i
was
confident
that
i
could
avoid
simpson
whose
hours
and
methods
were
familiar
to
me
i
determined
to
take
no
one
into
my
confidence--not
even
my
daughter--whom
i
told
that
i
was
about
to
visit
my
brother
in
scotland
i
wanted
a
free
hand
for
a
few
nights
without
inquiry
as
to
my
comings
and
goings
to
this
end
i
took
a
room
in
harding
street
that
very
night
with
an
intimation
that
i
was
a
pressman
and
that
i
should
keep
very
late
hours
that
night
i
made
my
way
into
the
museum
and
i
replaced
four
of
the
stones
it
was
hard
work
and
took
me
all
night
when
simpson
came
round
i
always
heard
his
footsteps
and
concealed
myself
in
the
mummy-case
i
had
some
knowledge
of
gold-work
but
was
far
less
skilful
than
the
thief
had
been
he
had
replaced
the
setting
so
exactly
that
i
defy
anyone
to
see
the
difference
my
work
was
rude
and
clumsy
however
i
hoped
that
the
plate
might
not
be
carefully
examined
or
the
roughness
of
the
setting
observed
until
my
task
was
done
next
night
i
replaced
four
more
stones
and
tonight
i
should
have
finished
my
task
had
it
not
been
for
the
unfortunate
circumstance
which
has
caused
me
to
reveal
so
much
which
i
should
have
wished
to
keep
concealed
i
appeal
to
you
gentlemen
to
your
sense
of
honour
and
of
compassion
whether
what
i
have
told
you
should
go
any
farther
or
not
my
own
happiness
my
daughter's
future
the
hopes
of
this
man's
regeneration
all
depend
upon
your
decision
which
is
said
my
friend
that
all
is
well
that
ends
well
and
that
the
whole
matter
ends
here
and
at
once
tomorrow
the
loose
settings
shall
be
tightened
by
an
expert
goldsmith
and
so
passes
the
greatest
danger
to
which
since
the
destruction
of
the
temple

thummim
has
been
exposed
here
is
my
hand
professor
andreas
and
i
can
only
hope
that
under
such
difficult
circumstances
i
should
have
carried
myself
as
unselfishly
and
as
well
just
one
footnote
to
this
narrative
within
a
month
elise
andreas
was
married
to
a
man
whose
name
had
i
the
indiscretion
to
mention
it
would
appeal
to
my
readers
as
one
who
is
now
widely
and
deservedly
honoured
but
if
the
truth
were
known
that
honour
is
due
not
to
him
but
to
the
gentle
girl
who
plucked
him
back
when
he
had
gone
so

dark
