the
thousand
injuries
of
fortunato
i
had
borne
as
i
best
could
but
when
he
ventured
upon
insult
i
vowed
revenge
you
who
so
well
know
the
nature
of
my
soul
will
not
suppose
however
that
i
gave
utterance
to
a
threat
at
length
i
would
be
avenged
this
was
a
point
definitely
settled--but
the
very
definitiveness
with
which
it
was
resolved
precluded
the
idea
of
risk
i
must
not
only
punish
but
punish
with
impunity
a
wrong
is
unredressed
when
retribution
overtakes
its
redresser
it
is
equally
unredressed
when
the
avenger
fails
to
make
himself
felt
as
such
to
him
who
has
done
the
wrong
it
must
be
understood
that
neither
by
word
nor
deed
had
i
given
fortunato
cause
to
doubt
my
good
will
i
continued
as
was
my
wont
to
smile
in
his
face
and
he
did
not
perceive
that
my
smile
now
was
at
the
thought
of
his
immolation
he
had
a
weak
point--this
fortunato--although
in
other
regards
he
was
a
man
to
be
respected
and
even
feared
he
prided
himself
on
his
connoisseurship
in
wine
few
italians
have
the
true
virtuoso
spirit
for
the
most
part
their
enthusiasm
is
adopted
to
suit
the
time
and
opportunity--to
practise
imposture
upon
the
british
and
austrian
millionaires
in
painting
and
gemmary
fortunato
like
his
countrymen
was
a
quack--but
in
the
matter
of
old
wines
he
was
sincere
in
this
respect
i
did
not
differ
from
him
materially
i
was
skillful
in
the
italian
vintages
myself
and
bought
largely
whenever
i
could
it
was
about
dusk
one
evening
during
the
supreme
madness
of
the
carnival
season
that
i
encountered
my
friend
he
accosted
me
with
excessive
warmth
for
he
had
been
drinking
much
the
man
wore
motley
he
had
on
a
tight-fitting
parti-striped
dress
and
his
head
was
surmounted
by
the
conical
cap
and
bells
i
was
so
pleased
to
see
him
that
i
thought
i
should
never
have
done
wringing
his
hand
i
said
to
him--my
dear
fortunato
you
are
luckily
met
how
remarkably
well
you
are
looking
to-day
but
i
have
received
a
pipe
of
what
passes
for
amontillado
and
i
have
my
doubts
how
said
he
amontillado
a
pipe
impossible
and
in
the
middle
of
the
carnival
i
have
my
doubts
i
replied
and
i
was
silly
enough
to
pay
the
full
amontillado
price
without
consulting
you
in
the
matter
you
were
not
to
be
found
and
i
was
fearful
of
losing
a
bargain
amontillado
i
have
my
doubts
amontillado
and
i
must
satisfy
them
amontillado
as
you
are
engaged
i
am
on
my
way
to
luchesi
if
any
one
has
a
critical
turn
it
is
he
he
will
tell
me--
luchesi
cannot
tell
amontillado
from
sherry
and
yet
some
fools
will
have
it
that
his
taste
is
a
match
for
your
own
come
let
us
go
whither
to
your
vaults
my
friend
no
i
will
not
impose
upon
your
good
nature
i
perceive
you
have
an
engagement
luchesi--
i
have
no
engagement--come
my
friend
no
it
is
not
the
engagement
but
the
severe
cold
with
which
i
perceive
you
are
afflicted
the
vaults
are
insufferably
damp
they
are
encrusted
with
nitre
let
us
go
nevertheless
the
cold
is
merely
nothing
amontillado
you
have
been
imposed
upon
and
as
for
luchesi
he
cannot
distinguish
sherry
from
amontillado
thus
speaking
fortunato
possessed
himself
of
my
arm
putting
on
a
mask
of
black
silk
and
drawing
a
roquelaire
closely
about
my
person
i
suffered
him
to
hurry
me
to
my
palazzo
there
were
no
attendants
at
home
they
had
absconded
to
make
merry
in
honour
of
the
time
i
had
told
them
that
i
should
not
return
until
the
morning
and
had
given
them
explicit
orders
not
to
stir
from
the
house
these
orders
were
sufficient
i
well
knew
to
insure
their
immediate
disappearance
one
and
all
as
soon
as
my
back
was
turned
i
took
from
their
sconces
two
flambeaux
and
giving
one
to
fortunato
bowed
him
through
several
suites
of
rooms
to
the
archway
that
led
into
the
vaults
i
passed
down
a
long
and
winding
staircase
requesting
him
to
be
cautious
as
he
followed
we
came
at
length
to
the
foot
of
the
descent
and
stood
together
on
the
damp
ground
of
the
catacombs
of
the
montresors
the
gait
of
my
friend
was
unsteady
and
the
bells
upon
his
cap
jingled
as
he
strode
the
pipe
said
he
it
is
farther
on
said
i
but
observe
the
white
web-work
which
gleams
from
these
cavern
walls
he
turned
towards
me
and
looked
into
my
eyes
with
two
filmy
orbs
that
distilled
the
rheum
of
intoxication
nitre
he
asked
at
length
nitre
i
replied
how
long
have
you
had
that
cough
ugh
ugh
ugh--ugh
ugh
ugh--ugh
ugh
ugh--ugh
ugh
ugh--ugh
ugh
ugh
my
poor
friend
found
it
impossible
to
reply
for
many
minutes
it
is
nothing
he
said
at
last
come
i
said
with
decision
we
will
go
back
your
health
is
precious
you
are
rich
respected
admired
beloved
you
are
happy
as
once
i
was
you
are
a
man
to
be
missed
for
me
it
is
no
matter
we
will
go
back
you
will
be
ill
and
i
cannot
be
responsible
besides
there
is
luchesi--
enough
he
said
the
cough
is
a
mere
nothing
it
will
not
kill
me
i
shall
not
die
of
a
cough
true--true
i
replied
and
indeed
i
had
no
intention
of
alarming
you
unnecessarily--but
you
should
use
all
proper
caution
a
draught
of
this
medoc
will
defend
us
from
the
damps
here
i
knocked
off
the
neck
of
a
bottle
which
i
drew
from
a
long
row
of
its
fellows
that
lay
upon
the
mould
drink
i
said
presenting
him
the
wine
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
with
a
leer
he
paused
and
nodded
to
me
familiarly
while
his
bells
jingled
i
drink
he
said
to
the
buried
that
repose
around
us
and
i
to
your
long
life
he
again
took
my
arm
and
we
proceeded
these
vaults
he
said
are
extensive
the
montresors
i
replied
were
a
great
and
numerous
family
i
forget
your
arms
a
huge
human
foot
d'or
in
a
field
azure
the
foot
crushes
a
serpent
rampant
whose
fangs
are
imbedded
in
the
heel
and
the
motto
nemo
me
impune
lacessit
good
he
said
the
wine
sparkled
in
his
eyes
and
the
bells
jingled
my
own
fancy
grew
warm
with
the
medoc
we
had
passed
through
walls
of
piled
bones
with
casks
and
puncheons
intermingling
into
the
inmost
recesses
of
catacombs
i
paused
again
and
this
time
i
made
bold
to
seize
fortunato
by
an
arm
above
the
elbow
the
nitre
i
said
see
it
increases
it
hangs
like
moss
upon
the
vaults
we
are
below
the
river's
bed
the
drops
of
moisture
trickle
among
the
bones
come
we
will
go
back
ere
it
is
too
late
your
cough--
it
is
nothing
he
said
let
us
go
on
but
first
another
draught
of
the
medoc
i
broke
and
reached
him
a
flagon
of
de
grave
he
emptied
it
at
a
breath
his
eyes
flashed
with
a
fierce
light
he
laughed
and
threw
the
bottle
upwards
with
a
gesticulation
i
did
not
understand
i
looked
at
him
in
surprise
he
repeated
the
movement--a
grotesque
one
you
do
not
comprehend
he
said
not
i
i
replied
then
you
are
not
of
the
brotherhood
how
you
are
not
of
the
masons
yes
yes
i
said
yes
yes
you
impossible
a
mason
a
mason
i
replied
a
sign
he
said
a
sign
it
is
this
i
answered
producing
a
trowel
from
beneath
the
folds
of
my
roquelaire
you
jest
he
exclaimed
recoiling
a
few
paces
but
let
us
proceed
to
the
amontillado
be
it
so
i
said
replacing
the
tool
beneath
the
cloak
and
again
offering
him
my
arm
he
leaned
upon
it
heavily
we
continued
our
route
in
search
of
the
amontillado
we
passed
through
a
range
of
low
arches
descended
passed
on
and
descending
again
arrived
at
a
deep
crypt
in
which
the
foulness
of
the
air
caused
our
flambeaux
rather
to
glow
than
flame
at
the
most
remote
end
of
the
crypt
there
appeared
another
less
spacious
its
walls
had
been
lined
with
human
remains
piled
to
the
vault
overhead
in
the
fashion
of
the
great
catacombs
of
paris
three
sides
of
this
interior
crypt
were
still
ornamented
in
this
manner
from
the
fourth
side
the
bones
had
been
thrown
down
and
lay
promiscuously
upon
the
earth
forming
at
one
point
a
mound
of
some
size
within
the
wall
thus
exposed
by
the
displacing
of
the
bones
we
perceived
a
still
interior
recess
in
depth
about
four
feet
in
width
three
in
height
six
or
seven
it
seemed
to
have
been
constructed
for
no
especial
use
within
itself
but
formed
merely
the
interval
between
two
of
the
colossal
supports
of
the
roof
of
the
catacombs
and
was
backed
by
one
of
their
circumscribing
walls
of
solid
granite
it
was
in
vain
that
fortunato
uplifting
his
dull
torch
endeavoured
to
pry
into
the
depth
of
the
recess
its
termination
the
feeble
light
did
not
enable
us
to
see
proceed
i
said
herein
is
the
amontillado
as
for
luchesi--
he
is
an
ignoramus
interrupted
my
friend
as
he
stepped
unsteadily
forward
while
i
followed
immediately
at
his
heels
in
an
instant
he
had
reached
the
extremity
of
the
niche
and
finding
his
progress
arrested
by
the
rock
stood
stupidly
bewildered
a
moment
more
and
i
had
fettered
him
to
the
granite
in
its
surface
were
two
iron
staples
distant
from
each
other
about
two
feet
horizontally
from
one
of
these
depended
a
short
chain
from
the
other
a
padlock
throwing
the
links
about
his
waist
it
was
but
the
work
of
a
few
seconds
to
secure
it
he
was
too
much
astounded
to
resist
withdrawing
the
key
i
stepped
back
from
the
recess
pass
your
hand
i
said
over
the
wall
you
cannot
help
feeling
the
nitre
indeed
it
is
very
damp
once
more
let
me
implore
you
to
return
no
then
i
must
positively
leave
you
but
i
must
first
render
you
all
the
little
attentions
in
my
power
the
amontillado
ejaculated
my
friend
not
yet
recovered
from
his
astonishment
true
i
replied
the
amontillado
as
i
said
these
words
i
busied
myself
among
the
pile
of
bones
of
which
i
have
before
spoken
throwing
them
aside
i
soon
uncovered
a
quantity
of
building
stone
and
mortar
with
these
materials
and
with
the
aid
of
my
trowel
i
began
vigorously
to
wall
up
the
entrance
of
the
niche
i
had
scarcely
laid
the
first
tier
of
the
masonry
when
i
discovered
that
the
intoxication
of
fortunato
had
in
a
great
measure
worn
off
the
earliest
indication
i
had
of
this
was
a
low
moaning
cry
from
the
depth
of
the
recess
it
was
not
the
cry
of
a
drunken
man
there
was
then
a
long
and
obstinate
silence
i
laid
the
second
tier
and
the
third
and
the
fourth
and
then
i
heard
the
furious
vibrations
of
the
chain
the
noise
lasted
for
several
minutes
during
which
that
i
might
hearken
to
it
with
the
more
satisfaction
i
ceased
my
labours
and
sat
down
upon
the
bones
when
at
last
the
clanking
subsided
i
resumed
the
trowel
and
finished
without
interruption
the
fifth
the
sixth
and
the
seventh
tier
the
wall
was
now
nearly
upon
a
level
with
my
breast
i
again
paused
and
holding
the
flambeaux
over
the
mason-work
threw
a
few
feeble
rays
upon
the
figure
within
a
succession
of
loud
and
shrill
screams
bursting
suddenly
from
the
throat
of
the
chained
form
seemed
to
thrust
me
violently
back
for
a
brief
moment
i
hesitated--i
trembled
unsheathing
my
rapier
i
began
to
grope
with
it
about
the
recess
but
the
thought
of
an
instant
reassured
me
i
placed
my
hand
upon
the
solid
fabric
of
the
catacombs
and
felt
satisfied
i
reapproached
the
wall
i
replied
to
the
yells
of
him
who
clamoured
i
re-echoed--i
aided--i
surpassed
them
in
volume
and
in
strength
i
did
this
and
the
clamourer
grew
still
it
was
now
midnight
and
my
task
was
drawing
to
a
close
i
had
completed
the
eighth
the
ninth
and
the
tenth
tier
i
had
finished
a
portion
of
the
last
and
the
eleventh
there
remained
but
a
single
stone
to
be
fitted
and
plastered
in
i
struggled
with
its
weight
i
placed
it
partially
in
its
destined
position
but
now
there
came
from
out
the
niche
a
low
laugh
that
erected
the
hairs
upon
my
head
it
was
succeeded
by
a
sad
voice
which
i
had
difficulty
in
recognizing
as
that
of
the
noble
fortunato
the
voice
said--
ha
ha
ha--he
he
he--a
very
good
joke
indeed--an
excellent
jest
we
shall
have
many
a
rich
laugh
about
it
at
the
palazzo--he
he
he--over
our
wine--he
he
he
the
amontillado
i
said
he
he
he--he
he
he--yes
the
amontillado
but
is
it
not
getting
late
will
not
they
be
awaiting
us
at
the

the

fortunato
and
the
rest
let
us

yes
i
said
let
us
be
gone
for
the
love
of
god
montresor
yes
i
said
for
the
love
of
god
but
to
these
words
i
hearkened
in
vain
for
a
reply
i
grew
impatient
i
called
aloud--
fortunato
no
answer
i
called
again--
fortunato--
no
answer
still
i
thrust
a
torch
through
the
remaining
aperture
and
let
it
fall
within
there
came
forth
in
reply
only
a
jingling
of
the
bells
my
heart
grew
sick
on
account
of
the
dampness
of
the
catacombs
i
hastened
to
make
an
end
of
my
labour
i
forced
the
last
stone
into
its
position
i
