big
joe
merklos
was
the
first
of
them
he
appeared
at
the
wide
bend
national
bank
one
day
cash
in
hand
the
charm
of
him
his
flashing
smile
the
easy
strength
in
his
big
body
were
persuasive
recommendations
but
the
bank's
appraisal
scarcely
got
that
far
wasn't
he
the
first
buyer
in
fifteen
years
for
that
bone-yard
of
lonely
dreams
dark
valley
the
county
seat
of
wide
bend
presided
over
three
valleys
corresponding
to
the
forks
of
the
sallinook
river
once
dark
valley
had
been
the
richest
of
these
solid
houses
and
barns
stood
among
orchards
laden
with
fruit
fields
chock-full
of
heavy-bearded
grain

till
one
spring
the
middle
fork
of
the
river
had
dried
up
the
farmers
called
in
specialists
who
sank
wells
and
pilot
holes
measured
the
slopes
they
heard
much
talk
about
water
tables
about
springs
undercutting
rock
formations
but
when
it
was
done
the
fact
remained
dark
valley's
water
supply
was
choked
off
beyond
man's
ability
to
restore
it
in
the
end
the
farmers
gave
up
left
their
dusty
houses
and
shriveled
orchards
and
dark
valley
died
boys
hiked
over
there
occasionally
men
scouted
for
fence
posts
or
pipe
young
couples
passed
quickly
through
on
moonlight
nights
and
at
least
two
stubborn
old-timers
still
squatted
at
the
upper
end
now
that
joe
merklos
had
bought
it
of
course
they
would
have
to
move
well
won't
they
henderson
asked
jerry
bronson
looked
around
at
the
other
members
of
the
wide
bend
businessmen's
club
doesn't
take
a
lawyer
to
answer
that
hen
dam'
shame
said
caruso
the
barber
who
always
championed
underdogs
they've
had
no
equity
in
that
land
for
years
the
bank
just
let
them
stay
on
they
can
move
on
over
the
hill
jerry
nodded
maybe
somebody
ought
to
suggest
that
to
them
don't
look
at
me
caruso
said
those
old
coots
ain't
been
near
my
shop
for
years
when
the
chuckles
died
macallister
the
druggist
voiced
the
thought
that
rested
unspoken
on
all
their
minds
i
wonder
if
that
fellow
realizes
what
a
worthless
piece
of
land
he's
bought
he
looked
it
over
this
was
hammond
of
the
bank
'course
you
didn't
try
to
talk
him
out
of
it
would
you
have
hammond
retorted
indignantly
henderson
jabbed
the
air
with
his
cigar
i
think
he
was
a
coal
miner
back
east
saved
up
his
money
to
get
on
the
land
i
think
he's
a
gypsy
caruso
said
you
ought
to
know
tipton
the
grocer
laughed
caruso
got
fined
for
his
reply
and
with
the
tinkle
of
coins
in
the
luncheon
club
kitty
the
men
dispersed





joe
merklos'
relatives
arrived
that
night
henderson
who
told
jerry
bronson
about
it
had
made
an
early
morning
delivery
of
feed
nearby
and
driven
on
to
take
a
look
at
merklos'
purchase
from
the
ridge
he
viewed
dark
valley's
three
miles
of
width
and
six
or
so
of
length
figures
were
moving
about
the
gaunt
and
windowless
farm
buildings
at
least
one
plow
was
in
operation
and
the
good
blue
friendliness
of
smoke
arose
here
and
there
looked
like
a
lot
of
people
jerry
but
you
know--i
didn't
see
any
cars
or
trucks
around
jerry's
blue
eyes
crinkled
human
nature
didn't
like
puzzles
any
more
than
it
liked
strangers
he
returned
to
the
tedious
civil
case
he
was
working
on
about
three
o'clock
he
decided
he
was
tired
and
bored
enough
to
call
it
a
day
he
got
into
his
car
and
headed
for
dark
valley
aside
from
his
curiosity
he
thought
he
might
talk
to
the
two
old
squatters
at
the
far
end
the
carvers
were
independent
and
truculent
now
that
joe
merklos'
relatives
had
arrived
in
full
force
there
was
danger
of
a
clash
as
the
road
topped
the
ridge
it
left
green
fields
and
orchards
abruptly
behind
but
dark
valley
had
a
wild
sort
of
beauty
cupped
as
it
was
between
two
rows
of
hills
which
curved
together
as
higher
jumbled
foothills
to
the
west
jerry's
car
trailed
a
plume
of
dust
as
it
slid
down
to
the
dry
riverbed
he
made
a
left
turn
and
started
up
the
valley
road
at
the
first
farm
he
saw
dark
plump
women
in
billowing
dresses
wearing
peasant
scarves
over
their
heads
they
moved
about
the
barnyard
raking
dead
leaves
and
scratching
busily
at
the
baked
earth
of
the
old
truck
gardens
chickens
and
ducks
strayed
and
jerry
caught
a
glimpse
of
children
he
waved
to
the
group
and
was
answered
by
nods
and
flashing
smiles
then
he
had
a
shock
one
of
the
women
was
working
the
handle
of
a
pump
that
had
been
bone-dry
for
fifteen
years--and
a
slender
stream
of
clear
water
spilled
into
her
wooden
tub
somewhat
dazedly
jerry
drove
on
he
saw
more
of
the
merklos
people
at
other
farms
men
were
working
in
the
withered
orchards
new
fence
posts
and
rails
were
going
up
bright
axes
flashed
in
the
dry
and
scraggly
wood
lots
jerry's
thoughts
kept
returning
to
the
water
in
that
first
pump
could
it
be
that
they
had
learned
the
valley
had
a
supply
again
that
would
be
a
mighty
joke
on
hammond
and
the
first
national
bank
the
road
badly
rutted
by
erosion
and
drifted
over
with
sand
and
dry
leaves
began
to
rise
jerry
shifted
into
low
gear
then
suddenly
he
stopped
he'd
had
another
shock
he
had
just
realized
this
road
was
unused
he
recalled
the
twin
ruts
patterned
with
rabbit
and
bird
tracks
clear
back
to
the
turn-off
without
question
his
car
had
been
the
first
to
mark
the
road
since
winter
then
how
had
these
dozens
of
people
come
with
their
chickens
and
ducks
and
children
and
tools
he
had
seen
no
cars
no
wagons
no
carts
how
had
these
people
come
jerry
sat
back
in
the
seat
and
grinned
he
fished
out
his
tobacco
pouch
and
filled
his
pipe
there
were
times
when
he
considered
himself
fairly
mature
fairly
well
balanced
yet
he
was
as
ready
as
the
next
to
build
a
house
of
mystery
out
of
the
insubstantial
timber
of
ignorance
of
course
there
was
a
reasonable
explanation
they
must
have
walked
from
the
railroad
it
was
a
good
many
miles
but
it
was
perfectly
possible
feeling
better
jerry
followed
the
tortuous
road
to
the
western
crest
his
long
legs
hadn't
taken
him
far
from
the
car
when
he
heard
a
harsh
hold
up
first
one
then
the
other
carver
brother
stepped
out
from
a
scrub
oak
thicket--short
leathery
old
men
with
ragged
whiskers
and
dirt
seamed
into
their
faces
and
wrists
they
eyed
him
malevolently
over
raised
shotguns
came
to
talk
to
you
jerry
said
mildly
one
of
them--he
thought
it
was
ed--spat
ah
now
jerry
went
on
in
an
aggrieved
tone
that's
a
fine
way
to
treat
a
son
of
jack
bronson
the
carver
brothers
glanced
at
one
another
then
the
shotguns
lowered
come
along
they
said
gruffly
in
the
littered
yard
by
their
cabin
they
pointed
to
a
bench
and
squatted
down
before
it
on
their
thin
old
shanks
new
people
in
dark
valley
they
nodded
they've
bought
it
from
the
bank
they
own
it
clear
to
the
ridge
line
including
your
place
here
we
been
here
forty
years
said
ed
if
i
owned
it
you
could
stay
forty
more
they
send
you
the
voice
was
sharp
suspicious
jerry
shook
his
head
i
just
thought
you'd
like
to
know
about
it
for
a
couple
of
minutes
the
carver
brothers
chewed
tobacco
in
unison
they
stood
up
reached
for
their
guns
we'll
see
they
said
jerry
nodded
they
walked
beside
him
kicking
thoughtfully
at
the
leaves
the
brother
named
mike
rubbed
his
whiskers
get
much
of
a
look
at
'em
when
ye
passed
through
some
they
furriners
jerry
sighed
inwardly
maybe
they
look
like
hard
workers
the
carver
brothers
cackled
suddenly
they
better
be
to
farm
that
land
jerry
passed
back
through
the
valley
a
man
knocking
out
stumps
waved
to
him
a
woman
in
a
barnyard
swished
out
her
big
skirts
shooing
chickens
at
that
first
farm
a
trickle
of
water
still
ran
from
the
pump





wide
bend
was
a
normal
community
along
with
its
natural
curiosity
there
was
a
genuine
feeling
of
neighborliness--heightened
by
the
conviction
that
these
hardworking
strangers
had
thrown
their
money
away
on
a
hopeless
venture
so
one
way
and
another
a
fair
percentage
of
the
town's
population
found
excuses
in
the
next
few
days
to
get
out
to
dark
valley
bit
by
bit
the
reports
filtered
back
to
jerry
and
they
all
added
up
about
the
same
joe
merklos
and
his
people
were
incredibly
industrious
already
they
had
cleaned
up
the
yards
repaired
sagging
barns
and
roofless
sheds
curtains
fluttered
at
the
windows
cows
had
appeared
and
sheep
even
a
few
horses
somehow
perhaps
from
accumulated
seepage
they
were
still
bringing
water
from
the
rusty
pumps
and--though
it
was
surely
an
illusion--dark
valley
seemed
to
have
taken
on
a
tinge
of
green
again
wide
bend's
womenfolk
brought
gifts
of
home-made
preserves
jelly
canned
vegetables

and
came
away
puzzled
no
they
hadn't
been
badly
received
all
was
politeness
and
smiles
but
there
was--well
a
sort
of
remoteness
about
these
people
the
kids
went
out
of
sight
the
minute
you
turned
into
a
place
and
you
just
couldn't
get
close
to
the
grown-ups
dark
they
were
and
heavy-looking
they
smiled
a
lot
jabbering
in
an
unknown
language
they
had
beautiful
white
teeth
but
no
jewelry
or
ornaments
such
as
gypsies
might
wear
they
always
appeared
pleased
that
you
brought
them
something
but
on
the
way
home
you
discovered
you
still
had
your
presents
after
all
the
best
guess
as
to
the
number
in
the
tribe
somehow
that
seemed
the
best
way
to
describe
them
was
sixty
give
or
take
a
few
the
general
verdict
was
expressed
by
henderson
at
the
next
club
luncheon
they're
odd
but
they're
hard
workers
darned
good
thing
for
the
community
miller
the
jeweler
agreed
vigorously
self-interest
jerry
murmured
is
a
wonderful
thing
they
turned
on
him
they
haven't
bought
a
thing
from
us
and
what
if
they
did
kidding
boys
i've
got
something
to
sell
too
then
jerry
frowned
they
haven't
bought
anything
around
the
table
heads
shook
probably
caruso
growled
they
wear
their
hair
long
too
in
the
laughter
the
matter
was
forgotten
but
jerry
remembered
it
that
night
sitting
on
the
porch
of
his
house
there
must
be
hundreds
of
items--tools
and
nails
and
hinges
and
glass
and
wire
and
sandpaper
and
oil
and
rope
and
seed
and
salt
and
sugar--that
the
tribe
needed
how
could
they--
there
was
a
step
on
the
path
you
there
caruso
called
yep
the
barber
sat
in
the
other
chair
hoisted
his
feet
to
the
railing
you
know
how
kids
are
um
that
boy
of
mine
he
couldn't
stand
it
about
dark
valley
he
was
out
there
with
a
couple
of
pals
poking
around
yes
jerry
didn't
realize
his
voice
was
sharp
oh
no
trouble
but
the
middle
fork
of
the
river's
started
to
run
again





for
a
long
time
after
caruso
had
gone
jerry
sat
with
his
cold
pipe
in
his
mouth
there
were
reasonable
explanations
for
every
one
of
the
small
oddities
that
had
cropped
up
with
joe
merklos
and
his
people
but
he
couldn't
shake
a
growing
feeling
of
uneasiness
jerry
went
to
bed
muttering
for
he
was
a
man
trained
to
keep
emotion
and
fact
well
separate
but
the
feeling
was
still
with
him
when
he
awoke
and
he
recognized
it
later
on
henderson's
face
we
got
to
get
the
boys
together
and
talk
this
thing
over
the
feed
and
fuel
owner
said
what's
up
this
stuff
that's
missin'
jerry
gave
a
start
he
had
just
spent
at
least
half
an
hour
looking
for
this
garage
lock
every
day
of
this
week
henderson
went
on
heavily
i've
had
people
in
to
replace
some
little
thing
that
was
lost
hatchets
and
feeding
troughs
and
spare
parts
and
panes
of
glass
and
things
like
that
a
couple
of
old
chicken
brooders
that
was
stored
ten
salt
blocks
anderson
had
in
his
barn
just
then
macallister
stepped
over
from
his
drugstore
to
join
them
dammit
he
said
plaintively
dusting
off
his
store
jacket
i
been
in
the
basement
the
last
hour
looking
for
an
old
pipe
wrench
i
swear
i
left
it
there
jerry
met
henderson's
glance
all
right
he
said
let's
get
the
gang
together
for
lunch
today
sheriff
watson
joined
them
in
the
back
room
of
the
restaurant
when
the
coffee
came
jerry
rose
to
explain
the
purpose
of
the
meeting
our
problem
he
began
may
amount
to
nothing
at
all
or
it
could
turn
out
to
be
mighty
nasty
hen
and
i
thought
it
was
time
to
talk
it
over
briefly
he
recapitulated
dark
valley's
reawakening
he
described
joe
merklos
and
his
people--their
odd
clothing
their
independence
their
alien
language
point
one
he
said
most
people
don't
like
strangers
he
described
the
tribe's
arrival
without
cars
or
wagons
without
even
a
mark
on
the
abandoned
road
he
spoke
of
the
pumps
that
came
to
life
the
river
that
now
ran
again
the
progress
the
tribe
had
made
seemed
almost
beyond
human
capacity
point
two
jerry
said
most
people
don't
like
mysteries
he
turned
okay
hen
first
henderson
explained
that
none
of
the
tribe
had
bought
supplies
of
any
kind
in
wide
bend
he
got
corroboration
from
other
businessmen
present
then
as
he
summarized
the
missing
articles
heads
began
to
nod
faces
got
red
and
lists
were
clenched
jerry
got
to
his
feet
again
point
three
i
don't
need
to
spell
out
much
more
of
this
and
carloads
of
men
with
guns
will
be
heading
for
the
ridge
there'll
be
the
kind
of
trouble
we
don't
want
on
wide
bend's
conscience
should
we
let
'em
rob
us
blind
shouted
tipton
no
wonder
they
do
so
good
caruso
cried
how
about
the
water
hammond
asked
sarcastically
you
think
they
stole
that
too
someone
shouted
back
and
a
heated
discussion
raged
jerry
finally
banged
on
the
table
with
a
sugar
bowl
let's
hear
from
the
sheriff
watson
hoisted
his
big
frame
and
sighed
jerry's
right
boys
we
got
a
nasty
situation
building
up
right
now
my
old
woman's
so
mad
at
the
dark
valley
people
she
could
spit
and
why
only
because
she
can't
figger
'em
out
he
brushed
his
mustache
and
looked
at
tipton
them
people
are
human
bein's
ain't
they
tipton
scowled
but
nodded
anything
they
done
that
couldn't
be
explained
by
natural
causes
no
matter
how
silly
or
complicated
tipton
thought
about
it
and
had
to
shake
his
head
believe
me
boys
the
only
thing
to
get
excited
about
is
the
stuff
that's
missin'
if
they're
pinchin'
it
we
can
catch
'em
and
punish
'em
they
may
be
foreigners
but
they
sure
as
hell
have
to
obey
the
law
of
the
land
now
hammond
said
we're
talking
sense
give
me
a
list
of
what's
missin'
watson
added
an'
i'll
go
to
dark
valley
this
afternoon
and
take
a
look
around
the
place
everybody
satisfied
jerry
asked
everybody
was





sheriff
watson
frowned
at
the
list
as
jerry
drove
into
the
first
barnyard
they
scattered
chickens
ducks
and
children--seen
blurrily
as
they
scrambled
to
hide
they
remained
a
few
minutes
ostensibly
visiting
then
went
on
to
the
next
farm
and
the
next
beyond
the
last
one
on
the
rise
that
led
to
the
carver
cabin
jerry
stopped
the
car
they
looked
at
one
another
watson
rubbed
his
face
irritably
i'm
beat
jerry
there's
somethin'
here
i
can't
get
my
hands
nor
my
head
onto
i
know
the
sheriff
banged
one
big
hand
against
the
crumpled
list
that
butter
churn
of
mulford's
by
god
i
saw
it
same
brand
same
color
even
had
scratches
around
the
base
where
that
old
cat
of
his
sharpened
her
claws
i
know
jerry
said
again
but
it
had
a
letter
'z'
cut
into
it
worn
and
weathered
so
you'd
swear
it
had
been
there
for
years
and
years
that
spring-toothed
harrow
of
zimmerman's
except
the
one
we
saw
had
twelve
teeth
instead
of
fifteen
and
even
the
man
who
made
it
couldn't
find
where
it
had
been
altered
or
tampered
with
it
had
been
the
same
with
a
score
of
other
things
each
one
slightly
changed
just
different
enough
to
make
identification
impossible
to
prove
slowly
jerry
said
wood
gets
weathered
metal
oxidizes
honest
wear
is
unmistakable
and
these
all
take
time
which
can't
be
faked
his
implication
hung
in
the
air
if
the
things
had
been
stolen
then
altered
to
avoid
identification
whoever
did
it
had
more
than
human
ability
magic
watson
muttered
there's

no

such

thing
no
there
absolutely
ain't
they
sat
looking
with
troubled
eyes
out
over
dark
valley
till
jerry
said
abruptly
i'm
going
on
up
to
see
the
carvers
watson
reached
for
the
door
handle
they
don't
have
no
use
for
me
i'll
wait
here
i
got
plenty
to
think
about
jerry
nodded
the
sheriff
would
be
remembering
the
seeds
already
sprouting
in
the
kitchen
gardens
the
leaves
that
had
jumped
out
on
the
old
fruit
trees
the
lambs
and
calves
capering
in
pastures
washed
with
the
green
of
new
grass
the
road
was
smooth
its
ditches
cleared
and
deepened
bright
clothing
napped
on
shiny
new
clotheslines
those
were
on
the
list
but
how
can
you
identify
a
roll
of
wire
cordwood
was
stacked
in
every
yard
new
shingles
spotted
the
roofs
the
windows
held
glass
again
fresh
paint
glistened
on
porches
in
the
fields
corn
and
oats
and
hay
were
shooting
upward
jerry
found
the
carvers
waiting
for
him
their
wrinkled
old
faces
tense
they
didn't
answer
his
greeting
just
jerked
their
heads
they
led
him
past
the
cabin
through
open
brush
and
halted
at
a
bare
place
slowly
jerry
sank
to
his
knees
except
for
its
size
it
could
have
been
a
splayed-out
cougar
print
but
it
was
two
feet
across
and
pressed
more
than
an
inch
into
the
hard
dry
soil
finally
ed
carver
nudged
jerry
the
gnarled
finger
pointed
to
a
twig
of
wild
lilac
eight
feet
off
the
ground
caught
on
the
twig
were
several
coarse
black
hairs
six
inches
long
jerry
looked
from
them
back
to
the
carvers
then
down
at
the
ground
again
he
didn't
speak
what
was
there
to
say
as
they
started
back
toward
the
cabin
ed
carver
said
harshly
we
found
that
two
nights
ago
jerry
brooded
for
some
distance
then
he
said
ned
ames
has
the
best
hunting
dogs
in
the
country
they
looked
at
him
disgustedly
dammit
you
have
to
do
something
come
back
to
town
with
me
we'll
get
some
of
the
boys
together
and
hunt
it
down
they
had
passed
the
cabin
and
reached
the
car
the
carver
brothers
looked
out
over
dark
valley
and
shook
their
heads
we've
lived
alone
ed
said
we'll
fight
alone
when
jerry
told
the
sheriff
about
the
giant
spoor
watson
gave
a
derisive
snort
those
old
coots
got
bats
in
their
belfries
but
i
saw
the
print
watson
dismissed
such
evidence
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
they
made
it
up
probably
forget
it
till
you
see
the
animal
itself
you'll
have
time
to
believe
it
then
we
got
enough
to
worry
about
already
jerry
couldn't
forget
it
but
there
was
a
kind
of
reassurance
in
such
hearty
skepticism
with
each
passing
minute
that
huge
print
seemed
more
unreal





halfway
through
the
valley
they
stopped
to
look
at
the
river
the
bed
was
half
full--muddy
debris-laden
with
a
sheen
of
dust
on
the
surface
but
it
was
water--wet
tangible
undeniable
watson
took
off
his
hat
and
rubbed
his
head
and
swore
good
afternoon
they
turned
joe
merklos
was
smiling
at
them
hello
jerry
said
watson
just
glowered
merklos
moved
beside
them
and
looked
down
his
brilliant
teeth
flashed
good
is
it
not
the
guttural
words
came
out
flat
one
at
a
time
as
though
shaped
carefully
better
than
money
in
this
part
of
the
world
jerry's
eyes
narrowed
did
you
know
about
the
water
when
you
bought
the
valley
merklos
smiled
again
he
was
bare-headed
dressed
in
dark
trousers
and
a
loose
short-sleeved
blouse
his
neck
and
muscular
forearms
gleamed
bronze
in
the
sunlight
you
like
what
we
do
here
he
asked
in
his
deep
hesitant
manner
you've
done
wonders
watson
said
shortly
merklos'
smoky
eyes
held
jerry's
my
people
are
used
to
work
slowly
significantly
watson
said
the
thing
we
don't
understand
is
how
you
managed
to
bring
so
much
equipment
the
exact
things
you
needed--right
down
to
the
last
nail
merklos'
inscrutable
gaze
swung
around
the
smile
lingered
on
his
face
we
are
a
careful
people
we
plan
a
long
way
ahead
watson
opened
his
mouth
for
another
question--and
shut
it
merklos'
attention
had
left
them
the
man
was
listening
his
head
slightly
cocked
after
a
moment
he
turned
i
am
happy
to
see
you
making
a
visit
i
hope
you
come
again
he
nodded
and
walked
swiftly
away
wordlessly
jerry
and
the
sheriff
got
back
in
the
car
could
you
hear
what
he
was
listening
to
jerry
muttered
i
didn't
hear
a
thing
notice
anything
else
about
dark
valley





watson
shook
his
head
no
flowers
not
one
dog
jerry's
hand
tightened
on
the
steering-wheel
and
who
has
ever
gotten
a
single
clear
look
at
one
of
the
kids
jerry
spent
a
restless
night
on
the
way
to
his
office
the
next
morning
he
met
watson
talking
to
a
farmer
on
the
courthouse
steps
listen
to
carson
here
the
sheriff
said
grimly
carson's
straw
hat
bobbed
as
he
talked
i'm
waitin'
to
see
the
farm
adviser
somethin's
gone
wrong
out
at
my
place
on
the
south
fork
i'm
on
good
bottom
land--highest
yield
in
the
county
but
in
the
last
two
three
weeks
my
corn
my
wheat
even
my
berries
has
stopped
growin'
jerry's
eyes
jumped
to
watson
yep
carson
went
on
every
single
ear
o'
corn
is
still
a
nubbin
he
threw
out
his
arms
and
by
god
even
my
wife's
radishes
has
stood
still
ain't
anything
on
earth
that'll
slow
up
a
radish
how
about
other
stuff
how
about
eggs
same
thing
cut
right
down
hens
lay
one
in
ten
now
mebbe
an'
my
alfalfa
has
turned
a
funny
gray-green
even
the
fruit--
what
about
the
river
watson
broke
in
you
still
got
water
in
the
south
fork
way
down
for
this
time
o'
year
but
we
got
enough
several
people
had
stopped
to
listen
one
of
them
a
big
tow-headed
swede
burst
out
excitedly
mister
you
got
the
same
trouble
as
my
cousin
his
crops
they're
growin'
backwards
there
was
more
of
the
same
impossible
talk
jerry
made
an
excuse
to
get
away
to
his
office
he
sat
at
his
desk
and
stared
out
the
window
there
wasn't
any
problem
he
tried
to
tell
himself
anything
he
could
not
measure
by
experience
and
logic
was
out
and
that
had
to
include
giant
paw-prints
and
mysteriously
missing
objects
as
well
as
radishes
that
wouldn't
grow
dark
valley
was
taking
on
life
and
freshness
fact
the
south
fork
and
portions
of
the
north
fork
seemed
to
be
losing
fertility
fact
but
to
conclude
from
this
that
dark
valley
was
gaining
at
the
expense
of
the
others--that
was
the
road
no
reasonable
man
could
allow
himself
to
take
from
his
window
he
saw
the
huge
old
trees
that
shaded
wide
bend
they
looked
suddenly
wrong
weren't
they
less
green
less
thick
than
before
the
buildings
and
streets
looked
dingier
too
and
when
did
all
those
broken
fences
cracked
windows
missing
shingles
show
up
jerry
lunged
from
his
chair
and
strode
up
and
down
the
room
then
the
telephone
bell
tore
through
his
nerves
he
grabbed
the
instrument
watson
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
two
boys
have
been
reported
missin'
no
the
simmons
kids
but
they've
run
away
before
they'll
be
back
jerry's
hand
went
slowly
down
the
sheriff's
voice
echoed
hollowly
from
the
lowered
receiver
well
won't
they





it
was
after
midnight
when
the
doorbell
rang
it
didn't
wake
jerry--he
was
sitting
in
bed
staring
into
the
darkness
there
was
a
pile
of
books
beside
him
he
knocked
them
over
getting
up
to
answer
the
door
mike
carver
stumbled
in
he
dropped
into
a
chair
panting
jerry
went
for
a
bottle
and
glass
carver
gulped
the
drink
then
held
the
tumbler
out
for
another
i
run
all
the
way
down
the
ridge
he
gasped
till
i
catched
a
ride
i
figgered
you
ought
to
know
what
happened
it
got
my
brother
ed
jerry's
lean
face
hardened
yeah
it
was
prowlin'
around
we
went
after
it
an'
shot
it
but
you
said

i
said
it
killed
ed
the
old
lips
tightened
we
gave
it
one
slug
through
the
heart
and
one
through
the
head
they
didn't
even
slow
it
down
you
mean
jerry
asked
carefully
that
they
didn't
have
any
effect
at
all
mike
nodded
he
tipped
the
glass
wiped
his
ragged
sleeve
across
his
face
and
rose
where
are
you
going
back
to
the
cabin
mike
you
can't
go
there
that's
where
my
brother's
body
is
look
jerry
said
evenly
you
can't
help
him
now
stay
here
with
me
and
we'll
go
up
in
the
morning
carver
shook
his
head
my
brother's
there
at
the
cabin
i
got
to
set
up
with
him
there
was
no
arguing
against
that
tone
of
simple
and
utter
finality
all
right
wait
till
i
get
some
clothes
on
and
i'll
drive
you
back
a
few
minutes
later
they
passed
through
wide
bend's
deserted
streets
and
started
out
the
road
to
the
valley
carver
rolled
down
his
window
and
spat
tobacco
juice
feller
was
up
to
see
us
he
said
gloomily
told
us
people
was
losin'
things
all
over
the
county--includin'
two
kids
said
crops
has
shrunk
said
water
in
the
forks
is
way
down
he's
right
said
people
were
gettin'
the
idea
dark
valley
was
livin'
off
the
rest
of
the
land
feedin'
on
it
like
a
parasite
how
crazy
you
think
that
is





slowly
jerry
said
i'm
not
sure
it's
crazy
at
all
carver
brooded
i
shot
that
thing
tonight
should
'a
been
dead
if
a
critter
ever
was
then
i
seen
it
go
after
ed
you
know
what
all
this
means
don't
you
witchcraft
something
people
haven't
believed
in
for
hundreds
of
years
mebbe
they
better
get
started
again
they
were
nearing
the
divide
that
overlooked
dark
valley
mike
i've
been
reading
up
on
it
for
hours
everything
i
could
find
and
it
fits
it's
been
the
hardest
struggle
i
ever
had--admitting
such
a
thing
existed
but
it
was
either
acknowledge
that
or
lose
my
mind
the
night
seemed
colder
as
they
started
downward
unaccountably
the
headlights
dimmed
somethin'
watchin'
us
carver
said
suddenly
as
the
car
bored
on
through
the
thick
and
swirling
darkness
jerry
nodded
his
hands
gripped
the
wheel
until
the
knuckles
were
white
sweat
began
to
glisten
on
his
forehead
the
headlights
picked
out
a
dark
spot
that
looked
like
a
yawning
hole
jerry
stamped
on
the
brake
skidded
slightly
but
there
was
only
a
shallow
rut
deformed
by
shadows
he
pressed
the
accelerator

and
the
motor
died
hurriedly
he
jabbed
the
starter
button
pumped
the
gas
pedal
again
he
pushed
it
and
again
as
the
lights
faded
from
the
drain
on
the
battery
what's
the
matter
carver's
old
voice
was
thin
flooded
maybe
better
let
her
sit
a
minute
the
darkness
pressed
close
around
them
shifted
and
danced
chill
air
moved
over
their
faces
mike
yeah
why
didn't
that
animal
come
after
you
too
carver
breathed
heavily
for
a
moment
then
he
took
something
from
his
shirt
pocket
and
held
it
out
jerry's
fingers
moved
over
it
a
crucifix
my
mother
give
it
to
me
a
long
time
ago
that's
probably
the
only
thing
that
could
have
saved
you
from
what
i
read
they
can't
stand
a
cross
and
silver's
got
something
to
do
with
it
jerry
reached
into
his
own
pocket
feel
this
carver's
rough
hand
fumbled
over
the
object
made
it
this
evening
took
a
cold
chisel
and
hammer
to
an
old
silver
tray
not
fancy
but
it
was
all
i
had
you
done
that
before
i
came
and
told
you
about
ed
jerry
nodded
grimly
i'm
convinced
we're
up
against
something
terrible
and
believe
me
mike
i'm
scared





the
shadows
drew
closer
thicker
still
they
seemed
charged
with
menace
with
a
catch
in
his
voice
jerry
said
maybe
now's
the
time
to
try
it
carver's
head
jerked
around
i
mean
smash
merklos
and
his
tribe
for
good
how
with
fire
and
the
silver
crosses
after
a
long
pause
carver
said
what
about
ed
we'll
get
to
your
cabin
we're
not
far
from
the
first
farm
we
can
go
right
up
the
valley
if
it
works
and
if
it
don't
we
might
end
up
like
ed
carver
turned
and
spat
out
the
window
i
don't
want
to
but
i
will
they
got
out
of
the
car
into
the
humming
darkness
they
took
gunny
sacks
and
rags
from
the
trunk
compartment
and
soaked
them
in
oil
from
the
crankcase
they
wired
a
bundle
on
the
extension
handle
of
the
jack
and
another
on
the
radio
aerial
rod
which
jerry
unscrewed
they
tried
to
start
the
car
once
more
without
success
so
they
turned
off
the
lights
and
left
it
with
one
torch
burning
they
started
up
the
road
for
the
first
gate
dark
valley's
shadowy
legions
closed
in
there
was
a
rustling
and
a
whispering
all
around
them
there
were
shiny
glints
where
none
ought
to
be
there
was
an
overwhelming
feeling
that
something
frightful
waited--just
beyond
the
edge
of
darkness
the
gate
carver
said
hoarsely
jerry
unclenched
his
jaws
and
lit
the
second
torch
the
flare-up
reflected
from
the
blank
windows
ahead
what
about
the
wimmen
what
about
the
kids
jerry
spoke
jerkily
his
eyes
on
the
house
there
aren't
any
kids
what
we
saw
was
something
else
the
women
are
the
same
as
the
men
the
same
as
the
thing
that
killed
ed
don't
worry
about
them
hold
the
cross
in
front
of
you
and
for
god's
sake
hang
onto
it
the
darkness
swelled
like
a
living
thing
it
swayed
and
clutched
at
the
torches
somewhere
a
high
whining
began
like
a
keening
wind
there
were
sudden
sounds
from
the
house--bangings
and
scramblings
carver
faltered
on
jerry
said
savagely
and
began
to
run
he
touched
his
home-made
crucifix
to
the
wood
of
the
porch
and
with
the
other
hand
brought
the
torch
down
blue
sparks
jumped
out
at
him
the
dry
wood
hissed
and
blazed
up
furiously
a
frightful
scream
rang
out
there
was
the
tinkle
of
breaking
glass
formless
figures
thudded
to
the
ground
and
scuttled
away
on
all
fours
headed
up
the
valley
within
minutes
the
farmhouse
was
a
mass
of
roaring
flame
jerry
backed
away
from
it
he
saw
carver
outlined
against
the
glowing
barn
which
he
had
fired
they
came
together
and
hurried
back
to
the
road
there
they
stopped
to
watch
the
pillar
of
flame
and
smoke
boiling
upward
it
worked
carver
said
jerry
nodded
we
can't
kill
them
but
we
can
drive
them
out
wimmen
and
kids
carver
said
bitterly
did
you
see
them
things
that
came
out
yes
jerry
was
drenched
in
sweat
and
the
torch
trembled
in
his
hand
let's
get
on
to
the
next
one
mike
they
went
on
to
the
neighboring
farm
and
to
the
one
after
that
while
the
shadows
pulsed
in
an
unholy
turmoil
the
night
swarmed
with
malignant
invisible
forces
that
tried
to
blow
the
flame
from
their
torches
that
flayed
them
with
the
naked
sword
of
fear
there
were
hideous
shapes
half-seen
there
were
waves
of
terror
like
a
physical
shock
there
were
puffs
of
ordure
so
rank
they
gagged
but
they
plodded
through
it
faces
set
sweating
and
agonized
till
halfway
up
the
valley
it
came
carver
knew
it
first
his
leathery
face
paled
his
hands
fumbled
instinctively
for
the
gun
he
was
not
carrying
then
jerry
said
hoarsely
mike
did
you
hear
that
carver
nodded
dumbly
clearly
now
came
the
sound
of
those
huge
paws
padding
first
on
one
side
of
them
then
the
other
jerry
clutched
his
cross
till
the
rough
edges
bit
deep
into
his
hand
it
seemed
that
his
very
life
was
bound
up
with
the
torch
that
now
smoked
and
struggled
to
burn
if
its
feeble
flame
went
out
that
meant
extinction
black
and
final
then
he
became
aware
that
carver
was
no
longer
beside
him
he
whirled
ten
yards
behind
the
other
was
bending
down
scrabbling
frantically
in
the
dust
i
dropped
it
he
shouted
i
can't
find
it
jerry
tried
to
reach
him
but
the
other
thing
was
quicker
a
whirlpool
of
blackness
engulfed
carver
blotted
him
out
then
jerry
was
confronted
by
an
unbelievable
sight--a
great
savage
head
towering
over
him
its
eyes
glowing
redly
and
foam
creaming
over
gigantic
open
jaws





desperately
he
shoved
his
cross
straight
at
it
the
thing
spat
and
roared
deafeningly
the
thud
of
its
paws
shook
the
ground
it
lashed
out
with
monstrous
claws
that
sliced
his
skin
half-stunned
jerry
kept
lunging
toward
it
till
finally
his
cross
touched
its
coarse
hide
there
was
a
crackle
of
blue
flame
a
shriek
that
split
the
night
and
the
thing
disintegrated
in
roiling
clouds
of
bitter
smoke
jerry
swayed
the
hand
that
held
the
cross
was
numb
and
tingling
like
an
automaton
he
turned
went
back
and
knelt
beside
the
crumpled
shape
that
had
been
mike
carver
then
he
rose
still
carrying
the
feebly
flickering
torch
and
plodded
on
they
met
him
as
he
was
coming
back--watson
henderson
caruso
miller
hammond
and
the
rest
they
had
flashlights
and
guns
and
tear
gas
and
their
faces
were
grim
and
desperate
we
found
your
car
they
said
we
could
see
the
flames
from
wide
bend
what
in
hell
has
been
going
on
jerry
stared
at
them
he
dropped
the
dead
torch
one
hand
tried
to
put
the
cross
back
into
his
pocket
his
face
was
black
his
hair
singed
his
side
wet
with
blood
it's
all
over
he
croaked
they're
gone
